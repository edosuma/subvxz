00:42.594 --> 00:45.181
Friendships in
New York are like encounters

00:45.183 --> 00:46.768
on a bus.

00:46.770 --> 00:49.116
You might hit it off right away,

00:49.118 --> 00:50.910
but only if you're lucky,

00:50.912 --> 00:53.568
you also get off
at the same stop.

01:37.476 --> 01:40.479
New York,
the famous melting pot.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.411
Here are some of the
young and beautiful

01:43.413 --> 01:45.689
that found their
way to the city.

01:45.691 --> 01:49.831
Posting their saturated
Brooklyn lives on Instagram,

01:49.833 --> 01:52.112
attracting even more
from all over the world.

01:53.354 --> 01:56.012
All looking for love,
happiness and success.

01:57.186 --> 01:59.498
Just like the two women
we're about to meet,

02:00.879 --> 02:02.225
Maria and Lena.

02:04.193 --> 02:05.882
I just don't know.

02:05.884 --> 02:07.159
This whole new development,

02:07.161 --> 02:09.851
every single guy
I hang out with,

02:09.853 --> 02:12.854
they just want to have
kids like immediately.

02:12.856 --> 02:14.270
Well, take it as a compliment.

02:14.272 --> 02:17.790
I mean they see this big
pile of amazing genes

02:17.792 --> 02:19.965
bundled up in this cute
little package of yours

02:19.967 --> 02:21.451
and they wanna snatch it away.

02:22.935 --> 02:24.866
Haha, but it's
actually very frustrating

02:24.868 --> 02:28.215
because I don't even think
it's about me, you know?

02:28.217 --> 02:29.423
It's about them.

02:29.425 --> 02:31.218
I mean look at
James, he adores you,

02:31.220 --> 02:34.084
and not the idea of you being
with him, know what I mean?

02:35.707 --> 02:38.537
Well, adore us as
much as you like.

02:39.676 --> 02:42.229
I don't know, maybe
he's just too old.

02:42.231 --> 02:43.885
Oh, yeah, we don't do old.

02:43.887 --> 02:45.818
They're wrinkly and
smelly and they go like

02:46.787 --> 02:47.891
Yeah, tell me about it.

02:49.893 --> 02:51.686
Should we get going?

02:51.688 --> 02:53.136
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I think we should.

02:53.138 --> 02:55.276
- Yeah, let's get...
- Oh my God,

02:55.278 --> 02:57.830
the guy's already sitting
in front of your door.

02:57.832 --> 02:58.661
Well, maybe.

02:59.696 --> 03:01.109
No, no, it's on me.

03:01.111 --> 03:01.903
Come on.

03:01.905 --> 03:02.837
No, no, no, my treat.

03:05.978 --> 03:08.979
That's a really cute
bracelet, it really suits you.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.533
Yes, you like it?

03:10.535 --> 03:12.466
- Yeah.
- Wanna try it on?

03:12.468 --> 03:13.296
Thank you.

03:15.333 --> 03:16.918
- It's very nice.
- You can keep it.

03:16.920 --> 03:19.266
- No, come on.
- Yes, my treat.

03:19.268 --> 03:21.164
This is very expensive.

03:21.166 --> 03:24.167
I have like five
of them, it's yours.

03:24.169 --> 03:24.997
Thank you.

03:29.381 --> 03:31.209
Did you ever see this
picture on Facebook

03:31.211 --> 03:34.626
that looks like a roschach
but also like an old lady?

03:34.628 --> 03:36.110
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, that like thing

03:36.112 --> 03:37.905
that if you squint your eyes,

03:37.907 --> 03:40.804
you might see an old lady
or a princess or something?

03:40.806 --> 03:42.014
Or, yeah, or a chichi.

03:43.533 --> 03:46.224
A chichi, that's
your word for it?

03:46.226 --> 03:47.639
Chichi or hooha.

03:49.470 --> 03:52.160
- Well, I don't know...
- Come on, check it out.

03:52.162 --> 03:54.301
- I wanna show you.
- Okay, I'm gonna pull it up.

03:58.859 --> 04:00.065
There, there, you see?

04:00.067 --> 04:01.480
- Oh my God!
- Totally.

04:01.482 --> 04:03.517
Oh my God, you're so right!

04:03.519 --> 04:07.314
It's totally a chichi,
well that's good to know.

04:07.316 --> 04:08.591
Why?

04:08.593 --> 04:10.144
Well, next time a
guy goes down on you

04:10.146 --> 04:13.492
and he squints his eyes, he
might discover a princess?

04:13.494 --> 04:16.495
Yeah, speaking of which,
I gotta go.

04:16.497 --> 04:18.670
Alright, bye, have fun.

04:18.672 --> 04:20.052
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:22.676 --> 04:24.262
Lena and
Maria were best friends,

04:24.264 --> 04:26.298
that kind of close
friendship in your early 30's

04:26.300 --> 04:27.575
when all your real best friends

04:27.577 --> 04:29.543
have become childhood memories.

04:29.545 --> 04:30.785
They met at a charity event

04:30.787 --> 04:32.925
where Maria was part
of the catering group.

04:32.927 --> 04:34.410
Realizing that they
were both European

04:34.412 --> 04:36.343
was a great
conversation starter.

04:36.345 --> 04:38.897
Unfortunately, it
also got Maria fired.

05:16.385 --> 05:17.798
Hey.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.455
You're home early.

05:19.457 --> 05:20.320
Yeah.

05:21.838 --> 05:23.046
Did you guys have fun?

05:29.743 --> 05:30.571
Yeah.

05:32.193 --> 05:34.090
Looks like you had fun, huh?

05:34.092 --> 05:34.920
What?

05:36.957 --> 05:39.580
Oh, yeah, they just left.

05:40.961 --> 05:41.789
They?

05:45.621 --> 05:46.896
I just,

05:46.898 --> 05:49.174
I just saw her.

05:49.176 --> 05:51.454
I just saw her.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.180
What?

05:55.078 --> 05:58.599
I just saw that
woman leave our house.

05:59.980 --> 06:02.532
No, remember, I
told you about this.

06:02.534 --> 06:04.085
I was having a friend
over for a drink?

06:04.087 --> 06:06.124
You know, it's just a
colleague from work.

06:07.228 --> 06:08.747
We talked about this, remember?

06:12.199 --> 06:14.926
Hey, it's fine, hey, come here.

06:20.794 --> 06:23.900
Oh my God, you
even smell like her.

06:25.626 --> 06:27.592
Oh shit, oh shit!

06:27.594 --> 06:29.801
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- What are you doing?

06:29.803 --> 06:31.043
I'm looking!

06:31.045 --> 06:31.872
Looking for what?

06:31.874 --> 06:33.047
I don't know!

06:34.359 --> 06:37.015
Lena, you're
being ridiculous!

06:39.537 --> 06:41.882
So, is this like
a one time thing

06:41.884 --> 06:43.955
or has this been
going on for a while?

06:46.751 --> 06:47.545
What?

06:48.960 --> 06:52.306
Listen, you are really
stressed out, Lena, okay?

06:52.308 --> 06:53.790
Don't put this on me.

06:53.792 --> 06:55.067
No, listen, I'm not
trying to put it on you.

06:55.069 --> 06:58.485
All I'm trying to say is
that we're both working

06:58.487 --> 07:01.246
through a lot of problems
right now and just...

07:01.248 --> 07:02.730
That's not an excuse!

07:02.732 --> 07:04.836
Listen, let's just, can
we please sit down and talk?

07:04.838 --> 07:06.354
Please?

07:06.356 --> 07:08.356
- Please, can we just...
- Don't fucking touch me!

07:08.358 --> 07:09.187
Okay, fine.

07:22.131 --> 07:22.994
I'm leaving.

07:29.069 --> 07:29.897
Fine.

07:30.726 --> 07:31.554
Go.

07:34.730 --> 07:35.558
Go.

07:41.875 --> 07:43.426
Lena!

07:43.428 --> 07:44.256
Fuck.

08:00.997 --> 08:02.272
- Strawberry?
- Nm-nm.

08:03.172 --> 08:04.482
Come on.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.655
- Just one.
- No, no.

08:05.657 --> 08:07.485
Just a strawberry.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.831
Can't you see I'm smoking?

08:08.833 --> 08:10.315
Yes, I can see that.

08:10.317 --> 08:11.903
Didn't you say you
wanted to quit anyway?

08:11.905 --> 08:13.354
Well, I've changed my mind.

08:14.735 --> 08:18.047
Again, and again, and again,
always changing your mind.

08:18.049 --> 08:19.911
That's what I'm talking about.

08:19.913 --> 08:21.602
You can't commit to anything.

08:21.604 --> 08:22.810
Man, what's your problem?

08:22.812 --> 08:24.985
We're having great
sex, we're having fun,

08:24.987 --> 08:27.574
I don't want anything of
you, you should be happy.

08:27.576 --> 08:29.299
Yes, but I'm not happy.

08:29.301 --> 08:30.130
Why?

08:32.581 --> 08:33.409
Look,

08:34.409 --> 08:36.443
- you're 30 years old...
- I'm 29.

08:36.446 --> 08:37.551
Okay, almost 30.

08:38.621 --> 08:41.139
Do you know what that means, hm?

08:41.140 --> 08:44.142
You're on your best years,
don't waste them around.

08:44.144 --> 08:46.144
You should have a baby.

08:46.146 --> 08:47.525
- A baby?
- Yeah.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.767
No.

08:48.769 --> 08:50.044
Don't you want to
have a baby with me?

08:50.046 --> 08:51.356
No, I don't want
a baby, no babies.

08:51.358 --> 08:53.531
Wow, women of your generation.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.153
What is wrong
with my generation?

08:55.155 --> 08:56.879
The problem is you
can't commit to anything.

08:57.813 --> 08:59.571
Okay, in a perfect world,

08:59.573 --> 09:02.022
what's an ideal woman for you?

09:02.024 --> 09:03.541
- You're asking?
- Mm-hm.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.371
Okay.

09:05.752 --> 09:08.476
I would like a woman that
bakes a strawberry pie

09:08.478 --> 09:11.928
in the morning, gives me
a blowjob in the night.

09:11.930 --> 09:13.896
You're disgusting,

09:13.898 --> 09:15.932
- that's absolutely disgusting.
- Come on, I was kidding.

09:15.934 --> 09:17.865
- Come on, I was joking!
- No, you're disgusting,

09:17.867 --> 09:19.142
- that's not even funny.
- I was joking about

09:19.144 --> 09:20.074
- the strawberry pie.
- No, you know what?

09:20.076 --> 09:21.282
Just leave, okay?

09:21.284 --> 09:22.560
- What's wrong?
- Just leave, go away.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.733
- No, I want you out.
- Come on, come on.

09:23.735 --> 09:25.563
No, no, leave, leave,
I want you to leave.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.667
- Are you serious?
- Go, leave,

09:26.669 --> 09:28.222
yes, I'm serious, leave.

09:29.845 --> 09:31.985
- Go!
- Okay, I'm going.

09:45.826 --> 09:47.585
As much
as Maria had enough

09:47.587 --> 09:49.241
of men explaining her life,

09:49.243 --> 09:51.381
Lena had enough of her marriage.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.211
She wasn't sure
what she had seen

09:53.213 --> 09:55.144
or if she had seen
anything at all.

09:55.146 --> 09:59.493
Her decision to leave made
her sad, but not sad enough.

09:59.495 --> 10:01.668
This
is Kings Highway.

10:01.670 --> 10:05.672
And her confusion
lead her to Maria's place.

10:05.674 --> 10:08.366
Do you think this has been
going on for a long time?

10:09.850 --> 10:12.439
I mean, I don't know.

10:13.958 --> 10:15.543
I had a strange feeling lately,

10:15.545 --> 10:18.652
we had some problems, but...

10:19.895 --> 10:21.239
I don't know.

10:21.241 --> 10:22.691
I am so sorry.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.693
I mean, James, who
would have thought?

10:26.695 --> 10:29.765
He was always so
concerned about you.

10:29.767 --> 10:32.975
But then again, I've only met
him a couple of times anyway.

10:32.977 --> 10:34.047
What an ass.

10:34.944 --> 10:36.875
Wanna sleep over tonight?

10:36.877 --> 10:40.707
No, thank you, I don't
think I can sleep right now.

10:40.709 --> 10:41.673
Do you want some wine?

10:41.675 --> 10:42.916
I could use a glass of wine.

10:42.918 --> 10:45.712
I had a pretty fucked up
date myself, actually.

10:45.714 --> 10:49.716
Oh my God, you, I totally
forgot, your guy was here.

10:49.718 --> 10:51.372
- I'm sorry, I can, I can...
- Why are you sorry?

10:51.374 --> 10:52.719
No, no, no, stop it.

10:52.721 --> 10:55.342
Relax, you know
what we're gonna do?

10:55.344 --> 10:57.171
We're gonna have a party.

10:57.173 --> 10:58.448
That's it, we're
gonna have a party,

10:58.450 --> 11:00.830
my roommates are not here, so,

11:00.832 --> 11:03.453
we could have some booze
and something to smoke,

11:03.455 --> 11:04.938
- we could have fun.
- I don't know.

11:04.940 --> 11:07.492
That's what we're gonna
do, and it's gonna be great.

11:07.494 --> 11:08.564
I'll take care of it.

11:13.811 --> 11:15.258
This was
Maria's typical way

11:15.260 --> 11:17.019
of handling a crisis.

11:17.021 --> 11:20.056
And Lena, Lena
didn't mind at all.

12:03.688 --> 12:04.516
Morning.

12:05.759 --> 12:06.967
Good morning.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.570
Fuck.

12:25.330 --> 12:26.159
Shoes.

12:31.267 --> 12:32.096
Let's go.

12:35.996 --> 12:38.721
So, what are you gonna do now?

12:38.723 --> 12:41.137
I don't know, I mean,

12:41.139 --> 12:43.346
right now I feel really hungover

12:43.348 --> 12:45.903
so I don't really wanna
wrap my head around it.

12:46.835 --> 12:48.904
Are you getting a divorce?

12:48.906 --> 12:50.942
Wow, um...

12:52.357 --> 12:56.601
I don't even know what
happens to my visa then, so.

12:56.603 --> 12:59.364
Oh shit, yeah, that's true,
you can't get a divorce.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.710
At least you can keep the house.

13:02.712 --> 13:04.678
No, he can stay
at the apartment,

13:04.680 --> 13:07.025
- I don't care about it.
- What, are you crazy?

13:07.027 --> 13:08.924
First of all, it's
an awesome apartment,

13:08.926 --> 13:10.201
and second of all, darling,

13:10.203 --> 13:11.685
you know I love you
but you can't stay

13:11.687 --> 13:14.757
in my shit hole forever,
you gotta get the apartment.

13:14.759 --> 13:17.279
You know, I know it
sounds strange, but,

13:18.452 --> 13:21.212
the apartment, all of
it, never made me happy.

13:21.214 --> 13:23.697
That's bullshit,
we can redecorate.

13:23.699 --> 13:25.216
He's the one who cheated on you,

13:25.218 --> 13:27.149
he has to give
you the apartment.

13:27.151 --> 13:28.909
You gotta conquer that castle!

13:28.911 --> 13:29.841
What?

13:29.843 --> 13:32.154
Conquer the castle.

13:32.156 --> 13:34.259
Maria, I don't think that's
an expression.

13:34.261 --> 13:37.400
Doesn't matter, this
asshole has to go.

13:37.402 --> 13:40.058
I'm gonna conquer
that castle, watch me.

13:40.060 --> 13:42.405
Oh my God, Maria,
you're crazy.

14:30.593 --> 14:31.765
Where were you?

14:31.767 --> 14:33.008
I was worried all night.

14:33.010 --> 14:34.664
I don't think you care.

14:34.666 --> 14:35.596
Lena, of course I care.

14:35.598 --> 14:36.735
You shitbag!

14:36.737 --> 14:38.392
What is she doing here?

14:38.394 --> 14:39.877
We conquered the castle!

14:39.879 --> 14:41.361
What?

14:41.363 --> 14:44.398
Well, I think it's better
if you leave for a while.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.606
For a while?

14:45.608 --> 14:46.989
Better forever, you
fucking cheater.

14:48.611 --> 14:50.855
Lena, can we talk
about this in private?

14:52.615 --> 14:55.616
I don't think I can
talk to you right now.

14:55.618 --> 14:56.548
See?

14:56.550 --> 14:58.378
Just pack your shit and go.

14:58.380 --> 15:00.554
I already packed my
bags, you can shut up.

15:02.902 --> 15:03.730
Listen,

15:06.560 --> 15:10.081
maybe we both need just some
time to figure this out.

15:12.256 --> 15:14.566
I also need a break.

15:14.568 --> 15:15.397
Okay.

15:17.606 --> 15:18.434
Okay.

15:19.780 --> 15:24.095
So, I'm gonna leave if
that's what you want.

15:25.062 --> 15:25.925
Okay.

15:31.206 --> 15:32.724
See you in a week.

15:36.038 --> 15:38.107
Wow, that was easy.

15:38.109 --> 15:39.248
What now?

15:45.358 --> 15:46.667
What are you doing?

15:46.669 --> 15:49.741
I'm gonna burn
his fucking clothes!

15:53.469 --> 15:54.744
Fuck, fuck.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.231
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

15:57.335 --> 15:58.783
- Yes, there we go.
- That's not gonna work.

15:58.785 --> 16:00.681
Yeah, it's gonna
work, you see?

16:04.239 --> 16:07.619
There you go, there
you go, oh, oh!

16:07.621 --> 16:09.104
Fuck, fuck!

16:12.764 --> 16:15.008
Fuck, oh my God.

16:19.116 --> 16:20.634
Just leave them here.

16:21.773 --> 16:22.602
Okay.

16:23.948 --> 16:26.259
The pathetic
attempt of burning

16:26.261 --> 16:28.433
her husband's clothes
didn't satisfy Lena's need

16:28.435 --> 16:29.883
of destruction.

16:29.885 --> 16:31.471
James' decision to leave even

16:31.473 --> 16:33.714
caused a brief
flickering or doubt.

16:33.716 --> 16:36.545
As the cold water
ran over her body,

16:36.547 --> 16:37.651
doubt became fear.

16:42.139 --> 16:43.207
Lena?

16:43.209 --> 16:44.139
Yeah?

16:44.141 --> 16:45.416
Can I wear this dress?

16:45.418 --> 16:48.039
Sure, just give me two
minutes, I'll be there.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.249
Okay.

17:02.331 --> 17:03.641
Maria
suggested a night out

17:03.643 --> 17:06.127
and Lena gladly tagged along.

17:08.682 --> 17:10.647
Maria had always
considered the attention

17:10.650 --> 17:12.512
of men to be reassuring.

17:12.513 --> 17:13.823
As long as she had her youth,

17:13.825 --> 17:16.136
and her presence and her beauty,

17:16.137 --> 17:17.346
she would always get by.

17:19.624 --> 17:22.039
Lena was more reserved
in that matter,

17:22.040 --> 17:23.971
but tried to follow her lead.

17:37.194 --> 17:38.469
What are you doing?

17:38.471 --> 17:40.540
You're still wearing
your wedding ring?

17:40.542 --> 17:41.782
Yeah.

17:41.784 --> 17:44.130
I thought you wanted
to have fun tonight.

17:44.132 --> 17:46.132
I'm having fun, I'm dancing!

17:46.134 --> 17:47.066
Take it off.

17:48.239 --> 17:49.549
I, I don't wanna
lose it, come on.

17:49.551 --> 17:51.758
I thought you didn't
care about money.

17:51.760 --> 17:52.588
I don't.

17:54.245 --> 17:56.728
Come on, I'll fix it.

17:56.730 --> 17:57.559
One,

18:00.320 --> 18:01.597
this would work.

18:02.771 --> 18:05.222
- Alright, another round?
- Sure.

18:22.722 --> 18:25.481
Maria and Lena
felt closer than ever before.

18:25.483 --> 18:27.173
Hours went by, lost.

18:27.175 --> 18:28.657
But all that seemed
to matter now

18:28.659 --> 18:31.177
were the possibilities
of the moment.

19:02.210 --> 19:05.834
"Follow your heart,
and you may shine."

19:08.077 --> 19:09.801
What the fuck
does it even mean?

19:09.803 --> 19:12.737
I have no idea,
what does yours say?

19:14.532 --> 19:18.914
"The path to
everything is love."

19:20.400 --> 19:22.262
Oh, God!

19:22.264 --> 19:23.714
Well, yeah, right.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.822
By the way, I had this really
weird dream last night.

19:30.030 --> 19:34.412
I dreamt like either I
was wearing a wig, or,

19:34.414 --> 19:36.485
I had just black
hair, I don't know.

19:37.521 --> 19:38.729
Well, I think...

19:39.902 --> 19:43.249
I was you, if that
makes any sense.

19:43.251 --> 19:45.078
That's a very
interesting dream.

19:45.080 --> 19:45.908
Yeah.

19:47.703 --> 19:49.324
Oh, shit, I gotta go.

19:49.326 --> 19:51.567
- I'm late for work.
- No!

19:51.569 --> 19:53.259
- Yeah.
- No, don't leave me.

19:53.261 --> 19:57.539
Don't, no, quit your job and
stay with me here, please.

19:57.541 --> 19:59.161
Shut up.

20:09.380 --> 20:11.415
Guys, where's my steak frites?

20:16.905 --> 20:17.733
Enjoy.

20:25.914 --> 20:27.983
Maria, a word, please?

20:27.985 --> 20:29.467
Of course.

20:29.469 --> 20:31.987
Listen, when you're on the
floor, you need to smile.

20:31.989 --> 20:35.818
We sell food here, good
makes people happy, right?

20:35.820 --> 20:37.303
- Yeah, okay.
- Do you like working here?

20:37.305 --> 20:38.856
Yeah, I do, I do.

20:38.858 --> 20:41.686
From what I understand,
you need this job.

20:41.688 --> 20:44.206
No other fine dining
establishment is gonna hire you,

20:44.208 --> 20:46.898
so please, adjust your attitude.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.350
- Okay.
- So, let me see it.

20:49.524 --> 20:50.352
Alright.

21:07.024 --> 21:08.506
While
Maria was dealing

21:08.508 --> 21:10.612
with an irrational boss and
the stress of making a living,

21:10.614 --> 21:13.306
Lena sat at home
wondering about mortality.

21:16.482 --> 21:19.690
She had always been fascinated
about life's vulnerability.

21:19.692 --> 21:22.865
A fascination that could
quickly turn into obsession.

21:22.867 --> 21:26.006
Especially when there's
not much else to do.

21:31.704 --> 21:33.462
Bones.

21:33.464 --> 21:34.914
Skin, and bones.

21:37.606 --> 21:38.435
Blood.

21:39.401 --> 21:41.300
White blood cells.

21:42.197 --> 21:44.164
Inflammation.

21:45.545 --> 21:47.961
Hives, pox?

21:48.997 --> 21:50.309
Chicken pox.

21:52.932 --> 21:54.243
Meningitis.

21:59.007 --> 22:01.043
Castleman disease.

22:03.045 --> 22:07.084
Crest disease, lyme disease.

22:08.465 --> 22:09.845
Poems syndrome.

22:11.399 --> 22:12.641
Liver failure.

22:14.298 --> 22:16.058
Kidney failure.

22:20.408 --> 22:21.512
Congenital heart block.

22:34.801 --> 22:35.630
Lina?

22:38.840 --> 22:39.806
Lina?

22:43.431 --> 22:44.432
Lina!

22:48.297 --> 22:50.092
Um, it's actually Leh-na.

22:51.853 --> 22:53.475
The doctor's
ready for you now.

23:12.943 --> 23:14.669
The doctor will
be right with you.

23:16.464 --> 23:18.947
Lena had seen
Dr. Hollis for a while now.

23:18.949 --> 23:21.777
He was kind and patient,
and didn't seem to mind

23:21.779 --> 23:23.952
that she visited him often.

23:23.954 --> 23:26.748
Especially after
last year's incident

23:26.750 --> 23:28.232
of bleeding out a
cluster of cells

23:28.234 --> 23:30.132
that had formed a
fetus inside of her.

23:33.135 --> 23:34.376
Hi, Lena.

23:34.378 --> 23:35.931
- Hi, Doctor Hollis.
- What's going on?

23:36.863 --> 23:38.518
Um,

23:38.520 --> 23:40.865
I just feel all
drained of energy.

23:40.867 --> 23:45.076
I have these headaches,
like right here

23:45.078 --> 23:47.078
and sometimes up here.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.563
I just don't feel that good.

23:48.565 --> 23:50.461
How long has that
been happening?

23:50.463 --> 23:52.808
Um, maybe two months?

23:52.810 --> 23:54.016
Yeah.

23:54.018 --> 23:56.952
Okay, let's take
a look at you.

23:58.851 --> 24:00.437
That looks good.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.335
Look to your left,

24:02.337 --> 24:03.165
let's see.

24:07.273 --> 24:08.583
Well,

24:08.585 --> 24:09.860
you look good to me, I mean,

24:09.862 --> 24:12.621
we can have the nurse
draw some blood,

24:12.623 --> 24:14.554
see if there's any deficiencies,

24:14.556 --> 24:15.831
but other than
that, you look fine.

24:15.833 --> 24:18.903
Okay, yeah, yeah,
let's do that.

24:18.905 --> 24:20.387
Okay.

24:21.770 --> 24:22.976
Their
new living situation

24:22.978 --> 24:25.116
has soon enough provided
a consoling pattern

24:25.118 --> 24:27.153
which tightened
their friendship.

24:27.155 --> 24:28.534
Waking up together
in the morning

24:28.536 --> 24:30.225
and going out together at night.

24:30.227 --> 24:33.953
Today, it was Maria whose
emotions were in turmoil.

24:33.955 --> 24:36.576
Not only was her boss
a pain in the ass,

24:36.578 --> 24:39.648
but her ex-lover had also tried
to call her several times.

24:39.650 --> 24:43.583
My boss, he's so
sleazy, he's so annoying,

24:43.585 --> 24:45.414
he gets on my
nerves all the time.

24:46.554 --> 24:49.278
Ugh, I wish I could do
something about it, but,

24:49.280 --> 24:50.661
he's gonna have me deported.

24:51.904 --> 24:52.732
I'm sorry.

24:53.561 --> 24:55.043
Yeah.

24:55.045 --> 24:58.218
Maybe I should marry an
American just like you did.

24:59.739 --> 25:01.774
Well, we saw how that goes.

25:01.776 --> 25:04.123
Come on, I bet he's
calling you all the time.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.094
This city's just so beautiful.

25:11.199 --> 25:12.027
Is it though?

25:13.477 --> 25:15.546
I remember when I was
a kid and I came here

25:15.548 --> 25:17.446
for the first time on vacation.

25:18.586 --> 25:21.345
I just thought the
city is so sterile,

25:21.347 --> 25:23.243
it doesn't even smell.

25:23.245 --> 25:25.004
Are you crazy?

25:25.006 --> 25:27.834
New York stinks, everywhere.

25:27.836 --> 25:29.458
Must have been a winter holiday.

25:31.253 --> 25:33.288
Christmas shopping.

25:33.290 --> 25:35.152
You spoiled bitch.

25:35.154 --> 25:36.429
Ow!

25:37.639 --> 25:39.294
Come with me, I
have an idea, come.

25:39.296 --> 25:41.745
- Where are you going?
- Just come.

25:41.747 --> 25:43.470
Are you ready?

25:43.472 --> 25:44.920
- Yes.
- One,

25:44.922 --> 25:46.957
- Two, three.
- Two three!

26:00.800 --> 26:01.594
One more!

26:03.285 --> 26:04.526
Enjoy, ladies.

26:04.528 --> 26:06.148
Thank you.

26:06.150 --> 26:11.155
Cheers!

26:11.949 --> 26:14.156
- Another round?
- Sure.

26:14.158 --> 26:15.263
Two more.

26:16.747 --> 26:18.195
- Fuck.
- What?

26:18.197 --> 26:20.061
The guy you're
hooking up with,

26:21.787 --> 26:23.200
he's right over there.

26:23.202 --> 26:24.030
- Where?
- There.

26:26.515 --> 26:28.239
Just ignore him.

26:28.241 --> 26:30.138
He's right there,
he just saw you.

26:30.140 --> 26:32.174
I wanna know more about you.

26:32.176 --> 26:34.349
Did you ever have a proper job?

26:34.351 --> 26:35.937
Are you serious right now?

26:35.939 --> 26:38.215
Yeah, like a proper
job, not advertising...

26:38.217 --> 26:40.702
- Are we really doing this?
- Mm-hm.

26:42.014 --> 26:43.429
Oh, um...

26:44.844 --> 26:49.744
Actually, um, yeah, I once
worked on an assembly line.

26:49.746 --> 26:51.504
One summer, when I was 16,

26:51.506 --> 26:53.299
my dad wanted my sister and me

26:53.301 --> 26:56.060
to experience "the real world,"

26:56.062 --> 26:57.786
which is hilarious
'cause he's spending

26:57.788 --> 27:00.064
all his life in
conference rooms.

27:00.066 --> 27:01.963
Actually, he wanted us
to be lawyers like him,

27:01.965 --> 27:03.035
but yeah, so.

27:04.174 --> 27:06.383
I wanna know more
about the assembly line.

27:07.660 --> 27:08.488
Of course.

27:09.800 --> 27:13.043
It was not that bad, I
mean, the actual labor.

27:13.045 --> 27:16.425
The worst part was that
they were listening

27:16.427 --> 27:19.394
to the same radio
station all day long

27:19.396 --> 27:22.052
and there were only so many pop
songs they played, you know?

27:22.054 --> 27:25.296
That, and they talked
about soap operas a lot.

27:25.298 --> 27:26.679
Poor you.

27:28.060 --> 27:31.406
You were once in a
soap opera, weren't you?

27:31.408 --> 27:32.338
Yes, yes, I was.

27:32.340 --> 27:35.065
What was that name again?

27:37.034 --> 27:39.897
- And that means?
- Heart On Fire.

27:39.899 --> 27:41.485
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

27:41.487 --> 27:43.040
Oh, fuck they're coming over.

27:46.354 --> 27:47.629
Good evening, ladies.

27:47.631 --> 27:48.457
Hi.

27:48.459 --> 27:49.735
Hello.

27:49.737 --> 27:50.667
Would it be cool
if we joined you?

27:50.669 --> 27:52.945
Sure, hi, my name is Lena.

27:52.947 --> 27:54.360
- Rick.
- Nice to meet you.

27:54.362 --> 27:55.706
Hi, I'm Palo.

27:55.708 --> 27:56.880
- Hi, Lena.
- I'm Maria.

27:56.882 --> 27:59.468
- Maria.
- Maria, nice to meet you.

27:59.470 --> 28:01.022
What are you guys drinking?

28:01.024 --> 28:02.644
We had shots.

28:02.646 --> 28:05.785
Yeah, you care
for another one?

28:05.787 --> 28:07.097
- Sure.
- Yeah.

28:07.099 --> 28:08.477
What are you drinking?

28:08.479 --> 28:10.721
- Vodka?
- Sure, alright.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.619
Could we have four more please?

29:26.454 --> 29:28.042
Lena woke up alone.

29:33.737 --> 29:35.532
Neither James nor
Maria were there.

29:40.019 --> 29:42.295
The apartment was awfully quiet

29:42.297 --> 29:44.713
and she felt rather
small and unimportant.

30:24.270 --> 30:26.823
When she closed on eye,
and then the other,

30:26.825 --> 30:28.205
per perspective would shift.

30:29.551 --> 30:31.553
At least one thing
offered her some comfort.

30:33.624 --> 30:35.797
Lena thought of her childhood

30:35.799 --> 30:37.937
and how things were
a little better then.

30:53.921 --> 30:54.853
Lina?

30:58.408 --> 30:59.236
Lina?

31:02.964 --> 31:03.862
Lina!

31:05.933 --> 31:07.141
It's still Leh-na.

31:08.590 --> 31:09.419
Okay.

31:17.703 --> 31:19.876
- Hi, Lena.
- Hi, Dr. Hollis.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.325
Your blood work is not in yet,

31:21.327 --> 31:23.985
is there anything
else I can do for you?

31:25.814 --> 31:26.643
Um...

31:28.127 --> 31:31.268
Uh, yeah, okay, um...

31:39.725 --> 31:41.690
Maria had
a stressful morning.

31:41.692 --> 31:43.969
Her ex-lover, Palo, had
left her several angry

31:43.971 --> 31:46.592
and condescending
messages the night before.

31:46.594 --> 31:48.456
And even though she
liked his passion,

31:48.458 --> 31:51.355
she disliked the ownership
he took over her.

31:51.357 --> 31:53.426
Can I get you anything else?

31:57.260 --> 31:58.984
- Maria, what's up?
- Hi.

31:58.986 --> 32:00.226
How are you?

32:00.228 --> 32:01.676
That's a cute outfit
today, I love it.

32:01.678 --> 32:02.953
- Thank you.
- Is this 100% cotton,

32:02.955 --> 32:04.334
because myself,
I'm a cotton man,

32:04.336 --> 32:06.508
I love 100% cotton,
that's all I wear,

32:06.510 --> 32:08.200
- you know?
- Okay, I'm really busy, Bill,

32:08.202 --> 32:09.410
- bye.
- Alright, see ya.

32:13.103 --> 32:14.861
Hello, may I take your order?

32:14.863 --> 32:15.897
Surprise.

32:15.899 --> 32:17.554
What are you doing here?

32:17.556 --> 32:19.349
- Quit your job.
- I can't.

32:19.351 --> 32:20.591
Yes, you gotta quit your job.

32:20.593 --> 32:22.455
Shut up, I told you, I can't.

32:22.457 --> 32:24.043
What do you want?

32:24.045 --> 32:26.597
Well then, I'll have
the lobster salad, please.

32:26.599 --> 32:28.703
- Are you serious?
- Chop, chop.

32:28.705 --> 32:31.294
I'm gonna spit in your salad.

32:37.886 --> 32:39.472
Both feeling
rather unhappy by themselves

32:39.474 --> 32:41.026
and only happy together,

32:41.028 --> 32:44.790
Maria and Lena decided to
make Lena's dream come true.

32:45.929 --> 32:48.552
They decided to become
the other person.

32:49.795 --> 32:50.934
At least for one night.

34:34.141 --> 34:36.728
"Content is happiness.

34:37.902 --> 34:40.455
Happiness is content."

34:40.456 --> 34:41.286
Okay.

34:46.808 --> 34:48.016
That's interesting.

34:49.156 --> 34:51.949
"What's meant to be
will always find a way."

34:51.951 --> 34:53.192
Hm.

34:53.194 --> 34:55.367
And it's interesting
I get that today.

34:55.369 --> 34:56.920
Why?

34:56.922 --> 34:58.717
I have an audition tomorrow.

34:59.580 --> 35:01.580
Oh my God, that's great!

35:01.582 --> 35:02.408
Yeah, yeah, I know.

35:02.410 --> 35:03.927
What is it for?

35:03.929 --> 35:05.756
It's for a space film.

35:05.758 --> 35:08.106
- Cool!
- Yeah.

35:10.418 --> 35:12.384
Congratulations.

35:12.386 --> 35:15.318
Thank you, I mean, I
didn't get it yet, but,

35:15.320 --> 35:16.562
you know, it'll work out.

35:18.185 --> 35:20.118
Cool, I'm happy for you.

35:22.741 --> 35:25.983
But you promised, you
promised you would stay

35:25.985 --> 35:28.262
with me forever, fuck.

35:42.899 --> 35:44.243
Maria
had the feeling

35:44.245 --> 35:46.038
that this was finally
the opportunity

35:46.040 --> 35:47.488
she had been waiting for.

35:47.490 --> 35:49.559
There was a better version
of herself out there,

35:49.561 --> 35:51.183
and she was close
to becoming it,

35:52.529 --> 35:54.945
if she could only find a
way to calm her nerves.

36:05.128 --> 36:06.336
But you promised.

36:08.752 --> 36:10.651
You promised you
would never leave me.

36:14.827 --> 36:16.827
You promised you would
stay with me forever

36:16.829 --> 36:18.726
in the outer realm space...

36:18.728 --> 36:20.106
Fuck!

36:20.108 --> 36:21.834
Space station.

36:22.835 --> 36:24.320
Space station, space station.

36:36.815 --> 36:38.849
Space station.

36:38.851 --> 36:41.266
No, no, no, outer
realm space station.

36:41.268 --> 36:44.407
But you promised, you promised
you would never leave me.

36:44.409 --> 36:46.581
You promised you would
stay with me forever

36:46.583 --> 36:48.376
in the outer realm
space station,

36:48.378 --> 36:50.829
this is, who the
fuck wrote this?

36:53.521 --> 36:58.352
But you promised, you
promised you would never

36:58.354 --> 36:59.424
leave me.

37:07.501 --> 37:08.329
Fuck.

37:09.296 --> 37:10.295
Lena!

37:10.297 --> 37:11.953
I've got nothing to wear!

37:13.161 --> 37:15.507
I mean, look,
this could work, no?

37:15.509 --> 37:16.439
Wow.

37:16.441 --> 37:19.925
It's futuristic and feminine.

37:19.927 --> 37:21.685
What was the role
description again?

37:21.687 --> 37:25.413
A space steward
determined, by sensual.

37:25.415 --> 37:29.762
Well, this is totally
determined but sensual.

37:30.938 --> 37:32.248
I know, but, you know,

37:32.250 --> 37:34.457
it's too expensive, I can't.

37:34.459 --> 37:36.700
Oh, no, I want you to wear it.

37:36.702 --> 37:39.153
Come on, you can even
keep it if you want.

37:41.155 --> 37:42.225
Thank you.

37:48.369 --> 37:51.957
And do you need any
accessories, any jewelry?

37:51.959 --> 37:53.717
Yeah, but that's,
you know, too much

37:53.719 --> 37:57.273
Not at all, just have
a look, I got plenty.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.069
Okay, thank you!

38:01.831 --> 38:05.039
Wow, this is, this is perfect!

38:05.041 --> 38:07.938
And there's like
this necklace, maybe?

38:07.940 --> 38:09.768
Oh, sure.

38:09.770 --> 38:12.184
Yep!

38:12.186 --> 38:14.117
While Lena was happy
to have helped Maria,

38:14.119 --> 38:15.914
she had her own
business to tend to.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.157
Lina?

38:30.894 --> 38:31.723
Hm...

38:33.932 --> 38:36.624
Your blood work came
back, it looks great.

38:37.625 --> 38:38.419
It's normal,

38:39.662 --> 38:41.111
everything is wonderful.

38:42.285 --> 38:45.288
You're healthy,
just keep trying.

38:53.572 --> 38:56.851
Maybe I'm not the
right doctor for you.

39:00.027 --> 39:00.821
Oh, really?

39:02.719 --> 39:03.891
You know what?

39:03.893 --> 39:06.792
Forget about this, fuck this.

39:10.900 --> 39:12.140
That evening,

39:12.142 --> 39:14.282
both Lena and Maria
seemed awfully tense.

39:18.148 --> 39:19.184
Want more wine?

39:24.500 --> 39:26.120
Who are you texting with?

39:26.122 --> 39:27.986
Don't worry, it's
not your husband.

39:30.091 --> 39:32.920
- Ouch.
- I'm sorry.

39:32.922 --> 39:35.129
I'm so sorry, it's
just this audition,

39:35.131 --> 39:38.581
I'm so stressed about it
and the lines are so bad.

39:38.583 --> 39:40.099
If you want, I can't
rehearse with you.

39:40.101 --> 39:43.588
No, no, actually, I'd
rather go to bed, I'm sorry.

39:49.352 --> 39:50.593
Good night.

40:34.432 --> 40:38.090
Hm, "Fall in love
with your life."

40:39.540 --> 40:42.198
Gotta go, gotta
go to my audition.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.407
Okay, good luck,
break a leg, huh?

40:46.409 --> 40:47.583
See ya later.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.464
Maria,
we're ready for you.

41:15.611 --> 41:17.645
Okay, let's
start with the slate,

41:17.647 --> 41:18.577
what's your name?

41:18.579 --> 41:20.924
My name is Maria Kalitsi.

41:20.926 --> 41:22.478
Hi,
Maria, how tall are you?

41:22.480 --> 41:24.031
I'm five foot six.

41:24.033 --> 41:25.273
Okay, I'd
like to see your profile,

41:25.275 --> 41:26.760
can you turn to
the left, please?

41:28.140 --> 41:29.383
Lovely, and to the right?

41:31.661 --> 41:35.042
Okay, fantastic, let's jump
right in, are you ready?

41:35.044 --> 41:36.181
I'm ready.

41:36.183 --> 41:37.460
And action.

41:40.808 --> 41:43.671
But, you promised me.

41:43.673 --> 41:45.328
You promised you
would stay forever

41:45.330 --> 41:47.986
with me in the outer
realm space station.

41:47.988 --> 41:50.229
But that was
before everything happened.

41:50.231 --> 41:51.888
I don't think I
love you anymore.

41:54.891 --> 41:57.374
Okay, thank you.

41:57.376 --> 41:58.652
Maria, there's one more thing.

41:58.654 --> 42:00.067
You know this love scene,

42:00.069 --> 42:02.379
the one where you're
supposed to be giving the BJ?

42:02.381 --> 42:03.760
Yeah?

42:03.762 --> 42:06.107
The director
would like to know

42:06.109 --> 42:07.730
if you could show him
what you would do.

42:07.732 --> 42:09.732
So, here's a prop.

42:09.734 --> 42:11.285
What do you mean?

42:11.287 --> 42:12.804
Uh,
just, you know,

42:12.806 --> 42:14.946
if you could like show us with
the bottle what you would do.

42:16.603 --> 42:18.085
Are you serious?

42:18.087 --> 42:19.640
Just hold
it up towards your mouth.

42:27.130 --> 42:28.509
While
Maria was auditioning,

42:28.511 --> 42:29.890
Lena had time to think.

42:29.892 --> 42:32.202
Lena felt that they
were both drifting apart

42:32.204 --> 42:33.307
and that she wanted to have

42:33.309 --> 42:35.378
an honest conversation
with Maria.

42:35.380 --> 42:37.207
Lena also wanted to come clean,

42:37.209 --> 42:39.557
and tell Maria what really
happened with James.

42:41.075 --> 42:42.212
Hey.

42:42.214 --> 42:43.628
Hey!

42:43.630 --> 42:46.285
- How did it go?
- Shit.

42:46.287 --> 42:48.496
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure!

42:49.636 --> 42:50.947
What happened?

42:51.707 --> 42:52.570
Maria!

43:03.304 --> 43:04.133
Hi.

43:05.272 --> 43:06.927
Oh, fuck.

43:06.929 --> 43:08.586
Um, Maria,

43:10.449 --> 43:12.797
um, that's my sister.

44:14.341 --> 44:14.790
I am so sorry!

44:36.570 --> 44:37.776
In English: Are you two lesbian?

44:37.778 --> 44:39.502
You and my sister,
are you lovers?

44:39.504 --> 44:40.986
Julia!

44:40.988 --> 44:42.022
I'm sorry.

44:42.024 --> 44:43.092
Okay, you know what, guys?

44:43.094 --> 44:44.820
I better leave you two alone.

44:46.856 --> 44:49.894
Maria, you don't have
to go, I'm sorry, Maria?

45:35.353 --> 45:36.699
Mhm.

47:39.235 --> 47:40.685
I am so sorry.

47:54.561 --> 47:55.905
While Lena
was still contemplating

47:55.907 --> 47:58.183
her complicated relationship
with her sister,

47:58.185 --> 47:59.944
Maria felt like
burning down a house

47:59.946 --> 48:01.982
or destroying an
expensive Chinese vase.

48:03.501 --> 48:05.570
Anything would do that
could lighten the anger

48:05.572 --> 48:07.885
and disappointment she
felt growing inside her.

48:09.334 --> 48:12.199
So, she first turned to
alcohol, and then to sex,

48:13.649 --> 48:15.511
two things that had worked
out for her in the past.

48:27.007 --> 48:28.317
Another round?

48:28.319 --> 48:29.216
It's on the house.

48:31.287 --> 48:33.978
Sounds tempting, but um...

48:33.980 --> 48:35.600
I think I shouldn't.

48:35.602 --> 48:37.293
Yeah, I know that feeling.

48:39.088 --> 48:41.606
I do serve more than
drinks though, you know.

49:35.041 --> 49:37.248
Maria
stopped at a playground,

49:37.250 --> 49:40.078
trying to remember how easy
it was when she was a child.

49:40.080 --> 49:41.907
But she couldn't.

49:49.917 --> 49:50.780
My ball.

49:51.989 --> 49:53.712
What, you're not
gonna apologize?

49:53.714 --> 49:55.024
You just hit me.

49:55.026 --> 49:56.131
Where are you manners?

49:58.271 --> 49:59.272
You know what?

50:00.549 --> 50:02.240
Here's your ball, bye now.

50:03.310 --> 50:05.000
Bitch.

50:59.504 --> 51:01.435
When they
woke up the next morning,

51:01.437 --> 51:03.955
they were both still so
absorbed in their own troubles

51:03.957 --> 51:05.991
that they could not
even face each other.

51:29.155 --> 51:30.015
Maria, what's up?

51:30.017 --> 51:31.569
- Hi.
- How you doing?

51:31.571 --> 51:33.053
- Good.
- You look so great today.

51:33.055 --> 51:35.538
I love your hair, are you doing
something different with it?

51:35.540 --> 51:37.092
- You look fantastic.
- Mm-hm, I'm really busy,

51:37.094 --> 51:38.300
- I'm so sorry, Bill.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,

51:38.302 --> 51:40.994
well, you know, alright, see ya.

51:47.173 --> 51:48.965
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

51:48.967 --> 51:50.381
You know, you look
so familiar to me.

51:50.383 --> 51:51.658
Yeah?

51:51.660 --> 51:52.624
Yeah, do I know
you from somewhere?

51:52.626 --> 51:55.006
Um, no, no I don't think so.

51:55.008 --> 51:56.283
Are you Greek?

51:56.285 --> 51:58.320
Yes, yes, I'm Greek, yeah.

51:58.322 --> 51:59.495
Okay, um...

52:03.292 --> 52:04.500
You're on that TV show!

52:05.536 --> 52:06.776
Yeah, right?

52:06.778 --> 52:08.192
Yeah, I used to watch it
every summer in Greece

52:08.194 --> 52:10.918
with my grandparents, my
grandparents are from Kefalonia.

52:10.920 --> 52:12.644
Yeah, what are you doing here?

52:12.646 --> 52:13.852
Um, I'm working here.

52:13.854 --> 52:15.546
Yeah, why are
you waiting tables?

52:16.926 --> 52:18.031
I moved to New York.

52:21.207 --> 52:22.758
- Maria?
- Yes?

52:22.760 --> 52:24.760
For the last time,
you need to be friendly.

52:24.762 --> 52:25.968
I am friendly.

52:25.970 --> 52:27.349
No, you're a pretty girl.

52:27.351 --> 52:30.214
This city is filled
with pretty girls.

52:30.216 --> 52:32.802
Girls who would
love the opportunity

52:32.804 --> 52:34.494
to work at my restaurant.

52:34.496 --> 52:37.635
Girls who would personally
thank me for the opportunity.

52:37.637 --> 52:40.364
Personally thank me
for the opportunity.

52:41.365 --> 52:42.847
Okay, that's it.

52:42.849 --> 52:44.089
Come on, Maria,
you don't need to...

52:44.091 --> 52:45.677
- I quit.
- You don't have to do this.

52:45.679 --> 52:46.611
Fuck you.

52:47.474 --> 52:49.233
Maria, come back, Maria!

53:10.083 --> 53:11.565
Hey.

53:11.567 --> 53:12.396
Hi.

53:17.608 --> 53:18.816
Can I buy you a drink?

53:20.611 --> 53:21.439
Sure.

53:45.601 --> 53:47.014
No,

53:47.016 --> 53:47.912
please, please.

53:47.914 --> 53:49.327
- What?
- Stop.

53:49.329 --> 53:50.572
Did I do
something wrong?

53:51.849 --> 53:53.609
No, I'm sorry.

53:57.820 --> 53:59.166
Please, I can't.

54:00.409 --> 54:01.546
What?

54:01.548 --> 54:02.377
I'm sorry,

54:04.689 --> 54:06.243
I just can't, I can't.

54:20.705 --> 54:22.259
Can I at least jerk off on you?

54:29.335 --> 54:30.817
Lena!

54:30.819 --> 54:32.819
Lena, I quit my job!

54:32.821 --> 54:35.339
Lena, Lena!

54:35.341 --> 54:37.064
I quit my job!

54:37.066 --> 54:38.721
- What?
- I quit my...

54:38.723 --> 54:39.688
Hi.

54:39.690 --> 54:42.207
Oh, are we having a party now?

54:42.209 --> 54:44.451
Uh, sorry, I didn't
know you had company.

54:44.453 --> 54:46.591
Well, actually, he
was just about to leave.

54:46.593 --> 54:47.937
- Oh.
- Oh.

54:47.939 --> 54:49.389
- Okay.
- Okay.

54:57.466 --> 54:58.329
Know what?

55:00.366 --> 55:02.711
I think we should
go to the Hamptons.

55:02.713 --> 55:04.644
- Now?
- Yes, now.

55:04.646 --> 55:06.231
I know this guy, he has a house.

55:06.233 --> 55:07.027
Let's go.

55:08.028 --> 55:09.511
Hm.

55:09.513 --> 55:10.479
Come on, we need
to get out of the city.

55:12.619 --> 55:13.929
Okay.

55:34.917 --> 55:37.262
That's disgusting,
you're disgusting.

55:37.264 --> 55:38.850
- Here.
- No, no, no!

55:45.652 --> 55:46.617
No, show me.

55:46.619 --> 55:47.894
Oh, I can't, it'd be like,

55:49.069 --> 55:52.381
- no, no, no, I don't...
- Are you cold?

55:55.248 --> 55:56.974
That's a man horse.

56:00.978 --> 56:02.011
No?

56:02.013 --> 56:03.530
Come on.

56:03.532 --> 56:05.120
I'll do a turtle.

56:08.468 --> 56:11.366
- Wait.
- Okay, I'm waiting.

56:35.046 --> 56:36.011
Maria!

56:36.013 --> 56:37.115
Okay, this is it.

56:37.117 --> 56:38.634
Maria, what are you doing?

56:38.636 --> 56:40.464
- Come on, get up.
- What if someone's home?

56:40.466 --> 56:41.982
There's no one home,
he has like five houses,

56:41.984 --> 56:43.777
that's why he used to
bring me here all the time.

56:43.779 --> 56:46.608
- Are you kidding me?
- Come on, it's gonna be fine.

56:46.610 --> 56:48.543
- Trust me.
- Oh my God.

56:49.923 --> 56:51.164
What's going on?

56:51.166 --> 56:51.994
Come on.

56:53.133 --> 56:55.651
Fuck, the keys, he
always leaves the keys.

56:55.653 --> 56:56.482
Okay.

56:57.690 --> 56:58.965
Maria!

56:58.967 --> 57:00.484
Maria!

57:00.486 --> 57:01.487
Fuck, fuck.

57:04.351 --> 57:05.732
Shit, shit, shit.

57:07.424 --> 57:08.252
What?

57:10.979 --> 57:11.807
What?

57:12.670 --> 57:14.083
Fuck.

57:14.085 --> 57:14.983
Shit, shit,

57:16.260 --> 57:18.089
shit, shit, shit, ugh!

57:25.580 --> 57:26.443
What?

57:38.109 --> 57:39.488
Tada!

57:39.490 --> 57:40.731
Did you just break in?

57:40.733 --> 57:43.460
Uh, not exactly.

57:47.602 --> 57:49.017
Are you bleeding?

57:50.432 --> 57:53.297
Eh, not really,
come on, come in.

57:54.850 --> 57:55.679
Shit.

57:57.404 --> 57:59.991
No, I mean, I totally get it,

57:59.993 --> 58:03.512
my sister and I, we're just
very different, you know?

58:03.514 --> 58:06.135
I mean, she likes
to please my father

58:06.137 --> 58:10.866
and loves her conservative
way of life, and...

58:11.833 --> 58:13.764
I totally respect that.

58:15.008 --> 58:17.699
No, you don't.

58:17.701 --> 58:20.220
No, I don't, I'm an asshole.

58:21.221 --> 58:22.462
You know what?

58:22.464 --> 58:24.706
I actually think she
has a crush on James.

58:24.708 --> 58:25.743
Perfect timing.

58:26.951 --> 58:29.575
I mean, now that her
sister is a lesbian.

58:31.231 --> 58:32.714
Yeah.

58:32.716 --> 58:33.820
Good for her.

58:35.442 --> 58:39.136
No, I mean it, maybe
we should consider.

58:40.344 --> 58:42.378
I mean, I'm having a
great time with you,

58:42.380 --> 58:46.108
and you're having
fun with me, right?

58:47.800 --> 58:49.385
Always.

58:49.387 --> 58:50.216
See?

58:54.669 --> 58:55.566
So...

58:57.568 --> 59:00.327
should we, should we,
should we do this?

59:00.329 --> 59:01.917
Yeah, yeah, let's do it.

59:02.987 --> 59:03.816
Let's do it.

59:04.886 --> 59:05.988
- Let's do it.
- Oh, okay.

59:05.990 --> 59:06.819
Let's do it.

59:10.685 --> 59:11.617
You're very pretty.

59:12.618 --> 59:14.309
You're very pretty also.

59:15.310 --> 59:16.104
Thank you.

59:37.919 --> 59:39.297
- No.
- No, I'm sorry.

59:39.299 --> 59:41.645
I'm, yeah, I'm
definitely into guys.

59:47.963 --> 59:49.204
Being out
in the Hamptons seemed

59:49.206 --> 59:50.964
to make everything
so much easier.

59:50.966 --> 59:55.624
Lena swam in the cold water
for hours, clearing her head,

59:55.626 --> 59:58.767
while Maria was lying in the
hot sun thinking of nothing.

01:00:02.564 --> 01:00:05.047
Oh, it's cold.

01:00:05.049 --> 01:00:05.912
It's nice, no?

01:00:07.983 --> 01:00:09.880
Ugh, teenagers.

01:00:09.882 --> 01:00:11.191
I know.

01:00:11.193 --> 01:00:13.918
- I hate them.
- I get it.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.613
They always feel
so, invincible.

01:00:18.925 --> 01:00:20.200
"Remisuri"

01:00:20.202 --> 01:00:21.857
What?

01:00:21.859 --> 01:00:23.583
It's an old Bavarian word,

01:00:23.585 --> 01:00:25.723
meaning the
exuberance of children

01:00:25.725 --> 01:00:27.587
and the absence of parents.

01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:28.761
That's one word?

01:00:28.763 --> 01:00:30.383
Yeah, it's pretty
good, isn't it?

01:00:30.385 --> 01:00:31.800
Okay, remi...

01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:33.284
"Remisuri"

01:00:34.354 --> 01:00:35.146
"Suri" like the
daughter of Tom Cruise.

01:00:35.148 --> 01:00:36.078
Well, in that case,

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.494
I'm pretty "remisuri" myself.

01:00:38.496 --> 01:00:40.531
I think our whole
generation is.

01:00:40.533 --> 01:00:42.947
Yeah, you know,
when I was born,

01:00:42.949 --> 01:00:45.952
my mother named me Maria
after Maria Callas.

01:00:47.333 --> 01:00:48.297
No shit.

01:00:48.299 --> 01:00:50.506
Yeah, she actually did that.

01:00:50.508 --> 01:00:51.922
She used to say I was
the prettiest girl

01:00:51.924 --> 01:00:53.717
in the neighborhood.

01:00:53.719 --> 01:00:56.789
Once my mom told me my
beauty's a currency,

01:00:56.791 --> 01:00:59.654
and that I could actually
pay with my beauty.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:00.689
Wow.

01:01:00.691 --> 01:01:01.727
Yeah, she's amazing.

01:01:04.108 --> 01:01:08.835
When I was 14, there was
this boy that fancied me,

01:01:08.837 --> 01:01:10.526
and he followed me home.

01:01:10.528 --> 01:01:15.014
My mom was at work,
so, when we got in,

01:01:15.016 --> 01:01:18.465
he said I was the prettiest
girl he had ever seen.

01:01:18.467 --> 01:01:22.366
He was so nice, so I
gave him a blowjob.

01:01:22.368 --> 01:01:23.196
In the kitchen.

01:01:24.646 --> 01:01:28.579
My mom was pretty as well,
but she got knocked up.

01:01:28.581 --> 01:01:31.480
She was so proud of me when
I got that shitty soap opera.

01:01:32.999 --> 01:01:34.792
But I wanted to
be a real actress,

01:01:34.794 --> 01:01:37.935
I want to be a real actress,
that's why I came to New York.

01:01:39.143 --> 01:01:41.939
But now, karma fires back.

01:01:43.285 --> 01:01:47.738
Now, I have to give
blowjobs in audition rooms.

01:01:50.154 --> 01:01:51.984
God, I prefer the
one in my kitchen.

01:01:56.574 --> 01:02:00.369
You know, I was
pregnant last year.

01:02:00.371 --> 01:02:01.165
I lost it.

01:02:02.166 --> 01:02:03.685
Lena, I'm sorry.

01:02:06.205 --> 01:02:07.860
I don't even know if
I want to put children

01:02:07.862 --> 01:02:09.484
into this world anyway.

01:02:11.382 --> 01:02:12.659
I'm so sorry.

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:36.060
Oh man, you know
what your problem is?

01:02:36.062 --> 01:02:37.821
What is my problem?

01:02:37.823 --> 01:02:39.305
Tell me.

01:02:39.307 --> 01:02:41.479
You have to say that
you are an actress

01:02:41.481 --> 01:02:43.723
before you can be an actress.

01:02:43.725 --> 01:02:45.518
But, that's not true.

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.727
No, I mean, you have to say,

01:02:47.729 --> 01:02:51.627
"Hi, my name is Maria,
I'm an actress."

01:02:51.629 --> 01:02:54.492
But, that's not true, I...

01:02:54.494 --> 01:02:57.254
I've never been paid
for anything I've done,

01:02:57.256 --> 01:02:59.394
and I haven't worked
in such a long time.

01:02:59.396 --> 01:03:01.881
Oh come on,
money's so overrated.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:05.160
That's easy for you to say.

01:03:06.334 --> 01:03:09.576
But, I'm gonna tell
you a little secret.

01:03:09.578 --> 01:03:13.753
You actually need money
to survive in this world,

01:03:13.755 --> 01:03:16.894
like pay your rent...

01:03:16.896 --> 01:03:18.102
Really?

01:03:18.104 --> 01:03:20.346
And go shopping.

01:03:20.348 --> 01:03:23.349
Shocker, I kind of knew that.

01:03:23.351 --> 01:03:24.248
That's progress.

01:03:26.872 --> 01:03:29.426
No, I mean I'm serious,

01:03:30.634 --> 01:03:34.394
you can't have money
define who you are.

01:03:37.123 --> 01:03:39.434
I mean, listen to me,
you can't have money

01:03:39.436 --> 01:03:41.608
define who you are.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:43.440
'Cause money...

01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:47.269
Money makes you lazy.

01:03:47.271 --> 01:03:49.962
The whole fucking world
can crumble around you

01:03:49.964 --> 01:03:51.584
and you still don't make a move

01:03:51.586 --> 01:03:53.484
because of all your
comfortable money.

01:03:55.279 --> 01:03:56.108
It's like...

01:03:57.695 --> 01:03:59.111
It's like comfortable glue.

01:04:01.078 --> 01:04:01.907
Hm.

01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:06.428
I used to sniff glue
in kindergarten.

01:04:09.984 --> 01:04:11.537
Well, that explains a lot.

01:04:13.021 --> 01:04:15.884
Yeah, it probably does.

01:04:26.759 --> 01:04:27.829
I'm hungry.

01:04:42.119 --> 01:04:43.636
These are really good.

01:04:43.638 --> 01:04:45.743
- Mm-hm, more wine?
- Yes, please.

01:04:47.055 --> 01:04:49.471
- Another oyster?
- Yeah, thank you.

01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.818
Hey, did you see the
captain over there?

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.337
Yeah, nice hat.

01:04:55.339 --> 01:04:56.960
Do you think he's peacocking?

01:04:56.962 --> 01:04:59.548
Well, actually, I think
he might be old school.

01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:01.930
He might come over here
and pay for our lunch.

01:05:01.932 --> 01:05:03.414
Okay.

01:05:03.416 --> 01:05:05.004
Hi there, Captain,
how are you?

01:05:06.488 --> 01:05:08.974
Oh, well, hello.

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:12.253
Hi, you wanna join us?

01:05:13.564 --> 01:05:16.496
I'd love to, may
I buy you lunch?

01:05:16.498 --> 01:05:19.568
Oh, that would be
lovely, thank you.

01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:22.640
And maybe after lunch,
we could have a drink.

01:05:22.642 --> 01:05:24.642
On my boat.

01:05:24.644 --> 01:05:26.748
- Oh, you have a boat!
- Oh, you have a boat!

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:28.925
- Sure.
- Yeah, that would be great.

01:05:29.822 --> 01:05:31.030
Alright.

01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:42.904
Bubbly.

01:05:48.013 --> 01:05:48.875
Thank you.

01:05:50.739 --> 01:05:51.980
Thank you.

01:05:51.982 --> 01:05:55.397
- Top it off a little bit?
- Sure.

01:05:55.399 --> 01:05:56.228
Why not?

01:05:57.229 --> 01:05:58.057
Thanks.

01:06:04.753 --> 01:06:06.063
Cheers.

01:06:06.065 --> 01:06:07.547
Cheers.

01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:08.378
Cheers.

01:06:17.076 --> 01:06:18.834
Should I put on some music?

01:06:18.836 --> 01:06:21.149
You know, why don't
we just get naked?

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:27.811
Alright,

01:06:28.777 --> 01:06:30.434
- yeah.
- Yeah.

01:06:44.655 --> 01:06:45.449
Wow.

01:06:46.623 --> 01:06:48.381
Wow.

01:06:48.383 --> 01:06:49.589
Nice.

01:07:05.711 --> 01:07:06.505
Close your eyes.

01:07:11.096 --> 01:07:11.924
Mm.

01:07:13.063 --> 01:07:16.789
Keep your eyes closed,
count from 10 to one

01:07:16.791 --> 01:07:20.415
and imagine your wildest
dreams coming true.

01:07:21.968 --> 01:07:22.797
Mm.

01:07:24.316 --> 01:07:25.144
10,

01:07:27.457 --> 01:07:28.285
nine...

01:07:31.116 --> 01:07:31.978
Seven...

01:07:33.325 --> 01:07:34.634
Sex...

01:07:34.636 --> 01:07:37.706
Uh, I mean six.

01:07:37.708 --> 01:07:39.607
Five, four...

01:07:42.989 --> 01:07:44.541
Hey, hey!

01:07:44.543 --> 01:07:45.956
My hat!

01:07:45.958 --> 01:07:48.271
Where are you going?

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:55.209
Hey!

01:07:56.624 --> 01:07:57.452
My hat!

01:08:21.718 --> 01:08:22.957
Lena,

01:08:25.341 --> 01:08:27.135
Please, come home now.

01:08:30.761 --> 01:08:33.831
I know you don't wanna
talk to me but just...

01:08:38.252 --> 01:08:39.115
Please, come home

01:08:45.397 --> 01:08:47.189
After the
episode with the captain,

01:08:47.192 --> 01:08:48.432
Lena developed an inkling

01:08:48.434 --> 01:08:50.502
that their forlornness
was coming to and end.

01:08:50.505 --> 01:08:52.988
She realized that
nothing had changed

01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:55.232
and that she didn't
want change after all.

01:08:55.234 --> 01:08:58.166
Meanwhile, Maria
was absorbing nature

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:00.513
and nature seemed to absorb her.

01:09:00.515 --> 01:09:03.033
Life had always felt like
an abundance of opportunity,

01:09:03.035 --> 01:09:04.759
too overwhelming
to make a choice.

01:09:04.761 --> 01:09:07.935
Now, nothing seemed
to matter anymore.

01:09:11.388 --> 01:09:14.319
The wide space made Lena
feel small and insignificant.

01:09:14.322 --> 01:09:16.667
She longed for the city
where everything had a system

01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:17.808
and she knew her place.

01:09:18.982 --> 01:09:21.879
Maria, however, felt
at ease with herself.

01:09:21.881 --> 01:09:24.434
She felt like a part
of something bigger.

01:09:24.435 --> 01:09:26.712
And for the first
time in a long while,

01:09:26.714 --> 01:09:28.334
she was happy and hopeful.

01:09:54.845 --> 01:09:55.915
Don't look.

01:09:58.263 --> 01:09:59.227
Don't look.

01:09:59.229 --> 01:10:00.539
No, I'm not looking.

01:10:00.541 --> 01:10:01.816
Don't look, no cheating.

01:10:02.888 --> 01:10:04.681
Don't look.

01:10:04.683 --> 01:10:06.303
Okay, here we go, here we go,

01:10:06.305 --> 01:10:09.168
- just one more step.
- Alright, here?

01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:11.377
There you go, and tada!

01:10:11.379 --> 01:10:12.930
You made fire!

01:10:12.932 --> 01:10:14.967
- I made fire!
- Wow!

01:10:14.969 --> 01:10:16.002
But that's not why we're here.

01:10:16.004 --> 01:10:18.557
- Why?
- We are here to do

01:10:18.559 --> 01:10:20.492
a little burning ritual

01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:23.357
so you can free yourself.

01:10:25.082 --> 01:10:26.634
Okay, you ready?

01:10:26.636 --> 01:10:29.844
One, two, three.

01:10:29.846 --> 01:10:31.054
Yay!

01:10:33.712 --> 01:10:36.160
Okay, so free yourself, come on.

01:10:36.162 --> 01:10:38.128
Burn it, burn it,

01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:39.647
burn it, burn it, burn it,

01:10:39.649 --> 01:10:43.098
you have to free yourself,
free yourself, come on!

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:46.205
Burn it, burn it,
burn it, burn it!

01:10:46.207 --> 01:10:49.210
Do it, do it, burn it, burn it!

01:10:50.315 --> 01:10:51.626
Yay!

01:10:53.801 --> 01:10:55.732
Okay, there's more, okay.

01:11:00.152 --> 01:11:01.082
No, stop, stop!

01:11:01.084 --> 01:11:02.497
- One, two...
- Stop!

01:11:02.499 --> 01:11:03.328
What?

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:07.849
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:11:09.195 --> 01:11:10.438
What's wrong with you?

01:11:11.508 --> 01:11:13.163
He never cheated on me.

01:11:13.165 --> 01:11:13.993
What?

01:11:15.478 --> 01:11:17.065
He never cheated on me, okay?

01:11:18.343 --> 01:11:19.171
I made it up.

01:11:20.621 --> 01:11:23.762
He never has, he never will
be, it's just not who he is.

01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:29.354
Why would you do that?

01:11:31.356 --> 01:11:32.598
I don't know.

01:11:35.498 --> 01:11:37.256
You don't know.

01:11:37.258 --> 01:11:38.121
I know why.

01:11:39.778 --> 01:11:41.676
Because you're so
fucking ungrateful.

01:11:43.091 --> 01:11:45.818
You just like to play around
with people's feelings.

01:11:47.268 --> 01:11:50.304
You're so wise and you know
everything, you have everything.

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:52.927
I fucking quit my
job because of you!

01:11:52.929 --> 01:11:56.931
Oh, don't put this on
me, you hated your job!

01:11:56.933 --> 01:11:58.657
What a dreamer you are.

01:11:58.659 --> 01:12:01.729
Always dream big and
then you get cold feet.

01:12:01.731 --> 01:12:02.663
What a rebel.

01:12:03.767 --> 01:12:05.595
You can never
commit to anything.

01:12:05.597 --> 01:12:08.358
Always on your fucking
phone, always withdrawn.

01:12:11.050 --> 01:12:12.051
You're so afraid.

01:12:13.052 --> 01:12:14.364
No, actually worse...

01:12:15.469 --> 01:12:16.746
You're a coward.

01:12:18.057 --> 01:12:18.886
I'm a coward?

01:12:20.474 --> 01:12:22.646
You're worse, you know why?

01:12:22.648 --> 01:12:24.061
Because you destroy everything,

01:12:24.063 --> 01:12:26.961
you just like to destroy
everything because you're bored.

01:12:26.963 --> 01:12:29.135
You have everything, you
have the perfect life,

01:12:29.137 --> 01:12:30.965
the perfect husband,
the perfect marriage!

01:12:30.967 --> 01:12:32.932
You don't even know what
you're talking about, okay?

01:12:32.934 --> 01:12:34.073
You're just jealous.

01:12:36.455 --> 01:12:38.455
You wanna know how I feel?

01:12:38.457 --> 01:12:40.148
You wanna know
how I really feel?

01:12:42.496 --> 01:12:43.497
Fucking lost.

01:12:44.981 --> 01:12:48.879
Lost in this apartment, in
my marriage, in this world

01:12:48.881 --> 01:12:52.814
where people are killing each
other for religion, whatever.

01:12:52.816 --> 01:12:54.333
And all of my shit?

01:12:54.335 --> 01:12:56.508
I can't do anything with it.

01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:57.612
Can I be a mother?

01:12:57.614 --> 01:12:59.545
No. Can I make a difference?

01:12:59.547 --> 01:13:00.960
No. And it doesn't even matter

01:13:00.962 --> 01:13:02.514
because people will
still kill each other

01:13:02.516 --> 01:13:05.208
and starve, and drown in oceans.

01:13:06.451 --> 01:13:07.624
And you know what?

01:13:08.591 --> 01:13:09.764
No one,

01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:14.804
no one expects
anything of me anyway.

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:20.775
So, it's all about you again.

01:13:22.536 --> 01:13:24.192
You are such an asshole.

01:13:25.297 --> 01:13:29.264
You really are a
fucking spoiled bitch.

01:13:36.619 --> 01:13:38.068
- Fuck you.
- Maria,

01:13:40.346 --> 01:13:41.175
Maria!

01:14:10.273 --> 01:14:12.998
Maria was
upset and confused.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.761
She couldn't believe
how naive she had been.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:21.249
At the same time, she felt
a strange sense of relief.

01:14:28.291 --> 01:14:29.635
Lena had the feeling
that this week

01:14:29.637 --> 01:14:31.432
actually had helped
them after all.

01:14:32.606 --> 01:14:34.847
That they had found
something together.

01:14:34.849 --> 01:14:38.679
A possibility of honesty,
a chance to accept.

01:14:38.681 --> 01:14:41.198
She was wondering
if Maria would agree

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.477
and forgive her after all.

01:14:53.834 --> 01:14:56.559
Maybe, if she explained
herself one more time.

01:15:19.655 --> 01:15:24.655
