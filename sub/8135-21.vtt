WEBVTT

00:02.735 --> 00:06.035
- There's nobody driving that... Did you see that?
- Hold it together, okay, Armand?

00:06.106 --> 00:10.042
Whoever is stealing your software
is doing it from the inside.

00:10.110 --> 00:13.705
There's this strange woman. She's following
me around. She's even taking pictures of me.

00:15.115 --> 00:18.551
Julian is a devious little worm.
I wouldn't put anything past him.

00:18.618 --> 00:22.349
He may have been fooling around
with her, but he didn't kill her.

00:22.422 --> 00:26.290
Now, there's one road out of this dump, and if
I see either one of you on it, the lady dies.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.691
Let's get him, buddy!
Yeah!

00:41.708 --> 00:46.805
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:46.880 --> 00:48.905
who does not exist.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.950
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.028 --> 01:04.553
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.631 --> 01:07.657
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:07.734 --> 01:11.295
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

04:16.389 --> 04:18.289
Freeze!

04:21.928 --> 04:23.828
Come in.

04:28.201 --> 04:32.797
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Stevens. We
caught this guy prowling around Sector "A."

04:32.872 --> 04:34.999
- Good work.
- Should I call the police?

04:35.074 --> 04:37.634
No.

04:37.710 --> 04:41.612
I'll take care of it from here.
Thank you.

04:41.681 --> 04:44.844
You're welcome.
Good night, Mr. Stevens.

04:56.029 --> 04:59.487
Good evening, Michael. I'd like you to
meet the president of Delton Micronics.

04:59.565 --> 05:01.430
Elliot Stevens, Michael Knight.

05:01.501 --> 05:04.026
Mr. Stevens.
Where'd they catch you?

05:04.103 --> 05:07.129
Outside the programming room. You
mean even without KITT's assistance,

05:07.206 --> 05:09.800
you managed to penetrate
the outer security perimeter?

05:09.876 --> 05:11.810
Only because
I've been well trained, Devon.

05:11.878 --> 05:16.008
But once I got right about here,
it was all over.

05:16.082 --> 05:20.018
- There was no way you could enter the programming room?
- No, not without the access code.

05:20.086 --> 05:25.251
Mr. Stevens, whoever is stealing your software
is doing it from the inside.

05:28.661 --> 05:32.028
I was afraid of that.

05:32.098 --> 05:36.558
You know, sometimes I wish I still
ran this company out of my garage.

05:36.636 --> 05:39.901
I'm just not prepared to deal
with industrial espionage.

05:39.972 --> 05:41.735
Fortunately, the Foundation is.

05:41.808 --> 05:45.676
Mr. Stevens, how many of your employees
have access to the programming room?

05:45.745 --> 05:49.841
Myself and four others. But I can't believe
any one of them would steal our prototypes.

05:49.916 --> 05:53.352
Why not? Computer software
is a "boom or bust" industry.

05:53.419 --> 05:56.013
I mean, one lucky strike,
and you're an instant millionaire.

05:56.089 --> 05:59.490
- You're living proof of that, Elliot.
- And look what I got to show for it...

05:59.559 --> 06:02.995
an ulcer and a new set of corporate types
who demand more and more profits.

06:03.062 --> 06:05.257
All I ever wanted to do
was design video games.

06:05.331 --> 06:09.131
It still baffles me that
they've become so popular.

06:19.345 --> 06:22.542
Sorry, Bonnie.
Would you care to try again?

06:22.615 --> 06:25.743
No, thank you, KITT.
You know how low my resistance is.

06:25.818 --> 06:27.877
I don't want to get hooked
on Space Cadet.

06:27.954 --> 06:32.050
Whatever you say, Bonnie. However, I'd like
to point out that this is a game of skill,

06:32.125 --> 06:34.787
designed not only to challenge
one's hand-eye coordination,

06:34.861 --> 06:37.489
but to stimulate
strategic thinking as well.

06:37.563 --> 06:41.294
As long as you put it that way,
one more quick one.

06:41.367 --> 06:43.358
If you say so.

07:05.792 --> 07:08.659
Hello, Bonnie.
How are you doing with KITT?

07:08.728 --> 07:11.595
Fine.

07:11.664 --> 07:15.361
His data banks are overflowing with everything
you ever wanted to know on Delton Micronics...

07:15.435 --> 07:17.403
personnel files,
business reports,

07:17.470 --> 07:20.530
stockholders, leading competitors,

07:20.606 --> 07:22.972
not to mention
their entire line of video games.

07:23.042 --> 07:27.103
Video games? Which one are
you playing? Space Cadet.

07:27.180 --> 07:30.547
- Care to play, Michael?
- Hey, Devon, wanna play?

07:30.616 --> 07:34.313
See if you can beat me? Michael, I have no
intention of engaging in a game of Space Cadet.

07:34.387 --> 07:38.483
- Why not?
- Because I fail to understand the attraction of such a frivolous pastime.

07:38.558 --> 07:41.959
I'll bet your mother used to tell you the
same thing when you'd run off and play cricket.

07:42.028 --> 07:46.124
Cricket, frivolous?
Actually, it was my nanny.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.167
And I happened to be
in kindergarten at the time.

07:49.235 --> 07:52.068
You're never too old for video games.

07:54.574 --> 07:56.838
- Sorry, Michael.
- Aah!

07:56.909 --> 07:59.810
You oughta try it sometime.
You'll like it. Catch you later.

08:26.005 --> 08:31.068
KITT, give me a rundown on the four
suspects, will ya? Certainly, Michael.

08:35.914 --> 08:39.043
Each of the individuals possesses
a degree in computer science...

08:39.118 --> 08:42.815
and is considered
a top man in the profession.

08:42.889 --> 08:46.518
The two men pictured have been close friends
of Elliot Stevens since college...

08:46.592 --> 08:48.890
and would seem highly unlikely
to betray him.

08:48.961 --> 08:50.929
What about the other two?

08:50.997 --> 08:53.830
Unfortunately,
the personal data I've compiled...

08:53.900 --> 08:57.097
sheds no light whatsoever
on their potential for criminal behavior.

08:57.169 --> 09:00.366
- In other words, you're stumped.
- Perhaps if I did some cross-referencing.

09:00.439 --> 09:03.101
KITT, isn't there any information
in the files,

09:03.175 --> 09:05.234
anything at all,
that's out of the ordinary?

09:05.311 --> 09:07.506
I'm not sure if this fits
into that category,

09:07.580 --> 09:10.549
but one of the suspects
maintains two local addresses.

09:10.616 --> 09:14.245
- Who's that?
- Julian Groves.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.720
Uh, great.
Let me see your moves. Great.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.352
Wonderful.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.463
Great.

09:25.531 --> 09:27.624
All right. Far out.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.930
Get down.

09:30.002 --> 09:31.401
Great.

09:34.340 --> 09:36.399
- You done?
- Huh?

09:36.475 --> 09:38.409
Oh, yeah.
Hey, listen, thanks a lot.

09:38.477 --> 09:41.446
You want me to send you a couple copies
from Des Moines? Don't they skate out there?

09:41.514 --> 09:43.141
No, we're still into hula hoops.

10:44.610 --> 10:47.170
You sure this is the place?
According to my data,

10:47.246 --> 10:50.511
Julian has a court reserved
for this time every Wednesday morning.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.483
"Hillsdale Tennis Club."

10:52.551 --> 10:56.510
Well, we gotta start somewhere.
Might as well be here.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.828
Hi. That fresh?

11:08.901 --> 11:10.835
Squeezed it myself.
How about a double?

11:10.903 --> 11:13.565
Coming right up.

11:20.279 --> 11:23.214
Whoo! She's really putting on
a show out there.

11:23.282 --> 11:26.581
What'd you say?
I was just checking out that, uh...

11:26.652 --> 11:28.711
Oh, that's Connie Chasen.

11:28.788 --> 11:31.382
She's one of our instructors.
No kidding?

11:31.457 --> 11:34.620
What do you want, more money?

11:34.694 --> 11:39.097
Look, the money has nothing to do with it.
You can have all the money back.

11:39.165 --> 11:41.690
I just want out.

11:44.170 --> 11:46.604
I'm afraid it's not that easy, Julian.

11:48.574 --> 11:50.804
The fact is you're an industrial spy,

11:50.876 --> 11:54.937
and since that fact is so easy to
bring to the attention of the police...

11:55.014 --> 11:57.039
Wait. You wouldn't do that.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.448
I wouldn't want to, Julian.

11:59.518 --> 12:03.921
All I want is you to bring me
the last program you promised me.

12:03.989 --> 12:05.923
Wait a minute!

12:05.991 --> 12:09.256
Wait a minute. You don't understand.
There's this, uh...

12:09.328 --> 12:12.297
There's this strange woman.
She's following me around.

12:12.364 --> 12:14.889
She's even taking pictures of me.

12:14.967 --> 12:17.595
You're letting the pressure get to you.

12:17.670 --> 12:20.969
No one's after you.
You don't have a thing to worry about.

12:33.719 --> 12:36.415
I took the liberty of bringing you a refill.

12:36.489 --> 12:40.721
That wasn't necessary. No, but it gave
me a great excuse to come over here.

12:40.793 --> 12:43.261
Hi. I'm Michael Knight.
You play?

12:43.329 --> 12:45.524
What?

12:45.598 --> 12:50.501
Tennis? Oh. No.
I was thinking about taking lessons.

12:50.569 --> 12:53.299
You're not a member here?
Not exactly.

12:53.372 --> 12:55.932
Come on.
I'll buy you a celery tonic.

12:56.008 --> 12:59.842
You know her? She's an instructor here.
You might talk to her.

12:59.912 --> 13:02.073
Celery tonic.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.742
Yeah, same thing.

13:04.817 --> 13:07.183
You should take it easy.

13:10.589 --> 13:12.523
There she is!

13:12.591 --> 13:16.357
There who is?
The girl that's been tailing me.

13:16.428 --> 13:18.828
I gotta get out of here.
Julian!

13:18.898 --> 13:20.889
Excuse me.

13:30.509 --> 13:33.603
Michael, Julian just left.
He seemed to be in quite a hurry.

13:33.679 --> 13:36.580
I know.

13:36.649 --> 13:40.141
Let's find out why.
You got it, pal.

13:44.957 --> 13:47.551
What did you learn about Julian?

13:47.626 --> 13:49.560
Two things, KITT.

13:49.628 --> 13:52.461
He's a lousy tennis player,

13:52.531 --> 13:54.897
and we're not the only ones
interested in him.

13:54.967 --> 13:58.334
Michael, would the other interested party
happen to be an attractive brunette?

13:58.404 --> 14:02.704
Good guess, KITT. She's been following
us since we left the tennis club.

14:05.778 --> 14:07.712
Michael, why are we slowing down?

14:07.780 --> 14:11.773
I don't want to lose her.
Not yet anyway.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.081
- What about Julian?
- Keep him on the tracking scope.

14:14.153 --> 14:18.283
We'll get back to him later.
Meanwhile, let's find a cozy corner...

14:18.357 --> 14:21.952
where we can have a little talk
with our curious lady friend, huh?

15:30.629 --> 15:32.620
All right, lady, out.

15:38.404 --> 15:42.101
- Hold it right there, mister, and put your hands up.
- Who are you?

15:42.174 --> 15:44.199
I got the gun.
I get to ask the questions.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.870
Oh. Is that the way it works?

15:46.946 --> 15:50.177
You never, ever point a gun at somebody
unless you intend to use it.

15:50.249 --> 15:54.583
Now, you got that? I think it's time
we had a real serious discussion here.

15:58.490 --> 16:01.118
Oh, Officer, thank God you're here!
You just saved my life!

16:01.193 --> 16:04.162
This man pulled me over, dragged me
from the car, was about to assault me.

16:04.229 --> 16:06.697
- Assault you?
- Be careful, Officer. I think he's dangerous.

16:06.765 --> 16:10.531
- Okay, pal, turn around and assume the position.
- Now, wait a minute.

16:10.602 --> 16:12.593
Hands on your head.

16:17.509 --> 16:19.443
Oh, my gosh! He had a gun!

16:19.511 --> 16:22.173
Officer, that's not my gun.
Never is.

16:22.247 --> 16:25.683
Now, who says there's never
a cop around when you need one?

16:50.743 --> 16:53.541
Michael, I'm glad you're back.
So am I.

16:53.612 --> 16:58.481
I don't like jails.
I don't like police impounds.

17:11.329 --> 17:13.388
KITT, you run a check
on that license plate?

17:13.464 --> 17:15.490
If you're referring
to the attractive brunette,

17:15.567 --> 17:18.229
the car is registered
under the name of Flannery Roe.

17:18.303 --> 17:21.396
Address?
2818 Euclid Avenue.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.599
I take it that's
our immediate destination.

17:25.344 --> 17:27.436
You got that right.

17:41.093 --> 17:44.927
Here we are, Michael.
Okay, sit tight.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.917
Flannery?

18:57.402 --> 18:59.336
Connie Chasen?

19:13.785 --> 19:16.015
Hello?

19:16.088 --> 19:19.649
Hello, Julian? I just called to
say that I'm free tonight. Tonight?

19:19.725 --> 19:21.352
Isn't that a little premature?

19:21.426 --> 19:23.587
I really want to see you, Julian.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.222
Um, can't it wait
till the end of the week?

19:26.298 --> 19:29.165
No, something's happened.
It has to be tonight.

19:29.234 --> 19:32.101
Um, Connie,
I don't think this is a good idea.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.538
- What about that girl that...
- Julian, would you stop worrying so much?

19:35.607 --> 19:37.541
Now, what time
do you get through with work?

19:37.609 --> 19:40.043
Eight.
But, Connie...

19:40.112 --> 19:42.910
Perfect. I'll meet you
at your place at 8:30.

19:42.981 --> 19:44.915
Don't disappoint me, Julian.

19:52.658 --> 19:54.592
Michael? Michael?

20:08.640 --> 20:11.131
- KITT, you there?
- Michael, what happened?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.542
- Are you all right?
- No. Yeah, I'm fine.

20:13.612 --> 20:17.446
Listen, get on the phone to Devon. Tell
him I need some background information...

20:17.516 --> 20:19.541
on one Connie Chasen.

20:19.618 --> 20:22.815
- She's an instructor at the tennis club.
- I'll relay the message at once.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.685
Thanks.

20:41.773 --> 20:44.367
Hello, Flannery.
Mr. Knight.

20:44.443 --> 20:46.638
I had a feeling
our paths would cross again.

20:46.712 --> 20:50.512
Cross is not the word. You don't happen
to have some very large associate...

20:50.582 --> 20:53.517
Don't let me interrupt you. Why don't
you just trash the rest of the place?

20:53.585 --> 20:57.112
As much as I'd like to even the score here,
this is not my handiwork.

20:57.189 --> 21:01.819
Oh, I see. Well, if you didn't come
to loot and plunder, what brings you here?

21:01.893 --> 21:04.691
I wanna find out what
your connection is with Julian Groves.

21:04.763 --> 21:08.290
I don't know any Julian Groves. Come on.
I know you were hired to tail the man.

21:08.367 --> 21:11.268
I just wanna find out why.

21:11.336 --> 21:14.669
That is privileged information,
Mr. Knight.

21:14.740 --> 21:18.642
If I was to tell you anything, I would be violating
the confidential relationship with my client.

21:18.710 --> 21:20.610
All right, let me give you
a piece of advice here.

21:20.679 --> 21:25.013
Just lay off Julian Groves.
Now, that sounds more like an order to me.

21:25.083 --> 21:27.950
Well, maybe it is an order,
but just stay out of my way, all right?

21:28.020 --> 21:31.456
- Want me to stay out of your way? Stay out of my office.
- You're in over your head here.

21:31.523 --> 21:36.153
If you're not real careful,
you're gonna drown.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.306
Hello? Hello, Mrs.
Groves? It's Flannery Roe.

21:54.379 --> 21:56.313
Oh, hello, Flannery.
How's it going?

21:56.381 --> 22:00.681
Well, except for a few minor setbacks,
it looks like tonight's gonna be the clincher.

22:00.752 --> 22:03.983
- What do you mean?
- They're getting together at Julian's apartment.

22:05.223 --> 22:08.818
I see. Look, I know this isn't
easy for you, but in the long run...

22:08.894 --> 22:10.953
you're gonna be glad you hired me.

22:11.029 --> 22:15.523
Now, look, I'll call you first thing in the morning and
we'll set a time to get together and discuss the next step.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.569
Okay, whatever you say.

22:18.637 --> 22:21.197
Good-bye, Flannery.
Bye-bye.

22:23.575 --> 22:26.271
Well, your friend Miss Chasen
has, shall we say,

22:26.345 --> 22:28.404
a rather colorful background.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.448
Not only is she a gifted athlete,

22:30.515 --> 22:34.576
she was formerly one of
the top fashion models in New York.

22:34.653 --> 22:37.952
Where, according to society pages,
she was romantically involved...

22:38.023 --> 22:40.014
with some of the wealthiest men
on the East Coast.

22:40.092 --> 22:42.287
What's she been doing lately?

22:42.361 --> 22:44.886
Well, she's been keeping
a rather low profile.

22:44.963 --> 22:47.625
Apart from her job at the tennis club,

22:47.699 --> 22:50.793
she's been playing bit parts
in several unremarkable movies.

22:50.869 --> 22:54.464
So we're talking about a very ambitious
and very attractive young lady.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.770
- I'd say so.
- Then what's she doing with Julian Groves?

23:02.614 --> 23:05.742
As I understand it, Michael,
you think Connie's been using Julian.

23:05.817 --> 23:09.116
Let's just say it's more than a hunch
and less than a certainty, pal.

23:09.187 --> 23:13.248
But we have no proof. Hey, how
about a little patience, huh?

23:22.534 --> 23:25.992
- Does that sound like business or pleasure?
- You got me, pal.

23:50.829 --> 23:52.763
Julian, where the hell are you?

23:52.831 --> 23:56.358
- How did you know it was me?
- I'm psychic. Did you get what I asked for?

23:56.435 --> 23:58.369
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.997
Look, I don't think I'm gonna be able
to get it out of here.

24:01.072 --> 24:03.939
What do you mean? There's a party
here for some of the secretaries.

24:04.009 --> 24:08.639
- There's dozens of people around. I just don't think...
- Julian, listen to me.

24:08.713 --> 24:10.340
It doesn't make...
Relax.

24:10.415 --> 24:13.714
Take a deep breath. Count to ten.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.913
You're gonna be fine.

24:19.524 --> 24:22.925
Now, isn't that better?

24:22.994 --> 24:25.121
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
I can't tell.

24:25.197 --> 24:28.030
Good. Now just walk out
like everything's normal.

24:28.099 --> 24:30.033
Nobody will notice you.

24:32.737 --> 24:36.798
Okay. Okay, I'll, uh,
see you in 15 minutes.

24:36.875 --> 24:38.934
Great.

24:47.252 --> 24:49.652
Okay, KITT, give it your best shot.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.893
Whoa-ho!

24:55.961 --> 24:58.828
Looks like Julian had
his hand in the cookie jar again, huh?

24:58.897 --> 25:01.365
Just as you suspected.
Shall we apprehend him?

25:01.433 --> 25:03.924
No, not yet.
Julian's only half the equation.

25:04.002 --> 25:07.836
Now we follow what's inside that briefcase.
Lock him in on the tracking scope.

25:23.355 --> 25:27.121
- What's he doing?
- As far as I can tell, he's hyperventilating.

25:41.473 --> 25:43.839
Here we go, KITT.

25:51.816 --> 25:55.217
Michael, it looks like he's
heading for home. Thanks, pal.

26:43.902 --> 26:46.496
Do you see what I see?
Afraid so, KITT.

26:46.571 --> 26:48.562
It's Flannery.

27:19.137 --> 27:21.128
Thank you.

27:25.343 --> 27:28.107
Flannery, maybe you should
eat something, huh?

27:28.179 --> 27:31.148
No, thanks. This is about all
my stomach can handle right now.

27:34.419 --> 27:37.820
You just had
a pretty strong dose of reality.

27:37.889 --> 27:40.756
It'll take you a while to shake it off.

27:40.825 --> 27:43.658
It was my first murder, that's all.

27:43.728 --> 27:46.492
They say once you get the first one
under your belt, it hardens you.

27:46.564 --> 27:49.761
No, that's not true.
You never get used to it.

27:49.834 --> 27:53.270
Are you some kind of expert?

27:53.338 --> 27:56.330
Not really.
Look.

27:56.408 --> 27:59.036
Michael, you don't have to stay here
and hold my hand.

27:59.110 --> 28:02.238
Flannery, did it ever occur to you that...

28:02.313 --> 28:04.281
you might not be cut out
for this kind of business?

28:04.349 --> 28:09.844
No! And why would
you even ask me that question?

28:09.921 --> 28:11.855
Because I'm a woman?

28:11.923 --> 28:14.483
Because without the support of
a big, strong man, I'd fall to pieces?

28:14.559 --> 28:16.686
No, that's not what I meant.
Oh, sure.

28:16.761 --> 28:19.491
This whole thing is Julian's fault,
not mine.

28:19.564 --> 28:22.032
If he wasn't cheating on his wife,
none of this would have happened.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.897
Julian wasn't cheating on his wife.

28:23.968 --> 28:28.098
That's your opinion.
I happen to believe otherwise.

28:28.173 --> 28:33.236
Julian is a devious little worm. I wouldn't
put anything past him, including murder.

28:33.311 --> 28:36.007
Is that what you're gonna tell his wife?

28:36.081 --> 28:38.072
She hired me to learn the truth.

28:38.149 --> 28:41.118
We don't even know the truth yet...
Not all of it.

28:41.186 --> 28:44.952
I thought you weren't an expert.

28:45.023 --> 28:47.355
You want a ride home?
No, thank you.

28:47.425 --> 28:51.953
Despite what you may think, I am
perfectly capable of taking care of myself.

28:52.030 --> 28:55.727
I hope so.
I really do.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.931
The police want Julian in for questioning.

29:04.008 --> 29:05.976
Devon, I'm telling you.
Julian didn't do it.

29:06.044 --> 29:09.309
Your intuition notwithstanding,
he's the number one suspect.

29:09.380 --> 29:12.110
He may be a thief,
but Julian Groves is no murderer.

29:12.183 --> 29:16.779
Well, unfortunately, he's not around to
proclaim his innocence. What do you expect?

29:16.855 --> 29:19.187
Put yourself in his shoes.

29:19.257 --> 29:23.489
He goes to his room to meet Connie.
He finds her dead. Would you hang around?

29:23.561 --> 29:28.362
Especially if you got a briefcase worth
a million bucks? That's pure speculation.

29:28.433 --> 29:32.460
What's Julian's motive?
What could he possibly gain by killing her?

29:39.444 --> 29:42.641
Yes? Show him in.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.377
We've lost it.

29:47.452 --> 29:50.512
The source code for our hottest new game
disappeared last night.

29:50.588 --> 29:54.422
- We know.
- You told me you had reason to believe that Julian was the thief.

29:54.492 --> 29:57.154
All you had to do was nab him,
and we'd still have the program.

29:57.228 --> 30:00.664
We wanted to find out who was buying
as well as who was selling your secrets.

30:00.732 --> 30:05.101
The only time I try to kill
two birds with one stone...

30:05.170 --> 30:08.333
is when I know for damn sure
they're not gonna fly away.

30:10.608 --> 30:13.406
Julian's a fugitive now.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.343
He certainly won't be
coming back to work.

30:15.413 --> 30:18.473
So at least we've eliminated
the espionage problems.

30:18.550 --> 30:21.212
The point is, who was Julian
selling the programs to?

30:21.286 --> 30:24.050
There are so many new companies.
Your guess is as good as mine.

30:24.122 --> 30:26.522
We're not in the guessing business,
Mr. Stevens.

30:26.591 --> 30:30.493
- You might as well be.
- I believe we have nothing further to talk about.

30:33.598 --> 30:37.557
You're right.
I've gotta start working...

30:37.635 --> 30:40.832
on some excuses
for my board of directors.

30:40.905 --> 30:42.839
I'll see you around.

30:47.212 --> 30:49.544
Michael.
Michael, where are you going?

30:49.614 --> 30:54.017
There may not be anything else to talk about,
but I'm gonna go get some questions answered.

31:31.689 --> 31:35.216
- How you doing?
- You're the orange juice, right?

31:35.293 --> 31:39.525
Good memory.
I'm sorry about that instructor.

31:39.597 --> 31:43.294
I read it in the newspapers this morning.
It's a hell of a way to go.

31:43.368 --> 31:46.132
- Yeah.
- Did you know her well?

31:46.204 --> 31:47.762
What do you mean?

31:47.839 --> 31:52.173
Well, from what I read between the lines,
she liked to live in the fast lane.

31:52.243 --> 31:55.576
Hey, who cares, huh?
The lady's dead.

31:55.647 --> 31:57.581
There's no sense
dragging her name through the mud.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.184
I'm sorry.

32:05.089 --> 32:07.148
Flannery, what are you doing here?

32:07.225 --> 32:10.126
That's none of your business. Yeah,
well, I'm gonna make it my business.

32:17.168 --> 32:20.331
I thought you learned something
about yourself last night.

32:20.405 --> 32:24.637
What I learned was that the tough don't have
to get going just 'cause the going gets tough.

32:24.709 --> 32:27.303
Flannery, one person is dead here.

32:27.378 --> 32:31.041
Don't try to scare me, Michael. All I'm
trying to do is keep you from getting hurt.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.811
Thanks, but danger is my business.

32:33.885 --> 32:36.786
Will you stop playing junior private eye
for a minute and listen to me?

32:39.057 --> 32:43.153
In spite of all your snooping around here,
you got no idea what's going on.

32:43.227 --> 32:46.492
Julian and Connie
have a business relationship.

32:46.564 --> 32:48.725
She was his middleman,
not his mistress.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.234
Why do you insist on protecting Julian?

32:51.302 --> 32:53.827
Because I don't believe he's a murderer.
You're crazy.

32:53.905 --> 32:57.864
Okay, I'm crazy. Do you have any
idea where I might find Julian?

32:57.942 --> 33:01.639
If I did, why should I tell you?
This is my case.

33:01.713 --> 33:05.649
Yeah, well,
you have it your way.

33:10.421 --> 33:13.288
Michael, what makes you think
Julian's wife will cooperate?

33:13.358 --> 33:16.191
I'm an eternal optimist, KITT.

33:33.578 --> 33:37.947
Mrs. Groves?
I'm Michael Knight.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.041
I already told the police
everything I know.

33:40.118 --> 33:42.382
Wait. I'm not with the police department.

33:42.453 --> 33:44.478
One of the papers?
No, I'm a friend.

33:44.555 --> 33:46.489
Yeah, well, if you're a friend,
then you'll go away.

33:46.557 --> 33:48.582
It's very important that
I find your husband.

33:48.659 --> 33:51.287
Well, I wish I could help you,

33:51.362 --> 33:54.058
but I haven't spoken to Julian
in weeks.

33:54.132 --> 33:59.593
He could be in...
Afghanistan for all I know or care.

33:59.670 --> 34:03.572
No, that's not true.
That he's not in Afghanistan?

34:03.641 --> 34:06.474
No. That you don't care.

34:07.912 --> 34:10.813
Okay. I care.

34:13.016 --> 34:16.976
I know that Julian's in a lot of trouble,

34:17.054 --> 34:20.456
but honest to God,
I don't know where he is.

34:23.661 --> 34:27.893
But I do know that
he couldn't have killed that girl.

34:27.965 --> 34:31.799
He may have been
fooling around with her,

34:31.869 --> 34:33.803
but he didn't kill her.

34:33.871 --> 34:36.737
He wasn't fooling around with
her either. How do you know?

34:37.942 --> 34:40.409
Can I come in?
Yeah.

34:40.478 --> 34:43.469
Mrs. Groves,

34:43.547 --> 34:45.572
your husband wasn't fooling around
with Connie Chasen.

34:45.650 --> 34:50.882
Your husband was stealing
computer programs from Delton Micronics.

34:50.955 --> 34:53.924
Connie Chasen was just
taking them off his hands.

34:53.991 --> 34:56.016
You mean he wasn't...
They...

34:56.094 --> 34:59.029
No, they weren't.

34:59.097 --> 35:03.534
Well, maybe that's why
he started acting so strangely.

35:03.601 --> 35:05.535
What do you mean?

35:05.603 --> 35:08.936
Well, it used to be that...

35:09.006 --> 35:11.497
Julian spent all his free time
with his computer.

35:11.576 --> 35:13.806
All he cared about was his work.

35:13.878 --> 35:16.938
I mean, he never had
any interest in all at sports.

35:17.014 --> 35:21.075
And then one day,
he decides he wants to play tennis.

35:21.152 --> 35:24.019
- Next, he's fishing.
- He mention where he went fishing?

35:24.088 --> 35:26.579
Shaker Lake.

35:34.065 --> 35:35.999
Michael, are you all right?

35:36.067 --> 35:39.059
- Yeah, KITT, I'm just thinking.
- About what?

35:39.137 --> 35:42.834
I think Julian's fishing trips
were a cover for something else.

35:42.907 --> 35:45.467
Punch up the dates when
the thefts were reported, will ya?

35:48.446 --> 35:50.937
Check this out.
Each of Julian's trips...

35:51.015 --> 35:53.381
took place a day or two
after a robbery.

35:53.451 --> 35:57.478
All right, plot me the fastest course
to Shaker Lake. Let's go.

36:09.567 --> 36:12.263
Michael, there are two things
I still don't understand.

36:12.336 --> 36:15.362
- Only two?
- What were Julian's fishing trips a cover for?

36:15.439 --> 36:19.899
My guess is they gave him a place
to stash the payoff money.

36:23.347 --> 36:25.281
There's his car, KITT.

36:25.349 --> 36:27.112
Looks like we hit the jackpot.

36:27.185 --> 36:30.882
Michael, my sensors are picking up
two voices emanating from the cabin.

36:30.955 --> 36:33.014
Two voices?

36:38.596 --> 36:41.656
Here, you can have all the computer programs
and the money Connie gave me.

36:41.732 --> 36:46.431
That's very generous of you, Julian.
Now, put the briefcase in the gym bag.

36:46.504 --> 36:49.667
You've gotta believe me.
I didn't kill her. I swear!

36:49.740 --> 36:51.867
Sure, Julian. Sure.

36:51.943 --> 36:55.310
You can tell me all about it
on the way back to town.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.325
Who are you?

37:09.393 --> 37:12.226
I'll tell you later.
You stay put.

37:16.867 --> 37:18.494
Michael, behind you!

37:18.569 --> 37:21.436
One more move,
and the lady's a memory.

37:33.884 --> 37:36.250
Armand, you don't know
what you're getting yourself into here.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.254
That's what you think.

37:38.322 --> 37:40.586
Let's go. You're coming
with me. A-Are you sure?

37:40.658 --> 37:43.650
I mean, I'm really not very good company,
and we have so little in common.

37:43.728 --> 37:46.595
If you wanna leave, just leave.
You don't need the girl.

37:46.664 --> 37:50.361
She's my insurance policy.
Now, there's one road out of this dump,

37:50.434 --> 37:53.267
and if I see either one of you on it,
the lady dies.

37:53.337 --> 37:56.829
- Michael, aren't you gonna do something?
- Yeah. He's gonna wave good-bye.

37:56.907 --> 37:59.205
Let's go.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.871
Hey, who is she?
And who are you, anyway?

38:01.946 --> 38:04.176
Believe it or not,
she's a private eye.

38:04.248 --> 38:07.445
My name is Michael Knight. I work for
the Foundation for Law and Government.

38:07.518 --> 38:10.009
Julian, I gotta bring you in.

38:10.087 --> 38:13.488
I had to ask. Look, it's time to put
your life back together and stop running.

38:13.557 --> 38:17.186
Yeah? So what about Armand?
Are you gonna let him get away scot-free?

38:17.261 --> 38:19.661
No, I'm not.
Come on.

38:22.133 --> 38:26.001
You know, you really should have
both hands on the wheel.

38:26.070 --> 38:30.006
Hey, shut up, huh?
I don't need you to tell me how to drive.

38:30.074 --> 38:32.269
It was merely a suggestion.

38:40.651 --> 38:45.384
There's that black car again. I'd
hate to show them I wasn't bluffing.

38:57.034 --> 39:00.526
- What are you talking about? There's no car back there.
- There was a minute ago.

39:01.772 --> 39:04.434
Let's try to hold it together,
okay, Armand?

39:20.191 --> 39:23.126
It all started at the tennis club.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.991
She wanted me to show her a program.

39:25.062 --> 39:27.622
That's the only way I was involved.
You gotta believe me.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.689
I didn't kill her.

39:29.767 --> 39:31.632
I believe you, Julian.
I believe you.

39:31.702 --> 39:35.468
But from now on,
it's up to the police.

39:45.015 --> 39:47.040
What the...

39:48.119 --> 39:50.110
There's nobody driving that...
Did you see that?

39:50.187 --> 39:53.645
There's nobody driving the car!
Armand, get a hold of yourself.

39:59.997 --> 40:02.397
- Pull over!
- I don't believe this!

40:02.466 --> 40:04.798
Didn't you hear me?
I said, pull over!

40:04.869 --> 40:07.667
You better do what he says.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.330
That car means business.

40:32.296 --> 40:34.423
What the...

40:36.100 --> 40:38.967
- Nice work, KITT.
- Just following your instructions, Michael.

40:43.107 --> 40:46.167
All right, man, you're too dumb
to be the brains behind this whole scam.

40:46.243 --> 40:48.177
I want some names.
I don't know names.

40:48.245 --> 40:51.646
You're in for murder,
extortion and kidnapping.

40:51.715 --> 40:54.616
You wanna go to prison all by
yourself? Hey, get out of here, man.

40:54.685 --> 40:57.677
She was my old lady. Why should I kill her?
Maybe she was having some action on the side?

40:57.755 --> 40:59.689
I was cool about that.
Now, who was it?

40:59.757 --> 41:03.215
I don't know!
I never saw him.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.694
I just knew she had somebody on
the side, man. I don't know who.

41:05.763 --> 41:09.221
All right, get out of here.
He's all yours.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.632
Julian.

41:12.770 --> 41:16.831
- I'm sorry.
- Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?

41:16.907 --> 41:19.205
Yeah, it is.

41:19.276 --> 41:21.369
But I promise you,
I'll do everything I can to help you.

41:42.700 --> 41:44.930
I don't know what to say, except I'm sorry.

41:45.002 --> 41:47.368
I never thought to give your husband
the benefit of the doubt.

41:47.438 --> 41:50.407
Well, as long as Julian's safe,
that's all I care about.

41:50.474 --> 41:53.637
Would you like to see him?
Of course.

41:53.711 --> 41:57.772
But I feel sort of funny seeing him now.
I mean, after everything that's happened.

41:57.848 --> 42:02.080
Well, I'll go along, if you like. I think it's the
least I can do after all the anguish I've caused you.

42:02.152 --> 42:05.849
Oh, thanks. Just give me a second
to get ready, okay?

42:05.923 --> 42:10.019
Sure.
Linda, I got one quick question.

42:10.094 --> 42:12.892
You told me Julian
was never interested in sports, right?

42:12.963 --> 42:15.227
Not until he joined
that stupid tennis club.

42:15.299 --> 42:18.530
That's when all the problems started.
Why did he join?

42:19.970 --> 42:23.462
A man at work talked him into it.
Do you remember who that was?

42:23.541 --> 42:26.476
Yes. As a matter of fact, I do.

42:26.544 --> 42:29.604
Hello?

42:29.680 --> 42:32.808
You don't know me, Mr. Stevens,
but I'm an old friend of Connie Chasen's.

42:32.883 --> 42:37.650
We went through modeling school together back
in New York. Is that what you called to tell me?

42:37.721 --> 42:41.282
The night Connie was killed,
she brought a briefcase to my apartment.

42:41.358 --> 42:45.089
She said if anything happened to her,
I should get in touch with you.

42:45.162 --> 42:48.893
- Look, I don't know what you're talking about.
- In that case, I'll just turn it over to the police.

42:48.966 --> 42:51.958
No, wait.
Um, you don't have to do that.

42:52.036 --> 42:54.470
Connie also said
there'd be some money in it for me.

42:56.140 --> 42:58.131
All right.
Where can I meet you?

42:58.208 --> 43:00.540
How about the tennis club?

43:00.611 --> 43:05.605
Okay, the tennis club.
How will I know you?

43:05.683 --> 43:08.413
I'll know you.

43:28.272 --> 43:30.968
I believe we spoke
on the telephone earlier.

43:31.041 --> 43:33.032
You have something for me?

43:34.111 --> 43:36.102
And you have something for me?

43:43.253 --> 43:45.244
It's all yours.

43:55.933 --> 43:57.628
I never want to see you again.

43:57.701 --> 43:59.635
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

44:06.310 --> 44:08.835
- There he is.
- Yeah, I see him.

44:27.598 --> 44:29.395
Let's get him, buddy.

44:57.494 --> 44:59.689
Michael, I detect an obstruction ahead.

45:03.534 --> 45:06.298
He's getting away in the tow truck.

45:06.370 --> 45:08.565
Let's go, buddy!

45:08.639 --> 45:10.800
Yeah!

45:16.180 --> 45:17.943
Whoo!

45:26.857 --> 45:29.758
He's just ahead, Michael.

45:32.129 --> 45:34.962
All right, let's head him off.

45:44.641 --> 45:48.236
- He's heading for the wrecking yard.
- Stay with him, pal.

45:53.584 --> 45:55.108
You see him?

45:57.654 --> 45:59.588
There he is.

46:01.992 --> 46:04.460
Michael, it looks like
he's going to ram us.

46:15.539 --> 46:17.598
Whoo!

46:23.514 --> 46:26.711
If I had nerves,
that would've been nerve-racking.

46:39.563 --> 46:42.999
You know, Devon was wrong.

46:43.066 --> 46:45.500
We got lots to talk about.

46:50.974 --> 46:54.034
I still can't figure out
what Stevens's motive was.

46:54.111 --> 46:58.480
Devon learned that a decision had been made in
secret to replace Stevens as president of the company.

46:58.549 --> 47:02.110
Unfortunately, he got wind of it,
so Stevens decided...

47:02.186 --> 47:07.249
to trade Delton's experimental programs to
another company in exchange for a future job.

47:07.324 --> 47:11.124
But why would he bring in the Foundation
if he was behind the whole caper?

47:11.195 --> 47:13.595
He thought it would remove
suspicion from him.

47:13.664 --> 47:18.863
Besides, he was setting Julian up to take the fall,
not only for the rip-off, but for Connie's murder too.

47:18.936 --> 47:21.871
I was so sure all that was going on...

47:21.939 --> 47:25.102
was a little hanky-panky
between Julian and Connie.

47:25.175 --> 47:27.769
God. What'll happen to him?

47:27.845 --> 47:30.439
Julian?
Under the circumstances, probation.

47:30.514 --> 47:34.678
Oh, I hope so. I'm gonna feel real guilty
till he and Linda get back together.

47:34.751 --> 47:40.189
What on earth is here? Julian told me to tell
you that is a small token of his appreciation.

47:40.257 --> 47:43.590
What am I supposed to do
with it? Here, I'll show you.

47:45.095 --> 47:47.120
Devon, I think you'll
find it rather amusing.

47:47.197 --> 47:49.495
Really?

47:49.566 --> 47:52.967
Watch it, Devon. You'll get hooked.

47:53.036 --> 47:55.698
Never.
