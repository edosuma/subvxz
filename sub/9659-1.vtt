00:05.154 --> 00:08.794
Welcome to a very special
season of The Amazing Race.

00:10.194 --> 00:11.674
Well, hello, everyone!

00:11.674 --> 00:13.394
My name is Tyler
Oakley. -Korey Kuhl.

00:13.394 --> 00:15.674
I'm Joslyn Davis.
-And I'm Erin Robinson.

00:15.674 --> 00:19.354
<i>These 11 teams connect with
millions of people every day.</i>

00:19.354 --> 00:22.354
SuperVine in Birmingham!
(ALL SCREAM)

00:22.354 --> 00:24.594
<i>What happens when you take</i>

00:24.594 --> 00:26.874
<i>the world's biggest social
influencers offline...</i>

00:26.874 --> 00:28.834
This is how I hitchhike.

00:28.834 --> 00:30.314
Whoo!

00:30.314 --> 00:32.034
Amazing. -Amazing.

00:32.034 --> 00:35.144
<i>...to race each other
in the real world?</i>

00:36.234 --> 00:37.874
<i>Time to find out!</i>

00:37.874 --> 00:39.504
COLE: Mom!

00:40.594 --> 00:42.674
(PHONES RING)
<i>Our teams are at home</i>

00:42.674 --> 00:45.194
<i>and have no idea the race
is about to start now.</i>

00:45.194 --> 00:47.194
Mom! BLAIR: Phil Keoghan!

00:47.194 --> 00:50.034
Oh, my God, wait. How do I
get it? -What do you want, Phil?

00:50.034 --> 00:53.714
PHIL: <i>You're about to embark
on the adventure of a lifetime.</i>

00:53.714 --> 00:58.474
In just 21 days, you'll visit
18 cities in 10 countries

00:58.474 --> 01:01.994
and travel more
than 27,000 miles.

01:01.994 --> 01:03.834
Oh. Oh! Oh!

01:03.834 --> 01:08.074
And I have your next
clue here in Mexico City

01:08.074 --> 01:10.674
at the Monument
of the Revolution.

01:10.674 --> 01:12.674
Monument of the Revolution.

01:12.674 --> 01:14.194
We're going to Mexico City!

01:14.194 --> 01:16.234
We couldn't even find our
way back home last night.

01:16.234 --> 01:19.514
When I say 'go', grab
your bags, run outside,

01:19.514 --> 01:23.624
make your way to the nearest airport
and then find me here in Mexico.

01:23.624 --> 01:25.514
Whoo!
(SCREAMS)

01:25.514 --> 01:26.794
Let's get things started.

01:26.794 --> 01:28.874
We're starting right
now! Oh, my God.

01:28.874 --> 01:30.474
The world is waiting for you.

01:30.474 --> 01:32.154
Oh, my God! Good luck.

01:32.154 --> 01:34.314
Travel safe!
-Travel safe.

01:34.314 --> 01:35.834
No way.
-Let's go, Phil.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.474
Oh, man!
-What the heck?

01:38.474 --> 01:40.234
Go!

01:40.234 --> 01:41.754
BOTH: Go!

01:41.754 --> 01:43.594
(LAUGHS)
Oh, my God.

01:43.594 --> 01:45.154
Alright, go! Oh, my God.

01:45.154 --> 01:47.074
Oh, my God!
-OK, grab this.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.714
(SQUEALS)

01:51.034 --> 01:52.754
Good luck, alright?

01:52.754 --> 01:55.554
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

01:55.554 --> 01:57.194
Alright, gotta go.
You tryin' to do that?

01:57.194 --> 01:58.674
Are you tryin' to do that?

01:58.674 --> 02:00.954
Oh, my God. -Wait,
Joslyn, you speak Spanish.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.794
Si! Si! Vamonos.

02:02.794 --> 02:04.474
I'm not even crying.

02:04.474 --> 02:06.634
Bye. I love you. -Bye,
Mama. I love you, too.

02:06.634 --> 02:08.954
Let's go, baby!

02:08.954 --> 02:10.473
(SCREAMS INDISTINCTLY)

02:10.473 --> 02:11.944
Daddy! Daddy!

02:14.594 --> 02:16.224
Got my passport.
Alright, let's go.

02:16.224 --> 02:18.474
Mexico City. We're going.

02:19.834 --> 02:22.074
(ALL TALK OVER ONE ANOTHER)

02:23.314 --> 02:25.434
Oh, there's our cab,
right over there.

02:25.434 --> 02:26.834
Oh, my God!

02:26.834 --> 02:29.794
Going to Mexico! How
do we get to Mexico?

02:29.794 --> 02:31.194
Hi. We need to
get to the airport.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.954
TYLER: Hi.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.434
KOREY: Yeah.
Something like that.

02:35.434 --> 02:37.274
KURT: I'm in!

02:39.104 --> 02:40.714
Are you driving us to Mexico?

02:43.954 --> 02:46.594
We are headed to
Mexico City. -Whoo!

02:46.594 --> 02:50.274
To get that message from Phil, just
starting right now, it's so surreal.

02:50.274 --> 02:51.914
I can't believe this is
happening. -Oh, my God.

02:51.914 --> 02:53.034
Dream come true right now.

02:53.034 --> 02:55.994
We're racing from home.
Like, what's going on?

02:55.994 --> 02:58.074
Yeah, it's crazy.
This is definitely...

02:58.074 --> 02:59.674
You really threw us
for a loop on this one.

02:59.674 --> 03:02.874
Do you have the passports?
-Don't freak me out like that.

03:02.874 --> 03:05.754
Welcome...to... BOTH:
The Amazing Race.

03:05.754 --> 03:08.234
# Dah dah dah,
dah-dah-dah... #

03:08.234 --> 03:09.514
I just love that song.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:00.794 --> 04:02.554
Thank you.

04:03.954 --> 04:06.594
Oh, you want my
autograph? MAN: Yes, sir!

04:06.594 --> 04:07.634
So cute.

04:07.634 --> 04:10.994
Tyler and I met in college
at Michigan State University.

04:10.994 --> 04:13.274
The day we met was actually the
day I made my YouTube channel.

04:13.274 --> 04:15.394
You all look
incredible. (LAUGHTER)

04:15.394 --> 04:17.714
We make videos online and
we have a podcast together.

04:17.714 --> 04:20.673
I think that people watch us
because they might not feel

04:20.673 --> 04:22.714
like they have somebody
that they can connect to.

04:22.714 --> 04:24.674
I didn't have somebody
like that growing up.

04:24.674 --> 04:27.114
Like, I may have had
gay characters on TV,

04:27.114 --> 04:29.864
but I couldn't go online and find
somebody just sharing themselves.

04:29.864 --> 04:31.234
Oh, my God.

04:31.234 --> 04:33.154
We're super fans
of The Amazing Race.

04:33.154 --> 04:36.514
We are 100% going to win. -You
can write the cheque right now.

04:36.514 --> 04:38.074
Yeah. -We'll take it.

04:39.834 --> 04:43.034
Monumento a la Revolucion.

04:43.034 --> 04:44.674
There you go, but you're
making it sound French.

04:44.674 --> 04:46.394
I know. Revolucion.

04:46.394 --> 04:48.074
(LAUGHS)

04:48.074 --> 04:51.274
Matt and I are in kind of
a high-stakes relationship

04:51.274 --> 04:54.074
because we don't only work
really closely together,

04:54.074 --> 04:57.354
but we have been engaged for
almost three and a half years.

04:57.354 --> 04:58.834
We have not set a
wedding date yet.

04:58.834 --> 05:00.754
Welcome to Dance
Tutorials Live -

05:00.754 --> 05:02.984
the best place online
to learn how to dance.

05:02.984 --> 05:06.304
I'm a choreographer,
a dancer and teacher

05:06.304 --> 05:09.714
and I also produce the largest
dance YouTube channel in the world.

05:09.714 --> 05:12.394
Yeah, I think that the
race is make or break.

05:12.394 --> 05:16.234
It can be a huge boost for us
in just trusting each other.

05:17.754 --> 05:21.034
I'm so excited. Oh, my gosh.

05:21.034 --> 05:22.984
Working out! Working out!

05:22.984 --> 05:27.194
Joslyn and I are internet hosts
and producers at Clevver Media.

05:27.194 --> 05:30.274
Clevver is the number one
entertainment news outlet on YouTube.

05:30.274 --> 05:32.274
Snap, snap, snap. Slay.

05:33.914 --> 05:35.394
You know I'm excited
to do the race with you.

05:35.394 --> 05:36.754
Yeah.

05:36.754 --> 05:39.914
Zach and I met almost
three years ago.

05:39.914 --> 05:42.234
Rachel was the first
girl that I ever kissed.

05:42.234 --> 05:44.794
We have been married
for almost 11 months.

05:45.834 --> 05:47.834
Whoo!

05:47.834 --> 05:49.674
I make Vine videos.

05:49.674 --> 05:52.714
In those six seconds, there'll
be a little bit of magic.

05:52.714 --> 05:55.554
I kept growing the channel
and now it's at a place

05:55.554 --> 05:59.114
where it's kind of thrown us for
a whirlwind for the last few years.

06:00.434 --> 06:04.434
We are incredibly excited.
Pumped. Take a deep breath.

06:04.434 --> 06:08.194
I'm an attorney and I'm
also an OBGYN by profession.

06:08.194 --> 06:09.514
Work that runway.

06:09.514 --> 06:12.394
It was hard on me when
Blair left at the age of 17

06:12.394 --> 06:14.154
to pursue her
career on YouTube.

06:14.154 --> 06:17.954
Mainly my videos are
make-up and hair tutorials.

06:17.954 --> 06:21.634
I can't believe what started
out as a hobby in my bedroom

06:21.634 --> 06:24.074
filming videos - not
like that, Daddy -

06:24.074 --> 06:26.594
was turning into this.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.994
I am single for the
race and I am not afraid

06:28.994 --> 06:32.234
to use a little bit of Southern
charm to maybe try to help us.

06:32.234 --> 06:36.114
We bring age and maturity.
-And I bring the lipstick.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.914
COLE: I'm kind of sad.

06:40.914 --> 06:43.354
You know, we're both big
family people so we...

06:44.914 --> 06:47.074
..we never leave.

06:47.074 --> 06:51.114
My name is Cole Brant and
this is my mom. I'm her son.

06:51.114 --> 06:55.114
My career has been
being a mom of six kids.

06:55.114 --> 06:57.554
I do feel that
this race is a way

06:57.554 --> 07:00.034
that I can show my
family a different side.

07:00.034 --> 07:02.154
Mom, I'm going out.
-Is your room clean?

07:02.154 --> 07:03.514
She'll never notice.

07:03.514 --> 07:05.034
I really just
make funny videos.

07:05.034 --> 07:06.914
And if you look
through my Vine page,

07:06.914 --> 07:08.514
you'll see videos that I
make with my mom and dad.

07:08.514 --> 07:10.794
Pretty sure that my fans like my
parents more than they like me,

07:10.794 --> 07:12.754
so I've got to throw
them in there a lot.

07:14.834 --> 07:18.074
It sounds like it's going to
be a lot of social media people.

07:18.074 --> 07:19.874
That's what I do for a living.

07:19.874 --> 07:21.834
I make videos on, you
know, frisbee trick shots.

07:21.834 --> 07:27.194
We met at the 2006 Ultimate Frisbee
season at the University of Florida.

07:27.194 --> 07:29.554
We ended up winning a national
championship together, so...

07:32.514 --> 07:33.794
Oh!

07:33.794 --> 07:35.234
My whole thing is
just trying to get

07:35.234 --> 07:36.714
people excited about
throwing the frisbee.

07:36.714 --> 07:37.874
It's been a real blast.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.794
Being on the race, we're
definitely confident.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.034
Brodie is the single one
on this trip. I am single.

07:43.034 --> 07:46.514
We deal with hot chicks all the
time 'cause we're frisbee guys.

07:46.514 --> 07:49.154
Brodie sometimes gets
distracted by certain things

07:49.154 --> 07:50.834
and so I just have
to keep him on course.

07:50.834 --> 07:53.314
This is gonna be the
time of our lives.

07:53.314 --> 07:55.314
I know. Can you believe
we're doing this?

07:55.314 --> 07:58.154
We have been dating for
the last three years.

07:58.154 --> 07:59.834
And working together.
-We also work together.

07:59.834 --> 08:02.314
And living together. -So we
spend a lot of time together.

08:02.314 --> 08:04.794
Ashley started her career
as a professional gamer.

08:04.794 --> 08:06.554
I knew who you were.
I was a big fan.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.994
I was one of the first
members on his website.

08:08.994 --> 08:12.274
We run an online video
channel all about video games

08:12.274 --> 08:13.794
called Rooster Teeth.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.914
Our first show that we
made, Red Versus Blue,

08:15.914 --> 08:18.074
is the longest running web series
in the history of the internet.

08:18.074 --> 08:20.794
Being a lifelong gamer, what we're
so excited about with the race

08:20.794 --> 08:23.314
is that it takes the whole world
and turns it into one giant game.

08:23.314 --> 08:24.674
We couldn't imagine
anything better.

08:27.154 --> 08:29.274
Horrible, Jessica. Terrible.

08:29.274 --> 08:31.714
Is it Cole and his mom? Yes!

08:33.754 --> 08:37.433
We knew you guys would
be here. Wakey, wakey!

08:37.433 --> 08:41.193
We just ran into Cole and
Sheri and we love them.

08:41.193 --> 08:43.703
I knew who Cole was
from social media.

08:43.703 --> 08:45.474
You guys haven't eaten
at all or anything?

08:45.474 --> 08:47.514
No, we're starving. We're used
to it anyways. We're models.

08:50.114 --> 08:51.754
Instagram has
definitely helped us.

08:51.754 --> 08:53.994
It's something new that they're
integrating within modelling.

08:53.994 --> 08:55.914
Clients say, "If we
send you this swimsuit,

08:55.914 --> 08:57.554
"will you Instagram
a hot photo of it?"

08:57.554 --> 08:59.874
And the more followers you
have, the more money you get.

08:59.874 --> 09:03.514
We are absolutely planning on
using our looks if we need to.

09:03.514 --> 09:06.914
We only have what we brought
and I guess we're bringing it.

09:06.914 --> 09:10.584
I mean, to be woken up by
two models, it was usual.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.034
Cole is strong. -Yes.

09:12.034 --> 09:13.514
He's young, he's
smart. He's athletic.

09:13.514 --> 09:16.994
I believe in multiple girlfriends.
I believe in multiple wives.

09:16.994 --> 09:18.794
Are we cougars?

09:18.794 --> 09:20.514
Maybe.

09:20.514 --> 09:23.274
If we were in college,
we would go after Cole.

09:23.274 --> 09:26.634
I might knock on his
dorm. In college only.

09:29.914 --> 09:31.994
Oh, my God! It's
Tyler. (SCREAMS)

09:31.994 --> 09:35.034
Oh, my God! (SCREAMS)

09:35.034 --> 09:36.824
Wait, come love me.

09:36.824 --> 09:38.394
How are you?
-Hi, how are you?

09:38.394 --> 09:42.634
I've met Tyler Oakley before and
we have a lot of mutual friends.

09:42.634 --> 09:46.474
I love his videos
and I am a huge fan.

09:46.474 --> 09:47.944
Hi.

09:47.944 --> 09:48.994
Sure.

09:48.994 --> 09:51.514
Thank you so much. Of
course. Nice to meet you.

09:53.474 --> 09:56.154
Do you do YouTube or...?
She does. She did YouTube.

09:56.154 --> 09:58.704
Oh, what kind of videos?
Well, she did one viral video.

09:58.704 --> 10:00.994
There's this Southwest flight
attendant, like, it went viral.

10:00.994 --> 10:02.194
I've heard of that.

10:02.194 --> 10:05.584
Everybody gets their very own
teeny weeny yellow Southwest bikini.

10:05.584 --> 10:07.074
One size fits all.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.794
I'm a flight attendant
for Southwest Airlines.

10:08.794 --> 10:10.314
I've been flying
for about nine years.

10:10.314 --> 10:11.944
I just like to put
my own spin on it

10:11.944 --> 10:15.394
and I just feel like people kind of
pay attention more when it's funny

10:15.394 --> 10:17.274
and it went viral

10:17.274 --> 10:20.074
and within a week, we had 10
million and now it's 22 million.

10:20.074 --> 10:24.354
I'm a single mom and we're both
pretty protective of each other.

10:24.354 --> 10:27.274

have enough pieces.

there's more pieces

30:39.202 --> 30:40.642
or do they need to be
all the same colour?

30:41.962 --> 30:43.202

30:43.202 --> 30:44.842

or all white? What do you think?

one colour. -OK.

30:51.482 --> 30:52.922

30:52.922 --> 30:55.642
it had to actually be one
colour or the other colour,

30:55.642 --> 30:58.122

didn't have enough pieces.

keep them with me.

is going back in.

on the bottom here.

32:09.202 --> 32:11.842

on this one piece.

32:11.842 --> 32:15.122
I feel like it needs
to go the other way.

32:15.122 --> 32:18.442
I got 13 white pieces but I
realised some of them are duplicates

32:18.442 --> 32:21.042
so I just decided to
start digging again,

32:21.042 --> 32:24.282
see if I could get more pieces from
another colour and just start over.

32:24.282 --> 32:25.442
Let's go back.

32:25.442 --> 32:27.002
Is it all one colour?

32:27.002 --> 32:28.722
I think it might
be all one colour.

32:28.722 --> 32:31.682
OK, I'm gonna go back and get more
pieces. I don't think I have enough.

32:31.682 --> 32:34.682
Maybe the drums are down here.

32:34.682 --> 32:36.602
Holy cow! They were
down here all along.

32:36.602 --> 32:38.562
I'm making big mistakes.

32:38.562 --> 32:41.882
I dropped some of my pieces and
I don't know how many I dropped.

32:41.882 --> 32:45.562
Alright. Where are the drums?

32:46.642 --> 32:50.162
There's nine. I'm looking
for a couple more pieces.

32:50.162 --> 32:52.162
Hey, where do you
think the drums are?

32:52.162 --> 32:54.122
I don't know. I'd tell
you but I don't know.

32:54.122 --> 32:55.802
Is it something in here?

32:55.802 --> 32:57.522
Come on, Jessica!

32:59.682 --> 33:03.242
Yeah, shovel, yeah.
That's why it's there.

33:04.522 --> 33:05.962
I need two more.

33:05.962 --> 33:08.482
Are you finding little
drums on the ground?

33:08.482 --> 33:10.802
Scott, do you know where
the drums are? -I don't.

33:10.802 --> 33:12.162
Do you think we
came up a wrong way?

33:12.162 --> 33:13.642
I do. -You do?

33:13.642 --> 33:16.662
Follow the drums. This
is getting desperate now.

33:23.420 --> 33:25.860
I thought I had all the
white ones. I just...

33:25.860 --> 33:29.260
For some reason, that
last one wasn't going in.

33:29.260 --> 33:30.740
I'm going to try light blue.

33:30.740 --> 33:32.620
I'm bleeding.
-You're bleeding?

33:32.620 --> 33:34.260
Yeah. -Oh, my
goodness gracious.

33:34.260 --> 33:35.340
That's hard.

33:35.340 --> 33:36.380
I believe in you.
-Thank you.

33:36.380 --> 33:38.340
You got this.
-One more.

33:39.380 --> 33:41.620
Alright. Judge?

33:43.260 --> 33:45.260
Yes. Yes!

33:45.260 --> 33:47.020
Thank you so much. Thank you.

33:47.020 --> 33:49.740
Whoo! -I got it.

33:49.740 --> 33:51.260
Good job, babe.

33:51.260 --> 33:54.100
"Make your way to
your first Pit Stop."

33:56.020 --> 33:59.420
Mexico has more museums than
any other country in the world,

33:59.420 --> 34:03.620
<i>and the Museo Soumaya is the
most visited in the country.</i>

34:03.620 --> 34:08.100
The last team to check in there
at the mat <i>may be eliminated.</i>

34:08.100 --> 34:11.139
Alright, let's go. Good
luck, guys. -Good luck.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.900
OK. I'm ready to present.

34:19.139 --> 34:20.860
Thank you so much. Thank you.

34:20.860 --> 34:23.460
Tyler finished before me but
I think we can catch up still.

34:23.460 --> 34:25.340
There's a lot of teams
that are still doing it.

34:25.340 --> 34:27.300
Are you done? -Yeah.

34:27.300 --> 34:28.659
We're in second,
we're in second. -OK.

34:28.659 --> 34:30.340
Bye, friends.

34:30.340 --> 34:33.420
We can beat the dancers
'cause we're right behind them.

34:33.420 --> 34:36.699
Yeah, numero uno. Whoo!

34:36.699 --> 34:40.659
Where is Kurt?
Come on, Kurt.

34:40.659 --> 34:46.340
(ALL SING AND LAUGH)

34:46.340 --> 34:48.010
Oh, my God.

34:48.010 --> 34:51.489
Shoot, shoot, shoot. Holy cow.

34:51.489 --> 34:53.940
What did I do to myself here?

34:53.940 --> 34:56.380
My dad is still over there
looking for something.

34:56.380 --> 34:57.860
13.

34:57.860 --> 35:01.300
He hasn't started building
anything. I'm so panicked.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.490
I know I gotta go back in the
tunnel to get to the drums.

35:05.140 --> 35:07.180
Yes.

35:07.180 --> 35:08.700
I think I need to go back.

35:08.700 --> 35:10.580
I think there's
a missing piece.

35:10.580 --> 35:12.100
Dammit!

35:12.100 --> 35:14.970
Thank you. Right.
Piece of cake.

35:14.970 --> 35:16.820
This is ridiculous.

35:19.620 --> 35:22.420
To work so hard this first leg
and to potentially come in first

35:22.420 --> 35:23.660
would be like a
dream come true.

35:23.660 --> 35:25.860
We could beat Matt and Dana.

35:25.860 --> 35:28.700
They were literally probably only
three minutes in front of you.

35:28.700 --> 35:30.740
DANA: Oh, my God. No, no, no.

35:30.740 --> 35:32.300
Oh, my God, we
passed the dancers.

35:32.300 --> 35:35.060
That was them. That
was the dancers.

35:35.060 --> 35:37.100
So it's gonna be
a run. -Oh, my God.

35:37.100 --> 35:38.490
We have to get
around that taxi, sir.

35:38.490 --> 35:40.060
We have to pass.
We have to pass.

35:40.060 --> 35:42.660
Numero uno! Numero uno! Whoo!

35:42.660 --> 35:43.700
It's so close.

35:43.700 --> 35:45.060
It's going to be a
footrace to the mat.

35:45.060 --> 35:46.970
It's literally going to be
a footrace to the finish.

35:48.140 --> 35:49.820
Literally right behind us.

35:49.820 --> 35:51.660
Go! You see them?

35:51.660 --> 35:53.260
Gracias.

35:57.420 --> 35:59.620
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

35:59.620 --> 36:02.530
Whoo!
-Welcome to Mexico City.

36:02.530 --> 36:05.970
Dana and Matt, I am pleased to tell
you, on the first leg of this race

36:05.970 --> 36:07.740
you are team number one!

36:07.740 --> 36:10.140
(BOTH CHEER)

36:11.180 --> 36:14.530
Oh, my God! -Man, you
made us run for it.

36:14.530 --> 36:18.010
Tyler and Korey, I'm pleased to
tell you, you are team number two.

36:18.010 --> 36:19.260
Pretty good way to start.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.940
Not a bad way to start.

36:20.940 --> 36:24.180
Are we going to see some interesting
things with your hair on this race?

36:24.180 --> 36:25.780
What's happening right
now? -Well, it's...

36:25.780 --> 36:27.820
It looks fabulous.
-It's wind blown.

36:27.820 --> 36:29.530
Don't come for me, Phil.

36:29.530 --> 36:32.940
We've been fans of the
race for years and years.

36:32.940 --> 36:34.380
We've loved the race.

36:34.380 --> 36:37.460
And to hear Phil say to us
that we were team number one...

36:37.460 --> 36:39.100
It's a dream come
true. It really is.

36:42.010 --> 36:43.380
Alright, get on that mat.

36:43.380 --> 36:46.140
Why don't you tell Kristina
what it is exactly you guys do?

36:46.140 --> 36:49.460
What's your deal?
-We make short, magical videos.

36:49.460 --> 36:52.180
We're not allowed to use magic
on the race, unfortunately.

36:52.180 --> 36:53.940
Phil, could I take a
selfie? -Can we take a selfie?

36:59.820 --> 37:01.740
OK, that fit. Is
this the judge?

37:02.740 --> 37:03.740
Yes!

37:05.140 --> 37:06.460
Alright, I think I got it.

37:08.660 --> 37:09.860
Thank you.

37:11.100 --> 37:12.740
I think I'm just
missing a piece.

37:12.740 --> 37:14.260
Oh, my God.

37:16.260 --> 37:18.100
Just, I don't know if
I have all the pieces.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.700
Crap!

37:20.530 --> 37:22.260
Cameron, you look
a little relieved.

37:22.260 --> 37:23.860
Ended up being in
the back of the pack.

37:23.860 --> 37:25.490
No, you're more towards
the front of the pack.

37:25.490 --> 37:27.740
Feels really good.
-Top half. It feels good.

37:28.970 --> 37:30.900
(DRUMS BEAT)

37:32.220 --> 37:35.140
Trying to figure out
what I'm doing wrong here.

37:35.140 --> 37:36.740
I think I'm done.

37:38.900 --> 37:41.460
Thank you. Oh,
my God, Brittany.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.700
I think I got it.
Oh, baby Jesus.

37:43.700 --> 37:45.580
Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

37:45.580 --> 37:48.660
It's depressing to see
teams leave like that.

37:49.970 --> 37:51.970
Brodie and Kurt, you
are team number five.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.340
Yeah!

37:53.340 --> 37:54.860
Sound good?
-Great job, guys.

37:54.860 --> 37:57.380
Burnie and Ashley, that would
make you team number six.

37:59.700 --> 38:01.420
Is it just us two, mama?

38:01.420 --> 38:04.220
That really sucks, doesn't it?
Weren't we the first ones down here?

38:04.220 --> 38:05.490
Yes.

38:05.490 --> 38:07.220
Erin won't give up
while she's down there.

38:07.220 --> 38:09.460
Oh, I know my dad won't give up.
-She won't give up. She'll keep going.

38:09.460 --> 38:11.180
None of our team-mates
would give up.

38:11.180 --> 38:14.940
Do you want to take the penalty?
-How long is the penalty?

38:14.940 --> 38:17.060
Four hours. -Oh, gosh.

38:18.060 --> 38:19.940
Are the other teams
putting it together?

38:19.940 --> 38:21.660
I think they're done.

38:21.660 --> 38:25.340
I think we're the last ones.
-What do you think?

38:25.340 --> 38:27.580
I don't know. I don't
know if we should.

38:27.580 --> 38:28.970
Let's do it.

38:36.215 --> 38:37.455
Do you want to
take the penalty?

38:37.455 --> 38:39.135
Do you mind going
back and just looking

38:39.135 --> 38:40.535
and seeing if
anyone is doing it?

38:40.535 --> 38:42.765
If they aren't, then you and
I will do the penalty together?

38:42.765 --> 38:44.015
OK. -Want to do that?

38:44.015 --> 38:45.285
Let's do it. -OK.

38:45.285 --> 38:46.615
Alright, here we go.

38:49.175 --> 38:50.895
He's still here.

38:50.895 --> 38:52.935
People just ran in
so I'm good, I'm good.

38:55.415 --> 38:59.175
You want to pick a number?
-Yes, I'm going to go with seven.

38:59.175 --> 39:02.575
You are so correct.
Team number seven!

39:02.575 --> 39:05.735
And you are team
number eight! -Whoo!

39:08.415 --> 39:10.805
This cave is, like,
starting to get to me.

39:10.805 --> 39:12.415
You want to take the penalty?

39:12.415 --> 39:15.695
One more time and then if I
can't get this then I'm down.

39:15.695 --> 39:18.015
13 pieces have
to fit together.

39:18.015 --> 39:19.975
Um, did I just get this?

39:19.975 --> 39:22.175
Alright, I'm going
to go try this.

39:22.175 --> 39:23.575
Oh, I think you got it.

39:23.575 --> 39:25.175
It would be a
miracle from God.

39:25.175 --> 39:29.055
Oh, my gosh! Oh, I love you!

39:29.055 --> 39:30.495
Come on.

39:30.495 --> 39:32.655
Can I help you? Is
there anything I can do?

39:32.655 --> 39:35.615
No, you just need to
go, sweetie. I love you.

39:35.615 --> 39:37.255
Where'd all those
pieces come from?

39:37.255 --> 39:38.855
Just all from my box.

39:38.855 --> 39:41.935
I have everything of blue and
everything of white except for one.

39:41.935 --> 39:44.015
I've got to go back to my box.

39:44.015 --> 39:45.695
There's more in there.

39:45.695 --> 39:47.285
Good job, Erin!

39:47.285 --> 39:50.215
Thanks, guys! I
love your parents.

39:55.135 --> 39:57.255
I'm missing a blue.

39:57.255 --> 39:59.135
I'm cold and I'm starving.

39:59.135 --> 40:02.495
At least 40 minutes
wasted looking for pieces.

40:02.495 --> 40:05.095
Come on. Come on.

40:05.095 --> 40:06.495
Oh, my God.

40:10.015 --> 40:11.895
I found a blue piece.

40:11.895 --> 40:14.895
This is for Blair. She doesn't
need to go home 'cause of me.

40:14.895 --> 40:16.765
I do not want to lose this.

40:24.095 --> 40:26.535
Finally. -Shoot!

40:26.535 --> 40:27.935
Mom! Mom!

40:27.935 --> 40:31.215
I'm so sorry.
-Mom, it's OK. We're good.

40:31.215 --> 40:32.895
Hey, good luck!

40:34.055 --> 40:36.055
OK. Here is your clue.

40:36.055 --> 40:37.655
Here he is.

40:37.655 --> 40:39.015
Sorry about that.

40:39.015 --> 40:42.095
You did so good. The
last team just came out.

40:43.495 --> 40:45.535
Right now we're heading
to... -The Pit Stop.

40:45.535 --> 40:48.495
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

40:49.895 --> 40:51.415
This taxidriver is killing it.

40:51.415 --> 40:53.535
Maybe the girls got
in a slower taxi.

40:53.535 --> 40:54.765
You never know.

40:54.765 --> 40:58.095
We're not even driving the speed
limit, but not that we would know

40:58.095 --> 41:01.535
because our cab driver's
speedometer is broken.

41:01.535 --> 41:05.455
We can still win. I'm not ready
to give up. Especially for you.

41:05.455 --> 41:07.095
You know, anything can happen.

41:07.095 --> 41:09.575
We're driving like on
a vacation sightseeing.

41:09.575 --> 41:12.375
10 is just first with a zero.

41:12.375 --> 41:14.255
(LAUGHS) That's right.

41:16.255 --> 41:18.495
Phil! I see him. Yes,
to the right. Follow me.

41:18.495 --> 41:19.575
Alright.

41:19.575 --> 41:21.975
Sheri, you look absolutely
petrified right now.

41:21.975 --> 41:24.415
'Cause I hope the other
team didn't pass us.

41:24.415 --> 41:26.015
You're not 10th.

41:27.095 --> 41:28.495
You're 9th.
-Oh! -Oh, my God!

41:28.495 --> 41:30.175
Hey!

41:30.175 --> 41:33.055
We ended up passing
somebody. Oh! Oh!

41:33.055 --> 41:35.215
Oh, my gosh!
-Oh, my god!

41:35.215 --> 41:37.255
You're good.
-We're good?

41:37.255 --> 41:39.375
Erin and Joslyn, I'm
pleased to tell you

41:39.375 --> 41:40.735
you are still in the race.

41:40.735 --> 41:42.615
You don't have to go home.
You are team number 10.

41:42.615 --> 41:44.695
Are you serious?
-I'm serious, I'm serious.

41:44.695 --> 41:47.215
I love you!

41:47.215 --> 41:49.735
Come on, Daddy. You got this.

41:49.735 --> 41:52.215
Hola. Oh.

41:52.215 --> 41:54.935
Scott and Blair,
Scott and Blair.

41:54.935 --> 41:58.135
I'm very sorry to tell you that
you are the last team to arrive.

41:58.135 --> 41:59.535
OK.

41:59.535 --> 42:01.055
Well, guess what. -What?

42:01.055 --> 42:03.055
You're not eliminated! -Oh!

42:03.055 --> 42:04.615
Oh, my gosh,
that's impossible.

42:04.615 --> 42:10.375
You are still in the race.
This is a non-elimination leg.

42:10.375 --> 42:12.895
Did that feel good?
-I'm so proud of you. Yeah.

42:12.895 --> 42:14.935
You got another leg.
-Bring on that Speed Bump.

42:14.935 --> 42:17.415
You're so positive. -I'm just
happy this isn't the end.

42:17.415 --> 42:20.095
I just want to be able to
go more places with my dad

42:20.095 --> 42:22.655
and, you know, who
knows if we'll be able

42:22.655 --> 42:24.255
to do something
like this again.
