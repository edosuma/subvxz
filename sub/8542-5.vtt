WEBVTT

00:12.273 --> 00:14.362
[seagulls crying,
waves crashing]

00:19.410 --> 00:20.542
Poor girl.

00:20.629 --> 00:21.891
Yeah.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.893
Bruising and abrasions
on the neck suggest

00:23.980 --> 00:25.590
some sort
of physical attack.

00:25.677 --> 00:27.244
That's why
they called us in.

00:27.331 --> 00:30.073
- No clothes, no I.D.?
- Nothing.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.597
Doesn't look like she was
in the water for long.

00:32.684 --> 00:34.643
Contact the coast guards,
see if they've had

00:34.730 --> 00:36.906
any distress calls
or missing person reports.

00:36.993 --> 00:39.778
Yeah.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.911
There's the guy
who found her.

00:41.998 --> 00:44.827
William Gardiner.

00:44.914 --> 00:47.177
He saw the body
from up on the bluff.

00:47.264 --> 00:49.484
- 'Mr. Gardiner?'
- Thank you, sir.

00:49.571 --> 00:51.094
I'm Agent Lisbon.

00:51.181 --> 00:52.617
You wanna tell me
what happened?

00:52.704 --> 00:55.272
I was coming
to check on the monarchs.

00:55.359 --> 00:57.535
Butterflies.
He runs a sanctuary.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.842
I was up there.

00:59.929 --> 01:02.323
Where he's standing,
the man in the suit.

01:11.245 --> 01:12.202
[male #1]
Hey!

01:12.289 --> 01:13.334
[whistles]

01:21.385 --> 01:23.822
- You with the police?
- 'Yes, I am.'

01:23.909 --> 01:25.476
[snorts]

01:28.523 --> 01:29.480
Patrick Jane.

01:29.567 --> 01:31.091
Jed Stack.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.745
This is my land.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.313
Hey, Jed.

01:36.400 --> 01:40.491
There's a dead woman
on the beach in Wracker's Cove.

01:40.578 --> 01:41.666
Yeah.

01:41.753 --> 01:43.320
Well, who is she?

01:43.407 --> 01:45.453
Don't know.

01:45.540 --> 01:46.628
Any idea?

01:46.715 --> 01:48.499
No.

01:48.586 --> 01:49.587
How would I know?

01:49.674 --> 01:52.068
Eh, your land.

01:52.155 --> 01:55.854
I thought
maybe, uh, your body.

01:57.726 --> 01:59.249
That's absurd.

01:59.336 --> 02:01.730
Sorry. I'm just pokin' at ya.
It's often instructive.

02:01.817 --> 02:05.299
Why don't you come meet
my colleagues?

02:05.386 --> 02:07.605
[horse blusters]

02:12.132 --> 02:14.003
This is Jed Stack.

02:14.090 --> 02:15.961
Agent Teresa Lisbon.

02:16.048 --> 02:18.312
Agent Grace Van Pelt.
This is Jed's land.

02:18.399 --> 02:21.141
How do you do, ma'am?
Ma'am.

02:21.228 --> 02:24.013
Mr. Gardiner,
what are you doing here?

02:24.100 --> 02:25.493
I found her.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.495
I was checking
on the monarchs.

02:27.582 --> 02:29.018
Butterflies.

02:29.105 --> 02:30.672
Yes. I saw some.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.500
You were trespassing.

02:32.587 --> 02:35.024
For God sakes, forget about
your property rights for once.

02:35.111 --> 02:36.765
A woman's dead.

02:36.852 --> 02:39.681
The woman's death has nothing
to do with your trespassing.

02:39.768 --> 02:41.596
So she's on your land?

02:41.683 --> 02:45.426
No. Strictly speaking, my land
ends at the high-water mark.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.297
She's on state land.

02:47.384 --> 02:48.690
But given the location

02:48.777 --> 02:52.041
perhaps she's a tenant
or an employee of yours?

02:52.128 --> 02:54.522
I have no tenants,
and I employ no women.

02:54.609 --> 02:57.220
And besides, she was obviously
washed up by the sea.

02:57.307 --> 02:58.961
She must've drifted over
from the mainland

02:59.048 --> 03:00.484
or fell off a ship.

03:00.571 --> 03:03.357
Nothing to do with me
or my ranch or this island.

03:03.444 --> 03:05.620
It seems to make sense.

03:05.707 --> 03:09.101
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stack,
and, uh, butterfly man.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.755
- Gardiner, yeah?
- Yes.

03:10.842 --> 03:12.757
Neither of you were
born here, were you?

03:12.844 --> 03:14.019
No.

03:14.106 --> 03:15.804
What's that got to do
with anything?

03:15.891 --> 03:18.546
Nothing. Just lucky to live
in such a beautiful place.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.595
So, Mr. Stack..

03:38.130 --> 03:40.045
[instrumental music]

03:41.003 --> 03:42.178
[grunts]

03:53.711 --> 03:56.018
Good idea.

03:56.105 --> 03:57.846
We'll see.

04:03.068 --> 04:04.418
Beautiful, isn't it?

04:04.505 --> 04:06.376
For a crime scene. Yeah.

04:09.118 --> 04:12.034
[theme music]

04:17.909 --> 04:19.389
[Cho]
Dental records
just came in.

04:19.476 --> 04:22.262
The victim's Talia Suarez,
19 years old.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.133
Raised in
the foster care system.

04:24.220 --> 04:27.310
Check with family services. Find
out what they know about her.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.443
Rigsby and Van Pelt
are on their way.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.619
Is there anything on
the coast guard front?

04:31.706 --> 04:33.664
They've had no reports
of anyone missing overboard.

04:33.751 --> 04:35.753
What about the mainland
across from the island?

04:35.840 --> 04:38.190
We've got local PD canvassing
all the marinas,

04:38.278 --> 04:40.758
hotels, and motels along that
stretch of coast. Nothing yet.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.760
- Alright. Keep me posted.
- Where are you going?

04:42.847 --> 04:44.588
Back to the island.

04:44.675 --> 04:47.069
The island? Why? If her body
came from the mainland--

04:47.156 --> 04:48.679
Jane's got a theory.

04:48.766 --> 04:49.680
Right.

04:56.252 --> 04:57.209
Ah.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.477
Nice. It's not
what we're looking for.

05:03.564 --> 05:05.479
You could make
a necklace out of it.

05:05.566 --> 05:07.394
I could.

05:07.481 --> 05:11.354
You should. You should have
some kind of restful hobby.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.838
I don't see it.

05:16.925 --> 05:20.189
Hard to believe the moon
causes tides, isn't it?

05:20.276 --> 05:23.758
I mean, we all know it does,
but it just seems so unlikely.

05:23.845 --> 05:26.717
I guess. I've never really
thought about it.

05:26.804 --> 05:28.589
That's 'cause you're
a city girl.

05:28.676 --> 05:29.938
A-ha!

05:31.026 --> 05:33.855
My theory made concrete.

05:33.942 --> 05:34.856
I told you.

05:34.943 --> 05:36.118
Yes, you did.

05:38.294 --> 05:40.514
I thought I saw
a tea shop in town.

05:40.601 --> 05:43.038
I could use a cup of tea.
What about you?

05:43.125 --> 05:44.735
You need a hand with that?

05:44.822 --> 05:46.694
[Patrick]
'I can manage.'

05:59.315 --> 06:01.578
[exhales deeply]

06:07.367 --> 06:08.890
[rattles doorknob]
Uh.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.894
Uh. Well, that's disappointing.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.722
It's closed.

06:14.809 --> 06:17.028
Picturesque, isn't it?

06:17.115 --> 06:20.205
In a desolate sort of way.
Where are all the locals?

06:20.292 --> 06:22.338
Good question.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.209
[cell phone rings]

06:24.296 --> 06:25.776
Cho.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.778
Coroner came back
with a preliminary report.

06:27.865 --> 06:30.085
Larynx was crushed
by a blow or heavy pressure.

06:30.172 --> 06:31.565
'No water in the lungs.'

06:31.652 --> 06:32.696
So she didn't drown.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.176
Dead before she went in.

06:34.263 --> 06:35.786
Also, physical evidence
indicates

06:35.873 --> 06:37.788
she was sexually assaulted
before she was killed.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.311
'Was there any DNA recovered?'

06:39.399 --> 06:41.096
'Yeah, but no matches
in the database.'

06:41.183 --> 06:43.664
Check out the background
of the men on the island.

06:43.751 --> 06:46.797
'See if any of them have
a history of sexual assault.'

06:46.884 --> 06:49.713
See you soon, I hope.

06:52.499 --> 06:55.763
Just like the tea shop.
There's nobody here.

06:55.850 --> 06:58.983
- Where is everybody?
- It's intriguing.

06:59.070 --> 07:01.072
A mass vanishment.

07:01.159 --> 07:02.726
That's not even a word.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.641
Well, it's been known
to happen.

07:04.728 --> 07:07.601
Roanoke colony. The Olmecs.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.516
[Lisbon]
Hello? Hello?

07:09.603 --> 07:11.300
I know where they are,
Lisbon.

07:11.387 --> 07:14.825
I can picture them gathered
together in a dimly lit room

07:14.912 --> 07:17.611
plotting their mysterious
island purpose.

07:17.698 --> 07:19.743
That's really creepy.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.876
Relax.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.838
Talia Suarez. Mm.

07:27.925 --> 07:30.101
Yes, uh, we were hoping
you could tell us--

07:30.188 --> 07:31.668
Murdered, huh?

07:31.755 --> 07:33.670
That's too bad.

07:33.757 --> 07:37.587
But then, deadbeat kids like her
nearly always end up badly.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.459
"Deadbeat kids like her"?

07:39.546 --> 07:43.332
Oh, we see it all the time.
She was sent to us at 6.

07:43.419 --> 07:46.422
Mother died of a drug overdose.
Father murdered.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.555
Oh, and a problem
from the first.

07:48.642 --> 07:51.993
Insubordinate, argumentative,
resistant to authority.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.256
It's a long list.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.040
Pretty girl, looked like.

07:56.127 --> 08:00.088
Vivacious, but no discipline.
No common sense.

08:00.175 --> 08:02.743
What about her foster parents?
Can we talk to them?

08:02.830 --> 08:04.396
Didn't have any.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.921
Kept running away from
the homes we placed her in.

08:07.008 --> 08:09.489
Ended up finishing her time
in a group home.

08:11.099 --> 08:12.927
Can we get that number?

08:13.014 --> 08:16.278
Maybe there are friends
we can talk to.

08:16.365 --> 08:19.368
I'll, uh, see what I can do
and get back to you.

08:19.455 --> 08:23.154
You know, the truth is,
some of them..

08:23.241 --> 08:25.461
[lowered voice]
...you just can't help.

08:25.548 --> 08:26.897
[clicks]

08:26.984 --> 08:28.595
[dials]

08:30.248 --> 08:32.947
Thanks for your time.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.339
Hey.

08:36.907 --> 08:39.083
You know we're never gonna
hear from her again.

08:39.170 --> 08:41.390
Not since you knocked
her coffee over her desk.

08:41.477 --> 08:43.435
She wasn't gonna
do anything to help us.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.742
It's a tough job.
Maybe she's doing her best.

08:45.829 --> 08:49.050
She puts in her 20 so she
gets her pension. Pisses me off.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.791
- I noticed.
- I do my job.

08:50.878 --> 08:53.315
You don't hear me complain.
Why can't others do theirs

08:53.402 --> 08:55.360
so maybe a kid
doesn't have to die.

08:55.447 --> 08:56.884
Alright. I'll drive.
Gimme the keys.

08:56.971 --> 08:58.233
That's alright.
I wanna drive.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.278
I don't think so.
Give me the keys.

09:00.365 --> 09:01.802
- What's with you?
- You're worked up.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.107
I should drive,
so gimme--

09:03.194 --> 09:04.935
- Cut it out..
- Give me the keys.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.981
- Come on. Just--
- What's the matter with you?

09:09.157 --> 09:11.638
Okay. No problem. You drive.

09:20.298 --> 09:24.912
Now two additional
ferry crossings a weekend

09:24.999 --> 09:30.395
during the summer months
equals a 35% increase

09:30.482 --> 09:32.528
in revenues projected.

09:32.615 --> 09:35.052
Now, I don't understand
how anyone can be against that.

09:35.139 --> 09:36.706
The runoff from Stack's
cattle ranch

09:36.793 --> 09:39.230
is already affecting
the groundwater pH balance.

09:39.317 --> 09:41.276
- Another thing that you--
- Point of order, chair.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.104
- I had the floor.
- Oh, now, Peter.

09:43.191 --> 09:46.150
- Let's not be so fussy.
- Excuse me for interrupting.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.500
I'm agent Teresa Lisbon
from the CBI.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.068
And this is my colleague,
Patrick Jane.

09:51.155 --> 09:53.593
I'm sorry, but we're
in the middle of a meeting.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.595
- Can you come back later?
- No, we can't.

09:55.682 --> 09:56.900
A woman was murdered here.

09:56.987 --> 09:59.207
We're here to discover
who did it and why.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.688
Her name was Talia Suarez.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.733
Can any of you
remember seeing her?

10:03.820 --> 10:05.082
[Peter]
- 'Sir.'
- Mm?

10:05.169 --> 10:07.432
- Wasn't she found on the beach?
- Yes.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.260
Well, I mean,
that would indicate

10:09.347 --> 10:11.785
that the tide, uh,
brought her in, surely.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.569
That's mainland business.

10:13.656 --> 10:16.485
Yes, we have nothing to do
with happens on the mainland.

10:16.572 --> 10:19.053
Messy place, the mainland.
That's why you're all here.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.838
To escape from all that,
and of course, she's from there

10:21.925 --> 10:23.623
because no one here
knows her, right?

10:23.710 --> 10:24.841
That's right.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.974
There's a lot of flotsam
that washes up

10:27.061 --> 10:29.019
on San Felix all the time,
doesn't it?

10:29.106 --> 10:30.717
- Certainly.
- Mm-hmm.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.763
Summer weekends, the harbor
gets all sorts of trash.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.896
[sighs]
Especially after storms, yes.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.985
Excuse me. If you would?
Thank you.

10:38.072 --> 10:41.684
So here's your island. It's a
beautiful island, I must say.

10:41.771 --> 10:45.122
Here's your harbor, on the
leeward side of the island

10:45.209 --> 10:47.821
closest to the mainland coast.

10:47.908 --> 10:50.954
And the body was found
in Wracker's Cove

10:51.041 --> 10:54.001
which is here, I believe.

10:54.088 --> 10:57.047
On the western side of
the island.

10:57.134 --> 11:00.529
The furthest side
from the mainland coast.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.662
Now, I would think
it would be difficult

11:02.749 --> 11:05.534
for a body to drift from here
against the currents

11:05.621 --> 11:08.058
and the prevailing winds,
to here.

11:08.145 --> 11:09.843
Another compelling fact.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.715
If you throw something
into the water in Wracker's Cove

11:12.802 --> 11:15.413
it will drift out
to sea for a bit.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.721
And then, it will come
back to shore.

11:18.808 --> 11:21.071
I checked with this.

11:23.073 --> 11:26.424
Talia Suarez died here.

11:26.511 --> 11:28.209
So look to your neighbor
and think

11:28.296 --> 11:30.733
'how well do you know them?'

11:30.820 --> 11:34.998
Because someone on this island
committed murder.

11:35.085 --> 11:36.260
[crowd murmuring]

11:36.347 --> 11:37.784
We'll be back.

11:39.568 --> 11:42.484
[crowd murmuring]

11:50.187 --> 11:52.233
I've been doing my best to track
Talia after leaving foster care.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.539
- And? Anything useful?
- A series of minimum wage jobs.

11:54.626 --> 11:57.107
She never stayed longer
than six weeks at any one.

11:57.194 --> 11:59.109
- Moved all over the state.
- What else? Friends?

11:59.196 --> 12:00.894
- Acquaintances?
- Nothing yet.

12:00.981 --> 12:03.679
I talked to employers.
They say she was a good worker.

12:03.766 --> 12:06.247
- Kept to herself.
- What about family services?

12:06.334 --> 12:08.075
They're no help either.
It's sad, boss.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.120
We're the only ones
that care about her.

12:10.207 --> 12:12.035
Keep looking.

12:12.122 --> 12:14.821
There's footage of her getting
on the ferry to San Felix.

12:14.908 --> 12:17.127
- No camera on the island side.
- Uh, what's this?

12:17.214 --> 12:18.868
Police sent it over.
Talia's room.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.217
Beachfront motel
on the coast

12:20.304 --> 12:22.350
'across the strait
from San Felix.'

12:22.437 --> 12:24.221
Toothbrush, toothpaste,
a change of clothes?

12:24.308 --> 12:25.657
That's it?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.834
- That and a notebook.
- What notebook?

12:27.921 --> 12:28.965
Jane's got it.

12:32.099 --> 12:35.058
It's a diary of sorts. She wrote
letters to her dead parents.

12:35.145 --> 12:36.712
That's sad.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.497
Then there's this, I found
tucked away in the back pages.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.412
"San Felix fish." Mm.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.681
Does this seem
too easy to you?

12:49.769 --> 12:52.772
Only one way to find out.

13:01.258 --> 13:02.825
Who's in charge here?

13:02.912 --> 13:04.348
We ain't open to tourists.

13:04.435 --> 13:07.003
[sniffs]
Crab.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.179
You can't be out here
for safety reasons.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.703
We're with the California Bureau
of Investigation.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.967
We need to ask you some
questions, mister...

13:14.054 --> 13:16.796
Lafleur. Jack Lafleur.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.536
So what's this all about?

13:18.623 --> 13:22.192
I don't think you're gonna want
to talk to us out here, jack.

13:22.279 --> 13:24.760
Uh, is there somewhere
a little more private?

13:26.457 --> 13:29.112
Get back to work.

13:29.199 --> 13:31.071
Let's go to my office.

13:37.991 --> 13:40.820
So what's this all about?

13:40.907 --> 13:43.692
Tell me about Talia Suarez.

13:43.779 --> 13:46.608
What? Who's Talia Suarez?

13:46.695 --> 13:48.740
The girl we found murdered
in Wracker's Cove.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.568
What's that got to do
with me?

13:50.655 --> 13:52.657
We found this in her diary.

13:54.616 --> 13:56.183
That doesn't make any sense.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.359
Ah, there we are.

13:58.446 --> 14:00.491
Hey, hey. Those are mine.

14:00.578 --> 14:03.016
[papers rustling]

14:03.103 --> 14:05.018
This is impressive.
Is that a new dock?

14:05.105 --> 14:07.150
No, uh, a pier. Wait.
A wharf.

14:07.237 --> 14:08.935
Would you call
that a wharf?

14:09.587 --> 14:11.676
It's big.

14:11.763 --> 14:14.244
I'm expanding my business.
I need more room.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.295
Look, I got no idea why
some girl wrote

14:21.382 --> 14:23.906
whatever she wrote,
but I never heard of her.

14:23.993 --> 14:26.126
You're barking up
the wrong tree.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.215
Maybe it was somebody
who works for you.

14:28.302 --> 14:31.522
We've been out at sea for the
past week. We just got back.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.873
I told you,
it doesn't make sense.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.311
Even if this girl of yours did
come here, we were all gone.

14:37.398 --> 14:39.443
Your murder's got nothing
to do with us.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.319
It's a pretty airtight alibi.

14:45.406 --> 14:47.408
Yeah. Dock's interesting,
though.

14:47.495 --> 14:49.149
It is?

14:49.236 --> 14:51.716
Well, the Pacific Ocean's
been horribly overfished.

14:51.803 --> 14:54.589
No fisherman these days needs
to build a larger dock.

14:54.676 --> 14:57.244
You think that has something
to do with the murder?

14:57.331 --> 14:59.159
Yes. No.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.030
Not necessarily, no. Maybe.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.423
I just think
it's interesting.

15:02.510 --> 15:04.904
Or not. Let's go talk
to the rancher.

15:08.255 --> 15:10.170
[Lisbon]
Whoever put Talia Suarez
in that cove

15:10.257 --> 15:12.389
had to have carried her
across your property.

15:12.476 --> 15:15.740
[Jed]
'My ranch is 300 acres, and
Wrackers cove's on the far end.'

15:15.827 --> 15:19.092
You could carry a passel load of
bodies without anybody knowing.

15:19.179 --> 15:22.008
What brought you to the island?
Who are you running from?

15:22.095 --> 15:23.748
- What?
- Mm?

15:23.835 --> 15:25.402
I wasn't running
from anybody.

15:25.489 --> 15:28.231
Only I look around this room,
I see horses and cows

15:28.318 --> 15:30.581
but I don't see
any friends or family.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.888
No kids. No sweethearts.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.455
[sighs]
I like horses.

15:34.542 --> 15:38.198
Ah. You're a homely
but passionate man.

15:38.285 --> 15:40.243
So my guess is,
your heart was broken

15:40.330 --> 15:45.161
by a beautiful but cruel
and faithless woman.

15:45.248 --> 15:47.163
30 years ago.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.687
What the hell's that got
to do with this girl?

15:49.774 --> 15:51.559
Probably nothing.
What's your position

15:51.646 --> 15:53.865
on the increased ferry service?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.476
[chuckles]

15:55.563 --> 15:57.608
You're pokin'
at me again, huh?

15:58.696 --> 16:00.176
I'll tell you my position.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.439
Of course, we need
more ferry service.

16:02.526 --> 16:05.051
These islanders got
no business sense at all.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.704
Not even Jack Lafleur?

16:06.791 --> 16:09.533
He struck me as someone that
knows how to do business.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.492
[chuckles]
Oh, he did, did he?

16:13.102 --> 16:14.843
Mr. Stack.

16:14.930 --> 16:18.455
Don't mind my asking, but where
were you the night before last?

16:18.542 --> 16:20.327
Just like always,
right here.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.111
Is there anyone
who can verify that?

16:22.198 --> 16:23.591
Sure. My ranch hands.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.114
Can we talk to them?

16:25.201 --> 16:27.247
Sure, you can.
They're in the corral.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.553
Jane, we'd better--

16:32.252 --> 16:34.994
Why don't you lead the way,
Mr. Stack?

16:35.081 --> 16:36.125
[sighs]

16:46.701 --> 16:49.051
Watch he doesn't kick.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.793
What happened to you?

16:51.880 --> 16:52.881
Horse did.

16:52.968 --> 16:54.709
Oh.

16:54.796 --> 16:57.407
We were culling steer.
Had about 40 head of cattle.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.018
39 head.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.107
- I said "about."
- No such thing as "about."

17:01.194 --> 17:03.718
Either you got 40 head,
or you got 39 head.

17:03.805 --> 17:06.808
Whit would correct the good lord
if he got the count wrong.

17:06.895 --> 17:09.115
We were taking 'em up
to the south pasture.

17:09.202 --> 17:12.161
One got spooked, went over
the side, and took me with it.

17:12.248 --> 17:14.250
I don't know what made
Whit holler more.

17:14.337 --> 17:17.558
A horse rolling over him or
going to the mainland to set it.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.516
- Shut up.
- You don't like the mainland?

17:19.603 --> 17:21.301
Or you don't like
the ferryboat ride?

17:21.388 --> 17:22.911
Neither. I like it here.

17:22.998 --> 17:24.173
Why?

17:24.260 --> 17:25.261
It's quiet.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.046
Yeah.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.700
Seems, uh, old man Stack
feels the same way, huh?

17:29.787 --> 17:33.791
Listen, between you and me...

17:33.878 --> 17:36.620
this whole cowboy thing is
an act with Stack, isn't it?

17:36.707 --> 17:38.144
I mean, he's all hat

17:38.231 --> 17:40.059
and, uh, no stirrups,
as you say?

17:40.146 --> 17:42.191
It's all hat
and no cattle.

17:42.278 --> 17:44.280
- What-what is it?
- All hat and no cattle.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.326
That's what you call
a man like that.

17:46.413 --> 17:47.892
[Jed]
'A man like what?'

17:47.979 --> 17:50.852
Oh, I was just asking about
old, uh, cowboy sayings.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.333
Whit was just correcting him.
Weren't you, whit?

17:53.420 --> 17:55.378
If you'll excuse me,
I gotta take care

17:55.465 --> 17:57.641
of something in the barn.

17:57.728 --> 18:00.166
Sure. Thanks, whit.

18:03.212 --> 18:06.128
Fella's a bit shy,
but, uh, he's a good worker.

18:06.215 --> 18:08.174
- I'd like to interview him.
- No need, Lisbon.

18:08.261 --> 18:10.741
I've already spoken to, uh,
Mr. Stack's workforce here.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.526
We should leave. Thank you.

18:12.613 --> 18:15.529
Where were the three of you
the night before last?

18:15.616 --> 18:17.618
Here. Like always.

18:17.705 --> 18:20.621
Okay. We can go now.
Thank you for your time.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.231
We'll be in touch.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.103
[cell phone rings]

18:25.539 --> 18:26.627
Lisbon.

18:26.714 --> 18:28.455
We got a break
in the case.

18:28.542 --> 18:31.284
A series of incoming calls
to Talia Suarez's motel.

18:31.371 --> 18:34.330
All from a cell phone registered
to a guy named Dennis Kagan.

18:34.417 --> 18:35.505
Who's Dennis Kagan?

18:35.592 --> 18:36.811
'An ex-foster kid who shared'

18:36.898 --> 18:38.639
a couple of group homes
with Talia.

18:38.726 --> 18:41.381
The last call came within a
10-mile radius of Talia's motel.

18:41.468 --> 18:42.686
'Sounds interesting.'

18:42.773 --> 18:44.645
Yeah, especially since
Kagan lives

18:44.732 --> 18:46.212
100 miles Southwest
of the motel.

18:46.299 --> 18:47.822
Are we bringing him in?

18:47.909 --> 18:50.564
Van Pelt and Cho are gonna
pick him up right now.

18:53.784 --> 18:56.744
This is the address.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.485
Apartment's
on the second floor.

18:58.572 --> 19:01.923
- You get a picture of Kagan?
- Yeah, from the DMV.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.142
Here.

19:05.927 --> 19:06.971
'That's him.'

19:07.058 --> 19:08.016
Yeah.

19:08.103 --> 19:09.626
Okay. Let's go.

19:13.587 --> 19:14.631
I'll take lead.

19:14.718 --> 19:17.243
Got it.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.897
Hey. Dennis, right?
You Dennis Kagan?

19:21.812 --> 19:23.205
Maybe.

19:23.292 --> 19:24.946
You're friends
with Talia Suarez, right?

19:25.033 --> 19:26.991
I don't know the name, man.
Keep walkin'.

19:27.078 --> 19:29.516
- I think you do know.
- Hey, get off me, bitch.

19:29.603 --> 19:31.561
Stay right there.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.389
- You're under arrest.
- Uhh!

19:33.476 --> 19:34.912
Put your hands
behind your back...

19:34.999 --> 19:36.523
Get off.

19:36.610 --> 19:39.090
O-okay. I'll take it from here.
Come on. Come on.

19:52.756 --> 19:55.716
[sighs]

19:55.803 --> 19:59.937
It'd be better for you
if you talked to me, Dennis.

20:00.024 --> 20:01.983
You're already looking
at assaulting a police officer.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.811
Don't make it harder
on yourself.

20:03.898 --> 20:06.683
Look, I told you
I want a lawyer.

20:06.770 --> 20:09.164
One's on the way from
the Public Defender's office.

20:09.251 --> 20:11.949
I just wanna give you
a chance to work with us.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.908
Earn yourself
some goodwill.

20:16.519 --> 20:19.261
Hey, it's up to you
how you want to play it.

20:19.348 --> 20:21.350
A lawyer, that's how.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.571
Alright.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.529
Have it your way.

20:28.879 --> 20:29.924
[elevator bell dings]

20:31.665 --> 20:33.841
Hi. You must be from
the public defenders office.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.321
I'm agent Grace Van Pelt.

20:35.408 --> 20:38.149
Grace. Oh. Hi. Right.
Nice to meet you.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.455
I'm Sarah Harrigan.

20:39.542 --> 20:42.502
- Do we know each other?
- No. Um, I j--

20:42.589 --> 20:45.069
Last year there was
a murder at a dating service

20:45.156 --> 20:46.854
and you guys
interviewed me.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.377
Don't worry.
I didn't do it.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.336
[laughing]

20:52.207 --> 20:54.427
Hey, Cho. This is Sarah Harrigan

20:54.514 --> 20:55.776
from the Public Defender's
office.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.212
- Hey.
- Hello, Agent..

20:57.299 --> 20:58.866
Hey, guys. I can handle this.

20:58.953 --> 21:01.564
Sarah, let me bring you
to your client.

21:05.089 --> 21:07.527
- Did that feel weird to you?
- Yeah, a little bit.

21:07.614 --> 21:10.486
Really? What was that all about?

21:10.573 --> 21:12.749
Well, it seems obvious.
They're dating.

21:18.581 --> 21:20.844
So, Dennis,
you've got your lawyer.

21:20.931 --> 21:24.152
- Let's talk.
- I've spoken with my client.

21:24.239 --> 21:26.894
He's willing to help you,
with some stipulations.

21:26.981 --> 21:29.070
We're not making any deals.

21:31.551 --> 21:32.682
[Sarah]
'Go ahead.'

21:32.769 --> 21:35.424
Look, Talia was looking
for the guy

21:35.511 --> 21:37.339
that killed her dad.

21:37.426 --> 21:39.385
'Cause the damn cops
didn't do their job.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.648
My client is speaking
from a place of emotion.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.302
- Means no disrespect.
- They didn't.

21:43.389 --> 21:44.868
They knew who did the murder

21:44.955 --> 21:46.870
and they never bothered
to find him.

21:46.957 --> 21:50.265
And this suspect..

21:50.352 --> 21:51.788
You ever hear his name?

21:51.875 --> 21:53.224
Uh..

21:53.312 --> 21:55.009
...I'm trying to remember.

21:55.096 --> 21:56.750
[sighing]
A funny name

21:56.837 --> 21:59.230
like, uh, Tommy Tuna
or something like that.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.320
[sighing]
Fish?

22:01.407 --> 22:03.496
Yeah. That's the guy.

22:03.583 --> 22:07.500
Uh, Edward Fish.
It was Edward Fish. Yeah.

22:09.110 --> 22:11.808
So you went to her motel.
Why?

22:11.895 --> 22:13.462
[sighing]

22:13.549 --> 22:15.986
'Cause I wanted
to stop her, you know?

22:16.073 --> 22:18.032
Look, what Talia was doing
was dangerous, okay?

22:18.119 --> 22:21.122
She liked to act tough,
but she wasn't, really.

22:22.471 --> 22:25.344
She had my back
in the homes.

22:27.694 --> 22:30.261
I should have had hers..

22:32.742 --> 22:34.701
...but I was too late.

22:40.576 --> 22:42.404
There you are.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.406
Oh, thank you very much.

22:44.493 --> 22:46.234
That looks delicious.
Did you make that?

22:46.321 --> 22:48.279
Mm-hmm.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.892
What do you know about this,
uh, rancher, Stack?

22:51.979 --> 22:54.416
They keep to themselves,
mostly.

22:54.503 --> 22:56.375
He seems like a polite man.

22:58.594 --> 23:01.249
That's delicious.

23:01.336 --> 23:03.599
I thought about
what you said this morning.

23:08.343 --> 23:11.477
You made me feel rather guilty
about that poor girl.

23:11.564 --> 23:14.044
Oh. I'm-I'm sorry. I don't want
anyone to feel guilty

23:14.131 --> 23:15.872
unless, of course,
they are.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.265
Are you?

23:17.352 --> 23:18.571
[chuckling]
Oh, no.

23:18.658 --> 23:21.095
No. I thought not.

23:21.182 --> 23:24.490
I threw a flower
into the ocean for her.

23:24.577 --> 23:25.839
You did?

23:25.926 --> 23:28.624
It's an old island custom.

23:28.711 --> 23:30.409
'My mother said
it sent a message'

23:30.496 --> 23:33.020
to your people
who had passed over.

23:33.107 --> 23:35.501
I mean, I know
the girl isn't my family

23:35.588 --> 23:39.026
but I think it'll
still work, don't you?

23:39.113 --> 23:41.811
Well, it can't hurt.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.683
[chuckling]

23:43.770 --> 23:46.642
You think
I'm a foolish old woman

23:46.729 --> 23:47.948
but I'll tell you this.

23:48.035 --> 23:49.166
[cellphone ringing]

23:49.253 --> 23:50.994
I feel better.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.561
[ringing continues]

23:52.648 --> 23:54.433
I feel like I did..

23:54.520 --> 23:56.783
...something to give
that girl some peace.

23:56.870 --> 23:58.741
[ringing continues]

24:01.004 --> 24:03.398
[ringing continues]

24:03.485 --> 24:06.314
Lisbon, you're calling
to tell me that

24:06.401 --> 24:08.142
the, uh, person of interest
you're following

24:08.229 --> 24:09.578
is not the murderer.

24:09.665 --> 24:12.363
No, but he told us
what Talia was looking for.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.930
Oh?

24:14.017 --> 24:17.151
She was looking for her father's
murderer, Edward Fish.

24:17.238 --> 24:18.587
Hmm.

24:18.674 --> 24:20.197
'Yeah, you'd better
get back here.'

24:20.284 --> 24:22.025
Excuse me, Agent Lisbon.
A word?

24:22.112 --> 24:24.071
- Uh..
- Hmm.

24:24.158 --> 24:26.377
You sound busy, Lisbon,
so don't worry about me.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.032
I know exactly what to do.
Bye.

24:29.119 --> 24:30.120
[sighing]

24:30.207 --> 24:31.295
[receiver clattering]

24:31.382 --> 24:32.558
Yes, counselor?

24:32.645 --> 24:35.212
Yeah,
my client Dennis Kagan..

24:35.299 --> 24:37.171
You are dropping
all charges, I assume

24:37.258 --> 24:39.086
since he's been
such a cooperative witness?

24:39.173 --> 24:41.349
And I've got an agent
with cuts and bruises

24:41.436 --> 24:43.046
as a result
of your client.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.874
And I've got assault

24:44.961 --> 24:46.963
failure to identify,
and excessive force.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.791
Do we really want
to go there

24:48.878 --> 24:50.576
given where your guys
have been already?

24:50.663 --> 24:55.058
It'll never hold up in court,
and you know it, but okay.

24:55.145 --> 24:56.364
Oh, fantastic.

24:56.451 --> 24:59.062
You're meaner
than you look.

24:59.149 --> 25:00.586
Yeah, you are.

25:00.673 --> 25:02.979
[chuckling]
Oh, I try.

25:06.243 --> 25:09.029
- We're still on for tonight?
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Okay.

25:11.858 --> 25:15.383
I'm gonna research
the dad's murder.

25:15.470 --> 25:16.645
Good idea.

25:20.040 --> 25:23.783
[telephone rings,
police radio chatter]

25:23.870 --> 25:25.915
[ring]

25:26.002 --> 25:27.613
hey, boss.

25:27.700 --> 25:30.703
I just made a new pot.
You want a cup?

25:30.790 --> 25:32.052
No.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.662
It's funny
you should mention coffee

25:33.749 --> 25:36.186
because I got off the phone
with a social worker

25:36.273 --> 25:39.538
who claims one of my agents
threw a cup of it at her.

25:39.625 --> 25:42.062
What? It spilled on her desk
as we were leaving.

25:42.149 --> 25:43.629
Didn't even get on her.

25:43.716 --> 25:44.934
Sure you don't want any?

25:45.021 --> 25:46.283
Tell me what's going on

25:46.370 --> 25:48.329
whether or not I can
count on you.

25:48.416 --> 25:51.245
Of course you can.
Why would you even ask me that?

25:51.332 --> 25:53.595
Because right before I spoke
to the social worker

25:53.682 --> 25:55.379
a lawyer from
the public defenders office

25:55.466 --> 25:58.339
threatened to bring you up
on charges of excessive force.

25:58.426 --> 26:00.646
- I'd to cut her client loose.
- You did what?

26:00.733 --> 26:03.692
I'm the one with the busted lip.
He didn't have a mark.

26:03.779 --> 26:05.651
You didn't touch him?

26:08.001 --> 26:10.612
Boss, come on.

26:10.699 --> 26:13.223
So you're telling me that
even though I've gotten

26:13.310 --> 26:15.748
two complaints about you
within the space of an hour

26:15.835 --> 26:17.706
that there's nothing
going on?

26:17.793 --> 26:18.968
You're fine?

26:19.055 --> 26:21.188
Yeah, that's what
I'm saying.

26:21.275 --> 26:24.800
Okay. Look, I know
it's been a tough year.

26:24.887 --> 26:28.369
We've got a new boss.
We're under a lot of scrutiny.

26:28.456 --> 26:32.025
It's really important that
we make a good impression.

26:32.112 --> 26:35.245
- Do you understand?
- I didn't do anything wrong.

26:35.332 --> 26:37.378
Grace.

26:37.465 --> 26:40.294
As a friend, should I be
worried about you?

26:40.381 --> 26:41.600
I'm fine.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.123
The social worker's
just pissed off

26:43.210 --> 26:45.647
that somebody was trying
to make her do her job

26:45.734 --> 26:47.431
and the kid got
out of line.

26:47.518 --> 26:48.781
It's not a big deal.

26:48.868 --> 26:52.219
- The lawyer'd have had no case.
- Alright.

26:52.306 --> 26:54.264
Well, as your boss,
any more of this

26:54.351 --> 26:56.440
and we've got
a serious problem.

26:56.527 --> 26:58.747
Got it.

26:58.834 --> 27:01.141
[police radio chatter]

27:01.228 --> 27:04.100
[birds chirping]

27:20.464 --> 27:22.379
Hi.

27:22.466 --> 27:24.904
Hello.

27:24.991 --> 27:26.862
Mr. Jane, right?

27:26.949 --> 27:28.864
That's right.

27:28.951 --> 27:31.780
Wow. This place is amazing.
Did you do this all yourself?

27:34.304 --> 27:37.307
No. The monarchs do
most of it.

27:37.394 --> 27:39.875
I just try to make their journey
a little easier.

27:39.962 --> 27:43.444
And that's, uh, because insects
deserve a better life?

27:43.531 --> 27:46.621
I know. It's a foolish
obsession, isn't it?

27:46.708 --> 27:49.406
I often wonder..

27:49.493 --> 27:52.061
...why I do it,
but here I am.

27:52.148 --> 27:54.194
Here you are.

27:54.281 --> 27:57.284
But if the cruise ships make
this island a port of call

27:57.371 --> 27:59.329
'this could be a wonderful
tourist attraction.'

27:59.416 --> 28:01.505
You could make yourself
a lot of money.

28:01.592 --> 28:03.507
Cruise ships?
What are you talking about?

28:03.594 --> 28:05.379
Oh, Jack Lafleur..
Do you know him?

28:05.466 --> 28:07.163
The fisherman, yeah.

28:07.250 --> 28:10.906
Yeah, well, apparently
he's, uh, rebuilding his jetty

28:10.993 --> 28:13.822
into, uh, a pier or a wharf,
whichever's bigger.

28:16.085 --> 28:18.566
Why would he do that?
Where'd he get the money?

28:18.653 --> 28:20.002
Well,
I'm not entirely sure

28:20.089 --> 28:22.309
but, uh, I think the money's
coming from stack.

28:22.396 --> 28:25.616
I think the idea is to lure
cruise ships, uh, to the island.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.531
Oh, my god.

28:27.618 --> 28:30.230
I have to make some calls
to the coastal commission.

28:30.317 --> 28:32.536
Um, there's gotta be a way
to stop this.

28:32.623 --> 28:35.496
I suggest the, uh,
Sierra Club, too.

28:38.064 --> 28:40.153
[knock on door]

28:40.240 --> 28:42.851
What's up?

28:42.938 --> 28:44.548
Winston Suarez..
Talia's dad.

28:44.635 --> 28:46.812
Worked as a night guard
in a construction business

28:46.899 --> 28:48.596
near Modesto

28:48.683 --> 28:51.686
and this is the guy
who killed him..

28:51.773 --> 28:55.298
...Edward William Fish,
A.K.A. Eddy Fish.

28:55.385 --> 28:56.909
Nothing to do
with Jack Lafleur.

28:56.996 --> 28:59.041
So Talia went to go
and find Fish

28:59.128 --> 29:00.869
and he killed her
when she did?

29:00.956 --> 29:04.220
Uh, what about the rape?
Does that fit in with his MO?

29:04.307 --> 29:06.701
Fish was a crackhead who stabbed
Winston Suarez 18 times

29:06.788 --> 29:08.268
when he tried to stop Fish

29:08.355 --> 29:09.617
from robbing
the construction company.

29:09.704 --> 29:11.097
That's a lot of blood.

29:11.184 --> 29:12.838
Fish disappeared
with over 300 grand.

29:12.925 --> 29:15.362
Cops never found him.
Assumption is he used the money

29:15.449 --> 29:16.885
to change his appearance
and identity.

29:16.972 --> 29:18.452
What's the connection
to San Felix?

29:18.539 --> 29:20.280
Talia found
the case file.

29:20.367 --> 29:23.196
San Felix's mentioned
as an early lead.

29:23.283 --> 29:25.067
Alright. Thanks.

29:27.548 --> 29:29.463
- Jane.
- 'Hey, Lisbon.'

29:29.550 --> 29:32.161
I'm just putting some of the
finishing touches in place.

29:32.248 --> 29:33.467
'You be careful.'

29:33.554 --> 29:35.512
This Eddy Fish
is a dangerous man.

29:35.599 --> 29:37.776
He stabbed Talia's father
18 times.

29:37.863 --> 29:40.039
It's a good thing
we're about to catch him.

29:40.126 --> 29:42.476
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

29:42.563 --> 29:45.131
[chuckling]
If he's on this island, Lisbon

29:45.218 --> 29:47.133
he will reveal
himself to us.

29:47.220 --> 29:48.699
Hang on.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.789
Interesting, huh, guys?

29:50.876 --> 29:53.269
Oh, did...did you hear
about what's happening

29:53.356 --> 29:54.749
with Stack and Gardiner?

29:54.836 --> 29:56.098
What?

29:56.185 --> 29:57.665
Stack has been working
with Lafleur

29:57.752 --> 30:00.102
to try to bring cruise ships
into the harbor.

30:00.189 --> 30:01.800
- Cruise ships?
- Here?

30:01.887 --> 30:03.323
Yeah, and then Gardiner
found out

30:03.410 --> 30:05.194
and he's vowed to stop it
immediately.

30:05.281 --> 30:06.761
What?

30:06.848 --> 30:09.111
We've got to call
a town meeting right away.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.637
Better hurry, Lisbon.
You'll miss all the fun.

30:13.724 --> 30:15.596
I've practically got
the killer in handcuffs.

30:25.171 --> 30:28.348
[indistinct conversation]

30:28.435 --> 30:31.133
[Jack]
What business does anybody
have to do with my dock?

30:31.220 --> 30:33.179
Well, now as a community,
it's everyone's concern..

30:33.266 --> 30:35.442
I-I know this island's
a jewel in the rough.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.226
I'm just lookin'
to polish it up.

30:37.313 --> 30:39.141
No, listen,
the environmental danger

30:39.228 --> 30:41.883
of ferry service pales in
comparison to cruise ships!

30:41.970 --> 30:45.147
The chair has not recognized
Mr. Gardiner.

30:45.234 --> 30:48.107
[Patrick]
Ladies and gentlemen,
sorry for the interruption.

30:48.194 --> 30:49.630
'This is a top priority.'

30:49.717 --> 30:51.850
I'm here with the CBI.
It's okay.

30:51.937 --> 30:54.330
Everything is completely
under control.

30:54.417 --> 30:58.160
I'm gonna need you to follow
my instructions to the letter.

30:58.247 --> 31:02.034
Listen to everything I say
very carefully.

31:02.121 --> 31:06.734
The first thing I need you to do
is to place your coffee cups

31:06.821 --> 31:09.084
on those two tables
back there.

31:09.171 --> 31:11.826
All of you, your coffee cups
on the table back there.

31:11.913 --> 31:13.480
[singsong voice]
For this to work

31:13.567 --> 31:16.004
you're gonna have to listen
and do as you're told.

31:16.091 --> 31:17.788
[normal voice]
Thank you.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.791
Your coffee cups on the table.
This is a serious matter.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.141
[indistinct conversation]

31:22.228 --> 31:23.751
'You too, please.
Thank you.'

31:23.838 --> 31:26.058
'And then return
to your seats..'

31:26.145 --> 31:29.844
...as quickly
and efficiently..

31:29.931 --> 31:32.238
...as you can.

31:34.327 --> 31:36.024
'Thank you.'

31:37.112 --> 31:39.027
Okay. That wasn't so bad.

31:39.114 --> 31:41.769
We've tracked the killer
to this island.

31:41.856 --> 31:42.988
[woman #1]
'The killer's here?'

31:43.075 --> 31:44.380
Yes.

31:44.467 --> 31:47.340
He's here in this room
right now.

31:51.692 --> 31:54.913
His name is Eddy Fish.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.175
[crowd murmuring]

31:56.262 --> 31:59.352
I don't know which one
of you that is

31:59.439 --> 32:02.485
but you killed
Talia Suarez's father.

32:02.572 --> 32:04.923
That's why she came here..
To find you.

32:07.577 --> 32:09.362
Now I'm here..

32:09.449 --> 32:12.539
'...to finish off
what Talia started.'

32:12.626 --> 32:14.541
'Yes.'

32:14.628 --> 32:16.369
[clearing throat]

32:19.720 --> 32:21.504
To catch Eddy Fish.

32:27.989 --> 32:31.688
- What are you going to do?
- Me?

32:31.775 --> 32:33.429
Nothing.
It's already done.

32:33.516 --> 32:36.258
The fingerprints on the cups..

32:36.345 --> 32:37.738
[man #1]
What? No way.

32:37.825 --> 32:39.740
...match them
to the original crime scene.

32:39.827 --> 32:41.698
[indistinct conversation]

32:46.355 --> 32:49.271
- Is that legal?
- N-no, I want my cup back.

32:49.358 --> 32:51.534
Don't worry. I'm gonna get
a camera to document

32:51.621 --> 32:54.189
everything they're doing.
We have rights.

32:54.276 --> 32:56.713
I don't know why you're
all getting so worked up.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.367
Only one of you is guilty.

32:58.454 --> 33:00.674
The rest of you should
just sit back, relax

33:00.761 --> 33:02.632
'have another piece of cake.'

33:07.637 --> 33:09.813
Am I the only one thinking
that's the last

33:09.900 --> 33:11.815
we'll see of Mr. Gardiner?

33:23.610 --> 33:26.004
[starting motor]

33:44.152 --> 33:46.024
You going somewhere,
Mr. Gardiner?

33:48.678 --> 33:50.332
[grunting]
Aah!

33:50.419 --> 33:52.508
No! Let go of me!
I'll kill you!

33:52.595 --> 33:54.075
[grunting]

33:54.162 --> 33:56.121
Eddy Fish, you're under
arrest for the murders

33:56.208 --> 33:57.687
of Winston Suarez
and Talia Suarez.

33:57.774 --> 33:58.993
[grunting and panting]

33:59.080 --> 34:00.603
You've the right
to remain silent.

34:00.690 --> 34:03.954
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.000
You've the right
to speak to an attorney.

34:06.087 --> 34:07.523
If you cannot afford
an attorney

34:07.610 --> 34:09.047
one will be appointed
to you.

34:09.134 --> 34:10.874
I didn't know who she was.

34:10.961 --> 34:13.703
I didn't kill her!
I never even saw the girl.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.749
I didn't know
she was on the island.

34:15.836 --> 34:17.707
[indistinct conversation]

34:22.190 --> 34:23.496
Who'd have thought?

34:23.583 --> 34:26.020
He always seemed like
such a nice man.

34:26.107 --> 34:28.849
Mm. He did, didn't he?

34:35.508 --> 34:37.423
Boat's heading over
to transport us back now.

34:37.510 --> 34:39.468
I'm gonna find someplace
to hold the prisoner.

34:39.555 --> 34:41.253
Good idea.
Tell Cho and Van Pelt.

34:41.340 --> 34:42.993
Okay.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.779
Well, we do thank you, ma'am.

34:45.866 --> 34:48.303
That was some nice work
you all did.

34:48.390 --> 34:50.436
Thank you, Mr. Stack.
Just doing our job.

34:50.523 --> 34:53.917
I did wonder about the man.
It was a feeling I had.

34:54.004 --> 34:55.702
I don't know
what it was exactly

34:55.789 --> 34:57.704
but, uh, normal people
don't feed crickets.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.053
Butterflies.

34:59.140 --> 35:01.534
Whatever. Bugs.

35:01.621 --> 35:04.537
The point is,
I got instincts about people.

35:04.624 --> 35:08.193
[Patrick laughing]
No, you don't.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.020
You were fooled,
just like everybody else.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.326
You callin' me a liar?

35:11.413 --> 35:13.372
No, it's only that
now you know him

35:13.459 --> 35:15.852
as Eddy Fish,
the violent sociopath.

35:15.939 --> 35:18.420
It's easy for you
to see him as a killer.

35:18.507 --> 35:21.162
But as the shy lepidopterist,
Gardiner?

35:21.249 --> 35:24.557
Impossible for anyone to imagine
him stabbing a man 14 times.

35:24.644 --> 35:27.908
- Eighteen times.
- Right. 18. 18 times.

35:27.995 --> 35:32.652
Unimaginable, and a number
that you can't forget

35:32.739 --> 35:34.044
once you've heard it.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.959
'Eighteen times.'

35:36.046 --> 35:37.961
Where did you hear it
exactly?

35:38.048 --> 35:41.835
What? Oh, uh, from you,
uh, earlier.

35:41.922 --> 35:45.012
No, not from me.
Where then?

35:45.099 --> 35:48.102
I-I don't...I don't know
what you're talking about.

35:48.189 --> 35:50.365
Gardiner killed
Talia's father.

35:50.452 --> 35:53.542
That's true, but, uh,
he didn't kill Talia.

35:53.629 --> 35:55.065
Well, he might have

35:55.153 --> 35:57.329
'if he'd known she was here
looking for him'

35:57.416 --> 35:58.852
'but he wouldn't have
raped her.'

35:58.939 --> 36:01.507
No, not his thing.

36:01.594 --> 36:03.248
You did it.

36:03.335 --> 36:06.076
'You met her on the ferryboat
coming back from the hospital.'

36:06.164 --> 36:07.948
[chuckling]
What? No.

36:08.035 --> 36:10.777
Wow. You say no,
but your eyes tell me yes.

36:10.864 --> 36:13.127
[Terence]
Talia asked for your help.

36:13.214 --> 36:15.477
She told you about
her father and Fish

36:15.564 --> 36:17.087
and the 18 stab wounds.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.612
That's how you got that
scratch on your face.

36:19.699 --> 36:22.049
You're strong enough to hold
a girl down single-handed

36:22.136 --> 36:23.659
but you couldn't protect
your face.

36:23.746 --> 36:25.618
Gardiner killed her.
We all saw.

36:25.705 --> 36:26.923
No.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.186
You're wrong.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.623
Doubtful.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.233
Proving it should
be easy, though

36:32.320 --> 36:34.714
since you gave us
your DNA to match.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.935
Cuff him, Lisbon.

36:41.503 --> 36:43.375
[motor rumbling]

36:45.159 --> 36:46.987
Does it make you
uncomfortable, Mr. Naylor

36:47.074 --> 36:48.423
being alone here with me?

36:48.510 --> 36:50.556
It should.

36:50.643 --> 36:53.298
I'd gladly hurt you for
what did to that poor girl

36:53.385 --> 36:54.734
hurt you badly.

36:54.821 --> 36:57.040
Whoa, agent.
Cool it down, okay?

36:57.127 --> 36:58.564
It's not his fault
what happened.

36:58.651 --> 37:00.479
Oh, please.
It's not his fault?

37:00.566 --> 37:01.784
No.

37:03.656 --> 37:05.135
You're a decent guy.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.920
I can tell.

37:07.007 --> 37:08.487
If you could have
controlled yourself

37:08.574 --> 37:10.315
you would have, right?

37:10.402 --> 37:12.534
You don't want to hurt anyone.

37:14.449 --> 37:15.972
- No.
- No.

37:16.059 --> 37:18.888
When you get those urges,
it's-it's like somebody else

37:18.975 --> 37:21.413
taking over your body, right?

37:21.500 --> 37:22.892
Somebody evil?

37:26.113 --> 37:27.462
Yeah.

37:27.549 --> 37:28.768
[scoffing]
Come on.

37:28.855 --> 37:30.378
No, really.

37:36.602 --> 37:38.821
[box scraping floor]

37:38.908 --> 37:40.649
Listen..

37:42.782 --> 37:45.654
...I understand that you were
trying to control yourself.

37:45.741 --> 37:48.178
That's why you went
to Stack's ranch on San Felix..

37:48.266 --> 37:50.964
...to take yourself away
somewhere safe

37:51.051 --> 37:53.053
somewhere away
from temptation, right?

37:54.533 --> 37:56.056
But then you hurt
your shoulder

37:56.143 --> 37:57.840
and a doctor needed
to set it

37:57.927 --> 38:00.321
and there's no doctor
on the island.

38:00.408 --> 38:03.237
I wanted to stay
on the ranch.

38:03.324 --> 38:05.544
I didn't..

38:05.631 --> 38:07.110
I didn't want to leave.

38:07.197 --> 38:09.765
And she was on the ferry
coming back, wasn't she?

38:09.852 --> 38:11.724
She asked about your arm.

38:12.986 --> 38:14.857
She came to me.

38:17.033 --> 38:19.732
She asked for my help

38:19.819 --> 38:21.255
wanted me to hide her.

38:21.342 --> 38:23.257
Yeah, so you took her
to the ranch.

38:23.344 --> 38:26.869
An outbuilding..

38:26.956 --> 38:28.480
...where nobody goes.

38:28.567 --> 38:31.396
Where no one would hear
when you raped and killed her.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.965
You can't judge me.

38:36.052 --> 38:38.272
You don't know
what it's like to be me.

38:38.359 --> 38:40.318
You think I want to be
like this?

38:40.405 --> 38:43.364
You have the gall to ask
for pity after what you've done?

38:43.451 --> 38:45.888
You'll get no pity

38:45.975 --> 38:47.803
not in this life
or the next.

38:55.681 --> 38:57.378
[sighing]

39:06.953 --> 39:09.651
Nice work back there.

39:09.738 --> 39:11.653
Thanks. You too.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.960
Yeah, we really had him
fooled, huh?

39:14.047 --> 39:16.005
He thought you were
a real hard case.

39:16.092 --> 39:17.920
[chuckling]
Yeah.

39:18.007 --> 39:19.966
Listen, about before
at the office with Sarah

39:20.053 --> 39:21.489
I just want to..

39:21.576 --> 39:23.752
Oh, yeah. Congratulations.
She seems nice.

39:23.839 --> 39:26.320
Yeah, I just don't want it
to be awkward between..

39:26.407 --> 39:27.626
[laughing]
With me?

39:27.713 --> 39:29.279
That's the least
of your problems.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.890
What does that mean?

39:30.977 --> 39:33.240
Well,
she's a public defender.

39:33.327 --> 39:36.025
I mean, good luck,
but be careful.

39:36.112 --> 39:38.767
[Lisbon]
'Hey. The boat's docking now.'

39:38.854 --> 39:41.117
Get the prisoners
and get 'em on board.

39:41.204 --> 39:43.424
- Yeah. Sure thing, boss.
- Have you seen Jane?

39:43.511 --> 39:45.121
- No.
- No.

39:45.208 --> 39:47.602
Better get here quick,
or he's gonna get left behind.

39:51.650 --> 39:53.216
[sighing]

40:46.835 --> 40:49.055
[theme music]
