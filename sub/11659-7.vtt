(applause)

00:52.133 --> 00:53.233
Finally...

00:53.300 --> 00:56.533
I'd like to thank
our hostesses tonight,

00:56.600 --> 01:00.367
Dorothy, Rose and Blanche.

01:00.433 --> 01:02.467
With supporters like them,

01:02.533 --> 01:05.567
I'm proud just to be running
for city councilman.

01:07.166 --> 01:12.633
So, good night, and remember my slogan,
"Gil Kessler for city councilman."

01:13.934 --> 01:15.767
You call that a slogan?

01:15.834 --> 01:17.033
Excuse us.

01:17.533 --> 01:20.100
You break the arm, you pay for it.

01:23.467 --> 01:26.834
You promised you'd stay in your room
during the meeting.

01:26.900 --> 01:28.033
Who am I, Alf?

01:29.734 --> 01:32.133
-I was hungry.
-You were spying.

01:32.200 --> 01:33.633
So what? He's a wimp, Dorothy.

01:35.066 --> 01:40.900
Gil Kessler is a very bright man,
an honest and devoted civic leader...

01:41.600 --> 01:44.200
and probably the biggest
wimp I've ever known.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.700
There's something else
I don't like about him.

01:47.767 --> 01:51.100
-What?
-I can't put my finger on it,

01:51.166 --> 01:53.233
but if I could, I'd have to wash it.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.400
Ma, do me one favor.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.900
Stay here until we're finished.

02:00.433 --> 02:03.367
I can't believe you think
your own mother would embarrass you.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.233
It's not that, ma.

02:06.934 --> 02:08.400
It's that, ma.

02:16.800 --> 02:20.066
Well, I better skedaddle.
You know, my wife is out of town.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.600
I'm gonna be up half the night

02:21.667 --> 02:24.834
trying to pick out a tie,
sock, hankie combo.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.834
This is just the kind
of behind the scenes excitement

02:27.900 --> 02:29.734
I was hoping to be part of.

02:30.433 --> 02:32.900
-Goodnight.
-(all) goodnight.

02:33.367 --> 02:36.700
Well, I think we ought to be proud.
We threw one heck of a party.

02:37.033 --> 02:40.233
Don't you guys just love
being involved in politics?

02:40.300 --> 02:43.834
Oh, I haven't had this much fun
since I worked on the Dewey campaign.

02:45.233 --> 02:49.333
-Rose, you worked for Thomas Dewey?
-No, Mervil Dewey.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.200
The founder of the
Dewey decimal system.

02:54.333 --> 02:58.200
Your Gil Kessler doesn't stand a
chance of winning.

02:58.266 --> 02:59.300
Who says?

02:59.367 --> 03:02.233
The <i>Miami Post, </i>the <i>Miami Journal,</i>

03:02.300 --> 03:05.633
the <i>Miami Tribune,</i>
and Miami's own Sophia Petrillo.

03:06.166 --> 03:10.233
He's behind in the polls,
but the election's two days away.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.433
A lot can happen in two days.

03:13.133 --> 03:16.600
I'll do everything in my power
to get Gil elected.

03:16.667 --> 03:20.200
You can take this folder
he left over to his house.

03:20.266 --> 03:23.533
On the other hand,
why deprive Rose of a chance to help?

03:24.233 --> 03:28.166
-Ok. But you'll have to wash these.
-Honey, those dishes are dirty.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.900
Ok. I'll deliver the folder.

03:33.166 --> 03:36.900
There's no sacrifice too great
for a cause you believe in.

03:37.400 --> 03:41.066
I hope that stupid jerk
reimburses me for gas and mileage.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.166
There goes a great American.

03:49.633 --> 03:56.467
(hammering)

03:57.500 --> 03:59.166
I woke you up, didn't I?

04:01.333 --> 04:03.767
And I better have a good reason.
Well, I do.

04:03.834 --> 04:06.100
I got a great idea for Gil's campaign.

04:06.166 --> 04:09.467
I'm making bird feeders
with his name on them to send around.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.767
You think that's a dumb idea.

04:15.667 --> 04:19.533
And you feel like taking this bird feeder
and smashing it with this hammer.

04:20.567 --> 04:21.567
Like this...

04:27.100 --> 04:28.767
Holy smoke.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.600
Holy Toledo.

04:30.900 --> 04:33.200
-Holy mackerel.
-What, ma?

04:33.266 --> 04:34.500
Nothing.

04:36.934 --> 04:38.400
What is it, Sophia?

04:40.233 --> 04:42.600
-Oh!
-What, Rose?

04:42.667 --> 04:45.333
They caught Gil Kessler having an affair.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.066
You're kidding. With whom?

04:48.133 --> 04:49.600
They don't know her name,

04:49.667 --> 04:52.266
but they hid in the bushes
and took this picture

04:52.333 --> 04:55.066
of her going into his house.

04:56.734 --> 04:58.100
I don't believe it.

04:58.900 --> 05:02.000
Wait a minute.
That looks like Blanche's red dress.

05:04.066 --> 05:05.934
And those look like Blanche's red shoes.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.133
And aren't they her diamond earrings
and gold bracelet?

05:09.834 --> 05:12.767
That little floozy stole
Blanche's clothes!

05:19.367 --> 05:22.367
It's like having Agatha Christie
right here in our kitchen.

05:23.867 --> 05:26.300
Rose, Blanche is that little floozy.

05:27.300 --> 05:30.333
-You... you mean he...
-She's at the 50...

05:30.400 --> 05:34.967
-the 40, the 30.
-Oh... oh!

05:36.567 --> 05:38.066
Blanche, it's you.

05:38.533 --> 05:41.734
You're getting so good at that.
Who's that over there?

05:44.533 --> 05:48.633
-No, I mean right here.
-Oh, my God!

05:49.033 --> 05:53.100
My backside is spread all across the front
page. How could they do that?

05:53.834 --> 05:55.800
They probably used a wide-angle lens.

06:01.233 --> 06:04.867
If I'd known,
I would have turned around and smiled.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.567
Ruining a man's career
for a one-night stand

06:09.633 --> 06:13.066
-is hardly something to make light of.
-Now, wait...

06:13.133 --> 06:14.567
you girls don't believe this?

06:15.734 --> 06:20.467
Well, I'm not denying the photo,
but I deny anything happened.

06:20.734 --> 06:25.266
-I just dropped off his folder.
-Then why were you in his house

06:25.333 --> 06:27.934
-for two hours?
-We were just talking.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.367
Why does it say the
explosion was so great

06:30.433 --> 06:32.900
it shattered windows next door?

06:35.233 --> 06:38.433
Rose, that's an article
about an earthquake in Guatemala.

06:43.967 --> 06:47.734
I dropped off the folder,
talked for two hours,

06:47.800 --> 06:51.700
helped him pick out his tie, sock,
hankie combo, and came home.

06:51.767 --> 06:53.233
Nothing else happened.

06:53.934 --> 06:55.133
I swear.

06:56.100 --> 06:57.500
Okay?

06:59.500 --> 07:01.000
Okay.

07:01.066 --> 07:05.000
How do we help him out of this mess?
Maybe I should call the newspapers.

07:05.066 --> 07:08.400
Let Gil handle it himself.

07:08.734 --> 07:11.533
He's having a press
conference this afternoon.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.934
I don't think you should
do anything until then.

07:14.033 --> 07:15.433
Ok. Fine. I'll wait.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.600
Look at this picture of Kessler.

07:17.867 --> 07:21.500
There's a secret behind those eyes.
Trust my hunch. I'm never wrong.

07:21.567 --> 07:25.700
Remember your hunch
about your nephew Angelo?

07:25.767 --> 07:29.300
-You said one day he'd be Pope.
-You've got to pay attention.

07:29.367 --> 07:31.333
I said one day he'd sell dope.

07:34.834 --> 07:37.867
What do you think he went to Attica for,
the volleyball program?

07:49.867 --> 07:51.066
Bruno Bonafiglio.

07:51.934 --> 07:53.467
Ma, I was asleep.

07:53.533 --> 07:57.867
So was I, that's when it came to me.
Picture this, Sicily, 1922.

07:58.166 --> 08:00.800
The village is in a terrible wine crisis.

08:01.266 --> 08:03.033
It's the peak of the wine season.

08:03.100 --> 08:08.400
And all our great stompers are ravaged
by an outbreak of athlete's foot.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.500
Soon the Chianti has a green hue
and tastes like Deconex.

08:19.166 --> 08:23.700
They call in Sicily's foremost
pediatrist, Bruno Bonafiglio.

08:23.767 --> 08:26.734
He's the one who proscribed
arch support for Mussolini.

08:28.033 --> 08:31.300
Must have really helped his lower back
when they hung him by his heels.

08:33.333 --> 08:36.100
Forget him, I'm talking
about Bruno Bonafiglio.

08:36.567 --> 08:40.367
I take one look at him
and I have a hunch he's trouble...

08:40.834 --> 08:43.367
but nobody believes me.
So what happens?

08:43.633 --> 08:46.700
He cures everybody
and wine sales skyrocket.

08:47.166 --> 08:49.100
Wait... wait a minute. Ma.

08:49.166 --> 08:52.633
Unless I'm missing something,
your hunch was wrong.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.533
My hunches are never wrong.

08:55.066 --> 08:59.066
Now, everyone is living high on the hog
and eating rich foods.

08:59.367 --> 09:01.767
The next thing you know
there's a gout epidemic.

09:02.266 --> 09:04.100
Nobody can stomp grapes

09:04.166 --> 09:07.367
and Bruno makes a killing
selling orthopedic sandals.

09:09.333 --> 09:13.600
Don't tell me, he went to America
and changed his name to Dr. Scholl.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.900
No, actually he developed a foot fetish

09:17.967 --> 09:20.900
and suffocated when he shoved his head
in a ladies rubber boot.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.166
Ma, don't ever wake me up again.

09:32.600 --> 09:36.600
Dorothy, quick, turn on the television.
Gil's press conference is starting.

09:37.166 --> 09:39.500
I hope they're not too hard on him.

09:39.567 --> 09:42.166
I wouldn't be too sure.
Look at all those reporters.

09:42.734 --> 09:44.667
Yeah. There's Charlie Thompson

09:44.734 --> 09:47.200
and Fred Leone, and Mike Devlin...

09:51.066 --> 09:53.133
I had lunch at the press club once.

09:54.133 --> 09:55.300
Only once?

09:55.367 --> 09:59.467
It took me two years to learn everybody's
name on <i>Eight Is Enough.</i>

10:00.800 --> 10:02.100
Hush! He's starting.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.734
<i>We'll find out.</i>

10:04.800 --> 10:07.600
<i>Here come the candidate</i>
<i>and his campaign manager.</i>

10:08.266 --> 10:09.400
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

10:10.400 --> 10:13.667
<i>I'm here to respond</i>
<i>to the media's speculation...</i>

10:14.633 --> 10:17.533
<i>that I'm having an affair</i>
<i>with an unidentified woman.</i>

10:19.333 --> 10:22.900
<i>I have been the subject</i>
<i>of many scurrilous...</i>

10:22.967 --> 10:26.500
<i>slanderous, and downright malicious rumors</i>
<i>in my political career...</i>

10:27.133 --> 10:30.533
<i>but this rumor is the worst kind of rumor.</i>

10:31.033 --> 10:32.033
<i>This is...</i>

10:32.700 --> 10:33.700
<i>a true rumor.</i>

10:35.100 --> 10:37.100
<i>It happened like you said.</i>

10:37.633 --> 10:39.633
Not with me it didn't.

10:39.700 --> 10:41.934
<i>Mr. Kessler, who was the woman?</i>

10:42.400 --> 10:45.433
<i>I can't reveal her identity</i>
<i>under any circumstances.</i>

10:45.500 --> 10:50.000
<i>Independent sources have already</i>
<i>identified her as Blanche Devereaux.</i>

10:50.066 --> 10:52.533
<i>Oh, please. What sources?</i>

10:58.867 --> 11:00.367
<i>Sorry, Blanche.</i>

11:01.000 --> 11:02.333
I don't believe this.

11:02.734 --> 11:04.333
-He just lied.
-(turns off)

11:04.700 --> 11:05.700
Dorothy.

11:06.300 --> 11:09.233
Rose. Don't you girls believe me?

11:11.266 --> 11:12.266
Sophia?

11:12.700 --> 11:14.700
I believe you, Blanche. Absolutely.

11:15.367 --> 11:16.367
Hello?

11:16.633 --> 11:18.333
I need a number for <i>People</i> magazine.

11:22.233 --> 11:23.867
The department that buys stories

11:23.934 --> 11:26.567
about politicians who sleep
with sleazy broads.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.633
Don't worry. It's not about you.

11:45.700 --> 11:49.100
Dorothy... Rose... talk to me.

11:50.166 --> 11:51.934
You've got to believe me.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.066
We believed you once.
We're not falling for it again.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.500
Falling for what?
I told you the truth.

11:58.567 --> 12:03.033
Come off it.
You expect us to believe Gil was lying

12:03.100 --> 12:07.533
-in front of a million people?
-People lie on television.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.667
They lie on <i>60 minutes.</i>

12:10.800 --> 12:13.467
He's a married man running for election.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.066
Why would he admit having
an affair if he hadn't?

12:16.133 --> 12:17.467
I don't know.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.533
I also don't know
why you assume I'm guilty.

12:21.533 --> 12:24.133
Give me one good reason why I'd lie.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.133
You're embarrassed
because you seduced him.

12:26.200 --> 12:29.266
You're scared and guilty
because you've ruined his campaign.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.800
Three good reasons.

12:32.533 --> 12:34.266
-Oh, shut up, Rose.
-Oh, shut up, Rose.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.367
(telephone rings)

12:40.033 --> 12:41.033
Hello.

12:41.567 --> 12:43.266
Yes, this is Blanche Devereaux.

12:44.767 --> 12:49.667
Yes, that Blanche Devereaux,
and no, I did not! Absolutely not!

12:49.734 --> 12:53.000
I will tell it to a judge. I will yell it
from the highest mountaintops.

12:53.066 --> 12:54.900
I will swear on a stack of bibles!

12:57.266 --> 12:58.900
Did that sound like a liar?

12:58.967 --> 13:02.433
No. It sounded like Jim and Tammy Faye
on <i>Nightline.</i>

13:07.834 --> 13:10.033
(telephone rings)

13:11.166 --> 13:15.533
Hello. Yes, this is Blanche.
How did you get this number?

13:15.600 --> 13:17.500
And better yet,
why am I even talking to you?

13:17.567 --> 13:20.433
I don't like you. I hate you.

13:20.767 --> 13:24.400
Just tear up my number,
then climb back under your slimy rock

13:24.467 --> 13:28.266
with your other slimy friends.
Don't ever call here again!

13:30.967 --> 13:32.300
Dorothy, call Stan.

13:39.133 --> 13:42.400
Admit it. You made a mistake.

13:42.667 --> 13:45.734
You live your life a certain way,
now you're paying.

13:45.800 --> 13:50.667
You are assuming I'm guilty
because of my past. That is not fair.

13:51.633 --> 13:54.133
I'm in trouble here.
This isn't funny anymore.

13:54.200 --> 13:57.567
You're right.
This is not funny, it's sad.

13:58.100 --> 14:02.667
You couldn't tell us the truth,
and you still can't.

14:02.734 --> 14:04.400
Don't do this to me.

14:05.433 --> 14:07.033
You're my two best friends.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.467
How do we know you're
telling the truth about that?

14:11.166 --> 14:12.400
Well, I guess you don't.

14:17.100 --> 14:18.200
(door slams)

14:28.133 --> 14:31.133
-Excuse me, miss. You can't go in there.
-The hell I can't.

14:34.233 --> 14:36.800
I ought to kick
your butt from here to Tallahassee.

14:36.867 --> 14:38.867
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

14:38.934 --> 14:40.734
Are reporters badgering you?

14:40.800 --> 14:44.266
Do you have roommates calling you a liar?
You're the damn liar!

14:44.333 --> 14:47.500
I wouldn't sleep with you
if you were the last man in creation.

14:47.767 --> 14:49.700
-Why did you lie?
-The reason--

14:49.767 --> 14:53.734
-why? Why?
-Nobody listens to me.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.567
Quit whining, you wimp. Tell me.

14:56.633 --> 15:00.300
That is the reason. Nobody ever listens
to me. They never have.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.900
I'm a wimp, just like you said.

15:03.867 --> 15:05.500
Until today.

15:05.767 --> 15:08.700
Blanche, when the newspaper said
I had an affair,

15:08.767 --> 15:13.500
people stopped thinking I was a wimp.
I couldn't tell them it was a mistake.

15:13.567 --> 15:14.834
Are you trying to tell me

15:14.900 --> 15:18.066
people like you better
because they think you went to bed

15:18.133 --> 15:20.300
with a gorgeous, intelligent woman?

15:21.867 --> 15:24.066
Here, see for yourself.
This is today's poll.

15:25.400 --> 15:29.333
I never expected they'd discover
it was you in that picture.

15:29.867 --> 15:33.266
-I felt terrible.
-How do you think I feel?

15:33.333 --> 15:35.200
People think I slept with you.

15:38.333 --> 15:42.066
Blanche... all my life...

15:42.433 --> 15:44.367
people have looked right past me.

15:45.033 --> 15:46.433
When I was growing up...

15:47.066 --> 15:51.567
the first day back at school every year,
half the kids thought I was new in town.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.500
I'd bring in a yearbook
to prove them wrong.

15:55.533 --> 16:00.633
I felt, deep inside, was a great man
trying to get out.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.266
So I went into politics...

16:02.333 --> 16:05.233
and people kept looking
past that great man.

16:05.900 --> 16:07.066
Until today.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.567
As crazy as it sounds,

16:09.633 --> 16:12.300
I've got a real chance
to win that election.

16:12.367 --> 16:15.166
-Because you lied.
-Is that price too high to pay?

16:15.233 --> 16:19.767
I don't know much about politics,
but I know men.

16:19.834 --> 16:21.533
I know your kind.

16:22.066 --> 16:24.100
You're an honest man.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.400
That's why we all believed in you.

16:26.834 --> 16:30.834
But now you're lying, and you're just like
so many other politicians.

16:30.900 --> 16:32.433
Dishonest.

16:32.500 --> 16:35.500
If you win, it won't mean a hill of beans.

16:35.567 --> 16:37.600
It won't be you winning.

16:39.033 --> 16:43.600
You'll never be a great man, Gil,
without being an honest man.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.266
You think about that.

17:05.500 --> 17:06.967
This is exciting.

17:07.033 --> 17:11.066
In less than 24 hours,
Gil could be city councilman.

17:11.600 --> 17:14.767
I'd love to get excited,
but no matter what happens...

17:15.166 --> 17:19.066
I'm going to get stuck cleaning out
that peeing angel punch bowl.

17:24.266 --> 17:26.834
Dorothy, I've been chatting
with your boy Kessler.

17:26.900 --> 17:31.033
Give me another hour,
I'll figure out his secret.

17:31.100 --> 17:34.433
-What secret?
-I said give me another hour.

17:37.166 --> 17:40.300
Get away from me.
I have nothing to say to you...

17:40.867 --> 17:42.467
except this...

17:42.533 --> 17:48.667
when my name appears in print,
it better read, "Blanche Devereaux, 39."

17:52.033 --> 17:57.567
-She has nerve showing up here tonight.
-Let's try to be polite, Rose.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.633
Okay.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.900
Hi, Blanche.

18:03.967 --> 18:05.600
Blanche, I said hello.

18:06.233 --> 18:08.734
I don't speak to people
who call me a liar.

18:09.300 --> 18:13.667
We're in public.
There's no reason to be hostile.

18:13.934 --> 18:15.567
Oh, yes, there is. I don't like you.

18:15.633 --> 18:19.033
And horizontal stripes
make you look like Roger Ebert.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.934
Do you really want to start name-calling?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.200
-Yes.
-So do I.

18:26.266 --> 18:28.867
-Traitor. Backstabber.
-Tramp. Home wrecker.

18:28.934 --> 18:30.600
Indian giver!

18:32.900 --> 18:35.300
I'm sorry.
I just got caught up in the moment.

18:38.800 --> 18:42.400
Ladies and gentlemen...
if I could have your attention...

18:42.767 --> 18:44.700
I'd like to say a few words.

18:45.300 --> 18:51.033
First off, I want to thank all of you.
This has been a great campaign.

18:51.333 --> 18:54.533
Tomorrow, I could be your city councilman.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.533
(applause)

18:56.600 --> 19:01.100
I don't want to be councilman,
unless I win honestly.

19:01.166 --> 19:03.867
There's something
I haven't been honest about.

19:05.700 --> 19:08.600
Blanche Devereaux and I
never had an affair.

19:10.467 --> 19:13.266
I only said that to improve my image.

19:13.967 --> 19:15.767
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.700
Blanche is too good a person
to be used that way.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.934
She made me realize
how important honesty is.

19:23.667 --> 19:27.033
That's why I'm going
to be honest with you.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.400
I'm not who you think I am.

19:31.367 --> 19:35.767
In 1968, I had an operation.

19:36.266 --> 19:38.533
Until that time, I lived life

19:38.600 --> 19:43.033
as part-time stenographer
and mild-mannered housewife,

19:43.100 --> 19:45.233
Anna Maria Bonaducci.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.600
What?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.834
I can't believe it.

19:54.467 --> 19:56.600
What do you say
about my hunches now?

19:56.667 --> 19:58.400
Five more minutes, I would've had it.

19:59.300 --> 20:03.533
Ma, how could you know?
No one knew.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.633
Please, look at his nose.
Of course he's Italian.

20:19.333 --> 20:23.600
I'm still confused about the operation
Gil Kessler had.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.333
Is the man asleep during it?

20:28.767 --> 20:30.533
I think so, Rose.

20:35.834 --> 20:39.633
And what about the parts they put on,
do they test them first?

20:44.166 --> 20:46.900
Of course, Rose.
You know, like windshield wipers.

20:49.266 --> 20:50.500
So they work.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.200
-I assume so, yes.
-Oh.

21:02.233 --> 21:03.633
What are they made of?

21:08.667 --> 21:10.467
Silly putty, Rose.

21:14.667 --> 21:18.200
I don't know.
I want to forget the whole incident.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.734
It's been a terrible night.

21:20.800 --> 21:24.133
Because Gil dropped out of the election,
and Blanche hates us.

21:24.200 --> 21:29.200
No, I'm upset because they haven't rerun
<i>Facts of Life goes to Australia.</i>

21:32.100 --> 21:35.100
I wouldn't be surprised
if Blanche never speaks to us again.

21:35.166 --> 21:37.900
She'd certainly have every reason not to.

21:38.500 --> 21:41.633
We did a terrible thing not believing her.

21:42.900 --> 21:47.700
We might as well get used to the fact
she'll be mad for a long time.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.767
Hi, girls. How y'all doing?

21:52.834 --> 21:54.867
Blanche, aren't you mad?

21:55.433 --> 21:58.533
-Not anymore.
-We did a terrible thing.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.834
You should stay mad for a long time.

22:03.400 --> 22:07.734
You should make us
grovel, eat dirt, beg for forgiveness,

22:07.800 --> 22:11.133
-give us the silent treatment.
-If you give us the silent treatment,

22:11.200 --> 22:12.367
I will eat dirt.

22:18.367 --> 22:20.767
I couldn't stay mad at you girls.

22:20.834 --> 22:25.667
I did some thinking and realized I was as
much to blame as you.

22:26.767 --> 22:29.367
-How?
-By talking so much.

22:29.734 --> 22:32.900
I've always talked a lot about my men.

22:32.967 --> 22:37.000
And... well, sometimes
I've stretched the truth just a little.

22:37.066 --> 22:39.934
It's an old southern tradition,
storytelling.

22:40.433 --> 22:42.066
Just because you
didn't have a good time,

22:42.133 --> 22:44.734
is no reason to bore your friends
with a dull story.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.400
So you embellish it.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.900
Add a little shading, a little hot tub.

22:53.633 --> 22:55.567
I guess it finally caught up with me.

22:56.867 --> 22:59.600
But I do think I've learned my lesson.

23:01.367 --> 23:06.133
-Can we have a hug and forget this?
-You bet we can!

23:06.200 --> 23:07.734
Come here, you two.

23:11.967 --> 23:15.800
-Oh, I'm glad we're friends again.
-Me too!

23:16.734 --> 23:21.000
Listen, Blanche,
now that we have you telling the truth...

23:23.233 --> 23:25.400
would you tell us the truth about...

23:26.400 --> 23:27.967
Bob Fredericks?

23:30.967 --> 23:33.233
True. Absolutely true.

23:34.266 --> 23:35.867
How about Howard Asher?

23:37.300 --> 23:39.900
-True.
-(laughing)

23:42.133 --> 23:43.266
Eric Murdock?

23:45.000 --> 23:46.400
True. True.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.500
-He had a twin brother.
-(laughing)

23:50.166 --> 23:52.667
Hey! Would I lie to my two
best friends?

24:04.066 --> 24:09.867
(theme music playing)
