01:10.612 --> 01:11.613
Hye-su,

01:12.238 --> 01:13.281
I'm sorry,

01:13.740 --> 01:15.408
but let's forget the surgery.

01:15.992 --> 01:17.410
I'll contact you later,

01:17.702 --> 01:19.329
so please go home for now.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.842
Did something happen to her?

01:35.053 --> 01:37.806
Mr. Han came by two days ago.

01:38.264 --> 01:41.351
She didn't look well ever since.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.103
Okay. I'll look for her.

01:45.438 --> 01:48.900
Of the main customers that visit
family restaurants in today's society,

01:49.359 --> 01:52.737
about 45 percent are in their 30s,
62 percent are office workers,

01:52.821 --> 01:56.616
and 65 percent are couples going on dates.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.993
Of the customers that visit
family restaurants,

01:59.077 --> 02:01.996
about 45 percent visit over
15 times a month.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.499
Eating out

02:05.416 --> 02:07.127
is no longer just about eating a meal.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.295
It is a culture.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.684
The person you are trying to reach...

02:31.734 --> 02:33.361
MS. OH

02:35.321 --> 02:38.032
The person you are trying
to reach cannot answer the phone.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.492
Please leave a message...

02:45.999 --> 02:47.959
-Good work.
-Thanks.

02:53.506 --> 02:54.966
Don't you have anything to say to me?

02:56.301 --> 02:58.761
Let's talk about our problems later.

03:00.179 --> 03:01.180
Let's go.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.017
Are you running away again?

03:06.352 --> 03:07.937
I know you're ashamed,

03:08.688 --> 03:11.024
but shouldn't you at least apologize?

03:11.649 --> 03:13.276
I may be generous,

03:13.526 --> 03:16.571
but this is a matter of ethics and
morality. I can't just let this one go.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.114
Tell me.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.449
What do you think?

03:19.866 --> 03:22.368
Do you think that
what's happening between us

03:22.952 --> 03:24.120
is normal?

03:25.830 --> 03:27.916
Move. Don't pick a fight with me.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.334
A fight?

03:29.834 --> 03:30.877
Pick a fight?

03:31.544 --> 03:33.087
You call this picking a fight, you punk?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.381
What do you think you're doing?

03:52.607 --> 03:53.524
Excuse me.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.366
What happened?

04:01.699 --> 04:03.117
Shouldn't you be in surgery right now?

04:05.245 --> 04:09.290
I'm not going through with the surgery.

04:09.749 --> 04:10.750
What?

04:11.167 --> 04:12.961
Listen to me carefully, Ji-hun.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.839
I've decided to live my own life.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.009
However many days I have left,

04:20.802 --> 04:23.054
I'll accept things as they are.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.599
I know you tried really hard.

04:26.933 --> 04:27.976
I'm sorry.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.604
Where are you?

04:34.148 --> 04:36.818
I'm not on my way to die, so don't worry.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.279
I want to go somewhere
where the air is good,

04:39.862 --> 04:42.782
think positive things, eat good food,

04:43.616 --> 04:45.451
live in peace,

04:46.452 --> 04:47.745
and then leave peacefully.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.291
I'm going to let my life run its course.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.751
I'll live as long as the heavens allow

04:54.502 --> 04:56.004
and leave when my time comes.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.883
I'll call you when I leave.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.929
Forget everything and devote yourself

05:06.055 --> 05:07.515
to your life now.

05:08.474 --> 05:09.475
Are you kidding me?

05:09.600 --> 05:10.977
Why aren't you getting the surgery?

05:11.269 --> 05:12.854
Don't you know what I did for that?

05:14.647 --> 05:15.732
Take care.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.484
Thanks for everything.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.487
Hello?

05:21.779 --> 05:22.780
Hello?

05:44.927 --> 05:45.803
Gosh.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.562
EXPRESS FERRY

05:58.691 --> 06:00.651
Do you realize what you've done?

06:01.360 --> 06:03.362
If I were you,
I would've given up and died long ago.

06:04.113 --> 06:06.365
How could you be a leech all your life?

06:06.991 --> 06:08.618
Do you want to live that badly,

06:09.660 --> 06:11.913
even if it means sacrificing
someone else's life?

06:13.372 --> 06:15.041
You latched onto me when you were young,

06:15.124 --> 06:16.751
and then onto your son
now that you're old.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.669
Aren't you ashamed?

06:42.985 --> 06:44.070
MR. HAN

06:44.153 --> 06:45.530
The surgery has been canceled.

06:53.287 --> 06:56.415
MR. HAN

07:17.770 --> 07:19.105
I have to make a call. I'll be back.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.259
Do you know what my wish is?

09:12.718 --> 09:16.138
I want to take a family portrait
like other families.

09:17.723 --> 09:18.724
I want one with my son,

09:19.392 --> 09:21.310
daughter-in-law, and grandchild.

09:22.144 --> 09:25.648
I want to take a proper family picture.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.903
I've been nothing
but a shadow all my life.

09:31.946 --> 09:35.700
I don't want to disappear silently
like a shadow.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.256
I'm here, Dad.

09:50.923 --> 09:51.924
Hi.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.178
The board of directors has been
complimenting you a lot.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.306
You'll be promoted early next month.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.642
Get ready to be an executive director.

10:02.226 --> 10:03.603
You've been doing well.

10:03.936 --> 10:04.979
Good job.

10:06.522 --> 10:09.775
You should start thinking big.

10:13.154 --> 10:16.157
I heard your mom disappeared
without getting her surgery.

10:17.533 --> 10:18.367
Dad,

10:18.701 --> 10:19.910
did you go and see Mom?

10:20.494 --> 10:22.455
Are you implying that it's my fault
she disappeared?

10:24.165 --> 10:25.750
She is so exasperating.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.918
She should've left sooner
if she was going to leave.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.963
She runs away now
after making you get married?

10:31.505 --> 10:33.174
She's a troublemaker to the end.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.094
That girl must be jumping for joy.

10:37.511 --> 10:39.764
Since the surgery isn't happening,
divorce her right away.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.183
When do you want to meet the attorney?

10:43.392 --> 10:45.645
-Dad.
-What now?

10:46.020 --> 10:47.313
Just give up.

10:47.688 --> 10:50.483
She wants to die, so let her die.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.319
Let me go and see her

10:53.986 --> 10:55.363
just one last time.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.823
I'd at least like to say goodbye.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.367
Say goodbye?

10:59.784 --> 11:00.660
Yes.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.203
Just give me two days.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.371
What about the divorce?

11:06.916 --> 11:08.459
I'll do it when I get back.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.800
Close your eyes and go to sleep.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.220
That lady causes so much trouble.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.557
How could she disappear
on the day of the surgery?

11:27.436 --> 11:29.480
The person you are trying
to reach cannot answer the phone.

11:29.563 --> 11:30.815
And why didn't that man show up

11:31.649 --> 11:34.026
when his mom
was supposed to be getting surgery?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.320
Gosh. I don't understand him.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.239
I'm sure he had his reasons.

11:38.864 --> 11:39.990
Surely it wasn't on purpose.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.208
Hey.

11:50.793 --> 11:51.794
Does he still

11:52.044 --> 11:54.588
make your heart flutter?

11:57.091 --> 11:59.009
I'm calling because I'm worried,
that's all.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.178
He has a girlfriend.

12:01.470 --> 12:04.056
-Don't be silly.
-Why is this silly?

12:04.598 --> 12:07.643
And why does a married man
have a girlfriend?

12:07.768 --> 12:09.019
Is your husband cheating on you?

12:10.062 --> 12:12.106
-Oh, my--
-Sorry.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.483
Go back to sleep.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.769
Did you meet your mom?

12:50.853 --> 12:52.146
-Is it Mr. Han?
-Yes.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.149
Oh, my gosh.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.471
Is your mom going through a hard time?

13:28.390 --> 13:30.643
Where is she? Is she back in the hospital?

13:36.857 --> 13:38.150
Thank goodness.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.778
I was so worried

13:41.529 --> 13:44.281
that she'd have bad thoughts
like last time.

13:52.831 --> 13:53.832
Hye-su.

13:56.126 --> 13:57.628
Can you do something for me

13:58.796 --> 14:00.172
one last time?

14:01.298 --> 14:02.299
What is it?

14:04.802 --> 14:06.095
I'm going to go and see my mom.

14:07.304 --> 14:08.973
Can you come with me?

14:12.184 --> 14:13.185
Come with me,

14:13.936 --> 14:15.104
and bring Eun-seong, too.

14:16.605 --> 14:17.982
Eun-seong, too?

14:30.244 --> 14:32.580
It's been a while, Mom.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.754
It's been a while,

14:41.171 --> 14:42.298
Dad.

14:45.092 --> 14:48.345
How have you been?

14:50.598 --> 14:51.724
Look who it is.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.937
I heard that someone who looks like you
was in town,

14:57.479 --> 14:58.898
and I couldn't believe it.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.150
Why did you come here?

15:01.650 --> 15:05.529
How dare you show your face here?

15:07.239 --> 15:09.283
How have you been, my dear brother?

15:09.450 --> 15:10.993
I'm not your brother.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.037
I don't have a sister like you.

15:13.787 --> 15:14.788
Leave.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.124
These are my parents' graves.

15:17.791 --> 15:20.753
Who are you to act all sad
in front of my parents' graves?

15:21.253 --> 15:23.172
I'll leave after greeting them.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.007
Forget the greetings.

15:26.675 --> 15:27.676
Just get lost.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.553
Can't I even greet them?

15:30.262 --> 15:31.805
I know I'm a sinner,

15:32.056 --> 15:34.099
but I should still be able
to greet my parents.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.976
I'm glad you're aware of it.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.645
A sinner?

15:38.354 --> 15:40.481
At least you know what you are.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.608
You didn't even come for their funerals.

15:42.858 --> 15:45.277
Why are you trying to act
like their daughter now?

15:46.278 --> 15:47.905
I know what you're thinking.

15:48.530 --> 15:51.075
You came to ask me to donate my liver,
didn't you?

15:51.450 --> 15:53.953
You sent your son but he failed,

15:54.036 --> 15:56.288
so you came yourself this time, right?

15:56.956 --> 15:59.875
Do you feel desperate

16:00.000 --> 16:01.627
now that your death is near?

16:03.379 --> 16:05.714
It's not like that. Don't worry.

16:06.548 --> 16:07.841
Don't lie to me.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.470
You can act sad all you want,

16:11.637 --> 16:12.846
but it won't work.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.515
Dream on.

16:14.890 --> 16:15.891
Leave.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.644
-I said, leave!
-Get off me!

16:20.479 --> 16:21.897
I'm going to die here.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.526
I'm going to die next to our parents.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.528
Don't come any closer.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.238
If you do,

16:29.530 --> 16:32.241
I'll die right here!

16:32.324 --> 16:33.450
Don't come any closer.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.452
Don't come any closer.

16:44.753 --> 16:47.339
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to announce the following.

16:47.631 --> 16:50.134
Gosh, look over there, Mom.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.637
There are so many mountains
on top of the ocean.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.974
Eun-seong, those aren't mountains.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.100
They're islands.

16:58.308 --> 16:59.601
I see.

17:00.310 --> 17:01.395
Islands.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.023
How could you not have taken her once
to see the ocean?

17:04.565 --> 17:05.941
She doesn't even know what islands are.

17:06.650 --> 17:07.651
I know, right?

17:09.153 --> 17:10.154
Why didn't I?

17:10.279 --> 17:11.780
-But Mom.
-Yes?

17:11.905 --> 17:13.699
Where are we going?

17:13.991 --> 17:14.825
Well,

17:15.492 --> 17:16.952
we're going

17:17.619 --> 17:19.163
to meet his mom.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.373
His mom?

17:22.708 --> 17:24.460
Yes. His mom.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.003
Grandma.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.547
Grandma is very sick.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.133
Let's go and make her happy.

17:31.508 --> 17:34.636
If we make her happy,
will she get better and not be sick?

17:34.762 --> 17:38.015
Of course. If we make her happy,
she'll be completely better.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.850
Let's make her better and say,

17:40.142 --> 17:41.727
"Come on.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.229
Come with us, Grandma."

17:44.313 --> 17:45.314
And bring her back with us.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.398
Okay.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.952
EXPRESS FERRY

18:00.788 --> 18:02.331
Get off me!

18:02.414 --> 18:03.624
The boat is here.

18:03.707 --> 18:04.708
Get on it and leave.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.668
Let go of me. I won't go.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.504
-Let go.
-Come on.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.339
-Uncle.
-Get on the boat.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.342
Look who's here.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.344
I'm glad you're here.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.013
Take your mom and go back.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.432
Why did you come here?

18:20.516 --> 18:22.184
And why did you bring them?

18:23.352 --> 18:24.686
I don't know what's going on,

18:24.770 --> 18:27.147
but take your mom and leave.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.650
-Hey!
-Uncle.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.404
Why, that...

18:38.158 --> 18:39.159
Let me introduce you.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.121
They are my wife and daughter.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.665
-Hello.
-Hello.

18:50.629 --> 18:51.630
Daughter?

18:55.634 --> 18:57.094
I get it.

18:58.220 --> 19:01.473
So you brought your entire family

19:01.890 --> 19:03.851
to beg me, is that it?

19:05.185 --> 19:06.186
No, it's not that.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.272
Don't worry.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.399
I won't ask you anymore.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.448
What should I do with her...

19:24.621 --> 19:26.248
Look at these flowers.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.292
Eun-seong.

19:32.212 --> 19:34.047
-Be careful.
-How did you find me?

19:34.756 --> 19:37.050
Where else could you have gone?

19:37.926 --> 19:39.428
Do I have to repeat myself?

19:40.387 --> 19:41.930
I won't get the surgery.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.849
I know. I get it.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.143
Then why did you come?

19:46.768 --> 19:48.145
Don't worry.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.731
I have someone looking for a place
for me to live in,

19:50.814 --> 19:52.149
and I've already found a caregiver.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.610
The hospital is close, too.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.695
It's just a boat ride away.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.658
Why won't you believe me?

20:02.618 --> 20:04.077
I'm at peace now.

20:04.745 --> 20:05.746
I like it.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.165
As soon as I returned to my hometown,

20:08.749 --> 20:10.959
I finally felt alive!

20:12.461 --> 20:13.545
Just go back, please.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.048
Look, Mom. Ms. Oh.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.346
Can't you imagine how terrible
and frustrated I feel right now?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.437
I came to give you my final gift.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.191
You said your wish was
to take a family picture.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.485
Your son, daughter-in-law,
and granddaughter are here.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.237
Let's all take a picture together.

20:38.654 --> 20:39.988
A family picture, just like you said.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.449
Ji-hun.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.826
It may be a fake family,

20:46.411 --> 20:47.871
but it's still a family.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.416
It does seem a bit silly.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.002
You're not my legal mom,

20:56.255 --> 20:58.507
and she's my legal wife.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.474
I won't make you go back with me,
so let's spend the day together.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.317
How pretty.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.528
What do you do every night?

21:19.611 --> 21:21.571
Why are you dozing off all day?

21:21.863 --> 21:23.949
I wasn't dozing off.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.325
Stop dozing off.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.452
Oh, my. Hello.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.204
Is Mr. Han in?

21:29.288 --> 21:31.331
Mr. Han went on a business trip.

21:32.749 --> 21:33.750
A business trip?

21:34.001 --> 21:35.002
Yes.

21:37.045 --> 21:38.046
Thanks.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.298
You're welcome.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.473
Where's Kang Hye-su?

21:48.765 --> 21:50.058
May I see her?

21:50.267 --> 21:52.060
Oh, she's been dispatched somewhere else.

21:52.394 --> 21:53.770
She won't be coming here for a while.

21:54.187 --> 21:55.397
She was dispatched somewhere else?

21:55.564 --> 21:57.399
Yes. She was sent to a hotel
in Jeju Island.

21:57.649 --> 21:58.775
Hye-su?

21:59.234 --> 22:01.278
She went out this morning with Mr. Han.

22:01.653 --> 22:02.654
What?

22:02.779 --> 22:04.531
-Where to?
-Who knows?

22:04.656 --> 22:07.075
Maybe he's taking her
to her new workplace or something.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.329
They packed some bags
and got in the car with the kid, too.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.497
Oh, my gosh. I knew it.

22:12.581 --> 22:13.874
Stop that.

22:13.957 --> 22:16.293
Stop talking nonsense.

22:17.586 --> 22:18.587
He...

22:19.921 --> 22:20.922
He was mistaken.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.341
I was not mistaken.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.009
I have perfect vision.

22:24.885 --> 22:25.886
But...

22:26.053 --> 22:27.554
Why are you winking at me?

22:27.637 --> 22:30.390
Did something get in your eye?
Come here. I'll blow on it for you.

22:31.767 --> 22:32.768
He was mistaken...

22:34.519 --> 22:35.520
I'll come back another time.

22:36.438 --> 22:37.439
Yes.

22:37.814 --> 22:38.815
Goodbye.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.902
-Gosh.
-Come here. I'll blow on it.

22:41.985 --> 22:44.529
Perfect vision?
Are you an eagle or something?

22:53.080 --> 22:55.540
Ji-hun and I are getting back together.

22:57.793 --> 22:58.794
You are?

22:59.127 --> 23:00.837
Is that a problem?

23:01.546 --> 23:02.589
No, not at all.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.257
Congratulations.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.435
That punk

23:15.519 --> 23:17.687
just loves swapping girls.

23:17.771 --> 23:20.607
You need to play with me too to be fair.

23:20.690 --> 23:22.275
How much do you want?

23:22.359 --> 23:24.444
How much do I need to give you?

23:24.528 --> 23:25.737
How much?

23:29.616 --> 23:30.909
Why you...

23:33.161 --> 23:34.788
-How dare you hit your big brother?
-Come here.

23:34.871 --> 23:35.997
-Stop it.
-Let go!

23:46.091 --> 23:49.261
-We are the Eunsu Duo!
-We are the Eunsu Duo!

23:50.971 --> 23:52.973
Ready, set, go.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.793
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.839
Mom, are we sleeping here tonight?

24:26.089 --> 24:27.174
Of course.

24:27.340 --> 24:29.009
Yes! I'm so excited.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.220
Your food is here.

24:32.345 --> 24:34.514
-Bring it over.
-There you go.

24:34.598 --> 24:35.599
Here.

24:36.016 --> 24:38.059
-Ta-da.
-Oh, my.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.144
There you go.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.897
Gosh, your daughter is so cute.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.732
Let's see who she looks like.

24:44.482 --> 24:47.444
You look like your dad.
Right? You look like him, right?

24:48.195 --> 24:49.738
Maybe you look like Grandma, too.

24:50.363 --> 24:53.617
Grandma must be from Seoul.
She looks so classy.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.243
-Your granddaughter is so cute.
-Yes.

24:55.368 --> 24:57.412
She must be your pride and joy.

24:57.495 --> 24:58.788
What a lovely family.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.500
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy your food.

25:04.628 --> 25:05.879
I'll get going now.

25:06.254 --> 25:07.505
I'm tired. Let me get some rest.

25:17.807 --> 25:18.642
Good girl.

25:18.767 --> 25:19.851
How did the surgery go?

25:20.143 --> 25:21.144
Did it go well?

25:21.353 --> 25:22.270
Well,

25:22.729 --> 25:23.730
the thing is,

25:24.773 --> 25:26.524
the surgery was pushed back.

25:26.983 --> 25:28.235
The surgery was pushed back?

25:28.485 --> 25:29.361
Why?

25:30.278 --> 25:31.404
Well...

25:32.280 --> 25:33.531
Is something wrong?

25:35.492 --> 25:37.535
Are those jerks being shady?

25:38.870 --> 25:40.622
Why else would they delay the surgery?

25:40.872 --> 25:43.250
She should just say she won't do it, then.

25:44.167 --> 25:46.419
Hye-su is so stupid.

25:46.795 --> 25:49.673
Let her tell you herself, okay? Sorry.

25:52.717 --> 25:54.427
Is Hye-su getting surgery?

25:56.429 --> 25:57.430
Did you hear?

25:57.931 --> 25:59.182
What is it for?

26:00.225 --> 26:01.226
Is she sick?

26:01.309 --> 26:02.310
No.

26:02.852 --> 26:04.562
It's like an appendectomy.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.108
What kind of an appendectomy takes
ten days?

26:08.525 --> 26:09.526
Who said ten days?

26:09.609 --> 26:12.737
Eun-seong said last time that her mom
was going on a business trip for ten days.

26:13.697 --> 26:16.574
I see. She's getting surgery.

26:18.285 --> 26:19.286
What is it for?

26:19.953 --> 26:21.246
What's wrong with her?

26:21.621 --> 26:22.622
Nothing.

26:24.457 --> 26:25.458
Tell me.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.252
Does she have a terminal illness?

26:27.502 --> 26:28.795
No, she doesn't.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.548
Tell me. Why can't you tell me?

26:32.632 --> 26:35.427
Even with appendectomies,
it can take ten days if it's serious.

26:35.719 --> 26:36.845
You don't know anything.

26:40.056 --> 26:41.057
Surgery...

26:43.184 --> 26:44.185
Mr. Han.

26:44.894 --> 26:45.979
You're here.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.647
How is your health?

26:47.856 --> 26:48.940
It's all right.

26:49.107 --> 26:52.444
I haven't held a golf club in a while.
My hands are shaking.

26:53.903 --> 26:55.363
Your dad is insisting

26:55.739 --> 26:57.657
that we go golfing next week.

26:58.783 --> 27:00.577
What can I do with this body?

27:01.369 --> 27:04.039
I'll just have to watch.
Come and sit down.

27:09.669 --> 27:11.379
So, what's going on?

27:11.796 --> 27:13.882
I'm sorry for dropping in without notice.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.092
Is it about Ji-hun?

27:18.303 --> 27:20.305
I wish you'd tell me everything.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.975
What's going on with Ji-hun?

27:24.059 --> 27:25.977
And what is he doing with that woman?

27:26.603 --> 27:29.397
Has he not told you anything yet?

27:29.731 --> 27:31.858
Please tell me everything.
I'd like to know.

27:34.611 --> 27:36.237
They're together right now.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.073
I'm the only one
who doesn't know anything.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.158
I feel like a fool.

27:40.283 --> 27:42.494
The two of them are together right now?

27:57.258 --> 27:59.636
It's fine. Go outside and rest.

28:00.261 --> 28:01.388
I want to take a nap.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.537
Grandma seems to be in a bad mood.

28:26.121 --> 28:27.372
What should we do?

28:27.997 --> 28:29.124
I don't know.

28:29.707 --> 28:31.501
How should we make her feel better?

28:33.128 --> 28:35.588
-I have a good idea.
-What is it?

28:35.672 --> 28:37.966
Mom, where's your makeup?

28:38.717 --> 28:39.634
My makeup?

28:42.470 --> 28:43.471
Here.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.019
-Here it is.
-What are you doing?

28:51.813 --> 28:52.814
Why?

28:55.859 --> 28:57.652
I said, go.

29:12.041 --> 29:13.042
She laughed.

29:16.963 --> 29:19.257
Grandma, shall I tell you a funny story?

29:19.674 --> 29:22.510
I'm a little tired,
so I need to take a nap.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.805
Eun-seong. One, two, three.

29:26.431 --> 29:27.265
Here we go.

29:27.682 --> 29:28.600
Oh my.

29:29.851 --> 29:32.520
Eun-seong, tell her lots of fun stories.

29:32.687 --> 29:34.981
I'll go and get us some snacks and drinks.

29:35.356 --> 29:38.026
Okay, I will. Come back soon.

29:40.779 --> 29:41.821
I'll be right back.

29:41.988 --> 29:43.031
Your face.

29:45.408 --> 29:46.367
Who drew this?

29:47.285 --> 29:49.370
-Did you draw that?
-Yes.

29:49.996 --> 29:51.790
You're such a good artist.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.671
-Hello.
-Hi.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.813
How much is this?

30:15.146 --> 30:17.440
-It's 5,000 won.
-Okay. Here you go.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.796
-Thank you. Have a nice day.
-Thank you.

30:44.801 --> 30:45.802
I'll take that.

30:46.052 --> 30:47.387
It's fine. It isn't heavy.

30:48.054 --> 30:49.389
Are you Cutie or Chubby?

30:50.139 --> 30:51.140
Pardon?

31:01.109 --> 31:02.110
Do you have any...

31:09.909 --> 31:10.910
Thank you.

31:10.994 --> 31:11.995
Stay still.

31:14.873 --> 31:15.874
I'll do it.

31:16.499 --> 31:17.917
Stay still.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.211
-It hurts. I'll do it.
-It isn't coming off.

31:22.755 --> 31:23.756
What...

31:23.882 --> 31:25.300
I said I'll do it.

31:25.383 --> 31:26.384
-Stay still.
-Stop.

31:26.467 --> 31:27.969
That's gross.

31:28.219 --> 31:29.095
Gosh!

31:29.178 --> 31:30.763
It's okay. It'll be fine.

31:35.935 --> 31:37.020
-Hye-su.
-Yes?

31:38.479 --> 31:40.023
Why did you buy so little?

31:40.648 --> 31:41.649
Do you like snacks?

31:42.525 --> 31:44.402
That's not it, but there are four of us.

31:44.986 --> 31:46.863
-Should I buy some more?
-No, stop.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.241
Well...

31:52.368 --> 31:53.494
Do you want to eat one?

31:54.120 --> 31:56.372
You must like them. I'll be right back.

31:56.497 --> 31:57.498
It's okay.

31:58.249 --> 31:59.500
You can't take a joke.

32:00.001 --> 32:02.295
I don't like snacks.
I'm not Eun-seong, you know.

32:08.259 --> 32:09.928
Why do you walk so quickly?

32:10.303 --> 32:11.888
Are you an athlete or something?

32:13.056 --> 32:14.807
Eun-seong is waiting.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.645
I was actually an athlete in school.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.104
You saw right.

32:20.438 --> 32:21.898
Which sport?

32:22.565 --> 32:23.733
Running.

32:24.692 --> 32:27.737
I grew up by the sea, too.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.406
I used to run
whenever I was in a bad mood.

32:31.699 --> 32:33.534
Do you know the cartoon character
Speedy Gonzales?

32:33.826 --> 32:36.287
They used to call me "Speedy Hye-su."

32:36.579 --> 32:38.039
Nonsense.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.416
You don't believe me?

32:42.085 --> 32:43.419
Do you want to race?

32:44.671 --> 32:46.965
Whoever reaches the shoreline first

32:47.840 --> 32:50.385
-gets to flick the other on the forehead.
-Are you a kid?

32:51.719 --> 32:53.012
Hey, wait!

33:01.688 --> 33:02.689
What is that?

33:07.652 --> 33:09.195
You got a head start.

33:17.453 --> 33:19.288
-Come on.
-Enough.

33:19.747 --> 33:20.957
Come on.

33:21.290 --> 33:22.291
I'm tired.

33:22.750 --> 33:23.751
I'm too tired.

33:24.335 --> 33:25.336
I'm Speedy Hye-su.

33:26.045 --> 33:28.047
-Because of that dog...
-What?

33:28.131 --> 33:29.173
Because of that dog...

33:29.257 --> 33:30.591
You can't even speak properly.

33:33.386 --> 33:34.387
One more time?

33:34.762 --> 33:35.763
-No.
-Are you okay?

33:36.347 --> 33:37.348
I'm so exhausted.

33:38.766 --> 33:39.892
Do you need help?

33:41.352 --> 33:42.270
Gosh.

33:47.608 --> 33:48.609
-Oh, my.
-Oh, gosh.

33:56.492 --> 33:58.286
You're not good at anything.

33:58.369 --> 34:00.747
You can't run and you can't make ramyeon.

34:05.376 --> 34:06.461
Gosh.

34:10.465 --> 34:11.466
Stop laughing.

34:12.383 --> 34:13.384
Okay.

34:28.107 --> 34:29.108
It's spring.

34:29.984 --> 34:30.985
It is.

34:51.047 --> 34:53.299
They'll think we went all the way to Seoul
to buy snacks.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.138
I should head back now.

35:21.202 --> 35:24.872
Where should I take you next, Master?

35:24.997 --> 35:26.040
That way.

35:26.332 --> 35:28.417
-Eun-seong.
-Yes, Master.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.044
-Master.
-Eun-seong.

35:30.169 --> 35:31.420
-Eun-seong.
-What?

35:31.504 --> 35:32.672
-I'm so sorry.
-Why?

35:32.755 --> 35:34.882
-Oh, gosh.
-You can't do that to Grandma. She's sick.

35:35.049 --> 35:37.593
Why? Don't scold her.

35:38.052 --> 35:40.012
It was my idea.

35:40.221 --> 35:43.182
Eun-seong, do you want to play
a word game?

35:43.266 --> 35:44.308
Okay. Let's do it.

35:44.851 --> 35:46.686
-Sea
-A word that starts with "a"?

35:46.769 --> 35:48.437
-Apple.
-Elephant.

35:49.188 --> 35:52.400
-Tickle
-A word that start with "e"?

35:52.483 --> 35:53.359
Egg!

35:53.860 --> 35:54.902
Ghost.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.821
"Ghost"?

35:57.446 --> 35:58.781
-What starts with...
-Tight!

36:00.032 --> 36:01.492
-I was about to--
-Trouble!

36:02.451 --> 36:03.703
Trouble? A word with "e" again?

36:04.537 --> 36:06.247
Another word...

36:06.330 --> 36:08.583
She sure is in trouble.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.334
Wait...

36:10.418 --> 36:12.712
Ear!

36:12.837 --> 36:13.963
-It has to start with "r"?
-Yes.

36:14.046 --> 36:15.381
-Rare!
-"Rare"?

36:15.464 --> 36:17.216
A word that begins with "e" again?

36:17.341 --> 36:20.261
Why do you keep giving me words
that end with "e"?

36:22.430 --> 36:23.848
-Ferry!
-What ferry?

36:24.724 --> 36:28.269
Oh, ferry. A word that starts with "y"?
What is there that starts...

36:28.352 --> 36:30.521
-Yellow.
-Yes! Yellow.

36:41.949 --> 36:44.994
Eun-seong, Grandma is tired.
Let's wash and go to bed.

36:45.077 --> 36:46.871
Here is your dessert.

36:46.954 --> 36:48.456
Did you enjoy your dinner?

36:48.539 --> 36:50.750
I should've given it to Grandma first.

36:50.917 --> 36:51.751
Thank you.

36:51.959 --> 36:54.754
Excuse me.
Could you please take a picture for us?

36:55.171 --> 36:56.881
My mom wants a family picture.

36:57.506 --> 36:59.258
She says it's a must at places like this.

36:59.634 --> 37:00.801
She's so corny.

37:00.885 --> 37:01.886
Of course, here.

37:02.261 --> 37:03.304
Come forward.

37:03.679 --> 37:05.348
I'm good at taking pictures.

37:06.098 --> 37:07.141
Let's go.

37:07.391 --> 37:10.603
-She looks cuter the more I see her.
-Thank you.

37:11.187 --> 37:12.188
Grandma.

37:13.439 --> 37:15.733
-Okay. Here we go.
-Okay.

37:15.816 --> 37:18.527
Say cheese. Smile.

37:18.861 --> 37:21.113
You need to smile.

37:21.530 --> 37:22.865
-Smile.
-You too.

37:23.282 --> 37:24.367
-Smile.
-All right.

37:25.117 --> 37:26.744
Get closer.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.330
Okay, here we go.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.290
One, two.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.253
One more.

37:39.215 --> 37:40.758
-Take a look.
-Okay.

37:43.594 --> 37:44.637
Let's see.

37:44.971 --> 37:47.598
Nice. They look good.

37:48.474 --> 37:50.434
Everyone is so good-looking.

37:50.559 --> 37:52.061
Look. Don't they look good?

37:53.854 --> 37:54.855
Grandma.

37:55.356 --> 37:56.357
Go to sleep.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.660
Eun-seong, let's go to bed.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.250
Hye-su.

38:17.712 --> 38:18.713
Hye-su?

38:23.634 --> 38:24.635
Are you asleep?

38:28.556 --> 38:29.557
What is it?

38:32.351 --> 38:33.436
Well...

38:35.354 --> 38:36.564
Do you want some beer?

38:38.441 --> 38:39.442
No.

38:42.862 --> 38:44.155
Thank you for earlier.

38:46.073 --> 38:47.325
The pictures came out nicely.

38:52.288 --> 38:53.289
See?

38:53.831 --> 38:55.041
You're right.

38:55.958 --> 38:57.376
NA-YOON

39:04.592 --> 39:05.593
Goodnight, then.

39:17.980 --> 39:18.981
Hi, Na-yoon.

39:34.413 --> 39:36.248
Good job today, Eun-seong.

39:48.886 --> 39:50.346
I heard you're on a business trip.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.056
How is it going?

39:52.640 --> 39:53.641
It's going okay.

39:54.308 --> 39:56.102
Ji-hun, the truth is,

39:56.644 --> 39:58.062
your dad told me everything

39:58.437 --> 39:59.730
about your mom.

40:01.315 --> 40:03.567
He told me about the situation
with that woman.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.445
It must have been so hard for you.

40:07.154 --> 40:08.406
When are you coming back?

40:08.989 --> 40:09.990
I'll be back soon.

40:10.533 --> 40:12.326
Did you go on your business trip

40:13.619 --> 40:14.662
by yourself?

40:17.665 --> 40:18.833
Is your daughter sleeping?

40:19.291 --> 40:20.501
Well...

40:20.584 --> 40:23.254
We fried some kelp.
Give them to your daughter.

40:27.508 --> 40:28.926
I'll call you when I'm back.

40:31.554 --> 40:32.555
What's wrong?

40:32.763 --> 40:33.764
What?

40:34.723 --> 40:35.724
Nothing.

40:53.367 --> 40:54.827
-What's wrong?
-Sleep.

40:55.744 --> 40:56.745
Sleep.

41:38.204 --> 41:39.205
It's okay.

41:41.874 --> 41:43.083
Everything is okay.

41:45.419 --> 41:46.462
It's okay.

42:02.645 --> 42:03.896
Is the kid asleep?

42:05.898 --> 42:06.899
She is.

42:09.109 --> 42:10.110
Ji-hun.

42:11.904 --> 42:13.781
Forget it. Don't start.

42:14.114 --> 42:15.407
Just go to sleep.

42:15.866 --> 42:18.661
Don't try so hard. You've done enough.

42:19.912 --> 42:21.413
Thank you.

42:22.248 --> 42:24.792
Thank you to the both of you.

42:26.168 --> 42:28.003
Thank you for the family picture.

42:28.879 --> 42:29.880
But you know,

42:31.090 --> 42:32.925
I won't change my mind.

42:35.511 --> 42:36.554
This time,

42:38.305 --> 42:41.809
I realized how ridiculous
my life has been.

42:42.101 --> 42:43.477
You just realized that?

42:44.103 --> 42:45.604
I know, right?

42:47.314 --> 42:50.484
I worked so hard to build a castle,
but it was just a sand castle.

42:51.527 --> 42:53.904
One touch, and it crumbled.

42:56.323 --> 42:59.326
What was I living for?

43:02.538 --> 43:03.539
Ji-hun.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.250
You know,

43:08.043 --> 43:11.755
I thought I loved your dad a great deal.

43:12.214 --> 43:13.549
I needed to think that

43:14.758 --> 43:16.510
in order to survive.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.430
No matter how much I hated him,

43:20.598 --> 43:22.891
I'd think that he didn't really mean it

43:23.684 --> 43:26.687
and that he truly loved me.

43:27.938 --> 43:29.398
That's what I believed.

43:31.191 --> 43:32.192
But...

43:33.235 --> 43:34.570
I realize now

43:35.112 --> 43:38.365
just how delusional I had been.

43:39.491 --> 43:41.493
I came to my senses.

43:42.077 --> 43:43.078
My goodness.

43:43.704 --> 43:45.623
That wretched love.

43:47.166 --> 43:48.292
Goodness.

43:50.336 --> 43:53.505
I lived my entire life blaming others
and making excuses.

43:54.381 --> 43:57.468
I had been a leech, just as your dad said.

43:58.719 --> 44:00.346
I didn't live my life for myself.

44:01.680 --> 44:04.058
I lived for you dad

44:04.141 --> 44:06.101
and then I started to live for you.

44:07.811 --> 44:10.522
Why did I do that? Why?

44:12.566 --> 44:13.817
This time,

44:15.235 --> 44:17.321
if I get my surgery on the condition

44:17.404 --> 44:19.323
that I cut all ties with you,

44:23.369 --> 44:26.246
my remaining days would be pure hell.

44:28.374 --> 44:30.501
Do I still have to live,
even if it's like that?

44:30.584 --> 44:32.169
Because living is still better?

44:38.759 --> 44:39.760
Ji-hun.

44:41.053 --> 44:42.429
Even if I live for just one day,

44:43.430 --> 44:45.140
isn't it better to live my own life

44:45.766 --> 44:49.520
than to live ten years as a leech?

44:51.438 --> 44:55.192
Must I live as the evil witch
who used her son to live?

44:56.652 --> 44:57.820
If I do,

44:58.654 --> 45:00.697
how is that different
from how I lived in the past?

45:01.323 --> 45:04.326
-Mom.
-Don't ask me to go back.

45:05.202 --> 45:06.703
I'm going to live here.

45:07.955 --> 45:10.165
Even if it's for a few months,

45:10.374 --> 45:12.126
I want to live a life

45:13.377 --> 45:15.170
that is wholly mine.

45:16.046 --> 45:17.923
I want to be happy before I die.

45:20.050 --> 45:21.051
Ji-hun.

45:23.053 --> 45:24.721
You saved me.

45:26.849 --> 45:27.891
You really...

45:29.059 --> 45:30.436
You saved me.

45:48.579 --> 45:50.330
They're together right now.

45:55.294 --> 45:56.295
Dad.

45:57.713 --> 45:59.256
Come in when I tell you to.

46:00.048 --> 46:01.049
Ji-hun took off

46:01.508 --> 46:03.760
without telling anyone.
He didn't show up to work.

46:05.512 --> 46:06.930
I sent him on that business trip.

46:07.014 --> 46:09.141
-What?
-I sent him away on business.

46:09.683 --> 46:11.059
Leave and go to sleep.

46:13.228 --> 46:14.229
Dad,

46:15.105 --> 46:16.690
I heard a strange rumor.

46:17.274 --> 46:18.901
May I ask you if it's true?

46:19.193 --> 46:20.194
What is it?

46:20.360 --> 46:23.238
I heard that Ji-hun will be promoted.

46:31.121 --> 46:33.123
That's for the board to decide.

46:33.874 --> 46:34.875
I don't know about it.

46:35.209 --> 46:37.503
How could you not know?

46:39.213 --> 46:40.214
Dad!

46:41.131 --> 46:42.132
Dad.

46:43.133 --> 46:45.302
Everyone is complaining, Dad.

46:45.385 --> 46:47.513
They're saying it's nepotism.

46:48.931 --> 46:50.766
Jeong-hun, go upstairs.

47:01.902 --> 47:03.904
Why are you so angry?

47:04.321 --> 47:05.531
Pour me a glass.

47:06.698 --> 47:07.741
Pour it yourself.

47:07.824 --> 47:09.910
Give me a glass of water.

47:14.706 --> 47:17.042
When we were young, you gave me
a hard time because of Oh Mi-ran.

47:17.543 --> 47:20.003
Now that you're old, you favor her child.

47:20.921 --> 47:23.090
Why would I want to pour you
a glass of water?

47:23.715 --> 47:24.883
Gosh.

47:25.050 --> 47:27.553
You are terrible.

47:28.929 --> 47:31.515
Rumors are rampant
that you're leaving everything to Ji-hun.

47:31.932 --> 47:33.058
What's he to you?

47:33.308 --> 47:35.727
He partied around
playing his guitar until now

47:35.978 --> 47:37.896
and just started working at the company.

47:38.146 --> 47:39.606
Who's leaving whom what?

47:39.731 --> 47:42.734
I have no plans yet.
The company isn't personal property.

47:42.943 --> 47:45.404
People will think you're ignorant.

47:47.406 --> 47:49.908
I lived my entire life waiting.

47:50.367 --> 47:52.578
I can't take it anymore.

47:53.328 --> 47:54.746
Let me make this clear.

47:55.706 --> 47:57.416
The eldest son of this family
is Jeong-hun.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.460
Ji-hun is Mi-ran's son.

48:01.128 --> 48:03.088
If the son she didn't even raise
takes everything,

48:03.422 --> 48:05.132
how happy would that witch be?

48:06.091 --> 48:08.051
She must be laughing at me right now.

48:10.470 --> 48:12.264
It makes my blood boil.

48:13.223 --> 48:14.558
Don't worry.

48:14.891 --> 48:18.520
Mi-ran can't laugh at you.

48:20.105 --> 48:21.648
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

48:21.857 --> 48:22.941
She's dying.

48:23.233 --> 48:24.359
Stop whining.

48:26.361 --> 48:28.238
-What?
-She's dying.

48:28.530 --> 48:29.531
She'll die soon.

48:30.073 --> 48:31.074
Happy now?

48:54.431 --> 48:55.682
Where's the chef?

48:55.891 --> 48:57.100
He left earlier.

48:57.476 --> 48:58.518
Hello.

48:58.685 --> 48:59.936
Hey, it's...

49:00.854 --> 49:03.982
Ji-hun hasn't come back
from his business trip yet.

49:04.191 --> 49:05.275
That's not it.

49:05.400 --> 49:07.277
Please tell me where he went.

49:07.486 --> 49:08.570
You know, don't you?

49:09.363 --> 49:12.240
I know everything that's going on,
so please tell me.

49:13.158 --> 49:15.118
The thing is...

49:15.202 --> 49:16.203
Where is he?

49:17.204 --> 49:19.289
I heard he went to look for his mom.

49:20.248 --> 49:21.249
Where is he?

49:26.046 --> 49:27.047
Well...

49:51.905 --> 49:53.740
What do you think you're doing?

49:55.200 --> 49:56.201
Get over here.

50:03.333 --> 50:05.877
What happened with your mom's surgery?

50:06.336 --> 50:08.630
Why is she suddenly here being like that?

50:09.715 --> 50:12.050
What did you mean
when you said you won't ask me?

50:12.134 --> 50:13.885
And why do you suddenly have a wife?

50:14.386 --> 50:15.887
When did you get married?

50:17.264 --> 50:19.808
How could you have a daughter that big?

50:20.225 --> 50:21.226
Tell me.

50:22.060 --> 50:23.311
-Well--
-Did you

50:23.645 --> 50:25.897
buy your wife with money?

50:29.901 --> 50:33.739
Gosh, your expression says it all.

50:34.656 --> 50:36.533
I've been a fisherman for 30 years.

50:36.616 --> 50:38.952
I can read people like a book.
I'm right, aren't I?

50:41.329 --> 50:43.790
You even bought a person with money.

50:44.666 --> 50:46.418
That's typical of you.

50:49.337 --> 50:50.338
Yes.

50:51.423 --> 50:52.424
You're right.

50:54.342 --> 50:55.969
That's just how I am.

50:56.261 --> 50:58.513
Like mother, like son.

50:59.765 --> 51:01.141
You're ridiculous.

51:01.349 --> 51:02.809
After what you've done,

51:02.934 --> 51:04.686
you act like a perfect family.

51:05.395 --> 51:06.396
My goodness.

51:07.022 --> 51:08.273
You fooled me.

51:08.398 --> 51:10.275
You're such a good actor.

51:10.692 --> 51:12.986
I would've believed it
if you said you really liked her.

51:15.363 --> 51:16.364
Yes.

51:17.115 --> 51:18.116
You're right.

51:19.618 --> 51:20.952
I really am

51:21.578 --> 51:22.579
ridiculous.

51:23.538 --> 51:26.291
Why is your mom causing so much trouble?

51:26.625 --> 51:28.543
Where else would she find such a good son?

51:30.962 --> 51:32.756
I'm not a good son.

51:33.799 --> 51:35.842
I don't know how things got so messed up,

51:36.384 --> 51:39.387
but if you try to solve everything
with money,

51:39.971 --> 51:42.349
it will all become a total mess.

51:43.600 --> 51:44.601
Got it?

52:06.498 --> 52:07.874
-Mom.
-Yes?

52:08.041 --> 52:09.709
I need to pee.

52:09.793 --> 52:10.836
You need to pee?

52:11.837 --> 52:13.171
Let's go to the bathroom.

52:17.050 --> 52:18.051
Let's go.

52:19.511 --> 52:20.512
Get up.

52:22.430 --> 52:23.932
Are you done?

52:24.808 --> 52:26.101
Okay.

52:26.726 --> 52:27.727
Come out.

52:28.603 --> 52:29.729
It's cold.

52:31.565 --> 52:32.440
-Mom.
-Yes?

52:32.524 --> 52:34.025
Can I sleep with Grandma?

52:34.109 --> 52:35.652
No. Grandma is sleeping.

52:36.653 --> 52:37.654
Eun-seong.

52:38.029 --> 52:39.030
Eun-seong.

52:47.664 --> 52:50.917
Mom, Grandma says it's okay.

52:51.334 --> 52:52.752
She says I can sleep here.

52:53.044 --> 52:54.921
All right.

53:01.177 --> 53:03.513
Grandma, you weren't asleep?

53:04.431 --> 53:06.600
No, I couldn't sleep.

53:07.225 --> 53:09.019
Why can't you sleep?

53:11.021 --> 53:12.814
You can't sleep when you're old.

53:13.857 --> 53:16.151
I can't sleep even though I'm a kid.

53:16.735 --> 53:18.069
It's because I'm so happy.

53:18.528 --> 53:20.822
Mom came here with me

53:20.906 --> 53:22.407
instead of working.

53:22.657 --> 53:23.700
I'm so happy.

53:25.619 --> 53:27.579
Does Mom work all the time?

53:28.496 --> 53:30.582
She doesn't go on trips with you?

53:30.665 --> 53:32.751
That's right. She works all the time.

53:33.418 --> 53:35.211
She is always working.

53:35.962 --> 53:37.672
She said she needs to make money.

53:37.964 --> 53:40.800
What kind of a mom is that?

53:41.551 --> 53:43.553
She should forget about making money

53:43.637 --> 53:45.972
and go on trips with you instead.

53:46.097 --> 53:48.558
She needs to work to make money.

53:49.726 --> 53:52.854
That way, we can buy snacks

53:52.938 --> 53:54.731
and pork belly.

53:57.108 --> 53:58.401
By the way, Grandma.

53:58.568 --> 53:59.569
Yes?

53:59.986 --> 54:01.571
Where are you sick?

54:02.447 --> 54:03.615
Well...

54:04.449 --> 54:05.784
Here and there.

54:07.827 --> 54:09.371
When you get old,

54:10.163 --> 54:12.123
it hurts everywhere.

54:12.749 --> 54:14.000
Don't be sick.

54:14.751 --> 54:16.002
Don't be sick.

54:16.503 --> 54:19.214
I'll blow on it for you so that it heals.

54:25.553 --> 54:26.680
Eun-seong,

54:27.222 --> 54:28.223
you're pretty.

54:30.475 --> 54:32.185
You're so pretty.

54:33.770 --> 54:34.771
Shall I

54:35.563 --> 54:36.940
sing you a lullaby?

54:37.315 --> 54:38.316
Yes, please.

54:40.610 --> 54:41.695
This one

54:42.278 --> 54:43.363
is something I used to sing

54:43.863 --> 54:46.574
for Ji-hun when he was young.

54:50.829 --> 54:53.790
When Mom goes

54:53.873 --> 54:58.503
To the island

55:00.130 --> 55:06.636
To pick some oysters

55:09.180 --> 55:12.267
The baby stays behind

55:12.392 --> 55:16.813
Alone

55:19.232 --> 55:22.152
At home

55:22.235 --> 55:26.990
All by herself

55:28.825 --> 55:32.203
The waves

55:32.287 --> 55:36.958
Sing

55:39.085 --> 55:43.923
A lullaby

55:47.260 --> 55:48.261
What are you doing?

55:49.512 --> 55:50.847
You're still up?

55:51.848 --> 55:53.224
Why aren't you asleep?

55:54.601 --> 55:55.977
I had a headache.

55:56.436 --> 55:58.855
I guess the boat ride got me
a bit seasick.

55:59.689 --> 56:00.690
Is it bad?

56:02.025 --> 56:03.985
No, it's all better now.

56:04.819 --> 56:05.820
Go inside.

56:06.279 --> 56:08.698
You go first. I need some fresh air.

56:09.240 --> 56:10.116
Wait.

56:11.117 --> 56:12.535
The sea breeze is cold.

56:12.911 --> 56:13.912
Stay here.

56:14.662 --> 56:15.789
I'll go inside.

56:21.711 --> 56:22.712
Okay.

57:49.424 --> 57:50.425
Take this.

57:50.925 --> 57:52.802
It's okay. I'm fine now.

57:53.595 --> 57:54.596
Take it.

57:55.054 --> 57:56.723
Your face is pale.

57:57.182 --> 57:59.058
I don't want to.

58:00.018 --> 58:02.937
I might get surgery
as soon as we go back to Seoul.

58:03.480 --> 58:05.565
They said not to take any medication.

58:06.065 --> 58:07.650
I'm fine. I mean it.

58:08.985 --> 58:09.986
Let's go inside.

58:10.361 --> 58:11.488
Tomorrow morning,

58:13.865 --> 58:15.533
we'll be leaving on the first boat out.

58:15.950 --> 58:17.535
Did your mom change her mind?

58:20.413 --> 58:21.831
We'll go on our own for now.

58:22.999 --> 58:24.542
No. We need to go together.

58:24.667 --> 58:25.793
I don't have time.

58:26.461 --> 58:27.629
What do you mean?

58:29.797 --> 58:30.798
No, wait.

58:33.218 --> 58:35.094
We need to convince her.

58:35.678 --> 58:37.222
We can't go by ourselves.

58:37.555 --> 58:39.557
We came to get her.

58:40.975 --> 58:41.976
Let's just go.

58:43.645 --> 58:44.646
No.

58:46.189 --> 58:48.107
We have to take her.

58:48.691 --> 58:49.692
Hye-su.

59:05.750 --> 59:08.211
Put this on. Why did you come outside
when it's cold?

59:08.795 --> 59:09.796
I'm fine.

59:18.888 --> 59:20.306
You need to convince her.

59:21.975 --> 59:23.560
We can't go by ourselves.

59:24.894 --> 59:26.145
Mom won't

59:26.980 --> 59:27.981
get the surgery.

59:32.694 --> 59:33.695
What?

59:33.945 --> 59:35.530
Let's give up on the surgery.

59:36.573 --> 59:38.366
I'm going to follow her wishes.

59:39.993 --> 59:40.994
Why?

59:41.828 --> 59:43.538
I just want to do that for her.

59:44.747 --> 59:46.332
Are you sure you won't regret it?

59:47.166 --> 59:48.167
Don't worry.

59:52.088 --> 59:53.298
Then what about your mom?

59:53.881 --> 59:55.300
She won't change her mind.

59:56.843 --> 59:58.553
I'm the one who broke the contract,

59:59.429 --> 1:00:00.972
so I'll pay the rest of the money soon.

1:00:03.308 --> 1:00:04.309
Right.

1:00:04.809 --> 1:00:05.810
Our contract

1:00:06.853 --> 1:00:07.979
is now over.

1:00:11.941 --> 1:00:13.276
Thank you for everything.

1:00:15.320 --> 1:00:18.114
You went through so much
because of this selfish jerk.

1:00:22.368 --> 1:00:23.786
Thank you so much

1:00:24.954 --> 1:00:26.080
for coming all the way here.

1:00:27.874 --> 1:00:29.167
To be honest, I liked it.

1:00:30.877 --> 1:00:32.837
It felt like a real family vacation.

1:00:38.259 --> 1:00:39.719
We were pretty believable,

1:00:40.637 --> 1:00:41.512
weren't we?

1:00:43.973 --> 1:00:44.974
Since we're

1:00:46.142 --> 1:00:47.477
breaking up,

1:00:48.978 --> 1:00:50.271
how about we shake hands?

1:00:53.900 --> 1:00:55.943
I'm in no position to say this,

1:00:59.113 --> 1:01:00.948
but I hope you live a happy life.

1:01:06.621 --> 1:01:07.622
Here.

1:03:33.559 --> 1:03:34.602
I'm sorry, Dad.

1:03:34.727 --> 1:03:36.979
I don't think I can give her up.

1:03:37.146 --> 1:03:40.191
Do you think there will be
a shining moment in my life...

1:03:40.316 --> 1:03:42.068
at least once?

1:03:42.235 --> 1:03:46.155
You have about a 30 percent chance
of living for 5 years.

1:03:46.697 --> 1:03:48.241
What happened yesterday was a mistake.

1:03:49.116 --> 1:03:50.243
It wasn't a mistake for me.

1:03:50.493 --> 1:03:51.911
Let's just give it a try.

1:03:55.790 --> 1:03:57.875
