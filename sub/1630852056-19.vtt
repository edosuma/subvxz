WEBVTT

00:00.333 --> 00:01.367
We got engaged...

00:02.367 --> 00:04.033
Then we had a falling-apart.

00:04.100 --> 00:06.467
You had a restraining order against you?

00:06.533 --> 00:07.367
Yes, ma'am.

00:07.433 --> 00:10.967
Then you had someone else file
for a protective order against you.

00:12.133 --> 00:13.033
Uh...

00:13.100 --> 00:15.100
You are the unluckiest guy I know.

[narrator] <i>This is </i>Judy Justice.

[theme music playing]

00:35.667 --> 00:39.367
<i>Annalisa Behsman</i>

00:39.433 --> 00:42.867

00:46.633 --> 00:48.200
[Kevin] Court, come to order.

00:50.567 --> 00:52.800
[Judy] Be seated, everyone, please.

00:52.867 --> 00:57.000
Hello, Judge.
Case 1085. Behsman versus Ash, Robinson.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.767
Ms. Behsman. And your last name is...

01:00.900 --> 01:02.300
-Ash.
-[Judy] Ash. Mr. Ash

01:02.367 --> 01:04.200
is a former boyfriend of yours?

01:04.266 --> 01:05.867
-Correct.
-[Judy] Miss Robinson

01:05.934 --> 01:10.233
was his fiancee, then his ex-fiancee

01:10.300 --> 01:12.133
when he moved in with you.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.734
And is currently
his currently his current fiancee?

01:14.800 --> 01:18.000
We got married two days ago, so we're...

01:18.066 --> 01:19.166
-Well, congratulations.
-...husband and wife.

01:19.233 --> 01:21.233
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

01:21.300 --> 01:24.133
[Judy]
I don't know what the cause of action

01:24.200 --> 01:27.500
that you have is against Ms. Robinson.

01:27.567 --> 01:31.633
Because she put a stop
to me contacting Mr. Ash

01:31.700 --> 01:32.967
to get my property back.

01:33.033 --> 01:34.000
[Judy] Just a second.

01:34.066 --> 01:36.900
She had an order preventing you

01:36.967 --> 01:39.133
from contacting him or her?

01:39.200 --> 01:40.533
No. Neither.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.166
She had written in text message

01:43.233 --> 01:45.667
that if I contact him

01:45.734 --> 01:48.367
or her family at all,

01:48.433 --> 01:50.333
she will take legal action.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.166
[Judy]
Your case is dismissed against her.

01:52.233 --> 01:53.567
-Okay.
-Have a seat.

01:53.633 --> 01:55.633
I couldn't figure out
what your cause of action

01:55.700 --> 01:58.400
against her was
because you don't have one.

01:58.467 --> 02:01.800
Mr. Ash, you and your now wife

02:01.867 --> 02:04.266
were engaged and living together when?

02:04.333 --> 02:07.100
For eight years.

02:07.166 --> 02:10.066
And all that, we were together,

02:10.133 --> 02:11.734
we got engaged,

02:11.800 --> 02:14.200
then we had a falling-apart

02:14.266 --> 02:16.533
for roughly eight months.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.300
And though, I was even misplaced
from my house because of her order.

02:20.367 --> 02:21.734
[Judy] Okay. It was your house?

02:21.800 --> 02:24.100
-Yes.
-[Judy] So, your current wife

02:24.166 --> 02:25.934
had a restraining order against you?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.600
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] And the restraining order

02:27.667 --> 02:29.767
-put you out of your home?
-Yes.

02:29.834 --> 02:31.700
[Judy] And while you were
put out of your home,

02:31.767 --> 02:34.233
-you reconnected with the plaintiff.
-[Michael] Yes, ma'am.

02:34.300 --> 02:35.767
[Judy]
Who you had known in the past?

02:35.834 --> 02:36.800
Yes, ma'am.

02:36.867 --> 02:38.367
[Judy]
And asked her if you could move in,

02:38.433 --> 02:39.900
she did let you move in.

02:39.967 --> 02:41.400
You stayed for a while and then

02:41.467 --> 02:45.166
developed a romantic relationship
with each other.

02:45.233 --> 02:48.734
You hired a lawyer in order
to get back into your house?

02:48.800 --> 02:49.667
No, ma'am. I...

02:49.734 --> 02:51.633
[Judy]
How did you get back into your house?

02:51.700 --> 02:54.767
[Michael] I had gotten legal advice

02:54.834 --> 02:56.800
of how to file the proper paperwork

02:56.867 --> 02:58.300
so I could represent myself.

02:58.367 --> 03:00.266
[Judy]
Who did you get the advice from?

03:00.333 --> 03:04.133
Chris, um, sitting next to her.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.734
-[Judy] Plaintiff's witness?
-[Michael] Correct.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.734
[Judy] Did you get the advice
from her because that's her profession?

03:08.800 --> 03:12.367
-She is a paralegal of some sort?
-No, ma'am.

03:12.433 --> 03:14.900
-Was the advice free?
-No.

03:14.967 --> 03:16.867
[Judy]
What did she charge you for it?

03:16.934 --> 03:20.133
[Michael] For the first initial
to get back in my house, $250.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.800
[Judy] And in what month was that?

03:21.867 --> 03:23.266
November of last year.

03:23.333 --> 03:26.533
And then you had someone else file
for a protective order against you?

03:26.600 --> 03:27.800
Yes, ma'am.

03:27.867 --> 03:29.300
And who was that?

03:29.367 --> 03:33.900
Ex-girlfriend times two
before Ms. Robinson.

03:33.967 --> 03:36.467
You are the unluckiest guy
I know, Mr. Ash.

03:36.533 --> 03:37.667
-Yes, ma'am.
-[audience laughs]

03:37.734 --> 03:41.033
[Judy] And did again,
you used the plaintiff's witness

03:41.100 --> 03:43.100
to help you with that situation?

03:43.166 --> 03:44.266
Yes, ma'am.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.033
[Judy]
And what was her fee for that?

03:46.100 --> 03:47.200
Twelve hundred dollars.

03:47.266 --> 03:50.533
[Judy] And all of this transpired
while you were living with the plaintiff?

03:50.600 --> 03:51.467
[Michael] No, ma'am.

03:51.533 --> 03:53.400
The 250 happened

03:53.467 --> 03:56.433
while I was staying in Duluth, Minnesota

03:56.500 --> 03:57.667
-with the Ms. Behsman's.
-With the plaintiff?

03:57.734 --> 04:00.567
[Michael] The 1,200,
I was back in my house at that time.

04:00.633 --> 04:02.266
[Judy] Were you back in your house

04:02.333 --> 04:05.834
and still connected to Ms. Behsman?

04:05.900 --> 04:06.867
Yes, ma'am.

04:06.934 --> 04:08.200
[Judy] Okay.
So, you were still together with her?

04:08.266 --> 04:09.200
Yes, ma'am.

04:09.266 --> 04:12.867
[Judy]
And where did you get the 1,450 from?

04:12.934 --> 04:14.834
Did Ms. Behsman give you that money?

04:14.900 --> 04:16.367
-[Michael] Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] Okay.

04:16.433 --> 04:17.300
So, I want you to tell...

04:17.367 --> 04:19.600
because that's part
of what she's suing you for.

04:19.667 --> 04:20.633
[Michael] Yes, ma'am.

04:20.700 --> 04:23.567
Tell me the circumstances
surrounding her giving you that money.

04:23.633 --> 04:28.400
[Michael] She thought that me being
legally bound by these people,

04:28.467 --> 04:32.000
that I shouldn't have to go through this,
that she was going to help me

04:32.066 --> 04:35.767
get through this
with paying for legal advice.

04:35.834 --> 04:37.834
And what were you doing at the time?

04:37.900 --> 04:39.633
Not working, ma'am.

04:39.700 --> 04:41.667
How weee you supporting yourself?

04:41.734 --> 04:43.400
I am currently still unemployed.

04:43.467 --> 04:44.867
[Judy]
How were you supporting yourself?

04:44.934 --> 04:46.300
The basic system.

04:46.367 --> 04:48.066
[Judy]
Well, tell me exactly what that is.

04:48.133 --> 04:50.300
I'd like to know what
the basic system is for you.

04:50.367 --> 04:52.567
We've been here doing this
for a couple of months.

04:52.633 --> 04:55.100
We've had so many stories
about the basic system.

04:55.166 --> 04:57.834
I want to know what your basic system is.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.233
I received MFIP
from the State of Minnesota.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.533
What is that?

05:01.600 --> 05:02.834
[Michael] Parent and child,

05:02.900 --> 05:06.667
they give you so much cash,
food support, medical.

05:06.734 --> 05:09.433
I also receive child support for my son.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.433
Okay. So, you have one child?

05:11.500 --> 05:13.400
When you lived with Ms. Behsman,

05:13.467 --> 05:15.033
-did you take your son with you?
-No, ma'am.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.266
[Judy] Where did he stay?

05:16.333 --> 05:19.200
The same town, across town with his aunt.

05:19.266 --> 05:22.667
Were you still getting money for him
when he was living with his aunt?

05:22.734 --> 05:24.233
-[Michael] Yes, ma'am.
-How much?

05:24.300 --> 05:25.567
Three hundred bucks a month.

05:25.633 --> 05:27.967
And how much were you getting
personally for yourself?

05:28.033 --> 05:29.400
In child support, none.

05:29.467 --> 05:31.934
I don't receive any, uh...

05:32.000 --> 05:33.033
Not child support.

05:33.100 --> 05:36.066
I'm talking about any other...
so, you--you're not supporting yourself

05:36.133 --> 05:38.533
-on $300 a month, sir?
-No.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.934
[Judy] So, what other monies
do you get from any source?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.500
-[Michael] At, oh, MFIP.
-Well, tell me how much you get.

05:43.567 --> 05:46.700
[Michael] MFIP varies from 150

05:46.767 --> 05:49.700
maybe 250 depending on how much
child support came in that month.

05:49.767 --> 05:52.800
A hundred and fifty to two hundred
and fifty a what, a week, a month?

05:52.867 --> 05:54.266
-A month.
-[Judy] A month?

05:54.333 --> 05:56.700
When was the last time you were employed?

05:56.767 --> 05:58.000
Five years ago.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.800
[Judy] What kind of work
did you do five years ago?

05:59.867 --> 06:01.400
[Michael] I was a courier driver.

06:01.467 --> 06:03.000
And what stopped that?

06:03.066 --> 06:05.433
Too many accidents,
workman comp cases,

06:05.500 --> 06:08.133
and eventually my employer got tired

06:08.200 --> 06:11.033
and said we are two open cases
and dismissed me.

06:11.100 --> 06:13.633
-And that was five years ago?
-Yes.

06:13.700 --> 06:14.967
[Judy] Well, how
have you been supporting yourself

06:15.033 --> 06:16.867
for the last five years?
I'm gonna--I'm not gonna ask you.

06:16.934 --> 06:18.367
I'm gonna ask the plaintiff.

06:18.433 --> 06:19.567
-How does he support himself?
-[Annalisa] He...

06:19.633 --> 06:22.100
He has his own home
because it was his home

06:22.166 --> 06:25.333
that he was put out of,
so I assume you own that home?

06:25.400 --> 06:26.367
-No, ma'am.
-No.

06:26.433 --> 06:27.734
-[Judy] You rent it?
-Yes.

06:27.800 --> 06:31.133
-[Judy] How much is your rent?
-Subsidized renting $60 a month.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.767
Describe the house for me.

06:32.834 --> 06:35.834
It is a two-bedroom townhome.

06:35.900 --> 06:37.266
[Judy] Two bedroom, two bath?

06:37.333 --> 06:38.633
Two bedroom, one bath.

06:38.700 --> 06:40.567
For which you pay $60 a month?

06:40.633 --> 06:42.967
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] Have you applied for

06:43.033 --> 06:45.900
any other type of federal assistance?

06:45.967 --> 06:47.900
I've been attempting to try
to get Social Security

06:47.967 --> 06:49.600
which has been just a dead end.

06:49.667 --> 06:52.767
[Judy] Because they asked you
what your disability is.

06:56.033 --> 06:58.633
You ultimately found out
that they were back together again,

06:58.700 --> 07:00.300
or at least you had a suspicion,

07:00.367 --> 07:03.300
and owing to the fact
that they got married two days ago,

07:03.367 --> 07:07.066
I would suggest to you
that your intuitions were very good.

07:07.133 --> 07:09.200
[laughter]

07:19.367 --> 07:24.200
[narrator] <i>Annalisa Behsman claims</i>
<i>her ex-boyfriend Michael Ash</i>

07:24.266 --> 07:26.500
<i>is responsible for unpaid loans</i>

07:26.567 --> 07:28.200
<i>and returning her belongings.</i>

07:28.266 --> 07:29.934
[Judy] Okay. Mr. Ash says

07:30.000 --> 07:33.433
part of your lawsuit is this $1,450

07:33.500 --> 07:35.834
that you paid to your witness.

07:35.900 --> 07:38.100
There's no issue that you paid that money

07:38.166 --> 07:39.300
to the witness because he says

07:39.367 --> 07:40.934
that you paid that money to the witness,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.266
-and you received it from her?
-Yes, I did.

07:43.333 --> 07:44.467
[Judy] When did you pay her

07:44.533 --> 07:47.967
the money for his
two domestic violence cases?

07:48.033 --> 07:50.400
It was January 11th
and then the rest was paid...

07:50.467 --> 07:52.600
-2021?
-[Annalisa] Yes.

07:52.667 --> 07:55.233
And then the rest
was paid to you in April?

07:56.100 --> 07:58.667
[Judy] Now, you had moved
a lot of your stuff,

07:58.734 --> 08:01.700
according to your complaint
after he stayed with you for a while

08:01.767 --> 08:05.333
and he was successful
in regaining his house.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.767
She got out of his townhome.

08:08.834 --> 08:12.600
You took an apartment
for you to have together?

08:12.667 --> 08:13.633
No, ma'am.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.633
I have my own house

08:15.700 --> 08:19.066
that I pay for on a monthly basis, okay?

08:19.133 --> 08:20.633
He came and stayed with me...

08:20.700 --> 08:22.233
Well, that I understand.

08:22.300 --> 08:26.433
For two weeks, then we went back
to his townhome

08:26.500 --> 08:28.433
where we were spending the weekends.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.900
Spending just the weekends?

08:29.967 --> 08:32.166
-Just the weekends.
-But he was staying there?

08:32.233 --> 08:33.800
-[Annalisa] Yes. He was staying there.
-[Judy] He was staying there,

08:33.867 --> 08:36.200
-you came and just spent weekends?
-Yes.

08:36.266 --> 08:40.700
[Judy] Well, was that between
January and April of 2021?

08:40.767 --> 08:43.266
-[Annalisa] Yes, and it continued...
-[Judy] I want...

08:43.333 --> 08:46.000
...on up until June.

08:46.066 --> 08:47.300
What happened in June?

08:47.367 --> 08:51.233
[Annalisa] June 5th
was when it started to...

08:51.300 --> 08:54.333
the relationship started to fall apart.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.133
-And at that point, I had already...
-[Judy] What gave you...

08:56.200 --> 08:57.900
what gave you a clue?

08:57.967 --> 08:59.767
[Annalisa] The fact that
Deanna Dawn Robinson

08:59.834 --> 09:01.300
was over there every day

09:01.367 --> 09:04.233
even though she had
a harassment order against him.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.967
-Just-- So, she was at the townhome?
-[Annalisa] Yes.

09:07.033 --> 09:08.467
How did you find that out?

09:08.533 --> 09:13.200
He told me one night
when we hadn't done very much talking.

09:13.266 --> 09:17.300
He said Deanna and I were up drinking
'til 3:00 in the morning.

09:17.367 --> 09:19.967
-Even when you were home in your house?
-Yes.

09:20.033 --> 09:22.433
-So, that gave you your first clue?
-[Annalisa] Yes.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.734
[Judy] Okay.
What had you brought over to his townhome?

09:25.800 --> 09:30.133
[Annalisa] I had brought
over makeup, clothing, movies.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.367
He lives about 20 minutes from me.

09:33.433 --> 09:34.700
He lives in a different city.

09:34.767 --> 09:38.233
So, I brought over food supplies

09:38.300 --> 09:41.400
because I try to do keto,
you know, everything.

09:41.467 --> 09:45.000
You understand that
this is a very expensive place

09:45.066 --> 09:46.900
-to run a court system.
-Yes.

09:46.967 --> 09:49.633
[Judy] So, we're not interested
in the food supplies you brought over

09:49.700 --> 09:51.233
or even your makeup that you brought over.

09:52.166 --> 09:55.467
Now, you ultimately found out that
they were back together again,

09:55.533 --> 09:58.367
or at least you had a suspicion,
and owing to the fact

09:58.433 --> 10:00.066
that they got married two days ago.

10:00.133 --> 10:03.567
I would suggest to you
that your intuitions were very good.

10:03.633 --> 10:05.367
[audience laughs]

10:05.433 --> 10:10.367
Tell me the circumstances surrounding
you paying these two bills for him.

10:10.433 --> 10:13.500
[Annalisa] First of all,
Chris would not do any more work for us

10:13.567 --> 10:17.400
-until she got the $250 from before.
-[Judy] Okay.

10:17.467 --> 10:20.600
[Annalisa] She was his legal researcher
more than anything.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.066
-[Judy] Before? Okay.
-[Annalisa] Okay?

10:22.133 --> 10:23.867
-He acknowledges that.
-[Annalisa] Yeah.

10:23.934 --> 10:26.300
The only question is, were you paying this

10:26.367 --> 10:29.533
because you were a couple,
and you were helping him out?

10:29.600 --> 10:32.934
Or was there a contract
between you that this was a loan?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.967
-There was a verbal contract.
-[Judy] That's what--just a second.

10:35.033 --> 10:36.533
Well, that's what you're going to tell me

10:36.600 --> 10:40.600
and that's what
I'm going to try to figure out.

10:40.667 --> 10:42.767
His explanation so far,

10:42.834 --> 10:45.166
whether I like it or not, is plausible,

10:45.233 --> 10:47.433
that you were in a relationship
with each other.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.000
There was another woman involved.

10:49.066 --> 10:53.200
You wanted him to be free
from any of those stressors

10:53.266 --> 10:55.266
from this other woman

10:55.333 --> 10:57.900
and from two previous to her who also

10:57.967 --> 10:59.767
had some sort of case against him.

10:59.834 --> 11:04.000
You don't look like that kind of guy,
Mr. Ash, but looks can be deceptive.

11:04.066 --> 11:08.133
And that you as part
of a couple paid this bill for him.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.867
You're gonna tell me that there was a loan

11:10.934 --> 11:13.166
with an expectation of being repaid.

11:13.834 --> 11:16.100
-So, let me have it.
-[Annalisa] There was a loan because...

11:16.166 --> 11:18.767
-Well, I give you--that's a conclusion.
-Yes.

11:18.834 --> 11:22.066
[Judy] I want you to tell me
the circumstances surrounding

11:22.133 --> 11:24.133
you paying Chris.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.066
[Annalisa] I paid Chris
because he was in such a state

11:27.133 --> 11:31.767
of worrying and mental anguish

11:31.834 --> 11:33.867
over the different people who were...

11:33.934 --> 11:36.166
who had harassment orders against him.

11:36.233 --> 11:37.467
He didn't know what to do.

11:37.533 --> 11:39.600
He was beside himself.

11:39.667 --> 11:42.967
So therefore, I paid her the $250

11:43.033 --> 11:45.400
with the acknowledgement that after...

11:45.467 --> 11:47.066
[Judy] Not acknowledgement.

11:47.133 --> 11:50.834
So, you were concerned about him,
you paid the $250.

11:50.900 --> 11:52.166
I'm still waiting.

11:52.233 --> 11:56.633
Welsl, the thing is, if anything,
why would I pay her the $1,200

11:56.700 --> 11:59.233
after she was done with the cases?

11:59.300 --> 12:01.266
I have to ask you this question.

12:01.333 --> 12:03.633
-You paid her the 250?
-Yes.

12:03.700 --> 12:06.166
[Judy] He never paid you
a penny towards the 250?

12:06.233 --> 12:08.100
-[Annalisa] You are correct.
-[Judy] Right.

12:08.166 --> 12:11.633
And so, after he never paid you a penny
from the 250,

12:11.700 --> 12:14.333
because he's somebody
that lives in a townhouse

12:14.400 --> 12:16.800
for which he pays $60 a month,

12:16.867 --> 12:18.166
who doesn't work.

12:18.233 --> 12:21.266
Who was going
to get a job through his friend...

12:21.333 --> 12:22.300
-Ooh, yeah.
-...making $35 an hour.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.033
Yeah, as soon as--right.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.467
He hadn't worked in five years.

12:25.533 --> 12:27.200
So, based on history,

12:27.400 --> 12:30.467
both his history of not working
for five years

12:30.533 --> 12:32.300
and your history with him together,

12:32.367 --> 12:34.467
for the months that you live together.
He never worked.

12:34.533 --> 12:37.834
[Annalisa]
I was never aware that he never worked.

12:37.900 --> 12:42.000
He had told me
that he owned his own auto shop

12:42.066 --> 12:43.967
and that he was working every day.

12:44.033 --> 12:45.200
M&M.

12:45.266 --> 12:49.233
M&M Automotive,
which is owned by he and his father.

12:49.300 --> 12:52.567
M&M Automotive, where is it located?

12:52.633 --> 12:57.600
It's located in Esko, Minnesota, E-S-K-O.

12:57.667 --> 13:00.367
While she's looking for it, Mr. Ash,

13:00.433 --> 13:04.333
-does your father own a mechanic shop?
-No.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.100
-[Judy] Did you?
-Once upon a time.

13:07.166 --> 13:08.100
When?

13:08.166 --> 13:11.233
[Michael] I haven't-- that business
has not been open in six years.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.567
There was an attempt to make
the business come open,

13:13.633 --> 13:15.700
then COVID-19 hit
and then it never reopen.

13:15.767 --> 13:20.433
[Judy] COVID-19 didn't hit
this country until January of 2020.

13:20.500 --> 13:24.033
[Michael] I was going to attempt
to actually open it up, it never happened.

13:24.100 --> 13:26.867
Well, where were you gonna open it?

13:26.934 --> 13:30.300
On my father's property
where it was originally located.

13:30.367 --> 13:32.800
Okay. Now I got it.

13:32.867 --> 13:36.834
When you say you were going
to try to open it again, Mr. Ash,

13:36.900 --> 13:39.567
-the property still exists?
-Yes, ma'am.

13:39.633 --> 13:42.166
-This shop still exists?
-[Michael] Yes, ma'am.

13:42.233 --> 13:44.867
It's in my father's name.
It's his property.

13:44.934 --> 13:47.800
[Judy] I don't care
in whose name the property exists.

13:47.867 --> 13:49.934
Where are your siblings?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.900
My sibling, my sister lives in Texas.

13:52.967 --> 13:56.567
So, you're the only one
who lives in this area?

13:56.633 --> 13:57.667
Yes, ma'am.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.367
Got it.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.533
So, why did you have
to have a clean record for?

14:05.600 --> 14:06.767
So, I have good credit.

14:06.834 --> 14:09.100
For what, if she was purchasing a trailer?

14:09.166 --> 14:11.166
[Annalisa]
We were gonna purchase it together.

14:11.233 --> 14:12.500
[Judy] How are you going to
purchase it together?

14:12.567 --> 14:13.767
He had no money.

14:13.834 --> 14:15.967
[laughter]

14:26.033 --> 14:27.500
[narrator] <i>Annalisa Behsman</i>

14:27.567 --> 14:30.900
<i>has accused her ex-boyfriend Michael Ash</i>

14:30.967 --> 14:33.166
<i>of refusing to pay back loans.</i>

14:33.233 --> 14:36.633
<i>She is also suing</i>
<i>for the return of her belongings.</i>

14:36.700 --> 14:40.934
[Judy] Okay. The only other
thing that you have other than this 1,450.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.133
If you can find it...

14:43.200 --> 14:45.500
Yeah.
It's a little sketchy on the internet.

14:45.567 --> 14:47.800
[Chris] It'll come up on Google Maps.

14:47.867 --> 14:49.867
Uh-hmm. I have an address, but no owner.

14:49.934 --> 14:51.767
-No owner? But you have an address?
-[Sarah] Uh-hmm.

14:51.834 --> 14:54.767
What does it say, Sarah?
As far as what it does.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.900
Automotive and restorations.

14:57.967 --> 15:00.500
[Judy] But it does list it
as a current business?

15:00.567 --> 15:01.467
-That I can't tell.
-[Judy] It can't tell you?

15:01.533 --> 15:03.667
There--there hasn't been anything recent

15:03.734 --> 15:05.166
posted from what I can tell.

15:05.233 --> 15:07.633
The last post I see

15:07.700 --> 15:11.233
was October 20th of 2018.

15:11.300 --> 15:12.800
And what kind of post was that?

15:12.867 --> 15:14.367
On their Facebook page.

15:14.433 --> 15:15.800
[Chris]
There's a review on Google for them.

15:15.867 --> 15:17.300
[Judy] Oh, really?

15:17.367 --> 15:19.700
And there's a phone number listed as well.

15:19.767 --> 15:20.800
Really?

15:24.467 --> 15:26.166
Yes, ma'am. Would you stand up?

15:29.200 --> 15:33.800
Whether or not it's an official business,
Your Honor, is not the point.

15:33.867 --> 15:38.266
If--ooh, uh,
because it is a de facto business--

15:38.333 --> 15:39.266
Sit down.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.367
-[Chris] There's a review on...
-[Judy] Sit.

15:41.433 --> 15:43.233
Okay. Yes, ma'am.

15:44.266 --> 15:45.400
[Judy]
There's a current phone number?

15:45.467 --> 15:49.533
[Sarah] Listed on the Facebook page,
as well as I believe the Yelp page.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.834
-Really?
-Uh-hmm.

15:50.900 --> 15:51.734
Interesting.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.700
-Would you like it?
-No. I don't need it actually.

15:54.767 --> 15:57.033
Is this total public housing
where you're living?

15:57.100 --> 15:59.834
-Yes.
-So, the last time you had a job,

15:59.900 --> 16:02.500
according to you, was five years ago

16:02.567 --> 16:05.300
working as a driver,
you had too many accidents?

16:05.367 --> 16:07.100
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] But the last time,

16:07.166 --> 16:10.333
at least, there's a current
phone number for the...

16:10.400 --> 16:13.934
this mechanic's shop
that belongs to your father,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.867
who's allegedly not there, I assume.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.567
He lives on the property.

16:18.633 --> 16:20.567
Uh-hmm. But that's a current
phone number for the shop?

16:20.633 --> 16:22.200
-No, ma'am.
-No.

16:22.266 --> 16:23.767
That number is disconnected.

16:23.834 --> 16:24.967
As of when?

16:25.033 --> 16:25.967
A year and a half.

16:26.033 --> 16:27.200
[Judy]
What happened a year and a half ago?

16:28.200 --> 16:29.667
When that number went offline.

16:29.734 --> 16:31.200
What happened a year and a half ago?

16:31.266 --> 16:34.433
[Michael] That's when everything
was totally gave up on.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.633
[Judy] Uh-huh. What property of hers
do you still have at your house?

16:36.700 --> 16:38.834
[Michael] Her patio set,
which is on the outside.

16:38.900 --> 16:40.567
[Judy] Okay. You want that back?

16:40.633 --> 16:41.934
-[Annalisa] Yes, please.
-Okay.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.767
-You can go pick it up within five days.
-[Annalisa] Okay.

16:43.834 --> 16:44.767
What else?

16:44.834 --> 16:46.400
You mentioned the patio set.

16:46.467 --> 16:48.967
He mentioned the patio set.
What else is there?

16:49.033 --> 16:53.066
And there is a lot of DVDs that I own.

16:53.133 --> 16:54.233
I'm not getting--I'm...

16:54.300 --> 16:56.700
[Annalisa] There are four special books

16:56.767 --> 16:59.233
her fiance gave to me

16:59.300 --> 17:01.266
that were handwritten in,

17:01.333 --> 17:05.533
that he created, that Mr. Ash

17:05.600 --> 17:08.000
has because I was reading them
over at his house.

17:08.066 --> 17:09.900
-Also, too, they're...
-[Judy] Just a second.

17:09.967 --> 17:13.000
Mr. Ash, do you know
what four books she's talking about?

17:13.066 --> 17:14.233
Yes, ma'am.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.900
The four that she left behind

17:15.967 --> 17:18.767
because she had wanted nothing to do with

17:18.834 --> 17:20.567
Chris and her fiance.

17:20.633 --> 17:23.233
I-- okay. Do you know
which four books she's talking about?

17:23.300 --> 17:24.567
-Yes, ma'am.
-She's gonna pick those up

17:24.633 --> 17:26.400
with the patio set. What else?

17:26.467 --> 17:30.900
Also he has the original paperwork
on my second house.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.934
Where did you leave it?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.900
It was in his truck.

17:34.967 --> 17:36.467
Have you looked in your truck?

17:36.533 --> 17:37.900
-Yes, ma'am.
-Do you have the paperwork?

17:37.967 --> 17:39.233
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.533
So, she's gonna pick up the paperwork,

17:41.600 --> 17:45.700
the four books, and the patio furniture
within five days.

17:45.767 --> 17:48.533
You can take a marshal
if you believe you need it or sense...

17:48.600 --> 17:51.066
I will have to because
he called the police on me

17:51.133 --> 17:52.734
the last time when I was over there.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.600
Okay. So, we'll give you an order
and you can take it

17:55.667 --> 17:59.133
with a police officer for a standby
and pick up your property.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.433
-That sounds wonderful. Thank you.
-Yeah.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.700
Yeah. He's not giving you back the 250

18:03.767 --> 18:06.000
because I heard nothing about a loan.

18:06.066 --> 18:09.133
Now, we're gonna appear
about the 1,200 which came later.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.200
Let me hear about the 1,200

18:11.266 --> 18:14.667
which came after he didn't pay you
anything for the 250.

18:14.734 --> 18:18.433
The 1,200 was supposed to be a loan

18:18.500 --> 18:21.700
because we were moving
into a new place together,

18:21.767 --> 18:24.000
and with that fact being said

18:24.066 --> 18:27.200
I had paid off his bad debts
in order to...

18:27.266 --> 18:29.400
[Judy] Which bad--which bad debt?

18:29.467 --> 18:31.533
-I thought it was for her.
-[Annalisa] No. No.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.934
[Judy]
What, what did you pay off of his?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.734
I paid off two different things

18:36.800 --> 18:38.700
-and I do have the evidence here.
-[Judy] What?

18:38.767 --> 18:40.533
I'm looking them up, Your Honor.

18:40.600 --> 18:43.967
One is a check for IC Systems,

18:44.033 --> 18:47.200
I paid off $1,124.90.

18:47.266 --> 18:49.133
[Judy]
What is that? What is that, sir?

18:49.200 --> 18:52.333
-[Annalisa] It's an old debt that he has.
-Shh, shh, shh. What is that?

18:52.400 --> 18:56.100
[Michael] It's a collection company
that's being reported on my credit report.

18:56.166 --> 18:58.367
[Judy] So, it's probably
been there for a long time?

18:58.433 --> 18:59.367
Yes, ma'am.

18:59.433 --> 19:02.867
So, what's the reason
that you wanted that cleared?

19:02.934 --> 19:05.033
I did not want it cleared.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.934
She insisted that I have a clean record

19:07.000 --> 19:09.100
to be moving into this new house with her.

19:09.166 --> 19:10.433
-[Judy] To a new house?
-[Michael] Yes.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.834
[Judy]
Okay. Well, that's what I thought.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.633
I thought I read something
about a new place.

19:13.700 --> 19:16.033
What new place were you moving into?

19:16.100 --> 19:18.300
She was purchasing a trailer home

19:18.367 --> 19:20.233
in the far side of Duluth

19:20.300 --> 19:22.367
So, what did you have to have
a clean record for?

19:22.433 --> 19:24.066
So, I have good credit.

19:24.133 --> 19:26.266
For what? If she was purchasing a trailer?

19:26.333 --> 19:28.333
We were gonna purchase it together.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.900
[Judy] How were you
going to purchase it together?

19:29.967 --> 19:31.433
He had no money.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.066
Because we were planning
on getting married

19:33.133 --> 19:34.867
about a month after that.

19:34.934 --> 19:36.033
[Judy] It's still...
he still has no money.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.934
Now, he's married and unemployed.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.834
[Annalisa] And he also had to get
on the lot rent,

19:40.900 --> 19:44.367
so we needed to pay off his bad debt
for the lot rent...

19:44.433 --> 19:46.066
-[Judy] No.
-[Annalisa]...for him to live there.

19:46.133 --> 19:47.967
[Judy] No. I'm sorry. Sorry, madam.

19:48.033 --> 19:50.400
Sometimes, love makes people blind.

19:50.467 --> 19:53.233
You don't seem like
you're an unintelligent woman.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.734
You're gonna get back your furniture.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.467
You wanna pay off this loser's bad debt,
that's your problem.

19:58.533 --> 19:59.800
-[Annalisa] I understand, ma'am.
-[Judy] That's your problem.

19:59.867 --> 20:01.533
You had no expectation of being repaid.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.567
He didn't pay you back the 250

20:03.633 --> 20:05.667
and he's not paying you back the 1,200.

20:05.734 --> 20:08.734
And if somebody wants to look
into why he's not working at,

20:08.800 --> 20:12.000
at his father's mechanic shop,
they certainly should.

20:12.066 --> 20:15.033
So now, you're both living
in a $60 a month townhouse,

20:15.100 --> 20:16.166
the two of you together?

20:16.233 --> 20:17.233
-Good, good luck to you both.
-Ma'am.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.233
-[Deanna] No, we're not...
-[Judy] Good luck to you both.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.667
-[Kevin] Court is adjourned.
-[Judy] We are done.

20:22.834 --> 20:25.300
I thought it was a very fair decision.

20:25.367 --> 20:27.400
Mike Ash had given me the impression

20:27.467 --> 20:29.967
that he was working for many years.

20:30.033 --> 20:33.433
She's not happy that I got back together
with my first love of my life.

20:33.500 --> 20:36.033
I didn't know that he and Deanna Robinson

20:36.100 --> 20:37.533
were together for so long.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.867
She just wouldn't let go of me
and move on.

20:40.934 --> 20:42.767
Don't be so naive to other people.

20:42.834 --> 20:44.066
The heart wants what the heart wants.

20:44.133 --> 20:46.166
I'm willing to move on with my life.

20:46.233 --> 20:49.133
[Judy] <i>You know, I don't know</i>
<i>how many years I've been saying it.</i>

20:49.200 --> 20:52.033
If you're in love or think you're in love,

20:52.100 --> 20:53.900
and you give your partner money,

20:53.967 --> 20:56.000
it's a gift.

20:56.066 --> 20:57.800
If you wanna make it a loan

20:57.867 --> 21:01.934
to anybody, your brother, your sister,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.767
your child, your parent,

21:04.834 --> 21:08.967
certainly a transient boyfriend,
put it in writing.

21:09.033 --> 21:12.066
It may not be sexy, but neither is this.

21:12.133 --> 21:15.200
So, if you wanna be foolish enough
to give a boyfriend your money

21:15.266 --> 21:18.834
and you want it to be a loan
in case it falls apart get a note.

21:18.900 --> 21:19.967
Agreed.

21:21.633 --> 21:22.800
