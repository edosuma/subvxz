00:02.613 --> 00:04.272
You are being watched.

00:04.273 --> 00:06.112
The government has a secret system...

00:06.113 --> 00:07.982
secret system.

00:07.983 --> 00:11.772
A system you asked for to keep you safe.

00:11.773 --> 00:16.192
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:16.193 --> 00:18.812
You granted it the power
to see everything.

00:18.813 --> 00:23.812
To index, order, and control
the lives of ordinary people.

00:23.813 --> 00:27.112
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:27.113 --> 00:28.812
We don't.

00:28.813 --> 00:31.652
But to it you are all irrelevant,

00:31.653 --> 00:33.272
victim or perpetrator,

00:33.273 --> 00:35.112
if you stand in it's way...

00:35.113 --> 00:37.113
We'll find you.

01:46.153 --> 01:48.733
Hope you brought sunscreen.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.982
Sit your ass back down, Chiquita.

01:53.983 --> 01:56.982
You're gonna pay your fare another way.

02:16.733 --> 02:19.073
What are you gonna do? Kill us?

02:21.983 --> 02:24.612
Walk northeast about ten miles...

02:24.613 --> 02:26.982
you might live.

02:26.983 --> 02:29.812
And I think I'm gonna need this.

02:52.113 --> 02:54.443
Got eyes on our new number, Finch.

02:56.273 --> 02:58.402
He's like us,

02:58.403 --> 03:00.982
except he actually has a license
for breaking and entering.

03:00.983 --> 03:04.692
Indeed... Terry Easton.

03:04.693 --> 03:09.072
Thirty eight, lives with his wife Carla.

03:09.073 --> 03:11.772
He's had a number of odd jobs
but appears to have settled

03:11.773 --> 03:13.732
on that of a locksmith.

03:13.733 --> 03:18.072
24 hour service, case in point,
6:00 a.m. job.

03:18.073 --> 03:21.312
Apart from a few parking tickets,

03:21.313 --> 03:25.312
Mr. Easton appears
to be a model citizen.

03:25.313 --> 03:26.772
What are you doing, Finch?

03:26.773 --> 03:28.112
Doing a little cleaning, Mr. Reese.

03:28.113 --> 03:29.572
Just because it looks like a subway,

03:29.573 --> 03:31.022
doesn't mean it has to smell like one.

03:32.023 --> 03:33.942
No, Bear. Voruit.

03:33.943 --> 03:37.272
Good morning. You missed a spot.

03:37.273 --> 03:39.272
Ms. Groves, what can I help you with?

03:39.273 --> 03:43.072
Actually, I think
I'm here to help you, Harry.

03:43.073 --> 03:44.572
She gave me a number...

03:44.573 --> 03:48.272
a radio engineer, Matthew Stone.

03:48.273 --> 03:49.772
Guy's in charge of maintenance

03:49.773 --> 03:51.772
on the radio antennas
across the boroughs.

03:51.773 --> 03:55.072
He might be helping Samaritan
spread its coded messages.

03:55.073 --> 03:57.072
Or he may have stumbled
onto Samaritan's plot

03:57.073 --> 03:58.612
and become a liability.

03:58.613 --> 03:59.942
Either way, you should proceed

03:59.943 --> 04:01.572
with extreme caution, Ms. Groves.

04:01.573 --> 04:03.232
Don't worry, Harry.

04:03.233 --> 04:06.112
I'll keep my eye on Stone
from a distance,

04:06.113 --> 04:08.442
and I'm pretty sure...

04:08.443 --> 04:10.442
I'll have the biggest gun on the block.

04:13.443 --> 04:18.362
Finch, I don't think Easton's
6:00 a.m. job is on the clock.

04:20.613 --> 04:22.192
The guy's breaking in.

04:22.193 --> 04:25.232
Got any intel on this building, Finch?

04:25.233 --> 04:28.192
"Kepler & Mountain Investments,"

04:28.193 --> 04:30.612
private equity firm handling accounts

04:30.613 --> 04:32.442
in the hundreds of millions.

04:32.443 --> 04:34.522
The firm would most certainly
have its share

04:34.523 --> 04:36.232
of valuable information.

04:36.233 --> 04:38.442
I think he's here to steal it.

04:46.863 --> 04:48.232
Easton triggered the door alarm...

04:49.523 --> 04:50.772
And it didn't seem to stop him.

04:53.693 --> 04:55.573
That's not gonna happen, friend.

04:57.943 --> 05:00.272
Stay back... or else.

05:00.273 --> 05:01.772
Or else what?

05:01.773 --> 05:04.612
You set off that bomb, we all go.

05:04.613 --> 05:08.272
Between the flop sweat and shaky hands,

05:08.273 --> 05:10.524
you don't strike me as a killer.

05:11.363 --> 05:13.750
And I don't think you're suicidal.

05:16.193 --> 05:18.263
If you're not careful...

05:19.773 --> 05:23.052
we're all gonna have a really bad day.

05:27.313 --> 05:28.862
May I?

05:39.523 --> 05:40.876
Now...

05:41.363 --> 05:43.942
it's time that you and I
had a little chat.

05:55.273 --> 05:58.751
Bomb squad handles explosives
out of this precinct.

06:00.273 --> 06:01.812
If we find it's a terrorist act,

06:01.813 --> 06:04.199
we kick it to Homeland Security.

06:06.573 --> 06:09.232
That's felony weight. It's a long time.

06:09.233 --> 06:11.687
But you're no terrorist, are you Terry?

06:12.363 --> 06:14.312
You didn't make that bomb.

06:14.313 --> 06:16.230
So you want to tell me who did?

06:21.863 --> 06:23.744
Coffee's not bad.

06:25.313 --> 06:26.982
Not good, either.

06:26.983 --> 06:29.903
Well, it's a hell of a lot worse
in Supermax.

06:31.523 --> 06:34.070
Who sent you into that investment firm?

06:45.573 --> 06:48.152
You want to tell me
what's really going on?

06:52.813 --> 06:56.239
Easton seems terrified,
but he won't talk.

06:56.693 --> 06:59.442
He's either paid
to plant that bomb or coerced.

06:59.443 --> 07:02.272
His finances look rather ordinary.

07:02.273 --> 07:04.612
I don't see anything that
suggests he's been paid off,

07:04.613 --> 07:07.272
and he's certainly not a client
of such a high-end firm.

07:07.273 --> 07:10.272
He doesn't seem like a pro,
so why use him to begin with?

07:10.273 --> 07:11.942
Perhaps that's why, Mr. Reese.

07:11.943 --> 07:14.072
Because our locksmith appears so benign,

07:14.073 --> 07:15.772
you'd never see him coming.

07:15.773 --> 07:17.572
Well, I confiscated his cell.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.073
See what you can find.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.176
So, where's the new partner?

07:29.983 --> 07:32.232
His transfer's still pending.

07:32.233 --> 07:34.231
I'm flying solo until then.

07:34.813 --> 07:36.232
Just like this guy.

07:36.233 --> 07:37.527
Incoming.

07:38.153 --> 07:41.335
One of New York's Finest
taking on a gang of Templarios.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.072
Hey, Chen, let me give you a hand.

07:43.615 --> 07:44.652
Mr. Reese?

07:44.653 --> 07:47.612
I've discovered an alarming
self-deleting text

07:47.613 --> 07:50.560
on Mr. Easton's phone,
and I've restored it.

07:51.483 --> 07:53.473
It's Mr. Easton's wife.

07:55.233 --> 07:58.942
I know this is your wife Carla,
and I know you're scared.

07:58.943 --> 08:02.811
What I don't know
is who sent this message.

08:03.523 --> 08:06.903
Whoever it is knew you could
access that investment firm.

08:08.233 --> 08:10.153
He said not to talk to anyone.

08:14.023 --> 08:17.230
- He said he'd kill her.
- He?

08:17.653 --> 08:20.362
Terry, I can't save Carla
unless you talk to me.

08:20.363 --> 08:22.232
Tell me who he is.

08:22.233 --> 08:24.902
I can't tell you because I don't know.

08:28.273 --> 08:30.806
I got a call from someone.

08:31.613 --> 08:33.506
It was just a voice,

08:34.073 --> 08:36.062
but he knew everything about me.

08:36.573 --> 08:38.383
He said he'd kill Carla.

08:38.943 --> 08:40.871
He sent that text.

08:41.153 --> 08:43.402
An hour later, a package was delivered

08:43.403 --> 08:44.982
to my door.

08:44.983 --> 08:48.710
A bomb with instructions.

08:52.153 --> 08:54.095
And I failed.

08:58.193 --> 09:00.022
It's him.

09:04.693 --> 09:06.104
Answer it.

09:10.273 --> 09:11.629
Hello?

09:11.943 --> 09:14.634
Mr. Easton, you failed your assignment.

09:14.863 --> 09:16.942
And while I appreciate the effort,

09:16.943 --> 09:18.692
I'm sorry to inform you

09:18.693 --> 09:20.442
that you're never going to see
your wife again.

09:20.443 --> 09:22.362
I hope you understand.

09:22.363 --> 09:24.974
Cleanliness is all.

09:25.403 --> 09:26.814
Mr. Reese...

09:27.773 --> 09:30.233
I'm afraid I recognize that voice.

09:37.851 --> 09:40.585
Finally, a chance to speak
to the man who handed me

09:40.672 --> 09:41.758
my first defeat.

09:41.759 --> 09:44.971
I hope you understand.
Cleanliness is all.

09:48.593 --> 09:50.598
Voice analysis was a match.

09:51.343 --> 09:53.132
The last time we encountered The Voice,

09:53.133 --> 09:55.512
he had coerced a 911 call operator

09:55.513 --> 09:57.092
into covering up a murder.

09:57.093 --> 10:00.012
That call center operator
had access to a server.

10:00.013 --> 10:02.842
Just like Easton could access
the investment firm.

10:02.843 --> 10:05.302
And in both cases,
The Voice had leverage.

10:05.303 --> 10:08.302
Need I remind you that a child
almost died at his hands.

10:08.303 --> 10:11.525
We need to find Easton's wife
before it's too late.

10:12.343 --> 10:14.672
When was the last time
you heard from Carla?

10:14.673 --> 10:17.262
She never came home
from work last night.

10:17.514 --> 10:18.802
And then the call came.

10:18.803 --> 10:22.302
Mr. Reese? I've managed
to extract location data

10:22.303 --> 10:24.262
from the digital photo of Carla.

10:24.263 --> 10:25.592
She's being held in a warehouse

10:25.593 --> 10:27.342
in the meat-packing district.

10:27.343 --> 10:29.645
I'm sending you the address now.

10:30.923 --> 10:32.324
Is that about Carla?

10:32.673 --> 10:34.592
You know... you know where she is?

10:34.593 --> 10:36.468
Don't worry, we'll find her.

10:36.973 --> 10:38.589
Can I come with you?

10:38.923 --> 10:41.302
- Please.
- Stay put.

10:41.303 --> 10:44.092
I will bring her back to you safely.

10:44.093 --> 10:45.613
I promise.

10:48.593 --> 10:51.172
Need you to find
our invisible man, Finch.

10:51.173 --> 10:53.512
I may have an idea
about how to locate The Voice.

10:53.513 --> 10:56.803
Use one enigmatic criminal
to catch another.

10:58.263 --> 11:01.512
Hey, got a location
on a possible hostage.

11:01.513 --> 11:02.842
Could use a little back up.

11:02.843 --> 11:05.380
- I'll have a team ready in two minutes.
- Thanks.

11:05.673 --> 11:09.172
Detective Fusco, thanks for your help
with those Templarios.

11:09.173 --> 11:11.712
They're playing hopscotch
over in holding.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.408
Thought I'd return the favor.

11:14.053 --> 11:16.342
- Case for you.
- My hero.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.172
Amir Siddiq, delivery cab driver.

11:19.173 --> 11:20.342
He got popped the other day
on possession

11:20.343 --> 11:22.265
of an unregistered weapon.

11:22.553 --> 11:24.382
Since when does homicide
handle unregistered weapons?

11:24.383 --> 11:26.052
Since four hours ago.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.922
Ballistics matched the gun
to a two-year-old murder.

11:28.289 --> 11:30.553
All right, great.
I'll add him to the pile.

11:32.213 --> 11:34.224
Hey, Lionel, I need your help.

11:36.449 --> 11:37.841
Keep your secrets.

11:37.843 --> 11:39.172
Don't expect me to be your back up.

11:39.173 --> 11:40.922
I don't need back up.

11:41.225 --> 11:43.012
I need you to keep an eye on Easton.

11:43.338 --> 11:45.382
I'm not your partner anymore,
so get used to it.

11:45.633 --> 11:47.551
Besides, you got cops all around here.

11:47.553 --> 11:49.172
Put a uniform on it.

11:49.457 --> 11:51.843
Detective Riley, ready to go, sir.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.033
If you don't mind,
I got my own case to deal with.

12:09.636 --> 12:10.686
Have a seat, Amir.

12:13.976 --> 12:15.765
I don't understand, Detective.

12:15.766 --> 12:18.055
I was told I'd be released,
but then they moved me.

12:18.056 --> 12:20.555
I'm sorry, I-I should have
registered the gun.

12:20.556 --> 12:22.194
I'm sorry, too,

12:23.426 --> 12:26.426
'cause your gun has a body on it.

12:27.476 --> 12:28.657
What?

12:29.426 --> 12:32.475
I-I don't know anything about that.

12:32.476 --> 12:34.265
Look, getting the gun was a bad idea,

12:34.266 --> 12:35.765
but I've been robbed before.

12:35.766 --> 12:37.055
Amir, if you want to get out out here,

12:37.056 --> 12:38.515
you got to tell me
where you got that gun.

12:38.516 --> 12:40.885
Yes, yes, of course. Whatever you need.

12:40.886 --> 12:43.345
I got it from a gun show
in Cleveland six months ago.

12:43.346 --> 12:44.725
You got any proof of that?

12:44.726 --> 12:47.135
I paid in cash. I-I got a receipt,

12:47.136 --> 12:49.040
but I threw it away.

12:50.556 --> 12:52.121
I'm sorry.

12:53.516 --> 12:55.425
All right, hang on, we'll check it out.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.359
Thank you.

13:03.526 --> 13:06.237
So you want to know about The Voice?

13:08.186 --> 13:10.864
I suppose I am in your debt.

13:12.556 --> 13:15.360
You and John are the reason
I'm still alive.

13:15.726 --> 13:17.725
I've had a few run-ins
with his operations

13:17.726 --> 13:20.600
over the years. The man's a ghost.

13:21.386 --> 13:23.809
Even ghosts have a trail.

13:24.686 --> 13:26.885
I may know of someone
who's been contracted

13:26.886 --> 13:28.225
by The Voice in the past,

13:28.226 --> 13:30.555
but it'll come at a price.

13:30.556 --> 13:32.725
I'm afraid we're not
in a position to pay you.

13:32.726 --> 13:34.049
I don't want money.

13:36.726 --> 13:38.294
I want to go with you.

13:41.226 --> 13:43.185
The man you're seeking associates

13:43.186 --> 13:45.055
with known criminals and killers.

13:45.056 --> 13:46.925
Trust me, you could use
a hand on this one.

13:46.926 --> 13:49.425
The moment you surface outside,
you are a marked man.

13:49.426 --> 13:51.843
And I've already lost my two friends.

13:52.426 --> 13:54.502
I can not afford to lose another.

14:01.806 --> 14:04.725
Thanks. This photo was texted
from this warehouse.

14:04.726 --> 14:06.055
The man who took her may be armed

14:06.056 --> 14:07.725
and is extremely dangerous.

14:07.726 --> 14:09.476
We'll take it from here, sir.

14:11.096 --> 14:14.026
Mr. Reese, have you located
Easton's wife?

14:14.386 --> 14:16.203
We're about to move in.

14:16.476 --> 14:18.225
If she's in there, we'll get her back.

14:19.266 --> 14:20.926
Let's move!

14:27.056 --> 14:28.685
Hello?

14:28.686 --> 14:31.015
So nice to finally meet you,
Detective Riley.

14:31.016 --> 14:33.015
I believe you were the one
who saved little Aaron

14:33.016 --> 14:35.425
from the bomb strapped to his back.

14:35.426 --> 14:38.225
Of course, you won't be
so lucky with Carla.

14:40.016 --> 14:42.515
I see this time you've brought the NYPD.

14:42.516 --> 14:45.475
That's okay, plenty of
bombs to go around.

14:47.556 --> 14:49.886
Everyone out now. It's a trap.

15:09.326 --> 15:10.655
That's okay.

15:10.656 --> 15:11.995
Plenty of bombs to go around.

15:11.996 --> 15:13.785
911.

15:13.786 --> 15:15.235
Looks like a bomb outside my front door!

15:15.237 --> 15:16.656
And he told me there's a bomb!

15:16.657 --> 15:18.616
911.

15:18.617 --> 15:20.076
Someone just called in
threatening to blow up...

15:20.077 --> 15:21.496
There's a bomb in the building!

15:21.497 --> 15:23.076
It looked like a pipe bomb!

15:24.997 --> 15:27.326
We got two officers down,
one in critical condition.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.116
Now we got at least ten calls of reports

15:29.117 --> 15:30.326
of bomb threats in the area.

15:30.327 --> 15:32.452
Bomb squad's stretched thin.

15:33.327 --> 15:34.830
And her?

15:35.497 --> 15:36.826
Your victim wasn't in the wreckage.

15:36.827 --> 15:38.231
Thanks.

15:38.617 --> 15:41.496
Finch, seems Easton's wife
may still be alive.

15:41.497 --> 15:43.156
If that's true, then The Voice has made

15:43.157 --> 15:46.286
a deliberate decision
to maintain leverage on Easton,

15:46.287 --> 15:47.616
but to what purpose?

15:47.617 --> 15:49.496
I'm heading back to the 8th to find out.

15:49.497 --> 15:50.656
Where are you?

15:50.657 --> 15:52.996
I'm tracking one of The Voice's
known associates.

15:52.997 --> 15:54.826
Well, you be careful.

15:54.827 --> 15:56.616
These are dangerous people.

15:56.617 --> 15:59.077
Clearly. I brought back up.

16:00.657 --> 16:02.406
We're breaking into a school?

16:02.407 --> 16:04.576
Don't worry, Professor,
you'll fit right in.

16:16.077 --> 16:18.277
I think I found my mark.

16:18.827 --> 16:21.036
Matthew Stone.

16:21.497 --> 16:25.211
What kind of radio engineer
works in the dead of night?

16:25.577 --> 16:27.156
Mm-hmm.

16:27.157 --> 16:29.696
The kind that works
with Samaritan agents.

16:29.697 --> 16:32.996
Which means our rival A.I.
is indeed trying

16:32.997 --> 16:34.996
to expand its bandwidth.

16:34.997 --> 16:38.406
I guess my mission wasn't
to save this number after all.

16:40.197 --> 16:41.366
What?

16:41.367 --> 16:43.236
Where'd that shot come from?

16:43.237 --> 16:44.577
Oh.

16:47.077 --> 16:49.469
Well, things just got interesting.

16:56.157 --> 16:57.496
We ran the ballistics on your gun

16:57.497 --> 16:59.247
in the federal database.

16:59.657 --> 17:00.826
And guess what?

17:00.827 --> 17:03.326
It was a match to four other murders

17:03.327 --> 17:05.085
in four different states.

17:05.497 --> 17:07.536
What? That's not possible.

17:07.537 --> 17:10.616
I-I... that must have been
the gun's previous owner.

17:10.617 --> 17:12.366
I have never used the gun.

17:12.367 --> 17:13.866
That's strange because they all happened

17:13.867 --> 17:15.826
in the last six months
when you owned it.

17:15.827 --> 17:18.826
In fact, one of them was
the same night as the gun show.

17:18.827 --> 17:20.195
And your prints were a partial match

17:20.196 --> 17:22.366
to the ones taken at the crime scene.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.576
But here's the kicker.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.195
I got a witness composite
that said that the shooter

17:27.196 --> 17:29.576
fled in a town car.

17:29.577 --> 17:31.907
There's a hell of a resemblance,
don't you think?

17:35.577 --> 17:38.826
You're not just some harmless driver.

17:38.827 --> 17:40.717
I got you, Amir.

17:52.037 --> 17:54.325
You're not as slow as you look.

17:55.737 --> 17:59.696
We're done here... till can get the D.A.

17:59.697 --> 18:01.605
D.A. my ass.

18:01.997 --> 18:04.446
There's gonna be no deal for you, pal.

18:04.447 --> 18:06.536
I'm gonna lock you up
downstairs till I get a warrant

18:06.537 --> 18:08.485
to check your car for fibers,

18:09.287 --> 18:10.826
and after that,

18:10.827 --> 18:13.429
I'm gonna reserve your room at Riker's.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.973
And here I thought your
teaching days were long gone.

18:37.287 --> 18:39.496
Oh, this hasn't been
a school in two years.

18:39.497 --> 18:41.205
Budget cuts.

18:41.947 --> 18:44.696
But this place is all but deserted.

18:44.697 --> 18:46.885
All but...

18:47.787 --> 18:49.826
All but for the man
who supplies The Voice

18:49.827 --> 18:51.116
with his ammunition,

18:51.117 --> 18:52.829
and the rats, of course.

18:53.327 --> 18:55.326
For a school no longer in session,

18:55.327 --> 18:58.156
it certainly has high security.

18:58.157 --> 19:01.116
The man on the other side
of this door is careful,

19:01.117 --> 19:03.829
cunning, dangerous.

19:03.997 --> 19:06.798
- So who is he?
- The custodian.

19:07.657 --> 19:09.826
School's closed. No trespassing.

19:09.827 --> 19:11.286
Open up, Raul.

19:11.287 --> 19:13.366
I never properly thanked you
for providing

19:13.367 --> 19:15.917
the car bomb that killed my father.

19:26.447 --> 19:29.428
- Hello, Raul.
- Elias.

19:29.947 --> 19:31.616
I thought you were dead.

19:31.617 --> 19:33.156
I thought about keeping it that way,

19:33.157 --> 19:35.669
- but where's the fun in that?
- Hmm.

19:36.407 --> 19:38.510
The Voice employs the use of bombs.

19:38.867 --> 19:40.906
To use bombs, you need a bomb maker,

19:40.907 --> 19:42.866
and Raul here is the best of the best.

19:42.867 --> 19:44.406
Isn't he?

19:44.407 --> 19:47.076
I'm sorry, I can not give you
any information.

19:47.077 --> 19:49.656
And whatever you're gonna try
to do to me to get me to talk,

19:49.657 --> 19:51.076
he'll do worse.

19:53.997 --> 19:55.996
Oh, come on, Raul.

19:58.237 --> 20:00.156
He can't do worse to you
if you're already dead.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.076
Elias...

20:02.077 --> 20:04.286
We are surrounded by explosives.

20:04.287 --> 20:05.906
Good thing these hollow point bullets

20:05.907 --> 20:08.656
won't hit anything
except your internal organs.

20:08.657 --> 20:10.366
Messy, but just for you.

20:13.197 --> 20:15.496
How many explosives
did you build for The Voice

20:15.497 --> 20:17.438
and where are they located?

20:24.617 --> 20:26.286
All hands on deck
to help the bomb squad.

20:26.287 --> 20:27.446
Captain's orders.

20:27.447 --> 20:28.826
Then why are you still here?

20:28.827 --> 20:30.866
Just busted open
a multiple homicide case.

20:30.867 --> 20:33.496
Suspect's in lock up downstairs.

20:33.497 --> 20:35.496
This guy look like
a serial killer to you?

20:35.497 --> 20:38.165
Number of bodies
coming back on him chilling.

20:49.447 --> 20:51.446
Hey, I had a witness in here.
Terry Easton.

20:51.447 --> 20:53.461
- Have you seen him?
- Uh-uh.

20:59.787 --> 21:03.076
Come here. Where exactly
do you think you're going?

21:03.077 --> 21:04.906
An officer told me that I had to leave

21:04.907 --> 21:06.671
the interrogation room.

21:07.407 --> 21:09.326
Did you find my wife?

21:09.327 --> 21:11.326
He's still got her.

21:11.327 --> 21:13.826
That means he's still got you
under his thumb.

21:13.827 --> 21:16.497
What's he making you do?

21:21.077 --> 21:24.656
They were slipped under the door.

21:24.657 --> 21:26.406
- By whom?
- I don't know.

21:26.407 --> 21:29.236
But I got a text with instructions.

21:29.237 --> 21:30.996
To do what?

21:30.997 --> 21:34.576
To open the holding cell
where the gang members are

21:34.577 --> 21:37.525
or my wife wasn't gonna
escape the next bomb.

21:37.947 --> 21:40.156
Templarios. Sit down.

21:40.157 --> 21:42.446
Finch, Easton was supposed to
get arrested.

21:42.447 --> 21:44.656
All to get access to the holding cell

21:44.657 --> 21:46.906
- in this precinct.
- But why?

21:46.907 --> 21:48.156
The Voice is using Easton
to try to break out

21:48.157 --> 21:49.736
the Templarios.

21:49.737 --> 21:53.076
Who better to orchestrate
a jailbreak than a locksmith?

21:53.077 --> 21:54.656
But how does The Voice communicate

21:54.657 --> 21:56.576
with Mr. Easton inside the precinct?

21:56.577 --> 21:58.736
Someone slipped him a phone.

21:58.737 --> 22:00.496
Then our number isn't the only one

22:00.497 --> 22:01.696
doing The Voice's biddings.

22:01.697 --> 22:03.326
Someone else is working for him.

22:03.327 --> 22:05.576
Which means the Templarios

22:05.577 --> 22:07.496
might have an early release after all.

22:07.497 --> 22:10.736
Come here. We better go check holding.

22:13.577 --> 22:15.119
We're too late.

22:17.697 --> 22:19.400
The cells are empty,

22:20.407 --> 22:21.826
and now the Templarios are loose.

22:21.827 --> 22:25.161
Wait, look, those guys
are locking themselves in.

22:25.657 --> 22:28.496
Finch, I don't think
this is a jailbreak.

22:28.497 --> 22:30.156
Mr. Reese, the bombs,

22:30.157 --> 22:32.406
they're specifically located
within the jurisdiction

22:32.407 --> 22:34.656
of the 8th precinct
to draw out all the cops.

22:34.657 --> 22:36.236
How'd you get that information?

22:36.237 --> 22:39.832
Elias can be quite persuasive.

22:40.237 --> 22:42.536
The Voice meant
to empty out the precinct

22:42.537 --> 22:44.536
so the Templarios
can get to something...

22:45.697 --> 22:47.236
or someone inside.

22:52.657 --> 22:55.366
Stay close, whatever
the Templarios have planned,

22:55.367 --> 22:57.247
it's begun.

23:01.037 --> 23:02.996
Found our Samaritan op.

23:02.997 --> 23:05.116
Looks like he wants to play
hide and seek in the park.

23:17.737 --> 23:20.185
Come out, come out wherever you are.

23:22.157 --> 23:23.366
What?

23:26.947 --> 23:29.737
- Root?
- Shaw.

23:46.383 --> 23:50.214
Sameen...

23:51.022 --> 23:52.851
You're really here.

23:57.319 --> 23:58.770
She brought you back to me.

24:02.943 --> 24:04.857
Wha... what are you doing here?

24:04.858 --> 24:06.517
What does it look like?

24:06.518 --> 24:08.991
I'm taking on Samaritan
one agent at a time.

24:14.558 --> 24:17.357
- I gotta go.
- Wait.

24:17.358 --> 24:19.557
Go where? Wait.

24:19.558 --> 24:23.107
- When did you escape?
- It's complicated, Root.

24:23.108 --> 24:25.307
Then explain it to me.

24:26.398 --> 24:28.325
Please.

24:29.608 --> 24:31.701
I escaped a week ago.

24:33.518 --> 24:36.008
I couldn't come and find you
because it wasn't safe.

24:37.018 --> 24:38.418
Why?

24:39.558 --> 24:42.107
When they had me,
they put me through these tests,

24:42.108 --> 24:45.437
these... simulations.

24:45.438 --> 24:47.274
Simulation?

24:47.688 --> 24:49.748
Over 7,000 of them,

24:50.188 --> 24:52.525
and always with the same goal.

24:53.398 --> 24:55.277
To turn me against all of you.

24:58.438 --> 25:00.020
To kill you.

25:02.188 --> 25:05.244
- Well, obviously they failed.
- No.

25:06.558 --> 25:08.167
They didn't,

25:08.858 --> 25:15.357
because in all the simulations,
that's exactly what I did.

25:24.398 --> 25:25.909
Stay close.

25:26.148 --> 25:27.897
If the Templarios are crazy enough

25:27.898 --> 25:29.612
to take over a police precinct,

25:29.898 --> 25:31.227
they won't hesitate to kill anyone

25:31.228 --> 25:32.433
who gets in their way.

25:32.728 --> 25:34.317
Considering the situation,
perhaps you should

25:34.318 --> 25:35.383
call for back up.

25:35.818 --> 25:38.017
It had to be a cop
who let the Templarios out

25:38.018 --> 25:39.897
in the first place.

25:39.898 --> 25:43.478
I'm not involving any more
until we know who we can trust.

25:43.858 --> 25:46.187
Given the number of convicts
you're up against,

25:46.188 --> 25:48.397
I urge you to reconsider.

25:48.398 --> 25:50.557
The NYPD's overwhelmed
with bomb threats.

25:50.558 --> 25:52.817
Templarios have booby trapped
the precinct doors.

25:52.818 --> 25:55.517
I won't risk losing any more cops today.

25:55.518 --> 25:57.267
Then what is your plan?

25:57.268 --> 25:58.727
Keep Easton safe and find out

25:58.728 --> 26:00.397
what the hell the Templarios want.

26:00.398 --> 26:02.557
I may be able to help you with that.

26:02.558 --> 26:05.017
I traced the warehouse bomb's
detonation signal

26:05.018 --> 26:07.017
to an apartment building in Soho.

26:07.018 --> 26:08.521
We're headed there now.

26:08.898 --> 26:12.317
Could belong to The Voice.
Be careful, Finch.

26:12.318 --> 26:14.057
You do the same, John.

26:18.228 --> 26:19.357
Whoa!

26:21.818 --> 26:24.227
I thought I was the only cop
left in the building.

26:24.228 --> 26:26.227
You and I need to stick together.

26:26.228 --> 26:27.727
What the hell's going on around here?

26:27.728 --> 26:29.261
Let's find out.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.977
Look like the Templarios
hit the jackpot.

26:40.978 --> 26:43.147
They'll all be armed.

26:43.148 --> 26:45.897
Yeah, they'll be wearing
SWAT vests like this jackass.

26:48.648 --> 26:50.525
Let's see how that works.

27:02.898 --> 27:04.693
Hurts even with the vest, don't it?

27:05.148 --> 27:07.249
What are your boys after
in the precinct?

27:07.898 --> 27:09.147
I'm not telling you nothing.

27:09.148 --> 27:11.029
That right, tough guy?

27:11.608 --> 27:12.977
You like coming after cops?

27:12.978 --> 27:15.477
Here's a little something for the ones
you blew up earlier.

27:15.478 --> 27:16.937
Lionel.

27:16.938 --> 27:18.765
I don't know nothing
about blowing up no cops.

27:19.228 --> 27:21.107
Just got told to take out
some dude named Amir.

27:21.108 --> 27:23.553
Amir? Amir Siddiq?

27:25.058 --> 27:26.477
That's the multiple homicide suspect

27:26.478 --> 27:27.977
I got locked up in solitary.

27:27.978 --> 27:29.977
- Who wants him dead?
- Don't know.

27:29.978 --> 27:31.557
I just got paid to do the job.

27:31.558 --> 27:33.727
No questions. No witnesses.

27:33.728 --> 27:36.897
Maybe Amir can implicate
someone else in his murders.

27:36.898 --> 27:38.147
What, like a partner?

27:38.148 --> 27:40.557
Somebody hired The Voice
to take him out.

27:40.558 --> 27:43.317
- The Voice?
- I'll explain on the way,

27:43.318 --> 27:45.267
but we need to get to Amir
before the Templarios do.

27:45.268 --> 27:46.727
I got him down in the basement.

27:46.728 --> 27:49.221
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

27:50.558 --> 27:52.397
- You feel better?
- Mucho.

27:55.058 --> 27:56.397
You stay here.

27:56.398 --> 27:57.767
Keep your head down, door locked.

27:57.768 --> 27:59.227
I'll be back once we find Amir.

27:59.228 --> 28:00.396
You gotta be kidding me.

28:00.728 --> 28:02.345
What about my wife?

28:02.898 --> 28:04.647
Don't worry, we'll find her

28:04.648 --> 28:06.621
along with the guy who took her.

28:06.938 --> 28:08.667
Here you go, slugger. Good luck.

28:15.768 --> 28:17.938
Freeze, Harold.

28:20.358 --> 28:22.767
Tripwire. Place like this
is likely full of them.

28:22.768 --> 28:24.767
Good to know.

28:32.398 --> 28:34.937
Such precautions would suggest
that we have found

28:34.938 --> 28:37.275
The Voice's base of operation.

28:38.898 --> 28:41.397
Then there may still lie dangers ahead.

28:41.398 --> 28:43.482
Which reminds me, thank you...

28:43.898 --> 28:45.557
for your assistance today.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.107
Not at all, Harold.

28:47.108 --> 28:49.235
I'm the one who owes you and John...

28:49.768 --> 28:51.900
a debt I fully intend to repay.

28:52.358 --> 28:55.687
I should have known.

28:55.688 --> 28:57.647
The bomb's detonation signal
came from here,

28:57.648 --> 28:58.937
but it was a relay.

28:58.938 --> 29:01.131
It originated at another location.

29:01.358 --> 29:03.687
- You know where?
- Take time to find out.

29:03.688 --> 29:06.669
Something I fear Mr. Reese
is in short supply of.

29:07.688 --> 29:09.899
Well, what do we have here?

29:10.728 --> 29:12.133
Oh, Harold?

29:20.058 --> 29:22.227
Open up, Amir.

29:24.058 --> 29:26.058
That's Amir's cell.

29:28.018 --> 29:30.557
Come on, it's okay. It's just Chen.

29:37.898 --> 29:39.108
Wait.

29:43.858 --> 29:45.558
This the guy?

29:47.268 --> 29:50.397
Someone's gone through a lot of
trouble to kill you. Why?

29:50.398 --> 29:52.227
Does it have to do with
those people you murdered?

29:52.228 --> 29:54.727
Not murders, Detective, hits...

29:54.728 --> 29:56.267
for my former employer.

29:56.268 --> 29:58.937
- Your employer?
- The Voice?

30:02.358 --> 30:04.857
My targets were all people
who previously worked for him.

30:04.858 --> 30:06.607
He likes to tie up loose ends.

30:06.608 --> 30:08.727
Which I realized I was gonna be too.

30:08.728 --> 30:12.357
So I did some digging.
How he hires everyone.

30:12.358 --> 30:15.187
Three different shell companies,
same P.O. Box,

30:15.188 --> 30:17.057
but I followed the courier...

30:17.058 --> 30:19.187
who took me to my true employer.

30:19.188 --> 30:21.465
You know his identity?

30:22.188 --> 30:24.170
Figured I might need it someday...

30:24.688 --> 30:26.290
and here we are.

30:26.768 --> 30:28.937
And he knew you'd flip on him
as soon as you got arrested.

30:28.938 --> 30:31.767
So then, he uses the Templarios

30:31.768 --> 30:33.515
to get to you in the precinct.

30:33.898 --> 30:35.727
You get me out of here
with a deal in writing,

30:35.728 --> 30:37.517
and I'll tell you who he is.

30:41.688 --> 30:43.227
Take him up to the bullpen.

30:43.228 --> 30:44.897
Bomb squad should have
things in hand by now,

30:44.898 --> 30:46.267
so go ahead and call for back up.

30:46.268 --> 30:48.357
I'll go get Easton, meet you up there.

30:48.358 --> 30:49.619
Let's move.

30:54.188 --> 30:55.499
Stop.

30:57.518 --> 30:59.267
All clear, move.

31:08.108 --> 31:09.507
Sit down.

31:20.978 --> 31:22.687
This guy's a stone killer.

31:22.688 --> 31:23.977
No one opens this door, got it?

31:23.978 --> 31:25.024
Mm-hmm.

31:30.858 --> 31:32.607
This is Detective Lionel Fusco calling

31:32.608 --> 31:35.357
from inside the 8th precinct.
We need immediate back up.

31:35.358 --> 31:37.927
We've got multiple combatants
in the building.

31:41.818 --> 31:43.267
What the hell are you doing?

31:43.268 --> 31:44.767
The Voice had someone other than Easton

31:44.768 --> 31:46.477
release the Templarios.

31:46.478 --> 31:49.817
Someone on the inside.
Isn't that right, Chen?

31:49.818 --> 31:53.687
I didn't have a choice.

31:53.688 --> 31:55.551
He threatened my family.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.517
The Templarios. They're coming.

31:58.518 --> 32:00.318
Get down.

32:02.898 --> 32:05.147
- How many guys they got?
- More than we've got bullets.

32:05.148 --> 32:06.357
Take cover.

32:12.858 --> 32:15.227
Should have put in for a transfer.

32:15.228 --> 32:16.897
Sorry, partner.

32:16.898 --> 32:18.728
This is a hell of a way to go out.

32:22.188 --> 32:25.727
On me. One, two...

32:25.728 --> 32:27.727
three.

32:49.391 --> 32:52.640
Sameen, please, you have to believe me.

32:52.641 --> 32:55.470
This isn't a simulation. This is real.

32:55.471 --> 32:58.800
You're safe now.
Let's get back to the subway.

32:58.801 --> 33:00.049
No.

33:02.561 --> 33:04.145
We can't.

33:06.681 --> 33:08.390
- Shaw...
- The simplest way

33:08.391 --> 33:11.470
to break someone is to
rob them of their reality,

33:11.471 --> 33:13.010
and they did that well.

33:13.011 --> 33:18.121
And maybe you're right,
maybe I am safe...

33:20.141 --> 33:22.471
but as long as I'm alive...

33:24.471 --> 33:26.728
You'll never be safe.

33:27.061 --> 33:28.720
What do you mean?

33:28.721 --> 33:31.640
I could turn on you at any moment,

33:31.641 --> 33:34.220
and even if I don't, I could
lead them to the Machine.

33:34.221 --> 33:35.970
That'll never happen.

33:35.971 --> 33:38.471
I don't know if
I'm calling the shots anymore...

33:39.721 --> 33:41.832
And neither do you.

33:42.391 --> 33:45.157
7,000 simulations.

33:45.721 --> 33:48.390
I killed a lot of people,

33:48.391 --> 33:51.011
but the one person
that I couldn't kill...

33:52.851 --> 33:54.346
Was you.

33:56.851 --> 33:58.935
So I killed myself.

33:59.511 --> 34:02.891
Over and over again.

34:08.261 --> 34:10.760
And I'd rather do that here and now

34:10.761 --> 34:12.850
than to risk your life.

34:12.851 --> 34:14.918
Okay, Shaw.

34:16.301 --> 34:18.429
What the hell are you doing?

34:18.431 --> 34:20.350
We'll play it your way here.

34:20.351 --> 34:22.891
You can't live with me...

34:25.141 --> 34:27.891
I can't live without you.

34:29.011 --> 34:31.850
So if you die, I die too.

34:31.851 --> 34:33.761
Put that down.

34:35.181 --> 34:36.850
I really don't know what's gonna happen

34:36.851 --> 34:39.025
when we pull the trigger.

34:40.471 --> 34:43.601
Never been much
of a believer, but hey...

34:46.221 --> 34:48.000
You never know.

34:52.851 --> 34:55.219
Guess we're about
to find out, aren't we?

34:55.221 --> 34:56.967
Damn it, Root.

35:08.971 --> 35:10.970
Easton, stay down.

35:16.971 --> 35:18.430
I'm out.

35:22.301 --> 35:23.649
Thanks.

35:25.851 --> 35:27.850
All this time,
you were looking for The Voice,

35:27.851 --> 35:29.930
and he was trying to track you, Harold.

35:29.931 --> 35:31.470
Thought we had him in our sights once.

35:31.471 --> 35:33.470
I threatened to electrocute him

35:33.471 --> 35:36.260
till I realized it was just a hired gun.

35:36.261 --> 35:38.432
More smoke and mirrors.

35:39.011 --> 35:40.640
And what will you do if you find

35:40.641 --> 35:42.300
the real man behind the curtain?

35:42.301 --> 35:45.233
- Oh, that's odd.
- What?

35:45.258 --> 35:48.350
A large transaction
initiated from this node.

35:48.351 --> 35:52.140
Payment deposited
into the account of an actress

35:52.141 --> 35:54.680
who looks an awful lot like Mrs. Easton.

35:54.681 --> 35:56.600
Her abduction is a total fabrication.

35:56.601 --> 35:59.291
- A ruse.
- But why?

36:00.011 --> 36:04.100
Easton gets arrested only to lie
about his wife's abduction?

36:04.101 --> 36:06.140
Sending the police all over the city.

36:06.379 --> 36:08.971
So that he can go after someone inside.

36:08.971 --> 36:11.100
- The precinct.
- Oh, no.

36:11.101 --> 36:13.760
Harold, perhaps
a more pertinent question is...

36:13.761 --> 36:15.510
Who the hell is Terry Easton?

36:27.181 --> 36:28.640
You.

36:28.641 --> 36:31.490
Did you really think you could betray me

36:32.391 --> 36:34.619
and live to tell about it?

36:37.931 --> 36:39.523
How?

36:40.101 --> 36:43.891
Cleanliness is all.

36:49.601 --> 36:52.640
- I'm out.
- That makes two of us.

36:52.641 --> 36:54.760
Got to get to one of their weapons.

36:54.761 --> 36:56.600
Mr. Reese, I finally
tracked down the source

36:56.601 --> 36:58.060
of the detonation signal.

36:58.061 --> 37:00.430
It's coming from inside the precinct.

37:00.431 --> 37:03.140
Easton's wife isn't real
and he's not a victim.

37:03.141 --> 37:05.430
He's the perpetrator. It's him.

37:05.431 --> 37:07.491
Sorry, Detective.

37:09.471 --> 37:11.720
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

37:11.721 --> 37:13.220
No!

37:13.221 --> 37:14.476
Lionel!

37:15.801 --> 37:17.560
Look out, there's another Templario.

37:24.471 --> 37:26.138
You okay?

37:26.891 --> 37:29.300
Yeah, Just grazed me,
that son of a bitch.

37:29.301 --> 37:31.234
I still got a guy in the room.

37:37.221 --> 37:40.756
Finch, Fusco's been shot.

37:41.391 --> 37:44.800
And Easton, or whoever the hell he is,

37:44.801 --> 37:46.306
he got away.

38:18.351 --> 38:21.470
Hi, you're probably wondering
how I traced your call.

38:21.471 --> 38:23.220
I followed the detonation signal

38:23.221 --> 38:24.800
to your base of operations.

38:24.801 --> 38:26.560
Your encryption is impressive,

38:26.561 --> 38:27.970
along with that app on your phone

38:27.971 --> 38:29.970
that modulates your voice,

38:30.307 --> 38:32.391
but what's really ingenious

38:32.391 --> 38:34.350
is the call you made to yourself

38:34.351 --> 38:35.707
in the precinct.

38:36.011 --> 38:38.010
A recording that allowed you

38:38.011 --> 38:41.467
to assume the role of a victim.

38:44.801 --> 38:46.819
Even your getaway car,

38:47.471 --> 38:50.680
registered under another alias

38:50.681 --> 38:53.800
in a spot perfectly removed
from street cameras.

38:53.801 --> 38:56.220
A precaution at every turn.

38:56.221 --> 38:59.094
Evidently not cautious enough.

39:01.971 --> 39:04.220
No, you've wreaked enough havoc.

39:04.221 --> 39:08.301
Blackmail, extortion, abduction, murder.

39:09.511 --> 39:12.511
You can't be permitted to continue.

39:13.971 --> 39:15.720
Turn yourself in.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.720
I've already done that once today.

39:17.721 --> 39:20.641
I wouldn't cross Harold.

39:23.641 --> 39:25.789
Elias...

39:26.851 --> 39:28.720
I'm not surprised you're alive,

39:28.721 --> 39:31.640
but I must say I never thought
you'd run with someone like him.

39:31.641 --> 39:33.640
Harold's a friend,

39:33.641 --> 39:35.581
one of the few I have left.

39:38.181 --> 39:39.890
A truce then.

39:49.061 --> 39:51.010
Careful...

39:51.011 --> 39:53.237
compassion and loyalty

39:53.801 --> 39:56.069
make people weak,

39:57.261 --> 39:59.221
easy to exploit.

39:59.721 --> 40:01.930
Well, that's some stinking thinking

40:01.931 --> 40:04.010
and why you're gonna lose.

40:04.011 --> 40:05.981
Not today.

40:11.471 --> 40:14.140
Be seeing you.

40:24.801 --> 40:26.560
I think that's far enough, don't you?

40:40.011 --> 40:43.640
Come on, Harold,
you brought me for a reason.

40:43.641 --> 40:46.600
You must have know
I'd do something like this.

41:09.141 --> 41:10.140
How's your arm?

41:12.471 --> 41:15.181
Gonna take more than a bullet
to keep me down.

41:16.301 --> 41:18.970
It's time we had a talk, Lionel.

41:22.181 --> 41:23.850
So what are we doing here?

41:23.851 --> 41:25.970
You're not gonna propose to me, are you?

41:25.971 --> 41:27.701
Give me your phone.

41:28.431 --> 41:29.837
Why?

41:30.431 --> 41:32.462
What the hell'd you do that for?

41:33.601 --> 41:35.600
You never know who might be listening.

41:35.601 --> 41:37.930
It wasn't even turned on.

41:39.471 --> 41:41.485
What's going on?

41:43.011 --> 41:45.422
Those questions you've been asking?

41:46.141 --> 41:48.317
You deserve answers.

41:49.511 --> 41:52.180
Mr. Reese, are you certain
that disclosing the truth

41:52.181 --> 41:54.850
to Detective Fusco is a wise choice?

41:54.851 --> 41:57.680
These days,
even the precinct's not safe.

41:57.681 --> 41:59.827
So maybe the best we can do is...

42:00.301 --> 42:02.654
trust each other.

42:06.891 --> 42:08.861
Very well,

42:09.761 --> 42:13.100
but there's an urgent matter now
that requires your attendance

42:13.101 --> 42:15.220
after you're finished.

42:20.511 --> 42:23.970
There's a system listening
through every microphone,

42:23.971 --> 42:26.390
watching through every camera.
