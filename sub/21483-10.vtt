WEBVTT

00:01.540 --> 00:02.474
Nice force.

00:03.026 --> 00:04.906
Nice arm bar, AJ, yes.

00:05.026 --> 00:06.025
Kevin.

00:07.020 --> 00:08.013
Good aggression.

00:08.015 --> 00:09.005
Looking really good.

00:09.007 --> 00:10.003
Thank you.

00:10.005 --> 00:11.005
Nice.

00:11.007 --> 00:11.957
Are you sure we're not
supposed to wear a cup?

00:12.077 --> 00:12.965
Somebody just bumped my twig.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.830
I'm sure your twig is
going to be just fine.

00:14.950 --> 00:16.079
Okay.

00:16.081 --> 00:18.080
Are you sure you're not an athlete?

00:18.082 --> 00:21.078
Well, I used to do Zumba at the Y, but...
this is a little different.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
Looking really good.

00:22.082 --> 00:23.081
Thank you.

00:23.083 --> 00:24.080
All right, guys.

00:24.082 --> 00:25.079
Everybody partner up.

00:25.081 --> 00:26.081
Oh, Kev, you're with me.

00:26.083 --> 00:27.082
Yeah, over here.

00:27.084 --> 00:28.082
Okay.

00:28.084 --> 00:30.150
In Krav Maga, we want to be
able to defend ourselves from

00:30.152 --> 00:31.285
any situation, any angle.

00:31.287 --> 00:34.159
Your assailant can come at you
with a big bear hug, so... come

00:34.161 --> 00:35.095
on, bear hug, right?

00:35.097 --> 00:36.096
Okay.

00:36.098 --> 00:37.097
Yeah, grab me, right?

00:37.099 --> 00:40.170
So we've been through some of the
frontal attacks, but today,

00:40.172 --> 00:43.073
I really want to focus
on coming from behind.

00:43.075 --> 00:44.644
Put your hands on my chest.

00:44.646 --> 00:46.880
On my... on my chest.

00:46.882 --> 00:48.381
Okay.

00:48.383 --> 00:49.883
Chest, right?

00:49.885 --> 00:52.887
You're going to grab the
assailant's right thumb out to

00:52.889 --> 00:56.726
the side, step, elbow...
and spin around.

00:56.728 --> 01:00.129
Assailant is down-- mount
and finish him off!

01:00.131 --> 01:02.911
Dismount, one more time--
mount and finish him off!

01:03.031 --> 01:03.925
Got that?

01:04.495 --> 01:05.741
You okay, Kevin?

01:05.861 --> 01:07.089
You good?

01:07.045 --> 01:07.763
Yeah.

01:08.114 --> 01:08.920
Yeah.

01:09.345 --> 01:15.518

01:16.146 --> 01:18.348
She took my hand and moved
it down to her breast.

01:18.350 --> 01:20.352
And the problem is what?

01:20.354 --> 01:22.354
I just feel like I'm crossing a line.

01:22.356 --> 01:24.357
She was hitting on me, essentially.

01:24.359 --> 01:25.357
And then she blew you?

01:25.359 --> 01:26.358
There's no blow jobs.

01:26.360 --> 01:27.360
Yeah, it's Krav Maga.

01:27.362 --> 01:28.361
Taken classes before.

01:28.363 --> 01:30.363
You do all that stuff, and then
they blow you in the bathroom.

01:30.365 --> 01:31.431
No, no, there's no blow jobs.

01:31.433 --> 01:33.434
No, you're not doing Krav Maga.

01:33.436 --> 01:35.503
Okay, here's what I'm going to do.

01:35.505 --> 01:36.504
I'm just going to tell Jenny.

01:36.506 --> 01:38.572
That way, we can clear the air
and she doesn't have to...

01:38.574 --> 01:39.506
No, no, no, no.

01:39.508 --> 01:40.507
Why?

01:40.509 --> 01:41.508
You don't tell Jenny.

01:41.510 --> 01:42.509
Why?

01:42.511 --> 01:44.511
Because you've done nothing wrong.

01:44.513 --> 01:45.512
You're not cheating on her.

01:45.514 --> 01:47.513
This is all incidental contact, okay?

01:47.515 --> 01:50.516
I'm within five yards, so it's kind of...
That's bump and run.

01:50.518 --> 01:51.517
That's bump and run.

01:51.519 --> 01:52.519
Enjoy the sport.

01:52.521 --> 01:53.520
It's sex with someone else.

01:53.522 --> 01:55.055
It has nothing to do with Jenny.

01:55.057 --> 01:56.657
Thank you!

01:56.659 --> 01:59.893
You want to start a prank war with me?

01:59.895 --> 02:00.894
Oh, you got my gifts?

02:00.896 --> 02:04.130
They're not gifts when you
subscribe someone to 40 obscure

02:04.132 --> 02:05.966
magazines and bill them later.

02:05.968 --> 02:09.904
<i>Young Miss,</i> uh, <i>Surgery
Today, Bass Chasers... Ooh.</i>

02:09.906 --> 02:10.906
<i>Polish Food Monthly?</i>

02:10.907 --> 02:12.908
<i>There's a lot to be
learned about pierogis.</i>

02:12.910 --> 02:14.910
<i>How about</i> <i>Miniature Donkey Talk?</i>

02:14.912 --> 02:15.912
<i>How do you feel about that one?</i>

02:15.914 --> 02:18.081
<i>I feel like regular donkey
talk is too broad of a topic.</i>

02:18.083 --> 02:20.717
<i>There's one in here I can't even
bring myself to touch yet.</i>

02:20.719 --> 02:22.086
<i>It's called</i> <i>Him.</i>

02:22.088 --> 02:23.320
<i>Oh, I love</i> <i>Him.</i>

02:23.322 --> 02:24.322
<i>Did a great article on cravats.</i>

02:24.324 --> 02:26.324
<i>Yeah, I filled it out at Andre's loft.</i>

02:26.326 --> 02:29.326
<i>You may have won the battle on
this one, but I will destroy you.</i>

02:29.328 --> 02:31.328
<i>Who's got the bass fishing one?</i>

02:31.330 --> 02:32.329
<i>I do--</i> <i>Bass Chasers.</i>

02:32.331 --> 02:33.331
<i>Let me see it.</i>

02:33.333 --> 02:35.333
<i>Oh, there's an article...
I like the fish one.</i>

02:35.335 --> 02:36.567
<i>Oh, Goddamn it, Taco.</i>

02:36.569 --> 02:37.568
<i>This is ruined.</i>

02:37.570 --> 02:38.569
<i>Who cares?</i>

02:38.571 --> 02:39.570
<i>It's just a tie.</i>

02:39.572 --> 02:41.639
<i>Well, I have to wear them every day, so...
and they're</i>

02:41.641 --> 02:43.574
<i>expensive, I have a limited amount.</i>

02:43.576 --> 02:45.576
<i>You know what would make it easier?</i>

02:45.578 --> 02:47.578
<i>If there were a service like
Netflix, but for neckties.</i>

02:47.580 --> 02:50.448
<i>You know, you don't have to buy a
bunch of ties-- you just get</i>

02:50.450 --> 02:52.517
<i>two in the mail every week,
return them once you wear them,</i>

02:52.519 --> 02:53.452
<i>get two new ones.</i>

02:53.454 --> 02:55.921
<i>Neckflix-- Netflix, but for neckties.</i>

02:55.923 --> 02:58.924
<i>Or you can skip the ties entirely
and just go with the T-necks.</i>

02:58.926 --> 03:01.059
<i>Oh, you mean like a
foreskin for your neck.</i>

03:01.061 --> 03:02.127
<i>It's not foreskin.</i>

03:02.129 --> 03:04.763
<i>Taco, that might be
legitimately the best idea</i>

03:04.765 --> 03:05.697
<i>you've ever come up with.</i>

03:05.699 --> 03:06.698
<i>Seriously.</i>

03:06.700 --> 03:08.700
<i>What about the live rocking horse?</i>

03:08.702 --> 03:11.637
<i>$30 of wood, a hammer and some
nails turns that useless horse</i>

03:11.639 --> 03:13.639
<i>into a beloved children's toy.</i>

03:15.376 --> 03:16.775
<i>Hello.</i>

03:16.777 --> 03:17.776
<i>Hi.</i>

03:17.778 --> 03:18.777
<i>Ugh.</i>

03:18.779 --> 03:21.012
<i>We're from the Light of Genesis,
here to deliver your</i>

03:21.014 --> 03:21.947
<i>specialty Bible.</i>

03:21.949 --> 03:24.783
<i>Thank you for checking the box
online that said that you'd like</i>

03:24.785 --> 03:26.885
<i>to learn more about our
organization in person.</i>

03:26.887 --> 03:27.919
<i>Yeah, very funny, Pete.</i>

03:27.921 --> 03:29.087
<i>Very good payback prank.</i>

03:29.089 --> 03:31.156
<i>We'd like to just talk to you a
little bit about the Light</i>

03:31.158 --> 03:32.090
<i>of Genesis.</i>

03:32.092 --> 03:34.159
<i>This is probably that point in
the conversation you're all</i>

03:34.161 --> 03:36.896
<i>too familiar with, where I
shut the door in your faces.</i>

03:36.898 --> 03:39.866
<i>He's forsaken the path to truth
just as Pettigrew's ankle</i>

03:39.868 --> 03:41.067
<i>has forsaken him.</i>

03:41.069 --> 03:43.170
<i>Whoa, I'm sorry, you just
said something about...</i>

03:43.172 --> 03:44.104
<i>Brandon Pettigrew?</i>

03:44.106 --> 03:47.174
<i>Yes, woe has befallen Pettigrew's
ankle, and the Lord</i>

03:47.176 --> 03:49.510
<i>today will see him paying
penance for it on the bench.</i>

03:49.512 --> 03:50.511
<i>When did this happen?</i>

03:50.513 --> 03:52.514
<i>Oh, just this morn, but Tony
Scheffler will heed the call.</i>

03:53.517 --> 03:55.517
<i>Well, Scheffler's light
has faded since Denver.</i>

03:55.519 --> 03:57.519
<i>But he will rise again in Detroit.</i>

03:57.521 --> 03:59.521
<i>How did you find this out before me?</i>

03:59.523 --> 04:02.191
<i>Our religion, the Light of
Genesis, forbids any drugs or</i>

04:02.193 --> 04:05.061
<i>alcohol or engaging in sexual
intercourse with women, so our</i>

04:05.063 --> 04:08.665
<i>only real peccadillo is fantasy
football, and we love it.</i>

04:08.667 --> 04:09.833
<i>It's our one clean vice.</i>

04:09.835 --> 04:10.834
<i>Praise be. Praise be.</i>

04:10.836 --> 04:11.835
<i>Praise be.</i>

04:11.837 --> 04:12.970
<i>Praise "C," huh.</i>

04:12.972 --> 04:15.139
<i>Hey, I'm not going to win
the Shiva if I don't get a</i>

04:15.141 --> 04:16.074
<i>running back.</i>

04:16.076 --> 04:18.276
<i>You have very nice running backs.</i>

04:18.278 --> 04:19.310
<i>I do.</i>

04:19.312 --> 04:21.713
<i>Are you offering me bacon
for a running back?</i>

04:21.714 --> 04:23.449
<i>For a running back.</i>

04:23.451 --> 04:24.550
<i>Nope.</i>

04:24.552 --> 04:26.952
<i>You are on your own, and Daddy
has his own problems to</i>

04:26.954 --> 04:27.887
<i>worry about.</i>

04:27.889 --> 04:29.955
<i>I'm going to go to work, but
I wanted to see what you</i>

04:29.957 --> 04:31.890
<i>were thinking about for dinner tonight.</i>

04:31.892 --> 04:33.892
<i>You have Krav Maga after work.</i>

04:33.894 --> 04:38.062
<i>About the Krav Maga-- I have a
distinct feeling that my Krav</i>

04:38.064 --> 04:44.501
<i>Maga teacher is... like...
hitting on me-- like, sexually.</i>

04:44.503 --> 04:45.535
<i>Really?</i>

04:45.537 --> 04:47.871
<i>Yeah, she's, like, in... into me.</i>

04:47.873 --> 04:50.006
<i>Sounds like she has a
wicked case of the Kevins.</i>

04:50.008 --> 04:51.107
<i>That's right, she does.</i>

04:51.109 --> 04:53.543
<i>What if the whole class
catches a case of the Kevins?</i>

04:53.545 --> 04:56.046
<i>Now you're making a joke
of the whole situation.</i>

04:56.048 --> 04:57.114
<i>I got a lot to offer.</i>

04:57.116 --> 04:58.115
<i>Which is the problem.</i>

04:58.117 --> 05:01.753
<i>So you go to that class
and get less fat.</i>

05:01.755 --> 05:03.311
<i>Well, you're the one
that gave me bacon.</i>

05:03.431 --> 05:04.580
<i>That was business.</i>

05:04.700 --> 05:05.318
<i>Go.</i>

05:05.438 --> 05:07.025
<i>Fine.</i>

05:09.750 --> 05:11.451
Okay, Mrs. Crabtree.

05:11.453 --> 05:12.685
Jenny?

05:12.687 --> 05:13.653
Hey.

05:13.655 --> 05:14.687
What's going on?

05:14.689 --> 05:17.123
Oh, I made up a fake
name to be discreet.

05:17.125 --> 05:18.190
It was silly-- I know.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.525
You want to get this little
miss "A" cup into a "C" cup.

05:20.527 --> 05:21.526
Am I right?

05:21.528 --> 05:22.527
What? No!

05:22.529 --> 05:23.795
Get a little Botox, maybe?

05:23.797 --> 05:24.795
No, I'm good.

05:24.797 --> 05:25.796
I got it.

05:25.798 --> 05:31.636
You want to surprise Kevin with a
little vaginal rejuvenation surgery.

05:31.638 --> 05:32.870
No.

05:32.872 --> 05:35.139
What I am about to share with
you does not leave this room.

05:35.141 --> 05:36.140
It's a secret?

05:36.142 --> 05:37.141
Yes.

05:37.143 --> 05:39.143
Oh, well, you can tell me anything.

05:39.145 --> 05:41.144
Okay, just back up a
little bit, all right?

05:41.146 --> 05:43.213
Okay, uh...
it's called bedside manner, okay?

05:43.215 --> 05:45.549
Yeah, bedside, not in my bed.

05:45.551 --> 05:46.550
Fine, I'll back up.

05:46.552 --> 05:47.551
All right.

05:47.553 --> 05:48.552
Okay.

05:48.554 --> 05:49.720
I need a tattoo removed.

05:49.722 --> 05:50.721
Jenny, come on.

05:50.723 --> 05:52.722
That's nothing to be embarrassed about.

05:52.724 --> 05:53.790
It's just, I have a daughter.

05:53.792 --> 05:56.058
I'd like to raise her
to be a classy lady.

05:56.060 --> 05:57.460
Ellie?

05:57.462 --> 05:58.728
Good luck.

05:58.730 --> 05:59.728
What does that mean?

05:59.730 --> 06:00.729
Nothing.

06:00.731 --> 06:01.730
Sorry.

06:01.732 --> 06:03.732
Okay, uh...
I've seen hundreds of these.

06:03.734 --> 06:07.502
No reason to be embarrassed, okay?

06:07.504 --> 06:09.605
Oh... oh, my.

06:09.607 --> 06:10.840
"Pleasure chest"?

06:10.842 --> 06:11.841
Wow.

06:11.843 --> 06:12.942
Does Kevin know about this?

06:12.944 --> 06:14.244
Does... Yes.

06:14.246 --> 06:15.813
We have a kid together.

06:15.815 --> 06:19.817
How much was this in use if you
needed to advertise it as a

06:19.819 --> 06:21.653
location stop on your body?

06:21.655 --> 06:25.791
Look, I don't need your medical opinion
on how horrible this tattoo is.

06:25.793 --> 06:27.025
Okay, you know, this is easy.

06:27.027 --> 06:29.261
Two, three sessions max, we'll
just laser it right off.

06:29.263 --> 06:31.263
You're not going to say a word, right?

06:31.265 --> 06:32.265
I mean, look who I am.

06:32.267 --> 06:33.266
I'm a doctor.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.267
You can trust me.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.635
I will not betray you.

06:35.637 --> 06:36.636
Not a word.

06:36.638 --> 06:39.105
Not a word.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.773
Not a word, Andre!

06:40.775 --> 06:42.942
Not a word.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.677
Good, AJ, good.

06:44.679 --> 06:47.714
90-degree angles-- keep that,
with the wrist on wrist.

06:47.716 --> 06:48.715
Ow!

06:48.717 --> 06:49.716
Boop!

06:49.718 --> 06:50.717
That's not funny, dude.

06:50.719 --> 06:51.718
Don't go near my dick.

06:51.720 --> 06:52.719
Sorry.

06:52.721 --> 06:53.720
Okay, boys, bring it in.

06:53.722 --> 06:54.721
Bring it in.

06:54.723 --> 06:56.891
All right, we're going to
review some moves now.

06:56.893 --> 06:58.225
I'm going to need a volunteer.

06:58.227 --> 06:59.226
Right here.

06:59.228 --> 07:00.995
Um... Kevin, come.

07:00.997 --> 07:01.996
Uh, Pete-- he's new.

07:01.998 --> 07:02.997
He's my buddy.

07:02.999 --> 07:03.998
Yeah, yeah.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.033
Go get 'em, Pete!

07:05.035 --> 07:06.034
How's it going?

07:06.036 --> 07:09.037
All right, we're going to, uh, go
over some of the frontal attacks.

07:09.039 --> 07:10.038
Frontal.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.039
And let's start with the
double-hand grab, okay?

07:12.041 --> 07:13.040
Frontal two-handed grab?

07:13.042 --> 07:14.041
Just... all right.

07:14.043 --> 07:16.043
Feel like I should buy you a
drink first or something.

07:16.045 --> 07:17.044
Don't make it awkward.

07:17.046 --> 07:18.045
Grab me.

07:18.047 --> 07:19.046
All right, let's get to it.

07:19.048 --> 07:20.047
Okay.

07:21.050 --> 07:22.049
The old one-hander?

07:22.051 --> 07:23.050
Is that...?

07:23.052 --> 07:24.051
No, uh, maybe you're a lefty.

07:24.053 --> 07:25.052
Here we go.

07:26.222 --> 07:28.556
That's how you repel a two-handed grab.

07:28.558 --> 07:29.890
You see that?

07:29.892 --> 07:31.058
Oh... busted!

07:31.060 --> 07:32.526
Nothing sexual about that.

07:32.528 --> 07:34.561
Knocked your ass out, son.

07:36.266 --> 07:37.665
Dick.

07:37.667 --> 07:40.168
All right, we're going to go
over one more move, you guys.

07:40.170 --> 07:43.038
Okay...
Kevin, I need you as a volunteer.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.039
Come here.

07:44.041 --> 07:46.041
We're going to go over a
new move called the Lever.

07:46.043 --> 07:48.277
Remember, we're going to start
with your hands on my chest.

07:48.279 --> 07:50.112
Hands on my chest.

07:50.114 --> 07:51.547
There you go-- right there.

07:51.549 --> 07:55.251
We're going to do a double thumb
break, step to the side, groin,

07:55.253 --> 07:57.953
elbow up and pop to the face.

07:57.955 --> 07:59.088
All right?

07:59.090 --> 08:00.557
I'm going to break that down.

08:00.559 --> 08:03.226
Groin, elbow up, to the face.

08:03.228 --> 08:06.197
Groin, elbow up and to the face.

08:06.199 --> 08:07.864
Groin is very sensitive.

08:07.866 --> 08:09.233
Very important in Krav Maga.

08:09.235 --> 08:11.769
Groin, elbow up.

08:11.771 --> 08:13.737
Groin, elbow up.

08:13.739 --> 08:14.871
Got it?

08:14.873 --> 08:15.972
And then to the face.

08:15.974 --> 08:17.240
Really good.

08:17.242 --> 08:18.242
Thank you.

08:18.244 --> 08:19.243
Really god job, Kevin.

08:19.245 --> 08:22.879
Okay, think we got that one.

08:22.881 --> 08:25.081
Are you sure it wasn't a graze?

08:25.083 --> 08:26.083
No, no, it wasn't a graze.

08:26.085 --> 08:28.084
It was at least a half full stroke.

08:28.086 --> 08:30.087
So what exactly constitutes a stroke?

08:30.089 --> 08:32.155
Like, are we talking about when
you're sitting on the couch and

08:32.157 --> 08:33.089
you do a lift and separate?

08:33.091 --> 08:35.092
Oh, no, that's a classic
rerack-- that's involuntary.

08:35.094 --> 08:37.094
So this was, like, a
coordinated effort?

08:37.096 --> 08:38.095
Know what?

08:38.097 --> 08:39.096
Maybe I have it wrong.

08:39.097 --> 08:40.097
Maybe I was the one out of line.

08:40.099 --> 08:42.099
Could have been part of the move.

08:42.101 --> 08:44.101
It could have been part of the move.

08:44.102 --> 08:46.102
Is that what we think Krav Maga is?

08:46.104 --> 08:48.104
The old Israeli art of hand
jibber to hand jibber combat?

08:48.106 --> 08:49.105
I don't know what to do.

08:49.107 --> 08:51.108
I told Jenny, and she
said I was overreacting.

08:51.110 --> 08:52.108
Whoa!

08:52.110 --> 08:54.110
Okay, then you have a
loophole, my friend.

08:54.112 --> 08:56.112
It is not cheating; it is Krav Maga.

08:56.114 --> 08:57.113
This is your little secret.

08:57.115 --> 08:58.114
Enjoy it.

08:58.116 --> 09:01.584
Actually, as long as we are telling
secrets, um, I have a great one.

09:01.586 --> 09:02.585
Nobody cares.

09:02.587 --> 09:04.587
How about we do it like a blind item?

09:04.589 --> 09:07.824
What person who we all know
was in a very unusual place?

09:07.826 --> 09:10.427
Ooh, I know-- Andre,
in a woman's vagina.

09:10.429 --> 09:11.428
There it is.

09:11.430 --> 09:13.430
That's a strange place for you to be.

09:13.432 --> 09:15.433
If you have something to
tell us, then tell us.

09:15.435 --> 09:16.434
I can't.

09:16.436 --> 09:17.435
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

09:17.437 --> 09:18.436
Oop, I've said too much.

09:18.438 --> 09:19.437
We really don't care.

09:19.439 --> 09:21.439
Fine, you don't deserve to know.

09:21.441 --> 09:23.508
I'm going to leave it for myself
on voice mail because I need to

09:23.510 --> 09:24.443
say it out loud.

09:24.445 --> 09:25.444
Okay, bye.

09:25.446 --> 09:26.445
Oh, Andre.

09:26.447 --> 09:28.714
Okay, so... We still don't care.

09:28.716 --> 09:29.948
Please leave.

09:29.950 --> 09:33.219
Thank you.

09:33.221 --> 09:36.255
All right, just keep it together.

09:36.257 --> 09:38.057
Hello, friend.

09:38.059 --> 09:39.058
Hi.

09:39.060 --> 09:40.259
Is there a problem?

09:40.261 --> 09:42.227
Uh... yeah, actually.

09:42.229 --> 09:46.265
I have this secret, and it's so good,
and it's burning a hole in me.

09:46.267 --> 09:47.266
I just got to tell somebody.

09:47.268 --> 09:48.267
Can I tell you?

09:48.269 --> 09:49.268
Of course.

09:49.270 --> 09:50.269
We all have secrets.

09:50.271 --> 09:51.270
Wow, okay.

09:51.272 --> 09:54.273
My best friend, Jenny, is married
to my best friend, Kevin.

09:54.275 --> 09:56.275
Now, Jenny comes to my work
'cause she's got a tattoo;

09:56.277 --> 09:57.276
she wants me to remove it.

09:57.278 --> 09:59.278
And I was like, "Does
Kevin know about it?"

09:59.280 --> 10:01.281
She's like, "Yeah,
Kevin knows about it."

10:01.283 --> 10:03.283
Sir, you might want to sort of
streamline the information.

10:03.285 --> 10:05.285
Oh, yeah, so she's like,
"I need this removed."

10:05.287 --> 10:07.554
And I'm like, "Please.
I could do that, no problem."

10:07.556 --> 10:10.356
You guys notice Ruxin made some
pretty bold lineup choices

10:10.358 --> 10:11.658
for Thursday night's game?

10:11.660 --> 10:14.827
He started Marshawn Lynch against
Philly, and it actually worked.

10:14.829 --> 10:15.828
Where is he getting his intel?

10:15.830 --> 10:18.364
And as the Lord turns his
all-seeing eye onto Carolina's

10:18.366 --> 10:23.369
backfield this week, do you think it's
praise be Jonathan Stewart or praise be

10:23.371 --> 10:24.537
DeAngelo Williams?

10:24.539 --> 10:25.571
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:25.573 --> 10:26.571
What's that?

10:26.573 --> 10:27.572
Is that Ruxin?

10:27.574 --> 10:28.573
And who is he with?

10:28.575 --> 10:29.574
He doesn't have any friends.

10:29.576 --> 10:32.911
We'll just have to look at a couple things, but...
Hey, Ruxin, what the hell is

10:32.913 --> 10:33.911
going on?

10:33.913 --> 10:34.912
Oh, I found salvation.

10:34.914 --> 10:37.181
You see, we've been spreading
the Good Word in the

10:37.183 --> 10:40.918
neighborhood with my brothers,
Gabriel, Ezekiel, Julian and Hank.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.619
Hey, friend.

10:42.621 --> 10:43.920
How are you?

10:43.922 --> 10:46.322
Uh, we should get out
of here, right, guys?

10:46.324 --> 10:48.325
No, no, we need to
meet Ruxin's friends.

10:48.327 --> 10:49.793
See you, weird guys.

10:49.795 --> 10:51.928
Thank you for bringing me
to the Light of Genesis.

10:51.930 --> 10:54.197
Your friends seem nice,
but lost and wandering.

10:54.199 --> 10:55.332
You know, we could help them.

10:55.334 --> 11:00.137
Yeah, I think they're beyond salvation,
just like the 49ers' defense.

11:00.139 --> 11:02.739
Seriously, what's going on
with the 49ers' defense?

11:02.741 --> 11:05.709
So you got Ruxin to join a cult?

11:05.711 --> 11:07.712
That's it-- prank war is over.

11:07.714 --> 11:08.746
You won, buddy.

11:08.748 --> 11:11.282
You know, normally I would
agree, but something's wrong.

11:11.284 --> 11:13.150
He's legitimately into it.

11:13.152 --> 11:15.286
Yeah, maybe it's their awesome ties.

11:15.288 --> 11:18.623
Man, that is the kind of
inventory I need at Neckflix.

11:18.625 --> 11:22.293
Speaking of which, your first
two ties have arrived.

11:22.295 --> 11:26.797
Oh... um, I got a tie
that I already own.

11:26.799 --> 11:28.933
That's why I'm saying I need more ties.

11:28.935 --> 11:31.235
All I have is 15 of his
stupid, ugly ties.

11:31.237 --> 11:32.236
I'm not paying for this.

11:32.238 --> 11:35.240
Well, then, you're going to have
to pay the $200 cancellation fee.

11:35.242 --> 11:36.307
Oh, praise be, my brothers.

11:36.309 --> 11:38.643
What is with all this cult shit?

11:38.645 --> 11:40.645
You look like a guy who gets
beat up by the Mormons.

11:40.647 --> 11:43.815
Oh, laugh all you want, Kevin,
but the Light of Genesis

11:43.817 --> 11:46.317
has helped guide me through
life's most thorny questions.

11:46.319 --> 11:47.318
Like what?

11:47.320 --> 11:48.319
Like: who will the Patriots'

11:48.321 --> 11:50.588
number one receiver be this weekend?

11:50.590 --> 11:53.325
Praise be Wes Welker or
praise be Rob Gronkowski?

11:53.327 --> 11:55.627
The cult guys are into
fantasy football?

11:55.629 --> 11:58.262
My brothers are God's fantasy warriors.

11:58.264 --> 12:00.264
We share our knowledge
with one another.

12:00.266 --> 12:01.265
Wait a second.

12:01.267 --> 12:03.601
So they're probably not good
about keeping secrets, are they?

12:03.603 --> 12:05.669
Whatever my brother knows, I know.

12:05.671 --> 12:06.670
Is Jenny home?

12:06.672 --> 12:08.672
Yeah, she's floating around somewhere.

12:08.674 --> 12:09.773
Be right back.

12:09.775 --> 12:10.774
Poor lost Andre.

12:10.776 --> 12:14.277
I remember when I was like him,
but that'll all change on Sunday

12:14.279 --> 12:17.013
when I'm officially baptized
into the Light of Genesis and

12:17.015 --> 12:19.282
all of their knowledge will be mine.

12:19.284 --> 12:22.151
You're joining a cult to get
fantasy football information?

12:22.153 --> 12:25.654
Oh, Pete, "cult" is such a
pejorative term, like "creep"

12:25.656 --> 12:26.722
or Andre.

12:26.724 --> 12:30.793
Nay, the Light of Genesis is a
path than can help one visualize

12:30.795 --> 12:34.196
one's life, and the visualization
that I have right

12:34.198 --> 12:36.733
now is of me holding the Shiva.

12:36.735 --> 12:39.136
That's it-- visualization.

12:39.138 --> 12:42.873
Crazy Cult Ruxin, tell Lawyer
Ruxin to write this down.

12:42.875 --> 12:45.877
I need to apply
visualization to Neckflix.

12:45.879 --> 12:49.313
I can no longer be your lawyer,
as I serve a higher power now.

12:49.315 --> 12:51.682
There is no higher
power than Taco Corp.

12:51.684 --> 12:55.385
Peace be with you, my brothers, and
also with backup Oakland running back,

12:55.387 --> 12:56.653
Taiwan Jones.

12:56.655 --> 12:59.489
I'm going to  crush
you guys this week.

12:59.491 --> 13:02.058
I knew it-- he's in there.

13:02.060 --> 13:04.026
Hey, Jenny.

13:04.028 --> 13:05.161
Can I sit down?

13:05.163 --> 13:07.062
Sure.

13:07.064 --> 13:13.002
I just want you to know that I value our
friendship paramount to anything else.

13:13.004 --> 13:14.037
Okay.

13:14.039 --> 13:16.039
I told your secret to somebody.

13:16.041 --> 13:17.107
No... Andre!

13:17.109 --> 13:18.208
I didn't mean to.

13:18.210 --> 13:20.343
I didn't... I told a stranger, and
I thought it was going to be

13:20.345 --> 13:22.779
okay, but now that stranger's
not a stranger; he's part of

13:22.781 --> 13:24.914
Ruxin's cult, and now everyone's
going to know about it.

13:24.916 --> 13:26.016
I'm so sorry.

13:26.018 --> 13:30.053
I just want you to know, I will do
anything to make this up to you.

13:30.055 --> 13:31.187
You want a boob job?

13:31.189 --> 13:32.188
I don't need a boob job.

13:32.190 --> 13:34.191
Mmm... I don't!

13:34.193 --> 13:36.193
I'll throw in the vaginal
rejuvenation, too.

13:36.195 --> 13:38.195
We'll be all... You know what?

13:38.197 --> 13:41.298
I don't want you anywhere near my business,
and you clearly can't be trusted.

13:41.300 --> 13:43.033
I will do anything.

13:43.035 --> 13:44.635
Look at me-- I'm on bended knee.

13:44.637 --> 13:46.303
I am hurt.

13:46.305 --> 13:49.206
I am betrayed.

13:49.208 --> 13:54.112
I want Rashard Mendenhall
and LeSean McCoy.

13:54.114 --> 13:56.114
Yes, yes!

13:56.116 --> 13:57.549
That will make it better?

13:57.551 --> 13:59.251
Friends trade, right?

13:59.253 --> 14:00.920
Here it is-- trade accepted.

14:00.922 --> 14:01.988
Friends?

14:01.990 --> 14:03.589
We'll work on it.

14:08.691 --> 14:09.690
Jesus.

14:09.692 --> 14:10.859
Take it easy.

14:10.861 --> 14:12.160
Oh, wow.

14:12.162 --> 14:13.862
It's creepier than I thought.

14:13.864 --> 14:16.231
Only a place this creepy
would take Ruxin.

14:16.233 --> 14:19.233
Some of the Light of Genesis's
teachings aren't that creepy.

14:19.235 --> 14:21.469
I've been visualizing my
Neckflix business plan and, of

14:21.471 --> 14:22.503
course, listening to <i>Abacab.</i>

14:22.505 --> 14:24.572
<i>And let me tell you...
Taco, nobody cares about</i>

14:24.574 --> 14:25.506
<i>visualizing, all right?</i>

14:25.508 --> 14:27.941
<i>Can we just get Ruxin and get
out of here before he wins...</i>

14:27.943 --> 14:29.242
<i>Hello.</i>

14:29.244 --> 14:30.376
<i>Hi.</i>

14:30.378 --> 14:31.377
<i>Hello.</i>

14:31.379 --> 14:32.678
<i>Welcome, friends.</i>

14:32.680 --> 14:33.613
<i>Hey, how are you?</i>

14:33.615 --> 14:34.680
<i>There's so many of them.</i>

14:34.682 --> 14:36.716
<i>Welcome to the Light of Genesis.</i>

14:36.718 --> 14:38.885
<i>How may we show you... The light?</i>

14:38.887 --> 14:39.887
<i>A little bit faster.</i>

14:39.889 --> 14:41.889
<i>Well, thanks for the, uh, welcome.</i>

14:41.891 --> 14:43.891
<i>We are big fans of what you
guys have going on here.</i>

14:43.893 --> 14:44.892
<i>Huge Genesis guys.</i>

14:44.894 --> 14:46.894
<i>You know, to cut to the
chase, we want in.</i>

14:46.896 --> 14:48.963
<i>Well, before we can share the
light with you, you have to</i>

14:48.965 --> 14:50.898
<i>share the light with one another.</i>

14:50.900 --> 14:52.066
<i>We'll lead by example.</i>

14:52.068 --> 14:54.436
<i>Okay, you turn to your partner,
and you just extend the</i>

14:54.438 --> 14:58.673
<i>fellow finger-- just the tip--
touch it and express your</i>

14:58.675 --> 14:59.741
<i>appreciation.</i>

14:59.743 --> 15:03.778
<i>I appreciate your smile, and I
like how you say my name in</i>

15:03.780 --> 15:04.812
<i>your sleep.</i>

15:04.814 --> 15:07.214
<i>I like that you watch over me
when I dream, and I like the</i>

15:07.216 --> 15:09.750
<i>tiny shoulders that surround your head.</i>

15:09.752 --> 15:10.751
<i>It's easy.</i>

15:10.753 --> 15:11.751
<i>Now you try.</i>

15:11.753 --> 15:12.752
<i>No.</i>

15:12.754 --> 15:13.753
<i>No.</i>

15:13.755 --> 15:14.754
<i>I'll try it.</i>

15:14.756 --> 15:16.756
<i>No, no, you... Yeah, come on.</i>

15:16.758 --> 15:17.757
<i>We'll do it-- me and you.</i>

15:17.759 --> 15:19.760
<i>Yeah, you're going to need a partner.</i>

15:19.762 --> 15:20.760
<i>Go ahead, Kevin.</i>

15:20.762 --> 15:21.761
<i>No, I don't want to do it.</i>

15:21.763 --> 15:22.762
<i>Come on, try it.</i>

15:22.764 --> 15:24.831
<i>All right, do you have to...
He doesn't have to do the...</i>

15:24.833 --> 15:25.765
<i>the... this, right?</i>

15:25.767 --> 15:26.766
<i>It does feel better.</i>

15:26.768 --> 15:28.768
<i>It's optional, but you should.</i>

15:28.770 --> 15:30.770
<i>Can you just do it
Western grip, please?</i>

15:30.772 --> 15:31.771
<i>Thank you.</i>

15:31.773 --> 15:32.772
<i>Okay, fine, if I must.</i>

15:32.774 --> 15:34.841
<i>Kevin, I know you may disapprove
of your wife's tattoo, but I</i>

15:34.843 --> 15:37.778
<i>find it very...
What are you talking about-- tattoo?</i>

15:37.780 --> 15:39.813
<i>It's okay-- we're in a
safe circle right now.</i>

15:39.815 --> 15:42.115
<i>Secret is out, and, uh,
we can all share it.</i>

15:42.117 --> 15:43.116
<i>Jenny has a tattoo.</i>

15:43.118 --> 15:44.184
<i>She does not have a tattoo.</i>

15:44.186 --> 15:46.252
<i>The pleasure chest-- show him.</i>

15:46.254 --> 15:47.253
<i>I don't have a tattoo.</i>

15:47.255 --> 15:49.889
<i>In fact, what I showed you
the other day was fake.</i>

15:49.891 --> 15:51.791
<i>I don't have a tattoo.</i>

15:51.793 --> 15:52.826
<i>You tricked me.</i>

15:52.828 --> 15:58.198
<i>But what I do have-- pinky up--
because of your generosity,</i>

15:58.200 --> 16:01.836
<i>I have Rashard Mendenhall
and LeSean McCoy, sucker!</i>

16:01.838 --> 16:03.104
<i>I'll pinky on that.</i>

16:03.106 --> 16:04.172
<i>You like that, guys?</i>

16:04.174 --> 16:05.173
<i>Pinky love!</i>

16:05.175 --> 16:07.508
<i>I'll just finger myself, thank you.</i>

16:07.510 --> 16:09.911
<i>It's lovely to see you all sharing
in the light, and I wish</i>

16:09.913 --> 16:11.913
<i>we could stay here and bathe
with you, but I have a baptism</i>

16:11.915 --> 16:13.048
<i>to attend to.</i>

16:13.050 --> 16:16.851
<i>I'll be here even in my absencee
hugging you with my mind.</i>

16:16.853 --> 16:18.519
<i>Baptism!</i>

16:18.521 --> 16:20.855
<i>You know, that is something
we would really like to see.</i>

16:20.857 --> 16:23.491
<i>The baptism is only for elder members.</i>

16:23.493 --> 16:24.625
<i>Julian... come on.</i>

16:24.627 --> 16:25.860
<i>Come on, you can let us in.</i>

16:25.862 --> 16:27.862
<i>Well, I... I'm on thin ice already.</i>

16:27.864 --> 16:29.864
<i>Julian, we can be your
new best friends.</i>

16:29.866 --> 16:31.865
<i>Five new best friends, Julian.</i>

16:31.867 --> 16:34.467
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

16:37.305 --> 16:39.874
<i>May the light of Genesis be with you.</i>

16:39.876 --> 16:42.811
<i>Initiate, please kneel.</i>

16:42.813 --> 16:43.878
<i>Oh, Jesus, Ruxin.</i>

16:43.880 --> 16:45.580
<i>Today we welcome a new member.</i>

16:45.582 --> 16:47.883
<i>Shh, shh, please, just stay
here and be very quiet.</i>

16:47.885 --> 16:48.884
<i>You got it.</i>

16:48.886 --> 16:50.419
<i>Okay, enjoy the show.</i>

16:50.421 --> 16:51.753
<i>We'll be right here.</i>

16:51.755 --> 16:53.155
<i>We're not going anywhere, okay?</i>

16:53.157 --> 16:56.091
<i>Let us all bow our heads
and collect our thoughts</i>

16:56.093 --> 16:58.827
<i>in our bowl of consciousness.</i>

17:01.897 --> 17:04.698
<i>Oop, there's no room.</i>

17:06.300 --> 17:07.201
<i>You brought your lineup?</i>

17:07.203 --> 17:09.169
<i>Yes. Why should Ruxin get all the help?</i>

17:09.171 --> 17:11.069
<i>You know, there's a lot
room in this row.</i>

17:11.071 --> 17:11.838
<i>Just shh! Get back.</i>

17:11.839 --> 17:13.039
<i>Please.</i>

17:13.040 --> 17:14.040
<i>That felt good.</i>

17:14.041 --> 17:16.842
<i>Rise, initiate, and join
me at the baptismal.</i>

17:16.844 --> 17:19.712
<i>Guys, where's Taco?</i>

17:19.714 --> 17:24.585
<i>Bathroom...</i>

17:24.587 --> 17:26.587
<i>Hmm.</i>

17:31.627 --> 17:34.462
<i>Whoa! It worked!</i>

17:34.464 --> 17:38.733
<i>Visualize, manifestize.</i>

17:39.436 --> 17:41.936
<i>There are enough ties here to
keep Neckflix in business</i>

17:41.938 --> 17:42.803
<i>for years.</i>

17:42.805 --> 17:45.739
<i>There's something for every
demographic, every occasion.</i>

17:45.741 --> 17:51.443
<i>World Cup, poor person
wedding, your own funeral.</i>

17:51.445 --> 17:56.815
<i>Oh... thank you, Phil Collins,
Tony Banks, and to a lesser</i>

17:56.817 --> 17:58.483
<i>extent, Mike Rutherford.</i>

17:58.485 --> 18:01.453
<i>I forgive you guys</i> <i>for</i>
<i>We Can't Dance.</i> Oh!

18:01.455 --> 18:02.588
I am the light.

18:02.590 --> 18:03.822
Glory be to the word of truth.

18:03.824 --> 18:05.156
I am the light.

18:05.158 --> 18:08.593
- Glory be to the word of truth...
- and my lineup.

18:08.595 --> 18:12.429
Now let us join hands and
express our appreciation.

18:12.431 --> 18:17.602
Really?
I got to touch pinkies with you?

18:17.604 --> 18:21.807
Your soul to me is like an
eagle; it's ready to soar.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.842
You have hair like a lady.

18:23.844 --> 18:25.444
Thank you.

18:25.446 --> 18:26.679
Guys, this is bad.

18:26.681 --> 18:28.415
We got to stop this.

18:28.417 --> 18:31.285
I cannot have another year
of the brain of Ruxin.

18:31.287 --> 18:32.486
Do you accept the church?

18:32.488 --> 18:32.853
Mm-hmm.

18:32.855 --> 18:35.857
Do you promise to live by its
rules and obey its code?

18:35.859 --> 18:37.625
Totally.

18:37.627 --> 18:40.327
And once we all invite you
into the League of the Light

18:40.329 --> 18:43.597
of Genesis, do you swear to
forsake all other leagues?

18:43.599 --> 18:45.666
Well... Really?

18:45.668 --> 18:46.867
Is he gonna do this?

18:46.869 --> 18:47.602
My God.

18:47.604 --> 18:51.506
Do you also swear to renounce
other deities and false idols?

18:51.508 --> 18:52.640
Mm-hmm.

18:52.642 --> 18:56.177
- Shiva...
- Why are you resisting?

18:56.179 --> 18:58.212
Shiva... She sees you.

18:58.214 --> 18:59.647
Brother Ruxin...

18:59.649 --> 19:01.515
...you have to accept
before you tip your head.

19:01.517 --> 19:02.783
I just need a minute.

19:02.785 --> 19:03.817
Brother Ruxin?

19:03.819 --> 19:06.621
What will it be, Brother Ruxin?

19:06.623 --> 19:07.522
Ow! I can't! No!

19:07.524 --> 19:12.828
Shiva Komedi Somakanakram!

19:12.830 --> 19:14.497
We got our boy back!

19:14.499 --> 19:15.531
Whoo!

19:15.533 --> 19:15.865
Yes!

19:15.867 --> 19:18.667
I am in one cult, and it
is the cult of Shiva.

19:18.669 --> 19:21.203
And I'm the Grand
Poobah of that mother!

19:21.205 --> 19:22.838
Yeah!

19:22.840 --> 19:24.172
Boo! Face, son!

19:24.174 --> 19:27.075
Excuse me, Taco, how
did Neckflix begin?

19:27.077 --> 19:30.712
Well, I had a dream, I
visualized it, and I stole

19:30.714 --> 19:33.181
a bunch of ties from the church.

19:36.520 --> 19:37.854
Hey, Kev.

19:37.856 --> 19:39.122
You walking to the lot?

19:39.124 --> 19:40.089
Yeah.

19:40.091 --> 19:41.457
Me, too. I'll walk with you.

19:41.459 --> 19:43.326
Buddy system.

19:43.328 --> 19:45.795
So, uh, this is me.

19:45.797 --> 19:49.465
Ah, this is me.

19:49.467 --> 19:52.468
God, you're doing so amazing in class.

19:52.470 --> 19:54.036
You're killing it, Kevin.

19:54.038 --> 19:56.806
I'm really impressed.

19:56.808 --> 20:01.477
It's cold.

20:01.479 --> 20:03.479
I sweat a lot.

20:03.481 --> 20:07.482
I mean, not just in class,
but, like, right now.

20:07.484 --> 20:10.719
When I get home, sometimes I'm so
tired, I won't even take a shower.

20:10.721 --> 20:12.387
I just lay in my own filth.

20:12.389 --> 20:13.789
Wallet and car keys now.

20:13.791 --> 20:16.057
How are you supposed to drive two cars?

20:16.059 --> 20:16.491
Oh, my God.

20:19.396 --> 20:21.163
Kevin, finish him off!

20:21.165 --> 20:21.797
Do the Lever!

20:21.799 --> 20:25.033
I can do this: groin, elbow, groin...
What are you doing?!

20:25.035 --> 20:27.502
I'm doing the Lever, the
move that you do on me!

20:27.504 --> 20:28.503
I was hitting on you!

20:28.505 --> 20:30.004
What? I'm married.

20:30.006 --> 20:30.872
I'm married, too!

20:30.874 --> 20:32.207
Get off my crank, man!

20:32.209 --> 20:33.174
Okay, okay, you know what?

20:33.176 --> 20:35.509
You know what, I can't, I can't do this.
I'm sorry.

20:35.511 --> 20:36.343
Kevin!

20:36.345 --> 20:38.178
I'm just gonna back to Zumba at the Y.

20:38.180 --> 20:39.179
It's more my speed.

20:39.181 --> 20:42.182
But thank you so much for all
the material from my yank bank.

20:42.184 --> 20:43.016
Kevin!

20:43.018 --> 20:44.751
What are we gonna do with this?

20:44.753 --> 20:46.494
Get the (bleep) out of here!

20:46.614 --> 20:49.248
