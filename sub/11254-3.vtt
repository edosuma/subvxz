00:02.293 --> 00:03.503
- Hey, hey, everybody.
- Hey, Pastor.

00:03.586 --> 00:04.754
- Hey!
- Hey. How you doing?

00:04.838 --> 00:05.463
- Hey, Pastor, First Lady.
- Ooh!

00:05.547 --> 00:09.134
Lookin' good!

00:09.217 --> 00:11.344
- Did they charge by the inch?

00:13.012 --> 00:15.432
- Listen up, everybody.
Oh, good, you're here.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.100
{\an3}I have a questionnaire
for you to fill out.

00:17.183 --> 00:19.352
- Why are these guys
shorter than me?

00:19.436 --> 00:22.814
{\an3}- Our focus group said this was
the most relatable height.

00:22.897 --> 00:24.482
- Where was this focus group
from?

00:24.566 --> 00:26.359
Munchkinland?

00:26.443 --> 00:29.988
{\an3}- They also find your sarcasm
off-putting.

00:30.071 --> 00:32.073
{\an3}Now, if I'm going to run
this campaign effectively,

00:32.156 --> 00:36.244
{\an3}I need to know everything
about all of you.

00:36.327 --> 00:37.454
- Like what?

00:37.537 --> 00:38.955
- Anything
from any of your pasts

00:39.038 --> 00:40.915
that could embarrass
this campaign.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.126
{\an3}I am talking
brushes with the law,

00:43.209 --> 00:45.962
tax problems,
questionable associates...

00:46.045 --> 00:48.631
- I'm gonna need
some more paper.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.050
- Any sexual indiscretions.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.636
- Keep the paper a-coming.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.638
{\an3}- Look.
I have nothing to hide.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.307
- Pastor's an open book.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.975
He's the best man I know.

00:59.058 --> 01:00.769
- Oh, thank you, Merv.

01:00.852 --> 01:04.647
{\an3}I don't know about all that,
but he is right.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.817
{\an3}- So there's no chance there are
any pictures of your...

01:07.901 --> 01:09.986
{\an3}personal business
floating around out there?

01:10.069 --> 01:11.780
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:11.863 --> 01:15.575
{\an3}I keep my business
out the streets.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.327
{\an3}- Okay,
so then what's this?

01:17.410 --> 01:18.912
[both gasp]

01:18.995 --> 01:20.497
- Oh, my God.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.332
- Pastor, you nasty.

01:22.415 --> 01:25.877
- Hey, Shirley,
would you mind?

01:25.960 --> 01:27.045
{\an3}Shirley?

01:27.128 --> 01:28.880
Look, it was the '90s,
you know?

01:28.963 --> 01:29.964
I was on tour with Cameo then.

01:30.048 --> 01:34.093
{\an3}You know, we all had
the cups going...

01:34.177 --> 01:35.887
{\an3}- Boyce!

01:35.970 --> 01:37.388
This isn't you.

01:37.472 --> 01:38.848
- [sighs]
- Oh. Oh, good.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.517
Great. 'Cause I--
at first I thought

01:40.600 --> 01:42.352
{\an3}somebody caught me
getting out the pool.

01:42.435 --> 01:43.812
{\an3}That's...

01:43.895 --> 01:45.605
{\an3}- The point is
you weren't sure it wasn't,

01:45.688 --> 01:46.940
and that is a problem.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.150
{\an3}Now, if there is anything
like this out there,

01:49.234 --> 01:50.193
I need to know.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.319
- Look, Alicia--

01:51.402 --> 01:54.739
- Ah. It's Ah-lees-eya.

01:56.115 --> 01:57.951
- Boyce, why she got
her hand up?

01:58.034 --> 01:59.202
- Okay...
- Why?

01:59.285 --> 02:00.745
{\an1}- [murmuring]
Just keep them down.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.165
[mouthing] Hands down.
- Listen.

02:04.249 --> 02:08.086
You need to ratchet it down
a little bit, okay?

02:08.169 --> 02:09.795
I'ma ask you to chill.

02:09.878 --> 02:12.382
- Oh, I don't chill.
You chill, you lose.

02:12.465 --> 02:16.094
{\an3}When I am on a campaign,
I don't eat, I don't sleep.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.679
I just work.

02:17.762 --> 02:19.055
{\an3}The closest thing I've had
to a date

02:19.138 --> 02:20.056
in the last six months

02:20.139 --> 02:21.891
is when I printed this out.

02:21.975 --> 02:26.271
{\an3}- Okay. Would you mind
not pointing that thing at me?

02:26.354 --> 02:27.897
- Okay. Homophobic.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.691
That's not gonna help.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.245
{\an1}- Babe,
it's 3:00 in the morning.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.746
What are you doing?

02:43.830 --> 02:47.834
{\an9}- Hating you for buying
these little bite-sized cookies.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.878
{\an9}How many of these little cookies
you think it takes

02:49.961 --> 02:51.713
{\an8}to make one regular cookie?

02:51.796 --> 02:54.048
{\an8}I'm hoping 32.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.301
{\an8}- Okay. What's wrong?

02:56.384 --> 02:58.094
{\an9}- Okay, Boyce,
I might as well tell you,

02:58.177 --> 03:01.180
{\an9}'cause like Alicia said,
it's gonna come out eventually.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.140
{\an8}- Tell me what?

03:02.223 --> 03:04.809
{\an9}- Okay, Boyce,
you remember last spring

03:04.893 --> 03:08.479
{\an9}when me and the girls went
on that Chocolate Chick weekend?

03:08.563 --> 03:10.064
{\an8}- Yeah. I remember.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.025
{\an8}You came home all hungover.

03:12.108 --> 03:15.904
{\an7}Breath smelling like happy hour
and last call had a baby.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.365
{\an9}- Yeah. Yeah.
I had too much to drink.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.992
{\an8}together: Way too much--
- To drink.

03:21.075 --> 03:22.952
{\an8}I know. Okay, well,

03:23.036 --> 03:27.290
{\an9}a woman attacked me, Boyce,
and I got into a fight.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.208
{\an7}- Well, Lolli,
that's self-defense.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.044
{\an8}They can't blame you for that.

03:31.127 --> 03:33.588
{\an8}- Well...there's more.

03:33.671 --> 03:35.965
{\an8}I wound up on the floor,

03:36.049 --> 03:39.010
{\an9}and people started
taking pictures

03:39.093 --> 03:40.637
{\an8}'cause my booby popped out.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.556
{\an8}- Oh--oh! Which one?

03:43.640 --> 03:45.975
Laverne or Shirley?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.685
{\an3}- Laverne.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.315
{\an1}- Babe, are you--you sure
the pictures are out there?

03:52.398 --> 03:56.235
{\an3}- Boyce.
Cameras, these, the Internet.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.321
You know how these things go.

03:58.404 --> 03:58.905
- [sighs]

03:58.988 --> 04:00.990
So where are they?

04:01.074 --> 04:03.868
{\an3}- I don't know.
It's not like I go around

04:03.952 --> 04:06.955
{\an3}Googling my own naked boobies
on the Internet.

04:07.038 --> 04:09.624
{\an1}- This could be bad
for the campaign.

04:09.707 --> 04:10.959
We gonna have to call Alicia.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.835
- It's Ah-lees-eya.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.838
And don't bother.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.382
{\an3}I don't want to hear
her mouth.

04:17.464 --> 04:19.341
My chest, my mess.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.969
- Now you got me worried.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.887
- I'm sorry, babe.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.014
Here. Have a cookie.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.686
{\an1}- You know,
I'm gonna take one more.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.108
{\an3}- Pastor!

04:35.191 --> 04:37.944
{\an3}Welcome to your new
campaign headquarters.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.029
- Not bad.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.447
Hey, whoa, my man,

04:41.531 --> 04:43.866
{\an3}Are you about to throw
that satellite dish away?

04:43.950 --> 04:46.786
{\an1}- I'll sell it to you.
Deep discount.

04:46.869 --> 04:49.914
{\an3}- And I can get all the
NBA games if I put that up?

04:49.998 --> 04:52.208
{\an1}- Just got to call the satellite
company and open an account.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.711
{\an3}- But if I'm paying
the satellite company,

04:54.794 --> 04:57.338
{\an3}don't they give me
a satellite dish for free?

04:57.422 --> 04:59.424
{\an1}- They do.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.970
{\an3}- Okay, I can see
why you going out of business.

05:04.053 --> 05:05.263
{\an3}Go on.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.475
{\an1}- Pastor,
how you like the sign?

05:09.559 --> 05:11.436
- Ah, very nice.

05:11.519 --> 05:12.979
You know what, Mervin?

05:13.062 --> 05:14.647
Just one little thing.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.650
{\an3}Can you make sure
that the sign faces outside?

05:17.734 --> 05:21.529
I believe all the people inside
know it's headquarters already.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.698
{\an1}- [laughs]
Ha oh! My bad.

05:23.781 --> 05:26.075
{\an1}There you go,
thinking like a mayor.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.411
[both laughing]

05:28.494 --> 05:30.079
- I'll fix it after lunch.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.706
{\an3}- Well, if you--
okay.

05:31.789 --> 05:33.875
- Great news.
I just got confirmation

05:33.958 --> 05:37.128
{\an1}Channel 6 News will be here
interviewing you live.

05:37.211 --> 05:38.212
{\an3}- Really?
That's fantastic.

05:38.296 --> 05:41.883
{\an1}- Now, I combed over
your personal details,

05:41.966 --> 05:43.426
{\an1}and I need you to clean up
a few things

05:43.509 --> 05:45.344
{\an1}before they get out
and bite us.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.764
- Like what?
- Well, first,

05:47.847 --> 05:50.016
{\an1}I understand
Lolli has a fur coat.

05:50.099 --> 05:53.644
{\an3}- Oh, no,
that's not Lolli's.

05:53.728 --> 05:56.064
{\an1}- Well, then it definitely
needs to go.

05:56.147 --> 05:59.525
{\an1}And, uh, your employee
Mervin Brenningham?

05:59.609 --> 06:02.278
- Yeah, what about Merv?
- You need to fire him.

06:02.361 --> 06:03.488
- What? Why?

06:03.571 --> 06:05.073
- He has an arrest record.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.824
{\an3}- Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay.
You know what?

06:06.908 --> 06:08.701
{\an3}He did get
in a little trouble,

06:08.785 --> 06:11.412
{\an3}but he did community service,
and then he came to me

06:11.496 --> 06:14.290
{\an3}and he said,
"Pastor, I need your help."

06:14.373 --> 06:16.125
{\an3}And together we worked it out,
you know?

06:16.209 --> 06:20.421
{\an3}It is a really
inspiring story.

06:20.505 --> 06:23.091
- He was groping
women's behinds.

06:23.174 --> 06:26.803
{\an3}- Oh, it wasn't groping.
It was cupping.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.513
- I don't know what that is.

06:28.596 --> 06:29.972
- Well, cupping.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.183
{\an3}You know, well, as Mervin
explained it in court--

06:32.266 --> 06:33.976
{\an3}and the judge
saw the distinction here--

06:34.060 --> 06:37.563
Um, "groping" is groping.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.689
[makes growling sounds]

06:38.773 --> 06:41.776
- [mouthing words]
- But he was cupping,

06:41.859 --> 06:44.654
{\an3}which is bi--
no clenching involved.

06:44.737 --> 06:48.074
{\an3}And, uh, I'm still
not defending it, you know.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.201
{\an3}I'm just saying I'm gonna make
sure we acknowledge

06:50.284 --> 06:53.663
{\an3}his actual crime,
which was cupping, you know?

06:53.746 --> 06:58.084
{\an3}But the thing is, everybody
deserves a second chance, right?

06:58.167 --> 07:00.586
{\an1}- I can see you're
very passionate about this.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.380
- Thank you.
- Fire him.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.927
- Hey, Lolli!

07:08.010 --> 07:10.596
I got your text.
What's up?

07:10.680 --> 07:13.307
{\an3}- Stamps,
you watch tons of porn.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.726
{\an1}- Is this an intervention?
Because I've cut down.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.187
{\an3}- Listen.
I got a serious situation.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.899
{\an3}I need to find pictures
of boobies on the Internet,

07:21.983 --> 07:23.693
{\an3}and I don't know
where to look.

07:23.776 --> 07:24.902
- Where wouldn't you look?

07:24.986 --> 07:27.029
{\an1}I mean, the Internet
is 87% boobs.

07:27.113 --> 07:30.199
The other 13% is cats.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.201
{\an3}- Okay, I'm not just looking
for any boobs.

07:32.285 --> 07:37.123
{\an3}I'm...I'm looking for
a specific pair of breasts.

07:37.206 --> 07:38.541
{\an1}- Cool. What, exactly,
are you looking for?

07:38.624 --> 07:40.543
Big? Small?

07:40.626 --> 07:42.170
{\an1}Pierced? Lopsided?
Cross-eyed?

07:42.253 --> 07:46.048
{\an3}- No, Stamps!
I'm...

07:46.132 --> 07:49.677
{\an3}I'm looking for mine,
okay?

07:49.760 --> 07:50.970
{\an3}Look,

07:51.053 --> 07:53.347
{\an3}this cannot
leave this room.

07:53.431 --> 07:56.726
{\an3}There's a picture of my
loose boob on the Internet.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.686
I need to find it
and take it down

07:58.769 --> 08:01.147
{\an3}before it hurts
Boyce's campaign.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.107
[Stamps laughs]
- What?

08:03.191 --> 08:04.442
- Man, that's great.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.028
{\an1}I thought I'd be the one
to derail Boyce's campaign.

08:07.111 --> 08:08.404
{\an1}Ha-ha!

08:08.487 --> 08:10.406
- Will you help me?

08:10.489 --> 08:11.824
{\an1}- Okay, okay, look.
Let me just start

08:11.908 --> 08:12.909
with a basic image search.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.411
{\an1}All right,
give me some keywords.

08:15.494 --> 08:17.038
- Okay, uh...

08:17.121 --> 08:17.997
Chicago.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.499
Uh...chick fight.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.877
Bountiful.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.003
Uh...

08:24.086 --> 08:26.881
World's largest areola.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.094
{\an1}- All right.
Let's see what we got.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.138
{\an3}- Wait, wait!
Don't look!

08:34.222 --> 08:37.600
{\an1}- Well, if I can't look,
how am I gonna know it's you?

08:37.683 --> 08:40.311
{\an3}- Well--
well, just glance.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.233
{\an3}Why don't you just--
just squint?

08:45.316 --> 08:47.526
A-and blink.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.779
At the same time.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.239
{\an3}Squink!

08:51.322 --> 08:53.366
- I'm squinking.
Lolli, this hurts!

08:53.449 --> 08:54.909
{\an1}- Ugh.
[door slams]

08:54.992 --> 08:56.244
- Hi, babe.
- Hey, bro.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.787
- Hey, y'all.
What's going on?

08:57.870 --> 08:59.622
- Nothing.
Stamps is just helping me find

08:59.705 --> 09:01.707
a picture of my loose boob
on the Internet.

09:01.791 --> 09:05.044
{\an3}- Y'all check
"world's largest areola"?

09:07.171 --> 09:09.465
together: Something's wrong.

09:09.548 --> 09:12.301
- Boyce?

09:12.385 --> 09:13.803
What's wrong?

09:13.886 --> 09:15.805
{\an3}- Babe, you know Mervin
from the office?

09:15.888 --> 09:18.474
- Yeah. Merv the Perv.

09:18.557 --> 09:21.519
- Merv the Reformed Perv.

09:21.602 --> 09:25.648
Alicia wants me to fire him.
Said he can hurt my campaign.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.943
{\an1}- Well, that makes sense.
You should can him.

09:29.026 --> 09:31.445
- Babe.
But he's a new man.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.614
{\an1}You know, I'm not condoning
what he did,

09:33.698 --> 09:35.950
{\an1}but is he gonna
have to pay for it forever?

09:36.033 --> 09:37.994
{\an3}- You're right.
You got to keep him.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.662
{\an1}- [exhales]
But if I keep him,

09:39.745 --> 09:41.205
{\an1}then he could cost me
the election.

09:41.289 --> 09:44.000
{\an1}[scoffs/laughs]
Then that's helping nobody.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.168
- Boom. Sacrificial lamb.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.004
Get him out of there.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.548
- You know what?
To heck with it.

09:50.631 --> 09:51.924
Merv put his faith in me,

09:52.008 --> 09:53.676
{\an1}and I can't betray him
like that.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.220
{\an1}I'd rather lose this election
being myself

09:56.304 --> 09:58.472
{\an1}than to win
being somebody I'm not.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.350
You feel me, babe?

10:01.434 --> 10:02.768
{\an1}Babe?

10:02.852 --> 10:03.894
Lolli? Lolli!

10:03.978 --> 10:05.813
{\an3}- Huh?
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:05.896 --> 10:09.275
{\an3}I just thought of a new keyword
for my image search.

10:09.358 --> 10:10.359
{\an3}Stamps!

10:10.443 --> 10:12.778
Google "chocolate heaven"!

10:16.782 --> 10:17.825
- Can you excuse us?

10:17.908 --> 10:19.243
{\an3}- Okay,
don't go too far.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.578
I don't want to be shiny.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.121
- Boyce, listen to me.

10:22.204 --> 10:24.206
This Mervin thing
is gonna come out,

10:24.290 --> 10:26.250
{\an1}blow up in your face,
and bite you in the ass.

10:26.334 --> 10:29.337
- My face and my ass?

10:30.963 --> 10:35.092
When they find out you have
a deviant on your payroll,

10:35.176 --> 10:36.927
{\an3}you are gonna spend
the rest of this campaign

10:37.011 --> 10:39.138
on the defensive.
- Well, you know what?

10:39.221 --> 10:41.057
Then I'll just go
on the offensive.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.892
{\an1}Look, I've been
a public figure for years.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.978
{\an1}I think I know a thing or two
about handling the press.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.646
{\an1}The bottom line: I'm not
turning my back on Mervin.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.941
{\an3}- No one should turn their back
on Mervin.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.902
- He's reformed!

10:52.985 --> 10:55.029
He's reformed.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.823
- Lolli, I can't find them.

10:57.907 --> 10:58.866
- Stamps, come on.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.659
{\an1}They gotta be out there
somewhere.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.579
- I'm telling you, I've searched
every site I can think of.

11:03.662 --> 11:06.499
I even went to
"Big-ol'-jigglies-dot-com."

11:06.582 --> 11:08.876
{\an3}- Did you go to
"Big-ol'-jigglies-dot-net"?

11:08.959 --> 11:09.960
- Yes.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.754
{\an3}Dot-org?

11:11.837 --> 11:13.464
- Lolli, please.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.883
{\an1}I've looked at thousands
of pictures of women's breasts,

11:15.966 --> 11:17.802
and I never thought I'd say
this, but I'm hootered out.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.680
{\an3}- Stamps,
let's just be clear.

11:21.764 --> 11:24.100
{\an3}I got to find those pictures
and get them taken down.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.936
Permanently.
- I do know a guy.

11:27.019 --> 11:30.898
{\an1}Someone who can comb
the far reaches of the Deep Web.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.149
But it's gonna cost you.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.860
{\an3}- Well, okay, Stamps.
Money is no object.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.779
{\an3}Not when it comes to
Boyce's campaign.

11:36.862 --> 11:40.032
{\an1}- All right.
I'm reaching out to The Wolf.

11:40.116 --> 11:43.494
{\an3}- What kind of stupid name
is The Wolf?

11:43.577 --> 11:45.162
{\an8}<i>- I'm Megan Farrington,</i>

11:45.246 --> 11:47.957
{\an8}<i>and I'm here today</i>
<i>with Pastor Boyce Ballentine.</i>

11:48.040 --> 11:50.126
- Ooh, my baby's on TV!

11:50.209 --> 11:52.128
{\an3}<i>- Thank you, Megan.</i>
<i>I appreciate your time.</i>

11:52.211 --> 11:54.130
{\an1}- Now, you've been
many things in your life,

11:54.213 --> 11:56.799
from Boyce the Voice
to Boyce the Pastor.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.301
{\an3}<i>- I believe you're forgetting</i>
<i>that brief reggae phase</i>

11:59.385 --> 12:02.054

12:08.894 --> 12:10.146
{\an3}Watch me!

12:11.689 --> 12:13.607
<i>- So, now, Reverend,</i>
<i>you want to be mayor?</i>

12:13.691 --> 12:14.650
<i>What prompted you</i>
<i>to get into this race?</i>

12:14.733 --> 12:18.320
<i>- Well, Megan,</i>
<i>I love St. Louis.</i>

12:18.404 --> 12:19.655
<i>But we have lost</i>
<i>our priorities.</i>

12:19.738 --> 12:22.741
<i>The city is balancing</i>

12:22.825 --> 12:25.327
<i>on the backs of the little guy,</i>

12:25.411 --> 12:28.289
- You tell 'em, baby!

12:28.372 --> 12:30.249
{\an1}- You're going up against
Mayor Ron Saxby,

12:30.332 --> 12:32.418
{\an1}who has years of experience
in government.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.753
{\an1}Now, you've never held
public office in your life.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.797
<i>- Well, Mayor Saxby</i>
<i>has years of experience</i>

12:36.881 --> 12:39.717
<i>saying one thing</i>
<i>and doing another.</i>

12:39.800 --> 12:41.135
<i>Now, I'm not a politician.</i>
<i>I won't abandon</i>

12:41.218 --> 12:45.639
<i>what I stand for just to</i>
<i>score some political points,</i>

12:45.723 --> 12:47.933
<i>even though some people</i>
<i>on my own campaign</i>

12:48.017 --> 12:49.852
<i>urge me to do just that.</i>

12:49.935 --> 12:51.020
- Can you give us an example?

12:51.103 --> 12:52.563
- Well, sure.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.524
{\an3}For one, there is a guy
who works for me

12:55.608 --> 12:57.026
{\an3}that a while back got in
a little trouble with the law.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.945
<i>Now, if I were playing</i>
<i>politics, I would fire that man</i>

13:00.029 --> 13:03.491
<i>before the press</i>
<i>could use it against me.</i>

13:03.574 --> 13:04.950
<i>But I don't play that game.</i>

13:05.034 --> 13:08.162
<i>People are more important</i>
<i>than politics.</i>

13:08.245 --> 13:10.080
- Who is this man?

13:10.164 --> 13:13.626
{\an3}- Just a man who needed
a second chance.

13:13.709 --> 13:17.046
- Wonder who he's talking about.
- You got me.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.672
Probably no one we know.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.716
[nervous laugh]

13:20.799 --> 13:23.010
{\an3}- When you ask
the citizens of St. Louis

13:23.093 --> 13:25.137
{\an3}what it is that they want
to talk about,

13:25.221 --> 13:26.597
it'll be three points.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.849
{\an1}- Is the man you're referring to
Mervin Brenningham?

13:28.933 --> 13:30.976
- Uh, say what, now?

13:31.060 --> 13:32.603
<i>- What, exactly,</i>
<i>did Mr. Brenningham do?</i>

13:32.686 --> 13:36.232
{\an3}- What he did
was change his life.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.650
You can't always--
- Was Mr. Brenningham charged

13:37.733 --> 13:40.694
{\an1}with multiple counts
of lewd conduct?

13:40.778 --> 13:43.072
{\an3}- Why isn't St. Louis
in the running

13:43.155 --> 13:45.282
for the 2024 Summer Olympics?

13:45.366 --> 13:47.409
I am glad you asked me that.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.537
- I didn't ask that.
- Would you? Please?

13:49.620 --> 13:52.289
{\an1}- Mr. Brenningham allegedly
groped the buttocks

13:52.373 --> 13:54.500
of multiple women in public.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.628
{\an3}- Okay, how many pieces of paper
does this guy have?

13:57.711 --> 13:59.255
{\an1}- Reverend Ballentine,
we need to know--

13:59.338 --> 14:01.757
- Okay, it wasn't groping.

14:01.840 --> 14:02.716
It was cupping.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.927
- [mouthing words]
- Cupping?

14:05.010 --> 14:08.556
- Sure. There is a fine
distinction here.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.433
{\an3}- No, no, no, Boyce,
don't go there, don't go there!

14:11.517 --> 14:13.978
{\an3}- "Groping" is groping.
Everybody like, "Ah, ooh!

14:14.061 --> 14:15.354
What you doing?"

14:15.437 --> 14:19.733
{\an3}But "cupping"
is more of a contouring,

14:19.817 --> 14:21.110
if you will.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.611
{\an1}- [mouthing words] Stop,
please, for the love of God--

14:22.695 --> 14:26.907
{\an3}- What I'm trying to say is that
this is about forgiveness.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.200
- I had no idea

14:28.284 --> 14:31.662
{\an1}there was a stone-cold
freak among us.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.205
{\an1}So...

14:33.289 --> 14:33.998
{\an1}what's up?

14:37.209 --> 14:38.127
- What we need to remember here

14:38.210 --> 14:41.714
{\an3}is that this is about
forgiveness.

14:41.797 --> 14:44.717
Like the Bible says,
turn the other cheek.

14:46.093 --> 14:46.885
I knew that was a bad quote

14:46.969 --> 14:50.472
as it was coming
out of my mouth.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.058
- Now, Lolli,

14:53.142 --> 14:54.184
are you sure you're up
for this?

14:54.268 --> 14:55.477
- You saw Boyce
on television.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.813
{\an1}He can't afford
another disaster.

14:57.896 --> 14:59.398
- Don't worry, all right?

14:59.481 --> 15:00.566
{\an3}If your pictures
are on the Internet,

15:00.649 --> 15:01.483
The Wolf will find them.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.360
{\an1}- Well, let's get this
over with.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.696
{\an1}This place is making me
start to itch.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.160
- Lolli,

15:11.243 --> 15:13.037
this is The Wolf.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.457
- 'Sup?

15:16.540 --> 15:18.000
{\an1}- Curtis?

15:18.083 --> 15:21.128
{\an1}That's no damn wolf.
That's your weed dealer!

15:22.588 --> 15:27.009
{\an3}- Lolli, I couldn't afford
all this off one hustle.

15:27.092 --> 15:30.512
{\an3}I'm also doing taxes now.
Y'all good on taxes?

15:30.596 --> 15:32.014
- Brah, I've been meaning
to ask you--

15:32.097 --> 15:34.850
{\an3}Can I write off shoes
as transportation?

15:34.933 --> 15:37.811
- Yeah, you're good.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.147
{\an1}- Can we get back
to my problem?

15:40.230 --> 15:42.983
{\an3}- Lolli, relax. If your booby's
floating around out there,

15:43.067 --> 15:45.069
{\an3}I'll find it,
and I'll rub it out.

15:46.528 --> 15:47.863
- Excuse me?

15:47.946 --> 15:50.199
- No, h-he means erase it.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.910
{\an3}- But it'll cost you.
2 Gs.

15:52.993 --> 15:54.328
{\an1}- 2,000?

15:54.411 --> 15:57.331
You ain't Olivia Pope!

15:57.414 --> 15:59.333
I'll give you $75.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.795
- All right, then.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.213
But I want it in all 1s.

16:04.296 --> 16:07.549
{\an3}I'm gonna hit the strip club
after this.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.759
Sit down.

16:08.842 --> 16:11.387
{\an3}- Okay.
What are we doing?

16:11.470 --> 16:13.931
- I'm gonna run
a facial recognition search.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.392
I need a picture of you making
the same face you were making

16:16.475 --> 16:17.851
the moments
the pictures was taken.

16:17.935 --> 16:21.021
{\an3}- O-okay, well,
this ratchet punched me,

16:21.105 --> 16:23.148
{\an3}and then all hell
broke loose,

16:23.232 --> 16:24.525
I went down...

16:24.608 --> 16:26.360
{\an3}[shrilly]
aah...

16:26.443 --> 16:28.320
and Laverne popped out.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.908
- Got it.

16:32.991 --> 16:34.576
Now, we could
cut the search time in half

16:34.660 --> 16:36.161
if I had a picture of your--

16:36.245 --> 16:38.789
{\an3}- Curtis, don't make me
slap the black off of you.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.252
- Congratulations, Boyce.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.003
I think you locked up
the grab-ass vote.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.925
- Look. I'm not saying
it was my greatest triumph.

16:50.008 --> 16:53.178
{\an3}- Well, at least
we all learned something.

16:53.262 --> 16:56.098
{\an3}You have got to listen
to me.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.183
- No. Actually,

16:58.267 --> 17:00.436
{\an3}you have got to listen
to me.

17:00.519 --> 17:01.937
- Excuse me?
- I told you from day one

17:02.020 --> 17:04.606
{\an3}what kind of candidate
I was gonna be.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.691
You work for me.

17:05.773 --> 17:07.943
{\an3}It's your job
to figure me out.

17:08.026 --> 17:09.653
- You're right.

17:09.737 --> 17:10.404
{\an3}- Uh--what?

17:10.487 --> 17:12.781
{\an3}Really?

17:12.865 --> 17:15.742
I was expecting to have
a big fight over this.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.704
{\an1}- In my business, you gotta
work with what you got.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.497
{\an1}You know that honesty
of yours...

17:20.580 --> 17:24.710
is really irritating.

17:24.792 --> 17:26.336
{\an3}- Well, trust me.
You're gonna find out

17:26.420 --> 17:28.964
there are a lot of people
who appreciate my honesty.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.383
{\an3}Merv, how you doing,
my brother?

17:31.467 --> 17:33.093
{\an1}- I'm not your brother,
Mayor McSnitch.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.891
{\an3}- Look, Merv, I'm sorry
that stuff got out there.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.392
That was not my intention.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.061
{\an3}But in my defense:
I took a stand for you.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.063
- It would've been better
if you had just fired me.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.732
{\an1}Then my wife
wouldn't have found out.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.067
- Your wife didn't know?
- Hell, no!

17:49.151 --> 17:50.527
{\an1}You think I'm gonna put
"booty cupper"

17:50.611 --> 17:52.154
on my Christian Mingle?

17:54.239 --> 17:55.949
{\an3}- Well, Merv, look.
We can work this out.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.618
- No, we can't.

17:57.701 --> 17:59.286
{\an1}I quit.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.455
{\an3}- Mervin.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.123
Oh, you just taking that?

18:03.207 --> 18:04.666
{\an1}- It's called severance,
bitch.

18:07.294 --> 18:08.796
- Well, joke's on him,

18:08.879 --> 18:10.506
{\an1}'cause he's still got to call
the satellite company

18:10.589 --> 18:12.216
to hook that thing up.

18:12.299 --> 18:15.594
And now he don't have a job.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.640
- I can only order Taco Bell,

18:19.723 --> 18:22.142
so let's not put
I speak Spanish on there.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.897
- Boyce, I got good news.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.106
- What's up, babe?

18:28.190 --> 18:32.110
{\an1}- My boob is not on the Internet
anywhere.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.238
- Well, that's great.
- Yeah, just great.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.991
{\an1}- Okay, what's wrong,
Lolli?

18:38.075 --> 18:42.287
{\an3}- What's wrong is that my boob
is not on the Internet anywhere!

18:42.371 --> 18:44.289
Nobody posted it!

18:44.373 --> 18:45.541
My naked body!

18:45.624 --> 18:47.793
- Aww.
- The party's over.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.253
{\an1}- Ohh...
The party's not over.

18:49.336 --> 18:53.298
{\an1}You know I'll always be a fan
of Laverne and Shirley.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.050
{\an3}- Aww.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.218
- I don't mean to pry,

18:56.301 --> 18:58.178
but is there something
I need to know about?

18:58.262 --> 19:01.431
{\an3}- No, there's nothing you need
to know about, Ah-lees-ya.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.559
- Okay.

19:03.642 --> 19:04.893
Lolli had reason to believe

19:04.977 --> 19:07.729
she had some compromising
pictures on the Internet,

19:07.813 --> 19:09.815
but it turned out
to be a false alarm.

19:09.898 --> 19:12.109
{\an1}- Are you talking about Lolli
on the floor of a club,

19:12.192 --> 19:14.695
top down, one boob out?

19:14.778 --> 19:18.657
- Yes!
- I got rid of those days ago.

19:18.740 --> 19:19.700
- What are you saying?

19:19.783 --> 19:23.036
{\an1}- Lolli, when I met you,
I said to myself,

19:23.120 --> 19:25.956
{\an1}"This is a woman
with tit pics on the Internet."

19:27.165 --> 19:30.168
{\an1}I had my cyber guys
scrub them.

19:30.252 --> 19:34.047
{\an1}It cost a fortune.
Those pics were everywhere.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.883
together: Everywhere?

19:35.966 --> 19:37.467
- Did you hear that, Boyce?

19:37.551 --> 19:40.262
I still got it!
Ah-ha-ha!

19:40.345 --> 19:41.430
- Lolli--Laverne, Laverne!

19:41.513 --> 19:43.307
- Ooh.
