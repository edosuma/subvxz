00:01.080 --> 00:02.809
<i>Previously on Hit the Floor:</i>

00:02.960 --> 00:05.406
You've noticed
he's never far from a glass.

00:05.520 --> 00:06.851
You have a child?

00:06.960 --> 00:09.611
When you went to pick up my son,
were you drinking?

00:09.720 --> 00:13.361
Word on the street is you like
to keep track of high rollers.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.608
These guys are as high up as it gets.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.207
I wanna know
if those files prove anything.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.651
I'm gonna help you.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.882
Raquel, Oscar has a burner phone.

00:22.040 --> 00:25.203
We could go after that phone.
That could have everything.

00:25.320 --> 00:27.084
- Wrong Hayes.
- Mama Bear?

00:27.240 --> 00:29.208
Everyone knows
she had a wild past.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.089
I wanna know how wild it got.

00:31.480 --> 00:34.051
I know what you want, Jelena.
You could be happy.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.650
I'm not your problem.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.804
We were each big prizes
the other bagged, nothing more.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.447
Whatever your deal is, grow up.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.006
- Stop taking it out on everybody else.
- Hey!

00:47.120 --> 00:49.202
- What is that?
- I'll explain later.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.567
Ma'am, step out of the car.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.604
Shoes.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.001
- Sorry?
- Remove your shoes.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.161
Your earrings and that ring.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.044
The belt.

01:43.280 --> 01:45.726
Ahsha, it's me, again.

01:45.880 --> 01:47.689
Call me back.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.565
Everyone saw that picture.
She must've heard by now.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.610
Or she's with Derek
and they haven't heard a thing.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.481
Come into work.
It's not as bad as you think.

01:58.640 --> 02:02.087
Raquel, someone took a picture of it.
It's online, I'm online.

02:02.240 --> 02:05.881
Naked, with a rubber strap
tied around my arm.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.964
I can't stop seeing it in my head.

02:10.240 --> 02:13.449
That's all everyone's gonna see
when they look at me.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.521
It'll blow over.

02:21.360 --> 02:24.489
We need to get Oscar's
burner phone number.

02:25.280 --> 02:28.204
- How?
- Jude might have it.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.211
He asked me out once.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.567
Maybe I can get him
to ask me out again.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.370
Sneak a look?

02:39.920 --> 02:42.446
I'm so sorry, Sloane.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.928
Where did that picture
even come from?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.321
I have an idea.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.649
The Devil Girls would be delighted
to perform at your party.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.802
She's not in a position to say no.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.611
Great. We'll be there.

03:03.240 --> 03:06.289
- What are you doing in here?
- Cleaning up Sloane's mess.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.961
We lost bookings thanks to her
photo shoot from the set of The Wire.

03:11.080 --> 03:14.971
Lucky for us, I just hooked a whale
that'll more than make up for it.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.768
- Why are you here?
- Looking for you.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.486
- My buddy Vance is back in town.
- Vance.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.768
Your one college friend
I actually like.

03:22.880 --> 03:26.009
We're getting together for lunch.
You wanna come?

03:26.840 --> 03:29.286
- You want me there?
- Vance does.

03:30.560 --> 03:33.166
Actually, I'd enjoy having lunch.

03:33.320 --> 03:35.209
With Vance.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.010
I'll let him know.

03:44.720 --> 03:48.327
You even make breakfast sexy.
I'm glad fate brought us together.

03:48.480 --> 03:52.929
Yeah. Fate has a way
of making things happen

03:53.040 --> 03:54.963
like maybe
a flight somewhere exotic?

03:55.080 --> 03:57.845
Well, I have to be in Dubai
first thing tomorrow.

03:58.440 --> 04:02.968
Perfect. Think of the things we can do
on top of the world's tallest building.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.966
Next time.
This trip's strictly business.

04:06.120 --> 04:10.682
But I arranged a gift
for you to enjoy while I'm gone.

04:10.840 --> 04:14.606
- It's on the way up now.
- You know I love presents.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.211
I think he forgot it.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.691
Actually, he is it.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.330
Your very own personal valet

04:28.480 --> 04:31.802
to cater to your every whim
while I'm away.

04:31.960 --> 04:34.008
Kyle, Wendall.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.810
You're kidding.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.568
- He's kidding, right?
- No, ma'am.

04:46.240 --> 04:49.403
Were you as turned on by that
whole photo thing as I was?

04:52.280 --> 04:55.045
Of course you were.
So is she out or what?

04:55.200 --> 04:58.488
Or what.
I just saw Oscar, he refuses to fire her.

04:59.320 --> 05:02.449
Something about standing by family,
blah, blah, blah.

05:02.920 --> 05:04.763
Since when is Oscar a family man?

05:04.920 --> 05:08.322
Since he made a big public point
of hiring Sloane.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.727
Letting her go
would be admitting a mistake.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.571
This way he gets to be loyal
and noble.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.011
Sorry it didn't work out.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.527
Who said it didn't?

05:18.760 --> 05:20.489
The damage is done.

05:20.640 --> 05:24.167
Just because Sloane can come back
doesn't mean she will.

05:30.040 --> 05:33.886
Hey. Look, Ahsha, I'm sorry.
Come on, let me drive you home.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.963
I'm not getting in that car
with you.

05:36.120 --> 05:40.489
- Look, I know I messed up.
- I just spent the night in jail.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.847
This is way beyond messed up.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.925
You were in a holding room.
I signed autographs, I took care of it.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.082
Getting frisked,
thrown in a police car

05:49.200 --> 05:53.091
forced to hand over shoes, locked
in a room, that's you taking care of it?

05:53.200 --> 05:56.921
No, I got you off with a warning.
Nothing's on your record.

05:57.040 --> 06:00.726
- It's like it never happened.
- But it did happen, Derek.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.281
Your cocaine ended up in my bag.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.280
I wondered
how far your partying went.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.771
Now I know.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.285
Look, Ahsha.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.168
Hey, coach.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.769
Coach.

06:31.480 --> 06:32.925
What time is it?

06:33.080 --> 06:35.481
We've got practise,
the guys are on the court.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.210
Okay.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.930
All right.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.570
I'm gonna get changed,
I'm good to go.

06:46.040 --> 06:49.647
- I don't think you should.
- German, I got this.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.442
The top running back in football

06:55.600 --> 06:59.286
over 10,000 total yards gained,
over 2000 carries

06:59.440 --> 07:01.966
and my face
is on your nephew's wall.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.526
Four-time All-Star,
two-time scoring champion--

07:04.640 --> 07:06.881
And still no championship.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.761
Boys, if you're gonna spend this time
stroking your stats, I'm leaving.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.570
This is why I love this girl.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.082
Okay, Vance, your two titles and MVP
puts you in the lead

07:16.240 --> 07:19.767
but I'm getting a ring this year,
and you're retired now

07:19.920 --> 07:23.402
so it's only a matter of time
before I lap you. Oh, yeah.

07:23.840 --> 07:27.526
So I did spend some time
on the sidelines last season.

07:27.680 --> 07:31.401
I'm hardly retired.
And if you're gonna get that ring

07:31.520 --> 07:34.285
you can't choke against Miami
like you did last year.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.683
Miami?

07:37.120 --> 07:39.202
That was three years ago.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.567
How do you stay
with this chucklehead

07:45.720 --> 07:48.405
with him needing to be right
all the time?

07:48.600 --> 07:50.921
I mean, this is crazy.

07:51.080 --> 07:52.411
Vance, you okay?

07:56.480 --> 07:58.369
I gotta cut out.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.486
L-- But I wanna meet up
tomorrow night.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.405
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.324
- Okay.
- Bye.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.801
- Good seeing you again.
- Good to see you.

08:08.640 --> 08:09.971
- My man.
- My man.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.764
- I got it, I got--
- I got this.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.451
I will always be faster than you.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.808
I'll see y'all tomorrow.

08:19.280 --> 08:22.090
Didn't you tell him we broke up?

08:22.240 --> 08:23.969
I told him.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.689
He knows Miami
was three years ago.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.643
He sure as hell knows he's retired.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.885
Something is definitely wrong.

08:35.559 --> 08:37.688
Thanks for getting here so fast.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.207
What the hell happened?

08:43.600 --> 08:46.649
I'll cover at practise.
I'll say he got sick or something.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.125
Thanks.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.124
<i>Hey-</i>

08:58.000 --> 09:00.241
You don't look so good.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.251
- What's going on?
- You first.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.249
Last night was a mess.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.324
My whole life is a mess.

09:13.440 --> 09:16.284
I was with Raquel, now I'm not.

09:17.320 --> 09:21.882
I'm in the middle of a divorce
with no end in sight.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.607
I can't even talk to your mom.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.211
I just wanna tell her it's okay.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.362
She shouldn't be ashamed.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.644
Ashamed about what?

09:35.200 --> 09:36.531
The roast.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.768
Why would she be ashamed
about the roast?

09:40.840 --> 09:43.127
You left early.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.929
Ahsha,

09:46.600 --> 09:48.568
it was terrible.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.844
There was a slideshow.

09:54.760 --> 09:59.084
And then they put this old photo up
of your mom.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.487
She was naked.

10:02.640 --> 10:06.486
- Her arm was tied.
- Oh, my God.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.365
We need to talk.

10:09.480 --> 10:12.370
What were you thinking
getting into a fight with Derek?

10:12.480 --> 10:15.404
- He was out of control.
- This is me you're talking to.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.409
Derek's a client at my agency too.

10:17.560 --> 10:21.485
You need to be more careful
or I have to deal with the blowback.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.610
You and I came into this with a plan.
Trust it.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.445
Just be careful. I risked a lot for you.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.251
Relax. I got you.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.768
You okay? You look a little tense.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.490
I've had better days.

10:43.640 --> 10:47.008
Well, speaking of better days,
I was hoping we could have lunch.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.604
- Really?
- How about tomorrow? You and me.

10:51.680 --> 10:55.730
- Like a date?
- Well, I'm not dating Pete anymore.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.689
Why not, right?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.606
I'll make us a reservation
at Arianna's.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.730
What the hell?

11:05.880 --> 11:07.769
And who let this creepster in here?

11:07.880 --> 11:10.770
That's no creepster, that's Wendall,
my personal valet.

11:11.200 --> 11:14.090
On loan from a friend.
Don't worry, I'm sure he's gay.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.804
<i>_ “m _
- Ream]?</i>

11:15.960 --> 11:17.962
Then why are you dressed like that?

11:18.360 --> 11:21.603
Oh, he adds lilac to everything.
I can't stop him.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.331
Whatever y'all want,
Wendall will make it happen.

11:24.440 --> 11:27.922
Mani-pedi, facial, Swedish massage,
Brazilian waxing--

11:28.040 --> 11:30.441
I've only been told
to give you what you want.

11:31.080 --> 11:34.766
What I want is for you
to get everyone what they want.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.651
Yes, Miss Hart.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.769
Ahsha.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.729
I only just heard about the picture.

11:55.960 --> 11:58.122
Where have you been, honey?

11:59.920 --> 12:01.445
Pete.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.365
I was at his office all day.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.284
Nursing his hangover.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.090
Hangover?

12:14.640 --> 12:18.122
He was a mess. Still drunk,
still in his clothes from the roast.

12:18.280 --> 12:22.285
- I've never seen him like that.
- I was afraid of this.

12:22.560 --> 12:24.801
- It's happening again.
- What's happening?

12:25.640 --> 12:27.802
An old pattern.

12:27.960 --> 12:31.646
He goes from getting drunk at parties
to drinking alone.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.564
And then it bleeds into the day.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.324
He starts missing practises.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.801
He missed a practise today.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.602
- What do we do?
- We don't do anything.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.730
You can't fix him, Ahsha. I tried.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.644
It almost destroyed me.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.323
Maybe it's your fear talking.

12:49.480 --> 12:51.323
Maybe it was a one-time thing.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.006
This isn't the end of something.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.606
It's the start of something.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.768
Something you don't wanna
be a part of.

13:11.920 --> 13:14.446
- Stop calling me.
- Answering helps that.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.722
- I don't wanna talk.
- I need to see you.

13:16.840 --> 13:20.526
- Meet me at the Farmers Market--
- I'm not close to ready to see you.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.881
- Want some coffee?
- You're at your mom's?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.684
<i>Not anymore.</i>

13:34.680 --> 13:36.011
Is that the picture?

13:37.760 --> 13:39.091
That's not you.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.128
It is me.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.921
Just because some time has passed
doesn't change that.

13:46.080 --> 13:49.721
That picture represents
the decisions I made.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.770
This is what happens
when you give up on yourself.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.605
- Who you wanna be.
- You can't give up now.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.443
- Ahsha.
- You know Jelena did it.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.771
I know.

14:00.880 --> 14:04.123
You didn't go in to work yesterday.
You're still in your robe.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.408
Ahsha, this is what's out there.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.242
You can't let her get away with it.

14:11.400 --> 14:14.210
You didn't do anything wrong.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.325
I have to go.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.211
We're dancing at a private party
at Hotel Figueroa.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.603
- Some investment banker billionaire.
- Dev Paes?

14:24.720 --> 14:28.520
That guy bilked people out of millions.
I turned him down three times.

14:28.680 --> 14:32.765
Well, you weren't there for the fourth.
If you won't fight Jelena, I will.

14:32.880 --> 14:35.645
- Don't need anyone to fight.
- See you at the arena.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.449
Derek Roman.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.368
I saw you here before,
but I was too nervous to say hi.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.010
I'm sorry about your friend.

14:46.120 --> 14:49.249
- My friend?
- The blonde lady who died?

14:49.360 --> 14:50.805
The one you were here with.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.409
No, no. That wasn't me.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.040
It had to be a couple of months ago
because I--

14:56.200 --> 14:59.488
Sorry. It's always nice to meet a fan.

15:05.120 --> 15:08.169
- Hey.
- I'm almost done with this report.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.651
Not why I'm here.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.451
I wanted to thank you
for having my back yesterday.

15:13.600 --> 15:17.571
- No problem.
- Well, it's not gonna happen again.

15:17.720 --> 15:22.487
Let's chalk it up to an epic disaster
of a night and leave it at that, okay?

15:22.640 --> 15:25.211
- Sure.
- All right.

15:25.360 --> 15:28.011
As a token of my appreciation,

15:28.120 --> 15:31.010
how would you like to go to the
Western Coaches Dinner?

15:31.160 --> 15:32.685
That's only for head coaches.

15:32.840 --> 15:36.367
I'll tell them that you're there
taking notes for me. Okay? You in?

15:36.520 --> 15:39.000
- Hell, yeah.
- All right, 8:00.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.481
I spoke to Vance's dad.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.130
- And?
- He has something called CTE.

15:56.040 --> 15:59.931
It's degenerative.
Comes with memory loss,

16:00.080 --> 16:02.686
depression, dementia.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.922
Sometimes he even forgets he has it.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.202
He got it playing ball.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.161
He had 15 serious concussions.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.650
It's brain damage.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.204
When you get knocked down,
you get back up.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.891
But at a certain point--

16:34.040 --> 16:35.849
He was building a legacy.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.128
It's a steep price to pay.

16:40.480 --> 16:42.448
When we see him,
we can't bring it up.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.287
It upsets him and...

16:48.440 --> 16:51.284
I don't know
how I'm gonna handle this.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.603
But I need your help.

16:58.360 --> 17:00.089
What's so important?

17:01.480 --> 17:04.768
I don't need that courtside seat.
I've come to my last game.

17:05.560 --> 17:07.847
What are you talking about?
You're our girl.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.964
- You're Oscar's girl.
- I'm nobody's girl.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.406
We both know
I was never doing it for Oscar.

17:13.560 --> 17:17.484
Or for you or my movie.
I'm tired of chasing.

17:17.920 --> 17:20.810
Tired of pretending
I can have what I want.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.883
So I'm saying goodbye to the Devils.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.127
The games, the parties, press.
I'm out.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.645
You can't back out.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.325
We made an agreement.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.131
Look, you're the best press
Oscar's getting.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.521
He's gonna be pissed. Pissed at me.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.084
You'll live.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.325
Let's go, man.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.283
- All right.
- Don't worry about it.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.164
Take care of yourself, all right?

17:46.280 --> 17:47.611
Trust me.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.410
I should hope so.
I'm not spending a grand on orchids

18:39.520 --> 18:41.682
to make her feel unimpressed.

18:42.520 --> 18:45.251
I said exotic, not tropical.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.370
She's Lionel Davenport
for Christ's sake.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.490
What?

18:52.960 --> 18:56.567
You invite one girl out to lunch
where you order flowers for another?

18:56.680 --> 19:00.924
- Got to be some rule against that.
- I'm doing this for Oscar.

19:01.520 --> 19:04.490
- You go out of your way a lot for him.
- I guess.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.642
You have any pics of you two?

19:07.400 --> 19:09.926
- Of me and Lionel?
- Of you and Oscar.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.884
Funny.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.244
Oh, you were serious?

19:15.400 --> 19:18.722
You really don't have
any kind of relationship at all?

19:18.880 --> 19:20.962
Every relationship is different,
Raquel.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.371
Knowing I'm earning
my father's respect

19:24.520 --> 19:28.366
and that it wasn't just gifted to me
as a child proves it's genuine.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.091
It's getting chilly.
I left my sweater in your car.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.726
- Would you mind grabbing it for me?
- Sure.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.161
Michael. It's Sloane.

20:22.320 --> 20:26.166
Listen, I know there's no case
anymore, but...

20:26.320 --> 20:29.403
Well, I was hoping
you could do something for me.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.241
Can you run a phone number?

20:41.360 --> 20:42.805
You shouldn't have come.

20:42.960 --> 20:45.884
- I just wanna talk.
- I want you to stop bulldozing me.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.923
If I don't, we're never gonna talk.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.731
If you keep pushing me, we won't.

20:51.920 --> 20:55.402
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Devil Girls!

23:10.200 --> 23:12.089
Stunning dance, Jelena.

23:12.240 --> 23:15.687
It's tragic I couldn't get you
and the girls to dance here sooner.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.451
- I hope we were worth the wait.
- And the money.

23:18.560 --> 23:19.971
What changed?

23:20.080 --> 23:22.526
Clearly, your director
doesn't have trust in me

23:22.640 --> 23:25.849
and has issues with the rumours
about how I make my money.

23:25.960 --> 23:29.362
Well, unlike her, I've never been
scared off by a bad reputation.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.609
I wanna talk to you.

23:32.760 --> 23:34.091
Now.

23:34.240 --> 23:36.208
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

23:38.360 --> 23:40.761
- If this is gonna be another--
- I'm talking.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.962
This isn't going to be another
anything.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.809
You've had your fun coming at me

23:44.920 --> 23:46.922
and I haven't stooped
to your level.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.604
Then you came at my mother.
Big mistake.

23:51.240 --> 23:54.562
Because now I'm coming for you.

24:04.200 --> 24:05.725
You're an exquisite dancer.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.689
And you throw a fantastic party.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.205
So do you.

24:09.360 --> 24:12.489
Derek Roman's roast.
I've heard it was epic.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.442
How would you like to host my parties?

24:16.560 --> 24:18.483
Hard to find someone
who can keep up.

24:18.640 --> 24:21.041
Oh, honey, I keep everything up.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.250
Not tonight.

24:23.400 --> 24:25.402
Getting late, time to go.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.847
I work for Miss Hart's boyfriend.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.083
Boyfriend? He's not my boyfriend.
I don't have a boyfriend.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.646
You call each other that all the time.

24:33.800 --> 24:36.201
Did you hit your head?
Or should I do it?

24:36.360 --> 24:37.930
Excuse me.

24:39.720 --> 24:42.849
- I was in a business deal.
- I thought you were hooking up.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.724
So, what if I was?

24:45.000 --> 24:47.890
You're not here to spoil me.
You're here to babysit me.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.210
I don't need babysitting. I don't need
you crapping on my opportunities.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.567
Unfortunately,
your business opportunities

24:54.680 --> 24:57.081
are none
of my employer's concern.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.884
I have your car ready. Shall we?

24:59.040 --> 25:01.646
Or would you like another scene?

25:04.240 --> 25:09.326
You're drawing me the bath of your life.
If you put lilac in it, I swear to God...

25:15.480 --> 25:16.925
Lionel, hey.

25:20.320 --> 25:22.402
Shouldn't you be running some drills?

25:23.520 --> 25:24.851
Harassing your players?

25:25.000 --> 25:27.571
Being harassed by you
is much more entertaining.

25:27.720 --> 25:30.246
- You're an idiot.
- You married me.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.729
About that.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.562
You signed the divorce papers.

25:46.680 --> 25:49.968
I know it took me a little while.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.242
But I was perusing the cases
at Montblanc

25:52.400 --> 25:54.323
to find just the perfect pen.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.930
You're welcome to borrow it.

25:58.680 --> 26:00.011
Well, should we toast?

26:00.440 --> 26:03.603
I know there's a bottle of champagne
in here somewhere.

26:04.840 --> 26:08.322
- Seriously?
- Yeah, this is a big deal.

26:10.160 --> 26:14.006
After three years of crazy,
I think we deserve one drink.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.490
Wendall, you're back.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.165
I put you in your car.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.290
I put myself out.

26:34.440 --> 26:36.920
Dev was just telling me
about his Olympic-sized,

26:37.040 --> 26:38.644
well, let's just say hookah.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.484
It sounds very impressive.

26:40.640 --> 26:44.361
I doubt my employer will be quite
as impressed by your behaviour.

26:44.520 --> 26:47.205
I think your boss has bigger things
to worry about.

26:47.320 --> 26:50.722
Seems someone called his hotel
in Dubai saying he was a smuggler.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.923
- It's become a whole thing.
- Smuggler? Smuggling what?

26:54.080 --> 26:56.321
They didn't ask.
I had a list ready to go.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.523
Apparently smuggler was enough
to get them off and running.

26:59.640 --> 27:02.849
Speaking of running, you can
catch that red-eye if you hurry.

27:02.960 --> 27:06.567
I'm guessing he'll have some needs
you can attend to.

27:06.720 --> 27:08.051
Well played.

27:14.360 --> 27:16.010
<i>Hey-</i>

27:19.240 --> 27:22.403
- Where's Terrence?
- He's running late.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.043
I'm gonna make you a drink.

27:26.200 --> 27:27.645
Martini?

27:27.800 --> 27:30.724
- I take my vodka straight.
- Okay.

27:37.240 --> 27:40.164
- You need help?
- No.

27:44.160 --> 27:45.844
Straight up.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.368
You look as beautiful today
as you did on your wedding day.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.450
Seems like yesterday
you and Terrence tied the knot.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.847
Sorry I haven't been around more.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.522
Life moves pretty fast.

28:12.800 --> 28:15.963
Sometimes it feels like it's moving on
without me.

28:16.360 --> 28:20.490
Like I'm missing things.

28:22.120 --> 28:26.205
You're not missing anything
with me and Terrence.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.290
You going through something?

28:30.920 --> 28:32.888
No, I didn't mean...

28:33.040 --> 28:35.168
- We're fine.
- You sure?

28:35.320 --> 28:36.651
That's--

28:36.800 --> 28:39.883
That's what I want for you guys.
For you to be happy.

28:42.280 --> 28:46.205
Terrence and I are very happy.

28:46.720 --> 28:48.290
We have a beautiful life.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.204
So you got everything you want?

28:51.560 --> 28:53.369
Yeah.

28:54.960 --> 28:56.610
The boys are good.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.682
Hunter just started preschool

29:00.280 --> 29:02.567
and TJ's in the first grade.

29:02.720 --> 29:06.406
- Terrence is an amazing dad.
- No doubt.

29:06.560 --> 29:09.769
We just bought this big house
out in Brentwood.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.324
The backyard is huge.

29:12.480 --> 29:16.565
The boys will be able to run and run.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.929
They love wearing his championship
rings. He won two of them.

29:20.040 --> 29:21.565
I knew he could do it.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.689
So did I.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.130
See?

29:28.080 --> 29:29.844
Life is good.

29:30.880 --> 29:32.211
Yo.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.371
<i>Hey-</i>

29:34.520 --> 29:37.842
- It's about time.
- My man.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.287
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

29:53.080 --> 29:55.845
"What kind of woman is she?"

30:09.680 --> 30:11.808
We need some music.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.049
Any requests?

30:18.240 --> 30:19.765
Too late.

30:21.800 --> 30:25.282
I am stealing your girl, T.

30:37.760 --> 30:40.730
- I know you wanna cut in.
- I don't know.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.769
I can tell.

30:43.360 --> 30:45.328
Come on.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.722
I taught you how to dance
freshman year.

30:48.840 --> 30:50.968
Don't make me look like no chump.

32:00.640 --> 32:04.281
I got practise early tomorrow.
Mind if I walk you to your car?

32:04.840 --> 32:06.365
Yeah.

32:07.560 --> 32:09.130
Sure.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.122
- Good night.
- Till next time, baby.

32:13.040 --> 32:15.771
- Just give me a minute.
- Okay.

32:18.240 --> 32:22.450
Thanks for helping me with Vance.

32:24.160 --> 32:26.049
Putting on a show.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.931
Right. A show.

32:47.760 --> 32:50.570
- Look, Ahsha--
- I have one question.

32:50.720 --> 32:53.803
Is this the end of something
or the start of something?

32:53.960 --> 32:56.850
- What are you talking about?
- The coke.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.004
Is that what you're used to?
Is this your norm?

33:00.160 --> 33:02.003
No, no.

33:02.160 --> 33:03.650
And it won't be.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.246
Because this kind of thing
hurts people, Derek.

33:06.360 --> 33:10.445
- It wrecked my parents' relationship.
- Ahsha, I promise you

33:10.600 --> 33:12.284
that's not gonna happen to us.

33:14.920 --> 33:17.924
- All right.
- All right?

33:19.720 --> 33:21.051
All right.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.681
Kind of late to be working out.

34:12.840 --> 34:15.889
- I'm dedicated.
- I know.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.762
I saw you with him.

34:19.080 --> 34:21.400
Is that why
you're late-night stalking me?

34:21.560 --> 34:24.530
Terrence has four good years
left in him. Max.

34:24.679 --> 34:26.091
I've got eight.

34:26.239 --> 34:28.402
And I have a ring.

34:28.639 --> 34:31.007
I also have a plan, Jelena.

34:31.440 --> 34:34.887
I didn't come to the Devils
to play backup to Terrence Wall.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.967
I came to take over.

34:37.639 --> 34:40.563
Is that why you chased me?
To get what Terrence had?

34:40.719 --> 34:43.849
I chased because you're
the biggest trophy in Los Angeles.

34:45.800 --> 34:48.007
Terrence will always find fault
with you,

34:48.159 --> 34:51.050
always want you
to be someone else.

34:51.199 --> 34:53.328
But I see you for who you really are.

34:53.960 --> 34:57.009
It's exactly who I want you to be.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.967
I want you.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.527
You could run this city with me.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.967
Not just sports, everything.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.963
I'm offering you everything.

35:21.080 --> 35:23.526
What's he offering you?

35:27.280 --> 35:28.884
It's him or me, Jelena.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.443
Think real hard.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.803
Hey, coach, it's German.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.724
Dinner came and went.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.211
Where are you?

36:10.240 --> 36:12.129
Is divorce sex a thing?

36:12.280 --> 36:14.726
Because if it's not, it should be.

36:17.320 --> 36:19.846
Technically, we're not divorced.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.480
You haven't signed the papers yet.

36:25.520 --> 36:27.602
One thing at a time.

36:34.480 --> 36:36.005
Hey, you owe me for lunch.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.445
Dinner tomorrow, on you?

36:40.240 --> 36:41.571
I can't.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.884
- Can't or won't?
- I had a nice time, it's just--

36:46.320 --> 36:49.290
Pete. I don't think I'm over him yet.

36:49.920 --> 36:51.888
That seems sudden.

36:52.920 --> 36:56.811
How many women in this arena
does that guy have in his harem?

36:57.200 --> 36:59.282
I need to talk to you.

37:00.640 --> 37:02.608
Sorry.

37:08.040 --> 37:11.522
Sloane. What's going on?

37:13.800 --> 37:16.531
I had Michael send me
Oscar's phone records

37:16.680 --> 37:20.241
as well as everyone he called
the days before and after Mia's death.

37:20.880 --> 37:22.530
That's great.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.445
I also had him run Olivia's
while he was at it.

37:25.600 --> 37:30.083
Someone called her 15 times
the day she died.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.284
You.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.121
What are you hiding from me?

37:36.480 --> 37:38.323
Raquel, I swear to God--

37:38.480 --> 37:40.403
Olivia had something on me.

37:40.560 --> 37:41.891
Something bad.

37:42.040 --> 37:45.010
She said she would tell people
if I didn't stand with her

37:45.120 --> 37:47.805
- at the groundbreaking.
- Stand with her--?

37:48.320 --> 37:50.129
Raquel,

37:50.960 --> 37:53.201
do you know
what Olivia had on Oscar?

37:53.360 --> 37:55.408
No, I swear. She wouldn't tell me.

37:55.560 --> 37:57.688
I kept calling her that day.

37:57.840 --> 38:01.003
I was begging her to be reasonable.

38:01.160 --> 38:03.640
What she knew about me...

38:03.800 --> 38:06.041
What?
What did she know about you?

38:09.440 --> 38:11.761
I came into this country illegally.

38:12.880 --> 38:16.282
My parents brought me here
and I never got papers.

38:18.680 --> 38:20.569
Raquel.

38:21.720 --> 38:23.051
How did you get work?

38:23.200 --> 38:24.611
Fake social.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.451
If anyone found out,
I could be deported.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.807
I could lose Miguel.

38:32.240 --> 38:35.130
That Olivia would hold this
over your head.

38:37.360 --> 38:38.725
I won't tell anyone.

38:39.480 --> 38:40.811
Thank you.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.042
I'm still in this with you.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.009
We're still gonna take Oscar down.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.122
Take Oscar down?

38:48.080 --> 38:50.686
I don't think my father
would like that very much.

38:53.720 --> 38:55.609
<i>Next time on Hit the Floor:</i>

38:55.760 --> 38:57.285
Why are you targeting Oscar?

38:57.400 --> 38:59.243
I don't know what it is you heard.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.528
If you don't tell me,
you can tell Oscar.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.961
I can make playoffs go
in a bad direction.

39:04.120 --> 39:05.645
You'd throw an entire season?

39:05.800 --> 39:08.929
My mom stuck around
when you were drinking, but I won't.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.128
It's your choice. Me or alcohol.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.846
You're playing us against each other
for trinkets.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.725
- What? Never.
- No, no, no, I respect that.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.609
That's exactly what I'm doing.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.922
Most important thing to Jelena
is image.

39:21.040 --> 39:23.520
That's what I'm going to take
from her.
