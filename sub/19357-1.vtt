<i>We were a real business.</i>

00:46.520 --> 00:48.921
<i>That's what
you got to understand.</i>

00:51.240 --> 00:53.402
<i>We were goddamn industry...</i>

00:54.840 --> 00:57.684
<i>the kind that's the backbone
of this country.</i>

00:59.640 --> 01:00.766
Don't take my word for it.

01:00.880 --> 01:02.456
Go in the parking lot
and look on the license

01:02.480 --> 01:04.801
of that brand-new
Mercedes 450 of yours.

01:06.040 --> 01:08.566
Hey. Are you seeing this?

01:08.680 --> 01:10.011
That's Furnace Creek.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.640
This, uh, picture's
over 100 years old.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.966
Hmm.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.936
And you see this
handsome devil right here?

01:14.960 --> 01:16.564
Uh-huh.

01:16.720 --> 01:18.245
He's a Wells.

01:18.360 --> 01:22.160
Okay, so, um, I know
you're a mining company,

01:22.280 --> 01:25.090
- Mm-hmm.
- But I pictured...

01:25.200 --> 01:26.880
Well, I don't know
what I pictured exactly.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.604
I guess little... little carts

01:28.720 --> 01:30.848
going down little...
little train tracks.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.769
- Right. -I mean, what is it
that you do here?

01:32.880 --> 01:34.723
Wh-what we do
is we look for the metals

01:34.840 --> 01:36.046
and the minerals, all right?

01:36.160 --> 01:37.924
There's exploration over there,

01:38.040 --> 01:41.283
there's engineering
and there's production, right?

01:41.400 --> 01:43.767
We're prospectors.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.530
<i>Not yet'?</i>

01:46.640 --> 01:48.051
- Okay, how about this?
- Yeah...

01:48.160 --> 01:51.687
Um... so let's say that this...

01:51.840 --> 01:53.080
is the Earth.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.200
My handbag?

01:54.240 --> 01:55.924
Your handbag is Mother Earth

01:56.040 --> 01:57.610
with all of her
deep-filled mysteries

01:57.760 --> 01:59.936
and goodies on the inside that
she does not want to give up.

01:59.960 --> 02:01.689
Me, I'm man,

02:01.800 --> 02:03.882
and I'm damn curious about
what she's got inside.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.049
So, I send down what's
called an exploratory drill.

02:07.160 --> 02:10.050
I go down inside and dig around,

02:10.160 --> 02:11.730
come across something.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.207
I pull it out. It's nickel.

02:14.360 --> 02:17.762
Now, nickel's actually
75% copper and 25% nickel,

02:17.880 --> 02:19.176
but there's a whole lot
of nickel in the world,

02:19.200 --> 02:21.646
and the world needs nickels.

02:21.760 --> 02:23.842
I'm back down there getting
my second core sample,

02:23.960 --> 02:26.281
and I happen to pull up, say...

02:26.400 --> 02:27.890
silver.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.696
Now, the thing is, when you
find a little bit of this,

02:29.720 --> 02:31.416
that means there could be
a whole hell of a lot of it.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.965
So we start raising money.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.481
We raise enough money
to open a mine

02:35.600 --> 02:37.284
like the one in that picture
right here.

02:37.400 --> 02:40.563
Then...

02:40.720 --> 02:42.768
we dig it all up.

02:42.880 --> 02:47.169
Now, sometimes...
Not that often, but sometimes...

02:47.280 --> 02:50.284
The prospecting gods are having
a party at the Pearly Gates,

02:50.440 --> 02:53.330
and we get real, real,
really lucky.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.164
And we dig down in there,

02:55.320 --> 02:58.164
then we find
a little metal called...

02:58.320 --> 03:00.322
gold.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.368
- Yes.
- Kenny.

03:06.480 --> 03:07.925
You like it?

03:08.080 --> 03:09.764
I love you.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.170
I love you.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.169
Old man wants to see you.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.364
Afternoon, Marianne.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.336
Hey, Pop.
Heard you want to see me.

03:23.360 --> 03:24.566
Yeah, Kenny.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.121
Get your ass in here, would you?

03:27.240 --> 03:28.605
Would you, uh, run through this

03:28.720 --> 03:30.609
Pershing County strategy
again for me?

03:30.720 --> 03:32.882
Right, um...

03:33.000 --> 03:35.367
It's about this southern part
of this Newmont property,

03:35.480 --> 03:36.766
right here.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.201
Now, Newmont just started
drilling 140 meters

03:39.360 --> 03:41.096
and they're finding
a whole lot of magnesite.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.885
If you remember, we still own
the option on Relief Canyon,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.048
which is next door.
We're not finding squat, why?

03:46.200 --> 03:47.770
We're not drilling deep enough.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.609
Let's get back in there.
Drill deeper.

03:49.720 --> 03:52.724
Go to 140 if we need to,
and we got a damn good chance

03:52.840 --> 03:54.683
of getting Relief
back in production.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.689
What about Jerritt Canyon?

03:56.800 --> 03:58.643
Well, that's your baby.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.041
You know a hell of a lot
more about it than I do.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.764
But the assays look promising.

04:02.880 --> 04:04.484
Could be fucking huge.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.369
I want you to run point on this.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.682
All in.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.882
Scale it up.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.843
Make it yours.

04:17.959 --> 04:20.440
Yes, sir.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.047
Clive Coleman's on board.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.725
Those boys will ride with you.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.441
God, we work hard
in this business.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.403
Sometimes for nothing.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.567
I wake up every morning.
I tell myself,

04:42.680 --> 04:45.411
"I don't have to do this.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.363
I get to do this."

04:49.840 --> 04:53.401
And then it's just blue skies.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.045
Blue skies, baby.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.241
<i>My old man...</i>

05:11.360 --> 05:13.328
a <i>legend.</i>

05:14.760 --> 05:18.242
<i>That was the last time
I saw him alive.</i>

05:51.680 --> 05:53.250
A little eye-opener, Kenny?

05:53.360 --> 05:55.601
God bless you, Roy.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.644
Here we are.

05:58.760 --> 06:01.127
- Boys, to the mother lode.
- Mother lode.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.242
Today be the day.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.328
<i>The geological reports on this</i>

06:05.440 --> 06:06.487
are highly encouraging.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.080
We are taking a very
aggressive approach.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.200
Prospectus?
Of course.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.056
I can have my secretary
send you one right out.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.242
But I got to tell you,
this offering,

06:14.360 --> 06:16.044
it's already over-subscribed.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.096
You know, we can always try
and get you in on the next one.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.726
No, no.
Yea, I understand.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.086
Shit.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.965
Watching the time?
It's 11:15, Kenny.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.447
Oh, Christ.

06:30.360 --> 06:32.249
Where would I be without you?

06:39.560 --> 06:41.608
Mr. Wells?

06:41.720 --> 06:43.449
- Yes.
- Lloyd Stanton.

06:43.560 --> 06:45.244
- Hello, Lloyd. Kenny Wells.
- Hi.

06:45.360 --> 06:46.816
This is my colleague,
Henry Andrews.

06:46.840 --> 06:47.960
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hey.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.241
- Come on back.
- Absolutely.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.727
Thank you.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.970
So, what can we do for ya?

06:59.080 --> 07:00.969
Well, why don't we wait
for Clive?

07:01.080 --> 07:03.321
Oh, uh, Mr. Coleman
got tied up in a meeting.

07:03.480 --> 07:04.845
No offense, boys,

07:04.960 --> 07:07.088
but I'm supposed to be meeting
with Clive.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.009
None taken, but if you were
supposed to be

07:09.120 --> 07:11.202
meeting with Clive, you
would be meeting with Clive.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.129
All right.
Here is what we have.

07:16.240 --> 07:19.244
We are developing some
very exciting properties

07:19.360 --> 07:22.125
that are spot-on
for your investor profile.

07:22.240 --> 07:26.962
Low buy-in
with a sizable upside.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.496
- Mm-hmm.
- And the beautiful part is

07:28.520 --> 07:32.241
they are all only 12 to 18
months and cash positive.

07:32.360 --> 07:33.566
- Manitoba?
- Yeah.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.485
We picked up an option
on a skip claim at an auction.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.165
Right, but it's
a 90-day option.

07:38.280 --> 07:39.611
Yes, the window is narrow,

07:39.720 --> 07:41.096
but if you have a look
at the Jerritt,

07:41.120 --> 07:42.496
you'll see a very promising
shale formation

07:42.520 --> 07:44.841
that hasn't been tapped yet.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.802
Mr. Wells,
Washoe has a practical value

07:49.920 --> 07:51.126
hovering just above zero.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.044
Your debt load is untenable,

07:53.200 --> 07:55.965
and you bring us, uh, raw land
with no infrastructure,

07:56.120 --> 07:58.361
no fungible assets.
I mean,

07:58.480 --> 08:00.176
you can't possibly expect us
to underwrite this.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.441
Yeah. I'm talking about
a small offering here.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.160
As I said in the beginning,
a low buy-in.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.362
Now, if you'll take
a second look at the Jerritt,

08:06.480 --> 08:08.528
you will see what I see.

08:08.640 --> 08:11.041
And that's money.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.049
Not our money.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.804
<i>See, the... the thing is</i>

08:43.960 --> 08:46.167
<i>that the whole economy
had turned,</i>

08:46.280 --> 08:48.601
<i>particularly for commodities.</i>

08:51.240 --> 08:52.924
<i>Close of the day,</i>

08:53.040 --> 08:55.407
<i>Washoe was trading
at four cents a share</i>

08:55.520 --> 08:57.682
<i>if it was trading at all.</i>

08:57.800 --> 08:59.928
Washoe Mining. There's this
great little land lease.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.408
'Cause this is a once
in a lifetime opportunity.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.403
Right. Washoe. Washoe Mining.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.006
You know, carrying the...
carrying on the business.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.566
You know, there's still
minerals out there.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.936
We just got to find them, right?

09:11.960 --> 09:13.016
Yeah, all right, all right.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.520
Thank... thank you
for your time. Bye.

09:17.400 --> 09:18.606
I could...

09:18.720 --> 09:20.245
<i>12 to 18 months...</i>

09:20.360 --> 09:22.283
cash positive.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.801
A deal...

09:24.920 --> 09:26.046
Goddamn, I am calling you.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.650
Fuck whatever time it is.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.690
<i>Washoe Mining,</i>

09:32.840 --> 09:34.604
<i>the company that my grandfather</i>

09:34.760 --> 09:37.969
<i>literally scratched out of
the side of a Nevada mountain,</i>

09:38.080 --> 09:42.165
<i>the company that my father
made into a real player,</i>

09:42.280 --> 09:45.329
<i>was almost gone.</i>

09:45.440 --> 09:47.807
<i>Almost.</i>

09:51.880 --> 09:55.168
<i>I'd already, uh, lost my house,</i>

09:55.320 --> 09:58.403
<i>and I was, uh...
I was living with Kay.</i>

09:58.520 --> 10:02.047
<i>And, uh, we-we were about
to lose that, too.</i>

10:12.720 --> 10:15.690
<i>I had a half gallon
of Seagram's in me.</i>

10:15.840 --> 10:18.446
<i>Shit, most people would have
been dead, but not me. No.</i>

10:20.440 --> 10:22.329
<i>Instead...</i>

10:22.440 --> 10:24.966
<i>I had a dream.</i>

10:28.480 --> 10:31.450
<i>I mean, I mean,
I mean, literally, I...</i>

10:31.560 --> 10:34.404
<i>I had a dream.</i>

10:40.760 --> 10:44.207
<i>Indonesia.</i>

10:44.320 --> 10:46.129
<i>Gold.</i>

10:49.000 --> 10:52.607
<i>Now, I'd been to Indonesia
five or six years earlier.</i>

10:52.720 --> 10:54.563
<i>I still had a little money
in my pocket.</i>

10:54.680 --> 10:56.330
<i>You know, Indonesia was booming,</i>

10:56.440 --> 10:58.807
<i>and I was looking
for a way to get in.</i>

11:03.200 --> 11:04.884
<i>Back then, if you wanted</i>

11:05.000 --> 11:06.576
<i>to put a hole in the ground
in Indonesia,</i>

11:06.600 --> 11:09.729
<i>you wanted Mike Acosta
telling you where to dig.</i>

11:09.840 --> 11:12.207
<i>He's what they called
a River Walker.</i>

11:12.320 --> 11:14.004
<i>Yeah, a real hands-on
geologist.</i>

11:14.120 --> 11:15.120
<i>The real deal.</i>

11:17.040 --> 11:18.326
<i>Oxford College, MIT.</i>

11:18.440 --> 11:19.726
<i>His mom was Venezuelan.</i>

11:19.840 --> 11:22.081
<i>His dad was English.</i>

11:24.160 --> 11:25.480
<i>Now, you see,
he'd just discovered</i>

11:25.560 --> 11:28.166
<i>the largest copper strike
in Southeast Asia,</i>

11:28.280 --> 11:32.524
<i>and everybody wanted
a piece of him, including me.</i>

11:32.640 --> 11:35.325
You got the Nazca Plate,
the Pacific Plate.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.727
Juan de Fuca,
North American, South American.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.609
Aleutian, Marianas, Tonga.

11:39.760 --> 11:42.491
The plates rubbing
and grinding up on each other.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.284
Six trillion kilobytes
of pressure.

11:44.400 --> 11:48.166
10,000 degrees Celsius
kicking up geothermic hot spots

11:48.280 --> 11:50.169
all along the Pacific rim.

11:50.280 --> 11:54.410
<i>He called it the, uh,
the Ring of Fire theory.</i>

11:54.520 --> 11:56.522
<i>And he definitely had
everyone's attention.</i>

11:56.640 --> 11:59.166
That's how I found the copper.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.608
And that's why
I'll find the gold.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.010
You're up early.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.770
Hey.-

12:23.000 --> 12:24.570
You want to talk
about yesterday.

12:24.720 --> 12:27.849
No. I gotta go right now, babe.
I've gotta plan. Gotta plan.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.201
- Oh, wait, Kenny, Kenny, listen.
- Hmm?

12:30.320 --> 12:32.209
Carl had an idea.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.607
- American Home Carl?
- Uh-huh.

12:34.720 --> 12:37.291
He said he could, uh,
get you on for a while,

12:37.440 --> 12:39.136
- if you wanted.
- Right, right, right, right.

12:39.160 --> 12:41.925
Yeah, I don't think that's
going to be necessary, babe.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.690
Yeah, but it'd just be temporary

12:43.800 --> 12:45.404
till the market turns.

12:45.520 --> 12:48.649
We could fool around
in the warehouse.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.125
You know, I tell you...

12:51.600 --> 12:53.216
When I get done with this trip,
all right?

12:53.240 --> 12:54.520
Shouldn't take more than a week.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.000
- All right.
- What? Where you going?

12:56.080 --> 12:58.401
- If it doesn't work out,
I'll give Carl a call. -Baby...

12:58.520 --> 13:00.216
- I'll call you from the airport.
- Wait. Wait, wait.

13:00.240 --> 13:01.571
Kenny!

13:01.680 --> 13:05.082
<i>It was like
I was being called, you know?</i>

13:06.840 --> 13:09.241
<i>It was the gold calling.</i>

13:09.360 --> 13:11.124
<i>That may sound crazy to you,</i>

13:11.240 --> 13:13.163
<i>but if you...
if you knew that feeling,</i>

13:13.280 --> 13:15.408
well, you'd know.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.209
<i>Kenny Wells.
I'm down here in the, uh,</i>

13:51.320 --> 13:52.760
the lobby of the, uh,
Jakarta Palace.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.444
Uh... Yeah, listen,

13:54.600 --> 13:56.090
<i>we must've got
the times mixed up.</i>

13:56.200 --> 13:58.123
<i>Um... Let me know.
I'm down here.</i>

13:58.240 --> 14:01.369
<i>I'm in the brown suit,
I'm on the green couch.</i>

14:01.480 --> 14:02.720
I'm the good-looking guy, okay?

14:02.800 --> 14:04.256
All right.
We'll make it happen, Fuca.

14:04.280 --> 14:05.486
All right.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.600
Wells?

14:11.720 --> 14:13.529
Mike.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.881
Good to see you again.

14:19.040 --> 14:22.249
I know a local place,
a bit more color.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.488
What, they're not pouring here?

14:25.800 --> 14:27.802
Good.

14:27.920 --> 14:30.810
So,

14:30.920 --> 14:33.526
what are we talking about
here, Wells?

14:35.440 --> 14:37.010
Ring of Fire, Mike.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.610
Ring of Fire.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.690
You're playing my greatest hits.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.041
Fire's gone out of that one.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.924
Well, what are you
talking about?

14:46.040 --> 14:49.886
It's the opinion of my
fellow esteemed geologists,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.446
that the whole thing...
I'm quoting here...

14:52.560 --> 14:54.608
Is a crock of shit.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.768
Well, what the hell, you know?

14:56.880 --> 14:58.644
You called it wrong.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.729
What are you going to do?

15:01.840 --> 15:04.525
There's no right or wrong
in this business.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.927
There's only hits and misses.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.646
There's gold here.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.366
I'm glad you said that, Mike.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.807
I truly am, 'cause I...

15:22.440 --> 15:24.010
believe you.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.407
I hate to dash your hopes,
but don't you think

15:26.520 --> 15:28.576
others have come along
before you with the same thought

15:28.600 --> 15:32.525
and, from the looks of it,
deeper pockets?

15:32.640 --> 15:35.325
Ring of Fire is real, Mike.

15:35.440 --> 15:36.805
I knew it
the first time I heard.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.604
It struck me like
a fucking lightning bolt,

15:38.720 --> 15:40.324
and I never forgot it.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.488
Go ahead, laugh.
I get that all the time.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.080
But hear this.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.407
I don't just believe.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.965
I know.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.162
- No, you don't.
- I've seen it.

15:51.280 --> 15:54.409
You don't understand.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.729
- No one will back me.
- I will.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.968
You tell me where
you want to dig, Mikey,

16:00.080 --> 16:02.970
and I'll make goddamn sure
the bills are paid.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.844
No offense, Wells, but...

16:05.960 --> 16:08.691
you look like you had to rob
someone just to get here, man.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.644
You know nothing about me.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.967
You know it's still out there.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.282
I know that.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.290
I can see it in your eyes.
You still believe.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.482
I get it, and I was born on
the side of the mountain, too.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.216
My-my father scratched
everything he ever owned

16:27.240 --> 16:28.605
out of a fucking rock.
All right?

16:28.720 --> 16:29.976
Died with dirt
under his fingernails,

16:30.000 --> 16:31.684
and I intend to do the same.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.569
This business...

16:33.720 --> 16:35.324
wrote me off years ago.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.736
All right, maybe you're
not running the hottest

16:36.760 --> 16:37.976
in your career right now either,

16:38.000 --> 16:39.206
so let's prove them wrong.

16:39.320 --> 16:40.481
You and me.

16:40.640 --> 16:41.856
Let's prove them all
fucking wrong.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.166
And you know why?

16:44.360 --> 16:46.681
You do know why,
because the Ring of Fire

16:46.800 --> 16:49.963
is right, Mike.
You called it.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.811
You just haven't found it yet.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.047
Tell me I'm crazy.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.567
I'll be on the next plane.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.608
You're crazy.

17:16.319 --> 17:17.810
You have a hat, Wells?

17:20.960 --> 17:23.361
Yeah, I got a hat.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.931
Why, we going somewhere?

17:25.040 --> 17:27.691
<i>Up river.</i>

17:27.800 --> 17:30.201
<i>What river is that, Mike?</i>

17:30.360 --> 17:32.010
You're late.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.929
<i>The only one that matters.</i>

17:59.000 --> 18:00.889
The Dayak have been
panning this river

18:01.000 --> 18:03.480
for over 5,000 years.

18:03.640 --> 18:06.041
That's how it got its name,

18:06.160 --> 18:08.208
Daya Kensana.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.924
What's it mean?

18:10.040 --> 18:11.804
"Daya" means "upstream."

18:12.800 --> 18:14.802
"Kensana" means "gold."

18:15.880 --> 18:18.281
You got to be shitting me.

18:38.440 --> 18:39.965
Wells.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.241
Wells.

18:41.360 --> 18:42.930
We're here.

18:43.040 --> 18:46.249
So, listen, the Dayak
are warrior people,

18:46.360 --> 18:48.886
probably best known for Dayak,

18:49.000 --> 18:50.604
headhunting.

18:50.720 --> 18:53.166
But it doesn't happen much
anymore.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.169
They might be thinking
we're some traders

18:55.320 --> 18:56.446
or someone's mother-in-law.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.801
How long?

19:19.080 --> 19:21.447
This jungle
will... will test you.

19:22.800 --> 19:26.850
It will hold you up, weigh you,

19:26.960 --> 19:28.724
and decide your worth
within an ounce.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.569
Do you always talk
like this, Mike?

19:30.680 --> 19:33.206
Like a book on tape?

19:33.320 --> 19:35.641
I suppose I do.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.525
Where are we going?

19:40.640 --> 19:42.324
Up.

19:55.080 --> 19:57.287
Take a look.

20:06.720 --> 20:08.324
Oh, my God.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.888
It's my dream.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.889
There have been
a few folks up here

20:17.000 --> 20:18.809
tapping over the years,

20:18.920 --> 20:21.764
but have all focused on the
foothills far to the south.

20:21.880 --> 20:25.248
But what interests me
is the other way.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.408
That small depression,

20:27.520 --> 20:31.241
like a giant left a footprint
walking away.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.886
Something happened there, Wells.

20:34.040 --> 20:37.886
Something hot and angry.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.606
That's where we'll find
the tasty bits.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.485
My dream...

20:48.320 --> 20:50.288
is out there.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.528
Damn right it is.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.568
<i>Look, if it's the big boys</i>

20:57.680 --> 20:59.440
<i>that you're thinking about
investing in us...</i>

20:59.520 --> 21:01.124
<i>You know, the Harvard endowment</i>

21:01.280 --> 21:03.726
<i>or some...
some pension fund, right?...</i>

21:03.840 --> 21:06.320
I am not your guy.

21:06.440 --> 21:08.966
But the little guys, right,

21:09.120 --> 21:10.724
guys that you don't even
know about,

21:10.840 --> 21:12.524
the, uh, the hustlers,
the scrappers,

21:12.640 --> 21:14.449
the make-it-happen
motherfuckers,

21:14.560 --> 21:16.483
those are my guys.

21:17.840 --> 21:20.491
How much do we need?

21:20.600 --> 21:24.321
Seven. Seven-fifty to start.

21:24.440 --> 21:26.841
Okay.

21:27.800 --> 21:30.371
How much do we need?

21:30.480 --> 21:32.562
It isn't just a lease.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.364
We're in Indonesia.

21:34.520 --> 21:38.684
That means getting a permit
and lining pockets.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.609
Equipment.
You don't just do this

21:40.720 --> 21:42.210
with a couple of shovels
and a pickax.

21:42.360 --> 21:43.930
I'll get the money.

21:44.040 --> 21:45.769
Whatever it takes.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.281
- What's that?
- It's a contract.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.890
Read it.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.968
Sign it.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.968
Keep it.

22:20.560 --> 22:23.211
<i>I could feel it in my bones.</i>

22:23.360 --> 22:26.091
<i>I was selling something
that I believed in.</i>

22:29.360 --> 22:30.646
20-K minimum buy-in, right,

22:30.760 --> 22:32.616
and the shares are fucking
flying off the shelf.

22:32.640 --> 22:33.920
I mean, no risk, no gain, right?

22:33.960 --> 22:36.440
No, 'cause it's coming in
right now.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.289
No, Acosta. Michael Acosta.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.616
It's the largest
copper strike in history,

22:39.640 --> 22:41.085
and that's the guy that we got.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.976
Kay, get those shoes shined
for dancing, baby.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.216
<i>We don't even have
the exploration permits.</i>

22:44.240 --> 22:46.607
What are they selling?

22:46.760 --> 22:48.250
What are we selling?

22:50.200 --> 22:52.009
Mikey, we're selling the story.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.930
And right now, the story is you.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.280
Speaking of which, what the fuck
are you doing right now?

22:57.360 --> 22:59.931
I'm down in Kupang City
looking at coring equipment.

23:00.040 --> 23:02.930
Acosta's in Kupang City
looking at coring equipment.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.610
He's in Kupang City as we speak.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.563
It-it's a fucking...

23:06.680 --> 23:08.416
Kupang City. We're getting
the coring equipment...

23:08.440 --> 23:10.124
You're magic, Mike.
You're fucking magic.

23:21.680 --> 23:22.727
You there, Mike?

23:24.200 --> 23:26.248
Two hundred
and sixty-seven thousand

23:26.360 --> 23:28.408
four hundred and thirty-four...

23:28.520 --> 23:30.284
<i>dollars.</i>

23:30.400 --> 23:32.846
That's not exactly the number
I had in mind, Wells.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.167
Well, look, I may be able
to borrow a little bit

23:35.280 --> 23:37.089
against it, but, you know...

23:37.200 --> 23:38.929
No, you know what?
Truth, Mike?

23:39.040 --> 23:40.326
Th-that's it for now.

23:40.480 --> 23:43.245
Th-that's it.
Can you make it work? Hmm?

23:44.960 --> 23:46.166
I can make anything work.

23:46.280 --> 23:49.045
You work out of a bar, Wells?

23:50.320 --> 23:52.527
Keeping a lid on expenses, Mike.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.802
Making the dollar holler.

23:56.920 --> 23:58.490
We're in!

24:55.560 --> 24:57.961
Record player. That's classy.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.684
Am I paying for that, Mikey?

24:59.800 --> 25:01.529
Six-man crews,

25:01.640 --> 25:04.803
12-hour shifts
around the clock.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.571
Tomorrow we'll start looking
at our core samples.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.170
Then we'll send
the most promising

25:09.280 --> 25:11.760
down river to the assay lab.

25:11.880 --> 25:13.564
The mother lode, Mike.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.008
You're out there, baby.

26:00.160 --> 26:03.448
The man that invented
the hamburger was smart, Mike.

26:03.560 --> 26:06.086
The man who invented
the cheeseburger,

26:06.200 --> 26:07.850
now, that's the genius.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.731
Don't ask where
the meat came from. Hmm?

26:10.880 --> 26:14.930
Have you ever read
Christopher Columbus' journals?

26:15.040 --> 26:16.849
Of course not.

26:16.960 --> 26:19.611
In his petition
to the queen of Spain,

26:19.760 --> 26:21.489
he promised the conversion

26:21.640 --> 26:26.407
to her holy faith
of a great number of peoples.

26:26.560 --> 26:31.441
And he went on
and mentioned God 26 times.

26:31.560 --> 26:35.042
Gold, on the other hand,

26:35.160 --> 26:39.210
he mentioned 114 times.

26:39.320 --> 26:40.845
Smart dago.

26:40.960 --> 26:43.042
I've been wanting
to ask you something, Wells.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.690
Fire away, Mike.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.121
What's the meaning of
the tattoo on your arm?

26:47.240 --> 26:48.890
Oh, it's a bird.

26:50.440 --> 26:54.206
It's from a poem I read
when I was a kid.

26:54.320 --> 26:56.482
Bird with no feet...

26:56.600 --> 26:58.443
sleeps in the wind.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.169
Assay!

27:14.280 --> 27:16.362
Assay! Assay!

27:36.080 --> 27:37.730
Mike, Mike!

27:37.880 --> 27:40.884
Hey. These things, they look
worse every time we get one.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.736
Do you remember what
I told you about patience?

27:42.760 --> 27:44.696
Yeah, you-you remember
what I told you about money?

27:44.720 --> 27:45.881
- Yeah.
- Huh?

27:46.000 --> 27:47.816
- You said that it wasn't a problem.
- Well, it...

27:47.840 --> 27:49.410
it's a fucking problem now!

28:37.360 --> 28:38.441
Hey!

28:41.280 --> 28:42.281
Hey!

28:42.400 --> 28:43.686
Hey...

28:43.800 --> 28:44.687
Hey, wait!

28:44.800 --> 28:45.801
Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay!

28:49.440 --> 28:50.440
Hey!

28:50.480 --> 28:51.845
Stay...

28:53.840 --> 28:55.729
Hey! Stay-

28:55.840 --> 28:57.126
Stay!

29:05.560 --> 29:07.562
<i>On top of everything else,</i>

29:07.720 --> 29:11.008
<i>I... I got a bad case
of malaria,</i>

29:11.120 --> 29:13.566
<i>which kills like something
like a million people a year,</i>

29:13.680 --> 29:15.091
<i>something like that.</i>

29:15.200 --> 29:18.283
<i>Suddenly, I was on the list.</i>

29:27.320 --> 29:29.800
Maybe... maybe we were
pushing them too hard.

29:29.920 --> 29:32.924
Maybe we should just
take it easy, you know?

29:33.080 --> 29:34.525
Cut them in.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.007
You know,
give them some ownership.

29:37.120 --> 29:41.489
Maybe they'll come back,
you know?

29:41.600 --> 29:43.602
Let them know that they
got something at the end,

29:43.760 --> 29:45.444
you know, when it all works out.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.121
Give them a piece of the pie,
you know?

29:51.240 --> 29:52.321
Get up.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.681
Come on, get up.

29:59.240 --> 30:00.730
I'm freezing, Mike.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.721
Don't let me die
and have nothing, okay?

30:19.560 --> 30:21.130
Get some rest now.

31:54.920 --> 31:56.604
I'm pulling the plug.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.329
No.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.290
No, no, no, no, no.

32:04.440 --> 32:06.283
Don't pull the plug, Mike.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.087
No, no.
You can't do that, Mikey.

32:10.200 --> 32:13.204
Let's get you
out of here, Wells.

32:13.320 --> 32:15.084
What's the plan, Mikey?

32:15.240 --> 32:17.004
Hmm?

32:17.160 --> 32:20.767
Now, I know you got
a plan, Mike, hmm?

32:20.880 --> 32:23.281
I know you got a plan.

32:25.480 --> 32:27.244
What's the plan, hmm?

32:29.480 --> 32:30.480
What's the plan?

32:33.680 --> 32:36.206
They need clean water.

32:36.320 --> 32:37.731
If we get filter systems
up here,

32:37.840 --> 32:39.968
I think they might come back.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.800
I got about $1,800
on this Visa right there.

32:59.920 --> 33:02.924
Close to 500
on this Diner's Club.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.527
Use it all, hmm?

33:11.640 --> 33:13.961
Use it all, Mikey.

33:47.360 --> 33:49.966
<i>Damned if he didn't go</i>

33:50.080 --> 33:51.605
<i>to every single place</i>

33:51.720 --> 33:54.087
<i>that every one
of our workers lived.</i>

33:54.200 --> 33:56.407
<i>Streams that had no name.</i>

33:56.520 --> 33:59.444
<i>All feeding
the great Kensana River.</i>

34:00.920 --> 34:03.161
Whoa!

34:13.560 --> 34:14.846
But you know what?

34:14.960 --> 34:16.643
<i>The workers came back.</i>

34:18.400 --> 34:22.688
<i>I spent the next few weeks
in a malarial haze.</i>

34:22.800 --> 34:24.882
<i>Should've been dead.</i>

34:25.040 --> 34:28.408
<i>But Mike kept it all going.</i>

35:07.320 --> 35:09.448
What day is it?

35:10.920 --> 35:12.410
No idea.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.528
- Month?
- August.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.484
You been sitting there
this whole time?

35:23.640 --> 35:25.608
Let's not get carried away.

35:29.760 --> 35:32.684
What'd the report say?
What's the news?

35:35.880 --> 35:37.769
We pulled 17 more cores.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.648
What?

35:41.760 --> 35:44.491
- No good?
- No good.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.965
Mm.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.649
More in the vicinity of great.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.408
Fuck you, Mike.
Don't mess with me, man.

35:56.840 --> 35:59.446
Eighth of an ounce per ton.

36:11.960 --> 36:13.849
Eighth... eighth of
an ounce per what?

36:13.960 --> 36:16.042
Eighth of an ounce per ton.

36:20.760 --> 36:22.762
What... what are you...
what are you saying, Mike?

36:22.880 --> 36:25.247
We got a strike in.

36:26.600 --> 36:27.965
We got a gold mine?

36:29.520 --> 36:31.727
- We got a gold mine?
- We got a gold mine.

36:36.680 --> 36:39.445
We got a gold mine, Mike!
We got a gold mine, Mike!

36:39.560 --> 36:41.881
- We got a gold mine.
- We got a goddamn gold mine!

36:42.000 --> 36:44.207
We got a gold mine!

36:44.320 --> 36:47.005
We got a goddamn gold mine!

36:47.120 --> 36:48.531
We got a goddamn...

36:48.680 --> 36:50.091
Gold mine!

36:50.200 --> 36:51.690
We got a gold mine!

36:51.800 --> 36:53.016
I knew it, I knew it,

36:53.040 --> 36:55.646
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

36:57.240 --> 37:00.642
We got a goddamn gold mine!

37:00.760 --> 37:02.250
Fuck you, mosquitoes!

37:04.040 --> 37:06.042
<i>That moment...</i>

37:06.200 --> 37:09.568
<i>there's no way I could possibly
describe the feeling.</i>

37:09.680 --> 37:11.569
<i>It's amazing
how a little gold dust</i>

37:11.680 --> 37:13.842
<i>can just change everything.</i>

37:14.000 --> 37:17.482
<i>Now, for better or worse,
the ride had begun,</i>

37:17.600 --> 37:19.568
<i>and what a goddamn ride.</i>

37:22.120 --> 37:23.246
Okay, Okay.

37:23.360 --> 37:24.521
Oh, thank God.

37:26.440 --> 37:28.761
- To the best goddamn team
in the business. -Fucking-A.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.041
You're a stand-up guy, Kenny.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.686
- Sharing the wealth.
- Crazy, huh?

37:32.800 --> 37:33.801
To the mother lode.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.604
The mother lode.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.770
All right, baby.
Do me a favor.

37:47.880 --> 37:49.325
Close your eyes, will ya?

37:49.440 --> 37:51.442
- All right.
- Cover them with your hands.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.484
- Keep 'em closed.
- Okay.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.961
- I got you. I got you.
I got you. -Oh. Okay.

38:01.040 --> 38:05.728
One, two, three.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.764
It's gonna be our place.

38:12.880 --> 38:15.565
Away from it all, above it all,
just like we always wanted.

38:15.680 --> 38:17.045
You like it?

38:17.160 --> 38:18.730
- Huh?
- Yes, of... Yes.

38:18.840 --> 38:22.765
Okay, look... the house...
right here, all right?

38:22.880 --> 38:25.531
The kitchen, facing there.
The great room over here.

38:25.640 --> 38:27.483
- Two fireplaces.
- No...

38:27.600 --> 38:28.681
Can we afford this?

38:28.800 --> 38:30.689
Almost, baby. Almost.
We're almost there.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.880
All right, look at this.
Couple bedrooms on that end.

38:32.960 --> 38:34.644
- Couple bedrooms on that end.
- Okay.

38:34.760 --> 38:36.683
Look at this playground
for the kids, huh?

38:36.800 --> 38:38.040
How many kids you want to have?

38:43.960 --> 38:45.371
<i>Kitchen has to stay over here.</i>

38:45.480 --> 38:46.970
We gotta put it over here

38:47.080 --> 38:48.400
- to get the morning light.
- Yes!

38:48.440 --> 38:49.896
And a second kitchen
over on this side.

38:49.920 --> 38:52.048
A third one across the creek.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.049
<i>A fourth one
up there with the elk.</i>

39:12.400 --> 39:14.528
- Kenny, Kenny.
- Mm?

39:14.640 --> 39:15.926
This is Walt Kealer.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.844
- He publishes
<i>Gold Digger</i> magazine. -Mm.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.002
We reach
half a million subscribers,

39:20.120 --> 39:21.531
and they'd all love to know

39:21.640 --> 39:23.400
what you got cooking
over there in Indonesia.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.403
If you have a minute,
I'll buy you a drink.

39:27.320 --> 39:29.322
He's all yours, Walt.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.331
Hell, I read
<i>Gold Digger</i> magazine.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.329
Come on over.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.456
They say you bring this in,
you'll get the Golden Pickaxe.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.296
- Aw, shut up.
- What do you say about that?

39:41.320 --> 39:44.529
I'd say you
probably just jinxed it.

39:44.640 --> 39:47.689
- How many ounces you guessing?
- Hmm.

39:47.800 --> 39:50.644
Millions, Walt.
Absolutely millions.

39:50.760 --> 39:51.966
Placer mining?

39:52.080 --> 39:54.606
No. Hard rock.
This is varsity ball.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.210
How's the infrastructure?

39:56.320 --> 39:57.924
Building it from the ground up.

40:01.680 --> 40:03.045
Any message you'd like to give

40:03.160 --> 40:05.401
to the readers
of <i>Gold Digger</i> magazine?

40:09.880 --> 40:14.169
The last card you turn over
is the only one that matters.

40:14.280 --> 40:17.090
- Kenny, it's good to see you.
- Good morning, Beverly.

40:17.200 --> 40:19.123
Clive, how are you?

40:19.240 --> 40:21.607
- There he is.
- Good to see you, sir.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.688
- It's good to see you, son.
- Mm-hmm.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.531
You know, your father and I,

40:26.640 --> 40:28.802
we started together
in this business.

40:28.920 --> 40:31.446
Hell, I mean,
he put me in the business.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.210
I don't have to tell you that.

40:33.320 --> 40:36.688
He always spoke very highly
of you, Clive.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.643
He's one of the best men
I ever knew.

40:39.720 --> 40:40.926
- Yeah.
- Now!

40:41.080 --> 40:43.128
You have gone
from four to 23 cents

40:43.240 --> 40:45.368
on your first assay results.

40:45.480 --> 40:48.450
And you pulled in two more
to confirm those findings?

40:48.560 --> 40:50.449
Three more.

40:50.560 --> 40:51.686
- Three more?
- Mm-hmm.

40:51.840 --> 40:53.080
Well, that's fantastic.

40:53.200 --> 40:56.124
Well, I would like to underwrite

40:56.240 --> 40:59.449
a private placement
of Washoe stock.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.090
And I believe that we can raise

41:01.200 --> 41:03.328
anywhere between
$8 million and $10 million.

41:03.480 --> 41:04.720
Well, capital is definitely

41:04.840 --> 41:06.569
at the top of our agenda
right now.

41:06.680 --> 41:08.091
Well, yes, it is.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.806
And a lot of people are going
to want to make this deal,

41:10.920 --> 41:12.285
but history is on our side.

41:12.400 --> 41:13.686
Mm-hmm.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.416
But I just wish you'd
brought this to me sooner.

41:15.440 --> 41:18.011
- I could have helped you
from the get-go. -Hey.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.727
- Well, here we are.
- Here we are.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.251
Lloyd...

41:23.360 --> 41:25.601
top that off for me, will you?

41:25.720 --> 41:29.930
Straight black
with a spicer chaser.

41:50.360 --> 41:52.328
Mr. Wells, uh, coffee.

41:52.440 --> 41:53.771
There we are, Lloyd.
Thank you.

41:53.880 --> 41:56.008
Stanton, Mr. Wells has agreed

41:56.120 --> 41:59.841
to give us his business
on one condition.

42:01.880 --> 42:04.201
Lloyd, I want you

42:04.320 --> 42:06.402
to personally handle my account.

42:06.520 --> 42:08.170
I-I need you to be

42:08.280 --> 42:09.805
available to me 24/7,

42:09.960 --> 42:14.329
365, as you will be riding
shotgun in my jockstrap.

42:14.440 --> 42:17.171
Absolutely. Yes. Thank you.

42:17.280 --> 42:18.536
Well, let's quit
standing around here

42:18.560 --> 42:20.005
and go make
some goddamn money, huh?

42:20.120 --> 42:21.326
That sounds good to me.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.684
Kenny? Kenny?

42:25.800 --> 42:27.609
Kenny, did you read
the last report?

42:29.840 --> 42:31.365
<i>Kenny, did you read
the last report?</i>

42:31.480 --> 42:32.811
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

42:32.920 --> 42:35.764
<i>No, I'm looking at them
right now. Holy shit!</i>

42:35.880 --> 42:38.486
Holy shit is right, my friend.

42:43.720 --> 42:45.370
<i>No, it's unbelievable.</i>

42:46.600 --> 42:47.886
Holy shit.

42:48.040 --> 42:49.929
<i>Bobby, I can hear your wife</i>

42:50.040 --> 42:51.280
smiling from here.

42:51.400 --> 42:52.890
Right back where you belong,
Kenny.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.401
Yeah, there's a lot of ghosts
in this building, boys.

42:55.520 --> 42:57.761
Oh, nice work, Todd!

42:57.880 --> 42:59.803
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

43:23.520 --> 43:24.851
All right, men.

43:24.960 --> 43:27.122
Now, this stock is going
to start cooking.

43:27.240 --> 43:28.810
Make sure you put
a little bit away.

43:28.920 --> 43:31.491
Sell some. Just the long way.
Just in case.

43:31.600 --> 43:32.886
- Especially you.
- What?

43:33.000 --> 43:34.200
- Put a little bit away.
- I...

43:34.240 --> 43:35.416
For the first time in your life,

43:35.440 --> 43:36.965
think rainy day, Bobby, okay?

43:37.080 --> 43:38.411
- Of-of course. Of course.
- Hey.

43:38.520 --> 43:39.931
- What?
- Okay?

43:40.040 --> 43:42.327
Okay.
Okay.

43:53.480 --> 43:56.370
Oh, we're going to be
so fucking rich.

44:10.440 --> 44:13.250
At least look like
you're working, man.

44:18.680 --> 44:21.524
Yeah?

44:26.000 --> 44:27.490
What do you got?

44:27.640 --> 44:29.404
Wildcatters, basically.

44:29.560 --> 44:32.006
This Mike Acosta
has had some success. Copper.

44:32.120 --> 44:34.407
Got taken over by Freeport Mac.

44:34.520 --> 44:37.364
- It's all in there.
- Yeah. I've heard of Acosta.

44:39.680 --> 44:41.967
- I like <i>this.
But I think We start</i>

44:42.080 --> 44:44.367
with the good news,
which is that we are, uh,

44:44.480 --> 44:47.927
50% allocated and, uh,
we want to set aside, uh,

44:48.080 --> 44:49.844
30 of the remaining 50
for you boys...

44:49.960 --> 44:52.247
There's more food here.
Don't drink through lunch.

44:52.360 --> 44:53.560
All right?

44:53.640 --> 44:55.608
Or just eat something as well.

44:55.720 --> 44:57.449
Hey, Kay!
- Phone!

44:57.560 --> 45:00.689
- What?
- Phone, please.

45:00.840 --> 45:02.800
- That one. Thank you.
- You want me to answer it?

45:05.080 --> 45:06.684
Hello.

45:06.800 --> 45:09.485
Uh, Washoe Mining.
How may I direct your call?

45:09.640 --> 45:11.961
- Hi. Uh, Kenneth Wells, please.
- Please hold.

45:12.080 --> 45:14.048
Kenny, you got a call!

45:16.800 --> 45:18.404
- Thank you, dear.
- Love you, baby.

45:18.520 --> 45:19.407
All right.

45:19.520 --> 45:20.646
Kenny Wells.

45:20.760 --> 45:24.481
This is Brian Woolf at
Brown, Thomas in New York.

45:24.600 --> 45:26.648
I'm with the minerals
and oil group.

45:26.760 --> 45:28.205
No shit.

45:32.760 --> 45:34.000
Uh-huh.

45:35.080 --> 45:36.570
Uh-huh.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.525
Well, that sounds
outstanding, Brian.

45:39.640 --> 45:41.085
And let me tell you something.

45:41.200 --> 45:42.804
I'm looking forward to it.

45:43.640 --> 45:44.971
All right.

45:53.640 --> 45:55.881
They're fucking flying me out.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.416
They're fucking flying me out.

45:58.440 --> 45:59.930
Come on!

46:02.920 --> 46:04.843
<i>Yeah, the way I see it,</i>

46:04.960 --> 46:08.567
<i>what banks do... who knows?</i>

46:08.680 --> 46:11.968
<i>But what made this country
is not tight asses in suits...</i>

46:12.120 --> 46:13.576
<i>No offense...
Taking the easy way down,</i>

46:13.600 --> 46:15.648
<i>but guys like me and Mike
who jump.</i>

46:15.760 --> 46:17.125
<i>What we have</i>

46:17.240 --> 46:19.527
is a private placement
in play here.

46:19.640 --> 46:22.484
Already over 50% subscribed.

46:22.600 --> 46:24.648
Now, if the numbers
keep coming in good,

46:24.800 --> 46:27.485
which...
they're fucking going to,

46:27.600 --> 46:30.171
the sky is the limit
on this thing.

46:30.280 --> 46:31.776
You don't have to sell us.
We've done the math.

46:31.800 --> 46:33.006
We believe you're sitting on

46:33.120 --> 46:34.804
the largest gold find
of the decade.

46:36.080 --> 46:38.287
May I speak plainly,
Mr. Wells?

46:38.440 --> 46:40.761
Of course, Brian.
That's the only way to speak.

46:40.880 --> 46:43.167
Our clients are going to want
to see a serious plan

46:43.320 --> 46:46.642
to turn lab results
in a volatile region

46:46.760 --> 46:49.206
into an investment we can all
stake our reputations on.

46:49.320 --> 46:50.207
It's not going to be a problem.

46:50.320 --> 46:51.560
No, it's not a problem, per se,

46:51.640 --> 46:54.120
but the fact remains
that neither of you have taken

46:54.240 --> 46:55.960
a find of this magnitude
through production.

46:56.040 --> 46:58.168
Wait just a minute there, Brian.

46:58.280 --> 47:00.806
We-we found it,
we can dig it up.

47:00.960 --> 47:02.376
- It's not that complicated.
- Actually,

47:02.400 --> 47:04.376
historically, we found
it could be quite complicated,

47:04.400 --> 47:06.129
and we'd like the opportunity

47:06.240 --> 47:09.289
to help you formulate how you
present the operation side.

47:12.040 --> 47:13.804
Wh-what-what exactly
does that mean?

47:13.920 --> 47:15.445
I'd like you both to consider

47:15.600 --> 47:17.090
bringing on a strategic partner.

47:17.200 --> 47:19.680
Oh.

47:20.960 --> 47:22.564
All right.

47:22.680 --> 47:25.411
Have any of you ever

47:25.520 --> 47:27.727
set one of your...
your handmade loafers

47:27.840 --> 47:30.923
down in the hole
in the side of a mountain?

47:31.040 --> 47:32.769
- No.
- No. We have.

47:32.880 --> 47:34.325
Washoe has history.

47:34.440 --> 47:36.727
We've done a fairly thorough
analysis of Washoe,

47:36.840 --> 47:39.844
Mr. Wells, and we feel
like you need strategic help.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.129
No. No way. No.
This is a new day, all right?

47:43.240 --> 47:45.402
And Indonesia
is goddamn different.

47:45.520 --> 47:47.727
We can help you get off
the side of that mountain.

47:47.880 --> 47:48.927
I don't need any help

47:49.040 --> 47:51.042
getting off the side
of the goddamn mountain.

47:51.160 --> 47:52.844
I can land this plane.

47:52.960 --> 47:54.041
I can't

47:55.320 --> 47:57.766
Wells came and found me.

47:57.880 --> 47:59.644
I was at a low point,
I have to admit.

47:59.760 --> 48:03.401
It happens in this business,
ups and downs.

48:03.520 --> 48:06.649
But he backed me
with his last cent,

48:06.760 --> 48:09.047
and more than that,
he risked his life,

48:09.160 --> 48:10.889
almost lost it, actually.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.731
It was touch and go there
for a bit.

48:13.840 --> 48:16.650
And now we have the bull
by its horns.

48:16.760 --> 48:18.967
And, boys,
they're big fucking horns.

48:19.120 --> 48:20.531
I've worked with the best,

48:20.640 --> 48:24.008
and I can tell you Kenny Wells
is up there with them.

48:24.120 --> 48:27.124
We're not by any stretch
of the imagination

48:27.240 --> 48:29.527
suggesting at this moment
that anybody take a backseat.

48:29.640 --> 48:31.927
- Just be open to strategic alliances.
- No fucking...

48:32.040 --> 48:33.246
way!

48:37.080 --> 48:38.760
It's a dime out of every one
of my dollars,

48:38.800 --> 48:39.687
not your dollars!

48:39.800 --> 48:41.165
I said no a second ago.

48:41.280 --> 48:42.691
You want to invest?
We got the gold.

48:42.800 --> 48:44.216
We can talk about it.

48:44.240 --> 48:45.969
Don't need a fucking partner.
I know that.

48:46.080 --> 48:48.447
You know,
there's something about...

48:48.560 --> 48:50.961
finding gold...

48:51.080 --> 48:53.401
that is so difficult
to put into words.

48:56.160 --> 48:57.730
It's real difficult.

48:59.680 --> 49:02.126
Taste of it on your tongue.

49:02.240 --> 49:04.720
The feel of it
between your fingers,

49:04.840 --> 49:07.081
it's... it's electric.

49:09.120 --> 49:11.327
It's like a drug,

49:11.440 --> 49:13.761
'cause it hooks you.

49:13.880 --> 49:17.043
And it's precisely what you're
missing here in the city.

49:17.160 --> 49:19.480
It's what makes it so hard for
us to have this conversation

49:19.520 --> 49:22.126
because you have never felt it.

49:23.600 --> 49:26.809
So I have a proposal for you.

49:26.920 --> 49:28.843
Put together
your institutional players,

49:28.960 --> 49:32.328
the guys who rep the big money.

49:32.440 --> 49:35.489
Whoever needs to kick
the tires on this thing.

49:35.600 --> 49:38.809
I will take them
on a little trip up the river.

49:40.640 --> 49:43.644
So... it was Acosta

49:43.760 --> 49:46.127
who proposed
the-the junket in Kensana?

49:46.240 --> 49:48.811
Or did you cook that up
together?

49:48.960 --> 49:51.486
Oh, Jennings, you're...
you're not getting it.

49:51.600 --> 49:55.446
Look, we-we didn't feel like
we had to cook up anything.

49:55.560 --> 49:57.847
I mean, I had people
coming at me from all sides.

49:57.960 --> 49:59.769
My-my neighbor, Hart Hubbard,

49:59.880 --> 50:01.769
he's a lawn care professional.

50:01.880 --> 50:04.008
Usually only worried about
Kay's mulberry tree

50:04.120 --> 50:05.531
leaning over
the back of his fence,

50:05.640 --> 50:07.881
but now
he's dropping mining terms.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.810
"Hey, Kenny, how's the grade
purity over there at Kensana?

50:10.920 --> 50:13.605
I hear it's great.
How about the core frequency?"

50:13.720 --> 50:16.166
Hart fucking Hubbard.
He mows grass for a living.

50:16.320 --> 50:18.656
- We interviewed Mr. Hubbard.
- What I'm saying is we didn't

50:18.680 --> 50:20.080
think we needed
to cook up anything.

50:20.120 --> 50:21.326
Everybody wanted in.

50:21.440 --> 50:24.284
So it was Acosta who proposed
the banker junket?

50:30.960 --> 50:32.530
Yes.

50:34.920 --> 50:36.729
It was a genius move.

50:36.840 --> 50:39.320
Now, you get outside,

50:39.440 --> 50:42.523
stick close to me
and hang on to your wallets.

50:46.920 --> 50:48.843
Come on, come on.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

50:48.960 --> 50:50.656
Back, back, back, back, back,
back, back, back, back.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.409
There he is.

50:52.520 --> 50:55.763
Gentlemen, Mike Acosta.

50:55.880 --> 50:57.370
Glen.

50:57.480 --> 50:58.811
Acosta.

50:58.920 --> 50:59.921
- Bobby.
- Acosta.

51:00.040 --> 51:01.371
Jeff Jackson.

51:01.480 --> 51:03.608
If any one of you
wants to turn back,

51:03.720 --> 51:05.085
this is your chance.

51:06.200 --> 51:07.486
What's that?

51:09.440 --> 51:11.522
He's just messing with you.
Welcome to Indo, boys.

51:12.760 --> 51:14.000
<i>When we got the hit,</i>

51:14.120 --> 51:16.122
we stepped out
in a radiating pattern

51:16.240 --> 51:19.244
and we kept going until
we had the definitive picture.

51:19.360 --> 51:21.886
We're mapping
the underlying geology.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.561
The cores are cut into
sections, and then crushed.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.685
They are then bagged and sealed.

51:29.800 --> 51:33.691
This cage is guarded 24/7.

51:33.800 --> 51:36.849
Under guard, the samples
are sent down river

51:36.960 --> 51:39.327
to independent labs
in Kalimantan.

51:39.440 --> 51:41.568
If a seal is broken
or damaged in any way,

51:41.680 --> 51:44.763
the lab, by law, has to discard
the entire sample.

51:44.880 --> 51:46.723
Every safeguard
has been put in place

51:46.840 --> 51:48.808
to assure the security
of the process.

51:48.920 --> 51:52.686
Diamond-tipped saw blades,
rock crushers.

51:52.800 --> 51:55.280
Core samples being ripped
from the guts of the Earth.

51:55.400 --> 51:57.289
It all sounds great, but...

51:59.440 --> 52:01.681
you boys want to see some gold.

52:07.040 --> 52:09.566
No one's going to believe
this shit.

52:09.680 --> 52:11.284
So, what do you think?

52:13.200 --> 52:14.964
Not sure. What about you?

52:15.080 --> 52:16.696
Acosta seems to know
what he's talking about,

52:16.720 --> 52:18.688
but, uh, I don't know.

52:20.400 --> 52:22.801
Hey. Hey.

52:22.920 --> 52:24.081
Come here, come here.

52:24.240 --> 52:25.765
I think I...
I think I got something.

52:40.320 --> 52:41.446
See this?

52:42.480 --> 52:43.686
Few more like this,

52:43.800 --> 52:46.007
you can pave Wall Street.

52:49.920 --> 52:51.576
<i>When Jackson
pulled that nugget out,</i>

52:51.600 --> 52:52.931
<i>we had 'em.</i>

52:53.040 --> 52:55.008
<i>Brown, Thomas is proud</i>

52:55.120 --> 52:58.442
to announce the public offering
of 27 million shares

52:58.560 --> 53:00.801
of class A common stock

53:00.920 --> 53:03.685
and the initial listing
of Washoe Mining

53:03.800 --> 53:05.928
on the New York Stock Exchange!

53:09.080 --> 53:12.289
We're all going to make
a lot of fucking money!

53:17.880 --> 53:19.723
Welcome to the
Waldorf Astoria, ma'am.

53:21.560 --> 53:23.767
We'll get your bags
right upstairs.

53:44.120 --> 53:45.963
Kenny?

53:46.080 --> 53:47.605
Are you here?

53:51.000 --> 53:52.411
Baby?

53:52.520 --> 53:54.249
Where are you?

53:58.600 --> 53:59.600
Ah.

54:00.920 --> 54:01.967
Oh, my goodness.

54:02.080 --> 54:03.206
You surprised?

54:03.320 --> 54:04.765
Yeah.

54:06.520 --> 54:08.204
It's your favorite flower,
right?

54:10.880 --> 54:11.880
Babe.

54:13.280 --> 54:15.681
You look beautiful, Kay.

54:15.800 --> 54:17.723
Come here.

54:17.840 --> 54:20.525
I have missed you so much.

54:20.640 --> 54:23.120
You have no idea.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.162
Are these the softest sheets
you've ever felt?

54:32.280 --> 54:34.328
- Yeah, you know, I think they are.
- Yeah.

54:34.440 --> 54:37.250
- You want to get under 'em?
- Yeah.

54:53.120 --> 54:54.610
Oh, hello, men.

54:54.720 --> 54:55.920
Everyone, meet the lovely Kay.

54:55.960 --> 54:57.216
- Brian. -Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

54:57.240 --> 54:58.605
- Hollis. Kay.
- Hi.

54:58.720 --> 54:59.920
- Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.331
- Stanton, you know.
- Hey.

55:01.480 --> 55:04.211
The only man in this business
that sweats as much as I do.

55:04.360 --> 55:06.328
All right, let's do this, huh?

55:06.440 --> 55:08.169
Ah, there he is.

55:08.320 --> 55:09.890
Mike Acosta, the one and only.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.207
Mike, meet Kay.

55:12.320 --> 55:14.641
Two of my favorite people
in the world.

55:14.760 --> 55:17.411
You know this one stole
my watch to go meet you.

55:17.520 --> 55:18.776
- You stole her watch?
- Oh, no, no, no. -No...

55:18.800 --> 55:20.016
- I'm just teasing.
- She's just teasing.

55:20.040 --> 55:21.256
- No, you're not.
- No, she's not.

55:21.280 --> 55:22.441
No, I'm not.

55:22.560 --> 55:24.562
I didn't know what time it...
I got to go.

55:24.680 --> 55:26.842
It's so good to meet you, Mike.

55:26.960 --> 55:29.120
- You must be very proud.
- Never doubted for a second.

55:33.040 --> 55:35.247
Here we go!
Five!

55:35.360 --> 55:37.283
Four! Three!

55:37.400 --> 55:39.926
Two! One!

55:40.920 --> 55:44.003
Yeah... baby!

55:44.120 --> 55:46.122
I'm ringing the bell, baby!

55:57.880 --> 56:00.690
<i>In the story we've
been following very closely,</i>

56:00.800 --> 56:01.926
<i>Washoe Mining</i>

56:02.040 --> 56:03.610
may be the stock of the year.

56:03.720 --> 56:04.926
<i>On their first day</i>

56:05.040 --> 56:07.930
on the New York Stock Exchange,
Washoe Mining

56:08.040 --> 56:10.805
<i>turned into a rocket ship today.</i>

56:16.120 --> 56:18.930
- Hi. Great to meet you.
- Kenny. Mike. Come.

56:23.720 --> 56:25.484
Oh.

56:25.600 --> 56:26.886
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.321
This and the money
are in the genes.

56:39.040 --> 56:40.720
How are you? Kenny Wells.
Good to meet you.

56:54.920 --> 56:56.968
True fucking story.

56:58.400 --> 57:00.402
Who at this table wants
to know the secret

57:00.560 --> 57:02.324
to winning bets at pro football?

57:02.480 --> 57:04.216
- What's that?
- Take the east coast team

57:04.240 --> 57:05.685
every fucking time.
You know why?

57:05.800 --> 57:09.407
The west coast team... to them,
they're playing after midnight.

57:29.080 --> 57:30.923
- Rachel Hill.
- Mm.

57:31.040 --> 57:32.690
- Giants fan.
- Kenny Wells, Rachel.

57:32.840 --> 57:34.120
So, what do you do, Rachel Hill?

57:34.160 --> 57:35.810
- Investor relations.
- Mm.

57:35.920 --> 57:37.490
Brown, Thomas.
On the team.

57:37.640 --> 57:39.927
Cheers to that. You got to be
the best-looking one

57:40.040 --> 57:41.963
on the team, I'll tell you that.

57:44.480 --> 57:45.720
It's like a drunk raccoon

57:45.760 --> 57:47.285
got a hold of the Hope diamond.

57:47.440 --> 57:49.044
You don't want to get too close,

57:49.160 --> 57:51.000
but you're not going
to let it get away either.

57:52.040 --> 57:53.929
- It's your raccoon.
- Mm.

57:54.040 --> 57:56.361
You let it run a
multi-billion-dollar company?

57:56.480 --> 57:57.680
What, and lose you as a client

57:57.720 --> 57:59.370
and half the rest
of my business?

57:59.480 --> 58:00.811
There's risks and there's risks.

58:00.920 --> 58:03.127
Still, it was
a good fucking day.

58:03.240 --> 58:05.607
Now, who wants
to buy me a drink?

58:05.720 --> 58:07.324
Three double shots of Jack.

58:07.440 --> 58:10.410
So tell me, to go out
into the wilderness

58:10.520 --> 58:12.807
with your bare hands

58:12.920 --> 58:16.367
and discover something
that everybody wants...

58:18.440 --> 58:20.408
how does that feel?

58:20.520 --> 58:22.841
I, uh... propose a toast.

58:22.960 --> 58:24.849
Hear, hear.

58:24.960 --> 58:28.282
To a small creature,
often misunderstood.

58:33.320 --> 58:34.970
To the raccoon.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.002
Well, fuck me.

58:54.480 --> 58:56.005
River of gold.

58:57.600 --> 58:59.523
The thing is,
if you don't watch it,

58:59.680 --> 59:01.170
gold will grow on you.

59:04.240 --> 59:06.163
- I can see that now.
- Mm.

59:08.080 --> 59:09.496
- I don't want to talk about it.
- What did...

59:09.520 --> 59:10.851
I wasn't doing anything.

59:10.960 --> 59:12.962
I said I don't want
to talk about it!

59:13.080 --> 59:15.003
Well, what the fuck
should I have done, huh?

59:15.120 --> 59:16.616
Just bend her over the table
right there

59:16.640 --> 59:17.976
and fucking banged her
in front of everybody?

59:18.000 --> 59:19.490
You are too drunk
to get it up anyway.

59:19.600 --> 59:21.682
I'll take that challenge, baby.

59:21.800 --> 59:25.805
I don't care about you flirting
with Miss Pneumatic 1988.

59:25.920 --> 59:27.840
You think I haven't seen
that shit before, Kenny?

59:27.880 --> 59:29.370
She had tiny
little fucking titties.

59:29.480 --> 59:30.766
You don't think they were real?

59:30.920 --> 59:34.083
No, none of this is real.
None of it.

59:34.200 --> 59:35.361
Why are you fucking...

59:35.480 --> 59:37.084
We made it!

59:37.200 --> 59:40.090
- Shit.
- Baby, what the fuck?!

59:45.440 --> 59:47.568
You know what
your problem is, Kay?

59:49.200 --> 59:52.044
- No. Why don't you tell me.
- You've got no vision.

59:52.160 --> 59:53.844
Right? Fucking vision.

59:53.960 --> 59:56.176
Your vision starts right here,
and it goes to right here.

59:56.200 --> 59:57.696
Right here
is the fucking kitchen sink,

59:57.720 --> 59:59.563
and right here's
the goddamn parking lot

59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.967
at the furniture store.

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.560
- Come on.
- You mean an actual job

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.682
that would support a person
in the place they live?

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.165
You mean that vision?

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.560
You know what? Fuck you.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.967
- Ah, Kay, fuck me.
- Fuck you.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.376
Fuck you. Fuck...
Wh-wh-what, what?

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.210
Don't you see
what's happening here?

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.400
Oh, great. Go...
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.528
Pack your shit, run back
to your shitty life, huh?

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:24.120
- You know what? I like my shitty life.
- Christ.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.368
- It's mine.
- Fucking giving this up.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.006
You always wanted
a broken bird, didn't you?

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.565
Said the right things,
but in here,

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.842
you never fucking believed
in me, did you?

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.642
You never believed in me,
did you, Kay?

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.445
Hmm? You like me losing,
don't you?

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.536
- How can you even say that?
- It makes you feel comfortable,

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.176
doesn't it?
Does it feel comfortable, Kay?

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:48.761
These people are using you.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.486
- They don't care about you.
- I don't fucking...

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.568
And they certainly
don't believe in you.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.967
- Yeah, but, Kay, I found gold.
- Goddamn...

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.241
Now we're winning, babe.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.328
Would you just let me
have the win?

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:03.481
We're winning!

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.566
It ever occur to you
that I know what I'm doing?

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.841
I hope you do.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.450
Huh?

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:15.560
I do.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.925
- I love what's in there...
- Mm.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.849
More than you'll ever know.

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:28.361
These guys are going
to tear you up.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.331
Mm.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.284
Don't ask me to watch
what happens next.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.562
I know what I'm doing, Kay.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.523
I know what I'm fucking doing.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.681
What'd you do next, Wells?

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.921
What did I do?

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.291
I rode it.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.526
I rode it, Jennings.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.376
Another double.
Seagram's on the rocks.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.164
Yes, sir.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.480
And I'll have the same.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.725
Oh, goddamn.
You don't have to impress me.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:31.730
Reminds me of my childhood.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.763
So how is everything

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:37.327
in the very enchanted world
of Kenny Wells?

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.767
I feel like a million bucks,

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.247
only a few hundred times better.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.721
That must be
a very nice feeling.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.002
Yeah.
It looks like there's a...

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:50.283
a few other people around here
with a similar feeling.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.323
Mm, maybe.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:55.410
Maybe not.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.361
How does someone
like yourself end up, uh, here?

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.289
I know Tom.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.640
Tom is a friend.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.802
- Oh, I bet he is.
- Now, now.

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:11.730
I stay with his cousin,
Timmy, down the lane.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.125
Timmy's really quite
a character,

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.765
if you get to know him.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.405
I don't know Timmy.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.241
I don't really
feel like talking.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.131
Let's just feel things.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.363
Wells.

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.571
- Kenny Wells?
- Uh-huh.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.205
Mark Hancock.

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:42.403
Seems I've caught you at a bit
of a disadvantage, Mr. Wells.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:45.891
Depends on how you look at it.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.002
Kenny goddamn Wells, Mark.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.202
This is Rachel.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.336
Oh, I know the lovely Rachel.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.169
You know,
this son of a bitch here,

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:56.329
he controls more gold than
anybody on the goddamn planet.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.762
With the possible exception now
of Mr. Wells.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.369
This is how it happens, huh?

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.968
This is how it happens.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.526
Goddamn.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.290
<i>What can I tell you?</i>

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.096
- Kenny, it's a generous offer.
- It's a fucking joke!

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.246
Let's-let's take this...

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.931
This isn't a deal, Brian.
This is a goddamn rape.

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:38.281
- Listen... listen to me.
- No, no, this is mine!

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.402
It's mine! I-I found it!

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.483
Me and Mike.
We were the ones up to our ass

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.331
in the mud and the shit
and the malaria.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.881
And this little prick
offers a minority partnership?

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.736
Kenny, let's keep
some perspective here, okay?

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.683
Whenever anybody offers
this amount of money,

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.926
it's a good day.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.405
You may say yes, you may say no,

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.256
but it's not like anybody's
trying to offend you.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.800
Well, mission
goddamn not accomplished.

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.683
Hancock and Newport Holdings
have the expertise

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.529
and the experience
to bring this home.

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.416
- This was always there
as a contingency. -No, no.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.363
- You know that.
- No, no, no.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.687
This is when Washoe Mining
becomes a player,

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.330
right here, right fucking now.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.886
Not Mark fucking Hancock
and Newport Holdings.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.522
I don't even see our name
on here, Brian.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.170
You took our fucking name...

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.647
you took my name off it.

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:22.206
But if we take a step back here,

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.049
wouldn't it not be terrible

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.003
to sit back
and enjoy your success?

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.724
"Wouldn't it not be terrible"?

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:30.127
What the fuck kind of way
of talking is that, Brian?

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.685
W-W-Wouldn't it not be terrible

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.016
if I bend over
and grab my ankles

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.088
so you could fuck me up the ass?

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.402
You think you can buy me out
and take my name?

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.568
Or just throw Kenny Wells
to the fucking cornfield?

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.648
Fuck you, Brian.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.286
If we hit pause for a second

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:47.802
and consider, without emotion,

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.450
I think you'll realize

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:52.325
that this is one of those
very rare moments

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:55.808
where, with a stroke of a pen,
no one in your family...

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.968
I'm talking your children's
grandchildren...

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:01.368
Will ever have to worry
about money again.

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.166
You see these hands, Brian?

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:31.284
These are my father's hands.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.368
I have scratched and clawed
through the hot earth

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.811
with these hands,

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:38.481
and I will bury you
with these hands.

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:45.002
Now, you go tell that silky
sable, Mark Hancock...

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.771
he works for Kenny Wells.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.645
My fucking day.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.410
My day!

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.731
You know,
I almost respect this guy.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.016
That was a pretty foolish

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.530
business decision, wasn't it?

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:11.484
You're a foot away
from living in your car.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:15.047
You turned down $300 million?

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:16.650
Over naming rights?

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.850
Yeah, I did.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:28.482
Because Kensana would become
a Newport Mine, right?

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.887
And Mark fucking Hancock's
Midas touch continues.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.331
Me, Kenny Wells,

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.164
the-the lucky bastard
who fell down drunk

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.641
and woke up
in a pile of cash. No.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.087
It was my dream.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.329
I dreamed it.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:52.807
You sell your dream...

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.122
what do you have left?

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.804
Good morning, Stacy.
How are you today?

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.285
- Good.
- How's Ronnie? Good?

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:42.970
- Thank you.
- Okay. Mm. -Kenny.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.206
Mike's on the line. Come on.

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:45.975
- Mike, hang on. Kenny...
Kenny's here. -Come on!

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.321
- It's Mike.
It's a fucking shit-storm. -Mm.

01:08:48.439 --> 01:08:49.930
Mikey, what's up?

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.087
They're locking us out.

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.576
- They're what?
- They're locking us out!

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.647
The military's here.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:54.920
They're taking over the mine.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.207
What happened at your meeting
with Hancock?

01:08:57.359 --> 01:08:58.885
What happened
at the meeting, Kenny?!

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.685
Listen, Mike, they-they
were trying to push us out.

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.768
Push us out? Wha-What
do you mean, push us out?

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.008
They took... they took
our names off it, Mike.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.447
Mine and yours. They took
our fucking names off.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.005
Aw, you fucking moron!

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.850
They can't... can't just revoke
the-the permit, all right?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:14.841
They can't just steal it away.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.176
Kenny, what?
What the fuck is going on?

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.656
Of course
they can revoke the permit!

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.488
Suharto can do
whatever the fuck he wants!

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.283
Hey! Hey!

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.682
- Mike!
- Kenny, what's going on?

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.529
- What the fuck is going on?
- Shh!

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.801
- Mike. Mike.
- Kenny, we lost the site.

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:33.206
I told you, man.

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:35.448
You knew exactly
who we were dealing with.

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.688
These people are killers.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.928
Hancock first among them.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.327
I told you, Kenny.

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:45.683
- Now it's gone.
- Uh...

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.081
<i>So it turns out that in addition</i>

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.282
<i>to having, um, longstanding ties</i>

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:00.845
with Suharto...

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.566
Newport Holdings
actually had on its board

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.570
a certain ex-president
of the United States.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.882
Who was also...

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.446
in one of Suharto's weddings...

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.045
as a groomsman.

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.083
So you see, that whole time
they're telling me

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.964
how rich my grandkids
are gonna be,

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.411
they got a backup plan.

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.807
They're gonna pick my pocket
and steal it all away.

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.481
<i>Washoe stock
was off nearly 50 points</i>

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.250
<i>at the opening bell this morning</i>

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.966
<i>on news of the Suharto
government's revocation</i>

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.560
<i>of Washoe's exploration rights.</i>

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:49.564
<i>President and CEO,
Kenny Wells, has not...</i>

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.166
All fucking con men.
They stole it's what they did.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.691
They goddamn stole it.

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.006
Mm.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.048
You're gonna need
to go home, Kenny.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.162
Just pour me
a goddamn drink, Roy.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.288
Go home, Kenny.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:18.481
<i>This is us.</i>

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:19.965
<i>We can't get to the phone...</i>

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.810
Wrong number.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.246
This is us.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.203
We can't get to the phone
right now.

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.731
You know what to do.

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:42.249
Hey, hey, Kay.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.771
It's me. Uh...

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.761
I-I-I-I guess you're not home,

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.041
you know, right now.

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.841
I was...
and I was just calling...

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.884
Honey, I really...
I want to hear your voice.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.125
I s... I-I screwed up, Kay.

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:08.650
I want...
I wanted to build something.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.446
Something real
that would last...

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:15.245
last for you and me and...

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.601
for Dad.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.163
That's all I wanted to do.

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.888
But you were right, you know?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.889
You were right.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.685
Again.

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.208
I love you, Kay.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.651
Mm, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna stop now.

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.649
I'm-I'm not gonna call...

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:51.167
I'm not gonna call you anymore.

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.091
Oh, my God, is that him?

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:58.202
Yeah, that's Acosta.

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.971
He looks different in person.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.651
Isn't he supposed to be
in Indonesia?

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.244
Where is he?

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.771
Here you are.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:21.291
Get up!

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.416
You don't own my fucking
company just 'cause you...

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.136
Quit fucking kicking me.

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:29.209
I didn't know who it was till
I heard the cocky fucking talk.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.084
- Ah?
- Fucking moron.

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.009
Oh, yeah?
You're gonna fight?

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.884
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
Yeah, you want to fight?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.411
Yeah, you want to fight now?

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.170
After losing my fucking company?

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.442
You want to fight now?
Yeah, you want to fight?

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.171
Yeah? Yeah?

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.921
You know what they say?

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.287
That you're a drunk.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.528
A clown.

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.881
Out of your league.

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:10.531
Yeah, well, fuck them.

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.085
Yeah, fuck them.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.565
You know what? Fuck you, too.

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:15.967
You think I want to hear
from the fucking golden boy

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:17.570
standing there
in his golden glow

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.326
telling me how messed up
everything is? Huh?

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.090
No, go fucking back
to your perch

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.123
at the Jakarta Palace, huh?

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.969
Huh? You can use
that instinct of yours

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:28.003
to find some new strike
with some new people.

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.487
Is that what you think?

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:34.047
I know you, man.
You're Mike fucking Acosta.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:37.563
Prick.

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.405
Okay.

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:46.561
Let me tell you
what really happened.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.605
We're in North Sulawesi.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.087
Monsoon season.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.089
It's 1980.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.361
Yeah.

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:00.211
The famous copper strike.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.687
Only we was looking for bauxite.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.048
On my way to...
where I'm planning to drill,

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:13.128
I get us stuck.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.121
Five feet of mud.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:20.011
We're just sitting in the rain
day after day,

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.128
watching the metal rust.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:28.444
What'd you do?

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.449
Under the theory
that it's better

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.642
to do something
than nothing, I...

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.684
reported... this was the spot.

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.522
Nowhere became somewhere.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.288
The place you got stuck.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.768
I got lucky.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.041
I fucking love that.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:06.723
You went looking for bauxite,
and you found copper.

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:12.489
I went looking for gold and...

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.682
found a friend.

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.809
That is the single hokiest thing

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:22.321
I've ever heard in my life.

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:27.443
$0, you got a plan?

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.329
Don't you?

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.849
<i>So, get this.</i>

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:45.248
<i>Turns out Suharto had a son,</i>

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.488
<i>his youngest, Darmadi,</i>

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.364
<i>AKA Danny.</i>

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:52.529
<i>Bit of a screw-up,
real problem for the old man.</i>

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:55.883
<i>Mm, safe to say
we understood each other.</i>

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.641
<i>So, Suharto had been trying
to get Danny set up for years,</i>

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:02.326
<i>all right, but everything
Danny touched turned to shit.</i>

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.205
<i>Now, I figure
if we can bring Danny on board</i>

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.322
<i>as a partner,
maybe he could get Daddy</i>

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:10.046
<i>to change his mind
and swing things back our way.</i>

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.731
<i>Now, it was a Hail Mary
from our own one-yard line,</i>

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.569
<i>but it was all we had.</i>

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.125
<i>But it also didn't hurt</i>

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.004
<i>that Danny
had been regularly ignored</i>

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:20.646
<i>by a certain ex-president
of the United States</i>

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.047
<i>who was a groomsman
at his father's third wedding</i>

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:27.250
<i>and also happened to sit on
the board at Newport Holdings.</i>

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.931
So, this guy goes
to a Cadillac dealership.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.656
Right? Dealer comes out
and he says, "Sir,

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:33.216
are you thinking
about buying a Cadillac?"

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.242
He says, "No. I'm
definitely buying a Cadillac.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.328
"What I'm thinking about...

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.249
is pussy."

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.322
Pussy.

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:52.447
Mm. Oh, shit.

01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:59.650
Cadillac is...

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:01.922
Pussy magnet.

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:03.849
You like Cadillacs.

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.200
Yeah!

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:12.242
Hey! Heads up, right there. Oh!

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:14.089
Ah...

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.202
I gotta ride shotgun.

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.561
Ha-ha!

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.964
<i>President Gerald Ford,</i>

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.686
- a tall man.
- Mm-hmm.

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:31.848
George H.W. Bush...

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:34.440
a very tall man.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.886
Mm-hmm.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.048
Mark Hancock...

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.605
also tall man.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.484
My father...

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.329
small man.

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.568
Small in stature.

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.287
But... he loves his family.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.650
Mine, too.

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.649
Yeah.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:58.526
Died in the driveway bringing
in the groceries for my mother.

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:00.085
His heart.

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:04.211
Fuck, well, it makes sense, huh?

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:05.810
To father of Wells.

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:09.089
85/15 Split,

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.043
if you have the balls.

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:12.889
50/50, and I might consider it.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.729
That's a fucking deal.

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.729
That's a deal
if you have the balls.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.081
No balls, no deal.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.525
Kenny...

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:25.449
do you have balls?

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.562
- You asking me
if I got fucking balls? -Yeah.

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.045
Fuck, he has balls.

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.168
- Go in there?
- Mm-hmm.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:35.410
Fucking 85/15 fucking split?
- Mm-hmm.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.488
No balls...

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.204
no deal.

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:42.165
Open it.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.290
I'm touching a tiger.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:30.649
I'll pull my cock out,
we go 60/40.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.842
Ah, fuck you.

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:38.689
<i>Mike, I'm touching
a tiger right between the eyes.</i>

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.885
Hollis, what's going on?

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:52.682
You haven't heard?

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.842
Wells cut a deal.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.564
A deal?
What are you talking about?

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:57.926
Who cut a deal with him?

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:01.010
Suharto.
The Indonesian government.

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:04.602
- What? -Washoe retains
15% of the find.

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:07.610
The other 85 goes to a company
of Suharto's choosing,

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:10.963
which just so happens
to be owned by his son.

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.731
- Wells cut us off at the knees.
- What about Hancock?

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:16.081
He's out.
Can't compete at that number.

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:17.571
Deal's done, Brian.

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:20.001
Wells and Acosta are now
the only outside partners

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:22.242
in the biggest gold strike
in history.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.124
We represent exactly none of it.

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.720
- 15% is a terrible deal.
- Is it?

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:29.810
What's 15% of $30 billion?

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.321
I can explain. You met him.

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:33.885
You'll be fine, Brian.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.570
You'll land on your feet.

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:46.841
I was afraid you'd come home
with a bone in your nose

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.880
- or some such shit.
- How are we doing?

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.564
- Good, man.
- Hey, where's Kay?

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.569
- You didn't hear?
- Hear what?

01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:53.841
She quit.

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:55.962
She got a promotion
out at the store.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:59.163
- Assistant manager.
- Hey, Roy, turn that up.

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:01.442
Kenny Wells, right there!
It's on the news, man!

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.324
Massive gold strike,

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.761
fending off a takeover
by Newport Holdings.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:08.451
Washoe shares are soaring...

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.164
Oh, yeah!

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:13.045
Soaring! Soaring!

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:16.323
Kenny!
Can I see you a minute?

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.322
What you got, Clive?

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:23.011
I just got a call.

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:25.088
The National Association
of Prospectors

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.921
is gonna honor you
with the Golden Pickaxe.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.606
- You shittin' me?
- No, I'm not.

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:37.769
You are now the best miner
in the world.

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.963
And I'm sure somewhere
your daddy is smiling.

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:45.804
Well, goddamn, if he's not,
I can smile for the both of us.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.331
Ah...

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:51.049
Where are you going?

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.810
Got to find someone.

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.171
Yeah?

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.446
Mike. I didn't think
you could make it.

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:19.690
Okay,

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:23.287
A thousand monkeys,
thousand horses...

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:24.970
uh...

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.003
and across and around...

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.528
I'm nervous.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.728
You're gonna be okay.

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:10.648
"Every last one of us

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:14.401
"who calls the great state
of Nevada home...

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.881
"arrived here...

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.048
"with a dream.

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:25.286
"It was my great granddad
who came out here on a wagon.

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:29.530
"He had a horse
and he had two mules...

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:31.290
"when they
finally stopped moving

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.209
"and said...

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:37.449
'This is the place."'

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.889
Too much?

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:47.128
That's good.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:52.161
Yeah.

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.601
<i>Our own Kenny Wells!</i>

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:57.690
Get up here, Kenny!

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:24.441
Thank you. Um...

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:31.564
My great granddad...

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:33.529
was one of us.

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:36.570
He came out here in a wagon
with two horses and a mule,

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:39.001
and, you know,
he crossed six states

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:41.168
before he slowed down,
and it was...

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.520
it was when he got here

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:46.804
that he finally pulled
those reins back and said...

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:50.242
"This is the place."

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.083
What is a prospector?

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:00.726
No, no, I'm...

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.444
Seriously, what...

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.048
What is a prospector?

01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:12.563
It's someone who believes...

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:16.167
it's out there.

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:18.521
<i>Who wakes up every morning,</i>

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.530
again and again,
again and again...

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.327
believing it's out there.

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:30.451
And then it's not.

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:33.530
- Right? It's not.
- Mm-hmm. -Mm-hmm.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.406
And he's standing
on the edge of the desert,

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.010
staring a...

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:42.329
<i>new day's sunrise
right in the eye, and...</i>

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:44.807
<i>and he hears that little voice,</i>

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:47.327
<i>a little voice that says...</i>

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:51.568
"Go ahead.

01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:53.927
Keep walking."

01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:56.725
<i>And the sun gets
higher and higher,</i>

01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:58.842
<i>and it's shining down on him,
and he's really hot,</i>

01:28:58.960 --> 01:28:59.960
<i>and he doesn't have</i>

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.280
any water to drink,

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.880
and everybody that came
with him wants to turn back,

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.729
and eventually,
they do turn back,

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.729
and there he is.

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:10.002
And he's all alone.

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.647
With the belief...

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:30.160
that it's out there, man.

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:32.282
It's out there.

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.289
That's a prospector.

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:45.003
That's a prospector.

01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:58.321
Really great speech, son.
Just great. Great.

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:16.047
- To your daddy.
- To Mr. Wells!

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.605
Mm.

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:52.886
Yeah?

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.685
What?

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:00.131
Say-say again?

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:01.765
No, I-I don't understand.

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:03.848
Wait-wait.

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:20.976
Kenny, what's going on?

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.765
Kenny... what happened?

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:24.961
I don't know.

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:27.168
I'm going to find out.

01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:31.288
I don't know any more than...

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:39.245
You're not gonna get away
with this!

01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.164
Back the fuck off!

01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:45.762
Kenny, please fix this!

01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:48.360
What happened, huh?
What happened?

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.010
The independent assayer.

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.043
They couldn't reproduce
Mike's findings.

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:56.528
There's no gold.

01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:59.041
Kenny, there's no goddamn gold.
There never was.

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:04.686
That's not possible.

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.816
The image on the left
is the type of gold

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.605
found in the Washoe samples.
This is river gold.

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.404
<i>Notice how the edges
are rounded,</i>

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:14.966
worn smooth
by the erosion of water.

01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:17.128
What we should have found
is flake gold,

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:18.765
the sample on the right,

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:22.851
<i>pulled directly from the rock,
rough-edged and angular.</i>

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:25.167
That's a pretty darn big detail
to overlook,

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:26.850
wouldn't you say?

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:29.850
It's a big detail, but...
you have to understand,

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:32.930
everything else about
the Washoe samples was right.

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:35.122
But the gold was wrong.

01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:38.164
It's called salting...
It literally means when someone

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:40.971
sprinkles gold dust
into a rock sample,

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:43.845
like you... salt your steak.

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:46.884
<i>It is the oldest trick
in the book.</i>

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.729
<i>Oldest trick in the book?</i>

01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:50.808
And yet major
mining corporations,

01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:52.610
<i>investment banks, the auditors,</i>

01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:54.085
<i>everyone was fooled.</i>

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:56.407
We weren't fooled.

01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:58.409
We just didn't look.

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:00.124
<i>By all appearances,</i>

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.765
<i>Washoe's security protocol</i>

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.245
were ironclad.

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:05.328
But... when the person

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.046
administering the security
is fraudulent,

01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:10.845
the whole system goes down.

01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:18.249
Right. Did he say...

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:20.448
wh-wh-where-where he was going?

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:22.130
Did he mention Jakarta?

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.201
I'll call you back.

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:30.130
The New York Stock Exchange
just suspended trading.

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:33.005
They've taken Washoe
off the board.

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:48.242
You sold some, right?

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:49.600
Yeah.

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:52.087
Of course.

01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:53.725
Bobby

01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:55.888
I thought...

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.924
I thought it was just gonna
keep going up.

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.520
Damn it, Bobby,
I told you from the beginning

01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:04.325
just put some away,
save a little bit just in case.

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:06.329
How many times
did I tell you that?

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:07.771
Kenny, did you know?

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.609
Did you know, Kenny?

01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.563
Did I know?

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.284
I can't believe
you would ask me that.

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.129
I'm asking you that.
Did you know?

01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:18.969
No, I goddamn
didn't know, Bobby.

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.289
Kenny.

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:26.841
- Kenny.
- What?

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:28.056
I don't even know how
to tell you this.

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:29.080
Just look.

01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:35.409
Acosta was dumping stock.

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.085
- Mm.
- Shell companies.

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:39.487
Banks in the Philippines,
the fucking Azores.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.601
Gibraltar.

01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:42.768
Multiple layers, all offshore.

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:46.450
How much?

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:49.689
$164 million.

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:53.486
Okay, uh...

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.409
what are we gonna do?

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.571
I don't fucking
believe this. Hmm?

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:07.888
This is the FBI!

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.321
Step away from your desks!

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:13.364
Take two big steps
away from your desks!

01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.448
Do not touch anything!

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:34.448
<i>How much money
was lost in the fraud,</i>

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:36.403
- that we know of?
- Oh, billions.

01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:37.885
Large institutional investors

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:39.929
- lost billions of dollars.
- So one

01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:41.530
<i>or maybe both of them,</i>

01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:45.964
<i>two outsiders, took everybody
on Wall Street for a ride?</i>

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:47.496
<i>Yeah, it really looks
like they did.</i>

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:49.761
- Yeah.
- And Acosta has vanished?

01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:52.486
With hundreds of millions
of dollars.

01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.008
Kenny Wells has always
maintained his innocence,

01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:58.771
<i>that he was duped
along with everyone else.</i>

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.611
<i>Given that,
what do you make of this?</i>

01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:07.847
Kenny Wells,
a fool or a mastermind?

01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:12.087
<i>It's</i> a <i>very good
question, Roger.</i>

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:33.771
Um...

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:40.409
Mike-Mike Acosta was my friend
and, uh, my partner.

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:41.891
Um...

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:46.004
and he-he betrayed me.

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:49.681
I-I know as CEO
of Washoe Mining

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:51.928
it's my responsibility to know

01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:54.930
everything that's going on,
and I... I didn't.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:58.407
It's not an excuse.

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:00.409
All right?
I sincerely apologize

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:04.161
to everybody and anybody
that lost on their investments.

01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.931
Come on, Mike.

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:12.042
Mikey, come on in, man.

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:14.891
All right?

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.650
What happened, huh?

01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:36.127
- Howard.
- I saw you on TV.

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:39.164
- Hey, man, can I talk to you
for a minute, please? -No.

01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:41.169
Look, I just want to know
where my money went.

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:43.336
- Come on! -Don't know anything
about it, okay? -Mr. Wells,

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:46.204
Mr. Wells, exactly when
will you be departing?

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:49.164
Uh, later. A few days or so.
I'll let you know.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:52.045
- We just need to talk about
your bill, sir. <i>-I'll</i> be down.

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:53.525
We'll settle it up.

01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:00.842
Do I need a lawyer?

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:03.406
Do you need a lawyer?

01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:08.683
Right answer.

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:22.688
<i>How'd you meet Michael Acosta?</i>

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.243
The, uh, first time
or the second time?

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:31.767
How'd you meet him, Wells?

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:36.644
It was April... of '88.

01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:40.727
Yeah, I was
on the balls of my ass.

01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:43.525
Scrambling.

01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:46.803
Not exactly uncharted waters
for me, but...

01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:49.287
I was in deep.

01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:59.010
I think it's pretty unlikely

01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:01.122
we'll ever see
your partner again.

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:06.160
- What are you talking about?
- A lot of very powerful people

01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:08.203
are very angry
at Michael Acosta.

01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:13.690
Well, what happened?

01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:14.881
What happened?

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.685
$17 billion of value
disappeared overnight.

01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:19.086
Mike Acosta
waves good-bye to you

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:21.322
in the ballroom downstairs
and goes back to Indonesia

01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:23.841
<i>on a jet chartered
with Washoe funds.</i>

01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:26.725
<i>And then he does
a disappearing act.</i>

01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:28.888
<i>But this you know.</i>

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:32.408
<i>First, he's locked out
of the assay lab in Kalimantan</i>

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.921
<i>by the minister of the interior.</i>

01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:36.849
<i>- So he goes back to Jakarta...</i>
- Mr. <i>Acosta,</i>

01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:38.371
please walk with with me.

01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:40.369
<i>Where he's immediately detained</i>

01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:42.448
<i>by the Indonesian military.</i>

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:45.445
<i>And they hold him</i>

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:47.682
<i>while they try to reproduce
for themselves</i>

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:50.121
<i>the lab results claimed
by Washoe.</i>

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.604
Which, of course,
they are unable to do.

01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:57.371
Now, at this point,

01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:00.484
either he's being transferred
to an actual prison, or...

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.409
he's bribed one of the officers.

01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:03.567
Either way,

01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:05.284
<i>he's on a military helicopter.</i>

01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:10.163
<i>They fly north, loosely
tracking the Kensana River.</i>

01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:01.810
<i>A thousand feet up,
over the Kensana...</i>

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:04.491
<i>Mike Acosta takes a header.</i>

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:17.805
No way.

01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:20.605
No fucking way.

01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:22.529
He either faked it,

01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:24.802
or he paid to have
this-this bullshit story

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:26.445
you're telling put out.

01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:30.804
$164 million goes a long way
in Indonesia.

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:33.446
They found a body.

01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:51.241
<i>Hands and face were eaten away,</i>

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:54.284
<i>probably by wild pigs.</i>

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.971
Sure this is him?

01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:59.401
I'm not sure of anything...

01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:04.208
<i>except Mike Acosta traded
water filters for river gold.</i>

01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:05.930
<i>But now
the Indonesian government</i>

01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.326
<i>have gone unusually quiet</i>

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:09.090
on the subject.

01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:10.844
There was an autopsy

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:12.962
corroborating the identity
of the body.

01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:16.851
<i>They then sealed the report...</i>

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:20.608
cremated the remains.

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:25.169
Interestingly,
Danny Suharto, your friend...

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:28.170
dumped a lot of stock as well.

01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:31.124
So the Suhartos
are even richer now.

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:34.562
Mike Acosta is ostensibly
dead and buried, and...

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:37.001
$164 million is still missing.

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:40.488
And the only question...

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:42.807
I'm left with is...

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:45.446
whether or not
you were in on it.

01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:49.801
I...

01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:53.242
- I can't believe it.
- Can't believe what?

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:56.921
No, look, th-this business...

01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.651
had written Mike off
years ago, all right?

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:01.171
They called his theories crap.

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.203
But...

01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.163
there's no way.

01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:07.203
He wouldn't, he fucking couldn't

01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:09.448
let this be
the last word on him.

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:13.167
- No fucking way. -You talking
about Acosta or yourself?

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.527
All right, look. We-we-we were
running out of money, right?

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:29.166
And I was practically dying
from malaria.

01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:31.971
I gave Mike
the last dollar to my name.

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:34.765
And I made him promise me
something, I said, "Mike...

01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:38.327
don't let me die out here
for nothing."

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:46.324
A few weeks later,
I came to, and...

01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:48.408
Mike was there.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.082
He said, "We got...

01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:56.362
"we got a strike, Kenny.

01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:00.007
We got a goddamn gold mine."

01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:09.447
And th-there's no way that
he set out to swindle anyone.

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:12.211
He just needed
to buy a little more time.

01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:19.368
And he didn't want
to let me down.

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:23.326
- You're fuckin' lyin'.
- Levine, sit down!

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:25.204
You want to talk
about the truth?

01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:26.890
All right,
let's talk about the truth.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.162
The only truth here is,
when everybody's getting rich,

01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:32.090
nobody gives a shit
about the truth.

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:35.283
Come the fuck on.
All anyone had to do was look,

01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:37.129
open their eyes.

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:40.323
Man, the-the gold was wrong,
the find was too good.

01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:43.011
There were red flags everywhere.

01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:44.770
Why did no one look?

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.848
'Cause no one wanted
to fucking know.

01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:48.849
We all wanted to believe.

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.883
Me, you,
fucking everybody. Why?

01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:55.648
Because we were all making
so much fucking money, man.

01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:58.001
That's the truth.

01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:00.845
That's been going on
for fucking centuries!

01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:05.683
Oh, fuck...

01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:11.291
Were you aware Mike Acosta
was salting

01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:13.801
- the Washoe core samples?
- No.

01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:15.365
You had no knowledge

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.324
<i>Mike Acosta
was perpetrating a fraud?</i>

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:20.807
<i>- No.
- You were not in collusion</i>

01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:23.810
<i>with Mike Acosta
on the Kensana gold strike?</i>

01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:27.845
No, man, I fucking thought
I won the lottery.

01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:31.362
Did you profit
from the Kensana fraud?

01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:36.126
- No. -Did anyone
close to you profit?

01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:40.411
My friends lost money.

01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:42.409
My neighbors lost money.

01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:44.568
Me...

01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:47.251
I lost everything.

01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:52.600
You know
what the truth of it is?

01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:56.202
I never really cared
about money.

01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:59.806
I cared about gold.

01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:02.127
And it's different, Jennings.

01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:04.288
It's fucking different.

01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:26.688
Interview terminated
with Kenny Wells...

01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:29.724
6:45 a.m.,

01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:33.407
October 17, 1988.

01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:34.806
Interview conducted by myself,

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:37.127
Paul K. Jennings,
special agent.

01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:40.403
Also present,
agents Levine and Banks,

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:42.409
Federal Bureau of Investigation,

01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:44.329
district of Nevada, Reno.

01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:58.728
Mr. Kenny Wells...

01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:03.927
you are free to go.

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:08.490
Well, lookee there.

01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:10.841
Somebody believes me.

01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:14.961
I wouldn't go overboard.

01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:18.562
In fact,
I wouldn't leave the state,

01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:21.326
or start buying new stuff
or chartering

01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:23.016
- any more jets.
- I gotta sneak by the guy

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.896
at the front desk 'cause
I can't pay the hotel bill.

01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:27.810
I can't be a party
to that information.

01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:31.167
Good luck, Mr. Wells.

01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:34.250
We'll be keeping an eye on you.

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:42.081
What are you gonna do now,
Wells?

01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:04.845
Hey, Kenny.

01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:06.480
I-I'm still worried
about that mulberry

01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:08.961
- over the back fence.
- Yeah. I know, Hart.

01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:10.804
It's good to see you.

01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:12.809
Good to see you, too, Kenny.

01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:45.562
Can I come in?

01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:24.046
- You want coffee?
- Yeah, sure.

01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:32.207
This place looks great.

01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:38.007
So do you, Kay.

01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:44.330
I made curtains.

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:47.046
From that fabric.

01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:48.491
Hmm.

01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:54.326
Some stuff came for you,
some mail.

01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:44.811
What?

01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:47.526
What is it?
