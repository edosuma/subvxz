WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:06.193
Now nobody's saying the Chatsworth Estate
is the Garden of Eden,

00:06.240 --> 00:08.515
but it's been a good home to us, to me,

00:08.560 --> 00:13.350
Frank Gallagher, and me kids who
l'm proud of, cos every single one of 'em

00:13.400 --> 00:16.358
reminds me a little of me.

00:16.400 --> 00:22.077
They can all think for themselves,
which they've got me to thank for.

00:22.120 --> 00:25.749
Lip, who's a bit of a gobshite, which is why
nobody calls him Phillip any more.

00:25.800 --> 00:30.112
lan, a lot like his mam, which is handy for
the others cos she's disappeared into thin air.

00:30.160 --> 00:34.392
And Carl. We daren't let him
grow his hair for two reasons -

00:34.440 --> 00:37.955
it makes it stand on end and makes him
look like Toyah, and nits love him.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.072
Debbie - sent by God, total angel.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.112
You've to check your change
but she'll go miles out of her way

00:44.160 --> 00:45.832
to do you a favour,

00:45.880 --> 00:48.599
plus lickle Liam,
who's gonna be a star some day.

00:48.640 --> 00:54.272
Sheila, me bird, couldn't be happier.
One plate short of a full set, like.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.471
And fantastic neighbours Kev
and Veronica - lend ya anything,

00:57.520 --> 00:58.873
well, almost anything.

00:58.920 --> 01:03.550
Carol and Marty - the lodgers from hell.
Last of the lonely hearts

01:03.600 --> 01:06.672
and a psychologist's wet dream.
Still, nobody's perfect.

01:06.720 --> 01:11.077
But all of 'em to a man
know first and foremost

01:11.120 --> 01:16.672
one of the most vital necessities in life
is they know how to throw a party!

01:16.720 --> 01:17.948
Heh, heh, heh, scatter!

01:18.000 --> 01:21.709
Come, they told me

01:21.760 --> 01:23.910
Rum-pah-pum-pum...

01:23.960 --> 01:26.918
'Now they say a lie can travel
half way round the world

01:26.960 --> 01:29.349
'while the truth is still putting its boots on,

01:29.400 --> 01:33.109
'which is right,
because lies are our currency.'

01:33.160 --> 01:36.311
Bar's closed for half an hour.

01:38.240 --> 01:40.708
lt's our New Year an' all, you know!

01:40.760 --> 01:43.479
'There's white lies
and there's black lies.'

01:43.520 --> 01:45.033
Ahl Pa-rum-pa-pum-puml

01:45.080 --> 01:49.039
'And then there's the totally
fucking psychedelic ones.

01:49.080 --> 01:51.514
'You know,
the ones that knock you sideways

01:51.560 --> 01:53.551
'because you never saw them coming?'

01:53.600 --> 01:55.716
Dicko! All right, mate.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.593
Here you are, attention, everyone.
Here you are.

01:58.640 --> 02:02.269
Time's upon us now. Synchronise
your watches, here yer are!

02:02.320 --> 02:03.594
Ten, nine...

02:03.640 --> 02:06.996
Here they are! The fruit,
apple of my eye, all four of 'em.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.314
..Five...

02:08.360 --> 02:11.830
l love you like the shepherd loves his flock.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.916
..Three, two, one. Happy New Year!!!

02:20.280 --> 02:25.035
Should auld acquaintance be forgot...

02:39.200 --> 02:43.432
For Auld Lang Syne, my dear...

02:45.920 --> 02:48.957
Eh, New Year's Resolution -

02:49.000 --> 02:50.638
smoke more fags.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.477
20 a day from now on.

02:52.520 --> 02:55.353
And l'm gonna do more
crappy stripagram work

02:55.400 --> 02:59.234
and cut out the exercise.
Might as well set realistic ones, eh?

02:59.280 --> 03:03.717
Eh actually, l've got one for you.

03:03.760 --> 03:08.038
Literature classes. You're always
going on about how you can't read.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.993
Yeah, but school and homework and that.

03:14.040 --> 03:16.474
l don't think so, V.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.637
Unless you wanna be pulling pints
for the rest of your life,

03:19.680 --> 03:21.955
you gotta put the effort in.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.470
RHYTHMlC GROANlNG

03:25.520 --> 03:27.192
Oh, Jesus...

03:27.240 --> 03:28.355
What? What is it?

03:28.400 --> 03:30.960
lt's your mam!

03:31.000 --> 03:32.399
Have you eaten peanuts?

03:32.440 --> 03:34.670
Only a handful to soak up the gin. >

03:34.720 --> 03:35.914
Ah, l'm allergic.

03:35.960 --> 03:39.157
- Shit!
- Well, you could have mentioned it!

03:39.200 --> 03:41.236
Help, somebody!

03:41.280 --> 03:45.114
- What have you done to him?
- He's dying. Anapapleptic...whatsit.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.720
His throat's swollen up.
Get some water, Kev.

03:47.760 --> 03:51.548
Two minutes into the new year
and this happens. lt's a sign.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.956
Should never get involved with
married men. lt's a golden rule.

03:55.760 --> 03:59.594
Please, God.
Don't make this happen to me.

03:59.640 --> 04:04.191
l know l've strayed of recent years,
but l swear, let him live

04:04.240 --> 04:09.155
and l'll come back to you, Lord,
if you just hear me this one special time.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.679
Thank you.

04:13.720 --> 04:17.952
He did it! He heard!

04:22.320 --> 04:25.630
Care to help those less fortunate?

04:25.680 --> 04:29.639
There's nothing more upsetting
than the sight of a sick child.

04:29.680 --> 04:34.071
lt's surprising how generous people can be
when they're three sheets to the wind.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.556
Bless you.

04:37.600 --> 04:41.832
Deborah, you don't know if your parents
received the letters from school

04:41.880 --> 04:44.189
- about your Liam?
- l'm not sure. ls it serious?

04:44.240 --> 04:47.073
Well, it is, l'm afraid.
The Head's talking exclusion.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.271
Liam's behaviour last term became
increasingly disruptive.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.515
The nativity play was the final straw.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.311
Did God send you?

04:55.360 --> 04:57.351
No. God doesn't exist.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.231
He's a made-up person,

04:59.280 --> 05:03.114
and the Bible is all pretend stories
to make people be good.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.230
God's not real?

05:05.280 --> 05:08.352
We're a Catholic foundation for the education
of Catholic children.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.072
Yeah, but he's only five.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.031
Sinners start young, Debbie.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.913
Miss Murdoch and myself
will be doing a home visit,

05:14.960 --> 05:16.712
ten o'clock Monday.

05:16.760 --> 05:20.594
lf you could remind your parents,
l'd be very grateful. Happy New Year.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.313
Happy New Year.

05:23.360 --> 05:27.319
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.511
Cops! Cops! lt's a raid!
Hide your gear.

06:04.560 --> 06:07.711
lt's a raid, they've got sniffers!

06:11.920 --> 06:13.638
lan?

06:13.680 --> 06:17.116
- Not tonight! You can't tonight!
- Says who?

06:17.160 --> 06:18.832
Says decency!

06:18.880 --> 06:23.158
We've reason to believe Class A drugs are
being sold and consumed on these premises.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.191
Course they are, it's New Year's Eve!

06:26.760 --> 06:28.478
ln.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.111
Just checking we had enough ice.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.916
You can arrest me any day!

06:46.280 --> 06:47.349
Get off.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.316
- Fuck off.
- Ow!

06:57.480 --> 07:00.119
Hey, hey! Jesus!
Who trained him to do that?

07:00.160 --> 07:01.434
Yer twisted, fucking...

07:01.480 --> 07:04.472
- Got one here, sarge.
- Get off!

07:04.520 --> 07:07.557
(Woman) Leave him alone.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.875
We'll meet again
Don't know where

07:09.920 --> 07:12.753
Don't know when, sunshine
But l know...

07:35.400 --> 07:37.152
Where'd you get the gear, Frank?

07:37.200 --> 07:39.236
Bashed in bus stop.

07:39.280 --> 07:42.317
Burnage end of Belshaw Lane.

07:42.360 --> 07:46.114
But, but l did not do her over.

07:46.160 --> 07:49.391
She was already dead
when l nabbed the bag,

07:49.440 --> 07:51.271
hence, hence...

07:51.320 --> 07:53.356
did l take the purse?

07:53.400 --> 07:54.913
l did not take the purse.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.996
l left the purse where it was

07:57.040 --> 08:01.955
out of respect for the fact she was
already stiff as a minger's ring.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.030
- ls that cos there was nothing in it?
- Yeah, and she stank of piss!

08:08.080 --> 08:11.436
So that's theft, possession...

08:11.480 --> 08:14.870
debatable whether you had
intent to supply.

08:14.920 --> 08:19.914
Supply? Fucking come off...
Fucking...to who?

08:19.960 --> 08:22.269
lt's not looking good for you, Frank.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.678
lt's not looking good at all.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.797
Unless...

08:30.840 --> 08:34.549
On the go-od ship, lol-li-pop

08:34.600 --> 08:39.230
lt's a sweet trip to the candy shop

08:39.280 --> 08:41.669
Where bon-bons play

08:41.720 --> 08:43.278
On the sunny beach...

08:43.320 --> 08:44.799
Fuck off!

08:44.840 --> 08:46.558
..Of Peppermint Bay.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.152
Oh, he's going! He's going!

09:07.200 --> 09:10.397
Hiya, Debbie. Oh, Happy New Year.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.556
Debatable. ls me dad in?

09:12.600 --> 09:14.079
He hasn't been to bed yet.

09:16.840 --> 09:20.719
Letters from school. Liam's in big trouble.
They're doing a home visit

09:20.760 --> 09:24.230
- and they wanna see one of his parents.
- And?

09:24.280 --> 09:27.192
And you're one of his parents.

09:27.240 --> 09:30.312
Dad, this is serious.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.909
lf he gets expelled we'll have social workers
sniffing all over us.

09:33.960 --> 09:35.598
What do you want me to do?

09:35.640 --> 09:38.473
Promise you'll be at ours. Monday.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.397
- Nine thirty, sharp.
- l promise.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.351
Promise me you won't forget.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.198
Cross my heart and hope to...

09:46.480 --> 09:49.597
We've ran out of sprite
so l've done you a vodka.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.198
Here ya are.

09:58.480 --> 10:02.155
lt's your serotonin, winter blues.
Everyone gets a bit down in January.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.317
Or it could be the fact that l'm bored,
knackered and skint.

10:05.360 --> 10:08.113
- Try eating.
- l don't want to eat.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.396
Didn't know you was going away.

10:13.440 --> 10:18.116
- Spiritual retreat. Purifying my sinful soul.
- What brought this on?

10:18.160 --> 10:22.233
The road to Damascus, except for me
it was the ladies lavatory.

10:22.280 --> 10:26.637
l'm just a lonely woman searching
for love and He understands that.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.114
When l needed Him, God listened.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.072
- God doesn't exist!
- Liam!

10:32.120 --> 10:33.712
He isn't real.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.113
Get up, come on.

10:35.160 --> 10:38.232
You're the only one that'll miss me.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.271
Ah! l've got nits!

10:40.320 --> 10:44.199
Bloody nits! Jesus!
Can things get any worse?

10:44.240 --> 10:46.037
(Liam) No God. No God.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.832
There's no God.

10:47.880 --> 10:51.668
Liam, listen to me and listen good.
You can't keep saying that about God.

10:51.720 --> 10:54.757
- Why not?
- Because it upsets people.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.712
Don't say it any more, OK. Never again.

10:57.760 --> 11:02.470
And when them nice people from school come
on Monday, you've got to be a very good boy.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.351
Do you understand?

11:27.920 --> 11:30.309
Sheila, it's Debbie. ls my dad there?

11:30.360 --> 11:33.557
l think he's gone down with the flu.
Do you want me to get him to call you?

11:33.600 --> 11:34.794
Forget it!

11:42.040 --> 11:45.396
There's nothing more upsetting
than the sight of a sick child.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.070
Don't want nits now, do we?

12:19.760 --> 12:21.751
Come in.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.351
Did you have a nice Christmas?

12:29.400 --> 12:32.233
- Yes, thank you.
- Er, would you like a cup of tea?

12:32.280 --> 12:36.239
Er, No, we're fine, thanks. We just need
a quick chat with your mum and dad

12:36.280 --> 12:37.872
and then we'll be on our way.

12:37.920 --> 12:41.469
My mum and dad can't make it today.
They send their apologies.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.839
l'm afraid that won't do.

12:42.880 --> 12:46.475
Three letters have been sent and not
a single one's been responded to.

12:46.520 --> 12:50.433
The whole point of a home visit is so
we can openly discuss our grievances.

12:50.480 --> 12:54.951
The school Governors take a very strong line
on parental responsibility.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.788
Where are they?
l mean, why have they left this to you?

12:58.840 --> 13:00.478
Surely you should be in school.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.637
What exactly's going on here, Deborah?

13:03.680 --> 13:07.309
Well, the thing is, they've a lot on
their plates at the minute.

13:07.360 --> 13:10.033
And it's all got really difficult for them,

13:10.080 --> 13:14.358
with the hospital visits
and getting time off work.

13:14.400 --> 13:18.473
lt's not fair, none of it seems fair.

13:36.160 --> 13:40.392
l'll speak to the teachers,
and l'll make sure they're made fully aware.

13:40.440 --> 13:44.035
Can you ask them not to mention it
to Karen, his half-sister?

13:44.080 --> 13:47.516
She picks him up after school.
She's inconsolable.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.232
Cancer is a terrible thing.

13:49.280 --> 13:52.716
You don't think it's God's way of punishing
him?

13:52.760 --> 13:56.309
No, Debbie, you mustn't torture yourself
with such thoughts.

14:04.400 --> 14:08.439
So here it is, merry Christmas

14:08.480 --> 14:12.473
Everybody's having fun...

14:12.520 --> 14:15.239
lf l hear that song one more time,
l'm gonna chin some fucker.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.236
Oh, Jez,

14:17.280 --> 14:20.397
tonight am l still good for them
couple of hours off?

14:20.440 --> 14:23.637
- ls this gonna be a regular thing?
- l'm learning to read, Jez.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.398
lt's not gonna happen overnight.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.032
Well, read my lips.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.832
l'm running a pub, not a library.

14:28.880 --> 14:34.398
lf you want time off, find someone to cover
your shifts. Preferably young, sexy and female.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.518
Problem solved.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.278
..Granny always tell you...

14:42.800 --> 14:46.793
House full of kids,
you're bound to get the odd nit.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.558
lt's fucking disgusting.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.956
You know your trouble?
You're too clean.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.675
lf you're going out with our Marty,
you have to let your standards drop.

14:55.720 --> 14:59.190
When we were kids, he used to wear
Y-fronts for that long,

14:59.240 --> 15:00.992
we'd have to incinerate 'em.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.190
Maybe that's where the arson started.

15:04.760 --> 15:07.513
- lt won't crack, you know.
- What won't?

15:07.560 --> 15:08.913
Your face.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.269
l'm depressed.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.151
You've food in your belly,

15:13.200 --> 15:16.715
clothes on your back and a bloke
that worships the ground you walk on.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.318
What's the problem?

15:19.840 --> 15:21.478
l don't know...

15:23.440 --> 15:25.476
You need sunshine.

15:27.040 --> 15:31.397
And how am l gonna get that, Marty,
in the middle of fucking winter?

15:31.440 --> 15:34.273
Unless you've got a spare grand
to whisk me off to Rio.

15:35.480 --> 15:38.119
No. But l'm gonna make you happy.

15:45.920 --> 15:48.878
- Hiya, Kev.
- Hiya, Debbie.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.069
Start talking.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.348
What?

16:02.400 --> 16:06.712
- l told you to leave that on.
- Debbie, what the fuck have you done?

16:06.760 --> 16:07.795
Nothing.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.593
Bullshit. The school think he's ill.
Worse than ill.

16:10.640 --> 16:13.837
One of the teachers has just started
crying on my shoulder.

16:13.880 --> 16:17.190
Well, she had no right.
l specifically told her not to mention it!

16:17.240 --> 16:19.879
Are you mental?
What the fuck you playing at?

16:19.920 --> 16:22.593
You can't go around telling people that...

16:22.640 --> 16:25.871
- Liam, mate, go and get in the bath.
- Don't wanna.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.319
Do as you're told!

16:29.800 --> 16:31.552
They were going to expel him.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.795
Which means education inspectors,

16:33.840 --> 16:36.718
which means home visits,
which means social services,

16:36.760 --> 16:39.957
because, in case you hadn't noticed,
no-one's bringing us up!

16:40.000 --> 16:44.835
ls that what you want, busybodies
crawling all over the house?

16:44.880 --> 16:47.030
Authorities deciding what's best for us?

16:47.080 --> 16:51.437
Cos that's what's gonna happen.
We'll all be broken up,

16:51.480 --> 16:56.600
thrown into care, or fostered
out to the nearest friggin' taker.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.632
- Why didn't you tell us?
- What would you have done, Lip?

16:59.680 --> 17:02.433
- Stopped shagging for five minutes?
- Expelled? What for?

17:02.480 --> 17:05.438
They think we're atheists.
He keeps denouncing God.

17:05.480 --> 17:09.189
Well, where did he get that from?
Who told him God don't exist?

17:09.240 --> 17:11.151
Don't blame me. l say prayers.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.348
lt was me.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.469
Why?

17:13.520 --> 17:16.079
- Cos it's true.
- Debs, he's a little kid!

17:16.119 --> 17:19.156
Exactly, so we shouldn't be telling
him lies about superior beings!

17:19.200 --> 17:24.991
You've done some screwy things in the past,
Debs, but this takes the fucking medal.

17:30.040 --> 17:33.555
So what did you tell 'em?
How did they buy it?

17:34.880 --> 17:36.996
lt's a collection of different cancers.

17:37.040 --> 17:40.191
They treat it with monthly
chemo sessions.

17:40.240 --> 17:43.755
l've got a letter from the hospital
detailing his treatment schedules.

17:43.800 --> 17:47.270
But you haven't got a letter
because he's not a fucking patient.

17:47.320 --> 17:50.232
Don't worry.

17:50.280 --> 17:54.478
- She didn't wanna see it. People never do.
- Maybe he just gets better.

17:54.520 --> 17:58.957
- Overnight?
- No, he's right. lt's our only way out of it.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.151
We let his hair grow back and pretend
the treatment's worked.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.997
But it can't leave this room.

18:04.040 --> 18:09.273
The less people know, the more chance
we've got of burying this.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.309
Yeah, one sec.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.157
ALL SHOUT AT ONCE

18:17.200 --> 18:20.192
Hang on, hang on,
l've only got one pair of hands!

18:21.760 --> 18:24.672
- Pint, please.
- l ordered two lagers...

18:24.720 --> 18:28.110
lt's not rocket science! How long
have you been coming in here for?

18:28.160 --> 18:30.515
What do you want, love? A lager? No problem.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.676
- ls it two pints?
- l asked for crisps.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.597
Night school, my arse...

18:34.640 --> 18:39.475
- Jez, can l borrow these, please?
- Yes, yeah, go on, take 'em.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.714
Thanks.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.353
Come on, Lillian, we're
three deep at the bar here.

18:44.400 --> 18:48.791
For example, in the sentence, ''l am
going to the bar to buy two beers,''

18:48.840 --> 18:52.310
we have two examples of how
the same sounding word

18:52.360 --> 18:55.033
is used in different contexts,

18:55.080 --> 18:58.675
but if l were to add,
''Would you like a beer too?''...

19:01.200 --> 19:06.069
..we can see how the
third meaning comes into play.

19:06.120 --> 19:09.795
Open your textbooks at page three,
and there are some

19:09.840 --> 19:11.353
straightforward examples of this rule.

19:11.400 --> 19:15.678
Have a look yourselves and then we'll...
we'll go through it together.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.636
Just gonna nip to the toilet, miss.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.111
Dirty bitch.

19:41.160 --> 19:45.790
Wants me in detention.
Corporal punishment.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.751
l've been a naughty boy...

19:47.800 --> 19:49.313
Are you gonna be long? >

19:49.360 --> 19:52.557
Erm, l'm fixing the cistern!

19:52.600 --> 19:53.828
Use the other one.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.030
Which other?

19:56.080 --> 19:59.629
Fuck should l know?
Nip out the fire door!

19:59.680 --> 20:02.319
l've nothing to bloody wipe with.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.311
Cheers, mate.

20:19.400 --> 20:22.073
Do people think l'm poorly?

20:22.120 --> 20:23.872
No.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.751
Well, sort of.

20:27.600 --> 20:31.229
Liam, listen to me carefully, right.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.236
lt's just a game we have to play,

20:33.280 --> 20:37.671
so if you do exactly what l tell you to do
then we won't get into trouble.

20:37.720 --> 20:39.950
So if people think you're poorly, that's OK.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.514
You have to let them think that, right?

20:42.560 --> 20:45.518
lt's all part of the game.
Do you understand?

20:45.560 --> 20:48.597
Off you go.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.678
We've got a problem!

20:57.720 --> 21:04.319
You got any spare change there for
the Little Liam fund? Oh, cheers.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.112
Thanks ever so much. Ta.

21:08.080 --> 21:10.310
Got any spare change in your pockets, gents?

21:11.440 --> 21:12.873
Dig deep in these pockets.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.115
There you go.

21:15.160 --> 21:18.755
Ah, that's brilliant, thanks ever so
much, ta. Brilliant, ta.

21:18.800 --> 21:22.076
A pound! ls that it? Little kiddie
at death's door and you

21:22.120 --> 21:25.908
can only manage a pound! We're sending
him to Disneyland, not Camelot!

21:25.960 --> 21:29.748
Sorry to hear about your Liam.
lt's a crying shame.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.758
l thought it were t'other one first - that idiot from
Oasis.

21:32.800 --> 21:38.033
l said to Maureen, ''He can pay for
his own trip, money he's making.'' Sorry.

21:40.920 --> 21:43.388
lf they've started collecting wedge
we're in deep shit.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.112
How did Jez find out?

21:45.160 --> 21:47.913
Father Crichton. He's touring pubs
with his collection tin.

21:47.960 --> 21:51.396
- Happy now?
- l didn't know they'd send him to Disneyworld!

21:51.440 --> 21:55.877
l'll go with him. They've got massive rides,
like Space Mountain, not just Mickey Mouse.

21:55.920 --> 21:59.117
- This is out of control.
- There's only one thing for it.

21:59.160 --> 22:02.038
We're gonna have to go down there
and tell 'em the truth.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.275
Stop it before it goes any further.

22:06.040 --> 22:08.679
- l'm not doing it.
- We'll all do it.

22:10.680 --> 22:13.752
Thanks ever so much. Very generous.

22:14.480 --> 22:16.072
God bless ya.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.553
Oh, thank you.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.433
Chemotherapy is a modern miracle.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.959
Absolutely.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.436
May l buy you a drink, Frank?

22:28.480 --> 22:30.471
Absolutely.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.514
- What the fuck's going on?
- Now, Dad, listen...

22:38.560 --> 22:40.755
Me own kiddie. And no-one tells me.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.109
l'm the last to know, as usual.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.879
l have to find out in the pub, off strangers.

22:45.920 --> 22:49.151
ls this how it is now?
ls this how we've ended up?

22:49.200 --> 22:53.318
Me own kids keeping secrets from me.

22:53.360 --> 22:57.319
Well, suppose l've only meself
to fucking blame, haven't l?

22:57.360 --> 22:59.555
But you could have fucking...

23:04.560 --> 23:07.028
My little Liam!

23:09.640 --> 23:12.108
Why...? Lickle Liam...

23:16.680 --> 23:19.911
He's me own flesh and blood.

23:19.960 --> 23:22.793
No, Dad, look it's...

23:22.840 --> 23:25.479
Community is about sticking together
and that's what we're gonna do

23:25.520 --> 23:30.514
so it's my pleasure to declare
the Liam Gallagher Appeal officially open.

23:30.560 --> 23:34.030
APPLAUSE

23:36.400 --> 23:39.870
- Frank. l came as soon as l heard.
- Oh, Mum, listen...

23:39.920 --> 23:43.469
Not now. lf we tell them, everyone'll know.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.158
Liam dying!

23:45.200 --> 23:48.431
lt's a wonder you can remember
what he looks like.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.311
Who rattled your fucking cage?

23:50.360 --> 23:55.309
When did you last spend the day
with him? Take him out. Have fun.

23:55.360 --> 23:56.759
Call yourself a father.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.631
Hang on a minute... Fuckin'...

23:58.680 --> 24:02.639
She's right, Frank. He needs his father.
They all need their father.

24:02.680 --> 24:07.310
We should be there for them,
like proper parents.

24:07.360 --> 24:10.989
Well, well, yeah, yeah, course. l mean...

24:11.040 --> 24:12.678
We could move in!

24:12.720 --> 24:15.917
Then we'd all be together.
Me, you and the kids.

24:15.960 --> 24:19.236
One big happy family under the same roof.

24:19.280 --> 24:21.840
(We need to talk.)

24:24.400 --> 24:26.072
Oh, my God.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.838
He's like summat from Chernobyl.

24:27.880 --> 24:30.633
(Kev) Debbie needs to see a shrink.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.716
How cracked have you got to be
to make summat like that up?

24:32.760 --> 24:36.389
She's a young girl trying to bring up a kiddie
that doesn't belong to her.

24:36.440 --> 24:39.637
- We should be praising her.
- For making up cancer, Veronica?

24:39.680 --> 24:42.274
For coping, with no parents

24:42.320 --> 24:45.835
and a bunch of brothers who expect her
to behave like their mother.

24:45.880 --> 24:48.314
They're gonna kill us, you know that.

24:48.360 --> 24:52.273
Hundreds of pounds have gone in.
Wages, benefits. For what?

24:52.320 --> 24:53.753
lt's a fucking sham.

24:53.800 --> 24:57.190
lf we tell people the truth,
what's the worst that can happen?

24:58.600 --> 25:00.238
Remember Teresa Tyler.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.715
Read all about it!

25:03.760 --> 25:06.399
Fake charity woman torched from home.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.476
Heartless bitch in fear of her life!

25:08.520 --> 25:10.476
Read all about it!

25:10.520 --> 25:15.310
lf they think you've used a kid to extort money,
they will build a fucking bonfire.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.271
We could just say it was a mistake.

25:17.320 --> 25:21.438
Like we thought he had cancer,
but we found out it was really mumps.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.277
Least l'm trying.

25:23.320 --> 25:26.949
We've gotta keep schtum, even if it means
not telling me dad and Sheila.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.198
- You can't let 'em think he's dying.
- He can't be trusted!

25:31.240 --> 25:34.789
lt's only for a few days. When it blows over
we'll tell them the truth.

25:34.840 --> 25:39.834
lt won't do Frank any harm to love
his son a bit harder, will it?

25:39.880 --> 25:41.711
You finished talking about me now?

25:48.520 --> 25:51.398
We can't just move in there, Sheila.

25:51.440 --> 25:53.715
He needs a mother, Frank.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.228
Yeah, but they've done all right so far.

25:56.280 --> 26:00.398
- Frank, he's your son! Come on.
- l know that, but...

26:00.440 --> 26:05.594
lt's like Marti Caine said,
''You should go into battle

26:05.640 --> 26:08.757
- ''like it's your worst enemy.''
- Look what happened to her.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.432
LAUGHlNG

26:13.480 --> 26:15.311
Laugh all you like.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.191
l borrowed these off your mam!

26:23.960 --> 26:25.837
- Where's everyone gonna sleep?

26:25.880 --> 26:28.474
- See?
- Aren't these two gonna want their own room?

26:28.520 --> 26:30.590
We'll have to convert the living room
into a granny flat,

26:30.640 --> 26:34.474
then no-one will be able to get next door.
We won't have any privacy.

26:34.520 --> 26:39.548
Not that we've got anything to hide or anything,
but we are adults, with very adult needs.

26:39.600 --> 26:43.912
No, no. No, Sheila, it's not gonna work.

26:43.960 --> 26:47.191
l don't know, the logistics are all to cock.

26:47.240 --> 26:52.360
l'm gonna have to sit down
and rethink... What the fuck...?

26:52.400 --> 26:54.231
What's this?

26:54.280 --> 26:56.714
ls this normal?
Who thinks this is normal?

26:56.760 --> 26:59.638
- lt's for Sue's depression.
- Lifting or deepening?

26:59.680 --> 27:01.796
- What's going on?
- They're moving in.

27:01.840 --> 27:04.434
- Says who?
- Someone could have told us.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.152
You don't even fucking live here.

27:06.200 --> 27:09.397
Never mind, there's more than
enough room for everyone.

27:09.440 --> 27:12.477
Come on, Sue,
you can help me with the cleaning.

27:12.520 --> 27:15.671
- l can't clean. The dust gives me migraines.
- Come on.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.478
SQUAWKlNG

27:30.520 --> 27:33.637
Present for Sue.
Pets are good for depression.

27:39.880 --> 27:42.314
OK, everyone, see you next week.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.430
So, how did you get on?

27:51.760 --> 27:53.512
Five out of five. Excellent.

27:53.560 --> 27:58.793
You're like, erm, teacher's pet.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.632
l've gotta go, miss.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.159
Ta-ra.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.719
ENGlNE SPLUTTERlNG

28:29.080 --> 28:31.071
What the fuck?

28:42.160 --> 28:45.072
Billy! This fucking car you sold me!

28:45.120 --> 28:47.031
You told me it wasn't a ringer!

28:47.080 --> 28:49.799
Bought as seen.
And that was five years ago.

28:49.840 --> 28:53.196
Now, fuck off. Our Satan's got a badger.

29:06.360 --> 29:08.078
l guess you'll be needing a lift.

29:22.400 --> 29:25.198
Well, this is as close as l go.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.629
After this, it's straight to my place.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.236
So...

29:33.240 --> 29:35.037
..what's it to be, Kev?

29:37.080 --> 29:40.550
Look, the thing is, Serena,
l've got a girl at home

29:40.600 --> 29:43.990
and, much as l would like to...

29:44.040 --> 29:46.270
she'd tear me dick off.

29:56.320 --> 29:57.673
She'd never know.

29:58.760 --> 30:03.038
ln my experience, women always know.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.798
Suit yourself.

30:06.120 --> 30:08.076
But l know you're interested,

30:08.120 --> 30:15.071
or you wouldn't have to keep nipping off
for a wank halfway through my lessons.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.588
l'm gonna have you, Kev,

30:17.640 --> 30:21.918
so if l were you, l would just...get...

30:21.960 --> 30:24.155
used to the idea.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.999
Thanks for the lift.

30:54.200 --> 30:57.954
Hey. There's kiddies dying
and you're doing that!

30:58.000 --> 30:59.797
Go on, ya dirty bastard!

30:59.840 --> 31:01.353
Go on!

31:19.040 --> 31:20.678
Sheila, love, slow down.

31:20.720 --> 31:24.110
l've got a house full of people
with hungry stomachs.

31:24.160 --> 31:28.995
- When will we get a chance to eat all this?
- We need to conserve our energy.

31:29.040 --> 31:32.999
l've done breakfast, dinner and tea -
whatever's left can be frozen.

31:33.040 --> 31:34.951
They can all look after themselves -

31:35.000 --> 31:38.117
what do you think they did before we moved in,
starved?

31:38.160 --> 31:41.152
l mean, look at 'em,
none of 'em are wasting awa...

31:49.160 --> 31:53.039
Just stop fuckin' cookin', will yer?
You're like a woman possessed.

31:53.080 --> 31:56.709
We need food, Frank.
lt's what keeps us healthy.

31:56.760 --> 32:00.389
Besides, little Liam's
enjoying himself, aren't you?

32:00.440 --> 32:03.557
Mummy's little helper.
Oh, my risotto'll be turned to mud.

32:10.120 --> 32:14.511
lf you're looking for drugs,
they hide 'em in the cistern.

32:14.560 --> 32:18.678
No, no, l was just... Just a bit of dope
or summat, just take the edge off.

32:18.720 --> 32:24.477
l mean, what with your brother
and it's being back here... lt's all a bit of a...

32:25.440 --> 32:27.158
Dad.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.236
About Liam...

32:29.280 --> 32:30.679
The thing is...

32:30.720 --> 32:32.676
What the fuck you both doing in here?

32:32.720 --> 32:34.233
Looking for your drugs.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.350
Well, good luck, cos l ain't got any.

32:36.400 --> 32:41.474
No gear?! You call yourself a fuckin'
teenager! Hey... where's lan's stash?

32:53.520 --> 32:56.353
You've gotta stop Jez,
she's talking to a journalist.

32:56.400 --> 32:57.515
You're joking.

32:57.560 --> 33:00.950
- She's arranging a charity day.
- Jesus!

33:01.000 --> 33:02.672
We'll have to tell her the truth.

33:02.720 --> 33:06.474
Jez! Are you out of your mind?
She'll sack the pair of us.

33:06.520 --> 33:10.195
We can't let it go in the papers -
if she starts checking details,

33:10.240 --> 33:12.390
we'll be hung out to dry.

33:12.440 --> 33:15.113
l didn't go telling everyone
he had fucking cancer.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.674
- Neither did l.
- You didn't stop it when you found out.

33:17.720 --> 33:21.269
- l was trying to protect Debbie.
- Yeah, and look where that's got us!

33:21.320 --> 33:24.278
- Hey, what's going on?
- We've got a problem.

33:24.320 --> 33:27.676
Events, celebrities, fairground...

33:27.720 --> 33:32.350
the entire day with one aim -
helping a sick child in his hour of need.

33:32.400 --> 33:35.597
And l assume you'll be contributing
the profits from the bar.

33:35.640 --> 33:39.474
Don't push it, sweetheart.
l've a living to earn, you know.

33:39.520 --> 33:44.071
OK, think l've got everything.
Right, l wanna get a snapper down,

33:44.120 --> 33:45.997
get a shot of Liam and his family.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.314
Front page spread?

33:47.360 --> 33:50.397
That depends if there's a murder.
Sick kids are good,

33:50.440 --> 33:53.273
but there's only one,
and nothing beats a murder.

33:53.320 --> 33:56.312
Let me know when you've
confirmed a celebrity.

33:56.360 --> 33:58.396
This day for little Liam, what you calling it?

33:58.440 --> 34:00.158
Liam Day!

34:02.360 --> 34:03.839
Bitch.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.711
We're finished.

34:05.760 --> 34:08.353
Maybe not. Cover for me.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.949
- Where's Kash?
- Er, in the back. Kash!

34:15.080 --> 34:17.150
Cancer wrist bands?

34:17.199 --> 34:19.395
Yep, l'm happy to do my bit.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.748
They're not even charity registered.

34:21.800 --> 34:24.109
They're still promoting the cause.

34:25.199 --> 34:27.998
Live 8, Comic Relief -

34:28.040 --> 34:31.190
do you think they all do it out of
the goodness of their hearts? Bollocks.

34:31.239 --> 34:36.030
Every time Bono shits, he earns a million quid.
He ain't making my poverty history!

34:36.080 --> 34:40.551
We're in a mess. You're the only one
that can get us out of it.

34:40.600 --> 34:45.310
See, the trouble with you is
you put it all down to faith.

34:45.360 --> 34:48.193
Faith. Faith!

34:48.239 --> 34:53.030
Well, people haven't got fucking faith.
lt's all drip, drip, drip...

34:53.080 --> 34:55.469
Drought, famine, tsunami...

34:55.520 --> 34:59.559
Drip, drip, drip. Things are
getting worse out here, you know?

34:59.600 --> 35:02.956
Just gettin' fuckin' worse,
so they think, ''Fuck him,

35:03.000 --> 35:05.560
''let him sit on his cloud,
twiddling his beard.''

35:05.600 --> 35:09.036
As flies to wanton boys
are we to the gods.

35:09.080 --> 35:12.038
They kill us for their sport.

35:12.080 --> 35:15.629
Fuckin' Shakespeare, fuckin' King Lear.

35:15.680 --> 35:19.036
Yeah, fucking, he had it right, didn't he?
But you can't expect us

35:19.080 --> 35:22.038
to like you just like that,
as a matter of course.

35:22.080 --> 35:24.913
You can't expect
''O, come let us adore him...''

35:24.960 --> 35:27.554
Fuck off! Where's your cure for cancer?

35:27.600 --> 35:32.310
Where's your cure for cancer?
Where's your cure for cancer, eh?

35:32.360 --> 35:35.238
Where's your help for the lickle
Ethiopians and lickle kiddies

35:35.280 --> 35:38.670
with two hearts and arms
that don't fucking work properly?

35:38.720 --> 35:42.713
lf you want us to have fucking faith,
you're gonna have to prove yourself.

35:42.760 --> 35:48.312
Second Coming, parting of the waves,
something spectacular,

35:48.360 --> 35:51.079
something biblical, you know?

35:51.120 --> 35:53.714
Otherwise, the fucking game's up...
Whoa, whoa...

35:53.760 --> 35:57.070
Kiss the brick, Franky boy.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.116
Argh, this is intimidation.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.594
You know, it's harassment.

36:02.640 --> 36:06.110
l know how the fucking Muslims feel now.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.639
lnnocent man, eh, Frank?

36:11.880 --> 36:17.432
On the good ship Lollipop
lt's a nice way...

36:17.480 --> 36:21.598
Got a party tonight. Big bash.
No hard feelings, eh, Frank?

36:22.960 --> 36:25.076
Me son is dying!

36:26.680 --> 36:30.878
lf there's one time you're allowed
to get mashed off your fucking face...

36:38.400 --> 36:40.311
Little Liam.

36:47.800 --> 36:50.394
(All) Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners

36:50.440 --> 36:53.034
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.640
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee,

36:55.680 --> 36:57.318
blessed art thou amongst women

36:57.360 --> 36:59.828
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

36:59.880 --> 37:02.792
(All) Holy Mary mother of God,
pray for us sinners

37:02.840 --> 37:05.752
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

37:05.800 --> 37:08.030
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee,

37:08.080 --> 37:10.594
blessed art thou amongst women and...

37:14.560 --> 37:16.835
- Kev!
- What you doing creeping round?

37:16.880 --> 37:20.555
- What you doing cracking one off?
- Just fancied it.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.956
- Why didn't you wait?
- l didn't know when you were gonna be back.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.513
Right, what's going on?

37:30.560 --> 37:32.039
What you talking about?

37:32.080 --> 37:34.548
You. You're acting weird.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.397
l... l'm not.

37:37.520 --> 37:41.035
l think it's all this Liam stuff,
you know, it's making me edgy.

37:41.080 --> 37:45.437
Liam not dying makes you
want to wank off to teenie porn.

37:47.640 --> 37:51.872
lt's this, innit, V? l can't do it.
lt's just not happening.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.672
You've only been twice.

37:53.720 --> 37:56.712
Yeah, l know but it's gonna take
months and years.

37:56.760 --> 38:00.992
And for what? To be able to do
what everyone else finds piss easy.

38:01.040 --> 38:05.989
Yeah. And so you can feel good about
yourself, go for the jobs you want, yeah,

38:06.040 --> 38:09.635
read the paper instead of looking at
the fuckin' pictures.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.194
You are not jibbing it,
not without good reason.

38:12.240 --> 38:14.390
l've got a good reason.

38:20.480 --> 38:24.234
lt's full of spods, the class, you know?

38:24.280 --> 38:26.236
And knobheads who can't fucking read.

38:26.280 --> 38:29.795
l feel like one of the school spanners, again.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.718
You're doing really well.
You've just gotta keep at it.

38:32.760 --> 38:34.273
'Ey...

38:34.320 --> 38:39.110
do you think l like wiggling me wares for
a load of overweight businessmen? No!

38:39.160 --> 38:42.197
But l've gotta do it, because l want
a summer holiday. Same with you.

38:42.240 --> 38:46.518
So no more moaning,
and no more wanking - you're going.

39:21.200 --> 39:26.513
As a representative of the local council, l'm
delighted to announce that, in conjunction

39:26.560 --> 39:31.076
with Saint Gabriel's RC Primary School
and the local church, we've decided

39:31.120 --> 39:35.193
to use Liam Day as a fundraiser
not only for little Liam Gallagher,

39:35.240 --> 39:38.869
bless him, but also a number of
other sick children in the locale.

39:43.280 --> 39:46.272
Miss Murdoch, Father Crichton
and myself have agreed

39:46.320 --> 39:49.995
that a pilgrimage to Lourdes,
the renowned sacred home of healing,

39:50.040 --> 39:55.239
would be the appropriate venue for the trip,
as well as a brief stop at Euro Disney.

39:55.280 --> 39:59.990
The local council will be providing a minibus,
free of charge, for the entirety of the jaunt.

40:00.040 --> 40:04.556
APPLAUSE

40:04.600 --> 40:08.115
l know exactly what you're going through.

40:08.160 --> 40:10.879
We lost our Toby to it last September.

40:18.600 --> 40:22.388
Thanks, love. lt's the kindness of
strangers that gets you through.

40:26.520 --> 40:27.999
Dicko!

40:32.640 --> 40:36.758
Got some wicked new stuff coming in.
Stronger. Proper spaceman stuff.

40:36.800 --> 40:39.792
Stronger the better.
l want a direct route to oblivion.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.391
- l don't get it.
- What's not to get?

40:49.440 --> 40:51.908
Council donates a minibus,
which immediately gives

40:51.960 --> 40:53.678
the whole thing a ring of authenticity.

40:53.720 --> 40:58.919
We fill it full of young unfortunates, send it to
France and voila, the appeal's done its job.

40:58.960 --> 41:01.997
Not all about Liam,
he's just one of a bunch kids,

41:02.040 --> 41:04.031
which stops that reporter sticking
her nose where it's not wanted.

41:04.080 --> 41:06.469
What do you get out of it?

41:06.520 --> 41:09.034
Good publicity for the council.
Plus a bit extra...

41:09.080 --> 41:10.195
Viagra.

41:10.240 --> 41:12.959
l've a mate in Toulouse
who imports it from lndia.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.117
Thousand boxes at a tenner a pop.
Pick it up en route.

41:16.160 --> 41:17.388
Amount of limp dicks round here,
we're gonna clean up.

41:17.440 --> 41:20.398
We need a driver. You in or what?

41:22.000 --> 41:25.959
Why not? Could do with some spare dosh.
l need a new fucking car.

41:41.880 --> 41:44.314
Well, what about one of the Spice Girls?

41:44.360 --> 41:46.715
l don't care... any.
Oh, but not Geri, not if

41:46.760 --> 41:48.751
she's gonna bring that bleedin' dog.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.438
Take That then.

41:50.480 --> 41:53.233
l know we'll not get Robbie but
the rest of them can't be busy.

41:53.280 --> 41:55.032
l can phone her if you like.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.594
Oh, we're not having Su Pollard!

42:00.400 --> 42:02.197
DOORBELL RlNGS

42:04.480 --> 42:06.994
(Lip) Feeling any better, Sue?

42:07.040 --> 42:08.996
Little bit.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.871
You can't rush these things.

42:10.920 --> 42:13.639
Depression lifts in its own good time.

42:13.680 --> 42:17.229
Bit lower, Marty, that's it.

42:20.840 --> 42:23.149
Me mam's here.

42:31.560 --> 42:33.869
- Liam.
- Who is it?

42:38.480 --> 42:40.471
l'm your mummy.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.511
l'm your mummy.

42:45.480 --> 42:46.959
l'm your mummy.

42:49.040 --> 42:51.349
l'm your mummy.

42:53.280 --> 42:55.157
SHE SOBS

42:55.200 --> 42:57.668
All right, Monica.

43:01.520 --> 43:04.318
(Sobbing) Why didn't you tell me?

43:04.360 --> 43:06.828
Why didn't anybody tell me?

43:06.880 --> 43:09.952
SOBBlNG UNCONTROLLABLY

43:15.520 --> 43:17.476
He's not ill.

43:19.280 --> 43:20.872
lt's all a lie.

43:27.880 --> 43:29.518
lt was a mistake.

43:29.560 --> 43:32.950
She didn't mean any harm.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.117
lf you'd come for the home visit,
none of this would have happened.

43:36.160 --> 43:39.516
Oh, so it's my fault, is it?

43:39.560 --> 43:41.994
Fuckin' hell!
And there's me thinking it was you.

43:42.040 --> 43:45.476
Or you, or you, or you, or you.

43:45.520 --> 43:48.910
No, it's fucking Frank. Again.

43:48.960 --> 43:52.111
l suppose Tweedledum and
Tweedle-fuckin'-dee knew an' all, did they?

43:52.160 --> 43:54.230
- We knew.
- Yeah, yeah, just muggins here.

43:54.280 --> 43:55.998
l didn't know either, Frank.

43:56.040 --> 43:57.155
Oh, fine.

43:59.880 --> 44:01.757
lf that's how much l fucking matter,

44:01.800 --> 44:04.678
you'll be better off without me.

44:04.720 --> 44:06.278
Frank! Frank... !

44:06.320 --> 44:08.595
This is sick.

44:08.640 --> 44:11.279
(Monica) This is beyond sick.

44:12.720 --> 44:15.359
Evil fucking bitch!

44:41.120 --> 44:44.351
Why did nobody tell me Fiona had left?

44:44.400 --> 44:46.630
You've got me number, you could have called.

44:46.680 --> 44:49.319
That's a two-way street.
Try ringing us from time to time.

44:49.360 --> 44:52.193
We were managing OK until all this happened.

44:52.240 --> 44:53.355
There's a fundraising day Saturday.

44:53.400 --> 44:54.958
You can't go through with it.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.991
We've got no option.

44:57.040 --> 45:00.589
Will you stay for it?
lt'd look better if you were there.

45:00.640 --> 45:03.632
lt'd be like l was going along with a lie.

45:03.680 --> 45:05.193
He's my baby.

45:05.240 --> 45:09.677
When l heard that word ''cancer'',
it tore me apart.

45:12.280 --> 45:15.238
Don't worry, l'm not staying.

45:15.280 --> 45:18.352
Just gonna go and say goodbye to Liam.

45:31.160 --> 45:32.513
Thought tonight was night school.

45:32.560 --> 45:34.437
No, it's off, teacher's been run over.

45:34.480 --> 45:36.311
You've not packed it in already.

45:36.360 --> 45:40.433
No, no. Fucking teacher's ill.
lntensive care, life support.

45:40.480 --> 45:44.678
They've had to call the priest in,
not even sure if she's...she's...

45:44.720 --> 45:46.153
l can't bleedin' go, can l?

45:46.200 --> 45:50.034
- Why not?
- Because the teacher's hitting on me.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.833
l'm frightened l'm gonna end up boning her.

45:52.880 --> 45:55.519
No, it's not funny, Karen. She means business.

45:55.560 --> 45:57.278
Proper porno poses, the works.

45:57.320 --> 45:58.833
And l take it Veronica don't know.

45:58.880 --> 46:03.829
No. And as far as she's concerned
l'm still gonna go to me lessons.

46:03.880 --> 46:08.032
- How long you gonna keep that up for?
- Dunno. As long as it takes, Karen.

46:08.760 --> 46:10.591
Oh, Jesus.

46:11.680 --> 46:14.558
What if she looks in me work book?

46:14.600 --> 46:16.875
Me school book.
There'll be no new sentences in it.

46:16.920 --> 46:18.035
Well, write some.

46:18.080 --> 46:21.277
Got a bit of a problem there, Karen.

46:21.320 --> 46:23.072
You couldn't help us, could you?

46:23.120 --> 46:25.509
Bring it here, then.

46:30.640 --> 46:32.596
Ta.

46:32.640 --> 46:33.868
Are you back?

46:44.120 --> 46:45.314
How was strip-o-gram?

46:45.360 --> 46:47.999
Some jug-eared tosspot's 40th.

46:48.040 --> 46:51.953
He got a lob on though, so l must have
been doing summat right.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.228
How was college?

46:53.280 --> 46:54.633
Oh, crap.

46:54.680 --> 46:57.797
Well, we did do that quick brown fox thing.

46:57.840 --> 46:58.989
What's that?

46:59.040 --> 47:04.353
You know.
The ''Quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog''.

47:04.400 --> 47:08.518
Look, it's a sentence, right,
using every letter in the alphabet.

47:08.560 --> 47:11.313
Good, innit?
l were well impressed.

47:11.360 --> 47:13.032
Learn something new everyday.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.149
You're not kidding.

47:14.200 --> 47:15.349
What?

47:15.400 --> 47:17.960
You've not been, have you?

47:18.000 --> 47:19.228
Yeah, course l have. Look.

47:19.280 --> 47:23.478
''Dear Veronica, l can't go to night school
cos the teacher is a horny little bitch

47:23.520 --> 47:26.159
''who keeps flashing me her fanny.
Sorry, love, Kev.''

47:26.200 --> 47:28.031
Kev!

47:28.080 --> 47:32.358
l was gonna tell you but l thought
you'd rip her eyes out.

47:32.400 --> 47:36.393
Veronica, she's a fucking predator, right.
lt's sexual harassment.

47:36.440 --> 47:39.477
lf l was a bird,
l could have her up in court.

47:39.520 --> 47:42.637
Men, you are pathetic. Can you not
trust yourself not to shag someone?

47:42.680 --> 47:45.638
She wouldn't leave me alone, right.

47:45.680 --> 47:48.274
She said she was gonna have me,
no matter what.

47:48.320 --> 47:51.517
l felt like l were being
unfaithful just looking at her.

47:51.560 --> 47:53.835
l only wanted to learn to read.

47:53.880 --> 47:56.872
lt's not my fault l'm irresistible.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.150
So much for bettering myself.

48:01.200 --> 48:03.794
Gonna be pulling pints for the rest of me life.

48:06.720 --> 48:10.190
- l can teach you to read.
- Wouldn't that drive you potty?

48:10.240 --> 48:12.549
Probably.

48:12.600 --> 48:17.549
But we're a couple, aren't we,
and sometimes that means doing things

48:17.600 --> 48:20.433
for the benefit of the other.

48:23.160 --> 48:27.756
lt's all the rage. Corporates,
bisexual birthdays. We'll clean up.

48:27.800 --> 48:32.351
l can't take me kit off in
a room full of strangers, V.

48:32.400 --> 48:34.197
You'll be fine.

48:34.240 --> 48:36.595
Packet like yours,
they'll be all over yer.

48:36.640 --> 48:40.349
l can't do it, V. One chipolata gag,
l'll be a gibbering wreck.

48:40.400 --> 48:43.358
Fine, Kev. Could have doubled
our income as a strip-o-gram

48:43.400 --> 48:46.039
and l could've taught you to read
into the bargain.

48:54.120 --> 48:55.951
Can't l be a cowboy?

48:56.000 --> 48:57.274
Frank.

48:57.320 --> 49:00.835
Say petrol. Petrol.

49:02.360 --> 49:04.874
(Marty) Say bonfire.

49:04.920 --> 49:07.434
l guess he didn't come back.

49:07.480 --> 49:11.871
l expect he must have slept at home.
At our old house.

49:12.600 --> 49:14.192
(Marty) Matches...

49:14.240 --> 49:15.434
(Debbie) l'm really sorry, Sheila.

49:15.480 --> 49:18.916
The last thing we wanted
was to hurt you or me dad.

49:18.960 --> 49:20.188
You just...

49:20.240 --> 49:23.038
..Couldn't be trusted.

49:23.080 --> 49:24.274
Bucket biff!

49:24.320 --> 49:25.958
(Parrot) Bucket biff.

49:26.040 --> 49:27.029
He did it.

49:27.080 --> 49:31.596
Help us get through this, Sheila,
please, we need you.

49:31.640 --> 49:32.914
Really?

49:34.400 --> 49:36.277
(Parrot) Bucket biff!

49:37.000 --> 49:38.991
BRASS BAND PLAYS

49:43.560 --> 49:46.996
Good afternoon, everybody,
and thank you all for coming.

49:47.040 --> 49:50.874
The time is 12.30,
the place is Chatsworth, England.

49:50.920 --> 49:53.559
Welcome to Liam Day!

49:55.360 --> 49:58.397
lf we get through this,
it'll be a fuckin' miracle.

49:58.440 --> 50:01.034
Just gotta keep our nerve.

50:01.240 --> 50:03.151
Few hours, it'll all be over.

50:20.280 --> 50:21.793
Oi! You lot, off!

50:21.840 --> 50:24.798
lf you wanna bounce,
go and shag your sister.

50:25.560 --> 50:27.437
(Boy) Fuck off, you mean cow.

50:27.480 --> 50:29.232
lt's only a quid down the offie.

50:29.280 --> 50:31.316
Piss off down the offie then, Billy.

50:31.360 --> 50:33.669
Ring Debbie, tell her we want
the star of the show here by two.

50:33.720 --> 50:34.835
And get your wristband on.

50:34.880 --> 50:41.069
Now l know how Geldof must have felt.
Give us your fucking money!

50:41.120 --> 50:44.271
Hey, you little shit.
You didn't even pay for that!

50:47.400 --> 50:49.630
What the fuck you doing? He's wasted.

50:49.680 --> 50:50.669
lan.

50:52.680 --> 50:54.477
BURPS

50:57.080 --> 50:58.832
Look, we made a mistake.

50:58.880 --> 51:00.074
Not interested.

51:00.120 --> 51:02.554
No, it were wrong.
We shouldn't have kept it from yer.

51:02.600 --> 51:05.068
Not interested.

51:05.120 --> 51:07.953
But we were in the shit,
we had to make decisions.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.436
Not fuckin' interested.

51:11.480 --> 51:15.632
Well, maybe you should try asking
yourself why we didn't tell yer.

51:20.040 --> 51:23.237
Ah, Dicko, the very man.

51:25.280 --> 51:27.794
Come on, l need that spaceman stuff.

51:43.200 --> 51:45.316
FANFARE

51:53.520 --> 51:55.829
(Woman) ls that him?

51:57.920 --> 52:00.150
ls that the cancer boy?

52:03.600 --> 52:05.591
Why is everybody clapping?

52:05.640 --> 52:07.119
Just pretend you're Superman, yeah?

52:08.760 --> 52:12.309
Hello and thank you all for coming.
Hope you're enjoying Liam Day.

52:15.560 --> 52:18.950
Today is a very special day,
because it's about our community,

52:19.000 --> 52:22.913
the community of Chatsworth,
coming together in a common cause.

52:22.960 --> 52:26.191
Little Liam Gallagher
is an exceptional child

52:26.240 --> 52:29.994
and l'd like us all to commend and
applaud this young man's bravery.

52:35.120 --> 52:36.599
l'm delighted to announce that,

52:36.640 --> 52:41.236
thanks to your generosity, we've
reached our appeal target of £6,000.

52:41.280 --> 52:44.158
Whatever's going on?

52:44.200 --> 52:45.792
Little Liam, dying of cancer.

52:45.840 --> 52:49.435
lt's a bummer, like, but at least
he gets a free holiday out of it.

52:49.480 --> 52:52.836
Nooooooooooo!

52:52.880 --> 52:54.916
Why do you keep punishing me?

52:54.960 --> 52:56.996
Haven't l done enough?

52:57.040 --> 52:58.473
(Veronica) Mum. Mum!

52:58.520 --> 53:00.351
Carol!

53:00.400 --> 53:05.190
Don't let it happen.
Don't let this little boy be taken away.

53:05.240 --> 53:07.913
(OVER PA) lt's all right, Debbie
made it up, it's only a game.

53:07.960 --> 53:10.110
Liam, no!

53:10.160 --> 53:13.152
(CROWD) What?!

53:14.560 --> 53:17.028
Debbie? ls this true, Debbie?

53:18.360 --> 53:20.749
lt's a load of bollocks.
He's not even dying!

53:20.800 --> 53:23.360
(Woman) lt's a con.

53:23.400 --> 53:26.437
They're nicking our fuckin' money!

53:27.880 --> 53:31.919
This is still a worthy cause.
These children deserve your support...

53:36.240 --> 53:38.629
ARGH!

53:43.600 --> 53:45.318
Help!

53:45.880 --> 53:48.952
(Lip) What's happened? What's he done?

53:49.000 --> 53:50.638
Dad!

53:50.680 --> 53:53.877
(Lip) He's not breathing.
Veronica, he's not breathing.

53:53.920 --> 53:56.309
(lan) ls he just pissed?
Do something, he can't be dead.

53:56.360 --> 53:58.794
(Carl) Why in't anyone doing anything?

53:58.840 --> 54:00.990
Someone call an ambulance.

54:01.040 --> 54:03.235
Please, someone help. Dad!

54:03.280 --> 54:06.113
Daughter's deceit leaves Dad dead.

54:08.960 --> 54:11.394
SlREN WAlLS

54:19.040 --> 54:21.838
Don't you dare die,

54:21.880 --> 54:23.472
because who will that help?

54:23.520 --> 54:26.592
Then we'll have no-one.
ls that what you want,

54:26.640 --> 54:29.074
to leave us on our own?

54:29.120 --> 54:31.509
Mum's gone, Fiona's gone.

54:31.560 --> 54:38.398
And now you're gonna leave us.
lt's not fair. lt's just not fair.

54:38.440 --> 54:40.715
So you're gonna have to live,

54:40.760 --> 54:44.070
and that's the end of it.
Do you hear me?

54:45.200 --> 54:48.272
l know l shouldn't have
told everyone Liam had cancer...

54:49.720 --> 54:53.998
..and l know you hate me
for not telling you the truth.

54:54.040 --> 54:56.349
But you're my dad

54:56.400 --> 54:58.675
and l'll make everything all right, l promise.

54:58.720 --> 55:01.553
lf you live,
l'll make everything all right.

55:16.760 --> 55:18.352
Excuse me, excuse me.

55:34.960 --> 55:37.269
Debbie. Here y'are.

55:39.360 --> 55:42.432
He will be all right, won't he, Debbie?

55:59.880 --> 56:01.871
Struck down at the moment of truth.

56:01.920 --> 56:04.673
lt's biblical, is this.
lt's God's way of telling her

56:04.720 --> 56:06.756
what she did was pure evil.

56:06.800 --> 56:08.791
Carol, zip it.

56:08.840 --> 56:10.592
Don't you think l know that?

56:10.640 --> 56:13.438
But l can't turn back the clock, can l?

56:13.480 --> 56:15.072
Get off.

56:18.720 --> 56:20.153
Let him live.

56:20.200 --> 56:22.873
Please, let him live.
l can't be on my own.

56:22.920 --> 56:24.512
l'd rather die than be without him.

56:24.560 --> 56:26.152
Please.

56:26.200 --> 56:29.670
Frank's had a toxic reaction,
which lead to his collapse.

56:29.720 --> 56:31.312
He doesn't work with
animals at all, does he?

56:31.360 --> 56:33.351
- No.
- No.

56:33.400 --> 56:36.949
Only, he seems to have consumed
a large quantity of phencyclidine.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.788
lt's a tranquiliser,
often used by vets to calm horses.

56:40.840 --> 56:42.193
- He'll be all right, though?
- He'll be fine.

56:42.240 --> 56:45.630
Few days rest
but he's had a lucky escape.

56:45.680 --> 56:48.911
PCP's one of the big boys,
not to be fooled with.

56:48.960 --> 56:50.439
Oh.

57:11.240 --> 57:13.435
We're taking him home.

57:13.480 --> 57:14.959
His home's here.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.515
Liam, love, all your things are ready.

57:18.560 --> 57:21.597
You're gonna come back to
Mummy's house for a while.

57:21.640 --> 57:23.312
Mum, you can't just take him.

57:23.360 --> 57:25.112
He doesn't know me.

57:25.160 --> 57:27.390
l'm his mum and he
can't remember who l am.

57:27.440 --> 57:28.589
Whose fault's that?

57:28.640 --> 57:32.428
You know why l left.

57:32.480 --> 57:35.870
Look you're all grown-up now...
Well, nearly grown-up.

57:35.920 --> 57:38.639
Oh, Liam, he's so young.

57:38.680 --> 57:40.830
We need to spend some proper time together.

57:40.880 --> 57:43.474
(Monica) Come here, lovey.

57:43.520 --> 57:45.431
Mam, don't do this.

57:45.480 --> 57:48.313
lt's not fair. You can't split us up again.

57:48.360 --> 57:51.397
You can't do this. l won't let yer.

57:51.440 --> 57:52.509
This is nowt to do with you.

57:52.560 --> 57:54.152
lt's got everything to do with me.

57:54.200 --> 57:57.112
You wanna pick a fight,
you're messing with the wrong chicks.

57:57.160 --> 57:58.275
We're taking him.
and that's the end of it.

57:58.320 --> 57:59.309
Over my dead body.

57:59.360 --> 58:00.395
lf necessary.

58:00.440 --> 58:02.908
(Monica) There isn't a court in the land
wouldn't support me having my son.

58:02.960 --> 58:04.712
Well, we'll see then, won't we?

58:04.760 --> 58:06.876
That's the only way
he's gonna leave this house.

58:06.920 --> 58:07.955
Stop it.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.116
Just stop it!

58:10.160 --> 58:12.037
You're arguing over him
like he's a lost dog.

58:12.080 --> 58:15.595
He's got a mouth, and a brain. He can
decide what he wants for himself.

58:15.640 --> 58:17.278
He's a five-year-old boy.

58:17.320 --> 58:19.629
Why don't you try asking him?

58:27.240 --> 58:29.356
Liam, love,

58:29.400 --> 58:34.190
we need to decide where you're gonna live,
who's gonna look after you.

58:34.240 --> 58:36.959
Do you understand?

58:37.000 --> 58:40.549
(Monica) So, where do you think
you'd be happiest?

58:40.600 --> 58:43.319
With me, your real mummy...

58:43.360 --> 58:44.554
..and Norma.

58:44.600 --> 58:46.397
(Monica) And Norma.

58:46.440 --> 58:51.594
Or staying here, with, erm,
Sheila and...your father.

58:51.640 --> 58:54.313
lt's up to you, mate.

58:54.360 --> 58:56.112
Whatever you choose is all right.

59:17.360 --> 59:22.798
Some weekends, as long as
l can have him some weekends.

59:29.720 --> 59:34.874
lt's funny. ln spite of everything
that's happened, l feel good again.

59:34.920 --> 59:38.276
The clouds have lifted,
and it's all down to you.

59:38.320 --> 59:39.719
l just want you to be happy.

59:41.400 --> 59:43.118
l am.

59:43.160 --> 59:45.230
With you looking after me.

59:45.280 --> 59:46.793
(Parrot) Lazy bitch. Lazy bitch.

59:46.840 --> 59:49.513
But that parrot's gotta go.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:08.078
Let's get you inside. Hot bath
and rest, that's what you need.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.395
You've got to start
looking after yourself.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.715
l don't wanna be widowed
before l'm even wed.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.592
Heard every word.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.633
This is erm...interesting.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.432
Did you make it yourself, Sheila?

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.038
Yeah. lt's quite straightforward.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.150
lt's, erm, wine, brandy, cinnamon
sticks, cloves...

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.430
..Paintstripper!

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.469
Aren't you supposed to put
sugar in mulled wine, Sheila?

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.351
Sugar? l forgot the sugar.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.197
Must have been all the excitement.

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:43.676
Never mind, you can add your own
sugar when you want. Here you go.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:47.554
(Carol) Good health.
(ALL) Good health.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.751
Unaccustomed as l am...
Erm, l'd like to say a few words.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:01:00.039
Sometimes, you know, it takes a bolt
from the blue to make you realise...

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.632
..what is important in life.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.114
And, er... And, er...

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.037
Sorry. l'm welling up here.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.674
Because just before l hit the deck,

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:15.474
thinking that me number
was up, l had a vision.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.719
A sort of premonition.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.796
Clear as day.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.308
Like l could touch it.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:30.638
And it was me and Sheila, together,

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:34.150
grey-haired and wrinkly,

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:39.433
in Sheila's house on Sheila's couch,
surrounded by all our children.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.629
Every single one of yer.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:50.676
And you were looking after us
in our dotage.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:54.110
And no matter what we needed,

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.230
you couldn't do enough for us.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.555
Oh, Frank.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.556
No, no, all right, just wait a minute.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.318
Let me finish what l'm saying.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.635
What l'm saying is...

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.193
l forgive you.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:12.074
For the lies, the deceit.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.432
Because...

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.837
l know that, whenever l need you,

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:23.953
you will always be there for me.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.832
Me and you are going home, our home,

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.348
so we can make this vision come true.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.198
Yeah, Frank.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.948
(Sheila) Cheers.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.479
(ALL) Cheers.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.715
(Frank) 'They say truth's stranger than
fiction, and it's true.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.753
'l mean, the world's full of people
doing mad, sick, crazy things.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.473
'Take a look around you.
You couldn't make it up

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.590
'in a month of fucking Sundays.'

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.749
What's new pussycat?
Whoa, whoa, whoa

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.597
- Do you wanna drink?
- All right.

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.790
Unless you fancy
something a little bit stronger.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.634
Poke my sister, you're dead.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.875
You make me so fucking horny.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.353
ls that what Romeo said to Juliet?

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.312
Move your fucking hand, you silly bitch.
l just need a room.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.749
Damsel in distress needing shelter.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.030
He's begging her, she's slapping him.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.036
Who the fuck have we let into our lives?

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.873
He's not your fucking mate!

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:36.036
lt's just a normal family home.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:23.639
Q-U-l-C-K.

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:29.038
B-R-O... U?

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.710
Wrong. There's no U in brown.

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:37.435
Ah, does that mean l'm gonna
have to have the cane again, miss.

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:41.519
l'm afraid so. Bend over.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.516
(Kev) Ooh, miss.
