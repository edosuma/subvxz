Remember when he tried to run
away to the North Pole

20:26.856 --> 20:28.191
Should we do it?

20:28.274 --> 20:30.401
What allegiance do we have
to the Guild?

20:30.485 --> 20:31.945
They made us a Level 10,
then they handed me

20:32.028 --> 20:34.572
some horse shit about
Venture being related to me.

20:34.656 --> 20:36.616
Yeah, nah,
I'm tired of their crap.

20:36.699 --> 20:38.952
Yeah, but,
dude, that was your ex!

20:39.035 --> 20:40.662
Your wife
is gonna flip out.

20:40.745 --> 20:42.246
Relax.
It's nothing.

20:42.330 --> 20:44.707
I dated her right before
I met my wife.

20:44.791 --> 20:46.501
She dumped me!

20:46.584 --> 20:49.087
Yeah, she dumped me
because she was screwing
that ass-hat

20:49.170 --> 20:50.630
Venture
while we were together.

20:50.713 --> 20:52.131
Oh, my God!

20:52.215 --> 20:54.509
That's like origin
myth stuff!

20:54.592 --> 20:56.135
The truth
has been revealed.

20:56.219 --> 20:58.930
Dude, that's like reason 100
I hate Venture.

20:59.013 --> 21:00.932
That's not the reason
I hate Venture.

21:01.015 --> 21:03.309
You're making way too big
a deal out of this.

21:03.393 --> 21:04.811
Well, then if it's not
a big deal

21:04.894 --> 21:06.521
we should see what
ARCH is all about.

21:06.604 --> 21:08.773
Not a big deal.
Little deal.

21:08.856 --> 21:11.567
Just scan it or whatever.

21:15.196 --> 21:17.699
Crap.
It's loading tons of data.

21:17.782 --> 21:19.200
It's downloading my data!

21:19.283 --> 21:20.994
Oh, if they get
into my porn!

21:21.077 --> 21:23.204
My spank bank
is super specific.

21:23.287 --> 21:25.123
It's very hard to explain.

21:25.206 --> 21:26.541
Shh. Shhh.

21:26.624 --> 21:29.419
Do you hear a car
or something?

21:33.131 --> 21:36.092
Minions!
Battle stations!

21:36.175 --> 21:37.927
Ready the!
Pfff.

21:38.011 --> 21:39.012
Ready the- ready...

21:39.095 --> 21:40.722
We have nothing to ready.

21:40.805 --> 21:43.182
We don't really have
battle stations anymore.

21:45.184 --> 21:54.944
♪♪

21:55.028 --> 21:59.365
Gentlemen,
nice to see you again so soon.

21:59.449 --> 22:02.952
What can ARCH do for you?

22:03.036 --> 22:04.287
Shoreleave: Alright, everybody.

22:04.370 --> 22:06.622
Bag 'em up,
and tag 'em up, people.

22:06.706 --> 22:10.293
Antagonists go in that pile,
scientists get the body-bags.

22:10.376 --> 22:13.671
We ran out of body-bags
so we're using tarps.

22:13.755 --> 22:17.008
Eh, if Fort Brocks says
tarps then it's tarps.

22:17.091 --> 22:18.968
Let's get 'em out of here.

22:19.052 --> 22:20.762
And you should be
wearing gloves.

22:20.845 --> 22:24.182
This is a crime scene,
formal attire only!

22:24.265 --> 22:26.893
Man: Sir! Unbidden counter
agents on premises!

22:26.976 --> 22:28.644
<i>Oo, Guten tag,</i>
<i>Frau Schmetterling.</i>

22:28.728 --> 22:31.647
I figured you'd show up
to our little barbecue.

22:31.731 --> 22:33.024
It's not one of ours.

22:33.107 --> 22:35.276
Yeah, when we didn't see
any anvils

22:35.359 --> 22:37.862
or guys with pianos
on their heads we figured

22:37.945 --> 22:40.406
this was a little too upscale
for the Guild.

22:40.490 --> 22:42.158
You, uh, know anything?

22:42.241 --> 22:43.951
The antagonist
is Brickfrog.

22:44.035 --> 22:45.661
He was a Guild Willy Loman

22:45.745 --> 22:48.164
punching the clock
till a couple days ago.

22:48.247 --> 22:49.999
I don't know how
he pulled this off.

22:50.083 --> 22:51.292
Who's the protagonist?

22:51.375 --> 22:53.002
Professor Vigo Dale.

22:53.086 --> 22:54.754
He was working on
a building material

22:54.837 --> 22:57.507
that's supposed
to be indestructible.

22:57.590 --> 23:00.051
Clearly he didn't use it
to build his lab.

23:00.134 --> 23:01.928
Because... hole.

23:02.011 --> 23:03.930
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
You can't do that!

23:04.013 --> 23:06.974
Evidence.
We need to analyze this.

23:07.058 --> 23:09.519
I'll save you some time.
They're dead people.

23:09.602 --> 23:10.895
Analyzed.

23:10.978 --> 23:13.856
Now put 'em down
before I put you down.

23:13.940 --> 23:15.441
Where's your money
on that?

23:15.525 --> 23:17.276
Oh, Brock, all the way.

23:17.360 --> 23:19.320
I'll go 20 bucks on it.

23:19.403 --> 23:20.947
Eh, can't call it.

23:21.030 --> 23:22.573
So,
you wanna share intel on this?

23:22.657 --> 23:25.326
Uh, yeah, sure but we gotta
keep it soft.

23:25.409 --> 23:26.619
Off the wire.

23:26.702 --> 23:28.412
Too much-
Red tape. Yeah, same here.

23:28.496 --> 23:32.291
Okay, why don't you take him
back to his haunted castle

23:32.375 --> 23:34.460
and let us
get back to work?

23:37.797 --> 23:38.923
Eh, could you take him?

23:39.006 --> 23:40.967
What, Red Death?
He's like 73.

23:41.050 --> 23:44.137
Are you joking?
He scares the crap out of me.

23:44.220 --> 23:46.556
Alright, fine,
yeah he's a little-

23:46.639 --> 23:50.268
just a little bit scary.

23:50.351 --> 23:51.978
Pretty sure
I could take him.

23:54.397 --> 23:56.190
Red,
what was all that about?

23:56.274 --> 23:58.067
Ah, simply a distraction.

23:58.151 --> 24:00.069
I found this phone
on one of the henchmen.

24:00.153 --> 24:01.821
That poor guy's hand
was blown off.

24:01.904 --> 24:03.281
No, of course not.

24:03.364 --> 24:05.783
I ripped it off his corpse
just in case he had

24:05.867 --> 24:08.452
a fingerprint lock
on his phone.

24:12.248 --> 24:14.834
Hibiscus tea with lemon
and acai berry?

24:14.917 --> 24:16.878
Oh, uh, thank you.

24:16.961 --> 24:18.629
Ah, Hench...

24:18.713 --> 24:20.464
You call them Acolytes.

24:20.548 --> 24:22.550
Thousands of them
are at your disposal.

24:22.633 --> 24:25.344
Just bring up the ARCH app on
your phone and enter an amount.

24:25.428 --> 24:27.471
Voila, instant army.

24:27.555 --> 24:30.558
Watch this:
Acolyte, Kill!

24:31.851 --> 24:33.102
- Oh, my God!
- What the!

24:33.186 --> 24:34.812
Acolyte, stop!

24:34.896 --> 24:36.480
Go ahead
and give her a kick.

24:36.564 --> 24:39.108
Just go ahead and kick her
right in the throat meat.

24:39.192 --> 24:40.776
Hard as you want.
What? No.

24:40.860 --> 24:43.529
I-I don't want to kick anyone
in the... throat meat.

24:43.613 --> 24:45.990
Your loss.

24:46.073 --> 24:48.117
Can I get a refresh!

24:49.952 --> 24:53.164
100,000 vanquished!

24:53.247 --> 24:54.582
Great job, team.
Now let's get back work.

24:54.665 --> 24:56.125
Our clients need us.

24:56.209 --> 24:58.586
There are one 100,000
rivalries in this city?

24:58.669 --> 25:00.379
City?

25:00.463 --> 25:01.923
ARCH is global.

25:02.006 --> 25:04.133
Seven continents, seven seas,
and five oceans.

25:04.217 --> 25:05.801
ARCH is the largest
and most effective

25:05.885 --> 25:07.637
antagonist solution
resource known.

25:07.720 --> 25:10.473
By who?
I've never even heard of ARCH.

25:10.556 --> 25:12.558
Because we're perfect.

25:12.642 --> 25:15.353
Quiet, efficient,
deadly.

25:15.436 --> 25:17.146
We work behind the scenes
for you.

25:17.230 --> 25:20.816
You get all the glory,
and we do all the dirty work.

25:20.900 --> 25:22.860
Let me show you around.

25:22.944 --> 25:24.946
So, what do you need?

25:25.029 --> 25:27.448
This isn't the Guild
of Calamitous Intent,

25:27.531 --> 25:29.617
this is ARCH.
We're here to help you.

25:29.700 --> 25:30.868
You need a grapple gun?

25:30.952 --> 25:32.620
Voila, grapple gun
brought to you

25:32.703 --> 25:34.163
by focused
beam teleportation

25:34.247 --> 25:36.874
exacted by thought accessed
inventory request.

25:36.958 --> 25:40.628
In short, if you can think
of it, we can get it for you.

25:40.711 --> 25:41.879
It's an ARCH exclusive.

25:41.963 --> 25:44.173
Totally want
that grapple gun.

25:44.257 --> 25:45.800
So, what do you need?

25:45.883 --> 25:48.094
Or did life already
give you everything.

25:48.177 --> 25:50.096
Never made a misstep
or a bad choice.

25:50.179 --> 25:53.849
Perfect life.
Or do you want more?

25:53.933 --> 25:57.103
You deserve everything
and I want to give it to you.

25:57.186 --> 26:00.606
This is your moment
to finally have it all.

26:00.690 --> 26:02.358
What do you need?

26:02.441 --> 26:03.985
Malcolm.

26:04.068 --> 26:05.444
Debra.

26:05.528 --> 26:07.029
Name it, Malcolm.

26:07.113 --> 26:09.031
What do you need?

26:09.115 --> 26:10.908
Well, for starters,
new costumes,

26:10.992 --> 26:12.785
and two of those
sliding poles!

26:12.868 --> 26:14.954
Like, for firemen,
you know, in batmen.

26:15.037 --> 26:16.664
All yours.

26:16.747 --> 26:19.166
Just pull out your porn-stuffed
phone and hit accept.

26:19.250 --> 26:20.793
It'll load everything
you need.

26:20.876 --> 26:23.462
We've done all the intel,
we've done all the research.

26:23.546 --> 26:25.214
We know what you want...

26:25.298 --> 26:27.216
even if you don't.

26:27.300 --> 26:29.427
Give me your phone.

26:29.510 --> 26:30.594
Don't go
into the gallery.

26:30.678 --> 26:32.430
I'm not gonna
look at your porn.

26:32.513 --> 26:34.640
Oh, you have no idea how much
you don't wanna see his porn.

26:34.724 --> 26:37.143
Just scroll down to the bottom
and hit accept.

26:40.271 --> 26:42.857
Done.

26:42.940 --> 26:45.735
Jefferson:
Alright, Chicago!

26:45.818 --> 26:47.111
Makin' good time.

26:47.194 --> 26:48.404
We get an early
start tomorrow,

26:48.487 --> 26:49.530
we'll there by mid-day.

26:49.613 --> 26:50.948
W-wait, we're gonna stop?

26:51.032 --> 26:53.034
We can't stop!
What about Hank?

26:53.117 --> 26:54.869
Shoulda thought of that
before you poached the pooty.

26:54.952 --> 26:56.370
"Poached the p-poo-?"

26:56.454 --> 26:57.955
Stealing your own brother's
girlfriend, man.

26:58.039 --> 27:00.458
That's lowdown.
You told?!

27:00.541 --> 27:02.418
Don't you have a vow of secrecy
or something?

27:02.501 --> 27:04.587
I am not
your Catholic priest.

27:04.670 --> 27:06.088
Know what kinda
people do that?

27:06.172 --> 27:08.090
Take other folks' lives
for their own?

27:08.174 --> 27:09.467
Vampire people.

27:09.550 --> 27:12.219
Oh, don't be so hard on the boy,
Jefferson.

27:12.303 --> 27:13.554
He's tormented enough.

27:13.637 --> 27:15.556
Alright, sorry.

27:15.639 --> 27:18.017
Ugh, I'm just beat.

27:18.100 --> 27:20.102
I got a place
we can crash nearby.

27:28.194 --> 27:30.863
This does not
look like a motel.

27:30.946 --> 27:33.783
You want to work pro-bono,
we can't afford one.

27:33.866 --> 27:36.619
This was my old base
of operations back in the day.

27:36.702 --> 27:39.580
Uh, I like your
new place better.

27:39.663 --> 27:41.082
Man: Jefferson Twilight!

27:41.165 --> 27:42.416
Ah!

27:42.500 --> 27:44.168
What're you doing here?

27:46.837 --> 27:48.255
Clayton!

27:48.339 --> 27:50.049
Just passing though
on our way to Colorado.

27:50.132 --> 27:51.967
Got any room
for some overnight guests?

27:52.051 --> 27:53.636
We've still got your room.

27:53.719 --> 27:57.640
C'mon the heck up, fellas.

27:57.723 --> 28:01.894
So, you two must be the rest of
the famous Order of the Triad.

28:01.977 --> 28:03.687
Only myself.

28:03.771 --> 28:07.525
Our tertiary member is back
at our New York headquarters.

28:07.608 --> 28:09.693
Oooo.
The boy here is our...

28:09.777 --> 28:11.153
client.

28:11.237 --> 28:12.446
Ah!

28:12.530 --> 28:14.657
Heya, Seth. S'up?

28:14.740 --> 28:16.826
Oh, hey, Jefferson!

28:16.909 --> 28:18.828
Long time.

28:18.911 --> 28:20.454
Aw, shit.

28:20.538 --> 28:23.124
Guys!
We have roaches!

28:23.207 --> 28:26.377
So are you guys, like,
Mr. Jefferson's old team?

28:26.460 --> 28:27.670
Nah, no, no, no,
we were never a team.

28:27.753 --> 28:29.171
Oh, we're not a team.

28:29.255 --> 28:31.882
It's more of a shared
live work space deal.

28:31.966 --> 28:35.177
We're all obsessive loners
who need the space and privacy

28:35.261 --> 28:36.387
of an abandoned factory.

28:36.470 --> 28:38.431
But like to keep
expenses down.

28:38.514 --> 28:40.266
Aaaaand here you are.

28:40.349 --> 28:41.350
Just like you left it.

28:41.434 --> 28:42.935
Ah, thanks, again, man.

28:43.018 --> 28:45.104
Hey, you wanna grab a nightcap
before we turn in?

28:45.187 --> 28:47.022
Nah, you know me.

28:47.106 --> 28:48.607
Night's my busy time.

28:51.485 --> 28:54.405
Think you packed enough stuff?

28:54.488 --> 28:57.032
One must be prepared
for anything.

28:57.116 --> 28:59.785
And my cloak gets all wrinkly
if I wear it in the car.

28:59.869 --> 29:01.328
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:01.412 --> 29:03.205
I'll take the couch.
You two can share the bed.

29:03.289 --> 29:04.457
We're leavin'
at first light.

29:05.708 --> 29:07.001
Hey.

29:07.084 --> 29:09.336
You blocked
my battle van in.

29:18.762 --> 29:21.891
<i>Gracias, señor!</i>

29:21.974 --> 29:23.476
Okay, Hank.

29:23.559 --> 29:25.102
Ready for this?

29:25.186 --> 29:27.396
Huh, well that's new.

29:27.480 --> 29:30.149
Hmmm. Didn't plan for this
contingency.

29:30.232 --> 29:31.484
If only I'd packed
my grapple gun.

29:31.567 --> 29:32.735
Damn it!
We should turn back.

29:32.818 --> 29:35.154
He-eh- I got this one.

29:40.117 --> 29:42.036
What the... ?

29:42.119 --> 29:44.747
W-what happened to it all?

29:44.830 --> 29:47.166
A-all those memories,
my whole life!

29:47.249 --> 29:49.585
And it's just one big...

50:41.836 --> 50:43.337
Oh, language shmanguage!

50:43.421 --> 50:46.674
Where have you been
all my life?

50:46.758 --> 50:50.094
Hm. Right.

50:50.178 --> 50:53.681
'Guess you're gonna want to hear
the whole sordid story, huh?

50:53.765 --> 50:57.852
Billy: <i>Alright, Doc, we figured</i>
<i>out what's going on.</i>

50:57.935 --> 50:59.645
<i>The magnets in</i>
<i>the Pods' speakers</i>

50:59.729 --> 51:02.064
<i>are made of cutting edge</i>
<i>super-conductors.</i>

51:02.148 --> 51:04.400
<i>And, thanks</i>
<i>to a software glitch-</i>

51:04.484 --> 51:06.611
White: <i>Not my fault.</i>
<i>It's your fault.</i>

51:06.694 --> 51:08.571
<i>When the volume goes up,</i>
<i>so do they</i>

51:08.654 --> 51:11.324
<i>by generating</i>
<i>a powerful magnetic field.</i>

51:11.407 --> 51:13.034
It's actually
kind of amazing.

51:13.117 --> 51:17.079
We accidentally built a
miniature anti-gravity engine.

51:17.163 --> 51:18.873
<i>Go Team Venture.</i>

51:18.956 --> 51:20.333
<i>So can White</i>
<i>fix the glitch?</i>

51:20.416 --> 51:21.709
Not a problem.

51:21.793 --> 51:23.461
If I could get into
the software that is.

51:23.544 --> 51:26.422
But someone locked me
out of the system, so...

51:26.506 --> 51:28.883
problem.
<i>So what do I do?</i>
<i>Cut the power?</i>

51:28.966 --> 51:30.384
That's the last thing
you want to do!

51:30.468 --> 51:32.970
VenTech would plummet
like a bag of hot rocks!

51:33.054 --> 51:36.265
Or, you know,
a 500,000 ton skyscraper.

51:36.349 --> 51:38.267
Exactly why I'm getting
the hell out of here,

51:38.351 --> 51:39.769
if Hatred would get
his fat ass

51:39.852 --> 51:41.062
up to the hangar already.

51:42.980 --> 51:46.067
I... stairs...

51:46.150 --> 51:48.152
Doc, from that height,
if VenTech crashes down

51:48.236 --> 51:50.154
it'll take out
half of Manhattan!

51:50.238 --> 51:52.323
<i>Well, I definitely don't want</i>
<i>to be in it when that happens.</i>

51:52.406 --> 51:53.908
No, you can't
let that happen!

51:53.991 --> 51:56.911
Y-Y-You just can't bail,
you have to fix this!

51:56.994 --> 51:59.247
You have a responsibility,
we all do!

51:59.330 --> 52:00.832
This is our fault!

52:00.915 --> 52:03.251
I didn't even want to make
these goddamn things!

52:03.334 --> 52:06.587
You people talked me into this
"lifestyle products" crap!

52:06.671 --> 52:09.173
I was happier as a middling
super-scientist

52:09.257 --> 52:10.633
in the middle of nowhere!

52:12.009 --> 52:13.803
<i>You done feeling sorry</i>
<i>for yourself?</i>

52:13.886 --> 52:16.556
Yeah.
What do we do?

52:16.639 --> 52:19.559
Your only hope is to shut
the Helper pods down manually,

52:19.642 --> 52:22.520
one by one,
until you start to level off.

52:22.603 --> 52:26.399
Then gradually turn more off
to control your descent.

52:26.482 --> 52:29.026
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>And how do I do that?</i>

52:29.110 --> 52:33.072
Uh, we've found shooting them
to be pretty effective.

52:33.155 --> 52:35.199
Yeah, but the thing is, with all
that electromagnetic energy-

52:36.659 --> 52:38.703
Doc? Doc?!

52:38.786 --> 52:40.621
Billy?
Hello, Billy?

52:40.705 --> 52:41.956
I lost you.

52:42.039 --> 52:43.958
Hello?

52:44.041 --> 52:46.586
Uh, you get all that,
Hatred?

52:46.669 --> 52:49.297
<i>Turn around and head</i>
<i>back downstairs.</i>

52:49.380 --> 52:51.799
<i>I'll meet you by</i>
<i>the mezzanine elevator.</i>

52:51.883 --> 52:53.467
Sgt. Hatred:

52:54.969 --> 52:56.178
Hey, hey, hey!
Help us!

52:56.262 --> 52:57.513
Help us!
Get us outta here!

52:57.597 --> 52:59.432
Help us, baldy!
Please take us with you!

53:01.017 --> 53:03.978
You're gonna shoot 'em down?!
You can't do that!

53:04.061 --> 53:06.647
If it's between them
and millions of citizens

53:06.731 --> 53:09.525
nestled snuggly in their beds,
I can and will.

53:09.609 --> 53:11.861
The second they tumble
into Uncle Sam's airspace.

53:11.944 --> 53:13.195
Just give me a chance.

53:13.279 --> 53:15.156
Put me in a shuttle
and get me up there!

53:15.239 --> 53:16.824
No dice, Samson.

53:16.908 --> 53:19.535
This is one cluster you can't
un- with a Bowie knife.

53:19.619 --> 53:21.329
ARCH ain't playing
by the rules.

53:21.412 --> 53:22.997
We're in uncharted
territory here.

53:23.080 --> 53:24.790
Uh, not entirely true,
Sir.

53:24.874 --> 53:27.752
September 1962,
Fantastic Four number six.

53:27.835 --> 53:29.670
Dr. Doom lifted
the Baxter Building

53:29.754 --> 53:32.340
into space with a device
called "The Grabber."

53:32.423 --> 53:34.342
Really? And how'd ol' Reed
and F.F.

53:34.425 --> 53:36.093
get outta
that sticky wicket?

53:36.177 --> 53:37.303
They had help, sir.

53:37.386 --> 53:39.639
From Prince Namor,
the Sub-Mariner.

53:39.722 --> 53:42.016
Hmph. Last I checked,
Dr. Venture

53:42.099 --> 53:43.684
doesn't have
one of those, does he?

53:43.768 --> 53:46.020
No. He's only one of the
foremost

53:46.103 --> 53:47.855
super-scientists
on the planet,

53:47.939 --> 53:50.232
with a seasoned super-soldier
at his side

53:50.316 --> 53:52.693
who used to be one
of ours.

53:52.777 --> 53:55.071
That's a team
you can bet on.

53:58.532 --> 54:00.076
Oh, you are adorable.
Oh, you guys suck!

54:00.159 --> 54:02.328
Fine, if you don't trust them
to fix this,

54:02.411 --> 54:05.414
then trust the agent
we have working the ARCH angle.

54:05.498 --> 54:09.085
If ARCH is pulling the strings
here, she'll cut 'em.

54:18.469 --> 54:19.804
Alright,
I'm gonna look around.

54:19.887 --> 54:20.972
Watch your head.

54:22.807 --> 54:27.895
Eh, looks like an episode
of "Intervention" in here.

54:27.979 --> 54:30.481
Or an episode of "C.S.I."

54:30.564 --> 54:33.567
Man, someone is obsessed
with your husband.

54:33.651 --> 54:35.736
Oh, my God.
How'd she even get these?

54:35.820 --> 54:37.863
That's a picture of us
eating dinner.

54:37.947 --> 54:40.366
There's one of you
both asleep in your bed.

54:40.449 --> 54:42.243
Ew. It's like she
was always there.

54:42.326 --> 54:44.453
I was.

54:44.537 --> 54:46.998
I was there for all of it.

54:47.081 --> 54:50.251
It should have been me.

54:50.334 --> 54:52.586
You dropped your gun
when you landed on me.

54:52.670 --> 54:54.422
Aw, nice job, you two.

54:54.505 --> 54:56.674
Now the knife you keep
in your boot, please.

54:56.757 --> 54:58.050
I know you.

54:58.134 --> 54:59.927
You're that girl that my husband
used to date.

55:00.011 --> 55:02.304
Debbie, right?
You're Debbie!

55:02.388 --> 55:04.682
Ha, trying to erase me
and steal my husband?

55:04.765 --> 55:07.268
Okay, first of all, it's Debra,
not Debbie,

55:07.351 --> 55:09.353
and second of all,
you got it all wrong.

55:09.437 --> 55:12.398
The crime scene cliché here
tells a different story.

55:12.481 --> 55:14.817
Yeah, it started as
kind of a checklist,

55:14.900 --> 55:18.529
then I had all these pictures,
then I got some... yarn.

55:18.612 --> 55:20.364
You never set out to make
an "I'm crazy" wall,

55:20.448 --> 55:21.824
but ya know.

55:21.907 --> 55:23.617
They happen.
It's an organic thing.

55:23.701 --> 55:27.413
You insinuated yourself
into the sanctity of matrimony.

55:27.496 --> 55:30.082
I took some pictures,
go cry about it.

55:30.166 --> 55:32.376
Who is the talking horse?
Daisy.

55:32.460 --> 55:35.087
Well, Daisy, why don't you
sit down and shut up,

55:35.171 --> 55:36.964
because this has
nothing to do with you.

55:37.048 --> 55:39.425
And I'm not obsessed
with The Monarch. Seriously?

55:39.508 --> 55:42.053
Right now that evil genius
and his brilliant arch enemy

55:42.136 --> 55:45.222
are flying haplessly into space
in overpriced real estate.

55:45.306 --> 55:47.266
No offense to morons,
but

55:47.349 --> 55:49.477
your husband is their king.

55:49.560 --> 55:51.187
I don't know what you
even see in him.

55:51.270 --> 55:52.897
Daisy: Of course!

55:52.980 --> 55:54.607
It's you.

55:54.690 --> 55:57.443
She's obsessed with you.

55:57.526 --> 55:59.820
Daisy, seriously,
shut your mouth.

55:59.904 --> 56:02.865
I have no problem
shooting a robot horse.

56:05.576 --> 56:09.205
Bobbi: The year
was 19-I'd-rather-not-say,

56:09.288 --> 56:11.624
and I was shooting
"Follow That Bikini"

56:11.707 --> 56:13.667
on the Isotope lot.

56:13.751 --> 56:15.628
Your grandfather was consulting

56:15.711 --> 56:18.756
on some hush-hush project
on the next sound stage,

56:18.839 --> 56:22.927
and I guess our little movie
piqued his curiosity.

56:23.010 --> 56:25.846
He told me he knew a much
more convincing way

56:25.930 --> 56:27.389
to make me look invisible,

56:27.473 --> 56:30.559
and invited me back to
his compound to show me.

56:33.104 --> 56:35.439
Well, it sure was convincing!

56:35.523 --> 56:37.858
And so was Jonas.

56:37.942 --> 56:39.527
I ended up staying the night,

56:39.610 --> 56:42.321
which is how I met
your father.

56:42.404 --> 56:45.491
And that's when you fell in love
and had me and Dean?

56:45.574 --> 56:46.951
No, cuckoo-pants.

56:47.034 --> 56:49.537
He was just a little kid
at the time.

56:49.620 --> 56:52.540
Adorable little Rusty.

56:52.623 --> 56:54.500
Such a sweetie.

56:54.583 --> 56:56.293
'Little bit sad, too.

56:56.377 --> 56:59.839
I think he asked
if I was his mommy.

56:59.922 --> 57:03.884
Anyway, "Follow That Bikini"
was a certified bomb.

57:03.968 --> 57:05.886
Talk about a fading star!

57:05.970 --> 57:08.764
I couldn't even make it through
an audition without fading.

57:08.848 --> 57:13.102
I begged Jonas to fix me,
but instead,

57:13.185 --> 57:16.814
he and his O.S.I.
cronies offered me a job.

57:16.897 --> 57:19.608
And just like that,
I went from an actress...

57:19.692 --> 57:20.776
to a spy.

57:20.860 --> 57:22.153
Cool!

57:22.236 --> 57:24.488
It ain't like it
is in the movies, kid.

57:24.572 --> 57:27.032
They threw me
to the wolves.

57:27.116 --> 57:29.326
But I guess they knew
their wolves,

57:29.410 --> 57:33.789
because it wasn't long before
I caught the eye of the alpha.

57:33.873 --> 57:36.000
Force Majeure.

57:36.083 --> 57:39.253
Number One on the O.S.I.'s
Most Wanted List,

57:39.336 --> 57:41.547
Sovereign of the Guild
of Calamitous Intent

57:41.630 --> 57:46.010
and Jonas Venture's arch enemy.

57:46.093 --> 57:48.429
Gaining his trust
was easy-peasy.

57:48.512 --> 57:52.224
My "special talent" made me
a natural for super-crime.

57:52.308 --> 57:56.812
And truth is, I was attracted
the Guild lifestyle...

57:56.896 --> 57:59.106
and to him, meow.

57:59.190 --> 58:01.525
It didn't matter how many
dumb names

58:01.609 --> 58:03.903
I crossed off their
Most Wanted list,

58:03.986 --> 58:06.780
the O.S.I.
only wanted Force Majeure.

58:06.864 --> 58:09.783
But how could I betray the man
I'd fallen in love with?

58:09.867 --> 58:11.452
The father of my child?

58:11.535 --> 58:13.454
Whoa!

58:13.537 --> 58:15.789
Force Majeure
is my real father?!

58:15.873 --> 58:18.626
No, Hank.
I was talking about my daughter.

58:18.709 --> 58:20.628
I have a sister?!

58:20.711 --> 58:22.379
Does my dad know?

58:22.463 --> 58:24.882
Your father comes later.

58:24.965 --> 58:27.176
After Force Majeure
was usurped,

58:27.259 --> 58:30.262
I knew I was next on
the new Sovereign's hit list.

58:30.346 --> 58:34.183
So I grabbed little Debbie
and got the heck outta Dodge.

58:34.266 --> 58:36.185
And after a decade on the run,

58:36.268 --> 58:38.854
I just wanted to live
a normal life again.

58:38.938 --> 58:42.149
Jonas was dead by then,
so I found your father

58:42.233 --> 58:43.901
and asked for his help.

58:43.984 --> 58:45.402
Aaaand... ?

58:45.486 --> 58:48.447
And... He helped me.
That's it.

58:48.530 --> 58:50.741
That's it?!
Nothing else happened

58:50.824 --> 58:53.494
between your father
and me, Hank.

58:53.577 --> 58:55.079
I'm not your mother.

58:55.162 --> 58:58.165
And... I've already told you
all of this.

58:58.249 --> 58:59.875
W-What do you mean?

58:59.959 --> 59:02.836
This ain't the first time
you've come looking for me, kid.

59:02.920 --> 59:04.338
Heck,
it isn't even the second.

59:04.421 --> 59:05.839
Wha...

59:08.676 --> 59:11.845
♪♪

59:15.349 --> 59:17.059
Awwwwww sh--

59:17.142 --> 59:18.519
Hank? Hank?!

59:18.602 --> 59:20.229
Buddy,
fetch the smelling salts!

59:21.730 --> 59:23.524
No need, Buddy.

59:23.607 --> 59:27.236
I shall take it from here.

59:27.319 --> 59:30.864
Monarch:
I can't believe we stayed for
your over-the-hill rent-a-cop.

59:30.948 --> 59:33.284
Why didn't we just leave him
and get the hell out of here?

59:33.367 --> 59:37.162
We didn't stay for Hatred,
we stayed because if we leave,

59:37.246 --> 59:38.706
the building'll kill
a bunch of people.

59:38.789 --> 59:40.582
So?
Dude.

59:40.666 --> 59:42.793
And that's why
I'm always the hero

59:42.876 --> 59:44.086
and you're always
the villain.

59:44.169 --> 59:46.297
Oh, don't flatter yourself,
slick.

59:46.380 --> 59:47.715
And don't think this is
some buddy-buddy

59:47.798 --> 59:49.216
comic book
team-up crap.

59:49.300 --> 59:50.801
I still hate you.
Yeah?

59:50.884 --> 59:52.469
Well I hate you, too.

59:52.553 --> 59:54.430
But I don't walk around
obsessing about it all day.

59:54.513 --> 59:56.974
It's not why I put on my
speedsuit every morning.

59:59.435 --> 01:00:00.936
Why'd you Debbie?
Debbie?

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.813
Debbie who?
Debbie St. Simone!

01:00:02.896 --> 01:00:04.565
She was my girlfriend.

01:00:04.648 --> 01:00:07.401
Debbie from 20 years
ago Debbie?

01:00:07.484 --> 01:00:09.361
We never
voh-dee-oh-doh-doh'ed,

01:00:09.445 --> 01:00:11.822
I did some work for her
and her mother.

01:00:14.783 --> 01:00:16.035
Fine.

01:00:19.705 --> 01:00:22.541
Hey, uh, you hear this crap
about how we might be related?

01:00:22.624 --> 01:00:24.585
Ridiculous.
Ridiculous, right?

01:00:24.668 --> 01:00:25.753
Yeah, that's what I said.

01:00:25.836 --> 01:00:27.004
I mean, maybe you go back like

01:00:27.087 --> 01:00:28.630
20 generations
or something.

01:00:28.714 --> 01:00:30.632
Sure, sure.
Yeah, they say like
half the world

01:00:30.716 --> 01:00:32.551
can trace their roots
to Genghis Khan.

01:00:32.634 --> 01:00:34.094
Exactly.
Exactly.

01:00:36.263 --> 01:00:39.475
Then again, my dad
did get around.

01:00:39.558 --> 01:00:41.560
And he did know your mom,
so...

01:00:44.438 --> 01:00:46.023
Say it again!

01:00:46.106 --> 01:00:47.441
Say that about my mother
one more time!

01:00:47.524 --> 01:00:49.276
I will kick you in your
throat meat!

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.111

You've been waiting all day

Okay, it's gonna be loud
in there,

01:01:09.421 --> 01:01:10.798

a little disorienting.

Mr. Jefferson's kind of
a conduit between realms,

Okay.

you launch
my husband into space,

and the Invisible Debbie?"

01:04:21.071 --> 01:04:23.824

20-year revenge plan

01:04:25.534 --> 01:04:28.495
When?!
Seriously, Sheila, when?

01:04:28.579 --> 01:04:30.497
You went from Truckules,
to Phantom Limb,

01:04:30.581 --> 01:04:32.040
right to The Monarch.

01:04:32.124 --> 01:04:34.501

non grata!

01:05:44.863 --> 01:05:45.989

with The Monarch?

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:54.456

you slept with Dr. Venture.

Gross, no, ew.

01:05:57.125 --> 01:05:59.044

Ew!
God, that was business.

Rusty just took away my mom's
invisibility and gave it to me.

01:06:04.341 --> 01:06:05.884
And I gave him my...

01:06:05.967 --> 01:06:07.969
stuff I wasn't planning
on using.

01:06:08.053 --> 01:06:09.846

I slept with Rusty.

01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:11.264
Well, then why did you
break up with him?

01:06:11.348 --> 01:06:12.891
Please!

mesosphere and the thermosphere,

01:17:30.443 --> 01:17:32.737
All stitched up!
He'll be fine.

01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:35.073
They're just finishing up
the blood transfusion.

01:17:35.156 --> 01:17:36.532
I was so worried.

01:17:36.616 --> 01:17:38.868
I'm just glad he had
his brother's blood.

01:17:38.951 --> 01:17:41.204
Brother's blood?
That's what you guys think?

01:17:41.287 --> 01:17:43.081
-Brothers?
-They are not brothers?

01:17:43.164 --> 01:17:44.374
Ben:
They are not brothers.

01:17:44.457 --> 01:17:45.833
They're the same guy.

01:17:45.917 --> 01:17:48.127
Or clones of the same guy,
at least.

01:17:48.211 --> 01:17:51.798
Other than a pinch of baboon DNA
we spliced into R-22

01:17:51.881 --> 01:17:54.759
to counteract the premature
balding, they're identical.

01:17:54.842 --> 01:17:56.761
They're <i>both</i> Rusty clones.

01:17:56.844 --> 01:17:59.180
Monarch has baboon in him?

01:17:59.263 --> 01:18:00.973
-Cool!
-Two percent!

01:18:01.057 --> 01:18:03.142
I told Jonas, "Don't put
that monkey junk in there,

01:18:03.226 --> 01:18:05.436
it'll make him more aggressive,"
but did he listen?

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:06.896
Noooo.

01:18:06.979 --> 01:18:09.816
Pawned R-22 off
on that Morpho couple.

01:18:09.899 --> 01:18:12.276
Couldn't have kids of their own,
poor bastards.

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:14.362
Felt sorry for 'em.

01:18:14.445 --> 01:18:16.114
Doc:
Uh, where are the boys?

01:18:16.197 --> 01:18:19.242
I gotta blow their little minds.

01:18:19.325 --> 01:18:20.576
Again.

01:18:27.834 --> 01:18:29.627
Dr. Girlfriend:
How's my king butterfly?

01:18:29.710 --> 01:18:31.671
S-Sweetie?
W-Where are you?

01:18:31.754 --> 01:18:33.714
I'm, uh, invisible.

01:18:33.798 --> 01:18:35.049
Your ex-girlfriend?

01:18:35.133 --> 01:18:36.342
Yeah, she gave me
some of her blood.

01:18:36.426 --> 01:18:37.718
It should wear off soon.

01:18:37.802 --> 01:18:41.264
Eh, I-I'm so sorry
about all that.

01:18:41.347 --> 01:18:44.725
Every stupid idea I have,
I just- I just dig in.

01:18:44.809 --> 01:18:46.727
You dig in.
I know who you are, baby.

01:18:46.811 --> 01:18:50.064
Oh, so you know
I'm Dr. Venture plus baboon?

01:18:50.148 --> 01:18:51.732
baboon.

01:18:51.816 --> 01:18:53.526
You are The Monarch.

01:18:53.609 --> 01:18:55.820
That Dr. Venture
makes my skin crawl

01:18:55.903 --> 01:18:58.739
And you make feel like
the luckiest person alive.

01:18:58.823 --> 01:19:00.825
You're not the same.

01:19:00.908 --> 01:19:02.326
So, what now?

01:19:02.410 --> 01:19:05.079
Spent my entire life
arching... me.

01:19:05.163 --> 01:19:06.330
I'm pathetic.

01:19:06.414 --> 01:19:07.999
Honey,
you're a Greek myth.

01:19:08.082 --> 01:19:09.876
You're pitted
in the eternal battle

01:19:09.959 --> 01:19:11.961
against the worst aspects
of yourself.

01:19:12.044 --> 01:19:15.006
The Guild, it can't touch
a rivalry like that.

01:19:15.089 --> 01:19:17.383
He's all yours,
if ya want.

01:19:17.467 --> 01:19:19.051
Or...

01:19:19.135 --> 01:19:20.303
maybe I should just...

01:19:20.386 --> 01:19:21.679
give this all up.

01:19:21.762 --> 01:19:23.139
It's your choice.

01:19:23.222 --> 01:19:25.641
I'll stand by you
either way.

01:19:25.725 --> 01:19:27.393
Tell me what to do.

01:19:30.813 --> 01:19:33.191
Hey, kid,
wanna give you something.

01:19:34.942 --> 01:19:37.570
Your Grandpap gave me this
before your dad was born.

01:19:37.653 --> 01:19:39.238
Is it more dumb news?

01:19:39.322 --> 01:19:41.032
You gonna tell me
who my mom <i>isn't?</i>

01:19:41.115 --> 01:19:42.992
Nah, just a watch.

01:19:43.075 --> 01:19:46.120
GMT Master,
Venture blue dial.

01:19:46.204 --> 01:19:47.830
Tells the time
in two time zones.

01:19:47.914 --> 01:19:49.457
It's heavy.

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:51.876
Yeah, that fourth hand there?
Little date window?

01:19:51.959 --> 01:19:53.961
Those are called
complications.

01:19:54.045 --> 01:19:56.464
Complications
make a watch special.

01:19:56.547 --> 01:19:59.550
The more complications,
the more valuable.

01:19:59.634 --> 01:20:02.011
Read the engraving
Jonas put on the back there.

01:20:02.094 --> 01:20:04.222
"EE-LIE-GHEE TUA"?

01:20:04.305 --> 01:20:05.723
Eh, close enough.

01:20:05.806 --> 01:20:08.434
It's Latin for
"choose your family."

01:20:08.518 --> 01:20:11.604
Blood doesn't make a family.
Love does.

01:20:11.687 --> 01:20:13.439
Your Grandpap knew that.

01:20:14.774 --> 01:20:16.484
Choose your family.

01:20:16.567 --> 01:20:19.820

make it special.

loves you.

01:20:39.549 --> 01:20:40.800

I love you, Pop.

Watch the arm, son.

Oh, come on!
