WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:25.724 --> 01:28.625
Another day wasted in this lonely tower.

01:28.994 --> 01:31.895
Me, Mallek,
the mighty wizard of Stone Mountain,

01:32.031 --> 01:35.262
held prisoner by the
memory of the one I love:

01:36.602 --> 01:38.092
beautiful Teela.

01:38.370 --> 01:42.500
How I've longed to see you
again and make you mine,

01:43.042 --> 01:44.509
but you rejected me.

01:46.879 --> 01:50.610
Preferring to join the royal
guard than to become my wife.

01:51.684 --> 01:55.313
It's not fair!
My magic can get me anything I want,

01:55.521 --> 01:56.954
except her...

01:57.123 --> 01:58.715
Mallek, are you alright?

02:00.459 --> 02:02.154
Karyn, I didn't call for you.

02:02.628 --> 02:05.654
But I heard a noise.
I thought you needed help.

02:05.798 --> 02:07.090
Well you thought wrong, assistant.

02:07.099 --> 02:09.896
Now leave me.
We'll go over your magic lessons later.

02:10.136 --> 02:11.433
Yes, Mallek.

02:11.904 --> 02:13.929
If I could go to see Teela...

02:14.106 --> 02:16.870
again, but she'd only
reject me like before.

02:17.042 --> 02:20.671
Still, I wish she could be mine,
There is no price...

02:20.846 --> 02:23.542
I would not pay to make
that dream come true.

02:25.117 --> 02:27.483
Greetings, Mallek.

02:27.887 --> 02:28.751
Who are you?

02:28.954 --> 02:32.981
I am Lokus, a special
messenger sent by my master.

02:33.225 --> 02:35.455
Who is this "master" of yours?

02:35.728 --> 02:37.628
What does his name matter?

02:37.763 --> 02:42.359
The important thing is,
that he knows how you feel about Teela...

02:42.568 --> 02:45.093
I can help you, make her yours.

02:45.471 --> 02:46.938
Really? How?

02:47.206 --> 02:50.039
Well, there is a price, involved.

02:50.376 --> 02:52.936
A rather high price.

02:53.913 --> 02:55.244
I'll give you anything.

02:55.447 --> 02:58.439
Well in that case, we have a deal.

02:59.618 --> 03:00.312
Done.

03:01.954 --> 03:03.046
What was that?

03:03.289 --> 03:06.452
A mere formality to seal our agreement...

03:06.592 --> 03:08.355
and now to work!

03:22.708 --> 03:25.336
Wait! What are you doing?
Stop this at once!

03:25.544 --> 03:28.058
It's all part of the bargain, Mallek.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.868
The bargain you agreed to.

03:30.082 --> 03:32.550
I never agreed to wiping
out those people's crops.

03:32.718 --> 03:34.587
If you won't end this madness,

03:34.612 --> 03:36.542
I'll use my magic to stop it.

03:40.025 --> 03:42.627
Consider this a warning, Mallek.

03:42.652 --> 03:45.009
From now on, I'm in charge.

03:52.771 --> 03:56.172
Oh Mallek, it's like that
awful creature owns you.

04:00.246 --> 04:03.841
This is it, Orko.
I've had it with your silly parlor tricks.

04:03.983 --> 04:06.884
Sorry, Duncan.
I must have gotten my spells crossed.

04:12.591 --> 04:16.048
You got your spells... crossed?
Why, you...

04:16.195 --> 04:19.130
Wait a second. I can fix everything.

04:27.273 --> 04:28.638
Hey, what's going on?

04:28.807 --> 04:31.298
What's going on?
I've got a blizzard in my workshop.

04:31.510 --> 04:33.307
That's what's going on.

04:34.513 --> 04:36.913
Oh, I know what I did wrong.

04:40.386 --> 04:44.049
Next time, Orko,
save that trick for a hot summers day.

04:44.189 --> 04:47.215
I've got to meet Teela
for my combat lesson.

04:47.493 --> 04:50.326
Well, I guess I'll be going too.

04:50.562 --> 04:52.462
I suppose I'm going to clean up this mess.

04:52.831 --> 04:54.992
You will?  Gee thanks.

04:58.337 --> 05:02.569
You black-hearted villain.
Prepare to defend yourself!

05:07.012 --> 05:08.946
Hey, take it easy, will ya?

05:09.081 --> 05:10.810
Oh c'mon, Adam?

05:10.916 --> 05:13.510
I'm just trying to make
your combat lesson fun.

05:13.786 --> 05:17.688
What do I need lessons for?
Aren't you my bodyguard?

05:18.157 --> 05:20.489
If you had a little skill, Adam,

05:20.514 --> 05:22.845
you wouldn't need a bodyguard.

05:27.499 --> 05:30.229
Duh, it's no trick to be tough, Adam.

05:38.610 --> 05:41.477
Uh, you just gotta use your head. Oh.

05:43.148 --> 05:46.709
[laughs] Only you could make an
appearance like that, Ram-Man.

05:48.454 --> 05:51.981
Well, I always try to
make a good impression.

05:53.759 --> 05:54.783
Get it?

05:55.627 --> 05:58.130
I think the lesson's just about over.

05:58.130 --> 05:59.162
Great, come on, Ram-Man.

05:59.264 --> 06:01.061
Let's go have a bite at the palace kitchen.

06:16.582 --> 06:17.571
Oh, who?

06:17.983 --> 06:20.679
Forgive my sudden
intrusion, Captain Teela...

06:20.819 --> 06:22.377
But I must speak to you.

06:23.889 --> 06:25.379
Certainly, Mister uh...

06:25.724 --> 06:28.659
Lokus, ma'am.
I'm a farmer from Artanna...

06:28.861 --> 06:30.761
or I was a farmer until...

06:30.929 --> 06:33.489
until Mallek the Wizard of Stone...

06:33.632 --> 06:35.395
Mountain, destroyed our crops.

06:35.567 --> 06:37.535
Mallek?  It can't be.

06:37.836 --> 06:40.498
It's true, ma'am.
We were lucky to escape.

06:40.706 --> 06:43.004
But with one magical gesture...

06:43.175 --> 06:45.700
he blasted away the Stone Mountain dam...

06:45.911 --> 06:49.039
and wiped out our village.
-No, not Mallek.

06:49.615 --> 06:51.913
He would never use his
powers for destruction.

06:52.151 --> 06:54.346
But there's one more thing, Ma'am.

06:54.420 --> 06:57.821
He destroyed the dam out
of loneliness for you.

06:59.091 --> 07:00.285
Excuse me?

07:03.829 --> 07:06.696
The trap is baited and set...

07:06.999 --> 07:11.459
and soon,
both Malik and Teela will be mine.

07:23.215 --> 07:27.549
Uh, hey Adam? Would Cringer sit up
and beg for some food, huh?

07:28.587 --> 07:30.350
Come on, Cringer, come on:

07:30.522 --> 07:32.080
sit up and beg.

07:33.292 --> 07:35.823
Oh, the only thing I beg is that

07:35.848 --> 07:38.219
lout's pardon. Sit up and...

07:38.330 --> 07:39.991
beg indeed!

07:42.201 --> 07:42.929
Adam?

07:43.869 --> 07:45.945
There's been some trouble in Artanna and

07:45.970 --> 07:47.488
Mallek seems to be behind it.

07:47.639 --> 07:48.833
Mallek?  Hey...

07:48.974 --> 07:50.926
wasn't he your old boyfriend?

07:50.951 --> 07:52.161
He thought so.

07:52.344 --> 07:54.608
Well, uh, what do you want us to do?

07:55.247 --> 07:58.546
I could use your help, Ram-Man.
And Adam...

07:58.684 --> 08:01.881
please, ask my father if
he could locate He-Man.

08:02.221 --> 08:03.149
I'll need him too.

08:03.174 --> 08:04.770
Oh, won't I do just as well?

08:05.023 --> 08:07.287
Oh, please.
This is no time for jokes.

08:22.341 --> 08:24.639
By the power of Grayskull!

08:31.416 --> 08:35.216
I have the power!

08:58.610 --> 08:59.201
Hello.

09:02.114 --> 09:05.106
I... understand you were looking for me.

09:05.317 --> 09:07.251
Ah, am I glad to see you.

09:07.619 --> 09:10.213
Mallek the Wizard of
Stone Mountain is in trouble.

09:10.389 --> 09:11.185
Mallek?

09:11.690 --> 09:12.816
Uh, your old boyfriend?

09:12.991 --> 09:15.016
Don't you start in on it too.

09:15.193 --> 09:16.889
Are you gonna help us or not?

09:16.914 --> 09:18.550
[laughs] Lead on, Captain.

09:27.339 --> 09:30.365
That terrible creature, Lokus,
is responsible for this.

09:30.542 --> 09:32.442
I should never have listened to him.

09:34.446 --> 09:37.040
Still, once he helps me win Teela...

09:37.215 --> 09:40.514
I'll use my magic to set
everything right again.

09:40.619 --> 09:41.852
Mallek, I've seen what you

09:41.877 --> 09:43.203
and Lokus have been doing.

09:43.355 --> 09:45.257
I may just be your assistant,

09:45.282 --> 09:47.315
but I know that Lokus is evil.

09:47.693 --> 09:49.820
Send him away, before it's too late.

09:50.028 --> 09:52.826
She suspects too much.
I must get rid of her.

10:06.158 --> 10:07.158
Help!

10:14.953 --> 10:15.817
Karyn!

10:18.924 --> 10:19.583
No!

10:22.694 --> 10:26.994
Your will is mine now,
Mallek, you'll do as I say.

10:32.671 --> 10:36.732
Uh, y-you think your
boyfriend will be happy to see us?

10:37.109 --> 10:38.371
For the last time.

10:38.644 --> 10:42.774
Mallek was not nor will
he ever be my boyfriend.

10:43.215 --> 10:44.409
Help!

10:44.650 --> 10:45.878
Help!

10:46.151 --> 10:47.641
Help!

10:54.226 --> 10:55.853
Help!

11:00.098 --> 11:02.623
Use your blasters to frighten the monster!

11:05.237 --> 11:06.534
No, it might drop you!

11:06.838 --> 11:09.568
I'll be alright, trust me!

11:31.563 --> 11:33.656
Wings, appear at my command.

11:36.435 --> 11:37.527
That's some trick.

12:35.060 --> 12:37.858
Those are some power's you've got.
Who are you?

12:38.663 --> 12:41.097
I'm Karyn, Mallek's assistant.

12:41.399 --> 12:43.663
We'll talk after we're settled with him.

12:43.835 --> 12:46.770
From bones you came, to bones you return.

12:52.244 --> 12:53.766
Like I said before.

12:53.791 --> 12:55.260
Those are some powers.

12:59.518 --> 13:01.737
You're saying a demon is responsible

13:01.762 --> 13:03.501
for Mallek's actions, Karyn?

13:03.655 --> 13:07.523
Yes. Mallek follows Lokus' every command,

13:07.726 --> 13:10.456
and all out of love, for Teela.

13:11.363 --> 13:15.299
Oh no.
I thought he'd gotten over that.

13:15.734 --> 13:17.565
Duh, over what?

13:17.702 --> 13:18.502
Well...

13:18.904 --> 13:21.236
I guess I better tell you everything.

13:21.439 --> 13:23.373
Before I became Captain of the Guard...

13:23.542 --> 13:26.306
I spent several months studying
in the City of Wisdom...

13:26.478 --> 13:27.945
It was there, that I met Mallek...

13:28.113 --> 13:31.207
who was training to
become a master wizard.

13:32.150 --> 13:34.550
He always seemed like a nice enough fella.

13:36.721 --> 13:40.953
Such a beautiful girl deserves
the finest gown magic can produce.

13:42.627 --> 13:45.596
Though, he did have some
trouble controlling his magic.

13:51.069 --> 13:55.403
Mallek eventually improved his
magic and became a great sorcerer.

13:58.276 --> 14:00.417
But he couldn't believe
that I never thought

14:00.442 --> 14:02.202
of him as more than a casual friend...

14:02.547 --> 14:04.139
and that's the whole story.

14:04.382 --> 14:07.010
Some women would be honored
to have Mallek care for them.

14:07.252 --> 14:09.948
Like it or not,
I think you've got a rival.

14:10.155 --> 14:10.951
Greetings.

14:11.189 --> 14:13.089
I've been waiting for you, Teela.

14:17.562 --> 14:19.052
You, put her down!

14:21.967 --> 14:24.094
Mallek, let Teela go, at once!

14:24.603 --> 14:25.831
She is mine, He-Man.

14:26.004 --> 14:29.337
Heed my warning, and leave Stone Mountain.

14:30.642 --> 14:32.269
Not a chance.

14:35.580 --> 14:37.639
Mallek, this is ridiculous.

14:37.916 --> 14:39.440
Is something wrong, my love?

14:39.784 --> 14:41.775
Yes! Everything's wrong.

14:42.187 --> 14:44.678
You can't force me to
fall in love with you.

14:45.257 --> 14:46.952
Not in a way that's real.

14:47.125 --> 14:48.422
But you will love me in time.

14:50.095 --> 14:53.758
Time, is the one thing
you've run out of, Mallek.

14:57.035 --> 14:59.128
Wait! Wha... What's happening?

14:59.437 --> 15:02.167
As I said, wizard, your time is up.

15:02.407 --> 15:05.740
Now you have to pay me
for bringing you Teela.

15:06.077 --> 15:07.635
What does he mean?

15:07.812 --> 15:09.939
What do you owe that creature?

15:10.115 --> 15:12.811
Mallek was so busy thinking of you...

15:12.984 --> 15:16.249
he never stopped to consider
the fee, for my services.

15:17.322 --> 15:18.880
Wha.. what do you want from me?

15:19.324 --> 15:22.225
Your soul, wizard.

15:24.562 --> 15:27.030
My soul?
-Oh no!

15:27.432 --> 15:31.994
It's true! You did make a
deal with that monster...

15:32.337 --> 15:36.569
and now to call my master
to take possession of you both.

15:38.510 --> 15:40.876
Oh, master of darkness...

15:41.112 --> 15:42.773
lord of all evil things...

15:42.948 --> 15:44.210
come forth!

15:44.316 --> 15:47.251
Your servant awaits.

15:50.388 --> 15:54.085
Mallek, I have come for you.

15:58.229 --> 16:00.424
Who dares intrude?

16:03.935 --> 16:05.163
My name is He-Man.

16:05.537 --> 16:06.765
He-Man.

16:07.138 --> 16:10.039
So we face each other at last.

16:10.342 --> 16:12.708
Who - or what are you?

16:12.944 --> 16:17.711
I am the master of fear
and destroyer of hope.

16:18.016 --> 16:22.453
The enemy of mankind
throughout the universe.

16:22.921 --> 16:28.359
Spirit of Evil: Mortal, I am Evil, itself.

16:45.510 --> 16:48.152
Miserable animal!

16:48.177 --> 16:51.439
You cannot harm me.

16:51.816 --> 16:53.647
Duh, I'll stop him.

17:05.630 --> 17:11.193
Fools, you just delay my ultimate victory.

17:11.469 --> 17:14.494
Evil will crush you all.

17:18.276 --> 17:20.556
No, it cannot be!

17:20.580 --> 17:23.932
He... He is as powerful as I!

17:27.952 --> 17:29.146
Incredible.

17:29.888 --> 17:34.291
Your goodness is equal
to my own dark power.

17:34.426 --> 17:38.226
I could fight him for
years and never win.

17:38.396 --> 17:40.364
I'm ready if you are.

17:41.433 --> 17:44.402
I will waste no more time with you.

17:45.003 --> 17:47.938
I still claim Mallek as mine!

17:48.740 --> 17:49.434
No!

17:50.008 --> 17:52.738
You'll not take him. I say, no!

17:53.078 --> 17:55.342
I offer you another soul, Evil One.

17:55.480 --> 17:58.278
A soul freely given for Mallek's.

17:58.416 --> 17:59.781
My own.
-Karyn!

18:00.118 --> 18:03.315
Your soul? Unheard of.

18:03.555 --> 18:06.353
Never has there been such an offer.

18:06.524 --> 18:10.255
I love Mallek and would
risk anything for him,

18:10.462 --> 18:12.225
even oblivion itself.

18:12.397 --> 18:17.096
It is done then.
I release Mallek,

18:18.169 --> 18:21.400
with your soul... for his!

18:27.479 --> 18:28.639
My hand!

18:30.115 --> 18:31.980
Curse you girl!

18:32.183 --> 18:35.016
Any soul, that would give
itself up for another...

18:35.186 --> 18:39.179
must be filled with the
one power I can never over come...

18:39.757 --> 18:43.454
The one power that could destroy me...

18:46.064 --> 18:47.395
The power of love!

18:49.334 --> 18:50.801
Real love, this time.

18:55.707 --> 18:57.766
I have been cheated.

18:58.743 --> 19:01.576
Lokus!  Lokus!

19:02.447 --> 19:04.347
Curse you.

19:04.949 --> 19:08.214
This is all... all your fault.

19:08.553 --> 19:10.350
But... but... master.

19:13.191 --> 19:15.352
I will deal with you later.

19:15.793 --> 19:17.852
As for you, He-Man...

19:18.296 --> 19:20.093
our battle...

19:20.765 --> 19:24.166
our battle will continue.
-I'll be waiting.

19:42.187 --> 19:45.020
We make better friends than
enemies, Mallek.

19:45.190 --> 19:46.817
That we do, He-Man.

19:47.692 --> 19:49.223
We fixed the dam, Teela,

19:49.248 --> 19:51.152
but I don't know how to make up for...

19:51.329 --> 19:52.990
for all of the trouble I've caused you.

19:53.298 --> 19:55.249
Just give the attention you wanted to

19:55.274 --> 19:56.917
spend on me to someone who deserves it.

20:00.872 --> 20:04.035
I hope you don't take losing
Mallek too hard, Teela.

20:04.409 --> 20:07.071
Actually, there's someone
I've been working with...

20:07.245 --> 20:09.372
that I've grown rather fond of.

20:09.547 --> 20:11.242
Really? Anyone I know?

20:12.850 --> 20:14.374
Coming, Ram Man?

20:15.353 --> 20:16.877
Ram Man?
-Ram Man?

20:19.090 --> 20:20.387
Eh guys,

20:21.192 --> 20:22.716
when you got it,

20:23.461 --> 20:24.621
[chuckles] you got it!

20:29.901 --> 20:33.803
In today's adventure, Mallek thought
he could do whatever he wanted.

20:33.972 --> 20:37.203
But instead he found that
when you do something wrong,

20:37.375 --> 20:39.036
you may get away with it for a while,

20:39.210 --> 20:41.542
but sooner or later you
have to answer for it.

20:41.746 --> 20:44.544
Fortunately for him,
Mallek had friends who cared about him

20:44.749 --> 20:46.046
and came to his rescue.

20:46.150 --> 20:49.711
All of us make mistakes,
but doing something wrong,

20:49.921 --> 20:52.651
when you know it's wrong,
really doesn't make sense.

20:52.824 --> 20:55.520
Sooner or later it catches up to you.

20:55.693 --> 20:56.990
Until next time.... bye.
