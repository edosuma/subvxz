What?

02:09.658 --> 02:12.060
Why?

02:12.062 --> 02:14.160
You're giving me late notice
on this,

02:14.162 --> 02:16.479
but I'll try
to figure out something.

02:20.009 --> 02:21.519
Say it ain't so.

02:22.696 --> 02:24.275
It's so.

02:24.277 --> 02:26.391
But you've got a plan.

02:26.393 --> 02:28.408
Up and running.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.557
All right, if Sam clears
his throat any harder,

02:36.559 --> 02:38.019
he's gonna break a hip.

02:39.448 --> 02:42.119
Kensi.
Yeah?

02:42.121 --> 02:44.225
What are you doing
Saturday night?

02:44.227 --> 02:45.892
Uh...

02:45.894 --> 02:48.403
nothing. I mean...

02:49.652 --> 02:51.157
Why?

02:51.158 --> 02:53.295
G got tickets
to the Clippers game.

02:53.297 --> 02:54.639
My babysitter flaked out on me.

02:54.641 --> 02:56.987
His wife's out
of the country.

02:56.989 --> 02:58.559
You want me to babysit?

02:58.561 --> 02:59.936
Now that you mention it.

02:59.938 --> 03:02.009
That is a great idea.
Uh...

03:02.011 --> 03:03.579
We'll do it.

03:03.581 --> 03:04.956
What?
Yep.

03:04.958 --> 03:07.238
No, I want you at least 500 feet
away from my kids, minimal.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.518
What are you talking about?
I'm great with kids.

03:09.520 --> 03:12.441
Yeah. See, I'm not.
Kids and me-- we don't mix.

03:12.443 --> 03:13.911
Wait. What?

03:13.913 --> 03:16.445
Are you one of those people
that hates kids?

03:16.447 --> 03:18.472
Hate's a strong word.

03:18.474 --> 03:20.128
Well, you clearly
don't like them.

03:20.130 --> 03:22.072
No...
You hate my kids?

03:22.074 --> 03:24.014
Oh, gosh, Sam, no.

03:24.016 --> 03:25.569
Wow.
You hate my kids.

03:25.571 --> 03:27.428
No.
This...

03:27.430 --> 03:29.168
changes everything.

03:29.170 --> 03:31.314
What? What does it change?

03:35.032 --> 03:37.109
You're a hater.

03:37.111 --> 03:38.326
No, Sam...

03:38.327 --> 03:39.812
A <i>kid</i> hater.

03:40.979 --> 03:43.394
Wow.

03:44.713 --> 03:46.064
Uh...!

03:47.333 --> 03:49.250
Eric, I don't hate kids.

03:49.252 --> 03:50.618
Sure, you don't.

03:54.355 --> 03:56.123
This is Miguel Barbosa.

03:56.125 --> 03:59.176
He's the kingpin of the Barbosa
cartel in Tijuana, Mexico.

03:59.178 --> 04:01.744
Seems like every time we take
one of these guys down,

04:01.746 --> 04:03.214
another five grow
in their place.

04:03.216 --> 04:04.966
Each one worse
than the next.

04:04.968 --> 04:07.467
Barbosa was gunned down
in a high-noon shootout

04:07.469 --> 04:10.137
with local law enforcement
in Tijuana, Mexico.

04:10.139 --> 04:11.855
Wow, big catch.

04:11.857 --> 04:13.424
Well, they were backed
by Americans.

04:13.426 --> 04:14.809
Navy kept Barbosa's
reinforcements

04:14.811 --> 04:16.259
from arriving on the water,

04:16.261 --> 04:18.029
and DEA added firepower
on the ground.

04:18.031 --> 04:20.096
"But..."

04:20.099 --> 04:22.867
But Barbosa's corpse

04:22.869 --> 04:25.318
was stolen upon
arrival at the morgue.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.437
That's common with the cartels.

04:27.439 --> 04:29.239
Deprives law enforcement
of a trophy

04:29.241 --> 04:31.374
and allows them
to bury their own.

04:31.376 --> 04:33.776
The shooter knew
this corpse was coming in.

04:33.778 --> 04:36.414
How long was he waiting
in the container?

04:39.635 --> 04:41.192
There.

04:41.194 --> 04:43.030
Shooter got there two
hours before the body.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.752
He knew the gunfight
was gonna happen

04:44.754 --> 04:46.525
and Barbosa
was gonna get smoked.

04:46.527 --> 04:48.117
Sounds like our side
has a leak.

04:48.119 --> 04:49.150
SECNAV agrees.

04:49.152 --> 04:50.660
That's why he
assigned us the case.

04:50.662 --> 04:53.006
Find the leak,
track down Barbosa's body.

04:53.008 --> 04:54.843
Who ran this op
at the DEA?

04:54.845 --> 04:57.173
Uh, Agent John Ness.

04:57.175 --> 04:59.765
He's with the L.A. office.
Should be expecting us.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.259
And Tijuana police have
a high-value informant

05:02.261 --> 05:03.917
who's an expert
on the Barbosa cartel,

05:03.919 --> 05:06.131
but they'll only release
information on him in person

05:06.133 --> 05:07.313
and on their own turf.

05:07.314 --> 05:08.593
All right, we'll speak
with Ness.

05:08.595 --> 05:10.349
Why don't you guys head down
to Tijuana,

05:10.351 --> 05:12.942
see if this informant has
any idea where the body went?

05:12.944 --> 05:14.910
Well, Kensi should be fine,

05:14.912 --> 05:17.618
unless, of course,
the informant is a child.

05:17.620 --> 05:21.752
And yet I've managed to get
along with you this entire time.

05:21.754 --> 05:23.516
Touché.

05:27.265 --> 05:30.071
You guys have plans
this weekend?

05:32.172 --> 05:33.734
Yep.
Yep.

05:33.736 --> 05:35.414
Oh.

05:35.416 --> 05:37.599
Good-bye, Clippers game.

05:43.180 --> 05:45.648
Can I be of assistance,
gentlemen?

05:50.371 --> 05:52.504
Nope.
We're good.

06:01.698 --> 06:04.134
<i>File on Ness indicates</i>
<i>he's a serious guy.</i>

06:04.136 --> 06:05.831
<i>Practically lives</i>
<i>at the office.</i>

06:05.833 --> 06:07.494
Can't be bought.

06:07.496 --> 06:08.973
An old-school
gunslinger type.

06:08.975 --> 06:10.369
Yeah, I heard about him.

06:10.371 --> 06:11.712
He used to run
counter-narcotics ops

06:11.714 --> 06:14.183
back in the '90s,
Latin America.

06:14.185 --> 06:15.795
His call sign
was "Ahab""

06:15.797 --> 06:17.410
He's an obsessive guy.

06:25.409 --> 06:26.837
Agents Callen
and Hanna?

06:26.839 --> 06:29.811
That's us.
You Agent Ness?

06:29.813 --> 06:30.886
One and only.

06:30.889 --> 06:32.803
How you doing?
Good.

06:32.805 --> 06:34.349
How's it going?
Good.

06:34.351 --> 06:35.659
So, does SECNAV really think

06:35.661 --> 06:37.710
I got Barbosa stuffed
and mounted in my office?

06:37.712 --> 06:39.927
Not exactly.

06:39.929 --> 06:42.281
Because I think
it's a damn good idea.

06:42.283 --> 06:45.272
It's too bad the cartels got
their hands on him before I did.

06:45.274 --> 06:47.372
Let's go talk in here.

06:59.708 --> 07:01.553
We're not interrogating you,
Ness.

07:01.555 --> 07:02.916
Maybe I'm interrogating you.

07:02.918 --> 07:04.264
It doesn't have

07:04.266 --> 07:05.428
to be like this.

07:05.430 --> 07:07.623
If we're talking about
Miguel Barbosa, it does.

07:07.625 --> 07:10.200
Hope you don't mind
if I have a seat.

07:10.202 --> 07:12.661
I stay standing longer
than five minutes,

07:12.663 --> 07:15.056
my back goes into spasms.

07:18.982 --> 07:21.808
You chased him
for over ten years, huh?

07:21.810 --> 07:25.416
Ten years, three months,
21 days.

07:25.418 --> 07:28.244
Most of it in the field,
the rest of it behind a desk

07:28.246 --> 07:31.902
after Barbosa tried
to kill me and failed.

07:31.904 --> 07:34.596
He's recording this session, G.

07:34.598 --> 07:38.687
Look, Ness, the Navy's
not doubting you.

07:38.689 --> 07:41.099
In fact, we'd like your help.

07:41.101 --> 07:42.994
You know this case
isn't officially closed

07:42.996 --> 07:44.707
until we locate
Barbosa's body, right?

07:47.751 --> 07:50.246
My men were on site
when he was killed.

07:50.248 --> 07:53.854
I was following the op in
real time and received pictures

07:53.856 --> 07:55.633
of his dead face from the scene,

07:55.635 --> 07:57.629
which I confirmed.

07:59.892 --> 08:01.969
My keepsake.

08:01.971 --> 08:04.001
Does that give you closure?

08:04.003 --> 08:08.115
After the car bomb, I woke up in
a hospital bed in Mexico City.

08:08.117 --> 08:10.298
Told me I lost my leg.

08:11.798 --> 08:14.579
Then they told me about my wife.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.910
I called Miguel Barbosa
from my bed,

08:16.912 --> 08:21.208
and I told him,
"I will never stop coming.

08:21.210 --> 08:22.773
"Take my other leg.

08:22.775 --> 08:24.739
"Take everything I have, pal.

08:24.741 --> 08:27.987
But in the end,
I'm gonna get you."

08:29.455 --> 08:32.318
We'll keep in touch,
Agent Ness.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.601
You know where
to find me.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.565
Thank you.

08:53.975 --> 08:55.304
<i>Buenas noches, señorita.</i>

08:55.306 --> 08:57.354
Hey.
Huh?

08:57.356 --> 08:58.770
<i>Vámonos,</i> cowboy.

08:58.772 --> 08:59.889
God, I love Mexico.

08:59.891 --> 09:01.258
Seriously, this
place has got

09:01.260 --> 09:02.695
four of my
favorite things.

09:02.697 --> 09:05.067
It's got cheap beer,
it's got great surf,

09:05.069 --> 09:06.704
it's got, obviously,
beautiful women,

09:06.706 --> 09:09.326
it's got sombreros.

09:09.328 --> 09:11.280
Stay sexy.

09:22.238 --> 09:23.806
<i>No me gusta.</i>

09:23.808 --> 09:25.577
So, how are we supposed

09:25.579 --> 09:27.950
to recognize this, uh,
police contact of ours?

09:27.952 --> 09:29.486
His department
didn't give us his name

09:29.489 --> 09:31.490
or the name of his
high-value informant.

09:31.492 --> 09:33.828
S.O.P. in cartel country.
Thanks.

09:33.830 --> 09:37.354
But he knows what we look like.
Wow, that is fantastic.

09:40.444 --> 09:42.030
Kid's not so bad.

09:42.032 --> 09:44.619
There's that word
again-- "kid""

09:44.621 --> 09:46.335
Deeks...
You really don't like them?

09:46.337 --> 09:49.269
I didn't exactly have
the ideal upbringing.

09:49.271 --> 09:51.594
Maybe I don't want to put a kid
through that, too.

09:51.596 --> 09:53.022
Okay, you really
want to do this?

09:53.024 --> 09:55.555
You want to have the
crappy-childhood contest with me?

09:56.566 --> 09:59.565
You and I get to see
how dark this world is getting

09:59.567 --> 10:00.815
on a daily basis.

10:00.817 --> 10:03.140
Why would I want
to bring a child into that?

10:03.142 --> 10:05.706
Fair enough, but, you know,
this isn't to be shocking,

10:05.708 --> 10:07.775
but you don't have
to do it alone.

10:07.777 --> 10:09.346
I mean, it takes
two people.

10:09.348 --> 10:11.480
And if you didn't know that,
I could demonstrate for you.

10:11.481 --> 10:14.510
I just need, like,
a cape, some tequila.

10:14.512 --> 10:16.113
Agent Blye,
Detective Deeks?

10:16.115 --> 10:18.327
Sanchez, Tijuana PD.

10:18.329 --> 10:19.978
Sanchez...

10:19.980 --> 10:22.303
how do you feel about children?

10:23.379 --> 10:25.864
Cops don't banter down here.
All right.

10:25.866 --> 10:27.819
Barbosa may be dead,
but we're still living

10:27.821 --> 10:28.799
in a war zone.

10:28.801 --> 10:29.921
Where's your informant?

10:35.326 --> 10:37.009
The kid?
His name is Javier.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.403
My team...

10:39.688 --> 10:40.745
I'll get him.
Move!

10:40.746 --> 10:42.091
Moving!

10:42.093 --> 10:43.583
Hey!

10:44.595 --> 10:46.261
Get down!

10:51.200 --> 10:52.354
Exfil out the back door!

10:52.356 --> 10:54.167
You got to get better groupies.

11:19.819 --> 11:21.753
If I'd known this is what it
took to get across the border,

11:21.754 --> 11:24.125
I would have tried getting shot
a long time ago.

11:24.127 --> 11:26.564
Relax, man, relax.

11:26.566 --> 11:27.876
What's your name, amigo?

11:27.878 --> 11:30.213
Javier.

11:30.215 --> 11:33.375
And I probably speak
better English than you, amigo.

11:33.377 --> 11:36.067
No argument there.

11:37.328 --> 11:38.926
I want a lawyer.

11:38.928 --> 11:41.701
Yeah, might be one back at the
cantina with those shooters.

11:41.703 --> 11:43.635
We can always dump you
back there, Javier.

11:43.637 --> 11:45.401
Listen, we're on
your side, desperado.

11:45.404 --> 11:46.528
Then why can't
I have a lawyer?

11:46.530 --> 11:47.786
Because I said so.

11:47.788 --> 11:49.838
Did you just drop the

11:49.840 --> 11:51.295
"because I said so" bomb on him?

11:51.297 --> 11:53.993
So, what if I did?
What do you mean, "What if I did?"

11:53.995 --> 11:55.268
What, are you gonna
send him to his room next?

11:55.270 --> 11:57.089
Excuse me?
Take away his milk money?

11:57.091 --> 11:58.413
Whoa...
Why are you guys arguing?

11:58.415 --> 11:59.952
We're not arguing.
We're not arguing.

11:59.954 --> 12:01.260
We are having
a discussion.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.882
Why don't you just work
on that ten and two?

12:02.884 --> 12:04.586
Oh, what?

12:04.588 --> 12:06.523
Ten and two, ten and two.
Yeah?

12:06.525 --> 12:09.552
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Put your hands on the wheel.

12:15.793 --> 12:17.977
Lady's crazy, dude.

12:19.104 --> 12:21.288
Kind of reminds me of my mom.

12:22.464 --> 12:24.201
Listen, I know this
is hard to believe,

12:24.203 --> 12:25.890
but I guarantee
you're safer with us

12:25.892 --> 12:27.412
than you are anyplace else.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.895
I never committed a crime.

12:29.897 --> 12:31.517
I never hurt anyone, I swear.

12:31.519 --> 12:33.751
So why'd those guys
come after you?

12:40.986 --> 12:42.975
Okay. Thank you.

12:42.977 --> 12:45.369
NSA says there's been no
Barbosa-related chatter.

12:45.371 --> 12:46.734
Everyone's laying low.

12:46.736 --> 12:49.095
Could mean something big's
going down.

12:49.097 --> 12:51.202
Same with the Mexican Federales.

12:51.204 --> 12:54.271
If somebody knows about the hit,
nobody's talking.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.260
Hey.

12:56.262 --> 12:57.894
What did you guys pick up
on the singer?

12:57.897 --> 13:00.474
His name is
Javier Ramos.

13:00.476 --> 13:02.077
And he's not just a singer.

13:02.079 --> 13:03.576
He's a cartel celebrity.

13:03.578 --> 13:05.280
A <i>narcocorrida.</i>

13:05.282 --> 13:07.286
Minstrels for the drug cartel.

13:07.288 --> 13:10.372
They make music that glorifies
criminals like Barbosa.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.563
Like folk singers
for the Mexican underworld.

13:12.565 --> 13:15.935
Javier was Barbosa's personal
songwriter and performer.

13:15.937 --> 13:18.345
So who stands to gain
by killing Javier?

13:18.347 --> 13:19.930
Well, this cartel
had some problems.

13:19.932 --> 13:22.341
Barbosa's right-hand man
wanted to take over.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.977
Pedro Moreno.

13:23.979 --> 13:25.731
Their men were taking sides.

13:25.733 --> 13:27.198
It was going to be civil war,

13:27.200 --> 13:29.541
but Barbosa was killed
before it could start.

13:29.543 --> 13:31.615
Civil war would have been ugly.

13:31.617 --> 13:33.756
May have been some
Barbosa loyalists left,

13:33.758 --> 13:35.577
Javier's songs glorified him.

13:35.579 --> 13:39.033
Those people in Mexico take
their narco music seriously.

13:39.035 --> 13:42.069
Maybe seriously enough
to turn Barbosa into a martyr.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.092
Moreno killing Javier
would be the final nail

13:44.094 --> 13:46.083
in Barbosa's coffin.

13:46.085 --> 13:48.240
End his legacy forever.

13:50.098 --> 13:51.475
You guys, go home.

13:51.477 --> 13:53.250
Get some sleep.

13:53.252 --> 13:55.374
All right. Good night.
Thanks. Night.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.784
Good night.

13:58.693 --> 14:00.517
I don't know.

14:00.519 --> 14:02.259
What do you think?

14:04.830 --> 14:08.015
I think we need
to talk to Ahab again.

14:09.642 --> 14:11.798
This has been
a memorable adventure.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.589
Are we almost there yet?

14:13.591 --> 14:16.194
He asked you that
like ten minutes ago.

14:16.196 --> 14:17.439
Yeah, welcome to my life.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.396
Maybe we can just pull over
for like a half a second.

14:19.398 --> 14:21.171
I think I saw a cactus
with my name on it.

14:21.173 --> 14:22.217
Seriously,
Deeks, again?

14:22.219 --> 14:23.775
Unless you want me
to pee in a bottle...

14:23.777 --> 14:25.037
again.

14:25.039 --> 14:26.198
All right.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.724
Hey. Damn it.
Enjoy.

14:27.726 --> 14:30.144
Look, I...

14:30.146 --> 14:32.430
I don't know why
those guys wanted to kill me.

14:32.432 --> 14:34.065
Honest.

14:34.067 --> 14:35.233
They didn't want to kill you.

14:35.235 --> 14:36.702
If they wanted to,
you'd be dead.

14:36.704 --> 14:38.270
Okay?

14:38.272 --> 14:39.873
They shot
Detective Sanchez first.

14:39.875 --> 14:42.159
And then they took shots at me
and then my partner.

14:42.161 --> 14:44.879
Never you--
they wanted you alive.

14:44.881 --> 14:47.081
She's right-- somebody
wants an audience

14:47.083 --> 14:49.618
with you pretty bad, and
I don't think it's to sing

14:49.620 --> 14:51.787
"Hava Nagila" at their
kid's Bar Mitzvah.

14:51.789 --> 14:53.640
I'm not a snitch.

14:53.642 --> 14:57.061
Okay. Fine.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.629
Don't say anything.

15:04.855 --> 15:07.857
I was Miguel Barbosa's
best friend.

15:18.421 --> 15:19.922
Here he is.

15:19.924 --> 15:22.342
You guys mind
making some room?

15:22.344 --> 15:23.960
Sure.
Thanks.

15:23.962 --> 15:25.495
How's it going?

15:25.497 --> 15:26.663
You boys hungry?

15:26.665 --> 15:28.164
Kitchen makes a mean
mac and cheese.

15:29.335 --> 15:30.635
We're good, thanks.
Sean.

15:30.637 --> 15:32.187
Give me two orders
of mac and cheese

15:32.189 --> 15:34.273
for my sailor friends here.

15:34.275 --> 15:35.808
An attempt was made
on Javier Ramos's life

15:35.810 --> 15:37.477
last night in Tijuana.

15:37.479 --> 15:40.396
Dance with the devil, you're
gonna smell like brimstone.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.648
Javier was a cartel groupie--
his songs make kids want

15:42.650 --> 15:44.813
to grow up
with gold-plated A.K.'s.

15:44.815 --> 15:48.847
Pedro Moreno was part
of Barbosa's entourage, too.

15:48.849 --> 15:50.846
They were about
to go to war.

15:50.848 --> 15:52.898
Any reason you could
think of that Moreno

15:52.900 --> 15:55.731
would want Javier to join
Barbosa in the afterlife?

15:59.348 --> 16:00.531
You first, Sam.

16:00.533 --> 16:02.282
You're crazy.

16:02.284 --> 16:04.231
There's no way I'm putting
this garbage in my body.

16:04.233 --> 16:07.030
Come on, eat up while I think.
I'm actually allergic to dairy.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.014
Oh, since when?

16:08.016 --> 16:10.481
Since... that thing.

16:10.483 --> 16:11.649
What thing?
That thing.

16:11.651 --> 16:12.699
Allergic.

16:12.701 --> 16:14.515
I have to pass.

16:14.517 --> 16:15.698
I'm gluten-free.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.981
What the hell's gluten?

16:17.983 --> 16:19.514
I'm pretty sure there's
nothing gluten in there.

16:19.516 --> 16:21.681
To answer your question,

16:21.683 --> 16:22.982
Barbosa was a megalomaniac.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.681
Which means the only
reason Moreno would

16:24.683 --> 16:27.065
even go after Javier
would be to...

16:31.366 --> 16:32.649
Ness?

16:32.651 --> 16:34.092
Ness.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.617
Agent Ness.

16:37.302 --> 16:39.900
Get a medic.

16:40.655 --> 16:41.986
Agent Ness!

16:41.988 --> 16:43.719
I don't think this is
a heart attack, G.

16:43.721 --> 16:45.836
Secure every exit--
no one leaves this building.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.361
Yes, sir.

16:53.169 --> 16:54.629
He's dead.

17:18.657 --> 17:20.133
What do you got?

17:20.135 --> 17:22.378
Kitchen staff reported
one missing cook's uniform.

17:22.381 --> 17:25.137
Security cams didn't catch
any unauthorized visitors

17:25.140 --> 17:26.374
coming or going.

17:26.376 --> 17:27.593
Killer's a pro.

17:27.595 --> 17:29.438
Yeah, forensics team
says he was killed

17:29.440 --> 17:31.283
by an aconitine toxin.

17:31.285 --> 17:32.887
Yeah, monkshood plant.

17:32.889 --> 17:35.535
Guns and knives in a federal
building get assassins caught.

17:35.537 --> 17:36.980
Vegetation...

17:36.981 --> 17:38.631
not so much.
Mm-hmm.

17:38.633 --> 17:40.107
Well, with Ness
dead, we only have

17:40.109 --> 17:41.921
one reliable
Barbosa source left.

17:41.923 --> 17:44.327
Any chance of finding the
leak or the stolen body,

17:44.329 --> 17:46.124
it's gonna come
down to one guy.

17:46.126 --> 17:48.851
<i>Narcocorrida.</i>

17:48.853 --> 17:51.883
Javier.

17:58.201 --> 18:01.030
Ever heard of
DEA Agent John Ness?

18:02.362 --> 18:03.541
Sure.

18:03.543 --> 18:06.118
He's Barbosa's worst nightmare.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.634
He has this obsession
with catching him.

18:07.636 --> 18:09.201
Had an obsession.

18:09.203 --> 18:11.458
Ness was killed inside
his own office building

18:11.460 --> 18:13.008
less than a half hour ago.

18:13.010 --> 18:14.658
Poisoned, killer escaped.

18:16.698 --> 18:19.206
Ness is an expert on Barbosa.

18:19.208 --> 18:21.869
I mean, that's kind of
like you, right?

18:21.871 --> 18:24.647
You don't think your
cantina adventure

18:24.649 --> 18:26.332
and the Ness hit
were connected?

18:26.334 --> 18:28.236
I-I don't know.

18:28.238 --> 18:30.123
Someone's tying up
Barbosa's loose ends.

18:30.125 --> 18:32.346
You're the last one left.

18:32.348 --> 18:34.705
We just need a name, desperado.

18:38.682 --> 18:41.442
Okay, you want to talk
about Barbosa's enemies

18:41.444 --> 18:43.599
inside the cartel--
what about Pedro Moreno?

18:43.601 --> 18:45.755
Moreno?

18:45.757 --> 18:48.198
He's just a psycho.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.603
Barbosa was more than that.

18:50.605 --> 18:54.201
I was singing for pesos
on the street when he found me.

18:54.203 --> 18:58.065
Took me in, bought me
a new guitar that same day.

18:58.066 --> 19:01.946
He wanted me to sing
"Happy Birthday" to his mother.

19:01.948 --> 19:04.433
He even let me keep
that guitar afterwards.

19:04.435 --> 19:06.804
So, he discovered you?

19:08.911 --> 19:11.697
Nobody ever gave me
anything before.

19:11.699 --> 19:14.649
My dad was killed
in a cartel crossfire

19:14.651 --> 19:15.843
when I was
a little boy.

19:15.845 --> 19:18.081
Barbosa took me in.

19:18.083 --> 19:19.990
And you paid him back
by singing <i>narcocorridas</i>

19:19.992 --> 19:22.642
that would make him
a living legend in Mexico.

19:23.770 --> 19:25.793
We'd talk about music for hours.

19:25.795 --> 19:27.950
His ideas for lyrics.

19:27.952 --> 19:31.763
The things Barbosa had seen and
done on his rise to the throne.

19:34.716 --> 19:37.269
I heard his hopes,

19:37.271 --> 19:40.387
his dreams, his fears.

19:41.249 --> 19:43.405
And you got another father.

19:59.891 --> 20:02.659
I lost my father, too.

20:05.396 --> 20:07.965
He was an amazing man.

20:10.621 --> 20:12.858
My dad wasn't an amazing man.

20:12.860 --> 20:16.175
He was actually kind of
a terrible human being.

20:16.177 --> 20:19.160
But that didn't mean
that I didn't miss him

20:19.162 --> 20:23.173
in some weird way
after he was gone.

20:23.175 --> 20:25.693
And I think my point is that I
understand what it's like

20:25.695 --> 20:28.562
to have conflicted emotions
about your father.

20:31.382 --> 20:34.522
Barbosa was a monster
to most people.

20:36.554 --> 20:40.567
Nobody can ever replace
a father, but he was who I had.

20:43.020 --> 20:44.614
It feels like you're
the first people

20:44.616 --> 20:47.971
I've ever met who get that.

20:51.617 --> 20:53.664
It sounds like Kensi
and Deeks are making

20:53.666 --> 20:54.689
some progress on Javier.

20:54.691 --> 20:56.855
Let's go.

20:56.857 --> 20:59.139
Not so fast, gentlemen.

20:59.141 --> 21:01.187
Here to put out
fires, Hetty?

21:01.189 --> 21:03.252
Put out fires?

21:03.254 --> 21:05.183
This is an inferno

21:05.185 --> 21:08.273
to make Dante Alighieri blush.

21:08.275 --> 21:10.086
How bad's the fallout?

21:10.088 --> 21:12.470
Bad, very bad.

21:12.472 --> 21:15.797
As a matter of fact,
SECNAV and the DEA director

21:15.799 --> 21:20.128
want to hear your after-action
report on Ness's murder.

21:20.130 --> 21:21.673
SECNAV needs to know
that we don't have

21:21.675 --> 21:23.101
that kind of time right now.

21:23.103 --> 21:25.585
Well, you can tell him
yourself, Mr. Hanna.

21:25.587 --> 21:27.264
He's upstairs

21:27.266 --> 21:28.255
right now.

21:28.257 --> 21:29.700
SECNAV is on site?

21:29.702 --> 21:31.966
On site and unhappy.

21:31.968 --> 21:33.628
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

21:33.630 --> 21:35.392
Ms. Blye and Mr. Deeks

21:35.394 --> 21:37.022
will just have to wait for you.

21:37.024 --> 21:39.691
That's okay. I-I'll go upstairs
and debrief them.

21:39.693 --> 21:41.173
Go to the boatshed.
I'll catch up.

21:41.175 --> 21:42.541
I'm not gonna send you
to the lions alone.

21:42.543 --> 21:44.385
I work with Granger
on a daily basis.

21:44.387 --> 21:46.691
Lions are just another day
at the office.

21:46.693 --> 21:49.739
Go, Mr. Callen,
before the inferno grows.

21:49.741 --> 21:51.881
I'm good.

21:51.883 --> 21:54.070
All right.

21:56.790 --> 21:58.304
What was the last thing

21:58.306 --> 21:59.918
you remember discussing
with Barbosa?

21:59.920 --> 22:01.632
Anything can help us,
Javier.

22:04.696 --> 22:08.567
Lately he was obsessed
with the idea of immortality.

22:08.569 --> 22:10.362
Living forever?

22:10.364 --> 22:12.717
No.

22:12.719 --> 22:14.942
Being raised from the dead.

22:15.931 --> 22:17.445
Resurrection.

22:18.980 --> 22:20.592
He'd sip tequila
and smoke cigars

22:20.594 --> 22:22.157
out on his deck.

22:22.159 --> 22:24.989
Talk all night about
the Savior's second coming.

22:26.886 --> 22:28.663
Was Barbosa a religious man?

22:28.665 --> 22:30.623
No.

22:30.624 --> 22:33.328
He just liked the drama of it.

22:33.330 --> 22:36.417
See, his enemies
would think they killed him

22:36.419 --> 22:38.398
and sleep soundly that night.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.780
And come morning,
all the world would know

22:40.782 --> 22:43.066
that Miguel Barbosa
rose from the grave

22:43.068 --> 22:44.788
and brought hell along with him.

22:44.790 --> 22:46.687
Sounds like a song.

22:46.689 --> 22:48.006
It was.

22:48.830 --> 22:51.034
I called it "Resurrection."

22:52.645 --> 22:54.864
When Barbosa heard it,
he told me

22:54.866 --> 22:57.842
never play it for anybody else,
ever again.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.887
And why do you think
he said that?

23:03.235 --> 23:05.681
He was a great guy.

23:05.683 --> 23:07.532
A little crazy, but...

23:07.534 --> 23:10.269
he said it would ruin
the surprise

23:10.271 --> 23:13.730
when he really did come back
from the dead.

23:21.005 --> 23:23.097
We'll be back.

23:27.059 --> 23:29.536
You thinking what
we're thinking?

23:30.552 --> 23:33.077
Barbosa's alive.

23:47.918 --> 23:49.270
You done with
the debriefing?

23:49.271 --> 23:50.401
Just getting started.

23:50.402 --> 23:52.912
They gave me a break
before we get back into it.

23:52.914 --> 23:55.229
Ness was in line for assistant
directorship at the DEA.

23:55.231 --> 23:57.332
They want to know
every detail about his death.

23:57.334 --> 23:59.749
Callen, Federales sent us photos
of the Barbosa shoot-out.

23:59.773 --> 24:01.204
Throw it up.

24:01.205 --> 24:04.840
We think Barbosa
may have staged his own death.

24:04.842 --> 24:06.393
Now, Ness verified
these photos,

24:06.395 --> 24:08.243
but he's been emotionally
involved in the case

24:08.245 --> 24:09.595
for over
ten years.

24:09.597 --> 24:11.130
He could've
gotten too close.

24:11.132 --> 24:13.883
Maybe he wanted Barbosa
dead so bad he got tricked.

24:13.885 --> 24:16.936
Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein
used look-alikes as decoys.

24:16.938 --> 24:19.189
It's not like
he doesn't have the resources.

24:19.191 --> 24:21.725
Barbosa has a lot of money
and a lot less overhead.

24:21.727 --> 24:23.693
He had a
limited window of time.

24:23.695 --> 24:26.062
Once officials ran the DNA
and the prints on this body,

24:26.064 --> 24:27.698
they'd realize
it wasn't the real deal.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.533
So they steal the body
from the morgue.

24:29.534 --> 24:31.702
It's gotten to be so routine
with the cartels

24:31.704 --> 24:33.704
that no one thinks
twice about it.

24:33.706 --> 24:35.844
Why don't you reach out
to the DEA and the CIA.

24:35.846 --> 24:37.688
Have them keep a close eye
for any communications

24:37.690 --> 24:38.642
to Barbosa's family

24:38.644 --> 24:40.733
or his top lieutenants.
Okay.

24:40.735 --> 24:42.172
I got to get back.
Keep me in the loop.

24:42.197 --> 24:43.614
I will.

24:43.615 --> 24:45.506
You are sorely missed.

24:45.508 --> 24:48.223
I could always...
Keep walking, Mr. Hanna.

24:50.743 --> 24:52.140
Barbosa's alive, Hetty.

24:52.142 --> 24:54.313
This whole ruse
makes total sense.

24:54.315 --> 24:56.337
In a cartel power struggle,

24:56.339 --> 25:00.404
the smartest move
would be for all his enemies

25:00.406 --> 25:02.543
to assume that he's deceased.

25:02.545 --> 25:04.567
And it gives him
the element of surprise

25:04.569 --> 25:05.671
to move against Moreno.

25:05.673 --> 25:06.740
Unfortunately,

25:06.742 --> 25:07.975
Moreno's not the only one

25:07.977 --> 25:10.576
Barbosa hoped
would let down his guard.

25:10.578 --> 25:11.638
Ness.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.847
These guys are as brutal

25:13.849 --> 25:16.089
as the Chechens or
the Serbians ever were.

25:16.091 --> 25:17.965
I'm afraid
it's more than brutality

25:17.967 --> 25:20.124
we have to be concerned with.

25:20.126 --> 25:23.893
Mr. Barbosa has gone
to extraordinary lengths

25:23.895 --> 25:27.496
to lay out the board
to his advantage.

25:27.498 --> 25:32.229
Our next move has to be made
with extreme care.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.736
We'll find him.
We must.

25:34.738 --> 25:38.722
Otherwise, Agent Ness
will have died for nothing.

25:43.372 --> 25:46.509
The joke that Barbosa made
to you about resurrection...

25:46.511 --> 25:48.303
We don't think
that was a joke.

25:49.333 --> 25:50.827
You think it was Barbosa

25:50.829 --> 25:52.837
that sent someone
after me in the cantina?

25:52.839 --> 25:54.414
Well, we don't
know that for sure.

25:54.416 --> 25:55.825
Could've been Moreno.

25:58.234 --> 26:00.624
If Barbosa's alive...

26:00.626 --> 26:02.750
he'll know I'm here.

26:02.752 --> 26:05.107
I can't go back to <i>México.</i>

26:05.109 --> 26:06.618
Even here, I'm...

26:06.620 --> 26:08.445
We can put you
in a WITSEC program.

26:08.447 --> 26:10.255
That's short for...

26:10.257 --> 26:12.082
Witness Protection.

26:12.084 --> 26:14.092
There's satellites in <i>México.</i>

26:14.094 --> 26:15.403
I've seen the shows.

26:15.405 --> 26:17.662
You'd live under a new name,

26:17.664 --> 26:19.164
a new identity.

26:19.166 --> 26:21.668
It'll be a new start.

26:21.670 --> 26:25.523
But you can never contact
your friends and family again.

26:26.426 --> 26:28.461
So I guess that rules out
a record deal.

26:30.549 --> 26:34.471
Look, this isn't as simple as me
giving up my lifelong dream

26:34.473 --> 26:37.059
for guaranteed safety.
There are no guarantees.

26:37.061 --> 26:38.560
Barbosa has people everywhere.

26:38.563 --> 26:39.945
And in everything.

26:39.947 --> 26:41.431
You're
absolutely right.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.101
There have been cases

26:43.103 --> 26:44.552
where the program
was compromised.

26:47.625 --> 26:50.612
There is
another option.

26:50.614 --> 26:53.500
Help us go after him.

26:53.502 --> 26:55.671
If we get Barbosa,
he'll be placed in Supermax:

26:55.673 --> 26:59.008
the highest level security
prison in the country.

26:59.010 --> 27:00.978
Even the top criminals
and terrorists in the world

27:00.980 --> 27:03.297
are pretty much powerless
once they're inside.

27:05.653 --> 27:08.941
So, that would be the end of it?

27:09.976 --> 27:12.980
We're not gonna lie
to you, Javier.

27:12.982 --> 27:15.133
We all know there
are no guarantees

27:15.135 --> 27:16.652
with cartels.

27:16.654 --> 27:17.915
But...

27:17.917 --> 27:20.693
I like your odds
a whole lot better.

27:20.695 --> 27:24.351
And obviously going after
Barbosa's gonna be risky.

27:24.353 --> 27:27.228
And we're gonna have to
put you in harm's way.

27:27.230 --> 27:29.505
But you will never
leave our sight.

27:32.666 --> 27:34.660
I'll tell you what,
why don't we give you,

27:34.662 --> 27:36.937
uh, some time to
think about it.

27:59.385 --> 28:02.560
I don't like this, Mr. Callen.
I don't like it one bit.

28:02.562 --> 28:03.675
Hetty...

28:03.677 --> 28:05.005
Trying to lure
out Barbosa

28:05.007 --> 28:08.529
not only puts
Javier's life in danger,

28:08.531 --> 28:10.243
but also Ms. Blye

28:10.245 --> 28:12.620
and Mr. Deeks.
If Javier agrees to do it--

28:12.622 --> 28:14.516
and there's no guarantee
that he will--

28:14.518 --> 28:18.107
this is our only chance
at bringing down Barbosa.

28:18.109 --> 28:21.998
Bringing down Barbosa won't shut
down the cartel's operation.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.673
It just makes it easier
for his rivals to take control.

28:25.675 --> 28:28.166
And then it's back
to business as usual.

28:28.168 --> 28:31.942
Exactly. You just made
my point for me, Mr. Callen.

28:32.973 --> 28:34.326
Right.

28:34.328 --> 28:36.617
But... consider this, Hetty:

28:36.619 --> 28:39.158
You could have said
the same thing about the Mafia

28:39.160 --> 28:41.099
in New York City in the '80s.

28:41.101 --> 28:44.694
But it took more than ten years
of RICO indictments

28:44.696 --> 28:47.454
and much blood spilled
on both sides.

28:47.456 --> 28:48.908
And look at New York today.

28:48.910 --> 28:52.136
The Mob no longer
has a stranglehold on the city.

28:52.138 --> 28:54.895
Hetty, we have to keep at it.

28:54.897 --> 28:58.556
People deserve the right
to see their spouses off to work

28:58.558 --> 29:00.447
and their children off to school
without worrying

29:00.449 --> 29:02.905
about them coming home
in a body bag.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.438
It's probably the most
important decision of his life.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.211
Yeah, we're gonna do
everything we can

29:15.213 --> 29:17.971
to make sure he stays safe
no matter what he chooses.

29:17.973 --> 29:19.560
We can't hold
ourselves responsible

29:19.562 --> 29:21.900
for the consequences
of his decision.

29:21.902 --> 29:23.573
Really?

29:23.575 --> 29:25.311
What? It is his decision.

29:25.313 --> 29:27.033
It's not like we
weren't honest with him.

29:27.035 --> 29:28.121
He's not a kid.

29:28.123 --> 29:30.378
Oh, please.
I shudder at the thought

29:30.380 --> 29:32.501
of your decision-making skills
when you were that age.

29:32.503 --> 29:33.723
I'll have you know

29:33.725 --> 29:35.947
I was actually very mature for my age.
Mh-hmm.

29:35.949 --> 29:37.987
Probably as mature as a
drunken 20-something-year-old

29:37.989 --> 29:39.525
in a <i>Girls Gone Wild</i> video.

29:39.527 --> 29:42.367
Wow. Do you know those
based on vicarious viewings

29:42.369 --> 29:44.056
or is it something
much more first-hand?

29:44.058 --> 29:45.976
Touché. Bad example.

29:45.978 --> 29:48.316
'Cause I got my credit card
ready and the pause button...

29:48.318 --> 29:49.769
Hey, moving on.

29:52.109 --> 29:55.166
That's not much of a decision,
if you ask me.

29:55.168 --> 29:58.089
What do you mean?

29:58.091 --> 30:00.244
Going into WITSEC
with Barbosa still at large?

30:00.246 --> 30:02.851
Most WITSEC cases
go without incident.

30:02.853 --> 30:05.140
Yeah, but those odds go way down
when you're talking about

30:05.142 --> 30:06.977
Mexican drug cartel snitches.

30:06.979 --> 30:09.432
Okay, and what are his
odds if we dangle him

30:09.434 --> 30:12.206
like a worm on a hook
in front of a barracuda?

30:12.208 --> 30:14.444
Yeah, I guess
they both kind of suck.

30:14.446 --> 30:17.168
Yeah, they both kind of do.

30:23.568 --> 30:25.655
You think we
pushed him too hard?

30:28.078 --> 30:30.500
Maybe.

30:52.888 --> 30:54.175
Guys.

30:54.177 --> 30:56.046
What do you got, Eric?

30:56.047 --> 30:59.102
Word got out on the street that
Javier's being taken to WITSEC.

31:04.115 --> 31:06.704
You got that sweet
silver Range Rover?

31:07.757 --> 31:09.762
Keeping back nicely.

31:09.764 --> 31:12.051
Yeah, but he's been with us
for the last three

31:12.053 --> 31:13.638
random turns
that you've made.

31:13.640 --> 31:17.063
I told you
he's got people everywhere.

31:17.065 --> 31:19.601
Turn here.

31:26.803 --> 31:29.292
Good timing, Deeks.

31:43.677 --> 31:45.263
I make a point

31:45.265 --> 31:48.671
of wearing my gold Rolex
to my garbage man job.

31:55.206 --> 31:57.659
Get down!

32:04.712 --> 32:06.643
Kens!

32:11.394 --> 32:13.439
Stay down!

32:16.060 --> 32:17.992
Get down. Javier!

32:17.994 --> 32:20.236
Javier!
Javier!

32:32.225 --> 32:34.155
Damn it!

32:34.157 --> 32:35.466
Deeks!

32:36.694 --> 32:38.742
He's gone!

32:54.283 --> 32:56.491
♪

33:02.826 --> 33:04.955
<i>Fuera.</i>

33:25.643 --> 33:27.819
Javier!

33:31.587 --> 33:34.157
Hello, Mr. Barbosa.

33:34.159 --> 33:37.858
It seems rumors of your death
have been greatly exaggerated.

33:37.860 --> 33:38.906
Looks like the undercover op

33:38.908 --> 33:41.084
with the garbage truck
was a success.

33:41.086 --> 33:43.705
Let's not pat ourselves
on the back just yet, Ms. Jones.

33:43.707 --> 33:47.045
Mr. Barbosa may be alive,
but I'm afraid Javier

33:47.047 --> 33:49.306
may not be for very much longer.

33:53.811 --> 33:57.461
Okay, Javier's GPS has them
at 9th and Grand.

33:57.463 --> 33:59.492
Kensi and Deeks
are both in position.

34:00.329 --> 34:01.948
Eric, we got one security camera

34:01.950 --> 34:04.831
facing the parking lot
and one guy at the door.

34:04.833 --> 34:07.042
We're heading to the fire escape.
You ready? Go.

34:16.786 --> 34:19.242
Show us how good you've gotten.

34:19.244 --> 34:22.353
Maybe I can start singing
that resurrection ballad now.

34:25.793 --> 34:28.987
Your humor
translates well.

34:28.989 --> 34:31.556
Tell me, who was it
that got you?

34:31.559 --> 34:33.070
FBI?

34:33.072 --> 34:35.458
Homeland Security?

34:36.855 --> 34:39.359
NCIS-- U.S. Navy.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.342
But I didn't say
anything to them.

34:41.344 --> 34:42.705
No?
No.

34:42.706 --> 34:44.638
I'm sure you said something.

34:44.639 --> 34:46.404
"Hello."

34:46.406 --> 34:48.069
"Where's the bathroom?"

34:48.071 --> 34:50.893
"Can I get a coffee?"

34:50.895 --> 34:53.449
Well, yeah, yeah,
maybe a little bit, but I-I...

34:53.451 --> 34:54.761
Stop babbling.

35:00.865 --> 35:02.865
Do they know I'm alive?

35:02.867 --> 35:04.899
No.

35:04.901 --> 35:07.337
I didn't know you were alive.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.186
How could I tell them?

35:09.188 --> 35:10.985
Did I imply
that you did?

35:12.047 --> 35:15.576
Would you tell them,
had you known?

35:16.367 --> 35:18.333
No.

35:21.631 --> 35:25.244
It's not that I don't
believe you, Javier.

35:25.246 --> 35:29.615
It's just that sometimes,
when people talk,

35:29.617 --> 35:33.147
maybe you say something
you don't mean to.

35:33.149 --> 35:36.997
With all the questions
and the pressure,

35:36.999 --> 35:41.217
sometimes maybe a little
something slips out.

35:42.681 --> 35:45.253
Maybe you don't
realize it at the time

35:45.255 --> 35:49.372
or you forget
because of all the, uh...

35:49.374 --> 35:51.844
Confusion?

35:52.971 --> 35:55.291
Confusion.

35:55.293 --> 35:56.826
No.

35:56.828 --> 35:58.630
No, I-I swear.

35:58.632 --> 36:00.266
I didn't say anything.

36:02.386 --> 36:04.605
It's okay.

36:06.109 --> 36:08.779
It's okay. It's okay.

36:17.077 --> 36:19.078
It's okay.

36:20.498 --> 36:21.832
No. Miguel!

36:21.834 --> 36:23.051
Miguel, we're friends!

36:23.053 --> 36:24.536
We're... we're friends.

36:26.841 --> 36:31.381
You are closer to me
than anyone, Javier.

36:31.383 --> 36:34.853
That's more than a man
like me can afford.

36:36.691 --> 36:37.741
No.

36:37.743 --> 36:38.943
No!

36:42.583 --> 36:44.401
Mr. Beale?

36:44.403 --> 36:46.255
A few technical
difficulties.

36:46.257 --> 36:49.926
Well, I suggest
you fix them now.

37:00.428 --> 37:02.430
Barbosa...

37:02.432 --> 37:04.367
I survived.

37:04.369 --> 37:06.153
Ness?

37:06.155 --> 37:07.538
I'm never going to stop coming.

37:07.540 --> 37:09.508
You could take my other leg.

37:09.510 --> 37:12.329
You could take
everything I got, pal.

37:12.331 --> 37:13.799
But in the end,

37:13.801 --> 37:15.417
I'm going to get you.

37:15.419 --> 37:16.970
You're dead.

37:16.972 --> 37:19.674
I'll finish the job myself,
then spit on your wife's grave!

37:19.676 --> 37:21.583
How is it that Ness
is still alive?

37:21.585 --> 37:23.043
You said
the poison worked.

37:23.045 --> 37:25.234
Finish the job!

37:25.236 --> 37:26.976
You son of a bitch.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.139
You're dead.

37:28.140 --> 37:29.765
You hear me?

37:29.767 --> 37:32.369
I don't care how many times
I have to kill you!

37:38.346 --> 37:40.800
Can you keep him on the phone,
Mr. Beale?

37:40.802 --> 37:42.327
I could only cut together

37:42.329 --> 37:44.485
so much of Callen
and Ness's conversation

37:44.487 --> 37:47.006
before it became
conspicuously repetitive.

37:48.635 --> 37:50.177
Where do we go, Eric?

37:51.656 --> 37:53.198
You're looking for double doors.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.686
Two of his men are still with
Barbosa and Javier.

37:55.688 --> 37:58.591
Callen, you're about
to get some company.

38:19.751 --> 38:22.156
Sorry that it's
come to this.

38:22.158 --> 38:25.674
Mr. Deeks, Ms. Blye,
Javier is out of time.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.587
Shoot! Do it!

38:50.089 --> 38:52.559
It was the
only way, Javier.

38:52.561 --> 38:55.049
I had to test
your loyalty.

38:55.051 --> 38:57.307
I was never
going to kill you.

38:57.309 --> 38:58.468
You understand?

38:58.470 --> 39:00.460
Javier, he's lying.

39:00.462 --> 39:02.185
That's what he does.

39:02.187 --> 39:03.512
You know that now.

39:03.514 --> 39:05.070
No.

39:05.073 --> 39:06.997
You're like a son to me.

39:06.999 --> 39:08.722
You know that.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.106
You have to trust me.

39:12.108 --> 39:14.234
Okay? You trust me?

39:15.374 --> 39:18.136
We're going to
leave now, okay?

39:18.138 --> 39:20.598
Let's go.
Sorry.

40:00.064 --> 40:03.580
Javier, you did good.

40:08.891 --> 40:12.123
You did good.

40:35.306 --> 40:37.332
I got you.

40:45.826 --> 40:47.467
Was it the
longest debrief ever?

40:47.469 --> 40:49.393
One day somebody might
offer me a desk job--

40:49.395 --> 40:51.888
if I accept it, you have
permission to shoot me on sight.

40:51.890 --> 40:53.162
Done.

40:53.164 --> 40:54.837
Javier make it
back to Mexico?

40:54.839 --> 40:56.746
On his way now.

40:56.748 --> 40:58.137
Now that his
singing career is over,

40:58.139 --> 40:59.426
it's a fresh new start.

40:59.428 --> 41:02.207
Why is it over? Barbosa
and his closest guys are dead,

41:02.209 --> 41:03.379
he's young and talented...

41:03.381 --> 41:06.478
And his record label
is a drug cartel.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.606
He should be applying
to colleges.

41:08.608 --> 41:09.911
That's right,
that's what I'm saying--

41:09.913 --> 41:11.202
he's got other options
besides <i>narcocorrido,</i>

41:11.204 --> 41:13.212
you know what I mean?
I'm sure that Mexico

41:13.214 --> 41:15.306
has their own version
of <i>The Voice.</i>

41:15.308 --> 41:16.847
That's what
you came up with?

41:16.849 --> 41:17.869
I'll have you know

41:17.871 --> 41:19.493
that the winners end up
broke a year later.

41:19.495 --> 41:20.531
Did you get a sitter?

41:20.533 --> 41:22.358
No. Out of luck.

41:22.360 --> 41:23.571
You're gonna have to take

41:23.573 --> 41:25.680
someone else
to the Clippers game.

41:25.682 --> 41:28.354
Where's Paris Summerskill
these days?

41:28.356 --> 41:31.493
She's in Des Moines.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.479
I'll do it.

41:36.311 --> 41:38.103
You will?

41:41.061 --> 41:42.921
I'll do it.

41:42.923 --> 41:45.295
What changed your mind?

41:45.297 --> 41:46.624
Yeah, what changed your mind?

41:46.626 --> 41:49.812
Besides the fantasy of little
Martys running to and fro.

41:49.814 --> 41:51.273
God...

41:52.105 --> 41:53.582
I don't know.

41:53.584 --> 41:55.741
Just helping Javier...

41:55.743 --> 41:57.618
it felt different.

41:57.620 --> 41:59.578
Felt good.
Wow.

41:59.580 --> 42:01.554
This...

42:01.556 --> 42:03.548
changes everything.

42:03.550 --> 42:05.491
Thank you, Kensi.

42:06.372 --> 42:09.078
I do have one condition, though.

42:09.080 --> 42:10.207
Name it.

42:10.209 --> 42:12.183
Deeks helps me watch your kids.

42:12.683 --> 42:13.906
What?!

42:13.908 --> 42:15.414
Look, I am taking a leap here

42:15.416 --> 42:16.553
with this babysitting thing.

42:16.555 --> 42:18.883
It would be really nice
to have my partner there

42:18.885 --> 42:20.391
to back me up.

42:20.393 --> 42:22.536
That is,
if he takes me up on it.

42:22.538 --> 42:23.877
You want to play house?

42:23.879 --> 42:26.860
They want to play house, Sam.

42:26.862 --> 42:30.245
At your house,
when you're not there.

42:30.247 --> 42:31.922
Oh, yeah?

42:33.180 --> 42:35.525
I have nanny cams.

42:35.527 --> 42:37.116
Everywhere.

42:37.118 --> 42:39.765
That's okay, 'cause I do
some of my best work on camera.

42:39.767 --> 42:41.632
Oh, thank you for an image
I will never be able

42:41.658 --> 42:43.201
to get out of my head.

42:43.202 --> 42:45.412
Is that so wrong?
I'm just getting it done.

42:46.728 --> 42:51.751
== sync, corrected by elderman ==

42:53.844 --> 42:56.641
<i>They grow up so fast.</i>
