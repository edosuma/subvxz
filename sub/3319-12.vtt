WEBVTT

00:04.830 --> 00:05.918
I'm thinking about
going vegan.

00:06.006 --> 00:09.052
Really? Why?

00:09.139 --> 00:11.663
Diet, health,
compassion for animals?

00:11.750 --> 00:14.753
I'm not happy with
how my urine smells.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.453
Then stop smelling it.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.544
Oh, don't look.Don't smell, don't look.

00:22.631 --> 00:23.936
You're bossy today.

00:26.374 --> 00:26.939
Isn't that the chef
from your restaurant?

00:27.027 --> 00:28.724
Yeah.

00:28.811 --> 00:29.594
He's kind of cute.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.118
No, he's not.

00:31.205 --> 00:32.683
Everyone at work
is terrified of him.

00:32.771 --> 00:34.947
How scary can he be?
He's carrying a purse.

00:36.427 --> 00:38.299
Ah, hello there.

00:38.386 --> 00:40.127
Damn. Hi.

00:41.780 --> 00:44.653
Chef Rudy, good to see you.

00:44.740 --> 00:45.828
Good to see you, too,

00:45.915 --> 00:47.612
I want to say... Meredith?

00:47.699 --> 00:49.658
Christy.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.486
Right. And your mother Bonnie.

00:51.573 --> 00:52.617
Oh.

00:52.704 --> 00:55.055
I work with you every day,

00:55.142 --> 00:57.753
and her you remember?

00:57.840 --> 01:01.104
Does a thirsty man forget
a tall glass of water?

01:02.714 --> 01:04.063
May I join you?

01:05.108 --> 01:06.588
Sure.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.112
So, my daughter tells
me everyone at work

01:09.199 --> 01:11.114
is frightened of you.

01:11.201 --> 01:12.072
Ooh, that's very sweet.
Thank you.

01:14.944 --> 01:16.598
So, what kind
of naughtiness

01:16.685 --> 01:19.035
is the mother-daughter
team up to today?

01:19.122 --> 01:20.384
Don't go there.

01:20.471 --> 01:24.345
Mmm, too late.
Mental snapshot. Click.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.392
We've just come back
from the drugstore,

01:28.479 --> 01:30.394
where we bought
some, you know...

01:30.481 --> 01:31.482
girl stuff.

01:31.569 --> 01:32.135
Click.

01:32.222 --> 01:34.094
[laughs]

01:34.181 --> 01:36.966
What are you
up to today?

01:37.053 --> 01:40.317
Oh, just blowing
the dust off my Spyder.

01:40.404 --> 01:43.015
Beg pardon?I have a vintage
Porsche Spyder.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.365
She's high-strung,
impulsive,

01:44.452 --> 01:45.844
and if I don't
ride her hard

01:45.931 --> 01:48.195
at least once a day,
she misbehaves.

01:48.282 --> 01:49.021
I'm the same way.

01:51.589 --> 01:52.242
Click.

01:52.329 --> 01:54.505
[giggles]

01:54.592 --> 01:56.681
Aw, all out of film.

01:56.768 --> 01:59.597
Yeah. I will
bid you adieu.

01:59.684 --> 02:00.685
A la prochaine.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.165
Yeah, I just know "adieu."

02:04.080 --> 02:06.822
Tell me you haven't tapped that.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.085
Of course not.

02:09.172 --> 02:11.566
Good.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.935
Can I ask you
a little friendly advice

02:33.022 --> 02:35.503
vis-Ã -vis my
personal affairs?

02:35.590 --> 02:37.287
Oh. Yeah.
Sure.

02:37.374 --> 02:40.203
Great. What are my chances
of bedding your mother?

02:41.204 --> 02:43.032
What?

02:43.119 --> 02:44.773
I felt there was
chemistry between us.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.992
But I feel that with
a lot of women, often with

02:47.079 --> 02:49.908
disastrous results.

02:49.995 --> 02:51.475
Fun fact:

02:51.562 --> 02:53.173
pepper spray tastes
nothing like pepper.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.437
All right,

02:56.524 --> 02:57.655
look...

02:57.742 --> 02:59.266
[sighs]

02:59.353 --> 03:01.790
I don't want
to get involved here, but...

03:01.877 --> 03:05.228
I will tell you she was
quite taken with you.

03:05.315 --> 03:07.274
Oh, I knew it.

03:07.361 --> 03:10.929
When I walked out of that coffee
shop, my testicles were on fire.

03:12.801 --> 03:15.107
You might want
to get those looked at.

03:16.848 --> 03:19.460
That's what
I'm trying to do.

03:21.418 --> 03:23.246
Be a dear, get her
on the phone for me.

03:23.333 --> 03:27.424
Okay, but I got to warn
you about my mother.

03:27.511 --> 03:30.297
There's a little crazy
up in them thar hills.

03:30.384 --> 03:31.428
Mm-hmm.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.169
Well, you know what they say,

03:33.256 --> 03:35.302
"nothing soils the sheets
like crazy."

03:37.304 --> 03:39.131
How are you allowed
to touch food?

03:42.831 --> 03:44.659
Hi, Mom, it's me.

03:44.746 --> 03:48.053
I'm probably going
to regret this, but...

03:49.925 --> 03:51.492
He's right here.

03:53.145 --> 03:55.409
Hey, you.

03:55.496 --> 03:57.411
Been ridden hard
yet, today?

04:03.330 --> 04:07.899
Aah, clickety-click,
click, click.

04:14.428 --> 04:15.385
Is Grandma having
dinner with us?

04:15.472 --> 04:18.257
No, she's
got a date.

04:18.345 --> 04:19.389
Cool. You know the guy?

04:19.476 --> 04:21.216
I do.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.088
So, do you think
they'll hit it off?

04:23.175 --> 04:26.091
I'm thinking murder-suicide.

04:26.178 --> 04:28.268
It's so weird to think
of your grandma dating.

04:28.355 --> 04:31.140
My grandma weighs 300 pounds
and has one leg.

04:31.227 --> 04:35.013
Well, doesn't mean there's
not someone out there for her.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.885
That's true.

04:36.972 --> 04:40.018
My grandfather would sure
love it if she met somebody.

04:40.105 --> 04:41.019
[knocking]

04:41.106 --> 04:42.151
Oh, I'll get it.

04:43.979 --> 04:47.417
Well, grandma will be easy
to spot at the wedding.

04:52.030 --> 04:54.163
Well, you must be Violet.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.383
No, I-I'm Luke.

04:56.470 --> 04:59.081
Well, you're very pretty,
nonetheless.

04:59.168 --> 05:00.561
Bonnie here?

05:00.648 --> 05:02.171
Uh, she's getting
ready. Come on in.

05:02.258 --> 05:04.129
Welcome.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.914
Thank you.

05:06.001 --> 05:09.178
Well, I had you pegged
for a house on wheels.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.267
That's the dream.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.051
Can I get you
something to drink?

05:13.138 --> 05:15.140
I wouldn't mind a glass
of pinot grigio.

05:15.227 --> 05:18.056
I wouldn't mind a bucket of gin.

05:18.143 --> 05:21.321
But, uh, all we've got
is tap water and milk.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.757
Mmm. I'll pass.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.149
What am I smelling?

05:24.236 --> 05:26.064
I made dinner.

05:26.151 --> 05:27.588
No, that can't be it.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.852
Do you have pets?

05:30.939 --> 05:32.201
It's corned beef and cabbage.

05:32.288 --> 05:35.422
Oh, yes, poor people food.

05:35.509 --> 05:37.815
My apologies.
It smells delicious.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.036
Ready to go?

05:41.123 --> 05:43.212
Oh, well, there's a
tasty morsel. Yum, yum.

05:43.299 --> 05:45.127
Thank you.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.302
He's gonna eat her?

05:49.087 --> 05:50.350
Shall we?Did you bring the Spyder?

05:50.437 --> 05:51.394
Freshly lubed
for your pleasure.

05:51.481 --> 05:55.137
Ooh! Bye, family.

05:55.224 --> 05:57.400
Have fun.

05:57.487 --> 05:58.880
Are we poor people?

05:58.967 --> 06:01.709
Of course not.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.145
Now, eat your boiled meat.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.672
Wow, that was
quite an education,

06:08.759 --> 06:11.458
watching a master chef
shop for groceries.

06:11.545 --> 06:14.635
Well, I think it's
important to feel and smell

06:14.722 --> 06:17.202
the things we put inside us.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.729
I got to tell you,
if I'm smelling it,

06:21.816 --> 06:24.340
I'm not feeling it.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.386
So, um, what are we having?

06:26.473 --> 06:29.301
Well, it's a tasting menu
that I call

06:29.389 --> 06:33.567
"Seven Small Explosions
in Your Mouth."

06:37.092 --> 06:38.180
Seven, huh?

06:38.267 --> 06:39.529
Let's see.

06:39.616 --> 06:43.228
Salty, sweet,
savory, sour...

06:43.315 --> 06:45.230
Help me.

06:45.317 --> 06:47.972
Crunchy, creamy and Rudy.

06:50.018 --> 06:51.019
Ooh.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.934
What's Rudy taste like?

06:53.021 --> 06:55.153
Pistachios, I've been told.

06:56.198 --> 06:57.721
Mm.

06:57.808 --> 06:59.157
But the real magic happens

06:59.244 --> 07:00.985
when we start
to combine flavors.

07:01.072 --> 07:02.334
For example,

07:02.422 --> 07:04.380
take a simple
cherry tomato.

07:04.467 --> 07:07.470
Squirt a little aged
balsamic vinegar

07:07.557 --> 07:09.472
into its fleshy center.

07:09.559 --> 07:12.301
"Cherry," "squirt," "fleshy."

07:12.388 --> 07:14.564
You can't help yourself,
can you?

07:14.651 --> 07:16.348
It's very hard.

07:22.398 --> 07:24.792
Mmm!

07:24.879 --> 07:28.491
That's not sweet like a tomato
or sour like vinegar.

07:28.578 --> 07:29.884
Exactly.

07:29.971 --> 07:31.625
It's a third thing
that didn't exist

07:31.712 --> 07:34.236
until one was driven
deep inside the other.

07:37.631 --> 07:42.070
And yes, I know
what I just said.

07:42.157 --> 07:43.550
Where'd you go
to culinary school?

07:43.637 --> 07:46.074
Can you keep a secret?Of course.

07:46.161 --> 07:46.553
A Denny's in Boston.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.339
I worked the late shift;

07:50.426 --> 07:51.471
there's a lot of time
to screw around.

07:53.429 --> 07:55.039
Where's the Boston accent?

07:55.126 --> 07:56.519
I dropped it.

07:56.606 --> 07:57.999
[Boston accent]:
Hard to charge 60 bucks

07:58.086 --> 07:58.913
for lobster chowder
with capers.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.610
Ah.Yeah.

08:00.697 --> 08:02.177
Well, where
are my manners?

08:02.264 --> 08:03.831
Can I get you
a glass of wine?

08:03.918 --> 08:05.746
No, thank you.
I don't drink.

08:05.833 --> 08:06.355
Never?

08:06.442 --> 08:07.443
Never.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.967
Impressive.

08:10.054 --> 08:12.709
How is it that you have not
killed yourself?

08:12.796 --> 08:16.452
I'm more of a homicide girl.

08:16.539 --> 08:20.369
Well, then, as a good host,
I won't drink, either.

08:26.418 --> 08:28.377
Ah, who am I kidding?

08:29.726 --> 08:31.380
So, why do you abstain?

08:31.467 --> 08:33.207
I'm allergic to alcohol.

08:33.294 --> 08:34.383
Every time I drink,
I break out in handcuffs.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.385
Mm.

08:36.472 --> 08:37.908
Pity.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.082
I have a rather
remarkable collection

08:39.169 --> 08:40.868
of wine andhandcuffs.

08:40.955 --> 08:42.739
You know,

08:42.826 --> 08:46.438
next to great food, beautiful
women and vintage cars,

08:46.526 --> 08:48.484
wine is what brings me
the most happiness.

08:48.571 --> 08:52.575
No, actually,
it's women, then food...

08:52.662 --> 08:54.185
No, wine, women...

08:54.272 --> 08:55.665
Ah, I left out pills.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.669
It's pills, wine...I get the point.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.544
Let's see how sophisticated
your palate is. Hmm?

09:04.631 --> 09:06.415
Put on this blindfold.

09:06.502 --> 09:10.071
Well, I usually charge 50 bucks
extra for that, but okay.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.510
I knew I liked you.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.468
[giggles]

09:16.556 --> 09:19.080
And... you ready?

09:19.167 --> 09:20.603
Do it.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.562
What do you taste?

09:22.649 --> 09:25.869
Mmm. Fig?

09:25.956 --> 09:27.175
Very good.

09:27.262 --> 09:29.394
Now, try this.

09:31.005 --> 09:32.136
Mmm.

09:35.009 --> 09:36.619
Eel?

09:36.706 --> 09:39.970
And here comes
the pistachios.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.245
Morning.

09:57.553 --> 09:58.772
Walk of shame?

09:58.859 --> 10:02.471
Stride of pride.

10:02.558 --> 10:04.691
Did you consider,
for even a minute,

10:04.778 --> 10:06.344
to go slow with this guy?

10:06.431 --> 10:07.781
See a movie,

10:07.868 --> 10:10.000
shop at the flea market,

10:10.087 --> 10:11.785
text him a picture
of your boobs.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.525
You know,

10:13.613 --> 10:14.657
like a lady.

10:14.744 --> 10:15.397
I did think about it.

10:15.484 --> 10:17.442
And?

10:17.529 --> 10:20.620
I chose instead to do him
on the floor of his kitchen.

10:20.707 --> 10:23.405
What is wrong with you?

10:23.492 --> 10:25.407
Don't you have any self-respect?

10:25.494 --> 10:28.497
Oh, please. Self-respect is for
women who spend Saturday night

10:28.584 --> 10:30.717
alone with their showerhead
set on pulse.

10:32.719 --> 10:36.331
That's a terrible thing to say.

10:36.418 --> 10:39.813
And I happen to have
a stiff neck from work.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.685
Did it ever occur to you
that what happened last night

10:42.772 --> 10:45.645
between me and Rudolph was the
start of something wonderful?

10:45.732 --> 10:48.256
Oh, wake up!

10:48.343 --> 10:50.998
It's a one-night stand
between a middle-aged alcoholic

10:51.085 --> 10:52.390
and a sex addict.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.654
How dare you
call me middle-aged?

10:56.786 --> 10:58.527
And it was not
a one-night stand.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.485
Rudy and I are two ingredients,
which, when combined,

11:00.572 --> 11:03.663
create a third thing which...
never existed before.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.014
What the hell
are you talking about?

11:07.101 --> 11:08.537
I don't know;
it's a tomato thing!

11:11.061 --> 11:14.543
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go take a shower.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.502
To clean myself.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.767
You'll never be clean!

11:20.854 --> 11:21.811
[door slams]

11:30.602 --> 11:33.736
So, are we gonna
talk about it?

11:33.823 --> 11:37.348
Well, I was gonna be a gentleman
and spare you the details,

11:37.435 --> 11:38.828
but as you wish.

11:38.915 --> 11:41.309
Your mother
is sleek yet powerful,

11:41.396 --> 11:42.614
like an enormous greyhound.

11:42.702 --> 11:43.877
Yeah, great.

11:43.964 --> 11:45.705
Not what I want to talk about.

11:45.792 --> 11:49.143
I... I just want
to put it out there

11:49.230 --> 11:53.103
that no matter where your
relationship goes with her,

11:53.190 --> 11:57.107
you and I maintain a
professional relationship here.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.979
Okay, two things wrong
with that, Meredith.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.374
First of all,
you and I don't have

12:03.461 --> 12:05.115
a professional relationship.

12:05.202 --> 12:05.942
I'm a world-class chef,
and you are a waitress.

12:06.029 --> 12:07.596
And no offense,

12:07.683 --> 12:09.685
but I would be just as happy
to put my food

12:09.772 --> 12:13.689
on a tiny toy train that
choo-choos into the dining room.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.301
And secondly,

12:17.388 --> 12:19.434
I have absolutely
no plans

12:19.521 --> 12:21.653
to pursue a relationship
with your mommy.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.440
What?

12:25.527 --> 12:29.574
I thought the two of you
made a third thing.

12:30.706 --> 12:31.620
With a tomato.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.754
No, that's just my rap

12:34.841 --> 12:37.495
when I'm trying
to filet some panties.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.628
Oh.

12:39.715 --> 12:44.198
So, you're not planning
on seeing her again?

12:44.285 --> 12:45.373
Oh, God, no.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.809
Well, never say never.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.246
Can't have a Russian hooker
every night.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.688
I don't believe this.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.430
[sighs] What kind
of a man are you?

12:59.517 --> 13:01.215
Well, selfish, narcissistic,

13:01.302 --> 13:02.782
emotionally crippled
by a cold and distant mother.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.696
You know, the usual.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.352
She's gonna
be devastated.

13:08.439 --> 13:10.398
Well, then you better
break it to her gently.

13:10.485 --> 13:12.182
I'm not gonna tell her.

13:12.269 --> 13:13.575
Wow, that seems cruel.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.098
But your call.

13:16.491 --> 13:17.971
What's going on?

13:18.058 --> 13:20.016
That pig slept with my mother.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.628
Welcome to the club.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.246
Hey.

13:32.333 --> 13:33.551
Hey.

13:33.638 --> 13:34.857
Roscoe asleep?Yup.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.166
What'd you do tonight?

13:39.253 --> 13:40.254
What do you care?

13:40.341 --> 13:41.733
Oh, come on.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.561
I'm sorry about this morning.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.650
Really? So, you admit
that Rudy and I

13:45.737 --> 13:48.436
are capable of having
a meaningful relationship?

13:48.523 --> 13:50.394
Well...

13:50.481 --> 13:52.614
I admit that I love you.

13:54.311 --> 13:56.313
All right, what's going on?

13:56.400 --> 13:58.359
[sighs]

14:00.317 --> 14:00.709
Rudy's done with you.

14:02.754 --> 14:04.713
Well, why are you
telling me instead of him?

14:05.757 --> 14:07.803
Because...

14:07.890 --> 14:10.110
he was emotionally
crippled by his mother.

14:12.982 --> 14:14.288
And, you know...

14:14.375 --> 14:15.724
he's a giant douche.

14:17.769 --> 14:20.294
Wow, so I completely
misread him.

14:20.381 --> 14:22.296
I'm so sorry.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.471
No, you warned me.

14:23.558 --> 14:24.646
I'm a big girl.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.039
I should have known better.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.172
Look at me,
giving myself a pedicure

14:29.259 --> 14:31.783
so that jerk could
suckle on a pretty red toe.

14:33.611 --> 14:35.265
Is that his thing?

14:35.352 --> 14:36.919
Oh, yeah, he's got a mouth
like a Chinese finger trap.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.924
My fault, I asked.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.665
All right, I'm gonna
take a quick shower.

14:43.752 --> 14:46.059
Say hi to your boyfriend.

14:49.236 --> 14:53.501
I would, but after
he saw you naked, we broke up.

14:55.633 --> 14:56.808
Are you gonna be all right?

14:56.896 --> 14:57.897
Oh, yeah.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.379
Not gonna do
anything crazy?

15:02.466 --> 15:03.859
Oh, come on,
go take a shower.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.382
Okay.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.471
[sighs]

15:23.661 --> 15:25.968
It's like she doesn't
know me at all.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.542
Yes, I want a medium
meat lover's pizza

15:34.629 --> 15:35.978
with cheese in the crust.

15:36.065 --> 15:38.763
Yes, and some crazy bread.

15:41.114 --> 15:41.897
Hello, Rudolph.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.986
Bonnie.

15:44.073 --> 15:46.336
How'd you get in my house?

15:46.423 --> 15:48.034
Oh, please.
Who sleeps with a man

15:48.121 --> 15:50.036
and doesn't steal
his spare keys?

15:51.124 --> 15:53.300
Okay. What do you want?

15:53.387 --> 15:54.910
What I want is to hurt you.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.913
But not physically, because...

15:58.000 --> 16:00.524
you might like that.

16:00.611 --> 16:03.527
But on an emotional level,
like you hurt me.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.834
No, you are barking up
the wrong tree, sister,

16:05.921 --> 16:08.010
because I stopped
feeling years ago.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.446
Really?

16:09.533 --> 16:11.405
We'll see.

16:11.492 --> 16:13.407
Hmm.

16:13.494 --> 16:16.801
"1957 ChÃ¢teau Latour."

16:16.888 --> 16:17.846
Ooh, sounds fancy.

16:21.937 --> 16:25.288
[groaning]

16:29.249 --> 16:31.164
Thank you.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.166
And for my next trick,

16:33.253 --> 16:36.517
I will attempt to juggle
three bottles of...

16:36.604 --> 16:39.215
ooh, Montrachet.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.000
Oh, ooh, ooh.

16:43.176 --> 16:44.351
Aw.

16:44.438 --> 16:47.223
I'm not very good.

16:49.747 --> 16:51.706
[high-pitched groaning]

16:56.841 --> 16:58.843
[high-pitched wail]

17:01.846 --> 17:05.241
Okay, I lied.
I didn't just get clean.

17:06.982 --> 17:08.983
Mom?

17:10.681 --> 17:12.683
Mom?

17:13.641 --> 17:15.034
Oh, damn it!

17:18.646 --> 17:21.474
No.

17:21.561 --> 17:25.131
And this Mouton Rothschild
is for little Jimmy,

17:25.218 --> 17:26.871
who's sick in the hospital.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.527
Please, no more.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.877
And this Chateau Montelena
is for all the wine snobs

17:32.964 --> 17:35.054
and their nutty top notes.

17:37.926 --> 17:38.448
[Boston accent]:
Enough!

17:38.535 --> 17:39.928
Stop!

17:40.015 --> 17:41.973
I can't take it anymore.

17:42.061 --> 17:42.974
Good.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.716
Come to me.

17:45.803 --> 17:48.067
Oh, my God, you're magnificent.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.289
Now what?

17:56.031 --> 17:57.598
Suckle.

18:10.393 --> 18:12.569
Hello?

18:17.661 --> 18:19.750
Oh, my God, I'm too late.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.535
RUDY [Boston accent]:
Ah, ah, oh, yeah, Bonnie,

18:21.622 --> 18:24.015
right there, wicked hard!

18:27.062 --> 18:29.412
Who the hell is that?

18:37.464 --> 18:39.553
Mmm.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.424
Oh, my God.

18:41.511 --> 18:44.819
This duck pÃ¢tÃ© is so much
better than corned beef.

18:44.906 --> 18:47.909
Yeah, and the house won't
smell like a thousand egg farts.

18:47.996 --> 18:48.518
[phone ringing]

18:48.605 --> 18:49.519
Mm.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.481
Hello.

18:54.568 --> 18:55.830
Oh, hi, Chef Rudy.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.397
Thanks for the
picnic basket.

18:57.484 --> 19:00.487
Yeah, I know
it's not for me.

19:00.574 --> 19:03.229
What's up?

19:03.316 --> 19:05.970
Hang on, let me
see if she's here.

19:06.057 --> 19:06.754
[mouthing]

19:06.841 --> 19:09.452
She's not here.

19:09.539 --> 19:11.498
Can I take a message?

19:11.585 --> 19:13.413
Oh, s-slow down,
let me grab a pen.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.158
Go ahead.

19:23.292 --> 19:26.077
"The... the
dark, violent turn

19:26.165 --> 19:29.255
our love play took
last night haunts me."

19:36.523 --> 19:38.133
Wait, say again.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.790
"The wine cork will
remain where it is

19:42.877 --> 19:44.792
as a sign of
my commitment."

19:44.879 --> 19:46.881
[loud pop]

19:49.275 --> 19:53.148
All right, I'll be sure
she gets the message.

19:53.235 --> 19:55.759
Of course I won't tell
anyone at the restaurant.

19:58.632 --> 20:00.199
Bye-bye.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.985
I think someone's
sweet on you.
