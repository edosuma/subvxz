WEBVTT

00:13.247 --> 00:15.383
It's kinda blurry.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.688
That's better.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.192
[inhales, exhales]

00:25.226 --> 00:27.128
Question.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.297
What kind of bear
is best?

00:29.330 --> 00:31.499
That's a ridiculous question.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.301
False.
Black bear.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.835
Well, that's debatable.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.737
There are basically
two schools of thought--

00:36.770 --> 00:39.107
Fact.
Bears eat beets.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.309
Bears. Beets.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.810
Battlestar Galactica.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.646
Bears do not--
What is going on?

00:45.679 --> 00:47.148
What are you doing?

00:47.181 --> 00:49.150
Last week,
I was in a drugstore,

00:49.183 --> 00:50.651
and I saw these glasses.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.353
Uh, $4.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.122
And it only cost me $7.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.190
to recreate the rest
of the ensemble,

00:56.224 --> 00:59.093
and that's a grand total of...

00:59.127 --> 01:01.429
$11.

01:01.462 --> 01:02.663
You know what?

01:02.696 --> 01:04.498
Imitation is the most
sincere form of flattery.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.734
So I thank you.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.736
Identity theft
is not a joke, Jim!

01:08.769 --> 01:12.106
Millions of families suffer
every year!

01:12.140 --> 01:13.707
Michael!

01:13.741 --> 01:14.842
Oh, that's funny.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.477
Michael!

01:16.510 --> 01:18.879
[cheerful music]

01:18.912 --> 01:27.121
*

01:49.577 --> 01:50.911
Yes, I understand.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.813
Can I transfer you
to Customer Relations?

01:52.846 --> 01:53.747
Absolutely.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.516
I couldn't be
more sorry about this.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.285
(Phyllis)
I know, I know.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.487
We're all trying to get
to the bottom of this.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.155
(Stanley)
I am upset.
Don't I sound upset?

02:01.189 --> 02:02.390
[voices overlapping]

02:02.423 --> 02:03.824
(Michael)
I totally agree.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.894
Well, we're going to be
recalling all of that paper.

02:06.927 --> 02:09.163
We have a crisis.

02:09.197 --> 02:11.232
Apparently, a disgruntled
employee at the paper mill

02:11.265 --> 02:14.535
decided that it would be funny
to put an obscene watermark

02:14.568 --> 02:17.871
on our 24-pound
cream letter stock.

02:17.905 --> 02:21.175
500 boxes has gone out

02:21.209 --> 02:24.178
with the image
of a beloved cartoon duck

02:24.212 --> 02:26.547
performing...

02:26.580 --> 02:29.550
unspeakable acts
upon a...

02:29.583 --> 02:33.287
certain cartoon mouse
that a lot of people like.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.323
I've never been a fan.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.358
Everybody in here, STAT.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.660
No time to lose.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.730
Cry-Man Squaw, F and C,
double time.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.498
Cry-Man Squaw?

02:44.532 --> 02:45.833
Crisis Management Squad.

02:45.866 --> 02:46.867
F and C, double time?

02:46.900 --> 02:48.236
Front and center,

02:48.269 --> 02:49.903
twice as fast
as you would normally go.

02:49.937 --> 02:50.971
Any other questions?
One more.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.374
Why are you talking like that?
To save time, Jim.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.875
Actually, I think
you could make the argument

02:54.908 --> 02:55.776
that it wastes time.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.811
(Pam)
Yeah, she has a good point.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.880
I mean, for example,
with the last thing you said,

02:59.913 --> 03:01.782
by the time
you explained it,

03:01.815 --> 03:02.683
it actually took up
more time.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.285
You know what?
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.420
Forget it.
Where's Creed?

03:06.454 --> 03:07.988
Creed, quality assurance.
Here.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.657
Your job.

03:09.690 --> 03:13.261
I really think you screwed
the pooch on this one, Creed.

03:13.294 --> 03:16.497
Because of you, the entire
company is in jeopardy.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.998
[sighs]

03:18.031 --> 03:19.667
Every week, I'm supposed
to take four hours

03:19.700 --> 03:22.002
and do a quality spot-check
at the paper mill.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.638
And, of course,
the one year I blow it off,

03:24.672 --> 03:26.907
this happens.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.842
We have a lot of angry
customers out there.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.811
This puts us
at threat level Midnight.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.981
Accounting, you are on customer
service duty today.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.249
That's really
not our job.

03:35.283 --> 03:36.917
Midnight, Oscar!

03:36.950 --> 03:39.387
Don't worry, Kelly will be
training you first.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.489
Kelly's training us?

03:41.522 --> 03:43.657
[Kelly, chanting]
This day is bananas.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.459
B-A-N-A-N-A-S.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.261
This day is bananas.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.496
B-A-N-A...

03:48.529 --> 03:49.963
[pills rattling]

03:50.898 --> 03:53.667
I don't have a headache.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.703
I'm just preparing.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.872
Jim, big fire
in your house.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.974
Your client,
Dunmore High School,

04:01.008 --> 04:03.944
sent out their prom invitations
on this paper.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.314
Went home
to all the kids.
Yeah, I got a call out on them.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.481
No, no, no.
Not good enough.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.882
This is a keystone account.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.618
I want you in the school.
In person.

04:10.651 --> 04:11.885
Sure.
I want you to bring
a partner.

04:11.919 --> 04:12.853
I'll go.
No, sweet cheeks.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.688
We need somebody
who's actually made a sale.

04:14.722 --> 04:15.923
Andy, you go.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.291
[cockney accent]
William Dolittle,

04:17.325 --> 04:18.826
at your service.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.429
AKA, Will Do.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.331
Yeah, I'm definitely
gonna go alone.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.299
No, no.
I need two men on this.

04:25.333 --> 04:26.800
That's what she said.
No time!

04:26.834 --> 04:28.636
But she did.
No time!

04:28.669 --> 04:29.870
Guys, get on this!

04:29.903 --> 04:32.740
Dwight, I want you to be in
charge of the press conference.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.576
Yes! You're entering
the "No Spin Zone."

04:35.609 --> 04:37.445
We're having
a press conference?

04:37.478 --> 04:39.813
No, Pam, the press is just
gonna find out by themselves.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.416
Not.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.417
Here's the thing.

04:43.451 --> 04:44.485
When a company screws up,

04:44.518 --> 04:46.387
best thing to do is to call
a press conference.

04:46.420 --> 04:49.457
Alert the media,
and then you control the story.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.760
Wait for them to find out,
and the story controls you.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.795
That's what happened to O.J.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.664
I have invited Barbara Allen,

04:56.697 --> 04:58.932
one of our oldest clients,
to come in here

04:58.966 --> 05:01.869
and meet with me
for a personal apology.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.705
The press wants a story.
I will give them a story.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.840
Oh, did the press
ask for a story?

05:06.874 --> 05:08.576
Here is your headline.

05:08.609 --> 05:12.513
"Scranton-area paper company,
Dunder-Mifflin,

05:12.546 --> 05:16.016
"apologizes to valued client.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.919
"Some companies still know

05:18.952 --> 05:21.789
how business is done."

05:21.822 --> 05:22.790
Okay?

05:22.823 --> 05:23.957
[claps hands]

05:23.991 --> 05:26.760
Battle stations, everybody.
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

05:26.794 --> 05:27.561
Yes, hello.

05:27.595 --> 05:28.996
Creed Bratton,
Quality Assurance.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.864
Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.867
I was supposed to meet
with one of your floor managers

05:33.901 --> 05:35.936
last week
for a quality inspection,

05:35.969 --> 05:38.872
and he or she wasn't there.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.575
And I'm trying to remember
who it was.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.911
Mm-hmm.
Who wasn't there last week?

05:45.513 --> 05:48.582
Debbie Brown.
And which day was that?

05:48.616 --> 05:51.685
Wednesday the 11th.
Perfect.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.554
The only difference
between me and a homeless man

05:53.587 --> 05:54.888
is this job.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.890
I will do whatever it takes
to survive.

05:56.924 --> 06:00.027
Like I did...
when I was a homeless man.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.630
Look, I know the reason
that you guys became accountants

06:02.663 --> 06:04.532
is 'cause you're not good
at interacting with people.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.866
But guess what?

06:05.899 --> 06:07.801
From now on,
you guys are no longer losers.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.970
So give yourselves
a round of applause.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.441
I wonder how many
phone calls you're missing

06:13.474 --> 06:15.409
while you're teaching us
to answer calls.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.810
I know, right?
Probably a lot.

06:16.844 --> 06:17.978
(Angela)
Can you just tell us

06:18.011 --> 06:19.146
what we need to do
so we can go?

06:19.179 --> 06:21.782
Okay, Angela.
I love your enthusiasm.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.951
All you need to know how to do
is pick up the phone and say,

06:23.984 --> 06:25.719
"Customer Service.
This is Kelly."

06:25.753 --> 06:27.755
Except don't say Kelly.
Say your own name.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.790
Or, if you're bored,
you can just make up a name.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.559
Like one time
I said I was Bridget Jones,

06:31.592 --> 06:33.026
[British accent]
and I talked like this

06:33.060 --> 06:34.562
for the whole conversation.

06:34.595 --> 06:35.563
Ooh, can I be...

06:35.596 --> 06:36.897
[awkward accent]
Australian, mate?

06:36.930 --> 06:38.065
[Kelly, British accent]
Absolutely!

06:38.098 --> 06:39.967
[awkwardly]
'Ello, mate.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.636
I like ice cream.
I need a boyfriend.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.738
I like ice cream, too,
mate.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.874
Alli-gators

06:46.907 --> 06:48.909
and dingo babies.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.613
Beer me.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.847
What's that?

06:53.881 --> 06:56.183
Hand me that water.
I always say, "Beer me."

06:56.216 --> 06:58.552
Gets a laugh, like,
a quarter of the time.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.020
So how's what's-her-name?

07:00.053 --> 07:01.689
You know her name.

07:01.722 --> 07:02.956
Who, Karen?

07:02.990 --> 07:04.892
Yeah, she's only one of
my oldest friends.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.127
Mm. How's the apartment
hanging?

07:07.160 --> 07:08.896
It's fine.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.898
Nice.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.601
Check out
this sunshine, man.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.803
Global warming, right?

07:15.836 --> 07:18.639
Today was supposed to be
really cold, I bet.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.475
What about music?
Do you have any music?

07:21.509 --> 07:23.677
Uh, yeah.
Should have said so.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.515
* Rah-dah-dah-dah,
now gimme the beat, boys *

07:27.548 --> 07:28.882
* And free my soul

07:28.916 --> 07:31.752
* I wanna get lost
in your rock and roll *

07:31.785 --> 07:33.954
* And drift away-ay

07:33.987 --> 07:36.790
[scatting]

07:36.824 --> 07:39.727
* Gimme the beat, boys,
and free my little old soul *

07:39.760 --> 07:41.629
I was thinking
more like a CD or...

07:41.662 --> 07:43.263
a CD?

07:43.296 --> 07:44.732
Your call, dude.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.667
My girlfriend
made an awesome mix.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.001
Beer me that disc.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.139
Lord, beer me strength.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.175
So, Tuna, when we
get in there,

07:55.208 --> 07:56.877
let's do a really
good job, okay?

07:56.910 --> 07:58.912
Did that really
need to be said?

07:58.946 --> 08:01.048
Well, not everything
a guy says needs to be said.

08:01.081 --> 08:04.184
Sometimes it's just about
the music of a conversation.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.086
Whoa, what the--

08:06.119 --> 08:08.255
why is my girlfriend here?

08:08.288 --> 08:10.658
Oh, is she that
teacher in the white?

08:10.691 --> 08:14.795
No, she's a part-time
frozen yogurt chef.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.764
Which one is she?

08:16.797 --> 08:18.098
The one
in the green hoodie.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.000
Wow!

08:20.033 --> 08:21.068
I wonder if she's, like,

08:21.101 --> 08:22.936
a guidance counselor
or something?

08:22.970 --> 08:23.937
No.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.238
I don't think so.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.074
She's probably a tutor.
Nope.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.308
She's probably a te--
No.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.610
She's--
No.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.648
Okay, press conference in 45.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.316
Dwight, make sure
this place looks nice.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.618
On it.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.656
Okay, Karen, Ryan, Pam.

08:42.690 --> 08:43.456
Center stage.

08:43.490 --> 08:46.326
Pam, run a comb
through your hair.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.928
(Dwight)
First rule in roadside
beet sales:

08:47.961 --> 08:49.930
put the most
attractive beets on top.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.932
The ones that make you pull
the car over and go,

08:51.965 --> 08:54.034
"Wow, I need this beet
right now."

08:54.067 --> 08:55.969
Those are the money beets.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.104
[door opens]

08:59.940 --> 09:00.908
Hey!
[snaps twice]

09:00.941 --> 09:01.975
Look sharp.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.611
Hey, uh, hi.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.078
Hello.
Dwight Schrute.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.347
And you must be, uh,
from The Washington Post.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.616
Scranton Times.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.150
Chad Lite.
"Lighter Side of Life."

09:10.183 --> 09:12.085
And "Breaking
Corporate News."

09:12.119 --> 09:14.021
And obits.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.789
[under breath]
Oh, dear God.

09:15.823 --> 09:16.857
Okay, here are
your credentials.

09:16.890 --> 09:20.127
You've been granted
level 3 security clearance.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.095
Don't get too excited.
That's out of 20.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.697
Right this way.

09:23.731 --> 09:24.965
Regional Manager Michael Scott

09:24.998 --> 09:26.700
will be addressing the client
in the press room shortly.

09:26.734 --> 09:29.369
Have a seat.
Can I get you a beverage?

09:29.402 --> 09:31.171
Uh, yeah,
I'd like a--
Great.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.709
Oh, Andy,
you know what?

09:35.743 --> 09:37.344
We don't have a lot
of time,

09:37.377 --> 09:39.212
so we should probably--

09:39.246 --> 09:40.881
Jamie.
Andy--oh!

09:40.914 --> 09:42.750
What are you
doing here?
Andy?

09:42.783 --> 09:43.817
Are you a student here?

09:43.851 --> 09:45.285
Oh...yeah.

09:45.318 --> 09:49.089
You never told me
you were in high school.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.158
This is weird.

09:51.191 --> 09:54.061
I gotta go to Spanish.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.933
Oh, my God!

09:59.967 --> 10:01.635
Oh m God.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.339
I had no idea.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.778
Well...that's not gonna
hold up in court.

10:10.811 --> 10:13.013
We didn't do anything
illegal.

10:13.046 --> 10:17.150
Except knock over a mailbox
with her friends.

10:17.184 --> 10:19.319
Sir, yes, you have
a valid point.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.288
I'm sorry.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.692
No, I am so sorry.

10:24.725 --> 10:25.993
Really?
Dickson City.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.327
(Angela)
Excuse me?

10:27.360 --> 10:29.329
Well, I don't see
how that's our fault.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.463
And I've already told you

10:30.497 --> 10:32.666
the official position
of Dunder-Mifflin is apologetic.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.334
So I don't know
what you want from me.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.939
Okay,
first I just wanna say

10:38.972 --> 10:41.441
that you are doing
so good.

10:41.474 --> 10:45.178
Look, you have so many
good qualities

10:45.212 --> 10:47.414
that the one that you
might wanna work on

10:47.447 --> 10:49.917
is...apologizing?

10:51.351 --> 10:54.221
When I went over Wednesday
for the spot check,

10:54.254 --> 10:56.323
I got a call
from Debbie Brown

10:56.356 --> 10:59.026
saying she has an emergency
dentist appointment.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.061
Emergency dentist
appointment.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.831
Now I'm told she told
her manager she had the flu.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.466
I'm a trusting guy,
but, uh...

11:06.499 --> 11:08.468
I just wish
Debbie Brown had been there.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.303
We would have caught this.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.042
Yes.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.877
I'll be sure someone
returns your call.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.212
I'm so sorry.
Bye.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.148
Hello. I'm looking
for Michael Scott.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.184
(Michael)
Mrs. Allen is our
most important client.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.219
Because every client

11:26.253 --> 11:28.355
is our most important client.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.792
Even though she's a pretty
unimportant client, really.

11:31.825 --> 11:35.462
And so, with the eyes
of the nation upon us,

11:35.495 --> 11:37.497
I would like to say

11:37.530 --> 11:39.332
that Dunder-Mifflin
truly regrets

11:39.366 --> 11:41.969
this unfortunate incident.

11:42.002 --> 11:45.138
And, as a gesture
of gratitude

11:45.172 --> 11:48.742
for your continued loyalty,
Mrs. Allen,

11:48.776 --> 11:52.279
I would like to present you
with this novelty check

11:52.312 --> 11:56.416
for six months of free paper,
or 25 reams,

11:56.449 --> 11:58.185
whichever comes first.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.321
You look good in this.

12:01.354 --> 12:06.126
So...let us consider
this matter ended.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.361
Well, it isn't ended.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.164
I'm--I'm very angry.
I could have lost business.

12:11.198 --> 12:14.301
I know.
I know you're angry.

12:14.334 --> 12:17.170
And we are truly,
truly sorry.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.773
I don't accept
your apology.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.541
The watermark was obscene
and horrifying.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.410
Well...

12:23.443 --> 12:25.512
we are extremely sorry.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.180
I don't accept.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.321
I'll be with you in a moment.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.356
Alright.

12:39.359 --> 12:42.996
Who was that guy she was talking
to... at here locker?

12:43.030 --> 12:45.265
Not important. Because you're
not dating her.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.267
Because it's a felony.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.336
But who was that guy?

12:49.369 --> 12:52.372
Probably another high school
student.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.845
The issue with the watermark is
very serious.

12:57.878 --> 12:58.778
Absolutely.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.547
We teach our students that
character counts.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.349
And you should.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.552
You don't teach it well enough.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.587
One of your students is a bitch.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.291
Andy is having a real rough day
today.

13:11.324 --> 13:14.094
I wanna take out an ad in your
school yearbook.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.462
Who page, two words.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.097
Good luck.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.566
That's not what
I had in mind.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.568
Ask where he's from.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.603
Where are you from?

13:23.636 --> 13:25.338
Ohio? That's nice.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.340
So what do you want?

13:27.374 --> 13:29.509
He's upset
about the watermark.

13:29.542 --> 13:30.477
Ok, great.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.245
Now tell him that
it was an unfortunate error,

13:32.279 --> 13:34.347
and we're doing everything
we can do to fix it,

13:34.381 --> 13:35.582
and that you're sorry.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.885
It was an unfortunate error.
We're fixing it.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.152
And you already got
your money back--

13:39.186 --> 13:40.587
And you're sorry.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.155
And the company
has already apologized,

13:42.189 --> 13:45.092
so you can take that
apology or not.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.562
I think he had
Tourette's or something.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.866
We are going to do
everything humanly possible

13:52.900 --> 13:55.135
to ensure that this
never happens again.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.870
Well, it doesn't help.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.405
Because it already
happened to me.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.874
The watermark--
it's a one-time thing.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.943
I don't care.
It was disgusting!

14:02.976 --> 14:04.344
Cartoon characters
having sex?

14:04.377 --> 14:08.115
May I point out that the sex
appeared to be consensual.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.150
Both animals were smiling.
Okay.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.651
I grew up on a farm.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.288
I have seen animals having sex
in every position imaginable.

14:15.322 --> 14:18.291
Goat on chicken,
chicken on goat.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.327
Couple of chickens
doing a goat.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.129
Couple of pigs watching.

14:22.162 --> 14:25.232
Whoever drew this
got it exactly right.

14:25.265 --> 14:28.268
What...can I do
for you?

14:28.301 --> 14:31.204
For starters,
I think that you should resign.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.672
Well...
[exhales]

14:32.705 --> 14:34.507
Okay. Well...

14:34.541 --> 14:37.077
Um, wasn't really
my fault.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.146
The guys
at the paper mill--
You're the head--

14:39.179 --> 14:40.247
It was a guy at the paper mills.
No, no, no.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.681
You're the head
of the company!

14:41.714 --> 14:44.217
I'm the head of the company?
Yes, and that makes it your
responsibility--

14:44.251 --> 14:45.352
No, I'm a regional
manager.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.353
(Mrs. Allen)
And you should
lose your job!

14:46.386 --> 14:48.488
Okay, this is insane.
You can get out of here.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.423
Get out!
That's insane.
Fine.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.125
We'll give this to somebody
who will appreciate it.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.226
(Dwight)
It's nontransferable.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.527
Doesn't matter.
Out, please!

14:54.561 --> 14:56.129
I'm calling
the Better Business Bureau.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.531
Yeah, well, I'm calling
the Ungrateful Bee-otch Hotline!

15:02.002 --> 15:03.636
Did you get all that?

15:03.670 --> 15:05.238
Everything.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.211
We gotta do something.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.312
[exhales]

15:12.345 --> 15:14.147
This is spinning
out of control, Pam.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.248
This is just not--

15:15.282 --> 15:17.184
It's just
The Scranton Times.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.019
No, then Newsweek
picks it up.

15:19.052 --> 15:21.354
And then CNN
does a story about it.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.356
And then...YouTube
gets a hold of it.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.457
You know what?

15:24.491 --> 15:26.960
I really think the whole thing
is just gonna blow over

15:26.994 --> 15:28.395
in, like, a week or two.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.698
You're right.
It will blow over.

15:33.566 --> 15:37.670
But it's not
going to take...

15:37.704 --> 15:39.406
a week or two.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.574
Do you know what
this is for?

15:41.608 --> 15:43.643
Yes.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.246
(Pam)
Michael likes me
to run the camera

15:46.279 --> 15:48.148
when he makes
his apology videos.

15:48.181 --> 15:51.384
He says he needs
a woman's touch.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.430
Okay, I think that's good.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.166
(Michael)
"Hello, I am Michael Scott,

16:06.199 --> 16:08.368
"Regional Manager
of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton.

16:08.401 --> 16:11.704
"By now, you are probably
sick of hearing about

16:11.738 --> 16:15.242
"Dunder-Mifflin and our
embarrassing watermark boner.

16:15.275 --> 16:18.711
"Let me tell you something.
Something from the heart.

16:18.745 --> 16:22.282
"I am not leaving
this office.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.117
"It will take a SWAT team

16:24.151 --> 16:26.119
"to remove me
from this office,

16:26.153 --> 16:28.321
and maybe not even that."

16:28.355 --> 16:30.057
Uh, you could never
withstand a SWAT team.

16:30.090 --> 16:33.193
That's how devoted I am
to this job.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.261
I'm just saying.
I know.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.229
They would flank you,
throw in a concussion grenade.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.131
I understand that,
Dwight.
You'd be on the ground--

16:38.165 --> 16:39.466
Do you think
you're taking it a little...

16:39.499 --> 16:40.600
blind, deaf, dumb.

16:40.633 --> 16:41.601
literally, Dwight?

16:41.634 --> 16:42.735
And now we're wasting tape.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.704
I'm gonna have
to cut this all out.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.239
Can you say "cut"...
Cut.

16:46.273 --> 16:47.540
So I know where to--
Cut.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.109
I'm asking Pam
to do it, please.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.144
Cut.
Okay, ready?

16:51.178 --> 16:54.214
Kevin, what's four
plus seven?

16:54.247 --> 16:56.283
Eleven.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.684
Yeah, well,
you didn't know that

16:57.717 --> 17:00.420
when you filled out
this payroll form.

17:00.453 --> 17:03.390
Yeah, well, at least I didn't
suck at customer relations.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.292
Ooh, yes!

17:05.325 --> 17:06.293
Facial!

17:06.326 --> 17:07.294
Yes.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.129
You two are apes.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.764
I expect you to apologize
for that, Angela.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.633
I'm sorry.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.136
That you're both
morons.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.604
But you still said,
"I'm sorry."

17:17.637 --> 17:19.239
I called you morons.
Still said it.

17:19.272 --> 17:20.807
Still said it,
so...

17:29.282 --> 17:31.284
Five, four, three.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.586
"There is no way

17:33.620 --> 17:35.522
"I will resign.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.823
"It wouldn't be fair.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.658
"Not to the good workers
I work with,

17:38.691 --> 17:41.328
"not to my clients,

17:41.361 --> 17:43.363
"and especially not to me.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.864
"Let's not forget

17:44.897 --> 17:49.202
"who this whole resigning
business is about, anyway.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.838
"If I could leave you
with one thought,

17:51.871 --> 17:54.341
"remember...it wasn't me.

17:54.374 --> 17:57.344
"They're trying to make me
an escape goat.

17:57.377 --> 18:00.680
"If I am fired,
I swear to God

18:00.713 --> 18:04.451
"that every single piece
of copier paper in this town

18:04.484 --> 18:08.355
"is going to have
the F-word on it.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.590
The F-word."

18:10.623 --> 18:13.393
You have one day.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.695
(Pam)
One day for what?

18:15.728 --> 18:18.431
That's--they always
give an ultimatum.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.300
Okay.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.601
(Michael)
Good? Cut.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.603
Cut.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.139
That was your best
apology video ever.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.607
I thought so too.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.709
Got a farewell card
for Debbie Brown.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.311
I thought maybe
you'd like to sign it.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.213
Maybe throw a couple
of bucks in there for her.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.581
She's got some children.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.416
(Creed)
I feel terrible
about Debbie Brown.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.385
She got fired
because of Dwight.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.388
So I thought I'd pass around
a good-bye card.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.523
Maybe everyone could put in
a couple of bucks

18:43.556 --> 18:46.293
to help her through
these difficult times.

18:46.326 --> 18:49.662
Why do bad things always happen
to the good people?

18:51.331 --> 18:53.900
It's tragic.
Just tragic.

18:58.871 --> 18:59.939
You want music?

18:59.972 --> 19:02.242
I don't care.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.910
Come on, man.
Just give it a couple days.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.745
I think
you'll be all right.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.247
Yeah.

19:11.951 --> 19:14.421
* A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh

19:14.454 --> 19:16.256
* A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh

19:16.289 --> 19:18.458
* A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh

19:18.491 --> 19:20.527
* A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh

19:20.560 --> 19:21.761
You know what?
I-I don't--

19:21.794 --> 19:23.430
[louder]
* A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh

19:23.463 --> 19:25.432
* A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh

19:25.465 --> 19:27.267
* A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh

19:27.300 --> 19:28.568
* A-wimoweh

19:28.601 --> 19:32.539
* Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh *

19:32.572 --> 19:35.442
* Ree um bum bum-a hey
* A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh

19:35.475 --> 19:36.443
* A-wimoweh

19:36.476 --> 19:39.779
* Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh,
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh *

19:39.812 --> 19:43.883
* Ree um bum bum-a hey
* A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh *

19:43.916 --> 19:53.960
Sweet.

19:53.960 --> 19:59.766
Sweet.

19:59.799 --> 20:00.833
Pam?

20:00.867 --> 20:03.303
Hey, Dwight.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.405
You look
really nice today.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.340
Psh!
I look like an idiot.

20:08.475 --> 20:09.976
Hey, Karen.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.444
Hey, Dwight.
Lookin' sharp.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.380
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm...

20:13.413 --> 20:15.515
your boyfriend,
Jim Halpert.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.417
Hey, Karen,

20:17.450 --> 20:18.618
wanna get together later

20:18.651 --> 20:21.854
and have sexual intercourse,
'cause you're my girlfriend?

20:21.888 --> 20:23.423
Do you?
No.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.258
Okay.
I'm good.
Thanks.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.433
Look at that.

20:33.466 --> 20:34.734
I'm Jim Halpert.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.705
Spot on.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.607
Blah, blah,
a little comment.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.641
Yeah.
