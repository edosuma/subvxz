WEBVTT

00:00.009 --> 00:02.009
Previously on "Bates Motel"...

00:02.129 --> 00:03.294
The only reason that you are here

00:03.414 --> 00:04.942
is because I don't know how to help you.

00:05.062 --> 00:07.005
Stuffing me in here,
I don't forgive you.

00:07.125 --> 00:08.996
I've never been so
disappointed in anyone.

00:09.116 --> 00:10.264
Norman.

00:10.384 --> 00:12.625
By the authority vested in me,

00:12.745 --> 00:15.838
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

00:17.149 --> 00:19.128
Who would do this?

00:19.718 --> 00:21.353
Have you been in therapy before?

00:21.473 --> 00:23.802
How long does this go
on for? Can I just leave?

00:23.922 --> 00:25.522
I'd rather you didn't.

00:27.646 --> 00:30.203
I don't know what happened before.

00:30.323 --> 00:33.228
I just... black out.

00:34.165 --> 00:36.159
But I can't do this anymore.

00:46.110 --> 00:47.719
Are you sure we should
be cleaning this up?

00:47.839 --> 00:49.719
Maybe we should dust
for prints or something.

00:49.839 --> 00:51.648
They wore gloves,
Norma. There's no prints.

00:51.768 --> 00:53.681
They? Who's they?

00:53.801 --> 00:55.594
They, he, she, whoever it was.

00:55.714 --> 00:58.221
Well, did they have to
break my favorite window?

00:58.341 --> 01:00.838
That's mean. That's personal.

01:00.958 --> 01:02.719
What the hell, Alex?
I have been so good.

01:02.839 --> 01:04.050
I've totally kept to myself.

01:04.170 --> 01:06.079
All I've been thinking about is
Norman and getting him better.

01:06.199 --> 01:10.099
I've been busy marrying you. I
haven't had time to piss anyone off.

01:10.839 --> 01:13.145
What if it's Bob Paris again?

01:16.839 --> 01:19.006
- No, it's not Bob.
- How do you know?

01:19.126 --> 01:21.502
Because it's an amateur move.
It's sloppy, it's... it's...

01:21.622 --> 01:24.272
- It's pretty aggressive.
- It's about me.

01:26.058 --> 01:27.839
Why? What did you do?

01:29.509 --> 01:31.059
Nothing. I...

01:32.154 --> 01:34.838
Look, uh, there are all
these people in the drug trade

01:34.958 --> 01:36.838
who got rolled up by the DEA.

01:36.958 --> 01:38.970
I'm just trying to clean
up the loose ends right now,

01:39.090 --> 01:41.090
and... pisses some people off.

01:42.139 --> 01:44.248
Hazards of marrying
a sheriff. I'm sorry.

01:44.368 --> 01:45.006
Are you in danger?

01:45.007 --> 01:46.116
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.583
This is... it's a
nuisance. It's not a threat,

01:49.148 --> 01:53.198
all right? And I'm sorry about the
window. We're gonna get that fixed.

01:54.724 --> 01:56.839
- All right.
- Okay.

02:52.602 --> 02:55.325
I'm just, uh, looking for someone

02:55.445 --> 02:58.838
who can replicate this exactly.

02:59.283 --> 03:01.033
Do you have a window guy?

03:01.267 --> 03:03.838
Not that kind of window guy.

03:05.780 --> 03:08.539
Can I just, um, leave you my info?

03:08.659 --> 03:10.596
You can maybe ask around.

03:10.716 --> 03:13.164
See if anyone might want to help me.

03:13.284 --> 03:14.838
Sure.

03:20.460 --> 03:22.226
My name is Norma Bates.

03:22.346 --> 03:26.838
I run the Bates Motel out on Highway 88,

03:27.055 --> 03:29.839
and, uh, the stained glass
window is not for the motel below.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.475
It's for my home above.

03:31.595 --> 03:33.373
Thank you for all your help.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.719
And so the blackouts

03:54.839 --> 03:58.838
have to be physiological
in some way, I think.

03:59.063 --> 04:02.345
I did have an MRI, which
didn't show anything,

04:02.465 --> 04:05.838
but maybe I should have another one.

04:06.084 --> 04:08.246
I'm not trying to make an excuse. I...

04:08.366 --> 04:10.317
I probably do need to be on medication,

04:10.437 --> 04:13.839
and... and that's something
that I'm willing to try.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.838
Uh, yes, I... I obviously made a mistake

04:20.958 --> 04:24.599
when I said that my mother kills people.

04:25.072 --> 04:27.719
My mother and I have a very typical

04:27.839 --> 04:30.839
teenage boy/mother
relationship, I think.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.044
How do you like the food here?

04:34.755 --> 04:37.838
Uh, food is all right.

04:38.865 --> 04:40.838
Not as good as at home.

04:40.958 --> 04:43.328
Is your mother a good cook?

04:43.647 --> 04:45.067
Oh, yes.

04:45.577 --> 04:48.719
Oh, boy, is she the absolute best.

04:50.311 --> 04:54.111
Why did you use the word "typical"
to describe your relationship?

04:55.839 --> 04:58.651
Oh, well, I think I just meant normal.

05:00.839 --> 05:04.486
Is that important to you, having
your relationship described as normal?

05:04.606 --> 05:09.246
No, no, I just don't
think that we are abnormal.

05:10.001 --> 05:12.839
Yes, we're close, but we had to be.

05:15.292 --> 05:17.342
You know my father died, right?

05:18.592 --> 05:20.838
I do. Were you two close?

05:20.958 --> 05:22.198
No.

05:23.601 --> 05:26.101
Yeah, yeah, I... I mean, I didn't, uh...

05:28.139 --> 05:31.072
He was my father. I loved him... lots,

05:31.192 --> 05:34.372
but he... he was just always at work.

05:36.101 --> 05:37.838
And when he died,

05:38.403 --> 05:41.572
there just wasn't anyone
else for my mother to lean on,

05:41.692 --> 05:44.019
and so it was very important

05:44.139 --> 05:46.839
that she knew she could rely on me.

05:50.082 --> 05:51.838
Was that hard for you?

05:52.530 --> 05:55.454
No. Gosh, no. It...
it was never a burden.

05:55.574 --> 05:57.838
She is my mother,

05:57.958 --> 06:02.449
and... and my mother's an
incredibly special person.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.715
She can be so hopeful,

06:05.835 --> 06:08.838
so... so very optimistic

06:08.958 --> 06:11.356
that people will be
good to her, and just...

06:11.784 --> 06:13.984
sometimes they can take advantage.

06:18.418 --> 06:20.580
Sorry, I just, um...

06:21.154 --> 06:24.838
I... I just don't
like leaving her alone.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.154
I understand being
worried about her, but...

06:29.274 --> 06:31.719
is it possible that your mother is happy

06:31.839 --> 06:35.039
that you're taking this
time to think about yourself?

06:36.682 --> 06:38.239
Maybe.

06:39.701 --> 06:41.548
Probably, yes,

06:41.668 --> 06:45.145
but I... still just can't stand

06:45.265 --> 06:48.297
that I've added to the list
of things that make her suffer.

07:23.131 --> 07:24.832
Welcome home.

07:24.952 --> 07:27.836
I thought I'd at least
get a parade or something.

07:27.956 --> 07:31.092
Yeah, well, the, uh, the
marching band is in the back.

07:48.646 --> 07:50.838
I'm so happy to be home,

07:51.647 --> 07:54.865
- although I guess not for long, right?
- Well, it's not sold yet,

07:54.985 --> 07:56.938
but we do have a renter interested.

07:57.058 --> 07:58.596
Don't worry about it.

07:58.716 --> 07:59.932
Oh.

08:01.101 --> 08:03.299
One step at a time, baby girl.

08:03.419 --> 08:06.838
Right now we're here.
We're together. We made it.

08:08.038 --> 08:10.120
Come on, I've got some tea on.

08:10.839 --> 08:12.976
- Tea, Dylan?
- Tea?

08:13.604 --> 08:15.079
Yeah.

08:18.469 --> 08:21.154
So, uh, what time do
you need me tomorrow?

08:21.274 --> 08:24.274
Uh, Chris will let you
know in the morning.

08:27.548 --> 08:30.608
Oh, um, I was just wondering

08:30.728 --> 08:32.698
if it would be possible

08:32.818 --> 08:34.717
for me to make a phone call.

08:35.003 --> 08:36.753
I know I need permission.

08:37.024 --> 08:39.774
- Who do you want to call?
- My friend Emma.

08:41.570 --> 08:46.273
She's got CF, and, uh, has just
had a lung transplant, so...

08:47.573 --> 08:50.223
Of course. I'll add
your name to the list.

08:57.636 --> 09:01.436
Hello, it's Norma Bates. Leave a
message, and I'll call you back.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.765
Hi, it's me.

09:04.885 --> 09:06.177
Um...

09:08.528 --> 09:09.790
I, uh...

09:09.910 --> 09:13.911
I just wanted to say that
I hope you're doing okay

09:14.318 --> 09:16.273
getting through everything,

09:17.164 --> 09:18.437
and...

09:18.557 --> 09:20.197
and I'm sorry.

09:23.516 --> 09:26.511
I think you were right a-about...

09:27.677 --> 09:30.970
I've been confused
about things and, uh...

09:31.771 --> 09:34.621
But I'm really working
hard to get better now.

09:35.076 --> 09:37.273
I really think I can do it.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.375
I miss you very much,

09:46.640 --> 09:48.608
and I love you.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.236
I know I still look like her,

10:06.761 --> 10:08.961
but I don't feel like her anymore.

10:10.237 --> 10:11.837
What do you feel like?

10:23.074 --> 10:24.500
- I'm sorry. You okay?
- It's okay.

10:24.620 --> 10:26.248
No, it's just a little sore.

10:30.544 --> 10:32.117
I think that's my
dad's not-so-subtle way

10:32.237 --> 10:34.405
of telling me to get back into bed.

10:38.061 --> 10:40.117
You want me to help you with those?

10:40.829 --> 10:43.814
Are you... are you that
desperate to see me naked?

10:43.934 --> 10:45.131
Maybe.

10:46.633 --> 10:48.933
Well, um, you're gonna have to wait.

10:50.237 --> 10:53.339
Like the doctor said, four to six weeks.

10:54.422 --> 10:57.572
Wait, you... you asked
him when we could...

10:58.615 --> 11:01.117
I'll, uh... I'll put it in my phone.

11:01.237 --> 11:03.565
Okay. Get out.

11:19.635 --> 11:20.652
Hello?

11:20.772 --> 11:22.870
- Dr. Edwards?
- Speaking.

11:22.990 --> 11:25.496
This is Mac Dixon over
at the Pineview Station.

11:25.616 --> 11:27.663
I just wanted to follow
up about the Bates boy.

11:27.783 --> 11:30.404
Yes, yes, thank you. Any news?

11:30.524 --> 11:32.236
Yeah.

11:32.899 --> 11:35.237
We looked into all that. Uh...

11:35.479 --> 11:38.520
My opinion is the, uh,
claim made by your patient

11:38.640 --> 11:41.192
is not grounded in any kind of reality.

11:41.312 --> 11:43.987
His mother, uh, Norma
Bates, has no record.

11:44.107 --> 11:46.628
The Bradley Martin
girl, that was a suicide.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.651
And, uh, that teacher,
uh, Blaire Watson,

11:49.771 --> 11:51.316
she was murdered, knife to the throat,

11:51.436 --> 11:54.978
but there's a man doing 20
years in County for that.

11:55.388 --> 11:58.435
Now, uh, Audrey Decody,

11:58.816 --> 12:00.932
uh, well, we... We
haven't located her yet,

12:01.052 --> 12:03.677
but unless you've got
new information, uh,

12:03.797 --> 12:06.692
I'm inclined to label it a false alarm.

12:07.275 --> 12:09.316
Actually, Norman denies the claim now.

12:09.436 --> 12:10.972
Well, there you go.

12:11.317 --> 12:12.717
You take care now.

12:23.515 --> 12:26.435
- She's asleep.
- Good. She needs it.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.603
You're not gonna join us for dinner?

12:30.550 --> 12:34.122
No. No, um, not tonight.

12:34.242 --> 12:36.692
Come on, it's Emma's first night home.

12:37.095 --> 12:39.295
Yeah, no, I know. It's just, um...

12:41.380 --> 12:44.830
I got to be in Seattle early
tomorrow for a job interview.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.454
Does this have anything
to do with my daughter

12:49.574 --> 12:52.533
asking you to go with us when we move?

12:53.389 --> 12:55.106
Yeah, well, um...

12:57.773 --> 12:59.023
I'd like to go.

13:00.998 --> 13:02.435
What's the job interview?

13:03.447 --> 13:07.792
It's a... it's an assistant manager
position at a... a hops distributor.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.461
You know, I think it's
something that I'd be good at.

13:09.581 --> 13:12.699
I mean, it's got a lot of the
same kind of work and stuff

13:12.819 --> 13:16.435
- that I was doing with the...
- The marijuana trade?

13:17.089 --> 13:19.570
Unfortunately, I can't
put that on a resume.

13:19.690 --> 13:20.889
Lie.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.363
Everybody does it.

13:22.483 --> 13:24.081
I thought I was supposed
to be trying to go legit.

13:24.201 --> 13:26.387
Yeah, but sometimes to do that,

13:26.507 --> 13:29.107
you've got to get
creative with the past.

13:29.599 --> 13:33.223
I'll tell you what, put down that
you've worked at Artful Artifacts.

13:33.343 --> 13:35.898
Firm handshake, look them in the eye.

13:36.363 --> 13:37.636
And lie.

13:48.908 --> 13:50.100
Yes?

13:50.220 --> 13:52.861
I heard you have a
stained glass problem.

13:53.088 --> 13:55.606
I'm here from Sam's Hardware.

13:55.971 --> 13:57.435
Um...

13:58.620 --> 14:00.450
You do stained glass?

14:00.887 --> 14:05.435
Well, my primary material is iron,

14:05.997 --> 14:09.595
but I don't have much
occasion to work with glass.

14:09.715 --> 14:12.973
And people around here don't put much
of a premium on that kind of work.

14:13.093 --> 14:15.196
Not that I'm only
motivated by economics.

14:15.316 --> 14:18.894
It's just that I like to
make art that's wanted.

14:21.946 --> 14:23.846
May I see the piece, please?

14:24.356 --> 14:28.011
- Um, yeah, come on in.
- Thank you.

14:31.563 --> 14:33.784
It's, uh, it's back here.

14:36.853 --> 14:38.435
Oh.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.650
- I've always admired a Queen Anne.
- The house?

14:42.770 --> 14:46.223
Very popular at the
turn of the 20th century.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.916
That's when they invented the jigsaw,

14:49.171 --> 14:52.218
let people make fine wooden
detail at a fraction of the cost.

14:52.338 --> 14:54.741
Oh, I never knew that.
I love this style.

14:54.861 --> 14:57.153
I know it's not very
fashionable these days.

14:57.618 --> 14:59.016
I didn't get your name.

14:59.136 --> 15:02.435
Hogan, Char... Chick...
People call me Chick.

15:03.125 --> 15:05.075
Chick? I'm Norma.

15:05.421 --> 15:06.921
Yeah, it's this way.

15:12.271 --> 15:14.087
Oh, now, that is a shame.

15:14.207 --> 15:15.470
We had a break-in.

15:15.590 --> 15:18.152
Of course they didn't break
any of the boring windows.

15:18.272 --> 15:20.448
Ugh, unnecessarily mean.

15:23.117 --> 15:26.117
I have a picture here so
you can see the pattern.

15:27.325 --> 15:28.836
Mm.

15:29.863 --> 15:31.242
Oh, careful.

15:31.362 --> 15:34.578
Well, you learn exactly
how much an edge can take

15:34.698 --> 15:36.435
before it'll cut you.

15:36.555 --> 15:40.353
I'm not in the interest
of getting myself hurt.

15:40.672 --> 15:43.937
Well, if you don't mind me
asking, what happened to you?

15:44.240 --> 15:47.643
N... no, I don't mind.
There was a dog in the road,

15:47.763 --> 15:50.939
and I swerved off the
road to avoid killing it.

15:51.230 --> 15:53.107
Flipped the car three times.

15:53.544 --> 15:56.436
When I woke up, the
dog was licking my face.

15:58.674 --> 16:00.312
That's awful.

16:01.405 --> 16:02.798
Yeah, well,

16:03.663 --> 16:06.744
I suppose we all have
those moments in life

16:07.217 --> 16:10.279
where everything changes in a second.

16:16.653 --> 16:18.753
So do you think you can help me?

16:20.026 --> 16:23.512
I'd like very much to help
you, I think I can, yes.

16:28.436 --> 16:30.325
So did you manage many employees

16:30.445 --> 16:33.686
at, uh, Artful Artifacts?

16:34.435 --> 16:37.435
Uh... uh... not exactly.

16:37.555 --> 16:39.959
No, it's a, um... That's a...

16:40.079 --> 16:41.498
It's a pretty small store.

16:41.618 --> 16:44.501
So this leadership experience, uh...

16:46.649 --> 16:48.930
Look, that... Th... that
paper's not gonna tell you

16:49.050 --> 16:51.071
why I can do this job.

16:53.487 --> 16:55.651
You see, when I first
moved to White Pine Bay,

16:55.652 --> 16:57.756
there weren't a lot of
traditional jobs, you know,

16:57.876 --> 17:01.290
but there was one main industry,

17:01.882 --> 17:03.652
marijuana.

17:06.940 --> 17:09.531
We, uh... we had a group

17:09.652 --> 17:11.651
of about 20 artisanal growers

17:11.771 --> 17:14.226
who... who processed through us,
and then we distributed their product

17:14.346 --> 17:17.407
all across the country. Our...
our sales model was actually

17:17.528 --> 17:18.651
really similar to yours.

17:19.125 --> 17:22.531
But th... the point is, is that
I moved from a security position

17:22.652 --> 17:26.651
to an office in less than a year.

17:26.982 --> 17:29.593
That's impressive. Why
isn't it on your resume?

17:29.713 --> 17:32.372
Look, Vic, I... I get it, okay?

17:32.492 --> 17:34.651
I'm a questionable candidate,

17:35.569 --> 17:36.651
but I'm qualified.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.577
All right, you have... you have
no reason to take a chance on me,

17:39.697 --> 17:42.447
but if you do, I promise
I won't disappoint.

17:53.378 --> 17:55.751
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:58.559 --> 18:01.652
So last night you,
um... You crossed a line.

18:02.287 --> 18:04.866
Okay, trashed my house,
and you scared my wife.

18:04.986 --> 18:07.305
Okay, wait, but last night I was
at the Lights of Winter Festival.

18:07.425 --> 18:09.301
- You saw me there.
- Stop it, stop it. Stop it.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.533
Sorry, I don't know what
you're talking about.

18:10.653 --> 18:13.037
I don't have the damn
key. Stay out of our house.

18:20.131 --> 18:23.532
Remember when you asked
if the DEA was onto you?

18:23.652 --> 18:25.393
Well, they called me to ask if I knew...

18:25.513 --> 18:27.108
If I knew you personally

18:27.228 --> 18:30.106
or if I had any knowledge
of you laundering money.

18:30.226 --> 18:32.841
They're sniffing around, fishing. I
don't think they have anything on you,

18:32.961 --> 18:34.361
but just be aware.

18:37.529 --> 18:39.479
I don't want to go to prison.

18:41.067 --> 18:43.068
Are you sure that you
don't have that key?

18:43.188 --> 18:44.834
Yeah, I'm sure.

18:46.706 --> 18:48.361
And leave Norma and
her house alone, okay?

18:48.481 --> 18:50.651
I think you understand me.

19:05.804 --> 19:07.261
Julian.

19:08.008 --> 19:10.819
Julian, I'm so glad to see
you. I wasn't sure where they...

19:10.939 --> 19:14.532
It is believed that no
two images of the zebras

19:14.652 --> 19:17.532
have the same pattern in their stripes.

19:17.652 --> 19:20.532
Still, as recognizable as zebras are,

19:20.652 --> 19:23.452
it's becoming harder
and harder to spot them.

19:27.823 --> 19:29.873
I'm sorry they did this to you.

19:58.793 --> 20:00.154
Norman?

20:10.533 --> 20:12.651
- Oh, Mom. Ahh.
- Oh!

20:14.246 --> 20:15.958
Oh, Norman.

20:16.652 --> 20:18.532
Oh, sweetheart.

20:23.967 --> 20:26.651
It's very peaceful here, Norman.

20:27.179 --> 20:29.364
Yes, I suppose so.

20:31.132 --> 20:34.841
I really appreciate your message.
I hope it's okay that I came.

20:35.460 --> 20:37.652
It's more than okay, Mother.

20:40.774 --> 20:43.153
How are things going in therapy?

20:46.702 --> 20:49.153
What is it, sweetheart?

20:49.806 --> 20:53.528
It's just Dr. Edwards wants to
know all these personal things.

20:53.648 --> 20:55.153
Oh, well, that's his job, isn't it?

20:55.273 --> 20:56.986
To ask about you, find out who you are?

20:57.106 --> 20:58.741
I know, but it...

21:00.362 --> 21:04.118
I just don't want to betray
your confidence, Mother.

21:05.652 --> 21:07.796
What are you worried about saying?

21:11.058 --> 21:13.651
He asked about Dad.

21:13.771 --> 21:17.651
He asked if we were close,
and I accidentally said no.

21:19.947 --> 21:22.651
It's not easy losing your
father at such a young age.

21:22.771 --> 21:24.651
You know, you never had
the time to get to know him.

21:24.771 --> 21:27.651
No, I did get to know him.

21:28.259 --> 21:30.651
He was not a very nice man.

21:31.081 --> 21:33.441
- Does it matter?
- Dr. Edwards would probably think so.

21:33.561 --> 21:37.651
Dr. Edwards' job is to make
you feel better, not worse.

21:38.423 --> 21:42.159
You know, you don't need to remember
the... the hurtful things, Norman.

21:42.732 --> 21:46.651
Your father is dead.
He's dust. He's nothing.

21:47.568 --> 21:49.651
You understand?

21:49.963 --> 21:51.651
I understand.

21:56.205 --> 21:59.242
People here... They can be so crazy.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.957
Show the doctor that
you're feeling better,

22:04.077 --> 22:06.727
and then we can get
you out of here, okay?

22:07.616 --> 22:09.115
Okay.

22:10.071 --> 22:11.471
I love you, honey.

22:12.283 --> 22:13.664
I love you too.

22:32.221 --> 22:34.222
Oh, Chick.

22:34.832 --> 22:37.255
- Hi, let me help you.
- No, no!

22:38.102 --> 22:40.649
It's important for my
sense of self that I do it.

22:40.769 --> 22:42.223
Okay.

22:43.835 --> 22:46.103
You can't possibly be done with it.

22:46.223 --> 22:48.469
No, no, I had a... you know,

22:48.589 --> 22:51.357
a moment of clarity, and
I wanted to run it by you

22:51.477 --> 22:53.900
- before I wasted any more time.
- Oh, well, come sit down.

22:54.701 --> 22:58.222
So... the best version...

22:59.595 --> 23:01.104
The best version of your window

23:01.224 --> 23:04.789
is not for me to just
recreate somebody else's work.

23:04.909 --> 23:07.271
It's for me to be inspired by that work

23:07.391 --> 23:09.867
and then create something else

23:09.987 --> 23:13.443
that has its own life and purpose

23:13.563 --> 23:17.266
and integrity and...
and reason for being.

23:18.548 --> 23:20.342
So take a look at that.

23:25.312 --> 23:26.760
You came up with this?

23:26.880 --> 23:30.645
Yeah, see, the light in your
house, it narrows, right?

23:31.148 --> 23:34.210
So the... the light will
bleed through this design

23:34.330 --> 23:35.986
a little more kindly.

23:36.106 --> 23:39.321
You know, I've never had someone
create something for me before.

23:42.638 --> 23:44.559
This is beautiful.

23:44.896 --> 23:46.234
Huh.

23:46.462 --> 23:48.867
You know, the funny thing is, uh,

23:48.987 --> 23:51.867
yesterday when I was
looking at your photos,

23:51.987 --> 23:55.588
something in my brain just went click.

23:56.371 --> 23:59.584
I know your son, Dylan.

23:59.704 --> 24:01.423
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

24:01.705 --> 24:04.177
- Oh, it's a small world.
- Yeah, we're neighbors.

24:04.297 --> 24:05.706
- No kidding?
- Loosely.

24:05.826 --> 24:07.867
I thought he had a team of
people helping him out there.

24:07.987 --> 24:12.114
Was it... the guy with the
bloodshot eyes, what was his name?

24:12.341 --> 24:14.564
- Gunner.
- Yeah, Gunner.

24:15.466 --> 24:17.184
And then, uh...

24:17.776 --> 24:19.023
Caleb.

24:20.170 --> 24:21.430
Hm.

24:21.767 --> 24:24.986
That guy seemed like he
knew what he was doing.

24:25.239 --> 24:26.986
And then he split.

24:27.443 --> 24:30.993
Yeah, well, my brother hasn't
always been the most reliable.

24:32.764 --> 24:33.986
Huh.

24:34.106 --> 24:36.863
That was your... your brother?

24:42.521 --> 24:44.439
That explains a lot.

24:49.214 --> 24:51.476
I, you know, I'm sorry,
I hate to rush off,

24:51.596 --> 24:54.868
but I just realized I forgot
something in the... in the oven.

24:54.988 --> 24:57.238
No, no, no, rush... rush off.

24:57.358 --> 24:59.020
Rush on.

24:59.421 --> 25:01.867
Okay, um, but I... It's beautiful.

25:01.987 --> 25:04.752
- Love it. All right.
- Oh, thanks.

25:04.872 --> 25:07.155
- I'll be seeing you, Norma.
- Yeah.

25:11.378 --> 25:12.501
Huh.

25:12.621 --> 25:16.867
So in group this morning,
I offered some advice...

25:16.987 --> 25:20.152
Well, support, I guess, to Lisa,

25:20.398 --> 25:22.556
and I really understood
what she was saying,

25:22.676 --> 25:24.626
and it just made me feel more connected.

25:24.746 --> 25:27.867
So I'm just feeling really positive,

25:27.987 --> 25:30.739
I guess, in a really good mood.

25:31.549 --> 25:33.321
Why do you think that is?

25:33.441 --> 25:37.815
Uh, oh, well, it was wonderful
to see my mother yesterday.

25:39.691 --> 25:41.986
Did you ask her to come and visit?

25:42.106 --> 25:43.379
No.

25:43.580 --> 25:45.986
No, actually, it was unexpected.

25:46.720 --> 25:51.247
Uh, yes, I was not exactly kind
to her the last time she came here.

25:51.367 --> 25:53.987
I was angry, and I took it out on her,

25:54.107 --> 25:57.307
but she was actually
just worried about me.

25:57.427 --> 26:01.696
She... she wanted me to get
help, and... and now that I am,

26:01.816 --> 26:04.987
we're both feeling
really hopeful, I think.

26:07.117 --> 26:08.986
Norman... I...

26:09.385 --> 26:11.683
I want to ask you a question

26:11.803 --> 26:14.703
that I think you might
find confusing at first.

26:16.729 --> 26:17.866
Okay.

26:19.286 --> 26:22.286
Is it possible your mother
wasn't here yesterday?

26:24.576 --> 26:25.867
What?

26:25.987 --> 26:27.987
Just consider, Norman.
That's all I'm asking.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.421
You're... you're asking me to consider

26:31.541 --> 26:33.320
that I made up my mother being here?

26:33.440 --> 26:35.186
No, not that you made it up,

26:35.306 --> 26:37.998
but that it didn't
happen like how it felt.

26:38.118 --> 26:42.986
The... no, the truth is that I
think she came because I called her.

26:43.267 --> 26:46.744
I know you called her, Norman,
and I'm not angry about it.

26:46.864 --> 26:49.987
- You checked up on me?
- You know that you're monitored.

26:50.107 --> 26:52.403
It's part of the process of being here.

26:52.523 --> 26:54.312
We checked the number of
the person being called.

26:54.432 --> 26:56.499
It was your mother's cell number.

26:56.619 --> 26:59.443
Yes, well, okay. Well,
then, if I am monitored,

26:59.563 --> 27:02.154
then I think you should
know that my mother was here.

27:02.274 --> 27:05.718
I mean, we just went out
for a walk in the grounds.

27:05.838 --> 27:08.467
It's not like we were hiding.

27:12.853 --> 27:14.401
What?

27:14.521 --> 27:17.092
That's how I know she wasn't here.

27:17.212 --> 27:18.605
I get an email every day

27:18.725 --> 27:20.577
with a list of all the
visitors my patients see.

27:20.697 --> 27:23.681
- She wasn't on it.
- Then, she just didn't check in

27:23.801 --> 27:26.867
My mother can be very obstinate
when it comes to rules.

27:26.987 --> 27:28.646
Norman, listen to me.

27:29.356 --> 27:33.577
People will search for comfort
in an unknown environment.

27:33.697 --> 27:35.867
We can miss people so
much that it feels like

27:35.987 --> 27:37.154
they're with us even when they're not.

27:37.274 --> 27:39.656
But I actually felt her.

27:39.864 --> 27:43.129
She held me, okay? It
was her laugh, her voice.

27:43.249 --> 27:46.075
- I know it felt incredibly real.
- It was real.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.987
Tell me what you talked about.

27:53.831 --> 27:55.170
No.

27:55.987 --> 27:57.402
No, actually, I'm...

27:57.522 --> 27:59.867
I'm not gonna do that
because you think I'm crazy.

27:59.987 --> 28:01.196
No, I don't think you're crazy.

28:01.316 --> 28:04.986
Okay, listen, it's your job to make
me feel better, not worse, okay?

28:05.106 --> 28:07.868
She told me that you would do
this. She... she told me that.

28:07.988 --> 28:09.867
Wait, Norman. Norman. Norman.

28:09.987 --> 28:11.141
- Let me out.
- Please, just stay with me.

28:11.261 --> 28:13.311
Let me out!

28:13.431 --> 28:16.986
Let me out! Hey, help!

28:17.185 --> 28:18.705
Help! Somebody help!

28:18.825 --> 28:19.987
Norman.

28:19.988 --> 28:22.987
Hey. Breathe, Norman.

28:23.595 --> 28:25.303
Breathe, Norman.

28:25.987 --> 28:27.240
Breathe.

28:27.477 --> 28:29.125
Breathe in,

28:29.697 --> 28:30.986
two...

28:31.704 --> 28:32.986
three.

28:34.328 --> 28:35.578
Out...

28:36.106 --> 28:37.367
two...

28:37.986 --> 28:39.241
three...

28:39.887 --> 28:41.154
four.

28:41.617 --> 28:43.993
You have a very soothing voice.

28:48.987 --> 28:53.237
Did they teach you that at medical
school, or were you just born that way?

28:55.687 --> 28:57.187
How do you feel now?

28:59.695 --> 29:01.545
How do you want me to feel?

29:11.480 --> 29:14.989
Do you think you can sit back
down and finish our session?

29:16.278 --> 29:17.671
I could.

29:25.603 --> 29:27.853
Or would you prefer me to lie down?

29:30.636 --> 29:32.488
You can if you like.

29:33.399 --> 29:35.867
It's a very vulnerable position.

29:35.987 --> 29:37.986
I can see the appeal.

29:43.749 --> 29:46.987
But I think I'd rather
look you in the face.

30:09.188 --> 30:11.318
So where were we?

30:12.420 --> 30:14.520
Do you mind if I ask a question?

30:15.764 --> 30:18.055
That's why we're here, isn't it?

30:22.939 --> 30:24.739
What do you think about Norman?

30:27.286 --> 30:31.986
I think he is a very weak, confused boy.

30:32.304 --> 30:34.986
Easy for people to take advantage of.

30:35.704 --> 30:37.274
Is that what you feel I'm doing?

30:37.394 --> 30:41.129
I think you think you're helping,
but that's your ego in action.

30:45.459 --> 30:47.272
If you want to know what's
really wrong with Norman,

30:47.392 --> 30:50.392
you should talk to the
person who knows him best.

30:52.144 --> 30:54.048
And that's you?

30:55.267 --> 30:56.986
Of course it is.

30:57.786 --> 30:59.093
I'm his mother.

31:21.192 --> 31:23.577
Hey there, Sheriff.

31:24.475 --> 31:25.727
What are... You... you can't be here.

31:25.847 --> 31:29.972
- I told the DEA I don't know you.
- I can't believe you got married.

31:32.475 --> 31:35.125
You said you were
never gonna get married.

31:37.891 --> 31:39.662
It's my fault.

31:40.475 --> 31:41.890
I mean, I should know
when a guy says that,

31:42.010 --> 31:44.475
it just means he's
never gonna marry you.

31:48.475 --> 31:49.784
Rebecca...

31:57.475 --> 31:59.894
Oh, no, wait, no... No... no worries.

32:00.014 --> 32:02.070
Oh, I'm being stupid.

32:02.190 --> 32:03.972
Um, go home.

32:04.524 --> 32:06.409
Go to your wife.

32:07.441 --> 32:09.553
Whatever it is she's got,

32:11.675 --> 32:13.514
must be something.

32:23.185 --> 32:24.685
Do you get benefits?

32:25.367 --> 32:26.605
Probably.

32:26.824 --> 32:28.264
That's so sexy.

32:29.424 --> 32:31.223
Yeah, well, I don't, uh...

32:31.343 --> 32:33.993
I don't officially
have the job yet, so...

32:34.482 --> 32:37.553
I can't believe you told
him you were a drug dealer.

32:37.673 --> 32:39.456
Marijuana distribution manager.

32:39.576 --> 32:42.187
I might have kicked you out
of the office at that point.

32:42.507 --> 32:45.220
Yeah, well, I was never
gonna be smart enough

32:45.340 --> 32:46.940
to work for you, so...

32:49.810 --> 32:52.780
Well, I'm glad you told him the truth

32:53.217 --> 32:54.817
and that it went well.

32:55.894 --> 32:57.594
I'm proud of you, Dylan.

33:06.225 --> 33:07.475
W... what's up?

33:11.328 --> 33:15.678
Yesterday my scar didn't really hurt.
I was just embarrassed that I had one.

33:16.953 --> 33:18.874
- Emma.
- No, it's hideous.

33:19.156 --> 33:20.474
No, it's not.

33:20.594 --> 33:22.221
You haven't seen it.

33:22.341 --> 33:23.667
I don't care.

33:23.787 --> 33:26.048
Well, I do. You know,
I hated my oxygen tank,

33:26.168 --> 33:27.635
but that was never a part of me.

33:27.755 --> 33:31.080
This is, and I don't want it
to have power over... over me

33:31.200 --> 33:34.055
or over how I feel
when I'm with you. So...

33:34.265 --> 33:36.474
I just want to get it over with.

33:47.475 --> 33:48.773
It's gross, huh?

34:00.931 --> 34:02.333
Dylan.

34:03.216 --> 34:04.610
You see this one?

34:04.730 --> 34:06.666
That's a, uh... That's a bullet wound

34:06.786 --> 34:09.621
from when that bastard Shelby shot me.

34:10.349 --> 34:13.362
And plowed down by a car.

34:14.871 --> 34:17.355
Yeah, that one... that one
might have been my fault, but...

34:17.475 --> 34:19.474
Don't get hit by any more cars.

34:19.475 --> 34:21.592
- Deal.
- And what about this one?

34:22.563 --> 34:24.938
This one was a, uh...

34:27.681 --> 34:29.474
Tiger shark.

34:29.681 --> 34:31.474
Yeah, a 13-footer.

34:31.858 --> 34:33.078
What?

34:33.475 --> 34:36.857
Sometimes, you know, Chief, a shark,

34:36.976 --> 34:39.911
he looks into you...
Looks into your eyes...

34:40.032 --> 34:41.581
What... why you laughing? This is...

34:41.701 --> 34:43.274
- I'm sorry.
- This is important stuff.

34:43.393 --> 34:45.293
- Why you laughing?
- Okay.

34:46.627 --> 34:48.241
The thing about a shark...

34:48.755 --> 34:50.474
Oh, come on.

34:51.746 --> 34:53.735
How are you gonna survive a
shark attack if you can't listen?

34:53.856 --> 34:56.135
I will blow it up with a gas tank.

34:56.255 --> 34:57.474
I'll be fine.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.783
I hate to tell you, but, uh...

35:00.020 --> 35:01.686
it was an oxygen tank.

35:02.241 --> 35:03.667
Yeah.

35:39.655 --> 35:41.120
When did you sneak in?

35:41.240 --> 35:44.640
Oh, I just heard your playing.
I didn't want you to stop.

35:45.123 --> 35:46.690
Sorry you had to hear
me butcher that song.

35:46.810 --> 35:48.243
It's been in my head all day.

35:48.363 --> 35:49.991
No, I liked it.

35:55.204 --> 35:57.474
I think I found an amazing
guy to fix the window.

35:57.594 --> 35:58.919
- Yeah?
- It might be even more beautiful.

35:59.039 --> 36:00.899
- He's a real artist.
- Oh, that's great.

36:01.019 --> 36:02.294
Yeah.

36:03.737 --> 36:06.696
The break-in might have
been a blessing in disguise.

36:09.741 --> 36:11.809
Have you found out
anything more about it?

36:11.929 --> 36:14.351
Yeah, yeah, actually. It's handled.

36:21.764 --> 36:23.414
Did you kill Bob Paris?

36:34.113 --> 36:36.084
Why? Why did you do it?

36:43.352 --> 36:45.128
I had no choice.

37:20.818 --> 37:21.966
Hey.

37:22.967 --> 37:25.487
I just wanted to check in on you.

37:26.034 --> 37:28.514
- I know it was a big day.
- It was.

37:28.634 --> 37:30.754
I'm sorry I got so emotional.

37:31.300 --> 37:33.106
You know you blacked out, right?

37:33.226 --> 37:35.677
- Headache?
- Yeah.

37:35.797 --> 37:37.253
It's a common side effect.

37:37.373 --> 37:39.528
The nurse can give you some ibuprofen,

37:39.648 --> 37:41.297
and sleep should help.

37:44.818 --> 37:47.524
I never want you to
feel alone here, Norman.

37:48.773 --> 37:50.373
We'll figure this out.

37:54.244 --> 37:56.122
- Okay?
- All right.

37:56.242 --> 37:58.817
All right, see you tomorrow.

38:28.818 --> 38:30.932
It's like you have a sixth sense.

38:31.052 --> 38:33.818
I was just thinking about you.

38:35.622 --> 38:40.038
What do you think about
adding an iron railing

38:40.158 --> 38:42.150
to the front stairs?

38:42.423 --> 38:44.830
- It's in keeping with the era, right?
- Huh.

38:44.950 --> 38:46.413
I have this thing.

38:46.533 --> 38:48.390
It's like my mantra.

38:48.510 --> 38:53.165
I never want to be out
of integrity with myself.

38:53.285 --> 38:55.151
- That's my thing.
- Sure.

38:56.754 --> 38:59.448
You know that story that
I told you about the car

38:59.568 --> 39:02.236
- and the dog licking my face?
- Yeah.

39:02.696 --> 39:04.080
It wasn't true.

39:04.662 --> 39:06.137
Mm.

39:06.257 --> 39:09.007
And I'm... I'm out of
integrity with myself,

39:09.127 --> 39:11.817
and you don't deserve that, Norma.

39:12.635 --> 39:16.724
- It's okay. Don't worry about it.
- We did not meet by accident.

39:17.320 --> 39:20.293
We were both hurt by the same person.

39:22.617 --> 39:25.820
You said that Caleb was your brother.

39:26.712 --> 39:31.181
But when Caleb introduced
himself, it was as Dylan's father.

39:32.465 --> 39:35.961
Nah... I mean, I only put this
all together yesterday, but...

39:36.262 --> 39:39.699
there aren't that many ways
that that adds up, right?

39:41.191 --> 39:44.225
I... you... you're probably confused.

39:44.345 --> 39:46.817
He's... he... Caleb's crazy.

39:46.937 --> 39:48.296
Mm.

39:49.912 --> 39:54.319
Do you want to be out of
integrity with yourself, Norma?

39:54.622 --> 39:56.527
I want you to leave.

39:57.390 --> 39:58.817
Why?

39:59.315 --> 40:01.817
Just 'cause you slept with your brother?

40:02.278 --> 40:05.637
Are you ashamed because he raped you?

40:09.455 --> 40:10.939
Or...

40:12.341 --> 40:14.985
are you ashamed because you loved him?

40:21.936 --> 40:24.294
- Huh.
- What do you want?

40:24.722 --> 40:26.534
Caleb beat me, stole my money,

40:26.654 --> 40:28.554
drove off my wife and child.

40:29.205 --> 40:33.020
He had no idea the cause
and effect of his actions,

40:33.140 --> 40:36.005
but that does not remove responsibility.

40:36.125 --> 40:38.083
He disappeared.

40:39.818 --> 40:41.927
I want to know where he is, Norma,

40:42.309 --> 40:44.167
and I want you to tell me.

40:46.330 --> 40:47.880
You want to kill him?

40:51.383 --> 40:53.280
Is that what you want?

40:54.105 --> 40:55.817
No.

41:00.937 --> 41:02.214
Why not?

41:05.019 --> 41:09.117
I mean, there must have
been times when you thought,

41:09.237 --> 41:11.337
"If I was just stronger,

41:11.457 --> 41:13.750
if I had a knife."

41:14.670 --> 41:17.182
I mean, why not? That
would feel good, right?

41:17.302 --> 41:19.698
After all this time, just to...

41:22.310 --> 41:24.560
Maybe you don't know what you want.

41:28.051 --> 41:29.314
Um...

41:31.263 --> 41:32.932
I... please, I...

41:35.092 --> 41:37.575
I don't know where he is.

41:37.695 --> 41:40.575
That's okay. You can think about it.

41:40.695 --> 41:42.033
And think about what you need,

41:42.153 --> 41:46.415
and I'll think about
what... what I need.

41:48.501 --> 41:49.756
All right.
