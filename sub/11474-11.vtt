00:00.357 --> 00:01.950
Previously on "Hunters"...

00:01.951 --> 00:03.816
I've got a DOD bird
that'll fly you to Alabama.

00:03.850 --> 00:06.252
From there you take a
car to Brecke's home.

00:06.286 --> 00:08.921
See if his recollection of
the attack on your unit

00:08.955 --> 00:10.089
is any better than yours.

00:10.123 --> 00:11.557
Something happened to me.

00:11.591 --> 00:12.591
To us.

00:13.994 --> 00:15.160
I need to get past it.

00:15.195 --> 00:18.264
Boys, stay inside!

00:18.298 --> 00:21.066
Confirming Brecke's Hunter, running
a hidden comms center.

00:21.101 --> 00:22.601
No sign of Flynn.

00:22.636 --> 00:24.303
You son of a bitch!

00:24.337 --> 00:25.571
You took Regan's father

00:25.605 --> 00:27.606
into custody at Finnerman's behest.

00:28.808 --> 00:31.910
Finnerman's taking point on 
interagency cooperation.

00:31.945 --> 00:33.078
I guess you're out of the loop.

00:33.113 --> 00:35.147
- I need to see you.
- You okay?

00:35.181 --> 00:37.621
I have papers and
photos from those boxes in our house.

00:37.651 --> 00:39.485
I know Abby isn't
who we thought she was.

00:39.519 --> 00:42.788
So you are to find out what
she knows and respond accordingly.

00:42.822 --> 00:45.024
You want me to contain her?

00:45.058 --> 00:46.492
Can I please just call my dad?

00:46.526 --> 00:48.294
- Flynn is not your dad.
- He's all I've got.

00:48.328 --> 00:51.196
Protect... protect the innocent ones.

00:51.231 --> 00:52.865
Help us, someone please help us!

01:26.700 --> 01:27.733
Carroll.

01:27.767 --> 01:28.867
It's Regan.

01:28.902 --> 01:30.669
Jackson needs us at HQ right away.

01:30.704 --> 01:32.584
Look, it's 4:00 in the
morning. I just got home.

01:32.605 --> 01:34.006
We caught a break

01:34.040 --> 01:36.175
off the Hunter you took out, Bob Brecke.

01:36.209 --> 01:38.177
Apparently, it's time sensitive.

01:38.211 --> 01:40.779
Okay, I'm on my way.

01:46.519 --> 01:48.554
Morning, sunshine. Miss
your beauty sleep?

01:48.588 --> 01:50.708
Well, some of us were up all
night cleaning Guano shit

01:50.724 --> 01:52.725
in Alabama while you
were getting your pedicure.

01:52.759 --> 01:54.660
This is Bob Brecke's setup from home.

01:54.694 --> 01:56.829
Brecke was using
Spotify just like McCarthy,

01:56.863 --> 01:58.597
embedding clicks into a music track.

01:58.631 --> 02:01.767
He shared the song publicly on
the Cymatics' Society playlist.

02:01.801 --> 02:05.070
We've been monitoring the
site, but this just went out.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.314
Hunters do love their new wave.

02:15.348 --> 02:17.383
No, it isn't random.

02:17.417 --> 02:19.118
The frequency makes it easy to embed

02:19.152 --> 02:20.886
their clicks into electronic tracks,

02:20.920 --> 02:23.589
but when you strip it all back...

02:27.660 --> 02:28.627
Stop there.

02:28.661 --> 02:29.962
Rewind it.

02:29.996 --> 02:31.797
Any idea what they're saying?

02:33.299 --> 02:35.434
It's the shape of Musa's
name over and over again.

02:35.468 --> 02:36.902
That's all I can make out.

02:36.936 --> 02:39.338
- Oh, that's bloody useful.
- Uh, actually it is.

02:39.372 --> 02:41.774
Turing didn't have much more when
he cracked the enigma code.

02:41.808 --> 02:43.208
We'd be further along

02:43.243 --> 02:45.210
if Jules Calloway hadn't been a traitor.

02:45.245 --> 02:46.885
And if Regan's
father wasn't blowing smoke

02:46.913 --> 02:49.281
up everyone's asses,
pretending to help us.

02:49.315 --> 02:51.083
All right, Briggs, enough.

02:51.117 --> 02:52.918
Steph's team is making good progress,

02:52.952 --> 02:54.420
but we have to move quickly.

02:54.454 --> 02:55.921
When the Hunters find
out we've compromised

02:55.955 --> 02:57.790
their communications, they'll go dark.

02:57.824 --> 02:59.324
And shut the whole system down.

02:59.359 --> 03:02.094
And we'll be left holding
each other's...

03:02.128 --> 03:03.195
hands.

03:05.698 --> 03:07.833
Rough night?

03:07.867 --> 03:10.235
Slumber party.

03:10.270 --> 03:11.270
You?

03:11.304 --> 03:12.304
I went to see Emme.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.642
I've been trying to reach her.

03:16.676 --> 03:17.676
What's up?

03:17.710 --> 03:18.944
Emme knows about Abby.

03:18.978 --> 03:21.346
She found some paperwork in your garage,

03:21.381 --> 03:23.015
from McCarthy storage unit.

03:23.049 --> 03:25.484
Why the hell did you keep them?

03:25.518 --> 03:27.019
I wasn't about to turn that shit in,

03:27.053 --> 03:28.220
not with a mole around.

03:29.589 --> 03:30.823
How much did she see?

03:30.857 --> 03:32.724
Enough to know Abby isn't human.

03:32.759 --> 03:34.259
Great.

03:34.294 --> 03:37.162
She must be totally freaked out.

03:37.197 --> 03:38.697
Who else knows?

03:38.731 --> 03:41.333
ETU intercepted a call from her to you.

03:41.367 --> 03:44.670
Finnerman sent me to find
out just how much she knew.

03:44.704 --> 03:46.138
Finnerman?

03:46.172 --> 03:48.106
Finnerman tried to bribe
me into containing Emme.

03:48.141 --> 03:51.276
Said she'd give me my
father's body if I gave her Emme's.

03:51.311 --> 03:53.879
- She wanted you to kill my kid?
- It's okay.

03:53.913 --> 03:56.348
She's safe. I made sure of that.

03:56.382 --> 03:59.485
So you lied to Finnerman and Jackson.

03:59.519 --> 04:02.688
I don't know what you're talking about.

04:04.657 --> 04:06.625
Thank you.

04:06.659 --> 04:08.393
She's innocent.

04:08.428 --> 04:12.130
You're her dad. You two need each other.

04:12.165 --> 04:14.800
Protect the innocent ones.

04:14.834 --> 04:16.668
Those were Ted's last words.

04:16.702 --> 04:18.070
There's also this.

04:20.874 --> 04:23.876
Ted saying the exact same
thing to Regan seconds earlier.

04:23.910 --> 04:26.812
Protect the innocent ones.

04:26.846 --> 04:29.322
But this time, just to make
sure the message gets through,

04:29.323 --> 04:31.550
he hammers it home in Hunter clicks.

04:36.189 --> 04:37.309
That's a direct translation.

04:39.726 --> 04:42.694
As in, direct direct.

04:42.729 --> 04:45.531
He gave us the
alphabet, in plain English.

04:45.565 --> 04:48.267
These two messages
combined with Brecke's transmissions

04:48.301 --> 04:51.203
are the cipher to Hunter communications.

04:51.237 --> 04:53.071
You've broken their language?

04:53.106 --> 04:55.474
Smashed their enigma wide open.

04:55.508 --> 04:57.109
My team are already writing code

04:57.143 --> 04:58.743
to translate hunter clicks into English.

04:58.745 --> 05:00.712
By tomorrow, you can
expect a dictionary.

05:00.747 --> 05:03.048
So Ted helped us after all.

05:03.082 --> 05:05.851
That's a substantial breakthrough,
Steph, well done.

05:05.885 --> 05:07.419
Can this translation
work the other way around?

05:07.453 --> 05:09.087
English to Hunter clicks, absolutely.

05:09.122 --> 05:10.956
You want to send out a message?

05:10.990 --> 05:14.626
Not a message.

05:14.661 --> 05:17.095
An order.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.459
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

05:35.548 --> 05:37.950
I need to go see Emme.

05:37.984 --> 05:41.720
Agent Regan reported Emme's
phone call was a false alarm.

05:41.754 --> 05:44.122
She doesn't suspect a thing.

05:44.157 --> 05:45.757
You don't look so good.

05:45.792 --> 05:46.825
You been to see medical yet?

05:46.859 --> 05:49.394
Haven't seen Emme in a week.

05:49.429 --> 05:51.630
I just need a little face time with her.

05:51.664 --> 05:54.199
You have kids, you get it.

05:54.233 --> 05:55.767
Sure.

05:55.802 --> 05:57.372
You go on, I'll keep you posted.

05:57.516 --> 05:59.338
Sir.

06:10.149 --> 06:12.784
Cracking the code really
is a game-changer.

06:12.819 --> 06:15.253
I'm thrilled for you.

06:15.288 --> 06:17.356
I know it's come at a great cost,

06:17.390 --> 06:20.359
but your father wanted to
protect all the innocent,

06:20.393 --> 06:22.427
that means humans, too.

06:22.462 --> 06:24.262
His translation will help us do that.

06:24.297 --> 06:27.466
It's not the
translating that killed him.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.501
She did.

06:29.535 --> 06:32.537
Don't quit the ETU because of Finnerman.

06:32.572 --> 06:34.640
I wouldn't give her the satisfaction.

06:34.674 --> 06:36.108
This message succeeds,

06:36.142 --> 06:38.210
it will be because of your father.

06:38.244 --> 06:39.411
And you.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.095
Musa?

08:11.838 --> 08:15.440
It has been so long
since I have worn my own skin.

08:15.475 --> 08:16.608
But we are close.

08:16.642 --> 08:19.478
Soon, we will all be as one again.

08:19.512 --> 08:22.114
Our battles will be over.

08:22.148 --> 08:24.750
We just received an
urgent message from Bob Brecke,

08:24.784 --> 08:27.786
- except it's not from Bob.
- Who's it from?

08:27.820 --> 08:29.988
It's in our language and
it says it's from you.

08:38.898 --> 08:42.801
"This is Musa, the Purge is
upon us, we gather today."

08:42.835 --> 08:43.969
And then there's an address.

08:44.003 --> 08:45.103
Where?

08:45.138 --> 08:46.838
A hotel in rural Ohio.

08:51.173 --> 08:53.339
They're setting a trap.

08:57.350 --> 09:00.299
Everyone's been waiting
years for a message like this.

09:00.479 --> 09:02.380
Now they're walking into a trap.

09:02.414 --> 09:03.514
We have to warn them.

09:03.549 --> 09:04.549
We can't.

09:04.583 --> 09:06.217
The ETUs shut down our system

09:06.251 --> 09:07.985
after they sent out the bogus message.

09:08.020 --> 09:10.521
Then we set up another one.

09:10.556 --> 09:12.390
We're less than a week
out from the Purge.

09:12.424 --> 09:13.591
There's no time.

09:13.625 --> 09:14.692
What do you propose, then?

09:14.726 --> 09:16.060
We do nothing.

09:18.831 --> 09:20.431
We could contact the ETU.

09:21.533 --> 09:23.401
Flynn, negotiate.

09:23.435 --> 09:25.770
We don't negotiate with animals.

09:25.804 --> 09:28.963
That's probably what they say about us.

09:29.116 --> 09:29.774
You would know.

09:29.808 --> 09:31.709
- Our people are gonna die.
- They won't be the first.

09:31.743 --> 09:34.579
Enough.

09:34.613 --> 09:38.249
We use the number station as a
contingency, stop who we can.

09:38.283 --> 09:39.884
Number station?

09:39.918 --> 09:41.085
Radio broadcasts.

09:41.119 --> 09:42.599
It's what we used before the Internet.

09:42.621 --> 09:44.222
We haven't used the
number station in over a decade.

09:44.256 --> 09:46.390
Nobody will be listening.

09:46.425 --> 09:47.792
Some will.

09:47.826 --> 09:49.460
As soon as they
realize the network is down.

09:49.495 --> 09:52.096
It won't save them all.

09:52.130 --> 09:55.366
And the Hunters who
show up at the hotel?

09:55.400 --> 09:57.335
They're already dead.

10:06.178 --> 10:07.945
Hey.

10:11.049 --> 10:12.316
Are you okay?

10:12.351 --> 10:14.652
No. You lied to me about Abby.

10:16.955 --> 10:18.289
I did it to protect you.

10:18.323 --> 10:20.424
I was trying to keep you safe.

10:20.459 --> 10:24.595
So everything Regan
told me is really true.

10:29.935 --> 10:31.202
What kind is she?

10:31.236 --> 10:33.738
What do you mean?

10:33.772 --> 10:37.875
Is she a gray one or
something reptilian?

10:37.910 --> 10:39.076
What planet is she from?

10:39.111 --> 10:40.611
I don't know.

10:40.646 --> 10:42.580
There's lots I don't
know and that's the truth.

10:42.614 --> 10:45.883
Emme, you have to listen to me.

10:45.918 --> 10:47.051
The people I work for

10:47.085 --> 10:50.688
are very, very serious
about keeping this a secret.

10:50.722 --> 10:52.323
Do you understand what I'm saying?

10:52.357 --> 10:54.492
Yeah.

10:54.526 --> 10:57.161
Your friend pulled a gun on me.

10:57.195 --> 10:59.997
That was pretty serious.

11:02.234 --> 11:06.871
Emme, just... don't
tell anyone about Abby.

11:06.905 --> 11:09.106
Promise?

11:09.141 --> 11:10.374
Not a soul.

11:11.577 --> 11:14.545
I won't.

11:14.580 --> 11:17.148
But will you promise not
to lie to me again?

11:17.182 --> 11:21.919
I promise I won't lie to you again.

11:30.762 --> 11:32.396
Sorry.

11:33.070 --> 11:35.666
_

11:36.268 --> 11:38.002
You work for some pretty scary people.

11:38.036 --> 11:42.139
The bad guys are worse.

11:42.174 --> 11:44.609
Is Abby bad?

11:47.245 --> 11:49.580
I don't know.

11:56.054 --> 11:58.289
We have a clear
visual of the hotel

11:58.426 --> 12:02.493
from our temp command center via CCTV.

12:02.527 --> 12:06.230
We will clear out all
hotel guests and staff

12:06.264 --> 12:07.365
and move in our own people.

12:07.399 --> 12:09.667
Sever phone lines, shut down WiFi.

12:09.701 --> 12:12.870
Secure exits here, here, and here.

12:12.904 --> 12:13.938
When the Hunters have all arrived,

12:13.972 --> 12:15.172
the perimeter fence goes up.

12:15.207 --> 12:16.641
Nobody gets out.

12:16.675 --> 12:18.876
Like Noriega and the Panamanian church.

12:18.910 --> 12:20.645
Except we won't be
blasting heavy metal music.

12:20.679 --> 12:23.414
We'll give the Hunters an
eight-hour window to arrive

12:23.448 --> 12:25.416
and then move in and detain.

12:25.450 --> 12:27.051
How many can we expect?

12:27.085 --> 12:29.787
We know that hundreds listen
to the track with our message.

12:29.821 --> 12:32.890
We have no way of predicting
how many will show up, if any.

12:32.924 --> 12:35.626
For all we know, Musa
has a backup system

12:35.661 --> 12:38.362
and he's told his
followers that our message is fake.

12:38.397 --> 12:40.765
If any do show up, we can
always use them as bait.

12:40.799 --> 12:42.400
Or collateral.

12:42.434 --> 12:44.135
Even better.

12:44.169 --> 12:46.270
Their lives in
exchange for stopping the Purge.

12:46.304 --> 12:50.074
We have a psy-ops battalion
on standby at White Hall.

12:50.108 --> 12:51.776
The mission is to detain.

12:53.278 --> 12:54.645
Any more questions?

12:54.680 --> 12:56.313
Just one.

12:56.348 --> 12:58.983
Where's our fearless Hunter
killer when we need him?

12:59.017 --> 13:02.019
Flynn is on his way.

13:02.054 --> 13:03.154
I should be inside.

13:03.188 --> 13:05.089
I need you guarding the perimeter.

13:05.123 --> 13:06.891
I can tell who's Hunter right away,

13:06.925 --> 13:09.860
and I can find out what they
know about Musa and the Purge.

13:11.596 --> 13:13.464
All right, get changed.

13:15.967 --> 13:18.803
Hunters have proved a formidable enemy.

13:18.837 --> 13:20.271
Is detention really an option?

13:20.305 --> 13:22.339
We have the element of surprise.

13:22.374 --> 13:26.043
We've chosen our location, we
can surround it and control.

13:26.078 --> 13:27.778
This is the best opportunity
we've had yet

13:27.813 --> 13:29.313
to capture Hunters in large numbers.

13:29.347 --> 13:30.748
Capture?

13:30.782 --> 13:32.950
The value of the
information we stand to gain

13:32.984 --> 13:34.618
is immeasurable.

13:34.653 --> 13:37.021
We don't have the
facilities to house large numbers

13:37.055 --> 13:38.522
of these types of detainees.

13:38.557 --> 13:40.124
As you know.

13:40.158 --> 13:41.852
Security will need to be tightened

13:42.012 --> 13:43.127
before we try that again.

13:43.161 --> 13:47.465
Detaining them will require substantial
infrastructure, yes.

13:47.499 --> 13:51.035
We may need to beg a favor or two.

13:51.069 --> 13:53.704
I never beg Truss. You know that.

13:53.739 --> 13:57.007
I'll start making arrangements.

14:26.471 --> 14:27.538
No one showed.

14:27.572 --> 14:29.006
Maybe we should pack it up.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.207
We wait.

14:30.242 --> 14:31.275
Keep the line clear.

14:35.147 --> 14:36.180
Car.

14:36.214 --> 14:38.516
And clicks.

14:38.550 --> 14:39.850
Trap's working.

14:39.885 --> 14:41.652
Or they're using our
own trap against us.

14:41.686 --> 14:44.321
We could be sitting ducks.

14:44.356 --> 14:45.823
Or should I say rabbits.

14:50.629 --> 14:51.829
Coming to you, Regan.

15:11.550 --> 15:12.917
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:12.951 --> 15:14.018
We'd like a room, please.

15:14.052 --> 15:15.719
Sure, let me see what we have.

15:15.754 --> 15:17.188
Non-smoking.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.661
We've got our first arrivals.

15:26.832 --> 15:28.299
You can't say anything about Abby

15:28.333 --> 15:32.036
over phone calls, e-mail, text.

15:32.070 --> 15:33.704
Everything can be traced.

15:33.738 --> 15:35.506
Snapchat disappears.

15:36.541 --> 15:37.942
Not from us.

15:37.976 --> 15:40.477
Emme, if you need to talk.

15:40.512 --> 15:43.147
You're scared,
anything, just text or call me.

15:43.181 --> 15:44.481
Flynn.

15:44.516 --> 15:45.950
Just don't mention the "A" word.

15:45.984 --> 15:47.017
Flynn.

16:01.055 --> 16:02.700
What are you doing here?

16:02.780 --> 16:04.080
I thought you were dead.

16:04.114 --> 16:05.748
It's okay. Don't be scared.

16:05.783 --> 16:06.783
Get back into the school.

16:06.784 --> 16:07.917
I know what you are.

16:07.952 --> 16:09.919
- You told her?
- I figured it out!

16:09.954 --> 16:11.754
Inside, now!

16:11.789 --> 16:13.323
Emme, I'm still the same person.

16:13.357 --> 16:15.224
You're not a person.

16:15.259 --> 16:16.593
I'm the same Abby who loves you.

16:16.627 --> 16:18.394
What are you doing, Flynn?

16:18.429 --> 16:19.562
You don't know if she's bad or not!

16:19.597 --> 16:20.597
That's what you said.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.215
Listen to Flynn, Emme.

16:24.101 --> 16:26.436
Emme, we're just gonna talk.

16:26.470 --> 16:28.271
That's right. Please, go inside.

16:28.305 --> 16:31.140
This is not proper conflict resolution!

16:36.780 --> 16:39.282
You are no longer part of this family.

16:39.316 --> 16:40.850
You leave Emme alone.

16:40.884 --> 16:44.002
I'm sorry, I know I
shouldn't be here, but it's urgent.

16:44.622 --> 16:45.955
No freaky backup this time?

16:45.990 --> 16:48.625
Just me, I swear. We need to talk.

16:48.659 --> 16:51.594
About our feelings?

16:51.629 --> 16:53.796
Sorry. That ship sailed.

16:53.831 --> 16:56.466
Not about us, about
what's happening right now.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.868
With the ETU and the
message from Bob Brecke.

17:01.505 --> 17:03.973
Down there.

17:04.008 --> 17:05.174
Move.

17:06.477 --> 17:08.243
Move!

17:19.356 --> 17:20.876
Steph has the numbers at 15.

17:20.891 --> 17:22.124
Please confirm.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.227
I count 17 so far.

17:24.261 --> 17:26.796
Two more.

17:26.829 --> 17:28.164
Like fish in a barrel.

17:28.198 --> 17:30.933
You sure they're all Hunters?

17:31.802 --> 17:33.870
I'm sure.

17:39.209 --> 17:40.877
Weird.

17:40.911 --> 17:44.480
It's like they're a bunch of
Docker dads and soccer moms.

17:44.515 --> 17:45.882
Don't let your guard down.

17:45.916 --> 17:47.583
Someone there must know about the Purge.

17:50.521 --> 17:51.921
Hang on.

17:58.429 --> 18:00.797
I might have something.

18:04.468 --> 18:06.703
What have you got?

18:26.490 --> 18:29.525
Hi.

18:29.560 --> 18:34.797
I overheard your
conversation about Musa.

18:34.832 --> 18:36.933
I'm sorry, I don't know why we're here.

18:36.967 --> 18:38.101
Do you?

18:38.135 --> 18:39.736
That's what I keep asking.

18:39.770 --> 18:42.038
We don't know, either.

18:42.072 --> 18:44.240
We just heard the message to come here.

18:44.274 --> 18:46.642
Me too.

18:46.677 --> 18:49.045
I'm Allison.

18:49.079 --> 18:51.414
I'm Bai.

18:51.448 --> 18:54.050
And this is my husband, Jeff.

18:54.084 --> 18:55.451
That's Lily.

18:55.486 --> 18:56.552
I like your boots.

18:56.587 --> 19:00.356
Thanks. I like your shoes, too.

19:01.125 --> 19:02.725
You a teacher?

19:02.760 --> 19:06.129
History and sociology,
Des Moines junior high.

19:06.163 --> 19:07.730
I'm a pediatrician.

19:07.765 --> 19:09.232
And I'm in fourth grade.

19:09.266 --> 19:10.733
Really?

19:10.768 --> 19:12.268
I go to Seattle University.

19:12.302 --> 19:13.970
Guess we're both students.

19:14.004 --> 19:15.638
You're kind of old to be a student.

19:15.672 --> 19:18.674
Lily.

19:20.444 --> 19:23.679
So Musa called us here for the Purge?

19:23.714 --> 19:25.481
Yes.

19:25.516 --> 19:26.749
Do you know what that is?

19:29.887 --> 19:31.287
What do you mean Abby's gone?

19:31.321 --> 19:32.755
Where?

19:32.790 --> 19:34.357
She left just after we got the message.

19:34.391 --> 19:36.125
I bet she's gone to warn
the Hunters at the hotel.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.127
Risking her life to save others.

19:38.162 --> 19:39.262
She's a brave soldier.

19:39.296 --> 19:40.963
She's an idiot.

19:40.998 --> 19:42.697
We'll lose her along with
the rest of them, or worse.

19:42.811 --> 19:46.202
They'll capture Abby and torture
her for our location.

19:46.236 --> 19:49.105
How many of your
people have died for you, hmm?

19:49.139 --> 19:50.539
This isn't a sacrifice she's making.

19:50.541 --> 19:51.607
It's a mistake.

19:51.642 --> 19:54.210
Since we came here,

19:54.244 --> 19:57.013
I have had to ask countless
Hunters to give their lives.

19:57.047 --> 20:00.016
I remember all their
faces and all their names.

20:00.050 --> 20:01.751
They also died for you, Liana.

20:01.785 --> 20:02.752
For all of us.

20:04.955 --> 20:06.889
I'm not prepared to lose any more.

20:06.924 --> 20:08.491
I'll bring them back.

20:08.525 --> 20:11.160
The hotel will be surrounded.

20:11.195 --> 20:13.029
No way in or out. Don't be foolish.

20:17.201 --> 20:19.635
There is always a way.

20:23.774 --> 20:25.478
You need to call off the roundup.

20:26.343 --> 20:28.344
You first.

20:28.378 --> 20:30.146
Call Musa, tell him to stop the Purge.

20:30.180 --> 20:31.480
Flynn, listen to me.

20:31.515 --> 20:33.182
The Purge isn't what you think.

20:33.217 --> 20:35.418
You're launching a nuclear attack on us.

20:35.452 --> 20:37.787
We're calling off nothing.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.488
No, that's what I came here to tell you.

20:39.523 --> 20:41.891
We're not planning an attack.

20:43.093 --> 20:48.164
We're trying to leave Earth.

20:49.466 --> 20:50.700
Leave?

20:50.734 --> 20:53.169
We're not purging the Earth of humans.

20:53.203 --> 20:57.006
We're purging the Earth of us.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.908
We're going home, Flynn.

21:02.479 --> 21:04.547
Everything we've done
has all been for this.

21:04.581 --> 21:08.050
To go back where we
came from, where we belong.

21:08.085 --> 21:10.052
So everything.

21:10.087 --> 21:12.588
The bombings. The drugs.

21:12.623 --> 21:16.058
- The killings.
- Were a means to an end.

21:16.093 --> 21:19.695
And not the one you think.

21:19.730 --> 21:21.297
If we wanted to attack humans,

21:21.331 --> 21:23.065
we would have already, but we don't.

21:23.100 --> 21:25.601
It's not what we want
and it never has been.

21:28.872 --> 21:31.173
Please tell me you believe me.

21:33.577 --> 21:35.611
I believe you.

21:38.916 --> 21:40.516
Thank you.

21:51.728 --> 21:56.367
If you lie to me again, you're dead.

22:05.845 --> 22:07.481
You believe her?

22:08.088 --> 22:11.658
Definitely not. But then I'm biased.

22:20.167 --> 22:22.201
This is Abby.

22:22.236 --> 22:23.936
Thank you for coming to see us.

22:23.971 --> 22:25.905
I'm Commander Truss Jackson.

22:25.939 --> 22:28.074
If you're going
home, as you say you are,

22:28.108 --> 22:30.543
why do you need lithium or WMDs?

22:30.577 --> 22:31.611
They're not weapons.

22:31.645 --> 22:32.779
They're to be used in the launch.

22:32.813 --> 22:34.047
Really?

22:34.081 --> 22:35.648
Why did Musa send you?

22:35.683 --> 22:37.083
He doesn't know I'm here.

22:37.117 --> 22:39.085
I came because you
need to know the truth.

22:39.119 --> 22:41.754
The Hunters who are
inside, they're innocents.

22:41.789 --> 22:44.557
Not according to what we
know about Hunters so far.

22:44.591 --> 22:47.093
You are drug dealers, murderers,
and terrorists.

22:47.127 --> 22:48.594
You're wrong.

22:48.629 --> 22:50.463
They're not sleeper
agents and they're not criminals.

22:50.497 --> 22:52.165
Uh-uh.

22:52.199 --> 22:55.068
Every Hunter in there had to take
a human life to look human,

22:55.102 --> 22:56.803
just like you did.

22:56.837 --> 22:59.272
We all had to, but it was the
only way we could survive.

22:59.306 --> 23:00.406
It's still murder.

23:02.710 --> 23:04.277
Much as I'd like to believe you,

23:04.311 --> 23:05.912
I have only your word to go on.

23:05.946 --> 23:08.481
- Do you have any hard evidence?
- No.

23:08.515 --> 23:11.584
But why would I risk coming
here if it isn't the truth?

23:11.618 --> 23:12.919
To create a diversion

23:12.953 --> 23:14.587
and aide your colleague's escape.

23:16.056 --> 23:17.353
Go for Jackson.

23:17.468 --> 23:19.492
Jackson, we need to talk in person.

23:19.526 --> 23:20.793
Not now.

23:20.828 --> 23:22.095
No, this can't wait.

23:22.129 --> 23:23.963
I might have intel about the Purge.

23:23.997 --> 23:26.399
Meet me in the service tunnel.

23:26.433 --> 23:27.400
I'm on my way.

23:29.970 --> 23:31.104
Secure her.

23:31.138 --> 23:33.072
Armed guard at all times.

23:58.298 --> 24:00.233
Ma'am.

24:00.267 --> 24:01.801
What do you have for me?

24:01.835 --> 24:04.070
This way.

24:07.141 --> 24:09.408
- Flynn.
- Don't.

24:09.443 --> 24:12.178
You don't get to speak.

24:12.212 --> 24:14.080
Everything you ever said is a lie.

24:14.114 --> 24:16.649
I was just trying to look after my own.

24:16.683 --> 24:18.918
It's all I've ever done.

24:18.952 --> 24:20.720
You keep telling yourself that.

24:20.754 --> 24:21.888
You were a soldier.

24:21.922 --> 24:23.356
You killed for your country.

24:23.390 --> 24:25.024
How is what I've done so different?

24:25.058 --> 24:27.260
War is war.

24:27.294 --> 24:30.930
Family is family. We had a family.

24:34.868 --> 24:37.937
You broke Emme's heart.

24:41.341 --> 24:43.409
I never meant to hurt her.

24:43.443 --> 24:46.712
Yeah, well, it
didn't work out like that,

24:46.747 --> 24:49.916
did it?

24:49.950 --> 24:52.852
Flynn.

24:52.886 --> 24:55.621
When you see Emme,

24:55.656 --> 24:57.690
tell her I love her and
that I'll miss her.

25:03.197 --> 25:04.764
Please.

25:15.342 --> 25:18.044
Everyone's talking
about swimming lessons and timeshares,

25:18.078 --> 25:19.846
not blowing anything up.

25:19.880 --> 25:21.981
They are part of Musa's terror network.

25:22.015 --> 25:23.916
Otherwise, they wouldn't even be here.

25:23.951 --> 25:27.253
Being a Hunter doesn't
automatically make you a terrorist.

25:27.287 --> 25:29.288
By that logic, I'm a terrorist, too.

25:29.323 --> 25:30.523
You're different.

25:30.557 --> 25:32.658
So are the Hunters inside.

25:32.693 --> 25:34.510
None of them have speeding tickets,

25:34.654 --> 25:36.295
let alone criminal records.

25:36.330 --> 25:38.464
I'm sure their orders were to lay low,

25:38.498 --> 25:40.301
but even if some of them
aren't terrorists,

25:40.302 --> 25:41.411
we can't just let them go.

25:41.536 --> 25:43.569
We can't just lock them
up because they're Hunters.

25:43.604 --> 25:44.837
We are detaining them.

25:44.872 --> 25:45.905
Where?

25:45.939 --> 25:47.173
Another black site?

25:47.207 --> 25:48.774
Torture them like my dad?

25:48.809 --> 25:50.376
They didn't do anything wrong.

25:55.849 --> 25:57.950
Protect the innocent ones.

25:57.985 --> 26:00.519
There are families in there.

26:00.554 --> 26:02.855
Children just like I was.

26:06.727 --> 26:08.594
I'll talk to Finnerman.

26:16.937 --> 26:18.771
How many do we have?

26:18.805 --> 26:21.240
47.

26:23.410 --> 26:24.510
Lock it down.

26:24.544 --> 26:25.745
No one else goes in or out.

26:29.683 --> 26:31.717
We are go for lockdown.

26:31.752 --> 26:34.954
Lockdown in effect, repeat,
lockdown in effect.

26:34.988 --> 26:38.491
Any agent still
inside, get out immediately.

26:38.525 --> 26:40.660
Falcon four, counter response,

26:40.694 --> 26:42.528
get into position.

26:59.446 --> 27:01.013
We're in position.

27:01.048 --> 27:02.114
Ready to move in.

27:09.823 --> 27:10.890
You have to go.

27:10.924 --> 27:11.924
Why?

27:11.959 --> 27:13.292
Come on.

27:13.327 --> 27:15.161
It's a trap. Let's go.

27:15.195 --> 27:16.996
What? No.

27:17.030 --> 27:21.500
I know a way out, follow me, now!

27:24.504 --> 27:26.605
It's the last open exit.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.074
Run!

27:28.108 --> 27:31.110
Stay together. Don't look back.

27:31.144 --> 27:32.078
Be brave, okay?

27:32.112 --> 27:33.846
Go.

27:38.819 --> 27:40.686
Lockdown is my call.

27:40.721 --> 27:42.288
We've lost the element of surprise.

27:42.322 --> 27:43.356
It's time to strike.

27:43.390 --> 27:45.124
This is my operation, Ruth.

27:45.158 --> 27:47.226
Suspicious vehicle, south perimeter.

27:47.260 --> 27:48.648
Everybody on full alert.

28:01.208 --> 28:02.641
Out of the vehicle!

28:20.293 --> 28:22.661
I want to see Truss Jackson.

28:32.335 --> 28:34.332
Get down.

28:36.502 --> 28:38.336
On your knees!

28:39.939 --> 28:41.506
Watch his hands!

28:41.541 --> 28:43.842
Get on your
knees or I'll shoot!

28:52.452 --> 28:53.485
Musa.

29:05.331 --> 29:07.032
To surrender.

29:07.066 --> 29:09.067
With a suicide vest?

29:09.102 --> 29:11.737
It's to stop you from killing me.

29:11.771 --> 29:16.374
If you're here to
surrender, then surrender.

29:16.409 --> 29:17.976
We won't shoot.

29:19.112 --> 29:20.145
You have my word.

29:23.597 --> 29:26.218
My people will fight to the death.

29:26.252 --> 29:29.621
Unless I tell them to surrender.

29:29.655 --> 29:31.690
If you let me inside, I will calm them,

29:31.724 --> 29:35.160
then we will all surrender, peacefully.

29:35.194 --> 29:37.062
Don't trust him.

29:38.631 --> 29:41.867
No one gets hurt this
way, on either side.

29:41.901 --> 29:44.770
Tell me where your weapons are.

29:44.804 --> 29:46.204
Please, Jackson.

29:46.239 --> 29:49.875
Let's bring this to a peaceful end, eh?

29:49.909 --> 29:53.111
No WMDs, no deal.

30:04.157 --> 30:07.926
You take off your
vest and I'll let you in.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.761
No!

30:09.796 --> 30:11.863
Yes.

30:15.854 --> 30:17.754
Thank you.

30:31.951 --> 30:33.630
Now the vest.

30:34.253 --> 30:36.121
That's right, all the way off.

30:39.592 --> 30:41.560
Slowly.

30:48.534 --> 30:50.168
Check 'em for weapons.

30:52.071 --> 30:53.351
And then let 'em in.

30:59.011 --> 31:00.545
Clear.

31:03.783 --> 31:07.152
Wait.

31:07.186 --> 31:09.307
Check his back.

31:18.898 --> 31:20.932
You've just given him
exactly what he wanted.

31:20.967 --> 31:24.402
The operation has changed.

31:54.267 --> 31:57.102
They led you here like
lambs to the slaughter.

31:59.672 --> 32:01.573
I have come to set you free!

32:03.511 --> 32:05.745
We're gonna have
another Waco on our hands.

32:05.780 --> 32:09.216
No. We have the terrorists
exactly where we want them.

32:09.250 --> 32:11.051
Regan is inside.

32:11.085 --> 32:13.286
Her intel has these
Hunters as part of a network,

32:13.321 --> 32:15.121
but not engaging in any
criminal activities!

32:15.156 --> 32:17.123
Agent Regan can't be trusted.

32:17.158 --> 32:20.393
Agent Regan has
repeatedly proven her loyalty!

32:20.428 --> 32:22.295
She helped these Hunters escape.

32:22.330 --> 32:24.464
Let them out a secure door.

32:24.499 --> 32:26.500
Well, there must be some explanation.

32:26.534 --> 32:28.802
There is. Treason.

32:28.836 --> 32:29.970
Take those Hunters

32:30.004 --> 32:33.006
and Carroll's wife inside the hotel.

32:33.040 --> 32:34.708
My pleasure.

32:39.380 --> 32:40.814
What are you doing?

32:43.384 --> 32:44.985
Echo Protocol.

32:46.053 --> 32:47.821
You're going to kill them all?

32:47.855 --> 32:49.322
That's genocide.

32:49.357 --> 32:52.859
Genocide? Oh, please, Jackson.

32:52.894 --> 32:54.794
There's what? 47 of them?

32:54.829 --> 32:56.863
There's plenty more
where they came from,

32:56.898 --> 32:58.832
and we need to strike at their numbers

32:58.866 --> 32:59.833
while we still can.

32:59.867 --> 33:00.895
If you kill everyone,

33:00.896 --> 33:02.602
we'll have no way of finding
out where their nukes are.

33:02.637 --> 33:04.070
They are a useless asset.

33:04.105 --> 33:05.772
It'll take years to crack a Hunter,

33:05.806 --> 33:07.507
time that we don't have.

33:07.542 --> 33:08.842
What about Regan?

33:10.711 --> 33:11.878
She stays with her kind.

33:11.913 --> 33:13.947
She's my agent, not yours.

33:13.981 --> 33:15.515
I've made my decision.

33:15.550 --> 33:19.519
You are no longer in command here.

33:20.855 --> 33:22.055
I'm pulling her out.

33:22.089 --> 33:23.356
Get him out of here.

33:24.425 --> 33:25.959
Take your hands off me.

33:25.993 --> 33:29.029
You told me this was
a detainment mission!

33:29.063 --> 33:32.432
This is wrong.

33:34.635 --> 33:37.637
Initiate Echo Protocol.

33:37.672 --> 33:40.807
No Hunter leaves alive.

33:43.422 --> 33:44.501
Our Intel is clear.

33:44.818 --> 33:47.037
The Hunter combatants are
not willing to surrender,

33:47.071 --> 33:49.473
therefore they leave us no choice.

33:49.507 --> 33:51.008
Biochemical weapons are,

33:51.042 --> 33:53.243
unfortunately, not yet an option.

33:53.277 --> 33:55.345
This is a kill mission.

33:55.380 --> 33:57.481
All Hunters are to be shot on site.

33:57.515 --> 33:59.716
Every last one of them.

33:59.751 --> 34:01.485
Commence.

34:01.519 --> 34:03.920
Regan's in there.

34:03.955 --> 34:06.923
Are you using her as an
excuse to go in and rescue your wife?

34:06.958 --> 34:10.193
I delivered her to you, cuffed.

34:10.228 --> 34:12.462
I didn't expect her to walk out of here.

34:12.496 --> 34:15.232
We will not forget your sacrifice,

34:15.266 --> 34:16.933
all that you have lost.

34:16.967 --> 34:19.202
You are a true patriot.

34:21.472 --> 34:23.507
Easy for the generals to say

34:23.541 --> 34:26.275
when they're nowhere
near the battle lines.

34:26.310 --> 34:27.710
If I could go in there

34:27.745 --> 34:31.915
and lay down my life here
today, I would do that.

34:31.949 --> 34:36.119
We are what those monsters fear,

34:36.154 --> 34:38.955
and they will fear us.

34:48.166 --> 34:50.266
Jackson, Flynn, what's happening?

34:50.301 --> 34:52.034
Briggs?

34:52.070 --> 34:54.971
Come on, it's me, your favorite Guano.

34:59.825 --> 35:02.058
_

36:43.014 --> 36:44.314
Get everyone upstairs.

36:44.348 --> 36:45.916
This way!

36:50.721 --> 36:52.923
Wait!

36:54.492 --> 36:56.359
We have defeated the Exalted

36:56.394 --> 36:58.328
and we will defeat this enemy, too.

36:58.362 --> 37:00.997
We all must give a piece of ourselves.

37:37.401 --> 37:39.236
Something's happening!

37:39.270 --> 37:41.805
The Hunters have
released some kind of tear gas.

37:41.839 --> 37:43.435
They're contained to the top floors.

37:43.436 --> 37:44.688
It's a trap!

37:46.677 --> 37:48.278
Do not pull back.

37:48.312 --> 37:50.981
Repeat, do not abandon the mission.

38:01.559 --> 38:04.411
It looks like the gas is
only affecting the humans!

38:16.674 --> 38:18.888
Agent
Briggs, what is the status of...

38:20.645 --> 38:22.479
Repeat, what is your status?

38:22.513 --> 38:24.014
We have lost communication.

38:27.218 --> 38:30.654
I can't hear
anything. I can't hear anything!

38:44.602 --> 38:48.204
Fall back. Fall back!

38:48.239 --> 38:50.340
It's a counter attack!

39:00.184 --> 39:01.518
Get out of there!

39:01.552 --> 39:06.556
Join Carroll, he's on the first floor!

40:10.488 --> 40:13.423
Carroll,
Regan is trying to escape.

40:13.457 --> 40:15.125
Stop her.

40:33.944 --> 40:35.779
We killed a child.

40:35.813 --> 40:38.181
They'll kill me, too.

40:50.027 --> 40:51.628
Come on.

40:51.662 --> 40:53.663
Let's get you out of here.
