00:00.747 --> 00:04.717
ANDRE: Gentlemen, I introduce you to the
newest addition of the Andre gallery:

00:05.785 --> 00:06.751
a Klumberg.

00:06.819 --> 00:08.420
PETE: Wow.

00:08.487 --> 00:09.054
KEVIN: God!

00:09.121 --> 00:11.689
I saw it in a gallery in
Telluride, and it spoke to me.

00:11.757 --> 00:15.226
I mean, every time I look at it, I still
get chills because it's so... Yeah.

00:15.294 --> 00:18.363
...powerful, I mean... TACO: Yeah, it's
a penis bird attacking ass mountain.

00:18.431 --> 00:19.931
(both chuckle)

00:19.999 --> 00:22.067
There's no penis here, okay?

00:22.134 --> 00:23.701
It's abstract.

00:23.769 --> 00:24.969
RUXIN: It is something.

00:25.037 --> 00:27.605
Why is the tip of the penis pink?

00:27.673 --> 00:29.541
It's art!
There doesn't need to be a reason!

00:29.608 --> 00:30.608
Use your imagination.

00:30.676 --> 00:33.545
Except for the part that makes
you think this is a penis bird.

00:33.612 --> 00:36.114
To me, it makes me feel like
the penis bird is dipped into

00:36.182 --> 00:38.450
ass mountain, and has then been
ejected, but he's taking a

00:38.517 --> 00:40.318
little bit of ass mountain with him.

00:40.386 --> 00:42.987
Or it could be going in at
an angle like the shocker.

00:43.055 --> 00:43.755
Yes.

00:43.823 --> 00:44.789
It's not a shocker.

00:44.857 --> 00:48.760
I don't think they're selling a
picture of the shocker for $25,000.

00:48.828 --> 00:49.727
Okay!

00:49.795 --> 00:50.562
What?!

00:50.629 --> 00:52.764
$25,000 American dollars?

00:52.832 --> 00:53.998
$25,000.

00:54.066 --> 00:54.799
Not bad, right?

00:54.867 --> 00:55.834
I mean, it's a Klumberg.

00:55.901 --> 00:56.734
What a steal.

00:56.802 --> 00:58.736
Yeah, that is definitely a crime.

00:58.804 --> 01:01.005
You could get pictures like
this for free on the Internet.

01:01.073 --> 01:02.140
No, it's art.

01:02.208 --> 01:04.342
It's colonialism, and
you'll never get it.

01:04.410 --> 01:07.345
Which part do you think's the dick?

01:07.346 --> 01:10.346
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:10.983 --> 01:12.117
This couch sucks.

01:12.184 --> 01:14.185
Well, don't cram into it then.

01:14.253 --> 01:18.356
RAFFI: Andre, I am sorry for what I just
did to your bathroom, bro. (chuckles)

01:18.424 --> 01:19.591
Why did you bring him?

01:19.658 --> 01:20.859
Because Sofia said I had to.

01:20.926 --> 01:22.427
Hey, man, will you
trade beers with me?

01:22.495 --> 01:23.027
Why?

01:23.095 --> 01:23.661
I tasted yours.

01:23.729 --> 01:24.496
I like it better.

01:24.563 --> 01:25.497
Wait. You had some of this?

01:25.564 --> 01:26.331
Yeah, just a minute ago.

01:26.398 --> 01:27.966
Raffi, don't drink
other people's beers.

01:28.033 --> 01:28.666
You're a dick.

01:28.734 --> 01:29.667
What? We're all hanging out.

01:29.735 --> 01:30.502
Here, it's all yours.

01:30.569 --> 01:31.169
Thanks, man.

01:31.237 --> 01:32.003
This house is cool.

01:32.071 --> 01:33.938
You know what you should
do in this place, Andre?

01:34.006 --> 01:35.540
Don't talk about
shooting a porno here.

01:35.608 --> 01:36.207
Shoot a porno.

01:36.275 --> 01:39.210
I got this buddy... If you talk about
Dirty Randy... ...Dirty Randy.

01:39.278 --> 01:40.211
This guy is amazing.

01:40.279 --> 01:41.179
I'm not interested.

01:41.247 --> 01:42.881
He scouts locations for pornos.

01:42.948 --> 01:43.681
I've used him before.

01:43.749 --> 01:44.649
It's great.

01:44.717 --> 01:45.650
They mostly clean everything up.

01:45.718 --> 01:47.485
I don't want to have
people having sex in here.

01:47.553 --> 01:48.153
Dude, are you?

01:48.154 --> 01:53.191
Somebody's gotta have sex in this place
I just jerked off in the bathroom, so that's three of us.

01:53.259 --> 01:54.859
I thought you were taking a shit.

01:54.927 --> 01:56.828
Yeah, I did both at the same time.

01:56.896 --> 01:57.962
Oh, come on, man!

01:58.030 --> 01:58.997
What? It's how I work!

01:59.064 --> 02:02.033
Raffi, isn't there somewhere
you're supposed to be?

02:02.101 --> 02:03.368
Yeah, I got a date tonight.

02:03.435 --> 02:04.335
Don't talk about Molly.

02:04.403 --> 02:05.303
Molly!

02:05.371 --> 02:06.137
You're dating Molly?

02:06.205 --> 02:08.306
Ah, I don't know if I
would call it "dating."

02:08.374 --> 02:08.907
You know her?

02:08.973 --> 02:11.142
Yeah, I went to the
party to talk to her.

02:11.210 --> 02:13.144
Oh, that's right.

02:13.212 --> 02:14.212
You blew it. (laughs)

02:14.280 --> 02:17.782
You guys, best friend
club Don't touch.

02:17.850 --> 02:19.517
You guys, fella, number one.

02:19.585 --> 02:22.654
If Dirty Randy comes by, don't
let him in if you're alone.

02:22.721 --> 02:23.955
He preys on the weak.

02:24.023 --> 02:25.123
Tell him not to come.

02:25.191 --> 02:27.058
Love you guys.

02:27.126 --> 02:31.996
Uh, Ruxin, I know that Raffi's family and
that he's one of our best friends and

02:32.064 --> 02:33.231
everything, but I hate him.

02:33.299 --> 02:34.199
Taco is right.

02:34.266 --> 02:35.066
That guy is a cancer.

02:35.134 --> 02:35.967
He's the worst, man.

02:36.035 --> 02:37.502
I mean... he really has...
He's horrible!

02:37.570 --> 02:38.536
He's terrible!

02:38.604 --> 02:39.737
I know! I agree!

02:39.805 --> 02:41.539
I want him gone!

02:41.607 --> 02:43.241
Well, then do something about it.

02:43.309 --> 02:45.176
I can't! He's family!

02:45.244 --> 02:46.411
He is my Fredo.

02:46.478 --> 02:47.712
He hasn't even won one game.

02:47.780 --> 02:50.815
<i>El Cu√±ado has made this
entire thing just unfun.</i>

02:50.883 --> 02:54.986
Well, if it's not fun
anymore, why do we do it?

02:55.054 --> 02:56.254
That's it.

02:56.322 --> 02:59.357
Guys, we disband the league.

02:59.425 --> 03:02.193
No, you can't disband the league.

03:02.261 --> 03:03.228
No, no, not for real.

03:03.295 --> 03:06.064
We have a big fake fight in
front of Raffi where he sees

03:06.131 --> 03:08.399
everything fall apart, then
the next day, we just start

03:08.467 --> 03:10.368
the league over again,
and he's none the wiser.

03:10.436 --> 03:11.002
Good, good.

03:11.070 --> 03:13.938
In order to save the
league, we gotta kill it.

03:14.006 --> 03:15.873
<i>This is just like
Ocean's Twelve.</i>

03:15.941 --> 03:16.874
<i>What?</i>

03:16.942 --> 03:19.377
<i>You're the little Asian guy,
I'm Bernie Mac, you're Casey</i>

03:19.445 --> 03:24.449
<i>Affleck... Maybe we should just
kill the league for real.</i>

03:24.516 --> 03:26.217
<i>Raffi is such an asshole.</i>

03:26.285 --> 03:27.919
<i>He always punches
me in the penis.</i>

03:27.987 --> 03:30.021
<i>JENNY: I have absolutely
no sympathy for you.</i>

03:30.089 --> 03:30.788
<i>I'm done.</i>

03:30.856 --> 03:33.091
<i>Ooh, I almost forgot,
it's garbage day.</i>

03:33.158 --> 03:34.993
<i>Taco, don't rummage through
other people's stuff.</i>

03:35.060 --> 03:36.261
<i>I'll catch up with you guys.</i>

03:36.328 --> 03:37.262
<i>Why does he do this?</i>

03:37.329 --> 03:40.398
<i>You know, at least he's not gonna
be taking it from our house.</i>

03:40.466 --> 03:41.332
<i>RUSSELL: Kevin, hey. Russell.</i>

03:41.400 --> 03:42.333
<i>Hey, Russell. Hey.</i>

03:42.401 --> 03:43.034
<i>Russell, hey!</i>

03:43.102 --> 03:44.068
<i>Hey, Jenny. How are you?</i>

03:44.136 --> 03:44.702
<i>How are you?</i>

03:44.770 --> 03:45.570
<i>Good to see you guys.</i>

03:45.638 --> 03:46.237
<i>Wow!</i>

03:46.305 --> 03:47.705
<i>Back from New York, huh?</i>

03:47.773 --> 03:49.941
<i>Yeah.
I tried it, I didn't like it.</i>

03:50.009 --> 03:51.509
<i>Too crowded, too
many crazy people.</i>

03:51.577 --> 03:53.544
<i>What's Taco doing
in the Dumpster?</i>

03:53.612 --> 03:54.412
<i>Howdy, Russell.</i>

03:54.480 --> 03:55.380
<i>Like my new hat?</i>

03:55.447 --> 03:57.849
<i>Yeah. A homeless guy threw
that away two days ago.</i>

03:57.916 --> 03:58.750
<i>Well, his loss.</i>

03:58.817 --> 04:00.685
<i>Hey, you need anything
while I'm in here?</i>

04:00.753 --> 04:01.886
<i>Shoe? Part of a cat?</i>

04:01.954 --> 04:03.588
<i>No, no, I'm all
good on cat parts.</i>

04:03.656 --> 04:04.589
<i>All right.</i>

04:04.657 --> 04:09.127
<i>>></i>

04:09.194 --> 04:10.094
<i>I see him at the grocery store.</i>

04:10.162 --> 04:10.895
<i>Let me ask you a question.</i>

04:10.963 --> 04:12.230
<i>What is going on
with his clothes?</i>

04:12.298 --> 04:13.698
<i>Uh...
It's out of control.</i>

04:13.766 --> 04:15.199
<i>He looks like a
roller-blading instructor.</i>

04:15.267 --> 04:16.134
<i>I know. It's a nightmare.</i>

04:16.201 --> 04:17.067
<i>Yeah, it's embarrassing.</i>

04:17.136 --> 04:18.870
<i>I would love to catch up
with you guys sometime.</i>

04:18.937 --> 04:20.404
<i>Absolutely.
We should have dinner or something.</i>

04:20.471 --> 04:21.072
<i>That would be great.</i>

04:21.140 --> 04:21.939
<i>Do I still have your info?</i>

04:22.007 --> 04:22.573
<i>Is this you guys?</i>

04:22.641 --> 04:23.207
<i>BOTH: Uh, yeah.</i>

04:23.275 --> 04:23.808
<i>That's it.</i>

04:23.876 --> 04:24.442
<i>Cool.</i>

04:24.510 --> 04:25.476
<i>Give us a call.</i>

04:25.544 --> 04:26.544
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

04:26.612 --> 04:27.245
<i>Sorry?</i>

04:27.313 --> 04:28.579
<i>I thought I heard Velcro.</i>

04:28.647 --> 04:29.981
<i>Nothing. I gotta go.</i>

04:30.049 --> 04:31.482
<i>It's great to see you guys.</i>

04:31.550 --> 04:32.417
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:32.484 --> 04:34.152
<i>Taco, be careful.</i>

04:34.219 --> 04:35.486
<i>Lot of bad stuff in there.</i>

04:35.554 --> 04:36.954
<i>Oh, a lot of good stuff.</i>

04:37.022 --> 04:40.091
<i>Hey, I got a hat, I got some
tape, I got a sweatshirt and</i>

04:40.159 --> 04:42.293
<i>a brand-new toilet seat.</i>

04:42.361 --> 04:43.628
<i>I really needed this.</i>

04:43.696 --> 04:45.596
<i>What happened to your old one?</i>

04:45.664 --> 04:47.965
<i>There's no old one.</i>

04:50.069 --> 04:53.171
<i>Hey, Jenny and I ran into your
buddy Russell who I guess</i>

04:53.238 --> 04:54.339
<i>is back from New York.</i>

04:54.406 --> 04:57.909
<i>Yes, here's a little dirt for
you: Russell is a sex addict.</i>

04:57.976 --> 04:58.910
<i>No, he's not.</i>

04:58.977 --> 05:00.011
<i>Yeah, big-time.</i>

05:00.079 --> 05:01.112
<i>That's a tough disease.</i>

05:01.180 --> 05:02.113
<i>There's no such thing.</i>

05:02.181 --> 05:04.182
<i>It's a problem of the
privileged man.</i>

05:04.249 --> 05:05.183
<i>It's all about opportunity.</i>

05:05.250 --> 05:08.820
<i>You don't see janitors running
around being, like, "Oh, God, I</i>

05:08.887 --> 05:10.922
<i>"can't stop tapping
all this ass!"</i>

05:10.989 --> 05:13.191
<i>How much sex do you need
to have before you know</i>

05:13.258 --> 05:13.958
<i>you're an addict?</i>

05:14.026 --> 05:16.627
<i>Guys, you're making fun
of a serious condition.</i>

05:16.695 --> 05:18.796
<i>The guy's just good
at what he does.</i>

05:18.864 --> 05:19.831
<i>He's not an addict.</i>

05:19.898 --> 05:20.932
<i>He's-he's accomplished.</i>

05:20.999 --> 05:23.267
<i>Yeah, sex addicts are just guys
who are telling the truth.</i>

05:23.335 --> 05:26.604
<i>"Yes, I would like to tap that
and I would like to tap that</i>

05:26.672 --> 05:28.139
<i>and I will tap that eventually."</i>

05:28.207 --> 05:29.474
<i>You're such a romantic.</i>

05:29.541 --> 05:30.441
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

05:30.509 --> 05:32.944
<i>Guys, we got to talk about
this fake fight situation if</i>

05:33.011 --> 05:33.945
<i>we're gonna pull this off.</i>

05:34.012 --> 05:34.746
<i>I'm in.</i>

05:34.813 --> 05:35.613
<i>Yeah, I can't do it.</i>

05:35.681 --> 05:37.482
<i>I gotta keep my hands
clean on this one.</i>

05:37.549 --> 05:38.950
<i>Too much rage in these puppies.</i>

05:39.017 --> 05:40.818
<i>Yeah, I didn't bring
my stun gun.</i>

05:40.886 --> 05:41.886
<i>I don't fight without it.</i>

05:41.954 --> 05:42.754
<i>Anyone else need a drink?</i>

05:42.821 --> 05:44.222
<i>I'm gonna get...
Yeah.</i>

05:44.289 --> 05:44.922
<i>No, we're good.</i>

05:44.990 --> 05:45.790
<i>Know what that means?</i>

05:45.858 --> 05:47.725
<i>Me and you, mano a mano.</i>

05:47.793 --> 05:51.462
Former champion, reigning champion
together on the gridiron.

05:51.530 --> 05:53.564
You seem a little fidgety, man.

05:53.632 --> 05:54.399
You all right?

05:54.466 --> 05:55.400
Yeah, I'm okay.

05:55.467 --> 05:56.334
Just feel a little weird.

05:56.402 --> 05:59.804
Hey, just want to talk to you about this
trade I was thinking about between us.

05:59.872 --> 06:00.772
Okay, let's do it.

06:00.839 --> 06:01.672
Great!

06:01.740 --> 06:02.607
I don't need details.

06:02.674 --> 06:03.341
All right.

06:03.409 --> 06:03.975
You know what?

06:04.042 --> 06:05.076
I think I have to go.

06:05.144 --> 06:06.444
I have to go to the bathroom.

06:06.512 --> 06:07.912
> Okay, you can use the bathroom here.

06:07.980 --> 06:09.013
I don't like them here.

06:09.081 --> 06:11.182
I don't like getting too far
away from my toilet seat.

06:11.250 --> 06:12.283
You know what? I hear ya.

06:12.351 --> 06:15.686
My wife doesn't let me do the serious
stuff at home, so I do it at the office.

06:15.754 --> 06:16.788
The weekends are the hardest.

06:16.855 --> 06:19.357
Just so you know, when I'm out
there, I'm not gonna pull

06:19.425 --> 06:26.664
any punches 'cause Andre goes
two speeds: fast and furious.

06:26.732 --> 06:29.834
All right, don't do that in the fake
fight 'cause that looks really fake.

06:29.902 --> 06:31.035
We also need a safe word.

06:31.103 --> 06:33.304
Which is why I
suggest "fidelio."

06:33.372 --> 06:36.641
Fidelio? Where are you gonna work
fidelio organically into a fight?

06:36.708 --> 06:37.375
That's the trick.

06:37.443 --> 06:40.311
You need to pick a word
that doesn't seem organic.

06:40.379 --> 06:41.145
We'll do the trade.

06:41.213 --> 06:41.979
We'll talk about it.

06:42.047 --> 06:42.947
I have to go, okay?

06:43.015 --> 06:43.781
Okay, great.

06:43.849 --> 06:45.683
See ya. Hey, Raffle.

06:45.751 --> 06:47.185
He's here! Raffi's here.

06:47.252 --> 06:48.186
All right, let's go.

06:48.253 --> 06:49.020
Let's do this.

06:49.087 --> 06:49.821
<i>El Cu√±ado!</i>

06:49.888 --> 06:50.488
<i>El Cu√±ado!</i>

06:50.556 --> 06:51.889
<i>What's going on, buddy?</i>

06:51.957 --> 06:53.524
<i>I'm tired of your
nonsense, Andre!</i>

06:53.592 --> 06:55.827
<i>Don't walk away from me, Peter!</i>

06:55.894 --> 06:58.162
<i>I am fed up with you, man!</i>

06:58.230 --> 06:59.730
<i>Oh, it's a fight
between friends.</i>

06:59.798 --> 07:01.532
<i>Why don't we take this outside?</i>

07:01.600 --> 07:02.567
<i>What?</i>

07:02.634 --> 07:03.701
<i>The fight's going outside.</i>

07:03.769 --> 07:04.902
<i>Let's take it outside.</i>

07:04.970 --> 07:07.205
<i>In the street like dogs!</i>

07:07.272 --> 07:08.072
<i>Fight!</i>

07:08.140 --> 07:09.073
<i>Let's go, get it going.</i>

07:09.141 --> 07:10.007
<i>Okay.</i>

07:10.075 --> 07:10.842
<i>All right.</i>

07:10.909 --> 07:11.843
<i>Let's get... where were we?</i>

07:11.910 --> 07:12.844
<i>You suck!</i>

07:12.911 --> 07:13.711
<i>You suck.</i>

07:13.779 --> 07:14.545
<i>Throw him a punch.</i>

07:14.613 --> 07:15.379
<i>Get in there.</i>

07:15.447 --> 07:16.214
<i>Get personal!</i>

07:16.281 --> 07:17.215
<i>Bite each other's dicks off!</i>

07:17.282 --> 07:19.183
<i>Why don't you ever listen to
my messages when I call you?</i>

07:19.251 --> 07:20.985
<i>Well, you leave, like,
four-minute messages.</i>

07:21.053 --> 07:22.987
<i>Sometimes I say funny
stuff on them.</i>

07:23.055 --> 07:23.855
<i>Less slapping!</i>

07:23.922 --> 07:24.689
<i>No, you don't.</i>

07:24.756 --> 07:26.924
<i>I will call you back or listen
to a message, but not both.</i>

07:26.992 --> 07:27.992
<i>Guys, dive for the knife!</i>

07:28.060 --> 07:28.826
<i>(knife clatters on ground)</i>

07:28.894 --> 07:31.262
<i>This is the kind of attitude
that makes you a loser.</i>

07:31.330 --> 07:32.497
<i>Geez, I'm trying to be nice.</i>

07:32.564 --> 07:33.331
<i>Relax.</i>

07:33.398 --> 07:35.099
<i>You don't have to
be nice to me.</i>

07:35.167 --> 07:36.033
<i>You're a failure in life.</i>

07:36.101 --> 07:37.168
<i>Your wife divorced you.</i>

07:37.236 --> 07:38.169
<i>You live in a studio apartment.</i>

07:38.237 --> 07:40.204
<i>Yeah, I'm a champion,
and you're a loser.</i>

07:40.272 --> 07:41.405
<i>Oh.</i>

07:41.473 --> 07:42.673
<i>I'm a loser?</i>

07:42.741 --> 07:44.942
<i>You make six figures, you
can't buy good taste, Andre.</i>

07:45.010 --> 07:46.744
<i>Look at your outfit.</i>

07:46.812 --> 07:49.213
<i>And that goddamn
Klumberg painting.</i>

07:49.281 --> 07:51.716
<i>Jesus, I should draw
veins on that thing.</i>

07:51.783 --> 07:55.586
<i>You have worse taste
than El Cu√±ado.</i>

07:55.654 --> 07:57.121
<i>(Andre yells)</i>

07:57.189 --> 07:58.222
<i>Ow, wow!</i>

07:58.290 --> 07:59.423
<i>Finish him!</i>

07:59.491 --> 08:00.258
<i>Guys, hey.</i>

08:00.325 --> 08:01.092
<i>Get off each other.</i>

08:01.159 --> 08:01.959
<i>All right, we get it.</i>

08:02.027 --> 08:02.793
<i>Fidelio!</i>

08:02.861 --> 08:05.196
<i>Fidelio.</i>

08:05.264 --> 08:06.464
<i>Fine. You know what?</i>

08:06.532 --> 08:07.698
<i>Keep this league.</i>

08:07.766 --> 08:08.766
<i>I quit.</i>

08:08.834 --> 08:10.201
<i>Enjoy your league.</i>

08:10.269 --> 08:12.370
<i>Have a great time.</i>

08:12.437 --> 08:15.106
<i>Guys, how are we going
to get Andre back?</i>

08:15.173 --> 08:18.109
<i>We are all best friends.</i>

08:18.176 --> 08:21.112
<i>But, honestly, if he doesn't
come back, I know a guy, Dirty</i>

08:21.179 --> 08:23.414
<i>Randy, who can join the league.</i>

08:23.482 --> 08:25.917
<i>Truth be told, he's
kind of an asshole.</i>

08:25.984 --> 08:28.386
<i>Bring it in.</i>

08:28.453 --> 08:30.388
<i>Bring it in, guys.</i>

08:33.219 --> 08:34.419
Oh, Raffi's the worst.

08:34.486 --> 08:36.421
He's like a cockroach with a beard.

08:36.489 --> 08:39.256
You know, we should have just put you
in the league from the very beginning.

08:39.325 --> 08:40.125
We made a huge mistake.

08:40.193 --> 08:41.159
But you didn't.

08:41.227 --> 08:42.594
It's okay.

08:42.662 --> 08:43.729
I'm good.

08:43.796 --> 08:45.430
What do you mean, you're good?

08:45.498 --> 08:47.165
I'm in a league now, and I'm good.

08:47.233 --> 08:47.999
What league are you in?

08:48.067 --> 08:49.067
I'm in Russell's league.

08:49.135 --> 08:50.969
You cannot be in a
league with Russell.

08:51.037 --> 08:51.903
Why? He called the other day.

08:51.971 --> 08:52.771
They needed an extra person.

08:52.839 --> 08:53.605
We were talking.

08:53.673 --> 08:54.606
He asked me if I could do it.

08:54.674 --> 08:56.341
Jenny, Russell is a sex addict.

08:56.409 --> 08:58.243
There is no such thing
as a sex addict.

08:58.311 --> 08:59.111
There's just guys.

08:59.178 --> 09:01.246
Yes, guys who want to
sleep with everything.

09:01.314 --> 09:02.247
Yeah, guys.

09:02.315 --> 09:04.416
This guy is perverted, all right?

09:04.484 --> 09:05.650
Who starts a league week three?

09:05.718 --> 09:06.818
Whatever. I'll figure it out.

09:06.886 --> 09:08.854
We're going over there tonight
for the draft, and I'm excited.

09:08.921 --> 09:12.524
Jenny, I don't want you to be in a
league with Russell, the sex machine.

09:12.592 --> 09:14.192
I want you to be in a league with me.

09:14.260 --> 09:15.026
Really?

09:15.094 --> 09:15.861
Really.

09:15.928 --> 09:20.432
Well, it didn't sound like
that in Vegas, did it?

09:20.500 --> 09:21.666
Taco!

09:21.734 --> 09:23.869
Hey, I'm here to make that trade.

09:23.936 --> 09:24.803
You want to do it?

09:24.871 --> 09:26.304
Yeah, I'm back here!

09:26.372 --> 09:28.507
I tried calling you,
but you didn't answer.

09:28.574 --> 09:31.777
Yeah, I forgot the phone in the
living room about four hours ago.

09:31.844 --> 09:34.112
Well, you, uh, ready to get this...
Oh!

09:34.180 --> 09:35.147
Hey, Ruxin.

09:35.214 --> 09:37.616
Why didn't you tell me this
was the bathroom, Taco?

09:37.683 --> 09:38.550
How's it going?

09:38.618 --> 09:39.384
I'm fine.

09:39.452 --> 09:40.485
Sorry. It's just been busy.

09:40.553 --> 09:41.386
Doing some work.

09:41.454 --> 09:42.387
Uh, I can come back later.

09:42.455 --> 09:44.322
Oh, I'm going to be here all day.

09:44.357 --> 09:45.123
Putting together a puzzle.

09:45.191 --> 09:46.158
Painting a picture.

09:46.225 --> 09:47.159
Putting together a puzzle.

09:47.226 --> 09:48.026
Painting a picture.

09:48.094 --> 09:49.694
You are painting quite a picture.

09:49.762 --> 09:50.529
Okay.

09:50.596 --> 09:52.197
Where do you think this should go?

09:52.265 --> 09:53.932
This way, this way, this
way, this way or this way?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.801
Well, I'm going to leave,
and I'm never going to come

09:55.868 --> 09:57.536
back, and I'm going to
burn these clothes.

09:57.603 --> 09:58.370
Okay.

09:58.437 --> 09:59.204
See you later.

09:59.272 --> 10:00.305
Okay.

10:00.373 --> 10:02.874
I haven't spoken to
Andre in a couple days.

10:02.942 --> 10:05.811
Yeah, well, he was upset, so...
Well, I wonder why.

10:05.878 --> 10:07.479
You went too far in the fake fight.

10:07.547 --> 10:08.313
Mm-hmm.

10:08.381 --> 10:10.182
He doesn't understand
pretend... I can't help that.

10:10.249 --> 10:11.683
You have to apologize to him.

10:11.751 --> 10:12.517
I'm sorry.

10:12.585 --> 10:14.352
Why do I have to give a real
apology for a fake fight?

10:14.420 --> 10:16.021
You don't have to apologize, Pete.

10:16.088 --> 10:17.689
Just tell him that you
like the painting.

10:17.757 --> 10:19.357
Yeah, tell him you like the Klumberg.

10:19.425 --> 10:21.026
Can we just do something easier?

10:21.093 --> 10:22.694
Can you just shoot me
in the face, please?

10:22.762 --> 10:24.362
No, we talked about that possibility.

10:24.430 --> 10:26.998
Yeah, we'd still be a man down, and
a six-man league is just pathetic.

10:27.066 --> 10:28.667
Yeah, that's a good point, actually.

10:28.734 --> 10:34.639
We cannot let a fake fight
destroy the league for real.

10:34.640 --> 10:35.373
Has anyone seen Taco?

10:35.441 --> 10:37.475
He was supposed to come over to
my house for dinner last night,

10:37.543 --> 10:38.310
never showed up.

10:38.377 --> 10:39.177
I did see your brother.

10:39.245 --> 10:42.647
I went to his apartment, and I literally
could not pry him off the toilet seat.

10:42.715 --> 10:44.516
He sat there the whole time...
Was he sick?

10:44.584 --> 10:45.350
No, he was fine.

10:45.418 --> 10:46.251
In fact, he was engaged.

10:46.319 --> 10:47.085
He was sharp.

10:47.153 --> 10:49.721
It was like he was working
on another level.

10:49.789 --> 10:50.722
Oh, my God.

10:50.790 --> 10:53.391
We had this case down
at the DA's office.

10:53.459 --> 10:57.495
These guys are smuggling in
cocaine molded into toilet seats.

10:57.563 --> 11:00.599
The other day, I saw Taco
rummaging through a-a Dumpster,

11:00.666 --> 11:02.500
and he pulled out a toilet seat.

11:02.568 --> 11:06.404
So Taco is basically addicted
to sitting on the toilet.

11:06.472 --> 11:07.505
Sorry.

11:07.573 --> 11:08.740
(laughing)

11:08.808 --> 11:10.342
This is great, you know?

11:10.409 --> 11:14.012
I got a sex addict trying to plow my
wife, and my brother's Pablo Escobar.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.448
Cheers to you, buddy.

11:16.515 --> 11:20.051
So I just kind of want to formally
apologize for the fake fight.

11:20.119 --> 11:21.119
A lot of things were said.

11:21.187 --> 11:23.221
Mean, hurtful things were said.

11:23.289 --> 11:24.289
Yeah, but that was for Raffi.

11:24.357 --> 11:26.124
I mean, you don't have bad taste.

11:26.192 --> 11:28.627
In fact, you have excellent taste.

11:28.694 --> 11:29.861
So you really like it?

11:29.929 --> 11:31.563
Andre, I don't like it.

11:31.631 --> 11:33.465
I think I love it.

11:33.532 --> 11:35.100
See? I knew it!

11:35.167 --> 11:37.903
So you and I have the same
taste, but, you know, we can't

11:37.970 --> 11:40.472
go around saying everything
when the guys are over.

11:40.539 --> 11:43.108
You know, it embarrasses them,
you know, that we have that.

11:43.175 --> 11:43.942
Yeah.

11:44.010 --> 11:47.045
And I'll tell you one other thing about
this... it is great with the ladies.

11:47.113 --> 11:48.813
Ladies love the Klumberg, huh?

11:48.881 --> 11:51.549
<i>Oh, nothing says
erotique like Klumberg.</i>

11:51.617 --> 11:53.618
<i>You know, you can
borrow it if you want.</i>

11:53.686 --> 11:54.753
<i>I could not borrow this.</i>

11:54.820 --> 11:57.122
<i>I mean, this...
I couldn't do it to you.</i>

11:57.189 --> 11:58.957
<i>Charms the pants
off the ladies.</i>

11:59.025 --> 12:01.259
<i>So we're friends again and...
Yes, we're friends, because</i>

12:01.327 --> 12:02.327
<i>we get it.</i>

12:02.395 --> 12:03.161
<i>Okay.</i>

12:03.229 --> 12:04.963
<i>And you're back in the
league and we're all good?</i>

12:05.031 --> 12:06.898
<i>Yes, but under one condition.</i>

12:06.966 --> 12:07.966
<i>No.</i>

12:08.034 --> 12:08.967
<i>Okay, I'm in.</i>

12:09.035 --> 12:09.634
<i>All right.</i>

12:09.702 --> 12:10.435
<i>We'll see you later.</i>

12:10.503 --> 12:11.069
<i>Later.</i>

12:11.137 --> 12:13.271
<i>My bro!</i>

12:18.182 --> 12:19.115
Hey, guys.

12:19.183 --> 12:20.784
<i>All right, let's put
Time Cop in.</i>

12:20.851 --> 12:21.785
I got to be home in two hours.

12:21.852 --> 12:22.619
No, no, no.

12:22.686 --> 12:23.453
<i>No Time Cop, Taco.</i>

12:23.521 --> 12:24.421
This is an intervention.

12:24.488 --> 12:25.255
What?

12:25.322 --> 12:26.923
No, smoking pot's not illegal.

12:26.991 --> 12:29.959
Actually, it is, but that's
not why we called you here.

12:30.027 --> 12:30.894
What?

12:30.961 --> 12:31.761
I made hummus.

12:31.829 --> 12:33.329
Guys, I don't have a problem.

12:33.397 --> 12:35.231
I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

12:35.299 --> 12:37.333
Taco, you're holding
on to a toilet seat.

12:37.401 --> 12:38.301
You don't understand.

12:38.369 --> 12:39.235
It's just so comfortable.

12:39.303 --> 12:41.838
You just sit on it, and you're
like, "Wow, I could do anything."

12:41.906 --> 12:44.574
Well, I mean, anything you
could do sitting on a toilet.

12:44.642 --> 12:47.444
The reason you feel that way
is because that toilet seat is

12:47.511 --> 12:55.418
made out of cocaine.
We're all - help you get over this... and one

12:55.486 --> 12:58.655
of the ways that I've tried to
help tonight is to make this

12:58.722 --> 13:01.090
hummus for you and...
Would you like to try this?

13:01.158 --> 13:03.092
I'm really not hungry right now.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.060
Okay, well, it's very good.

13:04.128 --> 13:05.728
Look, you need help, all right?

13:05.796 --> 13:06.563
This is it.

13:06.630 --> 13:08.398
Guys, it's just that when I sit
on this thing, I feel like

13:08.466 --> 13:10.400
the smartest, most powerful
person in the entire bathroom.

13:10.468 --> 13:12.735
You know what, let me...
let me deal with this as a doctor.

13:12.803 --> 13:19.142
Taco, cocaine is a drug
that's very, very addictive.

13:19.210 --> 13:22.078
Everything you just said, I could have
said, even though I'm not a doctor.

13:22.146 --> 13:23.112
Yeah, he talks really slow.

13:23.180 --> 13:23.980
Could you talk, please?

13:24.048 --> 13:26.282
Will you make a pledge to us
that you will try to get better?

13:26.350 --> 13:27.283
Yes.

13:27.351 --> 13:30.420
And will you make a pledge to us
that you will try this hummus?

13:30.488 --> 13:31.488
Stop with the hummus, Andre!

13:31.555 --> 13:32.722
I'm done with it, okay?

13:32.790 --> 13:33.556
It's good.

13:33.624 --> 13:35.625
What, you think you
reinvented the hummus wheel?

13:35.693 --> 13:36.493
I might have.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.394
Really, you smashed the
chickpeas yourself?

13:38.462 --> 13:39.429
I mixed two recipes.

13:39.497 --> 13:40.330
"Oh, look at me!

13:40.397 --> 13:41.164
I'm Chef Vitaly!"

13:41.232 --> 13:41.998
Oh, you know what?

13:42.066 --> 13:42.899
Oh, what... what do I know?

13:42.967 --> 13:44.801
You going to try to tell me
that this is more important...

13:44.869 --> 13:45.835
Down, down, down, down.

13:45.903 --> 13:46.936
Okay, all right, fine.

13:47.004 --> 13:47.770
Guys, guys!

13:47.838 --> 13:49.672
Let's keep our eyes on the
prize here, all right?

13:49.740 --> 13:51.574
There's a man sitting here with
a toilet seat under his shirt.

13:51.642 --> 13:53.076
No, no, no, I threw it away.

13:53.143 --> 13:55.278
Taco, take it out.

13:55.346 --> 13:56.779
You're done.

13:56.847 --> 13:58.815
You're not walking out of
here with that toilet seat.

13:58.883 --> 13:59.649
Hand it over.

13:59.717 --> 14:00.483
All right.

14:00.551 --> 14:01.317
Time to give it up.

14:01.385 --> 14:02.151
Okay, fine.

14:02.219 --> 14:03.019
Can I just have one last hit?

14:03.087 --> 14:03.753
Please?

14:03.821 --> 14:05.488
As a doctor...
Shut up.

14:05.556 --> 14:06.489
You can have one more.

14:06.557 --> 14:07.957
Will you stop saying...
Two minutes.

14:08.025 --> 14:08.791
Thank you.

14:08.859 --> 14:09.659
This is my sweet place.

14:09.727 --> 14:10.527
Oh, it's awesome.

14:10.594 --> 14:11.461
I love it.

14:11.529 --> 14:12.495
It's really nice, right?

14:12.563 --> 14:13.463
It's really great.

14:13.531 --> 14:14.197
Thank you.

14:14.265 --> 14:16.466
Um, where is everyone for the draft?

14:16.534 --> 14:18.334
I told them to come in, like, an hour.

14:18.402 --> 14:19.469
Did you not get my texts?

14:19.537 --> 14:21.604
No, Russell, I did not get your texts.

14:21.672 --> 14:22.705
Well, I'm sorry.

14:22.773 --> 14:24.040
But I'm glad you're here.

14:24.108 --> 14:30.880
Listen, the thing is, is I know what
you are going through right now...

14:30.948 --> 14:32.482
I'm a sex addict... you can say it.

14:32.550 --> 14:34.984
Let me know if there's anything
that I'm doing that is,

14:35.052 --> 14:37.887
like, I don't know,
making it difficult.

14:37.955 --> 14:39.022
Oh, no.

14:39.089 --> 14:41.057
You're worried that you're
going to trigger my addiction?

14:41.125 --> 14:43.993
Yeah, just, you know, is there
anything that I shouldn't be doing?

14:44.061 --> 14:45.562
It's not going to be a problem.

14:45.629 --> 14:47.297
Uh, I don't see you that way.

14:47.364 --> 14:48.565
What does that mean?

14:48.632 --> 14:50.833
You can't turn me on sexually.

14:50.901 --> 14:52.135
Is it because I'm married?

14:52.202 --> 14:54.737
No. No, I have sex with
a ton of married women.

14:54.805 --> 14:55.538
A lot.

14:55.606 --> 14:56.506
Today even.

14:56.574 --> 14:58.741
Well, what...
I mean I don't understand what it is.

14:58.809 --> 15:00.843
Like, this doesn't do it for you?

15:00.911 --> 15:03.246
What?

15:03.314 --> 15:04.881
(Jenny giggles)

15:04.949 --> 15:11.821
If I don't trigger your
addiction, what does?

15:11.889 --> 15:14.324
Oh, I mean how much time do you have?

15:14.391 --> 15:17.760
Birthday parties for old people,
fresh bought corn, marbles, you

15:17.828 --> 15:22.498
know... just when I see, like, a room
full of marbles, which is very re, um...

15:22.566 --> 15:26.169
Corduroy's... vut-vut-vut... ejaculate.

15:26.236 --> 15:28.338
But me sitting right here...
No.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.573
...alone in your apartment,
does nothing for you?

15:30.641 --> 15:31.574
These tiny tomatoes.

15:31.642 --> 15:34.310
I bought these not realizing...
huge trigger for me.

15:34.378 --> 15:38.815
A tiny tomato does it for you
and I sit here doing nothing?

15:38.882 --> 15:41.351
Open your mouth for just a second.

15:41.418 --> 15:42.685
No.

15:42.753 --> 15:45.154
But this little guy.

15:45.222 --> 15:47.223
Oh, man.

15:47.291 --> 15:49.592
Oh, try one of these strawberries.

15:49.660 --> 15:51.160
Would that do it for you if I was...?

15:51.228 --> 15:51.861
Maybe, maybe.

15:51.929 --> 15:52.495
Eat it.

15:52.563 --> 15:53.262
Just eat it?

15:53.330 --> 15:54.597
Yeah, in a slutty way.

15:54.665 --> 15:56.332
Eat that slutty strawberry.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.201
What are you doing?

15:58.268 --> 15:59.235
I don't know.

15:59.303 --> 16:01.104
You're going to choke on that.

16:01.171 --> 16:02.338
This is how you eat it.

16:02.406 --> 16:04.240
Hello, little man.

16:04.308 --> 16:08.344
Oh...
Russell, that's awful.

16:08.412 --> 16:10.013
Like that.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.749
Oh, brother, now I got
myself all riled up.

16:12.816 --> 16:14.083
Oh, boy.

16:14.151 --> 16:15.284
I want to show you something.

16:15.352 --> 16:17.120
Some of the things I bought recently.

16:17.187 --> 16:18.087
What do these remind you of?

16:18.155 --> 16:19.122
Artichokes?

16:19.189 --> 16:22.125
No, the breasts of a...
alien.

16:22.192 --> 16:24.060
That you can also titty bang.

16:24.128 --> 16:24.894
No.

16:24.962 --> 16:26.596
Can we just talk about the draft?

16:26.664 --> 16:27.563
Draft not a trigger.

16:27.631 --> 16:28.931
You not a trigger.

16:28.999 --> 16:30.133
Whipped cream a trigger.

16:30.200 --> 16:30.967
Come here, bad boy.

16:31.035 --> 16:33.436
Oh, you know what...
Ah! Oh!

16:33.504 --> 16:35.238
It got all in my mouth.

16:35.305 --> 16:36.272
How did that happen?

16:36.340 --> 16:37.040
I don't know.

16:37.107 --> 16:37.740
(Russell laughs)

16:37.808 --> 16:38.875
(door opens, closes)

16:38.942 --> 16:41.377
Every day's a struggle.

16:41.445 --> 16:42.745
For real.

16:42.813 --> 16:44.213
The deed is done.

16:44.281 --> 16:45.448
Take this and bury it.

16:45.516 --> 16:46.282
No, no, no.

16:46.350 --> 16:47.150
No, no, no, no, no.

16:47.217 --> 16:47.917
Just put it on there.

16:47.985 --> 16:48.985
No, that's a nice pillow.

16:49.053 --> 16:50.787
Aw, not on the couch.

16:50.854 --> 16:52.455
Relax.

16:52.523 --> 16:53.956
Party people!

16:54.024 --> 16:55.591
Whoo!

16:55.659 --> 16:57.160
Lemons and pita.

16:57.227 --> 16:58.494
What are you doing?

16:58.562 --> 16:59.495
Raffi, get up.

16:59.563 --> 17:01.164
You smooshed the lemon on the floor.

17:01.231 --> 17:02.165
I smooshed the lemon.

17:02.232 --> 17:02.999
I smooshed the lemon.

17:03.067 --> 17:04.934
Oh, my God, it's so
good to see you guys.

17:05.002 --> 17:06.502
I missed you guys.

17:06.569 --> 17:09.605
I'm gonna go crap the booze out
and then me and my bros are

17:09.673 --> 17:13.076
going to hang out for
the rest of our lives.

17:13.143 --> 17:14.609
Get in there, Raffi.

17:14.678 --> 17:16.345
Why are you bringing him here?

17:16.413 --> 17:18.580
What I'm doing is saving the league.

17:18.648 --> 17:21.017
I have been getting
Raffi hammered tonight.

17:21.085 --> 17:27.156
And tomorrow morning
when he horrible things.

17:27.223 --> 17:28.691
And then we kick him
out of the league.

17:28.759 --> 17:29.325
I like it.

17:29.393 --> 17:30.860
That's kind of brilliant actually.

17:30.928 --> 17:31.627
Yeah.

17:31.695 --> 17:34.097
(retching)

17:34.164 --> 17:36.165
What is this?

17:36.233 --> 17:37.800
(sniffs)

17:37.868 --> 17:40.603
What?

17:40.671 --> 17:42.038
(sniffs)

17:42.106 --> 17:43.039
Hey!

17:43.107 --> 17:44.107
Oh, boy.

17:44.174 --> 17:45.641
We got to stick to what we know.

17:45.709 --> 17:46.275
Yes.

17:46.343 --> 17:48.177
We smash up Andre's place and
we tell Raffi he did it.

17:48.245 --> 17:50.113
Yeah, we take a dump in his bed.

17:50.180 --> 17:52.281
Yeah, we take this table and
we whip it out the window.

17:52.349 --> 17:53.015
I'm right here.

17:53.083 --> 17:55.718
Yeah, we take the hummus and
just put it all up in his couch.

17:55.786 --> 17:56.352
No.

17:56.420 --> 17:58.721
All right, I say this could be fun.

17:58.789 --> 17:59.355
Whoa!

17:59.423 --> 18:02.825
You guys, you guys, okay, what if tonight
we all went out and got matching

18:02.893 --> 18:03.793
tattoos?!

18:03.861 --> 18:05.294
Hang on. I'll be right back.

18:05.362 --> 18:06.395
Hang on! Don't move!

18:06.463 --> 18:07.063
Uh-oh.

18:07.131 --> 18:07.864
What uh-oh?

18:07.931 --> 18:10.800
I sort of switched the cocaine
seat with Andre's seat.

18:10.868 --> 18:11.701
Oh, goddamn it, Taco!

18:11.769 --> 18:15.805
Sorry. I wanted to be able to come
back any time and just sit on it.

18:15.873 --> 18:16.873
How often are you here?

18:16.940 --> 18:18.007
When you're at work.

18:18.075 --> 18:19.909
You guys, you guys...
Whoa! (all exclaim)

18:19.977 --> 18:21.010
Just one second! Lookit!

18:21.078 --> 18:21.978
Be careful.

18:22.045 --> 18:24.847
This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen in my life!

18:24.915 --> 18:25.515
Thank you.

18:25.582 --> 18:26.382
You're welcome, Andre.

18:26.450 --> 18:27.583
You guys are beautiful, too!

18:27.651 --> 18:29.352
And the friendship we
have is beautiful.

18:29.419 --> 18:30.753
I would do anything for you guys.

18:30.821 --> 18:34.824
You know, I am not gonna let
that dirty sex addict do to

18:34.892 --> 18:39.362
Jenny what this penis bird
has done to butt mountain.

18:39.429 --> 18:40.530
It's not a penis bird!

18:40.597 --> 18:41.430
Yes, it is!

18:41.498 --> 18:44.233
ALL: No!

18:44.301 --> 18:48.271
(Peter laughs)

18:48.338 --> 18:50.940
Suck it!
I'm outta here, bitches!

18:51.008 --> 18:51.941
Whoo!

18:52.009 --> 18:53.342
Where is he going?

18:53.410 --> 18:56.112
Let's go. Let's go.

18:56.180 --> 18:57.280
Raffi?

18:57.347 --> 18:59.015
Why are we looking for this guy?

18:59.082 --> 18:59.916
He wrecked my painting.

18:59.983 --> 19:03.219
We may want him out of the league,
but we don't want him dead.

19:03.287 --> 19:04.453
Ah, I'm fine either way.

19:04.521 --> 19:06.522
Oh, my God, this is Russell's car.

19:06.590 --> 19:09.959
I swear to God, if he touches
Jenny, I will rip his face off.

19:10.027 --> 19:10.726
Jenny!

19:10.794 --> 19:12.361
Ha-ha!

19:12.429 --> 19:13.129
(Russell groans)

19:13.197 --> 19:14.564
Oh, God, Raffi.

19:14.631 --> 19:16.199
Guys, I found a new trigger:

19:16.266 --> 19:18.100
it's cocaine in a man's beard.

19:18.168 --> 19:20.736
Wow. I guess Russell
really is a sex addict.

19:20.804 --> 19:22.905
Hey, Andre, it looks
like your painting.

19:22.973 --> 19:24.140
Bad news, bros.

19:24.208 --> 19:25.441
I'm totally quitting the league.

19:25.509 --> 19:26.442
Russell's got a 12-team league.

19:26.510 --> 19:27.410
12 teams is where it's at.

19:27.477 --> 19:28.044
Yeah.

19:28.111 --> 19:28.644
Right? Right?

19:28.712 --> 19:29.278
Yeah. Yeah.

19:29.346 --> 19:29.912
Right?

19:29.980 --> 19:30.546
Yeah.

19:30.614 --> 19:31.147
Right? Right?

19:31.215 --> 19:31.981
Yeah.

19:32.049 --> 19:32.815
Right? Right? Right? Right?

19:32.883 --> 19:34.250
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

19:34.318 --> 19:37.119
Some things you can't unsee, bro.

19:43.153 --> 19:44.687
We're not at a rave, Taco.

19:44.754 --> 19:46.922
Enter initiate, please.

19:46.990 --> 19:54.163
I made brownies...
No.

19:54.230 --> 19:55.097
Stand.

19:55.165 --> 19:58.400
No, I think I will sit
and just be comfortable.

19:58.468 --> 19:59.902
Sit comfortably!

19:59.970 --> 20:00.869
Thanks.

20:00.937 --> 20:02.204
Wait. That's all the hazing?

20:02.272 --> 20:03.939
You guys hazed me for two weeks.

20:04.007 --> 20:06.275
I'm still finding pieces of
squid all over my apartment.

20:06.343 --> 20:11.780
So, due to last night's circumstances,
Raffi has decided to leave the league.

20:11.848 --> 20:13.882
So we welcome a new member.

20:13.950 --> 20:14.917
Welcome, sweetheart.

20:14.985 --> 20:16.185
"Sweetheart"? No.

20:16.252 --> 20:17.119
That's all she gets?

20:17.187 --> 20:18.854
You guys called me "dick cream"

20:18.922 --> 20:19.555
for two years.

20:19.623 --> 20:20.723
You want dick cream back?

20:20.790 --> 20:24.760
No. I want to be called Andre,
Dre, D-Man, all right?

20:24.828 --> 20:28.464
So, guys, Raffi left me with,
like, a roster of total crap,

20:28.531 --> 20:31.133
and I was thinking that maybe
we could just redraft.

20:31.201 --> 20:32.301
ALL: No!

20:32.369 --> 20:34.703
No, no, no, you're on your own now.

20:34.771 --> 20:38.374
Welcome to the league.

20:42.712 --> 20:45.247
All right, I accept the challenge.

20:45.315 --> 20:48.384
And I will take this donkey
of a team and I'm gonna turn

20:48.451 --> 20:50.285
it into a champion, dick cream.

20:50.353 --> 20:51.420
(all laugh)

20:51.488 --> 20:53.155
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

20:53.223 --> 20:53.822
No dick cream.

20:53.890 --> 20:55.290
But just FYI, you guys.

20:55.358 --> 20:56.857
You know you're buddy Russell?
Not a sex addict.
