Is there a problem,
Officer Swimsuit?

01:22.990 --> 01:25.500
Uh, sir, a number of our
guests are concerned

01:25.500 --> 01:28.250
that maybe you’re
getting too much sun.

01:28.250 --> 01:30.370
Are you aware of the dangers
of melanoma?

I warned you, you little jamook.

Now I’m gonna rip off your arms

Oh!

Danny. How you doing, kid?

01:53.580 --> 01:55.410
Hey. Give me some sugar.
Uncle Vito.

01:55.410 --> 01:56.990
Whoa. You got grease
on you. You look like

01:56.990 --> 01:58.830
a half-baked Butterball.
I don’t want to touch you.

01:58.830 --> 01:59.910
Well, I’m sorry
you had to hear that.

Yeah, well...
Who’s this guy?

This-this is Steve.
This is my partner.

02:07.290 --> 02:08.990
Steve, it’s my Uncle Vito.
Nice to meet you.

02:08.990 --> 02:10.620
Nice to meet you.
Hey, some grip here. Whoa.

02:10.620 --> 02:11.830
Hey, Danny’s told
me a lot about you.

02:11.830 --> 02:15.660
Yeah, as long as he didn’t tell
you where the bodies are buried.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.700
That’s a joke.

02:17.700 --> 02:18.790
I never killed nobody.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.450
And if I did,
he’d never tell.

02:20.450 --> 02:21.990
That’s, uh... that’s,
uh, Jersey humor.

02:21.990 --> 02:25.540
Oh, okay. Vito, listen, we
really appreciate you, uh,

02:25.540 --> 02:26.620
flying all this way to help us

02:26.620 --> 02:27.990
get this restaurant
up and running.

02:27.990 --> 02:28.750
Thank you.
Yeah.

02:28.750 --> 02:30.750
I hear it’s been
a disaster for you two.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.620
Well, look, Danny says
you’re just the guy

02:32.620 --> 02:34.160
to get the train
back on the track.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.120
So, look, if
you’re done here,

02:35.120 --> 02:37.990
I was thinking maybe we could
swing you by the place,

02:37.990 --> 02:39.950
maybe get you started.
What do you say?
Yeah...

02:39.950 --> 02:42.160
Could you give me, uh...
like, another half an hour?

02:42.160 --> 02:45.200
You know, I gotta roast
this thing evenly.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.370
I’m just breaking your balls.

02:48.370 --> 02:49.290
Huh? Come on, you mutts.

02:49.290 --> 02:52.200
That’s Jersey
humor again, huh?

02:54.910 --> 02:56.500
Okay, I can
work with this.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.700
So, here’s what
we’re gonna do.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.290
We’re gonna punch some holes
into the sub wall,

03:01.290 --> 03:03.540
make it look like some rats
ate the wiring.

03:03.540 --> 03:06.620
So long as you let me do the
talking to the arson inspector,

03:06.620 --> 03:07.990
we can pull this off.

03:07.990 --> 03:09.040
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.910
What are you talking about,
arson inspector?

03:10.910 --> 03:12.660
He’s, uh...
he’s been

03:12.660 --> 03:13.910
in the sun all day.

03:13.910 --> 03:16.120
No, no, Vito, we don’t want you
to burn the joint down.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.990
We want you to help us finish
building it. You understand?

03:17.990 --> 03:21.000
Hey, I thought you guys want to
make some money on this venture.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.410
He’s joking with me, right?

03:22.410 --> 03:24.120
It’s a joke?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:24.120 --> 03:24.990
Huh
Son, look, look.

03:24.990 --> 03:28.120
90% of the restaurants
fail in the first year.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.370
And the ones that don’t
mostly go bust after that.

03:30.370 --> 03:33.410
It’s not a joke.
You’re better off buying
a lottery ticket.

03:33.410 --> 03:35.990
Okay, okay, why are you
making him crazy? Stop.

03:35.990 --> 03:37.450
All right,
you’re here to help us.

03:37.450 --> 03:38.990
Can we go on that
plan, please?

03:38.990 --> 03:40.290
Okay. It’s your heart attack.

03:40.290 --> 03:42.160
You-- I want
to talk to you.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.040
Okay.

03:44.990 --> 03:46.200
No, no, no, Danny.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.990
No, no, no.
Just relax.

03:47.990 --> 03:48.830
Relax, okay?

03:48.830 --> 03:50.990
He’s busting chops.
He’s just messing around.

03:50.990 --> 03:53.160
Only thing he’s gonna burn
is his epidermis, okay?

03:53.160 --> 03:55.540
He will get it done.
This is a bad idea.

03:55.540 --> 03:57.250
My bad idea synapse is firing,

03:57.250 --> 03:58.120
firing, firing.
Okay. Okay.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.990
Well, turn it off,
’cause we don’t

03:59.990 --> 04:00.990
have time for
that, okay?

04:00.990 --> 04:02.290
We’re running
out of money.

04:02.290 --> 04:03.290
We’re behind schedule.

04:03.290 --> 04:05.290
He will deliver.
He will get it done.

04:05.290 --> 04:06.870
Trust me. Can you trust me?

04:06.870 --> 04:08.580
Okay. This is on you.

04:08.580 --> 04:10.990
Okay. Thank you, partner.
This is on you.

04:10.990 --> 04:12.120
All right.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.620
All right,
Vito, listen.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.950
I got, uh... I got some cash.

04:15.950 --> 04:17.330
Okay, five grand
in here and a list

04:17.330 --> 04:19.750
of things that we need.
That’s for you.

04:19.750 --> 04:20.750
Feel free to bring us
some change.

04:20.750 --> 04:23.370
Yeah.
There’s a number in there,
a guy named Kamekona.

04:23.370 --> 04:25.330
If you should come
across any problems,

04:25.330 --> 04:26.790
you give him a call.

04:26.990 --> 04:28.580
Danny, close your eyes.
Okay.

04:28.580 --> 04:30.540
Open your eyes.
They’re open.

04:30.540 --> 04:31.370
It’s already done.

04:31.370 --> 04:33.540
You know, you don’t have
to actually do that.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.000
I’m not a magician.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
It’s gonna take me
a day or two.
Okay.

04:37.490 --> 04:39.040
McGarrett.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.450
DANNY:I know. You’ve been saying it.

04:41.450 --> 04:43.490
Yeah, and I’ll keep saying it
if I want to keep saying it.
You won’t stop saying it.

04:43.490 --> 04:45.500
All right?
Can we go on with our lives?
It’s boring now. Hi, Lou.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.870
Hey. How’d it go
with Uncle Vito?

04:46.870 --> 04:47.830
It went horrible.
It went great.

04:47.830 --> 04:49.290
It was fine.
It’s gonna work out great.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.490
Or not.
Maybe it won’t work out.

04:50.490 --> 04:51.200
But, anyway,
what do we got?

04:51.200 --> 04:53.580
We got a dead body
to take your minds off that.

04:53.580 --> 04:54.700
JUNIOR:
It was dredged out

04:54.700 --> 04:56.370
of Waimano Falls Lagoon
this morning

04:56.370 --> 04:57.910
after some cliff divers
discovered it.

04:57.910 --> 05:00.160
What’s with the marks
on his face?

05:00.160 --> 05:01.700
JUNIOR:
Our vic was wrapped

05:01.700 --> 05:02.370
in chicken wire.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.890
He was also weighted down
by a cinder block.

05:03.990 --> 05:05.410
Killer knew what he was doing.
Chicken wire--

05:05.410 --> 05:06.950
used chicken wire
so the fish can bite off

05:06.950 --> 05:08.750
little bits of the body and
nothing floats to the surface.

05:08.750 --> 05:11.290
It’s a good thing we found
the body, because Noelani said,

05:11.290 --> 05:12.990
if it was there
for a couple more weeks,

05:12.990 --> 05:14.370
there’d be nothing left
but bones.

05:14.370 --> 05:15.580
All right, what about
the C.O.D.?

05:15.580 --> 05:16.990
JUNIOR:
Blunt-force trauma.
He took a blow

05:16.990 --> 05:19.790
to the crown of the skull.
Based off the decomp,

05:19.790 --> 05:20.790
Noelani estimates that...

05:20.790 --> 05:23.080
he was dumped
within the last 48 hours.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.080
There is some good news, though.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.540
His skin was in
good enough condition

05:25.540 --> 05:27.200
that the crime lab
was able to pull prints.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.750
We got a hit with the Department
of Commerce and Safety.

05:29.750 --> 05:31.620
The vic’s name
is Leighton Prewitt,

05:31.620 --> 05:33.790
and he’s registered
as a private detective.

05:33.790 --> 05:36.080
Whatever he was
privately detecting

05:36.080 --> 05:37.450
is probably what got him killed.

05:37.450 --> 05:40.990
We need to look at this guy’s
open cases, then.

06:55.450 --> 06:57.990
You just punched the

06:57.990 --> 07:00.540
Yeah, and that was
the easy part.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.990
You jacked that car
without a single scratch.

07:06.990 --> 07:09.410
Who knew that under
that clean-cut look of yours

07:09.410 --> 07:11.910
you were a car-boosting
street racer?

07:11.910 --> 07:13.500
Been driving
since I was 14.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.250
Taught myself
on my father’s Ferrari.

07:15.250 --> 07:17.370
Course, he didn’t
know that.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.410
You boosted your father’s car?

07:19.410 --> 07:20.660
What a rebel.

07:20.660 --> 07:22.580
Yeah, I was--
until I wrapped that car

07:22.580 --> 07:23.750
around a lamppost
one night.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.870
Technically, I think
I’m still grounded.

Easy for you to say.

07:35.330 --> 07:40.330

Hey. Uncle Vito,
what’s going on?

07:48.990 --> 07:50.700
Hey, nephew.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.990
Lovely to hear from you-- again.

07:52.990 --> 07:53.830
Yeah, I

07:53.830 --> 07:55.580
I just want to see
what’s going on.

07:55.580 --> 07:56.370
Don’t worry about it.

07:56.370 --> 07:57.990
Don’t lose any hair over this.

07:57.990 --> 07:59.620
You know, I got it all
under control.

07:59.620 --> 08:01.950
In fact,
I’m a little busy right now.

08:01.950 --> 08:05.660
I gotta see a guy about
some copper plumbing, okay?

08:05.660 --> 08:08.160
Copper plum...

08:08.160 --> 08:10.040
Copper plumbing?

08:10.040 --> 08:12.410
So, Nicole, where were we?

08:12.410 --> 08:15.290
You were just about
to buy me another mojito.

08:15.290 --> 08:16.250
Right. Garçon.

08:16.250 --> 08:17.790
Another mojito
for my lady friend,

08:17.790 --> 08:19.990
and I’ll take another
one of these, uh,

08:19.990 --> 08:23.370
Mary Pickfords, but easy
on the grenadine, huh?

08:23.370 --> 08:24.990
You know, you remind me

08:24.990 --> 08:28.330
of, uh, the sort of class act
I used to go for

08:28.330 --> 08:29.040
back in the day.

08:29.040 --> 08:32.500
Frank---
he would’ve loved you.

08:32.500 --> 08:32.950
Frank?

08:32.950 --> 08:35.990
Sinatra. You know, he loved
beautiful girls like you.

08:35.990 --> 08:38.000
He was the greatest singer
of all time.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.660
You know what
he said to me once?

08:39.660 --> 08:42.990
He said, "Hey, kid, I think
you’re sitting on my coat."

08:42.990 --> 08:44.830
Frank Sinatra. What a voice.

08:44.830 --> 08:47.990
He said, "I think
you’re sitting on my coat."

08:47.990 --> 08:49.990
But enough about me.

08:50.410 --> 08:51.990
So, what’s, um...

08:51.990 --> 08:54.790
what’s your story,
beautiful?

08:55.790 --> 08:56.620
Well...

08:56.620 --> 08:59.040
I could tell you here, but...

08:59.040 --> 09:00.620
it’s so loud.

09:00.620 --> 09:04.040
Did you say you had
a room at the hotel?

09:07.990 --> 09:10.040
TANI:All right, we pulled the vic

09:10.040 --> 09:11.790
Leighton Prewitt’s open cases.

09:11.790 --> 09:12.910
We also ran
his phone records.

09:12.910 --> 09:15.700
He had 11 active cases.
Call logs show

09:15.700 --> 09:17.830
he spoke to five
of those clients

09:17.830 --> 09:18.660
in the 48 hours before he died.

09:18.660 --> 09:21.450
All right, then those are the
five clients we focus on first.

09:21.450 --> 09:23.080
Uh, something else you
may find interesting.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.990
Uh, Prewitt’s phone was
backing up to the cloud.

09:25.990 --> 09:26.580
The only photo which

09:26.580 --> 09:29.120
looks like it might
be case-related is this.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.120
We got any idea what

09:30.120 --> 09:32.990
the significance
of that bracelet is?
GROVER: Not so far.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.500
I mean, for all we
know, it could’ve been

09:34.500 --> 09:36.990
a present he was eyeing
for his girlfriend or something.

09:36.990 --> 09:38.990
Then why would he have it
in an evidence bag?

09:38.990 --> 09:41.790
My point is--
it ain’t much to go on.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.200
I agree with you. We need
to work with what we do have,

09:44.200 --> 09:45.990
which is our vic’s open cases,
all right?

09:45.990 --> 09:47.990
So let’s reach out
to the five clients

09:47.990 --> 09:49.580
that he spoke to most recently.

09:49.580 --> 09:51.000
Everybody take one,
interview them,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.500
report back and see
if somebody can shed some light

09:53.500 --> 09:56.790
on where Prewitt was
the day he died.

09:59.450 --> 10:02.950
WOMAN: Sorry. I, uh...
I just can’t believe he’s dead.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.370
I mean, I just spoke to him
a few days ago.

10:05.370 --> 10:08.950
Susan, can you tell me
why you hired Mr. Prewitt?

10:08.950 --> 10:13.700
About two years ago,
Micah, my husband--

10:13.700 --> 10:16.450
sorry, ex-husband--

10:16.450 --> 10:18.410
suddenly disappeared.

10:18.410 --> 10:18.990
Um...

10:18.990 --> 10:21.250
I’ve been trying to find
out what happened to him.

10:21.250 --> 10:25.910
Micah had been going
through a rough patch.

10:25.910 --> 10:27.830
First, he was laid
off from his job.

10:27.830 --> 10:29.200
Then he tried
starting a business,

10:29.200 --> 10:31.000
and that didn’t work out.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.580
He took it really hard.

10:32.580 --> 10:34.990
Saw his inability
to provide

10:34.990 --> 10:39.660
for the family
as a personal failure.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.950
It’s why our
marriage fell apart.

10:42.950 --> 10:43.990
I’m sorry.

10:43.990 --> 10:45.790
Everyone assumed
that Micah

10:45.790 --> 10:47.790
had just run away
from it all.

10:47.790 --> 10:48.290
But I knew him.

10:48.290 --> 10:51.950
There is no way that he would
abandon his kids like that.

10:51.950 --> 10:54.750
And I just can’t
shake the idea

10:54.750 --> 10:57.660
that something terrible
happened to him.

10:59.990 --> 11:02.660
This is the last
photo I have of him.

11:02.660 --> 11:04.750
It was our son’s birthday.

11:10.410 --> 11:11.990
Uh, Susan, uh...

11:11.990 --> 11:13.910
that bracelet there--
do you know

11:13.910 --> 11:14.990
where he got it from?

11:14.990 --> 11:18.040
Actually, I never
noticed that before.

11:18.330 --> 11:22.250
He must have started wearing
it after the divorce.

11:22.990 --> 11:25.990
Susan, you said you spoke
to Prewitt a few days ago.

11:25.990 --> 11:27.160
What did you guys talk about?

11:27.160 --> 11:30.660
He said he was following
a lead out in Waimea.

11:30.660 --> 11:33.290
Wanted me to okay an
overnight stay expense,

11:33.290 --> 11:35.330
which I did.

11:35.330 --> 11:37.000
That was it.

11:37.000 --> 11:37.500
Waimea?

11:37.500 --> 11:39.700
Wait a minute. That’s-that’s
right around the area

11:39.700 --> 11:40.990
where Prewitt’s body
was discovered.

11:40.990 --> 11:42.540
Yeah, less than a mile,
to be exact.

11:42.540 --> 11:45.040
All right, Junior, let’s say
you’re onto something here

11:45.040 --> 11:46.500
and Prewitt was
killed investigating

11:46.500 --> 11:47.990
the disappearance
of Micah Kalani.

11:47.990 --> 11:49.250
Tell me one thing

11:49.250 --> 11:51.910
Micah’s been missing
for almost two years.

11:51.910 --> 11:53.000
Yeah, see, that’s the thing.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.870
I just spoke
with Sergeant Lukela,

11:54.870 --> 11:57.660
and as far as HPD’s concerned,

11:57.660 --> 12:01.500
Kalani’s not considered
a missing person anymore.

12:02.040 --> 12:02.990
Why is that?

12:02.990 --> 12:05.750
MICAH :
Mom, Dad, it’s me.

12:05.750 --> 12:07.870
I just wanted you to know
that I miss you

12:07.870 --> 12:10.410
and I’m sorry for everything.

12:13.990 --> 12:14.990
Mr. and Mrs. Kalani,

12:14.990 --> 12:18.540
aside from this voice mail,
have you had any other contact

12:18.540 --> 12:20.290
with your son
since he disappeared?

12:20.290 --> 12:23.660
Actually, he’s called
the house several times.

12:23.660 --> 12:24.910
Has he?

12:24.910 --> 12:26.330
You’ve spoken to him?

12:26.330 --> 12:28.700
Well, it was missed
calls, really.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.290
A few times,
the phone rang,

12:30.290 --> 12:33.120
and no one was on
the other end.

12:33.290 --> 12:35.990
But it left you wondering--
could’ve been him.

12:35.990 --> 12:38.080
JUNIOR:
Sir, if I may, uh...

12:38.080 --> 12:39.990
According to Micah’s
ex-wife, Susan,

12:39.990 --> 12:42.660
his running off like this
never made any sense.

12:42.660 --> 12:45.990
She described it
as very out of character.

12:45.990 --> 12:47.250
Susan has her own agenda.

12:47.250 --> 12:49.120
What do you mean by that?

12:49.120 --> 12:51.580
Micah has a life
insurance policy.

12:51.580 --> 12:54.250
That’s why Susan hired
that investigator.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.990
She’s been trying
to have Micah declared dead

12:56.990 --> 12:59.040
so that she can cash in.

13:01.620 --> 13:02.450
Mr. and Mrs. Kalani,

13:02.450 --> 13:04.450
I have to ask--
assuming Micah is alive,

13:04.450 --> 13:06.750
can you think of any reason
why he would not

13:06.750 --> 13:08.830
want to go home to his family?

13:09.990 --> 13:13.830
A few times
before Micah disappeared,

13:13.830 --> 13:16.750
he came by the house...

13:16.750 --> 13:18.450
asking for money.

13:18.450 --> 13:20.080
He say what it was for?
No.

13:20.080 --> 13:23.370
But it was a lot of money.

13:23.700 --> 13:24.950
Whatever he
needed it for,

13:24.950 --> 13:29.580
it just seemed like
he was in trouble.

13:31.870 --> 13:34.000
♪ ♪

14:02.200 --> 14:03.410
Had a key made.

14:03.410 --> 14:06.790
In case you don’t
have the original with you.

14:11.830 --> 14:13.330
So many questions.

14:13.330 --> 14:16.990
Why don’t you start
by telling me who you are.

14:16.990 --> 14:17.910
Jessie Nomura.

14:17.910 --> 14:21.080
And how did you get
your hands on my car?

14:21.080 --> 14:21.990
I stole it.

14:21.990 --> 14:23.910
Have a guy in
Shanghai who pays

14:23.910 --> 14:25.990
top dollar
for German luxury cars.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.160
But then I realized
whose it was

14:27.160 --> 14:30.870
and decided it was in
my best interest to return it.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.540
With my apologies.

14:32.540 --> 14:35.990
A thief with honor.

14:37.080 --> 14:40.330
Not something
you see every day.

14:42.290 --> 14:46.750
This is about more than
just honor, isn’t it?

14:46.750 --> 14:47.660
Mr. Hideki...

14:47.660 --> 14:52.500
I want nothing except for
your forgiveness for my actions.

14:53.250 --> 14:54.990
I’m torn.

14:54.990 --> 14:57.620
You stole from me.

14:57.620 --> 15:00.660
So I should probably kill you.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.250
Then again...

15:04.250 --> 15:07.700
could’ve taken the easy way out
and just dumped the car.

15:07.700 --> 15:08.870
It took...

15:08.870 --> 15:09.990
You can say "balls."

15:09.990 --> 15:14.080
It took courage to come here

15:14.080 --> 15:15.950
knowing there was a chance

15:15.950 --> 15:19.540
I wouldn’t be in
a forgiving mood.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.580
Good-bye, Miss Nomura.

15:31.910 --> 15:35.040
TANI:So we just pulled
Micah Kalani’s financials.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.000
His dad was right.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.080
In the months
before he disappeared,

15:38.080 --> 15:39.790
he maxed out
his credit cards

15:39.790 --> 15:40.990
and he drained
his bank account.

15:40.990 --> 15:42.910
So, what are we thinking?
Uh, gambling, drugs?

15:42.910 --> 15:44.620
GROVER: Sure. Then,
when you run out

15:44.620 --> 15:45.870
of legitimate ways to get

15:45.870 --> 15:48.000
some more money,
what’s the next stop?

15:48.000 --> 15:48.870
Loan sharks and bookies.

15:48.870 --> 15:50.410
Type of people
who don’t respond well

15:50.410 --> 15:52.120
when you don’t meet
your repayment plan.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.830
Yeah, that would explain
why he disappeared

15:53.830 --> 15:55.000
rather than declaring
bankruptcy.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.620
Right, and he probably was not
too keen on a P.I. out there

15:58.620 --> 16:00.160
looking to confirm
his whereabouts.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.870
Looks like Micah Kalani’s
still alive.

16:01.870 --> 16:05.040
And it looks to me like
he might be our killer.

16:07.330 --> 16:08.490
HIDEKI:Things are changing, Ikko.

16:08.490 --> 16:11.120
:
These days, I’m like a CEO

16:11.120 --> 16:12.370
reporting to my board.

16:12.370 --> 16:15.500
Tokyo expects a 200% increase
across the business.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.500
IKKO:
You said it yourself:

16:16.500 --> 16:19.540
The weakness of our competitors
is our opportunity.

16:19.540 --> 16:20.750
HIDEKI:
That’s right.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.490
After you drop me at Taka’s,

16:22.490 --> 16:24.750
I want you to pick up
the dead drops.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.490
We got a collection tomorrow.

16:26.490 --> 16:28.620
Sounds like they’re
sending money

16:28.620 --> 16:29.750
back to Tokyo
tomorrow.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.950
If you can get Hideki in
a room with that cash,

16:31.950 --> 16:33.790
that’s enough to make a
bust, especially with

16:33.790 --> 16:35.490
what we have on the wire.
You’re forgetting,

16:35.490 --> 16:37.330
Hideki’s not the one
we’re after here.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.870
Right. I know.
We want the bogeyman--

16:38.870 --> 16:41.500
this mystery player you’re
convinced is running the show.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.660
But if you can put
pressure on Hideki,

16:43.660 --> 16:44.910
maybe he’ll give
that person up.

16:44.910 --> 16:46.620
Or he’ll lawyer up
and not say a word,

16:46.620 --> 16:49.490
and all we’ll have done
is shown our hand.

16:49.790 --> 16:52.200
Looks like he’s headed
to Taka’s barber shop.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.950
STEVE:Okay, here’s what we know.

16:53.950 --> 16:56.490
This is where Prewitt’s body
was found--

16:56.490 --> 16:57.790
right here at Waimano Falls.

16:57.790 --> 16:59.870
Now, Susan Barnes
told us that Prewitt

16:59.870 --> 17:01.330
was out here
looking for leads

17:01.330 --> 17:02.660
into the disappearance
of Micah Kalani.

17:02.660 --> 17:05.450
Okay, so if Micah’s
still alive and laying low,

17:05.450 --> 17:06.490
he could be hiding somewhere

17:06.490 --> 17:07.790
within the vicinity.
Exactly.

17:07.790 --> 17:10.000
I want you to get units out
there to comb the entire area.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.080
Get helos up in the air
looking for a dwelling,

17:12.080 --> 17:15.620
whether it’s a hut, a
tent

17:15.620 --> 17:16.910
Yes, sir.

17:16.910 --> 17:17.660
Hold up, hold up.

17:17.660 --> 17:19.620
I think we gotta revise
our theory

17:19.620 --> 17:20.830
that Micah’s still alive.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.450
What are you talking about?

17:22.450 --> 17:23.700
MICAH :
Mom, Dad, it’s me.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.040
I just wanted you to know
that I miss you

17:26.040 --> 17:28.120
and I’m sorry for everything.

17:28.120 --> 17:30.450
Hear that background swash?

17:30.450 --> 17:31.160
Those are waves.

17:31.160 --> 17:33.160
The weird thing,
though, is that

17:33.160 --> 17:34.540
the pay phone
where the call was made,

17:34.540 --> 17:37.410
it wasn’t anywhere
near the ocean.

17:38.580 --> 17:40.750
Micah didn’t make
that call, did he?

17:40.750 --> 17:42.160
Mr. Kalani,

17:42.160 --> 17:44.410
that was you holding
your cell phone up

17:44.410 --> 17:45.490
to a pay phone receiver,

17:45.490 --> 17:46.950
playing back
an old voice mail.

17:46.950 --> 17:49.450
Isn’t that right?

17:50.950 --> 17:53.490
Until we had proof otherwise,
I thought it was better

17:53.490 --> 17:57.490
that my wife believe that
Micah was still alive.

17:57.490 --> 17:58.620
It was wrong.

17:58.620 --> 18:03.540
But I can’t get the last time
I saw Micah out of my head.

18:03.540 --> 18:08.040
He came to me
asking for money.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.490
I said no.

18:09.490 --> 18:13.620
Told him not to come
around the house anymore.

18:14.450 --> 18:17.000
I thought tough love
was the best medicine,

18:17.000 --> 18:21.410
but now I’m worried that he
might have hurt himself.

18:21.410 --> 18:22.200
Why would you think that?

18:22.200 --> 18:24.410
KYLE: He was manic.
He was shouting at me,

18:24.410 --> 18:25.410
telling me I didn’t understand

18:25.410 --> 18:28.370
the importance
of what he was doing.

18:28.950 --> 18:31.450
He scared me. I...

18:31.450 --> 18:34.660
I didn’t recognize my own son.

18:49.660 --> 18:53.490
Just a half inch or
so off the ends.

18:54.250 --> 18:55.120
Mr. Hideki.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.450
What are the odds?

19:13.790 --> 19:16.370
Personally...

19:16.370 --> 19:19.290
I don’t believe
in coincidences.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.540
:
I also don’t know many women

19:21.540 --> 19:24.160
who want their hair cut
in a barber shop.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.410
JESSIE: To be clear,
I just wanted a trim.

19:27.410 --> 19:31.750
Can we stop
playing this game?

19:31.750 --> 19:35.290
I know you stole my car
to get my attention.

19:35.290 --> 19:37.790
Now here you are again.

19:37.790 --> 19:39.080
So...

19:41.250 --> 19:43.160
What is it you want?

19:45.490 --> 19:46.660
I have certain aptitudes

19:46.660 --> 19:49.910
that are not really suited
to civilian life.

19:49.910 --> 19:52.080
But things have changed
since I went away.

19:52.080 --> 19:54.540
There used to be ten or
12 potential employers

19:54.540 --> 19:58.580
for someone like me, and now
it seems there’s only one.

19:58.580 --> 20:00.500
You.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.490
But to be clear,
I’m not expecting

20:02.490 --> 20:03.870
a pension plan or health care.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.490
Just a chance to impress.

20:06.750 --> 20:08.790
If it’s a question
of needing references,

20:08.790 --> 20:11.080
I’d be happy to get you some.

20:11.080 --> 20:11.750
No.

20:11.750 --> 20:14.700
I’ve done my homework on you.

20:14.910 --> 20:18.290
It’s possible I could use
someone with your skill set.

20:18.290 --> 20:20.490
JESSIE:
You won’t regret it.

20:20.490 --> 20:23.000
We’ll see, won’t we?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.620
Ikko.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.910
Go take care of that business
we discussed.

20:27.910 --> 20:30.500
Miss Nomura and I
are gonna get to know

20:30.500 --> 20:34.580
each other a little better.

20:48.160 --> 20:51.000
♪ ♪

21:13.450 --> 21:15.500
Oh, thank God.

21:15.500 --> 21:16.000
Hey.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.290
It’s not what it looks like.
I was robbed.

21:19.620 --> 21:21.540
I got robbed, all right?

21:22.910 --> 21:24.790
Hey. I hear we got something.
DANNY: Yeah.

21:24.790 --> 21:27.490
HPD’s canvas of the jungle
turned up Prewitt’s car.

21:27.490 --> 21:29.080
GROVER:
Car was abandoned

21:29.080 --> 21:30.160
less than two miles away

21:30.160 --> 21:31.790
from where Prewitt’s body
was dumped.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.790
Now, CSU’s still
processing the scene,

21:33.790 --> 21:36.490
but they’ve already found
something really interesting.

21:36.490 --> 21:38.160
They found a parking receipt

21:38.160 --> 21:41.080
that was dated the day
before Prewitt was murdered.

21:41.080 --> 21:44.330
Now, this receipt came
from a visit Prewitt made

21:44.330 --> 21:46.790
to a mental health facility
in Wailua.

21:46.790 --> 21:49.160
JUNIOR: I just spoke to
the receptionist there,

21:49.160 --> 21:51.410
and according to their log book,
Prewitt was there

21:51.410 --> 21:54.000
to visit a patient
named Gregory Isaacs.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.660
Is this Isaacs connected

21:55.660 --> 21:57.410
to Micah Kalani’s disappearance?

21:57.410 --> 21:58.200
Safe to assume, yes.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.160
A few days after Micah
went missing,

22:00.160 --> 22:02.370
Isaacs was found stumbling
out of the jungle.

22:02.370 --> 22:04.490
The same jungle where Prewitt’s
body and car were found.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.620
GROVER:
And apparently, the guy
was in a state of shock.

22:07.620 --> 22:09.490
He was a complete mess--

22:09.490 --> 22:11.490
catatonic,
unable to communicate,

22:11.490 --> 22:13.040
thousand-yard stare,
the whole nine.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.200
They admitted him
to the psych ward,

22:15.200 --> 22:17.500
where doctors determined
that this guy

22:17.500 --> 22:19.370
had had a complete mental break.

22:19.370 --> 22:21.660
The kind that
would be induced

22:21.660 --> 22:23.410
by a traumatic event.

22:23.410 --> 22:26.080
They also think that there
were drugs involved.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.540
And look at that.

22:27.540 --> 22:28.410
Look at his wrist.

22:28.410 --> 22:32.540
The bracelet. It’s the same
bracelet Micah Kalani has.

22:32.540 --> 22:33.950
That bracelet connects

22:33.950 --> 22:36.580
Micah Kalani
and Gregory Isaacs. Right?

22:36.580 --> 22:37.410
They both went into

22:37.410 --> 22:39.450
the same jungle,
but as far as we know,

22:39.450 --> 22:40.080
only Isaacs returned.

22:40.080 --> 22:42.080
Yeah, and whatever he saw
in the jungle

22:42.080 --> 22:42.830
bugged him out pretty good.

22:42.830 --> 22:46.410
We need to find out
what happened in that jungle.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.420
STEVE: Mr. Isaacs,
do you remember

22:54.420 --> 22:56.130
getting a visit from this man?

22:56.130 --> 22:59.840
His name’s Leighton Prewitt.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.460
Uh, Steve, I don’t
think he’s, um...

23:04.460 --> 23:05.960
in the... in
the building.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.290
Or on Earth, for that matter.

23:07.290 --> 23:08.340
You know what I mean?
What about this man?

23:08.340 --> 23:12.000
This is Micah Kalani.
You ever seen him before?

23:13.290 --> 23:16.290
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

23:16.290 --> 23:17.880
No! No!

23:17.880 --> 23:20.420
Settle down.
No! No!

23:20.420 --> 23:22.460
No!

23:22.460 --> 23:24.500
No!

23:26.360 --> 23:27.690
VITO :
Yo, this is Vito.

23:27.690 --> 23:29.150
I ain’t here. Leave a message.
Hey, uh...

23:29.150 --> 23:31.280
Vito, um, I’m just checking
to see what’s going on.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.690
I haven’t heard from you.
I’m just making sure

23:33.690 --> 23:34.570
you’re getting stuff done.

23:34.570 --> 23:37.360
Uh, call me when you can,
all right?

23:37.990 --> 23:39.740
STEVE:Greg, listen to me.

23:39.740 --> 23:43.450
You know what happened to
Micah Kalani, don’t you?

23:43.740 --> 23:45.990
The bridge...
DANNY: What’d he say?

23:45.990 --> 23:48.780
He said "the bridge."
What bridge, Greg

23:48.780 --> 23:50.740
We never should have gone there.

23:50.740 --> 23:51.860
Where’d you go?

23:51.860 --> 23:53.450
Greg, where’d you go?

23:53.450 --> 23:54.570
Tell me where you went.
Where’d you go?

23:54.570 --> 23:56.610
NURSE Please. He’s been
through enough today.

23:56.610 --> 23:58.950
He needs some rest.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.900
All right.

24:11.650 --> 24:12.860
Hey. Hey.

24:12.860 --> 24:15.950
Can I help you, sir?
Sure as hell hope so.

24:15.950 --> 24:17.110
I’m Vito from Jersey.

24:17.110 --> 24:19.690
I believe my nephew,
he told you about me.

24:19.690 --> 24:22.110
Yeah, he mentioned
you might be calling.

24:22.110 --> 24:23.900
I didn’t expect a
personal visit.

24:23.900 --> 24:26.450
Yeah, well, this matter
I need to discuss with you,

24:26.450 --> 24:31.950
uh, let’s just say it’s, um...
it’s of a sensitive nature.

24:32.690 --> 24:34.030
And she just
left me there,

24:34.030 --> 24:35.690
naked as the day
I was born.

24:35.690 --> 24:38.690
Strung out like a salami
in a butcher shop window.

24:38.690 --> 24:41.950
I had to beg her just to
cover me up with a towel.

24:41.950 --> 24:44.400
A hand towel?
No, a bath towel.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.360
But she didn’t just
rob me of my dignity.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.280
She took my Roley
and the five Gs

24:49.280 --> 24:51.740
Danny gave me
for the restaurant supplies.

24:51.740 --> 24:55.320
I’m all messed up here.
You gotta help me out.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.150
Tell me this.

24:57.150 --> 24:59.690
The Rolex, is it real?

24:59.690 --> 25:00.860
Is it real?

25:00.860 --> 25:03.740
What do you think, "is it real?"

25:05.650 --> 25:08.990
Okay, it fell off a truck
in the Philippines, okay?

25:08.990 --> 25:10.860
So it’s fake?
Yeah.

25:10.860 --> 25:15.990
That might be the one
thing that saves your ass.

25:21.860 --> 25:24.360
Hey, not so fast, honey-bunch.

25:24.360 --> 25:27.200
How’d you find me?
KAMEKONA: All it took
was a few calls

25:27.200 --> 25:29.690
to some pawnshops,
asking about a woman

25:29.690 --> 25:31.690
trying to hock a fake Roley.

25:31.690 --> 25:33.690
You have any idea
how sore

25:33.690 --> 25:35.530
my feet and my ankles are?

25:35.530 --> 25:36.400
They swelled up

25:36.400 --> 25:38.740
like a couple of
grapefruits, thanks to you.

25:38.740 --> 25:40.780
KAMEKONA: Yeah, that’s
borderline psychopathic,

25:40.780 --> 25:43.740
taking advantage
of an old man like that.

25:43.740 --> 25:47.450
Hey, less on the "old
man" stuff, will you?

25:47.450 --> 25:47.900
Sorry.

25:47.900 --> 25:49.450
Look, I don’t want
any problems.

25:49.450 --> 25:51.900
Just tell me you
still got my money.

25:55.690 --> 25:57.070
Oh, come on.

25:57.070 --> 26:01.030
If it makes you feel any
better, I still got $27 change.

26:01.610 --> 26:03.860
And your watch.

26:05.900 --> 26:08.610
All right, get all these bags
and your receipts.

26:08.610 --> 26:09.990
We’re bringing
everything back.

26:09.990 --> 26:11.280
Come on. Chop-chop.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.860
Don’t forget the
statue of Adonis.

26:18.950 --> 26:20.700
You dropped eight bills on this?

26:20.700 --> 26:22.360
Come on, sugar.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.820
Come on, let’s go
get my money back.

26:24.820 --> 26:25.690
Hold on.

26:25.690 --> 26:29.690
Oh, you don’t want
to take that call.

26:30.650 --> 26:32.200
Straight to voice mail again.
Uh-huh.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.030
Don’t "uh
I know what he’s doing.

26:34.030 --> 26:35.150
Vito is doing the stuff
we asked him to do.

26:35.150 --> 26:36.740
That’s why he’s not
answering the phone.
Okay. No, no, listen.

26:36.740 --> 26:39.690
He’s working.
You said Vito is just the guy
to come and solve our problem,

26:39.690 --> 26:40.990
and I trust you a thousand
percent, Danny, so...

26:40.990 --> 26:43.530
No, no, don’t do that.
Don’t try to get under my skin.

26:43.530 --> 26:44.400
My skin is
un

26:44.400 --> 26:46.530
Guys, tell me you got something.
What do you got?

26:46.530 --> 26:47.780
I got something.
I got a massive headache

26:47.780 --> 26:50.690
from banging my head against
the wall over this thing.

26:50.690 --> 26:52.740
Other than that, no, nothing.

26:52.740 --> 26:54.200
We’ve been going over maps

26:54.200 --> 26:56.820
and sat images of where
Isaacs was discovered.

26:56.820 --> 26:59.200
If there is anything we can say
with absolute certainty,

26:59.200 --> 27:01.240
it’s that there is no bridge
to be found.

27:01.240 --> 27:03.280
There’s gotta be something.
All right?

27:03.280 --> 27:05.450
These guys, they wore
identical bracelets,

27:05.450 --> 27:09.320
they go into the exact same
part of an enormous jungle.

27:09.320 --> 27:10.740
They’re connected.

27:10.740 --> 27:12.740
We need to find out how.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.320
So, this drink...

27:17.320 --> 27:19.320
it means I have
a job with you?

27:19.320 --> 27:21.320
We’ll get to that.

27:21.320 --> 27:23.110
For now, let’s talk.

27:23.110 --> 27:24.280
What about?

27:24.280 --> 27:26.150
I need to be able to trust

27:26.150 --> 27:28.110
the people in my crew.

27:28.110 --> 27:30.690
And trust is earned over time.

27:31.690 --> 27:33.530
I just did a six-year stretch.

27:33.530 --> 27:35.900
Could’ve been six months
if I’d given up my crew.

27:35.900 --> 27:39.400
But the next time you go away,
it’ll be for life.

27:39.690 --> 27:41.610
Time like that...

27:41.610 --> 27:43.990
would get anyone talking.

27:43.990 --> 27:46.690
I know how
to keep my mouth shut.

28:12.690 --> 28:15.820
I need you to take a look
at the boss’s car.

28:15.820 --> 28:17.150
Open every panel.

28:17.150 --> 28:19.820
I want it swept
for bugs and GPS.

have to do with our case?

29:23.240 --> 29:24.490
TANI:
This is Visha Kundahara.

29:24.490 --> 29:26.490
He’s the author of the bookCrossing the Bridge.

29:26.490 --> 29:28.990
It’s a self-published book
that turned up

29:28.990 --> 29:31.530
on an old photo on one
of Isaacs’ Facebook pages.

29:31.530 --> 29:34.110
DANNY:
So, you think the
bridge that Isaacs

29:34.110 --> 29:35.490
was babbling about is his book?

29:35.490 --> 29:37.400
It seems like a
bit of a stretch.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.530
It seems like more
than a bit of a stretch.

29:38.530 --> 29:42.320
Until you consider that-thatThe Bridgeisn’t just a book.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.070
It’s the central text

29:43.070 --> 29:46.990
to an entire self-help religion
that Kundahara created.

29:46.990 --> 29:48.690
The thing is basically a cult.

29:48.690 --> 29:50.360
Right,
he charges people

29:50.360 --> 29:52.610
thousands upon
thousands of dollars

29:52.610 --> 29:53.900
to take these courses,

29:53.900 --> 29:57.530
including Greg Isaacs.
STEVE: Wait a minute.

29:57.530 --> 29:59.320
Do we know if Micah Kalani
did the course?

29:59.320 --> 30:01.450
Well, I looked
into his financials.

30:01.450 --> 30:02.570
So, a bunch of withdrawals

30:02.570 --> 30:05.240
matched the exact amount
that Kundahara charges

30:05.240 --> 30:08.530
for these courses--
like, to the dollar.

30:08.690 --> 30:09.990
But here’s the
smoking gun.

30:09.990 --> 30:11.690
Each level that
you complete,

30:11.690 --> 30:14.690
you receive a
stringed bracelet.

30:14.780 --> 30:15.990
It’s like martial arts grades.

30:15.990 --> 30:19.150
There’s a different color
for each level.

30:19.650 --> 30:21.780
Oh, that’s not creepy at all.

30:21.780 --> 30:24.950
The whole course builds up
to the final level.

30:24.950 --> 30:26.690
It’s called "The Crossing."

30:26.690 --> 30:30.110
Kundahara himself
performs this ceremony

30:30.110 --> 30:32.690
where he reveals
the "ultimate wisdom"

30:32.690 --> 30:33.950
to all his disciples.

30:33.950 --> 30:35.690
And, based on
the purple bracelets

30:35.690 --> 30:37.110
that both these guys
were wearing,

30:37.110 --> 30:38.950
it means that they both
graduated to that level.

30:38.950 --> 30:41.400
So, these two guys go
traipsing into the jungle

30:41.400 --> 30:43.450
to meet the good
reverend guru.

30:43.450 --> 30:44.820
Only one of them
comes out alive,

30:44.820 --> 30:46.400
and that guy’s lost
his damn mind.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.650
He can’t even tell
us what his name is,

30:48.650 --> 30:50.070
much less what
happened in there.

30:50.070 --> 30:51.570
Ah, but Prewitt...
Prewitt probably

30:51.570 --> 30:52.320
had that much figured out.

30:52.320 --> 30:54.070
STEVE:
Right. He must have
been getting close

30:54.070 --> 30:55.650
to finding out
what happened to Micah.

30:55.650 --> 30:57.110
And that’s why
he was killed.

30:57.110 --> 30:59.990
Okay. Well, how do you get a
meeting with, uh, this guru guy?

30:59.990 --> 31:01.650
’Cause I think that seems
like the next...

31:01.650 --> 31:03.690
TANI: Yeah, well, it’s
easier said than done.

31:03.690 --> 31:04.690
This guy’s gone to ground.

31:04.690 --> 31:07.690
Actually, around the time
of Micah’s disappearance,

31:07.690 --> 31:09.110
the whole business
was shuttered.

31:09.110 --> 31:11.200
The Web site was taken down,
and somebody did

31:11.200 --> 31:14.690
a pretty good job
at scrubbing all references

31:14.690 --> 31:16.700
to Visha Kundahara online.

31:16.700 --> 31:17.450
Visha Kundahara.

31:17.450 --> 31:20.650
I-I’m guessing thishaole
wasn’t born with that name.

31:20.650 --> 31:21.740
Yeah, I’m with Junior.

31:21.740 --> 31:24.490
Let’s check
public records, Tani.

31:24.690 --> 31:26.240
All right, here we go.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.610
Looks like he did
change his name

31:28.610 --> 31:30.650
nine years ago by deed poll.

31:30.650 --> 31:32.240
His real name is Devin Walsh.

31:32.240 --> 31:35.240
And according to this,
he bought a plot of land

31:35.240 --> 31:37.990
in March 2010, and...

31:37.990 --> 31:39.490
it’s in the middle
of the Kalihi jungle.

31:39.490 --> 31:41.690
Hey, that’s near where
Prewitt’s body was found.

31:41.690 --> 31:44.690
That’s right.
Then that’s where we go.

32:06.820 --> 32:07.990
Is that a wire?

32:07.990 --> 32:11.030
Yeah. You got cops
listening to you.

32:14.970 --> 32:18.300
Why do I get the feeling
that as long as I keep drinking,

32:18.300 --> 32:19.600
you’re going to
keep pouring?

32:19.600 --> 32:23.510
Saké wa honshin
wo arawasu.

32:24.850 --> 32:27.640
It’s an old Japanese proverb.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.470
"Sake reveals the true heart."

32:29.470 --> 32:32.090
You speak Japanese.

32:33.430 --> 32:35.510
What else do I need
to know about you?

32:35.510 --> 32:38.100
Hello.

32:38.100 --> 32:39.970
Put him on.

32:39.970 --> 32:41.850
Now.

32:50.090 --> 32:51.800
The phone.

32:57.140 --> 32:59.090
HIDEKI:
Yes.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.930
Ikko, are you there?

33:02.510 --> 33:04.100
On your knees.

33:04.100 --> 33:05.600
Now.

33:14.680 --> 33:16.100
All right, guys, look sharp.

33:16.100 --> 33:18.090
Up ahead, about 50 yards.

33:18.090 --> 33:19.850
Thank God. Pretty soon,
there’s not gonna be

33:19.850 --> 33:21.640
anything left of me
for the bugs to feed on.

33:21.640 --> 33:26.090
Hey, Junes, tell me, how do you
manage not to get bitten?

33:26.090 --> 33:26.890
I don’t know.

33:26.890 --> 33:28.850
Maybe you’re a lot
tastier than me.

33:28.850 --> 33:31.430
Well, that goes
without saying.

33:54.010 --> 33:54.850
Five-O!

33:54.850 --> 33:55.970
Hands right now.

33:55.970 --> 33:58.800
Hands where we
can see ’em.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.090
Nobody move.

34:01.220 --> 34:04.090
Where’s Devin Walsh?

34:08.970 --> 34:10.470
Drop your weapons!

34:11.140 --> 34:14.720
Put ’em down.
Put ’em down right now.

34:20.970 --> 34:21.680
What is this?

34:21.680 --> 34:24.470
Devin Walsh, Five-O.
We’re here to bring you in.

34:24.470 --> 34:28.090
Tell your people to put
their weapons down.

34:29.850 --> 34:33.760
You already have the blood
of two men on your hands.

34:33.760 --> 34:36.140
If these people do not
lower their weapons,

34:36.140 --> 34:38.090
they are gonna get hurt.

34:41.180 --> 34:45.090
My students will do
what they feel is right.

34:45.090 --> 34:47.680
It’s out of my hands.

34:54.640 --> 34:55.390
Put ’em down.

34:55.390 --> 34:56.350
Put your guns down right now!

34:56.350 --> 35:00.550
Down. I’m telling you,
man, put ’em down.

35:06.890 --> 35:10.430
GROVER:
Now, get your hands
behind your head.

35:10.430 --> 35:12.300
Step away from your weapons.

35:13.090 --> 35:16.090
You-- hands behind
your head.

35:16.090 --> 35:18.930
Interlock your
fingers right now.

35:24.350 --> 35:26.390
Move. Move.

35:30.050 --> 35:32.640
STEVE:HPD just finished
searching the compound.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.800
GROVER:And they found this.

35:35.550 --> 35:38.090
Hawaiian baby woodrose plant.

35:38.090 --> 35:40.090
Got enough of this stuff
lying around

35:40.090 --> 35:41.300
to start your own flower shop.

35:41.300 --> 35:43.470
But that’s not what
you had in mind, huh, is it?

35:43.470 --> 35:47.090
Lou, the plant itself is...
is actually perfectly legal.

35:47.090 --> 35:48.090
Oh, yeah.
However...

35:48.090 --> 35:50.930
the chemical, LSA, that
you’ve been extracting

35:50.930 --> 35:53.010
from the seeds...
not so much.

35:53.010 --> 35:54.890
That’s a Schedule II
controlled substance.

35:54.890 --> 35:56.890
GROVER: Serious business.
This is right up there

35:56.890 --> 35:57.470
with peyote and, uh...

35:57.470 --> 35:59.470
What’s the other one
you told me?

35:59.470 --> 36:01.720
Ayahuasca.
Ayahuasca. Yeah.

36:01.720 --> 36:02.970
Which got us to thinking.

36:02.970 --> 36:07.090
Now, what would a legitimate
spiritual guru like yourself

36:07.090 --> 36:12.090
be needing with a bunch
of powerful psychoactive drugs?

36:12.090 --> 36:13.430
Then it hit us.

36:13.430 --> 36:16.390
The "Crossing the Bridge"
ceremony, right?

36:16.390 --> 36:18.850
You take these
gullible young students

36:18.850 --> 36:20.180
out in the middle
of the jungle,

36:20.180 --> 36:21.510
get ’em baked
out of their minds.

36:21.510 --> 36:25.720
You had these young skulls
full of mush tripping so hard

36:25.720 --> 36:28.640
they thought they were actually
achieving enlightenment.

36:28.640 --> 36:29.890
And Micah Kalani...

36:29.890 --> 36:33.010
he was a perfect victim
for you, wasn’t he?

36:33.010 --> 36:33.930
’Cause the guy
was desperate.

36:33.930 --> 36:36.100
He was desperate to get
his business back on track

36:36.100 --> 36:39.220
and start providing
for his family, who he loved.

36:39.220 --> 36:40.140
And then you show up.

36:40.140 --> 36:43.090
You convince him that
you can help unleash

36:43.090 --> 36:44.680
all this untapped
potential he’s got.

36:44.680 --> 36:45.930
So, what does he do?
He gives you

36:45.930 --> 36:48.140
thousands of dollars,
he gives you months of his life,

36:48.140 --> 36:50.050
only to find out
that that awakening,

36:50.050 --> 36:52.090
that ultimate revelation
that you promised him

36:52.090 --> 36:54.930
and that he was hoping
for, it doesn’t exist.

36:54.930 --> 36:58.090
It doesn’t exist
because it’s all a scam.

36:58.090 --> 37:00.510
Well, hey, you said it yourself.

37:00.510 --> 37:04.510
Possession of the woodrose plant
is perfectly legal.

37:04.510 --> 37:06.220
That’s true.
You did say that.

37:06.220 --> 37:07.970
I did say that.
As for me...

37:07.970 --> 37:11.600
I was just protecting
my property from trespassers.

37:11.600 --> 37:15.930
Don’t recall hearing you
mention a warrant.

37:16.090 --> 37:17.430
Everything else
sounds like

37:17.430 --> 37:19.090
conjecture to me.

37:19.090 --> 37:21.760
Maybe a lawyer
can clear that up.

37:21.760 --> 37:23.090
Let me just help

37:23.090 --> 37:25.350
enlighten you on something.

37:25.350 --> 37:26.760
Your people--

37:26.760 --> 37:30.090
not quite as loyal
as you think they are.

37:30.970 --> 37:32.680
See this?

37:32.930 --> 37:35.260
We got three
independent confessions

37:35.260 --> 37:38.050
saying exactly
the same thing.

37:38.050 --> 37:39.890
You killed Prewitt,

37:39.890 --> 37:41.720
and you directed them
to dump his body.

37:41.720 --> 37:45.800
Turns out it was very close to
where you dumped Micah’s body.

37:45.800 --> 37:48.350
Good thinking. We got
divers going over

37:48.350 --> 37:49.470
the place right now.

37:49.470 --> 37:51.390
So, what happened?

37:51.390 --> 37:52.090
Huh?

37:52.090 --> 37:53.970
Micah figured out
this whole thing was a scam,

37:53.970 --> 37:56.510
and then did he wig out
a little bit, he get violent?

37:56.510 --> 37:58.470
I’m thinking he threatened
to expose you

37:58.470 --> 38:02.090
and this giant con game
you got going on.

38:02.090 --> 38:03.430
You really thought you were
gonna get away with it?

38:03.430 --> 38:05.350
Why wouldn’t he think
he’d gotten away with it?

38:05.350 --> 38:07.510
Two years has gone by.
The case is cold.

38:07.510 --> 38:09.090
HPD’s washed
their hands of it.

38:09.090 --> 38:10.350
They’re not
investigating anymore.

38:10.350 --> 38:12.220
But then...
then Prewitt shows up.

38:12.220 --> 38:13.640
With his nosy ass.
Right? This P.I.

38:13.640 --> 38:16.090
He knows everything.
He’s got it all figured out.

38:16.090 --> 38:17.090
What are you gonna do?

38:17.090 --> 38:20.390
You take him out,
get rid of the body.

38:20.390 --> 38:21.550
GROVER:
Well, after all,

38:21.550 --> 38:23.890
what’s one more murder
to this guy?

38:23.890 --> 38:24.760
Here’s the good news, buddy.

38:24.760 --> 38:27.510
You got the rest of your life
to meditate on that question

38:27.510 --> 38:30.050
inside the solitude
of a six-by-eight cell.

38:30.050 --> 38:31.010
Oh, it’s getting late.

38:31.010 --> 38:35.140
