00:01.088 --> 00:02.437
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...

00:02.480 --> 00:04.091
If you keep putting in
this practice,

00:04.134 --> 00:05.396
<i>you're gonna blow</i> <i>
the other recruits away.</i>

00:05.440 --> 00:06.789
Deac says you got
what it takes

00:06.832 --> 00:08.225
- to do real SWAT work.
- You're the one who

00:08.269 --> 00:11.228
gave me the chance, so...
It means a lot to me.

00:11.272 --> 00:12.490
The baby was born,

00:12.534 --> 00:15.015
but Crystal changed her mind.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.625
We're gonna figure
this out together.

00:16.668 --> 00:18.931
I withdrew my name
from consideration

00:18.975 --> 00:20.629
with the
adoption agency.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.457
Hey, let's have a kid together.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.328
I want
the same thing.

00:24.372 --> 00:25.721
I still feel the same way
I did when you left.

00:25.764 --> 00:27.288
I want to give this
a real shot.

00:27.331 --> 00:28.985
You know we can't
be together right now.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.682
I would never ask you
to compromise yourself

00:30.726 --> 00:33.250
<i>at work, but I can't keep doing</i>

00:33.294 --> 00:34.643
<i>whatever this is.</i>

00:42.346 --> 00:44.653
Don't worry. I didn't sleep in.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.350
I'm already at the airport.

00:46.394 --> 00:48.048
Good. I was worried.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.701
You had a whole day
to kill in Miami,

00:49.745 --> 00:51.312
and I thought maybe
you got into trouble.

00:51.355 --> 00:54.141
I mostly just walked around,
took the city in.

00:54.184 --> 00:56.404
Really, it's beautiful here.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.101
Good place to clear your head.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.407
And what were you thinking about

00:59.450 --> 01:01.017
as you stared off
into the Atlantic?

01:01.061 --> 01:03.628
Honestly? Us.

01:04.977 --> 01:06.631
I mean, it's hard not to.

01:06.675 --> 01:07.980
Every time I'd see
something cool,

01:08.024 --> 01:09.373
I'd think, "I really wish Chris

01:09.417 --> 01:10.592
was here to see this with me."

01:10.635 --> 01:12.855
Come on,
we talked about this.

01:12.898 --> 01:14.204
No, I know,

01:14.248 --> 01:17.077
a thousand times,
but nothing ever changes.

01:18.730 --> 01:22.256
Chris, I don't know how
much longer I can do this.

01:24.345 --> 01:27.435
I can't make you do anything
you don't want to do.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.439
Look, I got to go.
My prisoner's here.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.528
I'll, uh, I'll see you
when we land

01:33.571 --> 01:35.225
back in L.A.

01:36.835 --> 01:38.707
Hey.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.535
Jim Street,
LAPD SWAT.

01:40.578 --> 01:43.015
Don Urbano, U.S. Marshal.
Nice to finally meet you

01:43.059 --> 01:45.192
in person, Jim. I assume
he needs no introduction.

01:45.235 --> 01:48.064
Peter Galloway.
I've seen your face

01:48.108 --> 01:50.806
on SWAT HQ's
Most Wanted board.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.286
I'm here to take you
back to L.A.

01:54.549 --> 01:55.985
I was impressed
with your team

01:56.028 --> 01:57.639
tracking him down.
He got desperate,

01:57.682 --> 01:59.554
reached out to a few
Miami contacts

01:59.597 --> 02:00.816
and put himself
on our radar.

02:00.859 --> 02:02.252
All we did was scoop him up.

02:02.296 --> 02:03.906
Missed home,
Galloway?

02:03.949 --> 02:05.386
Well, lucky for you,

02:05.429 --> 02:06.909
you'll be back in L.A.
before you know it.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.606
Can't wait.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.260
We got it from here, guys.
Thank you.

02:10.304 --> 02:11.957
Thanks.
Let's get on board.

02:18.921 --> 02:21.184
Humming and
hot cakes?

02:21.228 --> 02:22.794
What's got you
so perky?

02:22.838 --> 02:25.362
Oh, you know, just
waking up next to my boo.

02:25.406 --> 02:27.669
- Mwah. Mwah.
- Mm-hmm.

02:27.712 --> 02:29.801
Right. Now I'm
suspicious.

02:29.845 --> 02:32.021
Okay, you got me.
That was pretty cheesy.

02:33.283 --> 02:34.850
Here. Show you something.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.550
I got you
a surprise.

02:39.594 --> 02:41.857
Oh, babe, you know
I'm not a jewelry person.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.206
No, no, no.
It's way better than bling.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.947
Open it up.

02:51.954 --> 02:53.521
That's a key
to this house.

02:54.826 --> 02:58.613
Um, I love the presentation,

02:58.656 --> 03:00.658
- but I've already got one.
- No, no, no, no.

03:00.702 --> 03:03.095
You've been holding on
to my spare. That key

03:03.139 --> 03:05.185
right there
is all yours.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.492
Baby, you're here every night,

03:08.536 --> 03:10.799
and I'm getting
kind of tired

03:10.842 --> 03:12.975
of always having
to invite you over here.

03:13.018 --> 03:14.890
I want us
to live together.

03:14.933 --> 03:17.022
You sure about this?

03:17.066 --> 03:19.721
I mean, sharing a place
is more than just sharing a bed.

03:19.764 --> 03:20.852
I've got my own things,

03:20.896 --> 03:22.245
my own life.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.942
And there's space here
for all of it.

03:23.986 --> 03:26.206
What do you say?

03:30.906 --> 03:32.995
- What's good, Luca?
- Hey, morning, boss.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.216
Hey, you're never
smiling before

03:36.259 --> 03:38.261
PFQ drills. What gives, man?

03:38.305 --> 03:40.394
There were some good tunes
on the radio, I guess.

03:40.437 --> 03:41.743
- I don't know.
- Oh, yeah?

03:41.786 --> 03:43.788
Sure it's not 'cause
you got some big news

03:43.832 --> 03:45.007
you're busting
to spill?

03:45.050 --> 03:46.138
Street's plane
just took off.

03:46.182 --> 03:48.140
Hondo,

03:48.184 --> 03:49.751
what did Nichelle say?

03:49.794 --> 03:52.188
Okay, what's going on?
Who y'all been talking to?

03:54.103 --> 03:56.105
Oh. Hey, Deac.

03:56.148 --> 03:58.499
So, the team's decided that
my personal life is fair game.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.283
They seem to be
under the impression

04:00.327 --> 04:01.893
that I might have
some good news.

04:01.937 --> 04:03.634
Well, do you?

04:04.983 --> 04:07.116
All right, all right.
She said yes. She's moving in.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.770
Oh, yeah!
All right. Hey,
slow your roll.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.641
- It's not happening right away.
- But it is happening.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.208
Never thought
I'd see the day.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.254
You were just waiting
for the right one.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.386
And waiting and waiting.

04:16.430 --> 04:17.779
Hondo Harrelson,

04:17.822 --> 04:19.128
SWAT's oldest bachelor,

04:19.171 --> 04:20.912
is finally
settling down, man.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.131
You're the oldest one
here, Luca,

04:22.174 --> 04:23.132
and you still live with Street.

04:23.175 --> 04:24.829
Ooh. Shots fired. Hey.

04:24.873 --> 04:26.353
All right, hey, hey, hey.
That's enough, that's enough.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.442
Y'all got your licks in.
Shift's about to start.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.400
Let's get to it.
All right.

04:52.683 --> 04:54.337
Snack cart'll start
at the front

04:54.381 --> 04:55.512
in a few minutes.
Wanted to make sure

04:55.556 --> 04:56.687
you two got served
first, though.

04:56.731 --> 04:58.341
- I'm all set. Thank you.
- Okay.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.038
I'm good for now,but, uh,

05:00.082 --> 05:02.127
don't let them run out
of those tiny pretzels.

05:02.171 --> 05:05.479
I'll make sure
to save a few bags.

05:12.964 --> 05:16.098
She never asked me
what I wanted.

05:16.141 --> 05:17.926
Uh, that's 'cause
she doesn't like you.

05:19.797 --> 05:22.017
But she sure
likes Jim, though.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.774
I got to use
the bathroom.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.866
Oh, watch
your head.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.563
Hold on. Wait there.

05:53.744 --> 05:55.224
Go ahead.

06:16.941 --> 06:19.509
Mind coming back
in a few minutes, buddy?

06:30.172 --> 06:31.086
Galloway! Drop it!

06:44.404 --> 06:45.579
Cuff the cop.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.319
Zip-tie the rest.

06:50.148 --> 06:52.586
Kill anyone
who resists.

06:56.241 --> 06:58.809
In the back. Go.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.507
Go, go, go!

07:05.990 --> 07:07.688
Punch in the code.

07:09.472 --> 07:12.170
Punch in the code,
or I blow your head off

07:12.214 --> 07:13.998
and then make him do it.

07:14.042 --> 07:16.261
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
Legion 319

07:16.305 --> 07:18.655
declaring an emergency.
Hijacking in progress.

07:22.964 --> 07:24.922
Don't worry,
I'm not here to change course,

07:24.966 --> 07:28.448
but I do need you to get me
air traffic control.

07:30.362 --> 07:32.713
Now.

07:32.756 --> 07:35.455
Commander, we just saw
the alert on Street's flight.

07:35.498 --> 07:36.891
What the hell's going on
up there?

07:36.934 --> 07:38.370
It's Galloway. I don't know how,
but he got free,

07:38.414 --> 07:39.676
and he has the plane.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.504
Air traffic control
just relayed a message

07:41.548 --> 07:43.419
from the cockpit.

07:44.594 --> 07:46.291
This is Peter Galloway.

07:46.335 --> 07:48.380
I'm willing to exchange
this plane's passengers

07:48.424 --> 07:49.947
when we land
in Los Angeles

07:49.991 --> 07:51.253
for something in return.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.168
My wife is imprisoned at L.A.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.474
Regional Detention.

07:54.517 --> 07:55.779
I want her released
and waiting

07:55.823 --> 07:57.912
on the tarmac when I land.
Once the plane

07:57.955 --> 08:00.001
is gassed up,
and the runway is clear,

08:00.044 --> 08:01.306
I will release
the passengers

08:01.350 --> 08:03.352
before taking off again.
Flight crew

08:03.395 --> 08:05.310
and law enforcement
stay with me.

08:05.354 --> 08:07.182
I don't want to see anyone
on the tarmac other than

08:07.225 --> 08:08.531
my wife, alone,

08:08.575 --> 08:10.228
and a small crew
to refuel the plane

08:10.272 --> 08:11.534
and deboard passengers.

08:11.578 --> 08:12.927
If I see anyone else,

08:12.970 --> 08:14.276
I start
executing hostages,

08:14.319 --> 08:16.757
starting with the cops on board.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.715
There'll be no further
contact or communication

08:18.759 --> 08:20.064
beyond this message.

08:20.108 --> 08:22.414
I will not negotiate.

08:22.458 --> 08:25.156
All right, Chris,
you round up the team.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.158
I want everything on
this flight: the plane,

08:27.202 --> 08:28.812
the manifest, Galloway.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.684
I want to know how the hell
he's pulling this off.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.076
Sir, how long
would it take to pull

08:32.120 --> 08:33.208
the SWAT practice plane
out of storage?

08:33.251 --> 08:34.818
We could have it
up and running

08:34.862 --> 08:36.428
at a training facility
in 30 minutes.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.126
You want to plan
a tarmac rescue?

08:38.169 --> 08:40.345
This plane lands in under
five hours, Hondo.

08:40.389 --> 08:42.043
Then that's how long
we have to figure out how

08:42.086 --> 08:43.523
we're gonna save Street
and everyone else on board.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.475
Training facility
is being prepped as we speak.

09:23.519 --> 09:25.652
Now, Street touches down
in just under five hours.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.305
By then, we got to be ready
to raid that plane.

09:27.349 --> 09:28.829
Protocol says
we surround it.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.613
We force the hijacker
to negotiate.

09:30.657 --> 09:31.919
Galloway's message
made it pretty clear

09:31.962 --> 09:33.311
he's not willing
to do that.

09:33.355 --> 09:34.922
Forcing him into a corner
might set him off

09:34.965 --> 09:36.358
and put the passengers
in even more danger.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.012
Especially law enforcement.

09:38.055 --> 09:40.580
This is the same guy
who ran a black market empire

09:40.623 --> 09:41.711
here in L.A. for years.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.235
Guns, drugs, contraband.

09:44.279 --> 09:45.585
You don't control
all of that

09:45.628 --> 09:47.108
without a rep
for being ruthless.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.544
Organized Crime had
a solid case against him

09:48.588 --> 09:50.198
till he found the
undercover cop in his crew.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.982
He tortured the officer,
then executed him

09:52.026 --> 09:53.375
before fleeing L.A.

09:53.418 --> 09:55.203
His wife, Beth,
ran the books.

09:55.246 --> 09:56.944
She went down for everything
LAPD was trying

09:56.987 --> 09:58.510
to stick on him.
She's currently serving

09:58.554 --> 09:59.860
20 years.
You got to think

09:59.903 --> 10:01.513
Galloway's been planning
their reunion

10:01.557 --> 10:03.341
for some time.
Hijacking like this,

10:03.385 --> 10:04.473
there's no way
he's acting alone.

10:04.516 --> 10:05.474
He's got to have help up there.

10:05.517 --> 10:06.780
Aside from the crew,

10:06.823 --> 10:08.259
there's 19 other passengers
on board.

10:08.303 --> 10:10.131
None with a record
or tie to Galloway.

10:10.174 --> 10:12.699
His co-conspirators
could be posing as passengers.

10:12.742 --> 10:14.483
We can't plan a raid
till we know

10:14.526 --> 10:15.832
how many hijackers
we're up against.

10:15.876 --> 10:17.878
I know Galloway's
talking tough, but

10:17.921 --> 10:19.575
maybe there's still room
to reason with him.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.621
He's a psycho who's already
killed a cop once before.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.318
Chris, I agree,
but Deacon's got a point.

10:23.361 --> 10:25.189
We do need to know how many
hijackers are on that plane.

10:26.930 --> 10:28.410
I think I know a way
to find out.

10:30.542 --> 10:31.848
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

10:31.892 --> 10:34.111
we should be arriving
in Los Angeles

10:34.155 --> 10:36.461
on schedule.
If everything goes

10:36.505 --> 10:39.726
according to plan, you should
see your loved ones tonight.

10:39.769 --> 10:42.467
Don't do anything
that would jeopardize that.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.178
You're being radioed.

10:57.221 --> 10:58.527
LAPD.

11:01.486 --> 11:03.706
Legion 319,
this is Sergeant Harrelson

11:03.750 --> 11:05.708
with LAPD SWAT.
Are you reading me?

11:05.752 --> 11:07.188
I thought I made myself clear.

11:07.231 --> 11:09.320
There will be
no further communication.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.366
Problem is, you have
my teammate, Jim Street,

11:11.409 --> 11:13.281
and a U.S. Marshal
up there with you.

11:13.324 --> 11:15.283
We're willing to play ball,
but I need to confirm

11:15.326 --> 11:16.806
that they're okay first.

11:18.765 --> 11:19.983
Bring LAPD.

11:28.252 --> 11:29.819
This is Jim Street,
LAPD SWAT.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.995
Street, it's Hondo.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.997
How's Marshal Urbano doing?

11:34.041 --> 11:35.346
Hey, boss.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.871
He's, uh, he's shot
in the shoulder.

11:37.914 --> 11:40.134
He should make it to L.A.,
but he's gonna need a doc.

11:40.177 --> 11:41.744
And the rest
of the passengers?

11:41.788 --> 11:44.225
They're just tied up in their
chairs in the main cabin.

11:44.268 --> 11:45.574
I can't really
see them from first.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.271
Careful, Officer.

11:48.751 --> 11:51.058
Hondo, just give this guy what
he wants. Don't worry about me,

11:51.101 --> 11:53.103
just save
the passengers.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.757
But, hey, listen,
c-can you call Molly

11:54.801 --> 11:56.106
and tell her
I'm not gonna make it?

11:56.150 --> 11:57.325
We're supposed to have
our third date

11:57.368 --> 11:58.500
at the Culver
French Market.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.199
Copy that, Street.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.027
Galloway, I'm gonna need
the injured Marshal

12:04.071 --> 12:05.594
included in the hostage release.

12:05.637 --> 12:07.074
If he needs medical attention,

12:07.117 --> 12:08.989
we're gonna need
an ambulance on the tarmac.

12:09.032 --> 12:11.513
I already made
my terms clear.

12:11.556 --> 12:13.645
If the Marshal dies,
you're not going anywhere.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.212
Am I clear?

12:15.256 --> 12:17.388
It's an act of good faith.
Can we agree?

12:17.432 --> 12:19.086
Fine.

12:19.129 --> 12:21.088
Do not call
here again.

12:21.131 --> 12:23.743
Smart kid.
Using Molly's name,

12:23.786 --> 12:25.614
he knew would get
our attention.

12:25.657 --> 12:27.790
Third date must mean
three gunmen.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.183
Where'd he say
he was taking her again?

12:29.226 --> 12:30.750
Culver French Market.

12:30.793 --> 12:33.143
"C," "F" and "M."

12:33.187 --> 12:35.102
Cockpit, first class,
and the main cabin, maybe.

12:35.145 --> 12:37.974
Hijackers' positions.

12:38.018 --> 12:40.237
Mock-up plane's ready.
It's good timing.

12:40.281 --> 12:42.936
If we're gonna pull this off,
we're gonna need perfect timing.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.810
All right, here she is,
the SWAT training plane.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.812
She hasn't seen the sun
in a few years,

12:49.856 --> 12:51.814
but we used to use it to run
regular hijacking drills.

12:51.858 --> 12:54.425
It's been a while since
I've seen this old bird.

12:54.469 --> 12:55.862
All right, listen up.
Thanks to Street,

12:55.905 --> 12:57.298
we know that there are
three hijackers, covering

12:57.341 --> 12:59.474
these areas.
Here, here and here.

12:59.517 --> 13:01.519
Street and Marshal Urbano
are being held in first class.

13:01.563 --> 13:03.434
Our objective is to neutralize
all three targets

13:03.478 --> 13:04.740
simultaneously.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.438
Any of the hijackers
gets tipped off,

13:07.482 --> 13:09.049
- Street pays the price.
- Galloway will have a view

13:09.092 --> 13:10.572
of the whole airport
as he lands.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.443
How are we approaching
without being seen?

13:12.487 --> 13:14.097
These are the vehicles
that Galloway's expecting

13:14.141 --> 13:16.143
to see on the tarmac.
So, Chris and Tan,

13:16.186 --> 13:17.797
you'll stow in
the stair car. Luca,

13:17.840 --> 13:19.407
you tow it in, undercover.

13:19.450 --> 13:20.582
Deacon and I
will arrive

13:20.625 --> 13:22.453
under the fuel truck, driven by

13:22.497 --> 13:24.064
- the real grounds crew.
- What about Beth Galloway?

13:24.107 --> 13:25.717
Beth will be
dropped off as soon as

13:25.761 --> 13:27.415
the vehicles are in place.
We hold our positions

13:27.458 --> 13:29.721
until the hostages have deplaned
and Beth is on board.

13:29.765 --> 13:31.854
Once she's inside,
the coast is clear.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.987
That leaves us a small window
to come out from cover,

13:34.030 --> 13:35.727
get into position,
and then breach.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.642
All right, we're gonna
begin with a direct approach.

13:37.686 --> 13:40.558
We'll use the forward
and the aft doors.

13:40.602 --> 13:42.082
Now, the real plane, obviously,

13:42.125 --> 13:43.779
those will be ten feet
off the ground. Luca,

13:43.823 --> 13:47.087
Chris and Tan, you're gonna
take the front via the stairs.

13:47.130 --> 13:48.566
Hondo and I will take the rear,

13:48.610 --> 13:50.003
using the fuel tanker
to reach the door.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.395
And we want this to feel
as real as possible,

13:51.439 --> 13:53.441
so meet the hijackers,
our current crop

13:53.484 --> 13:55.530
of SWAT recruits.
Now, the bad guys are in red,

13:55.573 --> 13:56.618
Street's in blue.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.359
Now, Galloway will target him

13:58.402 --> 14:00.056
as soon as he realizes
something's up,

14:00.100 --> 14:02.493
so we protect blue
at all costs.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.104
So all I got to do
is sit here?

14:04.147 --> 14:06.976
For now. After each run,
I want you to switch roles.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.369
Don't be afraid
to throw us a curveball

14:08.412 --> 14:09.849
or two.
Keep us on our toes.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.459
We won't make it easy
on you guys.

14:11.502 --> 14:14.201
All right, let's move.
Tac up. Clock's ticking.

14:20.294 --> 14:23.601
Hostages and Urbano
are off the plane.

14:23.645 --> 14:25.299
Beth Galloway
is on board.

14:25.342 --> 14:28.041
Front doors are closed. Now.

14:30.739 --> 14:32.610
On my count. Three,

14:32.654 --> 14:35.222
two, one, go.

14:39.661 --> 14:41.881
One hijacker down.

14:43.317 --> 14:44.927
Cockpit!

14:46.450 --> 14:47.625
Street's down.

14:50.324 --> 14:51.586
I can't cover the cockpit

14:51.629 --> 14:52.804
and cover Chris.
We need to plan

14:52.848 --> 14:54.110
for a hijacker
in the cockpit

14:54.154 --> 14:55.546
- prepping for takeoff.
- Tan, that's your

14:55.590 --> 14:57.200
responsibility,
starting now.

14:57.244 --> 14:58.549
Let's do it again.

14:58.593 --> 15:01.944
Three, two, one, go.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.000
Cockpit's clear.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.305
Chris out.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.959
Damn it. They changed positions,

15:17.003 --> 15:19.266
and I'm blind if I'm
checking the cockpit.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.224
Then we need to know
whether or not someone

15:21.268 --> 15:22.443
is in there
before we breach.

15:22.486 --> 15:23.879
Everyone outside.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.489
We're going back
to the drawing board.

15:34.281 --> 15:35.325
Hey.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.327
How you doing?

15:37.371 --> 15:39.547
About as well
as everyone else.

15:39.590 --> 15:41.592
How's the Marshal?

15:43.333 --> 15:45.292
He's not looking too good.

15:47.076 --> 15:49.078
Yeah, but I haven't seen
any white light

15:49.122 --> 15:51.907
in the distance
either yet, so...

15:53.169 --> 15:55.302
I'm sorry.

15:55.345 --> 15:58.305
I just feel
so helpless here.

15:58.348 --> 16:00.916
Listen,

16:00.960 --> 16:04.137
there's something you might be
able to do, but it's dangerous.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.661
If it helps us, I'm in.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.844
There's a stun gun
in the rear galley.

16:15.887 --> 16:17.454
It's in my bag.
Did you get a look at it

16:17.498 --> 16:20.022
- when I brought it on?
- Yeah, I remember it.

16:20.066 --> 16:22.285
Mr. SWAT Big Shot had to have
his bag kept away

16:22.329 --> 16:23.895
from the rest of the passengers.

16:26.768 --> 16:30.511
The passengers are complaining.
They need to use the bathroom.

16:30.554 --> 16:31.773
Don't care.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.514
Follow my lead.

16:39.476 --> 16:42.262
Make an example of the next
person who speaks up.

16:42.305 --> 16:43.611
Got it?

16:45.352 --> 16:47.963
Hey, hey, hey. Help!

16:48.007 --> 16:49.182
- He's having a heart attack!
- Oh, my God.

16:49.225 --> 16:50.705
Galloway!

16:50.748 --> 16:52.359
He needs a defibrillator.
There's one in the back.

16:52.402 --> 16:54.361
Go.

16:54.404 --> 16:57.059
Hey. You're good, buddy.
Hey, just breathe.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.147
Take it easy.
Stay with me.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.717
The cockpit is still a problem,
but what if we seal it off?

17:02.760 --> 17:04.371
Anyone inside would be
out of commission

17:04.414 --> 17:06.329
until we take out
the rest of the gunmen.

17:06.373 --> 17:07.983
- Okay, what about the pilots?
- Well, Galloway needs them, right?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.158
He's not gonna hurt
the only people

17:09.202 --> 17:10.594
that can get him
back in the air.

17:10.638 --> 17:12.422
Besides, all we need
is a few extra seconds

17:12.466 --> 17:13.728
to neutralize
the other hijackers.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.338
Okay, our riot shields
could fit down

17:15.382 --> 17:16.731
the hallway
to the cockpit door,

17:16.774 --> 17:18.472
but there's no way
you could hold onto one

17:18.515 --> 17:20.213
while hanging under
that fuel truck.

17:20.256 --> 17:23.085
The EMT might have room for one
in the back of his wagon.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.044
<i>Three,</i>

17:25.087 --> 17:26.871
two, one,

17:26.915 --> 17:28.134
go.

17:37.752 --> 17:38.927
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

17:40.668 --> 17:42.061
Suspect down.

17:46.587 --> 17:49.155
Suspect, come out of the cockpit
with your hands up.

17:53.376 --> 17:56.205
All right, we found
our sweet spot.

17:56.249 --> 17:58.512
Now we run it again,

17:58.555 --> 18:00.644
and again, till we
get it perfect.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.388
I know it's in here somewhere.

18:05.432 --> 18:06.955
Just... just
give me a second.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.396
What's taking her so long?

18:16.182 --> 18:19.576
Something's wrong.
Bring her back here.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.535
Go.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.073
Enough!

18:40.380 --> 18:41.816
I found her trying
to pocket this.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.474
This was your plan?

18:48.475 --> 18:50.390
To get this?

18:50.433 --> 18:53.132
And then? Hmm?

19:00.008 --> 19:02.706
You just made
a big mistake, Officer.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.055
What's up, Commander?

19:04.099 --> 19:07.755
I got Midwest Regional
ATC on the line.

19:07.798 --> 19:10.279
Galloway wants to be
patched through to you.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.455
This is Sergeant Harrelson.

19:12.499 --> 19:13.891
My demands
are reasonable, Sergeant.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.154
I was playing fair.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.416
We're working on
getting everything

19:16.459 --> 19:17.808
you asked for
down here.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.114
Then why won't
Officer Street behave?

19:19.158 --> 19:21.421
There have to be consequences.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.640
So, I'm setting new terms
for our exchange.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.903
No hostages. No Marshal.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.905
He can bleed out for all I care.

19:27.949 --> 19:29.472
Okay, hold on a second.
Let's talk about this.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.170
Talking was my first mistake.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.781
If I see anything I don't expect
on that tarmac,

19:33.824 --> 19:37.480
you'll regret everything
about this day, Sergeant.

19:37.524 --> 19:38.786
Galloway.

19:39.874 --> 19:41.310
Sir, none of our raids work

19:41.354 --> 19:42.659
with a cabin full of hostages.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.663
Now we're back
to square one. Yeah.

19:52.278 --> 19:53.714
Hey, that last one
was on me, Deac.

19:53.757 --> 19:55.150
I couldn't get
a clean shot

19:55.194 --> 19:56.891
through the hostage
cutouts we added.

19:56.934 --> 19:59.241
There's too many variables
under Galloway's new terms.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.896
Every run, we get hit,
a hostage gets clipped...

20:01.939 --> 20:03.637
Or Street dies.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.465
What if we breached through
the floor of the middle galley?

20:05.508 --> 20:07.249
We could enter through
the cargo area.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.511
That's tricky.

20:08.555 --> 20:10.078
The cargo hold
is rigged with a sensor

20:10.121 --> 20:12.254
that detects excess weight.
Second you get inside...

20:12.298 --> 20:14.256
Cockpit would be alerted,
and Galloway would see it.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.518
Yeah, unless
you disabled it.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.172
Hey, I remember
something from our old

20:17.216 --> 20:19.479
training days on this thing.
The weight sensor's

20:19.522 --> 20:21.176
on a delay to ensure
no false alarms.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.134
I guess sometimes a quick change
in cabin pressure

20:23.178 --> 20:24.397
could set it off.
It's like 20 seconds.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.660
So if someone
moved fast enough,

20:26.703 --> 20:28.401
they could override the sensor
before it alerts the cockpit?

20:28.444 --> 20:29.837
Yeah. You'd need to get to

20:29.880 --> 20:31.273
the electrical
panel up here

20:31.317 --> 20:32.405
by scrambling through
that crawl space.

20:32.448 --> 20:34.102
That's 40 feet

20:34.145 --> 20:36.104
for someone to breach,
crawl, and cut wires

20:36.147 --> 20:37.801
- in no time at all.
- Well, it comes down

20:37.845 --> 20:39.455
to someone who's good
in really tight spaces.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.416
Hey, it was your idea.

20:43.459 --> 20:45.505
Lose the tac gear. Go.

20:48.464 --> 20:49.900
Department of Corrections

20:49.944 --> 20:51.119
just brought
Galloway's wife down here.

20:51.162 --> 20:52.860
All right.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.731
So, we've got
just over two hours,

20:54.775 --> 20:56.211
and so far,
our best play involves

20:56.255 --> 20:57.778
Tan crawling through
a space small enough

20:57.821 --> 20:59.823
to make one of my kids claustrophobic.

20:59.867 --> 21:03.479
We got to reconsider
a-a negotiation strategy.

21:03.523 --> 21:05.438
Galloway's wife.

21:05.481 --> 21:07.483
You think she could convince him
to come back to the table?

21:07.527 --> 21:10.138
At the very least, get
him to release the passengers.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.751
Hey, I know we got to get
back out there.

21:14.795 --> 21:15.839
Time's short,
but you got a sec?

21:15.883 --> 21:17.232
Yeah.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.886
Okay, you reacted late

21:18.929 --> 21:20.583
to one of the breaches earlier,

21:20.627 --> 21:23.586
and I caught you favoring one
of your ears during a debrief.

21:23.630 --> 21:25.327
You having hearing problems
all of a sudden?

21:25.371 --> 21:27.024
It's nothing new.

21:27.068 --> 21:29.288
An IED damaged my right eardrum
back in Afghanistan.

21:29.331 --> 21:31.377
Sometimes I get
this faint ringing.

21:31.420 --> 21:32.813
Makes it tough to hear

21:32.856 --> 21:34.336
really quiet things.

21:34.380 --> 21:35.685
It comes and goes, though.
It's no big deal.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.078
And you never told anyone
about this?

21:37.121 --> 21:38.384
Doctor says it's manageable.

21:38.427 --> 21:40.124
I've learned to live with it.

21:40.168 --> 21:41.822
Okay, you know SWAT's got
strict medical standards.

21:41.865 --> 21:44.390
If you don't meet all
the requirements, you're cut.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.522
It's...

21:46.566 --> 21:48.872
it's not like
I can't hear, Luca.

21:48.916 --> 21:50.831
This is just an off day.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.441
There's gonna be a physical
before graduation.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.008
It includes
a hearing test.

21:54.051 --> 21:55.444
If you don't
pass that,

21:55.488 --> 21:57.577
that's it,
there's no do-overs.

21:59.056 --> 22:01.581
SWAT has been the hardest
training of my life.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.844
The finish line is in sight.
I won't lose it

22:03.887 --> 22:05.324
to some technicality.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.108
Okay, I'm not the doc.
Maybe you'll pass,

22:07.151 --> 22:09.676
maybe it'll be fine. I just want
you to know what's ahead of you.

22:11.155 --> 22:12.983
Okay, right now, we need you

22:13.027 --> 22:14.724
back out there.
All right? Let's go.

22:21.078 --> 22:22.253
Mrs. Galloway,

22:22.297 --> 22:24.038
I'm sure you're wondering why

22:24.081 --> 22:25.735
your rec time
was cut short.

22:25.779 --> 22:27.955
Your husband
hijacked a plane,

22:27.998 --> 22:29.391
and we were hoping
you can help us open

22:29.435 --> 22:31.001
another line of communication
with him.

22:31.045 --> 22:33.308
There could be a lot in it
for you if you cooperate.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.918
We could help get
your sentence reduced.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.703
What do I care
about my sentence?

22:37.791 --> 22:39.749
Where I'm going,
I'm a free woman.

22:39.793 --> 22:41.534
No extradition treaty.

22:42.796 --> 22:44.580
You know exactly
what's going on, don't you?

22:44.624 --> 22:46.103
I've been counting down
the hours

22:46.147 --> 22:47.757
till I see my husband again.

22:47.801 --> 22:49.150
Just a few left to go.

22:49.193 --> 22:50.717
You really want to try

22:50.760 --> 22:52.414
your luck on the run
for the rest of your life?

22:52.458 --> 22:53.850
I'll be in good company.

22:53.894 --> 22:54.938
Hmm.

22:55.765 --> 22:58.681
With the man who abandoned you
to take the fall for his crimes?

23:01.467 --> 23:03.599
You're wasting your time.

23:03.643 --> 23:05.514
Just give us
what Peter asked for.

23:05.558 --> 23:07.560
Don't forget,
I'll be on the tarmac.

23:07.603 --> 23:09.779
If you make a move, I'll know.

23:09.823 --> 23:11.128
And if I know,

23:11.172 --> 23:13.479
- my husband will know, too.
- Is that so?

23:13.522 --> 23:16.090
We have our ways.

23:16.133 --> 23:18.527
God help those poor passengers
if I see one person

23:18.571 --> 23:21.051
even resembling
a cop.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.144
Hey, deep breaths.

23:27.188 --> 23:29.669
Don't panic.

23:29.712 --> 23:30.887
Everything's
gonna be okay.

23:30.931 --> 23:33.760
I'm not panicking.
I'm frustrated.

23:33.803 --> 23:36.240
I was this close
to getting that stun gun.

23:36.284 --> 23:38.460
I blew it.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.201
You put your life on the line.

23:40.244 --> 23:41.768
That was incredibly badass.

23:41.811 --> 23:44.248
Yeah, and somehow I managed

23:44.292 --> 23:45.989
to only give them more weapons.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.433
I know that my team

23:54.476 --> 23:56.739
is working on something
on the ground.

23:56.783 --> 23:59.438
We're gonna get you home
safe tonight.

23:59.481 --> 24:02.789
I'm not sure I'd call my
barely furnished

24:02.832 --> 24:05.052
one-bedroom in Santa Monica
home, but...

24:06.096 --> 24:08.795
Where would you call home, then?

24:08.838 --> 24:10.884
I don't know.

24:10.927 --> 24:14.148
I'm still looking
for that place,

24:14.191 --> 24:16.280
or that person.

24:17.281 --> 24:19.370
What about you?

24:19.414 --> 24:22.591
Is anyone waiting for you
to come home safe tonight?

24:24.201 --> 24:28.379
There is, but it's complicated.

24:28.423 --> 24:30.860
We've been in this
holding pattern.

24:30.904 --> 24:33.341
I've been patient, but...

24:35.343 --> 24:37.954
...it just feels like
it's never gonna happen.

24:37.998 --> 24:40.522
I get it.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.481
I dated this guy in Boston.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.570
He promised he was gonna
move to L.A.

24:44.613 --> 24:47.137
He told me just be patient.

24:47.181 --> 24:50.445
Two lonely Christmases later
I realized

24:50.489 --> 24:52.491
I'd passed up a lot
of my life

24:52.534 --> 24:57.365
waiting for something that was
just never gonna happen.

24:57.408 --> 25:00.629
I guess at some point
you just got to move on.

25:04.241 --> 25:07.636
And Boston guy
is gonna realize

25:07.680 --> 25:10.204
he made a big mistake
when he sees your face

25:10.247 --> 25:12.032
on the news when
this is all done.

25:12.075 --> 25:15.296
Hero flight attendant
saves SWAT officer.

25:15.339 --> 25:17.907
God, don't say that.

25:17.951 --> 25:20.649
Now on top of staying alive,

25:20.693 --> 25:22.608
I have to worry about
being camera ready?

25:24.610 --> 25:26.873
- I mean, look at my hair.
- Come on, I think you look great.

25:31.878 --> 25:34.358
- What is it?
- Your hairpin.

25:35.708 --> 25:38.537
There might still be a way
for you to help us out of this.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.626
<i>20 seconds starting now!</i>

25:51.288 --> 25:53.595
Time. Sensor's tripped. Again.

25:53.639 --> 25:54.770
Let's run it again.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.032
I need a minute.

25:56.076 --> 25:57.425
We don't have time
to take a break.

25:57.468 --> 25:58.731
Everyone up there's
counting on us.

25:58.774 --> 26:00.341
- We need to do this again.
- Hey, Chris.

26:00.384 --> 26:01.603
We're all feeling the clock.
Tan just needs a breather.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.213
All right,
let me try it then.

26:03.257 --> 26:04.563
Come on, Tan.
Take the watch, let's go.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.695
Chris, that's enough.
Stand down.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.828
We can make this way work,
we just need to try harder.

26:08.871 --> 26:10.873
I said stand down. You need
to take a minute to cool off.

26:10.917 --> 26:13.006
We need to work
together on this,

26:13.049 --> 26:14.747
not fight each other.
We're all trying our best here.

26:14.790 --> 26:17.488
What if our best
isn't good enough?

26:17.532 --> 26:19.534
Then what happens?

26:27.760 --> 26:29.849
Hey, look, I know you guys
are fried, but this is

26:29.892 --> 26:33.592
what SWAT's all about: planning,
training and endurance.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.898
Starting positions.
We're going again.

26:35.942 --> 26:39.119
I got dibs on not
being Street this run.

26:39.162 --> 26:40.381
Hey, are you good?

26:41.948 --> 26:43.689
I've been avoiding
my hearing issue

26:43.732 --> 26:45.081
since my diagnosis,

26:45.125 --> 26:46.605
finding ways of compensating

26:46.648 --> 26:48.737
rather than facing it head-on.

26:48.781 --> 26:51.174
Even if I pass
the SWAT physical,

26:51.218 --> 26:52.654
the problem's not going away.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.787
And I made a decision.
We got another hour

26:54.830 --> 26:56.963
to get this raid right,
then I'm packing up my locker.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.834
Wait, why? You don't
need to leave, okay?

26:58.878 --> 27:01.097
The requirements to be
a TEMS officer are less strict.

27:01.141 --> 27:03.099
You can still roll out
as a medic.

27:03.143 --> 27:06.755
I've been through the ringer.
Proven myself.

27:06.799 --> 27:09.671
I wanted to make SWAT,
not hang back

27:09.715 --> 27:11.412
and watch everyone else
live out that dream.

27:11.455 --> 27:13.632
So that's it,
you're just gonna quit?

27:13.675 --> 27:16.373
Be honest. If the roles were
reversed, would you stay?

27:16.417 --> 27:18.680
Probably not.

27:18.724 --> 27:21.857
But don't throw this all away.
Okay, you're an amazing medic.

27:21.901 --> 27:24.338
You make a difference every day
you're out there with us.

27:24.381 --> 27:27.254
I'm gonna pass
on the consolation prize.

27:27.297 --> 27:29.430
Look, nothing changes the fact
that SWAT's a family.

27:29.473 --> 27:31.606
And you're already
a part of it.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.000
There's a place for you here.

27:35.697 --> 27:38.569
Sorry, Luca,
my mind's made up.

27:47.404 --> 27:48.841
If your bosses sent you here
on some girl-talk mission,

27:48.884 --> 27:50.494
I am really not interested.

27:52.409 --> 27:55.369
Your ride for the airport
leaves in a few minutes.

27:55.412 --> 27:57.240
Thought maybe you'd want
to be wearing something

27:57.284 --> 27:59.112
a little bit more familiar.

28:08.121 --> 28:10.210
And my bosses don't know
I'm here.

28:10.253 --> 28:12.778
They think you're
a lost cause.

28:12.821 --> 28:14.475
They wouldn't be the first.

28:14.518 --> 28:16.520
I know why you're doing this.

28:16.564 --> 28:18.218
It's not just 'cause
you want freedom.

28:18.261 --> 28:20.176
It's 'cause you love
this guy.

28:22.526 --> 28:26.835
Well, if that was all
this was about,

28:26.879 --> 28:29.446
I'd just wait till
my sentence was up.

28:29.490 --> 28:31.405
He's a man with a lot
of enemies.

28:31.448 --> 28:33.233
He was gonna get
caught eventually.

28:33.276 --> 28:35.975
And we both know he'd have
a target on his back in prison.

28:36.018 --> 28:38.978
Maybe you were afraid
this might be

28:39.021 --> 28:40.849
the only chance
to see him again.

28:42.285 --> 28:45.071
You ever been in love, Officer?

28:45.114 --> 28:47.290
It's rough, isn't it?

28:47.334 --> 28:49.815
Makes you act irrational.

28:49.858 --> 28:51.773
It will be worth it in the end
if Peter and I can

28:51.817 --> 28:52.948
actually pull this off.

28:54.341 --> 28:56.996
I'll level with you.

28:57.039 --> 28:59.694
There's no second destination
once that plane lands.

28:59.738 --> 29:04.133
SWAT will do whatever it takes
to stop it from taking off.

29:05.526 --> 29:08.050
You're bluffing.
He has hostages.

29:08.094 --> 29:09.922
Including somebody I care about.

29:09.965 --> 29:13.534
But that won't stop us
from doing our job.

29:13.577 --> 29:16.580
We can make sure he winds up
safe behind bars.

29:16.624 --> 29:17.973
But at least you'll be able
to visit him

29:18.017 --> 29:19.627
once you're released.

29:19.670 --> 29:22.935
You have the power to save
Peter's life right now.

29:22.978 --> 29:25.459
And you guys have all the power
to give us what we want.

29:25.502 --> 29:27.069
Come on, Beth.

29:27.113 --> 29:28.941
We're both too smart to believe
in "happily ever after."

29:31.073 --> 29:33.336
I take it your love story
didn't quite pan out.

29:34.947 --> 29:38.472
You either see your husband
get hurt, or you save him.

29:39.908 --> 29:42.693
What can you live with
for the rest of your life?

29:46.001 --> 29:48.090
Travel time to the airport
is at least 30 minutes.

29:48.134 --> 29:49.483
We need to be in position

29:49.526 --> 29:51.354
before Galloway starts
his descent.

29:51.398 --> 29:54.009
Tell me you and the team
- have made some progress.
- We haven't.

29:54.053 --> 29:55.750
There isn't a scenario
with good odds.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.231
Galloway has a gun
pointed at Street's head,

29:58.274 --> 29:59.449
which means we don't
have time to move in

29:59.493 --> 30:01.016
before he pulls the trigger.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.452
What if I found a way to
buy us a few more minutes?

30:02.496 --> 30:03.714
Well, short of stopping time,

30:03.758 --> 30:05.368
I don't know how
you pull that off.

30:05.412 --> 30:08.458
I took a run at Beth Galloway.
She agreed to cooperate.

30:08.502 --> 30:09.895
She said that she
and Galloway have

30:09.938 --> 30:11.418
a secret "all clear" signal.

30:11.461 --> 30:14.116
He won't open the plane door
until he sees it.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.771
She's supposed to put her hand
to her heart, like this.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.381
Beth just wants
her husband alive,

30:18.425 --> 30:19.948
and to save his life,
she'll give the all-clear.

30:19.992 --> 30:21.602
- I don't know.
- Hold on.

30:21.645 --> 30:23.299
If we don't have to worry
about Beth seeing us,

30:23.343 --> 30:24.735
Hondo and I can
scale the plane

30:24.779 --> 30:25.736
and make entry from above.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.347
And I can enter from below

30:27.390 --> 30:28.827
- through the cargo hold.
- All right, hold on.

30:28.870 --> 30:31.177
How do we know
she's not playing us?

30:31.220 --> 30:34.658
We're just gonna have
to trust her. I do.

30:34.702 --> 30:36.747
Trying a completely new breach
we haven't trained, I mean,

30:36.791 --> 30:38.227
that's a huge risk.

30:38.271 --> 30:40.403
I know it is, but what
other choice do we have?

30:40.447 --> 30:43.232
Guess there's never been
a better time to be perfect.

30:46.627 --> 30:49.630
Luca. I thought 20-Squad rolled
out to the airport already.

30:49.673 --> 30:51.327
We're loading the AV now,
but we're missing something.

30:51.371 --> 30:54.374
Look, we have no idea what shape
the Marshal's in. Okay?

30:54.417 --> 30:55.854
EMTs are standing by,
but they can't move in

30:55.897 --> 30:58.247
until we take Galloway down.
That delay could

30:58.291 --> 30:59.727
cost Urbano his life.

30:59.770 --> 31:02.251
So you're asking me
to join the raid team?

31:02.295 --> 31:04.036
This is an untested strategy.

31:04.079 --> 31:06.516
We need to prepare for
anything to go wrong.

31:06.560 --> 31:07.517
We need a TEMS officer.

31:07.561 --> 31:09.476
You're the best there is.

31:12.958 --> 31:15.177
Tell Wilson to prep
for our descent.

31:18.267 --> 31:20.400
Go, go, go, go, go.

32:18.893 --> 32:20.808
She's here.

32:20.851 --> 32:22.070
Almost there, baby.

32:22.114 --> 32:25.073
Okay, move into position two.

32:33.777 --> 32:35.997
Come on.
What's taking so long?

32:36.041 --> 32:37.607
You think she changed her mind?

32:51.447 --> 32:54.929
Go to the back.
Watch the fuel trucks.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.365
I'll get us ready
for takeoff.

32:59.412 --> 33:00.979
Go.

33:12.294 --> 33:14.035
- When are you letting us off?
- When we say so.

33:14.079 --> 33:15.428
Wait. You said...

33:15.471 --> 33:16.646
Everybody just shut up!

33:32.097 --> 33:34.534
The passengers are gonna lose it
when we start to take back off.

33:35.622 --> 33:37.058
If anybody gets unruly,

33:37.102 --> 33:39.669
Jerry's back there
to keep 'em in line.

33:39.713 --> 33:42.237
- It's time to give him this.
- Okay.

33:45.153 --> 33:47.329
There must be another hijacker.

33:47.373 --> 33:49.897
He's been pretending to be
a passenger this whole time.

33:49.940 --> 33:51.855
What does that mean
for your team?

33:51.899 --> 33:53.422
They think there's only three.

33:53.466 --> 33:55.033
They're not expecting a fourth.

34:02.083 --> 34:04.042
Entering the lower plenum.

34:04.085 --> 34:06.653
Starting 20-second countdown
now!

34:21.494 --> 34:23.104
25-David.
I'm caught on something.

34:23.148 --> 34:25.672
You got ten seconds
before that light comes on

34:25.715 --> 34:28.196
and our cover's blown.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.198
Why isn't she getting on?

34:31.895 --> 34:34.463
She's waiting for us to move in.

34:37.162 --> 34:38.511
What the hell is that light?

34:57.791 --> 35:00.272
25-David. I clipped 'em.

35:00.315 --> 35:01.969
Must have been an error.

35:11.413 --> 35:12.762
Go sit in there.
Let me know

35:12.806 --> 35:14.808
the second the fuel gauge
is full.

35:21.206 --> 35:22.816
Galloway's out of the cockpit.

35:22.859 --> 35:25.427
He traded places with
another hijacker.

35:25.471 --> 35:26.820
Okay,

35:26.863 --> 35:28.604
on my call, team.

35:31.999 --> 35:33.131
Beth, come on.

35:34.436 --> 35:36.046
Beth, I don't know
what you're doing,

35:36.090 --> 35:38.310
but you got to get your ass
on this plane right now.

35:38.353 --> 35:40.094
20-Squad. Three...

35:40.138 --> 35:42.618
I couldn't let you die, Peter.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.707
...two... I'm sorry.

35:44.751 --> 35:46.622
...one.

35:46.666 --> 35:48.668
I was gonna wait till
we took off to do this.

35:58.025 --> 36:00.332
Get down!

36:10.820 --> 36:12.866
Chris, down!

36:25.792 --> 36:28.098
This is 20-David.
Call us Code 4.

36:28.142 --> 36:30.013
Send in the paramedics.
Already on it.

36:32.712 --> 36:34.148
I got you, Marshal.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.542
- Thank you.
- You're gonna be okay.

36:36.585 --> 36:38.805
Welcome home, Galloway.

36:38.848 --> 36:41.329
You're under arrest... again.

36:42.852 --> 36:45.159
Hey...

36:45.203 --> 36:47.814
thanks for picking me up.

36:51.426 --> 36:53.341
The situation's
under control, folks.

36:53.385 --> 36:54.516
Who wants to get off this plane?

37:03.438 --> 37:05.092
Thanks for dragging me along
today, Luca.

37:05.135 --> 37:06.354
It didn't take
much convincing.

37:06.398 --> 37:07.486
- See you at work tomorrow?
- Yeah.

37:07.529 --> 37:09.096
See you tomorrow.

37:17.713 --> 37:19.933
You came up big
with the save today.

37:19.976 --> 37:22.544
I'm sorry I lost
my cool earlier.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.981
Tempers were running high,
but for good reason.

37:25.025 --> 37:28.246
We knew if we failed,
we'd never see Street again.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.643
Hey.

37:34.687 --> 37:36.906
Grabbed these from the galley
before I got off.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.734
Told you I'd save you some.

37:39.996 --> 37:42.172
My tiny pretzels.

37:42.216 --> 37:43.739
Thank you.

37:43.783 --> 37:45.437
I mean, you saved us
with your hairpin,

37:45.480 --> 37:47.090
you have excellent
customer service.

37:47.134 --> 37:50.268
- I got to tell your supervisor.
- I didn't save anyone.

37:50.311 --> 37:52.661
You picked the lock,
got out of the cuffs.

37:52.705 --> 37:54.141
Full disclosure:

37:54.184 --> 37:56.883
if you have the right tools,
it's not that hard.

37:56.926 --> 37:58.754
Just don't tell anyone.

38:01.322 --> 38:04.630
Thanks for, uh,
reassuring me up there.

38:04.673 --> 38:07.720
I was a lot more afraid
than I let on.

38:07.763 --> 38:09.635
You helped me get through it.

38:09.678 --> 38:11.289
Yeah.

38:14.379 --> 38:16.337
Look, it seems like
the least I could do

38:16.381 --> 38:18.470
is buy you a bite...

38:18.513 --> 38:20.646
or a drink.

38:21.821 --> 38:24.389
Any way you could
give me a ride home?

38:26.391 --> 38:28.131
Uh, yeah. Sure.

38:28.175 --> 38:29.611
I think I can
figure something out.

38:45.801 --> 38:48.935
Baby.

38:48.978 --> 38:51.329
Oh, there she is.

38:53.461 --> 38:55.855
How's my pretty girl?

38:55.898 --> 38:57.639
Mm.

38:57.683 --> 39:01.077
So, check this out. You know how
we were talking about a getaway?

39:01.121 --> 39:02.688
How about a cruise?

39:02.731 --> 39:05.778
'Cause I damn sure ain't feeling
planes for a while.

39:18.399 --> 39:20.358
You about to give this
back to me?

39:21.707 --> 39:23.796
I was caught up
in the romance this morning,

39:23.839 --> 39:27.408
but maybe this is all a mistake.

39:27.452 --> 39:30.716
A mistake?
What, moving in?

39:30.759 --> 39:32.370
Or us?

39:32.413 --> 39:35.068
Hey...

39:35.111 --> 39:37.592
did something happen today?

39:38.985 --> 39:42.336
Nichelle, talk to me.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.207
Please.

39:44.251 --> 39:48.037
I had a doctor's
appointment last week.

39:48.081 --> 39:51.214
Routine visit, but I asked them
to run some extra tests.

39:51.258 --> 39:54.827
I knew my odds of conceiving
naturally were low,

39:54.870 --> 39:56.481
but I heard today

39:56.524 --> 40:00.136
it looks like they're even lower
than I initially thought.

40:00.180 --> 40:02.400
Oh, I'm so sorry.

40:02.443 --> 40:04.227
Well, we'll just find
another way.

40:04.271 --> 40:07.013
IVF is expensive.

40:07.056 --> 40:08.928
And you know how traumatic

40:08.971 --> 40:10.712
that failed adoption
was for me.

40:10.756 --> 40:12.540
I do.

40:12.584 --> 40:16.414
I don't think there's anything
else to do at this point.

40:19.721 --> 40:23.638
Forgive me, what does this
have to do with moving in?

40:24.900 --> 40:27.120
You just came around
to the idea

40:27.163 --> 40:28.817
of being a father.

40:28.861 --> 40:30.297
I don't want you
to stick around

40:30.340 --> 40:31.820
with someone who
can't make that happen.

40:31.864 --> 40:33.735
- Okay, stop it. Come on, now.
- I understand...

40:33.779 --> 40:35.824
No, no. Hey, hey, come here.

40:38.566 --> 40:40.307
Hell no.

40:40.350 --> 40:42.048
The only reason I thought
being a father

40:42.091 --> 40:43.702
and having kids made
any kind of sense to me

40:43.745 --> 40:46.182
is 'cause I get to
do it with you.

40:46.226 --> 40:49.403
There is no family
without you first.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.884
The rest, it's just...

40:51.927 --> 40:54.060
What, exactly?

40:54.103 --> 40:56.715
A distant second.

41:00.109 --> 41:02.634
You sure?
