00:24.627 --> 00:26.415
Miss Lucy had a steamboat

00:26.481 --> 00:27.966
The steamboat had a bell

00:28.274 --> 00:29.455
Miss Lucy went to

00:29.851 --> 00:31.489
Hello, operator

00:31.708 --> 00:33.345
Get me number nine

00:33.652 --> 00:35.218
And if you disconnect me,

00:35.618 --> 00:36.909
I'll chop off your be....

00:37.546 --> 00:39.268
..hind the 'frigerator

00:39.451 --> 00:41.193
There was a piece of glass

00:41.474 --> 00:43.268
Miss Lucy sat upon it

00:43.491 --> 00:44.909
and it cut her big fat...

00:47.310 --> 00:48.741
Ask me no more questions,

00:48.988 --> 00:50.245
I'll tell you no more...

00:53.786 --> 00:55.144
Spitballs!

01:04.107 --> 01:05.688
I'm using your unfinished novel.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.993
You're in big trouble,
mister.

01:22.047 --> 01:23.481
I'm bleeding.

01:23.482 --> 01:25.688
Hmm, there's no cut
on your cheek.

01:25.756 --> 01:27.172
Where'd the blood
come from?

01:28.844 --> 01:30.353
Hey, I got a loose tooth.

01:33.715 --> 01:35.026
Gross!

01:35.767 --> 01:37.591
I bet you can't twist it.

01:37.637 --> 01:39.378
Of course, I can twist it.

01:39.507 --> 01:40.555
I'm great.

01:45.108 --> 01:47.250
This is my last baby tooth.

01:47.559 --> 01:49.067
That's the money tooth.

01:49.324 --> 01:51.663
I heard the tooth fairy
pays triple for it.

01:51.893 --> 01:53.551
Then let's hurry up
and rip it out of my head.

01:59.545 --> 02:00.173
Skinner!

02:00.371 --> 02:03.356
Your bus driver
just totaled my Camry!

02:03.569 --> 02:05.644
Can I offer you
the use of my Merkur?

02:05.839 --> 02:08.086
Filled with your Burger King
cups and wrappers?

02:08.321 --> 02:09.658
No, thank you.

02:10.901 --> 02:12.242
Lousy drawer.

02:12.449 --> 02:15.604
Potato masher's stuck
in the small spoon slot.

02:15.662 --> 02:17.445
What kind of madman
would do that?

02:24.191 --> 02:26.557
Bart, honey,
I'm so sorry.

02:26.810 --> 02:28.032
No problem.

02:30.708 --> 02:31.893
No harm done.

02:31.913 --> 02:33.052
I wouldn't say that.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.423
God, please give your daughter
the Tooth Fairy

02:39.576 --> 02:41.795
the strength to carry my cash

02:41.924 --> 02:44.656
and the integrity not to
dip her wand in the till.

02:52.366 --> 02:52.930
What the...?

02:53.119 --> 02:56.376
The Tooth Fairy's made a donation
in my name to the United Way?!

02:56.703 --> 02:58.212
That gossamer witch!

02:58.395 --> 03:01.610
Maybe when the Tooth Fairy saw
it was your last baby tooth,

03:01.851 --> 03:04.125
she realized you're not
a little boy anymore.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.348
So she gave you
a grownup gift.

03:06.650 --> 03:07.988
I'm not going to grow up!

03:08.242 --> 03:09.484
Oh, yes, you are.

03:09.741 --> 03:11.011
Why in the right light,

03:11.078 --> 03:12.964
you're starting to get
your own muzzle.

03:13.170 --> 03:14.365
I thought it was
chocolate milk.

03:14.655 --> 03:16.435
Yeah, that's how it starts.

03:16.785 --> 03:18.407
No!

03:19.075 --> 03:20.177
I'm still a kid.

03:20.408 --> 03:21.321
And what do kids love?

03:21.561 --> 03:22.785
Kid stuff like this.

03:33.254 --> 03:34.809
What you realizing, jerk?

03:35.057 --> 03:36.522
That I'm not a kid anymore.

03:36.849 --> 03:37.717
That's harsh.

03:37.986 --> 03:40.266
I knew I was an adult
the day the judge said,

03:40.496 --> 03:42.093
"We're trying you as an adult."

03:42.874 --> 03:45.296
Well, there's one thing
no one can take away--

03:45.475 --> 03:47.274
my childlike imagination.

03:47.490 --> 03:48.562
Sergeant Activity,

03:48.563 --> 03:51.818
your mission is to scale
the icy walls of Mt. Bloodkill.

03:54.672 --> 03:57.701
Must defeat Dr. Blizzard

03:58.248 --> 03:59.753
and the avalanchoids.

04:03.532 --> 04:04.656
Lieutenant Adventure,

04:04.911 --> 04:06.361
what are you doing here?

04:06.434 --> 04:08.747
You're quite the daredevil,
Sergeant Activity.

04:09.064 --> 04:10.997
It's high time
you protected yourself

04:10.998 --> 04:13.201
with supplemental
disability insurance.

04:13.355 --> 04:14.247
At my age?

04:14.488 --> 04:15.912
Can I qualify?

04:16.031 --> 04:17.264
You'd be surprised.

04:17.265 --> 04:18.495
If you're a non-smoker,

04:18.497 --> 04:20.285
it can cost just
a few dollars a month.

04:21.238 --> 04:22.333
What's happening to me?

04:22.620 --> 04:24.749
Maybe I'm not a kid
anymore.

04:26.507 --> 04:27.507
Good-bye Spirogram,

04:27.815 --> 04:29.017
good-bye Sketch-N-Etch,

04:29.224 --> 04:31.550
good-bye Ravenous
Ravenous Rhinos,

04:31.551 --> 04:33.356
Duopoly, Parchoosey,

04:33.546 --> 04:36.207
Humor Putty and
Sock 'Em Knock 'Em Cyborgs.

04:36.377 --> 04:37.913
Good-bye, childhood.

04:38.951 --> 04:41.636
"Dust in the wind"

04:43.296 --> 04:48.365
"All we are is dust
in the wind"

04:50.355 --> 04:51.581
Good-bye,  friends.

05:01.333 --> 05:03.351
"So Eden sank to grief,

05:03.608 --> 05:06.261
"so dawn goes down today.

05:06.988 --> 05:08.839
Nothing gold can stay."

05:10.615 --> 05:11.580
Hey, Sea Captain.

05:11.795 --> 05:14.483
Giving your toys
a Viking funeral, eh?

05:14.752 --> 05:16.608
I really don't want
to talk about it.

05:16.630 --> 05:17.915
If you change your mind,

05:18.203 --> 05:19.671
I won't be far.

05:19.949 --> 05:21.405
Thanks, but...

05:21.416 --> 05:23.074
I've been told
I'm a good listener.

05:23.375 --> 05:24.630
But when you're a captain,

05:24.818 --> 05:27.691
you never know when people
are just flattering you.

05:29.248 --> 05:30.294
He's gone.

05:30.607 --> 05:31.324
Darn it!

05:31.409 --> 05:34.649
I just want a friend
who isn't a work friend.

05:37.364 --> 05:38.782
Bart, if you don't get up now,

05:38.965 --> 05:40.129
good luck getting a pancake.

05:40.288 --> 05:42.583
Dad's pulled his chair
right up to the stove.

05:42.752 --> 05:44.900
Lis, I think I'm having
a mid-life crisis.

05:45.091 --> 05:46.235
If you're
feeling depressed,

05:46.471 --> 05:48.401
do what I do
and write something--

05:48.585 --> 05:50.115
a novel, a play.

05:50.362 --> 05:52.235
Or I could write
something that's not gay.

05:55.514 --> 05:58.765
Bart, someone wrote something
cynical on your shirt.

06:00.113 --> 06:00.923
Let me wash it off.

06:01.166 --> 06:01.994
Leave me alone.

06:02.165 --> 06:03.735
This expresses my rage
at the machine.

06:04.048 --> 06:06.472
Well,  I like T-shirts
with a nice joke.

06:06.690 --> 06:08.249
Like, "Support Our Troops."

06:08.551 --> 06:10.789
Bart's T-Shirt is a classic.

06:11.014 --> 06:12.428
just like "Keep on Truckin'."

06:12.583 --> 06:15.406
As if I would ever want
to stop truckin'.

06:22.454 --> 06:23.809
I wish I had that shirt.

06:23.810 --> 06:25.175
It's clever, funny,

06:25.334 --> 06:27.284
and would cover my
boy boobs nicely.

06:27.814 --> 06:29.882
"I'm too sexy for my shirt"

06:30.171 --> 06:32.013
"Too sexy for my shirt"

06:32.234 --> 06:34.223
"So sexy it hurts"

06:35.334 --> 06:37.769
"I'm too sexy for Milan"

06:38.184 --> 06:39.757
"Too sexy for Milan..."

06:40.259 --> 06:41.884
Bart, I need
that shirt.

06:42.139 --> 06:44.168
I'll trade you
Puppy Goo Goo for it.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.928
She still has a lot of her
original strawberry scent.

06:48.132 --> 06:50.392
Forget it.
My attitude isn't for sale.

06:50.203 --> 06:53.203
What am I saying?
Of course it is.

06:53.584 --> 06:56.317
T-shirts!
Get your sassy T-shirts!

06:56.480 --> 06:59.596
50% cotton, 100% awesome.

06:59.663 --> 07:00.948
Daddy, can I buy this one?

07:01.163 --> 07:03.303
Let's see.
"Get bent."

07:03.503 --> 07:05.353
Well, the only thing
that could mean is

07:05.521 --> 07:06.859
"Kneel down
and pray."

07:07.081 --> 07:08.257
We'll take
the whole box.

07:08.461 --> 07:09.759
Get bent, everyone.

07:09.790 --> 07:12.541
This could get me out of a lot
of sticky situations.

07:12.768 --> 07:13.685
I'll take a dozen.

07:14.981 --> 07:17.731
Do you have a T-shirt
with Calvin peeing on Hobbes?

07:17.732 --> 07:18.110
Sorry.

07:18.708 --> 07:20.577
Well, what do you
got him peeing on?

07:23.731 --> 07:25.015
Well, well, well.

07:25.187 --> 07:26.973
Selling T-shirts
without a permit,

07:27.170 --> 07:30.362
and it looks like one of the
lights in your sneakers is out.

07:31.439 --> 07:32.565
Come on, Chief.

07:32.566 --> 07:35.119
I can't afford to pay
protection to you and Nelson.

07:36.376 --> 07:38.435
Well, then, you're out
of business, boy.

07:38.436 --> 07:39.418
Let's go, boys.

07:39.625 --> 07:40.809
Confiscate his merchandise.

07:42.812 --> 07:44.174
Are any of those my size?

07:45.046 --> 07:46.823
Extra-extra-extra
extra-extra...

07:47.167 --> 07:48.400
...extra-extra large?

07:48.639 --> 07:49.530
Here you go, Chief.

07:50.392 --> 07:52.560
"Proud Nubian Princess."

07:52.845 --> 07:53.702
Score!

07:56.129 --> 07:57.130
It's no fair.

07:57.131 --> 07:58.946
I just started, and
I'm out of business.

07:59.139 --> 08:02.403
Why don't you go legit
and sell your shirts in stores?

08:02.425 --> 08:03.628
But I'm just a kid.

08:04.853 --> 08:06.518
You're a kid
no longer, Bart.

08:06.685 --> 08:07.921
You've become a man.

08:08.110 --> 08:10.047
Hey, you're right. I am.

08:10.614 --> 08:11.855
And as an adult,

08:11.993 --> 08:13.823
you'll be needing
comprehensive insurance.

08:14.850 --> 08:16.034
I'll just leave
these brochures.

08:18.133 --> 08:19.731
So how can I get my
shirts in stores?

08:19.991 --> 08:21.860
I bet you could find
a distributor

08:21.861 --> 08:24.132
at the Springfield Novelty Expo.

08:24.361 --> 08:26.192
That's right.
It's tomorrow.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.351
Oh, my God,
it's a small retailer.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.041
He could make or break us.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.312
Mr. Retailer!
Over here!

08:42.515 --> 08:45.459
Your customers will love
these mood lollipops.

08:45.610 --> 08:47.247
Every lick
reveals your mood.

08:49.155 --> 08:50.420
It works.

08:50.670 --> 08:52.976
If blue is the color
for "unimpressed."

08:53.677 --> 08:56.148
T-shirts. Come order
my homemade T-shirts.

08:56.969 --> 08:58.435
My mom thinks they're good!

08:58.741 --> 08:59.886
Are y'all ready for this?

09:07.056 --> 09:11.238
Krusty Show T-shirts are made
for kids by kids.

09:11.446 --> 09:13.878
And we pass the slavings
on to you.

09:15.581 --> 09:17.302
We've got all
your favorite characters--

09:17.521 --> 09:19.278
Itchy, Scratchy, Poochy,

09:19.320 --> 09:20.548
Austin Powers Itchy,

09:20.558 --> 09:21.441
Itchy Poochy,

09:21.507 --> 09:22.781
Scratchbob Itchpants,

09:22.941 --> 09:23.953
Confederate Itchy,

09:24.103 --> 09:26.484
and Osama Bin Scratchy.

09:30.264 --> 09:31.218
That sucked.

09:31.408 --> 09:33.490
Well, at least
I've still got my health.

09:37.081 --> 09:39.128
Oh,  my golly
graciousness.

09:39.294 --> 09:40.305
Bad car.

09:40.498 --> 09:42.410
Apologize  to the
poor little boy.

09:46.778 --> 09:48.249
This shirt is humorlarious.

09:48.524 --> 09:49.634
Let's see what
else you've got.

09:50.033 --> 09:52.129
Amazing,
trailblazing,

09:52.284 --> 09:53.831
insightful,
delightful,

09:54.048 --> 09:56.416
hysterical,
a miracle!

09:56.586 --> 09:58.170
The kids'll go cuckoo
for these.

10:00.604 --> 10:02.017
My name's
Goose Gladwell.

10:02.175 --> 10:03.736
Of Goose's Gags and Gifts?!

10:03.920 --> 10:04.694
That's right.

10:04.858 --> 10:07.020
I've got 20 stores
in 30 states,

10:07.251 --> 10:10.002
and I want to sell your shirts
in most of them.

10:10.136 --> 10:11.714
You really think
my shirts will sell?

10:11.899 --> 10:14.798
Absotivally.
Here, take my card.

10:18.119 --> 10:19.674
Sorry.  That's my old number.

10:19.860 --> 10:20.756
Let me give you the new one.

10:21.457 --> 10:22.685
Darn. It's out of ink.

10:22.686 --> 10:24.378
But my phone number's
on the pen.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.039
Oh, but it's my old
phone number.

10:27.814 --> 10:28.992
I'll call you.

10:38.730 --> 10:40.954
I've been reading
this magazine for years,

10:41.162 --> 10:44.414
but I never dreamed my
son would be on the cover.

10:47.770 --> 10:48.788
It's Goose!

10:50.732 --> 10:51.713
What the...?

10:51.881 --> 10:53.375
Hello, Simpsons.

10:57.129 --> 10:58.817
You broke in!

10:58.874 --> 11:00.815
We're big fans,
Mr. Gladwell.

11:01.947 --> 11:05.166
Nothing makes parents happier
than when an eccentric single man

11:05.392 --> 11:07.425
takes an interest in their child.

11:08.398 --> 11:11.759
Bart, that's your share
of the T-shirt profits so far.

11:13.861 --> 11:15.223
Look at all
that cash.

11:15.381 --> 11:17.640
And now,
it's time for me...

11:17.793 --> 11:19.642
to leave!

11:25.368 --> 11:27.338
What a delightful sprite!

11:34.627 --> 11:38.548
Smithers, there seems to be some sort
of communiqué on that man's blouse.

11:38.955 --> 11:39.808
I believe it says,

11:39.970 --> 11:41.095
"Don't wake me.
I'm working."

11:41.817 --> 11:42.691
Bolshevism!

11:42.838 --> 11:44.076
Sheer Bolshevism!

11:44.262 --> 11:45.616
Ripe for the quashing.

11:47.432 --> 11:48.928
You're suspended
without pay.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.048
Take your clacking balls
and go.

11:55.185 --> 11:56.015
And on your way out,

11:56.144 --> 11:59.910
remove all the fillings you got
under our dental plan.

12:00.144 --> 12:01.146
You know what, Mr. Burns?

12:01.354 --> 12:03.065
I'm never coming back.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.819
My son's making so much
cash in the T-shirt game,

12:05.961 --> 12:09.086
that I don't have to work
another day in my life.

12:09.309 --> 12:11.504
Assuming my health
does not deteriorate...

12:11.644 --> 12:13.011
as I age.

12:13.169 --> 12:14.678
Good riddance
to bad blubber.

12:14.822 --> 12:16.909
Smithers, want
to go get a cup of coffee?

12:17.055 --> 12:18.249
I just had one, sir.

12:18.383 --> 12:21.697
Why is everyone
so insolent today?

12:21.856 --> 12:23.697
Well, today is Christmas, sir.

12:23.865 --> 12:25.821
I say when it's Christmas.

12:27.223 --> 12:29.688
Too much change around
the house got you down?

12:31.690 --> 12:34.627
Help me, Romco Change Magician!

12:35.989 --> 12:39.373
The Change Magician
will change your life

12:39.543 --> 12:40.749
for the better!

12:43.142 --> 12:44.210
Order today!

12:44.923 --> 12:46.892
Bart, can I ask you
an important question?

12:47.037 --> 12:47.970
How much?

12:48.971 --> 12:49.133
$29.99.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.690
Here's 50.

12:50.845 --> 12:52.885
That's your donut
money, too, Mister.

12:56.795 --> 12:58.859
Lenny, Carl,
how you doing?

12:59.036 --> 13:01.133
Hey, Homer.
How's retirement?

13:01.295 --> 13:02.292
It's awesome.

13:02.293 --> 13:03.449
You know what I've gotten into?

13:03.630 --> 13:05.380
Sleeping till noon.

13:05.557 --> 13:06.974
Yeah. Well, we better get going.

13:07.147 --> 13:09.395
Some of us have to get
up for work tomorrow.

13:09.554 --> 13:11.002
Hey, just 'cause
I'm not working

13:11.003 --> 13:12.987
doesn't mean I can't
gripe like you guys.

13:13.135 --> 13:15.082
Don't you hate it when
people steal your lunch

13:15.083 --> 13:16.545
out of the break room fridge?

13:16.755 --> 13:19.075
Actually, that stopped
after you left, Homer.

13:19.250 --> 13:22.623
Yeah, well, enjoy the
autumn of your years, jerk.

13:23.842 --> 13:25.516
Oh, I see what's going on.

13:25.678 --> 13:27.376
You can't stand
to be around a guy

13:27.377 --> 13:29.621
who's got total
financial independence.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.127
Your bill, sir.

13:33.582 --> 13:34.597
No problem.

13:34.768 --> 13:36.635
Bart, I need $200!

13:36.839 --> 13:38.608
Dad, the bill's only 100.

13:38.784 --> 13:40.915
I broke some
bathroom fixtures.

13:43.235 --> 13:43.809
Pathetic.

13:43.973 --> 13:44.796
I'm pathetic?

13:44.953 --> 13:47.391
Because I take money from
my ten-year-old son?

13:47.550 --> 13:49.673
Well, let me tell
you something.

13:49.841 --> 13:52.457
I still call the
shots around here.

13:52.635 --> 13:54.796
Homer, use your inside voice.

13:54.967 --> 13:57.340
I don't have an inside voice!

13:58.624 --> 14:00.449
The wild Serengeti--

14:00.602 --> 14:03.969
home of Africa's equivalent
to the mountain lion,

14:03.970 --> 14:05.070
the regular lion.

14:05.984 --> 14:10.141
These toothy Tarzan munchers
have a rigid hierarchy

14:10.193 --> 14:12.995
with a single alpha male
ruling the pride...

14:19.124 --> 14:23.679
...until a younger,  more aggressive
lion challenges his power.

14:29.070 --> 14:30.901
The couch
is like that tree.

14:31.086 --> 14:33.657
The displaced male
has two choices:

14:33.879 --> 14:38.636
either spend the rest of his days
among the other broken-down old lions...

14:40.254 --> 14:42.365
All the good graves are taken.

14:42.539 --> 14:44.750
...or find inclusion  in the tribe,

14:45.006 --> 14:47.907
by caring for
vulnerable young cubs.

14:50.903 --> 14:53.963
Lisa, basic cable said
I should nurture you.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.448
Great. Will you play
Malibu Stacy with me?

14:56.668 --> 15:00.276
Okay, you be the girl
and I'll be the car.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.789
I'm going
to the organic market.

15:09.864 --> 15:11.498
Screw the market,
we're going to Mexico!

15:15.896 --> 15:18.159
It's El Flanderino.
Run him down!

15:19.143 --> 15:21.275
I can't run;
I'm wearing flip flops!

15:26.266 --> 15:27.575
what's that dealie?

15:27.631 --> 15:29.813
It's my entry for the
all-school science fair.

15:29.946 --> 15:32.056
It shows the history
of nuclear physics,

15:32.057 --> 15:33.691
from Marie Curie's laboratory

15:33.692 --> 15:36.316
to a scale model of
the first nuclear reactor.

15:36.501 --> 15:37.933
Oh, you'll win
for sure.

15:38.088 --> 15:40.295
You and science go together
like Lenny and Carl.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.241
The science is Carl.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.649
Oh, Lisa!

15:44.770 --> 15:48.794
I'd like to introduce you to the
next winner of the science fair.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.499
Behold! My project.

15:51.579 --> 15:54.720
Childlike Humanoid
Urban Muchacho--

15:54.870 --> 15:56.888
Or... CHUM!

15:56.889 --> 15:59.708
Don't hold my hand.
It's creepy.

15:59.946 --> 16:00.988
Hush, my pet.

16:01.126 --> 16:05.090
Now let us gather our
rosebuds while we may.

16:06.657 --> 16:08.225
A robot?!

16:08.367 --> 16:11.033
Last year the winner
was a jar of owl pellets.

16:11.214 --> 16:14.008
I don't have a chance now.

16:14.219 --> 16:17.093
Honey, all you need's a
little help from your dad.

16:17.294 --> 16:20.293
Remember, I did used to
work at a science factory.

16:20.478 --> 16:23.455
Well, we're supposed to do this
without parental help.

16:23.672 --> 16:25.884
Sweetie, that's orphan talk.

16:28.193 --> 16:29.883
Stupid atomic pile!

16:30.076 --> 16:31.962
How hard could it be
to build a reactor?

16:32.135 --> 16:33.186
Korea did it,

16:33.338 --> 16:35.750
and look at the
quality of their animation.

16:37.244 --> 16:38.913
What to do, what to do.

16:39.835 --> 16:42.507
Maybe the Internet
has the information I need.

16:42.673 --> 16:46.640
It certainly answered a lot of my
questions about wang enhancement.

16:46.846 --> 16:51.081
www.nuclear-secrets.com.

16:51.382 --> 16:53.329
"Are you a terrorist?"

16:53.571 --> 16:54.024
No.

16:54.181 --> 16:57.948
"Would you like to meet someone
special but are tired of the bar scene?"

16:58.135 --> 17:01.382
No. I will never tire
of the bar scene.

17:01.614 --> 17:04.090
Let's see, I can make that.

17:04.537 --> 17:07.277
You can get that
by smashing open a golf ball.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.926
That you can find
in any player piano.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.165
All I need is some plutonium,

17:12.277 --> 17:15.396
and I know just the place
to get it.

17:40.965 --> 17:41.683
Dad?

17:42.684 --> 17:43.410
Don't look.

17:44.187 --> 17:45.994
Dad, what did you do?

17:46.230 --> 17:49.893
Sweetie, your daddy is going to show
you just how much he loves you.

17:50.071 --> 17:53.029
You know that non-functioning
nuclear reactor you built?

17:53.220 --> 17:54.272
Yes?

17:54.454 --> 17:56.339
I juiced it up a little.

17:56.672 --> 17:58.664
Dad, that could explode.

17:58.909 --> 18:00.408
Oh, that's ridiculous.

18:02.548 --> 18:04.073
That thing's gonna blow!

18:04.241 --> 18:05.841
Drop this toy and run!

18:06.194 --> 18:09.908
Mom, Dad built a device that would
be deadly in the wrong hands,

18:10.067 --> 18:11.695
and he's holding it.

18:11.919 --> 18:16.554
Homer, I want you to get that damn
irradiating whatsit out of my home.

18:18.110 --> 18:20.647
I never complain
about your frilly pillows.

18:25.349 --> 18:26.771
How many T-shirts
do you have here?

18:26.937 --> 18:27.842
Just one.

18:28.017 --> 18:31.126
It takes a Marine
honor guard to fold it.

18:31.362 --> 18:33.415
It used to be a dust
cover for a Hummer.

18:33.618 --> 18:35.176
I could go on and on.

18:36.677 --> 18:38.302
Gravies and lentilmen,

18:38.363 --> 18:39.696
I have an exciting announcement.

18:39.903 --> 18:43.222
I have sold the rights to the
Bart Simpson T-shirt line...

18:44.557 --> 18:45.913
to the Disney Company,

18:46.101 --> 18:48.415
which will turn each one
into a movie.

18:48.416 --> 18:50.161
Really?
How much money do I get?

18:50.357 --> 18:51.243
You get nothing.

18:51.394 --> 18:54.446
In fact, thanks to my
team of loopy lawyers...

18:56.514 --> 18:59.163
I never have to give you
another penny.

18:59.350 --> 19:01.929
All you get is a
very valuable lesson.

19:02.110 --> 19:04.244
Never trust a weirdo.

19:07.768 --> 19:09.081
I'm  stuck on a nail!

19:11.010 --> 19:12.303
God, that's painful.

19:13.897 --> 19:15.395
I can't feel my...

19:17.162 --> 19:18.281
What's the matter, boy?

19:18.464 --> 19:19.967
Goose Gladwell ripped me off,

19:19.968 --> 19:21.751
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

19:21.916 --> 19:24.009
I'm just a stupid kid.

19:25.041 --> 19:27.819
Son, when you grew
up, I grew down,

19:28.008 --> 19:30.544
and now I can see you need
your dad more than ever.

19:30.724 --> 19:34.428
And Homer, I can see you
need me more than ever.

19:34.633 --> 19:35.941
Get back in the
garage, old man.

19:36.121 --> 19:38.635
But there's
spiders in the boxes.

19:38.636 --> 19:39.722
Stay out of my boxes!

19:39.793 --> 19:41.557
You give my son
what he deserves,

19:41.735 --> 19:44.470
or I'll knock you on your
delightfully offbeat ass.

19:45.979 --> 19:47.219
I must warn you, sir.

19:47.411 --> 19:49.698
I was a Green Beret in Vietnam.

19:50.865 --> 19:55.995
The things I saw there
are what made me crazy!

19:57.034 --> 19:59.763
Sir, this is a class two
plutonium fission reactor.

19:59.954 --> 20:01.468
If I turn this dial,

20:01.626 --> 20:05.902
the resulting blast would
destroy the entire tri-city area,

20:06.100 --> 20:10.066
including that guy who sells
those Blu-Blocker sunglasses

20:10.241 --> 20:11.885
people sometimes wear.

20:13.620 --> 20:15.272
Damn him to hell.

20:15.495 --> 20:16.660
You can't be serious.

20:16.864 --> 20:19.096
Are you prepared
to take that chance?

20:24.001 --> 20:26.146
Okay, okay, here's
all the money I've got.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.573
Not so fast.
I also want, um...

20:29.357 --> 20:31.738
some dribble glasses,
fake boobs,

20:31.892 --> 20:34.554
two of Bart's T-shirts,
and that rapping toilet seat.

20:34.742 --> 20:37.111
Yo, yo, yo,
keep it on a low flow.

20:38.189 --> 20:39.981
I'm hanging this
over the mantel.

20:40.170 --> 20:41.315
Thanks, Dad.

20:41.506 --> 20:45.928
Well, I'm just glad we're back to me being
the father and you being the son.

20:46.091 --> 20:49.105
Are you sure that thing
could really explode?

20:49.317 --> 20:50.389
Oh, I doubt it.

20:50.536 --> 20:53.526
But we'll let the seagulls
at the dump figure it out.

21:00.275 --> 21:02.570
There's more than one way
to lose a tooth.

21:03.524 --> 21:07.201
Hey, idiot, you're fat, and your
mom is naked on the Internet.

21:07.355 --> 21:08.284
You also smell.

21:11.196 --> 21:14.191
you've given me
a lot to think about.
