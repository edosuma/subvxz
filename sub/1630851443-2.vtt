coming around here.

00:20.827 --> 00:22.103
You know what you put
my family through?

00:22.103 --> 00:23.413
- Don't do it.

00:23.413 --> 00:24.862

your tax returns

00:26.206 --> 00:27.758

what you're giving,

00:29.172 --> 00:30.517
your ass is going to jail.

00:30.517 --> 00:32.172
- So what do you got
planned for the evening?

00:32.172 --> 00:34.000
- I'mma just go home

00:34.000 --> 00:36.172

motherfucker!

00:36.172 --> 00:37.482

00:41.586 --> 00:43.413
- Bitch, shut up!

00:46.172 --> 00:48.241
I said shut the fuck up.

00:51.965 --> 00:55.000
- Wrap him up.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.793
- I--I can't do that.

00:56.793 --> 00:58.310
- Nigga, I just saved
your fuckin' life.

00:58.310 --> 01:00.241
Wrap him up!
- What--

01:00.241 --> 01:03.551
What are you
talking about? I--

01:03.551 --> 01:04.620
- Ask this bitch.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.793
Look at him!
Look at him!

01:06.793 --> 01:08.172
Tell him.

01:10.551 --> 01:15.000
- He--he was gonna kill you.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.827
- And, what, you can't
help me clean up the body?

01:16.827 --> 01:20.206
What the fuck are you
saying to me, Doc, huh?

01:20.206 --> 01:22.448
- I think I'm gonna throw up.
- How are you gonna throw up?

01:22.448 --> 01:25.103
Nigga, I'm the
one that shot him!

01:25.103 --> 01:26.620
Get the fuck out.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.310
Get the fuck out and
leave the ladies to do

01:28.310 --> 01:30.241
what the fuck
y'all men can't do!

01:30.241 --> 01:31.827
Cleaning up y'all's shit.

01:34.206 --> 01:37.034
- I got it.

01:37.034 --> 01:39.206
- Get him to my office.

01:39.206 --> 01:42.310
-Okay.
- And make this bitch help.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.034
-Mm-hmm.
- Please. Please.

01:44.034 --> 01:45.448
- And talk to her--
- Please.

01:45.448 --> 01:48.000
- 'Cuz if I have to--
bitch, shut the fuck up.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.275
If I have to come back here,

01:49.275 --> 01:50.689
I swear I'm gonna
kill everything breathing

01:50.689 --> 01:52.724
in this motherfucker,
and that would be you.

01:55.275 --> 01:58.137
- Yes, Madam.
- Fuck, I need a massage.

01:58.137 --> 02:01.172
- Get the fuck up.

02:01.172 --> 02:03.137
Get the fuck up.

02:05.172 --> 02:06.586
- All right.

02:08.310 --> 02:10.206
You got a mop, bitch?

02:10.206 --> 02:12.241
If you don't stop
this fucking crying...

02:15.551 --> 02:18.379
Bitch, I asked you if
you had a fucking mop.

02:18.379 --> 02:20.310
If you throw up here
on this nigga--

02:20.310 --> 02:23.827
get a fucking mop!

02:23.827 --> 02:26.137
Now!

02:31.172 --> 02:33.310
She ain't never
like you, nigga.

02:33.310 --> 02:37.206
Huh? You hear me?

02:37.206 --> 02:39.379
Did you get a fucking mop?

02:39.379 --> 02:41.241
If I gotta come into
that motherfucking bathroom,

02:41.241 --> 02:42.758
I'mma choke your ass out.

02:43.965 --> 02:46.413
- Shut the fuck up!

02:46.413 --> 02:48.310
You got any money,
bitch?

02:53.379 --> 02:54.896
You stay there.

03:08.758 --> 03:10.103
- Mm.

03:33.551 --> 03:36.551
Madam?

03:36.551 --> 03:39.862
-Midnight,
get to the club now.

03:51.103 --> 03:52.310
- Yeah.

03:59.586 --> 04:01.413
-Midnight,
bury him deep.

04:01.413 --> 04:04.758
I don't want him to smell.

04:04.758 --> 04:07.413
In the springtime,
I'll lay some concrete.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.586
Put a patio on top of him.

04:10.586 --> 04:12.827
- I'm taking the car up
to Virgil at the junkyard.

04:14.103 --> 04:15.965
- That should cover it.

04:15.965 --> 04:18.655
And dispose of the cellphone
along the way, but leave it on,

04:18.655 --> 04:21.103
so one of the cell towers
can pick it up.

04:21.103 --> 04:23.206
- Say less.

05:05.827 --> 05:08.034
- Yeah, I'm good.

05:13.344 --> 05:16.448
- Yo! What's good?

05:16.448 --> 05:17.931
- Hey.

05:17.931 --> 05:21.068
- I'm Red.

05:21.068 --> 05:23.000
- I'm Amp.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.448
- How's your first
night in paradise?

05:26.448 --> 05:28.586
- It was all right.

05:28.586 --> 05:31.241
- How many days you got?

05:31.241 --> 05:32.724
- Sixty.

05:32.724 --> 05:36.275
- Aw, shit, that's easy.
I got about 20 more.

05:36.275 --> 05:37.896
- All right.
Good for you, man.

05:39.931 --> 05:41.344
- Got a job yet?

05:43.310 --> 05:46.137
- No. I'mma, uh,
start looking today.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.379
- Don't worry about it.

05:47.379 --> 05:48.896
You ain't find
shit around here.

05:48.896 --> 05:51.034
Took me forever.

05:51.034 --> 05:54.068
- Well, maybe my luck is better,
all right?

05:54.068 --> 05:56.689
- Don't count on it.

05:56.689 --> 06:01.448
My nigga, I'm washing
dishes for $5 an hour.

06:01.448 --> 06:05.103
- Dog, but that
ain't minimum wage.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.275
- I had to get whatever
I could take under the table.

06:07.275 --> 06:09.517
Matter of fact, I could put
a word in for you, if you want.

06:09.517 --> 06:12.827
- No. I'm--I'm cool, man.

06:12.827 --> 06:15.758
I know that shit's kind
of illegal, so I'm good.

06:15.758 --> 06:17.241
- Nigga, that's on the boss.

06:17.241 --> 06:22.620
When I was rollin', I was
making fucking thousands.

06:22.620 --> 06:24.793
- Nigga, what was you doing?

06:24.793 --> 06:26.172
- Nigga, we don't talk
about this shit around here.

06:26.172 --> 06:29.620
-Oh. My bad, brother.
I feel you.

06:29.620 --> 06:32.689
- But if I had a legal option.

06:32.689 --> 06:36.448
- Yeah. I get you, man.

06:36.448 --> 06:37.827
Mad shit.

06:37.827 --> 06:39.034
- Hey.
-Yeah?

06:39.034 --> 06:42.862
- You got any options?
- No, man.

06:46.620 --> 06:48.448
- So what's your plan?

06:49.724 --> 06:51.448
- I'm gonna go online,
then try to find a job.

06:51.448 --> 06:55.344
- As a felon?

06:55.344 --> 06:56.931
Ain't nobody tell you, man?

06:56.931 --> 06:58.965
Yeah, that shit
ain't gonna work.

06:58.965 --> 07:00.413
You're gonna burn up
all your damn minutes

07:00.413 --> 07:03.655
trying to find a damn job.

07:03.655 --> 07:07.965
- I think I'm good.
- A'ight.

07:07.965 --> 07:10.103
By the way, I saw
your phone last night.

07:13.689 --> 07:16.000
- What you doing
lookin' at my phone?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.965
- Naw, it's just nice.
It's, like, new.

07:17.965 --> 07:19.655
How you get that
coming out of jail?

07:19.655 --> 07:21.275
- None of your business, man.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.862
- A'ight.

07:25.034 --> 07:26.758
I see you gotta be
all hard and shit.

07:26.758 --> 07:28.517
Like, chill, I've
been locked up too.

07:28.517 --> 07:29.896
-We all have, bro.

07:29.896 --> 07:31.827
- That's why we're here, nigga.
I get it.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.655
But you ain't gotta
be that way with me.

07:33.655 --> 07:36.482
You'll see, I'm cool.

07:36.482 --> 07:37.965
- All right, bro.

07:37.965 --> 07:39.965
- I got your back.
I'm your roommate.

07:39.965 --> 07:44.620
- All right.
- Have you met Bill yet?

07:44.620 --> 07:45.896
- No. Who's Bill?

07:45.896 --> 07:49.482
Oh, you'll see.

07:49.482 --> 07:50.758
But you met Paul, right?

07:50.758 --> 07:53.206
- Uh, yeah, last night.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.758
- Yeah, total opposite.

07:54.758 --> 07:56.758
-Amp!
Paul's looking for you!

07:56.758 --> 08:01.275
- Shit, speaking of
Paul, that's you.

08:01.275 --> 08:02.655
- I guess I'm new news, huh?

08:02.655 --> 08:04.896
- Yeah, and they wanna see you.

08:04.896 --> 08:07.620
- All right. Thanks, man.
- I got you.

08:07.620 --> 08:08.724
-Yeah.

08:08.724 --> 08:12.551
- Loosen up! Goddamn!

08:21.137 --> 08:23.620
- Mr. Harold, you
wanted to see me?

08:23.620 --> 08:25.793
- Yeah, have a seat.

08:27.896 --> 08:31.344
They was supposed to
get you a parole officer,

08:31.344 --> 08:34.793
but apparently the
office is backed up.

08:34.793 --> 08:38.310
So I'll be handling
your case until they do.

08:38.310 --> 08:41.793
Same rules apply,
including random drug testing.

08:41.793 --> 08:44.827
- Hey, am I testing today?

08:44.827 --> 08:47.310
- It's called
random for a reason.

08:47.310 --> 08:49.137
- Right.

08:49.137 --> 08:52.689
-Listen, don't think for
one minute that I'm gonna go

08:52.689 --> 08:54.827
easy on you because we
live under the same roof

08:54.827 --> 08:57.137
and got the same skin color.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.793
I don't mind sending
any of you motherfuckers

08:58.793 --> 09:02.068
back to prison at all.

09:02.068 --> 09:06.034
One fuck-up,
you can get the fuck out.

09:06.034 --> 09:09.517
- Is that it?
- For now.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.517
- How did it go last night?

09:31.517 --> 09:33.965
- We got him buried.
- Good.

09:33.965 --> 09:37.275
- So, are we going
to talk about Doc?

09:40.620 --> 09:42.689
- What is there to talk about?

09:42.689 --> 09:45.620
- Him not being
able to help, Madam.

09:45.620 --> 09:48.551
- Blue...

09:48.551 --> 09:53.206
it is what it is. Okay?

09:53.206 --> 09:56.620
- Madam, you saved
that nigga's life.

09:56.620 --> 09:58.965
- No, I didn't.

09:58.965 --> 10:00.862
- I was there, remember?

10:03.206 --> 10:08.206
- What I did was bought
another ally, okay?

10:08.206 --> 10:11.413
Allen's been putting pressure
on me to sell my club to Gene,

10:11.413 --> 10:13.896
and that shit is not happening.

10:13.896 --> 10:16.862
So, I killed two birds

10:16.862 --> 10:20.379
with one stone...literally.

10:20.379 --> 10:26.068
Got Allen's ass out the
way and Doc in my debts.

10:26.068 --> 10:30.034
Now let me run this play, okay?

10:30.034 --> 10:32.551
-Okay.
- I got this.

10:32.551 --> 10:34.655
- You always stay two
steps ahead of them niggas.

10:34.655 --> 10:36.724
You already know.

10:36.724 --> 10:38.137
-I like your style.

10:38.137 --> 10:41.724
- Yes, speaking of
steps, step over there.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.275
I have a surprise for you.

10:43.275 --> 10:46.793
Oh yeah? And what's that?

10:46.793 --> 10:48.206
- Not much.

10:48.206 --> 10:52.172
Just a little something
to say thank you.

10:52.172 --> 10:53.482
- Where he at?

10:55.724 --> 10:57.517
- Come on.

11:02.034 --> 11:03.620
- Now, don't be shy.
- I ain't shy.

11:03.620 --> 11:05.241
-Hurry your ass up.

11:12.137 --> 11:14.931
- I got it.
- He ain't got it.

11:14.931 --> 11:16.310
- Come on, bro.
You gotta get

11:16.310 --> 11:18.931
your damn weight up.
- I got my weight up.

11:18.931 --> 11:20.103
- Yeah, if you did,
you wouldn't be

11:20.103 --> 11:23.103
trying to pay child support.

11:23.103 --> 11:25.241
- Hey, man, go
ahead on with that shit.

11:25.241 --> 11:27.655
- I'm telling you,
man, you better.

11:27.655 --> 11:31.379
- Hey, do you got a baby
and a crazy-ass baby momma?

11:31.379 --> 11:33.689
The fuck you gonna
tell me what I need to do?

11:33.689 --> 11:35.275
- I don't need to
have all that to know.

11:35.275 --> 11:37.896
- Man, cut out the
fake-ass accent.

11:37.896 --> 11:40.758
Hell, we all know
you ain't Latin.

11:40.758 --> 11:42.172
- You don't know shit.

11:42.172 --> 11:45.655
- Yo, but look, seriously,
I got a problem.

11:48.034 --> 11:50.620
- What is it, bro?
- So that VIP chick

11:50.620 --> 11:52.896
that kept me up there
for an hour last night?

11:52.896 --> 11:54.103
- What the hell
was that all about?

11:54.103 --> 11:57.310
- Yo, tell me why
that was the judge?

11:57.310 --> 12:00.586
- Yo! I thought
I recognized her!

12:00.586 --> 12:04.344
- She wore my ass out last
night, and Patty was there.

12:04.344 --> 12:06.862
- Bro, I told you,
be careful with that shit.

12:06.862 --> 12:08.206
- I know, man.

12:08.206 --> 12:09.448
- She takin' care
of you, though?

12:09.448 --> 12:11.620
- She is.

12:11.620 --> 12:14.206
- Yo, she not taking care of me.

12:14.206 --> 12:15.931
Just pays for a few things.

12:15.931 --> 12:17.620
- All his needs.

12:17.620 --> 12:19.344
- Bro, I had one
of those before.

12:19.344 --> 12:20.896
And when I left her
and went on to another,

12:20.896 --> 12:22.827
she fucked all my shit up.

12:22.827 --> 12:25.000
- What?
- Bro, all my credit.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.344
Even got my car repossessed

12:26.344 --> 12:28.172
'cuz it was
in both our fucking names.

12:28.172 --> 12:30.827
- He's not that dumb.
The car's in your name, right?

12:33.793 --> 12:37.344
- Oh, fuck, damn.
- Damn!

12:37.344 --> 12:39.689
I hope the apartment
is in your name.

12:39.689 --> 12:42.310
- Where the hell is Doc?

12:42.310 --> 12:45.000
- Bro, you better hope to hell
Ms. Patty don't find out.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.551
- Yo, where is Doc?

12:46.551 --> 12:50.206
- She gonna find out.
- She's gonna find out, bro.

12:50.206 --> 12:51.206
- Bullshit.

12:51.206 --> 12:53.241
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, Toni.

12:53.241 --> 12:55.482
- Hey, what's up?
- How y'all fellas doing?

12:55.482 --> 12:57.344
- I'm doing all right.
How you doing?

12:57.344 --> 13:02.206
- You know, just trying to keep
it tight while running this gym.

13:02.206 --> 13:04.137
- Yeah, damn sure looking tight.

13:04.137 --> 13:06.586
- Looks like you ain't
missed a day in the gym.

13:06.586 --> 13:09.586
- Thank you. Fuego,
can you come take a look

13:09.586 --> 13:12.103
at the computer I DJ with
in the spin room?

13:12.103 --> 13:14.241
I'm having trouble
logging in to my music.

13:14.241 --> 13:15.827
- Yeah, you know he got you.

13:15.827 --> 13:17.241
He can do all
that computer shit.

13:17.241 --> 13:20.000
- Yeah, yeah.

- Mm.

13:41.724 --> 13:43.965
Ooh.

13:43.965 --> 13:45.931
I can't remember the last
time I had one of these.

13:45.931 --> 13:47.827
- Mm-hmm.

13:53.275 --> 13:55.758
- Damn, thank you, Madam.
Fuck.

13:55.758 --> 13:58.827
- No, thank you, Blue.

13:58.827 --> 14:00.551
Thank you for always
having my back.

14:05.172 --> 14:10.896
I can't count on many people.
But you? You a real one.

14:10.896 --> 14:12.482
- You being
sentimental on me, Madam?

14:12.482 --> 14:15.655
- No.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.448
I just appreciate you, Blue.

14:21.379 --> 14:24.689
All right, now it's
time for our mani and pedis.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.689
- See, this is what
I'm talking about, right?

14:26.689 --> 14:29.517
This is how you
thank a motherfucker.

14:38.724 --> 14:40.206
- No.

14:40.206 --> 14:43.517
That is how you
thank a motherfucker.

14:48.275 --> 14:50.413
- See it?
- Yeah.

14:50.413 --> 14:52.448
All you have
to do is this.

14:52.448 --> 14:56.241
That, update,
refresh this, and...

14:56.241 --> 14:58.793
- Let me see.
Let me see. Let me see.

14:58.793 --> 15:04.482
So you were saying
refresh this, update that.

15:04.482 --> 15:07.965
Oh. Thank you.

15:07.965 --> 15:11.137
- But I think you knew that.

15:11.137 --> 15:13.275
- What makes you think that?

15:13.275 --> 15:16.758
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

15:16.758 --> 15:18.586
I haven't seen you in a while.

15:18.586 --> 15:23.000
- I'm good.
I gotta get back out there.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.758
- I saw you guys dancing online.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.758
- Online? We're not
supposed to be online.

15:28.758 --> 15:31.206
- I saw it.

15:31.206 --> 15:33.896
- I should look that
up and talk to Madam.

15:33.896 --> 15:38.586
- I wish I could see it
live, but uh, you know...

15:38.586 --> 15:39.965
- What?

15:39.965 --> 15:41.344
- I got the real
thing in front of me,

15:41.344 --> 15:43.965
so why do I need
to go to a club?

15:43.965 --> 15:45.827
I really wanna see you.

15:45.827 --> 15:48.379
- See--
- What?

15:48.379 --> 15:51.206
- Look.
- I got money if that's it.

15:51.206 --> 15:54.172
- Ain't about the money.
That really ain't my thing.

15:54.172 --> 15:58.068
- That ain't really?
Or it ain't?

15:58.068 --> 16:01.448
- Look, I'm a sexual man.

16:01.448 --> 16:04.241
- Didn't I give you the best
blowjob you've ever had?

16:04.241 --> 16:06.068
That's what you said.

16:06.068 --> 16:08.862
- I was--
- You was what?

16:08.862 --> 16:10.655
- Come on.
- You come on!

16:13.137 --> 16:15.000

-Mm-hmm?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.379
Fuck.

16:26.379 --> 16:27.620
Toni.

16:43.241 --> 16:45.827
- Hey! Hey!

16:48.448 --> 16:51.586
- Hey, break it up!
Break it up!

16:51.586 --> 16:54.586
Leave her alone!
Leave her alone!

16:57.551 --> 16:59.413
- Are you okay?

16:59.413 --> 17:01.310
- I didn't do nothing to them.

17:01.310 --> 17:02.827
-Then why
are they fighting you?

17:02.827 --> 17:06.689
- They always make fun of me.
- Here.

17:06.689 --> 17:08.206
Dry your eyes off.

17:13.344 --> 17:15.758
- Madam? You all right?

17:15.758 --> 17:18.448
- I'm good. Get my table.

17:18.448 --> 17:19.827
- Okay.

17:21.689 --> 17:24.172
- I got blood on your scarf.
I'm sorry.

17:24.172 --> 17:27.068
- It's okay.
It's a handkerchief.

17:27.068 --> 17:29.896
I have plenty of them.
You can keep it.

17:29.896 --> 17:31.965
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:31.965 --> 17:35.206
Why are they making fun of you?
- Look at me.

17:37.758 --> 17:42.068
- What? I'm looking.
What are you talking about?

17:42.068 --> 17:44.965
- Don't act like
you don't see it.

17:44.965 --> 17:47.379
I'm fat, and my clothes are--

17:52.620 --> 17:55.275
- Do you have a phone?
-No.

17:55.275 --> 17:59.000
- I didn't think so.
Take this.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.689
- I can have it?
- Yeah.

18:00.689 --> 18:02.689
Look, my number
is in there, okay?

18:02.689 --> 18:05.586
Now, if they come back and
they fuck with you again,

18:05.586 --> 18:09.241
you let me know.
You call me, okay?

18:09.241 --> 18:10.655
- For real?

18:12.551 --> 18:15.655
- Yeah.

18:15.655 --> 18:17.827
Let me see that.
I'm gonna call somebody.

18:22.206 --> 18:24.034
- Oh, what
the fuck does she want?

18:24.034 --> 18:26.448
Answer!

18:26.448 --> 18:28.551
- Miss Madam!
Yeah, I'm looking at

18:28.551 --> 18:32.758
r-r-racks and r-r-racks
of things for you, honey.

18:32.758 --> 18:34.965
- Bring 'em to the club.
-You got it!

18:34.965 --> 18:37.000
- Look, Gabriel, I'm gonna
send somebody to you.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.827
- What, we got a
fine new dancer?

18:38.827 --> 18:43.689
-No.
It's a new friend of mine.

18:43.689 --> 18:44.827
What's your name?

18:44.827 --> 18:47.103
- Shemika.

18:47.103 --> 18:49.137
- It's Shemika, okay?

18:49.137 --> 18:52.034
Get her dressed very nice for
school and send me the bill.

18:52.034 --> 18:54.655
Just tell me how much it is.

18:54.655 --> 18:57.551
- No, ma'am.
-Excuse me?

18:57.551 --> 19:00.793
- I am tired of you and
your little charity cases.

19:00.793 --> 19:03.896
I dress divas, not these
little underprivileged girls

19:03.896 --> 19:06.827
you send up in here.

19:06.827 --> 19:10.310
- Shemika, this
is Gabriel, okay?

19:10.310 --> 19:12.068
What I'm gonna need
you to do is go see him.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.344
And he's going to be nice.

19:13.344 --> 19:15.758
And if he's not,
then you let me know,

19:15.758 --> 19:18.793
'cuz you have my number, okay?

19:18.793 --> 19:22.310
- Madam, I'm on the phone.
- I know you on the phone,

19:22.310 --> 19:23.965
and I know you can hear me,
bitch, listen.

19:23.965 --> 19:25.586
If you are rude
to this little girl,

19:25.586 --> 19:28.068
I will fuck you up,
you hear me?

19:28.068 --> 19:30.482
-Madam, I gotta
say this one thing to you.

19:30.482 --> 19:36.448
You are a strange bi--
colorful character.

19:36.448 --> 19:38.103
I've seen you bash
a ho's head in,

19:38.103 --> 19:42.034
but you--you stop the car to
help a kitten and these kids.

19:42.034 --> 19:46.620
- Yeah, well, someone has to.
Yo' ass ain't.

19:46.620 --> 19:50.275
Here, baby, take this.
- Thank you.

19:50.275 --> 19:51.724
- Call me if you need me.

19:55.172 --> 19:56.793
Hold your head up, baby.

20:14.103 --> 20:15.586
- Uh, sorry.

20:17.344 --> 20:19.965
- Is she okay?

20:19.965 --> 20:23.689
- Yeah. She's okay.

20:24.862 --> 20:26.896
- You always helping.

20:26.896 --> 20:32.413
- Well, Dime, there's
always someone in need.

20:32.413 --> 20:35.344
Speaking of, I wanted
to say thank you.

20:35.344 --> 20:37.620
- For?

20:37.620 --> 20:39.620
- For dropping off my
nephew the other day.

20:41.931 --> 20:43.275
- Sure.

20:45.965 --> 20:48.275
- I saw the way you
were looking at him.

20:48.275 --> 20:51.586
- What?

20:51.586 --> 20:53.827
- Girl, please, you
know I know women, okay?

20:55.620 --> 21:01.620
And it's been--it's
been a while for you, Dime.

21:01.620 --> 21:05.448
- Yeah, I am just
trying to work.

21:05.448 --> 21:09.034
- What's going on?
For real, what's going on?

21:09.034 --> 21:10.827
- Can we just focus on the club?

21:14.896 --> 21:18.896
- Okay.
My club is on autopilot.

21:18.896 --> 21:22.137
Baby girl, I'm about
to open up another one.

21:22.137 --> 21:24.034
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:24.034 --> 21:29.482
And I am considering
letting you run it.

21:29.482 --> 21:33.689
I mean, you have
been kicking ass for me.

21:33.689 --> 21:36.827
- Thank you, Madam.
- Oh, you gettin' deep.

21:36.827 --> 21:38.896
- No, I need this--
- I had a long night.

21:38.896 --> 21:42.344
I want happy thoughts.
Okay? Happy thoughts.

21:42.344 --> 21:43.931
Let's drink.

21:43.931 --> 21:47.586
- Yeah, you the one

21:47.586 --> 21:49.551
- Okay, forget I

21:49.551 --> 21:51.827
-Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

21:53.586 --> 21:56.344
- Silly girl.
- Fine.

21:59.172 --> 22:01.689
- That's her.
- Yeah?

22:01.689 --> 22:05.137
- Damn.
- You gonna go talk to her?

22:05.137 --> 22:07.068
- Look like she's busy.

22:07.068 --> 22:09.827
- You've been coming here twice
a week with money you don't have

22:09.827 --> 22:11.344
just 'cuz you heard
she comes here.

22:11.344 --> 22:13.137
Go talk to her.

22:13.137 --> 22:14.724
- No.

22:14.724 --> 22:18.000
- I'm not gonna let
you pass this by.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.275
- You see what them
guys look like in there?

22:20.275 --> 22:22.379
- Look at you! You can do it.

22:22.379 --> 22:24.586
I'm good on that.

22:24.586 --> 22:25.896
- I'm sick of this shit.

22:25.896 --> 22:28.000
You wanna work at Club Eden?
Go on!

22:28.000 --> 22:30.482
All the money they make?
You're just as hot.

22:30.482 --> 22:33.655
- You say that now, but you get
jealous every time I be dancing.

22:33.655 --> 22:35.758
- That was before all
this damn rent was due.

22:35.758 --> 22:37.965
- Shit.
- Go talk to her.

22:37.965 --> 22:40.241
- Okay.

23:03.724 --> 23:06.103
- Hi, Jay.

23:06.103 --> 23:08.689

23:08.689 --> 23:11.000
- Is there something you

23:11.000 --> 23:13.137
- Uh...

23:13.137 --> 23:15.241
- Baby, spit it out, come on.
Time is money.

23:15.241 --> 23:17.000
- I want to dance at your club.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.724
No, thank you.

23:19.724 --> 23:21.241
I have enough dancers.

23:21.241 --> 23:22.862
- But I'm good, though.

23:22.862 --> 23:24.620
- No.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.896
-Okay.

23:26.896 --> 23:29.620
- Damn, Jay!
Do you give up that easy?

23:29.620 --> 23:34.103
- No, I'm sorry. Uh...

23:34.103 --> 23:35.482
- Are you any good?

23:35.482 --> 23:36.965
-Yeah, I'm really good--

23:36.965 --> 23:39.517
- Turn around. Let me see.
Let me see your ass.

23:41.344 --> 23:44.620
- Turn around!
Come on. Stop.

23:44.620 --> 23:46.551
Raise your shirt up.
I can't see shit.

23:49.379 --> 23:51.551
What you think, Dime?

23:51.551 --> 23:52.793
- I don't know.

23:52.793 --> 23:55.620
It's, uh--he seems a little...

23:55.620 --> 23:57.689
- He's, like, passive?
- Yes.

23:57.689 --> 23:59.586
-That's kind of passive.
- Yeah.

23:59.586 --> 24:01.620
- I can be aggressive.

24:01.620 --> 24:03.620
- Ooh, clutching my pearls!
He scared me.

24:03.620 --> 24:05.862
- Terrified. Oh my gosh.

24:05.862 --> 24:07.862
Baby, if you want
to work at Eden,

24:07.862 --> 24:09.689
you gonna have
to get aggressive.

24:09.689 --> 24:13.241
Our women love aggressive.

24:13.241 --> 24:15.413
- Oh--okay.

24:15.413 --> 24:20.862
- Look...I have
an amateur night.

24:20.862 --> 24:25.379
Give her your number
and someone will call you.

24:25.379 --> 24:27.275
- Thank you.

24:27.275 --> 24:30.137
Thank you.

24:30.137 --> 24:33.586
- Who is that?
- That's my girlfriend.

24:35.931 --> 24:38.689
- You date white girls?
- Yeah.

24:38.689 --> 24:41.241
- Don't bring that
bitch to my club, okay?

24:41.241 --> 24:44.206
I deal in Black excellence only.

24:44.206 --> 24:45.586
-Please don't.

24:45.586 --> 24:48.620
- I won't.

24:48.620 --> 24:51.413
- She jealous.
-Yeah, she is.

24:51.413 --> 24:55.068
- No, I know she's jealous.
That wasn't a question.

24:55.068 --> 24:59.517
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

24:59.517 --> 25:01.586
You guys won't
be together long.

25:01.586 --> 25:03.000
- Not working at Eden.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.172
-Mm-mm, nope.
- Sorry, boo-boo.

25:05.172 --> 25:07.620
- I do have a question for you.
-Okay.

25:07.620 --> 25:09.931
- You're giving me
real little dick energy.

25:09.931 --> 25:13.379
How big is your dick?

25:13.379 --> 25:14.724
- Uh...

25:14.724 --> 25:16.793
- He ain't ready.
- Nope.

25:16.793 --> 25:18.310
If the inches are less than

25:18.310 --> 25:21.482
the number of digits
in your phone number,

25:21.482 --> 25:25.172
don't come.

25:25.172 --> 25:27.448
- You--you talkin' about
with area code too,

25:27.448 --> 25:30.275
or just the actual number?

25:30.275 --> 25:32.827
- Wait, did he just
say he was 10 inches?

25:32.827 --> 25:35.241
- Uh, if he don't
wanna--the area code,

25:35.241 --> 25:37.655
it must be less than 6.

25:37.655 --> 25:39.413
- You 6, 10,
somewhere in between?

25:39.413 --> 25:43.413
- No, I got 10, yup. Yeah!

25:43.413 --> 25:45.620
Mm-hmm. I'm--yup.

25:45.620 --> 25:48.068
Yes, I am. Yup.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.965
- I don't get that
energy, but it's fine.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.758
We shall see.
-Okay.

25:51.758 --> 25:53.275
- Thank you, Jay.

25:53.275 --> 25:55.000
- Thank you! Thank you!

25:55.000 --> 25:56.793
-Bye.
- Uh, all right, bye.

25:56.793 --> 25:59.000
- You're still here, Jay.

26:00.965 --> 26:02.620
-Goodbye, Jay.

26:02.620 --> 26:04.413
- Thank you.

26:06.517 --> 26:08.931
- Those niggas is crazy.
- Girl.

26:17.172 --> 26:20.517
- Hello, hi.
Um, my name is Anthony.

26:20.517 --> 26:24.172
I put in an application online.

26:24.172 --> 26:25.689
Uh-huh.

26:25.689 --> 26:28.103
Oh, it got rejected?

26:30.758 --> 26:34.103
Yeah. Quick question.

26:34.103 --> 26:36.172
How do you guys make
your decisions so fast?

26:40.586 --> 26:43.517
Oh, okay. Uh, yeah.

26:43.517 --> 26:45.620
That's fine, I understand.

26:45.620 --> 26:48.275
Yeah, thanks. Yeah.

26:52.965 --> 26:58.068
- Yo, I'm telling
you, I did all of that.

26:58.068 --> 27:01.241
I applied to all
those jobs online.

27:01.241 --> 27:04.551
Every time you click "felon,"
the computer kicks you.

27:04.551 --> 27:07.137
They never see it.

27:07.137 --> 27:10.034
- Yeah, I see.
That was the ninth one.

27:10.034 --> 27:14.379
- You don't get it. Look.

27:14.379 --> 27:16.862
You gotta know somebody
or it ain't gonna work.

27:21.586 --> 27:23.896
- I kind of do, but I'm cool.

27:23.896 --> 27:25.896
- Who? Can you put me on?

27:25.896 --> 27:28.172
-No, man.
- Who do you know?

27:31.344 --> 27:33.379
- My aunt.

27:33.379 --> 27:35.793
She--she owns a club.

27:35.793 --> 27:37.310
- What club?

27:40.724 --> 27:42.206
- Eden.

27:44.310 --> 27:46.965
- You kidding me, right?
- No, man. She owns Eden.

27:46.965 --> 27:49.034
- Nigga, why the hell
you ain't working there?

27:49.034 --> 27:51.724
- Yo, I just don't
wanna be around--

27:51.724 --> 27:53.344
- No, you gotta call your aunt.

27:53.344 --> 27:55.482
Hell, tell her I'm available.
I'll strip,

27:55.482 --> 27:57.517
park cars.
- Chill. Hey, calm down, man.

27:57.517 --> 28:01.896
Um, no, I don't think
you'd fit the bill, all right?

28:01.896 --> 28:04.517
- What the hell
you trying to say?

28:04.517 --> 28:06.620
-Nothing, dog.

28:06.620 --> 28:09.862
She did ask me to work the
door, but, you know, I'm cool.

28:09.862 --> 28:12.068
You feel me?
- Then call her!

28:12.068 --> 28:15.068
- No, nigga.
I just told you no.

28:15.068 --> 28:18.551
- Oh, probably too
much temptation.

28:18.551 --> 28:22.241
Is that the reason you here?

28:22.241 --> 28:25.068
I get it. Do you.

28:25.068 --> 28:27.517
- Nigga, weren't
you going somewhere?

28:27.517 --> 28:31.517
- I was just coming
here to say hi to you, man.

28:31.517 --> 28:34.275
- You're good.

28:34.275 --> 28:37.793
- One day, you gonna
realize I'm on your side.

28:41.206 --> 28:42.862
-Yo, okay.

28:50.551 --> 28:53.586
- In the meantime, I'm gonna
go work on my moves for Eden.

29:09.689 --> 29:12.275
- Ah, Miss Madam.
- Hi.

29:12.275 --> 29:15.241
- No, no, no.
Now, don't you "hi" me.

29:15.241 --> 29:17.068
- Mrow.

29:17.068 --> 29:19.655
- You didn't tell me you
were sending two girls to me.

29:19.655 --> 29:21.379
- I sent one girl to you.

29:21.379 --> 29:24.896
- No, bitch, it took two of
everything to fit that fat ho.

29:24.896 --> 29:26.310
- Are these my clothes?

29:26.310 --> 29:28.448
- I mean, what do
you think this is?

29:28.448 --> 29:29.758
- Move, let me see.

29:33.310 --> 29:37.586
- She's cute.
I'll take 'em all.

29:37.586 --> 29:38.965
- Perfect, dahling.

29:38.965 --> 29:42.689
- No, this is
perfect...for tonight.

29:42.689 --> 29:44.275
- Alrighty.

29:44.275 --> 29:46.034
But you still owe
me for that girl.

29:46.034 --> 29:50.068
- Okay.
How much do you want?

29:50.068 --> 29:53.827
- Never mind.
I had some, uh, extra things.

29:53.827 --> 29:57.793
- Mm-hmm. Big heart too, I see.

29:57.793 --> 30:00.827
- No, because I don't know where
she's gonna put them because

30:00.827 --> 30:03.482
that damn girl is
about to be homeless.

30:03.482 --> 30:05.137
- What?

30:05.137 --> 30:06.689
- She told me she's
turning 18 and getting ready

30:06.689 --> 30:08.724
to be put out of foster care.

30:08.724 --> 30:13.310
- When?
- The fuck if I know.

30:13.310 --> 30:16.068
- Okay, I'll call her tomorrow.

30:16.068 --> 30:18.034
- There you go with
that big-ole heart.

30:18.034 --> 30:21.724
- Oh, is that--there
you go, leaving! Bye!

30:21.724 --> 30:23.827
- Okay, fine!
Bye, bitch!

30:23.827 --> 30:25.206
-Heh, bye, girl.

30:25.206 --> 30:27.068
- Miss you, kiss you,
don't wanna be you.

30:27.068 --> 30:29.034
Yes, you do!

30:36.724 --> 30:39.000
- You wanted to see me?
-Yeah, come in.

30:42.517 --> 30:44.793
Have a seat.

30:44.793 --> 30:49.793
- Look, I'm sorry
about last night.

30:49.793 --> 30:52.482
- What exactly
are you sorry for?

30:52.482 --> 30:55.103
- For leaving.

30:55.103 --> 30:57.827
-It's okay.
Blue handled it.

31:00.689 --> 31:02.689
- Okay.

31:02.689 --> 31:06.000
- Look, Doc, it's over, okay?

31:06.000 --> 31:07.655
- No, thank you.

31:07.655 --> 31:11.517
I mean, the motherfucker
was gonna kill me.

31:11.517 --> 31:13.068
- Yes, he was.

31:13.068 --> 31:16.793
- And I owe you.
- Yes, you do.

31:16.793 --> 31:19.275
- Look, I could do just
about anything for you.

31:19.275 --> 31:24.103
I just--I can't
have no bodies on me.

31:24.103 --> 31:27.103
- Weak stomach?
- I just can't do that.

31:27.103 --> 31:31.172
Like...that's some
20 to life type shit.

31:31.172 --> 31:33.482
- Not if you do it right.

31:33.482 --> 31:37.448
- Yeah, I get that,
but what about Tina?

31:37.448 --> 31:39.482
- What about her?

31:39.482 --> 31:41.551
- You not afraid she
gonna say something?

31:43.379 --> 31:46.758
- Look at my face.
Does it look worried?

31:46.758 --> 31:48.448
-No, but...

31:50.000 --> 31:54.103
-But, what?
You think she will?

31:54.103 --> 31:58.137
- I don't know.
-Okay.

31:58.137 --> 32:01.241
Well, I'll pay her a
visit just to make sure.

32:01.241 --> 32:03.758
- You think that's wise?

32:03.758 --> 32:08.034
- I think you should get dressed
and get ready for tonight.

32:08.034 --> 32:11.137
- All right.
- Thank you.

32:11.137 --> 32:13.379
- See you, Madam.

32:26.724 --> 32:29.103
- Come in!

32:29.103 --> 32:32.758
-Hey, Madam.
- Hey.

32:32.758 --> 32:34.689
- I came across some footage
online of the guys and myself

32:34.689 --> 32:36.965
doing various routines.

32:36.965 --> 32:38.896
Not sure who recorded
it or posted it,

32:38.896 --> 32:41.275
but it popped up
on my Explorer page.

32:41.275 --> 32:45.137
Anyway, a few people
have reposted it.

32:45.137 --> 32:48.172
- I have a strict no-phone,
no-filming policy.

32:48.172 --> 32:52.068
- I know. But this
may not be a bad thing.

32:52.068 --> 32:53.586
If it goes viral,

32:53.586 --> 32:57.931
it could create even
more buzz for the club.

32:57.931 --> 33:01.517
- More buzz does
mean more customers.

33:01.517 --> 33:03.172
All right.

33:03.172 --> 33:05.827
But we need to figure out how
to monetize it moving forward.

33:05.827 --> 33:07.827
- I know. Don't reveal
any of the customers,

33:07.827 --> 33:10.517
short clips of the dances--
- Give them just enough--

33:10.517 --> 33:12.448
- --of the experience.
- Exactly.

33:13.344 --> 33:18.034
All right. Go with it.

33:18.034 --> 33:21.034
- Done deal.

33:21.034 --> 33:23.344
- Let the fellows know I'll be
in the locker room in a second

33:23.344 --> 33:25.000
for roll call.
- Will do.

33:27.965 --> 33:29.827
Gracias, Madam.

33:29.827 --> 33:31.310
- Thank you, papi.

33:42.310 --> 33:47.793
-Hey, ladies!
The doors of Eden are now open.

34:32.241 --> 34:35.000
- Excuse me.
- What?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.344
- There are no photos allowed.

34:37.344 --> 34:39.344
-Shoot, as much
as I paid to get in here?

34:41.448 --> 34:44.344
- How much did you pay?
- Twenty damn dollars.

34:46.448 --> 34:48.551
- Yeah, I can tell
that's a lot for you

34:48.551 --> 34:50.137
by your shoes and your weave.

34:50.137 --> 34:54.000
Look, I run
a nice establishment.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.965
And for the privacy
of my customers,

34:55.965 --> 35:00.655
there are no photos allowed.

35:00.655 --> 35:04.103
- Is there a problem?
- Y'all bitches crazy.

35:06.620 --> 35:09.413
- Did she just call me a--
- I got her.

35:09.413 --> 35:11.793
- No, no, no.
- You got who? You got who?

35:11.793 --> 35:14.793
- I want this one.
Are you crazy?

35:19.379 --> 35:22.137
Hey, stop the music.
Y'all get off the stage.

35:22.137 --> 35:25.413
Excuse me, everybody!

35:25.413 --> 35:28.000
Now, I was talking to--

35:28.000 --> 35:29.413
What is your name?

35:29.413 --> 35:32.655
- Keisha.
My nose is bleeding!

35:32.655 --> 35:35.000
- I was talking to Keisha
My Nose Is Bleeding,

35:35.000 --> 35:38.793
and I told her that
no photos were allowed.

35:38.793 --> 35:41.103
And she proceeded
to call me a bitch.

35:41.103 --> 35:42.793
-Ooh!

35:42.793 --> 35:45.413
- Exactly.

35:45.413 --> 35:48.620
Y'all know I frown
on that shit, right?

35:48.620 --> 35:52.275
So, Keisha
My Nose Is Bleeding

35:52.275 --> 35:55.551
is no longer allowed
in my establishment.

35:55.551 --> 35:57.586
Now, if I see her
ass around here again,

35:57.586 --> 36:00.517
Keisha My Nose Is Bleeding,

36:00.517 --> 36:02.793
more than your nose
will be bleeding.

36:02.793 --> 36:04.103
You got me?

36:04.103 --> 36:07.862
- Get the fuck out!

36:07.862 --> 36:09.103
-Get out!

36:13.379 --> 36:15.689
- All right.
Now start the music.

36:15.689 --> 36:16.793
Have fun, ladies!

37:06.655 --> 37:07.862
- Hey.

37:11.310 --> 37:12.655
I want you guys to go over there

37:12.655 --> 37:16.275
and show Ms. Tandy
a little extra attention.

37:16.275 --> 37:18.000
- Anything we should know?

37:18.000 --> 37:21.413
- Well, she's one of my elites,
so if you take good care of her,

37:21.413 --> 37:23.068
she'll take good care of you.

37:23.068 --> 37:25.344
Make sure she has a good time.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.586
- We can handle that.

37:27.586 --> 37:30.689
- Her and her friends
always pay well.

37:30.689 --> 37:32.068
Mm-hmm.

38:02.448 --> 38:05.448
- Yo.
What up with that?

38:05.448 --> 38:07.586
- Ms. Adams.

38:07.586 --> 38:09.413
- That's the same lady
who made the tamales?

38:09.413 --> 38:10.896
- Yeah.
- Damn, that look good.

38:10.896 --> 38:12.379
That's the same lady
with the carrot cake?

38:12.379 --> 38:13.862
- Yes.

38:16.034 --> 38:18.689
- Yo, Fuego, let me
get a chunk of that, bro.

38:18.689 --> 38:21.310
- Help yourself.
Just save me some.

38:21.310 --> 38:23.241
- Is it that same thick chick
that brought those chicken wings

38:23.241 --> 38:24.793
a couple of weeks ago?

38:24.793 --> 38:26.517
- Yes, this is from the woman
who brought the tamales,

38:26.517 --> 38:27.724
the cake, and the wings.
Ay dios mio!

38:29.965 --> 38:32.517
-You get
fat, you get fired.

38:32.517 --> 38:34.379
And they're eating lasagna.

38:34.379 --> 38:36.310
You better keep that shit tight.

38:54.517 --> 38:57.724
- Yo.
- Hey.

38:59.517 --> 39:02.344
What you doin'?

39:02.344 --> 39:05.172
- About to eat something.

39:05.172 --> 39:08.655
-I can't
believe she killed him.

39:08.655 --> 39:11.482
- What?
- Madam.

39:11.482 --> 39:14.551
She's so cold-blooded.

39:14.551 --> 39:18.241
-Yo, what the fuck
is you talkin' about?

39:18.241 --> 39:21.310
-Doc, you know
that she killed Allen.

39:21.310 --> 39:23.758
- Look, Tina, what did
I tell you about calling me

39:23.758 --> 39:25.379
when you smoking that shit?

39:25.379 --> 39:27.379
- What?

39:27.379 --> 39:29.620
- Look, get off my phone.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.344
-Doc, you know she--

39:40.724 --> 39:43.344
- He saw her.
I know he did.

39:43.344 --> 39:44.862
- I believe you.

39:44.862 --> 39:46.517
- This woman is out of control.

39:46.517 --> 39:47.931
- I know that.

39:47.931 --> 39:51.758
And it's my job to
get her under control.

39:51.758 --> 39:53.793
So don't worry about it.

39:53.793 --> 39:55.448
I got it.

39:55.448 --> 39:59.206
Nothing is gonna
happen to you.

39:59.206 --> 40:04.000
- You don't know how she is.
You didn't see her kill him.

40:04.000 --> 40:09.206
- Tina, I understand that.
But I need you to stay calm.

40:09.206 --> 40:14.793
