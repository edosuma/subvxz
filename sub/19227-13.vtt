WEBVTT

00:02.555 --> 00:06.167
"PSA." "PSA." I put it on here,

00:06.267 --> 00:08.359
I just have no idea what it means.

00:08.394 --> 00:10.995
Pedicure Saturday afternoon?

00:11.030 --> 00:14.098
No, that would just be setting
myself up for disappointment.

00:14.134 --> 00:15.967
Pick shiny automobile?

00:16.001 --> 00:17.368
Are we getting a new car?

00:17.403 --> 00:19.137
Really? There's even less chance of that

00:19.172 --> 00:20.938
than me getting a pedicure.

00:20.974 --> 00:23.040
PSA.

00:23.076 --> 00:24.976
Pat Sajak arrives.

00:25.011 --> 00:27.245
No way. I sent
that letter four years ago.

00:27.280 --> 00:28.412
I got it.

00:28.548 --> 00:31.148
Stop being annoying.

00:31.284 --> 00:33.217
- Those aren't the right letters.
- I know.

00:33.252 --> 00:35.152
If it were up to me,

00:35.188 --> 00:36.554
we wouldn't be having this problem.

00:36.589 --> 00:40.157
I would've taken this activity
board digital years ago.

00:42.362 --> 00:44.628
<i>With a high-tech interface,</i>

00:44.664 --> 00:48.265
<i>real-time scheduling for
every member of the family,</i>

00:48.301 --> 00:51.268
<i>and the ability to delete
toilet scrubbing.</i>

00:53.573 --> 00:57.441
Instead, my mom erases
things with spit on a tissue.

00:57.477 --> 01:01.245
Sometimes I even wonder
how this came from that.

01:03.349 --> 01:05.416
Oh, no, now I remember.

01:05.450 --> 01:08.519
- Public service announcement.
- What with a capital huh?

01:08.554 --> 01:10.874
Remember we saw that commercial
about visiting the elderly?

01:15.194 --> 01:16.293
BOTH: Awww!

01:16.329 --> 01:18.429
HARLEY: That's so sweet.

01:25.505 --> 01:28.305
She gave her her luffy.

01:28.341 --> 01:30.608
Those old people need us.

01:30.643 --> 01:33.177
We should be helping, too.

01:33.212 --> 01:34.578
Mm-hmm.

01:34.614 --> 01:36.580
We signed up to volunteer Saturday

01:36.616 --> 01:38.449
at the retirement community.

01:38.484 --> 01:40.484
I'd like to help old people,
but not today.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.420
What about next week?
They'll be even older,

01:42.455 --> 01:44.488
so it'll be that much nicer
to help them by them.

01:44.524 --> 01:46.323
You think I wanna spend my Saturday

01:46.359 --> 01:48.259
cutting up food for cranky people?

01:48.294 --> 01:50.361
I can do that right here,
but we made a commitment.

01:50.396 --> 01:52.396
Fine.

01:52.432 --> 01:54.532
But next time, we fast forward
through the commercials.

01:54.567 --> 01:56.634
Georgie, Ethan, you're on laundry duty.

01:56.669 --> 01:59.437
You're breaking up, Mom.

01:59.472 --> 02:01.472
Hey, Mom, can I borrow 20 for the mall?

02:01.507 --> 02:04.442
The good news is, you can have your 20.

02:04.477 --> 02:07.344
The bad news is,
you're babysitting Daphne,

02:07.380 --> 02:09.580
and the worst news is,
I only have a ten.

02:09.615 --> 02:11.215
Not fair. I hate taking her to the mall.

02:11.250 --> 02:13.384
I hate when she takes me to the mall.

02:13.419 --> 02:17.188
Then it's totally fair. No one's happy.

02:17.223 --> 02:19.223
Besides, about time you did
more to help out around here.

02:19.258 --> 02:21.098
Otherwise, having seven
kids was a total waste.

02:23.229 --> 02:26.397
I mean for chores. You're
each a gift from heaven.

02:26.432 --> 02:28.365
Was that last part an afterthought?

02:28.401 --> 02:30.234
I felt it was an afterthought.

02:30.269 --> 02:32.303
Let's be honest. Half of
us were an afterthought.

02:32.338 --> 02:33.437
Speak for yourself.

02:34.507 --> 02:36.540
I know going to Golden Horizons

02:36.576 --> 02:38.576
is a sacrifice,
but it's for the seniors.

02:38.611 --> 02:41.579
Oh, but before we go, I have the SWTO.

02:41.614 --> 02:43.247
I just added that.

02:43.282 --> 02:45.382
Start writing things out.

03:43.376 --> 03:44.475
Hello.

03:47.180 --> 03:49.246
(loudly) Excuse me.

03:49.282 --> 03:51.382
Is this Golden Horizons?

03:52.652 --> 03:56.187
Poor thing. Doesn't even
know we're talking to him.

03:56.222 --> 03:58.355
Harley, it's gonna be a sacrifice,

03:58.391 --> 04:01.158
but it's for the seniors.

04:04.463 --> 04:06.430
- Whoa!
- Sorry.

04:06.465 --> 04:08.499
I thought you might be chilly.

04:08.534 --> 04:11.435
No, I wasn't chilly. I was chillin'

04:11.470 --> 04:13.337
before racquetball.

04:14.540 --> 04:16.507
Listenin' to the Beebs.

04:16.541 --> 04:18.442
Yeah, the kid's really turned it around.

04:18.476 --> 04:20.110
It's the good part.

04:20.146 --> 04:21.579
That is not what I expected.

04:27.220 --> 04:30.154
And this is not what I expected.

04:30.189 --> 04:31.555
Hi, I'm Kelly.
Welcome to Golden Horizons.

04:31.591 --> 04:33.490
You must be the Diazes.

04:33.526 --> 04:36.327
Yes, we're so happy
to be giving our time.

04:36.362 --> 04:38.529
By the way, it took us
ten minutes to park.

04:38.564 --> 04:39.887
Does that count towards
our volunteer hours?

04:39.911 --> 04:41.299
No, but we validate.

04:41.300 --> 04:43.200
And I get it. Most people think

04:43.236 --> 04:45.269
volunteering is just cutting
up food for cranky old people.

04:45.304 --> 04:47.538
Oh, so the cranky old people
cut up their own food?

04:47.573 --> 04:50.140
Actually, our residents are very active.

04:50.176 --> 04:52.509
No kidding. Softball, beach day,

04:52.545 --> 04:55.212
pottery class. What, no foot massages?

04:55.248 --> 04:56.380
Spa day Tuesday.

04:56.415 --> 04:58.282
Harley, when it comes time
for me and your dad

04:58.317 --> 05:00.417
to go to Golden Horizons,
and you can only afford one,

05:00.453 --> 05:02.253
I call dibs.

05:02.288 --> 05:03.959
I'm not sure what you need us for.

05:03.984 --> 05:05.185
From what I'm seeing,

05:05.209 --> 05:07.125
the residents should be
volunteering at our house.

05:07.126 --> 05:08.559
You provide interaction
with young people.

05:08.594 --> 05:10.461
That's so important.

05:10.496 --> 05:13.130
They love when you take
a class, or just visit.

05:13.165 --> 05:14.465
Oh, you should start
with Mr. Kibbenshaw.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.367
Do you play racquetball, too?

05:16.402 --> 05:18.302
Racquetball?

05:18.337 --> 05:20.304
I didn't work my butt off for 50 years

05:20.339 --> 05:23.207
to chase a ball around
like a golden retriever.

05:23.242 --> 05:26.110
Everything here is go, do, and move,

05:26.145 --> 05:30.147
so my children don't feel bad
about not visiting me.

05:30.182 --> 05:33.250
(nervous chuckle) Every
rose must have its thorn.

05:33.286 --> 05:35.152
Hey, Kelly.

05:35.187 --> 05:38.155
Hey, you want me to drop 'em
by the swing dance class?

05:38.190 --> 05:40.324
They can meet the rest of the gang.

05:40.359 --> 05:42.226
As long as you don't make 'em late for

05:42.261 --> 05:44.328
the food from around the world buffet.

05:44.363 --> 05:46.163
It's true what they say.

05:46.198 --> 05:48.332
Volunteering does make you feel good.

05:51.270 --> 05:53.237
Sometimes I wish Mom and
Dad had an extra kid.

05:53.272 --> 05:55.339
One just in charge of laundry.

05:55.374 --> 05:57.341
I think we are those extra kids.

06:01.480 --> 06:06.450
There's no way I'm touching
Beast's dirty underwear.

06:06.485 --> 06:08.185
Because when he says they're dirty,

06:08.220 --> 06:10.187
you better believe him.

06:10.222 --> 06:12.122
Well, I'm not touching
Dad's work shirts.

06:12.158 --> 06:13.457
Man sweat and minnows?

06:13.492 --> 06:15.459
Not a winning combination.

06:15.494 --> 06:17.461
Mm-mm. You think anyone would notice

06:17.496 --> 06:20.164
if we just buried
all this in the backyard?

06:20.199 --> 06:23.167
You really want these clothes
seeping into the groundwater?

06:25.271 --> 06:27.504
I don't wanna go to the mall.

06:27.540 --> 06:30.441
It makes my tummy hurt.

06:30.476 --> 06:32.409
I don't wanna go to the discount store.

06:32.445 --> 06:34.311
It makes my tummy hurt.

06:34.347 --> 06:36.580
Please. That's straight
from my playbook.

06:36.615 --> 06:40.584
You got 20 minutes to dominate
all the jungle gym-ers,

06:40.619 --> 06:42.252
so enjoy it.

06:42.288 --> 06:44.221
Twenty minutes?

06:44.256 --> 06:47.191
Deathnee likes to know
her victims first.

06:47.226 --> 06:50.461
Everyone off the monkey bars right now!

06:50.496 --> 06:52.329
I've got limited time here.

06:53.366 --> 06:55.132
Did you hear me?

06:55.167 --> 06:56.500
Move it or lose it.

06:56.535 --> 06:59.436
Watching kids is exhausting.

06:59.472 --> 07:01.405
Totally.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.140
And I barely get paid for it.

07:03.175 --> 07:05.242
Right? Nobody recognizes how hard it is

07:05.277 --> 07:07.478
to be a nanny.
That's why I formed a group.

07:07.513 --> 07:09.413
- Oh, I'm not...
- Nannies For Nannies.

07:09.448 --> 07:12.082
We take turns watching each other's kids

07:12.118 --> 07:14.184
while the rest of us
go to the mall. Interested?

07:14.220 --> 07:16.487
Count me in.

07:16.522 --> 07:19.123
Us nannies have to stick together.

07:19.158 --> 07:20.524
Nanny strong.

07:20.559 --> 07:23.227
One question. Exactly how
long can I leave her?

07:23.262 --> 07:24.528
All day if you want.

07:24.563 --> 07:26.263
You just have to babysit
every fifth time.

07:26.298 --> 07:28.399
I like those odds.

07:28.434 --> 07:31.435
Anything we should know?
Asthma, allergies?

07:31.470 --> 07:34.371
Oh, there's a lipstick
that kinda makes my face...

07:34.407 --> 07:36.540
You're talking about her.

07:36.575 --> 07:39.576
Nah, she'll outlive us all.

07:42.381 --> 07:45.249
I'm going to need five more minutes.

07:45.284 --> 07:48.519
I'm about to expand my territory
to the ladybug on the swing.

07:48.554 --> 07:51.422
What if I said I found a way
for you to stay at the park

07:51.457 --> 07:53.190
while I go to the mall?

07:53.225 --> 07:55.192
I'd say there's hope for you yet.

07:57.263 --> 07:58.529
Gotta give it to you, Mom.

07:58.564 --> 08:00.397
You're a mean paintball player.

08:00.433 --> 08:02.132
Hey, you might've had a shot at me

08:02.168 --> 08:03.467
if Larry hadn't provided cover.

08:03.502 --> 08:05.402
To be honest, I didn't think

08:05.438 --> 08:07.271
you'd shoot a senior
citizen in the back.

08:07.306 --> 08:09.373
Only because it felt wrong
to shoot you in the face.

08:09.408 --> 08:11.308
That's wrong?

08:11.343 --> 08:13.210
Oh, I better go apologize to Matilda.

08:13.245 --> 08:15.212
Hello, Diazes.

08:15.247 --> 08:16.246
I hope you're enjoying your day with us.

08:16.282 --> 08:18.115
Are you kidding?

08:18.150 --> 08:20.350
A swing class, paintball,
now an international buffet.

08:20.386 --> 08:23.287
Do you guys do takeout?
I didn't plan dinner.

08:23.322 --> 08:25.389
It sounds like we'll
be seeing you next Saturday.

08:25.424 --> 08:27.391
Wait, it's over?

08:27.426 --> 08:31.495
It's only been... wow, six hours.

08:33.265 --> 08:35.399
I can't believe my mom and I
had so much fun together.

08:35.433 --> 08:38.235
The last time I had her
to myself for six hours

08:38.270 --> 08:40.136
was when we both had sinus infections.

08:40.172 --> 08:44.541
Way too much of our conversation
was about the color of our snot.

08:44.577 --> 08:46.543
Unless you wanna come back earlier.

08:46.579 --> 08:49.213
Is tomorrow too soon?
What time are you guys open?

08:49.248 --> 08:51.315
I don't know, we don't
wanna overstay our welcome.

08:51.350 --> 08:52.549
You already have.

08:52.585 --> 08:55.385
But Mom, tomorrow is
ice cream sundae Sunday.

08:55.421 --> 08:58.222
Well, what kind of volunteers
would we be

08:58.257 --> 09:00.097
if we let these people
split their own bananas?

09:01.227 --> 09:02.493
Tomorrow it is.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.230
Uh, guys.

09:09.265 --> 09:11.265
What happened here?

09:11.300 --> 09:13.300
Or more importantly, what didn't happen?

09:13.336 --> 09:16.103
We did half of it. The
"never touched a butt" half.

09:16.139 --> 09:19.173
Aw, you left
the stinky butt stuff for me?

09:19.208 --> 09:21.041
You shouldn't have.

09:21.077 --> 09:22.443
Well, there goes my day tomorrow.

09:22.478 --> 09:25.312
But Mom, we're supposed to go
back to Golden Horizons

09:25.348 --> 09:27.214
on <i> Sunday.</i>

09:27.250 --> 09:28.449
They'll go <i> bananas</i> if we're not there.

09:28.484 --> 09:31.152
Harley, I really think
we're being selfish.

09:33.189 --> 09:35.423
Heads up. If you're
going to scam your siblings,

09:35.458 --> 09:37.324
don't partner up with your mom.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.026
Well, your mom maybe.

09:39.061 --> 09:41.996
But mine, definitely not.

09:42.031 --> 09:44.298
There go our golden horizons.

09:44.333 --> 09:48.135
Why should we keep the joy of
volunteering to ourselves?

09:48.171 --> 09:49.470
We'll stay home tomorrow,

09:49.505 --> 09:51.439
and let Ethan and Georgie
tend to the elderly.

09:51.474 --> 09:53.340
You better bring a change of clothes.

09:53.376 --> 09:55.376
You're gonna get really dirty.

09:55.411 --> 09:58.112
Dirty? How many bedpans
are you scrubbing?

10:00.149 --> 10:02.183
I'd rather not say.

10:02.218 --> 10:04.018
We wouldn't wanna rob you
of the satisfaction

10:04.053 --> 10:07.121
of giving back to
those who need it most.

10:07.156 --> 10:09.089
Yeah, what kind of people would we be?

10:09.125 --> 10:11.225
Bad ones. That's who.

10:11.260 --> 10:13.093
We'll finish the laundry tomorrow.

10:13.129 --> 10:14.295
Have fun.

10:19.502 --> 10:22.203
Whoa! Did you see that?

10:22.238 --> 10:24.171
I had no idea
she had those kind of moves.

10:24.207 --> 10:27.441
Wow, I never thought my mom
would be my partner in crime.

10:27.477 --> 10:30.077
I also never thought
I would say the phrase

10:30.112 --> 10:32.279
"Eat paint, old man!"

10:32.315 --> 10:35.049
Volunteering really
broadens your horizons.

10:36.419 --> 10:38.252
Ready to do some volunteering?

10:38.287 --> 10:41.222
It'll be a sacrifice,
but it's for the seniors.

10:42.391 --> 10:47.461
♪ ♪

10:52.401 --> 10:58.072
♪ ♪

11:06.048 --> 11:08.182
This whole volunteering thing
really has paid off.

11:08.217 --> 11:11.218
I know. We even got to go
to the butterfly sanctuary,

11:11.254 --> 11:13.220
and our family's banned from there.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.155
I meant you and me.

11:15.191 --> 11:19.126
I'm usually so busy keeping
the Diaz train on the tracks,

11:19.161 --> 11:22.129
I barely get to spend
any time at Harley's station.

11:23.332 --> 11:27.134
To us... giving back.

11:33.309 --> 11:35.075
Cheers.

11:37.413 --> 11:40.147
Now remember, I'm
your nanny while you're here.

11:40.182 --> 11:42.182
Stop speaking to me like a child.

11:42.218 --> 11:43.517
I can play pretend.

11:43.553 --> 11:45.352
Hi, Rachel. Hey, Daphne.

11:45.388 --> 11:47.221
Thanks for hangin' out with us today.

11:47.256 --> 11:50.124
- You must really love your nanny.
- Almost like a sister.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.227
I'm off to the mall,

11:53.262 --> 11:56.096
but you're in good hands with Natalie.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.264
Um, Nanny.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.433
My shoe's untied.

11:59.468 --> 12:01.235
You can tie your own shoe.

12:01.270 --> 12:03.470
But I need my nanny to do it.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.110
Oh.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.246
And here's my gum.

12:16.085 --> 12:17.205
I want to save it for later.

12:18.521 --> 12:21.188
Wow, she's a piece of work.

12:21.223 --> 12:22.489
I'd love to see
the family she came from.

12:22.525 --> 12:24.258
Oh, they're all crazy.

12:24.293 --> 12:26.427
After their first kid,
everything went downhill.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.332
ETHAN: That's everything.

12:33.436 --> 12:35.469
Call Mom and tell her we're done.

12:35.504 --> 12:38.372
And don't tell her about
the things we put back dirty.

12:40.443 --> 12:43.310
(ringtone chimes)

12:45.348 --> 12:47.114
Hello.

12:47.149 --> 12:49.283
Hey, Mom, we're done with laundry.

12:49.318 --> 12:52.386
No ifs, ands, and all the butts
we didn't do the first time.

12:52.421 --> 12:53.454
Anyway, when are you coming home?

12:53.489 --> 12:56.123
Could be a while.

12:56.158 --> 12:59.426
We're in the middle of
toenail clipping here.

12:59.462 --> 13:01.462
<i>Look, you've worked hard.
Why don't you guys relax,</i>

13:01.497 --> 13:03.297
<i>rent a movie.</i>

13:03.332 --> 13:05.199
You've been working
your fingers to the bone.

13:05.234 --> 13:08.002
So enjoy. Nothing over 5.99. Bye.

13:09.171 --> 13:11.105
Genius.

13:11.140 --> 13:14.008
Not to sound braggy, but I
couldn't have done better myself.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.242
Hate to tell you, kid.

13:15.277 --> 13:17.378
It's not my first time at the rodeo.

13:17.413 --> 13:20.280
Oh, speaking of which, we should
sign up for that trip to the rodeo.

13:20.316 --> 13:22.149
Totally.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.387
I'd say order a horror flick,

13:26.422 --> 13:30.190
but after that laundry pile, I don't
think anything could scare me.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.129
Finally.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:44.774 --> 13:46.740
GEORGIE: That's adorable.

13:47.143 --> 13:51.245
Aw, she gave her her luffy.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.081
We can't just sit here watching movies

13:54.116 --> 13:56.083
while Mom and Harley are changing lives.

14:00.713 --> 14:02.881
- This feels so good.
- Mm.

14:02.906 --> 14:04.458
Oh, push harder, Felicia.

14:04.493 --> 14:06.786
Don't be afraid to bring the heat.

14:06.811 --> 14:08.911
You people still here?

14:09.011 --> 14:10.541
Can't you just let me get old

14:10.565 --> 14:12.467
without trying to make it
a happy experience?

14:12.468 --> 14:16.103
Even Mr. Kibbenshaw
can't kill this vibe.

14:16.138 --> 14:17.304
(laughs) Nope.

14:19.508 --> 14:21.341
Wow, you're right.

14:21.377 --> 14:24.180
Volunteering is hard work.

14:28.246 --> 14:31.247
Guys, great. You came down.

14:31.282 --> 14:33.249
We were just...

14:33.284 --> 14:34.517
Just...

14:36.387 --> 14:38.187
Uh, just trying out these new face bibs.

14:38.223 --> 14:39.355
Face bibs?

14:39.390 --> 14:42.091
For feeding the elderly.

14:42.127 --> 14:43.226
Through here.

14:43.261 --> 14:44.327
They call it anti-dribble feeding.

14:44.362 --> 14:46.095
Very technical.

14:46.131 --> 14:49.065
Don't try and pull
the face bib over our eyes.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.333
You were getting massages.

14:50.368 --> 14:52.168
In all fairness,

14:52.203 --> 14:54.504
we offered you the chance to volunteer.

14:54.539 --> 14:56.506
In all fairness,

14:56.541 --> 15:00.143
you neglected to mention... <i>everything.</i>

15:00.178 --> 15:02.211
You guys are living the life.

15:02.247 --> 15:04.180
At a retirement home, but still.

15:04.215 --> 15:05.348
We want in.

15:05.383 --> 15:07.150
You're right.

15:07.185 --> 15:08.417
We shouldn't have
kept this to ourselves.

15:08.453 --> 15:10.186
Go check in with Kelly.

15:10.221 --> 15:11.981
I'm sure they would love
two more volunteers.

15:13.358 --> 15:16.259
Well, that was fun while it lasted.

15:16.294 --> 15:19.362
Should've known the Diaz Duo
would come to an end.

15:19.397 --> 15:22.498
- The what?
- Diaz Duo.

15:22.534 --> 15:24.500
It's our sneaky crime team name.

15:24.536 --> 15:27.069
I was gonna make T-shirts
that say that tomorrow,

15:27.105 --> 15:28.345
but guess there's no point now.

15:29.541 --> 15:32.108
You know what?

15:32.143 --> 15:36.379
The Diaz Duo doesn't
have to call it quits.

15:36.414 --> 15:40.149
Georgie and Ethan left that pile
of laundry for me yesterday.

15:40.185 --> 15:42.251
Maybe they deserve a little payback.

15:44.088 --> 15:45.488
<i>Imagine if Georgie
had to spend the afternoon</i>

15:45.523 --> 15:47.323
<i>with Mr. Kibbenshaw.</i>

15:47.358 --> 15:50.259
So... tell me a little
bit about yourself.

15:50.295 --> 15:53.462
Well, I don't like friendly people.

15:53.498 --> 15:57.200
And I don't like nosy people
asking me questions about myself.

15:59.137 --> 16:01.270
<i>And think about how Ethan's
music will go over here.</i>

16:01.306 --> 16:03.439
Any requests?

16:03.474 --> 16:05.374
Anyone?

16:05.410 --> 16:08.277
Yeah, I got one. Take a lesson!

16:12.317 --> 16:14.250
<i>And believe me,</i>

16:14.285 --> 16:16.319
<i>they'll be outta here in no time.</i>

16:18.256 --> 16:19.422
Am I going too far?

16:19.457 --> 16:22.191
It is kind of sneaky.

16:24.062 --> 16:26.162
I've never felt closer
to you than I do right now!

16:27.498 --> 16:30.166
Hey, Nat, here's my little angel.
See you at 5:00.

16:30.201 --> 16:33.202
Wait up. It's your turn
to watch the kids today.

16:33.238 --> 16:35.304
What? No, it's not my turn
for a couple of weeks,

16:35.340 --> 16:37.273
when I was probably gonna be sick.

16:37.308 --> 16:39.342
Yeah, sorry, Carla got
a tell-all book deal

16:39.377 --> 16:41.043
about her family and quit.

16:41.079 --> 16:42.245
Newbies get subbed in first.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.347
Here's my little angel. See you at 5:00.

16:44.382 --> 16:47.216
Please don't. Don't leave me here.

16:47.252 --> 16:49.218
These shoes aren't meant
to walk on grass.

16:49.254 --> 16:52.121
So what's the plan, Nanny?

16:56.261 --> 16:58.227
King me.

16:58.263 --> 17:00.129
Your family is just the best.

17:00.164 --> 17:02.231
Throwing Mr. Kibbenshaw
a birthday party this afternoon,

17:02.267 --> 17:04.200
that's huge.

17:04.234 --> 17:06.269
- A party?
- Us? How?

17:06.304 --> 17:08.037
Georgie said you would.

17:08.071 --> 17:10.373
But you have to have a birthday party.

17:10.407 --> 17:13.242
It's not every day someone turns 80.

17:13.278 --> 17:14.443
My family will throw you one.

17:14.479 --> 17:17.046
I hate birthday parties.

17:17.080 --> 17:18.414
Well...

17:18.449 --> 17:21.150
you know those kids
you're always complaining about?

17:21.185 --> 17:23.286
It would make them have to
drive all the way out here.

17:23.320 --> 17:26.222
Making my kids suffer?

17:26.257 --> 17:29.258
You know how to sweet talk me.

17:29.294 --> 17:32.094
And if you really want to torture them,

17:32.130 --> 17:34.397
I'll even get my brother to play guitar.

17:34.432 --> 17:35.432
He's right there.

17:37.368 --> 17:39.268
Darn Georgie and her big heart.

17:39.304 --> 17:42.204
Now it is Mr. Kibbenshaw's
80th birthday,

17:42.240 --> 17:43.439
so it needs to be really special.

17:43.474 --> 17:46.409
Entertainment, a fancy
cake, lunch for 20,

17:46.444 --> 17:50.179
taking into consideration all of
our residents' dietary needs.

17:50.214 --> 17:52.214
Glad I don't have to do it.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.250
You know what? I'm thinking...

17:54.285 --> 17:56.118
he is such a grump.

17:56.154 --> 17:57.520
Maybe he wouldn't want a big to-do.

17:57.555 --> 17:59.488
Yeah, Mr. Kibbenshaw totally seems like

17:59.524 --> 18:01.357
a less-is-more kind of guy.

18:01.392 --> 18:04.293
Like way less. Like maybe just a card.

18:04.329 --> 18:06.295
You know, for people
who have been here so much,

18:06.331 --> 18:09.198
you'd think you'd want to
go the extra mile

18:09.233 --> 18:11.233
for our residents. Now if you don't,

18:11.269 --> 18:13.269
there are other places where
you don't have to give so much.

18:13.304 --> 18:15.137
Or get so much.

18:15.173 --> 18:18.174
Or we could throw him
a huge party at the park.

18:18.209 --> 18:19.308
That'd be great.

18:19.344 --> 18:21.277
Mr. Kibbenshaw hasn't been outside

18:21.312 --> 18:23.232
since someone accidentally
pulled the fire alarm.

18:26.050 --> 18:28.351
Stripey shirt, get back here!

18:28.386 --> 18:31.287
Kid who took my shoe,
give me back my shoe!

18:33.224 --> 18:36.125
Okay, everybody,
we're gonna play a game.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.461
It's called run.

18:38.496 --> 18:42.398
Whoever runs to the end
of the park and back first wins.

18:42.433 --> 18:46.202
Run! Run until your tiny legs give out.

18:52.110 --> 18:54.143
"Happy birthday, Keanu."

18:54.178 --> 18:56.379
Keanu Kibbenshaw.

18:56.414 --> 18:59.048
Would not have guessed that.

18:59.083 --> 19:01.350
I've never been
a big fan of your family,

19:01.386 --> 19:04.120
but I hate this
less than I thought I would.

19:04.155 --> 19:07.089
If that's a compliment, we'll take it.

19:08.493 --> 19:10.359
Look at us.

19:10.395 --> 19:13.329
We volunteered here because we
wanted to make a difference,

19:13.364 --> 19:15.197
and we just did.

19:15.233 --> 19:17.199
Because of our family,

19:17.235 --> 19:19.402
Mr. Kibbenshaw got a wonderful party.

19:19.437 --> 19:21.237
Yeah, it feels good.

19:21.272 --> 19:23.039
Yeah.

19:29.313 --> 19:31.480
- Rachel!
- Cake!

19:36.354 --> 19:39.021
(chuckling)

19:39.057 --> 19:41.290
Mr. Kibbenshaw?

19:44.495 --> 19:46.128
I'm really sorry this happened.

19:48.433 --> 19:51.367
I thought you'd be mad.

19:51.402 --> 19:53.402
Mad?

19:53.438 --> 19:55.404
I have never laughed so hard in my life.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.041
Watching your faces

19:59.077 --> 20:01.177
when y'all wiped out that cake
and ruined my party.

20:01.212 --> 20:02.278
(laughing)

20:02.313 --> 20:04.346
That's a memory I'll never forget.

20:04.382 --> 20:06.382
When it comes to spoiling parties,

20:06.417 --> 20:09.085
that's when my family really shines.

20:12.523 --> 20:15.191
I've got an idea for
next week's activity.

20:15.226 --> 20:17.159
How to remove common stains,

20:17.195 --> 20:18.527
like, say, frosting.

20:18.563 --> 20:21.363
I don't think we'll be
needing your family next week.

20:21.399 --> 20:23.232
We're gonna switch our volunteer program

20:23.267 --> 20:24.433
to something a little easier.

20:24.469 --> 20:26.202
Therapy dogs.

20:35.146 --> 20:37.480
You are so grounded.

20:37.515 --> 20:39.215
Let's think about this.

20:39.250 --> 20:40.549
If you hadn't volunteered,

20:40.585 --> 20:42.518
I wouldn't have had to babysit.

20:42.553 --> 20:44.386
So in a way, this is your fault.

20:44.422 --> 20:47.089
You're right. You're off the hook.

20:47.125 --> 20:48.457
- Really?
- No.

20:48.493 --> 20:50.226
I just wanted you to see
what it felt like

20:50.261 --> 20:52.261
when someone says crazy things to you.

20:55.199 --> 20:57.366
I can't believe we've
been replaced by dogs.

20:57.401 --> 20:59.502
Yeah, that's insulting.

20:59.537 --> 21:02.204
We threw a bad party. No one
had to pick up our poop.

21:04.342 --> 21:06.242
We've had a fun few days.

21:06.277 --> 21:08.177
We did a lot of cool stuff together.

21:08.212 --> 21:11.080
Yeah, we had a good run.

21:11.115 --> 21:13.349
Oh, well, looks like
that's the end of us

21:13.384 --> 21:15.184
making bad pottery and good cupcakes.

21:15.219 --> 21:17.386
Doesn't have to be.

21:17.421 --> 21:20.089
We can bake cupcakes right here.

21:20.124 --> 21:22.191
- Just the Diaz Duo.
- Really?

21:22.226 --> 21:25.361
Yeah. It's not like
we don't have a kitchen.

21:25.396 --> 21:28.464
Oh, that's what's under
all the dirty dishes.

21:28.499 --> 21:31.367
Not for long.

21:31.402 --> 21:33.536
Rachel needs a punishment.

21:33.571 --> 21:36.338
No reason why we can't
make that work to our advantage.

21:36.374 --> 21:38.407
<i>Wow. When one scheme goes down,</i>

21:38.442 --> 21:41.076
<i>she jumps right into the next.</i>

21:41.112 --> 21:43.512
<i>I guess Mom and I are a lot
more alike than I thought.</i>

21:43.548 --> 21:46.549
<i>Working the angles, taking big swings.</i>

21:46.584 --> 21:49.151
You want the slice with the
footprints or the grass?

21:49.187 --> 21:51.420
<i>And not afraid to get dirty.</i>

21:51.455 --> 21:53.389
Doesn't matter. I'm gonna
eat around it either way.

21:53.424 --> 21:56.425
Wow, you guys are a mess.

21:56.460 --> 21:59.461
Yep, you two are gonna have
a lot more laundry to do.

21:59.497 --> 22:01.030
- What?!
- Us?!

22:01.065 --> 22:03.165
Yeah. If you're gonna
put clothes back dirty,

22:03.201 --> 22:04.500
rub 'em with a dryer sheet first,

22:04.535 --> 22:06.135
like I do.

22:06.170 --> 22:08.337
(groans)

22:08.372 --> 22:12.208
And that takes care
of Ethan and Georgie.

22:17.348 --> 22:21.044
Mmm. Good.

22:21.069 --> 22:23.069
(laughing)
