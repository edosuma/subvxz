WEBVTT

00:16.399 --> 00:18.440
<i>Anybody home?</i>

00:19.120 --> 00:22.239
<i>Jack, it may as well
be the moon out here.</i>

00:22.277 --> 00:26.903
<i>If there ever was anybody home,
they've been gone 100,000 years or more.</i>

00:28.513 --> 00:31.265
<i>This world is most definitely Tal lak.</i>

00:31.274 --> 00:33.895
<i>Though it once supported life,
it is now extinct.</i>

00:33.911 --> 00:37.280
<i>Well, the probe picked up
an EM source coming from something.</i>

00:38.950 --> 00:40.359
<i>My guess,...</i>

00:40.429 --> 00:42.052
<i>.. that thing.</i>

00:55.142 --> 00:58.759
<i>I have the same EM frequencies
we picked up from the probe.</i>

00:58.740 --> 01:02.405
<i>Sir, this artefact, or whatever it is,
is definitely the source.</i>

01:03.097 --> 01:05.137
<i>Are we in danger?</i>

01:05.177 --> 01:08.381
<i>No, sir, I don't think so.
Not at the moment.</i>

01:08.376 --> 01:10.748
<i>But... I mean, this is incredible!</i>

01:10.774 --> 01:15.649
<i>If Daniel's right, this has been doing this
since Neanderthals were on Earth.</i>

01:15.572 --> 01:17.114
<i>Ah, that takes me back!</i>

01:17.171 --> 01:19.709
<i>Look at this writing. It's so tiny.</i>

01:19.730 --> 01:21.521
<i>What does it do?</i>

01:21.569 --> 01:25.695
<i>It's maintaining an interior
temperature of 33° Fahrenheit.</i>

01:25.647 --> 01:31.234
<i>It's generating an electromagnetic field
and emitting small amounts of radiation.</i>

01:31.126 --> 01:33.164
<i>Well, I knew that.</i>

01:33.763 --> 01:35.802
<i>Why does it do that?</i>

01:37.801 --> 01:41.716
<i>- I'm trying to make a threat assessment.
- I don't know what it is,...</i>

01:41.679 --> 01:46.174
<i>.. but it's got a power source more
advanced than anything we've ever seen.</i>

01:46.116 --> 01:48.156
<i>It's a time capsule.</i>

01:50.954 --> 01:53.243
<i>Well, that's an educated guess, but...</i>

01:53.274 --> 01:58.433
<i>Imagine your civilisation is facing
a great cataclysm and you know it.</i>

01:58.350 --> 02:03.772
<i>Wouldn't you leave something behind that
told whoever came after who you were?</i>

02:03.668 --> 02:06.539
<i>- Or how you died.
- Imagine what you could learn...</i>

02:06.548 --> 02:08.090
<i>.. about your own fate.</i>

02:08.788 --> 02:11.278
<i>When a Goa'uld's world
is taken by another,...</i>

02:11.305 --> 02:14.674
<i>.. he may leave behind the means
to destroy the conqueror.</i>

02:14.663 --> 02:16.324
<i>It might be a booby trap?</i>

02:17.223 --> 02:18.634
<i>Booby?</i>

02:18.703 --> 02:21.704
<i>We're not talking about the Goa'uld here.</i>

02:21.780 --> 02:26.192
<i>This civilisation went to great pains
to leave this artefact behind.</i>

02:26.139 --> 02:28.759
<i>Like a... message in a bottle.</i>

02:29.456 --> 02:33.751
<i>- You buyin' this, Teal'c?
- The benefit may outweigh the risk.</i>

02:33.694 --> 02:37.562
<i>Earth could sure use a power source
that lasts for thousands of years.</i>

02:37.533 --> 02:41.400
<i>All right. Pack it up. Let's go home.</i>

02:42.091 --> 02:44.131
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

04:20.644 --> 04:24.262
<i>We have the package, sir.
I advise level-3 precautions.</i>

04:24.242 --> 04:27.492
<i>Wormhole disengaged.
Support teams, go!</i>

04:27.480 --> 04:29.473
<i>Careful. It's heavy!</i>

04:29.519 --> 04:31.677
Start a spectral analysis right away.

04:31.718 --> 04:35.798
And input an imaging
of the outer surface into the computer.

04:35.755 --> 04:37.795
<i>Everything go as planned?</i>

04:37.836 --> 04:40.622
Oh, one small step, one giant leap, sir.

04:41.355 --> 04:44.307
We'll debrief in one hour.
Welcome home, SG-1.

04:52.149 --> 04:55.518
Well, we can add two more elements
to the periodic table.

04:55.627 --> 04:57.786
Lieutenant, I'd like to record this.

04:57.826 --> 04:59.865
<i>Whatever you say, Captain.</i>

05:00.024 --> 05:03.108
Try to relax, Graham,
or it's gonna be a long day.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.764
It's not the artefact.

05:04.824 --> 05:08.026
<i>He gets nervous like that
every time he's around you.</i>

05:08.021 --> 05:09.396
Maybe a crush.

05:09.461 --> 05:12.165
<i>Uh... we're recording now.</i>

05:15.577 --> 05:17.653
Thank you, Lieutenant.

05:22.535 --> 05:23.994
Oops.

05:24.055 --> 05:27.221
Hey, the artefact!
Notice the writing.

05:27.812 --> 05:30.302
So tiny it can't be read by the naked eye.

05:30.331 --> 05:34.659
<i>- What does it say?
- Uh, we think it's a set of instructions.</i>

05:34.610 --> 05:37.016
On... how to...?

05:37.048 --> 05:39.716
Open it. We think it, uh... opens.

05:41.125 --> 05:48.172
There's the equivalent of 1,000 pages
of text on the exterior surface alone.

05:48.002 --> 05:49.745
What about the interior?

05:49.802 --> 05:53.928
We know very little. Dr. Fraiser's
running a positron emission topography.

05:54.999 --> 05:58.747
You know I have the highest respect
for your abilities,...

05:59.478 --> 06:02.514
...but the NID wants a look at the thing.

06:02.516 --> 06:06.560
<i>I recommend against shipping
the artefact anywhere just yet, General.</i>

06:06.514 --> 06:10.012
Since the orb's function
has yet to be confirmed,...

06:09.992 --> 06:14.701
...it is best for it to remain
in close proximity to the Stargate.

06:14.629 --> 06:18.293
You're scheduled to visit P4G-881.

06:18.269 --> 06:23.428
A primordial world with no civilisation,
so no need for an archaeologist.

06:23.346 --> 06:26.630
I'm willing to delay that mission
for 24 hours...

06:26.625 --> 06:28.663
...in order to confirm your theory.

06:28.702 --> 06:31.240
- That's not enough time.
- But we'll take it.

06:31.262 --> 06:32.922
<i>Thank you.</i>

06:40.457 --> 06:42.913
Okay, let's try another X-ray series.

06:43.855 --> 06:45.894
Y- axis this time.

06:46.254 --> 06:47.797
<i>Sam?</i>

06:50.213 --> 06:52.252
Yeah.

06:52.812 --> 06:53.927
Okay.

06:54.011 --> 06:58.838
<i>Up until now I've been assuming
that this is a sort of page one.</i>

06:58.769 --> 07:03.264
<i>It's isolated from the other groupings.
Now I'm thinking it's numericaI.</i>

07:03.206 --> 07:08.081
- It may be the basis of their mathematics.
- Right. That's what I thought.

07:08.004 --> 07:11.954
So if these smaller symbols
represent exponents...

07:11.923 --> 07:15.790
Then this sequence grows exponentially
to become a very big number.

07:15.762 --> 07:17.800
Right. And that is...

07:18.959 --> 07:20.999
...information I can't use.

07:21.038 --> 07:24.536
Good morning, campers!
Sleep well? I did!

07:24.518 --> 07:31.348
- Oh, it can't be morning.
- Ah, but it is. We ship out at 1300 hours.

07:31.874 --> 07:34.495
Jack, talk to General Hammond.

07:34.512 --> 07:38.805
Nope. I want you both rested
and ready to go. That's an order.

07:40.269 --> 07:42.060
Yes, sir.

07:42.108 --> 07:43.567
Jack, come on!

07:43.627 --> 07:45.038
Daniel,...

07:45.105 --> 07:49.483
...SG-1 is a field unit, you know that.
Can't have it both ways.

07:49.425 --> 07:52.259
When we get back, you can... visit.

07:56.420 --> 08:00.370
<i>We've got a spike!
An EM spike across the wide band!</i>

08:00.339 --> 08:01.620
What?

08:01.699 --> 08:05.447
<i>Interior temperature is increasing -
40° Fahrenheit.</i>

08:05.416 --> 08:06.247
Captain?

08:06.336 --> 08:09.456
<i>- We haven't done anything.
- Maybe we woke it up.</i>

08:09.454 --> 08:11.696
<i>- 60°!
- Radiation levels?</i>

08:11.733 --> 08:15.518
<i>Uh, alpha particle generation
within the object's...</i>

08:15.492 --> 08:19.110
<i>.. magnetic field has increased 4... 600%!</i>

08:19.091 --> 08:22.542
Sir, I recommend
we return the artefact to P5C-353 now!

08:22.528 --> 08:24.605
Go tell them to start dialling.

08:24.648 --> 08:25.680
Go!

08:25.768 --> 08:27.807
<i>100°!</i>

08:29.245 --> 08:31.487
Any idea what we're dealing with here?

08:32.085 --> 08:33.912
No, sir.

08:34.883 --> 08:36.293
Whoa!

08:40.639 --> 08:43.344
I think we can rule out time capsule.

08:44.999 --> 08:47.240
<i>Start dialling in P5C-353!</i>

08:47.277 --> 08:49.649
- By whose orders?
- Colonel O'Neill.

08:49.676 --> 08:51.169
- Do it.
- Yes, sir.

08:51.235 --> 08:54.984
- Dr. Jackson?
- It's the artefact, sir. Something's wrong.

08:54.953 --> 08:57.955
<i>Temperature is still increasing - 110°.</i>

08:57.951 --> 08:59.943
We'll need to put our suits back on.

08:59.991 --> 09:03.193
We'll just open the gate
and throw it back through.

09:04.149 --> 09:06.188
Teal'c, give me a hand here.

09:10.907 --> 09:12.946
It does not wish to be removed.

09:12.985 --> 09:15.772
That's too damn bad.

09:28.057 --> 09:29.966
Chevron six encoded.

09:30.015 --> 09:32.139
<i>Out of the way, people!</i>

09:43.250 --> 09:45.919
<i>Chevron seven locked.</i>

09:55.445 --> 09:56.394
Get outta there!

10:04.400 --> 10:07.485
- Put the base on full alert!
- We need a medical team.

10:07.479 --> 10:11.772
Security to the embarkation room!
Medical team to the embarkation room!

10:13.995 --> 10:14.778
Teal'c...

10:15.836 --> 10:16.831
Kill it!

10:17.673 --> 10:18.836
Oh, God...

10:23.311 --> 10:26.227
Sir, the uh... Stargate.

10:28.070 --> 10:30.109
Shut it down.

10:49.938 --> 10:51.977
Colonel!

10:53.138 --> 10:56.553
It goes right through his shoulder
into the concrete.

10:56.536 --> 10:59.537
- Oh, my God!
- Get something to support his legs.

11:02.452 --> 11:06.201
<i>- Okay, what can you tell me?
- I don't know, but it's still hot.</i>

11:07.130 --> 11:08.923
Temperature's 133.

11:08.971 --> 11:12.339
This wound is too clean.
There should be more trauma.

11:12.328 --> 11:13.323
Where's Teal'c?

11:13.408 --> 11:15.234
It's gone through the scapula.

11:15.288 --> 11:15.986
Teal'c!

11:18.245 --> 11:18.860
Shoot it!

11:18.965 --> 11:21.124
- Sir!
- Shoot it!

11:22.004 --> 11:24.128
I suggest you observe
from the control room.

11:24.163 --> 11:25.823
Everybody out of here!

11:31.759 --> 11:33.466
Teal'c, fire when ready.

11:38.395 --> 11:40.636
With respect, General, this is a mistake.

11:40.674 --> 11:41.539
Why?

11:41.634 --> 11:45.418
We don't know how much staff energy
will go through into the colonel.

11:45.393 --> 11:46.934
Your objection is noted.

11:50.989 --> 11:53.028
Do it!

12:02.065 --> 12:03.642
Again!

12:12.100 --> 12:15.053
- No change.
- Sir, it just absorbed the energy.

12:16.937 --> 12:20.057
This weapon is ineffective.
I shall try another.

12:20.336 --> 12:21.581
<i>No!</i>

12:21.654 --> 12:25.817
Sir, that staff energy's gone somewhere.
We could be feeding it what it wants.

12:25.774 --> 12:28.311
I want a cutting torch down there.

12:28.332 --> 12:31.914
If it's made of the same alloys
as the shell on the orb itself,...

12:31.889 --> 12:35.638
...then it is several hundred times
stronger than steel.

12:35.610 --> 12:37.649
Sir, with your permission?

12:39.687 --> 12:41.264
<i>Colonel O'Neill,...</i>

12:41.326 --> 12:43.448
<i>.. this is going to take some time.</i>

12:58.317 --> 13:00.309
<i>I don't give a damn...</i>

13:00.357 --> 13:01.982
...what Colonel Maybourne says.
I've made my decision.

13:01.950 --> 13:03.538
...what Colonel Maybourne says.
I've made my decision.

13:03.596 --> 13:08.303
Unless I am ordered otherwise, I'm not
allowing anyone in or out of this facility...

13:08.232 --> 13:11.767
...until we can send the damn thing
back where it came from.

13:12.152 --> 13:14.191
<i>No, General. Thank you.</i>

13:15.470 --> 13:17.509
The NID people want to see it.

13:17.548 --> 13:19.625
After what it's done to the colonel?

13:19.668 --> 13:22.751
<i>Especially after what it's done.</i>

13:22.745 --> 13:26.279
They're hoping we've found a weapon
to use against the Goa'uld.

13:26.264 --> 13:30.640
- All I can tell them is what it isn't.
- General, I don't know what to say.

13:31.822 --> 13:35.072
I wanted the artefact
to be something wonderful.

13:35.061 --> 13:37.467
You have nothing to apologise for, son.

13:37.499 --> 13:40.832
We've brought things back
from all over the galaxy.

13:40.817 --> 13:43.568
One of them's finally
snapped us in the ass.

13:43.576 --> 13:46.744
We managed to collect
a significant amount of data, sir.

13:46.735 --> 13:50.518
Then I suggest you get to it.
Dismissed.

13:57.610 --> 14:04.110
This is Hammond. Lock up the mountain.
Authorisation code red-beta.

14:03.966 --> 14:06.005
Initiate Wildfire.

14:09.604 --> 14:13.518
<i>Attention.
Level-4 quarantine is now in effect.</i>

14:16.000 --> 14:19.001
<i>Switching to internal power
and life support.</i>

14:29.235 --> 14:30.230
Hot.

14:31.354 --> 14:32.812
I know.

14:32.874 --> 14:35.957
You've a very high fever
caused by an infection.

14:35.951 --> 14:40.364
I'm gonna give you a broad-spectrum
antibiotic to help fight it.

14:40.908 --> 14:46.068
<i>The artefact's internal temperature
just levelled off at 149° Fahrenheit.</i>

14:48.506 --> 14:49.917
Sergeant.

14:50.625 --> 14:53.080
Your progress here is unsatisfactory.

14:53.102 --> 14:57.514
Can't go any faster, sir. This is
the hardest stuff I've ever come across.

14:57.900 --> 14:59.940
Then I will delay you no further.

15:02.620 --> 15:07.659
We're gonna need everyone's help.
Colonel O'Neill is alive but in trouble.

15:07.576 --> 15:11.240
The data we've managed to gather
is all in the base computer.

15:11.215 --> 15:14.914
It's not much but it's all we have.
Use it.

15:14.894 --> 15:17.562
Don't rule anything out
or make assumptions.

15:17.571 --> 15:19.278
I'll lead the translation team.

15:19.330 --> 15:22.450
And we'll be working
out of the astrophysics lab.

15:22.807 --> 15:24.350
Any questions?

15:24.408 --> 15:28.488
- So we're dealing with a weapon.
- That's an assumption, Captain.

15:30.405 --> 15:32.445
All right, let's get to work.

15:35.763 --> 15:38.384
- How is he?
- He's developed an infection.

15:38.403 --> 15:42.529
I've given him antibiotics which,
amazingly, have slowed its progress.

15:42.479 --> 15:45.847
- Why is that amazing?
- I think you should see this.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.155
It's mobile, like a bacteria.

15:51.676 --> 15:54.961
But small, like a virus,
and slightly radioactive.

15:55.552 --> 15:58.837
Definitely alien.
And they also seem to bond in chains.

15:58.831 --> 16:01.287
<i>And it's infected the colonel.</i>

16:01.311 --> 16:03.350
This is why I wanted you to see it.

16:03.389 --> 16:06.722
I took this from the colonel's uniform
around his wound.

16:06.748 --> 16:09.664
It's infected his clothes
as well as living tissue?

16:09.667 --> 16:13.201
<i>It's metabolising the fibres
as if it was living tissue.</i>

16:13.184 --> 16:15.639
Like a form of necrotising fasciitis.

16:16.624 --> 16:18.663
Flesh-eating disease?

16:20.422 --> 16:23.338
<i>- Okay, you said slightly radioactive.
- Yep.</i>

16:23.620 --> 16:24.615
Lieutenant!

16:24.698 --> 16:29.076
We used ultraviolet when we tested
the iris's structural integrity.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.495
- Right.
- Yep.

16:36.014 --> 16:39.049
Uh... Let's get some UV units
in the gate room.

16:39.053 --> 16:40.879
Teal'c? Colonel?

16:40.932 --> 16:45.594
<i>It's gonna get a little dark in there
for a few seconds while we try something.</i>

17:05.601 --> 17:07.925
Bringing up the UV lights...

17:07.960 --> 17:09.038
...now.

17:14.315 --> 17:15.559
Oh, my God!

17:31.548 --> 17:34.548
This is an even bigger problem
than we thought.

17:34.547 --> 17:36.623
<i>Captain Carter?</i>

17:38.184 --> 17:40.223
What's happening to me?

17:52.698 --> 17:57.573
<i>This organism can eat through
virtually any substance. Even concrete.</i>

17:57.496 --> 17:59.785
This entire complex is made of concrete.

17:59.815 --> 18:03.729
Worse than that,
it's got a taste for the base wiring.

18:03.692 --> 18:08.567
<i>Which means it'll affect or rather infect
our computers and communications.</i>

18:08.490 --> 18:10.980
Then we need to kill it.
How do we do that?

18:11.009 --> 18:14.710
<i>We've sprayed around
the mainframe with a pesticide,...</i>

18:14.688 --> 18:16.809
...but it hasn't even slowed it down.

18:16.847 --> 18:18.970
What was that you just gave me?

18:19.006 --> 18:23.167
Tetracycline. It's kept the infection at bay
in Colonel O'Neill...

18:23.124 --> 18:27.536
...and it seems to work prophylactically.
But, sir, I'll need more...

18:27.480 --> 18:32.143
Absolutely not! A Wildfire directive
means nothing in or out. You know that.

18:32.078 --> 18:36.373
Sir, Simmons's infection is even more
far gone than Colonel O'Neill's.

18:36.317 --> 18:40.362
But he's allergic to tetracycline,
and the alternatives I have on base...

18:40.316 --> 18:42.439
Don't make me repeat myself, Doctor.

18:50.269 --> 18:54.101
With your permission, sir,
I'd better get back to the infirmary.

19:01.665 --> 19:04.239
- Captain...
- Sir?

19:04.263 --> 19:06.386
I need your honest assessment.

19:06.423 --> 19:07.965
Can we beat this?

19:08.021 --> 19:10.512
Like the colonel always says -
never give up.

19:13.779 --> 19:15.903
I'm not sure, sir.

19:17.377 --> 19:22.086
Maybe it's time to consider evacuating
personnel through the Stargate.

19:22.934 --> 19:25.141
I've thought of that, but to where?

19:25.174 --> 19:29.301
There's no guarantee that we can stop
the organism coming with us.

19:29.251 --> 19:32.252
We don't have the right
to infect another world.

19:32.250 --> 19:35.250
There are a number
of uninhabited worlds.

19:35.249 --> 19:38.534
Albeit most are uninhabited
for good reason.

19:38.527 --> 19:40.567
Even if we could evacuate,...

19:40.606 --> 19:44.853
...practically every one of us is now
infected by the organism to some degree.

19:44.805 --> 19:49.217
Without antibiotics we'd all be like
Lieutenant Simmons by now.

19:49.163 --> 19:52.032
The survivors would run out of supplies
in a few days.

19:52.041 --> 19:54.578
They'd have that much time
to find a solution.

19:54.599 --> 19:56.971
It's not worth the risk in my opinion.

19:57.038 --> 20:01.949
We don't know what the orb would do
if we tried to activate the Stargate again.

20:04.194 --> 20:07.480
Very well.
We'll make our stand right here, Captain.

20:07.913 --> 20:09.455
Yes, sir.

20:11.712 --> 20:14.119
It won't take us without a fight, sir.

20:16.789 --> 20:18.498
Damn right it won't.

20:37.059 --> 20:40.345
- Teal'c...
- I am here, O'Neill.

20:42.978 --> 20:46.346
- It's hot.
- The fever burns within you.

20:51.213 --> 20:52.163
You?

20:52.251 --> 20:54.825
The symbiote I carry
appears to protect me.

20:55.371 --> 20:57.410
Way to go, junior.

21:00.448 --> 21:02.487
Doctor Fraiser will find a cure.

21:11.683 --> 21:14.173
Teal'c, you don't have to stick around.

21:16.441 --> 21:19.442
Undomesticated equines
could not remove me.

21:22.076 --> 21:24.116
Wild horses, Teal'c.

21:24.278 --> 21:26.317
It's...

21:31.114 --> 21:32.904
That's a joke.

21:36.510 --> 21:38.549
You told a joke.

21:43.828 --> 21:46.284
Don't make me laugh, please.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.305
Very well.

21:53.542 --> 21:56.413
You're a good man, my friend.

21:57.461 --> 22:00.333
As are you,... my friend.

22:03.659 --> 22:05.153
<i>Sir!</i>

22:07.457 --> 22:10.208
I'm just about through here.

22:11.134 --> 22:13.708
<i>It's moving!</i>

22:14.614 --> 22:16.321
Teal'c...

22:16.374 --> 22:19.077
It will not allow us to free you, O'Neill.

22:23.489 --> 22:25.528
God... help...

22:43.319 --> 22:45.313
<i>All right.</i>

22:45.358 --> 22:50.104
If this is page one and this sequence of
numbers indicates exponential growth,...

22:50.036 --> 22:51.863
...what does that mean?

22:51.915 --> 22:55.663
It could represent
the growth pattern of the alien organism.

22:55.634 --> 22:58.634
So far its spread has followed
an exponential curve.

22:58.633 --> 23:02.333
All right. So from that
we can extrapolate that it's a warning.

23:02.310 --> 23:06.095
This organism will continue
to expand exponentially until...

23:06.068 --> 23:07.183
...what?

23:09.826 --> 23:11.866
Until we die?

23:12.625 --> 23:14.748
I mean, if that's what it says,...

23:15.704 --> 23:17.992
...what's the point of saying it?

23:18.022 --> 23:20.644
Try turning the page.
Maybe the answer's there.

23:22.461 --> 23:24.500
Right.

23:29.817 --> 23:31.976
Hey...

23:32.017 --> 23:34.057
How's the pain?

23:34.575 --> 23:37.362
<i>It's not too bad.</i>

23:39.012 --> 23:42.133
Well, I'm gonna give you
something for it anyway.

23:43.372 --> 23:44.829
Hey!

23:48.048 --> 23:50.087
If you see Captain Carter...

23:55.046 --> 23:57.085
Tell you what, Lieutenant,...

23:57.125 --> 24:00.243
...she has to come down soon
for her booster so...

24:00.243 --> 24:02.652
...I'll make sure I send her over.

24:13.477 --> 24:18.896
I was right. The staff blast gave
the organism energy it needed to spread.

24:18.795 --> 24:21.332
It's reproducing because we fed it.

24:21.354 --> 24:25.136
- Damn! Why did I let them do that?
- Okay, so it feeds on energy.

24:25.112 --> 24:27.519
How do we use that?
It feeds on everything.

24:27.549 --> 24:31.334
- Have the CO2 levels gone up?
- Yeah. The scrubbers are handling it.

24:31.307 --> 24:35.555
Like fire. Add energy and fuel,
it burns hotter and longer,...

24:35.506 --> 24:37.628
...but it can't live without one thing.

24:37.746 --> 24:39.537
- Oxygen.
- Yes!

24:39.585 --> 24:43.036
- We can't either.
- But at least we can slow it down.

24:45.942 --> 24:49.558
- What's happening?
- It's gotten into our computers.

24:49.539 --> 24:50.951
Keep working.

24:54.177 --> 24:56.218
<i>This way! This way!</i>

24:56.375 --> 25:00.208
You can't come this way, Captain.
It's eaten through a steam pipe.

25:21.444 --> 25:23.105
Hello!

25:23.163 --> 25:25.202
Somebody!

25:25.243 --> 25:27.282
- Somebody!
- Hello?

25:27.442 --> 25:28.721
Daniel!

25:28.800 --> 25:31.208
I'm stuck in here. Get the doors open.

25:39.836 --> 25:41.875
Hurry up!

25:43.555 --> 25:46.046
It's eating through the control panel.

25:49.632 --> 25:52.003
- Sam!
- I'm okay. I'll explain later.

26:00.945 --> 26:02.984
General, sir, I have something.

26:04.423 --> 26:06.001
<i>What is he doing?</i>

26:06.064 --> 26:09.099
Teal'c is trying to stop
the spread of the organism.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.343
- Tell him to stop.
- Why? It's working.

26:11.381 --> 26:14.880
Only because the fire is consuming
the oxygen in the room.

26:14.858 --> 26:17.314
It feeds on energy.

26:17.337 --> 26:19.128
Sir, I'm asking you to trust me.

26:21.734 --> 26:22.648
Teal'c!

26:23.815 --> 26:25.807
<i>Stand down.</i>

26:25.855 --> 26:27.931
We're going to try another approach.

26:31.891 --> 26:35.424
Okay. The organism
needs oxygen to reproduce.

26:35.409 --> 26:37.945
Since we're on internal life support,...

26:37.969 --> 26:40.804
...we can adjust the CO2
and lower the oxygen levels.

26:40.807 --> 26:42.384
How low are we talking?

26:42.447 --> 26:45.019
We'll start at 8%,
but we have to start now.

26:45.045 --> 26:47.084
- Do it.
- Yes, sir.

26:47.125 --> 26:49.615
General Hammond!
You should see this.

26:49.643 --> 26:52.215
<i>Auto self-destruct has been initiated.</i>

26:52.441 --> 26:56.688
I didn't touch it. The self-destruct
countdown just started on its own.

26:56.640 --> 26:57.753
General?

26:58.238 --> 27:02.152
In the event of containment failure,
Wildfire kicks in automatically.

27:02.797 --> 27:04.836
We have to stop the autodestruct.

27:04.875 --> 27:09.250
We have a duty to make sure the
organism does not leave the mountain.

27:09.193 --> 27:12.313
With all due respect, sir,
you don't understand.

27:12.311 --> 27:17.188
It can feed on a staff blast's energy.
How far do you think it will spread...

27:17.109 --> 27:19.148
...if the autodestruct goes off?

27:19.188 --> 27:21.061
I need two officers to override.

27:26.184 --> 27:30.728
The organism's invaded our computers.
It won't recognise our codes.

27:30.663 --> 27:34.874
The internal clock's been activated.
We can't stop it without the computer.

27:34.820 --> 27:40.406
Then the organism will be fed enough
energy to spread across the whole Earth.

27:53.052 --> 27:55.092
<i>I blew it.</i>

27:59.249 --> 28:01.288
I screwed up.

28:03.087 --> 28:06.087
I also believed
we should retrieve the object.

28:10.963 --> 28:13.003
It was my decision.

28:14.323 --> 28:18.865
If we are to meet the challenge
of the Goa'uld and further your race,...

28:19.839 --> 28:21.880
...risks must be taken.

28:24.397 --> 28:26.436
Your decision was correct.

28:32.834 --> 28:35.122
<i>Your idea seems to be working.</i>

28:35.152 --> 28:38.152
It slowed the progress
of the organism by almost 90%.

28:38.151 --> 28:41.816
Don't jump up and down now
or you'll get my other patients excited.

28:42.988 --> 28:47.614
In a completely anaerobic environment,
the organism just goes dormant.

28:47.546 --> 28:51.080
All we've done is buy ourselves
a little time before...

28:52.105 --> 28:54.144
I gotta get back to work.

28:54.182 --> 28:57.883
Before you do, would you stop by
to see Lieutenant Simmons?

28:58.342 --> 29:00.381
How's he doin'?

29:03.339 --> 29:05.378
Thanks.

29:14.374 --> 29:15.833
Graham?

29:19.371 --> 29:20.699
Captain Carter!

29:23.171 --> 29:26.586
We're fighting this thing.
You just gotta hang in there.

29:27.607 --> 29:29.646
Before I...

29:31.086 --> 29:33.125
I just wanted to say...

29:33.963 --> 29:36.003
...how much...

29:42.680 --> 29:44.720
How am I doin' so far?

29:46.239 --> 29:48.278
You're doin' just fine.

30:30.097 --> 30:31.592
Come here!

30:31.655 --> 30:34.740
<i>- Who?
- What? Anybody. Just... come here.</i>

30:35.974 --> 30:37.599
Look at this.

30:37.653 --> 30:38.933
Wait for it...

30:39.094 --> 30:41.002
There.

30:44.411 --> 30:47.244
- That symbol's on the artefact.
- Yes, it is.

30:48.970 --> 30:51.258
It's trying to communicate with us.

30:55.405 --> 31:01.490
What we thought was gibberish may be
the aliens' attempt to communicate.

31:01.364 --> 31:05.740
The symbols could also be from the
random files from our earlier research.

31:05.681 --> 31:09.548
No. I didn't start working on this
until after the computers went down.

31:09.519 --> 31:11.926
What might they be trying
to communicate?

31:11.959 --> 31:16.750
They could be saying, "Take me to your
leader", for all I know. I have no idea.

31:17.996 --> 31:20.035
<i>The point is that they're trying.</i>

31:20.074 --> 31:23.988
We haven't considered that we may be
up against an alien intelligence.

31:23.952 --> 31:29.076
We've treated it like a disease, a plague.
Not once have we stopped to listen.

31:28.990 --> 31:30.153
How do we do that?

31:31.589 --> 31:34.163
- We let it grow.
- What?

31:34.186 --> 31:38.979
We increase the oxygen levels.
We hit it with another staff weapon blast.

31:38.903 --> 31:41.359
We let it do what it's been trying to do.

31:41.384 --> 31:44.965
The opposite of the advice
you've been giving me up to now.

31:44.942 --> 31:46.981
Which is it, Captain?

31:47.020 --> 31:50.970
General, we both know what will happen
if we don't try something.

32:02.214 --> 32:04.705
The organism bonds together in chains.

32:04.731 --> 32:09.144
What if it can only express that
intelligence once it reaches critical mass?

32:09.050 --> 32:14.174
But even then it'll be communicating
in a language that I can't translate...

32:14.088 --> 32:15.914
...without a point of reference.

32:17.087 --> 32:19.838
Maybe Colonel O'Neill
didn't just get in the way.

32:19.846 --> 32:22.419
Dr. Fraiser said there was no blood.

32:22.444 --> 32:25.528
There is practically no trauma
around that wound.

32:25.523 --> 32:27.895
Yet that's just not possible.

32:27.921 --> 32:30.126
- Unless it did it on purpose.
- Yes!

32:30.161 --> 32:32.829
We have to cut off his medication, sir.

32:32.838 --> 32:35.045
Are you out of your mind?

32:35.078 --> 32:37.748
If you do so, O'Neill will die.

32:37.758 --> 32:39.584
He'd want us to try, I know it.

32:41.714 --> 32:44.420
Communicate with the organism
through Jack?

32:44.433 --> 32:48.762
Yes! I think that's what
it's been trying to do all along.

32:58.747 --> 33:01.319
<i>Oxygen levels now 30% above normal.</i>

33:05.263 --> 33:06.888
Sir?

33:08.303 --> 33:12.299
Sir, I don't know if what we're about to try
is a good idea or not.

33:12.340 --> 33:15.542
But you have a right to know.
You might not survive it.

33:32.372 --> 33:33.700
<i>Okay, Teal'c.</i>

33:43.846 --> 33:45.090
Again.

33:51.762 --> 33:53.763
We have to. Again.

34:05.316 --> 34:06.809
No pulse.

34:26.985 --> 34:29.938
<i>Good morning, campers.</i>

34:35.501 --> 34:37.541
This...

34:37.579 --> 34:40.579
...is truly a strange feeling.

34:41.498 --> 34:42.909
Colonel?

34:43.777 --> 34:47.027
Yes. He is here.

34:51.614 --> 34:53.652
Who else are we talking to?

34:54.692 --> 34:56.518
We...

34:56.572 --> 34:58.195
...are also here.

35:05.887 --> 35:07.925
- My name is...
- Hammond.

35:08.605 --> 35:10.644
Yes.

35:10.686 --> 35:12.677
O'Neill knows.

35:12.724 --> 35:16.637
Then you should also know
we mean you no harm.

35:18.599 --> 35:20.722
You awoke us.

35:23.039 --> 35:27.416
We have only recently
become aware of your existence.

35:28.197 --> 35:30.235
You would have returned us...

35:31.074 --> 35:33.068
...to our former world.

35:33.114 --> 35:36.778
- We believed you were a threat to us.
- We feared you.

35:36.751 --> 35:40.001
And your fear would have destroyed us.

35:43.509 --> 35:45.547
Millennia ago...

35:46.347 --> 35:48.387
...our world was dying.

35:48.826 --> 35:50.865
We could no longer...

35:51.905 --> 35:53.945
...live there.

35:55.422 --> 35:57.461
For this reason,...

35:57.503 --> 36:00.918
...we created the orb.

36:00.900 --> 36:03.141
Where you have slept for 100,000 years.

36:05.179 --> 36:06.722
Yes, Daniel.

36:06.777 --> 36:12.197
Waiting for someone to come along,
like us, and take you through the Stargate.

36:12.096 --> 36:15.380
So it was written on the orb.

36:16.213 --> 36:19.581
Once exposed to the atmosphere
of a living world,...

36:20.971 --> 36:22.762
...we went forth.

36:22.809 --> 36:24.516
And multiplied.

36:24.929 --> 36:26.637
So it was written.

36:26.688 --> 36:29.061
<i>Auto self-destruct in four minutes.</i>

36:29.567 --> 36:33.730
- We cannot go back.
- And we cannot allow you to stay.

36:36.324 --> 36:38.992
O'Neill feels this as well.

36:41.121 --> 36:43.161
However,...

36:43.199 --> 36:46.402
...you have allowed us no alternatives.

36:47.798 --> 36:50.335
General, we're almost out of time.

36:50.836 --> 36:53.956
This place,
admittedly out of our ignorance,...

36:53.954 --> 36:56.742
...is about to be destroyed by an explosion.

36:56.753 --> 36:59.541
Such energy only serves...

36:59.552 --> 37:01.960
...to nourish us.

37:01.990 --> 37:04.030
We will multiply...

37:04.630 --> 37:06.670
...and consume...

37:06.708 --> 37:08.666
...your world.

37:10.347 --> 37:13.965
If you would allow us
to restore our communications,...

37:13.945 --> 37:16.318
...we could stop that from happening.

37:16.344 --> 37:18.217
We would survive.

37:18.264 --> 37:20.304
O'Neill desires this...

37:21.222 --> 37:23.262
...as well.

37:23.661 --> 37:25.701
He wishes...

37:25.780 --> 37:27.820
...to live.

37:34.097 --> 37:36.135
But what of us?

37:39.773 --> 37:40.971
P4G-881!

37:43.452 --> 37:46.322
It's primordial.
Lots of oxygen and sunlight.

37:46.331 --> 37:48.820
Like this world was
a quarter of a billion years ago.

37:48.849 --> 37:51.601
We can't open the Stargate
without the computers.

37:52.806 --> 37:54.929
You would send us there?

37:56.445 --> 37:58.686
Through your Stargate?

37:58.724 --> 38:00.099
We would.

38:00.164 --> 38:03.746
- For what reason?
- So that we both may survive.

38:12.117 --> 38:16.280
We'll take you there ourselves!
Please!

38:20.355 --> 38:22.643
<i>Everything just shut down!</i>

38:30.150 --> 38:32.188
God help us.

38:34.467 --> 38:37.503
<i>Auto self-destruct in two minutes.</i>

38:37.507 --> 38:40.376
Sir, I think the computers are rebooting!

38:40.385 --> 38:44.547
Start dialling P4G-881
as soon as they're up!

38:44.503 --> 38:45.701
Yes, sir.

38:54.777 --> 38:57.398
<i>Auto self-destruct
in one minute 30 seconds.</i>

38:58.335 --> 38:59.664
Chevron one engaged.

39:06.012 --> 39:07.293
Chevron two engaged.

39:12.929 --> 39:14.969
Chevron three engaged.

39:18.447 --> 39:20.487
Chevron four engaged.

39:23.445 --> 39:26.278
<i>Auto self-destruct in one minute.</i>

39:26.284 --> 39:27.563
Chevron five engaged.

39:32.280 --> 39:33.478
Chevron six engaged.

39:40.275 --> 39:42.184
Chevron seven locked.

39:53.269 --> 39:55.476
<i>Auto self-destruct in 30 seconds.</i>

40:05.583 --> 40:07.244
<i>20 seconds.</i>

40:15.300 --> 40:16.498
<i>10,...</i>

40:16.579 --> 40:18.036
<i>.. 9,...</i>

40:20.657 --> 40:22.115
<i>.. 4, 3,...</i>

40:25.333 --> 40:26.876
Autodestruct is aborted.

40:26.934 --> 40:29.887
<i>Auto self-destruct aborted.</i>

40:45.005 --> 40:47.043
Nice work.

40:47.085 --> 40:50.001
It is good to see you
alive and well, O'Neill.

40:50.003 --> 40:53.916
- Welcome back, Jack.
- We thought you were gone for good, sir.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.039
Wild horses, Captain.
