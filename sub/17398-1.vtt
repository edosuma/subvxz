00:12.734 --> 00:15.413
Tonight, Richard Hammond
buys a cup of coffee.

00:15.414 --> 00:19.293
James May slips on some snow.
I hate snow.

00:19.294 --> 00:22.494
And we show a picture
of Steve McQueen.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.414
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:31.334 --> 00:35.933
Hello! Hello, everybody. We're back!

00:35.934 --> 00:40.613
Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:40.614 --> 00:46.093
It is a whole new series
featuring many things.

00:46.094 --> 00:52.053
We go to Las Vegas, Italy,
Monte Carlo, Albania,
Loughborough...

00:52.054 --> 00:53.573
LAUGHTER

00:53.574 --> 00:58.453
But we start tonight
with General Motors,
which is a big company in America.

00:58.454 --> 01:04.852
Many people say that last year they
stopped making the Hummer because
it was too big and too silly.

01:04.854 --> 01:12.534
However, Richard Hammond says
the reason it's gone west is because
it wasn't big or silly enough.

01:22.214 --> 01:24.613
This is one of the deceased Hummers.

01:24.614 --> 01:26.133
The H3.

01:26.134 --> 01:31.573
And it is, you'll notice,
a pretty sizable car.

01:31.574 --> 01:34.773
However, if you mourn its passing,

01:34.774 --> 01:39.094
don't worry because happily you can
now buy something a bit bigger.

01:44.054 --> 01:49.133
It's called the Marauder,
which is quite a scary sounding name.

01:49.134 --> 01:52.773
But, hey, Buttercup didn't feel
quite right so, hey, live with it.

01:52.774 --> 01:57.693
I can't imagine it ever having
one of those Christian fish symbols
on the back bumper.

01:57.694 --> 02:02.933
The Marauder, which is built in
South Africa, weighs ten tonnes.

02:02.934 --> 02:08.493
It's also 21 feet long
and 9 feet high.

02:08.494 --> 02:11.014
So in traffic
it does tend to stand out a bit.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.493
Ooh, don't people
get out of your way!

02:22.494 --> 02:24.014
Don't they!

02:25.574 --> 02:28.133
CHUCKLES
Yeah! Hmm...

02:28.134 --> 02:35.133
Tell you what, you do get some people
telling you about how they feel
a bit nervous in Johannesburg.

02:35.134 --> 02:36.654
I er... I don't, no! I don't.

02:39.694 --> 02:45.053
It's a weird feeling because
I'm both worried about bumping
into things because it's big,

02:45.054 --> 02:47.333
and NOT worried about
bumping into things

02:47.334 --> 02:49.374
because, well, frankly, who cares?

02:52.454 --> 02:59.373
Like the original Hummer, the
Marauder is a military-spec vehicle
that ordinary civilians can buy.

02:59.374 --> 03:01.733
All you have to do is
pass a background check

03:01.734 --> 03:06.573
to prove you're not a villain
living in a hollowed-out volcano,

03:06.574 --> 03:10.014
and come up with
a cheque for £300,000.

03:12.574 --> 03:14.933
That is Rolls Royce Phantom money,

03:14.934 --> 03:18.933
for a machine that's not exactly
the last word in luxury.

03:18.934 --> 03:21.653
Take the back seats, for instance.

03:21.654 --> 03:24.093
There are eight of them,
which is good,

03:24.094 --> 03:28.293
but I don't think you'll be
renting this out
as a wedding car any day soon.

03:28.294 --> 03:35.253
And as for the dashboard, they
clearly decided not to go for the
walnut and leather option on here,

03:35.254 --> 03:38.133
partly because they need to
leave room for the switches,

03:38.134 --> 03:41.254
partly because the wood might clash
with the machine guns.

03:43.214 --> 03:48.413
However, the Marauder
does compensate in other areas.

03:48.414 --> 03:52.733
Take this annoying slow traffic
that I'm stuck in now.

03:52.734 --> 03:58.093
Normally this is where you need
some expensive sat-nav system
to give you alternative routes.

03:58.094 --> 04:00.974
The Marauder doesn't need sat-nav.

04:08.494 --> 04:10.854
There you go. There you go.

04:13.054 --> 04:14.174
Oh, yeah!

04:15.734 --> 04:19.774
It really does control
its immense weight very well.

04:21.414 --> 04:22.654
Yes!

04:25.534 --> 04:29.934
It really is like offroading
quite a large building.

04:32.854 --> 04:34.094
Right, now...

04:38.174 --> 04:39.974
That gap's big enough.

04:44.014 --> 04:45.334
I-It is now.

04:51.614 --> 04:52.854
Oh, Lord!

04:56.054 --> 04:59.574
ALARM WAILS

05:02.534 --> 05:04.294
This is a good town car.

05:11.454 --> 05:16.214
In fact, the Marauder has several
benefits as a city runabout.

05:18.414 --> 05:23.254
Imagine, for example, that you nip
off to get a coffee and this happens.

05:26.654 --> 05:31.133
Oh! That's not nice, no.

05:31.134 --> 05:36.693
Now, normally the towaway people
leave you powerless and penniless,

05:36.694 --> 05:38.493
but not this time.

05:38.494 --> 05:42.293
The Marauder has got
290 brake horsepower

05:42.294 --> 05:46.133
and a top speed of just 70 mph,
which admittedly isn't brilliant.

05:46.134 --> 05:49.613
However, the torque figure
is astonishing...

05:49.614 --> 05:53.933
1,100 Newton metres of it,
which is... a lot.

05:53.934 --> 05:57.774
And that makes it pretty good
in a towaway tug-of-war.

06:07.494 --> 06:09.174
We're going this way.

06:15.814 --> 06:17.774
Yes, there you go.

06:18.814 --> 06:20.453
Another everyday irritation,

06:20.454 --> 06:23.653
popping into the supermarket

06:23.654 --> 06:27.653
and coming out
to find yourself blocked in. Again,

06:27.654 --> 06:32.053
no problem for the Marauder, thanks
to its vertical climbing system.

06:32.054 --> 06:36.893
Low range, four-wheel drive,
div lock,

06:36.894 --> 06:39.654
drive, handbrake off.

07:09.374 --> 07:13.014
It's really kind of
the ideal shopping car.

07:15.494 --> 07:20.853
But let's not get carried away
because, like everything,

07:20.854 --> 07:23.093
the Marauder has its weak points.

07:23.094 --> 07:26.173
Visiting a drive-through,
for example.

07:26.174 --> 07:29.613
Normally at about this point
you'd roll down the windows

07:29.614 --> 07:32.733
and get ready to say,
"Cheeseburger and chips, please."

07:32.734 --> 07:37.453
But the problem is the Marauder's
windows are for tough situations,

07:37.454 --> 07:42.013
they're 90 mm thick.
They can shrug off an RPG

07:42.014 --> 07:45.814
and as a result you can't open them,
so this is where
it gets a bit awkward.

07:50.654 --> 07:53.053
Good morning,
can I take your order please?

07:53.054 --> 07:54.693
Hello? If you're there...

07:54.694 --> 07:58.613
BOOMS OVER LOUDSPEAKER: ..I'd like a
cheeseburger and some chips, please.

07:58.614 --> 08:01.173
This isn't a riot situation,
don't be alarmed.

08:01.174 --> 08:07.294
But the real problem comes when you
drive around to collect your order.

08:08.734 --> 08:10.134
Right.

08:12.374 --> 08:14.174
Don't be alarmed, I'm not shooting.

08:21.374 --> 08:24.053
So, a mark against
the Marauder there.

08:24.054 --> 08:29.133
And if you happen to
visit a safari park...

08:29.134 --> 08:33.813
you might find that the windscreen
wipers aren't that tough.

08:35.414 --> 08:39.294
But is this the only weak spot?
Let's see.

08:41.894 --> 08:46.933
Now, this is where we're going to
do a little test you won't find

08:46.934 --> 08:52.373
in the NCAP ratings, and we start
not with this but with that.

08:52.374 --> 08:54.534
Our old friend, the Hummer...

08:57.614 --> 09:02.734
whose underside was packed with
seven pounds of plastic explosive.

09:04.894 --> 09:06.293
Oh, dear.

09:06.294 --> 09:12.053
Really not much point trying to
see if it'll start because some
pretty important bits are missing.

09:12.054 --> 09:17.813
So the H3 is, like Hummer itself,
very dead.

09:17.814 --> 09:21.693
But the important question is
what happens to the Marauder

09:21.694 --> 09:25.614
when you put the same amount
of explosives underneath it?

09:45.294 --> 09:48.173
Right, well, clearly, what has
happened here is there was a fight

09:48.174 --> 09:53.893
between the Marauder and the earth,
and the earth lost and the explosives
have just dug a big hole.

09:53.894 --> 09:58.813
The question is,
can it still be driven?

09:58.814 --> 10:02.373
OK, fingers crossed.

10:02.374 --> 10:04.493
ENGINE STRUGGLES

10:04.494 --> 10:05.533
ENGINE STARTS

10:05.534 --> 10:07.053
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

10:07.054 --> 10:12.054
That was definitely an inconvenience
but really nothing more.

10:22.414 --> 10:23.934
Oh, yeah.

10:27.654 --> 10:28.734
APPLAUSE

10:34.334 --> 10:36.173
Good car.

10:36.174 --> 10:38.814
It was great.

10:40.574 --> 10:43.493
Useful bit of consumer advice there.

10:43.494 --> 10:46.013
Can I just say, though,
I was looking carefully.

10:46.014 --> 10:52.173
The last little bit there as it came
out of the hole, I noticed the rear
tyre had been blown off the rim.

10:52.174 --> 10:55.813
Seven pounds of plastic explosive and
all it did was below the tyre off.

10:55.814 --> 11:00.693
But a car with the tyre blown off
is as useless as a car that has
been blown to smithereens, really.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.733
Well, no, seven pounds...
He's right because it's like saying,

11:03.734 --> 11:06.533
"My watch survived the explosion
completely unscathed.

11:06.534 --> 11:08.814
"The hour hand has come off,
but apart from that..."

11:08.815 --> 11:12.733
It's like saying, "I survived
the explosion apart from my head,
which is over there."

11:12.734 --> 11:16.093
Would you two please
just stop saying things?

11:16.094 --> 11:18.973
I think it's an excellent car,
and now the news.

11:18.974 --> 11:22.733
Yes, news. Yes, it's the news. For
people who think there's literally

11:22.734 --> 11:29.653
too much room in the back of a
standard Mini, don't worry because
there's now a coupe. There it is.

11:29.654 --> 11:32.893
Whoa-ho-ho!

11:32.894 --> 11:38.373
Any details? I can tell you it's, er...
It's between £18,000 and £24,000

11:38.374 --> 11:41.973
and the top model
has 208 horsepower.

11:41.974 --> 11:44.853
A lot of people have been talking
about its roof, unsurprisingly.

11:44.854 --> 11:52.013
Mini themselves say it's styled
to look like a baseball cap
being worn backwards.

11:52.014 --> 11:53.494
Why would I want that as my roof?

11:53.495 --> 11:56.773
I think this is a car
that, probably, at night
when you leave it,

11:56.774 --> 11:59.254
entertains itself by
spitting at the elderly.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.093
They should have called it the Lout.
The Slob.

12:04.094 --> 12:07.093
Steal its own wheels
and put itself on bricks.

12:07.094 --> 12:11.173
I like the idea of the Slob. Now,
hey, you know when you're pregnant?

12:11.174 --> 12:15.334
Er, no. No.
Yours is coming on nicely.

12:16.854 --> 12:19.973
And you go for a scan and
they're able to tell the sex? Yes.

12:19.974 --> 12:23.893
Well a very kind lady has sent us a
photograph of a scan she's had done

12:23.894 --> 12:31.293
of her forthcoming arrival,
and it seems to suggest she's
giving birth to a Stig. Look here.

12:31.294 --> 12:35.053
She is! Oh, look!

12:35.054 --> 12:37.693
All curled up, that's nice.

12:37.694 --> 12:42.093
We're worried about this because
we've told him time and again
to stop impregnating people.

12:42.094 --> 12:46.813
It's awkward. He made Michael Gambon
pregnant twice.

12:46.814 --> 12:51.213
If there's any consolation,
it'll probably be a fairly
quick birth, I imagine.

12:51.214 --> 12:54.053
Unless it comes out sideways,
like that.

12:54.054 --> 12:58.333
Good news! Actually, it's not
good news, it's just some news, OK?

12:58.334 --> 13:01.293
MG is back.
This is the new car, here he is.

13:01.294 --> 13:06.093
It's called the MG 6, you can have
it as a saloon or as a hatchback.

13:06.094 --> 13:09.013
It's supposed to be very modern
in every way but I don't think

13:09.014 --> 13:15.093
the factory where it's being made in
Longbridge is modern at all because
I've got the press release

13:15.094 --> 13:21.653
they sent out here and it says the
first car was driven off the line
by the only woman who works there.

13:21.654 --> 13:24.773
That's not very modern, is it? No.
Did they go on to say,

13:24.774 --> 13:27.493
"And best of all she has a
smashing pair of knockers!"?

13:27.494 --> 13:28.853
Very modern.

13:28.854 --> 13:32.053
Don't tell me. It says next,
"Don't worry, chaps, we'll let her

13:32.054 --> 13:36.733
"drive it off but we won't let her
park it." Oh, God! Welcome to 1950!

13:36.734 --> 13:41.214
The thing is, the car has gone away
for some reason. That's not a joke.

13:42.894 --> 13:48.613
The thing about this is, OK,
we know this is made in China

13:48.614 --> 13:51.813
by the lin-king wan-king
don-king non-king...

13:51.814 --> 13:56.893
Them. Yeah. Them. Keep going.

13:56.894 --> 13:59.493
Heavy corporation
industry, right, OK?

13:59.494 --> 14:03.933
It's shipped over to Birmingham,
where they fix an MG
badge on it and sell it.

14:03.934 --> 14:06.653
But they say in the actual
brochure, which I've got here,

14:06.654 --> 14:09.813
it talks about Le Mans
and breaking land speed records.

14:09.814 --> 14:13.493
It says the MG embodies
British sporting style.

14:13.494 --> 14:15.973
It doesn't. No, it doesn't.

14:15.974 --> 14:20.093
I think the only British sportiness
in that is the glue they use

14:20.094 --> 14:24.973
to fix on the badge is made
from a dead British racehorse.

14:24.974 --> 14:28.453
That's the only sporty
thing in that car, I reckon.

14:28.454 --> 14:32.373
Wait a minute.
I should add, the press release
they sent us has got a typo on it.

14:32.374 --> 14:36.213
Here it is, look. "Ear"?

14:36.214 --> 14:40.573
MG ear. I think this indicates
the car will be a bit hit.

14:40.574 --> 14:44.453
It might be complete rap.

14:44.454 --> 14:46.013
Absolute ollocks!

14:46.014 --> 14:48.533
Yes.

14:48.534 --> 14:52.173
Now, I've always wondered, I've
always thought there was someone

14:52.174 --> 14:56.573
in Britain now driving
around in, let's just say,
a Renault Fuego Turbo. OK?

14:56.574 --> 15:02.733
How do they know that's
not the last Renault Fuego Turbo
in the whole country?

15:02.734 --> 15:07.053
Well now there's a website
called howmanyleft.co.uk,

15:07.054 --> 15:11.293
where you can go on it and find out
precisely how many examples

15:11.294 --> 15:14.453
of each model are left
in existence, OK?

15:14.454 --> 15:16.253
It's unbelievable.

15:16.254 --> 15:19.533
So how many Fuego Turbos are there?
I went on it, there were three.

15:19.534 --> 15:22.013
Just three?
There were only three Fuego Turbos.

15:22.014 --> 15:26.293
That makes them really special.
It's an incredibly rare car.

15:26.294 --> 15:31.813
No, I went on it, and did you know -
because somebody doesn't - there's
somebody driving around

15:31.814 --> 15:39.453
in an Austin Maxi 1750 automatic
and probably doesn't realise
it's the last one?

15:39.454 --> 15:43.093
Only one Maxi 1750... One.
He's not here, are you?

15:43.094 --> 15:48.413
It's a Maxi 1750 automatic and it's
unique. Still crap though, isn't it?

15:48.414 --> 15:51.213
It's terrible. It's uniquely crap
because there's only one.

15:51.214 --> 15:56.893
Whenever we're told
there's one Amazonian
green-backed nose turtle left...

15:56.894 --> 16:00.133
God, is there? We're all supposed
to have these candlelit vigils

16:00.134 --> 16:06.013
and eat mud and not drive cars
and turn our central heating down to
save it because it's going extinct.

16:06.014 --> 16:11.133
There's only one Vauxhall Chevette
GL automatic left, that's it.

16:11.134 --> 16:13.413
There's only one left. Look at it!

16:13.414 --> 16:16.493
What's being done to save this car?

16:16.494 --> 16:20.213
I put it to you,
nothing is being done.

16:20.214 --> 16:25.373
Actually, in the Victorian era,
chaps used to go off, when something
was about to become extinct,

16:25.374 --> 16:29.693
they would go off, find it
and shoot it as a trophy.

16:29.694 --> 16:34.533
"The very last one, blam! Ha-ha!"
And then nail its head to the wall.

16:34.534 --> 16:37.293
Are you suggesting
then we go out and hunt?

16:37.294 --> 16:41.333
Yes, nail its head to our wall in
here. The last Chevette, like that.

16:41.334 --> 16:45.093
We've just thought of something to
do in programme six of this show.

16:45.094 --> 16:50.533
We're going hunting the Chevette
GL automatic. It's out there.

16:50.534 --> 16:54.973
Moving on, there was a poll recently
to find the most important car

16:54.974 --> 16:59.573
from the 20th century,
and I went for the Golf GTi

16:59.574 --> 17:04.373
because it was fast
and practical, and classless.

17:04.374 --> 17:09.653
And it's been much the same story
with all the models that have
come along subsequently.

17:09.654 --> 17:15.693
But none of them have ever
managed to capture, somehow,
the magic of the original.

17:15.694 --> 17:17.374
Until now.

17:23.773 --> 17:29.453
Now, I'll admit
it's not actually a GTi

17:29.454 --> 17:31.133
or a Golf,

17:31.134 --> 17:32.454
or even a Volkswagen.

17:33.534 --> 17:38.574
What it is a BMW - the new 1M.

17:42.094 --> 17:48.813
What BMW has done to create this
is take a standard one-series
and pump it up a bit.

17:48.814 --> 17:56.014
The wheel arches are flared, the car
is slightly lowered, and, at the
back, there are extra pooh chutes.

17:57.974 --> 18:02.693
Inside, there's a splash of suede on
the dash with some orange stitching.

18:02.694 --> 18:06.053
Otherwise, it's humdrum, normal.

18:06.054 --> 18:07.654
Not showy at all.

18:10.974 --> 18:15.614
Apart from the orange paint,
you simply wouldn't guess
that it can do this.

18:21.214 --> 18:26.694
Whoo! Whoo, yes!
Blimey, this is good.

18:29.934 --> 18:32.213
So what have we got here?

18:32.214 --> 18:36.213
Well, there's a straight-six
engine at the front,

18:36.214 --> 18:40.853
a manual gearbox in the middle,
and drive goes to the back.

18:40.854 --> 18:46.974
That's page one, chapter one
from the petrosexual handbook.

18:52.974 --> 18:57.254
It just feels so...
beautifully balanced.

18:59.694 --> 19:04.413
Of course, all BMW M cars
feel this way, they just feel

19:04.414 --> 19:09.493
better than Mercs,
better than Audis,
better than pretty much anything.

19:09.494 --> 19:14.773
And just when you think it can't
possibly get any better than this,

19:14.774 --> 19:18.174
you push the little
M button on the steering wheel...

19:19.934 --> 19:21.813
and the whole car shimmies.

19:21.814 --> 19:24.173
It's like a shiver of excitement.

19:24.174 --> 19:31.694
The feeling you get if someone
suddenly gave you permission to set
fire to Piers Morgan. Ooh, yes! Ooh!

19:34.734 --> 19:38.414
In M mode, it's even more
of a tyre-smoking mentalist.

19:45.774 --> 19:48.613
Honestly, I haven't driven anything

19:48.614 --> 19:51.293
this sort of perfect since...

19:51.294 --> 19:54.574
I don't know, since the original
Golf GTi, in fact.

19:58.894 --> 20:05.973
And what makes that quite surprising
is that the 1M is like a turkey
curry on Boxing Day.

20:05.974 --> 20:08.694
It's made from leftovers.

20:10.534 --> 20:13.213
The door mirrors
are from the current M3,

20:13.214 --> 20:16.853
the rear axle is from the old one,

20:16.854 --> 20:19.453
the engine is from a Z4.

20:19.454 --> 20:22.933
It's a recipe that shouldn't work,
but it does.

20:22.934 --> 20:24.934
As we shall now see.

20:27.254 --> 20:34.813
What we have here is a new, lighter,
more powerful Porsche, the Cayman R.

20:34.814 --> 20:40.013
And this is the new supercharged
Lotus Evora S.

20:40.014 --> 20:43.893
Both these no-compromise
ground-huggers are purpose-built

20:43.894 --> 20:49.773
to go like hell, so they should
cream the sit-up-and-beg Beemer.

20:49.774 --> 20:54.693
However, while the three-litre
engine in this is from a Z4,

20:54.694 --> 20:59.734
it's boosted to 340 horsepower
with two tiny little turbochargers.

21:06.734 --> 21:10.214
So, let's see how we get on.

21:21.174 --> 21:26.133
So, £50,000 Porsche, £60,000 Lotus,

21:26.134 --> 21:33.134
and the £40,000 BMW is showing them
its many pooh chutes! Ho-ho-ho!

21:39.014 --> 21:41.934
A bit depressing if
you've just bought a Lotus.

21:44.254 --> 21:46.693
And there's more.

21:46.694 --> 21:53.333
The Porsche and the Lotus are
effectively two-seaters and there's
hardly any luggage space at all.

21:53.334 --> 21:56.173
You get the speed at a price.

21:56.174 --> 22:00.293
But there's no price to
pay with the 1M.

22:00.294 --> 22:06.493
There's space in the back
for two children,
and room in the boot for two more.

22:06.494 --> 22:08.694
It's a family saloon.

22:11.494 --> 22:19.053
This, then, does to today's sports
cars what the original Golf GTi did
to the MG and the Triumph Spitfire.

22:19.054 --> 22:22.534
It renders them... pointless.

22:24.694 --> 22:26.934
Drawbacks?

22:28.254 --> 22:30.893
Pfff, erm...

22:30.894 --> 22:37.533
Maybe the sat-nav screen is a bit
far away, and perhaps the ride

22:37.534 --> 22:44.373
is a tad firm, but that said
it's not as uncomfortable
as my AMG Mercedes.

22:44.374 --> 22:49.293
Actually, falling down a
flight of stairs isn't as
uncomfortable as my Mercedes.

22:49.294 --> 22:53.694
Sustained machine-gun fire
would be better than
popping to the shops in that.

22:55.454 --> 22:59.733
And anyway, you won't really
notice the stiff suspension,
partly because the seats

22:59.734 --> 23:06.454
are so comfortable
and partly because you'll
be having such a good time.

23:09.534 --> 23:14.254
This is a brilliant,
brilliant, brilliant car,

23:16.254 --> 23:20.214
and that's all, really,
I've got to say. The end.

23:33.974 --> 23:36.094
Unbelievably good.

23:38.934 --> 23:42.613
It's one of the most spectacular
cars I've driven in a long time.

23:42.614 --> 23:46.133
Fair enough, but hang on,
hang on, hang on!

23:46.134 --> 23:49.013
£40,000 for a one-series!

23:49.014 --> 23:51.893
I'm sorry, were you not listening?

23:51.894 --> 23:55.653
I just said it's a brilliant
car and that was the end.
There was nothing more to say.

23:55.654 --> 23:58.893
Yes, but that's a big price tag.
There's nothing more to say.

23:58.894 --> 24:02.133
But there's something more to do.
We have to find out how fast it goes

24:02.134 --> 24:06.413
round our track and that of course
means handing it over to our
tame racing driver.

24:06.414 --> 24:10.573
Some say he doesn't know what
dogs are for, and that he recently

24:10.574 --> 24:14.853
took out a super-injunction to
prevent us from revealing that he...

24:14.854 --> 24:19.653
SILENCE

24:19.654 --> 24:21.774
..with an enormous goat.

24:23.974 --> 24:26.334
All we know is he's called The Stig.

24:28.694 --> 24:31.933
And he's off.
Wipers on, it's drizzling out there.

24:31.934 --> 24:34.293
Hopefully that won't
hurt the time too badly.

24:34.294 --> 24:37.693
Let's see, coming up
to the first corner.

24:37.694 --> 24:40.413
Very tidy on the way in,

24:40.414 --> 24:43.693
tidy through the middle,
tail out, there it is.

24:43.694 --> 24:46.693
The limited slip diff
allowing him perfect control.

24:46.694 --> 24:49.453
♪ Ro-mah, rom-ma-ma

24:49.454 --> 24:50.694
♪ Gaga, ooh la... ♪

24:50.695 --> 24:55.453
For some reason the Stig is
listening to Lady Gaga in French.

24:55.454 --> 24:59.613
Weird. OK, tidy through Chicago now,
down to Hammerhead.

24:59.614 --> 25:02.133
I have a sneaking suspicion
BMW have tried to

25:02.134 --> 25:06.373
make this car slow so it doesn't go
faster than the more expensive M3.

25:06.374 --> 25:09.293
Look at that,
tail really out there.

25:09.294 --> 25:12.254
Stig looking where he's
going out of the side windows.

25:16.054 --> 25:18.933
OK, follow-through.

25:18.934 --> 25:21.173
He's even sideways through that.

25:21.174 --> 25:26.853
BMW only bringing 450 1Ms to
Britain, 300 of them already sold.

25:26.854 --> 25:32.933
OK, hard on the brakes, penultimate
corner, still very greasy out there.

25:32.934 --> 25:36.134
Into Gambon and there he is
across the line.

25:37.934 --> 25:41.493
I have the time here.

25:41.494 --> 25:45.213
It did it in 1 minute 25 dead

25:45.214 --> 25:50.093
so, even though it was a damp track,
it was faster than an M3.

25:50.094 --> 25:55.093
Very good, but hang on, because I
think there was a bit of film there
we didn't see. No, there wasn't.

25:55.094 --> 25:59.573
There was, from the final run.
I think the audience would like
to see it. No, they wouldn't.

25:59.574 --> 26:02.133
Yes, they would. Let's have a look.

26:02.134 --> 26:04.573
There he is, you see,
just past the tyres.

26:04.574 --> 26:08.333
He's doing about 115 mph and,
oh, look, it's spat him off!

26:08.334 --> 26:11.213
But even on the wet grass
it's still in shape.

26:11.214 --> 26:14.813
No, that's just how good
The Stig is, not the car, you fool.

26:14.814 --> 26:18.093
It spat him off.
AUDIENCE: Oooh!

26:18.094 --> 26:22.414
Big price, small car,
big price, fell off.

26:24.494 --> 26:26.613
LAUGHTER

26:26.614 --> 26:29.973
Now time to put a star in
our reasonably priced car.

26:29.974 --> 26:32.693
My guest tonight was
christened Vincent

26:32.694 --> 26:40.373
but then he became a rock star
and decided he needed a rock-starry
name so he changed it to Alice.

26:40.374 --> 26:44.854
Ladies and gentlemen, we're not
worthy. Please welcome Alice Cooper!

26:49.734 --> 26:52.093
I can hardly believe you're here.

26:52.094 --> 26:54.773
Alice Cooper!

26:54.774 --> 26:58.094
A legend. Have a seat.

27:00.094 --> 27:01.453
Thank you.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.013
Why is it Alice?

27:03.014 --> 27:05.733
Why Alice? You know,

27:05.734 --> 27:10.093
you had to come up with a name
that was going to piss off
every parent in America.

27:10.094 --> 27:16.453
It translated across the ocean so,
you know, and Mary Whitehouse just
hated us. Because you were banned.

27:16.454 --> 27:20.853
Oh yes, she banned us for no apparent
reason but it was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

27:20.854 --> 27:25.213
School's Out came out, we went
right to number one, sold out...

27:25.214 --> 27:29.933
Because the British public said,
"How dare you tell us what we
can see and what we can't see!"

27:29.934 --> 27:34.773
So the British public was all for us
but there was the one lady
and we sent her flowers...

27:34.774 --> 27:40.173
Mary Whitehouse - in essence,
she was the Daily Mail but
in a pearl necklace really.

27:40.174 --> 27:41.933
She was a terrifying woman.

27:41.934 --> 27:45.093
It was the stage shows, I think,
that made everybody say,

27:45.094 --> 27:47.893
"Hang on a minute,
why are these people coming here?"

27:47.894 --> 27:52.053
There was the story, which
I don't believe is true,
that you ripped a chicken in half.

27:52.054 --> 27:56.013
No, that was Colonel Sanders.
Made a chicken die anyway.

27:56.014 --> 27:58.973
Somebody threw a chicken on stage
in the middle of a concert.

27:58.974 --> 28:04.373
I'm from Detroit, I've never been on
a farm in my life, so I picked it up.

28:04.374 --> 28:06.814
It had feathers,
it was a bird, it should fly.

28:10.694 --> 28:14.293
I threw it and it didn't fly
as much as it plummeted

28:14.294 --> 28:17.693
into the audience,
and the audience tore it to pieces.

28:17.694 --> 28:22.533
Then the next day
it was "Alice Cooper rips
a chicken apart and eats it."

28:22.534 --> 28:27.773
Because in your shows,
you often got decapitated, hung.

28:27.774 --> 28:31.893
I got killed four times in my
last show, but I play the villain.

28:31.894 --> 28:34.893
I always play the villain, so
the villain has to get it in the end.

28:34.894 --> 28:37.893
The Darth Vader, the Hannibal Lecter,
always has to get it in the end.

28:37.894 --> 28:40.134
So when's the next time
we can see you in the UK?

28:40.135 --> 28:44.493
We'll be here in Halloween, of course
because I own Halloween, it's mine.

28:44.494 --> 28:48.013
It is. The Prince of Darkness. We're
doing a big show at the Ally Pally.

28:48.014 --> 28:50.414
I think it's kind of interesting,
Alice at the Palace.

28:50.415 --> 28:52.533
Will you be killed many times?

28:52.534 --> 28:56.533
Just once in this show, one good one.

28:56.534 --> 28:59.533
Although you've been killed many
times, obviously on stage,

28:59.534 --> 29:05.733
you didn't die in the '60s and '70s
when so many of your
contemporaries did.

29:05.734 --> 29:11.093
Yeah, well my big brothers were Keith
Moon, Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix.

29:11.094 --> 29:13.653
I can go right down the list
of everyone that died

29:13.654 --> 29:17.853
at 27 years old, and I was the little
brother trying to keep up with them.

29:17.854 --> 29:22.773
It almost got me.
Who was the biggest?
Nobody can compete with Keith Moon.

29:22.774 --> 29:25.813
I've heard this many times,
that Keith Moon was the maddest.

29:25.814 --> 29:28.653
If you think of it this way,
about 40% of what you've heard

29:28.654 --> 29:33.053
about me or Iggy or Ozzy or anything
like that is probably true.

29:33.054 --> 29:36.333
Everything you've ever heard about
Keith Moon is true.

29:36.334 --> 29:40.213
LAUGHTER
And you've only heard a tenth of it.

29:40.214 --> 29:44.053
He'd come to Los Angeles and stay
at the house for a week, you know.

29:44.054 --> 29:50.053
And I'd go out to a recording
session, come back and he'd be
dressed like a French maid.

29:50.054 --> 29:53.173
And your car was in
the swimming pool.

29:53.174 --> 29:56.093
And my wife would go, "Who is this?!"

29:56.094 --> 30:00.053
How did you manage to survive,
then, when obviously
so many people didn't?

30:00.054 --> 30:05.773
I woke up one morning, and instead of
just throwing up beer, it was blood.

30:05.774 --> 30:09.813
But real blood. I mean, not...?
Yeah, it wasn't fake blood.

30:09.814 --> 30:16.613
You know, throwing up blood
on stage is very theatrical
and it looks great.

30:16.614 --> 30:19.893
In your Holiday Inn room, you know,

30:19.894 --> 30:21.973
where the only person
who can see is the maid

30:21.974 --> 30:25.613
and she's really not impressed
because she has to clean it up,

30:25.614 --> 30:28.493
that was a good message for me
that this is really it now.

30:28.494 --> 30:32.813
If I keep drinking, I'm going to die.
So what did you replace it with?

30:32.814 --> 30:34.334
Golf.

30:36.214 --> 30:39.214
That would clear Keith Moon up.
Golf and cannibalism.

30:40.854 --> 30:43.773
I don't want to talk about golf.

30:43.774 --> 30:47.733
I want to talk about Detroit,
which is where you're from. Yep.

30:47.734 --> 30:54.613
A lot of people think of it as
the music town, obviously Motown and
the Motown acts, but the amount of

30:54.614 --> 30:58.373
rock-and-roll stars that have
come out of Detroit
is simply unbelievable.

30:58.374 --> 31:03.613
Iggy Pop, Ted Nugent,
Bob Seeger, Madonna is Detroit,
which a lot of people don't realise.

31:03.614 --> 31:04.854
The MC5. White Stripes.

31:04.855 --> 31:08.893
Bits of the Eagles, everyone
thinks they're from California.
They're Detroit.

31:08.894 --> 31:13.493
Detroit, yes.
Behind this music, which was huge,

31:13.494 --> 31:19.973
obviously cars were also big
and there's no question, you're a
big car freak. Massive petrolhead.

31:19.974 --> 31:24.213
Yes, I love cars. And they
give me a Kia to drive!

31:24.214 --> 31:27.893
Yes, we do. Down-to-earth, it's the
star in the REASONABLY priced car.

31:27.894 --> 31:33.373
How many cars do you think you've
owned over the years? At least 100.

31:33.374 --> 31:36.933
I'm assuming most of your cars
you've had over the years,

31:36.934 --> 31:39.413
I guess are American.
Would that be the case?

31:39.414 --> 31:42.493
Yeah, well, we were always addicted
to the Mustangs and Camaros.

31:42.494 --> 31:44.173
Detroit.

31:44.174 --> 31:49.373
Yeah, the Detroit muscle cars. And
you know, of course the Hemi Cudas.

31:49.374 --> 31:52.973
What's the Alice Cooper Corral
that you read about all the time?

31:52.974 --> 31:58.693
I'm so into the cars and in Phoenix,
Arizona, where I live, we build cars
and then... This is the Corral.

31:58.694 --> 32:02.133
Yeah. Then we put my name on it
and I go and help sell it.

32:02.134 --> 32:03.973
So we have a picture of...

32:03.974 --> 32:06.973
That was a Lincoln Zephyr.

32:06.974 --> 32:10.773
That's billion-dollar
bills burning up the flames

32:10.774 --> 32:13.973
and we said, "Who would buy a car,
the billion dollar babies car?"

32:13.974 --> 32:16.333
We said, well, Trump, maybe?

32:16.334 --> 32:18.693
What would make it

32:18.694 --> 32:20.293
really appealing to them?

32:20.294 --> 32:23.813
You open the trunk in this car and
there's your own private ATM machine.

32:23.814 --> 32:28.013
Oh really?
Yes, your own bank money machine.

32:28.014 --> 32:31.893
A cash machine in the trunk.
Yeah! You open it up and...

32:31.894 --> 32:35.973
So when you're touring,
are you looking for
these unusual cars to buy?

32:35.974 --> 32:42.013
I just found a really nice
little '65 Mustang that
looks like it came out of

32:42.014 --> 32:45.053
the shop in Nashville. I drove by
it every day going to the studio

32:45.054 --> 32:50.213
and I finally went in and said
"What do you want for this car?"
They said 22,000.

32:50.214 --> 32:52.533
Because that's cheap. Absolutely.

32:52.534 --> 32:57.453
You didn't have the heart to say,
"You do realise cars like that
are worth a lot more these days"?

32:57.454 --> 33:00.693
I didn't tell them.
LAUGHTER

33:00.694 --> 33:04.653
OK, so, anyway, you came over here
to try your hand at a lap

33:04.654 --> 33:09.013
and I guess a lap is quite unusual
with corners for an American.

33:09.014 --> 33:13.093
Yeah. No, you're really right
because in America we drag race.

33:13.094 --> 33:16.533
We go from light to light.
You pull up next to a car.

33:16.534 --> 33:18.493
This is the sign, this means race.

33:18.494 --> 33:25.093
Really? You go, OK, you rev it up,
put it in first gear and whoever gets
to that light next is the winner.

33:25.094 --> 33:30.293
But you burn rubber up,
it's just drag racing so you
don't even think about turning.

33:30.294 --> 33:34.013
But this was interesting
for me to get in a car,

33:34.014 --> 33:35.653
the shift on the left side.

33:35.654 --> 33:38.293
It was like dyslexic driving

33:38.294 --> 33:42.893
because I'm going 3rd, 9th? Opening
the door, no, it's not there.

33:42.894 --> 33:47.054
So they gave me an automatic and
it was a really, really fast Kia!

33:50.414 --> 33:54.054
Who would like to see
Alice's lap? Yeah.

33:55.774 --> 33:59.653
Here we go. Let's have a look.

33:59.654 --> 34:01.373
Oh, that's pouring with rain.

34:01.374 --> 34:04.293
Look at that thing go.

34:04.294 --> 34:08.572
Come on now. All right.
That's an intense stare
you've got going on there.

34:08.574 --> 34:11.092
Clint Eastwood for a second.

34:11.094 --> 34:13.612
And into the first corner.

34:13.614 --> 34:16.853
This can go as a very, very wet lap.

34:16.853 --> 34:19.652
No brake lights there, that's good.

34:19.654 --> 34:21.373
Trundling.

34:21.373 --> 34:22.734
Come on, you pig. Keep going.

34:22.735 --> 34:24.853
Did I say "Come on, you pig"?

34:24.853 --> 34:26.652
Yes, I think you probably did.

34:26.654 --> 34:28.733
The Cee'd gripping well as it...

34:28.734 --> 34:31.733
Where are you going? I've no idea.

34:31.734 --> 34:34.132
It's tricky.
Now the Hammerhead, was this OK?

34:34.134 --> 34:36.493
You managed to stay
between the lines?

34:36.494 --> 34:38.572
Yes, come on, get the back around.
TYRES SQUEAL

34:38.574 --> 34:43.172
A bit of understeer and some
tyre squeal despite the conditions.

34:43.174 --> 34:46.132
Yes, you're moving, just.

34:46.134 --> 34:47.414
Come on, come on, come on!

34:47.415 --> 34:50.213
Come on, Kia.

34:50.214 --> 34:55.493
How many people say "Come on, Kia?"
Now where are you going?

34:55.494 --> 34:58.973
Left! Left! Left!
I was getting a big...

34:58.974 --> 35:02.053
That's not fast there,

35:02.054 --> 35:04.053
not fast at all.

35:04.054 --> 35:06.213
I was floored right there.
I had it floored.

35:06.214 --> 35:10.213
There's obviously something stuck
behind the accelerator pedal.

35:10.214 --> 35:12.613
Come on, spin a little bit. Come on!

35:12.614 --> 35:15.173
Where are you now?

35:15.174 --> 35:20.694
And you're being a rock star there,
all over the place. But across
the line, there we are!

35:24.854 --> 35:26.094
So...

35:29.854 --> 35:33.613
here is the board
with many, many names on it.

35:33.614 --> 35:35.213
Where do you think you've come?

35:35.214 --> 35:36.933
Oh, man, I have no idea.

35:36.934 --> 35:41.013
If I broke two minutes
I'd be the happiest guy in the world.

35:41.014 --> 35:44.373
I can make you
the happiest man in the world.

35:44.374 --> 35:46.653
But not by much.
LAUGHTER

35:46.654 --> 35:52.933
Because, Alice Cooper, rock legend,
all-round unbelievably nice guy,

35:52.934 --> 35:55.334
you did it in one minute...

35:56.854 --> 36:02.614
56.3. Oh, yes!

36:12.974 --> 36:17.093
I don't know, really,
what to say about that
other than it was terrible.

36:17.094 --> 36:20.413
But, you know what? I'm proud
of that. Do you know what I am?

36:20.414 --> 36:23.253
I'm so grateful to you
for coming on because it's been

36:23.254 --> 36:26.413
such an honour to meet you. You
were nothing like I was expecting.

36:26.414 --> 36:29.853
I thought you'd eat the television
and kill someone in the audience.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.733
Come and see the show, I do that.

36:31.734 --> 36:36.614
I'd love to see it.
Ladies and gentlemen, Alice Cooper.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

36:46.976 --> 36:51.975
Now, as you know, here on
Top Gear it's our job

36:51.976 --> 36:55.335
to keep you up-to-date with
all that's new and cutting edge

36:55.336 --> 36:58.096
in the ever-changing world
of modern motoring.

37:01.976 --> 37:07.295
Hello, viewers.
James Paddy May Hopkirk here,

37:07.296 --> 37:12.656
driving a rally version
of the original Mini Cooper S.

37:12.936 --> 37:17.295
And that's quite a special feeling
because, even though it rose to fame

37:17.296 --> 37:24.936
because of all that Swinging '60s
stuff, the Mini is actually the most
iconic rally car of all time.

37:26.536 --> 37:29.335
If you're one of our
younger viewers or were hoping

37:29.336 --> 37:36.415
to watch the Antiques Roadshow but
you can't find the remote, let me
give you a quick history lesson.

37:36.416 --> 37:40.975
This tiny machine shocked the rally
world by winning the prestigious

37:40.976 --> 37:48.335
Monte Carlo Rally in 1964,
'65 and '67.

37:48.336 --> 37:53.455
The 0 - 60 time might have been a
dreary 13 seconds but its light,

37:53.456 --> 37:57.256
compact body meant it
cornered like a go-kart.

38:01.496 --> 38:03.736
It's bloody brilliant!

38:05.336 --> 38:09.375
Everybody should drive a Mini,
everybody should own a Mini

38:09.376 --> 38:12.376
at some point or you're
incomplete as a human being.

38:15.056 --> 38:21.055
Now, like any form of motorsport,
rallying needs cars that are
stars in their own right.

38:21.056 --> 38:24.415
It's why Formula 1 needs Ferrari.

38:24.416 --> 38:28.376
And that's why modern
rallying needs another Mini.

38:29.496 --> 38:32.776
And now, at last, it's got one.

38:37.896 --> 38:43.056
This is the brand-new
World Rally Championship Mini.

38:45.216 --> 38:51.415
But whereas the old car was
something of a giant slayer,
this new one is really...

38:51.416 --> 38:55.095
just a bit of a giant and it's
because it's based on this car,

38:55.096 --> 38:58.015
the Mini Countryman
which isn't really a Mini at all.

38:58.016 --> 39:01.255
It's more of a trendy school-run
car with four-wheel drive.

39:01.256 --> 39:06.935
But if you look down here,
you'll see it says Mini.

39:06.936 --> 39:08.895
So it must be true.

39:08.896 --> 39:12.535
Let's not get bogged down
in that now...

39:12.536 --> 39:16.535
because this is the modern
Mini we're interested in.

39:16.536 --> 39:17.735
ENGINE ROARS

39:17.736 --> 39:19.976
Yes, what a racket!

39:22.296 --> 39:28.255
Whereas the original Mini had 70
horsepower, this one has around 300.

39:28.256 --> 39:31.176
It does 0 - 60 in 3.5 seconds.

39:35.056 --> 39:39.175
And this brilliant sequential
gearbox, look at this.

39:39.176 --> 39:41.375
And go!

39:41.376 --> 39:45.775
In fact, I got a bit carried away
with the gearbox.

39:45.776 --> 39:50.895
Bang! Oh! Go! Yes!

39:50.896 --> 39:53.055
Oh! Yee!

39:53.056 --> 39:56.495
By the time you watch this film,

39:56.496 --> 39:59.695
the Mini will have taken part
in its first proper rally.

39:59.696 --> 40:01.455
No, I've buggered it!

40:01.456 --> 40:06.536
But, as I drive it today, it's yet
to turn a wheel in real anger.

40:11.096 --> 40:14.815
So, we're here to find out how good
it is and we're going to do that

40:14.816 --> 40:21.616
with a typically unscientific
yet informative and hopefully
invigorating Top Gear race.

40:23.696 --> 40:27.535
And to do that, we've come back
to one of our old
Top Gear stomping grounds...

40:27.536 --> 40:31.376
the Winter Olympics
site of Lillehammer in Norway...

40:32.656 --> 40:38.255
where, several years ago,
we raced a rally car against
Richard Hammond in a bobsleigh.

40:38.256 --> 40:42.296
And on that occasion it was the
men in tights who came first.

40:45.336 --> 40:50.215
So the motor car was given a
bloody nose and has come back
with a score to settle.

40:50.216 --> 40:53.695
And because of that,
the rally mechanics here have told

40:53.696 --> 40:58.415
Captain Paddy Slow to get stuffed
and make way for their driver.

40:58.416 --> 41:05.016
He's Kris Meeke, intercontinental
rally champion and quite possibly
the fastest ginger on the planet.

41:07.216 --> 41:10.096
And as for the bobsleigh team...

41:12.616 --> 41:14.375
They're not here.

41:14.376 --> 41:19.376
Instead, the ice-sliding community
is fielding one of its biggest guns.

41:25.736 --> 41:30.136
Olympic skeleton gold
medallist Amy Williams.

41:36.336 --> 41:40.215
Right, in case you can't get Dave on
your telly, or for some other reason

41:40.216 --> 41:46.535
you haven't seen the original race
between Hammond and me, here is why
Lillehammer is the ideal venue

41:46.536 --> 41:49.535
for a rally car versus
skeleton bob shoot-out.

41:49.536 --> 41:53.975
We begin here, and this red line
is the bob track,

41:53.976 --> 41:59.295
almost two kilometres
of twisting, turning, icy terror.

41:59.296 --> 42:02.695
And this blue line is the road -
almost exactly the same length,

42:02.696 --> 42:08.815
nearly two kilometres -
and it too is twisting,
turning, yumping, icy terror.

42:08.816 --> 42:13.735
And they both end here
at the finish line.

42:13.736 --> 42:17.495
The first person there is
the winner. You realise that
the car must win this one

42:17.496 --> 42:19.335
because the car is 1-0 down.

42:19.336 --> 42:24.295
The car that has been
around for 125-odd years
now is being challenged by...

42:24.296 --> 42:26.175
My two year-old sled.

42:26.176 --> 42:30.975
A tea tray. Do you mind if I...?
I don't think people will
have seen one of these close-up.

42:30.976 --> 42:33.055
This is a skeleton bob.

42:33.056 --> 42:37.215
Your face goes that way. Face
this end and I steer here and here.

42:37.216 --> 42:40.415
By doing what? By pushing my
shoulders in and moving the sled.

42:40.416 --> 42:43.015
So your face is actually
over the end.

42:43.016 --> 42:47.415
My chin and head and helmet will be
scratching the ice on the way down.

42:47.416 --> 42:50.895
70 mph with your face...
Scraping the ice.

42:50.896 --> 42:53.735
Our faces aren't going to
scrape along the road, are they?

42:53.736 --> 42:57.655
Hopefully not. That's only if
we're going upside-down,
which we don't plan to do.

42:57.656 --> 42:59.456
Right, let's do it.

43:20.176 --> 43:23.775
As Amy imagined her
way down the run,

43:23.776 --> 43:29.776
I imagined Kris going too fast in
the dark and the pair of us rolling
end-over-end in a huge fireball.

43:38.056 --> 43:41.376
OK, here we go! Three, two, one.

43:46.736 --> 43:48.536
And we're off.

44:03.336 --> 44:05.496
Go! Go! Go!

44:06.616 --> 44:09.375
For Amy, the start is everything.

44:09.376 --> 44:14.775
Just a tenth to slow at
the top and she'll be two seconds
off the pace at the bottom.

44:14.776 --> 44:17.976
Sadly for us, she had a great start.

44:20.896 --> 44:22.656
To the left.

44:28.336 --> 44:30.815
No sign of Williams
at the crossover.

44:30.816 --> 44:34.216
That's because Williams was ahead.

44:37.376 --> 44:40.056
Go! Go! Go!

44:47.936 --> 44:52.375
At the halfway point, both Kris
and Amy were losing precious time.

44:52.376 --> 44:55.815
Kris because of
the slushy ground,

44:55.816 --> 44:59.855
and Amy because of rough ice.

44:59.856 --> 45:02.456
Fortunately, Kris could rise
above the problem.

45:20.376 --> 45:23.416
Here we go. Whoa!

45:26.736 --> 45:30.216
Less than a kilometre to go,
Kris had closed the gap.

45:32.536 --> 45:34.816
Yes, sir! Loving that.

45:38.456 --> 45:39.576
Right.

45:42.336 --> 45:44.936
Here it is, here we go.

45:47.536 --> 45:49.016
Rrr!

46:03.136 --> 46:05.536
AMY PANTS

46:13.576 --> 46:15.896
Oh, no! What did you get?

46:18.256 --> 46:20.335
Amy Williams, you did it in...

46:20.336 --> 46:22.455
What is it? What is it?

46:22.456 --> 46:26.295
You did it in 61...

46:26.296 --> 46:29.975
Point? 61.04. Yeah?

46:29.976 --> 46:32.815
We did it in...

46:32.816 --> 46:34.695
59.73! No!

46:34.696 --> 46:38.775
Sorry! Fair enough.

46:38.776 --> 46:42.495
Congratulations to you too. It's
traditional, I'm really sorry...

46:42.496 --> 46:46.175
It's bad manners, but... loser.

46:46.176 --> 46:48.335
Well done.

46:48.336 --> 46:51.616
Disappointing. Well done, Mini.

46:55.736 --> 46:58.135
I hate snow.

46:58.136 --> 46:59.896
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

47:04.416 --> 47:07.695
So, Kris... Amy! Amy!

47:07.696 --> 47:14.775
Can I first of all just say
what a pleasure it is for me
to have you back here on our show.

47:14.776 --> 47:17.975
You always bring...
a touch of joy to my heart.

47:17.976 --> 47:20.095
Thank you.

47:20.096 --> 47:26.015
This steering thing -
you say you use your shoulders -
how does that actually work?

47:26.016 --> 47:33.015
So the inside of a sled pretty much
is like a pivot point in the middle
so, if I steer one shoulder there,

47:33.016 --> 47:36.775
the pivot point will move
and the runners grip the ice.

47:36.776 --> 47:39.296
Do you have to do that really fast?

47:41.896 --> 47:43.455
Sometimes, yes.

47:43.456 --> 47:45.295
Sometimes slow, sometimes fast.

47:45.296 --> 47:48.055
Is your hair naturally curly?

47:48.056 --> 47:49.695
Yes, this is normal.

47:49.696 --> 47:52.096
It's normal? Very lovely.

47:54.216 --> 47:56.855
What's your favourite song?
Oh, for God's sake.

47:56.856 --> 47:59.336
Kris. Sorry, we don't have
time to talk to the man.

47:59.337 --> 48:04.015
No, we do have time to talk to
the man. How did it get on, the
Mini, in its first proper rally?

48:04.016 --> 48:06.655
Well... Well, there we are, good.
Now I want to talk

48:06.656 --> 48:10.335
about planning permission because,
if you want to change your house

48:10.336 --> 48:13.975
in this country, you have
to go to the council for permission.

48:13.976 --> 48:20.655
This is to stop people putting up
pink conservatories and generally
ruining the heritage of Britain.

48:20.656 --> 48:26.416
It all makes sense but I think
the planners have overlooked
an important detail.

48:28.616 --> 48:33.056
This is the pretty little
village of Chilham in Kent.

48:35.616 --> 48:41.375
And careful planning means all of
the houses are still very lovely.

48:41.376 --> 48:44.855
But look here. The owner of
this house wouldn't be allowed

48:44.856 --> 48:52.095
by the planners to fit uPVC
windows or stone cladding,
but he's allowed to festoon

48:52.096 --> 48:58.295
the parking space outside his house
with a hideous Chrysler PT Cruiser.

48:58.296 --> 49:00.256
It makes no sense.

49:02.176 --> 49:07.735
If I had my way, only one
car would be allowed in a
village as lovely as this.

49:07.736 --> 49:12.175
A car that, this year,
is celebrating its 50th birthday.

49:12.176 --> 49:16.535
The beguiling, bewitching, beautiful

49:16.536 --> 49:18.296
E-type Jag.

49:22.976 --> 49:28.056
Over the years,
there have been many pretty cars.

49:30.096 --> 49:35.416
But Enzo Ferrari described the
E-type as the prettiest of them all.

49:38.896 --> 49:43.335
And what makes that extraordinary
is that it was shaped at night

49:43.336 --> 49:47.215
in a rudimentary early-days wind
tunnel that used so much electricity

49:47.216 --> 49:51.736
it could only be operated when
the rest of the country was asleep.

49:54.136 --> 49:58.335
And everyone was still asleep
when the car itself was tested

49:58.336 --> 50:05.735
because the only place where
they could actually run it
up to its 149 mph top speed

50:05.736 --> 50:07.336
was at 5am on the M1.

50:09.496 --> 50:13.695
It was on one of those high-speed
runs they discovered the roof

50:13.696 --> 50:15.255
would flap about so,

50:15.256 --> 50:20.215
to weigh it down, a string of
lead shot was sewn into the canvas.

50:20.216 --> 50:23.775
And there was a similar
make-do-and-mend attitude
to the rear suspension.

50:23.776 --> 50:29.975
The chief engineer was given
just a month to design
an entirely new system.

50:29.976 --> 50:34.055
The boss, Sir William Lyons,
bet him a fiver he couldn't do it.

50:34.056 --> 50:40.776
He did, and Jag used exactly the
same set-up for the next 25 years.

50:42.256 --> 50:46.015
Lyons, in fact,
was completely underwhelmed
by the finished product.

50:46.016 --> 50:51.175
He didn't like the look
of the back end and didn't
think it would sell. He was wrong.

50:51.176 --> 50:58.215
Because when
the E-type was unveiled at
the Geneva Motor Show in March 1961,

50:58.216 --> 50:59.776
it was an instant hit.

51:01.536 --> 51:05.535
Such was demand for test drives
that a second demonstrator

51:05.536 --> 51:09.935
was driven through
the night from the factory
in Coventry to Switzerland.

51:09.936 --> 51:13.856
And this is that very car.

51:21.256 --> 51:23.335
OK, let's see
what the old girl can do.

51:23.336 --> 51:28.495
I know it's genesis,
I know this is the very first
convertible E-type ever,

51:28.496 --> 51:32.376
but I have to find out what it's
like when we give it some noise.

51:34.416 --> 51:36.016
Oh-ho-ho!

51:37.416 --> 51:39.456
Ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

51:42.216 --> 51:45.975
Can you imagine what it must
have been like in 1961?

51:45.976 --> 51:51.135
You've been to the bakery,
you've queued for a week for a loaf
of bread, you're on your way home

51:51.136 --> 51:56.735
in black-and-white
in your Humber and you
were overtaken by one of these.

51:56.736 --> 51:59.735
It must have been staggering.

51:59.736 --> 52:01.296
"What was that?!"

52:02.696 --> 52:07.535
It's the same age, this car
and me, give or take.

52:07.536 --> 52:09.135
It has aged better.

52:09.136 --> 52:11.136
Still looks good.

52:12.336 --> 52:17.935
But it wasn't just the looks that
astonished everyone back in 1961.

52:17.936 --> 52:23.655
Back then, the equivalent
Ferrari or Maserati was £6,000.
A little bit more, in fact.

52:23.656 --> 52:28.855
This was £2,098, and this,

52:28.856 --> 52:34.576
thanks to its 3.8 litre
straight-six engine, was faster.

52:36.776 --> 52:38.336
Oh-ho-ho!

52:40.056 --> 52:41.856
This is just heaven.

52:44.696 --> 52:48.416
Even by today's standards,
that's a lot of go.

52:55.096 --> 53:00.055
Small wonder the E-type became a
must-have accessory for the jet set.

53:00.056 --> 53:04.935
Princess Grace, Steve McQueen,
Tony Curtis,

53:04.936 --> 53:08.215
Britt Ekland, Frank Sinatra,
George Best,

53:08.216 --> 53:12.375
Roy Orbison, Charlton Heston,
Count Basie.

53:12.376 --> 53:14.976
They all had E-type Jags.

53:17.696 --> 53:22.175
No car before
ever caused such a stir

53:22.176 --> 53:24.256
and no car has since, really.

53:29.456 --> 53:31.296
Until now.

53:35.176 --> 53:38.295
This is called the Eagle Speedster.

53:38.296 --> 53:44.135
Made by a small engineering company
in Sussex, it looks like an E-type.

53:44.136 --> 53:48.175
It's even based on an E-type
but there have been some changes.

53:48.176 --> 53:51.295
The aluminium body is deeper,

53:51.296 --> 53:54.775
the windscreen is lower
and more steeply raked.

53:54.776 --> 53:58.855
The wheels are new,
and the tyres, and the brakes.

53:58.856 --> 54:01.296
And the interior.

54:04.016 --> 54:08.375
If someone had come to me asking
for planning permission to alter

54:08.376 --> 54:13.175
an E-type Jaguar, I'd have said no,
don't be stupid, you'll mess it up!

54:13.176 --> 54:15.855
But they haven't.

54:15.856 --> 54:23.056
I think this, by a long way, is the
most beautiful car I've ever seen.

54:25.056 --> 54:29.136
It might actually be the most
beautiful THING I've ever seen.

54:33.016 --> 54:36.455
And the surgery isn't just cosmetic.

54:36.456 --> 54:41.855
Under the bonnet there's a
fuel-injected 4.7 litre straight-six

54:41.856 --> 54:49.336
which sends its power to the rear
wheels through a five-speed gearbox
and an aluminium differential.

54:53.936 --> 54:57.455
As a result of all the aluminium,
which doesn't weigh very much,

54:57.456 --> 55:01.335
this has a better power-to-weight
ratio than a Porsche 911 Turbo,

55:01.336 --> 55:05.896
and, as a result of that,
it can do 0 - 60 in 5 seconds.

55:06.896 --> 55:10.016
Flat out, it'll do 160.

55:12.776 --> 55:17.576
And then there's the noise.
ENGINE ROARS

55:21.016 --> 55:24.176
Ha-ha-ha!

55:25.976 --> 55:28.775
It's spitting fire.

55:28.776 --> 55:32.136
It's a spitfire! That's what it is.

55:38.656 --> 55:40.936
The looks, the noise!

55:53.256 --> 55:55.815
This, to me, is...

55:55.816 --> 55:59.896
absolute perfection.

56:01.136 --> 56:04.015
I'll put my hand on my heart
and say here and now

56:04.016 --> 56:09.816
I've never ever driven a car,
ever, that I've wanted more
than this one.

56:16.376 --> 56:19.136
I yearn to have it.

56:26.136 --> 56:30.735
There is, however, a problem.

56:30.736 --> 56:36.695
Because every single piece of this
car, pretty much, was hand-made,

56:36.696 --> 56:38.455
the price is fantastic.

56:38.456 --> 56:40.495
Enormous. Eye-watering.

56:40.496 --> 56:47.215
I didn't know numbers went this
high, but it turns out they do,
so sit down, I'm going to say it.

56:47.216 --> 56:49.896
Here we go. The Eagle Speedster...

56:50.976 --> 56:56.696
is half a million pounds.
Half a million.

56:59.016 --> 57:04.015
That's a lot for a toy.
A car that doesn't even have a roof.

57:04.016 --> 57:07.015
But this is more than a toy.

57:07.016 --> 57:10.055
It's a modern take
on the E-type Jag.

57:10.056 --> 57:12.855
And the E-type, with
the possible exception of Concorde,

57:12.856 --> 57:17.816
is almost certainly the last
truly great thing Britain made.

57:19.936 --> 57:25.375
I think we should be more proud
of it than we actually are.

57:25.376 --> 57:31.135
Its 50th birthday was marked
by a small piece on page 16
of the Daily Telegraph

57:31.136 --> 57:36.815
and I don't think that's right,
which is why I've organised
something a little more substantial.

57:36.816 --> 57:42.455
BAND PLAYS
I've organised something which
recognises that this is the soul,

57:42.456 --> 57:47.135
the spirit, the beating heart
of all that we can be.

57:47.136 --> 57:55.135
The E-type isn't a plucky Brit
that's happy to come home second, it
wouldn't be humiliated by Barcelona.

57:55.136 --> 57:58.295
It wouldn't simply
wave Sebastian Vettel by.

57:58.296 --> 58:02.495
And if you asked an E-type
to organise a royal wedding,

58:02.496 --> 58:06.495
it wouldn't ferry the guests
to Westminster Abbey
in a fleet of minibuses.

58:06.496 --> 58:10.855
The E-type doesn't know
what a minibus is.

58:10.856 --> 58:13.175
Every country has an icon.

58:13.176 --> 58:17.935
The great nation of France
has the big brown pylon
in the middle of Paris.

58:17.936 --> 58:19.615
Australia has a rock.

58:19.616 --> 58:22.775
The Belgians have
a urinating infant.

58:22.776 --> 58:25.895
Well this, I put it to you, is ours.

58:25.896 --> 58:30.495
Our Jerusalem, our chariot of fire,
the maypole around which the people

58:30.496 --> 58:35.415
of this funny little rock
in the North Atlantic can gather,
to remind ourselves

58:35.416 --> 58:38.536
that, once upon a time,
we really were as great...

58:40.296 --> 58:41.776
as we think we are now.

59:16.816 --> 59:19.976
ENGINE FAILS

59:21.176 --> 59:22.935
It won't start.

59:22.936 --> 59:27.496
APPLAUSE

59:34.696 --> 59:38.175
A stirring but nicely understated
tribute there, I thought.

59:38.176 --> 59:42.175
But you said something that worried
me - with the possible
exception of Concorde,

59:42.176 --> 59:45.575
the E-type was the last great
thing Britain made. Is that right?

59:45.576 --> 59:50.615
Can you think of anything
we've made since which you
go, "that's a world-beater"?

59:50.616 --> 59:55.095
The E-type was a third the price
of the Ferrari, as I said,
and faster, and better-looking.

59:55.096 --> 01:00:00.175
The only thing I can think that even
gets close really is Monty Python,
that moved the world on.

01:00:00.176 --> 01:00:02.815
What about those vacuum cleaners
with no bags in them?

01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:05.375
We invented those and they're
pretty good, they're clever.

01:00:05.376 --> 01:00:08.615
Hammond, I'm not sure that, in 50
years' time, people will be having

01:00:08.616 --> 01:00:12.935
a big birthday party on
Beachy Head with people going,
"These Dysons are brilliant!"

01:00:12.936 --> 01:00:15.575
I'm not sure that's going to happen.

01:00:15.576 --> 01:00:21.175
Moving on, the Eagle Speedster -
is it really that good? Look at it.

01:00:21.176 --> 01:00:23.575
Seriously, just look at it.

01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:28.255
It's beautiful to behold, yes,
but how can it really be worth

01:00:28.256 --> 01:00:31.095
five times more than an
immaculate original E-type?

01:00:31.096 --> 01:00:32.855
I can demonstrate that, Hammond.

01:00:32.856 --> 01:00:36.696
I can demonstrate that because,
if I step in here, OK? Listen.

On that bombshell, it's time to end.

01:00:50.336 --> 01:00:52.696
Thank you very much for watching.
Good night!
