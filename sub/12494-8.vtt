00:00.375 --> 00:01.875
Previously on Good Luck Charlie...

00:01.959 --> 00:03.458
One week ago, the new baby was due.

00:04.208 --> 00:05.500
Let's see how that baby's doing now.

00:06.458 --> 00:08.166
I want you out!

00:08.417 --> 00:10.083
Well, think about it.
Wouldn't it be kind of sad

00:10.166 --> 00:12.166
if Charlie had to share her birthday
with the new baby?

00:12.250 --> 00:15.000
I went online and I looked up
some natural ways to induce labor.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.917
Bob, with five kids,
I think we might need a new car.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.750
Will you be driving home
in a Serenade today?

00:19.834 --> 00:21.208
Depends on what you can do for me.

00:21.291 --> 00:22.542
I need you to go down to the mall.

00:22.625 --> 00:24.041
I need you to get that doll for Charlie.

00:24.125 --> 00:27.208
You're gonna buy this game
with the doll money.

00:27.291 --> 00:29.041
We got to get that level nine monster.

00:29.125 --> 00:31.375
Maybe you're the monster.

00:31.667 --> 00:33.291
It's my birthday, too.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.000
Teddy.

00:39.959 --> 00:40.959
Morning, mom.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.125
Teddy.

00:42.458 --> 00:43.875
I can't have this baby today.

00:45.208 --> 00:47.792
Charlie needs to have
her special birthday.

00:47.875 --> 00:50.000
That's what I've been saying all along.

00:50.083 --> 00:51.542
Yeah, but now I'm saying it.

00:53.667 --> 00:56.125
Okay, well, what made you
change your mind?

00:56.208 --> 00:57.917
I had this horrible dream last night.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.542
The entire family
was just being so mean to Charlie,

01:00.625 --> 01:01.750
ignoring her.

01:01.834 --> 01:02.834
Even you.

01:02.917 --> 01:04.291
What were you doing in the dream?

01:04.792 --> 01:06.709
I was doing what I always do.

01:07.750 --> 01:09.750
Fighting bravely to make things right.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.542
Okay, look, the point is
I can't have the baby today.

01:15.417 --> 01:17.417
Charlie needs her special day.

01:17.792 --> 01:21.000
All right, well,
however you got here, I totally agree.

01:21.125 --> 01:23.417
We'll just make sure that
you don't have the baby until tomorrow.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.083
Exactly. Okay.

01:25.208 --> 01:27.709
Okay, operation get baby out

01:27.792 --> 01:30.417
has officially become
operation keep baby in.

01:30.792 --> 01:34.083
I need complete rest and relaxation, okay?

01:34.166 --> 01:38.250
Nothing but peace, calm, and quiet.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.458
Morning, honey.

01:41.542 --> 01:42.583
I said quiet!

01:44.917 --> 01:46.792
Yeah. Another day in paradise.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.083
Hi, we'd like to return this game, please.

02:49.166 --> 02:50.083
Has it been opened?

02:50.166 --> 02:51.041
Nope.

02:52.417 --> 02:53.834
Then why is it covered in tape

02:53.917 --> 02:56.458
and what appears to be teeth marks?

02:58.083 --> 02:59.000
Okay.

02:59.583 --> 03:00.917
I'm gonna level with you.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.542
We bought this game by accident.

03:03.625 --> 03:05.750
And then, Jake here...

03:06.250 --> 03:07.792
accidentally opened it.

03:07.875 --> 03:10.917
And then we accidentally played it
for six hours.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.458
Guys, I'm sorry, you can't return this.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.291
Oh, no, we don't want to return it.

03:16.375 --> 03:17.583
We wanna exchange it...

03:18.166 --> 03:19.041
for money.

03:21.417 --> 03:22.333
Next.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.959
Oh, this is bad.

03:26.375 --> 03:27.583
What am I gonna do?

03:27.667 --> 03:29.291
Only thing you can do.

03:29.333 --> 03:30.834
You gotta steal the doll.

03:30.917 --> 03:32.583
Steal the doll? But that's wrong.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.417
Well, exactly. You know the old saying,

03:34.500 --> 03:35.834
"Two wrongs make a right."

03:36.917 --> 03:39.000
No, it's "Two wrongs don't make a right."

03:39.083 --> 03:39.959
Oh.

03:40.208 --> 03:41.792
Well, then, you know the other old saying,

03:41.875 --> 03:43.375
"Sometimes, you gotta steal a doll."

03:45.208 --> 03:46.917
I'm not gonna steal the doll.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.375
Well, can we at least steal candy?

03:49.458 --> 03:50.417
No.

03:50.959 --> 03:53.041
Then what's the point
of even going to the store?

03:56.959 --> 04:02.041
Both: Serenade! Serenade! Serenade!

04:02.125 --> 04:03.625
Yeah.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.333
Well...

04:11.875 --> 04:14.375
Hope you learned something
from the whole car-buying experience.

04:14.458 --> 04:15.375
Sure did, dad.

04:15.375 --> 04:16.250
What's that, son?

04:17.333 --> 04:19.083
Can't we just leave it
at a "Sure did, dad"?

04:20.792 --> 04:22.667
I'm talking about the negotiation.

04:22.750 --> 04:23.667
Look...

04:24.959 --> 04:27.000
Someday you're gonna have
a family of your own.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.834
And you're gonna have to buy a new car.

04:28.917 --> 04:30.875
And you know what you're
gonna say to your kid?

04:34.583 --> 04:36.458
The car doesn't fit in the garage?

04:37.542 --> 04:38.458
What?

04:39.041 --> 04:40.875
Then I'll say, "It's not my fault, son.

04:40.959 --> 04:42.709
I learned all this from your grandpa Bob."

04:42.792 --> 04:44.917
And he'll say, "Oh, that explains it."

04:45.000 --> 04:46.667
Then we'll laugh and get ice cream.

04:50.041 --> 04:51.041
Well, you asked.

04:56.166 --> 04:58.208
Then everybody
was being really mean to you.

04:58.792 --> 05:01.250
But don't you worry,
I did what I always do.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.875
Fought bravely to make things right.

05:06.166 --> 05:08.166
Charlie, you have the best mommy
in the world.

05:08.917 --> 05:10.041
Even in a dream.

05:11.625 --> 05:12.458
Charlie?

05:12.959 --> 05:14.333
I made you a special birthday lunch.

05:14.417 --> 05:15.792
It's in the kitchen.

05:15.875 --> 05:16.875
Teddy: Let's go get it!

05:17.709 --> 05:18.542
Yay.

05:20.625 --> 05:22.083
Okay, um, mom...

05:22.625 --> 05:25.083
I was just wondering
about Charlie's birthday party.

05:25.166 --> 05:26.125
Oh, honey.

05:26.208 --> 05:27.709
I have to rest.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Would you please take care of that for me?

05:30.083 --> 05:31.125
Yeah, I got it.

05:31.208 --> 05:33.166
Everything you need to know
is in a file in the kitchen.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.166
Got it.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.583
Teddy, you have really been there for me,

05:37.667 --> 05:38.875
and I just...

05:39.250 --> 05:40.834
I'm just so thankful, and...

05:41.458 --> 05:43.083
You're my rock.

05:43.166 --> 05:44.500
I don't know what I'd do without you.

05:44.583 --> 05:46.083
Yeah.

05:46.792 --> 05:48.083
How are the hormones, mom?

05:48.166 --> 05:49.750
All over the place.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.500
Charlie, how'd you like
your special pony-shaped sandwich?

06:03.083 --> 06:04.458
All right. Well.

06:04.542 --> 06:06.542
Glad I spent an hour cutting it out.

06:07.375 --> 06:08.375
Party folder.

06:08.750 --> 06:09.917
Hey, Charlie, come with me.

06:10.542 --> 06:11.959
Ready? Oh!

06:15.458 --> 06:16.333
Okay.

06:16.917 --> 06:17.750
What?

06:18.125 --> 06:20.333
Mom forgot to mail the invitations?

06:22.250 --> 06:23.333
Do you know what this means?

06:23.417 --> 06:24.250
No.

06:24.333 --> 06:25.166
Good.

06:25.417 --> 06:27.125
You wait here. I'll be right back.

06:28.917 --> 06:30.625
Dad, hi. Okay.

06:30.709 --> 06:31.709
Big problem. So,

06:31.792 --> 06:34.500
you know how mom's been kinda spacey
with the pregnancy?

06:34.583 --> 06:37.000
Well, she forgot to plan
Charlie's birthday party.

06:37.083 --> 06:38.792
You think you got problems?

06:38.875 --> 06:41.125
The garage is 31 inches too short.

06:41.583 --> 06:43.291
Oh, the garage is too short?

06:43.375 --> 06:45.083
Now it's the garage's fault?

06:45.166 --> 06:47.834
Yeah, car-buying expert here
didn't measure the--

06:47.917 --> 06:49.500
She doesn't need to know the details.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.041
She has her own situation.

06:51.125 --> 06:53.041
Didn't you hear?
Mom made a big, dumb mistake.

06:54.542 --> 06:55.917
Well, so what, what am I gonna do?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.542
Charlie's in there waiting for her party.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.375
Okay, all right. Give me, uh...

06:59.542 --> 07:00.709
Give me a minute to think.

07:03.041 --> 07:03.875
Okay.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.375
Give me another minute.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.000
Well, I--

07:09.083 --> 07:11.166
I guess I could try calling
some of Charlie's friends,

07:11.250 --> 07:12.458
see if they can come over.

07:13.083 --> 07:14.583
Pick up a cake at the store...

07:14.667 --> 07:15.875
Before you buy the cake,

07:15.959 --> 07:17.417
you might wanna measure the fridge.

07:17.834 --> 07:19.000
Know what I'm saying, dad?

07:28.417 --> 07:31.208
Hi, Mrs. Dickson,
it's Teddy Duncan calling.

07:31.750 --> 07:33.208
Listen, so I'm throwing together

07:33.291 --> 07:35.625
a little last-minute birthday party
for Charlie,

07:35.709 --> 07:37.625
and I was just wondering
if Megan could come.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.041
Oh. Chicken pox.

07:42.125 --> 07:43.291
Poor little thing.

07:43.917 --> 07:45.750
But, you know,
she doesn't have to stay for long.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.041
Okay.

07:50.125 --> 07:51.208
Okay, I understand.

07:51.250 --> 07:52.625
Oh, you know what?

07:52.709 --> 07:53.834
As long as I've got you,

07:54.625 --> 07:56.917
is there any chance
that Mr. Dickson is a...

07:57.000 --> 08:00.125
is a clown or a magician, or...

08:02.333 --> 08:03.250
Hello?

08:07.917 --> 08:10.500
Hi, um, is this Cake World?

08:10.583 --> 08:11.917
Yeah, yeah, hi.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.125
I need a cake. Um...

08:14.458 --> 08:15.625
You're out of cake?

08:17.208 --> 08:19.333
You realize you're called "Cake World."

08:19.417 --> 08:22.375
Which means, right now,
you're just "world."

08:23.917 --> 08:25.875
Yeah, well, I don't like
your attitude, either.

08:28.750 --> 08:29.583
Hello?

08:34.583 --> 08:37.750
Hi, uh, hi, is this
"Al's Amazing Animals"?

08:38.250 --> 08:41.291
Yeah, um, listen,
I know that it's last minute,

08:41.375 --> 08:43.583
but I'm trying to put together
this birthday party.

08:44.166 --> 08:46.709
What's the most amazing animal you've got?

08:49.208 --> 08:51.000
A monkey who does tricks for cake.

08:52.166 --> 08:53.625
Yeah, we're gonna have a problem.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.792
Um, by any chance,

08:56.875 --> 08:59.375
does the monkey come with its own cake?

09:02.709 --> 09:03.667
Hello?

09:06.375 --> 09:07.875
Who's coming to my party?

09:09.250 --> 09:11.083
You know, I'm really not sure.

09:11.917 --> 09:14.250
Hey, you know who might be fun
to have at your party?

09:14.375 --> 09:15.208
Who?

09:15.250 --> 09:17.083
The kids from the playground.

09:17.166 --> 09:18.333
Yay!

09:20.041 --> 09:21.041
What kids?

09:21.125 --> 09:23.166
Well, we won't know until we get there.

09:23.625 --> 09:25.458
Yay!

09:26.000 --> 09:27.083
Whoo-hoo!

09:32.792 --> 09:34.250
Okay, that's as far as I can go.

09:34.333 --> 09:35.291
How's she looking?

09:35.375 --> 09:36.417
It's a she?

09:36.792 --> 09:37.750
How can you tell?

09:40.083 --> 09:41.500
Could you just press the button?

09:42.917 --> 09:44.000
All right, here it goes.

09:50.750 --> 09:51.834
Lookin' good.

09:52.750 --> 09:53.792
Lookin' good.

10:00.583 --> 10:01.542
So close.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.375
Hmm.

10:11.166 --> 10:12.375
PJ was right.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.083
The squares aren't as much fun
as the sticks.

10:19.291 --> 10:21.083
But I'm gonna eat some more anyway.

10:27.125 --> 10:28.500
So, what are you gonna do?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.083
Well, what choice do I have?

10:30.166 --> 10:31.375
I have to tell my dad the truth.

10:31.458 --> 10:34.166
The truth? Dude, that game messed you up.

10:35.375 --> 10:37.250
You know, if you came in
and shared some of the blame,

10:37.333 --> 10:38.542
they'd probably go easier on me.

10:40.250 --> 10:41.250
Guess we'll never know.

10:43.834 --> 10:44.792
Gotta admit...

10:45.375 --> 10:46.959
I like that kid's style.

10:53.333 --> 10:56.125
Okay, you. You stay right where you are.

10:57.709 --> 10:59.125
Little more. Stop!

11:02.333 --> 11:03.834
Little more.

11:04.458 --> 11:05.291
Stop!

11:09.750 --> 11:11.375
Little more. Stop!

11:12.041 --> 11:12.959
Okay.

11:13.917 --> 11:14.917
We're getting there.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.417
No, we're not! This is ridiculous.

11:18.500 --> 11:19.583
Dad, calm down.

11:19.667 --> 11:20.834
No, that's it! That's it!

11:20.917 --> 11:22.250
I'm done. Done!

11:22.875 --> 11:24.792
Taking this tank back to the...

11:24.875 --> 11:25.709
Dealer!

11:34.375 --> 11:35.500
Dealer's that way.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.250
Uh-oh.

11:59.333 --> 12:01.250
It looks bad from this side, too.

12:03.542 --> 12:05.125
Dad, I have to tell you...

12:05.834 --> 12:06.917
It can wait.

12:08.000 --> 12:08.959
Uh-oh.

12:09.709 --> 12:11.375
Hey, dad. Great news.

12:11.917 --> 12:13.125
Garage door closes.

12:15.208 --> 12:17.000
Guys, Charlie's birthday party is...

12:17.834 --> 12:19.291
not our biggest problem.

12:21.083 --> 12:22.083
Uh-oh.

12:22.792 --> 12:24.125
Why do you keep saying, "uh-oh"?

12:24.208 --> 12:25.166
Why do you think?

12:25.917 --> 12:26.792
The baby's coming.

12:26.875 --> 12:27.959
- Oh!
- Okay, all right.

12:28.041 --> 12:30.542
We gotta get mom to the hospital.
Come on, honey. Get in the car.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.917
Car's in the wall, Bob.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.125
Come on, I'll drive. Ed's out front.

12:35.208 --> 12:36.166
Ed? Who's ed?

12:36.250 --> 12:37.625
That's the name of my car.

12:37.709 --> 12:40.083
Ed? So is that short for Edward?

12:40.166 --> 12:41.333
Edgar? Edwin?

12:41.417 --> 12:43.917
- Edwin...
- Bigger issues, PJ!

12:44.000 --> 12:45.709
Okay, we really need to go.

12:45.792 --> 12:46.834
Okay, come on.

12:47.959 --> 12:50.041
You guys have to throw Charlie
her birthday party.

12:50.125 --> 12:51.750
I'm gonna drive mom to the hospital.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.375
Why do we always get the hard things?

12:55.875 --> 12:57.000
You know...

12:58.041 --> 12:59.542
I always thought
you would be the first one

12:59.625 --> 13:01.041
to drive a car into the kitchen.

13:02.542 --> 13:03.542
Me, too.

13:09.625 --> 13:11.709
Hey, how you doin', honey?

13:11.792 --> 13:13.750
It'd be a lot better if you were quiet!

13:14.500 --> 13:15.750
She wants me to be quiet.

13:16.250 --> 13:18.542
Gotta be quiet. Why can't I be quiet?

13:19.667 --> 13:21.959
Dad, were you this panicky
when the rest of us were born?

13:22.041 --> 13:23.583
Uh... no.

13:23.667 --> 13:26.333
Because the first four times we did this,
we were at a hospital!

13:28.375 --> 13:29.917
We did this, yeah.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.250
Yeah, you wanna take over?

13:32.792 --> 13:34.375
Okay, everybody relax.

13:34.458 --> 13:36.208
We're on our way.
We're gonna be there shortly.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.500
Right after this...

13:39.583 --> 13:40.917
slight delay.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
You're outta gas.

13:44.959 --> 13:46.875
You're outta gas! Aw, Teddy.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.959
How could you be so irresponsible?

13:49.041 --> 13:51.375
Says the guy
who drove a car into our kitchen.

13:56.333 --> 13:57.625
Close your eyes. There you go.

13:58.291 --> 13:59.208
Okay.

14:00.250 --> 14:01.709
Ready?

14:02.208 --> 14:03.208
Keep 'em closed.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.041
Okay. And...

14:05.125 --> 14:06.625
Both: Surprise!

14:06.709 --> 14:07.709
Gabe: Hey!

14:07.792 --> 14:10.083
Look who came to your party, Charlie.

14:10.166 --> 14:13.250
Three of your oldest and bestest friends.

14:13.375 --> 14:14.208
Aw. Hmm.

14:14.625 --> 14:16.959
Tennis ball head. Aw.

14:17.625 --> 14:18.792
Scary clown.

14:21.291 --> 14:22.792
And...

14:24.583 --> 14:26.208
Badly-damaged monkey.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.959
I, I don't think she likes it.

14:30.875 --> 14:32.375
Well, she's about to.

14:32.458 --> 14:34.125
- Oh, okay.
- 'Cause...

14:35.542 --> 14:38.458
Both: Ta-da! Happy birthday!

14:38.542 --> 14:40.083
It's your special birthday cake.

14:40.417 --> 14:41.875
That's not cake.

14:42.458 --> 14:44.250
It's your special birthday bagel.

14:46.875 --> 14:49.458
Mm, bagel. Tennis ball head's favorite.

14:49.542 --> 14:51.750
Mm. Yum, yum, yum.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.667
Where's my present?

14:54.041 --> 14:55.625
Yeah, did you get
the Kuddle Me Katie doll?

14:56.125 --> 14:57.208
What is this, "60 minutes"?

14:57.291 --> 14:58.208
Just enjoy the party.

14:59.917 --> 15:04.083
Charlie, we have got some really fun
party games planned.

15:04.166 --> 15:05.125
Like...

15:05.208 --> 15:06.834
Watching TV!

15:06.917 --> 15:08.333
Both: Yay!

15:09.250 --> 15:11.250
I want princesses.

15:11.333 --> 15:12.166
Really?

15:12.792 --> 15:14.625
Uh, did mommy promise you a princess?

15:14.709 --> 15:17.208
Mommy said, "Two princesses, please."

15:18.917 --> 15:21.291
All right, you heard her, Princess.

15:21.375 --> 15:22.375
Make it happen.

15:23.000 --> 15:23.959
Mommy said two.

15:29.333 --> 15:30.333
Just breathe.

15:30.834 --> 15:32.333
I'm sure dad will find us a ride soon.

15:32.417 --> 15:34.834
Yeah, 'cause he's so good with cars?

15:37.250 --> 15:39.375
Hey, sorry it took so long.

15:39.458 --> 15:41.792
You went for ice cream
at a time like this?

15:41.875 --> 15:43.208
Uh, well...

15:43.375 --> 15:45.166
Actually, the ice cream came to me.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.458
You're taking me to the hospital
in an ice cream truck?

15:53.542 --> 15:55.792
You said to flag down
the first thing I saw.

15:55.875 --> 15:58.417
Why? What's the matter?
The giant hot dog wouldn't stop?

15:58.542 --> 15:59.333
Yeah.

16:00.166 --> 16:01.000
Bob: Okay.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.250
Push, Teddy.

16:05.250 --> 16:07.166
Welcome aboard mustachio Pete's,

16:07.250 --> 16:09.667
the ice cream truck
with the pistachio treats.

16:09.750 --> 16:13.041
FYI, pistachio has been discontinued.

16:13.417 --> 16:14.875
Bob, I need to lie down.

16:14.959 --> 16:16.709
- Okay.
- You can use that bean bag chair.

16:16.792 --> 16:19.208
It's where mustachio Pete
takes his ten-minute breaks,

16:19.250 --> 16:21.750
which mustachio Pete is allowed by law.

16:22.375 --> 16:23.875
You're not gonna keep
referring to yourself

16:23.959 --> 16:25.208
in the third person, are you?

16:25.291 --> 16:26.458
Yes, he is.

16:27.375 --> 16:29.291
That's mustachio Pete's trademark.

16:29.375 --> 16:30.667
That, and the pistachio,

16:30.750 --> 16:31.875
which, FYI...

16:31.959 --> 16:33.291
All: Has been discontinued.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.208
We get, we... Okay. Come on, honey.

16:36.792 --> 16:39.125
Oh, if things get bad back there,

16:39.208 --> 16:40.625
bite down on a rocket pop.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.208
Bob: Ooh, cool, I will.

16:42.291 --> 16:43.542
Amy: He meant me!

16:44.375 --> 16:45.917
Can we get going? It's an emergency.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.083
Emergency?

16:47.166 --> 16:49.125
This calls for the fast-paced music.

17:08.542 --> 17:09.667
Ready, Charlie?

17:09.750 --> 17:11.375
It's Princess time!

17:24.125 --> 17:25.083
Uh-oh.

17:25.583 --> 17:27.834
I seem to have lost my sister Princess.

17:28.417 --> 17:29.792
Excuse me.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.041
- Get out there!
- Gabe: But I feel stupid!

17:33.125 --> 17:34.875
- You think I don't?
- Gabe: You're used to it!

17:34.959 --> 17:35.834
Go!

17:40.959 --> 17:42.166
Dance, Princess.

17:42.917 --> 17:45.000
Left and right.

17:46.834 --> 17:49.417
And we cast a spell.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.041
And we twirl, and we twirl.

17:52.125 --> 17:53.375
And we curtsy!

17:55.083 --> 17:56.417
Aww.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.625
Look at that smile.

17:57.709 --> 17:58.917
We gotta go again.

17:59.291 --> 18:00.125
What?

18:00.208 --> 18:02.291
But, this time, stay with me.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.959
And five, six, seven, eight.

18:06.041 --> 18:08.000
Left, right...

18:08.834 --> 18:09.959
Can't you go any faster?

18:10.250 --> 18:12.208
We're already doing 23.

18:12.250 --> 18:13.750
I'm giving her all she's got.

18:15.709 --> 18:16.667
Okay.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.166
Baby's close. How much further?

18:18.250 --> 18:20.625
You're not helping yourself
to any freebies back there,

18:20.709 --> 18:21.583
are you, Bob?

18:21.667 --> 18:23.166
I'm a stress eater, Pete.

18:23.625 --> 18:25.542
You don't have to tell me about stress.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.834
The ice cream truck business
is dog-eat-dog.

18:29.125 --> 18:32.208
I got sideburn Sam nippin' at my heels.

18:32.542 --> 18:34.834
Could we just focus on the road, Pete?

18:36.041 --> 18:39.041
But both princesses are so beautiful.

18:39.458 --> 18:42.625
How could I ever choose
just one to be my wife?

18:44.875 --> 18:46.250
Dude, that's your line.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.333
Oh, right.

18:47.917 --> 18:49.834
Well, I guess there's only one way.

18:50.375 --> 18:53.166
See whose foot fits the magic slipper.

18:53.250 --> 18:54.417
Okay.

19:00.333 --> 19:01.375
'Tis not I

19:01.458 --> 19:03.417
whose foot doth fit the slipper.`

19:05.542 --> 19:07.333
Yes, 'tis not me, either.

19:07.959 --> 19:12.166
But, sister Princess,
you have not tried on the slipper.

19:12.458 --> 19:14.375
I doth not want to.

19:14.458 --> 19:16.333
Oh, yeth you will.

19:16.959 --> 19:18.417
Or I will hurteth you.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.417
With my fitht.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.542
Oh, joy.

19:28.625 --> 19:29.667
It fits.

19:31.458 --> 19:32.709
My bride!

19:32.792 --> 19:35.458
At long last I have found you.

19:36.041 --> 19:38.667
And they seal their love with a kiss.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.166
- Okay, we're done!
- Bah!

19:44.250 --> 19:45.542
Yeah, not quite.

19:46.083 --> 19:47.417
We're gonna go again from the top.

19:48.166 --> 19:49.458
Maybe you'll get it right this time.

19:56.917 --> 19:57.875
Hey...

19:58.792 --> 20:00.083
I'm gonna need your help back here.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.291
Dad, I don't know how to deliver a baby.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.333
Honey, you just gotta help me.

20:05.375 --> 20:08.208
Amy: All alone back here! Just sayin'.

20:09.917 --> 20:10.875
Okay.

20:16.750 --> 20:18.250
- How you doin', mom?
- Hey.

20:18.333 --> 20:20.667
This baby is coming now.

20:21.250 --> 20:22.250
Then...

20:22.834 --> 20:23.834
Let's have a baby.

20:24.375 --> 20:25.625
Okay, Teddy.

20:26.250 --> 20:27.458
Here we go.

20:34.625 --> 20:36.542
Oh, wow.

20:36.625 --> 20:39.041
Well, hello, number five.

20:39.959 --> 20:42.041
What a beautiful baby boy.

20:42.125 --> 20:43.166
Bob: Aww.

20:43.625 --> 20:44.750
Isn't he precious?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.208
We got here as fast as we could.

20:48.291 --> 20:49.208
All: Hi.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.291
There's the birthday girl.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.875
Happy birthday.

20:53.458 --> 20:54.333
Charlie, come here.

20:55.625 --> 20:57.000
Meet your new baby brother.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.375
Brother? Cool.

21:00.792 --> 21:01.834
Hey, what name did you pick?

21:01.917 --> 21:04.000
Well, we decided to call him...

21:04.625 --> 21:05.542
Toby.

21:06.667 --> 21:07.500
Hey.

21:07.583 --> 21:09.875
I came up with that one. Nice.

21:10.375 --> 21:13.041
Welcome to the world, Toby Duncan.

21:15.166 --> 21:17.250
Hey, quick question.

21:17.875 --> 21:19.583
Why are you guys dressed like that?

21:21.500 --> 21:22.792
Oh, because...

21:22.875 --> 21:25.208
Mom promised Charlie
princesses for her party.

21:25.291 --> 21:27.375
I never promised Charlie princesses.

21:30.458 --> 21:32.041
Charlie, did you trick us?

21:35.250 --> 21:38.000
Sweetie, did you get
your special birthday present,

21:38.083 --> 21:39.041
Kuddle Me Katie?

21:39.125 --> 21:40.417
No, mommy.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.250
What? Why not?

21:42.333 --> 21:43.166
Bob?

21:43.250 --> 21:44.250
Gabe?

21:44.375 --> 21:45.333
PJ?

21:45.417 --> 21:46.250
Teddy?

21:46.333 --> 21:47.250
Gabe?

21:49.000 --> 21:49.917
Oh.

21:50.917 --> 21:52.083
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

21:53.125 --> 21:54.709
Wasn't much of a birthday, was it?

21:54.792 --> 21:56.291
That's okay, mommy.

21:57.625 --> 22:00.125
Now, don't you worry.
We will get you your special present.

22:00.208 --> 22:02.041
I like this present.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.166
Okay, listen up. Here's the plan.

22:13.250 --> 22:15.083
So, when they come through the front door,

22:15.166 --> 22:18.542
you guys are gonna hold up this banner.

22:19.083 --> 22:21.000
Here. Take that.

22:21.083 --> 22:23.083
And, Charlie, you're gonna give mommy
these balloons.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.667
And I'm gonna blow the noisemaker.

22:24.750 --> 22:27.041
And then we're all gonna sing
"Welcome Home, Toby"

22:27.125 --> 22:29.125
to the tune
of the rock classic "Our House".

22:30.709 --> 22:32.041
Why do you get to blow the noisemaker?

22:32.125 --> 22:33.834
And why are we making
such a big deal outta this?

22:33.917 --> 22:35.625
They bring a new baby home
like every six months.

22:35.709 --> 22:36.625
Yeah.

22:37.709 --> 22:38.834
This is what we always do.

22:38.917 --> 22:39.875
We did it for Charlie.

22:39.959 --> 22:40.875
Did you do it for me?

22:40.959 --> 22:42.458
Uh... yeah.

22:44.166 --> 22:45.333
- You're lying!
- No, I'm not.

22:45.417 --> 22:46.291
Yeah, you are.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.875
You know what? If you didn't do it for me,

22:51.959 --> 22:53.458
I'm not doing it for Toby.

22:53.542 --> 22:55.208
No matter how cool his name is.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.917
Gabe, just pick up the stupid banner

22:59.000 --> 23:01.208
and join in this very touching
family celebration!

23:02.500 --> 23:03.333
You can't make me.

23:03.417 --> 23:05.166
Well, if he's not gonna do it,
I'm not gonna do it.

23:06.667 --> 23:08.625
It looks like Charlie could have made it.

23:08.709 --> 23:11.208
- Gabe: It looks like Charlie...
- It's like a mess to begin with

23:11.250 --> 23:12.875
if I'm going to be honest.

23:13.625 --> 23:14.542
Good to be home.

23:17.959 --> 23:19.917
This is what it's all about, isn't it?

23:20.208 --> 23:21.041
Now...

23:25.458 --> 23:27.041
So let me show you around.

23:28.125 --> 23:29.959
This is your home, Toby. Yeah.

23:30.458 --> 23:31.333
Yeah.

23:31.959 --> 23:34.125
This is the living room.

23:40.041 --> 23:41.500

Giving Toby a proper welcome home.

24:54.750 --> 24:58.250
Well, Charlie,
it's been kind of a big week.

24:58.333 --> 25:00.417
I, uh, I helped deliver a baby,

25:00.458 --> 25:02.208
our little brother, Toby,

25:02.291 --> 25:05.250
and you finally got your Kuddle Me Katie.

25:08.542 --> 25:11.083
Which you lost interest in
five minutes after you got it.

25:11.667 --> 25:13.500
Doesn't matter,
Gabe's still paying for it.

25:13.583 --> 25:16.083
He worked out a little agreement
with mom and dad.

25:16.208 --> 25:18.834
Amy: Gabe! Diaper change!

25:18.917 --> 25:20.542
And it's a doozy.

25:20.625 --> 25:21.667
Gabe: Coming.

25:29.542 --> 25:30.959
Wish him good luck, Charlie.
