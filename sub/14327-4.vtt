ALL ABOUT THAT, TIMMY.

COSMO REACTED IN
A NEGATIVE FASHION.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.991
IN THE FACE OF YOUR
POWERFUL VICTORY.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.493
IS THIS TRUE?

20:44.576 --> 20:48.372

21:36.378 --> 21:39.047

FAIRY WORLD AGAIN.

BOSS YOU AROUND?

22:16.001 --> 22:17.377
{\an1}NO!

22:17.461 --> 22:20.130
CAN YOU AT LEAST
MAKE ME SOME RICE?

22:20.213 --> 22:22.215

YOUR OWN COURSE.

22:33.351 --> 22:34.603
I DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA GET YOU

22:34.686 --> 22:35.979
MUCH EXTRA CREDIT,

I'M JUST SORT OF HOPING

22:43.361 --> 22:44.571

EXPELLED.

22:44.654 --> 22:47.574
{\an5}HEH HEH! LIKE THE
PIXIES GOT EXPELLED
FROM FAIRY WORLD?

22:47.657 --> 22:49.659
