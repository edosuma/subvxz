00:05.257 --> 00:12.129
Only one creature has carved a life
for itself in every habitat on Earth.

00:12.177 --> 00:15.931
That creature is us.

00:18.017 --> 00:24.934
All over the world we still use our
ingenuity to survive in the wild places,

00:24.977 --> 00:30.051
far from the city lights,
face to face with raw nature.

00:31.137 --> 00:34.732
This is the Human Planet.

00:47.377 --> 00:50.414
Grass is a remarkable plant.

00:50.457 --> 00:54.450
It supports a great abundance of life.

00:55.737 --> 00:59.127
Wheat, rice, barley and corn,

00:59.177 --> 01:02.533
they're all grasses and they feed us.

01:05.177 --> 01:09.216
And the grasslands feed the animals
that feed our world too.

01:12.257 --> 01:16.250
Our lives on the grasslands have
transformed the planet,

01:16.297 --> 01:18.333
from the prairies of America

01:18.377 --> 01:21.335
to the rice terraces of China.

01:24.137 --> 01:26.014
But it's not been easy.

01:26.057 --> 01:29.970
It's taken every last ounce of
human courage and ingenuity

01:30.017 --> 01:33.930
to become masters of the grasslands.

02:10.937 --> 02:15.089
Dawn on the savannah
in southern Kenya.

02:17.297 --> 02:21.848
It's the moment Rakita and his mates
have been waiting for.

02:23.537 --> 02:27.815
The wildebeest migration has arrived.

02:30.777 --> 02:35.532
Here, lush grasses support the largest
herds of animals in the world.

02:35.577 --> 02:39.490
A bounty of opportunity
for these Dorobo hunters.

02:42.377 --> 02:46.370
But there's fierce competition
for all this meat on the hoof

02:46.417 --> 02:50.808
from some of the world's
most efficient killers.

03:19.697 --> 03:23.326
So how do mere humans,
without fangs or claws,

03:23.377 --> 03:27.689
who can't outrun a wildebeest,
get a meal around here?

03:30.617 --> 03:34.212
Rakita uses brains and teamwork.

03:38.657 --> 03:42.013
His plan is to let the lions
kill the wildebeest,

03:42.057 --> 03:46.255
then he'll steal their dinner
from right under their noses.

03:48.857 --> 03:51.735
His two friends are essential.

03:51.777 --> 03:55.053
Lions aren't easily intimidated.

03:58.497 --> 04:03.252
First, Rakita must find the tracks
of a lion pride on the hunt.

04:08.537 --> 04:12.735
At 65, he's a veteran hunter
and takes the lead.

04:15.457 --> 04:20.372
They must watch their backs -
this is man-eater territory.

04:41.737 --> 04:46.606
All the signs point to
a fresh kill nearby.

05:07.137 --> 05:13.576
Rakita's been attacked by lions before.
He knows this could end badly.

05:42.337 --> 05:46.853
They're up against 1 5 hungry lions,
but, if they act as one,

05:46.897 --> 05:51.607
they might just intimidate the lions
and push them off their kill.

05:58.577 --> 06:03.810
They make their move.
Self-confidence is everything.

06:09.097 --> 06:13.056
This is the ultimate face-off.

06:19.817 --> 06:24.254
Suddenly, the lions back off.

06:38.257 --> 06:42.853
Rakita has just minutes before
the lions realise it's a bluff.

06:56.137 --> 07:00.449
In a matter of seconds, he butchers
the haunch of the wildebeest,

07:00.497 --> 07:02.567
and they beat a hasty retreat.

07:27.377 --> 07:31.416
This is a scene which has played out
throughout human existence,

07:31.457 --> 07:36.451
hunters using brains, not brawn,
to outwit their mighty competitors.

08:21.777 --> 08:25.690
Getting another animal
to do the killing for you is clever,

08:25.737 --> 08:29.935
but making the kill yourself is
an even bigger challenge.

08:33.177 --> 08:37.136
At the other end of Africa, on the edge
of the Kalahari Desert,

08:37.177 --> 08:43.730
lies a much drier grassland,
supporting far fewer animals.

08:43.777 --> 08:46.974
There's no free lunch here.

08:49.337 --> 08:52.852
!Kun and N/ /ao are
Ju/'hoansi bushmen.

08:52.897 --> 08:55.969
!Kun is a master hunter,

08:56.017 --> 09:01.330
one of a handful of Ju/'hoansi who
still have the skills to hunt big game.

09:01.377 --> 09:06.815
So !Kun is teaching his apprentice
to keep this precious knowledge alive.

09:15.217 --> 09:17.777
The hunt begins by kindling fire.

09:28.457 --> 09:33.485
They burn the grass from around the
only waterhole for many kilometres.

09:36.337 --> 09:40.091
They know the animals will
ultimately come to drink here

09:40.137 --> 09:44.130
and when they do,
they'll have nowhere to hide.

09:48.617 --> 09:52.895
Their bows and dart arrows are
too small to kill outright,

09:52.937 --> 09:55.895
so they refine their weapons.

09:57.337 --> 10:02.775
!Kun, the master, knows exactly
where to find poison.

10:05.617 --> 10:09.849
Within this hardened sand shell
is a beetle grub.

10:09.897 --> 10:15.972
If just one drop of beetle juice gets
into the tiniest cut, it will kill him.

10:16.017 --> 10:19.646
He anoints his arrows with great care.

10:24.657 --> 10:29.526
But their prey are wily too,
so they build a grass hide.

10:29.577 --> 10:32.250
This is an ambush.

10:35.497 --> 10:39.809
!Kun wants his apprentice to get
his first kudu.

10:51.697 --> 10:54.655
The antelope's acute hearing
and sharp eyes

10:54.697 --> 10:58.610
mean he must learn to move silently
and without being seen.

11:02.857 --> 11:05.087
But N/ /ao has been spotted.

11:07.497 --> 11:10.295
The moment is lost.

11:25.377 --> 11:29.655
Two days later, the bushmen are
still in their hide,

11:29.697 --> 11:33.133
hoping that the kudus'thirst
will overcome their fear.

11:34.457 --> 11:36.129
But they stay away.

11:39.257 --> 11:43.091
Then even the master
is caught unprepared.

11:44.697 --> 11:46.528
It's a leopard.

11:46.577 --> 11:50.490
Suddenly the hunters risk
becoming the hunted.

11:55.377 --> 12:00.087
A leopard's jaws have the power
to crush a human skull.

12:25.897 --> 12:29.014
They're praying
the leopard hasn't seen them.

12:29.057 --> 12:32.732
N/ /ao lies low in the shadows.

12:41.577 --> 12:45.331
This time they've managed
to remain undetected.

12:54.417 --> 12:57.250
It's day six in the hide

12:57.297 --> 13:00.767
and the apprentice is no closer
to getting a meal.

13:02.737 --> 13:04.853
A new group of kudu come in.

13:09.257 --> 13:11.896
They've got one chance.

13:13.297 --> 13:16.095
Both men raise their bows.

13:18.097 --> 13:22.329
Bull's-eye! An arrow has hit home
and the kudu scatter.

13:36.977 --> 13:39.855
The injured kudu will run
for many kilometres

13:39.897 --> 13:44.448
with the poison arrow in its flank,
as the toxins slowly take effect.

13:46.137 --> 13:48.412
The pursuit begins.

13:49.977 --> 13:52.537
First, they must find the arrow shaft.

13:52.577 --> 13:57.014
It will show them which tracks to follow
and also who made the hit.

14:17.417 --> 14:20.887
From here on, it's all about tracking.

14:21.897 --> 14:25.207
The ground is criss-crossed
with hoof prints.

14:25.257 --> 14:28.852
The wrong decision will mean
a wild-goose chase.

14:59.337 --> 15:00.611
While tracking,

15:00.657 --> 15:04.696
the hunters look at the landscape
through the eyes of their prey.

15:16.457 --> 15:21.167
After ten hours, they finally catch up
with the kudu.

15:28.977 --> 15:35.416
The poison has weakened it.
She's exhausted, near death.

15:40.137 --> 15:44.972
N/ /ao aims a spear to the heart
to deliver a swift end.

16:10.977 --> 16:16.051
After seven days,
N/ /ao has finally killed his first kudu.

16:19.137 --> 16:23.130
Now there is one more person
in the world who can do this.

16:23.177 --> 16:26.931
The meat they'll carry home will feed
their whole village.

16:26.977 --> 16:30.367
And every part of the animal
will be put to use.

16:33.417 --> 16:40.050
This burnt landscape looks dead,
but grass is incredibly resilient.

16:41.097 --> 16:44.134
With the first drops of rain,
it regenerates.

16:47.137 --> 16:49.731
And where these rains become floods,

16:49.777 --> 16:53.690
grass grows to keep pace
with the rising waters.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.251
Around the world,

16:58.297 --> 17:01.528
many grasslands undergo
such extreme seasonal changes,

17:01.577 --> 17:03.932
bringing new opportunities,

17:03.977 --> 17:06.969
but also lurking dangers.

17:12.617 --> 17:17.168
In Cambodia, the grasslands around
Tonle Sap lake are flooding...

17:18.377 --> 17:22.734
...and for a few short weeks
there are rich pickings to be had.

17:25.337 --> 17:28.295
It's Vaana's big chance
to make a killing.

17:30.257 --> 17:36.526
He's here to hunt an unexpected,
hidden and potentially fatal wild prey.

18:01.297 --> 18:04.494
Vaana's hunting skill lies
in recognising

18:04.537 --> 18:09.657
the difference between an easy meal
and a deadly catch.

18:16.817 --> 18:18.933
But it's not fish he's after.

18:18.977 --> 18:21.775
It's snakes!

18:26.017 --> 18:29.976
There are many millions of them
in this flooded grassland.

18:30.017 --> 18:34.613
Most are edible water snakes
but some are venomous.

18:35.937 --> 18:40.135
If he pulls up a cobra,
its bite could kill him.

18:42.097 --> 18:44.372
It's a game of Russian roulette.

18:49.377 --> 18:53.370
Even his five-year-old son
has to be a snake expert.

18:53.417 --> 18:57.854
Knowing which is which
means survival here.

18:59.577 --> 19:01.693
The snakes gather
in these huge numbers

19:01.737 --> 19:05.650
to hunt the fish which spawn
in the submerged grass.

19:15.417 --> 19:18.295
It's no time to be squeamish.

19:18.337 --> 19:23.457
Every escapee sees Vaana's profits
slither away.

19:34.137 --> 19:37.971
Vaana's whole family must
get to grips with snakes.

19:45.337 --> 19:48.647
For the kids,
they are welcome new toys.

20:26.537 --> 20:30.655
Vaana's catch is destined for
the biggest snake market in the world.

20:30.697 --> 20:35.691
Over 6 million snakes change hands
in a matter of weeks.

20:59.097 --> 21:02.089
His payment for
a week's snake wrangling...

21:02.137 --> 21:05.174
60p.

21:18.457 --> 21:23.326
But survival in the grasslands
isn't all about hunting.

21:27.097 --> 21:32.569
In East Africa, the Masai have learnt
how to collaborate with a wild bird

21:32.617 --> 21:37.054
to get a sweet treat they can only get
if they work together.

21:42.257 --> 21:46.091
Leitato is whistling to attract
a honey guide.

21:48.097 --> 21:50.850
It's a bird that is aptly named.

21:56.217 --> 21:58.970
The honey guide answers
their whistles

21:59.017 --> 22:03.010
with a call it only uses
to talk to humans.

22:15.337 --> 22:18.852
She starts a game of
Follow My Leader...

22:23.017 --> 22:26.976
...since only she can smell
the food they're after.

22:33.377 --> 22:36.449
When she's close to the prize,
she changes her call,

22:36.497 --> 22:39.614
letting them know
they're getting hotter.

22:53.137 --> 22:57.927
The boys have hit the jackpot -
a beehive. The bird's job is done.

23:11.377 --> 23:16.371
Now they have to fulfil their part of
the bargain -getting the honey out.

23:21.017 --> 23:26.250
It's hidden deep in the tree protected
by hundreds of angry African bees.

23:31.177 --> 23:34.135
They use smoke to calm them.

23:38.217 --> 23:42.290
But it doesn't make the stings
any less painful.

23:56.737 --> 23:59.535
The boys know they have to pay
their guide.

23:59.577 --> 24:03.536
Honeycomb with added grubs.

24:17.657 --> 24:22.253
It's the perfect partnership,
but, as every Masai boy knows,

24:22.297 --> 24:24.936
if you don't give the honey guide
its reward,

24:24.977 --> 24:28.333
next time it will lead you
to a lion's den!

24:34.177 --> 24:38.329
So we've learnt how to find food
in the wild grasslands,

24:38.377 --> 24:42.052
either on our own,
or with a bit of help from others.

24:43.817 --> 24:48.049
But our mastery of the grasslands
took a huge leap forward

24:48.097 --> 24:51.851
when we learnt how to exploit
the grass itself.

24:54.217 --> 24:59.337
Wheat, maize and rice all started life
as wild grasses,

24:59.377 --> 25:02.096
which we've bred into crops.

25:06.697 --> 25:11.134
This has enabled us to feed
millions of people every year,

25:11.177 --> 25:15.853
and so we've settled down
and built homes beside our fields.

25:19.017 --> 25:22.373
But this man-made abundance
is irresistible

25:22.417 --> 25:25.090
to many animals we now call pests.

25:31.617 --> 25:38.090
On the African plains these cereal killers
come in plague proportions.

25:43.017 --> 25:45.929
Isiah lives in Tanzania.

25:45.977 --> 25:52.530
His rice harvest is just days away, but
he knows an aerial attack is imminent.

26:03.217 --> 26:06.846
He must be vigilant, ever alert
to the sound he dreads.

26:10.417 --> 26:12.533
The noise comes first...

26:17.657 --> 26:20.888
...then the advance party...

26:24.857 --> 26:27.166
...followed by the swarm.

26:29.497 --> 26:31.249
They are quelea.

26:31.297 --> 26:36.166
They come in their millions
and people call them locust birds.

26:50.657 --> 26:53.774
They are the most numerous
bird species on Earth,

26:53.817 --> 26:55.535
ravenous for grain.

27:04.097 --> 27:09.217
Isiah and his neighbours must try
to prevent the quelea from settling,

27:09.257 --> 27:13.216
otherwise the flock will strip
their crop in an hour.

27:17.577 --> 27:22.605
It's not a battle he can win,
it's about limiting his losses.

27:27.897 --> 27:33.176
As the seeds ripen, these migrant flocks
never stand still.

27:33.217 --> 27:36.653
But they do have an Achilles heel.

27:36.697 --> 27:39.973
In order to breed,
the quelea must stop,

27:40.017 --> 27:43.896
weaving thousands of nests
in tight colonies.

27:45.777 --> 27:49.531
This is the farmers'chance
to strike back.

27:57.817 --> 28:03.175
While most of the flock is away feeding,
a deadly trap is laid.

28:17.537 --> 28:20.449
The birds return as dusk falls.

28:56.297 --> 29:01.530
So far, we're one step ahead
in the arms race with the pests.

29:02.577 --> 29:05.614
And our ability to manipulate
the grasslands

29:05.657 --> 29:08.046
has gone from strength
to strength.

29:10.777 --> 29:14.452
We have supersized
these man-made grasslands...

29:16.417 --> 29:19.056
...sculpting mountains, felling forests

29:19.097 --> 29:22.328
and redesigning the very surface
of our planet.

29:25.457 --> 29:30.212
Seven grasses feed
almost seven billion people.

29:31.657 --> 29:35.013
They supply three-quarters
of our carbohydrates,

29:35.057 --> 29:38.367
bread and pasta,
noodles and porridge.

29:45.177 --> 29:49.489
These artificial great plains are
making wild grasslands

29:49.537 --> 29:52.893
amongst the most endangered
habitats on Earth.

29:56.857 --> 30:01.612
Yet it was on the wild grasslands,
which support vast grazing herds,

30:01.657 --> 30:05.047
that we achieved perhaps
our greatest triumph...

30:05.097 --> 30:08.772
to subjugate these animals
to our needs.

30:10.497 --> 30:13.011
Controlling a plant is one thing,

30:13.057 --> 30:16.333
but dominating a creature
with its own free will

30:16.377 --> 30:19.767
requires a far higher level
of manipulation.

30:23.177 --> 30:27.409
The Mongolian steppe is
the biggest grassland on Earth.

30:28.457 --> 30:33.736
There are more horses running wild here
than anywhere else in the world.

30:38.177 --> 30:40.737
The Mongols'ability to tame horses

30:40.777 --> 30:44.486
has made these nomads
masters of the steppe.

30:44.537 --> 30:48.610
And, in a family of horsemen,
Ulaana is the best.

30:53.497 --> 30:55.806
He's got riding in his blood.

30:55.857 --> 31:00.214
His ancestor Genghis Khan used
horse power to build an empire

31:00.257 --> 31:05.092
but today, Ulaana's family face
a different challenge.

31:11.297 --> 31:16.246
They must use their horses'speed
and stamina to capture wild mares.

31:23.497 --> 31:27.695
Driving the wild herd back to the ger
camp is only the beginning of a day

31:27.737 --> 31:31.696
that will test Ulaana's agility
and strength to the limit.

31:37.657 --> 31:43.175
Ultimately he's after the mare's milk,
but it's not that straightforward.

31:53.817 --> 31:57.253
These wild mares don't give up
their milk easily.

31:57.297 --> 31:59.527
They have to be tricked into it.

31:59.577 --> 32:03.729
His success will depend on
total partnership with his horse.

32:22.977 --> 32:27.846
First, Ulaana lassoes the foals,
so the mares will stay close.

32:27.897 --> 32:31.253
But even the foals are feisty.

32:36.417 --> 32:39.056
Ulaana leans behind his horse,

32:39.097 --> 32:43.170
using its strength and weight
to resist the pull of the foal.

32:48.617 --> 32:53.691
He must balance at a gallop,
using only his knees.

33:06.977 --> 33:08.695
Once he's caught a foal,

33:08.737 --> 33:13.447
his cousin Tungaa must get
a halter on before it escapes.

33:14.657 --> 33:18.411
It is the first time they have felt
the touch of a human hand.

33:21.777 --> 33:25.486
Once they're tethered,
Ulaana can move on to the mares.

33:27.257 --> 33:32.775
This is the real battle -
mares are five times his weight.

33:58.337 --> 34:01.773
With Ulaana at full stretch,
everyone lends a hand.

34:36.537 --> 34:40.769
After two exhausting hours,
the men begin to get the upper hand.

34:50.377 --> 34:54.575
Haltered and hobbled,
this mare is finally subdued.

34:57.857 --> 35:01.247
Then they're left to calm down
with their foals.

35:03.977 --> 35:07.652
Only with the foal suckling
will the mare let down her milk

35:07.697 --> 35:12.487
and then Tungaa has a brief chance
to draw some off for the family.

35:19.577 --> 35:24.093
But Mongolians prefer their milk
with a twist.

35:27.417 --> 35:31.808
Their innovation has been to ferment
this sugary milk into airag,

35:31.857 --> 35:34.576
a slightly alcoholic yoghurt.

35:42.657 --> 35:45.410
The yoghurt bacteria turns the milk

35:45.457 --> 35:48.255
into their most nutritious
summer food.

36:24.697 --> 36:26.653
Without harming their animals,

36:26.697 --> 36:30.212
Ulaana's family can live off them
year after year,

36:30.257 --> 36:32.452
turning the goodness of grass
into yoghurt

36:32.497 --> 36:38.208
but, having bound their lives to
the grazing herds, they are nomads,

36:38.257 --> 36:42.808
following the herds on their perpetual
search for fresh pastures.

37:19.177 --> 37:23.614
In other cultures, we have taken
this mastery a step further,

37:23.657 --> 37:26.217
taming and breeding the wild herds,

37:26.257 --> 37:29.454
making them docile
and easy to handle.

37:30.737 --> 37:34.650
In the African savannah,
herders keep their cattle close.

37:34.697 --> 37:36.335
They are owned now

37:36.377 --> 37:41.929
and, like property owners everywhere,
men will fight to protect them.

37:44.137 --> 37:47.174
In the grasslands of
southern Ethiopia,

37:47.217 --> 37:50.493
the Suri take this protection
to extremes.

37:52.457 --> 37:56.689
Here, rival tribes even fight battles
over cattle.

37:56.737 --> 38:00.616
So Suri herders must become warriors.

38:06.257 --> 38:10.136
Shahuri will stop at nothing
to defend his herd.

38:28.497 --> 38:31.216
For the Suri, cattle are currency.

38:31.257 --> 38:35.011
Too valuable to kill,
they care for them intimately.

38:42.897 --> 38:46.776
Every year Shahuri must undergo
a ritual trial of courage

38:46.817 --> 38:50.776
to prove he's got what it takes
to be a cattle warrior.

38:54.257 --> 38:58.250
He gets strength for the combat ahead
directly from his cows

38:58.297 --> 39:00.253
by drinking their blood.

39:00.297 --> 39:03.733
It may look brutal,
but it doesn't kill them.

39:08.017 --> 39:12.533
This rich blood gives Shahuri
essential protein and iron,

39:12.577 --> 39:15.694
and his prize animal will
recover quickly.

39:25.657 --> 39:27.966
The vicious ritual of donga

39:28.017 --> 39:32.454
will make or break Shahuri's
reputation as a cowboy.

39:34.897 --> 39:36.728
It's the day of judgment.

39:36.777 --> 39:41.771
The rival Suri clans arrive,
psyched up and ready for donga.

39:49.457 --> 39:52.096
It lasts a day.

39:52.137 --> 39:55.049
You pick an opponent
from the neighbouring village for a duel.

39:55.097 --> 39:59.568
The more victories you win,
the greater your courage.

40:04.577 --> 40:06.693
Shahuri walks to the ring.

40:06.737 --> 40:10.935
Even taking part in this ritual
takes serious guts.

40:10.977 --> 40:16.495
He has no armour.
His only defence is a lucky sunhat.

40:21.377 --> 40:24.847
Shahuri watches and waits.

40:44.457 --> 40:49.815
The donga sticks are two metres long.
They can cause serious injury.

40:49.857 --> 40:54.214
To win, you must thrash
your opponent until surrender.

41:03.657 --> 41:08.447
Finally, Shahuri is ready for battle.

41:27.257 --> 41:32.934
It's a victory, but not emphatic.
To prove himself, he fights again.

41:39.577 --> 41:45.607
Suddenly his opponent backs down.
Shahuri is the champion.

41:56.057 --> 42:00.209
Lifted high, his clan celebrate
his victory.

42:10.097 --> 42:12.895
His cattle have their protector.

42:12.937 --> 42:17.613
Shahuri has proved he can be
a cowboy, Ethiopian style.

42:24.617 --> 42:30.249
But in the Australian outback,
they've reinvented the cowboy big time.

42:30.297 --> 42:36.133
Here, supersized ranches across
the country hold 30 million cattle.

42:37.257 --> 42:40.647
This is the total mastery
of man over beast,

42:40.697 --> 42:43.894
our ultimate ingenuity
in the grasslands.

42:48.297 --> 42:52.415
Round-up used to take a month.
Not any more.

43:04.497 --> 43:07.694
Ben Tapp is a muster pilot,

43:07.737 --> 43:13.414
and he must bring in 2,000 of his
best cattle in just five days to get paid.

43:15.097 --> 43:17.657
He'll need all his flying skills,

43:17.697 --> 43:23.135
his ability to read the cattle,
and his mate Rankin, if he's to succeed.

43:30.977 --> 43:33.013
If you can understand the cattle,

43:33.057 --> 43:36.129
you can already anticipate
what they're going to do.

43:36.177 --> 43:37.576
Like a good cattleman,

43:37.617 --> 43:42.566
you can identify every single beast,
and every single beast is different.

43:42.617 --> 43:45.415
His cattle are out there somewhere.

43:45.457 --> 43:49.291
Scouting by air allows Ben
to home in on them fast.

43:54.657 --> 43:59.333
It appears there's about
six or seven of them along the line.

43:59.377 --> 44:01.811
When they find a group of cows,

44:01.857 --> 44:06.055
they drop down to the "death zone"
to flush them out.

44:06.097 --> 44:08.531
Clipping any tree will be fatal.

44:14.537 --> 44:18.166
Don't put too much pressure on them.
They're fairly hot now.

44:18.217 --> 44:21.448
Just stick with that mob there.
Keep them going that way.

44:24.617 --> 44:27.085
You stick with them.
Oh, here's this mob here.

44:28.417 --> 44:31.295
There are always some
trouble-makers.

44:56.217 --> 45:00.449
We've got another...probably 1 50
coming in.

45:04.057 --> 45:07.049
The choppers work together,
pushing the growing herd,

45:07.097 --> 45:10.851
but they've got 50 kilometres
and billabongs to cross

45:10.897 --> 45:13.365
before they get to the ranch.

45:19.217 --> 45:22.812
Ben's cattle really don't
like swimming.

45:25.137 --> 45:29.016
Anywhere here, where they're
ready to cross, we'll just let them go.

45:36.377 --> 45:39.255
Oh, look out, look out!

45:39.297 --> 45:44.690
Every year, about ten muster pilots
crash and burn.

45:46.657 --> 45:48.852
Just steady up there.

45:48.897 --> 45:52.970
- They just work along where we sort of...
- Yeah.

45:53.017 --> 45:57.249
From eight kilometres out,
the ground crew joins the drive.

45:57.297 --> 46:00.334
I think we'll target
a little bit southward.

46:00.377 --> 46:02.572
Come around. Everyone's here, right?

46:02.617 --> 46:05.529
But Ben's still calling the shots.

46:06.657 --> 46:08.773
Oh, the motorbike follows. Come on!

46:11.977 --> 46:15.094
Come on, motorbike!
Motorbike follow, come on!

46:16.777 --> 46:19.974
Hurry up!
They're going to go that way!

46:23.617 --> 46:27.246
Keep them going
the way they are heading there now.

46:39.817 --> 46:44.413
Now, we don't need to wait for
the wildebeest migration,

46:44.457 --> 46:46.687
we create our own.

46:51.017 --> 46:55.169
Grasslands have allowed us
to dominate the planet.

46:55.217 --> 46:59.335
They are the landscape of
phenomenal human achievement.

47:01.177 --> 47:05.568
They underpin our present
global existence.

47:08.177 --> 47:11.772
These cattle, native to India,
raised in Australia,

47:11.817 --> 47:16.572
will soon be shipped out to feed
the international appetite for beef.

47:16.617 --> 47:18.733
And over the season...

47:18.777 --> 47:21.814
they'll make Ben a millionaire.

47:21.857 --> 47:25.645
- Are you making much out of it?
- Yeah.

47:25.697 --> 47:28.336
About 1 .3 million bucks.

47:28.377 --> 47:30.368
That's worth getting out of bed for!

47:30.417 --> 47:33.534
Yeah.

47:37.097 --> 47:41.613
Our ingenuity and teamwork,
intelligence and courage

47:41.657 --> 47:45.047
have all been refined
in the grasslands.

47:48.777 --> 47:52.326
And this uniquely human
combination of skills

47:52.377 --> 47:55.175
has enabled us to conquer the world.

48:00.617 --> 48:02.528
Without the grasslands,

48:02.577 --> 48:06.809
planet Earth would never have
become the Human Planet.

48:15.617 --> 48:19.929
Trying to steal food from the jaws
of the most powerful predator in Africa

48:19.977 --> 48:21.774
may seem to us like lunacy,

48:21.817 --> 48:25.492
but this extraordinary
and dangerous feat

48:25.537 --> 48:28.734
has been practised in Kenya
for thousands of years.

48:33.257 --> 48:38.775
But it has never been filmed before,
and may never be filmed again.

48:45.137 --> 48:49.972
The Dorobo are an ancient tribe
who live in the grasslands of East Africa.

48:50.017 --> 48:54.329
Conservation laws now stop
many of their traditional practices

48:54.377 --> 48:57.016
and so threaten their whole way of life.

49:01.537 --> 49:06.008
To record this unique sequence,
the Grasslands team needed a man

49:06.057 --> 49:10.573
who understands both lions
and the Dorobo people who live here.

49:11.857 --> 49:14.576
Jackson Looseyia, the crew's guide,

49:14.617 --> 49:17.370
has a deep understanding
of this way of life,

49:17.417 --> 49:21.012
having grown up nearby
in the Masai Mara.

49:22.537 --> 49:26.576
When I was asked by the BBC
if they are able to document this story,

49:26.617 --> 49:30.405
I said, yeah, because it's something
that I've practised myself.

49:30.457 --> 49:34.973
I've chased lions from food when
I was growing up. I knew this lifestyle.

49:35.017 --> 49:36.006
It's possible,

49:36.057 --> 49:42.087
it's just a matter of if the BBC are able
to capture this before it is gone.

49:44.377 --> 49:48.495
It won't be easy,
as the lions here aren't used to cars,

49:48.537 --> 49:50.846
so they're difficult to approach.

49:50.897 --> 49:55.209
They mainly hunt at night when it's
too dangerous to get close on foot.

49:58.777 --> 50:01.814
So the challenge is
to find a lion kill at dawn,

50:01.857 --> 50:03.370
to enable the Dorobo

50:03.417 --> 50:08.172
and big cat cameraman Warren Samuels
to do theirjobs.

50:08.217 --> 50:10.572
We've got to wait for the lion
to make the kill

50:10.617 --> 50:13.734
and it's got to be at a time when
we can still come out early morning

50:13.777 --> 50:16.814
and still have enough light
to film them on the kill.

50:16.857 --> 50:20.611
We're hoping for a lot of luck.

50:21.657 --> 50:24.217
At first light, Jackson joins the Dorobo,

50:24.257 --> 50:26.817
in the hope of tracking down
a fresh lion kill.

50:26.857 --> 50:30.213
You can see this is a footprint of
a lion, a very big lion,

50:30.257 --> 50:34.535
and you can see there's a footprint
of a wildebeest.

50:34.577 --> 50:38.047
Look here, you see,
this is a very, very big pride,

50:38.097 --> 50:40.691
looking at the number of footprints,

50:40.737 --> 50:44.207
and the number of places
that they like to drink.

50:45.337 --> 50:48.090
Because lions often hunt
just before dawn,

50:48.137 --> 50:51.254
the team have to follow them
both day and night.

50:55.297 --> 50:58.016
In Africa,
night is everything.

50:58.057 --> 51:01.413
It's terrifying, it's scary.
But it's so much alive.

51:08.297 --> 51:12.256
Do you see them? There are the lions,
we've found them, listen.

51:12.297 --> 51:18.054
Sharing the night shift with Jackson is
Human Planet researcher, Jane Atkins.

51:18.097 --> 51:21.214
We just came across lionesses
with their eight cubs

51:21.257 --> 51:23.452
quite local to where
the Dorobo guys live.

51:23.497 --> 51:27.649
But the down side of that is that when
the Dorobo do come across a kill,

51:27.697 --> 51:30.052
if it's in this area with this pride,

51:30.097 --> 51:34.693
these lionesses are going to be
a lot more aggressive and protective.

51:39.577 --> 51:42.569
The struggle to try and keep up
with this pride at night

51:42.617 --> 51:45.973
is because they cross in places that
a vehicle would not be able to cross.

51:46.017 --> 51:49.373
Once you lose them, you know,
they do stuff behind your back.

51:49.417 --> 51:52.807
So you are having to be
on the go the whole time.

51:54.497 --> 52:00.015
After following the lions all night,
they still haven't seen a kill.

52:00.057 --> 52:05.211
Warren, on the day shift, discovers
there's a very good reason why.

52:05.257 --> 52:09.250
Ideally, the situation we wanted here
was big herds of wildebeest,

52:09.297 --> 52:11.686
we wanted to get lions making kills,

52:11.737 --> 52:13.534
but the rains have come a little early,

52:13.577 --> 52:15.613
so most of the animals
are up on the plains.

52:15.657 --> 52:18.569
All we've got now are small groups
of five or six wildebeest.

52:18.617 --> 52:22.053
So we're really hoping that one of
those groups of lions gets lucky

52:22.097 --> 52:24.213
and that they manage to kill
one of them.

52:24.257 --> 52:27.090
No more groups of wildebeest.
Just that one group you can see.

52:27.137 --> 52:31.176
Four more days pass
and no lion kills have been seen.

52:33.177 --> 52:35.611
Finally, they get a shred of luck.

52:36.617 --> 52:38.812
We've got a big herd of wildebeest

52:38.857 --> 52:42.167
going through the horizon
heading to the crossings again.

52:42.217 --> 52:45.368
We may have a chance again of a kill.

52:49.657 --> 52:53.127
The crew head off on the heels
of the Dorobo.

52:53.177 --> 52:58.376
But after hours of tracking,
again there's no sign of a kill.

53:01.697 --> 53:04.655
Jane and the night shift take over.

53:08.617 --> 53:13.008
We've just come across the lionesses
and the male and all their cubs

53:13.057 --> 53:16.333
on a kill, and we are about...

53:16.377 --> 53:20.165
five metres away.

53:20.217 --> 53:23.493
The adult male is sitting now
on a wildebeest kill.

53:26.337 --> 53:31.092
We are not going to be able to film
this because, by the time it gets light,

53:31.137 --> 53:34.209
they'll have finished it.

53:34.257 --> 53:39.126
But it's absolutely amazing
to be able to see it so close.

53:40.377 --> 53:45.610
The vehicle is now surrounded
by 23 hungry lions.

53:57.537 --> 53:59.573
Oh, God!

54:03.697 --> 54:05.688
My God!

54:07.017 --> 54:11.568
We've just had a lion chewing
at our back tyre,

54:11.617 --> 54:14.848
and I absolutely kacked myself!

54:28.617 --> 54:29.732
Look at them!

54:29.777 --> 54:32.894
Not the Dorobo.
They say they do it all the time.

54:32.937 --> 54:35.326
I don't know how they do it, I mean...

54:37.297 --> 54:39.253
...it's terrifying.

54:46.097 --> 54:49.885
By dawn, the lions have
finished the kill.

54:49.937 --> 54:56.172
At the shift change, the power
of the lion's bite is revealed.

54:56.217 --> 54:58.856
Look at that, it's amazing!

54:58.897 --> 55:03.095
Quite an adrenaline-filled night, really.

55:04.537 --> 55:07.415
It's eight in the morning,
I've just finished my night shift,

55:07.457 --> 55:09.573
and although we found lions on a kill,

55:09.617 --> 55:13.326
by the time Warren came out
and it was light enough for him to film,

55:13.377 --> 55:17.006
the carcass was pretty much
ripped apart.

55:18.017 --> 55:20.611
You know, we've only got
a few more days left.

55:23.417 --> 55:26.727
At last they get the news everyone's
been waiting for.

55:26.777 --> 55:30.292
The pride they've been following
has made a fresh kill.

55:30.337 --> 55:33.773
It's light enough to film,
and the Dorobo are ready.

55:45.617 --> 55:48.654
We are just trying to find a position
where we can get a clear view.

55:48.697 --> 55:50.574
There's too much brush in the way.

55:51.937 --> 55:55.612
The crew are still worried about
the Dorobos'safety.

56:53.737 --> 56:56.251
I didn't believe
that we would get this shot.

56:56.297 --> 56:58.936
I thought the lions would
attack these guys,

56:58.977 --> 57:01.172
especially when they had their cubs.

57:01.217 --> 57:04.846
But all of a sudden,
when the big male got up and ran,

57:04.897 --> 57:09.334
I was relieved, because I thought
he would be the one which will attack us,

57:09.377 --> 57:14.212
but I'm really, really chuffed.
Great stuff! Ay-ay-ah!

57:18.177 --> 57:22.056
The special connection I've got
with the Dorobo is the lifestyle.

57:22.097 --> 57:27.296
It's pretty sad to know
that it's about to disappear.

57:27.337 --> 57:33.651
The time that I've spent with these guys,
I think it's too short.

57:33.697 --> 57:38.612
I've realised how much I have lost
and how much I have learnt so far

57:38.657 --> 57:41.933
since I have been with them
in the last two weeks.

57:43.377 --> 57:48.246
I would be very happy
if this has been captured for my kids

57:48.297 --> 57:51.016
and the rest of the generations
of the Dorobo kids,

57:51.057 --> 57:54.686
and be proud that our ancestors,
our fathers, our elders

57:54.737 --> 57:58.013
did practise this scary,
scary experience.
