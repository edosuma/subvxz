01:53.196 --> 01:55.031
<i>On this land 600 years ago,</i>

01:56.783 --> 01:59.077
<i>there lived beings that were not human.</i>

02:00.578 --> 02:02.122
<i>They were Monsters.</i>

02:03.373 --> 02:07.168
<i>There were countless
human-eating Monsters.</i>

02:09.838 --> 02:11.714
<i>But now,</i>

02:11.798 --> 02:14.884
<i>all the Monsters have disappeared.</i>

02:18.513 --> 02:20.598
<i>Except for me.</i>

02:24.018 --> 02:26.855
<i>I am the last to survive of the Monsters.</i>

02:28.565 --> 02:32.443
<i>I cannot be killed
and cannot die as I am Bulgasal.</i>

02:37.699 --> 02:40.160
<i>To put an end
to this curse of immortality,</i>

02:41.452 --> 02:44.914
<i>I have been searching
for you for 600 years.</i>

02:47.041 --> 02:48.835
<i>If I had not met you</i>

02:50.378 --> 02:52.463
<i>on that day from 600 years ago…</i>

03:06.060 --> 03:08.563
EPISODE 1

03:46.184 --> 03:50.396
LATE GORYEO

03:50.480 --> 03:51.856
I think we should go back.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.858
Where could we go when there is a famine?

03:53.942 --> 03:57.278
The Japanese pirates raided our land
and burnt it down. We cannot go back.

03:57.362 --> 04:00.740
They already reached mountain villages.
What is the army doing?

04:01.324 --> 04:04.494
What we should really
be worrying about is the Monsters.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.412
Those Monsters are everywhere.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.248
Japanese pirates and Monsters.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.416
Goryeo is doomed. Utterly doomed.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.459
Have you heard?

04:11.542 --> 04:14.671
They say the corpse-eating Monster,
Jomagu, is on this uphill path!

04:14.754 --> 04:16.881
Enough. Are you trying
to make me pee my pants?

04:19.634 --> 04:20.510
Where is it?

04:22.470 --> 04:25.056
What was that?

04:26.057 --> 04:27.892
-What was that sound?
-What…

04:28.726 --> 04:29.727
-Come on.
-Oh, dear.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.980
-Hey!
-What on earth is that?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.782
-That is…
-Oh, no.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.703
-Where are you going?
-What do we do?

04:46.786 --> 04:49.664
-Go and do something!
-Oh, no.

04:49.747 --> 04:53.001
-Gosh. What is that?
-Dear!

04:53.793 --> 04:55.628
-My dear!
-Be quiet.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.171
You will get us all killed.

05:02.176 --> 05:05.888
Jomagu.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.694
Jomagu.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.914
Take this baby…

05:33.124 --> 05:36.336
Take this baby…

05:38.921 --> 05:40.256
Take this baby…

05:48.890 --> 05:50.433
-What was that?
-Dear!

05:50.516 --> 05:52.727
Dear!

05:53.311 --> 05:54.604
What are you doing?

05:55.104 --> 05:56.647
He could have eaten you alive!

05:58.066 --> 06:02.070
This baby is cursed.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.405
It must not be born.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.741
Bulgasal will come find our baby.

06:06.824 --> 06:09.243
No. That's not true!

06:09.327 --> 06:10.787
Please snap out of it!

06:10.870 --> 06:13.164
-Bulgasal is coming after us.
-My dear.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.626
Bulgasal is coming.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.003
-Bulgasal…
-Oh, no.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.923
-Come to your senses!
-Bulgasal is coming.

06:36.646 --> 06:37.814
Dear!

06:40.233 --> 06:41.442
Dear!

06:45.613 --> 06:46.864
Dear!

07:43.004 --> 07:46.299
-Oh, no.
-She hanged herself when she was pregnant?

07:46.382 --> 07:48.384
-She hanged herself?
-How could that happen?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.553
-Goodness.
-Why did she do it?

07:51.512 --> 07:53.556
Are you all right?

08:04.609 --> 08:07.737
The baby was born from the dead mother?

08:08.237 --> 08:11.532
Yes. But it does not cry.

08:12.742 --> 08:13.951
It does not cry.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.704
It should never have been born.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.665
It should have died with the mother.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.376
Why would you say such a thing?

08:24.504 --> 08:26.756
Bulgasal has cursed the baby.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.799
-What? Bulgasal?
-The baby is cursed?

08:28.883 --> 08:31.052
It has no soul, so it cannot be killed.

08:31.135 --> 08:33.304
-Bulgasal, an evil spirit.
-What is she saying?

08:33.387 --> 08:36.766
And Bulgasal has a grudge
against your baby from a previous life.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.310
Then what should we do now?

08:39.393 --> 08:41.312
What in the world is Bulgasal?

08:41.395 --> 08:45.650
Once it has a grudge against someone,
it will chase their soul to the end.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.485
-Goodness.
-What is this?

08:50.279 --> 08:52.156
Then what will happen to us?

08:52.240 --> 08:54.242
This means we are doomed!

08:55.076 --> 08:56.536
Damn it!

08:59.038 --> 09:03.834
10 YEARS LATER

09:25.856 --> 09:27.316
Wait up.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.697
-Gosh.
-Why did it snow so much?

09:35.700 --> 09:37.743
Why did you want
to hunt on a day like this?

09:37.827 --> 09:39.579
-I had nothing to eat.
-My goodness.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.831
Damn it.

09:49.755 --> 09:52.967
That cursed boy.
Talk about having bad luck today.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.302
Come on.

09:57.346 --> 09:59.015
Wait up for me.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.433
Hurry up.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.904
Damn it.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.115
We have been living here
for ten years now.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.658
But we are still in famine,

10:17.742 --> 10:20.328
and my wife is pregnant again.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.872
I thought you had no energy
to even farm without food.

10:22.955 --> 10:26.125
Hey, farming and lovemaking
require a different kind of energy.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.376
-Gosh.
-Oh, my.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.212
Forget it.
How would a bachelor know anything?

10:30.296 --> 10:33.341
Then help me find a nice lady
I can settle down with!

10:34.425 --> 10:35.468
Gu-bong.

10:36.218 --> 10:39.597
No one wants to marry you because of
your ugly face. What can I do?

10:39.680 --> 10:41.057
You are so mean.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.393
Oh, no. My stomach has been feeling
a bit funny for a while now.

10:45.519 --> 10:46.854
Stay here for a bit.

10:46.937 --> 10:49.148
Pal-bong. Why so suddenly?

10:50.775 --> 10:54.028
My goodness.
I thought he did not eat anything.

10:55.613 --> 10:56.989
Goodness.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.586
Why are you taking so long, Pal-bong?

11:11.504 --> 11:12.463
Pal-bong.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.092
Pal-bong?

11:20.262 --> 11:22.681
Pal-bong. Pal-bong?

11:50.167 --> 11:52.378
Pal-bong, where are you?

11:53.170 --> 11:55.297
Where on earth are you? Come on.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.386
Pal-bong.

12:02.471 --> 12:05.307
Pal-bong! Pal-bong…

12:30.916 --> 12:33.919
-Pal-bong!
-Father.

12:35.045 --> 12:38.090
How could this happen?

12:40.634 --> 12:41.969
Gu-bong, did you see it?

12:42.553 --> 12:44.555
Did you see what did this to him?

12:51.103 --> 12:55.274
Listen. Four people from our village
either disappeared or died just this year.

12:55.816 --> 12:58.444
Seeing how his intestines are intact,

12:58.527 --> 13:00.488
a mountain animal did not do this.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.364
Neither did Jomagu or Mokgwang.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.825
All the blood in his body is gone.

13:04.909 --> 13:08.245
Then are you saying that thing killed him?
That thing was in the forest?

13:08.329 --> 13:09.830
What else, if not Bulgasal?

13:09.914 --> 13:11.332
-Bulgasal?
-Bulgasal?

13:11.415 --> 13:12.958
-Really?
-Oh, no.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.002
-Damn it.
-Should we leave then?

13:15.085 --> 13:16.670
What do we do?

13:16.754 --> 13:19.673
That boy…

13:21.342 --> 13:24.053
That cursed boy with no name.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.436
You called it here, didn't you?

14:33.706 --> 14:35.165
Hey, stop right there!

14:37.376 --> 14:39.044
I told you to stop!

15:03.319 --> 15:07.364
The villagers said
that you were cursed by Bulgasal.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.659
Even your own father ran away out of fear!

15:13.537 --> 15:16.790
Did Bulgasal really come
to this mountain to find you?

15:20.794 --> 15:23.255
Is that a "no"? Or do you not know?

15:26.508 --> 15:28.052
It is your fault!

15:28.135 --> 15:30.638
My father is dead because of you!

16:32.992 --> 16:37.371
<i>The villagers said
that you were cursed by Bulgasal.</i>

16:46.463 --> 16:50.050
<i>Did Bulgasal really come
to this mountain to find you?</i>

18:04.833 --> 18:06.502
What is it, Yeon-ji?

18:07.628 --> 18:11.757
I think something is over there.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.736
-Gil-deok…
-What happened?

19:05.060 --> 19:07.020
Lady!

19:10.732 --> 19:12.818
-Goodness.
-Yeon-ji…

19:18.991 --> 19:22.035
Pal-bong's wife and kids

19:23.287 --> 19:24.621
are all dead.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.207
-Oh, no!
-Yeon-ji is dead too?

19:27.291 --> 19:28.625
-Goodness.
-This is awful.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.879
Oh, no. What do we do?

19:40.012 --> 19:41.138
It is here.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.767
It has come…

19:47.686 --> 19:50.022
all the way to this village.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.316
It even went inside their house!

19:52.900 --> 19:56.069
It is looking for the boy
that has crossed it in his previous life.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.239
Are you sure Bulgasal did this to them?

19:59.865 --> 20:03.243
Yes. Until Bulgasal finds the boy,

20:04.411 --> 20:07.331
it will come knocking
on your doors every night.

20:11.084 --> 20:12.377
Now…

20:13.337 --> 20:18.175
everyone in this village will die!

20:18.258 --> 20:20.219
-Oh, no!
-What do we do?

20:24.640 --> 20:26.767
Hey, Gu-bong. Where are you going?

20:29.895 --> 20:32.022
That is…

20:33.065 --> 20:36.735
We must kill that boy.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.530
Kill him?

20:41.573 --> 20:43.158
-We will kill him!
-Yes!

20:58.215 --> 21:00.717
Damn it. Where is he hiding?

21:00.801 --> 21:02.427
Where is that rat?

21:03.011 --> 21:05.514
-We should have killed him ages ago!
-Where is he?

21:07.683 --> 21:09.601
There he is! He is running away!

21:10.185 --> 21:11.395
-He is getting away!
-Hey!

21:11.478 --> 21:12.896
-Stop!
-Get him!

21:14.064 --> 21:15.857
Stop right there!

21:18.819 --> 21:20.195
-I said stop!
-Get him!

21:46.680 --> 21:48.598
-Be careful.
-Come here!

21:49.891 --> 21:52.519
Hey! Come here!

21:52.602 --> 21:54.980
-Get him!
-You go after him!

21:55.063 --> 21:56.606
He is getting away!

21:56.690 --> 21:58.191
We have to kill him!

22:02.904 --> 22:06.074
-What is that noise?
-Go get him!

22:06.658 --> 22:09.453
-Damn it.
-The ice…

22:42.110 --> 22:43.445
That cursed boy.

22:46.114 --> 22:47.407
Hey.

22:48.325 --> 22:51.703
Take this and leave.
Stay away from the village for now.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.288
Something terrible has happened!

22:53.371 --> 22:55.290
I thought you were mute. Are you deaf too?

22:55.373 --> 22:57.876
Did you see anything? Answer me!

22:57.959 --> 22:59.461
<i>Why are you helping that bastard?</i>

22:59.544 --> 23:01.922
<i>He has been cursed by Bulgasal!</i>

23:11.765 --> 23:15.477
<i>What choice do I have? His father
left him with me for a bottle of liquor.</i>

24:58.496 --> 24:59.873
-Over there!
-Hey.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.791
-Get him!
-Get him!

25:20.352 --> 25:21.853
Move aside!

25:24.439 --> 25:26.775
We must protect our families
from Bulgasal.

25:26.858 --> 25:29.694
-Yes!
-You have to die in order for us to live!

26:10.777 --> 26:12.404
No…

26:18.285 --> 26:20.620
No!

26:22.580 --> 26:25.542
What? This bastard can speak!

26:25.625 --> 26:29.087
No!

26:29.671 --> 26:31.756
No…

26:38.096 --> 26:40.307
Come on. Let us end this.

26:40.390 --> 26:41.683
-Right.
-Kill him.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.977
-We must kill him.
-Come here!

27:03.621 --> 27:04.789
Halt.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.016
Mind your own business. Just go.

27:23.600 --> 27:26.353
We are taking care
of our own matters so just go!

27:26.436 --> 27:28.730
You are speaking
to General Dan Geuk of Goryeo.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.106
Show him your respect.

27:40.033 --> 27:43.578
A group of men is trying
to slaughter a child.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.000
Japanese pirates raid our lands,

27:49.084 --> 27:51.503
and Monsters attack our people.

27:51.586 --> 27:54.964
Those with power are interested
in only filling their own stomachs.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.426
But why are commoners like you
committing such a vile act?

28:00.053 --> 28:01.346
What is the reason for this?

28:03.014 --> 28:06.434
It is because
he has been cursed by Bulgasal.

28:07.936 --> 28:11.898
As Bulgasal has a grudge against him,
it has come down to our village

28:12.524 --> 28:15.985
and harmed our villagers in search of him.

28:16.861 --> 28:20.865
Even his own father abandoned him
out of fear, but we took him in.

28:20.949 --> 28:22.784
So this is our burden to carry.

28:22.867 --> 28:25.620
Please turn a blind eye to it.

28:36.214 --> 28:38.216
Killing a boy because of some Monster

28:38.299 --> 28:40.927
is nonsense to me
and I shall not believe it.

28:41.511 --> 28:45.056
I want to behead all of you right now.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.767
But I have seen

28:48.852 --> 28:50.812
too much blood on the battlefield today.

28:56.109 --> 28:57.819
What is your name?

28:57.902 --> 28:59.654
I do not…

29:00.822 --> 29:04.743
have a name.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.494
Is that so?

29:09.038 --> 29:10.749
Then from this moment on,

29:11.708 --> 29:13.793
your name shall be Hwal.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.004
Hwal.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.964
It means rebirth.

30:11.559 --> 30:13.269
I will take the boy with me.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.617
You will regret this.

30:28.201 --> 30:32.163
You will also get sucked
into his bad karma.

30:32.247 --> 30:36.167
Anyone who stays
by his side will throw up blood

30:36.251 --> 30:38.878
and dirt will get in their eyes.

30:39.379 --> 30:40.964
Not even you

30:42.006 --> 30:45.802
can avoid the curse of Bulgasal, General.

30:47.387 --> 30:53.601
The curse of Bulgasal
will not end until the boy dies.

30:59.774 --> 31:00.942
Let's go.

31:04.404 --> 31:05.530
But…

31:07.574 --> 31:14.372
<i>The curse of Bulgasal
will not end until the boy dies.</i>

31:22.547 --> 31:27.218
17 YEARS LATER, EARLY JOSEON

31:50.533 --> 31:53.286
Leave it. I can pour it myself.

31:58.082 --> 32:01.836
You spent your entire life
hunting Monsters for our kingdom

32:02.670 --> 32:04.589
and even sacrificed
your arm for the cause.

32:04.672 --> 32:07.967
It is time to leave the battlefield
and hold a position in an office now.

32:08.885 --> 32:11.095
I am not cut out for a position like that.

32:11.179 --> 32:14.349
The thought of working
in an office gives me the chills.

32:15.308 --> 32:19.187
I am sure you have many soldiers
you can rely on and entrust this task to.

32:20.521 --> 32:24.859
There is only one person
that I can entrust this task with.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.781
It is my adopted son.

32:29.864 --> 32:32.784
I taught him everything he knows
ever since he was a boy.

32:32.867 --> 32:36.287
But his military arts and bravery
have already surpassed mine.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.830
I heard about him.

32:37.914 --> 32:39.415
People said Bulgasal cursed him,

32:39.499 --> 32:42.669
but now, he is considered
to have been blessed by Bulgasal.

32:42.752 --> 32:45.171
Teoreokson, the water Monster
of Yongsan River,

32:45.254 --> 32:47.632
and Gapsangoe, the Monster
of Mount Gap that killed many people,

32:47.715 --> 32:49.217
<i>all died at the hands of my son.</i>

32:50.802 --> 32:53.680
<i>Those Monsters must fear him
as much as they fear Bulgasal.</i>

32:54.389 --> 32:56.307
And my soldiers call him

32:56.391 --> 32:58.935
the evil spirit who kills Monsters.

33:03.439 --> 33:04.983
I would like to end

33:05.984 --> 33:08.778
this Monster hunt together with my son.

33:23.835 --> 33:27.088
I do not see any activity
in the forest, General.

33:29.841 --> 33:30.967
Over there.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.886
I can feel evil energy from there.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.556
It will show itself soon.

33:38.558 --> 33:41.185
It is the last Monster
in the kingdom of Joseon.

33:42.186 --> 33:44.731
This long battle will finally end today.

33:49.652 --> 33:50.862
<i>I support that, General.</i>

33:50.945 --> 33:54.574
Monsters have always revealed
themselves in times of hardship.

33:55.950 --> 33:58.327
Now that we are welcoming
the new era of Joseon,

33:58.411 --> 34:02.165
the Monsters must vanish with Goryeo
as they are both remnants of the past.

34:03.750 --> 34:07.545
<i>Please fulfill your duty of hunting down
the Monsters until there are none left.</i>

34:25.813 --> 34:26.856
Hey.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.400
What is that?

34:30.777 --> 34:31.986
What the…

35:07.105 --> 35:08.356
What are you doing?

35:42.181 --> 35:45.434
Over here! The Dueoksini is here!

35:45.518 --> 35:46.602
Halt!

35:47.186 --> 35:48.813
We are your fellow soldiers! Stop!

35:50.398 --> 35:51.983
It is Dueoksini!

35:52.066 --> 35:54.110
It can rule over your thoughts!

35:54.193 --> 35:56.195
Do not let it deceive you!

37:17.985 --> 37:20.738
The Dueoksini has revealed its true form!

38:35.062 --> 38:36.939
<i>You will pay for this.</i>

38:37.023 --> 38:40.985
<i>I will remember your soul
and I will get my revenge.</i>

39:06.969 --> 39:09.096
He killed Dueoksini!

39:09.180 --> 39:12.099
The Commander has killed Dueoksini!

39:12.183 --> 39:16.020
- Hwal!
- Hwal!

39:16.103 --> 39:20.858
- Hwal!
- Hwal!

39:43.839 --> 39:46.384
They should be buried in their hometown.
Must it be here?

39:47.468 --> 39:50.262
It is the law to burn anyone
who was murdered by the Monsters.

39:50.846 --> 39:52.515
But the Monster did not kill them.

39:54.100 --> 39:55.810
We did.

39:56.936 --> 39:59.563
We wielded our swords
against our comrades and killed them.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.399
We are no different from the Monsters.

40:02.858 --> 40:04.151
No.

40:05.277 --> 40:06.862
He is the real Monster.

40:08.364 --> 40:09.740
Look at him.

40:09.824 --> 40:12.701
The deaths of these soldiers
do not bother him at all.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.662
He only cares about killing the Monsters.

40:14.745 --> 40:16.038
He was born to kill.

40:16.122 --> 40:18.499
But if it were not for him,
we would have all died.

40:18.582 --> 40:20.251
He is of lowly birth!

40:20.334 --> 40:22.962
He has been cursed by an evil spirit.

40:25.840 --> 40:29.009
How could people
of high status like us be under him?

40:29.969 --> 40:32.304
I cannot accept this.

40:55.911 --> 40:57.663
What are you doing here alone?

40:59.331 --> 41:00.499
It is nothing.

41:09.008 --> 41:10.926
No, this wound is serious.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.055
Blessed by Bulgasal? How ridiculous.

41:15.806 --> 41:18.184
Your life is hanging by a thread.
Be careful.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.896
This is pathetic.
Why are you doing this alone?

41:21.979 --> 41:23.564
Your subordinates can help you.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.483
I prefer to do it alone.

41:26.108 --> 41:28.444
They are scared of me
like they are of Monsters.

41:32.948 --> 41:35.201
You must learn to get along with others.

41:35.284 --> 41:37.578
You need people on your side to succeed.

41:37.661 --> 41:40.206
I have never been interested in success.

41:40.289 --> 41:41.582
There you go again.

41:42.166 --> 41:45.669
That is not something
I ought to hear from my only son.

41:46.337 --> 41:50.341
I will be done
once we get rid of all the Monsters.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.013
What is on your mind?

42:00.017 --> 42:04.480
I heard Monsters get their revenge
once they hold a grudge against you.

42:04.563 --> 42:07.650
Then are you worried that all the Monsters

42:07.733 --> 42:10.945
you killed in this life
will take revenge in your next life?

42:16.992 --> 42:18.285
I wish…

42:21.580 --> 42:23.707
not to be born again.

42:25.876 --> 42:27.503
If that scares you

42:28.504 --> 42:32.258
be born as my real son in your next life.

42:34.134 --> 42:36.095
I will protect you, my son.

42:41.058 --> 42:43.561
You saved this old man's life.

42:44.645 --> 42:46.355
Had you not saved me then,

42:46.981 --> 42:50.776
I would have been eaten
by Teoreokson and come out as its feces.

42:55.155 --> 42:58.367
Anyway, we ought to indulge ourselves
with some smiles today.

42:58.450 --> 43:00.578
The last Monster on this land is gone now.

43:04.039 --> 43:05.291
Not yet.

43:06.959 --> 43:08.544
There is one Monster left.

43:10.129 --> 43:11.714
Are you talking about Bulgasal?

43:14.008 --> 43:15.801
People say

43:15.884 --> 43:19.555
Bulgasal sucks human blood
and destroys souls.

43:19.638 --> 43:23.559
But as it has no soul,
it cannot be killed.

43:25.102 --> 43:26.103
However…

43:27.062 --> 43:28.105
it does not exist.

43:28.772 --> 43:32.192
Their fear of Monsters created a Monster
that is far scarier than the rest.

43:32.860 --> 43:35.571
No one has seen it in person.

43:35.654 --> 43:36.697
That is because…

43:40.326 --> 43:42.119
anyone who sees Bulgasal

43:44.038 --> 43:45.748
meets their fate.

43:48.125 --> 43:50.336
<i>The curse of Bulgasal</i>

43:51.003 --> 43:55.215
<i>will not end until the boy dies.</i>

43:56.800 --> 43:58.177
Hwal.

44:01.680 --> 44:03.599
Bulgasal does not exist.

44:04.141 --> 44:06.477
We are done hunting Monsters as of today.

44:06.560 --> 44:09.647
You must let go
of your past with Bulgasal.

44:12.733 --> 44:13.817
All right?

44:22.660 --> 44:26.622
General, we have received
an urgent message from your home.

44:45.641 --> 44:46.892
My lady.

45:02.282 --> 45:04.493
The baby came out prematurely.

45:04.576 --> 45:06.495
She has been like this for half a month.

45:18.090 --> 45:21.969
No. Give it back. That is my baby…

45:26.014 --> 45:27.057
It is your fault.

45:28.725 --> 45:32.354
My baby did not cry because of your curse.

45:36.275 --> 45:39.027
-She is not to leave her room.
-Yes, my lord.

45:39.820 --> 45:42.072
Father.

45:42.156 --> 45:45.033
Give back my baby. Father!

45:45.117 --> 45:46.118
My baby.

45:46.201 --> 45:47.327
Father!

45:48.120 --> 45:49.371
Father!

45:50.914 --> 45:53.459
-Father!
-I apologize

45:54.668 --> 45:56.336
for my daughter.

45:56.962 --> 45:58.213
Let me…

45:59.590 --> 46:02.718
My baby!

46:03.844 --> 46:04.887
Let me take the baby.

46:59.858 --> 47:01.235
Father.

47:02.819 --> 47:04.071
The baby…

47:05.656 --> 47:07.950
The baby is dead, right?

47:09.034 --> 47:11.537
I did not hear the baby cry…

47:13.747 --> 47:15.082
so I figured so.

47:23.257 --> 47:24.341
Father.

47:25.175 --> 47:28.929
Let me touch the baby before you bury her.

47:30.472 --> 47:32.015
Let me say goodbye

47:33.267 --> 47:35.519
to my sister.

48:05.007 --> 48:05.966
Father.

48:14.516 --> 48:15.809
<i>It is your fault.</i>

48:15.892 --> 48:18.478
<i>My baby did not cry because of your curse.</i>

48:18.562 --> 48:22.608
<i>Anyone who stays
by his side will throw up blood</i>

48:22.691 --> 48:25.402
<i>and dirt will get in their eyes.</i>

48:32.326 --> 48:33.994
The curse of Bulgasal.

48:36.288 --> 48:37.414
Father.

48:42.294 --> 48:43.587
Father…

48:47.716 --> 48:48.884
Father!

48:50.594 --> 48:52.387
Father!

48:56.308 --> 49:00.604
<i>Once it has a grudge against someone,
it will chase their soul to the end.</i>

49:33.512 --> 49:34.888
What are you doing?

49:35.389 --> 49:36.640
You will only hurt yourself.

49:37.224 --> 49:39.017
You are not well. This is dangerous.

49:41.311 --> 49:43.647
I am saving my children from your curse.

49:44.231 --> 49:45.816
My children are ill because of you

49:45.899 --> 49:47.776
and you killed one at birth.

49:47.859 --> 49:49.319
You killed her.

49:52.614 --> 49:54.574
Had it not been for my father,

49:54.658 --> 49:57.494
I would not have married
a man who has been cursed by Bulgasal.

50:02.541 --> 50:03.792
What are you doing?

50:05.335 --> 50:06.503
"The curse of Bulgasal."

50:07.713 --> 50:09.297
I heard that all my life.

50:09.381 --> 50:12.092
It was the first thing I learned to say.

50:13.009 --> 50:14.970
I heard it when I was abandoned…

50:16.888 --> 50:19.850
<i>and when the villagers
showed hatred against me.</i>

50:23.061 --> 50:25.147
I wished I had never been born.

50:26.106 --> 50:29.359
I always wanted to die.

50:32.863 --> 50:34.364
Then you should have.

50:35.282 --> 50:38.118
Why did you drag
my children into your curse?

50:38.201 --> 50:39.661
Why did you marry me?

50:40.370 --> 50:42.164
You do not even have any feelings.

50:42.748 --> 50:44.332
Was it because my father made you?

50:46.418 --> 50:48.170
Because you and I are the same.

50:52.340 --> 50:55.552
You are a monster just like me.

50:57.512 --> 50:58.722
A monster…

51:10.484 --> 51:12.277
Father!

51:22.204 --> 51:24.039
<i>You know it too.</i>

51:24.122 --> 51:25.749
Everyone in the Capital

51:25.832 --> 51:29.419
and even the servants in our home
consider you different and fear you.

51:36.092 --> 51:37.177
Give me your hand.

51:39.638 --> 51:40.972
You do not need that.

51:44.518 --> 51:45.519
It is all right.

52:13.088 --> 52:14.381
What are you doing?

52:16.424 --> 52:19.427
You see things others cannot see
and things you should not see.

52:19.511 --> 52:22.722
All right. What do you see now?

52:52.085 --> 52:54.212
I saw the woman who saved you.

52:55.213 --> 52:57.424
The woman you keep remembering.

53:00.176 --> 53:01.094
Let go of me.

53:03.930 --> 53:05.682
We are both cursed.

53:06.308 --> 53:08.351
However, I will break my own curse.

53:09.227 --> 53:11.271
I will go after Bulgasal.

53:11.354 --> 53:12.981
I will end this curse.

53:15.358 --> 53:17.527
You will die before that happens.

53:18.820 --> 53:20.113
Do as you please.

53:26.620 --> 53:28.288
I will take A-chan with me.

53:29.372 --> 53:31.458
Only then can I break
the curse of Bulgasal.

53:38.089 --> 53:39.215
<i>Never.</i>

53:39.299 --> 53:41.051
Do you want our son to die too?

53:41.134 --> 53:44.220
He will not die. I will protect him.

53:49.851 --> 53:52.312
<i>A-chan is carrying my curse.</i>

53:53.688 --> 53:56.399
<i>I will free him from it no matter what.</i>

54:12.248 --> 54:13.708
The soldiers are here. Hey!

54:13.792 --> 54:15.001
The soldiers are here.

54:15.085 --> 54:17.712
Goodness. What is going on? Oh, no.

54:18.713 --> 54:20.924
What do we do? Oh, no.

54:32.018 --> 54:33.520
What brings you here?

54:35.563 --> 54:38.066
<i>Bulgasal came here for him.</i>

54:38.149 --> 54:40.193
He is going to get us all killed!

54:40.777 --> 54:42.862
<i>-We must kill him to save ourselves.
-Kill him.</i>

54:42.946 --> 54:44.906
-Kill him.
-Die!

54:48.284 --> 54:50.954
Why is that boy tied up?

55:10.807 --> 55:12.600
He is not from here.

55:12.684 --> 55:15.478
He tried to steal our food.
So we beat him and tied him up.

55:15.562 --> 55:19.691
He seems to be a violent barbarian.
You saw him, did you not?

55:19.774 --> 55:20.817
-Yes.
-Of course.

55:20.900 --> 55:21.943
What did the boy say?

55:23.111 --> 55:25.363
They captured him when he was passing by.

55:25.447 --> 55:27.365
They were going to offer him to a Monster.

55:27.949 --> 55:30.827
So you were going
to make a human sacrifice to a Monster?

55:30.910 --> 55:34.914
If we do not offer human sacrifices,
Bulgasal will be enraged.

55:34.998 --> 55:38.043
And Bulgasal will kill all of us!

55:38.835 --> 55:41.004
So is it true that
you kill people for Bulgasal

55:41.087 --> 55:43.590
and worship that Monster?

55:43.673 --> 55:47.552
No one helped us because we are
slash-and-burn farmers, living in hiding!

55:47.635 --> 55:49.345
We were trying to save ourselves!

55:49.429 --> 55:51.514
Please just go on your way!

55:51.598 --> 55:55.143
-Go!
-Go!

55:56.102 --> 55:59.189
-Go!
-Leave!

56:08.573 --> 56:10.116
It is him!

56:10.909 --> 56:13.119
He is the one.

56:14.621 --> 56:18.083
He will bring Bulgasal here.

56:20.502 --> 56:22.587
Bulgasal will kill

56:23.171 --> 56:25.965
everyone here.

56:26.883 --> 56:30.220
Everyone's blood,

56:30.303 --> 56:35.975
flesh, and organs
will be spread all over the ground.

56:38.561 --> 56:41.940
That man will bring Bulgasal here

56:42.023 --> 56:45.068
and get all of us killed.

56:45.151 --> 56:46.569
-No!
-What?

56:47.445 --> 56:49.864
-That man…
-We are all going to die.

56:50.365 --> 56:51.658
Oh, no.

56:53.535 --> 56:55.578
I am here to kill Bulgasal.

56:55.662 --> 56:58.039
Anyone who stands in my way

56:58.123 --> 57:00.542
-No.
-will be beheaded on the spot.

57:02.335 --> 57:04.462
-We will hunt for it in the mountains.
-No.

57:04.546 --> 57:06.589
-No.
-No. He cannot.

57:06.673 --> 57:08.800
-Who told you to do that?
-You cannot do that!

57:15.473 --> 57:17.684
No, you cannot!

57:18.434 --> 57:20.854
-Stop them!
-No! We will all die!

57:20.937 --> 57:23.481
-No!
-We must stop them.

57:23.565 --> 57:25.191
You will get all of us killed!

57:25.275 --> 57:27.819
Do you think Bulgasal will let us live?

57:28.570 --> 57:30.780
<i>He should have never been born.</i>

57:32.282 --> 57:35.368
<i>He should have died then.</i>

57:47.630 --> 57:48.715
Commander.

57:49.424 --> 57:51.384
Are you sure that monster is here?

57:52.886 --> 57:53.887
Yes.

57:54.554 --> 57:57.807
It is only a rumor
that those peasants believe.

57:57.891 --> 57:59.559
Bulgasal never existed--

57:59.642 --> 58:01.936
I know because
I used to be one of those peasants.

58:03.354 --> 58:04.606
It is here.

58:30.340 --> 58:32.258
Ambush!

58:54.113 --> 58:58.701
If you anger Bulgasal, all of us will die!

59:01.204 --> 59:03.748
Do not kill him. He is a mere villager.

59:03.831 --> 59:06.167
They are armed
and refused to follow orders.

59:06.251 --> 59:08.628
Look over there. You cannot stop them now.

1:01:01.115 --> 1:01:04.160
You did not die that day.

1:01:05.787 --> 1:01:07.205
You did not age either.

1:01:11.668 --> 1:01:12.669
You are…

1:01:20.259 --> 1:01:22.178
You are Bulgasal.

1:01:46.119 --> 1:01:48.162
-Halt!
-That way!

1:01:54.502 --> 1:01:57.880
Are you all right?
You suddenly stood in the way.

1:01:57.964 --> 1:01:59.173
Who was that?

1:02:03.136 --> 1:02:05.221
We are descending
the mountain immediately!

1:02:53.811 --> 1:02:54.854
It is all right.

1:02:56.773 --> 1:02:58.191
It is fine.

1:02:59.942 --> 1:03:02.820
I am sorry about my eyes.

1:03:02.904 --> 1:03:04.822
Stop saying that.

1:03:04.906 --> 1:03:05.907
Mother.

1:03:07.116 --> 1:03:11.370
Father does not like me
because of my eyes, right?

1:03:13.289 --> 1:03:14.457
He hates me, right?

1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:17.543
He has never

1:03:18.586 --> 1:03:21.464
let me stay by his side.

1:03:23.174 --> 1:03:25.843
I have never held Father's hand.

1:03:28.429 --> 1:03:30.932
And I have never touched his face.

1:03:32.683 --> 1:03:34.227
I do not know

1:03:35.228 --> 1:03:36.771
how he looks

1:03:37.980 --> 1:03:39.398
when I can picture

1:03:40.983 --> 1:03:42.443
your face so well.

1:03:50.117 --> 1:03:54.080
It is because of my eyes.

1:03:57.124 --> 1:03:58.417
No.

1:04:00.086 --> 1:04:01.420
It is not your fault.

1:04:16.310 --> 1:04:18.354
<i>I will free our son from the curse.</i>

1:04:19.313 --> 1:04:21.148
<i>You will free A-chan from the curse?</i>

1:04:22.024 --> 1:04:26.279
When you have never embraced him?
Not even once in his life?

1:04:26.863 --> 1:04:29.907
You hate him. You fear him.

1:04:30.908 --> 1:04:31.993
He…

1:04:33.703 --> 1:04:37.290
He reminded me of my curse.

1:04:38.249 --> 1:04:40.042
You do not deserve to be his father.

1:04:41.252 --> 1:04:42.503
<i>The last thing I do</i>

1:04:43.713 --> 1:04:45.756
<i>will be what a father ought to do.</i>

1:04:46.799 --> 1:04:48.426
<i>The curse of Bulgasal.</i>

1:04:50.386 --> 1:04:52.388
I will settle Bulgasal's grudge.

1:04:54.098 --> 1:04:55.975
Then the curse will be broken.

1:04:57.018 --> 1:04:58.811
<i>You will settle Bulgasal's grudge?</i>

1:04:58.895 --> 1:05:02.273
And it will kill me for sure.

1:05:03.065 --> 1:05:05.359
<i>If I can free A-chan from the curse,</i>

1:05:06.444 --> 1:05:08.279
<i>I will accept my death time after time.</i>

1:05:19.999 --> 1:05:22.335
<i>Where are you, Bulgasal?</i>

1:05:23.502 --> 1:05:24.837
<i>Show yourself.</i>

1:05:31.177 --> 1:05:33.721
<i>Why did you save me?</i>

1:05:35.848 --> 1:05:37.266
Bulgasal.

1:05:40.311 --> 1:05:42.939
What is it that you really want from me?

1:05:55.034 --> 1:05:56.243
What's wrong?

1:05:57.662 --> 1:05:59.038
I feel dizzy.

1:06:00.247 --> 1:06:01.374
What?

1:06:03.250 --> 1:06:05.378
Come on.

1:06:06.504 --> 1:06:08.506
How could you be so frail?

1:06:38.536 --> 1:06:40.287
Bulgasal…

1:07:13.821 --> 1:07:16.323
It is sucking human blood.

1:07:17.825 --> 1:07:19.076
Listen up.

1:07:19.994 --> 1:07:21.370
We will attack it together.

1:07:54.737 --> 1:07:58.407
Mother, what is going on outside?

1:08:01.660 --> 1:08:02.745
A beast…

1:08:02.828 --> 1:08:04.747
I can hear a beast.

1:08:07.750 --> 1:08:10.920
That way! The Monster is there!

1:08:16.926 --> 1:08:19.095
Help me!

1:09:13.023 --> 1:09:16.360
Mother. Where are we going?

1:09:16.443 --> 1:09:18.362
I am scared!

1:09:21.198 --> 1:09:24.743
Your father will come and save us.
Wait just a little bit, my child.

1:09:49.059 --> 1:09:50.269
Mother.

1:09:54.148 --> 1:09:56.984
Turn around and run now.

1:09:57.067 --> 1:09:58.819
Run and find your father.

1:10:00.654 --> 1:10:01.697
Hurry!

1:10:03.949 --> 1:10:05.075
Mother.

1:10:19.256 --> 1:10:20.507
Father!

1:10:21.133 --> 1:10:22.384
Father!

1:10:23.010 --> 1:10:24.345
Father!

1:10:27.348 --> 1:10:29.516
Father!

1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:31.393
Father!

1:10:31.477 --> 1:10:32.853
Father!

1:10:45.616 --> 1:10:46.992
Father!

1:10:47.534 --> 1:10:48.869
Father!

1:10:49.745 --> 1:10:51.163
Father!

1:10:51.789 --> 1:10:53.123
Father!

1:11:32.955 --> 1:11:34.206
A-chan.

1:11:36.125 --> 1:11:37.876
Father…

1:11:40.629 --> 1:11:43.215
Yes, my son.

1:11:43.841 --> 1:11:45.426
What about Mother?

1:12:05.029 --> 1:12:06.322
She is all right.

1:12:06.947 --> 1:12:08.782
I am glad to hear that.

1:12:09.992 --> 1:12:11.744
Father.

1:12:13.579 --> 1:12:14.955
I…

1:12:17.041 --> 1:12:18.542
do not know

1:12:19.501 --> 1:12:22.921
your face.

1:12:25.049 --> 1:12:26.842
-Your face…
-Stop talking.

1:12:27.843 --> 1:12:29.303
Your face…

1:12:31.597 --> 1:12:33.098
Your face…

1:12:36.018 --> 1:12:37.478
Father…

1:12:57.414 --> 1:12:59.124
My son.

1:13:01.210 --> 1:13:02.461
No.

1:13:05.130 --> 1:13:06.215
No…

1:13:11.929 --> 1:13:13.055
No.

1:13:17.059 --> 1:13:18.102
No…

1:13:19.728 --> 1:13:20.896
No…

1:13:35.077 --> 1:13:36.203
No.

1:13:37.830 --> 1:13:38.997
No…

1:13:41.834 --> 1:13:43.085
<i>Father.</i>

1:13:49.383 --> 1:13:50.843
Father.

1:13:55.180 --> 1:13:56.140
Father.

1:14:03.605 --> 1:14:04.940
A-chan.

1:14:15.617 --> 1:14:17.453
<i>I should have held</i>

1:14:18.245 --> 1:14:20.080
<i>my son's hand.</i>

1:14:36.680 --> 1:14:38.265
<i>I should have embraced him.</i>

1:16:29.042 --> 1:16:31.211
<i>GOKOK</i>: SOUL

1:17:54.670 --> 1:17:58.382
<i>I will be born again
with this scar that you have given me.</i>

1:17:59.174 --> 1:18:01.843
<i>Is it true that you have become Bulgasal?</i>

1:18:01.927 --> 1:18:03.470
<i>Please kill me.</i>

1:18:04.054 --> 1:18:05.764
<i>What has happened to that woman?</i>

1:18:07.516 --> 1:18:11.687
She will reincarnate as a human.

1:18:14.398 --> 1:18:15.941
<i>Hide in here. Hurry.</i>

1:18:16.024 --> 1:18:18.068
<i>-No.
-We have no time.</i>

1:18:18.652 --> 1:18:20.529
