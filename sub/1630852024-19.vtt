00:03.046 --> 00:04.221
<i>The first thing</i> <i>
that happened</i> <i>
after the wedding,</i>

00:04.265 --> 00:06.528
<i>is the living buried</i> <i>
their dead.</i>

00:06.571 --> 00:09.661
<i>Among the firstborns</i> <i>
who'd perished as a result</i> <i>
of Percival's attack,</i>

00:09.705 --> 00:13.056
<i>Archie, Toni, Fangs,</i> <i>
Dagwood, Nana Rose, and me,</i>

00:13.100 --> 00:14.101
<i>your humble narrator.</i>

00:15.102 --> 00:16.320
So sorry to intrude.

00:16.364 --> 00:19.149
We've, um, we've come
to pay our respects.

00:19.193 --> 00:23.893
You... you did this.
You killed my Nana...

00:25.068 --> 00:26.678
and my T.T.

00:26.722 --> 00:30.900
How could you?
How could you do this?
Anthony was a baby.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.075
Calm yourselves.

00:32.119 --> 00:35.252
We'll leave.
Leave you to your grief.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.256
<i>I'll let you in</i> <i>
on a secret.</i>

00:39.300 --> 00:41.693
<i>We weren't quite yet</i> <i>
worm food.</i>

00:41.737 --> 00:46.698
<i>This funeral, a misdirect,</i> <i>
to lull Percival into a false</i> <i>
sense of security.</i>

00:46.742 --> 00:51.225
<i>Oh, we were dead,</i> <i>
but our bodies were currently</i> <i>
in Dr. Curdle's deep freeze,</i>

00:51.268 --> 00:53.227
<i>preserved and not</i> <i>
yet decomposing.</i>

00:54.663 --> 00:56.230
- <i>
- The plan was simple.</i>

00:56.273 --> 00:57.883
<i>Convince Percival</i> <i>
we were six feet under</i>

00:57.927 --> 01:00.886
<i>while our surviving loved ones</i> <i>
mourned our passing,</i>

01:00.930 --> 01:04.194
<i>when in fact,</i> <i>
they were biding their time
until we could be resurrected.</i>

01:05.978 --> 01:08.242
<i>Reports are</i> <i>
still coming in,</i>

01:08.285 --> 01:10.200
<i>but authorities believe,</i> <i>
there was an altercation</i>

01:10.244 --> 01:13.334
<i>between rival gangs,
The Serpents and the Ghoulies,</i>

01:13.377 --> 01:15.205
<i>that has resulted</i> <i>
in multiple deaths</i>

01:15.249 --> 01:16.902
<i>at the Whyte Wyrm biker bar.</i>

01:16.946 --> 01:19.122
<i>Names of the deceased</i> <i>
have not yet been released,</i>

01:19.166 --> 01:20.645
<i>but local authorities</i> <i>
are warning--</i>

01:22.343 --> 01:24.345
Nice cover story, Mom.

01:24.388 --> 01:28.392
You know, maybe that's why
Percival didn't kill
every firstborn in town,

01:28.436 --> 01:30.046
because it would be much harder

01:30.090 --> 01:32.744
to explain away hundreds,
if not thousands of deaths.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.616
- That's a good point.
- When is she coming?

01:34.659 --> 01:37.488
- Sabrina-- What was her last name again?
- Spellman.

01:38.446 --> 01:40.317
She'll be here soon, right?

01:40.361 --> 01:42.189
As soon as she can be.

01:42.232 --> 01:45.366
Sabrina is the definition
of a multi-tasking witch.

01:45.409 --> 01:49.283
Cheerleader by day,
Queen of hell by night,
was her tagline for a while.

01:49.326 --> 01:53.156
But you said,
we only have three days
to bring them back?

01:53.200 --> 01:54.810
And we've got like,
12 hours left.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.290
It's true.

01:56.333 --> 01:59.380
There are different kinds
of resurrection rituals.

01:59.423 --> 02:02.948
The one we are attempting
must be performed within
three days of a person's...

02:03.340 --> 02:04.733
expiration.

02:04.776 --> 02:07.344
Otherwise, the body becomes
too corrupt to reanimate

02:07.388 --> 02:10.434
and the death
becomes permanent.

02:10.478 --> 02:13.698
At least it doesn't seem like
Percival suspects
what we're up to.

02:13.742 --> 02:17.311
And he doesn't know that
baby Anthony survived
his last plague.

02:17.354 --> 02:19.791
That gives us a tiny window
to bring everyone back

02:19.835 --> 02:21.184
in time for the final battle.

02:21.228 --> 02:23.099
Why did baby Anthony survive?

02:23.143 --> 02:25.188
Wouldn't he have been
Percival's main target?

02:25.232 --> 02:27.147
You were a firstborn, too,
though, Kev?

02:29.061 --> 02:31.107
<i>I think I know</i> <i>
why I'm alive, Betty,</i>

02:31.151 --> 02:34.371
because Percival wants
to punish me
for betraying him.

02:34.415 --> 02:38.288
What punishment is worse
than death by
a biblical plague?

02:38.332 --> 02:41.770
You don't know him like I do.
Which is why I'm leaving.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.685
I mean, even the fact
that I'm here
right now at Thornhill

02:43.728 --> 02:45.295
is probably putting you guys
in danger.

02:45.339 --> 02:46.383
Where will you go?

02:46.427 --> 02:47.950
New York.
Moose is already there.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.432
I'm sorry, Betty.

02:51.475 --> 02:53.260
I understand.
Everyone else will too.

03:00.745 --> 03:03.008
The Daggers of Megiddo.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.445
Well done, Reggie.

03:04.488 --> 03:07.099
Like so many of the items
in my collection,

03:07.143 --> 03:09.667
these blades contain
immense, arcane power.

03:11.147 --> 03:12.496
Now, did you enjoy your trip
to Rome?

03:12.540 --> 03:14.281
Everything, except for the part

03:14.324 --> 03:16.674
when I got home
and a bunch of my high
school friends were dead.

03:16.718 --> 03:19.634
Yeah, so unfortunate
how that all happened.

03:19.677 --> 03:23.464
But look,
there's a silver lining
to all this tragedy.

03:23.507 --> 03:26.118
Now that Veronica
has been so grief-stricken

03:26.162 --> 03:28.033
and absent from the casino
of late,

03:28.077 --> 03:31.123
I took the liberty of calling
an emergency board meeting

03:31.167 --> 03:37.129
and suggested that
you be installed as CEO,
effective immediately.

03:37.173 --> 03:38.435
Congratulations, Reg.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.176
Babylonium now belongs to you

03:41.308 --> 03:42.222
and you alone.

03:43.527 --> 03:45.486
<i>That was Mrs. Andrews.</i>

03:45.529 --> 03:47.270
She had a bad feeling
about Archie,

03:47.314 --> 03:50.882
so she keeps calling him
and he's not calling her back.

03:50.926 --> 03:52.884
- Obviously.
- Good God.

03:52.928 --> 03:54.930
What are we gonna tell her
happened to Archie,

03:54.973 --> 03:58.673
- if this crazy plan of ours doesn't work?
- It has to work.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.892
There's no other option.

04:00.936 --> 04:04.548
Guys, where do we think
they are?

04:04.592 --> 04:08.291
Archie and the others.
I mean their souls?

04:09.858 --> 04:11.860
In some kind of afterlife?

04:11.903 --> 04:16.430
Sabrina once described it
simply as the
"Sweet Hereafter."

04:19.084 --> 04:21.783
Kids, is there something
you want to tell your dad?

04:23.480 --> 04:25.177
We got our report cards today.

04:25.221 --> 04:26.657
Ah-huh.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.268
Let me guess, straight A's?

04:28.311 --> 04:29.356
Yep.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.183
We're very proud of you,
little Polly.

04:31.227 --> 04:32.489
What about you, big guy?

04:32.533 --> 04:36.101
Little Fred got A's
in gym and music,

04:36.145 --> 04:38.539
but cats and dogs
in everything else.

04:38.582 --> 04:41.281
That's okay.
You know, your old man

04:41.324 --> 04:43.413
wasn't the greatest
student either.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.415
That doesn't mean
we're not still proud of you.

04:45.459 --> 04:46.547
Okay, you'll find your way.

04:46.590 --> 04:47.417
Thanks, Pop.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.204

As of this moment,

Here's to a better, brighter,
more unified, Riverdale.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.127
For everyone.

05:45.170 --> 05:48.609

And for my Timmy as well.

Are you going somewhere, Son?

06:13.198 --> 06:15.723
You need to come with us.
Percival has a couple
of questions

06:15.766 --> 06:16.854
he'd like to ask you.

06:18.682 --> 06:19.857
Come on now.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.732
Dad, what are you up to?

06:24.775 --> 06:26.908
Well, why don't
I send you a car,

06:26.951 --> 06:30.520
you come to the casino
and roll some dice
with the Babylonium's

06:30.564 --> 06:32.392
newly ensconced CEO.

06:41.226 --> 06:42.837
You must be Sabrina Spellman.

06:42.880 --> 06:43.925
I'm Cheryl Blossom.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.666
Come in.
We've been waiting for you.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.145
Sorry it took me a minute.

06:47.189 --> 06:48.538
Lots of turbulence
in the realms.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.410
But, I'm here now.

06:51.628 --> 06:52.629
What can I do to help?

07:03.727 --> 07:04.815
It's lovely to meet you all.

07:04.859 --> 07:07.775
Even under such
dire circumstances.

07:07.818 --> 07:11.343
Sabrina is a fellow witch
who specializes in death magic.

07:11.387 --> 07:14.608
It's true. After I passed away
a few years ago,

07:14.651 --> 07:17.219
my boyfriend, Nick Scratch,
sacrificed himself,

07:17.262 --> 07:20.222
to bring me back from the dead
as a way to rebalance
the scales.

07:20.265 --> 07:23.486
Ironically, that experience,
being resurrected,

07:23.530 --> 07:26.271
is what made me decide
to specialize in necromancy.

07:27.316 --> 07:28.448
What happened to Nick?

07:29.753 --> 07:30.667
He had to stay behind...

07:31.407 --> 07:33.017
in the "Sweet Hereafter,"

07:33.061 --> 07:34.845
which, based on
what Heather told me

07:34.889 --> 07:36.673
is where your
significant others are.

07:36.717 --> 07:38.327
- Am I right?
- More or less.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.068
And they've been dead
two plus days?

07:40.111 --> 07:41.896
Yes, and counting.

07:42.940 --> 07:46.161
Okay, so, we'll need
to move fast.

07:46.204 --> 07:50.208
First, we'll need a coven
of at least six witches
to perform the resurrection.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.473
Okay. Well, you, me
and Heather, make three.

07:55.736 --> 07:59.914
Uh, unfortunately, Brujeria
wasn't one of my majors
at Barnard.

07:59.957 --> 08:02.569
Yeah, and I mix milkshakes,
not potions.

08:02.612 --> 08:05.572
None of us are...
We're not witches. Sorry.

08:05.615 --> 08:09.967
Not yet, but all powerful,
disruptive women,

08:10.011 --> 08:13.057
have the potential
to become witches.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.016
And you've already started
manifesting powers,

08:15.059 --> 08:18.715
from what I'm hearing,
so, let's make it official.

08:18.759 --> 08:19.934
Step one...

08:19.977 --> 08:22.763
You sign your name
in a book of witchcraft.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.329
The <i>Maleficarum</i> will do nicely.

08:31.641 --> 08:34.426
We pledge ourselves
to the Mother,

08:34.470 --> 08:36.559
to share our power
with one another.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.082
<i>Step two.</i>

08:38.126 --> 08:40.432
<i>You pledge allegiance</i> <i>
to Hecate.</i>

08:40.476 --> 08:43.653
<i>The feminine ideals</i> <i>
of maiden, mother, and crone.</i>

08:43.697 --> 08:46.830

09:13.988 --> 09:17.208
Welcome to the sisterhood
of night, ladies.

09:17.252 --> 09:20.777
Now that we've all been
blessed with the divine
spirit of Hecate,

09:20.821 --> 09:23.998
I suggest we do
a trial run focusing
on a single resurrection.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.522
Where are the bodies?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.219
- They're at the morgue. I can take you.
- Great.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.656
In the meantime,
the rest of you witches

09:29.699 --> 09:31.962
will need to conjure up
a portal.

09:32.006 --> 09:33.921
There's a passageway
to the "Sweet Hereafter."

09:34.661 --> 09:36.010
Let's see.

09:36.053 --> 09:37.794
Um... Right there, is good.

09:38.621 --> 09:40.449
Once we've got our corpse,

09:40.492 --> 09:44.584
I, as a certified death walker,
will cross over
into the afterlife

09:44.627 --> 09:46.847
and coax the soul
in question
back into their body.

09:46.890 --> 09:49.023
If that works,
we'll repeat the process,

09:49.066 --> 09:52.417
if it doesn't, we'll regroup.

09:52.461 --> 09:55.725
Now, do you have your own broom
or do you want to ride with me?

10:09.913 --> 10:11.175
You're on fire, Dad.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.483
Hey, you okay?

10:14.526 --> 10:15.702
Huh?

10:15.745 --> 10:17.878
Maybe we should slow down.
Your heart.

10:17.921 --> 10:19.619
It's nothing.
It's just a twitch.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.839
Come on, I'm hot.
I can't lose tonight.

10:23.710 --> 10:24.754
Good. Good. I'm good...

10:27.670 --> 10:28.845
Let's go.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.673
So, we've narrowed it down
to these two.

10:33.241 --> 10:34.808
They're both super cute.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.204
But there is something
about this one.

10:42.337 --> 10:43.468
We'll try him first.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.733
I can't promise you
a happy ending...

10:48.038 --> 10:50.084
once I find Jughead--

10:50.127 --> 10:51.825
Great name, by the way.

10:53.043 --> 10:56.786
I'll explain what happened,
but, then it's up to him.

10:56.830 --> 10:59.746
- Meaning?
- The dead have to want to return.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.574
I can't force him to come back.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.359
Can you just--

11:04.402 --> 11:07.144
Can you tell Jughead
that I miss him?

11:08.798 --> 11:10.974
I hear you, and you got it.

11:11.932 --> 11:12.933
Okay. Everyone ready?

11:53.190 --> 11:53.974
Hey, there.

11:55.018 --> 11:56.803
- Can I join you?
- Sure.

12:03.331 --> 12:04.680
You're a fan
of <i>Mad House Glads?</i>

12:06.116 --> 12:08.510
Um... I'm Sabrina Spellman.

12:08.553 --> 12:11.992
And while I don't really
have time to get
into the details,

12:12.035 --> 12:15.212
let's just say I'm visiting
from the mortal realm.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.040
We have some mutual friends,

12:17.084 --> 12:21.175
and uh, oh yeah... I'm a witch.

12:23.003 --> 12:26.267
You're not trying to take me
back there, are you?

12:26.310 --> 12:30.358
Essentially, yes.
Everyone misses you,
especially Tabitha.

12:31.620 --> 12:32.882
Yeah, and I miss her, too.

12:34.536 --> 12:36.277
I died, you know?

12:36.320 --> 12:37.582
Prematurely.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.541
Your work on Earth isn't done.

12:39.584 --> 12:42.936
The final battle,
which you are needed for,
hasn't happened.

12:42.979 --> 12:45.590
So, um... What do you say?

12:45.634 --> 12:48.898
Wanna settle that bill
and head back
to the land of the living?

12:52.119 --> 12:54.991
I'm good, you know...

12:55.035 --> 12:58.125
This is like the ideal version
of Riverdale.

12:58.168 --> 12:59.866
There's no suffering.

12:59.909 --> 13:04.479
Just endless burgers,
and comic books, and I...
I can hear again.

13:04.522 --> 13:08.048
I'm so much better off here,
in the "Sweet Hereafter."

13:08.091 --> 13:10.050
- You know?
- What about Tabitha?

13:10.093 --> 13:11.834
Well, eventually,
we'll see each other again.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.531
And she already told me
how all this ends,

13:13.575 --> 13:16.665
with us most likely
losing to Percival
and me dying again.

13:16.708 --> 13:17.492
And it's--

13:18.928 --> 13:20.060
What's the point?

13:20.103 --> 13:23.890
The point... is hope.

13:24.281 --> 13:25.065
Hm.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.765
What can I do or say
to convince you?

13:30.897 --> 13:31.680
Nothing.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.032
But tell Tabitha,
that I think about her...

13:37.729 --> 13:41.211
a lot... and I do hope
to see her soon.

13:42.038 --> 13:42.822
Not too soon though.

13:43.735 --> 13:44.519
Okay.

13:45.085 --> 13:45.868
Okay.

13:48.436 --> 13:52.005
Um... actually...

13:52.048 --> 13:54.877
Can I talk to you about something else?

13:56.226 --> 13:58.838
And maybe... ask a favor.

14:03.755 --> 14:06.367
You know, I was afraid
you were weak, Kevin.

14:06.410 --> 14:09.936
And, uh, well, sadly,
you've proved me right.

14:09.979 --> 14:15.376
Now, you're going
to tell me exactly
what shenanigans,

14:15.419 --> 14:17.944
your friends have been up to
at Thornhill.

14:25.952 --> 14:29.303
Never, never. Just kill me.

14:29.346 --> 14:30.304
Kill me.

14:30.347 --> 14:31.871
You know what, piggy?

14:32.436 --> 14:33.611
I just might.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.407
Jughead.

14:46.450 --> 14:50.106
Oh my God, Jughead.
I missed you so, so much.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.021
Thank God you're back.

14:54.806 --> 14:55.590
What is it?

14:56.939 --> 14:58.158
What's wrong?

14:58.201 --> 14:58.985
I'm not Jughead.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.902
What? Then who are you?

15:05.034 --> 15:08.081
Everyone, this is my boyfriend.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.300
Nick Scratch.

15:17.090 --> 15:21.050
So, wait, wait, wait.
Your boyfriend's soul
is in my boyfriend's body.

15:21.094 --> 15:22.138
Mm-hm.

15:23.531 --> 15:24.575
I'm Nick Scratch.

15:25.185 --> 15:26.360
What's up, ladies?

15:26.403 --> 15:28.231
Yeah, that's definitely
not Jughead.

15:28.275 --> 15:30.146
So then where
is my boyfriend, then?

15:31.321 --> 15:33.149
I asked if he wanted
to come back,

15:33.193 --> 15:35.760
and he politely declined.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.287
It makes sense, though,
doesn't it?

15:40.330 --> 15:41.766
I mean, think about it.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.812
Who wants to leave Heaven?

15:43.855 --> 15:46.162
So then, instead
you stole his body?

15:46.206 --> 15:50.514
I borrowed it
with Jughead's consent to...

15:50.558 --> 15:52.777
spend a little more time
with my Nick.

15:52.821 --> 15:55.780
But Nick is also a necromancer,

15:55.824 --> 15:57.130
and we're going
to need his help

15:57.173 --> 15:59.349
for our next attempt
to bring your friends back.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.612
Oh okay. Good.
So we're not giving up.

16:01.656 --> 16:03.005
Absolutely not.

16:03.049 --> 16:06.922
So loved ones of the dearly
departed... gear up.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.185
- Uh...
- Uh...

16:09.229 --> 16:13.407
You want us
to go into the great beyond?

16:13.450 --> 16:17.628
Your friends don't know me,
but if you guys,
the ones they love

16:17.672 --> 16:21.067
appeal to them emotionally,
they might come back.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.156
Right. But we're not necromancers.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.940
How are we going to cross over?

16:24.984 --> 16:27.812
I will summon Charon,
the ferryman of the dead

16:27.856 --> 16:29.423
in Greek mythology, to help.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.599
He's sort of a work friend.

16:31.642 --> 16:32.556
Whatever it takes.

16:34.080 --> 16:37.170
Good, because you're also
going to have to die.

16:37.213 --> 16:39.824
Temporarily, just for
a few minutes to cross over.

16:39.868 --> 16:43.480
Okay, um... I'll go for T.T.,

16:43.524 --> 16:47.267
obviously, and Fangs,
I suppose.

16:47.310 --> 16:49.530
- Oh, and my Nana and Dagwood.
- I'll go in for Jughead.

16:49.573 --> 16:50.792
I'll go in for Archie.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.104
Um... just one sec.

16:59.714 --> 17:01.933
- Yeah.
- What?

17:01.977 --> 17:04.545
- What is it?
- Um, uh, Betty?

17:04.588 --> 17:08.810
I'm not sure
what it is exactly,
but there's something

17:08.853 --> 17:12.727
about your energy
that we worry will keep you
from crossing over.

17:12.770 --> 17:14.294
Has anyone put a hex on you?

17:14.337 --> 17:16.774
- Damned your soul?
- No.

17:18.385 --> 17:21.779
I mean, recently I was likened
to the harlot of Babylon.

17:21.823 --> 17:24.086
Oh, yes. Totally. Um...

17:24.130 --> 17:27.002
Yeah. No. The harlot wouldn't
technically be allowed
into Heaven.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.048
- No.
- Oh. Okay.

17:29.091 --> 17:30.223
Well, that figures.

17:30.266 --> 17:33.139
Yeah, that's it. Um...

17:33.182 --> 17:35.837
Anyone else here
have an emotional connection
to Archie

17:35.880 --> 17:38.013
that might be able to lead him
back to the mortal realm?

17:43.192 --> 17:45.281
Sure. Yeah.

17:45.325 --> 17:48.371
Kill me temporarily
so I can go visit
my ex-boyfriend in Heaven.

17:49.677 --> 17:51.070
Why not?

17:51.113 --> 17:52.027
Great.

17:53.246 --> 17:54.290
This is gonna be awesome.

17:55.248 --> 17:57.032
Awesome.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.991
- You're enjoying that new found success, Reg.
- I'm not going to lie.

18:00.035 --> 18:01.819
It feels like it's been
a long time coming.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.257
That's wonderful.

18:04.300 --> 18:08.870
I'm so glad to hear that...
because I need a favor.

18:08.913 --> 18:13.657
I'm afraid Kevin Keller
has betrayed us and must
be punished accordingly.

18:13.701 --> 18:17.879
I'd like you to execute him
as a message to all those
who would oppose me.

18:17.922 --> 18:18.793
Are you for real?

18:21.056 --> 18:23.145
I've known Kevin
since we were rug rats.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.234
Afraid it's non-negotiable,
old chum.

18:25.278 --> 18:28.281
But look, I'm not a monster.

18:28.324 --> 18:30.152
You do this for me,
you'll be rewarded.

18:30.196 --> 18:33.938
Your father can have Kevin's
young, healthy heart.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.592
Oh yes,
I know all about
his health issues.

18:35.636 --> 18:37.159
His time is running out.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.204
He needs a miracle.

18:40.075 --> 18:41.903
Rather like
the one I'm offering.

18:41.946 --> 18:45.515
You punish Kevin as he deserves
and you save your father.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.909
There really
is no dilemma here.

18:51.304 --> 18:52.566
Is this going to hurt?

18:52.609 --> 18:53.958
Hopefully not.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.917
It should feel like
you're going to sleep.

18:55.960 --> 18:59.486
Personally, I'm excited.
How many people get to say
they died and came back?

19:00.356 --> 19:02.489
In Riverdale, a lot.

19:02.532 --> 19:06.493
Okay, people,
let's, let's focus. Nick.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.059
If you'll do the honors.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.237
With this incantation,

19:12.455 --> 19:14.370
hearts will beat in moderation.

19:15.763 --> 19:17.330
Rest your easy minds,

19:18.200 --> 19:21.247
slip away from space and time.

19:21.290 --> 19:24.380
Offer up these silver coins
to our ferryman divine.

19:33.346 --> 19:38.699
Dearest Charon,
hear our plea, for these souls
to go with thee.

19:40.483 --> 19:42.920
Our offerings
have been clearly set out,

19:44.226 --> 19:46.794
guide these souls
to the "Sweet hereafter,"

19:47.969 --> 19:48.926
or thereabout.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.363
Okay. What do we do now?

20:34.407 --> 20:35.799
Just hang out and wait?

20:35.843 --> 20:37.671
Yeah. Keep watch
over their bodies,

20:37.714 --> 20:39.238
make sure nothing bad
happens to them.

20:41.152 --> 20:45.592
But, in the meantime,
I was hoping Nick and I could

20:45.635 --> 20:47.158
sneak off for a quick date.

20:48.769 --> 20:50.640
Um, are there any yummy
places in town?

20:55.993 --> 20:56.994
- Ronnie.
- Archie.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.171
Oh, God.

21:00.215 --> 21:02.435
I wasn't sure
I'd ever see you again.

21:02.478 --> 21:03.827
What are you
talking about?

21:03.871 --> 21:05.568
- You live right down the road.
- Uh...

21:05.612 --> 21:08.136
Archie, I'm am not
that Veronica.

21:08.179 --> 21:11.966
I'm the Veronica
from before you died.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.580
The war is still
happening, Archie.

21:17.624 --> 21:19.843
Back in the real world
or the mortal plane,

21:19.887 --> 21:21.149
whatever you want to call it.

21:21.192 --> 21:22.368
And we need you,

21:22.411 --> 21:24.326
and everyone who died,

21:24.370 --> 21:26.502
to come back and help us fight.

21:26.546 --> 21:29.157
But Ronnie, we fought that war
and we won.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.941
Anyway, I'm done fighting.

21:30.985 --> 21:32.203
I can't go back.

21:32.247 --> 21:34.380
My place is here with Betty
and the kids.

21:34.423 --> 21:35.903
I hear all of that.

21:35.946 --> 21:39.515
But Betty, the real Betty,
needs you back home, Archie.

21:39.559 --> 21:41.735
The life
you're enjoying here,

21:41.778 --> 21:45.173
that's what we're all
fighting for, back in
the real Riverdale.

21:45.216 --> 21:47.871
This is the real Riverdale.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.743
Everything that
I've ever wanted

21:49.786 --> 21:51.179
is all right here.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.926
Veronica. Hey,
I didn't realize you'd be here.

21:58.969 --> 22:00.057
Do you want to stay for dinner?

22:00.580 --> 22:01.842
Betty. Hi.

22:01.885 --> 22:04.410
Uh... no, I should get going.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.934
I have a lot to do back home.

22:06.977 --> 22:09.545
- Okay. Nice to see you.
- Yeah. Good to see you.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.423
Archie, please...
just think about it, at least.

22:19.512 --> 22:20.600
I know you'll do
the right thing.

22:22.602 --> 22:25.431
Mom? Dad? I have to tell you
guys something.

22:25.474 --> 22:27.084
Yeah, Anthony, of course.

22:27.128 --> 22:28.434
You know
you can tell us anything.

22:28.477 --> 22:30.349
Okay. Well, Timmy Twyst
and I...

22:31.611 --> 22:32.438
we're in love.

22:33.482 --> 22:35.658
And we... we want
to get married.

22:38.618 --> 22:39.532
Unbelievable.

22:39.575 --> 22:42.056
- That's amazing.
- Really?

22:42.099 --> 22:43.579
I...

22:43.623 --> 22:45.581
I didn't know how you guys
were gonna take the news.

22:45.625 --> 22:47.278
That our son's getting married?

22:47.322 --> 22:48.758
Anthony, we're thrilled.

22:48.802 --> 22:52.109
Don't pop the champagne
quite yet.

22:52.153 --> 22:54.895
Sorry to interrupt,
but might the grownups
have a word?

22:56.244 --> 22:58.289
Okay, so let me get
this straight.

22:58.333 --> 23:01.075
You're saying that Percival
killed us at our wedding

23:01.118 --> 23:02.424
and that all of this
is just some sort of--

23:02.468 --> 23:05.122
Your version of Serpent Heaven.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.560
Alas, you must return
to the mortal coil.

23:07.603 --> 23:10.345
You were untimely ripped
from the bosom of life.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.391
Riverdale is on the precipice
of an apocalypse.

23:12.434 --> 23:16.482
And what's worse
is baby Anthony,
your actual living son

23:17.221 --> 23:18.962
is an orphan.

23:19.006 --> 23:21.008
Damn it, Cheryl,
you've always hated
the fact that Toni chose me.

23:23.097 --> 23:27.928
Now you come to us with
this crazy story about Anthony
still being a baby?

23:27.971 --> 23:30.757
Cheryl, we got married,
and then we went
on our honeymoon

23:30.800 --> 23:32.149
to the Poconos.

23:32.193 --> 23:33.455
Nobody died at our wedding.

23:33.499 --> 23:34.761
I promise you both,

23:34.804 --> 23:37.459
I am not here to create chaos,
for a change,

23:37.503 --> 23:40.636
but we have a rapidly
shrinking opportunity
to make things right.

23:42.464 --> 23:45.554
Toni, you are
an incredible mother.

23:45.598 --> 23:48.427
You would never leave
baby Anthony. Please?

23:49.906 --> 23:51.430
Do you really think I would
lie to you about this?

23:51.473 --> 23:53.954
You would, though.
When Polly and Jason
got married,

23:53.997 --> 23:55.564
you tried to
sabotage them, too.

23:58.088 --> 24:00.482
Polly and Jason are married,
did you say?

24:00.526 --> 24:03.093
Yeah, despite
your best efforts.

24:04.312 --> 24:06.532
Consider what
I am saying, T.T.

24:06.575 --> 24:07.620
Listen to your mother's heart.

24:08.751 --> 24:09.665
You'll know it's real.

24:18.935 --> 24:19.893
Here you go, sir.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.547
Oh, my God.

24:21.590 --> 24:24.288
I'm so excited. I brought
my entire collection
for you to sign.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.290
- I hope that's okay?
- Yeah, of course.

24:26.334 --> 24:27.640
You're a big fan
of <i>Mad House Glads?</i>

24:27.683 --> 24:29.555
Oh, my God, I am obsessed.

24:29.598 --> 24:31.600
I mean, reading your comics
pretty much got me
through everything.

24:31.644 --> 24:32.949
You know, tough days at school,

24:32.993 --> 24:34.647
my parents splitting up,
getting dumped.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.866
You know, TBH, the Glads
are, like, my best friends.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.477
Yeah, me too.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.826
I'm so happy to hear that.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.305
Uh, who should
I make this out to?

24:41.349 --> 24:42.698
- Um, Fran.
- Fran.

24:51.141 --> 24:53.970
So you finally made it
to Heaven?

24:54.014 --> 24:57.670
I'm sorry, but--
I know you, don't I?

24:57.713 --> 24:59.541
My name is Raphael.

24:59.585 --> 25:02.588
Is your name... Raphael?

25:03.327 --> 25:04.285
Indeed it is.

25:05.895 --> 25:09.464
And are you my Guardian angel?

25:10.421 --> 25:11.553
I am.

25:12.598 --> 25:16.253
So, are you here
for the signing or--

25:16.297 --> 25:20.519
I'm here for Jughead,
but he's having such
a good time.

25:20.562 --> 25:23.478
I'm just going to give him
a minute

25:23.522 --> 25:25.741
to let him finish up.

25:25.785 --> 25:30.441
While we're waiting,
why don't I bring you up
to speed on a few things?

25:32.661 --> 25:36.665
<i>♪ Don't-a forbid me</i>

25:36.709 --> 25:39.799
<i>♪ To hold you tight</i>

25:40.843 --> 25:43.803
<i>♪ Darling, don't forbid me...</i>

25:43.846 --> 25:47.415
Cheryl. We weren't
expecting you.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.722
But come, sit. Have some tea.

25:50.897 --> 25:54.509
Polly. Jason.

25:56.729 --> 25:58.339
How are things?

25:58.382 --> 25:59.949
Never better.

25:59.993 --> 26:03.692
The maple business is booming,
trees are swollen with sap.

26:03.736 --> 26:07.566
Oh, but Cheryl, none of that
is even the best part.

26:07.609 --> 26:08.479
There's more?

26:09.437 --> 26:11.613
We're pregnant again.

26:12.745 --> 26:13.702
Triplets, this time.

26:15.661 --> 26:18.359
This is all so wonderful.

26:18.402 --> 26:20.361
It is. Isn't it?

26:24.017 --> 26:26.672
Cheryl, what's wrong?

26:27.716 --> 26:30.719
Oh. Why are you crying,
you silly goose?

26:30.763 --> 26:33.592
I'm just so relieved
to see you thriving.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.855
I miss you both so much.

26:35.898 --> 26:37.944
But there's no reason
to miss us.

26:37.987 --> 26:41.077
You can stay right here
in Thornhill with us
for as long as you want.

26:42.296 --> 26:43.689
If only that were true.

26:59.705 --> 27:01.663
So what's the plan, Spellman?

27:01.707 --> 27:02.925
Whatever do you mean?

27:02.969 --> 27:07.843
I mean, thanks to you,
I have a viable body

27:07.887 --> 27:10.890
that's not squid food
at the bottom of
the sea of sorrows,

27:10.933 --> 27:15.285
and that makes me think
that you are up to something.

27:15.329 --> 27:20.290
Well, this completely out
of the blue opportunity
fell into my lap,

27:20.334 --> 27:22.728
so, I took it,

27:22.771 --> 27:26.253
but now that you mention it,
what if we ran away?

27:26.296 --> 27:27.689
Hm?

27:27.733 --> 27:31.737
Left Greendale. Left everything
and everyone behind.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.608
The coven?

27:33.652 --> 27:35.349
Your responsibilities,
your family?

27:36.785 --> 27:38.482
We could get one
of those little cottages

27:38.526 --> 27:40.484
near the mountains of madness.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.922
'Brina, first of all,
you're aunties would kill me.

27:42.965 --> 27:46.403
Second of all,
death will come for us

27:46.447 --> 27:50.016
and find us, and we might both
get dragged away this time...

27:51.321 --> 27:52.322
for good.

27:53.802 --> 27:54.847
We're already on borrowed time.

27:57.545 --> 27:59.416
You know,
I still haven't forgiven you

27:59.460 --> 28:03.899
or my aunties
for tricking me into this.

28:03.943 --> 28:06.685
This... this horrible,
this completely...

28:07.816 --> 28:09.688
- untenable situation.
- Hey, hey.

28:10.863 --> 28:14.562
Hey... the realms needed you.

28:15.258 --> 28:17.652
The coven needed you.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.742
I made my decision,
and I would do it again
in a heartbeat.

28:20.786 --> 28:21.830
Don't cry.

28:22.570 --> 28:24.224
Not for me.

28:24.267 --> 28:26.879
Hey, babe, what was that thing
that you're Aunt C used to say?

28:26.922 --> 28:30.491
Witches... don't... cry.

28:38.107 --> 28:40.022
Your favorite, Dad.
Surf and turf.

28:40.066 --> 28:40.849
You did it, Reg.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.503
You made it.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.291
This is how it's going
to be from now on, Dad.

28:48.335 --> 28:50.250
You're going to get everything
you've ever wanted.

28:50.293 --> 28:54.080
- And then some.
- Let's not talk that way, Reg. We both know the truth.

28:54.123 --> 28:55.124
I'm sick.

28:55.168 --> 28:56.909
I don't have
that much time left.

28:56.952 --> 29:00.260
No, Dad, I've got something
in the works.

29:00.303 --> 29:02.262
A way for you to jump
the line and get a new heart.

29:03.002 --> 29:04.743
Hm.

29:04.786 --> 29:06.570
Okay, Reggie, first of all,

29:06.614 --> 29:10.357
I would love nothing more
than to spend
more time with you.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.837
But I've been facing down
the grim reaper

29:11.880 --> 29:14.796
for a while now,
and it's made me
examine my life.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.363
I wasn't a good father to you,

29:16.406 --> 29:17.799
or husband to your mother.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.192
And now that
I'm at the end of the line,

29:19.235 --> 29:22.891
I want to make sure
that I go out with dignity.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.024
If I can.

29:25.067 --> 29:26.895
Dad, you don't know
what you're saying.

29:26.939 --> 29:29.245
I do. I know what's coming,
and I'm ready to die...

29:30.507 --> 29:31.291
with honor.

29:35.382 --> 29:36.775
Are you sure
you want to do this?

29:37.688 --> 29:40.387
No, but it's time.

29:41.518 --> 29:43.129
Psychopomps are gathering.

29:46.741 --> 29:47.698
Them again.

29:52.007 --> 29:54.009
I love you, Sabrina Spellman.

29:54.053 --> 29:55.576
In death and beyond.

29:55.619 --> 29:56.707
I love you, Nick Scratch.

29:58.884 --> 30:00.059
Forever and always.

30:37.270 --> 30:38.924
What the hell am
I supposed to do?

30:41.143 --> 30:42.275
<i>Pull it together, Mantle.</i>

30:44.364 --> 30:46.061
Who's there?

30:46.105 --> 30:48.324
- Who's there? <i>
- Don't you recognize</i> <i>your own voice?</i>

30:52.720 --> 30:54.461
Oh please, God. No.

30:56.071 --> 30:57.072
Are you a ghost?

30:57.116 --> 30:59.074
<i>No. Your conscience.</i>

30:59.118 --> 31:00.902
<i>You can't kill Keller.</i>

31:00.946 --> 31:02.599
<i>But you already know that,</i> <i>
don't you?</i>

31:04.601 --> 31:06.603
You don't understand, bro.

31:07.343 --> 31:09.128
Percival's testing me.

31:09.171 --> 31:10.869
It's either Keller or my dad.

31:10.912 --> 31:13.132
<i>Oh my God, get your head</i> <i>
out of your ass and use it.</i>

31:13.175 --> 31:14.829
<i>What did you do in high school</i>

31:14.873 --> 31:16.875
<i>when you didn't know the answer</i> <i>
on a multiple-choice test?</i>

31:16.918 --> 31:19.660
- What do you mean? <i>
- Don't take the test.</i>

31:19.703 --> 31:23.142
<i>Get your dad, get your pal,</i> <i>
and blow out of town.</i>

31:23.185 --> 31:25.448
<i>Percival thinks</i> <i>
he knows what you want.</i>

31:25.492 --> 31:27.929
<i>Money, power, respect.</i>

31:27.973 --> 31:32.325
<i>But what you really want</i> <i>
is to be the hero and alive.</i>

31:32.368 --> 31:33.630
<i>But you've got to move fast.</i>

31:36.068 --> 31:37.330
What's up, witches?

31:37.373 --> 31:38.897
How'd it go
in the "Sweet hereafter?"

31:38.940 --> 31:39.985
Not well.

31:41.203 --> 31:43.249
The dead don't want
to come back.

31:43.292 --> 31:46.165
Some of them
were downright hostile,
in fact.

31:47.035 --> 31:49.342
How'd it go with Jughead,
Tabitha?

31:49.385 --> 31:51.257
Did you pull
at his heartstrings?

31:51.300 --> 31:53.041
I couldn't bring myself
to do it.

31:53.085 --> 31:56.088
We need them back here
with us where they belong.

31:56.131 --> 31:57.176
Clearly they're not in their...

31:57.219 --> 31:58.786
right minds.

31:58.829 --> 32:01.484
Yeah, she's right.
The time for gentle coaxing
is over.

32:01.528 --> 32:04.096
You need to pull them back ASAP
before it's too late.

32:04.139 --> 32:07.055
I hear you. And don't worry,
I have a Plan B,

32:07.099 --> 32:10.537
or would this...
will this be Plan C?

32:10.580 --> 32:14.671
But this time it won't be me
bringing your loved ones back.

32:14.715 --> 32:16.064
- It'll be Cheryl.
- Me?

32:17.587 --> 32:19.459
Why for?

32:19.502 --> 32:21.896
Because, Cheryl, the same way
I sensed something special
about Betty,

32:21.940 --> 32:23.724
I sense something special
in you.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.900
An extraordinary ability.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.250
- Yeah, my pyrokinesis.
- No, no, no, no.

32:28.294 --> 32:33.038
Pyrokinesis is only
the first manifestation
of a much more potent gift.

32:33.081 --> 32:36.780
You, Cheryl Blossom,
possess the power
of the Phoenix.

32:41.872 --> 32:44.136
What... what the hell
is the power of the Phoenix?

32:44.179 --> 32:46.529
The Phoenix is a bird
from various mythologies.

32:46.573 --> 32:50.011
The Phoenix dies in flames
but it's also reborn in them.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.970
The Phoenix rises
from the ashes.

32:52.013 --> 32:55.190
Individuals with
the Phoenix power are rare,

32:55.234 --> 32:56.539
but they have
the gift of resurrection.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.020
Bringing the dead back to life.

32:59.064 --> 33:02.241
This is
cuckoo bananas,

33:02.284 --> 33:04.069
but I'm also
kind of feeling it.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.288
So what do I do?

33:06.332 --> 33:07.898
It should be clear,

33:07.942 --> 33:10.466
you'd be ripping your friends
from the "Sweet hereafter."

33:10.510 --> 33:12.468
You all have
to be okay with that.

33:12.512 --> 33:14.601
- Are you?
- What are the risks again?

33:14.644 --> 33:18.822
Souls might return incomplete
or infected with some kind
of malignancy.

33:18.866 --> 33:22.261
Those returned might
resent you for the rest
of their natural lives.

33:22.304 --> 33:24.480
We're still at war.
The worst is yet to come.

33:24.524 --> 33:25.873
What choice do we really have?

33:25.916 --> 33:28.136
I'll give Cheryl
the necromantic incantation

33:28.180 --> 33:30.051
to tap into
her Phoenix ability,

33:30.095 --> 33:32.488
and the rest of you
will have to gather
all the bodies in one place.

33:32.532 --> 33:34.403
Where then Cheryl
and Cheryl alone

33:34.447 --> 33:37.058
will make things hot enough
for them to combust.

33:37.102 --> 33:40.670
Wait, Cheryl is going
to burn the bodies?

33:40.714 --> 33:44.109
Yes, and then hopefully
your friends
rise from the ashes.

33:45.153 --> 33:46.111
Reborn.

33:47.938 --> 33:54.249
Okay, well...
I'll do it in the mines then.

33:54.293 --> 33:56.208
Stay close
and be quiet.

34:01.169 --> 34:01.996
Whoa!

34:05.565 --> 34:06.696
You're trespassing, fellas.

34:06.740 --> 34:08.481
Oh. Reggie.
Reggie, Reggie.

34:10.135 --> 34:13.007
Now, I can't say
that I am surprised,
but I am disappointed.

34:29.154 --> 34:33.332
All right,
Cheryl Marjorie Blossom,
it's all up to you now.

34:41.688 --> 34:43.342
Power of fire from within,

34:43.385 --> 34:46.214
put blaze upon their cold,
damp skin.

34:46.258 --> 34:48.042
Cleanse each body,
renew each soul,

34:48.086 --> 34:50.262
until nothing's
left but ash and coal.

34:50.305 --> 34:53.613
I call upon the Phoenix power
to help us at this mortal hour.

34:53.656 --> 34:57.138
Accept the vessel
upon this hearth,
complete the cycle of rebirth.

34:57.182 --> 34:58.618
<i>Does this mean you're leaving,</i>

35:00.402 --> 35:02.361
because of what Veronica said?

35:02.404 --> 35:06.104
If there's even a chance
of what Ronnie said is true,
I can't sit out a war.

35:06.147 --> 35:09.281
I know... I know, Arch.

35:09.324 --> 35:10.325
Just come home to me.

35:11.848 --> 35:12.762
I will.

35:16.201 --> 35:16.984
Is it getting hot in here?

35:19.334 --> 35:20.770
My God, Archie, you're burning.

35:21.641 --> 35:22.642
What's happening to you?

35:25.340 --> 35:27.516
What's going on with the heat?

35:27.560 --> 35:29.649
Did you just turn it up?
I'm frying.

35:30.824 --> 35:33.218
Babe. What's wrong?

35:34.436 --> 35:36.786
There are no photos
after our wedding, Fangs.

35:37.613 --> 35:38.962
Just blank pages.

35:41.661 --> 35:43.228
I think Cheryl was right.

35:43.271 --> 35:44.968
I don't think we're meant
to be here.

35:52.454 --> 35:53.847
Hey, Pop,
could you crank the AC,

35:53.890 --> 35:55.675
I'm melting in here.

35:55.718 --> 35:58.721
Power of fire from within,
put a blaze upon their cold,
damp skin.

35:58.765 --> 36:00.332
Cleanse each body,
renew each soul,

36:00.375 --> 36:02.421
until nothing's left
but ash and coal.

36:02.464 --> 36:04.118
I call upon the Phoenix power,

36:04.162 --> 36:05.902
to help us
at this mortal hour.

36:05.946 --> 36:09.341
Accept the vessel
upon this hearth,
complete the cycle of rebirth.

36:30.666 --> 36:32.538
Well, I'm so happy
everything worked out.

36:32.581 --> 36:34.061
At least for the moment.

36:34.104 --> 36:36.368
I just wish I could have
seen you in action.

36:36.411 --> 36:38.239
Well, I was quite amazing.

36:38.283 --> 36:40.720
I just hope
you don't get in trouble
for what you did.

36:40.763 --> 36:42.678
I... I don't know
what you mean.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.682
Just... be careful.

36:48.293 --> 36:49.337
Death doesn't like
to be cheated.

36:57.345 --> 37:03.090
I'm so sorry, Jughead...
but we needed
to bring you back.

37:06.311 --> 37:08.878
And I... I wanted you back.

37:09.662 --> 37:11.011
Wait, say that again.

37:12.317 --> 37:15.450
If we have any hope
of stopping Percival,

37:15.494 --> 37:17.278
we needed
to bring everyone back.

37:17.322 --> 37:18.192
You included.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.541
I can hear you.

37:19.585 --> 37:21.369
- What?
- I can hear your voice.

37:21.413 --> 37:23.502
What do you mean?
You're not deaf anymore?

37:23.545 --> 37:24.329
Apparently not.

37:25.417 --> 37:26.940
<i>What about reading--</i>

37:26.983 --> 37:29.769
Yes, I can still hear
your thoughts,
loud and clear.

37:32.337 --> 37:34.382
Well, that cushions the blow.

37:34.426 --> 37:40.040
Maybe Cheryl's Phoenix
Power rebooted you,
reset your systems, somehow.

37:40.083 --> 37:41.259
Gave you the ability
to hear again.

37:46.612 --> 37:48.570
- Oh, my God.
- What?

37:48.614 --> 37:49.484
I just remembered it.

37:50.833 --> 37:52.618
In the bunker,
right before I died...

37:54.750 --> 37:55.882
there was another Jughead.

37:59.407 --> 38:03.498
Now that it's just us,
how was the "Sweet Hereafter,"
Cheryl?

38:05.065 --> 38:09.939
It was... painful at first...

38:09.983 --> 38:13.813
seeing my own family
happy without me.

38:15.989 --> 38:17.382
And I couldn't help but think,

38:18.600 --> 38:20.385
"What if they were given
a second chance, too?"

38:22.430 --> 38:23.518
But they've been gone so long.

38:25.564 --> 38:29.350
I know,
I still needed to try, though.

38:30.569 --> 38:32.484
What do you mean, try?

38:32.527 --> 38:34.573
Sorry we're late, Cheryl.

38:34.616 --> 38:38.794
Oh, on the contrary,
dearest sister,
you are right on time.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.362
Welcome home, Blossoms.

38:48.543 --> 38:49.979
Veronica said,

38:50.023 --> 38:52.591
"You and I were happily
together in the afterlife."

38:54.201 --> 38:57.335
We were. We had two kids.

38:58.901 --> 39:01.121
- Little Fred and little Polly.
- Aw.

39:01.164 --> 39:02.688
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

39:02.731 --> 39:04.864
We couldn't come up
with more creative names
than that?

39:06.300 --> 39:07.170
I guess not.

39:08.563 --> 39:11.436
But being married to you,
having a family with you,

39:11.479 --> 39:13.612
it was literally like
my Heaven.

39:13.655 --> 39:15.918
<i>♪ Tippy-toes Tippy-toes</i>

39:15.962 --> 39:19.400
<i>♪ I'm on my Tippy-toes</i> <i>
Tippy-toes ♪</i>

39:20.445 --> 39:22.534
<i>♪ I'm walking on egg shells</i>

39:22.577 --> 39:24.362
<i>♪ I'm careful with myself</i>

39:24.405 --> 39:26.538
<i>♪ Trying not to break</i> <i>
The danger ♪</i>

39:26.581 --> 39:29.323
I just thought
I would check in on you.

39:29.367 --> 39:32.065
Ah, you mean
because everyone else

39:32.108 --> 39:36.199
is happily reunited
and I'm alone dealing
with the fact

39:36.243 --> 39:37.940
that Betty and Archie
are endgame?

39:37.984 --> 39:39.594
About that...

39:39.638 --> 39:42.467
Yes, in a lot of
the future scenarios
I saw Betty and Archie

39:42.510 --> 39:44.947
are endgame.

39:44.991 --> 39:47.515
Right. I'm sure I'll be
planning their wedding--

39:47.559 --> 39:48.690
But--

39:48.734 --> 39:50.953
And I really shouldn't
be saying this,

39:50.997 --> 39:53.695
in an almost equal number
of scenarios...

39:53.739 --> 39:56.524
you and Archie are endgame.

39:58.961 --> 40:03.401
- Meaning?
- Your romantic future is up for grabs.

40:08.580 --> 40:10.364
Congratulations, gentlemen.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.366
Now, instead of having
a single execution,

40:12.410 --> 40:15.064
we'll have three,
and I'll do the honors myself.

40:16.457 --> 40:17.371
Night, night.

40:28.643 --> 40:29.731
We're so screwed.

40:31.080 --> 40:31.994
Maybe not.

40:33.169 --> 40:34.997
Before coming to bust you out,

40:35.041 --> 40:37.478
I grabbed
a little insurance policy
from the shop.

40:42.614 --> 40:47.662
This is one
of Percival's magic weapons.

40:47.706 --> 40:49.142
I mean, it won't break us
out of here,

40:49.185 --> 40:52.101
but it'll be perfect
for sticking in someone's neck.

40:52.972 --> 40:54.626
Hopefully, Percival's.

40:59.065 --> 41:00.414
I'm glad you both made it back.

41:01.937 --> 41:03.722
And I hope you are, too.

41:03.765 --> 41:05.158
We are, Tabitha.

41:06.333 --> 41:07.943
Definitely.

41:07.987 --> 41:10.946
But we still don't know
how or why

41:10.990 --> 41:14.341
baby Anthony survived
the plague of the firstborn?

41:14.384 --> 41:18.388
Oh, well,
I learned a few things

41:18.432 --> 41:22.044
during my visit
to the "Sweet Hereafter".

41:22.088 --> 41:27.180
The first is...
baby Anthony can't die...

41:28.573 --> 41:32.446
because he's immortal.

41:34.013 --> 41:36.929
What? How do you know that?

41:36.972 --> 41:41.194
Because an angel... told me.

41:41.237 --> 41:47.766
He also said that
I'm Riverdale's...
guardian angel.
