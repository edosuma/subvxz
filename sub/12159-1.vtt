AT SOCCER.

17:15.667 --> 17:18.636
OH, MY GOD! WHAT IF THIS MEANS
EVE HAS TO QUIT SOCCER?

17:18.638 --> 17:20.705
WHAT IF SHE
NEVER COMES BACK TO ME?

17:20.707 --> 17:22.540
TO US. THE TEAM.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.543
EVE PLAYS SOCCER, TOO?

17:25.545 --> 17:28.012
YES, AND SHE'S AMAZING.

17:28.014 --> 17:31.315
SHE'S LIKE A YOUNG LEOPARD,
BUT ALSO A WARM SPRING BREEZE.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.051
AND A DAISY.

17:34.186 --> 17:38.189
I'M OLD, LITTLE GIRL.
YOU HAVE TO TRY TO MAKE SENSE.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.490
CAMMY,
EVE'S GONNA BE FINE.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.559
LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE THIS UPSTAIRS FOR HER KNEE

17:41.561 --> 17:42.660
IF YOU WANT TO BE HELPFUL.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.796
THANK YOU,
EVE'S MOM!

17:45.898 --> 17:48.166
THAT IS
A STRANGE CHILD.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.166
LISTEN, HONEY...

17:49.168 --> 17:53.171
I THINK THE GAME OF FOOTBALL
IS DUE A LITTLE APOLOGY.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.106
I DON'T CARE, MIKE.
I DON'T CARE.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.908
SHE'S QUITTING.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.342
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THIS HAPPENED AT SOCCER.

17:58.344 --> 17:59.911
SHE'S BEEN PLAYING SOCCER
FOR NINE YEARS,

17:59.913 --> 18:00.911
NOTHING'S EVER HAPPENED.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.047
I MEAN NOTHING -- NO SCORING,
NO ACTION, NOTHING.

18:03.049 --> 18:06.117
NINE YEARS OF ME IN THE STANDS
WITH YOU NEXT TO ME...

18:06.119 --> 18:08.086
"WAKE UP, GET UP,
IT'S OVER, WAKE UP!"

18:08.088 --> 18:09.520
IT'S ALL TOO MUCH, MIKE.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.090
T-THE FOOTBALL, THE SOCCER,
THE JUNIOR ROTC.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.759
COME ON. WE CAN'T STOP HER
FROM DOING FUN, CRAZY STUFF.

18:14.761 --> 18:15.760
THAT'S WHO SHE IS.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.395
YEAH, BECAUSE
YOU MADE HER THAT WAY.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.896
YOU'RE BLAMING ME...
YES.

18:18.898 --> 18:21.099
...FOR OUR OVER-ACHIEVING,
ATHLETIC, BRILLIANT DAUGHTER,

18:21.101 --> 18:22.066
THEN I'LL TAKE THAT.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.534
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M BLAMING YOU FOR?

18:23.536 --> 18:24.902
THIS. THIS.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.071
IT'S A NOMINATION LETTER
FOR WEST POINT.
YEAH.

18:27.073 --> 18:28.039
CAME THREE DAYS AGO.

18:28.041 --> 18:30.108
IT'S FROM
CONGRESSWOMAN DeWITT.
GREAT.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.375
I ASKED ED
TO HELP US OUT.

18:31.377 --> 18:32.577
THIS IS GREAT NEWS.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.412
HE THINKS HE CAN GET
JOE BIDEN TO DO THIS.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.380
HE KNOWS THE GUY
THAT WHITENS HIS TEETH.

18:37.816 --> 18:39.917
I DON'T WANT
EVE GOING TO WEST POINT.

18:39.919 --> 18:40.917
I DON'T.

18:40.919 --> 18:43.454
IT WAS ONE THING WHEN SHE
WAS LITTLE, BUT NOW IT'S JUST...

18:43.456 --> 18:45.089
IT'S -- IT'S STARTING
TO BE TOO REAL, MIKE.

18:45.091 --> 18:47.058
IF EVE BECOMES
A SOLDIER,

18:47.060 --> 18:51.095
JUST THINK -- SOMEDAY,
THE NEWS AT OUR FRONT DOOR...

18:51.097 --> 18:53.331
IT -- IT MIGHT BE WORSE
THAN A HURT KNEE.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.000
I'M SCARED OF THIS, TOO.
OKAY?

18:56.002 --> 18:59.170
IT'S THE MOST TERRIFYING THING
I EVER WENT THROUGH.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.104
BEING A SOLDIER.

19:00.106 --> 19:03.074
NAH.
BEING A PARENT.

19:03.076 --> 19:05.009
CAN'T PROTECT YOUR KIDS FROM
THE CHOICES THEY WANNA MAKE,

19:05.011 --> 19:07.111
EVEN WHEN THEY'RE
SCARING THE HELL OUTTA YOU.

19:07.113 --> 19:10.014
OKAY, SO, UH...
SO, WHAT DID<i> YOU</i> DO?

19:10.016 --> 19:13.050
I TRY TO SHUT DOWN
MY EMOTIONS.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.319
I'M PRETTY GOOD AT IT.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.255
THIS HELPS.

19:17.257 --> 19:21.159
SO OUTSIDE OF USING ALCOHOL
TO PUSH DOWN YOUR EMOTIONS,

19:21.161 --> 19:22.326
WE CAN TRY
TO KEEP THE KID SAFE

19:22.328 --> 19:23.928
WHILE SHE'S
LIVING UNDER OUR ROOF.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.263
THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO.

19:25.265 --> 19:28.332
I WANT TO SUPPORT EVE IN
EVERYTHING THAT SHE DOES, BUT...

19:28.334 --> 19:29.534
YOU CAN'T HOLD HER BACK

19:29.536 --> 19:31.369
FROM BEING THE WOMAN
THAT SHE WANTS TO BE.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.104
THE WORLD'S
GONNA DO ENOUGH OF THAT.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.041
I'M WITH MY SON, THE FEMINIST,
ON THIS.

19:39.645 --> 19:41.345
IT'S NEVER GONNA GET EASY,
IS IT?

19:41.347 --> 19:44.916
I TOLD YOU
KIDS WERE A BAD IDEA.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.052
[ SIGHS ]

19:48.054 --> 19:49.954
AH, HERE. MIGHT AS WELL
GIVE THIS TO EVE.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.455
SHE'LL BE REALLY HAPPY
TO SEE IT.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.891
UH, YOU SHOULD
GIVE IT TO HER.

19:53.893 --> 19:57.395
WHY ME?
WELL, I DON'T WANT HER
TO THINK I OPENED HER MAIL.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.130
THAT IS,
IN FACT, A FELONY.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.306
GOOD JOB, MIKE.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.241
THANKS, DAD.

20:10.243 --> 20:13.010
UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT
FOR YOUR KIDS...

20:13.012 --> 20:14.045
MM-HMM.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.547
...AND NEVER, EVER
SHOW FAVORITES.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.283
I GOT THAT FROM JIMMY.

20:27.326 --> 20:30.995
WELL, THAT'S -- THAT'S
ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.264
EVE'S A GREAT KID.
EVE'S A GREAT KID.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.833
AND WEST POINT HAS ALWAYS
BEEN A DREAM OF HERS, SIR.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.269
YEAH, SO THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

20:38.271 --> 20:41.005
IT'S BEEN AN HONOR SPEAKING
WITH YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT,

20:41.007 --> 20:43.441
AND I'M SURE YOU HAVE -- SURE
YOU HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO

20:43.443 --> 20:46.244
WITH YOUR TIME RIGHT NOW, SIR,
YOUR VALUABLE TIME.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.412
NO, I-I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING PRESSING

20:48.414 --> 20:50.181
I HAVE TO DO RIGHT NOW.

20:51.283 --> 20:52.850
DO I LIKE JOKES?

20:52.852 --> 20:55.353
SURE, SURE.
GO AHEAD.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.687
ALL RIGHT.
[ CHUCKLES ] YEAH.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.623
OKAY, UH...

21:00.559 --> 21:03.494
HOW MANY<i> DOES</i> IT TAKE
TO SCREW IN A LIGHT BULB, SIR?

21:05.797 --> 21:07.932
REALLY? WELL,
THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE

21:07.934 --> 21:12.470
TO DO WHAT SEEMS TO BE
LIKE A RELATIVELY SIMPLE TASK.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.038
UM...

21:14.040 --> 21:15.973
WHA-- SIR?

21:15.975 --> 21:18.609
DID I HEAR A TOILET FLUSH?
