00:01.919 --> 00:03.503
Previously on Homeland‒

00:03.629 --> 00:07.590
Sandy had a dark asset providing
targeting information on
terrorists in the border region.

00:07.716 --> 00:10.760
So?
He was out there trading
top secret information‒

00:10.886 --> 00:12.845
Oh, please.
to God knows who,

00:12.930 --> 00:15.807
in exchange for a few
successful drone strikes.

00:15.891 --> 00:17.642
So, what was that about
with Lockhart?

00:17.726 --> 00:21.729
I'm going back to Islamabad
as station chief.

00:22.648 --> 00:25.233
- Ah, good morning.
- Ambassador.

00:25.317 --> 00:28.903
Aayan, those were your relatives
that were killed in the wedding
party the Americans bombed?

00:28.987 --> 00:30.488
Look, the Americans,
they're murderers, okay?

00:30.572 --> 00:32.615
But what we did to that man,
how is that any different?

00:32.700 --> 00:34.575
Kid who shot the wedding video...

00:34.660 --> 00:37.245
turns out he's a nephew
of Haissam Haqqani.

00:37.329 --> 00:40.248
- I need a favor. Put this
someplace safe for a while.
- Yeah. What is it?

00:40.332 --> 00:43.042
Just, um, personal things
that I don't want taken.

00:49.425 --> 00:52.260
- I'm quitting my job.
- Something happen?

00:52.344 --> 00:54.095
A lot of things happened.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.639
Fuck me.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.933
It was premeditated—
the whole thing
from start to finish.

00:59.017 --> 01:02.437
There was a guy in the crowd
with an earpiece
coordinating the whole thing.

01:03.522 --> 01:04.939
Jesus, Quinn.

01:05.023 --> 01:08.651
This changes everything.
It means I really need you now.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.779
You don't know
who you can trust yet,

01:11.864 --> 01:14.365
so you need to set up
a second station somewhere,

01:14.450 --> 01:17.034
with your own people,
independent of the embassy.

01:17.161 --> 01:20.329
Are we up on the kid yet?
Yeah.
He's back at school.

01:20.456 --> 01:22.206
You're in trouble, Aayan.
Who are you?

01:22.291 --> 01:24.751
My name is Carrie Macpherson.
Fara Sassani works for me.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.586
I'm her London bureau chief.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.379
You don't understand.
I cannot talk to you.

01:28.464 --> 01:31.966
What are you scared of?
Who's threatening you?

01:32.050 --> 01:34.177
Because I can protect you,
Aayan.

01:34.261 --> 01:37.013
I can even get you out of Pakistan
if that's what you want.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.098
How?

01:46.732 --> 01:48.357
Maneuvering
on your position.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.860
We'll be setting up
for an engagement.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.366
It's Alice
in fucking Wonderland.

01:58.827 --> 02:02.121
PID confirmed. Engage. Engage.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.128
- Where are you?
- I'm at a safe distance.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.256
Clipped an artery.

02:13.675 --> 02:16.427
I know a way.

02:20.516 --> 02:23.684
First, the US found and killed
Osama bin Laden‒

02:26.438 --> 02:29.232
You will die over there!

02:30.859 --> 02:33.194
Well, you can't keep snakes
in your backyard...

02:33.278 --> 02:35.988
and expect them
only to bite your neighbors.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.117
You know, there are things
that the Pakistanis have done,

02:40.202 --> 02:43.037
as complicated
as the relationship has been‒

02:45.624 --> 02:47.792
Roger. I'll try and get eyes on.

02:47.876 --> 02:51.587
- Oh, God.
- I'm so sorry.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.967
I have to say good-bye now.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.427
Just for a few more seconds.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.584
Vampire hours.
Jesus Christ.

03:29.668 --> 03:30.960
You scared me.

03:31.086 --> 03:32.837
You ever sleep?

03:32.921 --> 03:35.089
You ever knock?

03:35.841 --> 03:37.842
What are you looking at?

03:37.926 --> 03:41.178
Just trying to familiarize myself
with the local ISI agents.

03:41.263 --> 03:42.263
Mmm.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.144
Well, you won't find him
in that database.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.607
- Who?
- Farhad Ghazi.

03:53.942 --> 03:57.194
- Why not?
- He's not proper
Pakistani intelligence.

03:57.279 --> 04:01.824
He's a local hood
that they outsource
the strong-arm stuff to.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.747
Farhad Ghazi, huh?

04:07.831 --> 04:09.999
I never forget a pretty face.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.756
Don't say I never did
anything for you.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.357
Aayan.
Is your father here?

05:18.110 --> 05:19.610
No, it's okay.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.449
Do you have
the bag I gave you?

05:27.035 --> 05:28.786
Kiran?

05:29.913 --> 05:31.706
Kiran,
do you have the bag?

05:33.375 --> 05:34.875
Baba found it.

05:36.128 --> 05:39.046
Kiran, can I‒
I need the bag, please.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.673
Where is it?

05:40.799 --> 05:43.259
Kiran, tell me.
He destroyed it.

05:43.385 --> 05:46.887
He smashed everything.
How could you
let him do that?

05:46.972 --> 05:51.100
I tried to stop him.
I begged him to stop.
I'm sorry.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.354
Kiran, you have no idea
what you just did.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.232
Who are the medicines
for, Aayan?

07:04.800 --> 07:07.093
Saul.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.595
- Carrie.
- Is there somewhere
we can talk?

07:11.723 --> 07:15.434
Put the bags in the car.
I'll be a couple of minutes.
This way. So?

07:15.519 --> 07:17.895
You still have contacts here
in the intelligence community,
right?

07:17.979 --> 07:19.271
Sure.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.982
Have you been in touch with
any of them on this trip?
No.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.735
- But I can always
pick up the phone.
- It's more than a call.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.403
I need you sitting
across from someone.

07:26.530 --> 07:29.115
Carrie, my plane leaves
in less than‒
Saul.

07:29.199 --> 07:32.076
Sandy's death was
no act of mob violence.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.869
It was premeditated.

07:35.413 --> 07:39.375
What?
The ISI killed him,
straight out.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.919
Look.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.004
This was taken that day
at the scene.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.884
Name's Farhad Ghazi.
He's a real creep with
a long history of wet work...

07:48.969 --> 07:52.221
for their counterterrorism unit.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.600
Who else knows about this?
Just you, me and Quinn.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.145
Well, you can't keep this to yourself.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.356
Langley needs to know.
White House needs to know.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.734
So, what, we lodge
a formal protest?
Yes.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.988
So, Pakistan issues
a formal denial, we expel
a bunch of their diplomats,

08:09.072 --> 08:11.866
they expel a bunch of ours,
and in the end,
nobody's held accountable.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.618
Accountability isn't in
the job description, Carrie.

08:14.703 --> 08:17.997
Sandy was one of ours,
murdered by one of theirs.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.749
That's a huge fucking deal.
Something's going on.

08:20.834 --> 08:24.336
- Something's always going on.
- No, not like this.

08:29.217 --> 08:32.428
Quinn called me last week,
concerned.

08:34.055 --> 08:36.265
About what?
You.

08:37.434 --> 08:40.561
Me? He's the one
who wigged out.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.230
Well, maybe that was
the more appropriate response.

08:44.566 --> 08:47.776
Well, maybe he should keep
his opinions to himself.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.408
So, you gonna help me or not?

08:58.121 --> 08:59.872
Hey, Quinn.
Hey, Fara.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.792
You're early.
Tailwinds.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.630
Carrie's not here yet.
Okay.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.716
I just put on some coffee.
Want some?
Sure.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.932
This free?
Yeah.

09:20.936 --> 09:24.355
So, catch me up.
Did Carrie identify the guy
with the earpiece?

09:24.439 --> 09:28.275
She did.
She's with Saul now,
laying out the operation.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.361
So Saul rattles
a general's cage or two...

09:30.445 --> 09:32.696
and we wait to see
who delivers the message
to our foot soldier.

09:32.781 --> 09:35.115
Yeah.
His name's Farhad Ghazi.

09:37.702 --> 09:40.204
How is she?
Carrie?

09:40.288 --> 09:43.415
Good.
Amazing, actually.

09:43.541 --> 09:47.711
Well, you got this place
up and running in record time.
All her.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.506
Honestly, I don't know
when she finds
the time to sleep.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.926
He's here.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.262
- Who?
- The medical student.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.482
Aayan.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.194
I will only speak to
Carrie Macpherson.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.904
She gave me her card.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.864
Carrie's not here
right now.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.575
But she's on her way.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.662
- How long?
- Ten minutes at the most.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.544
Please.
She'll want to see you.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.421
Come on, Aayan.
You can wait
in my office.

10:30.505 --> 10:33.173
You don't have to
talk to anyone else
if you don't want to.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.679
Okay. Okay.
This way.

10:42.350 --> 10:45.352
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll get you a glass of water.

10:54.529 --> 10:58.449
She left the embassy immediately
and went straight to the hotel
where Saul Berenson was staying.

10:58.533 --> 11:03.620
Spent 20 minutes there. Then
she had her security detail drop
her off at Faisal Avenue in G-8.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.206
I, uh, lost her
shortly afterwards.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.084
- Shortly?
- She's good.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.878
Gave no sign
she'd even made me.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.504
Hmm.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.299
You think anybody in her detail
will play ball with us?

11:15.425 --> 11:18.385
Well, they just got here.
Find out.

11:18.511 --> 11:23.098
Yeah.
And that photo of Farhad Ghazi‒
I'd never seen it before.

11:23.183 --> 11:27.269
Looked like a frame grab of
some kind. See if you can track
down where she got it from.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.438
Yeah.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.529
Where is he?
In my office.

11:44.996 --> 11:48.082
Did you really mean it
when you said you could
get me out of Pakistan?

11:48.166 --> 11:51.794
You let me tell your story,
I'll get you to London.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.379
But you can do that though?

11:54.255 --> 11:55.631
You can?
My paper can.

11:55.757 --> 11:59.301
We get sources out of
tricky situations all the time.
Okay.

11:59.427 --> 12:03.430
Good.
But, um, I need
80,000 rupees first.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.309
That's nearly £500.
What for?

12:07.435 --> 12:10.312
Can't tell you.
Then I can't
give it to you.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.193
I knew this wasn't for real.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.444
Aayan?

12:24.119 --> 12:26.161
Is this the man
that threatened you?

12:29.582 --> 12:33.085
Because if it is,
you're in a lot more trouble
than I thought.

12:34.629 --> 12:36.004
He works for state security.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.216
He's nobody you want
in your life under
any circumstances.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.142
Hey.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.810
Hey.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.953
What is going on, Aayan?

13:11.249 --> 13:13.792
You need to tell me.
Is he blackmailing you?

13:13.877 --> 13:16.753
No, it's not like that.
He's got nothing to do with
why I need the money.

13:16.880 --> 13:20.048
You have to tell me
why you need it then.
I can't.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.134
I can't.

13:23.344 --> 13:27.473
But 80,000 rupees will fix it,
whatever it is?

13:27.557 --> 13:29.725
It might.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.520
Okay.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.191
Come with me.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.987
Fara, I need 80,000 rupees
from petty cash.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.579
- Let me send somebody with you,
in case there's a problem.
- I have to do this alone.

14:02.425 --> 14:05.552
Thank you.
Be safe.

14:05.637 --> 14:09.681
And if you really want out
of Pakistan, you have to be
back here as soon as possible.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.266
Okay.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.769
Thank you.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.025
Go.
Max is already
in the van.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.576
Why are you looking
at me like that?

14:30.370 --> 14:32.287
Fara filled me in on the kid.

14:32.413 --> 14:35.958
And?
Getting anybody asylum
these days is no easy matter,

14:36.042 --> 14:38.835
much less a place
at medical college in London.

14:38.920 --> 14:42.256
- Yeah, I'm aware of that,
Quinn.
- So you have another play?

14:43.716 --> 14:46.093
He's an iron in the fire.
He knows something
he's not saying.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.929
Our man with the earpiece
paid him a visit last week.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.472
He did?

14:50.557 --> 14:53.934
- Anything else
you want to know?
- I'll get my things.

14:54.102 --> 14:58.272
Strategically,
United States' concerns about
the endgame in Afghanistan,

14:58.356 --> 15:01.900
Islamabad's persistent
attachment to violent
extremist groups,

15:01.985 --> 15:05.571
and the fact that Pakistan
may lurch into greater
internal instability...

15:05.655 --> 15:08.323
thus threatening the security
of its nuclear arsenal‒

15:08.408 --> 15:13.203
all means that an easy alliance
between our two countries is
not in the cards anytime soon.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.622
So, why bother?

15:15.707 --> 15:20.377
Why don't the US and Pakistan
stop driving each other mad
and break ties altogether?

15:20.461 --> 15:23.297
That's your topic.
No more than five pages.

15:23.381 --> 15:24.965
Thank you.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.974
Professor Boyd.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.976
I enjoyed your lecture.
Thank you.

15:36.102 --> 15:39.563
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?
No, but I knew your friend.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.190
- Who's that?
- Sandy Bachman.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.943
He was hardly a friend.

15:45.028 --> 15:47.863
Oh. That's not
what he told me.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.283
Who are you?

15:51.367 --> 15:55.370
I'm someone
who benefited greatly
from your friendship.

15:55.455 --> 16:00.751
And I am here to tell you
that's not about to end
now that he's dead.

16:00.877 --> 16:04.254
I have no idea what
you're talking about.
Oh, I think you do.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.340
I'm sorry.
You must have me confused
with somebody else.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.924
Do I?
Mm-hmm.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.593
Who else would be
providing Sandy...

16:09.677 --> 16:13.180
with classified documents
straight from
the ambassador's desk?

16:19.771 --> 16:21.521
I really have to go.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.750
Saul Berenson.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.251
General.

16:43.378 --> 16:46.213
No, no, no. I'm retired.
Please, call me Bunny.
Bunny.

16:46.297 --> 16:47.923
It's good to see you again.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.508
Yes, it is.

16:49.592 --> 16:53.095
Tongues are wagging
all over the club.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.305
Fraternizing with the enemy.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.182
You hate us so much?

16:57.266 --> 17:00.811
No American has set foot in here
since your raid on Abbottabad.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.729
We could go
someplace else.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.273
Nah. Fuck 'em all.

17:08.319 --> 17:11.488
- So, where are we?
-  We bugged his landline, his computer.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.699
Put in cameras.
He's on his cell phone.

17:13.783 --> 17:16.034
Why are we not hearing
the other side of the conversation?

17:16.119 --> 17:18.328
We couldn't get close enough.
He was on the move all morning.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.580
We need his cell phone.
That's where the call
will come in.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.582
And we have to be able
to trace the caller.

17:26.421 --> 17:29.756
Come on, guys. This is
the asshole who killed Sandy,
for Christ's sake.

17:29.841 --> 17:34.136
We're gonna have to get
within five feet of his phone
in order to clone it.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.971
Gotta do it while
he's asleep then.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.765
There must be another way.

17:38.850 --> 17:41.435
Not if he stays
in that apartment,
there isn't.

17:44.147 --> 17:46.356
It's not like
when we were fighting
the Cold War.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.233
No, the Russians
were tough, but...

17:48.317 --> 17:50.569
They didn't saw our heads off
on the Internet.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.362
Blow up innocent people.

17:52.447 --> 17:54.281
Fly airplanes into
the Twin Towers.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.993
Come on, Saul.
What?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.245
We both know
9/11 was a hoax.

18:01.873 --> 18:05.709
An Israeli-American excuse
to launch a crusade
against the Muslim world.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.502
Honestly, I don't know
what to say...

18:07.587 --> 18:11.339
when I hear men of your
deep knowledge and experience
talk like that.

18:11.466 --> 18:15.260
President Bush lied
about Iraq. Why not 9/11?
Because it's nonsense.

18:15.386 --> 18:17.929
Oh.
Like saying
bin Laden's not dead.

18:18.014 --> 18:21.141
Abbottabad was a CIA plot
meant to embarrass Pakistan.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.815
So, tell me, Saul.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.151
What do you want from me?
I want a favor.

18:31.235 --> 18:35.530
Somebody to talk to at the ISI,
somebody high up you trust.

18:36.407 --> 18:38.700
What's this about?
Can't say.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.453
My advice, then,
is to drop it.

18:41.537 --> 18:45.707
Now is not a time
to be trusting anyone inside
the Intelligence Directorate.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.168
Surely there must be somebody
I can reach out to there.

18:50.671 --> 18:54.925
Don't do it, Saul. It's not
even your business anymore.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.885
Go home.

18:57.011 --> 19:00.972
Spend time with
your wife. Garden.
I don't have a garden.

19:01.057 --> 19:05.352
But I seem to remember I do have
an outstanding credit with you.

19:07.563 --> 19:11.149
It's a little late in the game
to be calling in a chit.

19:11.275 --> 19:15.278
What do you mean?
It's over, Saul.
You have lost.

19:15.363 --> 19:20.492
The Americans are being
driven out of Afghanistan
just like the Russians were.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.537
The Taliban has won,
and they know it.

19:23.621 --> 19:26.039
And they will dictate
the terms of the settlement.

19:26.123 --> 19:30.836
Well, then, you can afford to be
a little gracious, can't you?

19:42.390 --> 19:45.892
Max, the taxi's stopping.
Pull over.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.281
This is Ommaya, the teaching hospital.
Yeah.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.743
What's he doing here?

20:12.712 --> 20:15.422
We gotta be hearing this.

20:15.506 --> 20:18.592
- Fara, he knows you.
- I'll keep out of sight.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.446
You there?

20:39.530 --> 20:42.991
I'm here, yeah.
I can't get any closer.

20:47.872 --> 20:50.457
He's giving her the money
he got from Carrie.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.918
What'd he tell her to do?
I don't know.
I can't hear.

20:56.005 --> 21:00.008
Looks like
she told him to wait.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.136
Then we wait too.

22:24.427 --> 22:25.927
Clone's accepted.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.723
Jesus.

22:29.807 --> 22:32.892
Get the fuck
out of there, Quinn.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.727
Go, Quinn.

23:19.315 --> 23:20.857
Call was local.

23:20.941 --> 23:23.610
Friend asking if Ghazi
wanted to go clubbing.

23:25.196 --> 23:27.030
At least we know it works.

23:28.449 --> 23:31.659
Come on, Bill.
There's got to be something.

23:31.744 --> 23:35.455
I'll do freshman composition,
adult night classes, anything.

23:36.332 --> 23:38.500
No, no, I understand.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.002
I thought that
might be the case.

23:41.087 --> 23:44.506
Look, can we compromise
with just an office?

23:44.590 --> 23:46.716
It doesn't even need
to be on campus‒

23:46.801 --> 23:49.052
just so I can sell it
to Martha.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.221
Come on, Bill, please.

23:51.305 --> 23:53.723
I'm going
out of my mind here.

23:53.808 --> 23:56.184
Sure.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.228
Sure, think about it.

23:58.312 --> 24:00.313
You don't need to decide
right now.

24:01.649 --> 24:03.650
I'll-I'll wait for your call.

24:03.734 --> 24:05.902
And thanks again, Bill.
Yep.

24:07.238 --> 24:08.738
Fuck!

24:15.412 --> 24:17.122
I thought you'd gone to bed.

24:17.206 --> 24:20.667
- I have to talk to you.
- I'm almost finished.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.462
SecDef is being
a total pain in the ass.

24:24.588 --> 24:28.091
Martha, I need
to talk to you now.
Something wrong?

24:28.175 --> 24:31.344
No. No, the opposite. I‒
I finally got some good news.

24:32.388 --> 24:34.055
What?

24:34.140 --> 24:36.224
GW has offered me
my old job back.

24:37.768 --> 24:39.769
- They have?
- Mm-hmm.

24:39.854 --> 24:41.354
My period of exile
is over.

24:41.438 --> 24:44.107
Bill Nicholas himself called.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.317
- When was this?
- This afternoon.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.778
He was up early.

24:48.863 --> 24:50.363
Martha,
I'm not lying to you.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.282
Talk to him yourself
if you don't believe me.

24:52.366 --> 24:54.701
He wants me back
as soon as possible.

24:57.621 --> 25:00.665
So, what does "as soon
as possible" mean?

25:00.749 --> 25:02.750
Early next week.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.836
Faculty meetings
have already started.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.462
So, you're just
gonna... leave?

25:06.547 --> 25:09.007
You're gonna abandon
all your teaching commitments
and everything else?

25:09.091 --> 25:11.009
Come on. I can't
say no to this.

25:11.093 --> 25:14.262
Yeah, well, do you think
our marriage can survive
another separation?

25:14.388 --> 25:18.433
I think that our marriage could
put my career first for once.
We tried that.

25:18.517 --> 25:21.269
You ended up plagiarizing
an entire chapter of your book.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.688
That will not happen again.

25:27.401 --> 25:29.110
Plus, there's Toby
to consider.

25:30.154 --> 25:31.863
Don't bring him into this.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.489
He's away from home
for the first time.

25:33.574 --> 25:37.285
One of us should be there
for him, don't you think?
Or both of us?

25:37.369 --> 25:40.038
You know damn well I can't
leave in the middle of my tour.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.959
I have spent my whole life
following you around.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.837
- This is a ridiculous
conversation.
- Is it?

25:47.922 --> 25:51.216
Well,
I've already said yes.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.468
Figured as much.

25:53.594 --> 25:55.595
I'm leaving
next week.
Fine.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.847
Fine.

26:05.606 --> 26:07.857
I thought you should know.

26:07.942 --> 26:09.692
Now I know.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.759
You did
the psych eval too?

26:36.011 --> 26:38.972
I just have
my very last polygraph.
Then I'm out.

26:39.056 --> 26:40.807
Jesus, Quinn.

26:44.687 --> 26:47.730
I guess I'm even more grateful
that you're here now.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.607
Anything for you, Carrie.

26:49.692 --> 26:53.319
Is that the real reason
you didn't come with me to Kabul‒

26:53.404 --> 26:55.488
you already had
one foot out the door?

26:56.740 --> 26:59.284
Mostly, I just didn't want
to live in a bunker and...

26:59.368 --> 27:01.369
kill people
by remote control.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.458
That's harsh.

27:08.335 --> 27:11.004
Ever since
that kid in Caracas,

27:11.088 --> 27:12.880
covert operations
have been over for me.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.966
I thought they were anyway.

27:16.593 --> 27:19.345
You have to let yourself off
the hook for that one, Quinn.

27:21.181 --> 27:25.226
At least I know his name.
Carlos Cedeño.

27:25.311 --> 27:28.646
I don't even remember
half the others.

27:28.731 --> 27:32.817
You took the fight to the enemy
and saved lives in the process.

27:32.901 --> 27:34.902
Or just made more enemies.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.613
Either way, I was pretty far
down the fucking rabbit hole.

27:37.698 --> 27:39.699
- Come on, Quinn.
- I'm serious.

27:41.035 --> 27:43.036
It was like a drug.

27:43.120 --> 27:46.331
You know,
going from one mission
to the next like that.

27:46.415 --> 27:49.375
You want to believe
you were such a bad guy?
Go ahead.

27:49.460 --> 27:52.545
- I was a bad guy.
- Stop it.

27:56.884 --> 27:58.634
Why are you doing this?

27:58.719 --> 28:01.179
Maybe because
you need to hear it.

28:01.263 --> 28:03.973
What I need, Quinn,
is your help.

28:04.058 --> 28:05.975
Not your goddamn foot
on the brake.

28:06.060 --> 28:09.354
So, who's on doom watch,
and who's going back
to the embassy?

28:17.780 --> 28:19.280
Quinn?

28:19.365 --> 28:21.574
Uh, you go, I'll stay.

28:22.576 --> 28:24.077
You sure?

28:28.999 --> 28:32.251
- All right. Good night then.
- Good night.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.242
Fara.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.746
Fara.
Mmm?

29:09.748 --> 29:11.916
The night shift's
coming out.

29:12.042 --> 29:15.044
I need a bathroom.
Not yet, you don't.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.423
There's that nurse.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.935
Where's Aayan?

29:39.278 --> 29:42.447
Hand-off complete.
Hand-off of what, only God knows.

29:42.531 --> 29:46.409
It's a hospital, Max.
Probably drugs of
some kind. Medicine.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.703
- He's moving.
- Hurry.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.955
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

30:05.429 --> 30:08.431
Can we call off the dogs,
please?
Good morning to you too.

30:08.515 --> 30:10.266
I have enough trouble
shaking ISI tails...

30:10.350 --> 30:13.019
without having to worry about
losing my own people as well.

30:13.145 --> 30:16.397
The idea was to watch your back,
so you didn't wind up
like Sandy.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.275
- Then why not come right out
and tell me about it?
- We knew you'd say no.

30:19.359 --> 30:21.444
Well, now I am saying no.

30:21.528 --> 30:23.196
Okay.

30:23.280 --> 30:26.657
I don't see you
having much trouble getting
in and out of the embassy.

30:33.707 --> 30:35.958
There's a tunnel.

30:36.043 --> 30:38.794
- A tunnel?
- It starts under
the Economics section.

30:38.879 --> 30:41.255
Dumps you out
into the Itwar Bazar.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.508
Why didn't you say something?

30:44.051 --> 30:45.801
You never asked.

31:36.311 --> 31:37.812
Hey.

31:41.692 --> 31:43.609
What the fuck is this?

32:05.591 --> 32:07.049
Bunny sent you.

32:07.134 --> 32:10.928
General Latif asked me
to spare you some time.

32:11.013 --> 32:14.557
- What do you want?
- Talk to you about
Sandy Bachman.

32:14.683 --> 32:17.518
What about him?
His death.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.437
Actually, his murder.

32:21.648 --> 32:25.067
Answer me something,
if you would.
Of course.

32:25.152 --> 32:26.902
Who's speaking here?

32:27.988 --> 32:29.947
Is this Saul Berenson,
the private citizen?

32:30.032 --> 32:33.659
Is it Saul Berenson,
ex-director of the CIA?

32:33.744 --> 32:35.578
Is it Carrie Mathison?

32:35.662 --> 32:37.997
Who's speaking, please?

32:38.081 --> 32:40.458
Why was Sandy Bachman
murdered?

32:40.542 --> 32:44.045
You tell me that,
and I'll tell you who's speaking here.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.839
Hmm.

32:46.923 --> 32:49.550
Well, usually
the simplest explanation
is the correct one.

32:49.635 --> 32:52.762
- Which is?
- He was recognized
on the street...

32:52.846 --> 32:54.764
and killed in anger
over a drone strike.

32:54.890 --> 32:56.974
Official story.
The truth.

32:57.100 --> 33:00.436
With one important omission.
What?

33:00.520 --> 33:03.856
There was an ISI operative
on the ground that day,
in the crowd.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.441
Not just by chance.

33:05.525 --> 33:08.402
He was conducting
the whole bloody orchestra.

33:10.697 --> 33:13.908
- You know this how?
- I've seen the evidence.

33:13.992 --> 33:17.203
- It's compelling.
- What evidence?

33:17.287 --> 33:19.121
An eyewitness? A photograph?
Show me.

33:19.206 --> 33:21.666
Photographs can be forged,
eyewitnesses paid for.

33:23.377 --> 33:25.378
You're a bright young man.

33:26.421 --> 33:28.839
This would explain
a lot.
About what?

33:28.924 --> 33:32.343
The timing of the leak
of Sandy Bachman's picture
to the press.

33:32.427 --> 33:36.889
The fact that the other
two intelligence officers
in the car weren't also killed.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.974
As a former official
of the United States,

33:39.059 --> 33:41.435
you're drawing
some pretty damn
unofficial conclusions.

33:41.520 --> 33:45.981
Wouldn't be the first time
your service has targeted
one of our people.

33:46.066 --> 33:49.402
- Or vice versa.
- Was it you?

33:49.486 --> 33:51.320
You give the order?

33:51.446 --> 33:56.325
As a favor to the general,
I agreed to a chat, Mr. Berenson,
not an interrogation.

33:57.411 --> 33:58.911
Good day.

34:17.097 --> 34:19.348
Where's our guy?

34:19.433 --> 34:22.518
Went out for breakfast.
He's back now.
He's on the Internet.

34:22.602 --> 34:26.313
Well, I just got off
the phone with Saul.
Consider the pot stirred.

34:26.398 --> 34:29.525
If anything's gonna happen,
it's gonna happen today,
and soon.

34:30.944 --> 34:33.446
Hey, Quinn,
can I talk to you
for a second?

34:43.832 --> 34:46.167
About last night...
Forget it.

34:46.251 --> 34:50.796
No. You didn't want
to come back here.
I get that now.

34:52.132 --> 34:56.010
So, thanks for coming
in spite of that.
It means a lot.

34:56.094 --> 34:59.013
Not to mention
we'd be nowhere on this
if it wasn't for you.

34:59.139 --> 35:01.599
We may still be nowhere.
Mmm.

35:01.683 --> 35:04.101
You know what I mean.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.523
So, we good?

35:12.402 --> 35:14.153
Yeah, we're good.

35:41.515 --> 35:45.601
You see him?
Yeah. He's just
as stuck as we are.

35:50.232 --> 35:52.024
He's getting out of the car.

35:55.028 --> 35:57.488
We're gonna lose him.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.869
Don't do anything stupid.
It's not worth it.

37:47.682 --> 37:50.559
Quinn!
Target's getting a call.

37:50.644 --> 37:52.102
Qadir!

37:54.397 --> 37:57.232
- Salaam alaikum.
- Hello?

38:05.659 --> 38:08.827
Quinn, what did she say?
His laundry's ready for pickup.

38:14.125 --> 38:17.836
He's killing his comms.
That was an exit code.
Who was the caller?

38:19.464 --> 38:21.423
We're not getting it.
Quinn!

38:21.508 --> 38:23.884
- Nothing. No trace.
- Well, how is that
even possible?

38:23.969 --> 38:25.135
He's running.

38:26.054 --> 38:28.305
Fuck! Fuck!

38:33.061 --> 38:34.561
We have to take him.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.397
- What?
- We take him now.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.524
- You fucking kidding me?
- We don't have a choice.

38:38.650 --> 38:42.653
He walks out that door,
out walks our only chance
to connect the ISI to Sandy's murder.

38:42.737 --> 38:45.656
- It's way too dangerous.
- What? He's one guy.
There's four of us.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.200
- He's a trained hood
who knows he just got made.
- We can do it.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.035
Not without somebody
getting hurt.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.746
All right, fine.
We'll do it without you.

38:52.872 --> 38:54.289
Parvez, Qadir,
come on.
No!

38:54.416 --> 38:57.084
Get your hands off me!
For all you know,
he's got backup on the way!

38:57.168 --> 39:00.212
Backup?
Did you hear one word
about backup on that call?

39:00.338 --> 39:02.589
Fara's on the line.
Not now.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.174
She says it's urgent.

39:10.724 --> 39:13.726
- I can't talk to you.
- Haissam Haqqani's alive.

39:13.810 --> 39:16.603
- What?
- Haqqani is alive.

39:16.688 --> 39:20.107
That's impossible.
He was killed in the air strike.

39:20.191 --> 39:23.110
Well, I just saw him
walk out of a madrassa
with Aayan Ibrahim.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.030
He was with Aayan?
Yes, they embraced.

39:26.114 --> 39:29.616
And then Haqqani
drove off in an SUV.

39:31.453 --> 39:34.955
- Are you 100% sure?
- Check your e-mail.
I just sent you a video.

39:37.917 --> 39:39.626
Guys, he's leaving
the apartment.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.170
Want us to go after him?
Just wait.

39:41.254 --> 39:42.755
- We're gonna lose him.
- Then we lose him.

39:42.839 --> 39:44.590
We may have
a game changer here.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.229
Is that Haqqani?

40:00.190 --> 40:01.774
Yeah.

40:04.694 --> 40:06.403
But we killed him.

40:06.488 --> 40:08.614
And the Taliban
said we killed him.

40:12.869 --> 40:15.954
- Fara, are you still there?
- I'm here.

40:16.039 --> 40:19.541
I'm assuming
you couldn't follow him.
No, I'm on foot.

40:19.626 --> 40:22.169
- What about Aayan?
- Heading back the way he came.

40:22.253 --> 40:25.547
Okay, get back to the office
as soon as you can
in case he shows up there.

40:25.632 --> 40:27.382
And, Fara, good work.

40:31.805 --> 40:33.514
What the fuck, Carrie?

40:33.598 --> 40:35.349
Tell me what you're thinking
right now.

40:35.433 --> 40:38.852
That Sandy's death
actually makes sense
for the first time.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.313
He was killed in order
to protect Haqqani,

40:41.397 --> 40:44.608
who either survived
the air strike or
wasn't there in the first place.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.860
He wasn't there.

40:46.945 --> 40:50.030
- They played us
from the very beginning.
- But why do any of it?

40:50.115 --> 40:52.825
Because that's when we
stop tracking terrorists‒
when we think they're dead.

40:54.244 --> 40:57.371
I get why the Taliban wants us
to think that, but why the ISI?

40:58.289 --> 41:00.666
That's a great fucking question.

41:14.013 --> 41:17.015
Hello, Professor.
Please come in.

41:21.020 --> 41:23.272
Hey!

41:23.356 --> 41:25.524
I don't like asking twice.

41:25.608 --> 41:28.235
I am the husband of
the American ambassador,

41:28.319 --> 41:31.655
and you-you are risking
a serious diplomatic incident.

41:35.243 --> 41:38.203
- What do you want?
- I've told you already.

41:38.288 --> 41:40.289
And I told you
I'm not the guy.

41:40.373 --> 41:42.499
Plus, I'm leaving,
as you can see.

41:42.584 --> 41:45.460
Actually, you're not.
You've had a change of heart.

41:45.545 --> 41:47.254
Hmm.

42:00.768 --> 42:02.895
I demand
to make a phone call.

42:02.979 --> 42:04.479
Of course.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.068
Go ahead.

42:11.696 --> 42:14.406
But here's what happens
if you do.

42:14.490 --> 42:18.911
A package arrives
at the FBI headquarters
in Washington, DC.

42:18.995 --> 42:23.123
Inside are
the documents you stole
from your wife's computer...

42:23.208 --> 42:27.252
and a timeline
implicating you
in their theft.

42:27.337 --> 42:31.465
You're arrested for treason
and your wife's career
is destroyed by association.

42:37.180 --> 42:38.931
Who are you?

42:40.099 --> 42:42.559
Call me Tasneem.

42:42.644 --> 42:44.436
Beyond that,
it's better you don't know.

42:53.154 --> 42:54.905
Dennis?

42:57.075 --> 42:59.076
Here's my promise to you.

43:00.453 --> 43:03.038
Once you've done
all I've asked,

43:03.122 --> 43:07.960
you can leave Islamabad
without any further obligations.

43:08.836 --> 43:11.213
A free man.

43:11.297 --> 43:14.800
Neither the FBI
nor your wife
will ever know.

43:22.433 --> 43:25.936
What's this?
This is how we begin.

43:28.398 --> 43:30.607
Don't worry.
Aayan will be back.

43:30.733 --> 43:33.151
How can you be sure?
Because he's desperate.

43:33.236 --> 43:35.946
And because he would've
gone with Haqqani
if that was an option.

43:36.072 --> 43:38.073
Are you coming, Max?
Coming.

43:38.157 --> 43:39.992
Max is gonna take me
to the safe house.

43:40.076 --> 43:43.120
You wait here in case
Aayan shows up.
Okay.

43:43.204 --> 43:46.581
And if he does show,
bring him by.
I don't care how late it is.

43:46.666 --> 43:49.459
Should I get started on
a passport and visa for him?

43:49.585 --> 43:51.795
No.
Why not?

43:51.879 --> 43:53.588
He's not going anywhere,
Fara.

43:53.673 --> 43:55.882
But we promised him
safe passage to England.

43:55.967 --> 43:58.635
That's before we caught him
aiding and abetting
a known jihadi.

43:58.720 --> 44:02.723
Haqqani's his uncle, Carrie.
For all we know, that medicine
is for one of his cousins.

44:03.725 --> 44:06.685
Do you know what
a stalking horse is?

44:06.769 --> 44:10.022
It's a decoy
used to hide behind
while hunting your quarry.

44:11.190 --> 44:12.649
I don't understand.

44:12.734 --> 44:16.862
We're gonna hide
right behind Aayan,
all the way back to his uncle.

44:16.946 --> 44:19.239
But he'll never agree.

44:20.033 --> 44:22.075
Let me worry
about that.

44:22.160 --> 44:24.661
You just get him
to the safe house.

45:13.753 --> 45:15.754
Aayan, come in.

45:19.550 --> 45:21.259
See you tomorrow.

45:28.810 --> 45:31.144
Everything okay?
Yeah.

45:31.229 --> 45:33.271
I guess, yeah.

45:34.107 --> 45:36.108
You did what you needed to?

45:41.697 --> 45:43.698
Anything else
I can do to help?

45:43.783 --> 45:45.492
No, I don't think so.

45:45.576 --> 45:49.246
Thanks‒
Thanks for the money though.
I'll pay you back.

45:50.957 --> 45:53.792
- Here, let me take that.
- No, it's‒ it's okay.

45:56.546 --> 45:59.089
So this is
where you'll stay.

45:59.173 --> 46:02.259
I‒ I thought
we were going to London.

46:02.343 --> 46:05.053
We are, once I get you
a passport and a visa.

46:05.179 --> 46:08.765
But you‒
you said right away.
Well, this is right away.

46:08.850 --> 46:11.268
We're talking about
two days, three at the max,
then we're gone.

46:11.352 --> 46:14.813
- Three days‒
- Aayan, you're safe here.

46:24.365 --> 46:27.451
I'm‒ I'm gonna move
into a hotel tomorrow.
I'll give you some privacy.

46:27.535 --> 46:30.412
But for now, let's‒

46:30.496 --> 46:32.372
let's make up the couch.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.666
What do you say?

46:36.335 --> 46:37.586
Okay.

46:38.838 --> 46:41.298
I'll be right back
with some sheets
and a pillow.

47:06.491 --> 47:08.074
All right.

47:09.202 --> 47:10.911
Come on, give me a hand.

47:30.806 --> 47:34.309
Here.
You take that end.

47:43.736 --> 47:45.237
Sorry.

47:57.166 --> 47:58.458
Yeah.

48:03.589 --> 48:05.090
There.

48:06.592 --> 48:09.427
You must be exhausted.
You should get some rest.

48:14.559 --> 48:18.812
Look, I know it doesn't
feel like that right now,
but it's all gonna work out.

48:21.107 --> 48:22.941
The worst is over.

48:24.193 --> 48:26.361
You deserve a little‒

48:29.532 --> 48:31.116
grace.

48:38.291 --> 48:40.458
Hey, what is it, Aayan?

48:44.046 --> 48:46.590
Something I didn't tell you.

48:46.674 --> 48:48.508
I should've told you.

48:53.139 --> 48:55.056
What?

48:55.141 --> 48:59.936
I got kicked out of my, uh‒
my medical school.

49:01.272 --> 49:03.815
When did that happen?
Yesterday.

49:03.899 --> 49:05.400
For what reason?

49:05.484 --> 49:09.362
They're claiming
I stole medicines
from the hospital pharmacy.

49:09.488 --> 49:12.032
I didn't do that.
It's a lie.
Hey.

49:12.992 --> 49:15.452
It's okay.
No, I-I didn't do it.

49:15.578 --> 49:18.580
I believe you.
Hmm.

49:19.457 --> 49:21.166
What about King's College?

49:21.250 --> 49:24.252
Won't this affect
my chances of getting in?

49:25.129 --> 49:27.172
No.

49:27.256 --> 49:29.049
Really?

49:29.133 --> 49:31.176
Really.

49:32.678 --> 49:35.347
How‒
How's that possible?

49:38.643 --> 49:40.769
Trust me.

49:40.853 --> 49:43.980
I'll make them
understand.

49:47.234 --> 49:50.737
Hey, try not
to worry so much.

50:01.874 --> 50:04.042
Wh-What are you doing?

50:09.882 --> 50:12.050
Nothing.

50:33.489 --> 50:35.240
Is that okay?

50:38.327 --> 50:40.078
I don't know.

50:42.081 --> 50:45.083
You've never done this before.

50:46.794 --> 50:48.294
No.

50:57.847 --> 50:59.431
Hey.
