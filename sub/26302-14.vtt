We need to immediately
start you on chemo.

00:20.455 --> 00:21.978
Andre has cancer.

00:23.762 --> 00:26.113
You think I"d miss
your performance?

00:26.156 --> 00:28.202
- I can tell you like her.
- She"s into you, too.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.943
Are you drinking alone?

00:30.987 --> 00:32.162
I hope not.

00:32.206 --> 00:33.357
Treasure, what are you doing?

00:33.381 --> 00:34.730
No, this is not okay.

00:34.773 --> 00:36.340
You little dirty bitch!

00:41.519 --> 00:44.218
Andre never showed
with my money.

00:44.261 --> 00:45.784
He"s not the talented one.

You see Ben Simmons
pass up another jumper?

00:57.274 --> 00:59.885
Man, I don"t understand why he
just don"t use his right hand.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.235
Right?

01:01.278 --> 01:03.150
- Give me a smoke?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03.193 --> 01:05.717
What"s up, fellas?

01:05.761 --> 01:08.981
- Y"all looking for a light?
- Damn. Lucious Lyon?

01:09.025 --> 01:11.984
I mean,
I"m sorry to bother you, sir,

01:12.028 --> 01:13.266
but we heard the show was great.

01:13.290 --> 01:14.596
- Thank you, brother.
- Yeah.

01:26.173 --> 01:28.262
- All right.
- Thanks, man. Appreciate it.

01:28.305 --> 01:30.394
- To the Empire.
- Yeah. Did you see that?

01:30.438 --> 01:31.613
That was crazy, man.

01:31.656 --> 01:34.006
Yeah, man.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.159
What you doing here?

01:56.203 --> 01:58.727
Is that really what you want
to do right now?

02:01.033 --> 02:03.253
Ask questions?

02:10.347 --> 02:13.045
Took your ass long enough, man.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.177
Sorry, sorry.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.266
- You know the routine.
- Yes, sir.

02:16.310 --> 02:18.790
Personal effects burned,
limbs scattered.

02:20.052 --> 02:21.228
We can"t afford

02:21.271 --> 02:23.317
any mistakes this time.

02:23.360 --> 02:28.191
With Conway and AUSA
all over my ass.

02:53.085 --> 02:55.218
Come on, Cook.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.481
It"s Cook, you know what to do.

02:57.525 --> 02:59.875
Damn.

03:02.094 --> 03:03.661
Front desk,
how can I assist you?

03:03.705 --> 03:05.272
This is Lucious Lyon.
Did my wife

03:05.315 --> 03:07.361
check into another room
last night?

03:07.404 --> 03:11.669
I"m sorry, sir, but we don't
have any record of that.

03:11.713 --> 03:14.324
- Wow!
- "If Squeal Street."

03:14.368 --> 03:16.457
- Could Talk."See that...
- Disrespect.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.589
Put some respect
on James Baldwin. Come on.

03:18.633 --> 03:21.070
Straight people need to bestopped, babe.
Ain"t that right?

03:21.113 --> 03:23.115
Yeah, you must be stopped, too.

03:23.159 --> 03:24.595
- Back up off me.
- Look... Okay,

03:24.639 --> 03:26.684
but Hakeem"s taking care
of the production meeting,

03:26.728 --> 03:30.862
and you don"t have to be
at your sound check for hours.

03:32.777 --> 03:34.953
Jamal...

03:37.304 --> 03:39.958
Yo, I put the "Do Not Disturb"
thing on.

03:40.002 --> 03:42.787
This is your father, Mal.

03:47.357 --> 03:50.055
Yes! That"s what
I"m talking about!

03:50.099 --> 03:51.666
You see the difference?

03:51.709 --> 03:55.104
Go ahead and get water, ladies. Good job.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.414
Dad, what"s up?

04:00.457 --> 04:02.416
Jamal"s meeting you
in the lobby.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.200
I need you guys on a plane

04:04.244 --> 04:06.768
and back in New York
at home immediately.

04:06.811 --> 04:09.379
Okay.

04:13.601 --> 04:17.560
Lucious probably hid his
dirty-ass cash in these walls.

04:17.605 --> 04:20.956
It"s supposed to be
mycommunity center.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.523
What is with the mood?

04:22.566 --> 04:25.439
I thought you and Luce would
beriding high off opening night.

04:25.482 --> 04:28.659
I don"t owe you or nobody else
any explanations, okay?

04:28.703 --> 04:29.791
I"m grown.

04:29.834 --> 04:32.359
Maybe not,
but that little unwashed face

04:32.402 --> 04:34.361
and last night"s clothes
owes to something.

04:34.404 --> 04:35.686
So what, you"ve been out
all night?

04:35.710 --> 04:38.350
- Did a little horseback?
- Ooh, you... no, but I should hit you...

04:42.412 --> 04:44.109
I ain"t got time...

04:44.153 --> 04:45.502
What"s that about?

04:51.508 --> 04:54.598
It"s Lucious.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.600
What you want me to do?

04:56.644 --> 04:58.733
He ain"t got nothing to say
I want to hear.

04:58.776 --> 05:03.955
Hey, Luce. Listen, right now isnot
the... it"s not a good time.

05:05.217 --> 05:06.741
Wait, Cook.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.310
It"s Andre.

05:15.271 --> 05:17.969
Stage IV lymphoma
never sounds good,

05:18.013 --> 05:22.191
but, um, but thanks to Teri,
I"m on an aggressive cycle

05:22.234 --> 05:24.019
of doxorubicin.

05:24.062 --> 05:27.414
Anthracycline antibiotics can
have aggressive side effects,

05:27.457 --> 05:29.087
but so far, my symptoms
are all within the range

05:29.111 --> 05:31.635
- of what Dr. Swain expected.
- Dre, I"m sorry,

05:31.679 --> 05:33.657
you know, how are youfeeling? Well,
he gonna feel a whole lot better

05:33.681 --> 05:35.485
now that we in the mix,
"cause, baby, we gonna get"

05:35.509 --> 05:36.573
the best doctors in the world,

05:36.597 --> 05:38.096
and they gonna be
at your beck and call.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.426
Ma, I already have a plan.

05:39.469 --> 05:40.644
- It"s all...
- No, no,

05:40.688 --> 05:42.167
we about to turn this house

05:42.211 --> 05:44.953
into the best treatment facility
that you"ve ever seen.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.670
That way, me and your mama,
we can be with you

05:46.694 --> 05:48.652
- every step of the way.
- Yes,

05:48.696 --> 05:50.219
and I"m gonna
rearrange my schedule.

05:50.262 --> 05:51.762
And that Giselle,
she can finally step up

05:51.786 --> 05:54.745
and-and earn that bogus title,
or whatever she is that...

05:54.789 --> 05:57.095
We ain "t going nowhere.-I" m
not asking for that, though.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.204
- You know what I"m saying?
- Jamal, you got the tour. What are you talking about?

05:59.228 --> 06:00.988
- Forget a tour, I don "t know
her.-JAMAL Yeah. Ain"t no thinking

06:01.012 --> 06:03.014
- about a damn tour right now, man.
- Stop!

06:05.669 --> 06:08.063
See, this is exactly why
I didn"t want to tell anybody

06:08.106 --> 06:10.282
I was sick.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.023
Empire"s entire existence

06:12.067 --> 06:14.765
depends on this tour, and the
tour depends on its headli...

06:14.809 --> 06:16.308
Okay, baby. Baby, baby, please,
don"t-don't make yourself upset.

06:16.332 --> 06:19.030
We can talk about this calmly,
man.

06:19.074 --> 06:21.337
- Please.
- I need a break.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.836
- Andre, please, come on...
- I need a break, Ma.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.122
Andre.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.776
- Andre.
- Dre?

06:25.820 --> 06:28.518
No, hold on. Dre.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.434
Now, do you mind telling me

06:31.478 --> 06:33.915
where in the hell
you were last night?

06:33.958 --> 06:36.570
I searched everywhere for you.

06:36.613 --> 06:39.181
Dre? Dre.

06:41.879 --> 06:44.708
- Man, I"m so sorry.
- It"s okay.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.318
You know,
what-what happened in there

06:46.362 --> 06:48.320
with Lucious and Cookie, I...

06:48.364 --> 06:51.715
I expected that.

06:51.759 --> 06:54.065
It"s gonna be a lot
for them to handle,

06:54.109 --> 06:55.632
which is why I need you two

06:55.676 --> 06:58.766
to step up
and pick up the slack.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.857
Empire"s your birthright.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.728
It"s your moment.

07:04.772 --> 07:07.557
Show me you"re ready
to lead this tour.

07:10.299 --> 07:11.474
Come here.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.171
Come on, come on.

07:13.215 --> 07:14.738
Come here, Hakeem.

07:15.870 --> 07:18.525
Now, I love y"all.

07:19.351 --> 07:20.657
You hear me?

07:20.701 --> 07:22.137
Always.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.574
I need you to believe

07:24.618 --> 07:27.490
that I"m gonna be fine

07:27.534 --> 07:31.712
so I can believe it, too.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.627
Okay?

07:35.629 --> 07:37.587
Okay?

07:41.809 --> 07:43.724
Okay.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.777
Look, Cookie,
you got to just-just stop

07:53.821 --> 07:55.233
- and listen to me, please.
- I can"t. Dr. Swain's team

07:55.257 --> 07:57.346
will be here any moment
to set up Andre"s chemo.

07:57.389 --> 07:59.304
- Okay?
- Look, no, no.

07:59.348 --> 08:02.220
I need you to listen to me.

08:02.264 --> 08:04.701
Nothing happened
between me and Treasure.

08:04.745 --> 08:06.573
- I swear.
- So, then,

08:06.616 --> 08:10.707
she must have tripped
and fallen on top of you.

08:10.751 --> 08:14.319
- Wow, she really is talented.
- No, no. No, no, you...

08:14.363 --> 08:17.366
She was confused
about her gratitude,

08:17.409 --> 08:18.822
and she tried something
and made a mistake,

08:18.846 --> 08:20.151
but I stopped her.

08:20.195 --> 08:22.371
I swear.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.331
That sounds real nice.

08:26.375 --> 08:28.595
Just like it sounded nice

08:28.638 --> 08:31.728
when you said you were sleeping
with Giuliana for me.

08:33.687 --> 08:37.429
- Honey...
- Your words aren"t enough anymore, Lucious.

08:37.472 --> 08:39.344
No, look, I-I need you

08:39.388 --> 08:41.390
to believe me right now.
I really do.

08:41.433 --> 08:44.436
That sounds like
a "you" problem, Lucious.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.569
The only thing I have energy for

08:46.613 --> 08:50.312
is to care for our firstborn.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.361
That"s right.

08:56.405 --> 08:58.494
He"s not your firstborn.

09:11.638 --> 09:14.815
Blistering around the IV site
is common.

09:14.858 --> 09:16.164
Is it bothering you?

09:16.207 --> 09:17.644
No more than the vomiting.

09:17.687 --> 09:21.735
We"ve been icing the area
everynight to control the swelling.

09:21.778 --> 09:22.649
Um, Doc,

09:22.692 --> 09:25.652
I see you have Andre
on a CHOP regimen.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.088
Why not a CVP?

09:27.131 --> 09:28.829
CVP is an option

09:28.872 --> 09:30.308
for follicular lymphoma,

09:30.352 --> 09:32.746
but given Andre"s
advanced diagnosis,

09:32.789 --> 09:34.617
the addition of doxorubicin
is essential.

09:34.661 --> 09:39.013
Well, um,
what about immunotherapy?

09:39.056 --> 09:42.103
Andre"s antibody production
has been strong so far.

09:42.146 --> 09:43.887
After this chemo round,

09:43.931 --> 09:46.760
we"ll assess his blood work
to see if he qualifies

09:46.803 --> 09:48.631
for phase 2 of the trial,
and if he does,

09:48.675 --> 09:50.894
we"ll incorporate rituximab.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.766
Rituxi...

09:54.158 --> 09:56.770
What if he doesn"t qualify?

10:00.251 --> 10:02.123
We"ll explore every option.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.781
Here we go.

10:13.700 --> 10:17.486
Why don"t you go on over
to Empire, Pop?

10:17.529 --> 10:20.228
Manage
the initial tour reception.

10:20.271 --> 10:22.752
Really.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.667
You all right?

10:24.711 --> 10:27.191
Yeah, Pop. I"m good.

10:28.192 --> 10:30.586
Yeah. Not a bad idea.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.808
- Hey, Cook, you coming?
- No.

10:34.851 --> 10:37.071
I"m right here
where I need to be.

10:37.114 --> 10:39.508
Juanita, um,

10:39.551 --> 10:41.902
can you tell themto bring
the car around, please?

10:41.945 --> 10:44.121
Right away, sir.

10:51.128 --> 10:52.739
It"s okay.

10:52.782 --> 10:55.567
- Where the hell is my jacket?
- What?

10:55.611 --> 10:57.961
- Look, I can"t hear you.
- How can you hear anything

10:58.005 --> 10:59.156
with little man coughing
like that?

10:59.180 --> 11:00.964
I haven"t slept in days.

11:01.008 --> 11:02.768
How am I supposed to bring it
at this open mic tonight?

11:02.792 --> 11:05.577
Well, I"m sorry that our son
issuch an inconvenience for you.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.318
So do something about it.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.722
What do you want me
to do, Lucious?

11:08.755 --> 11:10.104
We-we can"t afford a doctor.

11:10.147 --> 11:11.409
I can"t take him anywhere.

11:11.453 --> 11:12.846
Look, you know what I need?

11:12.889 --> 11:14.369
I need your help. Not your lip.

11:14.412 --> 11:17.938
Every second I"m not working
on my music,

11:17.981 --> 11:19.301
I"m out on these
streets hustling,

11:19.330 --> 11:22.725
to keep a roof over your"s
heads. That"s me helping.

12:07.509 --> 12:08.902
The hell"s wrong with you?

12:08.945 --> 12:10.338
I had a rough night, man.

12:10.381 --> 12:12.906
I"ll be good,
I"ll be good by showtime.

12:12.949 --> 12:15.691
Go... go clean yourself up
or something, go ahead.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.867
Go. Go.

12:20.043 --> 12:22.872
Did you see the reviews
for the VIP meet and greet?

12:22.916 --> 12:24.482
Yeah, I"ll, I'll get to it.

12:24.526 --> 12:27.703
Also, the dancers arecomplaining
about their motels.

12:27.747 --> 12:28.704
Porsha, do you really think
this is something

12:28.748 --> 12:30.073
we need to be discussing
right now?

12:30.097 --> 12:31.489
Okay.

12:31.533 --> 12:33.927
Porsha. Tell the hotels that

12:33.970 --> 12:35.469
we"ll-we'll stay at their
locations on the rest

12:35.493 --> 12:36.732
of the trip if they give us
a discount.

12:36.756 --> 12:41.456
Hey. You killing it. A"ight?
We got this.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.417
- Thanks, guys.
- You can take five.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.680
Tia, it just needs to be
louderin the house. That"s it.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.813
- April?
- What up, Tee?

12:50.857 --> 12:52.510
Hey, so, the lights?

12:52.554 --> 12:54.817
- Out of control. I can"t see anything.
- Yo, Tia.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.906
Thought you might
need the boost.

12:56.950 --> 12:59.648
Look. I don"t do dairy
when I"m performing,

12:59.691 --> 13:01.693
and I don"t repeat mistakes.

13:01.737 --> 13:05.915
Especially mistakes
that name their junk.

13:07.003 --> 13:08.048
So, about this...

13:08.091 --> 13:10.267
There you are.
I"ve been calling and texting

13:10.311 --> 13:12.748
to get some more
of that mutual respect.

13:17.144 --> 13:18.014
Andre"s sick.

13:18.058 --> 13:20.103
He has stage IV lymphoma.

13:20.147 --> 13:21.539
What?

13:21.583 --> 13:23.759
God, I"m-I'm so sorry, Jamal.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.519
Are you... are you okay?
Do you need me to take you...

13:25.543 --> 13:27.545
No, no, no, no.
I have to stay with the tour.

13:27.589 --> 13:29.896
It"s all hands on deck right now.
. Okay.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.419
I"m coming, I'm coming.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.900
Wait, hey, hey.
Hey, just take a deep breath.

13:33.943 --> 13:36.704
I can"t right now, all right?-Hey, just
stay, stay here withme for a minute.

13:36.728 --> 13:38.643
It"s like you said, it's...

13:38.687 --> 13:40.645
it"s the Lyon family drama.

13:40.689 --> 13:42.996
Yeah, o-okay, well,
we"ll just talk later.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.345
No.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.263
Kai, I loved seeing you
and being with you last night.

13:51.091 --> 13:54.311
It"s day one, though, and I
can"t even find time for us,

13:54.355 --> 13:56.096
and that just...

13:56.139 --> 13:58.272
that just makes me
feel horrible.

13:59.926 --> 14:02.102
- Well...
- And there"s...

14:02.145 --> 14:06.149
That, on top of everything
else, would be unbearable.

14:06.193 --> 14:09.326
So I just think that you
were right all along, that...

14:09.370 --> 14:12.112
being a Lyon comes first.

14:12.155 --> 14:13.591
I got to go.

14:23.079 --> 14:24.689
Lucious?

14:24.733 --> 14:27.475
Hey, they told me you here.
I thought you"d be with Andre.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.477
Yeah, I know. I left Andre

14:29.520 --> 14:31.305
in the hands of professionals.

14:31.348 --> 14:33.916
I wish I could say that
about Empire.

14:33.960 --> 14:34.961
Excuse me?

14:35.004 --> 14:37.528
We"re three months away
from extinction,

14:37.572 --> 14:39.922
and all I see here
is handfuls of...

14:39.966 --> 14:42.620
of mediocrity and complacency.

14:42.664 --> 14:45.928
Generating ecstatic headlines
isn"t complacency, okay?

14:45.972 --> 14:48.975
The New York Postcalled us
a "Freenomenon."

14:49.018 --> 14:53.066
Almost every single review
called Treasure the breakout.

14:53.109 --> 14:56.025
Yeah, then we have a problem,
because we"re dropping her.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.853
- What?
- Let"s just say

14:57.897 --> 15:00.638
she behaved inappropriately
after the after-party,

15:00.682 --> 15:04.077
and she"s now a liability
to this company.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.208
Whatever it is she did,

15:05.252 --> 15:07.210
it never made it
to the gossip blogs.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.082
Lucious, she"s not a liability.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.648
She"s an asset.

15:10.692 --> 15:13.564
Okay. Then she shouldn"t havea
problem finding another label.

15:13.608 --> 15:16.089
I want to get
the entire team together...

15:16.132 --> 15:19.135
I mean from promo to
strategyand I want to sit down

15:19.179 --> 15:21.398
and talk about
the big picture here.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.139
Okay.

15:23.183 --> 15:24.358
We"re done here.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.849
Trust.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.984
You always have to be
on top of me.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.986
Can you blame me?

15:44.030 --> 15:45.553
Teri?

15:45.596 --> 15:47.990
This is Dr. Seccia.
I had him flown in.

15:48.034 --> 15:50.079
I hear there"s
some discrepancies

15:50.123 --> 15:52.212
- over Andre"s chemo regimen...
- No, there"s...

15:52.255 --> 15:54.040
no discrepancies.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.172
Andre"s actually already
gotten a second, a third

15:56.216 --> 15:58.218
and a fourth opinion.

15:58.261 --> 16:00.437
None of which
his mother was present for.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.657
I"m here now. So...

16:02.700 --> 16:04.702
Well, I"ve, I've been here,

16:04.746 --> 16:07.705
and it was, and it still is,
his best option.

16:07.749 --> 16:11.666
Any deviation could jeopardizehis
space in Dr. Swain"s trial.

16:11.709 --> 16:15.409
Shh, shh, shh. I appreciate
your concern, sweetheart,

16:15.452 --> 16:16.888
but let"s hear the doctor out.

16:16.932 --> 16:18.020
He"s a specialist.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.413
At-at what?

16:19.456 --> 16:21.067
I-I"m just a nurse?

16:22.198 --> 16:24.157
Now, I-I-I"m sorry,

16:24.200 --> 16:28.117
because I"m the nurse that
Andretrusted his diagnosis with.

16:28.161 --> 16:30.293
Okay. But I"m gonna need you
to watch your tone, okay?

16:30.337 --> 16:32.295
- That"s my son.
- And that"s my man,

16:32.339 --> 16:33.862
whose side I"ve been at

16:33.905 --> 16:35.907
for the past month,
who I fed through a straw,

16:35.951 --> 16:38.084
- who came to me...
- That"s cute, girl.

16:38.127 --> 16:40.323
You fed him through a straw.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

16:40.347 --> 16:43.132
That doesn "t negate
everything I" ve done, - Ma...

16:43.176 --> 16:44.699
- okay?
- Ma. Ma.

16:44.742 --> 16:47.267
We already have
a treatment plan.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.181
But, baby, I...

16:48.224 --> 16:50.487
We"re good.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.153
I"m sorry.

17:04.196 --> 17:05.720
That"s quite all right.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.031
I"m fine.

17:17.732 --> 17:19.752
Push the sound check 15 minutes.
If he can"t make it,

17:19.777 --> 17:22.127
- then he gets not one today.
- Hey, yo, Blake"s saying.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.738
Treasure got fired.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.000
Is that real?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.132
What"d she do, bro?

17:26.175 --> 17:28.351
Giselle just said
"inappropriate behavior."

17:28.395 --> 17:30.397
I guess we can"t have fun.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.095
Fun?

17:33.139 --> 17:34.531
Yo, Keem, I swear, man,

17:34.575 --> 17:36.359
sometimes I don"t even
understand you.

17:36.403 --> 17:38.381
Our brother is literally hookedup
to a chemo drip, and you"re

17:38.405 --> 17:41.451
- talking about having fun.
- I"m just doing what he asked me to do.

17:41.495 --> 17:43.236
That"s keeping this tour going.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.281
- What, so you reached out to him?
- Nah.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.153
We ain"t close like you two.

17:49.416 --> 17:52.288
You know, when Andre was
in prison, he would...

17:52.332 --> 17:54.334
hit me up every single week,

17:54.377 --> 17:57.728
literally
just to check up on you.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.078
He loves you.

18:01.036 --> 18:03.952
Try showing him some love, too.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.129
Wait.

18:07.173 --> 18:10.001
What? More excuses? What?

18:10.045 --> 18:13.266
I got a better idea.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.964
So the good reviews hurt us?

18:16.007 --> 18:18.227
Is that even possible?

18:18.271 --> 18:20.621
Demand for free perks
and free tickets

18:20.664 --> 18:23.711
is really high...
Emphasis on "free," okay?

18:23.754 --> 18:25.713
Nobody is buying
the paid subscription

18:25.756 --> 18:27.715
to XStream, and no one
is buying music, either.

18:27.758 --> 18:30.413
Okay, then we need to do
more promotion

18:30.457 --> 18:32.937
about these paid options
at the tour sites.

18:32.981 --> 18:35.157
- No.
- I mean, what about auto-enrollment incentives?

18:35.201 --> 18:36.941
No, no, no, look, the last thing

18:36.985 --> 18:39.379
anybody wants when
they"re having a fun night out

18:39.422 --> 18:40.945
is to be reminded
of future bills.

18:40.989 --> 18:43.034
- They"re gonna hate us.
- Yeah, we"re gonna

18:43.078 --> 18:44.186
run through that hundred million

18:44.210 --> 18:45.448
faster than Patel"s
three months.

18:45.472 --> 18:47.256
Which we cannot afford
to do, so...

18:47.300 --> 18:51.260
What we cando is we can start
to canvas internationally,

18:51.304 --> 18:52.566
because the data mining thing

18:52.609 --> 18:54.611
wasn"t that big
of a scandal overseas.

18:54.655 --> 18:56.352
That"s what Andre suggested,

18:56.396 --> 18:58.441
and I think we should do it.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.106
Yeah, yeah,
keep it going, Philly!

19:11.150 --> 19:14.196
We got a lot going on tonight.
Let me hear you make some noise!

19:19.636 --> 19:20.831
Man, there"s some
label reps here.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.987
Bunkie heard one guy say
he came from New York City.

19:23.031 --> 19:25.338
- You gotta crush it, Lu.
- Yo, Cookie here yet?

19:25.381 --> 19:27.818
Nah. She"s at home
with little man.

19:27.862 --> 19:31.213
Vernon, I swear that kid"s got
some damn exorcist cough, man.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.693
And now coming to the stage,

19:32.736 --> 19:35.130
Philly"s own... y'all
can say y"all knew him when...

19:35.174 --> 19:38.307
Lucious... Lyon...!

19:41.484 --> 19:44.270
I like it, I like it, I like it!

19:46.707 --> 19:48.883
I"m sorry that our son

19:48.926 --> 19:51.233
is such an inconvenience
for you.

19:51.277 --> 19:54.236
Lucious... they waitin...

20:00.634 --> 20:02.679
Lucious, are you going to...

20:02.723 --> 20:05.465
participate in this meeting
you demanded?

20:05.508 --> 20:07.510
I need to be someplace.

20:09.643 --> 20:12.472
I understand how valuable

20:12.515 --> 20:13.951
your time is, Dr. Seccia.

20:13.995 --> 20:17.651
But look, everybody"s emotions
were just running high.

20:17.694 --> 20:21.089
I-I know I can still
make this worth your while.

20:21.132 --> 20:22.351
Please?

20:22.395 --> 20:24.484
Thank you.

20:28.314 --> 20:31.360
Well, look at what
the UPS delivered me.

20:31.404 --> 20:33.928
My own custom...

20:33.971 --> 20:35.495
"punchin" bag.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.758
Look, Cookie, if...
if that"s what you need,

20:37.801 --> 20:39.890
I completely understand.

20:41.718 --> 20:44.330
I didn"t come here
to ask you for anything.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.114
Listen, if I was
in your position,

20:46.157 --> 20:47.376
I would"ve dropped me, too.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.117
Except for I would have done it

20:49.160 --> 20:50.945
publicly, with a blowtorch.

20:50.988 --> 20:53.252
Trying to give me some ideas?

20:54.514 --> 20:56.342
Look...

20:56.385 --> 20:58.561
Cookie,
I wanted to come by today

20:58.605 --> 21:01.521
and let you know that it
was completely my fault.

21:01.564 --> 21:03.523
My... deadbeat manager
convinced me

21:03.566 --> 21:06.090
that my music wasn"t enough
to get the attention

21:06.134 --> 21:07.527
of the men that mattered.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.746
He said that
I had to convince them

21:09.790 --> 21:12.401
I was worth their timebefore
they could take a listen.

21:12.445 --> 21:14.185
Lucious was different.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.362
He just wanted to help me.

21:16.405 --> 21:18.277
You both did, and I ruined that.

21:19.974 --> 21:22.019
And I am so sorry.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.283
I"m sorry, Cookie.

21:26.459 --> 21:29.288
I"ll leave.

21:30.201 --> 21:31.464
Hold on.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.728
What you did was stupid...

21:34.771 --> 21:36.425
and painful.

21:36.469 --> 21:39.559
But most of all,
it was dangerous, girl.

21:39.602 --> 21:41.952
You know how many people
would be happy

21:41.996 --> 21:45.042
to take advantage of
a sweet little thing like you?

21:45.086 --> 21:46.479
And not to mention

21:46.522 --> 21:49.308
what Icould have done
to your little ass.

21:53.268 --> 21:54.748
I don"t want you
to leave Empire.

21:54.791 --> 21:58.491
W-Wait, you"re...
you"re not gonna drop me?

21:58.534 --> 21:59.840
You got some growing to do.

21:59.883 --> 22:02.712
And clearly, you"ve
been through some things,

22:02.756 --> 22:05.541
so we gonna get you
somebody to talk to.

22:05.585 --> 22:07.630
And then you"re gonna
get your little ass

22:07.674 --> 22:09.652
back in the studioand you
gonna make me some hits.

22:09.676 --> 22:12.505
Yes, ma"am. Thank you.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.855
Thank you so much. I...

22:14.898 --> 22:16.335
I promise, Cookie,

22:16.378 --> 22:19.163
whatever it takes to get
your trust back, I got you.

22:19.207 --> 22:20.600
Thank you. Thank you.

22:20.643 --> 22:21.557
- Thank you.
- All right, all right.

22:21.601 --> 22:23.080
- Go on over there.
- Okay.

22:23.124 --> 22:25.431
Thank you.

22:47.670 --> 22:50.499
What is going on in here?
What is she doing?

22:50.543 --> 22:52.545
- My job.
- I wouldn"t have to

22:52.588 --> 22:54.764
if you didn"t keep burning
grease into my pans.

22:56.897 --> 22:59.639
Cookie, what"s wrong?
Is this about Andre?

22:59.682 --> 23:00.857
Is he getting worse?

23:00.901 --> 23:03.251
Worse than stage IV cancer?

23:03.294 --> 23:04.470
Are you serious?

23:04.513 --> 23:06.341
No, this is not about Andre.

23:06.385 --> 23:09.605
Once again,
this is about Lucious.

23:09.649 --> 23:11.215
It"s about this morning?

23:11.259 --> 23:15.045
Cookie, what happened?
Honey, are you in trouble?

23:18.353 --> 23:21.443
I thought Lucious did
somethingso unforgivable,

23:21.487 --> 23:24.664
that I... I tried
to do the same.

23:24.707 --> 23:27.710
So what you do? Go get
yourselfanother man, baby?

23:32.759 --> 23:34.325
Cook.

23:34.369 --> 23:36.937
I don"t know
what I was thinking.

23:36.980 --> 23:40.331
 And the joke"s onme
because, for the first time,

23:40.375 --> 23:43.726
Lucious is innocent.

23:43.770 --> 23:45.293
I-I just wanted...

23:45.336 --> 23:48.601
I was so quick
to believe the worst,

23:48.644 --> 23:50.690
you know, Carol?

23:50.733 --> 23:53.562
I guess I wanted it to be true.

23:54.781 --> 23:56.173
I need to go tell him

23:56.217 --> 23:57.716
- and-and make him understand.
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

23:57.740 --> 24:01.527
Wait a second. Are you trying
to stay in this marriage?

24:01.570 --> 24:02.702
Of course.

24:02.745 --> 24:04.704
All right, honey, well,
you have to listen to me

24:04.747 --> 24:06.619
because someone like Lucious,

24:06.662 --> 24:08.577
he don"t understand
something like this.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.927
- I got to tell him.
- No. No, no, no.

24:10.971 --> 24:15.192
Cook, you cannot
tell him nothing.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.972
What happened
to your open mic night?

24:56.016 --> 24:57.974
I ditched it.

24:59.976 --> 25:01.151
How"s Dre doing?

25:02.805 --> 25:05.199
He"s not getting better.

25:05.242 --> 25:06.722
That"s 'cause
he"s got the croup.

25:06.766 --> 25:08.463
I called every clinic in town.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.770
They said we got
to get him outside.

25:10.813 --> 25:12.728
What?

25:17.951 --> 25:19.692
Pop?

25:19.735 --> 25:21.563
You came back.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.826
Damn right I came back.

25:23.870 --> 25:27.482
It"s not easy
seeing my boys sick,

25:27.526 --> 25:29.615
especially you.

25:29.658 --> 25:33.053
Yeah, I wouldn"t want to see
melike this either, Pop.

25:34.968 --> 25:37.579
Did I ever tell you

25:37.623 --> 25:41.409
about the first time that you
got really, really sick?

25:41.452 --> 25:43.803
Me and your mama, we had just

25:43.846 --> 25:45.848
started getting over, um,

25:45.892 --> 25:48.285
the loss of our first child,

25:48.329 --> 25:50.853
and you had this cough, but
we didn"t know what it was,

25:50.897 --> 25:54.596
so we"re calling over
to all these emergency rooms,

25:54.640 --> 25:57.991
and this one nurse, she got
on, she got on the phone

25:58.034 --> 26:00.036
and she said,
"What you need to do here,

26:00.080 --> 26:02.865
"you need to wrap the boy up,

26:02.909 --> 26:07.653
take him outside so that you
could breathe in the cold air."

26:07.696 --> 26:10.394
And, man, it was cold,
it was cold.

26:10.438 --> 26:13.310
So what"s the point of this?
For all of us to get sick?

26:13.354 --> 26:14.853
Did you have a different
suggestion that I didn"t hear?

26:14.877 --> 26:16.717
What, is cough syrup
not good enough for you?

26:16.749 --> 26:18.751
We"re out there
for, like, an hour.

26:18.794 --> 26:21.710
Your mama"s freezing.
She"s crying.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.494
Lucious, please.

26:25.584 --> 26:29.283
And I"m praying,
and looking down at you.

26:29.326 --> 26:30.850
It"s gonna be okay, buddy.

26:30.893 --> 26:32.721
I got you, okay?

26:32.765 --> 26:35.332
You looked up at me, and it was

26:35.376 --> 26:40.120
almost like you knew that
I needed you to get better.

26:40.163 --> 26:42.731
I still need you...

26:42.775 --> 26:44.733
to get better.

26:45.734 --> 26:48.128
Hear me?

26:49.695 --> 26:52.611
I don"t want
to be a burden, Pop.

26:54.264 --> 26:57.093
How could you ever be a burden
to me?

26:57.137 --> 26:59.574
You"re my son.

27:00.923 --> 27:03.099
I would kill...

27:03.143 --> 27:06.102
to defend you.

27:06.146 --> 27:10.367
And it"s not gonna be easy
seeing you sick,

27:10.411 --> 27:14.284
but I don"t care
how bad it gets.

27:14.328 --> 27:16.896
I will be your strength.

27:16.939 --> 27:19.333
There is nothing

27:19.376 --> 27:21.378
that you can say to me

27:21.422 --> 27:23.511
that I will not understand.

27:23.554 --> 27:26.122
There"s no darkness
I haven"t felt.

27:27.341 --> 27:29.778
There"s no sacrilege
I can"t handle.

27:31.911 --> 27:34.304
You understand me?

27:34.348 --> 27:35.915
Say it.

27:35.958 --> 27:38.569
I understand you, Pop.

27:39.440 --> 27:40.833
And you"ll beat this.

27:40.876 --> 27:43.009
Yes, sir.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.360
Yes, sir.

27:49.232 --> 27:51.104
There you go.

27:55.978 --> 27:58.111
Jamal, we got a couple
back-up generators on standby,

27:58.154 --> 27:59.895
but they won"t be here
for a couple hours.

27:59.939 --> 28:01.375
All right, so they get here,

28:01.418 --> 28:02.787
and we"ll be on our way
to the next city?

28:02.811 --> 28:04.770
That don"t make no sense.

28:06.815 --> 28:10.210
Turning over a new leaf,

28:10.253 --> 28:12.647
You know, I"m just,
picking up some new flavors

28:12.691 --> 28:14.780
in case
somebody wants another bite.

28:14.823 --> 28:16.869
Okay.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.087
- Clever.
- You should try it.

28:18.131 --> 28:22.004
Hey, yo, yo, Carli, um,
you know what a rider is?

28:22.048 --> 28:23.571
- Yeah.
- It means, like, the stuff

28:23.614 --> 28:26.313
that I requested, like this
right here, this-this ham...

28:26.356 --> 28:28.228
It"s what I wanted,
so if you want some,

28:28.271 --> 28:29.838
just put it on your own rider.

28:29.882 --> 28:31.187
So bill me, Blakey.

28:31.231 --> 28:33.537
Bill you? 20%. How about that?

28:33.581 --> 28:35.583
- Here we go.
- Can you believe this?

28:35.626 --> 28:36.995
I mean, he"s not even
gonna try to be chill

28:37.019 --> 28:38.325
about Tiana in front of me?

28:38.368 --> 28:40.370
- Yeah, yeah. Jamal?
- Give me one second, okay?

28:40.414 --> 28:42.895
- Can I have Treasure"s slot?
- What?

28:42.938 --> 28:45.332
Hey, Jamal, listen, they can
have some gas generators here.

28:45.375 --> 28:46.788
Hey, where were you
the other night with the...?

28:46.812 --> 28:47.963
But how much do you care
about the fire code?

28:47.987 --> 28:49.205
- Jamal?
- Jamal?

28:49.249 --> 28:50.990
Do you want
to call her your bitch?!

28:52.382 --> 28:54.012
Yo. Yo, Blakey,
why are you hollering at me?

28:54.036 --> 28:56.778
I"m not thirsty! I'm good.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.998
What are you gonna do about it?

28:59.041 --> 29:00.671
Get out of my way!-What
are you gonna do about it?

29:00.695 --> 29:03.045
Aah! What the hell?!

29:03.089 --> 29:05.569
Everybody shut the hell up!

29:05.613 --> 29:09.008
Second damn night.
This is what we about?

29:09.051 --> 29:10.400
Y"all need to take your fighting

29:10.444 --> 29:12.054
and your stupidity
and put it aside.

29:12.098 --> 29:15.144
"Cause the Trust Tour is about
more than that. It has to be.

29:15.188 --> 29:17.494
Anyone of y"all
that ain"t down with that,

29:17.538 --> 29:20.236
please take your asses
and roll on!

29:20.280 --> 29:23.674
Our fans, yourfans...
They got stuff

29:23.718 --> 29:26.001
going on in their lives thatwe
ain"t never gonna know about.

29:26.025 --> 29:28.505
But they got their asses
up out of bed this morning,

29:28.549 --> 29:31.073
and they"re comingto see
us tonight, so every time

29:31.117 --> 29:33.815
that you go out on that stage...
Every single time...

29:33.859 --> 29:38.820
You be their hopes, you be
theirdreams, you be their escape.

29:38.864 --> 29:41.605
Now... can you handle that?

29:41.649 --> 29:44.217
I said, can you handle that?

29:44.260 --> 29:46.741
- Yes!
- Come on, team.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.091
Every single crew member,
come on, bring it in.

29:49.135 --> 29:52.442
All hands on deck, on three.

29:54.923 --> 29:57.230
For Andre.

29:57.273 --> 29:58.971
One,

29:59.014 --> 30:01.103
- two, three.
- Trust!

30:11.070 --> 30:13.550
Cookie, I was surprised
you wanted to see me.

30:13.594 --> 30:15.857
You know,
you went dark after you left.

30:15.901 --> 30:19.992
Um, did anyone see you
come in here?

30:20.035 --> 30:23.082
Just security, but legal
has me here to sign paperwork

30:23.125 --> 30:26.912
for the community center,
so, we"re covered.

30:26.955 --> 30:29.131
It has to stay that way, okay?

30:29.175 --> 30:31.133
Look, Damon,

30:31.177 --> 30:33.135
what happened,

30:33.179 --> 30:35.572
you can"t tell anybody.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.560
- Yeah.
- Okay.

31:16.831 --> 31:18.398
Wait. Wait.

31:18.441 --> 31:20.835
- You want to take it slow?
- No, no, no. This ain"t right.

31:20.879 --> 31:21.943
- What?
- This is not right.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.620
- I can"t do this.
- Hey.

31:25.796 --> 31:27.189
You"re sure?

31:27.233 --> 31:28.625
- Hey.
- This isn"t right.

31:28.669 --> 31:32.064
This isn "t right. I" m sorry.

31:32.847 --> 31:35.197
You think that little of me?

31:35.241 --> 31:37.156
Of course
what happened was just for us.

31:37.199 --> 31:38.940
Okay, look.

31:38.984 --> 31:41.551
There is no "us," okay?
So stop saying that.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.747
You wanted me, Cookie. Come on, man.
Ain"t no shame in that.

31:43.771 --> 31:45.451
Look, look, look,
none of that matters now.

31:50.430 --> 31:52.954
My son Andre...

31:52.998 --> 31:56.523
has stage IV lymphoma.

31:56.566 --> 31:59.004
I"m sorry.
I"m sorry to hear that.

31:59.047 --> 32:01.354
I know that pain.

32:01.397 --> 32:04.792
I feel like...
it"s my fault, you know?

32:04.835 --> 32:07.186
I feel like...

32:07.229 --> 32:11.668
I was disloyal
to my family and...

32:11.712 --> 32:14.019
and now my son has to pay.

32:14.062 --> 32:16.021
Let me stop you right there.

32:16.064 --> 32:18.023
You"re not that important.

32:18.066 --> 32:19.938
Excuse me?

32:22.636 --> 32:25.595
When my daughter was diagnosed
with cancer,

32:25.639 --> 32:28.076
I thought the same thing.

32:34.517 --> 32:37.129
I"ve done some bad things,
Cookie.

32:37.172 --> 32:40.088
My reckoning is inevitable.

32:40.132 --> 32:43.048
But the idea that my daughter
would have to pay the price...

32:43.091 --> 32:47.226
Man, that was unbearable.

32:49.141 --> 32:51.491
What do you do to stop...

32:51.534 --> 32:53.841
feeling like this?

32:53.884 --> 32:56.148
Watching her fight,

32:56.191 --> 32:59.586
it made me realize
exactly how small Iwas.

32:59.629 --> 33:02.806
And I didn"t have the power
to control her illness.

33:02.850 --> 33:04.852
And neither do you.

33:04.895 --> 33:06.288
You hear me

33:06.332 --> 33:08.464
when I tell you this, okay?

33:08.508 --> 33:13.513
You are not important enough
to cause any of this.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.735
What do I do?

33:18.779 --> 33:21.434
You be there for your son.
Whatever he needs.

33:23.871 --> 33:26.265
Okay.

33:26.308 --> 33:28.136
Thank you.

33:30.356 --> 33:32.619
I"m here for you
if ever you need to talk.

33:32.662 --> 33:35.187
Okay.

33:39.147 --> 33:41.497
And...

33:41.541 --> 33:45.371
you don"t have to worry
about anything else from me.

34:05.478 --> 34:08.219
We"re-we're fine, y"all.
It"s cool. Thank you.

34:13.529 --> 34:15.226
Y"all, I just need
to get centered.

34:15.270 --> 34:16.967
I think you"ve made
enough demands.

34:17.011 --> 34:18.317
Look, you can"t make any more

34:18.360 --> 34:20.710
unilateral decisions
about our relationship.

34:20.754 --> 34:22.277
- Relationship?
- Yes.

34:22.321 --> 34:25.541
- We"re back together.
- Jamal, you"re on in two.

34:25.585 --> 34:27.021
Just, wait...

34:27.065 --> 34:28.370
Yeah. Please?

34:28.414 --> 34:30.981
Look, I don"t know
where my life is gonna be

34:31.025 --> 34:32.244
in the next couple months,

34:32.286 --> 34:33.984
and I don"t even have control
over that.

34:34.027 --> 34:36.378
Which is exactly why you need
someone who"s rational

34:36.422 --> 34:39.251
to keep you from making
crazy, rash decisions.

34:39.293 --> 34:40.947
They"re not im...

34:40.991 --> 34:44.255
Look, I-I love you andl
appreciate what you"re doing,

34:44.299 --> 34:45.996
but it"s just...

34:46.040 --> 34:47.302
How would this even work?

34:47.346 --> 34:50.043
Look, we"re gonna figure thiswhole
thing out together, Jamal.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.327
All right? And i-it"s gonna be
challenging and-and dramatic

34:52.351 --> 34:54.416
and, yeah, we"re probably
gonnahave a bunch of fights.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.224
Then why would we do it?

34:56.268 --> 34:58.008
Because, as soon
as I saw you again, I knew.

34:58.052 --> 35:01.273
I"d rather have your mess
than someone else"s easy.

35:06.365 --> 35:07.540
I got to...

35:10.325 --> 35:13.067
You"re my home, Jamal.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.678
Now, put this back on.

35:25.645 --> 35:29.779
Philadelphia, are you ready

35:29.823 --> 35:31.781
for Hakeem and Jamal Lyon?

35:37.396 --> 35:40.399
We love you!

35:40.442 --> 35:41.661
We love you so much.

35:41.704 --> 35:43.402
Um, you know,

35:43.445 --> 35:47.101
there"s not just two
Lyon brothers.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.755
We have a big brother,

35:48.798 --> 35:51.105
and his name is Andre Lyon.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.411
There would be no Trust Tour

35:52.454 --> 35:55.588
and there would be no Empire
without our brother.

35:55.631 --> 35:58.765
So, Philadelphia,
this is our home.

35:58.808 --> 36:00.419
Please.

36:00.462 --> 36:03.639
Please help us out
to let our brother know

36:03.683 --> 36:07.252
just how very, very,
very loved he is.

36:07.295 --> 36:10.603
Here we are.

39:08.215 --> 39:11.218
Miss Cookie?
Dr. Seccia"s on the line.

39:11.261 --> 39:13.438
Would you like for me
to conference him in

39:13.481 --> 39:16.397
when Dr. Swain arrives
with the test results?

39:16.441 --> 39:19.444
That-that won"t be
necessary, Juanita.

39:19.487 --> 39:24.231
Andre has everything
and everybody he needs.

39:37.549 --> 39:39.551
I hear a train.

39:43.685 --> 39:46.122
You hear a train, baby?
You hear a train?

39:46.166 --> 39:48.211
My God.

39:48.255 --> 39:49.430
That"s my boy.

39:52.477 --> 39:55.001
Thank you.

39:55.044 --> 39:57.264
For what?

39:57.307 --> 39:59.397
I never thought
I"d have all this.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.444
I"ll never let this go.

40:17.719 --> 40:20.461
Hey.

40:20.505 --> 40:22.724
Baby.

40:22.768 --> 40:27.512
I really don"t give a damn
whatthat doctor has to say.

40:27.555 --> 40:31.472
I"m not giving up on our boy.

40:31.516 --> 40:34.301
And I"m not gonna give up on us, either.

40:34.344 --> 40:35.911
Do you understand me?

40:35.955 --> 40:37.478
I know.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.088
I believe you.

40:39.132 --> 40:42.222
I"m so sorry, Lucious.

40:46.008 --> 40:47.749
Dr. Swain.

40:47.793 --> 40:49.664
Dr. Swain.

40:49.708 --> 40:52.319
Thank you so much for coming.

40:52.362 --> 40:54.713
Mr. Lyon, Mrs. Lyon.

40:54.756 --> 40:56.236
Andre.

40:58.325 --> 41:00.283
How are you feeling?

41:00.327 --> 41:02.851
Well, my nausea"s held steady,

41:02.895 --> 41:04.636
but the fatigue is slightly
abating.

41:04.679 --> 41:06.768
- The hair and nail loss is consistent...
- Andre.

41:06.812 --> 41:08.640
Just be honest.

41:10.337 --> 41:11.991
I feel terrible, Doc.

41:13.949 --> 41:14.907
That"s great news.

41:14.950 --> 41:17.736
That means the chemo is working.

41:21.130 --> 41:24.090
Your full blood count
came back robust.

41:24.133 --> 41:26.493
You"ve qualified to move onto
the next phase of the trial.

41:27.615 --> 41:30.096
- Do you mean it?
- Yeah.

41:30.139 --> 41:32.664
Yes. They mean it.

41:32.707 --> 41:34.230
Thank you.

41:34.274 --> 41:37.320
Yes..

41:51.683 --> 41:52.683
Lucious?

41:54.033 --> 41:55.251
Can we talk?

41:55.295 --> 41:58.080
Baby, we can do anything
you want to do.

42:02.781 --> 42:07.394
Well, you know that night,
with you and Treasure.

42:07.437 --> 42:09.048
Well, you know
what I was thinking.

42:09.091 --> 42:11.616
Yeah, but that"s all
in the past now.

42:11.659 --> 42:16.882
And Andre"s getting better,
and... we"re good.

42:19.885 --> 42:22.757
I got something
I need to tell you.

42:24.106 --> 42:26.456
What, baby?

42:26.500 --> 42:28.415
What?

42:34.552 --> 42:36.075
I love you.

42:38.251 --> 42:39.905
I love you, too, baby.

42:43.299 --> 42:46.476
I love you so much.

43:02.710 --> 43:06.714
You were a very difficult one
to track down.

43:06.758 --> 43:09.543
I cannot wait to see

43:09.587 --> 43:13.068
how you"re gonna
make it up to me.

43:13.112 --> 43:15.462
Why would I help you?

43:15.505 --> 43:19.118
Associating with the FBI
destroyed my career.

43:19.161 --> 43:20.989
Because I"m the best shot
you"ve got

43:21.033 --> 43:22.861
in taking down your father,
Lucious Lyon.

43:22.904 --> 43:26.473
That is what you want, isn"t it?

44:23.878 --> 44:26.925
Profits over patients, again.-You
save your morality lesson.

44:26.968 --> 44:28.404
You have to save him!

44:28.448 --> 44:30.537
Be careful.

44:30.580 --> 44:32.582
- You tried to kill him.
- I had no choice!
