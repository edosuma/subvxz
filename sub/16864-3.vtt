WEBVTT

00:01.242 --> 00:03.620
Previously on "Rescue Me"...
How you doing? Hurry up and

00:03.687 --> 00:06.683
get back in the saddle, 'cause
we may not be here that long.

00:06.751 --> 00:08.115
The Mayor's closing down houses.

00:08.183 --> 00:11.947
We got a big target on our back.
So do the West Side Wildmen,

00:11.988 --> 00:14.242
and only one of us
is going to be shut down.

00:14.307 --> 00:16.705
Franco, he was a godsend.

00:16.773 --> 00:20.466
He fixed the car. He fixed the stove.
Did you know that he cooks?

00:20.534 --> 00:23.297
Did you go by my house a couple
of times while I was laid up?

00:23.365 --> 00:25.197
A couple of times, yeah.
I was there almost every day.

00:25.265 --> 00:28.095
If something happens to me
again, don't go by the house.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.292
I want Damian out.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.126
Out of what?

00:30.194 --> 00:32.025
The job, the calling.

00:32.093 --> 00:33.456
There's a kid trapped down there.

00:33.524 --> 00:34.355
All right. I'm going.

00:34.423 --> 00:35.720
No, no, no. Don't go.
I don't think he should go.

00:35.840 --> 00:37.787
He's the only one of us got a
chance of squeezing through.

00:37.855 --> 00:39.121
All right.

00:39.188 --> 00:40.285
Good job, Dam.

00:40.353 --> 00:42.733
This is the best goddamn job ever.

00:42.853 --> 00:43.450
Yes.

00:43.518 --> 00:44.497
Do you want to go to a meeting?

00:44.617 --> 00:47.182
I'm living in the moment.
I'm making some positive changes.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.677
I think you're drinking too much.

00:48.941 --> 00:50.281
This is what my old man did to me.

00:50.323 --> 00:53.859
Made me drink and smoke until, you
know, I felt like quitting.

00:53.979 --> 00:55.410
Shawn! No!

00:55.477 --> 00:57.642
I was going to change.
Today was the day, and you know,

00:57.710 --> 01:00.009
the world is not cooperating.

01:00.077 --> 01:02.241
So, shoot me.

01:12.108 --> 01:12.873
Hey.

01:12.941 --> 01:15.506
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?

01:15.574 --> 01:20.005
Well, Colleen and I have come to a decision.
No more booze,

01:20.072 --> 01:20.988
no more butts.

01:21.466 --> 01:24.624
Yeah. I think that night that we spent
down at the bar may have been

01:24.897 --> 01:26.150
very interesting for her.

01:26.270 --> 01:28.184
May have learned
something about herself.

01:28.937 --> 01:30.149
Her legs are hollow?

01:31.105 --> 01:34.104
Honey, I'm serious. I think... I don't know.
I think she,

01:34.171 --> 01:39.270
you know, may have gotten scared about
her, you know, capacity for it.

01:40.505 --> 01:41.237
Hmm?

01:41.304 --> 01:44.172
Well, I am very impressed, Tommy.

01:44.418 --> 01:47.804
And I'm not buying a word of it.
Very impressed.

01:47.872 --> 01:52.238
Honey, baby steps, but steps nonetheless.
I swear to God.

01:52.305 --> 01:53.938
All right.

01:54.006 --> 01:58.739
Serious. You know?
Finally, some information maybe,

01:58.807 --> 02:04.774
you know... what... whoa.
A little early for that, isn't it?

02:04.842 --> 02:05.574
What?

02:05.642 --> 02:07.508
Wine.
It's 8:00 in the morning.

02:07.575 --> 02:09.607
What, you're not tossing these?

02:09.675 --> 02:12.274
No. I'm tossing
booze, not wine.

02:12.342 --> 02:19.508
- Wine is booze.
- Honey, no. Booze is booze.

02:19.576 --> 02:23.076
Oh. Ok. Now, is is going to
sound really silly, but

02:23.196 --> 02:26.744
define booze for me, OK?
The difference between wine and booze.

02:26.812 --> 02:30.978
Ok. Honey, booze is booze.
Booze is, you know, whiskey

02:31.046 --> 02:33.546
and vodka and, you know, spirits.

02:33.613 --> 02:35.513
- You know?
- And wine?

02:35.581 --> 02:39.581
Wine is in a whole separate family, honey.
Wine is like

02:39.649 --> 02:44.206
you know... it's a delicacy.
Wine is like, uh, it's grape juice

02:44.232 --> 02:46.593
with a little extra kick.
It's when... you know,

02:46.713 --> 02:49.121
they talk about fine wines, you know?

02:49.241 --> 02:52.699
It's like France. They drink wine
in France all day.

02:52.732 --> 02:54.436
I mean, they don't drink at 8:00
in the morning, but

02:54.485 --> 02:56.153
They start around lunchtime, you know.

02:56.220 --> 02:57.253
They take it pretty serious.

02:57.321 --> 03:01.023
And which explains why France
is the superpower it is today.

03:01.090 --> 03:04.525
Ok. Yeah. Italy... I mean, I could
name a million countries.

03:04.593 --> 03:06.461
Ok. Do you see how
desperate you are?

03:06.895 --> 03:08.870
- I'm not desperate. I'm...
- Hey, you're trying to use Italy...

03:08.920 --> 03:09.844
to win an argument.

03:09.964 --> 03:12.020
- Honey...
- Ok? Forget the French. Forget the Italians.

03:12.140 --> 03:14.620
You are 100% Mick
through and through,

03:14.948 --> 03:16.725
and that little kick that wine has,

03:17.039 --> 03:19.674
you're going to keep drinking it
until it kicks you like a goddamn mule.

03:19.742 --> 03:23.545
Oh. Ok. I... I know what this is.
I know.

03:23.613 --> 03:27.550
I know what you're doing. Yeah.
This is... you know what this? It's racist.

03:27.618 --> 03:29.166
- That's what this is. This is...
- Oh, come on.

03:29.286 --> 03:32.369
No, it's the stereotypical,
you know, Irish cliche.

03:32.489 --> 03:34.056
All we're good for is drinking, right?

03:34.124 --> 03:35.156
And fighting.

03:35.224 --> 03:36.791
Racism.

03:36.858 --> 03:38.226
And making bad food.

03:38.639 --> 03:39.708
Racism.

03:39.828 --> 03:42.430
Hey, Tommy, it's in your blood.
It's in her blood.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.760
You... you have any idea

03:45.880 --> 03:49.000
how much wine it would take for me and

03:49.287 --> 03:53.106
and Colleen to get even
remotely shit-faced, OK?

03:53.226 --> 03:55.372
No. I have absolutely no idea,

03:55.492 --> 03:58.411
but I'm certain the two of you
will find out very, very soon.

03:58.478 --> 04:01.147
Hey. This can work.

04:01.215 --> 04:03.615
Ugh. For the two of you, I doubt it.

04:03.735 --> 04:06.362
For the entire Napa Valley?
It's a goddamn gold rush

04:06.649 --> 04:09.122
and do me a favor and keep count.

04:09.190 --> 04:10.597
We will.

04:14.055 --> 04:18.130
So, uh, what's better with
cheerios, white or red?

04:18.666 --> 04:19.994
Funny.

â™ª on another day, c'mon, c'mon,
with these ropes I tied,

04:31.446 --> 04:36.484
can we do no wrong, now we
grieve 'cause now is gone

04:36.551 --> 04:41.222
things were good when we were young,
with my teeth locked down,

04:41.290 --> 04:46.094
I can see the blood of a thousand
men who have come and gone,

04:46.161 --> 04:50.965
now we grieve 'cause now
is gone, things were good

04:51.033 --> 04:54.102
when we were young, is it safe to say?

04:54.170 --> 04:57.273
C'mon, c'mon, was it right to leave?

04:57.340 --> 05:00.810
C'mon, c'mon, will I ever learn?

Hey, what's going on?

05:19.908 --> 05:21.406
Yo! What's crackin', my man?

05:21.526 --> 05:23.808
- Hey, listen. I'm on my way in, and...
- Oh, that's right.

05:23.928 --> 05:27.683
First day back to school for you.
You excited? You get a new lunch box?

05:27.750 --> 05:29.017
Yeah. That's really funny.

05:29.085 --> 05:32.100
Listen, the guys, are they
planning, like, some kind of bullshit,

05:32.220 --> 05:34.176
you know, celebratory
surprise thing for me?

05:34.204 --> 05:35.603
And I know you're probably
surrounded by the guys,

05:35.723 --> 05:38.725
- so just give me a yes or no answer on it.
- No.

05:38.792 --> 05:42.395
Ok, which means yes.
Tell the guys take the banner and

05:42.463 --> 05:43.997
the bundt thing down,

05:44.064 --> 05:45.332
you know. They can start eating the cake.

05:45.399 --> 05:48.137
Send the strippers home. I don't want
to make a big thing out of this.

05:48.257 --> 05:52.051
Actually, tell them... tell them they can
keep the strippers around, but

05:52.052 --> 05:55.373
otherwise you know,
business as usual, OK?

05:55.441 --> 05:58.508
I don't know, dude.
The guys are pretty excited.

05:58.576 --> 05:59.976
Well, I don't want to be
a dick about it, but...

06:00.044 --> 06:01.411
Well, old habits die hard.

06:01.478 --> 06:02.559
- What?
- Nothing.

06:02.980 --> 06:05.884
Ok. You broke up on me there for a second.
Listen, it's just...

06:06.004 --> 06:07.382
Tell them it's a regular day.

06:07.449 --> 06:09.883
All right.
I'll break the bad news to the guys.

06:09.951 --> 06:11.450
All right.
Talk to you when I get there.

06:16.756 --> 06:17.757
Who was that, probie?

06:17.824 --> 06:18.992
Nobody special.

06:19.060 --> 06:20.861
- Yes, dudes! Got one.
- Finally.

06:20.929 --> 06:23.846
Yeah, congratulations, asshole.
Only took you 3 1/2 hours.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.401
It would help if it actually
fit in the jigsaw puzzle,

06:26.469 --> 06:28.837
- you douche. You can't just squeeze it in.
- What's wrong with you?

06:42.886 --> 06:45.688
Hey. What's going on?

06:45.756 --> 06:46.690
Nothing much, man.

06:46.757 --> 06:48.292
Where is everybody?

06:48.360 --> 06:49.427
I don't know.

06:49.495 --> 06:51.681
Ok.

07:12.890 --> 07:14.026
That was like a queef.

07:14.146 --> 07:14.904
Hey.

07:15.024 --> 07:16.726
Hey, what's up, T?

07:16.794 --> 07:17.957
Hey, what's up? Come on, do it.

07:18.014 --> 07:19.505
What the hell are you doing in?

07:19.963 --> 07:23.198
This is the day you told me
I could come back to work, right?

07:23.266 --> 07:24.534
Was that today?

07:24.602 --> 07:27.069
Marlon Brando you're not, OK?

07:27.136 --> 07:29.040
- Nice try.
- Ok.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.405
Guys. Ahem. Hey.

07:31.473 --> 07:33.986
- Go ahead...
- So, where are they?

07:34.106 --> 07:35.342
- Who?
- What are you talking about?

07:35.410 --> 07:36.344
Really?

07:37.078 --> 07:38.645
Strippers. Where are they?
In the other room?

07:38.713 --> 07:39.494
Yeah, they're in the other room.

07:39.511 --> 07:41.948
Lou, will you give us a
little bit of a template for the...

07:42.016 --> 07:43.383
the proper...

07:43.451 --> 07:44.117
Oh!

07:46.622 --> 07:47.822
That's an opening act.

07:50.759 --> 07:51.859
He's checking the back room.

07:53.228 --> 07:54.662
All right.
Go, go, go.

07:57.165 --> 07:59.367
- Ow! Aw.
- You all right?

07:59.434 --> 08:01.493
- All right.
- Hey, guys.

08:03.887 --> 08:06.740
Ok. I get it. Where are they?
In the bunk room?

08:06.808 --> 08:08.963
The truck?
You got 'em in the truck?

08:09.083 --> 08:10.467
The hell are you talking about?

08:10.945 --> 08:13.652
Hey, the jig is up, assholes. All right?

08:13.885 --> 08:16.518
Before they get cold or tired
and leave.

08:16.546 --> 08:18.182
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
didn't you tell me

08:18.250 --> 08:20.416
that you didn't want us making a big
deal out of you coming back?

08:20.484 --> 08:24.019
Let me get this straight.
I snuck out of the hospital, and

08:24.086 --> 08:28.353
I did my own rehab to get myself
back into this room and ready to

08:28.420 --> 08:31.088
go back to work with you guys,
and you have... what?

08:31.156 --> 08:38.244
You're telling me there's no cake, no,
uh... no girls, no hats, nothing?

08:38.364 --> 08:39.028
Yes.

08:40.592 --> 08:43.432
Lou is the winner! Come on.
Pay up, pay up.

08:43.499 --> 08:46.650
You guys aren't going to even
lift a finger to welcome me back.

08:48.476 --> 08:49.943
Ok.

08:50.010 --> 08:51.478
- We missed you.
- Tommy's back.

08:52.213 --> 08:53.748
I'm laughing so hard.

08:57.125 --> 09:00.077
Consider yourself fortunate
it wasn't a different finger.

09:00.821 --> 09:03.549
Yeah. I got a finger for you.

09:07.365 --> 09:08.909
Step on it, Niels.

09:09.029 --> 09:13.168
This call box is smack dead between us
and the West Side Wildmen.

09:13.235 --> 09:17.571
Whoever gets first on the scene scores
big points with HQ and and the natives.

09:17.639 --> 09:19.110
Hold onto your nuts.

09:19.474 --> 09:24.419
Well, normally I prefer a warm bath and
a glass of red wine, but I'll makedo.

09:34.777 --> 09:38.229
Well, well, well.
If it isn't girls gone wild.

09:38.349 --> 09:40.898
Homos on wheels. Holy shit.

09:40.966 --> 09:42.066
Is that Tommy Gavin?

09:42.134 --> 09:44.502
- That's right.
- Back to work already.

09:44.569 --> 09:46.971
Hardly recognize you without the
bull's-eye on your forehead.

09:47.039 --> 09:48.850
I'm rubber, you're glue, pal.

09:50.777 --> 09:52.608
Nice comeback, huh? I'm bleeding.

09:53.079 --> 09:55.915
So, how's it feel to play second fiddle
to the best house in Harlem?

09:55.983 --> 09:58.118
Second fiddle my ass.
We were here first.

09:58.185 --> 09:59.452
I don't think so, pendejo.

10:01.589 --> 10:05.657
Hey, hey. Knock it off.
This ain't "West Side Story."

10:06.792 --> 10:08.897
So what, Kurt Cobain pulled the box?

10:09.017 --> 10:11.816
All right. Here's what's going to happen.
We're all going to do our jobs

10:11.862 --> 10:13.314
and see how this plays out.

10:14.171 --> 10:15.842
The old heroin hang, huh?

10:17.342 --> 10:20.444
- You cop a rotten bag? Phew!
- Grab the medical bag.

10:20.512 --> 10:21.746
He might be in OD.

10:21.813 --> 10:23.380
We were here first.
This is our call.

10:23.448 --> 10:25.315
Arrived first, my dimpled ass.

10:25.383 --> 10:28.138
Black Shawn, go get the med kit.
Tommy, phone in the bus, will you?

10:28.258 --> 10:29.567
- Got it.
- This is our call.

10:29.687 --> 10:30.487
Hey, it's our call.

10:30.554 --> 10:31.321
Who asked you?

10:31.388 --> 10:32.422
Who asked you, asshole?

10:32.489 --> 10:34.042
Who you calling
asshole, asshole?

10:34.425 --> 10:36.271
I'm calling you an asshole.
And you an asshole. You're all

10:36.293 --> 10:37.334
You're all assholes, as a matter of fact.

10:37.454 --> 10:38.792
- Except you, of course.
- God.

10:38.827 --> 10:40.074
You're amazing.
What's your name?

10:40.109 --> 10:42.013
- Eat shit, asshole.
- Ok. Feisty. I like it.

10:42.069 --> 10:43.568
Look, why don't you guys
just back off, huh, Bob?

10:43.600 --> 10:45.804
- You back off. He's ours.
- No, he's ours.

10:46.736 --> 10:47.603
Hey!

10:47.671 --> 10:49.104
Whoa, you're right.
He's yours.

10:49.172 --> 10:50.854
Oh, no. Bullshit.
You got here first.

10:50.974 --> 10:53.476
- You want it. You called it. You got it.
- Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

10:53.544 --> 10:54.877
- Yes, it does matter.
- No, it does not, either.

10:54.911 --> 10:55.821
What is this, third grade?

10:55.941 --> 10:58.547
Penny, get the O2 kit and
some ice packs off the rig.

10:58.615 --> 11:00.234
Damian, open his pants.

11:00.354 --> 11:01.784
Wait, you want me to blow him back to life?

11:01.852 --> 11:03.652
- Yeah.
- Just open his pants, probie.

11:03.720 --> 11:05.432
All right. Get in there.

11:07.457 --> 11:10.927
Now, take one of those ice packs
and shove it under his nut sack.

11:11.461 --> 11:14.522
What? This ain't how I get my
kicks, sweetheart. Just do it.

11:14.999 --> 11:15.898
Here, I'll do it.

11:15.966 --> 11:16.966
No, I'll do it.

11:17.034 --> 11:18.768
You know, I'm pretty
sure he shit his pants.

11:19.098 --> 11:20.260
Yeah. You do it.

11:25.009 --> 11:26.411
- Attaboy.
- Oh.

11:26.479 --> 11:27.857
- Yeah. Yeah.
- There you go.

11:27.977 --> 11:30.350
See?
And they say chivalry's dead.

11:30.417 --> 11:33.353
You want me to grab a saws-all
so you can cut that hand off later?

11:33.420 --> 11:35.321
Yeah.
Bus is on its way, lieutenant.

11:35.389 --> 11:38.058
- Good. - All right.
Put another bag under his nuts, OK?

11:38.126 --> 11:39.505
Go on. Get back in there.

11:39.625 --> 11:40.761
I better get a phone
number out of this.

11:40.828 --> 11:43.063
His or mine?

11:43.130 --> 11:44.697
- Ooh!
- Oh! Ugh!

11:44.765 --> 11:46.966
Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

11:47.034 --> 11:47.967
Get your hand out!

11:48.035 --> 11:49.502
I can't! It's stuck!

11:49.570 --> 11:51.771
Rape! Rape!

11:51.839 --> 11:52.906
Jesus Christ!

11:52.973 --> 11:54.140
Ok? What the hell is this?

11:54.208 --> 11:56.677
You ODed, and we saved your
life, that's what this is.

11:56.744 --> 11:58.779
You wrecked my high
is what you did, man.

11:58.847 --> 12:01.621
Ok. He's going to live to shoot
up another day.

12:01.741 --> 12:05.183
Gentlemen, this is a draw. Everyone,
please return to neutral corners.

12:05.212 --> 12:06.587
Yeah.
We'll settle this at cook-off.

12:06.655 --> 12:09.124
- Yeah, right.
- You assholes don't stand a chance.

12:09.191 --> 12:10.725
Yeah, whatever.

12:10.793 --> 12:12.796
Whatever?

12:17.202 --> 12:18.303
You look at these dickheads?

12:18.371 --> 12:19.271
Idiots, dude.

12:19.338 --> 12:20.639
Morons.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.141
Like looking in a mirror, huh?

12:22.209 --> 12:23.490
You know what? No one's talking
to you, black Shawn.

12:23.521 --> 12:24.293
Why don't you keep walking?

12:24.320 --> 12:26.201
Yeah, dude. Why don't you
go dribble a basketball or something?

12:26.215 --> 12:29.441
Ha. It's the only reason he was brought
into our house in the first place, right?

12:29.561 --> 12:31.637
Look at me now, running circles
around you clowns.

12:31.757 --> 12:33.358
But don't get sensitive, ladies.

12:33.426 --> 12:37.364
Every village has an idiot.
We're just blessed to have dos...

12:37.431 --> 12:38.932
You, you.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.975
You know what?
I'm so sick of that shit, man.

12:42.010 --> 12:44.464
I went to college, briefly. That's right.
I got some college in me.

12:44.508 --> 12:46.039
Yeah, man.
I got a bachelor's degree.

12:46.106 --> 12:47.959
- Do you really?
- Yeah, I got it online

12:48.020 --> 12:50.888
but, you know, it still counts, right?
Not to mention I am a bachelor, dude.

12:51.008 --> 12:52.104
Yeah. You know what? It does count.

12:52.224 --> 12:54.180
Between the two of us, we practically
got, like, a master's degree.

12:54.248 --> 12:58.218
Yeah. You know what? We're a lot smarter than
people are giving us credit for around here.

12:58.285 --> 13:00.042
Yeah. You're right. You know what?
We're going to do something about it.

13:00.043 --> 13:01.253
You and me, we're going to team up, and

13:01.321 --> 13:03.726
we're going to prove to these assholes
that we're not just, like, punching bags.

13:03.755 --> 13:07.827
- Yeah. How?
- I don't know. Let me think.

13:08.661 --> 13:11.462
- Uh...
- Cramp?

13:11.530 --> 13:13.499
Huh? Oh, I got an idea.

13:14.032 --> 13:15.011
New Orleans.

13:15.131 --> 13:17.502
Dude. Mardi Gras, bro.
I like it.

13:17.569 --> 13:18.936
Hello.
It's not for the greater good.

13:19.004 --> 13:21.257
Dude, a couple of days down
in Mardi Gras would be great,

13:21.377 --> 13:23.474
bro, and it sure would do me a
shitload of good, you know?

13:23.542 --> 13:25.877
- I'm talking about, like, helping people.
- Like who?

13:25.944 --> 13:29.994
Like, uh, the victims of hurricane
what's-her-face, Katrina?

13:30.114 --> 13:31.414
Dude, that was, like, 10 years ago.

13:31.482 --> 13:32.794
Bro, it was 3 years ago, OK?

13:32.836 --> 13:34.549
A lot of those people don't
even have places to live. So.

13:34.617 --> 13:36.876
Well, I saw on TV, actually,
where Brad Pitt's building

13:36.904 --> 13:38.483
a bunch of houses for
the people down there.

13:38.539 --> 13:39.379
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:39.424 --> 13:40.352
Brad Pitt's a carpenter?

13:40.420 --> 13:44.075
No. He's an architect.
Not, like, pro, but, like, semi-pro.

13:45.556 --> 13:47.690
And his wife's a senator, by the way.

13:47.758 --> 13:51.282
No, she's an ambassador. Come on.
I got it.

13:51.402 --> 13:54.363
Brad Pitt's got New Orleans covered, right?
So, starving children in Africa.

13:54.431 --> 13:55.965
George Clooney's
taking care of them.

13:56.033 --> 13:56.966
What? Since when?

13:57.034 --> 13:59.802
Yeah. Since he won the Oscar, dude.
He's saving, like,

13:59.870 --> 14:02.842
all the starving kids, and then, he
sells them to Angelina Jolie,

14:02.854 --> 14:04.472
who flies them over here
and feeds them, bro.

14:04.540 --> 14:05.940
When did she become a pilot?

14:06.008 --> 14:08.569
Uh, right after she became
an ambassador, I guess.

14:08.689 --> 14:14.425
All right. I got it. Water. Clean
water. We work with water. It ties right in.

14:14.545 --> 14:18.217
Matt Damon's got the whole water thing
taken care of. Water.org, dude.

14:18.284 --> 14:19.251
What's Ben Affleck doing?

14:19.318 --> 14:20.418
Directing.

14:20.486 --> 14:22.787
God. Selfish. Selfish prick.

14:22.855 --> 14:24.576
All right. It's back to the old drawing board.

14:24.696 --> 14:26.623
Hey, you know, we have crayons and construction paper

14:26.743 --> 14:28.372
back at the house for you boys.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.339
Nice.

14:32.376 --> 14:34.754
I haven't used crayons and construction
paper since I was, like, 10.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.582
Etch-a-sketch.

14:37.514 --> 14:39.103
Hey, Tommy boy.
How's the wing, huh?

14:39.171 --> 14:39.971
Good.

14:40.039 --> 14:40.971
- Yeah?
- Feeling great. Yeah.

14:41.010 --> 14:42.007
Cool.

14:42.062 --> 14:44.774
Really getting some
movement back in it...

14:44.806 --> 14:47.037
Great. Hey, Jan.
What's going on?

14:48.614 --> 14:49.497
What?

14:50.916 --> 14:53.435
No, no, no. Actually, I don't think
those pants are too dressy at all

14:53.471 --> 14:54.671
but what top
are you going to wear?

14:56.161 --> 15:00.306
Really? What's the occasion?
Oh, yeah?

15:02.507 --> 15:04.595
No. You know, actually, I think
you're good with that combo.

15:04.662 --> 15:07.464
But the shoes are key.
You should go, like, you know, toeless or

15:07.716 --> 15:09.342
open toe or whatever.

15:10.401 --> 15:11.459
All right.

15:12.203 --> 15:13.870
Yeah. Yeah, he's right here.
Hold on.

15:14.839 --> 15:15.840
Wifey.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.244
Hey, what's up?

15:19.678 --> 15:21.673
Hello? Honey?

15:22.396 --> 15:23.517
Honey?

15:24.393 --> 15:26.350
Shit. Hon?

15:32.620 --> 15:34.615
Does Tommy seem a
little off to you, chief?

15:35.400 --> 15:36.958
Nah, he's all right.

15:37.430 --> 15:41.016
I don't know.
The way that guy was tag smack before,

15:41.067 --> 15:42.381
and Tommy just stood there taking it?

15:43.459 --> 15:45.389
Maybe you brought him back
a little too soon.

15:46.728 --> 15:49.718
Tommy's fine, OK?
Just needs to find his sea legs.

15:50.565 --> 15:53.477
It's Lou I'm worried about. See the gock?

15:57.082 --> 15:58.749
Nah, I think that's a Danish, chief.

15:59.019 --> 16:00.919
No, asshole, the gock.

16:01.039 --> 16:04.654
When a man loses his waistline and
his gut runs straight down to his cock,

16:04.694 --> 16:07.998
that's called the gock.
On a woman, it's called the gunt.

16:08.354 --> 16:12.376
No, you know what?
The technical term is fupa.

16:13.460 --> 16:15.751
Fat upper pubic area.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.466
- We're going with gock.
- Gock it is.

16:24.173 --> 16:25.663
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

16:26.271 --> 16:27.704
Hey, how about a soup kitchen?

16:27.772 --> 16:29.039
Soup kitchen? For what?

16:29.107 --> 16:30.688
- Hey, what did she say?
- Who?

16:30.808 --> 16:32.520
- Hey, none of your business. Really,
don't worry about it. - Janet.

16:32.554 --> 16:34.255
Well, if it's none of our business,
why are you talking about it

16:34.297 --> 16:35.102
in front of us, genius?

16:35.123 --> 16:37.646
Why are you listening to our conversation?
Why don't you just keep talking to Tommy?

16:37.714 --> 16:39.348
Well, I will keep talking to
Tommy, but now, my curiosity

16:39.416 --> 16:41.551
is piqued because you're being so
defensive about it.

16:41.618 --> 16:43.420
I mean, what's the deal?
You want to do something for charity?

16:43.454 --> 16:44.754
You hungry for something you
don't have to chew?

16:44.822 --> 16:47.451
We're trying to do some good
for the community, Frank, you know?

16:47.493 --> 16:51.192
That could be just as easily achieved as you
two shitheads hopping on a bus to Toledo.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.229
Yeah.

16:54.595 --> 16:55.928
Hey, hey, hey! Easy, easy!

16:55.996 --> 16:57.132
Shawn, stand down! Stand down!

16:57.252 --> 17:00.264
Hey, kids, enough already!
I will turn this truck around.

17:00.313 --> 17:01.202
Do it.

17:02.103 --> 17:04.905
All right. All right. Fine.
Now we're not stopping for ice cream.

17:04.973 --> 17:08.777
- Get him. Get him. Mike, Mike, get him.
- Jesus Christ. Shit.

17:09.644 --> 17:11.347
What, Lou?

17:13.114 --> 17:14.800
We're not stopping for ice cream.

17:19.320 --> 17:21.623
All right, fellas.
Let's get a little food order going here.

17:21.691 --> 17:22.924
What do you feel like eating?

17:22.992 --> 17:24.301
- Uh, Italian.
- American.

17:24.422 --> 17:26.094
- Mexican.
- French-Thai fusion.

17:26.162 --> 17:28.396
- Crepes.
- Chinese it is.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.500
French-Thai fusion?

17:40.379 --> 17:41.484
Hey.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.283
What are you guys doing?

17:44.351 --> 17:46.431
Hey. We brought you a little something.

17:48.686 --> 17:49.561
What's this?

17:49.891 --> 17:53.192
That, my dear nephew,
is a rare bottle of Irish whiskey.

17:53.260 --> 17:55.688
A little something to wish you
well on your first day back.

17:56.683 --> 17:59.364
Wow. This is really
top shelf stuff.

17:59.432 --> 18:02.668
Top shelf?
They keep that shit in the safe.

18:02.736 --> 18:05.171
That there is a distilled
work of art, my friend.

18:05.238 --> 18:07.340
Hell, I wish I could have
a taste of that myself.

18:07.407 --> 18:12.406
Well, I hate to tell you, boys, but
I ain't drinking whisky no more.

18:12.997 --> 18:15.555
Yep.
Strictly a wine man now.

18:15.675 --> 18:19.216
Oh, the wine.
Changing seats on the "Titanic," he is.

18:19.336 --> 18:20.993
Well, you can do whatever you want, Tom.

18:21.307 --> 18:23.990
We just came down to
wish you well on the job and in life.

18:24.495 --> 18:25.520
Really?

18:27.761 --> 18:28.961
What gives?

18:29.029 --> 18:30.859
We've come to the conclusion...

18:30.979 --> 18:34.133
That you're a lost cause, and now,
we got to cut you loose.

18:34.551 --> 18:38.391
Uh-huh, what's going on?

18:38.905 --> 18:42.240
I'm sorry, Tommy. What comes
next ain't going to be pretty.

18:42.308 --> 18:48.246
I love you, but I'm out of bullets,
both literally and figuratively.

18:48.313 --> 18:50.381
Going to miss you. Stay low.

18:50.632 --> 18:52.783
In vino veritas.

18:57.668 --> 19:01.139
Yeah, well, screw you, too.
What do you think of that?

19:26.114 --> 19:28.115
Engine.

19:28.183 --> 19:30.393
Ladder.

19:34.473 --> 19:37.742
Oh, please let this be a false
alarm for a change.

19:37.862 --> 19:39.344
It's, what, like, the
eighth call in a row?

19:39.464 --> 19:41.526
Yeah, not to mention those 3
wave-offs, right, though?

19:41.646 --> 19:43.394
I haven't even seen the
house since breakfast.

19:43.514 --> 19:46.054
Shit, man.
My legs are stiff as boards.

19:46.122 --> 19:48.725
Oh, that must make it tough
to run circles around people.

19:48.793 --> 19:50.644
- Not you, bitch.
- Oh, bitch?

19:50.764 --> 19:51.361
Yeah.

19:51.395 --> 19:54.642
I mean, the fire, the two water
main breaks, and the gas leak,

19:54.686 --> 19:58.087
I can understand. But three ODs,
5 sick calls,

19:58.207 --> 20:01.415
a guy with a beer bottle stuck up his ass
and that chick with the busted tit implant?

20:01.776 --> 20:03.282
Not what I signed up for.

20:03.402 --> 20:04.922
I'm not complaining about
that last one, though.

20:05.042 --> 20:06.614
Yeah, 'cause you felt
her up for three minutes.

20:06.734 --> 20:08.546
Yeah, well, asshole, it was
my job to feel her up.

20:08.573 --> 20:10.555
Oh, was it also your duty to
put your hand on her ass?

20:10.583 --> 20:11.782
Nothing wrong with being thorough.

20:11.849 --> 20:14.986
Amen to that.
Hey, Tommy, you OK?

20:15.053 --> 20:17.525
Yeah. Golden.

20:18.317 --> 20:23.098
You know, I was in that hospital bed for
about 4 weeks dreaming of a day like this.

20:23.440 --> 20:27.344
You guys are bitching and whining
and moaning about being busy.

20:27.464 --> 20:30.599
Why don't you put in for a transfer
to some house in Staten Island

20:30.655 --> 20:32.671
where you can sit around
with your dick in your hand?

20:32.739 --> 20:38.391
You know, you want to twitter and twatter
and download deaf mute porn online,

20:39.047 --> 20:44.585
why don't you run for congress?
Me, I'm happy being a firefighter again.

20:56.876 --> 20:58.870
All right.
What happened here?

20:58.938 --> 21:02.074
This young lady and her boyfriend were
walking down the street ahead of me.

21:02.408 --> 21:05.770
The boy, he dropped down the grate there
like a sack of potatoes.

21:06.814 --> 21:09.782
- Yeah. That's got to be 20, 30 feet, Tommy.
- At least.

21:09.902 --> 21:13.421
Ahh. Hey. Where's Lou?

21:13.782 --> 21:15.350
I don't know where he is, Tom.

21:15.418 --> 21:17.452
- All right. Who's going down?
- I'll do it.

21:17.572 --> 21:19.422
No, no. No.
You can take care of the crowd...

21:19.490 --> 21:21.891
- Why? I can do it. I...
- Are we having a conversation?

21:21.959 --> 21:25.145
Niels, watch the crowd.
Swing the ladder around.

21:25.265 --> 21:27.810
Franco, get a bucket and a board.
Two Shawns, harness up.

21:30.910 --> 21:34.108
Hey, you all right?
Can you hear me, kid?

21:37.128 --> 21:38.172
All right, boys. Here you go.

21:38.239 --> 21:39.272
Watch your leg.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.375
Keep an eye on that girl
at the corner, all right?

21:41.443 --> 21:43.344
Why don't you get your balls off my leg?

21:43.464 --> 21:45.414
Dude, why don't you get your
dirty black balls off of me, man? Shit?

21:45.481 --> 21:48.583
My balls are not dirty. They're black,
but they're not dirty. Ok?

21:48.651 --> 21:50.251
- Ahh.
- Yeah, go ahead.

21:51.381 --> 21:52.521
Watch the basket.

21:53.522 --> 21:55.524
- Get off of me, man.
- You get off of me!

21:56.016 --> 21:58.886
Hey, can't we all just get along?

22:04.131 --> 22:07.114
- Uh, we got him, Tom.
- Yeah? You got him on the board?

22:07.234 --> 22:08.773
- Yeah, doing it now.
- All right. Nice.

22:17.688 --> 22:19.903
All right.
Ok, guys.

22:19.971 --> 22:21.206
Easy.

22:26.117 --> 22:28.277
Easy, guys.

22:30.124 --> 22:31.409
Nice.

22:32.713 --> 22:34.166
Very nice.

22:34.233 --> 22:36.461
- He up?
- Yep.

22:38.525 --> 22:41.121
- He's up.
- All right.

22:49.961 --> 22:53.234
Get us out of here. Shawn's molesting
the hell out of me down here.

22:53.354 --> 22:54.726
You're molesting me.
Stop touching me.

22:54.794 --> 22:57.596
You touched me first, man come on.

22:57.664 --> 22:59.265
- I don't want you touching me like that...
- Nice job, guys.

22:59.533 --> 23:00.800
- My thigh, man.
- Really?

23:00.868 --> 23:02.335
Get your thigh off me like that.

23:02.403 --> 23:04.492
Tommy, get us out of here!
Come on.

23:05.694 --> 23:08.808
You know what?
We're leaving them down there.

23:08.875 --> 23:11.610
- Later, assholes.
- Hey, hey!

23:11.678 --> 23:12.544
Hello!

23:12.612 --> 23:14.179
Hey, yo!

23:14.246 --> 23:15.428
Hello?

23:28.860 --> 23:29.899
Hey.

23:31.439 --> 23:32.632
What are you doing?

23:32.700 --> 23:35.435
Oh, we ain't getting
any younger, my friend.

23:35.503 --> 23:36.395
You all right?

23:36.515 --> 23:38.909
Yeah. I think I pulled
something hopping off the rig.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.174
What's your excuse?

23:42.207 --> 23:43.342
I was doing your job.

23:43.678 --> 23:47.900
Delegating. Besides, I think it's good for
the guys, you know. It's good experience.

23:48.020 --> 23:51.825
You know, this Irish pride is going to put
both of us in our own grave, don't you?

23:53.479 --> 23:55.898
You're going to have to realize,
Tommy, you can't keep going at it

23:55.933 --> 23:58.163
like you're 25 for the rest of your life.

23:58.513 --> 24:01.508
Sooner or later, the machine,
it starts to break down. It already has.

24:02.296 --> 24:05.914
Let me tell you something, OK?
This shoulder?

24:06.234 --> 24:13.507
Couple of weeks from now, tip-top.
Tippy-top. You know.

24:13.778 --> 24:15.376
Shippity-shape.

24:15.443 --> 24:18.545
You can't even finish
your sentences anymore, Tom.

24:18.613 --> 24:21.987
There's no shame in being on the
other side of the peak, Tom.

24:23.183 --> 24:26.178
All right. I know what this is.

24:26.588 --> 24:28.693
You're using this as an excuse to

24:29.171 --> 24:33.204
give me your annual "why don't you become
a lieutenant, take the exam" speech.

24:33.324 --> 24:35.340
Tom, you really want to be
the guy 10 years from now

24:35.460 --> 24:37.781
holding onto your glory days
like you're some schmuck

24:37.823 --> 24:39.576
in the back row of a Springsteen concert?

24:39.627 --> 24:40.483
Come on. Who's a schmuck?
I'm not a schmuck..

24:40.550 --> 24:42.668
You want to be the guy that
the young guys are talking about,

24:42.701 --> 24:45.138
looking at you, saying, "Hey, that's
Tommy Gavin over there, man"

24:45.152 --> 24:47.352
He used to be the shit.
Now look at him"?

24:48.144 --> 24:50.047
I think you're afraid
of failing the test.

24:51.638 --> 24:55.856
Yeah. Yeah. I'm afraid... I'm
actually afraid of passing the test

24:55.976 --> 24:59.649
and end up like you...
40 pounds overweight and... and

24:59.769 --> 25:03.152
bleeding out from my papercutsk
from doing all the paperwork.

25:03.177 --> 25:04.482
- You... what?
- This isn't about me.

25:04.673 --> 25:07.139
Now, you know what?

25:07.679 --> 25:09.372
You should look in the mirror.
You ever take a look in the mirror?

25:09.399 --> 25:12.214
We all have our crosses to bear,
Tom, all right?

25:12.276 --> 25:15.464
Bulimics puke. Pill heads pop pills.

25:15.532 --> 25:19.849
Junkies shoot junk.
Drunks drink.

25:23.825 --> 25:28.802
I eat. Now, if you'll excuse me,
you're making me kind of hungry.

25:32.390 --> 25:35.502
And last month, would have been you
going down into that hole.

25:41.662 --> 25:42.625
Nice job.

25:45.596 --> 25:48.949
Good job, fellas.
You guys are make a good pair.

25:48.950 --> 25:50.728
- Thanks, man.
- Like Amos and Asshole.

25:50.982 --> 25:52.380
Which one of us is asshole?

25:52.556 --> 25:54.658
Here's a hint... Amos was black.

25:55.956 --> 25:57.523
Never should have asked.

25:57.558 --> 26:00.671
I'm sorry for calling you
and Mike stupid before.

26:00.791 --> 26:01.580
Oh, hey, man.

26:01.648 --> 26:05.391
You know, I'm just on edge, you know.
My girl is drinking,

26:05.511 --> 26:08.863
and it's that Gavin thing.
You know? It's a mess.

26:08.983 --> 26:11.267
Tell me about it.
I was married to her aunt for a while.

26:11.825 --> 26:13.326
I forgot you guys were hitched.

26:13.393 --> 26:14.861
Yeah. I wish I could forget.

26:14.929 --> 26:17.789
You know what? All I can tell you
is, you know,

26:17.909 --> 26:19.907
stick in it as long as you can,
fight the good fight, and,

26:20.027 --> 26:23.206
you know, at the end of the day,
if it's bad, that inner ref inside you?

26:23.326 --> 26:25.571
Put a stop to it. If not, I'll be
there to help you out.

26:26.429 --> 26:28.206
- Thanks, Sean.
- Hey, you got it.

26:28.274 --> 26:31.828
Yo, I got an idea for that good deeds
thing, if you want to hear about it.

26:31.948 --> 26:32.683
Yeah, man. Hit me.

26:32.684 --> 26:36.424
Ok, listen. You got cancer from working
down at ground zero, right?

26:36.425 --> 26:37.761
- Yes.
- And we had to foot the bill

26:37.881 --> 26:39.811
- because Uncle Sam ain't signing
any checks, right? -Right.

26:40.525 --> 26:43.347
A lot of other brothers on the job
are dealing with the same thing, so

26:43.467 --> 26:45.555
you could do
something like speak up on it,

26:45.623 --> 26:47.578
bring some attention
to the situation.

26:48.740 --> 26:49.788
I don't get it.

26:51.159 --> 26:54.185
No, I get it. No, I get it.
I do get it. That's a great idea.

26:54.186 --> 26:57.331
God, why didn't we think of that?
Mike is such an idiot.

26:58.086 --> 26:59.660
You said it, not me.

27:00.976 --> 27:02.128
Hey, thanks, pal.

27:06.791 --> 27:07.798
Hey.

27:08.065 --> 27:08.857
Hi.

27:08.977 --> 27:09.866
What's up?

27:09.933 --> 27:13.070
Well, I'm just calling to let
you know that it is officially

27:13.137 --> 27:16.924
17 past 6:00 in the evening, and
Colleen has already poured

27:17.044 --> 27:19.843
her third goblet of wine, and
she is still sober.

27:19.910 --> 27:22.246
Honey, I told you this was a great idea.

27:22.313 --> 27:24.915
And now, she's pouring
goblet number 4.

27:24.983 --> 27:25.849
Uh-huh.

27:25.917 --> 27:26.883
Is Franco there?

27:27.446 --> 27:28.351
Franco?

27:28.419 --> 27:29.886
Huh?

27:29.953 --> 27:32.490
Uh, Janet just wants to say hey.

27:32.491 --> 27:34.931
Oh, cool. Hey, Jan-Jan.
What's going on?

27:35.827 --> 27:37.548
Oh, yeah. I know.

27:38.523 --> 27:40.716
No, no, no. No. There's still
some in the house for sure.

27:40.836 --> 27:42.562
Did you check the medicine cabinet?

27:44.284 --> 27:46.895
Ok. What about the cupboard?

27:48.351 --> 27:52.304
Really? That's weird. Oh!
You know what? I know where it is.

27:52.305 --> 27:55.125
It's on the... you know that bookshelf
next to the dining room table?

27:55.245 --> 27:57.718
Yeah. Either that,
or in that little drawer next to the bed.

27:58.128 --> 28:03.530
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I know. You are so silly.

28:04.378 --> 28:06.883
All right.
I'll talk to you later. Bye, Jan-Jan.

28:08.094 --> 28:11.702
Hmm. Hey. Hello?

28:13.266 --> 28:14.878
Hmm. Disconnected.

28:15.937 --> 28:16.882
What were you guys laughing about?

28:16.883 --> 28:18.406
Huh? Oh, nothing.
Inside joke.

28:18.407 --> 28:19.868
Oh. Yeah.

28:20.475 --> 28:22.394
Huh. What was it...
Oh, about Vaseline.

28:22.514 --> 28:23.310
Ooh.

28:23.378 --> 28:27.035
For the kid.
Baby's got a rash. So silly.

28:27.155 --> 28:32.746
Yeah. Yeah. You know I get
those rashes. Yeah.

28:37.327 --> 28:39.780
You go got stuff to...Yeah.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.127
- You all right?
- Yeah.

28:43.018 --> 28:44.816
Jan-Jan. Mmm.

28:45.091 --> 28:46.451
Hey, you got a rash, Tom?

28:46.629 --> 28:49.471
Because, um, sometimes, like, a
little baby powder down there

28:49.539 --> 28:51.760
works great for the old bunker balls.

28:53.489 --> 28:54.869
Get away from me.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.362
- Get in the car.
- What are you doing?

29:14.363 --> 29:16.355
- Get in the car.
- I'm not getting in the car.

29:16.356 --> 29:19.578
Get in the car or I'll put those
naked photos I took of you

29:19.579 --> 29:21.395
up on my Facebook page.

29:21.396 --> 29:22.782
What naked photos?

29:23.463 --> 29:25.212
I'm... I'm get... I'm getting...

29:34.233 --> 29:35.442
Right.

29:39.308 --> 29:42.045
How is it going?
It's going good. It's busy.

29:42.046 --> 29:45.924
It's just, you know... it's good for me
just to getting right back, you know?

29:46.471 --> 29:49.718
I mean, my arm's
sore, but you know, it's weird.

29:49.762 --> 29:52.023
It's like, if I... Ahh.

29:52.143 --> 29:54.850
If I go, like, straight up like this
with this shoulder,

29:55.342 --> 29:58.800
right there, that's what
hurts me. It really kind of hurts.

30:02.366 --> 30:05.498
You don't really want
to know about... Ahh.

30:06.249 --> 30:08.087
You want to talk about Damian.

30:08.088 --> 30:09.959
- Mm-hmm.
- Ahem.

30:09.960 --> 30:13.068
- Yes, I do. - Ok.
- Well... he's not texting me back.

30:13.069 --> 30:16.478
He's not calling me. He's not even
coming for laundry night anymore.

30:16.777 --> 30:20.696
And I need to know, you
know, what the deal is.

30:21.699 --> 30:22.971
Everything's cool.

30:26.405 --> 30:27.494
What was that?

30:27.837 --> 30:30.120
Hmm. What?

30:31.026 --> 30:32.294
Unlock the door, Sheila.

30:32.295 --> 30:35.424
I will unlock the door
when you start talking.

30:35.716 --> 30:38.748
I'm a grown man, I can't
get out... come on.

30:39.128 --> 30:41.943
Yeah, grown man.
Childproof locks.

30:42.879 --> 30:44.180
I don't have any fingernails.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.737
You're not going to like
what I have to say.

30:51.868 --> 30:58.065
He kind of, sort of, uh,
pretty much did solo save.

30:58.325 --> 30:59.533
Oh, God.

30:59.601 --> 31:01.146
- And...
- Oh, my God.

31:01.147 --> 31:04.706
The department's going to
give him a, you know, thing.

31:04.774 --> 31:06.790
- A what? What?
- A medal.

31:06.910 --> 31:08.315
Ohh!

31:08.351 --> 31:09.711
Listen, he's going to be a hero.

31:10.113 --> 31:11.913
What the Frick is he doing being a hero?
He's supposed to

31:11.981 --> 31:14.492
get out of the dumb job,
not get medals for it.

31:14.493 --> 31:15.549
Ok. What do you want?

31:15.550 --> 31:18.593
You know, the kid's
got a knack for it. There was

31:18.594 --> 31:20.811
a kid who was, you know, trapped
under a collapsed building.

31:20.931 --> 31:24.235
What do you mean, there was a kid...
you let him go into a collapsed building?

31:24.236 --> 31:25.168
No.

31:26.196 --> 31:27.446
Yes. Wait!

31:27.566 --> 31:30.588
The building didn't really completely
collapse until after he pulled the kid out...

31:30.604 --> 31:31.654
- Oh!
- Where is your... where is it?

31:31.655 --> 31:33.881
Ow! Ow! Ow! God damn it!

31:34.114 --> 31:38.159
What do you want me to do, reorder
the kid's goddamn DNA?

31:38.206 --> 31:40.869
You know, he... most people would be

31:40.989 --> 31:45.190
ecstatic about this.
They'd be full of pride and happy.

31:47.494 --> 31:48.423
You're right.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.113
I am?

31:50.264 --> 31:52.349
Yes, you are totally right.

31:52.350 --> 31:54.677
'Cause you know what,
at least he only got

31:54.935 --> 31:59.726
the hero Gavin gene instead
of the raging, alcoholic,

31:59.727 --> 32:03.927
sex fiend, angry, asshole gene.

32:05.664 --> 32:08.788
- I'm referring to you.
- I know who you're referring to.

32:09.303 --> 32:13.387
I'm a little fed up with this blame me,
I'm always the guilty one, me me me me.

32:13.421 --> 32:14.260
What about you?

32:14.822 --> 32:15.762
- What about...
- What?

32:15.796 --> 32:16.578
What about me?

32:16.579 --> 32:17.617
Ha ha!

32:17.618 --> 32:19.854
Ha ha, go ahead, what?
Find something.

32:20.045 --> 32:22.168
Ok. You want something,
I'll give you so...

32:22.169 --> 32:23.494
Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.

32:23.549 --> 32:25.239
The mothering thing, OK?

32:26.051 --> 32:28.486
You're smothering him with the
moth... you're a smothers mother,

32:28.554 --> 32:29.420
that's what you are.

32:29.488 --> 32:30.355
You know what I mean?

32:30.422 --> 32:32.893
It's like a pillow... a love
pillow that you're holding

32:32.937 --> 32:36.155
over the kid. He can't breathe.
I'm telling you. You gotta...

32:36.524 --> 32:40.093
You're too emotional, and
you care, and you're too

32:40.094 --> 32:43.260
loving. You need to, like,
you know, like, be more...

32:43.261 --> 32:44.708
What, be more like your mother?

32:45.747 --> 32:48.617
5 packs a day and colder
than a kitchen...

32:48.737 --> 32:51.942
Hey, she had a house full of kids, OK?
And she was doing it with no money and she was

32:52.062 --> 32:53.956
married to a guy who was a
firefighter, was a raging

32:53.957 --> 32:55.899
alcoholic and would never admit
it, and had 3 girlfriends

32:55.900 --> 32:58.279
on the side. All he thought about
was drinking and sex and himself.

33:02.083 --> 33:03.185
Shut up.

33:08.052 --> 33:09.632
- You're doing a great job.
- Thank you.

33:09.633 --> 33:10.378
You're welcome.

33:14.251 --> 33:16.718
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey.

33:16.719 --> 33:19.263
- Hey.
- What are you doing here, ma?

33:20.179 --> 33:23.258
- Whose car is this?
- This is a loaner 'cause

33:23.259 --> 33:24.938
mine's in the shop.

33:24.939 --> 33:26.543
Honey, you look so tired.

33:26.611 --> 33:28.162
How about you answer
my first question?

33:28.163 --> 33:29.279
Which was what?

33:29.346 --> 33:30.651
What are you doing here?

33:31.001 --> 33:35.629
I... I'm here to talk to Tommy
about something that is

33:36.661 --> 33:40.366
- totally unrelated to you.
- Oh, yeah? What?

33:42.530 --> 33:44.530
Kitchen... appliances.

33:44.531 --> 33:47.163
- Stoves. Talking about stoves.
- Tommy, get out of the car.

33:47.230 --> 33:48.231
I can't.

33:48.232 --> 33:49.170
Christ!

33:49.962 --> 33:50.553
Go.

33:50.554 --> 33:52.036
Thanks.

33:52.884 --> 33:54.539
Hey.
Hey, stay close.

33:54.540 --> 33:55.767
This won't take long.

33:55.768 --> 33:56.778
All right.

34:22.072 --> 34:23.074
Everything all right?

34:24.027 --> 34:25.498
For me? Yeah.

34:35.581 --> 34:36.725
Ahh.

34:41.538 --> 34:42.905
Ahem.

34:44.233 --> 34:45.184
What?

34:46.601 --> 34:47.925
What?

34:48.463 --> 34:50.192
Nothing. We're good.

34:53.385 --> 34:54.284
We are?

34:54.590 --> 34:55.788
Yeah.

34:56.299 --> 34:58.868
We are very good, thank you.

35:02.257 --> 35:03.391
What's going on?

35:04.061 --> 35:06.678
- Did I miss something, or...
- Hmm? No, no, no.

35:06.679 --> 35:07.450
You didn't miss anything.

35:07.518 --> 35:11.958
I just... I just realized that,
you know, you've tried

35:11.959 --> 35:16.346
your hardest and you have been
the best uncle you could be,

35:16.347 --> 35:18.794
and the best friend that you could be,

35:18.862 --> 35:25.266
and I honestly, I thank you for that.
And you are released.

35:28.796 --> 35:32.218
I, um, released from what?

35:37.292 --> 35:38.340
Ahh!

35:38.341 --> 35:39.426
Ha ha!

35:40.294 --> 35:41.174
Whoo!

35:43.520 --> 35:44.755
- Hiya, Sheila.
- Hey!

35:44.756 --> 35:46.697
Tommy, tea time's over.
Come on, let's go.

35:46.698 --> 35:48.597
- Tea time's over.
- Ok.

35:51.935 --> 35:55.009
- Do you want me to drive you to the fire?
- No.

36:00.194 --> 36:01.457
Tommy, shit's burning!

36:01.458 --> 36:03.114
- I am going, I'm going.
- Let's move.

36:03.806 --> 36:05.157
Good talk!

36:32.602 --> 36:33.474
Ah.

36:36.118 --> 36:38.496
- Thanks.
- Take your pack.

36:43.944 --> 36:44.825
What do we got, Lou?

36:44.826 --> 36:47.061
There's still two inside,
one male, one female.

36:47.062 --> 36:48.242
Any word on the source?

36:48.243 --> 36:49.773
Well, Tommy's alibi is solid.

36:49.774 --> 36:51.214
He was getting a lecture
from my mother.

36:51.215 --> 36:53.003
Hey, funny girl, game face.

36:53.004 --> 36:56.318
Lou, Tommy, Franco, black Shawn,
you go inside, look for stragglers.

36:56.438 --> 36:57.759
You take spicy
and go around the back.

36:57.760 --> 36:59.008
- Get my tools.
- Sure, man.

36:59.799 --> 37:01.795
- Ah, God damn it.
- You OK?

37:02.347 --> 37:03.720
Ah, yeah, I'm OK.

37:03.788 --> 37:06.344
We're going into a burning church
and you're asking me if I'm OK?

37:06.345 --> 37:07.374
All right, go.

37:07.375 --> 37:08.689
Ahh.

37:09.726 --> 37:11.436
Fire department, anybody here?

37:11.437 --> 37:12.635
Hello?

37:13.181 --> 37:15.124
Fire department!

37:15.311 --> 37:17.384
Oh, you guys, take upstairs.

37:17.385 --> 37:18.237
All right, Lou.

37:18.437 --> 37:21.974
FDNY, fire department, anybody here?

37:26.147 --> 37:28.470
Hey, check the closet.
I'm going to check over here.

37:31.674 --> 37:36.263
Ow! I found her! Lou!
We got a 1045, female.

37:36.858 --> 37:39.598
- Rest of the floor is clear.
- Alright, bring her down.

37:41.699 --> 37:42.711
Ah!

37:43.134 --> 37:45.131
All right, sir, hold on,
we're coming to get you.

37:45.663 --> 37:48.564
- Where are you?
- Oh, jeez!

37:49.527 --> 37:50.955
Sir, you gotta get out of here!

37:50.956 --> 37:53.039
No, please!
This is my parish!

37:53.040 --> 37:53.916
She's in there!

37:53.917 --> 37:54.791
We gotta get you out of here!

37:55.047 --> 37:56.078
Come on!

37:56.803 --> 37:57.599
I got it, I got it.

37:58.051 --> 37:58.900
I got it.

38:03.514 --> 38:06.140
The fire out?

38:06.141 --> 38:07.244
Go away.

38:09.343 --> 38:11.478
- Hey, where's Tommy?
- He's coming out.

38:11.479 --> 38:12.578
Did he get the grab?

38:12.583 --> 38:14.079
- Yes, he did.
- Yes, he did.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.154
Got it.
Hey.

38:15.312 --> 38:16.188
Where's the girl?

38:16.308 --> 38:17.440
- You're lookin' at her.
- This?

38:17.475 --> 38:20.680
God bless you. You saved Mary.
God bless you.

38:20.681 --> 38:21.875
There you go. You got her?

38:21.995 --> 38:23.839
This statue is worth a fortune.

38:23.955 --> 38:26.238
Our parish had it shipped over
at the turn of the century

38:26.239 --> 38:30.242
from the Vatican, where
it stood for 575 years.

38:30.478 --> 38:32.033
Oh, Mary.

38:32.821 --> 38:36.481
Oh, God, oh, God, what
happened back here?

38:36.631 --> 38:38.328
- What?
- Look here.

38:38.448 --> 38:40.373
- Where?
- Right here.

38:41.235 --> 38:42.182
Where... where?

38:42.989 --> 38:44.657
There's a hole in it.

38:44.980 --> 38:47.475
No, I think that's where she's, like,
attached to the wall, you know?

38:47.489 --> 38:48.900
Mary has never been attached.

38:48.987 --> 38:50.270
I know every inch of her.

38:50.271 --> 38:52.275
That looks like a hole that
was meant to... you know,

38:52.276 --> 38:53.575
- I don't... I didn't...
- No.

38:53.789 --> 38:56.092
- No?
- No. This is not how I left her.

38:56.342 --> 38:57.221
That's how I found her.

38:57.222 --> 39:00.226
- I mean, it was...
- Well, this is not how I left her.

39:00.513 --> 39:02.469
Hey, there was a couple
corners down there,

39:02.470 --> 39:05.670
and there was a staircase maybe...
What am I saying?

39:05.738 --> 39:08.136
You know? You sent me into a
room full of smoke and flame

39:08.137 --> 39:09.607
to pull out a chunk of plastic.

39:09.675 --> 39:14.040
Hey, Gavin, nice, nice grab, man. I hope
you copped a good feel on the way out.

39:15.763 --> 39:16.994
Oh!

39:17.440 --> 39:19.001
That's the blessed
virgin mother, asshole!

39:19.002 --> 39:20.240
All right, Tommy, come on!

39:24.985 --> 39:26.448
Unbelievable.

39:27.467 --> 39:28.504
Sorry about that, father.

39:28.505 --> 39:30.677
- I guess I lost my...
- No, don't be sorry.

39:31.287 --> 39:33.885
I'm only pissed that you
beat me to the punch.

39:34.563 --> 39:36.644
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:40.407 --> 39:41.632
Is it real?

39:42.255 --> 39:43.801
- Stop playing.
- Who cares?

39:45.518 --> 39:47.488
I called Bobby and had
him put an order in.

39:47.822 --> 39:49.634
- Wow.
- Dig in, fellas.

39:50.163 --> 39:52.879
- Oh, pepperoni!
- No, no, no, go get Lou.

39:53.054 --> 39:53.890
Go get Lou.

39:53.957 --> 39:59.764
That was a tour for the ages, gentlemen.
35 calls in one shift is no easy feat.

39:59.966 --> 40:01.448
I'm proud of you.

40:03.400 --> 40:06.392
- What?
- What's with the bag?

40:07.593 --> 40:09.455
All right, we're not waiting.

40:09.575 --> 40:10.927
This is for you, Gavin.

40:13.854 --> 40:15.489
- Is this from Uncle Teddy?
- Open it up.

40:15.609 --> 40:17.867
No, this is from us.
It's a welcome back gift.

40:22.587 --> 40:25.848
- Ahh. I swear to God...
- Oh, everything's fine.

40:25.968 --> 40:26.941
Boom!

40:28.941 --> 40:30.144
What?

40:32.978 --> 40:34.468
Bet you don't have one of these.

40:34.866 --> 40:37.476
This is so everybody knows
where you live.

40:38.009 --> 40:41.221
And this is where HQ is going
to aim when they come after us.

40:41.341 --> 40:43.051
- Is this kevlar?
- Kevlar.

40:43.171 --> 40:45.757
Hey, hey, something's wrong with Lou.

40:45.877 --> 40:48.593
Well, let me guess,
he lost his appetite.

40:49.169 --> 40:52.463
Lou lost his appetite? There's something
wrong with the universe.

40:54.318 --> 40:56.909
- Over here, see?
- What's wrong with Lou?

40:57.852 --> 40:59.673
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?
