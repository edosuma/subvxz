WEBVTT

00:28.778 --> 00:29.696
HOW'S IT GOING?

00:29.779 --> 00:31.489
TOMMY RICHARDSON'S
LOOKING FOR YOU.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.283
HAS HE GOT FLOWERS?

00:36.369 --> 00:37.954
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

00:37.996 --> 00:39.873
DON'T YOU WANT
YOUR DELEGATE?

00:48.882 --> 00:50.300
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:50.341 --> 00:52.135
MY WIFE'S GONNA
BE HERE AT 9:15,

00:52.218 --> 00:53.470
OFF OF YOU GUYS
CALLING HER.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.597
THIS IS AFTER SHE DROPS
OUR DAUGHTER OFF AT SCHOOL.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.640
GLAD SOMEBODY IN YOUR
FAMILY'S COOPERATING.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.852
I DID NOT KILL THIS GIRL,
SIPOWICZ, AND NOTHIN' WAS
GOIN' ON BETWEEN US.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.854
YOU MAKE OPPOSITE
INFERENCES TO LAURIE,

01:02.937 --> 01:06.316
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
YOU'RE GONNA DESTROY
MY MARRIAGE AND FAMILY.

01:06.357 --> 01:09.903
DESK SERGEANT SAID YOU GUYS
WERE IN HERE. MORNING.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.321
YEAH. MORNIN'.

01:11.362 --> 01:12.822
IT'S YOU TALKING TO ME
AND SIMONE LIKE JERKS

01:12.906 --> 01:13.948
EVERY TIME YOU
OPEN YOUR MOUTH

01:13.990 --> 01:15.658
MAKES US TAKE
THIS TACT AT ALL.

01:15.742 --> 01:16.826
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
HIS WIFE COMIN' IN.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.161
HOW AM I MAKIN' YOU
LOOK LIKE JERKS?

01:18.203 --> 01:20.705
IT'S THIS, TOMMY--
ALL THE OPERA.

01:22.332 --> 01:25.251
ALL RIGHT, LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION, THEORETICALLY.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.920
THEORETICALLY, IF I SAID

01:27.003 --> 01:30.590
MAYBE THERE'D BEEN
A ROMANTIC ASPECT
WITH ME AND DARLENE...

01:30.673 --> 01:31.841
PAST WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.635
IF I WAS THEORETICALLY
CANDID WITH THAT,

01:33.676 --> 01:34.761
WOULD YOU HAVE TO PRESS IT
WITH LAURIE?

01:34.844 --> 01:36.846
WE DON'T WANT TO PRESS HER
ON NOTHING, TOMMY.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.306
YOU KNOW,
THIS COULD SHOCK YOU,

01:38.348 --> 01:40.100
BUT YOU MAY NOT BE
THE FIRST COP

01:40.183 --> 01:42.936
EMPLOYED HIS JOHNSON
ON SEVERAL FRONTS
SIMULTANEOUSLY.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.355
IS THAT WHAT WAS
HAPPENING, TOMMY?

01:45.396 --> 01:48.274
GIVE US SOMETHING
WE CAN BELIEVE,
THE 3 OF US ARE DONE.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.485
YOUR WIFE COMES IN,
WE'LL ASK HER SOME
GENERAL QUESTIONS

01:50.527 --> 01:53.196
ABOUT HER FRIENDSHIP
WITH DARLENE, WE'LL BE
THROUGH WITH HER, TOO.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.447
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!

01:56.825 --> 01:59.077
CERTAIN OCCASIONS...

01:59.160 --> 02:00.537
I'D STOP OFF, SEE DARLENE.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.914
SOME ASPECT
MIGHT BE PHYSICAL...

02:02.997 --> 02:06.417
BASED ON OUR LONG-STANDING
PREVIOUS FRIENDSHIP.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.752
GOOD.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.630
WHICH IS NOTHING, WHATSOEVER,
CONNECTED WITH HER DEATH.

02:10.713 --> 02:11.714
UNDERSTOOD.

02:11.756 --> 02:14.425
WE UNDERSTAND
THAT'S YOUR POSITION.

02:14.509 --> 02:15.635
MY POSITION?!

02:15.718 --> 02:17.387
WE UNDERSTAND
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

02:17.470 --> 02:18.888
YOU SAID I COPPED
TO AN OCCASIONAL ASPECT,
THAT WAS IT.

02:18.930 --> 02:22.433
NOBODY'S GONNA SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT TO
YOUR WIFE, RICHARDSON,

02:22.517 --> 02:24.435
WHICH IS WHAT YOU WERE
SAYING YOU WERE WORRIED
ABOUT.

02:24.519 --> 02:27.397
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
YOU GUYS TURNIN' MY LIFE
INTO A CRUCIFIXION.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.482
TOMMY, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
ANSWERS QUESTIONS,

02:29.566 --> 02:31.317
BUT IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS
IT RAISES QUESTIONS, TOO.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.819
LOUSY BLOODSUCKERS.

02:32.902 --> 02:35.613
WAS THAT OVER,
YOU BANGING DARLENE?

02:35.697 --> 02:37.574
THE 2 OF YOU
HAVE A BEEF?

02:37.657 --> 02:38.908
TOMMY, DID DARLENE
EVER THREATEN YOU?

02:38.950 --> 02:40.618
SAY SHE MIGHT
TALK TO LAURIE?

02:40.702 --> 02:42.036
NO.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.248
NO.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.586
YOU ALL RIGHT,
RICHARDSON?

02:49.627 --> 02:52.589
I DID NOT KILL THIS GIRL.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.924
BUT I SWEAR,
YOU MAKE MY WIFE UNHAPPY

02:54.966 --> 02:57.886
OR WHERE OUR CHILD'S LIFE
IS HUMILIATING...

02:57.927 --> 03:00.763
I WILL COME AFTER
THE BOTH OF YA.

03:07.645 --> 03:08.938
OPEN OR CLOSED?

03:08.980 --> 03:10.023
CLOSED.

03:12.817 --> 03:14.819
EVERY YEAR,
FOR HIS SCHOOL
PASSION PLAY,

03:14.903 --> 03:17.071
TOMMY GOES
FOR THE MAIN ROLE.

03:17.113 --> 03:20.366
SO HE'S A PHONY
AND A CHEAT,
THIS TOMMY.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.285
DID HE KILL
HIS GIRLFRIEND?

03:22.327 --> 03:24.287
YEAH, THAT'S
ANOTHER QUESTION.

04:40.989 --> 04:41.906
HI, JILL.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.200
HEY, WELCOME BACK.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.660
THANKS FOR YOUR CARD.

04:45.743 --> 04:48.413
WELL, I DIDN'T
WANT TO BE CALLING

04:48.454 --> 04:51.082
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO TALK.

04:51.165 --> 04:53.251
BOBBY'S BEEN SAYING FLU,

04:53.334 --> 04:55.586
BUT I WAS, UM...

04:55.670 --> 04:59.674
HALFWAY THINKING IT
MIGHT BE SOMETHING ELSE.

04:59.757 --> 05:02.176
I, UM...

05:02.260 --> 05:04.679
I LOST THE PREGNANCY.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.931
I'M SORRY.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.767
I MUST HAVE BEEN
SUPPOSED TO, YOU KNOW?

05:11.811 --> 05:13.730
[OPENING PADLOCK]

05:13.771 --> 05:17.942
I, UH, I LOST
MY FIRST PREGNANCY.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.611
HOW DID YOU FEEL
AFTERWARD?

05:20.653 --> 05:23.614
I COULDN'T STOP CRYING.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.241
YOU COULDN'T?

05:25.283 --> 05:27.410
MY HUSBAND HELPED,
SAID IT WAS HORMONES

05:27.452 --> 05:29.704
AND PULL MYSELF
TOGETHER.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.042
HAS BOBBY
BEEN THERE FOR YOU?

05:34.125 --> 05:36.127
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.921
I'VE FELT GUILTY
NOT BEING THERE FOR HIM.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.466
GUILTY ABOUT THAT
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

05:41.549 --> 05:42.925
I'VE FELT GUILTY

05:42.967 --> 05:45.136
ABOUT A FEW OTHER THINGS,
TOO, YOU KNOW?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.637
DON'T, DIANE.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.100
YOU WEREN'T TOO ACTIVE.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.644
YOU DIDN'T TAKE
UNNECESSARY CHANCES.

05:55.146 --> 05:58.983
ARE YOU RELATED
TO THE AMAZING KRESKIN?

06:00.985 --> 06:04.447
IT'S NATURE LOOKING OUT
FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.121
YOU READY?

06:12.997 --> 06:14.165
YEAH.

06:18.836 --> 06:20.588
Medavoy: I'M ON MY WAY.

06:20.671 --> 06:24.384
I-I'LL BE ON THE ROAD
WITHIN MINUTES.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.678
DO NOT DISSUADE
OR DETAIN ME, ABBY.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.515
YEAH, I'LL CALL YOU
IN A FEW HOURS,

06:30.556 --> 06:32.183
WHEN--WHEN I'M AN HOUR
OR SO AWAY.

06:32.266 --> 06:35.019
UH, WITH YOU
AT THE HOSPITAL,

06:35.061 --> 06:37.980
WILL SOMEONE BE
AT YOUR PARENTS' HOUSE
TO ANSWER?

06:38.022 --> 06:39.899
FINE. ALL RIGHT, THEN.

06:39.982 --> 06:42.610
I-I'LL SEE YOU IN, UH,
3 HOURS' TIME.

06:42.693 --> 06:44.987
TRY AND WAIT
TILL I GET THERE.

06:45.029 --> 06:47.865
ONLY JOKIN', OF COURSE.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.034
EXIT 9-N? GOOD.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.036
WHEW!

06:54.705 --> 06:56.624
ABBY'S IN LABOR.

06:56.707 --> 06:59.168
I'M HEADING UPSTATE
FOR THE DELIVERY.

07:00.711 --> 07:04.966
ABBY'S IN--IN LABOR
IN BALLSTON SPA, LIEU.

07:05.049 --> 07:07.385
I FEEL LIKE
I OUGHTA BE UP THERE.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.887
IF YOU'RE
NOT WORKING A CASE,
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.722
YEAH. I'D LIKE
TO GET ON THE ROAD.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.808
IT'S A 3 HOURS' DRIVE.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.268
GIVE HER OUR BEST.

07:15.351 --> 07:19.188
YEAH. EXIT 9-N.
STRAIGHT SHOT UP THE THRUWAY.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.400
OK, UH...

07:22.483 --> 07:23.776
GOOD-BYE, ALL.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.653
I'M OFF FOR ABBY'S DELIVERY.

07:25.736 --> 07:26.696
DRIVE CAREFULLY, GREG.

07:26.737 --> 07:27.738
YEAH, RIGHT.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.575
DOLORES.

07:30.658 --> 07:31.659
SO LONG.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.165
ABBY'S IN LABOR.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.083
THEY'LL EXPLAIN.

07:40.168 --> 07:43.087
SOUNDS PRETTY
SELF-EXPLANATORY.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.422
GOOD MORNING, DOLORES.

07:44.505 --> 07:45.423
GOOD MORNING.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.341
DID YOU SEE GREG?

07:47.425 --> 07:52.680
HE SUGGESTED WE INQUIRE
IN HERE HOW IT IS
WOMEN GO INTO LABOR.

07:52.763 --> 07:56.309
AHEM. ANY PATTERNS
IN THE 61s FOR YOUR D.O.A.'s
NEIGHBORHOOD?

07:56.392 --> 07:58.269
IT WOULD HAVE HAD
TO HAVE BEEN A PUSH-IN.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.771
HOMICIDE OFF
AN UNFORCED ENTRY.

08:00.855 --> 08:01.731
AHEM.

08:01.772 --> 08:03.107
Tommy: HERE.
THEY'RE IN HERE.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.192
ALL RIGHT.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.443
TOMMY.

08:05.526 --> 08:06.569
THIS IS
MY WIFE LAURIE.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.695
BOBBY SIMONE.

08:07.778 --> 08:10.573
ANDY SIPOWICZ.
HOW'S IT GOING?

08:10.615 --> 08:11.699
HI, ANDY.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.284
ALL RIGHT, SO THEY DON'T
WANT ME WITH YOU.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.535
ALL RIGHT.

08:14.619 --> 08:15.786
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.247
YOU SHOULD BE OUTTA HERE
IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES.

08:18.289 --> 08:22.460
YEAH, WHATEVER. IF I'M
NOT DOWNSTAIRS AFTER,
I'LL SEE YOU HOME.

08:24.045 --> 08:28.049
CALL ME IF YOU WANT
AFTER, OR I'LL CALL YOU.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.634
ALL RIGHT, TOMMY.

08:32.637 --> 08:34.430
COFFEE, LAURIE?

08:34.472 --> 08:36.933
NO. I...

08:36.974 --> 08:39.101
I-I'D LOVE A GLASS
OF WATER, THOUGH.

08:39.143 --> 08:41.103
LET'S TALK IN HERE.

08:43.189 --> 08:47.068
TOMMY SAYS
NO DRINKING COFFEE WHILE
I'M TALKING TO YOU GUYS.

08:47.151 --> 08:49.320
YEAH, HUH?

08:49.403 --> 08:51.864
TOMMY'S UNDERSTANDABLY
UPSET ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO DARLENE,

08:51.948 --> 08:53.991
WHY I THINK
HE'S NERVOUS FOR YOU.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.660
WELL,
THEY KNEW EACH OTHER
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL,

08:55.743 --> 08:56.786
AND SHE REMAINED
A CLOSE FRIEND.

08:56.827 --> 08:59.997
YOU CAN GO AHEAD
AND SIT DOWN.

09:00.039 --> 09:04.085
TOMMY SAID THAT,
UH, YOU AND DARLENE
BECAME FRIENDS, ALSO.

09:06.003 --> 09:09.507
WE BECAME
CLOSE FRIENDS, TOO...

09:09.590 --> 09:12.385
STRANGE AS THAT MAY SEEM
FOR A FORMER GIRLFRIEND.

09:12.468 --> 09:16.055
[SOBS]

09:16.138 --> 09:18.349
OH, BOY.

09:18.432 --> 09:19.892
YEAH, IT'S UPSETTING, HUH?

09:19.976 --> 09:22.270
IT'S JUST SO AWFUL
FOR HER TO BE KILLED,

09:22.353 --> 09:24.230
AND I-I'VE...

09:24.313 --> 09:26.524
I'VE NEVER HAD THIS TYPE
CONVERSATION BEFORE,

09:26.607 --> 09:29.360
STRANGE AS THAT MAY SEEM
FOR A COP'S WIFE.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.196
ANY IDEA WHO COULD HAVE
KILLED DARLENE?

09:32.280 --> 09:35.074
I KNOW...TOMMY
WASN'T INVOLVED,

09:35.157 --> 09:37.535
WHICH I KNOW...IS WHAT
YOU'RE SUSPECTING.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.537
TOMMY THINKS WE FEEL
THAT WAY, LAURIE,

09:39.620 --> 09:42.498
BUT WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.001
I MEAN,
IT'S--IT'S SO HARD
FOR PEOPLE TO BELIEVE

09:45.042 --> 09:46.627
IN A MAN-WOMAN
FRIENDSHIP.

09:46.711 --> 09:50.339
NOWADAYS, THAT'S
DEFINITELY TRUE.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.633
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE
SO RELUCTANT TO BELIEVE

09:52.717 --> 09:55.928
THAT CRAZY MAN
MURDERED HER, BECAUSE
THAT TYPE BEFRIENDING

09:56.012 --> 09:57.430
WAS SO EXACTLY
LIKE DARLENE.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.515
WELL, THAT'S WHY
WE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU,

09:59.557 --> 10:02.059
GET A BETTER SENSE
OF HER PERSONALITY.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.144
THAT'S WHY?

10:03.227 --> 10:05.313
LAURIE, UM, AHEM,

10:05.396 --> 10:08.149
WHAT DID DARLENE
SAY ABOUT JASON?

10:08.232 --> 10:10.651
THAT HE'D BEEN
A PATIENT ON HER UNIT,

10:10.735 --> 10:12.612
AND HE SEEMED LIKE
HE HAD A CRUSH ON HER,

10:12.695 --> 10:15.364
AND--AND SHE THOUGHT
HE WAS NICE.

10:15.406 --> 10:16.574
SHE MENTION BEING
AFRAID OF HIM AT ALL?

10:16.616 --> 10:19.577
NO. NO, BUT THAT WAS
SO EXACTLY LIKE HER.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.705
AND NOT REALIZING
HE'D STOPPED TAKING
HIS MEDICATION.

10:22.747 --> 10:26.667
SHE TOLD YOU
THAT SHE'D FOUND OUT
THAT HE'D STOPPED?

10:27.668 --> 10:29.962
NO...

10:30.046 --> 10:32.548
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE I HEARD THAT.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.509
LAURIE, YOU FEEL DARLENE
WOULDN'T HAVE NOTICED

10:35.593 --> 10:37.803
A GUY HIDING MEDS
UNDER HIS TONGUE?

10:37.887 --> 10:40.139
THAT'S MY POINT...

10:40.222 --> 10:42.099
IS HOW TRUSTING SHE WAS.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.101
FLOOR NURSE
AT A MENTAL WARD...

10:44.185 --> 10:46.687
WELL, YOU'D THINK SHE'D
BE PRETTY EXPERIENCED

10:46.771 --> 10:49.065
BEING CAREFUL
HE DIDN'T DO THAT.

10:49.106 --> 10:52.276
I'M JUST SAYING...

10:52.360 --> 10:55.279
YOU DON'T
BELIEVE THAT...

10:55.321 --> 10:59.408
BUT BEING OVER LATE,
YOU WANT TO CONVICT
MY HUSBAND.

11:00.451 --> 11:01.827
OH, BOY.

11:05.414 --> 11:10.628
CAN YOU
THINK OF ANYONE ELSE
WE SHOULD BE TALKING TO?

11:12.630 --> 11:14.882
OK, LAURIE.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.176
ARE WE FINISHED?

11:17.259 --> 11:18.803
YEAH. ALL DONE.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.721
[SOBS]
THANKS FOR COMING IN.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.099
ALL RIGHT,
THEN, UH...

11:23.140 --> 11:26.143
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW WORRIED I WAS
DRIVING IN.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.812
HOPE THE REST
OF THE MORNING'S BETTER.

11:27.895 --> 11:31.315
SO, DO YOU--DO YOU
FEEL TOMMY'S EXONERATED,

11:31.357 --> 11:34.652
AND--AND THAT THEY
JUST HAD A MAN-WOMAN
FRIENDSHIP?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.987
WE ARE LOOKING
AT A LOT OF ALTERNATIVES.

11:37.029 --> 11:40.741
HE WASN'T WRONG
WHEN HE TOLD US
ABOUT HIS WIFE.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.245
YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF OUT.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.084
HAVE A GOOD MORNING.

11:58.509 --> 11:59.927
THIS PRICK.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.237
I'M DETECTIVE RUSSELL.
THIS IS DETECTIVE
KIRKENDALL.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.114
ALJUAN RAYFORD. THIS IS
MY GIRLFRIEND LISETTE.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.282
JILL KIRKENDALL.

12:21.323 --> 12:22.324
HI.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.581
I GOT ROBBED LAST NIGHT.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.332
COPS AT THE HOSPITAL SAID
I HAD TO TALK TO YOU GUYS

12:30.374 --> 12:31.333
TO GET MY DOCTOR BILL
COVERED.

12:31.375 --> 12:34.503
HE ALMOST GOT KILLED
OVER A DAMN CAMERA.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.005
OK, LISETTE.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.592
I'M A FILM STUDENT
OVER AT NYU.

12:39.675 --> 12:43.554
LAST NIGHT I WAS SHOOTIN'
MY SENIOR PROJECT OVER
ON AVENUE "A" AND 14th,

12:43.637 --> 12:45.514
WHEN THESE
2 LITTLE KNUCKLEHEADS
WALKED UP ON ME.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.599
CAN YOU DESCRIBE THEM?

12:46.682 --> 12:47.808
BOTH BLACK.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.186
THE ONE THAT SHOT ME
WAS TALLER THAN THE OTHER.

12:50.227 --> 12:52.396
LONG-HEADED,
KINDA LIKE SCOTTIE PIPPEN.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.522
ABOUT 17.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.024
HOW'D IT GO DOWN?

12:55.107 --> 12:57.234
WELL, THE SHORTER ONE
ASKED ME FOR THE TIME.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.195
I'M NOT STUPID. I GREW UP
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.863
I KNEW HE WAS GOING
FOR MY MOVIE CAMERA.

13:00.946 --> 13:04.200
SO EVANDER HOLYFIELD
OVER HERE CLOCKS ONE
AND GETS SHOT.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.786
I TOLD 'EM I DIDN'T
HAVE THE TIME.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.288
SO NOW HE'S POINTIN'
AT MY CAMERA.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.165
SO I SWING,
AND I HIT THE SHORT ONE.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.417
AND HIS BUDDY PULLS OUT
THIS POOT-BUTT 25

13:13.501 --> 13:14.794
AND SHOOTS ME
RIGHT IN MY ARM.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.337
AND THEY TOOK OFF
WITH YOUR CAMERA.

13:16.378 --> 13:19.298
YEAH, AND THIS WASN'T
NO CHEESY RENTAL
I GOT FROM THE SCHOOL.

13:19.381 --> 13:20.633
I BOUGHT THIS ONE MYSELF.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.551
IF WE FIND THESE GUYS,
CAN YOU I.D. THEM?

13:22.593 --> 13:24.136
YEAH.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.055
I GOT A GOOD LOOK.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.057
I'LL BE SEEIN' 'EM AGAIN.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.725
Lisette: WOULD YOU PLEASE
STOP IT WITH THAT, ALJUAN?!

13:29.809 --> 13:32.728
ALJUAN, WE FROWN ON
ANY TYPE VIGILANTISM.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.688
JUST 'CAUSE I'M IN COLLEGE,
DON'T MEAN I'M GONNA ACT
LIKE A PUNK

13:34.730 --> 13:35.898
IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.900
YOU KNOW,
HE'S 3 MONTHS
FROM GRADUATION,

13:37.983 --> 13:39.902
AND HE STILL
THINKS HE'S COOL
TALKING LIKE THIS.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.737
DON'T GIVE ME A SPEECH.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.531
ALJUAN, WE'RE GONNA ASK
FOR YOUR COOPERATION.

13:43.572 --> 13:46.408
LET US TAKE IT
FROM HERE.

13:46.450 --> 13:49.912
COULD YOU WRITE DOWN
YOUR ADDRESS
AND PHONE NUMBER?

13:53.082 --> 13:55.251
YEAH.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.460
FINE.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.349
ANDY.

14:10.432 --> 14:11.892
20 MINUTES,
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
AT THE HOSPITAL

14:11.934 --> 14:13.269
TALKING TO THAT JASON.

14:13.310 --> 14:16.063
I'M REREADING MY 5
ON THE INTERVIEW

14:16.105 --> 14:17.606
WITH RICHARDSON'S WIFE.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.068
IT'S A 7,
8-MINUTE DRIVE.

14:21.110 --> 14:24.029
OH, YEAH.
FORTUNATELY, THERE'S
NEVER NO TRAFFIC TIE-UPS

14:24.113 --> 14:25.447
IN THIS PART
OF MANHATTAN.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.575
I DON'T WANT TO HANG
AROUND SOME HOSPITAL
WAITING ROOM.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.828
AHEM. OK.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.497
YEP. HERE WE GO.

15:15.539 --> 15:17.750
NYU STUDENT GOT SHOT
LAST NIGHT DURING A ROBBERY.

15:17.833 --> 15:18.959
JILL AND ME ARE GOING
TO GO CANVASS.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.753
WE'RE GOING BACK
TO LAFAYETTE,

15:20.836 --> 15:22.922
TALK TO THAT JASON.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.214
HE'S BACK
IN THE HOSPITAL, HUH?

15:24.298 --> 15:26.008
YEAH, HE'S
BACK THERE.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.950
[RAP MUSIC PLAYING]

15:55.537 --> 15:56.622
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

15:56.705 --> 15:57.957
GOOD. CAN I HELP YOU?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.959
YEAH. THERE
WAS A SHOOTING

16:00.042 --> 16:01.335
ON THIS STREET
LAST NIGHT.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.920
YEAH, YEAH. I HEARD
IT WAS A COLLEGE KID.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.213
YEAH.
WERE YOU WORKING
LAST NIGHT?

16:04.296 --> 16:05.881
OH, YEAH.
I WAS HERE WORKING.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.384
I'M TRYING TO GET
THIS PLACE ON ITS FEET.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.718
DID YOU
SEE ANYTHING
LAST NIGHT?

16:09.760 --> 16:11.095
NO. NO, NOT REALLY.

16:11.178 --> 16:12.638
DID YOU HEAR
ANYTHING?

16:12.721 --> 16:15.224
BOSS, I'M GOING OUT
FOR SOME COFFEE.
YOU WANT SOMETHING?

16:15.307 --> 16:16.266
NO.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.895
ANYWAY, I'M SAYING
I'M SORRY I CAN'T HELP.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.314
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, SIR?

16:22.398 --> 16:24.650
ROGER GARLAND.
THIS IS MY PLACE.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.360
YOU'RE SAYING
YOU CAN'T HELP US,
MR. GARLAND,

16:26.402 --> 16:27.528
OR YOU WON'T?

16:27.569 --> 16:30.781
LOOK, I JUST OPENED
2 DAYS AGO.

16:30.864 --> 16:32.408
I'M SICK ENOUGH
THIS HAPPENED

16:32.449 --> 16:34.410
WHERE I INVESTED
MY LIFE'S SAVINGS.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.745
LAST THING I NEED
IS TO BE INVOLVED IN
ANY SORT OF DISPUTE.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.957
MR. GARLAND, IF YOU
GENUINELY DON'T HAVE
INFORMATION FOR US,

16:40.040 --> 16:40.958
THAT'S FINE.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.584
BUT IF YOU SAW
SOMETHING,

16:42.626 --> 16:44.503
WE REALLY NEED YOU
TO HELP US.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.509
I HEARD THE SHOT,
I LOOKED OUT,

16:50.592 --> 16:52.594
I SAW THE KID
OUT THERE WOUNDED.
THAT'S IT.

16:52.636 --> 16:53.762
OK.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.347
PLEASE, DON'T--
DON'T USE MY NAME, OK?

16:55.431 --> 16:56.557
DON'T GET ME
INVOLVED HERE.

16:56.598 --> 16:59.518
NO. IF YOU THINK
OF ANYTHING ELSE...

16:59.601 --> 17:00.686
THIS IS WHERE
YOU CAN REACH US.

17:02.062 --> 17:03.439
FINE. THANKS.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.607
GOOD LUCK
WITH YOUR BUSINESS.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.947
YO.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.703
ORLANDO AND DECK.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.121
ORLANDO IS
THE TRIGGERMAN.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.080
YOU SAW THIS?

17:20.122 --> 17:21.248
YOU'LL PROBABLY
FIND THEM

17:21.290 --> 17:23.125
PLAYING VIDEO GAMES
OVER AT, UM...

17:23.167 --> 17:24.626
JOESKI'S BODEGA.

17:24.668 --> 17:26.128
IT'S ABOUT 2 BLOCKS OVER.

17:26.170 --> 17:29.465
UH, ORLANDO, HE'S,
UH, SHORT HAIR, TALL,

17:29.548 --> 17:31.300
HE'S ROCKING
A KARL KANI JACKET.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.802
DECK, HE'S REAL SKINNY.
THEY'RE ALWAYS TOGETHER.

17:33.844 --> 17:36.055
I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'D BE WILLING
TO GIVE A STATEMENT.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.223
LOOK, YOU DON'T NEED
MY STATEMENT, AND I
DON'T NEED TO GET CAPPED.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.434
THE GUY WHO GOT SHOT
COULD PICK THEM
OUT OF A LINEUP.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.603
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.147
I DIDN'T GIVE NO HELP.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.955
HELLO.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.165
COME IN.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.125
HOW'S IT GOING,
JASON?

18:05.167 --> 18:06.877
WELL, I'M BACK IN
THE CARE FACILITY
TEMPORARILY,

18:06.960 --> 18:08.170
AS YOU CAN SEE.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.172
HOW ARE YOU,
DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ?

18:10.255 --> 18:12.966
GOOD, JASON. THE BETTER
FOR SEEING YOU.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.843
WE'VE NAVIGATED
SOME RAPIDS, HAVEN'T WE?

18:14.885 --> 18:17.179
YES, WE HAVE.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.181
OUR KAYAK CAPSIZED
COUPLE OF TIMES.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.182
OH, YEAH.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.184
BUT WE'VE RIGHTED IT
NOW, HAVEN'T WE?

18:22.267 --> 18:23.811
EVERYTHING'S
BACK ABOVEBOARD.

18:23.852 --> 18:25.687
I'LL TELL YOU
WHY WE'VE COME
TO SEE YOU, JASON.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.190
I HOPE IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU'VE
RECONSIDERED MY INNOCENCE.
NO, WE HAVEN'T.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.026
BECAUSE I HAVE SOME
LINGERING SUSPICIONS OF
MY OWN ON THAT SCORE.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.736
THAT'S WHY
I WAS READMITTED.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.988
JASON, WE DO NOT
THINK THAT YOU
KILLED DARLENE.

18:35.030 --> 18:35.989
ALL RIGHT.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.699
SAKE OF DISCUSSION.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.701
WHAT WE NEED
FROM YOU--

18:39.743 --> 18:40.702
FINE. LAY IT OUT.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.496
SHUT UP.

18:44.498 --> 18:45.874
YOU REMEMBER
WE WERE TALKING

18:45.916 --> 18:48.043
ABOUT TOMMY,
DARLENE'S BROTHER?

18:50.337 --> 18:52.047
WE NEED YOU
TO GO OVER FOR US,

18:52.089 --> 18:54.633
IN TERMS OF THIS ONE
CONVERSATION THAT
YOU AND TOMMY HAD,

18:54.716 --> 18:57.052
IF TOMMY
HAD EVER ASKED YOU,

18:57.136 --> 18:59.471
MAYBE, YOUR SCHEDULE
SEEING DARLENE

18:59.555 --> 19:00.973
ON THE DAY THAT
IT TURNED OUT THAT
SHE WAS MURDERED.

19:01.056 --> 19:03.976
SAY, MAYBE,
IF HE ASKED IF YOU
WOULD BE OUT OF TOWN

19:04.059 --> 19:05.561
VISITING
YOUR BROTHER
OR THE LIKE.

19:08.063 --> 19:10.149
SPEAK.
IT'S OK TO SPEAK.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.569
AS FAR AS ASKING
ABOUT MY SCHEDULE,

19:13.610 --> 19:15.571
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
TOMMY DID.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.531
HE DID ASK.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.241
THIS WAS IN
THE OVERALL CONTEXT,

19:19.324 --> 19:21.243
AS I PERCEIVED IT,
OF EXAMINING

19:21.285 --> 19:24.580
THE STATUS OF MY ROMANCE
WITH HIS SISTER,

19:24.621 --> 19:27.499
IF I WAS A SERIOUS
AND RESPONSIBLE SUITOR
FOR DARLENE,

19:27.583 --> 19:30.752
OR WAS I SIMPLY
TAKING HER OUT CABARETING

19:30.794 --> 19:33.088
FOR MY OWN SELFISH MOTIVES,

19:33.130 --> 19:35.215
THESE KINDS OF CONCERNS.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.426
HE'S ASKING,
DID TOMMY ASK
SPECIFICALLY,

19:37.467 --> 19:38.635
WOULD YOU BE
IN TOWN,

19:38.719 --> 19:40.804
WHERE HE CAN KNOW
YOUR WHEREABOUTS?

19:40.888 --> 19:42.306
HE DID, YES.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.099
HE ASKED MY SCHEDULE
AND MY ROUTINE.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.851
DID HE ASK YOU
WHETHER YOU WOULD BE

19:45.934 --> 19:48.353
WITH SOMEONE
WHO COULD ESTABLISH
YOUR WHEREABOUTS?

19:48.437 --> 19:51.273
HE DID ASK IF I USED
AN ESCORT SERVICE,

19:51.315 --> 19:55.068
WHICH I TOOK AGAIN
IN CONTEXT: WAS I
WORTHY AS A SUITOR?

19:55.110 --> 19:56.153
I EXPLAINED

19:56.236 --> 19:57.738
THAT I DIDN'T USE
THOSE SERVICES.

19:57.779 --> 20:00.282
I THINK I CLEARED
THAT HURDLE CLEANLY,

20:00.324 --> 20:02.242
WHEREAS I KNOCKED UP
AGAINST A BARRIER

20:02.284 --> 20:04.703
WHEN HE WAS GOING
THROUGH MY MEDS.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.121
WHAT'S THIS NOW?

20:06.205 --> 20:08.290
TOMMY'S GOING THROUGH
YOUR MEDICATIONS?

20:08.373 --> 20:10.792
DARLENE WAS WORKING

20:10.834 --> 20:13.295
WHEN I ARRIVED FOR
MY MAN-TO-MAN TALK WITH
TOMMY IN HER APARTMENT.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.296
WHEN I ARRIVED,

20:14.379 --> 20:15.881
HE WAS IN THE KITCHEN
OPENING MY CAPSULES.

20:15.964 --> 20:17.466
DARLENE'S
NOT THERE FOR THIS?

20:17.507 --> 20:18.717
NO. DARLENE'S WORKING.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.469
EXACTLY. AND WHEN I
ARRIVED WITH MY OWN KEY,

20:20.552 --> 20:22.638
TOMMY WAS IN THE KITCHEN,

20:22.721 --> 20:24.598
HAVING PULLED APART
SOME OF MY CAPSULES.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.641
HE WAS CONCERNED

20:25.682 --> 20:28.727
I MIGHT HAVE EMPTIED
THE CAPSULES

20:28.810 --> 20:30.312
WAS WHAT TOMMY
EXPLAINED TO ME.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.147
WHEN YOU CAUGHT HIM--

20:32.189 --> 20:34.274
DOES "CATCH HIM"
IMPLY PARANOID DELUSION
ON MY PART?

20:34.316 --> 20:35.484
NO.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.653
BECAUSE I CERTAINLY
WASN'T AWARE OF PROWLING

20:37.694 --> 20:39.821
OR LOOKING FOR TOMMY.
I HAPPENED ON HIM
IN THE KITCHEN.

20:39.863 --> 20:40.989
RIGHT. UNDERSTOOD.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.616
WHEN YOU CATCH HIM,
THEN HE RUNS HIS CRAP

20:42.658 --> 20:45.035
WHY HE WAS EMPTYING
YOUR CAPSULES OUT.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.829
WELL, NOW,
IN FACT, TOMMY THEN
RESTORED THE CONTENTS

20:47.913 --> 20:49.081
TO THE CAPSULES.

20:49.164 --> 20:50.832
COMES UP WITH
HIS COCK-AND-BULL STORY

20:50.874 --> 20:52.793
HE'S MAKING SURE
THAT YOU'RE
TAKING YOUR MEDS,

20:52.834 --> 20:54.169
WHEN HE'S TRYING
TO MAKE YOU WACKY

20:54.253 --> 20:55.963
BEING OFF THEM.

20:56.004 --> 20:57.130
ARE WE GOOD?

20:57.172 --> 20:58.507
I FEEL
THAT YOU ARE.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.092
I TRY TO BE,

21:00.175 --> 21:03.762
BUT...I ONLY
MANAGE IT IN STREAKS.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.297
RICHARDSON DID IT.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.173
WE JUST TALKED
TO THIS JASON

21:40.257 --> 21:41.800
AT THE PUZZLE HOUSE.

21:41.883 --> 21:44.261
HE COMES ON RICHARDSON
ONE DAY GOING THROUGH
HIS PILLS,

21:44.303 --> 21:45.679
EMPTYING OUT
HIS MEDICATION.

21:45.762 --> 21:47.556
NEGLECTED TO
TELL US BEFORE.

21:47.639 --> 21:48.807
AND WE'RE SURE
THAT'S NOT DELUSIONAL?

21:48.849 --> 21:51.351
HE WASN'T DELUSIONAL
RIGHT NOW, THIS GUY.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.020
I WOULDN'T SAY
HE WAS EXACTLY SANE.

21:53.103 --> 21:56.064
HE WASN'T EVEN LOOKING
TO TELL US THIS.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.816
WE, UM...

21:57.858 --> 22:00.152
WE GOT TO GO
AT RICHARDSON.

22:00.193 --> 22:03.238
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO
DO ABOUT MIKE SHANNON?

22:03.322 --> 22:04.448
RICHARDSON TALKED
TO US WITHOUT
HIS DELEGATE

22:04.489 --> 22:06.074
THIS MORNING.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.326
THAT'S HIM
LOOKING FOR YOU.

22:07.367 --> 22:08.493
WE GOT TO NOTIFY
MIKE, ANDY.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.246
YEAH.
LET'S NOTIFY MIKE.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.290
IS THAT
MY WIFE'S OVERCOAT
OUT THERE?

22:13.332 --> 22:15.917
RUSSELL AND KIRKENDALL
GRABBED UP 2 SUSPECTS

22:16.001 --> 22:18.086
IN THE SHOOTING CAME IN
OFF THAT CAMERA ROBBERY.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.504
SYLVIA'S RUNNING A LINEUP.

22:19.546 --> 22:21.506
SEEM LIKE SHE'S
STILL GOT HER CHOPS?

22:21.548 --> 22:23.383
SHE KNEW
WHICH ROOM TO GO TO.

22:24.926 --> 22:27.304
SHE DIDN'T WANT NO
FANFARE COMING BACK.

22:34.102 --> 22:36.646
YOU CAN SEE IN, ALJUAN.
THEY CAN'T SEE OUT.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.148
YOU SEE ANYONE
YOU RECOGNIZE,

22:38.190 --> 22:41.526
YOU SAY THEIR NUMBER
AND WHERE YOU
KNOW THEM FROM.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.028
I NEED TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

22:43.111 --> 22:44.029
OK.

22:44.112 --> 22:45.530
I I.D. THESE GUYS,

22:45.614 --> 22:47.032
ARE THEY GOING TO BE
BACK ON THE STREETS

22:47.115 --> 22:48.617
WHILE THEY'RE WAITING
FOR THEIR TRIAL?

22:48.700 --> 22:50.035
I DOUBT
THEY CAN MAKE BAIL.

22:50.118 --> 22:51.703
SO THEY WON'T
EVEN SEE THE
STREETS AGAIN

22:51.745 --> 22:52.913
TILL THEY SERVE
THEIR TIME?

22:52.996 --> 22:55.123
THAT'S RIGHT.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.626
ARE YOU WORRIED
FOR YOUR SAFETY,
ALJUAN?

22:57.709 --> 22:58.710
NO.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.422
YOU READY TO LOOK
AT THE LINEUP?

23:02.506 --> 23:04.383
NO. MAYBE I
AIN'T INTERESTED

23:04.466 --> 23:05.884
IN DOING THIS
AFTER ALL.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.469
YOU WANT TO BREAK BAD
WITH THESE GUYS
YOURSELF, ALJUAN?

23:07.552 --> 23:09.388
FOLLOW THEM WHEN
WE CUT THEM LOOSE?

23:09.471 --> 23:11.890
THESE LITTLE ASSHOLES
WERE READY TO KILL ME
FOR THAT CAMERA.

23:11.932 --> 23:14.768
ALJUAN, THESE GUYS WALK,
A LITTLE LATER SOMETHING
HAPPENS TO THEM,

23:14.851 --> 23:17.229
WHO WE GOING TO COME
LOOKING FOR?

23:17.270 --> 23:19.481
YOU WANT TO BE
ON THAT SIDE
OF THE WINDOW?

23:19.564 --> 23:20.941
Y'ALL DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

23:21.024 --> 23:22.401
NO. WHAT I DON'T
UNDERSTAND

23:22.484 --> 23:24.194
IS WHY YOU'D JEOPARDIZE
ALL YOU'VE GOT,

23:24.236 --> 23:26.571
COLLEGE DEGREE,
GIRLFRIEND, YOUR WHOLE
LIFE AHEAD OF YOU,

23:26.613 --> 23:28.990
FOR YOUR IDEA
OF GETTING EVEN
WITH THESE PUNKS?

23:29.074 --> 23:31.034
YOU SOUND
JUST LIKE LISETTE.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.620
LISETTE SOUNDS
LIKE A SMART
GIRL.

23:35.122 --> 23:36.456
COME ON, ALJUAN,

23:36.540 --> 23:39.209
EVERYTHING
YOU'VE WORKED FOR.
DON'T SCREW YOURSELF UP.

23:41.044 --> 23:42.295
FINE.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.797
I'LL PICK
THEIR ASSES OUT.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.298
GOOD.

23:45.382 --> 23:46.633
YEAH, I'LL NAIL THEM
THIS WAY.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.182
NUMBER 2.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.143
THAT'S THE SON OF A BITCH
THAT SHOT ME.

23:56.226 --> 23:59.312
HOLD 2. SET UP
THE NEXT GROUP.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.280
HELLO.

24:08.321 --> 24:09.322
WHAT'S UP?

24:09.406 --> 24:10.866
I'M JOHN IRVINE.

24:10.949 --> 24:13.118
I WAS A CIVILIAN
AIDE IN THIS
STATION HOUSE ALSO.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.036
ARE THEY HAVING
A REUNION?

24:15.120 --> 24:16.455
OH, I'D LOVE IT
IF THEY DID.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.457
BUT ACTUALLY, I'M
JUST STOPPING BY.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.084
I STARTED A COMPUTER
GRAPHICS BUSINESS
2 BLOCKS OVER,

24:21.126 --> 24:22.335
AND I'M JUST BEING
VERY FORWARD

24:22.419 --> 24:24.671
AND LEAVING THE
ANNOUNCEMENTS WITH
EVERYONE I KNOW.

24:24.754 --> 24:26.965
ALL THE DETECTIVES
ARE ELSEWHERE.

24:27.007 --> 24:29.009
I SEE. UH...

24:29.092 --> 24:30.552
ALTHOUGH
LIEUTENANT FANCY'S

HI!

24:37.309 --> 24:40.145
OLD FRIENDS.

24:40.187 --> 24:41.521
COULD I
IMPOSE ON YOU

24:41.605 --> 24:42.898
TO GIVE THESE OUT?

24:42.981 --> 24:44.149
SURE.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.859
I HAD SUCH
A WONDERFUL TIME
WORKING HERE.

24:45.942 --> 24:47.486
I EVEN CUT
THE DETECTIVES'
HAIR.

24:47.527 --> 24:49.821
THAT FAT ONE'S
PRETTY BALD.

24:49.863 --> 24:51.573
I THINK I ACTUALLY

24:51.656 --> 24:55.076
DID A LITTLE
SOMETHING FOR HIM.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.495
WELL...

24:56.578 --> 24:57.871
I HOPE OUR PATHS
WILL CROSS.

24:57.954 --> 25:00.207
YEAH.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.334
I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG I'M HERE...

OF THING YOU DO?

25:11.259 --> 25:14.679
I COULD. SURE.

GOOD-LOOKING ONE.

25:27.859 --> 25:30.362

BOTH THOSE KIDS, LIEU.
ONE LAWYERED UP.

25:44.876 --> 25:45.961

25:46.044 --> 25:48.380
ORLANDO, THE OTHER ONE,
IS BACK IN THE POKEY.

25:48.463 --> 25:50.882
SO, HOW'D THE ONE
KNOW TO LAWYER UP? DID
HE HAVE A CASE PENDING?

25:50.924 --> 25:52.300
HAD HIS LAWYER'S CARD
WITH HIM.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.718
WE'LL GET
THIS ORLANDO'S SHEET

25:53.802 --> 25:55.637
AND THEN GO HAVE A CHAT.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.347
SYLVIA WAS RIDING D.A.

26:02.894 --> 26:05.605

26:12.571 --> 26:14.447
WE WANT A SIT-DOWN
WITH RICHARDSON.

26:14.531 --> 26:17.742
WELL, YOU HAD YOUR SIT-DOWN
THIS MORNING WHILE I'M
GETTING FITTED FOR GLASSES.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.160

26:23.873 --> 26:26.835
MIKE, ANDY'S GOT TO MAKE IT
UP THE STAIRS TO GO TO WORK.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.628
RICHARDSON PULLS ME
INTO THE RADIO ROOM.

26:28.712 --> 26:31.214
BECAUSE HE'S WORRIED SICK
ON HOW YOU GUYS WERE GOING
TO TALK TO HIS WIFE.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.925
WE DIDN'T JAM UP
RICHARDSON WITH HIS WIFE
THIS MUCH, MIKE.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.595
ASK HIM HOW BAD
HE SCARED HER
OUT OF HER WITS

26:36.678 --> 26:38.221
GETTING HER READY

26:38.263 --> 26:40.807

26:49.232 --> 26:51.735
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
TOO FAR IN FRONT ON THIS.

26:53.069 --> 26:55.614
HOW SOON
CAN YOU GET US TOMMY?

26:55.655 --> 26:57.449
HE'S ON PATROL.

26:57.532 --> 26:59.826

27:17.677 --> 27:19.095
HI.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.555

27:20.639 --> 27:22.682

27:22.766 --> 27:23.850

27:23.933 --> 27:26.061
HOW'D YOU CONDUCT

27:26.144 --> 27:27.646

ANY REVERSIBLE ERRORS.

27:31.858 --> 27:33.234

27:48.500 --> 27:50.001
WELL, YOU KNOW,

27:50.043 --> 27:51.836
THEY JUST HAD LUNCH,

27:51.878 --> 27:53.338

28:29.666 --> 28:32.419
YOU KNOW WHAT
"HEARSAY" IS?

28:34.379 --> 28:37.215
JUST BECAUSE YOU HEAR
SOMETHING SOMEBODY SAY,

28:37.257 --> 28:39.217
DON'T MAKE IT TRUE.

28:39.259 --> 28:40.218
INTERESTING.

28:40.301 --> 28:41.553
ORLANDO, YOU AND
YOUR BUDDY DECK

FOR THIS SHOOTING.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.431

29:24.429 --> 29:26.097
HE'S WHO'S GOT
THE MOVIE CAMERA.

29:26.181 --> 29:27.390

29:27.432 --> 29:29.809
I SEEN HIM WITH IT.
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE HE STAYS.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.853

WAS IT YOU OR DECK?

29:36.775 --> 29:38.443

29:41.446 --> 29:42.822
VANGIE HOLDIN'
THAT CAMERA,

29:42.906 --> 29:44.574
I GUESS HE'S 9/10
GUILTY OF THE SHOOTING.

29:44.616 --> 29:48.286
HMM. THAT WHY YOU
TURNED DOWN HAVING

30:43.675 --> 30:46.719

30:46.803 --> 30:49.013
I'M SO GLAD HE DECIDED
TO CALL Y'ALL.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.182
I DIDN'T CALL
NO POLICE.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.559
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

30:52.642 --> 30:55.270

OH, MY GOD.

31:00.650 --> 31:01.985
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

31:02.026 --> 31:06.447
MY SON WOULD
NEVER BE MIXED UP
IN NO MESS LIKE THAT.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.909
HE IS THE VICTIM OF A CRIME.
LOOK AT HIM!

31:09.993 --> 31:11.327
WHAT HAPPENED?

31:11.369 --> 31:12.579
I FELL.

31:12.662 --> 31:14.914
YOU KNOW THAT'S
NOT THE TRUTH, VANGIE.

31:16.624 --> 31:18.918
HE WON'T TELL ME
WHO DID THIS TO HIM.

31:20.211 --> 31:22.088
DO YOU MIND IF WE HAVE
A LOOK IN VANGIE'S ROOM?

31:23.840 --> 31:26.301
OF COURSE NOT.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.219
WE AIN'T GOT
NOTHIN' TO HIDE.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.201
WAIT A MINUTE.

32:12.597 --> 32:15.475
MA'AM, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO GET THE OTHER THING OUT.

32:20.021 --> 32:21.940
VANGIE, WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT GUN?

32:22.023 --> 32:24.984
MOM, I DIDN'T STEAL IT,
AND I DIDN'T SHOOT NOBODY.

32:28.780 --> 32:29.906
WHAT HAPPENED,
VANGIE?

32:29.948 --> 32:32.617
A BOY AT SCHOOL
MADE ME TAKE IT.

32:32.659 --> 32:35.495
HE HIT YOU
TO MAKE YOU DO THAT?

32:35.578 --> 32:38.456
I NEVER TOUCHED THE GUN
'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO
GET MY FINGERPRINTS ON IT.

32:40.124 --> 32:44.003
I STARTED FOOLING AROUND
WITH THE CAMERA SOME.

32:44.087 --> 32:47.590
I THOUGHT WHILE
I WAS HOLDING IT,

32:47.632 --> 32:50.301
I COULD MAKE
A LITTLE MOVIE.

32:50.385 --> 32:53.054
WHO MADE YOU HOLD
THE GUN AND THE CAMERA,
VANGIE?

32:54.222 --> 32:56.891
THIS GUY NAMED
ORLANDO PATTERSON.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.060
NOW HE'S GONNA
BEAT ME UP AGAIN
FOR TELLING ON HIM.

32:59.143 --> 33:01.062
NO, HE'S NOT.

33:02.188 --> 33:04.148
VANGIE'S GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT.

33:18.579 --> 33:21.124
NO MORE COFFEE ROOM, HUH?
GLOVES COMING OFF?

33:22.500 --> 33:25.169
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED, TOMMY.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.172
UH-HUH.

33:28.214 --> 33:30.091
FIRST OFF,
NO ONE IN THIS ROOM

33:30.174 --> 33:32.260
FEELS WHAT HAPPENED TO
THAT GIRL WAS INTENTIONAL.

33:32.343 --> 33:34.595
NOBODY IN THIS ROOM?
THEY SPEAKING
FOR YOU NOW?

33:34.679 --> 33:36.180
YOU KNOW THEY'RE
NOT SPEAKING FOR ME.

33:36.264 --> 33:39.350
FOR A GUY TORN UP
HIS HIGH SCHOOL
SWEETHEART GOT MURDERED,

33:39.392 --> 33:41.269
YOU'RE SOUNDING PRETTY
JAUNTY, RICHARDSON.

33:41.352 --> 33:43.479
I GOT NO ROOM FOR
MY THOUGHTS ON DARLENE.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.481
I'M BUSY WATCHING YOU GUYS
MESS WITH MY LIFE.

33:45.523 --> 33:48.192
WE'RE TRYING TO
ADDRESS THE SITUATION
IN FRONT OF US HERE.

33:48.234 --> 33:49.569
NO ONE'S LOOKING
TO MESS UP YOUR LIFE.

33:49.652 --> 33:51.821
SO THAT WASN'T YOU GUYS
PUSHING LAURIE AROUND?

33:51.863 --> 33:53.698
IS THAT WHAT SHE SAID?
WE PUSHED HER AROUND?

33:53.740 --> 33:56.034
NO, 'CAUSE SHE'S
TOO SWEET TO KNOW THAT'S
WHAT YOU GUYS WERE DOING.

33:56.075 --> 33:58.411
SHE TOO SWEET TO KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE DOING?

33:59.746 --> 34:01.539
TELL THEM TO ASK
WHAT THEY WANT TO ASK.

34:01.581 --> 34:04.792
WE'RE NOT ASKING NOTHIN',
AND HE'S PLAYING YOU TOO EASY.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.252
WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

34:06.335 --> 34:07.211
IS THAT RIGHT?

34:07.253 --> 34:09.380
BECAUSE HE LEADS ME
AROUND BY THE NOSE,

34:09.422 --> 34:12.800
WE GAVE YOU A CHANCE
TO COME FORWARD INSTEAD
OF HUMILIATING YOU,

34:12.884 --> 34:15.553
WHICH, BELIEVE ME,
IS HOW I WOULD GO.

34:15.595 --> 34:17.055
I BEEN ON THE JOB
10 YEARS,

34:17.096 --> 34:18.222
THEY'RE GONNA TRY
THIS GAME WITH ME?

34:18.264 --> 34:20.558
HE THINKS WE'RE
RUNNING A GAME.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.727
WE KNOW ABOUT YOU FRAMING
THAT MENTAL PATIENT.

34:22.769 --> 34:24.562
WE KNOW YOU LOOKED
TO EMPTY HIS PILLS,

34:24.604 --> 34:26.230
YOU LOOKED
TO ESTABLISH
HIS WHEREABOUTS

34:26.314 --> 34:27.774
WHEN HE WOULDN'T
HAVE AN ALIBI.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.692
WE KNOW THE WHOLE
DAMN THING.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.944
I WENT THROUGH THE GUY'S
MEDICATION, SO WHAT?

34:32.028 --> 34:35.156
A GIRL YOU CARE ABOUT IS
DATING SOME HALF-A-NUT JOB,

34:35.239 --> 34:39.368
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE WORRIED
HE'S TAKING HIS MEDS?

34:39.410 --> 34:41.996
ASKED HIM
WHERE HE'S GOING TO BE.
THERE'S A CAPITAL OFFENSE.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.498
WE'RE TRYING TO GET YOU
TO SEE, TOMMY,

34:43.581 --> 34:46.292
THE WINDOW IS CLOSING.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.336
LET IT CLOSE, <i>BOBBY.</i>

34:48.419 --> 34:51.631
YOU GOT A MURDER WEAPON
WITH MY PRINTS ON IT?

34:51.714 --> 34:53.841
YOU GOT A MURDER WEAPON
AT ALL?

34:55.134 --> 34:56.719
YOU GOT THIS!

34:56.761 --> 34:59.430
HE DON'T ACT
LIKE HE DID IT,
DOES HE, MIKE?

34:59.472 --> 35:00.932
YOU DONE HERE?

35:00.973 --> 35:02.892
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

35:31.045 --> 35:33.256
YOU GOT
NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.

35:33.297 --> 35:35.258
RICHARDSON'S STONEWALLED.

35:35.299 --> 35:37.093
SEEMS LIKE YOUR ONLY MOVE
IS BACK AT THE WIFE.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.721
WE CAN'T BE SURE
HOW MUCH SHE KNOWS.

35:40.763 --> 35:44.308
TURN THE CARD OVER,
RICHARDSON WAS HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH THE D.O.A.,

35:44.392 --> 35:46.018
MAYBE YOU SHAKE
SOMETHING LOOSE.

35:46.102 --> 35:49.230
THE TRUTH IS, WE'RE
NOWHERE NEAR BEING ABLE
TO MAKE NO CASE.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.648
ALL SHE COULD GIVE YOU
TO MAKE ONE

35:50.731 --> 35:52.358
IS A DIRECT STATEMENT
FROM RICHARDSON

35:52.400 --> 35:53.776
THAT HE DID IT OR SOMETHING
ABOUT THE WEAPON.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.778
NO WAY HE CONFESSED IT
TO HER,

35:55.862 --> 35:57.613
AND THAT KNIFE IS
SOMEWHERE IN THE WATER.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.073
HE'S NOT GONNA
HIDE NO KNIFE.

36:02.326 --> 36:05.079
IF WE'RE NOT GONNA BE
ABLE TO MAKE A CASE,

36:05.121 --> 36:07.874
WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO
TO LET THE WIFE AND KID
KNOW WHAT A BUM THIS GUY IS?

36:13.921 --> 36:15.673
[SIGHS]

36:28.936 --> 36:30.146
WHAT'S THAT?

36:30.188 --> 36:32.315
WHAT'S THAT?
YOUR ASS.

36:32.398 --> 36:33.232
YEAH, RIGHT.

36:33.316 --> 36:36.986
THIS IS THE GUN
THAT SHOT ALJUAN RAYFORD.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.446
GOT YOUR PRINTS ON IT.

36:38.529 --> 36:39.655
MY FINGERPRINTS?

36:39.697 --> 36:40.531
YEP.

36:40.615 --> 36:41.532
JUST MINE?

36:41.616 --> 36:45.536
YEP.
LAB CHECKED IT TWICE.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.121
HERE'S WHERE YOU ARE,
ORLANDO.

36:47.163 --> 36:49.290
THE GUNSHOT VICTIM
PICKED YOU OUT,

36:49.332 --> 36:51.792
YOU TOLD US WHERE
TO FIND THE CAMERA

36:51.834 --> 36:54.503
WITH SOME INNOCENT KID
YOU BEAT UP AND THREATENED.

36:54.545 --> 36:55.838
I DIDN'T BEAT UP
NOBODY.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.298
WHILE WE'RE THERE
GETTING THE CAMERA,

36:57.340 --> 36:59.133
WE FIND THE GUN YOU USED
IN THE SHOOTING

36:59.175 --> 37:01.135
WITH YOUR GREASY PRINTS
ALL OVER IT.

37:01.177 --> 37:04.597
ORLANDO, THANK GOD,
THE GUY YOU SHOT
WASN'T HURT TOO BADLY.

37:04.680 --> 37:07.183
WRITE UP WHAT YOU DID
AND SHOW SOME REMORSE

37:07.266 --> 37:09.852
AND MAYBE WE CAN KEEP THIS
FROM BEING TOO MAJOR.

37:09.936 --> 37:11.270
I AIN'T
GOTTA DO THAT.

37:11.312 --> 37:12.480
I COULD JUST
SHUT THE HELL UP.

37:12.521 --> 37:14.649
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S THE 20-YEAR PLAN.

37:14.690 --> 37:18.152
YOU'LL GET OUT IN TIME
TO BE FITTED FOR DENTURES.

37:18.194 --> 37:20.529
THE PLAN WAS
TO JACK ALJUAN,

37:20.571 --> 37:21.822
GET SOME CHANGE
FOR HIS CAMERA.

37:21.864 --> 37:23.783
HE PUTS UP A FIGHT,
STARTS HITTING US.

37:23.866 --> 37:25.284
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED
TO DO, HUH?

37:25.368 --> 37:26.619
LET HIM TAKE MY GUN?

37:26.702 --> 37:28.537
WRITE THAT DOWN, ORLANDO.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.706
LET'S GET THE BALL ROLLING
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

37:33.209 --> 37:35.795
YOU KNOW WHAT I GOT
REMORSE ABOUT?

37:35.878 --> 37:37.296
LETTING DECK
TALK ME INTO TAKING

37:37.380 --> 37:39.298
THAT BUS TRIP DOWN
TO ATLANTIC CITY.

37:39.382 --> 37:42.093
I LOST ALL MY LOOT
SHOOTING CRAPS.

37:42.176 --> 37:44.178
NEW MILLENNIUM'S
LOOKING GREAT.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.013
HUH.

37:56.315 --> 37:59.026
"YOU GOT THIS."

38:08.244 --> 38:11.831
LITTLE TIME GOES BY,
HE LETS HIS GUARD DOWN...

38:11.914 --> 38:13.916
MAYBE MAKE A MISTAKE.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.547
GIVE ME A COUPLE
OF MINUTES START.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.010
EXCUSE ME, ANDY.

38:24.093 --> 38:25.803
HEY, GREG. WHAT
HAPPENED WITH ABBY?

38:25.886 --> 38:28.556
FALSE ALARM.

38:31.350 --> 38:33.394
YOU GOT ANY JUICE
IN TARRYTOWN?

38:33.436 --> 38:34.895
KNOW ANY COPS?

38:36.772 --> 38:38.316
I GOTTA GET MY COAT.

38:47.491 --> 38:51.120
TOOK A MOVING-VIOLATION
COLLAR NEAR TARRYTOWN.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.249
WAS THAT YOU ON PATROL

38:55.291 --> 38:57.585
TRANSMITTING SALACIOUS
MESSAGES AROUND 3:00?

38:57.668 --> 38:58.878
WASN'T ME.

38:58.961 --> 39:00.546
'CAUSE IT SOUNDED TO ME
LIKE YOUR VOICE.

39:00.629 --> 39:01.881
EXCUSE US.

39:01.964 --> 39:03.341
SURE.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.637
YOU ALREADY AUDITIONING
FOR YOUR SECOND-STRING BANG?

39:08.679 --> 39:10.723
IF THIS IS A CONVERSATION,
I WANT MIKE SHANNON.

39:10.806 --> 39:13.225
NO. THIS IS
A MESSAGE DELIVERY.

39:13.309 --> 39:16.812
YOU'D NEED THE KIND OF
DEEP ROOTS IN THIS HOUSE

39:16.896 --> 39:18.731
AN ASSHOLE LIKE YOU
DON'T DEVELOP

39:18.814 --> 39:21.108
NOT TO DO A LOT BETTER
PUTTING IN FOR TRANSFER.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.860
WHY WOULD THAT BE,
SIPOWICZ?

39:22.943 --> 39:25.446
'CAUSE YOUR HALF A CHANCE
OF BEATING THIS GOES DOWN
VERY CONSIDERABLE
