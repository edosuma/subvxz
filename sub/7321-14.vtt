WEBVTT

00:07.607 --> 00:08.733
Come on.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.269
Come on, come on...

00:12.312 --> 00:14.246
Ow! Damn it.

00:15.348 --> 00:18.909
<i>Any first year med student</i>
<i>knows that an increased heart rate</i>

00:18.952 --> 00:20.852
<i>is a sign of trouble.</i>

00:22.922 --> 00:25.152
- All day of this.
- Stuck with Stevens.

00:25.191 --> 00:28.592
Why are we in a clinic? I thought
we're supposed to be surgeons.

00:28.628 --> 00:32.119
Not today we're not.
Today's gonna be about flu shots.

00:32.165 --> 00:35.362
- And enemas.
- What a colossal waste of time.

00:36.569 --> 00:38.036
Morning.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.665
<i>A racing heart</i>
<i>could indicate anything...</i>

00:42.208 --> 00:44.802
<i>...from a panic disorder...</i>

00:44.844 --> 00:46.744
- Oh, God! Sorry!
- No, I'm sorry.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.681
I... No, I didn't even look, I'm sorry.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.446
Where...? No, no.
I'll leave. I'll leave.

00:52.485 --> 00:55.818
No. Sleep.
You've been here all night.

00:57.090 --> 01:00.719
Uh... How did you know
I've been here all night?

01:02.128 --> 01:04.721
<i>...to something much...</i>

01:04.763 --> 01:06.561
I just knew.

01:06.599 --> 01:10.330
<i>...much more serious.</i>

01:15.475 --> 01:19.241
You should
wear your hair up more.

01:19.279 --> 01:21.645
Shows off the back of your neck.

01:23.316 --> 01:25.477
I like the back of your neck.

01:38.665 --> 01:40.724
<i>A heart that flutters...</i>

01:42.202 --> 01:44.500
<i>...or one that skips a beat...</i>

01:44.537 --> 01:46.732
Hey. I thought you were sleeping.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.970
- Hunt was in the on-call room.
- You had dirty sex with Hunt?

01:50.009 --> 01:53.672
No. It's not dirty
and it's not sex. It's...

01:53.713 --> 01:57.171
- I don't know what it is.
- <i>...could be sign of secret affliction.</i>

01:57.217 --> 02:00.550
- Hey, how's it going?
- Oh, my God. Thank you for asking.

02:00.587 --> 02:03.579
It's great. I mean,
he's fun and funny.

02:03.623 --> 02:06.057
Even with no sex allowed,
we just laugh.

02:06.092 --> 02:08.686
- We talk...
- Yeah. I don't want to hear this.

02:08.728 --> 02:11.629
Come on! But you have to!
You're the only one who knows.

02:11.664 --> 02:14.531
I'm terrible at keeping secrets.
It makes me sick.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.660
Alone people don't like to hear
about together people.

02:16.703 --> 02:19.467
Even if alone people
are alone by choice. It's mean.

02:19.506 --> 02:23.067
It's like bringing a six pack to
an AA meeting. Keep it to yourself.

02:24.377 --> 02:26.368
I am.

02:26.412 --> 02:30.007
I need a favor. My mother's ninth
journal. I need you to pre-read it.

02:30.049 --> 02:31.516
- Why?
- She had an affair with the chief.

02:31.551 --> 02:34.247
Your mother had an affair
with her chief resident?

02:34.287 --> 02:37.154
- Rock on, Ellis.
- No, no, no. Not her chief.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.055
Our chief.

02:40.493 --> 02:42.222
Yeah, you'll go blind reading that.

02:42.262 --> 02:45.163
<i>Or it could</i>
<i>indicate romance...</i>

02:47.100 --> 02:49.227
<i>...which is the biggest trouble of all.</i>

02:49.269 --> 02:51.829
- Whoa. What is that?
- What you think it is.

02:51.871 --> 02:54.840
Dangerous. People who carry guns
are likely to fire.

02:54.874 --> 02:58.139
I'm ready to fire it. She's the problem.
She spooks easy.

02:58.178 --> 03:03.013
I have to fire at the right time, in
the right way, or she'll panic and bolt.

03:03.049 --> 03:06.849
- She's not ready. Think she's ready?
- I don't know. More importantly,

03:06.886 --> 03:09.013
if you don't know,
don't do anything.

03:09.055 --> 03:11.683
- Dr. Sloan.
- Dr. Hunt.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.494
Let's make this quick.

03:21.601 --> 03:24.866
- So we're good to go?
- Yep. Use it wisely.

03:27.106 --> 03:28.733
Hey. I'm with you today.

03:28.775 --> 03:32.233
- What's going on with you and Mark?
- What? Nothing.

03:32.278 --> 03:34.405
Why? What did you think is... was?

03:34.447 --> 03:36.972
You've been on his service
for over a week.

03:37.016 --> 03:41.316
Yeah, I'm really interested in Plastics.
As a specialty. Fascinated.

03:41.354 --> 03:44.414
- I like faces.
- Mmm-hmm.

03:45.024 --> 03:49.085
Vehicular blunt trauma,
right shoulder stabilized in the field.

03:49.128 --> 03:52.427
- Somebody help us! Please!
- Jen, slow down. We're here.

03:52.465 --> 03:55.525
Can you help my husband?
I ran him over with the car!

03:55.568 --> 03:58.366
Sweetie, sweetie.
You have to calm down.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.838
- I'm gonna be fine.
- OK. I'm calm. I'm calm.

04:00.873 --> 04:03.569
- All right.
- I'm calm.

04:08.548 --> 04:12.006
Oh, my God.
That's my stupid pregnant brain!

04:12.051 --> 04:15.350
I left the car in drive.
Baby, I'm so sorry.

04:15.388 --> 04:18.516
- It's a normal neuro exam.
- He's got an inferior

04:18.558 --> 04:21.959
shoulder dislocation and fractures.
You'll need surgery.

04:21.995 --> 04:25.624
- Sloan will dÃ©bride burns in surgery.
- Surgery? Oh, baby!

04:25.665 --> 04:29.533
- Her BP is 170 over 100.
- Give her five of hydralazine.

04:29.569 --> 04:33.300
- Calm down. How's the baby?
- Kicking. Pressing right on my bladder.

04:33.339 --> 04:36.570
Look on the bright side. She's not
running you over with a truck.

04:36.609 --> 04:40.204
Hey,
you wanted the SUV, right?

04:40.246 --> 04:42.407
Pregnancy-induced hypertension?

04:42.448 --> 04:43.506
Get her BP down before

04:43.549 --> 04:46.746
- it affects the baby.
- Nice couple. They'll have cute kids.

04:46.786 --> 04:50.313
Not as cute as ours, but cute.

04:51.824 --> 04:54.554
- What?
- Nothing.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.065
It's been three days.
Three days of vacation.

05:04.103 --> 05:07.129
The only days I've taken,
other than my maternity leave.

05:07.173 --> 05:10.074
- I know I'm behind, but...
- Bailey, I get it.

05:10.109 --> 05:12.907
Jackson Prescott was not an easy case.

05:12.945 --> 05:17.348
Frankly, sir, I would rather not
work on another dying kid again.

05:17.383 --> 05:20.477
But no need to worry.
I will catch up and I...

05:20.520 --> 05:24.479
I'm not worrying. I'm promoting you.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.924
I need another attending
in General Surgery.

05:26.959 --> 05:29.689
I'm submitting to the board
that it be you.

05:29.729 --> 05:33.062
And that it starts this July.

05:33.099 --> 05:35.567
The minute you've
completed your residency.

05:35.601 --> 05:39.002
I know there was some talk
a while back

05:39.038 --> 05:42.940
about you getting tired
of appies and gall bladders...

05:42.975 --> 05:47.036
A full roster of appies and
gall bladders sounds just perfect.

05:47.080 --> 05:50.982
All right. But not today, though.
Dixon's requested you on her service.

05:51.017 --> 05:54.748
This is subject to board approval,
Bailey, though I'm not worried.

05:54.787 --> 05:57.312
You have less to say now, huh?

06:00.093 --> 06:01.788
Get out of here.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.196
Dr. Dixon is not big on eye contact,

06:07.233 --> 06:09.793
so don't be surprised
if she doesn't look at you.

06:09.836 --> 06:13.602
Also, try to avoid physical contact,
loud or disruptive noises.

06:13.639 --> 06:16.267
- She's OK? She's a good doctor?
- She's amazing.

06:16.309 --> 06:20.541
You couldn't ask for a better surgeon.
I'm telling you so you'll be prepared.

06:20.580 --> 06:23.640
Dr. Dixon, Dr. Bailey,
this is Dan and Lisa Pollock.

06:23.683 --> 06:26.709
I need to see the patient.
Where's the patient?

06:29.856 --> 06:30.880
Hi.

06:30.923 --> 06:32.720
Stacy Pollock, age nine.

06:32.759 --> 06:35.922
She's suffering from
pulmonary hypertension due to a VSD.

06:35.962 --> 06:40.228
Her EKG also shows a left
ventricular hypertrophy, also...

06:41.734 --> 06:44.294
- Hi. Can I help you folks?
- Not him.

06:46.272 --> 06:48.433
- What's the trouble?
- Not him either.

06:48.474 --> 06:49.839
Thank you. We'll wait.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.538
What about him? Hello.
Could you help us, please?

06:53.579 --> 06:56.844
- We need to talk to a grownup.
- This is the chief of surgery.

06:56.883 --> 07:00.512
Just hold on. That doesn't mean
I'm not a doctor. How can we help?

07:00.553 --> 07:03.078
- My husband...
- Our children went to college.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.590
One's at Stanford,
the other at U-Dub.

07:05.625 --> 07:09.288
We tried something... a new thing.

07:09.328 --> 07:13.059
- Something slipped and we lost...
- Rachel.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.466
We were reading this thing
in a magazine...

07:16.502 --> 07:18.197
Here.

07:22.842 --> 07:25.834
"Twenty Techniques
to Re-Ignite Your Nights."

07:25.878 --> 07:28.278
We did Number Nine.

07:32.452 --> 07:37.116
- Um... Let's get you in a gown...
- No. He did Number Nine.

07:37.156 --> 07:40.853
- We did Number Nine.
- I'm not the one with it stuck in my...

07:40.893 --> 07:43.225
It's him. He's the patient.

07:44.430 --> 07:48.696
Um... Have a seat.
We'll... take care of you.

07:49.235 --> 07:52.727
Uh... I'll stand.

07:57.844 --> 08:00.540
- Taking him now? For surgery?
- It's a good thing.

08:00.580 --> 08:04.243
We'll get his dislocation fixed so
we prevent problems with circulation.

08:04.283 --> 08:06.478
162 over 102.

08:06.519 --> 08:09.044
The OB was worried
about placental blood flow.

08:09.088 --> 08:11.579
Stay with her.
Try to keep her calm.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.285
- OK.
- Cheeseburgers and...

08:14.527 --> 08:17.894
- Painkillers are working.
- Anything else I can get you?

08:17.930 --> 08:20.660
I'm OK. Are you really taking him now?

08:20.700 --> 08:21.792
Yeah.

08:23.069 --> 08:27.631
Hmm, Cheeseburgers... Cheeseburgers.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.572
She's more relaxed when she eats.

08:31.611 --> 08:35.068
- Cheeseburgers calm her down.
- Thanks for the tip.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.784
Stacy has a VSD,
which has gotten worse over time

08:40.820 --> 08:42.981
and created pulmonary hypertension.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.354
- Does she need surgery?
- Are you OK?

08:45.391 --> 08:49.794
That child looks like she's gonna die,
I am walking out.

08:49.829 --> 08:53.822
I'll perform a transcatheter closure
to repair the defect in the septum.

08:53.866 --> 08:57.097
That baby doesn't understand
a word she's saying.

08:57.937 --> 09:02.840
Uh, she says we're gonna fix the part
of your heart that pumps the blood

09:02.875 --> 09:06.106
- to your lungs.
- A simple patch repair.

09:06.145 --> 09:10.172
- Probably something easy to fix.
- A midline sternotomy incision

09:10.216 --> 09:13.515
- may be required.
- Now she's making stuff up.

09:14.754 --> 09:18.451
- I like your socks.
- Thanks. They're for soccer.

09:18.491 --> 09:21.551
I'm the best on my team.
Mom says that's bragging.

09:21.594 --> 09:24.427
Dad says it's not, it's just the truth.

09:24.463 --> 09:28.399
You can't fight who you are.
If you're the best, you're the best.

09:28.434 --> 09:33.030
When you fix my heart, how soon
will I be able to play soccer again?

09:33.072 --> 09:38.032
- I missed half the season already.
- Well, um...

09:38.077 --> 09:41.376
...we'll have to see.

09:45.851 --> 09:48.115
Cristina.
Did you tell her about the ring?

09:48.154 --> 09:50.645
- I don't want to talk about your ring.
- Good. Don't.

09:50.690 --> 09:54.057
You're not doing a big, McDreamy thing?
She'd hate that.

09:54.093 --> 09:57.494
- She built a house of candles.
- She built you a house of candles.

09:57.530 --> 10:00.328
- You like that sort of thing.
- OK, thanks.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.271
How is it? The journal?
Is it gross? Are they naked?

10:06.305 --> 10:09.741
No, not yet. It's kind of, um...

10:09.775 --> 10:12.642
...hot, actually.
But, like, chastely hot.

10:12.678 --> 10:15.169
It's all stolen glances
and loaded exchanges.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.842
The thing reads like a
Victorian romance novel.

10:17.883 --> 10:20.750
- Chaste is good.
- I'll let you know when they do it.

11:07.333 --> 11:11.030
She said a thing about babies. Like
babies were a totally ordinary idea.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.868
- Not afraid. She's ready.
- When are you gonna do it?

11:13.906 --> 11:15.669
- What?
- Shepherd's proposing.

11:15.708 --> 11:20.168
- No kidding! Outstanding!
- Thank you.

11:20.212 --> 11:23.204
- How are you gonna do it?
- I don't know. I just decided.

11:23.249 --> 11:25.217
- Morning.
- Shepherd's proposing.

11:25.251 --> 11:28.743
- Congratulations. Big step.
- Thanks. Telling everybody?

11:28.788 --> 11:31.154
You need advice.
Hunt, you ever proposed?

11:31.190 --> 11:33.715
Uh, I'm not the guy to ask.
When are you gonna do it?

11:33.759 --> 11:38.093
- More importantly, how?
- What do you use, a twist-drill?

11:38.130 --> 11:41.998
Not if you don't want
a partial-parietal hematoma.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.535
- Hi.
- Good luck.

11:47.239 --> 11:50.140
Don't tell anybody else, OK?
I thought I could trust you.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.708
Of course you can trust me.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.115
We got
the short end of the stick.

11:58.150 --> 12:01.017
- Quit laughing! We're gonna get reamed.
- Dudes...

12:01.053 --> 12:04.352
The patient can see you giggling
over here like schoolgirls.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.120
- Enough wise cracks.
- Cracks!

12:08.494 --> 12:10.155
- What's funny?
- Sorry, sir.

12:10.196 --> 12:14.292
These idiots were screwing around,
and I kind of got... sucked into it.

12:14.333 --> 12:19.270
Enough. If you children
need a lesson in professionalism,

12:19.305 --> 12:21.068
then come and see how it's done.

12:24.677 --> 12:29.444
Mr. Kramer, your biplane abdominal
radiographs show a foreign body.

12:29.482 --> 12:35.114
We'll perform a sigmoidoscopy
and proceed with manual extraction.

12:35.154 --> 12:37.987
- You'll get it out?
- We'll get it out.

12:38.224 --> 12:41.489
- Hold it.
- That's the third time!

12:41.527 --> 12:44.462
- What's the problem?
- She can't find a vein.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.295
And she's pokin' me
like I'm her needlepoint.

12:47.333 --> 12:52.999
What is wrong with you people? Didn't
you practice this on each other? Look...

12:53.038 --> 12:56.735
All right. When you have a good vein,
it should feel bouncy,

12:56.776 --> 13:00.610
like this one, OK? You go in
at an angle, not at 90 degrees.

13:00.646 --> 13:02.671
Yeah. Yeah, like that.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.546
Good.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.348
Next time she'll do it on you.

13:13.025 --> 13:15.220
You know, why don't you
run them both.

13:16.629 --> 13:20.326
Listen up, you guys.
Before you run any more procedures,

13:20.366 --> 13:22.095
come see me first.

13:24.603 --> 13:27.265
So, clean bill of health
from Hunt?

13:27.306 --> 13:30.673
- Gonna get back on the horse?
- I wouldn't use the word "horse."

13:30.709 --> 13:35.476
That's not gonna work out. Things
changed. I'm gonna break up with her.

13:35.514 --> 13:38.108
You're what?
What is wrong with you?

13:40.119 --> 13:43.919
I had to make sure the patient's wife
is stable. She's hypertensive.

13:43.956 --> 13:46.584
I think this surgery's
more stressful on her than him.

13:48.527 --> 13:52.861
Damn it. There's a huge tear. Clavicle
jutting into the artery. Hold this.

13:52.898 --> 13:55.423
I'll hold pressure.
Page Hunt. Get him in!

13:55.467 --> 13:59.631
No, they can't. Patient's unstable.
Subclavian's bleeding out.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.903
- <i>It doesn't look good.</i>
- OK, thanks.

14:04.977 --> 14:08.413
What'd they say?
Did they say it's going well?

14:08.447 --> 14:12.611
It's taking... a little longer
than expected.

14:12.651 --> 14:14.812
OK...

14:14.854 --> 14:18.051
But don't worry,
because it's going great.

14:18.090 --> 14:20.820
- It is? Are you sure?
- Yes.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.227
You know, it's good
when they take their time.

14:24.263 --> 14:28.324
Right now, there is no reason
to believe that he's not gonna be...

14:28.367 --> 14:30.767
- ...just fine.
- OK.

14:30.803 --> 14:33.829
Oh, thank you.

14:34.607 --> 14:37.576
Hey, your pressure's way down.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.902
Jen?

14:42.114 --> 14:43.172
Jen!

15:05.504 --> 15:07.768
- What's happening?
- Tamponading.

15:07.806 --> 15:10.036
Her BP crashed,
she has muffled heart sounds.

15:10.075 --> 15:14.671
Damn it. Gloves.
Yang, Betadine and give her local.

15:14.713 --> 15:18.444
Stacy, sweetie,
you're gonna be all right, OK?

15:18.484 --> 15:21.112
Don't worry. 18-gauge.

15:21.153 --> 15:24.850
- What are you doing?
- Lisa, turn around or leave.

15:24.890 --> 15:29.259
You're not gonna wanna watch this.
Keep the ultrasound over the effusion.

15:29.295 --> 15:34.756
Stacy, honey, you're gonna feel a little
pinch and then a lot of pressure.

15:34.800 --> 15:39.134
And then you're gonna be
all better, OK? Here we go.

15:42.308 --> 15:46.472
Good. Oh, good job, Stacy.

15:46.512 --> 15:51.916
There. See? It's all better. Good job.

15:51.951 --> 15:56.479
Good job, honey. All better.

16:03.729 --> 16:07.130
Her pulmonary pressures are high.
She's got cor pulmonale.

16:07.166 --> 16:11.466
I'm moving up her surgery. Yang's
getting an OR now. See you in there.

16:11.503 --> 16:13.994
Let me know how it goes.
Great save, Dr. Bailey.

16:14.039 --> 16:16.303
I think you better stay.

16:16.342 --> 16:18.572
I'm not scrubbing in on this one.

16:18.610 --> 16:21.204
Bailey.

16:21.246 --> 16:23.271
- You can handle this surgery.
- I can.

16:23.315 --> 16:27.684
What I can't handle
is feeling another child slipping away,

16:27.720 --> 16:30.917
- right in front of me.
- Mostly, they don't slip away.

16:30.956 --> 16:34.119
Even the really sick ones.
Jackson was a special case.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.559
- Even he survived.
- By the skin of his teeth.

16:36.595 --> 16:39.826
But he survived.
Children are resilient.

16:39.865 --> 16:44.564
In all likelihood, you'll open this
girl's chest and fix something simple.

16:44.603 --> 16:47.834
Then you'll hand her back
the rest of her life.

16:47.873 --> 16:51.206
I'm telling you, Bailey,
you want to be there for that.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.850
Come on, come on,
come on, stabilize.

17:01.954 --> 17:04.286
BP's going up. Going up.

17:07.893 --> 17:10.191
- Thank you.
- He should be good to go.

17:10.796 --> 17:14.527
- Dr. Grey? Jen Harmon...
- Tell Jen he's stable.

17:14.566 --> 17:16.089
She's not. She had a seizure.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.603
- A seizure?
- We got him, Grey. Go help her.

17:18.637 --> 17:19.729
OK.

17:25.676 --> 17:27.872
- You're an idiot.
- Excuse me?

17:27.913 --> 17:31.349
You're an idiot.
What is your problem?

17:32.951 --> 17:38.014
He is proposing to her. That makes
Little Her his little sister.

17:38.057 --> 17:42.084
And I can't sleep with any more
of his sisters. And she's young.

17:42.127 --> 17:44.357
- And I'm her boss.
- And I'm celibate.

17:44.396 --> 17:48.492
- What's that have to do with anything?
- Celibacy's lonely. Don't spend time

17:48.534 --> 17:51.196
wondering what you are or who you like

17:51.236 --> 17:54.899
or whether it's right for you or wrong
for you. Let yourself be happy.

17:54.940 --> 17:59.673
Before you find yourself alone...
and celibate.

18:03.115 --> 18:06.084
Does she really need a chest x-ray?
She's got the flu.

18:06.118 --> 18:08.780
Say that after you've
ruled out pneumonia.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.449
Be quick and efficient,
keep a smile on your face

18:11.490 --> 18:15.153
and make stupid, happy small talk
to keep them distracted

18:15.194 --> 18:19.062
- and not panicky.
- OK. Should I do small talk now?

18:19.098 --> 18:21.225
No.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.826
Just tell me to lie still
and take a deep breath.

18:23.869 --> 18:28.101
OK. Big breath in,
and then don't move.

18:31.777 --> 18:35.110
So... how are you gonna do it?

18:35.147 --> 18:40.016
You gonna... go big?
Grand, romantic gesture?

18:40.052 --> 18:44.318
I... I don't know yet. I'm not sure
Meredith's a grand gesture girl.

18:44.356 --> 18:46.187
You want to do the grand gesture.

18:46.225 --> 18:49.194
It's the opening pitch.
It determines the entire game.

18:49.228 --> 18:53.096
You've gotta go all out.
Your plans should include flowers,

18:53.132 --> 18:57.034
candles, exotic foods,
live musicians and a rowboat.

18:57.069 --> 19:00.334
- Skywriting is not out of the question.
- Dr. Shepherd.

19:00.372 --> 19:03.307
- Yes.
- You gotta...

19:06.145 --> 19:07.874
- Hi.
- What's up?

19:07.913 --> 19:10.746
- I need a neuro consult.
- OK.

19:10.782 --> 19:14.274
- That's big. You better go.
- Thanks, chief. OK.

19:15.354 --> 19:16.878
OK.

19:19.224 --> 19:22.125
- How we doing, Mr. Kramer?
- Oh, fantastic.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.593
They didn't cover this
in the <i>What To Expect</i> books.

19:26.632 --> 19:30.090
- They didn't say "Expect seizures."
- We're doing an exam.

19:30.135 --> 19:32.899
- Look down for me.
- OK.

19:32.938 --> 19:35.600
- Oh, what's that?
- Oh, uh, Dr. Grey.

19:35.641 --> 19:38.201
Could you set up an MRl
for Mrs. Harmon, please?

19:38.243 --> 19:39.870
- Did you see...?
- Now.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.172
OK.

19:45.717 --> 19:49.312
- Oh, you saw something.
- No, no.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.652
No, I'm sorry.
Can you keep a secret?

19:51.690 --> 19:53.089
You bet I can.

19:55.727 --> 19:58.560
This is intended for Dr. Grey.

19:58.597 --> 20:01.532
- Supposed to be a surprise.
- Oh, my God, I almost blew it!

20:01.567 --> 20:03.899
When are you gonna do it?
Please do it today.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.870
- Do it here.
- No. I don't know.

20:05.904 --> 20:09.203
I was told it's supposed
to be a grand gesture.

20:09.241 --> 20:11.505
Rob proposed to me
in a supermarket aisle.

20:11.543 --> 20:14.842
He said that was the place
he saw me for the first time.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.281
So I said yes between
the cat food and the tampons.

20:18.317 --> 20:21.718
- Oh! That's romantic.
- It was, actually.

20:23.455 --> 20:26.288
We still have to do the MRl, OK?
Just to be safe.

20:26.325 --> 20:30.159
- OK. Dr. Shepherd?
- Yes.

20:31.096 --> 20:34.463
- Should I be scared?
- No. Should I?

20:35.934 --> 20:37.231
No.

20:40.439 --> 20:43.033
Eisenmenger's complex.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.203
- Can it be repaired?
- Children are resilient.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.840
Nine times out of ten
you'll find something simple to fix.

20:51.316 --> 20:54.285
- What is it?
- I can repair the VSD,

20:54.319 --> 20:58.255
but this heart is finished. This is one
of the most diseased hearts I've seen.

20:58.290 --> 21:02.727
ECMO might hold her over,
but without a heart-lung transplant,

21:02.761 --> 21:04.285
she's going to die.

21:04.329 --> 21:06.923
Dr. Bailey? Dr. Bailey?

21:06.965 --> 21:08.330
Dr. Bailey?

21:08.367 --> 21:12.133
It's OK.
I can take care of this.

21:29.388 --> 21:31.481
Her heart is too far gone.

21:31.523 --> 21:34.356
There's far too much
scar tissue to repair.

21:34.393 --> 21:38.853
We've started her on IV medications,
which she'll need on a continuous basis.

21:38.897 --> 21:43.231
- For how long? How long does she...?
- Until she can receive a transplant.

21:43.268 --> 21:46.396
- Months?
- Years, possibly.

21:46.438 --> 21:51.205
- Years? She'll lay in a bed for years?
- I'm afraid so, yes.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.281
Where's Dr. Bailey gone?

22:32.918 --> 22:35.887
<i>You want to take narrow slices</i>
<i>with the scans,</i>

22:35.921 --> 22:39.084
- <i>so you get a more comprehensive look.</i>
- OK.

22:39.124 --> 22:41.149
What do you see?

22:41.960 --> 22:45.919
Uh... I see a crazy person,

22:45.964 --> 22:48.057
taking expensive tests for no reason.

22:48.100 --> 22:51.558
And I see the chief finding out
and expelling the crazy person.

22:51.603 --> 22:55.369
Then I see joblessness,
homelessness and depression.

22:55.407 --> 22:59.434
It does not look good, Izzie.
It doesn't look good.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.078
<i>Somebody kick Dr. O'Malley</i>
<i>out of the booth.</i>

23:06.852 --> 23:09.719
- Have you seen Bailey?
- No, but I have to talk to you.

23:09.755 --> 23:13.213
Derek is going crazy. I said something
about having cute babies,

23:13.258 --> 23:15.749
and he's been acting weird
and avoiding me

23:15.794 --> 23:19.924
and dropping conversations. He wants
babies. He's always wanted babies.

23:19.965 --> 23:22.559
- Aw, he wants babies.
- Maybe not my babies.

23:22.601 --> 23:25.798
- No, that's not it.
- My babies will have Alzheimer's.

23:25.837 --> 23:29.136
And suicidal tendencies. And split ends.

23:29.174 --> 23:31.699
- You might have something.
- I don't think you do.

23:33.178 --> 23:36.773
- Who are you?
- I'm Jen.

23:38.316 --> 23:40.307
How are we doing? All set?

23:43.555 --> 23:46.786
If you're gonna do it, do it soon.
She's really freaking out.

23:48.660 --> 23:50.184
Thank you.

23:54.132 --> 23:58.125
They tried Nine? Who does Nine?

23:58.170 --> 24:00.968
Personally, I'm a fan of Five...

24:02.274 --> 24:04.572
...Seven, Eight...

24:04.609 --> 24:07.237
Pretty much 12 through 20.

24:10.882 --> 24:13.510
- I would try 15.
- Don't try 15.

24:18.390 --> 24:21.587
I would try 16. Yeah.
I've never done that before.

24:21.626 --> 24:24.459
- You'd try 16?
- Hmm-hmm. I would.

24:24.496 --> 24:27.021
I totally would.

24:28.300 --> 24:32.794
Um, don't do 16 too fast!
You can get hurt. Badly.

24:33.839 --> 24:37.536
- I've heard.
- You know who likes a good 12?

24:38.610 --> 24:40.441
Hmm-hmm.

24:42.547 --> 24:46.313
- You on-call tonight?
- Looks like it. You?

24:47.352 --> 24:48.979
Hmm-hmm.

24:55.193 --> 24:58.060
If she misses one dose of medicine,
it would be bad?

24:58.096 --> 25:01.623
- It would be fatal.
- The drug needs to be administered

25:01.666 --> 25:04.965
- at 3-minute intervals.
- She'll live in a hospital...

25:05.003 --> 25:08.370
No. There's another way.
There's a way she won't have to.

25:08.406 --> 25:12.570
- With a diagnosis of pulmonary hyper...
- The girl needs a backpack.

25:12.611 --> 25:16.103
A backpack that has a portable pump
that will deliver her meds

25:16.147 --> 25:21.210
and allow her to play
and go to school and have a childhood.

25:21.253 --> 25:24.848
- Until she gets her new heart.
- This is something we should discuss

25:24.890 --> 25:26.983
- privately...
- She can leave?

25:27.025 --> 25:30.688
She can. She has to wear
the backpack at all times.

25:30.729 --> 25:33.960
Put you in a program,
teach you to administer medications.

25:33.999 --> 25:37.230
Do you have a prettier one?

25:37.402 --> 25:41.668
- Oh, my God, Dr. Bailey. Thank you!
- Dr. Dixon, thank you so much!

25:41.706 --> 25:43.799
- So much!
- Dr. Dixon!

25:43.842 --> 25:46.970
- Thank you!
- No! No, no!

25:50.282 --> 25:51.772
No!

26:04.963 --> 26:10.799
Oh, uh... Dr. Dixon,
what can I do? How can I help?

26:10.835 --> 26:13.963
You can observe protocol.
I was getting to that option...

26:14.005 --> 26:17.668
It was too much. There was too
much yelling, too much touching.

26:17.709 --> 26:19.074
Too much.

26:22.781 --> 26:25.477
OK. I'll leave you alone.

26:25.517 --> 26:29.214
No, no! I don't need alone.
I need pressure.

26:31.156 --> 26:33.647
- I...
- I need my nervous system suppressed.

26:33.692 --> 26:36.684
I need tight constant, deep,

26:36.728 --> 26:40.824
tight pressure across
large areas of my body.

26:42.968 --> 26:45.334
I need you to hold me!

26:46.571 --> 26:49.972
- OK, um...
- Tight... tightly.

26:52.043 --> 26:53.840
Tighter.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.978
You're a very tiny person.

26:58.016 --> 27:00.246
I need a bigger person. I need more...

27:00.285 --> 27:01.912
Should I...?

27:03.154 --> 27:08.217
- Oh... What can I do?
- Get over here and hug on Dr. Dixon.

27:09.995 --> 27:13.123
- I was thinking a shot of Thorazine.
- Get over here.

27:18.169 --> 27:21.605
- Just...
- Yeah. Good.

27:26.311 --> 27:31.078
An aneurysm?
A brain aneurysm?

27:31.116 --> 27:34.847
Your symptoms, forgetfulness,
dizziness, chronic headaches,

27:34.886 --> 27:38.549
- can be associated with pregnancy.
- The reason we discovered yours

27:38.590 --> 27:41.525
- is because of the seizure.
- So, what? You can fix it?

27:41.559 --> 27:45.188
- You can take it out?
- First thing in the morning

27:45.230 --> 27:48.290
after Rob's recovered from
complications with surgery.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.130
Complications? What?

27:50.168 --> 27:52.966
You said... You said it was fine.
You said he was OK.

27:53.004 --> 27:56.098
- You lied to me?
- I'm sorry. I didn't want to worry you

27:56.141 --> 27:59.372
- until I knew. He's fine.
- You'll be fine, too.

27:59.411 --> 28:03.279
- But it could burst, right?
- Jen, you have to stay calm.

28:03.314 --> 28:05.782
You just told me there's
a time bomb in my head!

28:05.817 --> 28:09.184
I promise you that I'm not
gonna stay calm!

28:25.603 --> 28:28.663
Cows are squeezed in a chute
before they're slaughtered.

28:28.707 --> 28:33.440
The chute applies intense pressure.
resulting in decreased pulse rate,

28:33.478 --> 28:35.605
metabolic rate and muscle tone.

28:35.647 --> 28:39.242
- It calms them down.
- It calms them down.

28:40.819 --> 28:42.684
The same principles apply to me.

28:42.721 --> 28:47.454
A hugging machine is used to relax
the sympathetic nervous system.

28:47.492 --> 28:49.357
Slows the heart.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.453
This is good. This... It's working.

28:51.496 --> 28:53.828
- So we can stop now?
- No.

28:55.967 --> 28:59.061
Almost there, Mr. Kramer.

28:59.104 --> 29:02.767
- Hold on... There.
- Oh, my God!

29:06.177 --> 29:09.442
Oh, thank you! Never again
will I try to spice things up.

29:09.481 --> 29:12.382
- I'm not spicing anything up.
- You tried to step it up.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.783
Anything above Five deserves props.

29:14.819 --> 29:18.585
Sounds to me like you're doing good.
You're together,

29:18.623 --> 29:22.354
and you're both bending over backwards
to find new ways to...

29:22.393 --> 29:24.725
...make each other happy.

29:24.763 --> 29:28.756
Take a step back, you realize
that you're doing just fine.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.833
"Bending over backwards."

30:12.977 --> 30:15.002
You can let me go now.

30:18.183 --> 30:21.482
- You can let me go now.
- Sorry.

30:26.558 --> 30:29.891
Dr. Stevens, I have
the blood test results.

30:29.928 --> 30:32.988
- What is it?
- You're anemic.

30:33.031 --> 30:34.191
Anemic?

30:36.067 --> 30:37.625
Oh, my God!

30:39.671 --> 30:43.038
Do you realize what you did?
Your face said I was going to die,

30:43.074 --> 30:45.167
- not, "Go get a hamburger."
- Well, see I...

30:45.210 --> 30:48.270
That's part of patient care,
controlling your face.

30:48.313 --> 30:50.975
- I just...
- Anemic.

30:51.015 --> 30:54.781
This is fine. This is no big deal.
It's like nothing!

30:55.587 --> 30:58.681
How's Mrs. What's-her-name?

31:02.627 --> 31:05.721
That's not good, is it?

31:05.763 --> 31:07.355
Yeah. No.

31:07.398 --> 31:10.094
Her LDH is off the charts.

31:10.668 --> 31:13.398
What is it? Is it cancer?

31:15.106 --> 31:17.165
Consult Oncology. Start a work-up.

31:23.081 --> 31:24.776
Um...

31:24.816 --> 31:27.250
It's OK. We'll tell her together.

31:27.285 --> 31:29.185
Thank you.

31:36.995 --> 31:38.360
Hi.

31:42.200 --> 31:45.169
- I don't want to keep secrets.
- Sorry?

31:45.203 --> 31:47.603
I've been keeping secrets all day.

31:47.639 --> 31:50.540
About surgeries and rings and you.

31:50.575 --> 31:54.773
And that secret, the you secret,
it's giving me high blood pressure.

31:54.812 --> 31:57.975
I don't want that secret.

31:58.016 --> 32:00.883
We're having... a relationship.

32:00.919 --> 32:04.047
And if we are,
if we're in a relationship,

32:04.088 --> 32:07.524
then I need to be in it,

32:07.558 --> 32:09.492
in front of my sister.

32:09.527 --> 32:12.394
And Derek Shepherd.
If we can't do that,

32:12.430 --> 32:14.694
then I can't do this.

33:35.246 --> 33:38.215
- What's going on? What happened?
- Sorry. I can't.

33:38.249 --> 33:40.376
- You're shaking.
- Leave me alone.

33:40.418 --> 33:43.581
I saw someone. Someone I knew.
I can't do this. I can't.

33:43.621 --> 33:45.953
- OK.
- Please, go away.

33:45.990 --> 33:48.390
OK. It's all right.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.161
- It's OK.
- No, I don't want this.

33:51.195 --> 33:53.595
- I don't want this!
- I'm applying pressure.

33:53.631 --> 33:56.225
- I can't do this!
- To relax your nervous system.

33:56.267 --> 33:59.896
Decrease your metabolic rate.
You'll feel more panicked at first.

33:59.937 --> 34:05.204
You'll try to resist it, but eventually
you'll feel your pulse rate slow.

34:05.243 --> 34:08.701
Your pulse rate will slow.
It's OK. Your breath will come easier.

34:08.746 --> 34:11.715
Your breath will come easier. OK.

34:11.748 --> 34:13.649
Breathe.

34:14.819 --> 34:16.514
OK.

34:20.792 --> 34:24.819
I'm sorry for my outburst.
I should have spoken to you first.

34:24.862 --> 34:28.889
It was inappropriate, but I've come
to expect it from pediatric surgeons.

34:28.933 --> 34:32.801
- Always breaking protocol.
- I'm not a pediatric surgeon.

34:32.837 --> 34:36.534
I've landed
a few peds surg cases recently,

34:36.574 --> 34:40.271
but I'm getting back to general surgery
the first chance I get.

34:40.311 --> 34:42.938
You touch the child
whenever you speak with her.

34:42.980 --> 34:46.507
You explain conditions to the child,
not just the parents.

34:46.551 --> 34:49.315
You react to the patient
as if it was your own child.

34:49.353 --> 34:51.821
You break protocol,
which is inappropriate.

34:51.856 --> 34:56.384
Except in pediatric surgery, where
protocols are constantly evolving.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.759
You are not a general surgeon.

35:00.264 --> 35:01.891
You're a pediatric surgeon.

35:08.172 --> 35:11.335
Hey! Did you eat?
Let me change, I'll come with you.

35:11.375 --> 35:14.811
No, no, no. I can't.
I have to... work.

35:14.846 --> 35:17.781
OK, listen. You have been acting
like a basket case

35:17.815 --> 35:20.579
since I dropped that stupid
comment about babies.

35:20.618 --> 35:24.076
If you don't want babies
or if you don't want babies with me

35:24.122 --> 35:27.922
and my crappy DNA, just say so.
You don't have to avoid me

35:27.959 --> 35:32.726
- or make up lame excuses about work.
- Meredith, I want your crappy babies.

35:33.197 --> 35:36.166
- You do?
- All of them.

35:36.200 --> 35:40.728
- OK. Do you wanna eat?
- No. I have... I gotta...

35:40.771 --> 35:42.602
I have to work.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.678
Oh, my God.

35:57.722 --> 36:01.681
- Did you use a BeDazzler?
- Circa 1986.

36:01.726 --> 36:04.320
As seen on TV.

36:06.097 --> 36:08.224
Dixon's right, you know.

36:08.266 --> 36:10.564
You do belong in Peds surgery.

36:13.671 --> 36:15.969
My own baby almost died last year.

36:16.007 --> 36:21.138
The doctors in this hospital, my
friends, all worked to save his life.

36:21.179 --> 36:25.843
And I stood outside the room
feeling so useless,

36:25.883 --> 36:28.943
so pointless and helpless.

36:28.986 --> 36:32.387
Like I was losing everything
in the world.

36:32.423 --> 36:34.323
And when he didn't die,

36:34.358 --> 36:38.886
I knew I didn't want to be anywhere
near that feeling again, so...

36:38.930 --> 36:43.663
I think that makes me pretty unsuitable
for pediatric surgery.

36:45.369 --> 36:47.564
I'd say...

36:47.605 --> 36:50.938
...that makes you uniquely qualified.

36:57.515 --> 37:01.417
- Hey. You mind if I sit here?
- No, no. I'm just...

37:01.452 --> 37:02.976
...overthinking.

37:06.624 --> 37:08.114
You think he'll tell him?

37:10.361 --> 37:12.158
If he's not an idiot.

37:14.398 --> 37:18.164
- Are you OK?
- Um, uh...

37:18.736 --> 37:21.796
I don't... I'm fine.

37:34.151 --> 37:36.210
- Derek is act...
- Shh...

37:37.288 --> 37:39.779
What are you doing?

37:39.824 --> 37:41.724
I don't know. I'm just...

37:42.360 --> 37:45.887
- ...staying here.
- OK. Good night.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.922
Uh, he's planning to propose.

37:51.502 --> 37:54.938
- What?
- The chief.

37:54.972 --> 37:58.271
Your mother writes he told her
he would leave Adele.

37:58.309 --> 38:00.937
And come back and get on one knee
and propose,

38:00.978 --> 38:03.344
but I don't think he ever did.

38:04.715 --> 38:05.841
That's sad.

38:09.820 --> 38:13.312
- Is it?
- Or romantic.

38:13.758 --> 38:17.353
<i>It seems we have</i>
<i>no control whatsoever...</i>

38:18.629 --> 38:20.654
<i>...over our own hearts.</i>

38:28.172 --> 38:30.333
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:31.742 --> 38:33.710
- Ortho, right?
- Yeah. Right. Hi.

38:33.744 --> 38:38.113
I'm Arizona Robbins. Peds surgery.
I've seen you at the hospital.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.377
Are you OK?

38:39.417 --> 38:41.715
You know, I'm fine. Fine.

38:41.752 --> 38:45.347
People talk. Where we work.
They talk.

38:45.389 --> 38:47.949
A lot. So for the sake of being honest,

38:47.992 --> 38:51.519
I think I should tell you
that I know things about you.

38:52.229 --> 38:54.060
Because people talk.

38:55.166 --> 38:58.397
Oh...
You mean...

39:00.905 --> 39:04.841
- Terrific.
- It is, actually. The talk.

39:04.875 --> 39:07.275
People really like you over there.

39:07.311 --> 39:10.838
They respect you
and they're concerned and interested.

39:10.881 --> 39:15.875
They really like you.
Some of them really like you.

39:17.755 --> 39:19.655
You just look upset.

39:19.690 --> 39:23.990
And I thought that you should know
that the talk is good.

39:24.028 --> 39:29.295
And when you're not upset,
when you're over being upset,

39:29.333 --> 39:32.791
there will be people lining up for you.

39:36.907 --> 39:39.102
You want to give me some names?

39:46.984 --> 39:49.350
<i>Conditions can change</i>
<i>without warning.</i>

39:49.387 --> 39:51.855
I think you'll know.

39:58.095 --> 40:00.495
<i>Romance can make</i>
<i>the heart pound.</i>

40:03.000 --> 40:04.763
<i>Just like panic can.</i>

40:06.270 --> 40:09.364
This is stupid.
She's gonna hate this.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.773
What, the flowers?
Girls love this crap.

40:11.809 --> 40:14.107
It's a clichÃ©. I'm a clichÃ©.

40:14.145 --> 40:17.114
ClichÃ©s became clichÃ©s for a reason.

40:17.148 --> 40:19.309
Because they worked.

40:20.785 --> 40:26.121
It's great, isn't it? When you
feel so strongly for someone,

40:26.157 --> 40:28.591
and it's not just about the sex.

40:28.626 --> 40:30.150
It is...

40:31.929 --> 40:33.260
It's true.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.326
You should not talk like that.

40:38.369 --> 40:40.803
Yeah. You're right.

40:40.838 --> 40:43.238
You're all set here.
I'm gonna leave you to it.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.332
Thanks.

40:48.479 --> 40:50.106
Congratulations.

40:51.248 --> 40:52.442
Thanks.

41:00.791 --> 41:02.884
<i>And panic...</i>

41:02.927 --> 41:04.918
Addison?

41:04.962 --> 41:07.453
<i>...can make it stop cold in your chest.</i>

41:09.099 --> 41:10.498
What happened?

41:24.248 --> 41:28.309
<i>It's no wonder doctors spend so much</i>
<i>time trying to keep the heart stable.</i>

41:32.122 --> 41:33.612
<i>To keep it slow.</i>

41:37.428 --> 41:39.055
<i>Steady.</i>

41:41.398 --> 41:43.195
<i>Regular.</i>

41:46.437 --> 41:50.134
<i>To stop the heart</i>
<i>from pounding out of your chest,</i>

41:50.174 --> 41:52.642
<i>from the dread of something terrible.</i>

41:55.079 --> 41:56.774
<i>Or the anticipation...</i>

42:13.163 --> 42:15.427
<i>...of something else entirely.</i>
