Sit, sit, sit, sit.

17:23.537 --> 17:25.037
Okay.

17:25.073 --> 17:28.406
Right now I am burning
your mother to the ground,

17:28.443 --> 17:30.409
but you and your team
don't have to be singed.

17:30.445 --> 17:31.844
Speak out against her.

17:31.879 --> 17:34.313
Help me expedite the
impeachment process.

17:34.349 --> 17:35.547
And when I take office,

17:35.583 --> 17:37.315
you will all be pardoned for your role

17:37.351 --> 17:39.384
in the illegal task
force you've been running.

17:39.419 --> 17:41.552
As if I could ever
believe a word you say.

17:41.588 --> 17:43.721
See, that's the problem with your side.

17:43.756 --> 17:45.656
You think that the
truth matters to anyone,

17:45.692 --> 17:47.859
but this is a post-truth world.

17:47.894 --> 17:50.061
Nobody wants a boring fact.
They want a good story.

17:50.097 --> 17:51.896
And the better the story,

17:51.931 --> 17:54.198
the more faith they have
in the person who tells it.

17:54.233 --> 17:56.666
And the American people
never trusted your mother.

17:56.702 --> 17:57.567
But they trust me

17:57.603 --> 17:59.283
because they like what I have to say.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.705
And you told me this was
about more than the presidency.

18:01.707 --> 18:04.576
It is. And don't twist my words.

18:04.579 --> 18:06.509
Because you'll find, Mr. Haas,

18:06.512 --> 18:08.778
the America I want and you
want are not that dissimilar.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.614
I think I've heard you
speak enough for my lifetime.

18:10.616 --> 18:11.547
Cut to the chase.

18:11.582 --> 18:12.748
Why am I here?

18:12.783 --> 18:15.251
To play your part,
which you already did,

18:15.286 --> 18:16.419
because when you walk out of here,

18:16.421 --> 18:18.587
you'll be spotted by a
reporter from the <i> Journal</i>

18:18.623 --> 18:21.724
who was conveniently tipped
off about our meeting.

18:21.759 --> 18:22.691
And when they ask me,
I'll tell them that

18:22.693 --> 18:25.461
the president's son is working with me,

18:25.497 --> 18:27.130
the opposition,

18:27.165 --> 18:28.596
on the case against his mother.

18:28.632 --> 18:30.465
And the part you'll like

18:30.501 --> 18:33.601
is that you being here
will help her hang.

18:39.653 --> 18:41.776
Wait! I need to talk to you.

18:53.956 --> 18:55.722
Felix is the key to Nimah's freedom.

18:55.758 --> 18:58.759
Well, then, we'll need to
keep this between you and me.

18:58.794 --> 19:00.594
I have a plan.

19:04.612 --> 19:07.574
You can't surveil me
in the Hoover Building.

I can on your way into and out of it.

19:13.283 --> 19:14.748
My first day as a Collaborator,

19:14.784 --> 19:15.916
I walked into Langley

19:15.952 --> 19:20.421
and forced a man
I deeply respect to resign.

19:20.457 --> 19:22.056
He was nothing but good to me,

19:22.092 --> 19:23.390
and that's how I repay him?

19:23.426 --> 19:25.125
Just be thankful that's all they wanted.

19:25.161 --> 19:26.427
How do you know?

19:26.463 --> 19:28.162
How can you be so sure?

19:28.198 --> 19:30.330
Maybe that was just to lower my guard.

19:30.366 --> 19:32.232
I am about to walk into the FBI.

19:32.268 --> 19:34.034
But you are one of them now.

There are no alternate plans.

19:35.371 --> 19:36.970
No tricks, no secrets.

19:37.006 --> 19:38.446
There's just you doing what it takes

19:38.475 --> 19:39.973
to stay on the inside

19:40.009 --> 19:42.443
and stop whatever their real endgame is.

19:42.479 --> 19:43.944
Yeah.

19:43.980 --> 19:45.279
You're right.

He's still calling?

19:54.585 --> 19:56.290
What do you want me to do?

19:56.326 --> 19:57.424
He's not gonna stop.

19:57.460 --> 20:00.127
He won't, or you don't want him to?

20:00.163 --> 20:02.896
Did you ever question
Helen Sharp's loyalty like this?

20:02.932 --> 20:04.298
She didn't have
an ex-boyfriend calling her

20:04.300 --> 20:05.833

20:05.869 --> 20:08.735
Alex, in this van right now,

20:08.771 --> 20:10.304
you can acknowledge weakness,

20:10.340 --> 20:12.340
because you sure as hell can't
out there.

20:15.245 --> 20:16.978
I let go of Ryan,

20:17.013 --> 20:20.214
and he hasn't let go of me.

20:20.250 --> 20:23.150
And I hate
that he's hurting so much.

20:23.186 --> 20:24.318
Thank you.

20:27.457 --> 20:28.956
Okay.

20:28.992 --> 20:31.258
Time to be bad.

20:31.294 --> 20:33.560
You sure she can be manipulated?

20:33.596 --> 20:34.761
Yes.

20:34.797 --> 20:36.263
We use Raina
to bring down Felix,

20:36.299 --> 20:37.865
and Felix to bring down Roarke.

20:37.901 --> 20:38.832
How?

20:38.868 --> 20:40.901
Raina likes Felix.

20:40.937 --> 20:44.377
She won't willingly lie to
him or set him up.

20:44.380 --> 20:46.741
And you like Raina. Are you sure
you want to do this?

20:46.776 --> 20:49.443
I don't want to, but I
don't see another option.

20:49.479 --> 20:51.678
Raina will never get
her hands dirty if we ask.

20:51.714 --> 20:54.148
Hopefully we can get her
to manipulate Felix

without knowing that's what she's doing.

Cyberterrorism Committee.

Those reports are highly coveted
by Russian intelligence.

into giving me access

get her contacts in Russia.

21:07.797 --> 21:09.321

21:14.137 --> 21:16.137

for selling secrets,

and everyone will assume
it's on Roarke's behalf.

forgotten that they hate you

you have second-guessed me,

the same mistake a third time.

I'm sorry.

something undeniable.

23:00.476 --> 23:03.210
If you want more, I can ask Felix.

23:03.246 --> 23:04.711
No, I don't want to go around Clay.

23:04.747 --> 23:06.147
And I definitely don't
want to risk ruining

23:15.925 --> 23:17.424
I can arrange a meeting.

He'll come through.

23:18.639 --> 23:20.594
Tell him we need to meet
somewhere private

it became even clearer to me that...

What I'm trying to say
is that you're failing us

to this exercise we did

in my backpack.

Maybe I'm just panicking for no reason,

but it's the same type of water
that they give out here.

- Hold on.
- <i>I'm probably just being paranoid.</i>

25:17.113 --> 25:18.178
<i>I should get back.</i>
