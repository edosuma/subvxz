WEBVTT

01:23.133 --> 01:24.232
Smile, huh?

01:26.333 --> 01:27.732
I'm serious.

01:27.734 --> 01:30.099
You got to make this work.
This is it. Last chance.

01:30.101 --> 01:32.732
Lighten up, e.
I'm sure this will work out.

01:32.734 --> 01:34.032
You're not getting it.

01:34.034 --> 01:34.032
You burn out here

01:34.034 --> 01:37.065
and you'll be put in the
Murray hill teen facility.

01:37.067 --> 01:40.232
I don't want that, and I'm sure
you don't want that.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.631
Good morning, miss Trotter.

01:41.633 --> 01:44.598
Well, I thought I heard you
all pull up.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.698
Welcome to Thompson park,
Gilly, honey.

01:47.599 --> 01:49.199
Well, excuse me.

01:49.201 --> 01:51.631
You want to meet
your new sister, don't you?

01:51.633 --> 01:53.999
Gilly, this is William Ernest t.

01:54.001 --> 01:56.132
We called him W.E.

01:56.134 --> 01:57.398
Seriously?

01:58.432 --> 02:00.565
Y'all come on in.

02:00.567 --> 02:03.332
Turn loose my leg, honey,
so I can maneuver.

02:03.334 --> 02:04.665
Come on in, you all.

02:04.667 --> 02:07.598
Is that a moustache
on your face, Mr. Ellis?

02:07.600 --> 02:10.698
Yes.
I almost didn't recognize you.

02:10.699 --> 02:14.165
You know, my Melvin had one.
I made him shave it off.

02:14.167 --> 02:15.565
Yeah, this will all be on file.

02:15.567 --> 02:17.332
Mr. Ellis, I've been
doing this so long

02:17.334 --> 02:18.765
I practically got it memorized.

02:20.433 --> 02:23.199
Do you have cats?

02:23.201 --> 02:24.199
What, honey?

02:24.201 --> 02:25.199
Cats?

02:25.201 --> 02:27.431
No, sweetie.

02:27.433 --> 02:28.565
Smells like you do.

02:28.567 --> 02:30.199
Galadriel.

02:30.201 --> 02:31.765
William Ernest, do you want
to go upstairs

02:31.767 --> 02:34.099
and show Gilly her room?

02:34.101 --> 02:36.299
Well, we'll do that later.

02:37.733 --> 02:39.431
Well, we've been meaning

02:39.433 --> 02:41.365
to rearrange the dust
around here,

02:41.367 --> 02:42.598
haven't we, William Ernest?

02:42.600 --> 02:44.565
Social services will send

02:44.567 --> 02:46.465
Gilly's medical information
to the school.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.199
Gilly has no allergies...

02:48.201 --> 02:52.598
To cats or dust, thankfully.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.065
Yes, Gilly
is very self-sufficient,

02:54.067 --> 02:56.999
very... very independent.

02:58.167 --> 03:00.698
William Ernest, you all right?

03:00.700 --> 03:02.299
You know how to reach me?

03:02.301 --> 03:03.498
Of course I do.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.398
Yeah, this is my cell number
right there.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.398
Everything's going to be
just fine.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.531
Okay, yes, yes.

03:09.533 --> 03:12.531
Gilly, uh...
I'll see you.

03:12.533 --> 03:15.598
Be good, please.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.665
Don't you worry none,
Mr. Ellis.

03:17.667 --> 03:19.631
I think Gilly
and William Ernest and me

03:19.633 --> 03:21.299
is nearly friends already.

03:21.301 --> 03:23.665
My Melvin, god rest him,

03:23.667 --> 03:26.365
used to say I never met a child
I couldn't make friends with.

03:26.367 --> 03:27.531
Oh, I believe that.

03:49.599 --> 03:51.165
Whoo.

03:53.366 --> 03:55.065
You need anything, you just give

03:55.067 --> 03:56.099
old Trotter a holler.

03:56.101 --> 03:57.498
The TV's downstairs.

03:57.500 --> 04:00.331
You're welcome to come on down
to watch.

04:00.333 --> 04:02.531
This is your home too now.

04:06.566 --> 04:10.531
It's going to be okay, honey.

04:10.533 --> 04:13.132
I know it must have been hard
switching all around.

04:13.134 --> 04:14.631
I like moving.

04:14.633 --> 04:16.232
It's boring to stay
in one place.

04:16.233 --> 04:18.031
This way I get to see more
of the world.

04:20.100 --> 04:24.199
Well, welcome
to our little corner of it.

04:24.201 --> 04:26.264
Now, you make yourself
at home, you hear?

04:26.266 --> 04:27.298
I'm making, okay?

04:37.599 --> 04:41.765
Mom, if you only knew
where they've put me.

04:41.767 --> 04:42.766
If you only knew.

04:52.332 --> 04:54.065
William Ernest
is in the living room

04:54.067 --> 04:56.065
watching <i> telly's trolley.</i>

04:56.067 --> 04:58.264
You're welcome to join him
if you like.

04:58.266 --> 05:01.298
Why in the world would I ever
watch a retard show like that?

05:03.466 --> 05:05.199
Listen here, miss Gilly Hopkins.

05:05.201 --> 05:07.132
One thing we better get straight

05:07.134 --> 05:08.498
right here tonight.

05:08.500 --> 05:11.198
I won't have you making fun
of that boy.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.999
Just because somebody
ain't quite as smart as you

05:13.001 --> 05:14.598
don't give you no right
to look down on him.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.331
Who am I looking down on?

05:16.333 --> 05:19.264
You just said. You just said
William Ernest is retarded.

05:19.266 --> 05:21.498
I did not.
I don't even know the kid.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.331
I've never seen him
before today.

05:23.333 --> 05:25.531
I just don't want to watch
a stupid kid's show.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.431
He's had a rough time
in this world,

05:27.433 --> 05:30.264
but he's with Trotter now.

05:30.266 --> 05:31.631
And as long as
the lord keeps him

05:31.633 --> 05:34.198
in this house and sees fit
that I take care of him,

05:34.200 --> 05:37.198
ain't nobody on this earth
going to hurt him again.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.565
Nobody, in any way.

05:39.567 --> 05:41.732
God, all I was trying to...
One more thing.

05:41.734 --> 05:44.665
In this house, we don't take
the lord's name in vain.

05:44.667 --> 05:47.732
All right, all right, already.
Forget it.

05:50.265 --> 05:53.365
Supper's almost ready.

05:53.367 --> 05:56.264
Why don't you go get
Mr. Randolph.

05:56.266 --> 05:57.264
Who?

05:57.266 --> 05:59.065
He eats with us at night.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.999
I was going to send
William Ernest to fetch him,

06:01.001 --> 06:03.565
but I think you'd be
a nice surprise.

06:41.599 --> 06:45.032
William Ernest, is that you?

06:47.399 --> 06:50.198
No, it's me.

06:50.200 --> 06:54.465
Oh. You must be the new girl.
Welcome.

06:54.467 --> 06:58.065
My name's
Mr. Reginald Randolph,

06:58.067 --> 07:00.431
and it's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

07:00.433 --> 07:03.465
Yeah, well, Trotter sent me

07:03.467 --> 07:05.198
over here to take you to supper.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.631
Oh, thank you.
Thank you kindly.

07:07.633 --> 07:09.298
No sweat.

07:11.733 --> 07:14.231
Oh!
Watch it, watch it.

07:14.233 --> 07:15.665
Thank you.

07:15.667 --> 07:16.999
Sure.

07:19.767 --> 07:22.565
This little angel kept me
from falling flat on my face.

07:23.567 --> 07:25.231
Well, I guess this old house

07:25.233 --> 07:27.531
will be a little livelier now,
eh, Mrs. Trotter?

07:27.533 --> 07:30.598
I wouldn't be surprised,
Mr. Randolph.

07:33.266 --> 07:34.999
Would you like
to say grace, Gilly?

07:37.199 --> 07:40.198
Mrs. Trotter, it would be
my pleasure

07:40.200 --> 07:43.431
to pass a blessing
on this bountiful feast.

07:43.433 --> 07:46.498
Well, thank you,
Mr. Randolph.

07:46.500 --> 07:50.598
Dear lord, we thank you

07:50.600 --> 07:54.264
for this most bountiful feast,

07:54.266 --> 07:58.331
and for the gift and privilege

07:58.333 --> 08:04.098
to share it with the newest
addition to our family.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.465
Amen.

08:05.467 --> 08:07.064
Amen.

08:11.432 --> 08:13.665
<i>Where are you, mom?</i>

08:13.667 --> 08:15.298
<i>I imagine you're doing something</i>

08:15.300 --> 08:17.598
<i>incredibly exciting right now.</i>

08:17.600 --> 08:19.732
<i>I wish I knew where you were
so I could tell you</i>

08:19.734 --> 08:21.298
<i>that I'm stuck in another place</i>

08:21.300 --> 08:23.398
<i>where I hate everybody.</i>

08:23.400 --> 08:25.098
<i>I won't be here long</i>

08:25.100 --> 08:26.631
<i>and I'll do whatever I can
to find you,</i>

08:26.633 --> 08:28.031
<i>and we can be a family.</i>

08:29.333 --> 08:31.131
What?

08:33.332 --> 08:35.631
I thought you might like
to be tucked in.

08:35.633 --> 08:39.063
I don't get tucked, thank you.

08:39.066 --> 08:41.198
Well, then may I come in?

08:41.200 --> 08:43.765
The door was closed
for a reason.

08:43.767 --> 08:45.998
I'm trying to go to sleep.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.298
All right, then.
Good night.

09:06.065 --> 09:07.465
What do I always say?

09:07.467 --> 09:11.264
Common denominators
are our friends.

09:11.266 --> 09:13.732
Yes, common denominators
are our friends.

09:13.734 --> 09:16.598
Oh, welcome.

09:23.065 --> 09:25.198
I'm miss Harris.

09:27.332 --> 09:30.198
Galadriel Hopkins.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.164
What a beautiful name.

09:32.166 --> 09:33.698
From Tolkien, of course.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.331
No, Sherman school.

09:36.633 --> 09:38.365
Galadriel is the name
of a great queen

09:38.367 --> 09:41.064
in a book by a man
named Tolkien.

09:41.066 --> 09:43.231
Well, I'd rather
be called Gilly.

09:43.233 --> 09:45.665
Well, Gilly it is then.

09:45.667 --> 09:48.098
Gilly, why don't you take
that empty seat

09:48.100 --> 09:50.398
next to Monica Bradley.

09:51.733 --> 09:53.365
Oh, here.

09:55.299 --> 09:58.331
We're on page 27.

09:58.333 --> 10:01.198
Now, who can find
the common denominator

10:01.200 --> 10:02.598
of this equation?

10:02.600 --> 10:05.064
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Rajeem.

10:20.065 --> 10:23.331
I know you're probably
playing catch up.

10:23.333 --> 10:24.631
Did you work
on divisional fractions

10:24.633 --> 10:26.465
at your last school?

10:26.467 --> 10:28.431
Yeah.

10:31.733 --> 10:33.598
No.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.064
Why don't you pull your chair up

10:35.066 --> 10:37.331
to my desk and we'll work on it.

10:38.533 --> 10:41.264
Push your chairs in, people.

10:58.566 --> 11:00.565
I know who you are.

11:00.567 --> 11:02.998
Oh, yeah? Who am I?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.131
You're the new kid.
I saw you in the cafeteria.

11:05.133 --> 11:06.431
I get free lunch too.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.131
I'm very happy for you.

11:08.133 --> 11:10.198
I'm Agnes.
I'm sorry.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.732
You going to tell me your name?

11:11.734 --> 11:13.565
Well, you going to get out
of my face?

11:13.567 --> 11:15.665
Hey, don't push me.
What's your problem?

11:15.667 --> 11:17.231
My problem?

11:17.233 --> 11:20.598
My problem is a whiny
little busybody named Agnes

11:20.600 --> 11:22.498
who can't take a hint.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.565
I thought since you was new

11:24.567 --> 11:26.264
you might want a friend
to show you around.

11:26.266 --> 11:27.565
Well, how about no.

11:27.567 --> 11:29.732
You're bothering me, so beat it.

11:29.734 --> 11:31.331
Go!

11:39.399 --> 11:41.064
A little help?

11:47.733 --> 11:49.231
Hey!

11:54.065 --> 11:55.598
Hey, hey!

11:57.299 --> 11:58.298
Hey, get her!

11:58.300 --> 12:00.732
Hey, get back here!

12:06.666 --> 12:09.298
Ow!

12:23.265 --> 12:24.465
I know you're new to all this,

12:24.467 --> 12:26.698
but we have
a zero tolerance policy

12:26.700 --> 12:27.764
at this school.

12:27.766 --> 12:29.164
We're not going to put up

12:29.166 --> 12:30.231
with fighting on the playground

12:30.233 --> 12:31.565
or anywhere else around here.

12:31.567 --> 12:34.531
I think you need
to understand that, Gilly.

12:34.533 --> 12:36.698
You're at a new school now.

12:36.700 --> 12:40.264
You have a chance
to make a new start.

12:40.266 --> 12:41.631
If there's anything
you want to talk about...

12:41.633 --> 12:43.298
I'm okay.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.031
I'm fine.

12:50.265 --> 12:52.732
Look, if you don't want help,

12:52.734 --> 12:54.998
there's no way I can make you
accept it,

12:55.000 --> 12:57.731
but you're not going to turn
this school or my class

12:57.733 --> 12:59.431
into a zoo.

12:59.433 --> 13:02.331
I've decided for the next
few recess periods,

13:02.333 --> 13:04.331
you can use the time
to catch up on math.

13:04.333 --> 13:06.331
Rajeem.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.031
Rajeem has kindly offered
to work

13:08.033 --> 13:09.698
with you during that time,

13:09.700 --> 13:11.365
so starting tomorrow
you are to come back here

13:11.367 --> 13:12.531
following lunch.

13:12.533 --> 13:14.031
The law requires me
to have recess.

13:14.033 --> 13:16.698
No, actually it doesn't.

13:25.732 --> 13:27.598
What do you want?

13:27.600 --> 13:30.131
Nothing.
Just walking home.

13:30.133 --> 13:33.064
That was great, you beating up
those five boys.

13:33.066 --> 13:34.498
Six. One ran away.

13:36.132 --> 13:38.064
I thought you and me
should get together.

13:38.066 --> 13:40.131
Since you don't know anybody
and I've been here a while,

13:40.133 --> 13:42.198
I could...
I don't need to know anybody.

13:42.200 --> 13:43.998
I'm not here for long.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.631
You still haven't told me
your name.

13:45.633 --> 13:47.398
Duh, you're real quick.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.764
So, you're not going to tell me?

13:49.766 --> 13:52.064
If I tell you,
will you leave me alone?

13:52.066 --> 13:54.598
My name is Gilly.
Gilly Hopkins. You got that?

13:54.600 --> 13:57.164
You can call me Ag if you want.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.731
Want to come over?
My dad won't mind.

13:58.733 --> 14:01.298
Can't. I'm almost home.

14:01.300 --> 14:04.064
William Ernest,
honey, is that you?

14:04.066 --> 14:05.697
No.

14:05.699 --> 14:08.531
Oh, Gilly, honey,
how was school today?

14:08.533 --> 14:10.198
Did you make any new friends?

14:10.200 --> 14:11.565
No.

14:11.567 --> 14:13.531
Gilly, wait a minute, honey.

14:13.533 --> 14:15.565
You've got some mail.

14:15.567 --> 14:17.164
It's a postcard.

14:17.166 --> 14:19.198
Came this morning.

14:35.199 --> 14:37.631
<i>"My dearest Galadriel,</i>

14:37.632 --> 14:40.031
<i>"the agency told me
you had moved.</i>

14:40.033 --> 14:41.598
<i>"I wish it were to here.</i>

14:41.600 --> 14:44.331
<i>I miss you.
All my love, Courtney."</i>

14:45.733 --> 14:48.331
Anything I can do for you, hon?

14:48.333 --> 14:50.764
Can anyone have any privacy
in this dump?

14:50.766 --> 14:53.465
Well, I just want to make sure
you're all right.

14:53.467 --> 14:56.298
I will be as soon as you get
your fat self out of here.

14:56.300 --> 14:58.198
We'll be downstairs.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.565
Dinner will be ready
in a little while.

15:09.466 --> 15:11.630
I don't need help from anybody!

15:16.466 --> 15:18.064
Except from you, mom.

15:18.066 --> 15:20.064
If I can find you, write to you,

15:20.066 --> 15:23.431
and if I ask,
would you come and get me?

15:23.433 --> 15:26.098
I'd be good for you.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.697
I'd change into
a whole new person.

15:27.699 --> 15:30.731
I'd turn from gruesome Gilly

15:30.733 --> 15:34.365
into good, glamorous,
gorgeous Galadriel.

15:54.666 --> 15:56.198
Let's go home, baby.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.098
San Francisco.

16:17.698 --> 16:21.365
Well, miss Gilly,
how's school for you today?

16:21.367 --> 16:22.664
I've seen better.

16:22.666 --> 16:24.331
God, you young people

16:24.333 --> 16:26.131
have such an opportunity today.

16:26.133 --> 16:28.064
When I was in school...

16:28.066 --> 16:29.597
Thank you, Mrs. Trotter.

16:29.599 --> 16:32.131
Oh, and the ketchup, please.

16:32.133 --> 16:34.564
What's new, doo-doo?

16:34.566 --> 16:36.498
What's wrong, William Ernest?

16:36.500 --> 16:38.498
Honey, did something go down
the wrong pipe?

16:38.500 --> 16:40.597
Do you want me to SWAT him one
on the back to knock it loose?

16:40.599 --> 16:43.431
Nobody's gonna hit you, honey.

16:43.433 --> 16:45.331
Everybody's just trying to help.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.131
Ain't that right, Gilly?

16:47.133 --> 16:48.764
Just trying to help you,
little buddy.

16:48.766 --> 16:51.564
He don't always know that.

16:51.566 --> 16:55.031
Well, I got your back, W.E.

16:59.366 --> 17:02.198
I got an idea,
Mr. Randolph.

17:02.200 --> 17:05.263
Since Gilly's feeling
so helpful,

17:05.266 --> 17:06.564
maybe she'd like to read for us.

17:06.566 --> 17:08.031
What?

17:08.032 --> 17:09.330
Would you do that, miss Gilly?

17:09.333 --> 17:11.630
It would be
such a pleasure to me.

17:11.632 --> 17:13.464
I don't have anything to read.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.597
Mr. Randolph
has enough books

17:17.598 --> 17:20.064
to keep you busy
for a thousand years.

17:20.066 --> 17:21.431
I do have a few.

17:21.433 --> 17:23.597
Of course there's a Bible
right here.

17:23.598 --> 17:25.464
I'll get a book.

17:38.665 --> 17:41.298
Freaking blind people.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.530
What is he, a librarian?

18:13.598 --> 18:17.198
Gilly, honey, are you in here?

18:17.200 --> 18:20.398
Mr. Randolph was worried maybe
all the bulbs had burnt out.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.497
He tends to forget since they
don't really help him much.

18:23.499 --> 18:25.664
Well, there's enough light here.

18:25.666 --> 18:27.630
If there hadn't been,
I would have gone back.

18:27.632 --> 18:29.098
I'm not retarded.

18:29.100 --> 18:31.164
I believe
you mentioned that before.

18:31.166 --> 18:33.464
Did you find something to read
for Mr. Randolph?

18:33.466 --> 18:36.064
Got one right here.

18:36.066 --> 18:38.597
<i>The Oxford book
of English verse.</i>

18:38.599 --> 18:40.298
I'll give it a whirl.

18:42.065 --> 18:45.331
What lovely reading material
did you bring us?

18:45.333 --> 18:48.597
It's them poems we was reading
last year, Mr. Randolph.

18:48.599 --> 18:50.530
English poems.

18:50.532 --> 18:54.630
Page 357, William Wordsworth.

18:54.632 --> 18:57.697
"There was a time
when Meadow..."

18:57.699 --> 19:00.530
found it.

19:00.532 --> 19:03.131
"There was a time when Meadow,
grove and stream,

19:03.133 --> 19:05.464
"the earth
and every common sight

19:05.466 --> 19:06.731
"to me did seem,

19:06.733 --> 19:08.464
"appareled in celestial light,

19:08.466 --> 19:11.497
the glory and the freshness
of a dream."

19:11.499 --> 19:13.298
Oh, yes, yes.

19:15.065 --> 19:18.031
"It is not now
as it hath been of yore,

19:18.033 --> 19:22.597
"turn wheresoe'er I may
by night or day.

19:22.599 --> 19:24.764
"The things which
I have seen..."

19:24.766 --> 19:27.231
I now can see no more."
"I now can see no more."

19:29.698 --> 19:31.664
Go on, child.

19:34.431 --> 19:37.098
"Our birth is but a sleep
and a forgetting

19:37.100 --> 19:41.164
"the soul that rises with us,
our life's star.

19:41.166 --> 19:44.064
"Hath had elsewhere its setting

19:44.066 --> 19:45.530
"and cometh from afar.

19:45.532 --> 19:49.731
"Not in entire forgetfulness
and not in utter nakedness,

19:49.733 --> 19:52.530
"but trailing clouds of glory
do we come

19:52.532 --> 19:55.064
"from god who is our home.

19:55.066 --> 19:58.198
"Thanks to the human heart
by which we live.

19:58.200 --> 20:02.464
"Thanks to its tenderness,
its joys and fears.

20:02.466 --> 20:05.630
"To me the meanest flower
that blows

20:05.632 --> 20:09.031
"can give thoughts that do often

20:09.033 --> 20:12.530
lie too deep for tears."

20:14.233 --> 20:16.131
Miss Gilly, that was lovely.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.998
He sure is a handsome reader.

20:21.165 --> 20:24.430
Miss Gilly, how to do you feel
about Mr. Wordsworth?

20:24.432 --> 20:27.597
Weird, and it makes no sense.

20:27.599 --> 20:30.330
"Cometh from afar"?
"Nakedness"?

20:30.332 --> 20:32.264
That's some weird sh...

20:33.465 --> 20:34.497
Stuff.

20:35.531 --> 20:38.264
Yeah, and right here...

20:38.266 --> 20:39.731
"The meanest flower."

20:39.733 --> 20:41.497
Whoever heard of a mean flower?

20:41.499 --> 20:42.731
The word "mean"

20:42.733 --> 20:44.764
has other definitions,
miss Gilly.

20:44.766 --> 20:48.731
The poet is talking
about humility, loneliness,

20:48.733 --> 20:52.064
not bad nature.

20:52.066 --> 20:55.031
Well, I've never seen
a flower blow either.

20:55.033 --> 20:57.098
Dandelions.

20:57.100 --> 20:59.998
That may be exactly
the flower that Mr. Wordsworth

21:00.000 --> 21:01.297
was thinking about.

21:01.299 --> 21:03.998
It surly is one
of the lowest flowers.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.131
And they sure do blow.

21:06.133 --> 21:08.031
Yes.
Just like William Ernest says,

21:08.033 --> 21:09.530
they blow all over the place.

21:09.532 --> 21:13.697
Yes.
Isn't W.E. Impressive, Gilly?

21:13.699 --> 21:16.064
I didn't know
he could even speak.

21:16.066 --> 21:19.497
Oh, our little W can speak,
bless him.

21:19.499 --> 21:24.998
He just chooses his times.
Special moments.

21:34.264 --> 21:35.497
Howdy, partner.

21:35.499 --> 21:37.364
Funny how we keep
running into each other.

21:37.366 --> 21:38.998
Yeah, it's freaking hilarious.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.597
What do you think
of coach Delaney?

21:40.599 --> 21:41.664
I don't see how she can be

21:41.666 --> 21:43.131
our gym teacher when she smokes.

21:43.133 --> 21:44.464
I mean, I've never seen
her smoke,

21:44.466 --> 21:46.330
but Darlene wicker said
she saw her at the mall,

21:46.332 --> 21:48.397
and she was...
Agnes, I've grown to hate you!

21:48.399 --> 21:49.530
Now, I know
we've known each other

21:49.532 --> 21:51.064
for the briefest of time,

21:51.066 --> 21:53.031
but if you open
that freaking piehole

21:53.033 --> 21:54.430
one more time,

21:54.432 --> 21:55.998
I'm going to shove my fist
right down it,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.297
tear out your tongue,
and mail it to Mars.

21:58.299 --> 21:59.731
Now, if you speak,

21:59.733 --> 22:02.164
it'll be your last words
on this planet.

22:07.631 --> 22:09.230
And we have an apple.

22:11.165 --> 22:13.430
And a "sandywhich."

22:15.231 --> 22:17.731
And a juicy box.

22:17.733 --> 22:20.197
Hey.
W.E., head inside.

22:20.199 --> 22:22.464
I said...
Hang on there, dumbo.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.731
W.E., it's fine.
Go inside.

22:24.733 --> 22:26.731
What did you call me?
Listen, ears Magee,

22:26.733 --> 22:28.230
it's like 8:00 A.M.

22:28.232 --> 22:30.297
You already finish off
your own lunch?

22:30.299 --> 22:33.230
Or did you misplace it?
Can I check behind the ears?

22:33.232 --> 22:34.364
What?

22:34.366 --> 22:37.731
You have big-ass ears!

22:37.733 --> 22:39.731
Shut up, you two.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.597
All right, sweetie... aah!

22:41.599 --> 22:43.064
Nobody calls me "sweetie."

22:43.066 --> 22:44.530
I get enough of that crap
at home.

22:44.532 --> 22:46.297
I think you broke my leg.

22:46.299 --> 22:49.031
It's called a shin kick, Spock.

22:49.033 --> 22:51.197
Now, if I ever see you
even near that kid,

22:51.199 --> 22:52.397
you'll wish the gods above

22:52.399 --> 22:54.397
had never let your parents meet.

22:54.399 --> 22:57.998
You should put some ice on that
or you'll have a wicked bruise.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.297
Who are you?

22:59.299 --> 23:00.597
Name's Hopkins.

23:00.599 --> 23:03.530
Gilly Hopkins.

23:06.999 --> 23:09.098
Now, don't get any ideas
of me liking you

23:09.100 --> 23:12.497
or us being buddies
or anything like that.

23:12.499 --> 23:14.064
People just got to understand

23:14.066 --> 23:15.998
that if anyone's
going to be picking on you,

23:16.000 --> 23:17.697
it's going to be me.

23:17.699 --> 23:19.364
Got that?

23:21.665 --> 23:23.497
Here.

23:23.499 --> 23:25.230
Do you have your math book?

23:25.232 --> 23:27.330
Why would you want to do this?
Tutor me?

23:27.332 --> 23:30.330
I offer to help tutor anyone
in class for miss Harris

23:30.332 --> 23:31.497
for extra credit.

23:31.499 --> 23:32.497
Do you need extra credit?

23:32.499 --> 23:34.163
No.

23:34.165 --> 23:35.497
Well, it's like using
three pieces of bread

23:35.499 --> 23:36.530
for a sandwich.

23:38.032 --> 23:39.197
Doesn't make much sense.

23:39.199 --> 23:40.597
I'm sorry, a sandwich?

23:40.599 --> 23:44.130
How about I call you loaf?
That work for you?

23:44.132 --> 23:45.530
No.
Loaf it is.

23:45.532 --> 23:47.197
Let's just do this.

23:51.131 --> 23:52.697
Very interesting perspective,
Gilly.

23:52.699 --> 23:55.364
There's no marks on it.
Why don't I get an a-plus?

23:57.199 --> 23:59.630
I said it was very interesting,

23:59.632 --> 24:01.230
but it's not brilliant.

24:01.232 --> 24:03.664
But give yourself some time.

24:03.666 --> 24:05.097
You're new here.

24:15.298 --> 24:16.530
Gilly.

24:20.665 --> 24:22.330
Hey, Gilly.

24:22.332 --> 24:24.130
Are you freaking stalking me?

24:24.132 --> 24:27.464
No. I was in the neighborhood
and wanted to visit.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.197
Yeah, well, hey, I'm great.

24:29.199 --> 24:31.464
Nice visit.
Now just leave me alone.

24:31.466 --> 24:34.464
Come on, Gilly, I just want
to know how you're doing.

24:34.466 --> 24:36.364
Yeah, so you can
pretend to care.

24:36.366 --> 24:37.764
Forget it.

24:37.766 --> 24:40.530
Okay, this is hard having
a conversation like this.

24:40.532 --> 24:42.297
Can you please get in the car?

24:43.665 --> 24:46.097
Gilly, can you please
get in the car?

24:46.099 --> 24:47.464
No.
Why?

24:47.466 --> 24:49.163
Because of your accident.
What accident?

24:51.732 --> 24:52.764
Oh!

24:56.264 --> 24:58.597
I don't understand.

24:58.599 --> 25:00.197
Listen, I'm sorry.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.430
Your car...
Your car is fine.

25:02.432 --> 25:04.297
Mine is...

25:07.198 --> 25:08.731
You don't need...

25:32.698 --> 25:38.030
"Last known address, 32
cardinal Lane, apartment 1A,

25:38.032 --> 25:41.163
San Francisco, California."

25:41.165 --> 25:42.764
Okay...

25:57.298 --> 25:59.297
How's it been
making friends at school?

25:59.299 --> 26:00.664
Fine.

26:02.531 --> 26:04.297
How's miss Harris?
Is she...

26:04.299 --> 26:06.664
Fine.
Gilly...

26:06.666 --> 26:08.530
Answering "fine"
to every question I ask you

26:08.532 --> 26:09.664
is not what I want from you.

26:09.666 --> 26:11.130
What do you want from me?

26:12.298 --> 26:15.163
I want to know you're okay.

26:15.165 --> 26:17.130
Well, I'm better than your car.

26:25.698 --> 26:27.697
Is that you,
William Ernest, honey?

26:27.699 --> 26:30.997
No, it's me,
Maime Trotter, sweetie, baby.

26:30.999 --> 26:34.197
How about some of Trotter's
famous chocolate chip cookies?

26:34.199 --> 26:36.297
Nah. I'm dieting.

26:36.299 --> 26:38.564
Are you sure?

26:38.566 --> 26:40.664
I'm sure, Trotter,
sugar pie, honeybunch.

26:47.732 --> 26:50.230
I'm too smart to be bought
by chocolate chip cookies.

26:50.232 --> 26:51.630
Nice try, Maime.

26:51.632 --> 26:53.464
You're going to have to try
a lot harder

26:53.466 --> 26:55.097
to slip old Gilly up.

26:59.398 --> 27:01.097
There's got to be more.

27:01.099 --> 27:03.230
How to get it?

27:03.232 --> 27:06.163
I could use Agnes to help me
get Randolph's loot,

27:06.165 --> 27:07.530
but with that mouth...

27:08.732 --> 27:10.997
I need someone who won't talk.

27:13.198 --> 27:15.530
Somebody who can't talk.

27:17.531 --> 27:19.530
<i>Dum-Dee-dum-dum-dum.</i>

27:19.532 --> 27:21.564
<i>Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.</i>

27:21.566 --> 27:23.731
<i>Me going to have nice picnic.</i>

27:23.733 --> 27:26.564
<i>Yeah, me got everything me need.</i>

27:26.566 --> 27:29.063
<i>We have cookies.</i>

27:29.065 --> 27:31.564
<i>And more cookies.</i>

27:31.566 --> 27:34.030
<i>And me got some more cookies.</i>

27:34.032 --> 27:38.530
<i>And...
Ah, me got more cookies!</i>

28:11.465 --> 28:15.063
Boy, I hope I can find somebody

28:15.065 --> 28:16.697
to help me fly this sucker.

28:26.431 --> 28:30.163
Man, I just can't get the hang
of this airplane tossing stuff.

28:31.365 --> 28:32.731
Do you want to give it a try?

28:40.231 --> 28:44.530
Pow! It flies really good.

28:44.532 --> 28:45.731
No, that's you, W.E.

28:45.733 --> 28:48.697
You throw really good.

28:48.699 --> 28:50.464
I was just admiring your style.

28:50.466 --> 28:52.697
You've had lessons.

28:52.699 --> 28:55.230
No?
You just taught yourself?

28:56.998 --> 28:58.263
No fooling?

28:58.265 --> 29:00.731
Gee, man, you're a real natural.

29:00.733 --> 29:03.530
Hey, Trotter,
you've got to see this.

29:03.532 --> 29:05.997
W.E. Can do this
real good.

29:09.365 --> 29:10.664
Here.

29:11.764 --> 29:13.330
Watch me.

29:13.332 --> 29:15.731
We're watching,
William Ernest, honey.

29:15.733 --> 29:18.063
W.E. Has a paper airplane.

29:24.064 --> 29:25.063
Pow!

29:25.065 --> 29:26.163
How was it?

29:26.165 --> 29:27.731
Oh, Mr. Randolph,

29:27.733 --> 29:30.130
I never thought paper airplanes
was good for anything

29:30.132 --> 29:31.564
except maybe
driving teachers crazy.

29:33.765 --> 29:35.497
Thank you.

29:35.499 --> 29:37.530
Sure.

29:37.532 --> 29:39.330
Mr. Randolph,

29:39.332 --> 29:41.063
how about me helping you
to the dining room?

29:41.065 --> 29:45.297
Well, thank you, miss Gilly.

29:45.299 --> 29:48.063
I want to see it one more time,
William Ernest.

29:48.065 --> 29:49.730
So, first...

30:28.998 --> 30:30.696
What's the matter, W.E.?

30:30.698 --> 30:32.730
I "broked" it.

30:32.732 --> 30:33.997
Let me see.

30:35.665 --> 30:37.397
It's ruined.

30:37.399 --> 30:40.664
Oh, man, this is nothing.
We can fix this right up.

30:40.666 --> 30:42.597
But it's not perfect anymore.

30:42.599 --> 30:46.464
Perfect? W.E., it wasn't
perfect to begin with.

30:46.466 --> 30:48.564
Besides, nobody likes perfect.

30:48.566 --> 30:50.597
Really?
Yeah.

30:50.599 --> 30:54.597
Think of this little old tear
as a battle scar.

30:54.599 --> 30:56.330
Battle scar?
Yeah.

30:56.332 --> 30:59.030
Like in world war ii,
there'd be these planes

30:59.032 --> 31:00.530
that would come back
from bombing missions,

31:00.532 --> 31:02.464
and they'd be all banged up.

31:02.466 --> 31:05.197
Missing parts of their tails,
holes in the wings,

31:05.199 --> 31:06.297
really beat up.

31:09.531 --> 31:11.597
But you know what?

31:11.599 --> 31:13.230
They were the tough suckers.

31:13.232 --> 31:14.997
They flew better
than all the other planes

31:14.999 --> 31:16.497
that looked perfect.

31:16.499 --> 31:18.564
Their pilots didn't want
the planes that were all new.

31:18.566 --> 31:21.564
They trusted
their busted up planes.

31:21.566 --> 31:26.330
They liked their battle scars.

31:26.332 --> 31:30.397
You'll see. We'll fly it
tomorrow before going to school.

31:33.531 --> 31:35.597
Battle scar.

31:35.599 --> 31:36.663
Yeah.

31:36.665 --> 31:39.230
Now go to bed.

31:39.232 --> 31:41.497
Battle scar.

31:54.064 --> 31:56.197
What?

32:00.630 --> 32:02.663
What do you want?

32:02.665 --> 32:04.430
Can I sit with you?

32:05.465 --> 32:07.197
These are all taken.

32:10.164 --> 32:11.696
It was a joke, you spaz.

32:13.398 --> 32:16.464
You can sit here if you want.

32:16.466 --> 32:19.297
Let's start
with small sentences.

32:19.299 --> 32:20.596
Cool.

32:20.598 --> 32:23.030
Smaller.

32:23.032 --> 32:25.197
The absolute value of a number

32:25.199 --> 32:27.364
is the distance between
the number and zero

32:27.366 --> 32:29.063
on the number line.

32:29.065 --> 32:31.163
Now to page 34.

32:31.165 --> 32:32.530
I think we're done here.

32:32.532 --> 32:34.696
But we have a quiz.
I know what I'm doing.

32:34.698 --> 32:37.030
Turning in blank papers.
Drives them crazy.

32:37.032 --> 32:38.364
Works every time.

32:38.366 --> 32:39.563
But that doesn't reflect well
on me.

32:39.565 --> 32:41.297
I'm your tutor.

32:41.299 --> 32:44.197
Your failure demonstrates
I failed in educating you.

32:44.199 --> 32:46.263
Are you freaking kidding me?

32:46.265 --> 32:47.663
When did this become about you?

32:47.665 --> 32:51.097
I have a reputation.
As the king of math nerds?

32:51.099 --> 32:52.997
Oh, nice title, raj.

32:52.999 --> 32:54.663
Seriously, why would anybody
need to know

32:54.665 --> 32:56.464
how to divide one-third
by two-fifteenths?

32:56.466 --> 32:57.997
I'm not sure
if we necessarily need

32:57.999 --> 33:00.497
to question the reason
for the equation.

33:00.499 --> 33:02.330
Yeah, that's how the Nazis
got started.

33:02.332 --> 33:04.197
Just do it and don't ask why.

33:04.199 --> 33:05.430
What?

33:05.432 --> 33:06.563
Nazis were huge mathematicians,

33:06.565 --> 33:08.030
by the way.

33:16.231 --> 33:18.364
A new strategy, I see.

33:18.366 --> 33:21.263
A's to F's.

33:21.265 --> 33:24.330
But you didn't fail completely.

33:24.332 --> 33:26.330
See? You got your plus.

33:26.332 --> 33:28.330
Got your name right
on all of them.

33:28.332 --> 33:31.197
So, if you were attempting

33:31.199 --> 33:32.763
to succeed in 100% failure,

33:32.765 --> 33:35.596
your attempts were flawed.

33:36.731 --> 33:38.596
In order to get a zero grade,

33:38.598 --> 33:43.197
you should follow the efforts
of Jimmy here and cheat.

33:45.231 --> 33:46.330
Or be like Mr. Ramirez

33:46.332 --> 33:49.629
and simply not turn anything in.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.163
Mm-hmm.

33:55.465 --> 33:59.197
Hold up already!
Why are you so pissed off?

33:59.199 --> 34:01.397
She knows I'm the smartest
in the class,

34:01.399 --> 34:03.297
and she knows I failed
on purpose.

34:03.299 --> 34:05.230
Why are you getting
so wound up about Harris?

34:05.232 --> 34:07.197
Because she's trying to do
one of these

34:07.199 --> 34:09.197
reverse "psychologic" things.

34:09.199 --> 34:11.030
Maybe you just
don't like black people.

34:11.032 --> 34:14.197
That's not it, you dummy.

34:14.199 --> 34:15.629
Oh, wait.

34:15.630 --> 34:17.629
You going to call me
something worse?

34:17.630 --> 34:19.563
No, no.
Actually, I take that back.

34:19.565 --> 34:21.030
You're a genius.

34:21.032 --> 34:23.063
Really?
Agnes, could you believe

34:23.065 --> 34:25.463
that your little bit
of misguided lunacy

34:25.465 --> 34:27.163
may actually help me?

34:27.165 --> 34:31.463
So, am I a genius or a loony?
I got to go.

34:31.465 --> 34:33.730
Hey, wait.
Which am I?

35:29.064 --> 35:33.130
For every action there is
an equal and opposite what?

35:33.132 --> 35:34.330
Reaction.

35:34.332 --> 35:36.263
Oh, you can do better.

35:36.265 --> 35:40.030
For every action there
is an equal and opposite what?

35:40.032 --> 35:41.596
Reaction.
All right.

35:45.364 --> 35:48.230
Gilly, would you mind
waiting a moment, please?

35:48.232 --> 35:50.263
Study those vocabulary words
in chapter three,

35:50.265 --> 35:51.330
because there might be

35:51.332 --> 35:54.663
a pop quiz tomorrow, forewarned.

35:54.665 --> 35:57.629
Look it up if you don't know
what it means. Forewarned.

36:28.330 --> 36:30.463
"To miss Harris.

36:37.430 --> 36:40.429
"They say black is beautiful,

36:40.431 --> 36:43.097
"but the best I can figure

36:43.099 --> 36:47.563
is anybody saying that
looks awfully like a..."

36:51.597 --> 36:53.463
A blank space was left.

36:53.465 --> 36:58.030
I'm assuming for me
to finish it, hmm?

36:59.597 --> 37:03.230
Believe it or not, Gilly,
you and I are very much alike.

37:03.232 --> 37:05.197
Mm-hmm.

37:05.199 --> 37:08.396
Both of us are smart
and we know it.

37:08.398 --> 37:12.063
But the thing that brings us
closer than intelligence

37:12.065 --> 37:14.163
is anger.

37:14.165 --> 37:17.997
You and I are two
of the angriest people I know.

37:17.999 --> 37:21.730
Oh, I was always taught
to deny mine,

37:21.732 --> 37:26.097
which I did and still do.

37:26.099 --> 37:28.730
And that makes me envy you.

37:28.732 --> 37:30.730
Mm-hmm.

37:30.732 --> 37:36.197
See, your anger is still
right up here on the surface,

37:36.199 --> 37:40.262
where you can
look it in the face.

37:40.264 --> 37:43.730
Make friends with it, honey.

37:43.732 --> 37:48.030
Channel it for your own design.

37:49.064 --> 37:50.629
Hmm?

37:52.231 --> 37:53.596
But I didn't ask you
to stay after school

37:53.598 --> 37:57.563
to tell you
how intelligent you are

37:57.565 --> 37:58.763
or how much I envy you,

37:58.765 --> 38:01.329
but to thank you for your card.

38:01.331 --> 38:06.763
Oh, Gilly, I took it to the
teacher's lounge at noon...

38:08.464 --> 38:13.496
And cursed creatively
for over 20 minutes.

38:26.731 --> 38:31.396
Oh, I haven't felt so good
in years.

38:31.398 --> 38:32.997
Ah.

38:34.530 --> 38:40.329
So, I will see you tomorrow.

38:40.331 --> 38:43.030
Thanks again.

38:44.297 --> 38:45.730
Thanks, Gilly.

38:51.230 --> 38:53.030
Hey, Gilly.

39:01.597 --> 39:04.229
I need to know how much
a cross-country ticket costs

39:04.231 --> 39:06.763
to San Francisco from Maryland.

39:06.765 --> 39:10.696
<i>One-way to San Francisco,
that'll run you $189.</i>

39:21.064 --> 39:23.730
Trotter and Mr. Randolph
leave yet for the store?

39:23.732 --> 39:26.596
Yeah, and to welfare
to get money.

39:26.598 --> 39:29.097
Mr. Randolph wants me
to do him

39:29.099 --> 39:30.596
a favor while they're out.

39:30.598 --> 39:34.229
Okay, now Randolph
doesn't want Trotter

39:34.231 --> 39:35.529
to know about this.

39:35.531 --> 39:38.196
This is kind of a surprise,

39:38.198 --> 39:39.763
so it'll be our little secret
for now, okay?

39:39.765 --> 39:42.496
Okay.

39:42.498 --> 39:44.063
See up there?

39:44.065 --> 39:45.730
That red book on the shelf?

39:45.732 --> 39:47.329
I can't reach it.

39:47.331 --> 39:49.097
Then we're both going
to have to do it.

39:49.099 --> 39:50.396
Come on.

39:57.497 --> 39:59.563
I still can't reach it.

40:01.597 --> 40:04.663
Okay, I'm getting scared.

40:04.665 --> 40:07.030
Think of how proud
everybody's going to be after,

40:07.032 --> 40:09.229
when the surprise
can be told and everything,

40:09.231 --> 40:11.396
and they found out
who was climbing...

40:11.398 --> 40:12.496
I still can't reach it, though.

40:12.498 --> 40:15.096
I know. Just pull it out.

40:15.098 --> 40:17.063
You have nothing to worry about.

40:17.065 --> 40:18.396
Pow!

40:18.398 --> 40:20.129
Let me see, let me see.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

40:20.131 --> 40:22.196
Whoa! Whoa! Ow!

40:22.198 --> 40:24.229
Stop. Calm down.

40:25.330 --> 40:27.296
Is there any more?

40:29.064 --> 40:30.596
No, I don't think so.

40:30.598 --> 40:33.162
Okay, let's go back down.

40:34.197 --> 40:35.363
Careful.

40:41.764 --> 40:43.563
Oh, you forgot some.

40:45.230 --> 40:47.162
Thank you.
Come on, hurry up.

40:47.164 --> 40:49.363
I'll give the money
to Randolph later.

40:49.365 --> 40:50.629
You can go back to playing.

40:50.631 --> 40:52.596
I got to straighten up my room.

40:52.598 --> 40:56.196
And remember, this is our own
secret surprise.

40:56.198 --> 40:58.162
Our secret, okay.

41:11.597 --> 41:15.162
<i>Twenty-five bucks.</i>

41:15.164 --> 41:17.329
<i>Get my hair torn out,
and I can only get as far</i>

41:17.331 --> 41:19.196
<i>as the Mississippi river.</i>

41:19.198 --> 41:21.596
<i>Brilliant, Gilly.
Just brilliant.</i>

41:37.597 --> 41:39.663
<i>Dear Courtney
Rutherford Hopkins,</i>

41:39.665 --> 41:41.363
<i>I received your card.</i>

41:41.365 --> 41:44.196
<i>I'm sorry to bother you
with my problems,</i>

41:44.198 --> 41:45.496
<i>but as my real mother,</i>

41:45.498 --> 41:47.096
<i>I feel you have
the right to know</i>

41:47.098 --> 41:48.563
<i>about your daughter's situation.</i>

41:51.497 --> 41:53.629
<i>At the present time
I'm very desperate,</i>

41:53.631 --> 41:55.596
<i>or I would not bother you.</i>

41:55.598 --> 41:57.463
Churchill downs event...

41:57.465 --> 42:00.329
<i>The foster mother
is a religious fanatic.</i>

42:00.331 --> 42:03.029
<i>Her house is filthy.</i>

42:03.031 --> 42:04.329
<i>She has weird friends
who show up</i>

42:04.331 --> 42:06.730
<i>at weird hours of the night.</i>

42:06.732 --> 42:09.463
<i>I practically live in a closet</i>

42:09.465 --> 42:11.029
<i>and share
a bug infested bathroom</i>

42:11.031 --> 42:12.463
<i>with another kid here</i>

42:12.465 --> 42:15.029
<i>whom I'm expected
to take care of,</i>

42:15.031 --> 42:17.229
<i>which is very hard
with all my schoolwork,</i>

42:17.231 --> 42:21.162
<i>which is very excessive
from a very mean teacher.</i>

42:26.230 --> 42:28.162
<i>I saved up $65 towards my ticket</i>

42:28.164 --> 42:30.062
<i>to California.</i>

42:30.064 --> 42:33.296
<i>The full cost is $189.</i>

42:33.298 --> 42:36.629
<i>If you can send me the rest,
I'll get a job in California</i>

42:36.631 --> 42:39.196
<i>when I get there
and pay you back.</i>

42:39.198 --> 42:41.996
<i>I'm very smart and I can
take care of myself,</i>

42:41.998 --> 42:45.129
<i>so I will not be a burden
to you in any way.</i>

42:45.131 --> 42:49.496
<i>Yours sincerely, your loving
daughter, Galadriel Hopkins.</i>

43:19.430 --> 43:21.696
There's a sweet car in front
of Mr. Randolph's house.

43:21.698 --> 43:23.196
Yeah.

43:23.198 --> 43:24.696
Mr. Randolph won't be
joining us tonight.

43:24.698 --> 43:28.096
His son's in town,
cleaning up his daddy's place.

43:29.531 --> 43:33.029
Some of those rooms
haven't been touched in years.

43:48.597 --> 43:51.363
He's going to find out
I stole the money.

43:51.365 --> 43:53.596
He's calling the cops right now.

44:03.764 --> 44:05.563
I, uh...

44:05.565 --> 44:08.096
I just got to take some stuff
over to Agnes's.

44:08.098 --> 44:09.529
Don't go.
I'm not.

44:09.531 --> 44:11.730
Don't tell Trotter.
This is part of our secret.

45:18.330 --> 45:21.596
Thanks, Agnes.

45:21.598 --> 45:24.463
You're, like,
really brave or crazy.

45:24.465 --> 45:26.663
The crazy one calling me crazy.

45:26.665 --> 45:28.463
That's crazy.

45:30.764 --> 45:34.463
Thanks for pretending
to be my friend.

46:05.297 --> 46:06.629
Yeah?

46:06.631 --> 46:08.496
Ticket to San Francisco, please.

46:08.498 --> 46:10.496
Round trip?

46:10.498 --> 46:12.229
No, one way.

46:14.464 --> 46:16.396
Are you here by yourself?

46:16.398 --> 46:18.762
Me? Uh...

46:18.764 --> 46:21.663
No.

46:21.665 --> 46:24.762
My mother's over there.
She doesn't speak English.

46:24.764 --> 46:27.196
Dad's second wife.

46:27.198 --> 46:30.429
She already has her ticket.
She needs me to get mine.

46:30.431 --> 46:33.429
I can't wait
to ride a cable car.

46:33.431 --> 46:35.229
Computer's down.

46:35.231 --> 46:37.496
It's going to probably take me
a couple of minutes.

46:37.498 --> 46:39.129
Oh, okay.

46:45.230 --> 46:47.062
You going on a long trip, honey.

46:47.064 --> 46:50.262
You might want to take a look
at those books over there.

46:50.264 --> 46:52.162
I don't read books.

46:52.164 --> 46:53.663
It's a shame.

46:53.665 --> 46:56.029
Not many people do anymore.

47:13.664 --> 47:15.262
Crap.

47:19.230 --> 47:21.296
Never, never, never!
I need you

47:21.298 --> 47:22.296
to calm down, miss Trotter.

47:22.298 --> 47:23.596
No one is blaming you.

47:23.598 --> 47:25.463
There is no indication
of failure on your part.

47:25.465 --> 47:27.096
I mean, I never...

47:27.098 --> 47:29.229
I never thought Gilly
would be a flight risk.

47:29.231 --> 47:30.729
She's never done this before.

47:30.731 --> 47:32.262
She's just a little mixed up,
that's all.

47:32.264 --> 47:33.529
Look, miss Trotter,

47:33.531 --> 47:36.329
you've been
a terrific assistance

47:36.331 --> 47:38.096
to the program for years now.

47:38.098 --> 47:39.529
I think maybe it's time.
I'm not letting her go.

47:39.531 --> 47:42.229
Then if you're not
going to think for yourself,

47:42.231 --> 47:44.363
I think maybe we should think
of William Ernest.

47:44.365 --> 47:45.762
He's come too far.
William Ernest

47:45.764 --> 47:48.029
was the one who told me
that she'd left.

47:48.031 --> 47:50.062
He wants her back.
Yes, because...

47:50.064 --> 47:51.996
Probably because he saw
how upset you were.

47:51.998 --> 47:54.029
Oh, come on.
Yeah, I'm sorry.

47:54.031 --> 47:55.396
He's a very sensitive child,

47:55.398 --> 47:56.762
and that's even more of a reason

47:56.764 --> 47:58.229
to remove this damaging...

47:58.231 --> 47:59.463
William Ernest has been with me

47:59.465 --> 48:01.429
for going on nearly
a year and a half.

48:01.431 --> 48:03.596
He's going to make it.
I know he will.

48:03.598 --> 48:05.762
Sometimes, Mr. Ellis,

48:05.764 --> 48:09.563
you have to walk on your heel
to favor your toe,

48:09.565 --> 48:11.096
even though you know your heel's

48:11.098 --> 48:12.463
going to get a little sore.

48:12.465 --> 48:15.096
Well, somebody's
got to favor Gilly.

48:15.098 --> 48:17.363
She's long overdue,

48:17.365 --> 48:19.996
and I am not going to add
my name to the list of people

48:19.998 --> 48:21.563
who failed her.

48:21.565 --> 48:24.229
God knows I just about died
when I found out she'd gone.

48:24.231 --> 48:28.729
Be honest, should we consider
a change, maybe for both kids?

48:28.731 --> 48:30.662
Both?
Yes.

48:38.730 --> 48:41.196
We were just discussing
the present situation,

48:41.198 --> 48:42.996
which is not a good one.

48:42.998 --> 48:44.729
And I was explaining

48:44.731 --> 48:46.496
how sometimes children
make mistakes.

48:46.498 --> 48:48.762
Too many, in my opinion.
And Mr. Ellis, you know,

48:48.764 --> 48:51.329
he was... he's willing
to give you another chance.

48:51.331 --> 48:53.262
Actually...
With Thanksgiving

48:53.264 --> 48:56.062
coming and everything,
and the holidays.

48:56.064 --> 48:57.595
The holidays should not...

48:57.597 --> 49:00.363
If you'd like to stay here
with me and William Ernest,

49:00.365 --> 49:01.628
well, that's just fine.

49:01.630 --> 49:03.096
What about my real mother?

49:03.098 --> 49:05.562
She wants me
to come to California.

49:05.564 --> 49:07.196
If you're referring
to the postcard,

49:07.198 --> 49:08.695
that's the first one
in three or four years.

49:08.697 --> 49:10.762
If your mother really
wanted you there with her...

49:10.764 --> 49:12.662
She's different this time.
I know it.

49:12.664 --> 49:14.496
She's waiting for me.
She wants me to come.

49:14.498 --> 49:16.129
She said so.

49:25.497 --> 49:27.463
If she'd known you...

49:28.663 --> 49:31.196
If she "knowed"
what a girl she has,

49:31.198 --> 49:33.562
she'd be here in a minute.

49:37.529 --> 49:39.162
The police said you had

49:39.164 --> 49:41.262
well over a $100 with you
at the bus station.

49:41.264 --> 49:45.628
I have trouble believing
that was your own money.

49:45.630 --> 49:48.729
So, I call taking
someone else's money stealing.

49:48.731 --> 49:51.096
So do we, Mr. Ellis.

49:51.098 --> 49:53.029
Surely you don't think
this is the first time

49:53.031 --> 49:54.396
something like this has happened

49:54.398 --> 49:55.595
to me over 20 years?

49:55.597 --> 49:57.562
No, not at all.
Well, then how about

49:57.564 --> 50:00.096
trusting me to handle it?
It's not you I don't trust.

50:00.098 --> 50:01.562
I need to hear it from Gilly.

50:04.529 --> 50:06.496
Can I trust you?

50:10.763 --> 50:12.196
Yes.

50:13.230 --> 50:16.329
Miss Trotter,

50:16.331 --> 50:18.495
against my better judgment,

50:18.497 --> 50:21.363
I will wait
till after Thanksgiving.

50:21.365 --> 50:24.096
But after that we will
revisit this, understand?

50:48.496 --> 50:51.562
I sure wish Trotter
reacted like you did.

50:51.564 --> 50:53.762
She's made up this huge chart
for chores

50:53.764 --> 50:54.762
to make up for the money I spent

50:54.764 --> 50:56.495
on food and junk I bought.

50:56.497 --> 50:59.363
For housework, I get paid
a measly 25 cents an hour.

50:59.365 --> 51:01.129
That's slave labor.

51:02.997 --> 51:06.429
Oh, sorry about
that slave thing.

51:06.431 --> 51:08.429
I believe that miss Trotter

51:08.431 --> 51:10.363
feels that the payment
should equate

51:10.365 --> 51:11.595
with the punishment.

51:11.597 --> 51:13.595
If she pays you a lot,

51:13.597 --> 51:16.162
it wouldn't feel
like punishment, would it?

51:18.197 --> 51:20.462
Yeah, I guess.

51:22.163 --> 51:23.562
But you know what?

51:23.564 --> 51:26.562
For 75 cents an hour,
I could help W.E.

51:26.564 --> 51:28.428
With his schoolwork.

51:28.430 --> 51:31.029
And naturally I'd be spending
a lot more time with W.E.

51:31.031 --> 51:32.528
Naturally.

51:46.097 --> 51:48.062
It's just the broom, goofy.

51:50.663 --> 51:53.595
Listen, what are you going
to do when somebody socks you?

51:53.597 --> 51:56.528
I'm not going to hit you, silly.

51:56.530 --> 51:57.562
Are you going to go through life

51:57.564 --> 51:59.762
letting people pick on you?

51:59.764 --> 52:03.329
I'm going to teach you
how to fight.

52:03.331 --> 52:04.762
You hear about how
I fought six boys

52:04.764 --> 52:06.395
at school all by myself?

52:06.397 --> 52:08.329
Well, before I get through
with you,

52:08.331 --> 52:10.129
you're going to do
the same thing.

52:10.131 --> 52:13.762
So, first thing,
when somebody yells at you,

52:13.764 --> 52:15.296
you got to stand tall.

52:15.298 --> 52:18.062
See, they might not even
want to hit you.

52:18.064 --> 52:21.162
Stand tall,
take a deep breath and say,

52:21.164 --> 52:22.996
"get the hell
out of my way!"

52:22.998 --> 52:24.428
Try it.

52:25.763 --> 52:28.029
Hell's my way.

52:28.031 --> 52:30.595
No, just follow me.

52:31.629 --> 52:33.329
Get the...
Get the...

52:33.331 --> 52:34.628
hell...
Hell...

52:34.630 --> 52:36.662
out of my way!
Out of my way.

52:36.664 --> 52:38.428
Now yell it like you mean it,

52:38.430 --> 52:41.729
louder than you've ever
yelled in your life.

52:41.731 --> 52:45.062
Get the hell out my way!

52:45.064 --> 52:47.162
Trotter, I'm not going to teach
him how to push on people,

52:47.164 --> 52:49.162
just how to stand up
for himself.

52:49.164 --> 52:50.395
If he knows how to read

52:50.397 --> 52:51.428
and how to stick up for himself,

52:51.430 --> 52:52.628
he'll be okay.

52:52.630 --> 52:55.362
Oh.

52:55.364 --> 52:57.495
Oh, I know you don't
allow kissing,

52:57.497 --> 53:00.628
but sometimes I just haul off
and go crazy.

53:00.630 --> 53:02.996
Don't worry about it.

53:02.998 --> 53:04.595
Come on, W.E.

53:04.597 --> 53:06.628
Next time I'm going to teach you

53:06.630 --> 53:08.129
a shin kick.

53:12.596 --> 53:14.562
Hey.

53:14.564 --> 53:16.229
I'm not doing
extra credit anymore.

53:16.231 --> 53:17.462
Yeah, I know.

53:19.496 --> 53:23.762
I just wanted to say thank you
for helping me catch up,

53:23.764 --> 53:28.362
not that I'm ever
going to use it, the math.

53:28.364 --> 53:30.595
But thanks anyway.

53:34.329 --> 53:35.729
You're welcome.

53:49.363 --> 53:51.062
Mr. Randolph?

53:53.063 --> 53:54.328
Hello?

53:57.230 --> 54:02.029
I'm sorry, miss Gilly,
is it suppertime already?

54:02.031 --> 54:03.662
Yeah.

54:06.130 --> 54:07.729
Are you okay?

54:07.731 --> 54:10.395
Oh, I'm all right.

54:10.397 --> 54:12.996
Just a little under the weather,

54:12.998 --> 54:14.395
I guess.

54:16.030 --> 54:18.328
Who's that?

54:18.330 --> 54:22.695
This was my wonderful wife
of 44 years.

54:22.697 --> 54:25.096
When I first met miss Mary,

54:25.098 --> 54:28.362
she was a dancer
in a burlesque club.

54:28.364 --> 54:29.695
She was a stripper?

54:29.697 --> 54:32.662
No. Exotic dancer.

54:32.664 --> 54:35.229
It was a little different
back then.

54:38.030 --> 54:41.228
She was pretty.

54:41.230 --> 54:42.695
She was my world.

54:44.596 --> 54:48.562
Today is our anniversary.

54:48.564 --> 54:50.762
Oh.

54:50.764 --> 54:53.462
I know what you're thinking.

54:53.464 --> 54:56.428
What's a crazy,
old blind man doing

54:56.430 --> 54:59.528
staring at a picture
he can't see?

55:02.229 --> 55:05.062
But I can.

55:05.064 --> 55:07.495
See, as my eyesight
was going out

55:07.497 --> 55:09.562
I looked at this picture
every night

55:09.564 --> 55:11.195
before I went to bed.

55:13.097 --> 55:16.228
I know this picture
better than I know myself.

55:18.229 --> 55:21.261
I'm missing her
a little bit today.

55:52.696 --> 55:56.528
I got sick. Sorry.

55:56.530 --> 55:58.762
You didn't do anything wrong.

55:58.764 --> 56:01.096
I didn't get all of it
in the potty.

56:01.098 --> 56:04.528
Looks like you got most of it.
Come on.

56:08.097 --> 56:10.029
Watch it, watch it.

56:10.031 --> 56:11.309
Come on, let's get you into bed.

56:12.763 --> 56:16.462
Gilly, are you going
to run again?

56:19.262 --> 56:20.428
No.

56:25.396 --> 56:27.362
Good night.

56:57.563 --> 57:00.462
I heard noise downstairs.

57:00.464 --> 57:02.462
It was just me
doing some laundry.

57:02.464 --> 57:05.395
Gilly, honey, sweetie, baby,

57:05.397 --> 57:06.462
what's gotten into your sweet,

57:06.464 --> 57:07.729
little darling head

57:07.731 --> 57:10.362
to do the laundry
at this godforsaken hour?

57:10.364 --> 57:12.762
I don't know Trotter,
honey, sugar, baby.

57:12.764 --> 57:15.295
Maybe I just felt like getting
some cleaning done.

57:16.363 --> 57:17.996
Sweet dreams, honey.

57:17.998 --> 57:20.195
Right back at you, sugarplum.

58:01.596 --> 58:03.462
Galadriel?

58:05.229 --> 58:07.762
Galadriel Hopkins?

58:07.764 --> 58:09.595
Who wants to know?

58:13.162 --> 58:14.595
I'm your grandmother.

58:19.062 --> 58:21.395
May I come in?

58:22.429 --> 58:25.028
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

58:39.696 --> 58:42.161
I am right, aren't I?

58:42.163 --> 58:44.362
You are Galadriel?

58:47.596 --> 58:49.462
I brought you this pie.

58:55.429 --> 58:59.328
Courtney, your mother,
left home.

59:01.229 --> 59:02.362
Well...

59:04.296 --> 59:06.228
She... she and I were...

59:06.230 --> 59:09.061
It was...
It was a difficult time.

59:09.063 --> 59:10.328
I never...

59:11.363 --> 59:13.562
It was just...

59:13.564 --> 59:16.528
Oh, I'm not doing very well
with this, am I?

59:18.696 --> 59:23.528
Your grandfather died
nearly 12 years ago.

59:23.530 --> 59:26.195
I tried to contact
your mother at the time,

59:26.197 --> 59:28.495
but I was unable to.

59:28.497 --> 59:31.729
And then I got a letter.

59:31.731 --> 59:36.662
A letter that was the first
direct word from Courtney

59:36.664 --> 59:38.695
in over 13 years.

59:40.363 --> 59:45.762
I didn't even know
that she had a baby.

59:45.764 --> 59:48.395
I can't imagine her not telling

59:48.397 --> 59:50.662
her father and mother
something like that.

59:54.062 --> 59:59.128
Gilly, I called you
and called you.

59:59.130 --> 01:00:00.362
I wet.

01:00:00.364 --> 01:00:01.995
Oh, it's okay.

01:00:01.997 --> 01:00:04.061
I couldn't help it.

01:00:04.063 --> 01:00:08.028
I know, buddy. When you're
sick you just can't help it.

01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:10.195
Come on, I'll help you
change, okay?

01:00:12.763 --> 01:00:15.395
Get the hell out my way.

01:00:16.763 --> 01:00:18.462
Excuse us for a second.

01:00:29.363 --> 01:00:32.161
I'm... I'm very sorry.
I'll... I'll be right back.

01:00:48.696 --> 01:00:50.228
What? What is it?
Oh!

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:52.028
What was that?
Galadriel?

01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:53.328
Galadriel!
Miss Gilly!

01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:54.595
Galadriel!
Miss Gilly!

01:00:56.429 --> 01:00:59.095
Mr. Randolph, it's okay.

01:00:59.097 --> 01:01:01.595
I'm... I'm...
I'm right here.

01:01:01.597 --> 01:01:03.528
Nothing to worry about.

01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:07.261
Just lie back down
and get your rest, okay?

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:11.462
Gilly, honey, have you got
company down there?

01:01:11.464 --> 01:01:13.061
No, no.

01:01:13.063 --> 01:01:14.562
Go back to bed, Trotter.

01:01:14.564 --> 01:01:18.362
Bless you, child,
you poor thing.

01:01:18.364 --> 01:01:20.562
How could they have put you
in place like this?

01:01:20.564 --> 01:01:24.362
This? No, no, it's just
that everyone's got the flu.

01:01:24.364 --> 01:01:27.195
Not me, but it's...
It's not always like this.

01:01:27.197 --> 01:01:28.428
You know, the mess and all.

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.595
Trotter normally keeps it clean.

01:01:30.597 --> 01:01:34.628
Lord, I forgot.

01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:36.695
I forgot the Turkey.
No, it's fine.

01:01:36.697 --> 01:01:38.729
I've got everything
under control.

01:01:38.731 --> 01:01:41.061
You go back to bed, and the
Turkey's already in the oven.

01:01:41.063 --> 01:01:42.395
Oh!
It's all good.

01:01:42.397 --> 01:01:45.428
I got to... I got to...
I got to sit down.

01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:47.028
No, Trotter...
No, no, no.

01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:49.328
My head is spinning.

01:01:51.163 --> 01:01:53.628
Whoo! I done it now.
I "squisheded" you, see.

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:54.695
Roll over!

01:01:54.697 --> 01:01:56.295
Oh, my god.

01:01:56.297 --> 01:01:57.762
Oh, poor little Gilly.

01:01:57.764 --> 01:02:00.495
Let me get my legs
underneath me.

01:02:00.497 --> 01:02:02.628
Oh, lord, help me.

01:02:07.229 --> 01:02:08.729
I thought you said
there was nobody here.

01:02:08.731 --> 01:02:12.095
This is just a woman
who used to live here.

01:02:12.097 --> 01:02:13.595
I was just leaving.

01:02:13.597 --> 01:02:17.128
I... I see that
it's not a good time.

01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:18.428
No, obviously not.

01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:20.628
Okay, Trotter,
you can go back to bed,

01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:23.061
and I'll be up to check on you.

01:02:23.063 --> 01:02:25.729
And dinner will be ready
in an hour.

01:02:25.731 --> 01:02:28.528
Give her a cookie.

01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:29.529
Sure.

01:02:31.762 --> 01:02:33.628
Don't you worry.

01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:37.095
I am so, so sorry
about all this.

01:02:37.097 --> 01:02:39.562
I will get you out of here.

01:02:39.564 --> 01:02:41.662
I promise you, I will.

01:02:52.162 --> 01:02:54.595
Or we could go to my house
and call people on the phone

01:02:54.597 --> 01:02:55.729
and breathe weird.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:57.261
It really wigs them out.

01:02:57.263 --> 01:03:00.028
It's dumb, Agnes.
Dumb, dumb, dumb.

01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:03.128
Oh, come on, Gilly,
let's do something.

01:03:03.130 --> 01:03:05.095
You ain't done nothing
with me for a long time.

01:03:05.097 --> 01:03:07.161
But I've been busy.
My family's been sick.

01:03:07.163 --> 01:03:08.595
Oh, please.

01:03:08.597 --> 01:03:11.161
My brother, my mother,
and my uncle were sick.

01:03:11.163 --> 01:03:12.595
I've been taking care of them.

01:03:12.597 --> 01:03:14.362
You got a black uncle?

01:03:14.364 --> 01:03:15.628
Yes, I do.

01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:17.295
And me too.

01:03:17.297 --> 01:03:19.628
It's too dumb
to even talk about.

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:21.495
See you tomorrow, Gilly.

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:23.095
Bye.

01:03:23.097 --> 01:03:24.995
I bet I could beat her up.

01:03:24.997 --> 01:03:26.662
It wouldn't be fair,

01:03:26.664 --> 01:03:29.061
you against a little puny thing.

01:03:37.096 --> 01:03:38.161
Hi, mom.

01:03:40.596 --> 01:03:42.495
What's the matter?

01:03:42.497 --> 01:03:44.662
Come inside, honey.

01:03:49.363 --> 01:03:52.595
Please, Gilly.
Come inside.

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:57.395
I have some very cool news
for you, Gilly.

01:03:57.397 --> 01:03:58.528
My mother's coming?

01:03:58.530 --> 01:03:59.694
No.

01:03:59.696 --> 01:04:01.195
No, not exactly.

01:04:01.197 --> 01:04:02.761
Your mother is still
in California.

01:04:02.763 --> 01:04:06.528
But your grandmother,
your mom's mom,

01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:08.095
called the office this morning,

01:04:08.097 --> 01:04:10.462
and she wants you to move in
with her permanently.

01:04:10.464 --> 01:04:12.128
I don't even know her.

01:04:12.130 --> 01:04:15.095
Your mom wants you to go too.
I talked to her about it.

01:04:15.097 --> 01:04:16.595
You didn't talk to my mom.
You're lying.

01:04:16.597 --> 01:04:18.295
No, I'm not.

01:04:18.297 --> 01:04:19.495
Then let me talk to her.

01:04:19.497 --> 01:04:21.528
Gilly, it doesn't work that way.

01:04:23.496 --> 01:04:25.061
They can't make me go.

01:04:25.063 --> 01:04:26.228
Yes, Gilly, they can.

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:28.095
Trotter won't let them take me.

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:30.728
Will you, Trotter?

01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:32.694
Trotter?

01:04:32.696 --> 01:04:35.195
You said you'd never let me go.

01:04:35.197 --> 01:04:37.595
I heard you.
"Never, never, never."

01:04:37.597 --> 01:04:39.028
That's what you said.

01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:40.195
Don't cry, Gilly.

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:44.595
I'm not crying, I'm yelling.

01:04:47.229 --> 01:04:50.694
It's going to be okay.
Right, Trotter?

01:04:52.396 --> 01:04:55.061
You tell the child
what's got to be done.

01:04:55.063 --> 01:04:56.228
Come on, W.

01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:57.362
Gilly...

01:05:03.229 --> 01:05:04.295
You seem to have changed

01:05:04.297 --> 01:05:07.761
your mind about a lot of things.

01:05:07.763 --> 01:05:10.295
Why? Why did you write
that letter?

01:05:10.297 --> 01:05:11.495
You won't understand.
I think I do,

01:05:11.497 --> 01:05:12.562
but why you won't learn

01:05:12.564 --> 01:05:16.161
from your mistakes is beyond me.

01:05:16.163 --> 01:05:17.562
You couldn't have done
a more brilliant job

01:05:17.564 --> 01:05:18.694
of screwing this up
for yourself.

01:05:18.696 --> 01:05:22.228
I mean... jeez, Gilly!

01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:23.627
You could have stayed here.

01:05:23.629 --> 01:05:26.594
You could have stayed here
indefinitely.

01:05:26.596 --> 01:05:28.728
They're both crazy about you.

01:05:30.096 --> 01:05:31.594
I... I can't fix this.

01:05:31.596 --> 01:05:34.761
That... that letter you wrote,
it did some serious damage.

01:05:34.763 --> 01:05:37.495
And not just for you.
It affected all of us.

01:05:37.497 --> 01:05:40.061
Me, Trotter, and even W.E.

01:05:40.063 --> 01:05:42.362
Yes, the agency is considering

01:05:42.364 --> 01:05:45.362
removing William Ernest
from Mrs. Trotter's care.

01:05:45.364 --> 01:05:47.028
Why?
You made some

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:49.428
serious accusations of abuse
and conditions of this home.

01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:50.528
They can't ignore it

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:51.995
when a foster mother...
I lied!

01:05:51.997 --> 01:05:53.395
Is a religious fanatic...
Not true.

01:05:53.397 --> 01:05:54.728
Strangers coming
and going at night,

01:05:54.730 --> 01:05:57.728
forced to live in a closet...
All of it, okay!

01:05:57.730 --> 01:05:59.694
I lied about all of it!

01:05:59.696 --> 01:06:02.028
None of it's true!

01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:03.561
Why would anybody believe me?

01:06:03.563 --> 01:06:05.761
I'm nobody.
I'm bad, I know it.

01:06:05.763 --> 01:06:08.095
But please don't hurt Trotter. You
are not bad, but this is my job.

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:09.694
My hands are tied.
Please don't hurt W.E.!

01:06:09.696 --> 01:06:11.362
My boss got a copy
of this letter,

01:06:11.364 --> 01:06:13.328
and there are consequences.

01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:15.362
Do whatever you want with me.

01:06:15.364 --> 01:06:17.261
I'll do whatever you want.

01:06:17.263 --> 01:06:21.061
But please,
please don't hurt my family.

01:06:24.628 --> 01:06:26.395
All right.

01:06:28.429 --> 01:06:30.661
All right,
I'll see what I can do.

01:06:35.695 --> 01:06:39.128
Your grandmother is coming
to my office tomorrow.

01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:41.095
I'll be by around 9:00
to pick you up.

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:43.095
Tomorrow?
Yes.

01:06:43.097 --> 01:06:44.995
Believe me,
it's better this way.

01:06:44.997 --> 01:06:46.561
Waiting around is no good
in these situations.

01:06:46.563 --> 01:06:47.627
But I got school.

01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:50.295
They will forward your records.

01:06:54.562 --> 01:06:57.395
I understand from miss Harris
you've done quite well.

01:07:01.628 --> 01:07:04.395
I have to admit,
last month when you ran away,

01:07:04.397 --> 01:07:08.228
I thought,
"here we go again."

01:07:11.096 --> 01:07:13.161
But I was wrong.

01:07:15.396 --> 01:07:18.061
You've done well here.

01:07:58.062 --> 01:07:59.661
If y'all don't start
eating this supper,

01:07:59.663 --> 01:08:01.261
I'm going to jump up and down
on this table

01:08:01.263 --> 01:08:03.561
squawking like
a 200-pound lovesick chicken.

01:08:03.563 --> 01:08:05.395
Really?

01:08:17.662 --> 01:08:19.493
That's a little better.

01:08:19.496 --> 01:08:22.728
This is supposed to be a party,
not some kind of funeral.

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:25.261
Come on, now.
We got to get rid of this food.

01:08:25.263 --> 01:08:28.527
Gilly's folks are from
Loudoun county, Mr. Randolph.

01:08:28.529 --> 01:08:30.728
Loudoun county, miss Gilly?

01:08:30.729 --> 01:08:33.694
Oh, that's a lovely country.

01:08:33.696 --> 01:08:36.461
We come and see
your country, Gilly?

01:08:36.462 --> 01:08:39.228
When folks leave,
William Ernest, honey,

01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:41.261
you got to give them a chance
to settle in.

01:08:41.263 --> 01:08:44.261
Sometimes it's best
not to go visiting right away.

01:08:44.263 --> 01:08:45.694
Never?

01:08:47.129 --> 01:08:50.728
Miss Gilly,

01:08:50.729 --> 01:08:54.194
I wasn't quite sure
when to give this to you.

01:08:55.229 --> 01:08:57.362
But I...

01:08:57.363 --> 01:08:59.328
I want you to have it.

01:09:05.095 --> 01:09:07.361
We all signed our names
in it for you.

01:09:35.261 --> 01:09:38.295
Gilly, honey, can I come in?

01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:57.028
I know I'm not supposed
to let on how I feel.

01:09:58.229 --> 01:10:00.228
I got no blood claim on you.

01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:04.028
And it's killing me
to let you go.

01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:08.161
I'm not going to go.
They can't make me.

01:10:08.163 --> 01:10:10.661
No, baby, you got to go.

01:10:10.663 --> 01:10:13.361
And lord forgive me
for making it harder on you.

01:10:18.162 --> 01:10:19.661
I'll come back.

01:10:19.663 --> 01:10:24.095
I'll come back and see you
all the time.

01:10:25.363 --> 01:10:27.561
No, baby,
that's not how it works.

01:10:30.362 --> 01:10:33.494
It's like I was trying
to tell you at supper.

01:10:33.496 --> 01:10:35.095
Once you get on that old tugboat

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:36.995
and it takes you
out to the ocean liner,

01:10:36.997 --> 01:10:40.161
you got to get
all the way onboard.

01:10:40.163 --> 01:10:43.095
You can't straddle both decks.

01:10:43.097 --> 01:10:44.728
I could.

01:10:47.562 --> 01:10:51.028
You are going to make me proud.

01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:52.294
I know you will.

01:11:07.295 --> 01:11:09.527
Would you like for me
to turn on the radio?

01:11:09.529 --> 01:11:13.728
I don't mind,
as long as it's not too loud.

01:11:17.228 --> 01:11:20.694
Mr. Ellis seems like
a nice person.

01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:26.394
He thinks I may have gotten
the wrong impression

01:11:26.396 --> 01:11:30.227
of the foster home
he put you in.

01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:32.294
They were all sick last week.

01:11:32.296 --> 01:11:34.095
Oh.

01:11:34.097 --> 01:11:36.327
He tried to tell me that you
really like living there,

01:11:36.329 --> 01:11:39.327
despite everything.

01:11:39.329 --> 01:11:41.195
From your letter, i...

01:11:41.197 --> 01:11:42.494
I lie a lot.

01:11:50.595 --> 01:11:53.194
I'd hoped you'd be happy
to come with me.

01:12:20.595 --> 01:12:23.128
And in here
is your mother's room.

01:12:24.595 --> 01:12:28.061
You can rearrange it
however you want.

01:12:28.063 --> 01:12:30.561
I also thought maybe
you would like a computer,

01:12:30.563 --> 01:12:33.327
so you can stay in touch
with your friends.

01:13:03.495 --> 01:13:04.527
What's this room?

01:13:05.762 --> 01:13:08.061
This was Chadwell's room.

01:13:09.562 --> 01:13:12.627
Your mother's brother.

01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:13.661
He was your uncle.

01:13:15.495 --> 01:13:18.127
We lost him in a war.

01:13:18.129 --> 01:13:20.028
Can I have this room?

01:13:22.128 --> 01:13:24.061
Sure, if you like.

01:13:49.128 --> 01:13:51.294
Would you care for some salad?

01:13:51.296 --> 01:13:52.461
No.

01:14:02.362 --> 01:14:05.394
I hope you don't mind the music.

01:14:05.396 --> 01:14:07.160
When you're by yourself,

01:14:07.162 --> 01:14:10.461
sometimes the last thing you
want to listen to is silence.

01:14:25.195 --> 01:14:28.361
Do you like your new computer?

01:14:28.363 --> 01:14:30.661
I'm not very familiar with them,

01:14:30.663 --> 01:14:32.694
but the man at the store
said that he thought

01:14:32.696 --> 01:14:34.661
that was the right one for you.

01:14:34.663 --> 01:14:36.661
I haven't turned it on.

01:14:36.663 --> 01:14:41.294
Ah, well, there's time for that.

01:14:46.095 --> 01:14:50.627
Monday you're supposed
to start school,

01:14:50.629 --> 01:14:52.761
but perhaps you'd like
to stay here another day

01:14:52.763 --> 01:14:56.227
and get used
to your new surroundings.

01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:59.661
Might as well get it over with.

01:14:59.663 --> 01:15:02.627
Can I be excused?
I'm not very hungry.

01:15:02.629 --> 01:15:04.060
Yes.

01:15:26.562 --> 01:15:29.694
Miss Hopkins,
it's been some time

01:15:29.696 --> 01:15:31.661
since we've seen you
around here.

01:15:31.663 --> 01:15:36.327
Yes, I just want to make sure
that my granddaughter

01:15:36.329 --> 01:15:39.427
has a proper introduction
to her new school.

01:15:39.429 --> 01:15:42.728
Your granddaughter?
Yes, Margaret.

01:15:42.730 --> 01:15:46.027
This is my granddaughter
Galadriel Hopkins.

01:15:48.228 --> 01:15:50.227
Hopkins?
Yes.

01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:51.994
She's Courtney's child.

01:15:53.695 --> 01:15:55.361
Hi.

01:15:55.363 --> 01:15:58.327
I didn't even know
Courtney was married.

01:15:58.329 --> 01:15:59.728
She wasn't.

01:16:02.128 --> 01:16:03.494
I see.

01:16:03.496 --> 01:16:06.160
Hopkins.

01:16:06.162 --> 01:16:10.494
Now, how do you spell
her Christian name?

01:16:13.662 --> 01:16:14.661
G.

01:16:16.295 --> 01:16:17.627
A.

01:16:18.762 --> 01:16:20.327
L.

01:16:22.462 --> 01:16:24.194
A.

01:16:26.228 --> 01:16:27.494
D.

01:16:27.496 --> 01:16:30.494
Am I going too fast,
for you dear?

01:16:30.496 --> 01:16:34.160
No. Not at all.

01:16:35.562 --> 01:16:38.194
R, I, e, l.

01:16:38.196 --> 01:16:41.627
Her school records
will be sent to you directly.

01:16:41.629 --> 01:16:44.661
You will see
that she is extremely bright.

01:16:46.562 --> 01:16:52.027
Well, we are looking forward
to having a new Hopkins

01:16:52.029 --> 01:16:56.227
join our ranks, I'm sure.

01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:58.361
So am I.

01:17:27.128 --> 01:17:30.327
Gilly, you've got a package.

01:17:58.228 --> 01:18:00.160
"Dear William Ernest,

01:18:00.162 --> 01:18:03.327
"I told you
I wouldn't forget you.

01:18:03.329 --> 01:18:04.694
<i>"I'm good here at the farm,</i>

01:18:04.696 --> 01:18:06.227
<i>"but miss you all.</i>

01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:08.094
<i>"They train horses to race here.</i>

01:18:08.096 --> 01:18:10.561
<i>"My favorite one is called
clouds of glory.</i>

01:18:10.563 --> 01:18:12.227
<i>"Can you believe that?</i>

01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:14.194
<i>"I know she'll win
a lot of races.</i>

01:18:14.196 --> 01:18:16.461
<i>"They're not our horses.</i>

01:18:16.463 --> 01:18:18.694
<i>"Nonnie rents out
the barn and the land.</i>

01:18:18.696 --> 01:18:22.594
<i>"But there's a horse,
a real pretty one, and fast,</i>

01:18:22.596 --> 01:18:24.594
<i>"that I call clouds of glory.</i>

01:18:24.596 --> 01:18:26.694
<i>I don't actually know
her real name."</i>

01:18:26.696 --> 01:18:29.094
<i>"Dear miss Harris,</i>

01:18:29.096 --> 01:18:31.627
<i>"thank you for the letter and
the Tolkien books you sent me.</i>

01:18:31.629 --> 01:18:35.094
<i>"They're very exciting.
I now know who Galadriel was.</i>

01:18:35.096 --> 01:18:37.494
<i>"If anyone told me
that I'd miss a teacher,</i>

01:18:37.496 --> 01:18:39.027
<i>"I'd never believe it.</i>

01:18:39.029 --> 01:18:40.594
<i>"School here stinks.</i>

01:18:40.596 --> 01:18:43.094
<i>"None of the teachers here
are as smart as you.</i>

01:18:43.096 --> 01:18:45.527
<i>"Your former student,
Gilly Hopkins.</i>

01:18:45.529 --> 01:18:47.461
<i>P.S., you can call me
Galadriel."</i>

01:18:50.128 --> 01:18:51.761
<i>What up, player?</i>

01:18:51.763 --> 01:18:53.594
<i>Hey!
Shut up.</i>

01:18:53.596 --> 01:18:56.327
<i>Anyway, you know Clark Gibbons,</i>

01:18:56.329 --> 01:18:58.027
<i>the kid who smells like
banana fart?</i>

01:18:58.029 --> 01:18:59.461
<i>Well, he's dating...
If you can call it that...</i>

01:18:59.463 --> 01:19:00.627
<i>Melanie smart.</i>

01:19:00.629 --> 01:19:02.461
<i>And...
Let me, Taj.</i>

01:19:02.463 --> 01:19:04.294
<i>You know it's raj.
Whatever.</i>

01:19:04.296 --> 01:19:05.994
<i>Don't "whatever" my name.</i>

01:19:13.629 --> 01:19:15.227
<i>"Dear Gilly.</i>

01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:17.194
<i>"Guess who got in a fight.</i>

01:19:17.196 --> 01:19:19.160
<i>Our quiet little pumpkin,
W.E."</i>

01:19:19.162 --> 01:19:21.494
Battle scar!

01:19:21.496 --> 01:19:23.094
<i>"He got a little busted up,</i>

01:19:23.096 --> 01:19:25.227
<i>"but he's going to be all right.</i>

01:19:25.229 --> 01:19:26.728
<i>"Thank you for writing, darling.</i>

01:19:26.730 --> 01:19:28.260
<i>"Bless you out there.</i>

01:19:28.262 --> 01:19:30.361
<i>I hope you get
everything you want."</i>

01:19:39.996 --> 01:19:41.727
All right.

01:19:41.729 --> 01:19:44.361
Mm-hmm.

01:19:44.363 --> 01:19:45.362
No, i... I...

01:19:47.195 --> 01:19:48.760
Yes.

01:19:48.762 --> 01:19:52.027
Yes, I will, I will.
Tomorrow.

01:19:52.029 --> 01:19:53.327
Mm-hmm.

01:19:53.329 --> 01:19:55.494
Yeah, all right.

01:19:55.496 --> 01:19:58.727
It's going to be mean
so much to...

01:19:58.729 --> 01:20:00.627
All right.

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:02.227
What?

01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:04.194
Yes, yes, I...

01:20:04.196 --> 01:20:06.627
All right.

01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:08.361
Good.

01:21:30.395 --> 01:21:32.160
Hello, Courtney.

01:21:33.295 --> 01:21:35.494
Hello.

01:21:35.496 --> 01:21:37.494
This is Galadriel.

01:21:39.128 --> 01:21:40.594
Hi.

01:21:40.596 --> 01:21:42.194
Hi, there.

01:21:52.128 --> 01:21:54.361
She's almost as tall as I am.

01:21:54.363 --> 01:21:56.127
She's a lovely girl.

01:21:56.129 --> 01:21:58.194
Well, of course she is.

01:21:58.196 --> 01:22:00.194
She's mine, isn't she?

01:22:02.428 --> 01:22:04.227
Well, let's get your luggage.

01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:06.227
I got it. This is it.

01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:09.060
I... I don't understand.

01:22:09.062 --> 01:22:10.994
Well, I'm only coming
for two days.

01:22:12.995 --> 01:22:14.127
Two days?

01:22:15.462 --> 01:22:17.427
But you said...

01:22:17.429 --> 01:22:20.361
I told you on the phone
that I would come for Christmas

01:22:20.363 --> 01:22:22.561
and see for myself
how the kid was doing.

01:22:22.562 --> 01:22:25.294
Yes, but when I sent you
the money, you said...

01:22:25.296 --> 01:22:26.494
I know what I said.

01:22:26.496 --> 01:22:28.461
Oh, wait.
It has been 13 years.

01:22:28.463 --> 01:22:30.160
You still think that you can
tell me what to do.

01:22:30.162 --> 01:22:32.760
I'm not.
I'm sorry.

01:22:32.762 --> 01:22:34.760
Please, let's not have
a scene here.

01:22:34.762 --> 01:22:36.227
Fine.

01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:38.127
Can we get out of here?

01:22:38.129 --> 01:22:39.994
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:22:50.362 --> 01:22:52.593
What? You started it.

01:22:54.627 --> 01:22:56.560
You're tired from the trip.

01:22:56.562 --> 01:22:58.693
I'm not drunk or high,
if that's what you're saying.

01:22:58.695 --> 01:23:01.693
It's not what I'm saying.

01:23:01.695 --> 01:23:05.626
Please just don't search
for reasons to fight me.

01:23:05.628 --> 01:23:07.727
Then don't shame me
in front of my own kid.

01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:09.994
You did enough of that with me
when I was here.

01:23:09.996 --> 01:23:12.094
I don't need any more of it.

01:23:13.362 --> 01:23:15.327
So, you just came for the money.

01:23:15.329 --> 01:23:18.194
Wow, you are such a...

01:23:18.196 --> 01:23:19.693
Fool?

01:23:19.695 --> 01:23:21.626
Yeah.

01:23:21.628 --> 01:23:23.727
Gilly and I, we thought we were

01:23:23.729 --> 01:23:26.361
coming to get her mother.

01:23:26.363 --> 01:23:27.760
My daughter.

01:23:27.762 --> 01:23:29.394
Were we wrong?

01:23:31.028 --> 01:23:33.526
I'm here, aren't I?

01:23:33.528 --> 01:23:35.526
Are you really here?

01:23:37.661 --> 01:23:39.194
Who are you?

01:23:42.028 --> 01:23:43.693
What am I going to say to her?

01:24:25.627 --> 01:24:27.194
Hello?

01:25:38.761 --> 01:25:40.426
I want to come back.

01:25:40.428 --> 01:25:42.227
Oh, honey.

01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:44.493
I want to come home.

01:25:44.495 --> 01:25:46.493
Oh, my poor baby.

01:25:46.495 --> 01:25:50.360
She only came
because Nonnie paid her to.

01:25:50.362 --> 01:25:52.094
She doesn't even want me,

01:25:52.096 --> 01:25:55.360
and she doesn't even want
to stay.

01:25:55.362 --> 01:25:58.194
It's all wrong.

01:25:58.196 --> 01:26:01.094
Nothing turned out
the way it was supposed to be.

01:26:01.096 --> 01:26:03.227
Supposed to be.

01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:05.360
Oh, life ain't supposed
to be nothing

01:26:05.362 --> 01:26:07.227
except maybe tough.

01:26:07.229 --> 01:26:10.160
But I thought
that when my mother came...

01:26:10.162 --> 01:26:13.626
Listen, all that stuff
about happy endings,

01:26:13.628 --> 01:26:15.526
it's just lies.

01:26:15.528 --> 01:26:19.127
Sometimes things will come easy.

01:26:19.129 --> 01:26:22.094
And you'll say, "finally,
I got a happy ending."

01:26:22.096 --> 01:26:24.360
That's the way things
is supposed to be.

01:26:24.362 --> 01:26:29.094
Like life, he owed you
good things.

01:26:29.096 --> 01:26:31.760
And there is a lot
of good things, baby.

01:26:31.762 --> 01:26:34.060
Like you,

01:26:34.062 --> 01:26:36.727
coming to spend time
with us this fall.

01:26:36.729 --> 01:26:39.760
Oh, that was mighty good
for me and William Ernest.

01:26:39.762 --> 01:26:41.626
But you're just fooling yourself

01:26:41.628 --> 01:26:44.460
if you expect good things
to come regular.

01:26:46.327 --> 01:26:51.227
Well, if life's so bad,
how come you are so happy?

01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:55.426
Did I say bad?
I said tough.

01:26:55.428 --> 01:26:57.194
There ain't nothing
can make you happy

01:26:57.196 --> 01:26:59.760
like doing good on a tough job.

01:26:59.762 --> 01:27:02.094
Trotter, stop preaching to me.

01:27:02.096 --> 01:27:04.626
I want to come home.

01:27:04.628 --> 01:27:07.760
You have been home, baby.

01:27:07.762 --> 01:27:09.560
Your grandma is your home.

01:27:09.562 --> 01:27:12.293
No, but I want to be
with you and William Ernest

01:27:12.295 --> 01:27:15.027
and Mr. Randolph.

01:27:15.029 --> 01:27:17.727
And leave her all alone?

01:27:17.729 --> 01:27:18.994
Could you do that?

01:27:20.662 --> 01:27:22.493
But I don't want to lose you.

01:27:22.495 --> 01:27:27.626
You're not losing a family.
You're getting another one.

01:27:27.628 --> 01:27:30.460
Me and William Ernest
and Mr. Randolph,

01:27:30.462 --> 01:27:32.560
we're not going anyplace.

01:27:32.562 --> 01:27:35.660
But your grandma is your blood.

01:27:35.662 --> 01:27:38.727
You need to take time
and get to know her.

01:27:42.728 --> 01:27:44.693
You're a part of me.

01:27:44.695 --> 01:27:47.426
And me a part of you now.

01:27:47.428 --> 01:27:51.360
Nobody can ever take that
away from us.

01:27:51.362 --> 01:27:52.526
Ever.

01:28:04.061 --> 01:28:05.994
She called from her car.

01:28:05.996 --> 01:28:08.293
She's lost, child.

01:28:08.295 --> 01:28:10.693
If you could have heard
her voice.

01:28:10.695 --> 01:28:12.426
She needs you.

01:28:12.428 --> 01:28:14.526
Trotter, stop trying to make

01:28:14.528 --> 01:28:16.460
a stinking Christian out of me.

01:28:18.129 --> 01:28:20.194
I wouldn't try to make nothing
out of you.

01:28:20.196 --> 01:28:22.493
Me and William Ernest
and Mr. Randolph,

01:28:22.495 --> 01:28:25.526
we kind of like you
the way you are.

01:28:35.061 --> 01:28:38.727
Now, I was thinking
about Thanksgiving.

01:28:38.729 --> 01:28:40.094
Remember?

01:28:40.096 --> 01:28:43.060
I owe you a Turkey dinner.

01:28:43.062 --> 01:28:45.027
And so,

01:28:45.029 --> 01:28:47.626
how about maybe...

01:28:47.628 --> 01:28:49.360
Maybe Easter.

01:28:49.362 --> 01:28:52.193
You come on back for a visit.

01:28:52.195 --> 01:28:53.727
I'll bake you
a big old juicy ham,

01:28:53.729 --> 01:28:57.326
and we'll bite the heads off
chocolate Easter bunnies.

01:28:57.328 --> 01:29:00.226
And we'll put rabbit ears
on Mr. Randolph.

01:29:01.495 --> 01:29:03.326
Oh, I think me
and William Ernest

01:29:03.328 --> 01:29:07.193
would just love that.

01:29:07.195 --> 01:29:08.660
Trotter...

01:29:11.461 --> 01:29:13.060
I love you.

01:29:15.028 --> 01:29:16.526
I know, baby.

01:29:16.528 --> 01:29:18.760
And I love you too.

01:29:57.527 --> 01:29:59.593
I'm ready to go home now.

01:30:11.094 --> 01:30:12.326
Thank you.

01:30:21.094 --> 01:30:25.193
Our girl's going to be
just fine, Maime.
