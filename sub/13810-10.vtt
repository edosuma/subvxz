01:31.382 --> 01:33.718
This big wind
is so awesome.

01:33.802 --> 01:37.263
Yeah, baby, bring
on the hurricane.

Yahoo!

01:39.057 --> 01:43.311
Can we please take
a break now?

01:46.898 --> 01:49.150
What's up, Sammy?

01:49.234 --> 01:52.529
The weather's getting
pretty sketchy, you guys.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.322
{\an1}Shouldn't we be
heading in?

01:54.405 --> 01:57.617
{\an5}Twister:
Squid, the TV weather guy said
that this is

01:57.700 --> 01:59.118
going to be, like,
the biggest storm

01:59.202 --> 02:02.789
to hit Ocean Shores
in 30 years. Hello?

02:02.872 --> 02:05.792
We've got to take advantage
of that.

02:05.875 --> 02:08.461
Think of the giant
50-foot waves.

02:08.544 --> 02:09.294
Oh.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.714
{\an1}And think
of the awesome wind.

02:11.798 --> 02:15.009
We could ride faster than
an alien battle cruiser.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.386

02:22.767 --> 02:24.227
Will you can it, you guys?

02:24.310 --> 02:25.979
Okay, Sammy.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.483
Boo!

02:30.567 --> 02:32.235
(<i> screams</i> )

02:39.826 --> 02:41.536
It's getting late.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.913
I'm not so sure

02:43.997 --> 02:45.081
about this, guys.

02:45.164 --> 02:47.792
Look at that sky.
Look at those waves.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.378
Didn't Raymundo tell us
to be home soon?

02:50.461 --> 02:53.715
{\an1}This just gets better
and better.

02:53.798 --> 02:54.340
Whoa!

02:56.342 --> 02:59.596
See? The wind's blowing
straight up the beach.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.598
And the boardwalk is
completely deserted.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.851
{\an4}Paula:
Maybe there's a good reason
it's deserted.

03:04.934 --> 03:07.228
{\an1}Maybe we should bag
this and try it later.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.981
When? the next hurricane?

03:10.064 --> 03:12.025
Come on already.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.029
See ya.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.363
Whoo!

03:17.447 --> 03:18.406
I just got to shoot this.

03:18.489 --> 03:21.451
Good or bad,
it's going to be rad.

03:21.534 --> 03:22.785
{\an1}Later.

03:22.869 --> 03:23.786
{\an1}One ride.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.372
Aw, what could it hurt?

03:26.456 --> 03:27.040
What could it hurt?

03:27.123 --> 03:29.959
My arms, my chin...

03:30.043 --> 03:31.794

my underwater housing.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.568
Rocket boy

03:55.652 --> 03:57.654
we're running out
of boardwalk.

03:57.737 --> 04:00.323
How do I stop this crazy thing?!

04:00.406 --> 04:01.407
You're asking us?

04:06.204 --> 04:08.164
(<i> screaming</i> )

04:11.250 --> 04:12.752
Everybody okay?

04:12.835 --> 04:14.879
{\an1}I'm okay.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.505
Nothing broken...

04:16.589 --> 04:18.757
yet!

04:19.841 --> 04:23.137
That was... that was...

04:23.221 --> 04:25.556

I got sand in my shorts.

(<i> yelling</i> )

04:42.115 --> 04:44.909
Let's head back... now.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.453
We can't ride.
We'll have to walk.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.871
Come on.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.040
On higher ground.

04:57.296 --> 04:57.422
Whoa!

05:01.634 --> 05:04.887
We broke our promise
to Dad for this?

I know, I know.

05:08.433 --> 05:12.020
(<i> all muttering</i> )

05:12.103 --> 05:16.399

05:35.251 --> 05:37.754
Maurice, why do you
do this to us?

05:37.837 --> 05:39.839
(<i> all talking</i> )

05:39.922 --> 05:42.592
All:
We don't know.

05:42.675 --> 05:43.885
(<i> all sneezing</i> )

05:43.968 --> 05:46.387
I hope so.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.847
Now go get some rest.

05:47.930 --> 05:50.058
It's going to be a long night.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.309

05:51.392 --> 05:53.352
(<i> wind howling and</i>
<i>thunder crashing</i> )

06:00.777 --> 06:02.779
It was like completely insane.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.113
We tore down the Strand

06:04.197 --> 06:05.073
at like so fast.

06:05.156 --> 06:07.784
It was just like
tow windsurfing

06:07.867 --> 06:09.410
without the water.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.662
I seem to remember water.

06:11.746 --> 06:12.914
Lots of water.

06:12.997 --> 06:13.915
Come on, I don't believe it.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.000
Sam, is this true?

06:16.084 --> 06:18.127
It's all true.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.506
Our very lives were in jeopardy.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.216
It was kind of cool.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.051
{\an5}I don't believe you.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.051
Oh, come on.

06:25.134 --> 06:27.804
I can prove it.
I shot the whole thing on video.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.138
Really? Cool.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.306
Let's check it out.

06:30.389 --> 06:33.935
Yeah, I want
to see it, Twist.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.187
Please! I don't want
to relive it.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.355
Chill, you guys.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.774
It's right here in my Twist cam.

06:39.857 --> 06:40.858
Oh, no!

06:40.942 --> 06:43.277
That huge wave!

06:43.361 --> 06:45.446
Uh-huh. Sure you did.

06:46.614 --> 06:47.740
(<i> all groaning</i> )

06:47.824 --> 06:49.325
My camera!

06:49.408 --> 06:53.579
Oh, man, I saved up forever
for that underwater housing.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.957
Don't worry. The housing
will keep it dry.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.085
Who cares if it's dry
if it gets washed away forever?

06:59.168 --> 07:01.629
I have to go get it.

07:01.712 --> 07:02.672
Forget it, Twister.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.215
We're not allowed
out of here

07:04.298 --> 07:06.008
until the hurricane
is past.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.219
{\an1}Yeah, buddy, as soon
as it clears up

07:08.302 --> 07:10.513
me and you will
go get it, okay?

07:10.596 --> 07:11.931
{\an3}Oh, man.

07:13.099 --> 07:13.683
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )

07:13.766 --> 07:15.184
(<i> yells</i> )

07:19.772 --> 07:21.691

07:36.539 --> 07:37.957
Otto, get up, man.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.542
The storm's over.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.712
Leave me alone, Twist.
I'm sleeping, man.

07:42.795 --> 07:47.633
Hey, you promised me as soon
as the hurricane was past

07:47.717 --> 07:49.552
you'd help me find
the Twist cam.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.346
{\an1}Okay, okay.
Keep it down.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.098
What are you guys doing?

07:54.182 --> 07:56.225
The storm's over.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.977
We're going to get
the Twister cam.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.854
We can't leave the gym
until they say it's safe.

07:59.937 --> 08:03.691
{\an1}Otto, no!

08:03.774 --> 08:04.775
Sam, wake up.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.069
{\an1}Otto and Twister went out
into the storm.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.531
Don't worry, I'll
save you guys.

08:10.615 --> 08:11.574
Sammy, wake up!

08:14.118 --> 08:16.746
(<i> whispering</i> )

08:16.829 --> 08:19.874
What?!

08:36.933 --> 08:39.018
{\an1}There's so much junk
everywhere.

08:39.101 --> 08:41.604
How are we going
to find the Twist cam?

08:41.687 --> 08:43.813
Let's just retrace
our steps.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.067
{\an1}Okay, I was right
about here.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.069
And I was right
behind you.

08:48.152 --> 08:50.613
{\an1}And then a big wave came
and knocked...

08:54.575 --> 08:56.035
Aren't you taking

08:56.118 --> 08:58.412
this reenactment thing
a little too far?

08:58.496 --> 08:59.705
What?

08:59.789 --> 09:02.458
(<i> shouting</i> ):
I said, aren't you taking

09:02.541 --> 09:04.418
this reenactment thing
a little too far?!

09:04.502 --> 09:09.966
{\an1}Dude, the hurricane
is back!

09:19.475 --> 09:22.603
They must be down
by the breakwater.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.106
{\an1}That's where Twist thought
he left his camera.

09:25.189 --> 09:28.276
Haven't you ever heard
of the eye of the storm?

09:28.359 --> 09:30.736
What are they teaching
you in school?

09:35.574 --> 09:37.201
Headquarters,
this is Rock.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.494
The Strand is in sight.

09:38.577 --> 09:41.831
I am proceeding in the
amphibious urban assault vehicle

09:41.914 --> 09:44.375
to Sector Alpha
for victim extraction. Over.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.669
Wow! What does this button do?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.170
(<i> siren blaring</i> )

09:48.254 --> 09:51.007
Don't touch that, grunt!

09:51.090 --> 09:53.801
This is my amphibious
urban assault vehicle.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.020
(<i> both gasp</i> )

10:05.438 --> 10:07.106
The Twist cam.

10:07.189 --> 10:09.525
Twister, no!

10:09.608 --> 10:12.028
I got it!

10:12.486 --> 10:14.363
Whoa! Whoa!

10:16.324 --> 10:17.575
Twister!

10:17.658 --> 10:19.452
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

10:19.535 --> 10:20.828
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

10:20.911 --> 10:22.455
Help!

10:28.252 --> 10:28.836
Help!

10:30.546 --> 10:33.341
(<i> siren blaring</i> )

10:37.762 --> 10:38.888
The Pier!

10:38.971 --> 10:41.682
The pier is
coming towards us!

10:41.766 --> 10:43.851
Otto!

10:43.934 --> 10:44.935
{\an3}Twister!

10:45.019 --> 10:45.770
(<i> yelling</i> )

10:52.360 --> 10:54.236
Come on, Otto.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.906
Come here, buddy.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.082
Come on, Twister.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.542
(<i> sighs</i> )

11:13.631 --> 11:14.465
Oh, Maurice!

11:14.548 --> 11:17.927
(<i> kissing sounds</i> )

11:18.010 --> 11:18.427
{\an1}Otto!

11:18.511 --> 11:21.222
Yeah, Dad?

11:21.305 --> 11:23.057
You are grounded

11:23.140 --> 11:24.183
forever.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.186
That's cool.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.271
What about me?

11:29.355 --> 11:32.108
We'll figure out
something, Maurice.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.692
Don't you worry.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.948
(<i> beeping</i> )

11:39.031 --> 11:41.200
What does this button do?

11:41.283 --> 11:42.827
(<i> ice cream truck</i>
<i>music playing</i> )

11:42.910 --> 11:45.329
Rock: You're pushing
my buttons, Dullard.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.872
(<i> all laughing</i> )

12:07.726 --> 12:10.104
{\an7}Whoop!

12:10.187 --> 12:12.815
{\an8}Ooh! Ahh!

12:12.898 --> 12:14.233
{\an5}Ahh!

12:12.898 --> 12:14.233
Ahh!

12:14.316 --> 12:15.651
Ahh!

12:15.734 --> 12:15.860
Ahh!

12:18.654 --> 12:20.573
{\an1}And that's
game point, baby.

12:20.656 --> 12:23.159
Wiggity, wiggity,
wiggity, wiggity.

12:23.242 --> 12:26.078
Why'd you dive out
of the way, Twist?

12:26.162 --> 12:29.081
It was either lose the point,
or lose my head.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.666
Then you can play with
the squid this time.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.587
You and me, Reg.
Rockets rule!

12:34.670 --> 12:36.088
{\an1}Sorry, guys.,
I'm out.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.007
{\an1}I'm meeting
Trish and Sherry.

12:38.090 --> 12:41.260
Hey, there, that was
one heck of a game you played.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.304
Thanks, dude

12:43.387 --> 12:44.597
I was talking to her.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.892
I'm Big Tony Santos, coach
of the California Girls

12:47.975 --> 12:50.186
12-and-Under All-State
Beach Volleyball Team.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.353
I'm sure you've
heard of us.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.689
Of course. It's only

12:53.772 --> 12:56.525
the best girls' volleyball team
on the West Coast.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.819
My friends Trish and Sherry
play on it.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.655
{\an5}Well, I can tell
by your game
that you've got

13:01.739 --> 13:04.700
{\an5}what we call in
the volleyball
world, "the stuff."

13:04.783 --> 13:05.951
Want to join?

13:06.035 --> 13:08.537
You mean play
on Trish and Sherry's team?

13:08.621 --> 13:11.332
By the way,
what's your name?

13:11.415 --> 13:12.374
Reggie Rocket.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.961
What do you say,
Reggie? Um, Rocket?

13:16.045 --> 13:18.297
Count me in. Thanks.

13:18.380 --> 13:19.089
Here's a schedule

13:19.173 --> 13:21.050
and a parental
consent form.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.802
{\an3}Are you ready to make a
commitment to excellence?

13:23.886 --> 13:26.597
Reggie:
You bet.

13:26.680 --> 13:30.309
I am so proud of
you, Rocket girl.

13:30.392 --> 13:33.229
That's Reggie the Rocket
to you.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.522
Sir.

13:34.605 --> 13:38.108
Mucho impressivo,
little Wahini cuz.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.318
And the best part is

13:39.401 --> 13:41.403
I get to play
with Trish and Sherry.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.322
The three of us
are going to rule.

13:43.405 --> 13:46.200
I remember when I made
the all-state team.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.618
You played beach volleyball?

13:47.701 --> 13:50.079
Volleyball? Eww.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.163
Hopscotch.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.208
Back in those days
I was known as Tito

13:54.291 --> 13:59.046
<i>king of the one-legged</i>
<i>triple skip hop waukani Junior.</i>

13:59.129 --> 14:02.758
<i>Once I was competing</i>
<i>for the grand champion</i>

14:02.841 --> 14:04.802
<i>of all the Hawaiian Islands</i>

14:04.885 --> 14:08.305
<i>when the great volcano</i>
<i>belched its fiery breath.</i>

14:14.144 --> 14:17.356
I stepped
on a piece of lava so hot

14:17.439 --> 14:21.360
I lost the championship
to my cousin Puki.

14:21.443 --> 14:24.363
You stepped on lava
playing hopscotch?

14:24.446 --> 14:25.698
It could've happened.

14:28.033 --> 14:31.245
I got to go wash
some dishes. Aloha.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.205
{\an1}Uh-oh.

14:33.289 --> 14:33.956
What's wrong, Dad?

14:34.039 --> 14:36.333
{\an1}Did you see
this schedule?

14:36.417 --> 14:38.210
You've got practice
every day.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.044
So?

14:39.128 --> 14:41.255
{\an1}Well, what about
street hockey?

14:41.338 --> 14:42.256
Hey, that's right.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.966
We got our big game next week.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.384
{\an3}Yeah.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.720
Wow, both volleyball
and hockey?

14:47.803 --> 14:49.763
That's going
to be tough.

14:49.847 --> 14:50.764
{\an3}Yeah.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.434
You can't miss hockey, Reg.

14:53.517 --> 14:54.226
You were on our team first.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.645
Yeah.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.314
Chill, Otto. I'm not
missing anything.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.649
Yeah.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.150
All:
Twister?

15:01.233 --> 15:03.277
Yeah?

15:03.360 --> 15:03.902
Okay.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.324
We need you, Reg.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.159
Don't worry.
Playing on both teams

15:10.242 --> 15:12.661
is going to be tough,
but I can handle it.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.120
We'll see.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.997
Yeah.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.502
Hey, guys.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.004
Hey, Reg.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.005
Hey, what's up, girl?

15:23.088 --> 15:26.467
Welcome to the big-time,
girlfriend.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.427
How cool is
this, you guys?

15:28.510 --> 15:31.680
All of us on the best
beach volleyball team

15:31.764 --> 15:33.474
in the state,
together.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.185
With you on the team,
we'll be unbeatable.

15:36.268 --> 15:36.894
(<i> whistle blowing</i> )

15:36.977 --> 15:38.646
Okay, team, listen up.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.856
Before we start,
let me introduce

15:40.939 --> 15:43.525
the newest member
of our team, Reggie Rocket.

15:43.609 --> 15:44.860
{\an1}Team:
Cool!

15:44.943 --> 15:46.904
We have one rule
on this team--

15:46.987 --> 15:48.489
that's to try your hardest.

15:48.572 --> 15:51.700
Miss a practice, you're not
trying hard enough. You're out.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.159
So let's get to work.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.169
Whee!

16:05.964 --> 16:09.426
Okay, girls,
that's it for today.

16:09.510 --> 16:12.554
We'll meet back here tomorrow
at 8:00 a.m. sharp.

16:12.638 --> 16:13.555
Nice shot, Reg.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.350
We're going to dominate.

16:16.433 --> 16:19.561
{\an5}Let's go chill with
some guava shakes
at the Shack.

16:19.645 --> 16:23.899
{\an4}I can't. I got to go
meet up with my brother
and the guys.

16:23.982 --> 16:25.984
{\an5}We've got
hockey practice.

16:26.068 --> 16:26.985
Hockey?

16:27.069 --> 16:29.071
{\an1}Whatever.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.077
Hey, Reg, thanks for coming.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.080
(<i> panting</i> )

16:38.163 --> 16:38.789
Sorry I'm late.

16:38.872 --> 16:41.792
Hey, Reg, did you shrink?

16:41.875 --> 16:44.461
{\an1}Think you're
missing something.

16:44.545 --> 16:45.796
Aw, man.

16:45.879 --> 16:48.382
I'm so sorry,
you guys.

16:48.465 --> 16:49.717
I'll be right back.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.135
Oh!

16:51.218 --> 16:52.761
What's the matter?

16:52.845 --> 16:54.012
I thought I grew.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.643
Aw, man, this is out of control.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.019
(<i> grunting</i> )

17:05.022 --> 17:07.192
(<i> groaning</i> )

17:19.538 --> 17:21.707
Oops.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.169
So what do you think, Otto?

17:25.252 --> 17:26.295
I don't know, Sammy.

17:26.377 --> 17:27.963
We're looking
a little rusty.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.715
I think we might have to
add some extra practices

17:29.798 --> 17:31.925
before our
first game.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.178
{\an1}More practices? Are you
kidding, Rocket Boy?

17:34.261 --> 17:35.888
I'm already pulling
double duty as it is.

17:35.971 --> 17:38.974
{\an1}Come on, Reg.
You want to win?

17:39.057 --> 17:40.142
Yeah. Lars

17:40.225 --> 17:42.603
{\an5}and his team
look really
good this year.

17:46.231 --> 17:49.193
No, I know.
I'm sorry, you guys.

17:49.276 --> 17:52.613
I guess I'm just tired
after the first day.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.409
Wow, she's
really wiped out.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.619
She's a Rocket.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.162
She'll be fine.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.374
Come on, let's go!
Pick up the pace!

18:04.458 --> 18:05.834
Some practice, huh?

18:05.918 --> 18:06.835
I'm wiped.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.838
At least
we're done for today.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.215
Line up for Jumping-jacks.

18:11.298 --> 18:14.009
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!

18:14.092 --> 18:15.761
One, two, three, four!

18:15.844 --> 18:18.639
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!

18:18.722 --> 18:20.140
One, two, three, four!

18:20.224 --> 18:23.143
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>
<i>One, two...</i>

18:31.360 --> 18:32.569
(<i> yawning</i> )

18:32.653 --> 18:38.200
Okay, you guys, get
into spike formation.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.201
I'll serve.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.994
What is she
talking about?

18:41.078 --> 18:42.663
I don't know, dude.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.628
Are you all right, Sammy?

18:49.711 --> 18:51.797
I think so.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.007
Is it safe to put
my hands down yet?

18:54.091 --> 18:57.344
{\an1}You almost womped
the Squid big time.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.054
We've got a game
in two days

18:59.137 --> 18:59.763
and you're playing
like crud.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.182
What do you mean?

19:02.266 --> 19:05.227
{\an5}I think all that
volleyball is messing
with your game.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.230
{\an1}Oh, yeah? I don't hear Twist
or Sam complaining.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.147
Right, guys?

19:09.231 --> 19:11.733
Your game is kind of off, Reg.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.610
{\an1}You're really
stinking up the place.

19:13.694 --> 19:14.486
{\an3}See?

19:14.570 --> 19:16.280
Gee, thanks
for the support.

19:18.448 --> 19:21.410
What's the matter,
little Reggie-ca?

19:21.493 --> 19:24.329
{\an5}You look sadder than
a big-wave surfer
on a golf course.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.914
Got a problem?

19:25.998 --> 19:28.417
{\an1}My problem is that I've got
volleyball <i> and</i> hockey

19:28.500 --> 19:29.668
and I'm always wiped

19:29.751 --> 19:31.253
and the guys are giving me
a hard time, and...

19:31.336 --> 19:32.671
Whoa, slow down.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.506
You're going to hurt your
tongue talking that fast.

19:34.590 --> 19:35.883
I'm doing everything
too fast.

19:35.966 --> 19:38.927
{\an1}I don't know if I can hack
doing hockey <i> and</i> volleyball.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.680
Then do what you can.

19:41.763 --> 19:44.600
Remember what
the ancient Hawaiian said.

19:44.683 --> 19:48.353
"The pelican can fly
as high as the stars

19:48.437 --> 19:50.147
if she believes she can."

19:50.230 --> 19:54.818
Pelicans don't have
two practices a day.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.947
Hey, Trish, what's up?

19:59.031 --> 20:00.824
What?!
But I've got...

20:00.908 --> 20:04.119
{\an1}I know what
the coach said.

20:04.202 --> 20:05.787
Okay. See ya.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.623
Bad news, Rocket Girl?

20:07.706 --> 20:09.124
The coach added
another practice

20:09.207 --> 20:11.209
to make sure we're ready
for the tournament.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.169
So?

20:12.252 --> 20:13.128
It's on Saturday

20:13.211 --> 20:14.880
same time as
the hockey game.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.633
What?!

20:14.963 --> 20:17.633
Sorry, kiddo.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.343
I guess you got
to make a choice.

20:19.426 --> 20:21.136
Aw, man, this
stinks on ice.

20:21.219 --> 20:22.888
{\an1}You're going
to blow us off

20:22.971 --> 20:23.847
for that volleyball team.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.391
Hey, I didn't
say that.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.727
{\an1}Then what are you
going to do?

20:28.810 --> 20:30.270
Uh, I don't know.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.855
I just don't know.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.815
(<i> groaning</i> )

20:36.026 --> 20:37.486
Why don't you
take it easy

20:37.569 --> 20:39.154
on your sister,
Rocket Boy?

20:39.237 --> 20:41.073
This is not
what she needs right now.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.991
But, Dad, she was
on our team first.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.619
Remember? Rockets rule?

20:45.702 --> 20:48.455
So she played volleyball
second.

20:48.538 --> 20:49.623
Maybe she likes it, too.

20:49.706 --> 20:52.334
Why?

20:56.880 --> 20:59.341
(<i> whistle blowing</i> )

20:59.424 --> 21:01.510
{\an1}Why are we
doing this again?

21:01.593 --> 21:03.428
{\an8}I got to see
something. Shh!

21:09.059 --> 21:11.353
(<i> whistle blows</i> )

21:11.436 --> 21:13.188
Wow. Reggie's
really good.

21:13.271 --> 21:16.483
She's just about
the best one on the team.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.360
And this is the
all-state team.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.904
That means she's
the best of the best.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.948
Yeah.
Come on, you guys.

21:23.031 --> 21:24.950
We got to do something.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.744
Hey!

21:33.125 --> 21:35.836
(<i> whistle blowing</i> )

21:35.919 --> 21:36.962
{\an1}Nice shot.

21:37.045 --> 21:38.505
Nicer save.

21:38.588 --> 21:41.717
You're all over
the place today, Reg.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.886
{\an1}With you on the team, we'll
win tomorrow's game for sure.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.972
Oh, man.
Our hockey game is tomorrow.

21:47.055 --> 21:49.099
You know what that means?

21:49.182 --> 21:49.975
What?

21:50.058 --> 21:52.436
But I can't let the guys down.

21:52.519 --> 21:53.687
I'm really sorry, you guys.

21:53.770 --> 21:56.523
Yeah, so are we.

all over for you.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.208
Otto, what's the deal?

22:15.292 --> 22:16.585
I got the big game rescheduled.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.587
But why?

22:18.670 --> 22:21.048
'Cause it's important
to you, right?

22:21.131 --> 22:22.299
You can do both.

22:22.382 --> 22:23.383
I know you can.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.427
Little brother,
you're the best.

22:25.510 --> 22:28.805
{\an4}Remind me of this
the next time you
do something stupid.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.557
No problemo.
Now come on.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.852
We got to get
to volleyball practice <i> now.</i>

22:33.935 --> 22:36.354
All right,
you're the best.

22:36.438 --> 22:37.939
