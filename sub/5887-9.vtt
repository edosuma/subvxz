Hi, Mom.

- You want me to do that?
- In gloves?

00:52.035 --> 00:54.202
The blender was broken
at the diner.

00:54.238 --> 00:56.655
And you wouldn't dare
deprive them of dessert.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.208
You look swanky.
Fundraising?

Much better.

Master's degree.

your experience,

but people love to talk to me.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.852
They seek me out
to share their confidences.

You know what time
I go to work.

and the flight--

02:40.894 --> 02:43.445
Why am I explaining
myself to you?

02:43.480 --> 02:45.230
I'm tired of asking
for an allowance.

02:45.282 --> 02:47.199
Can we just sign the papers
and be done with this?

02:47.234 --> 02:48.734
Your lawyer is very aggressive.

02:48.786 --> 02:51.203
That's not how I heard it.

02:51.238 --> 02:53.121
I'm starting to think
you're enjoying this.

02:53.157 --> 02:56.241
Well, my finances are a mess

02:56.243 --> 02:59.077
You were a millionaire
when I met you.

02:59.129 --> 03:02.331
Just tell your lawyer he won.
I'll sign whatever you want.

- It's too much.

- I can't do it by myself.
- Well, you should have asked me.

Sit down, Shirley.

you have a meeting

Secor Laxatives.

I'm sorry, but actually,
he's at Life Cereal.

Isn't he NAC?

I'll check the Rolodex.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.970
I'm sorry, what's NAC?

03:59.022 --> 04:00.472
No afternoon calls.

Lester's blotto after lunch.

04:02.393 --> 04:04.976
- He is indeed.
- Well, let's call him now.

Isn't that tiring?

04:25.549 --> 04:27.416
What's tiring
is coming back here.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.217
So beautiful.
You should go sometime.

- The Manson family.
- Are they coming in?

04:39.813 --> 04:42.314
No. A quick word?

04:42.349 --> 04:43.849
Coffee.

04:46.820 --> 04:50.021
So, I got a strange phone call.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.524
Well, not strange,
but unexpected.

04:52.526 --> 04:55.026
- Megan called me.
- Really?

04:55.078 --> 04:57.329
I guess she's coming into town
and she wants to buy me a drink

find a new agent.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.365

05:00.417 --> 05:01.867
Of course I can.
I do it all the time.

It's just, well,

Yes, but she didn't want me to.

05:12.296 --> 05:14.179
So should I meet with her?

pretty deep to find a woman.

Are you okay?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.807
No.

13:02.148 --> 13:03.765
What's wrong?

13:04.935 --> 13:06.651
I lied to you.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.519
Already?

13:10.440 --> 13:14.659
No, I left home because
I have a little girl.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.945
I had a little girl.

13:18.748 --> 13:20.498
Oh.

13:22.702 --> 13:26.004
I'm so--
I'm so sorry.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.705
Yes.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.542
When?

13:33.463 --> 13:35.713
Two years ago.

13:35.715 --> 13:38.266
The flu.
Can you imagine?

13:40.103 --> 13:41.552
I'm so sorry.

13:45.108 --> 13:47.141
I don't want to talk about it.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.561
Obviously,
I'm in New York City.

13:53.783 --> 13:55.867
You should go.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.287
It's my house.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.041
Don't you have to
get ready for work?

14:10.834 --> 14:12.333
I don't feel like it.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.254
( chuckles )

14:28.068 --> 14:30.401
Gentlemen, I'm going
to be strict,

14:30.437 --> 14:32.487
but this is Torkelson's law.

14:32.522 --> 14:34.439
Take a good look.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.275
You got your models,
you got your bottles.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.777
If you make it to lunch
without bothering anybody,

14:39.829 --> 14:41.913
we'll let you have
whichever you want.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.031
( laughing )

14:43.083 --> 14:45.917
Ah, well, if you'll
all excuse me.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.788
Come on, I'll introduce you.

14:50.790 --> 14:54.175
Pima Ryan, this is our
art director Stan Rizzo.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.462
So you'll be cutting up
my work, will you?

14:58.631 --> 15:00.715
Well, I try
to treat it like art

15:00.767 --> 15:02.967
even though it's just
selling something.

15:02.969 --> 15:05.186
All art is selling something.

15:05.221 --> 15:08.106
No, we're actually
selling something.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.807
Today it's vermouth.

15:09.809 --> 15:12.060
I apologize the models
have so many teeth.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.945
I know you're not used to that.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.980
Pleasure to meet you.

15:19.486 --> 15:20.952
I'm sorry about that.

15:20.987 --> 15:24.455
He has a hard time
with... new people.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.958
- No, he hates himself.
- ( laughs )

15:26.993 --> 15:29.627
I don't think so.
He's got a huge ego.

15:29.662 --> 15:32.163
And he's a photographer.

15:32.215 --> 15:35.166
Ah, men like him
don't bother me.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.001
And they shouldn't
bother you either.

15:37.053 --> 15:38.719
Look at all you're doing here.

15:38.755 --> 15:40.755
Just my job.

15:42.725 --> 15:44.258
Good morning, girls.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.344
Could you take your places?

15:58.108 --> 16:00.658
- Good morning.
- It's 11:30.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.493
Where were you?
I was worried.

16:02.529 --> 16:05.246
- I was sleepy.
- Mr. Sterling's in there.

16:05.281 --> 16:07.031
He's not to be disturbed.

16:10.787 --> 16:12.286
Who are you hiding from?

16:12.338 --> 16:15.089
Got two secretaries
and three telephones.

16:15.125 --> 16:17.875
I feel like Marlin Perkins
is chasing me on the savannah.

16:17.927 --> 16:20.428
- Hiding is pointless.
- I've got work to do.

16:20.463 --> 16:22.213
That's the other
reason I'm here.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.348
McCann represents Derby Foods.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.766
Peter Pan Peanut Butter.

16:25.802 --> 16:27.935
- They're making a cookie.
- Sounds delicious.

16:27.971 --> 16:29.804
McCann also represents Nabisco.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.556
National Biscuit Company.

16:31.608 --> 16:33.391
They got the word cookie
in their name.

16:33.443 --> 16:36.027
No, they don't.
Do we have a shot at Derby?

16:36.062 --> 16:37.528
No, it's just a cookie.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.564
McCann's clients are our clients.
We're helping out.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.566
You and Peter are taking them
golfing tomorrow.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.484
- I can't make it.
- <i> ( intercom buzzes )</i>

16:43.536 --> 16:46.120
Meredith: <i>There's a messenger
here from your attorney's office.</i>

16:46.156 --> 16:48.456
<i>He needs your signature.</i>

16:48.491 --> 16:50.208
So why can't you go golfing?

16:50.243 --> 16:52.827
Since Burt Peterson's
the account man.

16:58.468 --> 16:59.884
Good news or bad news?

16:59.919 --> 17:02.720
Good news.
It's almost over.

17:02.755 --> 17:06.174
Well, don't settle until
you get the number you want.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.675
Take it from me,
no matter what she says,

17:07.727 --> 17:09.227
you have given her
the good life.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.928
She would never have had it.

17:10.980 --> 17:12.430
Megan is not Jane.

17:12.482 --> 17:15.849
So she never said you squandered
her youth and beauty?

17:15.902 --> 17:17.435
Used up her childbearing years?

17:17.436 --> 17:19.153
Thwarted her career?
What career?

17:19.189 --> 17:20.820
- She's a consumer.
- <i> ( intercom buzzes )</i>

17:20.857 --> 17:22.940
Meredith: <i>Mr. Sterling,
are you still at lunch?</i>

17:22.942 --> 17:24.442
<i>They're wondering.</i>

17:24.444 --> 17:25.776
She made her choices.

You're very good.

17:39.865 --> 17:41.832
( sighs )

17:41.867 --> 17:43.533
Can I help you?

17:43.585 --> 17:47.003
Well, I've been told that my
negatives belong to the agency

17:47.039 --> 17:49.706
and therefore processing
has to be done at your lab.

17:49.758 --> 17:51.675
I'm not comfortable with that.

17:51.710 --> 17:54.211
I hate to break it to you,

17:54.213 --> 17:56.012
but it's not really
yours anymore.

17:57.299 --> 17:58.932
Don't you have a darkroom here?

17:58.967 --> 18:01.434
Yes, but I can't do that.

18:03.388 --> 18:05.305
I started off as a clerk

18:05.357 --> 18:08.108
with a newspaper in Sarasota.

18:08.143 --> 18:10.527
All I wanted was to get
in that darkroom.

18:10.562 --> 18:14.614
It's a nice thing to have,
especially in the city.

18:14.650 --> 18:18.068
So, you're a photographer.

18:19.238 --> 18:21.371
I do everything.

18:21.406 --> 18:23.039
I'm an art director.

18:23.075 --> 18:26.042
You must show me your work.

18:26.078 --> 18:28.211
I don't know.

18:29.915 --> 18:33.383
I can feel the tension
of your need for my opinion.

18:33.418 --> 18:36.586
( scoffs )

18:36.638 --> 18:39.422
I wouldn't mind
you taking a look

18:39.424 --> 18:41.841
if you promise to be honest.

18:41.894 --> 18:44.177
Let's see how brave you are.

You're not on call, are you?

Are you in a creative mood

I don't know what I'm doing.

21:05.518 --> 21:07.969
Everything good I have
is from a long time ago.

21:08.021 --> 21:09.938
So what?

21:09.973 --> 21:11.723
You think Picasso
looks at "Guernica"

21:11.775 --> 21:13.641
and says, "Ignore that.
It was a long time ago"?

21:16.479 --> 21:18.446
I got nothing to show her.

21:18.481 --> 21:20.448
Who cares about her?

21:21.651 --> 21:23.901
You should see what she does.

It's so sensual.

Get your camera.

Why?

21:32.212 --> 21:34.629
I want you to take my picture.

No touching the model.

How could I be
nervous at this point?

22:17.340 --> 22:18.790
I know.

22:18.842 --> 22:21.959
There's a twinge in my chest.

No, it's not that.

39:40.486 --> 39:42.236
Send me the papers.

39:47.743 --> 39:49.626
I want you to be honest.

39:49.662 --> 39:51.628
Should I let my hair grow out?

39:51.664 --> 39:53.130
Good night, everybody.

39:53.165 --> 39:55.999
Ed, you were right.
Pima's a treasure.

39:56.051 --> 39:57.835
Is she?

39:57.887 --> 40:00.254
You don't like the work?
Because I was thinking,

40:00.306 --> 40:02.756
you know, she'd be right
for Butler Shoes.

40:02.758 --> 40:04.808
Or maybe Topaz Pantyhose.

40:04.844 --> 40:06.560
She's got a thing for legs.

40:06.595 --> 40:08.395
Women's legs.

40:08.431 --> 40:10.230
Sorry to disappoint you.

40:10.266 --> 40:13.400
I'm not disappointed.

40:13.436 --> 40:16.019
Neither was she.

40:18.941 --> 40:20.574
Really?

40:20.609 --> 40:22.276
Does that bother you?

40:24.613 --> 40:26.163
No.

40:26.198 --> 40:27.998
But I bet it might
bother Ellen.

40:28.033 --> 40:29.283
Elaine.

40:29.285 --> 40:31.034
This is none of your business.

40:31.086 --> 40:33.620
No.

40:33.622 --> 40:35.622
It's Pima's business,

40:35.674 --> 40:38.926
which turns out to be
more advertising than art.

40:40.546 --> 40:41.795
She's a hustler.

40:41.797 --> 40:44.131
You're jealous.

40:44.183 --> 40:46.216
She tried
the same thing with me.

40:46.268 --> 40:48.469
But she didn't get as far.

40:48.471 --> 40:51.355
And that's why I'm not going
to give her another job.

40:53.058 --> 40:54.892
I don't believe you.

40:54.944 --> 40:57.561
Which part?

41:08.961 --> 41:10.594
<i>( door closes )</i>

41:12.231 --> 41:13.677

41:15.702 --> 41:17.456

41:19.348 --> 41:22.101

41:22.975 --> 41:24.475
Not particularly.

41:24.476 --> 41:28.295
_

41:28.296 --> 41:31.116
_

41:31.951 --> 41:34.785
So you ordered room service?

_

41:37.509 --> 41:40.267
_

41:40.876 --> 41:42.159
I don't care.

41:42.211 --> 41:44.411
She's leaving Papa.

41:46.832 --> 41:48.132
I'm going to pack.

_

41:51.514 --> 41:53.876

41:55.224 --> 41:57.007
I don't want to hear about it.

_

42:00.595 --> 42:03.989
_

42:04.316 --> 42:06.016
You know it's a sin
to be a ghoul

42:06.068 --> 42:07.684
and feed on everyone's pain?

42:09.155 --> 42:13.323
She's been very unhappy
for a very long time.

42:13.359 --> 42:15.359
At least she did
something about it.

42:22.084 --> 42:24.001
( sighs )

42:24.036 --> 42:26.036
I'm exhausted.

42:26.088 --> 42:29.339
Me, too.

42:29.375 --> 42:31.425
Did you print anything?

42:31.460 --> 42:33.210
They're drying.

42:33.212 --> 42:35.262
You did?

42:35.297 --> 42:37.714
How were they?
What did Pima say?

42:40.886 --> 42:42.719
She loved them.

42:42.721 --> 42:44.688
How about you?

42:52.064 --> 42:54.615
<i>( siren blaring )</i>

43:12.218 --> 43:15.135
Do you want a drink?
I just have vodka.

43:15.171 --> 43:17.421
Yes, please.

43:17.423 --> 43:20.557
Oh, I got you something.

43:20.593 --> 43:22.259
Open it.

43:27.149 --> 43:29.099
It's a New York City guidebook.

43:29.151 --> 43:31.101
Finally start your tour.

43:32.354 --> 43:33.654
Go on.

43:36.525 --> 43:39.109
Can't you see
I don't want anything?

43:42.698 --> 43:45.249
Look, I'm pretty sure
I had a worse day than you.

43:45.284 --> 43:46.750
Please don't be in a mood.

43:46.785 --> 43:49.036
I'm not in a mood.

43:49.088 --> 43:51.622
And you've never had
a worse day than me.

43:51.624 --> 43:54.208
You don't think
I've felt grief?

43:54.260 --> 43:56.793
You knew that about me
the first night we met.

43:59.849 --> 44:02.683
I've been trying
to talk myself out of it.

44:02.718 --> 44:04.468
Don't.

44:04.470 --> 44:05.969
No.

44:06.021 --> 44:08.355
Talk myself out
of what I have to say.

44:08.390 --> 44:10.858
You're scared.
I understand.

44:12.311 --> 44:15.028
But I took care
of everything today.

44:16.649 --> 44:18.949
I've been separated
a long time.

44:21.153 --> 44:24.905
You're not the first
thing to come along.

44:26.625 --> 44:28.325
I'm ready.

44:28.377 --> 44:30.160
( scoffs )

44:30.162 --> 44:32.963
You're fooling yourself
if you think this'll make a difference.

44:32.998 --> 44:34.831
You don't think I know
what's going on here?

44:34.833 --> 44:37.084
Look at this dump.

44:37.136 --> 44:39.303
I know you think
you deserve this.

44:39.338 --> 44:40.754
I've done it.

44:43.475 --> 44:45.475
I left my daughter.

44:45.511 --> 44:48.228
Stop blaming yourself.

44:48.264 --> 44:50.814
No.

44:50.849 --> 44:53.400
I had two children.

44:53.435 --> 44:55.018
Two girls.

44:56.939 --> 44:59.356
One died and one...

45:03.245 --> 45:06.747
my oldest is in Racine
with her father.

45:10.035 --> 45:12.536
Why? Don't you want
to ask why?

45:14.673 --> 45:16.173
No.

45:23.799 --> 45:26.383
I told you about my heart.

45:28.053 --> 45:30.554
I don't want to feel
anything else.

45:32.191 --> 45:35.025
When I was with you,
I forgot about...

45:39.031 --> 45:40.731
her.

45:42.117 --> 45:43.817
I don't ever want to do that.
