WEBVTT

00:17.800 --> 00:19.879
The Immortal is back.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.839
But he's dead, everybody knows it.

00:23.480 --> 00:25.519
What's gonna happen now?

00:28.640 --> 00:30.800
We gotta fight a ghost?

00:31.359 --> 00:33.079
Ghosts don't kill people.

00:35.640 --> 00:37.679
Ciro Di Marzio is alive.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.399
But he's alone,

00:51.799 --> 00:53.759
we're an army.

00:53.840 --> 00:56.560
But we gotta stop him
before he gets organized.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.920
I wanna double the men on the streets.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.679
I don't want any of you to walk alone.

01:04.159 --> 01:08.200
Spread the word there's a nice reward
for anyone giving me info about him.

01:09.599 --> 01:11.560
Naples has gotta be my eyes.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.760
But this won't be enough.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.200
And so?

01:18.359 --> 01:19.439
What do we gotta do?

01:20.920 --> 01:22.879
One of you has to betray me.

01:52.120 --> 01:55.200
Don Genna'... I could never betray you.

01:57.439 --> 01:58.959
I know.

01:59.879 --> 02:03.079
But what does Ciro say?
You used to belong to him.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.680
What if he doesn't believe me?

02:14.520 --> 02:16.960
I'm sure you'll be convincing.

02:34.680 --> 02:41.560
GOMORRA

03:15.879 --> 03:19.719
I wasn't even ten when I used
to come here to unload cigarettes.

03:20.639 --> 03:23.719
- Did you do contraband too?
- I was a kid.

03:24.719 --> 03:26.680
It all seemed like a game.

03:28.360 --> 03:30.400
That's why you chose to stay here.

03:32.879 --> 03:37.240
To play this final game I wanted
to come back to where it all started.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.719
The final game, Ciro?

03:47.280 --> 03:50.120
At this point you gotta figure
there's no continuation.

03:51.199 --> 03:53.360
But I don't give a shit,

03:53.439 --> 03:56.400
I just want this to end the way I want.

04:03.159 --> 04:05.039
Signora Avitabile, can you come out?

04:20.439 --> 04:21.360
Hi, Azzurra.

04:25.839 --> 04:28.000
You're not inviting me in?

04:30.519 --> 04:32.000
Come in.

05:00.439 --> 05:01.360
What do you want?

05:06.199 --> 05:09.079
I've done horrible things in my life.

05:13.959 --> 05:17.199
But this time I've done something
that can't be fixed.

05:19.079 --> 05:20.000
What?

05:26.600 --> 05:28.079
Ciro's alive.

05:33.199 --> 05:34.720
How's that possible?

05:35.959 --> 05:37.800
You killed him.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.439
Tell me what you've done.

05:44.519 --> 05:46.920
What I've always done.

05:49.120 --> 05:52.120
What I did with you
when I wanted to protect you,

05:52.199 --> 05:54.800
what I did with my father.

05:54.879 --> 05:57.319
I did the same with him.

05:57.399 --> 06:00.079
I hurt him badly

06:00.160 --> 06:02.839
because he left me on my own,

06:02.920 --> 06:05.120
he abandoned me.

06:05.759 --> 06:08.680
He wanted to make
a new life without me.

06:13.879 --> 06:17.240
Now that he's back he won't rest
until he sees me dead.

06:22.360 --> 06:25.000
That's your personal business.

06:28.279 --> 06:30.319
This concerns you and Pietro as well.

06:30.399 --> 06:33.360
That's why I'm here, to protect you.

06:46.079 --> 06:48.680
You're not capable of protecting anyone,

06:49.639 --> 06:52.600
that's why we need
to protect ourselves from you.

08:54.639 --> 08:57.039
On the ground! Don't move.

09:05.639 --> 09:08.120
How dare you come here
after what you did?

09:08.200 --> 09:10.919
I know that you belonged
to the Capaccios.

09:11.840 --> 09:14.600
My people ended badly 'cause of you,
piece of trash.

09:15.159 --> 09:17.080
This was before.

09:17.679 --> 09:21.639
- Now we got another chance.
- I heard he came back.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.840
I don't believe in fairy tales,
the dead don't come back.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.960
And now you'll find out

09:28.440 --> 09:30.120
'cause you're about to die.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.000
He's alive

09:34.279 --> 09:36.759
and I'd do anything for him.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.600
I'm not afraid to die for Ciro.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.679
The old clans are done, Tunisian.

09:58.919 --> 10:02.240
But now the time's come
to rise again like he did.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.480
If you don't believe me

10:12.440 --> 10:14.480
I can set up a meeting.

10:47.600 --> 10:51.600
Federico, the Immortal's alone,
he's got no guns and no men.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.240
What's all this fuss about?

10:54.759 --> 10:58.919
Gennaro knows that a spark
is enough to set off an inferno.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.360
And this fire travels fast.

11:39.679 --> 11:41.559
Look me in the eye and tell me it's true.

11:47.559 --> 11:48.480
Is he alive?

11:52.200 --> 11:54.320
Is he looking for soldiers?

11:55.200 --> 11:57.279
He's not looking for soldiers,

11:57.360 --> 11:59.279
he's looking for companions.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.639
To wreak havoc. Together.

12:03.720 --> 12:07.720
The Savastanos, the Capaccios,
the Levantes left Naples in ruins.

12:09.440 --> 12:12.039
But the time's come to change things.

12:17.919 --> 12:19.200
Dude...

12:20.039 --> 12:22.200
Gennaro's strong.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.320
What's Ciro got?

12:33.440 --> 12:35.080
He's got us.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.720
All of us together we're stronger.

12:40.519 --> 12:42.720
Wars are won with guns.

12:43.960 --> 12:47.679
And as far as I know,
those who stay alive win.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.679
Or those who never die.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.519
You think it'll be enough?

13:28.879 --> 13:30.399
That's what Gennaro says.

13:31.039 --> 13:33.039
Gennaro is just one man,

13:34.080 --> 13:35.120
the Immortal isn't.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.679
He's not?

13:41.840 --> 13:44.679
He's just a man like any other.

13:45.399 --> 13:47.320
Did you see their faces?

13:47.399 --> 13:50.159
Did you see the fear in their eyes?

13:52.039 --> 13:54.440
They really believe
Ciro Di Marzio is immortal.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.120
He isn't.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.240
Why, do you believe it?

14:09.480 --> 14:12.200
Jesus Christ died on the cross
and rose again.

14:12.279 --> 14:14.240
Wasn't he a man too?

14:17.840 --> 14:21.840
When lies make love with fear
they become the voice of the people.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.720
Voice of the people, voice of God.

15:08.679 --> 15:10.080
Hey, Pitbull.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.000
It's me.

15:15.879 --> 15:17.320
I'm by myself.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.000
What do you want from me?

15:22.360 --> 15:24.320
I wanna talk to Ciro.

15:26.320 --> 15:29.200
This fine idea is yours
or Gennaro Savastano's?

15:29.279 --> 15:32.080
If it was Gennaro's,
would I be here by myself?

15:33.840 --> 15:35.399
I can't help you.

15:36.279 --> 15:38.720
You and me used to be brothers.

15:38.799 --> 15:40.759
Yeah, but now you're on the other side.

15:45.919 --> 15:49.279
Gennaro's turning the world upside down
to find him

15:49.360 --> 15:53.919
and he wants to kill everyone
who's always been loyal to Ciro.

15:54.399 --> 15:56.279
Guys like me.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.480
You gotta take me to him.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.200
And once you've spoken to Ciro?

16:09.279 --> 16:11.360
You think he can save you?

17:01.440 --> 17:03.639
Talk to your friend,

17:04.200 --> 17:06.319
here's everything you asked for.

17:50.720 --> 17:53.400
I gotta say, you got guts coming here.

18:04.279 --> 18:06.279
I wanted to see with my own eyes.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.279
Don't you like being with Gennaro?

18:12.440 --> 18:14.720
No one likes being with Gennaro,

18:15.279 --> 18:17.119
he's worse than his father.

18:19.839 --> 18:21.480
Ciro...

18:21.559 --> 18:24.119
I've always belonged to you,

18:24.200 --> 18:26.079
I've always been loyal to you.

18:27.319 --> 18:29.400
And he knows it too.

18:31.119 --> 18:32.559
He does?

18:35.240 --> 18:37.480
If he knows it,
how come you're still alive?

18:39.880 --> 18:43.160
As soon as I found out
about the message I ran

18:43.240 --> 18:45.279
and I came to look for you.

18:46.079 --> 18:48.720
I haven't seen Gennaro since.

18:50.559 --> 18:52.240
I don't believe you.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.400
If you don't believe me, kill me now,

19:02.920 --> 19:05.960
because if I can't be with you,
I'm done for out there.

19:08.720 --> 19:12.680
Sincerely, I'd prefer you kill me,
as you've always been my friend,

19:13.519 --> 19:17.400
rather than Genny Savastano,
who's nothing to me.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.559
If you want to save yourself,

19:22.640 --> 19:24.599
you gotta give me proof.

20:08.680 --> 20:11.599
- Well?
- She takes the kid to school.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.079
And she's always alone at home.

20:14.160 --> 20:18.519
She lives in an isolated villa,
there's a garden around it.

20:18.599 --> 20:21.000
- How many guards has she got?
- Two.

20:21.079 --> 20:23.480
They work in shifts.

20:23.559 --> 20:25.359
Just two?

20:27.839 --> 20:29.240
Good.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.680
Tomorrow we'll kill the mother
and the kid.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.200
What's wrong?

20:40.440 --> 20:42.160
The kid's five years old.

20:46.880 --> 20:50.440
Hatred's like the hunger of a man
who hasn't eaten in days.

20:52.079 --> 20:55.480
If you don't feed it, it'll devour you.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.839
I gotta get out of Naples
and you gotta help me.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.559
Does Gennaro know?

21:21.079 --> 21:23.240
No and he mustn't find out.

21:26.839 --> 21:28.359
That's no good.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.880
He made his choices,
now I have to make mine.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.680
Speak to your husband first.

21:40.599 --> 21:42.559
I need liquidity.

21:43.319 --> 21:45.319
Cash can't be traced.

21:46.599 --> 21:50.160
For all these jewels
there's the provenance certificate,

21:50.240 --> 21:52.079
it won't be hard to sell them.

21:57.599 --> 21:59.640
And this is my power of attorney.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.720
Trust your husband,

22:17.799 --> 22:19.759
he knows how to protect you.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.400
He's the one I need protection from.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.759
Can't you help me?

22:33.160 --> 22:35.920
Then I'll be forced
to go to the magistrate.

22:36.839 --> 22:39.880
And I'll also accuse you
of things you haven't done.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.839
You decide, Tiziana.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.319
But if my boat sinks...

22:58.960 --> 23:00.640
you're going down with me.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.279
He doesn't believe me.

23:54.319 --> 23:57.839
He believes something,
or you'd be dead by now.

24:02.559 --> 24:03.799
Don Genna'...

24:04.559 --> 24:06.559
we're talking about Ciro Di Marzio.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.559
We're playing with fire.

24:18.319 --> 24:20.680
You've been good up to now, Fernando.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.599
But I know Ciro better than you.

24:25.680 --> 24:29.000
So we gotta put this fire out right away,
you hear me?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.559
He wants proof of loyalty.

24:47.279 --> 24:49.039
It's normal.

24:52.839 --> 24:54.759
And you give it to him.

25:21.279 --> 25:24.480
Whenever they settle
the turf accounts, he comes here.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.480
He plays the machines, gets drunk....

25:28.519 --> 25:30.759
He's always in here.

25:30.839 --> 25:32.839
Pray God this thing works out.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.839
Because it's important for them.

25:41.960 --> 25:43.759
We had a good night.

25:45.759 --> 25:47.680
There he is, it's him.

25:54.039 --> 25:55.240
Go.

26:21.079 --> 26:24.039
- What is this place?
- This is our home.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.920
So, how did it go?

26:52.640 --> 26:54.880
It's 500 grand.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.519
- Not bad, right?
- It's not that much.

26:58.160 --> 27:00.039
Don't you worry.

27:00.799 --> 27:03.839
We're growing, money's
not gonna be a problem anymore.

27:03.920 --> 27:07.319
The main thing is
we've made an attack on Gennaro.

27:09.519 --> 27:11.480
Do you trust me now?

27:12.559 --> 27:14.200
You did good.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.319
Go get some sleep, guys.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.240
See you tomorrow.

27:19.319 --> 27:20.920
- Good night.
- See ya.

28:10.319 --> 28:13.680
To save his own life,
Fernando had Franco killed.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.720
We can't trust him anymore.

28:16.799 --> 28:18.759
It was his fault he died.

28:19.680 --> 28:22.240
Fernando did it to earn Ciro's trust.

28:22.319 --> 28:25.240
And the only way was to kill one of us?

28:25.839 --> 28:29.000
To win against Ciro Di Marzio,
we all gotta make sacrifices.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.640
It could be a long, hard war,

28:32.720 --> 28:34.799
or we can win it now
thanks to Fernando.

28:36.319 --> 28:38.359
We're this close.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.720
As soon as we know
where he's hiding, we'll go for him.

28:42.799 --> 28:46.960
If Franco's death helped us
to win this war, it was worth it.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.759
You gotta have faith,
there'll be more and more of them.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.319
See how they looked at you?

29:02.559 --> 29:04.519
I know what they see.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.400
What do they see, Enzo?

29:14.440 --> 29:16.960
Hope that things can change,

29:17.039 --> 29:19.240
that's what people are lacking.

29:22.599 --> 29:24.599
You brought a new light.

29:25.319 --> 29:28.480
Thanks to you we all feel we can count.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.079
Hope, Cirù.

29:50.319 --> 29:54.759
I know where their hideout is.
In Vigliena, in a warehouse.

29:54.839 --> 29:56.839
There's nothing out there.

29:57.200 --> 30:00.440
He could get away by sea,
but he hasn't got a boat.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.079
Where can he go?

30:03.640 --> 30:07.680
When we're there, it's me, him,
Blue Blood, Pitbull and two others.

30:11.720 --> 30:12.799
Good.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.720
It all went like I said.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.920
Good job.

30:19.279 --> 30:22.039
Next time you go
and they're all there,

30:22.400 --> 30:24.359
send us a message,

30:25.160 --> 30:28.160
and we'll come and end this
for once and for all.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.319
All right.

30:39.319 --> 30:41.079
Stay ready.

31:01.079 --> 31:03.519
Gennaro really trusts Fernando, right?

31:04.440 --> 31:07.200
He's trusting a boat with no flag.

31:08.160 --> 31:12.440
But a boat with no flag is for pirates,
it changes and turns with the wind.

31:12.519 --> 31:13.680
Or not, Lil Monk?

31:16.279 --> 31:19.119
Why don't you tell Gennaro
you don't agree?

31:22.680 --> 31:25.799
Or maybe you think
he can't win against Ciro?

31:26.359 --> 31:29.400
You got the wrong idea,
you're making a mistake.

31:31.559 --> 31:33.240
Maybe.

31:34.279 --> 31:35.960
Take care, Lil Monk.

31:37.240 --> 31:38.720
Goodbye, Mistral.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.039
Yes?

32:16.839 --> 32:19.359
Cammurano Angela, Cammurano Luigi.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.559
That was my aunt's name.

32:24.799 --> 32:25.720
Thank you, Giovanni.

32:26.400 --> 32:27.599
Anything you need.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.119
You wanted to be alone?

32:58.480 --> 33:00.480
I was thinking.

33:00.559 --> 33:01.680
About what?

33:04.279 --> 33:07.160
Every time someone trusted me,
I betrayed them.

33:09.960 --> 33:11.880
It happened with Pietro too.

33:14.359 --> 33:16.559
But he made a big mistake...

33:18.640 --> 33:19.839
he underestimated me.

33:25.720 --> 33:27.359
But I know,

33:29.279 --> 33:32.279
from now on
I can't underestimate anyone.

33:34.160 --> 33:37.759
He said the same thing
when he heard you were back.

33:40.039 --> 33:42.039
Gennaro's afraid.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.559
And that's positive.

33:49.799 --> 33:51.799
Fear's not enough to kill men.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
This is also true.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.640
What would you do in my shoes?

34:03.720 --> 34:05.039
Me?

34:06.480 --> 34:07.640
Cirù...

34:08.639 --> 34:11.599
I always was, I am
and always will be a soldier.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.960
You're a trusted friend too.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.119
Fernando texted. It's time.

35:25.960 --> 35:29.119
Pray for us sinners, now
and at the hour of our death.

35:29.199 --> 35:31.960
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

36:24.320 --> 36:28.320
A friend with an auction house
in London took your jewels.

36:29.960 --> 36:32.519
The total's one million 200 thousand.

36:43.960 --> 36:44.920
Gennaro?

36:45.400 --> 36:47.159
He doesn't know anything,

36:48.199 --> 36:49.840
you have my word.

36:51.199 --> 36:53.239
You know all too well

36:53.320 --> 36:56.239
that if I'd said anything,
he'd already be here.

36:58.599 --> 36:59.599
Thanks, Tiziana.

37:02.679 --> 37:04.440
Listen to me.

37:04.519 --> 37:07.159
Do what I did: leave.

37:18.159 --> 37:20.360
Come, we gotta go.

37:29.679 --> 37:30.840
Go!

37:33.280 --> 37:34.199
Go!

40:54.239 --> 40:57.239
I'm sorry I didn't make it
to the appointment.

41:09.280 --> 41:12.039
How do your people look
at you right now?

41:14.239 --> 41:16.079
I'd like to be there too.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.119
You know, Genna'?

41:30.119 --> 41:32.519
I really thought I was dead,

41:34.960 --> 41:37.360
but you brought me back to life.

42:16.039 --> 42:17.360
Genna'?

42:21.920 --> 42:24.119
Want me to go with you?

42:47.639 --> 42:48.559
Azzurra!

42:57.440 --> 42:59.679
You know it's a miracle we're alive?

43:02.159 --> 43:04.920
Tonight, they nearly killed me
and your son.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.719
And if I'm here,

43:12.800 --> 43:15.639
it's because
it's the only option I had.

43:17.960 --> 43:20.320
Send someone to my house
to clean it up

43:21.800 --> 43:25.719
and give money to the families
of the men who protected me.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.639
