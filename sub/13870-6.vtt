00:02.048 --> 00:04.083
NATHAN: This is why we came here.

00:04.083 --> 00:06.051
Oh, nothing else matters.

00:06.052 --> 00:10.007
Gabriel. They've seen him, standing
by the lake, right where he drowned.

00:10.008 --> 00:11.999
William Payne,
from Marshfield Estate.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.059
When I was looking for Charlie,
I saw lights rushing towards me.

00:15.060 --> 00:16.087
There's a woman.

00:16.088 --> 00:19.035
A ghost. She has been present
from the very beginning,

00:19.036 --> 00:21.008
throughout all these hauntings.

00:22.044 --> 00:24.059
GIDEON: I thought Mr Denning
was going to end this.

00:24.060 --> 00:26.083
You're not welcome here, Denning!

00:26.084 --> 00:29.059
None of them will work for us again.
You do realise that?

00:29.060 --> 00:31.059
Why should there be
a scientific explanation?

00:31.060 --> 00:32.095
If there isn't, I'm going mad.

00:32.095 --> 00:34.015
That's Gabriel.

00:34.016 --> 00:36.063
I was going to tell you.
When, exactly?

00:36.064 --> 00:37.084
Leave us alone!
No! No!

00:40.040 --> 00:43.012
I can't abandon my husband, not now.

GHOSTLY LAUGHTER

01:14.020 --> 01:15.080
Show yourself.

01:19.032 --> 01:21.000
Gabriel, please.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.008
I'll do whatever it takes
to see you.

01:40.076 --> 01:45.064
GABRIEL: # Rock-a-bye baby
on the treetop

01:50.032 --> 01:53.019
# When the wind blows

01:53.020 --> 01:55.060
# The cradle will rock

02:03.024 --> 02:05.039
# When the bough breaks

02:05.040 --> 02:07.044
# The cradle will fall... #
SHE GASPS

02:23.012 --> 02:24.032
Who are you?

02:26.048 --> 02:27.080
What do you want?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.020
Help me.

02:38.020 --> 02:40.047
# This one night

02:40.048 --> 02:43.087
# This one night

02:43.088 --> 02:47.064
# Every night and all

02:49.044 --> 02:54.043
# Fire and sleet and candlelight

02:54.044 --> 02:59.056
# And Christ receive thy soul. #

03:10.008 --> 03:12.007
KNOCK AT DOOR

03:12.008 --> 03:13.080
Good morning!

03:14.084 --> 03:16.000
Good night?

03:17.040 --> 03:20.003
Fine, thanks.
Wonderful.

03:20.004 --> 03:21.092
OK. Here are your pills.

03:26.016 --> 03:27.083
Well done.

03:27.084 --> 03:30.075
Now, I've got
a nice surprise for you.

03:30.076 --> 03:32.019
You've got a visitor.

03:32.020 --> 03:33.999
So why don't you pop down
to the day room

03:34.000 --> 03:35.060
and I'll keep an eye on the baby?

03:44.028 --> 03:45.032
Lara!

03:47.040 --> 03:48.044
Sweetheart!

03:49.076 --> 03:51.055
Granny!

03:51.056 --> 03:53.076
I phoned home, and Ben told me.

03:55.076 --> 03:57.027
Is the baby OK?

03:57.028 --> 03:59.024
She's great, yeah. She's sleeping.

04:00.048 --> 04:05.035
He said you had admitted yourself
because you were seeing things.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.092
Seeing what?

04:08.064 --> 04:09.068
A little boy.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.031
Your mother saw him, too...

04:18.000 --> 04:21.035
..in the first months
after you were born.

04:21.036 --> 04:24.059
I accepted what the doctors
were saying then,

04:24.060 --> 04:28.020
that it was postnatal depression.
What are they saying about this?

04:30.068 --> 04:33.019
Er, postpartum psychosis.

04:33.020 --> 04:35.000
No, it's not.

04:49.020 --> 04:50.084
Open it.

05:03.016 --> 05:05.080
Your great-great-grandfather,
Nathan Appleby.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.048
Handsome devil!

05:21.080 --> 05:23.035
This is the boy.

05:23.036 --> 05:24.072
His son Gabriel...

05:26.088 --> 05:28.048
..who drowned.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.079
His workbook from 1894,

05:39.080 --> 05:42.032
the year my mother was conceived.

05:47.044 --> 05:49.011
This is amazing.

05:49.012 --> 05:50.068
Can I take pictures?

06:03.008 --> 06:05.023
This is their house?

06:05.024 --> 06:07.003
Shepzoy, in Somerset.

06:07.004 --> 06:09.043
We sold it when you were a baby.

06:09.044 --> 06:11.087
I hid all of this from your mother.

06:11.088 --> 06:14.055
I was wrong. I should have
let her know.

06:14.056 --> 06:16.011
I just hope you seeing this

06:16.012 --> 06:18.047
doesn't make things worse.

06:18.048 --> 06:21.051
Well, maybe that's what I need.
To get worse.

06:21.052 --> 06:23.000
To get better.

06:24.056 --> 06:26.083
She says the hallucinations
have stopped

06:26.084 --> 06:28.059
and she wants to be discharged!

06:28.060 --> 06:31.084
But only last week she's reporting
suicidal ideation.

06:32.084 --> 06:34.023
And the family history!

06:34.024 --> 06:38.007
Her mother killed herself
when Lara was three months old.

06:38.008 --> 06:39.999
No, we have to keep her in.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.035
Under section, if necessary.
Sure.

06:42.036 --> 06:45.008
OK! Say goodbye to Daddy.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.095
Oh, I wish I could just
come home with you.

06:48.096 --> 06:52.023
Me, too. But, you know,
we need to follow their advice.

06:52.024 --> 06:53.064
They're the professionals.

06:56.032 --> 06:59.051
Erm, I think I've left
Squeaky Giraffe in the day room.

06:59.052 --> 07:03.032
I'll go! Are you sure?
Yeah. OK. Thank you.

07:04.032 --> 07:05.055
Where's Daddy going?

07:05.056 --> 07:07.039
Er, the day room is...
down the end?

07:07.040 --> 07:08.072
Er, down the end, yeah.

07:09.076 --> 07:11.096
Where's Daddy going?
DOOR CLOSES

07:55.036 --> 07:57.051
'Hey. This is Lara.
Leave a message.'

07:57.052 --> 07:59.003
BEN: 'Hey. It's me.

07:59.004 --> 08:01.999
'Er, my keys are gone, Lottie's gone

08:02.000 --> 08:03.047
'and you're gone.

08:03.048 --> 08:05.067
'I'm a bit freaked out.
So please just give me a call,

08:05.068 --> 08:07.071
'just let me know you're all right

08:07.072 --> 08:11.036
'and...let me know she's
all right, please. I love you.'

08:35.063 --> 08:37.063
This is it.
LOTTIE GURGLES

08:38.063 --> 08:39.096
You want to go inside?

09:08.088 --> 09:10.071
Mr Payne's here for you, ma'am.

09:10.072 --> 09:12.087
Now is really not
the best time, Gwen.

09:12.088 --> 09:14.083
I could tell him you're not here.

09:14.084 --> 09:16.047
You've told him I am here.

09:16.048 --> 09:19.015
Have you seen my husband?

09:19.016 --> 09:20.095
CHARLOTTE SIGHS

09:20.096 --> 09:22.015
Good morning, Mr Payne!

09:22.016 --> 09:26.047
Oh, good morning, Mrs Appleby.
I hope I do not disturb your rest.

09:26.048 --> 09:29.091
Not at all. I cannot laze, sadly.
I have a farm to manage.

09:29.092 --> 09:32.096
Oh, no, please, no, I'm...I'm not
suggesting indolence, I'm...

09:34.028 --> 09:37.015
Well, I'm merely being
sensitive to your, er....

09:37.016 --> 09:38.019
Condition?

09:38.020 --> 09:41.020
Yes. Yes, the mot juste.

09:42.016 --> 09:45.087
So, how can I help you, Mr Payne?
Your husband is indisposed?

09:45.088 --> 09:47.016
He is out.

09:48.016 --> 09:50.055
But you can deal with me.
I'm grateful.

09:50.056 --> 09:52.027
I have a proposition.

09:52.028 --> 09:53.040
DOOR CLOSES

09:54.064 --> 09:57.076
Your husband, he just walked past.

10:01.012 --> 10:02.024
Mr Payne?

10:03.028 --> 10:04.072
Oh, Mr Appleby!

10:05.068 --> 10:07.056
Glad to see you, sir.
Yes...

10:09.000 --> 10:10.043
I hope you do not miss too sorely

10:10.044 --> 10:12.055
the workers who have recently
left your farm.

10:12.056 --> 10:15.008
A lack of faith, perhaps.
We do not lack faith.

10:16.060 --> 10:18.084
NATHAN CHUCKLES

10:22.012 --> 10:23.071
What do you want?

10:23.072 --> 10:26.011
I would like to buy
the two acres of marshy land

10:26.012 --> 10:28.091
that border my estate.
By the lane? It's worthless.

10:28.092 --> 10:33.027
Well, not to me. I intend to drain
the field on my side, to pump it.

10:33.028 --> 10:35.071
That's ambitious. Of course,
I'd pay you well for it.

10:35.072 --> 10:37.027
Of course you would,

10:37.028 --> 10:42.043
advancing with your speculator's
fortune, step by step,

10:42.044 --> 10:44.027
parading your innovation

10:44.028 --> 10:46.031
and determination...

10:46.032 --> 10:47.083
qualities my wife admires...

10:47.084 --> 10:50.023
Nathan, I don't think...
..until, one night...

10:50.024 --> 10:54.003
I feel this tap on my shoulder
and I turn to find you here

10:54.004 --> 10:55.067
in my house.

10:55.068 --> 10:59.031
I don't think Mr Payne is plotting
the occupation you imply.

10:59.032 --> 11:01.091
I merely jest, my dear!

11:01.092 --> 11:04.016
My dear! And my dear sir!

11:05.020 --> 11:06.056
In neighbourly fun.

11:07.056 --> 11:09.019
NATHAN LAUGHS

11:09.020 --> 11:12.004
The bog is yours,
if my wife is willing.

11:17.008 --> 11:18.067
He has been working late,

11:18.068 --> 11:20.051
writing.

11:20.052 --> 11:21.064
A gifted man.

11:22.068 --> 11:24.072
If you will give me
just one moment...

11:31.096 --> 11:35.075
I have been through hell, too,
and suffered this madness.

11:35.076 --> 11:37.075
But can we at least
appear competent?

11:37.076 --> 11:41.063
I thought you wanted more energy
from me, more animation.

11:41.064 --> 11:44.007
It feels like you're freezing over.

11:44.008 --> 11:47.031
This is not the time to talk.
That is what you said to me,

11:47.032 --> 11:50.048
that I'd lost
the spring in my step.

11:51.064 --> 11:54.003
He's waiting for me.

11:54.004 --> 11:56.043
I'm going with him
to look at the land,

11:56.044 --> 11:58.063
because we need money to pay wages.

11:58.064 --> 12:00.999
To keep...going.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.019
HE SCOFFS

12:02.020 --> 12:04.012
You sound like
you don't want to. Oh?

12:05.064 --> 12:07.035
No, I'm just a...

12:07.036 --> 12:10.036
a little tired. I didn't sleep.

12:11.096 --> 12:14.024
Good man, I think.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.048
An ideal husband.

12:28.032 --> 12:31.047
So the boundary would move
half a furlong west?

12:31.048 --> 12:33.087
I have the charts back at
the house, if you have the time.

12:33.088 --> 12:35.059
Oh, certainly, let's get it done.

12:35.060 --> 12:37.027
Oh!

12:37.028 --> 12:39.011
One moment.

12:39.012 --> 12:40.083
I'll unhitch you.

12:40.084 --> 12:42.084
SHE LAUGHS

12:44.016 --> 12:45.072
Thank you.

12:49.032 --> 12:52.015
I'm very interested
in your photography.

12:52.016 --> 12:54.075
In fact, I've begun to dabble
myself, I blush to admit.

12:54.076 --> 12:56.023
Really?

12:56.024 --> 12:58.068
I would value your expert advice.

13:06.048 --> 13:08.055
SHE SIGHS

13:08.056 --> 13:10.032
Mr Appleby?

13:12.012 --> 13:14.035
You look alarmed.

13:14.036 --> 13:16.031
You took me for a ghost...
No!

13:16.032 --> 13:17.084
..of my former self.

13:18.096 --> 13:20.063
Can I make you some breakfast?

13:20.064 --> 13:24.011
Thank you, no. My appetite
seems to have...waned.

13:24.012 --> 13:26.027
But...your remedies?

13:26.028 --> 13:28.020
Your hedgewitch cures.

13:29.020 --> 13:31.008
I have a mind to see those.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.080
Ohhh!

14:02.028 --> 14:04.008
Psilocybin mushrooms?

14:05.056 --> 14:08.043
To help explore a difficulty,
to see it,

14:08.044 --> 14:10.080
to feel it differently.

14:12.020 --> 14:13.071
To be used with caution.

14:13.072 --> 14:17.087
I saw them administered once
to two melancholy patients,

14:17.088 --> 14:22.047
and one broke through her malaise,
emerging much shaken but better.

14:22.048 --> 14:24.051
The other, he did not.

14:24.052 --> 14:27.023
He saw more than his doctor
bargained for,

14:27.024 --> 14:29.008
things...

14:30.072 --> 14:32.027
He wishes he could unsee?

14:32.028 --> 14:35.056
Exactly. Then took his own life.

14:38.024 --> 14:39.084
HE SIGHS

14:40.084 --> 14:42.039
A gamble.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.060
Kill or cure.

14:48.084 --> 14:50.003
Deadly nightshade.

14:50.004 --> 14:52.055
Er, I've only used
the tiniest trace

14:52.056 --> 14:56.095
as medicine. More could be
the death of you.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.056
I see now why you lock it.

15:04.052 --> 15:05.096
Thank you, Gwen.

15:17.044 --> 15:19.055
I can alight here, thank you.

15:19.056 --> 15:20.060
Whoa...

15:21.084 --> 15:22.092
No, please.

15:25.072 --> 15:28.043
I'll have the papers drawn up
and sent over.

15:28.044 --> 15:29.075
Thank you.

15:29.076 --> 15:31.059
My pleasure.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.043
Gideon!

15:33.044 --> 15:35.056
How are the turnips?
Oh, not too bad, ma'am.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.011
It's cold on your fingers.

15:40.012 --> 15:42.039
I'm sorry we're so short-handed.
Oh, not to worry.

15:42.040 --> 15:45.088
Them that's gone
got fainter hearts than some.

15:47.008 --> 15:48.040
Maybe we don't need 'em.

15:50.072 --> 15:52.004
Thank you!

15:54.052 --> 15:56.036
You saw me with Mr Payne.

15:57.072 --> 15:59.091
I'm selling...
Well, WE'RE selling him

15:59.092 --> 16:01.055
the marshy acres on his boundary.

16:01.056 --> 16:03.051
There's a bit of
old machinery up there.

16:03.052 --> 16:05.003
Do you think we could dig it up?

16:05.004 --> 16:06.091
Do you think
that's what he's after?

16:06.092 --> 16:09.043
SHE LAUGHS
Buried treasure? No.

16:09.044 --> 16:12.047
Come into the kitchen for some
warm cider brandy when you're done.

16:12.048 --> 16:13.064
Thanks, ma'am.

16:27.004 --> 16:29.092
Why can't I see them any more?

16:36.044 --> 16:41.044
How can I hope to see
when you, dear wife, distract me?

16:48.096 --> 16:51.019
Sorry to see you leaving.

16:51.020 --> 16:52.095
This place is cursed. We need to go.

16:52.096 --> 16:55.080
May the Lord watch over you.
And you. Goodbye, Reverend.

16:57.020 --> 16:58.024
Mrs Appleby!

16:59.024 --> 17:00.060
How are you?

17:01.064 --> 17:03.023
It's cold.

17:03.024 --> 17:05.064
Let's go to the Wheatsheaf
and sit down by the fire.

17:08.016 --> 17:10.011
Warm sugar water
with just a dash of brandy.

17:10.012 --> 17:11.035
Thank you.

17:11.036 --> 17:13.076
And how is your husband?

17:14.084 --> 17:16.076
There's a question.
Mm.

17:18.092 --> 17:20.044
Somewhat remote.

17:21.076 --> 17:23.012
More so every day.

17:25.048 --> 17:28.011
And our baby's growing inside me,
and I don't know what to do.

17:28.012 --> 17:30.064
I'm so sorry.
You poor child.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.096
Let me talk to him.

17:43.052 --> 17:44.080
Thank you.

17:48.064 --> 17:49.072
SHE SIGHS

17:59.008 --> 18:00.044
Lost your flock?

18:01.080 --> 18:04.004
Always hope to find one gone astray.

18:05.052 --> 18:10.035
I'm sorry, Denning,
for mishandling you...

18:10.036 --> 18:12.004
and your daughter.

18:13.036 --> 18:15.016
But I'm best left alone now.

18:16.072 --> 18:18.083
I spoke to Charlotte.

18:18.084 --> 18:21.027
She fears for your happiness.

18:21.028 --> 18:23.055
Ah, but we cannot all
be scintillatingly zestful

18:23.056 --> 18:25.087
morning, noon and night.

18:25.088 --> 18:29.059
What is happiness?
A man needs peace of mind.

18:29.060 --> 18:31.083
You have your faith.
You should be in a monastery.

18:31.084 --> 18:33.071
If I had it, I would be.
I'd sit in a cell.

18:33.072 --> 18:35.999
I would watch the light
move from wall to wall.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.999
I would contemplate eternity.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.024
You would not miss the world?
No. Or your wife?

18:41.064 --> 18:43.028
Or the child that is coming?

18:44.048 --> 18:45.999
I had a child.
I know.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.059
I lost him.

18:47.060 --> 18:50.087
And as this one comes closer...

18:50.088 --> 18:52.040
you feel that grief again.

18:53.092 --> 18:56.064
And fear. Fear that
you'll lose it, too?

18:59.036 --> 19:00.052
Not fear.

19:02.076 --> 19:04.055
Guilt.

19:04.056 --> 19:07.035
Ah!
This pregnancy is a gift.

19:07.036 --> 19:10.063
There should be no shame
in accepting it.

19:10.064 --> 19:12.047
A gift from God?

19:12.048 --> 19:15.067
So it was God who took my son away,

19:15.068 --> 19:18.027
sending down this angel
with her book of light to lead him

19:18.028 --> 19:22.007
to his doom, she who appeared to
your daughter and to me? I fear...

19:22.008 --> 19:24.003
I fear she hasn't, Denning.

19:24.004 --> 19:27.051
His soul is living. His soul, in
which you believe, is not at peace.

19:27.052 --> 19:29.011
He's isolated, he's tormented.

19:29.012 --> 19:32.051
It's YOU you are describing!

19:32.052 --> 19:36.047
You! In purgatory,
unable to move on.

19:36.048 --> 19:40.059
And it's you pulling others
into your unhappiness.

19:40.060 --> 19:42.051
My daughter. The village.

19:42.052 --> 19:45.052
It's you, Nathan!

19:46.052 --> 19:48.027
Me?

19:48.028 --> 19:49.080
The lost soul?

19:51.080 --> 19:53.020
I must find a way out.

19:57.020 --> 19:58.052
You love your wife.

19:59.084 --> 20:01.044
And she loves you.

20:02.060 --> 20:04.000
You be with her now.

20:06.056 --> 20:07.087
Not the dead.

20:07.088 --> 20:09.076
Sensible advice. Thank you...

24:47.032 --> 24:49.052
I know who you are, Gabriel.

24:51.040 --> 24:53.020
You lived here.

24:55.092 --> 24:58.048
I want to help you,
but I don't know how.

24:59.096 --> 25:03.080
Your father clearly wanted to see
you. Why didn't you appear to him?

25:06.008 --> 25:07.023
What can I do?

25:07.024 --> 25:08.084
He wants a new baby.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.063
Yes.

25:11.064 --> 25:12.067
No.

25:12.068 --> 25:14.095
But... But that doesn't...

25:14.096 --> 25:16.036
Gabriel?

25:34.044 --> 25:36.064
DOOR OPENS

25:38.016 --> 25:40.003
Lost your knuckles?

25:40.004 --> 25:42.004
My what?
Your knuckles.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.080
So you can't knock.

25:46.092 --> 25:49.043
I didn't realise your privacy
was so important.

25:49.044 --> 25:50.092
It's not a question of...

25:52.088 --> 25:55.999
..privacy. What are you writing?
Love letters?

25:56.000 --> 25:57.091
It's a question of peace.

25:57.092 --> 25:59.080
A question of peace.

26:00.080 --> 26:03.036
You don't want it, do you?
I don't want what?

26:04.060 --> 26:05.092
This baby.

26:09.048 --> 26:10.080
Wait.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.071
Charlotte?

26:15.072 --> 26:19.007
Shall I fall down the stairs
and give you your miscarriage?

26:19.008 --> 26:20.032
No, of course not.

26:21.072 --> 26:23.016
That's what you want.

26:24.072 --> 26:26.083
I can feel it, like ice.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.076
Why would I want you to miscarry?

26:31.064 --> 26:33.072
Because you cannot bear
to be a father again.

26:37.064 --> 26:39.024
I'm going to go.

26:41.052 --> 26:43.035
Go where?
Away from your cold eyes.

26:43.036 --> 26:46.027
What do you think I'll do,
freeze the baby in your womb?

26:46.028 --> 26:49.075
And you look at me as if
I'm the mad one. But it's you.

26:49.076 --> 26:51.095
You're afraid...

26:51.096 --> 26:55.019
of giving birth, of motherhood,

26:55.020 --> 26:58.011
and so you project this infanticidal
urge onto me, making me

26:58.012 --> 27:00.031
the thing you fear,
which is not only unfair...

27:00.032 --> 27:01.055
but stupid!

27:01.056 --> 27:03.003
And you're so clever,

27:03.004 --> 27:05.083
because you found a profession
where you could feel less damaged

27:05.084 --> 27:07.059
because everyone else
is damaged more.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.031
Oh?
And now, down here,

27:09.032 --> 27:12.015
you have to face it. There's
something wrong with your mind.

27:12.016 --> 27:13.063
Oh, Dr Charlotte!

27:13.064 --> 27:15.067
And your heart.
So young and yet so wise.

27:15.068 --> 27:16.096
And your soul!

27:18.048 --> 27:19.063
Ah, I can't.

27:19.064 --> 27:21.012
Can't what?

27:22.024 --> 27:25.036
Recall what I liked about you.

28:46.004 --> 28:47.027
Is the mistress here?

28:47.028 --> 28:48.032
No.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.016
Take a few days off.

28:52.028 --> 28:53.040
Sir?
Now.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.031
Where is she?

28:58.032 --> 28:59.040
She's gone.

the better.

29:22.040 --> 29:24.088
So, this must be...the kitchen!

29:28.012 --> 29:31.011
Wow. Look at this place now, Granny!

29:31.012 --> 29:33.020
I'm filming it for YOU.

29:35.044 --> 29:38.091
Hm. You may not want to see it,
though. It feels so...

29:38.092 --> 29:40.044
abandoned.

29:45.072 --> 29:48.039
I knew I had to come here.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.088
I know I'm somehow part of this.

29:52.052 --> 29:55.004
But I don't know what part.

30:22.060 --> 30:23.063

you were here at the vicarage,

With a pineapple.

34:29.027 --> 34:30.031
Yes.

34:30.032 --> 34:34.047
I read that tropical fruits might be

34:34.047 --> 34:37.007
It may of course be hogwash.
Thank you, Mr Payne.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.048
Come on, Daddy. What?
I'm going to sail my boat.

36:11.052 --> 36:13.008
MUSIC ECHOES

36:29.004 --> 36:30.016
Gabriel!

36:32.072 --> 36:33.076
Gabriel!

36:40.012 --> 36:41.024
Gabriel!

36:42.024 --> 36:43.079
GABRIEL SCREAMS

36:43.080 --> 36:45.076
Daddy!
SPLASH

36:52.088 --> 36:54.067
Gabriel!

36:54.068 --> 36:56.055
Gabriel!

36:56.056 --> 36:58.079
Gabriel!

36:58.080 --> 37:00.052
Gabriel!

37:04.020 --> 37:06.008
HE WAILS

37:13.048 --> 37:15.016
Gabriel!

37:53.024 --> 37:55.044
HE SOBS

38:01.008 --> 38:03.004
I'm coming. Mummy's coming.

38:04.048 --> 38:06.056
What have you done with my son?!

38:11.036 --> 38:13.020
Gabriel?

38:21.052 --> 38:22.067
Gabriel!

38:22.068 --> 38:25.015
NATHAN BREATHES UNSTEADILY

38:25.016 --> 38:27.008
HE LAUGHS

38:34.080 --> 38:36.079
Is she here?

38:36.080 --> 38:38.056
No-one's here. I'm on my own.

38:40.048 --> 38:42.039
NATHAN LAUGHS UNCERTAINLY

38:42.040 --> 38:44.023
I've been looking for you.

38:44.024 --> 38:46.036
I've been hiding.

38:47.064 --> 38:50.087
You... You didn't want
to...see me?

38:50.088 --> 38:52.087
You didn't want to see me.

38:52.088 --> 38:54.044
Oh, Gabriel!

38:55.060 --> 38:57.067
I would give anything.

38:57.068 --> 38:59.095
Stay with me, Daddy. Look after me.

38:59.096 --> 39:02.035
How? How can I do that?

39:02.036 --> 39:04.020
You know how.

39:33.012 --> 39:34.028
Nathan?

39:36.092 --> 39:38.044
Nathan Appleby?

39:40.068 --> 39:42.076
Do you want to know who I am?

39:44.040 --> 39:46.072
I'm your
great-great-granddaughter...

39:49.036 --> 39:53.079
..and I'm...I'm not trying
to haunt you or your son...

39:53.080 --> 39:56.036
or anyone. OK?

39:59.072 --> 40:01.076
I just want to get on with my life.

40:03.092 --> 40:05.064
I just want to go home!
SHE SOBS

40:08.068 --> 40:11.004
I just need proof I'm not mad.

40:14.016 --> 40:17.052
You've seen me, Nathan.
Let me see you.

40:26.072 --> 40:28.044
SHE GASPS AND SCREAMS

40:51.032 --> 40:52.080
Where is she?

40:57.040 --> 40:58.056
Where is she?

40:59.084 --> 41:01.007
Where is she?!

41:01.008 --> 41:02.059
BEN: 'Lara, are you OK?'

41:02.060 --> 41:07.003
Look, I'm sorry that I left
like that and I took the car.

41:07.004 --> 41:08.055
'Is Lottie OK? What's going on?'

41:08.056 --> 41:11.035
I had to come here...

41:11.036 --> 41:13.027
to face what's haunting me,

41:13.028 --> 41:15.039
what haunted my mother, to...

41:15.040 --> 41:16.055
'Yeah.'

41:16.056 --> 41:20.035
..to somehow stop it, you see?
Stop it from haunting Lottie.

41:20.036 --> 41:23.035
'The police are getting involved.
You are ill, Lara. You need help.'

41:23.036 --> 41:26.055
I'm not ill. You see,
I thought I was, but I'm not.

41:26.056 --> 41:29.003
'OK. So let me come and get you.'

41:29.004 --> 41:31.008
You know where I am.

41:33.004 --> 41:35.079
Sylvia told you.
'It's all right. Just...'

41:35.080 --> 41:37.012
PHONE BEEPS

42:20.068 --> 42:21.075
SHE GASPS

42:21.076 --> 42:23.016
TYRES SCREECH

42:37.024 --> 42:38.096
Daddy's coming.

42:41.036 --> 42:42.080
What do you mean?

42:43.080 --> 42:45.024
Daddy's coming!

43:35.000 --> 43:36.079
CHARLOTTE: 'There's just you and me.

43:36.080 --> 43:39.084
'And we're alive, Nathan Appleby.'

44:42.032 --> 44:45.071
So the essential thing
is timing? Yes.

44:45.072 --> 44:49.003
And the amount of light you admit.
Like the moment that you capture

44:49.004 --> 44:51.016
between the taker and the taken.

44:58.012 --> 44:59.075
Forgive me, Mr Payne,

44:59.076 --> 45:01.092
I must go home to my husband.

45:29.060 --> 45:31.072
No, Nathan. Stop!

45:43.072 --> 45:45.000
He's killing himself.

45:46.012 --> 45:48.999
What about his wife and baby?

45:49.000 --> 45:50.079
They can come, too.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.047
No.

45:52.048 --> 45:54.052
No!

45:58.008 --> 46:00.060
PAYNE: Please, wait!

46:03.052 --> 46:06.036
I fear for you, for both of you...

46:07.084 --> 46:11.031
..in your condition,
in his desperate state... Please...

46:11.032 --> 46:13.059
I implore you, stop.

46:13.060 --> 46:15.075
Just for a moment.

46:15.076 --> 46:19.011
I understand that you love him
and that you want to help him,

46:19.012 --> 46:22.067
but sometimes a man needs to be
left to lick his own wounds.

46:22.068 --> 46:24.028
Just give him one more day alone.

46:26.044 --> 46:29.039
You can return to him tomorrow.

46:29.040 --> 46:31.076
Please let me drive you
back to the vicarage.

46:40.088 --> 46:42.060
LARA: Charlotte!

46:49.036 --> 46:51.007
He's going to kill himself.

46:51.008 --> 46:52.092
SHE GASPS

46:54.032 --> 46:56.019
What's the matter?

46:56.020 --> 46:57.023
No.

46:57.024 --> 46:59.063
Must I force you, like a lunatic,
for your own good?

46:59.064 --> 47:00.096
Unhand me.

47:38.020 --> 47:39.096
Good to see you.

47:41.056 --> 47:43.000
Good to see you, too.

47:46.048 --> 47:48.024
I'm sorry, I have to do this.

47:52.064 --> 47:54.019
How did we get here?

47:54.020 --> 47:56.063
We were going to be so happy.

47:56.064 --> 47:57.076
My fault.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.064
I was damaged when you met me.

48:02.024 --> 48:03.055
Deeper than I knew.

48:03.056 --> 48:05.072
Your secret ingredient.

48:06.092 --> 48:09.035
Your insoluble grief.

48:09.036 --> 48:11.095
That you could not resist.

48:11.096 --> 48:15.019
I believed that one day
I'd find a solution,

48:15.020 --> 48:16.080
I might be the solution...

48:19.020 --> 48:21.024
..and that just by being with you...

48:25.060 --> 48:26.091
..I would erode it.

48:26.092 --> 48:28.044
You did.

48:29.092 --> 48:31.052
You made me so happy.

48:33.008 --> 48:34.011
But...

48:34.012 --> 48:35.059
But?

48:35.060 --> 48:37.004
I've seen him.

48:38.036 --> 48:39.072
He's out there.

48:41.036 --> 48:42.088
I've spoken to him.

48:44.008 --> 48:46.031
An inch away. A moment.

48:46.032 --> 48:48.055
If you believe it, I believe it.

48:48.056 --> 48:50.008
Thank you.

48:51.004 --> 48:54.027
I think I've known for some time.

48:54.028 --> 48:56.032
Maybe even from the beginning.

48:57.052 --> 48:58.072
You want to join him?

49:01.020 --> 49:02.091
You want to leave me?

49:02.092 --> 49:04.008
No.

49:07.008 --> 49:08.035
But I have to.

49:08.036 --> 49:09.068
No. You don't.

49:12.016 --> 49:13.036
Let's go together.

49:16.072 --> 49:18.028
Let me drink first.

49:22.032 --> 49:23.096
Trust me.

49:28.060 --> 49:31.028
Is it strong enough for both of us?

49:34.032 --> 49:35.071
You don't have to do this.

49:35.072 --> 49:37.063
I do.

49:37.064 --> 49:40.008
Because I can't live without you.

49:47.040 --> 49:49.000
No!
GLASS SMASHES

NATHAN SOBS

50:05.076 --> 50:07.059
I'm sorry I...

50:07.060 --> 50:09.012
I failed you!

50:10.052 --> 50:14.024
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...I...

50:15.072 --> 50:17.008
..I let you die.

50:23.016 --> 50:24.080
I love you.

50:36.040 --> 50:37.060
He's gone.

50:42.012 --> 50:43.028
He's gone.

50:45.028 --> 50:47.056
HE SOBS
Shhh... Hey...

50:55.080 --> 50:57.032
I love you so much.

50:59.080 --> 51:01.056
I love you, too.

51:18.004 --> 51:19.008
Sir.

51:20.068 --> 51:22.095
Ma'am!

51:22.096 --> 51:24.060
You're here!

51:26.024 --> 51:29.016
It's a tonic, sure,
to see the pair of you together.

51:30.016 --> 51:31.999
Thank you.
Thank you, Gideon.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.040
We've been digging the old machine
out of the east marsh.

51:35.060 --> 51:37.039
I think you should see it.

51:37.040 --> 51:39.056
Go on! Hup, hup, hup, hup!

52:12.040 --> 52:14.095
GWEN: Perhaps this is what was
troubling the land.

52:14.096 --> 52:16.080
DENNING: If it was,
it's all over now.

Her father came and took her home.

53:24.096 --> 53:27.055
She's with her daddy.

53:27.056 --> 53:29.004
Was she hurt?

53:30.068 --> 53:32.044
She's safe.

You're my mummy now.

Welcome to the land of the living.

Why did you kill your wife?

# Meat or drink thou never gave

# Every night and all

# The fire shall burn thee

# And Christ receive thy soul. #
