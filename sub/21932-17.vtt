Look at the craftsmanship
on that horse, Crabtree.

00:49.948 --> 00:51.843
In time, that will become
a treasured heirloom.

00:51.975 --> 00:54.006
Sir, what does a child
care about an heirloom?

00:54.116 --> 00:56.148
That toy car, that's the thing.
Don't be daft.

00:56.216 --> 00:59.251
- What if it's a girl?
- Sir, girls enjoy cars

00:59.320 --> 01:02.321
- just as much as boys, I believe.
- I'm sure a girl would enjoy

01:02.389 --> 01:04.989
a car as much as a boy.
Although for a baby,

01:05.058 --> 01:06.889
perhaps a teddy bear.

01:07.256 --> 01:09.124
Well, that's
that surprise ruined.

I've always wanted
one of those spinning tops.

We'll make a note to get
you one for your own kid

01:14.101 --> 01:15.655
when the time comes.

01:16.988 --> 01:18.244
In fact, Crabtree,

01:18.313 --> 01:21.381
do yourself a favour and marry
that pretty dancer of yours.

01:21.569 --> 01:22.808
Then stick her up the duff.

01:22.876 --> 01:25.010
Sir! Nina is...

01:25.079 --> 01:26.577
a free spirit.

01:26.765 --> 01:28.772
I hesitate to push her
into something that...

01:28.896 --> 01:31.460
well, that essentially would be
a lifelong commitment.

01:31.529 --> 01:33.810
I mean, even more so than
marriage, if you think about it.

01:33.975 --> 01:35.483
Take the bull
by the horns, Crabtree.

01:35.552 --> 01:37.453
Tell her it's your way
or no way.

01:37.668 --> 01:40.092
I'm not sure
that's a good idea, sir.

01:40.161 --> 01:43.085
Well, it might be unwise
to force her decision, sir,

01:43.233 --> 01:45.639
but I would like to have a
family of my own at some point.

01:45.967 --> 01:47.429
It's been weighing
on me more lately,

01:47.498 --> 01:49.230

of your happy news, sir.

what happened yesterday.

13:15.618 --> 13:17.643
You got in a fight
with Mr. Lewis?

13:20.317 --> 13:23.911
Yeah. On the street outside
the pub he favours, yes.

13:25.285 --> 13:27.677
But I only punched him.

13:27.879 --> 13:31.020
He walked away after.
It was... it was no murder.

13:31.653 --> 13:33.153
Why the fight?

13:34.285 --> 13:37.517
- He owed me money.
- And he wouldn't pay?

13:37.700 --> 13:39.919
Well, he said he didn't
have any money.

13:40.106 --> 13:43.247
He shoved me, said he didn't owe
me a thing. That's when I hit him.

13:43.411 --> 13:45.505
Look, I know I made a mistake.

13:45.770 --> 13:47.684
I couldn't help myself.

13:48.176 --> 13:51.200
Well, I suppose that's
why the Inspector here believes

13:51.277 --> 13:53.762
you couldn't help yourself
later that night either.

13:53.887 --> 13:56.325
Well, no!
That was hours later.

13:56.528 --> 13:58.850
I had come to my senses by then.

14:00.787 --> 14:02.679
So it was just
a coincidence, then?

14:02.950 --> 14:05.357
Charlie Lewis getting beaten
to death in his apartment

14:05.434 --> 14:08.067
hours after you had
a fight with him.

14:11.231 --> 14:15.184
Nate insists he never
visited Mr. Lewis at his home.

14:15.575 --> 14:16.926
And you believed him?

14:16.994 --> 14:19.829
Even authenticity can
be faked, in my experience.

14:19.911 --> 14:22.707
Indeed. The newspaper
said there were witnesses.

14:22.784 --> 14:24.036
Oh, yes.

14:24.590 --> 14:27.170
As much of the case file
as Robinson could manage

14:27.239 --> 14:29.044
to copy out for us.
I have their names.

14:29.113 --> 14:30.606
Very good.

14:35.887 --> 14:38.314
Sir, this is Eugene Lough.

14:38.391 --> 14:40.583
He lives across
from our victim there.

14:42.604 --> 14:45.730
Mr. Lough. I understand
you saw a man

14:45.856 --> 14:48.419
the night of the murder.
Oh, I didn't see anyone.

14:48.559 --> 14:51.208
What I did is I heard an
argument in Charlie's apartment.

14:51.473 --> 14:55.176
Voices... around midnight.

14:55.364 --> 14:57.266
And then bangs and thuds.

14:57.343 --> 14:59.411
And you didn't check in
on your neighbour?

14:59.488 --> 15:02.465
Well, to tell you the truth,
arguments were never anything new.

15:02.615 --> 15:05.150
Charlie and his wife Isabel
had many quarrels.

15:05.728 --> 15:08.762
His wife? Do you
know where she is?

15:09.348 --> 15:11.450
Visiting her mother,
I believe.

15:11.731 --> 15:13.193
Then after the bangs and thuds,

15:13.262 --> 15:15.653
I heard a man escape
down the back stairs.

15:15.864 --> 15:17.661
If you didn't see him,

15:17.770 --> 15:19.097
how are you sure it was a man?

15:19.182 --> 15:22.566
I heard the fight.
It was a man.

15:23.286 --> 15:24.942
I was standing right here.

15:25.051 --> 15:26.905
No one uses the back stairs,
so of course

15:26.982 --> 15:29.131
it attracted my attention. A man

15:29.200 --> 15:32.090
came out of Mr. Lewis' back door
and ran right down there.

15:32.325 --> 15:34.364
I got a good look at him,
clear as day.

15:34.575 --> 15:36.403
You all... bachelors?

15:36.520 --> 15:39.317
- I am, indeed.
- If I may, sir,

15:39.450 --> 15:41.473
what were you doing
in the alleyway at midnight?

15:41.676 --> 15:44.631
I like to take my last pipe
of the night outside.

15:44.700 --> 15:48.061
We have what they call bachelor
flats to let at a reasonable rent

15:48.130 --> 15:50.067

such as yourself.

15:50.136 --> 15:53.294
Ahem. How did you see his face
if it was dark?

15:53.473 --> 15:54.933
It is a ways away from here.

15:55.137 --> 15:56.958
There's a lamp right there.

15:57.404 --> 15:59.512
Besides, I've seen him since.
That other policeman

15:59.581 --> 16:02.137
brought a man by this morning,
asked if I recognized him.

16:02.387 --> 16:04.333
- And did you?
- You bet I did.

16:04.426 --> 16:06.881
I could see right away
they had the exact same man.

16:06.950 --> 16:08.747
Could've knocked me over
they go him so fast.

16:09.044 --> 16:11.216
Said his name was Desmond.

16:14.278 --> 16:17.809
Oh. Do you have an address
for Isabelle Lewis' mother?

16:17.942 --> 16:19.717
I could find it for you.
And after that,

16:19.786 --> 16:22.020
I'll show you
our best apartment.

16:22.704 --> 16:24.215
Hmm.

16:24.667 --> 16:27.551
Now, this is
Charlie Lewis' apartment.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.169
No sign of forced entry.

16:30.340 --> 16:31.387
McWorthy's theory

16:31.456 --> 16:34.301
was that Mr. Lewis
was ambushed near the door.

16:34.637 --> 16:36.770
So the blood spatter
would suggest.

16:36.981 --> 16:38.368
Good lord.

16:39.372 --> 16:41.038
Ransacked belongings.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.200
Perhaps Isabel Lewis came back

16:44.294 --> 16:46.075
to get some of her things.

16:46.153 --> 16:48.311
She heard her husband
approaching, so she hid

16:48.380 --> 16:50.387
behind the door with
the fireplace poker in hand.

16:50.544 --> 16:53.715
Possibly, but that's
a lot of speculation.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.519
Why Mrs. Lewis
and not anyone else,

16:56.684 --> 16:58.817
even your man Desmond?

16:59.314 --> 17:00.833
Hmm.

17:08.617 --> 17:10.200
Oh, hello.

17:11.009 --> 17:13.111

17:17.172 --> 17:18.259

17:18.328 --> 17:20.612
who that's from.
I have lots of old letters.

17:20.681 --> 17:22.646
Maybe Charlie put them
in the fire.

17:24.266 --> 17:26.829
When did you last see
your husband, Mrs. Lewis?

17:27.220 --> 17:28.641
Not since Sunday.

17:28.899 --> 17:31.204
We argued, and I...

17:31.993 --> 17:33.884
I wanted to visit my mother.

17:34.089 --> 17:36.352
This is all very hard
on Isabel.

17:36.743 --> 17:38.813
Charlie was a good husband.

17:39.087 --> 17:40.963
He wanted to have children.

17:41.172 --> 17:42.873
Such a tragedy!
He would've been

17:42.942 --> 17:45.602
a terrible father.
Don't you see what he did to me?

17:45.743 --> 17:48.727
- What?! Charlie did that?
- Yes, Mother.

17:51.447 --> 17:53.239
All... right then.

17:53.347 --> 17:55.440
Mrs. Lewis, where were you

17:55.509 --> 17:58.212
at about midnight of last night?
I was here.

17:58.282 --> 18:00.657
Asleep.
And is that something

18:00.829 --> 18:03.502
your mother could corroborate?
Of course I'm sure my Isabel

18:03.571 --> 18:05.563
is telling the truth,
but strictly speaking,

18:05.632 --> 18:07.759
I... can't.
It's all right, Mother.

18:07.970 --> 18:10.423
You see, I was out nursing
a sick neighbour all night.

18:10.585 --> 18:14.985
Very good. Just one moment.

18:16.899 --> 18:19.298

18:19.727 --> 18:21.196
Yes, fine.

25:29.956 --> 25:31.904
Would you like your neighbours
to know that your daughter

25:31.972 --> 25:33.652
- is suspected of a crime?
- No!

25:33.721 --> 25:35.949
And, of course,
we won't have to do that

25:36.059 --> 25:37.951
as long as you're
telling us the truth.

25:38.542 --> 25:40.339
Tell us the truth!

25:40.557 --> 25:43.159
What did your daughter do on
the day of her husband's murder?

25:43.324 --> 25:45.495
Did she see any visitors?
She was afraid to so much

25:45.564 --> 25:47.175
as answer the door.

25:47.341 --> 25:50.371
Afraid he'd come for her,
I suppose. And I didn't want

25:50.440 --> 25:52.527
to see what was
right in front of my eyes.

25:52.596 --> 25:55.262
I had no sympathy
for her. I complained

25:55.331 --> 25:57.574
when I had to answer
the door for the telegram.

25:58.628 --> 26:00.011
What telegram?

26:00.296 --> 26:02.715
- Who sent it?
- I am trying to help

26:02.784 --> 26:05.739
my daughter in her time of need
and you're badgering me!

26:05.808 --> 26:07.512
I don't know
what the telegram was about!

26:07.581 --> 26:09.482
Who sent it?!

26:11.404 --> 26:14.027
Someone called Nate Desmond.

26:14.261 --> 26:16.995
I'm sure it had nothing
to do with Charlie's death.

26:18.238 --> 26:20.184
How do you know Isabel Lewis?

26:20.441 --> 26:22.152
She's a friend
of Aunt Hattie's.

26:22.308 --> 26:24.255
- My aunt's roof was leaking.
- <i>I knew Hattie</i>

26:24.324 --> 26:27.534
needed help, and I asked Charlie
to fix her roof for her.

26:28.199 --> 26:29.769
He ended up cheating her...

26:29.937 --> 26:31.378
and I felt very badly.

26:31.739 --> 26:34.159
You told me Mr. Lewis
owed you money.

26:34.388 --> 26:36.480
Charlie Lewis owed money
to my aunt.

26:36.777 --> 26:38.870
She told me
how to find Charlie's wife.

26:39.011 --> 26:41.005
Of course I wanted to help,
so I replied

26:41.082 --> 26:43.370
to Mr. Desmond's telegram
to say as much.

26:43.558 --> 26:45.276
That's why you
invited Mr. Lewis

26:45.353 --> 26:47.921
to the Chinese restaurant
that night? To ask him

26:47.998 --> 26:50.964
- to repay Mr. Desmond's aunt?
- Yes.

26:51.425 --> 26:52.808
And it worked.

26:53.574 --> 26:55.215
Charlie wanted
to make it up to me

26:55.284 --> 26:58.659
after our last quarrel.
He wanted me to come home.

26:59.331 --> 27:01.644
He was making
all kinds of promises.

27:02.566 --> 27:03.614
So you see,

27:03.683 --> 27:05.824
Mr. Desmond had no reason
to hurt him, Detective.

27:05.893 --> 27:07.956
I didn't know what came
of their meeting. The police

27:08.025 --> 27:09.722
came for me
before I could find out.

27:09.911 --> 27:12.259
But why would I go after him
if there was still a chance

27:12.328 --> 27:14.050
she could fix it all up?

27:14.691 --> 27:16.300
All right.

27:16.949 --> 27:18.417
Oh...

27:18.824 --> 27:22.550
One other thing.
We found a letter to Isabel

27:22.683 --> 27:25.691
in the fireplace
at Charlie Lewis' apartment.

27:27.003 --> 27:28.714
What do you know about it?

27:30.082 --> 27:32.347
I don't know anything
about any letters.

27:33.339 --> 27:34.567
Why would I?

27:37.269 --> 27:40.064
- That letter could be anything.
- Desmond says

27:40.141 --> 27:42.387
- he didn't know a thing about it.
- Well, I don't

27:42.456 --> 27:44.811
understand why he would,
since he wasn't in the apartment

27:44.888 --> 27:47.972
to begin with, in which case...
he's not lying at all.

27:48.049 --> 27:50.019
I don't disagree
with you, Doctor,

27:50.136 --> 27:52.209
yet my impression
was that Mr. Desmond

27:52.286 --> 27:54.120
cared very much
about that letter.

27:55.105 --> 27:57.130
Do we have a sample
of his handwriting?

27:57.199 --> 27:59.083
Oh, William,
surely you don't think...

27:59.160 --> 28:01.847
I thought of that.
I had him write this out.

28:07.502 --> 28:10.995
- Not exactly a match.
- Well, it's similar.

28:11.254 --> 28:12.878
That's
not conclusive.

28:12.970 --> 28:15.630
Sirs! I've just

28:15.699 --> 28:18.152
spoken to Nate Desmond's aunt.

28:18.449 --> 28:19.536
A very nice woman.

28:19.605 --> 28:22.192
Completely within her faculties,
so far as I can tell.

28:22.261 --> 28:24.722
- Get to the point, Crabtree.
- She said

28:25.480 --> 28:28.488
that she'd never heard
of Charlie or Isabel Lewis.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.514
Nate lied?

28:30.737 --> 28:33.987
- He lied.
- Well, I don't mean

28:34.056 --> 28:36.222
to state the obvious, but it
seems like Nate and Isabel

28:36.316 --> 28:37.922
were having an affair.

28:38.683 --> 28:40.292
I can't believe that of him.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.105
We don't want to believe it,

28:42.214 --> 28:44.526
but the fact is
he lied about everything:

28:44.760 --> 28:46.448
why he fought
with Charlie Lewis,

28:46.516 --> 28:49.956
why he contacted Isabel Lewis.
If the letter is from Nate,

28:50.105 --> 28:52.670
it's possible Mr. Lewis
finds out about the affair.

28:52.747 --> 28:55.292
The two of them fight, she
leaves to stay at her mother's.

28:55.417 --> 28:57.723
The husband threatens to tell
Miss James about the affair.

28:57.792 --> 28:59.712
Of course, that's the last thing
that Nate wants.

28:59.854 --> 29:01.291
Wait.

29:01.360 --> 29:04.381
Mrs. Lewis arranges to meet
her husband somewhere away

29:04.458 --> 29:06.378
from the apartment,
the Chinese restaurant.

29:06.636 --> 29:09.821
She tells Nate. He knows
the apartment will be empty.

29:09.932 --> 29:11.691
He can go in
and destroy the letters.

29:11.877 --> 29:14.102
That also creates opportunity.

29:15.666 --> 29:18.098
Nate wants to protect
Isabel Lewis

29:18.167 --> 29:20.722
from the man who has been
harming her, so he waits...

29:20.917 --> 29:22.628
- and kills him.
- No!

29:22.870 --> 29:24.815
He then burns the letters
to cover up

29:24.925 --> 29:26.503
any connection to the crime.

29:26.580 --> 29:28.548
You said the eyewitness
was wrong.

29:28.792 --> 29:32.109
Well, I proved that he
couldn't be sure who he saw,

29:32.186 --> 29:35.288
but that doesn't mean
he didn't see Nate Desmond.

29:40.987 --> 29:43.921
Mr. Lewis' body is ready
to be released for burial.

29:43.998 --> 29:46.667
I've stitched it up and sent
notification to his family.

29:46.980 --> 29:48.753
I need to check
under the fingernails.

29:48.823 --> 29:50.918
There could be traces
of the killer's skin.

29:50.987 --> 29:52.575
We've done
that already, Doctor.

29:52.644 --> 29:54.317
Well, then, I'll comb
his hair out again.

29:54.386 --> 29:56.253
There may still be
evidence caught in it.

29:56.331 --> 29:59.917
We've done that as well.
We've done everything we can.

30:00.276 --> 30:02.800
Perhaps you should go home and...
Miss Hart.

30:03.260 --> 30:05.206
You're more than welcome
to go home if you like,

30:05.275 --> 30:07.276
but I'm... I'm not done here.

30:11.887 --> 30:13.887
Ahem.

30:14.906 --> 30:16.609
I received your note.

30:17.617 --> 30:19.423
I thought you would
want to know.

30:20.382 --> 30:23.289
I'm sure this isn't
the outcome you were hoping for.

30:23.898 --> 30:25.003
No.

30:25.072 --> 30:27.070
No, indeed, it wasn't.

30:27.874 --> 30:30.140
I'm sorry to send you bad news.

30:30.796 --> 30:32.562
I'm somewhat
of a failure, it seems.

30:32.765 --> 30:35.070
Scientific endeavours
will entail failures.

30:35.203 --> 30:37.307
Setbacks are to be expected.

30:37.453 --> 30:39.518
In this case particularly.

30:39.874 --> 30:42.254
I'm not sure I understand.

30:43.156 --> 30:45.812
Given my complicated
medical history,

30:46.046 --> 30:48.210
you might've
anticipated failure.

30:48.428 --> 30:50.380
It's a wonder you allowed
me to proceed.

30:50.476 --> 30:51.757
Well, you yourself made a

30:51.826 --> 30:54.234
- strong case for being a subject.
- I was entirely biased.

30:54.382 --> 30:55.764
You shouldn't have let me.

30:55.833 --> 30:56.953
This experiment is

30:57.022 --> 30:59.118
- at the forefront...
- Please stop talking

30:59.187 --> 31:00.765
about the experiment!

31:01.578 --> 31:03.578
This was my child!

31:14.070 --> 31:16.021
I have done something wrong.

31:17.093 --> 31:18.321
I do apologize.

31:18.390 --> 31:19.842
Please leave.

31:35.767 --> 31:38.171
If Nate took anything
from Mr. Lewis' apartment

31:38.240 --> 31:40.423
or made note of anything...

31:40.986 --> 31:42.439
There's nothing here, sir.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.501
The lads have been
over it twice.

31:51.744 --> 31:53.361
Just...

31:53.595 --> 31:55.594
♪♪

31:55.671 --> 31:58.666
♪♪♪

32:15.180 --> 32:17.180
Third time's the charm.

32:19.761 --> 32:22.347
If Isabel gave Nate
the key to her apartment,

32:22.604 --> 32:25.128
it's proof that they conspired
to kill her husband.

32:25.323 --> 32:27.347
Nate will surely hang.

32:31.288 --> 32:34.847
He lied.
Sir, it's not your fault.

32:35.089 --> 32:37.776
He came into my home,
asked me to save him,

32:37.893 --> 32:41.253
and he lied to me.
Sir, none of us wanted to...

32:45.104 --> 32:46.737
Well, that's over now.

32:46.939 --> 32:48.807
He'll get what he deserves.

32:49.234 --> 32:51.402
Everybody gets
what they deserve.

32:57.868 --> 33:00.301
It would appear
you were right all along.

33:00.628 --> 33:03.057
I apologize for any disrespect.

33:03.589 --> 33:05.378
Good of you
to own up, Murdoch,

33:05.533 --> 33:08.261
and the additional evidence
will be helpful in court.

33:08.714 --> 33:10.661
Dr. Ogden telephoned Rebecca.

33:10.777 --> 33:12.573
She's coming from Chatham.

33:15.097 --> 33:16.878
I didn't kill anyone.

33:17.218 --> 33:19.284
You did
the right thing, Murdoch.

33:27.461 --> 33:29.089
Julia!

33:30.620 --> 33:32.057
Rebecca.

33:33.214 --> 33:34.618
I'm sorry to see you again

33:34.695 --> 33:36.628
under these circumstances,
Dr. James.

33:36.737 --> 33:38.636
It's Dr. Desmond now,
Inspector.

33:38.761 --> 33:41.224
And I must admit, I'm having
trouble understanding

33:41.293 --> 33:43.198
what exactly
the circumstances are.

33:43.361 --> 33:45.940
- A man has been killed.
- And Nate

33:46.073 --> 33:48.003
- is accused of his murder?
- We suspect

33:48.072 --> 33:50.534
he was involved in a... conflict

33:50.940 --> 33:52.936
with the husband
of a woman he knows.

33:53.013 --> 33:55.722
You think Nate was having
an affair with this woman?

33:56.409 --> 33:59.254
- I can promise you you're wrong.
- We did try

33:59.323 --> 34:01.387
to prove otherwise.
Your best hope now

34:01.464 --> 34:03.386
is to get yourself
a good lawyer.

34:03.958 --> 34:06.637
- I want to talk to Nate.
- Of course.

34:06.706 --> 34:08.226
I'll take you to him.

34:12.866 --> 34:15.717
It's been a long day.
You should get some rest.

34:16.257 --> 34:17.492
She seemed quite sure

34:17.561 --> 34:19.123
that Nate wasn't unfaithful.

34:19.193 --> 34:22.538
She likely wanted to hear it from
him rather than take our word.

34:23.143 --> 34:26.311
If she is right,
where does that leave us?

34:26.585 --> 34:27.875
What other reason could he

34:27.944 --> 34:29.482
and Mrs. Lewis have
for colluding?

34:29.858 --> 34:33.264
Something they feel
they can't tell us.

34:34.833 --> 34:37.268
Isabel Lewis knows the truth.

34:42.563 --> 34:44.822
I wasn't having an affair
with Mr. Desmond.

34:44.891 --> 34:47.030
But we know that you were
colluding, Mrs. Lewis.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.772
What was the reason?

34:49.402 --> 34:51.780
If Mr. Desmond hasn't
told you himself, then I...

34:51.927 --> 34:53.889
He will hang for this!

34:54.473 --> 34:56.438
What could you
possibly have to say

34:56.507 --> 34:58.491
that would make it any worse?

34:58.741 --> 35:01.180
I have nothing to say
that can help him.

35:07.847 --> 35:10.819
Do you know what you
and Mr. Desmond have done?

35:13.660 --> 35:15.725
My wife has lost...

35:20.076 --> 35:22.110
She is out of her sickbed

35:22.312 --> 35:25.155
at work trying to help him.

35:25.835 --> 35:27.382
I should be with her.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.319
We should...

35:31.979 --> 35:34.546
I need for all of this
to make sense,

35:35.053 --> 35:37.108
and none of it makes any sense.

35:39.100 --> 35:40.649
And you sit here and say

35:40.718 --> 35:44.343
that you can't tell me
what is going on?

35:47.562 --> 35:49.968
His wife is my doctor.

35:55.053 --> 35:56.344
The handwriting in that letter

35:56.413 --> 35:58.374
was similar to Nate's because...

35:58.741 --> 36:00.372
you taught him to write.

36:00.569 --> 36:02.163
Yes.

36:02.772 --> 36:05.232
The letter to Isabel
was from you.

36:07.181 --> 36:09.061
Yes, it was.

36:12.720 --> 36:15.045
Rebecca Desmond is
your doctor?

36:15.475 --> 36:17.382
There's nothing wrong with that.

36:17.577 --> 36:19.186
You could have told us
that before.

36:19.255 --> 36:20.897
No.

36:21.710 --> 36:23.811
No one else was
supposed to know.

36:24.350 --> 36:25.703
Only me,

36:25.780 --> 36:28.867
Dr. Desmond and the doctor
who helped her.

36:29.593 --> 36:31.795
It was a secret
between us three.

36:32.288 --> 36:34.131
But then Charlie found
her letters,

36:34.208 --> 36:35.796
and he was so sad about it.

36:35.865 --> 36:39.061
And the only way he knew how
to be sad was with his fists.

36:40.568 --> 36:43.983
Don't you see? I absolutely
couldn't tell the police.

36:47.046 --> 36:49.579
I gave Mr. Desmond the key,
but he was only supposed

36:49.656 --> 36:51.423
to get rid of the letters.
I never thought

36:51.500 --> 36:52.827
he would hurt Charlie.

37:01.035 --> 37:03.624
You provided that woman
with an abortion?

37:05.521 --> 37:06.865
Yes, I did.

37:06.936 --> 37:08.671
How did you know what to do?

37:08.952 --> 37:11.233
I consulted the textbooks.

37:16.250 --> 37:18.405
Is this what you do now?

37:18.587 --> 37:21.421
That was the first time.
Mrs. Lewis came to me

37:21.522 --> 37:23.781
looking for help. She was in
an untenable situation.

37:23.850 --> 37:25.843
Then her husband found out
about the procedure.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.655
That's what started this mess!

37:27.749 --> 37:30.272
When he found out, he tried
to blackmail Rebecca.

37:30.413 --> 37:32.633
Yes. He could have
gone to the police.

37:32.702 --> 37:34.460
Indeed, I could
arrest you right now.

37:34.561 --> 37:36.772
- William, no!
- What happened next?

37:36.850 --> 37:38.343
We didn't have the money he wanted.

37:38.412 --> 37:40.421
We wouldn't have given it
to him anyway if we did.

37:40.490 --> 37:42.290
Rebecca would have
lost her medical license.

37:42.359 --> 37:45.202
She could've gone to jail!
I had to protect my wife.

37:45.358 --> 37:48.327
- So you killed him?
- I came to talk sense to him.

37:48.436 --> 37:50.788
Then he told me about
the letters. Having the proof,

37:50.857 --> 37:52.671
I knew he wasn't
gonna back down.

37:52.740 --> 37:55.663
So you went to Isabel
for help? She gave you the key,

37:55.732 --> 37:57.538
and got him out
of the apartment for you.

37:57.700 --> 37:59.811
I went in.
I burned the letters.

37:59.904 --> 38:01.859
When I heard Charlie
at the door, I ran out

38:01.928 --> 38:03.484
the back window and down
the back stairs.

38:03.546 --> 38:05.952
You fought with Mr. Lewis,
then you ran out.

38:06.021 --> 38:07.632
- A witness heard you.
- It didn't happen

38:07.701 --> 38:09.663
- that way, Detective.
- I know you have no reason

38:09.732 --> 38:13.069
to believe me. I am sorry
I lied to you before,

38:13.514 --> 38:15.149
but now that you know
about the abortion,

38:15.218 --> 38:17.975
I can tell you the truth.
Once those letters were burned,

38:18.053 --> 38:20.746
I'd done what I came to do.
I got the heck out of there.

May we come in?

38:55.797 --> 38:58.587
There was no altercation
before Nate Desmond

38:58.656 --> 39:00.305
ran down the back stairs.

39:00.828 --> 39:03.070
The murder occurred
after he left,

39:03.351 --> 39:07.015
and you would have
a good reason to lie about that.

39:07.719 --> 39:09.695
Because the fight was with you.

39:10.305 --> 39:12.422
No... it wasn't...

39:12.898 --> 39:14.558
I heard them.

39:15.180 --> 39:16.539
I heard a man.

39:16.827 --> 39:18.515
These apartments
are furnished,

39:18.584 --> 39:20.390
aren't they, Mr. Lough?

39:21.187 --> 39:23.145
Which means that you have

39:23.215 --> 39:25.406
the exact same fire poker

39:25.546 --> 39:27.156
that Mr. Lewis had.

39:28.133 --> 39:31.305
And when you saw Nate run off,
you realized your opportunity.

39:31.375 --> 39:33.680
That's... that's not...
I wouldn't.

39:33.836 --> 39:35.320
When we examine this,

39:35.389 --> 39:37.865
we will find
human blood on it, and...

39:38.831 --> 39:41.631
hair, it would appear.

39:47.701 --> 39:49.248
I love Isabel.

39:50.582 --> 39:52.599
I couldn't stand it...

39:54.193 --> 39:56.279
sitting around like a coward

39:56.928 --> 39:58.602
while he hit her,

39:58.771 --> 40:00.613
and I did nothing.

40:01.178 --> 40:03.271

40:38.493 --> 40:41.053
Is there something you'd
like to tell me, Julia?

40:43.021 --> 40:45.982
You sound as if you believe
you already know.

40:47.707 --> 40:51.420
You advised Rebecca to give
Isabel Lewis an abortion.

40:51.872 --> 40:53.420
I did not.

40:54.623 --> 40:56.357
Rebecca consulted with you

40:56.467 --> 40:59.224
and provided
the procedure. Correct?

William, I...

vital information from me.

That's not true.

41:13.886 --> 41:16.154
I didn't know
who the patient was.

41:16.240 --> 41:19.146
I only made the connection today
when I saw Rebecca.

41:19.232 --> 41:23.560
- And you didn't tell me.
- It was a matter of privilege.

41:24.428 --> 41:26.240
Rebecca is your student,

41:26.428 --> 41:29.389
not a patient.
There is no privilege.

41:31.490 --> 41:34.170
You're right.
I was protecting her.

41:34.241 --> 41:35.794
Because you thought
I would arrest her.

41:35.863 --> 41:39.413
- I'm afraid you still might!
- It is a crime, Julia!

41:39.566 --> 41:41.288
Well, it's a stupid law,
William!

41:41.357 --> 41:44.896
It is a moral law!
One you advised her to break.

41:44.965 --> 41:47.154
I did not tell her
to perform an abortion.

41:47.266 --> 41:49.428
I told her to follow
her own conscience!

41:49.545 --> 41:51.810
And I would tell her to do
the same 100 times over!

41:51.912 --> 41:54.426
Meaning you have no moral
misgivings on the subject.

41:54.592 --> 41:56.990
That's right!
That's exactly what I told her.

41:57.131 --> 41:59.568
You told her that
there is nothing amoral

41:59.646 --> 42:01.553
about ending
an innocent child's life?

42:01.724 --> 42:04.070
That it doesn't matter
if it lives or dies?

42:04.139 --> 42:07.349
That it isn't a child
if it isn't born yet?

42:11.303 --> 42:12.693
William...

42:13.771 --> 42:16.982
This isn't about the case.
This is about our child.
