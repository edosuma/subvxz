WEBVTT

00:06.685 --> 00:09.017
- Hey, good morning, G.
- Good morning, Master William.

00:09.087 --> 00:11.578
So, ready for the big camping expedition?

00:12.391 --> 00:14.222
Please, man, I'm from Philly.

00:14.293 --> 00:18.229
To me, a wilderness experience
is dating a girl who don't shave her legs.

00:19.498 --> 00:23.730
My uncle Reggie always insisted
the woods were safer than the cities.

00:24.036 --> 00:27.267
- Until the day he died.
- Word? Y o, how'd he die?

00:27.339 --> 00:28.966
He was eaten by wolves.

00:35.147 --> 00:36.546
Carlton's log.

00:36.615 --> 00:38.947
<i>E</i> arth date: 1992.

00:39.918 --> 00:41.317
It's 6:00 a.m.

00:41.386 --> 00:46.016
Up with the dawn, the small band of brave
souls prepare to pile into their Mercedes.

00:46.992 --> 00:49.722
Destination: Adventure.

00:52.431 --> 00:54.956
Carlton, you look like Webster on a safari.

00:56.535 --> 00:59.527
Hi, guys.
I'm doing the morning weather today.

00:59.605 --> 01:01.004
Oh, goody.

01:03.976 --> 01:06.945
And after that, you're off to join
Miss Ashley and Mrs. Banks...

01:07.012 --> 01:09.708
at the spa
for their beauty makeover weekend?

01:09.781 --> 01:13.182
Beauty makeover? With this face?
I don't think so.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.955
Good morning, everyone.

01:18.023 --> 01:21.982
Y ou know, men,
I'm really looking forward to this.

01:22.060 --> 01:24.187
Reminds me of camping with my father.

01:24.262 --> 01:27.288
Sleeping under the stars,
climbing mountains...

01:27.366 --> 01:30.767
braving winds that could knock
a grown man flat to the ground.

01:34.506 --> 01:36.701
Hey, man, I ain't trying to be nowhere
around a wind...

01:36.775 --> 01:39.266
that can knock Uncle Phil to the ground.

01:40.979 --> 01:43.447
Well, I hope you prepared for rain.

01:43.515 --> 01:47.042
I'm predicting a 90o/o chance
of precipitation.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.447
And you know how often I'm right.

01:51.523 --> 01:52.615
Bye.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.391
- Let's unpack the rain gear.
- Y eah.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074

03:12.137 --> 03:14.970
Uncle Phil,
I got a bad feeling about this one.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.133
I mean, I think we should just turn back.

03:17.209 --> 03:19.609
Will, you said that
before we got in the car...

03:19.678 --> 03:21.009
when we pulled out of the driveway...

03:21.079 --> 03:22.410
when we pulled onto the freeway...

03:22.481 --> 03:25.041
- when we pulled off the freeway.
- Then do it!

03:26.852 --> 03:30.151
Come on, Uncle Phil, it's dark,
it's raining, and we're lost.

03:30.222 --> 03:33.453
- We are not lost.
- Will, ye of little faith.

03:33.525 --> 03:35.459
- Dad knows exactly what he's doing.
- That's right.

03:35.527 --> 03:39.827
Do you think anyone would drive by
the same tree seven times on purpose?

03:46.338 --> 03:47.703
Carlton's log.

03:48.673 --> 03:50.664
We're somewhere in the galaxy.

03:51.143 --> 03:53.407
My father has no idea where.

03:55.480 --> 03:59.007
Uncle Phil, I'm telling you, I think
we should just pull into a gas station.

03:59.084 --> 04:02.485
Will, for the last time,
I don't need directions.

04:07.826 --> 04:10.021
Y ou're right. Y ou need gas.

04:12.430 --> 04:14.227
Okay, I made a wrong turn.

04:14.299 --> 04:16.995
It's no big deal,
it's not the end of the world. We'll just...

04:17.067 --> 04:18.865
We'll thumb a ride
to the nearest gas station.

04:18.937 --> 04:21.064
We used to do it a lot in the '60s.

04:21.505 --> 04:24.566
Uncle Phil, can you take a stroll
into the '90s, please?

04:25.677 --> 04:29.511
We are three black men
on the side of a mountain road.

04:29.581 --> 04:31.208
The only people that's going to stop...

04:31.283 --> 04:34.810
is going to have on sheets
and saying stuff like, "Get them, Jim Bob."

04:35.787 --> 04:37.550
Will may have a point, Dad.

04:37.622 --> 04:40.455
Why don't we stay here
and let him go get the gas?

04:41.493 --> 04:43.222
We're all getting out of the car.

04:43.295 --> 04:46.389
We can make camp right here
and go for gas in the morning.

04:46.464 --> 04:49.865
Let's get out of the car. Get out of the car.

04:51.736 --> 04:54.500
Oh, my God, look!
Where's our camping equipment?

04:54.573 --> 04:58.065
Will, you were supposed to secure
everything to the luggage rack.

04:58.143 --> 04:59.337
I did.

05:00.412 --> 05:02.471
Wait, this ain't the Volvo.

05:06.852 --> 05:09.047
The car phone, we'll call for road service.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.451
Y eah, great idea, Carlton.

05:10.522 --> 05:12.513
Y ou can tell them
exactly where we are, too.

05:12.591 --> 05:15.321
Somewhere in the dark
between a rock and a tree.

05:16.428 --> 05:20.387
<i>/'m sorry, you are outside the ca//ing area.</i>
<i>P/ease try your ca// again.</i>

05:22.033 --> 05:24.331
Well, I guess sending for pizza's out.

05:24.636 --> 05:26.194
All right, now, that's it, that's enough.

05:26.271 --> 05:28.739
We'll just get back in the car
and go for gas in the morning.

05:28.807 --> 05:29.865
Now get in the car.

05:29.941 --> 05:31.932
- But you just...
- Get in the car!

05:52.097 --> 05:56.659
Y ou know, Uncle Phil, now, I haven't been
on too many camping trips...

05:57.402 --> 05:59.666
but snow is a bad thing, right?

06:00.138 --> 06:04.507
Look. Let's look on the bright side, okay?
This will give us a perfect opportunity to...

06:04.576 --> 06:06.567
pull together
and show what we're made of.

06:06.978 --> 06:09.412
Does Bigfoot have to come down here
with a chain saw...

06:09.481 --> 06:11.346
before you admit we're in trouble?

06:11.416 --> 06:13.976
Okay, we can't stay here,
we'll freeze to death.

06:14.052 --> 06:18.113
Just get all the stuff out of the back seat.
We'll go ahead on foot. Get out of the car.

06:18.189 --> 06:20.657
- But you just...
- Get out of the damn car!

06:25.563 --> 06:27.258
Y ou know, Miss Hilary...

06:27.532 --> 06:30.023
I've never seen this side of you before.

06:30.969 --> 06:34.632
Baggy clothes, no makeup, tousled hair.

06:35.507 --> 06:38.635
Y ou know, I feel really comfortable
like this, too, Geoffrey.

06:38.710 --> 06:40.803
I mean,
I don't need to hide behind cosmetics.

06:40.879 --> 06:42.972
I'm beautiful just the way I am.

06:45.617 --> 06:46.879
Hilary, you home?

06:46.952 --> 06:50.012
Oh, my God. It's Trevor.
Quick, get my hot comb.

06:50.088 --> 06:53.182
Sorry, this is the scene
where Barbara finds out...

06:53.258 --> 06:56.386
Robert's been cheating
with a button-nosed bimbo.

07:03.601 --> 07:05.262
For you, pretty mama.

07:06.037 --> 07:09.370
Trevor, he's adorable.

07:09.441 --> 07:12.410
- Goodbye.
- Wait a second.

07:12.477 --> 07:15.537
I also brought you these.

07:16.948 --> 07:18.973
Trevor, they're beautiful.

07:19.050 --> 07:21.610
They look just like the flowers
down at the newsroom.

07:21.853 --> 07:24.344
Just be sure to have them back
before 10:00.

07:26.257 --> 07:28.020
My florist is on vacation.

07:29.327 --> 07:32.660
Oh, my. Y ou look beautiful.

07:35.033 --> 07:38.264
Here. Why don't you put this on ice?

07:39.170 --> 07:41.263
- Champagne?
- Y eah.

07:41.339 --> 07:43.398
What are we celebrating?

07:44.776 --> 07:46.437
An empty house.

07:46.511 --> 07:47.500
Y oo-hoo!

07:50.982 --> 07:53.746
I thought this was your day off.

07:53.818 --> 07:57.117
Correct, but you overlooked one fact.

07:57.822 --> 07:59.517
I have no life.

08:05.397 --> 08:10.027
- Geoffrey, will you get it?
- On my day off? Y ou'd really let me?

08:14.005 --> 08:17.202
Well, I thought we'd have
a quiet evening together...

08:17.275 --> 08:20.108
and I'd make you dinner.

08:20.812 --> 08:23.110
Trevor, that is so sweet.

08:23.715 --> 08:27.651
All right, now. Y ou get out of the kitchen.
I want this to be a surprise.

08:31.589 --> 08:33.489
Surprise!

08:43.034 --> 08:45.195
Jazz, what do you think you're doing?

08:45.270 --> 08:49.730
Looking after you, my pet. After all,
you're a beautiful, desirable woman.

08:51.142 --> 08:53.975
Or you would be
if you combed your hair once in a while.

08:54.045 --> 08:56.570
And some lipstick wouldn't kill you, either.

08:57.315 --> 08:59.442
Look, Jazz, go home.

09:03.755 --> 09:06.223
Stand back. Let a man handle this.

09:06.291 --> 09:08.191
No. Jazz.

09:09.994 --> 09:13.327
- What are you doing here?
- I'm cooking dinner.

09:14.399 --> 09:17.061
Good, I like my steak medium-rare.

09:17.368 --> 09:20.428
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to freshen up a bit.

09:21.706 --> 09:23.298
Get off me!

09:27.412 --> 09:29.346
Would you...

09:30.648 --> 09:32.775
See, a cave.

09:32.851 --> 09:35.012
Told you everything would be all right.

09:43.962 --> 09:46.692
I'm sorry.
I was trying to scare the bears away.

09:47.232 --> 09:48.494
Carlton's log.

09:50.068 --> 09:51.365
I'm wet.

09:52.403 --> 09:54.394
I'm wet and I'm cold.

09:55.106 --> 09:58.269
I'm wet and I'm cold and I'm in a cave.

09:58.877 --> 10:00.367
Shut up, Carlton.

10:02.113 --> 10:03.512
I'm shutting up.

10:05.016 --> 10:06.540
I'm shutting up and I'm wet.

10:06.618 --> 10:08.142
- That's it!
- Hey.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.044
Just relax!

10:10.121 --> 10:11.850
Look, come on.

10:12.590 --> 10:14.922
Now, we'll build a fire.

10:15.727 --> 10:17.888
How are we supposed to build a fire,
Uncle Phil?

10:17.962 --> 10:20.795
It's snowing outside.
All the wood is soaking wet.

10:20.865 --> 10:22.833
Then we'll freeze to death.

10:22.901 --> 10:24.562
I don't want to die.

10:24.636 --> 10:28.595
I want to go to college and poke fun
at all the kids on financial aid.

10:29.140 --> 10:31.438
I want to see <i>Karate Kid 17.</i>

10:31.776 --> 10:32.936
Carlton.

10:34.646 --> 10:36.045
Don't panic.

10:38.383 --> 10:41.113
Will, you check the cave for dry wood.

10:41.186 --> 10:43.814
Man, I ain't walking around in this cave
by myself.

10:43.888 --> 10:47.380
There's rats and bats and bears and stuff
all over the place.

10:47.458 --> 10:48.857
Me, neither, Dad.

10:48.927 --> 10:52.988
I think the three of us should just
cuddle up close together for the night.

10:53.898 --> 10:56.458
I'm going to go check the cave
for some wood.

10:58.736 --> 11:02.763
- I found this bag, Uncle Phil.
- Will, we can't just burn a bag.

11:03.908 --> 11:07.400
We're helpless, it's over, we're dead.

11:07.845 --> 11:09.836
- We're rich!
- What?

11:09.914 --> 11:11.677
Hey, back up, back up!

11:17.722 --> 11:19.883
960, 980...

11:20.391 --> 11:23.417
$25,000.

11:26.631 --> 11:30.397
Do you all mind if I get butt naked
and roll around in this for a little while?

11:31.102 --> 11:34.560
Will, we're going to have to turn
that money over to the authorities.

11:34.639 --> 11:38.973
If nobody claims it, then you can keep it,
but until then, I think I should look after it.

11:39.043 --> 11:40.305
Whoa, no!

11:40.979 --> 11:42.173
I'm all right, Uncle Phil.

11:42.247 --> 11:46.581
I'll just find a safe place to keep it,
you know, just for the night.

11:57.262 --> 11:58.559
Goodnight, Abe.

12:00.131 --> 12:01.928
Goodnight, Alexander.

12:02.033 --> 12:04.297
And I can't forget you, Ben.

12:04.969 --> 12:07.767
Man, I'm sleeping with the presidents.

12:08.873 --> 12:11.171
Must be what Marilyn Monroe felt like.

12:40.071 --> 12:41.595
What's for dinner?

12:42.407 --> 12:45.171
Jazz, I told you to go home.

12:49.314 --> 12:52.044
How fast were you going
when you hit this?

12:53.084 --> 12:56.110
Now, see here, homey.

12:58.923 --> 13:02.723
My lady and I are trying to have
an intimate moment.

13:03.761 --> 13:07.356
Oh, I get it.
Y ou're trying to make me jealous.

13:08.066 --> 13:10.626
Well, it worked like a charm.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.329
Beat it, buddy.

13:13.004 --> 13:15.097
How dare you talk to me like that?

13:15.173 --> 13:17.835
Do you have any idea who I am?

13:18.676 --> 13:20.166
A really bad cook?

13:21.179 --> 13:25.275
Trevor, could you excuse us
for a moment, please?

13:25.817 --> 13:28.718
I have never been so insulted in my life.

13:28.786 --> 13:30.947
Blind people recognize me.

13:32.857 --> 13:36.657
- I could kill you.
- Okay, baby, hurt me.

13:39.230 --> 13:42.097
Look, I am not going to let you
screw this up for me.

13:42.166 --> 13:45.135
Trevor is a wonderful man.

13:45.603 --> 13:49.437
But I'm Jazz, the lover of all lovers.

13:52.143 --> 13:54.202
I put the "afro" in aphrodisiac.

13:55.980 --> 13:59.609
So lose the stiff,
and I'll be waiting in the pool house.

14:01.352 --> 14:03.411
And fix yourself up a little.

14:12.330 --> 14:15.231
What happened to your friend?

14:16.234 --> 14:19.294
Don't worry about him.
What are you watching?

14:19.637 --> 14:23.505
One of those silly sentimental films,
formula stuff.

14:24.275 --> 14:26.072
Can I watch with you?

14:27.011 --> 14:28.000
Sure.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.446
But I have to go home in a few minutes.

15:10.755 --> 15:12.552
I don't want to alarm either one of you...

15:12.623 --> 15:16.491
but it's about 20 degrees in here,
and it's only going to get worse.

15:18.896 --> 15:20.124
Carlton's log.

15:21.532 --> 15:22.726
I hate Dad.

15:27.638 --> 15:30.334
Y ou know,
this wood is just too wet to ignite.

15:30.408 --> 15:32.467
We need something dry.

15:32.543 --> 15:35.239
I'm afraid it's going to have to be
something that's...

15:35.313 --> 15:37.110
near and dear to all of us.

15:38.115 --> 15:40.948
Come on, Uncle Phil,
at least knock him out first.

15:41.819 --> 15:43.946
I'm talking about the money, Will.

15:46.424 --> 15:47.652
Will.

15:47.758 --> 15:50.488
Do you want to die
with $25,000 by your side...

15:50.561 --> 15:52.927
or do you want to live to see tomorrow?

15:57.101 --> 15:59.069
I'm thinking, I'm thinking, all right?

15:59.136 --> 16:02.037
- I'm afraid there's no other choice.
- All right.

16:03.574 --> 16:06.702
Look, can I just have
a few minutes alone with the guys?

16:08.012 --> 16:09.001
Okay.

16:18.122 --> 16:19.111
Dad.

16:19.590 --> 16:22.150
When you throw that money into the fire...

16:22.226 --> 16:24.694
if I lose my head and leap in after it...

16:24.762 --> 16:26.491
you'll pull me out, right?

16:29.433 --> 16:33.062
Son, there are more important things
in life than money.

16:34.138 --> 16:37.403
Y eah, but I can't get a date, either.

16:50.054 --> 16:51.851
All right, here's the money.

17:05.736 --> 17:06.862
What?

17:22.153 --> 17:26.112
- Was that Andrew or Ben?
- It was Ben.

17:28.224 --> 17:32.321
I'm sorry, Ben. Y ou was one of the few
white people I could really count on.

17:33.598 --> 17:35.088
Carlton's log.

17:36.167 --> 17:39.534
Will has been reduced to a pathetic shell
of his former self.

17:40.771 --> 17:43.638
I, on the other hand,
have the strength of 10 men.

17:45.209 --> 17:49.703
Will's log is about to connect
with Carlton's head!

17:49.780 --> 17:51.543
Hey.

17:51.949 --> 17:54.110
Hey, Will, give me the log.

17:55.987 --> 17:58.478
That's not why I brought you two up here.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.587
I really blew it.

18:05.529 --> 18:09.863
All I wanted to do was spend some time
with you before you went off to college.

18:11.335 --> 18:14.930
Y ou know, there was a better way
of doing it, Uncle Phil.

18:15.006 --> 18:17.998
Perhaps a matinee and a box of Raisinets.

18:19.977 --> 18:23.105
Raisinets? I hate Raisinets.

18:23.180 --> 18:25.011
Can we get some Goobers?

18:27.485 --> 18:29.180
It's not the same.

18:30.855 --> 18:34.814
Some of the best memories of my life
are camping with my father.

18:36.560 --> 18:40.121
He taught me how to hunt and fish,
how to pitch a tent.

18:41.799 --> 18:44.825
I'm guessing he didn't teach you
how to use a compass.

18:54.145 --> 18:56.045
Now that he's gone...

18:57.515 --> 18:58.982
I really miss him.

19:01.752 --> 19:04.220
I really appreciate what we had together.

19:06.557 --> 19:08.184
He was quite a man.

19:09.827 --> 19:12.193
I learned so much from him.

19:14.999 --> 19:16.933
That's decent, Uncle Phil.

19:17.001 --> 19:19.993
At least you had somebody
to teach you stuff, you know?

19:20.071 --> 19:22.096
I had to learn everything on my own.

19:22.173 --> 19:25.233
I mean, my mom was working
all the time and everything.

19:25.876 --> 19:28.367
Like, I wanted to roller skate...

19:28.446 --> 19:30.539
but, you know,
I didn't even really know how to do it.

19:30.614 --> 19:33.640
So I used to put on one skate
and push with the other foot.

19:36.187 --> 19:40.521
Never seemed like I could be fast enough
to keep up with the other kids, though.

19:41.325 --> 19:44.590
Y ou know, actually that's how I felt
when I came to Bel-Air, you know?

19:44.662 --> 19:49.065
It's like everybody had two skates,
and I was trying to keep up with one.

19:54.338 --> 19:56.636
Thanks for my other skate, Uncle Phil.

20:02.513 --> 20:05.107
For a long time it gave me nightmares...

20:06.717 --> 20:09.447
having to witness an injustice like that.

20:11.655 --> 20:15.523
It was a constant reminder
of how unfair this world can be.

20:17.995 --> 20:20.361
I can still hear them taunting him:

20:22.767 --> 20:25.292
"Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids."

20:36.580 --> 20:39.378
How come they just couldn't give him
some cereal?

20:47.691 --> 20:51.457
- Y ou guys, wake up. Wake up.
- Whoa, man.

20:54.965 --> 20:58.731
We made it. We made it.
Uncle Phil, wake up.

20:58.803 --> 21:00.930
Vivian, I'm not a machine!

21:08.746 --> 21:10.976
Come on, Dad, it's morning.

21:11.048 --> 21:12.743
What do you know, it stopped snowing.

21:12.817 --> 21:16.082
Come on, let's get the hell out of here
and find a Denny's.

21:17.721 --> 21:20.315
Uncle Phil, if I ever agree
to go camping with you all...

21:20.391 --> 21:23.656
just hold my head underwater
till I stop struggling.

21:30.401 --> 21:32.369
- Here we go now.
- Congratulations.

21:32.436 --> 21:35.166
- What's up?
- Right this way, guys, right this way.

21:35.239 --> 21:37.605
Come right over here. Right over here.

21:38.275 --> 21:41.472
Hey, guys, listen.
I'm <i>E</i> d Barker from station KCB <i>E</i>.

21:41.545 --> 21:44.878
- Congratulations, guys. Y ou did it.
- We did?

21:44.949 --> 21:48.441
- That's right. Now what are your names?
- Well, I'm innocent Will.

21:48.519 --> 21:52.751
And this is Uncle Phil, attorney at law,
and this is little Carlton.

21:52.857 --> 21:55.553
He's trying to find his way back
to the circus.

21:56.060 --> 21:58.358
- What did we do?
- And was it legal?

21:58.429 --> 22:01.125
Homey, we was going to give
the money back, man, but my uncle...

22:01.198 --> 22:03.723
Give it back? It's yours to keep.

22:05.302 --> 22:08.897
See, you just found the last clue
in the KCB <i>E</i> scavenger hunt.

22:08.973 --> 22:10.702
Y ou found the prize money.

22:13.978 --> 22:18.005
Well, now tell me something, guys.
How does it feel to be rich?

22:19.884 --> 22:22.375
Terrible. Uncle <i>Backdraft</i> made us burn it.

22:24.255 --> 22:28.385
- Y ou burned $50,000?
- $50,000?

22:29.660 --> 22:31.560
Y ou said it was $25,000.

22:34.231 --> 22:37.564
I must have miscounted. Oh, well.

22:48.479 --> 22:52.142
Taught me how to hunt, how to fish,
how to pinch a tent...

22:54.418 --> 22:57.046
y ou know, you pinch...
y ou got to pinch it right down there.

23:00.024 --> 23:03.050
Y ou know,
right by the pole where they put in the...

23:03.127 --> 23:05.391
Let's sketch it.

23:05.729 --> 23:07.492
How to pinch a tent?

23:07.564 --> 23:09.964
<i>Come here, you cute /itt/e tent.</i>
<i>/'m gonna pinch you.</i>

23:10.034 --> 23:11.797
<i>You is a cute /itt/e tent.</i>
