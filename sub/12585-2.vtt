WEBVTT

00:33.366 --> 00:34.534
Shh, here she comes.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.209
Surprise!

00:46.087 --> 00:48.089
Eh, we get her every year.

00:52.552 --> 00:56.222
This is the one day a year
my dad disappoints me.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.266
Feeling a little left out, are ya, Bobby?

00:58.850 --> 00:59.809
Well, you shouldn't.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.020
I got something in the truck just for you.

01:05.857 --> 01:08.359
You like your birthday bone,
don't you, girl?

01:08.443 --> 01:09.861
Look, everybody!

01:09.944 --> 01:13.281


01:13.740 --> 01:15.450
What the hell is that?

01:15.533 --> 01:17.786
It's my new pet, Josh!

01:17.869 --> 01:19.537
Lucky gave it to me.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.873
He's gonna be such a great father.

01:21.956 --> 01:23.708
Get that snake off you this instant!

01:23.792 --> 01:26.252
I will not sit by
and watch you be strangled

01:26.336 --> 01:27.545
in my very own home!

01:27.629 --> 01:30.131
Lucky, you're taking that dang thing back.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.299
I don't know, Hank.

01:31.382 --> 01:33.176
Snakes make pretty cool pets.

01:33.259 --> 01:36.387
They don't have legs,
so they can't run away from you.

01:36.471 --> 01:37.972
And no matter how hard you cuddle it,

01:38.056 --> 01:39.265
you can't break it.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.893
No! Snakes are awful pets.

01:41.976 --> 01:44.229
It's like a breathing stick,

01:44.312 --> 01:47.190
staring at you all weird. Now put it down.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.775
Okay.

01:49.609 --> 01:52.278
It's coming to kill me!

01:52.362 --> 01:54.364
It knows I'm a Christian!

01:58.451 --> 02:01.079
Whoa, I ain't never
seen it do that before.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.789
It's agitated.

02:08.545 --> 02:10.130
Somebody go get Dale.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.677
If I leave,
you guys will let me back in, right?

02:17.345 --> 02:18.304


02:19.139 --> 02:22.142
People should just have dogs.

02:34.779 --> 02:36.531
Well, Dale, what do you think?

02:36.614 --> 02:38.199
You think you might want to grab it?

02:38.283 --> 02:40.410
This is going to take time, Hank.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.995
I'm trying to break its spirit,

02:42.078 --> 02:45.874
but it's an Alpha snake
whilst I am clearly a Beta snake.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.338
Clever opening gambit.

02:52.422 --> 02:53.840
Game on.

02:57.218 --> 02:59.345
Ha!

03:00.680 --> 03:02.724
Welp, it's in the toilet. Too late.

03:02.807 --> 03:04.642
No, it's not. Quick, grab it.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.103
Sorry, Hank. I'm a private contractor.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.855
This is now a public matter.

03:08.938 --> 03:11.983
Once that snake's head
crosses the rim threshold

03:12.066 --> 03:13.526
it's the county's problem.

03:15.069 --> 03:17.989
County's problem? Come on. Do something.

03:18.072 --> 03:18.907
Not to worry.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.576
The County Animal Control guys
are the best.

03:21.659 --> 03:25.330
I have personally seen Tommy and Rollo
kill a gopher with a pigeon.

03:28.583 --> 03:32.712
The species is a Burmese Python,
around six feet long.

03:32.795 --> 03:36.174
It escaped down the toilet at 11:46.

03:36.257 --> 03:37.842
So what do you want us to do about it?

03:37.926 --> 03:39.844
Uh, I'd like you to catch it.

03:45.099 --> 03:47.060
Little League field's clean.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.648
They don't pay us enough for this.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.109
And this yahoo wants us
to catch his pet snake.

03:55.193 --> 03:56.444
It's not my pet,

03:56.527 --> 03:57.946
but it is your job.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.531
Yeah, well, we don't get
paid the kind of money

04:00.615 --> 04:02.116
the cops and firemen do.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.368
Not even close.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.578
But when City Hall's run over by possums

04:05.662 --> 04:07.830
they don't make them disappear. We do.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.457
Yeah, you think it's just magic.

04:09.540 --> 04:10.917
Well, it's the kind of magic you do

04:11.000 --> 04:13.336
with a ball-peen hammer
in a deserted place.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.546
This is the magic I believe in.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.591
I pay my taxes and you find that snake.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.760
People hate them and if they find out

04:20.843 --> 04:23.012
that a six-foot one is loose in the sewer,

04:23.096 --> 04:24.264
it could cause a panic.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.599
Panic? Hmm.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.184
Maybe this could cause a panic.

04:28.935 --> 04:29.811
Mr. Hill,

04:29.894 --> 04:32.480
I am putting this matter
to the top of our agenda.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.607
Here's a form that will expedite things.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.943
Ah, finally. Paperwork.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.611
Now we're getting somewhere.

04:41.489 --> 04:42.615
That guy's serious.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.242
We might have to do something.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.035
We are gonna do something.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.120
Nothing.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.206
The longer that snake is out there,

04:50.290 --> 04:53.209
the more the town panics,
the more valuable we become.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.462
That snake is our ticket

04:56.546 --> 04:58.131
to crazy overtime.

04:59.716 --> 05:03.344
Well, all I know is
I had to raise a little hell in there.

05:03.761 --> 05:07.473
But sometimes that's what you gotta do
to get the proper forms.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.183
<i>And switching now
to a breaking story,</i>

05:09.267 --> 05:12.145
<i>we go live to the Heimlich County
Animal Control Department.</i>

05:12.228 --> 05:15.732
<i>A 12-foot-long Burmese python
escaped earlier today.</i>

05:15.815 --> 05:17.066
<i>From what we can piece together,</i>

05:17.150 --> 05:20.236
<i>an untrained animal hobbyist, Hank Hill,</i>

05:20.320 --> 05:21.988
<i>purchased this animal as a joke,</i>

05:22.071 --> 05:25.158
<i>grew bored with it, and apparently
flushed it down the toilet.</i>

05:25.241 --> 05:26.617
That's not true!

05:26.701 --> 05:28.077
I don't believe this.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.996
They're lying on the news.

05:30.079 --> 05:32.165
Are they talking about Josh?

05:32.248 --> 05:34.167
<i>People think these animals make good pets,</i>

05:34.250 --> 05:36.002
<i>but they don't.
They're cold-blooded killers.</i>

05:36.461 --> 05:37.295
<i>Literally.</i>

05:37.378 --> 05:39.422
<i>Chilling.</i>

05:39.505 --> 05:41.632
<i>And now we go to
our own Nancy Hicks Gribble,</i>

05:41.716 --> 05:42.759
<i>live on the scene.</i>

05:42.842 --> 05:45.762
No, no. Don't show our house. No!

05:45.845 --> 05:46.971
<i>Thanks, Miguel.</i>

05:47.055 --> 05:48.598
<i>Neighbors, such as myself,</i>

05:48.681 --> 05:52.477
<i>describe Mr. Hill as a quiet
and somewhat rigid man</i>

05:52.560 --> 05:54.854
<i>and the last person
you'd expect to release</i>

05:54.937 --> 05:58.399
<i>such a deadly threat
into this community's hearts and homes.</i>

06:01.277 --> 06:05.156
You know, I always thought we'd be on TV
for being murdered in our sleep.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.328
Dang it, my phone is ringing off the hook.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.163
You boys need to catch this snake.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.581
That's what I told them!

06:14.207 --> 06:16.167
We are doing everything possible.

06:17.794 --> 06:21.214
The snake that was set loose
in our community is a vicious predator

06:21.297 --> 06:22.882
and it cannot be caught on the cheap.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.219
It's gonna to take time.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.972
It might take time and a half.

06:32.725 --> 06:33.851
Golden time.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.353
And hazard pay. Thank you.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.146
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.940
Our budget's too tight as it is.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.859
This is a crisis of public safety, Don.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.904
It appears my colleague
here is soft on snakes.

06:47.907 --> 06:48.783
Are you kidding me?

06:48.866 --> 06:50.618
Nobody hates snakes more than I do.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.954
Well, you sure have a funny way
of showing it.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.455
If anyone knows my history,

06:54.539 --> 06:56.040
he knows I'm tough on snakes.

06:59.627 --> 07:04.048
As chairman, I move we allocate
more money to snake eradication.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.008
This isn't about money!

07:06.092 --> 07:08.428
Just make these people do their jobs.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.888
I say we don't just allocate "some money,"

07:11.472 --> 07:13.558
we allocate all money needed!

07:15.143 --> 07:19.105
I say on top of that we get these boys
another full-time Animal Control Officer

07:19.188 --> 07:20.857
to help win my war on snakes.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.191
Well said.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.823
Hmm.

07:32.076 --> 07:34.454
Dale, get on your cleanest jumpsuit

07:34.537 --> 07:35.913
because you are going to apply

07:35.997 --> 07:38.374
for that job with County Animal Control.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.417
An opening?

07:40.084 --> 07:43.463
But I don't have the chops
to work with Tommy and Rollo.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.798
Why do you like these guys so much?

07:45.882 --> 07:48.968
So far all they've done is
blame me and asked for money.

07:49.051 --> 07:51.429
Well, I always blame you
and ask for money.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.474
Maybe I could fit in!

07:57.268 --> 07:58.269
Mr. Gribble?

07:58.352 --> 08:00.313
Yes, ridiculous name. I know.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.482
What makes you think you
can be a snake hunter?

08:02.565 --> 08:06.486
To be honest, I have no business
even sitting here with you gentlemen.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.822
I am unqualified, uncertified,
and untrained.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.240
I have no references.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.783
I am prone to nervousness,

08:12.867 --> 08:14.911
and when nervous, I vomit in my mouth.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.541
Dale, you shouldn't be
so hard on yourself.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.459
As a matter of fact,

08:21.542 --> 08:23.794
you're exactly what we're looking for.

08:23.878 --> 08:24.837
Really?

08:24.921 --> 08:25.922
Are you sure?

08:26.005 --> 08:27.048
Go on home,

08:27.131 --> 08:28.508
make love to your wife,

08:28.591 --> 08:30.885
and then come back here
ready to be a hero.

08:30.968 --> 08:31.928
But...

08:32.011 --> 08:33.221
but she's at work.

08:34.305 --> 08:35.890
I'll figure it out.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.519
He's perfect.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.897
That moron couldn't find a snake
if he was wearing it for a necktie.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.650
Kill you later!

08:46.442 --> 08:47.568
Oh, what the hell.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.079
There's no reason for this panic.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.081
There's never been one instance

09:00.164 --> 09:03.584
of a snake jumping out
of a toilet and biting someone.

09:03.668 --> 09:04.794
I even went on the...

09:04.877 --> 09:06.337
...the Web.

09:07.129 --> 09:10.383
It's funny how much one little snake can
change a man's life.

09:10.925 --> 09:14.387
My bathroom used to be
where I went to find comfort and peace.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.639
Now it's the sum of all my fears.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.016
Yeah, man, it's like I don't even
have a dang ol' place

09:19.100 --> 09:21.143
to read my dang ol' newspaper
no more, man.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.937
Don't worry about a thing.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.856
Now that Dale Gribble,
Animal Control Specialist,

09:25.940 --> 09:29.652
has joined what my wife, the media,
has dubbed Team Snake Hunt,

09:29.735 --> 09:31.362
that snake is all but caught.

09:31.821 --> 09:32.947
Sha-sha-sha.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.699
Whoa.

09:34.782 --> 09:37.743
And best part of all,
I'm working with my idols.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.746
It would be like Boomhauer working
with Wilt Chamberlin

09:40.830 --> 09:42.206
or Hank working with, uh...

09:42.957 --> 09:45.167
Dr. Propane, I'm assuming.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.752
Just promise that

09:46.836 --> 09:48.588
you'll catch that snake soon.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.590
I get more looks and whispers

09:50.673 --> 09:53.426
than that bank teller
who's in between genders.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.306
Well, this has been a great first day.

09:58.431 --> 10:03.019
You guys have introduced me to Sudoku,
and we came up with our theme song.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.396
Now, this might be the pedicure talking,

10:05.479 --> 10:07.773
but when are we gonna catch that snake?

10:07.857 --> 10:09.775
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.653
If we rush into this,
then the snake has won.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.655
-Huh.
-Gentlemen,

10:14.739 --> 10:17.950
here are your beers
and your banana splits.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.035
Enjoy.

10:19.118 --> 10:22.288
And by the way, your bill
has been taken care of.

10:22.371 --> 10:25.041
Thank you, Team Snake Hunt!

10:29.337 --> 10:30.588
Thanks, guys.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.048
Hey!

10:35.551 --> 10:38.929
<i>We begin with
an "Arlen Snake-Alarm" update.</i>

10:39.930 --> 10:41.474
Just turn the channel.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.894
I hope you're proud of yourself, Hank.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.980
'Cause of you, I gotta find
someplace besides the commode

10:48.064 --> 10:48.981
to do my business.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.024
Huh?

10:50.107 --> 10:52.943
I didn't have anything to do
with this snake.

10:53.027 --> 10:53.903
It was a gift...

10:53.986 --> 10:55.696
to… to my son...

10:55.780 --> 10:58.115
See, it was my dog's birthday...

10:59.450 --> 11:00.576
Uh…

11:00.660 --> 11:02.703
No one has anything to worry about.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.288
The toilets are safe.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.415
Don't buy into this media frenzy.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.710
Let's hear you say that
sitting on a toilet, honey.

11:11.295 --> 11:14.298
It was one of the few
pleasures in my life,

11:14.382 --> 11:16.342
and you took it away.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.928
<i>…for the shopping experience
of a lifetime.</i>

11:19.011 --> 11:22.515
<i>Drive up to the McMaynerbury
Mall, snake-free since 1982!</i>

11:31.440 --> 11:34.193
Darn! Waiting for this foam will be
the death of me.

11:34.276 --> 11:36.696
You know, the firemen have
a self-frothing machine.

11:36.779 --> 11:40.574
Yeah, and the cops have new headquarters
and those matching ATV's.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.952
Why are we always at the
bottom of the food chain?

11:43.035 --> 11:45.121
Because they all have bond measures.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.372
You know how it works.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.165
Cops can't catch criminals

11:48.249 --> 11:50.376
unless Bond Measure C passes.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.962
Librarians will shut down
the children's weading woom

11:53.045 --> 11:55.005
if Bond Measure L doesn't pass.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.216
Hmm.

11:57.299 --> 12:00.761
If Team Snake Hunt gets
its own bond measure,

12:00.845 --> 12:03.514
we can have any cappuccino
machine we want.

12:03.973 --> 12:04.932
Hell, yeah!

12:05.015 --> 12:08.686
Bond Measure... S for Snake.

12:08.769 --> 12:09.770
What do you say, brother?

12:09.854 --> 12:12.148
I don't know anything about bond measures.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.066
That's the beauty of it. Nobody does.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.693
But they all vote "Yes"!

12:15.776 --> 12:17.903
And once the bond measure passes,

12:17.987 --> 12:19.572
then we'll catch the snake?

12:19.655 --> 12:20.948
You got it, buddy.

12:21.031 --> 12:24.493
Once Bond Measure S passes,
that snake is toast.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.494
I keep looking up at the sky

13:06.577 --> 13:10.122
and wondering if Josh is
looking up at the same sky.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.500
You'll feel better after you build a bear.

13:12.583 --> 13:13.667
Hey, Hank Hill!

13:13.751 --> 13:18.422
Snake scandal devalue my property more
than Dauterive sunbathing on front lawn!

13:18.506 --> 13:20.090
It true! I checked!

13:26.096 --> 13:29.016
Dale, you'd better have
a snake in that backpack.

13:29.099 --> 13:30.726
Don't be ridiculous.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.812
How would I put a snake in my pack

13:32.895 --> 13:35.731
with all my sophisticated
snake finding equipment,

13:35.815 --> 13:38.567
like my personal ionic air purifier,

13:38.651 --> 13:41.362
my anti-fog mirror and CD player,

13:41.445 --> 13:43.697
and my monogrammed flotation device?

13:43.781 --> 13:45.574
What do you need with all that stuff?

13:47.368 --> 13:49.954
Don't be embarrassed
by your ignorance, Hank.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.413
You, as a citizen idiot,

13:51.497 --> 13:53.749
would have no idea how to catch a snake.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.875
Dang it, Dale.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.752
I made you get that county job

13:56.836 --> 13:59.922
to make sure those guys did
their job and caught that snake.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.132
Have you even looked down in the sewers?

14:02.216 --> 14:05.636
We don't just willy-nilly go
down in the sewers, Hank.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.180
It takes strategy, planning.

14:08.264 --> 14:11.183
In fact, Tommy and Rollo are
in the Snake Control Room

14:11.267 --> 14:13.936
as we speak planning our next move.

14:14.019 --> 14:14.854
The what?

14:14.937 --> 14:16.939
The Snake Control Room?

14:17.022 --> 14:19.316
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.402
It's probably just the copy room.

14:21.485 --> 14:22.528
The copy room?

14:22.611 --> 14:24.446
I don't think all the monitors, sensors,

14:24.530 --> 14:27.074
and tracking devices would fit
in the copy room.

14:27.157 --> 14:31.120
I think the Snake Control Room
is more like the Danger Room

14:31.203 --> 14:32.246
from the X-Men.

14:32.329 --> 14:33.372
So you've seen it?

14:33.455 --> 14:34.623
Of course.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.710
I mean, uh, I've been outside the door.

14:37.793 --> 14:39.545
I don't have clearance to...

14:40.170 --> 14:43.340
It's a… it's a lengthy review process.

14:44.341 --> 14:45.301
Ha.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.427
Come on, Dale.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.638
We're going to see what those
giblet-heads are really up to.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.059
Guys?

14:54.143 --> 14:57.313
Um, I know you said never to bother you

14:57.396 --> 14:58.898
when you're in the War Room,

14:58.981 --> 15:01.567
but I need to talk to you about something.

15:02.610 --> 15:03.819
Guys?

15:23.213 --> 15:24.840
You were right, Hank.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.133
They're frauds.

15:27.593 --> 15:28.969
We're going into the sewer.

15:31.180 --> 15:34.558
Let's go kill a snake and a bond measure.

15:41.273 --> 15:45.235
These public sewers are
labyrinthian... tine.

15:45.319 --> 15:48.030
Since Tommy and Rollo
never actually trained me,

15:48.113 --> 15:49.740
we could get lost down there.

15:49.823 --> 15:52.743
I'll become one of the
mysterious sewer people.

15:52.826 --> 15:55.871
Over time, my memories
of the English language

15:55.955 --> 15:58.958
will disappear, and I'll be
forced to invent my own.

16:01.752 --> 16:02.920
Get moving, Dale.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.684
"Dear Ex-Idols,

16:16.767 --> 16:18.811
someone needs to catch that snake,

16:18.894 --> 16:20.312
and I guess it's gonna be me.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.607
P.S. I signed
for your executive dart board

16:23.691 --> 16:25.150
from The Sharper Image.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.360
It's on the wall."

16:26.443 --> 16:28.362
Holy crap, he's going in the sewer.

16:28.445 --> 16:30.614
That Boy Scout is gonna
crash our gravy train.

16:30.698 --> 16:31.657
We gotta stop him.

16:34.535 --> 16:38.038
We're actually inside Arlen's colon.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.958
It's kind of spooky down here.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.253
Do you think poop has ghosts?

16:47.089 --> 16:50.509
Apparently, not everyone was
afraid to use their toilets.

16:55.139 --> 16:58.684
Look, it's a wheel
from a child's tricycle.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.895
This is a place of terrible beauty.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.148
Wait, did you hear something?

17:04.606 --> 17:05.441
Dale?

17:05.524 --> 17:07.359
Wait a second. That was Rollo's voice.

17:07.443 --> 17:08.485
They're after us!

17:08.569 --> 17:10.529
Well, how'd they even
know we were down here?

17:10.612 --> 17:12.406
Probably the note I left.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.992
Come on!
We've gotta hurry up and catch that snake.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.502
-The snake!
-Quick, grab it.

17:29.631 --> 17:31.592
I got a hold of it!

17:32.259 --> 17:34.136
It's trying to wrap itself around me,

17:34.219 --> 17:36.180
but it didn't count on my strategy

17:36.263 --> 17:38.015
of me wrapping around it!

17:44.605 --> 17:45.647
I did it!

17:47.357 --> 17:49.443
I'm not sure that's Bobby's snake.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.946
Oh, my god, it's not.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.620
Oh, Lord in Heaven above!

18:02.539 --> 18:03.874
Don't worry, Hank.

18:03.957 --> 18:07.044
I've got three weeks of exterminating
to catch up on.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.504
Where to begin?

18:08.587 --> 18:12.299
Eenie-meenie-minie kill!

18:16.303 --> 18:17.888
-Ha!
-Dale!

18:18.597 --> 18:20.474
Look at that vermin pit.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.351
More like money pit.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.645
Dale, stop killing our money right now.

18:28.398 --> 18:30.776
What the hell happened to you?

18:31.318 --> 18:34.613
You used to be reptile-and-rodent-killing
machines.

18:34.696 --> 18:37.533
Now you're practically veterinarians.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.952
Hey, nobody gave a damn about us
'till the snake showed up,

18:40.035 --> 18:42.037
and no one will give a damn
about us once it's gone.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.664
That's why you kill?

18:44.123 --> 18:45.541
For appreciation?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.334
From people like him?

18:50.254 --> 18:51.421
You know why you should do it?

18:51.505 --> 18:53.966
Because it's your job
and you're getting a paycheck.

18:55.425 --> 18:58.470
Or how about you do it
because right now Dale's wife,

18:58.554 --> 19:00.931
Channel 84's Nancy Hicks Gribble,

19:01.014 --> 19:03.350
is on her way
to the Animal Control Office.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.602
She's gonna expose what really goes on

19:05.686 --> 19:08.021
in that Snake Control Room.

19:12.818 --> 19:13.861
What do you want?

19:13.944 --> 19:16.196
I want you to end this madness

19:16.280 --> 19:18.949
and publicly repudiate Bond Measure S.

19:24.621 --> 19:25.956
There's Josh!

19:28.125 --> 19:30.127
Are you with me, brothers?

19:37.217 --> 19:38.218
Ugh.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.679
Hey, if, uh, if Bobby asks,

19:40.762 --> 19:42.681
we let Josh go on a farm.

19:42.764 --> 19:43.599
Yah!

19:47.686 --> 19:50.355
And since my raison d'etre,

19:50.439 --> 19:54.193
i.e. the Burmese python,
has been eradicated,

19:54.276 --> 19:56.945
I hereby resign my position.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.990
But what about future snake threats?

20:00.073 --> 20:02.868
Don't we need Bond Measure S
to safeguard our children?

20:02.951 --> 20:04.786
-Yes, the children.
-What about them?

20:07.206 --> 20:11.335
Bond Measure S is nothing more
than an expensive government boondoggle

20:11.418 --> 20:15.547
that in no way will help us with
our efforts in Animal Control.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.762
<i>With one percent
of the precincts in,</i>

20:21.845 --> 20:23.472
<i>we are projecting that Bond Measure A,</i>

20:23.555 --> 20:25.891
<i>"The Clean Air for Our Children
to Breathe" bond measure,</i>

20:25.974 --> 20:28.644
<i>will pass 62 percent to 38 percent.</i>

20:29.186 --> 20:30.062
Oh!

20:30.145 --> 20:31.897
You hear that, little baby?

20:31.980 --> 20:34.149
You're going to be able to breathe.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.651
<i>As did Bond Measure F,</i>

20:35.734 --> 20:37.486
<i>"The Children Are Our Future" initiative,</i>

20:37.569 --> 20:39.571
<i>with 67 percent of the vote.</i>

20:39.655 --> 20:42.324
Children really are our future, you know.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.700
<i>And in a stunning upset,</i>

20:43.784 --> 20:46.536
<i>Bond Measure S for a Snake-Free Arlen</i>

20:46.620 --> 20:50.123
<i>squeaked by with only
59 percent of the vote.</i>

20:50.207 --> 20:52.501
Tell me about the farm again, Dad.

20:52.584 --> 20:56.046
Uh, yeah, well, uh,
it's a really great place,

20:56.129 --> 20:58.966
I tell you what, especially for a snake.

20:59.049 --> 21:02.594
You know, lots of, uh,
lots of mice, I guess,

21:03.178 --> 21:04.888
that, uh, that Josh ate.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.848
That's Josh, all right.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.517
Tell me more.

21:09.101 --> 21:13.105
Oh, well, it's a... it's a good farm.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.854
