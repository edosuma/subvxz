-[organ playing]
-[people crying]

00:20.603 --> 00:23.273
Today, we honor
our angsty king,
taken too soon.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.316
If Batman were here,
I'm sure he'd echo

00:25.442 --> 00:27.152
the sentiments
of rap-rock legends

00:27.235 --> 00:30.321
and sensitive poets
Linkin Park,
but for copyright reasons,

00:30.405 --> 00:33.074
I am not allowed to say them
as this is being broadcast.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.326
I am sending around
a donation basket.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.162
If we reach the 15k needed

00:37.245 --> 00:39.164
for the rights by the end
of the funeral,

00:39.247 --> 00:40.540
I will sing.

00:40.665 --> 00:42.625
In conclusion, thank you
for mourning with us,

00:42.709 --> 00:44.627
even though being within
a few feet of the Bat Family

00:44.711 --> 00:46.212
puts you in danger
of being murdered.

00:46.338 --> 00:47.756
-[crowd gasps]
-[organ music stops]

00:47.839 --> 00:50.342
And now a few words
from the girl who always knows

00:50.467 --> 00:53.386
the right thing
to say, Batgirl.

00:53.511 --> 00:56.431
Heroes are just like everyone,
and sometimes they die.

00:59.267 --> 01:02.854
Okay, easy-breezy Batgirl,
never lets us down.

-[mechanism whirring]
-[organ music continues]

01:08.193 --> 01:10.111
[indistinct chatter]

01:11.654 --> 01:12.822
Okay, the end.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.783
We're not even close to 15k.
Thanks for coming.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.283
Please enjoy some soup.
No seconds.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.872
-Miss Harley.
-Alfie!

01:20.955 --> 01:22.207
Oh, thank God you're here.

01:22.289 --> 01:23.375
Everyone's relying
on me to be strong,

01:23.500 --> 01:24.876
and I am freaking out, man.

01:26.711 --> 01:29.422
Damn! Barnyard
on this bitch is
dank as hell, Alfie.

01:29.547 --> 01:31.466
I'll send you a case
to remember me by.

01:31.549 --> 01:33.509
I won't be returning
to the manor.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.805
Once White Collar Wine
earns me enough money to
execute a white-collar crime,

01:36.888 --> 01:40.392
I'll finally be sent
to fancy prison
with Master Wayne.

01:40.475 --> 01:41.851
But I need you to--

01:41.935 --> 01:43.603
[dramatic music playing]

01:43.728 --> 01:45.854
Oh, my God!
They're coming for me!

01:46.773 --> 01:47.816
Ahh! I've been hit!

01:47.899 --> 01:49.359
[people screaming]

01:49.442 --> 01:51.902
[toy bear squeaking]

01:52.027 --> 01:56.157
Ha! I destroyed
your sad little soup truck.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.283
Toyman!
Did you kill Nightwing?

01:58.410 --> 02:01.830
No, I just hate noodles,
and I wanted attention.

02:01.913 --> 02:03.289
[Batgirl growls]

02:04.416 --> 02:06.584
[Flash crackling]

02:08.419 --> 02:09.628
[whooshing]

02:13.216 --> 02:15.427
Even third-tier villains
are coming for us.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.096
If I get murked
by some dumb asshole
like Crazy Quilt,

02:18.221 --> 02:20.974
I'm gonna need you guys
to go to your graves
with that info.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.101
-We need to split up.
-But we're stronger together.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.811
And a bigger target.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.688
She's right.
I'm gonna call my mommy
to come get me.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.273
I'll move in
with Alysia full-time.

02:28.356 --> 02:30.900
[sighs] Okay.
Okay, silver linin',

02:30.984 --> 02:32.902
I'll move back in with Ivy.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.613
I mean, I miss waking up
to the sounds of her
tearing apart a cardboard box

02:35.697 --> 02:38.491
that's taken up all the space
in our recycling bin.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.410
Well, I guess this is it.

02:40.493 --> 02:44.122
To Nightwing,
who, in death, proved
what he never could in life,

02:44.247 --> 02:47.083
that the Bat Family is
weaker than ever.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.418
[theme music playing]

02:50.962 --> 02:54.132
[Livewire] Wow!
Nightbitch is dead.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.550
You love to see it.

02:55.633 --> 02:59.262
Another hero down!
And on your watch, Ivy.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.764
It's a good thing
I'm in the tub.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.350
-Because I'm soaked.
-[Poison Ivy] Ugh!

03:03.475 --> 03:05.352
I should call Harley.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.979
No. The most important thing
is to get your condolence
statement out there.

03:08.063 --> 03:08.897
Bring us our phones.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.318
Veronica, you're starting
too look too amazing.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.945
Get out
before it turns you crazy.

03:16.029 --> 03:20.450
-What should I write?
-Ahh! You already posted
six hours ago.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.327
You are on top of it.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.661
How long have you known?

03:23.745 --> 03:25.789
Wait. What? Let me see that.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.708
"Thank you to everyone
who's been reaching out
about Nightwing's death.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.418
As I sit here
in my power caftan,

I feel grateful
for the guidance

03:31.795 --> 03:33.421
of my dear mentor, Lex Luthor."

03:33.505 --> 03:34.714
I did not write that.

03:34.839 --> 03:36.257
Who has access
to your account?

03:36.341 --> 03:37.425
[sighs] Oh, my God.

03:37.509 --> 03:38.677
My PR team. My PR team!

03:38.802 --> 03:40.512
They need
to run things by you first.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.305
My team always gives me
three options.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.016
Funny, sassy, horny.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.268
Wait, you don't give
all your passwords
and your PINs

03:47.352 --> 03:48.520
and your keys to your PR team?

03:48.603 --> 03:50.271
The only person who has my PIN

03:50.355 --> 03:51.856
lives in a cage
under my kitchen table.

03:51.981 --> 03:54.859
Shit. I... I need to have
a chat with the Jons.

03:54.942 --> 03:57.862
Uh, wow, girl.
Where would you even be

03:57.946 --> 04:01.282
without the Evil Women
in Business Collective.
[chuckles]

04:01.366 --> 04:03.118
To us!

04:03.201 --> 04:06.287
[clears throat] Thank you,
uh, for gathering
for this family meeting.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.039
I have a big announcement.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.958
It's muy importante.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.835
[sighs] So embarrassing

04:11.918 --> 04:13.795
Just speak full Spanish
or full English.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.548
-My bad, lo siento.
-Dad!

04:16.673 --> 04:19.843
Kids, Bethany, mi amor,

04:19.926 --> 04:23.263
I'm going back to villainy!
[laughing evilly]

[Bethany gasps]

04:24.681 --> 04:26.725
Ay, pero,
this is a big change.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.727
The kids just got used
to the chore wheel.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.563
-Screw the chore wheel.
-What about
our health insurance?

04:31.688 --> 04:34.441
I'll blow up any hospital
that sends us a bill.

04:34.566 --> 04:35.984
Will you blow up my PE coach?

04:36.067 --> 04:37.736
Can I have some poison gas
for my science project?

04:37.819 --> 04:38.737
[Joker chuckling]

04:39.571 --> 04:41.114
[chuckling continues]

04:41.197 --> 04:42.824
There's a cashier
at More For Lex

04:42.907 --> 04:45.076
who's never told me
to have a nice day.

04:45.159 --> 04:46.703
So it's settled.

04:46.786 --> 04:50.248
-Who wants to go
steal some soft serve?
-[both] Yeah.

Ive? Ivy?
Guess who's moving in?

04:59.924 --> 05:01.426
Frank, what...
What are you doing here?

05:01.551 --> 05:02.927
I thought you lived
at the office.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.679
I did until
those Jons tried
to get rid of me.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.264
They sent me
to some fucking place

05:06.348 --> 05:07.932
called Bialiya
to be "repotted."

05:08.058 --> 05:10.060
Luckily, I escaped
by eating a truck driver.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.603
The Jons? Ugh!

05:11.728 --> 05:13.438
I don't even know
what's going on
with Ivy anymore.

05:13.563 --> 05:14.939
I mean, wait.
Does she still have red hair?

05:15.065 --> 05:16.024
Tell me everything.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.817
Ooh. The NDA they made me sign

05:17.942 --> 05:20.320
is as strong as that
truck driver's will to live.

05:20.445 --> 05:25.116
[chuckles] I shouldn't
have said anything
about Bialiya. [grunting]

05:25.241 --> 05:27.827
Uh, hey, Frank,
I'm gonna wait up
for Ivy, okay?

05:29.037 --> 05:30.705

05:38.213 --> 05:39.422
-[yells]
-Bitch! Wake up.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.799
You sleep-stabbed
all the pillows.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.967
-What? No, I didn't.
-Then you kicked the TV.

05:43.093 --> 05:46.304
I was watching Bobby Flay
make a goddamn turkey burger.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.014
You opened up every closet...

05:48.139 --> 05:49.849
-[Harley screams]
-...and you screamed
for 60 seconds.

05:49.974 --> 05:51.976
You know how many closets
are up in this bitch?

05:52.102 --> 05:53.478
-[Harley screams]
-[Frank] Then you shaved
Catwoman's favorite cat.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.063
-[trimmer whirring]
-[cat shrieks]

05:55.146 --> 05:56.606
[Frank] Then you tried
to use me as a mannequin

05:56.690 --> 05:58.149
to see all
of Catwoman's earrings,

05:58.274 --> 06:00.652
even though I kept telling you
I don't have fucking earlobes.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.779
Man, I've never seen
sleepwalking like that.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.989
Sleepwalking?
Wait, wait, is Ivy here?

06:05.073 --> 06:07.492
No, she just dropped in
and changed from her spa blazer

06:07.617 --> 06:08.910
to her business blazer.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.537
Then she tripped
over that box on the way out.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.831
She was so goddamn pissed
at whoever left it there.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.541
Don't worry, though.
I covered for you.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.501
She didn't even notice
I was here?

06:16.584 --> 06:18.003
That's how covering works.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.754
-You're welcome.
-[sighs]

06:19.838 --> 06:22.090
Do you think Ivy ordered
the hit on Nightwing?

06:22.173 --> 06:27.429
Mr. Snart, are you trying
to get top secret information
from me?

06:27.512 --> 06:28.847
[slurps] Mm.

Oh, welcome-back-

06:34.019 --> 06:37.689
[chuckles] I feel so supported.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.691
Okay, that makes
more sense. [chuckles]

06:39.774 --> 06:41.860
Don't you have
some IT junk to do?

06:41.985 --> 06:43.361
I do. [chuckles]

06:43.445 --> 06:45.989
And I'm very happy
the LOD has
a childcare program.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.366
We don't have
a childcare program.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.201
[chuckles] I made sure of it.

06:50.284 --> 06:52.328
Oh, edgy.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.039
Very modern.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.541
[King Shark sobbing]

06:56.624 --> 07:00.837
I wish I had a single shred
of self-respect.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.257
[man screams] Why?

07:04.382 --> 07:05.342
What's with all this hubbub?

07:05.425 --> 07:07.385
That shark stole my wish.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.970
Daddy's coming!

07:09.929 --> 07:11.348
My babies!

07:11.431 --> 07:14.517
Oh, look at these pups,
suckling on my
cocktail weenies.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.019
I forgot what a good dad I am.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.812
Oh, I am so sorry.

07:17.896 --> 07:20.231
I really thought
I could be
a single working dad

07:20.357 --> 07:21.566
like one of those romcoms

07:21.691 --> 07:23.234
where it's challenging
at first,

07:23.360 --> 07:25.320
but at the end
of a fun montage,

07:25.403 --> 07:26.571
you balance it all.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.365
Look me in the eye.
You can do this.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.741
Dads can have it all.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.034
So, how did you do it?

07:31.117 --> 07:33.703
Great question.
I'll show you.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.457
[sniffs, sneezes] Ugh!

07:37.582 --> 07:39.626
Oh, oh, I... Ivy.
Um, you're back early.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.753
Yeah, go ahead
and give me my passwords

07:41.878 --> 07:44.047
to my socials and my laptop.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.258
Also, why do all of my bras
have underwire now?

07:47.342 --> 07:49.594
Excuse me.
If there's no wire,
it's a bralette.

07:49.678 --> 07:50.762
Wait, there's more of you.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.223
Yes, there is so much to do.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.891

-[Jon 6 gasps]
-Jon, tell this boss bitch
her new schedule.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.857
[groans] Your line
of business corsets
is about to drop,

08:02.941 --> 08:04.651
so you'll be appearing
on Good Evening Bludhaven.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.278
And you'll need to take photos
with the Poison Ivy doll

08:07.404 --> 08:09.656
once they're reissued
with less realistic buttholes.

08:09.781 --> 08:13.868
But, yay, top of your agenda,
judging the first annual
Lil' Poison Miss Ivy contest!

08:13.952 --> 08:17.580
That's' right, sis.
You're ready
to appear with children.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.124
It's the coup de grace for PR.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.875
If you hook 'em
when their brains
are still mushy,

08:20.959 --> 08:23.128
you'll have a little Ivy Army
to debone frackers,

08:23.253 --> 08:25.755
and we'll be
the most powerful PR team
in the world.

08:25.839 --> 08:29.968

gonna be doing
a kiddie pageant.

-Oh, we see.
-No pageant, no problem.

[Robin] I can't believe
Nightwing had a tracker
he kept hidden from us.

08:51.322 --> 08:54.451
I can't believe he hid it
under a fake rock
by the back door.

Rest his poor basic soul.

at least we have a clue, right?

may have to do with his murder.

kind of distracting.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.717
Your girlfriend
just posted celebrating
our colleague's death.

09:10.842 --> 09:14.471
Every celebrity has
to post about any other
celebrity's death, okay?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.806
Lucius, how long will it take
to get into that tracker.

09:16.890 --> 09:20.685
Again, it's not a tracker.
It's the tracker's receptor.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.605
It's going to show you
where the tracker is.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.316
Oh, God, they found us. Help!

09:26.399 --> 09:27.734

-[phone beeps]

09:29.444 --> 09:30.904
[Talia over phone] Damien,
this is your mother.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.322
I sent my associates
to procure you.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.448
Go with them.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.741
Sounds like my momma needs me.

09:34.866 --> 09:37.035
You gals got this? Deuces.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.537
Oh, damn.
We're dropping like flies.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.456
Okay, it's just you and me now.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.875
We should really talk,
just jam and say how we feel
about all this.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.294
-I'm good.
-Babs, come on.
This isn't healthy.

09:46.378 --> 09:47.712
You know what's not healthy?

09:47.796 --> 09:49.589
Trying to act
like everything's normal

09:49.714 --> 09:53.635
when your coworker's girlfriend
killed your other coworker.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.095
Ivy did not kill Nightwing.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.389
She's the head
of the Legion of Doom.

09:57.472 --> 10:00.850
There is no way
she didn't have
something to do with this.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.977
Uh. [chuckles] Yeah.
Okay, good.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.813
Just keep letting those
emotions out, girl.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.314
Even if you don't mean
everything that you're saying.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.191
[Batgirl screaming]

10:08.274 --> 10:10.235
-[Lucius] My mug!
-[Harley] Not the tracker!

10:10.360 --> 10:11.569
[tracker beeping]

10:11.653 --> 10:14.030
[gasps] The power
of senseless violence.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.659
It's at the Legion of Doom.

[phone vibrating]

10:22.539 --> 10:24.416
[engine whirring]

10:27.961 --> 10:29.629
Sorry, babe. I'm in a meeting.
I can't talk right now.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.297
-I love you. You look great.
-Wait!

10:31.423 --> 10:33.633
Hey, looks like
you guys hit
Mama Mac's for lunch.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.510
Very dope. Hey, insider tip,

10:35.593 --> 10:39.389
they give
free mozzarella sticks
every time a hero dies, so...

10:39.472 --> 10:41.433
Oh, now you're interested
in what we're up to?

10:41.558 --> 10:43.059
You treated us like real shit.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.562
And everyone knows about
the free mozzarella sticks.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.604
No, I-I-I know.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.606
Look, I'm sorry, I fucked up.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.442
I fucked up your debut,
and I should have been
focusing on you guys,

10:50.525 --> 10:52.318
not sexy beverage collabs.

10:52.444 --> 10:54.237
You can't have
our leftovers, okay?

10:54.320 --> 10:55.905
[Poison Ivy] All right,
let me level with you.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.116
I really need your help
to get rid of my PR team.

10:58.241 --> 11:01.828
You're the only people
I trust to help me.
Except maybe Bane.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.079
But no one knows
where he is, so...

11:03.163 --> 11:04.998
That sounds
challenging for you.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.334
But we remain
very wounded
by your negligence.

11:07.459 --> 11:09.711
Could you please
just help me now? And then,

11:09.794 --> 11:11.713
we can work on the forgiveness
part afterwards.

11:13.048 --> 11:15.342
-Whatever, fine.
-Yes! Oh, my God. Yes.

11:15.467 --> 11:18.136
Hey, Terra. Could you,
like, get us some privacy?

11:19.429 --> 11:22.724
Okay, how are we gonna
pummel these PR pricks?

11:25.393 --> 11:28.063
There you are,
my esteemed PR team.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.647
I've had a change of heart.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.524
-Oh?
-Hmm. Have you?

11:31.649 --> 11:34.861
I have decided to host
the Little Poison
Miss Ivy contest after all.

11:34.986 --> 11:38.907
-[all gasp] Yes!
-Yeah, I realized it's
in creative alignment

11:38.990 --> 11:41.493
with my brand intentions.

11:41.618 --> 11:42.786
Yes, go off, Queen.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.914
And I see how it will
help me leverage

11:45.997 --> 11:49.250
my identity
as a, uh, thought leader.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.752
-Ooh.
-My girl.

11:50.835 --> 11:54.673
And since this will be
my biggest
public facing event yet,

11:54.756 --> 11:56.257
I'd like to order a...

11:56.341 --> 11:58.176
-Uh-huh, yeah...
-Oh, don't you
fuckin' say it! Oh!

Step and repeat!

-Oh!
-[Jons laughing]

12:02.430 --> 12:04.391
[cheering, moaning]

12:08.144 --> 12:10.021
I have no idea
why moms are so miffed.

12:10.105 --> 12:12.065
Everything you need
to raise a kid is
in the workplace.

-[baby shark gurgling]
-[Gordon] Look!

12:14.192 --> 12:16.945
This thingy does
white noise, and...

12:18.238 --> 12:20.865
spits out precious memories.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.951
And what used
to tickle Babs to death?

12:23.034 --> 12:25.036
[chuckles]
Gory crime scene photos.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.038

-Oh, the memories.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.209
Oh, thanks.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.086
I can't remember the last time

12:33.211 --> 12:35.839
I was able to take
a shit by myself.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.465
[Barbara] All right,
where's your
girlfriend's office?

12:37.549 --> 12:39.801
Uh, whatever happened
to detective procedure

12:39.884 --> 12:41.177
that you guys are so
fucking obsessed with?

12:41.261 --> 12:42.887
We're following the tracker.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.681
We don't know where
it's gonna lead yet, okay?

12:44.764 --> 12:45.932
Whoa, Harley.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.517
Were you in
on killing Nightwing?

12:47.600 --> 12:48.727
A long con?

12:48.810 --> 12:49.811
I dig.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.563
Psh! These fucking guys.

12:51.688 --> 12:52.981
-Obviously, I'm not.
-Zip it.

very helpful for me today.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.966
Well, what can I say?
I've got the royale touch.

13:21.676 --> 13:22.761
Is that allowed?

13:22.886 --> 13:24.429
For dads it is.

13:24.554 --> 13:26.765
[baby shark gurgling]

13:26.848 --> 13:30.393
Since they're sleeping,
I'm gonna force myself
to take another shit.

[King Shark laughing]

13:33.104 --> 13:34.773

-Oh, Babs. Stealing
a buzzer from a baby.

13:47.452 --> 13:48.953
You always were
a jealous child.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.622
Why the hell do you have this?

13:50.747 --> 13:52.040
Christ on a cabbage!

13:52.123 --> 13:53.917
I found it in a parking garage.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.336
It's a Mama Nacaroni's buzzer.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.296
See? "MN"?

13:58.380 --> 14:00.465
It's not a buzzer.
It's a tracker.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.008
"NW." Nightwing?

14:02.133 --> 14:03.843
Ugh! It's covered in drool.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.679
Now we can't test it
for forensics.

14:05.804 --> 14:06.888
Look at you.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.473
A detective like your old man.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.767
Everything she knows,
she got from me.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.560
[sighs heavily] Shut up!

14:13.144 --> 14:14.479
Whoa! Chill!

14:14.604 --> 14:16.523
That Bat Family does not
destroy personal property.

14:16.648 --> 14:20.485
Oh, I see.
You don't want me to destroy
your girlfriend's office,

14:20.568 --> 14:22.696
even though
she destroyed our family.

14:22.821 --> 14:24.239
Ivy's a villain, okay?

14:24.322 --> 14:25.657
But I'm telling you,
she would never do this to me.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.742
Let's see how long
it takes her to confess

14:27.826 --> 14:30.161
after I beat
the shit out of her.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.499
-[Barbara grunts]
-All right, I'm gonna
go talk to Ivy.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.168
You have fun.
Mingle, maybe flirt a little.

Hey! Where are you going?

14:40.505 --> 14:42.924
Hey! Yeah, you! Pour me a shot.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.262
Ivy! Ivy, hi. Listen.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.681
Tell me you didn't murder
my coworker, please.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.057
Uh, sorry, one sec.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.100
Harls, not a good time.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.518
Just answer the question!

14:53.643 --> 14:54.853
Did you have anything
to do with Nightwing?

14:54.936 --> 14:56.438
Okay. Wow!

14:56.521 --> 14:58.273
Hello. Do you really think
that I would do that to you?

14:58.356 --> 15:00.400
I... I don't...
I don't know. I don't know.

15:00.525 --> 15:01.818
-Well, I didn't.
-Oh, thank God.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.028
But, honestly, babe,

15:03.153 --> 15:04.863
if someone
who works for me did,

15:04.988 --> 15:06.489
then, I don't know,
good for them.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.158
You know,
I run an evil business,

15:08.241 --> 15:10.410
and Nightwing would be
a pretty big get.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.704
-Ivy!
-[sighs] Honey, I can't deal
with this right now.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.040

a children's beauty pageant.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.460
But you always say
kids with good posture

15:18.543 --> 15:20.337
give you the creeps.

[spits]

15:22.881 --> 15:26.051
Well, will you look at this?
Tied up, taking shots.

15:26.176 --> 15:28.386
You're a chip
off the old block.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.180
How about I take you
to Mama Nacaroni's?

15:30.263 --> 15:31.890
Someone just gave me
a gift card

15:32.015 --> 15:33.850
-'cause they saw me
being an amazing dad.
-[Barbara spits]

15:33.933 --> 15:36.311
It's Macaroni's. M.

15:36.394 --> 15:40.732
Well, I'm pretty sure
Nacaroni is how
they pronounce it in Tuscamy.

15:40.857 --> 15:44.402
God! You don't know the name
of my favorite restaurant.

15:44.486 --> 15:47.238
And you didn't even call me
when Nightwing died.

15:47.364 --> 15:50.325
[sentimental music playing]

15:50.408 --> 15:52.911
Oh, I'm not teething,
you idiot.

15:52.994 --> 15:54.913
Now leave me alone!

15:55.038 --> 15:57.374
At least I got
eight little reptiles
that love me.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.726
We have gathered at the base
of this sacred goddess,

16:16.810 --> 16:19.646
to decide which of these
precocious children

16:19.771 --> 16:23.274
is most likely to be
the next Poison Ivy.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.113
Seriously, thank you.
It's too much.

16:28.196 --> 16:31.449
[sighs] Looking out
at all these young faces,

16:31.574 --> 16:33.660
I'm reminded of a simple truth.

16:33.785 --> 16:38.206
That none of you
will ever be like Poison Ivy.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.290
[crowd gasping]

16:40.375 --> 16:44.546
I was created
by a freak accident in a lab,

16:44.629 --> 16:46.256
and through
some fucked-up miracle,

16:46.339 --> 16:48.466
I got superpowers
instead of dying.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.970
That, combined with being
a straight-up genius,

16:52.053 --> 16:54.222
is what makes me, me.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.974
Also, I'm objectively gorgeous.

-So, guys, give up.

-Oh, my God.
This is a publicity nightmare.
-Cut her off!

17:01.938 --> 17:04.441
-Any questions?
-Even if these girls
don't grow up to be you,

17:04.523 --> 17:08.361
surely they won't grow up
to be special in their own way?

17:08.486 --> 17:10.571
No. Yeah,
I'm scanning them right now,

17:10.655 --> 17:12.156
-and they're
forgettable at best.

to my live audience.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.912
Oh, yeah. Happily. Yeah.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.290
So, while we're live,
guys, everyone look
underneath your seat

17:20.373 --> 17:22.625
for a commemorative,
Poison Ivy doll,

17:22.709 --> 17:25.127
whose final design
I personally approved.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.921

not ready yet.

butthole so realistic?

Fuck almond milk!

[Jons] No!

17:34.304 --> 17:36.014
I know, I'm just, like,
no good at this PR stuff,

17:36.139 --> 17:39.726

just gonna have
to resign in disgrace, right?

I'm only having sugar
on Saturdays.

18:31.236 --> 18:32.404
[vomiting]

18:36.908 --> 18:37.826
[grunting]

18:40.245 --> 18:41.371
[screaming]

18:45.625 --> 18:47.919
As a fan of bar fights
and emotional releases,

18:48.003 --> 18:49.337
I am loving this.

18:49.421 --> 18:52.215
Oh, hell no! [grunting]

18:52.298 --> 18:53.675
Thank you for using salad.

18:53.758 --> 18:54.843
[gags]

18:55.969 --> 18:57.721
[people screaming]

18:57.804 --> 19:00.682
Guys, this seems like
good of a time as any
for your debut.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.522
Everybody,

19:07.605 --> 19:11.151
I'd like to introduce
the Natural Disasters.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.278
Time to rock.

19:13.403 --> 19:15.363
[rumbling]

19:16.865 --> 19:17.866
[woman gasps] Yes.

19:26.082 --> 19:26.958
[Poison Ivy screaming]

19:28.126 --> 19:31.004
Yes, yes. Now spit in my mouth.

19:31.129 --> 19:31.963
Ugh.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.468
[crumbling]

19:37.594 --> 19:39.971
You look a little inflamed.

19:40.055 --> 19:40.972
Get it, girl.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.352
Uh, I need to work
on a catchphrase,

19:45.477 --> 19:48.313
but here comes my thing.

19:49.939 --> 19:50.857
[energy trilling]

19:50.982 --> 19:54.277
[heart beating]

19:57.489 --> 19:59.115
[baby sharks snarling]

19:59.199 --> 20:00.408
[Giant Jon grumbling]

20:02.160 --> 20:03.495
[baby sharks yelling]

20:06.247 --> 20:07.290

20:08.917 --> 20:10.752
[whooshing]

20:10.835 --> 20:12.295
[baby sharks chittering]

20:13.922 --> 20:14.756
[Terra yelling]

20:16.841 --> 20:17.884
[Terra grunts]

20:21.930 --> 20:25.308
Oh, letting your underlings
fight your battles for you?

20:25.392 --> 20:26.851
The optics are bad.

20:26.935 --> 20:28.561
You need us.

20:28.687 --> 20:32.065
Your greatest accomplishment
was getting a nut milk

20:32.190 --> 20:33.233
to accept me.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.985
[snarling]

20:36.069 --> 20:38.988
[whimsical music playing]

20:39.072 --> 20:40.949
-[Giant Jon groaning]
-[baby sharks] Wee!

20:43.493 --> 20:44.869
[Giant Jon grunts]

20:45.662 --> 20:47.622
We were scaling up to oat.

20:47.706 --> 20:50.208
Part of a five-point plan.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.376
Oh!

20:53.878 --> 20:55.797
[cheering]

20:56.715 --> 20:58.091
Oh, my goodness. [chuckles]

20:58.216 --> 21:01.678
Look at you, cheering
for a giant man exploding.

21:01.761 --> 21:05.265
Gosh! Maybe
you little freaks
can be like me after all.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.391
[kids cheering]

21:06.516 --> 21:08.560
-[Babs sighs]
-Babs. Hey.

21:08.643 --> 21:10.562
I talked to Ivy, okay?
She didn't do it.

21:10.645 --> 21:13.940
Yeah. Then who did?
Santee Claus?

21:14.065 --> 21:15.483
[Harley groans]

21:15.567 --> 21:17.068
[Joker laughs wickedly]

21:17.152 --> 21:21.072
[chuckling]
Did someone order
a rum and Joke-er?

21:21.156 --> 21:22.615
Well, I'm a little rusty.

21:22.741 --> 21:23.825
Whatever!

21:23.908 --> 21:27.037
The fuck is this
municipal dickwad doing here?

21:27.120 --> 21:31.666
I'm here to announce
my return to evil.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.836
I know how much
you've all been
missing me, so...

21:34.919 --> 21:37.714
I brought back
one of my classic hits.

21:37.797 --> 21:41.843
Killing a member
of the Bat Family. [laughs]

21:41.926 --> 21:44.054
I killed Nightwing!

21:44.137 --> 21:46.097
-[laughing maliciously]
-Rum and Joker.

21:46.222 --> 21:49.309
[all chanting] Rum and Joker,
rum and Joker,

21:49.434 --> 21:52.854
Rum and Joker.
Suddenly, I want a drink.

21:52.937 --> 21:56.941
[Barbara grunts]
You son of a... [grunts]

21:57.025 --> 21:58.026
[Barbara crying]

21:59.319 --> 22:00.945
[Joker laughing]

22:01.071 --> 22:03.615
[chanting continues]

22:09.287 --> 22:11.623
What... What, am I dreaming?

22:15.043 --> 22:16.544
What the fuck?

22:16.628 --> 22:18.797
