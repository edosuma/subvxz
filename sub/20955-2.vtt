WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.803
CAMILA: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:02.836 --> 00:06.040
MAN: You don't know me, Teresa.
Guero's dead.

00:06.074 --> 00:07.641
We had a deal.
No time if I talk.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.009
My boss is done with all that.

00:09.043 --> 00:10.978
Help us take down Camila.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.880
Do you have any idea
what you're asking me to do?

00:12.913 --> 00:14.915
I told you
I didn't want my hands dirty.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.684
EPIFANIO: This is
Aurelio Casillas.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.752
The book your boyfriend,
Guero, gave him

00:18.786 --> 00:20.554
is causing his cartel grief.

00:20.588 --> 00:23.191
There are a lot of stories
about me in that book.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.559
You have a top lieutenant
in prison.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.595
(explosion)

00:27.628 --> 00:29.897
CAMILA: I can take him
out of there for you.

00:29.930 --> 00:32.800
And if you do, Camila,
we will be friends.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.937
(distant horses neighing)

00:52.886 --> 00:54.555
(speaking Spanish)

01:03.731 --> 01:05.266
(door closes)

01:05.299 --> 01:08.436
What, you don't sit down
to eat in Dallas?

01:08.469 --> 01:10.371
Sit.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.740
You know how to make
a guy feel welcome, Jimenez.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.275
Want me to light some candles,

01:14.308 --> 01:16.310
or are you here
to pet the horses?

01:16.344 --> 01:18.812
No, I'm here on business.
Maybe show some respect.

01:18.846 --> 01:21.149
So you want a statue because
you jumped from the kid's table

01:21.182 --> 01:22.283
to the table with men?

01:24.318 --> 01:26.487
(grunts)

01:26.520 --> 01:30.291
(laughs)

01:30.324 --> 01:34.128
Finally, the man I've heard
so much about shows up.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.298
(speaking Spanish)

01:37.331 --> 01:40.301
(tense music)

01:40.334 --> 01:47.341
*

01:52.680 --> 01:55.649
(gentle piano music)

01:55.683 --> 01:58.419
*

01:58.452 --> 01:59.653
Consultant.

01:59.687 --> 02:01.489
Executive consultant.

02:01.522 --> 02:04.425
Titles and appearances are
very important for these people.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.594
Especially for you and I.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.096
I gave you that dress
and those shoes for a reason.

02:09.129 --> 02:12.800
I hope they look good
because they feel horrible.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.001
We're here on business.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.003
One drink. Top shelf only.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.272
Never finish the glass.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.873
Now, tell me,
are you gonna wear that dress,

02:19.907 --> 02:22.743
or are you gonna continue
to let it wear you?

02:24.345 --> 02:26.714
That's Cole Van Awken.

02:26.747 --> 02:30.951
He's the owner of the law firm
that brokered the purchase.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.687
Teo Aljarafe's boss.

02:33.721 --> 02:36.990
Must be around somewhere.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.193
Camila needs product.

02:39.227 --> 02:41.529
Can you get it for us or not?

02:41.562 --> 02:43.331
I don't see any money.

02:43.364 --> 02:46.033
It's on Camila's word.
The money will come.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.968
She's working on it now.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.471
We got your brother out.
Seems like you owe us.

02:50.504 --> 02:54.542
Come here.
Let me show you something.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.744
(speaking Spanish)

02:56.777 --> 02:58.879
Míralo!
(clicks tongue)

02:58.912 --> 03:01.715
I'm hosting
the cartel race this year.

03:01.749 --> 03:05.586
And this horse--
this horse was a lock.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.421
I invested millions,

03:07.455 --> 03:09.857
and now the only money
I'll make back is from his dick.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.158
That's a shame.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.562
But what's your point?

03:14.595 --> 03:16.096
Just because something
was once valuable

03:16.129 --> 03:18.932
doesn't mean it still is.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.601
Given the current climate,

03:20.634 --> 03:24.905
most would be fearful
to do business with Camila.

03:24.938 --> 03:28.041
But if you want any product,

03:28.075 --> 03:31.379
you're gonna
have to pay in cash.

03:31.412 --> 03:34.415
(speaking Spanish)

03:35.416 --> 03:37.451
-(chuckling)
-I'll see you later.

03:37.485 --> 03:40.187
(overlapping chatter)

03:40.220 --> 03:42.222
-Mrs. Vargas.
-Hi.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.457
-Lovely to see you.
-This is Teresa.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.259
-Teresa.
-Nice to meet you.

03:45.293 --> 03:47.194
So your shipping business
really seems to be taking off?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.896
-All thanks to your firm.
-Hmm.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.931
Teo did a very good job
with the purchase.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.767
Great lawyer.
His timing not so much.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.703
KELLY ANNE: Hey, sweetie.
-Oh.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.606
Camila, Teresa,
this is my wife, Kelly Anne.

03:58.639 --> 04:02.209
Or as I like to call her,
my highest paid employee.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.944
(chuckles)

04:03.977 --> 04:06.280
Your house is beautiful,
Mrs. Van Awken.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.549
I picked out
every piece in this place.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.884
The last name just came with it.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.720
-Call me Kelly Anne.
-Teresa.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.655
I'm an executive consultant
with Camila's company.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.324
Executive.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.758
Isn't that impressive?
You hear that, honey?

04:17.791 --> 04:19.560
-Hmm.
-Huh!

04:19.593 --> 04:22.730
-Beautiful dress.
-Thank you.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.665
Nice meeting you.
If you'll excuse me.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.567
Sure.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.237
-Excuse me.
-Nice to meet you.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.172
Are we in business?

04:32.205 --> 04:35.142
Jimenez agreed to sell,
but it's cash only.

04:35.175 --> 04:36.910
Our credit's gone.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.079
How easily men forget.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.515
His brother would be rotting
in jail if it wasn't for us.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.351
King George said
he'd ship for us,

04:43.384 --> 04:45.586
but I don't think
he can wait long,

04:45.619 --> 04:48.489
so we need that cash fast.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.624
I think Teo
can help us with that.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.626
Excuse me.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.028
(tense music)

04:55.062 --> 04:56.597
-Teo.
-Hi.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.931
*

04:57.965 --> 04:59.867
Come on.

04:59.900 --> 05:04.572
*

05:08.976 --> 05:10.110
What's all this?

05:10.143 --> 05:12.713
-Privacy.
-Hmm.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.982
I need to access
$3 million from my account.

05:15.015 --> 05:18.552
Epifanio still has
your accounts frozen.

05:18.586 --> 05:21.689
And honestly, now's not the time
for any big moves.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.691
Is that so?

05:23.724 --> 05:25.926
Yeah. There's a lot
of heat out there.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.899
No harm in caution, right?

05:31.932 --> 05:34.402
*

05:34.435 --> 05:35.969
Take your shirt off.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.506
Are you kidding?

05:38.539 --> 05:39.973
You think I'm wearing a wire?

05:40.007 --> 05:42.009
Come on, Camila.

05:42.042 --> 05:49.049
*

06:01.061 --> 06:03.664
(scoffs)

06:03.697 --> 06:09.437
*

06:09.470 --> 06:13.574
Nothing to hide.
I've always been loyal.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.743
Impressive.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.079
Your loyalty.

06:20.781 --> 06:23.784
When did you talk to the DEA?

06:23.817 --> 06:25.285
I didn't.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.721
Don't bullshit us.
Answer the question.

06:27.755 --> 06:31.358
*

06:31.391 --> 06:33.794
They approached me before
the party, but like I said,

06:33.827 --> 06:37.197
I didn't say anything to them.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.699
How'd you know?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.734
You just told us.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.637
We're good.

06:43.671 --> 06:46.574
*

06:46.607 --> 06:48.375
DEA could be
all over this party.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.910
Yeah. We cannot afford that.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.945
Let's get out of here.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.414
*

06:54.448 --> 06:55.616
I don't care what Cole says.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.284
My wine club is not a hobby.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.252
I'm a businesswoman.
An executive.

06:59.286 --> 07:00.754
Isn't that right?

07:00.788 --> 07:02.255
What's your drink of choice?

07:02.289 --> 07:06.059
Oh, don't tell me.
You're a cerveza girl.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.496
Was that racist of me?

07:08.529 --> 07:10.931
Asking a Mexican
if they like cerveza?

07:10.964 --> 07:13.233
(chuckles)

07:13.266 --> 07:15.268
I was a kept woman once.

07:15.302 --> 07:16.770
See, now
we're getting somewhere.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.338
But a cartel came,

07:18.371 --> 07:19.573
killed everyone I love,

07:19.607 --> 07:22.275
and sent me running for my life.

07:22.309 --> 07:25.445
Never looked back since.

07:25.479 --> 07:28.415
(chuckles)
Oh, shit, girl.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.983
You had me going there.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.752
Listen,
we have to exchange numbers.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.621
I'ma turn you into a wino
like the rest of us.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.957
*

07:36.990 --> 07:38.291
(speaking Spanish)

07:38.325 --> 07:40.293
Thank you.

07:40.327 --> 07:44.865
*

07:44.898 --> 07:47.668
(overlapping chatter)

07:59.547 --> 08:06.554
*

08:24.705 --> 08:27.407
Hey, beautiful.

08:27.440 --> 08:34.447
*

08:45.959 --> 08:47.761
(gasps)

08:47.795 --> 08:50.698
(gentle guitar music)

08:50.731 --> 08:52.600
*

08:52.633 --> 08:55.603
I'm here.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.671
Oh, my God.

08:57.705 --> 09:01.408
*

09:01.441 --> 09:03.844
I don't understand.

09:03.877 --> 09:08.749
*

09:08.782 --> 09:12.185
(whimpers)

09:12.219 --> 09:18.525
*

09:18.558 --> 09:20.928
Oh, my God.

09:20.961 --> 09:25.766
*

09:25.799 --> 09:27.534
(sniffles)

09:27.567 --> 09:31.705
I thought I'd never see you.

09:31.739 --> 09:34.207
I'm here.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.143
I'm right here.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.078
(sniffles)

09:38.111 --> 09:43.216
*

09:43.250 --> 09:46.553
Did Jimenez mention
the Cartel Horse Race?

09:46.586 --> 09:47.988
Multiple times.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.723
Lots of cash changing hands.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.091
Millions.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.160
Which is exactly what we need.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.997
We'll have to be
smart about it.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.733
We will be,
but we have no other choice.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.969
We need cash now.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.171
Find Teresa and meet me
at the house.

10:05.806 --> 10:09.943
Had a little bit of trouble
with Epifanio.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.478
I had to get out of Culiacán.

10:11.511 --> 10:14.281
You left me.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.483
It wasn't up to me.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.891
You left.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.494
Teresa, please.

10:27.527 --> 10:30.864
Please what?

10:30.898 --> 10:35.936
I had to run from our life...

10:35.969 --> 10:37.805
because you were dead.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.974
Look, Epifanio, he was--
he was on his way to kill me.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.876
(softly gasps)

10:42.910 --> 10:44.845
All right, they had
to do something, okay?

10:44.878 --> 10:47.981
-If I could go back--
-Who's they?

10:49.549 --> 10:51.151
The DEA.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.486
(tense music)

10:53.520 --> 10:55.655
You're a rat?

10:57.224 --> 11:00.160
They saved my life.

11:00.193 --> 11:03.563
What was I supposed to do?
I-I had to play along.

11:03.596 --> 11:09.703
*

11:09.737 --> 11:12.005
You gave up
Camila's warehouse?

11:12.039 --> 11:13.741
Yeah, only after I knew
you were out of there.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.675
That's bullshit.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.511
Babe, I've just--I've just
been feeding these guys bullshit

11:18.545 --> 11:20.313
until I could find
my way back to you.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.581
You're a liar.

11:21.614 --> 11:23.316
*

11:23.350 --> 11:27.855
-You're a liar.
-Teresa, listen.

11:27.888 --> 11:32.359
I did what I had to do...

11:32.392 --> 11:34.494
but nothing's changed.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.329
*

11:36.363 --> 11:40.500
I told you.
I'd give my life for you.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.536
(phone buzzing)

11:45.605 --> 11:47.741
You need to leave.

11:47.775 --> 11:50.043
Camila finds out about the DEA,

11:50.077 --> 11:51.244
she'll kill you.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.613
She will kill me.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.783
You need to go,
and never see me again.

11:55.816 --> 11:59.186
*

11:59.219 --> 12:00.954
Please.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.389
Meet me here.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.292
Just go.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.294
Go.

12:07.327 --> 12:11.564
*

12:11.598 --> 12:13.066
(door closes)

12:13.100 --> 12:20.107
*

12:26.179 --> 12:28.548
Teresa?
What are you doing in here?

12:28.581 --> 12:30.317
Are you all right?

12:30.350 --> 12:32.986
Yeah, I'm fine. Just needed
to go to the restroom.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.222
We gotta go.
Ride back with me, okay?

12:35.255 --> 12:37.090
Okay. I'll be right out.

12:37.124 --> 12:41.261

12:41.294 --> 12:43.997
(crickets chirping)

12:47.434 --> 12:51.338
-(shrieks and gasps)
-Where's your gun, huh?

12:51.371 --> 12:53.340
¿Dónde está tu pistola?

12:53.373 --> 12:56.009
In the closet.

12:56.043 --> 13:00.347
Living in a safe house
doesn't mean you're safe.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.182
(gasps)

13:02.215 --> 13:04.517
(exhales)

13:04.551 --> 13:07.921
And a gun in the closet...

13:07.955 --> 13:10.824
can't save you.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.160
All this...

13:13.193 --> 13:15.462
means nothing
if you die wearing it.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.898
Camila knows this very well.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.002
She thinks that
she knows the truth

13:22.035 --> 13:25.338
about poor girls
from Culiacán.

13:25.372 --> 13:26.473
What truth?

13:32.045 --> 13:34.214
That nothing distracts
like glitter.

13:34.247 --> 13:37.350
Camila will surround you
with distractions.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.162
Don't get comfortable, Teresita.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.833
Now,

13:53.867 --> 13:55.903
Camila needs to see you.

14:07.614 --> 14:08.882
(door closes)

14:08.916 --> 14:11.885
(suspenseful music)

14:11.919 --> 14:18.926
*

14:19.960 --> 14:22.695
The Cartel races are run
by La Mano Poderosa.

14:22.729 --> 14:25.565
That is the five most powerful
families in our business.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.367
Every year,

14:27.400 --> 14:29.869
each race is hosted
by a different one.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.738
Millions exchange hands.

14:31.771 --> 14:34.041
We need cash for product,

14:34.074 --> 14:36.076
and we're gonna steal it
from them.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.745
This year, the honor goes to our
good friend Manuel Jimenez.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.713
And out of
the four other bosses,

14:40.747 --> 14:42.950
I don't have to tell you about
Aurelio Casillas.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.285
I doubt
he's forgotten you, Teresa.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.020
He may still want you alive.

14:47.054 --> 14:49.089
*

14:49.122 --> 14:51.758
A million dollars minimum
lets you in the race.

14:51.791 --> 14:54.427
Then the money moves from
our hands to a holding cell.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.097
Then the man inside,
"El Contador,"

14:57.130 --> 14:59.532
he verifies the amount
by weighing it.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.801
Then the money moves
to counting machines

15:01.834 --> 15:03.270
just to make sure it's real.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.072
POTE: Tons of cash,

15:05.105 --> 15:06.539
but the place is a vault.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.141
Every safe can be cracked.

15:08.175 --> 15:11.111
Maybe we don't
have to steal it.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.213
If we pick the right horse,

15:13.246 --> 15:14.881
just give us the money,

15:14.914 --> 15:16.950
and the odds will pay us
whatever we need.

15:16.984 --> 15:19.419
That's if we had
a million cash to get in.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.121
We don't need it.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.556
Just need to make them
think it's a million.

15:23.590 --> 15:27.394
*

15:27.427 --> 15:30.263
What I don't know is
how to pick the right horse.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.631
CAMILA:
We'll pick the winner,

15:31.664 --> 15:33.633
and Pote can take care
of the horses.

15:33.666 --> 15:37.270
I will cook something
to slow their motivation.

15:37.304 --> 15:40.273
(upbeat Latin pop music)

15:40.307 --> 15:47.014
*

15:49.349 --> 15:51.418
JAMES: What if our horse
doesn't win?

15:51.451 --> 15:53.486
Or if they find
our bullshit money bags?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.755
Then we're all dead.

15:55.788 --> 16:00.627
*

16:00.660 --> 16:03.696
(man speaking Spanish over PA)

16:03.730 --> 16:10.537
*

16:20.213 --> 16:21.948
You didn't tell me
you were coming by.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.817
Didn't know
I needed an invitation.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.619
-New wardrobe?
-Yeah, not on what

16:26.653 --> 16:28.455
you cheap asses are paying me.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.923
Why don't you come in?
I think I got something for you.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.263
(door opens and closes)

16:39.866 --> 16:42.869
-(speaking Spanish)
-I'm good.

16:42.902 --> 16:44.704
(exhales)

16:44.737 --> 16:47.207
-So?
-You remember that--

16:47.240 --> 16:49.242
that picture you showed me?

16:49.276 --> 16:50.743
The lawyer guy
with the nice teeth?

16:50.777 --> 16:52.212
Teo?

16:52.245 --> 16:53.546
-Yeah.
-That's Camila's attorney.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.014
You said
you didn't recognize him.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.183
I hadn't,
and then I remembered

16:56.216 --> 16:57.817
this one time in Phoenix.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.187
A distributor
that Epifanio worked with.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.089
The lawyer dude--
that guy made the deal.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.223
This guy?

17:05.358 --> 17:07.494
-Is this him?
-Yeah. Yeah.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.661
We've been talking to him.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.431
Last name's Aljarafe, right?

17:11.464 --> 17:13.766
I remember 'cause it's weird.
It's, like--

17:13.800 --> 17:15.335
Como que no suena Mexicano.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.237
It's, like,
Middle Eastern or something.

17:17.270 --> 17:18.971
His dealer in Phoenix,
you got a line on him?

17:21.274 --> 17:23.710
I got the street he lives on.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.379
That could be worth something.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.348
I'll take what you got.

17:28.381 --> 17:32.018
(tense music)

17:32.051 --> 17:34.521
I'll check the odds.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.556
I'll check the horses.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.558
Vamos, Teresa.

17:38.591 --> 17:42.595
(overlapping chatter in Spanish)

17:42.629 --> 17:45.598
Each family sends a little girl
to bless the horses

17:45.632 --> 17:47.767
before the race.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.303
-It's tradition.
-(horses nickering)

17:50.337 --> 17:51.938
You mean opportunity?

17:51.971 --> 17:54.040
-Huh.
-(horses whinnying)

17:54.073 --> 17:56.743
(overlapping chatter)

17:56.776 --> 17:59.812
-Camila.
-Manuel.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.414
Glad you could make it.

18:01.448 --> 18:04.717
About the credit--
it's not personal.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.286
Business never is.

18:06.319 --> 18:09.956
By the way, you're betting
on the wrong horse.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.291
In more ways than one.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.492
(phone buzzing)

18:12.525 --> 18:14.627
Excuse me.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.063
-Yes?
-It's Blanco de Invierno.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.565
He's the best odds--
it's 12 to one.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.099
CAMILA: Make sure he wins.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.501
Place the bet.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.602
*

18:22.635 --> 18:23.736
We picked our pony.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.338
It's Blanco de Invierno.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.073
Okay.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.575
Our money's on the white horse.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.310
Blanco de Invierno.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.644
I'll tell the little girls.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.846
No, no, no. I better do that.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.115
*

18:36.149 --> 18:37.350
Hola.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.486
You girls look so beautiful.

18:39.519 --> 18:44.757
*

18:44.791 --> 18:46.459
-Are you gonna feed the horses?
-Yes.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.528
That sounds fun.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.697
So whatever you do, don't feed
the white horse, okay?

18:50.730 --> 18:51.998
-He's very mean.
-Yeah.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.966
Blanco will bite your hand off.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.502
Probably your whole arm.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.304
So be careful.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.671
*

18:58.705 --> 19:00.973
Go, princesses, go.

19:01.007 --> 19:05.978
*

19:06.012 --> 19:07.013
Really?

19:07.046 --> 19:08.348
What?

19:08.381 --> 19:10.683
(horses whinnying)

19:14.521 --> 19:17.524
(suspenseful music)

19:17.557 --> 19:24.564
*

19:29.869 --> 19:32.972
(horse neighs)

19:33.005 --> 19:34.674
(speaking Spanish)

19:34.707 --> 19:36.343
I think you got me confused
with someone else.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.411
Not so fast, Teresa Mendoza.

19:38.445 --> 19:41.848
I was thinking
we could watch the race.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.550
You and I together.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.518
I'm okay.
Really.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.487
(clears throat)

19:47.520 --> 19:49.989
I wasn't asking.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.023
So let's go.

19:51.057 --> 19:52.359
Hmm?

19:52.392 --> 19:53.426
Keep it moving.

19:54.427 --> 19:57.464
(speaking Spanish)

20:00.400 --> 20:06.973
*

20:16.616 --> 20:18.685
(sighs)

20:18.718 --> 20:22.188
(horses whinnying)

20:22.221 --> 20:24.090
Like I said...

20:24.123 --> 20:25.558
the best seat in the house.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.093
Look at this.

20:27.126 --> 20:29.061
You really have a way
with women.

20:29.095 --> 20:30.563
(exhales)
Well,

20:30.597 --> 20:32.899
most men don't appreciate
a strong woman.

20:32.932 --> 20:37.270
(speaking Spanish)

20:37.304 --> 20:39.572
Enough!

20:39.606 --> 20:41.541
She's with me now.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.410
She's not the same girl you met.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.945
*

20:45.978 --> 20:47.814
End this...

20:47.847 --> 20:50.216
so we can enjoy the race.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.985
Uh-huh.
Mm.

20:53.019 --> 20:56.956
(speaking Spanish)

20:56.989 --> 20:58.325
*

20:58.358 --> 21:00.460
(horses neighing)

21:00.493 --> 21:02.629
MAN: Two minutes to post time.

21:02.662 --> 21:09.101

21:10.036 --> 21:12.505
Hey.
Placing a bet for Camila Vargas.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.240
Got a million.
Blanco de Invierno.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.976
-Blanco Invierno?
-Yes, sir.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.278
*

21:19.312 --> 21:21.481
(horses neighing)

21:21.514 --> 21:25.418

21:25.452 --> 21:27.354
Where's Teresa?
Thought she was with you.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.288
We have bigger problems
than that.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.458
One of the horses
did not take his medicine.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.326
We got ourselves a wild card.

21:33.360 --> 21:38.264
*

21:38.297 --> 21:39.532
Don Epifanio.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.682
He's gonna make a move.
I know it.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.550
He's going to try to kill me.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.352
Then you better get
a head start.

21:59.386 --> 22:00.987
Go.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.990
(dramatic music)

22:04.023 --> 22:11.030
*

22:22.909 --> 22:25.845
Hey, where's the girl?

22:25.878 --> 22:27.380
Teresa Mendoza.
Where is she?

22:27.414 --> 22:28.815
No sé. No sé.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.216
Well, go and find her.

22:30.249 --> 22:31.818
-Go!
-Come on.

22:31.851 --> 22:35.422
-(tense music)
-(laughs)

22:35.455 --> 22:37.924
MAN: The horses are approaching
the starting gate.

22:37.957 --> 22:39.726
*

22:39.759 --> 22:41.828
They're all in line...

22:41.861 --> 22:44.196
-(gunshot)
-And they're off!

22:44.230 --> 22:45.598
(cheering)

22:45.632 --> 22:47.400
(indistinct announcing)

22:47.434 --> 22:49.101
...but it's Blanco de Invierno

22:49.135 --> 22:51.103
who rushes
and takes the early lead.

22:51.137 --> 22:54.874
Blanco de Invierno leads them
into the Clubhouse turn.

22:54.907 --> 22:58.310
(indistinct announcing)

23:01.147 --> 23:03.950
And it's still
Blanco de Invierno

23:03.983 --> 23:06.185
who takes them out
to the back stretch.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.120
He leads it by two
to Campeón Charlie

23:08.154 --> 23:10.189
who is on a side pole in second.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.258
50 Grand is on his outside.

23:12.291 --> 23:15.094
(indistinct announcing)

23:15.127 --> 23:18.598
And down the back stretch
they go.

23:18.631 --> 23:21.601
Blanco de Invierno
means business.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.369
Campeón Charlie
right there in second.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.104
Further back is 50 Grand,

23:25.137 --> 23:27.139
and Arm Candy losing touch
with his heels.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.941
And it's become
a match race between

23:28.975 --> 23:31.277
Blanco de Invierno
and Campeón Charlie.

23:31.310 --> 23:33.580
And the rest of the pack
has fallen back.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.820
Shh.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.828
Casillas' men,
they're after you.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.497
I know.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.831
Where's James?

23:52.932 --> 23:55.067
MAN: It's Blanco de Invierno
leading it by a length

23:55.101 --> 23:57.103
to again, Campeón Charlie.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.772
Then it's five lengths
to Panamanian Reverse...

23:59.806 --> 24:02.475
(announcer continues
indistinctly)

24:02.509 --> 24:04.343
And as they pass the eight pole,

24:04.376 --> 24:06.513
Campeón Charlie
strides up alongside

24:06.546 --> 24:10.249
to be nose and nose
with Blanco de Invierno.

24:10.282 --> 24:13.620
And Campeón Charlie
now gets the lead, but oh!

24:13.653 --> 24:15.655
He takes a bad step
and shifts down.

24:15.688 --> 24:20.693
And at the finish, it's
Blanco de Invierno in front!

24:20.727 --> 24:23.362
(announcer speaking Spanish)

24:23.395 --> 24:25.665
El ganador del
Poderosa Invitational,

24:25.698 --> 24:27.366
Blanco de Invierno.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.471
Hola.

24:32.505 --> 24:34.774
Collecting on behalf
of Camila Vargas.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.543
Blanco de Invierno.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.178
-Large bills will be fine.
-And pick up the pace.

24:39.211 --> 24:41.113
You should be in a better mood

24:41.147 --> 24:42.615
considering you just turned
a million dollars into 12.

24:42.649 --> 24:43.950
This is me in a good mood.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.985
-Get to work.
-Papi, Papi.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.621
(speaking Spanish)

24:48.655 --> 24:51.457
(tense music)

24:51.490 --> 24:52.625
*

24:52.659 --> 24:56.929
(both speaking Spanish)

25:01.668 --> 25:03.870
(speaking Spanish)

25:06.372 --> 25:12.845
*

25:18.450 --> 25:22.755
(speaking Spanish)

25:22.789 --> 25:25.725
Listen.
You let us bet with fake money.

25:25.758 --> 25:28.227
No matter what the truth is,
the bosses will blame you.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.229
Do you understand
what's happening?

25:30.262 --> 25:32.665
You're gonna die today.

25:32.699 --> 25:35.067
Either the bosses do it,
or he does.

25:35.101 --> 25:38.070
Your only chance to live
is to come with us.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.272
Think about your daughter.

25:40.306 --> 25:41.340
You touch my daughter
and I swear--

25:41.373 --> 25:43.175
On my word.

25:43.209 --> 25:46.378
You walk us out safely,
you get a bag of your own.

25:46.412 --> 25:48.347
What's it gonna be?

25:48.380 --> 25:55.321
*

26:02.094 --> 26:03.462
You know, that tip
you gave me about the race

26:03.495 --> 26:05.531
saved me a lot of coin.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.234
You got credit
as long as you need it.

26:08.267 --> 26:11.938
You know, sometimes it pays
to play the underdog.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.940
It's been a pleasure,
my friend.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.541
(dramatic music)

26:15.574 --> 26:17.744
Go! Straight down!

26:17.777 --> 26:21.714
*

26:21.748 --> 26:24.083
-Casillas' men.
-Take the bag.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.785
James!

26:25.818 --> 26:27.153
Casillas' men.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.821
They just want you,
not the money.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.489
Get in the truck.
Meet me down the road.

26:30.522 --> 26:32.324
-Which one?
-That one.

26:32.358 --> 26:38.765
*

26:48.007 --> 26:51.143
(muffled gunshots)

26:51.177 --> 26:53.345
*

26:53.379 --> 26:55.782
(engine revving)

26:55.815 --> 26:57.349
(tires screeching)

26:57.383 --> 26:59.786
*

26:59.819 --> 27:01.520
(engine revving)

27:01.553 --> 27:05.524
(engine roaring)

27:05.557 --> 27:09.495
(suspenseful music)

27:09.528 --> 27:12.531
*

27:12.564 --> 27:15.534
(brakes screech)

27:15.567 --> 27:17.870
-Where's the money counter?
-He took his bag and left.

27:17.904 --> 27:19.772
-His bag?
-I promised him

27:19.806 --> 27:21.607
I would give him one
to keep quiet.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.475
That wasn't yours to give.
Which way did he go?

27:23.509 --> 27:27.013
-I gave him my word.
-Hey, we gotta go.

27:27.046 --> 27:28.948
Meet back at the house.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.883
We won the race.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.319
-We have enough money to buy.
-Never leave loose ends.

27:33.352 --> 27:34.320
Go!

27:34.353 --> 27:38.024
*

27:42.094 --> 27:45.264
(motor sputtering)

27:47.767 --> 27:49.869
Chomping at the bit.
What's going on?

27:49.902 --> 27:52.872
We need 24-hour watch
on Guero, and we need it now.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.473
(sighs)

27:54.506 --> 27:56.475
For more bullshit
about Phoenix

27:56.508 --> 27:57.844
and Middle Easterns?

27:57.877 --> 27:59.245
You don't buy a shirt unless

27:59.278 --> 28:00.412
there's a girl around
to take it off.

28:00.446 --> 28:03.582
Oh, brother.
(exhales)

28:07.053 --> 28:09.088
He knows where
Teresa Mendoza is.

28:09.121 --> 28:10.757
And wherever Teresa is,
so is Camila.

28:10.790 --> 28:11.824
I get it, Loya.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.392
You're a retriever.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.394
You want to bring daddy
back the bone.

28:15.427 --> 28:17.196
Prove to me you didn't spend
the last six weeks

28:17.229 --> 28:18.831
sidling up to a worthless
piece of shit.

28:18.865 --> 28:21.167
It wasn't a waste of time.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.103
Guero's gonna lead us
to the mother lode.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.137
You watch.

28:27.573 --> 28:29.208
I dig the show of spine.

28:29.241 --> 28:31.343
Proof of concept's on you, son.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.045
WOMAN: Sir,

28:33.079 --> 28:34.847
Dallas PD pulled this
from a traffic cam.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.749
What do we got?

28:36.783 --> 28:39.451
Teo and his side piece.

28:39.485 --> 28:41.553
Papa's been a bad boy.

28:41.587 --> 28:43.355
Gets worse from there.

28:43.389 --> 28:46.592
Agent Postak.
Like a boss.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.430
Gonna need more than
a greaseball buying a T-shirt

28:51.463 --> 28:54.200
to put eyes on Guero.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.235
Teo's our boy.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.476
I've tried
to get you to hear me.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.645
You told Camila you wanted in.

29:06.678 --> 29:08.714
This is part of it.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.082
Things need to be taken care of.

29:10.116 --> 29:11.083
You mean people?

29:11.117 --> 29:12.551
Sometimes, yeah.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.120
You think you can do this
your own way?

29:14.153 --> 29:15.788
I have to.

29:15.822 --> 29:17.456
Or what?
You'll become like me?

29:17.489 --> 29:18.858
Is that what you're afraid of?

29:19.859 --> 29:21.794
You're a good person, James.

29:23.529 --> 29:25.264
(tires screech)

29:25.297 --> 29:26.765
Listen to me.

29:26.799 --> 29:28.968
There is no good or bad
in this business.

29:29.001 --> 29:31.804
There is win or lose,
live or die.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.641
Today we left a witness
who can connect us to the money.

29:35.674 --> 29:36.843
And we're short.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.444
Short when money means survival.

29:38.477 --> 29:39.478
You mean, I left a witness.

29:39.511 --> 29:40.512
We're in this together.

29:40.546 --> 29:43.415
It's on us.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.352
That thing you're trying
to keep alive inside you...

29:46.385 --> 29:48.921
it's what's gonna
get you killed.

29:48.955 --> 29:52.058
(phone buzzing)

29:53.392 --> 29:55.627
Who is it?

29:57.897 --> 29:58.998
Answer it.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.301
(phone buzzing)

30:04.736 --> 30:06.638
TONY: Teresa?

30:06.672 --> 30:08.507
Teresa, are you there?

30:11.543 --> 30:13.946
-Hello?
-Teresa.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.681
Hi, Tony,
is everything okay?

30:15.714 --> 30:17.950
Yeah, I'm fine.

30:17.984 --> 30:22.454
I'm at the motel,
but my mom's not here.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.190
You're in Dallas?

30:24.223 --> 30:26.558
My uncle brought me.

30:26.592 --> 30:28.027
We came in the bus.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.164
Tony, listen to me.

30:32.198 --> 30:34.066
You wait there, okay?

30:34.100 --> 30:35.734
I'll come by as soon as I can.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.036
TONY: Okay.

30:37.069 --> 30:39.405
Just hurry.

30:39.438 --> 30:42.174
And tell my mom I love her.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.546
I will. I love you.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.715
Love you too.

30:49.748 --> 30:51.383
Bye.

30:57.423 --> 30:58.790
It's Brenda's son.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.693
I'm taking care of him now.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.262
Camila doesn't know?

31:03.295 --> 31:05.264
Not unless you tell her.

31:13.272 --> 31:16.442
(panting)

31:16.475 --> 31:18.277
(giggling)

31:18.310 --> 31:19.878
Come on,
I thought you liked that.

31:19.912 --> 31:21.513
I just got a lot of stuff
going on.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.449
-I can do other things.
-No, no, no, no.

31:23.482 --> 31:24.683
(chuckles)

31:24.716 --> 31:26.118
People will be home soon.

31:26.152 --> 31:27.119
I gotta head back
to the office.

31:27.153 --> 31:28.754
Okay.

31:31.590 --> 31:34.726
(garage door rumbling)

31:36.128 --> 31:38.998
(sighs)
Go.

31:40.599 --> 31:42.501
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.304
Cute babysitter.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.106
Old enough to drive.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.809
Too young to vote.

31:51.944 --> 31:54.246
Such a tight little window.

32:04.023 --> 32:05.324
You did well today.

32:05.357 --> 32:07.393
Thank you.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.461
But we're missing one bag.

32:09.495 --> 32:11.763
I gave it away
so we could escape.

32:11.797 --> 32:13.699
It wasn't yours to give.

32:14.967 --> 32:17.036
-We didn't have a cho--
-But you did.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.139
You stole from me.

32:20.172 --> 32:23.109
No. It was strategy.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.843
Strategy?

32:24.876 --> 32:26.945
(chuckles)

32:26.979 --> 32:29.715
A few weeks with me and
you're already a mastermind?

32:32.718 --> 32:35.921
When I tell you
to do something...

32:35.954 --> 32:37.289
just do it.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.027
Don't forget
whose house you're in

32:41.060 --> 32:43.529
and who built it.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.264
Now,

32:45.297 --> 32:48.667
how are you gonna pay me
a million dollars?

32:48.700 --> 32:51.303
My loyalty.
I told you.

32:51.337 --> 32:53.772
Do you even know
what that word means?

32:53.805 --> 32:56.042
I can help you look the part.

32:56.075 --> 32:59.511
Your instinct
will keep you alive.

33:00.512 --> 33:02.081
But loyalty...

33:04.683 --> 33:06.552
Loyalty cannot be taught.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.555
You know how James
came to me?

33:11.323 --> 33:14.293
Before the enemy was my husband,

33:14.326 --> 33:17.329
the Castillas cartel
was fighting us over territory.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.566
So to send a message
to Epifanio,

33:20.599 --> 33:22.101
they put a hit on me.

33:23.435 --> 33:26.372
CAMILA: James had just gotten
out of the Service.

33:26.405 --> 33:28.740
He was invisible to me.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.842
Until he wasn't.

33:30.876 --> 33:32.644
I don't know if it was instinct

33:32.678 --> 33:34.546
or if he was trying
to climb up the ladder,

33:34.580 --> 33:37.549
but doesn't matter.

33:37.583 --> 33:39.718
When the assassin came for me,

33:39.751 --> 33:42.921
James proved his loyalty.

33:42.954 --> 33:44.723
No weapons.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.593
Not one word spoken.

33:49.195 --> 33:50.196
And it was done.

33:52.431 --> 33:54.200
Action...

33:54.900 --> 33:58.470
That's loyalty
without question.

34:00.239 --> 34:02.374
He's been with me ever since.

34:07.779 --> 34:10.349
Money's a little short.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.584
He must've taken some out
before I got to him.

34:13.819 --> 34:15.787
But we're good now, right?

34:19.057 --> 34:20.392
We're good.

34:27.233 --> 34:29.135
Your mistake cost a life.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.470
James just fixed it.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.272
That's loyalty.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.210
Listen.

34:38.244 --> 34:39.445
You'll be safe.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.213
We'll be all around you.

34:41.247 --> 34:42.781
You don't cross
Camila Vargas.

34:42.814 --> 34:44.316
I know.

34:44.350 --> 34:46.285
And it's a good thing
I don't have to.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.820
-You do.
-(scoffs)

34:48.854 --> 34:51.056
Cheer up.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.292
You're finally working
for the good guys.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.827
(sighs) Oh, man.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.831
Okay.

35:00.666 --> 35:03.769
Now, from where I stand,

35:03.802 --> 35:05.337
you got two choices.

35:05.371 --> 35:07.606
You go order
that overpriced steak

35:07.639 --> 35:09.408
and you get Camila talking,

35:09.441 --> 35:11.610
or...

35:11.643 --> 35:13.245
we go tell your family
you'll be missing

35:13.279 --> 35:15.481
the next couple years
for statutory.

35:20.219 --> 35:23.455
(phone buzzing)

35:25.991 --> 35:27.326
Teo, what's going on?

35:27.359 --> 35:29.761
About those funds
you requested.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.497
I think
I may have a workaround.

35:31.530 --> 35:33.199
CAMILA: Yeah,
I figured you might.

35:33.232 --> 35:35.834
We'll talk about
my cash flow over dinner.

35:35.867 --> 35:37.603
Where are you thinking?

35:37.636 --> 35:39.037
CAMILA: Same place.

35:39.070 --> 35:41.139
Usual time.

35:41.173 --> 35:42.174
You got it.

35:42.208 --> 35:45.244
*

35:49.348 --> 35:50.649
(crickets chirping)

35:58.424 --> 35:59.525
(door opens)

35:59.558 --> 36:00.526
(gun clicks)

36:02.027 --> 36:03.395
Next time, I'll knock.

36:06.565 --> 36:07.733
Is this for real?

36:07.766 --> 36:09.735
It's to help Tony.

36:09.768 --> 36:11.537
Get him someplace safe.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.739
The game, it's, um...

36:13.772 --> 36:15.674
take his mind off things.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.243
I mean, kids love those.

36:17.276 --> 36:20.412
This money's from
El Contador's bag.

36:20.446 --> 36:22.848
-If Camila finds out--
-She won't.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.551
If you don't tell her.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.386
Why are you doing this for me?

36:27.419 --> 36:29.388
It's like I said.

36:29.421 --> 36:31.189
We're in this together.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.360
Thank you.

36:34.393 --> 36:35.627
He's gonna love it.

36:43.134 --> 36:46.705
(door opens and closes)

36:46.738 --> 36:49.708
(suspenseful music)

36:49.741 --> 36:56.748
*

37:10.929 --> 37:13.899
(both speaking Spanish)

37:13.932 --> 37:20.205
*

37:20.238 --> 37:22.641
Where's my mom?

37:22.674 --> 37:24.042
Why don't you get in the car?

37:24.075 --> 37:26.144
I need to talk to you, okay?

37:26.177 --> 37:33.184
*

37:35.454 --> 37:37.389
(exhales)

37:37.423 --> 37:44.363
*

37:46.965 --> 37:50.669
There's something I couldn't
tell you over the phone.

37:50.702 --> 37:53.672
(gentle guitar music)

37:53.705 --> 38:00.178
*

38:09.488 --> 38:16.227
*

38:20.399 --> 38:22.634
I'm so sorry.

38:25.170 --> 38:27.673
(exhales)
I have a new job now.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.541
Okay?

38:29.575 --> 38:31.477
As soon as I make enough money,

38:31.510 --> 38:34.980
I'll come for you
and we'll move in together.

38:35.013 --> 38:37.315
I'm gonna make sure you're safe.

38:37.349 --> 38:38.650
*

38:38.684 --> 38:40.352
(sniffles)

38:40.386 --> 38:47.393
*

38:56.535 --> 39:03.542
*

39:13.452 --> 39:16.655
*

39:16.688 --> 39:17.889
THE QUEEN:
Pain can make you strong,

39:17.923 --> 39:19.391
or it can make you stupid.

39:20.559 --> 39:22.894
Hope those green eyes
are worth it.

39:22.928 --> 39:29.535
*

39:35.306 --> 39:37.242
-Please.
-Thank you.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.379
I wanted to
tell you this in person.

39:41.413 --> 39:44.315
Teo will not be working with you
from here on out.

39:46.251 --> 39:48.086
He was setting you up.

39:48.119 --> 39:49.755
Setting me up?

39:49.788 --> 39:50.922
With who?

39:50.956 --> 39:53.058
The DEA.

39:53.091 --> 39:54.793
Had Teo been successful,

39:54.826 --> 39:56.194
they would be investigating
me too,

39:56.227 --> 39:58.263
and that I cannot have.

39:58.296 --> 40:00.398
CAMILA: What exactly
are you saying?

40:00.432 --> 40:02.968
Teo was a risk to both of us.

40:03.001 --> 40:03.935
Was?

40:03.969 --> 40:06.772
(dramatic music)

40:06.805 --> 40:11.477
*

40:11.510 --> 40:13.979
More than anything,
I'd like this to serve as

40:14.012 --> 40:18.283
an example of just how dedicated
this firm is to you as a client.

40:20.185 --> 40:23.955
How much we value you,
Mrs. Vargas.

40:23.989 --> 40:27.225
Please...

40:27.258 --> 40:29.461
just call me Camila.

40:29.495 --> 40:31.096
Hmm.

40:31.129 --> 40:38.136
*

40:45.143 --> 40:48.113
(gentle guitar music)

40:48.146 --> 40:55.153
*

41:04.663 --> 41:11.637
*

41:21.346 --> 41:28.353
*

41:38.664 --> 41:44.970
*

41:45.003 --> 41:48.406
(dramatic swell)

41:50.441 --> 41:53.411
(soft dramatic music)

41:53.444 --> 42:00.451
*

42:05.456 --> 42:07.258
(typewriter clacking)

42:07.292 --> 42:08.393
(ding)

42:08.426 --> 42:10.428
