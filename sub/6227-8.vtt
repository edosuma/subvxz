00:00.918 --> 00:02.591
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.711 --> 00:05.430
A number of Wesen shop owners
were attacked by Wesen last night.

00:05.506 --> 00:06.826
And they're
leaving behind a mark.

00:06.965 --> 00:08.763
Look familiar?
Black Claw?

00:08.967 --> 00:11.287
And the same people
tried to kill Nick and Monroe.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.767
She just took out
20 Wesen who tried to kill me.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.146
Juliette?

00:17.684 --> 00:19.061
She's alive, and you know it!

00:19.144 --> 00:20.270
I didn't know if she
was going to survive

00:20.354 --> 00:21.901
what they were
going to do to her.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.240
The woman you
knew doesn't exist anymore.

00:24.441 --> 00:25.533
What am I
supposed to call you?

00:25.817 --> 00:26.864
They call me Eve.

00:27.277 --> 00:28.797
Why did you even
agree to meet me here?

00:34.034 --> 00:35.634
What the hell is this,
some kind of test?

00:35.744 --> 00:36.791
I'll be in touch.

00:59.101 --> 01:02.105
Honey, if you grab the fishing
gear, I'll go rent the boat.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.900
Hey, have fun.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.777
Good luck with the fishing.
 Yeah.

01:08.860 --> 01:11.329
Remember to put on sunscreen.
Okay.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.643
You gonna take
pictures all afternoon?

01:21.915 --> 01:23.337
Got to share the fun, honey.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.887
Besides, you look cute in
that life jacket.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.936
I'm so excited!

01:34.011 --> 01:35.058
Bye!

01:35.137 --> 01:37.418
I was only in the restaurant
for about five minutes.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.980
Juliette did this?
No. Eve.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.105
Who the hell is Eve?

01:41.184 --> 01:42.231
She used to be Juliette.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.689
Used to be? She's definitely
not the woman I knew.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.064
This was a planned hit.

01:46.398 --> 01:47.615
Turns out, I was her backup.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.025
- And you didn't know this?
- No.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.157
It was a test.
I found that out later.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.830
A test of what?
To see if I could survive.

01:53.905 --> 01:55.077
Or if I'd protect her.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.706
You survived and she's alive,
so I guess you passed.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.161
I hope she thanked you.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.997
She didn't stick around.
When I got out, she was gone.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.049
We know who her target was?

02:04.291 --> 02:05.543
The guy in the suit.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.970
Haven't been able to ID him
yet, or his bodyguards.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.485
They weren't
carrying identification.

02:09.545 --> 02:11.469
All I know is his
name was Samuel Rankin.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.513
He was
an organizer for Black Claw.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.344
If he didn't have ID,
how do you know all this?

02:15.427 --> 02:18.226
The guy Eve works for, he told me.
His name's Meisner.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.687
Meisner?

02:20.766 --> 02:22.860
You know him?
Yeah, I know him.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.527
He's an independent agent
working out of Europe.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.480
He was working
with the Resistance.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.316
Well, he's here now. And
he's running Eve and Trubel.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.616
And he was
working with Chavez.

02:30.734 --> 02:31.860
Chavez?

02:31.943 --> 02:33.069
So, Meisner's
a part of this group?

02:33.236 --> 02:34.237
He's in charge now.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.158
So, how do we
explain Rankin's death?

02:38.241 --> 02:39.584
Well, his bodyguards
were closest to him.

02:39.701 --> 02:40.953
So my feeling
is we blame them.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.128
If you're gonna lay
it on the bodyguards,

02:42.204 --> 02:43.484
you better find
out who they are.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.800
So, Juliette... I mean, Eve,
she's not tied to this at all?

02:46.875 --> 02:47.922
No.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.844
She never touched them.
Never even came close.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.137
Looks like they
planned this pretty well.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.302
- Do we know why Rankin was here?
- Not yet.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.593
All right, make this report
as logical as possible.

02:57.219 --> 03:00.018
At least your suspects can't
object to a murder charge.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.938
Don't you think he should
have called us by now?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.018
Who?

03:05.644 --> 03:06.645
Nick.

03:07.104 --> 03:10.779
Oh, you mean after
the Juliette reunion?

03:12.442 --> 03:13.785
Maybe it didn't go so well.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.612
I'm sure it
wasn't without drama.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.078
Maybe
we should call him.

03:19.908 --> 03:20.955
You should see this.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.327
What?

03:25.122 --> 03:28.046
Postmarked Seattle, just
like the other one you got.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.376
God, now what?

03:29.459 --> 03:31.882
Look, I really think we
got to deal with this.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.841
I mean, if you want me to
handle it, I'm happy to.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.051
Let's do it together.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.068
"Dear R,

03:47.144 --> 03:48.566
"I thought you
might write me back

03:48.645 --> 03:51.273
"after I told you
about Carlos dying.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.155
"Maybe you don't
want to hear from me.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.827
"But I don't
know what you think

03:55.944 --> 03:58.572
"about what we
used to have together.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.328
"I'm thinking about
coming to Portland..."

04:00.407 --> 04:02.501
My God, I don't
want to deal with this!

04:02.576 --> 04:06.581
Hang on a second. This guy is obviously
contacting you for a reason.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.415
Don't you think we
got to figure out why?

04:08.498 --> 04:10.466
I mean, he just said he's
thinking of coming to Portland.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.839
What does this
guy want from you?

04:12.210 --> 04:13.678
After all this time?

04:13.754 --> 04:15.131
I don't know.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.058
He thinks we had
a relationship.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.226
We didn't.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.389
Except the drug part.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.016
This is, you know...
This is just...

04:27.309 --> 04:28.526
So stupid.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.155
Honey, I got one.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.283
Oh!

04:38.653 --> 04:40.701
That's
definitely going on Facebook.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.124
Oh, please, Elizabeth. No.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.247
Just kidding.
It's going on Instagram.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.626
Allan, what's that?

04:49.331 --> 04:51.004
What?
That.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.668
Something's moving underwater.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.220
It's probably just a catfish.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.093
Pretty big for a catfish.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.561
Oh, my God.
It's swimming around us.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.598
What the hell is it?
Uh...

05:12.229 --> 05:13.629
Oh, my God,
shoot a picture of that.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.451
Oh, my God!

05:21.530 --> 05:23.077
Did you see what it was?
No.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.658
I think it's time
to go back to shore.

05:24.741 --> 05:25.958
Yeah.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.498
Allan?

05:27.744 --> 05:28.864
It's coming back!

05:33.250 --> 05:35.002
Allan? Allan!

05:35.085 --> 05:36.685
Oh, my God!
It's coming out of the water!

05:53.645 --> 05:54.988
Allan?

05:55.272 --> 05:56.865
Honey, it's right behind you!

05:56.940 --> 05:58.442
Help me!

05:58.608 --> 05:59.985
Allan!

06:00.193 --> 06:02.616
Oh, my... Allan!

06:02.988 --> 06:04.786
Allan!

06:05.031 --> 06:07.125
Allan, Allan. Allan!

06:11.037 --> 06:12.254
Allan!

06:12.747 --> 06:14.044
Allan!

06:14.332 --> 06:15.549
Allan!

06:28.805 --> 06:30.557
Allan!

06:32.183 --> 06:34.481
Allan! Oh, my God!

06:34.769 --> 06:35.986
Oh! No, no, no.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.986
Help! Allan!

06:39.190 --> 06:41.488
Help me! Allan! Help me!

06:52.120 --> 06:53.167
What the hell did you do?

06:53.246 --> 06:56.625
Guy started shooting at me,
so I had to take care of him.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.259
What do you mean,
"take care of him"?

06:58.335 --> 06:59.587
I had to put him down.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.795
You killed somebody?

07:00.879 --> 07:03.223
He had a gun!
He was trying to kill me!

07:03.298 --> 07:04.675
Allan!

07:05.508 --> 07:07.260
What was I supposed to do?

07:07.344 --> 07:09.221
It was sort of
like self-defense.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.304
Oh, my God, Wayne.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.439
Where's my money?

07:11.514 --> 07:12.686
Allan!

07:14.059 --> 07:15.151
We'll sort this out later.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.648
Allan!

07:17.020 --> 07:18.772
She's making
a hell of a racket.

07:18.855 --> 07:19.856
Help!

07:19.940 --> 07:21.658
Lucky I didn't kill her, too.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.615
Get out of here.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.115
Allan!

07:25.528 --> 07:27.622
This wasn't supposed to happen.
That guy is an idiot!

07:27.697 --> 07:28.789
Calm down.

07:28.907 --> 07:29.954
Calm down?
What are we gonna do now?

07:30.033 --> 07:31.034
Shut up.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.548
They're never gonna
connect us to anything.

07:33.578 --> 07:36.548
She'll never be able to identify him,
anyway. He was Woged the whole time.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.250
Oh, my God!
So what do we do?

07:38.708 --> 07:39.709
Help me!

07:39.793 --> 07:41.010
Call 911.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.964
I got nothing on
any of the victims.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.220
Fingerprints don't
match anything we've got.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.722
Located a rental car that
we matched to the victims,

07:48.802 --> 07:50.975
but the ID used to
rent the car was stolen.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.813
So was the credit card.

07:52.889 --> 07:53.890
What do we do next?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.442
Always dental records.

07:55.517 --> 07:56.518
Hey, Nick.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.483
I've been thinking about what
happened to you last night.

07:59.562 --> 08:00.984
Hey, Hank. Hey, Wu.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.030
Are you pissed?

08:04.776 --> 08:05.948
I'd be pissed.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.654
I am pissed.
They should've told you.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.201
It would've been nice to know
who I had to kill.

08:11.574 --> 08:14.453
That would be Samuel Rankin's
two Schakal bodyguards.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.121
Sig Ganz.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.007
Czech national, 32.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.506
I mean, not that he
was using that name.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.764
Born in Tuchomerice, recruited
by Black Claw three years ago.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.133
And Otto Gruenwaldt.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.392
Thirty-six, born
in Woltersdorf, East Germany.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.181
His father was Stasi.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.312
Black Claw enforcer,
recruited four years ago.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.018
You know anything
about Samuel Rankin?

08:38.101 --> 08:39.477
Yeah.

08:40.477 --> 08:41.946
Real name Rolf Kleinager.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.943
One of the founders of
Black Claw.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.993
I mean, we're pretty sure he met
with Alva Zajic and Arnaud Dubois

08:50.071 --> 08:52.449
10 years ago at the thermal
baths outside of Bad Zurzach.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.953
It's a small Swiss town on the
edge of the Black Forest.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.246
I mean, Kleinager
was a big kill for us.

08:58.455 --> 09:01.379
Oh, and, um, Meisner called.
That's why I'm here.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.210
He wants to talk to you.
When?

09:03.460 --> 09:04.461
Now.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.485
Obviously, we're not alone.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.781
No.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.076
You're not.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.743
There was no other way.

09:32.822 --> 09:33.914
But you proved yourself.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.124
To who?

09:35.533 --> 09:36.785
Eve.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.797
This is my room.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.924
This is where they put you?

10:34.801 --> 10:36.081
This is where
they put all of us.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.517
Who is "they"?

10:39.305 --> 10:41.728
Branch of
the federal government.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.106
Don't try to find it.
It doesn't exist.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.239
So, I suppose I've
never seen any of this?

10:50.400 --> 10:51.617
Where's Eve?

10:56.364 --> 10:57.786
I'll be here, Nick.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.336
So, Renard told me
you worked for the Resistance.

11:09.419 --> 11:10.591
I did.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.051
But this is much
bigger than that.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.008
How high up does this go?

11:15.091 --> 11:16.434
I don't know.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.477
But as you can tell,
we're not without funding.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.021
And don't ask me
where that comes from, either.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.097
'Cause I don't know.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.475
She's inside.

11:23.558 --> 11:25.105
I'll give you a few minutes.

11:26.436 --> 11:27.528
Enter.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.135
You wanted me to prove myself?

11:52.795 --> 11:53.796
You did.

11:56.591 --> 11:57.934
You should've told me.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.596
We had to know
how you would react.

12:01.846 --> 12:05.100
If you let your emotions get in
the way, you'd be no good to us.

12:10.939 --> 12:13.192
You really
believe in all of this?

12:13.274 --> 12:15.322
Not at first.
I didn't believe in anything.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.912
What about now?

12:21.199 --> 12:23.167
I found a reason to live.

12:33.336 --> 12:36.135
Do you feel remorse
for anything you've done?

12:36.214 --> 12:37.466
You mean, what she did.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.346
What you did.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.347
You still think
you're talking to Juliette.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.270
I don't know who
I'm talking to.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.023
Yes, you do.
You just won't accept it.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.655
Maybe I can't.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.246
If we're gonna work together, you
have to stop living in your past.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.929
What do you mean,
"work together"?

12:57.944 --> 12:59.992
You're here for a reason.

13:03.533 --> 13:04.955
My only regret
is that you didn't

13:05.034 --> 13:06.877
have a chance
to bury Juliette.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.587
There's more for you to see.

13:27.390 --> 13:28.892
This is one of
HW's command centers.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.228
There are more?
Oh, yeah.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.146
This is a war. It's happening
all over the world.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.902
And we're fighting it.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.238
Take a look at this.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.324
The hotspots are
Wesen uprisings.

13:41.404 --> 13:45.375
Brazil, Northern Ireland, Turkey,
Syria, Yemen, Pakistan, Ukraine.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.668
That's all Wesen-related?
All of it.

13:48.411 --> 13:51.039
There are people displaced all over the
world because of what they're doing.

13:51.122 --> 13:53.921
No one understands the real
reason behind any of it.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.252
Which is what?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.212
A world run by Wesen.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.387
Hitler tried once. Now Black
Claw is trying again.

14:08.890 --> 14:10.107
Let me show you something.

14:15.938 --> 14:16.939
What is this?

14:17.899 --> 14:19.651
It's our graveyard.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.361
Chavez is here.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.572
The ones you were supposed
to meet are here, too.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.406
So you cleaned it up.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.833
We had to.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.619
Why bring me here?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.206
Three days after
we took Juliette,

14:33.289 --> 14:35.462
we found where Kenneth
had dumped your mother's body.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.589
We recovered it,

14:38.711 --> 14:40.713
and what we took
from your house, and...

14:41.422 --> 14:43.220
And buried her here.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.188
Just in case you
don't believe me.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.817
We want your help.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.153
We need it for what's coming.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.436
Is he okay?

15:40.398 --> 15:41.775
He will be.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.007
It was swimming
all around us.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.959
We were gonna
go back to shore.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.259
What
stopped you?

16:01.335 --> 16:02.712
It hit our boat.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.010
Dragged my husband under.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.762
Something knocked
him into the water?

16:07.258 --> 16:09.511
You don't
understand. It attacked us.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.808
What attacked you?

16:12.054 --> 16:13.226
This.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.147
This is getting
so out of control.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.194
Calm down.
It's your fault.

16:19.270 --> 16:20.317
You're overreacting.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.524
A man is dead, Wayne,
and we're responsible.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.200
We're not responsible.
Logan is.

16:24.275 --> 16:27.950
Yeah, we hired Logan to scare
people, not to kill them.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.036
The whole thing backfired.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.618
You know what, we need to
close and get out of here.

16:34.744 --> 16:35.996
Be quiet.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.586
You guys rent the boats, right?
We sure do.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.838
Great. We need to get out
on that water right away.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.171
Just need you to
fill out these forms.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.007
No problem.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.762
You guys reporters?
Yeah.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.961
Guess you guys have heard
of the Diamond Lake Monster.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.911
Kind of a legend
around these parts.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.210
Word is that it
killed somebody.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.436
You here to cover it?

16:56.516 --> 16:57.813
"If it bleeds, it leads."

16:57.892 --> 16:59.769
Not that I believe in
monsters, but whatever.

16:59.936 --> 17:00.976
Hey, how much for the cap?

17:01.521 --> 17:03.364
It's $12.95..
15 bucks.

17:04.397 --> 17:05.758
I'll take one of
these shirts, too.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.323
You know, wouldn't it be great
if it was a monster,

17:08.402 --> 17:10.621
and not the usual
homicidal maniac?

17:13.281 --> 17:14.750
Rebecca,
you want one of these?

17:16.786 --> 17:18.959
Sure, why not? I'm a believer.

17:20.623 --> 17:23.384
I really hope
we get a chance to see this thing.

17:26.337 --> 17:27.805
You Okay?

17:28.256 --> 17:29.883
I don't even know
how to answer that.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.559
You talk to Meisner?

17:31.634 --> 17:32.635
Yeah.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.761
So, it's bad?

17:33.970 --> 17:36.393
We're at war,
and nobody knows it.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.105
In my office.
You need to see this.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.823
The Diamond Lake Monster,
fact or fiction?

17:46.065 --> 17:47.988
Early this
morning, Allan Eiger and his wife

17:48.067 --> 17:49.489
were out fishing
on Diamond Lake

17:49.569 --> 17:52.038
when he was confronted
by that very question.

17:52.113 --> 17:54.286
The answer cost him his life.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.705
Some locals claim
this gruesome attack

17:56.784 --> 17:59.583
is the work of the mysterious
Diamond Lake Monster.

17:59.662 --> 18:02.256
Could this be a local
legend come to life?

18:02.748 --> 18:06.343
The victim's wife took this
startling image during the attack.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.388
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.010
I got a call from
Sheriff Parcell.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.185
He knows you've had luck with
some of these strange cases.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.853
He requested
your help on this.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.521
Thinking this lake
monster is Wesen?

18:17.680 --> 18:20.103
I don't believe in monsters
unless they're people.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.855
And this one is
guilty of murder.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.026
We'll check it out.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.281
This is what
we're looking for?

18:27.356 --> 18:29.036
This is what
they're all looking for.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.160
Thanks
for coming.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.333
So, this is a cluster...
It is.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.962
I know you guys have dealt
with some pretty odd cases,

18:41.037 --> 18:42.334
and I thought
maybe you might be able

18:42.413 --> 18:43.665
to help us
figure this one out.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.091
What do we know?

18:45.166 --> 18:48.841
Allan and Elizabeth Eiger were on
the lake when something attacked.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.172
Allan had a gun
in his tackle box.

18:51.255 --> 18:54.054
He fired a few shots at it,
it rammed their boat.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.262
He got knocked overboard, and
this thing, whatever it was,

18:57.345 --> 18:59.018
pulled him under,
ripped the hell out of him.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.188
Wife saw the whole thing.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.390
And she took the photo?

19:01.474 --> 19:03.067
Yeah. She's over there.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.542
Do you think
it was a monster?

19:04.560 --> 19:05.903
I don't know
what to think.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.106
This lake monster's
just a local big fish story,

19:08.189 --> 19:10.988
like the Loch Ness
Monster or Ogopogo.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.911
Somebody shot a blurry photo
back in the '60s,

19:13.986 --> 19:15.283
started the whole legend.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.661
Has this legend
ever attacked anybody before?

19:17.740 --> 19:19.083
I checked the records.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.126
There were a half dozen sightings
over the last 40 years,

19:21.202 --> 19:22.829
but nobody was ever hurt.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.630
Working theory
is that somebody

19:24.747 --> 19:26.465
dumped a pet gator
that got too big.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.043
Fish and Game's out on the lake
looking for it with sonar.

19:29.543 --> 19:30.840
We'll talk to
the victim's wife.

19:32.713 --> 19:33.839
Mrs. Eiger?

19:34.423 --> 19:36.423
I'm Detective Griffin,
this is Detective Burkhardt.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.722
We'd like to ask
you a few questions

19:37.802 --> 19:39.349
about what
happened to your husband.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.601
I'm not sure what happened.

19:42.682 --> 19:46.437
We were out on the lake, and I saw
something swimming around us.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.734
We didn't know
what it was.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.947
Then it came out of the water.

19:51.607 --> 19:52.733
It was awful.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.656
We were both scared.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.618
Allan grabbed his gun
and shot at it, and...

19:59.448 --> 20:02.418
And it hit the boat and knocked
Allan into the water, and...

20:02.493 --> 20:05.918
Did you see anybody else on the
water before you saw what you saw?

20:06.706 --> 20:07.753
No.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.671
Were there any
other boats around?

20:09.959 --> 20:12.633
No,
we were out there all alone.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.965
I can't believe
he's gone.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.218
You rented
the boat from there?

20:18.300 --> 20:19.392
Yeah.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.471
Thank you for your time.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.309
I've got a theory.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.269
What?
She's Wesen.

20:28.436 --> 20:30.905
Kills her husband,
dumps the body overboard,

20:30.980 --> 20:34.610
blasts off a couple of rounds, blames
it on the Diamond Lake Monster.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.444
That doesn't explain
the photo she took.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.742
Well, somebody's Wesen.

20:39.822 --> 20:42.792
Don't mean to intrude.
I heard what happened.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.830
Just wanted to
say that I'm sorry.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.463
Thank you.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.303
The Lake Monster
sure isn't hurting business.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.440
All right, take care.

21:06.515 --> 21:10.190
Hey. I'm Detective Burkhardt,
this is Detective Griffin.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.521
We need to talk to you.

21:12.062 --> 21:13.063
Uh...

21:13.355 --> 21:15.574
We're
sort of a little busy.

21:15.733 --> 21:17.293
Well, you rented
the boat to the victim.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.153
We just have a few questions.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.780
Okay, okay, hold on.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.115
Just take over.

21:22.198 --> 21:23.199
Okay.

21:24.909 --> 21:28.129
What's your name? Wayne Dunbar.
That's my brother, Oliver.

21:29.205 --> 21:32.425
Look, we heard what happened. And
it's terrible. And we called 911.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.377
Did you or your
brother see anything

21:34.543 --> 21:36.420
unusual on
the lake this morning?

21:37.671 --> 21:39.844
Nothing out of the ordinary.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.142
Well, the Eigers took
the boat out about 7:30.

21:42.218 --> 21:44.095
About an hour later,

21:44.178 --> 21:47.148
we heard gunshots,
then we heard her screaming.

21:47.223 --> 21:50.022
We ran down to the water,
called 911.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.774
Our first thought was she
shot her husband.

21:52.937 --> 21:56.441
So you don't believe
in this lake monster?

21:57.608 --> 22:00.612
Well, we do sell a few items that
suggests that it does exist.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.321
But have I ever seen it? No.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.122
You have a pretty
brisk business here.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.038
A lot of gawkers
showed up after the attack,

22:07.159 --> 22:09.457
folks looking to get
a glimpse of the monster.

22:09.787 --> 22:13.007
It's pretty macabre,
but we appreciate the traffic.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.522
How long have you
owned the business?

22:16.418 --> 22:18.261
Parents opened it
about 50 years ago.

22:18.462 --> 22:20.089
Me and my brother took over
about five years ago,

22:20.172 --> 22:21.389
after they passed away.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.967
Your parents ever
see the monster?

22:24.552 --> 22:27.351
My dad swore that he did.
Twice.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.480
Yeah, he's the one that started
the whole hat and T-shirt thing.

22:31.559 --> 22:33.857
This is a picture that
he took of it right here.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.318
All my life,
I wanted to see this thing.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.983
Oh! I'm sorry.

22:40.276 --> 22:41.277
Oliver.

22:43.237 --> 22:45.456
Excuse me,
I got to help my brother.

22:52.246 --> 22:53.293
The brother's Wesen.

22:53.414 --> 22:54.414
What?

22:54.456 --> 22:57.881
The one who dropped the mug. He Woged
when he bent over to pick it up.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.052
Look anything like
the Lake Monster?

22:59.128 --> 23:00.220
No.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.298
I think he's
a Luisant-Pecheur,

23:02.381 --> 23:03.928
looks sort of
like an Eisbiber.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.635
You think they're involved?
I don't know.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.318
I mean, they sure are
benefiting from it.

23:07.428 --> 23:08.475
Better check them out.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.057
The turmeric should
help with your arthritis.

23:12.141 --> 23:14.189
If it doesn't make a difference,
you can bring it back.

23:14.268 --> 23:15.315
I'll try it.
Great.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.147
That'll be $17.25.
Let me get you some change.

23:20.900 --> 23:21.947
Okay.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.404
Thanks.
You're welcome.

23:33.662 --> 23:34.663
Hey.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.170
Oh, my God, Trubel!

23:37.917 --> 23:39.840
Oh! Nick told us you were back.

23:39.919 --> 23:40.966
Yeah.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.843
Sorry,
got to make this a group hug.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.009
How are you?

23:46.342 --> 23:47.719
Pretty good.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.144
How are you guys?
I missed you.

23:49.219 --> 23:51.221
We're just glad you're okay.

23:51.305 --> 23:53.273
So, you got a motorcycle.

23:53.682 --> 23:54.899
I did.

23:55.476 --> 23:58.355
Look, I need to talk to
you guys about something.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.280
Oh! That kind Of talk.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.987
You guys know about
Black Claw, right?

24:07.613 --> 24:08.739
We do.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.501
There's a lot more
you need to know.

24:14.078 --> 24:16.038
Neither of the Dunbar
brothers has a record.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.878
Well,
they're pretty deep in debt.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.300
Have some
trouble with the IRS.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.252
Owe some taxes,
a lien on their property.

24:22.336 --> 24:24.213
Good thing that monster
showed up when he did.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.548
But they
couldn't have done it.

24:27.675 --> 24:30.349
Whatever that is, it's
not what the brothers are.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.765
Maybe it was a Wesen for hire.

24:34.682 --> 24:37.231
We've got to figure out what kind
of Wesen we're dealing with.

24:41.063 --> 24:44.033
9 grand in one day. That's
got to be a record, right?

24:44.233 --> 24:45.576
Yeah, it's a record.

24:45.693 --> 24:46.990
I mean,
we've never sold out before.

24:47.069 --> 24:49.663
Everything's gone.
Hats, mugs, T-shirts.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.490
Even the triple
extra-large ones.

24:51.573 --> 24:53.246
I'm bursting
with joy.

24:53.742 --> 24:54.868
That's blood money, Wayne.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.166
Oh, come on.

24:56.245 --> 24:58.005
Dad would be proud.
That we got a man killed?

24:58.080 --> 24:59.423
It wasn't our fault.

24:59.540 --> 25:00.837
I just don't
think this is right.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.297
Then stop thinking.

25:02.376 --> 25:06.506
You know, Mom and Dad worked their
fingers to the bone for this place.

25:06.588 --> 25:08.010
If it was up to you,
we'd be out on the street.

25:08.215 --> 25:11.685
Yeah? Well, what about
if the cops find out about Logan?

25:11.760 --> 25:14.013
How are they gonna
find out about Logan?

25:15.264 --> 25:17.608
He was Woged. The witness
can't even connect him to it!

25:18.976 --> 25:20.649
You worry too much, brother.

25:20.728 --> 25:23.356
No, the only thing
you got to worry about

25:23.439 --> 25:25.612
is restocking these shelves.

25:27.276 --> 25:30.120
Where are you going? Laughing,
all the way to the bank.

25:35.451 --> 25:36.668
- Bring him another.
- You got it.

25:36.744 --> 25:37.961
Me, too.

25:41.457 --> 25:42.458
What do you want?

25:42.833 --> 25:44.176
I want you

25:45.044 --> 25:46.591
to do it again.

25:47.713 --> 25:48.965
Tonight.

25:50.090 --> 25:51.967
Wait. You remember?

25:52.051 --> 25:53.553
No? Come on.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.791
Do you want to
come swim with me?

25:57.056 --> 25:58.308
Oh, my gosh.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.363
We should ask him.

26:25.667 --> 26:26.839
Swim to me.

26:28.170 --> 26:29.170
No way.

26:29.213 --> 26:31.215
Are you afraid of
the Lake Monster?

26:31.298 --> 26:33.266
No, I'm not.
Yeah, you are.

26:34.176 --> 26:35.644
I dare you.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.934
What, don't you want
to be alone with me?

26:38.347 --> 26:39.974
Then get your butt out here.

26:46.188 --> 26:47.388
There's
something in the water.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.195
Too late.
I'm coming to get you.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.489
No, no! No, no, no. No.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.031
I'm not kidding, Kevin!

26:56.115 --> 26:57.708
What? Are you afraid the Lake
Monster's gonna get you?

26:57.783 --> 26:59.126
Oh, my God!
It's right in front of you!

26:59.201 --> 27:00.623
Come on in. The water's great.

27:05.374 --> 27:06.414
Get out of the water!

27:07.543 --> 27:08.886
Kevin, I'm serious.

27:09.378 --> 27:10.721
Kevin! Come on, please.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.931
Come here! Swim! Now!

27:14.550 --> 27:15.597
No!

27:25.894 --> 27:29.444
Rosalee's downstairs. We think we
found what you're looking for.

27:32.025 --> 27:36.952
We think it's a Wasser Zahne. It's like
a Skalengeck-y water-loving Wesen.

27:37.239 --> 27:39.287
Did you see it face-to-face?

27:39.408 --> 27:41.502
No, but we did see
a lot of T-shirts and hats.

27:41.577 --> 27:43.454
I got a couple of
Luisant-Pecheur brothers

27:43.579 --> 27:45.456
who might be working
with a Wasser Zahne.

27:45.581 --> 27:48.004
Killed a boater out on the lake.
Yeah, we saw the news.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.723
Looks like someone's rebooting the
old Diamond Lake Monster legend.

27:50.794 --> 27:53.923
And whoever he is,
that's probably our killer.

27:56.884 --> 27:59.854
Nick, when you went to
see Juliette... Eve.

28:00.679 --> 28:01.805
Eve? What?

28:02.306 --> 28:03.933
That's what she
calls herself now.

28:05.309 --> 28:07.277
Or it's what they call her,
I'm not really sure.

28:08.729 --> 28:09.946
Okay.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.285
Did you guys have
a chance to talk this time?

28:14.359 --> 28:17.954
She didn't seem that interested in talking.
She's not really Juliette.

28:18.655 --> 28:21.579
Whatever they did to her,
she's somebody else.

28:21.909 --> 28:23.456
God, this is terrible.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.121
I think... I mean,
if it was the old Juliette.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.645
Not the Juliette
that was responsible

28:27.706 --> 28:29.708
for killing your mother
and tried to kill you.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.919
Oh, my God, this so confusing.

28:32.002 --> 28:34.255
I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna stop talking.

28:34.463 --> 28:36.841
And also,
by the way, Trubel came by.

28:36.924 --> 28:39.393
She wanted to tell us where she's
been and what she's been doing,

28:39.468 --> 28:42.312
and she told us about these
people that she's working for.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.644
She said they'd
be contacting us.

28:44.723 --> 28:45.975
Are you going to help them?

28:47.059 --> 28:48.060
I don't know yet.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.396
Yeah, we're feeling
a little tentative ourselves.

28:50.479 --> 28:54.359
I think whatever we decide,
we all decide the same thing.

28:55.192 --> 28:57.160
We are in this together.

28:58.028 --> 28:59.075
Yeah.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.953
"This city
deserves safe streets,

29:02.032 --> 29:03.659
"and Andrew Dixon is committed
to supporting

29:03.742 --> 29:05.460
"the hardworking
police officers

29:05.577 --> 29:07.250
"that keep our
neighborhoods secure.

29:07.329 --> 29:11.300
"That's why I'm here to endorse
Andrew Dixon for Mayor."

29:13.168 --> 29:14.169
How's that?

29:15.003 --> 29:16.255
Can I make a suggestion?

29:16.755 --> 29:17.756
Of course.

29:17.839 --> 29:20.888
Instead of saying "this
city" try saying "we."

29:20.968 --> 29:23.312
"We deserve safe streets."

29:23.387 --> 29:26.015
It'll be easier for
the voters to get behind you

29:26.098 --> 29:28.138
if you make it clear you're
part of their community.

29:29.059 --> 29:30.151
Okay.

29:30.477 --> 29:31.854
Want to run it
again from the top?

29:32.646 --> 29:34.023
Sure.
Okay.

29:41.863 --> 29:46.084
I think we're gonna need
to run it more than once.

29:51.248 --> 29:54.673
This is getting out of hand. My
lakeshore's turning into a circus.

29:54.751 --> 29:58.051
I've got nuts out on boats
threatening to shoot this thing.

29:58.797 --> 29:59.844
According to
the kids with him,

29:59.923 --> 30:02.096
he was swimming when the thing
came right out of the water,

30:02.175 --> 30:03.552
grabbed him,
dragged him under.

30:04.011 --> 30:05.308
I wouldn't
let them move the body

30:05.387 --> 30:07.139
till you guys had
a chance to see it.

30:07.222 --> 30:10.522
As far as I know, there
are no freshwater sharks.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.193
I'm hoping you
guys have some ideas

30:12.311 --> 30:13.904
'cause I'm at
a loss on this one.

30:14.229 --> 30:15.509
Yeah,
we're working on something.

30:15.564 --> 30:18.204
Hey, Sheriff. I
got something I want to show you.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.409
We need to squeeze
the Dunbar brothers.

30:23.488 --> 30:24.535
How?

30:24.614 --> 30:27.214
Until we know who the Wasser Zahne
is, we can't make a connection.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.832
And we can't take a Wesen to court.
It's the perfect scam.

30:29.911 --> 30:30.912
We need to scare them.

30:31.121 --> 30:32.589
By letting them
know you're a Grimm?

30:32.706 --> 30:33.923
Not me.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.879
They need to think
they're getting away with it.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.357
Here you go.

30:50.432 --> 30:51.684
Thank you. Come again.

30:51.808 --> 30:53.060
Thanks.

30:55.812 --> 30:58.907
$24 for a T-shirt,
15 bucks for a mug?

30:59.608 --> 31:00.700
We need to talk.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.949
Wayne? Wayne.

31:03.445 --> 31:05.914
All right, I'll handle it.
Let's talk in the office.

31:15.791 --> 31:16.883
Keep going.
Okay.

31:19.795 --> 31:20.887
You shouldn't be
coming around here...

31:20.962 --> 31:23.681
I want half, of everything,
starting yesterday.

31:23.757 --> 31:24.758
What?

31:24.841 --> 31:26.468
You wouldn't have any of this
if it wasn't for me.

31:26.551 --> 31:29.054
I can pay you more. I can give
you a couple hundred right now.

31:29.137 --> 31:31.981
You don't get it. You've
been taking advantage of me.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.857
I do all the work,
you two make all the money.

31:34.976 --> 31:36.569
Well, sure, yeah,
we can work something out.

31:36.645 --> 31:38.989
I'll be back at
midnight to collect the rest.

31:39.064 --> 31:42.659
If I don't get it, they'll be pulling
your bodies out of the lake.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.172
What's for dinner?

32:01.753 --> 32:03.005
Not sure.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.426
I don't think he's ready.

32:07.509 --> 32:09.182
Burkhardt?
He's still too emotional.

32:10.345 --> 32:13.724
He doesn't understand how important
you are to us, the way you are now.

32:13.807 --> 32:15.650
Maybe you should
have changed my face.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.565
Or do to him
what you did to me.

32:18.103 --> 32:22.404
He'll come around once he
realizes what we're up against.

32:29.698 --> 32:31.041
It's chicken.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.452
I don't like it. I mean,
I don't trust this guy.

32:33.577 --> 32:35.295
He's already
killed two people.

32:35.370 --> 32:38.169
And what would make him go out
and kill that poor kid?

32:38.248 --> 32:40.751
I don't know. I mean, he's
obviously out of his mind.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.802
But if he keeps giving us
trouble, we gotta deal with it.

32:42.878 --> 32:43.925
Okay, okay.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.976
Wait, Wayne.
Wayne. No. No. No!

32:50.051 --> 32:51.411
Listen,
here's what we're gonna do.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.793
When he comes back tonight,
he's gonna ask for his money.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.173
And we're gonna
give it to him.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.234
And just let him walk out?

32:58.393 --> 33:01.488
No. As soon as you give him the
money, I'm gonna shoot him.

33:01.563 --> 33:02.563
What?

33:02.606 --> 33:04.825
It's obvious.
He came here to rob us.

33:04.900 --> 33:08.074
He had the gun, we struggled
over it and he got shot.

33:09.863 --> 33:13.413
Okay. This whole
thing is out of control.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.244
I think we should
just give him the money.

33:19.039 --> 33:20.461
Sorry, we're closed!

33:20.540 --> 33:21.632
Open the door.

33:26.588 --> 33:27.840
It's a girl.

33:27.923 --> 33:29.971
I'm not here to
buy any of your crap.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.436
I'm looking for
the Wasser Zahne.

33:32.511 --> 33:33.512
Wayne...

33:33.762 --> 33:35.514
Open the door!
Okay, okay.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.022
We don't know what you're talking about.
Can you just go away?

33:40.101 --> 33:41.603
Yeah, that's him.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.439
Doesn't look much
like that, does he?

33:44.731 --> 33:46.699
I guess people
just buy anything.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.114
Stop being stupid.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.821
I'm not looking for
any Luisant-Pecheur,

33:50.946 --> 33:52.619
I'm looking for
the Wasser Zahne.

33:53.907 --> 33:56.581
There's a contract on his head,
and I'm going to collect.

33:58.453 --> 33:59.500
Oh, my God, she's a Grimm.

34:04.167 --> 34:05.635
What do you think
you're gonna do with this?

34:05.710 --> 34:07.337
Nothing, I mean, nothing.

34:08.295 --> 34:09.797
Thank God you're here.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.429
The Wasser Zahne's
name is Logan Cobb.

34:12.801 --> 34:13.927
He set us up.

34:14.010 --> 34:17.059
He came up with the idea of
bringing back the Lake Monster.

34:17.138 --> 34:19.982
He attacked those innocent
people on his own.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.856
If we don't sell this stuff,
he's gonna kill us.

34:21.935 --> 34:24.609
We're just patsies selling trinkets.
He's taking all the money.

34:25.272 --> 34:26.569
Where do I find him?

34:26.898 --> 34:29.868
He's coming back here at
midnight to pick up his money.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.822
But if you get rid of him,
we'll give it to you.

34:31.860 --> 34:33.362
And you can still
collect on his head.

34:33.655 --> 34:34.695
It's a win-win.

34:34.864 --> 34:37.492
He's an old drunk. Should
be no problem for a Grimm.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.498
Yeah. Yeah.
Midnight, huh?

34:39.828 --> 34:42.047
Yeah, but you got
to be here earlier.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.210
I'll come back at 11:30.

34:46.626 --> 34:49.129
Logan better show.

35:00.181 --> 35:01.558
This is perfect.

35:02.309 --> 35:03.936
Perfect?
She's a freaking Grimm!

35:04.019 --> 35:05.692
Yeah,
just what we need.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.840
Well, you were right.

35:29.044 --> 35:31.763
The brothers are working with a
Wasser Zahne named Logan Cobb.

35:32.422 --> 35:35.392
He's been doing the killing,
they've been collecting the profits.

35:35.592 --> 35:37.515
But they claim Logan's
taking all the money.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.812
He's coming back at
midnight to collect.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.135
How do you want to do this?

35:41.181 --> 35:42.273
Carefully.

35:42.349 --> 35:44.669
This guy's got a violent record
and lot of assault charges.

35:44.893 --> 35:46.236
Now
he's killed two people.

35:47.729 --> 35:49.527
What time do they
expect you to be there?

35:49.814 --> 35:50.861
Told them 11:30.

35:50.940 --> 35:52.988
So I guess we'll have to crash
the party a little early.

35:53.068 --> 35:55.116
How far do you
want me to take this?

35:55.195 --> 35:56.913
Well,
he's murdered two people,

35:57.072 --> 35:58.824
and we can't
arrest him for it.

35:59.908 --> 36:01.330
That's all I need to know.

36:15.256 --> 36:16.929
You bring me my money?

36:17.092 --> 36:18.810
No. It's not midnight.

36:19.302 --> 36:20.554
Look,
you're coming to my place.

36:20.637 --> 36:21.934
I'm not gonna walk around
with that much cash.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.765
Then what are you doing here?

36:24.849 --> 36:26.021
I'm here to warn you.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.359
About what?

36:27.435 --> 36:28.652
My brother, Oliver.

36:29.104 --> 36:30.947
He's gonna double-cross you.

36:31.815 --> 36:32.816
What?

36:32.899 --> 36:34.526
He said he wanted
to keep your share,

36:34.609 --> 36:37.328
so he hired somebody to kill
you when you show up tonight.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.078
That little bastard.

36:41.491 --> 36:43.459
I'll kill him.
No. No, no, no.

36:43.535 --> 36:44.536
I got a plan.

36:44.994 --> 36:46.041
Yeah? What?

36:46.705 --> 36:48.298
You kill Oliver.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.593
You want me to
kill your brother?

36:51.751 --> 36:54.595
Oliver never believed
in you, not like I do.

36:54.671 --> 36:56.765
I can’t just stand by,
after everything you've done,

36:56.840 --> 36:58.000
and let him get away with it.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.145
So, what's this plan of yours?

37:04.305 --> 37:06.524
Oliver doesn't
expect you until midnight.

37:06.725 --> 37:10.150
But the person he hired comes
at 11:30, so you come at 11:00.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.990
First,
you take care of Oliver.

37:14.899 --> 37:17.243
And then, we take care of
his assassin, together.

37:19.988 --> 37:22.662
So,
who'd Oliver hire to kill me?

37:24.159 --> 37:25.502
Some girl.

37:27.287 --> 37:28.287
A girl?

37:28.329 --> 37:29.376
Yeah, yeah.

37:29.456 --> 37:30.958
He thinks you'd
never expect it.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.337
Well, this'll be easy.

37:35.545 --> 37:37.172
What do we do with the bodies?

37:38.339 --> 37:39.556
We dump them in the lake.

37:40.175 --> 37:44.180
We blame everything
on the Diamond Lake Monster.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.482
- You mean, me?
- No!

37:48.641 --> 37:50.359
Come on, keep your voice down.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.278
Look, this one.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.399
Yeah, that one.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.584
I see Logan.

38:12.749 --> 38:14.626
I guess he couldn't
wait till midnight.

38:14.709 --> 38:16.086
Something else
is going on here.

38:16.377 --> 38:18.175
Could be he
doesn't trust them.

38:19.214 --> 38:20.887
You ready?
Yeah.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.719
What if she's late, okay?

38:24.803 --> 38:27.056
What if she shows
up after he does?

38:27.138 --> 38:28.498
What if she
doesn't show up at all?

38:29.682 --> 38:30.683
Who?

38:31.392 --> 38:33.394
Who what?
Who you were talking about.

38:33.603 --> 38:34.900
Oh, uh...

38:35.146 --> 38:37.365
No. That was
something else altogether.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.317
Hey, look at all
the money we got for you.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.653
I know all about your plan.

38:41.736 --> 38:43.488
Plan? What plan?

38:43.571 --> 38:45.164
To backstab me.
What?

38:45.240 --> 38:47.038
And take my share.

38:47.575 --> 38:48.827
Hey, I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:48.910 --> 38:51.584
The little girl
you hired to kill me.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.833
I didn’t hire
a little girl to kill you.

38:54.916 --> 38:56.476
Well, that's not
what your brother said.

38:56.918 --> 38:58.010
What?

38:58.878 --> 39:00.972
I told him the truth, Oliver.
I had to.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.640
What truth is that, Wayne?

39:04.008 --> 39:05.601
I couldn't let you betray him.

39:05.677 --> 39:08.772
Betray Logan? I didn't betray...
I didn't betray...

39:09.180 --> 39:10.602
No!

39:11.099 --> 39:14.524
Okay, Logan, I...
I didn't do anything.

39:14.602 --> 39:16.275
You're gonna taste good.

39:16.354 --> 39:19.073
No, no, no!
Wayne, tell him! No! Wayne!

39:19.274 --> 39:20.901
- Wayne! Wayne!
- Hey!

39:24.946 --> 39:26.118
You're early.

39:27.991 --> 39:31.336
So, you're the little
girl he hired to kill me?

39:31.411 --> 39:34.130
I didn't hire her, Wayne did.
Okay?

39:34.205 --> 39:37.209
Wayne did everything. I didn't
even want to do any of this.

39:37.292 --> 39:38.589
Whatever.

39:44.132 --> 39:46.260
You didn't tell
me she was a Grimm.

39:46.759 --> 39:47.976
Oops.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.829
Wow!

40:13.077 --> 40:14.169
You're really good.

40:15.538 --> 40:16.915
Here you go.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.301
I'll double it if
you kill my brother.

40:21.836 --> 40:23.008
Oh, come on, Wayne!

40:23.171 --> 40:24.297
The killing's over.

40:24.964 --> 40:26.966
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We saw it all.
She killed him.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.226
Didn't really have a choice.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.308
He killed two people.
We couldn't arrest him.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.936
Yeah, I guess you should know.
He's a Grimm, just like her.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.233
It's locked. He's just gonna
go out the back door.

40:44.359 --> 40:45.406
You should go around.

40:46.027 --> 40:47.153
Stay with him.

41:05.713 --> 41:07.306
There's no way I'm
going in there after him.

41:07.423 --> 41:09.050
He's got to come
out sooner or later.

41:09.092 --> 41:10.810
I see him!
Yeah, it's right there!

41:10.885 --> 41:12.182
- You see him yet?
- It's the monster.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.067
How are we gonna
explain this one?

41:27.735 --> 41:29.737
Why was this idiot
swimming in the lake at night

41:29.821 --> 41:31.823
with all that's going on?

41:32.031 --> 41:33.783
No wonder he got himself shot.

41:35.243 --> 41:37.587
Maybe he wanted to make people
think he was the monster.

41:38.246 --> 41:39.766
Drum up a little
business for the shop?

41:41.165 --> 41:43.259
Maybe that's what he and his
brother were doing all along.

41:43.584 --> 41:46.007
Yeah. Maybe.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.645
But how'd this local drunk wind up
in the water with a broken neck?

41:49.716 --> 41:51.093
I don't know.

41:51.467 --> 41:54.016
I'm starting to think this
Diamond Lake Monster is real.

41:56.472 --> 41:57.564
Is he serious?

41:58.683 --> 42:00.026
You never know.

42:02.770 --> 42:04.898
Guess it's better to believe in
a monster than know the truth.

42:04.981 --> 42:08.110
Yeah, 'cause you can always convince
yourself a monster's not real.

42:08.276 --> 42:10.825
Reality is definitely
not what it used to be.
