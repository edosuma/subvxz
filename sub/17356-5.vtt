00:07.508 --> 00:09.375
- ¶

00:09.377 --> 00:11.276
- Hey, guys, I made
fresh brownies!

00:11.278 --> 00:13.445
- NORA: Yay, brownies!
- BILLY: All right, Phoebe!

00:13.447 --> 00:17.249
- MAX: I take back everything
I ever said about you, Phoebe.

00:18.452 --> 00:19.618
No brownies?

00:19.620 --> 00:22.254
I take back the take back.

00:22.456 --> 00:25.324
- "Surprise!
You're at a family meeting."

00:25.326 --> 00:27.659
It's a trap!
- [powers whooshing]

00:27.661 --> 00:29.528
Hey! Nobody leaves.
[rapping gavel]

00:29.530 --> 00:31.196
I'm calling this
family meeting to order.

00:31.198 --> 00:35.167
- Oh, man, she pinned us in.
Now we can't leave.

00:35.169 --> 00:38.337
- Okay, guys, Mom and Dad's
20th anniversary is coming up--

00:38.339 --> 00:40.406
which means we need
to decide on a gift.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.473
- Let's just make
'em something.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.743
They love this piece of garbage
Chloe made for 'em.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.078
- Hey!

00:46.080 --> 00:49.148
I made this vase.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.516
- Gift idea--

00:50.518 --> 00:53.485
we take your vase
outside and smash it!

00:53.487 --> 00:55.454
- Don't worry, Max, we will
take care of the gift

00:55.456 --> 00:57.823
and sign your name to
the card--like always.

00:57.825 --> 00:58.624
- Oh, thanks.

00:58.626 --> 01:00.359
I take back the take
back I took back.

01:00.361 --> 01:01.360
- PHOEBE:
Oh.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.328
- Hey, why don't
we have Mom and Dad's

01:03.330 --> 01:05.097
original wedding
photo framed?

01:05.099 --> 01:05.798
- Great idea, Nora.

01:05.800 --> 01:09.201
Old people love looking at
themselves when they were young.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.571
- You know, actually,
I've never really seen

01:12.573 --> 01:13.639
their wedding photo.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.774
[gasps] Maybe they're
not really married.

01:15.776 --> 01:20.079
- Oh, no! That means
we don't exist!

01:20.081 --> 01:23.382
- Did I hear something
about brownies?

01:23.384 --> 01:24.116
Ah, it's a trap!

01:24.118 --> 01:25.317
- PHOEBE: Hey!
[rapping gavel]

01:25.319 --> 01:27.820
- Oh, man, she banged the thing.
Now we can't leave.

01:27.822 --> 01:31.623
- We were just discussing
your anniversary gift.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.258
- Oh, what brought that up?

01:33.260 --> 01:36.662
Oh! Oh! The...the fact that
it's coming up this...

01:36.664 --> 01:39.298
let's see, first there's Spring,
and then there's Summer...

01:39.300 --> 01:42.601
- BARB: Saturday.
- Saturday! That's it!

01:42.603 --> 01:44.236
- Uh, we were wondering
if we could

01:44.238 --> 01:46.105
see some of
your wedding pictures.

01:46.107 --> 01:48.707
- Uh, we don't
really have any.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.676
- Ha! I knew
they weren't married.

01:50.678 --> 01:51.810
- Are we even your kids?

01:51.812 --> 01:54.346
- Don't be ridiculous.
Of course, we're married.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.581
- Then what about
your wedding?

01:55.583 --> 01:57.883
- Well, yeah, we don't really
like to talk about it.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.552
- It was 20 years
ago in Metroburg

02:00.554 --> 02:02.354
when I was melting
your mom's heart

02:02.356 --> 02:04.690
with the wedding
vows I wrote...

02:04.692 --> 02:09.361
Barb, you are
the lightning to my thunder,

02:09.363 --> 02:10.629
the wind beneath my cape,

02:10.631 --> 02:13.699
[voice cracking]
the meat in my sandwich.

02:13.701 --> 02:17.302
That's why I wrote
you this song.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.671
¶ Beautiful Bar-bar-a ¶

02:19.673 --> 02:21.907
¶ I really
love her, yeah ¶

02:21.909 --> 02:25.878
- Ugh, no wonder you guys don't
like talking about your wedding.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.614
- Hey, let me finish.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.916
¶ Beautiful Bar-bar-a ¶

02:30.918 --> 02:35.420
¶ Sha la la la
la-a-a-a-a-a! ¶

02:35.422 --> 02:40.459
- Now--
- ¶ Sha la la la la ¶

02:43.164 --> 02:44.463
Now you may continue.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.165
- Now, do you,
Hank Thunderman,

02:46.167 --> 02:50.669
take Barbara McBooger
to be your Superwife?

02:50.671 --> 02:52.337
- I do.
- Oh.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.305
- COLOSSO:
I don't!

02:53.307 --> 02:54.873
Don't anybody move!
- ALL: [gasping]

02:54.875 --> 02:56.375
- COLOSSO:
[evil laughter]

02:56.377 --> 02:57.709
- Colosso,
why are you here?

02:57.711 --> 03:00.879
- Because I swore I'd never
let you have a wedding day

03:00.881 --> 03:02.514
after you ruined mine.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.716
- You broke into
the White House,

03:04.718 --> 03:05.484
wedgied the president,

03:05.486 --> 03:08.320
and tried to get married
in the Oval Office.

03:08.322 --> 03:11.390
- I wanted it to be fancy.

03:11.392 --> 03:15.260
We're not all rich
like the McBoogers.

03:15.262 --> 03:16.628
- Can you, uh, hurry
up and marry us

03:16.630 --> 03:19.364
so I don't have to go
by that name anymore.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.501
- I now pronounced you
husband and wife.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.503
- COLOSSO:
Don't kiss her!

03:24.505 --> 03:29.508
Behold! The gadget that turns
people into animals.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.509
- ALL:
[gasping]

03:30.511 --> 03:34.746
- The people-to-animals
switcherooni ray.

03:34.748 --> 03:38.350
- I would just call
it the animalizer.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.351
- That's dumb.

03:39.353 --> 03:44.256
With this animalizer,
I plan to ruin your wedding.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.891
- Whoa, relax, everyone.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.760
His inventions never work.

03:48.762 --> 03:52.664
- [ray zapping]

03:52.900 --> 03:54.833
- HANK:
See? Didn't work.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.535
- BARB:
Hank, we're goats.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.370
- HANK:
[bleating]

03:58.372 --> 03:59.271
- Congratulations.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.406
I did get you
a little something.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.376
- HANK: [bleating]
- It's a toaster.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.478
What? I'm not a monster.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.413
Hmmm!
[laughing]

04:08.415 --> 04:10.782
A monster!
[laughing]

04:10.784 --> 04:12.584
- HANK:
[bleating]

04:12.586 --> 04:15.621
- I can't believe Colosso
never told me that story.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.623
It's hilarious.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.392
Well, you know it is.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.927
- Okay, so,
what happened next?

04:21.929 --> 04:24.696
- Well, the Hero League found
a way to turn us back.

04:24.698 --> 04:28.667
- Although, not before
I ate my own veil.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.535
- And then we hunted
down Dr. Colosso

04:30.537 --> 04:32.804
and used his weapon
against him--

04:32.806 --> 04:33.972
turning him into
the rude bunny

04:33.974 --> 04:37.276
that lives in our
house for some reason.

04:37.278 --> 04:40.279
- He's payin'
for his crime.

04:40.281 --> 04:41.413
- Is he?
'Cause I'm the one

04:41.415 --> 04:43.849
who has to scoop
up his poop pellets.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.817
- Well, this has
been fun, but, uh,

04:45.819 --> 04:46.985
I need to head
down to the mall.

04:46.987 --> 04:50.455
Not because I need
any last-minute gifts.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.156
- I'll go with you,

04:51.158 --> 04:54.493
but not because I need to show
you exactly what I want.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.598
- Guys, I have
the best gift idea.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.534
- You're moving out?

05:02.536 --> 05:03.201
- No.
[sighs]

05:03.203 --> 05:05.337
Since Mom and Dad's first
wedding got destroyed,

05:05.339 --> 05:06.471
let's throw
them another one.

05:06.473 --> 05:10.442
- Great--as long as it means
these meetings can stop.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.010
- Fine. We will
schedule a meeting

05:12.012 --> 05:14.479
to discuss cancelling
future meetings.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.349
There'll be brownies.
- BILLY: Really?

05:17.351 --> 05:19.484
- No.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.520
- ¶

05:21.522 --> 05:22.621
¶ What you see ¶

05:22.623 --> 05:23.822
¶ Is not what you get ¶

05:23.824 --> 05:27.492
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

05:27.494 --> 05:28.960
¶ We fit right in ¶

05:28.962 --> 05:30.395
¶ Bet you never guessed ¶

05:30.397 --> 05:31.930
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

05:31.932 --> 05:33.632
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

05:33.634 --> 05:35.500
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

05:35.502 --> 05:37.469
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

05:37.471 --> 05:38.770
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

05:38.772 --> 05:40.505
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

05:40.507 --> 05:42.374
¶ This isn't
make believe ¶

05:42.376 --> 05:43.809
¶ It's our reality ¶

05:43.811 --> 05:44.910
¶ Just your average family ¶

05:44.912 --> 05:48.547
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

05:48.549 --> 05:52.818
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

05:55.122 --> 05:57.689
- BARB & HANK:
Happy Anniversary!

05:57.691 --> 06:02.127
- Ooh, I have a feeling
this is a neck massager.

06:02.129 --> 06:05.097
- I have a feeling
this is a handbag.

06:05.099 --> 06:08.900
- BARB: A neck massager?
- HANK: A neck massager!

06:08.902 --> 06:11.570
- What happened
to the handbag?

06:11.572 --> 06:12.304
- Ooh, you look tense.

06:12.306 --> 06:15.240
You should put
that on right now.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.577
- Special delivery.
- BARB: Oh!

06:18.579 --> 06:22.614
- All right. About time one
of these kids got a job.

06:22.616 --> 06:25.817
- Oh, Hank, the kids are
throwing us a wedding

06:25.819 --> 06:28.120
as an anniversary gift.

06:28.122 --> 06:30.756
- PHOEBE:
That's right.

06:30.758 --> 06:33.825
- Can I have
my brownie now?

06:33.827 --> 06:35.994
- Why does she
get a real brownie?

06:35.996 --> 06:39.965
- Because she doesn't complain
about the meetings.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.033
- "The Thunderman kids
request your presence

06:42.035 --> 06:45.771
at the marriage of Hank and Barb
Thunderman this evening."

06:45.773 --> 06:46.972
- Oh, kids,
that is so sweet.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.841
- Hey, we want you guys to have
the wedding of your dreams.

06:49.843 --> 06:50.609
- Hank:
Aww...

06:50.611 --> 06:54.112
- It'll be the most romantic
event of the century.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.113
- Hm, settle down.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.616
It's in the driveway
by the garbage cans.

06:57.618 --> 07:00.018
- Oh, I can't believe
we're having a wedding.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.621
I'm gonna need a new dress,
a new tux.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.221
- Oh, not me.

07:03.223 --> 07:06.057
I still have my Thunder Tux
from our first wedding.

07:06.059 --> 07:09.995
It will fit me
like a glove.

07:09.997 --> 07:10.829
- Are you sure?

07:10.831 --> 07:13.665
'Cause you haven't tried
on that glove in a while.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.133
- Please,
one quick workout,

07:15.135 --> 07:17.769
and I'll get my wedding
bod back in no time.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.172
So, you can just relax.
- No, I--

07:20.174 --> 07:22.040
- [neck massager vibrating]
- Oh, right.

07:22.042 --> 07:25.143
This is much better
than a handbag.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.312
- Okay, guys, we've
got a lot of work to do.

07:27.314 --> 07:29.648
First, we'll need
a wedding theme.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.383
- One word--bows!

07:31.385 --> 07:35.053
- Better word--fire!

07:35.055 --> 07:35.787
- Or robots.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.323
- Or robots
that breathe fire.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.292
I know a guy.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.726
- Uh, guys, guys, um...

07:41.728 --> 07:43.061
it's so awesome
that you wanna help,

07:43.063 --> 07:45.197
and I already have
the perfect job for you.

07:45.199 --> 07:48.333
- I'll take it,
but I need today off.

07:48.335 --> 07:49.868
I have a wedding.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.803
- All you need to do is
keep Colosso in the lair

07:51.805 --> 07:54.039
and make sure he doesn't find
out about the wedding.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.841
- All right.
You heard her, Billy.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.809
You watch Colosso,
I take a nap.

07:57.811 --> 08:01.780
- That's not what she said.
- MAX: It's what I heard.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.319
- Three, four, five, six.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.254
Cool, I landed
on the carrot patch.

08:09.256 --> 08:13.358
- Ooh, but ya got
stuck in farm jail.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.360
- Can I pay my way out
with Colosso bucks?

08:15.362 --> 08:18.830
- No, because the farmer ran
you over with his tractor--

08:18.832 --> 08:21.066
which means I win again!

08:21.068 --> 08:23.668
- How do you win every
game of Farmageddon?

08:23.670 --> 08:27.439
- I'm asleep and even
I know he's cheating.

08:27.441 --> 08:28.373
- I don't care.

08:28.375 --> 08:31.109
This is the best secret
job I've ever had.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.378
- Secret? What secret?

08:33.380 --> 08:34.746
- Stop talking, Billy.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.114
- Tell me what's goin' on--

08:36.116 --> 08:39.985
and a million Colosso
bucks can be yours.

08:39.987 --> 08:43.188
- I'll be richer
than a McBooger.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.122
- Billy, don't.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.457
- We're supposed to
keep you distracted

08:45.459 --> 08:47.993
so you don't ruin Mom
and Dad's second wedding.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.695
- Second wedding?!

08:50.697 --> 08:51.263
- Good job.

08:51.265 --> 08:53.732
You just bought yourself
a lifetime of Phoebe meetings.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.901
- Why are they
having another wedding?

08:55.903 --> 08:58.803
I worked so hard
to destroy the first one.

08:58.805 --> 08:59.437
- Yeah, we heard.

08:59.439 --> 09:02.807
By the way,
the goats were hilarious.

09:02.809 --> 09:05.143
- I don't think
they were.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.379
I regret what I did.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.180
- You actually feel bad?

09:09.182 --> 09:10.115
- Yes.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.284
Now that I've seen the love
between your parents,

09:12.286 --> 09:17.155
I wish I hadn't
ruined their special day.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.157
[suppressed sobs]

09:19.159 --> 09:20.425
- Are you...crying?

09:20.427 --> 09:24.162
- I just wish I could go
back and fix my mistake

09:24.164 --> 09:27.432
with a year-
switcherooni ray.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.000
- You mean a time machine?

09:29.002 --> 09:30.769
- That's a much better name.

09:30.771 --> 09:33.238
Well, I'm sure
the wedding will be great--

09:33.240 --> 09:36.308
especially since Phoebe
has Max down here.

09:36.310 --> 09:38.043
- What's that
supposed to mean?

09:38.045 --> 09:40.145
- You're stuck here
guarding a bunny.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.780
Maybe Phoebe's more
worried about

09:41.782 --> 09:43.214
you ruining the wedding.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.050
- Oh, that's ridiculous.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.451
Phoebe's not keeping
me down here.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.353
I can go up
whenever I want.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.921
- Wait, are you going up--

09:49.923 --> 09:52.757
because I'm supposed
to tell Phoebe.

09:52.759 --> 09:53.358
- What?

09:53.360 --> 09:55.026
She has you watching me?

09:55.028 --> 09:55.493
- No.

09:55.495 --> 09:58.930
She has me watching you.
- I just said that.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.167
And Phoebe's wrong.
I don't ruin things.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.468
I make things awesome.

10:03.470 --> 10:04.402
- Yeah, you should
get up there

10:04.404 --> 10:07.272
and give Hank and Barb
the best wedding ever--

10:07.274 --> 10:09.808
because they
deserve happiness.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.810
- Yeah, come on,
let's go, Billy.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.078
- Uh, I'm rich now, Max.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.914
Call me "Billy McBooger."

10:18.852 --> 10:19.884
- So, you see, Chloe,

10:19.886 --> 10:22.420
some people have to
do months of exercise

10:22.422 --> 10:23.788
to get their wedding bod,

10:23.790 --> 10:28.360
but all Thunder Man needs to
do is a single push-up.

10:28.362 --> 10:29.995
[grunts]

10:29.997 --> 10:31.997
Ha-ha!

10:31.999 --> 10:35.200
- It didn't work.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.202
- Well, that's funny.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.104
It must've made
some difference.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.039
I bet I can fit
into my jacket.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.974
[clears throat]

10:48.982 --> 10:51.516
[straining, sobbing]

10:52.219 --> 10:54.119
[sighs]

10:54.121 --> 10:56.154
Like a glove.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.856
- [button ricocheting]

10:57.858 --> 10:59.858
- [vase shatters]

10:59.860 --> 11:03.061
- Yay, your belly
broke Phoebe's vase.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.131
- This is bad.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.233
It's not a Thunder Man
wedding without a Thunder Tux.

11:08.235 --> 11:11.503
How am I gonna get a wedding
bod in just a few hours?

11:12.372 --> 11:15.473
- With boot camp, baby!

11:15.475 --> 11:17.275
- I don't think
this is a good ide--

11:17.277 --> 11:18.476
- [whistle shrills]

11:18.478 --> 11:20.578
- Stop yapping
and give me 20.

11:20.580 --> 11:21.312
- Twenty?

11:21.314 --> 11:24.149
- You're lucky
I can't count higher.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.884
One, two, three...

11:25.886 --> 11:29.554
- Well, it'll be pretty
obvious who decorated this.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.990
I can't believe you
used all your bows.

11:31.992 --> 11:35.193
- You think this
is all my bows?

11:35.195 --> 11:38.129
- Oh, hey, this wedding
is gonna be so elegant.

11:38.131 --> 11:42.233
- Let's get this
wedding started!

11:42.235 --> 11:45.537
- [dance music]

11:46.039 --> 11:48.440
- Max, what are you doing?

11:48.442 --> 11:50.542
- I'm Maxifying
this wedding!

11:50.544 --> 11:52.444
- Billy, you're supposed
to be watching him.

11:52.446 --> 11:55.647
- I am. I'm watching
him Maxify this wedding.

11:55.649 --> 12:00.952
- I give you the mashed
potato bar!

12:00.954 --> 12:03.955
- BILLY:
It's got fixing's, yo!

12:04.424 --> 12:10.061
- And what's a wedding
without bub-bubbles!

12:10.063 --> 12:13.298
- We're both like, what?!

12:13.300 --> 12:16.334
- This is exactly what
I was afraid of, Max.

12:16.336 --> 12:17.936
You always ruin
everything.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.437
- So, Colosso was right.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.473
- Colosso?
Colosso, wait!

12:21.475 --> 12:22.540
If you guys are up here,

12:22.542 --> 12:24.342
then who's downstairs
watching him?

12:24.344 --> 12:26.211
- Don't worry
about Colosso.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.445
He's happy about
the wedding.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.947
- You told him
about the wedding?

12:28.949 --> 12:31.216
- Yeah, he regrets
what happened and said

12:31.218 --> 12:33.618
Mom and Dad
deserve happiness.

12:33.620 --> 12:37.155
Oh, no.
- Oh, yes!

12:38.358 --> 12:39.491
I'm here to renew my vows

12:39.493 --> 12:43.228
to always destroy
Thunder Man's wedding.

12:43.230 --> 12:46.531
[evil laughter]

12:46.533 --> 12:49.334
- [sighs]
He's gone.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.468
- This is bad.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.504
- Colosso's on
the loose, yo!

12:52.506 --> 12:55.540
- [rays zapping]
- [mic drops]

12:59.079 --> 13:00.779
- Okay, we're running
out of time

13:00.781 --> 13:03.381
to find Colosso
before the wedding.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.184
- Aha!
- You found him?

13:06.186 --> 13:09.187
- No, I found
the TV remote.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.422
Welcome home, old friend.

13:11.424 --> 13:12.323
- Max, focus.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.925
It's gonna be your
fault if Colosso

13:13.927 --> 13:15.493
ruins this wedding like
he did the last one.

13:15.495 --> 13:19.030
- No way. Last time,
Colosso had the animalizer.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.932
- BOTH:
The animalizer!

13:20.934 --> 13:22.934
- Let's see if
it's still there.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.169
- Wait, when did
Mom and Dad

13:24.171 --> 13:26.204
get a new security
system for the animalizer?

13:26.206 --> 13:28.773
- It was last year's
anniversary gift from us,

13:28.775 --> 13:29.707
along with that
vase I made them

13:29.709 --> 13:32.944
that they will
treasure forever.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.779
- [scanner hums]

13:35.081 --> 13:38.483
[sighing] Okay, good.
He hasn't gotten to it.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.984
- Not yet.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.519
- All right, let's
close this thing back up.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.888
- PHOEBE: Um--
- [scanner beeping]

13:43.890 --> 13:47.358
- Why can't I close it?
- [scanner beeping]

13:47.360 --> 13:48.326
- Denying you access

13:48.328 --> 13:52.330
was also part of last
year's anniversary gift.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.932
- COLOSSO:
Yep!

13:53.934 --> 13:55.233
- Well, at least we tried.

13:55.235 --> 13:58.102
Now let's thaw this thing
out and watch some TV.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.305
- Can I see that really quick?
- Yeah, sure.

14:00.307 --> 14:04.275
- [remote smacking]
- Help me find that bunny!

14:08.381 --> 14:11.082
- [ray zapping]

14:11.084 --> 14:13.117
- Here comes Colosso...

14:13.119 --> 14:16.154
[straining]
...any second now.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.990
[straining]

14:18.992 --> 14:21.226
[groaning]

14:21.228 --> 14:23.261
Oh, there I am.

14:23.263 --> 14:26.164
[evil laughter]

14:26.166 --> 14:28.600
- [panting]
Am I done yet?

14:28.602 --> 14:31.135
- No, give me
50 jumping jacks.

14:31.137 --> 14:34.272
- Fifty? I thought
you couldn't count that high.

14:34.274 --> 14:37.508
- Talking back?
Make that 50-12.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.311
- HANK:
[groans]

14:40.313 --> 14:42.547
- What's going on, guys?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.883
- Daddy doesn't fit
in his jacket.

14:44.885 --> 14:50.021
- Not yet, but I will after
the next 50-12 jumping jacks.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.857
- Hank, I don't care
if you fit into a tux

14:52.859 --> 14:53.591
from 20 years ago.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.894
I'd marry you again,
no matter what you wear.

14:55.896 --> 14:59.330
- This is not about
your love and support, Barb.

14:59.332 --> 15:02.033
This is a battle between
me and that tux

15:02.035 --> 15:03.401
and I am gonna win.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.169
- Didn't you once lose
10 pounds in sweat

15:05.171 --> 15:08.039
battling that supervillain
near the surface of the sun?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.307
- Oh, that's a great idea!
[laughs]

15:09.309 --> 15:11.442
I'll be back
before the wedding.

15:11.444 --> 15:12.577
[laughing]

15:12.579 --> 15:17.215
Thunder Man,
getting in shape!

15:17.584 --> 15:21.419
- Call me if
you need a trainer.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.357
- There you are.
- Did you find Colosso?

15:26.359 --> 15:27.325
- No, I found you.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.928
I thought we were
playing hide and seek.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.363
- We're supposed to
be finding Colosso.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.331
- I saw him an hour ago.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.968
He was the one who told me we
were playing hide and seek.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.638
- Okay, we've officially
searched the entire house.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.206
It's like Colosso
disappeared.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.374
- Maybe we should just
tell Mom and Dad

15:43.376 --> 15:45.243
what happened
and cancel the wedding.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.511
- No, we're not doing that.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.479
- You know, this never
would've happened

15:48.481 --> 15:50.348
if you'd have
just included me.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.616
- Max, I didn't include you

15:51.618 --> 15:53.318
because you always
ruin things.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.253
- Okay, yes, I might
ruin things.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.554
But I always fix them.

15:56.556 --> 15:59.490
It's all part of
the Maxifying process.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.626
- Okay, fine, fix this
and make sure

16:01.628 --> 16:03.962
Colosso doesn't
destroy this wedding.

16:03.964 --> 16:07.031
- I will...by...

16:07.033 --> 16:10.435
letting Colosso
destroy the wedding.

16:10.437 --> 16:13.471
I guarantee
this might work.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.642
This is weird--the wedding's
already started

16:17.644 --> 16:19.711
and Colosso still
hasn't shown up yet.

16:19.713 --> 16:20.979
- I hope he hurries.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.481
I wanna try that carrot
cake you guys got.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.249
- We thought you
guys bought it.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.484
- I don't know
who bought it.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.420
- I do!
[evil laughter]

16:29.422 --> 16:31.122
- Colosso!
- That's right!

16:31.124 --> 16:36.060
And now to turn
your parents into...

16:36.062 --> 16:36.694
Phoebe?

16:36.696 --> 16:38.196
- Colosso,
why are you human?

16:38.198 --> 16:42.667
- Why are you forcing that poor
scarecrow to marry you?

16:42.669 --> 16:44.135
- Colosso, look,

16:44.137 --> 16:46.204
let's talk about
this man-to-man.

16:46.206 --> 16:50.174
- No, thanks. I'd rather
talk man-to-pig.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.543
- [ray zapping]
- [evil laughter]

16:52.545 --> 16:55.546

- If you insist.

Oh.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.160

- Ow!

17:09.162 --> 17:13.498
Quit horsing around.

17:16.302 --> 17:18.436
- PHOEBE:
Oh, way to fix it, Max.

17:18.438 --> 17:21.706
- MAX: [snorts] I should've just
let you sign the card for me.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.407
[snorts]

17:22.409 --> 17:25.176
- Quiet down,
ya filthy animals.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.645
We've got
a wedding to start.

17:27.647 --> 17:28.713
[evil laughter]

17:28.715 --> 17:30.448
- [wedding march

17:30.450 --> 17:33.151

17:33.153 --> 17:36.054
¶ I'll turn them
into goats ¶

17:36.056 --> 17:38.022
[evil laughter]

17:38.024 --> 17:41.092
- Hank, the music's started.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.094
- Oh. Sorry.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.363
I had to take a shower
after the sun.

17:45.365 --> 17:48.766
I got space dust
in my crater.

17:48.768 --> 17:49.567
- Spare me the detail

17:49.569 --> 17:51.736
and just see if you fit
in your jacket.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.671
- Oh, it's the moment
of truth.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.307
Thunder Tux, you are
the last thing

17:56.309 --> 17:57.809
standing between me
and my wife's love.

17:57.811 --> 18:00.344
- I told you
I didn't care.

18:00.346 --> 18:03.347
- I will wear you.
You don't wear me!

18:03.349 --> 18:06.651
- Just see if
the jacket fits!

18:06.653 --> 18:09.387
- Oh.
[laughs]

18:09.389 --> 18:12.190
[laughing]
It fits!

18:12.192 --> 18:14.459
[laughing]
Woo!

18:14.461 --> 18:18.496
This is the happiest
day of my entire life--

18:18.498 --> 18:22.166
other than marrying you
and havin' a buncha children.

18:22.168 --> 18:25.603
- Oh, way to go, Hank.
I knew you could do it.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.371
- Yep, it's all
good as long as

18:27.373 --> 18:30.241
I don't eat anything
or exhale.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.442
- Okay, let's go.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.378
I can't wait to see what
surprises the kids have for us.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.747

18:39.252 --> 18:41.385
- NORA:
[whinnies]

18:41.387 --> 18:43.087
- A petting zoo?

18:43.089 --> 18:44.622
Uh, not quite what
I was picturing,

18:44.624 --> 18:49.093
but I'll try to
keep an open mind.

18:49.095 --> 18:49.827
- NORA:
[whinnies]

18:49.829 --> 18:53.131
- Yay, a pony!
- It's me, Nora.

18:53.133 --> 18:56.400
- Yay, a pony named Nora.

18:56.402 --> 18:57.802
- What is going on here?

18:57.804 --> 18:59.570
- PHOEBE:
Mom, Dad, look out!

18:59.572 --> 19:01.506
- COLOSSO:
Surprise!

19:01.508 --> 19:05.443
Pretend I'm jumping
outta that cake.

19:05.445 --> 19:05.977
- Colosso!

19:05.979 --> 19:08.179
- You turned our kids
into animals?

19:08.181 --> 19:10.348
- It wasn't that
much of a stretch.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.817
You've seen them
eat dinner.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.553
- Chloe, go back inside.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.421
We've got
a wedding crasher.

19:17.423 --> 19:18.656
- CHLOE:
[whooshes]

19:18.658 --> 19:21.159
- Hank, Barb,
I now pronounce you

19:21.161 --> 19:23.694
Mr. and Mrs. Thundergoat.

19:23.696 --> 19:28.499
- Not this time, Colosso.
- [ray zapping]

19:28.501 --> 19:30.368
- HANK: Ha.
- COLOSSO: Yeah!

19:30.370 --> 19:31.569
- HANK:
[yelps]

19:31.571 --> 19:33.704
- [ray and electricity
zapping]

19:33.706 --> 19:37.341
- Keep him busy.
I have an idea.

19:37.343 --> 19:40.578
- Am I just threatening
him so you can eat?

19:40.580 --> 19:42.680
- Yes.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.149
- What do you see
in him, Barbara?

19:45.151 --> 19:47.451
- The man who's
about to beat you.

19:47.453 --> 19:50.188
- What?
You're gonna eat me?

19:50.190 --> 19:52.323
- I said beat you.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.926
- [button ricocheting]

20:00.433 --> 20:03.167
- Back to the cage
for you, Colosso.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.870
- [ray zapping]
- No!

20:05.872 --> 20:09.240
[screaming]

20:09.509 --> 20:14.745
Oh, well, see you
at the 40th anniversary.

20:14.747 --> 20:15.580
- [sighs]
Well, Hank.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.216
Your Thunder Tux has never
looked better on you.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.218
- Oh, and you're
even more beautiful

20:20.220 --> 20:21.852
than you were on
our first wedding day.

20:21.854 --> 20:25.756
- Aw...that was
a goat, but thank you.

20:25.758 --> 20:26.357
- [kisses]

20:26.359 --> 20:28.926
- MAX: Your children
are still animals.

20:28.928 --> 20:32.296
- Oh, right, the kids.

20:32.298 --> 20:34.966
- [ray zapping]

20:36.903 --> 20:37.902
- Mom, Dad, we are so sorry.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.838
We really wanted you guys
to have a nice wedding.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.808
- What? Are you kidding?
This is amazing.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.376
- PHOEBE, MAX, NORA, BILLY:
It is?

20:45.378 --> 20:47.245
- Yeah, we finally
stopped Colosso

20:47.247 --> 20:48.813
from destroying
our wedding.

20:48.815 --> 20:51.515
- And that mashed potato
bar is delicious.

20:51.517 --> 20:54.285
This really is
the wedding of our dreams.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.220
- Well, then, I guess you
guys should thank Max.

20:56.222 --> 20:59.390
He's the reason for all this
weirdness and destruction.

20:59.392 --> 21:00.658
- [laughs]
Yeah.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.660
I Maxified your wedding!

21:02.662 --> 21:05.263
- Well, who's ready
to get married?

21:05.265 --> 21:06.297
- Oh, I am.
- Hm.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.432
- But, uh, who's gonna
perform the ceremony?

21:08.434 --> 21:11.969
- Oops, it looks like
we forgot that little detail.

21:11.971 --> 21:15.306
- Ahem! I know
someone who can do it.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.408
- Justin Timberlake?

21:17.410 --> 21:18.643
- No, me.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.811
- Are we really that
desperate, Hank?

21:20.813 --> 21:22.947
- [laughing]
Absolutely not.

21:22.949 --> 21:28.519
- I now pronounce you
Thunder Man and Superwife.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.420
- HANK:
Hey! Hey! Hey!

21:29.422 --> 21:30.955
- COLOSSO: You may
not kiss the bride

21:30.957 --> 21:33.724
because nobody
wants to see that.

21:33.726 --> 21:36.027
- Truth, yo!

21:36.029 --> 21:37.561
- Smile!

21:37.563 --> 21:38.963
- [phone camera clicks]

21:38.965 --> 21:40.264
- ALL
[cheering]

21:40.266 --> 21:41.866
- Congratulations,
you two.

21:41.868 --> 21:42.800
- HANK:
[laughing]

21:42.802 --> 21:44.669
- Hey, we should get
this picture framed

21:44.671 --> 21:45.436
for next year's gift.

21:45.438 --> 21:46.704
- Oh, yeah. Max, do you
wanna pick out a frame?

21:46.706 --> 21:49.840
- Ah, it sounds like work.
Just sign the card for me.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.810
- All right, let's dance.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.746
- [dance music]

21:55.748 --> 21:57.281
¶

21:57.283 --> 21:59.583
- Should we tell Nora
she still has a tail?

21:59.585 --> 22:01.319
- Ah, she's havin' fun.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.953
We'll tell her later.

22:02.955 --> 22:07.658
- ¶

22:10.596 --> 22:26.577
- ¶
