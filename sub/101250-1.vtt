WEBVTT

00:13.847 --> 00:14.931
Meow.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.281
-[indistinct chatter]
-[grunting]

00:46.546 --> 00:48.923
-[clatters]
-[sighs, groans]

00:50.133 --> 00:51.760
Huh? [stammers]

00:51.843 --> 00:52.761
Sorry!

00:55.180 --> 00:56.598
[exhales]

00:56.681 --> 00:57.640
Blast it.

01:06.107 --> 01:08.234
[yawns]

01:11.112 --> 01:12.447
[Merlin] Hisirdoux!

01:12.781 --> 01:15.450
-[yells, grunts]
-What have we talked about?

01:15.533 --> 01:18.745
"Magic isn't a permissible shortcut
to hard work."

01:18.912 --> 01:20.121
Carry on, and don't...

01:20.330 --> 01:23.041
-But, Master--
-..."but, Master" me.

01:23.124 --> 01:28.546
I'm just-- I know I'm capable
of more than just pushing a broom.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.424
[grunting]

01:31.508 --> 01:33.760
Teach me to be a proper sorcerer!

01:33.843 --> 01:36.846
If there is a universal truth
in this world,

01:36.930 --> 01:42.227
it is that struggle is the flame
which forges one's soul into steel.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.479
Magic cannot be a crutch.

01:44.646 --> 01:45.688
Ha-ha! [grunts]

01:45.772 --> 01:50.819
To take the easy way out
is to merely exist, Hisirdoux.

01:50.902 --> 01:54.030
So, why am I learning spells
if I'm not supposed to use them?

01:54.114 --> 01:56.282
I wanna be a wizard like you!

01:56.366 --> 01:58.159
With a staff and everything!

01:58.243 --> 02:01.871
Staffs are for those
with mastery over magic,

02:01.955 --> 02:04.165
and magic is mastery over life.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.751
So first, you must learn how to live.

02:06.960 --> 02:12.132
Master that lesson, and I vow
your days of pushing brooms will be over.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.268
[sighs] Blast it.

02:24.435 --> 02:26.521
[sighing]

02:26.688 --> 02:28.356
[yawns]

02:28.439 --> 02:31.734
"Magic isn't a permissible shortcut
to hard work."

02:33.153 --> 02:35.363
-'Night, Doux! Thanks for cleaning up!
-Of course!

02:36.406 --> 02:37.407
[cat yelps]

02:39.450 --> 02:41.035
Right, time for the real work.

02:41.744 --> 02:43.163
-You ready?
-[meows]

02:46.249 --> 02:48.710
[purrs, meows]

02:57.135 --> 02:58.636
[squelching]

03:06.728 --> 03:07.937
[snarls]

03:08.688 --> 03:11.441
-Ha-ha!
-[snarling]

03:11.900 --> 03:14.235
[laughs] 'Tis my cleanest capture yet!

03:14.319 --> 03:15.320
Ha-ha!

03:15.403 --> 03:18.197
Aren't you a nasty little beast?

03:18.281 --> 03:21.367
I figured an umber imp
was the reason for all those lost pets.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.037
That is not an umber imp.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.624
Do you notice the three mandibles?

03:28.041 --> 03:30.126
How it's phasing in and out of existence?

03:30.209 --> 03:31.586
That's a shadow mephit.

03:31.669 --> 03:35.256
And you should know your monsterology
if you're going to use me as bait.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.967
Either way, let's take a sec
to recognize that I've--

03:38.051 --> 03:40.720
we've done some very good magic tonight.

03:40.803 --> 03:43.681
-Douxie, old pal--
-No, no, no, revel in the victory.

03:43.765 --> 03:46.309
We're unappreciated, Arch,
silent sentinels

03:46.392 --> 03:49.729
keeping the world safe
from specters and demons and--

03:50.146 --> 03:51.481
It's out of the trap, isn't it?

03:51.564 --> 03:54.817
-[snarls]
-[screams, grunts]

03:56.027 --> 03:58.112
[Archie] Your capture technique
is still weak,

03:58.196 --> 04:00.406
and you could use
a couple more centuries of practice.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.117
I will not be lectured
by someone who licks their own butt!

04:03.201 --> 04:05.495
-[Archie] It's hygienic!
-No, no, not this one.

04:05.578 --> 04:06.496
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

04:06.579 --> 04:09.374
Let's see you phase through this,
you little git!

04:10.333 --> 04:13.836
[chuckles] Got you-- This totally worked
on that specterghast.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.172
[Archie] Back in Babylon.
That was a fun night. Heads up!

04:16.256 --> 04:18.591
No, it had five heads. [grunts] Arch!

04:18.675 --> 04:19.592
Whoa!

04:19.676 --> 04:22.470
Fuzz buckets! [grunting]

04:22.804 --> 04:24.138
It's working!

04:24.222 --> 04:26.432
I've-- I've almost... [grunting]

04:26.516 --> 04:28.226
worn him down! [screams]

04:32.939 --> 04:35.191
Uh... I've-- I've got it! I've got it!
I've...

04:38.945 --> 04:42.824
Also, unlike umber imps,
mephits are vulnerable to fire.

04:42.907 --> 04:43.908
Saucy midge.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.244
Your pet-munching days are over!

04:46.327 --> 04:49.289
-Say "hi" to everyone in limbo for me.
-[squealing]

04:52.083 --> 04:52.917
[pants]

04:53.001 --> 04:54.836
You're welcome, Arcadia!

04:55.128 --> 04:58.631
Strange. A lone shadow mephit
snacking on pets.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.050
Where there's one, there's usually more.

05:01.592 --> 05:02.927
[car alarm blaring]

05:03.011 --> 05:03.970
[Merlin] <i>Hisirdoux...</i>

05:04.137 --> 05:05.013
Merlin?

05:05.471 --> 05:06.848
Merlin? Yes!

05:06.931 --> 05:09.475
Finally, Arch! Our moment has arrived!

05:09.559 --> 05:10.935
Hisirdoux.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.354
Master Merlin.

05:13.438 --> 05:16.357
Hisirdoux, my faithful apprentice,
I need--

05:16.441 --> 05:19.944
You're darn right I've been faithful!
I've been mopping for a millennium!

05:20.028 --> 05:22.155
Why didn't you send a raven or a text?

05:22.238 --> 05:23.781
There's texting now, you know.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.534
-I was busy, as you know.
-Yeah?

05:26.826 --> 05:28.244
Well, I've been quite busy, too,

05:28.328 --> 05:30.747
protecting the material plane
while you weren't around.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.374
-Hisirdoux, I need you--
-About time.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.668
I've been practicing my incantations
and my spells--

05:35.752 --> 05:37.879
Enough! Matters are most dire!

05:37.962 --> 05:42.842
I need you to bring me
the Guardians of Arcadia, with haste!

05:43.301 --> 05:46.637
Oh, it's our moment, all right,
as errand boys.

05:46.721 --> 05:50.308
Man, the rest of this summer's
gonna eat farts.

05:50.391 --> 05:53.728
Yeah, it is kind of hard to top
destroying an alien god.

05:53.811 --> 05:56.481
Wingman did good. Proud.

05:56.564 --> 05:59.525
But I lost my butt-stomping,
ninja-space-angel girlfriend

05:59.609 --> 06:02.028
and my creepslaying partner
in the same afternoon.

06:02.111 --> 06:05.907
Yeah, I felt like that after Jim and
Claire and everybody left on their quest--

06:05.990 --> 06:09.577
Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're talking about
my problems here, buttsnack.

06:09.660 --> 06:10.745
[Palchuk screams]

06:10.828 --> 06:12.413
Cat! Yum.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.082
Ooh, hey, little guy!

06:14.165 --> 06:15.416
You lost?

06:15.500 --> 06:19.712
Beware. You, you are in grave danger.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.130
Whoa! A cat with glasses!

06:21.214 --> 06:23.716
The cat just talked
and you're focused on its eyewear?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.511
I've seen aliens, creeps,
and trolls, Domzalski.

06:26.594 --> 06:30.348
So, yeah, I'd like to know
why the talking cat's wearing glasses.

06:30.431 --> 06:31.808
Bad eyesight.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.851
Not cat. Familiar.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.229
"Familiar"? [chuckles] No way.

06:36.312 --> 06:38.940
I'd remember if I met a cat with glasses.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.150
No. Wizard assistant.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.444
"Assistant"? That's very offensive.

06:43.528 --> 06:46.948
I am a wizard associate,
thank you very much.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.117
Now, come with me
or the worst will come to pass.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.494
Hey! Are you threatening me, pussycat?

06:51.577 --> 06:53.663
No, I'm warning you.

06:53.746 --> 06:57.792
Put simply, the world as you know it
is about to end.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.043
Meow.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.587
[Toby] Wha...

07:01.671 --> 07:05.883
Aw, not again! [yelling]

07:06.634 --> 07:08.302
[theme music playing]

07:37.999 --> 07:40.084
Sorry, this is a lot to process!

07:40.168 --> 07:43.087
Pets can talk?
The world is ending? Again?

07:43.171 --> 07:46.048
Not the best timing, I know,
but we need your help all the same.

07:46.215 --> 07:47.633
Douxie? Wai-- Hold up!

07:47.717 --> 07:50.970
I thought you worked at the cafe
or were, like, a model or something.

07:51.053 --> 07:54.557
[chuckles] There's a lot about me
you don't know.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.725
-Whoa!
-What?

07:59.854 --> 08:00.855
Come on, then.

08:00.938 --> 08:03.024
The answers
to all your questions are within.

08:03.107 --> 08:04.942
Yeah, right. In a bookstore?

08:05.026 --> 08:08.196
[Toby] Ah! There's flying books.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.406
Whoa!

08:10.490 --> 08:13.409
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

08:13.493 --> 08:15.495
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

08:15.578 --> 08:17.413
So cool! So cool! So cool!

08:17.497 --> 08:20.541
-Ooh, what's that?
-[Merlin] Put that down!

08:20.625 --> 08:22.251
Thank the ether you're here.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.920
We haven't a moment to waste.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.130
-[Toby laughing]
-Whoa! Crusty, creepy dude!

08:26.214 --> 08:28.633
Though, I had hoped for more, Hisirdoux.

08:28.716 --> 08:31.761
I tried. I couldn't find
the changelings or the aliens.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.346
I'm pretty sure most left the planet.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.932
Merlin, it's me-- Toby Domzalski!

08:36.015 --> 08:40.019
You know, War Hammer, Guardian of Arcadia,
Geology Club president.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.146
No one could forget you, chatty.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.191
And Steve Palchuk, Creepslayer!

08:45.274 --> 08:47.652
-I have no idea who you are.
-[Palchuk yelps]

08:47.902 --> 08:50.655
[Merlin] But we're desperate.
Thankfully, we have the brute.

08:50.738 --> 08:54.325
-Yum! [grunts]
-I'm not anybody's lunch. Got it?

08:54.408 --> 08:55.952
Wait, where's Jimbo and Claire?

08:56.035 --> 08:57.370
I thought they were with you.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.788
Answers forthcoming.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.040
Make preparations. We've a journey ahead.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.291
-And don't...
-But, Master--

09:02.375 --> 09:04.168
..."but, Master" me.

09:04.252 --> 09:07.171
But... are you sure you want
to count on these children?

09:07.255 --> 09:11.342
-They're clearly not ready for this.
-[scoffs] Excuse me, college dude,

09:11.592 --> 09:16.138
these children fought off
a 50-foot extraterrestrial! [screams]

09:16.222 --> 09:17.473
Dude, let go of its head!

09:17.557 --> 09:20.226
-[Palchuk] It's got my head, too, man!
-Just put it back!

09:20.309 --> 09:22.395
-Master, I'm ready for this.
-Doubtful.

09:22.478 --> 09:25.606
-I've spent years preparing, centuries--
-Silence!

09:25.690 --> 09:26.524
[sighs]

09:26.607 --> 09:28.651
I mean, silence, all of you.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.361
Can you not hear that?

09:31.279 --> 09:32.947
[rumbling]

09:33.030 --> 09:35.616
[chimes clinking]

09:37.660 --> 09:40.454
[creaking]

09:41.789 --> 09:44.041
[cuckoo clock clucking]

09:44.125 --> 09:47.253
Something wicked this way comes.

09:56.470 --> 09:57.638
-[snarling]
-[Douxie gasps]

09:58.848 --> 10:00.057
[Merlin] Shadow mephits?

10:00.349 --> 10:03.269
-Hisirdoux, did you lead them here?
-No, no!

10:03.352 --> 10:06.314
-I mean, I don't think so? [chuckles]
-Yes, we did.

10:08.816 --> 10:09.984
[squealing]

10:10.276 --> 10:12.862
He found us.
The barrier won't hold for long.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.032
We must make egress!
Tobias, take my things!

10:16.115 --> 10:17.325
[screams]

10:19.285 --> 10:20.828
All of you, to the roof!

10:20.911 --> 10:23.205
Hisirdoux, I said get to safety.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.416
-I've got this. I can help.
-Ugh.

10:25.499 --> 10:28.294
Still trying to earn that staff, are you?

10:28.377 --> 10:31.547
Yeah. I've learned a thing or two
since we last met.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.591
Use the Flux Rune Second.

10:33.674 --> 10:36.093
-It's stronger.
-All right! I knew that!

10:36.177 --> 10:37.637
-Douxie!
-Arch!

10:39.055 --> 10:41.307
-[Archie] I'm fine. No need to worry.
-[grunts]

10:52.026 --> 10:53.110
[squealing]

10:56.155 --> 10:57.990
[chuckling]

10:58.074 --> 10:59.241
Fire?

10:59.784 --> 11:01.494
Yeah. Magic fire!

11:01.577 --> 11:02.912
In a bookstore?

11:02.995 --> 11:04.914
-But mephits are vulnerable to fire--
-Move it!

11:06.123 --> 11:07.208
-[snarls]
-[grunts]

11:07.333 --> 11:08.876
[Aaarrrgghh roars]

11:09.543 --> 11:10.753
Stand back!

11:11.462 --> 11:12.380
[Palchuk] Whoa!

11:12.463 --> 11:14.882
Ship just got real!

11:15.966 --> 11:18.177
-[Aaarrrgghh] Everyone on!
-[screaming, grunting]

11:18.511 --> 11:21.305
-[snarling]
-[Aaarrrgghh growling]

11:23.599 --> 11:24.433
[grunts]

11:25.476 --> 11:28.437
-[Aaarrrgghh grunts]
-[Palchuk screams]

11:32.149 --> 11:34.402
[all grunting]

11:40.241 --> 11:41.242
[man] Boy...

11:44.620 --> 11:46.414
Look out! [grunts]

11:56.715 --> 12:00.386
Awesome sauce!

12:00.970 --> 12:03.931
-[Palchuk] Whoo!
-[Toby] Whoo!

12:08.227 --> 12:10.771
This is so cool!

12:11.147 --> 12:12.523
What the heck is that?

12:12.606 --> 12:16.652
Welcome, young squires, to Camelot.

12:17.736 --> 12:18.737
[Toby] Camelot?

12:18.821 --> 12:21.407
As in ancient-old-people-times Camelot?

12:23.242 --> 12:28.372
Excuse me, I have a question.
How is this castle flying right now?

12:28.706 --> 12:30.708
[Merlin] The Heart of Avalon.

12:30.791 --> 12:36.797
Its magic keeps Camelot aloft,
powered by time itself.

12:37.715 --> 12:40.634
Sir Galahad, how look the skies?

12:40.718 --> 12:43.179
All quiet, my old friend!

12:43.262 --> 12:45.764
[Merlin] Keep your eyes on the horizon.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.600
[Palchuk screaming]

12:47.683 --> 12:50.436
I say, coming in a little hot,
don't you think?

12:50.519 --> 12:51.562
Rubbish!

12:57.276 --> 12:58.986
[Palchuk] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

12:59.195 --> 13:00.488
[Toby] Whoa!

13:00.571 --> 13:03.866
It's been 900 years since I was last here.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.367
Hasn't changed a bit.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.411
-Except for the flying part.
-[chuckles]

13:07.495 --> 13:09.622
"Nine hundred years"? Yeah, right.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.290
You're like, what? Like, 19?

13:11.373 --> 13:13.542
Give or take a few centuries.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.505
[Palchuk] So, how many things
can your cat turn into?

13:17.588 --> 13:19.548
[Douxie] That depends.
How many things are there?

13:19.632 --> 13:21.258
[Toby] Uh, cool floating castle ship,

13:21.550 --> 13:23.969
but what's the grave danger
you keep talking about?

13:24.053 --> 13:25.554
Ah, there you are.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.056
-Claire!
-Toby!

13:27.139 --> 13:29.808
-Aarghaumont!
-Blinky!

13:29.892 --> 13:32.478
-Not so tight.
-Oh, sorry.

13:32.561 --> 13:36.190
Whoa, hey, Steve's here, too!
How 'bout-- how 'bout some love for Steve?

13:36.273 --> 13:38.150
Oh. Hi, Steve.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.610
What happened to you guys?

13:39.693 --> 13:42.279
-Wait, where's Jim?
-[sighs]

13:43.447 --> 13:44.532
Jim...

13:45.449 --> 13:46.867
What happened to him?

13:47.159 --> 13:48.744
[Blinky] We were ambushed.

13:48.827 --> 13:51.330
Some ancient, dark warrior.

13:51.622 --> 13:55.084
An unstoppable knight clad in green...

13:55.167 --> 13:57.878
-[scream echoes]
-...who struck down Master Jim.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.131
Master, is that the same knight
we saw at the bookstore?

14:01.215 --> 14:02.383
One and the same.

14:02.591 --> 14:05.886
That onyx shard is working its way
towards his heart.

14:05.970 --> 14:10.474
I placed the boy in stasis,
stalling its progress... for now.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.894
If I had my Shadow Staff,
I could've saved him.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.605
Who is this Green Knight?
How do I get my hands on him?

14:16.855 --> 14:17.940
I do not know.

14:18.023 --> 14:22.319
The Green Knight said but one name,
which chilled me to the bone.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.406
[Green Knight] Morgana...

14:25.489 --> 14:27.074
Oh, I hate that lady.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.493
Wait, I thought we kicked her butt
to the Shadow Realm.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.831
Which he appeared not to know,
but he bore the emblem of Camelot.

14:36.667 --> 14:41.005
Come with me, quickly.
I fear the answer lies in the past.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.720
A dark menace is coming,

14:47.803 --> 14:51.015
one even I cannot face alone.

14:51.765 --> 14:56.103
You are all now soldiers
in a war started centuries ago

14:56.186 --> 14:57.855
for the world of magic.

14:58.272 --> 15:03.110
Once, the realms of Magic and Man
clashed in endless bloodshed.

15:03.193 --> 15:06.906
King Arthur sought to wipe out magic
that ravaged the lands

15:06.989 --> 15:08.824
in his war against Gunmar.

15:08.908 --> 15:13.120
I brought what few spellcasters
I could under my protection

15:13.203 --> 15:14.830
to spare them from the sword...

15:14.914 --> 15:15.831
Including myself.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.750
Oh, and Morgana le Fay.

15:17.833 --> 15:21.170
She was the finest student
I ever taught...

15:21.253 --> 15:23.213
until she tried to kill me.

15:23.380 --> 15:28.469
Thankfully, in my all-seeing wisdom,
I created a secret weapon--

15:28.552 --> 15:30.429
the Trollhunter amulet.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.431
The war came to a standstill

15:32.514 --> 15:36.560
and I imprisoned Morgana
at the Battle of Killahead Bridge.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.271
-[thunder rumbling]
-Hmm.

15:39.855 --> 15:42.149
[Merlin] This Green Knight
that assailed us

15:42.232 --> 15:44.193
-was clearly born of dark magicks...
-[gasps]

15:44.610 --> 15:46.695
...but I have no memory of him

15:47.071 --> 15:49.990
nor what connection
he could have to Morgana.

15:50.991 --> 15:55.788
We know not what he is
nor why he pursues us.

15:56.038 --> 15:59.708
Though, his presence is a dire omen
of things to come.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.960
-[bell ringing]
-[all gasp]

16:03.545 --> 16:04.546
[all grunt]

16:05.130 --> 16:06.799
[grunting]

16:08.050 --> 16:10.052
[grunting]

16:10.135 --> 16:13.681
-What's happening?
-Have you never been under attack before?

16:13.764 --> 16:15.265
To the battlements!

16:15.349 --> 16:18.143
[Palchuk grunts]
Yeah! Battlements, totally!

16:18.227 --> 16:20.312
What is a battlement?

16:20.396 --> 16:22.648
[automated voice] <i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>I couldn't find "bagel mints."</i>

16:22.731 --> 16:23.565
Battlements!

16:28.237 --> 16:29.488
-[Blinky gasps]
-[Claire gasps]

16:29.571 --> 16:31.115
-What the...?
-[Archie] Oh, no!

16:31.198 --> 16:34.201
I think we have something of a problem.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.370
[Douxie] Oh, fuzz buckets.

16:36.453 --> 16:39.456
[Merlin] No... the Arcane Order...

16:39.540 --> 16:40.624
they found us.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.927
Everyone, get to safety, now!

16:53.846 --> 16:55.889
<i>Fulgur praeca!</i>

16:56.724 --> 16:58.183
[grunts] My staff!

16:59.018 --> 17:00.185
I've got it!

17:04.690 --> 17:06.608
-[grunts]
-I lost it!

17:08.694 --> 17:11.488
[snarling]

17:13.741 --> 17:15.868
-[grunts]
-Man the cannons!

17:31.800 --> 17:33.135
We must flee!

17:33.218 --> 17:36.472
[Douxie] I'm on it! [grunts]
I've got it, I've got it, I've got it.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.229
-[grunts]
-[all grunting]

17:46.148 --> 17:47.357
They're boarding us!

17:47.441 --> 17:48.942
We must break free!

17:49.026 --> 17:51.695
-Steer us clear at my command!
-[Douxie] I'm on it!

17:53.280 --> 17:54.323
[Palchuk scream, whimpers]

17:54.406 --> 17:57.117
All of a sudden,
flying castles aren't so cool!

17:58.452 --> 18:00.245
[Blinky screams]

18:00.329 --> 18:01.205
Master Jim!

18:05.334 --> 18:08.087
[panting, grunting]

18:09.213 --> 18:11.131
-[screams]
-Blinky!

18:11.215 --> 18:13.926
[screaming]

18:14.009 --> 18:15.094
[Aaarrrgghh growls]

18:15.260 --> 18:18.972
-Have you found the staff?
-[Archie] I'm on it!

18:19.056 --> 18:21.100
[grunts] Got you, Jim!

18:21.558 --> 18:22.392
[grunts]

18:22.476 --> 18:25.354
These foes' powers are beyond us!

18:25.437 --> 18:27.564
-[Nari] Merlin!
-No! Nari!

18:27.815 --> 18:29.608
-[grunts]
-This is all my fault.

18:29.691 --> 18:32.402
I will take us to the past,
but you must help me.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.446
I will do what I can.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.326
[screeching]

18:41.120 --> 18:42.704
[Claire] We've got to protect Jim!

18:42.788 --> 18:44.623
I'm not losing him again!

18:44.706 --> 18:48.127
-Feel the wrath of the hammer!
-[Claire yelling]

18:48.210 --> 18:50.420
[Palchuk] Die, creeper!

18:50.504 --> 18:52.339
Where's the staff? Where's the staff?

18:52.422 --> 18:55.551
Archie, find the staff
or we are all dead meat!

18:55.634 --> 18:57.344
[Archie] What do you people
think I'm doing?

19:00.889 --> 19:02.015
[grunts]

19:02.099 --> 19:05.185
Archie, I'm running out of time, here!

19:05.269 --> 19:06.395
[Archie] Got it!

19:09.231 --> 19:11.608
-[Toby grunts]
-[grunts]

19:16.822 --> 19:22.327
Surrender, Merlin. [chuckles]

19:22.494 --> 19:24.037
-Never.
-[Galahad] Merlin!

19:24.371 --> 19:25.330
Merlin!

19:25.414 --> 19:27.249
Get everyone to safety!

19:27.833 --> 19:31.503
-[yells]
-No, Galahad! What are you doing?!

19:36.758 --> 19:39.344
Farewell, my old friend.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.096
Hisirdoux, now!

19:41.305 --> 19:43.473
Please don't blow us up.
Please don't blow us up.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.475
We don't have enough power for the jump!

19:45.559 --> 19:47.394
[Douxie] Trust in Merlin!

19:51.106 --> 19:52.608
[grunts]

19:58.947 --> 20:00.240
Hold together. Come on!

20:04.745 --> 20:08.874
[grunts] We have to steer Camelot
through the time rift!

20:17.591 --> 20:18.425
[gasps]

20:19.593 --> 20:20.928
[Green Knight] It ends...

20:22.763 --> 20:23.805
now!

20:26.058 --> 20:27.643
Oh, sod it all.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.481
-[explosion]
-[grunting]

20:32.564 --> 20:33.899
Jimbo!

20:34.274 --> 20:35.275
[grunting]

20:35.359 --> 20:37.277
[screaming]

20:38.403 --> 20:39.404
[Claire] Jim!

20:39.780 --> 20:40.781
Jim!

20:41.031 --> 20:42.866
-What do we do, man?
-Trust me!

20:42.950 --> 20:45.577
Wait! No, no, no! [screams]

20:45.661 --> 20:49.665
Flying castles suck!

20:54.586 --> 20:57.256
[explosions]

20:59.675 --> 21:01.301
-[Palchuk screams]
-[Archie] Douxie!

21:01.551 --> 21:02.386
Oh, no!

21:02.469 --> 21:06.306
Curses, Hisirdoux, you were
supposed to steer us to safety!

21:06.390 --> 21:09.226
<i>Tenebris exilium!</i>

21:11.103 --> 21:14.314
Must I always do everything myself?

21:18.026 --> 21:19.403
[panting]

21:19.486 --> 21:21.238
Wh-- Where's the Trollhunter?

21:21.321 --> 21:23.699
They fell right through the portal.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.243
-Where did they go?
-Great Gronka Morka...

21:26.326 --> 21:29.955
I fear it's not a question of where,
but rather when.

21:32.416 --> 21:35.377
[all screaming]

21:35.460 --> 21:36.503
[grunting]

21:36.586 --> 21:38.714
Oh, come on! Come on!

21:39.631 --> 21:41.091
This is gonna hurt!

21:41.174 --> 21:43.760
[Palchuk screams] It... does... hurt!

21:43.844 --> 21:45.178
[Douxie screams, grunts]

21:45.345 --> 21:47.264
-[Palchuk grunts]
-[grunts]

21:47.347 --> 21:49.474
-[Palchuk] Oh, God...
-[Douxie groans, grunts]

21:50.642 --> 21:51.852
[Palchuk gasping, screaming]

21:51.935 --> 21:53.729
I can't see! I'm blind!

21:54.146 --> 21:55.105
Oh, I can see.

21:56.440 --> 22:00.902
-Ah! [whimpering]
-[cracking]

22:01.069 --> 22:03.322
[Palchuk] What just happened?

22:03.405 --> 22:05.741
Well, I just conjured
an anti-gravity spell

22:05.824 --> 22:08.327
to slow our fall and keep us from dying.

22:08.410 --> 22:09.453
You're welcome.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.789
Douxie, where is the flying castle?

22:12.873 --> 22:15.459
Oh, fuzz buckets!

22:15.542 --> 22:20.172
Well, it would appear we've had ourselves
a temporal accident.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.090
-Which means?
-[Palchuk whimpers]

22:22.174 --> 22:23.800
-[gasps]
-[man1] Advance!

22:23.967 --> 22:25.010
[man 2] Got them.

22:26.094 --> 22:28.680
[all gasping]

22:29.806 --> 22:31.266
-[Palchuk screams]
-It means...

22:31.349 --> 22:33.435
we are lost in time.

22:33.518 --> 22:36.354
[man 3] What manner of sorcery is this?

22:36.438 --> 22:38.190
Oh-- Oh, my...

22:38.315 --> 22:40.650
[screams]

22:40.859 --> 22:43.487
[instrumental music playing]
