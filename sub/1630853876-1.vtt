No. No, no, no. No, no, no!

No!

Hey, Bud. Nice look.

10:17.291 --> 10:20.833
…everything, the package isn't here.
Bud, I need your rent.

10:20.916 --> 10:22.083
So I'll look again…

10:55.708 --> 10:57.250
Oh shit!

11:22.000 --> 11:25.416
I'm calling because your husband
is late again picking up Paige.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.875
Do you have an ETA
of when we should expect him?

11:28.458 --> 11:31.375
All right, but this is
the third time this week that he's late.

11:31.875 --> 11:34.250
I shouldn't have to remind you that…

11:34.333 --> 11:36.500
-Just a sec. He's pulling up.

11:36.583 --> 11:37.500
Paige!

-Come on, baby!

11:46.958 --> 11:48.500

11:49.750 --> 11:51.583
-Who's your favorite daddy?
-You.

11:51.666 --> 11:53.958
I'm your only daddy, I hope. What's up?

11:54.041 --> 11:55.625
-You're late, you know?
-What?

11:55.708 --> 11:56.958
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

11:57.041 --> 11:59.166
You know why I'm late? 'Cause this job.

11:59.250 --> 12:02.041
-Work is dumb.
-Oh, well, yes, it is.

12:02.125 --> 12:04.333
And what do you have in your hand? Oh…

12:04.416 --> 12:07.666
-A little something.
-Shaboom! I love that.

12:07.750 --> 12:09.458
-How about this? Hmm?

12:09.541 --> 12:11.958
-All right.
-Can we go to Yogurtworld?

12:12.041 --> 12:14.333
Yogurtworld. Oh, Pickle, I don't know.

12:14.416 --> 12:16.583
Your mom is already upset
because we're late.

12:16.666 --> 12:18.250
Whose fault is that?

12:19.166 --> 12:20.083
Harsh.

12:20.791 --> 12:22.583
But true. Roll the dice.

12:22.666 --> 12:25.375

Oh, she wanted to hang out with you.

13:58.208 --> 14:01.708
See, that's something she coulda done
if you'd taken her to school like I asked.

14:01.791 --> 14:03.333

14:03.416 --> 14:05.458
That pool cleaning appointment
this morning?

-Exactly.
-Right.

14:06.958 --> 14:08.250
Whose house was it?

14:09.291 --> 14:12.500
It was Mrs… uh… Mrs. Jones' house.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.416
Where's she live?

14:15.125 --> 14:16.041
She, uh…

14:16.541 --> 14:18.208
With Mr. Jones. That's exactly…

14:18.291 --> 14:21.125
-Right over there on Mr. Jones Way.
-Oh my God. Bud.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.375
We'd get much further
if you'd be straight with me.

14:23.458 --> 14:25.041
-I am being straight.
-You're not.

14:25.125 --> 14:29.458
I am being straight, but the question is,
what is that sponge doing on the ground?

14:29.541 --> 14:31.208
And this? What is all this?

14:31.291 --> 14:33.041

14:33.125 --> 14:34.500
Mm-hmm. I see that. And why?

14:34.583 --> 14:35.833
Uh, what does it matter?

14:35.916 --> 14:38.458
-You don't live here anymore.
-Wow, that's what we doing?

14:38.541 --> 14:40.833
What I was gonna tell you
is that this tile goes…

14:43.666 --> 14:45.791
Joss, what's this? This a new door?

14:45.875 --> 14:46.875
Uh…

14:48.375 --> 14:50.625
A door with five locks doesn't exactly

14:50.708 --> 14:53.875
send the right impression
to potential buyers.

14:53.958 --> 14:57.000
Buyers? Buyers?
What are you talking about, Joss?

14:57.083 --> 14:59.333
I didn't want to tell you this way, but…

15:00.666 --> 15:03.875
I'm thinking about selling the house
and taking my mom up on her offer.

15:05.083 --> 15:06.625
You and your momma.

15:06.708 --> 15:07.750

15:08.250 --> 15:10.333
What are you talking about?
You can't move to Florida.

15:10.416 --> 15:13.458
All her friends are here.
I'm here. Her world is here.

15:13.541 --> 15:14.541
She needs stability.

15:14.625 --> 15:17.000
She has stability.
She got you. She got me.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.250
She got Yogurtworld.
Ain't no Yogurtworld in Florida!

15:19.333 --> 15:20.875
Yeah, and she also has a school

15:20.958 --> 15:24.208
that she's not gonna be able to go to
unless we pay tuition by Monday.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.583

15:26.083 --> 15:27.708
Monday? Monday, like in seven days?

15:27.791 --> 15:30.666
Yeah, which you would know
if you had checked your voice mails.

15:30.750 --> 15:32.541
Is that the stability you talk about?

15:32.625 --> 15:34.125
-How much is it?
-Five grand.

15:34.208 --> 15:35.916
Five thousand dollars for a child?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.458
Mm-hmm. And she needs braces.

15:38.041 --> 15:39.875
-What's wrong?
-Her teeth are jacked up.

15:39.958 --> 15:43.041
She always says she likes her teeth
'cause they look like my teeth.

15:44.208 --> 15:45.208
That's my point.

15:45.291 --> 15:48.583
Okay. Well, how much are braces?
What? Five, six hundred dollars?

15:48.666 --> 15:51.250
-Without insurance, try six grand.
-Six grand?

15:51.333 --> 15:53.791
But I did find a guy who quoted me $4,800.

15:53.875 --> 15:56.166

-Yeah.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.541

15:59.916 --> 16:02.625

16:02.708 --> 16:05.875
Ten grand. Tuition, teeth, everything.

16:11.333 --> 16:13.666

19:02.125 --> 19:04.291
which she's not.

19:04.375 --> 19:05.500
Check this out.

19:05.583 --> 19:08.041
A decade early
and a whole lot of dollars short,

19:08.125 --> 19:11.375
so I can give you like two grand for this.

19:11.458 --> 19:12.666
-Two thousand, Troy?
-Mm-hmm.

19:12.750 --> 19:13.958
Two thousand?

19:14.041 --> 19:16.333
Listen, I don't think you understand.
I need cash today.

19:16.416 --> 19:19.625
Then go and rob a bank or do something.
I'm a businessman!

19:19.708 --> 19:22.208
Forget the Elder's.
How about this? Silver.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.250
Hmm?

19:23.333 --> 19:25.125
Silver? This is…

19:25.791 --> 19:29.791
-Just gonna put that in your mouth, huh?
-This plated shit? Please, Bud.

19:30.291 --> 19:32.083
You wanna make a deal or not?

19:35.500 --> 19:36.333
Shit.

19:41.041 --> 19:42.333
Snake Eyes, 1,500.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.083
Ah, twelve.

19:45.750 --> 19:49.166
You said 1,500 when I walked in here.
It is 1,500.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.250
Before I knew you were desperate.

19:51.333 --> 19:53.041
That's everything I have.

19:54.875 --> 19:57.708
Well, I think you have something else.

19:59.875 --> 20:01.625
Are those Jordans?

20:04.125 --> 20:05.166
What size?

20:27.500 --> 20:29.541
Hey. Hey, Pickle. How you doing?

20:29.625 --> 20:31.166
Dad, are we moving?

20:31.250 --> 20:33.375
-Are we what?
-Are we moving?

20:33.458 --> 20:35.458
No. No. What makes you think that?

20:35.541 --> 20:37.875
Mom says I might have
to start a new school.

20:37.958 --> 20:39.708
That's what Mom says, huh?

20:39.791 --> 20:44.541
Well, you know Mom is a jokester,
and I love her to death, but…

20:47.208 --> 20:48.833
But we're not going anywhere.

20:49.333 --> 20:50.833
You're not going anywhere, okay?

20:50.916 --> 20:53.250
Okay, good. Thanks, Daddy.

20:53.333 --> 20:54.958
-I love you.
-I love you too!

21:12.333 --> 21:13.458
I need you, bro.

21:21.166 --> 21:24.750
We have already agreed
to take delivery of the product

21:24.833 --> 21:27.375
and to help with placement in Simi Valley.

21:27.958 --> 21:30.416
You had no authority to take out Sasha.

21:30.916 --> 21:33.083
I'm going to have to rethink our deal.

21:33.666 --> 21:36.625
Sasha is the past,
and I am the future.

21:37.125 --> 21:39.000
We already own the night,

21:39.666 --> 21:42.291
but my product
will allow us to seize the day.

21:42.791 --> 21:44.333
So here is your choice.

21:44.416 --> 21:50.000
You join me, and we take over the Valley,
or you can join him. Comprendes?

22:23.291 --> 22:25.875
My precious…

22:52.916 --> 22:54.500
It's just one man.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.208
I can still smell him.

23:19.500 --> 23:20.750
Find him.

23:44.583 --> 23:47.958
♪ I may be a fool with my money
But don't call me broke ♪

23:48.666 --> 23:52.041

Big J, you ain't changed a bit, baby.
I see you. What's happening?

24:22.375 --> 24:24.208
You know me,
cutting necks and cashing checks.

24:24.291 --> 24:25.625
Yeah. Thanks for meeting me, man.

24:25.708 --> 24:29.083
Least I can do for the player that
snatched my ass out the sandbox twice.

24:29.166 --> 24:30.000
How's Seeger?

24:31.041 --> 24:31.916
Same.

24:32.458 --> 24:33.291
-Or worse.
-Damn.

24:33.375 --> 24:34.541
You think he'll listen?

24:35.041 --> 24:37.916
-Things have changed since you left.
-I ain't never left, Big J.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.250
Well, since you got
your ass kicked out the Union.

24:40.333 --> 24:43.583
Look here. I'm putting my name and my ass
on the line by vouching for you.

24:43.666 --> 24:45.083
Can you play this shit by the books?

24:45.166 --> 24:48.250
I got to. I got to get that Union card,
or I'm gonna lose my family.

24:48.333 --> 24:50.583
Look, I need ten large
in the next five days,

24:50.666 --> 24:52.666
or Joss is gonna take Paige
down to Florida.

24:52.750 --> 24:53.583
That's bad.

24:53.666 --> 24:56.375
The Union is the only place
gonna give me that kind of coin.

24:56.458 --> 24:58.583
-I got you. Lock and load.
-All right.

24:59.208 --> 25:01.750
She's done this before, man.
Pump faking, whatever.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.458
But right now, it seems like it's real.

25:06.833 --> 25:08.875
Hi, Momoko!

25:10.208 --> 25:12.000
How are you?

25:13.166 --> 25:14.083
Momoko.

25:15.541 --> 25:16.416
Yes?

25:17.291 --> 25:19.708
Pink penguin puffy pants.

25:24.291 --> 25:26.291
See you ain't missed a step, Big J.

25:46.833 --> 25:48.791
JJ Perry to the trade counter.

25:48.875 --> 25:51.541
-Wow.
-JJ Perry to the trade counter.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.416
I don't know how I feel about this.

26:02.208 --> 26:04.291
Things really done changed
around here, huh?

26:04.375 --> 26:07.541
Yeah, we ain't just 818 no more.
We done went international.

26:07.625 --> 26:09.666
Look, Paris even blowing up tonight.

26:09.750 --> 26:10.666
Hmm.

26:11.791 --> 26:13.208
Bet money's good out there.

26:14.083 --> 26:16.000
Let's go and get this thing over with.

26:18.291 --> 26:19.416
How's the shirt look?

26:20.458 --> 26:23.375
Stop being nervous, man.
Pull yourself together.

26:28.375 --> 26:29.583
Hey, Big John.

26:29.666 --> 26:30.833
Well, hello, sunshine.

26:30.916 --> 26:34.208
He's expecting you,
but he's in one of his moods today.

26:51.208 --> 26:53.458
I took this meeting
out of respect for you, Big John.

26:53.541 --> 26:56.166
God knows I wouldn't be
sitting here without your support.

26:57.250 --> 27:00.416
But, uh, I'm certain we all remember

27:00.500 --> 27:04.583
that Mr. Jablonski's previous tenure
as a Union member was…

27:05.916 --> 27:07.458
chock-full of incidents.

27:08.375 --> 27:10.500
Let's just take a look.

27:12.250 --> 27:16.541
Northridge, 2014, violated code 103.

27:16.625 --> 27:20.041
Encino, 2015, fleshed out a nest

27:20.125 --> 27:23.666
while a child's birthday party
was unfolding next door,

27:24.666 --> 27:29.166
endangering civilians,
violating codes 921, 833, and 605,

27:29.250 --> 27:33.250
the worst of which was the failure
to notify law enforcement in due time.

27:33.333 --> 27:36.583
-That was a good bust. What happened was--
-And to top it all off…

27:37.291 --> 27:40.125
Canoga Park, 2017,

27:40.625 --> 27:45.166
violated code 101,
endangering a fellow Union member's life.

27:46.250 --> 27:49.458
Critical injury sustained.

27:49.541 --> 27:52.166
He already had g… gout. He had gout.

27:52.250 --> 27:56.791
Each of these incidents…
meriting a lifelong suspension.

27:57.541 --> 28:02.333
And yet, time and again,
you were given warnings.

28:02.416 --> 28:06.958
Why should I extend you
yet another lifeline?

28:07.041 --> 28:09.583
Ralph, let me be the first to tell you.

28:10.208 --> 28:12.708
-Bud here, he's a new man.
-Yeah.

28:12.791 --> 28:13.958
Is that right?

28:14.041 --> 28:16.333
Yes, sir. Absolutely. I'm a changed man.

28:16.416 --> 28:18.708
I've cut out, uh…

28:18.791 --> 28:22.916
pork and cartoons and minimal white women.

28:23.875 --> 28:25.625
Bud, I'm curious. Uh…

28:26.208 --> 28:27.833
If you were in my position,

28:27.916 --> 28:31.125
sitting across
from a man such as yourself,

28:32.166 --> 28:35.791
would you let you back in?

28:35.875 --> 28:39.833
If that person
that is in question admits fault

28:40.416 --> 28:42.625
and be apologetic, which I am, and,

28:43.291 --> 28:44.416
on top of that, I just…

28:46.833 --> 28:48.000
Look, Ralph…

28:48.666 --> 28:49.958
Mr. Seeger, I just…

28:50.541 --> 28:53.375
I really need to get out there.
I need to do good.

28:53.458 --> 28:55.541
I promise,
if you give me that opportunity,

28:55.625 --> 28:57.166
I'm not gonna mess it up.

29:04.125 --> 29:05.541
One last chance.

29:06.166 --> 29:08.291
Now that we, uh, got that part settled,

29:08.375 --> 29:12.708
I'm gonna go freshen up my coffee
and let you gentlemen cross those T's.

29:14.083 --> 29:16.500
That's a great guy. Great guy.

29:17.500 --> 29:19.375
Really appreciate this second chance.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.750
I don't know what the hell
that man sees in you, Jablonski.

29:23.500 --> 29:27.541
I mean, I know you served together,
but, frankly, I don't care.

29:29.291 --> 29:32.458
I've made it my life's work
keeping cowboys like you out of the Union,

29:32.541 --> 29:34.208
so I'll be watching you.

29:35.208 --> 29:37.375
♪ Every step you make ♪

29:38.291 --> 29:40.250
♪ Every shit you take ♪

29:40.750 --> 29:42.791
-♪ Every time you-- ♪
-Everything good?

29:44.083 --> 29:45.916
Quite.

29:47.500 --> 29:49.125
Fill these out, all of them.

29:50.083 --> 29:52.250
Once you pay your initial dues,

29:52.333 --> 29:54.125
we'll get you started
on the health care plan.

29:54.208 --> 29:55.458
There's dental included, right?

29:55.541 --> 29:58.208
After a probationary period lasting…

29:59.333 --> 30:00.500
30 days.

30:00.583 --> 30:02.958
Come on, man. Three days.

30:03.625 --> 30:04.583
Two weeks.

30:04.666 --> 30:06.625
-One.

30:08.208 --> 30:09.083
Fine.

30:09.750 --> 30:13.708
With a Union rep
accompanying him in the field.

30:13.791 --> 30:15.583
-Generous. Thank you.
-Great.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.041
All right. Thanks, and, uh…

30:19.125 --> 30:21.166
…I want the night shift.

30:21.833 --> 30:24.083
-Not on my life.
-Come on, Seeger.

30:24.166 --> 30:26.625
-That's where the big money is!
-No. Not a chance.

30:26.708 --> 30:28.791
Amount of shit
you stirred up working night shift,

30:28.875 --> 30:31.791
you expect me to let you
back out there where the sun don't shine?

30:32.291 --> 30:33.166
Fine.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.375
Day shift.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.458
Good. Anything else?

30:38.083 --> 30:38.958
No.

30:39.041 --> 30:43.041
Oh, yeah. I got some,
uh, teeth I need to sell.

30:43.125 --> 30:44.041
Go to the cage.

30:44.125 --> 30:46.166
Seeger, thank you kindly.

30:46.250 --> 30:47.250
Mm-hmm.

30:47.791 --> 30:49.083
And remember, Bud,

30:50.416 --> 30:51.750
one last strike.

30:53.458 --> 30:55.666
Is… Are you referring to bowling, because…

30:56.833 --> 31:00.291
-I'm saying there's a strike in bowl--
-You're back. That's all that matters.

31:12.875 --> 31:13.791
Carol.

31:14.875 --> 31:16.666
Carol, did you eat my yogurt again?

31:18.208 --> 31:20.000
I even wrote my name on the lid today,

31:20.083 --> 31:23.750
so you literally had to peel back
my name to get to the yogurt.

31:25.291 --> 31:26.750
Oh, what? You can't hear me?

31:28.750 --> 31:31.208
I'm gonna fart in my yogurt,
and you're gonna eat my fart.

31:31.291 --> 31:32.416
Next.

31:36.541 --> 31:37.916
Mr. Jablonski?

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Yeah. Teeth.

31:39.083 --> 31:42.708
So I look at it like this.
I get back out there, do what I gotta do,

31:44.250 --> 31:45.916
you know, for Mr. Mullet.

31:48.125 --> 31:50.625
This is chipped, female.

31:51.875 --> 31:55.291
Appears to be an almost Elder,
roughly 90 years old.

31:55.375 --> 31:57.125
Ninety? You probably need
to check that again.

31:57.208 --> 31:59.125
-You sure it's 90?
-I'm sure.

31:59.208 --> 32:00.041
Huh.

32:00.916 --> 32:02.541
Okay, whatever.

32:03.416 --> 32:04.666
Full price still, right?

32:04.750 --> 32:07.250
I'm sorry. Code 107 in the book
clearly states anything--

32:07.333 --> 32:09.166
Enough of the codes. It's fine.

32:16.166 --> 32:19.000
-That's the net for the teeth.
-Yeah, I'll come in… Hey!

32:19.791 --> 32:22.666
However, due to
the truncated processing time,

32:22.750 --> 32:25.750
Mr. Seeger would like me to inform you
we need your dues up front,

32:25.833 --> 32:27.375
which, of course, is $5,000.

32:27.458 --> 32:28.875
$5,000? I thought it was two?

32:28.958 --> 32:31.291
Those are 2017 rates, Mr. Jablonski.

32:31.375 --> 32:35.166
Then there is 15%
off the top of every fang,

32:35.250 --> 32:39.833
and we have to hold 50%
until we receive your paperwork.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.916
And, of course, $10
for your membership card,

32:43.000 --> 32:45.083
which gets you one free app
at Cheesecake Factory.

32:45.166 --> 32:46.958
-I don't like cheesecake.
-Do you have that?

32:47.041 --> 32:49.541
Why won't you take the $10 out of that?
Taking everything else.

32:49.625 --> 32:52.083
You don't have cash on you?
You really wanna make me split this?

32:55.958 --> 32:57.958
Okay, you are good to go.

32:58.041 --> 32:58.958
Am I?

33:01.041 --> 33:02.916
If you have any issues with this,

33:03.000 --> 33:05.500
Carol right here would be happy
to further assist you.

33:05.583 --> 33:08.291
Oh, great. I see you met your Union rep.

33:08.833 --> 33:09.875
Huh.

33:09.958 --> 33:10.916
What?

33:14.041 --> 33:15.125
Come on, Bud.

33:18.708 --> 33:19.625
Sir, please.

33:19.708 --> 33:21.541
That new girl's a smoke show.

33:21.625 --> 33:24.916
Right, but I'm begging you to reconsider.
I'm not meant for the field.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.541
I just bought an ergonomic chair
with my own money. I'm all in on the desk.

33:28.625 --> 33:30.458
That's why I need you out there with him.

33:30.541 --> 33:32.500
Right? Someone who knows
the codes to the letter.

33:32.583 --> 33:33.750
-Okay, but--
-Hey, hey, hey.

33:33.833 --> 33:35.375
Do you wanna move up here?

33:35.458 --> 33:37.750
You gotta get your ass
out in the field. All right?

33:37.833 --> 33:38.833
Think about it this way,

33:38.916 --> 33:40.833
you're gonna be
my eyes and ears, my friend.

33:40.916 --> 33:41.750
-Right?
-Right--

33:41.833 --> 33:45.416
And the minute he messes up,
the minute he goes against code,

33:46.333 --> 33:49.333
you'll be there
reporting it back to me, right?

33:50.333 --> 33:51.916
The sooner he fucks up,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.791
the sooner
your sweet cheeks are in Carol's desk.

33:58.208 --> 33:59.208
You work out?

34:00.416 --> 34:02.500
-A little.
-Yeah, thought so.

34:38.041 --> 34:40.625
I was actually here an hour ago,
but you weren't,

34:40.708 --> 34:42.416
so I went to go get us breakfast.

34:47.166 --> 34:49.833
I got you an organic,
gluten-free, paleo bran muffin.

34:50.416 --> 34:52.208
Really? Thank you.

34:53.250 --> 34:55.666
-I was starving.
-That was a six-dollar muffin.

34:55.750 --> 34:57.541
-What do you have on?
-What?

34:57.625 --> 35:00.125
-What are you wearing?
-Just, like, normal clothes.

35:00.208 --> 35:02.791
The handbook says blend in on the hunt.
Be inconspicuous.

35:02.875 --> 35:05.125
You have on a suit.
How's that inconspicuous?

35:05.208 --> 35:07.541
You have on a suit.
We're in the Valley. In the summertime.

35:07.625 --> 35:09.375
-It's a summery suit.
-A summery suit?

35:09.458 --> 35:11.541
-Juniper green. Yes.
-What is juniper green?

35:11.625 --> 35:14.416
A hue of green I found to be complementary
against my skin tone.

35:14.500 --> 35:16.458
Whatever it is, don't wear it again.

35:17.750 --> 35:21.291
Look, I'll put myself together,
and we'll take off, all right?

35:22.333 --> 35:24.541
-Do you have somewhere I can hang this?
-Yep.

35:27.958 --> 35:29.000
Not there.

35:35.541 --> 35:37.458
I'll just… hold on to it.

35:38.458 --> 35:39.791
This ain't gonna last.

35:49.625 --> 35:52.583
Got enough weapons and ammo in here
to take down El Jefe, huh?

35:52.666 --> 35:54.625
What you know about El Jefe?

35:54.708 --> 35:58.625
Oh, come on.
Legendary 700-year-old European vampire.

35:58.708 --> 36:00.541
Some say he's
at the top of the LA drug trade,

36:00.625 --> 36:02.500
just waiting for his moment to reemerge.

36:02.583 --> 36:05.583
Fangs so sharp, with just one,
you could buy a mansion in Bel Air.

36:05.666 --> 36:06.791
Hmm.

36:06.875 --> 36:08.333
You sound like Big John.

36:09.250 --> 36:12.750
Whole lot of gibberish.
You know that's a crock of shit, right?

36:16.625 --> 36:18.333
I didn't take you for
an arts and crafts guy.

36:18.416 --> 36:20.958
-What are these all about?
-Wanna keep your hands off my shit?

36:22.208 --> 36:23.625
It's my trophy case.

36:23.708 --> 36:25.500
For each one that I kill, I, uh…

36:25.583 --> 36:27.208
They're already dead,
but you get my drift.

36:35.041 --> 36:36.708
'Cause they're allergic to wood. Smart.

36:36.791 --> 36:39.500
They're allergic to wood,
but not just any wood. It's mpingo wood.

36:39.583 --> 36:42.500
The strongest African hardwood.
Not that Ikea shit.

36:42.583 --> 36:45.416
We mix it with the garlic.
The wooden bullets pierce the heart.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.125
-The silver--
-Silver to the throat. Right.

36:47.208 --> 36:50.083
Yeah. Cuts the head off… usually.

36:50.166 --> 36:52.541
Usually. Right, you are
referring to Uber Vamps,

36:52.625 --> 36:54.333
who have come back from decapitation.

36:54.416 --> 36:57.916
Not if you blast the heart with wood
before you cut their throats with silver.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.208
Mm-hmm. You also forgot to mention
that you can kill them by burning them.

37:01.708 --> 37:03.791
I didn't forget anything.
That's how I get my money.

37:03.875 --> 37:05.833
Why would I burn the fangs?
I don't do that.

37:06.375 --> 37:08.000
Listen, Guacamole Suit,

37:08.583 --> 37:11.000
right there on the shelf,
grab that for me.

37:11.083 --> 37:13.000
Get that, we'll take off.

37:13.083 --> 37:15.625
And remember, whatever you do, don't…

37:16.750 --> 37:17.916

37:21.791 --> 37:23.500
So, uh, where we going?

I mean, usually the seat belts aren't

37:45.541 --> 37:48.583
It's not complicated.
It's just a seat belt. It protects you.

38:15.291 --> 38:16.541
I'm gonna tell you shit.

38:21.291 --> 38:22.708
What you know about Juvies?

38:23.583 --> 38:26.291
Juvies or Juveniles, AKA Zombie Vamps,

38:26.375 --> 38:29.166
formed when an already young vamp
turns somebody else.

38:29.250 --> 38:31.083
Instead of the strength of a full vamp,

38:31.166 --> 38:34.083
they lack regenerative abilities
and appear more dead than alive.

38:34.166 --> 38:36.833
They can't process human blood yet,
so what do they do?

38:36.916 --> 38:39.291
-I'm aware.
-They feed off of small animals, rodents.

38:39.375 --> 38:40.541
So you've read the book?

38:40.625 --> 38:42.375
I don't have to read it. I'm out here.

38:42.458 --> 38:45.083
What do you know
about different species of vampires?

38:45.791 --> 38:47.291
I know there are five types.

38:47.375 --> 38:49.625
Southern, Eastern,
Spider, Uber, and Juvenile.

38:49.708 --> 38:52.916
They are largely solitary,
but when together, there is a hierarchy.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.791
They organize by age. What else?

38:54.875 --> 38:56.750
The sunlight is the only thing
they're scared of.

38:56.833 --> 38:58.875
They can't reproduce,
but they can turn people.

38:58.958 --> 38:59.833
Should I continue?

39:00.333 --> 39:02.541
-What about familiars?
-You think this guy's one of them?

39:02.625 --> 39:04.125
I don't know. You tell me.

39:05.208 --> 39:07.333
-Hmm?
-I think he fits the profile.

39:07.416 --> 39:08.666
-You think so?
-Absolutely.

39:08.750 --> 39:10.958
More powerful vamps
have more powerful familiars.

39:11.041 --> 39:13.500
And when it comes to Juvies,
a little kid like this,

39:13.583 --> 39:16.791
he's probably grabbing those cats for 'em,
try to get 'em turned.

39:19.250 --> 39:20.583
-Oh man.
-What?

39:21.458 --> 39:24.875
No, I'm just a big cat lover.
I got two of them myself.

39:24.958 --> 39:26.250
Oh. Okay.

39:26.333 --> 39:27.791
Well, that explains it.

39:27.875 --> 39:29.666
-Want to see a picture?
-No, I don't.

39:30.166 --> 39:31.000
Maybe later.

39:34.125 --> 39:35.958
All right. Here we go.

39:42.125 --> 39:43.250
There's his car.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.958
Canoga Bowl. Closed for 18 months.

39:56.708 --> 39:57.666
It's perfect.

39:58.666 --> 40:00.125
-Can I offer some advice?
-No.

40:00.208 --> 40:03.333
I mean, economically speaking,
why go after Juvies?

40:03.416 --> 40:05.875
Why not let them ripen,
come back when their teeth are valuable?

40:05.958 --> 40:09.041
I could come back in September,
but right now, I'm out of time.

40:09.125 --> 40:10.458
And beggars can't be choosers.

40:10.541 --> 40:13.083
Plus, you don't want
these things biting people, do you?

40:14.208 --> 40:15.416
Wait. Why don't you have time?

40:16.333 --> 40:18.208
-Why you ask me so many questions?
-I'm just--

40:18.291 --> 40:19.958
Just stay in the truck
and do your business.

40:20.041 --> 40:23.333
Stay in the truck? No, I have to be
with you at all times in the field.

40:23.416 --> 40:25.166
-Union rules.
-Other than keeping you alive,

40:25.250 --> 40:26.500
I don't give a shit about rules.

40:26.583 --> 40:28.791
No, no, you don't understand. All times.

40:28.875 --> 40:31.125
You're gonna stay in this car.
With that in mind, here.

40:31.208 --> 40:34.500
-What? No, I don't believe in guns.
-You don't believe in 'em?

40:34.583 --> 40:36.458
No, they're amoral.
They're killing machines.

40:36.541 --> 40:37.583
They're not for me.

40:39.375 --> 40:42.041
When I was a kid,
I tried shooting a squirrel with a BB gun,

40:42.125 --> 40:43.541
and I just couldn't. All right?

40:43.625 --> 40:46.041
I still have nightmares
where I can see his little face

40:46.125 --> 40:49.625
making little squirrel noises,
and I still have nightmares about it.

40:49.708 --> 40:51.041
Made squirrel noises, huh?

40:51.125 --> 40:53.500
-What does a squirrel noise sound like?
-It's like…

40:57.541 --> 40:59.166
Whatever! I don't wanna talk about it.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.583
Stay in the truck.

41:35.458 --> 41:36.833
It's impossible.

41:37.625 --> 41:39.541
How the hell can you be here?

41:39.625 --> 41:40.791
It's daytime.

41:42.625 --> 41:44.666
You've been a bad boy, Troy.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.958
Did you know that a vampire
cannot live without its fangs?

42:01.083 --> 42:05.416
And yet, for whatever reason,
whatever cruel joke from the gods…

42:07.958 --> 42:10.625
they are the one thing
we cannot regenerate.

42:13.916 --> 42:17.000
Everything that makes a vampire a predator

42:18.541 --> 42:19.500
is in its fangs.

42:21.625 --> 42:26.833
Each set is a life
that could have lived a thousand lives.

42:30.333 --> 42:32.750
Lives that you had a part in ending.

42:38.708 --> 42:41.333
Yet it wasn't always like this, you know?

42:42.000 --> 42:47.625
There was a time when you humans,
you worshiped us as gods.

42:47.708 --> 42:51.708
Right here in this valley, you built
temples of blood and bone to honor us.

42:52.375 --> 42:54.500
And then you turned on us.

42:55.333 --> 42:57.916
Well, guess what?

42:59.125 --> 43:01.625
I'm gonna take back what's ours,

43:02.666 --> 43:05.958
one property at a time.

43:08.291 --> 43:12.416
The way I see it,
you have two choices, two doors.

43:12.500 --> 43:16.333
One, you bend the knee
and join me in service, and you live.

43:16.416 --> 43:17.666
And two…

43:19.375 --> 43:20.291
you don't.

43:21.916 --> 43:25.625
All right.
So, what the hell do you want? Huh?

43:27.041 --> 43:28.791
Who brought you this tooth?

43:32.791 --> 43:33.875
A name.

43:35.750 --> 43:37.791
You're so full of shit, lady.

43:38.833 --> 43:40.541
You think you're a god?

43:40.625 --> 43:42.958
You're not gods. You're a big mistake.

43:43.041 --> 43:47.500
You're a genetic mutation
that would've died out

43:47.583 --> 43:51.541
if there hadn't been a stinking hole
for y'all to crawl into.

43:52.083 --> 43:53.375
Door number two it is.

43:54.125 --> 43:55.916
No. No!

43:56.000 --> 43:58.625

44:47.083 --> 44:48.583

47:15.625 --> 47:18.166
In the morning,
we'll kick some motherfucking ass. Okay?

47:18.250 --> 47:20.083
-Okay.
-All right, come on.

47:20.166 --> 47:21.500
Let's get in the car.

47:21.583 --> 47:23.875
What the fuck is that?
What'd you eat today?

47:24.500 --> 47:25.541
You know what?

47:26.500 --> 47:28.000
Let's have you get in the back.

47:28.083 --> 47:30.250
Don't want you
to get that on my vintage seats.

47:30.333 --> 47:32.291
-What, are you serious?
-Damn right.

47:32.875 --> 47:34.458
Come on. Gotta move.

47:41.750 --> 47:44.833
Hang your leg out the back
so we can air dry.

48:04.041 --> 48:05.625
Hey. Hey!

48:06.375 --> 48:08.416
-You forgot your man-purse.
-Wait. That's expens--

48:10.166 --> 48:11.833
You gotta get some of this too.

48:12.458 --> 48:14.791
I'm sure you know, Mr. Union Man.
But when vamps are killed,

48:14.875 --> 48:18.166
they release a gas that gets on you
that other vamps can sniff out.

48:18.250 --> 48:21.083
So you gotta get all of that off.
Here, take this.

48:21.166 --> 48:24.500
It's my special blend,
like a little, uh, skunk musk, okay?

48:24.583 --> 48:26.666
-Now, get that on you, in the shower.
-Oh Jesus.

48:26.750 --> 48:28.250
On every inch of you, okay?

48:28.333 --> 48:30.833
Be extremely careful.
Don't get it in your eyes.

48:30.916 --> 48:32.083
And whatever you do,

48:33.041 --> 48:34.291
don't get it in your butthole.

48:34.375 --> 48:35.750
What happens in the butthole?

48:35.833 --> 48:37.833
I mean, it can't kill you, but…

48:38.500 --> 48:39.458
Jesus Christ.

48:40.250 --> 48:43.416
By the way, lock your doors,
don't come out after dark, and, uh…

48:44.333 --> 48:45.875
-Guess what?
-What?

48:45.958 --> 48:47.041
You're dried up.

49:27.875 --> 49:28.708
Oh!

49:28.791 --> 49:31.375
-Oh God. It's okay.
-I'm sorry about that.

49:31.458 --> 49:32.833
-No, no, me. I got it.
-It's okay.

49:32.916 --> 49:34.791
It's my fault.
I couldn't see over my baskets.

49:34.875 --> 49:38.375
I got it. This is a… You a… you a doctor?

49:38.458 --> 49:40.000
Uh, nurse, actually.

49:40.083 --> 49:42.958
Hope you don't think this is weird,
but you got a lot of scrubs.

49:43.041 --> 49:46.875
Yeah, I mean, I hate doing laundry,
so I kind of just kept buying new ones.

49:46.958 --> 49:48.500
-Got out of control.
-Okay.

49:48.583 --> 49:51.083
But, hey, new apartment.
Why not start off on the right foot?

49:51.166 --> 49:55.208
Yeah. Well, welcome to the building.
I'm right there in 20.

49:55.291 --> 49:59.000
-Oh! Well, I'm Heather. I'm in 19.
-Well, I'm Bud 20.

49:59.083 --> 50:00.750
Can you help me with that, actually?

50:00.833 --> 50:01.791
Oh. Yeah.

50:01.875 --> 50:03.291
-Thanks.
-Yeah, no problem.

50:03.375 --> 50:06.333
-You can just put that down anywhere.
-Sure. Okay.

50:07.125 --> 50:11.166
-See you've got a retro vibe poppin', huh?
-Mm-hmm.

50:11.250 --> 50:12.500
-Dig that.
-Thanks.

50:12.583 --> 50:15.500
I wish I had a beer
or something to offer you.

50:15.583 --> 50:19.666
Uh, a previous tenant left some ice cream
in the freezer, if you're interested.

50:19.750 --> 50:21.416
No, thanks. I'll take a rain check.

50:21.500 --> 50:23.583
-You sure?
-Yeah. Welcome to the building.

50:24.166 --> 50:25.166
Thank you.

50:48.166 --> 50:49.166
Feeling better?

50:49.708 --> 50:50.750
Not really.

50:51.250 --> 50:53.833
Got a little bit of that
yellow stuff in my butthole.

50:53.916 --> 50:56.375
It was so much worse
than what you even described.

50:56.458 --> 50:57.541
Bet it was.

51:04.041 --> 51:05.166
You looking for something?

51:05.750 --> 51:07.916
-Whoa. Hey, that's personal.
-No, no, no.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.375
"Violation code 101, terminated vamps
and didn't report to the Union."

51:11.458 --> 51:15.541
"Violation code 276, breaking and entering
without Union sanctions."

51:15.625 --> 51:18.000
-That did happen.
-Violation. Violation. Violation.

51:18.083 --> 51:21.791
Oh, look at this. "Needs to reimburse me
for six-dollar muffin"?

51:21.875 --> 51:23.416
It's a standard part of Union procedure.

51:23.500 --> 51:25.125
-I have to document everything.
-It's not.

51:25.208 --> 51:28.208
It's for Seeger to keep me out the Union.
Ain't that great?

51:28.291 --> 51:29.958
You almost got me killed yesterday.

51:30.041 --> 51:31.916
You almost got yourself killed yesterday.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
I told you stay your punk-ass in the car.
That's why I work by myself.

51:35.083 --> 51:38.458
Listen. What? You're gonna die
in the name of kissing your boss's ass?

51:38.541 --> 51:40.416
Well, he didn't give me a choice, okay?

51:40.500 --> 51:42.416
Listen to me, Mr. Union Fellow.

51:42.500 --> 51:45.583
I may not follow all the Union rules,
but let me tell you something.

51:45.666 --> 51:48.375
If we went by the book,
we'd both be dead by now!

51:49.250 --> 51:50.791
And you saw that yesterday.

52:00.416 --> 52:03.541
Look. Just give me a couple of days.

52:06.375 --> 52:08.000
Okay, a couple days.

52:11.500 --> 52:13.333
So, what's on the agenda today?

52:14.458 --> 52:15.541
Like every day.

52:16.833 --> 52:18.125
Hunting vampires.

52:25.416 --> 52:27.625
Bud, what are we
doing at a pawn shop?

52:27.708 --> 52:31.083
This dude's cheap as shit,
but he got goods we need in order to, uh…

52:31.625 --> 52:32.625
What the hell?

52:39.750 --> 52:40.875
Oh Jesus.

52:40.958 --> 52:42.333
Shut up. Shut up.

52:47.333 --> 52:48.166
Hey, hey.

52:48.750 --> 52:51.958
Don't you puke in here!
Don't touch nothing. Don't leave your DNA.

52:52.041 --> 52:53.125
I swallowed it.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.166
Troy.

52:58.250 --> 52:59.083
Troy?

53:03.833 --> 53:04.833
Damn it.

53:08.500 --> 53:09.583
Wait, is that…

53:10.916 --> 53:11.916
It was.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.875
Oh no.

53:15.125 --> 53:16.416
Who… who does that?

53:19.583 --> 53:20.875
All right, we gotta move.

53:24.041 --> 53:26.041
Wait a minute. Take this.

53:26.125 --> 53:27.000
Ow!

53:27.583 --> 53:28.666
Are you kidding me?

53:28.750 --> 53:31.625
-It's not right, okay. Wait--
-Damn right. How you think he feels, huh?

53:31.708 --> 53:32.666
Come on, let's go.

53:32.750 --> 53:34.833
Wait. You can't leave.
That's against protocol.

53:34.916 --> 53:36.750
We have to call the Union
and wait for them.

53:36.833 --> 53:39.833
-Code 233 says any hunter who encounters…
-Code? I don't give a shit.

53:39.916 --> 53:42.708
…suspicious civilian death
will be under a 30-day suspension--

53:42.791 --> 53:44.541
We don't have 30 days. I don't give fuck!

53:44.625 --> 53:46.875
We gotta leave.
There's other vamps around here. Let's go.

53:46.958 --> 53:48.916
No, no. I'm calling.

53:49.541 --> 53:51.833
Whoa! We have dead humans here.
We have to report this.

53:51.916 --> 53:54.250
That ain't no dead human!
That's my friend!

53:55.375 --> 53:57.666
Listen, I'm not telling you
you cannot report it.

53:57.750 --> 53:59.583
I'm just telling you to delay it.

53:59.666 --> 54:02.291
We'll make an anonymous call to the cops,
and, after 24 hours,

54:02.375 --> 54:04.291
you can make
your funky little report. Let's go!

54:04.375 --> 54:06.708
Why do you care?
What difference does a day make?

54:06.791 --> 54:09.333
I'm gonna lose my family in a day!
That's the difference!

54:09.416 --> 54:10.375
What?

54:10.458 --> 54:14.708
Look, if I don't score some prices
at Union wages by Monday,

54:14.791 --> 54:16.625
my wife and my daughter move to Florida.

54:17.291 --> 54:20.583
That means, if you call Seeger,
I'm gonna lose my family.

54:24.541 --> 54:25.458
I'm… I'm sorry.

54:25.541 --> 54:26.708
Yeah, I bet you are.

54:29.708 --> 54:32.666
So what you're saying
is you… you kinda need me.

54:32.750 --> 54:33.583
But…

54:34.083 --> 54:36.458
No, I didn't… I didn't say I need you.
I didn't say that.

54:36.541 --> 54:38.250
-No, I just mean…
-I didn't say that.

54:38.333 --> 54:41.083
You told me your secrets.
I'm gonna break protocol for you.

54:41.166 --> 54:43.625
-So we're like a team, partners, whatever.
-I didn't say partners.

54:43.708 --> 54:45.041
-Crockett and Tubbs.
-No.

54:45.125 --> 54:47.458
-Any partnership you find satisfactory.
-Listen.

54:47.541 --> 54:49.166
What I'm saying is this,

54:49.250 --> 54:52.500
is as a man,
just give me till the weekend.

54:54.583 --> 54:56.708
Yeah, okay. Until the weekend.

54:57.875 --> 54:58.875
Yeah.

55:03.208 --> 55:07.291
Look. What do you want me to do?
If I keep… he's gonna suspect something.

55:07.375 --> 55:08.958
Just relax.

55:39.291 --> 55:41.416
I got a tip on this house
from Big J.

55:42.541 --> 55:44.541
Why don't you
check the glove box right now?

55:46.750 --> 55:47.708
Yeah.

55:47.791 --> 55:49.916
That's what we're doing right there.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.166
That's what we doing.

55:51.791 --> 55:53.208
These… garlic grenades.

55:53.291 --> 55:56.000
Pull the pin, garlic and sawdust
comes out, clears the room.

55:56.708 --> 55:58.875
I think. Haven't actually had to use it.

55:58.958 --> 56:01.083
But, in theory,
that's what's gonna happen.

56:01.666 --> 56:03.875
An unproven weapon
for my first real vampire fight.

56:03.958 --> 56:05.541
-That's wonderful. Thank you.
-Shit. Shit!

56:05.625 --> 56:06.625
What? What?

56:06.708 --> 56:08.125
Goddamn Nazarian Brothers.

56:08.708 --> 56:12.000
Wait, the Nazarian brothers.
Oh, they're big-time hunters.

56:12.083 --> 56:13.833
Yeah, not bigger than me though.

56:15.500 --> 56:18.333
They cleared out all of Glendale.
Now they're headed west.

56:21.500 --> 56:23.458
-Hey, Bud.

56:23.541 --> 56:25.000
I thought I smelled chlorine.

56:25.083 --> 56:27.791
Funny. Thought I smelled shit.

56:29.250 --> 56:31.000
-Who's the cupcake?
-Seth.

56:31.083 --> 56:34.708
I'm his Union rep. But you can
call me Cupcake or whatever you prefer.

56:34.791 --> 56:37.541
-I'm a big fan, by the way.
-Want to get a selfie for your Instagram?

56:39.333 --> 56:41.083
What you guys doing in Simi Valley?

56:41.166 --> 56:42.916
You know what we're doing here, bro.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.875
We let you do the hard part for us,

56:44.958 --> 56:47.583
figure out which house
is hiding the goods, then, you know.

56:47.666 --> 56:50.125
You got me twisted.
I did the work, but I ain't do it for you.

56:50.208 --> 56:52.083
Oh, come on, Bud. Think about it.

56:52.583 --> 56:56.208
Waste a week waiting for the right moment
that we just might take from you?

56:56.291 --> 56:58.083
Or we run up there in force right now.

56:58.166 --> 57:00.666
Sack the place together.
Split the money down the middle.

57:00.750 --> 57:03.541
Well, one, ain't nobody
taking shit from me.

57:04.791 --> 57:05.791
And two…

57:12.250 --> 57:14.625
Yeah. It's a good idea.

57:16.541 --> 57:18.625
-Wanna get a selfie?

57:19.125 --> 57:21.375
Right now? Is that appropriate?

57:21.458 --> 57:23.500
-We can wait--
-That's not appropriate at all.

57:24.916 --> 57:27.333
-What's this?
-Keep your neck from getting chewed out.

57:28.541 --> 57:30.958
Take this. Stay behind me.
I keep you alive.

57:31.041 --> 57:33.583
Don't shoot where they are.
Shoot where they're gonna be.

57:34.791 --> 57:36.541

58:29.958 --> 58:31.333
Bro, you got any more gum?

58:35.625 --> 58:38.541
-You always share that with your brother?
-We share everything.

58:42.250 --> 58:44.333
D, you're supposed
to pry that shit open, not smash it.

58:44.416 --> 58:46.333
Hey. Are we inside the house or not, bro?

58:47.833 --> 58:49.125
Don't even think about it.

58:57.291 --> 58:58.666
-Got him.

59:01.500 --> 59:03.000
Nice shot, bro.

59:03.083 --> 59:04.291
Time to get paid.

59:04.375 --> 59:05.458
Open up.

59:09.416 --> 59:10.666
I told him not to do it.

59:14.208 --> 59:15.375
-Really?
-I'm sorry.

59:15.458 --> 59:16.750
-Put that gun down.
-Okay.

59:16.833 --> 59:18.791
-Take your finger off the trigger.
-Right. Okay.

59:18.875 --> 59:20.125
Just watch my six.

59:20.208 --> 59:21.958
Six… Uh…

59:40.708 --> 59:42.000
-It's a hive.
-What?

59:44.458 --> 59:45.666
Showtime, bro.

1:00:10.791 --> 1:00:11.916
Head on out.

1:00:13.458 --> 1:00:14.291
Bitch-ass.

1:00:26.041 --> 1:00:29.083
Keep your head on a swivel, all right?
And stay away from the walls.

1:00:29.166 --> 1:00:31.458
-Oh shit! Bud!

1:00:34.333 --> 1:00:36.208
Bud! I don't… What do I do?

1:00:36.791 --> 1:00:38.416
Ah! You gotta stop wiggling!

1:00:39.166 --> 1:00:40.666
Oh no!

1:00:40.750 --> 1:00:41.833
No!

1:00:41.916 --> 1:00:43.916
-Oh shit! The gun's broken!

1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.416
-Take the safety off!
-Help, Bud! My gun's not working.

1:00:46.500 --> 1:00:48.833
Oh, come on!

1:00:58.708 --> 1:00:59.750
Oh God!

1:01:00.291 --> 1:01:01.958
Ah!

1:01:04.166 --> 1:01:05.000
Ah!

1:01:18.791 --> 1:01:20.666
Buckshot mouthwash, baby.

1:01:22.666 --> 1:01:25.000
Nice, bro. Yes.

1:01:25.083 --> 1:01:26.250
I got six.

1:01:26.333 --> 1:01:28.250
You got six. I got five.
I'll catch you up.

1:01:36.708 --> 1:01:40.000
Oh shit! Bud, help me!

1:01:43.416 --> 1:01:46.125
-Wait, hold up! Wait, hold on! Ah!

1:01:54.333 --> 1:01:55.666
Don't let it bite you, Seth!

1:02:00.500 --> 1:02:01.833
Haircut time, bro.

1:02:05.541 --> 1:02:06.666
I'm out!

1:02:19.500 --> 1:02:20.333
Ah!

1:02:50.958 --> 1:02:53.500
Bud, help me! Bud, help!

1:02:53.583 --> 1:02:55.708
This motherfucker threw me up the stairs?

1:02:55.791 --> 1:02:56.750
-Ah!

1:03:08.208 --> 1:03:09.875
Bro, send one!

1:03:26.291 --> 1:03:27.458
No good!

1:03:27.958 --> 1:03:29.333
Nice work, bro.

1:03:29.416 --> 1:03:31.375
Help! Help me!

1:03:42.708 --> 1:03:44.791
-Seth, my shotgun!

1:04:03.375 --> 1:04:05.583
-Big money, baby.
-Huh? This is what I was talking about.

1:04:05.666 --> 1:04:07.250
-This was good, yes?
-Very good.

1:04:07.833 --> 1:04:09.708
What happened to you? You piss your pants?

1:04:13.125 --> 1:04:14.166
It's kinda my thing.

1:04:14.250 --> 1:04:16.750
-Bro.
-What you doing? What're you doing?

1:04:16.833 --> 1:04:19.125
Listen, pee-pee pants,
this is man's world, not little boy.

1:04:19.208 --> 1:04:22.541
Gonna get you a Pamper.
Anyway, listen. Be safe, man. Okay?

1:04:22.625 --> 1:04:26.375
I'mma take this and put it
towards my baby girl's tuition, you know?

1:04:26.458 --> 1:04:28.125
That's why I'm out here. You know…

1:04:28.208 --> 1:04:29.416
Familiar on the run.

1:04:29.500 --> 1:04:30.333
I got it.

1:04:34.875 --> 1:04:37.041
-He's up again. That was vampire.
-I know.

1:04:37.125 --> 1:04:38.083
Streets done changed.

1:04:38.166 --> 1:04:40.333
I hear they got this sunscreen
that they put on.

1:04:40.416 --> 1:04:44.458
It's real thick, and they can now last
out in the sunlight like 15, 20 minutes.

1:04:44.541 --> 1:04:46.916
You know it's made
from the shell of desert tortoise.

1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:48.875
It's illegal in 40 countries, right, bro?

1:04:48.958 --> 1:04:51.500
Vampire sunscreen? The Valley?
I don't like the sound of this.

1:04:51.583 --> 1:04:53.708
-Hey, wait, this doesn't make sense.
-'Sup?

1:04:54.208 --> 1:04:57.041
Okay, that's a Spider, but that's an Uber.

1:04:57.125 --> 1:04:58.916
Those are Southerns, and…

1:04:59.500 --> 1:05:01.958
Yeah, that's an Eastern.
You can tell by his fangs in the front.

1:05:02.041 --> 1:05:04.833
Ain't Bloods and Crips.
It's the Valley. They cross-pollinate.

1:05:04.916 --> 1:05:07.500
No, these vamps would never
choose to live together.

1:05:08.083 --> 1:05:09.375
Ubers are solo-nesters.

1:05:09.458 --> 1:05:11.875
Spiders cohabitate,
but never with Easterns and Southerns.

1:05:11.958 --> 1:05:14.250
-They'd steal their food.
-Listen to this kid. Huh?

1:05:14.333 --> 1:05:17.416
This joker reads a few books,
he thinks he knows more than the pros.

1:05:17.500 --> 1:05:20.416
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
Kid makes a good point.

1:05:20.500 --> 1:05:21.333
-But…

1:05:22.416 --> 1:05:24.833
But I'm outta time. I gotta go
pick up the little one. Come on.

1:05:24.916 --> 1:05:28.666
Pull these fangs. And why don't you
go to the bathroom and dry off your dick.

1:05:36.208 --> 1:05:37.125
You okay?

1:05:39.375 --> 1:05:40.375
I don't know.

1:05:41.375 --> 1:05:44.666
I just keep thinking about
how all those vampires we just killed

1:05:44.750 --> 1:05:46.458
used to be regular people.

1:05:46.541 --> 1:05:48.458
There you go.

1:05:48.541 --> 1:05:52.208
The old vampires-are-just-like-us routine.

1:05:52.833 --> 1:05:54.000
But they're not, Seth.

1:05:54.583 --> 1:05:58.083
You know what I see when I see a vamp?
Big old dollar signs.

1:05:58.791 --> 1:06:01.250
'Cause all they are
is murderers and liars.

1:06:01.333 --> 1:06:04.416
It ain't Brad Pitt in a leather jacket
and some blood raves.

1:06:04.500 --> 1:06:09.041
It's not Eclipse. It's not New Moon.
It's not Breaking Dawn Part One.

1:06:09.125 --> 1:06:10.500
It ain't like that, all right?

1:06:11.083 --> 1:06:13.708
Why do you know the names
to all the specific Twilight films?

1:06:13.791 --> 1:06:15.791
What's your gripe
with Breaking Dawn Part 2?

1:06:15.875 --> 1:06:18.375
It's the exciting conclusion
of the whole Twilight Saga.

1:06:18.958 --> 1:06:20.833
Wha… Have you seen Part 2?

1:06:20.916 --> 1:06:23.333
Bella has her baby now. It's insane.

1:06:23.416 --> 1:06:26.166
-She had the baby?
-Oh, I wish I was you!

1:06:26.250 --> 1:06:28.875
To experience that the first time.
You're in for a treat.

1:06:28.958 --> 1:06:31.708
My daughter hipped me to all that.
I don't really get into all that.

1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:34.666
But you got something different, Seth.

1:06:34.750 --> 1:06:36.416
You're tougher than you think you are.

1:06:37.958 --> 1:06:38.916
No.

1:06:39.583 --> 1:06:40.458
I'm serious.

1:06:40.541 --> 1:06:42.750
You're just saying that
so I don't report you to Seeger.

1:06:42.833 --> 1:06:46.291
No, I'm not. You got what it takes.
I'm telling you. You have that instinct.

1:06:46.375 --> 1:06:48.166
You could be a real hunter out here.

1:06:48.666 --> 1:06:50.166
Telling you right now.

1:06:50.250 --> 1:06:51.125
Fuck Carol.

1:06:52.458 --> 1:06:53.625
Fuck accounting.

1:06:54.125 --> 1:06:55.375
You could do this.

1:07:06.666 --> 1:07:08.041
-Hey. Hey!
-Hi, Dad!

1:07:08.541 --> 1:07:11.083
-Dad? What happened to "Daddy"?
-Little kids say, "Daddy."

1:07:11.166 --> 1:07:13.125
Oh, is that right? "Dad," huh?

1:07:14.791 --> 1:07:16.125
Everything's changing around here.

1:07:18.750 --> 1:07:20.166
You're late. Again.

1:07:20.250 --> 1:07:21.708
So, what is all this?

1:07:21.791 --> 1:07:25.208
Well, I can't actually sell the house
without putting it on the market.

1:07:26.041 --> 1:07:28.750
Yeah. Last I checked,
it's three days until Monday.

1:07:28.833 --> 1:07:31.166
Come on, Dad.
We're gonna be late to the party.

1:07:31.250 --> 1:07:34.458
You know, I was thinking,
what if we don't go?

1:07:34.541 --> 1:07:37.875
What if we stay here at the house
and eat pizza, some ice cream--

1:07:37.958 --> 1:07:41.750
Bud. No. She's been talking about this
all week. You promised.

1:07:41.833 --> 1:07:45.125
Yeah, well, I just didn't think
it was the right time right now.

1:07:45.208 --> 1:07:46.750
What? Okay, give me a reason why.

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.750
Right. So, Daddy was just kidding.
He was just being weird.

1:07:52.833 --> 1:07:55.375
-Yeah.
-Yeah, you guys are going to a party!

1:07:55.458 --> 1:07:58.458
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.
-See, Daddy was just being strange.

1:07:58.541 --> 1:08:00.291
-Strange, yeah.
-Yeah.

1:08:00.375 --> 1:08:01.625
-Come on.
-Bye.

1:08:01.708 --> 1:08:02.833
-Bye, baby.
-Bye.

I've been looking for you, Bud.

1:08:23.666 --> 1:08:24.666
Who is this?

1:08:24.750 --> 1:08:26.416
Troy spoke so highly of you.

1:08:26.500 --> 1:08:29.500
Your name was the last thing
on his lips when he died.

1:08:30.041 --> 1:08:32.000
You know how this ends, don't you?

1:08:32.875 --> 1:08:33.791
You tell me.

1:08:33.875 --> 1:08:36.083
With you on your knees in front of me,

1:08:36.166 --> 1:08:38.791
begging for the lives
of your wife and your daughter.

1:08:39.291 --> 1:08:42.750
You took something from me, and now
I'm gonna take everything from you.

Aw. Nice. Ha ha. That's so nice.

1:08:59.541 --> 1:09:01.541
We gotta go, baby. That's so nice.

1:09:01.625 --> 1:09:02.750
-Happy birthday.
-Bye, Paige.

1:09:02.833 --> 1:09:03.958
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:09:05.208 --> 1:09:06.458
Up, up, up.

1:09:06.541 --> 1:09:08.916
Look, buckle yourself in, okay?

1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:12.083
Look, in here, all right.
Now let's put your headphones on, okay?

1:09:12.166 --> 1:09:15.416
Got your iPad right here.
Now listen. Dad's gonna be driving.

1:09:15.500 --> 1:09:18.583
You might feel a little swerving,
but that's just my special driving.

1:10:50.041 --> 1:10:51.291
Just pick up, pick up, pick up.

1:10:51.375 --> 1:10:52.916
Can't talk. Meeting a realtor.

1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:54.416
-Don't hang up!
-Why? Is Paige okay?

1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:57.208
-Uh, yeah, she's great, but, uh…

1:10:57.291 --> 1:11:00.083
Look, Joss, we're in trouble, okay?
All of us.

1:11:03.041 --> 1:11:04.666
What? What are you talking about?

1:11:04.750 --> 1:11:06.250
There's a lot I need to tell you.

1:11:06.333 --> 1:11:08.916
I know you've had trouble
trusting me in the past.

1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:12.750
I know you think I keep things from you,
but right now, you gotta trust me.

1:11:12.833 --> 1:11:15.916
-I don't want to lose either of you.
-Now you're freaking me out.

1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:19.208
Pack your bags, be ready to go,
and I will explain everything, okay?

1:11:19.291 --> 1:11:20.500
-A bag?

1:11:20.583 --> 1:11:21.791
All right.

1:11:21.875 --> 1:11:23.791
Hey. You took your headphones off, huh?

1:11:23.875 --> 1:11:26.750
I already won my race.
Besides, looks like you can use my help.

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:29.750
Uh, you're not wrong on that.

1:11:29.833 --> 1:11:31.208
Light!

1:11:36.041 --> 1:11:37.208
-Whoa!

1:11:46.208 --> 1:11:47.458
Car!

1:11:50.083 --> 1:11:51.416
Thank you!

1:12:40.583 --> 1:12:41.916
All right, big jump. Big jump!

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:43.750
Woo-hoo!

1:12:45.875 --> 1:12:47.166
There's a guy on the right!

1:12:59.833 --> 1:13:01.000
Hold on.

1:13:13.666 --> 1:13:14.958
Cover your ears, sweetie.

1:13:40.375 --> 1:13:41.958
That was awesome.

1:13:42.041 --> 1:13:43.916
Yeah? Just don't tell your mother.

1:13:53.375 --> 1:13:55.500
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

1:13:55.583 --> 1:13:58.750
Come on. All right. Come on. Let's run.

1:13:58.833 --> 1:14:01.291
-You ever heard of Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
-Uh, no.

1:14:01.375 --> 1:14:03.125
-I'll show her to you.
-Okay.

1:14:06.166 --> 1:14:09.125
-No! No! No!

1:14:09.208 --> 1:14:11.208
No!

1:14:13.083 --> 1:14:14.583
No, no, no! Stop!

1:14:17.291 --> 1:14:18.333
Hola, Bud.

1:14:18.416 --> 1:14:21.041
I told you you'd be on your knees
begging for their lives.

1:14:21.125 --> 1:14:22.250
It's okay. It's okay.

1:14:22.333 --> 1:14:23.458
So beg.

1:14:23.541 --> 1:14:26.250
-Go to hell.
-Oh, your compadre said the same thing.

1:14:27.791 --> 1:14:30.125
Oh shit. Baby, I'm sorry.

1:14:30.208 --> 1:14:32.375
I'm sorry for this, Joss. Are you okay?

1:14:32.458 --> 1:14:33.333
Yeah.

1:14:33.958 --> 1:14:35.083
What is happening, Bud?

1:14:35.708 --> 1:14:38.416
I could try to explain it right now,
but it's not gonna make any sense.

1:14:39.041 --> 1:14:40.250
-But--
-But what?

1:14:42.375 --> 1:14:44.666
I'm not exactly a pool cleaner.

1:14:45.875 --> 1:14:47.208
Well, then, what are you?

1:14:48.250 --> 1:14:49.083
I…

1:14:50.750 --> 1:14:52.000
hunt vampires.

1:14:53.916 --> 1:14:56.166
-What?
-Yeah. I hunt vampires.

1:14:56.666 --> 1:14:59.416
-Vampires?
-Yeah. That's what I do.

1:14:59.916 --> 1:15:01.166
-Vampires?
-Yeah.

1:15:02.583 --> 1:15:06.416
Okay, so all of the lies, all of
the late-night calls, all of the locks…

1:15:06.500 --> 1:15:07.541
Come on, man.

1:15:07.625 --> 1:15:10.416
The reason I'm separated
from the man I love is vampires? Ow!

1:15:10.500 --> 1:15:11.875
Stop choking her like that!

1:15:12.583 --> 1:15:15.375
Come on, Bud. We said
we were gonna be honest with each other.

1:15:15.458 --> 1:15:16.416
We are.

1:15:18.125 --> 1:15:19.958
-I know. Don't look at it.
-Oh my God!

1:15:20.041 --> 1:15:21.916
-Listen…

1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.166
I wanted to tell you.
I just didn't know how.

1:15:25.750 --> 1:15:27.666
Okay. Okay, so…

1:15:29.125 --> 1:15:30.541
Uh, what do you want?

1:15:30.625 --> 1:15:31.625
What do I want?

1:15:32.250 --> 1:15:34.625
You and your daughter.

1:15:35.375 --> 1:15:38.291
-They're not a part of this!
-Pendejo, you made them a part of it!

1:15:42.083 --> 1:15:43.750
-Don't touch me!
-Don't touch her!

1:15:43.833 --> 1:15:44.958
I'm not afraid of you.

1:15:45.041 --> 1:15:47.375
Such a brave muñeca.

1:15:47.458 --> 1:15:48.291
Take them.

1:15:48.375 --> 1:15:50.333
-No! No!
-No, don't touch her!

1:15:50.416 --> 1:15:52.708
-Leave her alone! Get your hands off her!
-Don't touch her!

1:15:52.791 --> 1:15:54.041
I'll come get you!

1:15:54.125 --> 1:15:55.458
-Daddy!

1:15:55.541 --> 1:15:58.458
-I'mma fix all of this. I love y'all!
-Cálmate, Bud.

1:15:58.541 --> 1:15:59.958
A new day is dawning,

1:16:00.041 --> 1:16:02.333
and your little girl's
gonna be a part of it.

1:16:02.416 --> 1:16:03.583
Get off of me.

1:16:06.708 --> 1:16:08.458
First, I'm gonna turn her,

1:16:08.541 --> 1:16:11.583
and then I'm gonna watch
as she drinks your wife.

1:16:12.333 --> 1:16:15.083
I wish
you could be there to see it,

1:16:15.166 --> 1:16:17.875
but I'm afraid
someone's having you for dinner.

1:16:38.125 --> 1:16:39.500
Daddy!

1:16:48.166 --> 1:16:49.041
Oh, I'm alive.

1:16:51.333 --> 1:16:52.666
Oh, Bud.

1:16:53.458 --> 1:16:54.416
Oh!

1:16:54.916 --> 1:16:56.375
Oh, I feel weird.

1:16:56.458 --> 1:16:58.208
Yeah, I bet… I bet you do.

1:16:58.291 --> 1:16:59.708
What happened to me?

1:16:59.791 --> 1:17:02.916
Just some bullshit. You know how shit go.

1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:04.125
But, uh…

1:17:04.625 --> 1:17:07.416
-You probably wanna… check your teeth.

1:17:07.500 --> 1:17:08.583
Check my teeth?

1:17:08.666 --> 1:17:11.041
Yeah, just check them.
There's a mirror over there.

1:17:11.125 --> 1:17:12.125
Oh…

1:17:13.250 --> 1:17:15.583
Oh! Oh no!

1:17:16.875 --> 1:17:18.750
Oh no. Oh, that's not good.

1:17:19.833 --> 1:17:23.208
-What! That was totally involuntary.
-It's like a hiccup, probably.

1:17:23.291 --> 1:17:26.458
-I'm sorry, man, it was all my fault.

1:17:26.541 --> 1:17:27.541
How you feel?

1:17:28.166 --> 1:17:30.791
Pretty horrified
about the fact that I'm a vampire.

1:17:30.875 --> 1:17:32.625
-Right. Right.
-But also like…

1:17:32.708 --> 1:17:34.708
-I don't know, kind of amazing.
-Yeah, like--

1:17:34.791 --> 1:17:37.541
Like my blood, it just…
it feels like it's on fire--

1:17:37.625 --> 1:17:39.916
Like you had, like,
a lot of energy drinks.

1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:42.083
Oh, I can smell everything!

1:17:43.166 --> 1:17:46.083
Oh God, did I shit myself this time?

1:17:46.166 --> 1:17:47.500
No, no, no, you look fine.

1:17:47.583 --> 1:17:49.541
-Is there like a mark?
-No, you look good.

1:17:49.625 --> 1:17:50.958
Everything looks great.

1:17:51.041 --> 1:17:52.791
Listen, let's just take it easy.

1:17:52.875 --> 1:17:54.875
-We're gonna work this out.

1:17:54.958 --> 1:17:56.041
Oh wow.

1:17:56.125 --> 1:17:57.250
Mainly I just…

1:17:57.958 --> 1:17:59.208
Whoa, I just feel

1:17:59.708 --> 1:18:00.583
hungry!

1:18:05.666 --> 1:18:07.416
Goddamn it, Seth.

1:18:10.625 --> 1:18:11.541
I'm sorry, kid.

1:18:11.625 --> 1:18:13.708
I'm actually gonna miss you, man,
you know?

1:18:13.791 --> 1:18:16.041
It's crazy how
you get attached to someone.

1:18:16.125 --> 1:18:17.208
Oh shit.

1:18:20.291 --> 1:18:21.166
Bud?

1:18:21.750 --> 1:18:22.708
Huh?

1:18:22.791 --> 1:18:25.750
You cut my head off.
I thought we were friends.

1:18:25.833 --> 1:18:27.958
I… You rushed me.

1:18:28.041 --> 1:18:30.541
It's just reaction. That's what I do.

1:18:31.208 --> 1:18:34.291
It's in my blood. It's like…
You ever see Tyson? He…

1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:36.833
You don't walk up on Tyson either.

1:18:37.375 --> 1:18:39.000
Friendship is complicated, huh?

1:18:40.416 --> 1:18:42.916
Yeah, friendships are complicated.

1:18:43.500 --> 1:18:46.208
All right, wait. Follow my voice.
Left, there. Yep, okay.

1:18:46.291 --> 1:18:48.458
Easy. No. Okay, easy, easy.

1:18:49.375 --> 1:18:51.083
Okay, here we go.

1:18:51.166 --> 1:18:52.166
The fuck?

1:18:52.750 --> 1:18:53.916
Okay, gentle.

1:18:54.916 --> 1:18:56.083
Gentle.

1:18:58.375 --> 1:18:59.708
Huh. Still fits.

1:19:01.083 --> 1:19:02.083
Wha…

1:19:05.875 --> 1:19:07.333
Oh, it's been quite the week.

1:19:07.416 --> 1:19:09.666
Yeah, it has. You good?

1:19:10.708 --> 1:19:12.375
-How do I look?
-You look all right.

1:19:12.458 --> 1:19:14.041
-You feel all right?
-You swear?

1:19:14.625 --> 1:19:16.083
-Yeah.

1:19:16.166 --> 1:19:17.416
-Hey!
-Sorry. Just kidding.

1:19:17.500 --> 1:19:19.458
-Okay. All right.
-Too soon. Too soon. All right.

1:19:22.041 --> 1:19:23.666
Hey, I'm sorry I tried to eat you.

1:19:23.750 --> 1:19:25.916
How 'bout we not report this
to Seeger until Monday?

1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:29.625
Seeger, shit. Oh, what?
You don't think he's gonna notice?

1:19:30.208 --> 1:19:33.083
What, am I just supposed to
wear turtlenecks from now on?

1:19:33.666 --> 1:19:37.000
I mean, I do look good in a T-neck,
but that's not sustainable.

1:19:38.416 --> 1:19:40.916
-Wait. Where are we going?
-Going to get my family back.

1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:43.333
I have to stop at my place
and get some information.

1:19:43.875 --> 1:19:46.583
What's going on with your neck?
Is it repairing itself?

1:19:47.375 --> 1:19:48.708
I actually think it is.

1:19:48.791 --> 1:19:50.916
Okay, just be careful.
Don't go over any speed bumps.

1:19:53.750 --> 1:19:55.000
Damn. Damn.

1:19:55.750 --> 1:19:56.750
My bad.

1:20:02.875 --> 1:20:05.375
You have a driving problem.
You know that, right?

1:20:05.458 --> 1:20:07.166
I gotta go to apartment 19.

1:20:07.958 --> 1:20:09.041
I'll be back in five.

1:20:16.333 --> 1:20:18.708
Heather, you just moved in.
Leaving so soon?

1:20:18.791 --> 1:20:20.875
Bud, just listen to me.

1:20:22.916 --> 1:20:24.458
Look, we need to talk.

1:20:24.541 --> 1:20:26.958
Talk? Vampires kidnapped my family.
You wanna talk?

1:20:27.041 --> 1:20:29.166
-I didn't have a choice.
-I don't give a rat's ass.

1:20:40.375 --> 1:20:42.708
This is stupid, Bud.
Let me at least explain.

1:20:48.750 --> 1:20:49.916
Okay, listen.

1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:53.541
Because of you, my family got kidnapped,
and my friend is dead.

1:20:54.125 --> 1:20:55.000
Or undead.

1:20:55.083 --> 1:20:56.833
So I don't want no problems, I just…

1:20:59.666 --> 1:21:01.000
That's what she does, Bud.

1:21:01.083 --> 1:21:03.708
-She turns people against their will.

1:21:03.791 --> 1:21:07.208
I wasn't even a familiar.
She just… just did this to me.

1:21:07.291 --> 1:21:09.166
You think I wanna
work for a monster like her?

1:21:09.250 --> 1:21:10.583
Then why do you?

1:21:15.125 --> 1:21:17.166
-She's my maker, okay?
-What?

1:21:17.250 --> 1:21:18.250
And an Uber Vamp.

1:21:18.333 --> 1:21:20.083
Look, she forced me to get close to you.

1:21:20.166 --> 1:21:22.250
She wanted to get back at you
for what you did to her.

1:21:22.333 --> 1:21:23.333
What you talking about?

1:21:24.208 --> 1:21:27.916
She just…
She just wanted to know how to hurt you.

1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:28.958
Why?

1:21:33.750 --> 1:21:35.833
So, you just gonna
light your finger on fire, huh?

1:21:44.416 --> 1:21:46.291
You killed a vampire Monday, didn't you?

1:21:46.375 --> 1:21:48.666
-Sweet old lady?
-Not so sweet, actually.

1:21:48.750 --> 1:21:50.416
That was Audrey's daughter.

1:21:52.208 --> 1:21:54.708
Daughter? How?

1:21:54.791 --> 1:21:57.750
When she came over, she had
a little girl she had to leave behind.

1:21:57.833 --> 1:22:01.458
So by the time they went back,
found her, and turned her, she was old.

1:22:01.958 --> 1:22:03.833
-And I killed her.
-And you killed her.

1:22:03.916 --> 1:22:05.791
And now they got Paige and Jocelyn.

1:22:05.875 --> 1:22:06.958
I'm sorry.

1:22:07.041 --> 1:22:10.500
-Hey, Bud. I don't feel so good.

1:22:11.041 --> 1:22:13.250
Could you hold my head for a little?

1:22:16.708 --> 1:22:17.791
Holy shit.

1:22:23.208 --> 1:22:26.666
You're walking on sacred ground.
You should be honored.

1:22:27.541 --> 1:22:28.791
Where are you taking us?

1:22:28.875 --> 1:22:31.375
-Why, are you frightened?
-No.

1:22:31.458 --> 1:22:32.291
You should be.

1:22:32.375 --> 1:22:34.625
Well, then you don't know me
that well, bitch. Ah!

1:22:36.625 --> 1:22:38.166
Why are you doing this?

1:22:38.250 --> 1:22:39.541
Paige, don't talk to her.

1:22:39.625 --> 1:22:40.916
She has a right to know.

1:22:41.875 --> 1:22:43.916
You don't get to decide--

1:22:46.916 --> 1:22:49.916
I had a daughter once, feisty like you.

1:22:50.583 --> 1:22:52.458
I wanted to make a better world for her.

1:22:52.541 --> 1:22:55.375
A world where
she could be free from hiding.

1:22:56.083 --> 1:22:58.375
But your father took that away from me.

1:22:58.958 --> 1:23:01.708
Now, you see,
it's only fair I take you away from him.

1:23:01.791 --> 1:23:04.541
-If you hurt her, I'll kill you.

1:23:04.625 --> 1:23:06.291
But I'm already dead.

1:23:08.416 --> 1:23:10.083
I'm not gonna hurt her, Ms. Jablonski.

1:23:10.166 --> 1:23:12.541
I'm gonna make sure
no one can ever hurt her again.

1:23:13.041 --> 1:23:14.875
-You should thank me.

1:23:14.958 --> 1:23:16.416
A war is coming,

1:23:16.500 --> 1:23:19.125
and your little girl's
gonna be on the winning side.

1:23:20.583 --> 1:23:21.625
-No!
-Paige!

1:23:23.500 --> 1:23:24.708
Let me go!

1:23:25.583 --> 1:23:26.541
No. No!

1:23:34.750 --> 1:23:36.166
-Come on.

1:23:39.083 --> 1:23:40.916
-Seth, hold your head still.

1:23:41.666 --> 1:23:43.583
Looks like they've turned him
with Uber blood,

1:23:43.666 --> 1:23:45.583
so he'll be unpredictable for a while.

1:23:45.666 --> 1:23:47.583
He'll get under control eventually.

1:23:50.166 --> 1:23:51.000
Here.

1:23:51.083 --> 1:23:53.208
No, I'm pescatarian.

1:23:53.291 --> 1:23:54.291
Come on.

1:23:55.541 --> 1:23:57.458
-Mm. Mmm!
-There we go.

1:23:58.000 --> 1:23:59.000
Mmm.

1:23:59.083 --> 1:24:01.916
You hunters are always
complaining about LA running dry.

1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:03.916
That's what Audrey's trying to change.

1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:05.750
It's, like, sweet but a little tangy.

1:24:05.833 --> 1:24:08.750
That's nice.
Oh yeah, get inside of me.

1:24:08.833 --> 1:24:11.666
She uses her cover as a realtor
to buy properties all over the Valley

1:24:11.750 --> 1:24:14.166
and move vamps
back in amongst the rest of us.

1:24:14.250 --> 1:24:16.125
Within a year, all vamp activity in LA

1:24:16.208 --> 1:24:18.625
will be traceable
to her sitting at the top.

1:24:18.708 --> 1:24:20.250
Not if I get to her first.

1:24:21.041 --> 1:24:21.958
I'll lead the way.

1:24:22.041 --> 1:24:24.958
-All right, I'm coming too.
-No, no, no. No. Hell no, Seth.

1:24:25.041 --> 1:24:27.375
You got too much energy now.
You fresh off some blood.

1:24:27.458 --> 1:24:30.000
I don't want you to switch up on me,
try to bite my kidneys out.

1:24:30.083 --> 1:24:31.541
No, Bud, listen. They tortured me.

1:24:31.625 --> 1:24:34.583
Okay, they drank my blood.
They cut my head off.

1:24:35.375 --> 1:24:39.041
I guess technically, you cut my head off,
but they turned me into this, okay?

1:24:39.125 --> 1:24:41.083
-I want to help take her down.
-Okay.

1:24:41.166 --> 1:24:44.083
We'll get you changed,
head back to my spot, and we'll gear up.

1:24:44.666 --> 1:24:46.333
-Oh, right now?
-Yeah, right now.

1:24:46.416 --> 1:24:48.833
What? It's dark out.
That's a suicide mission.

1:24:50.291 --> 1:24:52.333

We're surrounded.

1:27:12.791 --> 1:27:14.125
Black Cowboy.

1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:19.125
Get down.

1:27:42.791 --> 1:27:44.125
How the hell you get here?

1:27:44.625 --> 1:27:45.583
The snowflake.

1:27:46.333 --> 1:27:47.666
I might have texted him.

1:27:48.250 --> 1:27:50.500
-Welcome to the fucking Union, brother.
-Thank you.

1:27:50.583 --> 1:27:53.000
-Hey, hey, if you don't get your ass off--
-Oh. Sorry.

1:27:53.083 --> 1:27:54.041
-This way.
-Sorry.

1:27:54.125 --> 1:27:55.166
Come on, Big J.

1:27:55.250 --> 1:27:56.083
After you.

1:28:05.583 --> 1:28:09.333
Bud, in the back, look for the staircase.
That's the entrance to her tunnel.

1:28:09.416 --> 1:28:11.250
Keep going down, and you'll find her.

1:28:11.333 --> 1:28:13.791
There's a faster way down,
but you wouldn't survive it.

1:28:13.875 --> 1:28:15.125
We survive everything.

1:28:15.208 --> 1:28:16.958
See me fighting a bear,
you pour honey on me.

1:28:17.041 --> 1:28:18.583
You two go ahead. We'll catch up.

1:28:23.708 --> 1:28:25.583
Come on. Let's get cracking.

1:28:56.458 --> 1:28:58.000
Just like old times.

1:28:58.083 --> 1:28:59.125
I'm out.

1:29:01.666 --> 1:29:03.166
Look at this shit here. Jackpot.

1:29:03.250 --> 1:29:04.833
Man, look at all this gear.

1:29:06.833 --> 1:29:07.833
Okay.

1:29:09.458 --> 1:29:13.041
Ugh. Shit, look at this.
All this sunscreen.

1:29:13.125 --> 1:29:16.208
Vamps runnin' around in the day.
She could take over the Valley.

1:29:19.333 --> 1:29:20.791
Handle him, J!

1:29:21.375 --> 1:29:22.583
Okay.

1:29:22.666 --> 1:29:24.291
-Oh shit.

1:29:24.375 --> 1:29:27.041
I see you. He didn't know, did he?

1:29:27.125 --> 1:29:28.041
He didn't know.

1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:31.250
-Whoo! Get him, J.

1:29:34.208 --> 1:29:35.458
Stay down, fool.

1:29:35.541 --> 1:29:38.208
Yo. You did that
without even stretching, huh?

1:29:40.666 --> 1:29:41.875
That was my weak leg.

1:29:42.458 --> 1:29:44.625
See all this? Huh?

1:29:45.333 --> 1:29:46.333
All these guns?

1:29:47.625 --> 1:29:49.583
Check it out.
Silver-tipped wooden bullets.

1:29:49.666 --> 1:29:50.791
Vampire killers.

1:29:50.875 --> 1:29:52.041
What's that about?

1:29:53.208 --> 1:29:54.375
Is she El Jefe?

1:29:54.458 --> 1:29:56.458
Nah. El Jefe is bigger than this, brother.

1:29:56.541 --> 1:29:59.666
But, either way,
that bitch got an ass-whooping coming.

1:30:00.958 --> 1:30:01.791
Yeah.

1:30:14.500 --> 1:30:15.833
Yeah, they down here.

1:30:18.125 --> 1:30:19.291
Let's get cracking.

1:30:19.375 --> 1:30:20.791
Just like old times.

1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:27.208
He's coming.

1:30:27.833 --> 1:30:29.000
I can smell him.

1:30:30.375 --> 1:30:33.833
I don't know how all this works,
but I know my husband,

1:30:34.333 --> 1:30:36.000
and he's gonna murder you.

1:30:36.083 --> 1:30:38.666
-Ex-husband.
-See, now you're just being a bitch.

1:30:39.250 --> 1:30:41.666
Bring him to me.

1:30:42.875 --> 1:30:43.708
Paige.

1:30:52.541 --> 1:30:55.541
-This place ain't creepy at all.
-Tell me about it.

1:30:56.500 --> 1:30:57.333
Here we go.

1:31:29.208 --> 1:31:30.166
Bud!

1:31:38.416 --> 1:31:41.083
Jablonski…

1:31:54.500 --> 1:31:56.666
John!

1:32:13.458 --> 1:32:15.041
That's how we do, baby.

1:32:15.125 --> 1:32:18.083
You know how we do.
We bag 'em, and we tag 'em.

1:32:18.166 --> 1:32:19.500
That's how we get it done.

1:32:20.083 --> 1:32:21.666
-What's going on with you?

1:32:21.750 --> 1:32:24.291
Ain't nothing going on.
Ain't nothing wrong with me, man.

1:32:24.375 --> 1:32:27.208
-You all right?
-Shit. You know they can't fuck with me.

1:32:27.291 --> 1:32:28.750
Okay, but why you leaning like that?

1:32:28.833 --> 1:32:31.041
We been battle-tested.
This don't mean nothing.

1:32:31.125 --> 1:32:32.916
-All right.
-Nothing but a flesh wound, dog.

1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:36.583
Okay. Still, it don't look too good.
Come on, let's get up out of here.

1:32:37.958 --> 1:32:41.166
Come on. We ain't got much time.
Gotta get you out of here. Come on, man.

1:32:44.166 --> 1:32:45.291
Come on!

1:32:46.666 --> 1:32:49.333
-Big John, what the hell is you doing?
-I'm saving your Black ass.

1:32:49.416 --> 1:32:50.500
What are you talking about?

1:32:50.583 --> 1:32:52.500
Go get your family right now. I got this.

1:32:52.583 --> 1:32:55.000
-We can't do it like this.
-You know I work alone.

1:32:55.958 --> 1:32:57.666
-You crazy motherfucker.
-Go.

1:32:57.750 --> 1:32:59.416
-You better stay alive.
-Go!

1:33:00.583 --> 1:33:02.166
I'll be here waiting for you!

1:33:07.666 --> 1:33:09.375
All right, motherfuckers, come on!

1:33:51.750 --> 1:33:53.000
West side for life!

1:34:00.291 --> 1:34:01.333
John…

1:34:07.916 --> 1:34:11.916
I'm not supposed to kill you yet,
but you've been a real pain in the ass,

1:34:12.583 --> 1:34:13.875
so give me one good reason.

1:34:13.958 --> 1:34:14.916
Burn in hell.

1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:16.125
Good enough.

1:34:34.625 --> 1:34:37.375
-You're working on that landing, huh?
-No, I planned it like that.

1:34:37.458 --> 1:34:38.583
Go, we've got him.

1:35:01.875 --> 1:35:04.458
-No!

1:35:07.458 --> 1:35:08.500
Paige! Stay back.

1:35:09.958 --> 1:35:10.916
Daddy!

1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:13.250
-Joss, you okay?
-Yeah.

1:35:13.833 --> 1:35:16.083
All right. I'll let you go.

1:35:16.166 --> 1:35:18.750
A life for a life
or whatever the hell you have.

1:35:22.250 --> 1:35:24.708
You took my daughter, Jablonski.

1:35:25.375 --> 1:35:27.541
-I'm just returning the favor.
-No.

1:35:28.875 --> 1:35:30.875
-Mommy!
-Baby!

1:35:33.333 --> 1:35:34.625
What do you think, muñeca?

1:35:35.250 --> 1:35:36.833
I'm gonna kill your daddy,

1:35:36.916 --> 1:35:39.208
then I'm gonna make you
drink your mean old mommy,

1:35:39.291 --> 1:35:42.958
and then I'm gonna be
your new, improved mommy.

1:35:43.708 --> 1:35:45.041
-How does that sound?

1:35:45.125 --> 1:35:45.958
I hate you!

1:35:46.666 --> 1:35:48.291
That's not very nice.

1:35:48.875 --> 1:35:49.833
I hate you too.

1:36:01.333 --> 1:36:02.250
Daddy!

1:36:37.125 --> 1:36:38.041
Ah!

1:36:41.750 --> 1:36:43.416
I should've just got another job.

1:36:45.250 --> 1:36:46.750
Ah!

1:36:46.833 --> 1:36:49.166
-Baby, get up!
-Come on, Daddy, get up!

1:36:49.250 --> 1:36:50.500
Baby, I'm trying.

1:36:50.583 --> 1:36:52.291
-Try harder.
-Oh, okay.

1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:12.958
In the end,
the devil comes for everyone.

1:37:17.166 --> 1:37:18.750
That's what you get.

1:37:18.833 --> 1:37:20.291
Bitch.

1:37:21.291 --> 1:37:22.500
No!

1:37:23.875 --> 1:37:24.833
Mommy!

1:37:34.333 --> 1:37:35.583
Pull!

1:38:01.625 --> 1:38:04.708
Wood to the heart, silver to the neck.

1:38:20.416 --> 1:38:22.666
Your last bullet, cabrón?

1:38:33.750 --> 1:38:35.333
No!

1:38:49.083 --> 1:38:50.583
Fucking pool boy.

1:38:51.500 --> 1:38:52.583
The best.

1:38:57.500 --> 1:38:58.583
Y'all good?

1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:03.041
Works every time.

1:39:03.125 --> 1:39:04.125
Let's go.

1:39:09.375 --> 1:39:10.625
Come on, babe. Let's go.

1:39:12.875 --> 1:39:13.916
All right.

1:39:15.666 --> 1:39:17.375
-Hey. Where's Seth?
-Hey.

1:39:17.458 --> 1:39:20.041
-Whoa!
-No, no, no. Babe, babe, no.

1:39:20.125 --> 1:39:21.500
They're the good vampires.

1:39:21.583 --> 1:39:24.250
That's my girl Heather.
That's my guy Seth.

1:39:24.333 --> 1:39:25.583
-Hey.

1:39:25.666 --> 1:39:26.666
Whose arm is that?

1:39:27.375 --> 1:39:28.958
Oh. Sorry.

1:39:29.458 --> 1:39:32.333
But, Bud… got my first pair of fangs.

1:39:32.416 --> 1:39:33.416
Whoa.

1:39:34.291 --> 1:39:35.583
That's big money right there.

1:39:35.666 --> 1:39:36.791
-Guess what?
-What's that?

1:39:36.875 --> 1:39:38.333
I didn't pee myself this time.

1:39:38.916 --> 1:39:41.208
-Get out.
-Vampires don't pee or poop.

1:39:41.291 --> 1:39:42.666
Nah, they don't.

1:39:43.250 --> 1:39:47.083
-Please let me have this little victory.
-Of course you can. C'mon. Let's go.

1:39:49.791 --> 1:39:51.500
Do they really not pee or poop?

1:39:51.583 --> 1:39:54.708
-Does that mean they're full of shit?
-Language!

1:40:02.625 --> 1:40:03.791
Big John.

1:40:03.875 --> 1:40:05.250
I'll miss you, baby.

1:40:13.333 --> 1:40:14.166
Oh, no.

1:40:14.250 --> 1:40:15.375
Go ahead. Come on.

1:40:16.083 --> 1:40:17.708
It's got good energy in that.

1:40:21.166 --> 1:40:22.000
All right.

1:40:22.916 --> 1:40:25.458
We were hiding right over there.
Right over there.

1:40:25.541 --> 1:40:26.875
Jablonski!

1:40:27.833 --> 1:40:30.791
Seeger? What the hell you doing,
walking all fast like that?

1:40:31.750 --> 1:40:32.916
New shoe boots on.

1:40:33.708 --> 1:40:36.791
And you. What are you, sick?

1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:39.416
-Uh, pink eye.
-What?

1:40:39.500 --> 1:40:41.416
It's when poo particles get in your eye.

1:40:42.500 --> 1:40:43.583
Where's Big John?

1:40:47.125 --> 1:40:49.500
Oh goddamn it!

1:40:50.916 --> 1:40:51.958
I did you a solid.

1:40:52.041 --> 1:40:55.916
But now you have
graciously returned the favor

1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:58.416
because after the shit
you pulled here tonight,

1:40:58.500 --> 1:41:00.625
I'll never have to deal with you again.

1:41:01.416 --> 1:41:02.958
For starters,

1:41:03.041 --> 1:41:07.583
flagrantly violating code 682,
operating outside of your shift.

1:41:07.666 --> 1:41:09.041
Actually, sir, if I may.

1:41:09.791 --> 1:41:12.916
Code 741 states that,
"If a hunter is in a 911 situation,

1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:14.875
he may circumvent normal operating hours

1:41:14.958 --> 1:41:17.833
so long as he notifies the Union
before entering," which he did.

1:41:17.916 --> 1:41:19.875
Thank you. Thank you for that.

1:41:19.958 --> 1:41:23.625
There's also code 584,
unlawful termination of familiars

1:41:23.708 --> 1:41:25.583
without prior authorization.

1:41:25.666 --> 1:41:28.375
Yes, sir, that is correct,
but Section 4 states,

1:41:28.458 --> 1:41:31.208
"When fired on, a hunter is
lawfully allowed to return fire,"

1:41:31.291 --> 1:41:32.625
which is what happened here.

1:41:33.375 --> 1:41:37.333
Code 424, "A Union hunter
must make all reasonable efforts

1:41:37.416 --> 1:41:41.375
to limit collateral damage to property
while engaging in a hunt."

1:41:41.458 --> 1:41:42.333
Boom!

1:41:42.416 --> 1:41:44.416
-Sir, code 42--
-I got this.

1:41:44.500 --> 1:41:49.166
Code 424 was rescinded by
the national office in January.

1:41:49.250 --> 1:41:51.208
Boom. Boom.

1:41:51.291 --> 1:41:53.708
-Someone's been reading.
-Saw it in the newsletter.

1:41:53.791 --> 1:41:55.916
Yeah. I see what's going on here.

1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:56.833
Uh-huh.

1:41:57.375 --> 1:41:58.333
Loopholes.

1:41:59.750 --> 1:42:01.458
Think you're smarter than me?

1:42:01.958 --> 1:42:04.875
Then you can probably spell "traitor."

1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:06.833
Sure.

1:42:06.916 --> 1:42:09.666
T-R-A-I-T-O-R. What was the point of that?

1:42:13.708 --> 1:42:15.916
Carol's keeping her fucking desk.

1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:17.916
Good! She can have it.

1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:22.125
I'm a field man now!
Mowing down vamps with my best friend Bud.

1:42:25.125 --> 1:42:27.833
-That felt good.
-You did that.

1:42:27.916 --> 1:42:30.125
Wait. Shit. What are you
gonna do about the money?

1:42:30.208 --> 1:42:32.000
-Oh, I'm good.

1:42:32.083 --> 1:42:33.750
Think I'm gonna be all right.

1:42:33.833 --> 1:42:34.666
And, uh…

1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:37.083
fuck Carol.

1:42:38.500 --> 1:42:39.708
Hey, should I drink Carol?

1:42:39.791 --> 1:42:41.291
No, no, that's a lot of cholesterol.

1:42:41.375 --> 1:42:42.333
Right, okay.

1:42:42.416 --> 1:42:45.041
I won't go out of my way,
but if, like, there's a chance encounter

1:42:45.125 --> 1:42:46.500
outside her house at night or…

1:42:46.583 --> 1:42:48.000
-Yeah. Later.
-See you, guys!

1:42:48.083 --> 1:42:49.416
-Bye.
-See you, guys.

1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:51.916
What about us?

1:42:53.583 --> 1:42:54.666
What about us?

1:42:55.166 --> 1:42:57.666
I was thinking,
what if we tried this whole, you know,

1:42:57.750 --> 1:42:59.500
stay on the same groove type thing.

1:42:59.583 --> 1:43:01.708
You know, me cooking breakfast. You know?

1:43:01.791 --> 1:43:05.458
How about we take it
one day at a time, but no more lies.

1:43:05.541 --> 1:43:08.666
After what we've seen tonight,
there is no reason to lie.

1:43:08.750 --> 1:43:12.541
So I ask you a question,
and you give me a straight answer.

1:43:12.625 --> 1:43:15.208
I can live under those terms, you know.

1:43:15.291 --> 1:43:16.125
Okay.

1:43:16.750 --> 1:43:18.625
Yeah, I don't think we're there yet.

1:43:18.708 --> 1:43:21.000
Mm-hmm. You just gonna leave me like this?

1:43:25.791 --> 1:43:28.333
Mmm. Jump back, want to kiss myself.

1:43:29.125 --> 1:43:31.166
I'm gonna be a vampire hunter too.

1:43:31.666 --> 1:43:32.541
Uh…

1:43:32.625 --> 1:43:33.916
-No.
-No.

1:43:34.958 --> 1:43:38.375
-Daddy, why do you call me Pickle?
-Because that's what you are, baby.

1:43:38.458 --> 1:43:41.333
Sometimes you're a sweet pickle,
sometimes you're a sour pickle,

1:43:41.416 --> 1:43:43.375
and sometimes you're a salty pickle.

1:43:43.458 --> 1:43:44.791
I love you, Daddy.
