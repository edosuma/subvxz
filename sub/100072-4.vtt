Welcome, everyone.

My name is Von Jiener,

00:39.505 --> 00:41.757
and I'm Vice President
of Creative Bankruptcy

00:41.758 --> 00:43.300
for the Fox TV network,

00:43.301 --> 00:44.760
which, at the time
of this writing,

00:44.761 --> 00:46.386
is still a thing that exists.

00:46.387 --> 00:48.388
Just from looking at
your clothes and weight,

00:48.389 --> 00:51.516
I can tell you all watch a lot
of free network television.

00:51.517 --> 00:53.226
Am I right?

00:53.227 --> 00:55.437
Excellent.

00:55.438 --> 00:57.731
You have been selected
to be part of a focus group

00:57.732 --> 00:59.274
that could affect
one of America's

00:59.275 --> 01:02.486
<i>most beloved television shows:
Family Guy.</i>

01:02.487 --> 01:05.280
That woman looks
exactly like me.

01:05.281 --> 01:06.907
That's your reflection, Peter.

01:06.908 --> 01:08.325
Oh.

01:08.326 --> 01:10.160
I'm beautiful.

01:10.161 --> 01:11.620
As you may or may not care,

01:11.621 --> 01:14.081
<i>Family Guy is in
its 17th season.</i>

01:14.082 --> 01:16.124
And since Fox is now owned
by Disney,

01:16.125 --> 01:18.210
which will someday be owned
by Netflix,

01:18.211 --> 01:19.628
which will someday be
owned by Pornhub,

01:19.629 --> 01:23.090
<i>we have decided that Family Guy
is ready for a reboot.</i>

01:23.091 --> 01:25.759
Reboot? I thought they said
it was a couple of tweaks.

01:25.760 --> 01:27.469
Yeah, we're supposed to
trust these idiots?

01:27.470 --> 01:29.846
That woman has her finger
up her nose.

01:29.847 --> 01:32.057
That's still
your reflection, Peter.

01:32.058 --> 01:35.185
Oh. She's beautiful.

01:35.186 --> 01:37.145
Now, as most unfunny women
will tell you,

01:37.146 --> 01:39.231
women are very funny.

01:39.232 --> 01:41.149
That's why our first reboot
is built around

01:41.150 --> 01:42.943
the very popular Louise.

01:42.944 --> 01:46.029
- It's Lois.
- Whatever. The mom.

Yes, Joe, I'm going to work.

02:02.505 --> 02:06.341
Great! More and more women
are doing that.

02:11.431 --> 02:13.181
Good morning, goddess.

02:13.182 --> 02:15.308
You know, I just want
to say again that you were

02:15.309 --> 02:16.560
totally right last night
to bring up

02:16.561 --> 02:18.687

11 years ago.

02:18.688 --> 02:21.398
And please feel free
to bring it up again anytime,

02:21.399 --> 02:23.692

something completely unrelated.

02:23.693 --> 02:25.319
Thank you, Peter, I will.

02:25.320 --> 02:27.821
Oh, I-I know you will.

02:27.822 --> 02:29.489
- Morning, Lois.
- Hey, girl.

02:29.490 --> 02:32.242
Oh, hello, gay couple
who's constantly jogging.

02:32.243 --> 02:33.910
What are you up to this morning?

02:33.911 --> 02:35.787
Just adopting
and pucker-kissing.

02:35.788 --> 02:38.206
Yeah, we're network TV gay,

02:38.207 --> 02:40.292
so all we can do is
adopt children

02:40.293 --> 02:42.335
and pucker-kiss,
no tongue stuff.

02:42.336 --> 02:44.337
- Isn't that right, sweetie?
- Mwah!

02:44.338 --> 02:46.631
Well, I'm off to
my high-powered job

02:46.632 --> 02:50.177
at a fashion magazine,
greeting card company or winery.

02:50.178 --> 02:51.970
I can't wait to see which.

02:51.971 --> 02:55.348
<i>Oh, yay! It's a winery!</i>

02:55.349 --> 02:57.225
Good morning, Judy Greer.

02:57.226 --> 02:59.644
Morning, Lois.
How was your night last night?

02:59.645 --> 03:01.188
Great. I worked out,
made dinner,

03:01.189 --> 03:02.564
a little family time,

03:02.565 --> 03:04.775
and had Peter's ankles
up in the air by 11:00.

03:04.776 --> 03:06.485
God, I admire you.

03:06.486 --> 03:08.695
That's what you're here for,
Judy Greer.

03:08.696 --> 03:10.322
Oh, I almost forgot.

03:10.323 --> 03:11.865
Bert wants to see you
in his office.

03:11.866 --> 03:13.825
- Oh? What about?
- He didn't say.

03:13.826 --> 03:15.702
But it sounded hashtag serious.

03:15.703 --> 03:17.621
Aw, meeting with the boss.

03:17.622 --> 03:21.041
This is gonna be worse than
finding a spider in the kitchen.

03:21.042 --> 03:22.417
Oh, my God.

03:22.418 --> 03:24.669
Peter, there's a spider in here!

03:24.670 --> 03:27.215
Yeah, I know, genius.

03:28.841 --> 03:29.925
Hi, Lois.

03:29.926 --> 03:31.343
I wanted to let you know

03:31.344 --> 03:33.512
I'm considering you
for a big promotion.

03:33.513 --> 03:35.347
Really? That's amazing.

03:35.348 --> 03:37.933
Well, the job's not yours yet.

03:37.934 --> 03:39.559
It's between you
and one other person,

03:39.560 --> 03:42.020
Smarmy J. Tie-Straightener
the Third.

03:42.021 --> 03:45.482
I hit a gay jogger
on my way to work today.

03:50.446 --> 03:52.697
Sorry I only satisfied you
twice tonight.

03:52.698 --> 03:54.866
I found a pouch of
Big League Chew earlier,

03:54.867 --> 03:56.368
and my jaw is worn out.

03:56.369 --> 03:58.495
You did great, Peter.

03:58.496 --> 03:59.956
Good night, perfect.

04:01.666 --> 04:06.253
Aw, I just don't know what to do
about this thing at work.

04:06.254 --> 04:08.588
I... Are we still
talking about that?

04:08.589 --> 04:10.590
I mean, it's fine
if we are, w-we just...

04:10.591 --> 04:12.300
We talked about it before dinner

04:12.301 --> 04:14.344
and-and during dinner
and after dinner.

04:14.345 --> 04:16.471
No, you're right.
I'll be fine.

04:16.471 --> 04:18.349
Good night, Peter.

04:19.475 --> 04:20.976
Oh.

04:20.976 --> 04:23.353
I just want
this promotion so bad.

04:23.354 --> 04:25.355
Okay, so we are
talking about it.

04:25.356 --> 04:27.524
You know what?
I'll make a vision board.

04:27.525 --> 04:30.694
See my success
and be my success.

04:30.695 --> 04:34.447
My testosterone is so low I
could not have thought of that.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.616
Would you like me to put on
our sleep ocean noises

04:36.617 --> 04:39.161
with an occasional
shocking seagull screech?

04:39.162 --> 04:41.789
Yes, thanks.
I have a big day tomorrow.

04:43.374 --> 04:44.416
Good night.

04:51.924 --> 04:53.341
Excuse me.

04:53.342 --> 04:54.926
May I have your attention,
please?

04:54.927 --> 04:56.386
Now, I know you're all wondering

04:56.387 --> 04:59.139
who is going to get
the big promotion,

04:59.140 --> 05:03.518
and I'm proud to announce
that person is Smarmy...

05:03.519 --> 05:06.480
Excuse me, where do I put
this briefcase full of money?

05:06.481 --> 05:07.898
Uh, who are you?

05:07.899 --> 05:10.400
I'm president of Wine and
Paint Night Incorporated.

05:10.401 --> 05:12.736
Lois Griffin
just landed my account

05:12.737 --> 05:15.155
through her wit,
charm and professionalism.

05:15.156 --> 05:17.490
Is that so?
Well, in that case,

05:17.491 --> 05:19.910
the big promotion
goes to Lois Griffin!

05:30.421 --> 05:33.423
What can I say?
I love my wife.

05:33.424 --> 05:35.967
Eh, it's my show.
Why shouldn't this be me?

05:35.968 --> 05:37.552
'Cause I'm the funny one.

05:37.553 --> 05:38.845
Not on this show you're not.

05:38.846 --> 05:40.764
Or am I?

05:40.765 --> 05:43.308
Ah, I thought we had
one more face.

05:43.309 --> 05:44.726
So, what did you think?

05:44.727 --> 05:47.312
And please keep in mind
that your spontaneous comments

05:47.313 --> 05:49.439
will affect the jobs
of hundreds of people.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.192
Come on, you idiots,
don't screw me.

05:52.193 --> 05:53.985
The show is from
a woman's perspective,

05:53.986 --> 05:56.696
but it still felt like
it was written by a man.

05:56.697 --> 05:59.532
Okay, well,
what if I told you shut up?

05:59.533 --> 06:01.409
Yeah, kind of changes things,
doesn't it?

06:01.410 --> 06:02.744
Anyone else?

06:02.745 --> 06:04.746
I'm sorry, I was scrolling
through the weather

06:04.747 --> 06:05.914
in random cities.

06:05.915 --> 06:08.166
Great! You're taking this
very seriously.

06:08.167 --> 06:10.585
<i>You know what, I don't
really get Family Guy.</i>

06:10.586 --> 06:12.003
What's so hard to get?

06:12.004 --> 06:13.672
You just need to have
grown up in the '80s

06:13.673 --> 06:15.048
but still be a teenager.

06:15.049 --> 06:17.842
So, based on that one episode
featuring Lois,

06:17.843 --> 06:21.054
how many of you would
likely watch a second?

06:21.055 --> 06:22.597
Son of a bitch!

06:22.598 --> 06:24.057
Anything else?

06:36.153 --> 06:37.988
It's a focus group

06:37.989 --> 06:39.323

06:41.534 --> 06:42.659

10:47.530 --> 10:49.406
Guys, look!

10:51.825 --> 10:53.243
She's dead.

10:53.244 --> 10:56.204
Boy, she... she did stiffen up
those nips, didn't she?

10:56.205 --> 10:58.373
Y'all ready for your lasagnas?

10:58.374 --> 11:00.543
We're in the woods.

11:02.753 --> 11:05.755
Guys, it's time to fire up
our superpowers,

11:05.756 --> 11:08.925
because we're also
lesser-known Marvel characters.

11:12.096 --> 11:13.846
And I'm your neighbor,
who you didn't know

11:13.847 --> 11:16.849
was also a superhero,
Captain Pedantic.

11:16.850 --> 11:19.102
Are you here to protect
Zac and I?

11:19.103 --> 11:21.062
<i>Zac and me, but yeah.</i>

11:29.071 --> 11:31.949
Now is when you find out
I'm the sheriff.

11:38.038 --> 11:39.872
I'm laying...

11:39.873 --> 11:41.791
on a pinecone.

11:43.002 --> 11:44.711
<i>He means lying on a pinecone.</i>

11:44.712 --> 11:46.004
Now what happens?

11:46.005 --> 11:48.590
Now one of us will become
a breakout movie star

11:48.591 --> 11:51.051
and leave the series,
wrecking it for the rest of us.

11:52.761 --> 11:55.013
Yay, it's me!

11:55.014 --> 11:57.098
- Sir, what did you think?
- Pass.

11:57.099 --> 11:59.517
Okay. And how many of you
would watch it

11:59.518 --> 12:03.062
if the girls were wearing
white shirts and black bras?

12:03.063 --> 12:05.773
Peter, did you write
the focus group questions?

12:05.774 --> 12:07.442
What? Course not.

12:07.443 --> 12:09.110
"And if you're impressed
by the size of

12:09.111 --> 12:10.820
"Alexander Skarsgard's penis,

12:10.821 --> 12:13.156
that doesn't
make you gay, right?"

12:13.157 --> 12:14.658
Answer him!

12:20.789 --> 12:22.415
I know you've been here all day,

12:22.416 --> 12:24.834
but it's not like
you have jobs to go to,

12:24.835 --> 12:27.170
so I'm going to show you
one more reboot idea.

12:27.171 --> 12:29.339
Which Wi-Fi should
we be logging onto?

12:29.340 --> 12:31.299
Glendale Galleria Public.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.842
Yeah, that's what
I've been trying.

12:32.843 --> 12:34.886
Sometimes networks will
cancel a show

12:34.887 --> 12:37.221
only to reboot it
with less-popular characters

12:37.222 --> 12:40.141
from the original, while
the more-popular actors go on

12:40.142 --> 12:44.604
to find greater success in
movies or ugly public divorces.

12:55.324 --> 12:58.409
<i>♪ On which we used to rely ♪</i>

12:58.410 --> 13:01.788

13:17.388 --> 13:19.847

13:20.891 --> 13:22.350
I'll get it.

13:24.019 --> 13:27.146
Hello?
Oh, hey there, Stewie.

13:27.147 --> 13:29.357
Or should I say, "G'day, mate,"

13:29.358 --> 13:31.567
since you're in Queensland,
Australia, where you moved

13:31.568 --> 13:34.112
with Brian and Meg
after Mom and Dad died?

13:35.364 --> 13:37.365
Oh, married life is pretty good.

13:37.366 --> 13:40.326
No, still no kids,
but I've been practicing

13:40.327 --> 13:42.745
a lot by myself.

13:42.746 --> 13:44.497
Masturbating, yes.

13:44.498 --> 13:47.917
Between you and me, I think
Tricia might be barren.

13:52.131 --> 13:55.466
Uh, Stewie, I better go.
Tricia's giving me that look.

13:57.886 --> 13:59.429
Okay, give my love
to Brian and Meg,

13:59.430 --> 14:02.223
and hopefully we can come down
there for the season finale.

14:02.224 --> 14:04.976
No? You're just not gonna be
a part of this at all?

14:04.977 --> 14:06.853
Okay, then. Bye, Stewie.

14:06.854 --> 14:09.480
Chris, I'm standing here
in the living room

14:09.481 --> 14:12.900
because I need to talk to you
about something very important.

14:12.901 --> 14:14.360
Look, we've been through this.

14:14.361 --> 14:16.904
It's my house,
and I want to wear shoes in it.

14:16.905 --> 14:18.698
Chris, I offer you a choice.

14:18.699 --> 14:21.451
You can either continue
wearing shoes in the house

14:21.452 --> 14:26.331
or continue having sex with this
age-defying Eastern physique.

14:35.215 --> 14:39.135
Chris, I'm lying here
listening to you toss and turn,

14:39.136 --> 14:42.346
and wondering if there's
something you'd like to discuss.

14:42.347 --> 14:45.308
I don't know.
It's just, it's been so hard

14:45.309 --> 14:47.143
since Mom and Dad died

14:47.144 --> 14:49.687
and Joe moved in
with all his big band records.

14:51.774 --> 14:52.607
Joe!

14:52.608 --> 14:54.233
Chris, I'm lying here

14:54.234 --> 14:57.570
asking you to kick Joe
out of the house.

14:57.571 --> 15:00.072
What? He was my dad's
best friend for 20 years.

15:00.073 --> 15:01.491
I can't do that.

15:01.492 --> 15:04.994
Chris, I offer you a choice.

15:07.331 --> 15:09.540
Luckily, I'm the town windower.

15:09.541 --> 15:12.335
For me, every day is a pane.

15:13.587 --> 15:15.463
<i>Can we please stop this?</i>

15:15.464 --> 15:18.883
- Yes?
- If I give you back my Diet Sprite, can I leave?

15:18.884 --> 15:20.551
How did you feel about the show?

15:20.552 --> 15:22.929
- I didn't like it.
- Could you be more specific?

15:22.930 --> 15:25.556
I just don't like the people
or what they're saying or doing.

15:25.557 --> 15:27.308
If you could sum up the show
with one sound,

15:27.309 --> 15:28.643
what would it be?

15:28.644 --> 15:30.686
- "Blech."
- For me, it was more like

15:30.687 --> 15:33.022
the last squirt of
a plastic mustard bottle.

15:34.149 --> 15:35.775
<i>Is that our mustard?</i>

15:35.776 --> 15:39.028
No. I always bring one with me
in case the show is kind of...

15:39.988 --> 15:41.113
Everybody, shut up!

15:41.114 --> 15:43.199
<i>Hey, it's that sheriff
from The Q.</i>

15:43.200 --> 15:44.575
You people don't like anything.

15:44.576 --> 15:45.993
Well, if you're all so smart,

15:45.994 --> 15:48.371
<i>what do you want to see
in a Family Guy reboot?</i>

15:48.372 --> 15:50.873
Yes, unemployable
neck tattoo guy.

15:50.874 --> 15:52.124
It's a Bible verse.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.668
Doesn't matter.
Anything above the Adam's apple

15:53.669 --> 15:55.044
means drugs.

15:55.045 --> 15:57.129
I like Netflix.
Could you be Netflix?

15:57.130 --> 15:58.506
Yeah, Netflix is awesome.

15:58.507 --> 16:00.091
Of course it's awesome;
it's Netflix.

16:00.092 --> 16:02.635
Look, we're stuck being Fox.
We have to deal with it, okay?

16:02.636 --> 16:05.263
- I watch Fox.
- No, you don't. Nobody does.

16:05.264 --> 16:07.348
Yeah, I like shows
that are binge-worthy.

16:07.349 --> 16:09.225
First of all,
"binge-worthy" is not a word,

16:09.226 --> 16:10.476
it's a marketing tool.

16:10.477 --> 16:12.353
You've been brainwashed, sir.
But fine.

16:12.354 --> 16:15.356
<i>We'll make Family Guy
binge-worthy.</i>

17:06.241 --> 17:07.700
See? Wasn't that terrible?

17:07.701 --> 17:10.286
All right, we only have the room
till 6:00, so what else?

17:10.287 --> 17:13.247
It's not 6:00 yet! What else?!

17:13.248 --> 17:16.166
<i>Young Sheldon is good.
How about Young Family Guy?</i>

17:16.167 --> 17:17.667
How about I murder
your whole family?

17:17.669 --> 17:20.128
<i>- What about BoJack Horseman?
- Hard no.</i>

17:20.130 --> 17:22.339
- You'd get to be a horse.
- Hard yes.

17:22.340 --> 17:26.093
- Normal words, but a horse guy.
- Can we please stop this?

17:26.094 --> 17:27.720
You just asked
for specifically that.

17:27.721 --> 17:30.473
It's not 6:00! What else?

17:30.474 --> 17:33.142
<i>- I like that Antiques Roadshow.
- Fine.</i>

17:33.143 --> 17:34.435
And you're saying this is...?

17:34.436 --> 17:36.145
George Washington's poop.
That's correct.

17:36.146 --> 17:37.813
I have some news
you might not like.

17:37.814 --> 17:39.357
The poop is only two weeks old.

17:39.358 --> 17:41.108
What? How can you be sure?

17:41.109 --> 17:43.194
Well, for starters,
there's a Skittle in it.

17:43.195 --> 17:46.197
Ah, the general had
a sweet tooth, huh?

17:46.198 --> 17:48.199
Um, that was horrible.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.283
Eh, I'm gonna tweeze
the Skittle out

17:49.284 --> 17:50.409
and go back in a week.

17:50.410 --> 17:52.620
I like those Netflix
stand-up specials.

17:52.621 --> 17:54.288
Great. Matter of fact,
we filmed one

17:54.289 --> 17:57.458
back when I was an all-setup-
no-punch-line comedian.

17:57.459 --> 17:59.543
So, any of you out there
have a futon?

17:59.544 --> 18:02.213
Yeah, yeah, right?

18:02.214 --> 18:04.298
I Ubered here tonight.

18:05.509 --> 18:08.260
Man, Starbucks.

18:08.261 --> 18:10.179
Facebook, huh?

18:10.180 --> 18:13.307
And how about that new chip
in credit cards?

18:13.308 --> 18:15.851
Anybody ever been to Georgia?

18:15.852 --> 18:18.270
The new iPhone is large.

18:19.564 --> 18:21.357
EDM music.

18:21.358 --> 18:23.234
Boo! You stink!

18:23.235 --> 18:26.696
Yeah! Dane Cook already did
all these halves of jokes.

18:26.697 --> 18:28.406
Hey, hey, this is my job.

18:28.407 --> 18:31.325
I don't go down to Burger King.

18:31.326 --> 18:32.535
That was terrible.

18:32.536 --> 18:34.787
Netflix should make
800 more of those.

18:34.788 --> 18:36.288
All right, what else?
What else you guys want?

18:36.289 --> 18:38.499
I like that thing
James Corden does:

18:38.500 --> 18:40.335
<i>- Carpool Karaoke.
- I can do that.</i>

18:41.461 --> 18:43.546
Hi. You having a good night?
I did.

18:43.547 --> 18:45.423
Just had a devil's three-way.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.174
You know, me and two guys.

18:47.175 --> 18:50.177
I think that's just gay sex.
Why are you telling me all this?

18:50.178 --> 18:51.679
<i>Isn't this Taxicab Confessions?</i>

18:51.680 --> 18:54.306
<i>No, this is Carpool Karaoke.</i>

18:54.307 --> 18:55.683
We're about to sing
an Adele song.

18:55.684 --> 18:56.851
Oh, that's gay.

18:56.852 --> 18:59.228
Pull over by this hot guy
and let me out.

18:59.229 --> 19:02.273
I thought I read you guys
were phasing out gay jokes.

19:02.274 --> 19:03.858
That quote was taken
out of context

19:03.859 --> 19:05.276
and widely misunderstood.

19:05.277 --> 19:06.819
All right, what's next,
you sheep?

19:06.820 --> 19:09.572
I like the Olympics.
Can you guys be the Olympics?

19:09.573 --> 19:11.323
Well, NBC hogs
all the good sports,

19:11.324 --> 19:13.367
so we'll get stuck
with the boring ones

19:13.368 --> 19:16.120
that the announcers always
have to keep apologizing for.

19:16.121 --> 19:17.413
Welcome back to pairs diving.

19:17.414 --> 19:19.540
And once again,
we are so sorry for this.

19:19.541 --> 19:21.333
Brian, anything to add?

19:21.334 --> 19:23.794
No, just our deepest condolences
to a bored nation.

19:23.795 --> 19:25.379
And we've got Lois
down at the pool.

19:25.380 --> 19:27.840
- Lois, anything?
- No. Guys, just so sorry

19:27.841 --> 19:29.342
that any of this is happening.

19:29.343 --> 19:31.260
I-I mean, even once
every four years

19:31.261 --> 19:33.179
seems like just way too much.

19:33.180 --> 19:36.640
And they're up in the air,
and now they're in the water.

19:36.641 --> 19:38.934
- What is it again?
- A splash is bad?

19:38.935 --> 19:40.519
Uh, yeah, I think so.

19:40.520 --> 19:42.605
That's so stupid.

19:42.606 --> 19:44.356
I'm sick of all the voices
on your show.

19:44.357 --> 19:45.941
- Can you change them up?
- To who?

19:45.942 --> 19:47.359
I like Jon Benjamin voices.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.737
Can you all be
Jon Benjamin voices?

19:49.738 --> 19:50.905
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, Peter.

19:50.906 --> 19:53.741
- Hey, Quagmire.
- Hey, Cleveland. Giggity.

19:53.742 --> 19:55.910
What can I get for you fellas?

19:55.911 --> 19:59.080
<i>Nobody touches my voice.</i>

19:59.081 --> 20:00.247
I liked all of that.

20:00.248 --> 20:02.291
Um, except for the bartender.

20:02.292 --> 20:05.586
Hey, guys, The Coffee Bean's
Wi-Fi doesn't need a password.

20:05.587 --> 20:07.338
Everyone, the reboot is off.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.298
It turns out
the executive who ordered it

20:09.299 --> 20:11.467
was just a squirrel
who snuck into the office.

20:11.468 --> 20:13.427
- What?
- Yes. But in fairness,

20:13.428 --> 20:16.514
<i>it was the same squirrel who
green-lit Brooklyn Nine-Nine,</i>

20:16.515 --> 20:18.516
the show that challenged
the notion

20:18.517 --> 20:20.893
that only attractive people
can be on television.

20:20.894 --> 20:22.978
So, what does that mean?

20:22.979 --> 20:26.232
<i>It means Family Guy
is just fine as it is.</i>

20:30.320 --> 20:32.404
<i>Well, the Family Guy
reboot is off.</i>

20:32.405 --> 20:33.864
What other ideas do we have?

20:35.992 --> 20:37.868
<i>Brooklyn Nine-Ten?</i>

20:37.869 --> 20:40.663
It's possible
this guy only has one idea.

20:47.421 --> 20:49.296
You know what,
I'm glad, after all that,

20:49.297 --> 20:51.423
they let us keep the show
the way it was.

20:51.424 --> 20:53.259
Well, not exactly
the way it was.

20:53.260 --> 20:57.221
Hey, buddy, I brought over
my big band records.

20:57.222 --> 21:00.057
- They wanted more Joe.
- They wanted more Joe.

21:06.815 --> 21:09.692
<i>Your show should have
more Joe Swanson.</i>

21:19.953 --> 21:22.496
<i>Your show should have
more Joe Swanson.</i>
