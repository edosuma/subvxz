WEBVTT

00:16.433 --> 00:18.393
And...

00:18.476 --> 00:20.270
c'est fini!

00:26.401 --> 00:29.154
There.

00:30.363 --> 00:33.324
This is a fairly rich dessert.

00:33.408 --> 00:36.035
A light supper,
perhaps a roast chicken,

00:36.119 --> 00:38.371
would make a perfect
accompaniment.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.457
And here I have
a chilled Sauternes,

00:40.540 --> 00:42.542
one of the noble
wines of France,

00:42.625 --> 00:47.547
to drink with our glamorous
mousse à la framboise.

00:47.630 --> 00:50.633
And that's all for today
on "The French Chef."

00:50.717 --> 00:52.302
I'm Julia Child.

00:52.385 --> 00:53.970
Bon appétit!

00:54.053 --> 00:55.680
And cut!

00:55.764 --> 00:58.141
Yes, she's all yours.
Yes, she's all yours.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.517
Yes.

00:59.601 --> 01:02.145
Oh, you've got the spoons
out already.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.067
Mmm.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.527
God almighty.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.904
It's like --

01:10.987 --> 01:13.990
It's like biting into
a raspberry chocolate cloud.

01:14.073 --> 01:15.450
Julia!

01:15.533 --> 01:16.826
Uh, Russ!

01:16.910 --> 01:17.952
Assemble.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.537
To what do we owe
the pleasure?

01:19.621 --> 01:21.122
What's wrong?
Hmm?
What's wrong?
Hmm?

01:21.206 --> 01:23.792
Uh, listen,
things are afoot.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.920
KQED has invited Julia
to do promotion

01:27.003 --> 01:29.380
for "The French Chef" --
eh, radio,

01:29.464 --> 01:32.926
interviews, a TV spot --
in San Francisco.

01:33.009 --> 01:34.344
Oh!

01:34.427 --> 01:35.804
How fabulous!

01:35.887 --> 01:37.180
No.
No, not fabulous.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.765
We have French onion soup
next week.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.141
We have six days to prep.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.185
There's no time --
Onion soup, shmonion soup.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.020
Just reduce it.

01:44.103 --> 01:45.063
That was a soup joke.

01:45.146 --> 01:47.941
Oh, yes.
Eh, it's three days.

01:48.024 --> 01:50.527
Hotel stay, airfare
on their dime.

01:50.610 --> 01:51.986
-Impossible.
-That's what I thought,

01:52.070 --> 01:54.155
but I've got the prepaid
tickets to prove it.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.282
No, I-I mean,
she can't leave right now.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.369
Russell, we are a public
television station.

01:59.452 --> 02:01.579
We do not say no to free.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.832
Then there's Tripp Wilson,
head of programming.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.166
He hates small talk,

02:05.250 --> 02:06.751
hangs up the phone
without saying goodbye.

02:06.835 --> 02:07.877
You'll like him.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.420
And Tate --
I'm drawing a blank

02:09.504 --> 02:11.047
on his last name --
Crawford?

02:11.131 --> 02:13.424
He's the line producer,
and Tom handled the negotiation.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.677
He's very sharp.
Oh, also, the head
of the network --

02:15.760 --> 02:17.846
Al. Take a breath.

02:17.929 --> 02:20.849
Can you write all this
down for me?
Sure.
Can you write all this
down for me?
Sure.

02:20.932 --> 02:24.519
A haiku,
not an epic poem.

02:24.602 --> 02:27.105
No way, not with
Mickey Mantle in the lineup.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.982
He's injured. Again.

02:29.065 --> 02:30.316
And Berra's
called it quits.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.901
The Yankees are toast.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.570
Avis, can I talk
to you?

02:33.653 --> 02:36.239
Sox are gonna win the Series
this year, boys.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.240
I know it.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.117
Hope springs eternal.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.203
Good show today.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.455
It's been so much smoother
having you back.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.584
I hope we can keep it that way
while Julia is gone.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.419
I've broken up the time
Julia will be away

02:49.502 --> 02:52.130
into half-hour and hour-long
segments for us to work through.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.173
The red boxes are hours,
blues are 30 minutes --

02:54.257 --> 02:56.926
Oh, uh, honey, honey, you
remember from the pilot episode

02:57.010 --> 02:58.595
the way Julia likes
to work.

02:58.678 --> 03:01.639
We'll just, you know,
have to feel it out first.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.558
Just a touch
of spontaneity.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.143
I am all for spontaneity,

03:05.226 --> 03:06.936
but can't we schedule
a time for it?

03:08.438 --> 03:09.606
Certainly.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.232
Oh, uh, darling?

03:11.316 --> 03:12.442
Darling.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.027
Blue or...

03:14.110 --> 03:17.196
I'm sorry, Judith,
Paul is trying to blind me.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.698
Can you say that again?

03:18.781 --> 03:20.617
I've scheduled
a book signing for you

03:20.700 --> 03:22.201
on Saturday
for "Mastering."

03:22.285 --> 03:23.703
A book signing?

03:23.786 --> 03:26.623
Well, I do love the way
your scrappy mind works, Judith,

03:26.706 --> 03:29.667
but we purposefully
left Saturday open.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.378
Ooh. No.
Um, tell her it's fine.

03:32.462 --> 03:35.006
We have all day.
We can spare an hour or so.

03:35.089 --> 03:38.134
The book needs you.

03:38.217 --> 03:42.430
On second thought,
count the Childs in.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.265
Paul. Raincoat.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.142
Good. I'll see you there.

03:46.225 --> 03:47.477
Bye-bye, dear.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.645
Bye.
Bye.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.480
Alright.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.150
Uh -- ooh.

03:54.233 --> 03:55.985
That shirt.
Mm-hmm.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.237
You wore it in Marseille
with the buttons undone.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.864
Mm.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.783
After the signing,

04:01.866 --> 04:05.286
I'll take you to this
wonderful gallery in Sausalito.

04:05.370 --> 04:08.665
And from there, we can stroll
to this little bistro

04:08.748 --> 04:11.834
with the most magnificent
artichoke risotto.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.336
Is it artichoke season?

04:13.419 --> 04:15.004
Mm-hmm.
Ooh.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.631
Californian artichokes.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.883
Mm-hmm.
Dripping in butter.

04:18.967 --> 04:22.011
You know, artichokes are
an aphrodisiac.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.681
In ancient Rome, women were
forbidden from eating them,

04:24.764 --> 04:27.350
lest they be tempted
to lift their togas.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.686
Oh, Paul.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.938
Oopsy-daisy.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.156
All these plaid dresses
for summer.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.534
Who wants to look
like a checker board?

04:44.617 --> 04:47.620
Not me.
I am not a game.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.167
How's the San Francisco
trip going?

04:53.251 --> 04:55.628
They're probably
just landing, Mom.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.256
I doubt I'll hear
from them at all.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.716
Unless something goes wrong,

04:59.799 --> 05:02.051
in which case,
it will be my fault.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.387
Don't take your frustration
out on these pleats.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.055
This is your
most flattering dress.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.682
San Francisco was my idea.

05:07.765 --> 05:10.643
I did the work, and they act
like it just happened.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.562
I didn't even get
a thank-you from Russ.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.815
Who's Russ again?
My boss.

05:15.898 --> 05:18.067
Maybe if I were a man
or white,

05:18.151 --> 05:19.652
or better yet,
a white man --

05:19.736 --> 05:21.571
Oh, stop that.

05:21.654 --> 05:24.240
Honey, do you think
it wasn't difficult for me,

05:24.323 --> 05:25.908
or for your father
in med school?

05:25.992 --> 05:27.577
Did you think it was going
to be different for you?

05:27.660 --> 05:28.870
No, I know that
it is difficult.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.329
That is what
I'm talking about.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.248
Even when you agree with me,
you disagree with me.

05:32.331 --> 05:33.791
Your grandma always said,

05:33.875 --> 05:35.793
"I don't want to hear about
how hard it is.

05:35.877 --> 05:39.047
I want to hear what you're
going to do about it."

05:39.130 --> 05:41.007
You know you can't afford
to have a negative attitude.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.467
I don't know why
I ask you anything.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.135
I always know what
you're going to say.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.428
Oh, really?
What's that?

05:45.511 --> 05:48.681
Well, you can't afford
a negative attitude,

05:48.765 --> 05:50.558
a hard head
makes a soft behind...

05:50.641 --> 05:51.768
Mm.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.770
Mm, you just need
to find a good man.

05:53.853 --> 05:57.940
Oh, I knew I had something
I wanted to tell you.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.194
His name's Isaac.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.300
Are we early?

06:24.383 --> 06:26.010
Don't take it personally,
my love.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.679
Californians
don't read.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.848
-Hello.
-Hello.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.476
I apologize for taking up
your Saturday, Les.

06:33.559 --> 06:34.727
Are you kidding?

06:34.811 --> 06:37.271
I'm just trying to avoid
a fire hazard.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.872
Are they all here
for my signing?

06:54.956 --> 06:57.834
I don't think they're here
for the new Hannah Arendt.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.046
Thank you.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.381
Bye-bye.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.341
We absolutely adore
your show.

07:05.424 --> 07:08.094
Oh, thank you, dear.

07:08.177 --> 07:10.012
What recipes
have you tried?

07:10.096 --> 07:11.472
Oh, we don't cook.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.308
Ohh, thank you.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.601
I made this for you.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.862
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.787
Thank you.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.038
Jul?
Hmm?
Jul?
Hmm?

07:36.122 --> 07:37.915
If you don't mind,
I'm going to sneak out

07:37.999 --> 07:39.709
to the gallery
before it closes.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.503
Oh, Paul,
I didn't realize

07:42.587 --> 07:44.922
it was going to turn
into this display.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.382
It's marvelous, kitten.

07:46.465 --> 07:49.302
I'm just itching to explore.
I'll see you at the hotel.

07:49.385 --> 07:51.387
Yes.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.556
Bye, my darling.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.308
All this, for that?

07:55.391 --> 07:56.893
You didn't
expect it, either?

07:56.976 --> 07:58.186
You kidding?

07:58.269 --> 07:59.896
KQED has no means
of measuring our ratings.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.731
There's been positive
feedback, though.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.191
Nearly 24 letters.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.193
So, when do I get
to meet the boss?

08:05.276 --> 08:06.694
Oh, he's not coming.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.279
Alice Naman?

08:08.362 --> 08:09.906
Alice? Right.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.782
Eh, she's back in Boston.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.409
She works for me.

08:13.492 --> 08:15.369
Helluva salesman.
Relentless.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.121
Thought I was
her special guy,

08:17.205 --> 08:19.707
then I get a call
from Chuck Loudermilk
in Philly, WHYY,

08:19.790 --> 08:21.709
the other day asking about
"The French Chef."

08:21.792 --> 08:23.419
Oh, yeah?
What'd you tell him?

08:23.502 --> 08:24.545
Nothing yet.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.380
Waiting to see
how this goes.

08:26.464 --> 08:27.506
Right.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.471
Sign my spatula?

08:33.554 --> 08:35.681
Ohhhhh! Ha-ha!

08:35.765 --> 08:37.683
James!

08:37.767 --> 08:40.853
Oh, what on earth
are you doing here?

08:40.937 --> 08:42.688
Oh, I happened
to be in town,

08:42.772 --> 08:45.316
and I couldn't resist
coming to see you.

08:45.399 --> 08:48.236
Oh, really,
I can't believe it.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.862
It is an honor.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.281
You know I have a soft spot
for tall cooks

08:52.365 --> 08:53.991
with hearty appetites.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.243
Oh.

08:55.326 --> 08:58.287
James Beard, have you
met Judith Jones?

08:58.371 --> 09:02.500
Not officially, no,
but I am a fan.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.794
Thank you.
Likewise.

09:04.877 --> 09:09.173
Well, I'm absolutely gobsmacked
by this turnout.

09:09.257 --> 09:13.636
San Francisco is a town
of sensualists like us,

09:13.719 --> 09:15.805
unlike dreary Boston.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.307
Beans and cod
and the like.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.142
Ugh!
Ugh!

09:20.226 --> 09:21.936
And I'll prove it.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.729
I'm taking you both out
to dinner tonight,

09:23.813 --> 09:25.523
to my favorite restaurant
in the Bay.

09:25.606 --> 09:29.110
The food is spectacular,
the room is charming...

09:29.193 --> 09:31.487
Oh!
...and the waiters
are delicious.

09:31.570 --> 09:34.156
Oh!
Well, I'm sold.

09:35.574 --> 09:37.952
Oh, Paul, my husband,
is in town with me.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.787
Oh, the more
the merrier.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.175
The artist straps himself
into a harness

09:53.259 --> 09:56.554
and paints upside down.

09:56.637 --> 09:58.139
Remarkable.

09:58.222 --> 09:59.849
Can I help you
with anything?

09:59.932 --> 10:02.268
I'm only here to look
and -- and learn.

10:02.351 --> 10:06.355
I'm -- I'm an artist myself,
from Boston.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.108
I paint standing up.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.527
And, uh, what brings you
to San Francisco?

10:11.610 --> 10:14.322
Are you showing in town?

10:14.405 --> 10:17.450
Uh, I'm here with my wife,
actually.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.369
She's promoting
her television program,

10:20.453 --> 10:22.038
"The French Chef."

10:22.121 --> 10:23.497
Have you seen it?

10:26.125 --> 10:28.127
Julia's weapon of choice.

10:30.713 --> 10:31.839
Oh!

10:31.922 --> 10:33.591
Oh, that is nice.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.885
Avis, you really know your way
around this kitchen.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.345
Well, I should.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.889
I found this house
for Julia and Paul.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.849
You know, it's funny.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.435
I actually met Julia
because of knives.

10:44.518 --> 10:45.895
Street fight?

10:45.978 --> 10:47.396
No.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.441
Actually, she wrote a letter
to my husband about knives.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.651
Bernard wrote a column
for Harper's

10:52.735 --> 10:55.529
about the evils
of stainless steel knives.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.199
Julia felt the same and
wrote to him in solidarity.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.826
I was in charge
of Bernard's correspondence,

11:00.910 --> 11:02.036
so I read the letter.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.080
I loved it so much,
I wrote back to her.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.999
And then we became
pen pals.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.501
For a decade.

11:08.584 --> 11:09.877
Ah.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.964
Then when Bernard passed

11:14.048 --> 11:18.177
and my children started to live
their grown-up lives,

11:18.260 --> 11:21.389
I saw myself
turning into that woman.

11:21.472 --> 11:25.017
Hiding behind the curtains
and watching the neighbors,

11:25.101 --> 11:27.478
waiting for "Perry Mason"
to come on,

11:27.561 --> 11:31.357
telling the grandchildren about
the time she was the May Queen.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.275
Oh, you were
the May Queen?

11:36.487 --> 11:41.492
And then Julia moved here,
and life became exciting again.

11:43.619 --> 11:44.954
Ah!

11:46.622 --> 11:49.500
It's the onions.
I swear.

11:49.583 --> 11:50.960
I never cry.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.795
Oh!

11:52.878 --> 11:54.296
Well...

11:54.380 --> 11:57.383
Now we have enough oignon.
Now we have enough oignon.

11:57.466 --> 11:59.802
It's time for the butter.

11:59.885 --> 12:03.305
Let's go easy --
say, eight sticks.

12:04.807 --> 12:10.938
The tiniest splash
of vermouth, for flavor.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.652
Everything is good here.

12:16.735 --> 12:20.906
Wait till you try the bread.
It is a poem.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.617
Oh, thank you.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.911
I just need to make a quick
phone call, so excuse me.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.788
Just one sec.
Oh!

12:30.791 --> 12:32.543
Oh,
Paul didn't answer.

12:32.626 --> 12:35.171
I so wanted him
to come to dinner.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.839
He'd adore
the ambiance.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.090
Well, you tried.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.135
You just checking in
with your husband?

12:41.218 --> 12:43.220
No, the old
ball and chain.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.724
Hello?
It's Judith.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.350
I'm sorry
for calling so late.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.020
You know I don't sleep.
I've been trying to reach you.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.354
I haven't been back
to the hotel.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.023
It's been a wild day.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.817
Did you wake up at noon,
talk about your feelings,

12:56.901 --> 12:58.777
and have a lunch
of fiddly sprouts?

12:58.861 --> 13:01.113
Not exactly.
I have news.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.324
As do I.
You first.

13:03.407 --> 13:06.827
Julia Child's book signing
was packed.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.162
Overcapacity.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.748
We ran out of copies
of "Mastering."

13:10.831 --> 13:13.292
It was like a Beatles concert
or something.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.668
Sounds noisy.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.462
I, however, can do you
one better.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.756
Your boy Updike
has been short-listed

13:18.839 --> 13:21.550
for the National Book Award.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.885
Holy shit!

13:22.968 --> 13:24.970
Fucking right,
holy shit.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.514
Well!

13:26.597 --> 13:32.061
Well, this is very,
very, very exciting.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.688
Um, congratulations.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.858
Congratulations to you,
my dear.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.068
You did that.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.402
Goodnight.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.288
A bottle of the '55
Saint-Emilion

13:51.372 --> 13:53.123
and two martinis.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.334
Anything for you?

13:55.417 --> 13:57.920
Sorry.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.714
I'm worried
I smell like onions.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.800
I'm worried that I will always
smell like onions.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.719
Eau de French Chef.
Mm.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.304
You'll love it here.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.056
Julia and I come here
all the time.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.934
And Paul third-wheels.
And Paul third-wheels.

14:12.017 --> 14:16.480
So, this can't just be my own
personal "This Is Your Life."

14:16.564 --> 14:18.774
Um, why television?

14:20.484 --> 14:23.153
Do you remember the first
episode of "The Twilight Zone"?

14:23.237 --> 14:25.864
I don't remember any episode
of "The Twilight Zone."

14:25.948 --> 14:26.991
Oh!

14:27.074 --> 14:28.617
"There is a fifth dimension

14:28.701 --> 14:30.869
beyond that
which is known to man.

14:30.953 --> 14:34.415
The middle ground between
science and superstition.

14:34.498 --> 14:37.501
It lies between the pit
of man's fears

14:37.585 --> 14:40.087
and the summit
of his knowledge.

14:40.170 --> 14:43.090
The dimension
of imagination."

14:43.173 --> 14:44.633
Ooh!

14:44.717 --> 14:47.469
I knew from the first episode,
television was my future.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.763
Mm.
Endless possibilities.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.265
It's not so easy,
though.

14:51.348 --> 14:54.143
You don't know watching at home
just how hard it is

14:54.226 --> 14:56.812
to make one little
half-hour program.

14:56.895 --> 14:58.772
The tears.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.191
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.196
The mussels are fantastic.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.823
And the steak frites.

15:07.906 --> 15:11.952
Gougères -- delicious
French cheese puffs

15:12.036 --> 15:15.164
that explode in your mouth
like firecrackers.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.124
They're rough
on my stomach.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.334
You've had them?

15:18.417 --> 15:20.336
In Paris, actually.

15:20.419 --> 15:21.712
Huh.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.591
I studied some French
at Oberlin.

15:25.674 --> 15:28.594
My parents took me to Paris
when I graduated.

15:28.677 --> 15:33.182
And here am I, mispronouncing
cheese puffs to you.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.018
Ah. Merci.

15:36.101 --> 15:39.146
After you,
mademoiselle.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.649
La salade paysanne,
s'il vous plait.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.317
I'll have the same.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.777
And French fries.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.195
Oui, madame.

15:49.073 --> 15:52.785
I wonder how they're doing
in San Francisco.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.454
Clever of Russ to sell the show
across the country,

15:55.537 --> 15:57.289
don't you think?

16:00.250 --> 16:03.837
Mind you, there's no place
on earth I'd rather be

16:03.921 --> 16:07.841
than right here with
wunderkind Alice Naman.

16:07.925 --> 16:10.594
Thank you
for joining me.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.596
I hate eating alone.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.266
Me too.

16:21.689 --> 16:26.527
If music be the food of love,
play on.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.779
Give me excess of it.
Give me excess of it.

16:28.862 --> 16:31.949
Well, these shrimp
are the food of love.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.451
Flay on!
Flay on!

16:36.078 --> 16:39.331
Oh, James, you must go
onstage again.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.417
We chefs are
natural performers.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.210
No, do you think so?
Mm!

16:44.628 --> 16:47.005
Well, I was a theater
major in college.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.507
As was I.
Mm!
As was I.
Mm!

16:48.590 --> 16:50.676
No one thought I was
particularly good, I'm afraid,

16:50.759 --> 16:52.636
but I did break
the world record

16:52.720 --> 16:56.598
as Torvald's
tallest little bird.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.183
You played Nora?
Mm!

16:58.267 --> 16:59.476
You like Ibsen?

16:59.560 --> 17:03.021
I loved throwing myself
into characters,

17:03.105 --> 17:05.107
becoming someone else.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.652
Mind you, I always had
an affinity for ham.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.114
Oh, I'm the opposite.

17:12.197 --> 17:16.201
I -- I was only ever
really able to play myself.

17:16.285 --> 17:19.872
Well, it's a very
good part.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.081
Ohh.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.041
Mr. Beard, we're so honored

17:23.125 --> 17:24.877
to welcome you back.
Oh, thank you.
to welcome you back.
Oh, thank you.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.337
Mrs. Child,
I'm a huge fan.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.798
Oh, you're kidding.
Bon appétit.
Oh, you're kidding.
Bon appétit.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.133
Amazing.

17:32.050 --> 17:34.094
Would you like to see
the kitchen?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.734
Julia, could you --

17:59.119 --> 18:00.496
Sorry.

18:19.723 --> 18:23.185
Ooh, it smells
like heaven in here!

18:23.268 --> 18:25.687
Jason grows
all his own herbs.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.022
Oh?
We have a garden
in the back.

18:27.105 --> 18:28.774
It's practically a farm.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.985
Yes, Paul grows our herbs
in the garden, too.

18:32.069 --> 18:37.533
He would especially appreciate
your attention to detail, Jason.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.868
In we go.
Yes.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.245
Mm!

18:42.996 --> 18:44.414
Ooh, yes!
Ohh!
Ooh, yes!
Ohh!

18:44.498 --> 18:45.707
That is exquisite!

18:45.791 --> 18:48.377
Julia,
I could bathe in it.

18:48.460 --> 18:51.046
Oh, my gosh.

18:51.129 --> 18:54.299
I was 21, I had just
graduated college.

18:54.383 --> 18:57.719
We had this makeshift stage,
totally uneven surface.

18:57.803 --> 19:01.181
One of the leads broke her leg
on opening night.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.183
I suppose
you told her to?

19:04.935 --> 19:06.478
She took direction well.

19:07.855 --> 19:11.108
You know,
I translated "The Maids."

19:11.191 --> 19:13.068
Of course I know.

19:13.151 --> 19:15.737
I used your translation.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.906
You know,
it doesn't surprise me at all

19:17.990 --> 19:19.700
that your background's
in theater.

19:19.783 --> 19:22.995
Why?
A gateau isn't exactly Genet.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.418
Some people are simply
meant to be on a stage.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.336
Yes.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.673
Oh, no, sit.
Sit, sit.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.758
Another round.
I've already paid the check.
Another round.
I've already paid the check.

19:36.842 --> 19:40.554
Oh!
Time for Act II
of the evening.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.931
I have a surprise.
I'm beat.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.850
Oh, nonsense.
The night is young.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.102
Alas, I am not as young
as the night,

19:47.185 --> 19:48.729
and I am
three hours ahead.

19:48.812 --> 19:52.024
Julia, this cannot
be missed.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.693
I am putting my foot down.
Please.

19:54.776 --> 19:57.237
Say yes.

19:59.281 --> 20:02.409
Paul, I called earlier --
Oh!

20:02.492 --> 20:03.785
James Beard here.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.496
I need to borrow your wife
for a while longer.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.583
We have an important mission
in the Mission.

20:11.293 --> 20:16.131
Join us if you can,
but there's no time to waste.

20:16.214 --> 20:18.050
Are you up for it?

20:18.133 --> 20:23.096
Uh, you go if you want to,
but I am in for the evening.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.765
Well, I won't
be home late.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.351
Hello?
Ooh, Julia!

20:27.434 --> 20:31.647
It's the city calling.
We have to go, go, go!

20:34.358 --> 20:35.525
Have a good time.

20:35.609 --> 20:36.652
Oh, I love you!

21:02.469 --> 21:06.348
Uh, yes,
Claire Foster, please.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.100
Berkeley, California.

21:23.907 --> 21:27.786
Oh, James.
What is this place?

21:27.869 --> 21:31.123
Welcome to
The Sword and Crown.

21:32.666 --> 21:36.420
Home to
San Francisco royalty.

21:36.503 --> 21:39.172
Screaming queens,
mostly.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.611
Isn't this something?

22:01.695 --> 22:05.532
I always feel like Dorothy
when she lands in Oz.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.659
Finally, some color.

22:07.743 --> 22:10.412
It's indeed colorful.

22:10.495 --> 22:14.249
But you could have given me
some kind of warning.

22:14.332 --> 22:16.251
I was afraid that
you wouldn't come.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.255
You must be parched.

22:20.338 --> 22:21.757
Libations!
Yes.
Libations!
Yes.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.955
I'm Coco.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.373
Coco Van.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.793
Oh.

22:57.876 --> 23:00.754
Are -- Are you...

23:00.837 --> 23:02.506
...me?
Oh!

23:02.589 --> 23:03.882
You've met.

23:03.965 --> 23:06.343
This is
the big surprise.

23:06.426 --> 23:09.304
Can you believe her?

23:09.387 --> 23:11.181
I cannot.

23:11.264 --> 23:14.142
Coco, join us, please.

23:14.226 --> 23:17.395
The second I saw your show,
I had a vision of Coco.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.147
Born the day you made
my namesake dish,

23:19.231 --> 23:20.941
which I cooked
for my mother, by the way.

23:21.024 --> 23:22.651
She was bowled over.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.319
I borrowed her pearls
for tonight.

23:24.402 --> 23:25.987
What do you think?

23:26.071 --> 23:28.782
Oh, they're...

23:28.865 --> 23:30.200
lovely.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.493
Thank you.

23:31.576 --> 23:34.287
And this hairstyle,
I just love.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.872
I traded in my old wig.

23:35.956 --> 23:40.252
My Donna Reed days are over,
and Coco's here to stay.

23:40.335 --> 23:43.880
Now, I must say, Julia,
you are as pretty as a picture.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.383
Just like on TV.

23:46.466 --> 23:48.552
Your makeup is
beautifully done.

23:48.635 --> 23:51.346
The trick is the cheekbones.

23:51.429 --> 23:53.723
See, I made my face
like this...

23:53.807 --> 23:55.684
and then sweep up!

23:55.767 --> 23:57.644
Always up!
Always up!

23:57.727 --> 23:59.104
Makeup's
the fun part.

23:59.187 --> 24:01.356
The hard part
is the shoes.

24:01.439 --> 24:03.024
Finding the right size.
Ugh!

24:03.108 --> 24:04.860
Oh, you're telling me.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.903
Since I was 12.

24:09.447 --> 24:12.492
You know, Achilles was
a drag queen, too?

24:12.576 --> 24:14.578
His heels
were killing him.

24:25.964 --> 24:28.383
I'd like to welcome
our next performer.

24:28.466 --> 24:31.469
She is quite a dish.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.555
Coco Van!

24:44.316 --> 24:48.236
I'd like to dedicate this
to a woman who makes the world

24:48.320 --> 24:52.532
a little sweeter, yummier,
and much wider.

24:53.783 --> 24:56.661
My inspiration --
Julia Child!

25:11.468 --> 25:14.054
Oh, that is funny.
Oh, that is funny.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.611
I'm s--

25:29.694 --> 25:30.904
Who am I kidding?

25:30.987 --> 25:32.614
I can't do this alone.

25:32.697 --> 25:35.492
Julia, get up here!

25:41.706 --> 25:44.793
Oh! Ohh!

25:52.384 --> 25:53.885
Hello.

25:57.055 --> 26:02.352
Ohh.

26:05.313 --> 26:06.982
Oh!

26:31.256 --> 26:33.049
Take that, Donna Reed!

27:03.288 --> 27:06.124
Make a drink?

27:06.207 --> 27:07.876
Okay.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.920
Mm!
Okay.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.839
Mm.
Hmm.
Mm.
Hmm.

27:15.175 --> 27:18.178
Oh, my.
Who put that there?
Oh, my.
Who put that there?

27:18.261 --> 27:20.180
Ah...

27:22.140 --> 27:25.810
A Russian gymnast told me
A Russian gymnast told me

27:25.894 --> 27:30.690
that the key
to preventing a hangover...

27:33.777 --> 27:35.236
...is vodka.

27:43.953 --> 27:45.330
Oh. Oh.

27:45.413 --> 27:48.625
Oh. Oh.

27:48.708 --> 27:51.920
Oh, James.

27:52.003 --> 27:55.507
Perhaps it's time
I tucked you in a cab.

27:55.590 --> 27:58.093
I have a full day tomorrow.
Mm-hmm.
I have a full day tomorrow.
Mm-hmm.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.428
Mm-hmm.

28:03.390 --> 28:04.766
Shh, shh!
Quiet.

28:04.849 --> 28:07.310
Mm. Shh.

28:07.394 --> 28:10.230
Ma.

28:10.313 --> 28:12.690
Ma.

28:12.774 --> 28:14.526
Ralphie?

28:14.609 --> 28:16.152
I met her.

28:18.196 --> 28:19.948
Julia Child.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.451
You what?

28:34.129 --> 28:35.964
Oh, shit.

28:36.047 --> 28:39.008
Oh, I wish Coco were here.

28:39.092 --> 28:40.969
Bless you, Paul.
Coco?

28:41.052 --> 28:42.595
Yes, that was her name.

28:42.679 --> 28:45.515
His name.
The queen.

28:48.977 --> 28:51.104
Are you alright?
Mm.

28:51.187 --> 28:53.857
Yes, I learned this trick
last night.

28:56.818 --> 28:59.154
Seems that San Francisco
has fallen in love with you,

28:59.237 --> 29:00.530
even the fairies.

29:00.613 --> 29:03.199
Oh, I don't know about that,

29:03.283 --> 29:05.160
but it's certainly
the only place on earth

29:05.243 --> 29:08.496
my singing
will ever be applauded.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.332
A standing ovation,
imagine that.

29:11.416 --> 29:12.917
Hmm.
Oh.
Hmm.
Oh.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.795
Did you know Achilles
was a drag queen?

29:16.921 --> 29:20.592
His heels
were killing him.

29:20.675 --> 29:22.927
But it was just
the one heel.

29:26.681 --> 29:30.018
Oh, merde.
I'm late.

29:30.101 --> 29:33.188
Will you come meet me later
at the station?
Mm.
Will you come meet me later
at the station?
Mm.

29:33.271 --> 29:38.234
Well, um...won't James be
there for support?

29:40.153 --> 29:42.447
I could use your support.

29:42.530 --> 29:45.283
I'm busy, actually.

29:45.366 --> 29:46.618
Oh?

29:46.701 --> 29:48.453
I'm having lunch
with Claire.

29:48.536 --> 29:51.247
You've been making
your own plans, so...

29:51.331 --> 29:54.792
Well, that's wonderful.
But I just assumed...

29:54.876 --> 29:56.878
What?

29:56.961 --> 29:58.546
Nothing.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.592
Send her my love.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.387
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.223
The car is...

30:17.732 --> 30:19.651
Duty calls.

30:19.734 --> 30:21.277
Off you go.

30:26.866 --> 30:28.493
Sam has so many
darn patients,

30:28.576 --> 30:30.662
he's on track
to outpace your father.

30:30.745 --> 30:33.957
My dream is they'll open
a practice together.

30:34.040 --> 30:37.043
Dynamic doctor duo.

30:37.126 --> 30:39.629
But where would
the office be?

30:39.712 --> 30:44.092
Close to here, of course.
Your father's is too small.

30:46.344 --> 30:49.764
There's some great space
on Maple Street.

30:52.475 --> 30:54.936
Alice,
are you even listening?

30:56.938 --> 30:59.816
Mom, could you be
more supportive?

30:59.899 --> 31:02.068
Of what?

31:02.151 --> 31:04.946
Of me.

31:05.029 --> 31:08.199
Can't I talk about your brothers
without you getting competitive?

31:08.283 --> 31:09.784
It's not about them.

31:09.867 --> 31:11.953
Mom, it's hard for me
at work.

31:12.036 --> 31:14.664
I have to constantly
explain myself,

31:14.747 --> 31:17.959
who I am,
why I'm there,

31:18.042 --> 31:19.502
and when I come to you,

31:19.586 --> 31:22.213
sometimes, I just want
you to listen.

31:22.297 --> 31:23.923
Oh.

31:24.007 --> 31:25.758
Alice.

31:25.842 --> 31:29.137
I'm your mother,
not your friend.

31:30.930 --> 31:33.975
Let's move those
C-stands over there.

31:34.058 --> 31:37.395
She's quite the sorceress,
isn't she?

31:40.648 --> 31:44.444
I've fallen under
her spell.

31:44.527 --> 31:47.155
You know, when
"Mastering the Art
of French Cooking"

31:47.238 --> 31:48.865
debuted...

31:51.492 --> 31:53.661
I was quite jealous.

31:53.745 --> 31:57.332
Not only of the idea,
the scope of it,

31:57.415 --> 31:59.876
but the voice.

31:59.959 --> 32:03.963
Even the title, the gerund --
it invites you in.

32:04.047 --> 32:06.674
That was your idea,
the title, yes?

32:06.758 --> 32:08.009
Mm.

32:08.092 --> 32:11.137
I want my cookbooks
to sing like that,

32:11.220 --> 32:13.139
Judith,
and I need your help.

32:13.222 --> 32:15.475
Do mine next.
Oh.
Do mine next.
Oh.

32:15.558 --> 32:19.687
James, I'm flattered,
but that's not what I do.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.856
Well, that's quite clearly
what you do.

32:21.939 --> 32:23.608
Oh. No.

32:23.691 --> 32:27.028
I'm a fiction editor
who happens to --

32:27.111 --> 32:28.613
how did you put it?

32:28.696 --> 32:30.198
Uh...

32:30.281 --> 32:32.575
...have fallen under
Julia's spell.

32:32.659 --> 32:36.287
I edit Julia Child,
not cookbooks.

32:36.371 --> 32:39.248
I am not
a-a cookbook editor.

32:41.376 --> 32:43.836
Places, everyone.
One minute to go.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.422
We should find
our seats.

32:46.506 --> 32:49.384
Live audience members can
go ahead and take your seats.

32:49.467 --> 32:52.387
Let's move cameras to marks
and fly equipment out.

32:54.681 --> 32:57.642
This is a universal
crepe batter.

32:57.725 --> 33:02.939
You may add spices to the mix
if you like, or nutmeg.

33:03.022 --> 33:05.149
Good wrist work, Ken.

33:05.233 --> 33:07.235
I can see you've had
plenty of practice.

33:08.861 --> 33:11.948
Have you made crepes
like this before, Ken?

33:12.031 --> 33:14.575
Haven't used a hot plate
since chemistry class.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.994
Oh, well, cooking is just
like chemistry,

33:17.078 --> 33:20.832
but we are encouraged
to lick the instruments.

33:23.334 --> 33:26.045
Oh, Ken,
if you can assist me.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.596
Kenny, Kenny.

33:35.680 --> 33:39.434
Ooh, you're not afraid
of a little flame, are you?

33:39.517 --> 33:41.644
Didn't I read that
your television station

33:41.728 --> 33:42.812
burned to the ground?

33:42.895 --> 33:44.772
Oh, that's before
my time, dear.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.233
Before my time.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.947
This is great
television.

33:53.030 --> 33:55.950
Well, if lily-livered Ken
won't help me

33:56.033 --> 33:58.953
complete my show-stopper,
perhaps my dear friend

33:59.036 --> 34:00.997
James Beard
will come to the rescue?

34:01.080 --> 34:04.667
James Beard, everyone!
James Beard, everyone!

34:08.588 --> 34:12.008
My hero.
My hero.

34:12.091 --> 34:14.552
And now, we flambé!

34:17.930 --> 34:20.683
Julia, did you know
that Crepes Suzette

34:20.767 --> 34:22.310
were created by mistake?

34:22.393 --> 34:26.481
A waiter accidentally
set fire to --

34:26.564 --> 34:27.732
Suzette.

34:31.152 --> 34:33.821
A little bit of the sauce
on top of it.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.281
Thank you, James.

34:35.364 --> 34:39.827
And there she is --
Miss Crepes Suzette.

34:42.747 --> 34:48.169
Remember to tune in to
"The French Chef" on KQED.

34:49.921 --> 34:51.589
Ah.
There you are.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.174
Oh!

34:53.257 --> 34:56.177
Teaching America how to cook
is hard work, I see.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.679
Those lights were
awfully hot.

34:58.763 --> 35:01.724
Anyway, I'd best be off.
I have a plane to catch.

35:01.808 --> 35:04.435
Oh, so soon?
You came all this way.

35:04.519 --> 35:06.562
Don't you want to play
awhile longer?

35:07.897 --> 35:09.315
No more play for me.

35:09.398 --> 35:12.068
Julialand is the most
entertaining place,

35:12.151 --> 35:14.695
but there is a mile-high
stack of novels

35:14.779 --> 35:17.198
in my office
calling me away.

35:17.281 --> 35:18.699
It's good.

35:18.783 --> 35:21.828
It's my work.

35:21.911 --> 35:26.374
Somehow, I always feel
replenished after time with you.

35:26.457 --> 35:29.210
And my pants,
always a little tighter.

35:34.173 --> 35:35.842
Russ, I'll see you
back there.
Yeah. Okay.
Russ, I'll see you
back there.
Yeah. Okay.

35:35.925 --> 35:39.053
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, that's great.

35:39.136 --> 35:41.097
She killed on the radio
this morning, too.

35:41.180 --> 35:42.723
I loved the bit
about iceboxes.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.517
I never call them
"refrigerators" either.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.060
Who has the time?

35:46.143 --> 35:48.354
You really got something.
It's funny.

35:48.437 --> 35:50.690
I didn't understand it at all
till this weekend.

35:50.773 --> 35:53.192
A cooking show?
With her as host?

35:53.276 --> 35:55.319
I don't think we've seen
anything quite like this.

35:55.403 --> 35:58.072
Oh, and Russ,
I spoke with Philly.

35:58.155 --> 36:00.157
Expect a call.
Oh.

36:00.241 --> 36:01.534
Thank you.
Great.

36:01.617 --> 36:04.203
How did you come up
with "The French Chef"?

36:04.287 --> 36:06.622
I mean,
how did you know?

36:06.706 --> 36:08.082
I didn't.

36:08.165 --> 36:10.251
I had no idea.

36:10.334 --> 36:14.338
I think my mother would
have loved "The French Chef."

36:14.422 --> 36:15.923
Oh, Edith
with a television?

36:16.007 --> 36:18.092
Can you imagine?

36:18.175 --> 36:21.971
She was too busy
to sit still long enough.

36:22.054 --> 36:24.765
You know, when she
was bedridden,

36:24.849 --> 36:26.183
I would draw for her,

36:26.267 --> 36:28.853
just so she would have
something to critique.

36:28.936 --> 36:32.481
She lived to deliver
pithy barbs.

36:32.565 --> 36:36.277
My work gave her
ample opportunity.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.614
But I loved her, so...

36:39.697 --> 36:42.617
I'm sorry that I haven't
been able to visit you,

36:42.700 --> 36:44.410
or Robert,
as much as I'd like.

36:44.493 --> 36:47.246
You've always been there
for both of us.

36:47.330 --> 36:50.291
And now Julia's right there
in my living room.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.959
I'm surprised
there has been

36:52.043 --> 36:54.462
such a big response
to the series here.

36:54.545 --> 36:55.713
You shouldn't be.

36:55.796 --> 36:58.966
In San Francisco,
food is everything.

36:59.884 --> 37:03.137
It's one of the things
I love most about this city.

37:04.972 --> 37:08.351
You've departed
to Gloomsville.

37:08.434 --> 37:12.939
Peter is being transferred
to the head office in Chicago.

37:13.022 --> 37:16.651
Promoted, rather.
It's a great opportunity...

37:16.734 --> 37:18.486
But you don't want to leave
San Francisco?

37:18.569 --> 37:22.073
For what?
Pizza pie and Polish sausages?

37:22.156 --> 37:24.408
Polish sausages
are magnificent.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.160
The egg buns
with poppy seeds.

37:26.243 --> 37:27.912
They get stuck
in my teeth.

37:27.995 --> 37:29.330
Ah.

37:29.413 --> 37:30.998
Oh, I am being unfair.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.793
It's his dream,
after all.

37:33.876 --> 37:38.339
But I just wasn't expecting
such upheaval in my life,

37:38.422 --> 37:40.007
not at this age.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.676
I'm settled.

37:41.759 --> 37:44.679
I'm cooked.

37:44.762 --> 37:47.056
Believe me, I understand.

37:47.139 --> 37:48.891
You and Julia moved
all over the world.

37:48.975 --> 37:51.352
That must have been hard,
especially for her.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.229
Oh, she loved it.

37:58.943 --> 38:03.322
Well, I think it's sweet
that you're here supporting her.

38:03.406 --> 38:06.492
I've always admired
you two.

38:06.575 --> 38:10.329
I'm so happy you found her
after Mother passed.

38:16.877 --> 38:19.714
Don't worry
about the move.

38:19.797 --> 38:23.134
The world works
in mysterious ways.

38:23.217 --> 38:25.344
Nothing is predictable.

38:25.428 --> 38:29.181
And the good thing
about love...

38:29.265 --> 38:31.142
is that it travels.

38:33.978 --> 38:37.064
Though, it can be
extremely inconsiderate,

38:37.148 --> 38:39.191
occasionally
self-centered.

38:46.532 --> 38:49.952
It's very kind of you
to escort me home, James.

38:50.036 --> 38:53.205
Thank you for being
my knight in shining armor.

38:53.289 --> 38:54.999
Ken was not very helpful.

38:55.082 --> 38:57.126
The handsome ones
never are.

39:00.755 --> 39:03.549
You know...

39:03.632 --> 39:05.509
I had a cooking show once.

39:05.593 --> 39:07.053
Oh?

39:07.136 --> 39:08.888
I must have been
in France.

39:08.971 --> 39:10.848
Didn't do very well.

39:10.931 --> 39:13.476
Oh, bad timing,
I'm sure.

39:13.559 --> 39:16.771
No.
It wasn't that.

39:16.854 --> 39:22.443
America can't love a fat
old fairy like me.

39:23.944 --> 39:25.905
Oh, James.

39:25.988 --> 39:27.698
No.

39:29.283 --> 39:31.994
You, on the other hand,
make people very happy,

39:32.078 --> 39:33.913
including me.

39:33.996 --> 39:36.957
Now, there's a wonderful
vineyard just outside of Marin

39:37.041 --> 39:38.626
with an unbelievable Syrah,

39:38.709 --> 39:40.461
better than anything
from the Rhone Valley.

39:40.544 --> 39:43.589
It will
knock your socks off.

39:43.672 --> 39:47.802
It is oh-so-tempting,
my darling James,

39:47.885 --> 39:49.178
but I think I have to go.

39:49.261 --> 39:50.513
Yes.
Of course, of course.

39:50.596 --> 39:53.307
Go up and change,
grab Paul, I'll wait.

39:53.390 --> 39:55.393
No, I'm sorry, I can't.

39:58.479 --> 40:01.107
Lucky man, Paul Child.

40:05.027 --> 40:07.029
But you can't shake me
that easily.

40:07.113 --> 40:09.406
Next we'll take on
New York.

40:09.490 --> 40:12.451
Or
even dreary Boston.

40:21.544 --> 40:23.420
Thank you so much.
Thanks, ma'am.
Thank you so much.
Thanks, ma'am.

40:30.719 --> 40:32.096
Where to?

40:32.179 --> 40:34.515
Um...

40:34.598 --> 40:36.475
19th and Diamond Street.

40:44.316 --> 40:46.193
Paul?

40:49.613 --> 40:51.198
Paul, are you here?

40:58.289 --> 41:00.040
Paul?

41:10.009 --> 41:11.552
You're here.

41:14.138 --> 41:15.723
I missed you.

41:15.806 --> 41:17.391
Who are you, again?

41:17.474 --> 41:19.643
Oh, Paul, don't.

41:23.814 --> 41:26.150
I'll freshen up
and then we can go

41:26.233 --> 41:27.943
to the bistro
you mentioned.

41:28.027 --> 41:31.614
Oh, uh, I-I went there
with Claire today.

41:32.615 --> 41:34.533
Oh.

41:34.617 --> 41:36.327
Well,
somewhere else, then.

41:36.410 --> 41:37.870
Mm.

41:37.953 --> 41:40.247
I don't feel
like going out.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.583
On our last night?

41:42.666 --> 41:45.377
Oh, really, Paul,
let's do something.

41:48.839 --> 41:52.343
You were dynamite
on "Good Day by the Bay."

41:52.426 --> 41:55.971
Oh, you watched?
Of course.

41:56.055 --> 41:58.432
I know this weekend wasn't
what we pictured.

41:58.515 --> 42:02.269
I-I got carried away.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.438
Everyone wants you.

42:04.521 --> 42:07.149
And I can hardly
blame them.

42:07.233 --> 42:08.609
I do, too.

42:10.444 --> 42:12.446
Room service?

42:12.529 --> 42:14.114
Oh, yes.

42:14.198 --> 42:15.741
Oh, Paul, are you sure?

42:15.824 --> 42:18.535
Oh, yes.

42:29.046 --> 42:33.384
It's very strange to go from
no one to someone all at once.

42:33.467 --> 42:36.428
I suppose I'll have to
get used to sharing you.

42:36.512 --> 42:38.138
Ooh, split a Caesar?

42:38.222 --> 42:40.224
No, I don't want that.
Oh.

42:40.307 --> 42:42.643
I mean, yes to Caesar,
no to sharing.

42:42.726 --> 42:46.438
No to me being shared,
yes to sharing the salad.

42:46.522 --> 42:48.649
We'll navigate it
together.

42:48.732 --> 42:51.819
See, I don't quite understand
what's happening.

42:51.902 --> 42:53.612
See, I thought it was scary
at first,

42:53.696 --> 42:55.739
I didn't like it,
but now...

42:57.741 --> 42:59.159
...part of me
does like it.

42:59.243 --> 43:00.327
Mm.
A lot.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.705
Mm.
All those people.

43:02.788 --> 43:05.332
It's exciting.

43:05.416 --> 43:08.877
Oh, I can't help it.
Something is happening.

43:08.961 --> 43:11.547
Something is definitely
happening.

43:11.630 --> 43:14.758
But we're still us.

43:14.842 --> 43:16.927
We have to stay us.

43:17.011 --> 43:18.846
Otherwise,
there's no point.

43:18.929 --> 43:21.473
Hm.

43:25.394 --> 43:29.523
Oh, Julie,
they have sole meuniere.

43:32.443 --> 43:34.361
Lovely.
