00:31.291 --> 00:32.583
<i>In a time of dread,</i>

00:33.541 --> 00:34.875
<i>a child was born.</i>

00:36.375 --> 00:40.041
<i>Elora Danan,</i>
<i>destined to save our world.</i>

00:41.375 --> 00:44.125
<i>Relentlessly pursued</i>
<i>by the forces of darkness,</i>

00:44.208 --> 00:47.708
<i>Elora was rescued by two unlikely heroes.</i>

00:48.500 --> 00:49.833
<i>A Nelwyn farmer</i>

00:49.916 --> 00:51.541
<i>-who dreamt of being a sorcerer.</i>

00:51.625 --> 00:55.958
<i>Willow was a man of pure heart</i>
<i>and unfailing courage.</i>

00:56.875 --> 00:59.208
<i>-The other...</i>

00:59.291 --> 01:03.291
<i>...an impossibly conceited thief,</i>
<i>liar, and rogue.</i>

01:05.166 --> 01:07.291
<i>Madmartigan was the man I'd marry.</i>

01:08.875 --> 01:10.000
<i>What can I say?</i>

01:11.708 --> 01:13.791
<i>I was young.</i>

01:18.000 --> 01:21.250
<i>Together, we defeated my mother,</i>
<i>Queen Bavmorda.</i>

01:21.333 --> 01:23.125
-<i>And freed the Kingdom</i>

01:23.208 --> 01:26.083
<i>-of Tir Asleen from its curse.</i>

01:31.083 --> 01:32.916
<i>We thought the war was over.</i>

01:33.708 --> 01:35.458
<i>But soon after returning home,</i>

01:36.791 --> 01:38.416
<i>-Willow had a vision.</i>

01:41.500 --> 01:42.625
<i>That one day,</i>

01:43.166 --> 01:47.791
<i>an ancient evil would rise again</i>
<i>and destroy the future Empress,</i>

01:47.875 --> 01:50.750
<i>and her end would herald a new dark age.</i>

01:52.208 --> 01:55.125
<i>And so, Elora was hidden away,</i>

01:55.208 --> 01:57.125
<i>her true identity concealed,</i>

01:58.708 --> 01:59.833
<i>even from herself.</i>

02:01.333 --> 02:03.583
<i>It was the only way I could protect her.</i>

02:36.958 --> 02:38.000
I almost had you.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.125
Don't beat yourself up about it.

02:41.916 --> 02:43.000
You know, there's skill,

02:44.083 --> 02:45.083
then there's talent.

02:45.583 --> 02:46.708
I just happen to have both.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.583
Along with a generous amount of arrogance.

02:49.208 --> 02:50.250
Gotta have that too.

02:51.833 --> 02:54.041
Who knows?
In a few years, you might beat me.

02:54.125 --> 02:57.375
I would have beaten you
if it wasn't for that loose rock.

02:57.458 --> 02:59.500
It's not about
mastering the moves, Jade,

02:59.583 --> 03:01.416
it's about adapting to your terrain.

03:02.083 --> 03:04.375
And, uh,
I'm just better at that than you are.

03:04.458 --> 03:07.333
Yeah, superior in every way,
Your Highness.

03:09.041 --> 03:10.916
One day, I'm gonna prove it.

03:13.291 --> 03:15.375
Tell me you don't still think about that.

03:16.541 --> 03:18.458
You know, going beyond the Barrier,

03:18.541 --> 03:21.625
having these wild adventures like...

03:23.958 --> 03:25.250
we've always talked about.

03:29.875 --> 03:31.750
Kit, I spoke to Ballantine earlier...

03:32.958 --> 03:33.958
-Yeah?
-Princess!

03:35.041 --> 03:36.333
I bring word from the Queen.

03:36.416 --> 03:37.958
Are we under siege?

03:38.041 --> 03:39.583
You need to get dressed for dinner.

03:40.250 --> 03:43.666
Her Highness expects the royal party
from Galladoorn to arrive shortly.

03:43.750 --> 03:46.708
I take it my brother's been called on too,
to scrub behind his ears?

03:46.791 --> 03:51.666
Yes. The prince, I believe,
is hunting in the Western Wood.

03:51.750 --> 03:54.083
Hunting?
I wonder who he's hunting today.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.500
Was that too much?

04:07.583 --> 04:08.583
No. It was, uh...

04:09.666 --> 04:10.958
-You're trembling.
-Am I?

04:11.041 --> 04:13.791
-Yeah.
-I don't know. You just,

04:13.875 --> 04:15.500
you have this effect on me.

04:15.583 --> 04:19.791
It's just like nothing
I've ever experienced before.

04:19.875 --> 04:20.958
Me too.

04:21.041 --> 04:23.041
Just didn't think
you felt that way about me.

04:24.250 --> 04:26.333
-What do you mean? Why not?

04:27.208 --> 04:29.541
You've got a bit of a reputation.

04:29.625 --> 04:31.625
If you heard the things
they say about you,

04:31.708 --> 04:33.083
things I know aren't true.

04:35.791 --> 04:38.416
Some of them might be true.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.916
But that was before. That was before.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.708
I'm not that guy anymore.

04:44.791 --> 04:45.791
Airk, I love you.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.291
-Your Lordship.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.333
-Kase. Excellent scowling.

04:54.416 --> 04:57.750
Trudging across the Western Reach
looking for you,

04:57.833 --> 04:59.708
just how I'd hoped to spend the afternoon.

04:59.791 --> 05:01.375
-I do what I can for my friends.

05:01.458 --> 05:04.625
King Hastur, with a great host,
were seen riding into the Vale.

05:04.708 --> 05:06.500
They'll get to Tir Asleen by dusk.

05:06.583 --> 05:10.500
I'm afraid your mother insists
you're presentable when they arrive.

05:10.583 --> 05:12.833
And what do we suppose
she means by "presentable"?

05:12.916 --> 05:15.750
Well, I suppose
not covered in dirt and grass.

05:15.833 --> 05:17.583
Ah, well, she's so particular.

05:36.583 --> 05:38.250
I'll take Eclipse to the stables.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.083
You know you're coming tonight, right?

05:40.583 --> 05:41.583
-No.
-Yeah.

05:41.666 --> 05:42.833
-Really?
-Yeah.

05:42.916 --> 05:45.375
You know how I feel
about gowns and wearing them.

05:45.458 --> 05:46.791
You're gonna have to suck it up,

05:46.875 --> 05:50.125
because I'm not gonna be able to
survive this thing without you.

05:50.625 --> 05:52.666
-What did you wanna tell me?
-When?

05:52.750 --> 05:54.875
Before, you said you talked to Ballantine.

05:55.333 --> 05:57.125
-Yeah. We can talk about it later.

05:59.458 --> 06:00.666
All right, that was fun.

06:04.541 --> 06:06.333
-Yeah, bye. Bye.

06:06.416 --> 06:07.416
-One more.
-Oh. Mmm-hmm.

06:08.458 --> 06:09.666
-Okay, okay, you gotta go.
-Okay.

06:09.750 --> 06:10.958
-You really gotta go.

06:17.208 --> 06:18.625
-You saw nothing.

06:18.708 --> 06:20.125
I saw everything.

06:20.208 --> 06:21.375
That's the kitchen maid, right?

06:21.458 --> 06:23.833
That makes those buttered muffins
everybody always talks about?

06:23.916 --> 06:25.708
I happen to be a great admirer
of her muffins.

06:25.791 --> 06:28.458
I'm concerned about
what she's gonna put in those muffins

06:28.541 --> 06:29.833
when you inevitably break her heart.

06:29.916 --> 06:31.250
I'm not gonna break her heart.

06:31.333 --> 06:33.291
Please. Airk,
you're gonna lose interest...

06:33.375 --> 06:34.750
-Thanks.
-...and move on to the next.

06:34.833 --> 06:36.916
It's like the one way
you're totally consistent.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.541
No, she... Dove...

06:39.166 --> 06:41.750
It's different,
Dove has this ineffable human quality

06:41.833 --> 06:43.750
-about her soul.
-Whoa, whoa, wait, you said Dove?

06:43.833 --> 06:47.166
Dove. Yes. That's what I call her,
like the most romantic, beautiful...

06:47.250 --> 06:48.250
You don't know her name?

06:48.791 --> 06:50.000
-I know her name.
-Yeah?

06:50.083 --> 06:51.083
-Yeah.
-What is it?

06:52.375 --> 06:54.166
Ah, Mother! We got your message.

06:54.250 --> 06:56.541
We raced back, we're gonna...

06:56.625 --> 06:57.625
We're gonna wash up...

06:57.708 --> 07:00.083
Why do you look like
you've been rolling around in grass?

07:00.875 --> 07:02.625
Training. Tourneys and such.

07:02.708 --> 07:04.083
What's that on your neck?

07:04.916 --> 07:07.500
Oh! I got bit by a fire moth,
which was strange.

07:07.583 --> 07:08.958
Sure it wasn't a dove?

07:09.041 --> 07:12.166
Lachlan told me he found you
and Jade atop of the Canyon Maze again.

07:12.250 --> 07:14.750
I don't like you playing on those rocks.
It's dangerous.

07:14.833 --> 07:17.875
Playing?
Unlike him, we actually were training.

07:17.958 --> 07:19.625
I've had them draw you a bath,

07:20.250 --> 07:22.333
and I've laid out a gown for you to wear.

07:23.458 --> 07:25.208
You're picking out my clothes now?

07:26.875 --> 07:28.041
What am I, six years old?

07:28.125 --> 07:29.125
I shouldn't have to,

07:29.208 --> 07:33.375
but when you neglect your responsibilities
for your hobbies, you leave me no choice.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.166
Okay, we're going, we're going.

07:40.250 --> 07:41.458
Kit. Kit! Come on!

07:49.666 --> 07:50.875
<i>Sorsha.</i>

07:52.375 --> 07:53.791
<i>The Gales.</i>

07:54.791 --> 07:56.291
<i>They are coming.</i>

08:22.583 --> 08:24.750
My lady.

08:24.833 --> 08:27.000
Don't. Ballantine, don't.

08:28.083 --> 08:30.958
For Kit, and only Kit,
do I endure this agony.

08:31.458 --> 08:33.208
Have you told her yet?

08:34.208 --> 08:36.166
-Jade?
-I am going to.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.750
This is what you've always wanted,

08:37.833 --> 08:40.291
what you've worked for,
harder than anyone I've ever known.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.916
If she's really your friend,
she'll be happy for you.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.125
She'll feel like I'm abandoning her
when she needs me the most.

08:47.333 --> 08:48.333
Because I am.

08:50.541 --> 08:51.625
Thank you.

09:00.375 --> 09:01.375
Graydon Hastur,

09:02.041 --> 09:03.750
-the prince of Galladoorn.

09:03.833 --> 09:05.333
I thought there was two of them.

09:05.416 --> 09:08.041
There were two,
but one of them fell out of a tree.

09:09.583 --> 09:10.791
So I have to marry that one.

09:10.875 --> 09:12.958
-Have you spoken to him?
-Yes.

09:13.041 --> 09:17.708
-I curtsied, like a real lady.
-Hmm.

09:17.791 --> 09:21.500
And then he sort of grunted
and shuffled his feet,

09:21.583 --> 09:23.000
like a real...

09:24.125 --> 09:25.125
winner.

09:25.708 --> 09:28.875
You were saying, skirmishes in the west,
beyond the Barrier.

09:28.958 --> 09:30.458
Bone Reaver scum.

09:30.541 --> 09:32.416
Nothing to worry yourself about.

09:32.500 --> 09:35.000
Except I've had similar reports
from the north.

09:35.083 --> 09:36.916
Settlements torched and abandoned.

09:37.375 --> 09:38.791
What if it's something else?

09:38.875 --> 09:42.125
Nonsense. Nothing gets through
the Barrier, ever.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.541
Here you go.
I do pretty much everything around here.

09:47.083 --> 09:50.541
I cook, I clean, I heal the sick.
I actually made the wine.

09:50.625 --> 09:51.708
-Mmm.
-There you go.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.875
You know, they say you're
quite the swordsman too.

09:53.958 --> 09:55.000
Best in Tir Asleen.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.708
Pfft, no, no. Definitely, not the best.

09:57.791 --> 09:59.083
-Hmm.
-Second best.

10:02.333 --> 10:05.083
My dad, he was great.

10:05.166 --> 10:06.583
He was a knight of Galladoorn.

10:06.666 --> 10:07.916
-What? Madmartigan.
-Yeah.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.916
We all grew up on the stories
of your parents,

10:10.000 --> 10:11.916
how they rescued Elora Danan
from Queen Bavmorda

10:12.000 --> 10:13.125
in the Battle of Nockmaar and

10:13.250 --> 10:15.041
-took care of her before she went away.
-Oi!

10:15.125 --> 10:18.833
You're supposed to be watching
the ovens, not gawking at the high borns.

10:19.958 --> 10:21.208
Think that countess is pretty?

10:21.916 --> 10:23.375
The one with the lips and the face?

10:23.458 --> 10:25.666
-Hmm.
-Oh, don't be obvious.

10:34.375 --> 10:37.791
Nobles of the realm,
the Queen!

10:39.916 --> 10:42.875
Two-hundred moons
since the Knights of Galladoorn

10:42.958 --> 10:47.000
vanquished Bavmorda's legions
and freed Tir Asleen from its curse.

10:47.958 --> 10:49.750
And for two-hundred moons,

10:50.166 --> 10:52.333
we've maintained a civil alliance,

10:53.500 --> 10:57.125
governing with mutual consent,
while preserving our autonomy.

10:57.666 --> 11:00.500
One realm, separate kingdoms.

11:02.375 --> 11:03.375
Until now.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.500
Tomorrow, Prince Graydon
marries my daughter, Kit.

11:08.333 --> 11:11.208
At last unifying Tir Asleen
and Galladoorn,

11:11.541 --> 11:14.291
ensuring us a harmonious future,

11:14.750 --> 11:19.166
and strengthening us against
any threat we might face.

11:20.916 --> 11:21.916
To the bride and groom,

11:22.000 --> 11:25.291
may they rule wisely and justly,

11:25.375 --> 11:27.833
and defend our realm till that day

11:27.916 --> 11:30.958
when the true empress Elora Danan returns.

11:31.041 --> 11:32.416
Till that day!

11:32.833 --> 11:35.791
Till that day! Till that day!

11:44.375 --> 11:46.916
<i>The shadow lengthens.</i>

11:47.541 --> 11:51.916
<i>Only by her light can we find</i>
<i>our way in the darkness.</i>

11:52.000 --> 11:56.208
<i>The Gales, they are coming.</i>

12:11.875 --> 12:12.916
How's the party?

12:13.625 --> 12:14.791
You should see the prince.

12:16.458 --> 12:17.583
He's a mouse.

12:17.666 --> 12:18.666
Kit shouldn't have to...

12:18.791 --> 12:21.708
We both know
how fond I am of our little chats,

12:21.791 --> 12:24.708
but unless it's to bring me
a slice of cake, why are you down here?

12:27.708 --> 12:29.041
Maybe it's because you want me

12:29.125 --> 12:32.458
to tell you not to force
your daughter into a loveless marriage.

12:32.541 --> 12:34.125
You know I don't have a choice.

12:34.791 --> 12:37.666
You married Madmartigan.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.625
Nothing easy about that choice,

12:40.708 --> 12:42.833
but at least you made it
for the right reasons.

12:44.875 --> 12:47.875
Everything I've done,
I've done to protect the people I love.

12:50.333 --> 12:51.333
It costs a lot.

12:54.750 --> 12:55.750
I'm tired.

12:56.875 --> 12:58.791
How long can you keep it up?

13:01.041 --> 13:03.291
As long as I have to.

13:07.166 --> 13:08.750
I mean, maybe I'm overreacting.

13:09.625 --> 13:11.791
It doesn't mean
that our life has to change.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.875
We can still ride and...

13:14.958 --> 13:17.333
Ballantine submitted
a petition on my behalf.

13:18.708 --> 13:21.541
I've been accepted to train
with the Shining Legion, Kit.

13:22.916 --> 13:24.500
To become a Knight of Galladoorn.

13:26.125 --> 13:27.750
But they don't take...

13:27.833 --> 13:29.166
They've made an exception.

13:31.875 --> 13:33.416
It's their first ever, actually.

13:35.750 --> 13:38.791
I have to go south with King Hastur
after the wedding.

13:38.875 --> 13:39.875
My wedding?

13:41.083 --> 13:42.083
Tomorrow?

13:42.166 --> 13:44.416
I wanted to tell you before
but I didn't know how to...

13:46.208 --> 13:48.250
Kit. Kit, stop.

13:54.791 --> 13:55.916
Hey!

13:56.000 --> 13:58.416
So, we're getting married.

14:00.916 --> 14:02.458
That's weird, right?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.500
Uh, I'm looking forward to it.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.875
Why? You don't even know me.

14:11.708 --> 14:14.750
I am grateful for the opportunity
to serve the realm.

14:15.458 --> 14:16.500
Sorry. Excuse us.

14:16.583 --> 14:19.000
I am getting acquainted
with my betrothed here,

14:19.666 --> 14:22.041
but you can go wherever you want,

14:23.458 --> 14:24.833
as you've made abundantly clear.

14:27.416 --> 14:29.666
Have you ever heard the story of Taramis?

14:31.208 --> 14:35.333
She was a princess of Cashmere
thousands of years ago,

14:35.416 --> 14:40.666
and she was, like, by all accounts, like,
the most gorgeous woman that ever lived.

14:41.666 --> 14:45.833
So, the King invited all the knights
and all of the princes

14:45.916 --> 14:48.541
to compete for her hand.

14:50.125 --> 14:53.500
The winner of each event advancing
to the next until two remained.

14:53.583 --> 14:56.708
This cocky young knight of Galladoorn

14:57.625 --> 15:00.875
and this helmeted warrior from some
far off distant land

15:00.958 --> 15:02.625
who's face no one had yet seen.

15:02.708 --> 15:06.416
And after a fierce battle,
our mysterious stranger bested the knight,

15:06.500 --> 15:07.750
then removed his helmet.

15:10.958 --> 15:12.333
Can you guess who that was?

15:14.375 --> 15:16.250
It was Princess Taramis.

15:18.666 --> 15:21.291
Secretly entered the tournament
to fight for herself,

15:22.250 --> 15:25.958
for a chance to, to choose her own future.

15:28.416 --> 15:30.875
Sis, just a quick word, please?

15:30.958 --> 15:32.916
-I tried that.
-Make yourself useful.

15:36.083 --> 15:38.416
Say there was a tournament for my hand,

15:38.500 --> 15:40.666
we were competing.
Do you think you would win?

15:41.875 --> 15:42.875
You want me to...

15:42.958 --> 15:45.041
What? Scared you might
blind my pretty twin brother?

15:45.125 --> 15:46.458
I'm worried about that.

15:50.708 --> 15:51.708
Perhaps not.

15:53.291 --> 15:55.416
Mmm, wouldn't wanna miss.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.625
You embarrassed the prince.

16:03.708 --> 16:05.125
-Let go of me.
-You embarrassed me.

16:05.208 --> 16:06.208
I don't care.

16:06.291 --> 16:08.500
You showed everyone in that room
who you are,

16:08.583 --> 16:10.291
a petulant child who needs to grow up.

16:10.375 --> 16:13.541
I'm a prisoner,
sentenced to a life I didn't even choose.

16:13.625 --> 16:15.583
No one chooses their life, Kit.

16:15.666 --> 16:17.333
-Or their mom.
-That's right.

16:17.416 --> 16:19.208
You think I'm tough,
you should've met mine.

16:19.291 --> 16:20.791
It's fine. It's fine. Everything's fine.

16:20.875 --> 16:22.083
I spoke to Graydon,

16:22.166 --> 16:24.916
who is actually not such a terrible guy
if you get to know him.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.041
He'll talk to the King,
smooth things over...

16:27.125 --> 16:28.958
I think you should stick to chasing girls

16:29.500 --> 16:33.125
rather than sticking your nose in matters
that you're incapable of understanding

16:33.208 --> 16:34.916
and are not your concern!

16:42.083 --> 16:43.250
Go to bed, both of you.

16:43.708 --> 16:46.583
In the morning, you will apologize
to the King and the Prince,

16:47.791 --> 16:49.625
and then you will marry him.

17:00.166 --> 17:01.625
What do you think you're doing?

17:02.250 --> 17:05.875
Huh? Oh, are you gonna beat me up?
Because I'm a little tired after that.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.125
I didn't ask for your help.

17:07.208 --> 17:10.541
No. But you're gonna get it anyway
because you're my sister, and I love you,

17:10.625 --> 17:12.083
despite your winning personality.

17:12.166 --> 17:14.625
Everybody loves you because
you're so charming and fun,

17:15.375 --> 17:17.458
as long as they don't
expect anything from you.

17:17.875 --> 17:19.916
The moment that they do,
you'll just leave.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.375
Just like Dad did.

17:23.833 --> 17:24.958
I'm not him.

17:27.541 --> 17:29.000
Kit, I'm not going anywhere.

17:41.250 --> 17:43.166
-Nope, can't do this.
-Dove! Hey.

17:43.791 --> 17:45.458
Dove. I just wanted to, um...

17:45.541 --> 17:46.625
-Wanted to find you.

17:46.708 --> 17:48.416
Don't speak. Shh.

17:49.541 --> 17:51.875
I think it's best
that we stop seeing each other.

17:52.708 --> 17:55.208
-Wait, I actually...
-Seeing you with those...

17:55.291 --> 17:59.208
Just, uh, made me crazy. Made me mad.

17:59.291 --> 18:02.375
And I was so distracted, I...

18:04.041 --> 18:06.458
I...

18:06.541 --> 18:07.958
I burned my muffins.

18:08.833 --> 18:10.458
-No!
-Yes!

18:10.541 --> 18:12.375
I never burn anything, ever.

18:13.041 --> 18:15.833
And I suddenly realized,
how can I expect you, the Prince,

18:15.916 --> 18:19.625
to commit to me, muffin girl,
when you've got countesses and trollops

18:19.708 --> 18:22.375
-shamelessly throwing themselves at you.
-Okay, uh, wait.

18:23.416 --> 18:24.416
What if, uh...

18:25.875 --> 18:26.916
I did?

18:28.833 --> 18:29.833
Huh?

18:29.916 --> 18:34.166
What if I did?
What if I was ready to commit?

18:34.916 --> 18:37.250
-Uh-huh?
-It's not the greatest marriage proposal,

18:37.333 --> 18:39.083
in fact, it might be the worst.

18:39.166 --> 18:41.583
But what if it was...
What if it was better?

18:43.916 --> 18:46.500
That's definitely something
that we can discuss.

19:04.708 --> 19:07.125
-Hey, hey, hey, stop. Stop.

19:07.208 --> 19:08.625
You scared the blummins out of me!

19:08.708 --> 19:11.541
I'm leaving. I came to say goodbye.

19:13.416 --> 19:15.375
Kit, I know you're upset...

19:15.458 --> 19:17.250
I'm not. I'm not.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.875
I'm thinking clearly
for the first time in my entire life.

19:20.583 --> 19:22.333
If you were,
you would know running isn't...

19:22.416 --> 19:24.125
This isn't about marrying Graydon.

19:25.375 --> 19:26.541
I mean, it is but,

19:28.916 --> 19:30.083
I'm looking for something.

19:32.416 --> 19:33.416
And it's not here.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.500
It's out there.

19:38.416 --> 19:40.416
Beyond the Barrier.

19:53.666 --> 19:56.500
You're gonna be a great knight.

20:03.958 --> 20:05.833
But I'll still kick your ass.

20:15.875 --> 20:18.208
It's a symbol
of my commitment to you.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.541
Just until I can get something more real.

20:21.208 --> 20:22.541
I don't have anything for you.

20:23.250 --> 20:24.291
Well, that's okay.

20:24.375 --> 20:27.625
You could just look at me, just like that,

20:29.000 --> 20:30.208
for the rest of my life.

20:31.500 --> 20:32.500
I could.

20:34.250 --> 20:35.250
I will.

20:44.708 --> 20:47.708
<i>This child will have</i>
<i>no power over me. Start the ritual.</i>

20:47.958 --> 20:49.208
ELORA'S MOTHER: <i>No! No!</i>

20:49.291 --> 20:50.291
<i>Sorsha!</i>

20:50.375 --> 20:52.041
ELORA'S MOTHER: <i>They're going to kill her!</i>

20:52.125 --> 20:53.250
<i>It's begun.</i>

20:54.416 --> 20:57.583
<i>The Gales, they're coming.</i>

20:58.750 --> 21:00.458
-<i>You know what to do.</i>

21:00.541 --> 21:01.708
Willow.

21:33.875 --> 21:34.875
Oh, God!

21:34.958 --> 21:36.791
You think you're gonna
talk me out of this...

21:36.875 --> 21:39.791
I know you well enough to know
there's no talking you out of anything.

21:39.875 --> 21:41.375
I'm just asking you to wait longer.

21:41.458 --> 21:42.458
For what?

21:43.416 --> 21:44.583
You wanna come?

21:44.666 --> 21:46.625
Kit, you know what I want.

21:48.333 --> 21:50.625
I wanna serve the Queen
and defend Tir Asleen.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.791
If you're my friend,
you won't ask me to choose you over them.

21:53.875 --> 21:55.416
If I don't go now, I never will.

21:58.041 --> 22:00.000
-Okay. Fine. Just do what you want.
-Ugh!

22:00.458 --> 22:02.833
You know, there's nothing brave
about running away...

22:08.791 --> 22:09.791
Is that fog?

22:19.666 --> 22:21.041
What's goin' on?

22:30.458 --> 22:31.541
Oh!

22:37.000 --> 22:38.083
Death Dogs.

23:05.458 --> 23:06.500
Please be careful.

23:07.666 --> 23:09.875
I'm always... relatively careful.

23:11.833 --> 23:13.083
Let our love be your strength.

23:14.666 --> 23:17.000
Right. Definitely gonna do that.

23:35.333 --> 23:37.125
-Jade!

23:39.083 --> 23:40.958
Inside, Your Highness!

24:06.833 --> 24:07.833
We're under siege.

24:08.375 --> 24:10.958
-Bone Reavers?
-Something else. Something worse.

24:11.041 --> 24:12.708
Fellas, fetch my Cleaver.

24:18.833 --> 24:19.833
Where's the Queen?

24:40.166 --> 24:42.791
Would it be too much to ask
you not to do anything stupid?

24:42.875 --> 24:43.958
Probably.

24:44.041 --> 24:45.041
Stay behind me.

25:07.125 --> 25:08.916
-Come on!

25:52.208 --> 25:54.125
-Ah!
-No!

25:55.708 --> 25:56.708
Mom!

26:28.291 --> 26:30.791
Oh, man. I'm sorry.
I thought you were gonna let go of her.

26:49.458 --> 26:51.500
Help! Somebody help her!

26:53.833 --> 26:55.166
Help.

26:55.250 --> 26:57.708
-Airk? Airk?

26:59.000 --> 27:01.083
Where are you?

27:03.125 --> 27:04.458
He was just behind me.

27:05.583 --> 27:06.833
Fighting that witch.

27:11.333 --> 27:12.666
They took him.

27:13.833 --> 27:14.833
I think...

27:16.833 --> 27:18.041
he's what they came for.

27:25.166 --> 27:29.541
I was up in the tower,
and I didn't know what to do or how to...

27:34.083 --> 27:39.500
And then I heard that
voice speaking in Pnakotic, I think.

27:40.541 --> 27:45.083
I saw a creature with huge gossamer wings
rise out of the mist,

27:45.166 --> 27:48.458
with someone in its talons,
thrashing around as it flew away,

27:48.541 --> 27:51.041
like a hawk who'd caught a mouse.

27:51.125 --> 27:53.333
Oi.
This is none of your concern.

27:53.416 --> 27:54.708
None of my...

27:55.166 --> 27:57.708
-It's my only concern.
-Which direction did it go?

27:57.791 --> 27:59.541
They're saying Airk was kidnapped.

28:00.750 --> 28:02.666
We have to find him.
We have to rescue him.

28:02.750 --> 28:05.041
Look, I appreciate
your affection for the prince,

28:05.125 --> 28:06.708
but these are serious matters.

28:06.791 --> 28:09.958
And I assure you,
everything that can be done, will be.

28:15.500 --> 28:18.125
Caught up with him on the edge of town,
trying to steal a horse.

28:18.208 --> 28:19.666
False. Patently false.

28:19.750 --> 28:22.666
I was actually checking on the conditions
of the stables

28:22.750 --> 28:24.958
as I was concerned
for the welfare of the animals.

28:25.041 --> 28:27.208
Is it a crime to care, huh?
To feel?

28:27.291 --> 28:28.708
-Enough!
-I'll go.

28:34.625 --> 28:35.625
I'll go.

28:38.500 --> 28:39.666
Yes.

28:42.750 --> 28:46.416
Mother, I said, I think I should
go west to search for Airk.

28:46.500 --> 28:47.541
I heard you.

28:49.041 --> 28:50.041
And I agree.

28:50.625 --> 28:52.916
Oh. Okay.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.583
My queen, if that is your decision,
I volunteer to go with her.

28:56.666 --> 28:59.250
You are the commander of the Pacalcade.

28:59.333 --> 29:02.625
You can't relinquish that responsibility
to go questing.

29:04.583 --> 29:05.583
I'll go.

29:05.666 --> 29:07.583
I've known Airk since the day he was born,

29:07.666 --> 29:10.041
and he's as close to a son
as I'll ever have...

29:10.125 --> 29:11.666
At least, that I'm aware of.

29:11.750 --> 29:12.833
Thank you.

29:13.666 --> 29:15.958
You're just the leader
this expedition needs.

29:17.541 --> 29:19.791
Me too. Where the princess goes, I go.

29:20.416 --> 29:21.833
In that case, so is Graydon.

29:21.916 --> 29:23.708
-I'm what now?
-You know, I think we're good,

29:23.791 --> 29:24.791
fellowship-wise.

29:24.875 --> 29:27.166
You'd let your bride-to-be
travel beyond the Barrier without you?

29:27.250 --> 29:30.083
It's not ideal
but I'd learn to live with it.

29:41.708 --> 29:42.708
Thraxus Boorman.

29:42.791 --> 29:43.791
Get off.

29:46.125 --> 29:48.208
-You've been beyond the Barrier.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.333
Aye, and it's no place for children.

29:51.416 --> 29:54.875
Be their guide,
and I'll pardon all your crimes.

29:55.958 --> 29:58.583
Really? Even the one
in the haberdashery with...

29:58.666 --> 30:00.208
I like the feel of velvet on my...

30:00.291 --> 30:01.458
Even that.

30:01.541 --> 30:03.500
-Okay.
-Madness! As good as setting him free!

30:03.583 --> 30:04.750
He'll see it done.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Not for a pardon,

30:08.791 --> 30:09.791
and not for me,

30:11.208 --> 30:13.208
but to square a debt with an old friend.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.166
Where would we even look?
You can't track something that flies.

30:22.250 --> 30:25.750
Which is why you're going
to need a sorcerer.

30:26.416 --> 30:27.416
A sorcerer?

30:28.083 --> 30:30.875
Terrific. Okay.
All the sorcerers are gone.

30:30.958 --> 30:32.291
There's one.

30:33.375 --> 30:34.416
A Nelwyn.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.125
Lives in a village on the River Freen.

30:38.583 --> 30:41.083
And I have a feeling, he's expecting you.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.750
<i>It's all happening</i>
<i>just as he said it would.</i>

30:47.625 --> 30:52.791
I believed if Elora Danan disappeared
and we forbade magic,

30:52.875 --> 30:55.833
that perhaps we could keep evil out.

30:56.750 --> 30:58.708
Willow disagreed.

30:58.791 --> 31:03.166
He believed eventually evil
would find its way in,

31:03.250 --> 31:06.750
and when it did, magic would be
the only thing that could save us.

31:12.375 --> 31:13.416
But there's more.

31:14.958 --> 31:17.458
It won't be easy to hear this,
but you must.

31:18.958 --> 31:23.458
Bavmorda's blood, her spirit, survived.

31:23.541 --> 31:26.125
In me, in your brother, and in you.

31:26.208 --> 31:29.000
Willow had a vision
that one day that spirit would return

31:29.083 --> 31:30.458
and destroy Tir Asleen.

31:30.916 --> 31:32.875
Last night, I saw it too.

31:34.666 --> 31:39.083
The last thing that Airk said to me
was that he would never leave me.

31:41.458 --> 31:42.625
And when he said it, I...

31:43.208 --> 31:44.208
I didn't care.

31:46.458 --> 31:48.000
Mom, I'm so sorry.

31:48.083 --> 31:49.333
I'm sorry too.

31:52.750 --> 31:56.125
Look, just be careful.

31:59.625 --> 32:02.375
<i>We have enemies without and within.</i>

32:05.375 --> 32:06.375
<i>I had this made</i>

32:08.000 --> 32:10.041
as a gift for when
you left for Galladoorn.

32:10.625 --> 32:13.416
A knight is defined
not by skill in battle,

32:13.500 --> 32:15.083
but by the oaths they keep.

32:15.625 --> 32:16.958
I hope that when we next meet,

32:17.041 --> 32:19.458
you feel like I've earned this
beautiful gift.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.500
The fate of Tir Asleen may well rest
on whether you succeed or fail.

32:23.583 --> 32:25.333
I won't fail.

32:26.375 --> 32:29.208
Kit's like her father,
she'll never stop looking for Airk.

32:29.291 --> 32:30.875
I won't let anything happen to her.

32:30.958 --> 32:33.083
She'll need you to be sensible
when she's rash.

32:33.166 --> 32:35.500
I'm counting on you as I would any knight.

33:36.500 --> 33:37.875
How much further to the Barrier?

33:38.666 --> 33:39.875
Another day. Maybe less.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.500
Rangers garrisoned
at the Mothers' Gate

33:42.583 --> 33:44.708
are led by Commander Remar, an old friend.

33:44.791 --> 33:46.958
We can resupply
before we head beyond the realm.

33:47.041 --> 33:49.083
-You ever seen the Mothers' Gate?
-Aye.

33:50.041 --> 33:51.041
Ever been beyond it?

33:52.625 --> 33:55.000
Don't worry. There's plenty of stuff
I've done that you haven't.

33:55.083 --> 33:56.625
I think someone's followin' us.

33:56.708 --> 33:58.333
You know, that's what I thought.

33:58.416 --> 34:00.666
Then I realized,
you'd have to be daft to follow us,

34:00.750 --> 34:02.125
considering we're all gonna die.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.583
Wait, you think we're gonna die?

34:03.666 --> 34:06.416
I wish someone told me.
I'm really scared of dying.

34:07.083 --> 34:08.833
-That and communal bathing...

34:11.083 --> 34:12.250
Let's get off the road.

34:16.083 --> 34:18.125
Hey, they're coming. Get down.

34:24.750 --> 34:26.416
Hey! Put me down!

34:27.250 --> 34:29.291
-Uh-uh.

34:30.166 --> 34:32.250
-Absolutely not.
-I wanna help rescue the Prince.

34:32.333 --> 34:33.500
Tough. Go home.

34:33.583 --> 34:35.250
You don't understand. We're in love.

34:35.333 --> 34:38.208
Don't know how to break it to you,
but Airk's been in love with...

34:38.291 --> 34:40.375
Not like this, not like us.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.333
-You think I'm a fool, fine, I don't care.
-Hmm.

34:44.625 --> 34:47.333
What we have comes around once,
maybe, if you're lucky.

34:48.541 --> 34:50.583
There is nothing
we wouldn't do for each other.

34:50.666 --> 34:52.166
Have you ever been in a fight?

34:53.083 --> 34:55.083
-You mean, like, verbally?

34:55.166 --> 34:58.333
I mean, like, defending yourself
against someone who wants to hurt you.

34:58.416 --> 34:59.458
No.

35:00.625 --> 35:01.625
Have you?

35:04.250 --> 35:06.750
I can do other stuff, whatever you need.
Tend horses.

35:06.833 --> 35:08.208
Somebody's gotta cook, right?

35:10.666 --> 35:12.708
-Are you any good?
-I'm phenomenal.

35:12.791 --> 35:14.083
She's not coming with us.

35:14.166 --> 35:15.208
You heard the Princess.

35:15.291 --> 35:17.250
You're going back
to Tir Asleen at first light.

35:18.416 --> 35:19.750
What?

35:19.833 --> 35:23.750
What? It'll be dark soon.
She can go back in the morning.

35:25.291 --> 35:26.666
So what can you cook out here?

35:38.625 --> 35:40.583
Seriously? You brought a flute?

35:41.083 --> 35:42.625
Yeah, was that not a good idea?

35:42.708 --> 35:45.458
My nan believed that music
was a balm for the soul. So...

35:45.541 --> 35:49.041
This is not some jaunt
or your chance to see the world.

35:49.125 --> 35:50.125
It's dangerous.

35:50.208 --> 35:53.333
And those things that took Airk,
they're not just gonna give him back.

35:55.833 --> 35:56.958
Hey, tell him.

36:01.208 --> 36:04.541
Well, you're all so naive, it's adorable.

36:06.208 --> 36:10.125
What? You've never known
pain, fear, hunger.

36:10.833 --> 36:13.000
Out there,
it won't matter who your parents are,

36:13.750 --> 36:15.250
or what you think you deserve.

36:17.250 --> 36:19.500
The world is bigger
than you could possibly imagine...

36:22.208 --> 36:24.083
It doesn't give a damn about any of you.

36:24.166 --> 36:25.583
Possum stew?

36:33.958 --> 36:36.958
-Wow.
-Phenomenal.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.416
I know this is a silly question,
but what is the Barrier, actually?

36:47.125 --> 36:51.166
It's a force field, forged by Raziel
and Cherlindrea to protect the realm.

36:52.083 --> 36:55.333
It was a refuge for those who wanted
a life that was more than just survival.

37:02.041 --> 37:05.125
My, um, family was headed

37:05.208 --> 37:07.916
to the Mothers' Gate
when we were attacked.

37:10.583 --> 37:11.833
I was the only one who survived.

37:13.041 --> 37:15.750
That's... depressing,

37:15.833 --> 37:17.541
but not why they built the Barrier.

37:17.625 --> 37:18.750
He's right.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.833
It wasn't built to protect the realm,
it was built for Elora Danan.

37:25.791 --> 37:27.083
What happened to her?

37:27.166 --> 37:28.583
People say she's dead.

37:28.666 --> 37:31.166
But the prophecy says
that one day she'll return

37:31.250 --> 37:34.166
and unite the world against
forces of darkness.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.291
Truth is, no one actually knows.

37:36.375 --> 37:37.541
My mother knows.

37:38.208 --> 37:39.833
Pretty sure my father knew too.

37:40.541 --> 37:43.458
I think he snuck her out of the castle
one night and took her somewhere

37:43.541 --> 37:46.208
far away where nobody would find her.
And then,

37:46.291 --> 37:48.041
stayed with her.

37:48.125 --> 37:50.750
That what you really think
or what you wanna believe?

37:52.333 --> 37:55.583
Why would I want to believe
that he chose her instead of us?

37:57.750 --> 37:58.750
I don't know.

37:59.333 --> 38:02.083
Maybe 'cause, you know,
sometimes it's easier to hate them.

38:34.416 --> 38:35.458
The kitchen maid?

38:36.875 --> 38:38.791
She's gone. When I woke up.

38:39.166 --> 38:41.166
Yeah, one night of sleeping
on the hard ground

38:41.250 --> 38:43.291
will cure anyone
of their romantic fantasies.

38:43.875 --> 38:45.166
Maybe she kept goin'?

38:45.250 --> 38:48.458
Nah, unless she found the gate.
She won't get across that gorge.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.458
Shit.

39:42.416 --> 39:43.416
Where is everyone?

39:45.666 --> 39:47.041
Armory's untouched.

39:47.125 --> 39:48.583
If they fled, they went in a hurry.

39:48.666 --> 39:51.208
-Guys.
-They'd never abandon their post.

39:51.291 --> 39:52.750
Guys.

39:52.833 --> 39:54.041
Look at this.

39:56.416 --> 39:58.375
"We stand at the threshold.

40:02.041 --> 40:03.375
"We peer into the void.

40:03.958 --> 40:05.708
"We bear witness to his glory.

40:06.250 --> 40:09.458
"The Eternal One, the healer of worlds."

40:20.958 --> 40:26.000
"As he stirs from his deathless slumber
deep below the surface,

40:27.041 --> 40:30.083
"the Harbinger of the Wyrm will come."

41:32.416 --> 41:33.833
-Whoa.

41:33.916 --> 41:35.625
-Wow...

42:10.666 --> 42:11.708
Unbelievable.

42:11.791 --> 42:13.083
Gotta admire her persistence.

42:13.166 --> 42:14.791
No, she's gonna get herself killed.

42:14.875 --> 42:17.708
-Hey!

42:22.416 --> 42:23.875
-Oh...
-What did I say?

42:23.958 --> 42:27.083
You're not the boss of me, Princess.
Not out here.

42:27.166 --> 42:28.666
I like her. We should keep her.

42:28.750 --> 42:30.000
-Nobody asked!
-Shut up.

42:30.083 --> 42:32.416
Enough. We don't have
time for your bickering.

42:33.041 --> 42:34.750
Airk doesn't have time.

42:34.833 --> 42:37.250
I don't care if you like each other.

42:38.166 --> 42:39.541
We're all in this together now.

42:40.125 --> 42:43.083
And out here, in the world beyond,

42:44.666 --> 42:49.500
if you're not vigilant at each moment,
I swear you will not survive...

42:58.125 --> 42:59.333
Bone Reavers!

43:01.708 --> 43:03.833
-Ride! Hyah!
-Hyah!

43:03.916 --> 43:05.375
Oh.

43:06.583 --> 43:08.166
Really? Thank you.

43:12.458 --> 43:14.625
Yeah, this is exactly
why you can't come with us.

43:23.375 --> 43:24.375
Get 'em!

43:31.958 --> 43:34.958
Why are you riding so slow?
We are being chased!

43:37.166 --> 43:39.041
Oh, no!

43:40.791 --> 43:41.833
Oh, God!

43:44.125 --> 43:45.458
Come on!

43:48.291 --> 43:49.333
You okay?

43:52.166 --> 43:53.416
Okay.

43:55.166 --> 43:57.500
Boorman,
you're supposed to be dead.

43:57.583 --> 43:58.666
That's not me, mate.

43:58.750 --> 44:00.208
You're thinkin' of someone else.

44:05.291 --> 44:07.791
<i>Hsu-gala! Hsu-gala!</i>

44:07.875 --> 44:09.750
-Boorman!
-Boorman! What are you doing?

44:09.833 --> 44:11.708
<i>-Hsu-gala!</i>
<i>-Hsu-gala?</i>

44:11.791 --> 44:15.583
<i>Hsu-gala!</i>

44:15.666 --> 44:17.500
-What?

44:25.958 --> 44:27.333
Boorman!

44:37.541 --> 44:38.583
That was incredible.

44:39.666 --> 44:40.666
How did you get him to...

44:41.916 --> 44:43.916
I've never seen horses do that.
What is <i>Hsu-Gala?</i>

44:45.416 --> 44:46.791
It's an ancient Angorian word.

44:48.166 --> 44:49.166
It means, "Stop."

45:05.750 --> 45:08.041
I wanted to say, uh, I'm sorry...

45:09.583 --> 45:11.166
About the way I behaved.

45:13.750 --> 45:14.750
It was...

45:15.916 --> 45:18.583
I was very childish. And...

45:19.041 --> 45:20.125
No, it's okay.

45:20.250 --> 45:23.583
I, I can understand not wantin' to
marry someone that you barely know.

45:24.416 --> 45:26.000
I wasn't happy about it either.

45:26.750 --> 45:27.750
You weren't?

45:28.708 --> 45:30.083
I mean, you're...

45:30.166 --> 45:32.833
You're a very pretty person,

45:32.916 --> 45:34.458
-but, uh...

45:34.541 --> 45:37.125
I just think you should be
in love with someone

45:37.208 --> 45:41.333
before you commit to spending
the rest of your life with them, right?

45:43.375 --> 45:47.041
And what about our responsibility
to unite the realm?

45:47.791 --> 45:49.916
One day you and I are gonna be in charge.

45:51.833 --> 45:52.916
And when that day comes,

45:53.000 --> 45:55.500
we don't have to do things
the way our parents did.

46:16.208 --> 46:18.833
Are you sure this is the same village
my mother was talking about?

46:18.916 --> 46:21.500
-It's the only village in the valley.
-Where is everybody?

46:21.583 --> 46:23.083
Oh, Daikinis.

46:23.791 --> 46:26.208
Terrific. Just what I need.

46:26.291 --> 46:27.291
What happened here?

46:27.375 --> 46:30.333
Plenty. And if you're not careful,
it will happen to you too.

46:30.416 --> 46:32.333
We're looking for the sorcerer Willow.

46:32.750 --> 46:35.000
Congratulations. You found him.

46:36.166 --> 46:37.166
You're Willow?

46:37.250 --> 46:39.916
Yep, that's me. Willow.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.208
But I'm out of the sorcery business now.

46:42.291 --> 46:45.125
I've retired. So jog on.

46:45.208 --> 46:47.000
My name is Kit Tanthalos.

46:47.833 --> 46:48.875
My mother is Sorsha.

46:49.458 --> 46:51.166
She sent me here to come find you.

46:51.833 --> 46:53.291
She told me that once long ago,

46:53.375 --> 46:56.416
you stood together against
the forces of evil and defeated them.

46:57.625 --> 47:00.916
The world needs you again.
It needs your magic.

47:02.208 --> 47:05.791
It's okay.
She is who she claims to be.

47:06.583 --> 47:07.583
How do you know?

47:08.041 --> 47:09.333
I read her mind.

47:14.625 --> 47:15.666
Kidding.

47:15.750 --> 47:18.333
Had you though, didn't I?
I didn't read your mind.

47:19.083 --> 47:21.875
It's just, you remind me of your mother.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.666
-My brother, Airk, was taken by...
-The Gales.

47:26.750 --> 47:28.458
-The what?
-Your brother's alive.

47:28.541 --> 47:30.458
A prisoner of The Withered Crone,

47:30.541 --> 47:33.958
who dwells in the Immemorial City
that lies beyond the Shattered Sea.

47:34.791 --> 47:37.166
The four who came to Tir Asleen
are her servants.

47:37.250 --> 47:39.583
I'm sorry, did you say,
"beyond the Shattered Sea"?

47:40.958 --> 47:42.666
-Okay.
-What?

47:42.750 --> 47:44.666
Princess, I've traveled
all across the world,

47:44.750 --> 47:46.083
met some real magical marvins,

47:46.166 --> 47:48.083
but I never met anyone
who crossed the Shattered Sea.

47:48.166 --> 47:49.833
That's where all the maps end.

47:49.916 --> 47:53.125
And that's where we must go.
Beyond the edge of our world,

47:53.208 --> 47:56.958
into the unknown. It's the only way to...

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
to...

48:13.458 --> 48:14.458
What...

48:15.708 --> 48:16.708
What are you...

48:29.791 --> 48:31.083
You shouldn't be here,

48:32.833 --> 48:34.458
but it's so good to see you, Elora.

48:36.166 --> 48:37.208
Did he just say...

48:37.291 --> 48:38.625
No, you've made a mistake.

48:38.708 --> 48:43.791
That's not... I'm not... I'm nobody.

48:43.875 --> 48:45.541
You are Elora Danan,

48:45.625 --> 48:49.083
Last Blood of Kymeria, future Empress,

48:49.166 --> 48:53.291
High Priestess,
Semprum Sorceress of the Nine Realms,

48:53.375 --> 48:58.666
and the world's last, best hope
against the evil coming to destroy us all.

49:02.875 --> 49:03.875
What?
