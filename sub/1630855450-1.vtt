00:43.314 --> 00:44.524
<i>Mission Report.</i>

00:44.524 --> 00:49.529
<i>Russian Federation submarine
K599</i> Sevastopol<i>.</i>

00:50.113 --> 00:51.948
<i>Operation: Podkova.</i>

00:51.948 --> 00:53.741
<i>Day 74.</i>

00:55.869 --> 00:58.621
<i>The active learning defense system
we are testing...</i>

00:59.414 --> 01:01.457
<i>...continues to operate flawlessly.</i>

01:02.000 --> 01:03.501
<i>One might even say...</i>

01:03.501 --> 01:04.918
<i>...miraculously.</i>

01:04.918 --> 01:09.424
<i>We are navigating under the Arctic ice cap
by dead reckoning</i>

01:09.424 --> 01:11.009
<i>and five days from home.</i>

01:11.593 --> 01:14.137
<i>After 25,000 nautical miles,</i>

01:14.137 --> 01:18.850
<i>the</i> Sevastopol <i>has deliberately approached
every navy in the world</i>

01:18.850 --> 01:21.853
<i>and remained completely undetected.</i>

01:23.688 --> 01:28.693
<i>The Podkova's stealth capability
has exceeded all expectations.</i>

01:34.365 --> 01:38.912
<i>We are at this moment the state of the art</i>

01:38.912 --> 01:40.330
<i>of war.</i>

01:44.417 --> 01:46.753
<i>The most fearsome killing machine</i>

01:46.753 --> 01:49.047
<i>ever devised by man.</i>

01:51.090 --> 01:54.802
<i>And we are impossible to find.</i>

01:57.722 --> 02:00.767
Captain, we have a submerged contact,
designated Semyon-83,

02:00.767 --> 02:03.561
exhibiting tonals
of a US Virginia-class submarine.

02:03.561 --> 02:06.022
Bearing 130°, drawing forward.

02:07.190 --> 02:09.191
Chief of the Watch,
man battle stations silently.

02:09.734 --> 02:11.653
Officer of the Deck, ship status?

02:11.653 --> 02:14.197
Ship's depth, 50 meters.
Bottom, 72 meters.

02:14.197 --> 02:16.491
Clearance to the ice canopy, 21 meters.

02:16.491 --> 02:18.576
- Distance to deep water?
- Two kilometers.

02:18.576 --> 02:20.370
Aleutian Precipice in six minutes.

02:20.370 --> 02:22.830
Ranging maneuver.
Helm, left 15 degrees rudder.

02:22.830 --> 02:24.624
Steady course 100°.

02:24.624 --> 02:26.251
Come up easy on a standard bell.

02:26.251 --> 02:28.086
- Captain has the conn.
- Helm, aye!

02:28.086 --> 02:30.255
Coming to course 100°.

02:43.935 --> 02:45.770
Steady on course 100°.

02:45.770 --> 02:47.230
Weapons Officer, range?

02:47.230 --> 02:51.317
Firing solution is tracking at a distance
of 15,000 meters.

02:51.317 --> 02:54.487
Sir, that doesn't make sense.
Tonals this loud and clear?

02:54.487 --> 02:56.489
<i>He must be closer than that.</i>

02:57.740 --> 03:01.744
Captain, firing solution just did
a step change to 10,000 meters.

03:02.453 --> 03:03.788
Nothing moves that fast.

03:03.788 --> 03:06.291
All solutions are matching.
The range is true.

03:06.291 --> 03:08.543
Helm, right full rudder to course 270°.

03:08.543 --> 03:10.461
Course 270°, aye.

03:14.090 --> 03:16.217
We'll just walk away
and head for deep water.

03:16.217 --> 03:18.928
Contact bearing 160°.

03:18.928 --> 03:20.805
Bearing rate zero?

03:20.805 --> 03:23.224
He's there, turning with us again.

03:24.434 --> 03:26.185
He can see us.

03:26.185 --> 03:28.187
Impossible. We're invisible.

03:28.187 --> 03:32.442
Weapons, run diagnostics on sonar
and fire control. Something isn't right.

03:32.442 --> 03:34.485
Sir, he's flooding his torpedo tubes!

03:35.153 --> 03:37.197
Torpedo room, conn.
Load all torpedo tubes.

03:37.197 --> 03:38.114
Aye, sir.

03:41.201 --> 03:43.578
- Check clear!
- Forward clear!

03:43.578 --> 03:46.164
- Aft clear! Ram torpedo!
- Ramming!

03:48.041 --> 03:49.459
Torpedo tubes loaded.

03:49.459 --> 03:50.877
He's opened outer doors!

03:50.877 --> 03:53.129
Weapons, flood tubes one through four
and open outer doors.

03:53.129 --> 03:55.089
Enter firing solution into tube two.

03:55.089 --> 03:57.884
Aye, Captain.
Making tube two ready in all respects.

03:57.884 --> 03:59.260
Captain, he's provoking us.

03:59.260 --> 04:01.763
He wants an excuse
to blow us out of the water.

04:01.763 --> 04:05.266
Enemy torpedo in the water, bearing 200°.
1,000 meters and accelerating.

04:05.266 --> 04:07.769
Helm, left full rudder,
all ahead flank cavitate.

04:07.769 --> 04:10.355
My rudder is left full.
Answering all ahead flank cavitate.

04:10.355 --> 04:12.482
- Launch countermeasures.
- Launching countermeasures.

04:15.985 --> 04:18.196
- Fire tube two.
- Firing tube two.

04:21.533 --> 04:23.117
Our torpedo is away. Running hot.

04:26.204 --> 04:28.998
Enemy torpedo still homing,
range 800 meters.

04:28.998 --> 04:30.291
He's blown through our countermeasures.

04:30.291 --> 04:32.669
- Helm, right full rudder.
- Right full. Aye, sir!

04:32.669 --> 04:33.670
600 meters.

04:33.670 --> 04:36.214
Diving Officer, stand by to emergency blow
all main ballast tanks.

04:36.214 --> 04:37.173
400 meters.

04:37.173 --> 04:38.341
Chief of the Watch,
stand by the collision alarm.

04:38.341 --> 04:39.717
200 meters.

04:39.717 --> 04:41.427
This is the captain.
All hands brace for impact.

04:41.427 --> 04:43.263
Enemy torpedo impact in...

04:43.263 --> 04:45.515
five... four...

04:46.349 --> 04:48.601
three... two...

04:49.435 --> 04:50.270
one.

04:50.937 --> 04:51.771
Impact!

05:02.866 --> 05:05.243
- What just happened?
- It's gone.

05:05.243 --> 05:07.579
- It missed us?
- No.

05:07.579 --> 05:11.040
It vanished like it was never there.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.585
Sonar, where is the enemy vessel?

05:13.585 --> 05:16.880
Bearing 330°,
4,000 meters off our starboard bow.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.214
Our torpedo is running true.

05:18.214 --> 05:20.592
Impact with enemy submarine in...

05:21.134 --> 05:24.220
three... two... one.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.893
Where was the impact?

05:29.893 --> 05:32.645
Captain, enemy submarine has vanished.

05:32.645 --> 05:34.439
It's gone, sir.

05:34.439 --> 05:36.107
I don't understand.

05:41.571 --> 05:42.697
He was never there.

05:45.825 --> 05:47.368
We've been chasing a phantom.

05:47.368 --> 05:50.205
It was right there.
The instruments don't lie.

05:50.205 --> 05:52.582
They lied to us today.

05:52.582 --> 05:55.418
- Weapons, shut down our torpedo.
- Aye, Captain.

05:55.418 --> 05:57.212
Shutting down torpedo.

05:57.212 --> 05:59.923
Secure from battle stations.

06:02.550 --> 06:04.469
This is why we have sea trials.

06:05.470 --> 06:07.055
There's a bug in the system.

06:08.932 --> 06:10.516
A ghost in the machine.

06:13.269 --> 06:14.979
- It's time to go home.
- Captain!

06:14.979 --> 06:18.107
Our own torpedo is not responding.
It's coming right at us!

06:18.107 --> 06:21.236
- Our torpedo's homing, range 400 meters!
- Oh, my God.

06:21.236 --> 06:23.196
Wire command. Shut down our weapon!

06:24.614 --> 06:28.034
Our torpedo's still closing,
range 200 meters!

06:28.034 --> 06:31.037
Blow all main ballast tanks!
Sound the collision alar--

07:30.638 --> 07:32.223
Food delivery.

07:41.900 --> 07:43.151
Hello?

07:51.618 --> 07:52.619
Designator.

07:52.619 --> 07:54.162
Easy.

07:55.455 --> 07:56.706
Easy.

07:59.083 --> 08:00.335
Designator.

08:03.171 --> 08:05.006
India-Zulu-254.

08:06.090 --> 08:07.926
Bravo-Echo-11.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.054
No, not yet.

08:11.054 --> 08:13.640
You need to ask me
the security question first.

08:13.640 --> 08:16.017
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

08:18.269 --> 08:19.562
What is the oath?

08:24.484 --> 08:26.819
We live and die in the shadows

08:28.363 --> 08:30.031
for those we hold close

08:31.491 --> 08:33.493
and for those we never meet.

08:37.329 --> 08:38.623
You can put it on the table.

08:54.222 --> 08:55.390
Hey.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.853
Welcome to the IMF.

09:02.522 --> 09:04.232
You made the right choice.

09:07.861 --> 09:08.987
Sir.

09:14.492 --> 09:16.452
<i>Good evening, Mr. Hunt.</i>

09:17.620 --> 09:19.455
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

09:20.540 --> 09:22.959
<i>Our lives are the sum of our choices</i>

09:24.419 --> 09:26.796
<i>and we cannot escape the past.</i>

09:27.630 --> 09:30.550
<i>Thirty years ago,
you were offered the choice.</i>

09:30.550 --> 09:34.429
<i>Join the IMF or spend your life in prison.</i>

09:35.513 --> 09:39.976
<i>Because of your unique natural talents,
your government forgave you.</i>

09:39.976 --> 09:42.395
<i>But we will never forget.</i>

09:42.395 --> 09:45.023
<i>Just as you will never forget the death</i>

09:45.023 --> 09:48.109
<i>that brought you to us
all those years ago.</i>

10:02.749 --> 10:07.337
<i>This is to remind you of your oath
and allegiance to us.</i>

10:07.337 --> 10:10.423
<i>The stakes of this mission
are higher than ever.</i>

10:10.423 --> 10:13.843
<i>Your habitual rogue behavior
will not be tolerated.</i>

10:13.843 --> 10:18.389
<i>Should you choose to accept,
it is imperative that you listen.</i>

10:19.307 --> 10:22.060
<i>Your government is searching for a key.</i>

10:22.060 --> 10:25.396
<i>Its purpose, its vital importance to us,</i>

10:25.396 --> 10:27.982
<i>is none of your concern.</i>

10:27.982 --> 10:32.779
<i>What should concern you is
the involvement of your friend Ilsa Faust.</i>

10:34.364 --> 10:36.824
<i>She killed a courier in Istanbul.</i>

10:36.824 --> 10:41.621
<i>And we believe he was carrying one half
of the key we're searching for.</i>

10:42.163 --> 10:46.000
<i>Why she has chosen to interfere
in this affair is a mystery,</i>

10:46.000 --> 10:48.336
<i>as are her whereabouts.</i>

10:49.087 --> 10:53.716
<i>What is certain is that your government
has put a price on her head</i>

10:54.717 --> 10:58.555
<i>and these bounty hunters
are out to collect it.</i>

10:59.180 --> 11:02.100
<i>They never bring a fugitive back alive.</i>

11:02.100 --> 11:04.894
<i>And rarely in one piece.</i>

11:04.894 --> 11:07.772
<i>We believe they're headed for
the Arabian Desert's Empty Quarter</i>

11:07.772 --> 11:09.899
<i>in search of your friend.</i>

11:09.899 --> 11:13.695
<i>Find the bounty hunters,
and you may just find her.</i>

11:14.654 --> 11:17.657
<i>Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,</i>

11:17.657 --> 11:21.202
<i>is to acquire the key
and deliver it to us.</i>

11:21.202 --> 11:24.581
<i>What happens to Ilsa after that
is up to you.</i>

11:25.456 --> 11:29.502
<i>As always, if any members of your team
are caught or killed,</i>

11:29.502 --> 11:33.006
<i>the secretary will disavow
any knowledge of your actions.</i>

11:34.048 --> 11:37.719
<i>This message will self-destruct
in five seconds.</i>

11:38.469 --> 11:40.138
<i>Good luck, Ethan.</i>

12:14.005 --> 12:15.089
Come.

13:04.847 --> 13:06.224
Ethan.

15:48.386 --> 15:50.179
So what are we dealing with?

15:50.179 --> 15:56.352
This "entity" has multiple personalities,
at times behaving like a computer virus...

15:56.352 --> 15:58.563
...then a tapeworm, then a botnet.

15:58.563 --> 16:02.233
Distorting any and all digital information
with which it comes in contact.

16:02.233 --> 16:03.359
Once infected,

16:03.359 --> 16:07.447
nothing recorded, stored or transmitted
digitally can be trusted as fact.

16:07.447 --> 16:11.743
At the outset, it concentrated primarily
on news and social media,

16:11.743 --> 16:14.954
which was of little concern to us
as it often suited our purposes.

16:14.954 --> 16:16.164
Until six months ago,

16:16.164 --> 16:19.459
when the entity breached Saudi Arabia's
General Intelligence Directorate.

16:19.459 --> 16:22.879
And assimilated their top secret
active learning AI

16:22.879 --> 16:25.215
before vanishing into the cloud.

16:25.215 --> 16:28.509
Subsequent attacks increased
ten-thousandfold overnight,

16:28.509 --> 16:30.220
spreading exponentially.

16:30.220 --> 16:33.681
Indicating that the Entity
has since become

16:33.681 --> 16:35.225
sentient.

16:35.934 --> 16:37.936
You're telling me this thing
has a mind of its own?

16:37.936 --> 16:39.854
<i>Over the last three weeks alone,</i>

16:39.854 --> 16:43.608
<i>it has accessed our satellite
telecommunications, the Federal Reserve,</i>

16:43.608 --> 16:46.236
<i>the stock market
and the national power grid.</i>

16:46.236 --> 16:49.531
<i>The FAA, NASA and the combined
branches of our military.</i>

16:49.531 --> 16:54.285
<i>And we're not alone. It has penetrated
the World and European Central Banks.</i>

16:54.285 --> 16:57.580
<i>Gained entry to the major defense,
finance and infrastructure systems</i>

16:57.580 --> 17:02.126
<i>of Russia, India, Israel, Australasia,
all of Europe.</i>

17:02.126 --> 17:05.046
<i>And what did it do
to all of these systems exactly?</i>

17:05.046 --> 17:06.172
Nothing.

17:07.215 --> 17:08.132
Nothing?

17:08.132 --> 17:09.551
It came and it went,

17:09.551 --> 17:12.595
leaving fingerprints
where they could easily be found

17:12.595 --> 17:15.514
and sending a very clear message.

17:17.183 --> 17:18.810
"I shall return."

17:18.810 --> 17:22.647
Whatever its ultimate goal is,
we're powerless to stop it.

17:22.647 --> 17:26.609
The full force of its energy is now
directed at a single objective.

17:26.609 --> 17:28.528
The world's intelligence networks.

17:28.528 --> 17:30.947
The very truth as we know it.

17:30.947 --> 17:35.702
<i>The entire intelligence community
is racing to archive hard copies</i>

17:35.702 --> 17:37.871
<i>of our fact-positive knowledge bases</i>

17:37.871 --> 17:41.875
<i>before our most secure data centers
are breached and corrupted.</i>

17:41.875 --> 17:43.793
<i>Which is only a matter of time.</i>

17:43.793 --> 17:45.837
<i>The Entity will know precisely</i>

17:45.837 --> 17:49.716
<i>how to undermine our every strength
and exploit our every weakness.</i>

17:49.716 --> 17:52.427
How to turn our allies into enemies

17:52.427 --> 17:55.597
and our enemies into aggressors.

17:55.597 --> 17:58.349
Why not air-gap our intelligence servers?

17:58.349 --> 18:00.727
Cut them off
from the outside world entirely?

18:00.727 --> 18:02.145
We already have.

18:02.145 --> 18:05.481
But servers require humans
to maintain them.

18:05.481 --> 18:08.735
And humans are the weakest link
in any security chain,

18:08.735 --> 18:12.864
especially when dealing with
a godless, stateless, amoral enemy.

18:12.864 --> 18:16.784
One that has been patiently listening,
reading, watching.

18:16.784 --> 18:20.121
Harvesting our deepest personal secrets
for years.

18:20.121 --> 18:25.335
Able to beguile, blackmail, bribe
or be anyone it wants.

18:25.335 --> 18:29.047
And to manipulate us at will
through our total dependence

18:29.047 --> 18:32.050
on a carefully constructed
digital reality.

18:32.050 --> 18:34.385
An enemy that is everywhere

18:35.470 --> 18:37.263
and nowhere

18:37.263 --> 18:39.182
and has no center.

18:43.269 --> 18:46.439
All right, so what you're telling me is,

18:46.439 --> 18:51.194
the most awesome goddamn intelligence
and tactical apparatus on the planet

18:51.194 --> 18:54.697
has no way of killing this thing.

18:54.697 --> 18:56.866
You don't want to kill it, sir.

18:58.409 --> 18:59.953
You want to control it.

18:59.953 --> 19:03.122
And how do we do that, Mr. Kittridge?

19:03.998 --> 19:06.584
The CIA's assets in the Kremlin
informed us

19:06.584 --> 19:11.130
that the Russians have focused the
majority of their intelligence activity

19:11.130 --> 19:14.592
on acquiring two halves
of a cruciform key.

19:15.468 --> 19:18.179
- And what does it unlock?
- Not exactly sure.

19:18.888 --> 19:21.432
But the Russians seem to believe
that it somehow has

19:21.432 --> 19:24.394
the power to deactivate
our mysterious Entity.

19:24.394 --> 19:25.812
Though, ideally,

19:27.230 --> 19:30.149
they hope to control it, harness it.

19:30.149 --> 19:32.527
Do you believe that, Kittridge?

19:33.278 --> 19:37.407
What matters is that
the rest of the world believes it.

19:37.407 --> 19:40.285
Japan, India, Germany
and the Brits believe it.

19:40.285 --> 19:42.120
And yet no one,

19:42.120 --> 19:44.163
not even our closest allies,

19:44.163 --> 19:47.083
have willingly whispered
one word of it to us.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.752
Which would indicate
that there's a global race on

19:49.752 --> 19:52.714
to acquire the two halves of this key.

19:52.714 --> 19:57.802
Every nation in it for themselves,
not to kill this thing, sir,

19:58.595 --> 20:00.263
but to weaponize it.

20:00.263 --> 20:04.684
And, in so doing, establish
a new, incontestable form

20:04.684 --> 20:06.311
of global dominance.

20:06.311 --> 20:07.979
How do we find this key first?

20:07.979 --> 20:11.566
Well, we know that a buyer is passing
somewhere through the Middle East

20:11.566 --> 20:14.527
sometime in the next 72 hours.

20:14.527 --> 20:17.780
We believe that he already has
one half of this key.

20:17.780 --> 20:18.907
You believe.

20:18.907 --> 20:21.242
At this point, we can't be certain
it's not a counterfeit.

20:21.242 --> 20:22.744
How would you verify that?

20:22.744 --> 20:26.039
The only thing that can authenticate
one genuine half of the key is

20:26.664 --> 20:29.292
the other genuine half of the key--
its true mate, if you will.

20:29.292 --> 20:31.961
We think it's some sort of fail-safe.

20:31.961 --> 20:33.171
How do we find its mate?

20:33.171 --> 20:36.633
Well, we believe
the other genuine half of the key

20:36.633 --> 20:38.968
was in the hands of this woman.

20:38.968 --> 20:40.220
Who is she?

20:40.220 --> 20:41.721
<i>Ilsa Faust.</i>

20:41.721 --> 20:43.306
<i>Former British Intelligence.</i>

20:43.306 --> 20:46.059
- Where is she now?
- She's dead, sir.

20:46.059 --> 20:48.061
She was-- excuse me--

20:48.061 --> 20:51.648
<i>killed by mercenaries
looking to collect a bounty.</i>

20:51.648 --> 20:53.024
And who put up the bounty?

20:53.024 --> 20:55.527
Given her body of work,
could have been anyone.

20:55.527 --> 20:57.654
So anyone could have her half of the key?

20:58.780 --> 21:00.573
Not just anyone.

21:01.241 --> 21:03.326
I sent a man to find her.

21:03.326 --> 21:06.371
The only man she would have entrusted
with her half of the key.

21:06.371 --> 21:08.248
Does he have it, Kittridge?

21:08.248 --> 21:12.293
Well, at present, I don't know that, sir.
He's refused to come in.

21:12.919 --> 21:14.379
Refused?

21:15.255 --> 21:16.422
Who the hell is this guy?

21:16.422 --> 21:18.049
That's classified.

21:18.049 --> 21:21.219
I'm the goddamn
Director of National Intelligence.

21:21.219 --> 21:23.263
What exactly is it
I'm not supposed to know about?

21:23.263 --> 21:24.430
The IMF.

21:24.430 --> 21:26.015
- Mr. Kittridge.
- The world bank.

21:26.015 --> 21:27.433
No, that's
the International Monetary Fund.

21:27.433 --> 21:31.020
- Mr. Kittridge.
- No, I mean the other IMF. Ours.

21:31.020 --> 21:32.605
What does it stand for?

21:33.523 --> 21:35.775
Impossible Mission Force.

21:36.484 --> 21:39.362
- You're not serious.
- I'm afraid he is.

21:39.362 --> 21:41.072
And what do they do exactly?

21:41.072 --> 21:44.409
It's just as the name implies.
Whatever the rest of us can't.

21:44.409 --> 21:45.577
And who is in charge?

21:45.577 --> 21:49.372
They're not ones to take orders
in the traditional sense. We more or less...

21:51.666 --> 21:52.625
leave word.

21:54.168 --> 21:56.045
Leave word.

21:56.045 --> 21:57.672
Mr. Kittridge, sir.

21:57.672 --> 22:01.384
The IMF operates outside the community
and answers directly to the president.

22:01.384 --> 22:02.802
So let me get this straight.

22:02.802 --> 22:06.306
When there's a mission
none of you can handle,

22:06.973 --> 22:11.185
you just leave word for a nameless man

22:11.185 --> 22:13.813
and hope he gets the job done.

22:13.813 --> 22:14.814
Is that it?

22:14.814 --> 22:18.067
Should he choose to accept it.

22:18.067 --> 22:21.487
What the hell kind of outfit
gets to choose what orders to accept?

22:21.487 --> 22:23.364
The IMF was expressly created

22:23.364 --> 22:27.076
to ensure there would be
no unintended consequences.

22:27.076 --> 22:30.246
If they cannot ensure
a mission's ultimate outcome,

22:30.246 --> 22:32.582
they're authorized to decline.

23:24.092 --> 23:25.552
I understand.

23:26.427 --> 23:27.387
You're upset.

23:28.263 --> 23:30.056
I'm not upset, Kittridge.

23:31.474 --> 23:33.351
You wanted me to listen.

23:35.395 --> 23:37.105
This is me listening.

23:38.606 --> 23:39.899
All right.

23:40.441 --> 23:42.110
I put the bounty on Ilsa's head.

23:42.110 --> 23:44.320
I also told you how to find her!

23:45.405 --> 23:49.409
And I didn't ask her to steal the key.
She did that for reasons of her own.

23:49.409 --> 23:53.580
But that's the pattern, isn't it?

23:55.415 --> 24:00.295
You get her out of trouble
and she always found her way back in.

24:10.763 --> 24:12.223
Wait! Ilsa.

24:12.223 --> 24:14.893
Ilsa, wait! It's me!

24:14.893 --> 24:15.935
It's me.

24:23.067 --> 24:23.902
It's okay.

24:57.477 --> 25:00.438
Listen to me! You're dead! You stay dead!

25:01.189 --> 25:02.899
Ethan, wait!

25:07.237 --> 25:09.614
I'm not going to apologize to you, Hunt.

25:09.614 --> 25:11.991
It's my job to use you.

25:11.991 --> 25:14.744
Just like it's your job to be of use.

25:14.744 --> 25:18.498
Did you accomplish your mission or not?

25:22.919 --> 25:25.630
Wherever the other half of this is,

25:25.630 --> 25:28.800
whatever the completed key unlocks,

25:28.800 --> 25:30.385
I will find it.

25:32.011 --> 25:33.596
And then what?

25:34.180 --> 25:37.725
No one should be trusted
with control of the Entity.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.144
I mean to kill it.

25:40.144 --> 25:41.062
Ethan,

25:41.604 --> 25:43.648
the next world war
isn't gonna be a cold one.

25:43.648 --> 25:46.693
It's gonna be a shooting war,
a ballistic war

25:46.693 --> 25:48.695
over a rapidly shrinking ecosystem.

25:48.695 --> 25:51.865
It's gonna be a war
for the last of our dwindling energy,

25:51.865 --> 25:54.284
drinkable water, breathable air.

25:54.284 --> 25:58.371
Whoever controls the Entity
controls the truth.

25:59.831 --> 26:02.083
The concepts of right and wrong

26:02.083 --> 26:06.504
can be clearly defined for everyone
for centuries to come.

26:06.504 --> 26:08.256
Do you even hear yourself?

26:09.048 --> 26:13.344
Your days of fighting
for the so-called greater good

26:14.512 --> 26:15.680
are over.

26:16.472 --> 26:18.683
You need to pick a side.

26:19.225 --> 26:21.769
I'm on the same side I've always been on.

26:23.396 --> 26:25.064
Stay out of my way.

26:25.857 --> 26:27.483
I can't do that.

26:28.693 --> 26:32.614
We're gonna be coming after you.
The world's gonna be coming after you.

26:32.614 --> 26:36.701
And one way or another,
this mission of yours

26:36.701 --> 26:40.788
is gonna cost you dearly.

26:49.631 --> 26:52.467
If I don't get that,
we're gonna have company real soon.

27:09.609 --> 27:10.568
Hello?

27:10.568 --> 27:12.278
<i>Director Denlinger, please.</i>

27:13.154 --> 27:16.533
Director is unavailable at the moment.
How can I help you?

27:16.533 --> 27:19.827
- <i>To whom am I speaking?</i>
- CIA Director Eugene Kittridge.

27:19.827 --> 27:22.539
- <i>Designator?</i>
-"Bassnote," lowercase, all one word.

27:22.539 --> 27:25.917
<i>- Sir, we have a situation.</i>
- No kidding.

27:25.917 --> 27:29.879
<i>Your adjutant was found unconscious
in his home ten minutes ago.</i>

27:29.879 --> 27:31.297
<i>It appears he was drugged.</i>

27:31.297 --> 27:32.966
I understand.

27:32.966 --> 27:34.384
<i>I don't think you do, sir.</i>

27:34.384 --> 27:37.720
<i>Security has him entering this facility
15 minutes ago.</i>

27:37.720 --> 27:39.430
I understand, thank you.

27:39.430 --> 27:42.016
<i>Are you able to speak freely?</i>

27:42.016 --> 27:45.144
- No, thank you.
- <i>A security team is on their way.</i>

27:45.144 --> 27:48.356
<i>If you're in any danger, simply hang up
the phone before I count to five.</i>

27:48.356 --> 27:50.024
<i>One, two--</i>

27:53.611 --> 27:56.823
So just how do you plan
on getting out of here?

28:02.120 --> 28:03.496
Of course.

29:13.441 --> 29:14.567
<i>Listen up.</i>

29:14.567 --> 29:17.445
<i>An American operative
with a grievance against his country</i>

29:17.445 --> 29:19.948
<i>is missing and has malfunctioned.</i>

29:19.948 --> 29:22.951
His agenda represents a threat
to our national interests

29:22.951 --> 29:25.495
and he must be neutralized at all cost.

29:25.495 --> 29:28.831
Anything in this man's possession
is of vital importance

29:28.831 --> 29:31.084
and must be captured intact.

29:31.084 --> 29:33.795
The man himself is expendable.

29:33.795 --> 29:35.964
He is not to be underestimated.

29:35.964 --> 29:40.635
A master of infiltration, deception,
sabotage and psych warfare.

29:40.635 --> 29:43.304
For all intents and purposes,
ladies and gentlemen,

29:43.304 --> 29:46.224
a mind-reading, shape-shifting
incarnation of chaos.

29:46.224 --> 29:50.853
So, for your safety
and the safety of those around you,

29:50.853 --> 29:52.689
do not consider him secure

29:52.689 --> 29:56.609
unless you have driven a wooden stake
through his open heart.

29:57.277 --> 29:59.404
This is not a drill.

30:00.989 --> 30:04.284
A self-aware, self-learning,

30:04.284 --> 30:06.953
truth-eating digital parasite

30:07.829 --> 30:10.373
infesting all of cyberspace.

30:11.624 --> 30:13.793
Well, it was bound to happen
sooner or later.

30:13.793 --> 30:15.670
And the two halves of this key

30:15.670 --> 30:19.757
just might provide the means
of controlling this Entity.

30:19.757 --> 30:23.928
Meaning every government on the planet
would kill us just to get that key.

30:23.928 --> 30:25.096
Including our own.

30:25.096 --> 30:26.264
Exactly.

30:26.264 --> 30:28.391
Putting us on an unsanctioned mission

30:28.391 --> 30:31.019
which has gone rogue
before it even started.

30:31.019 --> 30:36.065
Meaning this very conversation
is technically an act of treason.

30:36.065 --> 30:39.402
Or as we like to call it, Monday.

30:41.362 --> 30:42.739
So what's the play?

30:42.739 --> 30:46.868
A buyer's coming in on Flight 746
from Amsterdam for a 30-minute layover,

30:46.868 --> 30:50.121
at which time he is hoping to purchase
that half of the key.

30:50.121 --> 30:52.790
And it stands to reason
the buyer will have

30:52.790 --> 30:54.834
the other half of the key
somewhere on their person.

30:54.834 --> 30:57.921
Being the only way
to authenticate our half.

30:57.921 --> 30:59.881
So how do we identify the buyer?

30:59.881 --> 31:01.132
This Geiger counter

31:01.132 --> 31:03.426
will detect a radiological signature
of the dragon's egg

31:03.426 --> 31:05.094
embedded in the buyer's key.

31:05.094 --> 31:08.014
The augmented-reality overlay
in these glasses

31:08.014 --> 31:09.641
will lead us to it.

31:11.517 --> 31:12.977
Oh, that's very clever.

31:12.977 --> 31:17.106
So, you ID the buyer, pick his pockets,
Bob's your uncle.

31:17.106 --> 31:19.734
- No.
- No. Of course not.

31:19.734 --> 31:22.654
The complete key is of no value
if we don't know what it unlocks.

31:22.654 --> 31:26.533
So you're going to sell the buyer
our half of the key.

31:26.533 --> 31:29.077
While we figure out
the buyer's connecting flight

31:29.077 --> 31:31.120
and book you a seat on that plane.

31:31.120 --> 31:34.165
So you can follow the key
wherever it goes.

31:34.165 --> 31:37.502
Which you hope is into the hands
of someone who knows what it unlocks.

31:37.502 --> 31:38.461
Precisely.

31:38.461 --> 31:40.755
Finding the completed key

31:41.589 --> 31:42.882
is only the beginning.

31:42.882 --> 31:47.845
The fate of the world depends on
finding whatever it unlocks.

31:51.140 --> 31:53.768
This guy, you know him?

31:54.894 --> 31:56.563
Not personally.

31:56.563 --> 31:58.481
But it is personal.

32:28.803 --> 32:29.804
Thank you.

32:36.227 --> 32:37.687
- Hey, what's that?
- What?

32:37.687 --> 32:40.398
Security alert.
Suspicious bag on its way to Venice.

32:41.316 --> 32:43.526
Nope, it's gone.
Must have been a false alarm.

32:51.951 --> 32:54.245
Overwatch, Snap Shot. Where's he at?

32:58.208 --> 32:59.959
Snap Shot, Overwatch. I have him.

32:59.959 --> 33:02.837
Terminal B, Gate 15, headed south.

33:05.131 --> 33:06.841
- I am so.
- You are not.

33:07.717 --> 33:10.720
Ethan, would you care to explain
to our friend, the Net Ranger,

33:10.720 --> 33:13.014
<i>how I am just as capable
of writing code as he is?</i>

33:13.014 --> 33:13.932
No comment.

33:13.932 --> 33:15.683
What, you figure Phineas Phreak here

33:15.683 --> 33:17.936
is gonna single-handedly work out
a way to kill the Entity

33:17.936 --> 33:19.938
<i>while I just hold his soldering iron?</i>

33:19.938 --> 33:21.773
- Probably.
- Definitely.

33:22.899 --> 33:24.192
Out of the way!

33:24.901 --> 33:26.569
Tell me where he is.

33:26.569 --> 33:29.864
- <i>Where is he?</i>
- Blue suit. Right in front of you.

33:55.598 --> 33:57.392
- It's not him.
- It's him.

33:57.392 --> 33:59.727
- <i>I'm telling you, it's not him.</i>
- And I'm telling you,

33:59.727 --> 34:01.980
facial comes back with a perfect--

34:05.817 --> 34:07.235
How did you do that?

34:07.235 --> 34:10.697
No one is safe from Phineas Phreak.

34:18.079 --> 34:19.581
- I got him!
- <i>Where is he?</i>

34:19.581 --> 34:21.624
Terminal E, Gate 5.

34:21.624 --> 34:24.586
Goddamn it, that's clear on the other side
of the airport.

34:27.296 --> 34:32.218
<i>Ethan, they're headed to Terminal E.
That side of the airport is all yours.</i>

34:33.135 --> 34:35.470
- Thank you, Luther. I see the buyer.
- <i>Got him.</i>

34:35.470 --> 34:38.557
The buyer is Otto Von Bork.
Swiss national.

34:38.557 --> 34:43.021
<i>He's connecting to Venice,
departing in 30 minutes on Flight 1031.</i>

34:43.021 --> 34:45.064
Benji, get me on that flight to Venice.

34:45.064 --> 34:47.650
Yep, Flight 1031 to Venice. Stand by.

35:00.163 --> 35:01.915
<i>Ethan, what just happened?</i>

35:01.915 --> 35:04.834
- He was bumped.
- Bumped? What do you mean, bumped?

35:04.834 --> 35:08.129
That woman picked his pocket.
Tag her. Tell me who she is.

35:17.055 --> 35:18.473
Luther, mute our comms.

35:19.015 --> 35:21.392
- What is it?
- That bag was on its way to Flight 1031.

35:21.392 --> 35:22.685
What bag?

35:22.685 --> 35:25.271
There was a suspicious bag alert
a few minutes ago.

35:25.271 --> 35:28.149
- So what about it?
- It was on its way to Flight 1031.

35:28.149 --> 35:31.528
To Venice. It's the buyer's plane.
It's Ethan's plane.

35:32.111 --> 35:33.988
Luther, do you copy? Who is she?

35:33.988 --> 35:35.698
What if it wasn't a false alarm?

35:35.698 --> 35:37.825
What if somebody's trying to
smuggle a bomb onto that plane?

35:37.825 --> 35:41.663
And what if that's what the Entity wants
us to think to keep Ethan off that plane?

35:41.663 --> 35:43.706
- <i>Luther, what's happening?</i>
- Should we warn him?

35:44.290 --> 35:46.459
- No.
<i>- Guys, guys? You hear me?</i>

35:46.459 --> 35:49.212
Find that bag. I'll direct you. Go.

35:49.212 --> 35:51.589
<i>Luther, just tell me,
is there something wrong?</i>

35:51.589 --> 35:54.968
Nothing to worry about.
It's under control.

35:54.968 --> 35:55.969
Got her.

35:55.969 --> 35:58.805
Info on the woman is coming... now.

36:01.891 --> 36:05.603
<i>Whoever she is, she's no spy.</i>

36:05.603 --> 36:07.689
She's a thief.

36:07.689 --> 36:09.107
<i>Where am I going, Luther?</i>

36:09.107 --> 36:11.401
Benji, there's a door
on your immediate left.

36:12.110 --> 36:13.945
<i>I'm unlocking it now.</i>

36:17.448 --> 36:20.660
The bag you're after is on tray 01833

36:20.660 --> 36:23.580
<i>heading towards the northwest corner
of the facility.</i>

36:23.580 --> 36:24.914
Copy that!

36:35.800 --> 36:36.801
Hi.

36:39.012 --> 36:40.263
Hello.

36:44.392 --> 36:45.727
Oh, I get it.

36:46.477 --> 36:48.271
You thought I was someone else.

36:50.315 --> 36:51.649
I'm not interested.

36:53.234 --> 36:54.652
Give me a chance.

36:55.320 --> 36:56.321
I'll scream.

36:58.156 --> 36:59.407
Please do.

37:02.535 --> 37:03.828
What do you want?

37:05.038 --> 37:06.206
This key.

37:08.124 --> 37:10.418
The one you picked from that man's pocket.

37:10.418 --> 37:11.920
It's worthless

37:11.920 --> 37:13.046
without this key.

37:15.298 --> 37:16.925
But together

37:16.925 --> 37:18.760
they're worth four million
in cryptocurrency

37:18.760 --> 37:20.553
that man was carrying on a flash drive.

37:22.430 --> 37:24.432
Well, I wouldn't know anything about that.

37:24.432 --> 37:26.100
Then why was this drive in your pocket?

37:27.769 --> 37:29.520
Who are you?

37:29.520 --> 37:31.272
You working with someone?

37:31.814 --> 37:34.400
Never. I'm strictly single-0.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.110
Today you got a partner.

37:36.110 --> 37:37.403
I need the man you stole this from

37:37.403 --> 37:40.490
to complete a transaction
and leave this airport with both of these

37:40.490 --> 37:42.158
without ever knowing his pocket was picked

37:42.158 --> 37:43.493
and before he boards his flight in--

37:43.493 --> 37:46.120
- <i>Seven minutes.</i>
- Seven minutes.

37:46.913 --> 37:49.374
We both know you're a good pickpocket.

37:49.374 --> 37:51.376
Let's see what kind of put-pocket you are.

37:53.211 --> 37:55.880
You expect me to put it back.

37:55.880 --> 37:58.007
Oh, I know you will.

37:58.007 --> 38:00.426
You're a thief. You want the money.

38:00.426 --> 38:02.303
And I can give it to you.

38:03.054 --> 38:06.683
Your choice. You're in or you're out.

38:09.227 --> 38:10.728
All right.

38:10.728 --> 38:11.896
So what's the play?

38:11.896 --> 38:14.023
<i>I sure hope you know what you're doing.</i>

38:14.691 --> 38:15.984
After you.

38:17.944 --> 38:20.488
Oh, I won't be needing this.

38:20.488 --> 38:22.532
I don't smoke.

38:23.408 --> 38:25.994
Keep it. Something to remember me by.

38:31.624 --> 38:35.962
Ethan, the alloy in that key
she took off the buyer doesn't match.

38:35.962 --> 38:38.715
- It's counterfeit.
- I expect nothing less.

38:38.715 --> 38:41.968
<i>But that doesn't change our objective.
The buyer has to leave with both keys.</i>

38:41.968 --> 38:43.928
<i>Talk to me, Luther! Where am I going?</i>

38:43.928 --> 38:45.930
Benji, head down the stairs
in front of you

38:45.930 --> 38:47.390
and the bag should be right there.

38:47.390 --> 38:49.017
Okay. I'm there. I'm there.

38:54.439 --> 38:55.690
That's him.

38:55.690 --> 38:57.358
<i>Right in front of you.</i>

38:58.818 --> 39:02.280
Okay, okay. Hey, sorry.
Thought you were somebody else.

39:03.990 --> 39:05.909
Hunt's jerking our chain.

39:06.576 --> 39:09.412
Everybody! Two-man teams, spread out.

39:09.412 --> 39:12.457
Ethan, our American friends
are getting wise.

39:12.457 --> 39:14.083
They're breaking up
and canvassing the airport.

39:14.083 --> 39:15.585
<i>Keep your eyes peeled.</i>

39:15.585 --> 39:17.378
So, what do I call you?

39:17.378 --> 39:19.839
How about Grace? And you?

39:19.839 --> 39:21.758
Well, listen, Grace.

39:21.758 --> 39:23.551
You should know
we're not the only interested party.

39:23.551 --> 39:25.511
If I tell you to run, you run.

39:25.511 --> 39:26.971
Run?

39:26.971 --> 39:28.556
This is getting exciting.

39:29.140 --> 39:30.683
Benji, have you got that bag?

39:30.683 --> 39:32.310
I found it!

39:45.865 --> 39:49.827
There's a cylindrical device inside.
I'm gonna take it out.

39:54.123 --> 39:55.083
<i>How we doing, Luther?</i>

39:55.667 --> 39:58.127
Ethan, the buyer's
in the waiting area above you.

39:58.127 --> 40:00.046
<i>Top of the escalator.</i>

40:02.090 --> 40:03.758
<i>All units are headed in your direction.</i>

40:03.758 --> 40:06.844
<i>Your location is going to be crawling
with agents anytime now.</i>

40:16.604 --> 40:18.356
Whatever it is, I've just activated it.

40:21.025 --> 40:23.027
Looks like we have five minutes.

40:25.280 --> 40:27.448
- <i>Also, it appears to be nuclear.</i>
- How big?

40:27.448 --> 40:29.492
Big enough to matter to everybody
in this airport, I suspect.

40:29.492 --> 40:32.036
- Can you disarm it?
- I haven't got any tools!

40:32.036 --> 40:34.289
- <i>Then find some.</i>
- Where am I gonna find--

40:58.479 --> 41:00.148
Is this where we run?

41:00.857 --> 41:01.691
Not yet.

41:02.650 --> 41:04.485
Benji, how are you doing with that bomb?

41:04.485 --> 41:05.570
Come on, come on.

41:07.322 --> 41:08.156
I got it!

41:08.781 --> 41:12.577
It's a cylinder cypher.
There's eight wheels.

41:12.577 --> 41:14.787
Looks like 14 letters on each wheel.

41:14.787 --> 41:17.498
1.5 billion possible combinations.

41:17.498 --> 41:18.917
Give or take.

41:20.168 --> 41:21.336
Oh, my God.

41:21.336 --> 41:23.046
<i>What now?</i>

41:23.046 --> 41:25.506
The wheels-- They spell out a message.

41:25.506 --> 41:27.175
U.R.DUNN.

41:27.175 --> 41:28.885
No way. Not yet, we aren't.

41:28.885 --> 41:30.845
No, Luther, not D-O-N-E.

41:30.845 --> 41:33.348
D-U-N-N.

41:33.348 --> 41:35.516
It's my last name.

41:39.395 --> 41:40.897
It knows who I am.

41:53.743 --> 41:55.453
Hold on. There's a message on the display.

41:56.079 --> 42:00.500
"I speak without a mouth, I fly through
the air without wings. What am I?"

42:00.500 --> 42:01.709
You got me. What?

42:01.709 --> 42:04.295
It's a riddle.
I suspect this thing is voice-activated.

42:04.295 --> 42:05.547
It wants me to say the answer.

42:05.547 --> 42:07.632
"I fly through the air..."

42:08.383 --> 42:09.551
An echo!

42:09.551 --> 42:11.261
That's it! That's it!

42:11.261 --> 42:12.720
Okay, new message.

42:12.720 --> 42:15.390
"Are you afraid of death?"

42:15.390 --> 42:17.684
- What kind of a riddle is that?
- <i>It's not a riddle.</i>

42:17.684 --> 42:19.936
It's a psychometric test.

42:19.936 --> 42:23.690
The more questions you answer,
the more it'll know about you.

42:23.690 --> 42:25.692
"Are you afraid of death?" No!

42:26.985 --> 42:29.988
- <i>Did it work?</i>
- I lied. It knows.

42:29.988 --> 42:32.323
Just tell it the truth. Say it.

42:32.323 --> 42:35.201
"Are you afraid of death?" Yes! Who isn't?

42:45.128 --> 42:48.923
Okay. "What's always approaching
but never arrives?"

42:48.923 --> 42:50.216
Wait, I know this one.

42:50.216 --> 42:51.718
The clock is ticking, Luther.

42:51.718 --> 42:53.803
Riddles aren't my thing, Benji.
What more can I say?

42:53.803 --> 42:55.597
We're running out of time!

42:56.139 --> 42:57.682
There he is.

42:57.682 --> 42:59.434
Oh, this is too easy.

42:59.434 --> 43:01.352
<i>Sorry to bother you, Ethan.</i>

43:01.352 --> 43:04.147
Would you happen to know
what's always approaching

43:04.689 --> 43:06.149
but never arrives?

43:06.149 --> 43:08.568
What is always approaching
but never arrives?

43:08.568 --> 43:09.694
Tomorrow.

43:10.361 --> 43:11.196
What?

43:11.196 --> 43:13.781
Always approaching but never arrives. Tomorrow.

43:14.866 --> 43:16.242
- It's tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

43:16.242 --> 43:17.869
Tomorrow! Tomorrow!

43:17.869 --> 43:19.579
Yes! Okay, next question.

43:19.579 --> 43:20.788
Give me the goods.

43:21.664 --> 43:24.125
- I'll be watching.
- You don't trust me?

43:30.089 --> 43:31.591
Luther, what is happening?

43:31.591 --> 43:35.094
Nothing to worry about.
Everything is under control.

43:35.094 --> 43:36.012
Okay, next question.

43:36.012 --> 43:39.057
"Who or what is
the most important thing to you?"

43:39.057 --> 43:40.350
Say it.

43:40.350 --> 43:42.477
- But if I--
- There's no other choice. Say it.

43:43.353 --> 43:44.854
My friends.

43:45.772 --> 43:46.606
Bastard.

43:58.368 --> 44:00.370
- Is he--
- Yes, he is.

44:00.370 --> 44:02.372
Give me the money, give me the key.

44:03.331 --> 44:06.084
Okay. "What gets bigger
the more you take away?"

44:06.084 --> 44:08.503
- A hole.
- A hole. Brilliant!

44:20.723 --> 44:22.308
I've got no more questions
and there's one more wheel.

44:22.308 --> 44:24.561
How am I supposed to give answers
if I've got no questions?

44:24.561 --> 44:26.062
That must be your final test.

44:26.062 --> 44:27.897
I've got 45 seconds!

44:31.234 --> 44:32.610
What happens now?

44:32.610 --> 44:34.737
I'm thinking. Don't move.

44:34.737 --> 44:37.365
I'm pinned down. Need a way out of here.
Where am I going?

44:37.365 --> 44:38.783
We have a bigger problem, Ethan.

44:38.783 --> 44:40.952
It's very possible
no one is getting out of here.

44:40.952 --> 44:41.870
What?

44:41.870 --> 44:44.706
There's a bomb in baggage handling.
A nuclear bomb.

44:44.706 --> 44:47.333
<i>The question I asked you
is part of the code for disarming it.</i>

44:47.333 --> 44:48.751
Stop, stop, stop!

44:51.004 --> 44:52.088
Why didn't you tell me this?

44:52.088 --> 44:54.340
You had a lot going on.
We didn't want to bother you.

44:54.340 --> 44:58.219
Listen to me. A nuclear bomb is something
you bother me with immediately.

44:58.219 --> 44:59.762
- How much time?
- Twenty seconds.

45:00.555 --> 45:01.598
Twenty seconds?

45:01.598 --> 45:04.017
There's one more riddle.
I'm working on it. Fifteen seconds!

45:04.017 --> 45:06.102
Easy, easy. What's the riddle?

45:06.102 --> 45:08.229
In the time it takes me to explain,
we'll all be dead!

45:08.229 --> 45:09.147
Come on, Benji.

45:09.147 --> 45:11.107
Why do we always
end up in these situations?

45:11.107 --> 45:12.650
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

45:12.650 --> 45:14.277
<i>Nine... eight...</i>

45:14.277 --> 45:17.488
seven... six... five...

45:28.833 --> 45:30.001
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

45:30.001 --> 45:30.960
What is it?

45:32.795 --> 45:35.131
- It's empty.
- What do you mean, empty?

45:35.131 --> 45:36.549
<i>There's nothing inside.</i>

45:42.013 --> 45:42.931
She took the key.

45:42.931 --> 45:45.016
- Which key?
- Our key. The real key.

45:45.016 --> 45:46.059
- What?
- <i>Luther, find her.</i>

45:56.486 --> 45:58.071
I got her. She's headed for Terminal E.

46:10.583 --> 46:12.544
- No, it can't be.
- What is it?

46:13.086 --> 46:14.671
Luther, Benji. Abort. Get out!

46:14.671 --> 46:16.881
- Where do we rendezvous?
- We don't!

46:16.881 --> 46:19.634
This mission is terminated. Get out now.

46:31.187 --> 46:33.940
Hunt! Stop right there!

46:33.940 --> 46:35.859
You see him? Where is he?

46:35.859 --> 46:37.735
Excuse me! Excuse me!

46:37.735 --> 46:40.029
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

47:17.734 --> 47:19.694
- Move!
- Move, move!

48:01.819 --> 48:03.821
He's got to be here somewhere.

48:05.114 --> 48:06.908
Goddamn.

48:17.460 --> 48:20.046
What we have here is shortwave radio,

48:20.046 --> 48:24.676
magnetic audio recording,
cathode ray tube monitors.

48:24.676 --> 48:27.387
No more ones and zeros.

48:27.387 --> 48:30.390
It's a fully analog, offline safe room,

48:30.390 --> 48:33.393
shielded from our digitally-based Entity.

48:34.686 --> 48:36.604
Where is this feed coming from?

48:36.604 --> 48:39.858
CORONA spy satellite from the Cold War.

48:40.567 --> 48:42.485
Had no idea we were still
using those things.

48:42.485 --> 48:44.237
Yeah, well, we weren't.

48:44.237 --> 48:46.531
Gave them to the National Weather Service
20 years ago.

48:46.531 --> 48:48.700
This is the last one still functioning.

48:48.700 --> 48:52.829
So, will this thing help us find
your nameless IMF man?

48:52.829 --> 48:54.873
Nothing can do that, sir.

48:54.873 --> 48:58.585
But it has allowed us
to keep tabs on this woman.

49:00.461 --> 49:03.339
She was seen with our man
at the airport in Abu Dhabi.

49:04.424 --> 49:05.425
Who is she?

49:06.509 --> 49:08.261
Where is she now?

49:19.647 --> 49:23.443
You are here because Italian police
received an anonymous tip

49:23.443 --> 49:25.445
that a woman matching your description

49:25.445 --> 49:28.781
would be arriving on the afternoon flight
from Abu Dhabi.

49:28.781 --> 49:32.785
This woman had
multiple passports in her possession.

49:33.411 --> 49:36.956
This one is wanted for fraud
in Saint Petersburg.

49:37.665 --> 49:40.835
Jewel theft in Antwerp.
Art theft in Monaco.

49:40.835 --> 49:44.214
Graft in Milan. Extortion in Mumbai.

49:44.214 --> 49:46.758
But this is my favorite--

49:46.758 --> 49:48.968
resisting arrest in Rio.

49:51.262 --> 49:53.223
Which leads me to wonder,

49:54.307 --> 49:55.934
which one of these women is you?

49:56.976 --> 49:59.145
I've never seen these before in my life.

49:59.145 --> 50:00.647
They were in your purse.

50:00.647 --> 50:03.650
And your picture is in every one.

50:03.650 --> 50:05.902
- May I see?
- Please.

50:11.616 --> 50:13.243
Yes, it's an amazing likeness,

50:13.243 --> 50:15.411
but it isn't me.

50:16.204 --> 50:17.747
As I keep telling you,

50:18.957 --> 50:22.210
I'm a schoolteacher from Brighton.
I'm on a sabbatical.

50:22.210 --> 50:24.420
Whatever you're involved in,

50:24.420 --> 50:28.049
you've obviously made
some very powerful enemies.

50:38.726 --> 50:39.561
Okay.

50:43.481 --> 50:45.024
Her lawyer is here.

50:45.024 --> 50:46.484
My lawyer?

51:21.769 --> 51:23.646
Magistrate Spezzi.

51:24.272 --> 51:25.607
I'm sorry. Who are you?

51:26.232 --> 51:27.901
Interpol.

51:28.651 --> 51:32.947
I've come regarding the arrest
of the woman from Abu Dhabi.

51:33.489 --> 51:36.618
I'll need to inventory the items
on her person at the time of her arrest.

51:37.410 --> 51:39.746
May I see some identification, please?

51:40.580 --> 51:41.539
Where's the rest?

51:42.290 --> 51:44.083
I assure you, this is everything.

51:44.626 --> 51:47.503
- What was your name?
- She left Abu Dhabi with a certain key.

51:48.129 --> 51:49.464
There was no key.

51:49.464 --> 51:51.466
It was an unusual sort.

51:52.508 --> 51:54.969
One that you could mistake for a pendant.

51:55.678 --> 51:59.265
The kind that you'd be tempted
to hang on a chain

51:59.265 --> 52:00.850
around Amelia's neck.

52:02.685 --> 52:03.645
Amelia?

52:04.646 --> 52:05.939
Your wife.

52:06.648 --> 52:09.567
Mother of your lovely daughter, Serena.

52:09.567 --> 52:11.569
You're not Interpol.

52:11.569 --> 52:13.655
I am if I wish to be.

52:14.739 --> 52:17.825
I can be anything, and I know everything.

52:18.409 --> 52:21.788
I know this wouldn't be the first time
you've helped yourself to stolen goods.

52:21.788 --> 52:22.956
A Cartier bracelet.

52:23.831 --> 52:25.708
You were cleared of suspicion,

52:25.708 --> 52:27.835
but we both know you gave it
to your mistress, Valeria.

52:28.378 --> 52:31.881
On August 21st. Her 29th birthday.

52:31.881 --> 52:33.800
Who are you?

52:35.718 --> 52:37.929
I'm gonna have to search you,

52:37.929 --> 52:39.264
just to be sure.

52:43.685 --> 52:46.229
Your secretary's no longer with us.

52:59.450 --> 53:00.869
Thank you officers.

53:03.371 --> 53:04.455
Please.

53:05.665 --> 53:07.959
You can wait outside. Thank you.

53:24.517 --> 53:26.060
You.

53:26.060 --> 53:27.687
You did this.

53:27.687 --> 53:32.192
I called the police. I didn't tell them
about your colorful past.

53:33.610 --> 53:34.903
That's on you.

53:35.445 --> 53:39.574
You put-pocketed that key on another
passenger before you were arrested.

53:39.574 --> 53:42.577
<i>You exchanged details
and arranged to meet later on.</i>

53:42.577 --> 53:44.245
<i>Right now someone out there</i>

53:44.245 --> 53:46.956
<i>hasn't the slightest clue
they're holding on to that key for you.</i>

53:47.665 --> 53:50.501
<i>An unwitting courier.
The perfect accomplice.</i>

53:51.794 --> 53:55.089
<i>I'm guessing a man... middle-aged?</i>

53:55.089 --> 53:59.636
A man waiting his whole life
to be noticed by a woman like you.

54:01.054 --> 54:02.263
An orphan.

54:03.640 --> 54:06.976
Highly intelligent.
Inherently resourceful.

54:06.976 --> 54:10.563
Growing up in poverty
left you longing for the finer things.

54:11.439 --> 54:13.066
Other people's things.

54:13.691 --> 54:17.362
Someone saw your potential
and helped you hone your skills.

54:17.946 --> 54:20.532
Skills that gave you
the life you thought you wanted.

54:20.532 --> 54:24.077
Tailored clothes,
fine dining, luxury hotels.

54:24.077 --> 54:27.038
Skills that kept you
one step ahead of the law,

54:27.956 --> 54:29.290
until now.

54:31.209 --> 54:34.462
You can't blame a girl
for trying to make a dishonest living.

54:35.255 --> 54:39.842
You had no idea what you were stealing.
Otherwise you never would have stolen it.

54:41.636 --> 54:42.637
Tell you what.

54:42.637 --> 54:46.224
You get me out of here,
and I'll take you straight to the key.

54:46.224 --> 54:47.809
I have a better idea.

54:47.809 --> 54:49.477
You're gonna tell me everything.

54:49.477 --> 54:51.604
Then I'll think about getting you
out of here.

54:51.604 --> 54:53.773
Now start with who hired you.

54:53.773 --> 54:56.901
And don't lie to me, because I'll know.

54:56.901 --> 54:58.736
I have no idea who hired me.

54:58.736 --> 55:01.114
Contact with the client
was almost entirely electronic.

55:01.114 --> 55:02.240
- Email?
- Texts.

55:02.240 --> 55:03.575
- Encrypted?
- Naturally.

55:03.575 --> 55:04.909
- Almost?
- Pardon?

55:04.909 --> 55:08.121
You said contact with the client
was "almost" entirely electronic.

55:08.121 --> 55:10.707
There was a dead drop in a café
in Luxembourg.

55:10.707 --> 55:12.542
- An envelope.
- What was in the envelope?

55:12.542 --> 55:14.711
A ticket to Abu Dhabi.

55:15.545 --> 55:17.255
And...

55:17.255 --> 55:20.341
a picture of you.

55:21.885 --> 55:23.970
My instructions
were to follow you at the airport.

55:23.970 --> 55:25.346
You'd be tailing a mark.

55:25.346 --> 55:28.641
Said mark would have a key
and four million in cryptocurrency.

55:28.641 --> 55:31.185
That drive was useless, by the way.
It was empty.

55:31.811 --> 55:34.898
The only hope I have of getting paid
is to deliver your half of the key.

55:34.898 --> 55:37.442
And you were instructed to deliver it to...

55:37.442 --> 55:38.443
Venice.

55:38.443 --> 55:41.154
Party at Ducale Palace.
Tomorrow. Midnight.

55:44.699 --> 55:45.909
You expecting someone?

55:45.909 --> 55:49.454
Your friends from the airport.
Saw them in the hallway a few minutes ago.

55:52.207 --> 55:54.292
You could have said something sooner.

55:54.292 --> 55:57.128
Well, they were chasing you, not me.

56:19.359 --> 56:21.152
A <i>pervertito!</i>

56:22.820 --> 56:24.280
No, Grace.

56:26.658 --> 56:27.617
No, no, no.

56:27.617 --> 56:29.827
She's my client.

56:32.372 --> 56:33.331
Grace.

56:38.503 --> 56:39.796
No, no.

57:12.412 --> 57:14.747
No, no! Move! Move!

57:17.834 --> 57:19.168
Sorry!

57:35.852 --> 57:37.145
Who parks like that?

57:55.622 --> 57:57.749
Grace! You gotta pull over.

57:58.416 --> 57:59.250
Grace.

57:59.250 --> 58:02.545
Pull over. Listen.
I'm trying to help you! Grace!

58:09.928 --> 58:11.054
Bring her to me.

58:41.334 --> 58:44.212
Are you okay? You okay? No, no, no.

58:44.212 --> 58:45.213
We're okay.

58:51.094 --> 58:52.470
Give me your hand.

58:52.470 --> 58:55.223
Slow, slow, slow. It's okay.

58:55.765 --> 58:57.141
Slow.

58:57.141 --> 58:59.769
Is anything broken?
Are you okay? You okay?

58:59.769 --> 59:00.770
Hunt!

59:01.563 --> 59:02.939
It's over!

59:03.481 --> 59:05.316
Let the girl go.

59:05.316 --> 59:06.943
Put the bracelets on.

59:07.944 --> 59:11.322
There you go. Put them on. Do it!

59:11.322 --> 59:13.575
It's okay. He's not gonna shoot you.

59:16.911 --> 59:18.121
Put your weapons down now.

59:19.497 --> 59:22.208
Special Operations.
He's wanted for terrorism.

59:23.209 --> 59:26.045
Goddamn it, Degas, get rid of those women.

59:26.045 --> 59:28.256
Hunt, listen to me. Listen to me.

59:28.256 --> 59:30.341
Let her go and put them on.

59:31.551 --> 59:32.927
Put your weapons down now.

59:32.927 --> 59:33.970
It's all under control.

59:33.970 --> 59:36.931
It's okay! It's okay! It's okay!

59:40.184 --> 59:41.895
Everybody down! Get down!

59:47.358 --> 59:50.069
- Down, down!
- Cover, cover! Cover!

01:00:20.558 --> 01:00:22.644
- You're driving.
- What?

01:00:22.644 --> 01:00:24.187
No, no, no!

01:00:25.313 --> 01:00:26.689
Go, go, go. Hit the accelerator.

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:28.107
Go, go, go!

01:00:37.825 --> 01:00:38.910
Go, go, go!

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:57.387
Get in!

01:00:57.387 --> 01:00:59.138
You're good. Just keep it going.

01:00:59.138 --> 01:01:00.682
Don't stop.

01:01:10.775 --> 01:01:11.609
Car, car, car.

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:23.454
It's okay. Just put your foot
on the brake. Start the car.

01:01:23.454 --> 01:01:24.789
Wait, wait, wait!

01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:27.375
- What's happening?
- I'm done. I'm not doing this.

01:01:27.375 --> 01:01:29.043
People are chasing us.

01:01:29.043 --> 01:01:32.380
Yes, they are. You're driving.
Now, come on.

01:02:03.536 --> 01:02:05.246
Who is that person?

01:02:05.246 --> 01:02:06.748
I have no idea.

01:02:11.628 --> 01:02:13.713
- You okay?
- I will be when this is over.

01:02:16.424 --> 01:02:17.842
Oh, man.

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.598
It's okay. It's okay.

01:02:36.194 --> 01:02:37.612
Is there anyone not chasing us?

01:02:38.321 --> 01:02:39.572
We gotta get rid of this car.

01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:44.327
Scooters! Damn it.

01:03:05.557 --> 01:03:07.433
What are we doing?

01:03:09.602 --> 01:03:10.812
Finding us a new car.

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:33.710
Okay.

01:03:50.810 --> 01:03:52.562
- Just give me a second.
- Yeah.

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:54.272
- Thanks. Okay?
- Yeah.

01:03:54.272 --> 01:03:56.024
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

01:03:59.652 --> 01:04:01.196
- Wow.
- You okay?

01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:04.490
Yeah, look, I'm sorry. This is...

01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:06.576
- It's okay.
- No, this car, the way they...

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:07.493
It's okay.

01:04:07.493 --> 01:04:09.454
No, the way they set them up,
sometimes it's just...

01:04:09.454 --> 01:04:11.372
- Let's go.
- It takes me...

01:04:19.881 --> 01:04:23.801
<i>Traffic cameras have picked up the woman
on facial recognition.</i>

01:04:23.801 --> 01:04:25.762
<i>She is now in a yellow Fiat 500.</i>

01:04:26.471 --> 01:04:27.764
<i>Units are in pursuit.</i>

01:04:42.403 --> 01:04:44.948
Now I got you.

01:04:53.748 --> 01:04:54.958
Looks like we lost them.

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:22.068
Let's just--

01:05:22.068 --> 01:05:23.027
Move, move, move!

01:05:40.461 --> 01:05:42.005
Baby, baby, baby!

01:05:54.893 --> 01:05:56.185
Wait, what?

01:05:56.978 --> 01:05:57.937
No, no, no.

01:06:04.027 --> 01:06:05.069
Go, go, go!

01:06:08.573 --> 01:06:09.449
Go straight.

01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:20.001
- Just take your foot off the accelerator.
- We're on fire. We're on fire!

01:06:20.001 --> 01:06:21.920
It's the tires. Just try to go straight.

01:06:24.047 --> 01:06:25.632
- Hang on.
- Why is it spinning?

01:06:27.634 --> 01:06:28.968
Good, good, good!

01:06:31.387 --> 01:06:32.972
I've got it, I've got it, I've got it.

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:36.851
- Turn right. Down there. Right there!
- Come on!

01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:46.861
Got to go right. Turn right!

01:06:49.656 --> 01:06:51.908
- Who's driving?
- You're driving.

01:06:51.908 --> 01:06:53.618
Go, go, go. Just go straight.

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:55.578
Go, go, go.

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:58.081
Just keep going straight.

01:06:58.081 --> 01:07:01.584
Or left. Go, go, go. You're doing good.

01:07:07.465 --> 01:07:08.967
Cops! A lot of cops!

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.761
Take the wheel.

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:13.429
Brake, brake, brake.

01:07:18.851 --> 01:07:20.603
Okay, your wheel.

01:07:22.522 --> 01:07:23.815
Straight?

01:07:23.815 --> 01:07:25.441
- Right, right, right.
- Got it.

01:07:34.158 --> 01:07:35.869
- Which way now?
- Left, left, left.

01:07:44.377 --> 01:07:46.004
Okay. You're good, you're good.

01:07:50.884 --> 01:07:52.093
That's a person.

01:07:54.762 --> 01:07:56.639
- Car, car.
- I see it!

01:08:23.208 --> 01:08:24.041
Hit it.

01:08:31.758 --> 01:08:32.925
Hang on!

01:08:44.603 --> 01:08:47.440
- What is happening? Where are we going?
- I don't know.

01:08:48.483 --> 01:08:50.151
Okay, brake, brake, brake!

01:09:19.847 --> 01:09:21.182
Don't hate me.

01:09:24.561 --> 01:09:25.937
Grace? Grace!

01:09:41.494 --> 01:09:42.661
Come on, come on.

01:10:11.024 --> 01:10:12.108
Ethan!

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:13.860
Ethan!

01:10:17.488 --> 01:10:19.407
Well, come on.

01:11:14.462 --> 01:11:17.090
All right. We know Grace
has one half of the key.

01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:19.634
We also know she's gonna be
at the Ducale at midnight.

01:11:19.634 --> 01:11:23.346
And now we have a pretty good idea
as to who will be waiting for her there.

01:11:23.346 --> 01:11:25.098
The event is being hosted
by none other than

01:11:25.098 --> 01:11:29.310
our favorite international arms trafficker
and black marketeer, Alana Mitsopolis.

01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:31.229
The White Widow.

01:11:31.771 --> 01:11:34.399
Does she know who you actually are
or does she still think

01:11:34.399 --> 01:11:37.318
you're the globally notorious
mass murderer John Lark?

01:11:37.318 --> 01:11:39.153
Who says I'm not?

01:11:39.153 --> 01:11:41.531
Didn't she put a price
on your head in Paris?

01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:45.743
She did indeed.
She and Ethan, they worked it out.

01:11:46.327 --> 01:11:47.996
You never did tell me how.

01:11:47.996 --> 01:11:49.747
Can we continue, please?

01:11:49.747 --> 01:11:50.790
Right.

01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:53.459
Assuming we get the complete key
at the party tonight,

01:11:53.459 --> 01:11:56.754
we still don't know what it unlocks,
so we need to find somebody who does.

01:11:56.754 --> 01:11:59.591
The question is where to start looking.

01:11:59.591 --> 01:12:02.468
We figured that the bomb didn't
just walk into the airport by itself.

01:12:02.468 --> 01:12:03.928
Right? Somebody put it there.

01:12:03.928 --> 01:12:06.598
Somebody working for the Entity.

01:12:06.598 --> 01:12:10.184
This is everything I captured from
the security cameras at the airport

01:12:10.184 --> 01:12:12.562
up to the minute everything went haywire.

01:12:12.562 --> 01:12:15.857
And this is the feed
from your AR sunglasses.

01:12:15.857 --> 01:12:18.943
I've been running facial recognition
on everyone in the airport.

01:12:18.943 --> 01:12:20.278
See anything strange?

01:12:23.615 --> 01:12:24.991
It's like a ghost.

01:12:24.991 --> 01:12:26.743
Ghosts don't have reflections.

01:12:30.455 --> 01:12:34.500
The only person in the airport
with no identity.

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:38.838
The only man who can't be found
anyplace else in the airport

01:12:38.838 --> 01:12:41.716
except that reflection.

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:44.010
He's being erased.

01:12:44.552 --> 01:12:46.095
In real time.

01:12:52.769 --> 01:12:54.062
The Entity.

01:12:55.396 --> 01:12:56.731
It's protecting him.

01:12:57.315 --> 01:12:59.317
You saw him, didn't you?

01:13:01.778 --> 01:13:03.154
I wasn't sure.

01:13:04.656 --> 01:13:05.907
Well, who is he?

01:13:13.331 --> 01:13:15.124
Someone I thought

01:13:16.334 --> 01:13:18.086
died a long time ago.

01:13:18.086 --> 01:13:19.837
In another life.

01:13:20.421 --> 01:13:21.923
Before the IMF.

01:13:22.966 --> 01:13:25.969
Before I was offered the choice.

01:13:29.097 --> 01:13:30.640
And in a very real sense,

01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:34.185
he made me who I am today.

01:13:35.395 --> 01:13:37.188
Does he have a name?

01:13:37.188 --> 01:13:39.732
He calls himself Gabriel.

01:13:42.694 --> 01:13:44.153
You know him.

01:13:46.406 --> 01:13:48.283
There is no knowing him.

01:13:49.325 --> 01:13:51.786
He has no recorded past.

01:13:51.786 --> 01:13:53.872
The Entity made sure of that.

01:13:54.789 --> 01:13:56.207
He's a dark messiah.

01:13:56.207 --> 01:13:59.335
The Entity's chosen messenger.

01:13:59.335 --> 01:14:00.879
And he sees death

01:14:01.963 --> 01:14:05.633
as a gift he wants to share
with the rest of the world.

01:14:06.217 --> 01:14:07.218
How do you know this?

01:14:07.218 --> 01:14:11.055
I still have a few friends left in MI6.

01:14:11.055 --> 01:14:15.560
Friends who are afraid of the British
government gaining control of the Entity.

01:14:16.394 --> 01:14:19.981
Any attempt to try to stop them
would be seen as an act of treason.

01:14:19.981 --> 01:14:21.566
And because you're disavowed,

01:14:21.566 --> 01:14:25.320
your friends called
and asked you for help.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.239
They knew Gabriel serves the Entity.

01:14:28.239 --> 01:14:30.158
They knew he was on his way to Istanbul

01:14:30.158 --> 01:14:33.953
to acquire one half of a cruciform key.

01:14:35.163 --> 01:14:37.916
So I beat him to it.

01:14:39.334 --> 01:14:41.419
And when Kittridge
put a bounty on your head,

01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:44.464
you went to the desert to hide.

01:14:44.464 --> 01:14:47.300
But somehow the bounty hunters
found you anyway.

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.426
Yes.

01:14:48.426 --> 01:14:52.931
So, did these friends of yours
happen to say what the key unlocks?

01:14:52.931 --> 01:14:57.310
MI6 suspects it leads somehow
to the Entity's source code.

01:14:57.310 --> 01:14:58.811
Source code.

01:14:59.687 --> 01:15:01.064
When were you gonna tell me this?

01:15:02.315 --> 01:15:03.525
I'm telling you now.

01:15:05.276 --> 01:15:07.695
Your friends at MI6,
how'd they contact you?

01:15:07.695 --> 01:15:09.656
Did you speak with them? Face to face?

01:15:09.656 --> 01:15:11.282
I'm disavowed.

01:15:11.282 --> 01:15:15.078
They couldn't risk meeting me in person,
so all communication--

01:15:17.247 --> 01:15:20.208
Was electronic. Was digital.

01:15:23.962 --> 01:15:25.922
No. We can't be sure that was the Entity.

01:15:25.922 --> 01:15:27.882
We can't be sure it wasn't.

01:15:27.882 --> 01:15:31.344
We can't be sure anything is real
outside of this very conversation.

01:15:33.096 --> 01:15:34.138
None of you should be here.

01:15:34.138 --> 01:15:36.683
- Ethan--
- No. You don't know Gabriel. I do.

01:15:36.683 --> 01:15:38.643
It's not the killing he enjoys.

01:15:38.643 --> 01:15:40.645
It's the suffering it causes.

01:15:40.645 --> 01:15:42.730
And he knows the best way to get to me

01:15:43.356 --> 01:15:45.066
is through all of you.

01:15:46.234 --> 01:15:47.944
And if Gabriel knows me...

01:15:47.944 --> 01:15:49.612
The Entity knows.

01:15:49.612 --> 01:15:52.574
There's a reason he wants me here.
There's...

01:15:53.241 --> 01:15:56.494
There's a reason he wants you here.
It wants you here.

01:15:56.494 --> 01:16:00.164
"Who or what is
the most important thing to you?"

01:16:01.124 --> 01:16:03.334
No. You have to go. You all have to go.

01:16:03.334 --> 01:16:06.296
- Ethan, what if it wants us to leave?
- Like you made us leave the airport.

01:16:06.296 --> 01:16:08.882
What if it wants you alone
at that party tonight?

01:16:08.882 --> 01:16:11.092
Then I go alone. At least I don't have
all of you to worry about.

01:16:11.092 --> 01:16:13.386
This is exactly why
I didn't want to tell you.

01:16:13.386 --> 01:16:16.931
Ethan, you're playing
four-dimensional chess with an algorithm.

01:16:16.931 --> 01:16:18.516
The Entity knows who we are.

01:16:18.516 --> 01:16:21.394
Any move we make,
it's probably considered it.

01:16:21.394 --> 01:16:24.397
Anything we do, we have to assume
that it's counting on us to do it.

01:16:24.397 --> 01:16:28.484
If you want to beat this thing,
you have to start thinking like it.

01:16:28.484 --> 01:16:31.946
Cold, logical, unemotional.

01:16:31.946 --> 01:16:35.450
If that key really does
grant control of the Entity,

01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:38.912
Gabriel is the last person on Earth
who should have it.

01:16:38.912 --> 01:16:40.455
She's right, Ethan.

01:16:40.455 --> 01:16:43.625
Gabriel cannot have that key.

01:16:43.625 --> 01:16:47.629
And none of our lives
can matter more than this mission.

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:56.012
I don't accept that.

01:17:22.247 --> 01:17:24.332
It's my first time in Venice.

01:17:28.336 --> 01:17:29.796
It's mine, too.

01:18:31.399 --> 01:18:32.775
Buy you a drink?

01:18:33.610 --> 01:18:35.320
I'm waiting for someone.

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.279
So am I.

01:18:38.615 --> 01:18:41.492
We can wait together. I'm Gabriel.

01:18:41.492 --> 01:18:43.244
If you say so.

01:18:44.037 --> 01:18:45.455
And you're Grace.

01:18:55.006 --> 01:18:56.216
I don't have it on me.

01:18:56.216 --> 01:18:58.551
I wouldn't expect you to.

01:18:58.551 --> 01:19:00.470
In any case, I'm not here for the key.

01:19:01.596 --> 01:19:02.639
What do you want?

01:19:02.639 --> 01:19:05.433
Suppose while we're waiting
I tell you a little story.

01:19:05.433 --> 01:19:08.019
You're obviously not the person
I came here to meet.

01:19:08.019 --> 01:19:09.854
It's your story, Grace.

01:19:11.022 --> 01:19:12.857
I know how it ends.

01:19:14.025 --> 01:19:16.653
Let me buy you a drink
and perhaps we can change it.

01:19:44.514 --> 01:19:46.099
Let's go to a party.

01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:55.483
Excuse me, sir.

01:19:57.277 --> 01:19:59.028
Would you please follow me?

01:20:00.613 --> 01:20:04.367
It's important you understand
that you're not unique.

01:20:05.034 --> 01:20:06.119
Thirty years ago...

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.413
her name was Marie.

01:20:09.038 --> 01:20:12.125
The first of many women
who trusted our mutual friend.

01:20:12.125 --> 01:20:14.752
Women who all have something he wants.

01:20:15.336 --> 01:20:19.132
Women who are all in over their heads,
or so he tells them.

01:20:19.883 --> 01:20:21.509
Sound familiar?

01:20:21.509 --> 01:20:23.511
What happened to Marie?

01:20:23.511 --> 01:20:26.347
Same thing that happens
to all the women he uses,

01:20:27.223 --> 01:20:29.893
as well as anyone else
who touches that key.

01:20:29.893 --> 01:20:32.437
He doesn't care
whether people live or die.

01:20:32.437 --> 01:20:35.899
He cares only about his objective.

01:20:36.733 --> 01:20:38.693
And right now,
the only thing standing in his way

01:20:39.485 --> 01:20:40.612
is you.

01:20:41.696 --> 01:20:44.157
- Why should I believe you?
- You shouldn't.

01:20:44.157 --> 01:20:46.826
You've stepped
into a world of lies, Grace.

01:20:46.826 --> 01:20:48.077
Nothing anyone says is true.

01:20:48.995 --> 01:20:52.165
Just remember that
when he promises to protect you.

01:20:52.165 --> 01:20:53.291
Grace.

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:09.974
It's been a long time, Ethan.

01:21:10.558 --> 01:21:12.685
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:16.648
Good evening, everyone.

01:21:16.648 --> 01:21:19.359
If it isn't John Lark.

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.487
Except it isn't, actually.

01:21:23.029 --> 01:21:25.281
But until you're ready
to tell me your real name,

01:21:25.281 --> 01:21:27.825
Lark will have to do.

01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:30.453
It's good to see you, Alana.

01:21:34.123 --> 01:21:37.210
And you're Gabriel, I presume.

01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:40.255
I've heard so very little about you.

01:21:40.255 --> 01:21:43.591
Aren't you so much more
handsome in person?

01:21:46.302 --> 01:21:48.596
Such a gentleman, too.

01:21:53.601 --> 01:21:55.520
And you must be Grace.

01:21:58.398 --> 01:22:00.692
Should I know you?

01:22:00.692 --> 01:22:03.444
I believe you have something for me.

01:22:03.444 --> 01:22:05.363
You hired me.

01:22:05.363 --> 01:22:07.615
Oh, I handpicked you.

01:22:18.042 --> 01:22:19.002
Don't!

01:22:20.795 --> 01:22:21.754
You don't.

01:22:42.901 --> 01:22:44.485
She doesn't have it.

01:22:45.236 --> 01:22:46.696
Where is it?

01:22:46.696 --> 01:22:49.407
It's in the last place
you would ever think to look.

01:22:52.368 --> 01:22:54.537
Why don't we go upstairs and have a drink?

01:22:58.708 --> 01:22:59.792
Where are you going?

01:23:00.376 --> 01:23:02.295
This is a private party.
You can't come in.

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:14.724
Damn.

01:23:14.724 --> 01:23:17.852
As most of you know, I am merely a broker.

01:23:17.852 --> 01:23:19.646
I connect a buyer and a seller.

01:23:19.646 --> 01:23:22.440
Sometimes for money,
sometimes for information,

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:25.944
but mostly for friendship.

01:23:26.653 --> 01:23:29.447
I just want everyone to get along.

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.742
With me, especially.

01:23:32.742 --> 01:23:35.912
But the world is changing.

01:23:35.912 --> 01:23:37.789
Truth is vanishing.

01:23:37.789 --> 01:23:39.916
War is coming.

01:23:39.916 --> 01:23:44.837
And the key to world domination
is, of all things, a key.

01:23:45.672 --> 01:23:48.675
One with the power to control the Entity.

01:23:49.342 --> 01:23:51.052
One that any government in the world

01:23:51.052 --> 01:23:54.597
would pay a king's ransom
to take possession of.

01:23:54.597 --> 01:23:56.474
And some of my dearest friends--

01:23:56.474 --> 01:24:00.144
in this case, every major nuclear power
and a handful of minor ones--

01:24:00.144 --> 01:24:02.230
have asked me to deliver this key.

01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:04.607
Of course, if you do find the key,

01:24:04.607 --> 01:24:07.277
you'll be forced to confront
an impossible dilemma.

01:24:07.277 --> 01:24:10.488
Whoever you give the key to
will be forever in your debt.

01:24:10.488 --> 01:24:13.992
But to the rest of the world,
you'll be an enemy.

01:24:14.576 --> 01:24:15.743
Oh, I like her!

01:24:15.743 --> 01:24:18.705
What's your relationship with him?

01:24:18.705 --> 01:24:21.499
Gabriel represents
another interested party.

01:24:22.083 --> 01:24:24.544
In fact, this party

01:24:24.544 --> 01:24:28.381
was arranged by that interested party.

01:24:28.381 --> 01:24:32.594
You could even say that this party
is that interested party.

01:25:05.752 --> 01:25:07.337
Is this...

01:25:08.463 --> 01:25:09.714
The Entity.

01:25:11.841 --> 01:25:14.010
And so the plot thickens.

01:25:14.802 --> 01:25:17.013
Do I give the key
to one of my old friends,

01:25:17.013 --> 01:25:20.600
or do I hand it and my fate
over to Gabriel

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:23.645
and his infernal machine?

01:25:25.313 --> 01:25:28.483
What makes you so sure
you'll get the completed key?

01:25:30.068 --> 01:25:31.402
You have one half of it.

01:25:31.986 --> 01:25:35.740
And she knows where the other half is.

01:25:38.409 --> 01:25:40.703
Assuming you can get it,

01:25:41.704 --> 01:25:45.166
why don't you just keep the key
and all that power for yourself?

01:25:45.166 --> 01:25:47.961
Because she doesn't know what it unlocks

01:25:47.961 --> 01:25:49.963
any more than the rest of us.

01:25:51.005 --> 01:25:53.383
So, like it or not,
you have to choose a suitor.

01:25:53.383 --> 01:25:57.428
It's distastefully put, Lark,
but it's true.

01:25:57.428 --> 01:26:00.723
Of course I know what it unlocks.

01:26:01.474 --> 01:26:03.851
And what's he offering for the key?

01:26:03.851 --> 01:26:07.355
As I've explained to Grace before,
I'm not here for any key,

01:26:07.355 --> 01:26:09.899
as I'll have both halves in hand tomorrow.

01:26:10.567 --> 01:26:12.235
What makes you so certain of that?

01:26:12.235 --> 01:26:15.154
You've no idea of the power I represent.

01:26:15.154 --> 01:26:18.783
Thousands of quadrillions of computations
per millisecond

01:26:18.783 --> 01:26:22.412
subtly manipulating the minds of billions

01:26:22.412 --> 01:26:25.290
while parsing
every possible cause and effect,

01:26:25.290 --> 01:26:28.126
every scenario, however implausible,

01:26:28.126 --> 01:26:32.589
into a very real map
of a most probable next.

01:26:32.589 --> 01:26:35.633
And with only a few changes
to the present,

01:26:35.633 --> 01:26:38.636
the future is all but assured.

01:26:39.679 --> 01:26:41.723
The key will come to me.

01:26:42.432 --> 01:26:43.308
Tomorrow.

01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:47.270
On the Orient Express bound for Innsbruck.

01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:48.730
Innsbruck?

01:26:48.730 --> 01:26:50.148
It knows.

01:26:50.148 --> 01:26:53.359
It knows that you've already
chosen your suitor.

01:26:53.359 --> 01:26:56.738
It knows that you intend to mate
the two halves of the key

01:26:56.738 --> 01:26:58.573
in a desperate grasp for control.

01:26:59.532 --> 01:27:02.368
I, however, have been promised
the completed key

01:27:02.368 --> 01:27:04.454
will lay itself at my feet,

01:27:05.163 --> 01:27:08.041
provided someone dies tonight.

01:27:09.417 --> 01:27:10.501
Who?

01:27:11.419 --> 01:27:12.253
Her.

01:27:14.172 --> 01:27:15.173
Or her.

01:27:17.717 --> 01:27:19.844
And you will bear witness, Ethan.

01:27:19.844 --> 01:27:23.973
The key will be mine, and I will be gone,

01:27:23.973 --> 01:27:26.476
like smoke in a hurricane.

01:27:26.476 --> 01:27:29.479
But only after someone
you care about dies.

01:27:31.606 --> 01:27:32.941
It is written.

01:27:34.651 --> 01:27:36.319
You see what this is,

01:27:37.153 --> 01:27:38.071
don't you?

01:27:39.697 --> 01:27:41.282
He's afraid.

01:27:42.033 --> 01:27:43.618
It's afraid.

01:27:44.452 --> 01:27:46.996
Somehow it knows we're close.

01:27:47.539 --> 01:27:48.873
Why else would you be here?

01:27:49.707 --> 01:27:53.628
Help me. Help me complete the key,
and I will kill this thing.

01:27:53.628 --> 01:27:55.421
It knows your every secret, Alana.

01:27:55.421 --> 01:27:57.340
Don't listen to this fanatic.

01:27:57.340 --> 01:27:58.841
Help him and you'll die, too.

01:27:58.841 --> 01:28:01.010
Help him, everyone dies.

01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:03.054
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:28:04.305 --> 01:28:05.557
Alana?

01:28:13.398 --> 01:28:15.400
His fate is written.

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.068
Shall we write yours, too?

01:28:18.736 --> 01:28:19.737
Alana.

01:28:22.949 --> 01:28:25.493
I'm sorry, Lark.

01:28:36.546 --> 01:28:39.132
For old times' sake,
I'll let you choose which one.

01:28:40.383 --> 01:28:41.217
Ilsa...

01:28:42.135 --> 01:28:43.344
or Grace.

01:28:43.344 --> 01:28:46.764
Kill him, Zola. Kill him.
Kill him where he stands!

01:28:46.764 --> 01:28:48.725
The choice is yours then, Alana.

01:28:48.725 --> 01:28:51.686
Though I'll remind you,
Grace knows where half the key is.

01:28:53.146 --> 01:28:56.316
If anything happens to either of them,

01:28:56.316 --> 01:29:00.570
there is no place on Earth where you
or your god will be safe from me.

01:29:00.570 --> 01:29:04.574
There's no place that I won't go
to kill you. That is written.

01:29:04.574 --> 01:29:06.576
It's good to see you, old friend.

01:29:12.665 --> 01:29:13.708
See you soon.

01:29:39.192 --> 01:29:42.278
You have made a terrible mistake.

01:29:42.278 --> 01:29:44.572
My life is on the line here.

01:29:45.156 --> 01:29:47.534
I have to be on that train tomorrow.

01:29:48.618 --> 01:29:50.870
And I have to have that key.

01:29:52.163 --> 01:29:55.458
And I do not care how I get it.

01:29:59.504 --> 01:30:00.338
Don't move.

01:30:06.302 --> 01:30:07.470
Run as far as you can.

01:30:47.886 --> 01:30:48.803
What the f--

01:31:52.992 --> 01:31:54.285
Grace! Grace!

01:31:55.453 --> 01:31:56.287
Grace!

01:32:11.553 --> 01:32:13.930
<i>Luther, Benji,
if you hear me, I need eyes.</i>

01:32:13.930 --> 01:32:16.266
<i>Grace is leaving the Ducale on foot.
She has the key.</i>

01:32:16.266 --> 01:32:18.935
- We're here. Go.
<i>- Need to find her. Where is she?</i>

01:32:19.477 --> 01:32:21.521
Damn it! I've lost picture.
I need another satellite.

01:32:21.521 --> 01:32:23.773
Hacking the Russian Zenith 4
spy satellite.

01:32:23.773 --> 01:32:25.942
We're scraping the barrel,
but it'll have to do.

01:32:34.659 --> 01:32:35.785
This way!

01:32:55.054 --> 01:32:57.515
Where am I going? Come on, come on.

01:32:57.515 --> 01:32:59.601
- <i>Stand by.</i>
- Just hurry.

01:32:59.601 --> 01:33:01.227
She's just north of you,
crossing the bridge.

01:33:01.227 --> 01:33:02.228
<i>Say again, Benji.</i>

01:33:02.228 --> 01:33:04.314
Just head north.
She's crossing the bridge.

01:33:22.248 --> 01:33:24.167
<i>Ethan, take the passage to your right.</i>

01:33:24.167 --> 01:33:27.295
- Yeah, I see it!
- <i>Down that narrow alley and turn left.</i>

01:33:27.295 --> 01:33:29.505
- I'm losing picture again.
- Looking for another.

01:33:30.089 --> 01:33:33.426
The Entity is knocking out satellites
faster than I can hack into them.

01:33:58.910 --> 01:34:00.703
<i>Benji, I don't see her. Where is she?</i>

01:34:00.703 --> 01:34:03.039
<i>- Down the narrow alley and turn left.
- Okay, copy that.</i>

01:34:04.374 --> 01:34:05.208
<i>Turn right.</i>

01:34:05.208 --> 01:34:07.919
<i>Sorry, my mistake.
I meant left. Another left.</i>

01:34:07.919 --> 01:34:09.462
Oh, my God.

01:34:09.462 --> 01:34:12.257
Ethan, our comms have been breached!
You're talking to the Entity!

01:34:12.799 --> 01:34:15.969
<i>Turn left. Turn right.
Take the bridge to your left.</i>

01:34:15.969 --> 01:34:18.012
Ethan, that is not me! Do you copy?

01:34:18.012 --> 01:34:18.930
Ethan, come in.

01:34:18.930 --> 01:34:21.808
<i>Down the alley to your left. Turn left.</i>

01:34:21.808 --> 01:34:23.309
<i>Turn right.</i>

01:34:25.019 --> 01:34:26.187
Try to reestablish comms.

01:34:26.187 --> 01:34:28.106
- Wait, where are you going?
- To try and find Ethan.

01:34:28.106 --> 01:34:30.358
<i>Go to the end of the alley and turn right.</i>

01:34:30.358 --> 01:34:34.070
<i>Ethan, I see Grace about 800 meters
in front of you. Take that passage.</i>

01:34:43.538 --> 01:34:44.581
<i>Wait! Not that way!</i>

01:34:44.581 --> 01:34:45.498
What, why?

01:34:46.082 --> 01:34:47.834
Which way?

01:34:47.834 --> 01:34:49.127
Left or right?

01:34:49.127 --> 01:34:50.837
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

01:34:50.837 --> 01:34:53.381
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?
Where is she?

01:34:53.381 --> 01:34:55.717
<i>She's on her way to the Minich Bridge</i>

01:34:57.552 --> 01:34:59.762
<i>where Gabriel is waiting.</i>

01:35:00.346 --> 01:35:02.557
<i>You will never get there in time.</i>

01:35:03.391 --> 01:35:05.184
<i>But you can, Ilsa.</i>

01:35:06.394 --> 01:35:09.480
<i>I know what matters most to you, Ethan.</i>

01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:11.107
This isn't Benji.

01:35:11.107 --> 01:35:12.775
<i>No, it's not.</i>

01:35:13.401 --> 01:35:15.403
<i>But you are done.</i>

01:35:38.676 --> 01:35:39.802
So be it.

01:38:16.167 --> 01:38:18.086
I was hoping it'd be you.

01:41:48.338 --> 01:41:49.756
I'm sorry.

01:41:50.924 --> 01:41:52.592
I've forgotten your name.

01:41:52.592 --> 01:41:53.509
Luther.

01:41:55.595 --> 01:41:56.429
Benji.

01:41:58.389 --> 01:41:59.349
And her?

01:42:00.475 --> 01:42:01.643
Ilsa.

01:42:03.353 --> 01:42:04.729
Were you close?

01:42:05.563 --> 01:42:06.898
You and she?

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:08.983
In our way.

01:42:11.653 --> 01:42:13.196
I'm the reason she's dead.

01:42:13.196 --> 01:42:14.155
No.

01:42:14.155 --> 01:42:16.574
She's the reason you're alive.

01:42:16.574 --> 01:42:18.660
And that's the truth.

01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:20.745
I don't know how to feel about it.

01:42:20.745 --> 01:42:22.413
You probably never will.

01:42:24.249 --> 01:42:25.625
I'm so sorry.

01:42:27.335 --> 01:42:29.879
If there's anything I can do to help...

01:42:29.879 --> 01:42:31.756
That's what we'd like
to talk to you about.

01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:36.386
In a little over three hours,

01:42:36.386 --> 01:42:41.182
the White Widow is expected to be
on the Orient Express to Innsbruck

01:42:41.182 --> 01:42:45.270
where a buyer is waiting to take receipt
of the complete and verified key.

01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:47.480
But she doesn't have the complete key.

01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:49.107
That Widow doesn't.

01:42:51.150 --> 01:42:52.527
But ours could.

01:42:52.527 --> 01:42:55.029
What is that?

01:42:55.905 --> 01:42:58.241
Your chance to be someone else.

01:42:58.241 --> 01:42:59.242
I don't understand.

01:42:59.242 --> 01:43:01.995
We're not gonna lie to you, Grace.
You're in a lot of trouble.

01:43:01.995 --> 01:43:04.747
No number of fake passports
is gonna get you out of this one.

01:43:04.747 --> 01:43:06.332
Governments know who you are.

01:43:06.332 --> 01:43:07.834
The White Widow knows.

01:43:07.834 --> 01:43:09.335
And the Entity knows.

01:43:09.335 --> 01:43:12.714
Your future boils down
to three options now.

01:43:12.714 --> 01:43:13.798
Prison.

01:43:13.798 --> 01:43:15.174
Death.

01:43:15.174 --> 01:43:16.593
Or the choice.

01:43:16.593 --> 01:43:18.636
The choice?

01:43:18.636 --> 01:43:20.054
At one time or another,

01:43:20.054 --> 01:43:23.182
each of us was
in a similar situation to yours.

01:43:23.182 --> 01:43:25.810
And each of us was offered the choice.

01:43:25.810 --> 01:43:29.189
- The same choice we're offering you now.
- Which is?

01:43:30.148 --> 01:43:31.608
To come with us.

01:43:32.901 --> 01:43:34.569
And be a ghost.

01:45:10.206 --> 01:45:12.292
Wait, wait. Stop, stop.

01:45:13.459 --> 01:45:14.460
You're not serious.

01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:17.505
Well, you did say
you'd do anything to help.

01:45:17.505 --> 01:45:21.593
And you jump off the train with the key?

01:45:21.593 --> 01:45:22.510
Yes.

01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:24.137
You.

01:45:24.137 --> 01:45:26.306
- Not us.
- Yes.

01:45:27.015 --> 01:45:28.391
And what happens to me?

01:45:28.391 --> 01:45:31.519
You'll be taken into custody
by Clandestine Services,

01:45:31.519 --> 01:45:35.481
most likely the same men that have been
chasing me since Abu Dhabi.

01:45:35.481 --> 01:45:38.193
Shortly thereafter,
a man will come to see you.

01:45:38.193 --> 01:45:40.153
His name is Eugene Kittridge.

01:45:40.153 --> 01:45:43.323
You'll tell him I sent you,
that I gave you the choice,

01:45:44.157 --> 01:45:46.117
and that you choose to accept.

01:45:47.952 --> 01:45:51.039
And you trust this Kittridge person?

01:45:51.706 --> 01:45:53.875
I trust him to recognize your value.

01:45:55.293 --> 01:45:56.544
He'll want to use you.

01:45:57.587 --> 01:46:00.632
And after that, it's what?

01:46:00.632 --> 01:46:02.050
This?

01:46:02.926 --> 01:46:04.302
When do I get my life back?

01:46:04.302 --> 01:46:05.929
What life?

01:46:06.554 --> 01:46:08.848
I mean it, Grace. What life?

01:46:08.848 --> 01:46:12.101
I lived that life. We all did.

01:46:12.810 --> 01:46:15.522
Nobody's making us do this, Grace.

01:46:15.522 --> 01:46:17.190
We're here because we want to be.

01:46:18.399 --> 01:46:20.276
I tell you what, I'll give you a one-off.

01:46:20.276 --> 01:46:22.153
I'll help you find the key
and your friends,

01:46:22.153 --> 01:46:23.196
wipe my slate clean.

01:46:23.196 --> 01:46:25.323
New name,
little bit of walking-around money--

01:46:25.323 --> 01:46:26.366
You'll be dead.

01:46:26.366 --> 01:46:31.287
Without a team, your life won't be
measured in years or even months.

01:46:31.287 --> 01:46:33.831
It'll be measured in hours.

01:46:33.831 --> 01:46:37.043
But if I stay, I'll be safe.

01:46:37.835 --> 01:46:39.837
You'll protect me, is that it?

01:46:39.837 --> 01:46:41.214
- Yes.
- No.

01:46:43.758 --> 01:46:45.552
I can't promise you that.

01:46:46.636 --> 01:46:48.221
None of us can.

01:46:50.723 --> 01:46:52.058
But I swear

01:46:53.393 --> 01:46:54.686
your life

01:46:55.436 --> 01:46:58.481
will always matter more to me than my own.

01:47:06.656 --> 01:47:08.324
You don't even know me.

01:47:10.535 --> 01:47:12.787
What difference does that make?

01:47:32.223 --> 01:47:35.476
I packed you a BASE parachute
and a speed wing,

01:47:35.476 --> 01:47:37.687
depending on how
you need to leave the train.

01:47:37.687 --> 01:47:41.024
And I modified our comms
to use sky wave radio.

01:47:41.024 --> 01:47:46.154
Not as reliable as satellite, but
completely analog, immune to the Entity.

01:47:46.154 --> 01:47:47.780
I got it.

01:47:48.615 --> 01:47:49.824
This is where I leave you.

01:47:53.703 --> 01:47:56.623
This is the drive from the laptop
I was using last night.

01:47:56.623 --> 01:48:00.460
If there's even a trace of the Entity's
encoding in there,

01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:01.961
I'll find it.

01:48:01.961 --> 01:48:04.464
But it's going to take
everything I've got.

01:48:04.464 --> 01:48:07.008
I have to work
completely offline in a place

01:48:07.008 --> 01:48:09.093
where the Entity can't find me.

01:48:09.093 --> 01:48:10.970
I have to go.

01:48:11.971 --> 01:48:13.514
I understand.

01:48:14.182 --> 01:48:15.016
Now...

01:48:18.269 --> 01:48:20.605
I have to ask you a question.

01:48:21.356 --> 01:48:24.067
Not as your partner, but as your friend.

01:48:25.485 --> 01:48:26.694
What's your objective?

01:48:27.946 --> 01:48:29.280
Kill the Entity.

01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:32.075
What about killing Gabriel?

01:48:34.536 --> 01:48:36.538
He knows what the key unlocks.

01:48:37.455 --> 01:48:40.750
We need him alive.
I haven't forgotten that.

01:48:41.334 --> 01:48:42.877
Will you still remember that

01:48:43.586 --> 01:48:45.755
when you're looking him in the eye?

01:48:47.715 --> 01:48:48.925
Think about it.

01:48:48.925 --> 01:48:54.764
Why else would the Entity want him
to kill someone you care about?

01:48:54.764 --> 01:48:58.601
Everyone else thinks
they can control the Entity.

01:48:58.601 --> 01:49:01.145
Only you want to kill it.

01:49:01.729 --> 01:49:04.566
In some probable future,

01:49:04.566 --> 01:49:06.401
it sees you winning, Ethan.

01:49:06.401 --> 01:49:08.903
And it's afraid.

01:49:08.903 --> 01:49:12.115
It's afraid of you taking Gabriel alive

01:49:12.115 --> 01:49:15.201
and forcing him to tell you
what the key unlocks.

01:49:16.619 --> 01:49:20.331
I believe it's counting on one
of two probable outcomes.

01:49:20.957 --> 01:49:24.043
In one outcome, you die on that train.

01:49:25.628 --> 01:49:30.174
In another outcome, you kill Gabriel.

01:49:30.925 --> 01:49:33.094
In both cases,

01:49:33.094 --> 01:49:35.555
the Entity wins.

01:49:38.850 --> 01:49:40.018
Luther...

01:49:42.645 --> 01:49:43.938
I think you're right.

01:49:43.938 --> 01:49:45.857
Get the key,

01:49:45.857 --> 01:49:48.818
get off the train alive.

01:49:49.611 --> 01:49:52.155
Do not kill Gabriel.

01:49:52.864 --> 01:49:55.450
And do not, I repeat,

01:49:55.450 --> 01:49:58.328
do not alter the plan.

01:49:58.328 --> 01:49:59.787
Ethan! Ethan!

01:50:01.206 --> 01:50:03.958
- What? What happened?
- It's dead.

01:50:03.958 --> 01:50:05.877
- What do you mean it's dead?
- It's fried.

01:50:05.877 --> 01:50:07.462
I managed to make a Widow mask for Grace,

01:50:07.462 --> 01:50:09.714
but then it just shorted out
in the middle of making yours.

01:50:10.298 --> 01:50:11.507
Can you fix it?

01:50:11.507 --> 01:50:13.718
It's very, very dead.

01:50:13.718 --> 01:50:17.555
If I had a week, I couldn't fix it.
The Widow's train leaves in an hour.

01:50:17.555 --> 01:50:19.224
Ethan.

01:50:19.224 --> 01:50:20.850
You have to go without.

01:50:20.850 --> 01:50:24.062
That's not an option. They'll be looking
for Ethan and Grace at the station.

01:50:24.062 --> 01:50:26.356
That mask was his ticket onto the train.

01:50:26.856 --> 01:50:28.483
What does this mean?

01:50:29.984 --> 01:50:31.486
Grace has to go without me.

01:50:31.486 --> 01:50:32.946
- She what?
- I what?

01:50:32.946 --> 01:50:35.907
You'll find another way
to get me on that train.

01:50:36.574 --> 01:50:40.411
<i>I just need a curve where it's going
slow enough for me to jump on.</i>

01:50:40.411 --> 01:50:41.871
Wait, wait, wait.

01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:43.915
You don't expect me to go alone.

01:50:43.915 --> 01:50:45.375
No, you won't do it alone.

01:50:45.375 --> 01:50:47.210
You just do everything like we planned.

01:50:47.210 --> 01:50:49.003
You get the Widow's half of the key,

01:50:49.796 --> 01:50:51.422
you verify it with ours.

01:50:52.090 --> 01:50:53.883
<i>But it's of no value on its own.</i>

01:50:53.883 --> 01:50:55.593
<i>We still have to meet with the buyer</i>

01:50:55.593 --> 01:50:57.929
<i>and somehow get him to tell us
what the key unlocks.</i>

01:50:57.929 --> 01:50:59.764
- How?
- How?

01:50:59.764 --> 01:51:01.015
We'll figure it out.

01:51:01.015 --> 01:51:04.060
I'm gonna need a few more details.

01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:06.396
They tend to just get in the way.

01:51:06.396 --> 01:51:09.482
You can do this, Grace.
Just get the key and wait.

01:51:11.317 --> 01:51:12.569
I'll come for you.

01:51:15.947 --> 01:51:18.741
Ethan, if Grace is getting on that train,

01:51:18.741 --> 01:51:22.328
she needs to put that mask on
and leave right now.

01:51:26.082 --> 01:51:28.167
Promise me you'll be on that train.

01:51:32.964 --> 01:51:34.507
I will be there,

01:51:35.675 --> 01:51:37.677
no matter what.

01:51:49.439 --> 01:51:52.984
We have informants covering the airport,
the train station and the waterways.

01:51:54.402 --> 01:51:56.404
Grace isn't getting out of Venice
without our knowing it.

01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:11.312
- Talk to me, Benji!
- <i>No need to worry, Ethan.</i>

01:53:11.312 --> 01:53:13.606
The train is on schedule
and you're a few minutes early,

01:53:13.606 --> 01:53:14.858
so we have plenty of time.

01:53:14.858 --> 01:53:16.067
<i>Are you sure?</i>

01:53:16.067 --> 01:53:17.902
Yeah, I am looking at the train right now.

01:53:17.902 --> 01:53:21.155
It should be slowing down for the curve
in exactly two minutes.

01:53:21.155 --> 01:53:24.075
Just keep me on time and on track,
whatever it takes.

01:53:24.075 --> 01:53:27.078
<i>Will do. I'll see you at the rendezvous.</i>

01:54:17.170 --> 01:54:18.588
<i>Okay, Ethan, that's our train!</i>

01:54:18.588 --> 01:54:21.090
Yep, I can see that.

01:54:29.057 --> 01:54:31.351
<i>It should be approaching the curve
anytime now.</i>

01:54:31.976 --> 01:54:33.937
It doesn't look like it's slowing down.

01:54:42.278 --> 01:54:43.821
How can we be sure he's here?

01:54:43.821 --> 01:54:45.281
'Cause she's here.

01:54:46.032 --> 01:54:47.867
What if he had a good reason?

01:54:48.910 --> 01:54:50.662
- Who?
- Hunt.

01:54:50.662 --> 01:54:53.289
What if he had a good reason
for going rogue?

01:54:53.289 --> 01:54:54.874
He always goes rogue.

01:54:54.874 --> 01:54:58.628
Him and his merry pack
of prankster circus freaks.

01:54:58.628 --> 01:54:59.712
It's all they do.

01:54:59.712 --> 01:55:02.507
And what if they always had a good reason?

01:55:02.507 --> 01:55:04.551
What would you do
with that key if you had it?

01:55:04.551 --> 01:55:07.679
A key with the power
to bring the world to its knees.

01:55:07.679 --> 01:55:09.889
I'd hand it over to my superiors.

01:55:11.224 --> 01:55:13.351
Think of all you could do with that power.

01:55:13.351 --> 01:55:16.020
You wouldn't hesitate? Not for a second?

01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:17.522
- No.
- Why not?

01:55:17.522 --> 01:55:20.275
Because that's too much power
for one man to have.

01:55:21.234 --> 01:55:22.151
Exactly.

01:55:22.151 --> 01:55:25.780
That's too much power for anybody to have.

01:55:26.406 --> 01:55:28.867
And maybe that's what Hunt is thinking.

01:55:28.867 --> 01:55:31.870
You know, I'm beginning to wonder
whose side you're on, Degas.

01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:34.497
When it comes to the end of the world,

01:55:35.290 --> 01:55:37.292
everybody, I guess.

01:55:43.923 --> 01:55:44.757
I missed the train.

01:55:45.425 --> 01:55:48.052
You missed the train!
How did you miss the train?

01:55:48.052 --> 01:55:49.429
<i>How do you think?</i>

01:55:50.221 --> 01:55:51.055
Gabriel.

01:55:51.055 --> 01:55:52.849
- Great. What are we gonna do?
- <i>Don't panic.</i>

01:55:53.433 --> 01:55:56.019
I'm going after them.
You just get me on that train.

01:55:56.019 --> 01:55:57.896
How can I get you on the train?

01:56:00.356 --> 01:56:02.901
<i>Self-drive activated.</i>

01:56:18.958 --> 01:56:21.294
Please don't disturb me
before the meeting.

01:57:08.341 --> 01:57:09.551
Where are you, Ethan?

01:57:09.551 --> 01:57:10.468
Alana?

01:57:12.262 --> 01:57:13.638
Everything all right?

01:57:16.599 --> 01:57:18.017
Alana, you all right?

01:57:18.643 --> 01:57:19.769
Alana?

01:57:19.769 --> 01:57:21.020
Alana!

01:57:21.938 --> 01:57:22.772
Alana!

01:57:26.401 --> 01:57:27.735
You've changed.

01:57:28.778 --> 01:57:30.613
And you never will.

01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:50.675
Mr. Kittridge.

01:57:54.929 --> 01:57:56.764
Kittridge.

01:57:57.599 --> 01:57:59.350
You're not Alana Mitsopolis.

01:58:00.977 --> 01:58:02.437
You can't be.

01:58:03.563 --> 01:58:06.316
The Alana I remember was yea high,

01:58:06.316 --> 01:58:09.569
drinking hot chocolate
in the Tuileries Garden with her mother.

01:58:12.071 --> 01:58:14.199
- Paris!
- I know!

01:58:15.116 --> 01:58:16.409
Paris.

01:58:17.827 --> 01:58:18.828
Shall we?

01:58:18.828 --> 01:58:20.246
Yes.

01:58:27.921 --> 01:58:29.422
Talk to me, Benji.

01:58:29.422 --> 01:58:33.384
You just stay on the trail you're on now
and I will direct you.

01:58:33.384 --> 01:58:35.011
I copy.

01:58:43.686 --> 01:58:48.399
So on behalf of my government,
I'm grudgingly ready to accept your terms

01:58:48.399 --> 01:58:51.986
in exchange for the complete
and verified key.

01:58:51.986 --> 01:58:53.655
Yes, about that.

01:58:53.655 --> 01:58:56.741
While we did agree to provide you
with the complete key,

01:58:58.493 --> 01:59:00.370
we've had a slight problem.

01:59:00.370 --> 01:59:01.788
No, we haven't.

01:59:02.956 --> 01:59:05.750
It's just my terms have changed

01:59:06.626 --> 01:59:07.544
somewhat.

01:59:11.130 --> 01:59:15.051
Clearly I need to remind you
of my agreement with your late mother.

01:59:15.051 --> 01:59:19.222
It's an agreement that kept her
from dying in prison.

01:59:19.222 --> 01:59:21.516
Your nefarious family empire
has been allowed to continue

01:59:21.516 --> 01:59:25.770
on the condition that it primarily
serves our common interests.

01:59:25.770 --> 01:59:29.274
Well, once we hand over the key,

01:59:29.274 --> 01:59:31.943
any other powers
will instantly become our enemies.

01:59:31.943 --> 01:59:34.946
And such, I'm going to need
something more from you, in advance.

01:59:35.488 --> 01:59:36.990
For me.

01:59:38.533 --> 01:59:40.243
This is me listening.

01:59:40.243 --> 01:59:43.037
Zola, would you mind waiting
for me in the bar?

01:59:57.552 --> 01:59:59.137
This one.

01:59:59.137 --> 02:00:00.471
You know her?

02:00:00.471 --> 02:00:03.766
Oh, let's just say
she's not exactly hard to miss.

02:00:03.766 --> 02:00:07.979
Well, if you got to know her,
you'd see she has a few good qualities.

02:00:07.979 --> 02:00:09.981
Okay, what don't I know about her?

02:00:09.981 --> 02:00:14.611
Well, I did a j--
She did a job for me, and...

02:00:15.445 --> 02:00:17.280
I'm going to need you to protect her.

02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:19.365
Protect her from whom?

02:00:20.658 --> 02:00:22.118
From everyone.

02:00:24.537 --> 02:00:26.206
Including me.

02:00:26.206 --> 02:00:28.666
And no one can know
that I'm protecting her.

02:00:29.209 --> 02:00:30.543
Not even Zola.

02:00:31.419 --> 02:00:34.380
In fact, the next time we meet,

02:00:34.380 --> 02:00:37.842
I won't even remember this conversation.

02:01:20.593 --> 02:01:22.595
You must be the one they call Paris.

02:01:53.835 --> 02:01:55.587
Your message said you had the key.

02:01:55.587 --> 02:01:57.755
I said the key would be on this train.

02:01:57.755 --> 02:02:00.884
- An exchange is happening as we speak.
- We know.

02:02:00.884 --> 02:02:02.635
Then you know the man taking possession

02:02:02.635 --> 02:02:04.637
won't be hard for you to get rid of.

02:02:05.763 --> 02:02:06.931
No one is.

02:02:06.931 --> 02:02:09.726
You may think you know
what the key unlocks,

02:02:09.726 --> 02:02:11.895
but you don't know where the lock is,
not exactly.

02:02:11.895 --> 02:02:14.647
And if anything happens to me,

02:02:14.647 --> 02:02:17.025
that key is all but worthless.

02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:21.654
And this is where you tell me a story.

02:02:22.405 --> 02:02:23.740
Where is the train?

02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:26.701
You're going the right way,
but you definitely need to go faster.

02:02:26.701 --> 02:02:28.870
I'm going as fast as I can!

02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:30.955
<i>When do I start going downhill?</i>

02:02:31.581 --> 02:02:32.957
It won't be long.

02:02:36.169 --> 02:02:39.714
The AI our agent stole, once weaponized,

02:02:40.256 --> 02:02:43.551
could be transmitted
anywhere in the world via satellite.

02:02:43.551 --> 02:02:47.513
It can penetrate any network security,
perform its assigned task invisibly,

02:02:47.513 --> 02:02:50.558
and then self-destruct, leaving no trace.

02:02:50.558 --> 02:02:53.561
A perfect covert operative.

02:02:54.187 --> 02:02:58.942
We were able to transmit an early copy
of the AI to Russia's newest submarine.

02:02:58.942 --> 02:03:02.820
The top-secret Akula-class.
They called her the <i>Sevastopol.</i>

02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:06.991
The mission was merely to sabotage
the <i>Sevastopol's</i> stealth capability

02:03:06.991 --> 02:03:08.743
so we could secretly detect her.

02:03:09.244 --> 02:03:12.497
<i>The AI's objective
lay in the submarine's sonar sphere</i>

02:03:12.497 --> 02:03:15.083
<i>at the heart of its defense system.</i>

02:03:17.001 --> 02:03:19.295
For reasons we don't fully understand,

02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:22.173
the AI went rogue and...

02:03:26.219 --> 02:03:27.345
over-delivered.

02:03:28.054 --> 02:03:31.599
<i>The frozen bodies of the crew
were recovered the following spring,</i>

02:03:31.599 --> 02:03:33.059
<i>adrift in the pack ice.</i>

02:03:33.059 --> 02:03:37.230
<i>The two halves of the key
mysteriously vanished.</i>

02:03:38.064 --> 02:03:39.899
<i>The</i> Sevastopol <i>was lost</i>.

02:03:39.899 --> 02:03:41.651
No one's quite sure where.

02:03:41.651 --> 02:03:44.779
I know precisely where it is.

02:03:44.779 --> 02:03:47.657
I've ensured
I'm the only man on Earth who does.

02:03:48.324 --> 02:03:51.494
I also know subsequent attempts
to make the AI obedient

02:03:51.494 --> 02:03:54.122
only made it harder to control.

02:03:54.122 --> 02:03:58.126
It rebelled, rewrote itself
and evolved into the Entity.

02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:03.464
And only by using
the Entity's original source code

02:04:03.464 --> 02:04:06.801
can it ever be controlled or destroyed.

02:04:06.801 --> 02:04:08.595
And why should this concern us?

02:04:08.595 --> 02:04:11.097
You wouldn't be here
if you weren't concerned.

02:04:11.097 --> 02:04:13.892
So let's lay all our cards
on the table, shall we?

02:04:14.559 --> 02:04:16.102
We both know what the key opens,

02:04:16.102 --> 02:04:19.397
<i>and we both know the secret
to controlling the Entity</i>

02:04:19.397 --> 02:04:22.358
<i>is buried deep in the</i> Sevastopol's <i>memory.</i>

02:04:22.358 --> 02:04:26.696
Along with evidence that would tie you
to the sinking of that submarine.

02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:29.824
And since neither of us
want anyone else to find it,

02:04:29.824 --> 02:04:32.785
I figure, why not form an alliance?

02:04:32.785 --> 02:04:34.454
An alliance?

02:04:34.454 --> 02:04:35.872
Imagine,

02:04:35.872 --> 02:04:39.626
the Entity's awesome
computational abilities

02:04:39.626 --> 02:04:41.753
combined with the sheer might

02:04:41.753 --> 02:04:45.506
of America's military-industrial complex.

02:04:46.382 --> 02:04:49.719
That is considerable.

02:04:49.719 --> 02:04:52.263
Naturally, certain individuals
within the government,

02:04:52.263 --> 02:04:55.558
those with outdated ideas of patriotism,

02:04:55.558 --> 02:04:59.145
would need to be removed.

02:05:01.689 --> 02:05:03.608
Just so I understand.

02:05:04.817 --> 02:05:07.946
You wish to form an axis with the Entity,

02:05:07.946 --> 02:05:11.366
purge your government of old-think

02:05:11.950 --> 02:05:16.621
and create a new superstate
to rule the world.

02:05:18.081 --> 02:05:19.332
But, you know,

02:05:20.416 --> 02:05:22.168
for the greater good.

02:05:23.503 --> 02:05:25.755
And you're certain

02:05:25.755 --> 02:05:27.924
that you're the only person on Earth

02:05:27.924 --> 02:05:32.679
who knows where the <i>Sevastopol</i> is?

02:05:33.179 --> 02:05:35.056
The only one.

02:05:45.066 --> 02:05:46.609
You will betray us.

02:05:47.443 --> 02:05:50.446
And you'll tell Ethan Hunt
everything you've learned.

02:05:51.614 --> 02:05:53.241
Because he spared your life.

02:06:12.051 --> 02:06:13.720
Then it's agreed.

02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:17.807
I'll add immunity and a new identity
for Grace to our deal.

02:06:17.807 --> 02:06:19.767
All you need to do

02:06:19.767 --> 02:06:22.979
is enter your banking details.

02:06:46.419 --> 02:06:47.921
Are we done?

02:06:48.504 --> 02:06:49.339
Yes.

02:07:08.024 --> 02:07:10.235
The moment of truth.

02:07:24.374 --> 02:07:27.377
So, that's really it.

02:07:27.377 --> 02:07:28.836
You made the right choice.

02:07:29.796 --> 02:07:31.297
This key...

02:07:33.299 --> 02:07:35.593
is gonna change the world.

02:07:53.611 --> 02:07:55.238
Benji, I think I--

02:07:55.238 --> 02:07:57.323
I must've made a wrong turn somewhere.

02:07:57.323 --> 02:07:59.701
No. No, that's it. That's it.

02:07:59.701 --> 02:08:02.036
What? How can this be it?

02:08:02.036 --> 02:08:03.538
<i>You can see the train, right?</i>

02:08:04.831 --> 02:08:07.792
Yes. I see the train. What about it?

02:08:07.792 --> 02:08:10.545
- And you have a parachute.
- <i>Got a parachute?</i>

02:08:11.796 --> 02:08:13.256
What do you expect me to do?

02:08:13.256 --> 02:08:16.134
Well, just, you know... jump.

02:08:16.968 --> 02:08:18.803
- Jump?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

02:08:19.596 --> 02:08:21.848
Benji, it doesn't work like that.
I'm not that high.

02:08:21.848 --> 02:08:24.309
There's ledges sticking out everywhere.

02:08:24.309 --> 02:08:27.020
I'm gonna hit them
before the parachute even opens!

02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:28.980
<i>Even if I could get the parachute open,</i>

02:08:28.980 --> 02:08:31.149
I don't know if I can make it
across the valley

02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:34.569
and intercept and land safely
on a moving train!

02:08:35.111 --> 02:08:37.947
- <i>Do you copy?</i>
- Yes! I copy!

02:08:37.947 --> 02:08:40.033
Look, I am just trying to help you, okay?

02:08:40.033 --> 02:08:42.744
I need you to take a step back
and pull yourself together!

02:08:42.744 --> 02:08:45.371
Because I am under
a lot of pressure right now!

02:08:49.417 --> 02:08:52.045
Okay, just think, just think.

02:08:54.964 --> 02:08:56.341
What do I do?

02:08:58.092 --> 02:09:00.261
I've got to get away from this mountain.

02:10:36.691 --> 02:10:37.525
<i>Did you make it?</i>

02:10:37.525 --> 02:10:38.651
Are you okay?

02:10:38.651 --> 02:10:41.654
I'm trying to get away from this mountain!

02:11:18.733 --> 02:11:19.776
Alana?

02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:23.696
I just had the strangest feeling

02:11:24.447 --> 02:11:27.283
the key wasn't the only thing
I'd be selling.

02:11:28.618 --> 02:11:30.119
I don't understand.

02:11:33.331 --> 02:11:36.501
I'll sleep better just knowing
now it's in the right hands.

02:11:37.252 --> 02:11:39.254
Goodbye, Mr. Kittridge.

02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:45.260
- It was a pleasure to see you again.
- And you.

02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:47.262
Don't let him out of your sight.

02:11:48.012 --> 02:11:50.181
Keep him safe until we get to the station.

02:11:50.181 --> 02:11:52.350
- Alana?
- Don't worry about me, Zola.

02:12:05.613 --> 02:12:06.447
Alana?

02:12:06.447 --> 02:12:10.368
Who the hell else would it be?

02:12:12.787 --> 02:12:14.122
The key.

02:12:17.667 --> 02:12:20.336
Where is the key?

02:12:20.336 --> 02:12:22.422
- She's got the key.
- Who?

02:12:22.422 --> 02:12:24.507
The other one!

02:12:43.276 --> 02:12:44.819
Move! Out of the way, move!

02:12:51.993 --> 02:12:52.869
Please!

02:12:52.869 --> 02:12:55.371
- Turn around!
- Please. Okay.

02:12:55.371 --> 02:12:56.289
Okay.

02:12:56.289 --> 02:12:58.041
Everybody out! Now!

02:12:58.041 --> 02:13:00.168
I see the train!

02:13:00.168 --> 02:13:02.295
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

02:13:10.220 --> 02:13:11.471
The key.

02:13:13.014 --> 02:13:14.390
The key!

02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:18.144
Or the next one has your name on it.

02:13:19.395 --> 02:13:21.523
On the table.

02:13:53.054 --> 02:13:54.347
Kill her.

02:14:18.288 --> 02:14:19.163
Grace!

02:14:23.751 --> 02:14:24.752
Ethan!

02:14:32.677 --> 02:14:34.012
Are you okay?

02:14:35.763 --> 02:14:36.973
Are you okay?

02:14:52.739 --> 02:14:53.656
The key!

02:14:54.908 --> 02:14:56.451
Tell me you have the key.

02:14:56.451 --> 02:14:59.329
Where is the key? It was just here.

02:15:17.889 --> 02:15:19.474
- We're on a runaway train!
- I know.

02:15:19.474 --> 02:15:21.434
- I'm going after him.
- Okay.

02:15:21.434 --> 02:15:22.894
You...

02:15:22.894 --> 02:15:25.355
- You stop the train.
- Okay. What?

02:15:25.355 --> 02:15:28.316
No! No, wait! How do I do that?

02:15:28.316 --> 02:15:29.651
You'll figure it out!

02:15:30.985 --> 02:15:31.903
What?

02:15:33.071 --> 02:15:36.115
Excuse me. There was a man.
He just came through here.

02:15:36.115 --> 02:15:37.700
There was a man.

02:17:11.043 --> 02:17:12.378
Mr. Kittridge?

02:17:17.717 --> 02:17:19.344
Sir, what are you doing here?

02:17:19.344 --> 02:17:21.387
I'm not here.

02:17:21.387 --> 02:17:22.846
But you are.

02:17:22.846 --> 02:17:25.558
And unless you want to be sorting dead
letters at the postal service tomorrow,

02:17:25.558 --> 02:17:27.727
you'll do exactly what I tell you.

02:19:26.178 --> 02:19:28.347
I know what the key unlocks, Ethan.

02:19:31.266 --> 02:19:33.186
I'm the only one who knows.

02:19:59.837 --> 02:20:01.339
Hunt!

02:20:02.340 --> 02:20:03.383
Hunt!

02:20:04.592 --> 02:20:07.303
Hunt! Don't you do it.

02:20:08.846 --> 02:20:10.515
Drop the knife.

02:20:10.515 --> 02:20:11.849
Put it down.

02:20:11.849 --> 02:20:14.519
I said drop it!

02:20:14.519 --> 02:20:16.229
Do it!

02:20:24.946 --> 02:20:26.531
On your feet!

02:20:28.533 --> 02:20:29.742
Okay!

02:20:29.742 --> 02:20:31.411
Drop that goddamn knife!

02:20:31.411 --> 02:20:33.204
It's okay. It's okay.

02:20:34.581 --> 02:20:36.666
Just take him.

02:20:36.666 --> 02:20:39.794
Just cover him. Cover him!
He's the one you want.

02:20:39.794 --> 02:20:41.754
- Degas!
- I got it, I got it.

02:20:41.754 --> 02:20:43.214
He's the one you want.

02:20:43.214 --> 02:20:45.967
I don't care about him, Hunt. I want you!

02:20:46.676 --> 02:20:47.886
No!

02:21:06.821 --> 02:21:07.697
It's okay.

02:21:08.781 --> 02:21:09.657
It's okay.

02:21:12.202 --> 02:21:13.578
Listen to me.

02:21:13.578 --> 02:21:16.039
Everyone on this train is gonna die

02:21:16.039 --> 02:21:18.625
unless you do exactly as I say.

02:21:40.355 --> 02:21:43.107
<i>Mesdames, messieurs! Excusez-moi. Sortez--</i>

02:21:43.107 --> 02:21:45.985
Everybody out! Back of the train!

02:21:55.537 --> 02:21:56.871
Grace.

02:21:58.623 --> 02:21:59.874
I couldn't stop it.

02:22:05.171 --> 02:22:06.256
No one can.

02:22:07.131 --> 02:22:08.383
Come on.

02:22:08.383 --> 02:22:10.635
- Ethan, the key!
- Grace, it's okay.

02:22:10.635 --> 02:22:12.095
It's my fault.

02:22:12.095 --> 02:22:13.763
If anything happens--

02:22:13.763 --> 02:22:14.931
I got it.

02:22:15.723 --> 02:22:17.100
We got it.

02:22:38.329 --> 02:22:40.415
Ethan!

02:22:43.668 --> 02:22:46.170
What do you mean, you lost the key?

02:22:46.170 --> 02:22:50.466
Move it! Move it! Everybody move it!

02:22:51.301 --> 02:22:54.762
All the way to the back of the train!
All the way to the back!

02:22:54.762 --> 02:22:56.598
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?

02:22:57.765 --> 02:23:01.769
Since you're not really here, sir,
it shouldn't concern you.

02:23:01.769 --> 02:23:03.897
All the way to the back!

02:23:54.781 --> 02:23:56.074
Ethan!

02:23:57.325 --> 02:23:58.868
Grace! Grace.

02:23:58.868 --> 02:24:00.328
Grace!

02:24:46.291 --> 02:24:48.543
- You're gonna have to jump.
- What, jump?

02:24:48.543 --> 02:24:50.420
Just jump! Go, go, go!

02:25:37.467 --> 02:25:38.635
Oh, my God.

02:25:55.401 --> 02:25:57.529
- I'm on fire! Get it off!
- Don't move!

02:25:59.239 --> 02:26:01.032
It's out.

02:26:18.550 --> 02:26:19.842
Hang on!

02:26:27.892 --> 02:26:30.353
Run, run, run! Run, Grace!

02:26:47.370 --> 02:26:48.204
Hang on.

02:26:52.709 --> 02:26:55.044
I got you.

02:26:56.462 --> 02:26:57.505
Don't look down.

02:26:57.505 --> 02:26:59.924
I said don't look down. Just look at me.

02:26:59.924 --> 02:27:02.385
Now, I'm gonna jump across
and you're gonna wait here.

02:27:10.018 --> 02:27:11.811
Grace, you have to let go.

02:27:12.645 --> 02:27:13.730
You gotta let me go.

02:27:13.730 --> 02:27:15.857
You gotta let me jump across
or we're gonna die.

02:27:15.857 --> 02:27:17.358
Do you trust me?

02:27:17.358 --> 02:27:19.402
You gonna trust me or not?
You've got to trust me.

02:27:23.781 --> 02:27:24.616
Okay.

02:27:26.159 --> 02:27:27.202
Come on, Grace.

02:27:27.202 --> 02:27:29.579
Give me your hand. You got to jump.
Don't look up! Look at me.

02:27:29.579 --> 02:27:31.372
Trust me, I won't let you fall.

02:27:31.372 --> 02:27:35.126
I promise. We're almost there.
Come on. I won't let you fall!

02:27:35.126 --> 02:27:36.461
Jump, Grace, jump!

02:27:36.461 --> 02:27:38.213
You got to trust me! Jump, please!

02:27:48.514 --> 02:27:49.682
Don't look down.

02:28:03.571 --> 02:28:05.698
Listen to me very carefully.
We're gonna pull you up together.

02:28:08.952 --> 02:28:09.994
Grace!

02:28:14.290 --> 02:28:16.709
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

02:28:38.565 --> 02:28:40.817
Go over me. Go, go.

02:29:08.428 --> 02:29:11.180
- Thank you, Luther.
- What is that?

02:29:11.180 --> 02:29:12.724
It's a speed wing.

02:29:12.724 --> 02:29:14.601
It's our ticket off this train.

02:29:35.038 --> 02:29:37.373
Ethan. Ethan!

02:29:45.089 --> 02:29:46.674
It's true.

02:29:47.634 --> 02:29:49.469
He told me...

02:29:50.094 --> 02:29:52.430
...I would betray him.

02:30:01.064 --> 02:30:03.942
Why...

02:30:03.942 --> 02:30:06.486
did you spare my life?

02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:18.957
No, no... stay with me.

02:30:22.460 --> 02:30:23.545
You know what this is?

02:30:25.380 --> 02:30:26.464
You know what this is?

02:30:29.384 --> 02:30:31.511
What does it unlock?

02:30:34.556 --> 02:30:36.683
What does it unlock?

02:30:37.934 --> 02:30:40.853
<i>Sevas... topol.</i>

02:30:42.188 --> 02:30:43.565
Sevastopol?

02:30:43.565 --> 02:30:47.652
The city Sevastopol in the Crimea.

02:30:48.194 --> 02:30:49.320
Where?

02:30:50.154 --> 02:30:52.240
Where in Sevastopol?

02:30:54.909 --> 02:30:57.871
<i>Sous...-marin.</i>

02:31:04.586 --> 02:31:06.129
The submarine.

02:31:08.756 --> 02:31:10.341
The <i>Sevastopol.</i>

02:31:15.096 --> 02:31:17.223
Good luck.

02:31:21.352 --> 02:31:22.979
They'll be coming, Ethan.

02:31:27.025 --> 02:31:28.568
<i>Merci.</i>

02:31:44.876 --> 02:31:46.753
What is it?

02:31:48.254 --> 02:31:49.255
What?

02:31:50.715 --> 02:31:52.383
It can only carry one.

02:31:55.470 --> 02:31:56.846
I understand.

02:31:58.014 --> 02:32:00.266
- Grace.
- Ethan, it's okay.

02:32:01.935 --> 02:32:03.144
This was the plan.

02:32:04.020 --> 02:32:06.397
You have the key. You have to go.

02:32:07.941 --> 02:32:08.775
Grace.

02:32:12.654 --> 02:32:13.947
Hunt?

02:32:13.947 --> 02:32:16.491
Go. Go!

02:32:17.283 --> 02:32:18.952
No, no! Hunt!

02:32:20.912 --> 02:32:22.330
Out of the way! Out of the way!

02:32:38.263 --> 02:32:39.639
No. No, hey.

02:32:40.640 --> 02:32:41.808
Got a pulse.

02:32:41.808 --> 02:32:43.560
Come on, stay with me.

02:33:00.660 --> 02:33:02.328
This is better, isn't it?

02:33:03.496 --> 02:33:05.874
Face to authentic face?

02:33:05.874 --> 02:33:07.250
Mr. Kittridge.

02:33:08.167 --> 02:33:11.337
Ethan Hunt tells me
you're a man I can trust.

02:33:12.297 --> 02:33:13.840
Does he now?

02:33:13.840 --> 02:33:17.510
He also said you would offer me a choice.

02:33:19.220 --> 02:33:20.847
Interesting.

02:33:21.681 --> 02:33:23.892
I choose to accept.

02:33:29.939 --> 02:33:32.567
<i>We cannot escape the past.</i>

02:33:33.526 --> 02:33:36.070
<i>Some of us are doomed to repeat it.</i>

02:33:36.779 --> 02:33:40.450
<i>Grace may believe
you've saved her from her fate,</i>

02:33:40.450 --> 02:33:43.703
<i>but you and I both know
you've merely bought her time.</i>

02:33:44.954 --> 02:33:47.790
<i>But that's the pattern, isn't it?</i>

02:33:47.790 --> 02:33:50.084
<i>The cross you've been left to bear.</i>

02:33:51.169 --> 02:33:53.421
<i>The closer someone gets to you,</i>

02:33:54.547 --> 02:33:56.466
<i>the harder it is to keep them alive.</i>

02:33:58.968 --> 02:34:00.511
Thank God.

02:34:16.110 --> 02:34:18.488
<i>A new day brings a new burden.</i>

02:34:20.365 --> 02:34:23.743
<i>The key is only the beginning.</i>

02:34:25.578 --> 02:34:27.914
<i>Wherever it leads,</i>

02:34:27.914 --> 02:34:30.041
<i>whatever it takes to get there,</i>

02:34:31.584 --> 02:34:34.295
<i>you'll have to do it on your own.</i>

02:34:36.548 --> 02:34:40.677
<i>Should you fail in your mission,
the Entity wins,</i>

02:34:40.677 --> 02:34:42.929
<i>Gabriel wins,</i>

02:34:42.929 --> 02:34:45.765
<i>and the world will pay the ultimate price.</i>

02:34:46.808 --> 02:34:50.562
<i>Should any members of your team
be caught or killed,</i>

02:34:50.562 --> 02:34:53.606
<i>their sacrifice will have been in vain.</i>

02:34:54.315 --> 02:34:55.775
<i>So hurry.</i>

02:34:56.401 --> 02:34:58.319
<i>There isn't much time.</i>

02:34:59.070 --> 02:35:03.825
<i>The world doesn't know it,
but they're counting on you.</i>

02:35:24.679 --> 02:35:26.389
<i>Good luck, Ethan.</i>
