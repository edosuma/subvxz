WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:03.670
Previously on "How to Get Away
with Murder"...

00:03.670 --> 00:04.670
So, you want to stay
with your current deal?

00:04.670 --> 00:06.000
Yes.
No.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.420
Agree to new terms, or we'll
charge you with everything.

00:07.420 --> 00:10.250
You're asking me
to commit perjury times ten.

00:10.250 --> 00:12.420
You both got to keep
your original deals.

00:12.420 --> 00:14.960
I lied.
I signed a new deal.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.460
Nate: He confessed.
It was all the Governor.

00:16.460 --> 00:17.670
We at least got to go back
and deal with his body.

00:17.670 --> 00:18.920
No, we'll leave him there.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.170
-What's this?
-You got a corrupt agent

00:20.170 --> 00:21.460
working for the Castillos.

00:21.460 --> 00:22.500
You were right.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.920
Pollock's been
in direct contact

00:23.920 --> 00:25.420
with the Castillos
for nearly a year.

00:25.420 --> 00:27.330
I have proof that Hannah
and Sam slept together.

00:27.330 --> 00:28.750
A child.

00:28.750 --> 00:29.540
Who is it?

00:29.540 --> 00:31.080
Frank.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.460
Annalise:
Guns or no guns?

00:38.670 --> 00:40.330
First day of trial --

00:40.330 --> 00:42.000
risky showing skin.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.500
Or be you -- powerful,
fear of God.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.040
Juror 3's gonna hate the guns.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.960
What do you tell clients?

00:49.960 --> 00:51.670
First day of trial,

00:51.670 --> 00:54.000
most important day
of your life.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.330
Play the part or play no part.

00:56.330 --> 00:58.380
Be yourself.

00:58.380 --> 01:00.710
Why not just throw blood
at everybody?

01:00.710 --> 01:01.750
Bougie.

01:01.750 --> 01:03.000
Masculine.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.120
Girly.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.460
Power.

01:05.460 --> 01:06.670
Too much?

01:06.670 --> 01:08.750
Won't matter
if Nate turns on you.

01:08.750 --> 01:10.040
Don't go there.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.540
Focus on the good.

01:11.540 --> 01:13.000
You have a plan.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.580
Frank to the damn rescue.

01:14.580 --> 01:15.670
Bonnie: Who is it?

01:15.670 --> 01:16.540
Annalise: Frank.

01:18.170 --> 01:19.170
Did Sam know?

01:19.170 --> 01:20.790
Of course.

01:20.790 --> 01:22.920
It's why he begged me
to get Frank out of jail.

01:22.920 --> 01:24.040
But Frank's parents --

01:24.040 --> 01:25.380
Aren't his parents.

01:25.380 --> 01:26.880
Think --

01:26.880 --> 01:29.920
why'd Sam let Frank stay
after he killed my child?

01:29.920 --> 01:31.250
He should've kicked him out
on the street.

01:31.250 --> 01:32.460
He didn't.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.540
He was protecting
his son.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.250
Frank needs to know.

01:38.250 --> 01:39.460
No.

01:39.460 --> 01:41.710
He'll go to his parents,
ruin the whole plan.

01:41.710 --> 01:43.710
What plan?

01:43.710 --> 01:46.830
We turn Hannah
to our side.

01:46.830 --> 01:48.960
This is too risky.

01:48.960 --> 01:51.250
It's my trial.
I say what's too risky.

01:52.290 --> 01:53.830
You can get her
to agree.

01:53.830 --> 01:55.120
She won't talk to me.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.000
Her lawyer will.
Here's his info.

01:58.540 --> 01:59.880
Are you sure?

02:02.080 --> 02:03.750
It's Hannah.

02:03.750 --> 02:07.540
No way in hell she lets
the world see who she really is.

02:09.620 --> 02:12.120
You'll make Hannah cave.

02:12.120 --> 02:13.170
Shame her.

02:13.170 --> 02:15.120
Incest is the last taboo.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.000
She'll sell out
the Governor to hide it.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.210
The Governor's blood,
not yours.

02:19.210 --> 02:21.920
Birkhead's blood.

02:21.920 --> 02:22.960
And then you win.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.920
Boom. You're free.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.500
Damn, this wig is good.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.540
Pretty.

02:30.540 --> 02:32.120
Safe.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.290
What they think a woman
should look like.

02:34.290 --> 02:35.710
But my hair?

02:35.710 --> 02:37.210
Real? Me?

02:37.210 --> 02:39.460
Raw? Too raw?

02:39.460 --> 02:40.830
How can we still be having
this conversation?

02:40.830 --> 02:42.250
It's just hair.

02:42.250 --> 02:43.710
But hair could decide it all.

02:43.710 --> 02:45.000
Jail or freedom.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.040
So, wig?

02:49.380 --> 02:51.120
Screw 'em.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.620
If I lose, I'm gonna
lose looking like me.

02:53.620 --> 02:55.170
Deal with it, assholes.

02:55.170 --> 02:57.750
No more scared little girl.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.580
You're Annalise damn Keating.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.620
You got this.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.620
What'll happen to Mama
if I lose?

03:12.710 --> 03:15.710
You're gonna win.

03:15.710 --> 03:17.670
You're gonna win.

03:30.420 --> 03:32.960
"Test shows an absence of
heterozygosity"?

03:32.960 --> 03:37.380
The sample contains DNA

03:37.380 --> 03:40.210
where the mother
and father's contribution

03:40.210 --> 03:41.460
are identical.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.580
What do you want?

03:45.580 --> 03:48.460
Hannah agrees to be a witness
for Annalise at the trial.

03:48.460 --> 03:49.540
That's blackmail.

03:49.540 --> 03:51.250
It's a gift.

03:51.250 --> 03:53.460
Otherwise, we out
everything in court.

03:53.460 --> 03:55.250
So, you want her
to lie on the stand?

03:55.250 --> 03:56.830
No, we want her
to tell the truth,

03:56.830 --> 03:58.380
that she colluded

03:58.380 --> 04:01.210
with both the Castillo family
and Governor Birkhead

04:01.210 --> 04:03.920
in a conspiracy
to destroy Annalise.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.120
And if that's not true?

04:06.120 --> 04:08.420
Ask your client.

04:08.420 --> 04:10.830
See if she denies it.

04:10.830 --> 04:12.710
I'll wait outside
while you call her.

04:21.420 --> 04:22.880
Oliver: Okay, here.

04:22.880 --> 04:26.250
The Internet says blue
conveys trust and honesty.

04:26.250 --> 04:27.330
But I'm a liar.

04:27.330 --> 04:28.330
Connor.

04:28.330 --> 04:29.880
Look, you should
be proud.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.540
Guilt is a sign
of being a good person.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.210
Good people go to jail.

04:34.210 --> 04:36.080
Well, I'm going
either way.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.920
For five years,
not for life.

04:37.920 --> 04:40.330
And maybe Michaela negotiated
a better deal, too.

04:40.330 --> 04:42.040
All the more reason
I should tell her.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.540
Look, Lanford will
void your deal,

04:43.540 --> 04:46.670
including the immunity
you so generously got for me.

04:46.670 --> 04:48.210
Hey.

04:48.210 --> 04:52.080
Five years, and then we can
start our life together.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.500
Promise we can
get a dog.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.330
Or we can open a shelter
and have as many as we want.

04:58.330 --> 04:59.250
Michaela: What does
that face mean?

04:59.250 --> 05:01.830
It's too alpha.

05:01.830 --> 05:03.420
I am alpha.

05:03.420 --> 05:04.880
Juries don't like alpha.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.670
You need to play
the victim here.

05:06.670 --> 05:08.420
Not a shark
who will sell out anyone

05:08.420 --> 05:10.120
to protect herself?

05:10.120 --> 05:11.670
Is this how
you got rich?

05:11.670 --> 05:14.420
By lying and cheating
and stabbing people in the back?

05:14.420 --> 05:15.830
Not more than any other
good ol' boy

05:15.830 --> 05:17.670
running the country.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.380
Here.

05:23.420 --> 05:25.290
It's disgusting.

05:25.290 --> 05:28.580
And perfect.

05:28.580 --> 05:30.880
Judge Vitkay:
This is the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania,

05:30.880 --> 05:33.250
criminal docket 78131,

05:33.250 --> 05:35.080
the United States
versus Annalise Keating.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.120
Any questions before
we bring in the jurors?

05:37.120 --> 05:38.380
The government would like
to put forth

05:38.380 --> 05:39.540
a new motion,
Your Honor.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.000
For?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.080
The removal of Tegan Price
as Ms. Keating's counsel

05:43.080 --> 05:44.580
due to
conflict of interest.

05:44.580 --> 05:46.210
Convenient Mr. Lennox
chose day 1 of trial

05:46.210 --> 05:47.460
to request this, Judge.

05:47.460 --> 05:49.580
We only found proof of
the conflict late last night.

05:49.580 --> 05:51.290
Do you have any proof
of this proof?

05:51.290 --> 05:53.960
Yes. A witness who will
testify to the conflict.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.250
Your Honor,
this is a due process

05:55.250 --> 05:56.710
discovery violation.

05:56.710 --> 05:57.790
Judge Vitkay: Not in my book.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.250
When can you have
this witness available

05:59.250 --> 06:00.620
to testify, Mr. Lennox?

06:00.620 --> 06:02.040
Right now.

06:02.040 --> 06:05.080
Give your approval, and we can
bring them in immediately.

06:31.330 --> 06:33.290
Ms. Castillo,
why did you feel the need

06:33.290 --> 06:34.790
to leave Philadelphia
so quickly?

06:34.790 --> 06:36.580
My family knew

06:36.580 --> 06:39.250
that I might testify
against them at some point,

06:39.250 --> 06:42.420
and my father had already tried
to get custody of my son.

06:43.620 --> 06:46.170
I couldn't take the chance
that he'd do worse this time.

06:46.170 --> 06:48.500
Who'd you ask for help
to flee the state?

06:50.120 --> 06:51.620
Tegan Price.

06:51.620 --> 06:52.750
And why her?

06:52.750 --> 06:55.290
She'd been a lawyer
at my father's company

06:55.290 --> 06:58.210
when I was kidnapped
as a teenager.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.040
In fact, she helped
negotiate my release.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.080
Judge, is the point here

07:02.080 --> 07:04.170
to prove I'm aligned
with the Castillo family?

07:04.170 --> 07:06.040
More that you have a long,
sordid history

07:06.040 --> 07:08.580
with multiple witnesses
testifying for the prosecution.

07:08.580 --> 07:10.290
Are you saying
Laurel is one of those?

07:10.290 --> 07:11.790
We've added her to
our witness list, yes.

07:11.790 --> 07:13.460
It's up to my client

07:13.460 --> 07:14.420
if she sees this
as a conflict of interest.

07:14.420 --> 07:17.380
A main facet
of Ms. Keating's case

07:17.380 --> 07:18.960
is that the Castillo family
conspired against her.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.580
Again, who cares if
my client waives conflict?

07:21.580 --> 07:23.040
May I speak, Judge?
What are you doing?

07:23.040 --> 07:24.670
I accept the USA's petition

07:24.670 --> 07:26.250
to remove Ms. Price
as my lawyer.

07:26.250 --> 07:27.830
Judge, I request a recess.
No need.

07:27.830 --> 07:29.170
I'm more than competent

07:29.170 --> 07:31.290
to represent myself
as sole counsel,

07:31.290 --> 07:33.250
and I'm ready to
proceed on schedule.

07:33.250 --> 07:34.880
Okay with you,
Mr. Lennox?

07:36.080 --> 07:37.880
Of course.
Good.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.540
The clerk will strike
Ms. Price as counsel

07:40.540 --> 07:42.960
and note that Ms. Keating
is acting pro se.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.420
Let's get the jury in here
in one hour

07:44.420 --> 07:45.540
to hear opening statements.

07:50.210 --> 07:52.120
Tegan:
You got a death wish?

07:52.120 --> 07:54.420
'Cause you fell
right into that man's trap.

07:54.420 --> 07:56.000
The feds' strategy
is to paint you

07:56.000 --> 07:58.330
as a manipulative,
egomaniacal mastermind.

07:58.330 --> 07:59.750
Maybe I am.

07:59.750 --> 08:01.540
And don't you dare say
it's because you don't trust me.

08:01.540 --> 08:02.710
I don't.

08:02.710 --> 08:04.580
I've been your ride or die
since day 1.

08:04.580 --> 08:06.460
Unless you're playing me.

08:06.460 --> 08:08.710
Maybe part of you
feels like I'm playing you.

08:08.710 --> 08:12.750
So, let me be your dragon
in that courtroom.

08:12.750 --> 08:15.080
God knows there might be
worse surprises coming

08:15.080 --> 08:16.500
than a two-faced Laurel.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.790
It's too late.

08:17.790 --> 08:19.290
You need me
in there, Annalise.

08:19.290 --> 08:23.170
I have to do it my way,
win or lose.

08:29.290 --> 08:31.380
I'm so sorry I ever picked
Laurel as your intern.

08:31.380 --> 08:33.460
It's not your fault.
Of course it is.

08:33.460 --> 08:37.170
You picking Laurel is no
different than me picking Sam.

08:37.170 --> 08:39.380
We thought they'd
make us feel worthy.

08:51.290 --> 08:52.500
Hey.

08:55.210 --> 08:56.710
Why is she here?

08:56.710 --> 08:58.420
To be a snitch.

08:58.420 --> 09:00.380
Where were you?

09:00.380 --> 09:01.880
Trying to find Nate.

09:01.880 --> 09:03.290
No luck.

09:03.290 --> 09:05.290
What are we doing
about the incest crap?

09:05.290 --> 09:06.750
Let me keep digging,
find proof.

09:06.750 --> 09:08.330
No, I need you
to find out

09:08.330 --> 09:10.420
the terms of those kids'
immunity deals.

09:10.420 --> 09:12.330
Go.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.460
Tell me she said yes.

09:15.460 --> 09:17.750
She wants you to agree
to an NDA.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.120
Of course.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.290
There's a penalty

09:20.290 --> 09:21.620
if you tell anyone else
about the child.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.330
How much?

09:23.330 --> 09:24.790
$100 million.

09:26.420 --> 09:28.170
Nate:
You've reached Nate Lahey.

09:28.170 --> 09:29.210
Leave a message.

09:29.210 --> 09:30.960
Your silence
is making me feel

09:30.960 --> 09:33.460
like I might need to go
to the feds myself,

09:33.460 --> 09:35.620
tell them about your
little violent streak.

09:35.620 --> 09:38.000
Or you can just call me back.

09:40.460 --> 09:41.580
Jorge: Wow.

09:41.580 --> 09:43.420
Clearly,
Annalise's trial

09:43.420 --> 09:45.380
must be going well
if she sent you to me.

09:45.380 --> 09:47.580
I came on my own.

09:47.580 --> 09:49.620
I don't want your neck
or your son.

09:53.170 --> 09:55.000
But I need your help
with the Governor.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.540
Good luck, Nate.

09:56.540 --> 09:58.790
The feds will lower
your sentence.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.750
Birkhead took the lead
on everything with my pops.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.750
I'm clear on that now.

10:06.750 --> 10:09.920
And the feds want her
more than you.

10:09.920 --> 10:12.920
So, negotiate a deal
for you and Xavier.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.500
And give them what?

10:14.500 --> 10:18.920
Testify against
Birkhead in court.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.040
So, Annalise
did send you.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.330
No.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.620
And there is no way

10:23.620 --> 10:26.540
the Governor just
lets herself get caught.

10:26.540 --> 10:27.920
We both know that.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.670
What does that mean?

10:29.670 --> 10:33.790
Get the Governor
before she gets you.

10:36.420 --> 10:41.380
Lennox:
Annalise Keating is brilliant.

10:41.380 --> 10:43.460
You'll see it
every day in this trial.

10:43.460 --> 10:47.790
She is charismatic,
captivating, charming --

10:47.790 --> 10:50.250
to the point that
she's convinced juries

10:50.250 --> 10:54.830
to acquit thieves, rapists,
murderers.

10:54.830 --> 11:01.460
Mean, intimidating,
joyless...bitch.

11:01.460 --> 11:04.420
Those are some of the names
I've been called in my life.

11:04.420 --> 11:07.580
So to hear Mr. Lennox
refer to me

11:07.580 --> 11:10.790
as charismatic, captivating,
brilliant,

11:10.790 --> 11:14.580
well...that's new to me.

11:14.580 --> 11:16.790
Lennox: A woman discovers
her husband cheated

11:16.790 --> 11:18.120
and has him murdered.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.750
Who does she get
to do it for her?

11:19.750 --> 11:23.790
Her loyal, impressionable
young group of students,

11:23.790 --> 11:26.960
led by this man --
Wes Gibbins.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.380
Wes Gibbins fooled me.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.670
He hid his mental illness,

11:31.670 --> 11:34.330
so I never saw it coming
when he killed my husband.

11:34.330 --> 11:36.540
Lennox: Sam Keating was only
the first victim

11:36.540 --> 11:38.380
in the defendant's
crime spree.

11:38.380 --> 11:42.290
Next came Rebecca Sutter,
ADA Emily Sinclair,

11:42.290 --> 11:44.670
Caleb Hapstall,
DA Ronald Miller.

11:44.670 --> 11:47.540
This is not
a conspiracy by me,

11:47.540 --> 11:48.960
but against me,

11:48.960 --> 11:51.000
because only a mob boss

11:51.000 --> 11:53.710
could commit the crimes
of this magnitude

11:53.710 --> 11:55.290
without getting caught.

11:55.290 --> 11:57.830
We have several witnesses
to tell you

11:57.830 --> 12:01.170
exactly how Ms. Keating
committed these murders.

12:01.170 --> 12:04.120
Now, those who conspired
against me...

12:04.120 --> 12:05.710
are the FBI,

12:05.710 --> 12:08.380
the billionaire
Jorge Castillo,

12:08.380 --> 12:10.080
his son Xavier,

12:10.080 --> 12:12.540
all whom acted
at the behest

12:12.540 --> 12:15.380
of the most powerful person
in this state --

12:15.380 --> 12:17.210
Governor Lynne Birkhead.

12:17.210 --> 12:18.500
I'll have to give it
to Ms. Keating --

12:18.500 --> 12:19.750
it takes a lot of nerve

12:19.750 --> 12:22.290
to accuse the Governor
of a criminal conspiracy.

12:22.290 --> 12:25.120
She ordered the murder
of my client

12:25.120 --> 12:28.120
Nathaniel Lahey Sr.
to ensure her reelection.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.790
And when the evidence

12:29.790 --> 12:31.960
exposes Ms. Keating's
web of deceit,

12:31.960 --> 12:36.420
you will see her for what she
really is -- a woman scorned.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.040
I am scorned.

12:38.040 --> 12:40.710
I'm scorned by a system
that doesn't like

12:40.710 --> 12:43.080
when a black woman
speaks truth to power.

12:43.080 --> 12:46.210
Ms. Keating abused
her power over her students,

12:46.210 --> 12:48.290
and people are dead
as a result.

12:48.290 --> 12:51.960
Joan of Arc,
MLK, Harvey Milk.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.500
My story is not
a new one.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.880
Power will do anything
to stay in power,

12:57.880 --> 13:00.170
even if that means
framing an innocent person.

13:00.170 --> 13:05.250
And if our government
can do that to me...

13:05.250 --> 13:07.670
who's to say
that you won't be next?

13:15.000 --> 13:16.880
Okay.

13:23.580 --> 13:24.420
Hi.

13:24.420 --> 13:26.830
No. Not "hi."

13:26.830 --> 13:29.420
Explain
why you're here.

13:29.420 --> 13:31.420
I'm testifying.

13:31.420 --> 13:32.790
And saying what?

13:32.790 --> 13:33.790
The same thing you are.

13:33.790 --> 13:35.920
Michaela: Which is?

13:35.920 --> 13:38.670
If you don't start talking,
I will scream bloody murder.

13:38.670 --> 13:40.380
Okay, before we get violent,
can we say hi to Christopher?

13:40.380 --> 13:41.960
Don't make me
look at him, Oliver.

13:41.960 --> 13:44.330
It's too late. I'm going in.
Hi, you little mushy mush.

13:44.330 --> 13:46.080
You got so big.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.670
How are you even here?

13:47.670 --> 13:49.420
Asher told the FBI
that I called you that night.

13:49.420 --> 13:51.500
They were able to
ping my location.

13:51.500 --> 13:52.580
Which was where?

13:53.880 --> 13:55.290
Talk!

13:55.290 --> 13:56.920
Brooklyn.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.000
You've been an hour away
this whole time?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.460
Just tell us what
Lanford wants you to say.

14:03.170 --> 14:05.830
That Annalise ordered
Sam's murder.

14:05.830 --> 14:07.250
And?

14:07.250 --> 14:10.460
And the thing
about Wes.

14:12.540 --> 14:13.880
You too?

14:13.880 --> 14:15.670
Yes.
Yes.

14:15.670 --> 14:18.290
Hey, so, um,
am I Christopher's guardian

14:18.290 --> 14:19.540
when you go to jail?

14:19.540 --> 14:20.460
What?

14:20.460 --> 14:21.830
We got five years.

14:21.830 --> 14:23.000
Didn't you?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.250
I negotiated probation.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.210
As long as I never get
another felony,

14:27.210 --> 14:29.210
Christopher gets
to stay with me.

14:29.210 --> 14:31.000
So, no years.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.330
Is that what
you're saying?

14:32.330 --> 14:33.710
Yeah.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.500
Clerk: Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

14:37.500 --> 14:39.460
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

14:39.460 --> 14:40.580
I do.

14:46.120 --> 14:47.500
Judge Vitkay:
Are you ready, Mr. Lennox?

14:47.500 --> 14:50.000
Lennox:
Yes, Your Honor.

14:56.420 --> 14:59.040
Ms. Pratt, why were you
at Professor Keating's

14:59.040 --> 15:01.210
the night of the bonfire?

15:01.210 --> 15:03.330
We were working --
Connor, Laurel, and I.

15:03.330 --> 15:05.080
Uh, Rebecca's trial
was coming up,

15:05.080 --> 15:06.580
so it was
all hands on deck.

15:06.580 --> 15:08.170
Was Professor Keating
there?

15:09.710 --> 15:11.290
Hi. Mr. Keating.
Sam: What do you want?

15:11.290 --> 15:12.420
Is Professor Keating around?

15:12.420 --> 15:14.420
She's not here.
You should go.

15:14.420 --> 15:17.620
No, but Sam was home --
upstairs in their bedroom.

15:17.620 --> 15:18.960
Lennox: When did
Mr. Gibbins arrive?

15:18.960 --> 15:20.330
I don't remember,

15:20.330 --> 15:23.380
but i-it was obvious
something was wrong.

15:23.380 --> 15:27.790
He was on edge, amped up,
and, um, asked where Sam was.

15:27.790 --> 15:31.460
Did you know what Wes was
going to talk to Sam about?

15:31.460 --> 15:32.500
Get out of my house.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.420
Let Rebecca go,
then we'll leave.

15:34.420 --> 15:36.290
No.

15:37.420 --> 15:41.330
We just heard yelling,
so we went upstairs.

15:41.330 --> 15:43.500
Wes and Sam
were fighting.

15:43.500 --> 15:47.120
It was --
It was awful, chaotic.

15:47.120 --> 15:51.290
The next thing I saw...

15:51.290 --> 15:55.000
Wes pushed Sam
over the railing.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.460
We thought Sam was dead,

16:02.460 --> 16:05.420
but then he started to move,
and I was so relieved.

16:05.420 --> 16:07.080
Until...

16:09.120 --> 16:13.830
Until Wes, he -- he hit him
in the head with this statue.

16:13.830 --> 16:15.380
Aah!

16:19.080 --> 16:20.750
We all panicked.

16:20.750 --> 16:23.500
I wanted to call the police,
but Wes stopped me.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.330
Lennox:
What did he say?

16:25.330 --> 16:26.880
Shouldn't we be
calling the police?

16:26.880 --> 16:28.920
No. No one knows
we were here.

16:28.920 --> 16:31.250
That this is what
Annalise wanted.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.960
We didn't believe him
until she came home.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.460
Lennox:
What did Annalise say?

16:35.460 --> 16:38.080
That we had to help Wes
get rid of the body.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.380
Why did you
listen to her?

16:40.380 --> 16:42.790
She was this renowned
defense attorney.

16:42.790 --> 16:44.380
We were just 1Ls.

16:44.380 --> 16:47.000
She could've made it
look like we did it.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.380
Why do you think Wes would
do this for Professor Keating?

16:51.380 --> 16:53.120
Was there more to
the story there?

16:54.880 --> 16:56.460
Yes.

16:56.460 --> 16:58.080
What?

17:00.830 --> 17:03.460
She was
sleeping with him.

17:15.170 --> 17:17.620
Annalise: Idiot.
Coulda let them rot in jail.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.210
You had to fix it.
Savior complex.

17:20.210 --> 17:22.880
Ms. Keating,
ready for your cross?

17:22.880 --> 17:25.460
Ready to rip her head off.

17:25.460 --> 17:28.040
Thank you, Your Honor.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.580
Ms. Pratt,

17:29.580 --> 17:31.120
do you have proof
that I was sleeping with Wes?

17:31.120 --> 17:32.620
He told us.

17:32.620 --> 17:34.920
Didn't I teach you
the definition of hearsay?

17:34.920 --> 17:36.540
I saw the way you looked
at each other,

17:36.540 --> 17:38.920
and you would often bring him
into your office alone.

17:38.920 --> 17:40.620
Wouldn't I bring you
into my office alone?

17:40.620 --> 17:42.120
Not as much as Wes.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.500
Would you lie
to get ahead?

17:45.500 --> 17:46.830
No.

17:46.830 --> 17:48.920
You wouldn't let ambition
cloud your judgement?

17:48.920 --> 17:50.960
I-I don't understand
the question.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.920
You came to Middleton
to study under me, correct?
Yes.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.330
That was before I knew

17:55.330 --> 17:57.250
you were an egomaniacal,
narcissistic alcoholic.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.420
Motion to strike and admonish
the witness, Your Honor.

17:59.420 --> 18:01.540
Stricken.
Ms. Pratt, you know better.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.080
Is it possible

18:03.080 --> 18:05.170
that you were so desperate
for my approval

18:05.170 --> 18:08.670
that you helped Wes
kill my cheating husband

18:08.670 --> 18:09.670
to please me?

18:09.670 --> 18:12.420
No. I did it
because you told me to.

18:12.420 --> 18:14.330
Ah.

18:14.330 --> 18:18.710
Did I tell you to
deport Simon Drake?

18:18.710 --> 18:19.920
Annalise: Why?
Michaela:
Someone needed to step up

18:19.920 --> 18:21.880
and do the thing that
you didn't have the balls to do

18:21.880 --> 18:23.380
to keep us safe.

18:23.380 --> 18:26.500
Answer -- did or
did you not call ICE

18:26.500 --> 18:29.170
to deport your fellow classmate
Simon Drake?

18:29.170 --> 18:31.040
No. I did not.

18:32.540 --> 18:34.210
Clark: This is Officer Clark
from Immigration and Customs.

18:34.210 --> 18:35.420
Your name, please?

18:35.420 --> 18:36.920
Michaela: I'd like
to stay anonymous.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.290
Reason for calling?

18:38.290 --> 18:39.830
I want to report
an undocumented immigrant

18:39.830 --> 18:40.960
in Philadelphia.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.580
His name is Simon Drake,

18:42.580 --> 18:45.290
and he brought
an unregistered gun to work.

18:46.420 --> 18:47.710
That's not me.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.120
This isn't your voice?

18:49.120 --> 18:50.670
Asked and answered, Judge.
Perjury's illegal, Ms. Pratt.

18:50.670 --> 18:52.040
Your Honor --
Or did the FBI tell you

18:52.040 --> 18:54.330
to lie about this call --
Jurors, disregard this question.

18:54.330 --> 18:55.790
...just like you're lying
about everything today?

18:55.790 --> 18:56.960
Stop her.
Ms. Keating.
As long as you get your way,

18:56.960 --> 18:58.500
you don't care
who suffers as a result...
Ms. Keating.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.330
of your greed and ambition!
Judge. Judge.

18:59.330 --> 19:00.670
Ms. Keating,

19:00.670 --> 19:03.290
stop this attack right now,
or I'll censure you.

19:03.290 --> 19:04.790
I won't have any of this
behavior in my courtroom.

19:04.790 --> 19:05.920
Understood?

19:07.330 --> 19:10.540
That was good. Good to show
the jury your fiery side.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.000
7 of the 12 were with you.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.830
They'd all be with me
if I broke her.

19:13.830 --> 19:15.620
You'll break Connor.

19:18.460 --> 19:20.580
Tell Hannah I agree
to the $100 million.

19:20.580 --> 19:21.580
Are you sure?

19:21.580 --> 19:23.920
No. No.
That is insane.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.580
I need Hannah to win.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.460
Make the deal.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.790
So was it all a game?

19:40.960 --> 19:42.710
You get me to fall for you,
say, what, I'm too dumb

19:42.710 --> 19:44.380
to -- to figure
it all out?

19:44.380 --> 19:45.960
No, I-I really liked you.
I still do.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.120
Don't.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.380
I kept this from you,
Gabriel, yes,

19:48.380 --> 19:49.620
but --
but everything else --

19:49.620 --> 19:52.080
our connection,
that -- that was real.

19:52.080 --> 19:55.250
You killed my father...

19:55.250 --> 19:57.040
and then you got with me.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.540
That's sick.

19:58.540 --> 19:59.880
You're sick.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.540
You know what's worse?

20:01.540 --> 20:04.290
It's that...

20:04.290 --> 20:06.710

Why didn't you tell me
you wanted to leave?

20:49.790 --> 20:50.880
So you could

21:09.290 --> 21:11.670
I've missed you,

21:11.670 --> 21:13.620
and I know that
that's the worst thing to say

21:13.620 --> 21:17.080
because all you've done
is be there for us

21:17.080 --> 21:19.120

21:37.120 --> 21:40.710
Annalise thinks
that I fell for you

21:40.710 --> 21:42.580
so I'd feel worthy.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.880
I think she's right.

21:47.830 --> 21:50.120
I always hated myself.

21:50.120 --> 21:53.330
So, you...

21:53.330 --> 21:56.120
picking me,
that felt good.

21:56.120 --> 21:59.670
You are good.

21:59.670 --> 22:02.380
You've been a father to
Christopher more than anyone.

22:03.580 --> 22:06.540
And I took that
from him.

22:06.540 --> 22:08.460
You got out.

22:08.460 --> 22:09.790
Saved yourself.

22:10.790 --> 22:13.000
And him.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.080
There's not
a lot of people

22:14.080 --> 22:15.790

22:17.580 --> 22:19.380
That's how I know
you're strong enough

22:19.380 --> 22:20.880

22:22.830 --> 22:26.080
Don't testify
against Annalise.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.960
You owe me that.

to call your next witness,

23:31.750 --> 23:33.120
Mr. Lennox?

23:33.120 --> 23:35.120
The government would like to
call Connor Walsh to testify.

23:35.120 --> 23:38.080
Hey, some intel on
the kids' deals.

23:39.830 --> 23:40.790
You believe this?

23:40.790 --> 23:42.080
Does it matter?

23:44.210 --> 23:46.000
Tell him.

23:49.670 --> 23:51.670
Michaela got
a better deal.

23:57.170 --> 23:59.250
Clerk: Right hand up.

23:59.250 --> 24:00.670
Do you swear
to tell the truth,

24:00.670 --> 24:03.670
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

24:03.670 --> 24:05.380
I...

24:09.210 --> 24:11.920
Mr. Walsh,
do you need a moment?

24:11.920 --> 24:14.920
Mr. Walsh?
Mr. Walsh, stay calm.

24:20.500 --> 24:23.000
Lanford: Do you want me
to void your deal?

24:23.000 --> 24:25.120
Because I didn't buy this stunt
the first time around.

24:25.120 --> 24:28.250
It's 'cause I was
faking then, too.

24:28.250 --> 24:29.830
Did you give Michaela
a better deal?

24:29.830 --> 24:31.790
No. Why would you
think that?

24:31.790 --> 24:33.460
She's getting five years?
Yes.

24:33.460 --> 24:34.670
If anyone got a better deal,

24:34.670 --> 24:36.790
it's you getting immunity
for your husband.

24:36.790 --> 24:39.210
But if you want out,

24:39.210 --> 24:42.040
I hear Michaela's testimony
did the job.

24:44.460 --> 24:48.120
That's when
Professor Keating came home,

24:48.120 --> 24:49.830
and she started
giving orders

24:49.830 --> 24:52.210
about how to get rid
of Sam's body

24:52.210 --> 24:55.500
and how we couldn't
tell anyone.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.920
Why go along with it?

24:56.920 --> 25:00.330
Because it was her.

25:00.330 --> 25:02.120
She, um...

25:05.500 --> 25:08.960
All I wanted was
to make her happy.

25:11.290 --> 25:15.000
It's sick, I know,
but it's the truth.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.290
No more questions
for this witness.

25:18.500 --> 25:20.210
Ms. Keating,
do you need a recess?

25:20.210 --> 25:21.710
I'm good.

25:21.710 --> 25:23.620
Annalise: Let's take this lamb
to the slaughter.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.830
Mr. Walsh, did you have
that panic attack

25:25.830 --> 25:28.460
because you feel guilty about
the lies you're about to tell?

25:28.460 --> 25:32.330
No. I'm nervous that I have
to relive all of this.

25:32.330 --> 25:34.540
And will you be punished
for what you did?

25:34.540 --> 25:36.620
Or did you cut a deal
to testify against me?

25:36.620 --> 25:38.620
Plea deal testimony
is routine.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.880
Is it routine to lie as
a part of those plea deals?

25:40.880 --> 25:41.960
I'm not lying.

25:41.960 --> 25:43.330
I wouldn't blame you.

25:43.330 --> 25:44.920
You're a gay man.
Prison could be tough.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.290
Objection. Irrelevant
and prejudicial.

25:46.290 --> 25:48.000
I'm a bisexual woman,
Your Honor.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.250
I have no interest
in gay-shaming.

25:50.250 --> 25:51.790
Number 3
is not liking that.

25:51.790 --> 25:53.210
Judge Vitkay:
Move on, Ms. Keating.

25:53.210 --> 25:55.710
Mr. Walsh, do you know
why I picked you as an intern?

25:55.710 --> 25:57.000
Because I wrote an essay

25:57.000 --> 25:59.250
about how I shut down
a gay conversion therapy camp.

25:59.250 --> 26:01.330
A camp that never
existed, did it?

26:04.290 --> 26:07.080
I called.
There's no such place.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.710
So, that's why
you picked me.

26:13.710 --> 26:16.620
'Cause you knew I was a liar
and I would lie for you.

26:16.620 --> 26:19.500
No, I only found out
that you were lying last week.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.170
All this time, I thought
you were a good person.

26:21.170 --> 26:22.830
Objection.
Badgering the witness.

26:22.830 --> 26:24.380
Sustained.

26:24.380 --> 26:25.330
Mr. Walsh,
are you currently lying

26:25.330 --> 26:26.670
to your husband, Oliver?

26:26.670 --> 26:27.920
Relevance?

26:27.920 --> 26:29.290
Let me be more specific.

26:29.290 --> 26:30.790
Does your husband know

26:30.790 --> 26:33.380
that you only married him
to appear like a good person?

26:33.380 --> 26:34.670
Lennox: Objection.
Argumentative.

26:34.670 --> 26:37.040
Did you not pretend to be
into him on your first date

26:37.040 --> 26:38.420
just to get intel
for a case?

26:38.420 --> 26:39.670
Judge Vitkay:
I'll sanction you, Ms. Keating.

26:39.670 --> 26:42.040
Did you use him then just like
you continued to use him?

26:42.040 --> 26:43.210
You see how much
of a bully she is?

26:43.210 --> 26:44.210
Enough.

26:44.210 --> 26:45.920
It's my job
to get at the truth.

26:45.920 --> 26:46.960
Is that too hard for you?

26:46.960 --> 26:48.290
Look, I might not be
a perfect person.

26:48.290 --> 26:49.330
Stop, Mr. Walsh.
Clearly.

26:49.330 --> 26:50.330
But I'm not
as awful as you.

26:50.330 --> 26:51.460
So, you're lying
about me today

26:51.460 --> 26:53.080
because
you just don't like me?

26:53.080 --> 26:55.210
This cross is over.
Do both of you understand?

26:55.210 --> 26:56.790
We're taking a recess.

26:56.790 --> 26:57.880
Any outbursts of
this nature happen again,

26:57.880 --> 26:59.790
I'll hold you in contempt.

27:02.790 --> 27:05.210
I found a bottle
of something called Bénédictine

27:05.210 --> 27:06.250
in the pantry.

27:06.250 --> 27:09.170
As long as
it's alcohol, gimme.

27:09.170 --> 27:10.960
Can't believe I let her
get inside my head.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.500
She was making up lies
about your boo-thang.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.880
Of course you got mad.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.960
And who cares if you lied
about some conversion camp?

27:15.960 --> 27:17.880
She's lied
about way worse.

27:17.880 --> 27:20.540
And you?

27:20.540 --> 27:21.790
Frank told me
you got a better deal

27:21.790 --> 27:23.000
right before
I took the stand.

27:25.290 --> 27:28.170
He was messing
with your head.

27:29.540 --> 27:31.330
Yeah, I know.
I just -- I had to ask.

27:36.710 --> 27:38.420
Hannah has a new request.

27:38.420 --> 27:39.620
Tegan: Here we go.

27:39.620 --> 27:44.290
If she testifies against
the Governor and you win,

27:44.290 --> 27:48.880
she wants you to admit publicly
that you killed Sam.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.580
Unh-unh.

27:50.580 --> 27:52.710
She's trying to guarantee
that you suffer even if you win.

27:52.710 --> 27:54.880
So game over.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.750
Subpoena that...woman

27:56.750 --> 27:58.960
so you can rip her
heart out on the stand.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.500
Don't tell me
you're considering this.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.710
Hannah is the best witness
I can ask for.

28:04.710 --> 28:06.000
She's making you say

28:06.000 --> 28:07.710
you killed the husband
you did not kill.

28:07.710 --> 28:08.960
I'm losing, Tegan.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.620
No, you're not.

28:10.620 --> 28:12.120
Look here.

28:13.420 --> 28:17.040
My scorecard says we've got
our loyal six right here,

28:17.040 --> 28:20.620
and I'm feeling Meathead,
Stink-eye, and Plumber

28:20.620 --> 28:21.710
swinging your way.

28:21.710 --> 28:24.120
And after Laurel
tells the same lie

28:24.120 --> 28:26.620
or Lennox pulls out
another surprise witness?

28:26.620 --> 28:29.540
Asher from the grave,
Wes...

28:30.750 --> 28:35.040
Annalise, if you ever say
you had anything to do with Sam,

28:35.040 --> 28:37.960
let alone that you hurt him,
you lose everything --

28:37.960 --> 28:42.880
career, reputation, legacy,
your life destroyed.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.920
So you're saying no.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.670
You hear me?

28:47.670 --> 28:49.210
Okay?

28:50.670 --> 28:52.250
You say no.

28:55.460 --> 28:59.290
Vodka, dear vodka,
why you gotta be so good?

28:59.290 --> 29:01.880
No.
You know how to think.

29:01.880 --> 29:04.250
No vodka needed,
so think, think.

29:04.250 --> 29:05.790
Give Hannah what she wants.

29:05.790 --> 29:07.960
Choose freedom.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.790
Bye-bye, law. So what?

29:09.790 --> 29:11.000
Look where law's got you.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.580
Dead bodies piling up.

29:12.580 --> 29:14.040
Enough.

29:14.040 --> 29:15.620
No more professor, law partner.

29:15.620 --> 29:17.460
No anything. Just free.

29:17.460 --> 29:20.710
Sign it.
Give Hannah what she wants.

29:20.710 --> 29:23.040
Tegan: No way we're letting her
sign that contract.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.420
Do you think
either of us have a say?

29:25.420 --> 29:27.040
She's doing it
out of fear, Bonnie,

29:27.040 --> 29:28.960
and Hannah's the one
who started all of this

29:28.960 --> 29:31.000
with her sexy sister act.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.210
So, no,
we can't let her win.

29:34.210 --> 29:37.040
If Annalise were
just another client...

29:37.040 --> 29:41.000
but this is
Annalise freaking Keating.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.420
She's no one
if not a lawyer.

29:45.540 --> 29:47.710
Or you're just afraid
to lose her.

29:49.170 --> 29:50.330
What?

29:50.330 --> 29:54.710
If she signs,
she leaves C&G, Philly.

30:00.290 --> 30:02.880
She makes me feel alive.

30:05.420 --> 30:07.670
Why do you think
I stayed all this time?

30:11.580 --> 30:14.620
This is why I usually
drink alone.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.580
Thought you were special,
didn't you?

30:17.580 --> 30:19.040
Sitting up here
in a penthouse.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.830
Poor Memphis trash.

30:20.830 --> 30:22.420
Not fooling anyone.

30:22.420 --> 30:25.040
How to get away with murder?
Please.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.460
How to ruin everything.

30:26.460 --> 30:29.330
Teach that class.
You're the expert.

30:29.330 --> 30:31.620
Or how to kill yourself.

30:31.620 --> 30:34.120
Can't believe you haven't
done that already.

30:34.120 --> 30:36.460
Stop it, okay?

30:36.460 --> 30:37.960
Just stop it now.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.920
Hannah doesn't get to win this.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.000
You're smarter than this.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.710
So, be smart, Annalise.

30:42.710 --> 30:43.920
Be smart.
Be smart.

30:43.920 --> 30:47.040
Be smart, be smart,
be smart, be smart,

30:47.040 --> 30:49.380
be smart, be smart, be smart.

30:49.380 --> 30:52.000
Be smart.

30:53.790 --> 30:55.420
Thanks for coming.

30:55.420 --> 30:58.210
I told the guard I was just
using the restroom.

30:58.210 --> 31:01.920
Good.
This won't take long.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.540
Ms. Castillo, how did you feel

31:13.540 --> 31:15.540
when you got picked
for the Keating Five?

31:15.540 --> 31:17.960
I felt great.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.670
Special.

31:19.670 --> 31:22.960
Say the right thing,
and you'll still be special.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.250
Well, that was before
all of this, of course.

31:25.250 --> 31:26.710
Would Professor Keating
ever ask you

31:26.710 --> 31:29.540
to do anything unethical
while working cases?

31:29.540 --> 31:31.710
We would do
what she asked --

31:31.710 --> 31:34.830
lie, blackmail,
coerce witnesses.

31:34.830 --> 31:37.250
Why wouldn't you say no?

31:37.250 --> 31:40.250
You don't say no
to Professor Keating.

31:40.250 --> 31:41.790
Annalise: You chose
to keep Christopher safe.

31:41.790 --> 31:43.420
I understand.

31:43.420 --> 31:46.580
But let me remind you
of why your boy's alive.

31:46.580 --> 31:48.880
I pumped his chest
with my fingers.

31:48.880 --> 31:50.500
So, that's all this is?
Us trading favors?

31:50.500 --> 31:52.290
'Cause everything's
a transaction with you.

31:52.290 --> 31:55.000
You ruined my life, and all
I'm asking for is some mercy.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.380
You ruined your life.

31:56.380 --> 31:57.670
You just blame us

31:57.670 --> 31:59.500
because you can never take
any responsibility.

31:59.500 --> 32:00.670
How about you take
responsibility?

32:00.670 --> 32:02.380
My life
has been nothing but hell

32:02.380 --> 32:04.000
since you walked
into my classroom.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.380
My family came for you

32:05.380 --> 32:06.920
after everything
that happened with Sam.

32:06.920 --> 32:10.250
Your family killed Wes
and then Nate Sr.

32:10.250 --> 32:12.500
Then go after them.
Fine.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.460
But I'm doing
what's right for my son,

32:14.460 --> 32:17.290
the only innocent person
in all of this.

32:17.290 --> 32:18.580
Lennox:
Did you ever feel guilty

32:18.580 --> 32:21.750
about doing something
Annalise asked you to do?

32:21.750 --> 32:22.960
The opposite.

32:22.960 --> 32:25.710
She'd praise us, and, I mean,
nothing felt better.

32:25.710 --> 32:30.000
Is that how you felt the night
of the Sam Keating murder?

32:30.000 --> 32:34.420
That night was awful
in every sense of the word.

32:34.420 --> 32:38.290
We were just...students.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.330
We never asked for anything
other than to learn the law.

32:42.750 --> 32:44.290
Annalise: And do you know
what happened to Frank

32:44.290 --> 32:45.540
since you've been gone?

32:45.540 --> 32:48.000
Xavier tried to
torture him to death.

32:49.750 --> 32:50.580
Is that true?

32:50.580 --> 32:52.000
He almost died.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.250
It's a miracle
he's even standing there.

32:55.250 --> 32:57.080
I have no choice
but to take this deal.

32:57.080 --> 32:59.170
Otherwise, I go to jail
and lose Christopher.

32:59.170 --> 33:01.290
No. Not if I win.

33:01.290 --> 33:03.170
They're not gonna prosecute
anyone else for this.

33:03.170 --> 33:04.620
No, you don't know that.

33:04.620 --> 33:06.880
If you do this, you're
no better than your father!

33:08.420 --> 33:10.380
Christopher is gonna learn
what you've done,

33:10.380 --> 33:12.750
and he's gonna
hate you for this.

33:12.750 --> 33:14.080
You're gonna be his enemy,

33:14.080 --> 33:15.420
just like your father
is your enemy.

33:15.420 --> 33:17.080
Is that what you want?

33:17.080 --> 33:21.460
Laurel, you'll be the mother
that your son hates.

33:21.460 --> 33:23.250
The woman with no children

33:23.250 --> 33:25.670
doesn't get to tell me
what do with mine.

33:29.620 --> 33:33.750
You decide
who you want to be here.

33:33.750 --> 33:36.500
This is the moment.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.250
I'm a mother

33:38.250 --> 33:40.540
who will die
to protect her child.

33:44.080 --> 33:46.170
Don't you dare
follow me.

33:47.580 --> 33:49.120
Lennox:
Ms. Castillo, are you aware

33:49.120 --> 33:53.040
that the behaviors you're
describing in Professor Keating

33:53.040 --> 33:55.460
are techniques commonly used
in brainwashing?

33:55.460 --> 33:58.250
Judge, Mr. Lennox has no
qualifications in psychology.

33:58.250 --> 33:59.290
You don't need
a psych degree

33:59.290 --> 34:00.710
to see Ms. Keating
abused her power.

34:00.710 --> 34:04.000
The witness is not qualified
as an expert, nor is the USA.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.580
Manipulation,
indoctrination, isolation,

34:06.580 --> 34:07.960
pathological lying.

34:07.960 --> 34:10.880
All of these are straight
out of a Psych 101 handbook.

34:10.880 --> 34:13.460
And the FBI
handbook, too.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.830
I'm sorry. Um...

34:18.830 --> 34:21.580
Everything I've said on
the stand here has been a lie

34:21.580 --> 34:24.290
that Agent Lanford
asked me to say.

34:24.290 --> 34:27.170
Lennox: Ms. Castillo,
you signed an affidavit

34:27.170 --> 34:28.750
with these facts
before the trial.

34:28.750 --> 34:31.790
It's because
I was coerced by the FBI,

34:31.790 --> 34:35.040
so under U.S. v. Gonzalez,
it's void.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.580
Annalise and Wes
were not sleeping together.

34:36.580 --> 34:38.880
Your Honor,
recess, please.
My son is proof.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.790
Wes is his father because
I was sleeping with him,

34:40.790 --> 34:42.710
not Annalise.

34:42.710 --> 34:45.380
I mean, I'm the one who didn't
see how not okay Wes was.

34:45.380 --> 34:47.210
And that's why he killed Sam.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.620
Not 'cause someone
ordered him to,

34:48.620 --> 34:50.330
but because
he was mentally ill.

34:50.330 --> 34:51.290
Objection.
That's not in evidence.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.830
You're objecting
to your own witness?

34:52.830 --> 34:57.330
Annalise did not ask Wes
to do any of this.

34:57.330 --> 34:59.540
Wes did it on his own.

35:04.460 --> 35:06.460
I'm sorry I lied, Annalise.

35:13.830 --> 35:16.080
What the hell
did you say to the girl?

35:16.080 --> 35:19.080
Because that about-face
has the entire jury

35:19.080 --> 35:21.460
screaming one word
in their heads --

35:21.460 --> 35:23.920
♪ Doubt, doubt,
and more doubt ♪

35:23.920 --> 35:25.420
Nate still has to
testify.

35:25.420 --> 35:27.670
And the world
could end tomorrow.

35:27.670 --> 35:30.170
But right now, we are
taking a victory lap.

35:30.170 --> 35:32.040
Hand me
Hannah's contract.

35:32.040 --> 35:33.420
Annalise, no.

35:33.420 --> 35:34.830
I know you think
we're winning. I get it.

35:34.830 --> 35:36.790
But it's Laurel's word
against Michaela and Connor,

35:36.790 --> 35:38.210
and I want to know
we'll win.

35:38.210 --> 35:39.250
And destroy your life
in the process?

35:39.250 --> 35:40.920
Is that so bad?

35:40.920 --> 35:43.000
'Cause I've been fighting
my whole life to get here,

35:43.000 --> 35:46.170
to belong, feel normal,
be enough,

35:46.170 --> 35:47.580
and look where
it's gotten me.

35:47.580 --> 35:50.040
Twelve strangers
deciding my fate.

35:50.040 --> 35:52.170
But Hannah gets me free.

35:52.170 --> 35:53.540
And that means more to me

35:53.540 --> 35:56.750
than any story
I've made up about myself.

35:56.750 --> 35:58.750
I'll come up with
a new story.

36:02.040 --> 36:03.210
There.

36:06.580 --> 36:08.170
Annalise Keating is dead.

36:18.920 --> 36:21.580
Can we talk?

36:21.580 --> 36:24.290
Annalise needs me to
read over Laurel's testimony.

36:24.290 --> 36:26.500
Laurel's who I want
to talk about.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.210
Annalise may still
go down,

36:32.210 --> 36:34.500
and we'll go down
with her.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.960
I just don't want to keep
anything from you.

36:38.750 --> 36:41.170
What are you
keeping from me?

36:43.830 --> 36:45.750
I still love her.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.670
Michaela:
I wish I had a better word,

36:55.670 --> 36:58.040
but "bitch" is the only way
to describe you right now.

36:58.040 --> 36:59.290
Connor:
Psycho? Traitor?

36:59.290 --> 37:01.080
Call me
whatever you want, okay?

37:01.080 --> 37:02.920
Just be quiet so that
Christopher doesn't hear.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.080
Screw Christopher.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.620
Michaela.
She got knocked up.

37:05.620 --> 37:07.210
That doesn't mean she gets
to parade out her kid

37:07.210 --> 37:09.040
every time she wants to defend
one of her evil decisions.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.830
-You're right.
-Then why didn't you tell us?

37:10.830 --> 37:13.000
I didn't know I was gonna do it
until I was on the stand.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.080
'Cause you're a coward.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.380
And a bitch.

37:15.380 --> 37:16.790
Connor:
Look, I get feeling guilty

37:16.790 --> 37:18.790
about everything
that your family's done,

37:18.790 --> 37:20.210
but don't you feel guilty
that the judge now thinks

37:20.210 --> 37:21.380
we perjured ourselves?

37:21.380 --> 37:22.960
Well, you did
perjure yourselves.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.500
And you're judging us
for that?

37:24.500 --> 37:25.830
The girl who lied about
having my wedding ring

37:25.830 --> 37:27.500
and brought a gun
to C&G?

37:27.500 --> 37:30.170
You both said things
that will put Annalise
in jail for life.

37:30.170 --> 37:31.580
She deserves that.

37:31.580 --> 37:33.040
Okay, then we all deserve it,
because we all agreed

37:33.040 --> 37:34.380
to help cover up
Sam's murder.

37:34.380 --> 37:36.620
No, you helped Wes to
convince us to cover it up.

37:36.620 --> 37:38.380
You pushed Sam
over the railing.

37:38.380 --> 37:41.170
So, you need proof that
you're a terrible human?

37:41.170 --> 37:43.080
You voided your deal today,

37:43.080 --> 37:44.120
which means you're gonna
go to jail

37:44.120 --> 37:45.210
and your precious
little child

37:45.210 --> 37:46.750
is gonna grow up
without a mother.

37:46.750 --> 37:47.750
Not if Annalise wins.

37:47.750 --> 37:48.880
She's not gonna win!

37:48.880 --> 37:51.620
I just needed to do
what is right, okay?

37:51.620 --> 37:53.000
Isn't that what
you want, too?

37:53.000 --> 37:54.290
To stop pretending
like we're people

37:54.290 --> 37:56.710
who can just lie and cheat
and be okay with it?

37:56.710 --> 37:58.330
I am that person.

37:58.330 --> 37:59.920
Well, I'm not.

37:59.920 --> 38:01.540
I want to be good.

38:01.540 --> 38:02.920
So do I.

38:02.920 --> 38:04.250
I mean, why do you think
I took the deal?

38:04.250 --> 38:05.920
I'm okay going to prison.
It's what we deserve.

38:05.920 --> 38:07.250
I disagree.

38:07.250 --> 38:08.750
Well, you're going,
so get over it.

38:08.750 --> 38:10.540
No, I'm not.

38:10.540 --> 38:12.000
What?

38:14.500 --> 38:16.120
Frank was telling
the truth.

38:16.120 --> 38:18.460
I negotiated a new deal.

38:18.460 --> 38:20.580
That says what?

38:20.580 --> 38:23.540
Probation, no jail time.

38:23.540 --> 38:25.790
No.

38:25.790 --> 38:27.580
I'm sorry.

38:30.540 --> 38:32.460
You sure your client's
in her right mind?

38:32.460 --> 38:34.040
She just wants this
to be over.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.120
Alright.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.460
I'll get Hannah's signature,

38:36.460 --> 38:38.790
and we'll be in court
whenever you say.

38:45.330 --> 38:46.330
Michaela: You can
go to Lanford right now

38:46.330 --> 38:47.580
and get the same deal.

38:47.580 --> 38:49.960
How? Is your daddy gonna
pay off the FBI for me, too?

38:49.960 --> 38:51.790
Hey.
Why are you so angry at me?

38:51.790 --> 38:53.670
You hid that
you got Oliver immunity,

38:53.670 --> 38:55.670
and you just said that
you're okay with going to jail.

38:55.670 --> 38:57.540
That was before I knew
we didn't have to go.

38:57.540 --> 38:58.710
Hey.

38:58.710 --> 39:00.580
What's wrong?

39:00.580 --> 39:02.460
My brother's dead.

39:02.460 --> 39:04.290
Anchorwoman:
The body of Xavier Castillo,

39:04.290 --> 39:07.250
acting CEO of
Antares Technologies,

39:07.250 --> 39:09.710
was discovered
in Harrisburg today.

39:09.710 --> 39:12.670
Authorities had dismissed
previous claims

39:12.670 --> 39:14.920
that the Governor
knew Mr. Castillo...

39:14.920 --> 39:16.790
Was this Frank?

39:16.790 --> 39:18.460
...there are now
phone records...

39:18.460 --> 39:20.960
Nate.

39:20.960 --> 39:23.250
The Governor is now likely
to face questions

39:23.250 --> 39:27.080
about her ties
to Xavier Castillo.

39:27.080 --> 39:30.670
How do I know
this wasn't you?

39:30.670 --> 39:34.580
If it was me, Xavier would be
in FBI custody right now.

39:34.580 --> 39:37.420
He'd be telling everything
Birkhead made him do,

39:37.420 --> 39:39.920
but she made sure
that didn't happen.

39:44.500 --> 39:46.710
Take the stand.

39:51.540 --> 39:53.040
Tell the truth.

39:53.040 --> 39:55.000
Do it for your boy.

40:04.420 --> 40:06.380
Annalise.

40:06.380 --> 40:08.120
Annalise: We heard.
We're celebrating.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.710
It's sparkling water.

40:09.710 --> 40:12.500
'Cause a dead Xavier
is a good thing, sure.

40:13.540 --> 40:15.330
What's wrong?

40:15.330 --> 40:17.380
I just got off the phone
with Floyd.

40:18.330 --> 40:19.710
Floyd: I came here
to deliver something,

40:19.710 --> 40:21.420
and, my God.

40:22.710 --> 40:25.460
-Looks like a possible match.
-Alright. I'll call it in.

40:25.460 --> 40:27.000
Officer: Dispatch,
bring in ballistics.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.790
We need to confirm
that the gun is registered

40:28.790 --> 40:31.080
to a Hannah Keating.

40:31.080 --> 40:34.000
Gonna start a GSR test now.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.290
Floyd went to have her
sign the contract,

40:36.290 --> 40:39.120
but when he got there...

40:39.120 --> 40:41.080
They're saying
it's a suicide.

40:41.080 --> 40:42.120
No.

40:43.790 --> 40:45.250
Birkhead did it.

40:47.120 --> 40:48.380
Or Frank.

40:51.210 --> 40:53.170
Why would Frank
kill Hannah?

40:54.120 --> 40:56.540
What are you
keeping from me?

40:58.710 --> 41:01.000
I still love her.

41:02.830 --> 41:05.080
Why are you
doing this to me?

41:06.380 --> 41:08.620
'Cause I'm done
lying to you.

41:08.620 --> 41:11.080
And myself.

41:13.250 --> 41:18.750
I'll always love Laurel
for what she gave me...

41:18.750 --> 41:21.330
but it doesn't come close
to how much I love you.

41:25.620 --> 41:27.710
I mean it.

41:27.710 --> 41:30.620
With Laurel, it was...

41:30.620 --> 41:33.670
about feeling normal.

41:33.670 --> 41:36.620
But with you...

41:36.620 --> 41:41.040
the love I feel for you
and that y-you give back...

41:44.290 --> 41:46.830
...it's 'cause
I get to be me.

41:50.460 --> 41:52.000
Frank.

41:53.540 --> 41:55.170
Yeah?

41:57.620 --> 41:59.580
Hannah...

42:02.960 --> 42:05.290
She and Sam had a baby.

42:10.380 --> 42:12.250
A boy.
