00:17.801 --> 00:21.304
So I checked Waze, and it said it's,
like, 35 minutes to the airport.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.140
That seems, like, super quick, right?

00:25.643 --> 00:28.186
What's the matter? You okay?

00:28.271 --> 00:31.690
I still feel a little shaken up
from that fight the other day.

00:33.484 --> 00:36.988
I mean, it was a little weird, but...

00:38.656 --> 00:40.950
I'm willing to move through it.
Move past it.

00:42.368 --> 00:46.789
I just think it's... really hard,
'cause now you're going away.

00:46.872 --> 00:49.959
Yeah, but it's only gonna be,
like, 24 days.

00:50.042 --> 00:52.378
In the grand scheme of things,
that's not that long.

00:52.962 --> 00:55.506
I just really don't deal well
with separation, Gus.

00:56.006 --> 00:57.006
Oh.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.343
Uh... okay.

01:00.469 --> 01:04.640
Little scary to hear before we separate
for a month, but...

01:04.723 --> 01:07.559
I think what would help
is if we have a check-in plan.

01:08.018 --> 01:08.894
Sure.

01:08.977 --> 01:11.730
Yeah, whatever you need.
What... what are you thinking?

01:11.814 --> 01:12.856
Uh...

01:13.774 --> 01:16.109
Why don't you call me every day
when you're done with work?

01:16.193 --> 01:17.712
That way we don't have to think about it.

01:17.736 --> 01:19.947
Yeah, I guess I could call you,
probably...

01:20.030 --> 01:22.115
- Let's say 9:00 for me.
- Okay.

01:22.199 --> 01:25.285
Which would be, like, 6:00 for you.
That work?

01:25.369 --> 01:28.747
Yeah, and if I write you,
write me back quickly.

01:28.831 --> 01:30.874
- 'Cause I start to spin out.
- Sure.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.376
Sure, sure. Yeah, that's great.

01:32.460 --> 01:35.170
You take too long,
I'm gonna get on a plane to Atlanta.

01:35.253 --> 01:38.173
- [chuckles] Okay.
- Okay.

01:46.932 --> 01:48.559
I'm gonna miss you.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.018
I'll miss you, too.

01:51.562 --> 01:53.105
[Gus sighs]

01:53.188 --> 01:54.315
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:54.398 --> 01:56.233
- I don't want you to be late.
- All right.

01:57.860 --> 01:59.111
Thanks for the gift.

01:59.612 --> 02:00.863
Bye-bye.

02:23.301 --> 02:24.302
[scoffs]

02:26.555 --> 02:28.557
[theme music playing]

02:45.991 --> 02:46.992
[Arya] Help!

02:47.618 --> 02:48.827
[both grunting]

02:52.998 --> 02:54.708
[groans, screams]

02:58.962 --> 03:00.940
- [shrieks]
- You think your daddy's gonna save you

03:00.964 --> 03:02.364
just 'cause you're his little girl?

03:02.758 --> 03:03.759
No, he's gonna save me

03:03.842 --> 03:06.804
'cause he's the commander-in-chief
and I'm an American citizen.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.472
An American citizen.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.599
We know what America's all about.

03:10.683 --> 03:12.309
And the president's forgotten. [grunts]

03:12.393 --> 03:13.435
[Arya grunts]

03:25.072 --> 03:26.323
[Arya shrieks]

03:26.406 --> 03:28.158
- [Arya groans]
- [coughing]

03:30.368 --> 03:31.369
You forgot something.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.915
- What's that?
- You dropped this.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.668
- [gun fires]
- [Victor] And...

03:37.751 --> 03:38.919
cut.

03:39.002 --> 03:41.004
- [Victor claps]
- [woman] Cut, cut, cut.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.506
[indistinct whispering]

03:44.633 --> 03:46.427
Uh, great job, Arya.

03:46.510 --> 03:50.305
Victor wants to move on to a quick insert
of your finger on the trigger of the gun.

03:50.389 --> 03:52.057
No, I'm done. I'm tired.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.058
Okay.

03:56.479 --> 03:58.063
- She's great.
- [chuckles]

03:58.146 --> 04:00.315
Well, deep down,
she's a little sweetheart.

04:00.398 --> 04:02.693
Hey, just a reminder, Tommy, that, uh...

04:02.776 --> 04:05.529
after lunch she's only got, like,
two more hours left to film.

04:05.612 --> 04:06.488
- Yeah.
- So...

04:06.572 --> 04:08.049
I don't know
if you could let Victor know...

04:08.073 --> 04:10.451
- for me. Cool. Thanks, yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

04:11.827 --> 04:15.038
Um, and it doesn't have to be,
like, right now,

04:15.122 --> 04:17.082
but it's probably better
sooner than later.

04:17.165 --> 04:18.959
Oh, no, no, I'm sorry. Yeah, I will.

04:19.041 --> 04:22.087
It's just that I know he has, like,
12 things on his brain right now.

04:22.170 --> 04:23.589
- Of course. Yeah.
- Yeah, you know.

04:23.672 --> 04:24.757
- Definitely. Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.192
- He's got a tough job.
- [chuckles]

04:26.216 --> 04:27.342
- You, too.
- Oh.

04:27.425 --> 04:30.345
I see you running around set.
You're wearing all these different hats.

04:30.428 --> 04:31.788
- It's impressive. Respect.
- Yeah.

04:31.847 --> 04:33.140
[both chuckle]

04:33.223 --> 04:35.504
Well, I'm the president of development,
I guess. You know.

04:35.559 --> 04:38.562
I mean, I'm his assistant, and his...

04:38.646 --> 04:41.356
- translator, and his collaborator...
- Mmm-hmm.

04:41.439 --> 04:43.025
- therapist, at times.
- [laughs]

04:43.108 --> 04:44.860
- Life coach, I guess. Yeah.
- Wow.

04:44.943 --> 04:47.362
Very cool.
How long have you guys known each other?

04:47.445 --> 04:49.532
- About nine years. Yeah.
- [softly] Wow.

04:49.615 --> 04:51.825
Yeah, before that I worked at the UN.

04:52.535 --> 04:54.161
- United Nations. Yeah.
- Oh, sure.

04:54.244 --> 04:55.788
I don't know. It's cool, I guess.

04:55.871 --> 04:57.706
- [laughs]
- Yeah. No, I...

04:57.790 --> 05:00.333
- I spent most of my life in South Dakota.
- Oh, really?

05:00.417 --> 05:02.257
- I feel like a country mouse.
- Country mouse?

05:02.294 --> 05:03.754
- [laughs] That's...
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:04.755 --> 05:07.090
- Oh, hi.
- [both speaking Korean]

05:07.174 --> 05:09.551
- [Victor] Teacher.
- [speaking Korean]

05:09.635 --> 05:10.719
- Oh.
- Gus.

05:10.803 --> 05:11.843
- Victor. Victor.
- Victor.

05:11.887 --> 05:15.891
Hey, I just wanted to tell you,
I'm a huge fan of <i>The Sorting Fields.</i>

05:15.974 --> 05:17.810
I loved it. Action-packed. [chuckles]

05:17.893 --> 05:19.813
It has a good script.
We worked hard on that one.

05:19.895 --> 05:20.896
- A great script.
- Yeah.

05:20.979 --> 05:22.539
Can you let Victor know that I liked...

05:22.606 --> 05:24.900
- I don't know how to say...
- [speaking Korean]

05:24.983 --> 05:27.402
- I loved the movie or I'm a big fan.
- [speaking Korean]

05:27.485 --> 05:28.696
[stammers] Um...

05:29.655 --> 05:32.115
[whispering] Believe it or not,
he thinks that movie sucks.

05:32.199 --> 05:33.366
Oh.

05:33.450 --> 05:35.327
Yeah, he gets really upset
when I bring it up.

05:35.911 --> 05:38.496
- The last time he punched a grip, so...
- Oh.

05:38.581 --> 05:40.833
I mean, if you want me to,
I could tell him that...

05:40.916 --> 05:42.626
- No, please.
- It's probably better.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.729
- Keep that foot out of my mouth.
- You don't wanna see him mad.

05:44.753 --> 05:46.171
Thanks for looking out for me.

05:46.254 --> 05:47.505
- I got you.
- [chuckling]

05:47.590 --> 05:49.466
- [both speaking Korean]
- Okay.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.176
Thank you. Bye.

05:54.972 --> 05:56.012
[Mickey] Aren't you tired?

05:56.056 --> 05:58.225
Haven't you been up since, like,
6:30 in the morning?

05:58.308 --> 06:02.770
[Gus on phone] <i>Uh, I'm a little tired,
but I'm okay.</i>

06:02.854 --> 06:05.941
I'm, actually, uh...

06:06.650 --> 06:08.652
- [clicks tongue] a little horny.
- <i>Are you?</i>

06:08.736 --> 06:10.362
Should we do something about that?

06:11.530 --> 06:12.990
Oh, my God, seriously?

06:13.406 --> 06:15.533
That'd be awesome,
'cause I've never, uh...

06:15.618 --> 06:17.077
Well, never mind.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.620
You've never had phone sex?

06:19.204 --> 06:20.247
<i>No.</i>

06:20.330 --> 06:21.539
Well, now we have to.

06:21.624 --> 06:23.500
Yeah? All right.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.793
<i>Okay, sure. Yeah.</i>

06:25.877 --> 06:26.877
<i>I'm down.</i>

06:27.671 --> 06:28.671
Okay.

06:29.547 --> 06:31.049
- Get your dick out.
- <i>Okay.</i>

06:32.592 --> 06:34.594
Oh, um...

06:34.678 --> 06:37.514
Can you give me, like, one minute?
I just need total privacy.

06:37.597 --> 06:39.642
You're in a hotel room.
Don't you already have that?

06:39.725 --> 06:43.311
Yeah, but, uh, there's other people
who are here from the movie

06:43.395 --> 06:46.314
<i>who are staying at the hotel,
and I don't want them to...</i>

06:46.398 --> 06:48.025
- <i>Just... Sorry, one moment.</i>
- [sighs]

06:50.443 --> 06:52.362
- <i>Hang that up here...</i>
- [vibrator humming]

06:53.155 --> 06:55.157
Set the mood...

06:55.240 --> 06:57.701
- [vibrating continues]
- Okay. All right.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.871
All right. Now I'm ready.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.122
Are you hard?

07:02.205 --> 07:03.666
[sighs] Fuck.

07:03.749 --> 07:05.876
- What?
- I think I put the wrong tag on.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.878
All right. Just hurry, okay?

07:07.961 --> 07:09.922
<i>This train's leaving the station.</i>

07:11.298 --> 07:13.550
- [door rattling]
- <i>I did.</i>

07:13.634 --> 07:16.219
Good thing I checked.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.763
Okay.

07:17.846 --> 07:19.431
[humming]

07:25.478 --> 07:27.189
[exhales] All right.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.398
<i>Where were we?</i>

07:28.481 --> 07:29.942
Suck on my tits.

07:30.025 --> 07:31.068
[grunts]

07:32.069 --> 07:34.154
I miss you so much, Mickey.

07:34.237 --> 07:36.365
I wish I was there right now fucking you.

07:37.658 --> 07:38.659
[pants]

07:50.003 --> 07:53.757
She pulls in over 200,000 listeners
per week on this podcast

07:53.840 --> 07:56.051
where she talks about sex, from her bed.

07:56.134 --> 07:59.304
She gets huge stars, like, A-list.
She does one with Gwyneth Paltrow

07:59.387 --> 08:01.741
where Gwyneth talks about
giving a blow job for the first time.

08:01.765 --> 08:04.810
I actually went and bought her cookbooks.
I eat quinoa now.

08:05.394 --> 08:07.729
[Erika] If we could pull
someone like that in,

08:07.813 --> 08:11.149
I think the Subzero guys would really,
really love that.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.236
[Erika] Stella, hi!
We were just talking about you.

08:14.319 --> 08:16.529
- I'm Erika. Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

08:16.613 --> 08:18.824
Oop! Red rover. [chuckles] Here I come.

08:18.907 --> 08:22.035
Next week, Nicki Minaj is gonna be on,
and I'm just like, "What is happening?"

08:22.119 --> 08:24.162
I've been obsessed
with her boobs since I was 15.

08:24.246 --> 08:25.497
Stella, it's pretty simple.

08:25.580 --> 08:28.500
I mean, everybody at Gravity
just loves this podcast,

08:28.583 --> 08:31.294
and, yeah, we wanna help you
take this to the next level.

08:31.378 --> 08:34.422
Well, I'm kinda happy
with the level I'm at.

08:34.506 --> 08:36.466
You know,
I like talking about whatever I want.

08:36.549 --> 08:38.068
You know?
I wanna be able to talk about

08:38.135 --> 08:41.096
how I texted a picture of my asshole
to a guy after our first date once.

08:41.179 --> 08:42.698
[Mickey] You can talk about that here.

08:42.722 --> 08:46.518
You should talk about why they call
female orgasms "coming."

08:46.601 --> 08:49.354
Because it makes women feel
like they should just be squirting

08:49.437 --> 08:53.108
streams of vaginal fluid
every time they fuck.

08:53.191 --> 08:55.360
- [both laughing]
- Wait, can I use that?

08:55.443 --> 08:57.445
- Yeah.
- [Erika chuckles]

08:57.529 --> 08:58.529
[laughs]

08:58.947 --> 09:01.742
[stammers] Yeah, I had made
that observation before.

09:01.825 --> 09:04.995
That's an observation I've made before.
Uh...

09:05.078 --> 09:09.041
Hey, uh, Mickey, why don't you take
Stella on, like, a tour of the station?

09:09.124 --> 09:11.209
- Sure. Yeah, I can do that.
- Sweet.

09:11.293 --> 09:13.003
- Thanks.
- [Erika] Great.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.926
- [Stella] Bye, guys.
- [Truman] Miss you guys.

09:14.963 --> 09:16.423
Bye, have fun!

09:16.924 --> 09:18.804
[man] You guys know
what your next movie is yet?

09:18.884 --> 09:22.304
We're thinking about this project
about Arctic explorers.

09:22.387 --> 09:23.931
But the script isn't there yet.

09:24.014 --> 09:25.098
- Nice.
- It's pretty cool.

09:25.182 --> 09:26.183
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

09:26.266 --> 09:27.267
That sounds cool.

09:27.350 --> 09:29.978
- Did you say Arctic explorers?
- Yeah.

09:30.062 --> 09:33.398
Did you read that article
about this island up north that's, like,

09:33.482 --> 09:35.776
basically where World War III
is gonna start?

09:36.777 --> 09:38.695
- Let's assume we haven't.
- Oh!

09:38.779 --> 09:39.822
Oh, my God.

09:39.905 --> 09:42.074
It's amazing, 'cause the...

09:42.157 --> 09:44.242
Well, you know,
the polar ice caps are melting,

09:44.326 --> 09:47.913
so now these, like, new islands are
kind of forming up in the North Pole.

09:47.996 --> 09:50.123
So there's this island
and everybody's fighting over,

09:50.207 --> 09:52.167
like, whose island is it, you know?

09:52.250 --> 09:55.045
So you got, like,
people from China on the island...

09:55.128 --> 09:58.256
America, Russia, everybody.
Everybody's just up there.

09:58.340 --> 10:00.092
- [Victor speaking Korean]
- And they're...

10:00.175 --> 10:02.260
- saying it's their island.
- [Tommy translating]

10:02.344 --> 10:04.096
So you got, like, 60 people up there...

10:04.179 --> 10:07.140
half are scientists, half are soldiers,
which is...

10:07.224 --> 10:09.267
[speaking Korean]

10:10.227 --> 10:11.812
I'm sorry, I don't... What?

10:11.895 --> 10:13.355
- He said 30 and 30.
- Yeah.

10:13.438 --> 10:14.772
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:14.857 --> 10:17.860
Half are soldiers, half are scientists.
Thirty-thirty. Yeah.

10:17.943 --> 10:20.445
And there's this one guy there, Jassanik.

10:20.528 --> 10:22.530
He's, like, the American guy up there.

10:22.614 --> 10:25.117
And if you looked at him,
he looks exactly like Jason Statham.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.952
- Jason Statham.
- Yeah.

10:27.035 --> 10:28.536
It's like a spitting image of him.

10:28.620 --> 10:30.580
- It's crazy, this guy Jassanik.
- Okay.

10:32.040 --> 10:34.126
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah. You're welcome.

10:34.209 --> 10:36.586
- Hey, got a sec?
- Sure. What's up?

10:36.669 --> 10:42.050
I don't think this is really the place
to try and pitch Victor your movie.

10:42.133 --> 10:45.512
Oh, I wasn't pitching, I...
I was talking about an article I liked.

10:45.595 --> 10:49.057
- Yeah, I know, but, uh...
- He seemed kind of interested. I don't...

10:49.141 --> 10:51.434
Well... yeah.
He fakes interest to be polite.

10:51.518 --> 10:54.646
And I try to keep people away
so he doesn't have to be a jerk.

10:54.729 --> 10:55.730
- Oh.
- So...

10:55.813 --> 10:57.649
I mean, if it's cool,
just stay in your lane.

10:57.732 --> 11:00.110
You know, teach the kid her ABC's,
if that's cool.

11:00.610 --> 11:03.113
- Yeah. No, of course. I get it.
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.

11:06.116 --> 11:07.284
What do you wanna see first?

11:07.367 --> 11:11.454

who wears a bow tie every day?

11:11.538 --> 11:13.540
- Mason, please.
- Mmm-hmm. Obviously.

[Dr. Greg] Hey. Hello.
What's happening?

11:15.792 --> 11:17.419
Who's the stranger?

11:17.502 --> 11:20.172
Stella, this is Dr. Greg.
He has a show called <i>Heart Work.</i>

11:20.255 --> 11:22.299
Dr. Greg, this is Stella.

11:22.382 --> 11:25.593
She has an amazing podcast
about sex and relationships.

11:25.677 --> 11:28.013
And we're trying to get her
over here to Gravity.

11:29.181 --> 11:31.183
Stella. Terrific.

11:31.766 --> 11:33.435
A show about sex and relationships, huh?

11:34.144 --> 11:35.603
I would so welcome another person

11:35.687 --> 11:37.498
coming here and doing the work
I've been doing,

11:37.522 --> 11:39.399
because there's so much
that needs to be done.

11:39.482 --> 11:41.818
- Mmm.
- So many people that need our help.

11:41.901 --> 11:43.445
Are you familiar with my show?

11:43.528 --> 11:44.947
No, I only listen to podcasts.

Where'd you study broadcasting?

11:48.200 --> 11:50.327

- Whoa, he's terrifying!
- No.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.755
- [whispers] I fucked him.
- Ugh.

12:01.838 --> 12:04.299
But it was a power move,
so it doesn't count.

12:04.382 --> 12:05.758

I'm not doing a great job.

- Why, are you bored?
- Yeah.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.235
- [chuckles]
- Oh, super bored.

12:23.318 --> 12:26.196
Ugh, just tell me about it. Atlanta, man.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.322
It's the worst.

12:27.405 --> 12:30.325
And we're on the outskirts,
which is even rougher.

12:30.408 --> 12:34.037
Yeah, I think I'm really running out
of things to do here in this town.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.330
It's weird.

12:35.413 --> 12:38.291
If one more person tells me to go
to the World of Coca-Cola,

12:38.375 --> 12:40.251
- I'll blow my brains out.
- Yeah.

12:40.668 --> 12:42.087
I went there Sunday.

12:42.170 --> 12:44.714
I mean, I tried to,
but it was closed for renovations.

12:44.797 --> 12:47.259
So I just, like,
looked through the window.

12:47.342 --> 12:50.012
And it looked cool.
Some, like, cool memorabilia and stuff.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.267
Uh, what are you...
What are you up to tonight?

12:55.350 --> 12:58.978
'Cause I got some reservations
for this restaurant that I heard is good

12:59.062 --> 13:00.688
- called Oak and Hawk.
- Oh.

13:00.772 --> 13:04.567
- Could maybe bump it up from one to two.
- [chuckles] Think they could do that?

13:04.651 --> 13:06.903
Think they could move some things around?

13:06.986 --> 13:09.114
Uh, tonight's no good.

13:09.197 --> 13:12.492
That does sound fun, but I think
I just gotta chill, because I got...

13:12.575 --> 13:15.203
Sort of backloaded my day.
It's all tonight.

13:15.287 --> 13:18.665
I just figured, you know, you said
you're kind of bored and restless here.

13:18.748 --> 13:20.625
I'm bored and restless here,
so I thought...

13:20.708 --> 13:22.419
- Let's throw some more rocks.
- Okay.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.713

of the Robert Cohn character.

13:56.411 --> 13:59.497

this book was.

had a chance to read a lot.

14:23.271 --> 14:24.481
I don't know, homesick.

20:56.706 --> 20:57.707
[softly] Shit.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.417
Oh, hey, you're here.
Did you see what Gus sent?

21:00.502 --> 21:01.503
Oh, no.

21:02.504 --> 21:04.839
I thought maybe they were from Randy,
but they're not.

21:04.922 --> 21:06.215
- They're from Gus.
- Oh.

21:08.050 --> 21:09.051
Oh.

21:11.554 --> 21:12.972
That's a shit ton of flowers.

21:13.055 --> 21:14.825
Yeah. There's a card, too,
if you wanna read it.

21:14.849 --> 21:15.850
Okay.

21:17.769 --> 21:21.606
"Thirty roses for 30 days of sobriety.

21:21.689 --> 21:23.566
Here's to 30 more."

21:23.650 --> 21:24.776
Aw, that's so sweet.

21:24.859 --> 21:27.236
Well, congratulations, Mickey.
That's really great.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.740
"Here's to 30 more"?
Why does that sound vaguely threatening?

21:30.823 --> 21:31.824
I'm sure he meant well.

21:32.700 --> 21:35.912
You're right. I'm sorry. I'm just tired.
I'm gonna go lay down.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.126
Congratulations!

21:44.170 --> 21:45.963
Guess I'll just, uh...

21:46.047 --> 21:48.550
find somewhere to put these.

21:59.101 --> 22:00.186
[cell phone chimes]

22:11.781 --> 22:13.199
[sighs]

22:22.291 --> 22:23.811
[Tommy] It just makes things smoother.

22:23.876 --> 22:26.629
He has so much on his mind, it just...

22:26.713 --> 22:28.590
it will help the process, okay?

22:28.673 --> 22:31.425
- As far as the scripts are concerned...
- Hey, Tommy.

22:31.508 --> 22:34.178
Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

22:34.261 --> 22:35.638
- [Tommy] Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.556
- Uh, what's up?
- Hey, um...

22:37.640 --> 22:39.392
Just between you and me...

22:39.892 --> 22:41.393
I'm in this new relationship

22:41.477 --> 22:44.606
and it's just been
really tough being here...

22:44.689 --> 22:46.148
- away from her.
- Yeah.

22:46.232 --> 22:50.194
And I wanna work with Victor,
I totally do.

22:50.277 --> 22:54.073
It's just... It's hard for me
to get my mind around

22:54.156 --> 22:57.076
being in New York for a few weeks,
away from LA.

22:57.159 --> 22:59.578
It just doesn't sound
like an ideal situation.

22:59.662 --> 23:02.206
Yeah. Yeah. No. No. I totally get it.

23:02.290 --> 23:06.002
I'm going through the same shit, you know?
I'm away from my family. It's not easy.

23:06.085 --> 23:09.756
My wife is always like, "Victor is
the person you're in a relationship with."

23:09.839 --> 23:12.341
- [chuckles]
- And it sucks, 'cause it's true, you know?

23:12.424 --> 23:13.926
- Yeah. So you understand.
- Yeah.

23:14.010 --> 23:15.690
- Oh, totally. Totally.
- You get it. Yeah.

23:15.762 --> 23:18.097
I don't wanna say no to Victor...

23:18.180 --> 23:20.099
- but it's, I mean...
- Yeah. Yeah.

23:20.182 --> 23:22.644
You know him, is there any way
I can get through this?

23:22.727 --> 23:24.228
Yeah, okay. Well, how about this?

23:24.311 --> 23:26.605
Just tell Victor
that you're really into the project.

23:26.689 --> 23:28.691
- Mmm-hmm.
- And that you wanna do it by Skype.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.693
- It's like a no-brainer.
- Yeah?

23:30.777 --> 23:31.819
Yeah.

23:31.902 --> 23:36.490
My only worry is that he'll take that
as a sign that I'm not interested at all.

23:36.574 --> 23:38.468
- And I don't want that, 'cause I am.
- No. Yeah.

23:38.492 --> 23:40.119
No, totally not weird.

23:40.202 --> 23:42.371
He has family in Korea,
he Skypes all the time.

23:42.454 --> 23:43.622
Even if you went to New York,

23:43.706 --> 23:46.542
you'd most likely just be e-mailing stuff
back and forth anyway, so...

23:46.625 --> 23:47.794
- Right? Right.
- Yeah.

23:47.877 --> 23:49.597
How about this?
I'll help you smooth it out.

23:49.671 --> 23:51.673
Okay? I'll meet you
at Victor's trailer at lunch.

23:51.756 --> 23:52.799
- Okay.
- Yeah.

23:52.882 --> 23:54.091
- Thank you.
- We'll do it.

23:54.175 --> 23:55.176
Yeah. Gotcha.

- Hi.
- [sniffs]

24:22.494 --> 24:24.121

24:25.998 --> 24:28.918
- Yeah. Um...
- [speaking Korean]

24:29.001 --> 24:30.377
Tommy told me to come here.

24:30.461 --> 24:31.337
No.

24:31.420 --> 24:33.839
- Do you know where Tommy is?
- Ah, Tommy.

24:33.923 --> 24:36.092
Yeah, Tommy, you, me,
we were gonna all talk.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.634
- [speaking Korean]
- Oh.

24:38.803 --> 24:39.970
[speaking Korean]

24:41.013 --> 24:42.139
Okay.

24:42.223 --> 24:43.390
Sorry to wake you up.

24:43.474 --> 24:47.186
Tommy told me to swing by so we could
talk about the Arctic movie.

24:47.561 --> 24:48.396
Arctic movie?

24:48.479 --> 24:49.772
Yeah, and I just...

24:49.856 --> 24:52.056
I just wanted to go over
some scheduling stuff with you.

24:52.108 --> 24:53.400
Just real easy stuff.

24:53.484 --> 24:54.651
Um...

24:54.736 --> 24:55.862
[speaking Korean]

24:55.945 --> 24:58.239
I thought Tommy was gonna be here. Um...

24:58.322 --> 25:00.491
Hey, I got an idea.

25:00.574 --> 25:01.951
Do you know, um...

25:02.034 --> 25:04.746
Just do a little Google Translate here.

25:04.829 --> 25:06.998
I think that might help.

25:07.957 --> 25:11.668
I would like to write the movie...

25:11.753 --> 25:15.006
- [speaking Korean]
- I know. I know. I'm sorry.

25:15.089 --> 25:17.258
I just wish Tommy was here
to do this but, um...

25:17.341 --> 25:19.010
- Is this, um...
- [sighs heavily]

25:20.344 --> 25:22.554
- [Gus] Is that...
- Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

25:25.307 --> 25:26.767
Yes? Is that cool?

25:26.851 --> 25:27.852
Yeah?

25:28.352 --> 25:29.395
No.

25:29.478 --> 25:30.687
No Los Angeles.

25:31.272 --> 25:32.523
No Los Angeles.

25:32.606 --> 25:34.942
I don't think we should work together.

25:35.526 --> 25:36.819
[Tommy] Oh, shit, uh...

25:37.194 --> 25:38.195
[Victor] Tommy.

25:38.279 --> 25:41.490
Did you wake him? I am so sorry, I...

25:41.573 --> 25:43.450
He told me
that he was gonna be taking a nap.

25:43.534 --> 25:46.829
I completely forgot to tell you.
I feel like an asshole.

25:46.913 --> 25:49.123
- Oh, gosh.
- Are you serious?

25:50.291 --> 25:51.292
Tommy, come on.

25:51.375 --> 25:52.418
What?

25:52.501 --> 25:54.754
I can't help but think
you maybe set me up here.

25:55.254 --> 25:58.465
[chuckles] No, man. I like you, man.
I would never do that.

25:58.549 --> 26:00.134
- You didn't mean to set me up?
- No.

26:00.217 --> 26:03.595
I feel sick to my stomach right now,
'cause I made a horrible mistake.

26:03.679 --> 26:05.399
- I'm so sorry.
- Let's talk about it later.

26:05.431 --> 26:07.058
- Sure. Sure.
- Victor, I'm so sorry.

26:07.141 --> 26:09.018
Let's...
Can we hash this out some other time?

26:09.101 --> 26:11.520
- I... No... [sighs]
- [Tommy] Gus, you should probably...

26:11.603 --> 26:14.523
- Yeah, he's gonna finish his nap.
- What?

26:14.606 --> 26:16.067
He hates when people wake him up.

26:16.150 --> 26:20.321
Um, Tommy, I'm just wondering,
how do you say "fuck you" in Korean?

26:21.363 --> 26:23.199
[in Korean accent] Fuck you.

26:23.991 --> 26:25.993
No, I meant, just...

26:27.203 --> 26:28.204
Shit!

26:31.207 --> 26:33.459
[Stella] Why do you even want me so bad?

26:33.876 --> 26:35.711
I just like things the way they are.

26:35.794 --> 26:37.839
It could just be you and me.

26:37.922 --> 26:40.424
That's why I wanted you to come in
after work hours.

26:40.507 --> 26:42.509
We can record whenever you want.

26:42.593 --> 26:44.887
We can do whatever we want.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.263
Nobody gives a fuck.

26:46.347 --> 26:48.224
I just wanna do my show in my pajamas.

26:48.307 --> 26:51.560
I wanna do everything in my pajamas,
but it's gonna get old.

26:51.643 --> 26:55.106
Do you wanna be 40 and talking about
how you blew the Postmates guy?

26:55.189 --> 26:56.648
I don't wanna be 40.

26:57.608 --> 27:00.069
I listened to you talk for 30 minutes

27:00.152 --> 27:02.363
about how you texted a guy
a picture of your butthole.

27:02.446 --> 27:06.533
And it was super funny,
but what's that about? Like...

27:06.617 --> 27:08.535
What's behind the butthole?

27:08.619 --> 27:10.955
- [chuckles] Ew.
- Seriously, though.

27:11.038 --> 27:14.166
You have to think about that
at some point, right?

27:14.250 --> 27:17.753
Why you're doing this shit is
as interesting as the shit you're doing.

27:18.420 --> 27:22.925
Okay, take me for a messed-up example.

27:23.009 --> 27:25.929
This guy I'm seeing, he's in Atlanta
right now, so we're having phone sex.

27:25.970 --> 27:28.472
And that's fun.
People love hearing about phone sex.

27:28.555 --> 27:30.391
But here's what's actually interesting.

27:30.474 --> 27:33.644
I make him call me every night
at 6:00 p.m. sharp

27:33.727 --> 27:36.188
and he has to text me back
within 30 minutes.

27:36.272 --> 27:38.524
Oh, so you're a crazy person.

27:38.607 --> 27:42.319
A thousand percent, but isn't he crazy,
too, for going along with it?

27:42.403 --> 27:44.989
- I don't know, maybe he loves you.
- Well, he shouldn't.

27:45.072 --> 27:47.658
- I mean, that's messed up, too.
- [chuckles]

27:47.741 --> 27:50.411
Listen, I can make your show
fucking awesome.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.204
Just come work with me.

27:52.288 --> 27:53.747
Let's do this shit.

27:55.791 --> 27:57.584
- Okay, fuck it. I'm in.
- Great.

27:57.668 --> 27:59.420
- Let's make it good.
- Okay.

27:59.503 --> 28:02.589
So what did the guy write back when
you sent him the picture of your butthole?

28:02.673 --> 28:03.715
Oh, nothing.

28:03.799 --> 28:05.801
I got nothing for two weeks.

28:05.884 --> 28:07.929
And then he sent me
a cringe face that said,

28:08.012 --> 28:09.513
"Hey, I'm gonna pass."

28:11.933 --> 28:14.602

enough stories from you guys</i>

<i>Come on. Anything will do.</i>

28:28.699 --> 28:31.159
<i>Did you fall for your UberX driver
and invite him up?</i>

28:31.243 --> 28:34.080
<i>An orgy in an Uber pool
would be awesome to hear about.</i>

28:34.163 --> 28:35.748
<i>Whatever you got, tweet at me.</i>

[Skype call ringing]

28:49.595 --> 28:52.139
- Hey, there you are.
- <i>Hi.</i>

28:52.223 --> 28:54.641
Yeah, sorry, I've been tired
and stressed and...

28:54.725 --> 28:56.352
- I don't know.
- <i>Oh, that's okay.</i>

28:56.435 --> 28:58.229
I'm just happy to see your face.

28:58.312 --> 28:59.688
You, uh... you check your e-mail?

28:59.771 --> 29:01.857
- No, what was it?
- <i>You see it?</i>

29:01.941 --> 29:04.026
<i>I got you a plane ticket.</i>

29:04.110 --> 29:06.195
- <i>For this weekend.</i>
- Oh.

29:08.155 --> 29:11.158
- <i>maybe you could come out and see me.</i>
- "Connecting through Houston."

29:11.242 --> 29:12.243
Gus...

29:13.160 --> 29:14.453
why did you do that?

29:14.536 --> 29:17.706
I don't know.
'Cause I thought it'd be fun.

29:17.789 --> 29:20.792
You know, I got this hotel room.
I could show you around town.

29:20.876 --> 29:22.086
That's nice, but...

29:22.919 --> 29:24.796
you didn't even ask me if I could come.

29:24.880 --> 29:27.299
<i>I mean, I've got work. I'm busy.</i>

29:27.383 --> 29:29.843
We signed this podcaster.
I've got stuff to do.

29:30.427 --> 29:33.430
Think there's any way you could
maybe move stuff around?

29:33.514 --> 29:35.683
Make it work? You know, 'cause I'm...

29:36.266 --> 29:38.686
I'm just trying to prioritize
you and me stuff

29:39.020 --> 29:40.896
over work stuff here, so...

29:40.980 --> 29:43.357
Well, guess what?
I didn't ask you to do that.

29:43.440 --> 29:47.194
<i>It's no big deal,
but this director on this movie</i>

29:47.278 --> 29:50.197
<i>asked me if I wanted to come to New York
and work with him and...</i>

29:51.156 --> 29:55.494
I said no, because I thought
we'd wanna spend time together.

29:55.577 --> 29:57.830
What? Dude, that's amazing!

29:57.913 --> 30:00.457
- Why would I ever tell you not to go?
- <i>I know.</i>

30:00.541 --> 30:03.502
I'm just saying, I'm making sacrifices
to make this work.

30:03.585 --> 30:06.088
No. No, you don't get points...

30:06.172 --> 30:09.300
[scoffs] for something you decided
was a sacrifice in your head

30:09.383 --> 30:11.718
that I never would have asked you to do.

30:11.802 --> 30:13.387
Okay. Whatever.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.640
If you can't make it, don't come.
It's fine.

30:16.723 --> 30:18.600
I don't even know if I wanna come, Gus.

30:18.684 --> 30:19.684
Wow.

30:20.269 --> 30:24.148
Whatever happened to, uh, "Hey, Gus,
I don't do well with separation"?

30:24.231 --> 30:27.234
'Cause right now it sounds like you're
doing pretty fucking well without me.

30:27.318 --> 30:28.985
Now you're mad that I'm doing well?

30:29.070 --> 30:31.822
I told you I wanted to take
a year off of dating, remember?

30:31.905 --> 30:33.324
You're supposed to be happy for me.

30:33.407 --> 30:35.992
Do you want me to be just fucked up
'cause you're gone?

30:36.077 --> 30:38.704
God, I'm so sorry for being encouraging.

30:38.787 --> 30:40.914
I never dated anybody in the program,
all right?

30:40.997 --> 30:42.958
So I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.919
Then fucking go to an Al-Anon meeting,
dude.

30:46.712 --> 30:48.004
We've both got issues.

30:48.089 --> 30:50.132
I'm just the one
who's not afraid to admit it.

30:50.216 --> 30:51.675
Yes, Mickey, you're right.

30:51.758 --> 30:55.179
I am a huge asshole,
because I care about you.

30:55.262 --> 30:56.805
Whatever. Fuck this.

30:56.888 --> 30:58.599
Yeah, you're right, dude.
Fuck all of this.

30:58.682 --> 31:01.185
And I didn't read any of that
stupid fucking book anyway,

31:01.268 --> 31:04.105
because I'm 32 and I don't want
any fucking homework assignment.

31:04.188 --> 31:05.564
<i>It's your loss, 'cause it's...</i>

31:05.647 --> 31:07.125
[distorting] <i>an amazing fucking book.</i>

31:07.149 --> 31:09.110
- What?
- I said it's your loss!

31:09.193 --> 31:10.736
Jesus fucking Christ!

31:10.819 --> 31:11.987
Fuck you!

31:20.204 --> 31:21.997
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't be so, uh...

31:23.457 --> 31:25.584
rigid about this schedule,

31:25.667 --> 31:28.295
because talking every day
isn't working for me anymore.

31:28.379 --> 31:30.172
No, it's not. You're right. Obviously.

31:30.256 --> 31:32.967
- Well, I'm gonna go, because...
- <i>Uh-huh. Okay. Whatever.</i>

31:33.049 --> 31:34.218
Fine. Bye.

31:35.302 --> 31:36.942
- [Skype call disconnects]
- [softly] Bye.

31:41.725 --> 31:42.726
[sighs]

31:42.810 --> 31:44.311
[guitar music playing]

32:19.721 --> 32:20.806
Hey.

32:21.682 --> 32:22.682
Hi.

32:23.058 --> 32:25.394
You, uh... remember Buster?

32:25.894 --> 32:26.894
Yeah.

32:29.106 --> 32:30.607
- Hi, Bust.
- [Buster sniffing]

32:31.775 --> 32:33.944
- He's happy to see you.
- Oh...

32:34.027 --> 32:36.905
Well, he just remembers all the treats
I used to sneak him.

32:37.489 --> 32:38.490
[chuckles]

32:40.826 --> 32:42.536
Still like my original name better.

32:43.412 --> 32:44.913
You can't name a dog Tom Skerritt.
