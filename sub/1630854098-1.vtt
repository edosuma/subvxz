00:41.292 --> 00:42.708
Céit!

00:47.625 --> 00:49.083
Céit!

00:58.333 --> 00:59.875
Céit!

01:08.125 --> 01:09.750
Where are you?

01:19.708 --> 01:21.500
Mam is looking for you!

01:30.792 --> 01:32.167
Céit!

01:35.417 --> 01:36.708
Céit!

01:48.833 --> 01:50.833
Céit, I'm warning you!

02:04.708 --> 02:08.083
Girls! Did you find her?

02:41.667 --> 02:43.667
There's muck on your shoes.

02:59.708 --> 03:05.542
The quiet girl

03:10.792 --> 03:14.292
Mam said the calf will be born
the same week as the baby.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.833
They will be twins!

03:17.042 --> 03:19.875
We'll have to pick a name for it.

03:20.083 --> 03:22.833
How does the calf
get into the mammy's belly?

03:23.042 --> 03:27.125
The bull pushes the calf into her.
Everyone knows that.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.417
Grainne, that's not how it happens.

03:29.625 --> 03:31.875
It is!
Fiona geraghty saw their bull...!

03:46.125 --> 03:49.917
- Fiona geraghty is an idiot.
- She's not an idiot!

04:08.042 --> 04:10.708
She hasn't made the lunches.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.208
"There was a sadness...

04:33.958 --> 04:36.167
"Upon the...

04:36.375 --> 04:37.958
People.

04:38.125 --> 04:39.542
"People...

04:40.458 --> 04:42.083
“..Who were...

04:46.625 --> 04:48.042
Left.

04:49.083 --> 04:50.667
"Left."

04:50.875 --> 04:53.042
Siobhan, continue reading.

04:53.208 --> 04:56.917
"But the king said
they were most welcome.

04:57.083 --> 04:59.958
"The prince was overjoyed.

05:00.167 --> 05:03.125
"They were travelling
on a great ship...“

05:47.875 --> 05:50.083
- Pick one.
- Green.

10:41.625 --> 10:43.208
Letter for you.

10:48.083 --> 10:49.792
Leave it on the table.

11:40.292 --> 11:42.125
Céit.

11:42.333 --> 11:43.750
Yes?

11:45.500 --> 11:46.917
Come here.

11:53.958 --> 11:55.375
Girls!

11:56.375 --> 11:58.083
Céit is leaving!

11:59.208 --> 12:00.875
Wait for us! We're coming!

15:02.917 --> 15:05.792
Well, look at this girl!

15:06.875 --> 15:10.083
Stand out so I can
have a proper look at you.

15:20.208 --> 15:23.708
The last time I saw you,
you were in the pram.

15:23.917 --> 15:25.417
Did you know that?

15:27.167 --> 15:31.583
- The pram is broken.
- What happened to it at all?

15:33.458 --> 15:38.417
My sisters used it as a wheelbarrow
and one of the wheels fell off.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.375
Come on in, child.

16:18.958 --> 16:21.583
Sit down if you'd like, pet.

16:21.792 --> 16:23.458
Make yourself at home.

16:27.958 --> 16:29.583
How is your mammy?

16:31.625 --> 16:33.875
She won ten pounds
on the prize bonds.

16:34.083 --> 16:35.958
She did not.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.833
She did. We had jelly.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.292
Wasn't that a treat?

16:49.583 --> 16:51.583
I'd say she's busy.

16:51.792 --> 16:53.167
Your mother?

16:54.375 --> 16:57.917
She's waiting for the men
to come and cut the hay.

16:58.417 --> 17:01.417
Have you not cut the hay yet?

17:03.208 --> 17:04.875
You're late.

17:07.416 --> 17:09.083
Are there any children here?

17:11.875 --> 17:15.375
There's only myself and Sean
in the house, pet.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.250
I have to pee.

20:44.792 --> 20:45.958
Now.

21:52.167 --> 21:54.125
Are you all right, love?

21:58.875 --> 22:02.625
Lord god, he left with
the poor girl's suitcase in the car.

22:19.292 --> 22:21.208
In you go.

22:23.958 --> 22:27.208
- It's hot.
- You'll get used to it.

23:00.750 --> 23:02.958
Now, your clothes.

23:04.958 --> 23:06.875
I don't have any clothes.

23:07.083 --> 23:10.250
Would some of our old things
do you for now?

23:10.458 --> 23:12.958
- I don't mind.
- Good girl.

23:25.625 --> 23:26.958
Now.

23:29.958 --> 23:33.750
My mam says
I have to change my pants every day.

23:34.958 --> 23:37.583
What else does your mother say?

23:39.333 --> 23:42.958
That you can keep me
for as long as you like.

23:45.208 --> 23:49.042
Now, will you come down
to the well with me?

23:50.083 --> 23:51.458
Now?

23:53.083 --> 23:54.958
Does now not suit you?

23:56.458 --> 23:58.250
Is it a secret?

23:59.708 --> 24:01.583
What?

24:02.708 --> 24:04.833
Am I not supposed to tell?

24:06.125 --> 24:08.917
There are no secrets in this house.

24:09.083 --> 24:10.917
Do you hear me?

24:14.333 --> 24:16.083
Do you hear me?

24:17.833 --> 24:20.083
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

24:20.250 --> 24:23.083
Yes, there are no secrets
in this house.

24:25.917 --> 24:29.875
If there are secrets in a house,
there is shame in that house.

24:31.500 --> 24:34.042
We don't want any shame here.

24:43.250 --> 24:45.250
You're too young to understand.

25:28.125 --> 25:29.750
Look at that.

25:29.958 --> 25:34.417
You wouldn't think
we've had no rain all month.

25:40.583 --> 25:42.208
Drink some.

25:47.208 --> 25:48.958
Now, be careful.

25:49.125 --> 25:50.750
It's deep.

26:34.125 --> 26:37.750
Now, do you want to bring
a cup of hot milk up with you?

26:39.208 --> 26:42.208
Mam doesn't let me drink anything
before bed.

26:43.250 --> 26:44.708
Well...

26:45.792 --> 26:48.042
We'll stick with mammy's way so.

26:49.792 --> 26:53.708
Sean, cait is going to bed.

26:54.417 --> 26:55.875
Good night.

26:59.083 --> 27:00.708
We'll go up.

27:11.833 --> 27:14.750
Oh, pardon me.
Would you prefer I left it open?

27:20.792 --> 27:22.583
Are you afraid of the dark?

27:27.375 --> 27:28.792
Don't mind me.

27:42.167 --> 27:44.208
Are you ok?

27:47.208 --> 27:49.250
Is your mammy ok?

27:51.167 --> 27:53.042
What do you mean?

27:53.208 --> 27:56.208
Your mammy, is she ok?

27:59.167 --> 28:04.542
She'd been throwing up until
recently, but she's stopped now.

28:11.625 --> 28:14.625
Why isn't the hay in?

28:17.125 --> 28:19.917
She doesn't have enough
to pay the man.

28:20.958 --> 28:22.417
God help her.

28:27.333 --> 28:30.625
Would she be offended
if I sent her some money?

28:32.958 --> 28:37.417
- Offended?
- Would she be cross?

28:38.708 --> 28:41.917
She wouldn't, but dad would.

28:44.208 --> 28:45.750
Your father.

28:50.750 --> 28:52.292
Goodnight, pet.

29:58.333 --> 29:59.958
God help you.

30:04.125 --> 30:05.958
If you were mine...

30:08.083 --> 30:11.458
I would never leave you
in a house with strangers.

30:36.583 --> 30:38.625
Did you sleep well, love?

30:44.625 --> 30:46.833
Lord god almighty.

30:47.042 --> 30:48.458
Look at that.

30:53.750 --> 30:57.833
These old mattresses.
They're always weeping.

30:58.042 --> 31:00.958
What was I thinking
putting you on one of these?

31:03.250 --> 31:05.208
Take off the pyjamas, good girl.

31:16.917 --> 31:19.250
It's time.

31:19.500 --> 31:23.333
Do you want to bring céit
with you today?

31:23.542 --> 31:25.500
Show her the farm?

31:25.708 --> 31:28.292
The work will be
a little difficult this week.

31:29.708 --> 31:32.333
- Will it?
- Another time, maybe.

31:40.750 --> 31:42.542
Well.

31:42.750 --> 31:44.125
If so...

31:46.375 --> 31:48.417
We'll begin.

32:00.708 --> 32:02.500
You need to be careful with it.

32:05.917 --> 32:07.750
Twenty-three...

32:08.750 --> 32:10.167
Twenty-four...

32:11.167 --> 32:12.583
Twenty-five...

32:13.958 --> 32:15.542
Twenty-six...

32:17.042 --> 32:18.417
Twenty-seven...

32:20.500 --> 32:21.958
Twenty-eight.

32:25.750 --> 32:27.667
It's a secret.

32:28.375 --> 32:32.583
Not many people know about it,
but it does wonders for the skin.

32:34.083 --> 32:37.708
Look at me, I haven't so much
as a pimple.

32:41.333 --> 32:44.375
I thought there were no secrets
in this house.

32:45.958 --> 32:47.667
Well...

32:47.875 --> 32:49.792
This is different.

32:50.958 --> 32:54.417
More like a secret recipe.

33:03.750 --> 33:05.292
Forty-three...

33:07.167 --> 33:08.708
Forty-four...

33:11.125 --> 33:12.792
Forty-five...

33:14.542 --> 33:16.125
Forty-six...

33:17.125 --> 33:18.542
Forty-seven.

33:19.542 --> 33:22.875
- Perishables?
- Food that doesn't last very long.

33:23.083 --> 33:25.792
You put them in here
and they stay as they are.

33:26.833 --> 33:29.667
- They don't grow old?
- Exactly.

33:31.875 --> 33:33.333
Like the land of youth?

33:34.958 --> 33:37.083
Like the land of youth!

33:52.208 --> 33:54.167
You're getting the hang of it.

33:56.875 --> 33:58.625
Careful of your hand.

34:01.958 --> 34:03.583
Excuse me.

34:13.292 --> 34:15.792
Hello? 72599...

34:22.208 --> 34:23.708
Ninety-four...

34:25.167 --> 34:26.875
Ninety-five...

34:27.958 --> 34:29.417
Ninety-six...

34:30.958 --> 34:32.333
Ninety-seven...

34:33.333 --> 34:34.417
Ninety-eight...

34:36.208 --> 34:37.708
Ninety-nine...

34:42.125 --> 34:43.792
One hundred.

34:49.708 --> 34:51.917
Your complexion is better already.

34:54.542 --> 34:57.792
All you needed was some minding.

35:18.458 --> 35:22.083
This game is crooked, girl.
I've been saying it for years.

35:22.292 --> 35:24.458
Quiet, you!

35:24.667 --> 35:27.042
Easy knowing whose purse
is running low!

35:27.208 --> 35:28.833
Is it any wonder?

35:29.042 --> 35:32.458
After twenty years
of being swindled by you lot!

35:32.667 --> 35:35.208
O cathasaigh,
haven't I said it before,

35:35.417 --> 35:37.667
misfortune followed you
from the cradle!

35:37.875 --> 35:40.333
Did your mother never tell you?

35:41.917 --> 35:45.958
"The ass" o cathasaigh.
The name well-earned.

35:46.125 --> 35:51.167
This girl must think that everyone
around here is mad, does she?

35:53.833 --> 35:57.292
- Who's winning? "The ass" I bet.
- Who else?

35:57.500 --> 36:00.083
And pigs might fly!

36:01.083 --> 36:03.583
You're after our pennies, are you?

36:03.792 --> 36:05.583
Selling tickets for the raffle.

36:05.792 --> 36:08.083
There's a new roof
going on the school.

36:08.917 --> 36:10.208
I wasn't sure...

36:10.417 --> 36:12.750
You don't have to have
children of your own

36:12.958 --> 36:16.083
to give shelter
to other people's children, do you?

36:16.250 --> 36:18.875
- You'll have a drink?
- I'll have a cup of tea.

36:19.625 --> 36:21.042
I'll get it.

36:28.833 --> 36:30.625
And who is this?

36:47.708 --> 36:49.292
Excuse me.

36:54.083 --> 36:56.583
Hello? 72599...

36:57.958 --> 37:00.125
Ah, hello sinéad.

37:01.958 --> 37:05.292
You don't say! Your poor father!

37:09.458 --> 37:11.708
Of course, I'll head over to you now.

37:18.875 --> 37:22.958
There's ham and coleslaw in
the fridge for lunch if I'm not back.

37:23.167 --> 37:26.125
We won't die of the hunger anyway.

37:31.042 --> 37:34.667
My mam says I'll get pneumonia
if I don't wear my jumper.

37:34.875 --> 37:36.208
Now.

37:37.167 --> 37:39.792
Maybe the old man
wasn't wearing his jumper.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.250
Maybe.

37:42.792 --> 37:45.375
Why is mrs kinsella
looking after him?

37:46.875 --> 37:49.458
She's helping his daughter.

37:49.667 --> 37:52.125
It's the daughter
who's looking after him.

37:55.625 --> 37:58.417
Don't you help your neighbours out
now and then?

37:59.458 --> 38:01.083
I don't know.

39:32.958 --> 39:34.333
Céit!

39:42.167 --> 39:43.458
Céit!

39:44.958 --> 39:46.167
Céit!

39:57.583 --> 40:00.792
You can't go wandering off like that,
do you hear me?

40:02.083 --> 40:03.792
Do you hear me?

40:27.792 --> 40:29.167
Sean.

40:30.292 --> 40:32.833
Céit is going to bed.

40:33.042 --> 40:34.417
Good night.

41:56.917 --> 41:59.083
How are you getting on, love?

42:53.792 --> 42:56.250
- Is that the mother's milk?
- No.

42:57.583 --> 42:59.875
- What is it then?
- Powdered milk.

43:00.917 --> 43:03.667
Why don't you give him
his mother's milk?

43:03.875 --> 43:05.667
We sell that milk.

43:07.833 --> 43:12.042
- Why doesn't the calf get any?
- He does, in the beginning.

43:12.208 --> 43:13.833
For how long?

43:15.125 --> 43:16.708
Long enough!

43:18.042 --> 43:20.292
Why don't we drink the powdered milk

43:20.500 --> 43:22.917
and leave the cows
to drink their own?

43:23.083 --> 43:25.292
Here, you do it.

44:13.667 --> 44:16.167
- Can you run?
- What?

44:16.375 --> 44:18.750
You have long legs.
Are you fast?

44:18.958 --> 44:20.333
Sometimes.

44:20.542 --> 44:23.500
Run down the Lane
to the box and back.

44:23.708 --> 44:25.708
- What box?
- The post box.

44:25.917 --> 44:29.167
I forgot it this morning.
See if there's anything in it.

44:29.375 --> 44:32.042
Off you go. I'll time you.

44:34.958 --> 44:36.458
Off you go!

46:04.792 --> 46:07.375
You've never had red gooseberry jam?

46:07.958 --> 46:09.750
I haven't.

46:09.958 --> 46:11.917
You're in for a treat so.

46:28.250 --> 46:29.667
Good girl.

46:34.875 --> 46:37.333
It's past time
we did something about this.

46:43.208 --> 46:44.917
What's wrong with her?

46:45.083 --> 46:49.292
Tomorrow is Sunday and I won't let
her go to mass like that again.

46:49.500 --> 46:52.292
Isn't she clean and neat?

46:52.500 --> 46:54.917
You know what I'm talking about,
eibhlin.

46:59.708 --> 47:03.625
Run upstairs, get yourself ready
and I'll bring us into town.

47:40.083 --> 47:43.083
You should wash your hands and face
before going into town.

47:43.833 --> 47:46.917
Didn't your father bother
to teach you that much even?

48:01.958 --> 48:03.333
One minute.

48:17.083 --> 48:19.708
Sorry to have kept you.

48:23.125 --> 48:26.167
It will be nice
to have your own clothes.

48:28.333 --> 48:30.208
And the town is nice.

48:31.958 --> 48:36.250
I don't know why I didn't think
of taking you in before now.

48:52.708 --> 48:55.083
You can buy a choc ice for yourself.

48:57.875 --> 49:01.292
She could buy
half a dozen choc ices with that.

49:01.500 --> 49:04.583
What good is it having her here
if we can't spoil her?

49:05.958 --> 49:07.792
What do you say?

49:07.958 --> 49:10.167
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

49:12.500 --> 49:13.917
We'll go.

49:52.042 --> 49:54.042
Nine pounds, ten ounces.

49:54.208 --> 49:57.125
- She was big in the end.
- You can say that again!

49:57.333 --> 50:00.458
She's beautiful.
Your mother must be mad about her.

50:00.667 --> 50:02.750
She's very taken with her.

50:02.958 --> 50:06.167
What about cian?
Is he good with her?

50:07.208 --> 50:09.333
He's getting used to her!

50:10.958 --> 50:13.042
It takes time, I suppose.

50:18.250 --> 50:20.417
And who's this girl? Whose is she?

50:21.500 --> 50:24.583
This is céit.
She's my cousin's daughter.

50:24.792 --> 50:26.833
She's staying with us for the summer.

50:28.083 --> 50:29.958
Can she be put to work?

50:31.667 --> 50:34.625
She'll put her hand to anything.

50:34.833 --> 50:38.833
Well, isn't she company for you
all the same, god help you.

50:59.667 --> 51:02.042
Sinéad, is everything ok?

51:03.042 --> 51:05.250
It's dad, he's gone.

51:06.250 --> 51:08.500
Oh sinéad, I'm so sorry.

51:11.542 --> 51:15.083
Very sorry for your loss, sinéad.
If there's anything we can do.

51:26.417 --> 51:28.667
- Where's he gone?
- Sean?

51:30.125 --> 51:32.292
He's helping the family.

51:33.458 --> 51:35.458
Were you ever at a wake?

51:36.625 --> 51:38.458
I don't think so.

51:38.708 --> 51:41.625
Well, there will be a dead man
in a coffin.

51:41.833 --> 51:44.792
You probably never saw
a dead person before, did you?

51:45.792 --> 51:48.333
I did, on the news.

51:50.042 --> 51:53.250
You probably did, god help you.

51:53.458 --> 51:57.875
But it's a different thing
having them there in front of you.

52:11.833 --> 52:13.458
Don't be afraid.

52:34.500 --> 52:35.917
He's praying.

52:37.083 --> 52:39.500
We have to say a prayer for him too.

52:40.833 --> 52:43.125
Bye for now, Sean.

52:45.208 --> 52:49.250
- There she is, the long-legged girl.
- Eibh||'n, love!

52:51.167 --> 52:52.583
Come here.

52:55.958 --> 52:59.083
Isn't that a lovely dress?

52:59.292 --> 53:01.083
You got that today, did you?

53:03.792 --> 53:05.583
Do you want a sip?

53:17.458 --> 53:19.542
- Do you like it?
- No.

53:20.792 --> 53:25.667
Don't get a taste for it either or
you'll end up like these drunkards.

53:34.458 --> 53:35.792
Now.

53:49.083 --> 53:52.042
She's getting restless,
the poor creature.

53:53.708 --> 53:56.875
I can bring her home with me
if you'd like?

53:57.083 --> 53:58.833
I'll be leaving now.

53:59.167 --> 54:01.083
Oh, I don't know.

54:03.042 --> 54:05.125
My gang can play with her.

54:09.750 --> 54:12.292
Maybe. What harm?

54:13.292 --> 54:15.625
- If you don't mind.
- It's nothing.

54:19.875 --> 54:22.500
They're looking after you well,
isuppose.

54:22.708 --> 54:24.083
Yes.

54:24.292 --> 54:26.833
Tell me,
what room did they put you in?

54:27.958 --> 54:29.958
The one beside the toilet.

54:31.083 --> 54:33.667
Does he give you pocket money?
Kinsella?

54:34.667 --> 54:38.583
- He gave me money today.
- Weren't you lucky?

54:39.208 --> 54:41.167
- How much?
- A pound.

54:43.542 --> 54:45.792
Is herself allowed to spend?

54:46.792 --> 54:49.250
- Who?
- Eibhl|'n, you dope!

54:51.625 --> 54:53.833
And she's still drinking, I suppose?

54:54.833 --> 54:56.875
When visitors come.

54:57.083 --> 55:02.125
- Do they have many visitors?
- They had a card game last week.

55:02.333 --> 55:04.083
Who was there?

55:04.250 --> 55:07.375
Two men. And another man
who came selling lines.

55:07.583 --> 55:10.250
- Lines?
- To put a roof on the school.

55:11.542 --> 55:13.625
Do you say the rosary?

55:15.750 --> 55:19.792
- She's baking the whole time, is she?
- She is.

55:19.958 --> 55:22.417
- Butter or margarine?
- What?

55:22.625 --> 55:25.750
- In her pastry!
- Butter.

55:27.333 --> 55:30.625
Does she have the freezer
packed to the brim?

55:30.833 --> 55:32.458
Yes.

55:32.667 --> 55:35.583
- Where does the dog sleep?
- In the shed.

55:35.792 --> 55:38.667
- Not in the house?
- I've never seen him there.

55:39.667 --> 55:43.458
And are the child's clothes
still hanging in the wardrobe?

55:44.958 --> 55:48.167
- The child's clothes?
- Yes.

55:48.375 --> 55:52.458
If you're sleeping in his room,
you must know.

55:52.667 --> 55:54.958
Did n't you look?

55:55.125 --> 55:58.167
Well, she had clothes for me

55:58.417 --> 56:02.542
but we went into town
and bought new ones.

56:03.833 --> 56:07.542
- This rig-out you're wearing?
- I like them.

56:07.750 --> 56:10.292
The shop lady
said they were flattering.

56:11.958 --> 56:13.750
'Flattering', is it?

56:13.958 --> 56:15.333
Well...!

56:16.333 --> 56:20.750
Well, I suppose, after wearing the
dead's clothes for the past month.

56:25.292 --> 56:26.958
You didn't know?

56:27.958 --> 56:29.458
About what?

56:30.458 --> 56:32.833
The kinsellas' boy, you dope.

56:36.958 --> 56:40.208
It must have been some
head of cabbage they found you under.

56:43.292 --> 56:45.083
What happened to him?

56:46.083 --> 56:49.583
Didn't he follow the dog
into the slurry pit...

56:50.750 --> 56:52.833
And didn't he drown, the poor boy.

56:54.208 --> 56:56.083
That's what they say anyway.

56:57.875 --> 57:00.250
They say Sean got the gun

57:00.458 --> 57:04.083
and took the dog down the field
to kill it...

57:05.083 --> 57:09.167
But he hadn't the heart
to shoot it, the soft-hearted fool.

57:11.333 --> 57:17.333
Do you know poor eibhlin's hair
turned white overnight afterwards?

57:18.458 --> 57:21.792
- But her hair is brown.
- Brown?!

57:23.542 --> 57:25.458
Out of the dye-pot,

57:25.667 --> 57:27.083
you can be sure!

57:52.958 --> 57:54.417
There weren't many there.

57:54.667 --> 57:58.792
A mound of sandwiches still
on the table when I was leaving.

58:00.125 --> 58:01.958
They had raisin scones

58:02.167 --> 58:04.792
and some sort
of an attempt at a trifle.

58:06.250 --> 58:09.875
And poor gearoid
lying crooked in the coffin

58:10.083 --> 58:13.042
without a proper shave even.

58:13.208 --> 58:14.917
Shameful!

58:15.083 --> 58:17.667
And plastic rosary beads
in his hands,

58:17.875 --> 58:20.083
the poor wretch.

58:22.083 --> 58:26.250
Shut your traps in there!
I'm trying to talk to your granny!

58:36.208 --> 58:39.208
- Hello all.
- Sean, you were quick.

58:39.417 --> 58:43.625
We're only in the door.
Aren't we, girl?

58:44.625 --> 58:47.750
Thank you, una.
It was good of you to take her home.

58:48.958 --> 58:51.917
A quiet girl, this one.

58:52.083 --> 58:54.292
She says as much as she needs to say.

58:55.708 --> 58:59.042
May there be many like her.
Are you ready, pet?

59:23.083 --> 59:25.750
Were you ok in there?

59:25.958 --> 59:26.958
Yes.

59:29.833 --> 59:31.958
Did she ask you any questions?

59:33.833 --> 59:36.042
A few things, not much.

59:39.750 --> 59:41.500
What did she ask you?

59:43.417 --> 59:47.667
She asked me if you used
butter or margarine in your pastry.

59:53.417 --> 59:55.250
Did she ask you anything else?

01:00:07.083 --> 01:00:08.875
What did she tell you?

01:00:12.083 --> 01:00:13.458
Girl.

01:00:15.083 --> 01:00:18.583
She told me that you had a little boy

01:00:18.792 --> 01:00:21.083
who followed the dog
into the slurry pit...

01:00:22.083 --> 01:00:23.708
And died.

01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:34.083
And that I was wearing his clothes
for the past month.

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:54.875
We'll go out.

01:02:34.833 --> 01:02:36.833
Someone's horse is missing tonight.

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:42.458
It's a stable door.

01:02:52.333 --> 01:02:56.458
Do you know, fishermen sometimes
find horses out at sea?

01:02:59.667 --> 01:03:01.833
I know a man

01:03:02.042 --> 01:03:04.083
who towed a Colt in one time.

01:03:06.958 --> 01:03:10.167
And the horse lay on the strand

01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:13.500
for a long, long time...

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.708
Like he was fit to die.

01:03:18.333 --> 01:03:22.042
Until he suddenly stood up, revived.

01:03:25.125 --> 01:03:27.083
He was ok?

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:29.458
Good as new.

01:03:29.667 --> 01:03:31.083
Perfect.

01:03:40.208 --> 01:03:42.917
Strange things happen sometimes,
don't they?

01:03:49.417 --> 01:03:52.417
Something strange
happened to you tonight.

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:58.417
But eibhlin didn't mean any harm.

01:04:03.083 --> 01:04:06.125
She wants to find
the good in other people...

01:04:07.458 --> 01:04:09.750
Hoping she won't be disappointed...

01:04:12.625 --> 01:04:14.792
But sometimes she is.

01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:29.833
You don't have to say anything.

01:04:33.208 --> 01:04:34.958
Always remember that.

01:04:37.958 --> 01:04:40.917
Many's the person missed
the opportunity to say nothing...

01:04:42.083 --> 01:04:44.500
And lost much because of it.

01:05:14.583 --> 01:05:15.708
Céit?

01:05:32.083 --> 01:05:33.458
Look!

01:05:39.625 --> 01:05:41.417
There are three lights now.

01:07:05.583 --> 01:07:08.083
Keep your finger under the words.

01:07:15.417 --> 01:07:17.500
I'm coming!

01:07:19.625 --> 01:07:21.208
I'm going to win!

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:32.457
Ten seconds faster
than the first time you did that.

01:09:32.667 --> 01:09:34.957
Like a gust of wind you are, girl.

01:09:36.207 --> 01:09:40.292
Now, do you think there's any money
in any of these?

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.207
I don't know.

01:09:43.207 --> 01:09:45.042
A wedding invite maybe.

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.167
Will you marry someday, do you think?

01:09:51.207 --> 01:09:53.750
Mam says men
aren't worth bothering with.

01:09:55.125 --> 01:09:57.292
Maybe she's right.

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.208
That being said,
we're not all the same.

01:10:01.208 --> 01:10:05.958
But this is certain, whatever fella's
to catch you, he'll have to be fast.

01:10:15.958 --> 01:10:17.333
My mam?

01:10:21.292 --> 01:10:23.333
It's addressed to eibhlin.

01:10:30.083 --> 01:10:32.958
Well, you have a new brother.

01:10:33.667 --> 01:10:35.875
Eight pounds, six ounces.

01:10:36.875 --> 01:10:39.458
- Great.
- Don't be like that.

01:10:43.958 --> 01:10:46.625
And school is starting again
on Monday.

01:10:48.208 --> 01:10:50.958
Your mam wants us to bring you home

01:10:51.125 --> 01:10:54.083
so she can get you ready.

01:10:55.375 --> 01:10:57.250
I have to go back then?

01:11:00.083 --> 01:11:01.625
Yes.

01:11:01.833 --> 01:11:04.958
But you knew that, didn't you?

01:11:10.042 --> 01:11:15.958
You couldn't stay here
with old fogies like us, could you?

01:11:26.292 --> 01:11:28.083
Come here, child.

01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:35.458
It'll be alright, love.

01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:17.458
- You'll have a glass of orange, pet?
- Please.

01:13:22.708 --> 01:13:24.083
The water is low.

01:13:24.292 --> 01:13:27.042
I'll have to go down to the well
when you're gone.

01:13:39.667 --> 01:13:42.958
- Where's himself?
- He's milking the cows below.

01:13:53.333 --> 01:13:56.375
- What hurry is on himself?
- He needs help pulling a calf.

01:13:56.583 --> 01:13:59.458
Do you mind finishing down below?
I have the herd out.

01:13:59.667 --> 01:14:01.667
- Of course.
- I'll be back as soon as I can.

01:14:16.042 --> 01:14:17.833
I won't be long, dear.

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:20.625
Céit?

01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:52.250
Oh Christ!

01:16:54.667 --> 01:16:56.250
Oh, my love!

01:17:01.708 --> 01:17:03.125
You're frozen.

01:17:08.667 --> 01:17:13.042
- What will we say to her mother?
- We won't say a word to her mother.

01:17:13.208 --> 01:17:16.958
- It's just a little cold she has.
- She's expecting her at home.

01:17:17.167 --> 01:17:20.083
What harm if we hang on to her
for another day or two?

01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:23.458
When I think
of what could have happened.

01:17:23.667 --> 01:17:26.792
If you've said that once,
you've said it a hundred times!

01:17:26.958 --> 01:17:31.125
- But...!
- But nothing happened, she's fine.

01:17:32.667 --> 01:17:36.708
We'll bring her home at the weekend
and that's the end of it.

01:17:44.375 --> 01:17:47.500
I don't know if I had those potatoes
boiled right at all.

01:17:50.542 --> 01:17:52.583
I wouldn't find any fault with them.

01:19:36.292 --> 01:19:39.833
That's where dad lost our red heifer
in a game of cards.

01:19:41.417 --> 01:19:43.042
You don't say?

01:19:46.417 --> 01:19:48.375
Wasn't that some wager?

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:54.500
Mam didn't speak to him
for a month aftenivards.

01:21:40.625 --> 01:21:42.167
You've grown.

01:21:43.292 --> 01:21:44.708
I have.

01:21:45.708 --> 01:21:47.500
Now, watch that.

01:21:47.708 --> 01:21:49.708
Eibhlin.

01:21:49.917 --> 01:21:51.750
- Sean.
- Maire, my love.

01:21:51.958 --> 01:21:55.083
- How are you?
- It's a long time since I saw you.

01:21:55.292 --> 01:21:59.917
Come in and have a seat
if you can find a chair.

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:02.333
- You'll have a cup of tea?
- We will.

01:22:16.625 --> 01:22:20.292
I brought some jam. Don't let me
leave without giving it to you.

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:23.917
I made this from the rhubarb
you sent down to me.

01:22:24.083 --> 01:22:25.833
That's the last of it.

01:22:26.042 --> 01:22:29.708
I should have brought more rhubarb
with me, I wasn't thinking.

01:22:36.875 --> 01:22:38.750
Where's the new baby?

01:22:38.958 --> 01:22:42.708
He's up in the room.
You'll hear him soon enough.

01:22:46.958 --> 01:22:49.292
How is he sleeping?

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.083
He could crow at any hour.

01:22:52.833 --> 01:22:54.333
You never know.

01:23:00.583 --> 01:23:03.583
Speak of the angels
and you'll hear their wings.

01:23:31.292 --> 01:23:32.708
Hello, girls.

01:23:50.333 --> 01:23:52.833
He's sturdy, isn't he?

01:23:53.042 --> 01:23:54.667
He's a pet!

01:24:05.583 --> 01:24:07.042
No sign of himself?

01:24:08.708 --> 01:24:10.958
He went out earlier.

01:24:11.125 --> 01:24:12.792
Wherever he's gone.

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:24.875
Speak of the angels.

01:25:11.958 --> 01:25:13.958
Any news from home?

01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:16.917
Not much.

01:25:18.083 --> 01:25:20.250
All quiet really.

01:25:25.583 --> 01:25:29.042
- Have you caught a cold?
- No.

01:25:30.042 --> 01:25:31.750
You haven't?

01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:34.750
Nothing happened.

01:25:36.542 --> 01:25:38.417
What does that mean?

01:25:39.417 --> 01:25:40.958
I haven't caught a cold.

01:25:41.583 --> 01:25:43.958
The poor girl was in bed
for a few days.

01:26:03.875 --> 01:26:07.750
- What hurry is on you?
- No hurry, the usual.

01:26:07.958 --> 01:26:10.083
The cows don't give you any let up.

01:26:26.125 --> 01:26:27.958
Are you ready for home?

01:26:38.083 --> 01:26:40.708
Are you sure everything is ok?

01:26:40.917 --> 01:26:42.542
Yes.

01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:45.667
These are nice and floury.
They're queens.

01:26:46.958 --> 01:26:48.792
There was no need, Sean.

01:26:50.042 --> 01:26:52.792
It was a nice thing you did,
minding her.

01:26:54.167 --> 01:26:55.958
Thank you, both.

01:26:56.125 --> 01:27:01.542
She was welcome,
and is welcome again any time.

01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:03.667
She is a credit to you.

01:27:06.375 --> 01:27:08.125
Take care, my love.

01:27:20.833 --> 01:27:22.417
Goodbye, my love.

01:27:46.708 --> 01:27:48.500
What happened at all?

01:27:56.875 --> 01:27:58.292
Tell me.
