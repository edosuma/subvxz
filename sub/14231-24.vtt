11:00.702 --> 11:02.287
Nah, Petey,

11:02.370 --> 11:05.790
It's a little wormy. Uh-oh!

11:05.874 --> 11:08.335
I knew it. A big wormy, right?

11:08.418 --> 11:10.754
No! A dead end.

11:10.837 --> 11:11.880
Dead...

11:14.424 --> 11:16.092
What will we do now?

11:16.176 --> 11:18.678

11:25.810 --> 11:28.813
Oh, I was wondering when that lugnut

11:28.897 --> 11:30.440

11:30.523 --> 11:33.318
But I didn't know the meatloaf

12:11.856 --> 12:14.693
Playin'? You call this playin'?

12:14.776 --> 12:17.362
We were almost turned into pincushions.

12:17.445 --> 12:22.450
Ah, shucks, Petey,
what's a puncture or two between partners?

12:22.534 --> 12:24.577
So, how do we get outta here?

12:24.661 --> 12:26.788
Tell me that, partner.

12:26.871 --> 12:30.417

12:34.504 --> 12:36.089

12:36.172 --> 12:39.509
I brought some lunch, just in case.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.344

13:41.654 --> 13:43.865
We're close enough.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.367

13:45.450 --> 13:48.495
You better be right, or your name is mud.

14:50.765 --> 14:51.599
What?

14:51.683 --> 14:53.810
And there's a map
that'll take us right to it.

14:53.935 --> 14:56.104
Grab the map and meet me at the boat.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.030
Oops.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.826

Say it isn't so.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.153
Calm down, Petey.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.821
I memorialized the map.

15:46.905 --> 15:49.240
It's all right here in my head.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.701
Are you sure there's room enough in there?

15:51.785 --> 15:52.911
Trust me.

Well, OK.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.157
Are you sure you know what I'm doing?

16:31.282 --> 16:33.993
Sure. The map said to follow the river.

16:34.119 --> 16:37.414
Oh, yeah? Suppose the river's
going the wrong way?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.582
You ever thought about that, you squid?

16:41.376 --> 16:43.003
Oh, my gawrsh!

17:24.210 --> 17:26.504
This is only half yours, Petey.

17:26.629 --> 17:28.840
It's all mine, tinhorn.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.468
I stake my claim on it, see?

17:31.551 --> 17:34.095
Well, I stake my claim on it, too.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.097
-It's my claim.
-Our claim.

17:36.181 --> 17:37.432
-Mine.
-Ours.

17:37.515 --> 17:38.558
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

17:38.683 --> 17:41.811
We're not getting anywhere this way,
partner.

17:41.895 --> 17:44.439
Maybe if we get some shuteye,

17:44.522 --> 17:47.150
We can discuss it in the morning.

17:47.233 --> 17:50.528
Oh, okey-doke. I'll take the first watch.

17:50.612 --> 17:51.571
Why?

17:51.696 --> 17:53.448
No reason exactly.

17:53.531 --> 17:54.783
You want my gold.

17:54.866 --> 17:56.242
It's our gold!

17:56.326 --> 18:01.373
You're gonna wait 'til I'm asleep,
then steal my gold!

18:01.456 --> 18:03.750
Well, it's a little big
to fit in my pocket, Pete.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.043
Well, it won't work, see!

18:05.168 --> 18:07.671

18:51.923 --> 18:54.426
You heard me. When I nod my head, hit it!

18:54.551 --> 18:58.054
Gawrsh, Pete. That doesn't sound like
a good idea at all.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.973
Just do it!

19:00.849 --> 19:02.392

19:20.118 --> 19:21.661
