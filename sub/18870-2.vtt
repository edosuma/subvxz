WEBVTT

00:01.434 --> 00:02.836
<i>Previously on "Being Mary Jane"...</i>

00:02.902 --> 00:04.404
Garret wants to take you to lunch

00:04.471 --> 00:06.506
- to talk about your future on the show.
- Okay.

00:06.573 --> 00:09.909
If you play your cards right
you can be in the anchor chair by spring.

00:09.976 --> 00:15.115
I like you Mary Jane, I do.
That is why I'm gonna be frank.

00:15.181 --> 00:18.118
Garrett has no intention
of making you co-anchor.

00:18.184 --> 00:21.454
Why am I being led to believe
I have a future here?

00:21.521 --> 00:23.490
Garrett tries to pit us
against each other.

00:23.556 --> 00:27.327
Telegenic rivalry
between two black women?

00:27.394 --> 00:28.728
Try to sway things.

00:28.795 --> 00:31.731
<i>So, tonight's about getting your freak
out of your system?</i>

00:31.798 --> 00:34.334
<i>The last casual encounter
before my husband comes.</i>

00:34.401 --> 00:35.435
Tell me what you want.

00:35.502 --> 00:36.569
Tell me you love me.

00:50.450 --> 00:53.286
I got your text. Are you okay?

00:55.789 --> 00:58.525
Hey! Wait. What happened? Talk to me.

00:58.591 --> 01:01.227
I'm fine. I'm fine now.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.670
- Dante?
- Damn! My mom.

01:11.237 --> 01:13.039
Ma, get out.

01:20.613 --> 01:23.450
What do you think about us
getting our own place?

01:24.451 --> 01:28.121
How are we gonna pay for it?
You find a job and haven't told me?

01:28.188 --> 01:31.357
No. You got that settlement check coming.

01:31.424 --> 01:32.892
Settlement check?

01:34.027 --> 01:37.063
I told you I'd put that in a trust
for Treyvion

01:37.130 --> 01:38.932
and for your daughter Isabel.

01:39.699 --> 01:42.702
We could kick it at your place
if your family liked me.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.272
Why is it up to me
to put a roof over our heads?

01:46.339 --> 01:48.808
It's not. I'm gonna get a better job.

01:48.875 --> 01:51.678
How you gonna get to work?
You don't have a car.

01:51.744 --> 01:56.349
Maybe if you let me borrow your car
once in a while.

01:56.416 --> 01:58.017
No. I can see that now.

01:58.084 --> 02:02.622
Treyvion stranded at school,
while you out joy riding. Hell, no.

02:02.689 --> 02:05.024
Besides, I don't wanna lie
to my grandfather.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.327
Fine, then.

02:08.661 --> 02:12.298
I'll keep riding the bus 24-7
and never seeing my daughter.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.136
Hey!

02:17.770 --> 02:19.305
Wake up! What's wrong with you?

02:19.372 --> 02:20.540
I'm sorry.

02:21.508 --> 02:24.577
- Dear God. These mornings are killing me.
- Gosh!

02:24.644 --> 02:27.447
Means you're up by 3:00
and finished by 9:00.

02:27.514 --> 02:29.782
It's not even noon.
It feels like midnight.

02:29.849 --> 02:33.786
I'm sitting here trying to make you
the new face of "Great Day USA"

02:33.853 --> 02:35.989
and you are drooling on your Prada.

02:36.055 --> 02:37.690
I'm sorry. I'm listening. Yes.

02:37.757 --> 02:40.360
Let me guess. The comedian?

02:41.327 --> 02:44.831
That boy is no joke.
He kept me up all night.

02:45.932 --> 02:49.469
American Legacy Humanitarian Awards.
You two are covering it.

02:49.536 --> 02:51.204
Isn't that usually Ronda's thing?

02:51.271 --> 02:53.306
This year will be a little different.

02:53.373 --> 02:56.409
Ronda's the one getting the award.
For her charity work.

02:56.476 --> 03:00.613
They build all those schools in Kenya.
That's twice as big as Oprah's thing.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.449
Yeah,
the Ronda Sales New Hope Foundation?

03:03.516 --> 03:04.951
That's it, yeah.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.786
- Thank you so much, Garrett.
- Thanks.

03:07.787 --> 03:10.690
Having me cover Ronda's story. Really?

03:10.757 --> 03:14.327
Only two black women in the whole place
going for the same job.

03:14.394 --> 03:17.196
Ronda was right. They're trying
to pit us against each other.

03:17.263 --> 03:18.531
No surprises there.

03:18.598 --> 03:21.267
If they want a rivalry,
let's give 'em one.

03:21.334 --> 03:24.337
Are we gonna have
a bitch-slapping contest on live TV?

03:24.404 --> 03:26.906
If Garrett wants Mary Jane versus Ronda,

03:26.973 --> 03:29.976
we're gonna make you look
like the heroine and not the villain.

03:30.043 --> 03:33.413
- Okay, how?
- Get to know Ronda's world.

03:33.479 --> 03:35.448
Figure out what her weaknesses are.

03:36.683 --> 03:39.052
I've been looking up to that woman
since high school.

03:39.118 --> 03:41.621
You've got to look at this
as an insurance policy.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.456
I'm not a freakin' spy, Kara.

03:43.523 --> 03:47.827
Mary Jane, just follow my lead.
Trust me. If you don't win, I don't win.

03:49.662 --> 03:52.665
Mary Jane,
would you join me in my office?

03:52.732 --> 03:54.901
I specifically chose you for the story.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.136
I didn't realize that.

03:58.204 --> 03:59.272
Why?

03:59.339 --> 04:00.740
Every position I've held,

04:00.807 --> 04:03.943
I've always been the only
black woman in front of the camera.

04:04.010 --> 04:07.981
Not long ago, I was practically the only
black woman in this entire building.

04:08.047 --> 04:09.716
Not much has changed.

04:09.782 --> 04:12.485
They'll never said out loud.
But the assumption is

04:12.552 --> 04:15.588
there can only be one black woman
at the table.

04:15.655 --> 04:19.158
I think there's room for both of us.

04:19.225 --> 04:24.931
I say, why don't we work together
and get the network to see it too?

04:25.498 --> 04:27.967
What do you say? Are you with me?

04:29.135 --> 04:30.670
Yeah, I'm with you.

04:30.737 --> 04:31.771
- Yes.
- Yeah!

04:41.981 --> 04:44.984
So what inspired you
to start the New Hope Foundation?

04:45.051 --> 04:48.154
I'm just doing what any woman
in my position would do.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.823
I'm sure you have a cause
close to your heart.

04:50.890 --> 04:53.559
To be honest,
my whole family is a charity case.

04:53.626 --> 04:57.230
So, I've had my hands full with them
the past few years.

04:57.296 --> 05:01.167
If you're interested
in a really good charity,

05:01.868 --> 05:04.637
you need to find someone
with boots on the ground,

05:04.704 --> 05:07.173
someone you can really trust.

05:07.774 --> 05:12.512
I should put you in touch
with Corey Blanchard. Yes.

05:12.578 --> 05:16.249
He'll give you a feel for what it's like
to do the day-to-day operations.

05:16.315 --> 05:20.687
He's the president and CEO of my charity.

05:20.753 --> 05:26.359
He is loyal, he's a visionary,
he is whipsmart and trustworthy.

05:26.759 --> 05:30.430
Bring him in for an interview.
He looks great on a camera.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.599
- Is that so?
- Yes.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.769
- Thank you, Ronda.
- You're welcome, Mary Jane.

05:37.970 --> 05:41.040
I was burning my way
through Wharton Business School.

05:41.107 --> 05:43.643
Ronda was a rising star at ABC,

05:44.510 --> 05:46.646
and I had a bit of fan-boy moment.

05:46.713 --> 05:50.550
I wrote her a letter. A few days later,
she responded to me personally

05:50.616 --> 05:53.553
and offered me an internship
at her newly founded charity.

05:53.619 --> 05:56.489
And 77 million dollars
in charitable donations later,

05:56.556 --> 05:59.258
you went from intern to CEO.

05:59.325 --> 06:01.494
I've got to ask, why so much money?

06:01.561 --> 06:04.363
Each school in Kenya comes
with a 10 million dollars price tag.

06:04.430 --> 06:07.667
- What do you get for that amount?
- I'll send over the renderings.

06:07.734 --> 06:11.471
It was really great meeting you.
I appreciate you coming on the show.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.607
The pleasure was all mine.
If you have any additional questions...

06:14.674 --> 06:16.008
I've got one, actually.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.879
What made Ronda decide on Kenya?

06:19.946 --> 06:22.048
I've spoken to a lot of people
that work there

06:22.115 --> 06:24.383
and they said it's very difficult
to do good work

06:24.450 --> 06:26.085
because of the political corruption.

06:26.819 --> 06:30.123
Integrity.
It's the cornerstone of our business.

06:30.189 --> 06:33.392
I assure you we only work
with honest people.

06:33.459 --> 06:34.861
Certainly.

06:34.927 --> 06:37.196
Again, we appreciate your time.

06:37.263 --> 06:39.098
You put him on the defensive.

06:39.165 --> 06:40.867
I'm just trying to help.

06:40.933 --> 06:42.502
Those eyes of his

06:42.568 --> 06:46.205
have probably kept him from answering
tough questions his entire life.

06:46.272 --> 06:48.608
Damn. Jilted lover?

06:48.674 --> 06:50.309
More like jilted kid.

06:50.376 --> 06:53.012
Haven't had time to help Max
with his history project.

06:53.079 --> 06:57.083
Listen, maybe if we get done
with the gala early enough, we could...

06:57.150 --> 07:00.486
- I'd have time to call him, okay?
- Yeah, sure.

07:01.888 --> 07:06.459
I know. My stylist went a bit overboard.
She loves dressing me for awards dinners.

07:06.526 --> 07:10.062
Overboard is an understatement.
How do you even choose?

07:10.129 --> 07:12.899
- Well, honey, you're gonna have to.
- But...

07:14.367 --> 07:15.568
All your size.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.070
Ronda...

07:26.078 --> 07:29.649
No sequins. That shiny equals showy.

07:29.715 --> 07:32.852
Why don't you get a little matte fabric?
More relaxed and congenial.

07:32.919 --> 07:34.120
Okay.

07:36.088 --> 07:37.356
Green.

07:38.291 --> 07:42.895
That screams healthy, youthful,
but inexperienced. No, no.

07:43.529 --> 07:47.700
But it also is the color of money.
And in a room full of millionaires,

07:47.767 --> 07:50.303
I'd hate for them to think of me
as their property.

07:50.369 --> 07:53.005
You understand there's
more to preparing for an interview

07:53.072 --> 07:55.608
than jotting down a questions.
Good girl.

07:55.675 --> 07:57.310
Let me see.

08:00.012 --> 08:03.850
Elegant, eye-capturing. That's a winner.

08:03.916 --> 08:08.120
Make sure your date wears a black tie.
It's so much easier for men.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.860
12 dollar crisps?

08:15.261 --> 08:17.063
These better be gold-plated.

08:17.930 --> 08:21.267
You know what I could go for right now?
Popcorn.

08:22.301 --> 08:23.803
Here.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.839
Your firstborn, please

08:26.906 --> 08:30.610
Hell no. Movie theater popcorn,
with a bunch of butter.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.913
- What's the difference?
- It...

08:33.980 --> 08:37.216
If you don't know the difference,
it's not even worth explaining.

08:40.853 --> 08:43.222
Are you writing a joke about me?

08:43.289 --> 08:45.391
- Let me see it.
- No.

08:47.526 --> 08:50.663
- Look at your cute little "nekkid" ass.
-"Neck-id? "?

08:50.730 --> 08:52.565
Don't you mean naked?

08:52.632 --> 08:56.402
No. Naked is when you don't have
any clothes on.

08:56.469 --> 09:00.539
Nekkid is when you don't have
any clothes on and you're up to no good.

09:00.606 --> 09:05.111
So naked means exposed,
bearing your soul for all to see.

09:05.177 --> 09:07.146
You should to be funny,
not philosophical.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.949
- Have you not seen Louie C. K.?
- Jesus.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.250
Put your clothes on.

09:11.317 --> 09:13.853
What? Why? Where are we going?

09:13.920 --> 09:17.590
We are gonna get you naked.

09:22.962 --> 09:26.766
Are we early
or does this movie just suck?

09:27.566 --> 09:29.635
It starts in an hour.

09:31.537 --> 09:33.205
Okay.

09:33.272 --> 09:36.409
I figured we could spend
some actual time together,

09:36.475 --> 09:38.945
you know, talking.

09:39.011 --> 09:40.379
Right.

09:42.214 --> 09:43.883
So what's the movie about?

09:44.617 --> 09:46.485
It's...

09:46.552 --> 09:49.722
It's about this girl.
She meets an anonymous guy,

09:49.789 --> 09:53.225
takes him home one night
for a sex fantasy.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.862
It turns out she wanted him to say
"I love you."

09:56.929 --> 10:01.334
Yeah, I think I saw the trailer.
It was called "A drunken mess."

10:01.400 --> 10:03.169
Well, it had some redeeming qualities.

10:03.836 --> 10:07.273
An epic romance with a dashing British,
Nigerian lead.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.241
Tell me more about him.

10:09.308 --> 10:11.177
He's a real Idris Elba type.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.612
- Really? Okay.
- Yes, really.

10:13.679 --> 10:15.614
He's charming. He's funny.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.018
A good father to a boy and a girl,

10:22.355 --> 10:23.622
Aidan and Katherine.

10:24.156 --> 10:27.893
They're 12 and 14.
They live with their mom in London.

10:30.429 --> 10:32.031
Why didn't you tell me about them?

10:32.098 --> 10:34.200
It's been pretty hard to get
a word in edgewise.

10:34.266 --> 10:36.335
These last days
I had my head between your legs.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.838
- Right. There was that.
- Yeah.

10:38.904 --> 10:40.339
Okay.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.809
So what's up with you and their mom?

10:43.876 --> 10:46.912
We never married. Co-parenting, you know?

10:46.979 --> 10:48.848
Still friends.

10:48.914 --> 10:52.184
Why would you move across the pond
if your family's back there?

10:53.552 --> 10:57.523
Good question. I turned it down
the first three times my agent asked me.

10:57.590 --> 10:58.858
Because of your kids?

11:00.026 --> 11:03.562
I got a bit of success in England,
which I'm grateful for.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.866
But I wanted new mountains to climb.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.869
Yeah, New York is certainly that.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.871
It felt like the right to revisit it.

11:11.937 --> 11:16.008
The kids are at boarding school
and don't find me a bit funny anymore.

11:16.642 --> 11:20.513
Plus, I've always wanted to sample
real American life.

11:20.579 --> 11:22.081
American food,

11:22.148 --> 11:23.916
American women.

11:25.651 --> 11:28.254
What about you?
Why did you move to New York?

11:28.320 --> 11:29.789
You know, same.

11:31.257 --> 11:35.294
Right, not enough American women
for you in Atlanta.

11:38.130 --> 11:41.634
- You okay with me having kids?
- No, I love kids.

11:42.802 --> 11:44.603
So...

11:44.670 --> 11:48.707
I have this fancy awards dinner for work.

11:48.774 --> 11:52.244
Gonna be a bunch of old,
rich, white, stuffy people.

11:52.311 --> 11:54.580
An absolute snooze fest.

11:55.781 --> 11:56.916
Would you like to come?

11:57.783 --> 11:58.784
Absolutely.

11:59.351 --> 12:03.255
Old, rich, white people, they love me.
It's the accent.

12:03.322 --> 12:07.159
I put on the black tie, I remind them
of the butler they always wanted.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.831
Where's the rest of it?

12:11.897 --> 12:14.433
That's the full amount minus legal fees.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.369
A detailed accounting is available here.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.740
Your family had indicated
you wanted to set up a trust.

12:21.807 --> 12:23.209
Yeah, I'm gonna do that.

12:23.275 --> 12:24.343
Niecy.

12:25.177 --> 12:27.213
Is there a problem?

12:28.180 --> 12:31.550
Just curious.
How much could I get in cash today?

12:32.785 --> 12:36.755
So the segment will be divided
into three different parts.

12:36.822 --> 12:38.824
The red carpet, the nominees...

12:38.891 --> 12:42.094
I got you and date moved to my table.

12:42.161 --> 12:47.032
You'll be sitting next to Corey.
Your boyfriend will be okay with that?

12:47.099 --> 12:48.634
He'll be fine.

12:48.701 --> 12:51.070
Corey gets along with
everyone, except for agents.

12:51.137 --> 12:53.572
God, your date's not an agent, is he?

12:53.639 --> 12:56.208
No. He's a comedian, actually.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.978
Fun. He makes a living doing that?

12:59.044 --> 13:02.314
Enough to support a family in the UK
and a place here.

13:02.915 --> 13:04.950
- Children?
- Two.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.720
By the same woman.

13:08.721 --> 13:12.324
- They were never married.
- I'm sure he'll have everyone laughing.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.002
Idris, here.

13:23.068 --> 13:25.871
<i>Hey. So, you know...</i>

13:25.938 --> 13:30.276
I'm realizing this charity event
is probably gonna be so boring for you.

13:30.342 --> 13:32.077
Are you sure you'd want to come?

13:32.144 --> 13:34.113
I grew up in the Church of England.

13:34.180 --> 13:37.416
I'm a seasoned pro at boring,
stuffy environments.

13:37.483 --> 13:41.320
Well, I'm gonna be working a lot more
than I thought, so...

13:41.387 --> 13:43.822
Mary Jane, what's up?

13:44.723 --> 13:47.226
If you don't want me to come,
just say so.

13:47.293 --> 13:52.464
It's a really big event for me,
and I can't have any distractions.

13:52.531 --> 13:55.734
Okay. I was looking forward
to seeing you in more

13:55.801 --> 13:57.870
than your underwear
for a second time, but...

13:59.071 --> 14:01.740
<i>- as long as you're being real with me.
- No, I'm being real.</i>

14:01.807 --> 14:02.841
<i>Great.</i>

14:02.908 --> 14:05.311
Well, you can make it up to me
another time.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.480
- Talk later.
- All right.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.654
Take a look at this one over here.
It's really cool.

14:15.721 --> 14:17.056
How many airbags doe sit have?

14:17.122 --> 14:19.925
Ten airbags, dual, front,
and side impact

14:19.992 --> 14:23.028
with overhead and knee,
as well as rear-side impact.

14:23.095 --> 14:25.931
- That's not bad for 13,000.
- Not bad at all.

14:25.998 --> 14:27.733
What you think, Dante?

14:27.800 --> 14:29.668
This is what I'm talking about.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.976
See, Treyvion, isn't this cool?

14:37.042 --> 14:39.311
Can a car seat even fit back there?

14:40.579 --> 14:43.148
Never been asked that before,
but I'll check.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.050
- You like this car, little man?
- Yes.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.455
How much is this one?

14:49.521 --> 14:52.658
After taxes, fully loaded, 45,000.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.928
But I could find something else
more in your price range.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.967
- I'll take it.
- Yeah!

15:03.135 --> 15:04.403
Are you excited?

15:05.004 --> 15:06.171
Yeah.

15:09.508 --> 15:10.609
Look at this.

15:10.676 --> 15:14.079
Ronda's schools are in the middle
of warlord territory.

15:14.146 --> 15:17.316
There's no way she's not paying someone
off to operate.

15:17.383 --> 15:20.252
That can be the cost
of doing business in Africa, right?

15:20.986 --> 15:22.855
You think Ronda knows about it?

15:22.921 --> 15:24.323
Why? What are you thinking?

15:24.390 --> 15:27.326
Maybe you can do some digging around
at the awards ceremony.

15:27.393 --> 15:30.829
They're not going to thank the warlord
during their acceptance speech.

15:30.896 --> 15:34.600
I'm serious. Get Lee to help you.
Use his comedic charm or something.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.068
Lee's not gonna be going.

15:36.135 --> 15:37.469
What? Why?

15:38.604 --> 15:41.273
Is that your suggestion or his?

15:43.942 --> 15:47.680
Meet Lee's baby mama, Zoe Sky.

15:49.748 --> 15:53.719
She's got her own moccasin line?
Look at these. They're so cute.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.290
So it was your choice.

15:58.357 --> 16:00.159
He's got two kids already anyway.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.063
- Sorry.
- Yeah. He's a 40-year old man.

16:04.129 --> 16:07.232
If he ain't got some kids and hot exes,
we'd be worried.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.736
Guess I was just hoping
he'd be my black unicorn.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.571
God, please.

16:12.638 --> 16:16.141
Besides, what would we tell our kids
about how we met?

16:16.208 --> 16:19.578
"Babies, Daddy was horny
and Mama was a freak.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.713
Eat your peas."

16:20.779 --> 16:23.515
First of all, every story
starts out that way.

16:23.582 --> 16:25.784
Secondly, every parent knows
you lie to your kids

16:25.851 --> 16:28.654
about two things: sex and Santa Claus.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.690
See, Lee would tell them.
That's another problem.

16:31.757 --> 16:33.692
He's open and honest.

16:33.759 --> 16:37.930
So he's real, emotionally available,

16:37.996 --> 16:40.966
good in bed, and a proven father figure?

16:41.033 --> 16:43.435
Girl, you need to stay far away
from that one.

16:43.502 --> 16:46.338
Hell, yes. Right? Don't you think so?

16:49.274 --> 16:53.145
And "Great Day USA" is excited
to be a part of this inspiring event.

16:53.212 --> 16:54.747
I'm Mary Jane Paul.

16:56.882 --> 17:01.019
I bet there's three quarters of
New York's wealth in this room right now.

17:01.086 --> 17:03.822
If a bomb dropped,
it would tank the economy.

17:03.889 --> 17:06.725
Bunch of rich-ass folks
patting each other on the back.

17:06.792 --> 17:09.228
Okay, grumpy. Let's go.
We've got work to do.

17:09.294 --> 17:11.397
I'd like you to meet
my incredible family.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.298
- My husband Ellison.
- Hi.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.666
Pleased to meet you.

17:14.733 --> 17:19.071
Daughters Dawn and Camille.
Camille will be attending Yale this fall.

17:20.105 --> 17:23.876
- It's great to meet you. I'm...
- Mary Jane Paul. We know who you are.

17:23.942 --> 17:26.712
With all of Ronda's bragging,
I feel I know you already.

17:27.246 --> 17:30.616
- I don't know what to say.
- Say you're liking your new job.

17:30.682 --> 17:34.586
Ronda's delighted to have
another woman like you on the show.

17:34.653 --> 17:36.789
And we're gonna grab a drink.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.024
Come, darling.

17:39.091 --> 17:42.428
- Nice to meet you.
- Bye, sweetie.

17:42.494 --> 17:44.163
Ellison seems nice.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.565
He knows talent when he sees it.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.302
You thinking what I'm thinking?

17:50.369 --> 17:51.403
What?

17:52.204 --> 17:56.942
Darling, there are billions of dollars
in this room.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.011
And they all ain't married.

17:59.077 --> 18:02.414
Can't say the thought
has not crossed my mind.

18:04.116 --> 18:07.052
Probably a good thing
the comedian couldn't come.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.856
- Tequila, please.
- Two.

18:53.398 --> 18:57.236
Okay, seriously though.
There's no cameras around.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.137
It's too good to be true.

18:59.204 --> 19:01.673
You're secretly a Kenyan Warlord, right?

19:01.740 --> 19:05.344
You know, not everything in Africa
is run by warlords.

19:05.410 --> 19:07.079
Come on, you can tell me.

19:07.579 --> 19:10.883
You've been asking me questions
all night. When is it my turn?

19:10.949 --> 19:12.484
Well, I'm a journalist.

19:13.352 --> 19:14.586
What do you want to know?

19:15.754 --> 19:17.356
- You just moved here, right?
- Yes.

19:17.422 --> 19:19.391
- Where are you living?
- Hotel Verdi.

19:19.458 --> 19:21.727
Until I find something more permanent.

19:21.793 --> 19:23.729
- You should check out Ditmas Park.
- Yeah?

19:23.795 --> 19:28.166
In Brooklyn, yeah. I love it there.
Great place to raise a family.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.470
- You have a family?
- No, not yet.

19:31.537 --> 19:35.307
But when I do settle down, I am not
gonna raise my family in Manhattan.

19:35.374 --> 19:36.508
Really?

19:36.575 --> 19:41.046
I've fallen in love with the city.
The lights, the action, the hustle.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.782
Which is what everyone
who just moved here says.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.717
Okay. I'll check out Brooklyn.

19:45.784 --> 19:49.154
But I'm not in a rush
to lose my turndown service.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.123
I do a mean turndown service myself.

19:51.189 --> 19:53.425
A little chocolate on the pillow
and everything.

19:53.492 --> 19:54.760
Really?

19:58.497 --> 20:00.699
Can you excuse me for just one second?

20:03.502 --> 20:04.603
Where are you going?

20:04.670 --> 20:07.973
I told you. Got to go home
and help Max with his report.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.910
Too bad you wasted so much time
playing Cinderella with that Andre 2.0.

20:11.977 --> 20:13.979
- I'm getting good intel.
- Right.

20:14.046 --> 20:17.082
Don't forget. He runs Ronda's charity.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.184
He's an enemy, Mary Jane.

20:19.251 --> 20:21.920
You don't think you're taking this
a little too personally?

20:21.987 --> 20:24.022
You're the one getting all personal
with her.

20:24.089 --> 20:27.125
'Cause you told me to get personal
to learn to her weaknesses.

20:27.192 --> 20:31.296
Not like that. Ronda is a roadblock.
She is not an ally. Come on.

20:31.363 --> 20:34.132
- She's Ronda effin' Sales, Kara.
- So what?

20:34.199 --> 20:38.837
She's been fighting off bitches like us
longer than anyone in this business.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.139
- We could learn a lot from her.
- Yeah.

20:41.206 --> 20:44.676
You know what?
I totally get your fascination with her.

20:44.743 --> 20:48.213
Whenever she talks, all I hear
are your cliched little post-it notes.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.816
- You just don't get it.
-'Cause I'm not a black woman?

20:55.887 --> 20:59.691
<i>¿Sabes qué?
Tú hablas mucha mierda, ¿okay?</i>

20:59.758 --> 21:01.793
<i>I'm leaving. Yo me voy.</i>

21:01.860 --> 21:04.596
<i>Adiós, p... Adiós.</i>

21:11.470 --> 21:12.571
Hey!

21:14.039 --> 21:16.241
You're supposed
to be getting ready for bed.

21:17.476 --> 21:21.079
What's this? I haven't seen this before.
Is it new?

21:21.146 --> 21:22.280
Yeah.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.449
- Where did you get it from?
- Dante.

21:25.984 --> 21:27.185
Dante?

21:29.054 --> 21:30.389
When did you see Dante?

21:30.455 --> 21:33.425
When we were sitting in the red car.
We drove it.

21:36.762 --> 21:37.896
Okay.

21:38.997 --> 21:40.499
Let me get you ready for bed.

21:40.565 --> 21:42.801
Let's go. Come on up.

21:44.269 --> 21:45.370
You're getting heavy.

21:48.206 --> 21:51.143
When were you going to tell me
you were seeing Dante?

21:58.984 --> 22:02.421
Look, Dante's been really steppin' it up
these past few weeks.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.223
His timing is questionable.
You're getting that settlement.

22:05.290 --> 22:08.360
You know how hard it is.
Two kids, two different fathers.

22:08.427 --> 22:12.531
Dante doesn't care. He's just as cool
with Treyvion as he is with Isabel.

22:12.597 --> 22:14.599
They don't need Dante. They have us.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.401
And what if that's not enough?

22:17.069 --> 22:21.406
He ain't perfect,
but Dante is good with those kids.

22:23.809 --> 22:26.678
Please,
don't tell granddaddy and grandma.

22:27.612 --> 22:29.514
You know, if they find out...

22:29.581 --> 22:31.683
Just promise me
you won't give him any money.

22:32.484 --> 22:33.885
I promise.

22:34.419 --> 22:38.356
"To the girls of Kenya,
may you continue be bastions of hope..."

22:38.423 --> 22:39.991
What did you say?

22:40.692 --> 22:44.463
"Bastions of hope
in the tempest of fear".

22:44.529 --> 22:46.465
- That was so good
- Thank you.

22:46.531 --> 22:47.966
You wrote that yourself?

22:48.033 --> 22:51.303
Darling! I've been writing and editing
my own copy

22:51.369 --> 22:55.674
ever since my nomination
as Davis Elementary Hall Monitor.

22:57.375 --> 23:01.580
Although, I just realized
I missed something very important.

23:03.482 --> 23:07.085
"And finally,
I'd like to dedicate this award

23:07.152 --> 23:10.822
to a very special man
by the name of Steve Pardini.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.458
Steve, if you're out there listening,

23:13.525 --> 23:15.560
despite your best efforts,

23:17.162 --> 23:18.630
I win.

23:18.697 --> 23:23.969
And you can kiss my voluptuous,
multimillion dollar ass".

23:26.505 --> 23:28.673
Who is Steve Pardini?

23:29.775 --> 23:34.045
A producer during my early days
at Channel 5.

23:34.112 --> 23:36.748
Young white boy
who didn't know his ass from his ankle.

23:36.815 --> 23:39.785
But he was a whiz
at putting the blame on me.

23:41.153 --> 23:45.457
That was my first and last time
ever getting fired from a job.

23:45.524 --> 23:47.359
I know that story all too well.

23:47.425 --> 23:51.429
- You have a Steve Pardini?
- And he is not worth the story.

23:52.464 --> 23:56.001
Now come out with it. Come on.

23:56.067 --> 23:57.569
Justin Talbot.

23:57.636 --> 23:59.704
CNN, black man.

24:00.405 --> 24:03.041
And this brother told me he had my back.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.444
I didn't realize that meant stabbing me

24:06.511 --> 24:09.114
in the back and then walking
over my dead body.

24:10.715 --> 24:14.319
And now you're a correspondent

24:14.386 --> 24:17.189
on America's top-rated morning show.

24:18.156 --> 24:21.560
I say Justin Talbot did you a favor.

24:21.626 --> 24:25.363
Here's to Steve and Justin!

24:27.799 --> 24:29.201
Babe.

24:29.835 --> 24:33.638
- They kicking us out.
- Yes, darling. Be right there.

24:33.705 --> 24:35.440
- I have to know.
- What?

24:35.507 --> 24:37.809
Whatever became of Steve Pardini?

24:37.876 --> 24:40.879
Selling lawn furniture
off the Garden State Parkway.

24:41.746 --> 24:42.981
Yes!

24:43.048 --> 24:46.318
- You ladies still here?
- I'm waiting for my Uber.

24:46.384 --> 24:50.288
Maybe Corey can do something to fix that.

24:50.355 --> 24:51.923
Goodnight, you two!

24:56.962 --> 25:00.665
Well, I'm not one to disobey my boss.

25:01.499 --> 25:03.034
We couldn't have that.

25:09.174 --> 25:12.010
The hotel with the infamous
turndown service.

25:12.077 --> 25:15.046
- Yes, home, sweet home. Do you like it?
- I love it.

25:19.517 --> 25:20.518
Yes!

25:22.020 --> 25:24.089
Can you excuse me for just one second?

25:24.155 --> 25:25.423
Yeah, of course.

25:29.094 --> 25:31.763
- What are you doing here?
- I left my notepad in your room.

25:31.830 --> 25:33.265
Since you weren't responding,

25:33.331 --> 25:35.634
I thought I'd check if the concierge
would let me in.

25:35.700 --> 25:40.138
Problem is, I totally forgot
my token white friend at home so no good.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.007
I'm sorry. I was working.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.778
Yeah, I can see that.

25:47.746 --> 25:49.080
Is that your driver?

25:49.147 --> 25:51.783
Did you tip him?
Looks like he's waiting for something.

25:51.850 --> 25:54.219
I should've known
Old Spice Man was your type.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.955
First of all,
you wouldn't know what my type is.

25:57.022 --> 25:59.958
And second of all,
we never said we were exclusive.

26:00.025 --> 26:01.459
Fair enough.

26:01.526 --> 26:05.530
But the girl I met in the comedy club
seemed like she wanted more.

26:06.131 --> 26:07.966
Maybe you didn't know
that girl that well.

26:09.434 --> 26:10.969
Can't argue with you there.

26:12.537 --> 26:15.607
You certainly are a riddle, Mary Jane.

26:15.674 --> 26:17.676
Maybe that's what makes it
so intoxicating.

26:17.742 --> 26:18.944
I'm a riddle?

26:19.010 --> 26:22.580
Yes. A woman so magnetic
millions of people watch her on TV.

26:22.647 --> 26:26.785
And so broken
she pleads for love from a stranger.

26:28.753 --> 26:32.324
From where I'm standing,
her life looks pretty damn good to me.

26:33.091 --> 26:35.226
Yet, she's running
from the thing she wants most.

26:36.461 --> 26:37.996
Question is, why?

26:41.266 --> 26:42.634
You know what?

26:43.201 --> 26:45.270
I'm done trying to figure you out.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.913
- You all right?
- Yeah, fine. Yeah.

26:54.980 --> 26:56.548
- Sure?
- I'm sorry about that.

26:56.614 --> 27:00.352
No problem. Don't worry about it.
So how 'bout we go have that drink?

27:00.418 --> 27:03.755
How 'bout we save that drink
for another time?

27:04.356 --> 27:06.725
I had a lovely evening. Thank you.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.193
My pleasure.

27:10.996 --> 27:12.597
Good night.

27:37.188 --> 27:39.991
Just 'cause we're splitting the cab
doesn't mean we have to talk.

27:48.266 --> 27:49.334
Hey.

27:50.468 --> 27:52.070
Look, I'm still in this.

27:53.905 --> 27:55.407
Come on.

27:56.274 --> 27:58.610
This is what's known as an olive branch.

28:03.681 --> 28:06.317
- Did you sleep with Corey?
- No!

28:06.384 --> 28:08.253
- Really?
- I didn't.

28:09.487 --> 28:10.989
But I can't ignore Corey might be

28:11.056 --> 28:13.525
my black unicorn
just because he's connected to Ronda.

28:13.591 --> 28:16.061
There's no such thing as black unicorns.

28:16.127 --> 28:20.465
He makes good money, has a steady job,
and his own place in Ditmas Park.

28:20.532 --> 28:24.669
The brother's got a little cash.
Did you say... Ditmas Park?

28:24.736 --> 28:28.273
- Hello. And he has a backyard. Wanna see?
- What? Yes.

28:28.973 --> 28:30.575
You pulled it up already.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.577
- Gosh!
- Yeah.

28:32.644 --> 28:33.812
Hold on.

28:34.279 --> 28:37.715
There's two listings here. Does he have
another place on the Upper East Side?

28:37.782 --> 28:41.019
No. That has to be a mistake.
He said he hated Manhattan.

28:41.086 --> 28:44.189
There's a Claire Davenport
listed on the Manhattan property.

28:44.255 --> 28:46.124
Maybe an ex-wife?

28:46.191 --> 28:47.559
He's never been married.

28:48.793 --> 28:51.029
- Oh boy.
- I don't like where this is going.

28:51.796 --> 28:53.364
You don't want to see this?

28:57.068 --> 28:58.470
He lied, right?

28:59.704 --> 29:03.341
- This crap is deeper than I thought.
- What's going on?

29:03.408 --> 29:05.143
It all makes sense now.

29:05.210 --> 29:11.182
This brownstone sold
for 5,374,920 dollars.

29:11.249 --> 29:16.154
Look how much this Sawyer
Holdings LLC, whatever that is,

29:16.221 --> 29:19.757
charged for building
one of the unfinished schools.

29:19.824 --> 29:22.260
The same exact amount.

29:22.327 --> 29:25.130
- Okay, so that's not a coincidence.
- No.

29:25.196 --> 29:27.365
How did you figure this out so fast?

29:27.432 --> 29:30.768
When you're going through a divorce
you know where to look for this stuff.

29:30.835 --> 29:34.339
So if they spent this money
on the property,

29:34.405 --> 29:38.743
couldn't it just be, like,
the local office for the charity?

29:38.810 --> 29:41.045
So how come
it's not showing up in the financials?

29:41.112 --> 29:44.182
And why have we never heard
of Claire Davenport?

29:47.352 --> 29:50.622
Please, Lord, be a wrinkly old grandma.

29:54.592 --> 29:57.495
Yeah. That's definitely not
a wrinkly old grandma.

29:58.596 --> 30:03.468
So Corey's been stealing money
from African orphans

30:03.535 --> 30:05.870
to pay for Becky with the brownstone.

30:07.639 --> 30:10.074
He said he was single.
He's supposed to be single.

30:11.242 --> 30:14.612
Don't even do it.
Don't say "I told you so".

30:14.679 --> 30:16.548
I'm not saying a word.

30:19.184 --> 30:21.152
You know there's only one way
to know for sure.

30:22.220 --> 30:24.822
No. I know that look.
Don't you get crazy, Mary Jane.

30:24.889 --> 30:27.192
Listen to me.
There's a smarter way to handle this.

30:27.258 --> 30:30.461
MJ, listen to me. Wait, stop it!
Hold on one second!

30:30.528 --> 30:31.896
MJ, wait a minute!

30:33.064 --> 30:37.936
- I've done this before.
- Yeah, my point exactly. It's crazy.

30:40.305 --> 30:41.406
Wait a minute!

30:46.277 --> 30:48.213
My God.

30:48.279 --> 30:50.381
No. Damn it.

30:50.448 --> 30:54.619
Corey isn't stealing from a charity
for his model girlfriend. Ellison is.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.755
You know what, I bet you he's using Corey
to help him do it.

30:57.822 --> 30:59.824
- No. We don't know that.
- It doesn't matter.

30:59.891 --> 31:02.927
We gotta blow this wide open
and let the pieces fall where they may.

31:02.994 --> 31:06.598
- No, if Ronda finds out...
- If Ronda finds out? No. Listen to me.

31:06.664 --> 31:08.499
We are calling Garrett, like now.

31:08.566 --> 31:12.136
Wait. Let's make sure
our information is airtight.

31:12.203 --> 31:15.573
Then go to Garrett first thing
in the morning before the piece airs.

31:16.307 --> 31:19.644
We're trying to get a little dirt
on Ronda, not trying to ruin her life.

31:19.711 --> 31:20.712
Okay?

31:22.947 --> 31:24.282
All right, fine.

31:24.849 --> 31:28.119
But we go to Garrett.
First thing. Telling you right now.

31:29.821 --> 31:31.589
You think he's gonna shoot the messenger?

31:32.156 --> 31:35.960
Are you kidding me? He's lucky it was us
and not "60 Minutes."

31:36.027 --> 31:38.896
At least this way,
Garrett can control the story.

31:38.963 --> 31:40.665
What you think he's gonna do?

31:40.732 --> 31:45.003
I don't know, but there'll be
an investigation. And you know what?

31:46.004 --> 31:51.042
Ronda can't sit in that anchor chair
if she's at the center of a controversy.

32:05.823 --> 32:08.059
Good morning. Come on in, girl.

32:08.826 --> 32:11.929
I wanted to tell you that you did
a marvelous job on the segment.

32:12.864 --> 32:13.898
Thank you.

32:13.965 --> 32:16.634
We make a good team, you and I.
And I was thinking

32:16.701 --> 32:20.938
I have some story ideas
you would be great for.

32:21.005 --> 32:22.640
I'm gonna call Garrett today.

32:22.707 --> 32:24.676
There's something I have to tell you.

32:41.459 --> 32:42.860
31 years.

32:45.263 --> 32:48.733
For the past 31 years

32:50.802 --> 32:53.604
we promised each other
we'd share everything.

32:55.173 --> 32:57.408
I suspected there was another woman,

33:00.812 --> 33:02.647
but never this.

33:03.748 --> 33:05.216
I'm so sorry.

33:10.922 --> 33:14.125
I built that charity from nothing.

33:15.326 --> 33:17.195
It was my brand.

33:21.999 --> 33:23.701
Now it's poisoned.

33:28.439 --> 33:31.943
I understand that you
have to tell Garrett.

33:32.877 --> 33:34.145
The segment can't air.

33:36.214 --> 33:38.416
This is not how I wanted it to happen.

33:41.052 --> 33:42.220
I'm sorry.

33:45.923 --> 33:48.493
Do what you have to do, Mary Jane.

33:58.803 --> 33:59.837
Ready?

33:59.904 --> 34:01.506
<i>We're celebrating in New York...</i>

34:01.572 --> 34:04.242
Garrett, we have to cut
the Dawkins Awards segment.

34:04.308 --> 34:06.377
- Why? It's great.
- Because we discovered...

34:06.444 --> 34:07.578
<i>Ronda's going off script.</i>

34:07.645 --> 34:10.214
<i>Before moving to the next segment,
I need to say something.</i>

34:10.281 --> 34:16.187
To the network, my business associates,
my family, and my trusted friends.

34:16.254 --> 34:18.356
This morning, I learned that an associate

34:18.423 --> 34:21.626
that I trusted with running my charity
has been embezzling money.

34:21.692 --> 34:22.994
She put this on Corey?

34:23.060 --> 34:24.629
You gotta be kidding me.

34:24.695 --> 34:28.599
I am incredibly sorry for this oversight,
and I take full responsibility.

34:28.666 --> 34:30.301
She got ahead of it.

34:30.368 --> 34:31.402
Unbelievable.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.237
Did you have something to do with this?

34:33.304 --> 34:36.474
Effective immediately, I'll step down
from the charity board

34:36.541 --> 34:39.977
and a third party will be put in charge
of all future operations.

34:40.044 --> 34:43.347
I urge the public
to please not lose faith

34:43.414 --> 34:46.250
in an organization
that has done so much good

34:46.918 --> 34:48.886
for the young girls in Kenya.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.957
And not to let the actions of one man
sully the invaluable work

34:53.024 --> 34:54.826
we intended to do in the future.

34:54.892 --> 34:56.494
<i>Thank you so much for your time.</i>

34:56.561 --> 34:59.730
<i>And now, Natalie will fill us in
on the rest of the details.</i>

35:03.701 --> 35:06.237
So when did you tell her? This morning?

35:06.304 --> 35:10.274
Kara, she mentored me, okay?
She let me into her world.

35:10.341 --> 35:13.778
I wasn't gonna let her whole world
blow up without telling her first.

35:13.845 --> 35:18.316
I brought you into my world, Mary Jane.
Me. I got you this damn job.

35:18.382 --> 35:21.352
It's out there. The whole world knows.
She's ruined.

35:21.986 --> 35:23.454
That's what you wanted, right?

35:24.422 --> 35:25.690
You know what?

35:25.756 --> 35:28.726
Next time you decide
to make a decision on my behalf,

35:28.793 --> 35:31.062
have the decency to loop me in, okay?

35:32.330 --> 35:33.464
Kara...

35:48.546 --> 35:50.081
Corey!

35:50.147 --> 35:54.085
Corey, I am so sorry.
I had no idea Ronda would...

35:54.151 --> 35:55.953
Throw me under the bus?

35:56.621 --> 35:58.256
It's cool. Don't worry about it.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.458
- You're gonna face charges.
- Yeah.

36:00.525 --> 36:04.629
I'll take the plea.
Minimal probation time. No jail time.

36:04.695 --> 36:06.097
Then I'll go overseas

36:06.163 --> 36:08.599
and manage Ronda and Ellison's estate
in St. Croix.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.636
Ronda cut you a deal.

36:13.471 --> 36:16.307
You agreed to take the fall
for her and her husband.

36:18.376 --> 36:21.746
When Ronda offers you a deal,
you take it.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.749
She's not somebody you want to mess with.

37:10.428 --> 37:11.662
Hey.

37:12.530 --> 37:15.399
The emcee from the comedy club
told me I might find you here.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.336
And I wanted to return this to you.

37:20.972 --> 37:24.075
I bought a new one. You can keep it.

37:29.914 --> 37:32.583
- Can we talk?
- You want to talk?

37:36.487 --> 37:37.622
Talk.

37:43.828 --> 37:44.862
All right.

37:46.197 --> 37:47.732
Turns out you were right.

37:50.034 --> 37:53.471
From the outside, it looks
like I was dealt a winning hand,

37:53.537 --> 37:55.873
but I've played it wrong.

37:55.940 --> 38:00.144
You wanna know what my type is?
Scoundrels, really.

38:00.211 --> 38:03.814
Liars and cheats. I've dated them all.

38:04.415 --> 38:07.318
There are merits to those relationships, right?

38:07.385 --> 38:13.057
Because I get to be the perfect one
and they are always the problem.

38:13.124 --> 38:16.127
I'm never seen and I'm never checked.

38:16.193 --> 38:19.563
And then here you come
with all your probing questions.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.603
I mean, I put a lot of work
into putting this facade together.

38:25.670 --> 38:28.072
My own whole family has bought into it.

38:28.139 --> 38:31.342
It just feels like one look from you
and the whole thing can just...

38:34.045 --> 38:35.746
come tumbling down.

38:39.517 --> 38:43.320
So when I see you, Lee, I run.

38:43.387 --> 38:45.089
And I keep running.

38:45.956 --> 38:47.825
But it's so lonely.

38:50.561 --> 38:52.229
And I'm so tired.

38:52.296 --> 38:53.931
So stop running.

38:55.866 --> 38:57.234
Take a risk.

39:03.574 --> 39:05.342
What's in it for you?

39:06.977 --> 39:08.446
The answer to a riddle.

39:09.814 --> 39:12.516
A complicated American woman.

39:13.818 --> 39:16.153
My complicated American woman.

39:16.687 --> 39:19.056
- So you forgive me?
- I forgive you.

39:22.493 --> 39:25.362
Got it. Okay.

39:26.597 --> 39:29.333
- Hey.
- I gotta go.

39:32.403 --> 39:35.539
- What the hell is going on?
- What do you mean?

39:35.606 --> 39:37.174
Him. What's he doing here?

39:37.241 --> 39:40.144
- What are you talking about?
- Justin Talbot from CNN.

39:40.211 --> 39:44.715
Justin, as in
"got you fired Justin Asshole Talbot?"

39:45.516 --> 39:47.551
What is he doing here?

39:47.618 --> 39:50.855
I don't know, but I'm about to find out.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.395
What are you doing here?

39:59.563 --> 40:00.998
I'm the new senior producer.

40:03.067 --> 40:04.468
Producer? Here?

40:05.002 --> 40:06.837
When Ronda Sales calls and invites you

40:06.904 --> 40:08.806
on the biggest morning show
in the country,

40:11.542 --> 40:12.743
you answer.
