WEBVTT

01:33.468 --> 01:35.812
Ah, little scoundrel.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.150
There you are.
You are a bad boy.

01:40.142 --> 01:44.067
Come on.
Hop on.

01:44.146 --> 01:46.615
Like you always do.

01:57.909 --> 02:01.209
Holy sacraments!
You'll kill yourself!

02:19.264 --> 02:22.143
Only God knows how much
I loved you.

02:42.537 --> 02:45.211
- Someone has died.
- Huh-uh.

02:45.290 --> 02:49.921
- It's Pentecost.
- No no, it must be a very big fish

02:50.003 --> 02:53.098
if they are ringing
the cathedral bells.

02:54.383 --> 02:57.136
Florentino, lay down.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.980
Let's do it again.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.104
Please?

03:03.183 --> 03:06.813
Tolling like that must
be for a governor at least.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.444
Or...

03:09.523 --> 03:11.651
What?

03:14.778 --> 03:16.780
What is it?

03:31.461 --> 03:35.887
America, you must
go back to college.

03:37.426 --> 03:40.145
My driver will take you.
There is something I have to do.

03:42.681 --> 03:45.275
My deepest
sympathy.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.984
Your father
was a saint.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.780
- My condolences.
- I'm so sorry.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.498
We would still
have cholera

04:00.574 --> 04:03.794
if it had not
been for him.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.837
My sympathies,
Mrs. Urbino.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.382
Let's go, Mom.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.021
- See you all later, gentlemen.
- See you later.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.979
Mama, I'll stay
if you want me to.

04:55.045 --> 04:58.015
Fermina, I have waited

04:58.089 --> 05:00.808
for this opportunity
for 51 years,

05:00.884 --> 05:02.932
nine months
and four days.

05:05.347 --> 05:08.396
That is how long
I have loved you,

05:08.475 --> 05:11.069
from the first moment
I cast eyes on you until now.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.399
I repeat
to you once again

05:15.482 --> 05:19.328
my vow
of eternal fidelity

05:19.402 --> 05:22.030
and everlasting love.

05:24.866 --> 05:27.039
Florentino Ariza...

05:29.913 --> 05:32.166
get out of here!

05:35.085 --> 05:36.962
Get out!

05:38.880 --> 05:42.384
And don't show your face again for
the years of life that are left to you.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.891
And I hope there are
very few of them.

07:18.396 --> 07:21.320
Florentino Ariza!

07:27.489 --> 07:28.741
Florentino!

07:31.242 --> 07:32.835
Ah!

07:32.827 --> 07:35.330
- That's not a telegram, Carlos.
- Come on, come on.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.880
Deliver this, please,
to Sefior Lorenzo Daza.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.425
Old house,
Park of Evangels.

07:42.504 --> 07:45.348
New in town,
a rough diamond.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.848
Owns mules,
lots of mules.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.971
Thank you, Lotario.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.144
Thank you.

07:58.645 --> 08:02.616
Yes yes, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.828
Last time you charged me
400 gold pesos,

08:14.911 --> 08:18.085
that's double what I paid for this
whole abbey cloister-- what?!

08:18.164 --> 08:20.713
Sefior Lorenzo Daza.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.928
Yes.

08:27.549 --> 08:30.348
Oh, good news.
Good news!

08:32.386 --> 08:34.640
No reply-

08:34.722 --> 08:36.645
Look at the shape
of the letter.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.773
Not “U" but “A.”

08:38.852 --> 08:40.900
M-me--

08:40.979 --> 08:44.734
M-m--me--

Ta k-- mistook--

08:58.079 --> 09:00.628
<i>mistake-taken“</i>

09:00.707 --> 09:02.675
Good.
Good.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.424
Very good.

09:09.591 --> 09:12.435
Mistook, mistake,

09:12.510 --> 09:14.057
mistaken.

09:14.137 --> 09:17.482
- What do you want?
- Look, I didn't do anything.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.618
Don't you greet
your mother?

09:35.366 --> 09:37.243
Florentino,
have you eaten?

09:37.327 --> 09:39.455
Have you eaten?

09:47.796 --> 09:49.264
“Fermina Daza,

09:49.339 --> 09:51.137
for I have learned

09:51.132 --> 09:54.807
that is your majestic

09:54.803 --> 09:58.649
immortal name.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.021
I write
this very short note

10:01.101 --> 10:04.480
in order
to let you know...

10:05.897 --> 10:08.320
that I love you.”

10:08.316 --> 10:10.739
- You haven't been to bed.
- Shh!

10:10.819 --> 10:12.287
- Are you ill?
- No.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.364
You are so pale, my son.
Are you sure?

10:14.447 --> 10:16.996
- I'm not ill.
- Let me feel your head.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.744
Let me feel your head.

10:19.828 --> 10:22.672
What are you writing,
a book?

10:22.664 --> 10:25.042
No, a letter.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.925
All these pages,
and they're just one letter.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.880
But what kind of a letter?

10:32.173 --> 10:34.471
Holy Mother.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.064
It is a love letter.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.269
Oh, my son,
who is she?

10:43.351 --> 10:45.945
Her name is...

10:47.772 --> 10:49.695
Fermina Daza.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.697
They're new in town.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.412
Her mother is dead.
Her father owns mules.

10:54.487 --> 10:58.708
And, Mama, I have discovered
the reason for my existence.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.002
Don't talk such
nonsense, my son.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.454
That's it!

11:02.537 --> 11:04.710
Come on, come on,
come on.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.708
But there is money in mules.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.299
Does Fermina Daza
return your love?

11:10.378 --> 11:11.971
“L've discovered...”

11:12.046 --> 11:13.719
I don't know.
We haven't spoken.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.717
That's why I'm writing
the letter.

11:15.717 --> 11:18.140
If I can find the opportunity,
I'll give it to her,

11:18.219 --> 11:20.062
but she's always
with her aunt.

11:20.138 --> 11:24.143
Then you must
win over the aunt, not the girl.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.443
It's him!
It is the telegram boy.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.278
Walk on.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.148
Eh-hh.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.383
- Let me stand next to her.
- No!

12:35.713 --> 12:37.590
Sefiorita Daza,

12:37.674 --> 12:39.972
all I ask is that you accept
a letter from me.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.936
- Not now.
- When?

12:42.011 --> 12:44.184
Afterwards.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.942
Corpus Christi.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.942
- Corpus Christi.
- Amen.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.178
Welcome, Fernando!

13:18.631 --> 13:21.100
Papa, I'm going
to wish

13:21.175 --> 13:23.598
Mother Superior
a happy Christmas.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.690
This is the greatest moment
in my life.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.521
Give it to me.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.865
It was very long.
I made it shorter.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.365
Wait!

13:39.360 --> 13:41.408
It's a flower
of promising.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.615
Go.

13:43.698 --> 13:47.123
And don't see me again
until you hear from me.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.784
My Holy Mother.
My Holy Mother.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.112
It is cholera, my son.
It is cholera.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.868
- No, Mama.
- My son!

14:23.946 --> 14:27.041
I gave her the letter.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.622
Now I must wait
for her reply.

14:32.705 --> 14:36.255
Yeah.
Then enjoy your pain.

14:36.334 --> 14:39.838
Take advantage of it now
while you are young.

14:39.921 --> 14:43.425
And suffer, my son,
suffer all you can,

14:43.424 --> 14:46.394
because these things don't
last your whole life.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.391
May she answer soon.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.269
She won't.

15:06.114 --> 15:09.869
Florentino!

15:11.452 --> 15:12.999
What the hell
you are doing?

15:14.455 --> 15:16.799
It's not an American ship,
it's British.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.798
It's the mail from Liverpool.
British.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.881
Come here.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.563
What is wrong with you?
This isn't love.

15:30.638 --> 15:33.608
It's madness.
Give me, give me.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.360
Up LIP "P "P-

15:37.520 --> 15:39.898
No, wait wait.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.907
<i>“OW! go'</i>

15:48.406 --> 15:50.454
What is wrong
with you?

15:56.873 --> 15:59.171
You need to take
your mind off her.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.298
Come with me
to the whorehouse if--

16:14.891 --> 16:16.734
Yes?

16:16.809 --> 16:19.187
Oh, how much is it
to send a telegram

16:19.270 --> 16:20.863
to the village
of Piedras de Moler?

16:22.440 --> 16:24.534
- Piedras de Moler?
- Uh-huh.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.163
Uh... let me see.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.168
It's--
it's not on our list.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.713
You don't-- you don't
send telegrams to Piedras de Moler?

16:39.373 --> 16:42.627
- No.
- Th-- then--

16:45.922 --> 16:48.220
good day to you.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.307
Sefiorita!

17:11.739 --> 17:14.538
“Dear Florentino Ariza...

17:14.617 --> 17:16.290
I am sorry that I have

17:16.368 --> 17:19.167
made you wait so long
for my reply.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.590
I ask your forgiveness.

17:21.665 --> 17:24.589
Please, write to me
again soon.”

17:28.714 --> 17:31.217
“Crowned goddess, I enclose

17:31.300 --> 17:33.394
what I know is
a worthless memento.

17:33.469 --> 17:37.269
I also write this verse
in honor of my love for you.”

17:40.601 --> 17:43.024
“I think of you every moment.

17:43.104 --> 17:46.950
Now that spring is here,
thoughts of you fill me with life.

17:48.109 --> 17:49.952
I will love you forever.

17:49.944 --> 17:51.912
Forever.”

18:35.281 --> 18:37.249
Shh-hhh.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.380
Shhh.

19:11.067 --> 19:14.196
- It's him.
- Of course it's him.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.705
- Sefiorita Escoléstica?
- Shhh.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.874
Sefiorita Escoléstica,

19:22.953 --> 19:26.833
please turn apart so I can talk
privately to the young lady.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.339
I have something important
to ask her.

19:29.418 --> 19:32.217
What impertinence!

19:32.213 --> 19:35.057
There's nothing that has to do with her
that I cannot hear.

19:36.384 --> 19:38.057
Then I will not
say anything.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.887
But I warn you,

19:39.887 --> 19:42.561
you will be responsible
for the consequences.

19:47.311 --> 19:50.440
- Fermina Daza.
- I am here.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.571
We've written
too many letters

19:52.566 --> 19:54.819
and too much time
has passed.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.576
So now...

19:57.655 --> 20:00.329
crowned goddess,

20:00.408 --> 20:02.456
I make this vow.

20:02.535 --> 20:05.505
I swear to you
my eternal fidelity

20:05.579 --> 20:08.082
and everlasting love,

20:08.082 --> 20:10.926
and I ask in all humility

20:11.001 --> 20:15.131
to do me the great honor
of marrying me.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.552
You--

20:18.634 --> 20:21.763
you must give me time.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.231
Fermina, say yes!

20:24.306 --> 20:27.276
Fermina, I may not be married,
but I know about love.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.944
Even if you're
dying of fear,

20:28.936 --> 20:31.314
even if you are sorry later,
because whatever you do,

20:31.397 --> 20:33.946
you will be sorry
all the rest of your life if you say no.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.072
Believe me, I know
what I'm talking about.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.298
Yes, very well.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.634
I will marry you

20:51.625 --> 20:54.003
if you-- if you promise
not to make me eat

20:54.086 --> 20:55.838
eggplant.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.808
Who is he?
Who is he?

21:07.892 --> 21:09.735
Who is he?

21:12.104 --> 21:14.106
Who is this
Florentino Ariza?

21:14.190 --> 21:15.863
Huh?

21:15.941 --> 21:18.990
And Mother Superior
says that you write letters to him?

21:18.986 --> 21:21.409
And you-- you!

21:21.489 --> 21:23.617
You are to blame.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.721
No!

21:41.801 --> 21:44.395
Aunt!

21:53.729 --> 21:57.779
No!

22:12.998 --> 22:15.626
Daughter, daughter,
listen to your father.

22:15.709 --> 22:18.212
Listen to your father.
Everything I do,

22:18.295 --> 22:20.263
I do it because--

22:20.339 --> 22:21.966
because I--

22:22.049 --> 22:24.598
okay, I'll try.
I'll try, but--

22:24.677 --> 22:28.147
but I have to-- I have to ex--
I have to explain myself.

22:28.222 --> 22:31.647
I have to explain myself.
It's difficult because I'm a plain man.

22:35.437 --> 22:37.439
But ever since
your mother died,

22:37.523 --> 22:39.571
you've been--

22:39.567 --> 22:41.740
you've been...

22:41.735 --> 22:44.079
a daughter--
a daughter is a jewel.

22:44.071 --> 22:47.075
Is a jewel. I'm--
I'm-- I'm a rough diamond, but you're--

22:47.074 --> 22:50.419
you're--
you're the-- the crown.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.713
And I don't-- I don't--
I don't work for me.

22:52.788 --> 22:55.917
We didn't come here for me.
We came here for you.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.089
For you!

22:58.085 --> 23:00.213
But you don't know how--
just how beautiful you are.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.923
You-you-you--
you're-- you're--

23:02.006 --> 23:05.556
you're much too beautiful
to marry a telegraph operator.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.848
We have bigger fish to fry,
and believe me-- believe me,

23:10.931 --> 23:14.606
at your age,
love is an illusion.

23:19.273 --> 23:20.775
Christ, by Christ I swear,

23:20.774 --> 23:23.368
I swear,
I swear to Christ--

23:47.343 --> 23:49.437
Good morning,
good morning.

23:52.681 --> 23:55.810
You and I must talk--
man to man.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.110
Ahhhh.

24:04.193 --> 24:07.618
When my wife died
I set myself one goal.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.664
One goal--

24:09.740 --> 24:12.664
to turn my daughter
into a great lady.

24:12.743 --> 24:16.373
Now that's-- that's a long road
to travel for a mule trader.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.799
I've never had a drink
this early in the morning.

24:18.874 --> 24:21.923
Better start now.
You're going to need it.

24:27.007 --> 24:29.305
I came to this town
because...

24:29.385 --> 24:32.138
well, here was the possibility
of a grand marriage.

24:32.221 --> 24:35.100
Then an unforeseen
obstacle

24:35.182 --> 24:38.026
to the plan that I have
fought for with my life...

24:39.019 --> 24:41.113
YOu.

24:42.856 --> 24:45.075
So I've come to make
a polite request.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.120
Get out of our way.

24:49.196 --> 24:51.369
Have you spoken to her?

24:51.365 --> 24:53.709
None of that. None of that.
This is a matter for men

24:53.701 --> 24:56.045
and it will be decided
by men.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.840
Be that as it may,

24:59.915 --> 25:02.964
I cannot answer without knowing
what she thinks.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.676
Don't force me
to shoot you.

25:12.803 --> 25:15.056
Shoot me.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.899
There is no greater glory
than to die for love.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.442
Pack!

25:22.521 --> 25:25.024
- Where are we going?
- To our death!

25:25.107 --> 25:27.485
You'd better explain.
I'm not leaving.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.889
Take it to him now.

25:57.139 --> 25:58.891
- What is this?
- They leaving.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.772
They going
to the country.

26:08.692 --> 26:11.616
- Hurry up!
- Where are you going?

26:11.695 --> 26:13.322
He's taking me away.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.406
- Sit down!
- Fermina.

26:14.490 --> 26:16.743
Don't you dare
talk to him!

26:16.825 --> 26:20.420
- Where are you talking her?
- He's taking me away!

26:20.496 --> 26:22.874
Get out of our way.

26:22.956 --> 26:24.754
Hyah!
Hyah!

26:28.045 --> 26:30.264
Get back.
Get back.

26:32.049 --> 26:36.020
P I think of you
every day P

26:41.683 --> 26:45.813
P I think of you
a little bit more <i>P</i>

26:51.485 --> 26:55.865
I' I tear my reason apart I'

27:01.161 --> 27:05.541
I' Something inside me
gets destroyed P

27:09.336 --> 27:10.758
C'mon, mule.

27:10.838 --> 27:15.139
P I think of you
every day P

27:20.764 --> 27:24.940
P I think of you
a little bit more <i>P</i>

27:30.023 --> 27:34.494
I' And I keep
thinking of you P

27:39.366 --> 27:43.712
I' And I keep
thinking. <i>P</i>

27:48.834 --> 27:52.338
- That's bad. Five more.
- Take away all I have, right?

28:03.265 --> 28:05.393
Aunt Fermina!

28:06.393 --> 28:08.066
Sefiora, may I help you?

28:08.145 --> 28:11.524
Hi, princess,
What are you here for?

28:16.486 --> 28:18.784
Cousin Fermina?

28:20.532 --> 28:22.455
I have a surprise for you.

28:36.924 --> 28:38.801
Cousin.

28:56.276 --> 28:59.280
He wants me to fix
a wedding date.

28:59.279 --> 29:01.748
- Will you?
- Of course.

29:01.823 --> 29:05.123
- Excuse me, Sefioritas.
- Make it well into the future.

29:05.118 --> 29:09.339
Your father said he will
keep you here for a year at least.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.175
A year is nothing.

29:13.377 --> 29:15.379
We will exchange telegrams

29:15.462 --> 29:17.806
as we used to exchange
letters.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.226
And our love will triumph.

29:22.552 --> 29:26.056
There is no man on Earth more
perfect than Florentino Ariza.

29:28.058 --> 29:30.481
And you, Hildebranda,
are you in love?

29:36.233 --> 29:37.906
A married man.

29:39.486 --> 29:42.410
20 years older than me.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.334
Do you
exchange letters?

29:50.414 --> 29:52.667
No.

29:52.666 --> 29:55.670
Secret glances.

29:58.422 --> 30:00.516
It all seems difficult
and impossible now,

30:00.590 --> 30:04.970
but I just know that we must
learn to be happy without love.

30:05.053 --> 30:07.226
And in spite of it.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.400
Happy without love?

30:09.474 --> 30:11.818
Yes.

30:13.228 --> 30:14.821
Happy without love.

30:16.440 --> 30:19.193
I want to eat the tender flesh

30:19.276 --> 30:22.075
of every word
she has written to me

30:22.154 --> 30:25.658
over and over.
I hope I survive.

30:25.741 --> 30:27.835
- But danger is everywhere.
- Fire!

30:29.286 --> 30:32.210
If the suffering of your own
heart doesn't kill you,

30:32.205 --> 30:36.051
the ever-recurring
civil war might.

30:36.043 --> 30:38.216
And there is the disease

30:38.211 --> 30:41.590
that comes between
the burst of bloodshed,

30:41.673 --> 30:44.722
the deadly choking embrace
of cholera.

30:44.718 --> 30:49.098
Dead collectors!
My daughter is--

30:49.181 --> 30:52.355
She is even more impossible
to predict than war.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.357
She grabs hold,

30:54.436 --> 30:56.859
then suddenly she lets go.

30:56.938 --> 31:00.158
- Daddy! He's dead, too.
- She grabs hold,

31:00.233 --> 31:02.076
she lets go.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.579
Florentino!

31:11.578 --> 31:14.001
UP here!

31:30.597 --> 31:33.601
Stop it, stop it.
It will be all three of you, I promise.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.228
All in good time.

31:37.979 --> 31:40.653
So which one
is it going to be?

31:40.732 --> 31:44.157
No no, my beloved
is returning soon.

31:44.236 --> 31:47.206
I have to keep myself pure.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.499
And I will only lose
my virginity for love.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.793
Oooh.

31:51.785 --> 31:55.164
That is such a bad idea.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.129
Don't go, Florentino.

31:59.126 --> 32:02.300
I will be back--
but not for some time.

32:02.379 --> 32:05.679
Let's go, let's go.

32:27.571 --> 32:30.324
So the worst years
of my life passed.

32:30.407 --> 32:33.456
I counted the eternal minutes
one by one

32:33.535 --> 32:35.503
as I waited for her return.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.748
But I do not mind.

32:37.831 --> 32:40.801
I will keep watch
for all of eternity.

32:40.876 --> 32:44.471
I will keep watch
until I die if need be.

32:49.176 --> 32:51.804
I stand vigil for her
beside the lighthouse.

32:51.887 --> 32:56.563
My heart is like the sea--
endless and everlasting,

32:56.641 --> 32:59.645
even while it is as turbulent
as the crashing waves.

33:01.021 --> 33:03.240
Florentino, what are
you doing here?

33:03.315 --> 33:06.865
Ricardo, the young lady I'm going
to marry is coming back tonight.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.362
I'm waiting for her.

33:08.445 --> 33:11.369
Come on.
Come on!

33:11.364 --> 33:14.709
Ricardo the lighthouse keeper
is my only friend.

33:14.701 --> 33:17.045
He does not understand.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.839
I must be here
to will her home.

33:31.676 --> 33:34.771
I delegate to you the authority
to run this household...

33:35.889 --> 33:39.018
and turn over to you
the keys to your life.

33:56.409 --> 34:00.084
Crowned goddess, you are
the coming of the dawn.

34:00.080 --> 34:03.584
Like spring, you have
returned to the one newborn.

34:17.429 --> 34:21.105
Mom, Mom, there it is, Mom!
Yes, yes. Come on, come on.

34:21.184 --> 34:25.109
- That one, too? That one.
- No no, that one over there.

34:39.244 --> 34:40.962
Thank you.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.292
Coconut candy!

34:46.960 --> 34:49.839
Sweets for your sweetie.

34:51.047 --> 34:53.219
Coconut candy!

34:54.842 --> 34:58.473
The Arcade of Scribes is not
a place for a crowned goddess.

35:10.817 --> 35:12.865
No.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.663
No, please.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.662
Forget it.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.833
Wh-wh-what do you mean
“forget it”?

35:25.123 --> 35:27.672
I just--

35:27.667 --> 35:29.886
I just realized

35:29.961 --> 35:33.636
this-- this moment
when I saw you.

35:33.715 --> 35:34.887
What?

35:34.966 --> 35:37.389
What did you realize?

35:40.347 --> 35:43.851
What is between us...

35:45.477 --> 35:48.151
is nothing more
than an illusion.

35:49.773 --> 35:52.242
It-- it clouded
my eyes.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.945
I'm so sorry.

35:59.532 --> 36:02.160
You-- you just...

36:02.243 --> 36:04.245
realized it?

36:06.164 --> 36:08.132
Yes.

36:10.585 --> 36:13.008
The moment I saw you.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.399
Make him well.

36:33.441 --> 36:36.160
Please.

36:46.246 --> 36:49.045
- Dr. Juvenal Urbino?
- He's a busy man.

36:49.124 --> 36:52.003
- This is urgent.
- No. Appointments only.

36:52.085 --> 36:55.635
Cholera-- my mistress
has cholera.

36:55.714 --> 36:58.433
No, you can't go up there.
You need to wear a mask.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.607
I'm Hildebranda Sanchez,
the patient's cousin.

37:06.599 --> 37:09.102
She's upstairs.

37:13.648 --> 37:16.447
I would like you to be present, please,
when I examine her.

37:16.443 --> 37:18.571
Her father's with her.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.617
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for coming.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.418
I pray to God
you can do something.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.791
They say you know more
about cholera than a--

37:42.135 --> 37:44.308
Under the tongue.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.809
Vomiting?

37:49.893 --> 37:51.816
How many times?
Once, twice?

37:51.895 --> 37:53.522
Twice.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.284
Diarrhea?

37:59.277 --> 38:01.621
- Severe?
- I don't--

38:01.696 --> 38:03.323
- What?
- I-- I don't know.

38:03.323 --> 38:04.870
I've never had it before.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.038
Sit up, please.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.872
It is an intestinal
infection.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.955
What?
It's not cholera?

38:48.034 --> 38:49.877
No.
I'll prescribe medicine.

38:49.869 --> 38:53.248
Three days at home
and she'll be well again.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.710
Did you hear that?
Oh.

38:58.711 --> 39:00.839
Doctor, wait wait.

39:00.922 --> 39:04.096
Doctor, wait! How did you learn
so much about cholera?

39:04.175 --> 39:07.600
I, uh, studied in Paris
under Professor Proust.

39:07.679 --> 39:10.398
All the things you've done
for the city-- the clean water,

39:10.390 --> 39:12.233
- closed sewage--
- Your daughter.

39:12.225 --> 39:14.444
- Yes?
- She's very beautiful.

39:23.444 --> 39:25.742
Thank you.

39:41.629 --> 39:43.427
Sefiorita.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.392
I would like to, um...

39:46.467 --> 39:48.390
take your pulse.

40:01.858 --> 40:04.202
Stick out
your tongue, please.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.661
Mm-hmm.

40:11.326 --> 40:14.626
You are like a--
a new-sprung rose.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.373
Thank you.

40:16.456 --> 40:18.458
Do you like music?

40:18.541 --> 40:20.293
What is the point
of that question?

40:20.376 --> 40:22.470
Music is important
for one's health.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.978
No! No, don't!
Doctor!

40:31.054 --> 40:33.728
Do not go.
I saw it all.

40:33.806 --> 40:35.479
I saw it all.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.777
L-- I told your daughter
that she is like a rose.

40:37.852 --> 40:40.025
True enough, but one
with too many thorns.

40:43.524 --> 40:46.494
Up up up!
You open that window and apologize.

40:46.486 --> 40:49.990
I have nothing to apologize for.
I closed the window to keep out the sun.

40:49.989 --> 40:51.991
Don't backtalk back to me, okay?
Do as I tell you.

40:57.330 --> 41:00.129
Say something... now!

41:02.502 --> 41:06.348
I offer you my most
heartfelt apology, sir.

41:10.009 --> 41:11.932
Her education.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.816
Let me escort you
to the carriage.

41:31.948 --> 41:34.167
Sefion

41:34.242 --> 41:36.836
I-- I would like
your permission

41:36.911 --> 41:38.879
to write
to your daughter.

41:40.707 --> 41:43.426
Ahh.

41:47.255 --> 41:50.600
I will go and find her.
I won't let her go.

41:50.675 --> 41:54.054
My destiny in life
is to love Fermina.

41:54.137 --> 41:56.560
I will win her back.

42:01.060 --> 42:02.937
Hildebranda, look!

42:03.938 --> 42:07.192
Aye, beautiful!

42:07.275 --> 42:09.277
Mmmmm,
another one.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.783
Gala Placidia, I told you
not to accept it.

42:11.863 --> 42:14.207
Oh, I know that,
milady,

42:14.282 --> 42:17.912
but is hard to say
no to Dr. Urbino.

42:17.910 --> 42:19.753
How many is that now?

42:19.746 --> 42:21.339
Seven.

42:21.414 --> 42:24.918
- You must reply.
- We're not going to discuss it.

42:24.917 --> 42:26.635
We must hurry.

42:26.711 --> 42:29.590
The Belgian photographer
is expecting us.

42:29.589 --> 42:31.683
Gala Placidia,
help us to dress.

42:31.758 --> 42:34.728
Oh, yes, milady,
it is perfect.

42:45.021 --> 42:46.989
Ladies, very still.

42:49.275 --> 42:52.119
I will count
to five now.

42:52.111 --> 42:56.537
One, two, three...

42:56.616 --> 42:59.540
four, five.

43:05.875 --> 43:08.719
One, two, three!

43:09.754 --> 43:11.802
Benny Centeno!

43:24.143 --> 43:27.067
Benny, Benny, Benny...

43:38.991 --> 43:41.619
Move aside!
Move aside!

43:41.702 --> 43:44.080
Benny!
Champion!

43:44.163 --> 43:46.257
Please get in, I'll take you
wherever you want to go.

43:46.332 --> 43:48.175
Benny, Benny, Benny!

44:09.188 --> 44:11.566
Who is Benny Centeno?

44:12.942 --> 44:16.492
He just won the boxing
championship in Panama.

44:16.571 --> 44:17.823
Oh.

44:17.905 --> 44:20.374
This is so nice.

44:20.366 --> 44:23.040
I could spend the rest
of my life here.

44:27.832 --> 44:30.836
Oh, ay, my boots
are killing me.

44:33.004 --> 44:35.473
I'll have to take them off.

44:35.548 --> 44:37.141
I'll take off mine too.

44:37.216 --> 44:38.889
Let's see who
finishes first.

44:42.221 --> 44:44.849
Oh!

44:44.932 --> 44:46.559
Mmm.

44:46.559 --> 44:48.812
You won.
You won.

44:51.522 --> 44:54.241
But now I realize it
wasn't my boots at all.

44:55.526 --> 44:58.325
It is this wire cage
under my skirt.

44:58.404 --> 45:00.998
Hmm, nothing could
be simpler.

45:01.073 --> 45:03.292
Take it off.

45:04.368 --> 45:06.587
I won't look.

45:09.248 --> 45:10.750
Ay!

45:12.668 --> 45:14.670
I am waiting.

45:14.754 --> 45:16.427
We want to go home.

45:24.805 --> 45:26.807
Whoa whoa whoa.

45:31.437 --> 45:35.283
Read my letters.
I want your answer.

45:45.451 --> 45:48.421
He's very beautiful.

45:48.496 --> 45:52.922
When he covered his eyes
and I saw his perfect teeth

45:53.000 --> 45:56.300
between those rosy lips,
I wanted--

45:56.379 --> 45:58.632
oooh,eeeoh.

46:02.301 --> 46:05.305
I wanted to devour him
with kisses.

46:06.347 --> 46:08.896
What a whore you are.

46:29.620 --> 46:31.714
“Dear Sefior Urbino,

46:31.789 --> 46:34.838
I give you my permission

46:34.834 --> 46:36.836
to speak to my father.”

47:14.373 --> 47:16.842
Sefiora.

47:16.917 --> 47:20.592
Forgive me for keeping
you waiting, Transito,

47:20.671 --> 47:22.719
but I have to practice
my singing.

47:22.798 --> 47:25.426
You never know when there's
going to be a funeral, eh?

47:25.509 --> 47:27.386
But, please please.

47:30.139 --> 47:32.233
So...

47:32.224 --> 47:34.727
is there a problem?

47:34.810 --> 47:37.233
You get the money
I send each month?

47:37.313 --> 47:40.283
Thank you.
You are a kind man, Don Leo.

47:40.358 --> 47:42.577
I am not kind.
I am just,

47:42.651 --> 47:45.825
unlike my brother Pius.
Something had to be done.

47:45.905 --> 47:49.330
Pius should have made
a proper provision for my son.

47:49.408 --> 47:51.752
Well, he did not
and I did.

47:51.827 --> 47:53.625
So?

47:53.704 --> 47:56.173
I've come...

47:56.248 --> 47:59.092
to ask if
you can help him.

47:59.168 --> 48:00.920
- Who?
- Your nephew.

48:01.003 --> 48:02.471
My son Florentino.

48:02.546 --> 48:05.095
What kind of help?

48:07.551 --> 48:09.269
A job.

48:09.345 --> 48:11.518
Well, I thought he had a job
at the telegraph office.

48:11.597 --> 48:14.316
Yes, but I'm asking you
to find him another job--

48:14.392 --> 48:17.111
any job, as long as
it's far away.

48:17.186 --> 48:19.564
Some port lost
in the jungle where--

48:19.647 --> 48:22.400
where there is no mail,
no telegraph.

48:24.777 --> 48:27.121
A broken heart.

48:27.113 --> 48:28.660
Yeah.

48:44.463 --> 48:46.010
Hmm.

48:47.800 --> 48:51.646
Hmmm.
How about Villa de Leyva?

48:51.637 --> 48:53.480
How far away is that?

48:54.890 --> 48:56.813
Oh...

49:00.479 --> 49:02.481
about three weeks.

49:08.028 --> 49:10.156
I am nothing.

49:10.239 --> 49:12.662
I will not heal--

49:12.658 --> 49:15.161
not for all time.

49:15.244 --> 49:18.464
I'm struck by
the lightning of love

49:18.539 --> 49:20.712
and burned beyond repair.

49:22.751 --> 49:25.345
She's a splinter that
cannot be pulled out.

49:25.337 --> 49:28.432
She's part of me,
everywhere I go.

49:28.507 --> 49:30.601
Everywhere, she is.

49:40.728 --> 49:44.904
- Hello.
- Fermina.

50:00.748 --> 50:02.796
What are you doing?

50:04.126 --> 50:06.254
Turn off the light.

50:19.141 --> 50:21.064
I want...

50:21.143 --> 50:23.237
absolute darkness.

50:24.897 --> 50:27.150
You forget, Doctor,
this is the first time

50:27.233 --> 50:28.951
I've slept
with a stranger.

50:35.699 --> 50:38.077
Do you love me?

50:39.078 --> 50:40.671
Don't be frightened.

50:40.746 --> 50:44.091
We are man and wife.

50:44.166 --> 50:46.419
I want you to love every...

50:46.418 --> 50:48.295
every moment
of our honeymoon.

50:50.631 --> 50:52.884
I can't wait
to show you Paris.

50:52.967 --> 50:55.186
It is a...

50:55.261 --> 50:57.639
a city of love.

51:02.101 --> 51:04.820
You have

51:04.895 --> 51:07.739
a beautiful smile.

51:07.815 --> 51:10.193
Thank you.

51:11.860 --> 51:13.908
I think my sense of smell

51:13.988 --> 51:16.707
is overdeveloped.

51:16.782 --> 51:19.080
Well, that would be because
your olfactory organ's--

51:19.159 --> 51:21.253
I'm sorry
I mentioned it.

51:32.965 --> 51:35.184
Shhh.

51:37.052 --> 51:38.975
Don't forget I have
met them before.

51:39.054 --> 51:41.557
I remember it
very well.

51:41.640 --> 51:44.439
And I'm still angry.

52:06.206 --> 52:09.801
L've-- I've never been able to
understand how your thing works.

52:13.839 --> 52:16.592
How ugly it is.

52:19.553 --> 52:23.023
Even uglier than
a woman's thing.

52:23.015 --> 52:25.518
Yes.

52:25.517 --> 52:27.861
Besides, I think it has...

52:27.853 --> 52:30.026
too many bits on it.

52:30.022 --> 52:32.070
That's astounding.

52:32.149 --> 52:35.028
My doctoral thesis was
on the advantage--

52:35.027 --> 52:38.281
I don't want
a medical lesson.

52:39.365 --> 52:41.663
No. No.

52:41.742 --> 52:44.871
This is going to be
a lesson in love.

53:04.139 --> 53:05.891
The black flag!

53:08.268 --> 53:11.067
That's the plague flag.
Give them a wide berth.

53:12.981 --> 53:15.404
Please, help us!

53:15.484 --> 53:17.987
Captain!

53:18.070 --> 53:21.290
- They're dying of cholera!
- Cholera!

53:21.365 --> 53:24.244
Please!

53:24.326 --> 53:26.374
Good Heavens! Careful,
don't get too close...

53:26.453 --> 53:29.377
Please, help us!

53:29.456 --> 53:32.426
Captain! Help us!

53:33.794 --> 53:35.091
Cholera!

53:35.170 --> 53:39.471
Help me! Please.

53:39.550 --> 53:40.767
Don't leave.

53:40.759 --> 53:42.978
God! What's that?

53:43.053 --> 53:45.852
Help me! Please!

53:51.019 --> 53:54.444
Keep her safe, protect her
from harm.

53:56.483 --> 53:58.952
Good night,
my crowned goddess.

54:47.826 --> 54:50.079
Go go.
Go on and forget all about it.

54:50.162 --> 54:52.005
This never happened.

55:14.186 --> 55:16.735
Who occupies that cabin--
the middle one?

55:16.814 --> 55:19.317
- Three women.
- Three women?

55:19.399 --> 55:23.575
They have three cabins
and they both connect together.

55:23.654 --> 55:25.907
It makes one big one.

55:27.908 --> 55:31.128
- Who are they, these women?
- I don't know.

55:33.080 --> 55:35.048
- You go on.
- We'll see.

55:53.892 --> 55:57.066
- See her eyes?
- My, Rosalba.

55:57.062 --> 55:59.190
He looks very sweet.

55:59.273 --> 56:01.241
And so shy.

56:01.316 --> 56:03.489
It's the shy ones
you must look out for.

56:56.288 --> 56:59.963
- Carefully, it's fragile.
- Get out of the way.

57:15.641 --> 57:18.269
He's staring at you.

57:20.938 --> 57:22.656
Bye!

57:55.013 --> 57:57.892
Fermina, my vow...

57:57.975 --> 58:01.354
I've broken my vow.

58:15.492 --> 58:18.041
You shouldn't have
come back, my son.

58:18.120 --> 58:20.339
I had to.

58:20.414 --> 58:22.542
Why?

58:22.541 --> 58:24.509
Something happened and...

58:24.584 --> 58:27.463
I had to be near
Fermina again, Mama.

58:27.546 --> 58:30.641
- That's all.
- But she's not here.

58:33.927 --> 58:36.476
What do you mean
she's not here?

58:36.555 --> 58:40.230
She's in Paris
on her honeymoon.

58:40.225 --> 58:43.570
She'll be gone a long time--
more than one year.

58:45.188 --> 58:48.442
Maybe two years.

58:48.525 --> 58:51.074
- That's not true, Mama.
- It is true, my son.

58:51.153 --> 58:53.372
- No.
- It is true.

58:53.447 --> 58:55.700
At least two years.

59:01.163 --> 59:04.042
- No.
- No, Mama.

59:04.124 --> 59:06.422
Please don't cry.

59:06.418 --> 59:08.386
Oh.

59:10.839 --> 59:13.683
Please...
please don't waste your life.

59:15.093 --> 59:17.061
You must forget her.

59:18.930 --> 59:22.400
You must find someone else
who will help you forget.

59:22.476 --> 59:25.104
I can't forget, Mama.

59:25.103 --> 59:28.778
I will
never forget, Mama.

59:28.774 --> 59:31.152
I will never forget, Mama.

59:37.699 --> 59:41.044
Sefiora, sefiora!
Be careful! Sefiora!

59:41.119 --> 59:43.998
- Sefiora.
- Come on, boys.

59:54.257 --> 59:57.010
Open fire!

59:59.513 --> 01:00:02.232
They destroyed my house,
Transito!

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.939
They destroyed my house.

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:06.611
Come in.

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:09.565
I need a bed--

01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:11.650
on the floor, anywhere.

01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:14.407
Just until I can
rebuild my house.

01:00:16.238 --> 01:00:19.242
Who knows how long
this war will last.

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:23.545
Come on, drink.

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:33.926
You must stay here.

01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:36.758
- So you have the room?
- No.

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:39.391
It is a shame.
My own bedroom is too small.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:42.097
But if you don't mind...

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.933
sharing with my son.

01:00:51.523 --> 01:00:53.150
Florentino?

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:55.110
An emergency.

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:59.957
The Widow Nazaret,
her house has been damaged.

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:03.001
War has no respect
for anybody.

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:06.376
She needs a bed.
You can sleep in your hammock.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:15.468
L'm so scared!

01:01:15.547 --> 01:01:18.016
If it wasn't enough
to lose my husband,

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:21.561
now this.

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:28.401
He died three years ago.

01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:41.915
Help me, help me.

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:44.493
My dead husband
always undid my laces.

01:01:44.576 --> 01:01:46.544
Help me, please.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.089
Help me.

01:01:53.168 --> 01:01:55.262
I've never been
in the same bed

01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:57.847
with any other man--

01:01:57.923 --> 01:02:01.268
ay-- other than
my dead husband.

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:06.765
He's in his coffin now

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:08.896
under the ground.

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:12.316
L'm so happy!

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:15.774
I'm happy
because only now

01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:17.367
do I know for certain

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:18.864
where he is

01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:20.912
when he's not at...

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:23.285
home!

01:02:36.628 --> 01:02:38.301
Women.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.729
Number one...

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:52.318
unknown lady in boat.

01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:57.403
The first...

01:02:57.482 --> 01:02:59.450
wondrous...

01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:03.659
explosion.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:08.289
Number two...

01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:10.462
the Widow Nazaret--

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.594
while doing it,

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:19.637
only talks of
her dead husband.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:23.763
Number three...

01:03:26.177 --> 01:03:28.475
Esmeralda Arau--

01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:30.057
a skinny,
wiggling tadpole

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.813
who'd walk me
through the ferns.

01:03:35.854 --> 01:03:37.527
Number four...

01:03:37.522 --> 01:03:39.365
Maria Estevez--

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:41.443
very dangerous.

01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:43.278
We were so close
to the street,

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:45.238
anyone could
have heard us.

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:49.909
This is the cure
for the pain

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:51.620
of Fermina.

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:01.421
What is it?

01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:06.472
Nothing, my son, nothing.

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:10.184
- For a moment I--
- What?

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:13.058
I didn't know
who you were.

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:16.144
It happens to me
more and more,

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:18.070
but it-- it goes.

01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:20.236
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

01:04:20.231 --> 01:04:22.074
Ma-- I have work
to do, Mama.

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:27.198
Work? What work?
You need to find a job and to get paid.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.408
I can't keep you forever.

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.544
L-- I-- I have
something to tell you.

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:34.838
You are going
to marry the widow.

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:36.381
Oh, no.

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:38.925
- What did you say?
- Ma-- Mama--

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.674
Did you say you had
something to tell me?

01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:45.132
Yes, I honestly believe...

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:47.513
I'm getting over the worst.

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:50.807
What was her name again?

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:53.310
Fermina.
Fermina.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.643
Fermina.

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:57.318
I begin to feel free.

01:04:57.394 --> 01:04:59.863
The pain is gone.
It's gone.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:11.120
Now, it took Paris,
the city of love, to bring about

01:05:11.199 --> 01:05:13.793
this blessed
transformation.

01:05:13.785 --> 01:05:16.834
But here we are
amongst our dearest friends.

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:19.666
We are happier than
you can know to be here.

01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:24.509
And furthermore,
we are overjoyed

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:27.181
to no longer
be two, but three.

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:34.807
The great purpose
of marriage has made itself clear to all

01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:37.480
and we thank you,
our dear friends, for your warmth

01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:39.732
and your congratulations.

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:09.383
Well, I was wondering
how long it would be

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:11.184
before you came begging me.

01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:13.512
- What do you want?
- A job.

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:14.847
<i>L</i> gave you a job...

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:16.727
at Villa de Leyva
and you threw it away.

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:18.353
It is different now.

01:06:18.433 --> 01:06:20.936
I want to be
rich like you.

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:22.487
I am not rich.

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:24.189
L'm a poor man with money

01:06:24.272 --> 01:06:25.899
which is not the same thing.

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:32.285
Why do you
want to be rich?

01:06:32.363 --> 01:06:33.910
So that I can be
someone in society,

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:37.870
I need-- I need to be worthy
of a great lady I cannot stop loving.

01:06:38.912 --> 01:06:40.459
Who is she?

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:43.758
Married?

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.676
Yes, but I'm waiting
for her husband to die.

01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:46.844
Is he old?

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.513
No, but <i>l'll</i> wait
for however long it takes.

01:06:48.588 --> 01:06:50.090
- You're crazy.
- Why?

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:51.720
Because insanity
runs in the family.

01:06:51.716 --> 01:06:53.343
You take after
your father.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.929
You never knew him,
my brother Pius.

01:06:58.306 --> 01:07:00.684
You know what
his last words were?

01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:04.271
He said “The only regret I have
in dying is that I do not die for love.”

01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:09.742
He said that?

01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:12.157
- He really said that?
- On his deathbed.

01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:14.911
Nevertheless, all his life he fucked
everything in sight.

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:19.665
So...

01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:22.463
you want a job in the River
Company of the Caribbean.

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:25.754
Yes, yes.

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:28.006
Well, are you any good

01:07:28.086 --> 01:07:29.838
at, um, writing letters?

01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:31.719
I think so, I--

01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:33.471
I-- I write poetry, too

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.973
I enter a poem every year
in the Poetic Festival.

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:38.350
I have never won, but--

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:40.773
So, you have a way
with words, huh?

01:07:40.765 --> 01:07:42.517
- Yes.
- Good.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.602
Perhaps you can tell me

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:46.438
what this means.

01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:47.905
On my birthday last year

01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:49.824
someone made
a speech in my honor.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:53.278
He said I suffered
from lucid dementia.

01:07:53.361 --> 01:07:54.829
Now what does that mean?

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:57.953
Lucid dementia
means you are clearly crazy.

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:11.596
I told you it
ran in the family.

01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:18.223
Start tomorrow.
Clerk to the board of directors.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:22.060
Tamales! Tamales!

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.484
Magic inks.

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:26.523
Very light blow.

01:08:26.603 --> 01:08:29.982
Invisible ink
for your secret letter.

01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:33.734
Sir?

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:36.826
I <i>'</i> I

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:39.828
- I would like--
- You don't have to say anything.

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:44.670
Does she know
you love her?

01:08:46.163 --> 01:08:47.666
Yes.

01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:53.964
Yes, and of course,
she loves you.

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:55.890
Yes.

01:08:57.841 --> 01:08:59.219
Do her parents know?

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.680
No, they don't.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:07.022
What do you call her?

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:10.446
My flower.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.444
All right, this is
what you could say.

01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:18.325
“My beautiful

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:20.657
and beloved flower.

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:27.714
Nobody can cut

01:09:27.788 --> 01:09:29.631
the stem

01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:31.584
of our love.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.888
My life, my soul,

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:37.055
be strong.

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:38.724
Don't give up.”

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:40.559
I baptize you in
the name of the Father...

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:42.895
“Don't give up.”

01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:51.645
I can't read or write.

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:54.566
- Don't worry, I can.
- I got this.

01:09:54.649 --> 01:09:57.869
Would you read it to me
and maybe write an answer?

01:09:57.944 --> 01:09:59.446
Yeah.

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:03.207
“My beautiful
and beloved flower.

01:10:05.618 --> 01:10:07.791
No one can cut the stem

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.918
of our love.

01:10:09.914 --> 01:10:13.589
My soul,
my life, be strong.

01:10:14.919 --> 01:10:17.172
Don't give up

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:19.428
because our love is deeper

01:10:19.507 --> 01:10:21.054
than the deepest ocean.
Emilio.”

01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:25.560
That's--
that's a wonderful letter.

01:10:25.638 --> 01:10:27.436
That's a wonderful letter.

01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:31.276
I know just what
your answer should be.

01:10:31.269 --> 01:10:34.569
This must stop.

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:36.820
- This must stop.
- What must stop?

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:43.373
“Our coffee comes
in strong brown sacks.

01:10:43.448 --> 01:10:45.792
Load well, but never
tire your backs.

01:10:45.867 --> 01:10:48.040
Unload in Miami,
these coffee beans

01:10:48.119 --> 01:10:49.541
and keep them dry...

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:52.464
- ...by any means.”
- What do you call this?

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:55.419
- A-a bill of lading.
- A bill of lading?

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:57.344
- Yes.
- In rhyme?

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.967
Yes.

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:04.177
And this- “To James Robinson
and Company, Lombard Street,

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:07.139
London, England.
Beloved sirs.

01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:09.687
I write with all
the ardor I can muster

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:13.145
to thank you for your exquisite letter
of 16th Aug.

01:11:13.144 --> 01:11:15.647
My heart beat faster
as I read each word.

01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:18.404
Oh, sirs, with all
tenderness at my disposal,

01:11:18.483 --> 01:11:22.113
I kiss and embrace you
and sign myself, dare I say...”

01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:24.744
“...Adoringly.”

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:28.208
This is not a business letter.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:30.286
This is a love letter.

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:32.588
Love is the only thing
that interests me.

01:11:32.663 --> 01:11:34.461
Hmm.

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.042
Well, the trouble is

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.344
without the river navigation,
there is no love.

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:40.387
It must stop.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.306
If you can't write
a straightforward business letter,

01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:45.134
you will be put
to picking up trash on the dock.

01:11:45.218 --> 01:11:47.016
But I need love.

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:50.390
Don Leo, I need love.

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:56.320
I need love.

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:06.489
Dofia Blanca.

01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:09.075
- Good afternoon.
- Dofia Blanca, so nice to see you.

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:11.832
- You look wonderful, Dofia Blanca.
- You know my daughter-in-law?

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:13.879
Yes, of course, Dofia Blanca.

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:15.464
Oh, my daughter was
at school with her.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.338
Yes, we paint at the park.

01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:19.384
We met in Paris.

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.007
I thought her charming.

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:27.393
She has, alas,

01:12:27.385 --> 01:12:29.183
a scandal in her family.

01:12:29.262 --> 01:12:32.562
- Mother, please.
- Apparently, there is no law,

01:12:32.557 --> 01:12:34.559
human or divine,

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:37.403
her father
has not ignored.

01:12:37.478 --> 01:12:39.105
And now he's run away.

01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:43.072
It's only to be expected
from mules.

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:48.702
She does not
eat eggplant...

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:51.125
and does not
play the piano.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.998
But she is learning
the harp.

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:55.455
- Oh, do play for us.
- Yes.

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:59.259
- Oh, do, please, yes.
- I think not.

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:01.506
Serve the tea.

01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:08.722
Well, what news
from the great world?

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:12.601
Don Leo XII of the River Company
says he's going to retire!

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.933
Oh, he's been
saying that for years.

01:13:15.016 --> 01:13:17.860
And if he does,
who will succeed him?

01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:20.279
- Oh, he has a nephew.
- An illegitimate nephew.

01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:21.856
- Florentino Ariza.
- Mmm.

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:23.532
Do we know him?

01:13:23.608 --> 01:13:25.485
I've seen him many times,

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:27.866
but I can't remember
what he looks like.

01:13:30.323 --> 01:13:31.825
Yes, such an odd person.

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:33.501
Impossible to describe.

01:13:35.286 --> 01:13:36.959
He's--

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:38.831
he's not a person.

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:42.335
He's a shadow.

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:45.638
Oh. You know him?

01:13:56.807 --> 01:13:58.559
I have my period.

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:04.152
How odd.

01:14:05.316 --> 01:14:07.660
Just yesterday,
I told my anatomy class

01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:09.325
that married women
have their periods

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:11.656
as often as
three times a week.

01:14:13.491 --> 01:14:16.290
When can we move
into our own house?

01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:20.465
- Not yet.
- When?

01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:25.716
Not until your mother dies.

01:14:27.004 --> 01:14:28.722
I married a weakling.

01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:37.561
Would you have been better off
with Florentino Ariza?

01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:00.376
You don't see him...

01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:03.257
but I do.

01:15:07.044 --> 01:15:08.967
How joyless I am now.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.434
Would I have been
happier with him?

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:17.688
Poor man.

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:33.413
Ah, I am Dr. Juvenal Urbino.

01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:35.114
I would like
to see Don Leo.

01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:40.416
He is having his siesta.
Please, wait.

01:15:40.411 --> 01:15:42.664
Should be awake
in five minutes.

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:45.424
And you are?

01:15:47.918 --> 01:15:50.592
His nephew and chief clerk,
Florentino Ariza.

01:16:03.976 --> 01:16:05.819
Still asleep.

01:16:07.021 --> 01:16:08.819
Please.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.454
Would you like a coffee?

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.458
Do you like music?

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:25.456
I like the music
of Carlos Gardel.

01:16:25.539 --> 01:16:27.416
I see.
Popular music.

01:16:28.459 --> 01:16:29.961
Yes, but...

01:16:30.044 --> 01:16:32.172
we must keep performing
the best music in our city.

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:34.302
We must import
the greatest artists

01:16:34.381 --> 01:16:35.928
from Europe.

01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:37.180
Hmm.

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:38.806
I am working on it.

01:16:38.803 --> 01:16:40.305
And of course
the Poetic Festival.

01:16:40.387 --> 01:16:43.891
That was my idea.
I-- I started it some years ago.

01:16:43.974 --> 01:16:46.068
Yes, I know, I know.

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:48.487
Ah, well, I hope
you will attend.

01:16:48.479 --> 01:16:51.323
I mean to.
I may even enter a poem.

01:16:51.398 --> 01:16:54.527
Really?
How amusing.

01:16:56.487 --> 01:16:58.080
Of course,
one needs to...

01:16:58.155 --> 01:16:59.828
raise money
for these things.

01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:01.792
That is why I am
here to see your uncle.

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:04.625
Hmm. Hmm.

01:17:04.703 --> 01:17:07.456
My wife
supports me in this.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.005
I will say more.

01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:13.338
My wife is the very
soul of my endeavors.

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:17.634
Without her
I-- I would be nothing.

01:17:18.676 --> 01:17:20.428
I adore my wife.

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:27.352
Thank God he's awake now.

01:17:38.404 --> 01:17:40.077
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:17:40.156 --> 01:17:41.829
damas y caballeros,

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:44.376
I welcome you
to the Poetic Festival.

01:17:44.368 --> 01:17:46.041
As in years past,

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.667
this year's
Golden Orchid will be

01:17:47.746 --> 01:17:50.124
presented by
none other than...

01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:51.709
my wife.

01:18:03.762 --> 01:18:05.560
Just in time.

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:13.906
And the winner of this year's
Golden Orchid is...

01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:24.958
Wing Wu Peng.

01:18:26.076 --> 01:18:27.328
What?!

01:18:29.914 --> 01:18:32.042
It's a scandal!

01:18:35.294 --> 01:18:37.012
What was the name?

01:18:37.087 --> 01:18:39.556
It sounded Chinese.
It's impossible.

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:41.475
- Read his poem.
- Yes.

01:18:46.263 --> 01:18:49.016
- “Your body is a holy garden...”
- Believe me,

01:18:49.099 --> 01:18:50.817
my heart goes out to you.

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:52.440
I know you must
have entered a poem

01:18:52.436 --> 01:18:54.438
because of how the flower
trembled in your lapel.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:57.111
That's why I took mine off.

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:01.995
“Your body is
a holy garden...”

01:19:06.617 --> 01:19:08.665
Would you like me
to see you home?

01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:12.169
Go, horse, go.

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:14.467
I'm sorry to have
been so silent, but...

01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:16.460
I'm still very angry.

01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:18.796
I understand.

01:19:18.879 --> 01:19:21.257
But we should at least
tell each other our names.

01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:25.102
I am Florentino Ariza.

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:28.063
Sara Noriega.

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:39.324
Thank you.
Good health.

01:19:49.076 --> 01:19:50.669
Would you like
to see my albums?

01:19:52.204 --> 01:19:54.002
- Your what?
- Albums--

01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:56.092
photographs
of public events.

01:19:57.167 --> 01:19:58.760
I'm a teacher
of civics, you see.

01:19:58.836 --> 01:20:00.804
Really? Of course
I would like to--

01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:02.506
to see them.

01:20:04.258 --> 01:20:05.931
What is it?

01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:07.478
May I sit beside you...

01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:10.523
- and cry?
- Of course.

01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:13.483
Of course.

01:20:17.855 --> 01:20:19.857
Hmm.

01:20:19.857 --> 01:20:21.530
L'm so...

01:20:21.608 --> 01:20:23.451
disappointed.

01:20:23.527 --> 01:20:25.529
I can't stop.

01:20:25.529 --> 01:20:27.372
Maybe you should
loosen your bodice.

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:29.082
It will help you
to feel more...

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:31.252
comfortable, you know?

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:41.466
May I help?

01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:35.607
Tomorrow we do it in bed.

01:21:44.608 --> 01:21:47.157
You are quite wonderful.

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.787
Tell me, how would
you define love?

01:21:52.783 --> 01:21:54.785
- Love?
- Mm-hmm.

01:21:54.868 --> 01:21:56.996
Love is--

01:21:57.079 --> 01:22:00.128
love is everything
we do naked.

01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:02.593
Spiritual love
from the waist up,

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:04.966
physical love
from the waist down.

01:22:05.045 --> 01:22:07.139
Mm-hmm, yes,

01:22:07.214 --> 01:22:08.887
divided love.

01:22:08.966 --> 01:22:10.593
That could be a poem--

01:22:10.676 --> 01:22:12.269
“Divided Love.”

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:13.846
Yes, it could be.

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:15.476
Let's write it together,

01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:17.058
a poem on divided love.

01:22:17.141 --> 01:22:20.020
We can enter it in
next year's Poetic Festival.

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:21.979
We'd be certain to win.

01:22:22.062 --> 01:22:23.939
- Tell me, tell me!
- Yeah.

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:25.524
That's a good idea.

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:32.035
Divided love!

01:22:36.994 --> 01:22:39.338
Calm down! Calm down!

01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:44.509
Stop it, calm down, horse!

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:47.004
- Miss?
- Calm down.

01:22:48.839 --> 01:22:50.466
Miss?

01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:53.302
Please, allow me
to give you a lift.

01:22:54.344 --> 01:22:56.267
Please.

01:22:59.057 --> 01:23:00.684
Thank you.

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:07.483
Hey! Hey!

01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:11.571
By the way,
I am Florentino Ariza.

01:23:13.197 --> 01:23:15.120
Olimpia Zuleta.

01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:20.750
Am I taking you
out of your way?

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:22.547
Not at all.
Not at all.

01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:26.757
I would have been in terrible trouble if
I had lost my parasol.

01:23:28.045 --> 01:23:30.673
- Why so?
- My husband gave it to me.

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:32.804
Oh.

01:23:32.883 --> 01:23:34.351
Married long?

01:23:34.426 --> 01:23:35.973
Just over a year.

01:23:36.053 --> 01:23:37.851
Just a bride.

01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:40.274
He's a very jealous man,
my husband.

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:44.732
What does he do?

01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:46.480
He sells trinkets
in the market.

01:23:46.563 --> 01:23:48.440
- Oh.
- And pigeons.

01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:57.203
Excuse me, sir?
We're here.

01:23:57.282 --> 01:23:59.284
Yes, sefiora.
Ho, ho!

01:24:08.085 --> 01:24:09.758
How do I thank you?

01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:12.764
You could
sell me a pigeon.

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:15.930
They're not for sale.

01:24:16.009 --> 01:24:18.103
Then what must
I do to get one?

01:24:20.264 --> 01:24:23.939
Well, you find
her in a storm.

01:24:23.934 --> 01:24:25.902
You drive her
back to the coop.

01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:40.621
This is how I say thank you.

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:51.970
Go away!
Leave me alone!

01:24:51.962 --> 01:24:54.556
Go away! Go away!

01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:56.053
I don't know who are you!

01:24:56.133 --> 01:24:57.726
- I don't know!
- Help me!

01:24:57.801 --> 01:25:00.270
Who am I?
Who am I?

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:08.195
And whose son
are you?

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:10.568
- I'm yours.
- Whose son are you?

01:25:20.324 --> 01:25:23.168
- Wake up. Look after her!
- Ay! I fell asleep.

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:24.665
Where am I now?

01:25:24.745 --> 01:25:26.588
Uh, Rosy--
Rosy Martinez.

01:25:26.663 --> 01:25:29.291
- Oh.
- Who is this Rosy Martinez?

01:25:29.374 --> 01:25:32.173
From a children's
story long ago--

01:25:32.169 --> 01:25:33.762
Give her the breakfast.

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:40.844
Oh!

01:25:45.349 --> 01:25:46.896
At last you are here.

01:25:48.268 --> 01:25:50.862
Oh! Where have you been?

01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:53.740
You're never
coming to see me.

01:25:55.734 --> 01:25:59.364
Oh, you little boy!
Such a wonderful boy!

01:25:59.363 --> 01:26:02.492
And his name is--

01:26:02.574 --> 01:26:05.293
his name--

01:26:05.369 --> 01:26:07.997
Go on! Go! Go!

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.583
Go back to your whores!

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:12.509
You took advantage!

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.981
The only disease
you ever had was cholera.

01:26:26.056 --> 01:26:28.605
No, Mama. You confused
cholera with love.

01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:34.731
Mm-hmm.

01:26:42.447 --> 01:26:44.245
Didn't you like
the nice gentleman?

01:26:48.078 --> 01:26:50.251
Huh?

01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:54.881
I must see you again.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.133
And for only one reason.

01:26:58.255 --> 01:27:00.303
Not such a nice gentleman.

01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:19.363
- Sefior Ariza?
- Yes.

01:27:19.443 --> 01:27:21.787
The pigeon lady
sends you this

01:27:21.778 --> 01:27:24.031
and says please
keep the cage locked.

01:27:24.114 --> 01:27:27.835
Um, if it flies again,
she will not send it back.

01:27:38.712 --> 01:27:41.090
In many ways it was sinful.

01:27:41.173 --> 01:27:42.595
And I am a saint.

01:27:42.674 --> 01:27:45.268
Because you see, Ricardo,
I persisted.

01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:48.392
I broke down her defenses
and stormed the citadel.

01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:52.601
Olimpia Zuleta never refused
the meetings I arranged.

01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:56.439
But then, I got
tangled in my own net.

01:27:57.606 --> 01:27:59.153
I thought it
would be the same

01:27:59.149 --> 01:28:00.651
as it was with the others.

01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:02.782
Just another
escape route from Fermina.

01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:06.202
But then, I found myself
falling for her.

01:28:07.365 --> 01:28:09.208
And I became
a lover in pursuit.

01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:13.580
I hunted her.

01:28:13.663 --> 01:28:16.132
I was the lover who
never showed his face.

01:28:34.893 --> 01:28:37.271
I will never be able
to smell turpentine again...

01:28:39.397 --> 01:28:41.240
without thinking of this

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:43.410
blessed afternoon.

01:28:55.789 --> 01:28:57.883
No, wait, wait.

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.467
What?

01:29:06.716 --> 01:29:09.185
What are you doing?

01:29:09.261 --> 01:29:10.888
You will see.

01:30:09.279 --> 01:30:11.122
No!

01:30:12.866 --> 01:30:14.994
No!
No!

01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:26.838
He told the police
why he did it.

01:30:26.922 --> 01:30:30.051
Doesn't mention you.

01:30:43.146 --> 01:30:48.118
P There's no more life,
there's not P

01:30:48.193 --> 01:30:51.072
P There's no more rain,
there's not P

01:30:51.154 --> 01:30:52.997
P There's no more breeze,
there's not... <i>P</i>

01:30:52.989 --> 01:30:55.617
The sky is crying for Olimpia.

01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:56.917
And so am I.

01:30:56.993 --> 01:30:58.916
I' There's no more crying,
there's not I'

01:30:58.995 --> 01:31:01.464
P There's no more fear,
there's not... <i>P</i>

01:31:01.539 --> 01:31:05.669
What have I done?
What have I done?

01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:08.138
I' Take me there P

01:31:08.213 --> 01:31:11.183
I' To where you are P

01:31:11.257 --> 01:31:14.386
I' Take me there P

01:31:16.513 --> 01:31:19.232
I' Take me there P

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:22.026
I' To where you are P

01:31:22.018 --> 01:31:24.612
I' Take me there. I'

01:31:28.066 --> 01:31:31.991
What's the-- what's she going to the
market for at this time of the night?

01:31:35.365 --> 01:31:37.834
So whose son am I, Mama?

01:31:41.579 --> 01:31:43.877
Eh, whose son am I?

01:32:05.478 --> 01:32:08.652
I hoped your mother would
have liked my singing.

01:32:08.732 --> 01:32:11.235
I know she would.
I know.

01:32:11.234 --> 01:32:13.077
The only regret
I have in dying

01:32:13.153 --> 01:32:15.497
is that I can't sing
at my own funeral.

01:32:46.352 --> 01:32:48.400
Good people!

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.942
Good people.

01:32:51.941 --> 01:32:53.943
Fellow citizens,

01:32:53.943 --> 01:32:57.868
we are gathered here at
the dawn of a new century.

01:33:03.745 --> 01:33:07.170
The 20th century
will see the end

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:09.216
of man's suffering.

01:33:09.292 --> 01:33:11.090
The 20th century

01:33:11.169 --> 01:33:14.469
will bring
us harmony, peace,

01:33:14.464 --> 01:33:17.559
and it will bring us light!

01:33:29.187 --> 01:33:31.736
“374...

01:33:31.815 --> 01:33:34.819
Peruvian spinster, Luisa--

01:33:34.901 --> 01:33:36.653
Sunday school teacher.”

01:33:44.494 --> 01:33:46.622
My destiny in life

01:33:46.704 --> 01:33:48.331
is to love Fermina.

01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:51.259
Sefior?

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:53.882
Sefion

01:33:53.962 --> 01:33:56.181
Over there please.

01:33:56.172 --> 01:33:58.345
Come on, come on!

01:34:01.052 --> 01:34:02.975
Mm-hmm.

01:34:03.054 --> 01:34:05.022
Mmm.

01:34:05.014 --> 01:34:06.732
Try it.

01:34:06.808 --> 01:34:09.687
Tell me
what you think.

01:34:18.903 --> 01:34:21.907
Delicious.
Absolutely delicious.

01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:23.913
What is it?

01:34:23.992 --> 01:34:25.460
Eggplant.

01:34:27.996 --> 01:34:29.919
More, please.

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:32.251
Perhaps, as an act
of remembrance,

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:35.553
we should name
our next child

01:34:35.628 --> 01:34:38.131
Eggplant Urbino.

01:34:40.091 --> 01:34:42.219
I love you

01:34:42.218 --> 01:34:44.061
above all else.

01:34:44.053 --> 01:34:46.806
More than anyone else
in the world.

01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:49.814
The important thing in marriage
is not happiness

01:34:49.893 --> 01:34:52.362
but stability.

01:34:54.063 --> 01:34:56.816
And love.

01:34:58.484 --> 01:35:01.328
Nothing is
more difficult than love.

01:35:11.497 --> 01:35:15.092
Sefiora, buy my parakeets.
Look, they're very pretty.

01:35:39.025 --> 01:35:41.403
Sefior Ariza,

01:35:41.486 --> 01:35:44.865
we wanted
to thank you.

01:35:44.948 --> 01:35:46.325
Sorry?

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:48.330
You wrote letters
for us.

01:35:50.286 --> 01:35:53.210
Ah, yes.
I remember, yes.

01:35:53.289 --> 01:35:55.667
It was the only time
I wrote letters for--

01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:58.299
for both lovers.
It was like writing to myself.

01:36:00.255 --> 01:36:01.848
We're married now.

01:36:02.966 --> 01:36:04.468
Good.

01:36:04.467 --> 01:36:07.562
We wanted to ask you,
will you be godfather?

01:36:08.554 --> 01:36:10.477
Yes, of course.

01:36:10.556 --> 01:36:12.479
He's our first son.

01:36:12.558 --> 01:36:15.027
Yes, I will be honored.

01:36:43.006 --> 01:36:46.351
<i>L'll</i> be damned.
You screw just like your father.

01:36:46.426 --> 01:36:48.428
Well, I just dropped in
to tell you

01:36:48.511 --> 01:36:50.434
I've decided to retire

01:36:50.513 --> 01:36:53.016
and I'm appointing you
president of the company.

01:36:53.016 --> 01:36:55.860
And you, sefiorita,
please feel free to continue.

01:36:55.852 --> 01:36:58.947
I swear on my word of honor that I have
not seen your face.

01:36:59.022 --> 01:37:01.024
So, please.

01:37:24.547 --> 01:37:26.265
Shh!

01:37:28.718 --> 01:37:30.641
Shh.
Stop it.

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.893
You'll wake Fermina.
It's Sunday.

01:38:02.752 --> 01:38:05.676
It's Sunday today.
You've-- you've missed mass.

01:38:09.258 --> 01:38:10.931
You haven't taken
your communion

01:38:11.010 --> 01:38:12.512
for at least
three weeks.

01:38:12.595 --> 01:38:14.472
Have you lost
your faith?

01:38:25.441 --> 01:38:28.445
- Doctor.
- Yes.

01:38:28.444 --> 01:38:30.446
Look at me.

01:38:31.656 --> 01:38:34.125
What?
What is it?

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:38.538
Her smell
is in my nostrils.

01:38:42.166 --> 01:38:44.635
I have the right

01:38:44.710 --> 01:38:47.680
to know who she is.

01:38:53.636 --> 01:38:57.857
Her name is
Barbara Lynch.

01:39:02.562 --> 01:39:04.656
How long has it been
going on?

01:39:04.730 --> 01:39:08.075
Three months,

01:39:08.151 --> 01:39:10.074
nearly four.

01:39:10.153 --> 01:39:13.327
- Where did you meet her?
- She's a patient.

01:39:13.406 --> 01:39:16.000
What is--

01:39:16.075 --> 01:39:18.578
what is she,
this-- this patient?

01:39:18.661 --> 01:39:21.039
A doctor of theology,

01:39:21.122 --> 01:39:23.090
a Protestant.

01:39:23.166 --> 01:39:26.841
She has a mission
by the harbor.

01:39:28.087 --> 01:39:30.840
I thought

01:39:30.923 --> 01:39:34.018
at least you--

01:39:34.093 --> 01:39:37.939
you'd be a man

01:39:38.014 --> 01:39:39.937
and deny
the whole thing.

01:39:40.016 --> 01:39:41.939
I thought
at least you'd--

01:39:42.018 --> 01:39:45.238
you'd lie to me.

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:58.246
I f-- I feel

01:39:58.326 --> 01:40:00.704
asthough
a great weight

01:40:00.786 --> 01:40:02.629
has lifted
from my shoulders.

01:40:02.705 --> 01:40:05.003
L-- I will put
an end to it.

01:40:06.626 --> 01:40:08.219
And I'll go
to my confessor

01:40:08.294 --> 01:40:11.218
and ask
for absolution.

01:40:20.056 --> 01:40:22.229
Come on, let's go,
it's going to rain.

01:41:27.164 --> 01:41:29.087
I have been waking

01:41:29.166 --> 01:41:31.464
in the early hours
of the morning

01:41:31.544 --> 01:41:35.344
and then unable
to go back to sleep.

01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:38.972
And I have

01:41:39.051 --> 01:41:42.646
sudden stabbing pains
in my chest.

01:41:42.722 --> 01:41:45.817
Worst of all,
in the afternoons I--

01:41:45.891 --> 01:41:48.144
I simply want to weep

01:41:48.227 --> 01:41:50.901
uncontrollably.

01:41:52.648 --> 01:41:54.400
I think
I am going to die.

01:41:54.483 --> 01:41:57.783
That would be best.

01:41:57.862 --> 01:42:00.411
Then we could both
have some peace.

01:42:32.188 --> 01:42:34.065
Bedtime, kids.
Go.

01:42:34.148 --> 01:42:36.025
We're going to eat our
dinner, Aunt Fermina.

01:42:36.108 --> 01:42:37.530
Thank you. Thank you.

01:42:40.196 --> 01:42:42.494
Do you still
recognize me--

01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:46.703
the fat old thing
that I have become?

01:43:08.182 --> 01:43:10.105
It's been over a year

01:43:10.184 --> 01:43:12.107
and not a whisper,
not a hint.

01:43:12.186 --> 01:43:14.655
Nobody knows
where she is.

01:43:14.730 --> 01:43:16.698
I have made
myself believe

01:43:16.774 --> 01:43:18.697
that if she were dead

01:43:18.776 --> 01:43:20.699
I would have heard.

01:43:20.778 --> 01:43:22.872
All I can do
to keep myself sane

01:43:22.947 --> 01:43:25.575
is to follow
my routine:

01:43:25.658 --> 01:43:27.877
472, Maria Florida--

01:43:27.952 --> 01:43:29.875
sells flowers
in the market.

01:43:31.747 --> 01:43:33.499
499, Josephine
Triola--

01:43:33.582 --> 01:43:35.926
I-I don't exactly know
who she was.

01:43:35.918 --> 01:43:39.013
533, Galetia Fernandez--

01:43:39.088 --> 01:43:42.058
nothing memorable
to report.

01:43:42.133 --> 01:43:44.761
Routine is
like rust.

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:13.373
I could stay here
forever.

01:44:13.456 --> 01:44:15.754
You should have come
soonen

01:44:15.833 --> 01:44:18.177
You did
the right thing--

01:44:18.252 --> 01:44:20.675
teach him a lesson.

01:44:22.381 --> 01:44:24.133
And what happened
to the man

01:44:24.133 --> 01:44:26.135
who sent you
all those telegrams?

01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:29.893
Oh, he's very
grand now.

01:44:29.972 --> 01:44:32.600
President of the River Company
of the Caribbean.

01:44:32.683 --> 01:44:35.903
Hmm.
Do you still see him?

01:44:35.978 --> 01:44:37.901
Of course not.

01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:41.359
And anyway...

01:44:41.442 --> 01:44:44.036
he's not a man.
He's a ghost.

01:44:44.111 --> 01:44:47.331
It was all
an illusion.

01:44:47.406 --> 01:44:49.784
And you,
Hildebranda,

01:44:49.867 --> 01:44:52.040
what happened
to your married man?

01:44:55.289 --> 01:44:57.291
He stayed married.

01:45:08.344 --> 01:45:10.722
- Three days!
- Less than that.

01:45:10.805 --> 01:45:13.354
Can I take care
of your horse?

01:45:13.349 --> 01:45:15.477
Uh-huh.

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:28.285
It is better
to arrive in time than--

01:45:28.364 --> 01:45:30.537
than to be
invited, no?

01:45:34.453 --> 01:45:36.706
- Hildebranda.
- Juvenal.

01:45:36.789 --> 01:45:39.417
- Are your boots still killing you?
- Thank you, God.

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:41.343
How good you are.

01:45:42.336 --> 01:45:44.509
I must get the children
ready for supper.

01:45:47.758 --> 01:45:51.228
- Come on, kids.
- <i>l'll</i> go first.

01:45:51.303 --> 01:45:53.226
- No, <i>l'll</i> go first.
- <i>l'll</i> go first.

01:45:53.305 --> 01:45:55.433
<i>L'll</i> go first.

01:45:57.518 --> 01:46:00.192
What are you
doing here?

01:46:00.271 --> 01:46:02.990
Well, I know
you would be too proud

01:46:03.065 --> 01:46:05.864
to return on your own,
so I have--

01:46:05.943 --> 01:46:08.913
I have come
to fetch you.

01:46:10.781 --> 01:46:12.454
L-- I thought

01:46:12.533 --> 01:46:15.503
we might have
a second honeymoon.

01:46:33.178 --> 01:46:35.772
But the following night,
while the old man slept...

01:46:42.813 --> 01:46:45.783
- Oh, dear God, now what?
- Shh, please.

01:46:45.858 --> 01:46:47.485
Shh, Fermina.

01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:00.006
Thank you, God.
Thank you.

01:47:19.934 --> 01:47:21.936
Excuse me.

01:47:25.814 --> 01:47:28.533
It's been a long time
since I've seen her.

01:47:28.609 --> 01:47:30.156
Good evening.

01:47:30.235 --> 01:47:33.830
And she has changed,
Ricardo.

01:47:33.906 --> 01:47:36.455
But, what was worst,

01:47:36.533 --> 01:47:39.787
is that her husband
seemed younger than ever.

01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:42.373
And I had this...

01:47:42.456 --> 01:47:44.800
terrible thought that
she would die first.

01:47:44.875 --> 01:47:46.548
Heaven forbid.

01:47:46.627 --> 01:47:49.597
Heaven forbid.
And it made me realize

01:47:49.672 --> 01:47:52.721
that I have grown
older too.

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:54.723
Those stairs...

01:47:54.802 --> 01:47:57.772
up and down those stairs
will kill me.

01:47:59.598 --> 01:48:03.102
Uh, I'm not afraid of death,
I'm afraid of old age.

01:48:03.185 --> 01:48:05.483
So...

01:48:05.562 --> 01:48:09.408
I doubt I will be
coming here so often.

01:48:13.028 --> 01:48:17.283
Why are you so
successful with women?

01:48:17.366 --> 01:48:20.210
Um...

01:48:20.202 --> 01:48:23.581
because they
see in me someone...

01:48:23.664 --> 01:48:24.836
guilty.

01:48:24.915 --> 01:48:28.715
In need of love.
Someone who will not...

01:48:28.711 --> 01:48:31.134
harm them.

01:48:34.425 --> 01:48:37.053
My heart has more rooms
than a whore house, Ricardo.

01:48:38.887 --> 01:48:41.356
What number are
you on now?

01:48:41.432 --> 01:48:44.151
Prepare yourself
for a shock.

01:48:44.226 --> 01:48:47.070
I'm on number 622.

01:48:47.146 --> 01:48:49.569
Impossible.

01:48:49.648 --> 01:48:53.198
I speak the truth--
622.

01:48:57.656 --> 01:48:59.374
Some time ago--

01:48:59.450 --> 01:49:01.373
I forget exactly when--

01:49:01.452 --> 01:49:04.046
Uncle Leo asked me to
keep an eye on the daughter

01:49:04.121 --> 01:49:08.171
of some distant relation
of ours from Puerto Padre.

01:49:08.250 --> 01:49:10.878
She was being sent
here to college

01:49:10.961 --> 01:49:13.055
to become a teacher.

01:49:13.130 --> 01:49:16.851
And then,
little by little,

01:49:16.925 --> 01:49:19.599
I won her confidence
and affection.

01:49:19.678 --> 01:49:24.559
And in due course, the doors
of heaven opened to her.

01:49:24.641 --> 01:49:27.269
Her name is America Vicufia.

01:49:27.352 --> 01:49:29.855
We see each other
on Sundays.

01:49:29.938 --> 01:49:34.318
We are quite open about our,
what shall I say?

01:49:34.401 --> 01:49:35.869
Friendship.

01:49:35.944 --> 01:49:38.242
For one thing,
the difference in our ages

01:49:38.322 --> 01:49:40.791
places us above suspicion.

01:49:41.992 --> 01:49:44.461
Someone has died.

01:49:44.536 --> 01:49:46.129
Huh-uh.

01:49:46.205 --> 01:49:49.129
It's Pentecost.

01:49:49.124 --> 01:49:52.549
No.
No, it must be a--

01:49:52.628 --> 01:49:56.053
a very big fish if they are ringing
the cathedral bells.

01:49:56.131 --> 01:49:57.257
Mmm.

01:50:03.472 --> 01:50:06.100
America.

01:50:06.183 --> 01:50:08.652
You must go back
to college.

01:50:08.727 --> 01:50:13.324
My driver will take you.
There is something I have to do.

01:50:37.673 --> 01:50:39.516
Fermina...

01:50:39.508 --> 01:50:42.933
I have waited for this
opportunity for 51 years,

01:50:43.011 --> 01:50:45.639
nine months and four days.

01:50:45.722 --> 01:50:48.896
That is...

01:50:48.976 --> 01:50:52.480
how long I have loved you
from the first moment I cast eyes on you

01:50:52.563 --> 01:50:54.236
un-- until now.

01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:57.693
Florentino Ariza...

01:50:59.069 --> 01:51:01.743
get out of here!

01:51:02.739 --> 01:51:05.242
Get out!

01:51:08.370 --> 01:51:09.917
“Florentino Ariza,

01:51:09.997 --> 01:51:13.547
you are a dreadful,
insensitive human being.

01:51:13.542 --> 01:51:15.920
How dare you
enter my house

01:51:16.003 --> 01:51:18.051
on the day my beloved
husband died

01:51:18.046 --> 01:51:21.892
and utter such monstrous,
ridiculous sentiments?

01:51:21.884 --> 01:51:24.262
You have put me in
a mortal rage,

01:51:24.344 --> 01:51:26.767
which has caused me
to think about you without wanting to.

01:51:26.847 --> 01:51:28.815
Do you understand?

01:51:28.891 --> 01:51:32.145
I do not want to think about you.
stay out of my life.”

01:51:36.690 --> 01:51:38.192
Go, donkey, go!

01:51:42.321 --> 01:51:46.042
Hi, dear.
Let's not waste time.

01:51:46.116 --> 01:51:47.743
I don't want to
see a movie.

01:51:47.826 --> 01:51:50.045
Do you know what
I want to do?

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:53.499
Before you go home,
I have something to tell you.

01:51:53.582 --> 01:51:57.007
Pull over.
Pull over, please.

01:52:03.717 --> 01:52:06.266
I'm going to get married.

01:52:10.682 --> 01:52:13.902
It's a lie.
Old men don't get married.

01:52:20.192 --> 01:52:22.286
Who is she?

01:52:22.361 --> 01:52:25.615
- Do you want to cry?
- No!

01:52:27.157 --> 01:52:29.125
I don't know
who she is.

01:52:29.201 --> 01:52:32.580
But whoever she is,
she has ruined my life.

01:52:32.663 --> 01:52:33.960
America, you must...

01:52:33.956 --> 01:52:35.629
I don't want to hear it,
Florentino.

01:52:35.707 --> 01:52:38.381
L'm warning you.

01:52:48.387 --> 01:52:52.358
“Please allow me to wipe
the slate clean.

01:52:53.809 --> 01:52:58.565
Age has no reality
except in the physical world.

01:52:59.564 --> 01:53:01.282
The essence of
a human being

01:53:01.358 --> 01:53:03.986
is resistant to
the passage of time.

01:53:06.488 --> 01:53:09.332
Our inner lives
are eternal,

01:53:09.324 --> 01:53:13.830
which is to say that our spirits remain
as youthful and vigorous

01:53:13.829 --> 01:53:17.504
as when we were
in full bloom.

01:53:17.499 --> 01:53:20.799
Think of love
as a state of grace--

01:53:20.877 --> 01:53:23.346
not the means
to anything,

01:53:23.422 --> 01:53:26.596
but the alpha
and omega.

01:53:26.675 --> 01:53:29.053
An end in itself.

01:53:33.265 --> 01:53:35.859
Think of love as
a state of grace--

01:53:35.934 --> 01:53:38.528
not the means to
anything,

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:41.399
but the alpha
and omega.

01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:44.155
An end in itself.”

01:53:54.619 --> 01:53:57.714
The messenger is
waiting for a reply.

01:54:05.714 --> 01:54:08.718
Mother, what is it?

01:54:10.844 --> 01:54:13.063
Someone wants to
call on me.

01:54:13.055 --> 01:54:15.057
Who?

01:54:15.057 --> 01:54:17.480
Don Florentino Ariza.

01:54:17.559 --> 01:54:20.233
The man who owns
the riverboats?

01:54:20.228 --> 01:54:22.777
You know what they say
about him?

01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:25.487
No.

01:54:25.567 --> 01:54:27.661
They say he has
never had a woman.

01:54:27.736 --> 01:54:30.114
In fact, they say

01:54:30.197 --> 01:54:33.622
his tastes are
quite the opposite.

01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:36.044
They say he
has a secret office

01:54:36.119 --> 01:54:39.840
where he takes boys he picks up on
the docks at night.

01:54:41.917 --> 01:54:45.046
I simply
don't believe that.

01:54:45.128 --> 01:54:48.257
I've known him since
he was a boy.

01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:50.434
He's an honorable man.

01:55:05.690 --> 01:55:09.035
Everything in the world
has changed.

01:55:09.111 --> 01:55:11.239
I haven't.
Have you?

01:55:11.321 --> 01:55:13.198
What does it matter now?

01:55:13.281 --> 01:55:15.454
L've just turned
72.

01:55:15.450 --> 01:55:20.047
Yes, we are two old people
about to be ambushed by death.

01:55:24.334 --> 01:55:26.428
Do you believe
in God?

01:55:26.503 --> 01:55:28.255
No.

01:55:28.338 --> 01:55:30.466
But I am afraid of Him.

01:55:34.553 --> 01:55:38.808
Some of your letters
were a great comfort.

01:55:40.475 --> 01:55:43.319
I'm glad to know
you received them.

01:55:46.106 --> 01:55:50.452
What-- what I most
admired about them

01:55:50.527 --> 01:55:54.282
was their simplicity.

01:55:54.364 --> 01:55:57.413
They helped me
a great deal.

01:55:57.492 --> 01:55:59.995
In what way?

01:56:01.413 --> 01:56:03.916
They helped me

01:56:03.999 --> 01:56:07.003
regain some kind
of peace.

01:56:08.670 --> 01:56:11.014
You cannot
imagine how happy

01:56:11.089 --> 01:56:13.842
I am to know that.

01:56:13.842 --> 01:56:17.312
But I don't agree with
everything you say.

01:56:19.347 --> 01:56:23.352
We have nothing in common
except memories.

01:56:23.351 --> 01:56:27.356
The young people we
were are banished--

01:56:27.439 --> 01:56:31.034
that was all
an illusion.

01:56:33.028 --> 01:56:35.656
Not for me.

01:56:47.542 --> 01:56:49.385
Well...

01:56:49.377 --> 01:56:52.221
I thought this
might amuse you.

01:56:57.886 --> 01:57:00.560
That must be
50 years ago.

01:57:00.555 --> 01:57:03.183
At least.

01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:12.068
I have something
to say.

01:57:14.236 --> 01:57:16.330
In my experience,
when anyone says that,

01:57:16.404 --> 01:57:18.202
it's bound to
be unpleasant.

01:57:18.281 --> 01:57:21.956
These frequent visits
from the man you are seeing

01:57:22.035 --> 01:57:23.753
are unseemly.

01:57:23.828 --> 01:57:26.547
Ofelia, it's none
of your business.

01:57:26.623 --> 01:57:28.421
He is company for Mama.

01:57:28.416 --> 01:57:30.885
- He consoles her.
- Consoles her?

01:57:30.961 --> 01:57:33.805
All he needs to do to
complete his consolation

01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:36.383
is to climb into
her widow's bed.

01:57:36.466 --> 01:57:37.843
Ofelia.

01:57:37.926 --> 01:57:39.678
But don't you believe

01:57:39.761 --> 01:57:43.265
that love justifies
anything and everything?

01:57:43.265 --> 01:57:45.438
Love is ridiculous
at our age.

01:57:45.517 --> 01:57:48.942
But at theirs,
it's revolting.

01:57:50.647 --> 01:57:52.991
The only thing
that hurts me

01:57:53.066 --> 01:57:55.068
is that I don't have
enough strength

01:57:55.151 --> 01:57:56.869
to give you the beating
that you deserve

01:57:56.945 --> 01:58:00.495
for being so insolent
and evil-minded.

01:58:00.574 --> 01:58:03.293
But you will leave
this house right now

01:58:03.285 --> 01:58:05.287
and I swear to you
on my mother's grave

01:58:05.287 --> 01:58:07.790
that you will not set foot
in it again as long as I live.

01:58:07.789 --> 01:58:10.759
Ofelia, Mama,
let's not...

01:58:10.834 --> 01:58:13.883
Life crippled that
poor man 50 years ago

01:58:13.962 --> 01:58:18.433
because he was too young and now you
want to do it because we are too old.

01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:31.985
What I'd like most is
to walk out of my house

01:58:32.063 --> 01:58:34.441
and _keep going,
going, going,

01:58:34.524 --> 01:58:36.197
and never come back.

01:58:36.276 --> 01:58:38.370
Well, you--
you could take a boat.

01:58:38.445 --> 01:58:40.573
Well...

01:58:40.655 --> 01:58:42.077
I might.

01:58:42.157 --> 01:58:44.251
I might
just do that.

01:58:44.326 --> 01:58:45.999
I have one.

01:58:45.994 --> 01:58:47.917
The New Fidelity.

01:58:47.996 --> 01:58:51.250
It's--
it's leaving soon.

01:58:51.333 --> 01:58:53.256
It's eight days
up-river,

01:58:53.335 --> 01:58:56.509
and five days
on the return.

01:58:56.504 --> 01:59:00.680
Travel is good for
the troubled spirit.

01:59:02.844 --> 01:59:05.723
Splendid vision
of the Earth,

01:59:05.805 --> 01:59:08.854
passing, changing...

01:59:08.850 --> 01:59:11.478
as we travel by.

01:59:27.243 --> 01:59:30.042
Come in.

01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:35.089
Are your quarters
to your liking?

01:59:36.378 --> 01:59:39.678
It is
the Presidential Suite.

01:59:41.132 --> 01:59:44.386
It was my idea
to install it.

01:59:45.762 --> 01:59:48.891
I wanted to call it
the Honeymoon Suite.

01:59:52.727 --> 01:59:55.571
Do you want to
be alone?

01:59:55.563 --> 01:59:59.534
If I did, I wouldn't have
told you to come in.

02:00:13.123 --> 02:00:17.253
Juvenal is a good man.
ls a good husband.

02:00:17.252 --> 02:00:21.257
I can't imagine
a better one.

02:00:21.339 --> 02:00:23.967
But when I look back,

02:00:24.050 --> 02:00:27.395
I suppose there...

02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:30.940
were more difficulties
than pleasure.

02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:35.103
Too many useless
arguments.

02:00:35.103 --> 02:00:37.572
Too much anger.

02:00:37.647 --> 02:00:40.321
Maybe it's time...

02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:44.246
to ask ourselves,

02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:48.370
with our strong
desire to live,

02:00:48.450 --> 02:00:52.125
what to do with
the love that has been left behind

02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:55.090
without a master?

02:01:00.295 --> 02:01:03.799
It's incredible

02:01:03.798 --> 02:01:07.098
how one can be happy

02:01:07.177 --> 02:01:09.521
for so many years

02:01:09.596 --> 02:01:12.600
in the midst of
so many problems,

02:01:12.682 --> 02:01:15.982
so many squabbles.

02:01:15.977 --> 02:01:19.322
Damn it.

02:01:19.314 --> 02:01:24.320
And not really know
if it was love or not.

02:01:31.534 --> 02:01:33.878
Go now.

02:01:41.169 --> 02:01:44.048
Not now.

02:01:44.130 --> 02:01:47.509
I smell like
an old woman.

02:01:50.386 --> 02:01:54.061
I have never been happier
in all my life.

02:02:02.232 --> 02:02:05.076
P Oh, my love P

02:02:05.151 --> 02:02:09.702
P What wouldn't I
do for you <i>P</i>

02:02:09.697 --> 02:02:13.497
I' Just to take you
for a second <i>P</i>

02:02:13.576 --> 02:02:15.374
P Away from the world P

02:02:15.453 --> 02:02:18.127
P And close to me P

02:02:21.668 --> 02:02:24.717
P Oh, my love P

02:02:24.712 --> 02:02:27.716
I' Like the Magdalena River I'

02:02:29.467 --> 02:02:32.562
I' That it melts
into sands from the sea I'

02:02:33.763 --> 02:02:37.734
I' I want to melt into you I'

02:02:40.061 --> 02:02:42.564
I' There are love affairs P

02:02:42.647 --> 02:02:47.403
P That wait until winter
to blossom P

02:02:47.485 --> 02:02:52.207
I' And get greener
at night in the fall <i>P</i>

02:02:52.282 --> 02:02:56.412
<i>P</i> Just like this love
that I feel for you. <i>P</i>

02:03:00.957 --> 02:03:04.302
Tomorrow we reach

02:03:04.377 --> 02:03:06.880
our last port-of-call--

02:03:07.881 --> 02:03:11.761
La Dorada.

02:03:11.843 --> 02:03:13.845
And then...

02:03:13.928 --> 02:03:16.226
turn back for home.

02:04:06.481 --> 02:04:07.573
Don't look.

02:04:10.485 --> 02:04:12.453
Why not?

02:04:12.528 --> 02:04:15.202
Because you won't like it.

02:04:38.388 --> 02:04:41.892
I have waited for this moment
for 53 years.

02:04:43.267 --> 02:04:45.269
Yes. Yes, you--

02:04:45.353 --> 02:04:47.731
you've told me before.

02:04:51.693 --> 02:04:55.197
I have remained
a virgin for you.

02:04:58.408 --> 02:05:00.877
You're a liar.

02:05:56.340 --> 02:05:58.934
- Captain, Captain.
- Thank you, sir.

02:05:58.926 --> 02:06:00.473
Captain?

02:06:00.553 --> 02:06:03.682
- Um, speaking hypothetically--
- Hi, how are you?

02:06:03.765 --> 02:06:05.438
Hello.

02:06:05.433 --> 02:06:06.935
Speaking hypothetically,

02:06:06.934 --> 02:06:09.278
would it be possible
to make the...

02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:12.444
- Captain.
- ...return trip without stopping?

02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:14.568
- Thank you.
- Without cargo

02:06:14.650 --> 02:06:17.779
or passengers, without
coming into any port...

02:06:17.862 --> 02:06:18.909
Thank you.

02:06:18.988 --> 02:06:21.411
...without--
without anything?

02:06:21.491 --> 02:06:23.289
It's possible.

02:06:23.367 --> 02:06:25.415
But only hypothetically.

02:06:25.495 --> 02:06:29.341
As you know better than I,
the company has contracts to fulfill.

02:06:31.167 --> 02:06:33.090
But there is one thing
that could be done.

02:06:33.169 --> 02:06:34.796
What is that?

02:06:34.879 --> 02:06:37.052
If we had a case of
cholera onboard.

02:06:37.131 --> 02:06:38.553
Ooh.

02:06:38.633 --> 02:06:41.637
We'd hoist the yellow flag
and be quarantined.

02:06:41.636 --> 02:06:45.186
Well then, let's do that.

02:06:47.308 --> 02:06:51.814
I command this ship,
but you command me.

02:06:51.813 --> 02:06:55.067
If you're serious, just give
me the order in writing

02:06:55.149 --> 02:06:57.151
and we will leave
right now.

02:07:26.514 --> 02:07:30.189
I love you,
my crowned goddess.

02:07:31.519 --> 02:07:35.444
We're going to
stay like this.

02:07:35.523 --> 02:07:38.197
You can't mean it.

02:07:38.276 --> 02:07:40.904
From the moment
I was born,

02:07:40.987 --> 02:07:44.867
I have never said anything
I did not mean.

02:07:49.370 --> 02:07:54.126
And how long do you--
you think we can...
