03:45.799 --> 03:47.599
You Red Welby?

03:47.601 --> 03:48.867
Yes, ma'am.
How may I help you?

03:48.869 --> 03:50.969
Are you in charge
of renting

03:50.971 --> 03:52.571
the three billboards out
on Drinkwater Road?

03:52.573 --> 03:54.672
I didn't know we had
any billboards on...

03:54.674 --> 03:55.974
Where is Drinkwater Road?

03:55.976 --> 03:57.674
Past Sizemore turn-off.

03:57.676 --> 03:59.714
Nobody uses it since the
freeway got put in.

04:06.720 --> 04:07.851
You're right.

04:07.853 --> 04:09.053
We got three billboards
out there.

04:09.055 --> 04:13.158
Nobody's put nothing
up there since 1986.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.358
That was Huggies.

04:14.360 --> 04:16.896
How much to rent all three
of them out for the year?

04:17.563 --> 04:19.130
A year?

04:19.132 --> 04:21.697
On a road
that no one goes down

04:21.700 --> 04:22.934
unless they got lost
or they're retards...

04:22.936 --> 04:23.968
For a year?

04:23.970 --> 04:25.306
Quick, ain't you, Welby?

04:27.306 --> 04:28.342
Well,

04:29.576 --> 04:31.509
since what I say
goes these days

04:31.511 --> 04:33.345
down at the Ebbing
Advertising Desk...

04:33.347 --> 04:35.812
I'm gonna strike you
a real good deal.

04:35.814 --> 04:37.381
What's your name?

04:37.383 --> 04:40.985
What's the law on what you can
and cannot say on a billboard?

04:40.987 --> 04:43.388
Nothing defamatory,

04:43.390 --> 04:46.323
and you can't say "fuck",
"piss" or "cunt". That right?

04:46.325 --> 04:47.328
Uh...

04:48.729 --> 04:49.930
Or...

04:50.431 --> 04:51.696
Anus.

04:51.698 --> 04:54.400
Well, I think
I'll be all right then.

04:57.037 --> 04:59.004
Here's 5,000
for the first month.

04:59.006 --> 05:00.306
I assume that'll cover it.

05:01.275 --> 05:03.607
And here's what
they are to say.

05:03.609 --> 05:04.842
Why don't you
write up a contract

05:04.844 --> 05:06.278
betwixt us
while you're at it.

05:06.280 --> 05:08.520
Make sure nobody rents them
billboards out from under me.

05:13.052 --> 05:15.186
I guess you're
Angela Hayes's mother.

05:15.188 --> 05:18.359
That's right.
I'm Angela Hayes's mother.

05:24.898 --> 05:26.199
Name's Mildred.

05:28.068 --> 05:30.201
How long before
you get them put up?

05:31.503 --> 05:33.474
Shall we say by...

05:34.208 --> 05:35.975
Easter Sunday?

05:37.044 --> 05:38.378
That would be perfect.

05:42.181 --> 05:46.384
<i>♪ As I was walking
down the streets of Laredo ♪</i>

05:48.054 --> 05:53.225
<i>♪ As I walked down
to Laredo one day ♪</i>

05:54.727 --> 05:58.595
<i>♪ I spied a young cowboy

05:58.597 --> 06:03.535
<i>♪ All wrapped in white linen

06:21.087 --> 06:22.821
Hey, what the hell
is this?

06:22.823 --> 06:24.090
<i>Que?</i>

06:25.191 --> 06:26.958
"How come,
Chief Willoughby" what?

06:26.960 --> 06:28.559
- What?
- Yeah.

06:28.561 --> 06:29.627
Huh?

06:29.629 --> 06:30.694
"How come" what?

06:30.696 --> 06:32.530
- What, what?
- What?

06:32.532 --> 06:33.932
Listen,
you fucking beaner,

06:33.934 --> 06:36.001
I'd better start getting
some straight answers.

06:36.003 --> 06:37.304
Put that down.

07:06.633 --> 07:08.232
What the hell is this?

07:08.234 --> 07:10.901
Hey, you.
What the fuck is this?

07:10.903 --> 07:12.304
What the fuck
is what?

07:12.306 --> 07:14.341
This! This.

07:17.777 --> 07:19.343
Advertising, I guess.

07:19.345 --> 07:20.480
Advertising what?

07:27.854 --> 07:29.223
Something obscure?

07:29.989 --> 07:32.857
I'll say. Yeah.

07:32.859 --> 07:34.627
Don't I know your face
from some place?

07:35.729 --> 07:37.127
I don't know, do you?

07:37.129 --> 07:39.499
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

07:42.936 --> 07:44.901
I could arrest you
right now...

07:44.903 --> 07:46.037
For what?

07:46.039 --> 07:47.237
For emptying your bucket.

07:47.239 --> 07:50.908
That's being bad against
the environment laws.

07:50.910 --> 07:55.547
Well, before you do that,
Officer Dixon,

07:55.549 --> 07:56.915
how about
you have a look

07:56.917 --> 07:58.915
at that first billboard
over there?

07:58.917 --> 08:00.852
And then we can have
ourself a conversation

08:00.854 --> 08:03.521
about the motherfucking
environment.

08:03.523 --> 08:05.359
How about that?

08:23.710 --> 08:25.576
Fuck me.

08:28.414 --> 08:30.150
Don't, William.

08:34.086 --> 08:36.120
Dixon, you goddamn asshole.

08:36.121 --> 08:39.159
I'm in the middle
of my goddamn Easter dinner.

08:39.692 --> 08:41.092
Sorry, kids.

08:41.094 --> 08:42.491
I know, Chief,

08:42.494 --> 08:45.063
and I'm sorry for calling
you at home and all, but...

08:45.065 --> 08:47.734
I think we got kind of a problem.

10:08.215 --> 10:09.749
No, no. Go back.

10:34.374 --> 10:36.442
Sorry I'm late, Denise.

10:37.474 --> 10:38.910
Did you put up
those billboards yet?

10:38.912 --> 10:39.944
They're up.

10:39.946 --> 10:44.247
Go, girl. You go
fuck those cops up.

10:44.249 --> 10:46.918
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, Welby?

10:46.920 --> 10:49.654
You didn't think there would
be legal ramifications?

10:49.656 --> 10:51.322
What's the legal
ramifications, Cedric?

10:51.324 --> 10:53.492
Do you want
me to explain?

10:53.494 --> 10:55.794
Little punk like you.
And don't call me Cedric!

10:55.796 --> 10:59.663
Ain't contravening no laws
on any fucking thing.

10:59.665 --> 11:00.531
I checked.

11:00.533 --> 11:02.565
And where did you check
all this out?

11:02.567 --> 11:03.834
In a...

11:03.836 --> 11:04.969
A book.

11:04.971 --> 11:06.304
Which book, genius?

11:06.306 --> 11:08.876
Book called <i>Suck My Ass,
It's None Of Your Business.</i>

11:12.812 --> 11:15.313
Fuck.

11:15.315 --> 11:18.116
How long has this person,
or persons,

11:18.118 --> 11:20.117
rented these
billboards out for?

11:20.119 --> 11:22.655
Oh, the year.

11:23.657 --> 11:25.792
How long has she
actually paid for?

11:26.725 --> 11:28.125
The year.

11:28.127 --> 11:30.397
So it's a "she", is it?

11:32.132 --> 11:33.899
I ain't at liberty
to divulge

11:33.901 --> 11:35.702
that kind of information,
Chief.

11:37.070 --> 11:40.174
Mildred Hayes, perhaps?

11:41.007 --> 11:42.140
Ain't at liberty
to divulge

11:42.142 --> 11:43.841
that kind of information,
Chief.

11:43.843 --> 11:44.742
Do you really wanna fuck

11:44.744 --> 11:46.977
with the Ebbing
Police Department, Red?

11:46.979 --> 11:48.282
Do you?

11:49.749 --> 11:51.181
I guess.

11:51.183 --> 11:53.284
He said what?
To your face?

11:53.286 --> 11:54.685
No crime has been
committed here.

11:54.687 --> 11:57.021
Defamation of character
ain't a crime?

11:57.023 --> 11:59.857
Not if she's simply
asking a question.

11:59.859 --> 12:00.891
What are you, an idiot?

12:00.893 --> 12:02.425
Don't call me
an idiot, Dixon!

12:02.427 --> 12:03.661
I didn't
call you an idiot,

12:03.663 --> 12:05.463
I asked if you was an idiot.
That was a question.

12:05.465 --> 12:06.865
He got you there, Cedric.

12:06.867 --> 12:08.232
That's it.

12:08.234 --> 12:10.035
Don't fly off the handle.

12:10.037 --> 12:11.435
Why in the hell
you keep that man on?

12:11.437 --> 12:12.636
He's a good man at heart.

12:12.638 --> 12:14.804
He tortured a guy
in custody, Bill.

12:14.806 --> 12:18.378
There was no real evidence
to support that.

12:20.279 --> 12:22.713
Take them down.

12:22.715 --> 12:23.848
Take that shit down.

12:23.850 --> 12:24.915
What shit?

12:24.917 --> 12:27.919
Hey, boy. Think I wouldn't
take you out right here

12:27.921 --> 12:28.920
on Main Street, Red?

12:28.922 --> 12:31.856
Thought you only took out
black dudes, Dixon.

12:31.858 --> 12:34.190
No! No! Stop it.

12:34.192 --> 12:36.929
You ever fucking touch me,
motherfucker...

12:38.598 --> 12:39.764
You drunk?

12:39.766 --> 12:41.935
- Are you drunk right now?
- Get up.

12:44.604 --> 12:47.304
Nobody ever goes
down that road anyways.

12:47.306 --> 12:51.107
Unless they got lost.
Or they're retards.

12:51.109 --> 12:52.843
Don't be nervous,
is the main thing.

12:52.845 --> 12:54.478
It will go just fine.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.146
Don't look into the
camera, obviously.

12:56.148 --> 12:57.618
Let's hold
for this car.

12:59.952 --> 13:02.185
In three, two, one.

13:02.187 --> 13:04.822
So, Mildred Hayes, why did
you put up these billboards?

13:04.824 --> 13:06.623
<i>My daughter, Angela,</i>

13:06.625 --> 13:08.425
<i>was abducted,
raped and murdered</i>

13:08.427 --> 13:09.526
<i>seven months ago</i>

13:09.528 --> 13:11.228
<i>along this selfsame
stretch of road.</i>

13:11.230 --> 13:13.497
What you watching,
Momma? Stupid news?

13:13.499 --> 13:15.400
<i>Seems to me
the local police department</i>

13:15.402 --> 13:17.568
<i>is too busy
torturing black folks</i>

13:17.570 --> 13:21.039
<i>to be bothered doing anything
about solving actual crime.</i>

13:21.041 --> 13:22.240
<i>I thought these billboards</i>

13:22.242 --> 13:24.775
<i>might concentrate
their minds some.</i>

13:24.777 --> 13:26.376
Fuck.

13:26.378 --> 13:28.378
<i>I don't know
what the police are doing.</i>

13:28.380 --> 13:29.713
<i>I do know that my...</i>

13:29.715 --> 13:33.383
...daughter's burnt body
is lying six feet underground.

13:33.385 --> 13:35.251
They're eating
Krispy Kremes

13:35.253 --> 13:36.386
<i>and busting eight-year-olds</i>

13:36.388 --> 13:38.289
<i>for skating
around parking lots.</i>

13:38.291 --> 13:39.924
<i>And Chief Willoughby,</i>

13:39.926 --> 13:41.157
<i>why single him out?</i>

13:41.159 --> 13:42.525
<i>He's the head of them.</i>

13:42.527 --> 13:44.228
<i>Buck's gotta stop somewhere.</i>

13:44.230 --> 13:45.429
<i>And the buck
stops at Willoughby?</i>

13:45.431 --> 13:47.799
<i>Yeah.
Dead right it does.</i>

14:03.483 --> 14:05.018
You all right
there, fella?

14:07.420 --> 14:10.056
Looks like we got a war
on our hands.

14:33.812 --> 14:34.914
Can we talk?

14:41.120 --> 14:42.987
I'd do anything
to catch the guy

14:42.989 --> 14:44.122
who did it,
Mrs. Hayes.

14:44.124 --> 14:45.622
But when the DNA
don't match

14:45.624 --> 14:47.558
no one who's ever
been arrested,

14:47.560 --> 14:51.362
and when the DNA don't match
any other crime nationwide,

14:51.364 --> 14:53.863
and when there wasn't
a single eyewitness

14:53.865 --> 14:55.532
from the time
she'd left your house

14:55.534 --> 14:57.002
to the time we found her,

14:58.071 --> 15:01.104
right now there ain't
too much more we can do.

15:01.106 --> 15:04.342
Could pull blood from every
man and boy in this town

15:04.344 --> 15:07.144
over the age of eight.

15:07.146 --> 15:10.548
There's civil rights laws
prevents that, Mrs. Hayes.

15:10.550 --> 15:12.516
What if he was just
passing through town?

15:12.518 --> 15:14.352
Every man
in the country, then.

15:14.354 --> 15:16.621
What if he was just passing
through the country?

15:16.623 --> 15:19.589
If it was me,
I'd start up a database.

15:19.591 --> 15:22.359
Every male baby what's
born, stick them on it,

15:22.361 --> 15:24.562
and as soon as he done
something wrong,

15:24.564 --> 15:25.728
cross-reference it,

15:25.730 --> 15:28.500
make 100% certain
it was a correct match,

15:28.502 --> 15:29.835
then kill him.

15:31.771 --> 15:35.473
Yeah, well, there's
definitely civil rights laws

15:35.475 --> 15:36.777
prevents that.

15:40.080 --> 15:44.082
I'm doing everything I can
to track him down.

15:44.084 --> 15:47.450
I don't think those
billboards is very fair.

15:47.452 --> 15:49.453
The time it took you
to get out here

15:49.455 --> 15:50.687
whining like a bitch,
Willoughby,

15:50.689 --> 15:52.088
some other poor girl's
probably

15:52.090 --> 15:53.089
being butchered
right now.

15:53.091 --> 15:54.458
But I'm glad you got
your priorities straight,

15:54.460 --> 15:55.961
I'll say that for you.

16:04.336 --> 16:06.672
There's something else,
Mildred.

16:11.277 --> 16:12.646
I got cancer.

16:14.180 --> 16:15.413
I'm dying.

16:15.415 --> 16:16.716
I know it.

16:19.351 --> 16:20.550
Huh?

16:20.552 --> 16:23.123
I know it. Most everybody
in town knows it.

16:28.427 --> 16:30.627
And you still put up
those billboards?

16:30.629 --> 16:32.163
Well, they wouldn't be
as effective

16:32.165 --> 16:34.167
after you croak.
Right?

17:15.406 --> 17:17.307
Well, looky looky.

17:17.309 --> 17:18.576
If it ain't
the instigator

17:18.578 --> 17:20.778
of this whole goddamn affair
in the first place.

17:20.780 --> 17:22.913
I didn't
instigate shit, Dixon.

17:22.915 --> 17:25.415
Playing pool
against the town midget.

17:25.416 --> 17:26.584
He's right, Red,

17:26.586 --> 17:28.618
you are playing pool
against the town midget.

17:28.620 --> 17:30.754
He's a cop,
he's observant.

17:30.756 --> 17:32.790
I always disliked you,

17:32.792 --> 17:35.091
ever since you was
a snotty little child.

17:35.093 --> 17:37.895
You still look like
a snotty little child.

17:37.897 --> 17:40.731
That's unfortunate. I always
thought you was great.

17:40.733 --> 17:46.236
Even your name, Red Welby.
Even your name I disliked.

17:46.238 --> 17:48.772
Well, okay.

17:48.774 --> 17:52.676
Like you was some kind of
goddamn communist

17:52.678 --> 17:53.845
and proud of it.

17:53.847 --> 17:57.815
No, it's because
I got red hair.

17:57.817 --> 17:59.215
You know what they do
to faggots

17:59.217 --> 18:00.553
down in Cuba, Welby?

18:01.186 --> 18:02.353
Wow, that's left field.

18:02.355 --> 18:05.325
No, what do they do to
faggots down in Cuba, Dixon?

18:06.091 --> 18:07.290
They kill them.

18:07.292 --> 18:11.296
Which, it might surprise you
to learn, I'm against.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.696
I'm not sure if they do
kill faggots

18:12.698 --> 18:13.998
down in Cuba, Dixon.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.299
I know Cuba's human rights
record's pretty deplorable

18:16.301 --> 18:18.569
when it comes to
homosexuality,

18:18.571 --> 18:20.870
but killing them?

18:20.872 --> 18:23.707
Are you sure you ain't
thinking of Wyoming?

18:23.709 --> 18:26.876
Always gotta be
the smart-ass, Jesus.

18:26.878 --> 18:28.581
He's quite good,
isn't he?

18:32.752 --> 18:36.119
Hey, Willoughby's a good man.
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

18:36.121 --> 18:38.289
I'm talking nice
to you now, aren't I?

18:38.291 --> 18:39.792
I'm talking nice to you.

18:40.459 --> 18:41.992
He's a good man.

18:41.994 --> 18:44.661
Shouldn't have this be the
only thing he thinks about,

18:44.663 --> 18:46.299
last months left to him.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.202
Last months what?

18:53.505 --> 18:55.172
Oh...

18:55.174 --> 18:57.241
You didn't know?

18:57.243 --> 18:59.076
Yeah, pancreatic.

18:59.078 --> 19:02.546
I'm up next. You old
ladies quit yakking.

19:02.548 --> 19:03.646
Rude.

19:03.648 --> 19:04.882
Hey, Mildred.

19:04.884 --> 19:07.518
I saw you on TV
the other day.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.953
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, you looked good.

19:09.955 --> 19:13.156
I mean, you know,
you came across really good

19:13.158 --> 19:15.059
in the things
that you were saying.

19:15.061 --> 19:17.226
I didn't think you
came across real good.

19:17.228 --> 19:20.764
I thought you came across
as a stupid-ass.

19:20.766 --> 19:21.866
Ain't it about time
you got home

19:21.868 --> 19:23.701
to your momma, Dixon?

19:23.703 --> 19:26.904
No, it ain't time
I go home to my momma.

19:26.906 --> 19:31.075
I told her I was gonna be out
till 12:00, actually.

19:31.077 --> 19:32.145
Jesus.

19:37.684 --> 19:41.551
That's me versus you,
Mildred. Uh-huh.

19:41.553 --> 19:43.553
Hey, Robbie.
I think that midget

19:43.555 --> 19:45.722
wants to get in my pants.

19:45.724 --> 19:48.026
Father Montgomery.

19:48.028 --> 19:52.163
Mildred. I'm sorry to be
calling on you so late,

19:52.165 --> 19:53.396
but, uh...

19:53.398 --> 19:57.401
I must say, Robbie has
been the consummate host.

19:57.403 --> 20:01.172
Despite his having had,
as he was just telling me

20:01.174 --> 20:03.206
somewhat of a tricky day
at school.

20:03.208 --> 20:06.242
Just some of the guys
on the team giving me crap.

20:06.244 --> 20:07.543
Crap about what?

20:07.545 --> 20:10.180
About the billboards,
Mildred.

20:10.182 --> 20:12.649
Which is what I've come to
have a word with you about.

20:12.651 --> 20:15.019
Oh. Proceed.

20:15.021 --> 20:17.887
I know how hard it's
been for you, Mildred,

20:17.889 --> 20:19.790
this past year.
We all do.

20:19.792 --> 20:22.960
And if there is ever
anything that you need,

20:22.962 --> 20:24.594
we will be there for you.

20:24.596 --> 20:25.932
Always.

20:26.532 --> 20:28.232
But the town also knows

20:28.234 --> 20:31.271
what kind of a man
William Willoughby is.

20:32.338 --> 20:33.703
And the town is dead set

20:33.705 --> 20:36.706
against these billboards
of yours.

20:36.708 --> 20:37.942
Took a poll,
did you, Father?

20:37.944 --> 20:41.212
If you hadn't stopped
coming to church,

20:41.214 --> 20:44.482
you'd have a little bit
more understanding

20:44.484 --> 20:46.416
of the depth
of people's feelings.

20:46.418 --> 20:50.320
More than a dozen people
came to me on Sunday.

20:50.322 --> 20:52.425
So, yes, I took a poll.

20:53.559 --> 20:57.163
Everybody is with you
about Angela.

20:57.963 --> 21:00.166
Nobody is with you
about this.

21:05.838 --> 21:08.705
You know what I was
thinking about today?

21:08.707 --> 21:10.441
I was thinking
about those street gangs

21:10.443 --> 21:11.841
they have
down in Los Angeles,

21:11.843 --> 21:14.778
those Crips
and those Bloods.

21:14.780 --> 21:16.480
And I was thinking about
that bunch of new laws

21:16.482 --> 21:17.647
they came up with

21:17.649 --> 21:19.617
in the 1980s,
I think it was,

21:19.619 --> 21:24.088
to combat those street gangs,
those Crips and those Bloods.

21:24.090 --> 21:25.388
And, if I remember rightly,

21:25.390 --> 21:28.526
the gist of what those
new laws were saying was,

21:28.528 --> 21:30.161
if you join
one of these gangs,

21:30.163 --> 21:32.863
and you're running
with them,

21:32.865 --> 21:35.232
and down the block one night,
unbeknownst to you,

21:35.234 --> 21:37.768
one of your fellow Crips,
or your fellow Bloods,

21:37.770 --> 21:40.570
shoot up a place,
or stab a guy...

21:40.572 --> 21:42.639
Well then, even though

21:42.641 --> 21:44.241
you may not know
nothing about it

21:44.243 --> 21:47.845
and you were just standing
on a street corner

21:47.847 --> 21:49.847
minding your own business,

21:49.849 --> 21:54.452
what these new laws said
was you're still culpable.

21:54.454 --> 21:56.819
You're still culpable
by the very act of having

21:56.821 --> 21:58.255
joined those Crips
and those Bloods

21:58.257 --> 22:00.257
in the first place.

22:00.259 --> 22:02.592
Which got me thinking,
Father,

22:02.594 --> 22:04.127
that whole
type of situation

22:04.129 --> 22:07.464
is kinda like you
church boys, ain't it?

22:07.466 --> 22:10.934
You got your colors,
you got your clubhouse.

22:10.936 --> 22:14.437
You're, for want
of a better word, a gang.

22:14.439 --> 22:15.905
And if you were upstairs

22:15.907 --> 22:17.907
smoking a pipe
and reading your Bible

22:17.909 --> 22:19.809
while one of your fellow
gang members

22:19.811 --> 22:22.713
is downstairs fucking
an altar boy, well...

22:22.715 --> 22:26.216
Father, just like those Crips,
and just like those Bloods,

22:26.218 --> 22:27.684
you're culpable.

22:27.686 --> 22:30.753
Because you joined
the gang, man.

22:30.755 --> 22:32.321
I don't care
if you never did shit,

22:32.323 --> 22:34.992
you never saw shit,
you never heard shit,

22:34.994 --> 22:39.195
you join the gang,
you're culpable.

22:39.197 --> 22:42.399
And when a person is culpable
to altar-boy-fucking,

22:42.401 --> 22:43.567
or any kinda boy-fucking,

22:43.569 --> 22:47.570
because I know you guys didn't
really narrow that down,

22:47.572 --> 22:50.007
then you kinda forfeit the
right to come into my house

22:50.009 --> 22:51.876
and say anything about me

22:51.878 --> 22:55.281
or my life, or my daughter,
or my billboards.

22:58.517 --> 23:01.184
So why don't you just finish
up your tea there, Father,

23:01.186 --> 23:03.255
and get the fuck
outta my kitchen.

23:14.065 --> 23:16.268
But thanks for coming up
anyway, Father.

23:21.072 --> 23:22.472
How you been
feeling, Bill?

23:24.009 --> 23:28.011
Ah, like I got cancer
in a major organ.

23:28.013 --> 23:31.147
Well, I just want you to know
we're all on your side

23:31.149 --> 23:33.250
about this
Mildred Hayes thing.

23:33.252 --> 23:37.190
If I have to hear that
one more fucking time...

23:39.125 --> 23:43.196
I'm done with this shit.
I can't waste my life waiting.

23:45.732 --> 23:47.364
Stop reading
fucking comic books

23:47.366 --> 23:49.899
and get me the file
on the Hayes case.

23:49.901 --> 23:52.735
Angela Hayes case
or the Mildred Hayes case?

23:52.737 --> 23:54.871
There is no
Mildred Hayes case.

23:54.873 --> 23:56.405
We've had
two official complaints

23:56.407 --> 23:58.341
about those billboards,
so, actually...

23:58.343 --> 23:59.344
From who?

24:03.115 --> 24:05.585
There's a lady
with a funny eye

24:06.351 --> 24:08.086
and a fat dentist.

24:09.087 --> 24:13.156
Get me the file
on the Angela Hayes case.

24:13.158 --> 24:16.726
"Lady with
a funny fucking eye"?

24:16.728 --> 24:18.130
Jesus Christ.

24:31.609 --> 24:32.678
Late night?

24:35.613 --> 24:37.146
No.

24:37.148 --> 24:39.185
Lay off that Welby guy,
will you?

24:40.519 --> 24:42.351
Or you'll do what?

24:42.353 --> 24:44.620
Kick your momma's
fucking teeth in.

24:44.622 --> 24:45.991
No, you won't.

24:48.461 --> 24:51.127
Who told you I was laying on him anyway?
The midget?

24:51.129 --> 24:53.931
What the fuck
are you talking about?

24:53.933 --> 24:55.898
And I'm trying
to fucking concentrate.

24:55.900 --> 24:57.269
Fucking midgets!

25:22.061 --> 25:23.663
What you looking for
anyway?

25:26.165 --> 25:28.234
There's nothing
to look for.

25:30.836 --> 25:33.503
I don't know what it is.

25:33.505 --> 25:35.571
It feels like
it's kinda waggling.

25:35.573 --> 25:38.677
Well, if it's waggling,
it's gonna have to come out.

25:41.880 --> 25:44.016
Ain't you gonna
take a look at it first?

25:45.684 --> 25:47.286
It's gonna have to come out.

25:51.090 --> 25:54.494
Can I get a little
Novocaine there, doc?

26:10.909 --> 26:12.445
Give it a couple
of minutes.

26:27.892 --> 26:30.161
There's a lot
of good friends

26:30.163 --> 26:31.861
of Bill Willoughby
in this town.

26:31.863 --> 26:33.931
No! Ow! Stop! No!

26:36.534 --> 26:38.271
God damn it!

26:44.743 --> 26:46.710
Then why don't you tell
those good friends

26:46.712 --> 26:47.778
of Bill Willoughby

26:47.780 --> 26:50.583
to tell him to go do his
fucking job, fat boy.

27:05.097 --> 27:07.097
Hey, Mildred.

27:07.099 --> 27:08.799
You didn't happen
to pay a visit

27:08.801 --> 27:10.166
to the dentist today,
did you?

27:10.168 --> 27:11.902
- No.
- Huh?

27:11.904 --> 27:13.302
I said "no".

27:13.304 --> 27:16.705
So it wasn't you
who drilled a little hole

27:16.707 --> 27:21.077
in one of big fat Geoffrey's
big fat thumbnails, no?

27:21.079 --> 27:23.046
- Of course not.
- Huh?

27:23.048 --> 27:24.947
I said "of course not".

27:24.949 --> 27:27.084
You drilled a hole
in the dentist?

27:27.086 --> 27:28.385
Denise, no, I didn't.

27:28.387 --> 27:30.319
I thought it was
kinda funny myself,

27:30.321 --> 27:32.856
but he wants
to press charges,

27:32.858 --> 27:35.861
so we're gonna have to
bring you in, I'm afraid.

27:57.116 --> 27:58.248
So how's it all going

27:58.250 --> 28:00.416
in the nigger-torturing
business, Dixon?

28:00.418 --> 28:04.186
It's persons-of-color-torturing
business, these days.

28:04.188 --> 28:07.560
If you wanna know,
I didn't torture nobody.

28:09.294 --> 28:10.394
What's the matter
with you,

28:10.396 --> 28:13.195
saying that
goddamn stuff on TV?

28:13.197 --> 28:15.130
My momma watches
that station.

28:15.132 --> 28:16.665
She doesn't know
about the torturing?

28:16.667 --> 28:19.336
No. She's against
that kinda thing.

28:19.338 --> 28:20.537
Who's against what?

28:20.539 --> 28:23.339
My momma is against
persons-of-color-torturing.

28:23.341 --> 28:24.808
She said
"nigger-torturing".

28:24.810 --> 28:26.842
I said, "You can't say
'nigger-torturing' no more.

28:26.844 --> 28:29.412
"You gotta say
persons-of-color-torturing."

28:29.414 --> 28:30.750
Isn't that right, Chief?

28:31.282 --> 28:32.651
Ain't that right?

28:35.353 --> 28:39.188
I think I'll be able to
take care of Mrs. Hayes

28:39.190 --> 28:41.626
on my own
from here on, Jason.

28:46.698 --> 28:48.833
Sure, Chief.
I'll be right outside.

29:00.846 --> 29:02.846
Don't give me that look.

29:02.848 --> 29:06.849
If you got rid of every cop
with vaguely racist leanings,

29:06.851 --> 29:08.918
you'd have three cops left,

29:08.920 --> 29:11.320
and all of them are gonna
hate the fags.

29:11.322 --> 29:13.790
So what are you gonna do,
you know?

29:15.994 --> 29:18.094
I wanna know something,
Mildred.

29:18.096 --> 29:19.663
Why did you drill a hole

29:19.665 --> 29:22.732
through poor fat
Geoffrey's thumbnail?

29:22.734 --> 29:24.733
That did not happen.

29:24.735 --> 29:26.203
His hand slipped.

29:26.205 --> 29:28.806
He drilled a hole
through his own self.

29:28.808 --> 29:30.206
Did he say I did it?

29:30.208 --> 29:32.008
I guess it's his word

29:32.010 --> 29:34.011
against mine, then, huh?

29:34.013 --> 29:36.812
Kinda like in all those
rape cases you hear about.

29:36.814 --> 29:39.782
Except, this time,
the chick ain't losing.

29:39.784 --> 29:42.019
It ain't really about winning
or losing, though,

29:42.021 --> 29:44.154
is it, Mildred?

29:44.156 --> 29:47.257
You think I care about
who wins or loses

29:47.259 --> 29:48.992
between the two of youse?

29:48.994 --> 29:51.261
You think
I care about dentists?

29:51.263 --> 29:53.230
I don't care about
dentists.

29:53.232 --> 29:55.434
Nobody cares
about dentists.

29:56.368 --> 29:59.472
What I do care about,
or what I'm

30:00.237 --> 30:02.673
interested in

30:02.675 --> 30:05.776
is tying you up
in court so long

30:05.778 --> 30:08.043
that your hours
at the gift shop

30:08.045 --> 30:10.380
be so shot to shit

30:10.382 --> 30:12.281
that you ain't gonna
have a penny

30:12.283 --> 30:14.820
to pay for another
month's billboards.

30:15.654 --> 30:18.186
That's what
I'm interested in.

30:18.188 --> 30:19.822
I got some dough
put away.

30:19.824 --> 30:22.125
But what I heard was
you had to sell off

30:22.127 --> 30:23.559
your ex-husband's
tractor-trailer

30:23.561 --> 30:27.032
to even pay for this month's
billboards, that right?

30:28.167 --> 30:30.733
How is old Charlie,
by the way?

30:30.735 --> 30:34.069
He still shacked up with
that pretty little intern

30:34.071 --> 30:35.271
works down at the zoo?

30:35.273 --> 30:38.008
Still shacked up with some
chick smells of shit.

30:38.010 --> 30:40.176
I don't know if the zoo's
got anything to do with it.

30:40.178 --> 30:42.044
Although I'd hope so.

30:44.581 --> 30:47.216
How old is she?
Nineteen?

30:47.218 --> 30:49.452
That must smart.

30:49.454 --> 30:52.821
Keep trying.
Keep trying.

30:52.823 --> 30:56.026
What's Charlie think about
these billboards of yours,

30:56.028 --> 30:57.894
an ex-cop like Charlie?

30:57.896 --> 30:59.163
Ex-cop, ex-wife-beater.

30:59.165 --> 31:00.463
Same difference,
I guess, right?

31:00.465 --> 31:03.436
His word against yours,
though, right?

31:05.170 --> 31:07.570
Charlie don't know
about them, does he?

31:07.572 --> 31:09.172
It's none of his business.

31:09.174 --> 31:10.907
He's kinda paying
for them, though.

31:10.909 --> 31:12.242
I'm paying for them!

31:12.244 --> 31:13.376
This month you are.

31:13.378 --> 31:15.648
How about when...

31:20.918 --> 31:22.050
I didn't mean to...

31:22.052 --> 31:23.185
I know.

31:23.187 --> 31:24.319
It was an accident.

31:24.321 --> 31:25.590
I know, baby.

31:26.225 --> 31:27.659
It's blood.

31:30.227 --> 31:33.062
I'm gonna go
get somebody.

31:33.064 --> 31:34.966
Hey!

31:36.068 --> 31:37.267
Just let her go.

31:37.269 --> 31:38.501
Come on, Chief.

31:38.503 --> 31:40.539
Just let her go!

31:44.542 --> 31:46.411
Easy, easy, easy.

31:50.349 --> 31:51.583
Hey...

32:13.105 --> 32:14.404
Do birds get cancer?

32:14.406 --> 32:15.973
Huh?

32:15.975 --> 32:18.074
Birds. Do they get cancer?

32:18.076 --> 32:20.443
I don't know. Dogs do.

32:20.445 --> 32:23.581
Yeah, well, I wasn't talking
about dogs, was I?

32:29.588 --> 32:33.290
Great, the good old "Raped
While Dying" ride home.

32:33.292 --> 32:34.957
If there was two seconds
in a day

32:34.959 --> 32:38.094
when I wasn't thinking
about how she died...

32:38.096 --> 32:41.164
"Think about it some more,
why don't you?"

32:41.166 --> 32:43.465
As much as
a person might have

32:43.467 --> 32:46.403
tried to avoid the details
of what happened

32:46.405 --> 32:48.271
because he didn't think
it would do any good,

32:48.273 --> 32:50.240
and he couldn't
bear it,

32:50.242 --> 32:53.976
it's also good to be informed
in 20-foot-high font

32:53.978 --> 32:57.813
the precise details
of her last moments.

32:57.815 --> 33:00.684
That it wasn't enough
that she was raped

33:00.686 --> 33:03.552
and it wasn't enough
that she died, no.

33:03.554 --> 33:06.455
"Raped While Dying."

33:06.457 --> 33:07.892
Thank you, Mom.

33:09.561 --> 33:11.895
I gave you
the police reports.

33:11.897 --> 33:13.963
I didn't read them.

33:13.965 --> 33:17.235
I'm depressed enough
as it fucking is.

33:57.509 --> 33:59.209
<i>Mom?</i>

33:59.211 --> 34:00.376
<i>Yeah?</i>

34:00.378 --> 34:02.478
<i>You ain't going out
again tonight, are you?</i>

34:02.480 --> 34:04.681
Denise and I are gonna
grab a couple of beers.

34:04.683 --> 34:05.982
Denise gonna be
driving you?

34:05.984 --> 34:08.650
Why don't you just
ask to borrow the car?

34:08.652 --> 34:11.054
- Can I borrow the car?
- No.

34:11.056 --> 34:12.021
Bitch!

34:12.023 --> 34:13.790
I will give you money
for a taxi

34:13.792 --> 34:15.657
if you ask nice
and don't call me a bitch.

34:15.659 --> 34:17.960
Why make me ask if you
weren't gonna let me?

34:17.962 --> 34:18.929
It was funny.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.529
And because you've been
smoking pot all day.

34:20.531 --> 34:22.632
- You are such a hypocrite.
- Hypocrite?

34:22.634 --> 34:24.366
- Yeah.
- How?

34:24.368 --> 34:26.402
Drove drunk
when we were kids.

34:26.404 --> 34:28.003
What are you
talking about?

34:28.005 --> 34:29.371
Daddy told me.

34:29.373 --> 34:30.639
When did you see him?

34:30.641 --> 34:32.041
Don't change the subject.

34:32.043 --> 34:35.378
Did you drive drunk with us
in the car when we were kids?

34:35.380 --> 34:36.579
Once, maybe.

34:36.581 --> 34:37.947
Okay, once?

34:37.949 --> 34:39.514
When he was in the middle
of beating the shit out of me.

34:39.516 --> 34:41.183
Which we've only
got your word about!

34:41.185 --> 34:42.719
Angela, for Christ sakes.

34:42.721 --> 34:44.721
Why are you
never on my side?

34:44.723 --> 34:46.456
I'm always on your side when
you're not being a cunt!

34:46.458 --> 34:47.623
Hey!

34:47.625 --> 34:49.458
There will be no more
"cunts" in this house.

34:49.460 --> 34:50.728
Are you moving out?

34:51.295 --> 34:52.998
It was a gag.

34:54.699 --> 34:56.933
Are you gonna let me
borrow the car or what?

34:56.935 --> 34:59.668
Why don't you
just walk, Angela?

34:59.670 --> 35:02.672
You know what?
I will walk.

35:02.674 --> 35:06.675
And you know what else?
I hope I get raped on the way!

35:06.677 --> 35:08.947
I hope you do too!

35:23.594 --> 35:25.962
<i>Gonna need to keep you
in a few days, Bill.</i>

35:25.964 --> 35:28.331
<i>You shouldn't be
coughing up blood.</i>

35:28.333 --> 35:31.701
Yeah, I kinda
guessed that, Doc.

35:31.703 --> 35:33.902
I'll swing by
in the morning.

35:33.904 --> 35:34.973
Anne.

35:39.511 --> 35:42.378
I guess I'll go
get your coat, huh?

35:42.380 --> 35:44.313
Well, you know
I ain't staying.

35:44.315 --> 35:45.916
You know
I ain't arguing.

36:39.003 --> 36:40.105
Oops.

36:46.712 --> 36:48.112
You old cunt.

36:49.313 --> 36:50.746
I'm not old, Robbie.

36:51.850 --> 36:53.317
That's Dad.

36:56.520 --> 36:58.454
Hey, Dad.
How's it going?

36:58.456 --> 36:59.825
Where's the crazy lady?

37:06.864 --> 37:09.398
Kid has got Rice fucking
Krispies in his fucking hair.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.366
What's going on?

37:10.368 --> 37:12.835
What's going on with these
fucking billboards?

37:12.837 --> 37:14.538
Kinda self-explanatory.

37:14.540 --> 37:17.206
Why don't you
explain it to me?

37:17.208 --> 37:20.675
Guess it ain't
self-explanatory, then.

37:20.677 --> 37:23.579
I wanted certain
people's minds

37:23.581 --> 37:25.815
kept on certain
people's jobs, is all.

37:25.817 --> 37:28.083
Hadn't heard from them
in seven goddamn months.

37:28.085 --> 37:30.686
I've heard an awful lot
from them

37:30.688 --> 37:32.154
since I put them
billboards up.

37:32.156 --> 37:34.657
You think this has
focused their minds? Mmm?

37:34.659 --> 37:38.126
It's focused their minds
on how exactly

37:38.128 --> 37:39.395
are they gonna
fuck you up.

37:39.397 --> 37:41.396
The more you keep a case
in the public eye,

37:41.398 --> 37:44.032
the better your chances
are of getting it solved.

37:44.034 --> 37:45.967
It's in
all the guidebooks.

37:45.969 --> 37:47.969
How much
these billboards cost?

37:47.971 --> 37:49.572
About the same
as a tractor-trailer.

37:50.708 --> 37:52.041
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

37:52.043 --> 37:52.909
Nothing.

37:52.911 --> 37:54.009
Laughed at by a guy

37:54.011 --> 37:55.712
with fucking cereal
in his hair.

37:55.714 --> 37:57.313
How's Penelope?

37:57.315 --> 37:58.715
Huh? She's all right.

37:58.717 --> 38:00.148
Why don't you
invite her in?

38:00.150 --> 38:01.784
Save leaving her
sitting out there.

38:01.786 --> 38:03.920
- She here?
- She's out in the car.

38:03.922 --> 38:05.456
That explains it.

38:06.757 --> 38:07.989
That explains what?

38:07.991 --> 38:09.327
I know
I smelt something.

38:12.362 --> 38:13.630
Let her go!

38:13.632 --> 38:16.733
Oh! Um, I kinda need
to use the bathroom,

38:16.735 --> 38:17.900
but if it's inconvenient...

38:17.902 --> 38:20.136
Actually, it is
inconvenient, isn't it?

38:20.138 --> 38:21.471
I can hold it.
It's all right.

38:21.473 --> 38:22.871
It's the first door
down the hall.

38:22.873 --> 38:25.340
Sure? I feel like
I'm intruding.

38:25.342 --> 38:26.643
Just go pee.

38:26.645 --> 38:27.880
Oh.

38:45.763 --> 38:47.963
Look, you said
what you came to say.

38:47.965 --> 38:49.498
So why don't you go
get zoo girl

38:49.500 --> 38:51.500
and get the hell out of
my house, all right?

38:51.502 --> 38:54.637
Um, actually, zoo-wise,
they were letting people go

38:54.639 --> 38:55.804
at the zoo,
unfortunately,

38:55.806 --> 38:58.174
and it was a case of
"last in, first out". So...

38:58.176 --> 39:00.777
Unfortunately the zoo
had to let me go.

39:00.779 --> 39:01.911
But they were looking
for people

39:01.913 --> 39:05.047
down at the horse rides
for the disableds.

39:05.049 --> 39:06.849
So I'm working
down there now,

39:06.851 --> 39:09.221
looking after
the disableds' horses.

39:17.761 --> 39:19.395
Don't say a word.

39:19.397 --> 39:21.132
I wasn't gonna say a word.

39:23.601 --> 39:27.038
You don't think I don't wish
it had never happened?

39:30.375 --> 39:32.842
You don't think I don't wish
she was still here?

39:32.844 --> 39:34.880
I know you do.

39:36.281 --> 39:38.016
I know you do.

39:39.817 --> 39:43.386
Billboards ain't gonna
bring her back, Mildred.

39:43.388 --> 39:46.558
Neither is fucking
19-year-olds, Charlie.

39:48.326 --> 39:49.427
Yeah?

39:50.295 --> 39:52.063
But I know that.

39:53.764 --> 39:55.434
Just go.

39:56.567 --> 39:58.302
Yeah, all right.

39:59.036 --> 40:00.369
I'm such a shitty dad

40:00.371 --> 40:02.273
and you're such a great mom.
All right.

40:03.407 --> 40:06.442
So how come a week
before she died

40:06.444 --> 40:09.579
she's asking if she can move
in with me at my place?

40:09.581 --> 40:11.114
Couldn't stand you bitching

40:11.116 --> 40:12.982
and fighting
with each other no more.

40:12.984 --> 40:14.016
I don't believe you.

40:14.018 --> 40:18.121
I said, "Stay,
your mom loves you."

40:18.123 --> 40:22.257
Now I wish I hadn't.
She'd still fucking be here.

40:22.259 --> 40:23.659
I don't believe you!

40:23.661 --> 40:25.364
Don't believe me.

40:25.996 --> 40:28.065
Ask Froot Loop boy.

40:38.409 --> 40:39.478
Is that true?

40:41.511 --> 40:43.247
I don't know, Mom.

40:46.351 --> 40:48.119
Yeah, you do.

40:55.025 --> 40:56.358
<i>What's the matter?</i>

40:56.360 --> 40:57.626
<i>Nothing.</i>

40:57.628 --> 41:01.063
Oh, come on,
not Donald Sutherland again.

41:01.065 --> 41:03.766
What is this, frickin'
Donald Sutherland season?

41:03.768 --> 41:05.934
I like him.
I like his hair.

41:05.936 --> 41:07.272
Hair?

41:08.639 --> 41:10.840
This is the one
where his little girl dies.

41:10.842 --> 41:13.942
Always a plus in a movie.

41:13.944 --> 41:15.911
Talking of dead kids,

41:15.913 --> 41:18.181
what's happening
with the billboard lady?

41:18.183 --> 41:21.250
Oh, that kooz
won't listen to reason.

41:21.252 --> 41:23.251
She's tough as an old boot.

41:23.253 --> 41:24.454
Oh...

41:24.456 --> 41:26.054
Why don't you just
fuck her over

41:26.056 --> 41:27.558
through her friends then?

41:29.259 --> 41:30.192
Huh?

41:30.194 --> 41:32.795
You know, why don't you
fuck her friends over?

41:32.797 --> 41:35.230
Bring her around
that way.

41:35.232 --> 41:38.169
She got any friends
you can fuck over?

41:50.882 --> 41:52.684
Rat bastards.

42:02.661 --> 42:03.893
Hey, fuckhead!

42:03.895 --> 42:04.960
What?

42:04.962 --> 42:06.395
Don't say "what", Dixon,

42:06.397 --> 42:08.730
when she comes in
calling you a fuckhead.

42:08.732 --> 42:10.632
- And don't you...
- Shut up!

42:10.634 --> 42:12.835
You, get over here.

42:12.837 --> 42:16.337
No! You, get over here.

42:16.339 --> 42:17.440
All right.

42:17.442 --> 42:19.275
What? Dixon!

42:19.277 --> 42:21.444
You do not allow a member
of the public

42:21.446 --> 42:23.311
to call you a fuckhead
in the station house!

42:23.313 --> 42:25.614
I'm taking care of it
in my own way.

42:25.616 --> 42:27.550
Now get out of my ass.

42:27.552 --> 42:30.887
Mrs. Hayes, have a seat.
What can I do for you today?

42:30.889 --> 42:32.389
Where's Denise Watson?

42:32.391 --> 42:33.922
In the clanger.

42:33.924 --> 42:35.824
- On what charge?
- Possession.

42:35.826 --> 42:36.992
Of what?

42:36.994 --> 42:38.661
Two marijuana cigarettes.

42:38.663 --> 42:39.996
Big ones.

42:39.998 --> 42:41.264
When is the bail hearing?

42:41.266 --> 42:43.766
I asked the judge
not to give her bail

42:43.768 --> 42:46.636
on account of her previous
marijuana violations,

42:46.638 --> 42:48.070
and the judge said "sure."

42:48.072 --> 42:49.340
You fucking prick!

42:53.277 --> 42:55.945
You do not call an officer
of the law a fucking prick

42:55.947 --> 42:58.280
in his own station house,
Mrs. Hayes.

42:58.282 --> 43:00.051
Or anywhere, actually.

43:01.286 --> 43:03.753
What's with the new
attitude, Dixon?

43:03.755 --> 43:05.757
Your momma
been coaching you?

43:07.491 --> 43:08.560
No.

43:09.393 --> 43:10.759
My momma

43:10.761 --> 43:12.096
doesn't do that.

43:14.799 --> 43:17.101
Take them down,
you hear me?

43:18.668 --> 43:20.270
You did good, Dixon.

43:20.272 --> 43:22.273
Yeah, I know I did.

43:25.643 --> 43:27.842
Almost got that.

43:27.844 --> 43:30.311
The rules here are twofold.

43:30.313 --> 43:33.916
No kid can leave
this goddamn blanket

43:33.918 --> 43:36.219
at any goddamn time.

43:36.221 --> 43:38.186
And every single one

43:38.188 --> 43:40.956
of these dolls
and these teddy bears

43:40.958 --> 43:43.259
has got to be hooked up.

43:43.261 --> 43:45.128
Now, your momma and I,

43:45.130 --> 43:46.561
although it won't
look like it,

43:46.563 --> 43:50.333
we'll be watching
every goddamn move you make.

43:50.335 --> 43:53.503
So the most important thing
while we are watching you

43:53.505 --> 43:57.907
is that you do not
leave this blanket.

43:57.909 --> 44:03.244
Next most important thing,
you do not at any stage

44:03.246 --> 44:05.313
allow the fishing rods

44:05.315 --> 44:09.050
to stick into you
or your sister's eyeballs,

44:09.052 --> 44:11.786
as this would be
counter-productive

44:11.788 --> 44:14.223
to the entire operation.

44:14.225 --> 44:15.657
What would it be?

44:15.659 --> 44:20.896
Counter-productive
to the entire operation.

44:20.898 --> 44:22.634
Then, troops,

44:25.869 --> 44:27.438
start fishing.

44:30.475 --> 44:32.407
We are not.

44:32.409 --> 44:33.878
We are.

44:35.947 --> 44:37.215
Yes.

45:17.956 --> 45:19.624
Hey, baby.

45:24.027 --> 45:27.398
Yeah,
still no arrests.

45:29.900 --> 45:32.835
How come, I wonder?

45:32.837 --> 45:34.770
Because there ain't no God,
the whole world's empty,

45:34.772 --> 45:37.308
and it doesn't matter
what we do to each other?

45:39.911 --> 45:41.646
I hope not.

45:47.217 --> 45:48.617
How come
you came up here

45:48.619 --> 45:50.922
outta nowhere
looking so pretty?

45:52.522 --> 45:53.790
You ain't trying
to make me believe

45:53.792 --> 45:56.791
in reincarnation
or something, are you?

45:56.793 --> 45:59.598
Because you're pretty,
but you ain't her.

46:00.998 --> 46:03.032
She got killed,

46:03.034 --> 46:05.237
and now she's dead forever.

46:07.973 --> 46:09.608
I do thank you
for coming though.

46:11.743 --> 46:14.076
If I had some food
I'd give it to you.

46:14.078 --> 46:15.545
All I got is some Doritos.

46:15.547 --> 46:18.780
They might kill you,
they're kind of pointy.

46:18.782 --> 46:20.652
Then where would we be?

46:36.500 --> 46:40.103
Yeah, so I, uh,
just happened to be looking

46:40.105 --> 46:43.905
over our contract that we
drew up back that time.

46:43.907 --> 46:45.840
What I realized was I...

46:45.842 --> 46:49.277
I realized that although
payment is to be made

46:49.279 --> 46:50.779
on the first day
of each month,

46:50.781 --> 46:54.650
the first payment you paid
was actually a deposit.

46:54.652 --> 46:56.686
Wasn't it?
It's like we said.

46:56.688 --> 46:57.887
So, actually,
in point of fact,

46:57.889 --> 47:00.922
you're actually behind
in your payments now,

47:00.924 --> 47:03.291
by, yeah, a month.

47:03.293 --> 47:04.860
Yeah, that's, uh...

47:04.862 --> 47:09.498
It's what the contract says,
looking over it and all.

47:09.500 --> 47:12.300
The lawyer says so too.

47:12.302 --> 47:14.538
When you need
this next payment by, Red?

47:16.873 --> 47:18.375
Well, now, really.

47:21.413 --> 47:24.315
Or by... Uh...

47:25.081 --> 47:26.282
Friday?

47:26.284 --> 47:28.083
Wow.

47:28.085 --> 47:29.585
When you can't
trust the lawyers

47:29.587 --> 47:30.686
and the advertising men,

47:30.688 --> 47:33.288
what the hell's America
coming to, huh?

47:33.290 --> 47:35.190
Who got to you, Red?

47:35.192 --> 47:36.891
Willoughby?

47:36.893 --> 47:38.126
Nobody got to me.

47:38.128 --> 47:39.797
My fat fucking ass.

47:42.266 --> 47:43.898
He's dying, Mildred.

47:43.900 --> 47:46.469
We're all fucking dying!

47:46.471 --> 47:48.270
Hi, Pamela.
We're a little bit busy

47:48.272 --> 47:50.105
at the moment,
if that's okay.

47:50.107 --> 47:51.607
I know you were
real anxious

47:51.609 --> 47:53.041
about talking to Mrs. Hayes
this morning...

47:53.043 --> 47:54.009
Anxious? No.

47:54.011 --> 47:57.212
No need to be, because
you won't believe it!

47:57.214 --> 48:00.416
A little Mexican delivery boy
just dropped in with this.

48:00.418 --> 48:01.650
What the hell is this?

48:01.652 --> 48:02.583
I know!

48:02.585 --> 48:04.822
It's $5,000! And guess
what the note says?

48:06.089 --> 48:08.857
It says to pay for the rental
on Mrs. Hayes's billboards.

48:08.859 --> 48:11.259
Can you believe it?
That's why I butted in.

48:11.261 --> 48:12.393
Who's it from?

48:12.395 --> 48:13.762
Doesn't say.

48:13.764 --> 48:16.331
- Well, where's the delivery boy?
- He went.

48:16.333 --> 48:18.103
Did you see what company
he was from?

48:18.735 --> 48:19.634
No.

48:19.636 --> 48:22.237
What kind of uniform
did he have on?

48:22.239 --> 48:23.471
Well, he just looked
like one of those

48:23.473 --> 48:25.542
fat little Mexican boys.

48:26.076 --> 48:27.111
On a bicycle.

48:30.281 --> 48:31.480
Did I do
something wrong?

48:31.482 --> 48:33.148
No, Pam,
you did good.

48:33.150 --> 48:35.416
Yeah, Pamela,
you did real good.

48:35.418 --> 48:37.585
Did I? Oh, great.

48:37.587 --> 48:40.090
Ain't life crazy?

48:45.196 --> 48:46.531
What's the note say, Red?

48:48.900 --> 48:52.701
Says, "This here money
is to go towards the fund

48:52.703 --> 48:54.469
"for Mildred Hayes's
billboards,

48:54.471 --> 48:56.471
"because she ain't
the only one 'round here

48:56.473 --> 48:58.907
"who hates the pigs.
Signed, a friend."

48:58.909 --> 49:01.110
I guess you can't be too picky
about who your friends are

49:01.112 --> 49:02.113
these days, huh?

49:02.813 --> 49:04.913
Uh-huh, um...

49:04.915 --> 49:07.782
I guess I'll be needing
a receipt off you there, Red,

49:07.784 --> 49:09.617
you know, saying the price
of next month

49:09.619 --> 49:11.719
is paid in full and all.

49:11.721 --> 49:13.624
Oh, sure, Mildred, sure.

49:14.792 --> 49:15.858
Like now.

49:15.860 --> 49:16.925
Oh, sure.

49:21.264 --> 49:22.898
Is Mommy drunk, Daddy?

49:22.900 --> 49:25.733
No. She's just got a
little migraine, is all.

49:25.735 --> 49:27.969
Little Chardonnay
migraine.

49:27.971 --> 49:31.706
Now, no more chit-chat
outta you two, okay?

49:31.708 --> 49:34.809
Can we stay home from school
again tomorrow, Daddy?

49:34.811 --> 49:37.913
We'll see what your mommy
says in the morning, darling.

49:37.915 --> 49:39.313
Aw!

49:39.315 --> 49:41.453
Eyes closed

49:42.219 --> 49:44.656
and go to sleep, okay?

49:57.567 --> 50:01.335
You don't smell like puke,
which is good.

50:01.337 --> 50:04.239
Aquafresh.
Trick I learned.

50:04.241 --> 50:05.976
Women, huh?

50:07.610 --> 50:09.811
But it's still your turn
to clean the horseshit

50:09.813 --> 50:11.346
outta the stable,
you know.

50:11.348 --> 50:14.449
Those fucking horses.

50:14.451 --> 50:15.951
They're your fucking horses.

50:15.953 --> 50:18.223
I'm gonna have those
fucking horses shot!

50:19.322 --> 50:23.157
I'll do it,
you lazy bitch.

50:23.159 --> 50:24.793
Thank you, Poppa.

50:27.665 --> 50:29.868
That was a real nice day.

50:31.601 --> 50:34.004
That was a real nice fuck.

50:37.107 --> 50:39.474
You got a real nice cock,
Mr. Willoughby.

50:44.014 --> 50:46.014
Is that from a play?

50:46.016 --> 50:48.050
"You got a real nice cock,
Mr. Willoughby."

50:48.052 --> 50:52.020
I think I heard that
in a Shakespeare one time.

50:52.022 --> 50:54.155
You dummy.

50:54.157 --> 50:56.027
It's Oscar Wilde.

50:56.761 --> 50:57.761
Ah.

51:51.415 --> 51:53.217
Oscar Wilde.

52:21.877 --> 52:23.645
<i>My darling Anne,</i>

52:23.647 --> 52:25.813
<i>there's a longer letter
in the dresser drawer</i>

52:25.815 --> 52:28.116
<i>I've been writing
for the last week or so.</i>

52:28.118 --> 52:31.853
<i>That one covers us
and my memories of us</i>

52:31.855 --> 52:34.355
<i>and how much
I've always loved you.</i>

52:34.357 --> 52:39.128
<i>This one just covers tonight,
and more importantly, today.</i>

52:39.130 --> 52:42.197
<i>Tonight I've gone out
to the horses to end it.</i>

52:42.199 --> 52:44.933
<i>I cannot say sorry
for the act itself,</i>

52:44.935 --> 52:46.735
<i>although I know
that for a short time</i>

52:46.737 --> 52:49.070
<i>you will be angry at me
or even hate me for it.</i>

52:50.440 --> 52:51.773
<i>Please don't.</i>

52:51.775 --> 52:55.076
<i>This is not a case of,
"I came in this world alone</i>

52:55.078 --> 52:56.478
<i>"and I'm going
out of it alone,"</i>

52:56.480 --> 52:58.713
<i>or anything dumb like that.</i>

52:58.715 --> 53:01.116
<i>I did not come
in this world alone,</i>

53:01.118 --> 53:02.717
<i>my mom was there.</i>

53:02.719 --> 53:05.454
<i>And I am not
going out of it alone,</i>

53:05.456 --> 53:06.755
<i>because you are there,</i>

53:06.757 --> 53:11.826
<i>drunk on the couch,
making Oscar Wilde cock jokes.</i>

53:11.828 --> 53:14.963
<i>No, this is a case,
in some senses, of bravery.</i>

53:14.965 --> 53:17.699
<i>Not the bravery
of facing a bullet down.</i>

53:17.701 --> 53:19.166
<i>The next few months of pain</i>

53:19.168 --> 53:22.770
<i>would be far harder
than that small flash.</i>

53:22.772 --> 53:24.940
<i>No, it's the bravery
of weighing up</i>

53:24.942 --> 53:27.976
<i>the next few months
of still being with you,</i>

53:27.978 --> 53:32.181
<i>still waking up with you,
of playing with the kids</i>

53:32.183 --> 53:34.949
<i>against the next few months
of seeing in your eyes</i>

53:34.951 --> 53:37.652
<i>how much my pain
is killing you,</i>

53:37.654 --> 53:40.556
<i>how my weakened body,
as it ebbs away,</i>

53:40.558 --> 53:42.123
<i>and you tend to it,</i>

53:42.125 --> 53:45.828
<i>are your final and lasting
memories of me.</i>

53:45.830 --> 53:48.262
<i>I won't have that.</i>

53:48.264 --> 53:51.565
<i>Your final memories of me
will be us at the riverside</i>

53:51.567 --> 53:55.670
<i>and that dumb fishing game,
which I think they cheated at,</i>

53:55.672 --> 53:59.241
<i>and me inside of you
and you on top of me</i>

53:59.243 --> 54:04.480
<i>and barely a fleeting thought
of the darkness yet to come.</i>

54:04.482 --> 54:06.146
<i>That was the best, Anne.</i>

54:06.148 --> 54:09.585
<i>A whole day
of not thinking about it.</i>

54:09.587 --> 54:11.253
<i>Dwell on this day, baby,</i>

54:11.255 --> 54:14.590
<i>because it was the best day
of my life.</i>

54:14.592 --> 54:16.056
<i>Kiss the girls for me,</i>

54:16.058 --> 54:18.092
<i>and know that
I've always loved you,</i>

54:18.094 --> 54:21.029
<i>and maybe I'll see you again
if there's another place.</i>

54:21.031 --> 54:25.235
<i>And if there ain't, well,
it's been heaven knowing you.</i>

54:27.304 --> 54:28.906
<i>Your boy,</i>

54:30.273 --> 54:31.409
<i>Bill.</i>

55:27.163 --> 55:29.665
What the hell's
going on around here?

55:33.571 --> 55:34.839
What?

56:02.898 --> 56:04.835
Can you stand now?

56:05.601 --> 56:07.469
Yeah, I can stand.

56:10.706 --> 56:13.108
I'd better
get out there,

56:13.110 --> 56:16.011
say something to them.

56:16.013 --> 56:18.215
You ain't gonna
faint again, are you?

56:45.976 --> 56:49.578
<i>I know
that the best thing,</i>

56:49.580 --> 56:53.815
<i>the only thing to honor
that man's memory right now</i>

56:53.817 --> 56:55.518
<i>is to go to work.</i>

56:56.453 --> 56:59.357
<i>Is to be a good cop.</i>

57:00.857 --> 57:03.157
<i>To walk in his shoes</i>

57:03.159 --> 57:06.096
<i>and do what he did
every day of his life.</i>

57:06.864 --> 57:07.996
<i>Help people.</i>

57:40.130 --> 57:42.066
What the hell's going on?

57:59.049 --> 58:00.382
Where are you going, boy?

58:06.257 --> 58:09.961
You fucking pig!
What the fuck are you?

58:10.793 --> 58:12.263
Shut up.

58:32.982 --> 58:36.987
See, Red, I got issues
with white folks too.

58:43.226 --> 58:45.196
Fuck you looking at?

58:57.540 --> 59:00.474
<i>Reports,
sadly, have come in overnight,</i>

59:00.476 --> 59:03.043
<i>that Chief William Willoughby
of Ebbing, Missouri</i>

59:03.045 --> 59:05.346
<i>took his own life
early this morning</i>

<i>This report just in
from Gabriella Forrester.</i>

59:09.587 --> 59:11.251
<i>Tragedy
came calling today</i>

59:11.253 --> 59:14.822
<i>upon this quiet family home
outside Ebbing, Missouri,</i>

59:14.824 --> 59:17.257
belonging to
Chief Willoughby,

59:17.259 --> 59:19.661
his wife, Anne,
their two young daughters,

59:19.663 --> 59:21.329
Polly and Jane.

59:34.743 --> 59:36.844

59:36.846 --> 59:38.378
<i>There were rumors of illness.</i>

59:38.380 --> 59:40.748
<i>Could it simply have been
the pressures of the job?</i>

59:40.750 --> 59:43.518
<i>Or could it have something
to do with a story</i>

59:43.520 --> 59:46.188
<i>we ran here
just two weeks ago</i>

59:46.190 --> 59:47.556

Don't. Don't!

01:00:11.647 --> 01:00:12.682
Hi, there.

01:00:13.917 --> 01:00:15.382
You know
who threw that can?

01:00:15.384 --> 01:00:16.386
What can?

01:00:19.255 --> 01:00:21.690
How about you, sweetheart?
You know who threw that can?

01:00:21.692 --> 01:00:23.123
Uh, no, I didn't see.

01:00:32.802 --> 01:00:33.804
Thank you, Mom.

01:00:45.581 --> 01:00:48.282
And what can I do
for you today, sir?

01:00:48.284 --> 01:00:49.652
What's your name?

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:55.190
Name's on my tag, man.
You hard of reading?

01:00:55.192 --> 01:00:57.458
Hard of reading?
No, no.

01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:58.960
That's good,
"hard of reading".

01:00:58.962 --> 01:01:00.328
Kinda like
"hard of hearing",

01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:02.663
but it's actually
"hard of reading".

01:01:02.665 --> 01:01:04.534
Like a play on words
or something, huh?

01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:07.302
What do you want?

01:01:07.304 --> 01:01:09.237
I've been sent
to take over

01:01:09.239 --> 01:01:11.172
from Chief Willoughby

01:01:11.174 --> 01:01:13.007
in light of last night's
unfortunate event.

01:01:13.009 --> 01:01:15.778
You have got to be
fucking kidding me!

01:01:17.547 --> 01:01:22.150
Do you have any documentation
to prove that, sir?

01:01:22.152 --> 01:01:24.652
You really wanna see
my documentation, fucker?

01:01:24.654 --> 01:01:29.159
Yeah, see his documentation!
Make him show it to you.

01:01:30.761 --> 01:01:33.496
None of you cracker motherfuckers
got no work to do?

01:01:37.132 --> 01:01:38.468
Ain't that racist?

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.974
What happened to your hand,
Officer Dixon?

01:01:45.976 --> 01:01:48.275
Oh, I just kinda

01:01:48.277 --> 01:01:49.576
banged it up
a little bit

01:01:49.578 --> 01:01:52.047
while I was throwing some guy
out a fucking window.

01:01:52.049 --> 01:01:53.882
You know, the usual.

01:01:53.884 --> 01:01:54.882
Yeah?

01:01:54.884 --> 01:01:57.552
They never taught me
that one at the academy.

01:01:57.554 --> 01:02:00.224
Which fucking academy
you go to?

01:02:01.891 --> 01:02:05.326
How are things coming along
on that Angela Hayes case?

01:02:05.328 --> 01:02:06.494
How's things coming along

01:02:06.496 --> 01:02:08.429
on the mind your own
fucking business case?

01:02:08.431 --> 01:02:09.764
How are things
coming along

01:02:09.766 --> 01:02:11.969
on the hand me your gun
and your badge?

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.139
Huh?

01:02:17.141 --> 01:02:19.976
Hand me your gun
and your badge.

01:02:39.128 --> 01:02:40.531
Shit.

01:02:54.143 --> 01:02:55.812
It's in here somewhere.

01:03:03.252 --> 01:03:06.219
Hey, listen,
I can't find my badge.

01:03:06.221 --> 01:03:08.290
No, seriously.
Maybe I lost it.

01:03:08.292 --> 01:03:10.358
Dropped it when I was
doing that window guy.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.464
Just get the fuck out of
my station house, man.

01:03:38.221 --> 01:03:40.724
What's going on?

01:03:42.625 --> 01:03:45.492
I think I just got fired.

01:03:45.494 --> 01:03:47.996
Fired or suspended,
I'm not sure which.

01:03:47.998 --> 01:03:49.366
Fired.

01:04:19.728 --> 01:04:22.366
Anything I can help you with,
just give me a holler.

01:04:25.435 --> 01:04:28.471
Give Mildred Hayes

01:04:29.639 --> 01:04:30.907
a holler.

01:04:32.909 --> 01:04:34.078
Okay.

01:04:35.444 --> 01:04:37.177
You know me?

01:04:37.179 --> 01:04:40.384
Only from the TV
and the radio.

01:04:48.391 --> 01:04:49.523
How much these here

01:04:49.525 --> 01:04:51.759
"Welcome to Missouri"
rabbits go for?

01:04:51.761 --> 01:04:54.398
Seven bucks.
It's writ right on them.

01:05:02.471 --> 01:05:04.574
Guess he ain't
seven bucks now.

01:05:06.743 --> 01:05:08.275
What did you
come in here for?

01:05:08.277 --> 01:05:10.878
What did I
come in here for?

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.616
Maybe I'm a good friend of
Willoughby's, how about that?

01:05:14.683 --> 01:05:16.250
Are you?

01:05:16.252 --> 01:05:17.720
Or, you know...

01:05:19.755 --> 01:05:22.625
Maybe I was a friend of
your daughter or something.

01:05:23.393 --> 01:05:24.695
How about that?

01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:28.766
Were you?

01:05:31.734 --> 01:05:32.969
Or, um...

01:05:35.237 --> 01:05:36.503
You know,
maybe I was the one

01:05:36.505 --> 01:05:39.107
who fucked her
while she was dying.

01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:40.610
How about that?

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:44.782
Were you?

01:05:47.049 --> 01:05:48.151
No.

01:05:49.451 --> 01:05:51.087
I would have liked to.

01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:54.188
I saw her picture
in the paper there.

01:05:58.293 --> 01:06:00.695
Saved by the bell, huh?

01:06:00.697 --> 01:06:03.331
You owe me seven fucking
dollars for the rabbit.

01:06:04.801 --> 01:06:06.300
Guess you'll have to
get it off me

01:06:06.302 --> 01:06:07.835
next time
I'm passing through.

01:06:07.837 --> 01:06:08.971
Guess I will.

01:06:18.714 --> 01:06:21.416
You don't know how
glad I am to see you.

01:06:21.418 --> 01:06:22.483
What?

01:06:22.485 --> 01:06:24.018
That guy was
trying to scare me.

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:26.554
I wouldn't have said
you scare easy.

01:06:26.556 --> 01:06:28.058
I ain't the worst.

01:06:29.558 --> 01:06:31.558
What can I do
for you, ma'am?

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.759
My husband
left this for you

01:06:32.761 --> 01:06:35.465
before he shot himself
in the head last night.

01:06:39.703 --> 01:06:41.268
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Willoughby...

01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:42.605
Are you?

01:06:43.272 --> 01:06:44.838
Are you really?

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:47.976
- Sure, I am.
- Surely this is the perfect ending for you, isn't it?

01:06:47.978 --> 01:06:51.212
Proof those billboards
of yours were successful,

01:06:51.214 --> 01:06:53.047
a dead policeman?

01:06:53.049 --> 01:06:54.549
It's quantifiable now.

01:06:54.551 --> 01:06:55.916
Are you blaming
this on me?

01:06:55.918 --> 01:06:57.451
No.

01:06:57.453 --> 01:06:58.719
I'm not blaming
this on you.

01:06:58.721 --> 01:07:00.791
I just came
to give you the letter.

01:07:01.857 --> 01:07:03.757
Now my little girls
are out in the car,

01:07:03.759 --> 01:07:06.629
so I'd better not
stay and chat.

01:07:07.864 --> 01:07:09.329
I'm not quite sure
what we're gonna do

01:07:09.331 --> 01:07:10.868
for the rest of the day.

01:07:12.335 --> 01:07:14.569
It's hard to know
what to do

01:07:14.571 --> 01:07:17.404
the day your husband
kills himself.

01:07:17.406 --> 01:07:18.975
It's hard to know
what to do.

01:07:48.871 --> 01:07:50.704
<i>Dear Mildred,</i>

01:07:50.706 --> 01:07:52.773
<i>Dead Man Willoughby here.</i>

01:07:52.775 --> 01:07:55.108
<i>Firstly, I wanted
to apologize for dying</i>

01:07:55.110 --> 01:07:57.911
<i>without catching
your daughter's killer.</i>

01:07:57.913 --> 01:07:59.646
<i>It's a source
of great pain to me,</i>

01:07:59.648 --> 01:08:01.449
<i>and it would
break my heart to think</i>

01:08:01.451 --> 01:08:05.319
<i>you thought I didn't care.
I did.</i>

01:08:05.321 --> 01:08:06.987
<i>There are just some cases</i>

01:08:06.989 --> 01:08:09.657
<i>where you never
catch a break,</i>

01:08:09.659 --> 01:08:11.592
<i>then five years
down the line</i>

01:08:11.594 --> 01:08:13.594
<i>some guy hears
some other guy</i>

01:08:13.596 --> 01:08:17.532
<i>bragging about it
in a bar room or a jail cell</i>

01:08:17.533 --> 01:08:19.134
<i>and the whole thing
is wrapped up</i>

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:20.935
<i>through sheer stupidity.</i>

01:08:20.937 --> 01:08:24.537
<i>I hope that might be true
for Angela, I really do.</i>

01:08:24.538 --> 01:08:27.207
<i>Second, I gotta admit,
Mildred,</i>

01:08:27.209 --> 01:08:30.711
<i>the billboards were
a great fucking idea.</i>

01:08:30.712 --> 01:08:32.845
<i>They were like a chess move.</i>

01:08:32.848 --> 01:08:35.149
<i>And although they had
absolutely nothing</i>

01:08:35.151 --> 01:08:36.684
<i>to do with my dying,</i>

01:08:36.685 --> 01:08:38.417
<i>I'm sure that
everyone in town</i>

01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:40.220
<i>will assume that they did,</i>

01:08:40.221 --> 01:08:42.790
<i>which is why, for
Willoughby's counter-move,</i>

01:08:42.792 --> 01:08:45.826
<i>I decided to pay
the next month's rent on them.</i>

01:08:45.828 --> 01:08:48.729
<i>I thought it would be funny,
you having to defend them</i>

01:08:48.731 --> 01:08:49.895
<i>another whole month</i>

01:08:49.898 --> 01:08:52.867
<i>after they've stuck me
in the ground.</i>

01:08:52.868 --> 01:08:55.470
<i>The joke is on you,
Mildred, ha ha,</i>

01:08:55.471 --> 01:08:57.640
<i>and I hope
they do not kill you.</i>

01:08:58.573 --> 01:08:59.939
<i>So good luck with all that,</i>

01:08:59.942 --> 01:09:02.779
<i>and good luck
with everything else too.</i>

01:09:03.879 --> 01:09:06.782
<i>I hope and I pray
that you get him.</i>

01:09:23.799 --> 01:09:27.734
Well, you want me to go
down and talk to them?

01:09:27.736 --> 01:09:30.671
No, I don't want you to
go down and talk to them.

01:09:30.673 --> 01:09:32.140
Somebody sending
their goddamn mother

01:09:32.142 --> 01:09:34.211
down to talk
to the goddamn police?

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.546
To say what?

01:09:39.548 --> 01:09:42.349
To say to give you
your job back.

01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:43.886
Get rid
of that black guy.

01:09:45.488 --> 01:09:46.886
Ain't gonna listen
to some guy's mother

01:09:46.889 --> 01:09:49.091
asking them to get rid
of some black guy.

01:09:50.026 --> 01:09:51.823
Things have moved on
in the South.

01:09:51.826 --> 01:09:53.696
Well, it shouldn't have!

01:09:55.164 --> 01:09:59.169
Will they give you some money
for being laid off and all?

01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:03.170
I don't know what the
compensation scheme is

01:10:03.172 --> 01:10:05.907
for when you throw a guy
out of a window, Ma.

01:10:05.909 --> 01:10:07.641
Guess I should have
looked into that beforehand.

01:10:07.643 --> 01:10:09.810
Let me Google that.

01:10:09.812 --> 01:10:12.512
A couple of grand, maybe?

01:10:12.514 --> 01:10:14.215
You been there three years.

01:10:14.217 --> 01:10:18.155
Not counting the five years
at the academy.

01:10:19.356 --> 01:10:20.653
Six,

01:10:20.655 --> 01:10:22.993
if you count the year
you were held back.

01:10:25.462 --> 01:10:27.528
Where are you going?

01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:29.529
None of your business.

01:10:29.531 --> 01:10:31.966
Off to see your fancy woman?

01:10:31.968 --> 01:10:33.534
I don't got a fancy woman.

01:10:33.536 --> 01:10:36.336
Yeah. I know.

01:10:36.338 --> 01:10:38.773
Hey, you wanna
watch yourself.

01:10:38.775 --> 01:10:41.011
Or, or you'll do what?

01:10:44.347 --> 01:10:47.084
I'll blow your goddamn
head off, that's what.

01:10:57.494 --> 01:10:59.092
Oh,
did you hear the news?

01:10:59.094 --> 01:11:00.027
What news?

01:11:00.029 --> 01:11:01.695
That Dixon guy
threw that Welby guy

01:11:01.697 --> 01:11:03.864
out of his window
this morning.

01:11:03.866 --> 01:11:05.435
You're shitting me.

01:11:10.606 --> 01:11:12.305
Is he okay?

01:11:12.307 --> 01:11:13.509
Mmm-mmm.

01:11:18.513 --> 01:11:20.180
- You're shitting me!
- Whoa!

01:11:20.182 --> 01:11:23.319
Holy shit!
Holy shit!

01:11:23.753 --> 01:11:25.322
Holy shit!

01:11:26.255 --> 01:11:27.324
Fuck!

01:11:30.793 --> 01:11:32.192
Get the other one
from the house.

01:11:32.194 --> 01:11:33.993
Shouldn't I call
the fire department?

01:11:33.995 --> 01:11:36.463
Fuck them.
They probably started it.

01:11:36.465 --> 01:11:38.134
Don't do anything stupid!

01:11:39.502 --> 01:11:40.935
Scumbags!

01:11:40.937 --> 01:11:43.340
Fucking, fucking scumbags!

01:12:16.772 --> 01:12:18.206
Shit!

01:12:18.208 --> 01:12:19.509
All right!

01:12:41.530 --> 01:12:43.098
Are you kidding me?

01:12:48.036 --> 01:12:50.173
What the hell
are you doing?

01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.680
Okay. Good. Come on.

01:12:59.682 --> 01:13:01.415
Leave it! Ma, please!

01:13:01.417 --> 01:13:02.886
It's too late!

01:13:06.054 --> 01:13:07.720
- Robbie...
- Leave it! Please!

01:13:07.722 --> 01:13:09.158
Robbie!

01:13:38.454 --> 01:13:40.089
How are those hands?

01:13:41.991 --> 01:13:44.127
Give us a minute here.
Thank you.

01:13:47.362 --> 01:13:49.262
Can I ask you
a couple of questions?

01:13:49.264 --> 01:13:51.030
You can ask me all the
questions you want,

01:13:51.032 --> 01:13:53.266
you take me down
and arrest me.

01:13:53.268 --> 01:13:54.635
I'm not gonna arrest you,
Mrs. Hayes.

01:13:54.637 --> 01:13:56.205
I got nothing
to arrest you for.

01:13:58.641 --> 01:14:00.243
Not yet you ain't.

01:14:06.281 --> 01:14:08.485
We ain't all the enemy,
you know.

01:14:26.268 --> 01:14:30.205
I'll crucify
the motherfuckers.

01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:43.149
What are
you gonna do, Mildred?

01:14:43.151 --> 01:14:45.086
You gonna crucify them?

01:14:45.088 --> 01:14:48.288
Yeah, I'm gonna crucify them.

01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:50.390
Who you gonna crucify?

01:14:50.392 --> 01:14:52.492
The motherfuckers?

01:14:52.494 --> 01:14:54.628
Yeah, I'm gonna

01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:57.064
crucify the motherfuckers.

01:14:57.066 --> 01:14:59.132
Ooh, then those motherfuckers

01:14:59.134 --> 01:15:02.336
better watch out, all right?

01:15:05.674 --> 01:15:07.276
Fucking A.

01:15:11.079 --> 01:15:12.546
What's this shit?

01:15:12.548 --> 01:15:14.381
And as sad as the spectacle

01:15:14.383 --> 01:15:16.483
of these burned out
billboards might be,

01:15:16.485 --> 01:15:18.252
in light of the death
of Chief Willoughby,

01:15:18.254 --> 01:15:19.820
this reporter for one

01:15:19.822 --> 01:15:21.220
wonders if this
finally puts an end

01:15:21.222 --> 01:15:23.791
to the strange saga
of the three billboards...

01:15:23.793 --> 01:15:26.092
This doesn't put an end
to shit, you fucking retard,

01:15:26.094 --> 01:15:27.728
this is just
the fucking start!

01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:28.962
Why don't you
put that on your

01:15:28.964 --> 01:15:32.201
<i>Good Morning Missouri</i> fucking
<i>Wake Up</i> broadcast, bitch!

01:15:41.576 --> 01:15:44.244
I see on the TV there
were a bunch of fires

01:15:44.246 --> 01:15:46.482
lit outside of town
last night.

01:15:48.151 --> 01:15:49.753
Bunch of fires, huh?

01:15:50.753 --> 01:15:53.023
Out at those billboards.

01:15:54.557 --> 01:15:56.524
Back when I was a cop
I would have been

01:15:56.526 --> 01:15:58.257
interested in
who set those fires,

01:15:58.259 --> 01:16:00.293
because, technically,
that's arson,

01:16:00.295 --> 01:16:02.195
but as I'm no longer
employed by those people,

01:16:02.197 --> 01:16:04.732
I don't really
give a goddamn.

01:16:07.636 --> 01:16:09.105
I'll get it.

01:16:14.477 --> 01:16:15.576
Dixon residence.

01:16:15.578 --> 01:16:17.545
<i>Hey, Dixon, it's Cedric.</i>

01:16:17.547 --> 01:16:21.082
Oh, hey, Sarge.
You got any news?

01:16:21.084 --> 01:16:23.219
- <i>News about what?</i>
- I don't know.

01:16:25.087 --> 01:16:27.889
About my job and stuff?

01:16:27.891 --> 01:16:30.257
No. No. What?

01:16:30.259 --> 01:16:31.558
No.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:35.162
Anne Willoughby
just dropped in a letter

01:16:35.164 --> 01:16:36.898
that Bill wrote you
before he died.

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:38.299
What's it say?

01:16:38.301 --> 01:16:40.967
I haven't read it,
it's not my letter.

01:16:40.969 --> 01:16:42.903
Oh, well, listen,
I'll come right down.

01:16:42.905 --> 01:16:45.538
Um, I'll be there
in like 15 minutes.

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.373
Well... Uh...

01:16:47.375 --> 01:16:52.912
Not such a great idea,
things as they stand, Jason.

01:16:52.914 --> 01:16:54.348
<i>You still got your keys</i>

01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:56.516
<i>to the station house,
though, right?</i>

01:16:56.518 --> 01:16:57.484
Yeah.

01:16:57.486 --> 01:16:59.920
<i>Why don't you
come and pick it up</i>

01:16:59.922 --> 01:17:02.256
<i>after everyone's gone home?</i>

01:17:02.258 --> 01:17:04.494
<i>I can leave it
on your desk for you.</i>

01:17:05.794 --> 01:17:07.193
Oh, okay.

01:17:07.195 --> 01:17:08.730
<i>Actually, yeah, then</i>

01:17:09.398 --> 01:17:11.534
when you're done, you can

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.600
just leave the keys,

01:17:14.602 --> 01:17:17.272
you know, save us
picking them up later.

01:17:19.907 --> 01:17:21.244
All right.

01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:50.970
<i>Jason, Willoughby here.</i>

01:17:50.972 --> 01:17:53.439
<i>I'm dead now,
sorry about that.</i>

01:17:53.441 --> 01:17:55.141
<i>There's something
I wanted to say to you</i>

01:17:55.143 --> 01:17:57.646
<i>that I never really said
when I was alive.</i>

01:17:59.114 --> 01:18:00.648
<i>I think you've got the makings</i>

01:18:00.650 --> 01:18:03.717
<i>of being
a really good cop, Jason.</i>

01:18:03.719 --> 01:18:05.187
<i>And you know why?</i>

01:18:06.422 --> 01:18:10.323
<i>Because deep down
you're a decent man.</i>

01:18:10.325 --> 01:18:12.393
<i>I know you don't think
I think that,</i>

01:18:12.395 --> 01:18:14.429
<i>but I do, dipshit.</i>

01:18:21.437 --> 01:18:23.907
<i>I do think
you're too angry, though.</i>

01:18:26.542 --> 01:18:28.442
<i>And I know it's all
since your dad died,</i>

01:18:28.444 --> 01:18:31.414
<i>and you had to go
look after your mom.</i>

01:18:34.150 --> 01:18:37.283
<i>But as long as you hold on
to so much hate,</i>

01:18:37.285 --> 01:18:40.086
<i>then I don't think
you're ever gonna become</i>

01:18:40.088 --> 01:18:42.424
<i>what I know
you wanna become.</i>

01:18:45.027 --> 01:18:46.560
<i>A detective.</i>

01:18:52.701 --> 01:18:55.168
<i>Because you know what you
need to become a detective?</i>

01:18:56.572 --> 01:18:59.073
<i>And I know you're gonna wince
when I say this...</i>

01:19:00.976 --> 01:19:06.449
<i>But what you need to become
a detective is love.</i>

01:19:07.182 --> 01:19:08.384
Fuck 'em.

01:19:15.523 --> 01:19:18.192
<i>Because through love
comes calm,</i>

01:19:18.194 --> 01:19:20.827
<i>and through calm
comes thought.</i>

01:19:20.829 --> 01:19:24.701
<i>And you need thought to detect
stuff sometimes, Jason.</i>

01:19:30.205 --> 01:19:32.238
<i>It's kinda all you need.</i>

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:33.808
<i>You don't even need a gun.</i>

01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:36.443
<i>And you definitely
don't need hate.</i>

01:19:36.445 --> 01:19:38.414
<i>Hate never solved nothing.</i>

01:19:43.451 --> 01:19:45.818
<i>But calm did.
And thought did.</i>

01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:48.690
<i>Try it. Try it
just for a change.</i>

01:19:50.392 --> 01:19:51.958
<i>No one will think
you're gay.</i>

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:55.261
<i>And if they do,
arrest them for homophobia.</i>

01:19:55.263 --> 01:19:58.299
<i>Won't they be surprised.</i>

01:19:58.301 --> 01:20:01.400
<i>Good luck to you, Jason,
you're a decent man.</i>

01:20:01.402 --> 01:20:04.273
<i>And yeah, you've had
a run of bad luck,</i>

01:20:05.508 --> 01:20:08.978
<i>but things are gonna change for you.
I can feel it.</i>

01:20:39.008 --> 01:20:40.076
Calm.

01:20:41.142 --> 01:20:42.444
Calm.

01:20:43.879 --> 01:20:44.947
Calm.

01:22:05.861 --> 01:22:06.894
What did you see?

01:22:06.896 --> 01:22:09.395
When we turned the corner
from Spring,

01:22:09.397 --> 01:22:11.765
the fire was
already raging, and

01:22:11.767 --> 01:22:13.900
about two seconds later
the cop fella,

01:22:13.902 --> 01:22:15.269
he just jumps
out of the window.

01:22:15.271 --> 01:22:19.142
Wait... The two of you turned
the corner from Spring?

01:22:20.174 --> 01:22:21.442
Where were you
before this?

01:22:21.444 --> 01:22:22.879
Round my place.

01:22:25.815 --> 01:22:27.984
You two boyfriend
and girlfriend?

01:22:30.419 --> 01:22:32.088
Early stages, you know.

01:22:33.521 --> 01:22:35.055
Is that right?

01:22:35.057 --> 01:22:36.726
We had a couple of dates.

01:22:46.736 --> 01:22:49.071
You wanna go out to
dinner with me next week?

01:22:50.405 --> 01:22:52.607
Yeah, I'll go out
to dinner with you.

01:22:55.244 --> 01:22:56.879
But I ain't gonna
fuck you.

01:22:57.879 --> 01:23:00.750
Well, I... I ain't gonna
fuck you neither.

01:23:03.151 --> 01:23:04.620
I guess.

01:23:18.968 --> 01:23:22.138
Burn victim. He's
pretty heavily sedated.

01:23:31.446 --> 01:23:34.314
Hey, man.
You doing okay?

01:23:34.316 --> 01:23:38.788
Jeez, you got burned up
pretty bad, huh?

01:23:41.056 --> 01:23:42.792
You'll be okay though.

01:23:43.825 --> 01:23:46.561
You want a glass
of orange juice?

01:23:47.294 --> 01:23:48.929
I got a straw somewhere.

01:23:50.331 --> 01:23:51.801
Hey, hey...

01:23:52.901 --> 01:23:54.169
Don't cry.

01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:57.806
You'll be okay.

01:24:00.642 --> 01:24:02.712
I'm sorry, Welby.

01:24:06.181 --> 01:24:07.280
You know me?

01:24:07.282 --> 01:24:08.651
I'm sorry.

01:24:11.053 --> 01:24:13.022
You're sorry for what?

01:24:14.656 --> 01:24:16.691
Throwing you
out the window.

01:24:24.232 --> 01:24:25.466
Sorry.

01:24:25.468 --> 01:24:27.400
I don't care!

01:24:27.402 --> 01:24:30.403
Stop fucking crying,
God damn it!

01:24:30.405 --> 01:24:32.773
The salt will just
fuck up your wounds.

01:24:32.775 --> 01:24:35.708
I thought it was
good for wounds.

01:24:35.710 --> 01:24:37.914
What am I,
a fucking doctor?

01:25:47.482 --> 01:25:48.814
Who is it?

01:25:48.816 --> 01:25:50.919
Oh, you don't
know me really.

01:25:53.688 --> 01:25:55.822
Well, what do you want?

01:25:55.824 --> 01:25:58.158
I come about the billboards.

01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.493
What about them?

01:25:59.495 --> 01:26:01.060
They got burned up.

01:26:01.062 --> 01:26:02.863
I know that.

01:26:02.865 --> 01:26:05.935
I'm one of the guys who put
them up in the first place.

01:26:09.570 --> 01:26:10.805
Jerome.

01:26:12.606 --> 01:26:14.306
What can I do
for you, Jerome?

01:26:14.308 --> 01:26:16.577
When you put up a bunch
of posters like that...

01:26:16.579 --> 01:26:20.145
Just in case any of them get
screwed up or torn, they...

01:26:20.147 --> 01:26:22.817
Give you a set of
duplicates, you know?

01:26:23.785 --> 01:26:25.421
No, I didn't know that.

01:26:33.995 --> 01:26:36.998
Ladder's pretty steady
as it is there, James.

01:26:38.667 --> 01:26:41.201
That's okay.
I like holding ladders.

01:26:41.203 --> 01:26:42.338
Takes me out of myself.

01:26:47.609 --> 01:26:49.109
- Need a hand?
- Hey.

01:26:50.145 --> 01:26:52.512
- When did you get out?
- An hour ago.

01:26:52.514 --> 01:26:53.747
Judge threw it out.

01:26:53.749 --> 01:26:55.381
Said the arrest report
weren't filled out right.

01:26:55.383 --> 01:26:56.852
Mmm.

01:26:57.352 --> 01:26:58.387
Say, you...

01:27:02.124 --> 01:27:04.925
You didn't burn down the
police station, did you?

01:27:04.927 --> 01:27:07.295
No, she was with me
the whole night.

01:27:09.231 --> 01:27:11.398
- Why would you...
- It's a long story.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:12.902
Hey.

01:27:13.235 --> 01:27:15.034
Hey.

01:27:15.036 --> 01:27:16.702
Still wanna put up
the Willoughby one,

01:27:16.704 --> 01:27:18.270
him being dead and all?

01:27:18.272 --> 01:27:20.674
Why not?
He paid for it.

01:27:20.676 --> 01:27:21.977
True.

01:27:33.888 --> 01:27:36.292
Look at this
fucking asshole.

01:28:11.726 --> 01:28:13.896
- First round is on you?
- Yeah.

01:28:29.878 --> 01:28:31.413
Well, here we are.

01:28:33.581 --> 01:28:35.183
Here we are.

01:28:37.386 --> 01:28:38.885
I like cheesy things.

01:28:38.887 --> 01:28:40.822
I'm gonna look
for cheesy things.

01:28:41.757 --> 01:28:42.991
All right.

01:28:49.763 --> 01:28:51.598
Who's that?

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:53.166
My ex-husband.

01:28:53.168 --> 01:28:55.404
And his
19-year-old girlfriend.

01:28:58.639 --> 01:28:59.773
You wanna leave?

01:28:59.775 --> 01:29:02.244
No, no. Deal's a deal.

01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:06.078
It was fucking wild.

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:08.348
I think I was certifiably
fucking insane

01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:09.485
for a while back then.

01:29:10.218 --> 01:29:11.818
When was this?

01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:13.420
About nine,
ten months ago.

01:29:13.422 --> 01:29:14.420
Were you on your own?

01:29:14.422 --> 01:29:16.390
I had a couple
of buddies with me.

01:29:16.392 --> 01:29:18.390
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:29:18.392 --> 01:29:20.560
They fuck her too?

01:29:20.562 --> 01:29:23.697
I think they got their
kicks just watching, you know.

01:29:23.699 --> 01:29:25.265
Oh, yeah?

01:29:25.267 --> 01:29:26.466
Yeah.

01:29:26.468 --> 01:29:27.734
Was she hot?

01:29:27.736 --> 01:29:29.970
Once the gasoline
kicked in she was hot.

01:29:31.139 --> 01:29:32.805
Swear, I wanted
to fuck her even more

01:29:32.807 --> 01:29:34.342
right then and there.

01:29:35.945 --> 01:29:38.511
I don't know if I could
get that out of my mind.

01:30:19.722 --> 01:30:21.086
I ain't going down
for that shit,

01:30:21.088 --> 01:30:23.057
last fucking day
down there.

01:30:30.097 --> 01:30:32.165
He been there
the whole time?

01:30:32.167 --> 01:30:33.300
Who?

01:30:33.302 --> 01:30:36.403
Burnt face Jake. Keeps
fucking walking up and down.

01:30:36.405 --> 01:30:38.340
I don't know.
I don't think so.

01:30:46.647 --> 01:30:48.116
- Another round?
- Yeah.

01:30:51.652 --> 01:30:52.987
Eight bucks.

01:31:25.285 --> 01:31:26.387
Maestro.

01:31:31.258 --> 01:31:32.926
Can I help you
with something?

01:31:32.928 --> 01:31:34.460
Excuse me?

01:31:34.462 --> 01:31:36.229
Looking over here
all fucking night.

01:31:36.231 --> 01:31:38.198
Unless you've got
something to say,

01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:39.899
why don't you take
your burnt fucking face

01:31:39.901 --> 01:31:41.236
and get the fuck
out of here?

01:31:44.405 --> 01:31:45.738
What are you doing?

01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:48.507
Wait, wait, wait...

01:31:48.509 --> 01:31:52.146
Just trust me, okay?
Do you like magic?

01:31:55.683 --> 01:31:56.815
Just trust me.

01:31:56.817 --> 01:31:58.454
Just do the fucking
trick, man.

01:32:00.254 --> 01:32:01.289
Okay.

01:32:10.098 --> 01:32:11.299
What the fuck!

01:32:14.203 --> 01:32:15.270
Hey.

01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:17.502
Hey!

01:32:17.504 --> 01:32:19.838
- That's enough!
- What's it to you, fucker?

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:21.073
Guy is a cop, man.
He's a cop.

01:32:21.075 --> 01:32:23.242
Oh, yeah?

01:32:23.244 --> 01:32:24.713
He ain't wearing
no badge.

01:32:25.446 --> 01:32:26.748
I lost my badge.

01:32:28.348 --> 01:32:30.448
Can't remember
where I lost it.

01:32:30.450 --> 01:32:33.254
You started this.
I didn't do shit to you!

01:32:33.989 --> 01:32:35.521
I know I started it.

01:32:35.523 --> 01:32:38.123
I scratched you up
like a bitch.

01:32:38.125 --> 01:32:39.891
That's exactly
fucking right.

01:32:56.645 --> 01:32:58.781
I'm gonna go use
the little boy's room.

01:33:10.191 --> 01:33:11.491
You got something
to say to me?

01:33:11.493 --> 01:33:13.426
If I'd known, we could
have double dated.

01:33:13.428 --> 01:33:16.528
Doesn't shit girl
have a curfew weeknights?

01:33:16.530 --> 01:33:17.697
No.

01:33:17.699 --> 01:33:20.866
I was gonna take her
to the circus later,

01:33:20.868 --> 01:33:22.068
but there's no need now.

01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:23.470
Does he juggle?

01:33:23.472 --> 01:33:27.006
I'm having dinner
because he did me a favor.

01:33:27.008 --> 01:33:28.942
You don't
have to explain

01:33:28.944 --> 01:33:30.510
why you're having dinner
with a midget.

01:33:30.512 --> 01:33:32.479
I'm not explaining
myself to you.

01:33:32.481 --> 01:33:33.749
You kind of are.

01:33:38.687 --> 01:33:41.186
I didn't come here
to break your balls.

01:33:41.188 --> 01:33:43.624
You can date as many
midgets as you want.

01:33:45.293 --> 01:33:48.694
I came to say
I was sorry, actually.

01:33:48.696 --> 01:33:50.329
Sorry for what?

01:33:50.331 --> 01:33:52.465
Sorry about what happened
to your billboards and all.

01:33:52.467 --> 01:33:55.667
It's all water under
the bridge, I guess.

01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:57.036
Good.

01:33:57.038 --> 01:33:58.537
I'm glad.
I was pretty drunk,

01:33:58.539 --> 01:34:01.209
but it still
don't excuse it.

01:34:02.945 --> 01:34:05.478
All this anger, man.

01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:08.413
Penelope said to me
the other day...

01:34:08.415 --> 01:34:11.486
"It just begets
greater anger."

01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:14.690
You know? It's true.

01:34:17.292 --> 01:34:19.194
Penelope
said "begets"?

01:34:20.628 --> 01:34:21.697
Yeah.

01:34:22.463 --> 01:34:25.199
"It begets
greater anger."

01:34:28.002 --> 01:34:29.735
Well...

01:34:29.737 --> 01:34:33.038
You take care of this
little lady, okay, sport?

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.710
Big lady
compared to you, right?

01:34:45.285 --> 01:34:48.186
- You all right?
- I think I wanna go home now.

01:34:48.188 --> 01:34:49.387
Don't give me
any shit, James.

01:34:49.389 --> 01:34:51.459
We'll do it another night,
all right?

01:34:52.259 --> 01:34:54.126
Why would I want to?

01:34:54.128 --> 01:34:57.630
You've been embarrassed
ever since we arrived.

01:34:57.632 --> 01:35:00.131
For Christ sake.
I didn't force you

01:35:00.133 --> 01:35:03.171
to come on this date.
You forced me.

01:35:04.905 --> 01:35:06.307
Forced you?

01:35:07.508 --> 01:35:09.641
I asked you on a date.

01:35:09.643 --> 01:35:12.077
Wow. You know...

01:35:12.079 --> 01:35:16.382
I know I'm
not that much of a catch.

01:35:16.384 --> 01:35:18.818
I know I'm a dwarf
who sells used cars

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:20.952
and has a drinking problem.

01:35:20.954 --> 01:35:22.555
But who the hell
are you, man?

01:35:22.557 --> 01:35:24.791
You're that
billboard lady who

01:35:24.793 --> 01:35:25.891
never smiles,

01:35:25.893 --> 01:35:28.260
never has a good word
to say about anybody,

01:35:28.262 --> 01:35:30.063
and who,
in the evening times,

01:35:30.065 --> 01:35:31.866
sets fucking fire
to police stations!

01:35:33.535 --> 01:35:36.738
And I'm the one
who's not a catch?

01:35:38.705 --> 01:35:39.740
Hey!

01:35:41.542 --> 01:35:45.213
You know, I didn't have to
come and hold your ladder.

01:36:10.871 --> 01:36:12.540
Now, don't make a scene.

01:36:15.043 --> 01:36:18.877
Did you really tell him
"Anger begets greater anger"?

01:36:18.879 --> 01:36:20.747
Oh! Yes! I did.

01:36:20.749 --> 01:36:22.348
I didn't make it up
myself though.

01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:23.582
I can't claim that.

01:36:23.584 --> 01:36:25.987
No, I read it
on a bookmark.

01:36:27.588 --> 01:36:29.624
Which was in a book
I was reading.

01:36:30.991 --> 01:36:32.460
About polio.

01:36:33.594 --> 01:36:36.363
Polo. No. Which is the
one with the horses?

01:36:36.365 --> 01:36:37.697
Polio or polo?

01:36:37.699 --> 01:36:38.967
- Polo.
- Polo.

01:36:50.011 --> 01:36:51.812
Be nice to her,
Charlie.

01:36:53.748 --> 01:36:54.982
You got that?

01:37:08.295 --> 01:37:10.395
Jason!

01:37:10.397 --> 01:37:12.064
- Jason.
- Don't look at me.

01:37:12.066 --> 01:37:13.198
What have they
done to you?

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:14.402
Leave me, Momma.

01:37:15.335 --> 01:37:17.002
No. No!

01:37:20.173 --> 01:37:21.776
Open up this door!

01:37:22.410 --> 01:37:24.045
Please, Jason.

01:37:24.945 --> 01:37:27.581
I love you. Please.

01:37:30.151 --> 01:37:33.955
You're my baby boy.
Open this door.

01:37:34.789 --> 01:37:35.956
Please.

01:37:38.026 --> 01:37:40.126
Jason, please.

01:37:43.230 --> 01:37:44.566
Please.

01:37:45.165 --> 01:37:47.768
Please open the door.

01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:57.512
Open up!

01:37:59.179 --> 01:38:01.747
Jason!

01:38:01.749 --> 01:38:05.786
I'm all right, Momma.
It's all gonna be all right.

01:38:29.744 --> 01:38:31.411
I don't wanna get your
hopes up, all right,

01:38:31.413 --> 01:38:33.179
but there is a guy,
and I think

01:38:33.181 --> 01:38:36.681
he might be the guy.
I got his DNA.

01:38:36.683 --> 01:38:38.751
Got a lot of it,
actually.

01:38:38.753 --> 01:38:41.121
They're making the checks
as we speak.

01:38:41.123 --> 01:38:42.854
He's in jail?

01:38:42.856 --> 01:38:46.559
No, but he ain't
gonna be hard to find.

01:38:46.561 --> 01:38:48.159
Why do you think
he's the guy?

01:38:48.161 --> 01:38:49.360
I heard him
talking about

01:38:49.362 --> 01:38:52.264
something he did
to a girl last year.

01:38:52.266 --> 01:38:54.102
I couldn't hear
all of it, but...

01:38:55.436 --> 01:38:58.807
It sounded a lot like
what happened to Angela.

01:38:59.906 --> 01:39:02.041
And then he beat
the crap out of me.

01:39:02.043 --> 01:39:03.609
But because of that,

01:39:03.611 --> 01:39:05.614
I got a bunch of his DNA.

01:39:06.347 --> 01:39:07.916
So, I wanted to

01:39:08.782 --> 01:39:11.350
let you know sooner
rather than later.

01:39:11.352 --> 01:39:13.155
I didn't want you
to give up hope.

01:39:14.588 --> 01:39:16.555
I've been trying
not to.

01:39:16.557 --> 01:39:20.359
Well...
All you can do is try.

01:39:20.361 --> 01:39:22.494
As my momma says,

01:39:22.496 --> 01:39:24.633
it's not so much
about hope as about...

01:39:26.468 --> 01:39:27.867
Well, I didn't used to be

01:39:27.869 --> 01:39:29.868
very good at English
at school.

01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:31.537
So it was more
"All you can do is try

01:39:31.539 --> 01:39:34.176
"to not be so crap
at English."

01:39:36.878 --> 01:39:40.512
Because you need English,
really, if you wanna be a cop.

01:39:40.514 --> 01:39:43.185
If you wanna be
anything, really.

01:39:49.423 --> 01:39:51.892
Unless you live in Mexico
or something.

01:39:52.893 --> 01:39:54.562
Who wants that?

01:40:15.583 --> 01:40:16.785
Hey, Dixon?

01:40:22.190 --> 01:40:23.225
Thank you.

01:40:57.258 --> 01:40:58.960
You did good, Jason.

01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.161
You did real good.

01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:11.739
But he wasn't the guy.

01:41:19.213 --> 01:41:20.445
What?

01:41:20.447 --> 01:41:22.582
There was no match
to the DNA.

01:41:22.584 --> 01:41:25.417
No matches to any other
crimes of this nature.

01:41:25.419 --> 01:41:28.153
To any crimes at all,
in fact.

01:41:28.155 --> 01:41:29.858
And his record is clean.

01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:32.561
Maybe he was
just bragging.

01:41:33.393 --> 01:41:34.626
He wasn't just bragging.

01:41:34.628 --> 01:41:36.362
Well, that's as may be.

01:41:36.364 --> 01:41:38.663
But at the time
of Angela's death,

01:41:38.665 --> 01:41:40.934
he wasn't even
in the country.

01:41:40.936 --> 01:41:42.333
Where was he?

01:41:42.335 --> 01:41:45.403
I've seen his records of entry
and exit to the States,

01:41:45.405 --> 01:41:48.341
and spoken to his CO.

01:41:48.343 --> 01:41:51.813
He wasn't in the country,
Dixon. He ain't our guy.

01:41:53.013 --> 01:41:54.281
No, he

01:41:56.551 --> 01:41:57.916
might not be our guy,

01:41:57.918 --> 01:41:59.685
but he still done
something shitty.

01:41:59.687 --> 01:42:00.886
I know he did.

01:42:00.888 --> 01:42:02.757
Not in Missouri
he didn't.

01:42:03.391 --> 01:42:04.590
Where was he?

01:42:04.592 --> 01:42:07.193
That's
classified information.

01:42:07.195 --> 01:42:09.060
Oh, come on, man.

01:42:09.062 --> 01:42:11.730
If the guy
has a commanding officer,

01:42:11.732 --> 01:42:13.466
and if the guy
got back to the country

01:42:13.468 --> 01:42:14.667
nine months ago,

01:42:14.669 --> 01:42:17.769
and if the country
where he was is classified,

01:42:17.771 --> 01:42:20.140
which country
do you think he was in?

01:42:21.476 --> 01:42:23.178
Hey, you know...

01:42:25.346 --> 01:42:26.781
I'll give you a clue.

01:42:28.516 --> 01:42:30.118
It was sandy.

01:42:34.054 --> 01:42:36.324
That doesn't really
narrow it down.

01:42:38.593 --> 01:42:40.591
All you need
to know is that

01:42:40.593 --> 01:42:42.661
he didn't do nothing
to Angela Hayes.

01:42:42.663 --> 01:42:45.200
So, we're gonna
keep looking.

01:42:51.239 --> 01:42:52.307
All right?

01:43:03.383 --> 01:43:05.319
I found my badge
after all.

01:44:13.087 --> 01:44:14.155
Hello?

01:44:14.755 --> 01:44:16.057
<i>It's Dixon.</i>

01:44:21.294 --> 01:44:22.730
Tell me.

01:44:25.432 --> 01:44:27.198
He weren't the guy.

01:44:43.017 --> 01:44:44.285
Mildred?

01:44:54.562 --> 01:44:56.030
Are you sure?

01:44:57.632 --> 01:45:01.469
He... He weren't even in
the country when it happened.

01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:08.142
So, whatever he did,
he didn't do it round here.

01:45:09.610 --> 01:45:12.176
<i>I'm sorry I got
your hopes up.</i>

01:45:12.178 --> 01:45:14.248
That's all right.
That's all right.

01:45:17.017 --> 01:45:18.283
At least I had
a day of hoping,

01:45:18.285 --> 01:45:20.822
and that's more
than I've had for a while.

01:45:27.495 --> 01:45:28.797
I gotta go.

01:45:32.566 --> 01:45:34.002
There was, uh...

01:45:35.536 --> 01:45:37.806
There was one thing
I was thinking.

01:45:40.441 --> 01:45:41.810
<i>What's that?</i>

01:45:42.576 --> 01:45:44.445
I know he ain't
your rapist.

01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:49.884
He is a rapist, though.
I'm sure of that.

01:45:58.090 --> 01:45:59.828
What are you
saying to me?

01:46:01.962 --> 01:46:03.598
Got his license plate.

01:46:06.734 --> 01:46:08.468
I know where he lives.

01:46:11.472 --> 01:46:12.907
Where's he live?

01:46:14.807 --> 01:46:16.310
He lives in Idaho.

01:46:22.616 --> 01:46:23.951
That's funny.

01:46:27.087 --> 01:46:29.357
I'm driving to Idaho
in the morning.

01:46:34.928 --> 01:46:36.431
Want some company?

01:46:42.169 --> 01:46:43.237
Sure.

01:49:25.266 --> 01:49:27.502
- Hey, Dixon?
- Yeah?

01:49:28.835 --> 01:49:30.237
I need to tell you
something.

01:49:32.539 --> 01:49:35.343
It was me that burned down
the police station.

01:49:37.611 --> 01:49:40.281
Why, who the hell else
would it have been?

01:49:52.359 --> 01:49:53.628
Dixon?

01:49:54.328 --> 01:49:55.827
Yeah?

01:49:55.829 --> 01:49:57.729
