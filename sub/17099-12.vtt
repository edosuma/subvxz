00:45.459 --> 00:48.699
Ya! Take that! Ya!

00:48.699 --> 00:51.579
Hi ya! Ya! That!

01:16.066 --> 01:18.318
Get out!

01:23.957 --> 01:27.066
Does he take me a fool?

01:27.721 --> 01:31.091
He's much too old and
all he did was spout

01:31.211 --> 01:33.740
details from the advertisement.

01:33.860 --> 01:39.120
And Adam's eyes were beautiful
brown, not his cold blue ones.

01:39.126 --> 01:41.734
Grandmother, you can't keep
putting yourself through this.

01:41.746 --> 01:43.570
I'll put myself through whatever I want.

01:43.586 --> 01:47.210
- It's been twenty years.
- I know exactly how long it's been,

01:47.237 --> 01:48.689
but that doesn't change the fact

01:48.694 --> 01:50.985
that my grandson was stolen from me.

01:54.662 --> 01:57.740
- I will see the next one in.
- Thank you.

02:01.601 --> 02:04.710
Let it be him.

02:09.350 --> 02:12.238
_

02:15.642 --> 02:17.585
Mrs. Adelia Gordon?

02:17.705 --> 02:19.064
Yes.

02:19.262 --> 02:20.693
I...

02:21.435 --> 02:24.555
I felt the need to respond
to your advertisement.

02:25.195 --> 02:27.636
You believe you are my grandson?

02:27.652 --> 02:30.311
I have memories,

02:30.431 --> 02:33.337
recollections that were
never part of my life.

02:33.457 --> 02:35.080
Do you now?

02:39.140 --> 02:41.350
Do you know these faces?

02:41.388 --> 02:43.125
Were they part of your life?

02:43.917 --> 02:46.197
- I don't know.
- You should.

02:46.751 --> 02:49.916
That was my son and his wife.

02:49.950 --> 02:51.554
And if you are Adam Gordon,

02:51.581 --> 02:53.377
those were your parents.

02:53.856 --> 02:55.529
Do you recognize them?

02:56.094 --> 02:58.390
Perhaps I shouldn't be here after all.

02:59.514 --> 03:03.795
If you are Adam, you grew up here.

03:04.688 --> 03:06.721
Are you familiar with this house?

03:09.522 --> 03:11.964
Why are you here?

03:12.018 --> 03:14.777
Why must you torture my
grandmother like this?

03:14.804 --> 03:16.961
Oh, right. Because of this.

03:23.582 --> 03:25.422
It's... it's...

03:25.542 --> 03:27.530
It is our family crest.

03:27.584 --> 03:30.848
- Where did you get that?
- I've had it since I was a child.

03:31.720 --> 03:34.975
My Adam was wearing that
when he was taken from me.

03:35.236 --> 03:36.812
Where did you find it?

03:36.932 --> 03:38.372
I've always had it.

03:39.313 --> 03:42.749
I am most interested in finding
a particular blonde woman.

03:42.782 --> 03:46.012
- The one Miss Sykes was last seen with.
- As was Miss Clark.

03:46.039 --> 03:48.681
You think this woman has something
to do with their disappearances?

03:48.734 --> 03:50.589
Who knows anything with certainty? But

03:50.632 --> 03:52.955
this woman appears to be
linked to the two of them.

03:53.075 --> 03:56.377
It could be coincidence,
it could be more.

03:56.950 --> 03:59.261
You know the tiresome thing about

03:59.286 --> 04:01.829
- working with other people?
- What's that, sir?

04:01.835 --> 04:04.067
Always having to ask permission.

04:05.782 --> 04:07.765
Oh, Inspector.

04:08.155 --> 04:10.628
- Please call me Detective.
- Of course.

04:10.662 --> 04:13.523
I would like to commandeer
Constable Jackson again.

04:13.561 --> 04:16.991
- He's an agreeable fellow.
- Oh. Why, thank you.

04:16.997 --> 04:20.392
I need to talk to Detective
William Murdoch. Now!

04:22.172 --> 04:24.446
- Can I help you?
- You have to stop her.

04:24.473 --> 04:27.701
My grandmother is about to sign
away her fortune to an imposter.

04:32.165 --> 04:35.381
My grandmother is Mrs. Adelia Gordon.

04:35.794 --> 04:38.311
- You've heard of her?
- I have, Mr. Foster.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.753
Then I imagine you know
she is quite wealthy,

04:41.947 --> 04:43.781
which makes her a target

04:43.802 --> 04:46.733
for all manner of confidence trickster.

04:47.411 --> 04:49.530
Considering the newspaper advertisement

04:49.557 --> 04:51.757
she places each year,
I can certainly see why.

04:51.779 --> 04:54.177
And the moment it appears,
our family is faced

04:54.199 --> 04:57.345
with a steady trail of
charlatans and fraudsters

04:57.356 --> 04:59.523
all claiming to be my
missing step-brother.

04:59.561 --> 05:01.045
Of course, they are not

05:01.165 --> 05:03.444
and then her hopes are
dashed all over again.

05:03.564 --> 05:04.869
Until today,

05:05.149 --> 05:07.225
when "her Adam" walked through the door.

05:07.263 --> 05:09.296
You don't believe this
man to be Adam Gordon.

05:09.318 --> 05:12.265
Of course not. Adam is
dead. He has been for years.

05:12.281 --> 05:13.959
I was there when he was kidnapped.

05:14.079 --> 05:17.235
And that was the last day
that Adam was ever seen alive.

05:28.487 --> 05:30.014
You should go and see her, George.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.826
Why should I? It's clear she
wants nothing to do with me.

05:32.859 --> 05:34.864
- That's not true.
- It is.

05:34.984 --> 05:37.214
Miss Bloom thinks I'm too good for her.

05:37.429 --> 05:39.951
- Well, she's wrong about that.
- I agree with you there.

05:40.021 --> 05:41.586
So go and tell her!

05:41.591 --> 05:43.237
I think it's just best
for both of us if I let

05:43.248 --> 05:45.136
- our association come to an end.
- George...

05:45.163 --> 05:46.813
Higgins, it's what she wants. That's...

05:47.071 --> 05:49.379
That's all I have to say on it.

05:53.590 --> 05:54.666
George,

05:55.064 --> 05:58.657
could you see if you could find
any files on an Adam Gordon?

05:58.673 --> 06:01.512
- A young boy who was kidnapped...
- Has the boy been found, then?

06:01.797 --> 06:04.471
- You're familiar with the case?
- Yes, of course, sir.

06:04.691 --> 06:06.503
He was in the care of his grandmother.

06:06.573 --> 06:09.316
She receives a ransom
note demanding 500$,

06:09.343 --> 06:11.064
with instructions on where to leave it.

06:11.085 --> 06:12.747
She provided the ransom, sir,

06:12.769 --> 06:14.484
but the money was never collected

06:14.522 --> 06:15.979
and the boy was never found.

06:16.253 --> 06:18.130
It's long been suspected that...

06:18.384 --> 06:20.121
that the kidnaper killed him.

06:20.659 --> 06:22.084
Constable Crabtree!

06:22.106 --> 06:23.477
Ah, Miss Cherry.

06:23.929 --> 06:26.123
Detective Murdoch, I heard a rumour

06:26.134 --> 06:28.763
that Mrs. Gordon had recently
located her long-lost grandson.

06:28.883 --> 06:32.329
- Is this true?
- I would say: Don't believe every rumour you hear.

06:32.674 --> 06:34.486
Is he who he says he is?

06:34.654 --> 06:36.858
That is something I can't answer.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.257
Mrs. Gordon has been
looking for her grandson

06:39.278 --> 06:40.623
for almost twenty years.

06:40.913 --> 06:43.108
- Now it appears he's come home.
- Exactly.

06:43.183 --> 06:45.587
He "appears" to have
come home. Thank you.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.621
I'm not at liberty to say anything.

06:49.911 --> 06:51.441
Of course, Constable Crabtree,

06:51.445 --> 06:53.381
I'd never put you in that position.

06:54.478 --> 06:56.350
I must say you're looking well.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.652
As are you.

06:59.043 --> 07:03.244
- I heard another rumour...
- I can neither confirm or deny anything.

07:04.293 --> 07:05.751
That's a shame.

07:05.871 --> 07:08.300
I had heard a rumour that
you had recently become...

07:08.420 --> 07:09.860
unencumbered.

07:16.598 --> 07:18.571
The blonde woman's hunting grounds

07:18.593 --> 07:20.782
were the neighbourhoods
affected by the Toronto Fire.

07:20.809 --> 07:23.842
- Hunting grounds? That's a little over-dramatic, sir.
- Is it?

07:24.052 --> 07:25.485
Two missing women.

07:25.509 --> 07:27.800
We don't know how many more
she came in contact with.

07:27.827 --> 07:31.296
And now they are gone. Is
that reason enough for drama?

07:32.172 --> 07:34.130
- So you think she killed them?
- _

07:34.250 --> 07:35.668
If I was a betting man...

07:35.684 --> 07:38.798
Well, I was a betting man
once and that didn't go well...

07:38.808 --> 07:42.154
- But that's what I'd suspect.
- So, what is it exactly

07:42.181 --> 07:44.811
- you think you're doing, sir?
- I beg your pardon?

07:44.886 --> 07:47.677
You're hoping someone will recognize
this womanfrom this drawing.

07:47.797 --> 07:51.008
- I would call that a bet.
- I suppose it is.

07:51.270 --> 07:54.948
I must say you demonstrate
an unexpected wit, Jackson.

07:55.621 --> 07:57.853
I'm sorry, sir.

07:58.276 --> 08:00.132
You have a strong heart.

08:00.179 --> 08:02.135
One that is open for love.

08:02.162 --> 08:05.731
Alas, a big heart means the
corresponding hurt is large.

08:05.751 --> 08:08.238
However, see that star

08:08.252 --> 08:10.006
at the top of your line of life?

08:10.222 --> 08:13.226
- Mmm-hmm.
- That's the symbol of happiness.

08:13.246 --> 08:15.989
It signifies a great joy lies ahead.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.333
You do this for a living?

08:19.408 --> 08:21.785
I read palms, did sleight of hand,

08:21.807 --> 08:23.199
anything to earn a penny.

08:23.253 --> 08:26.808
Oh! My husband would
be rolling in his grave.

08:26.824 --> 08:28.503
Why do you say that?

08:28.514 --> 08:30.229
A Gordon, an entertainer?

08:30.288 --> 08:32.686
The entire family would be scandalized.

08:32.724 --> 08:35.176
We don't know that he's
a Gordon yet, Grandmother.

08:36.327 --> 08:37.616
Who is that?

08:37.988 --> 08:40.645
Detective William Murdoch.
Toronto Constabulary.

08:40.660 --> 08:44.341
- You are not needed here.
- Mrs. Gordon,

08:44.373 --> 08:45.997
it may be in your best interest

08:46.045 --> 08:48.756
if I can ask this man some questions.

08:48.876 --> 08:52.015
- That is not necessary.
- I don't mind.

08:52.135 --> 08:53.897
What would you like to know?

08:54.193 --> 08:57.688
- Is there somewhere private...
- Before you get started, Detective,

08:57.699 --> 08:59.323
I also have a question.

08:59.443 --> 09:03.255
It might save us all a lot of
time and you a lot of bother.

09:08.438 --> 09:12.495
I kept Adam's room exactly
the way it was since he left.

09:13.883 --> 09:17.352
- Do you remember this place?
- I don't. No.

09:17.417 --> 09:20.504
These are all your things.
Your favourite things.

09:20.547 --> 09:22.494
All of these toys here belonged to Adam

09:22.532 --> 09:25.092
but he only ever played with one.

09:25.371 --> 09:26.796
Which is it?

09:36.181 --> 09:37.902
No. Adam hated that.

09:37.924 --> 09:40.161
What did I tell you, Detective?
This man is wasting our time.

09:40.177 --> 09:41.790
Let him think.

09:42.011 --> 09:43.694
It was a long time ago.

10:09.015 --> 10:10.628
I remember these.

10:12.129 --> 10:14.205
I played with them by the hour.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.567
Those were Adam's favourite toys.

10:18.210 --> 10:20.309
That may be so, Mrs. Gordon,

10:20.341 --> 10:22.659
but it doesn't make
this man your grandson.

10:22.912 --> 10:24.746
I didn't say it did.

10:27.854 --> 10:30.124
With your permission, I'd like Dr. Ogden

10:30.172 --> 10:31.441
to take a look at him.

10:31.678 --> 10:34.076
Perhaps she can shed some light.

10:34.136 --> 10:36.136
- How so?
- She may be able

10:36.153 --> 10:39.014
to provide medical evidence
that he is indeed your grandson.

10:39.933 --> 10:42.918
Do you still have the ransom
note that was left, Mr. Foster?

10:42.940 --> 10:45.493
Yes, of course. Our family
has an extensive file

10:45.536 --> 10:48.749
on every scrap of evidence
relating to the case, that included.

10:49.041 --> 10:50.987
- I'll need to see it.
- Very well.

10:53.469 --> 10:55.462
Could you stand over here, please?

10:59.339 --> 11:00.832
What are you doing?

11:01.172 --> 11:03.409
I'm going to compare
your physical features

11:03.426 --> 11:05.186
with those of the Gordon family.

11:05.487 --> 11:08.774
See if I can note any
familial similarities.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.817
Adam Gordon was three feet eleven inches

11:12.818 --> 11:14.642
at the time of his disappearance.

11:14.827 --> 11:16.121
So given that,

11:16.147 --> 11:19.283
I can estimate what his likely
height would have been at adulthood.

11:19.403 --> 11:20.613
I see.

11:21.667 --> 11:23.634
Now if you'll excuse me.

11:31.456 --> 11:32.949
I see that your right leg

11:33.246 --> 11:34.773
is shorter than your left.

11:35.466 --> 11:36.804
Almost one inch.

11:37.070 --> 11:39.067
There is no record that
Adam had that imbalance.

11:39.084 --> 11:42.118
Oh, uh, when I was 7 years old,

11:42.148 --> 11:45.349
a horse kicked me and broke my leg.

11:45.668 --> 11:47.703
My foster parents couldn't afford

11:47.733 --> 11:50.336
to have it set properly,
hence what you see.

11:51.045 --> 11:52.233
I see.

11:53.673 --> 11:55.841
Well, you best be him

11:55.961 --> 11:58.594
because if you're not, you'll
be breaking an old woman's heart.

11:58.620 --> 12:01.108
I know that, ma'am. And believe me,

12:01.121 --> 12:03.108
that's the last thing I want to do.

12:03.904 --> 12:05.293
Pen and ink.

12:05.349 --> 12:08.132
Not very good ink. Several blots.

12:08.451 --> 12:11.157
Looks like an ordinary
piece of school paper.

12:12.203 --> 12:13.829
Not very good penmanship,

12:13.859 --> 12:15.739
although the letter is sophisticated.

12:15.752 --> 12:17.826
Good grammar. No spelling mistakes.

12:18.140 --> 12:19.956
The kidnapper had
something of an education.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.446
Over the years, sir,
reports kept trickling in.

12:23.450 --> 12:26.057
One person even claimed they'd
seen the boy in South Africa.

12:26.285 --> 12:28.268
The frequency of the
reports of course went up

12:28.277 --> 12:30.583
each time Mrs. Gordon
placed her advertisement.

12:30.953 --> 12:32.730
People looking to get their hands

12:32.743 --> 12:34.602
on their share of that reward money.

12:34.821 --> 12:37.098
We're not always the most
noble of species, are we, sir?

12:37.115 --> 12:40.563
This is true. A fact that
keeps you and me employed.

12:40.913 --> 12:42.446
That said, sir,

12:43.258 --> 12:45.980
when the advertisements first
began showing up in the newspaper,

12:46.012 --> 12:48.125
I have to admit, as an orphan,

12:49.755 --> 12:52.176
I was somewhat tempted
to respond to them myself.

12:52.296 --> 12:54.188
I mean, I had a fine upbringing, but

12:54.231 --> 12:57.226
the thought of not only being
reunited with a loving family, but

12:57.640 --> 12:59.184
being made lord of a manor,

12:59.195 --> 13:01.470
having servants waiting
on you hand and foot...

13:04.105 --> 13:05.751
Well, this is interesting.

13:06.982 --> 13:08.859
And you've never seen this note before?

13:08.880 --> 13:10.435
No, I have not.

13:11.151 --> 13:14.565
It seems a neighbour, Mr.
Wilkes, saw a strange man

13:14.592 --> 13:16.582
burying something in this area

13:16.598 --> 13:18.728
three days after your
brother was kidnapped.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.523
And he was never questioned?

13:20.534 --> 13:22.911
There's no mention of
it in the police files.

13:23.572 --> 13:25.568
So how did you come to have it?

13:25.600 --> 13:28.402
I don't know. I was fifteen
when I started collecting

13:28.402 --> 13:29.671
information about my missing brother.

13:29.704 --> 13:32.172
I can't be expected to remember
where every piece of it came from.

13:32.242 --> 13:34.737
This Mr. Wilkes, was he ever spoken to?

13:34.753 --> 13:36.792
- He died three years ago.
- Sir.

13:38.804 --> 13:40.186
This could be it.

13:45.946 --> 13:49.120
George, maybe this
isn't the right place.

13:49.155 --> 13:52.689
Or it could be a prank. Our family
has had more than our fair share.

13:54.227 --> 13:55.874
Sir.

13:56.991 --> 13:59.512
It may not be a prank.

14:03.936 --> 14:05.723
Bones.

14:06.101 --> 14:08.799
Small but human.

14:14.252 --> 14:16.269
A button with an anchor.

14:17.302 --> 14:20.512
Possibly from a sailor's outfit.

14:29.107 --> 14:31.712
- If it's my brother, then...
- Mr. Foster.

14:31.721 --> 14:34.855
Dear God. You found him.

14:36.082 --> 14:37.771
Where are you going?

14:38.166 --> 14:39.550
I'm going to kill that bastard

14:39.555 --> 14:41.470
that's trying to worm
his way into my family.

14:41.475 --> 14:44.061
It might be best if
you let us handle this.

14:44.181 --> 14:45.809
Then you'd better.

14:53.592 --> 14:57.915
Do you know for certain that
this is the body of my Adam?

14:58.426 --> 15:00.932
The body is roughly the same age.

15:00.954 --> 15:04.234
And we found remnants of a
sailor suit with the remains.

15:04.627 --> 15:07.246
But you are not sure that it is him.

15:07.633 --> 15:09.531
Doctor Ogden is performing some tests

15:09.537 --> 15:11.903
that may give us confirmation.

15:12.882 --> 15:14.727
I should have known.

15:15.308 --> 15:19.007
I'm much too old to believe in miracles.

15:19.608 --> 15:22.304
I always hoped that one day my grandson

15:22.325 --> 15:24.272
would come through that door.

15:24.950 --> 15:28.453
Instead, all that ever came were cheats.

15:29.868 --> 15:31.179
He...

15:31.513 --> 15:33.272
seemed different.

15:34.412 --> 15:37.467
He seemed like he might be the one.

15:38.026 --> 15:40.054
So who are you?

15:40.312 --> 15:44.292
I thought I might be Adam Gordon.

15:44.981 --> 15:47.562
And before that what name did you go by?

15:47.858 --> 15:50.348
My given name was Albert Slaight.

15:50.424 --> 15:52.875
And is Albert Slaight the type of man

15:52.886 --> 15:55.222
who would deliberately
deceive an old woman?

15:55.256 --> 15:57.421
I didn't mean to do
that. I sincerely thought

15:57.459 --> 15:59.426
I might be her long-lost grandson.

16:00.153 --> 16:02.329
Tell me about the couple who raised you.

16:03.584 --> 16:05.526
They were entertainers.

16:05.734 --> 16:08.280
We were itinerant.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.572
How did you come to be in
possession of the Gordon family pin?

16:11.599 --> 16:13.173
I've always had it.

16:13.293 --> 16:15.509
Ever since I was a small child.

16:15.874 --> 16:18.364
Did they say how it was that they

16:18.402 --> 16:20.209
stumbled upon you?

16:20.247 --> 16:23.291
They said I was rescued
from dire circumstances.

16:23.684 --> 16:25.313
Nothing more than that?

16:25.545 --> 16:26.932
Occasionally,

16:27.588 --> 16:30.418
they would refer to
me as a little prince.

16:34.204 --> 16:35.290
Anything?

16:35.483 --> 16:38.414
I've shown her likeness at
every church in the area.

16:38.425 --> 16:41.469
- And?
- Toronto has a lot of churches.

16:41.523 --> 16:44.733
More than 170. And you found nothing?

16:45.233 --> 16:46.717
No, sir.

16:48.605 --> 16:52.303
- What the devil is that?
- A pretzel. German.

16:52.423 --> 16:54.548
First came across them in New York City.

16:54.582 --> 16:55.865
- Interested?
- No.

16:55.875 --> 16:57.938
Are you sure? They really
are quite delicious.

16:57.941 --> 17:00.043
I'm not interested in anything unusual.

17:00.259 --> 17:01.480
Your loss.

17:01.824 --> 17:03.664
We begin again tomorrow.

17:04.071 --> 17:06.056
Someone has seen this woman,

17:06.336 --> 17:09.546
therefore someone knows
something about her and someone

17:09.830 --> 17:11.364
is going to tell me.

17:11.832 --> 17:13.472
- Something.
- Something. Right.

17:15.579 --> 17:18.586
- Sir, I may have something.
- What have you?

17:18.705 --> 17:20.582
Well, for some time,
sir, there was a man

17:20.625 --> 17:23.260
by the name of Irving Moses
who was a squatter, sir.

17:23.380 --> 17:26.847
And he stayed on the land near
where the dead boy was found.

17:27.251 --> 17:28.536
So he may have witnessed

17:28.541 --> 17:30.569
- who buried the child's body.
- Well, I don't know, sir.

17:30.618 --> 17:32.312
And our original witness, Mr. Wilkes,

17:32.344 --> 17:34.006
didn't identify him as such.

17:34.038 --> 17:36.958
So we have a dead witness
and an itinerant squatter.

17:36.985 --> 17:39.819
Well, we also have
the squatter's sister.

17:40.599 --> 17:42.008
Mrs. Bergman,

17:42.056 --> 17:44.417
do you know where I might find
your brother, Irving Moses?

17:44.433 --> 17:46.966
I have no idea. What's
he done this time?

17:47.229 --> 17:49.941
We're looking into an old police matter.

17:50.061 --> 17:53.207
Do you know if your brother
was in Toronto in 1884?

17:53.243 --> 17:54.786
He may have been.

17:54.980 --> 17:57.663
He never stays put in one
place long. What's this about?

17:58.158 --> 18:01.019
A young boy disappeared
about twenty years ago,

18:01.068 --> 18:02.831
it was rather notorious.

18:02.951 --> 18:05.552
Has he ever spoken to
you about this case?

18:05.587 --> 18:07.941
Irving would never hurt
a child. I know that.

18:08.061 --> 18:09.226
I see.

18:09.452 --> 18:11.172
When did you last hear from him?

18:11.436 --> 18:13.652
He wrote a letter, he said
he was coming to visit,

18:13.663 --> 18:15.368
bringing some good news.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.283
Due to arrive on the
Chatham train three days ago.

18:18.326 --> 18:21.284
- Of course, he never did.
- And what was this good news?

18:21.404 --> 18:24.339
I don't know. Maybe he
won at cards or something.

18:24.602 --> 18:25.980
All right then.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.739
- If you happen to hear from him...
- I'll let him know you're looking for him.

18:29.572 --> 18:33.167
Perhaps it would be best
if you spoke to me first.

18:33.356 --> 18:35.645
You expect me to turn in
my own flesh and blood?

18:35.662 --> 18:39.290
No, Mrs. Bergman, I expect
you to be an honest citizen.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.553
And one who would do the right thing.

18:42.758 --> 18:44.258
Is everything all right, Mother?

18:44.475 --> 18:47.160
It's all right. This policeman
was just asking about your uncle.

18:50.086 --> 18:52.129
Sir, if you have any
business with my family,

18:52.323 --> 18:54.517
- talk to me.
- Certainly.

18:55.614 --> 18:57.267
The train from Chatham, you say?

18:59.758 --> 19:00.841
Good day.

19:03.037 --> 19:05.253
There was an Irving Moses
on the passenger list.

19:05.257 --> 19:06.935
- Where did he get off the train?
- Not here.

19:06.944 --> 19:08.389
Only people who got
off the train here were

19:08.402 --> 19:10.411
- a woman and her two daughters.
- Are you sure?

19:12.227 --> 19:13.827
The daughters were both red headed.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.921
The mother appeared young
to have children of that age.

19:15.938 --> 19:17.483
They traveled with four bags.

19:18.210 --> 19:20.038
Could he have disembarked
somewhere else?

19:20.094 --> 19:21.360
He could have done anything.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.982
Please have a crew check the
line between Chatham and Toronto.

19:25.141 --> 19:28.596
Nothing exhaustive. I just
need to rule some things out.

19:33.019 --> 19:36.586
William, this is not Adam Gordon's body.

19:37.270 --> 19:39.767
- Are you sure?
- Miss James.

19:39.925 --> 19:40.885
Look.

19:41.005 --> 19:42.976
The youngster suffered from rickets.

19:43.051 --> 19:45.751
Not something you would normally
find in a child of his station.

19:45.786 --> 19:47.258
No, not at all.

19:48.221 --> 19:49.353
Anything else?

19:49.473 --> 19:51.558
It's hard to get much
more from the bones.

19:51.678 --> 19:53.509
We can't even determine
the colour of his hair

19:53.561 --> 19:55.923
- because there isn't any.
- That's odd.

19:56.043 --> 19:57.898
Hair usually remains.

19:58.229 --> 19:59.851
Perhaps it had been shaved off.

19:59.932 --> 20:03.331
Didn't they used to shave
children's heads in orphanages

20:03.349 --> 20:05.655
- as a matter of course?
- Yes, I believe they did.

20:05.681 --> 20:06.536
Hmm.

20:07.582 --> 20:08.744
How did he die?

20:08.864 --> 20:10.099
Consumption.

20:11.493 --> 20:13.756
See where the bacillus
ate into his sternum?

20:14.182 --> 20:15.549
It left holes.

20:15.731 --> 20:17.611
It's definitely not Adam Gordon.

20:17.646 --> 20:21.354
So the young man claiming to be
Mrs. Gordon's long-lost grandson...

20:21.384 --> 20:23.169
May very well be telling the truth.

20:26.212 --> 20:27.728
Thank you, ladies.

20:33.101 --> 20:34.851
We're finished, Miss James.

20:35.316 --> 20:37.373
I wonder who the poor child was.

20:38.035 --> 20:39.639
I doubt we'll ever know.

20:40.182 --> 20:41.838
So what are we to do with the remains?

20:41.855 --> 20:44.076
We'll take him to the
Necropolis cemetery.

20:44.149 --> 20:46.279
He'll be buried in an unmarked grave.

20:53.219 --> 20:56.072
And you're absolutely sure
that the body you found

20:56.089 --> 20:58.885
- is not my grandson?
- The coroner has proven it.

20:58.933 --> 21:02.530
- Oh, thank God. Who was he?
- We don't know.

21:02.563 --> 21:04.569
- A pauper.
- What have you found out

21:04.590 --> 21:06.781
about the man who
claims to be my grandson?

21:06.785 --> 21:08.683
I've found nothing to prove or disprove

21:08.695 --> 21:10.067
that he's your grandson.

21:10.187 --> 21:12.313
So he is Adam.

21:12.707 --> 21:13.979
I can't say.

21:14.362 --> 21:15.481
But I can.

21:15.507 --> 21:17.783
Grandmother, you're being ridiculous.

21:17.809 --> 21:20.287
Don't tell me what I am or am not.

21:20.304 --> 21:23.683
- This is my decision.
- A rash and misguided one.

21:23.914 --> 21:27.158
Don't worry, Jonah. I have no
intention of disinheriting you,

21:27.158 --> 21:28.622
if that's what you're afraid of.

21:28.656 --> 21:31.224
How could you even suggest such a thing?

21:31.258 --> 21:33.237
This is not about money.

21:33.357 --> 21:34.923
I'm trying to protect you.

21:43.072 --> 21:45.468
This must be quite a shock for him.

21:45.877 --> 21:47.974
I should try to be kinder.

21:48.717 --> 21:50.197
He may be right.

21:50.438 --> 21:54.014
- Mr. Slaight may not be your grandson.
- Indeed.

21:54.048 --> 21:57.369
But he also may be the miracle
I have been waiting for.

22:03.005 --> 22:06.361
But there's no medical evidence
that he is your grandson.

22:06.367 --> 22:09.122
But you said you found some similarities

22:09.148 --> 22:12.194
- in bone structure with his parents.
- Some, yes.

22:12.228 --> 22:14.891
But in itself that is also not proof.

22:15.984 --> 22:18.264
How could you say he has no memory?

22:18.497 --> 22:20.790
He remembered his favourite toy.

22:20.794 --> 22:23.699
Not one single person
has ever done that.

22:25.059 --> 22:27.201
What do you think of the charcoal, Adam?

22:27.915 --> 22:30.468
Or perhaps a brown pinstripe.

22:30.544 --> 22:33.969
- Oh, let's just take both.
- Just one suit

22:33.991 --> 22:35.523
will be more than enough, grandmother.

22:35.549 --> 22:37.416
This is all a bit rich for my blood.

22:37.438 --> 22:38.910
Nonsense!

22:39.176 --> 22:41.792
I want to make up for lost time.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.191
They went out in a boat.

22:48.948 --> 22:50.407
They never came back.

22:50.712 --> 22:51.775
Adam?

22:53.423 --> 22:55.135
That's how my parents died.

22:55.427 --> 22:57.049
That's how I ended up here.

22:57.445 --> 22:59.164
My God, I remember.

22:59.643 --> 23:01.145
You took me in.

23:01.326 --> 23:04.286
- You treated me like I was your own child.
- Yes.

23:04.475 --> 23:08.567
Ha! Ha! Ha! Oh, my grandson.

23:33.577 --> 23:35.133
He'd rolled off into the clearing.

23:35.167 --> 23:37.311
We were damn lucky we spotted
him before the wolves did.

23:40.383 --> 23:41.996
There he is.

23:52.253 --> 23:54.666
Looks to have been dead
about three or four days.

23:55.380 --> 23:57.140
That the man you've been looking for?

23:58.125 --> 24:00.771
His sister said he
was bringing good news.

24:01.739 --> 24:03.624
Looks like he won't be delivering it.

24:03.963 --> 24:05.689
He wasn't in very good health.

24:06.068 --> 24:08.842
His liver was diseased but
that isn't the cause of death.

24:09.019 --> 24:10.899
He suffered severe lacerations

24:10.925 --> 24:13.004
and bruising in his fall from the train.

24:13.030 --> 24:14.471
And his neck was broken.

24:14.591 --> 24:16.520
- He was drunk?
- Very.

24:16.907 --> 24:18.843
Likely the cause of the fall, then.

24:18.878 --> 24:22.280
Or not. I found these
fibers under his fingernails.

24:22.853 --> 24:24.849
He may have reached out to grab someone.

24:25.817 --> 24:27.852
As if he was pushed from the train?

24:28.037 --> 24:30.365
- It's possible.
- Hmm.

24:32.937 --> 24:34.754
William,

24:34.874 --> 24:36.496
I witnessed something curious

24:36.501 --> 24:38.626
- at the Gordon house today.
- Go on.

24:39.009 --> 24:42.530
Mr. Gordon remembered the
circumstances of his parent's death.

24:42.874 --> 24:44.006
Which were?

24:44.381 --> 24:48.141
Peter and Rachel Gordon rented
a boat to cross Lake Ontario.

24:48.696 --> 24:52.224
A storm came up and even though
Peter was an experienced sailor,

24:52.244 --> 24:53.546
they both perished.

24:53.666 --> 24:56.712
The story's true. I looked
it up in the records.

24:57.306 --> 25:00.485
If you were able to find that
out, he could have as well.

25:00.868 --> 25:04.205
Yes, or he truly is who he says he is.

25:13.077 --> 25:14.744
Don't be so down in the mouth.

25:14.986 --> 25:16.675
Like you said, someone's seen her.

25:16.944 --> 25:20.661
Unfortunately, that someone
may have reason not to tell us.

25:21.193 --> 25:23.376
The lack of community
you were going on about.

25:23.425 --> 25:26.032
People care less and less about
what happens to each other.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.654
Not the woman were are looking
for. She was noted being

25:28.663 --> 25:30.367
- helpful to people in peril.
- No,

25:30.393 --> 25:32.816
she was noted being
around people in peril.

25:32.820 --> 25:34.649
Not necessarily being helpful to them.

25:39.076 --> 25:40.732
You the two looking for her?

25:41.111 --> 25:42.410
Indeed we are.

25:42.798 --> 25:45.091
- And you are?
- Norman Bruce.

25:45.392 --> 25:47.857
She's my wife, Muriel.

25:49.626 --> 25:52.923
- You have no idea of her whereabouts?
- I don't.

25:53.394 --> 25:55.063
And that's lucky for her.

25:57.064 --> 26:00.081
- Should I?
- We'll talk to him later.

26:01.539 --> 26:03.809
Loss takes many forms.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.506
At first, you can't believe it's true.

26:06.918 --> 26:10.215
You spend weeks or
months hoping it isn't...

26:11.661 --> 26:14.082
You sound like you know
what you're talking about.

26:15.308 --> 26:18.389
When I was 12 years of
age, my sister went missing.

26:19.314 --> 26:21.115
I haven't seen her since.

26:21.707 --> 26:23.503
She was sixteen.

26:24.831 --> 26:27.467
- Maybe she left of her own accord.
- She did not!

26:27.687 --> 26:29.419
She was taken from me.

26:29.429 --> 26:31.704
I don't know if she is alive or dead.

26:32.602 --> 26:34.883
She's still part of me and yet...

26:35.060 --> 26:36.878
not of me.

26:38.973 --> 26:41.207
These women need to be found, Jackson.

26:41.327 --> 26:44.273
The people who care about them
need to know what happened.

26:50.559 --> 26:52.296
I shouldn't even care.

26:52.522 --> 26:54.442
Irving was never here when he was needed

26:54.442 --> 26:56.206
but he was still family.

26:57.825 --> 26:59.708
And you say he fell from a train?

27:00.374 --> 27:02.493
I can't say for certain.

27:05.327 --> 27:08.669
- Was he drunk?
- It would appear that way.

27:10.321 --> 27:12.144
He could never overcome that.

27:12.477 --> 27:15.548
- What are you doing back here?
- Saul, it's all right.

27:15.763 --> 27:19.006
- The Detective just came to deliver news.
- What news?

27:19.387 --> 27:21.238
Your uncle's dead.

27:22.739 --> 27:24.352
What happened to him?

27:25.272 --> 27:27.483
I'm endeavouring to find out.

27:30.506 --> 27:32.302
Thank you for seeing me.

27:32.893 --> 27:36.690
Why are you so interested in
a child who died 20 years ago?

27:36.810 --> 27:38.426
I work for the City Coroner.

27:38.491 --> 27:40.153
His remains are in the morgue.

27:40.185 --> 27:42.174
I want to find out who he was.

27:46.019 --> 27:47.810
Why are they staring at me?

27:48.208 --> 27:50.620
Because they think you may be
here to take one of them home.

27:54.948 --> 27:57.672
Three children died in
this facility in 1884.

27:57.851 --> 27:59.956
Two of them are buried in our cemetery.

28:00.076 --> 28:01.096
And the third?

28:01.458 --> 28:02.959
A relative claimed the body.

28:03.011 --> 28:04.324
He said he was an uncle.

28:04.703 --> 28:06.419
You just let him take the remains?

28:06.634 --> 28:08.738
I didn't let him do anything.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.934
I wasn't in the employ of
this institution at the time.

28:12.657 --> 28:15.049
Do you have the name of the man
who said he was the boy's uncle?

28:16.318 --> 28:17.617
Are you quite sure?

28:17.656 --> 28:20.435
Mrs. Waters' records from the
St. Jude Orphanage confirm it.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.623
Irving Moses was a squatter on land

28:23.645 --> 28:25.263
near the Gordon Estate.

28:25.306 --> 28:27.048
Around the time of the abduction,

28:27.087 --> 28:29.940
someone saw a man burying something

28:30.323 --> 28:32.620
close to where we found the boy's body.

28:32.646 --> 28:33.622
Johnny Scott.

28:34.190 --> 28:36.884
- His name was Johnny Scott.
- Yes, Miss James.

28:37.778 --> 28:41.813
So Irving Moses buries
the body of an orphan,

28:42.333 --> 28:44.557
but dresses it to appear

28:44.677 --> 28:47.457
like Adam Gordon. Why?

28:47.475 --> 28:49.832
To convince someone that Adam was dead

28:50.185 --> 28:51.751
when he is, in fact, alive?

28:51.958 --> 28:53.489
Very good, Miss James.

28:54.092 --> 28:56.123
And who was he trying to convince?

28:56.661 --> 28:59.045
- I don't know.
- Oh, that's a pity!

28:59.213 --> 29:01.738
I was hoping you'd be able
to solve this one for me.

29:09.608 --> 29:11.208
Thank you for coming to talk to me.

29:11.269 --> 29:12.895
Didn't have much choice.

29:13.015 --> 29:15.046
Not with that big oaf dragging me in.

29:15.085 --> 29:16.539
I didn't drag you.

29:16.621 --> 29:18.570
- But if you'd like...
- Let's stick to the question

29:18.596 --> 29:20.093
of the moment, shall we?

29:20.382 --> 29:21.797
Why did your wife leave you?

29:21.831 --> 29:23.157
Why do women do anything?

29:23.183 --> 29:25.085
I can't read their bird brains.

29:25.115 --> 29:26.875
Oh, that's why.

29:27.262 --> 29:30.244
When she left, did you
try and win her back?

29:32.356 --> 29:36.022
- You did, didn't you?
- She said she was finished with me.

29:36.052 --> 29:37.773
Doesn't seem a big surprise.

29:37.795 --> 29:39.717
What was she doing the
last time you saw her?

29:40.156 --> 29:42.040
Why are you so interested in Muriel?

29:42.230 --> 29:45.311
She's been seen in the company
of at least two missing women.

29:46.081 --> 29:48.405
- What are you suggesting?
- I'm suggesting...

29:48.525 --> 29:52.019
Well, not sure, exactly, except...

29:52.050 --> 29:53.564
to say that your wife

29:53.582 --> 29:56.369
has been seen with two people of
completely different backgrounds.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.735
And that those two people are now gone.

29:58.795 --> 30:00.460
The suggestion would be that your wife

30:00.481 --> 30:02.920
and a number of other
women have fallen off

30:02.925 --> 30:04.740
- the face of the earth.
- Her cousin.

30:05.592 --> 30:08.983
- Excuse me?
- Her cousin left her family years ago.

30:09.047 --> 30:11.047
I remember Muriel
received a letter from her.

30:11.078 --> 30:12.639
And what was this cousin's name?

30:12.832 --> 30:14.515
Caroline McGovern.

30:15.461 --> 30:17.926
She said she'd found a safe haven and

30:18.214 --> 30:20.589
- a place to live out her days.
- Safe haven?

30:20.709 --> 30:23.081
- What did she mean by that?
- I don't know.

30:23.503 --> 30:24.945
Do you have this letter now?

30:25.422 --> 30:26.451
No.

30:26.975 --> 30:29.493
And how did your wife
respond to this letter?

30:29.736 --> 30:31.666
She thought little about it.

30:32.040 --> 30:35.048
Muriel considered her
cousin flighty and impulsive.

30:36.067 --> 30:39.449
But that was back when she
still was happy with me.

30:39.767 --> 30:41.754
And where is this safe haven?

30:42.658 --> 30:44.043
I wish I knew.

30:51.418 --> 30:52.950
Why did she invite us?

30:53.595 --> 30:56.185
She thinks that Adam
Gordon is her grandson.

30:56.203 --> 30:59.111
I think she's just happy
and she wants to celebrate.

30:59.124 --> 31:00.858
A bit premature, don't you think?

31:01.362 --> 31:03.186
We haven't found anything yet.

31:03.805 --> 31:06.946
I am just so happy that
God has answered my prayers

31:06.959 --> 31:08.551
and my grandson is back.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.999
All of Toronto is happy for you.

31:11.360 --> 31:12.522
Detective Murdoch.

31:12.642 --> 31:15.568
Oh, thank you so much for coming.

31:16.049 --> 31:17.568
We're honoured to be here.

31:17.688 --> 31:20.396
I feel like my life is beginning again.

31:20.878 --> 31:23.610
Please, come. Have a drink.

31:25.459 --> 31:26.820
So Detective,

31:26.940 --> 31:28.782
is he who he says he is?

31:29.286 --> 31:31.226
Mrs. Gordon seems to think so.

31:31.346 --> 31:33.485
- But you don't.
- I didn't say that.

31:33.906 --> 31:37.025
I truly think he is Adam.

31:37.145 --> 31:40.204
Why, just yesterday,
he remembered the scent

31:40.234 --> 31:42.320
of the perfume that I used to wear.

31:43.504 --> 31:45.874
I certainly hope you're right.

31:46.218 --> 31:47.259
Where is he?

31:47.513 --> 31:50.069
Oh, he and Jonah have just
gone out grouse shooting.

31:50.108 --> 31:51.889
They should be back at any moment.

31:52.009 --> 31:54.952
An itinerant entertainer
returns home after 20 years.

31:54.978 --> 31:56.699
Settles into a life
of the landed gentry.

31:56.708 --> 31:59.234
- That's not suspicious?
- It is suspicious.

31:59.354 --> 32:01.135
But I have yet to find any proof

32:01.144 --> 32:03.136
that he isn't Adam Gordon.

32:03.630 --> 32:06.026
- And what about the dead boy you found?
- A pauper.

32:06.095 --> 32:08.556
And definitely not
the young Adam Gordon.

32:08.814 --> 32:12.756
My regret is that we missed
so much time together.

32:12.795 --> 32:15.785
All of us. Adam, Jonah, myself.

32:16.211 --> 32:19.945
I hope that the remaining
years will be happy ones.

32:20.065 --> 32:22.153
Help!

32:22.273 --> 32:25.754
What was that?

32:26.021 --> 32:28.258
Oh no!

32:30.052 --> 32:31.348
Julia!

32:31.533 --> 32:34.962
Jonah. You shot him? Your own brother?

32:35.436 --> 32:36.512
Adam!

32:43.099 --> 32:44.876
You very nearly killed him.

32:45.139 --> 32:46.843
It was an accident.

32:46.860 --> 32:48.193
So you say.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.382
Will he recover?

32:51.417 --> 32:54.416
He hasn't yet regained
consciousness after the surgery,

32:54.437 --> 32:55.943
but I believe so.

32:56.623 --> 32:58.860
What happened?

32:59.307 --> 33:01.694
We were hunting for grouse.

33:02.047 --> 33:03.044
We split up.

33:03.164 --> 33:06.049
And I distinctly remember
Adam going off to my left.

33:06.334 --> 33:08.510
Then when I heard a rustle
in the hedgerow to my right,

33:08.532 --> 33:10.012
I didn't think it would be him.

33:10.330 --> 33:12.934
He should have been nowhere near!

33:13.687 --> 33:14.784
Can I go?

33:15.313 --> 33:17.225
No, you may not.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.910
It was an accident!

33:29.552 --> 33:30.890
Constable Crabtree!

33:31.010 --> 33:33.837
Is Mr. Foster being charged
with the shooting of his brother?

33:34.069 --> 33:35.916
Miss Cherry, I don't know.

33:36.320 --> 33:39.568
Then could we have a cup of
tea while we await the decision?

33:39.585 --> 33:41.173
Well, it could take a while.

33:41.750 --> 33:44.086
I do drink very slowly.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.420
Very well.

33:49.705 --> 33:51.022
I know I shouldn't have gone through it

33:51.027 --> 33:52.795
but I thought it
belonged to the dead man.

33:53.329 --> 33:54.369
It doesn't?

33:54.412 --> 33:56.925
The dead man was very poorly dressed.

33:57.373 --> 33:59.037
But look what's in here.

34:09.143 --> 34:10.956
This case belongs to a flim flam man.

34:12.630 --> 34:14.347
Very interesting.

34:18.061 --> 34:19.795
Notice anything unusual?

34:20.195 --> 34:21.768
Looks like a couple of shoes.

34:21.976 --> 34:24.239
One heel is much higher than the other.

34:24.467 --> 34:26.333
A flim flam man indeed.

34:28.777 --> 34:30.960
You have to tell me what is going on.

34:31.007 --> 34:33.279
I need to search Mr. Slaight's room.

34:33.864 --> 34:35.860
He's going to recover, isn't he?

34:35.889 --> 34:38.304
- I believe so.
- And what about Jonah?

34:38.330 --> 34:40.744
- He's to remain in custody.
- He said it was an accident.

34:40.770 --> 34:44.143
- I'm sure it was an accident.
- Mrs. Gordon, please.

35:13.213 --> 35:14.993
I was told by the doctors

35:14.995 --> 35:18.398
that your wife's swift
actions may have saved my life.

35:18.518 --> 35:19.930
So thank you.

35:21.646 --> 35:23.212
What will you do to my brother?

35:23.332 --> 35:24.825
He'll be charged.

35:26.795 --> 35:29.041
The doctor says I'm free to go.

35:29.381 --> 35:31.450
My grandmother will be most relieved.

35:31.846 --> 35:34.109
Tell me about this little fellow.

35:37.710 --> 35:39.286
I don't know what you mean.

35:39.320 --> 35:41.483
How did it come to
be in your possession?

35:42.297 --> 35:44.397
There are dozens of them in my room.

35:44.414 --> 35:46.105
Oh yes, yes I know.

35:46.423 --> 35:48.936
But this one was found under your bed

35:49.112 --> 35:51.973
in a suitcase belonging
to an Irving Moses,

35:51.986 --> 35:53.613
who fell from a train.

35:54.421 --> 35:56.354
How did you come to have his case?

35:56.375 --> 35:58.836
I met Mr. Moses on the train to Toronto.

35:58.841 --> 36:00.497
I must have taken it by mistake.

36:00.523 --> 36:02.218
And you left yours with him.

36:03.293 --> 36:04.926
I found your shoes.

36:05.350 --> 36:08.215
I went through the contents
of that stolen case.

36:08.250 --> 36:11.955
And I found evidence that Mr.
Moses kidnapped Adam Gordon.

36:12.433 --> 36:14.811
- You found this out, didn't you?
- No, I...

36:14.820 --> 36:16.636
And based on that evidence,

36:16.756 --> 36:19.790
you knew exactly what it would
take to convince Mrs. Gordon

36:19.816 --> 36:22.823
that you were her long-lost grandson.

36:23.817 --> 36:25.888
Do you deny any of this?

36:27.084 --> 36:28.543
No.

36:31.804 --> 36:33.296
Tell me.

36:33.975 --> 36:38.088
How did it come to be that
Mr. Moses fell off that train?

36:38.208 --> 36:39.966
I have no idea.

36:40.466 --> 36:43.693
- You pushed him, didn't you?
- Of course I didn't.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.587
We found fabric under his fingernails.

36:45.587 --> 36:47.910
Fabric that matches your overcoat.

36:48.190 --> 36:51.163
Did he grab at you as you
pushed him from the train?

36:51.180 --> 36:53.608
He lost his balance.
I tried to save him.

36:54.057 --> 36:56.471
Then why not raise the alarm?

36:56.514 --> 36:58.133
Hmm?

37:02.016 --> 37:05.790
We'll continue this conversation
at the Station House, Mr. Slaight.

37:07.915 --> 37:09.675
Take him to the cells.

37:14.291 --> 37:16.020
This poor woman.

37:16.347 --> 37:17.337
I know.

37:17.358 --> 37:21.053
I'm almost prepared to accept
Jonah Foster's story that

37:21.553 --> 37:25.016
- the shooting was an accident.
- Even if it wasn't?

37:25.386 --> 37:27.954
She's losing 2 grandsons in one day.

37:28.867 --> 37:30.970
Mr. Moses was the kidnapper.

37:31.044 --> 37:32.541
So it would appear.

37:40.271 --> 37:41.696
That's interesting.

37:43.120 --> 37:45.486
The stitching along
the back is irregular.

37:45.662 --> 37:47.922
It might just be a repair, but...

37:53.460 --> 37:55.638
No, there's something in here.

37:59.899 --> 38:01.327
"Adam Gordon.

38:01.964 --> 38:03.991
Care of Edna Bergman."

38:04.150 --> 38:05.655
He's alive?

38:05.904 --> 38:07.647
Perhaps he is.

38:08.757 --> 38:12.314
In the back of my mind I was
afraid it was too good to be true.

38:13.128 --> 38:16.134
Well, thank you, Detective.
A fraud has been uncovered.

38:16.161 --> 38:17.866
My grandmother's fortune is safe.

38:17.893 --> 38:20.695
I'm afraid it's not
that simple, Mr. Foster.

38:20.975 --> 38:24.923
You see, I believe your
stepbrother may still be alive.

38:25.043 --> 38:26.620
What?

38:26.740 --> 38:29.827
The kidnapper was carrying a letter

38:29.947 --> 38:32.473
intended for the real Adam Gordon.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.517
I believe he meant to deliver it to him.

38:34.555 --> 38:36.674
It's a forgery, obviously.

38:36.739 --> 38:40.390
- It's just another fraud.
- He is still alive.

38:40.875 --> 38:42.074
Where is he?

38:42.456 --> 38:45.019
I've asked the young man I
believe to be your grandson,

38:45.044 --> 38:47.208
- to come here today.
- This is ridiculous.

38:47.226 --> 38:49.209
Grandmother, let's go. Adam is dead.

38:49.213 --> 38:51.413
Shut up, Jonah, just shut up!

38:51.451 --> 38:54.252
Mr. Foster, it may be best if you leave.

38:54.269 --> 38:55.714
I will not.

38:56.097 --> 38:57.298
Is that him?

39:01.020 --> 39:02.138
Detective Murdoch.

39:02.258 --> 39:03.343
Mr. Bergman.

39:04.315 --> 39:05.318
Is this her?

39:06.174 --> 39:07.546
It is.

39:08.183 --> 39:09.873
I'm Adelia Gordon.

39:10.148 --> 39:13.345
And according to this
Detective, I am your grandmother.

39:14.004 --> 39:15.480
Do you recognize me?

39:16.551 --> 39:17.824
No.

39:23.137 --> 39:24.277
This?

39:25.947 --> 39:26.911
No.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.679
This is cruel, Detective.

39:28.847 --> 39:32.108
- Grandmother, let's go.
- Oh!

39:47.142 --> 39:48.093
You.

39:48.622 --> 39:49.616
What?

39:49.943 --> 39:50.851
He...

39:51.406 --> 39:52.684
he took me.

39:53.610 --> 39:55.618
- No, this is ridiculous...
- Jonah,

39:55.644 --> 39:57.231
what is he talking about?

39:57.351 --> 39:59.017
He gave me to a man! I rem...

39:59.206 --> 40:00.531
I remember now.

40:01.215 --> 40:02.583
Yeah, I was outside

40:02.703 --> 40:03.904
and you were there.

40:05.857 --> 40:07.630
He put his hand over my mouth.

40:09.061 --> 40:10.391
I do remember it.

40:12.696 --> 40:14.202
It's over, Mr. Foster.

40:15.640 --> 40:16.671
No.

40:17.609 --> 40:18.616
No!

40:18.995 --> 40:20.264
You're dead!

40:20.384 --> 40:22.201
You're supposed to be dead!

40:29.562 --> 40:32.466
You knew where the body was
buried all along, didn't you?

40:33.795 --> 40:35.851
- Yes.
- And when your grandmother started

40:35.868 --> 40:38.398
to believe Mr. Slaight's
story, you had to create

40:38.420 --> 40:40.729
a false note to lead me straight to it.

40:41.052 --> 40:43.814
Listen to me. If I could take
all of this back, I would.

40:44.898 --> 40:46.176
I was young,

40:46.245 --> 40:48.482
I hated Adam, I wanted
him out of my life.

40:48.499 --> 40:52.253
So you hired Mr. Moses to kidnap
and kill your own stepbrother.

40:52.834 --> 40:53.797
Yes.

40:54.424 --> 40:55.969
Yes, and I thought he had.

40:56.378 --> 40:58.715
I did. I saw a body.

40:58.873 --> 41:00.808
I saw the dead body of my own brother!

41:00.849 --> 41:03.053
Ha! Ha! Ha!

41:03.824 --> 41:07.020
You're a right piece of work aren't you?

41:07.041 --> 41:07.846
Shut up.

41:07.966 --> 41:11.370
I'm the bad one? You hired
someone to kill your brother.

41:11.387 --> 41:15.005
- Just shut up. Shut up!
- I'll leave you two to chat.

41:15.350 --> 41:17.738
It seems you have a
great deal in common.

41:19.731 --> 41:21.558
You're a monster, aren't you?

41:22.135 --> 41:23.430
So are you.

41:23.749 --> 41:26.726
Your own brother? My
God, you're horrible.

41:27.153 --> 41:28.461
Leave me alone!

41:28.495 --> 41:31.033
Leave you alone? No.
You shot me in the neck.

41:31.369 --> 41:33.649
You took advantage of an old woman.

41:35.146 --> 41:36.462
Congratulations.

41:36.802 --> 41:38.467
I hear you found Adam Gordon.

41:39.503 --> 41:40.476
Thank you.

41:41.874 --> 41:43.118
And you?

41:43.604 --> 41:46.454
Still chasing a ghost, it appears.

41:49.783 --> 41:51.714
- Tomorrow, then.
- Hmm.

41:57.610 --> 41:59.150
So...

41:59.194 --> 42:01.736
Did you find out anything about
this Miss Caroline McGovern?

42:01.856 --> 42:03.763
Nobody seems to remember her, sir.

42:04.406 --> 42:05.682
One of the forgotten.

42:06.917 --> 42:08.199
They don't have to be.

42:08.410 --> 42:10.630
Let's get back at it.
They're out there somewhere.

42:10.686 --> 42:13.277
I wish I had your unbridled optimism.

42:16.435 --> 42:19.327
- Detective, I understand.
- Understand what?

42:24.426 --> 42:26.296
Two years ago, I lost my wife.

42:26.666 --> 42:28.315
She passed away in my arms.

42:29.674 --> 42:31.929
The only difference
is I know where she is.

42:32.695 --> 42:34.489
So even if we never find your sister,

42:34.528 --> 42:36.701
we will find out what
happened to those women.

42:36.968 --> 42:39.429
So get up from your desk. Let's go.

42:40.638 --> 42:42.664
More to you than meets the eye, Jackson.

42:43.025 --> 42:44.880
Seems you're a man of action.

42:45.654 --> 42:46.820
Action Jackson.

42:47.345 --> 42:49.083
- Don't call me that.
- Alright.

42:57.504 --> 42:59.023
He's with God now.

42:59.900 --> 43:01.355
All thanks to you.

43:02.151 --> 43:04.522
No one deserves to be
buried without a name.

43:18.243 --> 43:19.599
Rest easy.

43:23.893 --> 43:25.085
On an all-new Murdoch.

43:25.115 --> 43:27.236
Somebody's making foul use of your land.

43:27.267 --> 43:28.919
When it comes to these murders...

43:28.936 --> 43:30.352
Three bodies were buried.

43:30.382 --> 43:31.686
Stay clear if I were you.

43:31.712 --> 43:32.908
... location is key.

43:32.938 --> 43:34.531
Welcome to the neighbourhood, Detective.

43:34.565 --> 43:36.131
An all-new Murdoch Mysteries,

43:36.148 --> 43:39.200
returns Monday, February 6th on CBC.
