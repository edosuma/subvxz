in my shoes.

what you're doing to me.

10:17.467 --> 10:20.585

Having children means a lot.

10:20.604 --> 10:22.754

10:22.773 --> 10:25.223

I don't know. I don't wanna
sacrifice our relationship.

10:31.198 --> 10:35.233
But I have this empty feeling
that more children,

10:35.268 --> 10:39.154
I think, will fulfill
that emptiness in my heart.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.105
[sniffles]
you know, all this emptiness,

10:41.124 --> 10:43.291

10:43.327 --> 10:47.579
like, every time March comes up,
you bring it up.

10:50.167 --> 10:53.134
I think the best thing for you
to really heal

10:53.170 --> 10:56.287
from the tragedy
of losing our daughter

10:56.306 --> 11:00.642
is to go talk to a therapist,
to get some professional help.

11:00.677 --> 11:06.348
There's nothing wrong with me
to get help. I know what I want.

11:06.400 --> 11:10.902
Duy has not dealt with the loss
of our daughter.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.655
I don't think he probably
healed that trauma

11:13.690 --> 11:18.360
because I was completely out
through the anesthetic.

11:18.412 --> 11:21.329
He saw the whole procedure--
taking her out,

11:21.365 --> 11:26.501
resuscitate her,
and there's more deep trauma

11:26.536 --> 11:28.486
than he realized.

11:28.505 --> 11:31.589
There are people out there
in the world

11:31.625 --> 11:33.675
that are probably dealing
with the same issue,

11:33.710 --> 11:36.160
and I'm pretty sure
professional out there

11:36.179 --> 11:39.497
willing to help,
and all I'm asking is

11:39.516 --> 11:41.966
go get help,
and if it<i> can</i> help you,

11:42.001 --> 11:45.220
it can help us,
but don't just, like,

11:45.272 --> 11:48.857
"no, I'm not gonna even make
that effort for you."

11:48.892 --> 11:51.609

11:51.645 --> 11:53.895
[sniffles]

11:53.947 --> 11:56.698
so my best answer for you
right now

11:56.733 --> 11:58.400
is let me think about it.

11:58.452 --> 12:00.351
Okay.

12:00.370 --> 12:03.154
In our culture,
we don't go to therapy.

12:03.189 --> 12:06.207
If he admit there is something
wrong with him,

12:06.243 --> 12:07.492
it's admitting
that he's a failure,

12:07.527 --> 12:11.496
admitting that he's weak,
admitting that he's vulnerable,

12:11.531 --> 12:14.365
and he doesn't want
to admit that.

12:14.401 --> 12:19.087
And so it's very, very difficult
for me to impose that on him.

12:20.757 --> 12:21.840
Let's just put it that way.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.893

14:50.156 --> 14:52.874
and the guidance we've had,

14:52.909 --> 14:57.495
I think for us...
Really saved us is

14:57.530 --> 15:00.498
learning
communication techniques.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.567
Before we went
to our marriage counselor,

15:02.602 --> 15:04.886
we went
to a discernment therapist.

15:30.664 --> 15:37.435
The only thing I feel
not really solid about still

is sometimes I don't have
