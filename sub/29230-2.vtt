24:05.527 --> 24:08.280
I just started going to school early.

24:09.531 --> 24:12.742
And then one day,
I noticed that the gym door was open,

24:12.826 --> 24:16.705
the coach told me, "Come on in.
Come work out if you like."

24:16.788 --> 24:17.664
So that's what I did.

24:18.790 --> 24:19.916
Every morning.

24:22.669 --> 24:25.297
I never even realized
that he was opening up the door for me

24:25.380 --> 24:26.923
so that I would have a place to go.

24:27.007 --> 24:29.009

24:30.969 --> 24:32.262
He was protecting me.

24:33.972 --> 24:35.974
And that's what you do for others now.

24:39.186 --> 24:42.731
I had no idea
that his wife had passed away.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.318
I should've been there for him.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.494
Are you still stressing over Simon?

24:56.578 --> 24:58.914
-All three of them.
-I thought there were only two.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.166
I thought so too,
but then I started thinking that

25:01.249 --> 25:03.376
on top of just Simon
and the actor playing Simon,

25:03.460 --> 25:05.754
I think there's a third,
an impostor Simon,

25:05.837 --> 25:08.381
who came to Chesapeake Shores
in lieu of my Simon.

25:08.465 --> 25:11.968
-So your date didn't go well.
-It went fine.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.262
It was like I was hanging out
with my best friend.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.932
We talked about literature and writing.

25:17.015 --> 25:19.267
-Your favorite things.
-Are they?

25:20.727 --> 25:23.521
-They are, yeah.
-It's what you two always talk about.

25:23.605 --> 25:27.651
I think I'm having an existential crisis,
Abby, or a literary one, I can't tell.

25:27.734 --> 25:31.738
-Maybe you should talk to him.
-Trust me, talking is not the problem.

25:31.821 --> 25:34.199
All we ever do is talk and talk and talk.

25:34.282 --> 25:38.078
Now I have to go to a rehearsal
to listen to more talking.

25:38.745 --> 25:39.829
Okay.

25:40.997 --> 25:42.123
Have fun.

25:44.668 --> 25:48.755
Del, I left word again
to get those documents from Porter,

25:48.838 --> 25:50.465

25:50.548 --> 25:53.468
Abby, you can stop working now.

25:54.552 --> 25:57.847
Porter Industries signed

with their life savings.

26:14.155 --> 26:17.033
Abby, this isn't from me.
It's from New York.

26:17.117 --> 26:20.036
They are no longer
a prospective client of ours.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.914
Now you have to walk away.

26:26.918 --> 26:29.504
I already said goodbye once,
I don't wanna say it again.

26:29.587 --> 26:31.172
I don't think the inn's gonna mind.

26:31.256 --> 26:34.634
-I just don't want it to end.
-I know. Me either.

26:35.635 --> 26:39.681
If it wasn't for you and the inn,
I'd still be waiting tables at Sally's.

26:39.764 --> 26:42.892
Or running a multimillion-dollar
corporation for my parents.

26:42.976 --> 26:44.561
One or the other.

26:44.644 --> 26:47.397
-We had so many amazing memories.
-We did.

26:47.480 --> 26:51.735
-Scones, quiches, our first kiss.
-Under the sprinklers.

David, you can't just close your eyes

27:08.752 --> 27:10.128
Close them.

What?

27:14.924 --> 27:15.925
Okay, open them.

27:18.678 --> 27:23.224
Look, we found perfect once.
We can find it again.

Maybe.

Um, first off, I'd like to explain
what happened the other day.

27:55.673 --> 27:58.426
Given our long-standing relationship,

27:58.510 --> 28:02.597
over time, some mistakes
can be expected--

28:02.680 --> 28:04.974
And these issues need to be discussed,

28:05.058 --> 28:08.144
specifically the idea
of taking this to court.

28:09.854 --> 28:10.772
We agree.

28:12.023 --> 28:16.361
You agree we should not go to court?

28:18.238 --> 28:22.283
Yes. After a long discussion
with our client,

28:22.367 --> 28:25.787
we believe that we will file
for immediate settlement.

28:25.870 --> 28:29.833
So sign, and we can put this to bed.

-We'll sign.

really sets up the ending.

30:08.139 --> 30:09.516
What? Why?

Connor, an attorney never asks
a question

30:11.726 --> 30:13.645
he doesn't already know the answer to.

That's why we're successful
at what we do.

30:17.982 --> 30:21.236
I understand, but in this case,
taking a risk, it made them blink.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.159
That's a problem, why?

31:10.243 --> 31:14.873
Because I'm realizing that my ideal Simon

38:27.680 --> 38:28.931
Hey, Kev.

38:30.725 --> 38:32.810
[CHANTING]
Coach! Coach! Coach!

38:32.893 --> 38:34.645
Coach! Coach! Coach!

38:34.729 --> 38:36.856
Coach! Coach! Coach!

38:36.939 --> 38:38.441
Coach! Coach! Coach!

38:38.524 --> 38:40.234
You don't have to do this.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.611
-Yeah, I did.
-Coach! Coach! Coach!

38:42.695 --> 38:44.071
[ALL CHEERING]

38:45.323 --> 38:46.991
TRACE:
Whoo! Yeah!

38:48.659 --> 38:50.661
[PLAYING COUNTRY MUSIC]

38:54.623 --> 38:56.417
Thanks for fixing the sound system.

38:56.500 --> 39:00.087
Hearing every note
just makes this band even worse.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.381
I should have thought that one through.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.550
Oh, Donovan left something
behind the bar.

39:26.655 --> 39:29.241
"To the man who grabbed the guitar
and walked away."

39:31.410 --> 39:32.495
[CHUCKLES]

39:36.749 --> 39:40.669
These are the latest books.
All orders and accounts are up to date.

39:40.753 --> 39:45.925
-Uh, okay. That's good.
-It's been a pleasure working with you.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.052
You're leaving?

39:48.135 --> 39:51.138
Got an offer to manage a chain
of waffle houses in the Mid-Atlantic.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.599
Does Mick know?

39:53.682 --> 39:57.144
It was his idea. He gave me my notice
as soon as he heard you were back.

39:58.312 --> 40:00.022
And if you ever go on tour again,

40:00.106 --> 40:02.441
we'd love to have you perform
at our establishments.

40:02.525 --> 40:05.277
Yeah, that's not gonna happen,
but thanks for the offer.

40:12.159 --> 40:14.787
Hey, Trace, will you do me a favor
and fire the band?

40:15.955 --> 40:17.289
-With pleasure.
-Cool.

40:17.373 --> 40:18.374
[TRACE CHUCKLES]

40:27.174 --> 40:30.970
Thank you for doing this. I just wanna
make sure that all the beats are there.

40:31.053 --> 40:35.141
My pleasure. Though I do warn you,
I'm not really much of an actor.

40:35.224 --> 40:38.018
Oh. I think you'll be able to jump right in.

40:38.102 --> 40:41.605
Oh, okay. I guess, away we go.

40:43.107 --> 40:43.941
Melanie.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.025
[♪♪♪]

40:45.526 --> 40:49.155
-Oh...
-Heh-heh. Jace. You're back.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.992
You know how hard it is for me
to stay away.

40:53.075 --> 40:56.287
You never could pass up
a decent literary trope.

40:56.370 --> 41:00.374
Or a strong female protagonist.
I think I've actually said that one.

41:00.458 --> 41:03.794
Um, conveniently,
I've been working on some new pages,

41:03.878 --> 41:06.172
and I'd love to know what you think.

41:06.255 --> 41:08.132
The curse of being a wordsmith.

41:08.591 --> 41:12.178
Luckily for you,
today I have a sale on verbs.

41:12.261 --> 41:14.054
I've definitely said that.

41:15.222 --> 41:16.432
Um...

41:16.515 --> 41:17.933
Well... Ahem.

41:19.477 --> 41:23.230
I was hoping that this time
it wouldn't be just words.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.398
Brilliant.

41:25.941 --> 41:27.193
What do you have in mind?

41:28.861 --> 41:33.115
Oh, I could think of one or two things.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.283
Really?

41:36.785 --> 41:39.163
I can only think of one.

41:52.092 --> 41:53.302
How was that?

41:54.720 --> 41:56.722
[♪♪♪]

41:57.556 --> 41:58.641
That was nice.

42:12.488 --> 42:13.489
[CLEARS THROAT]

42:14.031 --> 42:17.618
Del. What's, um, going on?

42:19.161 --> 42:23.082
Somebody leaked the Porter financials
to the Tribune.

42:26.418 --> 42:27.795
I couldn't let them hurt people.

42:28.921 --> 42:31.215
I'm sorry. I have no choice.

42:33.801 --> 42:38.264
You're officially suspended without pay,
pending a formal investigation.

42:38.722 --> 42:41.934
Please pack up your office
and turn in your keys.

42:42.476 --> 42:43.727
[♪♪♪]

42:44.937 --> 42:46.230
I'm so sorry.

42:47.231 --> 42:48.232
So am I.

42:51.610 --> 42:53.028
But I'm glad you did it.

43:07.001 --> 43:09.003
[♪♪♪]

44:01.180 --> 44:02.973
NARRATOR:
Next week on Chesapeake Shores:

44:03.057 --> 44:05.893
-You always did have good taste in dance partners.
TRACE: She's not ready.

44:06.060 --> 44:07.686
Don't you think you ought to
leave that up to her?

44:07.853 --> 44:09.897
-It's what everyone wants.
-What do you want?

44:10.022 --> 44:11.774
-I just want you.
-You've been served.

44:11.940 --> 44:14.568
We found the perfect inn
that someone else wants to buy.

44:14.652 --> 44:17.112
I feel like we're not connecting
and I don't know why.

44:17.321 --> 44:21.033
I don't want to walk away from what could be
by fearing what was.
