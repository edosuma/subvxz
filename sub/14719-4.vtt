00:05.680 --> 00:07.600
Did what was needed.

00:07.720 --> 00:10.000
You and Phim didn't needto beat the shit out of him.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.360
He needed to be
taught a lesson.

00:15.480 --> 00:18.880
If Dee's right, he
talked to McCarthy.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.080
He crossed the line.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.120
He knew what that meant.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.040
He knew what had happened.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.960
He was on the bones of his assand McCarthy was all over him.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.320
Doesn't make any difference.

00:33.120 --> 00:33.880
Rita.

00:34.000 --> 00:34.800
Hello, Bert.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.240
How are you holding up?

00:36.360 --> 00:37.520
I'm good.

00:37.640 --> 00:39.680
Thought you might
like some of these.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.560
I know Bert swears he nevergave McCarthy anything on us.

00:42.680 --> 00:43.960
And I believe him.

00:44.080 --> 00:48.240
But a narc is a narc
and he had to go.

00:48.360 --> 00:51.800
Ah, lamingtons.

00:51.920 --> 00:52.720
Thanks, Rita.

00:52.840 --> 00:53.600
Means a lot.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.280
It's nothing, Bert.

00:55.400 --> 00:59.160
Just paving a road, that's all.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.400
Enjoy.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.120
Thank you.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.840
The road to hell, you bastard.

01:04.960 --> 01:05.960
It's done, guys.

01:06.080 --> 01:06.920
Bert's out.

01:07.040 --> 01:07.800
We find a new driver.

01:11.120 --> 01:11.920
Heads up.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.520
Mr. McCarthy.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.560
Suppose you boys have
been here all afternoon?

01:15.680 --> 01:16.640
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

01:16.760 --> 01:18.000
And you know nothing about it?

01:18.120 --> 01:19.240
About what?

01:19.360 --> 01:20.240
Your mate.

01:20.360 --> 01:21.360
Bert Thompson.

01:21.480 --> 01:22.760
He's your mate, not ours.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.120
Is that so, Ted?

01:24.240 --> 01:25.960
Is that why he's currentlylying in hospital?

01:26.080 --> 01:28.400
An inch away from fucking death.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.440
No?

01:29.560 --> 01:30.760
Nothing?

01:30.880 --> 01:32.680
No idea how he ended
up eating a lamington

01:32.800 --> 01:34.760
laced with rat poison?

01:34.880 --> 01:38.240
I'm no fan of Bert, but hedidn't fucking deserve that.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.400
You were weak
when you should have

01:48.520 --> 01:50.520
been strong, shown
everyone what happens

01:50.640 --> 01:51.920
when you narc on Ted West.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.280
But Bert didn't give us up.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.640
What about all the jobs
you've done in the past?

01:55.760 --> 01:57.160
Bert was weak.

01:57.280 --> 01:58.520
Sooner or later he wouldhave given up on one of them.

01:58.640 --> 01:59.800
You can tie on
the [inaudible]..

01:59.920 --> 02:01.200
Last I heard, he's still alive.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.080
Just.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.880
Well, he's dead to me.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.960
Yeah, but not actually dead.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.680
So what happens if hepoints the finger at you?

02:07.800 --> 02:09.400
Have you got that part
of your plan sorted?

02:09.520 --> 02:11.440
I won't deny it if I'm asked.

02:11.560 --> 02:12.920
That's attempted murder, Rita.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.600
Only if he lives.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.280
Don't give me that look.

02:17.400 --> 02:22.600
Bert Thompson does not deserveto breathe the same air as us.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.840
Jesus, Rita.

02:25.960 --> 02:27.640
I thought we left this
shit behind years ago.

02:27.760 --> 02:28.560
What?

02:31.440 --> 02:32.840
No.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.800
No, you hold on right there.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.520
This has nothing
to do with that.

02:36.640 --> 02:39.760
Doesn't it?
Killing Bert over this?

02:39.880 --> 02:40.880
That's not rational.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.320
That's the act of a mad woman.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.640
How fucking dare you?

02:44.760 --> 02:46.000
Really?

02:46.120 --> 02:47.080
Because right now I'm
scared what might happen

02:47.200 --> 02:48.320
to me next time I piss you off.

02:48.440 --> 02:49.880
How can you say that, Ted?

02:50.000 --> 02:53.040
You know I would
never, ever hurt you.

02:53.160 --> 02:53.920
Just our son.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.880
I told you, that has
nothing to do with--

02:59.000 --> 02:59.880
What?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.760
You trying to kill our child?

03:01.880 --> 03:04.320
If I hadn't stopped
you, he would be dead.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.240
RITA: That was different!

03:05.360 --> 03:06.440
How would I know?

03:06.560 --> 03:07.880
I didn't understand that!

03:08.000 --> 03:08.960
I don't get this!

03:09.080 --> 03:10.440
You explain to the difference!

03:10.560 --> 03:11.320
It had to be done!

03:11.440 --> 03:12.320
No, it didn't!

03:12.440 --> 03:13.240
It did!

03:18.640 --> 03:20.120
Why did you try and kill me?

03:24.000 --> 03:24.760
I didn't.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.480
Dad just said you did.

03:26.600 --> 03:27.720
Wolf, , you need
to go back to bed.

03:27.840 --> 03:28.840
We can talk about this tomorrow.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.360
What had I done wrong?

03:31.480 --> 03:34.640
You hadn't done
anything wrong.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.320
You were just a baby.

03:36.440 --> 03:39.000
I thought you loved me.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.680
Wolf.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.200
Hey, your mother wasn't well.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.120
Hey!

03:43.240 --> 03:44.120
It was a long time ago.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.400
Now, come on.
It's late.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.280
Get to bed.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.440
Rita!

04:00.560 --> 04:01.320
Rita!

04:06.040 --> 04:06.800
Rita!

04:10.440 --> 04:12.320

04:41.280 --> 04:43.200

like [inaudible]..

04:43.320 --> 04:44.640
We're progressing.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.240
Phineas, where's the cash?

04:49.360 --> 04:51.600
Well, I bought some
stuff for the shop.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.240
I wrote those up
too, like you said.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.520
Bloody hell, Phineas.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.560
This is more than you
pay for the stuff new.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.560
Really?

05:02.680 --> 05:04.800
Yes, really.

05:04.920 --> 05:08.920
That would explain why
they were all so happy.

05:09.040 --> 05:12.000
Plus I took some to buy somenew clothes for my meeting

05:12.120 --> 05:13.080
with Carol.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.280
Thought I'd look nice, you know?

05:15.400 --> 05:16.680
Think she wants me back, dude.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.040
Uh, huh.

05:18.160 --> 05:21.240
And I'll definitely ask
her if she's seen Rita.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.320
You don't have to do that.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.240
[phone rings]

05:25.360 --> 05:26.160
The Galleria.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.600
So I get a call from the school.

05:32.720 --> 05:35.240
You told your math teacher togo fuck himself and walked out?

05:35.360 --> 05:36.880
- I don't like math.
- It's school.

05:37.000 --> 05:37.760
You're not mean to like it.

05:37.880 --> 05:38.960
You're just meant to go.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.600
What's the point?

05:40.720 --> 05:42.360
The point?

05:42.480 --> 05:43.760
The point is, you have to.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.480
Why?

05:45.600 --> 05:47.480
Because it's the law.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.400
That's rich coming from you.

05:49.520 --> 05:53.160
This is where you say, wait tillyour mother gets home, right?

05:53.280 --> 05:56.040
She'll be back.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.160
She just needs time, that's all.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.760
It's been two months, Dad.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.200
And do you even
know where she is?

06:03.320 --> 06:04.080
Exactly.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.800
[door slams]

06:28.720 --> 06:32.240
Why do they call
you Christmas?

06:32.360 --> 06:34.560
Everyone here
has another name.

06:34.680 --> 06:37.120
I'm Carol, so they
call me Christmas.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.040
All right.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.520
Hm.

06:39.640 --> 06:43.440
Also, I'm very giving.

06:43.560 --> 06:46.640
Have you met my friend, Mandy?

06:46.760 --> 06:47.600
Yes, please.

07:11.240 --> 07:12.640
Hold that thought, Tiger.

07:12.760 --> 07:13.640
I have to go find Mother.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.600
Your mother?

07:15.720 --> 07:16.560
Our dab mother.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.160
I think I'm going
to be bad again.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.760
You don't need my
permission, Carol.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.400
I just thought
you should know.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.240
Now I do.

07:36.360 --> 07:40.560
Oh, do whatever or
whoever you want.

07:40.680 --> 07:42.480
I'm busy here.

07:42.600 --> 07:43.400
So I see.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.120
She said disapproving.

07:45.240 --> 07:48.840
I don't like you
doing that stuff.

07:48.960 --> 07:49.840
It fills the void.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.160
I need you, Bilkey.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.800
No, you need Rita.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.200
Think if I knew
where she was, we'd

07:59.320 --> 08:00.760
be having this conversation?

08:03.760 --> 08:05.120
Have you heard from her?

08:05.240 --> 08:06.480
I know you talk to her.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.600
Not since that day.

08:09.720 --> 08:10.840
Can you at least
talk to Phineas?

08:10.960 --> 08:12.120
Just give him some tips.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.160
You stand behind the counter.

08:13.280 --> 08:14.320
You serve the bloody customers.

08:14.440 --> 08:15.560
It's not rocket science.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.960
Oh, bugger.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.200
Hey, guys.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.080
Here for a meeting, Bert?

08:20.200 --> 08:21.000
Hey?

08:21.120 --> 08:22.120
No, just a beer.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.320
Yeah, I was
going to say, don't

08:23.440 --> 08:24.400
see McCarthy here anywhere.

08:24.520 --> 08:25.640
I don't do that shit anymore.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.480
Oh, he visited
you in hospital?

08:27.600 --> 08:28.480
Bought you flowers?

08:28.600 --> 08:30.520
No way.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.040
You know they reckon I was abouta minute away from dying, hey?

08:33.160 --> 08:34.800
Doesn't mean we're goingto kiss and make up, Bert.

08:34.920 --> 08:37.560
I didn't say a word aboutyour wife trying to kill me.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.960
It's going to prove
something, hey?

08:40.080 --> 08:41.760
What are you doing here?

08:41.880 --> 08:43.080
Having a beer, talking to Ted.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.440
Pretty sure he doesn't
want to talk to you.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.360
So, fuck off.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.200
I could have.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.120
I didn't.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.120
What did that prick want?

08:58.240 --> 08:59.960
Absolution.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.480
But he's not even a Catholic.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.640
It's a figure of
speech, Phineas.

09:03.760 --> 09:04.600
You all right, Ted?

09:04.720 --> 09:08.040
It's all turning to shit.

09:08.160 --> 09:13.880
Everything is just, just shit.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.280
Geez, Ted.
Are you crying?

09:20.480 --> 09:23.080
It's OK, mate.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.000

10:31.920 --> 10:33.240
Sorry.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.560
It's all right.

10:34.680 --> 10:35.520

see what needs doing.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.640
Yeah.

Oh, Christ, what's the A

10:43.120 --> 10:43.920
Relax.

10:44.040 --> 10:46.400
I got Wolf off to school.

10:46.520 --> 10:47.840
You did?

10:47.960 --> 10:49.600
A few harsh words werespoken, but eventually he

10:49.720 --> 10:52.120
got the message.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.320
Thank you.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.960
Why don't you go
and have a shower?

10:55.080 --> 10:56.560
And I'll make some breakfast.

- You want to come?
- Why would I?

12:08.440 --> 12:09.800
trouble, trouble, trouble.

12:09.920 --> 12:10.720
Shut up.

12:14.760 --> 12:17.720
Carol, there is one
thing you can do.

12:24.920 --> 12:26.760
- Hi, Wolfie.
- [inaudible], Carol.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.080
How you doing?

12:29.200 --> 12:30.680
Your mom asked me to
give you a message.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.080
- Why?
- What?

12:32.200 --> 12:33.920
Why can't she
give me the message?

12:34.040 --> 12:35.680
She didn't say.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.400
She just said for me totell you that she loves you.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.280
- How?
- What?

12:39.400 --> 12:40.680
How does she love me?

12:40.800 --> 12:41.640
I don't know what you mean.

12:41.760 --> 12:42.640
I don't know what she means.

12:45.800 --> 12:49.800
She loves me, but she triedto kill me when I was a baby.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.440
I didn't know that.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.680
So I don't know what it meanswhen she says she loves me.

12:53.800 --> 12:54.680
Can I tell her you're OK?

12:54.800 --> 12:58.880
But I'm not so why say I am?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.800
I'm going to go now.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.640
Is there anything you wantto say to your mother?

13:02.760 --> 13:03.880
Yeah.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.840
But I want to say
it to her, not you.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.040
You don't have
to do this, Ngaire.

13:20.160 --> 13:20.920
Someone has to.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.400
Have you heard from her?

13:29.520 --> 13:30.680
No.

13:30.800 --> 13:31.640
Have you

13:31.760 --> 13:32.960
[chuckle]

13:33.080 --> 13:35.800
I'm the last person
to get in touch with.

13:35.920 --> 13:38.120
Not quite.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.000
Have you spoken to the police?

13:40.120 --> 13:41.200
Why?

13:41.320 --> 13:42.400
Because she topped herself?

13:42.520 --> 13:43.800
That's not Rita's style.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.200
I meant a missing
persons thingie.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.560
She's not missing.
She's just gone.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.120
I should get on, hey?

13:55.240 --> 13:56.120
Find us a job.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.280
Get some bloody money coming in.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.760
How did it go last night?

13:59.880 --> 14:01.120
Lefty arrived in the wee small.

14:01.240 --> 14:04.120
Said you were out casing a job?

14:04.240 --> 14:05.600
Oh, right yeah.

14:05.720 --> 14:06.680
You know.

14:06.800 --> 14:07.560
Yeah, I do.

14:16.600 --> 14:17.400
Hi.

14:17.520 --> 14:18.280
Hi, Phineas.

14:20.920 --> 14:25.760
You look different,
but still beautiful.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.680
Thank you.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.680
I've got these for you.

14:28.800 --> 14:29.600
You shouldn't have done that.

14:29.720 --> 14:30.840
I like getting you flowers.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.520
And Bilkey says that
if you got something

14:32.640 --> 14:36.080
you want to say to a lady,you should give them flowers.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.800
Bilkey knows a lot about ladies.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.320
Yeah, he does.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.600
So I got these for you.

14:40.720 --> 14:41.480
OK.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.280
[clears throat]

14:46.400 --> 14:47.520
I was the one that
wanted to talk to you.

14:47.640 --> 14:48.840
I know.

14:48.960 --> 14:52.240
But I think I know what
you're going to say.

14:52.360 --> 14:55.320
And I wanted to say yes.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.360
To the divorce?

14:57.480 --> 14:58.240
The what?

14:58.360 --> 15:00.280
I want to get a divorce.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.600
What did you think
I was going to say?

15:01.720 --> 15:02.600
That you were coming back.

15:06.160 --> 15:10.800
Can we go inside and getsomething to eat while we talk?

15:10.920 --> 15:15.280
I'm kind of cold and Ihaven't eaten for a few days.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.520
Can we do that,
Phin, sit and talk?

15:31.440 --> 15:32.480
Mates?

15:32.600 --> 15:33.480
Lefty.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.800
Did you follow up on that job?

15:34.920 --> 15:36.200
Straight get into
business, are we?

15:36.320 --> 15:38.200
Well, weren't you
out all night doing it?

15:38.320 --> 15:40.440
Hey?

15:40.560 --> 15:41.680
Tell us about the gold dealer.

15:41.800 --> 15:42.800
Shut up shop.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.800
Moved to Brisbane,
thereby raising

15:44.920 --> 15:45.880
the IQ of both countries.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.680
[chuckling]

15:47.800 --> 15:48.720
That's what Muldoon said.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.640
I know what the
little pig said,

15:50.760 --> 15:52.640
and you know not to mentionhis name in my presence.

15:52.760 --> 15:53.800
Brisbane's going off.

15:53.920 --> 15:54.960
Well, that's no
bloody good, is it?

15:55.080 --> 15:56.880
We need a job
here, not Brisbane.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.800
Look, I ran into a bloke,guy i know from the rag trade,

16:00.920 --> 16:02.600
reckon he could throw
some work our way.

16:02.720 --> 16:03.720
What, in the rag trade?

16:03.840 --> 16:05.600
He's not in the
rag trade any more.

16:05.720 --> 16:08.520
Well, what sort
of trade is he in?

16:08.640 --> 16:10.480
The drug trade.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.680
No.
No way.

16:11.800 --> 16:12.880
A lot of money in
drugs these days.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.240
We're not drug dealers.

16:14.360 --> 16:15.560
We're not bloody robbers
at the moment, are we?

16:15.680 --> 16:19.520
Could be a sideline
between actual jobs.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.520
He wants to meet.

16:21.640 --> 16:24.080
There's a party as
Des McEwen's place.

16:31.080 --> 16:31.960
Sorry.

16:32.080 --> 16:32.920
Sorry I'm late.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.320
Geez.

16:34.440 --> 16:35.560
Have you been calling as well?

16:38.680 --> 16:41.240
Just been to see Carol.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.440
Thought she was
coming back, hey?

16:43.560 --> 16:44.880
Do tell she wants a divorce.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.960
And I thought-- oh,
I still love her.

16:49.080 --> 16:51.080
Oh, for fuck's sake.

16:51.200 --> 16:54.480
What is wrong with
the men of this gang?

16:54.600 --> 16:56.080
They're just women.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.440
You still got cocks so finsomeone else to stick it into.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.480
Yeah, good advice, Lefty.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.760
It needed to be said.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.280
She seen Rita.

17:10.520 --> 17:14.480
Wouldn't say she is, but
she said other stuff.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.680
There's this painter.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.240
A house painter?

17:29.880 --> 17:30.680
More like an artist.

17:37.920 --> 17:42.240
She said Rita's been doingsome modeling for him.

17:42.360 --> 17:45.600
You know, posing and stuff.

17:45.720 --> 17:48.640
You'd do better paintingthe couch without me on it.

17:48.760 --> 17:51.320
It's just a shitty couch.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.800
Just a shitty person.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.520
She reckons that's not
all she's been doing.

18:09.080 --> 18:11.280
She can do what she likes.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.640
Nothing to do with me.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.640
This dealer, what's his name?

18:18.760 --> 18:19.560
Marty Johnston.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.960
I have to deliver a paintingto this lawyer fellow.

18:33.080 --> 18:34.160
You want to come?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.480
I try to avoid lawyers.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.360
This guy is different.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.040
You'll have fun.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.040
Fun is good, by the way.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.480
Fine, sure, whatever.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.360
Cool.

18:48.440 --> 18:49.240
Have you got a car?

19:13.520 --> 19:16.080
[inaudible] you here to haveyour way with some dolly bird?

19:16.200 --> 19:16.960
Never.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.440
This is business.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.480
Though if you wanted toget one out of your system,

19:20.600 --> 19:22.880
stress relief, there'd
be plenty of takers.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.520
Jesus Christ.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.200
Ted Bloody West.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.400
I'd say lock up your valuables,but there's no point with you

19:28.520 --> 19:29.880
around.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.680
Mr. McEwen I don't believewe've officially met.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.760
I know who you are.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.520
We move in the same circles.

19:35.640 --> 19:38.520
I thought it was more that youcircled round people like me.

19:38.640 --> 19:40.080
Are you calling
me a shark, Ted?

19:40.200 --> 19:43.000
I was thinking more oneof them birds that flies.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.400
So, what brings
you to my party?

19:48.520 --> 19:50.760
Marty we should drop by.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.320
Stepping up into
the big time, hey?

19:52.440 --> 19:54.760
Just, you know,
having a catch up.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.240
Leave you boys to it.

19:56.360 --> 20:00.000
Anything, you need, [inaudible].

20:00.120 --> 20:02.320
Mm.

20:02.440 --> 20:05.200
Let's get this over with. thisplace is giving me the shits.

20:05.320 --> 20:06.080
Bilkey.

20:06.200 --> 20:07.720
Hey, Marty.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.600
This is Ted I told you about.

20:09.720 --> 20:11.880
Ted, Marty Johnston.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.720
Bilkey said you'reinterested in having a chat.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.720
Plenty of time for that, Ted.

20:15.840 --> 20:16.920
Relax.

20:17.040 --> 20:17.920
Enjoy.

20:18.040 --> 20:18.960
Business later.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.560
Business now if
you don't mind.

20:20.680 --> 20:23.080
We won't be staying long.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.320
Have it your own way.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.160
You know what I do, right?

20:27.280 --> 20:30.560
Bilkey has clued me in.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.280
And you're a safe man.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.560
Safe as houses.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.640
No, I mean you're
one of the old breed.

20:35.760 --> 20:36.520
Safe--

20:36.640 --> 20:38.160
I know what you mean.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.720
How's the safe
cracking business

20:39.840 --> 20:41.080
working out for you these days?

20:41.200 --> 20:42.160
It's fine.

20:42.280 --> 20:44.480
Is that why you
are talking to me?

20:44.600 --> 20:46.600
Just keeping an open
mind to the future.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.280
Wise man.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.520
Because I'll tell you one thing.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.920
The future is not in safes.

20:52.040 --> 20:53.280
Right.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.680
And where do you keep
your money then, Marty?

20:55.800 --> 20:58.560
In circulation,
Ted, like a fish.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.840
- Fish.
- Always moving.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.280
Making more money.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.200
Fair enough.

21:05.320 --> 21:06.960
None for me.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.560
You got something
against drugs, Ted?

21:08.680 --> 21:10.160
Tried mescaline once.

21:10.280 --> 21:13.520
Scared the heck out of me soI stick to beer these days.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.520
All the more for me then.

21:20.960 --> 21:23.720
Come on, ladies.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.200
And we're off.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.600
Oh, fuck me.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.760
I need someone here
looking after my shit

21:35.880 --> 21:38.520
who isn't some fuckingjunkie trying to rip me off.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.200
Now Bilkey says that you area man that can be trusted.

21:41.320 --> 21:42.160
Are you?

21:42.280 --> 21:44.520
Yeah, I'd like to think so.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.080
Good.

21:46.200 --> 21:46.960
Then we can do business.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.520
I don't know anything
about your business.

21:51.640 --> 21:53.840
Not a problem.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.760
I tell you what to do.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.120
Your job will be to get it done.

21:58.240 --> 22:01.720
In return, money will
rain down upon you.

22:01.840 --> 22:05.120
Do we have a deal?

22:05.240 --> 22:06.560
No.

22:06.680 --> 22:07.680
We have something to talk about.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.920
I like and respect that.

22:14.040 --> 22:16.080
I'm here for another couple ofdays and then the offer is off.

22:22.000 --> 22:22.840
All good?

22:22.960 --> 22:23.960
Up to a point.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.040
Gents.

22:32.440 --> 22:33.200
We should shoot through.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.120
This place isn't for us.

22:34.240 --> 22:35.080
I don't' know.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.160
You seem quite at home here.

22:36.280 --> 22:39.440
Let's stick around for a gander.

22:39.560 --> 22:40.840
Don't say I didn't warn you.

22:54.120 --> 22:54.920
Oh.

22:55.040 --> 22:55.840
Whoa!

22:55.960 --> 22:58.240
Yeah!

22:58.360 --> 23:00.160
Carol.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.120
Ted.

23:01.240 --> 23:02.320
What are you doing?

23:17.120 --> 23:20.320
What are you doing here?

23:20.440 --> 23:22.120
Sorry, Rita.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.080
You lost the right to allquestions about what the fuck

23:24.200 --> 23:27.800
I'm doing anywhere when
you walked out on us.

23:27.920 --> 23:31.240
Gotta love a lawyer who
pays cash on the nose.

23:31.360 --> 23:32.200
Hey, mate.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.040
[crack]

23:37.600 --> 23:39.360
Didn't to hit him.

23:39.480 --> 23:41.000
Oh well, call
me old fashioned,

23:41.120 --> 23:43.520
but when I see a bloke with hishands all over my wife's tits,

23:43.640 --> 23:45.240
smacking him seemed like
the logical thing to do.

23:50.200 --> 23:52.560
Then you need to stopthinking of me as your wife.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.560
So that's it, is it?

23:57.680 --> 24:00.680
All those years of marriage justwalked out the door with you?

24:00.800 --> 24:02.560
Isn't that what's
best for everyone?

24:02.680 --> 24:04.680
You get mad Rita
out of your life

24:04.800 --> 24:06.400
so you don't have to
sleep with one eye open.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.000
Stop looking at me like that.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.920
It really what you want?

24:15.040 --> 24:17.840
Nothing in this
world is what I want.

24:17.960 --> 24:18.720
But it's what should be.

24:18.840 --> 24:20.240
And what about your son?

24:20.360 --> 24:23.520
The one who thinksthat I tried to kill him?

24:23.640 --> 24:25.160
Because I did.

24:25.280 --> 24:28.840
Because if you hadn't walkedin when you did, I would have.

24:28.960 --> 24:29.760
Guilty.

24:29.880 --> 24:30.640
Your Honor.

24:33.320 --> 24:34.760
He's better off without me.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.640
Oh, that's shit
and you know it.

24:36.760 --> 24:39.760
You didn't see what
I saw in his eyes.

24:39.880 --> 24:42.800
I can't go back to that.

24:42.920 --> 24:46.360
Trust me when I say, you
need to forget about me

24:46.480 --> 24:48.040
and you need to
get away from here.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.400
These people are not you, Ted,so don't try being one of them.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.880
So how did it go with Marty?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.960
Marty's an idiot,
be dead within a year.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.160
No way we're having
anything to do with him.

25:00.280 --> 25:02.080
You got that from afive minute conversation?

25:02.200 --> 25:03.400
Got that when I
copped eyes on him.

25:03.520 --> 25:05.320
The conversation
just confirmed it.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.960
So we're leaving or what?

25:15.080 --> 25:17.120
Waiting.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.800
For Rita?

25:18.920 --> 25:20.280
For dark.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.480
Why?

25:21.600 --> 25:23.760
We need a job.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.360
And there's a safe
in McEwen's office.

25:26.480 --> 25:27.800
How's the safe
cracking business

25:27.920 --> 25:30.120
working out for you these days?

25:30.240 --> 25:31.680
It's fine.

25:31.800 --> 25:32.840
You out of your fucking tree?

25:32.960 --> 25:34.200
He'll know it was us.

25:34.320 --> 25:35.400
So what?

25:35.520 --> 25:36.840
No one likes him.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.240
No one will lift a fingerif he gets turned out.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.360
Ted, you're not
thinking clearly.

25:40.480 --> 25:41.440
Seeing Rita has messed--

25:41.560 --> 25:43.200
This has nothing
to do with her.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.120
He has money.
We need money.

25:45.240 --> 25:46.640
So we wait.

25:46.760 --> 25:47.960
End of bloody story.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.640
[SLURRING] You think it'sOK to leave your friend there?

26:27.760 --> 26:28.800
She can take care of herself.

26:33.520 --> 26:34.280
Whoa.

26:39.880 --> 26:40.760
Get you in.

27:11.840 --> 27:12.720
Two minutes.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.720
WOMAN: To get in my pants.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.080
I know what guys are like.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.960
MARTY: I bet you do.

27:56.080 --> 27:57.720
So you'd really
pay for our tickets?

27:57.840 --> 27:59.600
And the rest.

27:59.720 --> 28:00.920
I've always wanted
to go to London.

28:01.040 --> 28:03.800
It's the best
city in the world.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.040
I have to ask Rita.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.280
Well, does Rita
like traveling too?

28:07.400 --> 28:08.600
Yeah.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.560
We've been talking about
going away together.

28:10.680 --> 28:13.440
Bring her along.

28:13.560 --> 28:15.720
In the meantime,
a little gratitude

28:15.840 --> 28:20.280
goes a long way in my book.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.200
OK.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.520
I knew you never like my--

29:26.640 --> 29:28.520
Jesus, Ngaire.

29:28.640 --> 29:31.640
No need to throw it all
over the bloody floor.

29:31.760 --> 29:33.560
What are you talking a--

29:33.680 --> 29:35.720
Well, not me, I'm afraid.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.520
What?

29:40.640 --> 29:41.800
Think some kind of point?

29:44.560 --> 29:46.600
I always liked your cooking.

29:46.720 --> 29:47.720
Oh, right.

29:47.840 --> 29:48.840
That makes sense.

29:51.520 --> 29:52.360
I'll clean it up later.

29:52.480 --> 29:53.280
No way.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.600
Wolf can do it.

29:54.720 --> 29:55.560
He's not here.

29:58.800 --> 29:59.640
Of course he's not.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.920
Look, you don't have to
keep cleaning for us.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.240
Why not?

30:09.360 --> 30:11.080
There's no one at my
house to make a mess.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.880
And the kids are
staying at my sister's.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.200
They are.

30:15.320 --> 30:16.760
And as for Lefty.

30:20.600 --> 30:24.880
It this the bit where you tellme Lefty was with you tonight?

30:25.000 --> 30:25.760
No.

30:25.880 --> 30:26.680
It's not.

30:33.480 --> 30:36.160
Funny how life works out.

30:36.280 --> 30:38.360
I chose the rat and
you chose the psycho.

30:41.280 --> 30:44.200
Should have stuck with
our original choices.

30:44.320 --> 30:45.120
Yeah, you think?

32:07.760 --> 32:09.880
[SINGING] Go to sea, boy.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.120
Get to sea.

32:13.240 --> 32:16.360
My luck in the gutter black.

32:16.480 --> 32:21.480
I guess I'm running back to you.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.440
You in my way.

32:23.560 --> 32:25.360
You in my heart.

32:25.480 --> 32:27.320
You in my brain.

32:27.440 --> 32:31.200
You in my heart.

32:31.320 --> 32:33.640
You in my heart.

32:33.760 --> 32:35.200
Come on, soldier.

32:35.320 --> 32:36.080
Time to go.

32:36.200 --> 32:37.120
I want my bed back.

32:40.920 --> 32:41.720
Wakie, wakie.

32:45.040 --> 32:45.840
Wake up!

32:49.440 --> 32:50.600
Oh, shit!

32:50.720 --> 32:52.280
Wake up!

32:52.400 --> 32:53.160
Help!

32:53.280 --> 32:54.640
I need help in here!

32:58.320 --> 32:59.080
Help!

33:02.680 --> 33:03.520
It's OK.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.000
We got this.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.320
Come on!

33:17.440 --> 33:20.280
Wake the fuck up!

33:20.400 --> 33:21.760
[gasp]

33:21.880 --> 33:23.320
It's all right, mate.

33:23.440 --> 33:24.600
You're back.

33:24.720 --> 33:25.560
You're back.

33:29.480 --> 33:33.760
Shit happens round
here from time to time.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.720
You'll get used to it.

33:41.680 --> 33:44.000
[knocking]

33:48.080 --> 33:51.880
You seriously stole a shitloadof cash from Des McEwen.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.640
It was an opportunity
and I took it.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.040
And yeah, the cash was a shitload and you get your cut.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.160
So why is there a problem?

33:57.280 --> 33:58.440
It's Des Fucking
McEwen's cash.

33:58.560 --> 34:00.320
Which he took from
working men like us.

34:00.440 --> 34:01.560
Ted, we get that
you're not exactly

34:01.680 --> 34:02.960
thinking straight
ever since Rita

34:03.080 --> 34:04.480
went Looney Tunes, but this--[crack]

34:04.600 --> 34:05.720
Jesus, dude!

34:05.840 --> 34:07.200
No one talks about
my wife like that.

34:07.320 --> 34:08.840
What wife?
You don't have a wife.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.400
She went off the deepend in your [inaudible]..

34:10.520 --> 34:12.040
Leave him, Ted.

34:12.160 --> 34:13.680
You're only hurting him becausehe's telling you the truth.

34:13.800 --> 34:14.600
The truth.

34:14.720 --> 34:15.480
You want the truth?

34:15.600 --> 34:17.160
Oh, Ted, don't

34:17.280 --> 34:19.040
At least my wife isn't handingout blow jobs to drug dealers.

34:19.160 --> 34:20.480
[crack]

34:20.600 --> 34:23.200
What the fuck
is going on here?

34:23.320 --> 34:24.200
Des.

34:24.320 --> 34:26.240
We was just talking about you.

34:26.360 --> 34:27.560
Really, Bilkey?

34:27.680 --> 34:29.240
Hope you were saying
that the stuff you stole

34:29.360 --> 34:32.480
from Des McEwen, that you reallymust get it back to him pronto.

34:32.600 --> 34:33.800
What stuff is that?

34:33.920 --> 34:36.120
You really want to
play this game, Ted?

34:36.240 --> 34:37.520
We don't know anything
about any stuff.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.240
Didn't walk out of my
house with a suitcase

34:39.360 --> 34:40.440
that didn't belong to you?

34:40.560 --> 34:41.480
Nope.

34:41.600 --> 34:42.800
Means nothing.

34:42.920 --> 34:44.600
Look at me.

34:44.720 --> 34:45.920
Look at my face.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.560
It doesn't look too good, Des.

34:47.680 --> 34:50.880
How much does a beating
like that cost you?

34:51.000 --> 34:52.600
A fucking comedian.

34:52.720 --> 34:54.440
The stuff that you stole
belongs to the people

34:54.560 --> 34:55.680
who did this to me.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.800
Just imagine what
they will do to you.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.320
So you listen to me.

34:59.440 --> 35:01.000
I don't give a shit aboutyou and your little empire

35:01.120 --> 35:03.440
you've got going on out here inthe middle of fucking nowhere.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.360
You do not register
on my fucking radar.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.320
That suitcase however, does.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.440
And if you do not return
that suitcase today,

35:10.560 --> 35:13.280
you will open the door to aworld of pain that none of you

35:13.400 --> 35:14.840
will survive.

35:14.960 --> 35:15.720
You got that?

35:18.760 --> 35:19.880
I will await your visit.

35:26.480 --> 35:29.760
Thanks, Ted, for draggingus into your world of shit.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.240
Just give it back to him, OK?

35:31.360 --> 35:33.640
So the rest of us can
continue breathing.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.160
What he said.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.920
Does it strike you
as odd that he never

35:43.040 --> 35:46.200
actually used the word money?

35:46.320 --> 35:48.640
Just the word suitcase.

35:48.760 --> 35:50.600
Was that the very
satisfying sound of you

35:50.720 --> 35:51.640
hitting my husband?

35:54.720 --> 35:56.160
It's OK, Ted.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.120
Bilkey is good at keepingsecrets, aren't you, Bilkey?

35:58.240 --> 35:59.600
Like the grave.

35:59.720 --> 36:04.120
I'm going to go play thegood wife and to his wounds.

36:04.240 --> 36:06.040
Call it a reminder of
what you could have had.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.240
Hey, you were
the one suggesting

36:13.360 --> 36:14.640
I needed stress relief.

36:14.760 --> 36:16.720
Yeah, with a nameless
tart, not Ngaire.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.000
Feels a bit heavy for
something that's empty.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.760
Not so stupid after all.

36:49.880 --> 36:51.680
Just a go-between, Des.

36:51.800 --> 36:52.960
Is that so?

36:53.080 --> 36:56.840
Like I said, it's
nothing to do with us.

36:56.960 --> 36:59.400
But I did track down
what you're after.

36:59.520 --> 37:00.800
As a sign of good faith.

37:05.440 --> 37:09.800
Ladies, I'm offering youfirst class air fares, the best

37:09.920 --> 37:12.040
hotels and more money
than you've ever

37:12.160 --> 37:14.000
dreamed of in your entire life.

37:14.120 --> 37:15.400
To take all your risk.

37:15.520 --> 37:17.840
I'm trusting you with
my valuable product.

37:17.960 --> 37:19.000
Risk and reward.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.840
[knocking]

37:23.240 --> 37:25.440
Guys are here with the thing.

37:25.560 --> 37:26.600
Thank you, Des.

37:26.720 --> 37:28.560
Excuse me, girls.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.840
Business to attend to.
I'll be right back.

37:35.160 --> 37:36.960
So, what do you think?

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
I offer you a job andthis is how you repay me?

37:44.120 --> 37:45.560
No idea what
you're talking about.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.680
Des comes to us,something about a suitcase.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.040
That's how you
want to play it.

37:50.160 --> 37:51.240
Do you want the
suitcase or not?

37:51.360 --> 37:52.360
You don't have
a choice in that.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.440
Marty, there's
always a choice.

37:54.560 --> 37:55.600
It's what you
choose that matters.

38:00.120 --> 38:02.080
Des, seeing is it
was you who fucked

38:02.200 --> 38:03.400
up and lost my merchandise.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.560
You didn't take
any for yourself.

38:15.680 --> 38:16.880
I was asked to
bring back a suitcase.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.360
That's all I know about.

38:18.480 --> 38:19.520
Just a minute because someother things were taken.

38:19.640 --> 38:20.880
No idea about
any of that, Des.

38:24.080 --> 38:25.640
I like you, Ted.

38:25.760 --> 38:27.400
I like your style.

38:27.520 --> 38:30.600
Despite all this, the
offer still stands.

38:30.720 --> 38:31.520
Sorry.

38:31.640 --> 38:32.400
Just us girls.

38:38.600 --> 38:40.520
What are you doing here?

38:40.640 --> 38:42.680
Job interview as it turns out.

38:42.800 --> 38:43.800
You?

38:43.920 --> 38:45.120
Same.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.920
I thought I told
you to stay away.

38:47.040 --> 38:47.920
Do you two know each other?

38:48.040 --> 38:49.440
Once upon a time.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.040
It was never a fairy tale.

38:51.160 --> 38:52.960
Look, I don't know what thehell you guys got going on,

38:53.080 --> 38:54.480
but you girls wait
in the office.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.800
No.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.680
Because we're not
your fucking girls

38:57.800 --> 38:59.880
and we don't want anything to dowith your fucked up operation.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.080
That's not entirely--

39:01.200 --> 39:03.640
Shut up, Carol,
I'm saving your life.

39:03.760 --> 39:04.760
Fine, whatever.

39:04.880 --> 39:07.960
Fuck off then.

39:08.080 --> 39:11.160
I hope that when you
do finally go down,

39:11.280 --> 39:13.720
it's one of your girls
that does you in.

39:13.840 --> 39:17.240
And I hope you
never see it coming.

39:17.360 --> 39:18.840
You shouldn't be here.

39:18.960 --> 39:20.160
I'm well aware
of that, thank you.

39:22.840 --> 39:23.600
Come on, Carol.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.560
You got your stuff back.

39:29.680 --> 39:31.040
We square here?

39:31.160 --> 39:33.560
Are you also saying no to me?

39:33.680 --> 39:34.440
Oh hell yes.

39:38.720 --> 39:39.480
Rita.

39:43.600 --> 39:44.400
Hey.

39:47.240 --> 39:48.800
Bilkey will take Carolwherever she needs to go.

39:52.800 --> 39:53.560
You're coming with me.

39:57.120 --> 39:58.680
Since when do you
get to order me around?

39:58.800 --> 40:00.880
It's the bit in the church.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.400
You said love cherish and obey.

40:02.520 --> 40:05.560
From memory, I skipped
over the obey bit.

40:05.680 --> 40:10.320
Well, I definitely said thein sickness and in health bit.

40:10.440 --> 40:11.600
You think I'm sick?

40:11.720 --> 40:13.000
I think you were.

40:13.120 --> 40:14.160
Judging from what
I saw in there,

40:14.280 --> 40:15.120
I reckon you might be better.

40:17.720 --> 40:18.520
Come home with me.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.080
Why?

40:28.200 --> 40:29.640
Why would you want that?

40:29.760 --> 40:34.960
Because despite everything,I love you, the real you.

40:35.080 --> 40:36.440
The you standing up for
your friend in there,

40:36.560 --> 40:38.160
the you standing here now.

40:38.280 --> 40:41.640
Her I fucking love.

40:41.760 --> 40:43.560
Because I can't see my
life without her in it.

40:47.280 --> 40:48.080
What about Wolf?

40:48.200 --> 40:49.480
What about him?

40:49.600 --> 40:50.720
We sit him down.

40:50.840 --> 40:53.320
We tell him there
was this other woman.

40:53.440 --> 40:55.360
It was a long time ago
and she's gone now.

41:03.760 --> 41:06.160
I've done some pretty
bad things lately.

41:06.280 --> 41:08.520
Yeah.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.440
Well, who hasn't?

41:10.560 --> 41:13.080
They were other people andthey don't matter any more.

41:15.720 --> 41:17.560
That doesn't change
the fact that I

41:17.680 --> 41:21.720
love you more than anything.

42:11.800 --> 42:12.720
You better now?

42:17.800 --> 42:19.680
Yeah.

42:19.800 --> 42:24.200
Your father saved me,
just like he saved you.

42:27.360 --> 42:29.720
Are you going
to go away again?

42:29.840 --> 42:31.160
No.

42:31.280 --> 42:32.440
Not if I can help it.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.800
Good.

42:38.920 --> 42:39.680
Oh!

42:44.040 --> 42:44.880
It's OK.

42:49.440 --> 42:52.880
It's OK as long as I've got you.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.960
It's OK.

42:55.080 --> 42:55.880
It's OK, son.

43:00.200 --> 43:03.120
