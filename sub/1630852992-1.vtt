00:06.798 --> 00:08.842
Acting is very much like life.

00:08.926 --> 00:13.222
When you try to get things right in life,
when you try to please everybody else--

00:13.305 --> 00:15.641
I'm trying to please my parents.
I'm trying to please you.

00:15.724 --> 00:18.018
So I'm making the right decision.

00:18.101 --> 00:21.188
But within that,
you're not living your truth,

00:21.271 --> 00:24.650
you're not being open,
you're not being receptive.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.444
If you're just trying to get it right,

00:27.528 --> 00:32.031
what you miss are all the other colors
of what you can get.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.451
- Dear Viola…
- Dear Viola…

00:34.535 --> 00:35.369
Dear Viola…

00:35.452 --> 00:37.204
Your wisdom was
something that I could lean on.

00:37.287 --> 00:41.500
It's still way too common for a Black girl
to be unseen in this life.

00:41.583 --> 00:45.254
Thank you, Viola,
for inspiring me to persevere.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.339
You don't know what's gonna inspire you.

00:47.422 --> 00:50.050
We're messy. We're complicated.

00:50.133 --> 00:53.887
Thank you, Viola,
for giving me passion and drive

00:53.971 --> 00:55.722
beyond anything we could've anticipated.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.474
- Thank you, Viola.
- Thank you, Viola.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.642
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Viola.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.979
For helping me see the beauty
in every single part of myself.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.022
So what are you gonna leave?
What is your voice?

01:05.107 --> 01:09.069
What are you gonna do with that
small dash of time that you have?

01:09.152 --> 01:10.404
Dear Viola…

01:37.973 --> 01:40.893
I was born in South Carolina,

01:40.976 --> 01:44.938
sharecropper's house, 1965, August 11th.

01:45.022 --> 01:48.400
And really,
I was only there for two months

01:48.483 --> 01:52.738
'cause we moved in October of 1965
to Rhode Island

01:52.821 --> 01:55.866
because my father
groomed horses on the racetrack.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.785
Two of the biggest racetracks
were in Rhode Island,

01:58.869 --> 02:01.705
so we settled in Central Falls.

02:01.788 --> 02:07.836
And we were the first Black family
in Central Falls, Rhode Island, 1965.

02:11.215 --> 02:15.469
It was a predominantly Irish-American,
French-American Catholic community,

02:15.552 --> 02:17.888
and here we are coming in,

02:17.971 --> 02:19.640
blacker than black,

02:19.723 --> 02:21.058
coming from the south.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.728
Really competitive,
but at the same time very poor.

02:26.688 --> 02:31.652
And I have wonderful memories
of Central Falls,

02:31.735 --> 02:35.155
of laughter and friendship.

02:35.739 --> 02:41.453
And then I have some not-so-great memories
of being bullied.

02:41.537 --> 02:43.747
Extreme bullying, I thought.

02:43.830 --> 02:48.710
The racial epithets
were just being thrown with impunity.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.004
No one wanted to drink
from the water fountain.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.215
We call it the bubbler in Rhode Island.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.468
Water fountains are those big things
with the statues.

02:57.386 --> 03:00.222
So no one wanted to drink
from the bubbler after me.

03:00.305 --> 03:03.058
They thought I was dirty and filthy and…

03:03.141 --> 03:07.062
And then of course
all the boys chasing me after school.

03:07.145 --> 03:10.607
And they would pick up
the biggest bricks and sticks

03:10.691 --> 03:12.568
and just say, "We're gonna kill you,"

03:12.651 --> 03:14.862
every single day.

03:14.945 --> 03:18.907
And then when you went to the teachers
about it, they never understood it.

03:18.991 --> 03:20.826
So a lot of times I was punished

03:20.909 --> 03:25.497
because, as much as my heart was broken
by all the bullying,

03:25.581 --> 03:28.000
I still had some fight in me.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.794
I still could flip a finger and run.

03:32.462 --> 03:36.592
And then, you know, at home,
I love my mom and dad so much,

03:36.675 --> 03:40.512
but at the time,
we lived in such abject poverty.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.973
You know, the lack of plumbing,

03:43.056 --> 03:45.726
no phone, the rats…

03:45.809 --> 03:49.229
So my way of fighting back
a lot of times was--

03:49.313 --> 03:55.194
One time, I challenged a boy to a race
during recess.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.947
It probably was the beginning
of my life as an actor,

03:59.031 --> 04:02.910
because I wanted an audience
when I beat the crap out of him.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.454
He was the fastest runner
in Central Falls.

04:05.537 --> 04:07.915
Fastest runner.
I said, "He's not the fastest runner.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.958
I'm the fastest runner." You know.

04:10.626 --> 04:14.838
And I remember racing him on the concrete
with my bare feet,

04:14.922 --> 04:16.714
and I remember we tied.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.843
And I mean,
everybody was cheering and everything,

04:19.927 --> 04:23.639
saying "Oh, man. She almost beat you.
She almost beat you."

04:23.722 --> 04:28.602
And the teachers came out, and
they saw that I had no shoes on my feet.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.271
And I got in trouble.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.982
But I remember it being worth it.

04:37.319 --> 04:40.405
So Central Falls was like life.

04:41.073 --> 04:45.077
It was a mixed bag of everything
that was wonderful and adventurous

04:45.160 --> 04:46.453
and everything that wasn't.

04:47.246 --> 04:50.332
So I had the whole spectrum of humanity.

04:50.415 --> 04:54.586
And how I developed my voice
was through acceptance.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.505
The good and the bad.

05:02.094 --> 05:06.139
Dear Viola,
You and I have something in common.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.226
"We both grew up
in Central Falls, Rhode Island.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.563
It's no secret
that Central Falls isn't a rich town."

05:12.646 --> 05:15.774
In fact, the rest of the state
has always seen us

05:15.858 --> 05:17.109
as the lowest of the low.

05:17.860 --> 05:21.154
But where other people looked at us
and saw nothing but poverty,

05:21.238 --> 05:24.825
I, like you, saw a real community.

05:24.908 --> 05:28.287
Dear Viola, I was born and raised
in Central Falls too.

05:28.871 --> 05:31.915
I grew up in a bicultural,
bilingual household.

05:31.999 --> 05:36.336
My parents are from Portugal,
and they came here for the American dream.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.922
Both of my parents are from Colombia.

05:39.006 --> 05:42.342
Like so many other immigrant families,
they ended up here

05:42.426 --> 05:45.679
because they were able to find work
and afford a home.

05:46.930 --> 05:51.894
Growing up, I never felt poor but
knew my family never had a lot of money.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.480
As a kid, I'd watch pageants on TV.

05:56.064 --> 05:59.401
I'd think,
"I wanna be on that stage one day."

05:59.484 --> 06:01.445
But I didn't think it was possible.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.656
My dad always wanted me to go to college.

06:04.740 --> 06:07.784
I remember thinking, "How do I do that?"

06:08.368 --> 06:11.705
I had to figure it out for myself,
and I did.

06:11.788 --> 06:15.959
When I was only 16,
my dad passed away from cancer.

06:20.422 --> 06:23.967
It was devastating emotionally
for me and my family.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.888
And it became devastating financially
as well.

06:32.059 --> 06:35.479
In school,
my teachers took me under their wings.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.273
Your sister, Deloris Grant,
was one of them.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.693
Mrs. Grant used you as an example

06:41.777 --> 06:44.655
and told me not to give up
on the dreams I had.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.574
She encouraged me to go to college

06:47.658 --> 06:51.245
and financially helped me enter
the Miss Rhode Island USA Pageant.

06:52.204 --> 06:57.042
When I graduated from college, I decided
to run for Central Falls City Council.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.211
I was 23 years old.

06:59.294 --> 07:02.548
It was a huge learning curve.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.676
A few years later, a scandal broke.

07:06.677 --> 07:08.971
Central Falls filed for bankruptcy,

07:09.054 --> 07:11.598
and the mayor was indicted
on corruption charges.

07:12.599 --> 07:16.019
My friends knew I wanted to
lead this city in a new direction,

07:16.603 --> 07:18.063
so they said to me,

07:18.146 --> 07:21.149
"This is your time.
You should run for mayor."

07:22.067 --> 07:28.156
I became mayor of Central Falls in 2012
when I was only 27 years old,

07:28.740 --> 07:32.786
the youngest mayor and the first Latino
in our city's history.

07:33.453 --> 07:38.667
Over 60% of the vote. It was unreal.

07:39.376 --> 07:45.132
But soon, the weight of leading a city out
of bankruptcy began to take a toll on me.

07:45.215 --> 07:48.093
I started to doubt myself.

07:48.177 --> 07:51.263
I entered the pageant
three years in a row…

07:51.346 --> 07:53.765
"…but I lost every time.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.727
I honestly felt like I looked pathetic."

07:56.810 --> 08:00.189
I was like, "This is not meant to be."

08:00.272 --> 08:04.318
One night, I remember being wide awake
and freaking out.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.571
How do I revive a city
that's hit rock bottom?

08:07.654 --> 08:11.116
Then I remembered
that exhilarating speech.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.036
I was eight years old
when I decided to be an actor.

08:14.620 --> 08:18.207
You had just won a SAG award
for your role in The Help.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.375
Everyone in Central Falls was inspired.

08:20.459 --> 08:23.086
Because whenever
you were at an award show, Viola,

08:23.170 --> 08:25.088
it was like we were all there.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.673
It was like you were speaking

08:26.757 --> 08:28.258
- directly to me.
- Directly to me.

08:28.342 --> 08:33.179
And I have a special, special note to
the kids in Central Falls, Rhode Island:

08:33.263 --> 08:36.808
to dream big and dream fierce.

08:36.892 --> 08:38.852
Thank you very much.

08:40.437 --> 08:45.275
And you made me realize I too
could make Central Falls a better place.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.529
I started working for Mayor Diossa.

08:48.612 --> 08:52.658
And later, I entered the pageant
for the fourth time.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.618
And this time, I won.

08:55.702 --> 09:00.791
It wasn't easy, but I got us back on track
and turned the city around.

09:01.542 --> 09:05.087
Viola, you were a beacon of hope
for all of us.

09:05.170 --> 09:08.715
And I wanted to do something
to make sure that hope lived on.

09:08.799 --> 09:12.719
That's when I decided I would rename
a street in Central Falls after you.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.181
I chose a street
that leads directly to the high school

09:16.265 --> 09:19.184
so that every day,
kids look up and see your name.

09:19.768 --> 09:23.313
It's important for them to have
a role model from their community.

09:24.147 --> 09:27.943
Now, I'm chief of external affairs
for the mayor of Providence,

09:28.026 --> 09:31.363
and I volunteer to mentor girls
from Central Falls.

09:31.446 --> 09:34.491
Viola, in my eight years as mayor,

09:34.575 --> 09:37.786
you and I have worked together
to improve our community.

09:37.870 --> 09:41.456
This will lead to change
for so many of our young people.

09:42.332 --> 09:45.794
Thank you, Viola,
for inspiring me to persevere

09:45.878 --> 09:49.047
and for teaching me
that you have to lift while you climb.

09:49.131 --> 09:52.426
We all go through things
so we can help other people.

09:52.509 --> 09:55.846
Thank you, Viola,
for showing me and our community

09:55.929 --> 09:58.348
that if we dream big enough
and fierce enough,

09:58.432 --> 10:00.225
we can truly do anything.

10:00.309 --> 10:02.519
"Central Falls for life."

10:10.152 --> 10:16.325
It was my intention from the time
that I was five or six to be great.

10:16.408 --> 10:18.160
Viola! Right down here, please.

10:19.328 --> 10:24.708
At the time,
my dad was really an intense alcoholic,

10:25.542 --> 10:28.420
so there was a lot of domestic violence.

10:30.214 --> 10:32.549
But everything that was going on
with my family

10:32.633 --> 10:35.135
was ripe ground for an artist.

10:35.219 --> 10:39.223
Because as an artist,
you are in the business of empathy.

10:39.306 --> 10:45.145
You are also in the business
of being an observer of life.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.817
My sister Diane, my oldest sister,
when she was nine, I was five,

10:50.901 --> 10:56.198
imparted something
very, very potent in me.

10:57.115 --> 11:01.578
And that is, she asked me
a very powerful question,

11:01.662 --> 11:04.248
which is, "What do you want to be?"

11:05.832 --> 11:12.548
That was the first time I had ever
heard anything like that in my life.

11:13.632 --> 11:18.262
She planted that first seed of,
"You can make your life."

11:19.680 --> 11:23.767
It's amazing once you blow the hole

11:23.851 --> 11:27.646
out of all the negativity
and the pain and the hurt.

11:27.729 --> 11:32.985
And it just has to be a small hole
that lets some level of light in,

11:33.068 --> 11:37.406
and that light becomes just
a huge, huge symbol of hope.

11:39.116 --> 11:43.453
And I wanted to live. I wanted to strive.

11:43.537 --> 11:46.415
I wanted to be somebody.

11:48.917 --> 11:53.422
And then by the time I got to high school,
I discovered theater.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.675
And that's Mr. Aces, Mr. Yates.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.594
And I remember Mr. Yates.

11:58.677 --> 12:02.556
He said,
"Viola, you're really good in this play.

12:02.639 --> 12:06.643
You're so good, you actually
could make a life out of this.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.478
That's how good you are."

12:08.562 --> 12:11.231
And I said, "Really?" He said, "Really.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.443
But you gotta fix some stuff."

12:15.944 --> 12:17.529
But another seed.

12:21.575 --> 12:25.245
I didn't wanna be an actress
'cause I wanted to be a famous actress.

12:25.329 --> 12:30.334
I looked at those people that I felt
had a craft,

12:30.417 --> 12:33.504
and I wanted to do that.

12:34.505 --> 12:38.217
I looked at the Jane Alexanders,
the Cicely Tysons,

12:38.300 --> 12:41.136
the Rosalind Cash, the Mary Alice.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.556
That's why I have
an undergraduate degree in theater.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.142
That's why I went on
to Circle in the Square Theatre.

12:47.226 --> 12:51.855
It's why I went on to Juilliard.
I wanted to be technically proficient.

12:55.108 --> 12:59.446
I did Seven Guitars for a year.
I did King Hedley for six months.

12:59.530 --> 13:03.534
I did Fences for several months.
I did Intimate Apparel.

13:03.617 --> 13:07.746
I've done plays in just about
every state in America.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.540
Broadway, off-Broadway.

13:09.623 --> 13:13.085
I mean, I've gotten on buses,
four hours, one way

13:13.168 --> 13:16.380
to get to the theater
that was in a church basement

13:16.463 --> 13:18.632
because I wanted to work.

13:19.633 --> 13:23.053
And I have to say,
I got better and better.

13:24.096 --> 13:26.181
And more and more powerful.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.184
And more and more light came through.

13:31.895 --> 13:37.109
And because I probably was not considered
"classically beautiful,"

13:37.192 --> 13:40.571
I had to develop what was inside.

13:42.281 --> 13:46.243
I mean, when I was given the role
as Annalise Keating,

13:46.326 --> 13:48.495
I didn't believe that I could do it.

13:48.579 --> 13:51.123
Don't you ever feel
like it's all too hard?

13:51.206 --> 13:54.209
I had Black people and white people,
and they know who they are.

13:54.293 --> 13:58.005
Because they get on that Internet,
and they start typing away,

13:58.088 --> 14:00.215
"She's not classically beautiful enough.

14:00.299 --> 14:03.260
She doesn't know how to walk in shoes.
She's too hard. She's too old.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.304
She's too much of everything."

14:05.387 --> 14:07.389
But what happened was

14:07.472 --> 14:11.768
is I redefined what I felt beautiful was.

14:12.352 --> 14:16.356
I redefined what it means
to be Black and a leading lady.

14:17.399 --> 14:21.612
I rejected everything
that had ever been told about me,

14:21.695 --> 14:24.072
and I never knew that that was an option.

14:24.156 --> 14:26.408
That's how the cycle of abuse works.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.285
So stop judging and do your job.

14:28.994 --> 14:35.584
So I was able to create a character
using my palette, my canvas.

14:35.667 --> 14:39.254
This body, this skin,
this face, this voice.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.548
That's powerful.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.888
Dear Viola,

14:47.971 --> 14:51.350
I grew up in Walnut, California,
the daughter of Nigerian immigrants.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.727
We were one of
the only Black families in town,

14:53.810 --> 14:55.270
so I always knew I was different.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.690
But I was proud of my heritage.

14:58.774 --> 15:02.110
And as a kid, I never placed any value
on the differences

15:02.194 --> 15:03.737
between me and other people.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.741
That all changed
when I hit my preteen years because…

15:08.659 --> 15:10.035
boys.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.789
I remember going to a birthday party
when I was 12.

15:13.872 --> 15:15.624
I was the only Black girl there.

15:15.707 --> 15:18.460
One by one, all of my girlfriends
paired up with a guy

15:18.544 --> 15:21.338
to do their best versions of flirting.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.174
But none of the guys wanted to talk to me.

15:24.258 --> 15:27.469
It was like I was completely invisible
to the opposite sex.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.972
I thought that might change
as I got older,

15:30.055 --> 15:32.850
but it kept happening
all throughout high school as well.

15:33.559 --> 15:37.354
"I decided that there must be
something fundamentally wrong with me,

15:37.437 --> 15:40.065
and I wanted to figure out what it was."

15:42.609 --> 15:44.152
One day at school,

15:44.236 --> 15:47.489
I remember looking at the few
Black girls who were getting attention.

15:47.573 --> 15:50.075
I noticed they all had
two things in common.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.786
They were lighter than me,
and they had long, straight hair.

15:53.745 --> 15:56.456
"Once you notice something like that,
you can't unsee it."

15:56.540 --> 15:57.958
It sticks with you.

15:59.835 --> 16:03.463
I thought I needed to change who I was
in order to be beautiful.

16:03.547 --> 16:07.092
I begged my mom to let me get a wig,
a relaxer or a weave

16:07.176 --> 16:11.263
with the hopes that maybe now
someone would find me beautiful.

16:12.931 --> 16:16.768
Because I believed I would never measure
up to the beauty standards I looked up to,

16:16.852 --> 16:20.105
I leaned into academics, since
that's where I was getting my self-worth.

16:20.189 --> 16:24.985
"And it paid off. I went to Harvard,
where I studied race and gender.

16:25.068 --> 16:29.531
I was excited to finally be a part
of a larger community of Black students."

16:30.115 --> 16:34.536
But then I noticed colorism playing out
in that community as well.

16:36.038 --> 16:40.334
I'd go to the salon and spend money
I didn't have as a broke college student

16:40.417 --> 16:43.378
on wigs, relaxers, extensions.

16:43.462 --> 16:46.507
Post-college,
I continued to struggle with confidence

16:46.590 --> 16:48.634
for the better part of my 20s.

16:48.717 --> 16:53.514
But then in 2014,
How to Get Away with Murder came out.

16:54.223 --> 16:59.353
I got to see a beautiful, Black,
dark-skinned woman on the screen.

16:59.436 --> 17:03.690
Your confidence and self-acceptance
inspired me to look within myself

17:03.774 --> 17:06.902
and think about the parts of me
that I was ashamed of.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.906
"First I had to confront
how I felt about my skin.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.742
That reflection moved me
to speak out on colorism…"

17:14.826 --> 17:17.412
…and its damaging effect
on the self-esteem

17:17.496 --> 17:19.289
of women of color worldwide.

17:19.873 --> 17:24.336
In 2016, I gave a TEDx talk
to raise awareness about the issue

17:24.419 --> 17:27.464
and to inspire women of color
to have self-confidence.

17:27.548 --> 17:32.052
And we don't have to passively accept what
society tells us to think is beautiful.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.679
We can question it.

17:33.762 --> 17:35.639
And we can challenge the status quo.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.475
It's been viewed over a million times.

17:38.559 --> 17:41.770
But there was still
this tiny voice inside me

17:41.854 --> 17:43.772
whispering that I wasn't enough.

17:44.356 --> 17:46.483
And I couldn't quite figure out why.

17:47.484 --> 17:49.778
I was watching your show when it hit me.

17:50.737 --> 17:54.366
Annalise comes home,
takes off her jewelry,

17:54.449 --> 17:56.994
and then takes off her wig.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.745
I couldn't believe it.

17:58.829 --> 18:01.665
You took off your wig
on national television.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.543
It gives me chills just thinking about it.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.087
You're committed
to embracing the parts of us

18:07.171 --> 18:09.798
that society has taught us
to be ashamed of.

18:09.882 --> 18:13.844
And you continue to show Black women
in all our authenticity.

18:15.429 --> 18:18.599
Viola, you helped me
find internal validation

18:18.682 --> 18:20.642
instead of looking for it from a world

18:20.726 --> 18:23.187
that had already given me
very little love.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.397
That's when I decided to do something

18:25.480 --> 18:28.692
that's almost become like
a rite of passage for many of us.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.194
The big chop.

18:31.403 --> 18:34.531
I took my wig off,
cut out all my extensions

18:34.615 --> 18:38.493
until what I had left was all natural,
all mine.

18:38.577 --> 18:42.164
It changed my life, and I owned it.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.587
Because of my TED talk, I was starting
to get more speaking engagements.

18:48.670 --> 18:51.381
So when BET contacted me
to do their speaker series,

18:51.465 --> 18:54.218
I knew exactly
what I was going to talk about.

18:55.385 --> 18:59.473
Finally, I felt fully seen
and accepted for who I am.

18:59.556 --> 19:02.309
Viola, you were able to be authentic,

19:02.392 --> 19:05.395
and you gave me the confidence
to step into my full self.

19:05.479 --> 19:07.356
Now it's my turn.

19:08.482 --> 19:10.692
I'm a public speaker who spreads a message

19:10.776 --> 19:14.238
of self-confidence, self-love
and self-acceptance

19:14.321 --> 19:16.990
to empower women of color
all over the world.

19:17.824 --> 19:18.825
Thank you, Viola,

19:18.909 --> 19:22.663
for helping me see the beauty
in every single part of myself.

19:29.837 --> 19:32.673
I think acting is a noble profession.

19:32.756 --> 19:33.757
I do.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.302
I think that without art in the world,

19:37.386 --> 19:40.848
I think there's a huge part of humanity
that would die.

19:41.932 --> 19:45.561
Do I think it's rocket science? No.
But I do think it's an art form.

19:45.644 --> 19:49.565
And it's an art form
that keeps empathy alive.

19:50.148 --> 19:53.777
My job is to create a human being,

19:53.861 --> 19:57.489
a fully realized human being,
as best as I can

19:57.573 --> 19:59.908
so that you, as an audience,
when you come in,

19:59.992 --> 20:02.661
you recognize some aspect of yourself,

20:02.744 --> 20:05.539
even if it's not a good aspect.

20:06.081 --> 20:08.584
And it makes you feel less alone.

20:09.751 --> 20:11.795
That is a great feeling.

20:11.879 --> 20:16.091
Because as soon as you feel that,
you know you are part of the human family.

20:16.175 --> 20:18.260
You feel a connection to it.

20:18.343 --> 20:23.390
And with me, what's happened with acting
is, it's helped me to heal.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.601
It was my therapy.

20:25.684 --> 20:30.397
The only thing you could do
at the end of the day is have a voice.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.941
And I found mine. You know, thank God.

20:33.025 --> 20:36.195
But what I've experienced
with Black narratives

20:36.278 --> 20:39.573
or narratives
that have people of color in them

20:39.656 --> 20:41.783
is that, you know, when--

20:41.867 --> 20:44.494
A lot of my work has been August Wilson.

20:45.537 --> 20:49.082
A lot of people, I'm just gonna say it,
have an understanding

20:49.166 --> 20:51.960
that if you're just doing Black material,
you're limited.

20:52.044 --> 20:54.171
That's what they said about Toni Morrison.

20:54.254 --> 20:57.633
You're just writing books with
only Black characters, so you're limited.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.384
They don't say that about Chekhov.

20:59.468 --> 21:03.305
They don't say that about white actors
who are just in white movies.

21:03.388 --> 21:08.352
They see them as transformative,
as versatile.

21:09.478 --> 21:15.943
And that's why it's important
to show that we can indeed be excellent.

21:16.693 --> 21:21.615
That we can be craftspeople.
That we're not all just playing ourselves.

21:23.492 --> 21:29.456
So people can then begin to see
our humanity through the Blackness.

21:29.540 --> 21:32.668
The vastness of our humanity
through the Blackness.

21:32.751 --> 21:36.296
The vastness of our femininity
through the Blackness.

21:37.047 --> 21:39.007
And the reason
why it's important for people

21:39.091 --> 21:42.427
to see a symbol of a Black woman
as a standard of excellence

21:42.511 --> 21:45.138
is because usually we're not seen as that.

21:47.224 --> 21:51.770
But I feel that in all that I do,

21:53.105 --> 21:58.360
I'm more and more comfortable
with who I am.

21:58.443 --> 22:02.239
And injecting that into every aspect
of what I do.

22:02.823 --> 22:05.784
Not trying to be anybody else but me.

22:09.663 --> 22:13.417
Dear Viola, I'm a nonbinary,
mixed-race queer slam poet

22:13.500 --> 22:14.543
from Denver, Colorado.

22:14.626 --> 22:17.713
Growing up, I didn't know English
and Spanish were different languages

22:17.796 --> 22:21.091
until I was in preschool, saying,
"Puedes pasarme that red crayon?"

22:21.800 --> 22:23.677
and getting confused looks.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.763
You had to cross two sets of railroads
to get to my house from school.

22:26.847 --> 22:30.267
So no matter where I was, I was always
from the wrong side of the tracks.

22:30.350 --> 22:33.020
I knew myself
as too brown for the white kids,

22:33.103 --> 22:34.813
too blanquito for the brown kids,

22:34.897 --> 22:37.065
and far too queer for my own good.

22:39.401 --> 22:42.404
In undergrad,
I found a reprieve from my own identity

22:42.487 --> 22:44.781
in becoming other people
through the craft of acting.

22:45.490 --> 22:49.036
But in the white walls of academia,
people brown like me,

22:49.119 --> 22:51.705
much less queer like me,
were never represented.

22:52.247 --> 22:54.625
I never saw myself in my textbooks.

22:55.250 --> 22:57.002
"My own work felt bland…"

22:57.085 --> 22:59.588
…and nothing seemed to click for me.

23:01.507 --> 23:05.511
And then, one day in class,
I remember our professor was talking to us

23:05.594 --> 23:08.305
about a facet of acting called eye talk,

23:08.388 --> 23:10.098
the emotions and conversations

23:10.182 --> 23:12.935
that our eyes have
within a given scene or story beat,

23:13.018 --> 23:15.812
while we screened the adaptation
of August Wilson's Fences.

23:16.396 --> 23:19.733
She instructed us to focus on you
not as Rose Maxson,

23:19.816 --> 23:22.694
but as an actor who had refined
and honed the tools of their craft

23:22.778 --> 23:23.820
to surgical precision.

23:23.904 --> 23:26.365
Maybe you ought to go on
and stay down there with her

23:26.448 --> 23:27.699
if she a better woman than me.

23:27.783 --> 23:29.618
You weren't just having eye talk,

23:29.701 --> 23:33.413
you were telling entire stories
with glances, sideways looks,

23:33.497 --> 23:35.666
your gaze piercing
through your scene partner.

23:36.250 --> 23:39.002
In my entire academic career
up to that point,

23:39.086 --> 23:41.380
I had never seen a fellow actor of color
held up…

23:41.463 --> 23:43.757
"…as an example of excellence.

23:43.841 --> 23:45.384
I was blown away."

23:46.093 --> 23:49.179
You made me see that my work
wasn't missing clever wordplay

23:49.263 --> 23:50.722
or interesting plot.

23:50.806 --> 23:52.724
"It was missing the truth.

23:53.892 --> 23:55.561
It was missing me."

23:55.644 --> 23:57.354
None of my characters worked on the page

23:57.437 --> 24:00.732
because I was writing from an experience
that wasn't my own.

24:01.984 --> 24:05.237
Seeing you inject your own truth
into your performance as Rose

24:05.320 --> 24:07.739
inspired me to tell my truth in my writing

24:07.823 --> 24:10.659
and to put in the work to attain
that standard as an actor.

24:13.036 --> 24:14.454
I'm in Hollywood now,

24:14.538 --> 24:17.207
honing my craft at
the Art of Acting Studio during the day

24:17.291 --> 24:19.543
and performing slam poetry at night.

24:21.336 --> 24:24.423
Onstage,
I go by the moniker Pastiche Queen.

24:25.549 --> 24:29.094
A pastiche is defined as a piece of art
derived from many sources.

24:29.178 --> 24:31.972
And folks never have to question
who the queen is.

24:32.055 --> 24:34.600
It puts my mixed-race
and nonbinary identities

24:34.683 --> 24:36.810
at the forefront of every performance

24:36.894 --> 24:39.646
because you showed me
that's where they belong.

24:39.730 --> 24:41.940
You showed me
that the white walls of academia

24:42.024 --> 24:44.818
were not built to sustain
the gale force winds of my ambition.

24:44.902 --> 24:48.822
My pen leaks gasoline
as truth flows from my Technicolor veins.

24:48.906 --> 24:51.658
"The pressure in my heart
turning thoughts and feelings

24:51.742 --> 24:53.660
into diamonds on my tongue.

24:53.744 --> 24:54.745
When I perform…"

24:54.828 --> 24:58.790
…it's the only time you'll hear
someone shout "fire" in a crowded theater.

24:59.374 --> 25:01.376
"And I have you to thank for that.

25:02.503 --> 25:03.795
You awoke in me a drive…"

25:03.879 --> 25:08.008
…and a means to inspire others
like you did for me.

25:08.091 --> 25:11.261
I want them to see me onstage,
representing,

25:11.345 --> 25:13.472
and know that they belong here too.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.182
It's not just an obligation

25:15.265 --> 25:18.602
but a duty bestowed upon me
by your inspiration and example.

25:19.561 --> 25:23.857
Thank you for teaching me that my color
and my queerness are sacred gifts,

25:23.941 --> 25:28.111
and that our own truth,
told a thousand different ways,

25:28.195 --> 25:30.072
can change the world.

25:34.743 --> 25:37.287
And the Oscar goes to Viola Davis.

25:40.082 --> 25:44.127
It's very important to remove barriers
for Black women.

25:44.211 --> 25:49.591
And once again, it goes back
to the conversation about success.

25:52.469 --> 25:57.474
What it's really like being on top is
most people that I know…

25:57.558 --> 25:59.893
I'm gonna just say it--
be bold enough to say it.

25:59.977 --> 26:01.395
They're disillusioned.

26:01.478 --> 26:04.690
They're exhausted. They're stressed out.

26:04.773 --> 26:08.151
And they're disillusioned by the fact
that they thought, "This is it.

26:08.235 --> 26:12.072
I have a life now.
You know, I'm making all this money.

26:12.155 --> 26:13.532
People know my name."

26:13.615 --> 26:15.617
And it's not that.

26:16.326 --> 26:19.997
There's actually an emptiness that ensues.

26:20.080 --> 26:23.458
I became an artist, and thank God I did,

26:23.542 --> 26:29.131
because we are the only profession that
celebrates what it means to live a life.

26:29.214 --> 26:33.135
Even if you get what you want,
you're gonna see the limitations of it…

26:34.553 --> 26:36.930
until you lead a life of significance.

26:37.014 --> 26:38.891
People ask me all the time…

26:40.726 --> 26:44.563
"What kind of stories
do you wanna tell, Viola?"

26:45.272 --> 26:49.902
And I say,
"The stories of the people who dreamed big

26:50.819 --> 26:53.197
and never saw those dreams to fruition."

26:53.280 --> 26:56.825
Your job, your responsibility,
once you hit it,

26:56.909 --> 26:59.995
is to create those opportunities

27:00.078 --> 27:03.123
that will give other artists of color

27:03.207 --> 27:06.585
the opportunity to showcase their work.

27:06.668 --> 27:07.878
That's your power.

27:07.961 --> 27:10.797
And I tried to even do that
with my production company.

27:10.881 --> 27:14.551
I really am very, very aware
how I am fighting.

27:15.511 --> 27:21.391
That's all we have.
Is the power of diversifying our success.

27:21.475 --> 27:24.770
Because if it's just afforded
to one of us,

27:24.853 --> 27:26.897
then it's not gonna change anything.

27:26.980 --> 27:29.650
So we need to spread the wealth.

27:30.150 --> 27:36.740
It is through human dedication and effort
that we move forward.

27:36.823 --> 27:41.036
When you are a part of a group
that is on the periphery,

27:41.119 --> 27:44.581
that has been disenfranchised,
that's been underrepresented,

27:44.665 --> 27:48.544
then it is your job to make that less true

27:48.627 --> 27:50.629
by the time you leave the room.

27:56.385 --> 28:00.222
Dear Viola, I was born in the US
but grew up in Lagos, Nigeria,

28:00.305 --> 28:01.932
in a relatively privileged family.

28:02.516 --> 28:06.728
Nigeria is a beautiful country, but it can
be quite patriarchal and conservative.

28:07.646 --> 28:09.565
As a child, I'd see girls on the street

28:09.648 --> 28:11.775
who couldn't afford
to go to school like I did.

28:12.442 --> 28:13.986
"I remember asking my mom,

28:14.069 --> 28:17.281
'How is it that
I was born into this family

28:17.364 --> 28:19.366
and have things other girls don't?'"

28:20.659 --> 28:24.329
Five years ago, I came back to the States
to go to college at Brown.

28:24.413 --> 28:27.875
I'd always had this romanticized idea
of the American dream.

28:27.958 --> 28:32.254
I felt like if I could make it to America,
I'd make it for real.

28:32.337 --> 28:33.589
But my freshman year,

28:33.672 --> 28:37.843
I found the experience of being a Black
woman in this country very confusing.

28:37.926 --> 28:41.054
It was like this trippy combination
of being invisible

28:41.138 --> 28:43.765
yet hyper-visible at the same time.

28:44.558 --> 28:46.768
I struggled in adjusting
to this new reality

28:46.852 --> 28:48.729
and often felt out of place.

28:48.812 --> 28:52.107
But one huge source of comfort
came on Thursday nights

28:52.191 --> 28:54.943
when my friends and I would watch
How to Get Away with Murder.

28:55.027 --> 28:58.906
Every week, without fail,
we'd sneak into a classroom

28:58.989 --> 29:03.202
and project the show on one of those
huge screens and just revel.

29:03.285 --> 29:06.079
When I found out you were coming
to Brown to speak, I was like,

29:06.163 --> 29:09.249
"She's the queen of Thursday night.
I have to go see her."

29:10.375 --> 29:12.169
I remember how you commanded the room.

29:12.878 --> 29:17.883
You owned your story masterfully,
as beautiful and painful as it was.

29:18.550 --> 29:20.135
But your lecture was a light.

29:20.219 --> 29:24.681
"You spoke about how so much of success,
especially for young women of color…"

29:24.765 --> 29:27.392
…is really about access
or removing barriers

29:27.476 --> 29:29.478
so young women can pursue their dreams.

29:29.561 --> 29:31.980
It made me think about how, in Nigeria…

29:32.064 --> 29:34.608
"…many girls have to miss school
when they get their periods

29:34.691 --> 29:36.944
because they can't afford pads.

29:39.404 --> 29:41.031
For most of the people in that room,

29:41.114 --> 29:42.449
it was a great opportunity…"

29:42.533 --> 29:44.451
…to see and hear an amazing artist.

29:44.535 --> 29:48.455
But for me as a Black woman
searching for my place in the world,

29:48.539 --> 29:50.123
it was an epiphany.

29:50.207 --> 29:52.167
Literally life-changing.

29:52.251 --> 29:55.879
You ignited a fire in me.
A responsibility to do more.

29:56.630 --> 30:00.092
I started thinking,
"What will I be remembered as?"

30:01.009 --> 30:04.388
I wanted to be a changemaker
for my generation.

30:06.515 --> 30:09.935
So when I saw the opportunity to connect
with six other Nigerian women

30:10.018 --> 30:13.188
who were just as passionate as I was
about uplifting our sisters,

30:13.272 --> 30:15.315
I thought, "This is it."

30:15.399 --> 30:18.944
Together, we founded
Sanitary Aid for Nigerian Girls.

30:19.528 --> 30:20.863
For the past three years,

30:20.946 --> 30:25.409
we've given out free sanitary pads
to women and girls throughout Nigeria.

30:25.492 --> 30:28.161
Eventually, we want to build
a manufacturing facility

30:28.245 --> 30:30.205
that employs Nigerian women.

30:30.289 --> 30:33.375
We're also planning to extend our work
to include feminine health education

30:33.458 --> 30:35.544
and lobbying for women's rights.

30:36.587 --> 30:41.341
We want Nigerian women to love themselves,
their bodies, their dreams, their power.

30:41.925 --> 30:45.220
Because we saw it in our mothers.
We saw it in our grandmothers.

30:46.597 --> 30:50.642
This project sets my soul on fire,
and this is only the beginning.

30:51.393 --> 30:54.605
Thank you, Viola,
for being the bold, courageous catalyst

30:54.688 --> 30:58.317
that inspired me to use my privilege
to become a changemaker

30:58.400 --> 31:02.487
for a growing family of girls and women
in the country that gave me life.

31:09.620 --> 31:13.081
The only thing
that you then have is a legacy.

31:13.957 --> 31:16.752
Now that, there is some payoff.

31:17.878 --> 31:23.717
Because it's about giving
and leaving something behind

31:23.800 --> 31:29.181
for other people to experience
that is a part of you.

31:29.765 --> 31:32.309
That it's your way of living forever.

31:33.143 --> 31:37.564
And your way of living a life
that is meaningful.

31:37.648 --> 31:39.525
Thank you, Viola,

31:39.608 --> 31:41.818
for showing me that
we must rise to our own occasion.

31:41.902 --> 31:45.614
I try to inspire others
the way you inspired me.

31:45.697 --> 31:47.783
Thank you, Viola.

31:47.866 --> 31:49.993
Yours truly, Chika.

31:50.077 --> 31:52.120
- Theresa.
- Mayor James Diossa.

31:52.204 --> 31:54.790
All my best, Alexa.

31:54.873 --> 31:57.960
Sincerely, Dan.

31:58.043 --> 32:02.130
What you leave on this Earth
in terms of the experience people have

32:02.214 --> 32:03.674
when they're in your presence,

32:03.757 --> 32:07.761
whatever you've created for them
to benefit from,

32:07.845 --> 32:09.888
that's gonna keep your name,

32:09.972 --> 32:12.808
and really who you're about

32:14.101 --> 32:16.103
is gonna keep that alive.
