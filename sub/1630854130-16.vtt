at the crime scene.

02:19.661 --> 02:22.228

and forensics on this gun?

02:22.272 --> 02:23.665
- Yes.

02:23.708 --> 02:26.276
Ballistics on that 9-millimeter
were a match

02:26.320 --> 02:29.497
for the bullet found
in Tom Villar's skull.

dried blood spatter

02:32.326 --> 02:35.111

And tell you congratulations.

39:45.470 --> 39:46.993
You should be proud.

39:49.822 --> 39:52.520
- Yeah, I should be.

39:52.564 --> 39:56.698
I thought I would,
that I would feel relief.

39:56.742 --> 39:58.613
Hell, I thought you and I
would be out grabbing a drink,

39:58.657 --> 40:01.573
celebrating, right now.

40:01.616 --> 40:05.577
But instead I'm here

40:05.620 --> 40:09.668
wondering how
I'm complicit with you,

40:09.711 --> 40:12.322
wondering how
an innocent woman almost died.

40:12.366 --> 40:15.369
- Nina...

40:15.413 --> 40:18.416
I did what I had to do.

40:18.459 --> 40:20.418
- How the hell
do you know that?

40:20.461 --> 40:23.246
- Because Julia is alive,

40:23.290 --> 40:26.685
and you just put Morales away
for life.

40:26.728 --> 40:28.904
- Should I be
thanking you, then?

40:28.948 --> 40:31.733
For lying to me,
for doing God knows what

40:31.777 --> 40:33.300
to get the right result?

40:35.737 --> 40:37.435
- All right.

40:37.478 --> 40:38.784
- That's it?

40:40.786 --> 40:43.919
- Yeah, that's it.

40:49.621 --> 40:54.234
- Remember when you said
you don't think about it?

40:54.277 --> 40:56.758
About the kind of man
you are now?

40:58.543 --> 41:00.588
You should.
