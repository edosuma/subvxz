00:00.800 --> 00:02.760
Previously on damages...

00:04.130 --> 00:07.410
We found her prints and her
fianc?s blood on the murder weapon.

00:07.420 --> 00:10.140
Ellen parsons,you're under arrest
for the murder of david connor.

00:10.150 --> 00:12.190
Hollis nye said you wanted to see me.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.950
I need you to find patty.

00:13.960 --> 00:14.980
Nobody knows where she is.

00:14.990 --> 00:17.330
Mr.Nye,tom just left.

00:17.340 --> 00:18.830
Stay on him.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.090
He'll lead you to patty.

00:22.930 --> 00:24.610
We had our first fight.

00:24.620 --> 00:27.850
You and david need to take some
time together. You're both so busy.

00:27.860 --> 00:30.850
They're good,hardworking people,and
they're afraid of losing you.

00:30.860 --> 00:32.520
You try to lead by example.

00:32.530 --> 00:35.470
And they want you to lead,and
then they resent you for it.

00:35.480 --> 00:38.650
Looks like our boy gregory malina's
going to be deposed after all.

00:38.660 --> 00:44.400
I am not going to let your young friend sit across
a table from patty hewes and face an inquisition.

00:44.410 --> 00:47.710
Your witness has other priorities.

00:47.720 --> 00:48.710
I lost him.

00:48.720 --> 00:49.740
Then find him.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.650
I think that you and I
together could end this.

00:52.660 --> 00:54.480
Let's stick to our plan.

00:54.490 --> 00:57.470
Take this money and
get on with our lives.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.420
Your cooperation has been invaluable.

01:01.430 --> 01:04.030
I want to double our arrangement.

01:20.090 --> 01:21.280
You still didn't make new keys.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.760
Oh,there's no time.

01:23.780 --> 01:26.440
- Your sister was going to bring over the extra set
- but She didn'T.

01:26.450 --> 01:28.880
I'm so ...

01:34.250 --> 01:37.190
Whoa,what is this?

01:37.420 --> 01:41.490
The cake lady sent them
over for the wedding.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.060
We have to choose?

01:44.680 --> 01:48.890
But I gotta go,so whatever you like is
great with me-- just nothing too lemony.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.550
Wait.No,no!I'm not deciding.

01:51.560 --> 01:52.300
Why not?

01:52.310 --> 01:56.040
Because I'm the guy.
I don't give a shit.

01:58.250 --> 02:00.440
Okay,fine,fair enough.

02:04.910 --> 02:07.740
Oh,this one. It's great.

02:11.380 --> 02:13.660
David!

02:29.670 --> 02:32.410
****

02:32.840 --> 02:35.190
What happened*******

02:36.620 --> 02:38.470
David and I had...

02:40.550 --> 02:42.350
Take your time.

02:45.550 --> 02:47.600
David and I had a fight.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.420
I don't know what you're doing anymore.

02:52.430 --> 02:53.870
I know exactly what I'm doing.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.730
Oh,really? A man's dead now.

02:55.740 --> 02:56.750
Was that the plan?

02:56.760 --> 02:58.230
This is what it takes.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.190
I don't want this life.

03:00.200 --> 03:04.540
You decide right now-- do you
want us or do you want this job?

03:05.350 --> 03:07.570
- Please don't do this.
- Right now.

03:09.630 --> 03:11.860
Right... now!

03:14.400 --> 03:16.110
You can't decide,can you?

03:16.120 --> 03:17.610
David?

03:17.620 --> 03:20.270
No. No.

03:21.110 --> 03:23.480
We're done,ellen.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.620
Bye,michael. Bye,mom.

05:05.010 --> 05:08.210
First family breakfast in over a year.

05:47.990 --> 05:50.480
We can't find gregory malina.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.030
Patty?

05:55.290 --> 05:56.720
What,tom?

05:56.730 --> 05:59.860
There's a court order
for gregory to appear.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.030
Useless.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.910
The police will never find him.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.860
Either he's in hiding or he's dead.

06:05.870 --> 06:09.010
Either way,we have
to plan our next move.

06:12.860 --> 06:14.130
Yeah?

06:14.140 --> 06:17.090
Ms.Hewes,one of the client
reps is here to see you.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.110
Who?

06:18.120 --> 06:19.800
Peter hassett.

06:19.810 --> 06:21.560
Send him in.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.500
What are you going to tell him?

06:24.510 --> 06:26.710
I'll tell him the truth.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.280
Without gregory malina,we're
going to lose the case.

06:33.210 --> 06:36.570
Peter have a sit

06:47.900 --> 06:51.010
Larry,come here for a second,will you?

06:51.020 --> 06:52.100
Kevin,hey!

06:52.110 --> 06:54.080
Hey,you ding up a caddy this morning?

06:54.090 --> 06:55.100
Did I what?

06:55.110 --> 06:57.920
Got a guy in there saying
his door's all scratched up.

06:58.630 --> 06:59.580
Yes or no?

06:59.590 --> 07:03.970
If it's the guy I'm thinking
of,they may have been there before.

07:03.980 --> 07:06.360
The brushes have to be replaced,kevin.

07:06.370 --> 07:07.620
I've been telling you that.

07:07.630 --> 07:09.650
It's not the brushes,larry.

07:09.660 --> 07:10.900
Manny doesn't have these issues.

07:10.910 --> 07:12.000
Neither does wanda.

07:12.010 --> 07:16.470
Wanda wears jeans that let her patooty
show,is why nobody complains about her.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.900
And manny just got fired.

07:17.910 --> 07:19.730
Manny just graduated high school.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.290
He gave notice and left for college.

07:21.300 --> 07:23.200
Is this about me being more careful?

07:23.210 --> 07:24.970
Larry,I can't keep covering for you.

07:24.980 --> 07:26.650
At this point,my ass is on the line.

07:27.420 --> 07:28.870
I gotta make a change.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.820
You're firing me?

07:30.830 --> 07:33.500
My daughter went to prom with
you,I drove you there myself.

07:33.510 --> 07:34.650
That was 20 years ago.

07:34.660 --> 07:38.320
Look,I tried to do you a favor
here,and it just didn't work out,okay?

07:38.830 --> 07:41.860
Turn your shirt in to gloria,and
I'll pay you for the week.

07:42.620 --> 07:44.510
I'm sorry.

07:51.590 --> 07:52.720
Ellen?

07:52.730 --> 07:53.250
Yeah?

07:53.260 --> 07:54.620
So I called your parents.

07:54.630 --> 07:55.950
They were already on their way.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.660
But you told them i couldn't have lunch.

07:57.670 --> 08:00.190
Uh,not really. What?

08:00.200 --> 08:01.960
Well,they wouldn't cancel.

08:02.160 --> 08:05.350
Okay,in the future when I'm unavailable,you
just need to explain it to them.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.230
Say I'm with a client or in a meeting.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.520
I know. I'm sorry.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.320
I should have said that.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.250
Uh,you asked for me?

08:13.260 --> 08:16.420
Yeah,the paralegals have
finished annotating the sec memos.

08:16.430 --> 08:18.970
I'd like you to review
them and report to tom.

08:18.980 --> 08:20.250
Uh,what am i looking for?

08:20.260 --> 08:24.130
Inconsistencies,anything
that even hints at a red flag.

08:24.330 --> 08:26.020
Would you pull the files,please?

08:26.030 --> 08:27.530
Right away.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.390
Anything else?

08:29.890 --> 08:32.100
How's your new assistant working out?

08:32.110 --> 08:34.820
It's a little bumpy,but he'll catch on.

08:34.830 --> 08:36.650
I don't like him.

08:41.370 --> 08:43.720
That's all. Get to work.

08:53.980 --> 08:56.140
Hey! There he is!

08:56.150 --> 08:57.290
Mr.Frobisher.

08:57.300 --> 08:58.490
Good to see you,larry.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.620
Hey,you need breakfast?
You want an omelet?

09:00.630 --> 09:01.320
No?

09:01.330 --> 09:03.630
I'll tell you something,we
got some great lemonade here.

09:03.640 --> 09:06.160
No,thank you,mr.Frobisher.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.180
Sit down,please.

09:09.070 --> 09:11.390
I get famished after racquetball.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.960
It's a great workout.

09:12.970 --> 09:15.170
A lot more exciting than
tennis,too,I'll tell you.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.060
You play?

09:16.070 --> 09:17.180
Bowling was my game.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.900
Oh,yeah,yeah.

09:18.910 --> 09:22.030
Once hit a 900 series in league play.

09:22.040 --> 09:25.220
But you know,i haven't been
out since my eyes started to go.

09:25.590 --> 09:28.970
These days,I couldn't even
pick up a two-pin spare.

09:28.980 --> 09:31.660
Exactly. Exactly.

09:32.510 --> 09:35.420
So,sorry about that.
What can I do for you?

09:35.430 --> 09:38.600
I'm going to be direct with
you,mr.Frobisher. Please.

09:38.610 --> 09:40.240
We had a deal.

09:40.620 --> 09:41.310
I know that.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.160
I got the employees to vote
for your settlement offer.

09:44.170 --> 09:47.950
I tried to get 'em to fire mrs.
Hewes,I did everything you asked me to.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.210
Yes,you did.

09:49.220 --> 09:51.570
You said I'd be taken care of.

09:52.150 --> 09:54.390
And after the trial,you will be.

09:54.400 --> 09:57.330
That could be a year from
now. I can't wait that long.

09:57.820 --> 10:00.900
Larry,I was very clear about that.

10:00.910 --> 10:04.490
You said you were going
to double our arrangement.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.740
All right,yeah,tell you what I'll do.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.460
I'm gonna call my people,all right?

10:11.470 --> 10:13.740
We'll see if we can get
something set up for you here.

10:13.750 --> 10:16.980
In the meantime,keep doing
what you're doing,all right?

10:16.990 --> 10:19.900
We're gonna get through
this... together.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.190
Ellen... they're here.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.350
Who is?

10:26.360 --> 10:28.110
Your parents.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.320
- What did she bring?
- Muffins.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.010
I think they're for you.

10:37.390 --> 10:38.130
Honey!

10:39.440 --> 10:42.140
I assumed the office was nice,but geez!

10:43.580 --> 10:45.100
Hi,dad. Hey.

10:45.830 --> 10:48.520
My assistant called,right,told
you I couldn't make lunch?

10:48.530 --> 10:50.670
Yeah,I was a little surprised
you didn't call us yourself.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.540
- We had a plan.
- I know.

10:52.550 --> 10:55.600
- Let me make it up to you later
this week,I-I promise. - Yeah.

10:55.610 --> 10:58.250
Uh,ellen,we have to talk.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.030
What's wrong?

11:00.040 --> 11:03.130
Uh... we were in a car accident.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.590
Oh,my G... are you okay?

11:04.600 --> 11:06.480
It was a month ago. We're fine.

11:06.490 --> 11:09.290
But,uh,I hit a crossing guard.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.480
Outside a school.

11:13.740 --> 11:16.100
Oh... um... was he hurt?

11:16.110 --> 11:18.720
She. Linda reynolds.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.740
Linda broke her hip.

11:20.750 --> 11:22.590
She had surgery at hudson general.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.860
When? Two weeks ago.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.250
Uh... he wouldn't let me call you.

11:27.260 --> 11:30.060
You're busy. I-I didn't
want you to worry.

11:30.070 --> 11:32.300
We have insurance.

11:32.310 --> 11:35.310
I,uh... I met with the
lawyer from the company.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.420
And?

11:36.430 --> 11:38.670
These guys are sleazeballs.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.440
Lady's in the hospital,all
they care about is bottom line.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.040
Dad,what did the lawyer say?

11:43.050 --> 11:45.240
I've got it under control.

11:45.630 --> 11:47.970
My deposition is tomorrow afternoon.

11:48.280 --> 11:49.420
Tomorrow?

11:49.430 --> 11:50.780
I told him.

11:50.790 --> 11:53.120
Your daughter's a successful
attorney-- talk to her.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.940
It's under control,denise.

11:54.950 --> 11:57.810
Okay,just tell me what happened.

11:58.140 --> 12:01.820
We were headed to your sister's,I
made a crack about your brother-in-law,

12:01.830 --> 12:03.170
and your mother got angry.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.750
What does that have to do with it?

12:04.760 --> 12:06.790
We were arguing when i hit the guard.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.800
So it's my fault?

12:07.810 --> 12:10.480
- No,I'm just saying we were fighting...
- Ellen?

12:10.500 --> 12:11.910
...And maybe that's why I...

12:11.920 --> 12:13.980
Um,patty wants to see you.

12:14.540 --> 12:17.880
I want to talk about this
more,so just-just wait here,okay?

12:17.890 --> 12:19.470
We have to go to the hospital.

12:19.480 --> 12:20.370
What for?

12:20.380 --> 12:21.720
To say hello.

12:21.730 --> 12:23.220
I told linda we'd stop by.

12:23.230 --> 12:26.230
- Your mother made muffins.
- No.No,no.

12:26.290 --> 12:27.640
You don't give her anything.

12:27.650 --> 12:28.850
I'll explain when I get back.

12:28.860 --> 12:31.750
Please,just wait in my office.

12:34.230 --> 12:36.360
Aw,for crying out loud.

12:37.320 --> 12:43.340
You know... I just don't understand
how we could win at trial,mrs.Hewes,

12:43.350 --> 12:46.430
unless you got something
you're not telling us.

12:47.170 --> 12:51.530
The truth is,we may never get to trial.

12:52.630 --> 12:54.680
Then what the hell are you doing?

12:54.690 --> 12:59.370
Larry,I can't imagine the pressure
you must be under these days.

12:59.710 --> 13:01.910
No. You can'T.

13:02.530 --> 13:05.330
How many years did you
work for mr.Frobisher?

13:07.850 --> 13:09.390
That's right.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.610
And nothing to show for it.

13:11.620 --> 13:16.440
In a litigation like this,every
move we make has a purpose.

13:16.450 --> 13:20.570
Pushing for a trial is also how
we get a higher settlement offer.

13:20.910 --> 13:22.190
So you'd be willing to settle.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.310
Well,I-I don't want to.

13:24.320 --> 13:28.100
But if frobisher's people
came up with a fair offer,

13:28.110 --> 13:32.040
I'd have to advise you all
to seriously consider it.

13:32.050 --> 13:34.190
What's fair?

13:34.200 --> 13:38.690
After losing gregory
malina,I'd like to go in at...

13:39.160 --> 13:41.520
$350,$400 million.

13:41.530 --> 13:45.540
But it's a negotiation,and
at this point,

13:45.550 --> 13:50.970
we might have to
accept as little as 175.

13:51.670 --> 13:52.620
175?

13:52.630 --> 13:55.380
Only as a last resort.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.690
Makes sense.

13:59.480 --> 14:06.310
In the meantime,larry,I need you
to be supportive of our efforts.

14:06.830 --> 14:08.660
Patty's willing to settle now.

14:08.670 --> 14:09.730
I doubt it.

14:09.740 --> 14:11.830
Popler has got a lot of
sway with the client reps.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.820
I'm sure she's just
trying to get him on board.

14:13.830 --> 14:15.770
You didn't fire him yet?

14:16.770 --> 14:18.600
Why would I do that?

14:18.610 --> 14:19.870
Well,patty wants you to.

14:19.880 --> 14:20.830
She didn't say that.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.690
She said she didn't like him.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.210
And that means...?

14:24.220 --> 14:26.590
Get rid of him.

14:30.710 --> 14:31.920
Sec files?

14:31.930 --> 14:33.520
Yes.Yep.

14:33.530 --> 14:34.850
This is... it.

14:34.860 --> 14:37.580
You brought me everything from 1998?

14:38.230 --> 14:39.420
1998?

14:39.430 --> 14:43.110
Yeah,I need everything from the
beginning of the sec investigation.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.310
Not just the trial.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.750
Sorry.

14:49.390 --> 14:51.230
Where did my parents go?

14:51.960 --> 14:55.990
Your dad said something about
a woman in the hospital,so...

15:03.950 --> 15:06.310
Parsons!Let's go.

15:06.750 --> 15:08.700
Your attorney's here.

15:11.730 --> 15:15.090
Turn around and face the wall.
Put your hands behind your back.

15:18.340 --> 15:20.410
And then you'll enter your plea.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.690
Did you contact my parents?

15:21.700 --> 15:23.030
They're on their way.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.280
And patty?

15:24.290 --> 15:26.250
We can't find her.

15:26.260 --> 15:29.630
But we're still watching tom shayes.

15:42.180 --> 15:44.320
Ellen parsons.

15:50.760 --> 15:56.010
Six-percent grade,fast
greens,breaks to the left.

15:56.390 --> 15:59.630
It's all about focus and concentration.

15:59.640 --> 16:04.630
As much as I wish this case could
be decided by your short game,

16:04.640 --> 16:08.080
we've got a deposition
to prepare you for.

16:09.010 --> 16:12.810
I've gone through your transcripts
from the government trial,

16:12.820 --> 16:18.790
and there are a couple of areas...
I feel we can handle better.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.070
You think I gave away too much?

16:21.080 --> 16:26.010
I'd like to bring in a specialist,help
prepare you for the deposition.

16:26.020 --> 16:30.360
Patty hewes's whole case
now is about tripping you up.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.220
Let's do it.

16:32.230 --> 16:36.380
Get us a barracuda. Get us the toughest
son-of-a-btich attorney you can find.

16:36.750 --> 16:38.840
But I'm telling you something,ray.

16:39.850 --> 16:42.060
She's scared,man.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.190
She's losing her confidence.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.880
What makes you think so?

16:45.890 --> 16:49.820
I have it on good authority
that she's willing to settle.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.280
Whose authority?

16:52.290 --> 16:55.480
$175 million is what it would cost.

16:55.490 --> 16:59.320
A few weeks ago,this woman
was,like,gung ho for a trial,right?

16:59.330 --> 17:00.570
She's scared,man.

17:00.580 --> 17:03.290
What do you mean,on good authority?

17:03.300 --> 17:06.510
No,don't worry about it.It's just...

17:08.730 --> 17:11.020
Jesus,no.

17:11.030 --> 17:11.950
What?

17:11.960 --> 17:14.589
Art? Art?

17:15.540 --> 17:19.319
Don't tell me you've been
talking to someone on the inside.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.849
Look,he's A... he's a good guy,ray.

17:21.859 --> 17:24.319
He's a straight shooter.

17:24.329 --> 17:27.220
You know something,we should
be showing him some gratitude.

17:27.230 --> 17:31.770
Seriously,I want you to,you know,get
him set up with some account,you know?

17:31.780 --> 17:34.310
Uh,offshore,however we do that.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.190
Absolutely not!

17:36.200 --> 17:38.520
Who knows about this?

17:38.530 --> 17:39.720
No one.

17:39.730 --> 17:42.290
You haven't paid him anything,have you?

17:42.300 --> 17:44.110
I gave him my word,ray.

17:44.120 --> 17:48.630
All right,in no uncertain
terms,I am telling you...

17:48.640 --> 17:51.390
to shut this down!

17:51.400 --> 17:57.010
Never again are you to have contact
with this man,under any circumstances!

17:57.020 --> 18:02.570
Arthur... you can go to jail for this.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.820
You understand?

18:05.170 --> 18:06.900
No more.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.480
All right.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.150
I understand.

18:27.700 --> 18:29.820
175?

18:37.230 --> 18:39.600
Well,isn't this a swell picture.

18:39.610 --> 18:40.810
What,ray?

18:40.820 --> 18:43.190
Your little precious never takes a shit?

18:43.750 --> 18:46.930
I wish i caught you in a better mood.

18:46.940 --> 18:48.610
I'm fine.

18:48.620 --> 18:54.550
Well,then perhaps you'd care to
humor me for a moment,off the record.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.120
I'm listening.

18:56.130 --> 18:59.820
Understand,I'm not authorized.

18:59.830 --> 19:01.070
I'm making no promises.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.230
I'm not taking any.

19:03.850 --> 19:06.820
My client pulled his
offer of a hundred million.

19:06.830 --> 19:12.460
What if I could get him to
reconsider,maybe even sweeten the pot a bit?

19:12.940 --> 19:15.080
Why would he do that?

19:15.090 --> 19:18.160
- Let's you and I do the math here,patty.
- 'Kay.

19:18.170 --> 19:20.160
All right,here's what you've got.

19:20.180 --> 19:26.280
A billionaire who the public already
believes is corrupt,whether he is or isn'T.

19:26.780 --> 19:27.640
He is.

19:27.650 --> 19:29.650
And here's what I got.

19:29.660 --> 19:35.350
No smoking-gun witness or any credible
evidence that my client did anything wrong.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.590
You're sure about that?

19:38.020 --> 19:42.580
It's a draw,patty,and we both know it.

19:43.200 --> 19:47.910
Now,we go in that courtroom,we
might as well flip a coin.

19:49.320 --> 19:54.290
Is that any way for two
old friends to do business?

19:54.300 --> 19:56.230
What's your number?

19:57.050 --> 20:01.110
Well,I'm not saying i could
go as high as 200,but...

20:01.120 --> 20:03.480
But in the ballpark?

20:04.100 --> 20:10.250
Oh,we're just talking
here,but I think 150...

20:11.070 --> 20:13.260
would probably get you a deal.

20:13.820 --> 20:17.400
Maybe even... 175.

20:30.750 --> 20:34.500
- So...
- Was I right about larry?

20:34.860 --> 20:36.310
Yes,peter.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.970
Mr.Popler's leaking
information to frobisher's camp.

20:39.980 --> 20:41.590
How do you know?

20:41.600 --> 20:44.470
I gave him 175 as a settlement number.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.460
Ray fiske brought it right back to me.

20:49.350 --> 20:51.350
So what are you going to do?

20:51.360 --> 20:55.230
Unfortunately,we don't have the
evidence to use this against frobisher.

20:55.380 --> 20:58.570
There won't be a paper
trail,money exchanged.

20:58.580 --> 21:02.380
I think the best thing to
do right now is nothing.

21:02.760 --> 21:05.240
We'll keep an eye on larry.

21:05.250 --> 21:09.210
In the meantime,let's not mention
this to the other client reps.

21:09.220 --> 21:14.300
Our investigators are trying to locate gregory
malina since he skipped out on his deposition.

21:14.310 --> 21:18.370
Unfortunately,mr.Malina
seems to have disappeared.

21:18.380 --> 21:19.880
So that's it?

21:19.890 --> 21:21.420
We don't have his testimony?

21:21.430 --> 21:24.510
Relax,larry. Just let them talk.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.020
Of course,we're still looking for him,

21:26.030 --> 21:27.890
but once someone leaves the state...

21:27.900 --> 21:31.950
How the hell does a witness
just up and disappear?

21:34.890 --> 21:37.650
I think you all should
know what we're up against.

21:37.660 --> 21:43.040
We have reason to believe that mr.Malina's
life was threatened prior to the deposition.

21:43.050 --> 21:46.750
It's quite possible that
the other side got to him.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.740
What are you saying?

21:48.750 --> 21:51.310
He's been killed?

21:51.320 --> 21:55.720
We're seriously looking
into that possibility,yes.

22:09.840 --> 22:14.260
**********

22:14.270 --> 22:17.600
I've been leaving messages
all week.Call me back.

22:18.290 --> 22:20.320
We got to get going here.

22:20.330 --> 22:24.250
So,call me back.

22:24.260 --> 22:27.910
Larry,dinner's ready.

22:32.410 --> 22:35.310
You think they killed this gregory guy?

22:36.600 --> 22:38.780
We don't know.

22:42.350 --> 22:45.410
He never tried to call
katie again,did he?

22:45.420 --> 22:47.300
No.

22:48.940 --> 22:51.010
No,just that once.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.810
- Ellen,if this is true...
- I know.

23:05.250 --> 23:08.170
Thank you guys for showing
up. I appreciate that.

23:08.180 --> 23:09.810
See you tomorrow.

23:11.620 --> 23:14.500
Oh,boy.Take me home,man.

23:14.510 --> 23:16.580
Did you kill that kid?

23:17.780 --> 23:19.300
What?

23:19.310 --> 23:21.880
What kind of man are you?

23:24.840 --> 23:27.210
What the hell are you talking about?

23:27.220 --> 23:32.570
That witness-- gregory malina--
patty hewes says he was knocked off.

23:32.580 --> 23:33.940
Oh,for christ's sake.

23:33.950 --> 23:36.800
How many times I got to tell
you,that woman is crazy,larry.

23:36.810 --> 23:39.100
I don'T... I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:39.110 --> 23:41.550
I don't know any gregory malina.

23:41.560 --> 23:42.930
What's the matter with you?

23:42.940 --> 23:44.640
I've been calling you all week.

23:44.650 --> 23:46.710
All right,just relax,will you?

23:46.720 --> 23:51.090
It's late. Can't we do
this tomorrow,please?

23:51.800 --> 23:53.140
I need my money!

23:53.150 --> 23:55.630
- Sir,I need you to stand back.
- Hey,derek,derek,derek,come on. Hey,derek,derek,derek,come on.

23:55.640 --> 23:59.440
Hey,it's all right.Larry's a
friend of mine.Come here,come here.

24:01.260 --> 24:03.520
You don't want me to give
you any money right now.

24:03.530 --> 24:05.330
Trust me.

24:05.340 --> 24:08.040
So far neither of us has
done anything illegal.

24:08.050 --> 24:09.270
You gave me your word.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.460
Listen to me,will you?

24:11.470 --> 24:14.130
Giving you money is a crime,all right?

24:14.140 --> 24:16.790
It's bribery,obstruction of justice.

24:16.800 --> 24:19.560
We could both go to jail.

24:20.620 --> 24:22.100
Come on.

24:22.110 --> 24:26.290
It's the best way for
both of us. All right?

24:26.650 --> 24:28.920
Hey,come here.

24:28.930 --> 24:30.130
You live in jersey,right?

24:30.140 --> 24:32.340
Give him a 20,will you?

24:32.350 --> 24:37.320
Just do yourself a favor-- get
a cab and go home,please.Come on.

24:37.330 --> 24:40.110
Patty hewes has ears,too.

24:40.120 --> 24:43.770
Maybe I'm talking to the wrong person.

24:45.880 --> 24:48.760
Larry,you don't want to threaten me.

24:49.720 --> 24:50.580
Take the money.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.970
I mopped your floors,you son of a bitch!

24:52.980 --> 24:53.790
Oh,shit.

24:53.800 --> 24:57.210
34 years I cleaned your shit.

24:57.900 --> 25:00.190
What are you doing? Be gentle here,man.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.660
I hope you burn in hell!

25:03.990 --> 25:06.750
Oh,for chri... yeah,it's me.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.660
We need to talk.

25:17.550 --> 25:20.560
I'm sorry we had to run off like that.

25:20.570 --> 25:23.170
Dad,I admire you wanting
to visit this woman,

25:23.180 --> 25:25.630
but legally it was not a good move.

25:25.640 --> 25:26.750
It wasn't a move.

25:26.760 --> 25:27.320
I get it.

25:27.330 --> 25:30.100
But bringing her muffins,that kind
of thing can be used against you.

25:30.110 --> 25:32.110
It's an admission of guilt.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.950
I hit the woman with my car.

25:33.960 --> 25:34.960
I sent her to the hospital.

25:34.970 --> 25:36.980
I'm not supposed to go visit her?

25:36.990 --> 25:38.820
Unfortunately,no.

25:38.830 --> 25:40.540
And you can't apologize,either.

25:40.550 --> 25:41.760
You're involved in a lawsuit.

25:41.770 --> 25:44.310
You have to protect yourself.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.300
Mom,you know what? I'm not hungry.

25:46.310 --> 25:47.510
Nonsense.

25:47.520 --> 25:49.870
Ellen,I met the woman.

25:49.880 --> 25:50.920
I looked her in the eye.

25:50.930 --> 25:53.840
She's going to need physical
therapy for the next two years.

25:53.850 --> 25:55.760
It's not your job to get her bills paid.

25:55.770 --> 25:56.690
It's her lawyer'S.

25:56.700 --> 26:00.780
Well,I don't trust her lawyer any more than
I trust the guy from the insurance company.

26:00.790 --> 26:01.990
It's all a game to them.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.370
Yes,it is.

26:03.380 --> 26:04.770
And you could lose.

26:04.780 --> 26:08.480
That is why,in this deposition,you
have to keep your answers brief.

26:08.490 --> 26:10.740
- Do not elaborate.
- Fine.

26:10.750 --> 26:11.860
Keep it simple.

26:11.870 --> 26:14.730
Stick to the facts-- where the woman
was standing,how fast you were driving.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.430
That kind of thing. Understand?

26:16.440 --> 26:18.770
Yeah,got it.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.380
I think I should be there with you.

26:21.390 --> 26:22.550
Not necessary.

26:22.560 --> 26:25.430
Gary,she's not a 12-year-old
anymore; she's a lawyer.

26:25.440 --> 26:26.330
Let her help you.

26:26.340 --> 26:28.700
She has to be at work.

26:28.940 --> 26:29.900
Don't you?

26:29.910 --> 26:32.800
I'll make time. I'll be there.

26:56.620 --> 27:01.820
Well... this looks like
a whole lot of nothing.

27:02.360 --> 27:05.030
You know who built up
this part of the state?

27:05.040 --> 27:06.490
Wasps.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.270
Beavers.

27:08.280 --> 27:09.460
You lost me.

27:09.470 --> 27:11.120
No,I'm not kidding.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.140
Place was flush with them.

27:13.150 --> 27:16.000
Indians used to trap them and
then trade them for everything--

27:16.010 --> 27:18.700
blankets,hatchets,iron kettles.

27:18.710 --> 27:22.300
Then when they got hooked
on the white man's goods,

27:22.310 --> 27:25.230
they started trading the only
other thing they had left.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.000
Otters?

27:27.010 --> 27:29.610
No,you idiot.Land.

27:29.650 --> 27:31.560
I'm going to develop this.

27:31.570 --> 27:34.790
Real estate-- that's
not your thing.

27:34.800 --> 27:38.260
I'm sick and tired of standing around
the sidelines like this,you know?

27:38.270 --> 27:41.250
I need to... I need to build something.

27:43.570 --> 27:47.170
You want to tell me what
happened to gregory malina?

27:48.020 --> 27:50.740
Don't ask me; ask ray fiske.

27:50.750 --> 27:54.030
And while you're at it,ask him how
he knows malina in the first place,

27:54.040 --> 27:56.350
and why he used him to set
up the condo in palm beach.

27:56.360 --> 27:57.500
What difference does that make?

27:57.510 --> 27:59.580
I don't trust him.

27:59.590 --> 28:01.620
Five years ago,I went
out on a limb for you.

28:01.630 --> 28:03.600
You're not the only one in
the line of fire here,arthur.

28:03.610 --> 28:06.990
What happened to gregory malina?

28:07.570 --> 28:11.850
Looks like our boy gregory malina's
going to be deposed after all.

28:13.670 --> 28:16.980
Make sure it doesn't
get screwed up this time.

28:18.120 --> 28:20.130
I'll do it myself.

28:20.300 --> 28:21.910
I thought you didn't want to know.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.220
I do now.

28:46.340 --> 28:49.530
Ooh,excuse me. Sorry.

28:50.490 --> 28:53.140
- What's his name?
- Theo.

28:53.580 --> 28:56.550
Um,ms.Hewes,when we were in your office,

28:56.560 --> 28:59.280
were you suggesting
that I should fire him?

28:59.290 --> 29:00.790
Why?

29:00.800 --> 29:02.730
You want to fire him?

29:02.740 --> 29:05.160
He just started. I thought
I should give him some time.

29:05.170 --> 29:07.730
He's your assistant. Do what you want.

29:08.410 --> 29:10.580
Anything jumping out at you?

29:10.590 --> 29:11.470
Not yet.

29:11.480 --> 29:16.520
There is an official from the sec who was very
aggressive in going after frobisher's company.

29:16.530 --> 29:18.560
Tom and I thought he
might be worth talking to.

29:18.570 --> 29:19.470
His name?

29:19.480 --> 29:21.330
George moore.

29:21.340 --> 29:23.470
I don't think there's anything there.

29:23.480 --> 29:26.300
Moore was interviewed extensively
for the government trial.

29:26.310 --> 29:27.820
I thought we'd just pick his brain.

29:27.830 --> 29:31.130
If tom thinks it's
useful,it's fine with me.

29:31.140 --> 29:34.790
Uh,ms.Hewes,is it okay if tomorrow
I step out for a few hours?

29:34.800 --> 29:36.070
What for?

29:36.080 --> 29:38.370
My father hit a woman with his car.

29:38.380 --> 29:42.160
He's being deposed,and i
thought that I should be there.

29:42.170 --> 29:44.170
Well,of course.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.270
Is he at fault?

29:46.280 --> 29:47.540
He seems to think so.

29:47.550 --> 29:50.750
I mean,he's the kind of guy who
likes to take responsibility.

29:50.760 --> 29:51.580
Better be careful.

29:51.590 --> 29:55.230
We plaintiff attorneys can be vicious.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.720
His best strategy is
to blame the victim.

29:57.730 --> 29:58.620
I know.

29:58.630 --> 30:03.090
At all costs. It was her fault,period.

30:05.760 --> 30:09.280
He's in the bathroom,but
he'll be back in a minute.

30:09.960 --> 30:11.770
I'm so sorry to interrupt your dinner.

30:11.780 --> 30:13.440
Oh...

30:14.100 --> 30:15.950
Hello.You must be chloe.

30:15.960 --> 30:17.280
Patty hewes.

30:17.290 --> 30:19.740
And rob. Hello.

30:19.750 --> 30:21.130
What are you doing here?

30:21.140 --> 30:22.820
I was in the neighborhood.

30:22.830 --> 30:24.140
Thought I'd meet the family.

30:24.150 --> 30:26.110
Now is not a good time.

30:26.120 --> 30:27.920
How about I come by the office tomorrow?

30:27.930 --> 30:30.750
Ah,afraid it can't wait,larry.

30:30.760 --> 30:33.550
Ray fiske came to see me.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.330
He offered a settlement.

30:35.340 --> 30:36.680
Hey,that's terrific.

30:36.690 --> 30:39.280
$175 million.

30:42.510 --> 30:44.610
Should we take it?

30:44.970 --> 30:46.630
Why are you asking me?

30:46.640 --> 30:52.040
Because 175 is A... interesting number.

30:52.900 --> 30:55.700
I don't know what you're implying.

30:55.710 --> 30:57.320
You've been talking to the other side.

30:57.330 --> 30:58.310
Are you nuts?

30:58.320 --> 31:01.010
No,you don't want to do that.

31:01.020 --> 31:03.690
Don't speak without a
criminal attorney present.

31:03.700 --> 31:05.630
You're already facing three to five.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.960
How dare you come in here and
hijack me with accusations?

31:07.970 --> 31:12.420
Yeah,the truth is,larry,I like you,but
I think you're in over your head,

31:12.430 --> 31:16.480
and prison is the last
place where you belong.

31:16.820 --> 31:18.690
Arthur frobisher is smart.

31:18.700 --> 31:21.440
I'm sure he's got a way to
get you your blood money,

31:21.450 --> 31:26.340
with no paper trail,so I'm really just
here tonight to make you a promise.

31:26.350 --> 31:28.810
Oh,yeah? What's that?

31:29.600 --> 31:34.140
I'm going to wait and
watch... until you buy a house,

31:34.150 --> 31:38.870
or mildred buys a car,or
chloe here buys a toothbrush.

31:39.220 --> 31:42.270
You need to understand this,larry,

31:42.280 --> 31:48.190
no popler for the next hundred years will
be able to spend a nickel of that money

31:48.200 --> 31:53.310
without being
humiliated,disgraced and locked up.

31:58.990 --> 32:01.800
You all have a nice night.

32:18.710 --> 32:19.970
How do you plea?

32:19.980 --> 32:21.880
Not guilty.

32:23.450 --> 32:25.280
Not a flight risk,your honor.

32:25.290 --> 32:26.780
No prior criminal record.

32:26.790 --> 32:28.820
An upstanding member of the community.

32:28.830 --> 32:32.070
Bail is set at $1.5 million.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.800
Next.

32:36.300 --> 32:38.800
Do you swear to tell the
truth,the whole truth,

32:38.810 --> 32:41.420
and nothing but the
truth,so help you god?

32:41.430 --> 32:43.380
I do.

32:44.430 --> 32:48.800
And when you pulled even with the
stop sign,did you see miss reynolds?

32:49.380 --> 32:50.400
Uh,yes.

32:50.410 --> 32:53.870
She was standing to my
left,about ten feet away.

32:53.880 --> 32:55.860
Did you see miss reynolds
walk towards your vehicle?

32:55.870 --> 32:57.050
No.

32:57.060 --> 32:58.460
Not even out of the corner of your eye?

32:58.470 --> 33:00.780
Move on. You already said no.

33:01.820 --> 33:04.150
Mr.Parsons...

33:04.650 --> 33:08.160
what was your general state of
mind leading up to the accident?

33:08.170 --> 33:10.380
How about being a little more specific?

33:10.390 --> 33:13.910
Were you upset? Angry?

33:17.680 --> 33:21.260
Uh,well,just before it
happened,my wife and I...

33:21.270 --> 33:24.220
May we take five minutes,please?

33:26.510 --> 33:29.140
Mr.Parsons,I told you before,

33:29.150 --> 33:33.140
no one needs to know your emotional state
or that your attention was somewhere else.

33:33.150 --> 33:35.390
My wife and I were arguing.
I'm telling them what happened.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.570
- And as your attorney,I'm telling you...
- You're not his attorney.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.790
You represent his insurance company.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.620
I'd like a moment with my father.

33:43.190 --> 33:45.420
Dad,he's right.

33:45.430 --> 33:46.690
You agree with that creep?

33:46.700 --> 33:49.530
Your policy only covers $200,000.

33:49.540 --> 33:52.300
If the plaintiff is
awarded... She has a name--

33:52.310 --> 33:53.710
linda reynolds.

33:53.720 --> 33:57.730
If you admit fault and she's awarded more
than $200,000,you're personally liable.

33:57.740 --> 33:58.650
It was my fault.

33:58.660 --> 34:01.300
It was an accident.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.790
If that's work,you should go.

34:05.720 --> 34:08.239
Look,this guy isn't even
fighting for me anyway.

34:08.250 --> 34:12.179
He's just trying to save his company money
by refusing to pay linda's medical expenses.

34:12.190 --> 34:13.120
Why should I help him?

34:13.130 --> 34:16.800
Because she's got a lawyer who's
going to go after every penny he can.

34:16.810 --> 34:18.340
So you're saying i should
just go in there and lie?

34:18.350 --> 34:19.730
I'm saying that they will.

34:19.739 --> 34:21.980
They'll spin into gross negligence.

34:21.989 --> 34:23.699
This is the real world,dad.

34:23.710 --> 34:28.850
Hey,I don't need you to
teach me about the real world.

34:30.030 --> 34:32.679
I swore under oath.

34:32.690 --> 34:35.600
But you're the
lawyer,ellen,tell me what to do.

34:35.610 --> 34:39.130
I've told you what
to do again and again.

34:42.980 --> 34:49.010
Mr.Parsons,what was your general state
of mind leading up to the accident?

35:05.890 --> 35:08.040
Thank you for seeing me again.

35:08.050 --> 35:10.030
Well,thank you for calling,larry.

35:10.040 --> 35:12.220
I was sick about the other night.

35:12.230 --> 35:13.930
That was a terrible thing that happened.

35:13.940 --> 35:16.160
Nah,I should apologize to you.

35:16.170 --> 35:17.870
It's just I got all these pressures.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.040
I get it,I get it.

35:20.790 --> 35:24.090
Larry,the truth is,my attorney
doesn't even want me talking to you,

35:24.100 --> 35:27.900
so I'm not going to be able to
make good until after the trial.

35:27.910 --> 35:31.330
I understand,and i can hold
out. Just don't forget about me.

35:31.340 --> 35:35.440
Please... don't cut me out.

35:36.220 --> 35:38.870
Oh,that other thing,the witness?

35:38.880 --> 35:40.590
I'm looking into it.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.610
Thank you.

35:43.190 --> 35:45.650
You know who you remind me of,don't you?

35:46.220 --> 35:48.140
My dad.

35:48.150 --> 35:50.160
That means a lot.

35:50.170 --> 35:53.540
Guys like you are what make
this country great,larry.

36:03.200 --> 36:06.670
The guy from the sec wants to push
up our meeting. You ready in ten?

36:06.680 --> 36:08.980
Sure.

36:10.790 --> 36:14.650
Mom. What happened?What's going on?

36:15.120 --> 36:18.410
Your father wouldn't call
you,but I thought you should know.

36:18.420 --> 36:19.270
Know what?

36:19.280 --> 36:23.090
They're not just suing us
for hospital bills anymore.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.120
It's okay.

36:26.570 --> 36:30.240
They're saying this woman's hurt worse then
they thought,and she may never work again.

36:30.250 --> 36:31.610
How much are they asking for?

36:31.620 --> 36:34.880
Over a million dollars.

36:34.890 --> 36:36.410
They can't do that,can they?

36:36.420 --> 36:39.090
I mean,they can't just say
we owe them all that money.

36:39.100 --> 36:41.860
Yeah,mom,they can.

36:44.680 --> 36:47.640
Your father didn't have to
tell them we were arguing.

36:47.650 --> 36:50.850
Ellen? Uh,car's here.

36:59.290 --> 37:01.150
Your mom called earlier.

37:01.160 --> 37:03.090
I just... it's my fault.

37:03.100 --> 37:06.640
I didn't have a chance
to... tell you earlier.

37:06.650 --> 37:08.300
It's fine.

37:12.450 --> 37:14.240
You know what?

37:14.710 --> 37:17.190
It's not fine. You're fired.

37:26.680 --> 37:27.810
Where are they taking her?

37:27.820 --> 37:28.690
Rikers island.

37:28.700 --> 37:29.700
Oh,my god.

37:29.710 --> 37:31.520
What will it cost to post bond?

37:33.480 --> 37:37.060
We can't afford that.*******

37:38.630 --> 37:43.100
He was a lead investigator who
tried to take down frobisher.

37:43.390 --> 37:44.810
really?

37:46.760 --> 37:49.610
We're looking for mr.Moore.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.330
Hello there.

37:53.340 --> 37:55.140
Oh,tom shayes.

37:55.150 --> 37:56.230
Ellen parsons.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.370
The pleasure's mine.
Come on in.Take a seat.

37:58.380 --> 38:00.200
Thank you.

38:00.930 --> 38:01.670
Hello

38:01.680 --> 38:03.890
Hey,larry,you got a second?

38:03.900 --> 38:08.960
Listen,I want to... I want to reassure
you that that thing with the witness...

38:09.130 --> 38:14.810
I looked into it,and I can personally
guarantee you that gregory malina is safe.

38:14.820 --> 38:16.190
I'm glad to hear that.

38:16.200 --> 38:19.540
Yeah,evidently he had his own
reasons for not wanting to testify--

38:19.550 --> 38:22.090
drugs or something like that.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.660
I shouldn't have accused you.

38:23.670 --> 38:25.280
No,it all right.

38:25.290 --> 38:28.270
All right,I'll talk to you later.

38:30.900 --> 38:32.970
He says gregory malina is alive.

38:32.980 --> 38:34.780
Do you believe him?

38:34.790 --> 38:36.580
Do you?

38:36.590 --> 38:38.870
Well,we're going to find out.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.410
I'm glad you and I could
come to an arrangement,larry.

38:46.870 --> 38:48.720
Me,too.

38:49.110 --> 38:51.900
Whatever I could do
to make things right.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.200
Please don't do this.

39:20.210 --> 39:24.210
You decide right now-- do you
want us or do you want this job?

39:24.220 --> 39:27.340
Right... now!

39:32.390 --> 39:35.740
We're done,ellen.

39:58.470 --> 40:01.870
Hey,it's me.I'm so sorry.

40:02.150 --> 40:06.250
Just please... call me back,okay?
