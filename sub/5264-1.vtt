02:58.011 --> 02:59.929
Give me the child.

03:01.932 --> 03:06.435
Through dangers untold
and hardships unnumbered...

03:06.603 --> 03:10.189
...I have fought my way to the castle
beyond the Goblin City...

03:11.275 --> 03:14.277
...to take back the child
that you have stolen.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.531
For my will
is as strong as yours...

03:19.616 --> 03:22.118
...and my kingdom is as great.

03:27.791 --> 03:31.961
For my will is as strong as yours,
my kingdom as great.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.296
Damn.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.966
I can never remember that line.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.721
"You have no power over me."

03:47.019 --> 03:48.144
Oh, Merlin.

03:52.900 --> 03:56.319
Oh, no, Merlin.
I don't believe it. It's 7:00!

03:56.486 --> 03:58.779
Come on. Come on!

04:46.036 --> 04:48.204
It's not fair!

04:50.165 --> 04:51.582
Oh, really.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.210
- I'm sorry.
- Don't stand in the rain. Come on.

04:54.378 --> 04:56.379
All right. Come on, Merlin.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.381
- Come on.
- Not the dog.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.758
- But it's pouring.
- Go on, into the garage.

05:03.095 --> 05:05.888
Go on, Merlin.
Go into the garage.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.431
Go.

05:10.394 --> 05:13.270
- Sarah, you're an hour late.
- I said I'm sorry!

05:13.438 --> 05:15.231
Please let me finish.

05:15.399 --> 05:18.401
- Your father and I go out rarely.
- You go out every single weekend.

05:18.568 --> 05:22.446
I ask you to babysit only if it
won't interfere with your plans.

05:22.614 --> 05:26.242
You don't know what my plans are.
You don't even ask me anymore.

05:26.410 --> 05:29.578
I assume you'd tell me you had a date.
I'd like it if you had a date.

05:29.746 --> 05:33.708
- You should have dates at your age.
- Sarah, you're home.

05:33.875 --> 05:37.420
- We were worried about you.
- I can't do anything right, can I?

05:38.714 --> 05:42.216
She treats me like a wicked stepmother
in a fairy story no matter what I say.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.759
I'll talk to her.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.196
Through dangers untold...

06:06.116 --> 06:08.617
...and hardships unnumbered...

06:09.703 --> 06:12.288
...I have fought my way here
to the castle...

06:12.456 --> 06:14.457
...beyond the Goblin City...

06:15.959 --> 06:19.253
...to take back the child...

06:19.421 --> 06:22.131
...that you have stolen.

06:23.425 --> 06:28.637
- Sarah? Can I talk to you?
- There's nothing to talk about!

06:28.805 --> 06:30.306
Hurry. You're gonna be late.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.808
Listen, we fed Toby
and put him to bed.

06:32.976 --> 06:36.062
We do have to leave now,
but we'll be back around midnight.

06:37.314 --> 06:40.441
You really wanted
to talk to me, didn't you?

06:40.609 --> 06:43.319
Practically broke down the door.

06:46.323 --> 06:50.493
Lancelot!
Someone has been in my room again.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.579
I hate that. I hate it!

06:56.666 --> 06:58.584
I hate you. I hate you!

07:00.420 --> 07:04.215
Someone save me, take me away
from this awful place!

07:09.179 --> 07:12.389
What do you want?
You want a story, huh?

07:12.557 --> 07:13.974
Okay.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.604
Once upon a time
there was a beautiful, young girl...

07:18.772 --> 07:22.858
...whose stepmother always
made her stay home with the baby.

07:23.026 --> 07:26.320
The baby was a spoiled child
and wanted everything for himself...

07:26.488 --> 07:29.365
...and the young girl
was practically a slave.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.326
But what no one knew...

07:32.494 --> 07:35.704
...was that the king of the goblins
had fallen in love with the girl...

07:35.872 --> 07:38.207
...and he had given her
certain powers.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.792
So one night...

07:39.960 --> 07:43.337
...when the baby had been
particularly cruel to her...

07:43.505 --> 07:46.090
...she called on the goblins for help.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.176
Listen.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.557
"Say your right words,"
the goblins said.

07:55.892 --> 07:59.353
"And we'll take the baby
to the Goblin City...

07:59.521 --> 08:02.189
...and you will be free."

08:04.734 --> 08:07.361
But the girl knew
that the king of the goblins...

08:07.529 --> 08:11.031
...would keep the baby in his castle
forever and ever and ever...

08:11.199 --> 08:13.617
...and turn it into a goblin.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.661
So the girl suffered in silence...

08:15.829 --> 08:19.748
...until one night, when she was tired
from a day of housework...

08:19.916 --> 08:23.586
...and she was hurt by the harsh words
of her stepmother...

08:23.753 --> 08:25.921
...and she could no longer
stand it...

08:28.258 --> 08:30.593
All right! All right!

08:33.263 --> 08:35.847
Knock it off. Come on.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.100
Stop it! Stop it!

08:38.268 --> 08:40.102
I'll say the words.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.438
No, I mustn't. I mustn't say.

08:44.441 --> 08:47.860
I wish... I wish...

08:48.028 --> 08:50.196
- Is she going to say it?
- Say what?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.573
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.575
You shut up.

08:54.743 --> 08:57.453
Listen.
She's going to say the words.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.997
I can bear it no longer!

09:00.165 --> 09:03.959
Goblin King, Goblin King,
wherever you may be...

09:04.127 --> 09:07.630
...take this child of mine
far away from me!

09:11.259 --> 09:12.343
That's not it.

09:12.510 --> 09:16.013
Where'd she learn that rubbish?
It doesn't even start with, "I wish."

09:17.307 --> 09:19.850
Toby, stop it!

09:22.145 --> 09:25.856
I wish I did know what to say
to make the goblins take you away.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.692
"I wish the goblins would come
and take you away right now."

09:28.860 --> 09:30.778
That's not hard, is it?

09:32.530 --> 09:36.575
I wish...

09:36.743 --> 09:39.620
- Did she say it?
- Shut up!

09:57.555 --> 10:00.557
I wish the goblins would come
and take you away.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.103
Right now.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.582
Toby?

10:28.003 --> 10:30.129
Toby, are you all right?

10:37.137 --> 10:39.930
Why aren't you crying?

12:07.394 --> 12:10.687
You're him, aren't you?
You're the Goblin King.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.649
I want my brother back, please,
if it's all the same.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.026
What's said is said.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.112
But I didn't mean it.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.280
- You didn't?
- Please.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.698
Where is he?

12:21.866 --> 12:24.368
You know very well where he is.

12:24.536 --> 12:27.454
Please bring him back. Please.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.541
Sarah...

12:30.708 --> 12:32.751
...go back to your room...

12:32.919 --> 12:36.422
...play with your toys
and your costumes.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.507
Forget about the baby.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.051
I can't.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.846
I've brought you a gift.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.891
- What is it?
- It's a crystal...

12:48.059 --> 12:49.143
...nothing more.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.478
But if you turn it this way...

12:51.646 --> 12:53.188
...look into it...

12:53.356 --> 12:55.607
...it'll show you your dreams.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.777
But this is not a gift
for an ordinary girl...

12:58.945 --> 13:01.864
...who takes care
of a screaming baby.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.075
Do you want it?

13:07.662 --> 13:10.247
Then forget the baby.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.917
I can't.

13:14.085 --> 13:18.088
I appreciate what you're trying to do
for me, but I want my brother back.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.132
- He must be so scared.
- Sarah.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.893
Don't defy me.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.695
You're no match for me.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.947
But I have to
have my brother back.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.118
He's there, in my castle.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.793
Do you still
want to look for him?

13:58.630 --> 14:01.757
Is that the castle
beyond the Goblin City?

14:01.925 --> 14:05.969
Turn back, Sarah.
Turn back before it's too late.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.888
I can't.

14:08.056 --> 14:10.974
Don't you understand
that I can't?

14:11.142 --> 14:12.726
What a pity.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.938
It doesn't look that far.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.316
It's further than you think.
Time is short.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.200
You have 13 hours in which
to solve the labyrinth...

14:28.368 --> 14:30.452
...before your baby brother...

14:30.620 --> 14:32.579
...becomes one of us...

14:32.747 --> 14:34.164
...forever.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.167
Such a pity.

14:40.672 --> 14:41.755
The labyrinth.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.133
It doesn't look that hard.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.095
Well, come on, feet.

15:11.202 --> 15:14.413
- Excuse me?
- Excuse me!

15:15.456 --> 15:16.873
It's you.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.210
Excuse me, but I have to get through
this labyrinth. Can you help me?

15:25.675 --> 15:27.884
How sweet.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.887
Fifty-seven!

15:31.055 --> 15:33.557
- How could you?
- Yeah.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.809
Poor thing.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.479
You monster.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.399
It bit me!

15:42.567 --> 15:44.735
What did you expect
fairies to do?

15:44.902 --> 15:48.905
I thought they did nice things,
like granting wishes.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.533
Shows what you know,
don't it?

15:52.744 --> 15:54.620
- Fifty-eight.
- You're horrible.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.538
Huh? No, I ain't.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.832
I'm Hoggle. Who are you?

15:59.417 --> 16:01.710
- Sarah.
- That's what I thought.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.213
Fifty-nine.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.507
Do you know where the door
to the labyrinth is?

16:07.675 --> 16:10.010
- Maybe.
- Where is it?

16:10.178 --> 16:11.595
You little...

16:11.763 --> 16:13.388
Sixty!

16:13.556 --> 16:15.766
- I said, where is it?
- Where is what?

16:15.933 --> 16:17.976
- The door.
- What door?

16:18.144 --> 16:23.357
- It's hopeless asking you anything.
- Not if you ask the right questions.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.317
How do I get into the labyrinth?

16:30.031 --> 16:32.491
Now that's more like it.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.494
You gets in there.

16:44.587 --> 16:47.464
You really going in there,
are you?

16:49.717 --> 16:51.468
Yes.

16:51.636 --> 16:54.137
I'm afraid I have to.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.744
Cosy, isn't it?

17:24.001 --> 17:28.422
Now, would you go left
or right?

17:30.883 --> 17:35.011
- They both look the same.
- Well, you're not gonna get very far.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.973
- Which way would you go?
- Me?

17:38.141 --> 17:39.516
I wouldn't go either way.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.352
If that's all the help you're
gonna be, you can just leave.

17:42.520 --> 17:46.690
You know your problem?
You take too many things for granted.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.025
Take this labyrinth...

17:49.193 --> 17:52.362
...even if you get to the centre,
you'll never get out again.

17:52.530 --> 17:56.533
- That's your opinion.
- It's a lot better than yours.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.953
Thanks for nothing, Hogwart.

18:01.372 --> 18:05.208
It's Hoggle!
And don't say I didn't warn you.

19:09.607 --> 19:12.609
What do they mean, "labyrinth"?
There aren't any turns or corners.

19:12.777 --> 19:15.111
It just goes on and on.

19:21.953 --> 19:23.870
Maybe it doesn't.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.792
Maybe I'm just taking it
for granted that it does.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.342
'Allo.

20:27.268 --> 20:28.602
Did you say "hello"?

20:28.769 --> 20:31.438
No, I said, "'Allo,"
but that's close enough.

20:33.608 --> 20:37.027
- You're a worm, aren't you?
- Yeah, that's right.

20:37.194 --> 20:40.113
You don't by any chance
know the way through this labyrinth?

20:40.281 --> 20:42.741
Who, me?
No, I'm just a worm.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.369
Come inside, meet the missus.

20:46.537 --> 20:50.624
No, thank you, but I have
to solve this labyrinth.

20:50.791 --> 20:53.335
But there aren't any turns
or any openings or anything.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.503
It just goes on and on.

20:55.671 --> 20:59.466
You ain't looking right. It's full
of openings, but you ain't seeing them.

20:59.634 --> 21:01.885
- Where are they?
- There's one just across there.

21:02.053 --> 21:04.387
It's right in front of you.

21:05.473 --> 21:06.556
No, there isn't.

21:06.724 --> 21:09.392
Come inside and have
a nice cup of tea.

21:09.560 --> 21:13.480
- But there isn't an opening.
- Of course there is.

21:13.648 --> 21:17.108
You try walking through it.
You'll see what I mean.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.903
- What?
- Go on then.

21:22.073 --> 21:24.950
That's just wall.
There's no way through.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.410
Things are not always
what they seem in this place.

21:27.578 --> 21:30.914
So you can't take anything
for granted.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.464
Hey!

21:40.758 --> 21:42.884
- Hang on.
- Thank you.

21:43.052 --> 21:46.096
- That was incredibly helpful.
- Don't go that way.

21:46.263 --> 21:48.932
- What was that?
- I said don't go that way.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.685
Never go that way.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.604
Thanks.

21:54.772 --> 21:57.899
If she had kept on
going down that way...

21:58.067 --> 22:00.860
...she'd had gone straight
to that castle.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.622
Toby.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.626
I'm coming, Toby.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.974
Give me back this!
Go on, get off me.

22:31.934 --> 22:34.144
Stay out of the way.
What are you talking about?

22:34.311 --> 22:36.229
Walk, walk, walk.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.755
- You remind me of the babe.
- What babe?

23:01.922 --> 23:03.590
- The babe with the power.
- What power?

23:03.758 --> 23:05.258
- The power of voodoo.
- Who do?

23:05.426 --> 23:06.426
- You do.
- Do what?

23:06.635 --> 23:09.220
Remind me of the babe.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.015
Quiet! A goblin babe.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.270
Well?

24:28.551 --> 24:30.468
Hey, what goes on?

24:35.808 --> 24:38.852
Your mother is an aardvark!

24:56.912 --> 24:59.706
In nine hours and 23 minutes...

24:59.874 --> 25:01.791
...you'll be mine.

26:33.467 --> 26:34.717
- You got it?
- I got it.

26:34.885 --> 26:36.344
Good.

26:38.222 --> 26:39.973
Oh, no.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.943
Someone has been
changing my marks.

26:52.111 --> 26:55.238
What a horrible place this is.
It's not fair!

26:55.864 --> 26:57.907
That's right. It's not fair.

26:59.410 --> 27:01.119
But that's only half of it.

27:02.496 --> 27:06.749
- This was a dead end a minute ago.
- No, that's the dead end behind you.

27:11.755 --> 27:14.465
It keeps changing.
What am I supposed to do?

27:14.633 --> 27:17.510
The only way out of here
is to try one of these doors.

27:17.678 --> 27:20.513
One of them leads to the castle
at the centre of the labyrinth.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.682
And the other one leads to...

27:22.850 --> 27:25.018
...certain death.

27:28.105 --> 27:30.606
Which one is which?

27:30.774 --> 27:32.775
- We can't tell you.
- Why not?

27:35.195 --> 27:37.447
- We don't know.
- But they do.

27:38.365 --> 27:40.533
Then I'll ask them.

27:41.285 --> 27:44.579
No, you can't ask us.
You can only ask one of us.

27:44.747 --> 27:47.540
It's in the rules.
And I should warn you...

27:47.708 --> 27:51.586
...one of us always tells the truth,
and one of us always lies.

27:51.754 --> 27:54.130
That's a rule too.
He always lies.

27:54.298 --> 27:57.759
- I do not. I tell the truth.
- What a lie.

27:59.553 --> 28:01.304
He's the liar.

28:02.056 --> 28:04.015
All right. Answer yes or no.

28:05.351 --> 28:09.062
Would he tell me that this door
leads to the castle?

28:12.649 --> 28:14.984
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

28:15.861 --> 28:16.986
Yes.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.907
Then the other door leads
to the castle...

28:21.075 --> 28:24.285
...and this door leads
to certain death.

28:24.745 --> 28:27.038
How do you know?
He could be telling the truth.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.539
But then you wouldn't be.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.376
So if you told me that he said yes,
I know the answer is no.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.379
- But I could be telling the truth.
- But then he would be lying.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.840
So if you told me that he said yes,
I know the answer would still be no.

28:38.008 --> 28:40.009
Wait a minute. Is that right?

28:40.177 --> 28:42.762
I don't know.
I've never understood it.

28:44.098 --> 28:47.141
No, it's right.
I've figured it out.

28:47.309 --> 28:49.352
I could never do it before.

28:49.520 --> 28:53.481
I think I'm getting smarter.
This is a piece of cake.

28:56.693 --> 28:58.152
Help!

29:01.490 --> 29:03.199
Stop it! Help!

29:04.034 --> 29:06.953
What do you mean, "help"?
We are helping.

29:07.121 --> 29:09.038
We're helping hands.

29:09.206 --> 29:10.706
You're hurting.

29:10.874 --> 29:13.626
Would you like us to let go?

29:14.378 --> 29:16.129
No!

29:16.964 --> 29:19.215
Well then, come on,
which way?

29:19.383 --> 29:20.716
Which way?

29:20.884 --> 29:23.553
Up or down?

29:24.471 --> 29:26.139
Come on, come on.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.141
We haven't got all day.

29:28.308 --> 29:31.018
Well, it's a big decision for her.

29:31.186 --> 29:34.105
Which way do you want to go?

29:35.190 --> 29:36.524
Yes, which way?

29:38.068 --> 29:41.320
Well, since I'm pointed that way,
I guess I'll go down.

29:41.488 --> 29:44.449
She chose down.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.742
She chose down?

29:46.910 --> 29:49.745
- Was that wrong?
- Too late now.

30:03.427 --> 30:05.720
She's in the oubliette.

30:05.888 --> 30:08.848
Shut up! She should not have gotten
as far as the oubliette.

30:09.016 --> 30:12.310
- She should have given up by now.
- She'll never give up.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.605
Won't she? The dwarf's about
to lead her back to the beginning.

30:15.772 --> 30:20.276
She'll soon give up when she realises
she has to start all over again.

30:21.862 --> 30:23.279
Well, laugh.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.415
Who's there?

30:34.583 --> 30:35.958
Me.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.921
- It's you.
- Yes, well...

30:40.088 --> 30:43.049
...I knew you were gonna get into
trouble as soon as I met you.

30:43.217 --> 30:45.635
So I've come to give you a hand.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.096
You're looking around now,
aren't you?

30:49.264 --> 30:51.974
I suppose you noticed
there ain't no doors.

30:52.142 --> 30:54.060
Only the hole.

30:55.354 --> 30:58.523
This is an oubliette.
The labyrinth's full of them.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.692
- Really? How do you know that?
- Don't sound so smart.

31:01.860 --> 31:05.029
- You don't know what an oubliette is.
- Do you?

31:05.197 --> 31:10.326
Yes, it's a place you put people
to forget about them.

31:10.494 --> 31:14.038
Now, what you've gotta do
is get out of here.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.041
And it so happens
that I know a shortcut...

31:17.209 --> 31:19.210
...out of the whole labyrinth
from here.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.504
No, I'm not giving up now.

31:21.672 --> 31:23.548
I've come too far.

31:27.427 --> 31:31.180
- No, I'm doing okay.
- Of course you are.

31:31.348 --> 31:34.517
But it gets a lot worse
from here on in.

31:36.019 --> 31:38.271
Why are you so concerned about me?

31:38.438 --> 31:41.232
Well, I am, that's all.

31:41.400 --> 31:45.820
Nice, young girl.
Terrible, black oubliette.

31:46.863 --> 31:49.198
You like jewellery, don't you?

31:49.366 --> 31:50.866
Why?

31:51.034 --> 31:54.870
If you help me solve the labyrinth,
I'll give you this.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.625
You like it, don't you?

31:59.793 --> 32:01.460
So-so.

32:01.962 --> 32:03.879
Okay.

32:04.506 --> 32:05.548
Tell you what...

32:05.716 --> 32:09.427
...give me the bracelet and I'll
show you the way out of the labyrinth.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.179
- You were gonna do that anyway.
- Yes, well...

32:12.347 --> 32:16.601
...that would make it a
particularly nice gesture on your part.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.227
No. I'll tell you what...

32:18.395 --> 32:21.314
...if you won't take me to the centre,
take me as far as you can.

32:21.481 --> 32:24.817
- Then I'll do it on my own.
- What is that anyway?

32:26.028 --> 32:27.111
Plastic.

32:29.406 --> 32:32.408
I don't promise nothing, but...

32:32.576 --> 32:36.412
...l'll take you as far as I can.
Then you're on your own, right?

32:36.997 --> 32:38.748
- Right.
- Right.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.001
Plastic!

32:46.465 --> 32:48.424
Here we go.

32:54.014 --> 32:55.598
Damn.

32:55.766 --> 32:57.183
Broom closet.

32:59.436 --> 33:02.355
Well, can't be right
all the time.

33:05.442 --> 33:08.444
This is it. Come on then.

33:15.786 --> 33:18.996
- This way.
- Don't go on.

33:19.164 --> 33:22.375
Go back while you still can.

33:22.542 --> 33:25.628
This is not the way.

33:25.796 --> 33:29.215
Take heed and go no further.

33:29.383 --> 33:33.594
Beware. Beware.

33:33.762 --> 33:36.138
Soon it will be too late.

33:36.306 --> 33:38.474
Don't pay any attention
to them.

33:38.642 --> 33:42.144
They're just false alarms.
You get a lot of them in the labyrinth.

33:42.312 --> 33:44.188
Especially when you're
on the right track.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.191
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Shut up.

33:47.359 --> 33:50.486
- Sorry. Just doing my job.
- You don't have to do it to us.

33:50.654 --> 33:53.572
- Beware for...
- Just forget it.

33:53.740 --> 33:57.326
Please, I haven't said it
for such a long time.

33:57.494 --> 34:00.871
All right, but don't
expect a big reaction.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.666
No, no, no, of course not.

34:03.834 --> 34:07.962
For the path you will take
will lead to certain destruction.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.880
Thank you very much.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.174
Oh, no.

34:18.348 --> 34:20.391
What have we here?

34:20.559 --> 34:22.810
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

34:22.978 --> 34:25.603
Nothing? Nothing?

34:25.772 --> 34:27.606
Nothing, tra-la-la?

34:27.774 --> 34:30.693
Your Majesty,
what a nice surprise.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.902
- Hello, Hedgewart.
- Hogwart.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.405
Hoggle!

34:34.572 --> 34:37.366
Hoggle, can it be
that you're helping this girl?

34:37.534 --> 34:40.286
Helping? In what sense?

34:40.454 --> 34:42.955
In the sense that you're
leading her towards the castle.

34:43.123 --> 34:46.167
No, I was taking her back
to the beginning, Your Majesty.

34:46.333 --> 34:47.668
What?

34:47.835 --> 34:51.213
I told her I was gonna help her
solve the labyrinth...

34:51.380 --> 34:54.507
...a little trickery on my part,
but actually...

34:54.676 --> 34:57.720
What is that plastic thing
round your wrist?

35:00.307 --> 35:01.557
Oh, this?

35:03.810 --> 35:06.312
My goodness,
where did this come from?

35:06.480 --> 35:07.897
- Higgle...
- Hoggle.

35:08.064 --> 35:10.733
If I thought for one second
that you were betraying me...

35:10.901 --> 35:14.737
...l'd be forced to suspend you
headfirst in the Bog of Eternal Stench.

35:14.905 --> 35:18.908
No, Your Majesty!
Not the Eternal Stench!

35:19.075 --> 35:20.910
Yes, Hoggle!

35:21.077 --> 35:23.537
And you, Sarah.

35:23.705 --> 35:25.664
How are you enjoying
my labyrinth?

35:28.043 --> 35:29.919
It's a piece of cake.

35:31.797 --> 35:35.049
Really? Then how about
upping the stakes.

35:37.594 --> 35:39.094
That's not fair!

35:39.262 --> 35:41.263
You say that so often.

35:41.431 --> 35:45.184
I wonder what your basis
for comparison is.

35:45.352 --> 35:47.728
So the labyrinth's
a piece of cake, is it?

35:47.896 --> 35:51.357
Well, let's see how you deal
with this little slice.

35:58.782 --> 36:01.075
No, the cleaners!

36:01.243 --> 36:03.118
- What?
- Run!

36:09.501 --> 36:11.293
You okay?

36:13.880 --> 36:15.297
Come on!

36:16.716 --> 36:18.133
Faster!

36:22.430 --> 36:23.931
Oh, no.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.685
The cleaners!
The Bog of Stench!

36:27.853 --> 36:30.479
You sure got his attention.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.505
This is what we need...

36:56.673 --> 36:58.841
...a ladder. Follow me.

36:59.009 --> 37:02.595
How can I trust you now that I know you
were taking me back to the beginning?

37:02.762 --> 37:04.221
I wasn't.

37:04.389 --> 37:08.726
I told him I was taking you back to the
beginning to throw him off the scent.

37:08.894 --> 37:11.604
Hoggle, how can I believe
anything you say?

37:11.771 --> 37:14.481
Well, let me put it this way.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.734
What choice have you got?

37:19.112 --> 37:20.529
You're right.

37:23.074 --> 37:26.285
You see, you've gotta
understand my position.

37:26.453 --> 37:29.872
I'm a coward,
and Jareth scares me.

37:30.040 --> 37:34.043
- What kind of position is that?
- No position. That's my point.

37:34.210 --> 37:37.087
You wouldn't be so brave
if you'd ever smelled...

37:37.255 --> 37:39.256
...the Bog of Eternal Stench.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.467
It's... It's...

37:44.596 --> 37:46.680
Is that all it does, is smell?

37:46.848 --> 37:49.058
Believe me, that's enough.

37:49.225 --> 37:51.894
But the worst thing is,
if you so much...

37:52.062 --> 37:54.063
...as put a foot
in the Bog of Stench...

37:54.230 --> 37:57.358
...you'll smell bad
for the rest of your life.

37:57.525 --> 38:00.110
It'll never wash off.

38:04.324 --> 38:07.993
Here we are then.
You're on your own from now on.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.581
- What?
- That's it. I quit.

38:12.749 --> 38:16.710
Wait a minute. Hoggle!

38:17.671 --> 38:21.590
I didn't promise nothing. I said
I'd take you as far as I could go.

38:21.758 --> 38:24.426
You little cheat.
You nasty, little cheat.

38:24.594 --> 38:27.429
Don't try to embarrass me.
I've got no pride.

38:27.597 --> 38:29.598
Oh, yeah?

38:29.766 --> 38:31.350
But them's my jewels!

38:31.518 --> 38:34.937
You give them back!
Give them back. Give those back.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.148
Give those back to me!

38:38.316 --> 38:42.736
Now, there's the castle.
Which way should we try?

38:42.904 --> 38:46.865
Them's my rightful property.
It's not fair!

38:47.033 --> 38:49.410
No, it isn't.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.954
But that's the way it is.

39:00.630 --> 39:03.966
Excuse me, please,
but can you help me?

39:05.051 --> 39:06.301
A young girl!

39:09.014 --> 39:11.390
And who is this?

39:12.308 --> 39:15.185
- My friend.
- Well, yes.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.771
And what can I do for you?

39:17.939 --> 39:19.940
Please, can you tell...?
That is...

39:20.108 --> 39:24.611
I have to get to the castle
at the centre. Do you know the way?

39:26.322 --> 39:28.824
Well, yes, now.

39:28.992 --> 39:31.577
You want to get to the castle.

39:31.745 --> 39:33.954
How's that for brainpower, huh?

39:34.122 --> 39:35.330
Be quiet!

39:35.498 --> 39:37.166
Ah, nuts.

39:37.333 --> 39:40.294
So, young woman...

39:40.462 --> 39:44.798
...the way forward
is sometimes the way back.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.927
Will you listen to this crap?

39:49.095 --> 39:52.765
- Will you please be quiet?!
- Sorry. All right.

39:52.932 --> 39:53.974
- Okay?
- Okay!

39:54.142 --> 39:56.101
- All right.
- All right!

39:56.269 --> 39:58.187
- What?
- Sorry.

40:00.190 --> 40:01.648
Finished?

40:02.859 --> 40:04.276
Yes.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.030
Quite often, young lady...

40:08.198 --> 40:12.534
...it seems like we're not getting
anywhere, when in fact...

40:12.702 --> 40:15.954
- We are.
- We are.

40:16.122 --> 40:19.333
I'm certainly not getting
anywhere at the moment.

40:19.501 --> 40:20.709
Join the club.

40:24.547 --> 40:27.591
I think that's your lot.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.969
Please leave a contribution
in the little box.

40:33.014 --> 40:35.057
Don't you dare! Them's mine.

40:39.646 --> 40:42.648
Well, I guess I can spare this.

40:47.904 --> 40:50.823
You didn't
have to give him that.

40:50.990 --> 40:52.825
He didn't tell you nothing.

40:52.992 --> 40:56.161
Well then,
there go a couple of suckers.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.583
It's so stimulating
being your hat.

41:04.629 --> 41:05.838
Why did you say that...

41:06.005 --> 41:08.048
...about my being your friend?

41:08.216 --> 41:09.591
Because you are.

41:09.759 --> 41:11.301
You may not be much of a friend...

41:11.469 --> 41:14.179
...but you're the only one I've got
in this place.

41:14.389 --> 41:16.557
Do you hear something?

41:16.724 --> 41:19.143
- No, it's all right.
- Friend.

41:20.603 --> 41:21.854
I like that.

41:22.856 --> 41:25.732
I ain't never been
no one's friend before.

41:27.694 --> 41:29.987
- Goodbye!
- Wait a minute.

41:30.155 --> 41:32.072
- Keep the stuff.
- Are you my friend or not?

41:32.240 --> 41:34.533
No, I'm not.
Hoggle ain't no one's friend.

41:34.701 --> 41:37.578
He looks after himself,
like everyone.

41:37.745 --> 41:40.414
Hoggle is Hoggle's friend.

41:40.582 --> 41:43.083
Hoggle, you coward!

41:45.962 --> 41:47.796
Well, I'm not afraid.

41:47.964 --> 41:51.300
Things aren't always
what they seem in this place.

41:57.640 --> 42:00.726
Try on this for size,
you big yeti!

42:00.894 --> 42:03.478
We've got you now,
fuzzball!

42:04.856 --> 42:06.190
All together now.

42:13.448 --> 42:16.283
If only I had something to throw.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.501
Sock it to him!
Sock it to him!

42:30.256 --> 42:34.927
What happened? Who turned out
the light? I can't see!

42:36.679 --> 42:39.681
- Why'd you bite me?
- Who bite who?

42:39.849 --> 42:42.142
Who bite me? Who bite me?

42:43.478 --> 42:46.230
- I can't see!
- What is going on?

42:50.193 --> 42:53.070
Retreat!

42:55.031 --> 42:56.114
Who bit me?

42:57.450 --> 42:58.700
My aching sushi!

43:11.214 --> 43:13.173
Now, stop that.

43:15.426 --> 43:18.053
Is that any way to treat someone
who's trying to help you?

43:19.222 --> 43:22.057
Don't you want me
to help you down?

43:23.518 --> 43:27.896
Ludo down.

43:28.064 --> 43:29.439
Ludo?

43:30.608 --> 43:31.733
Is that your name?

43:32.485 --> 43:34.987
Ludo.

43:35.154 --> 43:38.198
You seem like such a nice beast.

43:39.492 --> 43:42.452
Well, I certainly hope you
are what you seem to be.

43:44.455 --> 43:47.291
Just hang on.
I'll get you down.

43:49.085 --> 43:50.585
Just a second.

43:51.838 --> 43:53.463
I'm sorry!

43:55.800 --> 43:58.093
Ludo, are you hurt?

43:59.053 --> 44:00.846
Ludo?

44:05.852 --> 44:06.935
Friend?

44:07.103 --> 44:11.106
That's right, Ludo.
I'm Sarah.

44:12.525 --> 44:13.942
Sarah.

44:16.112 --> 44:18.196
Here, let me help you.

44:18.364 --> 44:20.282
Are you okay?

44:24.078 --> 44:29.249
Sarah. Sarah friend.

44:29.417 --> 44:31.793
Now, wait. Just a second.

44:31.961 --> 44:35.630
- I want to ask you something, Ludo.
- What?

44:35.798 --> 44:38.383
I have to get to the castle
at the labyrinth's centre.

44:38.551 --> 44:40.260
Do you know the way?

44:46.309 --> 44:49.353
- No.
- You don't know either, huh?

44:49.520 --> 44:52.189
I wonder if anyone knows how
to get through this labyrinth.

44:53.316 --> 44:57.319
Get through the labyrinth.
Get through the labyrinth.

44:57.487 --> 45:01.323
One thing for sure. She'll never
get through the labyrinth.

45:05.661 --> 45:07.120
Hey.

45:09.499 --> 45:11.666
Where did they come from?

45:14.545 --> 45:16.213
What do you think?

45:16.381 --> 45:19.007
Which shall we choose
out of these two ugly characters?

45:23.554 --> 45:27.015
It's very rude to stare!

45:27.183 --> 45:29.893
I'm sorry. I was just wondering
which door to choose.

45:30.061 --> 45:31.978
- What?
- It's no good asking him.

45:32.146 --> 45:34.564
- He's deaf as a post.
- Don't talk with your mouth full.

45:34.732 --> 45:37.067
- I'm not talking with my mouth full!
- Wait a second.

45:37.235 --> 45:39.361
- I can't understand you.
- What were you saying?

45:45.034 --> 45:48.370
- It is so good to get that thing out.
- What were you saying?

45:48.538 --> 45:51.540
I said, it's no good talking to him.
He's deaf as a post.

45:51.707 --> 45:55.419
Mumble, mumble. You're a wonderful
conversational companion.

45:55.586 --> 45:57.796
You can talk!
All you do is moan!

45:57.964 --> 46:00.132
No good. Can't hear you.

46:01.968 --> 46:03.844
- Where do these doors lead?
- What?

46:04.011 --> 46:07.764
Search me.
We're just the knockers.

46:13.020 --> 46:14.896
- How do I get through?
- Huh?

46:15.064 --> 46:18.400
Knock, and the door will open.

46:21.404 --> 46:22.446
Ludo.

46:27.326 --> 46:29.327
I don't want that thing
back in my mouth.

46:29.495 --> 46:31.830
Come on. I want to knock.

46:31.998 --> 46:37.169
Doesn't want his ring back in his
mouth, eh? Can't say I blame him.

46:56.105 --> 46:59.691
- Sorry.
- That's all right. I'm used to it.

47:08.576 --> 47:10.660
Come on, Ludo.

47:29.722 --> 47:31.723
You're welcome.

47:35.645 --> 47:38.772
He's a lively little chap.
I think I'll call him Jareth.

47:38.940 --> 47:41.650
He's got my eyes.

47:55.748 --> 47:58.625
Ludo scared.

47:58.793 --> 48:01.419
Give me your hand.

48:01.587 --> 48:03.171
Come on.

48:03.339 --> 48:05.882
Imagine a big thing like you
being scared.

48:06.050 --> 48:07.467
Yeah.

48:09.011 --> 48:11.888
See, Ludo? There's nothing
to be afraid of.

48:15.768 --> 48:25.569
Ludo?

48:28.072 --> 48:30.031
Ludo, where are you?

48:31.742 --> 48:33.868
Ludo?

48:39.041 --> 48:41.126
Hoggle, help!

48:41.294 --> 48:45.422
- I'm coming, Sarah.
- Well, if it isn't you.

48:45.590 --> 48:48.216
And where are you going?

48:49.885 --> 48:52.220
Well, the little lady
gave me the slip...

48:52.388 --> 48:55.015
...but I just hears her now.

48:55.182 --> 48:58.310
So I was about to lead her
back to the beginning...

48:58.477 --> 49:00.478
...like you told me.

49:00.646 --> 49:02.772
- I see.
- Ludo!

49:02.940 --> 49:05.692
For one moment I thought
you were running to help her.

49:05.860 --> 49:09.404
But no, not after my warnings.

49:09.572 --> 49:12.741
- That would be stupid.
- You bet it would!

49:12.908 --> 49:16.536
Me help her
after your warnings?

49:20.082 --> 49:22.917
- Oh, dear. Poor Hoghead.
- Hoggle.

49:24.462 --> 49:27.422
I've just noticed
your lovely jewels are missing.

49:28.549 --> 49:30.800
Yes, so they are.

49:30.968 --> 49:33.887
My lovely jewels. Let me think.

49:34.055 --> 49:37.057
I better find them, but first
I'm off to take the little lady...

49:37.224 --> 49:40.101
...back to the beginning
of the labyrinth like we planned.

49:40.269 --> 49:41.895
Wait.

49:42.063 --> 49:44.064
I've got a much better plan.

49:46.150 --> 49:47.776
Give her this.

49:49.779 --> 49:52.197
What is it?

49:52.365 --> 49:53.823
It's a present.

49:53.991 --> 49:56.201
It ain't gonna hurt
the little lady, is it?

49:56.369 --> 49:58.036
Why the concern?

49:59.538 --> 50:02.916
- I won't do nothing to harm her.
- Come, come, Hogbrain.

50:03.084 --> 50:05.460
I'm surprised at you
losing your head over a girl.

50:05.628 --> 50:07.462
I ain't lost my head.

50:07.630 --> 50:09.839
You don't think a young girl
could ever like...

50:10.007 --> 50:13.635
...a repulsive little scab
like you, do you?

50:13.803 --> 50:15.720
- She said we was...
- What?

50:15.888 --> 50:18.014
Bosom companions?

50:18.182 --> 50:19.808
Friends?

50:21.185 --> 50:23.144
- Don't matter.
- You'll give her that...

50:23.312 --> 50:26.356
...or I'll tip you straight
into the Bog of Eternal Stench...

50:26.524 --> 50:28.358
...before you can blink.

50:28.526 --> 50:30.068
Yes. Right.

50:32.488 --> 50:34.155
And Hoggle...

50:34.323 --> 50:37.450
...if she ever kisses you,
I'll turn you into a prince.

50:37.618 --> 50:39.494
You...? You will?

50:39.662 --> 50:41.996
Prince of the Land of Stench.

50:48.379 --> 50:54.175
Ludo?

50:57.179 --> 50:59.139
What's going on?

51:03.352 --> 51:04.769
- What do you want?
- What, us?

51:06.605 --> 51:09.149
We just have to
have a good time.

51:09.316 --> 51:10.400
That's right!

51:48.022 --> 51:49.689
Like the man said,
don't lose your head.

51:54.445 --> 51:55.904
Hey, I'm a wild child.

51:57.907 --> 51:59.449
Walk tall.

52:08.083 --> 52:09.709
Roll 'em.

52:10.753 --> 52:11.836
Snake eyes!

52:16.550 --> 52:19.427
Hey, lady!

52:29.772 --> 52:30.939
Fore!

52:43.410 --> 52:44.786
Bad luck.

53:07.351 --> 53:08.810
Hey, listen up.

53:14.108 --> 53:16.484
Shake your pretty little head.

53:17.278 --> 53:19.571
Tap your pretty little feet.

53:19.947 --> 53:21.322
Come on! Come on!

53:23.325 --> 53:26.953
Hey, hey!
Her head don't come off.

53:27.121 --> 53:29.247
Of course it doesn't!

53:29.415 --> 53:31.624
- She's right. It's stuck on.
- Hey, lady.

53:31.792 --> 53:33.626
Where you going
with a head like that?

53:33.794 --> 53:37.839
Hey, man, I know what we can do.
Take off her head!

53:38.007 --> 53:40.216
Yeah, let's take her apart.

53:40.384 --> 53:42.051
Lady, that's his head.

53:42.219 --> 53:44.345
- That's my head!
- That's a friend of mine.

53:44.513 --> 53:47.015
What are you doing?

53:53.397 --> 53:54.856
Hey, lady...

53:55.024 --> 53:57.901
...it's against the rules
to throw other people's heads.

53:58.068 --> 54:00.361
You're only allowed
to throw your own head.

54:00.529 --> 54:02.155
Yeah, that's right.

54:02.323 --> 54:04.532
Where's the referee?

54:04.700 --> 54:06.993
Now we got to take your head off.

54:07.870 --> 54:11.164
- Stop her. Somebody stop her.
- Come back, little lady.

54:11.332 --> 54:14.709
- Play the game.
- Yeah, we're going to throw your head.

54:14.877 --> 54:16.878
You can't quit.
The game's not over.

54:18.714 --> 54:20.048
- Hey, lady!
- Leave me alone!

54:20.215 --> 54:24.344
- We get a free throw.
- Don't you want to take your head off?

54:24.511 --> 54:27.388
- Sure she does.
- Grab it!

54:27.556 --> 54:30.892
- Don't you want to look like us?
- Leave me alone.

54:32.478 --> 54:34.395
It won't hurt! Get a saw!

54:34.563 --> 54:37.398
If you play,
we'll take off your arms!

54:37.566 --> 54:41.444
- Take off your ear.
- You don't need two ears.

54:41.612 --> 54:43.821
- Game's almost over.
- Down's up.

54:43.989 --> 54:48.326
- Go away.
- Hoggle, you've come to help me.

54:50.496 --> 54:53.456
Don't kiss me! Don't kiss me!

54:53.624 --> 54:57.043
No, no, no!

55:03.217 --> 55:05.718
Hoggle, hold on.

55:08.847 --> 55:10.640
Oh, my God.

55:16.647 --> 55:18.439
What is it?

55:18.607 --> 55:21.526
The Bog of Eternal Stench!

55:24.822 --> 55:27.281
I've never smelled anything like it.
It's like...

55:32.621 --> 55:36.541
It doesn't matter what it's like.
It's a Bog of Eternal Stench.

55:36.709 --> 55:38.126
Help!

55:40.170 --> 55:42.505
Hold on.

55:45.384 --> 55:48.678
What did you have to go
and do a thing like that for?

55:48.846 --> 55:49.929
Do what?

55:52.766 --> 55:55.768
- You mean rescue you?
- What? No.

55:55.936 --> 55:58.021
You kissed me.

56:03.652 --> 56:06.446
Oh, my gosh.

56:06.613 --> 56:09.449
Don't pretend to be so hard.

56:09.616 --> 56:13.327
I know you came back to help me,
and I know that you're my friend.

56:13.495 --> 56:15.246
Did not. Am not.

56:15.414 --> 56:18.541
I just come
to get me property back.

56:18.709 --> 56:20.501
Oh, and...

56:20.669 --> 56:23.171
...give you...

56:23.338 --> 56:25.465
Give me what?

56:32.848 --> 56:34.432
Ludo!

56:34.600 --> 56:36.684
Smell!

56:36.852 --> 56:38.603
Where's Hoggle?

56:40.898 --> 56:42.857
Get off of me!

56:44.026 --> 56:45.485
Here.

56:47.196 --> 56:48.321
Hoggle.

56:48.489 --> 56:51.908
No, it's okay.
This is Ludo. He's a friend too.

56:52.076 --> 56:53.284
A what?

56:53.452 --> 56:55.119
Smell!

56:55.287 --> 56:56.662
You're right.

56:59.792 --> 57:02.210
Oh, my God.

57:05.255 --> 57:06.672
There's a bridge.

57:06.840 --> 57:08.633
Come on.

57:13.597 --> 57:14.639
Watch it.

57:14.807 --> 57:18.476
You step in this stuff
and you'll stink forever.

57:20.729 --> 57:21.813
Stop!

57:23.065 --> 57:25.942
- Stop, I say.
- Please, we have to get across.

57:26.110 --> 57:28.236
Without my permission,
no one may cross.

57:28.403 --> 57:31.405
Please, I only have
a little time left!

57:31.573 --> 57:33.658
We've gotta get out of this stench.

57:33.826 --> 57:35.910
Smell bad.

57:36.078 --> 57:38.830
- Stench? Of what speaketh thou?
- This smell.

57:40.582 --> 57:43.251
- I smell nothing.
- You're joking.

57:43.418 --> 57:46.129
But I live
by my sense of smell.

57:48.715 --> 57:52.760
The air is sweet and fragrant, and
none may pass without my permission!

57:52.928 --> 57:55.763
Smell bad.

57:55.931 --> 57:58.266
Get out of my way!

57:58.433 --> 58:01.310
I warn thee,
I'm sworn to do my duty!

58:03.063 --> 58:05.273
- Come on. Let us get across.
- Hold!

58:09.736 --> 58:12.155
Listen, I don't want to
have to hurt you.

58:12.322 --> 58:13.865
What are you doing?

58:14.032 --> 58:16.450
Let go of my staff, sir!

58:23.292 --> 58:26.878
All right then.
I can conquer this mountain.

58:48.817 --> 58:50.860
Thou must do better than that.

58:51.987 --> 58:54.197
Give up? Huh?

59:08.545 --> 59:09.754
Enough!

59:11.632 --> 59:14.383
Before this day, never have I
met my match in battle.

59:14.551 --> 59:19.055
Yet this noble knight
has fought me to a standstill.

59:19.223 --> 59:22.683
- Are you all right, Ludo?
- Smell!

59:22.851 --> 59:26.896
Sir Ludo, if that's thy name,
now I, Sir Didymus, yield to thee.

59:27.064 --> 59:29.899
Come, let us be brothers
henceforth...

59:30.067 --> 59:32.693
...and fight for the right as one!

59:34.696 --> 59:38.032
- Thank you very much.
- Ludo get brother.

59:38.200 --> 59:39.242
Steady.

59:40.494 --> 59:42.954
- Well met, Sir Ludo.
- Good. Come on.

59:43.121 --> 59:46.540
Wait a minute!
You forget my sacred vow, my lady.

59:46.708 --> 59:50.378
- I cannot let you pass.
- But you said Ludo is your brother.

59:50.545 --> 59:53.881
I have taken an oath,
and I must defend it to the death.

59:54.049 --> 59:56.717
- The smell!
- Okay.

59:56.885 --> 01:00:00.263
Let's handle this thing logically.
What exactly have you sworn?

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:04.433
I have sworn with my lifeblood
no one shall pass this way...

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.852
...without my permission.

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:12.358
Well, may we have your permission?

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:14.944
Well, I...

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:25.913
- Yes?
- Thank you, noble sir.

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:27.415
My lady.

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:33.921
Have no fear, sweet lady.

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:36.424
This bridge has lasted
for a thousand years.

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:49.061
- It seemed solid enough.
- Hoggle!

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:55.901
Fear not, fair maiden.
I will save thee.

01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:57.111
Somehow.

01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:03.284
Sir Ludo, canst thou sit by and howl
when yon maiden needs our help?

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:35.941
- That's incredible, Ludo.
- My brother!

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:38.319
Canst thou summon up
the very rocks?

01:01:38.487 --> 01:01:42.531
Sure. Rocks friends.

01:01:44.743 --> 01:01:46.243
Hoggle.

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:50.289
- Here.
- Thanks, Hoggle.

01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:56.212
Be careful, Ludo.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:05.388
Sir Ludo, wait for me.

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:09.725
Ambrosius, it's all right.
You can come out now.

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:13.354
Come on. Thattaboy.

01:02:13.522 --> 01:02:16.357
My loyal steed. Steady.

01:02:19.528 --> 01:02:22.488
Forward. Steady, boy.

01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:26.117
Come on, Ambrosius.
Just close your eyes and go.

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:31.831
Let's get out of here.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.545
Excuse us. Thank you.

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:46.887
<i>I wouldn't do that</i>
<i>if I were you.</i>

01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:50.516
Please, I can't give it to her.

01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:57.773
Come on then. We should reach
the castle well before day.

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:08.117
Look, Sarah, is this
what you're trying to find?

01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:14.290
So much trouble over such
a little thing, but not for long.

01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:18.836
She'll soon forget all about you,
my fine fellow.

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:22.047
Just as soon as Hoggle
gives her my present...

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:25.384
...then she'll forget everything.

01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:29.930
Is that my stomach or yours,
Ambrosius?

01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:32.725
Hungry.

01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:38.230
Yeah. Well, we can't stop now.

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:41.275
Maybe we can find
some berries or something.

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:43.444
Sarah.

01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:46.071
Yeah?

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:47.406
Here.

01:03:47.616 --> 01:03:52.286
Hoggle. Thank you!

01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:54.538
You're a lifesaver.

01:04:03.882 --> 01:04:05.508
This tastes strange.

01:04:13.975 --> 01:04:18.562
- Hoggle, what have you done?
- Damn you, Jareth.

01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:21.106
And damn me too.

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:34.495
Everything's dancing.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:42.771
Yea, verily.
Whoa, Ambrosius, whoa!

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:47.151
The castle doth lie yonder,
my lady.

01:05:47.319 --> 01:05:49.236
My lady?

01:05:49.404 --> 01:05:53.157
My lady? My lady?

01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:48.725
She'll never forgive me.

01:09:48.893 --> 01:09:50.894
What have I done?

01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:53.981
I've lost my only friend.

01:09:54.148 --> 01:09:56.191
That's what I've done.

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:08.662
What was I doing?

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:22.676
Get off my back!

01:10:25.179 --> 01:10:27.681
Why don't you look
where you're going...

01:10:27.849 --> 01:10:29.808
...young woman?

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:34.229
- I was looking.
- Huh? Huh?

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:37.357
Where were you going?

01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:39.151
I don't remember.

01:10:39.319 --> 01:10:42.529
You can't look where you're going
if you don't know where you're going.

01:10:42.697 --> 01:10:44.323
I was searching for something.

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:46.783
Well, look here.

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:54.082
Lancelot?

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:56.209
Thank you.

01:10:56.377 --> 01:11:00.756
That's what you were looking for.
Wasn't it, my dear?

01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:03.967
Yes. I forgot.

01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:07.054
Now, why don't you...

01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:09.389
...come in here...

01:11:09.557 --> 01:11:12.392
...and see if there's
anything else...

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.853
...you'd like.

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:47.386
It was just a dream.

01:11:50.098 --> 01:11:52.641
I dreamed it all, Lancelot.

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:56.979
But it was so real.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:02.776
Let's go see if Daddy's back,
okay?

01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:10.450
Better to stay in here, dear.
Yes.

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:14.955
There's nothing you want
out there. No! No.

01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:17.958
What have we got here?

01:12:18.126 --> 01:12:19.501
Lancelot.

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:23.005
Your bunny rabbit.
You like your little bunny rabbit.

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.465
Don't you? Yes, yes.
There you go.

01:12:25.633 --> 01:12:28.051
There's Betsy Boo.
You remember Betsy Boo, don't you?

01:12:28.219 --> 01:12:29.970
Yes, yes.

01:12:30.138 --> 01:12:33.473
Now then, what else have we got?
What's this? Let's have a look.

01:12:33.641 --> 01:12:36.184
It's a pencil box.
Got lots of pencils in it too.

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:40.689
Here's your panda slippers.
You know how much you like them.

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:44.317
You never wanted them thrown away.
There they are. That's right.

01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:48.113
Okay. Now then, what else?
It's little Horsy.

01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:50.615
You love little Horsy,
don't you, dear?

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:54.786
And look at this!
You got a printing game, you have.

01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:58.540
Here's a treasure.
You'll want that. Won't you, my dear?

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:02.461
Yes, go on. Put it on.
Make yourself up.

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:06.048
Here's dear old Flopsy.
You'll want her. There you go.

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:10.010
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

01:13:10.178 --> 01:13:13.847
Charlie Bear. Right.
There's Charlie Bear for you.

01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:15.849
There was something
I was looking for.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:19.728
Don't talk nonsense.
It's all here.

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:23.565
Everything you've
ever cared about is all right here.

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:26.026
There's your little toy candy shop.

01:13:26.194 --> 01:13:27.486
"Through dangers untold...

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:30.363
...and hardships unnumbered...

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:34.785
...I fought my way here
to the castle...

01:13:34.952 --> 01:13:37.496
...beyond the Goblin City...

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:40.957
...to take back the child
that you have stolen."

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:45.921
What's the matter, my dear?
Don't you like your toys?

01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:48.090
It's all junk.

01:13:49.717 --> 01:13:51.885
Well, what about this?

01:13:52.053 --> 01:13:55.931
This is not junk, eh?

01:13:56.891 --> 01:13:59.309
Yes, it is!

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:03.105
I have to save Toby!

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:08.902
My lady!

01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:14.366
- Sarah? Sarah.
- Are you all right?

01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:17.619
- My lady.
- Sarah.

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:22.499
Fair maiden. Thank goodness
thou art safe at last.

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:24.793
- Where are we?
- Sarah back.

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:27.295
My lady, we're almost there.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.840
Those are the gates
to the Goblin City.

01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:32.134
Ludo, Sir Didymus.

01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:35.929
Let's go quickly.
We don't have much time.

01:14:36.097 --> 01:14:38.306
- Yeah.
- Right, Ambrosius.

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:40.392
Forward.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.935
No, no!

01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:47.357
Open up. Open the door.

01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:49.651
Sir Didymus, we must go quietly.

01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:53.655
Open up. Open up right now!

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:55.240
You'll wake the guard.

01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:56.616
Quiet.

01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:59.536
Well, let them all wake up!

01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:03.623
I shall fight you all
to the death!

01:15:05.626 --> 01:15:08.962
Please, Sir Didymus,
for my sake, hush.

01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:11.173
But of course.
For thee, anything.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.633
- But I'm not a coward?
- No.

01:15:13.801 --> 01:15:15.844
- And my sense of smell is keen?
- Oh, yes.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:19.556
Then I shall fight anyone
anywhere, any place, anytime!

01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:21.474
We know!

01:15:21.642 --> 01:15:23.018
Now hush.

01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:27.022
Quietly.

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:29.608
Ambrosius, be quiet now.

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.195
I don't see why we
have to be so quiet.

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:35.488
It's only a Goblin City.

01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:37.532
I smell trouble.

01:15:43.331 --> 01:15:44.789
Come on, Ludo.

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:47.500
Oh, no.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.340
What is that?

01:15:57.386 --> 01:16:14.110
Who goes?

01:16:22.286 --> 01:16:23.912
Watch out!

01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:31.503
Ambrosius.

01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:39.886
Ambrosius, will you come here?

01:16:42.807 --> 01:16:44.808
Ambrosius, come here right now!

01:16:45.643 --> 01:16:48.270
Will you please come?
Oh, but you're embarrassing me.

01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:53.191
Ludo.

01:16:54.694 --> 01:16:55.986
Hoggle!

01:17:03.077 --> 01:17:05.120
Look out!

01:17:07.415 --> 01:17:09.457
Get out of there.

01:17:10.751 --> 01:17:12.711
What are you doing?

01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:16.089
Bombs away!

01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:21.636
That wasn't very nice.

01:17:23.431 --> 01:17:24.639
My turn now.

01:17:26.434 --> 01:17:28.601
How do you drive this thing?

01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:34.441
Drop the axe!

01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:36.776
I'm trying.

01:17:36.944 --> 01:17:39.946
Come here at once.

01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:44.326
Where's reverse?

01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:54.377
Get out of there, Hoggle!

01:17:54.545 --> 01:17:57.464
Abandon ship.

01:18:00.343 --> 01:18:02.135
Hoggle!

01:18:04.889 --> 01:18:07.098
Hoggle, are you all right?

01:18:08.225 --> 01:18:11.853
I'm not asking to be forgiven.
I ain't ashamed of nothing I did.

01:18:12.563 --> 01:18:15.440
Jareth made me give you
that peach.

01:18:15.608 --> 01:18:19.152
I don't care what you think of me.
I told you I was a coward.

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.279
I ain't interested
in being friends.

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:24.115
I forgive you, Hoggle.

01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:27.911
You...? You do?

01:18:29.163 --> 01:18:32.791
And I commend you.
Rarely have I seen such courage.

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:36.169
You are a valiant man,
Sir Hoggle.

01:18:36.337 --> 01:18:38.880
I am?

01:18:39.048 --> 01:18:41.466
Hoggle and Ludo friends.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.178
We are?

01:18:45.346 --> 01:18:46.846
Here are your things, Hoggle.

01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:49.391
Thanks for your help.

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:52.977
Well, what are we waiting for?

01:18:53.145 --> 01:18:55.563
Let's get the rat
who calls himself Jareth.

01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:57.190
Right. Come on.

01:18:57.358 --> 01:19:00.235
Ambrosius, it's safe now.
Nothing to be afraid of.

01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:29.472
Your Highness!

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.350
Your Highness, the girl...

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.102
- What?
...who ate the peach...

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:36.688
...and forgot everything...
- What of her?

01:19:36.856 --> 01:19:39.899
She's here with the monster,
Sir Didymus and the dwarf.

01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:42.944
- What?
- They're on their way to the castle!

01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:47.031
Stop her! Call out the guards.
Take the baby and hide it.

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:50.034
- Guards!
- She must be stopped.

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:51.327
Do something!

01:19:52.246 --> 01:19:55.415
Come on, move. Move!

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:08.178
- I think we're gonna make it.
- Piece of cake.

01:20:14.768 --> 01:20:17.812
Company, halt.

01:20:24.445 --> 01:20:27.363
Lances ready!

01:20:30.576 --> 01:20:32.577
Cannon, fire!

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:41.294
Ambrosius, turn around.
Turn about.

01:20:41.462 --> 01:20:44.172
- Quick, this way.
- All right. Charge!

01:20:45.799 --> 01:20:47.800
No, not that way!

01:20:49.595 --> 01:20:52.972
You're going the wrong way!

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:55.016
The battle's behind us!

01:20:58.979 --> 01:21:02.732
Ambrosius, can we please
talk about this?

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:04.317
Sit!

01:21:08.822 --> 01:21:11.324
Be careful. Okay.

01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:12.867
Through here.

01:21:15.663 --> 01:21:19.332
Ambrosius, stand still.

01:21:20.251 --> 01:21:22.168
Okay, come on, guys.

01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:26.464
Ambrosius, if you don't
turn around this second...

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:29.384
...I will never feed you again.

01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:33.388
That's better.

01:21:34.848 --> 01:21:37.684
Don't worry, Ambrosius.
I think we've got them surrounded.

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:43.356
Didymus! Where's Didymus?

01:21:43.524 --> 01:21:45.900
Fire!

01:21:47.987 --> 01:21:49.904
I hit something, yes? No?

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:53.741
We've got to find Didymus.

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:57.662
Down this way.

01:22:15.014 --> 01:22:17.890
Charge!

01:22:25.316 --> 01:22:26.733
Tallyho!

01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:33.197
Ambrosius, you coward.

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:45.585
Quick, in here.

01:22:45.753 --> 01:22:47.545
How's Ludo gonna get in?

01:23:09.276 --> 01:23:11.402
You in there, you're surrounded!

01:23:12.279 --> 01:23:13.988
Surrounded?

01:23:15.866 --> 01:23:19.118
Get out!
Ludo, hold the roof!

01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:34.133
- Take that!
- Hungry? All right.

01:23:35.719 --> 01:23:37.804
Ludo?

01:23:37.971 --> 01:23:40.848
Ambrosius, unlock this door.

01:23:46.730 --> 01:23:49.190
So had enough, have you?

01:23:49.358 --> 01:23:53.945
Then throw down your weapons,
and I'll see that you're well-treated.

01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:58.074
Ludo!

01:24:21.515 --> 01:24:23.474
Next time, surrender.

01:24:33.152 --> 01:24:35.319
Good grief!

01:24:40.492 --> 01:24:41.576
Steady, men.

01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:46.456
Steady, men. Hold your ground.

01:24:51.211 --> 01:24:54.213
Okay, I take it back.
Run for your lives!

01:24:54.381 --> 01:24:57.550
I've had enough!
I'm going to bed.

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.721
Get out of my house!

01:25:23.869 --> 01:25:26.162
Whoa, Nellie! Duck!

01:25:29.166 --> 01:25:30.458
Missed!

01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:32.418
Okay, come on.

01:25:34.922 --> 01:25:36.339
Fire!

01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:40.843
Hey, I just fired you.

01:25:45.682 --> 01:25:47.099
This way.

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:52.647
Now we have you!

01:25:54.858 --> 01:25:56.275
And now you don't.

01:26:13.752 --> 01:26:15.878
Hey, no problem.

01:26:19.341 --> 01:26:22.009
- Sir Didymus!
- Coming!

01:26:24.304 --> 01:26:26.973
Hi-ho, Silver!

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:40.486
- Whoa, boy. Whoa, big fella.
- This way.

01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:42.071
Steady, boy.

01:26:43.991 --> 01:26:47.326
Yes. Up we go. Up, up.

01:26:49.621 --> 01:26:51.497
Come on. Good boy.

01:26:51.665 --> 01:26:53.499
Come on.

01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:54.834
No.

01:26:55.002 --> 01:26:56.836
Good boy. Come on.

01:26:58.297 --> 01:27:01.382
- That's the only way he could've gone.
- Well then, come on.

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:04.886
- I have to face him alone.
- But why?

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:07.096
Because that's the way it's done.

01:27:07.264 --> 01:27:09.724
Well, if that is the way
it is done...

01:27:09.892 --> 01:27:12.059
...then that is the way
you must do it.

01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:15.021
But should you need us...

01:27:15.939 --> 01:27:18.232
Yes, should you need us...

01:27:19.359 --> 01:27:20.776
I'll call.

01:27:21.862 --> 01:27:23.696
Thank you, all of you.

01:28:45.862 --> 01:29:55.556
Toby!

01:29:58.977 --> 01:30:00.853
Toby.

01:30:18.413 --> 01:30:20.456
Toby!

01:30:56.535 --> 01:30:58.410
Give me the child.

01:30:58.578 --> 01:31:00.788
Sarah, beware.

01:31:00.956 --> 01:31:05.084
I have been generous up until now,
and I can be cruel.

01:31:05.252 --> 01:31:06.669
Generous?

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:12.133
- What have you done that's generous?
- Everything!

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:15.136
Everything that you wanted,
I have done.

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:19.140
You asked that the child be taken.
I took him.

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:22.518
You cowered before me.
I was frightening.

01:31:22.686 --> 01:31:24.937
I have reordered time...

01:31:25.105 --> 01:31:27.773
...I have turned the world
upside down...

01:31:27.941 --> 01:31:30.484
...and I have done it all for you.

01:31:32.112 --> 01:31:36.031
I am exhausted from living up
to your expectations of me.

01:31:36.199 --> 01:31:37.366
Isn't that generous?

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:44.165
Through dangers untold
and hardships unnumbered...

01:31:45.667 --> 01:31:49.503
...I have fought my way here to
the castle beyond the Goblin City.

01:31:52.215 --> 01:31:54.133
For my will
is as strong as yours...

01:31:55.427 --> 01:31:58.387
...and my...
- Stop. Wait.

01:31:58.555 --> 01:32:00.097
Look, Sarah.

01:32:00.265 --> 01:32:03.851
Look what I'm offering you.

01:32:04.019 --> 01:32:05.477
Your dreams.

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:10.191
And my kingdom as great.

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:13.110
I ask for so little.

01:32:13.278 --> 01:32:15.696
Just let me rule you...

01:32:15.864 --> 01:32:19.283
...and you can have everything
that you want.

01:32:21.995 --> 01:32:25.456
Kingdom as great.

01:32:25.624 --> 01:32:26.832
Damn.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.168
I can never remember that line.

01:32:29.336 --> 01:32:33.047
Just fear me, love me,
do as I say...

01:32:33.215 --> 01:32:35.591
...and I will be your slave.

01:32:36.635 --> 01:32:40.721
My kingdom as great.
My kingdom as great.

01:32:47.395 --> 01:32:54.693
You have no power over me.

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:39.947
Toby.

01:33:41.324 --> 01:33:44.410
Toby? Toby?

01:33:45.078 --> 01:33:46.954
Toby?

01:34:15.317 --> 01:34:18.068
Here you are.

01:34:18.236 --> 01:34:21.155
I'd like Lancelot
to belong to you now.

01:34:44.596 --> 01:34:46.013
We're home.

01:34:52.812 --> 01:34:54.855
Sarah, are you home?

01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:58.192
Yeah. Yes, I'm home.

01:35:01.363 --> 01:35:03.322
Goodbye, Sarah.

01:35:12.999 --> 01:35:14.458
Remember, fair maiden...

01:35:14.626 --> 01:35:16.502
...should you need us...

01:35:17.712 --> 01:35:19.880
Yes, should you need us...

01:35:20.048 --> 01:35:22.841
...for any reason at all...

01:35:23.009 --> 01:35:25.386
I need you, Hoggle.

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:26.970
You do?

01:35:28.306 --> 01:35:30.724
I don't know why, but...

01:35:30.892 --> 01:35:33.394
...every now and again
in my life...

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.855
...for no reason at all,
I need you.

01:35:37.023 --> 01:35:38.857
All of you.

01:35:39.025 --> 01:35:40.609
You do?

01:35:40.777 --> 01:35:44.071
Well, why didn't you say so?

01:35:55.458 --> 01:35:57.543
- Ludo!
- Sarah.

01:35:57.710 --> 01:36:01.296
Ambrosius,
good boy, good boy.

01:36:08.304 --> 01:36:10.931
I say, does anyone here
want to play a game of Scrabble?

01:36:32.787 --> 01:36:34.496
<i>- You remind me of the babe.</i>
<i>- What babe?</i>

01:36:34.664 --> 01:36:36.331
<i>- The babe with the power.</i>
<i>- What power?</i>

01:36:36.499 --> 01:36:38.000
<i>- The power of voodoo.</i>
<i>- Who do?</i>

01:36:38.168 --> 01:36:39.209
<i>- You do.</i>
<i>- Do what?</i>

01:36:39.377 --> 01:36:41.962
<i>Remind me of the babe.</i>

01:36:42.305 --> 01:36:48.424
