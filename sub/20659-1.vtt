Why am I so obsessed
with Jeff?

18:37.825 --> 18:41.078
- [whimpers]
But I'm scared.

18:41.161 --> 18:41.703
- Oh, it's okay, buddy.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.706
It's just water.
See?

18:44.790 --> 18:46.500
It's not gonna hurt ya.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.710
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

18:48.794 --> 18:52.297
- Gotta hand it to him, man,
he was pretty tough.

18:52.381 --> 18:55.050
But nobody survives
a shanking from Jose.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.803
- [gasps]
all: Oh!

18:59.096 --> 19:02.558
- I mean, how inept
can the police be?

19:02.641 --> 19:04.560
- Yeah. Pretty hard to be
a murderer

19:04.643 --> 19:06.979
if your victims
are all alive and well.

19:07.062 --> 19:10.148
{\an1}- I'm telling you guys,
the system is broken.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.400
- Jeez.
- So, Dad, you down to hit

19:11.483 --> 19:12.985
Ragtime Fest next week?

19:13.068 --> 19:14.945
- Does Scott Joplin
use a 2/4 time signature?

19:15.028 --> 19:18.782
{\an1}- [chuckles]
Well, you know,

19:18.866 --> 19:20.242
at the end of the day,

19:20.325 --> 19:23.495
{\an1}this all worked out great
for everyone.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.747
{\an1}- So, where were you,
Grandma?

19:25.831 --> 19:27.916
- I was in hell.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.878
But instead of demons,
there were aliens

19:30.961 --> 19:34.089
and they made me wear a horrible
jacket made of pubic hair.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.966
- Once they get to this level
of dementia,

19:36.049 --> 19:37.384
there's really nothing
we can do.

19:41.513 --> 19:44.391
- 48. Wow, man, 49.

19:44.474 --> 19:45.809
- Hey, friends.
- [grunts]

19:45.893 --> 19:47.686
- You're all getting raises
because I appreciate you.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.980
- Yeah!
- Nice!

19:50.063 --> 19:51.773
{\an3}- Oh, and I'm not going to be
here anymore

19:51.857 --> 19:53.567
on Tuesdays and Fridays

19:53.650 --> 19:56.111
{\an3}because I'm starting
intensive therapy.

19:56.194 --> 20:00.115
{\an3}I-I believe something
is terribly wrong with me.

20:00.198 --> 20:03.660
- Uh, okay, well,
thanks for the raise, man.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.913
{\an3}- Jeff, did you do something
different with your hair?

20:05.996 --> 20:07.748
- Uh...
- I like it.

20:07.831 --> 20:10.834
- Thank you.

20:23.805 --> 20:26.850
[muffled] Hey, guys, I just
wanted to say thanks so much

20:26.934 --> 20:30.562
for respecting the new towel
rule, it means a lot.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.480
[all gasping]
- Jeff!

20:31.563 --> 20:33.815
What is my butt brush
doing in your mouth?

20:33.899 --> 20:34.691
- Your what brush?
- Grossy grossers!

20:34.775 --> 20:36.234
- Ugh! God!

20:36.318 --> 20:38.028
{\an3}That means I've been getting
your filthy mouth germs

20:38.111 --> 20:39.029
all over my butt.
- Ugh.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.657
{\an1}How long has this
been going on?

20:41.740 --> 20:43.158
- No!
I'm the one that's upset.

20:43.241 --> 20:44.993
This is my toothbrush.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.120
{\an1}- No! This is your toothbrush,
you [bleep] idiot.

20:47.204 --> 20:50.332
{\an1}Right where you left it,
in the toothbrush cup.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.168
{\an3}- Talk about disrespecting
other people's stuff.

{\an3}- Cut.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.345
