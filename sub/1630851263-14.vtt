00:30.813 --> 00:32.075
What are we doing here, Robin?

00:32.119 --> 00:33.990
- Are we going the fishing?
- Nope.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.948
- Doing some whale watching?
- Nuh-uh.

00:35.992 --> 00:37.646
Hitting up the maritime museum?

00:37.689 --> 00:39.430
No.

00:39.474 --> 00:42.433
Titans, we are here
for a far more
important reason.

00:42.477 --> 00:44.783
We are going on a cruise.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.052
I love
being trapped on a boat.

00:52.095 --> 00:56.621
Welcome Titans, to the
Trans Oceanic Magical Cruise.

00:56.665 --> 00:58.275
Or the T-O-M Cruise for short.

00:58.319 --> 01:01.191
Whoa! Check this place out.

01:01.235 --> 01:04.194
It's got a stage show
with a real life vampire.

01:04.238 --> 01:07.067
And a legendary petting zoo.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.808
And an awesome race track.

01:09.852 --> 01:11.549
Well, if you think that's cool,

01:11.593 --> 01:13.769
check out
the Impossible Buffet.

01:13.812 --> 01:15.553
Oh, yeah!

01:15.597 --> 01:18.382
I'mma get me a cheeseburger-
lobster-rib steak-apple pie.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.907
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:21.951 --> 01:24.060
You can't just go waltzing in
to the Impossible Buffet.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.086
Why not?

01:26.129 --> 01:28.325
Because it's guarded
by the world's most advanced
security system.

01:28.349 --> 01:32.440
And one false move could
get you blown to smithereens.

01:38.750 --> 01:41.188
Thank you for visiting
the Impossible Buffet.

01:41.231 --> 01:44.016
Whoa, isn't that
a little extreme for a buffet?

01:44.060 --> 01:47.542
Everything the T-O-M Cruise
does is a little extreme.

01:47.585 --> 01:51.763
So how does one gain access
to the Impossible Buffet?

01:51.807 --> 01:53.939
Through that
small vent in the ceiling.

01:53.983 --> 01:57.813
Ooh! Getting in there sounds
like an impossible mission.

01:57.856 --> 01:59.423
Yeah, let's do this.

02:00.946 --> 02:02.992
Robin, I can lower you down
using this.

02:05.429 --> 02:07.127
Sounds good, but be careful.

02:07.170 --> 02:09.259
Yeah, yeah
just get in the hole.

02:09.303 --> 02:11.392
Easy, a little to the left.

02:11.435 --> 02:12.610
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:12.654 --> 02:13.872
A little to the right.

02:14.743 --> 02:15.743
Perfect.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.184
Come on, man.

02:21.228 --> 02:22.968
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

02:23.012 --> 02:25.188
Yeah, no way he can
carry that much food

02:25.232 --> 02:26.842
with his tiny,
little baby hands.

02:26.885 --> 02:28.539
I do not have baby hands.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.106
Step aside, my dude,

02:30.150 --> 02:31.470
and let me
show you how it's done.

02:34.328 --> 02:35.851
Careful!

02:35.894 --> 02:38.027
Hush your mouth, fool,
and grab me some muffins.

02:43.119 --> 02:45.513
Oh, give me a break, bro,
you had that.

02:45.556 --> 02:47.167
Let's go again.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.690
No way, you just went.

02:48.733 --> 02:51.345
-Oh! Oh!
I wish to have the turn.
Me too!

02:52.346 --> 02:53.651
Cut it out up there.

02:56.306 --> 02:57.481
Ow! I got some food.

02:57.525 --> 02:58.569
Now pull me up.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.220
What you get?
What you get?

03:02.443 --> 03:04.662
A lousy French fry?

03:04.706 --> 03:06.751
Don't nobody want your
sad looking fry.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.710
Where are we gonna eat now?

03:08.753 --> 03:11.103
Well, the theater
probably has snacks.

03:15.804 --> 03:18.110
- Raven, you're a genius, girl.
- Great.

03:18.154 --> 03:20.374
Now keep it down.
I really wanna see this play.

03:20.417 --> 03:21.766
What's the name of it?

03:21.810 --> 03:23.464
Ooh! <i>Interview With
a Bloodsucker.</i>

03:23.507 --> 03:25.988
Ooh! Sounds so terrifying.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.512
Yeah, that sounds
super scary, yo.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.647
Welcome, Mr. Vampire.

03:32.690 --> 03:35.040
What job are you
interviewing for today?

03:35.084 --> 03:37.782
I wanna be a dance instructor.

03:37.826 --> 03:39.871
Tell me,
why should I hire you?

03:39.915 --> 03:42.265
I have just
always wanted to teach dance.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.006
You know, I gotta dance.

03:44.049 --> 03:45.834
Everybody just
keeps biting people.

03:45.877 --> 03:48.532
I was just, like,
"It's about the dance, man."

03:48.576 --> 03:50.360
Aw, mans, this ain't scary.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.275
It's just a straight-up
job interview.

03:52.319 --> 03:54.016
I cannot watch this.

03:54.059 --> 03:56.497
- Let's bounce, yo.
- I'm gonna hang back.

03:56.540 --> 03:59.456
I'm a real sucker
when it comes to vampires.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.544
Ha-ha.

04:02.546 --> 04:03.852
Well, that was a bust.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.462
No doubt. What now?

04:05.506 --> 04:07.116
What do you
wanna do next, yo?

04:07.159 --> 04:10.380
Perhaps we could visit the
legendary petting zoo.

04:10.424 --> 04:12.339
Sure, but you go ahead.

04:12.382 --> 04:15.516
- I need a minute alone with
Cyborg and Beast Boy.
- Okay.

04:15.559 --> 04:17.518
Listen, guys,

04:17.561 --> 04:18.886
I think this cruise
is the perfect
and most romantic place

04:18.910 --> 04:21.043
to tell Starfire
how much I care for her.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.914
Oh, I get it.

04:22.958 --> 04:26.875
You want to turn this ship into
your own personal love boat.

04:26.918 --> 04:29.007
So exciting and new.

04:29.051 --> 04:32.228
Exactly, but it's
never going to happen
with you two hanging around.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.535
No problemo, yo.
We'll gets lost.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.363
But first you gots
to show us the money.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.190
Excuse me?

04:38.234 --> 04:40.845
You heard the man. If you want
us gone, you gotta pay up.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.325
Seriously?

04:42.369 --> 04:45.328
Say it with me one time,
"Show us the money."

04:45.372 --> 04:47.939
Show us the money.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.941
Now it say
all proper like Alfred.

04:49.985 --> 04:51.813
Show us the money.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.119
Now dark and gritty
like Batman.

04:54.163 --> 04:55.904
Show us the money.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.340
Now say it like Starfire.

04:57.384 --> 05:00.909
Glorious! The show,
the us, the money.

05:00.952 --> 05:03.520
You are over
the edge, baby.

05:03.564 --> 05:05.217
And I love that about you.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.352
Now take this
and get out of here.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.311
A pleasure
doing business with you, bro.

05:11.354 --> 05:12.354
Hey!

05:14.444 --> 05:19.362
Oh! There are so many
of the wonderful animals here.

05:28.415 --> 05:29.677
Listen, Star,

05:29.720 --> 05:31.243
I'm really
nervous to tell you this,

05:31.287 --> 05:32.593
so I'm just gonna say it.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.682
You complete...

05:35.987 --> 05:38.686
Well, hello there,
Mr. Unicorn.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.427
Aren't you the adorable?

05:40.470 --> 05:43.691
I shall name you
the Sugarcone.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.433
Get lost, Sugarcone.

05:46.476 --> 05:48.086
I'm trying to say
something important.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.742
You complete...

05:54.266 --> 05:56.704
Yo, we definitely
gots to try this.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.488
Okay, but I warn you

05:58.532 --> 06:00.142
when it comes to driving,

06:00.185 --> 06:02.144
I'm an underdog
looking for something to prove.

06:02.187 --> 06:04.364
Oh, yeah?
Well, when it comes to flying,

06:04.407 --> 06:06.757
I'm an underdog
looking for something to prove.

06:06.801 --> 06:10.805
Then let's race to see
who's the most underdoggiest
underdog there is.

06:10.848 --> 06:12.589
I'm in.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.929
I got the need for speed.

06:53.151 --> 06:54.152
Yo, hey!

06:56.546 --> 06:57.982
So you wanna play rough?

07:03.248 --> 07:04.641
Where did he go?

07:04.685 --> 07:05.903
I'm right here, bro.

07:05.947 --> 07:07.339
Smile for the camera.

07:09.603 --> 07:10.952
See you at the finish line.

07:10.995 --> 07:12.257
We'll just see about that.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.177
He's got me on missile lock.

07:19.221 --> 07:21.179
Good thing I brought
a little collateral.

07:24.966 --> 07:26.402
Goose!

07:26.446 --> 07:27.534
That tears it.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.668
Man, that's a life saver.

07:31.712 --> 07:34.889
Oh, yeah? Well, ain't nothing
gonna save you from this.

07:53.211 --> 07:55.910
Oh, mans.

07:55.953 --> 07:59.304
Now, we'll never know
the answer to who
the true underdog is.

07:59.348 --> 08:04.527
- You wants the answer?
- I want the truth.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.573
We's both true underdogs.

08:06.616 --> 08:07.835
What?

08:07.878 --> 08:09.401
We're never gonna win!

08:12.448 --> 08:14.842
This T-O-M Cruise is the best.

08:14.885 --> 08:18.236
I'm so glad we got
a chance to take this vacation.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.281
It is pretty great.

08:20.151 --> 08:21.544
Yes, it is.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.894
- Except for the aliens.
- What aliens?

08:45.133 --> 08:47.396
Ahhh! Why they's
attacking us?

08:47.439 --> 08:50.834
Because, the T-O-M Cruise
always gets attacked by aliens.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.532
And you knew this?

08:52.575 --> 08:54.838
Of course.
It's why I booked this cruise.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.579
So we can put a stop to it.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.601
But we don't have enough power
to stop those things.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.104
Yes, we do.

09:00.148 --> 09:04.021
We can use the power
of the T-O-M Cruise!

09:04.065 --> 09:05.545
Aw, yeah!

09:25.173 --> 09:26.609
Spin and hold and flip,

09:26.653 --> 09:28.176
spin and launch.

09:28.219 --> 09:30.221
<i>♪ Dance instructor</i>

09:53.462 --> 09:55.986
I's going to send
you aliens into <i>Oblivion.</i>

09:58.685 --> 10:01.470
Beast Boy, get me close enough
to plant this bomb.

10:01.513 --> 10:03.080
Roger that.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.779
Oh, sorry, bro.

10:07.345 --> 10:08.390
My bad.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.610
Stop, stop, stop.

10:12.394 --> 10:14.309
Don't worry, bro,
I got this.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.451
Nice work, Titans.
We did it.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.105
Them aliens
weren't so tough,

10:28.149 --> 10:30.238
I could beat them
with my <i>Eyes Wide Shut.</i>

10:30.281 --> 10:33.720
We kicked their alien booties <i>
Far and Away.</i>

10:33.763 --> 10:36.592
And straight into
the <i>Edge of Tomorrow.</i>

10:37.898 --> 10:40.074
Did you hear that <i>
Tropic Thunder?</i>

10:40.117 --> 10:42.337
Just a second ago it was
a <i>Vanilla Sky.</i>

10:42.380 --> 10:44.034
Now the difference is <i>
Knight and Day.</i>

10:44.078 --> 10:46.123
We better get below deck
before it storms.

10:46.167 --> 10:49.649
No need to be so <i>
The Firm,</i> Robin.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.694
Yeah, it's just
a little <i>Rain Man.</i>

10:51.738 --> 10:55.872
That's not rain coming from
those <i>Magnolia</i> shaped clouds.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.700
It's frogs.

11:02.226 --> 11:05.055
This T-O-M Cruise is nuts, man.
