00:12.768 --> 00:13.933
Will!

00:13.933 --> 00:15.534
Clara, what are you still doing here?

00:15.534 --> 00:16.601
I thought you were going to evacuate

00:16.601 --> 00:17.634
with the other residents.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.634
She wasn't supposed to be here.

00:23.701 --> 00:26.501
Ashley, please...

00:26.501 --> 00:29.668
Mom...

00:59.734 --> 01:00.701
Helen?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.733
It's a miracle.

01:10.501 --> 01:12.467
Ashley?

01:12.467 --> 01:15.234
Mom...

01:17.601 --> 01:18.701
Welcome home.

01:23.567 --> 01:24.668
Hmm.

01:28.634 --> 01:30.334
The repairs on the beijing sanctuary

01:30.334 --> 01:31.867
will be finished in March.

01:31.867 --> 01:33.267
And how long

01:33.267 --> 01:34.367
before the Moscow and London sanctuaries

01:34.367 --> 01:35.401
are reopened?

01:35.401 --> 01:36.634
Three months,

01:36.634 --> 01:38.267
Provided the contractors hold to their estimates.

01:38.267 --> 01:40.867
Tokyo, however, is a total loss.

01:40.867 --> 01:41.967
Which means we have

01:41.967 --> 01:43.701
a lot of dispossessed residents to deal with.

01:43.701 --> 01:46.401
The sanctuary network survived.

01:46.401 --> 01:48.067
That's what matters most.

01:48.067 --> 01:50.967
It's just...

01:50.967 --> 01:52.900
hard to keep that in mind sometimes.

01:52.900 --> 01:57.401
Yes. Clara.

01:57.401 --> 01:58.800
So many tragedies to process.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.000
I take it that's our cargo.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.301
No, ours is in the hold.

02:02.301 --> 02:05.734
Okay, well, I've got five trucks waiting, so...

02:05.734 --> 02:07.334
And the rest?

02:07.334 --> 02:10.768
Magnus said you requested space
for 20 abnormal refugees.

02:10.768 --> 02:12.067
Not 20 abnormals...

02:12.067 --> 02:14.634
20 containers of abnormals.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.467
Oh...

02:32.833 --> 02:35.634
Whoo-hoo! I can see the light.

02:36.668 --> 02:38.967
Oh!

02:38.967 --> 02:40.900
Now, that's better.

02:40.900 --> 02:42.434
Whoo, man, was it hot in there!

02:42.434 --> 02:44.000
Boy, I could sure do with a lemonade.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Yo, Beijing, what's a guy gotta do

02:46.000 --> 02:47.467
to get a cold drink around here, huh?

02:47.467 --> 02:49.567
Huh?

02:49.567 --> 02:50.933
Ooh, you're a lot of help.

02:50.933 --> 02:52.933
I'm out of here. See you.

02:57.800 --> 03:01.501
We're going to need some more trucks.

03:51.401 --> 03:52.601
Stop doting on me.

03:52.601 --> 03:54.034
It makes my teeth itch.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.234
Mine too.

03:55.234 --> 03:57.167
Now, eat.

03:57.167 --> 03:59.067
I should be helping Henry and Will.

03:59.067 --> 04:00.501
Oh, they're fine.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.601
Everything's running smooth as silk.

04:09.634 --> 04:11.200
Oh, no, you don't.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.367
Okay...

04:13.367 --> 04:15.367
This is a freaking mess.

04:15.367 --> 04:16.899
Whoa!

04:16.899 --> 04:18.367
So many wonderful guests!

04:18.367 --> 04:20.601
You know, we got to figure out
a tagging system or something,

04:20.601 --> 04:21.966
'cause half these things

04:21.966 --> 04:23.301
shouldn't even be breathing the same air.

04:23.301 --> 04:24.501
Whoo!

04:24.501 --> 04:25.567
Hey!

04:25.567 --> 04:27.167
Whoa...

04:27.167 --> 04:28.634
Come on, come and get it, shorty!

04:28.634 --> 04:30.634
I'm short?

04:30.634 --> 04:33.034
Okay, so all grade four security
risks are in the shoe.

04:33.034 --> 04:34.301
How's the food and water holding up?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.167
Hey, down, smithers.

04:37.167 --> 04:38.234
Git...

04:39.933 --> 04:41.467
All right. yeah,

04:41.467 --> 04:42.867
I pulled in big favors from our suppliers.

04:42.867 --> 04:44.367
Got, um... 

04:46.100 --> 04:47.134
Whoa...

04:47.134 --> 04:48.501
Yeah, he's... he's not well.

04:48.501 --> 04:50.334
Oh, god...

04:50.334 --> 04:52.000
I hope the plumbing holds up.

04:55.501 --> 04:56.967
Yeah, it's not the plumbing I'm worried about.

04:56.967 --> 04:59.100
Magnus isn't letting me reset the EM shield.

04:59.100 --> 05:00.534
It's still set to high security mode.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.000
You have any idea what kind of drain that is

05:02.000 --> 05:03.334
on our electrical system?

05:03.334 --> 05:04.634
Well, I'm sure Magnus is not overly concerned

05:04.634 --> 05:05.501
about the utility bill right now.

05:05.501 --> 05:07.000
No, I know.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.100
I'm just saying,

05:08.100 --> 05:08.967
we can't even plug in a toaster right now

05:08.967 --> 05:10.301
without blowing a fuse.

05:10.301 --> 05:12.301
I got 15 guests on the upper levels.

05:12.301 --> 05:14.134
I got another dozen in trucks waiting for rooms... 

05:14.134 --> 05:15.601
Henry, Henry, look. I know, okay?

05:15.601 --> 05:18.367
Everything's a mess right
now, but we can handle it.

05:18.367 --> 05:20.267
Really? Well, tell that to the
12 guys waiting in the... 

05:20.267 --> 05:21.467
Dude.

05:21.467 --> 05:22.334
We can handle it, okay?

05:22.334 --> 05:25.267
Let's just give 110%

05:25.267 --> 05:27.301
And take it one game at a time.

05:27.301 --> 05:28.567
Okay, one game at a time.

05:28.567 --> 05:29.701
It's time for you to be the man.

05:29.701 --> 05:30.401
Be the man. look out!

05:31.367 --> 05:32.601
Smithers, come on!

05:32.601 --> 05:33.634
Would you... could you... 

05:33.634 --> 05:35.367
Sorry... about him.

05:36.701 --> 05:39.967
All right, be the man.

05:39.967 --> 05:41.567
Be the man...

05:49.301 --> 05:51.701
Hmm...

05:51.701 --> 05:54.967
Good times.

05:58.234 --> 05:59.267
Hey.

06:01.301 --> 06:03.234
Wow...

06:03.234 --> 06:04.434
See, this is why we ask

06:04.434 --> 06:05.534
for a cleaning deposit from you

06:05.534 --> 06:06.601
when you check in.

06:06.601 --> 06:08.367
Ha ha.

06:08.367 --> 06:10.167
So you're really going, huh?

06:10.167 --> 06:12.967
Well, I can't exactly stay.

06:12.967 --> 06:14.701
I mean, the whole attack on this place,

06:14.701 --> 06:16.167
me shooting the boss' kid with a rocket,

06:16.167 --> 06:18.534
the kid going boom...

06:18.534 --> 06:22.067
things are just too, uh...

06:22.067 --> 06:24.067
weird now.

06:25.567 --> 06:27.734
Things are usually weird
around here,

06:27.734 --> 06:29.301
but I agree, they're especially weird right now.

06:29.301 --> 06:32.000
Look, I appreciate you guys

06:32.000 --> 06:33.401
letting me stay here as long as you have,

06:33.401 --> 06:35.100
but you need room at the inn, so... 

06:35.100 --> 06:37.167
Kate, do you want to stay here?

06:38.701 --> 06:41.567
No.

06:41.567 --> 06:42.933
Why do you ask?

06:42.933 --> 06:45.567
Well, you've taken your sweet time leaving.

06:45.567 --> 06:47.167
You've obviously made yourself at home.

06:47.167 --> 06:50.000
I don't know.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.367
Well, the leg's still a bit stiff.

06:53.367 --> 06:55.200
I was planning on waiting
until I was in peak condition

06:55.200 --> 06:56.267
before shipping out.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.467
Whatever.

07:01.467 --> 07:03.467
Look, if you're leaving, clean the place up,

07:03.467 --> 07:04.768
and if you're staying,

07:04.768 --> 07:06.267
clean the place up.

07:06.267 --> 07:07.334
Yeah, yeah.

07:07.334 --> 07:08.200
Garbage pickup's at 4:00.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.134
Good to know.

07:10.134 --> 07:11.367
"Garbage pickup is at 4:00."

07:41.434 --> 07:42.501
Okay, just stop.

07:42.501 --> 07:46.567
Stop being an idiot, all right?

07:46.567 --> 07:48.501
Are we going to do this now?

07:48.501 --> 07:49.867
Are we going to do this now?

07:49.867 --> 07:51.134
Okay, fine, and don't bare your teeth at me!

07:51.134 --> 07:52.200
I know what that means when you do that!

07:52.200 --> 07:54.601
Please, Will,

07:54.601 --> 07:57.267
come in.

07:57.267 --> 07:59.134
We'll discuss this later.

07:59.134 --> 08:00.334
God...

08:03.701 --> 08:06.501
I know you've had your hands full,

08:06.501 --> 08:09.734
and I really appreciate you
all giving me some time,

08:09.734 --> 08:11.501
but I'm hardly the only one

08:11.501 --> 08:14.734
personally affected by recent events.

08:14.734 --> 08:17.167
We haven't spoken since
Clara's memorial service.

08:17.167 --> 08:19.833
Yeah, which was five days ago.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.768
Magnus, what happened was...

08:23.768 --> 08:25.167
the worst thing

08:25.167 --> 08:27.567
I could possibly imagine,

08:27.567 --> 08:29.301
but it happened,

08:29.301 --> 08:30.734
and you mourning Ashley alone

08:30.734 --> 08:32.200
is not going to do yourself

08:32.200 --> 08:33.567
or anyone else any good.

08:33.567 --> 08:34.701
All righ without closure... 

08:34.701 --> 08:35.832
I know all of that, Will.

08:38.234 --> 08:39.668
Then why are you delaying the inevitable?

08:39.668 --> 08:40.799
Why are you hiding in here?

08:40.799 --> 08:43.200
Simple or complicated version?

08:43.200 --> 08:46.100
Your choice.

08:46.100 --> 08:47.501
What are you doing?

08:47.501 --> 08:50.234
I've wanted to tell you exactly that for days, Will,

08:50.234 --> 08:52.701
but I had to be sure,

08:52.701 --> 08:53.833
and now I am.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.833
Of what?

08:55.833 --> 08:58.668
I'm not mourning anything,

08:58.668 --> 08:59.734
not yet...

09:01.467 --> 09:04.401
because I believe there's a very real chance

09:04.401 --> 09:06.234
that Ashley may still be alive.

09:09.601 --> 09:13.701
Is that a real, live stenopelhabilis?

09:13.701 --> 09:16.601
Not so much alive as dead.

09:16.601 --> 09:18.100
These two were the last of their kind.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.167
They bought when London was hit.

09:20.167 --> 09:21.401
I didn't even know

09:21.401 --> 09:22.800
there was any left in existence.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.800
There are many species under our care

09:24.800 --> 09:26.034
we prefer people to believe are extinct.

09:26.034 --> 09:29.000
No way, you had a male and  a female?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.434
We were trying to breed them.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.334
Dr. Magnus wanted them
brought here for study,

09:35.334 --> 09:37.167
And safekeeping.

09:37.167 --> 09:38.800
What?

09:38.800 --> 09:41.467
Well, you don't think I know about the tusks?

09:41.467 --> 09:44.367
That's all you see, isn't it?

09:44.367 --> 09:45.867
Dude, do you know how much those are worth

09:45.867 --> 09:47.900
on the European market alone?

09:47.900 --> 09:49.734
And I'm talking for each pair.

09:49.734 --> 09:51.800
Forget about Asia, that'd be, like, double the... 

09:51.800 --> 09:52.900
Who are you?

09:52.900 --> 09:55.933
Ark-Fong Li, head of the Beijing Sanctuary,

09:55.933 --> 09:57.434
Meet Kate Freelander,

09:57.434 --> 09:58.800
professional pain in the ass,

09:58.800 --> 10:01.401
who I believe was just leaving.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.900
I was, but will asked me to stay a little longer

10:03.900 --> 10:06.734
and help out with all the newbies and stuff.

10:08.501 --> 10:11.034
Garbage detail.

10:11.034 --> 10:12.067
My idea.

10:14.134 --> 10:16.034
See ya.

10:18.067 --> 10:20.067
How could she have survived?

10:20.067 --> 10:21.467
And believe me,

10:21.467 --> 10:24.967
I say this wanting her
to be somewhere, anywhere,

10:24.967 --> 10:26.234
alive and well.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.034
Which could very well be the case.

10:30.900 --> 10:33.534
The first attacker teleported at 18:25 hours.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.234
Notice the change in
the em field's strength?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.933
The second attempted teleport

10:40.933 --> 10:42.933
happened less than three minutes later.

10:42.933 --> 10:44.200
Further destabilizing the field.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.467
Exactly.

10:46.467 --> 10:47.467
So you're saying

10:47.467 --> 10:49.467
the EM field was unstable when... 

10:49.467 --> 10:54.134
Ashley teleported at 18:29 hours.

10:56.867 --> 10:58.534
You think she got through?

10:58.534 --> 11:00.301
A further analysis needs to be done

11:00.301 --> 11:01.601
to determine exactly where

11:01.601 --> 11:04.134
she could have landed.

11:04.134 --> 11:06.301
I need you to be my emotional compass.

11:06.301 --> 11:08.800
We nearly lost the entire Sanctuary network

11:08.800 --> 11:10.434
because of my judgment.

11:10.434 --> 11:12.334
I need to know that
my instincts aren't wrong.

11:12.334 --> 11:13.967
That my feelings don't end up

11:13.967 --> 11:16.267
blinding my decisions.

11:40.034 --> 11:41.434
Heck, yeah.

12:02.634 --> 12:05.134
Come to mama.

12:09.634 --> 12:11.900
Oh!

12:11.900 --> 12:14.534
Okay, I'm going to gag.

12:25.567 --> 12:28.100
I'll be damned...

12:29.467 --> 12:31.534
love child of the dead.

12:31.534 --> 12:33.933
Shh...

12:33.933 --> 12:35.634
Hey...

12:35.634 --> 12:39.234
Come to mama...

12:39.234 --> 12:40.900
Ow!

12:40.900 --> 12:42.501
You little... 

12:43.668 --> 12:44.634
Oh... 

12:50.635 --> 12:51.635
Fabulous.

12:53.433 --> 12:54.834
If we move the kitapholus drocena here,

12:54.834 --> 12:56.334
we could put the seroslugs

12:56.334 --> 12:57.667
on the third floor by the lotus elks.

12:57.667 --> 12:59.901
No, lotus elk eat seroslug.

12:59.901 --> 13:02.034
What about the cryo-lab?

13:02.034 --> 13:03.368
Uh, that's the only room

13:03.368 --> 13:04.834
That goes to minus 30 degrees.

13:04.834 --> 13:06.567
I was hoping to save that
for the northern halcylops.

13:06.567 --> 13:09.268
Ah, what about the pradophili?

13:09.268 --> 13:10.301
Ooh, pradophili!

13:10.301 --> 13:11.368
Yeah, okay.

13:11.368 --> 13:12.934
Hey! ape man...

13:12.934 --> 13:14.600
and short human guy,

13:14.600 --> 13:15.834
I ordered thaI food, like, an hour ago.

13:15.834 --> 13:18.533
What, are you clowns on strike, or what?

13:18.533 --> 13:20.667
Look, annoying insect guy,

13:20.667 --> 13:22.268
you'll eat when it's your turn to eat.

13:22.268 --> 13:23.867
Oh, wait a minute.

13:23.867 --> 13:25.834
You hate me because
I got wings, don't you?

13:25.834 --> 13:27.734
Because I have the freedom of flight

13:27.734 --> 13:29.500
and you don't!

13:29.500 --> 13:31.101
Yeah, that's why I hate you.

13:31.101 --> 13:33.700
Now go back to your shoebox
and let us work, please.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.101
Ooh, uh, you going to eat that?

13:35.101 --> 13:38.433
Because I can make a serious
smorgasbord with that.

13:38.433 --> 13:39.867
Hey, listen,

13:39.867 --> 13:43.967
will you go away if I give it to you?

13:45.800 --> 13:48.400
Whoa, holy jeez!

13:48.400 --> 13:50.667
The density of these things.

13:50.667 --> 13:52.433
I can feel my deltoids.

13:52.433 --> 13:53.767
Oh...

13:53.767 --> 13:56.368
Hey, sweet cheeks, my room, now!

13:56.368 --> 13:57.433
You wish.

13:57.433 --> 13:58.467
Hey...

13:58.467 --> 14:00.533
what happened to you?

14:00.533 --> 14:02.634
Oh, yeah.

14:02.634 --> 14:05.067
Well, it seems like the dead female steno

14:05.067 --> 14:07.034
was still able to carry a healthy baby,

14:07.034 --> 14:08.834
and Mazel Tov,

14:08.834 --> 14:10.334
she had one.

14:10.334 --> 14:11.767
That's great!

14:11.767 --> 14:13.467
We should put it
in an incubator or something.

14:13.467 --> 14:14.533
Slight problem.

14:14.533 --> 14:16.433
It got away.

14:17.634 --> 14:18.834
Say again?

14:18.834 --> 14:20.533
Hey, I tried to stop it,

14:20.533 --> 14:22.934
But the little bugger tried to eat me.

14:22.934 --> 14:24.368
They were all in stasis.

14:24.368 --> 14:25.567
Mom was in stasis.

14:25.567 --> 14:27.700
Junior, as it turns out, not so much.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.467
This is not good. this is not good.

14:29.467 --> 14:30.600
We have to find it

14:30.600 --> 14:31.667
Before it gets eaten by something,

14:31.667 --> 14:34.034
Or vice versa.

14:36.901 --> 14:39.834
What were you doing down there?

14:39.834 --> 14:42.433
That is a very...

14:42.433 --> 14:44.101
astute question.

14:44.101 --> 14:47.600
Perhaps you'd like to sell me too?

14:49.600 --> 14:51.934
Maybe.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.967
How in the world?

15:02.967 --> 15:04.700
Oh, that's nasty food.

15:04.700 --> 15:06.134
No, no, no, no, no.

15:06.134 --> 15:08.700
Not good for you at all.

15:08.700 --> 15:09.634
Here, now.

15:09.634 --> 15:11.533
Here, just let me... 

15:20.750 --> 15:21.984
I know that look.

15:21.984 --> 15:23.950
Just spill it.

15:23.950 --> 15:26.984
What do you think happens after we die?

15:26.984 --> 15:29.251
You've seen more lives end

15:29.251 --> 15:31.817
than anyone else that I know.

15:31.817 --> 15:32.950
Kurt and Albert and I

15:32.950 --> 15:34.284
got into this discussion once

15:34.284 --> 15:35.683
at a Princeton football game.

15:35.683 --> 15:36.817
I think it was 1953.

15:36.817 --> 15:38.217
Albert argued

15:38.217 --> 15:39.750
that the concept of
matter equaling energy,

15:39.750 --> 15:41.151
And vice versa,

15:41.151 --> 15:42.351
was far more ubiquitous

15:42.351 --> 15:43.817
than any of us could have imagined.

15:43.817 --> 15:45.084
That would be

15:45.084 --> 15:47.750
Kurt Godel and Albert Einstein?

15:47.750 --> 15:49.351
Of course.

15:49.351 --> 15:51.750
Look, I'm a guy
hammering in stakes here.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.017
You want to have

15:53.017 --> 15:55.217
a little mercy?

15:55.217 --> 15:56.583
What do I think death is?

15:56.583 --> 15:57.984
Yeah.

15:57.984 --> 15:59.850
Did you ever see "field of dreams"?

15:59.850 --> 16:02.184
Yeah, I loved that movie.

16:02.184 --> 16:03.817
The cornfield.

16:03.817 --> 16:05.984
It's rather like that.

16:05.984 --> 16:07.117
I never understood

16:07.117 --> 16:08.251
what happened in the cornfield.

16:08.251 --> 16:09.984
Nobody did. That was the point.

16:13.784 --> 16:15.117
Helen...

16:15.117 --> 16:18.251
you're missing out on all the fun.

16:18.251 --> 16:19.351
There's food if you're hungry.

16:19.351 --> 16:21.884
Dr. Li can patch you up if you're injured.

16:21.884 --> 16:23.917
I haven't the time.

16:23.917 --> 16:26.683
I wonder why.

16:26.683 --> 16:28.017
You'll be pleased to know

16:28.017 --> 16:29.683
Nikola and I are making significant headway

16:29.683 --> 16:30.917
into the cabal's operations.

16:30.917 --> 16:33.284
Individual cells exist,

16:33.284 --> 16:36.717
but the central brain trust has...

16:36.717 --> 16:38.750
been undone.

16:38.750 --> 16:40.184
You're killing them off.

16:42.017 --> 16:45.151
Well, they exist only as disparate,

16:45.151 --> 16:46.917
disconnected camps now.

16:49.850 --> 16:51.051
And dana whitcomb?

16:51.051 --> 16:53.418
A fugitive,

16:53.418 --> 16:54.717
but it's only a matter of time.

16:55.884 --> 16:57.750
She will answer for what she's done.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.850
With her life? Will that help?

16:59.850 --> 17:01.117
Oh...

17:01.117 --> 17:03.351
On second thought, don't answer that.

17:03.351 --> 17:05.217
Perhaps once I've found her,

17:05.217 --> 17:09.284
I'll simply hand her over to the authorities?

17:09.284 --> 17:10.983
I don't need your blessing!

17:12.817 --> 17:14.317
And there is a part of you

17:14.317 --> 17:21.050
that's dying for the moment
I come and tell you it's done.

17:21.050 --> 17:23.916
I'm choosing to focus on other things, John,

17:23.916 --> 17:25.317
like rebuilding.

17:25.317 --> 17:28.084
Then plan Ashley's funeral.

17:28.084 --> 17:30.950
Not yet. Not until I say.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.317
In this delusional little game you're playing... 

17:32.317 --> 17:33.384
There is a chance... 

17:33.384 --> 17:34.451
Is there really?

17:34.451 --> 17:36.418
Yes!

17:36.418 --> 17:40.217
You may have been able
to convince these others

17:40.217 --> 17:43.984
to follow you down this perverse rabbit hole,

17:43.984 --> 17:46.384
but I will not!

17:46.384 --> 17:48.217
They took her from us

17:48.217 --> 17:49.917
in the most unnatural way

17:49.917 --> 17:52.351
Possible!

17:57.451 --> 18:00.117
I'm doing my part.

18:02.917 --> 18:04.384
Do yours.

18:41.017 --> 18:44.050
Gas station's five miles back.

18:44.050 --> 18:45.217
Actually,

18:45.217 --> 18:47.951
I... I'm trying to find tehuatonichen.

18:47.951 --> 18:49.951
My information says it's in this area.

18:49.951 --> 18:52.150
Am I close?

18:52.150 --> 18:54.784
Ain't nothin' round here but desert.

19:03.751 --> 19:06.984
We'll track the steno, and we'll bag it with snares,

19:06.984 --> 19:08.784
or if we have to, we'll use a shock web.

19:08.784 --> 19:10.284
No, definitely not,

19:10.284 --> 19:11.984
and please, gently with the snares.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.183
We don't want to hurt it.

19:13.183 --> 19:15.183
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Dude...

19:15.183 --> 19:18.384
Snares? It's a steno.

19:18.384 --> 19:21.350
I say you set the phasers to 11

19:21.350 --> 19:23.918
and fry the sucker. Hmm?

19:23.918 --> 19:25.350
It was defending itself,

19:25.350 --> 19:27.117
most likely from being sold on the black market

19:27.117 --> 19:28.217
by you.

19:31.751 --> 19:33.884
We need some bait.

19:33.884 --> 19:35.817
We were feeding its parents

19:35.817 --> 19:37.784
bamboo leaves and shoots... 

19:37.784 --> 19:39.150
or my day-old hamburger...

19:39.150 --> 19:40.984
Shush.

19:40.984 --> 19:43.117
As I was saying,

19:43.117 --> 19:45.250
we have several rare genera of bamboo

19:45.250 --> 19:46.651
from the southern Yangtze region

19:46.651 --> 19:49.050
which I'm sure it will find very delicious.

19:49.050 --> 19:50.350
Let's just get this thing back in a cage

19:50.350 --> 19:51.651
before it gets eaten by something hungrier

19:51.651 --> 19:52.784
and bigger.

19:52.784 --> 19:54.384
I'm telling you, burgers!

19:54.384 --> 19:56.050
Thanks for the tip.

19:57.284 --> 20:00.918
And the whole the snare thing, big mistake!

20:00.918 --> 20:04.117
I can't see anything here.

20:05.651 --> 20:07.183
There's no evidence in the bio-scanner

20:07.183 --> 20:09.183
of Ashley escaping the EM field perimeter.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.050
I've been looking at this from the wrong point of view.

20:13.050 --> 20:14.317
I thought

20:14.317 --> 20:15.751
the de-stabilization in the field meant

20:15.751 --> 20:17.018
that she might've gotten through it.

20:17.018 --> 20:18.217
What else could it mean?

20:18.217 --> 20:20.018
Well, that she simply bounced back

20:20.018 --> 20:21.417
within the field itself,

20:21.417 --> 20:22.851
re-materialized somewhere inside the sanctuary.

20:22.851 --> 20:24.918
Think about it, Will.

20:24.918 --> 20:26.851
Why did the field weaken

20:26.851 --> 20:29.384
at the exact moment that she teleported?

20:29.384 --> 20:31.284
An anomaly?

20:31.284 --> 20:32.717
A power surge because she was taking

20:32.717 --> 20:34.018
one of the super abnormals with her at the time?

20:34.018 --> 20:35.018
You're reaching.

20:35.018 --> 20:36.417
All we need to do

20:36.417 --> 20:37.651
is search for elements of Ashley's DNA

20:37.651 --> 20:38.751
inside the Sanctuary.

20:38.751 --> 20:41.217
No, no, no, you're reaching.

20:41.217 --> 20:43.350
We have had a work crew in the Sanctuary

20:43.350 --> 20:44.484
for a week,

20:44.484 --> 20:46.018
and no one has found anything

20:46.018 --> 20:47.817
that could be possibly be construed as a body.

20:47.817 --> 20:48.984
But they haven't been everywhere.

20:53.450 --> 20:56.717
She could be disoriented...

20:56.717 --> 20:58.083
Or hurt.

20:59.183 --> 21:00.284
Or gone.

21:04.884 --> 21:06.984
Do you really want me to stop?

21:16.350 --> 21:19.317
Ground floor, lower level secured.

21:19.317 --> 21:20.951
Okay, good.

21:20.951 --> 21:22.150
Dr. li?

21:22.150 --> 21:23.350
No sign yet.

21:25.384 --> 21:26.450
Perhaps it's sleeping somewhere.

21:26.450 --> 21:28.951
They only sleep at night.

21:28.951 --> 21:30.884
It will definitely be awake.

21:30.884 --> 21:32.784
Everybody stay in touch.

21:42.083 --> 21:43.117
Wait, wait, wait.

21:43.117 --> 21:45.450
I have him.

21:45.450 --> 21:48.183
Can you get it?

21:52.284 --> 21:54.150
All right.

21:54.150 --> 21:56.417
All right...

22:07.183 --> 22:10.384
On the move, going for the lower levels.

22:10.384 --> 22:12.884
Hey, big guy, it's headed your way!

22:12.884 --> 22:14.450
Ready.

22:22.284 --> 22:23.417
Got you, you little... 

22:26.484 --> 22:28.784
Oh...

22:32.918 --> 22:34.250
Hey, what happened?

22:34.250 --> 22:36.217
Oh, it jumped.

22:36.217 --> 22:37.484
It can't jump. Stenos don't do that.

22:37.484 --> 22:38.551
This one did.

22:38.551 --> 22:40.951
Oh, damn it.

22:40.951 --> 22:42.217
It's in the vent system.

22:42.217 --> 22:43.984
Can't you just trap it in there?

22:43.984 --> 22:46.117
Not fast enough. This is very bad.

22:49.384 --> 22:52.117
Oh, great.

22:52.117 --> 22:53.417
It's gone.

22:55.418 --> 22:57.418
Well, you clearly don't need my help.

23:11.701 --> 23:14.868
This is a disaster.

23:14.868 --> 23:17.701
The titanic's a disaster.

23:17.701 --> 23:19.267
Madonna's movie career, disaster.

23:19.267 --> 23:20.601
This is nothing.

23:20.601 --> 23:21.667
You don't get it, do you?

23:22.767 --> 23:24.434
I'm supposed to be the man,

23:24.434 --> 23:25.767
and losing a one-of-a-kind baby steno

23:25.767 --> 23:27.501
does not exactly make me "the man".

23:27.501 --> 23:29.601
Quite a predicament.

23:29.601 --> 23:30.901
If only you had the services

23:30.901 --> 23:32.634
of a world-class hunter/tracker

23:32.634 --> 23:33.968
at your disposal.

23:33.968 --> 23:35.234
Name your price.

23:35.234 --> 23:38.801
Never say that to me unless you mean it.

23:38.801 --> 23:40.300
I'm saying it.

23:41.934 --> 23:43.634
Mommy and daddy's tusks.

23:43.634 --> 23:45.701
No. No. No way.

23:45.701 --> 23:49.868
The bamboo salesman
and the giant walking rug

23:49.868 --> 23:51.567
are running the Sanctuary,

23:51.567 --> 23:53.033
and I'm right here,

23:53.033 --> 23:56.868
healthy, willing and able.

23:57.968 --> 23:59.334
Come on, Henry,

23:59.334 --> 24:02.434
do you want to be the man or not?

24:02.434 --> 24:04.067
One steno tusk. one.

24:04.067 --> 24:05.767
Two sets of two, or it's not worth it.

24:05.767 --> 24:07.067
One set... 

24:07.067 --> 24:07.934
the female.

24:07.934 --> 24:08.834
Fine.

24:10.601 --> 24:12.467
Let's roll!

24:12.467 --> 24:14.100
Once the scan is complete,

24:14.100 --> 24:16.501
any biological artifacts matching Ashley's DNA

24:16.501 --> 24:17.701
should show up.

24:17.701 --> 24:19.067
If we do find something,

24:19.067 --> 24:20.601
how do we know

24:20.601 --> 24:22.100
that it's not from one of the super abnormals

24:22.100 --> 24:23.467
that attacked us?

24:23.467 --> 24:24.801
Didn't they share Ashley's DNA?

24:24.801 --> 24:25.968
I'm hopeful

24:25.968 --> 24:27.100
that there are ways to tell the difference.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.334
Either way,

24:28.334 --> 24:29.434
we should have a good idea
of what really happened.

24:32.868 --> 24:33.968
I can't tell if this is a real investigation

24:33.968 --> 24:34.968
or a train wreck.

24:36.501 --> 24:38.501
Oh, look, I... I'm sorry, I didn't... 

24:38.501 --> 24:39.601
No, no.

24:39.601 --> 24:40.934
Never stop doing that,

24:40.934 --> 24:42.734
being honest with me.

24:42.734 --> 24:44.534
anything else, and I  will be insulted.

24:48.033 --> 24:49.534
Thanks.

24:49.534 --> 24:52.067
Sancho Panza had it easy.

24:52.067 --> 24:54.934
Ashley and I always had to face tragedy and loss

24:54.934 --> 24:56.667
in our work.

24:56.667 --> 24:57.767
I taught her a saying... 

24:57.767 --> 25:01.067
"nos must amitto vivo en."

25:01.067 --> 25:02.534
"We must let go to live on."

25:03.701 --> 25:04.801
Well done, Sancho.

25:04.801 --> 25:07.467
You know, she always faced death

25:07.467 --> 25:09.000
better than me,

25:09.000 --> 25:10.734
among many things.

25:10.734 --> 25:11.767
That must've been hard,

25:11.767 --> 25:14.067
just you and her.

25:15.767 --> 25:18.868
It was worth every minute.

25:21.501 --> 25:24.501
There has been an incident

25:24.501 --> 25:27.701
at Vera's burger shack on Salisbury.

25:27.701 --> 25:30.934
Just let me handle the cops, okay?

25:30.934 --> 25:31.934
Can I help you folks?

25:31.934 --> 25:33.234
Health department.

25:33.234 --> 25:35.367
We got a call about a code violation.

25:35.367 --> 25:38.667
Okay, go ahead.

25:38.667 --> 25:39.734
Health department?

25:39.734 --> 25:41.334
No one ever checks.

25:41.334 --> 25:42.767
So, what did I tell you?

25:42.767 --> 25:44.434
Burgers.

25:44.434 --> 25:46.267
Okay, shush.

25:46.267 --> 25:47.501
It happened only 20 minutes ago.

25:47.501 --> 25:49.534
It couldn't have gotten far.

25:49.534 --> 25:50.934
Especially if it just ate.

25:55.434 --> 25:56.934
Is it just me,

25:56.934 --> 25:58.400
or has its shoe size gone up?

25:58.400 --> 26:01.434
We're going to need a bigger cage.

26:05.868 --> 26:07.000
Just chowed down,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.067
been on the run for a while.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.067
If I was a full, tired critter,

26:11.067 --> 26:13.701
I'd want a place to lay low for a bit.

26:13.701 --> 26:14.868
Make a nest.

26:14.868 --> 26:15.934
I'm thinkin' yeah.

26:15.934 --> 26:17.968
Yeah.

26:23.801 --> 26:26.868
Made it myself.

26:26.868 --> 26:28.467
I'm not hungry, thank you.

26:31.767 --> 26:34.100
Okay.

26:36.434 --> 26:38.334
Will, would you please stop hovering?

26:38.334 --> 26:39.400
I can take care of myself.

26:40.734 --> 26:43.767
You've barely eaten for six days.

26:43.767 --> 26:44.934
You've had hardly any sleep.

26:44.934 --> 26:46.501
Even for you, this is extreme.

26:46.501 --> 26:47.767
I'm fine.

26:47.767 --> 26:49.667
Yes and no.

26:49.667 --> 26:50.734
You've got a clear mind,

26:50.734 --> 26:51.968
good focus,

26:51.968 --> 26:54.434
but you also, you know...

26:56.567 --> 26:59.567
you drift off now and again. You leave.

26:59.567 --> 27:01.434
It's just memories.

27:02.834 --> 27:04.334
If this bio-scan comes up empty... 

27:04.334 --> 27:06.734
What theory will I cook up next to keep this quest alive?

27:06.734 --> 27:08.534
No, I wasn't saying that.

27:08.534 --> 27:10.501
Yes, you were.

27:11.868 --> 27:13.033
I need to know,

27:13.033 --> 27:16.434
are you searching for closure...

27:16.434 --> 27:17.601
or a miracle?

27:17.601 --> 27:20.367
There are no such thing as miracles.

27:23.033 --> 27:25.534
It's found something.

27:27.934 --> 27:29.400
Okay, the coordinates say

27:29.400 --> 27:33.067
it should be right...

27:33.067 --> 27:35.601
there.

27:35.602 --> 27:36.602
Oh, my God.

27:47.501 --> 27:50.800
Once you get it free, bring it to the lab.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.367
I'll run a full autopsy.

27:53.367 --> 27:55.201
I'll meet you there.

27:59.134 --> 28:00.468
Big guy, if you want me to do this... 

28:00.468 --> 28:02.867
No.

28:09.167 --> 28:10.301
Oh!

28:10.301 --> 28:11.301
Wow.

28:11.301 --> 28:13.600
Okay. Okay, I draw the line.

28:13.600 --> 28:14.800
Come on.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.234
Big kudos to the consultant.

28:16.234 --> 28:17.633
You were right about it
trying to find a place

28:17.633 --> 28:19.633
to lay low.

28:19.633 --> 28:21.301
That's a sewer down there.

28:21.301 --> 28:23.167
Yeah.

28:23.167 --> 28:24.568
City worker gets attacked in the sewer.

28:24.568 --> 28:26.468
We go into the sewers.

28:26.468 --> 28:27.568
And the stink

28:27.568 --> 28:29.201
that never comes out of your clothes?

28:29.201 --> 28:30.367
Are we ignoring the need

28:30.367 --> 28:32.101
for new wardrobe?

28:32.101 --> 28:34.501
Get in the hole.

28:34.501 --> 28:37.201
Okay, but not with this.

28:37.201 --> 28:38.667
No, no, come on.

28:38.667 --> 28:40.700
Get with the program, please.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.934
Hank, reality check.

28:42.934 --> 28:44.767
This thing just sent a fry cook

28:44.767 --> 28:45.800
and a sewer worker

28:45.800 --> 28:48.234
to the emergency room

28:48.234 --> 28:49.600
with lacerations.

28:49.600 --> 28:52.501
It's obviously way nastier

28:52.501 --> 28:54.234
than it was this morning.

28:54.234 --> 28:58.568
You want the tusks or not?

28:58.568 --> 29:00.334
Anything?

29:00.334 --> 29:01.568
The remains are too burnt

29:01.568 --> 29:02.700
to determine a fingerprint pattern.

29:02.700 --> 29:03.800
What about you?

29:03.800 --> 29:05.434
X-rays we were able to recover.

29:05.434 --> 29:07.568
Tissue analysis and bone density results

29:07.568 --> 29:09.501
will take a little more time.

29:09.501 --> 29:11.633
This isn't Ashley.

29:11.633 --> 29:13.867
How can you tell?

29:13.867 --> 29:15.834
Ashley broke her right femur
when she was 12 years old.

29:15.834 --> 29:18.867
This one shows no evidence of re-calcification.

29:18.867 --> 29:20.468
These are the remains

29:20.468 --> 29:21.700
of one of the other super abnormals

29:25.633 --> 29:27.301
Okay, well, it's something.

29:28.468 --> 29:29.767
Look, I... I know you were hoping

29:29.767 --> 29:32.267
for something else, but... 

29:32.267 --> 29:33.234
Hey...

29:35.633 --> 29:37.568
I'm feeling quite tired, Will.

29:37.568 --> 29:40.334
I think I'll lie down for a while.

29:56.534 --> 29:59.633
These fries look almost fresh.

29:59.633 --> 30:01.434
It's got to be close.

30:01.434 --> 30:02.834
Once we do bag it,

30:02.834 --> 30:05.733
breaking it from its junk food habit

30:05.733 --> 30:07.934
is going to be a bitch.

30:07.934 --> 30:09.334
All right, these tunnels rejoin

30:09.334 --> 30:10.568
a couple blocks south of here,

30:10.568 --> 30:11.667
so you take left, Ill go right.

30:11.667 --> 30:12.733
We'll flush it out into the open

30:12.733 --> 30:13.900
On the other side.

30:13.900 --> 30:15.468
Sounds like a plan.

30:15.468 --> 30:16.834
Keep in touch, and remember... 

30:16.834 --> 30:18.767
Stun. No gun. I got it.

30:18.767 --> 30:21.234
Yeah. Great.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.900
Policy-schmolicy.

30:59.534 --> 31:00.633
Hello.

31:00.633 --> 31:03.568
What are you looking for?

31:03.568 --> 31:05.767
A place that doesn't exist, apparently.

31:05.767 --> 31:07.334
Tehuatonichen.

31:07.334 --> 31:09.067
Yes.

31:09.067 --> 31:11.334
You're right. It doesn't exist.

31:11.334 --> 31:14.733
And yet you've heard of it.

31:20.568 --> 31:22.834
Einstein was right.

31:22.834 --> 31:24.468
Matter into energy.

31:24.468 --> 31:26.434
Right, but landing where?

31:26.434 --> 31:27.600
The em field itself.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.468
That's what the fluctuation means.

31:28.468 --> 31:29.468
That's why I keep seeing...

31:32.667 --> 31:34.034
the magnitude and amplitude of the field increased

31:34.034 --> 31:35.367
at the time of her jump.

31:35.367 --> 31:37.633
EM fields absorb energy.

31:37.633 --> 31:39.934
She could be somewhere in the em field's buffer,

31:39.934 --> 31:41.334
trapped mid-teleport.

31:41.334 --> 31:42.434
In the computer?

31:42.434 --> 31:43.834
Exactly.

31:43.834 --> 31:45.367
That's insane.

31:45.367 --> 31:47.967
Ashley teleported with another super abnormal.

31:47.967 --> 31:50.767
The fluctuation could be the em field's buffer

31:50.767 --> 31:52.568
capturing both signatures and storing them... 

31:52.568 --> 31:53.633
Okay.

31:53.633 --> 31:55.067
Okay, even if she is

31:55.067 --> 31:57.401
in here, somehow, what are you going to do?

31:57.401 --> 31:58.800
You're going try to communicate with her?

31:58.800 --> 32:00.334
You going to try to pull her out somehow?

32:00.334 --> 32:02.568
If we could recreate her signature effectively,

32:02.568 --> 32:03.867
there may be a way to... to...

32:03.867 --> 32:05.267
To what?

32:05.267 --> 32:07.800
There are so many variables to consider, Will,

32:07.800 --> 32:08.834
so many pieces to this puzzle.

32:08.834 --> 32:09.834
Oh, Magnus...

32:09.834 --> 32:10.934
one more test.

32:10.934 --> 32:13.633
I run an exponential wave analysis.

32:13.633 --> 32:15.468
I search the EM field for her particular... 

32:15.468 --> 32:16.501
Magnus!

32:31.934 --> 32:34.000
Okay.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.034
Okay.

32:39.967 --> 32:41.034
What next?

33:09.834 --> 33:13.134
Come on, Junior...

33:39.534 --> 33:41.200
Easy, now...

33:41.200 --> 33:42.434
Let's take this nice and slow.

33:47.034 --> 33:49.668
Do you want a piece of me, boy?

33:49.668 --> 33:52.267
Huh?

33:52.267 --> 33:53.401
Do you?

33:53.401 --> 33:55.601
You're a boy, right?

34:18.000 --> 34:19.601
So, it's bigger.

34:19.601 --> 34:21.400
Yeah, and bulletproof!

34:22.301 --> 34:23.967
Move! move, move!

34:25.333 --> 34:26.501
I thought you said no guns!

34:26.501 --> 34:28.000
I said no guns for you.

34:29.100 --> 34:30.501
Oof!

34:30.501 --> 34:32.400
Ow.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.900
Get off of me.

34:37.933 --> 34:38.900
Where the hell are we?

34:38.900 --> 34:40.333
Uh, I don't know.

34:42.167 --> 34:43.100
Looks like your room.

34:43.100 --> 34:44.567
Hey...

34:45.668 --> 34:48.266
these are my jeans.

34:48.266 --> 34:49.900
Oh, man.

34:49.900 --> 34:51.199
What?

34:51.199 --> 34:53.234
I think we found its nest.

34:55.199 --> 34:56.501
Okay, we got to get out of here.

34:59.634 --> 35:01.200
Why didn't it kill you

35:01.200 --> 35:02.334
in the tunnel back there?

35:04.601 --> 35:05.967
Henry, it's coming!

35:05.967 --> 35:07.367
Yeah, I know! just hold on a sec!

35:07.367 --> 35:09.601
I'm going to empty a mag into it!

35:09.601 --> 35:10.933
No, you are not!

35:10.933 --> 35:11.967
Oh, yeah, I am!

35:11.967 --> 35:15.267
Food, water, shelter...

35:15.267 --> 35:16.434
Oh, Kate, wait!

35:18.534 --> 35:19.601
Henry!

35:19.601 --> 35:21.601
No, no, no!

35:22.567 --> 35:23.668
Ow!

35:32.967 --> 35:34.100
What the hell?

35:35.601 --> 35:36.701
Look around you.

35:36.701 --> 35:38.401
What's the first thing it did?

35:38.401 --> 35:41.100
It licked your face, ate your food,

35:41.100 --> 35:42.501
stole your clothes.

35:42.501 --> 35:44.134
You were the first thing it saw.

35:44.134 --> 35:46.200
It thinks you're its mother.

35:48.100 --> 35:50.267
I think it has your eyes.

35:53.501 --> 35:55.967
Get off.

36:04.401 --> 36:07.000
I came to return this to you.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.734
It was given to me in the Amazon.

36:14.401 --> 36:17.768
He was Sani,

36:17.768 --> 36:20.768
our last living shaman,

36:20.768 --> 36:23.034
spirit leader of our tribe.

36:23.034 --> 36:26.000
I was asked to bring him home.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.401
For 300 years

36:29.401 --> 36:33.668
we've been waiting for his return.

36:33.668 --> 36:36.167
This means

36:36.167 --> 36:38.367
my ancestors will be at peace.

36:45.367 --> 36:47.634
We want you to have this.

36:50.334 --> 36:52.267
It was meant for you.

36:53.800 --> 36:56.668
May it guide you through dark places

36:56.668 --> 36:58.334
and into the light.

37:13.534 --> 37:15.067
You should see this.

37:30.768 --> 37:34.067
I'm truly sorry, Magnus.

37:34.067 --> 37:35.301
Tell everyone

37:35.301 --> 37:36.734
the memorial service will be tomorrow.

37:38.668 --> 37:41.434
I need to reset the EM field.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.833
There's your rare baby, Dr. Li,

37:51.833 --> 37:54.601
intact and everything.

37:54.601 --> 37:56.401
You've traumatized it.

37:56.401 --> 37:58.634
It keeps showing its teeth.

37:58.634 --> 38:00.668
To you, not to me.

38:00.668 --> 38:02.134
You're just jealous

38:02.134 --> 38:04.668
because Ralphie chose me for its mother.

38:04.668 --> 38:06.167
You don't even know what gender it is.

38:06.167 --> 38:07.867
Does it really matter?

38:15.367 --> 38:18.401
Ral-fee...

38:18.401 --> 38:20.401
It's got a... a ring to it.

38:20.401 --> 38:22.367
Ow!

38:24.768 --> 38:25.800
You're growing on him.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.301
Feels good, doesn't it?

38:33.301 --> 38:35.367
Being a good guy?

38:35.367 --> 38:36.367
Meh.

38:36.367 --> 38:37.501
I got to admit,

38:37.501 --> 38:39.734
you're pretty good at this.

38:39.734 --> 38:40.900
Back at ya, hank.

38:42.301 --> 38:43.467
So...

38:43.467 --> 38:44.833
you going to stick around?

38:44.833 --> 38:47.567
Well, I got to get paid, don't I?

38:47.567 --> 38:49.534
Right.

38:49.534 --> 38:52.334
Well, a deal's a deal.

38:52.334 --> 38:53.534
One steno set.

38:53.534 --> 38:55.567
Have fun in Maui.

39:02.334 --> 39:05.301
Tell you what,

39:05.301 --> 39:06.301
hang onto them for me.

39:06.301 --> 39:08.167
I'll collect them later.

39:14.634 --> 39:16.267
See you, baby.

39:28.501 --> 39:32.967
I see you've come to your senses.

39:32.967 --> 39:36.234
Interesting turn of phrase.

39:36.234 --> 39:39.567
All my senses tell me that she's still alive,

39:39.567 --> 39:40.634
somewhere... 

39:40.634 --> 39:41.634
Stop.

39:41.634 --> 39:44.634
Please.

39:48.501 --> 39:50.534
In the end, what she chose to do

39:50.534 --> 39:51.701
she did as Ashley,

39:51.701 --> 39:53.467
not what they turned her into.

39:53.467 --> 39:55.467
Yes.

39:55.467 --> 40:00.701
Please take some solace in that.

40:00.701 --> 40:02.301
I think not.

40:02.301 --> 40:04.933
Are you joining us?

40:04.933 --> 40:08.000
You may have found closure.

40:09.900 --> 40:11.401
I haven't.

40:13.634 --> 40:14.967
Not yet.

40:14.967 --> 40:16.867
John...

42:14.800 --> 42:19.000
Nos must amitto vivo en.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.668
We must let go.

42:23.601 --> 42:25.933
I can't.

42:25.933 --> 42:28.734
You have to, mom.

42:28.734 --> 42:32.768
But you're...

42:32.768 --> 42:34.267
You're my life.

42:35.601 --> 42:37.434
Without you... 

42:37.434 --> 42:40.933
You'll never be without me,

42:40.933 --> 42:43.367
and I know that you will always love me.

42:46.334 --> 42:48.900
No matter what.

42:52.768 --> 42:54.534
Ashley!

42:58.534 --> 43:01.900
Please...

43:01.900 --> 43:06.900
I'm so sorry.
