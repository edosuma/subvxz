HAVE GONE SO WRONG?

19:23.295 --> 19:24.663
WANDA WAS RIGHT!

19:24.730 --> 19:26.798
I SHOULD HAVE READ MORE
THAN THE FIRST CHAPTER.

19:26.865 --> 19:29.868
{\an1}WAIT! THAT'S IT, I CAN
SKIP TO THE LAST CHAPTER

19:29.935 --> 19:31.537

HOW TO GET OUT OF THIS.

DEFEAT THE BIG BRAIN

19:52.024 --> 19:53.692

19:53.759 --> 19:55.260
I DON'T HAVE
A ROCKET SHIP

DOING THIS? WHY?

20:55.854 --> 20:58.490
{\an1}LOOK AT ME!
I'M A GIANT BRAIN.

20:58.557 --> 21:00.492
{\an1}WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE TO
DO ALL DAY

21:00.559 --> 21:02.361
{\an1}EXCEPT TAKE OVER

HEY, CROCKER!

21:33.125 --> 21:35.260
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
ALL THESE ROBOTS?

21:35.327 --> 21:37.529
WELL, THAT'S JUST
A PLAIN SILLY THING TO ASK.

21:37.596 --> 21:40.198
