We really need to get

00:37.538 --> 00:40.501
'cause if we do,
we'll get invited
to the Vuuugle studio.

00:40.501 --> 00:45.716
(heavenly choir type singing)

00:45.716 --> 00:48.469
It's this killer space
we've been dying to get into

00:48.469 --> 00:50.511
where all the biggest
Internet stars shoot
their videos.

00:50.511 --> 00:53.384
Yeah, they've got
hi-tech gear, and sets,

00:53.384 --> 00:55.976
and a wardrobe department,
and makeup, and clothes,

00:55.976 --> 00:58.018
which is the same as wardrobe,
which I already said, and--

01:02.483 --> 01:04.394

we had a big dilemma.

01:04.394 --> 01:07.027
We had a science project due
about endangered species,

01:07.027 --> 01:08.779
but we also needed to make
a new video for you guys.

01:08.779 --> 01:11.192
So, we killed two birds
with one stone.

01:11.192 --> 01:15.116
No actual birds were harmed
in the making of this video.

01:15.116 --> 01:18.329

that doesn't get a lot of love.

01:18.329 --> 01:19.910
No love!

01:19.910 --> 01:21.752
Probably because he was voted

Do you really want to fit in
at this stuffy prep school?

02:37.698 --> 02:40.911

we conjugated verbs.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.583

02:42.583 --> 02:45.045

I was just asking
the guy at the copy place.

05:43.514 --> 05:46.847
Bernie, to be an agent,
you kind of have to
have clients.

So what I'm hearing you say
is you'll let me

05:49.390 --> 05:51.972

if I can sign one client?

05:51.972 --> 05:54.274
Oh yeah. Sure, Bernie.
We'll be your clients

09:56.266 --> 09:58.308
It's a big deal.

10:00.310 --> 10:01.561
He's mean.

10:01.561 --> 10:02.683
I like him.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.986
Frankie, this party
is our chance

10:05.986 --> 10:07.898
to make everybody here
not hate us!

10:07.898 --> 10:10.861
We can't re-bake Dirk's cake
or get Amelia's video back,

10:10.861 --> 10:12.442
but we can make people laugh.

10:12.442 --> 10:13.824
You're right.

10:13.824 --> 10:16.236
We should make that video
we were talking about at school.

10:16.236 --> 10:18.618
The Comeback Song!
 That's perfect!

10:18.618 --> 10:20.040
-Let's go write it.
-Wait.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.581
There's something
really important

10:21.581 --> 10:22.622
we need to do first.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.124
Frankie:
Whoo! Woo-hoo!

10:24.124 --> 10:25.916
Whoo!

10:27.748 --> 10:29.589
All right. Let's get to work.

10:37.968 --> 10:40.020
Hey, what's up, little man?

10:40.020 --> 10:42.472
The nurse says
I'm average for my--

10:42.472 --> 10:43.764
Doesn't matter.

10:43.764 --> 10:44.935
Bernie Schotz.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.186
Talent agent.

10:46.186 --> 10:47.978
I'd like to represent you.

10:47.978 --> 10:50.530
"Bernie's sincere.
He'll protect your career.

10:50.530 --> 10:53.273
Ugh. These rhymes are awful
and people hate me."

10:53.273 --> 10:54.574
Again?

10:54.574 --> 10:58.198
I swear that copy guy
is doing it on purpose.

10:58.198 --> 11:01.121
Look, if you make
me your agent,

11:01.121 --> 11:02.452
I will hustle for you.

11:02.452 --> 11:07.247
I'm talkin' TV shows,
movies, your own record label!

11:07.247 --> 11:08.498
Eh.

11:08.498 --> 11:10.130
What about your face
on a mug?

11:10.130 --> 11:11.291
I'm listening.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.795
Great! I'll talk
to my mug people.

11:14.795 --> 11:15.886
Hang on!

11:15.886 --> 11:17.718
Anyone who joins my team

11:17.718 --> 11:19.559
has to be on board
with me creatively.

11:19.559 --> 11:20.721
No problem.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.893
Bernie Schotz can handle
anything you throw at him.

11:22.893 --> 11:25.726
All right, DareHeads,
my new dare assistant here

11:25.726 --> 11:28.478
is gonna butt heads
with this wild ram.

11:28.478 --> 11:30.941
Wait, what are we doing?

11:30.941 --> 11:32.773
(ram grunts)

11:32.773 --> 11:34.364
(grunting, clanking)

11:34.364 --> 11:36.076
Oh! Here we go!

11:36.076 --> 11:37.317
I don't think
I wanna do this.

11:37.317 --> 11:39.910
Too late. Already clapped
and said, "Here we go!"

11:39.910 --> 11:41.241
Now let me just
rattle his crate

11:41.241 --> 11:42.622
and get him extra angry.

11:44.374 --> 11:46.036
-(crashing)
-(gasps)

11:46.036 --> 11:48.168
He did not need that, did he?

11:48.168 --> 11:49.709
Ready, Bern?

11:50.710 --> 11:53.093
-Bern?
-(screaming)

11:54.634 --> 11:56.256
I bought a ram for this!

11:56.256 --> 11:57.547
Come on!

11:57.547 --> 11:58.969
(ram roars)

12:02.843 --> 12:04.975
Thanks for unlocking
the studio for us, Liam.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.436
Oh, yes, of course.

12:06.436 --> 12:08.268
Yes, I got a degree
from Oxford

12:08.268 --> 12:10.941
so I can open doors
for tweenagers.

12:14.064 --> 12:15.735
"Bizaardvark."

12:15.735 --> 12:17.027
Okay, I'll bite.

12:17.027 --> 12:18.618
How'd you come up
with that name?

12:18.618 --> 12:21.661
It was a very long
and complicated process.

12:21.661 --> 12:23.703
Okay, we need a name
for our channel.

12:23.703 --> 12:25.415
Let's just go
through the alphabet.

12:25.415 --> 12:27.747
-"A," aardvark.
-"B," bizarre.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.870
(both gasp)
Bizaardvark!

12:31.792 --> 12:33.834
I don't get it.

12:33.834 --> 12:36.136
It's just silly.
We make comedy videos.

12:36.136 --> 12:38.138
Like right now,
we're making one
for the VidView party.

12:38.138 --> 12:42.052
It's called
 We're Really Good at Comebacks,
Just Not Right Away.

12:42.052 --> 12:45.685
But-- but that would mean
that you're not really good
at comebacks.

12:45.685 --> 12:47.147
Right. That's the joke.

12:47.147 --> 12:48.598
(chuckles awkwardly)

12:48.598 --> 12:49.729
I don't get it.

12:55.105 --> 12:56.446
I don't get it.

12:56.446 --> 12:58.778
I meant,
"Did you want a slice?"

12:58.778 --> 13:00.360
That was for my birthday.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.781
What is wrong with you?

13:01.781 --> 13:03.363
You just deleted my video!

13:03.363 --> 13:05.115
I don't get it.

13:05.115 --> 13:06.746
Well, you can't please everyone.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.410
We need to change
our video for the party!

13:10.410 --> 13:11.461
What are you talking about?

13:11.461 --> 13:13.373
The head of Vuuugle
doesn't get us!

13:13.373 --> 13:15.085
Dirk and Amelia already hate us!

13:15.085 --> 13:16.756
It is school
all over again!

13:16.756 --> 13:19.469
-We're too weird here too!
-Paige, calm down.

13:19.469 --> 13:21.091
When you freak out,
it gets in my head,

13:21.091 --> 13:22.762
and by the time
you calm down,
I freak out.

13:22.762 --> 13:25.095
(exhales)
You're right.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.426
We can't change
everything based on--

13:26.426 --> 13:29.429
Oh, we're too weird!
We need to change our video!

13:30.851 --> 13:32.192
♪ Hey! Hey! ♪

13:35.645 --> 13:37.938

Here's my card.

13:39.199 --> 13:40.700
You know what?

13:40.700 --> 13:41.992
Not gonna risk it.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.075
You've been talkin'
a long time

13:45.075 --> 13:47.157
and you haven't said
one thing about me.

13:47.157 --> 13:48.158
Bye!

13:49.119 --> 13:51.371
Wait! I need you.

13:51.371 --> 13:53.293
See, there's these two girls
I'm trying to impress,

13:53.293 --> 13:54.834
-and all I--
-Say no more.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.837
I know exactly
what you're askin'.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.760
In today's video,
we're gonna help Bernard here

14:00.760 --> 14:04.965
impress girls by waxin' off
some of his unruly neck hair.

14:04.965 --> 14:06.516
Wait, what are we doing?

14:08.098 --> 14:09.349
Is-- is it gonna hurt?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.181

14:36.496 --> 14:39.499
Once again, Captain,
perfect vision!

14:40.840 --> 14:42.592
Both:
♪ Pirates at the eye doctor ♪

14:42.592 --> 14:44.504
♪ Pirates
at the eye doctor ♪

14:44.504 --> 14:46.006
Oh, what are we doing?

14:47.267 --> 14:49.179
This is weirder than
our Comebacks video.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.181
We need something
everyone at Vuuugle will get.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.273
Well, what are we gonna do?
The party is in an hour

14:53.273 --> 14:55.275
and we've gone through
every idea in our notebook.

14:55.275 --> 14:56.977
Okay, stay calm.

14:56.977 --> 14:58.939
What do we do when
we don't have any ideas?

14:58.939 --> 15:00.690
The Back and Forth Game.

15:00.690 --> 15:01.901
-I'll start.
-Okay.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.023
-Let's...
-Make...

15:03.023 --> 15:04.284
-A...
-Video...

15:04.284 --> 15:05.235
About...

15:06.446 --> 15:08.158
The...

15:08.158 --> 15:09.659
Funniest...

15:10.660 --> 15:12.202
Thing...

15:12.202 --> 15:13.743
Ever?

15:15.035 --> 15:16.206
-We...
-Are...

15:16.206 --> 15:17.207
Dead.

15:21.001 --> 15:22.752
Liam:
Next up at
the VidView party

15:22.752 --> 15:25.385
is Alan Davis
with his channel,

15:25.385 --> 15:28.258
"My Grandpa Clears His Throat."

15:29.549 --> 15:31.641
(coughs)

15:31.641 --> 15:33.553
(clears throat)

15:34.854 --> 15:36.726
(applause)

15:40.690 --> 15:42.322
Charming.

15:44.864 --> 15:49.869
And finally, we have Paige
and Frankie from Bizaardvark.

15:49.869 --> 15:53.573
(applause)

15:53.573 --> 15:56.246
So, um, we had
this really great idea

15:56.246 --> 15:58.668
and some other ideas
that were like, eh,

15:58.668 --> 16:01.791
probably not as good,
and a lot of stuff
about pirates.

16:01.791 --> 16:03.503
We have no video.

16:03.503 --> 16:05.255
-What?
-(disapproving murmuring)

16:05.255 --> 16:09.639
If you can't make one video,
then why are you even here?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.353
Good question.

16:16.726 --> 16:17.727
(sighs)

16:21.361 --> 16:24.984
This was supposed to be where
we finally found our people.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.526
We did.

16:26.526 --> 16:28.068
They just didn't find us.

16:32.782 --> 16:35.375
-(ram roars)
-(crashing and shattering)

16:35.375 --> 16:38.208
-(roaring continues)
-Anyone else her got a ram?

16:39.539 --> 16:40.750
No?

16:40.750 --> 16:42.422
Probably mine.

16:51.091 --> 16:52.392
(timer dings)

16:52.392 --> 16:53.513
Switch!

17:01.481 --> 17:02.312
Hey!

17:02.312 --> 17:05.315
Guess who just signed
throat-clearing grandpa?

17:05.315 --> 17:06.736
(clears throat)

17:07.696 --> 17:09.529
Me! So...

17:09.529 --> 17:12.071
per our deal,
I am now your agent.

17:12.071 --> 17:14.654
Sorry, Bernie,
Bizaardvark is over.

17:14.654 --> 17:16.826
What? Why?

17:16.826 --> 17:19.079
'Cause for years,
whenever we felt

17:19.079 --> 17:20.500
like weirdos
or we didn't fit in,

17:20.500 --> 17:24.924
we'd say,
"It's okay 'cause one day,
we'll make it into Vuuugle."

17:24.924 --> 17:26.086
And then we did.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.926
And we blew it.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.631
But you guys can't quit.

17:31.631 --> 17:32.972
You're too talented.

17:32.972 --> 17:35.014
You're just saying that
'cause you want to be our agent.

17:35.014 --> 17:37.677
No, I'm saying it
because I'm your friend.

17:37.677 --> 17:40.560
Look, everyday, I wake up
to hear a voice saying,

17:40.560 --> 17:43.353
"Bernie, give up.
You're never gonna be an agent."

17:43.353 --> 17:45.445
And then I say,
"Can you at least wait

17:45.445 --> 17:47.857
"until after I've had
my cereal, Grandma?

17:47.857 --> 17:49.399
I don't need this right now!"

17:50.990 --> 17:53.113
-What's your point?
-My point is,

17:53.113 --> 17:54.574
I never give up.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.075
So, neither should you.

17:56.075 --> 17:59.499
You have over 10,000 fans
who love you.

17:59.499 --> 18:01.291

we totally forgot
about our fans.

18:24.023 --> 18:25.104
They get us.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.527
I can't believe
we almost quit.

18:27.527 --> 18:29.319
Let's go back to Vuuugle
and make the video

18:29.319 --> 18:30.440
we should've made
in the first place.

18:44.334 --> 18:45.915
Sorry we're late
with our post.

18:45.915 --> 18:47.877
We got to Vuuugle
and we doubted ourselves.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.710
But then you reminded us
the only thing that matters

18:50.710 --> 18:52.752
is making videos
we believe in.

You filmed that entire video,

and I stayed home
like you told me.
