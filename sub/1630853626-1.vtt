Maybe it wants us to leave.

51:35.960 --> 51:37.630
-I thought we were past this.
-Maybe it wants us to leave.

51:37.665 --> 51:39.236
Maybe the realtor lied to us.

51:39.271 --> 51:40.468
-What are you doing?
-Maybe there's something

51:40.503 --> 51:41.931
she's not telling us, you know?

51:41.966 --> 51:43.801
Because um,
do you know who lived here?

51:43.836 --> 51:45.803
I don't know who-- who lived
here before us. And maybe--

51:45.838 --> 51:47.409
And why did they leave?

51:47.444 --> 51:49.246
You know why-- why--
why did they have to go?

51:49.281 --> 51:51.842
-You are insane.
-These people, these things--

51:51.877 --> 51:53.448
they-- they--
they want us to know.

51:53.483 --> 51:54.779
They want us to
know what's going on.

51:54.814 --> 51:56.286
What are you doing?

51:56.321 --> 51:57.683
You know who
lived here before us?

51:57.718 --> 51:59.223
I don't know why they
chose me, but they did.

51:59.258 --> 52:00.356
-And-- and-- and--
-You drank?

52:00.391 --> 52:02.292
-Ah, fuck.
-You drank?

52:02.327 --> 52:03.689
I'm not going to
give them the house.

52:03.724 --> 52:05.526
-You fucking drank?
-I'm not going to leave.

52:06.826 --> 52:07.957
That's not what's important.

52:07.992 --> 52:09.299
You said you would never drink.

52:09.334 --> 52:10.498
That's not what's important.

52:10.533 --> 52:11.763
-Listen to me. Listen.
-Asshole.

52:12.365 --> 52:13.798
I'm just trying to protect you.

52:13.833 --> 52:15.239
From what? The boogie man.

52:15.274 --> 52:16.537
Who is trying to get us.

52:16.572 --> 52:18.407
All of the secret
messages that are hidden

52:18.442 --> 52:19.870
in the phone calls.

52:21.445 --> 52:24.545
I've tried everything
I can do to help you. I'm done.

52:25.812 --> 52:30.188
No, no, Katherine.
I need you to believe me.

52:30.957 --> 52:32.652
I'll come back to
get the rest of my stuff

52:32.687 --> 52:33.917
when you're gone. Move!

52:59.648 --> 53:01.582
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am.
I didn't mean to scare you.

53:02.783 --> 53:03.980
It's okay.

53:04.015 --> 53:05.685
Well, I tried calling,

53:05.720 --> 53:07.258
but it seems you're not
answering your phones.

53:08.591 --> 53:09.656
Sorry about that.

53:09.691 --> 53:11.460
Ah, it's no problem.

53:11.495 --> 53:12.923
We got some information
back on those private calls.

53:13.659 --> 53:15.431
Now, you say
the phone was unplugged,

53:15.466 --> 53:16.564
but it was still ringing?

53:17.633 --> 53:19.303
No, that was a mistake.

53:20.105 --> 53:21.866
I thought that
sounded a little crazy.

53:21.901 --> 53:24.242
Even though what we found
was a little crazy in itself.

53:24.904 --> 53:26.706
What do you mean?

53:26.741 --> 53:28.609
Well, normally we can easily
trace these types of calls

53:28.644 --> 53:30.842
because all numbers,
including private ones,

53:30.877 --> 53:32.745
have a trace route.

53:32.780 --> 53:34.912
What was weird was every time
we tried one of your calls,

53:34.947 --> 53:36.287
our systems crashed.

53:36.922 --> 53:38.619
It worked with every
other number we tried.

53:39.221 --> 53:41.424
But yours kept
causing our equipment to fail.

53:44.055 --> 53:45.329
That's weird.

53:50.094 --> 53:51.962
So, we called up some tech guys

53:51.997 --> 53:54.536
and they said the problem
is the traceroute was connected

53:54.571 --> 53:57.770
to a-- What did they
call it? A null number.

53:58.443 --> 53:59.904
Null number?

53:59.939 --> 54:02.775
Meaning it doesn't exist,
like an empty data set.

54:02.810 --> 54:04.447
As if it
appeared out of nowhere.

54:04.482 --> 54:06.416
It had to have
appeared from somewhere.

54:06.451 --> 54:08.913
Well, there is more.
That name your husband gave us,

54:08.948 --> 54:10.519
Valerie, uh...

54:12.083 --> 54:13.423
Valerie Washington.

54:13.458 --> 54:15.854
Yes. Yes.
She died four years ago,

54:15.889 --> 54:17.790
victim of some serial killer.

54:17.825 --> 54:20.056
Now, her murder, along with
four others, were never solved.

54:20.458 --> 54:23.598
There are no witnesses,
no leads. Case is now closed.

54:26.064 --> 54:27.305
I was right.

54:28.473 --> 54:30.506
Mr. Lane,
I didn't see you there.

54:30.541 --> 54:32.101
I was just telling your wife--

54:32.136 --> 54:34.840
About the phone calls and--
and Valerie Washington.

54:37.581 --> 54:40.615
Did-- did she or
any of the other victims

54:40.650 --> 54:41.847
live in this house?

54:42.449 --> 54:45.488
Well, you don't think
she's calling you from beyond?

54:48.152 --> 54:50.394
No, no, no, no. None
of the victims lived here,

54:50.429 --> 54:53.496
as far as I know. Why do
you think they chose you?

54:55.632 --> 54:56.961
I ask myself that every day.

54:58.503 --> 54:59.997
Well, even though
I'm skeptical of all sorts

55:00.032 --> 55:02.868
of paranormal
activity, what do I know?

55:03.937 --> 55:05.409
She calls you again,

55:05.444 --> 55:07.543
maybe you can ask
her who killed her.

55:08.245 --> 55:10.546
Move a couple of our
cases to solved column.

55:12.781 --> 55:14.814
Well, I got to be
getting back to the station.

55:14.849 --> 55:16.816
Sheriff Stance
turned the matter over to me,

55:16.851 --> 55:19.489
so if anything else
comes up, just give me a call.

55:20.091 --> 55:21.557
What happened with the sheriff?

55:23.055 --> 55:24.428
His plate is full.

55:25.156 --> 55:26.760
He loves me.

55:26.795 --> 55:28.432
That may have
something to do with it too.

55:29.134 --> 55:30.731
You folks have a good evening.

57:56.142 --> 57:59.176
Look, you never really know
with these kinds of seizures.

58:00.817 --> 58:02.278
You're telling me
she took all her medication?

58:02.313 --> 58:03.587
Absolutely.

58:04.089 --> 58:05.886
-No drugs?
-No.

58:07.692 --> 58:09.923
I'm telling you, everything
was the way it should be.

58:10.725 --> 58:14.631
My best guess is she might
have some kind of a infection

58:14.666 --> 58:16.897
and she may be fighting it and
her body went into overdrive.

58:16.932 --> 58:18.569
What kind of infection?

58:18.604 --> 58:19.999
I don't know.
I don't think it's meningitis,

58:20.034 --> 58:21.968
but we could run some
tests to find out later.

58:22.503 --> 58:24.608
But... she needs her rest.

58:24.643 --> 58:26.335
And if her temperature goes up

58:44.729 --> 58:46.223

58:46.258 --> 58:48.962
Just a single photo
and some basic information.

A name, age,
birth date, a brief description

58:51.703 --> 58:54.264

No proper files.

58:55.333 --> 58:57.333
How can that be?

58:57.368 --> 58:59.335
Well, newer deputies don't get
access to confidential files.

58:59.370 --> 59:01.777
All we have is what is
already on public records.

59:02.112 --> 59:03.845
But you can get access, right?

59:03.880 --> 59:05.143
Only with
the sheriff's permission.

59:05.178 --> 59:06.782
And he's not
going to grant that.

59:06.817 --> 59:09.279
Look, even if he did...
let me see them,

59:09.314 --> 59:11.050
they're confidential.

And he pulled me off.

59:20.666 --> 59:23.128
He's advised me not to
have any more contact with you.

59:23.867 --> 59:25.735
What?

59:25.770 --> 59:27.363
He's afraid you're going to
give the families false hope.

this generous contribution
