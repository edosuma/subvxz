WEBVTT

00:01.553 --> 00:04.187
With regard to his memory loss,

00:04.187 --> 00:07.445
he could be feigning,
exaggerating or simply...

00:07.465 --> 00:08.848
malingering.

00:08.883 --> 00:11.185
Now, I feel I have no choice,
other than to remand her

00:11.209 --> 00:13.495
to the Seapark Juvenile
Justice Centre in Bangor.

00:13.505 --> 00:14.736
I don't care what you do.

00:14.741 --> 00:16.663
The only one who's honest is Paul.

00:16.783 --> 00:19.145
The police say they have fresh
evidence to put to Spector.

00:19.265 --> 00:20.385
What sort of evidence?

00:20.385 --> 00:23.025
Apparently they have found
a lock-up rented by Spector.

00:23.721 --> 00:24.945
Why are you in this place?

00:25.065 --> 00:26.585
I twisted my sister's arm.

00:26.829 --> 00:28.892
After he broke his sister's
arm, he raped her...

00:28.905 --> 00:30.264
and carried her into the street,

00:30.308 --> 00:32.753
threw her into a passing bin
lorry that crushed her to death.

00:33.052 --> 00:35.768
No-one has any idea how
bad Gortnacull House was.

00:35.825 --> 00:37.504
Are you certain that Baldwin,

00:37.509 --> 00:39.425
Paul Spector, was Jensen's favourite?

00:40.053 --> 00:42.167
Every night and every
day for a full year.

00:42.917 --> 00:43.960
Paul Spector,

00:43.986 --> 00:46.202
I am further arresting you

00:46.233 --> 00:47.751
for the murder of Susan Harper

00:47.765 --> 00:50.815
on the 18th of August 2002.

00:50.865 --> 00:52.680
I insist this interview be suspended.

00:52.697 --> 00:54.407
I must take instruction from Mr Spector.

00:54.415 --> 00:56.289
Do you recognise this
man? Do you know his name?

00:56.302 --> 00:59.009
- David Alvarez.
- This interview stops now.

00:59.129 --> 01:00.239
What is going on?

01:00.923 --> 01:02.265
The police have been clever.

01:02.385 --> 01:04.994
They have something on me
that I can actually remember.

01:14.505 --> 01:15.644
I'd worked that day,

01:15.661 --> 01:17.069
in a Caribbean restaurant.

01:17.978 --> 01:19.346
It was a warm day.

01:20.016 --> 01:21.419
There was thundery rain.

01:23.173 --> 01:24.976
David and I went out after work,

01:25.437 --> 01:26.614
went out drinking.

01:26.911 --> 01:28.509
We went to a local club,

01:28.629 --> 01:29.934
I can't recall the name.

01:31.870 --> 01:33.601
We met Susan Harper there.

01:34.591 --> 01:36.331
She invited us to her house.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.462
I think she shared a house,

01:38.693 --> 01:39.852
but there was no-one there.

01:41.065 --> 01:43.345
- We went up to her room.
- The three of you?

01:44.905 --> 01:45.966
Yes.

01:46.459 --> 01:47.750
What happened?

01:52.136 --> 01:53.614
She and David had sex.

01:55.136 --> 01:56.087
And you?

01:58.465 --> 01:59.625
I watched.

02:01.245 --> 02:02.492
What sort of sex?

02:06.225 --> 02:07.659
Ordinary sex.

02:09.595 --> 02:10.705
What happened then?

02:13.267 --> 02:14.545
David left.

02:17.062 --> 02:19.225
He went out to find more drink.

02:19.895 --> 02:21.240
He left us together.

02:22.318 --> 02:23.255
Go on.

02:27.361 --> 02:28.555
We, erm...

02:31.365 --> 02:34.007
I invited her to try
something a bit different.

02:34.862 --> 02:35.963
What?

02:37.345 --> 02:38.583
A sex game.

02:42.556 --> 02:43.985
What happened was an accident.

02:43.985 --> 02:45.625
A consensual game?

02:46.250 --> 02:46.982
Yes.

02:46.985 --> 02:50.476
Then how did this
David Alvarez individual

02:50.476 --> 02:52.385
come to be found guilty
if he wasn't even there?

02:52.442 --> 02:54.995
And why murder, why not manslaughter?

02:57.415 --> 02:58.707
It's complicated.

02:59.608 --> 03:01.884
Did David Alvarez find
somewhere to sell him drink?

03:02.430 --> 03:03.429
I don't know.

03:03.718 --> 03:04.876
He never came back.

03:07.686 --> 03:09.218
Could I please have some water?

03:19.480 --> 03:21.172
Have you, erm...

03:22.985 --> 03:25.687
... remembered more in
regard to the other charges?

03:27.361 --> 03:28.431
No.

03:32.665 --> 03:36.088
It will look bad if
you stop answering now.

03:36.462 --> 03:37.412
Erm...

03:39.351 --> 03:41.465
just be careful what you say.

03:59.354 --> 04:01.840
So at that point you were
left alone with Susan Harper?

04:02.346 --> 04:03.425
Yes.

04:03.478 --> 04:04.745
What happened then?

04:06.425 --> 04:08.898
I suggested that she
tried something, erm,

04:09.018 --> 04:10.501
a bit more exciting

04:10.510 --> 04:12.370
than the sex that she'd had with David.

04:13.494 --> 04:14.425
What?

04:16.668 --> 04:18.154
I'd been experimenting.

04:18.945 --> 04:19.947
With?

04:29.718 --> 04:31.145
Exhibit 132.

04:34.459 --> 04:35.905
I've never seen these before.

04:35.905 --> 04:38.167
- You admit it's you?
- He admits no such thing.

04:38.185 --> 04:39.565
Experimenting like that,

04:39.579 --> 04:41.780
with sexual asphyxiation. Is that the

04:42.025 --> 04:44.298
sort of behaviour you
involved Susan Harper in?

04:44.305 --> 04:46.340
I advise you not to
answer that question.

04:47.734 --> 04:48.799
Yes.

04:49.532 --> 04:50.450
How?

04:51.041 --> 04:52.208
Specifically.

04:54.025 --> 04:55.902
Her head in a plastic bag.

04:59.352 --> 05:00.751
Tied off at the neck?

05:03.259 --> 05:05.345
No, just a thin plastic bag.

05:05.585 --> 05:06.899
Did you tie her hands?

05:07.196 --> 05:08.115
No,

05:08.502 --> 05:09.496
her hands were free.

05:09.536 --> 05:11.387
Was it your suggestion to use the bag?

05:11.826 --> 05:12.790
Yes.

05:13.069 --> 05:14.037
Why?

05:15.204 --> 05:16.856
For the same reasons as

05:17.020 --> 05:18.476
in these pictures,

05:19.537 --> 05:22.098
to feel in control, to
feel out of control...

05:22.116 --> 05:23.412
to feel powerful,

05:24.140 --> 05:25.441
to feel weak,

05:25.836 --> 05:27.123
to be fearful,

05:27.793 --> 05:30.155
- to be trusted.
- Were you supposed to remove it?

05:31.235 --> 05:32.260
She was...

05:33.006 --> 05:34.400
at the peak of orgasm,

05:34.662 --> 05:35.838
to tear off the bag,

05:37.566 --> 05:40.340
it floods the brain
with oxygen-laden blood,

05:40.798 --> 05:42.440
leads to a feeling of euphoria.

05:42.861 --> 05:44.046
Or death.

05:46.124 --> 05:47.225
Sadly, yes.

05:47.420 --> 05:48.385
Sadly?

05:51.505 --> 05:54.048
Did she understand the risks
involved with such behaviour?

05:55.348 --> 05:56.347
I think so.

05:56.605 --> 05:57.785
Did you explain it?

05:59.020 --> 06:00.347
I don't remember.

06:00.853 --> 06:02.460
Why didn't you remove the bag for her

06:02.468 --> 06:03.752
if she lost consciousness?

06:03.756 --> 06:05.479
Could you not see she was suffocating?

06:07.241 --> 06:08.529
I wasn't looking at her.

06:10.343 --> 06:11.662
I was going down on her.

06:13.522 --> 06:14.533
We'd been drinking,

06:15.057 --> 06:16.904
taken coke. Maybe that's why she died.

06:17.663 --> 06:19.724
And yet David Alvarez,

06:19.981 --> 06:22.130
who wasn't even there at the time,

06:23.475 --> 06:25.705
is serving a life
sentence for the murder.

06:28.033 --> 06:29.107
His choice.

06:29.227 --> 06:31.726
Why would he make that
choice, do you think?

06:33.404 --> 06:34.434
I don't know.

06:35.158 --> 06:36.361
You'll have to ask him.

06:38.843 --> 06:40.841
So what did you do when you
realised what had happened?

06:40.868 --> 06:43.167
Did you call for an ambulance?
Did you call the police?

06:43.797 --> 06:45.373
- No.
- Why not?

06:46.345 --> 06:47.388
It didn't occur to me.

06:47.601 --> 06:48.745
What did you do?

06:49.630 --> 06:50.735
Cleaned up.

06:51.867 --> 06:53.167
Does that account for the presence

06:53.185 --> 06:54.721
of a washing-up bowl by the bed?

06:57.406 --> 06:58.556
Yes.

06:59.746 --> 07:01.486
I fetched the water and washed her.

07:02.489 --> 07:03.616
Emptied it into the bath.

07:03.625 --> 07:05.625
I was meant to bring
it back to the kitchen.

07:06.008 --> 07:07.189
I must have forgotten.

07:07.447 --> 07:08.545
What colour bowl?

07:09.910 --> 07:11.126
Green, I think.

07:11.345 --> 07:13.688
So you just left her there, in her room?

07:13.808 --> 07:15.002
On her bed?

07:16.041 --> 07:17.625
- Yes.
- What did you do then?

07:18.789 --> 07:20.025
I walked the streets.

07:20.046 --> 07:21.185
And after that?

07:23.105 --> 07:24.228
Left London.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.520
I came back to Belfast.

07:25.866 --> 07:27.425
And that's when you became Paul Spector?

07:27.442 --> 07:28.290
Yes.

07:28.295 --> 07:30.226
Did you have any communication
with David Alvarez?

07:30.974 --> 07:31.809
No.

07:32.026 --> 07:33.255
At no point?

07:33.606 --> 07:34.454
No.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.037
I ask you again,

07:37.233 --> 07:38.778
why would he take the blame,

07:39.301 --> 07:40.291
do you think?

07:44.464 --> 07:46.909
He must have felt he was doing
the right thing, I suppose.

07:46.922 --> 07:48.312
And why would he think...

07:49.257 --> 07:50.429
... taking the blame

07:50.487 --> 07:51.734
was the right thing to do?

07:54.029 --> 07:55.192
You tell me.

07:58.509 --> 08:00.364
He said he felt in your debt.

08:03.255 --> 08:04.529
She speaks.

08:06.175 --> 08:08.497
He said he felt he
owed you a great deal.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.045
Because you protected him as a child.

08:11.613 --> 08:12.603
Did I?

08:15.009 --> 08:16.354
You told me...

08:17.588 --> 08:20.607
that Father Jensen didn't
abuse you at Gortnacull.

08:22.272 --> 08:24.417
You said that you
made yourself repulsive

08:24.425 --> 08:25.945
so that he wouldn't touch you.

08:27.657 --> 08:29.015
I don't remember that.

08:30.298 --> 08:32.184
I don't recall talking to you before.

08:33.827 --> 08:36.278
But every boy there
was abused in some way.

08:37.845 --> 08:39.034
No-one escaped.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.347
In fact,

08:42.501 --> 08:44.206
some boys were singled out

08:44.224 --> 08:45.409
for special treatment.

08:47.820 --> 08:49.116
And you

08:50.195 --> 08:52.246
were one of Father Jensen's favourites.

08:53.812 --> 08:55.530
He even had a pet name for you.

08:57.763 --> 08:59.517
He called you "Pretty Boy".

09:01.865 --> 09:03.383
He chose you to be his favourite

09:03.401 --> 09:04.893
for a whole year.

09:08.347 --> 09:10.344
When it came time for you to choose your

09:10.464 --> 09:11.644
successor...

09:12.847 --> 09:15.444
... you looked right past David Alvarez.

09:16.794 --> 09:18.326
You chose another boy.

09:20.066 --> 09:21.322
And, for that,

09:21.704 --> 09:23.293
he was eternally grateful.

09:26.334 --> 09:27.896
Or at least until

09:28.136 --> 09:31.137
it became clear that the
friend that he was protecting

09:31.470 --> 09:34.320
from an unfortunate fatal accident

09:35.656 --> 09:38.129
was actually a friend
who was, at that time,

09:38.151 --> 09:40.745
at the beginning of a
career as a serial murderer.

09:44.490 --> 09:45.986
Drop the charade, Peter.

09:48.001 --> 09:49.462
Own your confession.

09:51.668 --> 09:53.869
Have the courage of your convictions

09:54.340 --> 09:56.315
and admit that you remember it all.

09:58.854 --> 10:00.145
You remember everything.

10:00.145 --> 10:01.908
I'm sorry, but you are intentionally

10:01.926 --> 10:03.825
prejudicing my client's case.

10:03.857 --> 10:06.060
I will want this removed
from the transcripts.

10:07.027 --> 10:09.606
Were you not worried that the
police would come after you?

10:11.568 --> 10:13.491
Come after Peter Baldwin, do you mean?

10:14.201 --> 10:15.613
Of no fixed abode

10:15.733 --> 10:16.869
somewhere in London?

10:18.072 --> 10:19.213
No, I wasn't.

10:20.825 --> 10:22.949
A year later I was Paul Spector,

10:23.362 --> 10:24.623
living in Belfast,

10:25.267 --> 10:27.202
soon to become a married man

10:27.500 --> 10:28.494
with a child.

10:29.745 --> 10:31.864
Truth be told, I didn't give Alvarez and

10:31.873 --> 10:33.302
Susan Harper much thought.

10:37.112 --> 10:37.983
You know,

10:39.106 --> 10:41.614
I've been told a lot about Paul Spector,

10:42.098 --> 10:43.265
since I was shot.

10:45.441 --> 10:47.088
At first I was horrified,

10:49.694 --> 10:51.123
but then, I must admit...

10:53.175 --> 10:54.449
... little by little,

10:55.843 --> 10:57.264
he's started to intrigue me.

10:57.305 --> 10:58.081
Paul,

10:58.201 --> 10:59.312
please stick to the facts

10:59.312 --> 11:01.411
surrounding the death of Susan Harper...

11:01.918 --> 11:03.539
and avoid speculating

11:03.867 --> 11:05.483
about things you can't remember.

11:07.493 --> 11:09.185
The speculation intrigues me.

11:13.801 --> 11:16.673
I'm told that I laid out Sarah
Kay's underwear on her bed,

11:16.691 --> 11:17.985
in the shape of her body.

11:21.828 --> 11:23.572
That's what I used to do as a child.

11:26.116 --> 11:27.341
Lay out my

11:27.909 --> 11:29.596
mother's clothes on her bed,

11:29.911 --> 11:31.074
in her shape,

11:31.487 --> 11:32.865
imagine she was there.

11:37.299 --> 11:38.625
It aroused me.

11:41.388 --> 11:44.167
When I was a wee bit older, 12, 13,

11:45.126 --> 11:47.022
whenever I could, I would obtain

11:47.142 --> 11:48.442
female underwear.

11:49.938 --> 11:51.368
I'd use it to masturbate.

11:54.484 --> 11:55.585
Is that perverse?

11:58.777 --> 12:00.952
Was that the start of
something that led me here?

12:02.778 --> 12:04.207
Or was it earlier?

12:04.985 --> 12:06.185
Gortnacull?

12:07.447 --> 12:09.520
Or earlier still, my mother's death?

12:12.104 --> 12:13.472
I want to know.

12:14.444 --> 12:16.090
I want to know the real me.

12:19.385 --> 12:22.252
Then stop hiding behind
the mask of amnesia.

12:24.525 --> 12:27.015
We're all wearing masks to some extent.

12:28.585 --> 12:29.985
You certainly are.

12:34.065 --> 12:35.361
There are memories,

12:36.143 --> 12:37.221
thoughts that

12:38.043 --> 12:39.494
feel like memories...

12:41.532 --> 12:43.117
... that are starting
to come back to me.

12:43.348 --> 12:46.162
This interview has strayed
way beyond its stated purpose.

12:46.224 --> 12:47.385
And there's a voice.

12:52.217 --> 12:54.330
There's a voice saying,
"We're losing him,

12:54.916 --> 12:56.119
we're losing him."

12:58.547 --> 12:59.493
So,

13:00.306 --> 13:02.192
there must have been at
least one person who cared

13:02.197 --> 13:03.519
whether I lived or died.

13:08.265 --> 13:09.529
That was me.

13:11.545 --> 13:12.945
That was my voice.

13:15.385 --> 13:16.725
And I did care.

13:18.381 --> 13:21.165
I thought death would
be too easy for you,

13:22.403 --> 13:24.042
too easy an escape.

13:25.785 --> 13:28.179
And I didn't want you
to cheat the system.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.465
And I still don't.

13:31.958 --> 13:33.148
I want you to be punished

13:33.148 --> 13:34.577
for the crimes that you've committed.

13:39.164 --> 13:40.420
Rose Stagg

13:41.179 --> 13:42.861
was so right about you.

13:44.785 --> 13:46.501
She saw right through you,

13:47.381 --> 13:51.993
your infantile desire
to have a captive and

13:52.166 --> 13:53.831
captivated audience.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.712
You just want to be noticed,

13:58.835 --> 14:00.891
you want to be the centre of attention,

14:02.259 --> 14:04.265
to have special treatment,

14:04.790 --> 14:06.392
to make your mark.

14:09.620 --> 14:11.817
But it's all just a performance.

14:12.248 --> 14:13.109
All of it.

14:14.037 --> 14:15.564
You perform for me,

14:16.252 --> 14:17.446
for your solicitor,

14:18.187 --> 14:21.388
your doctors, your
nurse, your psychiatrist,

14:21.876 --> 14:23.177
even your family.

14:25.305 --> 14:26.422
It's all just

14:27.088 --> 14:29.987
one big performance...

14:31.585 --> 14:32.860
... as protection

14:33.348 --> 14:34.849
against the dreaded

14:34.969 --> 14:37.126
black hole of your heart.

14:43.865 --> 14:45.241
Well, guess what, Paul,

14:46.653 --> 14:48.043
it's time to grow up.

14:51.501 --> 14:54.590
It's time to take responsibility
for what you've done.

14:56.583 --> 14:58.954
Let's stop this pathetic charade.

15:00.774 --> 15:03.385
I really must insist on a break now.

15:03.505 --> 15:05.569
I need time with my client

15:05.689 --> 15:07.829
to prepare a written
statement about the death

15:07.852 --> 15:09.414
of Susan Harper that he will read.

15:17.698 --> 15:19.810
Interview is being suspended

15:19.930 --> 15:22.678
at 15.47 so that Paul Spector

15:22.687 --> 15:24.494
can consult with his solicitor.

15:26.935 --> 15:28.276
Fetch the detention officer.

16:17.391 --> 16:19.802
Get your hands off me!
Get your hands off me!

16:19.837 --> 16:21.830
Don't touch me! Do you hear me?!

16:22.105 --> 16:23.985
Don't you put your hands on me!

16:24.795 --> 16:26.331
Have you been drinking?

16:42.656 --> 16:44.951
You, escort Mr Healy out of here! You...

16:44.985 --> 16:47.314
- where's that fucking ambulance?!
- It's all right.

16:54.373 --> 16:57.153
It's all right, it's all right.

17:06.054 --> 17:07.385
Drive.

17:08.191 --> 17:09.505
Drive!

18:01.529 --> 18:02.865
I'm shaking.

18:02.985 --> 18:04.570
How much did you see?

18:05.009 --> 18:08.105
Erm, my monitor went
dead. The attack on Gibson.

18:08.515 --> 18:09.825
It didn't stop there.

18:09.945 --> 18:12.128
- What a way for the whole thing to end.
- End?

18:12.248 --> 18:13.705
What do you mean?

18:13.825 --> 18:15.790
We can't possibly represent him now.

18:15.801 --> 18:17.022
Why not?

18:17.211 --> 18:19.662
I've never seen violence
like that before in my life.

18:19.782 --> 18:21.101
What have we just witnessed?

18:21.573 --> 18:23.240
The very thing you described.

18:23.506 --> 18:24.838
Their deep obsession with each other.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.986
The emergence under
duress of "Bad Paul".

18:27.025 --> 18:29.117
If Larson doesn't find evidence of

18:29.130 --> 18:31.070
dissociative disorder,
a split personality,

18:31.093 --> 18:33.485
then we will find a
psychiatrist who does.

18:33.925 --> 18:36.181
Then we play the "not guilty
by reason of insanity" card

18:36.185 --> 18:38.436
or even, if necessary,
"guilty but insane".

18:38.625 --> 18:39.706
I can't, Sean,

18:39.715 --> 18:42.019
- I can't be in the same room with him again.
- I get it.

18:42.214 --> 18:44.665
You admire her. You want
to be her when you grow up.

18:44.917 --> 18:45.947
The fact remains,

18:46.067 --> 18:47.967
if you can't make the accused your focus

18:47.976 --> 18:49.450
then you shouldn't be a defence lawyer,

18:49.530 --> 18:51.926
- probably not a criminal lawyer at all.
- Fine.

18:53.071 --> 18:54.057
What?

18:54.177 --> 18:55.366
You're on your own.

20:36.134 --> 20:37.621
Open your mouth for me.

20:43.114 --> 20:44.607
Bring your teeth together.

20:46.521 --> 20:47.785
Painful?

20:48.635 --> 20:49.778
No, no.

20:49.795 --> 20:52.665
No crunching noises.
Any problems with vision?

20:52.719 --> 20:53.825
No.

20:54.073 --> 20:57.203
I think you have a minimally
displaced zygoma fracture.

20:57.225 --> 21:00.571
You're going to be on a soft
diet for two weeks or so.

21:01.525 --> 21:03.244
Though the bleeding's impressive,

21:03.289 --> 21:05.109
the lacerations small.

21:05.536 --> 21:07.928
Might require a stitch
or two. Irrigate the wound

21:07.945 --> 21:10.463
with lots of normal saline
and I'll take a look.

21:10.712 --> 21:13.171
If you'd like to lie back
on the bed for me, please.

21:31.973 --> 21:34.174
- Any pain?
- Mmm. Some.

21:34.607 --> 21:37.159
- Shall I check for blood in the urine?
- Yes, please.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.514
I'd like to keep you in
overnight for observation.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.723
That won't be necessary.

21:49.746 --> 21:52.195
Don't worry, it'll just
be bed and breakfast.

21:52.553 --> 21:54.513
I'll be back to stitch that eyebrow.

23:18.763 --> 23:21.390
Thought I'd look in on you before I go.

23:22.882 --> 23:24.305
What time is it?

23:24.586 --> 23:26.262
Just after two.

23:27.721 --> 23:30.145
This is my ninth
straight night in a row.

23:30.362 --> 23:32.443
I've been on for 17 hours.

23:33.442 --> 23:35.051
Getting too old for this.

23:37.905 --> 23:40.234
I bet you're glad I saved his life.

23:46.321 --> 23:47.985
How's Tom Anderson?

23:48.513 --> 23:50.067
His arm's broken.

23:51.105 --> 23:53.036
He's undergone a closed reduction to

23:53.042 --> 23:54.862
pull the bones back into position.

23:54.878 --> 23:56.759
- Oh, Jesus.
- He's been sent home with his arm in a cast.

23:59.229 --> 24:02.997
Given that you're less likely to develop

24:03.036 --> 24:06.061
post-traumatic stress
disorder if you don't sleep

24:06.066 --> 24:08.752
after a bad experience,
maybe I should...

24:09.462 --> 24:11.681
keep you awake a wee
bit longer at least.

24:13.895 --> 24:15.821
Don't you have a home to go to?

24:16.192 --> 24:19.034
I do. A wife and five
kids, as it happens,

24:19.239 --> 24:21.669
from a daughter of 12
to a son of seven months.

24:21.691 --> 24:23.105
If I go home now,

24:23.733 --> 24:26.746
it'll be nappy changes
and the four o'clock feed.

24:27.212 --> 24:29.265
Might as well sit with you for a bit.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.589
I'll ask you questions.

24:33.665 --> 24:35.420
- Really?
- Aye.

24:36.196 --> 24:37.425
Go on.

24:40.786 --> 24:42.785
Do you like flowers?

24:45.497 --> 24:46.784
Of course.

24:47.595 --> 24:50.468
Can you play any musical instrument?

24:51.612 --> 24:54.509
I could play the violin
when I was a girl.

24:55.785 --> 24:57.265
Have you ever been happy?

24:57.385 --> 24:58.804
If so, when?

25:00.235 --> 25:01.944
When I was a child,

25:02.585 --> 25:04.187
before my father died.

25:09.186 --> 25:11.373
Have you any real friends?

25:13.426 --> 25:14.745
A few, yeah.

25:16.788 --> 25:18.465
Have you ever wished anyone dead?

25:19.930 --> 25:21.434
Yes, I have.

25:27.248 --> 25:29.518
Are you a good swimmer?

25:31.625 --> 25:32.865
Very.

25:34.047 --> 25:37.549
Are men or women the
stronger, do you think?

25:40.023 --> 25:43.109
- What do you think?
- Oh, women, without a doubt.

25:44.303 --> 25:46.403
In fact, it's time you
hurried up and took over.

25:46.425 --> 25:48.889
I mean, it's going to happen
so why not get on with it?

25:51.179 --> 25:52.865
Which is your favourite season?

25:54.420 --> 25:55.514
Spring.

25:57.936 --> 25:59.783
Has Mr Spector been a threat to himself

25:59.786 --> 26:01.079
or others in the past week?

26:01.145 --> 26:03.355
There have been no more
breaches of protocol

26:03.356 --> 26:04.528
since he's been back.

26:05.675 --> 26:08.175
Anything more from the test results?

26:08.338 --> 26:11.332
Have you found any
compelling inconsistencies?

26:11.625 --> 26:12.841
No, I haven't.

26:13.216 --> 26:14.914
Which is unsurprising

26:15.142 --> 26:16.942
given his professional knowledge.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.016
I know it's in your nature to infer

26:21.016 --> 26:23.100
invisible unconscious processes

26:23.111 --> 26:24.267
behind the memory loss

26:24.269 --> 26:27.230
and that it is an exceptional doctor who

26:27.717 --> 26:30.903
will take the risk of concluding
in writing that someone is

26:30.906 --> 26:32.495
malingering but,

26:32.893 --> 26:34.037
with respect,

26:34.530 --> 26:36.366
that is what I think you should do.

26:37.773 --> 26:38.643
Do you?

26:38.700 --> 26:41.977
The CT head scan with and
without contrast was normal,

26:42.262 --> 26:44.811
the MRI of the brain and the spinal cord

26:44.822 --> 26:46.399
showed normal results.

26:46.594 --> 26:49.008
There's no evidence of
structural brain damage

26:49.015 --> 26:51.771
in the neurological
examinations or neuroimaging.

26:52.272 --> 26:54.005
With his history of lying and

26:54.040 --> 26:56.214
everything that he stands to gain

26:56.657 --> 26:58.394
from exaggeration and

26:58.426 --> 27:00.251
fabrication of the symptoms,

27:01.246 --> 27:03.238
the amnesia has to be malingered.

27:04.545 --> 27:07.046
He's proved how dangerous he is.

27:07.759 --> 27:09.169
It has to be fake.

27:33.543 --> 27:34.704
It's not me.

27:35.486 --> 27:36.377
What?

27:39.371 --> 27:41.370
I look at my body and it's not me.

27:42.305 --> 27:44.357
It'll take a while to
get used to, that's all.

28:03.644 --> 28:05.448
We've had a report, ma'am,

28:05.462 --> 28:07.366
from the Juvenile Offenders' Centre.

28:07.582 --> 28:09.422
It seems that Katie Benedetto

28:09.436 --> 28:11.144
has been self-harming.

28:11.545 --> 28:12.456
How?

28:13.049 --> 28:15.237
Cutting herself with a piece of bone.

28:15.805 --> 28:16.860
What?

28:17.185 --> 28:18.330
They think she must have found it

28:18.344 --> 28:19.846
in her food at some point.

28:21.579 --> 28:22.672
Jesus.

28:26.838 --> 28:30.159
<i>Is there a happy memory
from any part of your life</i>

28:30.173 --> 28:31.465
<i>that you can remember?</i>

28:41.304 --> 28:43.963
I used to think that there
was a black hole inside me

28:44.741 --> 28:46.001
that nothing could fill.

28:48.885 --> 28:50.089
Then I had a daughter.

28:53.357 --> 28:55.682
I remember the first time
that I put her to sleep.

28:57.692 --> 28:58.872
I was standing,

28:59.145 --> 29:00.655
holding her in my arms,

29:01.135 --> 29:02.104
rocking her.

29:04.388 --> 29:06.163
I was looking at her all the time.

29:06.905 --> 29:08.305
She was looking up at me.

29:10.865 --> 29:12.974
I began to feel that she trusted me,

29:14.640 --> 29:15.887
that she felt safe.

29:18.479 --> 29:19.957
She must have done because

29:20.571 --> 29:22.109
her eyelids started closing...

29:23.917 --> 29:24.915
... little by little,

29:26.733 --> 29:27.923
and then she was asleep.

29:32.863 --> 29:34.050
That's a good memory.

29:37.585 --> 29:39.672
Why did you attack Stella Gibson?

29:41.320 --> 29:43.877
Why did you break that young man's arm?

29:54.099 --> 29:55.373
There is a visible

29:55.735 --> 29:57.475
and an invisible world.

29:58.871 --> 30:00.505
That's why people get hurt.

30:10.450 --> 30:11.788
Do you think I'm treatable?

30:14.455 --> 30:15.468
Of course.

30:18.359 --> 30:19.360
Curable?

30:21.747 --> 30:22.812
Hmm,

30:23.224 --> 30:24.474
that's different.

30:34.517 --> 30:36.588
What would you do for
me if I was your patient?

30:40.757 --> 30:43.115
Try to get you to pay attention

30:43.130 --> 30:45.349
wisely to things as they are.

30:47.225 --> 30:49.057
Foster clear thinking and

30:49.579 --> 30:51.056
open-heartedness.

30:52.505 --> 30:55.273
Try to develop the capacity in you

30:55.503 --> 30:57.925
to experience a feeling without

30:58.045 --> 30:59.598
necessarily acting on it.

31:00.465 --> 31:03.306
Try to enable you to see
the difference between

31:03.547 --> 31:05.135
thoughts and reality.

31:11.642 --> 31:13.475
I'd imagine you're a good father.

31:14.156 --> 31:16.181
What do you mean by "good father"?

31:21.105 --> 31:22.403
Someone who is present,

31:24.509 --> 31:25.784
there for his children.

31:37.985 --> 31:40.242
Has anyone ever told
you you sometimes have

31:40.253 --> 31:42.040
bad dreams that you can't remember?

31:42.385 --> 31:44.593
Has your mummy or your
daddy ever told you that?

31:45.065 --> 31:45.864
Yes.

31:45.886 --> 31:48.616
Mummy took me to the doctor's one time.

31:49.830 --> 31:51.077
Have you had any bad dreams

31:51.095 --> 31:53.051
since you've been staying
with Joan and Stephen?

31:53.140 --> 31:54.404
I don't think so.

31:55.145 --> 31:57.021
She hasn't. She's been sleeping well.

31:57.788 --> 31:59.812
Daddy said he had bad dreams like mine

31:59.825 --> 32:01.545
when he was in the children's home.

32:02.942 --> 32:03.723
Did he?

32:05.122 --> 32:06.713
Did he say what he dreamed about?

32:07.274 --> 32:08.592
Frightening things.

32:10.900 --> 32:13.503
How do you feel about your
daddy right now, Olivia?

32:14.919 --> 32:16.223
I love him.

32:16.823 --> 32:17.832
But?

32:18.432 --> 32:20.832
I don't think I'll go
see him for a while.

32:23.801 --> 32:25.785
How long do you think
before you'll see him again?

32:25.846 --> 32:27.490
When I'm grown up I might.

32:27.504 --> 32:28.982
Or if I have a baby.

32:29.803 --> 32:32.583
If I have a baby, I might
go take her to see him.

32:35.164 --> 32:36.688
What happened to your face?

32:38.065 --> 32:39.385
I was in a car accident.

32:42.706 --> 32:43.878
No, I wasn't.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.305
Paul Spector attacked me.

32:57.405 --> 32:59.084
I've got marks like that.

33:06.751 --> 33:07.660
Show me.

33:08.100 --> 33:09.048
I can't.

33:09.787 --> 33:10.667
Why?

33:11.825 --> 33:14.882
They're on my upper thighs
and on the soles of my feet.

33:17.354 --> 33:19.048
I didn't want anyone to know,

33:19.574 --> 33:20.511
to see them.

33:21.925 --> 33:23.105
They were private.

33:25.909 --> 33:27.065
Why did you do it?

33:30.433 --> 33:32.400
I think for the same reason you do.

33:35.113 --> 33:36.289
What's that?

33:36.949 --> 33:37.990
Anger.

33:41.822 --> 33:43.814
What did you have to be angry about?

33:45.579 --> 33:46.690
My father.

33:50.653 --> 33:51.465
Why?

33:53.970 --> 33:55.065
He died.

33:58.267 --> 33:59.073
How?

34:02.340 --> 34:03.385
He was ill.

34:06.278 --> 34:07.385
How old were you?

34:08.583 --> 34:09.638
14.

34:16.801 --> 34:18.373
My father killed himself.

34:19.076 --> 34:20.547
I thought it was an accident.

34:23.428 --> 34:25.313
He chose to ride a motorbike.

34:27.395 --> 34:29.750
Even though I worried about
him every time he went out...

34:31.891 --> 34:33.539
... every night he was late home.

34:38.534 --> 34:40.730
He loved the bike more than he loved me.

34:43.371 --> 34:45.282
Loved the thrill of speed more than he

34:45.295 --> 34:46.493
loved his only daughter.

34:48.975 --> 34:50.690
I don't call that an accident.

34:53.109 --> 34:55.289
Is that why you're
throwing your life away?

34:58.185 --> 34:59.924
You know you can't get him back.

35:02.205 --> 35:03.945
No matter how hard you try.

35:30.794 --> 35:32.427
"There was a man of double deed,

35:33.666 --> 35:35.765
Who sowed his garden full of seed;

35:37.339 --> 35:39.095
When the seed began to grow,

35:40.512 --> 35:42.671
'Twas like a garden full of snow;

35:44.461 --> 35:46.176
When the snow began to melt,

35:47.369 --> 35:49.340
'Twas like a ship without a belt;

35:50.945 --> 35:52.795
When the ship began to sail,

35:54.262 --> 35:57.028
'Twas like a bird without a tail;

35:58.945 --> 36:00.910
When the bird began to fly,

36:01.763 --> 36:04.500
'Twas like an eagle in the sky;

36:06.560 --> 36:09.056
When the sky began to roar,

36:10.420 --> 36:13.417
'Twas like a lion at my door;

36:15.168 --> 36:16.936
When my door began to crack,

36:18.136 --> 36:20.132
'Twas like a stick across my back;

36:22.505 --> 36:25.108
When my back began to smart,

36:26.056 --> 36:29.291
'Twas like a penknife in my heart;

36:31.535 --> 36:33.769
And when my heart began to bleed...

36:36.787 --> 36:38.638
... 'Twas death,

36:39.164 --> 36:40.389
and death,

36:41.895 --> 36:43.535
and death indeed.

37:06.588 --> 37:08.360
I need you to do me a favour.

37:11.844 --> 37:14.441
<i>I know that
everything feels tainted,</i>

37:15.279 --> 37:16.326
<i>polluted.</i>

37:17.305 --> 37:18.318
But it's not.

37:24.905 --> 37:27.456
We all have those voices in our heads,

37:27.904 --> 37:29.948
that tell us we're a disappointment,

37:30.510 --> 37:33.016
that tell us our work is insignificant.

37:34.160 --> 37:35.623
That it's not good enough,

37:35.832 --> 37:37.910
it takes too long, it's too hard.

37:39.892 --> 37:41.584
But when times are tough,

37:43.377 --> 37:45.170
we need tough dreams.

37:46.392 --> 37:47.713
But real dreams,

37:48.189 --> 37:49.134
not lies.

37:50.750 --> 37:52.906
Not an unreality like Paul.

37:56.880 --> 37:59.348
You need to fight for yourself, Katie,

38:01.328 --> 38:02.713
because right now...

38:04.169 --> 38:05.616
... you're in danger.

38:32.130 --> 38:33.316
What's this?

38:34.172 --> 38:35.438
It's your chocolate.

38:36.353 --> 38:38.475
I don't want that chocolate.
I want what he's got.

38:38.954 --> 38:41.032
Mark, you're diabetic.
That's your special chocolate.

38:41.050 --> 38:43.647
I don't like special
chocolate. I want what he's got.

38:44.681 --> 38:46.261
This stuff tastes like dog chocolate.

38:46.265 --> 38:47.784
I'm not eating dog chocolate!

38:49.399 --> 38:50.682
I'm afraid it's this or nothing.

38:50.708 --> 38:52.240
Then give me my money back.

38:52.892 --> 38:54.836
I've spent your money on
the things you asked for.

38:55.604 --> 38:56.772
I want my money back!

38:57.925 --> 38:59.142
Mark, calm yourself.

38:59.262 --> 39:01.335
I'm not a dog. I'm not
eating that shit. I refuse.

39:01.353 --> 39:03.191
Calm down, Mark, or
you'll be restrained.

39:03.311 --> 39:04.279
What did you say to me?

39:04.336 --> 39:06.116
- You called me a homosexual!
- I didn't call you anything!

39:06.151 --> 39:08.789
- You called me a homosexual!
- Calm down now!

40:15.705 --> 40:17.347
<i>We all need love</i>

40:17.963 --> 40:19.788
<i>and we all need nurture.</i>

40:21.105 --> 40:23.230
<i>There's too much death and destruction.</i>

40:24.877 --> 40:26.737
But friends who love you should...

40:28.934 --> 40:30.728
... warm you like the sun.

40:32.890 --> 40:35.007
Make you feel good about yourself.

40:35.847 --> 40:38.249
Not freeze you in their contempt

40:38.435 --> 40:39.878
and in their hate.

40:41.545 --> 40:43.183
Anger corrodes our belief

40:43.196 --> 40:45.199
that anything good can happen to us.

40:48.745 --> 40:51.301
Paul's been destroyed by his anger,

40:52.491 --> 40:53.721
his rage.

40:56.913 --> 40:57.920
And you,

40:59.315 --> 41:00.744
you hurt a friend,

41:02.111 --> 41:03.403
to impress him.

41:07.985 --> 41:09.458
But he doesn't care.

41:13.217 --> 41:15.593
He doesn't even know you exist.

41:58.340 --> 42:00.365
Watch his head, watch his head.

42:00.415 --> 42:03.105
And out, and out. Let's go! Let's go.

42:03.368 --> 42:05.599
Go, go, go!

42:17.857 --> 42:21.505
Fuck off! That's right,
fuck the lot of you!

42:21.625 --> 42:23.836
Fuck off!

43:13.741 --> 43:15.639
You and I were loved so much...

43:17.145 --> 43:19.812
... even if our fathers
couldn't stay around for us.

43:21.105 --> 43:23.863
Maybe we both need to
be held while we grieve,

43:25.295 --> 43:28.825
but it has to be someone who
can feel pain for our pain,

43:30.485 --> 43:31.988
not revel in it.

43:34.136 --> 43:36.134
Not someone who will abandon us.

45:10.225 --> 45:11.790
Sweet Jesus.

45:11.824 --> 45:13.428
Somebody call for an ambulance!

45:13.548 --> 45:15.225
Call an ambulance.

45:15.597 --> 45:17.118
Where's Spector?

45:18.339 --> 45:19.948
Where's Spector?!

45:47.345 --> 45:49.985
Check the treatment room!
The de-escalation room!

45:50.008 --> 45:51.662
Check the kitchen!

46:10.133 --> 46:12.104
Shit! Bailey's room!

46:20.997 --> 46:22.345
Oh, God!

46:27.505 --> 46:29.065
Got him, got him.

46:29.126 --> 46:31.789
Quick. Mind his head, mind
his head, mind his head.

46:34.575 --> 46:36.351
Get the belt, get the belt.

46:38.945 --> 46:40.385
Paul, Paul.

46:50.313 --> 46:52.111
I'm sorry.

46:55.425 --> 46:56.665
Gibson.

47:01.745 --> 47:02.903
OK.

47:03.614 --> 47:04.945
What is it?

47:07.265 --> 47:09.408
- I have to go.
- What's happened?

47:09.528 --> 47:11.433
I can't tell you. I'm sorry.

47:11.605 --> 47:12.898
Is it Paul?

47:16.744 --> 47:18.181
Bye, Katie.

47:50.665 --> 47:52.613
Oh, God, Dr Larson,

47:53.273 --> 47:54.727
I'm sorry,

47:55.099 --> 47:56.297
I'm so sorry.

50:16.979 --> 50:19.071
Paul Spector, the man charged

50:19.099 --> 50:21.552
with the four recent murders
in the Belfast area...

50:22.085 --> 50:23.361
was found dead last night

50:23.378 --> 50:26.042
in one of the bedrooms
of the Foyle Clinic

50:26.101 --> 50:28.504
where he was undergoing
psychiatric assessment.

50:30.181 --> 50:32.262
This morning, an inquiry was launched

50:32.268 --> 50:34.077
into how he had come to die

50:34.105 --> 50:37.628
whilst under level two
observation by clinic staff.

50:38.666 --> 50:42.783
Spector, 32, was found dead at 9.31pm.

50:43.249 --> 50:45.168
While efforts were made to revive him,

50:45.185 --> 50:48.654
he was certified dead
by doctors at 9.51pm.

50:49.464 --> 50:51.425
The Foyle Clinic's leading clinician

50:51.468 --> 50:53.487
was also injured during the incident.

50:53.785 --> 50:56.307
He is in hospital and
in a stable condition.

50:56.695 --> 50:59.305
His injuries are not thought
to be life-threatening.

51:00.019 --> 51:03.603
Another patient, Mark
Bailey, 29, was killed.

51:03.975 --> 51:06.061
His family have been informed.

51:06.361 --> 51:09.607
An inquiry into his death is ongoing.

51:11.394 --> 51:13.586
I can confirm that the PSNI

51:13.608 --> 51:15.312
are not looking for anyone else

51:15.334 --> 51:18.014
in connection with the
murders of Fiona Gallagher,

51:18.064 --> 51:22.032
Sarah Kay, Alice Parker
Monroe or Joseph Brawley.

51:22.487 --> 51:25.468
An inquest will take place
into each of those deaths.

51:26.095 --> 51:30.550
DCI Eastwood will oversee the
preparation of those inquest files.

51:34.035 --> 51:35.999
In light of recent events,

51:36.588 --> 51:37.969
and as of today,

51:38.458 --> 51:40.522
I am standing down from my position

51:40.545 --> 51:43.568
as Gold Commander of Operation Musicman.

51:44.317 --> 51:46.165
In addition, the Chief Constable

51:46.204 --> 51:48.030
has accepted my resignation.

51:49.567 --> 51:51.909
I would like to take
this opportunity to thank

51:51.943 --> 51:54.928
Detective Superintendent
Gibson for all her hard work,

51:55.582 --> 51:57.208
her dedication to duty

51:57.757 --> 52:00.526
and her leadership
during the investigation.

52:02.684 --> 52:03.988
Thank you.

52:13.705 --> 52:15.020
I'm sorry, sir.

53:11.356 --> 53:12.782
Take care, Dani.

53:15.740 --> 53:17.300
And you, ma'am.

53:47.345 --> 53:49.120
"In olden times,

53:49.464 --> 53:52.105
when wishing still did some good...

53:52.733 --> 53:53.859
... there lived a king

53:54.031 --> 53:56.273
whose daughters were all beautiful.

53:57.105 --> 53:59.691
But the youngest was so beautiful

54:00.129 --> 54:01.649
that the sun itself,

54:01.916 --> 54:04.502
who indeed has seen so much,

54:04.813 --> 54:08.304
marvelled every time
it shone upon her face.

54:09.407 --> 54:12.026
In the vicinity of the King's castle

54:12.309 --> 54:15.173
there was a large, dark forest

54:15.617 --> 54:16.987
and in this forest,

54:17.293 --> 54:19.424
beneath an old linden tree,

54:19.779 --> 54:21.249
there was a well.

54:23.175 --> 54:24.825
In the heat of the day,

54:25.139 --> 54:27.975
the Princess would
go out into the forest

54:28.174 --> 54:31.460
and sit on the edge of the cool well.

54:32.331 --> 54:33.824
To pass the time

54:33.944 --> 54:36.182
she would take a golden ball,

54:36.471 --> 54:39.434
throw it into the air and then catch it.

54:40.177 --> 54:42.431
It was her favourite plaything... "

55:29.855 --> 55:31.811
Thank you. Thank you.

55:55.422 --> 55:57.503
"As she was lying in bed,

55:57.623 --> 56:00.867
he came creeping up to her and said,

56:01.244 --> 56:05.225
<i>I am tired and I want to
sleep as well as you do.</i>

56:05.516 --> 56:08.166
<i>Pick me up or I'll tell your father."</i>

56:09.082 --> 56:10.407
With that,

56:10.442 --> 56:12.648
she became bitterly angry

56:12.939 --> 56:15.705
and threw him against the
wall with all her might.

56:16.151 --> 56:19.765
<i>Now you will have your
peace, you disgusting frog!</i>

56:21.582 --> 56:23.420
She's supposed to kiss him,

56:23.448 --> 56:25.127
not throw him against the wall.

56:26.025 --> 56:27.964
That's Disney.

56:28.720 --> 56:30.850
This is the real story.

56:33.298 --> 56:35.171
"But when he fell down,

56:36.004 --> 56:38.064
he was not a frog...

56:39.385 --> 56:40.998
... but a prince

56:41.622 --> 56:43.259
with beautiful,

56:43.379 --> 56:45.070
friendly eyes."
