00:01.290 --> 00:03.949
Julie: The double eviction
rocked the house.

00:03.950 --> 00:07.949
Otev rocked the veto
competition, and Liz and Austin

00:07.950 --> 00:10.989
are rocking each other's world?

00:10.990 --> 00:12.989
This summer's definitely heating
up.

00:12.990 --> 00:14.999
Welcome to "Big Brother."

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
( Cheers and applause )
>> Previously on "Big Brother":

00:24.990 --> 00:31.989
Liz, Austin, Julia, and Vanessa
solidified their new alliance.

00:31.990 --> 00:32.990
Austin's angels.

00:32.990 --> 00:33.990
I love it.

00:33.991 --> 00:35.989
And they had a target set.

00:35.990 --> 00:36.990
Becky.

00:36.990 --> 00:37.950
I'm like, phew!

00:37.951 --> 00:40.989
All right, she's willing to get
blood on her hands and I didn't

00:40.990 --> 00:42.289
put her name out there.

00:42.290 --> 00:42.990
She did.

00:42.990 --> 00:43.990
This is great.

00:43.991 --> 00:46.989
After Becky threw Vanessa
under the bus.

00:46.990 --> 00:51.289
When the whole plan was to
backdoor me, Vanessa knew that,

00:51.290 --> 00:51.990
right?

00:51.990 --> 00:51.991
Yes.

00:51.991 --> 00:55.829
Head of household Liz
considered turning on her Ally.

00:55.830 --> 00:58.829
It completely makes he second
guess trusting her and all the

00:58.830 --> 01:01.119
information that we've given
her.

01:01.120 --> 01:05.989
At the nomination ceremony...
>> I have nominated you, Becky,

01:05.990 --> 01:10.119
and you, Johnny Mac.

01:10.120 --> 01:12.989
Backdoor this her back pocket.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.989
John and Becky are on the
block this week, and although

01:15.990 --> 01:19.999
those are great options I could
very easily make a big move and

01:20.000 --> 01:20.990
backdoor Vanessa.

01:20.991 --> 01:22.989
Hoping to build a
relationship with Austin and the

01:22.990 --> 01:24.989
twins...
>> I've been after Vanessa for a

01:24.990 --> 01:25.990
while now.

01:25.991 --> 01:27.989
I just haven't been telling
anyone.

01:27.990 --> 01:30.989
Johnny Mac also went on the
attack against Vanessa.

01:30.990 --> 01:32.989
She's just... like word.

01:32.990 --> 01:38.119
She spins things... I don't
get the paranoia.

01:38.120 --> 01:41.119
At a rockin' veto competition...

01:41.120 --> 01:43.989
♪ bring me that butter ♪ >> oh!

01:43.990 --> 01:47.989
The twin doubled up on power.

01:47.990 --> 01:50.989
You have won the power of veto.

01:50.990 --> 01:55.699
I have all the power this
week, and I can do.

01:55.700 --> 01:56.829
♪ Whatever ♪ I want.

01:56.830 --> 01:58.989
And she considered finally
making a big move.

01:58.990 --> 02:02.989
I just want to put her out of
her misery and put her up on the

02:02.990 --> 02:03.290
block.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.989
That way she can cry in jury.

02:04.990 --> 02:08.989
But at the veto meeting, Liz
played it safe.

02:08.990 --> 02:10.999
I have decided to not use the
power of veto.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.989
Tonight, will the dentist's
brush with glory come on an end?

02:15.990 --> 02:18.989
Or will the Colorado girl be
forced to take a hike?

02:18.990 --> 02:23.989
Plus, your first look inside the
jury house.

02:23.990 --> 02:24.990
What!

02:24.991 --> 02:27.989
And a new battle for power
begins.

02:27.990 --> 02:32.289
All this live on "Big Brother."

02:32.290 --> 02:32.990
Hey, Steve?

02:32.991 --> 02:34.990
Yes.

02:38.990 --> 02:40.870
Captioning funded by CBS
( Cheers and applause )

03:13.990 --> 03:15.699
Julie: Good evening.

03:15.700 --> 03:15.990
I'm Julie chen.

03:15.991 --> 03:17.989
Welcome to "Big Brother."

03:17.990 --> 03:21.989
In the aftermath of last week's
stunning events during the

03:21.990 --> 03:25.989
double eviction, the house
seemed firmly divided.

03:25.990 --> 03:29.989
But after only a few days,
loyalties have been questioned,

03:29.990 --> 03:33.989
new alliances have formed, and
no one is safe.

03:33.990 --> 03:35.989
So, who will be the next target?

03:35.990 --> 03:37.989
We'll find out soon enough.

03:37.990 --> 03:42.999
But first, it's deja vu all over
again as friends Becky and John

03:43.000 --> 03:46.989
find themselves on the chopping
block for the second time this

03:46.990 --> 03:47.990
summer.

03:47.991 --> 03:55.991
The only difference is tonight,
one of them must leave.

04:01.990 --> 04:05.989
This week was not the time to
backdoor Vanessa.

04:05.990 --> 04:07.989
Since everyone else is targeting
Vanessa, I don't have to get any

04:07.990 --> 04:09.989
more blood on my hands.

04:09.990 --> 04:12.539
I'm going to let someone else do
my dirty work.

04:12.540 --> 04:13.000
You all right?

04:13.001 --> 04:14.989
Yeah.

04:14.990 --> 04:16.989
It's all right, buddy.

04:16.990 --> 04:19.989
Liz doesn't use the veto and
nominations remain the same with

04:19.990 --> 04:26.949
Becky up there next to John, and
I'm relieved.

04:26.950 --> 04:28.989
Although it wouldn't be worst if
Johnny Mac were to be the one to

04:28.990 --> 04:31.989
go to jury, Becky is a better
target right now because she's a

04:31.990 --> 04:33.989
better competitor, in my
opinion.

04:33.990 --> 04:35.409
I just need to make sure that
Austin's angel stay on the the

04:35.410 --> 04:38.949
same page this week because the
three of us control the vote.

04:38.950 --> 04:40.989
Liz is terrified of getting
blood on her hand.

04:40.990 --> 04:44.989
She would not pull off a
blindside on someone, so I'm

04:44.990 --> 04:48.539
right where I began.

04:48.540 --> 04:51.989
But if I'm confident in my
people skills, I will stay in

04:51.990 --> 04:51.991
this game.

04:51.991 --> 04:54.989
What's up?

04:54.990 --> 04:57.989
That was so awkward.

04:57.990 --> 04:58.990
Her speech?

04:58.990 --> 04:59.990
Yes.

04:59.991 --> 05:03.989
One week ago I was h.O.H. And
you were very comfortably on

05:03.990 --> 05:07.989
this couch, not just you but so
were your sister and Austin.

05:07.990 --> 05:11.989
I would appreciate it if you
used power on me and all will be

05:11.990 --> 05:12.990
forgotten.

05:12.991 --> 05:15.989
She basically said if you
don't take me off the block, I'm

05:15.990 --> 05:16.990
coming after you.

05:16.990 --> 05:17.290
What?

05:17.291 --> 05:22.989
You're in my room.

05:22.990 --> 05:23.990
Do you need a minute?

05:23.991 --> 05:26.699
It doesn't matter.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.989
Her speech was...
>> I think people look way too

05:28.990 --> 05:29.990
much at these speeches.

05:29.991 --> 05:31.949
Fair enough.

05:31.950 --> 05:33.989
It is officially my nap time.

05:33.990 --> 05:34.990
Okay.

05:34.991 --> 05:42.991
Give me a kiss.

05:45.990 --> 05:47.699
Can I join?

05:47.700 --> 05:52.539
Come on down!

05:52.540 --> 05:59.989
Losers' court.

05:59.990 --> 06:03.409
Right afterwards, "oh, your
speech is so good."

06:03.410 --> 06:03.990
Oh, shut up.

06:03.991 --> 06:06.989
Don't you just hate her?

06:06.990 --> 06:08.989
Austin doesn't like me and
Vanessa doesn't like me.

06:08.990 --> 06:14.119
So with that being said, I'm not
in a good spot.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.989
I feel a little down right
now because I'm on the block

06:16.990 --> 06:20.289
against my main alliance member
Becky, but I feel pretty solid

06:20.290 --> 06:22.989
with Austin and the twins.

06:22.990 --> 06:24.829
We've had a couple of good
conversations this week.

06:24.830 --> 06:27.989
My best move is the dead fish
strategy again... just lay out on

06:27.990 --> 06:35.990
the table and don't do anything
until Thursday.

06:41.410 --> 06:45.989
Yeah, girl, you put some
spanx on.

06:45.990 --> 06:46.990
Hello, Big Brother.

06:46.991 --> 06:50.989
Me and Meg want to let the whole
world know, we are getting

06:50.990 --> 06:50.991
engaged!

06:50.991 --> 06:53.999
We're getting married!

06:54.000 --> 06:54.990
We're in love!

06:54.991 --> 06:59.989
Not only is James important
for my game but he's also very

06:59.990 --> 07:01.989
important for my sanity.

07:01.990 --> 07:03.989
Here you go, grandma.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.989
Get out of here!

07:05.990 --> 07:06.990
Just drink.

07:06.990 --> 07:07.700
Dont fight it.

07:07.701 --> 07:09.989
Get out of here!

07:09.990 --> 07:10.990
Good job.

07:10.991 --> 07:13.989
Aahh!

07:13.990 --> 07:16.989
Get away from me.

07:16.990 --> 07:18.989
Get away from me.

07:18.990 --> 07:20.989
Shhh!

07:20.990 --> 07:24.989
But if games really thinks
we're engaged, he's crazy.

07:24.990 --> 07:27.989
Tell her, her lipstick looks
good with her shirt.

07:27.990 --> 07:32.989
Meg, your lipstick matches
your shirt.

07:32.990 --> 07:34.989
Luscious.

07:34.990 --> 07:36.989
"Your lips look luscious."

07:36.990 --> 07:38.989
Your lipstick looks luscious.

07:38.990 --> 07:40.119
Oh, my God!

07:40.120 --> 07:43.989
Our group that we started out
with from day one has all been

07:43.990 --> 07:48.989
taken out pretty much, and it's
just down to me and Meg in this

07:48.990 --> 07:48.991
game.

07:48.991 --> 07:50.829
What's wrong with my bathing
suit?

07:50.830 --> 07:51.989
It looks good.

07:51.990 --> 07:52.990
Like, I like it.

07:52.990 --> 07:53.990
Shut up!

07:53.991 --> 07:56.989
It's vibrant.

07:56.990 --> 07:59.989
It's day 60-something, you know,
I haven't made a breakthrough

07:59.990 --> 08:03.989
yet, but I think Meg has a crush
for me, so I'm not giving up.

08:03.990 --> 08:04.290
She loves it.

08:04.291 --> 08:12.291
I can't stand him!

08:13.990 --> 08:17.699
I've been the guy in the
house to prank people, to scare

08:17.700 --> 08:17.990
people all the time.

08:17.991 --> 08:20.999
I just know that you can't do
the same thing over and over so

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
I gotta step my game up.

08:36.990 --> 08:44.990
All right, my work here is done.

08:45.990 --> 08:46.990
Where's my basket?

08:46.990 --> 08:47.990
Where is it?

08:47.991 --> 08:51.539
Did someone lose... someone
moved my basket.

08:51.540 --> 08:54.409
What's in my bed?

08:54.410 --> 08:58.989
( Laughter ) >> Merry Christmas!

08:58.990 --> 09:06.989
Ho-ho-ho.

09:06.990 --> 09:08.119
You took your hat off.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.989
Look at Steve.

09:09.990 --> 09:11.119
He's so pissed.

09:11.120 --> 09:14.119
Watching poor Steve unwrap
his dentist chair, I started to

09:14.120 --> 09:15.989
feel a little bad for him.

09:15.990 --> 09:16.990
Oh!

09:16.991 --> 09:18.409
Oh!

09:18.410 --> 09:19.949
He's got the guns out.

09:19.950 --> 09:20.989
No, I love this.

09:20.990 --> 09:23.989
I'm going to keep doing it to
him.

09:23.990 --> 09:26.989
79, 80, 81, 82.

09:26.990 --> 09:30.409
And he's going to go over two
minute so I'm going to stop

09:30.410 --> 09:30.990
counting.

09:30.991 --> 09:33.989
Once again, mission
accomplished.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.990
I had to keep the freshness in.

09:41.990 --> 09:44.989
What do you think of
everything so far?

09:44.990 --> 09:45.990
Define "everything."

09:45.991 --> 09:48.989
Our position in the game
right now.

09:48.990 --> 09:52.989
I'm pretty sure I'm staying this
week, so now Steve's all I got

09:52.990 --> 09:55.989
in this game, and we have to
figure out where we're going to

09:55.990 --> 09:57.289
go from here.

09:57.290 --> 09:59.409
We need some protection somehow.

09:59.410 --> 10:03.989
What you're saying, then, is
that we should buddy-buddy up

10:03.990 --> 10:05.989
and make some typeave group.

10:05.990 --> 10:07.409
Who do you think, though?

10:07.410 --> 10:09.289
I'm sure you already have an
opinion.

10:09.290 --> 10:12.989
Guwith Austin and the twins.

10:12.990 --> 10:14.989
You go with James and Meg?

10:14.990 --> 10:16.989
Exactly.

10:16.990 --> 10:19.989
I think with the twins and
Austin, we're the smaller threat

10:19.990 --> 10:20.990
in the group.

10:20.991 --> 10:24.989
If we go with James and Meg,
we're the bigger threat in the

10:24.990 --> 10:24.991
group.

10:24.991 --> 10:31.539
Yes., which is why I think a
large group would be our best

10:31.540 --> 10:31.990
bet.

10:31.990 --> 10:32.990
And lock it down.

10:32.991 --> 10:34.990
And lock it down.

10:38.990 --> 10:41.989
I'm feeling really vulnerable
after my h.O.H. Reign, because I

10:41.990 --> 10:44.989
wasn't sure I made the right
decision with Jackie.

10:44.990 --> 10:52.990
I solidified by alliance Austin
and with Johnny.

10:56.990 --> 10:57.990
You guys don't have to knock.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.989
You can just barge in.

10:59.990 --> 11:01.989
We can just barge in?

11:01.990 --> 11:04.989
Anyway, Julia has something
to tell you.

11:04.990 --> 11:06.409
Are you a twin?

11:06.410 --> 11:09.989
Johnny Mac, I'm a triplet,
there's one more person coming

11:09.990 --> 11:11.989
next week.

11:11.990 --> 11:15.989
But, anyway, I just wanted to
tell you that we definitely want

11:15.990 --> 11:18.989
to work with you.

11:18.990 --> 11:21.289
Yeah, sure, I'm on board.

11:21.290 --> 11:21.990
You're awesome!

11:21.991 --> 11:23.989
You guys are geniuses.

11:23.990 --> 11:24.990
I wish I had thought of it.

11:24.991 --> 11:26.989
I did!

11:26.990 --> 11:30.699
We've all heard about the
Vanessa craziness and...

11:30.700 --> 11:33.989
we're over it.

11:33.990 --> 11:37.989
There's a lot of stuff that,
like, you and Becky and other

11:37.990 --> 11:40.989
people in the house have told us
about her that we have

11:40.990 --> 11:42.989
suspicions and it's all been
confirmed this week.

11:42.990 --> 11:42.991
Yeah.

11:42.991 --> 11:45.989
This is the perfect time to jump
on the Johnny Mac and Steve

11:45.990 --> 11:46.290
train.

11:46.291 --> 11:49.989
They're pretty smart, they're
fierce competitors.

11:49.990 --> 11:52.989
They're on the outside look in
and they don't really have a

11:52.990 --> 11:55.989
team so we're giving them the
support they need.

11:55.990 --> 11:57.989
So we're just playing dummy.

11:57.990 --> 11:59.989
We're not telling ourselves
anymore...

11:59.990 --> 12:01.989
oh, what's this?

12:01.990 --> 12:02.990
Exactly what you think it is.

12:02.990 --> 12:03.990
Yeah!

12:03.991 --> 12:06.699
Us four have started an
alliance.

12:06.700 --> 12:07.989
And you're not in it.

12:07.990 --> 12:09.989
Yeah, you're not included.

12:09.990 --> 12:12.989
I think the plan now is backdoor
you the next week.

12:12.990 --> 12:14.989
It's us and then Vanessa.

12:14.990 --> 12:18.289
Obviously, she has to be
involved with everything.

12:18.290 --> 12:20.989
What's the discussion.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.989
As far as Vanessa, it's
apparent she's willing to do

12:22.990 --> 12:23.990
anything to win this game.

12:23.991 --> 12:27.999
The point is we are all on the
same page talking strategically

12:28.000 --> 12:30.989
about when we want to take her
out.

12:30.990 --> 12:30.991
Right.

12:30.991 --> 12:33.699
We are scared to put Vanessa
on the block.

12:33.700 --> 12:34.989
I want to do it.

12:34.990 --> 12:42.990
I've wanted to do this for
weeks.

12:45.990 --> 12:50.989
Okay, okay, so just kind of
so you guys know, like, my

12:50.990 --> 12:53.989
strategy throughout the week is,
you know, up until this point,

12:53.990 --> 12:56.989
Johnny Mac's been the ultimate
pawn.

12:56.990 --> 13:01.989
Vanessa and Steve will want him
to stay.

13:01.990 --> 13:05.989
James and Meg will prefer me to
stay.

13:05.990 --> 13:11.699
So the votes do come down to
where do Austin and Julia lie?

13:11.700 --> 13:11.990
Right.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.989
You guys will decide.

13:13.990 --> 13:20.989
So for me and my game...
>> oh, are you guys...

13:20.990 --> 13:22.989
we're going to go outside.

13:22.990 --> 13:25.289
I know, like, it's
intimidating because I win

13:25.290 --> 13:32.699
things, but if I stay in the
house, like, everybody knows my

13:32.700 --> 13:32.990
target.

13:32.991 --> 13:34.409
I need Vanessa out.

13:34.410 --> 13:34.990
Yeah.

13:34.991 --> 13:36.989
It's not even a question.

13:36.990 --> 13:39.989
Either she takes me out or I
take her out, and that's one

13:39.990 --> 13:41.989
extra week in the house for both
of you guys.

13:41.990 --> 13:43.989
No, you're right.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.699
I stay true to my targets.

13:46.700 --> 13:47.989
All righty, guys.

13:47.990 --> 13:48.999
Have a good day.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.989
We'll see you outside!

13:52.990 --> 13:55.989
Both the nominees that we
have on the block are going

13:55.990 --> 13:58.989
after Vanessa, so we have to
decide which one of them is best

13:58.990 --> 14:03.990
for our own game.

14:05.990 --> 14:08.989
Julie: Coming up, Steve
spends a lot of time alone in

14:08.990 --> 14:12.989
the house, but wait till you see
who's standing behind him back

14:12.990 --> 14:13.990
home.

14:13.991 --> 14:16.989
Then, it's the live vote and
eviction.

14:16.990 --> 14:20.989
Who will leave the house and
become the third member of the

14:20.990 --> 14:20.991
jury?

14:20.991 --> 14:22.990
Stay with us.

14:55.990 --> 14:56.990
Julie: Welcome back to "big

14:56.990 --> 14:57.830
brother."

14:57.831 --> 15:01.989
Let's go to the living room and
check in with the houseguests.

15:01.990 --> 15:04.989
Hello, everyone.

15:04.990 --> 15:06.999
( All snap fingers ).

15:07.000 --> 15:07.990
Julie: Oh!

15:07.991 --> 15:09.989
I like the coordination.

15:09.990 --> 15:12.699
Who planned that?

15:12.700 --> 15:13.700
Austin did.

15:13.700 --> 15:13.990
Okay.

15:13.991 --> 15:15.989
Well, how's everyone doing in
there?

15:15.990 --> 15:18.989
Good!

15:18.990 --> 15:22.409
Julie: Well, you know, it
seems like these days living in

15:22.410 --> 15:26.409
the "Big Brother" house has
actually become a very scary

15:26.410 --> 15:26.990
experience.

15:26.991 --> 15:34.991
Take a look.

15:35.990 --> 15:37.829
Oh, my God!

15:37.830 --> 15:39.989
What the... stop!

15:39.990 --> 15:47.990
Aarrggh!

15:48.990 --> 15:50.989
Oh, my God, James!

15:50.990 --> 15:51.990
I hate you!

15:51.991 --> 15:59.991
Yeah!

16:00.990 --> 16:03.989
What are you doing?

16:03.990 --> 16:04.990
Oh!

16:04.991 --> 16:08.989
Oh, my God!

16:08.990 --> 16:09.990
Yeah!

16:09.991 --> 16:12.999
Julie: James, what is with
all the pranks, James?

16:13.000 --> 16:17.989
Julie, you know, I get bored
and I gotta do stuff to keep

16:17.990 --> 16:18.990
myself occupied.

16:18.991 --> 16:22.989
Julie: Well, at Julia's
expense most of the time.

16:22.990 --> 16:22.991
Yes.

16:22.991 --> 16:26.989
Julie: You are, Julia, as
one of James' favorite targets

16:26.990 --> 16:29.989
how do you keep falling for
these scares time after time and

16:29.990 --> 16:31.539
are you planning to seek
revenge?

16:31.540 --> 16:31.990
Yes.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.989
It is very hard to seek revenge
on James because he's so sneaky

16:34.990 --> 16:38.699
and he knows when people are
going to scare him, but I'm

16:38.700 --> 16:40.989
planning something so you better
watch your back.

16:40.990 --> 16:42.989
You better sleep with one eye
open.

16:42.990 --> 16:44.949
Julie: We'll be there
watching.

16:44.950 --> 16:48.989
Well, everyone, you were all
excited to make it to the otev

16:48.990 --> 16:49.990
competition this week.

16:49.991 --> 16:53.989
Meg, I have just one word for
you... ouch.

16:53.990 --> 16:57.989
Take a look.

16:57.990 --> 17:01.999
Oh, no!

17:02.000 --> 17:10.000
Oh!

17:10.950 --> 17:12.289
Julie: Meg, you're
laughing.

17:12.290 --> 17:15.989
I trust you have recovered.

17:15.990 --> 17:16.990
I have recovered.

17:16.991 --> 17:19.989
I think my family and friends
are probably severely

17:19.990 --> 17:23.989
embarrassed and trying to get
over the shock of that.

17:23.990 --> 17:27.989
Julie: Well, you all have
made it to day number 64 in the

17:27.990 --> 17:28.990
"Big Brother" house.

17:28.991 --> 17:31.989
That is a long time away from
your families and your loved

17:31.990 --> 17:32.950
ones.

17:32.951 --> 17:34.989
Steve, what are you missing most
from home?

17:34.990 --> 17:36.989
Oh, I miss my family so much.

17:36.990 --> 17:41.989
I mean, I talk to my mom on a
daily basis probably on the

17:41.990 --> 17:41.991
phone.

17:41.991 --> 17:45.989
They're just such a huge part of
my life, and I've never gone

17:45.990 --> 17:48.989
more than a week or to without
talking to them so being

17:48.990 --> 17:50.539
here 64 days is just insane.

17:50.540 --> 17:51.989
Julie: I can imagine it is.

17:51.990 --> 17:52.990
Thanks, everybody.

17:52.991 --> 17:58.829
I'll be back in just a few
minutes for tonight's live vote

17:58.830 --> 17:59.989
and eviction.

17:59.990 --> 18:02.989
Steve's social game may not be
his strength but being on "big

18:02.990 --> 18:05.409
brother" has earned eman
impressive number of friends

18:05.410 --> 18:08.989
back home.

18:08.990 --> 18:08.991
Going in?

18:08.991 --> 18:13.119
I'm going to spend some time
out here.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.829
Some alone, relaxing time.

18:15.830 --> 18:16.410
I'll see you.

18:16.411 --> 18:21.989
I'll see you soon, Mr. James.

18:21.990 --> 18:22.990
Hi, mom.

18:22.990 --> 18:23.990
I'm doing good.

18:23.991 --> 18:25.699
You don't need to worry about
me.

18:25.700 --> 18:32.540
My house is good.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.989
Hi, I'm Steve's mom, Kathy.

18:39.990 --> 18:42.989
Steve and I have been watching
"Big Brother" since the very

18:42.990 --> 18:44.699
first season together.

18:44.700 --> 18:48.699
When Steve was growing up, he
thoughtf thoughtf thoughtful and

18:48.700 --> 18:48.990
kind.

18:48.991 --> 18:52.119
He also enjoyed learning
instruments.

18:52.120 --> 18:55.989
He started on violin when he was
four, then started piano right

18:55.990 --> 18:55.991
after that.

18:55.991 --> 18:58.289
He was the number one ranked
bass trombonist in New York

18:58.290 --> 18:58.990
state.

18:58.990 --> 18:59.990
You were on the chess team.

18:59.991 --> 19:01.999
I was not on the chess team.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.989
Would you like me to list my
high school activities, marching

19:06.990 --> 19:10.989
band, concert band, regular
orchestra, and select strings.

19:10.990 --> 19:13.989
And I was in whiz quiz for a
while.

19:13.990 --> 19:17.989
My name is Ron Moses and I'm
Stephen's father.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.989
Steve has always been a loner.

19:19.990 --> 19:21.989
He spent so much time with his
studies.

19:21.990 --> 19:25.829
He didn't spend enough time
socializing.

19:25.830 --> 19:28.989
I've been fighting my way out
of a shell since I graduated

19:28.990 --> 19:29.990
high school.

19:29.990 --> 19:30.990
What were you like?

19:30.991 --> 19:33.829
I didn't have friends and I
missed the big picture.

19:33.830 --> 19:36.989
Steve has always talked to
himself to a degree.

19:36.990 --> 19:43.989
But Steve knows exactly who is
out here, including me,

19:43.990 --> 19:45.989
listening to what he has to say.

19:45.990 --> 19:49.539
My mom would kill me if I
didn't use the veto tomorrow.

19:49.540 --> 19:52.949
The town and village of
gouvernor, are so thrilled to

19:52.950 --> 20:00.539
have somebody from their little
town on national TV.

20:00.540 --> 20:05.409
Let's go, Steve!

20:05.410 --> 20:08.989
As mayor of the village of
gouvenor, I'd like to welcome

20:08.990 --> 20:11.989
everyone here on this glorious
evening and recognize one of our

20:11.990 --> 20:12.999
own, Steve Moses.

20:13.000 --> 20:20.989
We've declared this Steven Moses
day in the greater gouvernor

20:20.990 --> 20:22.990
area.

20:28.990 --> 20:29.990
This is a big day.

20:29.990 --> 20:30.990
The park is filled.

20:30.991 --> 20:32.989
We have our local high school
band.

20:32.990 --> 20:36.989
I've got the shirt on, and we're
particularly proud of Steve.

20:36.990 --> 20:38.989
I'm enthusiastic, and so is
everybody around me.

20:38.990 --> 20:41.989
Oh, I think Steve is a major
personality in town.

20:41.990 --> 20:46.289
You see people from 90 to 2
wearing Steve shirts.

20:46.290 --> 20:51.989
I don't think there's too
much people in gourvenor, that

20:51.990 --> 20:53.699
don't know about Steve Moses
right now.

20:53.700 --> 20:56.989
I traveled 40 minute to get
here because Steve is my

20:56.990 --> 20:58.989
favorite player on "big
brother."

20:58.990 --> 21:01.119
That's what is so cool, that
somebody from this little tiny

21:01.120 --> 21:04.989
town can actually win "big
brother," and I hope that

21:04.989 --> 21:05.999
Tell me about your home town.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.409
I never asked you about it.

21:07.410 --> 21:10.119
Very small town, very farm
based.

21:10.120 --> 21:10.990
4,000 people.

21:10.990 --> 21:11.990
Oh, my God, stop.

21:11.991 --> 21:14.989
I know Steve from marching
band and I also went to prom

21:14.990 --> 21:17.989
with him my junior year.

21:17.990 --> 21:21.989
Now that Steve's been on "big
brother," he's going to be

21:21.990 --> 21:22.990
famous around here for a long
time.

21:22.990 --> 21:23.290
He's amazing.

21:23.291 --> 21:24.699
He's nerdy.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.989
He's... he's just awesome.

21:27.990 --> 21:30.119
From watching Steve be on
"Big Brother," I want to be on

21:30.120 --> 21:33.289
"Big Brother," too.

21:33.290 --> 21:34.989
Whoa!

21:34.990 --> 21:34.991
Whoa!

21:34.991 --> 21:36.949
Look at those moves!

21:36.950 --> 21:36.990
Wow!

21:36.991 --> 21:37.990
Look at that.

21:37.990 --> 21:38.990
What creativity.

21:38.991 --> 21:41.989
Being in the "Big Brother"
house now is great because he

21:41.990 --> 21:45.989
can actually kick back and learn
to have fun with others.

21:45.990 --> 21:47.539
Where does dthat come from?

21:47.540 --> 21:51.989
It's beyond worded how happy
and thrilled and proud I am.

21:51.990 --> 21:54.989
I miss Steve more than anything
in the world, and I love him

21:54.990 --> 21:56.989
more than anything there is.

21:56.990 --> 21:58.989
I really appreciate how
everybody came out.

21:58.990 --> 22:02.989
I can't wait till Steve finds
out about everything that's

22:02.990 --> 22:03.540
happened here.

22:03.541 --> 22:04.699
He's going to be amazed.

22:04.700 --> 22:05.989
I love you, Steve!

22:05.990 --> 22:06.990
Steve!

22:06.990 --> 22:07.410
Steve!

22:07.410 --> 22:07.990
Steve!

22:07.990 --> 22:08.990
Steve!

22:08.990 --> 22:09.120
Steve!

22:09.120 --> 22:09.990
Steve!

22:09.991 --> 22:11.989
Steve!

22:11.990 --> 22:14.999
Julie: Coming up, it's the
live vote and eviction.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.989
Either Becky or Johnny Mac will
be joining me out here live

22:17.990 --> 22:20.989
before heading off to the jury
house.

22:20.990 --> 22:22.990
Stay with us.

22:40.990 --> 22:41.990
( Cheers and applause )
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big

22:41.990 --> 22:42.990
brother."

22:42.991 --> 22:45.539
Shelli may have known she was
headed to the jury house last

22:45.540 --> 22:52.989
week, but who followed next was
completely unexpected.

22:52.990 --> 22:57.989
Getting evicted out of the
"Big Brother" house is an

22:57.990 --> 22:59.289
absolutely out-of-body
experience.

22:59.290 --> 23:02.829
If Vanessa was the first person
to walk through this door, I'd

23:02.830 --> 23:03.989
be happy.

23:03.990 --> 23:06.989
So funny how much she's able to
spin things around.

23:06.990 --> 23:10.989
Clay and I were expendable to
her and ultimately I really,

23:10.990 --> 23:15.989
truly do believe she is the
reason for our demise.

23:15.990 --> 23:18.949
What!

23:18.950 --> 23:19.989
Jackie!

23:19.990 --> 23:19.991
No!

23:19.991 --> 23:22.989
Oh, at least we get to hang out.

23:22.990 --> 23:22.991
What happened?

23:22.991 --> 23:25.989
Oh, my gosh, Steve!

23:25.990 --> 23:27.989
What!

23:27.990 --> 23:30.989
No!

23:30.989 --> 23:33.409
It really sucks being evicted
and especially comin coming from

23:33.410 --> 23:33.990
Steve.

23:33.991 --> 23:35.989
I thought Steve and I were on
good terms.

23:35.990 --> 23:36.990
I have so much to tell you.

23:36.991 --> 23:38.990
Let me just show you.

23:41.990 --> 23:42.990
Are you ready?

23:42.991 --> 23:44.989
Oh, my God!

23:44.990 --> 23:44.991
I'm dying.

23:44.991 --> 23:49.989
Julie: In the head butt
video, Jason's shirt had a

23:49.990 --> 23:49.991
collar.

23:49.991 --> 23:52.989
Oh, false.

23:52.990 --> 23:53.990
Julie: True.

23:53.991 --> 23:57.989
Congratulations, Steve, you are
the new head of household.

23:57.990 --> 23:58.990
Oh, Stevie!

23:58.990 --> 23:58.998
Oh, my God.

23:58.999 --> 23:59.990
I know.

23:59.990 --> 24:00.990
I was so happy for him.

24:00.991 --> 24:02.989
You were so excited.

24:02.990 --> 24:03.410
I know.

24:03.411 --> 24:05.989
What were you thinking, I'm
good?

24:05.990 --> 24:09.829
Yeah, I was so excited
because I felt like I was good

24:09.830 --> 24:09.990
with him.

24:09.991 --> 24:13.699
Thi>> this is a game, this is
nothing personal.

24:13.700 --> 24:15.989
Meg and Jackie, I'm sorry.

24:15.990 --> 24:17.119
Whoa.

24:17.120 --> 24:17.990
Mind blowing.

24:17.991 --> 24:21.989
Yeah, after everything went
down he grabbed me and pulled me

24:21.990 --> 24:24.989
aside and said the reason was
because when I was h.O.H. I was

24:24.990 --> 24:25.999
going to backdoor him.

24:26.000 --> 24:26.990
No.

24:26.990 --> 24:27.830
Were you?

24:27.831 --> 24:29.989
You were up there with Vanessa.

24:29.990 --> 24:29.991
I know.

24:29.991 --> 24:31.989
You know who I was going to
backdoor.

24:31.990 --> 24:33.989
The whole house knows.

24:33.990 --> 24:35.989
Guess who else was going to
backdoor him.

24:35.990 --> 24:36.990
I know.

24:36.990 --> 24:37.990
Everyone was.

24:37.990 --> 24:38.290
Vanessa.

24:38.291 --> 24:39.539
I know.

24:39.540 --> 24:41.989
You all were on the same plan.

24:41.990 --> 24:44.989
She's brilliant and says that
was your plan when it was hers,

24:44.990 --> 24:44.991
also.

24:44.991 --> 24:45.990
I know, I know.

24:45.991 --> 24:51.989
Julie: By a vote of 6-1,
Jackie, you are evicted from the

24:51.990 --> 24:53.989
"Big Brother" house.

24:53.990 --> 24:55.829
Oh, honey.

24:55.830 --> 24:58.989
As much as I would like to
blame Steve for getting me

24:58.990 --> 25:02.699
evicted, something kind of tells
me there was someone in his ear.

25:02.700 --> 25:04.989
If she couldn't get Becky,
she was going to get you.

25:04.990 --> 25:07.699
I do hope that Vanessa is
next to leave, but a little part

25:07.700 --> 25:10.289
of me is kind of hoping they
will get back in the game and

25:10.290 --> 25:12.989
that she is still there and I
will personally do it myself.

25:12.990 --> 25:13.990
I never trusted her.

25:13.991 --> 25:15.989
Oh, my God.

25:15.990 --> 25:16.990
Jackie, that was all her game.

25:16.990 --> 25:17.990
Oh, I know.

25:17.990 --> 25:18.990
I know.

25:18.991 --> 25:21.989
Brilliant game play, so, I
mean, bravo to Vanessa.

25:21.990 --> 25:25.539
But if they want any chance of
winning this game, they gotta

25:25.540 --> 25:26.290
get her out.

25:26.291 --> 25:27.989
She's going to keep doing it.

25:27.990 --> 25:31.989
The whole house knows to get
her out next, so we'll see.

25:31.990 --> 25:34.989
Julie: Tonight, either
Becky or Johnny Mac will become

25:34.990 --> 25:36.829
the third member of the jury.

25:36.830 --> 25:41.989
So who will be joining Shelli
and Jackie in the jury house?

25:41.990 --> 25:44.829
Let's return to the living room
and find out.

25:44.830 --> 25:46.989
Houseguests, it's time for the
live vote to begin.

25:46.990 --> 25:50.989
Becky, John, in just moments,
your housemates will cast their

25:50.990 --> 25:51.990
votes to evict live.

25:51.991 --> 25:54.989
But before they do, you each
have a final chance to sway

25:54.990 --> 25:59.539
their votes with one brief
statement.

25:59.540 --> 26:01.829
Becky, you're first.

26:01.830 --> 26:06.989
Well, first, and foremost, a
big Happy Birthday to my sister

26:06.990 --> 26:06.991
back home.

26:06.991 --> 26:09.989
And amongst you houseguests,
it's day 64.

26:09.990 --> 26:12.989
We have lost our minds and it
couldn't be more fun.

26:12.990 --> 26:14.989
I've had an incredible week.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.989
But, also, a great journey and I
don't at the present time to end

26:17.990 --> 26:20.989
today so police plooez do what's
best for your game but I would

26:20.990 --> 26:23.989
love it if it happened to
involve keeping me here.

26:23.990 --> 26:23.991
Thank you.

26:23.991 --> 26:26.989
Julie: Thank you, Becky.

26:26.990 --> 26:27.990
John, it's your turn.

26:27.991 --> 26:34.829
All right, everyone, this
girl does nails, highlights

26:34.830 --> 26:41.539
hair, cleans, and cooks like a
machine, does amazing fruit bowl

26:41.540 --> 26:44.989
arrangements, and I do none of
those things, so keeping me here

26:44.990 --> 26:47.989
would probably be really,
really, really, really dumb, but

26:47.990 --> 26:49.989
I want to stay.

26:49.990 --> 26:51.989
So I'd appreciate your vote.

26:51.990 --> 26:51.991
Thanks.

26:51.991 --> 26:55.989
( Laughter )
>> Julie: Wow.

26:55.990 --> 26:56.990
That was original.

26:56.990 --> 26:57.990
Thanks, John.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.119
Thank you, both.

26:59.120 --> 27:03.539
All right, everyone, it's time
for the live vote to begin.

27:03.540 --> 27:05.119
Neither nominee is allowed to
vote.

27:05.120 --> 27:08.989
Liz, you will only vote in the
event of a tie.

27:08.990 --> 27:13.989
One at a time, the rest of you
will enter the diary room and

27:13.990 --> 27:15.949
cast your vote to evict.

27:15.950 --> 27:16.989
Steve, you're up first tonight.

27:16.990 --> 27:23.989
Please go to the diary room.

27:23.990 --> 27:25.989
Steve and Johnny Mac made a deal
this week.

27:25.990 --> 27:29.409
Is it in his best interest to
keep it?

27:29.410 --> 27:29.990
Hi, Steve.

27:29.991 --> 27:31.989
Hi, Julie.

27:31.990 --> 27:34.989
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

27:34.990 --> 27:36.989
I vote to evict Becky.

27:36.990 --> 27:37.990
Julie: Thank you.

27:37.991 --> 27:39.989
Thanks, Julie.

27:39.990 --> 27:42.989
Julie: Vanessa has been
gunning for Becky since she put

27:42.990 --> 27:46.989
her on the block, but she's had
her run-ins with Johnny Mac as

27:46.990 --> 27:47.990
well.

27:47.990 --> 27:48.990
Hi, Vanessa.

27:48.990 --> 27:49.990
Hi, Julie.

27:49.991 --> 27:51.989
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

27:51.990 --> 27:54.989
I vote to evict Becky.

27:54.990 --> 27:57.989
Julie: Thank you.

27:57.990 --> 27:59.989
Meg has to choose between two
allies.

27:59.990 --> 28:04.989
What's best for her game?

28:04.990 --> 28:05.120
Hi, Meg.

28:05.121 --> 28:06.989
Hey, Julie.

28:06.990 --> 28:07.990
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

28:07.991 --> 28:10.989
I vote to evict Becky.

28:10.990 --> 28:11.990
Julie: Thank you.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.989
Thanks!

28:13.990 --> 28:17.989
Julie: Austin and the twins
have a big decision this week.

28:17.990 --> 28:22.989
Who do they want to keep in the
house to help take Vanessa down?

28:22.990 --> 28:23.700
Hi, Austin.

28:23.701 --> 28:24.989
Hello, Julie.

28:24.990 --> 28:26.989
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

28:26.990 --> 28:30.989
Even though her breakfast is
made with real fruit, I have to

28:30.990 --> 28:32.989
vote to evict Becky.

28:32.990 --> 28:33.950
Julie: Thank you.

28:33.951 --> 28:34.989
Thank you.

28:34.990 --> 28:35.990
Julie: It's official.

28:35.991 --> 28:39.989
With four votes to evict Becky,
Becky will leave the house

28:39.990 --> 28:39.991
tonight.

28:39.991 --> 28:41.989
Let's see how the other votes
fall.

28:41.990 --> 28:42.830
Hi, Julia.

28:42.831 --> 28:44.989
Hi, Julie.

28:44.990 --> 28:46.289
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.989
I vote to evict Becky.

28:48.990 --> 28:51.989
Julie: Thank you.

28:51.990 --> 28:55.409
James resents Becky for playing
both sides of the house when he

28:55.410 --> 28:55.990
was h.O.H.

28:55.991 --> 28:58.989
Will he repay her with his vote?

28:58.990 --> 28:59.950
Hi, James.

28:59.951 --> 29:00.989
Hey, Julie.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.989
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

29:02.990 --> 29:05.989
I vote to evict Becky.

29:05.990 --> 29:06.120
Julie: Thank you.

29:06.121 --> 29:14.121
Thank you, Julie.

29:18.990 --> 29:22.989
Julie: All of the votes are
in, and Becky's time in the "big

29:22.990 --> 29:24.989
brother" house is over.

29:24.990 --> 29:28.989
When we return, we'll give the
news to the houseguests.

29:28.990 --> 29:31.989
Then, the battle for control of
the house heat up, the live head

29:31.990 --> 29:35.699
of household competition is just
around the corner.

29:35.700 --> 29:37.700
Stay with us.

30:14.990 --> 30:16.119
Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

30:16.120 --> 30:19.989
By a vote of 6-0, the
houseguests have just voted to

30:19.990 --> 30:20.990
evict Becky.

30:20.991 --> 30:23.989
Let's return to the living room
and give the news to the

30:23.990 --> 30:24.990
houseguests.

30:24.991 --> 30:26.989
Houseguests, the votes are in.

30:26.990 --> 30:29.989
When I reveal the vote, the
evicted houseguest will have

30:29.990 --> 30:33.989
just a few moments to say
good-bye, gather his or her

30:33.990 --> 30:36.119
belongings, and walk out the
front door.

30:36.120 --> 30:41.989
By a vote of 6-0, Becky, you are
evicted from the "Big Brother"

30:41.990 --> 30:45.989
house.

30:45.990 --> 30:47.989
Bye.

30:47.990 --> 30:48.990
Good luck.

30:48.991 --> 30:52.989
Bye.

30:52.990 --> 30:52.991
Bye.

30:52.991 --> 30:56.989
Take care.

30:56.990 --> 30:56.991
Bye.

30:56.991 --> 31:04.991
Bye, Becky.

31:08.990 --> 31:16.990
( Applause ) >> Bye, guys.

31:18.990 --> 31:26.990
( Cheers and applause )
>> Hi, Julie.

31:33.990 --> 31:35.989
Oh, wow.

31:35.990 --> 31:38.829
Damn... darn, I mean.

31:38.830 --> 31:43.989
Oh.

31:43.990 --> 31:44.990
Another black and white, man.

31:44.991 --> 31:49.989
Yup.

31:49.990 --> 31:51.990
Final 8, guys.

32:02.540 --> 32:05.409
Julie: Becky, 6-0, unanimous.

32:05.410 --> 32:12.989
Are you surprised?

32:12.990 --> 32:15.289
No, Jackie left a week ago
and John was sitting next to me

32:15.290 --> 32:16.989
so those were my closest.

32:16.990 --> 32:18.989
Julie: Just one week ago
you had h.O.H. And you had all

32:18.990 --> 32:22.999
the power you made it well
known that you wanted Vanessa

32:23.000 --> 32:23.830
gone.

32:23.831 --> 32:25.989
You thought you had the votes to
get rid of her.

32:25.990 --> 32:25.991
Absolutely.

32:25.991 --> 32:28.989
Julie: But your... quote,
unquote... allies turned their

32:28.990 --> 32:31.989
back on you.

32:31.990 --> 32:34.989
That's something I should
have been more aware of.

32:34.990 --> 32:38.829
I thought the way I felt Vanessa
was the way James and Meg felt

32:38.830 --> 32:38.990
about Shelli.

32:38.991 --> 32:43.989
They really saw her as somebody
who jeopardized ther name and

32:43.990 --> 32:46.989
when the votes came down, they
got to pick, Shelli or Vanessa,

32:46.990 --> 32:47.990
and they chose Shelli.

32:47.991 --> 32:51.989
So it should have been something
I was more aware of but I was

32:51.990 --> 32:53.989
very much blinded by Vanessa.

32:53.990 --> 32:56.989
Julie: I have to say, I
applaud the bold move.

32:56.990 --> 33:00.989
You didn't even pretend to give
her the time of day when she was

33:00.990 --> 33:02.989
trying to cut a deal with you.

33:02.990 --> 33:03.990
No.

33:03.991 --> 33:07.829
<i>( Applause ).</i>

33:07.830 --> 33:09.989
Julie: But sitting here
with me now, do you regret

33:09.990 --> 33:14.989
making it so obvious that you
wanted her gone?

33:14.990 --> 33:15.990
Absolutely.

33:15.991 --> 33:18.989
I think more than anything, I
tend to be very direct person.

33:18.990 --> 33:22.989
And I think that can have
positive results and negative.

33:22.990 --> 33:25.989
And I'm very direct and forward
and I was very confident that my

33:25.990 --> 33:27.989
plan was going to go perfect.

33:27.990 --> 33:29.409
I didn't expect the unexpected.

33:29.410 --> 33:30.989
And it turned.

33:30.990 --> 33:32.989
Julie: Do you ret gret
that?

33:32.990 --> 33:33.999
Yes and no.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.989
I guess because it didn't work
out, you look back and you

33:36.990 --> 33:37.990
regret it.

33:37.991 --> 33:40.119
However, if it would have been
that Vanessa walked out that

33:40.120 --> 33:42.989
door and Shelli stayed I would
have thought it was the best

33:42.990 --> 33:46.119
game move that I did and handled
it perfectly.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.989
Julie: Is Vanessa the best
game player in the house right

33:48.990 --> 33:49.120
now?

33:49.121 --> 33:50.989
Logically, yes.

33:50.990 --> 33:52.409
She is so smart.

33:52.410 --> 33:54.119
From... she just gets the bigger
picture.

33:54.120 --> 33:55.989
She gets the game plans on how
things work.

33:55.990 --> 33:58.989
But I wouldn't necessarily say
best.

33:58.990 --> 34:01.999
I think one thing we've seen
this season is a lot of people

34:02.000 --> 34:04.989
that laid low at the beginning
are really the ones coming

34:04.990 --> 34:05.990
together at the end.

34:05.990 --> 34:06.990
So we'll see.

34:06.991 --> 34:10.989
There's a couple... I think
Steve... Steve has some tricks up

34:10.990 --> 34:10.991
his sleeve.

34:10.991 --> 34:12.989
Julie: Don't underestimate
Steve.

34:12.990 --> 34:13.830
I will not.

34:13.831 --> 34:15.989
Julie: In the event that
you were the one, victed

34:15.990 --> 34:18.119
tonight, your housemates taped
some good-bye messages.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.989
Let's watch and listen.

34:20.990 --> 34:25.989
I'm going through so many
feelings right now, so many

34:25.989 --> 34:27.989
But if you're out of the house
I'm really sad because I've lost

34:27.990 --> 34:30.989
my number one Ally in this game.

34:30.990 --> 34:33.409
Hopefully, you're able to fight
your way back in here so we can

34:33.410 --> 34:34.000
take this thing to the end.

34:34.001 --> 34:36.989
Hey, Becky, I'm sorry that
you had to go.

34:36.990 --> 34:39.999
I thought of you as one of the
biggest competitive threats to

34:40.000 --> 34:43.989
me in this game so hopefully you
can see it as a compliment.

34:43.990 --> 34:44.990
Good luck in jury.

34:44.990 --> 34:45.120
Wish you the best.

34:45.121 --> 34:46.989
Hi, Becky.

34:46.990 --> 34:50.989
As a "Big Brother" superman I
love the game you played this

34:50.990 --> 34:53.989
season, you made big moves, won
competitions and contributed a

34:53.990 --> 34:54.990
lot to the the game play.

34:54.991 --> 34:58.989
I wish you the best of luck in
Colorado and I'll see you soon.

34:58.990 --> 35:02.989
Becky oa human level you are
a wonderful girl and I have

35:02.990 --> 35:03.990
nothing bad to say against you.

35:03.991 --> 35:08.539
But on a game level, there's no
secret we're pitted against each

35:08.540 --> 35:08.990
other.

35:08.991 --> 35:11.989
You tried to send me home last
week, so this week, can't say

35:11.990 --> 35:13.989
I'm sorry to see you go.

35:13.990 --> 35:15.829
Fair enough, fair enough.

35:15.830 --> 35:18.989
Julie: If you get the
chance to go back in there, will

35:18.990 --> 35:19.999
you befriend Vanessa?

35:20.000 --> 35:20.990
Yeah.

35:20.991 --> 35:22.989
Julie: Or will you go after
her still.

35:22.990 --> 35:25.949
Yeah, no, I think Vanessa
plays very smart.

35:25.950 --> 35:29.289
She knows when the... if she can
stay in the house longer and it

35:29.290 --> 35:31.989
gives her a benefit, I think she
would work with me again

35:31.990 --> 35:35.949
because, obviously, I think Liz
I didn't see coming.

35:35.950 --> 35:36.000
She's quiet.

35:36.001 --> 35:38.989
She doesn't talk a lot of game.

35:38.990 --> 35:40.989
"Okay, by the way, I'll send you
home now."

35:40.990 --> 35:41.990
I didn't see it coming.

35:41.991 --> 35:45.539
So I would more so go after Liz
if I got back in the house.

35:45.540 --> 35:46.989
Julie: You might get that
chance.

35:46.990 --> 35:47.990
I know.

35:47.991 --> 35:49.989
Julie: But for now, you're
headed to the jury house.

35:49.990 --> 35:50.990
Thank you, Becky.

35:50.991 --> 35:53.539
Thank you.

35:53.540 --> 35:54.949
Julie: Stay right there.

35:54.950 --> 35:59.989
Next week, zingbot will make his
return to zing the houseguests,

35:59.990 --> 36:04.989
but can find him now at his
official Twitter account.

36:04.990 --> 36:08.989
Follow him and he just might
zing you like he has to so many

36:08.990 --> 36:09.290
others before.

36:09.290 --> 36:09.990
Take a look.

36:09.991 --> 36:16.989
Joe, how does it feel to be
the old man of the house?

36:16.990 --> 36:19.119
Oh, sorry, boogie.

36:19.120 --> 36:25.989
I didn't see you there.

36:25.990 --> 36:26.990
Zing!

36:26.991 --> 36:32.989
Danielle, I hear Shane's going
to give you a special gift after

36:32.990 --> 36:39.949
the season... a restraining
order.

36:39.950 --> 36:39.990
Zing!

36:39.991 --> 36:43.989
I hate the zingbot.

36:43.990 --> 36:44.990
Amanda.

36:44.990 --> 36:45.990
Don't worry.

36:45.991 --> 36:50.949
You can visit mccrae in
Minnesota.

36:50.950 --> 36:56.989
Just mail yourself using your
giant tramp stamp.

36:56.990 --> 37:00.989
Oh, no!

37:00.990 --> 37:03.989
What is a tramp stamp, you ask?

37:03.990 --> 37:04.990
A mistake.

37:04.991 --> 37:07.699
That was harsh.

37:07.700 --> 37:10.539
Frankie!

37:10.540 --> 37:17.989
That's a nice tan, but I'm
surprised you get any sun at all

37:17.990 --> 37:25.990
considering how much time you
spend in your sister's shadow.

37:26.990 --> 37:33.539
Ooooh!

37:33.540 --> 37:33.990
Ouch!

37:33.991 --> 37:35.289
You're such a nice guy.

37:35.290 --> 37:41.989
You haven't made any enemies
this summer.

37:41.990 --> 37:45.989
Except for maybe Christine's
husband.

37:45.990 --> 37:47.990
Oh, my God!

38:02.990 --> 38:03.999
Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

38:04.000 --> 38:06.989
It's time to crown a new head of
household, and with everyone

38:06.990 --> 38:09.989
scrambling for safety, this
h.O.H. Competition could be the

38:09.990 --> 38:11.989
biggest battle of the summer.

38:11.990 --> 38:16.989
Let's head the backyard and get
things started.

38:16.990 --> 38:19.989
Liz, as outgoing head of
household, you are not eligible

38:19.990 --> 38:21.949
to compete.

38:21.950 --> 38:24.999
This competition is called
"ready, set, whoa!."

38:25.000 --> 38:30.989
And this h.O.H. Track meet will
be run in six races.

38:30.990 --> 38:34.989
In each race, one houseguest
will be eliminated.

38:34.990 --> 38:38.989
At the start of each race, you
will get on your starter block

38:38.990 --> 38:42.989
and hold down all three buttons.

38:42.990 --> 38:47.989
Each race will begin when the
monitor at the end of the yard

38:47.990 --> 38:53.989
scroalz through the words
"ready," "set," "go."

38:53.990 --> 38:58.989
When you see the word "go," you
must race across the yard and

38:58.990 --> 38:59.990
buzz in.

38:59.991 --> 39:04.989
The houseguest who hits his or
her buzzer last will be

39:04.990 --> 39:08.989
eliminated from this
competition.

39:08.990 --> 39:14.539
But be warned... there are decoy
words that rhyme with the word

39:14.540 --> 39:17.989
"go," and if you release any
button before you see the word

39:17.990 --> 39:23.989
"go," the first person who false
started will be eliminated.

39:23.990 --> 39:30.989
Stay focused because the word
"dp," could appear in just a few

39:30.990 --> 39:35.989
seconds or 30 minutes or
anywhere in between.

39:35.990 --> 39:40.989
After each elimination, you will
reset, and the next race will

39:40.990 --> 39:40.998
begin.

39:40.999 --> 39:41.990
Does everyone understand?

39:41.990 --> 39:42.700
Yeah.

39:42.701 --> 39:45.989
Oh, yes, Julie!

39:45.990 --> 39:46.830
( Laughter ).

39:46.830 --> 39:46.990
Julie: All right, then.

39:46.991 --> 39:50.989
Please take your places on your
starting blocks and get ready

39:50.990 --> 39:56.990
and wait for your first race.

40:04.990 --> 40:06.989
Vanessa, please press your foot.

40:06.990 --> 40:14.990
That is the third button,
everyone.

40:21.000 --> 40:25.989
I like crows.

40:25.990 --> 40:32.989
Not me.

40:32.990 --> 40:34.989
Oh!

40:34.990 --> 40:42.990
Come on!

41:04.990 --> 41:05.990
That's a good one.

41:05.991 --> 41:10.989
Go!

41:10.990 --> 41:12.989
Oh, what a surprise.

41:12.990 --> 41:13.990
Julie: Sorry, Meg, you
buzzed in laugh.

41:13.990 --> 41:14.990
You've been eliminated.

41:14.991 --> 41:20.989
Everyone stretch it out, shake
it off, your next race will
begin.

41:20.990 --> 41:24.409
Julie: Up next, I have big
news about next week's live
eviction.

41:24.410 --> 41:26.410
Stay with us.

41:39.990 --> 41:41.989
Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

41:41.990 --> 41:44.989

competition, and Thursday for

41:51.990 --> 41:52.990
the next live eviction.

41:52.991 --> 41:54.989
But that's not all.

41:54.990 --> 41:56.989
During next Thursday's live
show, the current jurors will

41:56.990 --> 42:01.989

game.

42:01.990 --> 42:05.539
