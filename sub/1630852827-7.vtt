WEBVTT

00:20.160 --> 00:21.160
Next step.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.400
Dammit, I can't even
take a bath in peace.

00:37.520 --> 00:40.520
Isabel Mora. They pulled her
off the train tracks.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.040
What? She threw herself
onto the tracks?

00:43.040 --> 00:43.120
What? She threw herself
onto the tracks?
We don't know, a guy
who was on the train called.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.920
We don't know, a guy
who was on the train called.

01:25.840 --> 01:28.040
Isabel Mora was just admitted.
Can you...

01:28.160 --> 01:30.480
Yes. Patient information
is down there.

01:36.040 --> 01:37.760
Excuse me.

01:37.960 --> 01:40.000
-I want to ask...
-Wait your turn.

01:40.000 --> 01:40.080
-I want to ask...
-Wait your turn.
We'll get to you.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.120
We'll get to you.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.760
Just a quick question,
it's not complicated.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.320
I just want a quick answer.

01:45.520 --> 01:47.160
So does everybody else here.

01:47.680 --> 01:50.040
Sorry.
She's waiting for test results.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.800
Don't you worry.

02:17.440 --> 02:18.440
Andrea.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.160
You smell of whiskey.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.400
This is all my fault.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.040
You don't know my daughter.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.480
What you see is...

02:43.240 --> 02:44.920
the tip of the iceberg.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.160
The rest is under the surface.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
I'm the one
who didn't see the signs.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.880
I didn't want to.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.320
What signs?

03:05.400 --> 03:07.000
She tried to do this before.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.480
When she was a kid.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.160
Just after...

03:15.880 --> 03:17.120
she was raped.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.080
I pulled her from the water.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.320
I don't know
where I found the strength.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.000
She threw herself in the water

03:28.000 --> 03:28.040
She threw herself in the water
with two bags
of rocks tied to her.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.120
with two bags
of rocks tied to her.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.360
She was determined
to kill herself.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.160
When she wants to do something,
she does it.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.280
The car.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.120
The lake. She...

03:47.200 --> 03:48.360
She didn't crash.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.960
-She meant to do it.
-What lake? What car?

03:53.160 --> 03:54.640
She told me...

03:55.160 --> 03:56.160
It doesn't matter.

03:58.040 --> 04:00.520
She told me...
She came off the road.

04:01.240 --> 04:04.600
Wait, my daughter drove her car
into a lake?

04:07.280 --> 04:08.280
But...

04:09.080 --> 04:12.360
-But, why didn't you tell me?
-Because...

04:13.680 --> 04:14.800
I believed her.

04:21.960 --> 04:23.000
Enough.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.000
Enough with the blame.

04:31.080 --> 04:32.000
My daughter's sick.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.360
And I have to do something.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.800
-I want to see her.
-You can't. She's resting.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.040
She...

04:41.360 --> 04:44.000
She has a clot
in her head from the fall.

04:44.520 --> 04:46.080
-Go home.
-No.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.920
I'm not moving
till I can talk to her.

04:59.680 --> 05:02.240
She's lucky the train
didn't rip her legs off.

05:03.080 --> 05:05.760
You're lucky she didn't leave
a note blaming you.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.120
Me? How am I to blame?

05:09.240 --> 05:11.040
I'm not responsible
for the actions

05:11.160 --> 05:13.040
of every person I report on.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.120
The witnesses.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.800
-Ready?
-Yes, they're here.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.040
Come on, then.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.080
Anyway, you have
to move the hell on.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.760
She was raped and it's awful,

05:27.920 --> 05:29.920
I'm the first
to put myself in her shoes,

05:30.080 --> 05:33.080
but damn, get over it
and if you can't, quit the case.

05:33.800 --> 05:37.160
Don't go around screwing up
people's lives. Right.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.320
We're in the exact spot
where Officer Isabel Mora

05:44.480 --> 05:47.040
almost lost her life
beneath the wheels of a train.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.840
It was here, on these tracks,

05:49.000 --> 05:52.160
where she fell just seconds
before the train pulled in.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.680
Incredibly,
she was to be given

05:54.840 --> 05:56.400
a second chance at life.

05:56.560 --> 05:58.400
We're here
with some of the witnesses.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.480
Did you see her fall
onto the tracks?

06:01.640 --> 06:03.680
No, I'd just arrived
at the station

06:03.800 --> 06:05.800
and I saw a bulge
on the lines.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.080
Thank God
that guy jumped down.

06:07.240 --> 06:08.760
Otherwise, she'd be dead.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.840
He risked his own life
to save her.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.000
According to eyewitness
reports,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.560
a man saved Officer Mora,
last night.

06:16.880 --> 06:20.320
He was the last person Isabel
Mora would have expected

06:20.440 --> 06:22.040
to risk his life for her.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.280
In a remarkable
turn of events,

06:23.400 --> 06:24.480
we've just been told

06:24.640 --> 06:28.040
the person who stopped her
from being run over by a train

06:28.800 --> 06:30.000
was Julián López de Haro.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.040
Hello?

07:16.240 --> 07:19.040
-Let the porter know...
-Is anyone there?

07:22.000 --> 07:25.120
-You shouldn't move, lie down.
-No, I'm fine.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.000
I don't want to lie down.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.120
She needs to rest.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.480
Yes, just one moment, please.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.880
Make sure her breathing stable.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.200
-Call if you need me.
-I am here you know.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.160
Thank you.

07:40.760 --> 07:41.880
How are you, honey?

07:43.640 --> 07:45.080
Are you thirsty?
Do you want some water?

07:45.240 --> 07:46.240
No.

07:46.960 --> 07:47.960
No.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.200
I want to leave.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.080
No, you have to remain
under observation.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.040
You have a...

07:55.200 --> 07:57.720
a small clot in your head.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.400
From when you...

08:02.560 --> 08:04.000
fell onto the tracks.

08:04.600 --> 08:05.680
You think I jumped?

08:09.120 --> 08:10.760
We don't need
to talk about it now.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.640
-What matters is you're okay.
-I didn't jump.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.760
I like my life.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.040
I like it.
And I love my daughter.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.200
I want to be here.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.560
And I love you.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.960
What about the car in the lake?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.280
He told you.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.480
-I was dizzy and came off...
-And the nude photo?

08:40.160 --> 08:41.160
And the LSD?

08:42.640 --> 08:43.640
The shooting?

08:46.120 --> 08:47.160
Don't you see?

08:49.120 --> 08:50.360
You're self-destructing.

08:51.920 --> 08:55.040
You can't keep denying it
over and over.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.200
I'm a psychiatrist.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.080
I know what despair can lead to.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.360
Mom, I don't want to die.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.000
-Then prove it.
-I can't.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.920
I wish I could but I can't.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.320
I can't prove anything,
none of it.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.080
But...

09:16.880 --> 09:19.000
you can believe
what I'm telling you.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.160
You need help.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.080
Or one day,
you'll have nobody left.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.000
Not me, not Nieto, not...

09:31.800 --> 09:33.640
I don't know
why this is happening.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.320
I don't get it.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.080
Or how it's happening.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.360
Mom.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.880
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.440
Grandma told me...

09:47.920 --> 09:48.920
that you fell.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.640
-Hello?
-How is she?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.880
I haven't spoken to her yet.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
It'll have to wait.
Someone else is dead.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.600
No, I can't leave now.

10:08.320 --> 10:09.320
Yes, you can.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.760
You're the lead inspector
on this case.

10:11.880 --> 10:14.040
Call Abaño and Perea
for the address.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.560
Damn.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.200
How did we sleep?

11:00.280 --> 11:01.920
-Fine.
-Glad to hear it.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.720
Because you're going
to help me today.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.440
It's not all...

11:25.880 --> 11:27.000
You've lost a nail.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.720
You're not eating well.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.400
I need you fit and well
for what's coming.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.520
What's coming?

11:39.160 --> 11:40.200
The grand finale.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.280
Let me go, please.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.040
How many more times?

11:47.240 --> 11:49.000
Tell me why you have me here,
now!

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Don't shout at me.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.120
I never had a dog as a kid.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.240
Or any friends.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.520
I'm not your dog or your friend.

12:06.280 --> 12:07.360
Here we go again.

12:10.880 --> 12:11.880
Choose a suit.

12:13.960 --> 12:14.960
I don't get it.

12:16.640 --> 12:19.600
I'm making a public appearance
and I'd like to appeal

12:19.760 --> 12:21.280
to a lot of people like you...

12:22.160 --> 12:23.240
easy to govern.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.000
What's that got to do with me?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.080
Come on... choose a suit.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.920
"Traumatic brain injury."

13:25.280 --> 13:27.720
-How's Isabel?
-Fine. Who's the deceased?

13:28.680 --> 13:30.040
The car trunk kidnapper.

13:30.040 --> 13:30.080
The car trunk kidnapper.
They hit him with the car.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.960
They hit him with the car.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.960
The same card as always.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.640
He abducted five girls.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.920
It was a huge case.

13:38.080 --> 13:41.040
He followed them in his car
till they got somewhere quiet

13:41.040 --> 13:41.080
He followed them in his car
till they got somewhere quiet
then he'd attack them,
put them in the trunk

13:41.080 --> 13:43.360
then he'd attack them,
put them in the trunk

13:43.520 --> 13:45.400
-and kidnap them.
-Yes, I remember.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.240
Anything to go on?

13:47.400 --> 13:51.840
Well, let's see if we can lift
anything from the car

13:51.960 --> 13:53.680
that points to the monkey.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.520
Forensics
are collecting samples.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.960
-Let's see if we get lucky...
-Hello?

13:58.320 --> 13:59.560
She's taken off.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.000
She's escaped
from the hospital.

14:03.520 --> 14:04.520
Did anyone see her go?

14:16.120 --> 14:17.120
Nieto!

14:18.600 --> 14:19.600
Nieto!

14:21.760 --> 14:23.720
I just want to apologize.

14:32.320 --> 14:33.720
I just want to apologize.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.160
I just want to apologize.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.040
-Hello?
-Mr. Haro?

15:10.040 --> 15:10.080
-Hello?
-Mr. Haro?
It's the producer's driver.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.600
It's the producer's driver.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.120
-I'm on my way.
-Good.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.160
The external gate will be open.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.840
Son of a bitch.
You had to do this now.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.800
Right when I need to be calm.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.240
Relaxed.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.760
Nobody changes my goddamn plan.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.280
Just a minute,
I'll be right out!

16:39.280 --> 16:40.280
Dammit.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.320
Sorry about the wait. Let's go.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.560
Thanks.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.080
-Has Nieto called?
-Not yet,

17:45.240 --> 17:47.040
but I've sent him an update.

17:47.040 --> 17:47.120
but I've sent him an update.
Back to it. Anything?

17:47.120 --> 17:48.760
Back to it. Anything?

17:49.200 --> 17:50.200
-Nothing.
-Right.

17:51.960 --> 17:53.000
Perea.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.480
I need some information.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.080
You're suspended Isabel,
you know I can't.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.280
Are you okay?

17:59.400 --> 18:02.640
-Are you in the hospital?
-Yes. I'm fine.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.200
At the butcher shop
crime scene,

18:04.360 --> 18:06.680
when we left,
did anyone else clean up?

18:06.880 --> 18:09.400
I mean,
who took what we left there?

18:12.000 --> 18:14.080
The lady who cleans
the butcher shop.

18:16.920 --> 18:17.920
Okay.

19:03.880 --> 19:04.880
She's not here.

19:11.080 --> 19:14.040
We have to go look for her.
Everywhere.

19:15.120 --> 19:19.480
-We have to think, not panic.
-Sure. That's easy to say.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.280
My daughter is unpredictable.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.480
Where did you go?

19:23.640 --> 19:25.480
The top of a bridge,
ready to jump,

19:25.600 --> 19:27.080
to see if she finally succeeds.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.200
No, there have been no reports.
I'd know.

19:30.280 --> 19:31.800
If you really want
to kill yourself,

19:31.960 --> 19:34.520
you jump out
of the hospital window.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.320
It's easy to be logical

19:39.000 --> 19:41.120
when someone
doesn't matter to you.

19:41.120 --> 19:41.160
when someone
doesn't matter to you.
It's not the time
to discuss feelings.

19:41.160 --> 19:43.040
It's not the time
to discuss feelings.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.640
Especially mine.

20:35.280 --> 20:37.680
I like a natural look,
not too much.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.480
Nothing worse
than looking like a mask, right?

20:45.080 --> 20:46.080
Right?

20:53.800 --> 20:55.640
I know
what you're thinking.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
You despise me.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.440
Yet here you are, serving me.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.720
What did you tell
your mom this morning?

21:04.040 --> 21:05.040
Your friends?

21:05.640 --> 21:07.320
For the 600 euros
you're getting.

21:08.280 --> 21:12.040
Doing a rapist's make-up.
Where are your principles?

21:12.920 --> 21:13.920
Where are they?

21:15.080 --> 21:16.360
In your hateful glances.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.000
You could do everyone a favor

21:19.720 --> 21:21.720
and stick that brush
through my eye.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.240
Blind me.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.800
But no, you won't.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.160
You think you're better
than me.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.080
Enough, that'll do.

21:49.160 --> 21:50.000
Assholes!

21:55.840 --> 21:56.840
Commissioner.

21:58.760 --> 21:59.760
He's in bad shape.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.440
But you don't care, do you?

22:03.440 --> 22:05.520
I need people to search
for Isabel.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.040
-She left the hospital.
-That's enough.

22:08.200 --> 22:09.960
We have to find her.
Something could happen.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.000
-She should be...
-Enough, Nieto.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.240
You think I'm going
to use police resources

22:14.400 --> 22:15.800
on a private matter?

22:16.400 --> 22:18.320
I wouldn't, even
for my own family.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.760
It's how things work.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.560
I know very well
how things work.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.440
I've been a cop
for over 25 years.

22:23.560 --> 22:24.840
I'm asking for a favor.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.600
And the people getting killed
while you're not doing your job?

22:27.760 --> 22:28.760
They have families, too.

22:28.960 --> 22:31.040
Mothers and fathers
who worry about them.

22:31.080 --> 22:33.120
Isabel is one of us.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.560
We don't make distinctions here.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.120
Not everyone is worth the same.

22:38.720 --> 22:41.800
That's the vilest thing
I've heard a cop say in my life.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.720
That's the thing with honesty.

22:44.400 --> 22:45.720
It's always surprising.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.680
What happened to you, Nieto?

22:48.120 --> 22:50.440
You've changed,
you weren't like this.

22:50.600 --> 22:51.560
So have you.

22:54.560 --> 22:55.880
Get back to work.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.000
That's an order.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.360
-Nieto.
-I'm not interested.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.920
-But...
-Leave me alone! You hear me?

23:09.120 --> 23:10.960
Or don't you understand
the words?

23:11.880 --> 23:14.280
Please yourself.
Isabel called, if you care.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.120
Where did she call from?
What did she say?

23:17.240 --> 23:18.400
Maybe I don't know.

23:19.120 --> 23:22.200
-I don't understand the words...
-I'm sorry.

23:23.880 --> 23:24.920
Where is she?

23:42.160 --> 23:44.440
Isabel. Get out of there now.

23:45.240 --> 23:47.920
Hey! It's the snitch!

23:48.080 --> 23:49.400
You left nothing out!

23:49.840 --> 23:52.080
You told my mom down
to the last detail.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.120
Let me put it another way.

23:54.680 --> 23:58.000
You're in no state to be rifling
through all this shit,

23:58.160 --> 23:59.520
whatever it is
you're looking for.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.080
-Please, get out of there.
-When I find the bottle.

24:02.080 --> 24:02.120
-Please, get out of there.
-When I find the bottle.
I'm in no hurry.

24:02.120 --> 24:03.360
I'm in no hurry.

24:03.560 --> 24:06.800
The advantages of being crazy
and having no job to go to.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.200
What bottle?

24:09.880 --> 24:11.840
The bottle
that was laced with LSD.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.080
Goddammit.

24:24.680 --> 24:25.680
Isn't this great?

24:26.040 --> 24:27.040
The trash...

24:27.520 --> 24:30.080
taking itself out.
Everything in its place.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.720
Things look
pretty bad right now,

24:32.840 --> 24:34.440
but they'll get better.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.760
-Trust me.
-What's your game?

24:37.480 --> 24:39.240
Are you a therapist now?

24:40.120 --> 24:43.040
-My mom has rubbed off on you.
-I did it all for you.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.160
-For you.
-Right...

24:47.520 --> 24:49.000
It must be great for you.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.880
To have a victim in common.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.640
Poor Isabel, poor thing.

24:52.800 --> 24:53.800
Poor little thing.

24:54.200 --> 24:55.200
She's crazy.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.720
That's right, sure.
Freakin' great.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.080
Good idea, sit down.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.680
If the clot doesn't kill you,
an infection will.

25:03.080 --> 25:04.720
What do you want?

25:08.520 --> 25:09.640
Shit.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.920
-Take it easy.
-The bottle.

25:15.320 --> 25:17.280
It's my bottle.
This is my bottle.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.080
-Now what?
-It has water in it.

25:20.080 --> 25:20.120
-Now what?
-It has water in it.
I'll take it to the lab
to get it analyzed.

25:20.120 --> 25:22.680
I'll take it to the lab
to get it analyzed.

25:22.880 --> 25:26.440
To the lab, now? Won't you just
stay still for a minute?

25:26.640 --> 25:27.960
-No.
-What do you want?

25:28.120 --> 25:30.840
To prove I'm telling the truth.
Don't you get it?

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
-To prove what can't be proved.
-We all got the same water

25:34.160 --> 25:37.160
-at the press conference.
-I didn't take LSD, okay?

25:37.440 --> 25:39.320
Again,
with the "I didn't do it."

25:42.800 --> 25:44.040
It's my only chance.

25:48.560 --> 25:51.040
Okay. I'll take care of it.

25:53.640 --> 25:55.600
Go back to the hospital, please.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.960
When you get the results,

26:01.720 --> 26:03.280
bring them to the hospital.

26:13.160 --> 26:14.840
Just let me adjust your mic.

26:21.320 --> 26:22.320
Ready?

26:22.440 --> 26:26.160
Going live in three, two, one...

26:26.320 --> 26:29.600
Good morning.
First of all, I want to say

26:29.720 --> 26:33.000
we've never had so much pressure
to cancel an interview.

26:33.280 --> 26:37.360
My colleagues have criticized
my supposed lack of ethics,

26:37.480 --> 26:40.000
accusing me
of whitewashing a monster.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.920
Are you a monster,
Mr. López de Haro?

26:48.840 --> 26:49.840
I was.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.280
How do you justify what you did?

26:53.480 --> 26:54.840
There's no justification.

26:55.400 --> 26:59.000
Are you aware of how terrible
your past actions were?

27:01.160 --> 27:02.760
I know I destroyed many lives.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.760
I know I'm hated.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.120
And I deserve it.

27:13.960 --> 27:15.040
Are you nervous?

27:16.240 --> 27:18.840
It's not easy to bare your soul
to the world.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.560
It was easier to bare
your victims' bodies.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.200
I was sick.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.680
I don't want this
to be misinterpreted...

27:33.440 --> 27:34.600
it's not an excuse,

27:37.080 --> 27:38.080
but I was sick.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.440
And now you're not?

27:42.080 --> 27:43.120
No.

27:51.320 --> 27:54.320
-How dare you show up here.
-I want to see how you are.

27:54.480 --> 27:55.800
I worry about you, too.

27:56.560 --> 27:58.520
I heard and wanted
to see how you are

27:58.640 --> 28:01.120
-or if you need anything.
-You can't just show up.

28:01.120 --> 28:01.160
-or if you need anything.
-You can't just show up.
Relax, I can help you now.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.800
Relax, I can help you now.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.680
Whatever you need.
Maybe you both need to eat?

28:05.840 --> 28:07.680
Tell me what you like,
I'll get it.

28:07.880 --> 28:10.280
-Who do you think you are?
-An extension of you.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.520
We're one person.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.200
Andrea.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.400
I love you.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.280
That's what I feel for you.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.520
It's not gratitude
or dependence.

28:21.680 --> 28:24.080
-I love you.
-No, enough.

28:24.080 --> 28:24.160
-I love you.
-No, enough.
It's finished.
I want you to forget all of it.

28:24.160 --> 28:27.000
It's finished.
I want you to forget all of it.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.720
Forget we ever even met, and...

28:29.880 --> 28:33.040
anything you might feel for me.
This isn't right.

28:35.320 --> 28:37.680
If you could see me
in a different way...

28:38.400 --> 28:39.880
How would you like me
to see you?

28:40.040 --> 28:42.400
As someone who loves you,
and wants to make you happy.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.920
There aren't many
willing to do what it takes.

28:46.200 --> 28:49.000
You think I'm weak,
but you're wrong.

28:49.880 --> 28:53.000
So, tell me. Who's protecting
and caring for who?

28:53.160 --> 28:54.160
Me, or you, which is it?

28:55.640 --> 28:57.800
You're confusing the nature
of our relationship.

28:57.960 --> 28:59.720
As you say,
we have a relationship,

28:59.840 --> 29:01.760
but it's not the one you think.

29:03.320 --> 29:04.320
I started it.

29:06.560 --> 29:07.560
I'll finish it.

29:11.480 --> 29:12.480
Yeah?

29:17.480 --> 29:19.040
I know you're suffering.

29:20.040 --> 29:22.040
I know you have nobody
to share it with.

29:25.440 --> 29:28.160
You think I need
a shoulder to cry on?

29:30.960 --> 29:32.400
I've always been on my own.

29:35.240 --> 29:36.240
Well, not anymore.

29:39.080 --> 29:41.400
Nighttime in jail
was really tough.

29:43.640 --> 29:45.680
Images would replay
in my head...

29:46.200 --> 29:47.200
over and over.

29:50.960 --> 29:53.440
When you're sick, you don't
realize the pain you cause.

29:54.840 --> 29:55.840
No.

29:57.920 --> 30:00.960
Do you think the people
watching this at home

30:01.120 --> 30:02.160
right now,

30:04.000 --> 30:07.040
could ever forgive you,
understand you,

30:07.320 --> 30:09.000
or feel pity for you?

30:12.080 --> 30:15.560
Last night, you saved one
of your victims from perishing

30:15.720 --> 30:17.400
beneath the wheels of a train.

30:18.040 --> 30:20.640
She was truly fortunate
you risked your life for her.

30:21.280 --> 30:24.560
I understand it was a matter
of seconds, if I'm not mistaken,

30:24.680 --> 30:26.040
before certain death.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.160
Do you feel better?

30:30.480 --> 30:33.280
That this has gone some way
in repairing what you did?

30:33.440 --> 30:35.000
No, never.

30:35.000 --> 30:35.080
No, never.
-Sir, the car's ready.
-Why were you there?

30:35.080 --> 30:37.440
-Sir, the car's ready.
-Why were you there?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.440
Was it fate?

30:40.280 --> 30:41.400
No.

30:41.560 --> 30:44.400
Fate has nothing to do
with the actions of men.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.480
I ran into her not long ago...

30:49.320 --> 30:52.080
-Are you alright?
-Put the trip on hold.

30:53.760 --> 30:56.160
-We're going to see my lawyer.
-Yes, sir.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.640
We stared at each other...

31:02.600 --> 31:05.120
It was as if she were looking
at the most...

31:09.720 --> 31:11.000
She ran away.

31:11.640 --> 31:14.040
I just wanted to talk to her
and apologize.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.960
I feel the need to apologize.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.120
To all of them.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.640
I have since I got out,
I just didn't know how.

31:27.760 --> 31:30.280
I know things will never be
the same for them.

31:30.400 --> 31:33.120
I understand the contempt
and disgust they have for me,

31:33.120 --> 31:33.160
I understand the contempt
and disgust they have for me,
because I felt it too.

31:33.160 --> 31:34.360
because I felt it too.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.160
I wanted to die.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.200
Many times. But, I'm sorry.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.160
And I'll never stop saying it.
Never.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Forgive me.

31:48.160 --> 31:49.160
Please.

31:51.320 --> 31:54.160
-Forgive me.
-What are you watching that for?

31:54.920 --> 31:55.960
He saved me?

31:56.840 --> 32:00.360
What's this? Why the hell
was he at the station?

32:00.880 --> 32:02.040
Why was he there?

32:03.640 --> 32:06.120
"I wanted to say sorry",
he said so in the interview.

32:07.440 --> 32:10.160
What if he pushed me?
I didn't jump.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.240
Isabel, the witnesses saw you
on the tracks.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.920
They didn't see anyone push you.

32:16.120 --> 32:17.520
-He arrived afterwards...
-Mom!

32:17.680 --> 32:19.000
He pulled you up.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.160
I need to tell you something.

32:31.040 --> 32:32.680
It's important.

32:33.840 --> 32:36.160
So I need you
to listen to me carefully,

32:36.320 --> 32:37.520
before saying no.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.920
That look again.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.160
Yes, again.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.120
It's called concern.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.680
I've been speaking to...

32:55.160 --> 32:57.520
-a therapist I know.
-No.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.240
No.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.000
He told me about a place.

33:03.280 --> 33:06.680
Somewhere
you can take a break.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.880
A few weeks' rest.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.360
In a calm environment.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.000
Away from the outside world.

33:16.960 --> 33:19.160
-Away from the outside world?
-Yes.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.000
Somewhere nothing can upset you.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.760
It's a psychological retreat.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.440
I won't check in
to a psychiatric hospital.

33:28.560 --> 33:29.960
It's not a hospital.

33:31.760 --> 33:34.080
It's a comprehensive
care center.

33:35.400 --> 33:38.560
With different therapies
and activities...

33:38.720 --> 33:40.160
Right.

33:40.160 --> 33:41.680
Call it what you like.

33:43.160 --> 33:44.280
It's an insane asylum.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.040
You're off the Parot case.

33:52.080 --> 33:54.280
-What?
-Another inspector's taking it.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.840
But... Hang on a minute.

33:56.960 --> 33:59.000
You can't. I've never been
kicked off a case.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.520
The decision's been made.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.640
What do you mean it's been made?

34:02.840 --> 34:04.760
-What way is this...?
-A professional one.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.760
I did my job, I tried to find
whoever is killing those...

34:07.880 --> 34:10.600
Say it. Go on, say it.

34:10.760 --> 34:12.080
Those criminals.

34:12.960 --> 34:15.600
That's why you can't find him,
because you don't care.

34:15.800 --> 34:18.000
You've been against it
since I put you on the case.

34:18.000 --> 34:18.080
You've been against it
since I put you on the case.
That doesn't mean
I don't do my duty.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.960
That doesn't mean
I don't do my duty.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.400
-Doesn't it?
-I was trying to find Isabel!

34:22.920 --> 34:25.120
Something you couldn't
care less about.

34:25.240 --> 34:27.080
All you care about
is brown-nosing.

34:27.240 --> 34:28.960
That's how you got
to where you are.

34:30.040 --> 34:32.560
I won't defend myself
against such a vile accusation,

34:32.720 --> 34:34.240
it would be a waste of time.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.040
This conversation is over.

34:40.880 --> 34:41.880
Nieto.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.680
H2O. Nothing but water.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.360
I'm sorry.

35:02.560 --> 35:03.560
Hello.

35:04.080 --> 35:05.080
Hello.

35:05.560 --> 35:06.640
I saw you on TV.

35:07.160 --> 35:08.160
Yes.

35:08.640 --> 35:09.640
It wasn't easy.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.040
Thanks for saving my mom.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.040
How is she?

35:18.200 --> 35:19.200
Not good.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.360
My grandma wants to take her
to a retreat in the mountains.

35:26.920 --> 35:28.240
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.480
And...

35:34.040 --> 35:35.560
will she be gone a long time?

35:37.120 --> 35:40.160
I don't know, about a month.
Maybe more.

35:42.080 --> 35:43.960
They were arguing
about it, so...

35:45.440 --> 35:46.400
Well.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.640
We have to adapt to change.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.120
And make the most of it.

35:52.040 --> 35:53.440
Trust me, I'm an expert.

35:55.760 --> 35:58.200
Maybe asking you to trust me
is a bit optimistic.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.560
Right? We'll take it slow.

36:02.400 --> 36:05.200
-My mom's acting weird.
-Who isn't these days?

36:06.680 --> 36:08.080
We live in a crazy world.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.240
Yeah.

36:13.480 --> 36:15.600
It's amazing
how much you look like me.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.680
Light-colored eyes,

36:21.840 --> 36:22.840
-fair hair.
-No.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.160
I look like my mom.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.120
Of course, I haven't forgotten.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.120
Do you want to come in?
We're drenched.

36:33.120 --> 36:33.160
Do you want to come in?
We're drenched.
-No. I have to go.
-Of course.

36:33.160 --> 36:35.760
-No. I have to go.
-Of course.

36:50.040 --> 36:51.920
What a waste of sperm.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
You look better.

37:07.720 --> 37:08.800
I am.

37:13.960 --> 37:16.360
Are those the results?
Give them here.

37:18.720 --> 37:19.960
They didn't find anything.

37:20.960 --> 37:21.960
That's impossible.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
How did they do it?

37:25.080 --> 37:28.120
-Where did you take it?
-It's conclusive. I'm sorry.

37:28.320 --> 37:31.040
We'll have to do them again
at a different lab.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.920
-They're the police labs.
-Yes, I can see that.

37:34.880 --> 37:38.000
-And you're still not convinced?
-I don't trust anyone lately.

37:39.120 --> 37:43.000
That's called paranoia.
This is getting ridiculous.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.400
You can't see the truth,
you refuse to.

37:49.440 --> 37:50.440
What's the truth?

37:51.200 --> 37:54.000
You're the one doing all this.
It's been you all along.

37:54.600 --> 37:57.760
You had a nervous breakdown
when your rapist was released.

37:57.920 --> 37:58.960
Yes, it's unfair.

37:59.080 --> 38:01.640
And he just happened
to be there to save me.

38:01.800 --> 38:04.600
Weird, isn't it?
Do you know what I think, Nieto?

38:06.200 --> 38:08.080
It was him who pushed me.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.240
-Here we go.
-Why was he there?

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
-At the station?
-That doesn't hold up,

38:15.000 --> 38:15.040
-At the station?
-That doesn't hold up,
there's no way it would
before a judge.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.080
there's no way it would
before a judge.

38:17.240 --> 38:20.080
-He nearly got killed himself.
-Poor thing.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.520
He may be a scumbag
but he saved your life.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.080
That's the truth.

38:31.760 --> 38:33.120
You can't go on like this.

38:36.640 --> 38:39.120
Your mom told me
about a place...

38:39.800 --> 38:42.320
If you're going to start,
go and do not come back.

38:47.480 --> 38:48.920
Give my regards to Ana.

39:03.280 --> 39:05.120
I told you not to come back.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.480
This is the first time
I've come.

39:07.640 --> 39:10.160
-Sorry, sir.
-I guess it wasn't aimed at me.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.840
-No.
-I brought you something.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.120
Thank you.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.640
I know I should have come
sooner but...

39:17.760 --> 39:20.080
I didn't have a clue
what to say to you.

39:20.080 --> 39:20.160
I didn't have a clue
what to say to you.
Right. It's natural.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.520
Right. It's natural.

39:24.080 --> 39:25.520
I wouldn't know either.

39:26.480 --> 39:29.520
Isabel, I... have seen it
all in my career.

39:30.680 --> 39:32.200
When I'd been a cop
for just a month,

39:33.840 --> 39:35.280
the partner they put me with

39:37.720 --> 39:40.120
shot himself
right in front of me. Well.

39:40.560 --> 39:43.320
Post-traumatic stress.
That's how I started.

39:44.880 --> 39:48.120
And I had
to go tell his mother.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.560
The poor woman
could only ask why.

39:52.120 --> 39:55.000
And all I could tell her
was post-traumatic stress,

39:55.160 --> 39:57.520
as if that would help at all.

40:00.640 --> 40:01.920
What I'm saying is...

40:03.120 --> 40:04.920
our minds can be a real bitch.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.160
They push you to the limit.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Right.

40:14.360 --> 40:17.040
With things as they are,
I guess I'm hardly...

40:17.600 --> 40:19.640
in a position
to make accusations.

40:20.600 --> 40:22.040
Accusations of what?

40:23.920 --> 40:27.560
We work based on facts, proof,
on the things we do.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.920
And you, right now, Isabel...

40:32.120 --> 40:33.840
you've hit rock bottom.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.000
I don't want to lose my job.

40:37.120 --> 40:38.640
I know I'm good at what I do.

40:40.120 --> 40:41.160
Even if, lately,...

40:42.080 --> 40:43.880
everything I do says otherwise.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.520
Then I won't sugar-coat it.

40:47.800 --> 40:48.800
No.

40:50.440 --> 40:51.480
It doesn't look good.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.840
Nobody wants to arm
an unstable person.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.120
We've got work to do.

41:20.840 --> 41:22.000
She's pretty, right?

41:23.120 --> 41:24.160
She still is.

41:25.240 --> 41:26.560
Despite everything.

41:27.280 --> 41:28.640
Bags under her eyes.

41:30.680 --> 41:31.760
She can't sleep.

41:33.320 --> 41:34.720
Her life's gone downhill.

41:36.440 --> 41:39.280
Don't get excited,
she's not for your pleasure.

41:41.160 --> 41:42.520
She's no good for that.

41:44.240 --> 41:45.880
She's a tease.

41:48.160 --> 41:49.560
More trouble than she's worth.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.240
Ever met a woman like that?

41:56.120 --> 41:57.920
You have to enunciate better.

42:10.840 --> 42:12.080
I was asking...

42:12.800 --> 42:15.400
-if she was your girlfriend.
-That's a question.

42:15.520 --> 42:16.960
Not the answer.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.520
I shouldn't have taken
the tape off.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.200
A job well done

42:35.000 --> 42:36.160
yields rewards.

42:38.920 --> 42:39.920
Isn't that right?

42:41.920 --> 42:45.320
It's loose ends
that ruin our lives.

42:47.960 --> 42:48.960
It's like...

42:49.920 --> 42:51.680
that little thread hanging

42:52.520 --> 42:53.520
from a nice suit.

42:54.800 --> 42:56.520
No matter
how expensive the suit is,

42:56.720 --> 42:58.320
that hanging thread
ruins everything.

43:00.600 --> 43:01.760
You have to pull it.

43:04.040 --> 43:05.120
Moving on.

43:06.840 --> 43:08.400
Actions have consequences.

43:12.480 --> 43:13.480
For everyone.

43:20.720 --> 43:23.720
-I'll leave the lamps on.
-What's she got to do with me?

43:44.040 --> 43:45.080
Come on out.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.880
Stop looking at me
like I'm some wild animal.

43:51.320 --> 43:53.760
I didn't make a sound.
You're unbelievable.

43:54.480 --> 43:55.480
Question.

43:56.520 --> 43:58.720
How many panties
do you take to a retreat?

44:01.080 --> 44:02.080
What?

44:04.320 --> 44:05.400
Mom...

44:06.920 --> 44:08.320
Why did you have me?

44:09.760 --> 44:11.080
What do you mean?

44:13.720 --> 44:15.040
What kind of a question is that?

44:17.120 --> 44:18.160
I know who my father is.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.560
Don't go anywhere near him.

44:31.560 --> 44:33.040
Why didn't you get an abortion?

44:34.440 --> 44:37.000
It must have been horrible,
watching me grow.

44:37.160 --> 44:39.040
I'd remind you of him
every day and...

44:40.040 --> 44:42.240
-I have his eyes.
-You have nothing of his.

44:44.080 --> 44:46.920
I bet you regretted it
whenever you'd look at me.

44:47.120 --> 44:49.640
I have never in my life
regretted having you.

44:56.880 --> 44:59.720
When I got pregnant with you,
I told your grandma

45:01.040 --> 45:04.440
and she made an appointment
for me to get an abortion,

45:05.480 --> 45:08.520
because I wanted nothing to do
with what was inside of me.

45:09.600 --> 45:12.640
In fact, I didn't want anything.
To be honest...

45:15.040 --> 45:18.560
Nothing mattered to me.
I lived like I was already dead.

45:19.120 --> 45:21.000
Devoid of attachment.

45:22.840 --> 45:24.720
But I didn't go to
the appointment,

45:24.920 --> 45:27.240
because I didn't want anyone
to touch me.

45:28.200 --> 45:29.680
And your grandma was...

45:30.520 --> 45:31.520
beside herself.

45:32.520 --> 45:34.160
But, she couldn't force me.

45:35.160 --> 45:38.000
And... one day I was in bed,

45:38.920 --> 45:41.000
a day which dragged on forever,

45:42.000 --> 45:45.600
I just laid there all day
blaming myself for everything,

45:46.480 --> 45:49.960
and I decided I just didn't care
what came out of me either.

45:51.720 --> 45:53.040
So, I told Grandma.

45:53.680 --> 45:57.280
I wanted to have it,
I wanted to have the baby...

45:57.440 --> 45:58.880
-Come on.
-That's it, push.

45:59.040 --> 46:01.200
That's it, good. Great.

46:01.680 --> 46:03.040
That's it.

46:05.120 --> 46:07.480
That's it. Now relax, breathe.

46:08.440 --> 46:10.960
But I'd give it up
for adoption and I...

46:11.680 --> 46:14.000
didn't care if it was
a boy or a girl.

46:14.160 --> 46:15.360
That's it.

46:16.640 --> 46:18.040
You did it.

46:18.160 --> 46:19.240
It's over.

46:19.400 --> 46:21.440
-Bring it to me.
-No, it's not a good idea.

46:21.600 --> 46:23.080
-Let me see it.
-No, honey.

46:23.080 --> 46:23.120
-Let me see it.
-No, honey.
-No, you shouldn't see it.
-Is it a boy or girl?

46:23.120 --> 46:26.360
-No, you shouldn't see it.
-Is it a boy or girl?

46:27.200 --> 46:28.200
It's a girl.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.040
Give her to me.

46:30.920 --> 46:31.920
Give her to me.

46:40.720 --> 46:41.760
And when I saw you...

46:44.040 --> 46:45.640
everything in me changed.

46:48.320 --> 46:50.800
When I saw you, it was as if...

46:53.040 --> 46:56.080
nothing that had happened
to me mattered,

46:56.480 --> 46:57.480
because thanks...

46:58.280 --> 47:00.480
to what had happened,
you were there.

47:01.120 --> 47:02.120
You were my life.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
And I wanted to be alive.

47:05.960 --> 47:07.120
And I'm sorry...

47:08.560 --> 47:10.720
if I'm a shitty mom sometimes,

47:11.960 --> 47:12.960
and if at times...

47:14.960 --> 47:16.080
I don't do a better job.

47:17.080 --> 47:20.840
But I love you so much
and I want you to know...

47:22.480 --> 47:26.000
you're the most beautiful thing
ever to have happened to me.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.320
I don't want you to forget it.

47:32.320 --> 47:34.240
I'm going to miss you so much.

47:50.160 --> 47:51.200
But I'm sorry.

47:53.080 --> 47:56.040
And I'll never stop saying it.
Never.

47:57.560 --> 48:00.480
And the Oscar goes to...

48:00.640 --> 48:01.640
Forgive me.

Out you come, fluffy monkey.

50:53.080 --> 50:54.240
The time will fly by.

50:56.880 --> 50:58.240

Please, go.
