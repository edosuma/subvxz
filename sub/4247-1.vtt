00:00.633 --> 00:03.235
<i>Joining us now,</i>
<i>the reporter</i>

00:03.237 --> 00:04.503
<i>Who broke this story--</i>
<i>vanessa chandler</i>

00:04.505 --> 00:06.105
Of the "post's" styles section.

00:06.107 --> 00:09.041
<i>Former white house</i>
<i>communications director</i>

00:09.043 --> 00:10.642
<i>Olivia pope.</i>

00:10.644 --> 00:12.644
<i>How sure are you</i>
<i>that she's the woman</i>

00:12.646 --> 00:15.180
<i>Who had an alleged affair</i>
<i>with president grant?</i>

00:15.182 --> 00:17.149
<i>It's just one source,</i>
<i>but it's a good source--</i>

00:17.151 --> 00:19.385
<i>A source in a position</i>
<i>to know the true identity</i>

00:19.387 --> 00:21.186
<i>Of the president's mistress.</i>
<i>(clicks)</i>

00:21.188 --> 00:26.025
<i>Come out of the woodwork</i>
<i>and more details emerge.</i>

00:26.027 --> 00:28.027
<i>Can you give us an idea</i>
<i>of how high up</i>

00:28.029 --> 00:33.098
<i>No, but I will say that</i>
<i>my source is 100% sure...</i>
<i>(lock clicks)</i>

00:33.100 --> 00:34.700
<i>That ms. Pope is</i>
<i>the president's mistress,</i>

00:34.702 --> 00:36.101
<i>And if they're right--</i>

00:36.103 --> 00:37.736
<i>And obviously I believe</i>
<i>they are--</i>

00:37.738 --> 00:40.139
<i>It's only a matter of time</i>
<i>before more details come out.</i>

00:46.179 --> 00:48.213
22 minutes
without making a sound.

00:48.215 --> 00:51.150
If only you'd been
this quiet as a child.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.119
Why did you try
to have me killed?

00:54.121 --> 00:55.421
I didn't try
to have you killed.

00:55.423 --> 00:58.490
I tried to have
jake ballard killed.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.726
Hmm. We're here.

01:07.834 --> 01:11.136
No.
You've gotten yourself into
a bit of trouble, olivia,

01:11.138 --> 01:14.073
And I'm here to fix it.
No.

01:14.075 --> 01:15.808
Now listen to me.
You raised your skirt

01:15.810 --> 01:18.210
And opened your knees
and gave it away

01:18.212 --> 01:19.745
To a man
with too much power.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.847
You're not rare.
You're not special.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.849
Your story's no different
than a thousand other stories

01:23.851 --> 01:25.684
In this town,
so you know how this goes.

01:25.686 --> 01:29.555
First they'll smile, be warm,
sympathetic, on your side,

01:29.557 --> 01:31.390
Letting you know that
they will fight for you.

01:31.392 --> 01:34.560
They will lull you into
a false sense of security.

01:34.562 --> 01:37.563
And then, once your belly
is exposed,

01:37.565 --> 01:40.599
They will gut you
and everyone you know.

01:40.601 --> 01:44.203
And by the time you realize
you should be fighting back,

01:44.205 --> 01:46.839
Well, you're already
bleeding to death.

01:46.841 --> 01:50.442
<i>That</i> is the presidency
versus you.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.778
Whose victory do you think
they will fight for?

01:52.780 --> 01:55.114
Whose body do you think
they will bury?

01:55.116 --> 01:57.416
He would never--
"he would never."

01:57.418 --> 02:00.652
You and I both know
that he is <i>not</i> in charge.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.188
He is <i>never</i> in charge.

02:03.190 --> 02:04.823
Power is in charge.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.726
Power got him elected.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.729
I know more than you could
possibly imagine

02:10.731 --> 02:14.466
About things of which
you cannot dream.

02:14.468 --> 02:19.238
He told you that you
would be first lady,

02:19.240 --> 02:21.340
And    <i>y</i>believed him!

02:21.342 --> 02:24.343
Did I not raise you
for better?

02:24.345 --> 02:26.912
How many times have I told you
you have to be...

02:26.914 --> 02:29.148
What?

02:30.817 --> 02:35.821
You have to be...
What?

02:35.823 --> 02:36.855
Twice...

02:36.857 --> 02:39.391
<i>What?!</i>

02:39.393 --> 02:41.693
(voice breaks)
twice as good.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.462
Twice as good as them

02:43.464 --> 02:46.498
To get <i>half</i>
<i>of what they have.</i>

02:46.500 --> 02:49.334
Sleeping with that...
(sighs)

02:49.336 --> 02:52.404
For god sakes!

02:52.406 --> 02:55.307
You know to aim higher.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.309
At the very least,
you could have aimed for

02:57.311 --> 02:59.244
Chief of staff,
secretary of state!

02:59.246 --> 03:01.880
First lady!

03:04.450 --> 03:06.919
Do you have to be
so mediocre?

03:21.501 --> 03:23.402
Your staff will be
taken care of financially.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.904
Your business will continue
to run.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.873
Money is not a problem.
There's always money.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.275
Money bought that plane.
Money bought the silence

03:30.277 --> 03:32.311
Of the gentleman
who will fly that plane.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.880
On board, you will
find an envelope.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.482
It contains a passport,
a swiss bank book,

03:37.484 --> 03:40.352
A go file,
an entirely new identity.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.588
There is a very nice island
waiting for you

03:42.590 --> 03:43.922
At the end of the flight.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.358
You will stay there
for eight months.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.294
Then I can arrange
a place for you in brussels.

03:49.296 --> 03:51.797
Thailand, if you prefer,
johannesburg--

03:51.799 --> 03:54.933
Anyplace but here, really,
as long as you disappear.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.702
And what if I don't want
to go?

03:56.704 --> 03:58.737
Olivia, you're getting
on that plane

03:58.739 --> 04:00.505
Come hell or high water.

04:00.507 --> 04:03.675
And to be clear,
<i>I</i> am the hell

04:03.677 --> 04:05.978
<i>And</i> the high water.

04:07.547 --> 04:13.318
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

04:13.320 --> 04:17.256
(airplane engines whirring)

04:17.258 --> 04:19.291
We'll be taking off in a moment.
Can I get you anything to drink?

04:19.293 --> 04:21.326
No. Thank you.

04:21.328 --> 04:24.029
Can I...
Borrow your phone?

04:26.833 --> 04:28.000
(sighs) where are you?

04:28.002 --> 04:29.935
I'm sitting in a jet
on a runway.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.037
Where are you going?
Nowhere. I'm disappearing.

04:32.039 --> 04:35.307
That is not an option.
It is. Apparently,
it's very simple.

04:35.309 --> 04:39.478
I just get on this plane
and I disappear into thin air.

04:42.715 --> 04:45.317
Get off the plane.
Don't run.

04:45.319 --> 04:47.986
You need me here so you can
throw me under the bus?

04:47.988 --> 04:50.689
I know how this goes. I can
run this play in my sleep.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.325
You'll burn me.
I won't burn you.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.894
Not unless you burn me.
We are on the same side.
Are we?

04:55.896 --> 04:57.029
Who leaked my name, cy?

04:57.031 --> 04:58.997
When I find out,
they will suffer.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.465
Get off the plane!

05:00.467 --> 05:01.967
I just wanted to say good-bye.
Olivia--

05:01.969 --> 05:04.703
Tell him I said good-bye.
Olivia. Olivia!

05:04.705 --> 05:05.971
What?

05:05.973 --> 05:09.908
If you... Disappear--
if you <i>disappear,</i>

05:09.910 --> 05:11.910
He will think
that I had you killed.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.612
And he will never trust me
again.

05:13.614 --> 05:14.913
He barely trusts me
as it is,

05:14.915 --> 05:17.649
And I will not be able
to help him out of this.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.085
If he thinks you're dead,
I won't be able to save him.

05:21.854 --> 05:23.922
Don't run!
I have done dark things,

05:23.924 --> 05:26.091
But I have also been your friend
and your champion.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.026
When you aren't a monster?

05:28.028 --> 05:30.996
I am a monster, but, honey,
I'm your monster!

05:30.998 --> 05:32.764
And I will fix this.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.900
I will put this ridiculous,
untrue rumor

05:34.902 --> 05:37.769
About you having an affair
with the president to rest.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.905
I will put it down.
I will bury it!

05:39.907 --> 05:41.440
I just need a little time,

05:41.442 --> 05:44.676
And I just need you
not to run.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.011
(breathing heavily)

05:46.013 --> 05:48.447
I need you to get off
the plane, my friend.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.682
Get off the plane.

05:57.890 --> 05:59.691
Olivia!
I'm not going.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.992
Yes, you are.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.761
Thanks for the offer, but no.

06:02.763 --> 06:06.064
I am many things.
Stupid is not one of them.

06:06.066 --> 06:09.000
Olivia, you can't possibly think
you're going to return

06:09.002 --> 06:11.970
To your old life
as if nothing is happening.

06:11.972 --> 06:15.774
What is happening is that I am
taking care of myself!

06:15.776 --> 06:18.510
Take me to my office.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.147
The white house
will destroy you.

06:22.149 --> 06:25.817
That's what mom used to
tell me about you.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.853
(window whirs)

06:32.992 --> 06:36.895
Like I said and will continue
to say in a variety of ways,

06:36.897 --> 06:40.432
The white house has no official
comment on these accusations

06:40.434 --> 06:43.568
And no plans to comment further.
(reporters shouting questions)

06:43.570 --> 06:44.870
You want the vice president

06:44.872 --> 06:46.738
To take on the president's
public appearances

06:46.740 --> 06:48.573
In the middle of all this?
Th-that--

06:48.575 --> 06:50.041
Until I can find the source
of the fire and put it out,

06:50.043 --> 06:53.845
She's gonna get the questions.
<i>All</i> the questions.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.981
Then she'll dodge them
and be very good at it.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.116
Cyrus, maybe you and I should
get together and discuss this.
I don't think so.

06:58.118 --> 07:01.086
Ma'am!
No, I will not be
aiding and abetting a man

07:01.088 --> 07:03.121
Breaking his marriage vows
and laying with another woman.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.924
I will not be surrendering
that piece of my soul.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.759
I am the lord's witness.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.662
No...

07:10.664 --> 07:12.664
No! The people.

07:12.666 --> 07:15.667
The people,
madame vice president...

07:15.669 --> 07:18.670
(chuckles) the people
elected you

07:18.672 --> 07:21.606
To be the president's sidekick,
not the lord!

07:21.608 --> 07:24.109
The lord did not fill out
his voter registration card.

07:24.111 --> 07:27.546
So guess what. The lord
does not have the right to vote

07:27.548 --> 07:29.548
In the United States
of america!

07:29.550 --> 07:31.550
I am done with you
and your superiority

07:31.552 --> 07:32.851
And your rudeness.

07:32.853 --> 07:35.687
I have never once mentioned
how I feel about

07:35.689 --> 07:37.756
Your godless homosexual
lifestyle

07:37.758 --> 07:40.792
And that poor, sweet
brown baby

07:40.794 --> 07:42.861
That you have dragged
into it.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.996
I keep my personal opinions
to myself.

07:44.998 --> 07:49.167
But you find any opportunity
each and every day to belittle

07:49.169 --> 07:51.536
Me and my desire
to serve the lord.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.905
You have no respect.
Not for me, not for the voters

07:53.907 --> 07:56.675
I handed you on a platter
the last election,

07:56.677 --> 07:58.844
The voters I will take with me
when I go.

07:58.846 --> 08:01.580
Go? Wh-where are you going!?
Canada?

08:01.582 --> 08:03.915
Because that's the only place
you have a chance

08:03.917 --> 08:06.051
Of being elected
on a sitting president

08:06.053 --> 08:08.587
From your own party, who--

08:08.589 --> 08:10.922
Who is sleeping with whores!
I'd like to speak
with sally alone, please.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.925
Alone.
(sally sighs)

08:13.927 --> 08:15.060
Please.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.728
(whispers) okay.

08:16.730 --> 08:20.532
Okay.
(sighs)

08:20.534 --> 08:22.100
(door opens)

08:24.704 --> 08:26.838
(inhales and sighs)

08:28.875 --> 08:30.775
Well?

08:30.777 --> 08:33.778
Do you drink ever?
Excuse me?

08:33.780 --> 08:35.647
I'm not trying to just...

08:35.649 --> 08:37.716
If you were a man,
I'd offer you a scotch.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.684
And I thought, I'm kind of
an ass if I only offer you

08:39.686 --> 08:41.553
The scotch if you're a man.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.154
What is that? Some
prep school crap I learned.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.257
Uh... Anyway,

08:45.259 --> 08:47.125
Do you... Drink?

08:47.127 --> 08:49.694
(inhales sharply)

08:49.696 --> 08:52.597
I would like a scotch.
Neat.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.702
Sally... (exhales)

08:57.704 --> 08:58.837
Yes?

08:58.839 --> 09:01.706
(pours liquor, bottle clatters)

09:01.708 --> 09:05.777
I slept with someone
who is not my wife.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.649
You're not surprised
that I cheated.

09:10.651 --> 09:11.917
You're surprised
that I'm admitting it.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.052
(pours liquor)
which is...

09:14.054 --> 09:17.622
(bottle clatters)
I did. I had an affair.

09:17.624 --> 09:21.593
I take responsibility,
and I'm sorry.

09:22.862 --> 09:23.995
I failed you.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.797
Me, sir?

09:25.799 --> 09:28.199
You. As your team member,
as your president,

09:28.201 --> 09:31.036
As your fellow citizen.

09:31.038 --> 09:34.072
I did not live up to my promise
to be the best man I could be.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.907
I lied.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.777
I lived a lie.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.912
And I am sorry about that.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.848
Okay?

09:45.585 --> 09:46.918
All right, mr. President.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.120
Okay.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.590
So...

09:51.592 --> 09:53.758
These public appearances
cyrus is asking you

09:53.760 --> 09:55.226
To stand in on for me...
Sir?

09:55.228 --> 09:58.863
Sally, it's time for me
to do the right thing.

09:58.865 --> 10:01.733
Be the leader I've always
wanted to be.

10:01.735 --> 10:04.603
In order to do so, I have to
stand in front of the world

10:04.605 --> 10:06.071
And say who I am
and what I've done

10:06.073 --> 10:07.739
And deal
with the consequences,

10:07.741 --> 10:11.009
That moment is coming,
and I want it to come.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.612
What I'm asking you

10:13.614 --> 10:17.248
Is for the chance
to buy a little time

10:17.250 --> 10:20.752
To get the people in my life
ready for that moment.

10:22.888 --> 10:24.656
Can you do that for me?

10:25.992 --> 10:29.361
(inhales)

10:29.363 --> 10:31.363
Yes. (exhales)

10:31.365 --> 10:32.797
Yes, I can.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.968
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

10:36.970 --> 10:40.805
(man) there she is!

10:40.807 --> 10:44.342
(reporters shouting questions,
camera shutters clicking)

10:44.344 --> 10:46.177
(pounding on limousine)

10:46.179 --> 10:50.248
(clamoring)

10:50.250 --> 10:52.751
(man) move out of the way!

10:52.753 --> 10:55.086
Get off the car!
Don't!

10:55.088 --> 10:56.755
Move out of the way!

10:56.757 --> 10:58.723
Hey. Hey!

10:58.725 --> 11:01.359
(camera shutter clicking)

11:01.361 --> 11:04.763
(clamoring continues)

11:04.765 --> 11:07.365
Olivia! Take my hand.

11:07.367 --> 11:11.269
(all shouting at once)

11:11.271 --> 11:12.937
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

11:12.939 --> 11:15.106
(shouting continues)

11:15.108 --> 11:16.708
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

11:18.878 --> 11:20.812
(abby) what should we do?
What's our first move?

11:20.814 --> 11:22.847
We do nothing.
It's being handled,

11:22.849 --> 11:24.249
Which means all of you can
go back to work,

11:24.251 --> 11:25.950
Business as usual.
Business as usual?

11:25.952 --> 11:27.285
How is that even possible?

11:27.287 --> 11:29.354
You pick up the phone
and call our clients.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.323
Show them we're as dedicated
to them as ever.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.392
<i>What?</i>
<i>Are we really not gonna</i>
<i>talking about</i>

11:34.394 --> 11:37.062
The fact that you're the most
infamous woman in america...
The world.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.730
In the <i>world</i> right now?!

11:38.732 --> 11:42.000
It's being handled.
By who? The white house?

11:42.002 --> 11:44.002
Liv, the phone has been ringing
off the hook all morning.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.237
Aside from the reporters,
the only people getting through

11:46.239 --> 11:47.872
Are clients calling to fire us.

11:50.276 --> 11:52.744
It's olivia pope
for governor suarez.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.046
Yes, that olivia pope.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.982
The white house is going
to bury her!

11:57.984 --> 11:59.484
Okay, jeff, your call,
but don't call me in two hours

11:59.486 --> 12:01.252
When this nonsense blows over.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.389
And you know who goes down
with her? Us. We all burn.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.057
You know it, I know it,
everybody knows it.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.193
Ambassador heller,
<i>guten tag.</i>

12:08.195 --> 12:09.828
There is no one else on earth

12:09.830 --> 12:11.496
Who can handle something
like this better than we can.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.064
(pounds desk)
so that's what we do.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.866
Senator, I understand
you're in a tough position.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.401
I do, but honestly, so was I

12:16.403 --> 12:18.203
When I defended your son
who was guilty of rape.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.138
I never once left your side,
and--

12:20.140 --> 12:22.841
We handle it.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.809
Even if liv won't.

12:26.045 --> 12:28.313
(voice breaks) I understand.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.016
Good-bye, sandra.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.818
(sets down phone)
(exhales)

12:33.820 --> 12:36.421
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

12:39.158 --> 12:41.192
Hello, sweetheart.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.527
You want something.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.163
Shame to get scooped
by a society page blogger.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.531
She's so beneath you.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.867
How does someone
that low-level get access

12:48.869 --> 12:50.001
To white house sources?

12:50.003 --> 12:51.803
Is she making it up
just to get ahead

12:51.805 --> 12:53.805
Or sleeping with someone...
No.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.240
You know, we're not
playing this game.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.808
I'm playing,
and if you play, too,

12:56.810 --> 12:58.042
You get a prize, a scoop.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.244
A scoop?

12:59.246 --> 13:00.411
A good one.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.850
Malloy's.
Excuse me?

13:05.852 --> 13:07.418
Bottom feeders like vanessa
tend to troll

13:07.420 --> 13:09.788
For crumbs of gossip
at malloy's.

13:09.790 --> 13:10.555
What's special
about malloy's?

13:10.557 --> 13:13.358
Secret service
drinks there.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.163
Sweetheart!

13:18.165 --> 13:20.465
You owe me!

13:35.881 --> 13:38.082
Hal.
Ma'am.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.852
I need to ask you
a question, hal,

13:40.854 --> 13:42.854
And I would like you
to be honest with me.

13:42.856 --> 13:46.157
About olivia pope
and my husband got started?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.458
(sighs)

13:47.460 --> 13:49.394
I only ask because I know
that sometimes

13:49.396 --> 13:51.229
You and the other agents
like to drink at malloy's

13:51.231 --> 13:53.865
After work, and there's
always journalists there

13:53.867 --> 13:56.935
Waiting around to pick up
a crumb or two.

13:58.938 --> 14:01.039
I know a vindictive housewife
when I see one.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.874
That woman couldn't wait
to tell the world

14:02.876 --> 14:04.375
Her husband couldn't
keep it in his pants.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.844
Do you blame her?

14:05.846 --> 14:10.548
One of their trusted advisers
right under her nose.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.151
You want another drink?
You're buying.

14:16.555 --> 14:18.890
Did you give her a name?

14:18.892 --> 14:21.960
Did... You... Give... Her
a  <i>name?</i>

14:22.561 --> 14:23.595
No.

14:23.597 --> 14:26.097
No, I didn't. I did not.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.117
Hate to be in your shoes.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.585
You shouldn't be here.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.254
Why? Because
I'm the u.S. Attorney

14:49.256 --> 14:51.256
For the district of columbia
and may be asked

14:51.258 --> 14:53.258
To investigate
the president's affair with you?

14:53.260 --> 14:55.627
I left that hat at the door.

14:55.629 --> 14:57.996
David--
don't say anything.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.265
I'm here as your friend,
and the less you say,

15:00.267 --> 15:01.900
The less I'll know
when the democratic leadership

15:01.902 --> 15:03.534
Pulls me into a room
and asks me

15:03.536 --> 15:05.136
All their questions
about you.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.005
So have you
made up your mind?

15:07.007 --> 15:09.374
About what?

15:09.376 --> 15:11.142
About which road
you're gonna take.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.611
The hard one where you put on
the white hat

15:13.613 --> 15:15.046
And admit everything
up front,

15:15.048 --> 15:17.482
Or the harder one,
the one that could destroy

15:17.484 --> 15:19.517
Not only you,
but everyone you hold dear.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.152
The one I don't want to see you
anywhere near.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.154
You're making
a lot of assumptions.

15:23.156 --> 15:26.557
Perhaps, but if there's proof,
it won't take much.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.397
Hey, what's he...
What are you doing here?

15:32.399 --> 15:33.965
Missed you, too.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.066
Hey, return my calls.

15:35.068 --> 15:38.136
Liv, turn on your tv.

15:40.173 --> 15:45.209
<i>This one provided by</i>
<i>one of our viewers, who--</i>

15:45.211 --> 15:47.378
<i>Can we bring up the video?</i>
<i>There it is.</i>

15:47.380 --> 15:49.380
<i>You'll forgive</i>
<i>the graphic content.</i>

15:49.382 --> 15:51.316
<i>There is a young man</i>
<i>relieving himself</i>

15:51.318 --> 15:54.719
<i>In the foreground, but there,</i>
<i>in the background--</i>

15:54.721 --> 15:56.087
<i>Freeze that imagine.</i>

15:56.089 --> 15:57.588
<i>See?</i>

15:57.590 --> 15:59.691
<i>That's president grant.</i>

15:59.693 --> 16:03.628
<i>That's the building</i>
<i>where olivia pope lives.</i>

16:03.630 --> 16:07.098
<i>The first real evidence</i>
<i>that olivia pope</i>

16:07.100 --> 16:09.400
<i>Is the president's mistress.</i>

16:10.602 --> 16:12.670
What's our next move?

16:20.112 --> 16:22.380
Start a kill folder
on olivia pope.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.654
(cell phone rings, beeps)

16:29.656 --> 16:31.456
Who are you,
and how did you get this number?

16:31.458 --> 16:33.124
Harrison wright,
pope and associates.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.193
Do you have something
from olivia?
No.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.627
Then I don't know you.
But you know this town,

16:36.629 --> 16:38.296
And if the president was
having an affair with someone

16:38.298 --> 16:40.365
Who worked for him,
someone who does favors for him,

16:40.367 --> 16:41.599
Someone he does favors for,

16:41.601 --> 16:43.034
There are going to be
subcommittees

16:43.036 --> 16:44.469
On the subcommittees.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.337
There are gonna be special
hearings that drag on for years.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.306
And it doesn't matter
if anything unethical happened.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.041
He'll be lucky
if this thing is over

16:50.043 --> 16:51.442
By the time he's cutting
the ribbon on his library

16:51.444 --> 16:56.114
It can't be liv. For all
our sakes, it can't be liv.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.349
As I've said,
I don't know you.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.318
Don't call me again.
(beeps)

17:00.320 --> 17:02.253
(beep)

17:02.255 --> 17:04.522
(sighs)

17:04.524 --> 17:06.424
Olivia carolyn pope.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.292
Princeton undergrad,
georgetown law.

17:08.294 --> 17:10.294
Yes, I was there. I know.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.463
Only child. Mother maya
was in a plane crash,

17:12.465 --> 17:14.465
Died when olivia was 12.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.335
Father eli curates antiquities
at the smithsonian.

17:17.337 --> 17:20.405
Has ever since graduating
princeton in '67.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.340
Where are the family photos?
There are none.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.742
It's a very private family,
by all accounts.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.310
Didn't hang
with the georgetown set.

17:26.312 --> 17:30.314
Most of his income on boarding
schools for his daughter,

17:30.316 --> 17:32.383
Because she has been
to nothing but the best--

17:32.385 --> 17:34.685
St. Anne's, surval montreux--

17:34.687 --> 17:37.555
But she never lived
in the family home again

17:37.557 --> 17:40.191
After her mother's death.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.393
(clicks tongue)
I never knew that about her.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.662
We're thinking that's where
she got the daddy issues.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.497
Pope has a well-documented
preference

17:46.499 --> 17:48.299
For powerful older men.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.601
In fact, after college,
she had quite the reputation

17:50.603 --> 17:52.270
As a party girl.

17:52.272 --> 17:56.407
Ambassadors, lobbyists,
cabinet secretaries--

17:56.409 --> 17:58.476
A nice lineup
of silver foxes.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.511
She was working her way
up the totem pole.

18:00.513 --> 18:03.147
Enough!
Enough?

18:03.149 --> 18:06.851
To play
the ambitious slut card.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.419
Good work.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.388
Yeah.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.557
(papers shuffling)

18:13.792 --> 18:16.761
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

18:22.334 --> 18:25.403
(cell phone chimes)

18:26.672 --> 18:28.272
(chimes)

18:28.274 --> 18:29.307
(clicks and beeps)

18:29.309 --> 18:30.508
Hello?

18:32.811 --> 18:35.213
What are you doing here?
Trying to help you,

18:35.215 --> 18:36.681
And given all the press
that's gathered outside,

18:36.683 --> 18:39.283
You're in need.
I don't need your help!

18:39.285 --> 18:40.518
So tell me, how's work?

18:40.520 --> 18:42.453
Getting many new clients
these days?

18:42.455 --> 18:44.489
I'll ask the questions.
Mm.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.491
Where is jake ballard?
Olivia...

18:46.493 --> 18:49.694
Where is jake ballard?
That's not a question
you are at liberty to ask.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.729
<i>Where's</i> jake ballard?!

18:51.731 --> 18:53.831
Jake ballard refused
an order.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.334
Where is he
and what have you done with him?

18:56.336 --> 18:58.836
(sighs)

18:58.838 --> 19:03.307
No one refuses an order

19:03.309 --> 19:05.343
In my business.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.411
Now you may choose
to not understand that.

19:07.413 --> 19:10.515
You may choose to
feel disgust at that.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.517
You may choose to pretend
that what you do

19:12.519 --> 19:14.685
And how you live is not
made possible by what <i>I do</i>

19:14.687 --> 19:16.454
And how <i>I live.</i>

19:16.456 --> 19:19.257
I do my job so that fatty
can watch reality tv,

19:19.259 --> 19:23.761
Screw their husbands or their
battery-operated products,

19:23.763 --> 19:26.164
And never use their teeny,
tiny brains

19:26.166 --> 19:29.167
To think about the freedoms
that I make possible!

19:29.169 --> 19:33.704
Never think about the <i>democracy</i>
<i>that I make possible!</i>

19:33.706 --> 19:35.773
They never think about it,
so...

19:35.775 --> 19:38.209
They sleep like babies
at night.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.750
Get on the plane, olivia.
You're running out of options.

19:45.752 --> 19:48.553
I'm never out of options.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.357
(beeps)
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

19:53.359 --> 19:54.825
(exhales)
(door whirs)

19:54.827 --> 19:57.228
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

19:59.364 --> 20:01.599
(clicking)

20:01.601 --> 20:03.501
(telephone rings)

20:03.503 --> 20:04.769
Identification number.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.538
3-zeta-5-1-9-alpha.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.607
Password?
Providence.

20:12.678 --> 20:13.778
(engine starts)

20:13.780 --> 20:16.414
(indistinct conversations)

20:25.357 --> 20:29.327
(indistinct conversations,
clamoring)

20:51.550 --> 20:52.717
(beeps)

20:52.719 --> 20:55.286
(door whirs, opens)

20:58.657 --> 20:59.924
Hi.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.225
Hi.

21:01.227 --> 21:05.363
(door whirs, closes)

21:08.567 --> 21:10.301
Tom.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.402
Where's the president?

21:11.404 --> 21:12.770
He's unavailable, sir.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.039
I need to see him.
Where is he?

21:15.041 --> 21:17.341
We don't have a lot of time.
Do you realize
what you've done?

21:17.343 --> 21:19.043
I do.
You pulled the fire alarm.

21:19.045 --> 21:22.046
I did.
That was a one-time thing,
liv, for extreme emergencies.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.781
I know.
You can't ever use it again.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.549
The codes are already
being rewritten.
I know.

21:25.551 --> 21:27.518
You don't work
in the white house anymore!

21:27.520 --> 21:28.919
You're not in the bubble
anymore!

21:28.921 --> 21:30.655
I can't get the n.S.A.
To overlook

21:30.657 --> 21:32.690
You being issued a providence
key again, not now.

21:32.692 --> 21:33.991
I understand.
If there is an attack--

21:33.993 --> 21:36.994
Terrorist, chemical, nuclear--
I can't get you!

21:36.996 --> 21:38.696
You understand?
You're on the outside.

21:38.698 --> 21:41.365
You're dead, because you
already pulled the fire alarm.

21:41.367 --> 21:44.302
We're already under attack,
and I'm already on the outside.

21:44.304 --> 21:47.038
My name is out there!

21:47.040 --> 21:48.773
We need to talk about
how to fix this.

21:48.775 --> 21:51.309
We need to make a plan.

21:51.311 --> 21:53.377
Okay.

21:54.813 --> 21:55.946
We can do that.

21:55.948 --> 21:57.948
When all of us are here.
All of us?

21:57.950 --> 21:59.650
You asked cyrus to come?

21:59.652 --> 22:00.951
No.

22:00.953 --> 22:04.722
(doors whirs, opens)

22:06.091 --> 22:09.593
So... (sighs)

22:09.595 --> 22:10.761
Let's do this.

22:10.763 --> 22:13.531
The president
is with the first lady...

22:13.533 --> 22:14.932
In private.

22:14.934 --> 22:18.736
Having personal...
Private time.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.938
Fitz and mellie?

22:20.940 --> 22:24.608
I'm sorry, you're saying
the president is off

22:24.610 --> 22:26.977
With his wife,
with mellie...
Mm-hmm.

22:26.979 --> 22:32.416
They didn't say how long...
They'd be... Sir.

22:32.418 --> 22:34.085
I don't see what the problem is.
It's the same plan as always.

22:34.087 --> 22:36.620
Fitz and I hold hands
and smile at oprah

22:36.622 --> 22:38.823
Or barbara walters.
We do what we always do--

22:38.825 --> 22:40.057
Act happy.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.993
And we just deny it.
Deny <i>you.</i>

22:42.995 --> 22:44.829
That would have worked
before.
Before what?

22:44.831 --> 22:46.831
Before you got the bright idea
to go on national television

22:46.833 --> 22:48.132
And tell the world
I cheated on you.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.101
You did cheat on me.
That's not the point.

22:50.103 --> 22:52.803
It's exactly the point.
Not if you want to
smile at oprah.

22:52.805 --> 22:56.107
If you didn't screw your whore
every chance you got.

22:56.109 --> 22:58.976
Mellie. I know the situation
is difficult. I do,

22:58.978 --> 23:00.678
And I'm so, so sorry.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.113
But we have a job to do here,

23:02.115 --> 23:04.115
And in order for me to do
my part effectively,

23:04.117 --> 23:06.684
I'm going to need you to refrain
from referring to me as a whore,

23:06.686 --> 23:09.387
At least in front of my face,
all right?

23:09.389 --> 23:11.021
(huffs)

23:18.497 --> 23:20.030
Now... Mellie's already
told the world

23:20.032 --> 23:23.000
You had an affair with someone,
and my name has been leaked,

23:23.002 --> 23:25.536
So I am now the public face
of that someone.

23:25.538 --> 23:27.071
I don't know.
We've got to figure out a way

23:27.073 --> 23:29.006
To change the narrative or...
Reclaim the narrative.

23:29.008 --> 23:32.143
We tell the truth.
We're looking for a way out.

23:32.145 --> 23:33.677
Why aren't we looking
for a way through?

23:33.679 --> 23:35.546
Why don't we just stand up
and tell the truth?

23:35.548 --> 23:38.048
Mellie and I face the press,
say, "yes. I cheated.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.918
I slept with olivia pope.
I had an affair."

23:40.920 --> 23:42.720
(huffs)

23:42.722 --> 23:45.022
Liv?
I'm thinking.

23:50.061 --> 23:52.096
You and mellie do a statement
in the press room.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.964
No. In the rose garden.

23:53.966 --> 23:56.133
Full press, no questions.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.935
You hold hands.
Mellie wears a soft color--

23:57.937 --> 24:00.004
Lavender or light blue.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.672
You bring in the kids
from boarding school,

24:01.674 --> 24:03.174
But you don't have them
with you for the statement.

24:03.176 --> 24:05.509
That always looks staged.
The kids look like pawns

24:05.511 --> 24:07.211
And the parents seem
opportunistic.

24:07.213 --> 24:08.779
But the photo op after

24:08.781 --> 24:10.614
Of you both meeting
jerry and karen

24:10.616 --> 24:12.683
As they step off the chopper?
That's kennedy.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.452
Perfect, especially
if baby teddy is running

24:14.454 --> 24:15.820
On the grass beside you.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.788
The next day,
you do one sit-down--

24:17.790 --> 24:20.024
A full tell-all.
I'd go with james.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.625
He did the mellie interview.

24:21.627 --> 24:22.760
The public will like
the story of seeing him

24:22.762 --> 24:24.094
Talking to both of you now.

24:24.096 --> 24:25.830
They like knowing
that he's a family friend,

24:25.832 --> 24:27.865
Plus cyrus can control him.

24:27.867 --> 24:30.000
12 hours before
your sit-down with james,

24:30.002 --> 24:32.470
I'll release a paper statement.

24:32.472 --> 24:34.972
"I regret my affair.
I've apologized to mellie.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.874
I've prayed,"
blah, blah, blah,

24:36.876 --> 24:39.944
"trying to put the whole thing
behind me," etcetera.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.047
Barring any kind of
special prosecutor probe

24:43.049 --> 24:45.115
Into whether or not I was given
any favors

24:45.117 --> 24:46.750
Because of the relationship,

24:46.752 --> 24:48.252
The whole thing should be
put to bed

24:48.254 --> 24:50.988
Well before
the primary elections are over.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.057
It works.

24:54.526 --> 24:55.826
The truth works.

24:57.863 --> 24:58.996
The irony.

25:00.532 --> 25:02.132
I'm sorry.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.635
The truth does not work.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.537
It does not work for <i>me.</i>

25:06.539 --> 25:08.005
They're gonna want details,
fitz.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.507
<i>That's</i> how this works.

25:09.509 --> 25:12.510
The reporters,
the special prosecutor--details.

25:12.512 --> 25:14.144
Dates and times
and locations.

25:14.146 --> 25:16.046
When did the affair start?
When did it end?

25:16.048 --> 25:18.082
How long did it last?
What happened when?

25:18.084 --> 25:20.985
What did mellie know,
and when did she know it?

25:20.987 --> 25:23.587
And... If all we had
to talk about

25:23.589 --> 25:26.190
And a cigar that had been
in interesting places,

25:26.192 --> 25:28.192
I'd be fine.
I would not give a damn.

25:28.194 --> 25:32.162
But I am not going to stand
in the rose garden

25:32.164 --> 25:35.299
And hold your hand while you
tell the white house press corps

25:35.301 --> 25:38.068
That you had an affair
with olivia pope

25:38.070 --> 25:40.137
That lasted a year.

25:40.139 --> 25:42.706
(chuckles) and then ended
and then started again

25:42.708 --> 25:45.042
And then ended
and then started again.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.744
And I am certainly not
gonna sit

25:46.746 --> 25:48.145
In the blue room
of the white house

25:48.147 --> 25:49.980
And hold your hand
while you tell james

25:49.982 --> 25:51.215
How you couldn't keep
your hands off her

25:51.217 --> 25:53.050
On the campaign trail,

25:53.052 --> 25:55.019
How the secret service
drives you to her apartment

25:55.021 --> 25:57.821
In defiance
of security protocols,

25:57.823 --> 25:59.857
How when you were shot,
the name that you called out

25:59.859 --> 26:03.594
Was "olivia,"
or any of the many ways

26:03.596 --> 26:05.763
That you have degraded
our marriage,

26:05.765 --> 26:07.998
Because that is not you
making a mistake.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.333
That is not you cheating
on me.

26:09.335 --> 26:12.102
That is you... (sighs)

26:12.104 --> 26:14.738
That is me being in love
with another woman.

26:16.875 --> 26:17.975
(breath shudders)

26:21.846 --> 26:24.315
If you try to tell that
disgusting fairy tale

26:24.317 --> 26:26.917
To the press,

26:26.919 --> 26:30.321
I will make such a scene.

26:30.323 --> 26:31.689
I will open up our closet

26:31.691 --> 26:32.990
And I will pull out
our laundry,

26:32.992 --> 26:35.859
And I will share it
with the <i>world.</i>

26:35.861 --> 26:39.363
I am that... Tired.

26:39.365 --> 26:40.965
(inhales and exhales deeply)

26:46.004 --> 26:48.372
How many times?
What?

26:48.374 --> 26:52.142
How many times
did fitz and I sleep together?

26:52.144 --> 26:54.044
Three? Five?

26:54.046 --> 26:56.080
How many
would you be okay with?

27:04.122 --> 27:05.189
Two.

27:05.191 --> 27:07.992
Okay.

27:07.994 --> 27:11.128
Fitz and I slept together
twice.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.097
The first time was?
After I was elected.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.399
You didn't get the job because
we were sleeping together.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.301
Might as well make sure
nobody questions that.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.637
So the first time was
after you took office.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.138
The night
of the inauguration.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.873
Fitz and I attended
four inaugural balls.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.041
We were supposed to go
to six,

27:24.043 --> 27:26.343
But fitz said
he was exhausted, and...

27:26.345 --> 27:29.713
Honestly, so was I.
It'd been a long day.

27:29.715 --> 27:34.018
So... We came back
to the white house.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.886
And I went right to bed,

27:35.888 --> 27:39.123
But fitz was just wired,
so...

27:39.125 --> 27:43.360
He went down to the oval office
to just take it in...

27:43.362 --> 27:46.130
Which is where
he ran into you.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.232
I'm guessing it was
no coincidence,

27:48.234 --> 27:49.867
Since he made a call
from our bedroom,

27:49.869 --> 27:52.870
But let's leave that part out
when we tell the story.

27:54.139 --> 27:56.707
(exhales)
let's just say

27:56.709 --> 27:58.108
That the two of you
got to talking,

27:58.110 --> 28:00.811
And...

28:00.813 --> 28:02.446
One thing led to another.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.782
It was just sex.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.450
It didn't mean anything.

28:06.452 --> 28:10.187
And you felt terrible
afterwards.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.723
And it didn't happen
again until...

28:12.725 --> 28:14.158
(gasps softly)

28:14.160 --> 28:16.260
After you got shot.

28:30.241 --> 28:32.076
Okay.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.813
So... Twice.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.815
The first time
was after the inauguration,

28:37.817 --> 28:39.049
And then the second time...

28:39.051 --> 28:42.052
After the assassination
attempt.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.354
You had sex...

28:44.356 --> 28:46.256
Once...

28:48.893 --> 28:52.763
After you recovered
from your gunshot wounds...

28:52.765 --> 28:55.399
Because you were feeling
your mortality.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.434
Facing death.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.839
(exhales)

29:03.975 --> 29:05.342
Once on inauguration night,

29:05.344 --> 29:07.344
And once after
the assassination attempt.

29:07.346 --> 29:08.412
I'm not lying.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.047
It's still the truth.

29:10.049 --> 29:12.449
Just not the whole truth.

29:15.787 --> 29:17.354
Are we agreed?

29:24.863 --> 29:26.096
Yeah. (sighs softly)

29:36.374 --> 29:37.508
Agreed.

29:37.510 --> 29:40.544
(inhales and exhales sharply)

29:40.546 --> 29:42.146
(pounds on door)

29:43.915 --> 29:46.483
(door clanks and whirs)

29:46.485 --> 29:48.552
(door whirs and clanks closed)

29:48.554 --> 29:49.820
Liv...

29:49.822 --> 29:51.488
I'm fine.
I'm sorry.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.190
I know that wasn't easy
for you.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.158
I'm fine.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.093
I'm not.

29:58.129 --> 30:00.931
How are you?

30:00.933 --> 30:03.333
Really?
I'm... Fine.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.435
Your name's a headline.
You're not fine.

30:05.437 --> 30:07.871
I tell my clients all the time
that it's not personal.

30:07.873 --> 30:09.273
The reporters--
they're just doing their jobs.

30:09.275 --> 30:11.175
It's not personal.
It's not about me.

30:11.177 --> 30:12.309
It's the story.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.078
I'm fine.

30:20.385 --> 30:22.586
Don't.

30:23.521 --> 30:25.255
Don't. (gasps)

30:26.124 --> 30:28.892
(gasps)

30:34.365 --> 30:35.432
(exhales)

30:35.434 --> 30:38.235
(gasps)

30:40.205 --> 30:43.106
(sobbing)

30:43.108 --> 30:44.341
Mm-hmm.

30:44.343 --> 30:48.111
(continues sobbing)

30:55.086 --> 30:57.921
(sniffles)

30:57.923 --> 31:00.057
(pounds on door)

31:00.059 --> 31:02.426
(door whirs)

31:02.428 --> 31:05.162
(door whirs, clanks closed)

31:08.233 --> 31:09.967
(door opens)

31:09.969 --> 31:11.969
Thanks for seeing me
this morning, sally.

31:11.971 --> 31:13.203
(door closes)
scotch?

31:13.205 --> 31:16.206
A touch early for me, sir.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.609
How was the senate
women's caucus?

31:18.611 --> 31:21.478
Angry at you,
but I handled them.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.881
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.616
I hope you've been
using the time wisely.

31:25.618 --> 31:27.918
I wrote a speech,

31:27.920 --> 31:30.487
Taking full responsibility.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.489
Mellie and I are facing
the press at noon today.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.992
Mellie's standing with you?

31:34.994 --> 31:36.493
So your marriage will weather
this storm.

31:36.495 --> 31:38.629
There are the children
to consider.

31:38.631 --> 31:40.998
Well, that's...

31:41.000 --> 31:43.667
I'm glad for you.

31:43.669 --> 31:46.436
It's refreshing to hear
a man valuing the family.

31:46.438 --> 31:47.671
(exhales)

31:47.673 --> 31:49.473
Good men are hard
to come by.

31:52.277 --> 31:53.677
How is dan these days?

31:53.679 --> 31:55.946
Oh, fine.

31:55.948 --> 31:57.614
Fine. (sighs)

31:57.616 --> 32:01.051
Moving to d.C. Has been
exciting for him.

32:01.053 --> 32:04.554
My husband is having just
a little bit more...

32:04.556 --> 32:07.991
Fun... These days.

32:07.993 --> 32:11.662
He's still the same
daniel douglas. He's just...

32:11.664 --> 32:13.563
Fun now.

32:17.568 --> 32:22.072
I am the most powerful woman
in the free world.

32:22.074 --> 32:25.943
There are challenges
associated with that.

32:31.049 --> 32:33.617
Sally...

32:33.619 --> 32:36.053
Yes, mr. President?

32:39.490 --> 32:41.625
After my speech,

32:41.627 --> 32:44.728
There will be a window.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.463
Climb through it.

32:46.465 --> 32:50.500
Be bold. Condemn me.

32:50.502 --> 32:53.136
Make yourself
the moral center of the party.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.974
Use the moment to rise.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.978
Can you do that?

33:02.680 --> 33:04.548
Oh, I believe I can,
mr. President.

33:07.652 --> 33:11.355
Why are you helping me?

33:11.357 --> 33:13.056
Why are you extending
kindness?

33:17.128 --> 33:19.663
Because we are not married
to one another.

33:35.513 --> 33:36.780
Why did you schedule
the press conference?

33:36.782 --> 33:38.782
Because our president
told me to.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.150
Because you had
a secret meeting.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.718
They want to go public.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.353
Again, aren't you
part of "they" now?

33:43.355 --> 33:45.589
One-third of some secret
unholy political trinity.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.457
They want to go public,
and we need to stop them

33:47.459 --> 33:48.759
And fix this.

33:48.761 --> 33:50.527
How?
Presser's in three hours.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.129
I think I have a plan.

33:52.131 --> 33:54.364
It just needs to come
from the outside.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.767
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

33:56.769 --> 33:59.336
I feel horrible about this.
We're doing the right thing.

33:59.338 --> 34:00.704
Olivia says
what the right thing is.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.005
Look, it's not too late
to pull back.

34:02.007 --> 34:03.340
Couldn't we just
kill another intern?

34:03.342 --> 34:04.541
It wouldn't be that hard.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.245
A bad one. The worst one.

34:08.247 --> 34:09.613
All right, we need to be
united on this.

34:09.615 --> 34:10.680
Are we united on this?

34:10.682 --> 34:12.616
If I do this,
we all do this.

34:12.618 --> 34:15.085
You have to have my back.

34:18.489 --> 34:22.759
Are we gladiators,
or... Are we bitches?

34:22.761 --> 34:26.129
I need to hear it.

34:26.131 --> 34:28.465
(all) gladiators.

34:28.467 --> 34:29.866
Damn right.

34:33.671 --> 34:38.408
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

34:40.579 --> 34:45.348
Just a couple of details about
the president's statement today.

34:45.350 --> 34:46.817
Is he gonna admit
to anything this time?

34:46.819 --> 34:48.485
'cause if it's
just another duck--

34:48.487 --> 34:52.122
Of the president's statement.
That's not why I'm here.

34:52.124 --> 34:54.658
I am here to remind you that
we're going live today...

34:54.660 --> 34:57.160
(murmuring)
at 12:04 from the... (chuckles)

34:57.162 --> 34:58.829
(man) turn that up.
Okay, come on, you guys.

34:58.831 --> 35:02.766
<i>I think that governor grant</i>
<i>has the election in the bag.</i>

35:02.768 --> 35:06.470
<i>I mean, he really cares</i>
<i>about the middle class.</i>

35:06.472 --> 35:09.272
<i>His record on social issues</i>

35:09.274 --> 35:11.508
<i>Really resonates</i>
<i>with young people.</i>

35:11.510 --> 35:13.477
<i>And... (giggles)</i>

35:13.479 --> 35:14.811
<i>Most importantly,</i>

35:14.813 --> 35:19.116
<i>He is freakin'</i> hot!

35:19.118 --> 35:20.684
(reporters shouting questions)

35:20.686 --> 35:23.153
(rick james' "super freak"
playing)

35:23.155 --> 35:24.554
<i>(james) I'm reporting to you</i>
<i>live from the white house,</i>

35:24.556 --> 35:26.356
<i>Where counter to earlier</i>
<i>erroneous reports</i>

35:26.358 --> 35:28.125
<i>Of olivia pope being...</i>

35:28.127 --> 35:30.360
<i>We now have two high-level</i>
<i>white house officials</i>

35:30.362 --> 35:33.763
<i>That 26-year-old</i>
<i>communications aide</i>

35:33.765 --> 35:36.800
<i>Jeannine locke is the other</i>
<i>woman in the grant affair.</i>

35:36.802 --> 35:39.369
You have to believe me.
People have to believe me.

35:39.371 --> 35:41.805
I never--none of this--
any of it--is true.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.807
I mean, yeah,
I called him hot.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.675
<i>(woman) sources say there are</i>
<i>multiple e-mails</i>

35:45.677 --> 35:47.410
<i>From jeannine to friends</i>

35:47.412 --> 35:49.613
<i>Detailing her strong feelings</i>
<i>for the president.</i>

35:49.615 --> 35:52.582
My name, my picture
are all over the tv.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.584
My private e-mails.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.419
Do I need a lawyer, cy?

35:56.421 --> 35:59.689
<i>"super awesome," "super cool,"</i>
<i>and "super doable"--</i>

35:59.691 --> 36:01.658
<i>Just a few of the adjectives</i>
<i>locke used in e-mails</i>

36:01.660 --> 36:03.527
<i>To describe the president.</i>

36:03.529 --> 36:04.828
Guilty people call lawyers.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.830
The white house
will handle this.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.332
I personally
will handle this.

36:09.334 --> 36:10.867
<i>(james) ...With multiple</i>
<i>sources also confirming</i>

36:10.869 --> 36:12.636
<i>Jeannine locke</i>
<i>and the president</i>

36:12.638 --> 36:15.672
<i>Had what they describe as,</i>
<i>quote, "a brief fling"...</i>

36:15.674 --> 36:18.542
You're not alone in this.
We're all here for you.

36:18.544 --> 36:20.377
You're part of the family.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.712
<i>(james) ...Those sources</i>
<i>at the same time denying</i>

36:22.714 --> 36:24.548
<i>That olivia pope had</i>
<i>any form</i>

36:24.550 --> 36:26.316
<i>Of inappropriate relationship</i>
<i>with the president.</i>

36:26.318 --> 36:30.187
<i>One thing is clear--</i>
<i>olivia pope is owed an apology.</i>

36:30.189 --> 36:32.355
Leading every net.
Of course it is.

36:32.357 --> 36:35.458
¶ that girl's all right
with me ¶

36:35.460 --> 36:38.228
<i>What</i> did you do?

36:38.230 --> 36:39.796
¶ yeah

36:39.798 --> 36:41.798
¶ hey, hey, hey, hey

36:44.336 --> 36:50.507
Calm down, honey.
What the hell is going on?
What the hell did cyrus do?

36:50.509 --> 36:51.975
What the hell did he do
to that poor, innocent girl?

36:51.977 --> 36:53.410
Jeannine?
She's a kid!

36:53.412 --> 36:54.811
What did he do?
It doesn't make any sense.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.513
We have a press conference
scheduled.

36:56.515 --> 36:58.815
You and I need to get out to
the rose garden in 20 minutes.

36:58.817 --> 37:00.784
And then we have to amend
our statements?

37:00.786 --> 37:02.586
We should call
the speechwriters,

37:02.588 --> 37:03.954
See if we can get them
to change these remarks

37:03.956 --> 37:05.522
So it's clear
that it wasn't jeannine.

37:05.524 --> 37:08.458
I don't think so.
What?

37:08.460 --> 37:10.360
You could go out there
and say that it wasn't jeannine,

37:10.362 --> 37:11.628
That it was olivia.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.997
You could say someone
must have made a mistake,

37:13.999 --> 37:15.365
Gotten the story wrong.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.434
You could.
I won't be with you.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.803
Cyrus won't stand by you.
The democrats would love that.

37:19.805 --> 37:21.871
They'd open up
a special investigation,

37:21.873 --> 37:24.341
Dig through every e-mail,
every promotion,

37:24.343 --> 37:25.942
Every late-night call log
from the oval,

37:25.944 --> 37:27.544
And then you'd get impeached.

37:27.546 --> 37:30.347
Why are you so happy
to jump on cyrus' plan

37:30.349 --> 37:33.883
"cyrus' plan." no.
See, leaking jeannine's name

37:33.885 --> 37:35.518
Was my plan.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.654
It was this <i>crazy</i> idea
I got from you.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.422
From me?
Mm.

37:39.424 --> 37:42.259
What?
After you leaked
olivia's name.

37:47.398 --> 37:49.633
(exhales)

37:51.269 --> 37:53.403
The upsetting thing about
being as educated as I am

37:53.405 --> 37:56.573
And as intelligent as I am
is that being first lady

37:56.575 --> 37:59.442
Is profoundly boring.

37:59.444 --> 38:02.412
What did you call me?
Ornamental? Not functional?

38:02.414 --> 38:04.447
I am a rose
dying on the vine here.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.783
Give me a war to run
or the c.I.A.

38:06.785 --> 38:09.452
Or something, but...

38:09.454 --> 38:13.857
I use the copious amounts
of free time I have to <i>think.</i>

38:13.859 --> 38:15.525
And I have been thinking--

38:15.527 --> 38:18.295
Who could have possibly
leaked that name, and why?

38:18.297 --> 38:19.596
And then I realized--

38:19.598 --> 38:22.432
Who would benefit the most?

38:22.434 --> 38:24.501
My idealistic,

38:24.503 --> 38:27.370
Romantic, optimistic,

38:27.372 --> 38:29.839
Idiotic husband.

38:32.076 --> 38:33.410
Sir?

38:33.412 --> 38:36.479
Shut the door, tom.
I need a favor.

38:36.481 --> 38:39.516
You want another drink?
You're buying.

38:39.518 --> 38:41.718
(indistinct conversations)

38:45.856 --> 38:47.791
Good thing he's off
tomorrow, huh?

38:47.793 --> 38:49.392
No way, tommy.

38:49.394 --> 38:51.027
Who's this trusted advisor?

38:51.029 --> 38:52.896
Mm... (chuckles)

38:52.898 --> 38:54.497
(inhales)

38:56.067 --> 38:58.802
Just between me and you,
right?

38:59.804 --> 39:01.538
It's olivia pope.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.774
You thought if you leaked
olivia's name

39:04.776 --> 39:06.776
And then I stood next to you
and held your hand

39:06.778 --> 39:08.578
And smiled while you told
the press everything you did,

39:08.580 --> 39:10.380
That it would neutralize
the situation.

39:10.382 --> 39:14.584
Stop looking for a way out
and look for a way through?

39:14.586 --> 39:16.586
Get me to play the good wife,
control me,

39:16.588 --> 39:18.455
And by extension, the nation,

39:18.457 --> 39:20.090
Because--and here's
the best part--

39:20.092 --> 39:21.491
You still somehow believe

39:21.493 --> 39:23.059
The country will eventually
embrace you

39:23.061 --> 39:26.096
Bringing your whore into
the white house as first lady.

39:26.098 --> 39:29.833
And step one--
leaking live's name. (scoffs)

39:30.835 --> 39:33.002
No.

39:33.004 --> 39:35.472
Step one...

39:35.474 --> 39:38.508
Was me to coming blair house
and laying my head in your lap

39:38.510 --> 39:40.944
<i>Like a gave a damn about</i>
<i>your forgiveness.</i>

39:40.946 --> 39:43.847
This is a war, mellie.
You and I are at war.

39:43.849 --> 39:46.449
What happened today is just
one battle of many.

39:46.451 --> 39:47.584
And let's be clear.

39:47.586 --> 39:49.886
The reason I leaked liv's name

39:49.888 --> 39:51.588
Is because as long as you had
her name

39:51.590 --> 39:55.091
In your arsenal of weapons,
olivia was at your mercy.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.626
Now she is free.

40:11.509 --> 40:13.009
Right now

40:13.011 --> 40:14.577
You're good.

40:14.579 --> 40:17.080
You're golden.

40:17.082 --> 40:19.716
You're in the clear, liv.

40:22.153 --> 40:23.820
There is nothing wrong

40:23.822 --> 40:26.523
With a little
self-preservation.

40:27.691 --> 40:29.959
Doesn't mean
you don't wear the white hat.

40:31.829 --> 40:34.864
We've got a client.
Let's get to work.

40:39.737 --> 40:41.971
It's cyrus again, jeannine.
Just trying to catch you.

40:41.973 --> 40:44.707
I know you must be scared,
but just hold tight.

40:44.709 --> 40:46.776
We'll get this
whole thing straightened.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.646
(gun cocks, switch clicks)

40:51.582 --> 40:54.851
Ooh. Sorry. Shoes on the covers.
How rude of me.

40:54.853 --> 40:56.820
Did you... Is he...

40:56.822 --> 40:59.222
Dead? (chuckles) no.

40:59.224 --> 41:01.191
He's just taking a little
drug-induced nappy.

41:01.193 --> 41:03.726
Baby's out, too.
Didn't have to drug her.

41:03.728 --> 41:05.728
That fancy swing you got
in there's worth every penny.

41:05.730 --> 41:07.163
What do you want, charlie?

41:07.165 --> 41:09.566
It's not what I want.
You know how I work.

41:09.568 --> 41:13.203
Always serving
a higher purpose.

41:13.205 --> 41:14.571
(door creaks)

41:14.573 --> 41:18.208
(water dripping faintly)

41:18.210 --> 41:19.876
I would have called,
but I couldn't risk

41:19.878 --> 41:21.878
Secret service being
anywhere near

41:21.880 --> 41:24.814
The conversation
we're about to have.

41:24.816 --> 41:27.083
Trunk was very comfortable,
thank you.

41:27.085 --> 41:29.586
Thumbprint, please.
(taps)

41:29.588 --> 41:30.854
I need to break the seal
on this, and I can't

41:30.856 --> 41:33.156
Until I raise
your security clearance.

41:33.158 --> 41:36.259
(beeps, whirs)
other hand.

41:36.261 --> 41:38.728
(whirs)
and your signature.

41:39.730 --> 41:41.064
So...

41:41.066 --> 41:42.232
(whirs)
charlie...

41:42.234 --> 41:47.237
When the republic is in danger,
there's no place for spite.

41:47.239 --> 41:49.539
If you're talking about
the president's affair

41:49.541 --> 41:51.074
With olivia--
this is bigger than that.

41:51.076 --> 41:54.244
What do you know...
About operation remington?

41:54.246 --> 41:56.713
Only that it was a classified
mission that fitz flew

41:56.715 --> 41:59.849
With jake ballard in iran
back when they were in the navy.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.184
Most of it's redacted.

42:01.186 --> 42:02.585
This...
(folder lands on table)

42:02.587 --> 42:05.188
Is what really happened
on that mission.

42:07.791 --> 42:09.559
(seal tears)

42:19.603 --> 42:21.638
Oh, my god.

42:22.606 --> 42:23.973
(gasps)

42:23.975 --> 42:25.642
(projector and camera shutter
clicks)
