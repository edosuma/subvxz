Crap!
Go, sweeties.

This is not a day
for you to be late.

I-I'll bring the fire *

* Make you come alive
I can take you higher *

I must now remind you *

Let it rock *

- Hey, Lauren.
- Hey.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.521
- [sighs]
- [girl] There's Payson.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.693
Um, could I have your autograph
for show and tell?

01:33.594 --> 01:35.663
What? Oh. Sure.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.601
Thank you.

01:42.903 --> 01:45.239
- How's the back?
- Feels good today.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.607
I'm not gonna push it
till Boston, though.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.243
We're gonna dominate in Boston.

01:49.277 --> 01:51.479
We have to.
It's our last Nationals.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.613
You can squeeze
another one out.

01:52.646 --> 01:53.547
I don't think my body
can handle it.

01:53.581 --> 01:58.319
- I hear that.
- Besides, I'm going to be

01:58.352 --> 02:01.522
soaking up deals and
showing off my medals.

02:01.555 --> 02:06.194
Waving in parades. Sleeping in.
Eating whatever I want.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.296
Parades? That's so cheesy.

02:08.329 --> 02:09.930
Yeah? What are you gonna do
after the Olympics?

02:09.963 --> 02:12.700
I'm going to blow
out of Boulder so fast.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.403
Move to France. Go all
jet set. Like the Beckhams.

02:15.436 --> 02:16.270
[laughs] How bout you, Pay?

02:16.304 --> 02:18.572
I'm going to focus on
winning in Boston.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.514
It's so weird.

02:26.547 --> 02:29.750
All this work and it can
all be over in just one weekend.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.456
[man] The board happy, Tanner?

02:35.489 --> 02:38.959
The board very happy.
The Rock is rolling in dough,

02:38.992 --> 02:42.463
we've got the strongest club
possible heading to Nationals.

02:42.496 --> 02:47.368
Sport Illustrated is talking
a cover on our Triple Threat.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.370
As long as the girls
stay focused.

02:49.403 --> 02:52.306
Not to mention, we're gonna have
the coach of the year...

02:53.407 --> 02:54.608
One day at a time, Tanner.

02:54.642 --> 02:58.612
Lauren!
[mouthing] Point toes!

02:58.646 --> 03:05.386
Listen up. This is your last
full practice before we fill out
our roster for Boston.

03:05.419 --> 03:08.289
We're gonna load that National
team with Rock girls,

03:08.322 --> 03:10.758
and for the fun of it,
shut out the Denver Club.

03:10.791 --> 03:15.596
After tomorrow, our team order
will be locked, and you all know
how important that is.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.799
The top three
will go as our top flight.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.370
I'm sorry, I can't come in.
I need to get Brian settled.

03:22.403 --> 03:25.406
- Go. See you at three.
- Bye.

03:34.282 --> 03:37.785
For god sakes we've been
the top three for years. 1-2-3.

03:37.818 --> 03:41.389
Well, we've actually
been 2-3-1. And 3-2-1.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.657
Whatever. I'm just saying.

03:43.691 --> 03:47.295
And let's face it, Payson's been
number one for most of the year.

03:47.328 --> 03:50.431
Whatever. I'm just saying,
we've always been the top three.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.672

[rock music plays]

04:36.744 --> 04:38.712
Marty...

04:38.746 --> 04:41.515
Yeah.
That's Emily Kmetko.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.584
She's an American
Gymnastics scholarship kid.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.419
That's the girl
you were telling me about?

04:45.453 --> 04:47.755
The one they found
on a playground?

04:47.788 --> 04:49.623
Yup. You know what?

04:51.392 --> 04:53.861
I think The Rock is the club
to beat at Nationals.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.768
[scoffs] What the hell
is that girl wearing?

05:02.903 --> 05:05.806
- Dude, she is hot.
- Yeah.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.744
- Who?
- [laughs]

05:10.778 --> 05:13.714
That one, blind man.
The one flipping across the gym.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.550
Hey. That was some
two and a half punch front.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.552
Thanks.
You're Payson Keeler, right?

05:18.586 --> 05:19.620
[Payson] Yeah.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.522
I saw you at the
Northern Open.

05:21.555 --> 05:24.492
- Oh.
- On TV, I mean.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.361
Emily. I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.096
Yeah, my mom had a thing.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.765
Let's not waste time. Tryouts
for Nationals are tomorrow.

05:31.799 --> 05:32.900
You cut it
as close as you could.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.402
She's training here?

05:35.936 --> 05:37.805
Yeah, Lauren.
She's training here.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.444
Why don't you work out
with these ladies today?

Hey.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.661
So. Where're you from?

06:00.694 --> 06:01.562
We just came
from Fresno.

06:01.595 --> 06:04.832
Fresno? What kind of
gyms are in Fresno?

06:04.865 --> 06:07.668
Um... Actually I was
working out at the Y.

06:07.701 --> 06:12.940
[chuckles] So, you were at
a public gym and now you're
training at The Rock?

06:12.973 --> 06:17.745
I see you don't have any
endorsements yet. For clothes.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.548
Or anything.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.751
Not yet.
Maybe after Nationals.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.586
[scoffs] Someone's
pretty cocky.

06:26.454 --> 06:27.555
Drill it, Payson.

Nice, Pay. Watch your chin.
You're dropping it on
the dismount.

- Wow.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.927
Yeah, she's number one
on the beam.

07:09.730 --> 07:15.202
Don't let her psych you out.
She's a little... intense.

electrolytes, you know?

Sorry. I'm addicted
to breakfast biscuits.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.761
Great. I look like
a butterball.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.830
I'm turning into
Mary fricken Lou.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.698
[Payson] Will you stop?
I'm bigger than you.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.199
[Kaylie] But
you're all muscle.

07:46.233 --> 07:49.837
What are we gonna do?
That girl could knock any
of us out of the top three.

07:49.870 --> 07:53.574
You can't waste your mental
energy thinking about anyone
else, Lo, it'll kill you.

07:53.607 --> 07:56.744
Easy for you to say.
With your new floor routine,
you're a lock.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.813
And you just smile and
flip your hair and pull it
out of your ass.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.682
Geez, I don't know
what we're gonna do.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.251
We've been through a lot
together. Us three.

08:04.284 --> 08:07.888
That girl just showed up.
We better figure it out.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.993
Use this time to work on
your problem areas.

08:13.026 --> 08:16.864
This is it, people.
Tomorrow it's for real.

08:16.897 --> 08:17.998
Can I mark it?

08:19.667 --> 08:21.268
- Yeah.
- Two feet, three inches.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.103
Exactly. You want to try one?

08:27.908 --> 08:29.610
Check it out.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.679
She's afraid of the vault.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.881
Maybe she's just
finding her groove.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.849
Hey. Why are you getting
all cuddly with her?

08:35.883 --> 08:37.751
You and I are the
vulnerable ones here.

08:37.785 --> 08:39.753
Payson hasn't wobbled
for months.

08:39.787 --> 08:42.823
Well, maybe we should
work as hard as Payson.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.959
Let's face it. When's the last
time you and I stayed late?

08:45.993 --> 08:47.961
Maybe we should
cover our asses.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.897
She just got here.

08:49.930 --> 08:53.100
We better beat her or we don't
deserve to go as top three.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.935
Well, let's not
take any chances.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.771
I say we make it as
uncomfortable for her as we can.

08:57.805 --> 09:00.741
Ice her out. We can all be
friends with her later.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.751
See? Told ya.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.755
- So sad.
- Hey...

09:14.788 --> 09:16.957
Do you guys want to
work in? Because I can...

09:20.894 --> 09:21.995
Sorry.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.707
Very nice work
today, Emily.

09:33.741 --> 09:34.775
Your mom get the
scholarship money?

09:34.808 --> 09:36.910
Yeah.
She'd be here, but...

09:36.944 --> 09:39.880
Well, I know you're
trying to get organized,

09:39.913 --> 09:43.016
but as you can see,
we're a community here.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.819
The Rock is
like a small town.

09:45.853 --> 09:49.823
And for anyone to be successful,
we find the entire family has to
be involved.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.962
You homeschool and you've
got to pass your grade exam.

09:54.995 --> 09:59.132
Absolutely no dating
during finals training.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.702
We catch you with a boy
and you're out.

10:01.735 --> 10:05.939
We all work way too hard on your
behalf to watch you toss it
away. You understand? OK.

10:05.973 --> 10:09.409
Your mom, she's gotta put
in time at the gym. Did she
sign her parent's contract?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.144
Not yet,
but she will.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.681
All right. Make sure
she brings it when
she comes tomorrow.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.784
And you make sure you get
a good night's rest. Trials
start at eight am sharp.

10:19.987 --> 10:23.924
Great news. I've got reps from
Juicy Burger and that breakfast
bar coming tomorrow

10:23.957 --> 10:26.126
and I promised 'em a big day.
So do yourself a favor,

10:26.159 --> 10:28.662
play to them a little.
Flash 'em that smile

10:28.696 --> 10:30.831
and we'll get bidding wars
started before Nationals.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.099
OK, I'm gonna stay
a couple hours, though.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.901
Good idea. Just technique.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.036
Don't fatigue your
muscles too much.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.839
Don't forget, we're shooting
with Denver Style this weekend.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.041

Board meeting Thursday, right?

10:42.075 --> 10:44.144
So, I shot
all your elements,

10:44.177 --> 10:46.980
we'll go through it tonight,
frame by frame.

10:48.816 --> 10:51.651
Daddy, are they going to let
that girl compete tomorrow?

10:52.185 --> 10:54.254
She's only been here
one day.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.733
- [car alarm beeps]
- Hey, girl. What's up?

11:05.766 --> 11:07.067
My dad'll be right out.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.969
Are you excited about
the big contest tomorrow?

11:09.002 --> 11:11.238
It's not a contest,
it's a competition.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.940
Daddy, your
secretary's here.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.775
Oh, executive assistant.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.177
- Whatever.
- Thanks. Perfect.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.912
Hey, nice bling by the way.

11:18.946 --> 11:22.783
Oh, thank you.
My boyfriend gave it to me.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.852
I thought Jesus
was your boyfriend.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.856
You really need to
tell her about us.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.258
After tomorrow.
I promise.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.860
You really like it?

11:32.893 --> 11:34.161
I absolutely love it!

11:34.194 --> 11:36.496
There's more
where that came from.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.899
Well, I'm not
just after your money.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.802
You must be crazier
than I thought.

11:41.835 --> 11:46.006
So, how did it go today, Payson?
Your floor looked gorgeous.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.808
Mom? Do you mind?

11:47.841 --> 11:51.011
I don't want to be mean,
but I've really go to focus.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.679
I'll catch up with you
after tomorrow.

11:52.712 --> 11:56.884
When Payson makes a million
dollars from Wheaties or
whatever, can we get a new car?

11:56.917 --> 11:58.518
I suppose
that's up to Payson.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.921
But don't bother her now.
She's focusing.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.958
Listen, Little Miss.

12:04.992 --> 12:07.761
You can chillax all the way
home, then you'll do chores,

12:07.795 --> 12:11.098
help with dinner, and
communicate with your family

12:11.131 --> 12:14.301
in something other than
a tribal grunting language.

13:41.421 --> 13:44.892
I got it. I deserve it.
I'm gonna cook dinner.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.194
Tell me when you
want to speak to me again.

13:49.229 --> 13:52.632
...and they only mainstream
one day a week, which, as I
reminded him,

13:52.665 --> 13:55.969
is probably against the law
in this state.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.938
How did Erin Brockovich
go over?

13:57.971 --> 14:00.273
It was a love connection.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.976
Yeah, mom. I'm sure
he appreciated that,

14:03.010 --> 14:06.646
coming from someone who'd been
in Colorado all of... 24 hours?

14:06.679 --> 14:09.917
Yeah, apparently not so much,
because then he asked if

14:09.950 --> 14:11.885
"maybe he could
speak with my husband."

14:11.919 --> 14:14.021
- Oh no he di-n't.
- Mm-hm.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.889
He walked right into it.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.891
Yeah, he thought I was
a pain in the rear before,

14:17.925 --> 14:19.927
he hadn't seen
anything yet.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.896
All right, sit down. Um...

14:22.930 --> 14:25.365
Tomorrow we have the
Social Services interview,

14:25.398 --> 14:26.900
then we have to finish
the school paperwork...

14:26.934 --> 14:29.436
Mom, National Trials
are tomorrow.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.906
Tomorrow tomorrow?

14:32.940 --> 14:34.374
Yeah. And you
have to be there.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.944
This is the biggest shot
I'm ever gonna have.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.445
I'm training at
The Rock now,

14:38.478 --> 14:41.381
that automatically puts me
in contention for everything.

14:42.950 --> 14:46.053
Right, right. Crap. Um...
I'm sorry, I just...

14:46.086 --> 14:47.687
I thought that was Friday.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.323
OK, deep breath.
It's gonna be OK.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.459
We're just gonna have to
move some stuff around.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.694
It's fine. [sighs]

14:54.727 --> 14:59.933
We just haven't gotten
the security deposit check
back, and...

14:59.967 --> 15:01.368
...the end of
the month is coming.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.136
I know. I'm on it.

15:03.170 --> 15:06.940
I already called the Pizza
Shack and I'm going to pick up
my uniform and stuff tonight.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.375
Already, honey?

15:11.979 --> 15:14.982
Well, once I get Brian settled,
I'll find a job.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.083
I know you will.

15:16.116 --> 15:20.420
You are gonna be the Acrylic
Nails Queen of Boulder.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.489
And not a moment too soon.

15:22.522 --> 15:25.292
Have you seen the paws on some
of these mountain women?

15:25.325 --> 15:28.928
And apparently, waxing
is a foreign concept.

15:45.545 --> 15:49.382
Look, I think,
after Nationals,

15:49.416 --> 15:51.751
I should just talk to your
father, man to man.

15:51.784 --> 15:55.488
- No. Forget it!
- Listen, Kaylie, I'm 18.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.524
We've been together a year.
We have plans...

15:57.557 --> 16:00.393
You're not listening.
If he finds out about us,

16:00.427 --> 16:01.728
Dad will kill you.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.998
No, no. Really.
Like, blood and cops

16:05.032 --> 16:08.068
and teddy-bears-and
candles-on-the-sidewalk
kill you.

16:09.502 --> 16:12.439
I'm not afraid of him. He
doesn't own you, you know.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.409
Will you do it for me?

16:16.443 --> 16:19.379
Just lay low
a little while longer for me?

16:19.412 --> 16:21.014
Please? I'm under
so much pressure...

16:21.048 --> 16:24.151
It's OK... It's OK.
[groans]

16:24.184 --> 16:27.287
I just hate sneaking around.
I want this to be real.

16:27.320 --> 16:32.125
It is real. It's the
realest thing in my life.

16:32.159 --> 16:35.262

16:42.069 --> 16:43.103
Hey, Kaylie.

16:43.136 --> 16:46.039
Hey. Lauren.
What are you doing here?

16:46.073 --> 16:49.242
I came to see you.
What are you guys up to?

16:49.276 --> 16:52.379
- Oh, he...
- I guess you already
have company.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.181
He was just giving me
a ride, Lauren.

16:56.816 --> 16:59.786
- Thanks for the lift.
- No worries.
Is your brother here?

16:59.819 --> 17:01.221
Yeah. Inside.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.124
Good luck next week
in the men's finals, Carter.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.093
Yeah. Good luck tomorrow.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.798
I don't mean to get up in your
Kool-Aid, but watch your butt.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.366
Marty will wig
if he catches you two.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.369
He was just giving me a ride,
Lauren! That's all!

17:17.170 --> 17:18.338
Right. OK...

17:18.371 --> 17:19.806
Check this out!

17:19.839 --> 17:22.309
- Daddy got it for me.
- That's beautiful.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.576
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

17:23.610 --> 17:24.811
And I have better news.

17:24.844 --> 17:27.547
Dad says he's gonna
take care of Emily.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.083
- What do you mean
"take care of her?"
- I don't know.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.619
He said there had to be
something on her, and he
was going to find it.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.521
And you know
Marty and his rules.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.555
Yeah.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.292
Let's go inside,
It's getting cold.

17:39.326 --> 17:43.096
This was just a drive by.
Oh, hey, just to be safe,

17:43.130 --> 17:45.198
we're still
giving that girl the chill.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.666
I already warned everyone.

17:50.470 --> 17:53.140
I really can't start tonight,
I just came to pick up my...

17:53.173 --> 17:57.110
It's just a few hours. I can't
believe you worked at Pizza
Shacks in Phoenix and Fresno.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.545
You're a flipping godsend.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.481
You want the job?

18:03.683 --> 18:05.452
I'm gonna need
a couple at the till.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.421
OK.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.291
[rock music plays]

18:23.170 --> 18:27.240
OK. I want a calzone.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.209
Sausage, mushroom, onion.

18:29.242 --> 18:34.314
There's like a million
kajillion carbs in that.

18:34.347 --> 18:37.550
Oh. Right...

18:37.584 --> 18:41.721
OK, can I...
Let me think.

18:43.523 --> 18:47.694
[gasping] OK, make that
an open faced calzone.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.696
That'd be a pizza.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.166
- Right!
- [both laughing]

How ya holding up, Ace?

19:02.975 --> 19:06.679
- I haven't killed anyone yet.
- The night is still young.

19:06.713 --> 19:11.351
Not for me. I was supposed to
be off by ten. Where's Suzie?

19:11.384 --> 19:17.290
Ahh. See, there's good stuff
and bad stuff about having a
meth head for a manager.

19:17.324 --> 19:22.595
On the plus side, tons of
freedom. Down side, chaos.

19:22.629 --> 19:25.632
Kind of the same thing, though,
if you think about it.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.734
Perfect. Sounds like
the rest of my life.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.703
Yeah, Mine too.

19:30.737 --> 19:34.707
So, you've been great tonight.
Seriously. You rock the Shack.

19:35.975 --> 19:39.512
Gee thanks. [laughs]
You too.

19:39.546 --> 19:43.383
Sounds kind of stupid but I
actually appreciate someone
who comes here to work.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.951
Yeah.

19:44.984 --> 19:47.220
I figure if you
gotta be here

19:47.254 --> 19:48.755
you might as well
be here, right?

19:48.788 --> 19:50.790
Show up, do it.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.695
So. What are you into?
You like music?

19:55.728 --> 19:59.499
Yeah, you know.
Just livin'. [chuckles]

20:01.268 --> 20:03.670
Haven't quite figured out
your thing yet, huh?

20:05.004 --> 20:06.205
Not yet.

20:07.740 --> 20:11.478
Well, uh...
I do a little singing myself.

20:11.511 --> 20:15.248
- Emo. You like Emo?
- Sure.

20:15.282 --> 20:19.252
There's this open mic thing
tonight, if you wanna come.

20:20.620 --> 20:24.724
Just friends. Just hanging out.
I think you're cool, that's all.

20:24.757 --> 20:29.696

I could intro you to some
of my peeps. [humming]

get going home.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.637

to do in the morning.

Yeah. [clears throat]

20:44.711 --> 20:46.646
But I'm working Saturday?

20:46.679 --> 20:49.015
Nice. Me too.

20:49.048 --> 20:53.052
I will see you then... then.

[both laughing]

20:58.558 --> 20:59.792
Was your boss OK?

20:59.826 --> 21:02.662
Yeah. I got a boatload
of vacation days.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.564
Girls! Come on!

21:04.597 --> 21:05.732
So, how's Payson.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.833
Oh, well,
you know Payson.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.736
Totally controlled.
Totally focused.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.705
- Becca, totally unfocused.
- Yeah.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.307
I know we said we'd stop
asking this...

21:14.341 --> 21:16.309
That's never stopped us...

21:16.343 --> 21:20.313
Do you still wonder if we
did the right thing by making
this our whole lives?

21:20.347 --> 21:21.781
Is it fair to Becca?

21:21.814 --> 21:25.852
All the time. Sometimes I wonder
if it's fair to Payson.

21:25.885 --> 21:29.356
I thought the big drama
with our kid would be things
like the prom.

21:31.558 --> 21:33.693
- Remember our prom?
- Yeah.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.595
I think that's how
we got the kid.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.769

call with Bruce Jenner that
you're not telling me about.

I thought I'd let you
get some sleep.

Are you kidding me?
We're not gonna make it!

22:09.161 --> 22:10.162
Come on.
That's a little dramatic.

22:10.196 --> 22:13.533
Dramatic? This is
the biggest day of my life.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.101
I was doing you a favor.

Honey, you just go go go.
Somebody needs to
take care of you.

want to do me a favor?

me next time, OK? Come on!

Well, It's weird for her
to just not to show up.

this isn't her kind of place.

* Aah, aah-ah

25:47.880 --> 25:51.784
* Aah, aah

25:51.818 --> 25:52.852
[straining]

25:54.854 --> 25:56.088
[audience groans]

26:10.069 --> 26:12.071
[audience applauding]

26:24.784 --> 26:25.918
[applause]

26:30.122 --> 26:31.791
[mouthing]

26:36.829 --> 26:38.898
[announcer]
Emily Kmetko is next on beam.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.167
I can't believe
Lauren ate mat on beam.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.737
Holy shizzle. She has
a shot at the top three.

26:44.771 --> 26:47.006
She deserves a shot.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.607
Drill it, Emily.

26:53.913 --> 26:56.015
Come on, Emily. Get it.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.084
[girl] Come on,
Emily. Do it!

27:45.231 --> 27:46.833
[audience cheers]

27:55.942 --> 27:58.177
[announcer] The top three have
broken away from the pack,

27:58.210 --> 28:02.248
Emily Kmetko now solidly
in third with her outstanding
beam routine...

28:02.281 --> 28:03.850
Now onto the vault.

28:10.757 --> 28:12.124
- Dad...
- It's OK, Lauren...

28:12.158 --> 28:14.260
It's not OK!
It is so not OK!

28:14.293 --> 28:16.062
She apparently can't vault.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.998
You don't get it. If she
manages to beat me, I'm out!

28:19.031 --> 28:20.800
What are
you gonna do?

28:20.833 --> 28:22.802
I don't know
what I'm gonna do,

28:22.835 --> 28:25.872
but you need to go out there
and have the vault
of your damn life.

28:29.942 --> 28:32.244
[announcer] With the first of
her two vaults, Payson Keeler.

28:32.278 --> 28:34.914
Payson Keeler.
Two feet, six inches.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.284
[announcer] This is the hardest
vault we will see today,

28:38.317 --> 28:41.153
in fact it's never been landed
in competition before.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.990
This might be a preview of
the next Olympic gold vault.

28:44.023 --> 28:46.525
You can say you saw it
first at The Rock.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.860
[applause]

29:03.542 --> 29:04.977
[cheering]

29:13.920 --> 29:17.256
[announcer] Here is Lauren
Tanner with her first vault.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.892
- [man] Get it, Lauren!
- [woman] You got it, girl!

29:33.005 --> 29:35.007
[audience cheering]

29:45.985 --> 29:48.821
[announcer] Here is Emily Kmetko
with the first of two vaults.

29:48.855 --> 29:53.826
This event will determine who
goes to Nationals from the Rock
as our top three.

30:39.138 --> 30:41.040
[gasping]

30:47.980 --> 30:49.916
Call an ambulance!
Don't touch her.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.951
Emily! Emily,
can you hear me?

30:51.984 --> 30:53.052
Emily!

30:53.085 --> 30:56.288
No ambulance.
Wind knocked out.

30:56.322 --> 30:57.890
OK, can you feel this
or does it hurt?

30:57.924 --> 30:58.991
Yes. Hurt.

30:59.025 --> 31:00.893
Hurt. Hurt better than no hurt.

31:00.927 --> 31:02.094
Hurt a helluva lot better.
How 'bout this?

31:02.128 --> 31:05.031
- [Emily] Hurt.
- What can you move?

31:05.064 --> 31:07.133
Let me see your feet. Can you
move your feet? That's great.

31:07.166 --> 31:10.036
Let's put her on a stretcher
and wait for the medics, OK?

31:10.069 --> 31:13.940
Hold her head. On my count.
1, 2, 3.

31:14.706 --> 31:15.607
No ambulance.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.409
No discussion.
You're gonna be fine, Emily.

31:21.013 --> 31:25.051
Wow. I guess she
does have vault issues.

31:30.089 --> 31:33.392
[announcer] We're going to move
on now, with the second vaults
for the senior ladies,

31:33.425 --> 31:35.427
the best of the two scores
will stand.

31:36.963 --> 31:39.198
And the second vault
for Kaylie Cruz.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.967
[audience cheers]

31:43.502 --> 31:44.937
- Good luck, Lo.
- Thanks.

31:44.971 --> 31:47.106
Looks like the Triple Threat
rocks again.

31:49.976 --> 31:50.977
Yeah.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.949
Look, just relax.
We'll get you to the hospital.

31:56.983 --> 31:58.217
They might have cute doctors.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.486
I don't want to go
to the hospital.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.354
I want to go
to Nationals.

32:02.388 --> 32:05.958
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

32:05.992 --> 32:07.960
We'll just get you
better for next year.

32:07.994 --> 32:10.396
What's the point?

32:10.429 --> 32:13.966
Things never get better
"next year."

32:14.000 --> 32:16.735
I'm not like them.

32:16.768 --> 32:21.040
I don't belong here.
I don't belong anywhere.

32:21.073 --> 32:23.709
Honey, you just got a bad break.
Bad breaks happen.

32:23.742 --> 32:27.513
Have you ever wondered why
they keep happening to us?

32:27.546 --> 32:32.985
It's not your fault.
You've been so good.

32:33.019 --> 32:34.253
So good.

32:37.023 --> 32:40.526
But it was kind
of a long shot, wasn't it?

32:40.559 --> 32:43.996
I mean, it's a wonderful dream.

32:44.030 --> 32:45.731
But not everybody
can be an Olympian.

32:45.764 --> 32:48.200
You know? It's a lot
of pressure, right?

32:48.234 --> 32:50.736
Maybe it's time you have
some fun. How does that sound?

32:50.769 --> 32:53.739
You know, you can go
to a real school again.

32:53.772 --> 32:55.407
Are you saying
I should give up?

32:55.441 --> 32:58.277
I don't know what to say
right now, Emily.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.012
I'm throwing out
everything I got.

33:00.046 --> 33:02.048
You're always telling
Brian not to quit.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.016
You're always telling him
that he should keep going.

33:04.050 --> 33:08.587
You're just such a strong young
woman, Emily. Brian needs me.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.260
But maybe you need me too?

33:14.293 --> 33:16.062
Would that be so bad?

33:18.130 --> 33:22.801
I know I'm not gonna be mom of
the year, but you know how
much I love you, right?

33:22.834 --> 33:24.470
[announcer] And here's Lauren
Tanner's final vault.

33:24.503 --> 33:27.406
- The final skill of the day.
- [audience cheering]

33:27.439 --> 33:33.412
So I'm here for you now.
Tell me what you need
from me right now.

33:33.445 --> 33:37.449
[footsteps running, vaulting]

33:38.450 --> 33:40.386
[audience cheering]

33:42.088 --> 33:46.192
This is my shot.
Tell me I can do this.

33:46.225 --> 33:51.330
Are you kidding?
You can do anything you want.

33:51.363 --> 33:54.566
But it's the vault.
You're hurt already.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.136
Emily, the ambulance is here.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.574
Are you OK?
Tell me the truth.

34:04.843 --> 34:06.044
Yeah.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.382
You can do this.

34:12.851 --> 34:14.453
Now go get it, Emily.

34:16.122 --> 34:19.525
No, Emily, don't move.
Emily, sit down.
Emily, sit down!

34:19.558 --> 34:23.195
Get out of my way.
Or you're gonna have
to deal with my mother.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.100
I'd get out
of her way.

34:29.835 --> 34:33.639
[announcer] Because of the
unfortunate scratch of Emily
Kmetko, it looks like the top...

34:33.672 --> 34:35.574
All right. Yeah! Yeah!

34:35.607 --> 34:38.377
[announcer] ...Payson Keeler,
Kaylie Cruz and Lauren Tanner.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.512
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I want my second vault.

34:40.546 --> 34:43.382
- What?
- I want my vault.

34:43.415 --> 34:47.653
Look. See? I'm fine.
I want my vault.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.421
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.864
I can't endorse this.

34:58.897 --> 35:01.233
But I can't keep you
from this either.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.901
This is your career.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.236
I'm gonna do it.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.439
- Let her vault.
- What?!

35:09.941 --> 35:12.144
I'm gonna set the
board myself this time.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.314
[hip-hop music plays]

35:41.507 --> 35:45.143
That's my girl.
She kicks ass.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.732
[audience cheering]

37:06.692 --> 37:10.396
Marty, what the... What just...
How could this happen?

37:10.429 --> 37:15.434
Save it. Calm down.
No one, and I mean no one
saw that coming.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.572
- [indistinct chattering]
- You did great.
This is so cool!

37:20.606 --> 37:23.709
I can't believe this!
I've been training at
this gym for five years!

37:23.742 --> 37:25.711
It's a competition.
You know that.

37:25.744 --> 37:28.680
I've been in the top three for
two years. This is my life.

37:28.714 --> 37:30.682
And you'll go fourth.
It'll be fine.

37:30.716 --> 37:34.420
[Marty]
Who knows, a lot can happen
between now and Nationals.

37:34.453 --> 37:36.822
What about a contract
infraction?

37:36.855 --> 37:38.724
What are you talking about?

37:38.757 --> 37:40.826
- Kaylie's seeing Carter!
- Lo! Don't!

37:40.859 --> 37:43.462
- Kaylie, is that true?
- No. No, it's not.

37:43.495 --> 37:44.730
Ask them where
they were yesterday.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.865
Ask the coaches if they were
here like they said!

37:47.733 --> 37:48.834
I... We...

37:48.867 --> 37:51.036
See! Where were you
yesterday, Kaylie?

37:51.069 --> 37:52.438
Where were you
and Carter?

37:52.471 --> 37:53.705
[Emily] She was with me.

37:54.873 --> 37:56.608
She was not!
She doesn't even like you!

37:56.642 --> 37:59.711
She was with me. She was helping
me with some homeschool stuff.

37:59.745 --> 38:03.615
Then Carter asked us
both if we wanted a ride,
but I was waiting for my mom.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.786
Kaylie?

38:09.888 --> 38:13.692
Yeah, I was, um, I was just
giving her my tests and stuff.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.503
Lauren, I know
you're disappointed,

38:24.536 --> 38:27.806
but quite frankly,
I'm disappointed in you.
The order is set.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.775
Send the roster to Nationals.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.879
I guess it's us three.

38:33.912 --> 38:37.649
Yeah. I guess.

38:42.654 --> 38:43.455
Thanks.

38:45.857 --> 38:48.827
- I'm gonna take care of it.
- [grunts]

39:08.480 --> 39:12.651
- All right, gimme five.
Give me some love. All right!
- [laughing]

39:12.684 --> 39:15.654
- You were so great today.
- Oh my God.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.756
- Nice work today, Kaylie.
- Thanks!

39:22.428 --> 39:24.563
So you sure
you don't belong here?

39:31.837 --> 39:33.839
You must be pretty
disappointed, huh, Steve?

39:33.872 --> 39:36.174
[chuckles]
You could say that.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.777
It's not the end of the world,
to go fourth. Lauren will...

39:38.810 --> 39:40.812
Cut the crap, Marty.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.814
After all my family has
put into this gym.

39:42.848 --> 39:46.184
Making it a success,
making you a success.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.687
And, we're grateful.

39:48.720 --> 39:52.691
Sometimes things just don't work
out the way we expect them to.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.427
Right. Funny thing,

39:55.461 --> 40:00.966
I wasn't sure about this
Kmetko girl, so I hired a PI.

40:00.999 --> 40:03.835
You hired a PI
to trail a little girl?

40:03.869 --> 40:05.771
Wow, that's pretty
desperate there, Steve.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.639
They're not little girls.

40:07.673 --> 40:09.775
- They're big business.
You know it.
- For Pete's sake...

40:09.808 --> 40:11.843
I'm a lawyer.
I use PIs all the time.

40:11.877 --> 40:17.649
Anyway, when I told my guy
about the gym, whatever,

40:18.550 --> 40:19.885
he seemed to
know who you were.

40:20.819 --> 40:21.853
What are you talking about?

40:40.539 --> 40:41.673
What is it you want?

40:42.641 --> 40:43.575
OK.

40:43.609 --> 40:47.479
I just got off the phone
with the Denver Club.

40:47.513 --> 40:50.882
They are very interested
in your coaching services.

40:50.916 --> 40:53.018
And you won't be alone.
You're taking Lauren,

40:53.051 --> 40:56.221
plus your fourth
through seventh ranked girls.

40:56.254 --> 40:59.758
I've already talked to
their parents. They think
it's a wonderful opportunity.

40:59.791 --> 41:04.896
That ought to put a nice dent
in The Rock. This place will
sink without us.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.932
Oh, and Marty.

41:06.965 --> 41:11.503
At Denver, could you be sure
Lauren goes in the top three?

41:12.538 --> 41:13.672
Thanks, pal.

41:22.681 --> 41:23.649
[shouts]

41:23.682 --> 41:24.850
Mark Keeler? KSQT Boulder.

41:24.883 --> 41:27.653
Your daughter is our big Olympic
hope. Can we talk to her?

41:27.686 --> 41:30.956
Oh, I have a feeling things
are really gonna change
around here.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.791
Not if I can help it.
Thank you! See ya.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.526
- [man] Mr. Keeler. Mr. Keeler.
- Bye bye. Thank you.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.828
- [woman] One more question...
- [reporters chattering]

41:40.566 --> 41:42.267
Hey. What's going on?

41:42.300 --> 41:45.837
- You're not gonna believe it.
- Marty left the club.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.539
Right before Nationals.

41:47.573 --> 41:49.808
Marty would never leave us!

41:49.841 --> 41:52.944
Not just him. The Tanners, the
Morgan girls, and Maddie Welles.

41:52.978 --> 41:56.548
Yeah, this is a gutting.
Our whole second flight
is gone.

41:56.582 --> 41:58.617
- Fourth through Seventh.
- That son of a bitch.

41:58.650 --> 42:02.988
Well, looks like you're going to
Nationals, honey. You're 17th.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.022
Me?

42:05.591 --> 42:06.992
- Oh, Sweetie...
- Hey!

42:07.025 --> 42:09.695
Steve! What the hell are
you doing? Put those down.

42:09.728 --> 42:11.963
Just taking the files
that belong to Marty, Alex.

42:13.932 --> 42:15.667
[Steve]
Good luck, folks.

42:15.701 --> 42:18.904
This is low, Steve,
even for you.

42:18.937 --> 42:20.739
[Payson] Hey!

42:20.772 --> 42:21.973
Wait a minute.
Wait a damn minute!

42:22.007 --> 42:23.108
Payson?

42:23.141 --> 42:24.776
I did everything right!

42:24.810 --> 42:28.079
Everything! I haven't had a
weekend off my whole childhood.

42:28.113 --> 42:31.683
And my coach just...
leaves? Now?

42:31.717 --> 42:32.851
It's OK.
It's gonna be OK.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.653
No, It's not OK, Mom.

42:34.686 --> 42:38.023
What the hell is happening?
I did everything right.

42:43.795 --> 42:46.898
Hey. So, what?
This is goodbye?

42:46.932 --> 42:49.334
Don't look at me.
If the rules were enforced,

42:49.367 --> 42:53.138
it should've been me in top
three and not you. You know it.

42:53.171 --> 42:56.842
Congratulations Emily.
One lucky day and you
blew our gym to pieces.

42:56.875 --> 42:59.010
I'm sure everyone is
just loving you now.

42:59.044 --> 43:01.046
[Lauren sighs] Oh...

43:01.079 --> 43:04.015
You might have these people
fooled, but I have your number.

43:04.049 --> 43:06.652
You have no consistency.

43:06.685 --> 43:09.354
I'm gonna make sure you get
buried in Boston.

43:09.387 --> 43:10.856
Lo, come on!

43:10.889 --> 43:12.157
Save it.

43:12.190 --> 43:14.760
Now you're all left
with no coach.

43:14.793 --> 43:17.929
Right before Nationals.
Good luck.

43:22.100 --> 43:23.935
So what
do we do now?

43:23.969 --> 43:25.971
