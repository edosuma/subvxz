WEBVTT

01:15.325 --> 01:18.265
Kim Young Joo... Kim Young Joo!

02:07.455 --> 02:10.814
This is SukJooDong Officetel*, Parking
Level 3. (*office and apartment building).

02:10.815 --> 02:13.116
There's a man passed out here.

02:13.755 --> 02:15.425
Yeah.

02:26.105 --> 02:28.685
- Boss, did something happen?
- Why?

02:28.695 --> 02:31.815
I think there's an intruder.
The security men are knocked out.

02:31.845 --> 02:32.545
What?

02:32.546 --> 02:35.985
I called security from all the other floors,
but should I call the cops as well?

02:36.015 --> 02:37.215
It's fine.

02:37.295 --> 02:39.541
Don't make a huge scene
and just investigate what happened.

02:39.542 --> 02:41.905
Check the CCTV camera footage
and find out who it is!

02:41.915 --> 02:43.255
Yes, Sir.

02:51.555 --> 02:54.625
It seems City Hunter was here.

02:56.315 --> 02:58.585
But you're too late.

02:58.835 --> 03:02.395
Operation Clean Sweep from 1983...

03:03.163 --> 03:05.429
is going to be buried.

03:21.225 --> 03:26.475
The one given to Chairman Chun was a copy
and this is the original.

03:32.875 --> 03:36.565
I put the money, in cash,
inside the car's trunk.

03:38.015 --> 03:42.705
I'm telling you in case
it will be of some help.

03:42.945 --> 03:46.425
But a prosecutor from the
Seoul Prosecutor's Office...

03:46.485 --> 03:48.185
requested several times
to see that document.

03:48.235 --> 03:53.035
By any chance,
is the prosecutor's name Kim Young Joo?

03:53.045 --> 03:54.594
You already knew.

03:54.595 --> 03:58.032
Yes, he said his name
is Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

04:04.305 --> 04:06.095
[Father]

04:10.155 --> 04:11.525
What do you need?

04:11.535 --> 04:13.475
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo knows...

04:13.485 --> 04:19.415
about the incident that occurred
off Nampo Port in 1983, and came to see me.

04:19.425 --> 04:22.425
He also figured out that I'm Lee Jin Pyo.

04:22.625 --> 04:24.675
<i>Basically, he has uncovered our background.</i>

04:24.685 --> 04:26.795
<i>You better be careful as well.</i>

04:26.805 --> 04:30.695
Kim Young Joo is someone
who is as big an obstacle to you as I am.

04:30.705 --> 04:35.835
I won't ever get caught,
because I'm going to protect what's mine.

04:36.695 --> 04:38.585
You dream big.

04:38.595 --> 04:43.445
As someone who risks his life every
single day, what could you possibly protect?

04:43.555 --> 04:47.235
You love
and you want to protect that love...

04:47.445 --> 04:50.155
Do you think it's going to go
the way you plan?

04:50.165 --> 04:52.375
I'm going to live.

04:52.825 --> 04:56.815
I'm going to make it out alive,
so I can protect what's mine.

04:56.825 --> 05:01.515
You pushed Kim Young Joo's father,
Kim Jong Shik, to the brink of death.

05:01.525 --> 05:04.845
Do you think Prosecutor Kim
is going to let you off the hook so easily?

05:04.855 --> 05:07.985
Even though his father is a criminal...

05:07.995 --> 05:10.505
A father is a father.

05:10.515 --> 05:12.105
Then Father,

05:12.106 --> 05:16.933
why did you leave the punishment to me
and then started approaching Chun Jae Man?

05:17.875 --> 05:19.765
I don't understand.

05:20.135 --> 05:23.425
Have you given up on revenge?

05:23.655 --> 05:28.345
Try to think of what my battle strategy is.
Even if it won't be easy.

05:32.445 --> 05:35.999
Yoon Sung, for you and I...

05:36.000 --> 05:41.200
an ordinary life, a happy life...

05:41.255 --> 05:45.285
is a life that's absolutely impossible.

05:55.035 --> 05:56.695
This person...

06:03.915 --> 06:06.265
is Chun Jae Man's man.

06:08.075 --> 06:11.195
You said you were going out for field work,
you went over to Chun Jae Man's place?

06:11.205 --> 06:14.205
Bear Na Na, why do you barge in
without notice?

06:14.215 --> 06:16.155
You didn't hear me come in?

06:16.165 --> 06:18.275
I'm working right now, leave.

06:18.285 --> 06:20.295
- Can I help you with anything...?
- No.

06:20.305 --> 06:22.700
You saw me go into a hotel room
with a woman

06:22.701 --> 06:24.024
and you still want
to get involved with this?

06:24.025 --> 06:25.831
I couldn't help but let you get involved
in the Kim Jong Shik case,

06:25.832 --> 06:27.924
but I'll handle Chun Jae Man by myself.

06:27.925 --> 06:30.585
I don't want to drag you
into this dangerous work.

06:31.405 --> 06:34.615
Do you really have to do this?

06:34.885 --> 06:38.695
No matter what you say,
I'm not going to change my mind.

06:40.425 --> 06:41.569
Well, hurry up.

06:41.570 --> 06:44.424
We're going to be late
for visiting hours to see Ahjumma.

06:44.485 --> 06:45.075
Oh.

06:45.085 --> 06:48.365
We were going to pick up Shik Joong ahjussi
on the way, when he gets discharged.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.975
Come on.

06:59.235 --> 07:00.895
Yoon Sung.

07:00.905 --> 07:02.059
Ahjussi.

07:03.045 --> 07:05.845
The hospital isn't the place for me.

07:05.855 --> 07:10.055
I was bored to death there. I couldn't stand
not having the Home Shopping Channel.

07:10.875 --> 07:13.035
Ahjussi.
Are you really okay?

07:13.045 --> 07:15.045
You don't look like
you had a near death experience.

07:15.055 --> 07:16.815
Why would I die and leave
the Home Shopping Channel behind?

07:16.825 --> 07:18.825
There are so many things
I haven't bought yet.

07:18.835 --> 07:21.175
I have to buy
those dishes made by French craftsmen.

07:21.185 --> 07:23.895
Rest here for now.
You're really okay, right?

07:23.905 --> 07:25.135
Yeah.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.895
I have to go to the hospital with Na Na
to see Mom, before visiting hours end.

07:27.905 --> 07:30.325
Okay, go ahead.

07:31.595 --> 07:34.215
Na Na, you don't look well.
Are you ill?

07:34.225 --> 07:39.935
No. Lee Yoon Sung let's hurry up.
We're going to miss visiting hours.

07:42.415 --> 07:44.795
Are you looking for something?
Should I help you?

07:44.805 --> 07:46.465
Hold on.

07:46.585 --> 07:47.945
Hey...

07:48.295 --> 07:51.215
Wow, it's two 100 won coins.

07:52.955 --> 07:54.605
You found it?

07:56.285 --> 07:58.345
Thank you.

07:58.355 --> 07:59.995
Noona is quite strong.

08:00.005 --> 08:04.875
You can pick up 100 won if you look inside
the vending machine coin return slot.

08:04.885 --> 08:08.655
Really? Are you here to visit someone?
Where's your mom?

08:08.665 --> 08:10.175
She's in the isolation room.

08:10.205 --> 08:11.095
Isolation room?

08:11.105 --> 08:13.565
We're going to an isolation room, too.
We'll see each other often in the future.

08:13.575 --> 08:14.585
What's your name?

08:14.595 --> 08:16.335
Yoon Shik. Kim Yoon Shik.

08:16.475 --> 08:18.105
Kim Yoon Shik?

08:18.395 --> 08:21.745
Why does your name sound familiar...?
Yoon Shik...

08:21.755 --> 08:23.675
Yoon... Sung?!

08:24.305 --> 08:27.055
Maybe it's because your names are similar.

08:28.295 --> 08:29.905
What are you looking at, Kid?

08:29.915 --> 08:33.044
Noona, that hyung is scary.

08:33.215 --> 08:35.955
Guardians, you can come
to the isolation rooms to visit patients.

08:35.965 --> 08:38.054
Okay.
Let's go.

08:42.934 --> 08:45.645
Ahjumma.
Are you okay?

08:45.655 --> 08:47.775
I heard chemotherapy treatment is hard.

08:47.785 --> 08:50.025
It's bearable.

08:51.065 --> 08:53.105
But Na Na,

08:53.915 --> 08:57.885
can you tell him that he's
going to stare a hole in my face?

08:58.485 --> 09:02.405
It's because he's embarrassed.
Lee Yoon Sung gets embarrassed very easily.

09:02.415 --> 09:03.955
Kim Na Na.

09:06.415 --> 09:08.035
I heard that if you're on chemotherapy,

09:08.065 --> 09:10.455
you could develop mouth sores
and lose your appetite.

09:10.515 --> 09:11.905
Are you eating well?

09:11.965 --> 09:13.765
Apparently, you've done some research.

09:13.775 --> 09:15.345
Shush.

09:15.765 --> 09:21.765
Of course, I eat well
and I'm receiving my treatment well.

09:22.635 --> 09:26.415
You two talk, I'll wait outside.

09:28.765 --> 09:31.245
Na Na is really pretty, isn't she?

09:31.745 --> 09:35.135
I've watched her grow up all these years,
so I know.

09:35.145 --> 09:37.855
She's nice, pretty...

09:37.985 --> 09:39.995
She's not pretty at all.

09:40.005 --> 09:44.375
She's meddlesome, an eating machine,
and do you know how strong she is?

09:44.385 --> 09:48.175
Earlier, she helped a kid looking for coins,
she even lifted up the whole sofa!

09:48.185 --> 09:54.185
Did you see Yoon Shik then?
Is he still going around looking for coins?

09:54.465 --> 09:56.155
Do you know him?

09:58.015 --> 10:01.905
Yoon Shik's mom has leukemia, just like me.

10:02.475 --> 10:06.435
I hear she got sick from working
at a company called Haewon Chemicals.

10:06.445 --> 10:08.985
Haewon Chemicals?

10:09.335 --> 10:12.175
That's a subsidiary of Haewon Group, right?

10:12.545 --> 10:14.485
I think so.

10:16.485 --> 10:21.345
Oh, that's right.
I have something to give you.

10:27.855 --> 10:29.655
What is this?

10:29.665 --> 10:33.295
Your father gave it to me.

10:33.655 --> 10:37.715
Give it to Na Na.

10:39.495 --> 10:40.925
We're not in that kind of relationship.

10:40.935 --> 10:44.685
Why do you act so cold and stiff
when you obviously like her?

10:50.595 --> 10:55.105
It's a happy thing to like someone.

10:55.985 --> 11:02.873
I want my Yoon Sung to be happy.

11:52.725 --> 11:54.825
Are visiting hours over?

11:54.835 --> 11:59.695
Hey, Bear Na Na,
how can you just fall asleep anywhere?

12:00.255 --> 12:02.795
Let's go.
Ahjussi is probably waiting.

12:02.875 --> 12:04.285
Um...

12:05.875 --> 12:08.415
I thought about it...

12:08.755 --> 12:13.535
I won't get involved in your work again.

12:14.765 --> 12:18.115
But, you have to be careful,

12:18.185 --> 12:22.685
more careful, and even more careful.
Okay?

12:23.375 --> 12:27.495
And if you need help, let me know any time.

12:27.545 --> 12:30.055
You know there's no partner
better than me, right?

12:33.595 --> 12:35.025
Let's go.

12:39.585 --> 12:41.145
Prosecutor.

12:42.925 --> 12:44.445
Prosecutor.

12:46.585 --> 12:48.205
Prosecutor.

12:51.075 --> 12:52.525
Prosecutor...

12:56.355 --> 12:58.865
Are you coming around now?

13:04.735 --> 13:06.575
How did I...?

13:06.685 --> 13:11.115
I know things aren't going well these days,

13:11.125 --> 13:13.505
but how could you do something like this?

13:14.185 --> 13:17.955
You are more upright than anyone,
and you never back down. So, why?

13:17.965 --> 13:19.905
Why did you do that?

13:21.005 --> 13:22.075
It's not like that.

13:22.085 --> 13:24.145
What do you mean it's not like that?

13:24.155 --> 13:26.205
You lit something weird inside your car.

13:26.215 --> 13:29.845
Keep this a secret at the office
for a while.

13:29.945 --> 13:33.865
Of course.
Otherwise, you'll become a laughing-stock.

13:33.875 --> 13:35.945
I said it's not like that.

13:36.515 --> 13:38.165
And...

13:39.045 --> 13:42.905
Chairman Chun Jae Man, secretly follow him.

13:42.915 --> 13:44.495
Follow him?

13:45.745 --> 13:50.445
By the way.
Check your phone, you keep getting texts.

14:00.235 --> 14:01.835
This person...

14:04.145 --> 14:06.155
He's Chairman Chun's man.

14:07.285 --> 14:10.165
Then, Chun Jae Man tried to...

14:11.255 --> 14:12.625
Chairman Chun?

14:12.635 --> 14:16.615
Following Chairman Chun...
Do it closely and don't mess up.

14:16.785 --> 14:18.395
Where are you going, Prosecutor?

14:18.405 --> 14:19.885
You have to rest more.

14:19.895 --> 14:21.176
Forget that.

14:21.177 --> 14:25.112
Do you know who called the cops for me?

14:25.175 --> 14:27.205
I'm not too sure.

14:32.865 --> 14:35.065
Lee Yoon Sung actually...

14:37.035 --> 14:38.145
Let's go to the office.

14:38.155 --> 14:41.095
Prosecutor, you need to rest.

14:57.825 --> 15:00.205
This man says his stomach hurts
and he feels like throwing up.

15:00.335 --> 15:02.365
If you know the language,
do you mind helping?

15:02.425 --> 15:04.235
Please wait just a minute.

15:04.555 --> 15:06.805
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

15:06.935 --> 15:09.745
He's with Kim Na Na.

15:09.775 --> 15:11.475
I told you last time, right?

15:11.525 --> 15:14.815
The day at the hospital when you took
Lee Yoon Sung's blood sample to the NFS,

15:14.845 --> 15:19.325
I lost track of him at the hospital
because of Kim Na Na.

15:21.255 --> 15:24.345
Investigator Jang, for now investigate
Lee Yoon Sung,

15:24.395 --> 15:25.975
or John Lee's family,
who claims to reside in America.

15:26.045 --> 15:27.745
John Lee?

15:29.215 --> 15:33.285
The reason why you almost died...
It's related to the City Hunter...

15:33.315 --> 15:35.205
If we follow the City Hunter,

15:35.265 --> 15:38.105
Chairman Chun's corruption
will reveal itself.

15:38.205 --> 15:43.095
And I think Lee Yoon Sung
is Lee Kyung Hee and Park Moo Yul's son.

15:43.205 --> 15:46.055
And Steven Lee is linked somehow.

15:46.685 --> 15:48.765
Let's investigate John Lee's parents first.

15:48.775 --> 15:52.885
The reason you're so invested
in the City Hunter's case...

15:53.075 --> 15:56.075
Is it per chance because of your dad?

15:56.395 --> 15:58.655
I'd be lying if I said no.

15:58.665 --> 16:02.885
The City Hunter sent Lee Kyung Wan
and Seo Young Hak to me,

16:02.895 --> 16:04.785
so I'll do a little something for him
in return.

16:04.795 --> 16:10.795
Whatever went down in 1983,
I'm going to investigate it to the end.

16:24.785 --> 16:27.835
If you had disclosed it when I asked you to,

16:28.585 --> 16:31.305
this wouldn't have happened.

16:32.785 --> 16:34.815
200 billion won...

16:35.835 --> 16:37.595
You really...

16:44.205 --> 16:45.965
Mr. President...

17:03.565 --> 17:07.805
I'm really sorry
for what has happened to your father.

17:08.385 --> 17:10.875
I could have stopped it from happening,

17:11.895 --> 17:14.244
but I couldn't persuade my father,

17:15.025 --> 17:17.765
or even find the City Hunter.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.755
That's what bothers me so much.

17:21.185 --> 17:23.045
The tuition money...

17:23.885 --> 17:27.494
If he had turned himself in,
he wouldn't be in that state right now.

17:28.145 --> 17:32.535
Do you know how much courage
it takes to turn oneself in?

17:33.315 --> 17:39.995
When I was in elementary school,
my family was really poor.

17:40.955 --> 17:48.215
One day, I was really hungry,
so I stole my friend's lunch.

17:48.225 --> 17:53.185
The teacher found out and told everyone
in class to cover their eyes with one hand.

17:53.255 --> 17:57.295
She said if the person who stole the lunch
raised his hand, she would forgive him.

17:57.425 --> 18:00.541
But, in the end,
I still couldn't raise my hand,

18:00.542 --> 18:03.571
even though I felt apologetic
towards my friends.

18:05.645 --> 18:08.835
My friends complained
their arms hurt from punishment,

18:08.845 --> 18:14.085
and as more and more time passed,
it became harder and harder to confess.

18:14.665 --> 18:16.905
That's what it feels like
to confess your crimes.

18:16.945 --> 18:19.625
Your father probably felt the same.

18:19.825 --> 18:22.335
I am no different as well.

18:23.615 --> 18:31.115
That sudden sense of lost opportunity
is a scary feeling.

18:47.825 --> 18:49.318
Oh, sorry.

18:49.605 --> 18:51.785
I came in without your permission.

18:53.675 --> 18:56.575
You didn't change the passcode.

18:57.415 --> 18:58.795
What are you doing here?

18:58.805 --> 19:00.945
Oh, sit down.

19:02.105 --> 19:05.065
It's impolite to say things like that
when it's not my house, huh?

19:06.115 --> 19:09.215
I was just going to leave this and go.

19:09.725 --> 19:12.605
I guess I'm no good
at being a secret fairy godmother.

19:18.405 --> 19:20.235
Kim Young Joo...

19:20.865 --> 19:23.135
You must be lonely by yourself.

19:23.735 --> 19:26.735
I don't know
if this is the right way to express it,

19:28.375 --> 19:30.085
but I feel like
I've suddenly become an island.

19:30.095 --> 19:31.595
An island?

19:32.295 --> 19:37.555
You've never said anything like that before,
you must really be lonely.

19:39.065 --> 19:40.705
How's your father?

19:40.715 --> 19:44.695
I wanted to visit because I was worried,
but he has always disliked me.

19:46.595 --> 19:48.965
Dad ruined it all...

19:51.625 --> 19:56.185
You and me, and himself too.

20:00.835 --> 20:02.715
Have strength, Kim Young Joo.

20:02.725 --> 20:07.135
Being an island doesn't suit you.
You're more like a bridge.

20:07.145 --> 20:10.035
A bridge between people.

20:10.715 --> 20:12.225
A bridge...

20:13.465 --> 20:16.825
Yeah.
I feel stronger now.

20:16.835 --> 20:19.435
I always wanted to be your strength.

20:19.545 --> 20:21.435
Although I was jealous,

20:21.465 --> 20:25.055
whenever you found strength, you would
pour it all into work at the office.

20:29.155 --> 20:34.435
You have a big surgery coming up,
so you have to build up your body.

20:34.835 --> 20:37.365
Eat a lot.
If I were healthier...

20:37.395 --> 20:42.045
I'd roast a turkey for you,
but just eat this for now.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.925
Thank you, Ahjussi.

20:44.005 --> 20:45.735
Na Na, eat a lot, too.
You worked hard.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.925
Yeah, thank you.

20:50.335 --> 20:53.955
Yoon Sung, do you have to carry out
this revenge to the end?

20:53.965 --> 20:55.265
Why are you saying this all of a sudden?

20:55.275 --> 20:58.255
Maybe because of my near death experience,

20:59.435 --> 21:01.925
but I keep wondering if this is worth it...

21:01.945 --> 21:05.425
Can't we just go live happily
in another country without the boss knowing?

21:05.435 --> 21:08.995
We'll bring your mom, Na Na, and me?

21:09.005 --> 21:10.377
No.

21:10.378 --> 21:12.424
If I don't finish this,

21:13.385 --> 21:15.255
I'll never be able to live a normal life.

21:15.265 --> 21:16.095
Yoon Sung, I...

21:16.105 --> 21:18.325
I already set it up
to look like Mom went overseas.

21:18.335 --> 21:20.125
Father doesn't know either.

21:20.135 --> 21:23.205
I'll eat this later.
Thank you, Ahjussi.

21:27.265 --> 21:29.275
I made him lose his appetite...

21:33.355 --> 21:35.555
After all this ends...

21:38.185 --> 21:40.715
and if I'm still alive...

21:55.275 --> 21:56.825
It's birch bark and mushroom tea.

21:56.835 --> 21:58.835
It helps to cleanse your blood.

21:58.845 --> 22:03.625
If you're going to donate your bone marrow,
you have to be healthy first.

22:04.065 --> 22:06.595
But when are you going to do that?

22:06.645 --> 22:10.435
We have to wait for the test results,
nothing's confirmed yet.

22:10.445 --> 22:13.225
Everything's going to go well.

22:13.655 --> 22:17.505
No matter what you do, I believe in you.

22:17.925 --> 22:19.885
I'll be rooting for you.

22:20.735 --> 22:22.675
Really.

22:25.145 --> 22:27.955
You know right?
I like you, Yoon Sung.

22:28.935 --> 22:33.205
Brat, how can you say
that you like someone so easily?

22:33.435 --> 22:34.605
That's a skill, too.

22:34.615 --> 22:38.765
It's a good thing to like someone,
why would you need to hide that?

22:38.775 --> 22:41.785
Either way, I told you to have strength
so I'm going to leave.

22:41.795 --> 22:42.755
I'll take you home.

22:42.765 --> 22:46.655
No, it looks like
you have a lot to do, so work.

22:57.895 --> 23:00.055
<i>Is this revenge for Operation Clean Sweep?</i>

23:00.065 --> 23:01.395
<i>I see you remember.</i>

23:01.405 --> 23:04.085
<i>Those who risked their lives
for the motherland,</i>

23:04.095 --> 23:06.805
<i>you sacrificed them
off the shores of Nampo...</i>

23:09.545 --> 23:11.605
Operation Clean Sweep...

23:12.035 --> 23:14.135
Nampo Port...

23:14.705 --> 23:16.275
Lee Yoon Sung.

23:17.795 --> 23:20.355
What kind of a person are you?

23:21.845 --> 23:23.625
<i>City Hunter...</i>

23:23.655 --> 23:27.835
Is he really a traitor to the country
like Chairman Chun said?

23:28.005 --> 23:30.735
The things he did up till now
are closer to what a heroic outlaw would do.

23:30.745 --> 23:33.085
Like Hong Gil Dong, he exposed crimes
committed by corrupt government officials,

23:33.095 --> 23:37.895
and took back the stolen money and made
half priced tuition a reality for students.

23:38.065 --> 23:40.305
That was really satisfying.

23:40.315 --> 23:41.199
We have to thank the City Hunter too,

23:41.200 --> 23:43.408
for exposing the corruption case
with the defective military boots.

23:43.415 --> 23:45.435
The soles
won't have to be nailed back on anymore.

23:45.445 --> 23:47.775
Looking at all that,
he doesn't seem like a traitor,

23:47.785 --> 23:50.015
but someone
who really likes our country, no?

23:50.025 --> 23:51.735
I don't agree with that.

23:51.745 --> 23:55.885
It's definitely City Hunter
who tried to assassinate Seo Yong Hak.

23:55.895 --> 23:59.295
They say that it might be the City Hunter
who killed Lee Kyung Wan.

23:59.305 --> 24:02.105
I kind of wish that he won't get caught.

24:02.115 --> 24:04.795
And that he'll beat up all those jerks
who need to be taken down.

24:04.805 --> 24:07.305
That's new, you're always so sharp.

24:07.315 --> 24:08.682
Him sending those guys
to the prosecutor's office,

24:08.683 --> 24:10.904
means he's trying to settle it with the law.

24:10.975 --> 24:14.025
But if what Chairman Chun said is true,

24:14.035 --> 24:17.425
then shouldn't he also be punished
for inciting civil unrest of whatever?

24:17.435 --> 24:20.295
I don't believe what Chairman Chun said.

24:24.215 --> 24:31.495
Last time, I saw him ignore employees
who got sick from working at his facility.

24:33.495 --> 24:37.125
He blocked the press
from reporting anything about it, too.

24:38.165 --> 24:40.805
I don't trust anything
someone like that says.

24:40.815 --> 24:42.345
<i>Tada!</i>

24:44.465 --> 24:45.785
What is all this?

24:45.795 --> 24:47.995
It's all Dr. Lee Yoon Sung's pictures.

24:48.005 --> 24:49.715
I took them secretly.

24:49.835 --> 24:52.675
Since it's cheaper to order prints online,
I sent it over.

24:52.735 --> 24:54.705
How many are there?

24:54.715 --> 24:57.285
This amount makes you a stalker.

24:57.635 --> 24:59.475
What do you mean a stalker?

24:59.485 --> 25:03.005
Did I send him a letter written in blood
or creepily call him?

25:03.015 --> 25:06.235
I just innocently took a couple of pictures.

25:06.245 --> 25:07.625
A couple?

25:07.635 --> 25:09.645
It looks like about a hundred
without even counting.

25:09.655 --> 25:15.115
Either way, both of you have to
keep this a secret from Dr. Lee Yoon Sung.

25:15.125 --> 25:18.695
If he learns about this, he might say
he's going to quit tutoring me again.

25:18.705 --> 25:21.275
Da Hye, I feel so bad for you.

25:21.285 --> 25:23.085
Dr. Lee Yoon Sung,

25:23.095 --> 25:25.255
- towards me...
- What about you?

25:26.855 --> 25:29.255
Oh, never mind.

25:30.005 --> 25:34.635
Oh, this is a picture of
Agent Kim and Lee Yoon Sung.

25:35.515 --> 25:39.395
I was debating whether I should print this
or not because of Agent Kim.

25:39.405 --> 25:41.915
Dr. Lee's chin didn't come out right
in this photo.

25:42.465 --> 25:44.955
You can have it.
You came out pretty.

25:44.965 --> 25:46.605
Should I?

26:00.385 --> 26:02.875
Is Lee Yoon Sung in?

26:02.915 --> 26:05.385
Lee Yoon Sung left for work
outside the office.

26:18.985 --> 26:20.785
Suk Doo Shik.

26:21.235 --> 26:24.705
He started off as a boxer
and then joined a gang.

26:25.285 --> 26:27.285
That's quite a history.

26:27.365 --> 26:29.535
But now you're Chun Jae Man's shadow,

26:29.545 --> 26:33.155
and you take care
of all the background dirty work.

26:37.965 --> 26:40.325
[Credit Card Usage - Home Shopping
Electric Oven/Range 149,000 won]

26:40.335 --> 26:42.645
Ah, that ahjussi.
My gosh.

27:03.745 --> 27:06.825
How are you feeling?

27:07.865 --> 27:10.358
What are doing here...?

27:10.359 --> 27:12.476
Even if you come visit like this,
it's useless.

27:12.485 --> 27:15.225
Until you acknowledge that what happened
to me was a industrial accident,

27:15.235 --> 27:17.775
I'm going to maintain my alliance
with the factory workers.

27:17.785 --> 27:21.395
Maintaining an alliance?
That's good.

27:21.405 --> 27:24.255
But all of you seem to be oversimplifying
what an industrial accident is.

27:25.145 --> 27:26.289
Would it be an industrial accident

27:26.290 --> 27:28.735
if you got into a car accident
on your way to and from work?

27:28.745 --> 27:31.835
Would an accident due to drunk driving
also be considered an industrial accident?

27:31.845 --> 27:34.045
The company cannot be held responsible

27:34.055 --> 27:36.315
if someone falls ill
while working in our facility.

27:36.325 --> 27:38.997
So, you're saying the fact
that I was previously healthy

27:38.998 --> 27:40.313
and became sick after working there,

27:40.315 --> 27:42.685
and the people I worked with there
are dying one by one,

27:42.686 --> 27:44.186
are all just a coincidences?

27:44.195 --> 27:48.005
The court has ruled that there were
hazardous chemicals used in the facility.

27:48.015 --> 27:50.715
Did you not know this
prior to starting the job?

27:51.025 --> 27:51.725
What?

27:51.726 --> 27:54.689
We told you before you started working
that our factory works with

27:54.690 --> 27:58.228
benzene, toluene, and formaldehyde,
which are harmful to the body.

27:58.229 --> 28:00.758
We informed you of this before you joined
the company, isn't that so?

28:01.085 --> 28:05.045
Yes, I knew this before starting work.

28:05.545 --> 28:09.385
I'm raising a child by myself
and I couldn't find a job anywhere else.

28:10.135 --> 28:14.235
I knew the factory had a lot of problems,
but I went there to work anyway.

28:14.795 --> 28:19.955
But still, that doesn't mean
it's a lie that I'm sick.

28:19.965 --> 28:23.023
If the company doesn't acknowledge this,
no matter how many years it takes,

28:23.058 --> 28:28.125
I'm going to fight to expose the truth
that this is an industrial accident.

28:28.215 --> 28:32.465
Is there a guarantee that you'll be alive
at that time, Ms. Choi Myung Sook?

28:32.475 --> 28:36.685
Your child is still young,
if by chance something happens to you,

28:36.695 --> 28:39.455
I hear your child
will be sent to an orphanage.

28:39.465 --> 28:41.605
Yoon Shik, go outside.

28:41.615 --> 28:46.035
It's okay, mom's okay.
Go outside, hurry.

28:48.975 --> 28:54.895
Thus, our company has prepared
a special compensation for you.

28:54.905 --> 28:57.835
If you're willing
to accept the compensation,

28:57.945 --> 29:01.155
we can also add your son's name
to our scholarship fund list,

29:01.165 --> 29:03.595
so he can study without financial worries
through college.

29:03.605 --> 29:09.595
In addition, we'll guarantee him a job
at our company, after he graduates.

29:09.835 --> 29:15.179
Since you are the leader of the committee
protesting this as an industrial accident,

29:15.180 --> 29:17.015
I'm extending this special offer to you.

29:17.555 --> 29:23.555
But, Ms. Choi Myung Sook,
you must write a statement

29:23.627 --> 29:27.494
clarifying that your illness
has nothing to do with our factory.

29:27.495 --> 29:33.198
As for the workers making trouble,
if you persuade them to give up,

29:33.199 --> 29:36.135
I'll further add to the compensation.

29:37.325 --> 29:42.435
I'll send this person over here again
tomorrow.

29:43.185 --> 29:47.105
If you don't write the statement,

29:47.255 --> 29:52.275
you'll have to leave this hospital
immediately.

29:56.355 --> 29:57.785
Goodbye.

29:59.565 --> 30:01.045
Let's go.

30:11.645 --> 30:14.105
They say
ignorant fools know no fear.

30:14.115 --> 30:15.265
A corporate industrial accident?

30:15.275 --> 30:17.915
Do they really think it's that easy?

30:18.715 --> 30:23.155
We should have moved all our factories
overseas like Chairman Yoo.

30:23.365 --> 30:25.745
I can't sleep thinking about how
I'm giving money to people like that.

30:25.755 --> 30:28.475
I feel like it's a waste
to even give them a penny.

30:28.485 --> 30:31.305
Make her sign that Industrial Accident
Waiver, even if you have to use force.

30:31.315 --> 30:32.915
Yes, Sir.

30:33.695 --> 30:36.165
Chairman, here you are.

30:36.175 --> 30:40.325
The Ministry of Health and Welfare committee
members are in the spa at Terrace Sparkling.

30:40.335 --> 30:41.236
- Great.
- They're all very pleased

30:41.237 --> 30:42.164
and having a great time.

30:42.170 --> 30:44.045
They're important people
so take good care of them.

30:44.055 --> 30:46.815
You reserved that Korean restaurant
for afterwards, right?

30:46.825 --> 30:48.285
Yes.

30:48.295 --> 30:52.105
By the way, this is from Haewon Chemicals'
manufacturing department.

30:52.115 --> 30:54.665
It's a response to the civil rights group's
request for information.

30:54.675 --> 30:57.305
It's a list of chemicals
used during the manufacturing process.

30:57.315 --> 30:59.715
They asked if it's okay
to send it like this.

31:02.145 --> 31:03.705
Are you crazy?!

31:03.715 --> 31:05.455
If you let them know
all these chemicals are used,

31:05.505 --> 31:06.936
then it will be ruled an industrial accident
for sure.

31:06.937 --> 31:08.783
Are you that stupid?!

31:08.835 --> 31:11.305
Just tell them
it's confidential information.

31:11.315 --> 31:13.885
Tell them not release this
and don't even send a reply!

31:16.075 --> 31:17.885
That's what that was...?

31:17.895 --> 31:20.865
It was the first time I saw it
so I didn't know.

31:26.445 --> 31:28.705
Wow, it's 100 won.

31:28.715 --> 31:31.835
What the heck is this?

31:32.065 --> 31:35.005
100 won... my 100 won.

31:35.015 --> 31:38.595
Ahjussi, can you move your foot?
It's under your foot.

31:38.605 --> 31:41.915
The mother and the son
are both like beggars, geez.

31:41.925 --> 31:43.585
Get rid of him.

31:47.225 --> 31:48.855
Go play over there.

31:52.975 --> 31:55.315
These cheap people...

31:57.665 --> 31:59.185
Why is he mad at me?

31:59.195 --> 32:01.915
You make me do all the weird things.

32:08.435 --> 32:11.665
I'm not a beggar...

32:12.625 --> 32:16.045
I'm really not a beggar.

32:20.485 --> 32:21.905
Here.

32:23.635 --> 32:26.045
What are you trying to do
with all these coins you're picking up?

32:26.055 --> 32:29.675
I'm going to buy my mom a present.

32:30.735 --> 32:32.365
You're a good son.

32:39.685 --> 32:44.175
Wow, if you dig inside a garbage can,
then you're really a beggar.

32:47.365 --> 32:50.965

32:50.995 --> 32:53.695
<i>It will also help decrease the wrinkles
at the corners of your eyes.</i>

32:59.015 --> 33:01.015
Pretending like you weren't watching...

33:01.765 --> 33:04.355
Ahjussi, tape these together for me.

33:04.356 --> 33:05.556
Aigoo...

33:05.905 --> 33:08.265
You made this into confetti.

33:08.275 --> 33:09.965
Since you spent the whole day
watching the Home Shopping Channel,

33:09.966 --> 33:10.994
you should work for your pay.

33:10.995 --> 33:14.395
You did this on purpose to make me suffer,
didn't you?

33:14.405 --> 33:16.595
Seriously, are you always so negative?

33:18.065 --> 33:19.535
Na Na is here, go upstairs.

33:19.545 --> 33:20.985
Na Na?

33:26.785 --> 33:29.005
What are you doing in here
when the owner isn't home?

33:30.575 --> 33:32.845
Look.
Didn't it come out nice?

33:33.935 --> 33:35.385
Put it away.

33:35.435 --> 33:36.315
Why?

33:36.325 --> 33:39.055
When did you take this?
You're making me feel like crap.

33:39.065 --> 33:41.155
It makes you feel like crap?

33:41.685 --> 33:44.185
Do you think I would feel good about
a picture being taken without my knowledge?

33:44.415 --> 33:46.705
I feel like I got owned without any warning.

33:46.825 --> 33:48.265
Put it away.

33:50.525 --> 33:52.795
I'll just leave it here.

33:56.355 --> 33:59.055
Oh, Haewon Chemicals?

33:59.065 --> 34:02.015
This is where Yoon Shik's mom worked.

33:59.065 --> 34:02.015
{\a6}[Haewon Chemicals' Laborers:
"Acknowledge the Industrial Accident."]

34:02.025 --> 34:04.775
Haewon... so Chun Jae Man?

34:06.375 --> 34:07.920
I feel bad for her.

34:07.921 --> 34:11.217
An agent like me
works as a bullet-proof vest,

34:11.245 --> 34:15.795
but these people put their lives on the line
not knowing when they're going to get sick.

34:15.804 --> 34:18.565
Why won't they acknowledge her
as a victim of an industrial accident?

34:19.135 --> 34:20.844
I told you to stay out of it.

34:22.804 --> 34:25.534
Go.
Please go.

34:25.795 --> 34:28.335
Oh, it broke.

34:32.915 --> 34:34.369
You have a weird personality.

34:34.370 --> 34:36.024
You don't like looking
at this picture of us.

34:36.025 --> 34:40.195
You don't like working together.
What's so good about doing things alone?

34:41.245 --> 34:42.945
I'll throw it out.

34:44.375 --> 34:47.025
Throw it out or not, do whatever you want.

34:47.034 --> 34:48.784
I'm going.

34:49.465 --> 34:50.985
Hey, Kim...

35:04.085 --> 35:08.435
<i>As someone who risks his life every
single day, what could you possibly protect?</i>

35:08.445 --> 35:11.315
<i>You love
and you want to protect that love...</i>

<i>Do you think it's going to go
the way you plan?</i>

35:18.475 --> 35:21.365
H, Y, D, E...

35:22.915 --> 35:27.905
Oh... this is formaldehyde.

35:29.745 --> 35:31.501
Toluene...

35:31.702 --> 35:33.825
The pieces are coming together.

35:33.860 --> 35:35.435
I'm guessing these are scary things.

35:35.445 --> 35:36.945
Right?

35:37.555 --> 35:39.085
Kim Na Na.

35:39.665 --> 35:41.485
You didn't leave yet?

35:41.625 --> 35:43.952
Ahjussi is working so hard by himself,
how can I leave?

35:43.953 --> 35:46.214
You're not helping him either.

35:46.905 --> 35:49.965
Ahjussi.
I'm going out.

35:49.975 --> 35:51.605
Kim Na Na, let's go.

35:51.615 --> 35:54.685
Where... why?
Where are we going?

35:54.775 --> 35:57.225
You're in the prime of your lives...

36:00.765 --> 36:05.765
I'm sorry... about earlier.

36:06.405 --> 36:09.785
But I really don't like taking pictures.

36:11.195 --> 36:12.825
Okay.

36:12.835 --> 36:15.645
But give that picture back to me next time.

36:16.545 --> 36:18.265
I threw it out.

36:18.595 --> 36:21.985
You threw it out?
Why did you throw that out?

36:22.005 --> 36:24.445
You're really weird.

36:26.525 --> 36:27.855
Oh.

36:31.105 --> 36:34.735
What is this...?
It's just a twisty tie.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.985
It actually kind of looks like a ring,
right?

36:40.325 --> 36:41.705
It's pretty.

36:43.825 --> 36:45.435
Hello?

36:45.935 --> 36:49.645
<i>Mr. Lee Yoon Sung,
the results of your DNA test are back.</i>

36:49.655 --> 36:52.045
<i>You are a match to donate bone marrow
to your mother.</i>

36:52.055 --> 36:53.365
Really?

36:53.375 --> 36:55.565
Thank you for the good news.

36:56.905 --> 36:59.135
I'm a match for the transplant.

36:59.145 --> 37:02.325
Really? That's great.
Congratulations.

37:02.335 --> 37:04.565
Ahjumma can be saved now.

37:06.005 --> 37:08.925
You're saying John Lee's family
is having a hard time?

37:08.935 --> 37:11.005
There's no way.

37:11.445 --> 37:16.275
Both parents are living in a small rental
apartment in Houston, Texas.

37:16.285 --> 37:18.775
Did you look into where John Lee went
for elementary, middle, and high school?

37:18.835 --> 37:21.985
Yes, and for 12 years straight,
his attendance was bad,

37:22.015 --> 37:24.295
and his grades were in the bottom tier.

37:24.355 --> 37:28.915
But he went to MIT? And he finished
his doctoral degree in seven years.

37:28.925 --> 37:31.775
His grades at MIT are all A's.

37:31.785 --> 37:33.805
He even won an award for his dissertation.

37:33.815 --> 37:37.645
It makes you wonder if it's the same person,
something's definitely suspicious.

37:37.655 --> 37:40.485
Check again by asking his classmates.

37:45.935 --> 37:49.655
The narcotics team
busted a drug smuggling ring.

37:49.705 --> 37:53.675
They got caught while bringing it in
from Thailand, it must be them.

37:53.685 --> 37:55.094
Thailand?

37:55.495 --> 37:57.758
By the way, did you find out
about Lee Kyung Hee?

37:57.793 --> 38:00.935
Yeah, but I don't know where she's hiding.

38:00.945 --> 38:05.665
She wasn't on the list of recent
leukemia patients receiving treatment.

38:09.985 --> 38:11.605
What is that?

38:11.615 --> 38:14.235
It must be boring staying inside
the hospital room all day, right?

38:14.245 --> 38:17.205
At least you can listen to music
while staying here.

38:33.015 --> 38:36.715
That song is from long ago.

38:36.955 --> 38:39.735
How does a young person like you know of it?

38:55.115 --> 38:57.465
The patient really likes it.

38:57.475 --> 38:59.275
How is the patient?

38:59.285 --> 39:03.029
When she came back, her immune system
was very weak, we were worried,

39:03.030 --> 39:04.834
but she's recovering.

39:04.835 --> 39:07.515
Her son takes good care of her.

39:07.525 --> 39:11.645
He's also a match for a transplant, so they
scheduled a date and are waiting patiently.

39:11.875 --> 39:14.335
Please take good care of her.

39:22.065 --> 39:24.395
How are you feeling?

39:25.185 --> 39:27.885
You have to be in good condition
for the results to be good tomorrow.

39:27.895 --> 39:31.175
So don't worry about anything
and just rest today.

39:33.065 --> 39:38.785
I finally met my son after 28 years
and I haven't done anything for him.

39:39.065 --> 39:42.955
But for me to live,
it's causing his body more pain.

39:44.375 --> 39:46.995
I'm too ashamed to hold my head up.

39:47.005 --> 39:49.375
Don't say things like that.

39:49.595 --> 39:54.335
Lee Yoon Sung, has a body like a warrior
and he has a strong heart.

39:54.345 --> 39:58.875
After you get better, do all the things
you couldn't do for him before.

39:58.885 --> 40:03.275
Go on vacations together.
Make him a lot of delicious food, too.

40:05.095 --> 40:07.585
We'll invite you, too, Na Na.

40:17.375 --> 40:19.835
You shouldn't be coughing.

40:25.745 --> 40:27.295
But...

40:27.845 --> 40:32.405
Did my Yoon Sung not give you a ring?

40:32.555 --> 40:34.325
A ring?

40:34.565 --> 40:36.275
Oh...

40:37.585 --> 40:42.535
Yoon Sung must have felt shy.

40:58.945 --> 41:01.225
You're already changed.

41:01.555 --> 41:04.315
Yeah.
It's not my style.

41:04.325 --> 41:05.666
It's the same outfit for all patients,

41:05.667 --> 41:08.005
so of course
it can't be styled specifically for you.

41:08.065 --> 41:09.645
But it looks nice on you.

41:09.655 --> 41:10.915
You actually seem to like it.

41:10.925 --> 41:15.765
Of course,
Ahjumma is getting a stem cell transplant.

41:17.165 --> 41:20.735
Oh yeah, I have a gift for you,
Lee Yoon Sung.

41:20.745 --> 41:21.865
A present?

41:21.875 --> 41:27.665
I asked the nurses to let you stay with
your mom tonight in her isolation room.

41:28.085 --> 41:29.915
The doctors gave permission, too.

41:29.925 --> 41:34.765
This is a special service for only
special patients. Do you like it?

41:34.855 --> 41:37.705
Thank you, Kim Na Na.

41:40.755 --> 41:42.175
Um...

41:43.625 --> 41:44.975
What?

41:46.475 --> 41:48.105
Nothing.

41:56.335 --> 41:59.465
If everything goes well,
once we're discharged

41:59.855 --> 42:02.505
it will be close to Korean Thanksgiving.

42:04.535 --> 42:12.379
This Korean Thanksgiving,
I can make food with my Yoon Sung.

42:13.455 --> 42:17.925
Together, we can have
your father's annual memorial service.

42:21.295 --> 42:24.055
Why aren't you answering?

42:24.145 --> 42:26.780
For me...

42:27.417 --> 42:32.841
As long as you're not sick,
and you're happy,

42:33.545 --> 42:35.487
then that's enough.

42:35.522 --> 42:38.155
Your mom is already happy.

42:40.875 --> 42:44.905
Because of you, I can be cured.

42:45.235 --> 42:50.955
I'm very, very happy I got to meet you.

42:59.205 --> 43:01.615
I'm Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
from the Seoul Prosecutor's Office.

43:01.625 --> 43:03.655
I'm David Chan.

43:07.095 --> 43:11.955
You called so unexpectedly,
that I was only able to bring our yearbook.

43:11.965 --> 43:14.495
But why are you looking for John Lee?

43:14.505 --> 43:17.475
You graduated from Everest High School
in Houston, right?

43:17.485 --> 43:20.575
Yes, all the students from our area
went there.

43:20.585 --> 43:23.655
John Lee had to quit school
as soon as he started high school, but...

43:23.665 --> 43:26.365
He had to quit?
Why?

43:26.375 --> 43:31.075
Because of a car accident. He was hit by
a drunk driver and he died on the spot.

43:31.085 --> 43:33.775
Can I see a picture of John Lee?

43:35.895 --> 43:37.535
Here.

43:40.915 --> 43:42.175
Are you sure this is him?

43:42.185 --> 43:47.445
Of course, we took classes together
in junior high and we were quite close.

43:48.015 --> 43:51.995
His birthplace, his birthday, his parents,
the school he graduated from,

43:52.005 --> 43:53.955
everything is the same.

43:53.985 --> 43:57.075
John Lee isn't Lee Yoon Sung,
but Lee Yoon Sung lived as John Lee.

43:57.835 --> 43:59.605
Put in a call to America.

43:59.615 --> 44:00.975
Okay.

44:05.305 --> 44:09.105
Hello?
You're John Lee's mom, right?

44:09.115 --> 44:12.505
This is the Public Prosecutor's Office.
I called you earlier.

44:12.515 --> 44:14.885
Yes, please hold on.

44:16.305 --> 44:20.295
Hello. I'm Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
from the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office.

44:20.795 --> 44:24.235
I'm sorry, but could you explain
why your son

44:24.245 --> 44:27.935
who died in a car accident
was not reported as deceased?

44:27.945 --> 44:30.075
Please tell the truth.

44:30.085 --> 44:32.955
Forgery of legal documents
is a serious crime in America.

44:32.965 --> 44:35.295
<i>No, we didn't do it...</i>

44:35.305 --> 44:39.035
<i>It was a Korean man
who came from the Golden Triangle.</i>

44:39.045 --> 44:41.245
<i>- Triangle?
- Yeah.</i>

44:41.255 --> 44:44.325
<i>He was a Korean man from Triangle,</i>

44:44.335 --> 44:50.335
<i>who gave us money
and bought John Lee's identity from us.</i>

44:50.695 --> 44:52.095
- Name.
- Tai.

44:52.105 --> 44:53.915
- Next to you.
- Kai.

44:53.925 --> 44:55.435
- Age.
- 28.

44:55.445 --> 44:57.945
- Next to you.
- 27.

44:58.775 --> 45:00.085
What are you doing here?

45:00.095 --> 45:01.865
We're in the middle of an interrogation,
so please leave.

45:01.875 --> 45:03.755
It will be brief.

45:04.635 --> 45:05.935
Can't you see we're busy?

45:05.945 --> 45:07.245
Quit annoying us and get out.

45:07.255 --> 45:09.405
I can be more annoying.

45:09.415 --> 45:11.045
You know me.

45:11.555 --> 45:13.185
I won't say it twice.

45:13.195 --> 45:17.075
Let me speak to the Thai drug dealers
for a bit.

45:27.865 --> 45:30.065
Did you do everything I asked you to?

45:30.205 --> 45:32.175
Of course.

45:32.565 --> 45:33.985
Here.

45:34.605 --> 45:39.175
I'm a pro at putting puzzles together
and finding hidden pictures.

45:39.185 --> 45:40.555
It was easy.

45:40.565 --> 45:43.155
Bear Na Na, you did a great job
with that slow-witted mind of yours.

45:43.165 --> 45:44.605
And that's not all.

45:44.615 --> 45:48.485
If you look there, it's a report on Haewon
Chemicals that I found on the internet.

45:48.495 --> 45:50.515
Laborers are picketing to be acknowledged
as victims of an industrial accident,

45:50.525 --> 45:53.075
but the company claims
it has done nothing wrong.

45:53.085 --> 45:55.165
But, isn't it weird
that the company is huge,

45:55.166 --> 45:57.894
but only employees from one production line
are getting sick?

45:58.845 --> 46:00.455
If you look at the article behind that,

46:00.465 --> 46:03.915
it seems the company
isn't properly disposing its chemical waste.

46:03.925 --> 46:06.485
<i>Every 14th of the month is the day
they're supposed to dispose the chemicals,</i>

46:06.495 --> 46:10.605
<i>but there was an article saying they dump it
into nearby streams on rainy days.</i>

46:12.245 --> 46:15.235
Kim Na Na. You know how to do
these kinds of things, too?

46:15.245 --> 46:20.135
Why? Do I suddenly look prettier because
I did things you were supposed to do?

46:20.145 --> 46:23.005
Hey. I told you, look in the mirror.
Did you forget already?!

46:23.015 --> 46:26.355
You're... Chicken Na Na.

46:26.515 --> 46:28.735
Am I some kind of animal farm?

46:28.745 --> 46:31.285
You either call me a bear or a chicken
every day.

46:57.305 --> 47:00.245
Da Hye.
How long are you going to keep working here?

47:00.255 --> 47:04.455
Because of you I'm getting confused on
whether I work here or for the Blue House.

47:04.465 --> 47:08.135
Well, what can I do?
I have to buy my dad's birthday present.

47:08.145 --> 47:10.845
Mom cut all my allowance
because I spent too much at the club.

47:10.855 --> 47:13.705
Is there any other way?
I have to at least work part-time.

47:13.715 --> 47:18.575
It's not like there's a law
that a president's daughter can't work.

47:19.155 --> 47:21.545
But Unni, it's hard to work.

47:21.555 --> 47:26.135
Because of the video uploaded on the
internet last time, people recognize me.

47:26.145 --> 47:27.845
I even have an anti-club.

47:27.855 --> 47:31.965
Oh my, you know about it?

47:31.975 --> 47:34.945
You're not a member of that club are you?

47:34.955 --> 47:36.565
Are you crazy?

47:36.575 --> 47:39.675
But, you won't get into college like this.

47:40.515 --> 47:41.285
Did you give up?

47:41.295 --> 47:45.425
I think I'm more suited
for this kind of stuff than studying.

47:45.435 --> 47:51.215
Dr. Lee Yoon Sung likes coffee, so I can
become a barista and make him coffee...

47:51.695 --> 47:55.225
Yeah! Unni, I want to become a barista.
I must!

47:55.235 --> 47:58.825
Da Hye, Dr. Lee Yoon Sung...

48:00.965 --> 48:04.125
It's best to give up on dreams
which can't come true.

48:04.135 --> 48:10.125
Either way, for the time being, you really,
really must keep this a secret from my mom.

48:11.865 --> 48:13.185
Welcome.

48:13.195 --> 48:15.515
What drink can I get you?

48:16.135 --> 48:18.285
I found the right place, right Eun Hye?

48:18.295 --> 48:20.815
Yeah, you did.

48:20.825 --> 48:24.895
Uh... do you have a coffee
that's strong and refreshing?

48:24.905 --> 48:27.235
Should I get you
a double-shot iced Americano?

48:27.245 --> 48:28.875
That's very strong and refreshing.

48:28.885 --> 48:30.735
Okay.
One please.

48:30.745 --> 48:32.805
Eun Hye, what do you want?

48:32.815 --> 48:34.345
Me?

48:34.515 --> 48:39.585
I want a gold kiwi shake
and an ice cream waffle.

48:39.595 --> 48:41.765
Okay.
How would you like to pay your bill?

48:41.775 --> 48:44.235
Bill?
I'll pay.

48:46.865 --> 48:48.815
Did you eat?

48:48.825 --> 48:50.265
Yes.

48:50.715 --> 48:53.905
Customer, this card has been declined.

48:53.915 --> 48:55.425
Do you have another card?

48:55.435 --> 48:58.395
Declined?
Oh, really?

48:58.405 --> 49:00.495
I have another card.

49:01.805 --> 49:04.305
This is also declined.

49:04.365 --> 49:08.065
There's no way...
Uh, here.

49:08.635 --> 49:10.425
Declined.

49:10.435 --> 49:15.825
That shouldn't be...
I don't even have cash.

49:15.835 --> 49:20.195
Then, pay with...

49:22.555 --> 49:26.785
Add a strawberry smoothie to that order,
and put the entire order...

49:26.925 --> 49:28.595
on my card.

49:30.635 --> 49:32.935
Wait a minute...

49:33.155 --> 49:37.025
I have ten stamps on my coupon card,
so mine should be free, right?

49:37.035 --> 49:39.965
Yes, I'll ring you up.

49:47.105 --> 49:48.165
Hey, Lee Yoon Sung.

49:48.175 --> 49:49.435
Ahjussi, perfect timing...

49:49.445 --> 49:51.715
Can you go home and bring me
the news clippings on Chun Jae Man

49:51.725 --> 49:53.855
and the building floor plan
for Haewon Chemicals?

49:53.865 --> 49:56.195
The building is so old,
I can only use the floor plans.

49:56.205 --> 49:58.495
Floor plan?!
Floor plan, yeah right!

49:58.505 --> 50:01.225
I can't go! I won't!
If you want it, go get it yourself.

50:01.235 --> 50:02.585
What's wrong?

50:02.595 --> 50:03.845
Did something happen to you out there?

50:03.855 --> 50:04.975
Are you asking
because you really don't know?

50:04.985 --> 50:06.555
What is it?

50:07.905 --> 50:09.485
Cards!
Why did you stop all of them?

50:09.495 --> 50:11.965
I told you before to stop using the cards.
Didn't I?

50:11.975 --> 50:14.605
Should I read out loud all the itemized
bills from the Home Shopping Channel?!

50:14.615 --> 50:17.355
I told you I didn't buy it for myself!
I bought stuff for Na Na too! For Na Na!

50:17.365 --> 50:18.995
Don't use Na Na as an excuse.

50:19.005 --> 50:21.375
All the food you bring to the hospital
is from the Home Shopping Channel, too.

50:21.385 --> 50:22.085
Right?

50:22.086 --> 50:24.145
How can a man be so petty?
Who's the one who ate it so happily?

50:24.155 --> 50:26.965
Whatever! Keep a log of the things you buy
from now on,

50:26.975 --> 50:28.275
and I'll give you weekly allowance.

50:28.285 --> 50:30.275
Hey you, really...

50:30.525 --> 50:34.045
Punk... you've really changed.

50:36.375 --> 50:38.495
Ahjussi, you better not buy things
from Home Shopping Channel again!

50:38.505 --> 50:41.305
They're my cards, I'm going to use them
the way I want. So, what!?

50:41.606 --> 50:42.806
Ah, seriously...

50:44.195 --> 50:45.828
Geez... such a kid.

50:47.145 --> 50:49.905
If I stay here any longer,
someone's going to call me a shopaholic.

50:49.915 --> 50:53.465
Did I do it for me?
I did it for you and Na Na.

50:53.475 --> 50:55.715
I didn't even swipe that much, gosh...

50:57.405 --> 50:58.625
[Yoon Sung]

50:58.635 --> 51:00.165
Ha!

51:00.995 --> 51:03.655
Be well, Lee Yoon Sung.
I'm leaving.

51:07.355 --> 51:10.775
<i>The call cannot be connected,
transferring to voicemail.</i>

51:10.885 --> 51:12.965
You're going to stage a protest?

51:13.215 --> 51:15.725
We'll see if I reactivate your cards again.

51:20.025 --> 51:21.155
Yeah, Bear Na Na.

51:21.165 --> 51:26.065
Lee Yoon Sung, Shik Joong ahjussi
is at my house right now.

51:26.075 --> 51:28.035
But, there's a problem.

51:28.045 --> 51:29.325
What problem?

51:29.335 --> 51:32.805
I think Ahjussi ran away from home.

51:32.815 --> 51:34.375
He came with his luggage.

51:34.385 --> 51:35.835
What?

51:36.725 --> 51:39.835
That Ahjussi seriously... okay.

51:41.285 --> 51:44.255
He's changed.
He wasn't like that at the Triangle.

51:44.265 --> 51:47.485
I think nothing is too good for him,
but he thinks everything is wasted on me.

51:47.495 --> 51:50.145
Do you know how much grief
he gives me lately over the food?

51:50.155 --> 51:51.885
I'm so sad.

51:51.895 --> 51:56.235
Oh, Huay...
I can't even think of the name...

51:56.245 --> 51:58.205
Huay Ni...

51:58.215 --> 52:01.605
Ahjussi, what are you doing here right now?

52:01.725 --> 52:03.095
Hurry up and get up so we can leave.

52:03.105 --> 52:05.915
No!
I can't live with you anymore.

52:05.925 --> 52:07.355
Being bullied, I can't live like that.

52:07.365 --> 52:08.495
I gave the cards to you because I trust you,

52:08.505 --> 52:10.485
but my cell phone rings nonstop daily with
text messages about credit card purchases.

52:10.495 --> 52:12.075
Have you thought about the stress
that causes me?

52:12.085 --> 52:13.935
Then turn off the ringer
and don't let it ring!

52:13.945 --> 52:15.545
When I came here from the Triangle,
what did you say to me?

52:15.555 --> 52:17.605
That there are a lot of good things here
and you'll let me do whatever I want.

52:17.615 --> 52:19.155
You said you'll let me live in luxury,

52:19.165 --> 52:21.015
but you get me beaten up by weird people
all day long,

52:21.025 --> 52:22.705
you make me wash windows on high buildings,

52:22.715 --> 52:25.835
and send me out to pose
as an insurance worker and commit fraud!

52:26.645 --> 52:27.985
I'm going to go back to the Triangle.

52:27.995 --> 52:31.035
Go? Where do you think you're going?!
You know that I can't live without you.

52:31.045 --> 52:32.635
Can't live without?!

52:32.645 --> 52:35.835
You only scold me.
Yeah right, you can't live without me.

52:36.575 --> 52:39.565
Ahjussi,
I told you I can't live without you. Okay?

52:39.985 --> 52:41.285
I was wrong.

52:41.295 --> 52:42.865
Did I do it only for myself?

52:42.875 --> 52:45.345
I was just trying to feed you
and take care of you...

52:45.355 --> 52:48.205
I know, I know.
I was wrong. All right?

52:48.215 --> 52:50.095
I'll let you use the cards,
will that do?

52:50.105 --> 52:51.215
Yeah.

52:51.225 --> 52:55.325
Excuse me, but can you take
your marital spat back to your house?

52:59.965 --> 53:02.225
Such an embarrassment!
Geez!

53:02.235 --> 53:03.875
Let's... let's go.

53:04.355 --> 53:05.295
Can you take this?

53:05.305 --> 53:06.815
Yeah. Okay.

53:06.825 --> 53:09.595
Hurry up, let's go.

53:09.605 --> 53:11.525
Go back safely.

53:11.535 --> 53:12.495
Na Na, come visit.

53:12.505 --> 53:13.905
Okay.

53:14.115 --> 53:15.545
I'm sorry.

53:25.265 --> 53:27.835
Shik Joong ahjussi just left in a taxi.

53:27.845 --> 53:29.505
Is your body feeling okay?

53:29.515 --> 53:31.785
No, I don't think it is.

53:31.795 --> 53:33.295
Really?

53:35.215 --> 53:37.745
Oh, you have a fever.

53:43.315 --> 53:46.165
My fever is going down right now,

53:46.475 --> 53:49.895
so until it's completely gone,
don't move and wait here.

53:56.425 --> 53:59.695
What was it like living in the Triangle?

54:00.485 --> 54:04.185
Did you have other friends
besides your floppy-eared friend?

54:06.155 --> 54:08.385
It's really hot there, right?

54:08.635 --> 54:12.745
Lee Yoon Sung, you're in for it now.
Korea's winter is really cold.

54:12.955 --> 54:15.855
I lived in America before, too.

54:16.795 --> 54:19.715
Oh... right. You did.

54:25.965 --> 54:29.205
You're staring at me with sexy eyes
right now, aren't you?

54:33.295 --> 54:37.905
You never let a chance go by.
Do you really like me that much?

54:39.645 --> 54:43.315
This is why the person who confesses
always loses.

54:44.275 --> 54:46.715
Yeah, I like you Lee Yoon Sung.
Happy?

54:46.725 --> 54:50.895
Wow, how can a girl confess so easily...?

54:51.575 --> 54:53.575
You iron face.

54:57.905 --> 55:03.285
But... Lee Yoon Sung, why don't you say it?

55:05.165 --> 55:09.605
Why don't you tell me you like me?

55:13.255 --> 55:17.105
Are you going to keep on making me feel
like I'm losing out here?

55:18.135 --> 55:20.525
Tell me.
All right?

55:20.535 --> 55:22.985
Tell me, now.
Hurry.

55:22.995 --> 55:25.395
Tell me.

55:26.695 --> 55:28.839
Saying that I like you...

55:30.469 --> 55:32.532
I can't do that for you.

55:32.745 --> 55:34.455
Don't wait for it.

55:37.144 --> 55:42.045
Sheesh. It's not like I really wanted
to hear it. I was just saying...

55:44.175 --> 55:47.015
I have my own pride, too.

55:48.685 --> 55:52.955
But, you have to grant me a wish
this winter.

55:52.965 --> 55:57.025
I'm going to think of one
that's going to be really hard to grant.

55:59.485 --> 56:02.425
I'm going.
Rest.

56:35.115 --> 56:37.345
Yeah, Kim Na Na.

56:37.555 --> 56:41.645
It's not like you didn't know.
Let's not get hurt.

57:06.565 --> 57:08.855
I have to live like this...

57:10.895 --> 57:13.225
How could I tell you...

57:13.995 --> 57:15.835
that I like you?

57:26.635 --> 57:31.305
Laborers are not animals.
Let us live like humans!

57:31.315 --> 57:35.255
Let us live! Let us live!

58:01.275 --> 58:03.295
<i>At night, don't do that.</i>

58:03.485 --> 58:05.275
What is this?

58:05.515 --> 58:08.105
You guys were a mess while I was gone.

58:53.465 --> 58:57.605
Oh. Isn't he doing his rounds right now?
But no one is there?

58:57.615 --> 58:58.385
Call him.

58:58.395 --> 58:59.805
Yeah.

59:00.295 --> 59:02.915
This is the control room,
this is the control room, report.

59:04.075 --> 59:05.025
He's not responding.

59:05.035 --> 59:08.273
Is he sleeping?
This is the control room, control room!

59:08.427 --> 59:09.454
Set off the exhaust gas pipes
in factory room 3.

59:09.455 --> 59:11.225
- Follow me.
- Okay.

01:01:08.635 --> 01:01:10.285
[Bear Na Na]

01:01:15.545 --> 01:01:18.435
<i>Lee Yoon Sung, you weren't sleeping, right?</i>

01:01:18.485 --> 01:01:24.485
Yoon Sung, I thought about it...
on the last day of the year,

01:01:25.155 --> 01:01:28.405
do you want to go hear the City Bell ring?

01:01:28.675 --> 01:01:33.635
<i>While we're there, we can wish for Ahjumma
to get better too. It's a good idea, right?</i>

01:01:33.985 --> 01:01:39.175
Then, I'm going to reserve a spot at the
Cafe, so you can't back out later.

01:01:39.185 --> 01:01:42.015
<i>Okay?
It's a promise.</i>

01:01:44.385 --> 01:01:47.895
<i>Lee Yoon Sung, can you hear me?</i>

01:01:50.755 --> 01:01:54.875
Lee Yoon Sung, are you listening to me?

01:01:58.995 --> 01:02:01.075
Lee Yoon Sung...

01:02:33.205 --> 01:02:34.855
<i>You're late.</i>

01:02:39.195 --> 01:02:41.215
I've been waiting a long time for you.

01:02:45.625 --> 01:02:48.665
You should have called
and made an appointment.

01:02:49.055 --> 01:02:50.505
What do you want?

01:02:50.515 --> 01:02:53.925
You don't look good, are you sick?

01:02:53.935 --> 01:02:58.315
I was out partying all night at a club.
The air there isn't good.

01:02:58.325 --> 01:03:01.605
That's just like you, club and girls.

01:03:01.815 --> 01:03:05.375
By the way, the City Hunter sent me a video.

01:03:05.385 --> 01:03:08.185
It seems Chairman Chun is after my life.

01:03:08.195 --> 01:03:13.995
I'm thankful to the City Hunter for worrying
about someone who's out to arrest him.

01:03:14.115 --> 01:03:16.905
If I meet the City Hunter,

01:03:16.915 --> 01:03:21.485
I'll tell him that Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
is very thankful.

01:03:24.775 --> 01:03:27.145
You look tired, get a good rest.

01:03:27.875 --> 01:03:29.685
Poo Chai.

01:03:57.595 --> 01:04:00.355
<i>The classified document
disappeared from the NIS.</i>

01:04:00.365 --> 01:04:01.485
<i>From the NIS?</i>

01:04:01.495 --> 01:04:02.357
<i>Should we look at it together?</i>

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:04.675
<i>Lee Jin Pyo...
The sole survivor of Operation Clean Sweep.</i>

01:04:04.685 --> 01:04:06.475
<i>And Lee Yoon Sung,
you're the City Hunter, right?</i>

01:04:06.485 --> 01:04:08.075
<i>I'll reveal it to you right here.</i>

01:04:08.085 --> 01:04:11.185
<i>How long are you going to hold onto
memories of people no longer by your side?</i>

01:04:11.215 --> 01:04:13.405
<i>I don't have the confidence
in letting you go.</i>

01:04:13.415 --> 01:04:15.515
Kim Na Na, I like you.
