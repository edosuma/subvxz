00:01.000 --> 00:02.331
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.400 --> 00:03.400
Time to go.

00:03.480 --> 00:05.005
Go where?
Portland.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.602
The only people who have any
connection to your child are there.

00:07.680 --> 00:08.886
So, we will be, too.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.888
Oh, my God.
How did this happen?

00:13.000 --> 00:14.001
I don't know.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.366
Found someone you can talk to.

00:15.440 --> 00:16.805
I don't need a therapist.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.008
This is not
a therapist, believe me.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.441
Hello, Juliette.

00:23.640 --> 00:28.168
I believe we have
a great deal to talk about.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.282
"Everyone sees what you
appear to be, few experience

00:34.360 --> 00:36.010
what you really are."

00:58.760 --> 00:59.966
Once he has begun,

01:00.120 --> 01:02.407
you must not,
at any time, do anything

01:02.480 --> 01:04.721
that interferes
with his communication.

01:04.959 --> 01:08.407
Connection with the spirit
world is not easy to achieve

01:08.480 --> 01:11.165
and difficult to sustain if
there are any distractions.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.685
Do you understand?
I do.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.404
If he is successful,

01:14.480 --> 01:16.801
if Laszlo finds your husband,

01:16.880 --> 01:20.009
there is no guarantee
your husband will accept him.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.004
Spirits can be unpredictable.

01:23.240 --> 01:27.962
But if he finds
union with his spirit,

01:28.040 --> 01:33.080
you will see him change into
Fado, an ancient holy spirit.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.210
Do not be frightened
of this change.

01:36.280 --> 01:38.851
It is proof of his emergence.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.047
Are you ready?

01:40.400 --> 01:41.606
I am.

01:45.840 --> 01:46.841
Laszlo.

01:48.680 --> 01:49.681
She is ready.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.246
Are you?

01:51.320 --> 01:52.606
Of course.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.411
Laszlo is ready.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.561
Okay.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.405
Say his name.

02:24.680 --> 02:25.727
Louis.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.249
What do you want to say to him?

02:29.640 --> 02:31.529
I miss you, Louis.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.568
I miss you so much.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.567
It's so hard to
keep going alone.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.927
I feel his presence, outside.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.288
He is coming in now.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.644
He is here with us.

02:51.720 --> 02:53.484
Where? Where is he?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.570
What's happening?

03:01.920 --> 03:04.002
Oh... Oh...

03:04.120 --> 03:06.691
Don't be frightened
by what you see.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.326
Anne,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.287
Louis is here, beside you.

03:17.480 --> 03:18.527
Yes?

03:19.240 --> 03:20.890
Yes.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.924
He loves you and misses you,

03:25.000 --> 03:27.480
more than life itself.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.051
He thinks about you

03:29.120 --> 03:32.169
every moment of every dying day.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.325
He thinks about how you met

03:35.480 --> 03:38.086
at Colonel White High School.

03:38.160 --> 03:41.642
He's saying
something about your hair.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.363
Does that mean anything to you?

03:46.200 --> 03:47.247
Yes.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.800
Yes, he always liked it long.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.565
He still does.

03:52.720 --> 03:55.644
Louis, why do you have to leave?

03:56.320 --> 03:57.685
There's more to...

04:02.360 --> 04:04.840
He's gone? But why?

04:06.200 --> 04:09.124
Bring him back, please.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.085
He had to go.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.606
Something was wrong.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.128
He said that I
could try again...

04:20.399 --> 04:21.640
Tuesday.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.648
I can feel my husband with me.

04:28.720 --> 04:31.121
It was so wonderful.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.449
Laszlo, I saw him
change into Fado.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.330
If I hadn't seen it,
I wouldn't have believed it.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.130
Oh, wait. Let me...

04:47.360 --> 04:49.010
it takes a lot out of him.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.651
He'll need a couple
of days to recover.

04:51.720 --> 04:55.281
But now that he
has made contact,

04:55.360 --> 04:58.409
it will be even
better next time.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.527
Tuesday, right?

04:59.600 --> 05:01.523
That's what he said.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.524
Oh! Thank you.
Thank you so much.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.085
Fifteen hundred.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.527
You could have gotten more.
I was very good tonight.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.965
We'll get more.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.405
She's coming back.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.210
Too bad you won't be here.

05:27.240 --> 05:28.240
Who are you?

05:28.280 --> 05:29.327
Doesn't matter.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.401
What do you want?

05:30.960 --> 05:31.961
Pictures.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.240
- Henrietta, I need your help.
- You do.

06:44.880 --> 06:48.089
Sean told me about your
sudden change of life.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.401
That must have
been very shocking.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.528
Well, how do I stop it,
how do I make it go away?

06:52.640 --> 06:54.449
Are you sure you want to,

06:54.520 --> 06:56.522
before you understand
your true self?

06:56.840 --> 07:00.606
Yeah, I don't wanna understand my
true self. I just want my old self.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.967
Well, show me what you got.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.360
What do you mean?

07:04.400 --> 07:06.448
Show me what you are.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.651
I don't know how.

07:10.720 --> 07:11.881
How did you do it before?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.365
I don't know, it just happened.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.245
Well, this has happened
in a very unorthodox way.

07:16.320 --> 07:19.369
But until I see what
we're dealing with here,

07:19.520 --> 07:21.124
I won't be able to help you.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.804
I'll try.

07:25.680 --> 07:28.001
No, no, no, no,
you're working too hard.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.130
Let me help you.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.245
Ah!

07:35.320 --> 07:36.970
Now we're talking.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.246
How do I stop it?

07:40.040 --> 07:41.883
Relax.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.250
Let go.

07:45.360 --> 07:48.045
You have to let it happen,
you can't make it happen.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.726
So can you help me?

07:59.040 --> 08:02.249
Perhaps, but it's
gonna be challenging.

08:02.320 --> 08:05.961
You have to practice your
Woge, learn to control it.

08:06.040 --> 08:09.328
Right now you're like a... A
five year old with a loaded gun.

08:09.400 --> 08:10.640
I could hurt somebody.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.000
Yes, of course.

08:12.080 --> 08:16.529
You now have access
to a primal force of nature.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.846
Who else knows about this?

08:17.920 --> 08:19.001
Only Sean.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.161
You haven't told the Grimm?

08:20.240 --> 08:21.401
No, I'm afraid to.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.329
That's wise.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.841
Grimms are not known
to be fond of Hexenbiests.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.163
His natural instinct would
be to take your head off.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.089
I'm sure he loves you.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.811
You don't need to panic.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.006
I need a little
bit of your blood.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.206
Why?

08:36.280 --> 08:38.123
You want your true
self back, don't you?

08:44.159 --> 08:45.810
It's getting hot.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.851
It's really hot. Ow.

08:48.920 --> 08:49.921
Hold still.

08:58.440 --> 08:59.487
What are you doing?

09:00.680 --> 09:02.444
Seeing what
you're made of.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.005
It has to syncretize.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.127
How long will that take?

09:36.200 --> 09:37.201
No telling.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.446
I'll call you when I have
something to show you.

10:02.280 --> 10:03.600
I think
I've been here before.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.762
You had your fortune told?
Actually I did.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.760
About 20 years ago,
at the Cleveland County Fair.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.962
I was supposed to be
a rock star and rich.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.121
But that was in Ohio.

10:11.200 --> 10:14.044
However, now I happen to
be talking about this MO here.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.121
It's the same as we had
with that security firm.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.761
Rather large stab wounds to the
chest, the ones with scorpion venom.

10:21.840 --> 10:23.444
So, thanks to my
quality late night

10:23.560 --> 10:25.210
caffeine-fueled
trailer time,

10:25.280 --> 10:27.282
I would suggest we're dealing
with a Manticore or

10:27.360 --> 10:28.691
something similar.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Who reported?

10:31.040 --> 10:33.122
Landlord came by this
morning to collect the rent.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.406
Instead...

10:37.240 --> 10:39.049
He found the bodies.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.126
Am I right?

10:43.200 --> 10:44.281
Yep.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.441
Looks like a Manticore.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.409
Guess we can
rule out robbery.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.126
Anything on the vics?

10:50.200 --> 10:52.646
Mabel and Laszlo Kurlon
from the Czech Republic.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.529
Been in Portland
just over a year,

10:54.600 --> 10:56.364
and renting
the shop for nine months.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.487
How many ways in?

10:57.560 --> 10:58.607
Two.
Back door was unlocked.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.404
Front door was unlocked.
Lights were still on.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.721
So whoever came in
didn't have to work for it.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.485
They just came in for the kill.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.364
Maybe they got a bad fortune.

11:06.440 --> 11:07.880
If the fortune
tellers were any good,

11:07.920 --> 11:09.285
they would have
seen this coming.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.286
Got an appointment book.

11:12.120 --> 11:15.090
Last appointment
last night, 7:30.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.764
Got a name?

11:16.840 --> 11:18.205
Well, if I could read it.

11:18.320 --> 11:19.560
Starts with a "P."

11:19.640 --> 11:20.926
Let me work on it.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.008
Where's the landlord?
I got him outside.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.370
They've been
tenants for nine months.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.727
I've got all the receipts
back at the office.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.848
They always paid
on time in cash.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.962
I didn't demand that,
I take checks.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.048
They just wanted to pay in cash.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.201
Were they married?

11:37.280 --> 11:38.884
They said they were.

11:38.960 --> 11:42.123
Nothing like this has ever
happened at any of my properties.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.965
I saw the bodies, how the
hell were they killed?

11:45.040 --> 11:46.166
We're working on that.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.446
Were they
worried at all?

11:47.560 --> 11:49.847
Did they mention anything
that they had problems with?

11:49.920 --> 11:53.288
Not to me. They always just
seemed pretty normal.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.640
Well, but for what they did.

11:54.760 --> 11:55.921
They ever tell your fortune?

11:56.640 --> 11:59.803
By that, I mean did they ever
tell you how they told fortunes?

11:59.920 --> 12:02.366
No, I'm not much on fortunes.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.408
I don't want to know, you know?

12:04.480 --> 12:05.680
Did you ask for any references?

12:05.720 --> 12:07.449
I asked, but I never checked.

12:07.520 --> 12:10.763
I think they said they were
in Reno before here.

12:10.840 --> 12:13.080
We need you to put down all
the references they told you.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.646
I can do that.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.485
Looks like I got
a match on Anne Peyton.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.280
Got an address
in the south-east

12:20.360 --> 12:21.691
and a phone
number to go with it.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.521
Could she be the Manticore?

12:23.600 --> 12:25.648
She was the last one
scheduled to see them.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.850
If she is, she's not gonna
make a move on three cops.

12:56.800 --> 13:00.486
This is my favorite
picture of Louis and me.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.450
We were on vacation in Vermont.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.602
We were so happy.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.724
It was right before
he was diagnosed.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.682
Tell us what happened
last night in the session.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.683
Oh! it was amazing.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.684
I wasn't sure if I was just
making a fool of myself or what.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.161
But a friend of
mine went to them,

13:19.240 --> 13:21.607
and she said it was incredible.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.405
And that's why I went.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.730
And it was!

13:26.040 --> 13:27.485
Did you see any
physical changes?

13:27.560 --> 13:28.800
Oh, yes.

13:28.880 --> 13:34.125
Yes, uh, Laszlo channeled
this spirit called Fado.

13:35.880 --> 13:41.171
I know how it sounds, but I swear
it was real, I saw him change.

13:41.240 --> 13:45.245
His whole face, he was something
completely different.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.961
It's, it's kind of
hard to describe.

13:49.800 --> 13:53.282
He had fur and he was
sort of animal-like.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.765
You must think I'm crazy.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.569
Who was in the room with you
when it happened?

13:59.640 --> 14:02.962
Just me and Laszlo and Mabel.

14:04.280 --> 14:07.045
You said Laszlo changed.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.771
Did Mabel change in any way?

14:08.840 --> 14:10.080
Oh, no.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.323
They didn't do anything wrong.

14:12.400 --> 14:17.486
I communicated with my husband last
night, I'm absolutely sure of it.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.449
I mean, they were
worth every penny.

14:19.520 --> 14:22.364
I just, I can't believe that
somebody would kill them!

14:22.440 --> 14:27.082
I wanted so badly to speak
to my husband again.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.442
I'm sorry, it's just...

14:31.760 --> 14:33.603
It's been so lonely.

14:57.840 --> 15:01.526
...He'll wish he never
brought it to a vote.

15:05.080 --> 15:06.411
What have you got?

15:06.480 --> 15:08.130
Confirmation.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.726
Sent by Jonathon
Wilde moments ago.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.485
Mabel and Laszlo Kurlon.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.969
Numerous violations
of Section 32.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.441
The outstanding warrant
goes back four years.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.602
They eluded the Marechaussee
longer than most.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.490
They never learn, do they?

15:24.760 --> 15:26.842
The money's too easy,
I'm afraid.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.081
Authorize payment.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.286
There's more.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.967
Wilde is asking for another
Eigenverantwortung.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.008
Authority to kill whom?

15:36.360 --> 15:37.361
Hmmm.

15:40.680 --> 15:46.050
I'm afraid no one is going
to miss you, Mr. Darwell.

15:49.240 --> 15:52.210
Love to travel
but glad to be home.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.521
Minus the unpacking
and paying the bills part.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.966
Don't forget the laundry.
Not much fun in that either.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.008
But we had such a great time.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.730
Well, we sure did.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.844
Okay, back to reality.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.965
I wonder if I should call
Nick, tell him we're back.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.289
Hmm.
That didn't take long.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.362
No, you know, just in
case something, like,

16:12.440 --> 16:14.408
pertinent happened
while we were gone.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.124
Sure. Go ahead.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.086
You sure?

16:19.200 --> 16:21.089
Actually, I'd kind of
like to know too.

16:21.160 --> 16:22.241
Okay.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.324
So the widow is
not your Manticore?

16:30.400 --> 16:33.131
Oh, she's not even Wesen,
according to Nick.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.406
But Laszlo had to be.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.164
And he wasn't hiding it.
He was using it.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.004
That's why she
was so convinced

16:39.080 --> 16:40.809
he was talking to the dead.
He Woged.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.968
Yeah, you see something like
that, you'll believe anything.

16:43.040 --> 16:45.725
The Manticore had to have
shown up just after she left.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.690
The shop was still open, lights
were still on, doors unlocked.

16:48.760 --> 16:51.081
So if we have a Manticore that's
going to a Wesen for a fortune,

16:51.160 --> 16:52.286
the Woge is not gonna work.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.521
He'd know he's being scammed.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.726
Sounds like motive.

16:54.800 --> 16:55.881
He was pissed.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.530
Unless it's
a Wesen Council thing.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.681
A what?

16:58.760 --> 16:59.960
Not everything's in the books.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.641
Monroe, you back?

17:03.080 --> 17:04.888
Yeah, just got in.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.242
We had an awesome time, but,
you know, glad to be back.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.481
Great.

17:09.560 --> 17:10.891
Yeah, no,
just checking in and...

17:10.960 --> 17:12.803
Can Hank and I come by?
We need your help.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.086
What, now?

17:14.160 --> 17:16.401
Well, if you're not too busy.
Uh...

17:16.680 --> 17:18.522
No, we're not so busy right now.

17:18.640 --> 17:19.925
Great.
We're on our way.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.048
Yeah, okay, well, see you.

17:22.119 --> 17:24.202
Nick and Juliette coming over?

17:24.480 --> 17:26.209
More like Nick and Hank.

17:26.280 --> 17:28.009
That didn't take long.

17:29.240 --> 17:30.651
It's no castle.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.049
It's no dungeon either.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.248
Aren't we glad to be
done with all that?

17:35.320 --> 17:36.845
I may never forgive you.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.968
Perhaps this will help you.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.405
Reconciliation.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.525
You did all this for me?

17:53.520 --> 17:54.681
Why wouldn't I?

17:54.800 --> 17:56.962
We're in this together,
aren't we?

17:57.600 --> 17:58.886
How do you mean that?

17:58.960 --> 18:01.008
Simmer down,
I have my own bedroom.

18:03.160 --> 18:05.891
Well, this is all very beautiful,
but when do we get serious?

18:06.040 --> 18:08.168
Don't make the mistake
of thinking we're not.

18:08.360 --> 18:11.728
We did not come all this way
again to go back empty handed.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.962
No, we did not.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.324
I suggest we start meeting with
our people sometime tomorrow.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.640
They're anxious to get going.

18:23.720 --> 18:24.881
Tomorrow would be fine.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.281
No... Let me.

18:27.360 --> 18:28.646
Sir...
Oh, come on,

18:28.720 --> 18:31.451
I never get to open
the doors in my own home.

18:31.520 --> 18:32.851
It'll be a thrill.

18:37.720 --> 18:41.327
Cousin Sean, I didn't
expect you so soon.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.044
I didn't expect
you so soon either.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.686
Do come in.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.161
This is familiar.

18:51.240 --> 18:53.242
Reminds me of when my
brother Eric came to town.

18:53.360 --> 18:56.125
Did you ever find his killer?

18:56.200 --> 18:57.645
Not yet.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.449
But we haven't given up.

18:59.520 --> 19:00.965
We believe it's
a man named Meisner.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.405
Perhaps you know him.

19:04.320 --> 19:05.481
Where's Adalind?

19:05.560 --> 19:07.289
Here.

19:11.440 --> 19:12.726
I didn't think
you'd ever come back.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.200
I didn't think
you'd steal our baby.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.004
Before this becomes a domestic,

19:16.080 --> 19:18.765
shall we put the past aside
and discuss the future?

19:22.560 --> 19:26.007
Last time you were in town, you
threatened to kill me and my mother.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.560
And that's a little
hard to put aside.

19:27.880 --> 19:30.008
Heat of the moment,
things get said.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.244
But I'm not here for revenge.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.765
I underestimated you
and I regret that mistake.

19:38.440 --> 19:39.521
I don't have the child.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.011
You gave her to Nick's mother!

19:41.080 --> 19:42.684
That's a little
hard to put aside too.

19:42.760 --> 19:44.603
I gave her to the one person
I thought would protect her.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.210
I wonder what
the Resistance would say

19:46.280 --> 19:47.611
if they knew
you'd betrayed them.

19:47.680 --> 19:48.727
But they do know.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.245
And I'll tell you
what I told them.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.765
I don't know where the child is,

19:51.840 --> 19:53.285
and I have no
way of finding out.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.161
No.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.444
We're going to remain civil.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.727
At least for a little while.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.325
You're the Captain of
a police department.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.209
You have means at your disposal.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.044
I suggest you make use of them.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.282
We're not leaving
without the child.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.286
You may not like it,

20:14.200 --> 20:16.771
but you're part of the family,
mistreated though you were,

20:16.840 --> 20:18.251
you still have the blood.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.281
Hasn't exactly been
thicker than water, has it?

20:21.520 --> 20:23.727
No family is perfect.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.246
But those that
wanted you dead are dead.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.971
And it's time you think about your
relationship with this family

20:29.080 --> 20:30.730
as it is now,

20:30.800 --> 20:32.484
not as it was then.

20:42.760 --> 20:44.285
Welcome to Portland.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.721
Well, we've broken the ice.
Let's have lunch.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.286
It's like we never left.

20:58.680 --> 20:59.727
Welcome back!

20:59.800 --> 21:01.450
Good to have you
two back.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.000
- Portland wasn't the same without you.
- Oh.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.241
Welcome back.
Thank you.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.368
How are you with all this?

21:07.480 --> 21:09.562
I'm getting through it.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.286
So, what do you got?

21:12.360 --> 21:13.361
Manticore.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.043
Another one?
That's what I said.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.920
I mean, they're just
about impossible to kill.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.843
Well, this one killed
two people last night.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.240
We also think
the vics were Wesen.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.486
We don't know for sure?

21:22.560 --> 21:23.800
Well, they were dead.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.882
They were
fortune tellers.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.411
We interviewed their last client

21:27.480 --> 21:29.721
and she described
what sounded like a Woge.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.643
During the fortune telling?
Yeah.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.928
Then my guess is, they
were breaking Council law.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.047
Oh, boy.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.326
So this could have
been a sanctioned hit.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.249
- If they were on the list.
- List?

21:39.400 --> 21:40.400
There's a list?

21:40.440 --> 21:43.284
The Council keeps records of
Wesen who violate Council law.

21:43.360 --> 21:45.806
Sometimes they send out their
own people, like Alexander,

21:45.880 --> 21:47.564
sometimes they use Marechaussee.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.524
Marechaussee are only
in it for the money.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.887
I mean, strictly mercenary.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.121
They're basically
bounty hunters.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.361
Wesen bounty hunters?

21:54.440 --> 21:56.488
Yeah. Big money.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.005
Not much of
a health plan, but...

21:58.080 --> 22:01.368
Nick, if this is Wesen Council,
I'd just stay out of it.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.883
As a Grimm, maybe,
but not as a cop.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.727
Well, at least let me see what I
can find out from the Council.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.166
Whoa.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.930
Juliette!
Yeah?

22:33.840 --> 22:34.841
Ow.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.043
What happened?
I hit my head.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.043
I'm sorry. On what?

22:43.320 --> 22:44.685
Stupid pepper mill.

22:49.960 --> 22:51.928
You hit your head
on the pepper mill?

22:52.960 --> 22:57.363
Yeah. I dropped the fork and
then I bent over to pick it up,

22:57.480 --> 23:00.484
and hit the side of the stove
and it fell on my head.

23:00.640 --> 23:01.926
Ooh.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.001
It's quite a bump.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.403
Yeah. I'll be okay.

23:09.960 --> 23:12.611
Casey, talk to me!

23:12.680 --> 23:14.125
Casey!

23:14.200 --> 23:15.565
I can't do this anymore.

23:15.640 --> 23:16.607
Oh, what, you don't love me?

23:16.680 --> 23:18.091
Don't say that, Casey.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.889
This is interesting. Now
you're telling me what to say?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.128
It's not like that. I'm
just so tired of being...

23:27.560 --> 23:29.324
You know what I can do to you.

23:29.400 --> 23:32.483
Yes, yes. Please.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.244
You still tired?

23:34.320 --> 23:37.642
No, no, I'll work.
I'll do whatever you say.

23:43.520 --> 23:46.251
You're gonna work twice as
hard tonight and prove it.

23:53.760 --> 23:54.841
Yeah, baby.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.087
See, I got two hot ones.
You're gonna love the love.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.161
Hey.

23:59.240 --> 24:00.287
Yo, hang on.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.449
Hey, big man, you looking
for a good time?

24:02.520 --> 24:03.601
No, I'm working.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.125
Then quit wastin' my time.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.605
Some weirdo in the alleyway...

24:07.680 --> 24:08.727
Hey.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.800
Yo, what the hell's
the matter with you?

24:42.800 --> 24:45.883
Rosalee Calvert,
your identity is confirmed.

24:46.720 --> 24:48.165
What are you reporting?

24:48.240 --> 24:50.163
I'm not actually
reporting anything,

24:50.240 --> 24:53.767
I have a question about two Wesen
deaths in Portland last night.

24:54.080 --> 24:56.082
Were they sanctioned
by the Council?

24:57.280 --> 25:00.090
Is there a Marechaussee
in Portland?

25:02.040 --> 25:04.850
The Council will
review your request.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.001
What'd they say?

25:11.360 --> 25:13.681
Not much. They said they'll
review my request.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.367
I'm thinking, maybe we
shouldn't have asked that.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.763
I guess we're gonna find out.

25:23.120 --> 25:25.361
Looks like our vics were living
pretty much off the grid.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.364
No bank accounts,
no tax returns.

25:28.440 --> 25:29.885
I can't find
a vehicle registration

25:29.960 --> 25:31.485
or a driver's
license for either one.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.887
Sounds like people who don't
wanna be found to me.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.406
Well, except
the bounty hunter did.

25:36.480 --> 25:38.369
I need to see you both.

25:41.960 --> 25:43.166
We got a problem?

25:43.240 --> 25:44.526
We do.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.890
My cousin Viktor is back
in town, with Adalind.

25:48.960 --> 25:49.961
- You've seen them?
- I have.

25:50.040 --> 25:52.407
They know about your mother, and
that we gave my child to her.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.080
So they think we
know where she is.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.122
I don't think they
care whether we do or not.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.726
But they made it very clear they're
not leaving without Diana.

25:58.800 --> 26:01.007
So I suggest you tell Juliette,
and watch your backs.

26:01.120 --> 26:04.602
I don't know when or where,
but they will make a move.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.769
How long is Henry
gonna have to keep this on?

26:14.840 --> 26:17.491
Until the stitches are out
and completely healed.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.085
I'm sorry, Henry,
but that's the way

26:19.160 --> 26:21.401
it's got to be until
you're feeling better.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.766
These are his meds.

26:22.840 --> 26:25.605
It's gonna be one a day,
preferably at night.

26:25.680 --> 26:26.966
Thanks.

26:27.040 --> 26:30.203
All right, big boy.
You're all done.

26:30.280 --> 26:31.805
Okay.

26:34.320 --> 26:35.845
Bye.

26:38.480 --> 26:39.480
Nick, you home?

26:39.520 --> 26:41.443
No, still at work.

26:41.520 --> 26:42.760
Yeah, me too.
I'm almost done though.

26:42.840 --> 26:44.126
You want me to
pick up some food?

26:44.200 --> 26:46.407
Juliette, Adalind is back
in Portland.

26:46.520 --> 26:49.524
What? Yeah, the
Captain just told me.

26:49.600 --> 26:50.761
You need to be careful.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.047
Give me a half hour. I wanna
get home before you do.

26:53.600 --> 26:54.965
Okay.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.245
Juliette?

27:36.440 --> 27:38.681
You all right?
No! Not with Adalind back.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.484
She's in town with Viktor.

27:40.560 --> 27:41.891
They know my mom has Diana.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.007
We have to warn her.

27:43.080 --> 27:44.889
I just sent her an email. I don't
know if she'll get it or...

27:44.960 --> 27:48.681
If Adalind tries anything, I swear
to God I will rip her throat out.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.081
Well, that might be a little
easier said than done.

27:52.160 --> 27:53.321
She's a Hexenbiest.

27:53.680 --> 27:55.125
I know what she is.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.320
It's from my mom.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.442
"Got your message."
There's an attachment.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.524
Oh, my God, that's Diana.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.206
She's beautiful.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.121
She looks so happy.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.360
Yeah, my mom's getting
a chance to be a mom again.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.411
Yeah?

28:21.480 --> 28:23.130
I just got home.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.449
Yeah, I can be
there in 10 minutes.

28:28.600 --> 28:31.251
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

28:31.320 --> 28:33.129
You gonna be okay?
I'll be fine.

28:34.120 --> 28:35.246
You know, be careful.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.450
- Hello?
- Rosalee Calvert?

28:45.960 --> 28:49.726
Uh... Yeah, she's...
She's right here.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.409
It's them.
I think the Council.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.971
This is Rosalee Calvert.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.121
The Council has determined

28:59.200 --> 29:02.409
that you shall take no further
action with regard to your inquiry.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.960
The Council is aware of your
relationship with the Grimm,

29:05.040 --> 29:08.203
who has interfered with the
Council on numerous occasions,

29:08.920 --> 29:12.242
therefore you are advised
not to assist him in any way.

29:12.320 --> 29:15.847
If there is any violation,
penalties will be imposed.

29:15.960 --> 29:19.442
There will be no further
communication on this subject.

29:35.800 --> 29:39.043
Pretty significant record if you're
interested, but it's mostly vice stuff.

29:39.120 --> 29:40.884
Started pimping
about six years ago,

29:40.960 --> 29:43.850
based on his first
pandering charge.

29:43.920 --> 29:46.605
Not sure who
that belongs to yet.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.768
- Run the numbers and check for prints.
- Yeah.

29:48.840 --> 29:51.446
I guess our bounty
hunter hasn't left town.

29:51.560 --> 29:54.160
One of his girls was working the
corner, she witnessed the attack.

29:54.200 --> 29:56.521
We found her hiding behind a
dumpster, pretty freaked out.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.090
Not sure she's
gonna be much help.

29:58.160 --> 30:01.721
She is positive she just saw
the devil in the flesh.

30:01.920 --> 30:03.760
Not that far from the truth.

30:05.800 --> 30:06.801
Rosalee?

30:06.880 --> 30:08.291
We just heard back
from the Council.

30:08.360 --> 30:09.360
It's not good, dude.

30:09.400 --> 30:10.447
What'd they say?

30:10.520 --> 30:12.329
They basically told us to
stay out of their business.

30:12.400 --> 30:15.643
Like, totally out of it,
including not helping you.

30:15.720 --> 30:18.040
And they said there would be
penalties if we didn't comply.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.161
So the Council
sanctioned the kills.

30:19.240 --> 30:20.287
Whatever.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.601
Suffice it to say,
they know what's going on.

30:22.720 --> 30:23.880
Well, we've got another body.

30:23.920 --> 30:24.921
Oh, God, Nick.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.287
If this is a Wesen bounty
hunter, he's still working.

30:27.360 --> 30:31.331
Look, you two stay out of
this, let us deal with it.

30:31.400 --> 30:34.370
I'm sorry. I know this isn't a nice
way to come back from a honeymoon.

30:34.440 --> 30:37.842
Nick, seriously! You don't wanna
piss off the Wesen Council.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.888
Not any more than
you already have.

30:40.160 --> 30:42.561
Can't you find somebody else
to handle this one?

30:42.640 --> 30:44.165
Well, you know
that's not gonna happen.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.685
I do.
I do know that.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.003
Be on your guard, okay?

30:48.080 --> 30:50.811
If they're using a Marechaussee,
killing is their business.

30:50.880 --> 30:52.370
He's not gonna
let you arrest him.

30:52.440 --> 30:53.680
So just be careful, Nick.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.046
Yeah.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.680
We have a determination
on Nicholas Burkhardt?

31:01.760 --> 31:03.444
Apparently.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.281
What have they decided?

31:08.360 --> 31:11.569
They decided he's
interfered once too often.

31:13.280 --> 31:14.770
Do you agree with this decision?

31:15.440 --> 31:19.365
Unfortunately, no one is
interested in my opinion.

31:19.480 --> 31:20.641
They're making a mistake.

31:20.720 --> 31:23.610
No one is interested
in your opinion either.

31:45.080 --> 31:47.287
Toxicity reports
concludes the victims died

31:47.360 --> 31:50.762
from an "Excessive dose of
neuro-toxins and enzyme inhibitors

31:50.840 --> 31:53.241
"associated with
the family Buthidae,

31:53.320 --> 31:54.606
"the closest match being..."

31:54.680 --> 31:55.806
Scorpion venom.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.928
We definitely got
ourselves a Manticore.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.401
Gentlemen, we have
hit a little pay dirt.

32:00.520 --> 32:02.204
Not one, but two clear prints,

32:02.280 --> 32:04.408
one not belonging to the
owner of the cell phone.

32:04.480 --> 32:06.767
And we were able to get a match.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.924
Mr. Jonathon Wilde,
from Archer City, Texas.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.607
Two arrests, one for murder,
identified by witnesses,

32:14.680 --> 32:16.569
but charges were dropped
due to lack of evidence

32:16.640 --> 32:18.642
and no known association
with his victims.

32:18.720 --> 32:19.801
How did the victim die?

32:19.880 --> 32:23.123
Neuro-toxins and enzyme
inhibitors associated with...

32:23.200 --> 32:24.486
Scorpions.

32:24.560 --> 32:27.291
Okay, we've got our guy.
What do we know?

32:27.360 --> 32:29.522
Well, I did a little
looking into this type of hit,

32:29.600 --> 32:30.965
and pulled up half a dozen

32:31.040 --> 32:34.203
scattered from Bangor, Maine to San
Diego, California, all unsolved.

32:34.280 --> 32:37.409
But I did manage to find motor
vehicles registered to Wilde.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.244
One for a motorcycle,
one for a truck.

32:39.320 --> 32:40.401
APBs on both.

32:40.520 --> 32:41.521
Make sure it goes wide,

32:41.600 --> 32:43.284
in case he's on his way
back to Texas. Yep.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.886
At least this time we've got
prints tying him to the scene.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.049
This is everything I know
about Kelly Burkhardt.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.009
Only photos of her
are over 20 years old.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.447
There's no driver's license
or passport in her name.

33:04.520 --> 33:06.921
And the last documentation
is of her death.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.331
But she is still alive.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.640
Very much so.

33:09.720 --> 33:13.167
She was last seen driving
a 2008 Ford F-250 crew cab,

33:13.240 --> 33:15.925
Oregon DOV 4-12, registered
to Juliette Silverton.

33:16.280 --> 33:19.011
Burkhardt could be
a long way away by now.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.445
I'm sure that's what
she'd like us to think.

33:20.560 --> 33:23.086
Although my gut feeling
is that she's close by.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.810
She's got a six-month-old
girl with her.

33:24.880 --> 33:26.405
If I find them, how do you
want me to handle it?

33:26.760 --> 33:28.649
Just tell me where she is.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.085
I don't want her to
know she's been found.

33:30.240 --> 33:31.366
See what I can do.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.010
Just watch your moves.
There's a lot

33:33.080 --> 33:34.570
of other interest in
the same subject matter.

33:34.640 --> 33:37.849
And Sam, one more
thing you should know.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.445
What?

33:39.640 --> 33:41.449
She's a Grimm.

33:42.560 --> 33:44.085
Good to know.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.486
We got a match
on the motorcycle.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.840
Did you check room registration?

33:52.240 --> 33:53.446
Okay, stay put.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.520
Do not engage the suspect
unless he tries to leave.

33:55.560 --> 33:57.847
Consider him
armed and dangerous.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.410
We got a match on
Wilde's motorcycle.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.642
He's at the Beacon Motel,
room 12.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.609
We won't know if it's our guy
until you make him Woge.

34:03.680 --> 34:05.409
I'll make him Woge.

34:29.639 --> 34:30.687
Down on the ground, now!

34:30.960 --> 34:32.882
On the ground!

34:33.000 --> 34:34.239
You're under arrest for murder.

34:34.320 --> 34:35.719
You have the right
to remain silent.

34:35.800 --> 34:36.847
Anything you say
can and will be used

34:36.920 --> 34:38.603
against you in the court of law.
You killed three people.

34:38.719 --> 34:40.290
You have the right to an attorney.
What are you doing?

34:40.320 --> 34:41.969
I didn't do anything. If you
cannot afford an attorney,

34:42.000 --> 34:43.489
one will be provided for you.
'Cause you're a Manticore.

34:43.639 --> 34:45.880
What?
What you're talking about?

34:45.960 --> 34:47.485
Did he Woge?
Not yet!

34:48.520 --> 34:50.329
Nick!

34:50.440 --> 34:51.601
Why are you doing this?

34:51.679 --> 34:53.011
I know what you are!

34:53.400 --> 34:55.447
Hey, Nick!
That's enough!

34:55.520 --> 34:57.170
He's under arrest.
We're taking him in.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.323
What if he's the wrong guy?

35:05.520 --> 35:06.760
What if he's not the Manticore?

35:06.840 --> 35:08.251
He is the Manticore.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.044
Then why didn't he Woge? He
doesn't know you're a Grimm.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.770
He's a professional.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.804
He's smart.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.643
I'll get him to Woge.

35:20.280 --> 35:21.850
Has this ever happened before?

35:22.320 --> 35:23.367
Not that I know of.

35:23.440 --> 35:25.169
What if he's wrong this time?

35:25.240 --> 35:27.447
All we've really got
is one fingerprint.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.722
That doesn't prove
he's the Manticore.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.523
I better go in there.

35:36.680 --> 35:37.841
We have your fingerprint,

35:37.920 --> 35:39.809
puts you at
the scene of the crime.

35:39.880 --> 35:41.120
What scene of the crime?

35:43.360 --> 35:45.966
How much was he worth?

35:46.080 --> 35:47.241
Uh, how much did you get paid?

35:47.280 --> 35:49.647
I didn't get paid anything!

35:50.240 --> 35:52.402
All right, look,

35:52.480 --> 35:54.847
I paid for a hooker tonight,
if that's what this is about.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.160
But I didn't kill anybody!

35:56.240 --> 35:58.004
You kill people for a living.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.006
You're a bounty hunter,

36:00.080 --> 36:02.560
a Marechaussee, and you
work for the Wesen Council.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.808
What are you talking about, man?
You're crazy!

36:05.240 --> 36:06.924
Nick!

36:07.440 --> 36:08.965
Let's just lock him up.

36:09.040 --> 36:11.407
I didn't do anything wrong!

36:11.520 --> 36:14.000
This isn't right.
I'm innocent.

36:14.080 --> 36:15.127
You're making a mistake.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.202
Do not go near this guy
under any circumstances.

36:17.320 --> 36:19.163
You understand?
Yes, sir.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.763
Now we can only
hold him so long.

36:22.840 --> 36:25.002
We have to figure
how we're gonna charge him.

36:25.120 --> 36:26.963
If you're sure
he's the right guy.

36:27.760 --> 36:28.760
I don't know.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.724
I just cracked Wilde's iPad.
You gotta see this.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.929
That puts him at the crime scenes.
That may be all we need.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.128
Hold on.
You gotta see this.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.681
That's why he didn't Woge.

36:51.760 --> 36:54.127
He knows who you are.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.721
You're crying?
Seriously?

37:04.800 --> 37:06.245
I don't feel so good.

37:06.320 --> 37:07.810
Well, let me get
you some warm milk.

37:25.920 --> 37:26.921
All right.

37:27.920 --> 37:29.410
Relax.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.006
Eww!

37:38.080 --> 37:39.525
So ugly.

37:46.320 --> 37:47.685
Henrietta?

37:48.760 --> 37:50.205
Now?

37:51.800 --> 37:53.404
Guess that's a now.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.441
I've never seen
anything like this before.

38:04.440 --> 38:08.206
I'm not sure how deep it
goes, or if it even stopped.

38:08.320 --> 38:09.321
What is it?

38:09.400 --> 38:12.449
It's what happens when the
syncretization doesn't syncretize.

38:12.560 --> 38:13.721
What did this?

38:14.680 --> 38:15.681
You.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.845
This is how powerful you are.

38:20.920 --> 38:23.127
No, I said I didn't want this.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.326
You don't have a choice!

38:24.400 --> 38:25.401
What?

38:25.480 --> 38:27.960
You are what you are now.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.041
No. No!

38:29.160 --> 38:31.561
And there's nothing
we can do to change that.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.483
I know this is not
what you wanna hear.

38:33.560 --> 38:35.130
Not what I wanna hear?

38:35.240 --> 38:36.241
Are you kidding?

38:41.240 --> 38:43.811
You must learn to
control yourself!

38:43.920 --> 38:48.244
Now don't forget, they used
to burn witches at the stake.

38:48.320 --> 38:50.288
So this is what I
am now, forever?

38:50.360 --> 38:53.011
There's nothing anyone can
do to change that, Juliette.

38:53.440 --> 38:55.169
You have to learn
to live with it.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.287
No. No!

39:07.320 --> 39:09.527
Photographs don't
prove he killed anybody.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.568
Well, they prove he
was at both crime scenes.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.165
I'm not sure that matters, Nick.

39:13.240 --> 39:14.765
Can't get a conviction
on a Manticore.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.600
I'm more worried about the Wesen
Council putting a hit on Nick.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.601
Suspect got out.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.964
He'll be coming after you, Nick.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.328
I'm going home.
Juliette's there.

39:36.920 --> 39:38.365
Nick, I really need
to talk to you.

39:38.480 --> 39:39.606
There's a guy after me.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.205
He probably won't
come to the house,

39:41.280 --> 39:42.725
but I'm not taking any chances.

39:42.800 --> 39:43.881
I'm on my way home.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.883
Okay, the doors are locked,
I'll get my gun. Aah.

39:45.960 --> 39:48.088
If you wanna see
her alive, come alone.

39:48.720 --> 39:49.721
Juliette?

39:51.320 --> 39:52.481
Juliette!

39:52.560 --> 39:53.561
Get out.

39:53.640 --> 39:54.880
I'm not here for you.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.201
Behave yourself and
you won't get hurt.

39:57.840 --> 39:59.365
I said get the hell out.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.404
This is my business.

40:01.480 --> 40:02.606
Stay out of it.

40:05.520 --> 40:06.601
I warned you.

40:09.560 --> 40:10.561
Maybe you're right.

40:11.880 --> 40:14.167
Maybe he should come home
and find you dead.

40:17.680 --> 40:18.920
Oh, my God!

40:19.000 --> 40:21.321
Easier to kill
a Grimm when he's emotional.

40:27.640 --> 40:29.961
Maybe he should come home
and find you dead!

41:02.160 --> 41:03.730
Juliette! Where is he?

41:11.600 --> 41:12.601
What the hell happened?

41:16.560 --> 41:17.641
He missed.

41:21.680 --> 41:22.727
I was lucky.

41:24.240 --> 41:26.720
I am so sorry.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.240
This never should've happened.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.805
And I swear to God,

41:34.040 --> 41:35.610
it's never gonna happen again.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.721
You can't protect me, Nick.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.771
That's something I'm gonna
have to do for myself.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.650
Come in!

41:58.040 --> 42:00.771
You've heard from our
bounty hunter? Yes.

42:01.480 --> 42:03.130
The Grimm is dead?

42:03.600 --> 42:04.647
Not exactly.

42:07.200 --> 42:11.967
Well, I hope the Council
doesn't take this personally.

42:14.920 --> 42:16.570
Or the Grimm.
