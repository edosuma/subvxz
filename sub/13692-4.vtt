WEBVTT

00:06.945 --> 00:10.615
Ah. Ah, thanks, Robbie.
A wonderful job, as ever.

00:10.698 --> 00:13.493
Thank you very much, sir.

00:13.576 --> 00:16.870
Next.

00:16.953 --> 00:20.665
-Er, actually, I think
I'll come back another time.
-ROBBIE: As you wish.

00:20.749 --> 00:24.126
Would any of you gentlemen
be wanting
something for the weekend?

00:24.210 --> 00:25.961
The usual, Robbie.

00:26.045 --> 00:28.171
A six-pound line
and a packet of hooks.

00:28.254 --> 00:32.092
Well, who'd have thought it?
A grown man frightened
of having his hair cut.

00:32.174 --> 00:34.927
I don't mind having a haircut,
I just don't want that one.

00:35.010 --> 00:37.846
We're going to a funeral.
It's a mark of respect.
Speak to him, Golly.

00:37.930 --> 00:40.765
I think he's old
enough to know his own mind.

00:40.848 --> 00:42.475
Where is Duncan?

00:42.558 --> 00:45.019
Can I help? Only you look
lost.

00:45.103 --> 00:47.354
No, I'm, er,
just waiting for my mother.

00:47.437 --> 00:49.690
DUNCAN: You're up
here on holiday I expect?

00:49.773 --> 00:51.649
My grandad's
being buried today.

00:51.732 --> 00:56.654
Oh, sorry.
Hey, not Howard McRaith?
I'm coming to that myself.

00:56.737 --> 00:58.321
(CAR ARRIVING)

00:58.405 --> 01:01.366
Er, well,
I'm sure you'll be
a great comfort to us all.

01:01.991 --> 01:03.450
Gotta go.

01:06.412 --> 01:08.706
Probably see you there, then.

01:19.881 --> 01:24.343
-Who's your friend?
-She didn't say.
Pretty lassie, though, eh?

01:24.427 --> 01:26.429
Doesn't take after
her father, then.

01:26.512 --> 01:27.887
Who's he?

01:27.971 --> 01:29.889
You're looking at him.

02:10.923 --> 02:14.218
You're joking, aren't you?
And you can forget that.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.928
And we certainly
don't need this.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.348
(SIGHING) Dublin Bay oysters?

02:19.431 --> 02:22.516
You put those on the order
and they come
straight out of your wages.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.895
That is Hector's Friday treat.
Tell her, Arch.

02:25.978 --> 02:29.147
Oh, I'm sure he can manage
without. We all have to
make sacrifices.

02:29.230 --> 02:32.901
Oh, thanks. For nothing.

02:39.197 --> 02:42.075
A bill from the florist?

02:42.157 --> 02:44.285
Yeah, I ordered
a wreath for the, er, funeral.

02:44.369 --> 02:46.453
Oh, sorry,
Archie, personal expenditure.

02:46.536 --> 02:48.705
You know the rules,
they're the same for everyone.

02:48.789 --> 02:50.666
I suppose so.
Technically, yes.

02:50.749 --> 02:52.333
But I thought since you're
staying here now, there might

02:52.416 --> 02:54.752
be room for a bit of give and
take.

02:54.835 --> 02:57.462
You scratch my back,
I'll scratch
yours sort of thing.

02:57.545 --> 03:00.006
Except I don't have an itch.

03:01.424 --> 03:02.926
Right.

03:06.929 --> 03:08.639
(DUNCAN CLEARING THROAT)

03:08.722 --> 03:11.766
-Is my tie straight?
-Who am I, your mother?

03:13.476 --> 03:15.686
Sorry. You look fine.

03:18.146 --> 03:20.816
Did Archie tell you who we saw
in the village this morning?

03:20.899 --> 03:22.775
Are you joking?

03:22.858 --> 03:26.320
Why would he confide in me
when Wonder Woman's got her
feet under the table?

03:26.404 --> 03:29.447
I don't think Archie
likes Stella living here
any more than you do.

03:29.531 --> 03:33.492
Come on.
She says, "Jump,"
and he asks, "Oh, how high?"

03:36.203 --> 03:38.038
I was looking for
the utility room.

03:38.122 --> 03:39.956
Best of luck.

03:43.126 --> 03:45.086
Duncan?

03:45.168 --> 03:47.713
-The utility room?
-Where is it?

03:49.798 --> 03:52.591
Um, what is it?

03:52.675 --> 03:55.219
The place where
the washing machine lives.

03:55.302 --> 03:57.929
-Och, why didn't you say?
-I'll show her.

03:58.013 --> 04:00.974
-No, I don't mind...
-I said, I'll do it.

04:01.057 --> 04:02.684
This way.

04:09.023 --> 04:12.525
You can't be serious.
I think I'll use
the launderette.

04:12.608 --> 04:14.527
HECTOR: Lexie!

04:14.610 --> 04:19.447
Well, don't leave it too long,
there's already a bad
smell around this place.

04:23.075 --> 04:26.662
-Lexie!
-There is no need to get
yourself into a lather.

04:26.745 --> 04:28.079
You have plenty of other
things to wear.

04:28.163 --> 04:29.997
That's hardly the point,
is it?

04:30.081 --> 04:33.043
While we're at it,
let's do
something about your hair.

04:33.125 --> 04:35.753
Yes?

04:35.836 --> 04:38.922
-I thought you were
going to the funeral.
-I am.

04:39.006 --> 04:43.175
That's why I asked you to send
my mourning suit
to the cleaners.

04:43.259 --> 04:45.969
That is mourning as
in being a mourner.

04:46.053 --> 04:49.598
Not morning as in
"Good morning, Vicar."

04:49.681 --> 04:53.434
You want to think yourself
lucky. My suit never
came back at all.

04:53.517 --> 04:56.312
Could I make a wee suggestion?

04:56.395 --> 05:00.106
Next time,
sort it out yourselves.

05:00.190 --> 05:03.609
Do you know, I think
she's in a better mood today.

05:03.692 --> 05:07.196
-Maybe I'll...
Maybe I'll just not go.
-Golly, you have to.

05:07.279 --> 05:09.405
GOLLY: It might be
easier for everybody.

05:09.489 --> 05:13.242
Surely you want to find out
what sort of young woman
she's grown up into?

05:13.326 --> 05:17.204
This may well be
your only chance.

05:17.287 --> 05:19.164
I'll go and look
at my other jacket.

05:19.247 --> 05:21.874
Not to worry,
I'm sure Archie can
lend you something.

05:21.957 --> 05:25.169
-Yeah, of course.
-There, that's settled, then.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.754
Smart as you can.

05:30.340 --> 05:32.092
Spying now, are we?

05:32.175 --> 05:36.011
All right, calm down.
You nearly gave
me a heart attack.

05:36.095 --> 05:39.931
No more than you deserve.
Sneaking around
behind everybody's backs.

05:40.014 --> 05:44.852
I don't sneak anywhere.
I was looking for
the makings of a sandwich.

05:50.357 --> 05:51.899
Bread.

05:58.321 --> 06:00.699
-Cheese.
-Is that it?

06:00.782 --> 06:04.827
Have you not heard?
Apparently we're
on an economy drive.

06:15.252 --> 06:17.671
There we are,
could have been made for you.

06:17.754 --> 06:20.465
Now, I've got
a black tie here somewhere.

06:20.549 --> 06:22.341
Here it is.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.053
Jessica.

06:27.679 --> 06:31.182
-Sorry?
-Her name, Jessica.

06:31.266 --> 06:34.059
That's what you've
been wanting to ask me,
isn't it?

06:34.143 --> 06:38.105
And no, as far as I'm aware,
there are no other Mackenzie
offspring running around.

06:38.188 --> 06:39.689
She's the only one.

06:39.772 --> 06:41.858
So where have you
been hiding her?

06:41.941 --> 06:45.193
Well, apart from photographs,
that's the first time
I've seen her in 20 years.

06:45.277 --> 06:48.447
-And you're
sure that it's her?
-Oh, yes.

06:48.530 --> 06:51.949
It's her grandfather's
funeral we're going to.

06:52.033 --> 06:55.494
And that was Alison,
her mother, in the car.

06:55.577 --> 06:59.873
-I didn't even know
you'd been married.
-We weren't.

06:59.956 --> 07:04.959
Oh, I wanted to but Alison
knew she'd never be happy
as a highland wife.

07:05.044 --> 07:08.380
Too much world to see
out there, she said.

07:08.464 --> 07:13.176
Anyway, the pair of them went
off when the child was no more
than a couple of months old.

07:13.259 --> 07:16.511
And is Jessica
gonna know who you are?

07:16.595 --> 07:18.764
Only one way to find out.

07:31.441 --> 07:33.359
-Oh, I'm not early, am I?
-No.

07:33.442 --> 07:36.737
-I thought you'd be ready.
-I am.

07:36.820 --> 07:39.322
So, what do you think
of the new gas guzzler?

07:39.405 --> 07:41.491
Oh, it's a beauty, Kilwillie.

07:41.574 --> 07:45.619
Well, do you know, I'm
rather fond of her myself.

07:45.702 --> 07:49.665
-She turns quite a few heads,
I can tell you.
-Oh, I'm sure she does.

07:51.499 --> 07:54.418
Oh, yes.

07:54.502 --> 07:57.295
-Oh, yes!
-Do you want to
drive her to the church?

07:57.379 --> 07:59.214
-Really?
-Absolutely.

07:59.297 --> 08:00.966
You don't mind a bit of
a squeeze, do you, Molly?

08:01.049 --> 08:02.967
-When I can get one.
-What?

08:03.050 --> 08:05.094
We'll meet you
down at the bridge.

08:05.177 --> 08:08.722
I've suddenly got the fancy
to stretch the old legs a bit.

08:08.806 --> 08:10.932
Shall we perambulate, Hector?

08:11.015 --> 08:15.102
I need a word on the QT.
I've got some
rather splendid news.

08:15.185 --> 08:18.981
Well, I'd better put
the old bus to bed.

08:19.064 --> 08:22.984
You can leave it, Duncan.
I want to take a proper
look round the estate.

08:23.067 --> 08:26.320
Are you sure? She can
be awful temperamental.

08:26.404 --> 08:28.154
So can I.

08:28.238 --> 08:31.199
What would you say if I told
you you'd been nominated,
selected,

08:31.283 --> 08:35.660
voted on and
approved for membership
of The Highland Hundred?

08:35.744 --> 08:36.870
I'd say I'd never heard of it.

08:36.953 --> 08:38.831
Well, that's 'cause
it's a secret society.

08:38.913 --> 08:41.207
-The Highland Hundred?
-Shush!

08:41.291 --> 08:44.585
(WHISPERING) The Highland
Hundred has its roots in the

08:44.669 --> 08:46.628
Hellfire Club of the 18th
century.

08:46.712 --> 08:49.965
Men of means and
influence getting together
to let their hair down.

08:50.048 --> 08:53.175
Well, naturally it's
evolved a bit since then,
but membership still has,

08:53.258 --> 08:55.678
shall I say,
certain advantages.

08:55.761 --> 08:57.512
What sort of advantages?

08:57.595 --> 08:59.638
Well, I don't just mean
making the right contacts.

08:59.723 --> 09:03.058
I promise you, once you've
attended one of their
monthly bun fights,

09:03.142 --> 09:04.935
you will never miss another.

09:05.019 --> 09:08.938
Hector,
I am talking a luncheon
of Epicurean proportions,

09:09.022 --> 09:12.483
gourmet food,
fine wines, rare malts.

09:12.567 --> 09:15.527
And most importantly,
no fillies,

09:15.611 --> 09:20.073
so you can always loosen the
old trouser belt afterwards
without fear of reprisals.

09:20.157 --> 09:21.699
Sounds like heaven on earth.

09:21.782 --> 09:24.577
-Ooh, better than that.
-Why wait till now to ask me?

09:24.660 --> 09:27.704
Well, out of darkness cometh
light. It's only on
the death of a member

09:27.787 --> 09:29.873
-that we can
bring in fresh blood.
-I see.

09:29.956 --> 09:32.459
This chap, er, do I know him?

09:32.542 --> 09:34.877
Whose funeral do you
think we're going to?

09:34.960 --> 09:37.630
-Ah.
-Ah.

09:41.090 --> 09:42.634
(DOOR OPENING)

09:43.426 --> 09:44.636
Lex?

09:47.054 --> 09:49.264
We're, um, just about to go.

09:49.348 --> 09:52.850
You don't have to tell me
what you're doing, Arch.
Or who you're doing it with.

09:52.934 --> 09:56.520
If you're referring to Stella,
she has our best
interests at heart.

09:56.604 --> 09:59.689
-Didn't take you
long to change sides.
-We all have a part to play.

09:59.773 --> 10:02.775
And it's becoming
quite obvious what mine is.

10:02.858 --> 10:06.987
Don't worry, I'll just stay
down here. Out the way where I
can't upset anyone.

10:07.071 --> 10:11.032
You know how we stand. I can't
even buy a bag of nails
without her approval.

10:11.115 --> 10:13.201
It doesn't mean you had
to ask her to move in.

10:13.284 --> 10:16.828
Lex, if you could just see
that she gets what she needs.

10:19.039 --> 10:22.833
Of course. Seeing as
you asked so nicely.

10:22.917 --> 10:24.335
Thank you.

10:29.839 --> 10:32.175
KILWILLIE: You're back
in business then, old man?

10:32.259 --> 10:36.720
It's out of my hands, I'm
afraid. Take rather
a back seat these days.

10:36.804 --> 10:40.807
Probably for the best.
Marvellous job,
though, I have to say.

10:40.890 --> 10:44.102
Well, it should be.
That's
100-year-old seasoned oak.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.061
Whose word have we got
for that?

10:46.144 --> 10:49.898
Mine. I supplied it.
Stuart McIntosh.

10:49.982 --> 10:53.567
McIntosh! Do you realise
you're on MacDonald land?

10:53.651 --> 10:58.029
Hector,
this is the 21st century.
The clan wars are long over.

10:58.113 --> 11:00.240
"Reclaimed
building materials."

11:00.323 --> 11:02.117
I had a delivery
a couple of miles away

11:02.200 --> 11:04.535
so I thought I'd stop by
and see the finished article.

11:04.618 --> 11:06.120
Last you for generations,
this will.

11:06.203 --> 11:07.871
(TYRES SCREECHING)

11:07.955 --> 11:10.873
I rather think that's
about to be put to the test.

11:10.957 --> 11:15.252
-Who's this maniac?
-That maniac is
a loyal family retainer.

11:15.335 --> 11:19.214
He's driven across
this bridge more times
than you've had hot muffin.

11:21.966 --> 11:23.884
Watch out!

11:34.893 --> 11:39.230
Muscular, agile, dynamic.

11:39.314 --> 11:41.232
4.4 V8 engine.

11:41.316 --> 11:44.235
And a glove box big
enough to hold a jamboree in.

11:44.319 --> 11:46.320
After you, old man.

11:48.947 --> 11:51.240
No wonder we lost at Culloden.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.099
Can I help you?

12:22.183 --> 12:25.144
Er, yeah.
I was looking for the laird.

12:25.227 --> 12:27.062
Well,
you won't find him in there.

12:27.145 --> 12:29.773
Yeah, you're probably right.

12:29.856 --> 12:31.942
-Let me give you
a hand with those.
-It's okay.

12:32.025 --> 12:34.902
Ah, come on. It's just
so I can boast to my pals.

12:34.985 --> 12:36.695
What are you talking about?

12:36.779 --> 12:38.988
Well,
I can tell them, truthfully,

12:39.072 --> 12:41.658
that within a minute
of meeting
the most gorgeous woman,

12:41.741 --> 12:44.285
I had the clothes off her.

12:44.369 --> 12:47.371
Well,
in that case, be my guest.

12:47.454 --> 12:51.040
So, when's the best time
to come back
and catch the man?

12:51.123 --> 12:54.001
-Well,
you can come in and wait.
-You sure?

12:54.085 --> 12:56.628
I could do with the company.

13:00.423 --> 13:03.926
ALISON:
Thank you so much for coming.
I appreciate it. Thank you.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.845
Thanks. It's okay.

13:06.929 --> 13:08.514
Hello.

13:09.347 --> 13:10.515
Thank you.

13:10.598 --> 13:12.267
Hello, Alison.

13:13.935 --> 13:16.311
I was wondering
when you'd say hello.

13:18.522 --> 13:23.192
This is Golly. He's, um,
a very old friend of mine.

13:23.276 --> 13:26.028
-Hi.
-How are you?

13:26.112 --> 13:28.530
Me? Eh, I'm fine.

13:29.197 --> 13:30.365
Good.

13:32.325 --> 13:36.662
-ALISON: We're here
for a couple of days.
-Right.

13:36.745 --> 13:40.957
We ought to spend
some time together.
A lot of catching up to do.

13:41.040 --> 13:44.335
That would be very nice.

13:44.419 --> 13:47.254
Listen, I just wanted to
offer my condolences, Alison.

13:47.337 --> 13:49.965
Your... Your father
will be sorely missed.

13:50.548 --> 13:52.008
Thank you.

14:05.769 --> 14:08.439
Bit of a spook, isn't he?

14:08.521 --> 14:10.815
You just need to
get to know him.

14:11.524 --> 14:13.484
Hi.

14:13.568 --> 14:17.237
That older guy that father's
glad-handing, didn't he used
to be the local MP?

14:17.321 --> 14:20.365
Other one's a sheriff.
Gave me my
first speeding fine.

14:20.449 --> 14:22.408
Mmm, looks the type.

14:22.491 --> 14:26.370
-No news on the wake, then?
-For the last time, Hector,
they're not having one.

14:26.454 --> 14:28.163
It's a damn disgrace. Music
and dancing, that's what I

14:28.246 --> 14:30.165
want when I go, and plenty
of it.

14:30.248 --> 14:32.875
Oh, believe me,
dear, there will be.

15:07.154 --> 15:09.572
Oh, God.

15:09.656 --> 15:12.116
MOLLY: I just wanted to say
it was a lovely service and...

15:12.200 --> 15:13.868
JESSICA: Last night was
too creepy.

15:13.952 --> 15:17.204
Well, we'll try and find a
hotel then,

15:17.287 --> 15:20.040
but I don't
hold out much hope.

15:20.123 --> 15:22.500
-Mrs MacDonald.
-Alison.

15:22.583 --> 15:27.796
If we can't get anywhere,
I'd rather sleep in the car.
I mean it.

15:27.879 --> 15:30.840
She's getting a bit wobbly
about staying at
her grandad's place.

15:30.924 --> 15:32.633
No, I'm not.

15:32.716 --> 15:35.636
Well,
surely there must be someone
who can put you up?

15:35.719 --> 15:38.055
Any ideas, Golly?

15:39.764 --> 15:42.809
Well,
they'd be more than welcome
to stay at my cottage.

15:42.892 --> 15:45.561
Oh, aye. Will you
give them the west wing?

15:45.644 --> 15:48.438
-Yes, thank you, Duncan.
-No, really, there's
hardly room to swing a cat.

15:48.522 --> 15:51.482
Golly can bunk up with us.

15:51.566 --> 15:54.151
Well, in that case,
it sounds ideal.

16:00.949 --> 16:02.783
-Thanks, Duncan.
-Aye.

16:04.827 --> 16:06.662
No problem, Golly.

16:06.745 --> 16:08.289
The door's open.

16:10.039 --> 16:12.959
Come on and I'll
give you the grand tour.

16:13.042 --> 16:14.501
Can't wait.

16:21.674 --> 16:23.885
Good of you to do this.

16:23.968 --> 16:26.511
Well, she is my daughter.

16:26.595 --> 16:31.016
I wasn't sure how you'd
feel after all this time.

16:31.099 --> 16:33.767
Caused you a lot of pain
taking her away, I know.

16:33.851 --> 16:35.936
Well, I won't deny that.

16:37.354 --> 16:40.690
Listen, Alison,
will you tell me something?

16:40.773 --> 16:42.901
Was it worth it?

16:42.984 --> 16:46.361
You always could read my mind.

16:46.445 --> 16:49.114
There were things
she's missed out on.

16:49.198 --> 16:53.618
He never said but I know my
dad would have liked to
have seen more of her.

16:53.701 --> 16:56.162
It's too late now, though.

16:56.245 --> 16:59.039
But it's made me think.

16:59.122 --> 17:02.833
And I realise I've
given up any right I had
to ask for anything.

17:02.917 --> 17:04.792
Go on.

17:04.877 --> 17:06.628
But I'd like to
tell her the truth...

17:06.712 --> 17:08.421
(SIGHS)

17:08.503 --> 17:11.590
...about who you are.

17:11.674 --> 17:16.136
I mean,
really, do you really think
that's for the best?

17:16.220 --> 17:21.307
It's an opportunity to be
part of her life. Surely
you're not gonna say no.

17:21.390 --> 17:24.477
It's what I wanted
right from the beginning.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.895
So what is there to consider?

17:26.978 --> 17:30.315
Thinking and doing, Alison,
are two very
different animals.

17:31.900 --> 17:34.610
Just give her a chance
to get to know to you.

17:35.736 --> 17:37.112
Mmm.

17:39.239 --> 17:43.076
Right, erm, that one.

17:43.159 --> 17:45.327
-Wrong again. Ha!
-How do you do that?

17:45.410 --> 17:46.912
-Magic, my dear.
-No, it's cheat...

17:46.995 --> 17:48.371
(ARCHIE CLEARING THROAT)

17:48.455 --> 17:50.455
-Oh, Arch, you're back.
-Yeah.

17:50.540 --> 17:52.540
I'm not
disturbing anything, am I?

17:52.625 --> 17:55.628
No. This is Stuart.
He came to see you.

17:55.710 --> 17:59.714
Ah, the elusive laird.
It's a pleasure.

17:59.798 --> 18:02.508
I think we might be able
to do some business together.

18:02.591 --> 18:03.843
Here.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.557
STUART: Twelve years
I've been in salvage

18:10.640 --> 18:14.810
and I'm still surprised what
you can find just lying around
on these old estates.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.979
Do you know what that is?

18:17.062 --> 18:19.022
ARCHIE: Slate.

18:19.106 --> 18:21.065
A Ballachulish slate.

18:21.148 --> 18:25.903
They just don't make
them like this any more.
Look how fine the grain is.

18:25.987 --> 18:30.282
So, um, a derelict cottage,
for instance,
what might we be talking?

18:30.365 --> 18:34.618
Well, let's assume cut stone,

18:34.702 --> 18:39.247
flags, lintels, lead, timbers.

18:39.330 --> 18:43.293
Maybe a couple of
nice fireplaces.
Five, six hundred pounds?

18:43.376 --> 18:45.419
Nah, I think we're
wasting each other's time.

18:45.502 --> 18:48.422
Hold on, let's not be hasty.
Eight hundred.

18:48.505 --> 18:51.007
-Twelve.
-I could maybe go to nine.

18:51.090 --> 18:54.093
-How about a round thousand?
-You're on.

18:54.177 --> 18:56.261
-Cash.
-Of course.

18:56.344 --> 18:59.848
I can get a couple of trucks
up here tomorrow. You won't
even know we've been.

18:59.931 --> 19:01.683
That suits me fine.

19:01.766 --> 19:04.768
Archie, you could be
sitting on a little gold mine.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.938
Well, here's to the...

19:08.022 --> 19:09.105
Shh.

19:09.189 --> 19:10.940
(WHISPERING) Highland Hundred.

19:14.318 --> 19:17.237
Now, to business.
The bun fight.

19:17.321 --> 19:19.615
Have you had any
thoughts as to where exactly?

19:19.698 --> 19:21.782
Me? Why would I?

19:21.866 --> 19:25.244
Well, first time on parade,
the newest member
always plays host.

19:25.328 --> 19:27.954
-We'll be holding it here.
-Here?

19:28.038 --> 19:31.333
-It's a great honour.
-I'm sure it is, but
Archie wouldn't stand for it.

19:31.416 --> 19:35.294
Archie? My dear fellow,
nobody outside the Hundred
must have an inkling.

19:35.377 --> 19:39.464
You just cough up the cash
and leave the details
to those in the know.

19:39.547 --> 19:42.800
-Right. Cash?
-Or cheque.

19:42.884 --> 19:44.384
Oh. How much?

19:44.468 --> 19:46.887
Oh, two thou.

19:46.970 --> 19:51.015
-It won't be a problem,
will it?
-Oh, Kilwillie. Really.

19:55.978 --> 19:59.439
We only have to lose the odd
cottage to be looking at quite
a windfall, you know.

19:59.523 --> 20:01.650
Which Her Ladyship
need know nothing about.

20:01.733 --> 20:04.527
Right. They'd be gone
before she even
knew they were there.

20:04.610 --> 20:08.279
It's the one ace up our
sleeve, superior
knowledge of the estate.

20:08.363 --> 20:10.156
So what are you
gonna do with the money?

20:10.240 --> 20:13.451
Buy us a bit of freedom.
It means we don't have
to beg for every penny.

20:13.535 --> 20:15.994
Gets my vote. So where is he?

20:16.078 --> 20:18.247
-Who?
-Stuart.

20:18.330 --> 20:21.249
Oh, he's gone. Why?

20:21.332 --> 20:24.460
I dunno. Just thought
he might have said cheerio,
that's all.

20:24.544 --> 20:26.795
No, he shot straight off.

20:27.462 --> 20:28.922
Oh, well.

20:29.005 --> 20:31.591
He's a bit of
a chancer if you ask me.

20:31.675 --> 20:33.300
Is that right?

20:33.384 --> 20:36.178
Well, I'll let you
know after our date.

20:37.012 --> 20:38.721
What date?

20:38.805 --> 20:41.641
He's requested
the pleasure of my
company for dinner.

20:41.724 --> 20:42.725
Oh.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.772
(GRUNTING)

20:51.732 --> 20:52.942
Ah.

20:55.862 --> 20:57.904
Sorry,
Hector, the cupboard is bare.

20:57.988 --> 21:01.324
Do put everything
back where you found it,
won't you?

21:06.745 --> 21:08.955
GOLLY: Here you are.

21:09.038 --> 21:10.748
Thanks.

21:10.832 --> 21:13.501
Mmm, best china, too.
I'm honoured.

21:13.585 --> 21:16.795
Ah, I don't get an awful
lot of guests up here.

21:16.879 --> 21:20.131
Don't worry, I've
drunk out of a lot worse.

21:21.549 --> 21:23.176
Nice.

21:23.259 --> 21:27.220
Ah, it's been 15 years now.
Murray his name is.

21:27.304 --> 21:30.056
And he's not... He's
not come up with you, no?

21:30.140 --> 21:32.766
He thought it
best not to be here.

21:32.850 --> 21:36.145
And he's quite happy
for us to tell Jessica?

21:36.228 --> 21:41.065
Jessica knows he's her stepdad
and he understands
why I need to do this.

21:41.816 --> 21:43.776
Sounds like a nice guy.

21:44.359 --> 21:45.486
He is.

21:45.569 --> 21:47.237
What's happened
to the hot water?

21:47.321 --> 21:49.156
Oh,
you'll have run it all off.

21:49.239 --> 21:52.033
-But the bath's
only half full.
-That'll be about right.

21:52.116 --> 21:55.036
-You can manage, surely?
-I suppose I'll have to.

21:55.119 --> 21:59.498
Do you get electricity
out here or should we start
lighting the oil lamps?

21:59.581 --> 22:03.209
-This is Golly's home.
-Sorry.

22:03.292 --> 22:05.628
-It was a joke.
-I realise that.

22:05.711 --> 22:10.423
Listen, don't empty the bath
when you've finished. I've got
some underwear I need to soak.

22:10.507 --> 22:12.175
You are kidding?

22:14.968 --> 22:17.346
I deserved that, didn't I?

22:23.601 --> 22:25.394
Thank you, Duncan.

22:30.732 --> 22:35.236
Do you know how
many disused cottages
there are on this estate?

22:35.319 --> 22:37.655
What makes you say that?

22:37.738 --> 22:40.824
It's not a test.
Just take a guess.

22:41.407 --> 22:42.534
A few.

22:42.617 --> 22:46.328
So far I've found 10
which are just rubble,

22:46.411 --> 22:51.332
eight half-standing
and 14,
that with a bit of work,

22:51.415 --> 22:53.376
would make
excellent holiday homes.

22:53.459 --> 22:57.003
Em, have you counted the two
inside Wallace Wood?

22:57.087 --> 23:00.715
-I don't think I did.
-Duncan, haven't you
got something to do?

23:00.799 --> 23:05.094
-I was just trying to help.
-And you have.
That's excellent, Duncan.

23:07.847 --> 23:09.639
Don't you see?

23:09.722 --> 23:12.684
With the shortage of
local accommodation,
there's incredible potential.

23:12.767 --> 23:14.685
We have actually
been down that road,

23:14.768 --> 23:17.229
and any not already renovated
just aren't worth doing.

23:17.312 --> 23:18.939
Well, I don't agree.

23:19.022 --> 23:22.275
And first thing
in the morning,
I'm going to call a surveyor.

23:22.358 --> 23:25.319
Archie, you could be
sitting on a gold mine.

23:27.195 --> 23:30.323
Slight flaw in
the master plan?

23:32.032 --> 23:35.536
ALISON: She's eight in
that one. We were in Malta.

23:38.246 --> 23:42.625
If we're gonna do this,
it'll have to be soon.

23:42.709 --> 23:45.085
We can't put it
off much longer.

23:46.587 --> 23:50.006
-So who's gonna tell her?
-Tell me what?

23:50.089 --> 23:54.552
What's going on with you two?
You've been
acting odd all evening.

23:54.635 --> 23:57.387
Er, you might want
to sit down, lass.

23:57.471 --> 23:59.222
I'm all right here, thanks.

24:00.348 --> 24:01.932
Okay. Um...

24:03.767 --> 24:05.769
Your mother and me, we're...

24:06.979 --> 24:09.689
We're not just old friends.
We...

24:11.816 --> 24:14.610
We were involved for a while.

24:14.693 --> 24:16.361
Involved?

24:16.445 --> 24:20.072
-Whatever you want to call it.
-I really do not
need to know this.

24:20.156 --> 24:21.324
Yes, you do.

24:21.407 --> 24:23.534
What on earth for?

24:23.618 --> 24:25.036
Because...

24:26.578 --> 24:28.580
Golly's your father.

24:34.210 --> 24:35.961
-You?
-Yes.

24:38.505 --> 24:40.924
Well, nice timing, Mum.

24:41.007 --> 24:45.052
Thought this would cheer me up
after grandad's funeral,
did you?

24:45.135 --> 24:50.473
I didn't want you to go away
from here thinking you've got
no connections any more.

24:50.556 --> 24:55.061
One day you'll have kids of
your own and they'll want to
know where their roots lie.

24:55.144 --> 24:58.105
You could have saved
yourself the trouble.

24:58.188 --> 25:01.899
No wonder you've
never been able
to tell me before.

25:01.982 --> 25:05.319
Getting yourself
pregnant by a farm labourer.

25:05.402 --> 25:08.404
What are you gonna spring on
me next? The village
idiot's my half-brother?

25:08.488 --> 25:10.949
Look, I realise
I'm probably not
what you imagined.

25:11.032 --> 25:13.034
You've got that right.

25:13.118 --> 25:16.620
I don't know who
makes me more embarrassed,
you or her.

25:17.746 --> 25:19.414
Jessica, wait.

26:03.242 --> 26:07.455
Now why go to work on an egg
when it's quicker on a kipper?

26:08.246 --> 26:10.415
-Thank you.
-Okay.

26:10.498 --> 26:12.375
Molly.

26:12.459 --> 26:16.420
Now, for those of you who
don't know, I shall be dining
out this evening,

26:16.503 --> 26:18.046
so it'll be a cold supper.

26:18.130 --> 26:21.591
Not to worry, we'll manage.
Going somewhere nice?

26:21.674 --> 26:24.552
I'm going,
eh, with someone nice.

26:24.635 --> 26:28.764
Even better. Do I detect
a little romance in the air?

26:28.847 --> 26:31.433
Mmm, I could be tempted.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.188
Hi.

26:37.271 --> 26:41.483
Archie, I was just wondering
if you could do without me for
the rest of the day?

26:41.566 --> 26:43.485
I'd like to spend
a bit of time with Jessica.

26:43.568 --> 26:46.862
Yeah, take as much time as
you need. There's nothing
wrong, is there?

26:46.945 --> 26:48.947
Oh, no.

26:49.031 --> 26:52.241
It's just that I don't think
I'm quite what she
expected as a father.

26:52.325 --> 26:54.368
Well, tell her she
wants to try mine.

26:54.452 --> 26:57.746
-Thanks, Archie.
-Oh, Golly, you haven't
seen Stella, have you?

26:57.829 --> 26:59.498
No.

26:59.581 --> 27:03.584
I think she said something
about counting
some more cottages.

27:05.669 --> 27:07.046
Thanks, Lex.

27:10.840 --> 27:12.467
Stella.

27:12.550 --> 27:14.510
I thought I'd see
you at breakfast.

27:14.593 --> 27:16.929
It's okay,
I'll grab something later.

27:17.012 --> 27:19.223
The... The cottages...

27:19.306 --> 27:22.934
I ought to warn you,
they're like a lot of
structures on the estate.

27:23.017 --> 27:27.479
They, um, they look sturdy
but one strong gust of
wind and they'll blow over.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.149
-Isn't that right, Duncan?
-Er, no, not really.

27:31.233 --> 27:34.777
Like I was saying, the ones up
the long track,
they're in excellent nick.

27:34.860 --> 27:37.321
-Well, it's not
just the structure...
-You might as well stop there.

27:37.404 --> 27:39.781
I know why you're
so against the idea.

27:39.864 --> 27:42.242
-You do?
-It's the cost, isn't it?

27:42.325 --> 27:44.910
-Eh?
-That's what's
putting you off.

27:44.993 --> 27:48.247
One guy wanted four thousand
just to supply the slates.

27:48.330 --> 27:50.873
Exactly. How much?

27:50.957 --> 27:54.544
Â£4,000. All original,
though. Reclaimed.

27:54.627 --> 27:56.336
-Â£4,000?
-Yep.

27:56.420 --> 27:59.381
Apparently
architectural salvage
is the bandwagon to be on.

27:59.464 --> 28:01.299
There's people making
fortunes out of it.

28:01.383 --> 28:03.551
Yeah, I think I know one
of them.

28:03.634 --> 28:06.679
So we're, um, dropping
the whole renovation idea?

28:06.762 --> 28:09.514
No, we'll just buy new.
It's cheaper.

28:13.226 --> 28:16.186
Thank you, Duncan.
I knew I could rely on you.

28:17.229 --> 28:18.689
No problem.

28:21.691 --> 28:24.694
That's right, Â£2,000.

28:24.777 --> 28:27.112
Well, of course I'm serious.

28:27.195 --> 28:31.283
And you can tell whoever that
is, I can hear them
laughing in the background.

28:31.366 --> 28:33.576
I could do what?

28:33.659 --> 28:36.120
The same to you with knobs on.

28:36.203 --> 28:38.955
-Psst! Trouble?
-Wrong number.

28:43.709 --> 28:45.753
So what news?

28:47.045 --> 28:48.964
I've had a recce

28:49.047 --> 28:52.967
-and I think
the basement is our best bet.
-Ah.

28:53.050 --> 28:56.720
We could all
assemble down there
completely undetected,

28:56.803 --> 28:58.930
if you can get
the chaps in and out.

28:59.014 --> 29:00.932
You leave that to me.

29:03.017 --> 29:05.936
Your club tie. I thought
I'd deliver it personally.

29:06.020 --> 29:07.396
Jolly decent of you.

29:07.480 --> 29:09.189
Uh-uh, cheque first.

29:09.272 --> 29:12.192
Oh, well,
there's the rub, Kilwillie.

29:12.275 --> 29:16.653
Used the last one just
yesterday. There'll be a new
chequebook in the post,

29:16.737 --> 29:19.822
and the moment it arrives
I'll send one on to you.

29:19.906 --> 29:22.033
You don't have the necessary,
do you?

29:25.453 --> 29:27.329
No.

29:27.412 --> 29:31.041
Oh, it's nothing to
be embarrassed about.
It's not a problem at all.

29:31.124 --> 29:33.793
-I can still join?
-Oh,
no, I'm afraid not, old man.

29:33.876 --> 29:37.296
But the bun fight?
Surely you can't just cancel?

29:37.379 --> 29:39.005
No, we'll hold it at my place.

29:39.089 --> 29:41.508
No need for the rest of us
to miss out on the jollies.

29:41.591 --> 29:43.634
Rumour is it's
the finest feed ever.

29:43.717 --> 29:45.552
(CHUCKLING)

29:57.604 --> 29:59.439
I thought you were
staying another night.

29:59.523 --> 30:02.274
I'm out of here as
soon as Mum gets back.

30:02.358 --> 30:04.193
Well, she'll be a while.

30:04.276 --> 30:07.029
-How do you know?
-Because I asked her to.

30:09.447 --> 30:12.242
Look, I'm sorry about
last night, Jessica.

30:12.325 --> 30:16.036
Maybe we shouldn't
have sprung it on you
like we did,

30:16.120 --> 30:18.747
but it was what
your mother wanted.

30:18.831 --> 30:21.666
And, if I'm honest,
it was what I wanted as well.

30:21.749 --> 30:25.044
Bit late to be
part of my life.
You know nothing about me.

30:25.128 --> 30:27.629
(CHUCKLING) No, and you
know nothing about me,

30:27.712 --> 30:31.632
but I would like
the opportunity to find out,

30:31.716 --> 30:34.593
if you'll...
If you'll give me a chance.

30:45.352 --> 30:48.188
GOLLY:
Well, what do you think?
JESSICA: It's a boat.

30:48.272 --> 30:50.606
It's not a boat.
It's the boat.

30:50.690 --> 30:52.692
You don't recognise it?

30:52.775 --> 30:54.277
Is it...?

30:54.360 --> 30:57.028
It's the one your grandfather
taught you to row in. It's had

30:57.112 --> 30:59.406
a lick or two of paint since
then, though.

30:59.489 --> 31:01.490
And what are
you doing with it?

31:01.574 --> 31:05.911
He wasn't getting out as much
as he had so he thought I'd
have more use for it.

31:05.995 --> 31:09.038
Keep it in the family, eh?

31:09.122 --> 31:12.459
Is there anyone round
here who doesn't know
that you're my father?

31:17.254 --> 31:19.964
Let's just get on
with this, shall we?

31:20.757 --> 31:21.883
Okay.

31:23.342 --> 31:26.344
-Has Stuart been around?
-No. Why?

31:26.428 --> 31:30.348
Because that shyster has
offered me a fraction of what
those cottages are worth.

31:30.432 --> 31:32.933
-Well, he is a businessman.
-Oh, is that what you call it?

31:33.017 --> 31:35.227
Not that you would know.

31:35.311 --> 31:37.021
I'm sorry?

31:37.104 --> 31:40.356
Face it. If you'd
been a bit more capable
in that direction,

31:40.440 --> 31:42.942
we wouldn't have you-know-who
poking her nose in everywhere.

31:43.026 --> 31:47.613
And speaking of Stella, you've
not been entirely up front
with her yourself, have you?

31:47.696 --> 31:50.740
Morning, Archie.

31:50.823 --> 31:53.868
If you tell me what you
want us to take first,
I'll get my boys started.

31:53.951 --> 31:56.453
-Too late to
change my mind, then?
-It'd be a bit awkward.

31:56.536 --> 31:58.288
Well,
good, because I just have.

31:58.372 --> 32:00.791
-But we had a deal.
-So sue me.

32:07.879 --> 32:11.341
GOLLY: You're a natural.
JESSICA: I love the water.

32:11.424 --> 32:15.386
JESSICA:
Being in it, being on it,
just being next to it.

32:16.220 --> 32:17.971
GOLLY: Yeah, me, too.

32:22.016 --> 32:24.018
Were you happy?

32:24.102 --> 32:25.435
What?

32:25.519 --> 32:26.853
You and Mum.

32:27.646 --> 32:30.899
Yes. Well, for a while.

32:30.982 --> 32:34.402
-Until I came
along and spoiled it?
-Don't say that.

32:34.485 --> 32:38.822
-It's what happened, isn't it?
-As far as I was concerned,
you made it better.

32:40.907 --> 32:43.243
Anyway, look, are you hungry?

32:43.326 --> 32:45.202
Oh, starving.

32:46.036 --> 32:48.539
Venison or corned beef?

32:49.289 --> 32:52.166
I'm a vegetarian.

32:52.250 --> 32:56.962
Well, these cheese
ones will be yours.

32:57.045 --> 32:58.672
Comedian, eh?

32:58.755 --> 33:00.757
Takes one to know one.

33:03.175 --> 33:06.846
I mean, some of they cottages
are just ruins. They're just
gonna lie there and rot.

33:06.929 --> 33:09.097
-His loss.
-Well,
that's Archie's trouble.

33:09.180 --> 33:11.808
He wouldn't know a good deal
if it jumped up and
bit him on the nose.

33:11.891 --> 33:16.520
Just remember,
it's thanks to his tenacity
that we're still all here.

33:16.603 --> 33:18.731
Not that I'd expect
a McIntosh to understand.

33:18.814 --> 33:21.983
Okay, but cash money
for a pile of old rubble?

33:22.066 --> 33:24.694
I mean, you'd think
he'd jump at the chance.

33:24.777 --> 33:26.111
Cash money?

33:26.194 --> 33:29.656
Yep. And plenty of it.

33:31.615 --> 33:34.410
Tell me more.

33:34.493 --> 33:37.746
You must be pretty fit to
handle a boat that well.

33:37.829 --> 33:40.790
Must be all that sport
you played at university.

33:40.874 --> 33:42.834
Your grandfather and me were
the proudest men in the

33:42.917 --> 33:44.668
Highlands the day you got
your degree.

33:44.752 --> 33:48.255
-Really?
-Heard you were
a bit of a footballer.

33:48.338 --> 33:50.173
Or have you given that up?

33:50.256 --> 33:53.468
Eh, a pub near us
has got a women's team.

33:53.551 --> 33:56.511
-And you play in it?
-I have the odd kick-around.

33:56.595 --> 33:59.181
Well, maybe I'll get
to watch you one day.

33:59.264 --> 34:01.016
Oh, we only play locally.

34:01.099 --> 34:03.059
Durham isn't all that far.

34:03.142 --> 34:05.227
You just give me
a time and I'll be there.

34:05.311 --> 34:06.979
-What?
-Yeah.

34:07.063 --> 34:10.523
Cheer you on, take you
out for a drink after.

34:10.607 --> 34:13.193
And maybe I can introduce
you to all my friends.

34:13.275 --> 34:15.694
-I'd like that.
-Well, I wouldn't.

34:15.777 --> 34:18.989
In case you hadn't realised,
I've got
someone who plays dad.

34:19.072 --> 34:22.949
Murray might only be my
stepfather, but he's always
been there for me.

34:23.034 --> 34:25.869
He was the one who
took me on holidays,
helped me with my homework.

34:25.952 --> 34:29.164
Taught me to drive.
You can't just step
back in and take his place.

34:29.246 --> 34:30.456
That's not what I
meant at all.

34:30.540 --> 34:32.625
Good, 'cause you're 20 years
too late.

34:32.708 --> 34:35.252
I am not gonna apologise
for wanting to
see more of you.

34:35.335 --> 34:39.797
-I am your father.
-No. No, you're not.
You're a stranger.

34:39.880 --> 34:44.134
I bet, if the truth's told,
you aren't even sure
when my birthday is.

34:48.263 --> 34:50.598
I knew this was a mistake.

34:56.228 --> 35:00.232
So, for a whole cottage,
we're talking...

35:00.315 --> 35:03.234
Well, let's assume
cut stone, flags,

35:03.317 --> 35:07.821
lintels, lead, timbers.
Maybe a couple of
nice fireplaces.

-Five hundred pounds?
-Done.

-Your birthday, July the 24th.

35:41.850 --> 35:44.852
I got that for you on
your first birthday.

35:44.935 --> 35:47.354
Don't tell me,
you just forgot to send it?

35:47.438 --> 35:49.731
It was sent back.

35:49.813 --> 35:52.025
Christmas the same year,
same thing.

35:52.108 --> 35:54.777
I got this for you
when you were two.

35:54.861 --> 35:57.279
And this, that Christmas,

35:57.362 --> 36:00.574
although I admit I did not
send that because by that
time it was too late.

36:00.657 --> 36:02.074
I'd lost you.

36:02.158 --> 36:05.411
Oh, come on, you didn't
even know where we were.

36:05.493 --> 36:07.619
I kept in touch
with your mother.

36:07.704 --> 36:10.040
I knew I had
obligations and I met them,

36:10.123 --> 36:13.084
just to make sure you
had what you needed.

36:13.168 --> 36:16.211
-Money, you mean?
-Yes, lass, money.

Never a fortune mind,
not on the wages
of a farm labourer,

usually go to eat?

39:44.259 --> 39:45.552
Morning.

39:46.887 --> 39:48.722
(CLEARING THROAT)

39:54.644 --> 39:55.894
Hi.

39:58.146 --> 40:01.607
Eh, look, I won't
keep you long. I just...

40:01.691 --> 40:05.027
I just wanted to say
something before you go.

40:05.111 --> 40:07.696
Fine, but me first.

40:09.572 --> 40:11.574
And I don't mean
to sound heartless,

40:11.658 --> 40:15.244
but I think we should pretend
that the last couple
of days never happened.

40:17.162 --> 40:19.747
Okay. Fine.

40:21.666 --> 40:25.919
You were right, of course.
You've got a family...

40:26.003 --> 40:29.423
and you don't need me
making things
difficult for you.

40:32.049 --> 40:37.304
I spoke out of turn yesterday
and if I...
If I upset you, I'm sorry.

40:37.387 --> 40:41.099
That was, er,
that was the last
thing I meant to do.

40:43.600 --> 40:46.061
There's been enough hurt.

40:50.440 --> 40:52.442
Well, that's... That's it.

40:54.402 --> 40:58.113
Anyway, you, er, you
take care of yourself, lass.

41:02.074 --> 41:03.618
Goodbye.

41:30.098 --> 41:32.266
-Did you see that?
-What?

41:32.350 --> 41:34.352
That bush, it moved.

41:37.312 --> 41:39.356
It'll be the breeze.

42:07.796 --> 42:09.839
STELLA: I had a quick
look round the other day.

42:09.923 --> 42:13.509
It's not in too bad a
condition so it won't
take much doing up.

42:13.592 --> 42:16.971
I think a couple of months
and we could be letting.

42:24.727 --> 42:26.853
I don't believe it, it's gone.

42:26.937 --> 42:30.649
-Must have been that breeze.
-No,
Archie, I'm being serious.

42:30.732 --> 42:32.441
Are you sure
this is right place?

42:32.525 --> 42:36.320
Yes. Well, no. I mean,
it... It can't be, can it?

42:36.404 --> 42:38.571
Whole cottages
don't just vanish.

42:41.658 --> 42:44.618
No, not without help.

42:44.702 --> 42:47.830
Right. Now, how does
the official
greeting go again?

42:47.913 --> 42:49.455
-It's like this.
-Yeah.

42:49.539 --> 42:50.832
That's it. Ah!

42:50.915 --> 42:53.710
Oh. Welcome.

42:58.297 --> 42:59.965
Welcome, Brother.

43:02.091 --> 43:03.884
I think it's
time to get dressed.

43:03.968 --> 43:06.554
Is it really necessary to
do all this dressing up?

43:06.637 --> 43:09.097
It's not just napkins in laps
and noses in troughs,
you know.

43:09.180 --> 43:10.515
There's ceremony involved.

43:10.599 --> 43:13.058
Of course, ceremony.
How many more to come?

43:13.142 --> 43:15.436
-Well,
just one by my reckoning.
-Ah.

43:15.519 --> 43:18.147
(THUDDING AND SHOUTING)

43:18.230 --> 43:19.480
Oh, dear.

43:19.564 --> 43:21.190
Oh, dear.

43:23.568 --> 43:25.777
Thunderbirds are go!

43:26.153 --> 43:27.404
Right.

43:28.238 --> 43:29.698
Pat him down, Duncan.

43:29.781 --> 43:32.825
And you,
hands above your head.

43:32.908 --> 43:35.161
Spread 'em. Please.

43:35.244 --> 43:39.331
-All right,
we'll take over from here.
-Watch out, he's a tricky one.

43:39.414 --> 43:41.458
Keep him covered, shall I,
till the rozzers arrive?

43:41.541 --> 43:44.084
No, I don't think
there's any real need
to bother the boys in blue.

43:44.168 --> 43:46.295
But he's an intruder.

43:46.378 --> 43:50.590
Waltzed in, bold as you like,
and I was just settling
down to watch Ironside.

43:50.673 --> 43:53.426
Oh, look, I think
justice could be best served

43:53.509 --> 43:59.431
if we were to take him down to
the cellar and give him
the old Kilwillie caution.

43:59.514 --> 44:01.307
What do you say, Hector?

44:01.390 --> 44:03.184
(OUT OF BREATH) Absolutely.

44:03.267 --> 44:06.520
And it won't be a pretty sight
so I'm gonna have
to ask you both to...

44:06.604 --> 44:08.188
Understood.

44:09.314 --> 44:11.733
Come on, Duncan.

44:11.816 --> 44:14.318
There are times when
it's best we don't know.

44:15.861 --> 44:19.030
Thank you,
thank you, both of you.

44:20.573 --> 44:23.159
I'm so sorry, your Grace.

44:37.671 --> 44:40.006
Come on, then, let's go.

44:40.507 --> 44:41.675
Okay.

45:21.958 --> 45:24.252
(CHUCKLING)

45:24.335 --> 45:27.129
I think I prefer what you
were wearing last night.

45:27.212 --> 45:29.506
-Well, back to reality, eh?
-Ah, come here.

45:29.590 --> 45:32.592
-You look good
to me in anything.
-Thank you.

45:32.675 --> 45:35.595
So,
when were you gonna come back
and take the rest?

45:35.678 --> 45:37.470
What's going on?

45:37.554 --> 45:42.142
As far as I know,
cottages don't just disappear,
but four of ours have.

45:42.225 --> 45:45.060
Well, they were unsafe.
Should have been
pulled down years ago.

45:45.144 --> 45:46.812
So you don't deny
you've taken them?

45:46.896 --> 45:49.772
-Well, why should I?
-Because it's theft.

45:49.856 --> 45:52.358
Not when you've got a receipt.

45:53.693 --> 45:57.779
-Well, that's not from me.
-Did I say it was?

45:57.863 --> 46:02.325
If you're looking for someone
to blame, maybe you should
look closer to home.

46:04.744 --> 46:06.661
Well, this is it, Kilwillie.

46:06.745 --> 46:08.330
Certainly is. Your blindfold.

46:08.413 --> 46:11.374
-Not too tight, old man.
-Stay right where you are.

46:13.125 --> 46:15.753
-What on earth
have you two come as?
-Fancy dress.

46:15.836 --> 46:17.671
I told you there was
something funny going on.

46:17.755 --> 46:19.339
What an absurd suggestion.

46:19.422 --> 46:21.341
The money, where is it?

46:21.424 --> 46:24.385
Say nothing.
Careless talk costs lives.

46:24.469 --> 46:26.428
Fear not, Kilwillie.

46:26.511 --> 46:30.723
Well, there's only one thing
for it, then. We'll have to
take away your toys.

46:32.975 --> 46:34.810
Duncan, train set.

46:34.894 --> 46:36.686
And it'll be mine for keeps?

46:36.770 --> 46:39.564
If we don't get
what we want, yes.
Stella, fishing rods.

46:39.648 --> 46:41.107
You wouldn't dare.

46:41.191 --> 46:43.567
It might be just the thing
to jog the old memory, eh?

46:43.651 --> 46:46.987
I shouldn't leave it too long
or I might just
forget where I put them.

46:47.071 --> 46:49.989
Do you know what
happened to the last woman
who tried to threaten me?

46:50.073 --> 46:54.576
Do you know what
happened to the last man
who tried to stand in my way?

46:56.161 --> 46:59.498
-All right, all right.
-Duncan, wait.

46:59.581 --> 47:01.332
Can I just keep an engine?

47:01.415 --> 47:04.293
-I had
the money but it's gone.
-It was only Â£2,000.

47:04.377 --> 47:05.586
So what have you done with it?

47:05.670 --> 47:07.420
I joined the Highland Hundred.

47:08.838 --> 47:10.840
The what?

47:10.924 --> 47:13.926
The Highland Hundred.
It's supposed to be
some sort of secret club.

47:14.009 --> 47:15.928
What, do you mean
you've heard of us?

47:16.011 --> 47:17.596
-Hasn't everybody?
-I hadn't.

47:17.680 --> 47:19.973
Well, I suggest
you ask for a refund.

47:20.056 --> 47:24.060
That's completely out of the
question. We haven't refunded
a penny in our entire history.

47:24.143 --> 47:27.354
Lord Kilwillie,
I intend to recoup
those funds from somewhere.

47:27.437 --> 47:28.981
I only wish I could help.

47:29.064 --> 47:32.275
Howard McRaith, wasn't
he one of your members?

47:32.358 --> 47:33.985
-Oh, yeah.
-KILWILLIE: No!

47:34.068 --> 47:37.195
You might very well think so,
we couldn't possibly comment.

47:37.279 --> 47:40.824
Which might explain the,
er, people at his funeral.

47:40.907 --> 47:42.825
Like the sheriff.

47:42.908 --> 47:45.327
Well, I...
I don't see what that's
got to do with anything.

47:45.411 --> 47:48.496
Well, I was just thinking,
I could tip off
the Press and Journal,

47:48.580 --> 47:50.999
give them a few names
they might be
interested in printing.

47:51.082 --> 47:53.418
Oh, yes. Could even pay.

47:53.501 --> 47:55.544
They'd want to know
who I'd heard it from,
of course.

47:55.627 --> 47:59.631
But then... Then I
could never hold up my head
in polite society again.

47:59.715 --> 48:01.382
STELLA: Exactly.

48:18.105 --> 48:20.607
Is it too late
to say I'm sorry?

48:23.151 --> 48:26.361
Well, you've
nothing to be sorry for.

48:28.655 --> 48:30.115
Yes, I have.

48:33.284 --> 48:36.620
I've been thinking.

48:36.703 --> 48:39.956
There's no reason why
I can't have two dads,
is there?

48:41.750 --> 48:44.335
Well, not that I know of.

48:44.418 --> 48:46.420
What changed your mind?

48:48.630 --> 48:51.674
I think it was finding out
what great taste
you had in presents.

48:53.593 --> 48:56.678
Ah, well, you should have seen
what I got you
the year before.

48:58.347 --> 48:59.890
That'd be nice.

49:01.307 --> 49:03.935
Of course,
you'd have to invite me back.

49:05.895 --> 49:08.021
Only if you really mean it.

49:09.522 --> 49:10.732
I do.

49:12.524 --> 49:13.901
I promise.

49:21.115 --> 49:23.034
Any time you like, lass.

49:24.743 --> 49:26.245
Any time you like.

49:35.127 --> 49:37.587
So, all's well that
ends well, eh, Kilwillie?

49:37.671 --> 49:43.050
Well, it hasn't
ended very well for me,
or my bank balance.

49:43.133 --> 49:46.971
Ah, a good feed in
convivial company.
That'll take your mind off it.

49:47.054 --> 49:49.722
-Oh, I suppose you're right.
-Of course I am.

49:49.806 --> 49:51.099
Come on, then.

49:51.182 --> 49:52.850
-Ah, you've got me?
-Yeah.

49:52.934 --> 49:54.977
Thanks, old man.

49:57.855 --> 50:00.107
Now, behold the bun fight.

50:00.190 --> 50:02.441
Oh, splendid.
Can I take this off now?

50:02.525 --> 50:05.528
No. No, I wouldn't.

50:05.611 --> 50:08.280
-Not just yet, old man.
-Oh, right.

50:08.363 --> 50:12.616
Well, hello, chaps.
Er, I mean, Brothers.

50:16.829 --> 50:18.955
It's lovely to be here.

50:19.038 --> 50:23.835
I suppose this, er, this
is all part of the ceremony,
you all be quiet?

50:23.918 --> 50:27.504
Well,
that's splendid only, er,
don't start without me.
