00:06.623 --> 00:10.354
Attention all units,
attack in progress at 742 Summit Drive.

00:10.527 --> 00:15.157
742 Summit Drive. Screaming heard from
inside the residence. Respond, code three.

00:15.799 --> 00:18.165
Five-four-three-zero, show us responding.

00:18.334 --> 00:20.029
We'll be on scene in under a minute.

00:20.203 --> 00:22.501
Additional person reporting sound
of animal abuse.

00:22.672 --> 00:24.435
Hit it, man. Let's go.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

00:33.750 --> 00:36.651
-What the hell is that?
-Five-four-three-oh, request backup.

00:36.820 --> 00:38.617
-It's here.
-Yep.

00:42.659 --> 00:45.822
Stop.
Put your hands up and move away.

00:45.995 --> 00:47.326
I said, move away.

00:47.497 --> 00:48.725
I said, move away.

00:49.699 --> 00:52.497
-Miss, it's okay.
-What the fuck?

00:52.669 --> 00:54.136
I'm coming. I'm coming.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.864
What are you doing, man?
What's going on?

00:57.040 --> 00:59.474
I didn't do anything.
What are you talking about?

00:59.642 --> 01:01.371
Get your hands behind your back.

01:01.544 --> 01:03.341
I am deaf. Can you hear me?

01:03.513 --> 01:04.912
-Hey, partner.
-What?

01:05.081 --> 01:07.072
-You gotta look at this.
-I am deaf.

01:07.851 --> 01:09.580
-Fuck.
-We don't have a crime here.

01:09.753 --> 01:13.917
He wasn't raping me, he was fucking me.
You know, fucking.

01:14.390 --> 01:15.687
Goddamn.

01:15.859 --> 01:16.985
I was about to come.

01:50.593 --> 01:52.618
You ever fuck a deaf chick?

01:53.696 --> 01:55.129
Of course not.

01:55.298 --> 01:57.357
-Are you getting excited?
-Are you nervous?

01:57.534 --> 01:58.933
You only have nine days left.

01:59.102 --> 02:00.933
No, I'm not nervous, but....

02:01.104 --> 02:03.629
I tell you what,
this wedding planning stuff is unreal.

02:03.807 --> 02:05.798
I spent last night, all last night...

02:05.975 --> 02:09.411
...looking at books and magazines
of white flowers. Just white.

02:09.579 --> 02:10.603
I love big weddings.

02:10.780 --> 02:14.011
I don't know how people do it.
I'm just gonna elope.

02:14.184 --> 02:17.119
Yeah? I was unaware that gay marriages
were legal in this state.

02:17.287 --> 02:18.618
Yeah.

02:19.522 --> 02:20.546
What?

02:20.723 --> 02:23.283
Raise your hand
if you've ever fucked a deaf girl.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.526
Bullshit. You hooked up with a deaf girl?

02:27.697 --> 02:29.164
What, you're deaf now too?

02:29.332 --> 02:34.964
Yeah, Dan, I had sex with a deaf girl.

02:36.806 --> 02:39.070
Didn't you hook up with a mute girl
last semester?

02:39.242 --> 02:41.767
That makes you two-thirds of the way
to a Helen Keller.

02:41.945 --> 02:43.970
Dude, you have no idea.
She was crazy. She:
-

02:45.315 --> 02:46.304
Fucking....

02:46.482 --> 02:49.974
I almost shit myself when those cops
busted in. I thought she set me up.

02:50.153 --> 02:51.745
Mr. Max.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.947
-What is your take on this issue?
-I'm sorry, what issue is that?

02:55.124 --> 02:57.149
Are you not paying attention Mr. Max?

02:57.327 --> 03:01.423
No, I wasn't. I apologize. I was busy talking
about having sex with a deaf girl.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.827
Charming.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.400
And oddly appropriate.

03:06.569 --> 03:10.005
Do you or do you not feel that little people
should be a protected class?

03:10.173 --> 03:11.197
You mean midgets?

03:11.374 --> 03:14.275
No, Mr. Max, I do not mean midgets.
I mean little people.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.777
"Midget" is an antiquated
and pejorative term.

03:17.947 --> 03:20.882
What are we protecting them from,
eagles and poachers and stuff?

03:21.050 --> 03:22.312
Like an endangered species?

03:22.485 --> 03:25.511
-Really? Poachers?
-Mr. Max, if you didn't do the reading--

03:25.688 --> 03:29.454
Well, sir, dwarfism is already
a protected class under the ADA.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.287
So your point is kind of moot.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.725
Now, if you're asking me if I agree,
I'm not sure.

03:33.897 --> 03:35.990
There are so many kinds of little people.

03:36.165 --> 03:40.192
There are the ones who are just shorter and
might need a booster seat at their cubicle.

03:40.370 --> 03:44.204
There are those dwarves with giant heads
and flipper arms who can barely walk.

03:44.374 --> 03:48.105
Now, is there a reasonable accommodation
an employer can make for those types...

03:48.278 --> 03:51.338
...that doesn't qualify him
for the business necessity exception?

03:51.514 --> 03:55.075
-I don't think so.
-Then where do you draw the line?

03:55.485 --> 03:57.476
I figure it's like riding a roller coaster.

03:57.921 --> 04:00.481
You must be this high
to get ADA protection.

04:01.858 --> 04:03.553
Very funny, Mr. Max.

04:03.726 --> 04:06.695
What if I told you I just finished
a pro bono case...

04:06.863 --> 04:09.730
...that involved a gentlemen's club
that tried to terminate...

04:09.899 --> 04:12.527
...the employment of a dancer
with dwarfism because she--

04:12.702 --> 04:14.431
You represented a midget stripper?

04:15.872 --> 04:18.670
-Was she hot?
-Mr. Max.

04:19.509 --> 04:24.242
If you're genuinely interested in the case,
come to office hours and I'll fill you in.

04:24.414 --> 04:28.043
In the meantime, let's remember
that this is an employment law class...

04:28.217 --> 04:29.912
...not Adult Friend Finder.

04:31.254 --> 04:33.347
Touché. I will shut up now.

04:35.358 --> 04:39.124
Dude, so you ready
for your bachelor party tonight or what?

04:39.295 --> 04:40.523
Locked and loaded.

04:40.697 --> 04:44.827
Good. I'm gonna go get Drew.
Meet us at the campus bar after class.

04:45.535 --> 04:49.869
Oh, I guess I'll just finish up here for you.
Jackass.

04:53.743 --> 04:57.679
Energy sword.
Who uses a fucking energy sword?

05:07.123 --> 05:10.957
Pick up that energy sword one more time,
I am going to rape with you with it.

05:16.199 --> 05:18.394
-Hello.
-Yo, Drew, it's Tucker.

05:18.568 --> 05:19.592
What are you doing?

05:19.769 --> 05:21.896
Punishing unethical behavior.

05:22.071 --> 05:24.699
All right. Well, I'm coming to get you, man.
We're going drinking.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.168
Here comes your object lesson.

05:28.778 --> 05:30.769
Gained the lead.

05:38.488 --> 05:40.285
Fucker.

05:58.141 --> 06:00.268
Are those tampons?

06:00.810 --> 06:01.834
Fuck.

06:02.011 --> 06:05.503
"Take whatever you want.
Her box is apparently open to all."

06:06.416 --> 06:07.440
Jesus.

06:11.421 --> 06:15.881
Wow, look at this place.
It's a shrine to cuckoldry and rage.

06:20.263 --> 06:21.287
You ready, dude?

06:23.766 --> 06:25.563
What are you talking about?

06:26.769 --> 06:30.364
-We're going to the bar. I told you.
-I don't actually listen to what you say.

06:30.540 --> 06:34.567
I just wait for you to stop talking
about yourself, get bored and hang up.

06:38.848 --> 06:40.611
Did Sarah call yet?

06:40.783 --> 06:44.412
No. She probably has trouble
talking with a dick in her mouth.

06:44.587 --> 06:46.316
Fuck, man.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.013
This cartoon is disturbingly hot.

06:48.191 --> 06:50.386
Can you imagine a threesome
with these two?

06:50.560 --> 06:52.994
I can imagine them both cheating on me.

06:53.162 --> 06:57.326
-They're cartoons, dude.
-Oh, I'm on to your game, De Nils.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.300
Diamonds are worthless,
other than the value attached to them...

07:01.471 --> 07:04.929
...by the tramps you've brainwashed
into thinking diamond equals love.

07:05.108 --> 07:06.405
Guess what, sluts.

07:06.576 --> 07:10.410
Your quest for the perfect princess cut
supports terrorism and genocide.

07:10.580 --> 07:14.880
Congratulations, your avarice
has managed to destroy an entire continent.

07:18.788 --> 07:20.016
Sarah kept the ring?

07:20.923 --> 07:22.948
I hope you die in a fire.

07:23.126 --> 07:25.890
You act like you're the first person
to ever get cheated on.

07:26.062 --> 07:27.996
It happens to everybody, even me.

07:28.164 --> 07:33.659
Oh, yeah? Does everyone walk in
on their fiancée sucking off a rapper?

07:33.836 --> 07:35.701
Honey, your throat feeling any--?

07:35.872 --> 07:37.032
-How they do.
-Ah!

07:37.206 --> 07:39.697
Yeah, buddy. Grillionaire in the house.

07:40.176 --> 07:43.270
Hey, who knew blowjobs were good
for sore throats, right?

07:44.547 --> 07:48.142
The most rewarding part
of our friendship...

07:48.317 --> 07:51.411
...is your ability to find amusement
in the destruction of my life.

07:51.587 --> 07:53.919
It's not that bad, dude.

07:54.090 --> 07:55.921
You always get stuck in these cycles.

07:56.092 --> 07:58.253
When you get depressed like this...

07:58.427 --> 08:01.885
...you need to ask yourself,
"What would Tucker do?”

08:02.064 --> 08:04.589
And then you go out and you do that.

08:04.767 --> 08:06.564
I already know what you would do.

08:06.736 --> 08:11.173
And I have no desire to get HIV
from one of the cum dumpsters...

08:11.340 --> 08:14.002
...into whom you shoot your emotional pain
every weekend.

08:14.177 --> 08:15.701
HIV is basically curable now.

08:15.878 --> 08:18.938
It doesn't even show up
in Magic Johnson's blood anymore.

08:19.582 --> 08:25.020
Are you saying that Magic Johnson
is black and has AIDS...

08:25.188 --> 08:27.088
...and has it better than me?

08:30.326 --> 08:32.385
Yeah, I love children.
You know, I wanna--

08:32.562 --> 08:35.759
Yeah, when I graduate I wanna work
with them, have a bunch of my own.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.331
-Really?
-Yeah, what about you?

08:37.500 --> 08:38.967
Are you kidding me? I love kids.

08:39.135 --> 08:42.035
-I can't wait to have more.
-Shut up, you don't have kids.

08:42.205 --> 08:43.399
-Yep. I do.
-No, you don't.

08:43.573 --> 08:47.805
He does. They're just all in the compost
heap behind Planned Parenthood.

08:48.844 --> 08:51.369
If you do stem-cell research,
you can work with them.

08:52.748 --> 08:55.182
All right, this is my boy.
Run along, baby, man talk.

08:55.351 --> 08:57.751
-All right.
-I got your number, I'll call you.

08:57.920 --> 08:58.944
Perhaps.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.884
Who says romance is dead?

09:01.057 --> 09:02.319
How can you hate women...

09:02.491 --> 09:04.891
...yet at the same time
be mad at what Tucker does?

09:05.061 --> 09:07.723
-It makes no sense.
-I am like a feminist.

09:07.897 --> 09:11.094
I can assert
multiple contradictory positions.

09:11.267 --> 09:13.792
Do me a favor.
Can you not talk to my server like that?

09:14.370 --> 09:15.997
It's disrespectful, okay?

09:17.440 --> 09:19.533
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, I think you heard me.

09:19.709 --> 09:23.304
Oh, I heard you, hero.
You don't want me flirting with your server.

09:23.479 --> 09:26.539
-I didn't know she belonged to you.
-It's a figure of speech.

09:26.716 --> 09:29.981
Here's another figure of speech:
mind your own fucking business.

09:30.386 --> 09:33.184
I'm sorry I've accomplished more
with Leslie in 30 minutes...

09:33.356 --> 09:36.655
...than you have in two years,
but she looked happy talking to me.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.158
Or maybe she rubs her crotch
against all customers.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.319
-Probably.
-It's time for you to leave.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.989
-It's time for you to get us another drink.
-Yeah, I don't think so, man.

09:45.167 --> 09:48.603
Could you just go ahead
and put this on my tab, please? Thank you.

09:48.771 --> 09:50.705
Can you get me another beer for--?

09:50.873 --> 09:53.774
-Actually, another two beers for table six.
-Last one.

09:53.943 --> 09:56.343
All right.
Three beers for table six. Thanks.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.309
What the eff, Leslie?

09:59.181 --> 10:01.081
Okay, come on, fuck stick. Let's do this.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.275
You're gonna fuck this girl, pal.

10:06.555 --> 10:08.022
You think you're tough?

10:08.190 --> 10:09.282
No.

10:09.458 --> 10:10.789
Just tougher than you.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.757
Tell your friend I know Brazilian jiujutsu.

10:13.929 --> 10:15.294
He wants to make out.

10:20.770 --> 10:22.704
Why is he twitching?

10:22.872 --> 10:25.636
Listen, we need to discuss
a change of venue for your party.

10:25.808 --> 10:26.832
This should be good.

10:27.009 --> 10:29.773
No, seriously, the strip club
we're supposed to go to sucks.

10:29.945 --> 10:31.207
It's dirty and decrepit...

10:31.380 --> 10:34.611
...and the girls have personalities
like the worst parts of the Bible.

10:34.784 --> 10:37.878
Personalities?
Are you saying we have to talk to them?

10:38.054 --> 10:40.522
Some of us actually enjoy
the company of women, Drew.

10:40.690 --> 10:44.626
Oh, yeah, I'm the misogynist here. Okay.

10:44.794 --> 10:48.286
Wouldn't be an issue if Richmond hadn't
passed the no-touching-strippers ordinance.

10:48.464 --> 10:51.661
Wait a second. You wanna touch
them now? You said they're disgusting.

10:51.834 --> 10:54.166
Well, what do you wanna do, Dan?
Play checkers?

10:54.337 --> 10:56.168
This is a fucking bachelor party.

10:56.339 --> 10:57.806
What did you have in mind?

10:57.973 --> 10:59.634
All right. Thank you very much.

10:59.809 --> 11:03.905
A short three-and-a-half hour drive away
is a strip club called Avarice.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.310
You know what,
I'm sorry, let me back that up.

11:06.482 --> 11:08.006
This isn't just some strip club.

11:08.184 --> 11:10.152
This is the Super Bowl
of carnal pleasures.

11:10.319 --> 11:12.048
We've been to strip clubs before.

11:12.221 --> 11:15.088
Not like this one, dude.
First time I got a lap dance there...

11:15.257 --> 11:17.885
...the stripper grabs my hands
and puts them on her tits.

11:18.060 --> 11:21.257
Second dance, she turns around
and dry humps me the entire time.

11:21.430 --> 11:24.490
She was gorgeous and she wasn't close
to being the best one there.

11:24.667 --> 11:27.727
I used to think there was a line
between a gentlemen's club and a brothel.

11:27.903 --> 11:30.929
-Now you're telling me it's all just gray.
-Wait a second.

11:31.107 --> 11:34.599
You can full on grab their tits
and they don't even care?

11:34.777 --> 11:37.439
-They encourage it.
-Bet they had good childhoods.

11:37.880 --> 11:43.819
The very best part,
$10 dances all night long.

11:43.986 --> 11:49.720
I would rather fellate a hot curling iron
than drive 250 miles...

11:49.892 --> 11:52.520
...because Tucker breastfed till he was 9.

11:52.695 --> 11:54.959
Look, sounds great, but I can't leave,
all right?

11:55.131 --> 11:57.258
I got all kinds of meetings
and stuff tomorrow.

11:57.433 --> 11:58.798
What kind of meetings?

11:58.968 --> 12:02.927
You know, important stuff,
like the seating chart and whatnot.

12:03.105 --> 12:05.005
A seating chart?

12:05.174 --> 12:08.974
I'm pretty sure
Kristy can cut that Gordian knot.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.511
Look, the wedding is next weekend,
all right?

12:11.680 --> 12:14.877
I'm not gonna leave Kristy hanging
because of some no-touch policy.

12:15.050 --> 12:16.711
That's your issue, Tucker, not mine.

12:16.886 --> 12:18.513
We'll be back tomorrow afternoon.

12:18.687 --> 12:20.348
If we stay in Richmond...

12:20.890 --> 12:23.654
...we're not gonna have the experience
we need to make up...

12:23.826 --> 12:28.354
...for that abomination of an engagement
party you had with Kristy's family.

12:29.231 --> 12:34.066
So the tension builds.
G, 61.

12:34.236 --> 12:35.533
Any bingos?

12:35.704 --> 12:37.399
G, 61.

12:37.573 --> 12:40.098
Genesis chapter six, verse one.

12:40.709 --> 12:43.075
-Yeah, that was pretty bad.
-This is it.

12:45.047 --> 12:51.247
This is our last fucking gasp together
as single men.

12:51.987 --> 12:53.545
I guess.

12:53.722 --> 12:55.417
Dude, you're my boys.

12:55.591 --> 12:58.788
I'm just gonna be honest with you,
if you keep acting like a bitch...

12:58.961 --> 13:01.225
...somebody's gonna fuck
that pussy in your face.

13:01.397 --> 13:04.025
He's right. Someone will do that.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.258
What about Drew?

13:05.434 --> 13:07.061
Oh, don't drag me into this.

13:07.236 --> 13:09.500
There is a Next Generation marathon
this weekend.

13:09.672 --> 13:12.004
I'm more than happy
just lusting after Deanna Troi.

13:12.174 --> 13:14.972
He hasn't been out of his nerd hole
for two weeks.

13:15.144 --> 13:17.840
-Drew needs this.
-You do need this.

13:18.013 --> 13:19.776
I need this like I need hepatitis C.

13:19.949 --> 13:21.211
You need this.

13:22.184 --> 13:23.412
You need this.

13:23.586 --> 13:25.816
He needs this. I need it.

13:25.988 --> 13:27.421
We all need it.

13:27.590 --> 13:29.558
Because it's our destiny as men.

13:30.092 --> 13:33.425
There is no way
I'm not gonna regret this.

13:33.596 --> 13:35.496
But fuck it. Let's go.

13:35.664 --> 13:36.995
Done. Fuck it.

13:39.268 --> 13:41.532
-Whatever.
-Let's get the fuck out of here.

13:41.704 --> 13:43.501
Why not?

13:45.608 --> 13:48.099
Bro, make sure to tell Leslie
that I'm an asshole...

13:48.277 --> 13:50.905
...and she should stay away,
it'll only help me.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.411
-Hey, see you.
-Hey.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.310
That's for you.

13:55.451 --> 13:57.419
I already fingered her.

14:05.160 --> 14:08.823
Remember, you're the reason we're going
on this trip and you fucking earned it.

14:08.998 --> 14:11.796
So put your goddamn game face on.

14:14.803 --> 14:17.294
-Let's do this.
-All right.

14:19.241 --> 14:23.075
He's gonna fail
worse than a Friends spinoff.

14:27.049 --> 14:28.880
-Hey, babe.
-Hey.

14:29.051 --> 14:30.313
What are you working on?

14:30.486 --> 14:31.851
The seating chart.

14:32.021 --> 14:33.215
Oh, yeah?

14:33.389 --> 14:35.516
Wow, looks like you're almost done.

14:35.691 --> 14:37.249
Not really.

14:37.426 --> 14:39.018
-Hey, guess who just called.
-Who?

14:39.194 --> 14:40.320
My mom.

14:40.496 --> 14:42.623
What?
Another dinosaur fossil test her faith?

14:44.166 --> 14:47.294
She's coming into town early to help out.
Isn't that nice of her?

14:47.469 --> 14:50.165
-How early?
-Tonight.

14:51.507 --> 14:52.804
Tonight?

14:52.975 --> 14:56.411
You know she's only coming in early
so she can take control of everything.

14:56.579 --> 14:59.139
No, she's not. Quit being so dramatic.

15:00.316 --> 15:03.547
If she has it her way, the reception's
gonna be a potluck in a barn.

15:03.719 --> 15:06.711
She's pious and conservative, Dan,
not Pennsylvania Dutch.

15:06.889 --> 15:09.881
Probably gonna churn our own butter
for the dinner rolls.

15:10.059 --> 15:13.551
My parents are paying for this entire
wedding. She's entitled to some input.

15:13.729 --> 15:15.060
Come on, babe.

15:15.230 --> 15:18.427
I just don't want her
to suck all of the fun out of the wedding.

15:18.601 --> 15:19.727
It's my day too.

15:19.902 --> 15:21.164
All right, Groomzilla.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.429
Oh, whoa.

15:22.605 --> 15:26.302
Don't Groomzilla me. Those squirrel hunters
wouldn't know a good time if it...

15:26.475 --> 15:28.909
...landed on the front lawn
of their megachurch.

15:31.547 --> 15:33.310
What's taking him so long?

15:33.482 --> 15:36.747
He's talking to a woman.
Anything is possible.

15:38.454 --> 15:39.648
What are you doing?

15:39.822 --> 15:40.880
Packing.

15:41.056 --> 15:42.080
For what?

15:42.257 --> 15:45.590
I'm going to Salem with Tucker and Drew
for my bachelor party.

15:45.761 --> 15:47.956
-I thought you were staying.
-Change of plans.

15:48.130 --> 15:50.598
Tucker knows about a great strip club
down there.

15:50.766 --> 15:53.030
Oh, good for Tucker.
I hope he has a great time.

15:53.202 --> 15:56.569
Babe, come on.
You know I can't let him go off by himself.

15:57.072 --> 16:00.235
-Somebody needs go have his back.
-Oh, and who's got your back?

16:00.409 --> 16:01.933
Drew?

16:03.278 --> 16:04.472
Tucker's got my back.

16:04.647 --> 16:07.081
Tucker? Tucker says he's got your back.

16:07.249 --> 16:10.013
Except you're the one who
always ends up bailing him out.

16:10.185 --> 16:13.052
I wish you took care of me
as well as you take care of Tucker.

16:13.389 --> 16:18.292
Well, that is a load of crap. I always look
out for you. You're my number-one priority.

16:19.361 --> 16:23.593
Really? Really?
When have I taken precedence?

16:23.766 --> 16:25.427
When have you chosen me over Tucker?

16:25.601 --> 16:27.660
Give me an example. Just one.

16:28.771 --> 16:30.068
I'm marrying you, aren't I?

16:31.273 --> 16:32.467
Should I go help?

16:32.641 --> 16:35.007
There is a zero-percent chance...

16:35.177 --> 16:39.113
...that injecting you into the situation
is gonna make it any better.

16:40.716 --> 16:42.308
I'm going in.

16:47.990 --> 16:49.355
Bring me a Red Bull.

16:49.525 --> 16:51.186
Yeah, why can't we just compromise?

16:51.360 --> 16:52.452
Compromise?

16:52.628 --> 16:54.528
You kidding? That's all I've been doing.

16:54.697 --> 16:58.064
Your father didn't want a party
with strippers and booze, I said fine.

16:58.233 --> 17:02.101
We'll have an engagement party at church.
I wanted a bouncy castle at the reception.

17:02.271 --> 17:05.205
“Bouncy castles are childish and dangerous.
Grow up."

17:05.741 --> 17:09.006
You know, and I said fine because
I didn't wanna argue with your mom.

17:09.178 --> 17:11.009
It's just a stupid bouncy castle.

17:11.180 --> 17:14.047
The only thing I've been able
to hold onto is the open bar...

17:14.215 --> 17:16.650
...and now she's gonna fly in here
and take that too.

17:16.819 --> 17:18.684
You're not gonna do a thing to stop her.

17:19.121 --> 17:23.114
You know, if all this is so important to you,
then quit complaining and take a stand.

17:24.326 --> 17:26.556
Oh, you want me to take a stand? Fine.

17:26.729 --> 17:28.924
I'm going to Salem
and I don't care what you...

17:29.098 --> 17:31.589
...or the Wicked Witch of West Texas
thinks about it.

17:31.767 --> 17:33.257
What's up, guys? You ready?

17:33.435 --> 17:36.165
Hey, what's this I hear you're
taking Dan out of town?

17:36.338 --> 17:38.499
Richmond passed
this stupid no-touch policy.

17:38.674 --> 17:41.302
Since the ladies
can't seem to keep their hands off me...

17:41.477 --> 17:43.570
...it'd be irresponsible
to go to clubs here.

17:43.746 --> 17:46.146
-How thoughtful of you.
-You don't mind, do you?

17:50.018 --> 17:51.645
I'm not stepping on any toes, am l?

17:51.820 --> 17:54.254
We have all the final wedding
appointments tomorrow.

17:54.423 --> 17:55.822
Oh, no.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.117
Dan.

17:57.292 --> 17:59.817
You didn't say anything.
Why didn't you tell me, man?

17:59.995 --> 18:03.362
That's not cool. It's your wedding, man.

18:03.532 --> 18:07.161
Listen, we'll just go out in town.
We can do Salem after your honeymoon.

18:08.070 --> 18:10.402
Sound good, huh?
Kristy, that way you can come too.

18:12.608 --> 18:14.769
-All right, that's cool.
-All right.

18:14.943 --> 18:16.433
He won't need this anymore.

18:16.612 --> 18:19.342
I'll have him back
before you even wake up.

18:19.748 --> 18:22.342
Kristy, you look hot as always.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.009
You are so full of shit.

18:30.025 --> 18:31.925
Salem, here we come, man.

18:32.094 --> 18:33.288
-Yeah.
-What?

18:33.462 --> 18:35.396
Oh, come on.

18:35.564 --> 18:38.328
Do you think it's possible
to keep me from something I want?

18:38.500 --> 18:40.024
The more important question is...

18:40.202 --> 18:43.660
...are you ready to get shitfaced
and grab some titties?

18:43.839 --> 18:45.272
That's not a Red Bull.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.101
Yeah.

19:13.635 --> 19:17.127
Here's what I don't get.
Why did you have to lie to her?

19:17.306 --> 19:18.773
It's not like I wasn't gonna go.

19:18.941 --> 19:22.342
Oh, please. When I walked in,
you had so much surrender in your eyes...

19:22.511 --> 19:24.741
...I thought your apartment
was Vichy France.

19:24.913 --> 19:28.246
We need to stop for food.
My blood sugar is getting low.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.385
I just hate lying to Kristy, man.

19:30.552 --> 19:32.747
You didn't lie to her, I did.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.081
That is bullshit.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.747
But somehow I'm going with it.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.689
If I don't get a pancakewich,
I'm calling the authorities...

19:39.862 --> 19:42.558
...and have you arrested
for kidnapping and conspiracy.

19:42.731 --> 19:45.529
I don't know how you eat pancakewiches.
They look disgusting.

19:46.835 --> 19:49.429
I can only assume
from your cavalier attitude...

19:49.605 --> 19:53.905
...that you have yet to partake
in the wonderment that is the pancakewich.

19:54.076 --> 19:55.202
Let me enlighten you.

19:56.078 --> 20:01.414
What happens is the one true god
grows pancakewiches on trees...

20:01.583 --> 20:05.212
...in the Elysian Fields
using a mystical incantation.

20:05.387 --> 20:09.084
He then proceeds to magic them down
to your local eatery...

20:09.258 --> 20:13.888
...where whatever societal reject
Griddleworld has rescued off the dole...

20:14.062 --> 20:17.122
...gently wraps them in cellophane
and passes them along to you...

20:17.299 --> 20:19.290
...the fortunate consumer.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.902
You proceed to ingest this finery...

20:22.070 --> 20:24.630
...in the vain hope
that your overmatched taste buds...

20:24.806 --> 20:30.142
...can somehow comprehend the delectable
intricacies that face them.

20:30.312 --> 20:33.372
Is that egg? Why, yes. Yes, it is.

20:33.548 --> 20:35.140
And bacon too.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.841
But wait, did they--?

20:37.019 --> 20:40.011
They didn't. Yes, they did,
they did indeed.

20:40.756 --> 20:42.189
They added cheese.

20:42.357 --> 20:45.087
And then, then, my friend...

20:45.260 --> 20:50.061
...they wrapped it
in a sumptuous pancake bun.

20:50.232 --> 20:56.432
As your taste buds try to process
that amazing piece of information...

20:56.605 --> 20:58.470
...it hits them.

20:59.441 --> 21:00.669
The syrup nugget.

21:01.243 --> 21:04.371
The motherfucking syrup nugget.

21:04.546 --> 21:08.107
It announces itself
with a burst of confectionery grandiosity...

21:08.283 --> 21:12.879
...the likes of which your palate
has never seen.

21:14.756 --> 21:17.384
So you like them?

21:19.027 --> 21:21.052
Allow me to rephrase.

21:21.229 --> 21:23.527
If you ever speak ill
of the pancakewich again...

21:23.699 --> 21:27.135
...I will personally come to your home
and force-feed you one...

21:27.302 --> 21:30.863
...while I fuck you in the ass
with the wrapper as a condom...

21:31.039 --> 21:35.669
...and then donkey punch you
when the infused syrup nugget explodes.

21:37.179 --> 21:40.546
We got a motherfucking Griddleworld
coming up at the next exit.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.445
Thank God.

22:10.278 --> 22:11.836
Oh, come on. Who farted?

22:12.014 --> 22:14.744
-I don't smell anything.
-Oh, my God.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.941
Oh, what is wrong with you?

22:17.119 --> 22:19.952
It smells like you got buttfucked
by a garbage truck.

22:20.122 --> 22:22.682
Hey, Griddleworld was your idea, man.

22:22.858 --> 22:24.917
Do not disparage the pancakewich.

22:25.093 --> 22:27.857
Could you just unlock
the fucking window, Tucker?

22:28.030 --> 22:29.930
-You get a bit back there?
-Fuck yourself.

22:30.699 --> 22:32.667
Where are my law books?

22:32.834 --> 22:34.734
This must count as a felony battery.

22:34.903 --> 22:37.098
-Dude.
-All right, fuck.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.137
You guys have such weak constitutions.

22:39.307 --> 22:41.832
I bet those girls
wouldn't complain as much as you two.

22:42.010 --> 22:44.103
-I can taste that.
-They wouldn't. They're hookers.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.746
They subject themselves
to anything...

22:45.914 --> 22:48.439
-...for the right price.
-Not every woman is a whore.

22:48.617 --> 22:51.051
Tucker, where are we going?
Where's the strip club?

22:51.219 --> 22:53.847
It's not even 7:00 yet.
The club doesn't open till 10.

22:54.322 --> 22:57.553
-Let's get some drinks first. Pre-game.
-Oh, wonderful.

22:57.726 --> 22:59.921
Now I can hate
all these people from up close...

23:00.095 --> 23:03.553
...instead of baselessly judging them
from this metal fart coffin.

23:04.066 --> 23:07.502
Last time I was here there was more pussy
than you could shake a stick at.

23:07.669 --> 23:10.968
Unbelievable hot chicks, wall to wall.

23:14.242 --> 23:15.800
All right, dude.

23:15.977 --> 23:18.571
Can’t you see...

23:18.747 --> 23:22.410
Oh, yeah, this place is crawling with trim.
Shame I'm taken.

23:22.584 --> 23:24.609
Let's see some IDs, guys.

23:24.786 --> 23:28.654
Looks like Lane Bryant and Jenny Craig
had a knife fight in here.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.689
Ten dollar cover tonight.

23:30.859 --> 23:33.828
You know what a soft-off is?

23:33.995 --> 23:35.019
No, what is it?

23:35.197 --> 23:37.097
It's the opposite of a hard-on.

23:37.699 --> 23:39.098
And that's what I have.

23:39.267 --> 23:40.928
I will pay you $10...

23:41.103 --> 23:44.732
...only if you can erase this visual atrocity
from my memory.

23:44.906 --> 23:47.773
Go down to Whiskey Bar.
That's where everybody's at tonight.

23:47.943 --> 23:50.070
And by everybody,
you mean all the dudes?

23:50.245 --> 23:52.543
I wish, man, I wish.
No, I gotta stay here.

23:53.014 --> 23:54.481
-Let's give it a shot.
-Come on.

23:54.649 --> 23:56.549
It can't be worse than this.

24:03.024 --> 24:06.187
All right, now this is what I call
a target-rich environment.

24:06.361 --> 24:07.623
I agree.

24:07.796 --> 24:10.629
I wanna shoot
every one of these bitches.

24:10.799 --> 24:12.266
-Not her.
-Nice.

24:12.434 --> 24:13.799
-Her too.
-All right, fellas.

24:13.969 --> 24:16.233
A little over two hours
until Avarice opens up.

24:16.404 --> 24:18.497
Let's see if we can't get
girls to go with us.

24:18.673 --> 24:19.833
Wait, wait, wait.

24:20.008 --> 24:25.708
You wanna pick up sluts
to bring them to go see whores?

24:25.881 --> 24:27.576
If things go well.

24:27.749 --> 24:30.946
Oh, look, a menagerie of sluts.
Who would have guessed?

24:31.119 --> 24:34.782
What are those drinks? Not the ones
with the penises in it. The other ones.

24:34.956 --> 24:36.480
It's called a Flaming Dr. Pepper.

24:36.658 --> 24:39.923
-Looks amazing. Throw three more on there.
-We're not paying for those.

24:40.095 --> 24:43.155
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
It's okay, we got this round.

24:43.698 --> 24:46.258
My name isn't sweetheart, it's Mary.

24:46.434 --> 24:48.925
Okay, good to know. Thank you.

24:49.104 --> 24:51.538
Drew, not all girls are sluts.

24:51.706 --> 24:54.504
-Just most of them.
-I hope this sets off the sprinklers.

24:54.676 --> 24:56.439
-Oh, nice.
-Shit.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.579
Oh!

25:01.750 --> 25:02.978
I've seen better.

25:08.123 --> 25:09.147
That tastes like ass.

25:09.324 --> 25:11.349
Holy shit. It tastes like a Dr. Pepper.

25:12.227 --> 25:13.285
Hence the name.

25:13.461 --> 25:15.326
Thank you. Again. Eight more of them.

25:15.497 --> 25:17.021
That will be another $120.

25:17.199 --> 25:20.430
Shit. Just get us eight vodka shots.
You guys aren't worth that much.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.797
Oh, our company is priceless.

25:22.971 --> 25:26.498
If it lacks a price,
it is probably worthless.

25:27.075 --> 25:29.635
-Any particular kind of vodka?
-Well, please.

25:29.811 --> 25:32.177
Thank you for asking. Down there.

25:36.184 --> 25:39.119
If this is a real bachelorette party,
who's the designated slut?

25:39.287 --> 25:41.551
Don't call us sluts.
You didn't even know us.

25:41.723 --> 25:42.951
No one here is a slut.

25:43.124 --> 25:44.148
Oh, come on, come on.

25:44.326 --> 25:47.784
The slut at a bachelor party
is kind of like the sucker at a poker table.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.090
If you can't pick them out,
it's probably you.

25:51.566 --> 25:54.330
Here we are ladies, one for each of you.
Palm greaser for you.

25:54.502 --> 25:56.732
-Panty dropper for you.
-Not cool, you know.

25:56.905 --> 26:00.170
Making fun of girls to impress your friends
is so immature.

26:00.342 --> 26:01.366
You're such a jerk.

26:01.543 --> 26:03.408
Your friends are laughing
more than mine.

26:03.578 --> 26:06.138
-I'm not laughing at all.
-Why are you guys laughing?

26:06.314 --> 26:08.680
Don't laugh. It's not funny.

26:09.417 --> 26:12.853
I think a toast is in order for my buddy Dan,
who's also getting married.

26:13.555 --> 26:17.457
And the bachelorette
and all her beautiful friends...

26:17.626 --> 26:19.389
...even the bitchy prude.

26:20.996 --> 26:24.022
Here is to the people we've met.

26:24.199 --> 26:25.826
And to the people we've fucked.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.401
And to those of us
who have had no such luck.

26:29.271 --> 26:34.208
Here's to beer in the glass
and vodka in the cup.

26:34.376 --> 26:38.745
Here's to poking her in the ass
so she won't get knocked up.

26:38.913 --> 26:42.110
Here's to all of you, and here's to me...

26:42.284 --> 26:44.878
...together as friends we will always be.

26:45.053 --> 26:46.714
But if we should ever disagree...

26:46.888 --> 26:48.879
...then fuck all of you, here's to me.

26:50.191 --> 26:52.819
-Cheers.
-All right.

26:54.329 --> 26:56.763
All right, but for real,
which one's the naughty one?

26:56.931 --> 26:59.525
See now, the world goes round in circles

26:59.701 --> 27:01.430
It never would stop

27:07.542 --> 27:10.409
All right. What's your porn name?

27:10.578 --> 27:11.806
Scott Peterson.

27:11.980 --> 27:14.107
No, no, not your real name.

27:14.282 --> 27:17.410
Your porn name is your pet's name
and the street you grew up on.

27:17.585 --> 27:19.576
I wasn't allowed to have pets.

27:19.754 --> 27:23.121
Okay, we'll do another way, then.
What's your middle name?

27:23.291 --> 27:27.751
I don't have one, unless I missed it
between "shut" and "up" as a kid.

27:27.929 --> 27:30.523
Oh, come on. Play along, it's fun.

27:30.699 --> 27:35.466
If you touch me again.
I will gut you and grind you into pig slop.

27:38.440 --> 27:39.873
What--? Why?

27:40.041 --> 27:43.602
You're the only guy I know
that actually cock blocks himself.

27:43.778 --> 27:47.874
Come on, man.
This night is about you and Dan.

27:48.049 --> 27:49.573
Remember what we talked about?

27:49.751 --> 27:51.480
Instead of being a fucking killjoy...

27:51.653 --> 27:54.087
...you stop and ask yourself,
"What would Tucker do?”

27:54.255 --> 27:55.449
And then you go do that.

27:55.623 --> 28:00.219
Well, unfortunately, we can't both go
after the girl with the lowest self-esteem.

28:00.395 --> 28:04.229
-Now, can we?
-We can try.

28:04.399 --> 28:06.390
Speak of the devil.

28:06.568 --> 28:10.060
What's up? You finally ready to hook up
or we need more shots first?

28:10.238 --> 28:11.705
She's the bride.

28:11.873 --> 28:15.536
You talk a big game, Mr. Man.

28:15.710 --> 28:18.679
But you don't look like
much of a drinker to me.

28:18.847 --> 28:20.781
Oh, really? Are you talking to me?

28:20.949 --> 28:23.941
You couldn't tie my drinking shoes.

28:24.119 --> 28:25.746
Let's do shots, then.

28:25.920 --> 28:28.650
Oh! Isn't she precious?

28:28.823 --> 28:30.450
We'll do teams. It'll be fun.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.320
-"It will be fun."
-Okay, fine.

28:32.494 --> 28:34.018
-"We will do teams."
-Let's do it.

28:34.195 --> 28:36.425
Bachelor and hottest guy, me, duh...

28:36.598 --> 28:38.964
...versus bachelorette
and your hottest friend.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.965
-I think your friend's hotter.
-Yeah?

28:41.136 --> 28:43.696
Talk to him for five minutes
and tell me what you think.

28:43.872 --> 28:46.932
Let's get down to business.
Line them up. And no girly shit either.

28:47.108 --> 28:49.440
If it has sugar in it, it's not a real shot.

28:58.253 --> 29:02.019
So what's up with Mary, Queen of Twats
over there?

29:02.190 --> 29:04.556
-You know how it is.
-Yeah.

29:04.726 --> 29:06.887
It'd suck to be such an angry bitch.

29:07.061 --> 29:09.052
She can be lots of fun
when she wants to be.

29:09.230 --> 29:12.688
When is that? When she's luring
small children into her gingerbread house?

29:12.867 --> 29:14.664
No. She isn't that bad.

29:14.836 --> 29:17.168
Women are the worst
at judging their friends.

29:17.338 --> 29:19.397
-She's really sweet.
-Bums wouldn't fuck her.

29:19.574 --> 29:21.269
I don't know about bums.

29:21.443 --> 29:23.104
Maybe titty fuck her.

29:34.289 --> 29:37.383
For the record, I just wanted
to disagree with my friend Tucker--

29:37.559 --> 29:38.958
Oh, baby.

29:39.127 --> 29:41.118
Grillionaire.

29:41.696 --> 29:46.258
I got ice, whips, ho’s, money
Got ice, whips, ho’s, money

29:46.434 --> 29:48.026
You like this guy?

29:48.203 --> 29:52.139
I love him. He is hot.

29:52.307 --> 29:55.504
How they do, baby
Grillionaire in the house

29:55.677 --> 29:59.044
How they do, baby
Grillionaire in the house

29:59.214 --> 30:00.476
Yeah, buddy

30:00.648 --> 30:07.178
Get away from me, or I'm gonna carve
another fuck hole in your torso.

30:21.002 --> 30:24.165
Sorry, man.
Want me to ask them to turn it off?

30:24.339 --> 30:25.636
Yes.

30:26.207 --> 30:29.074
You gotta admit, though, man,
it is kind of catchy.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.506
It's a good fucking hook.

30:30.678 --> 30:33.272
Ice, ice, whips, whips, ho’s, ho’s, money

30:33.448 --> 30:36.008
Ice, ice, whips, whips, ho’s, ho’s, money

30:36.184 --> 30:37.276
Got it?
Ice, ice, whips--

30:37.452 --> 30:40.910
All right, all right, all right. We'll stop.
Okay, just--

30:41.523 --> 30:42.888
Where the ho’s at?

30:43.525 --> 30:47.586
This is for all you
bitches, ho's, and pricks.

30:47.762 --> 30:51.926
We wouldn't talk to any of you
if we didn't have dicks. Tucker Max.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.362
Who's Tucker Max?

30:53.535 --> 30:55.332
A rapist.

30:55.503 --> 30:56.765
I can't. I'm done.

30:56.938 --> 30:58.235
What?

30:58.406 --> 30:59.703
Six shots.

30:59.874 --> 31:01.398
That's it? Six shots?

31:01.576 --> 31:04.670
Oh, you may be able to vote and drive,
but you will never be equal.

31:04.846 --> 31:07.178
-It's embarrassing.
-Why are you talking to him?

31:07.348 --> 31:10.715
-He's just messing around.
-Come on, he's cute.

31:10.885 --> 31:12.944
Cute, like full-blown AIDS.

31:13.121 --> 31:16.955
No, he's not. Everything he says
is disgusting and misogynist.

31:17.125 --> 31:20.253
Uh.... No, it isn't.

31:20.428 --> 31:22.862
If I said women
belong chained to a stove...

31:23.031 --> 31:25.056
...with enough slack
to reach the bedroom...

31:25.233 --> 31:28.828
...because those are the places that
your rib-stealing gender's worth a damn...

31:29.003 --> 31:31.563
-...that would be misogynist.
-Would be true.

31:31.739 --> 31:33.900
Excuse me?

31:34.075 --> 31:37.738
What I said was sexist
and a fucking joke.

31:37.912 --> 31:40.710
Not that your pageant-girl ass
would know the difference.

31:40.882 --> 31:41.906
-Hey.
-That's much.

31:42.083 --> 31:43.710
-What?
-Fine. You know what?

31:43.885 --> 31:45.750
You're sexist and misogynist.

31:45.920 --> 31:47.251
Good for you.

31:47.422 --> 31:50.619
Tucker, you misogynist Neanderthal.

31:50.792 --> 31:54.523
Why dost thou hate women so?

31:54.696 --> 31:57.688
That's the thing.
I don't hate women. I love women.

31:57.865 --> 31:59.856
Why else would I put up
with all their shit?

32:00.034 --> 32:01.661
Now you're being kind of mean.

32:01.836 --> 32:03.531
Yeah, you know what?

32:03.705 --> 32:05.002
You're an ass.

32:06.007 --> 32:09.135
I just don't like her as a person...

32:09.310 --> 32:11.278
...because she's a negative fucking bitch.

32:11.446 --> 32:14.006
That has nothing to do
with whether or not she has tits.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.582
-Hey.
-Tucker.

32:17.085 --> 32:18.848
That's not good game.

32:20.321 --> 32:22.050
-You're really mean.
-Yeah.

32:22.223 --> 32:25.681
Yeah. You know what?
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.685
-Yeah.
-It was going so good.

32:28.863 --> 32:31.423
We actually made friends.
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

32:31.599 --> 32:33.123
Asshole.

32:33.668 --> 32:35.499
Wait, wait, wait. Guys, come on, sorry.

32:35.670 --> 32:37.433
Listen, I just want to apologize.

32:37.972 --> 32:40.031
You'll have to forgive my friend, all right?

32:40.208 --> 32:42.574
-He's got mommy issues.
-What do you mean?

32:43.111 --> 32:45.306
Mommy was the life of the party.

32:45.647 --> 32:48.013
Mommy, where do babies come from?

32:48.182 --> 32:51.913
Go ask your deadbeat father
and his fancy new wife.

32:52.253 --> 32:53.720
He really is a good guy, honest.

32:53.888 --> 32:56.322
He's just sometimes
a little quick on the trigger.

32:57.425 --> 32:59.325
Why don't you just come to
the strip club?

32:59.494 --> 33:01.826
-Drinks will be on the asshole.
-Yeah, come on.

33:01.996 --> 33:04.396
That sounds like a plan.

33:04.565 --> 33:06.157
What strip club you guys going to?

33:06.334 --> 33:08.427
-It's called Avarice.
-I've never heard of it.

33:08.603 --> 33:11.094
That's because they don't
let prudish bitches in.

33:11.272 --> 33:12.762
Tucker.

33:12.940 --> 33:14.931
She's not a bitch.

33:15.109 --> 33:16.974
She's a snatch napkin.

33:18.780 --> 33:20.907
It was nice to meet you.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.674
Oh, my God.

33:23.217 --> 33:25.378
Call Information.
Find out where this club is.

33:25.553 --> 33:27.384
What?
I thought you knew where it was.

33:27.555 --> 33:29.648
No, dude. I was fucking half drunk.

33:29.824 --> 33:32.384
-I don't know precisely where it is.
-You said you knew.

33:32.560 --> 33:33.584
-I said that?
-Yeah.

33:33.761 --> 33:37.128
I can't be held accountable for the things
that come out of my mouth.

33:40.301 --> 33:44.738
I'd just like to remind everyone that
we're going down a strange, dark alley...

33:44.906 --> 33:47.966
...on the advice of a drunken hobo.

33:48.142 --> 33:50.167
So?

33:50.344 --> 33:52.676
Yeah, I don't really see a problem, either.

33:52.847 --> 33:54.508
All right. This has gotta be it.

33:54.682 --> 33:56.877
This spot. It must be.

33:58.219 --> 34:01.154
What's up, man? How's it going?
You having a good night?

34:02.390 --> 34:03.880
Cool.

34:04.058 --> 34:06.549
All right

34:13.434 --> 34:17.199
Break me down
You got a lovely face

34:17.371 --> 34:19.362
We're going to your place

34:19.540 --> 34:22.976
But now you got to
Freak me out

34:23.143 --> 34:26.601
Scream so loud
Get fucking laid

34:26.781 --> 34:29.681
You want me to stay

34:29.851 --> 34:32.513
But I got to make my way

34:33.020 --> 34:34.885
Hey
You're a crazy bitch

34:35.056 --> 34:37.456
But you fuck so good
I'm on top of it

34:37.625 --> 34:40.185
When I dream
I'm doing you all night

34:40.360 --> 34:41.554
Scratches all down my back

34:41.728 --> 34:43.094
Oh, that's a hundred.

34:44.831 --> 34:46.060
Oh, man.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.469
I'm going with you.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.530
-Hey.
-How are you doing?

34:52.706 --> 34:54.004
-You're a maniac.
-Let's sit.

34:54.175 --> 34:56.507
-Great.
-I'm better now that you came....

34:56.677 --> 35:00.272
Unless your breasts expel vodka and tonic,
you can feel free to leave.

35:00.448 --> 35:04.248
Oh, don't worry, baby,
the drinks will be here any minute.

35:04.685 --> 35:07.950
Well, in the meantime,
I am obligated to inform you...

35:08.122 --> 35:12.889
...pursuant to Megan's Law,
that I am a convicted sex offender.

35:13.060 --> 35:14.288
So how old are you?

35:15.797 --> 35:18.630
Okay, fine. Rape's not funny,
but murder can be.

35:19.367 --> 35:20.766
Murder's not funny either.

35:20.935 --> 35:23.460
Maybe not to you,
but if the murderer was a clown...

35:23.638 --> 35:26.198
...that would be funny to me.

35:26.374 --> 35:27.398
How is that funny?

35:27.575 --> 35:33.377
Because he is happy on the outside
but sad on the inside.

35:33.915 --> 35:35.075
What?

35:35.249 --> 35:37.649
Sad clown wanna kill somebody?

35:41.289 --> 35:43.223
-Tear.
-Get away from me. Don't touch me.

35:43.391 --> 35:44.983
Wait. Here. Here.

35:45.159 --> 35:49.118
-What's wrong with him?
-Oh, he had a bad breakup.

35:49.297 --> 35:50.491
You have a friend for him?

35:50.665 --> 35:52.565
My friends would never put up with that.

35:52.733 --> 35:55.566
Okay, I'm gonna call
a quick timeout here...

35:55.736 --> 35:57.795
...while the lesser comedians
of the group...

35:57.972 --> 36:00.497
...have a chance
to make their own stripper abuse joke.

36:00.675 --> 36:02.165
-What is your prob--?
-Chh!

36:02.343 --> 36:03.867
I would rather mainline Drano...

36:04.045 --> 36:06.570
...than listen to another second
of your whore prattle.

36:06.747 --> 36:10.581
-Less talkie. More booby. Now.
-You know what, I don't need this.

36:10.751 --> 36:13.345
Said the fat girl to the cupcake.

36:13.521 --> 36:14.613
-I'm sorry.
-Bye, whore.

36:14.789 --> 36:16.313
Candy, I'll miss you.

36:16.490 --> 36:19.618
-Bambi, I thought we had something.
-Three down, only 97 more to go.

36:19.794 --> 36:20.920
Good job, dumb-ass.

36:32.740 --> 36:35.868
And now coming to the auxiliary stage...

36:36.043 --> 36:39.240
...she has Russian hands
and Roman fingers.

36:39.413 --> 36:41.973
Give it up for Natasha.

36:42.149 --> 36:44.845
--for the heart

36:45.019 --> 36:48.546
Dull headache

36:48.723 --> 36:53.524
This is just the start
Of a mad pursuit

36:53.694 --> 37:01.624
Chasing down the telephone wire

37:01.802 --> 37:09.208
Racing down the road
You can’t lose her

37:09.377 --> 37:12.676
You'll try to skip town
She'll find you

37:12.847 --> 37:16.146
Are you guys drinking water?
We don't allow Mormons in here.

37:16.317 --> 37:18.342
Yes, but we're also drinking
Thug Passion.

37:18.519 --> 37:22.785
It's what your mom put in your bottle so
she could watch Young and the Restless.

37:22.957 --> 37:26.051
My mom used bourbon.
All the sugar in cognac made me hyper.

37:26.494 --> 37:28.792
And judging by the distance
between your eyes...

37:28.963 --> 37:32.023
...I'd say your mom drank it all
while you were still in the womb.

37:33.901 --> 37:35.459
Did she just make a fetal alcohol joke?

37:35.636 --> 37:37.604
-Whoa!
-Wait, wait, wait.

37:38.539 --> 37:40.404
When you're done changing
or whatever...

37:40.574 --> 37:43.042
...come back over here
and keep talking shit to him.

37:43.210 --> 37:44.507
-Please.
-Thank you.

37:47.615 --> 37:49.446
-Oh, God.
-Which one do you want?

37:49.617 --> 37:52.552
-I'll take the--
-I'll take the one in the pink.

37:52.720 --> 37:55.689
And now coming to
the main stage, she's magic on the bowl.

37:55.856 --> 37:56.914
She's Whoredini.

37:57.091 --> 38:01.755
If we get a champagne room,
we can do anything we want.

38:01.929 --> 38:04.124
If we get a hotel room,
we can do anything too.

38:04.298 --> 38:07.290
True. But then I don't get paid.

38:07.468 --> 38:09.095
I'll give you $20.

38:09.270 --> 38:11.135
It's more like 400, baby.

38:11.305 --> 38:13.364
-Four hundred?
-Oh, yeah.

38:13.541 --> 38:18.843
But you're cute and funny.
I'll do it for 350.

38:19.313 --> 38:22.009
-Twenty-five.
-Three hundred and twenty-five?

38:22.183 --> 38:23.309
No, just 25.

38:24.785 --> 38:27.777
I have to pay the club $1 00
just to get the room for an hour.

38:27.955 --> 38:30.423
That's okay.
My attention span won't last for an hour.

38:32.860 --> 38:34.691
-Asshole.
-I'll give you $30.

38:34.862 --> 38:37.922
-That won't even buy our drinks.
-Oh, shit.

38:38.399 --> 38:39.627
That's what you get.

38:39.800 --> 38:42.735
Hold on. If I'm so cute and funny,
why are you even charging me?

38:42.903 --> 38:44.666
That's no way to start a relationship.

38:44.839 --> 38:48.036
Who said I wanted a relationship?
I already have a boyfriend.

38:48.209 --> 38:51.076
I don't want that kind of relationship.
I just wanna fuck you.

38:51.245 --> 38:54.112
-Just fuck me?
-Yeah, I'd make a great fuck buddy.

38:54.281 --> 38:58.081
All right, potential fuck buddy,
how big is your dick?

38:58.252 --> 38:59.583
How big is your mouth?

38:59.754 --> 39:02.086
She's got eyes as big as her titties.

39:02.256 --> 39:07.319
And, boy, is she a cute little piece of tail.
It's Bambi.

39:20.341 --> 39:21.831
If you must know...

39:22.009 --> 39:25.604
...my parents yelled at me,
sent me to my room and ignored me.

39:26.113 --> 39:29.674
If I was your mom, I would have
locked you up and ignored you too.

39:29.850 --> 39:34.446
If you were my mom, I would've been raised
by a talentless hooker rather than a shrew.

39:34.622 --> 39:35.748
There's a win-win.

39:35.923 --> 39:38.221
You're awfully bitter
for a pasty-faced shut-in.

39:38.392 --> 39:41.987
Always been this mean, or did some girl
just trade you in for a better model?

39:42.163 --> 39:43.494
Holy shit.

39:43.664 --> 39:46.861
She's like a hot Miss Cleo.
Yeah, his girlfriend did just dump him.

39:47.034 --> 39:48.558
For Grillionaire, of all people.

39:48.736 --> 39:50.169
Grillionaire?

39:50.337 --> 39:54.330
Like, "how they do, baby"?
Grillionaire with the diamonds on his teeth?

39:54.842 --> 39:56.309
Oh, wow.

39:56.477 --> 40:01.779
She may be a vacuous slut with no taste,
but at least she's not a stripper.

40:01.949 --> 40:03.211
You think you're so clever.

40:03.651 --> 40:06.176
I know a hundred insecure assholes
just like you.

40:06.353 --> 40:09.811
I'm sure all your mother's boyfriends
were great guys.

40:09.990 --> 40:12.117
If I had a dollar
for every broken-home joke...

40:12.293 --> 40:14.761
...I'd have enough to buy
Comic-Con tickets for you...

40:14.929 --> 40:17.830
...and all the other orc-mage failures
on your buddy list.

40:19.867 --> 40:21.425
Whatever, I've gotta go.

40:21.602 --> 40:23.092
Whoa! No, no, no.

40:23.504 --> 40:25.096
-Stay, please.
-Finish him.

40:25.272 --> 40:28.469
-No, I've gotta get home soon.
-You need to keep talking shit to him.

40:28.642 --> 40:32.442
Yeah, he can't stand it when a woman
that gets the best of him. Stay, please.

40:32.613 --> 40:35.013
That's unfortunate
because he's a good-looking guy.

40:35.182 --> 40:37.446
I've learned my lesson
with guys like your friend.

40:37.618 --> 40:38.642
No, he's different.

40:38.819 --> 40:41.219
I promise you,
there is a flower inside that onion.

40:41.388 --> 40:43.822
-You just have to peel back the layers...
-Peel away.

40:43.991 --> 40:45.515
...and fight back the tears.

40:45.693 --> 40:48.719
-I'll pay your rate. Just talk shit to him.
-Please.

40:49.763 --> 40:51.560
He needs this.

40:53.501 --> 40:55.492
Dance, monkey.

40:55.669 --> 40:57.967
Dance for your dollar.

40:58.906 --> 41:00.271
Could've done without that.

41:00.441 --> 41:02.500
-I'll pick it up for you.
-You can keep that.

41:02.676 --> 41:04.644
All I have to do is insult him?
No dancing?

41:04.812 --> 41:06.871
-That's it.
-Great.

41:07.448 --> 41:09.382
-I can't believe that worked.
-Fuck.

41:11.285 --> 41:12.843
He might have you there.

41:13.020 --> 41:14.647
I'm Lara.

41:14.822 --> 41:15.948
What's your name?

41:16.991 --> 41:19.391
It's Drew, but why don't we
skip the pleasantries...

41:19.560 --> 41:22.085
...and go to the part
where you call me Captain Kirk...

41:22.263 --> 41:24.925
...and give me a hand job in the alley?

41:25.232 --> 41:27.666
You're a Star Trek nerd?

41:27.835 --> 41:29.564
Color me shocked.

41:29.737 --> 41:32.729
Live long and prosper, dork.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.499
Okay, I'm a dork?

41:34.675 --> 41:38.008
You are the one with
a video-game character's name.

41:39.246 --> 41:43.080
Genius. That game came out
after I was born.

41:43.250 --> 41:44.842
I was named after Agustin Lara.

41:45.019 --> 41:46.452
Wait, wait, wait, who is that?

41:46.620 --> 41:49.282
A famous Mexican intellectual.

41:50.558 --> 41:52.048
That's a funny joke.

41:52.226 --> 41:55.286
No funnier than you catching your
girlfriend blowing Grillionaire.

41:55.963 --> 41:59.558
Body blow, body blow,
body blow, left hook.

42:00.034 --> 42:03.197
Wait a second, wait a second.
You like "Mike Tyson Punch Out"?

42:03.370 --> 42:04.632
Bullshit, bullshit.

42:04.805 --> 42:06.830
Who was your favorite guy
to fight? Quick.

42:07.007 --> 42:10.135
Soda Popinski, because he was
drinking a 40 in his picture.

42:10.744 --> 42:13.645
Oh! Dude, this is your dream girl.

42:13.814 --> 42:15.281
If you don't make this happen...

42:15.449 --> 42:18.077
...you will be a disgrace
to the entire "Halo" community.

42:18.252 --> 42:22.018
-How dare you?
-Oh, I will destroy you in "Halo."

42:22.189 --> 42:23.588
Oh, yeah, sure you will.

42:23.757 --> 42:26.885
And you're an exotic dancer,
not a stripper.

42:27.061 --> 42:28.255
You can't handle a girl...

42:28.429 --> 42:30.556
...who's better than you
at some stupid game?

42:30.731 --> 42:32.824
Okay, you can beat me at "Halo"?

42:33.000 --> 42:36.060
Hey, while we're in this fantasy land...

42:36.237 --> 42:38.865
...why don't we drive your flying car
over to the bank...

42:39.039 --> 42:41.030
...and get you approved for a home loan.

42:41.208 --> 42:45.645
-I bet $100 she'll beat you in "Halo."
-I'm not betting on a video game.

42:45.813 --> 42:47.110
Gambling is illegal.

42:47.281 --> 42:48.908
What?

42:51.885 --> 42:53.443
I smell pussy.

42:53.621 --> 42:55.589
Then douche before work.

42:55.756 --> 42:56.916
Two hundred dollars.

42:57.992 --> 42:59.289
I'm not-- I can't leave--

42:59.460 --> 43:01.587
Dan's bachelor party
is the reason we're here.

43:01.762 --> 43:03.821
No, don't let me keep you here.

43:03.998 --> 43:07.991
Nothing would make me happier than
to see her whip your ass at a video game.

43:08.469 --> 43:13.566
I would consider it if we had a place
to play and I had my special controller.

43:13.741 --> 43:16.904
Well, you're in luck,
because my shift just ended.

43:17.077 --> 43:19.011
We can play at my house,
I have everything.

43:19.179 --> 43:22.080
Except your candy-ass little controller.

43:22.549 --> 43:24.107
-Then it's a bet.
-No.

43:24.285 --> 43:28.119
I'm not going
to some vile stripper den.

43:28.289 --> 43:30.814
You know her baby daddy
is just waiting there for me...

43:30.991 --> 43:35.655
-...so he can roll me and steal my organs.
-How are you friends with this guy?

43:35.829 --> 43:38.798
-I have no idea how you're attracted to him.
-I don't know.

43:38.966 --> 43:41.901
Probably has something to do with
my caustic sense of humor...

43:42.069 --> 43:45.800
...and the inability of your various
stepfathers to show you any affection.

43:47.207 --> 43:48.572
Probably.

43:50.044 --> 43:52.274
Fellas, I've got a message
from the bar staff.

43:52.446 --> 43:58.316
Tonight's house special is Thug's Passion
and it's two for one.

43:58.485 --> 44:00.453
-Hey, honey, what’s up?
-Hey.

44:00.621 --> 44:01.883
You've finally calmed down?

44:02.056 --> 44:04.115
Yeah. You know,
I'm not mad at you anymore.

44:04.558 --> 44:05.957
Gee, thanks.

44:06.126 --> 44:07.889
-Are you having fun?
-Oh, yeah.

44:08.062 --> 44:09.757
Strip clubs are all the same.

44:09.930 --> 44:11.830
How's Tucker handling
the no-touch rule?

44:12.700 --> 44:14.793
You know, he's coping.

44:14.968 --> 44:18.404
Welcome to the stage,
she's got plenty of fright...

44:18.572 --> 44:19.834
...with none of the height.

44:20.007 --> 44:22.498
She's Salem’s very own Rainbow Sprite.

44:22.676 --> 44:24.803
-Dan, where are you?
-A club.

44:24.978 --> 44:27.139
No, where are you? Geographically.

44:27.314 --> 44:29.043
Um....

44:29.216 --> 44:30.513
Close by.

44:34.855 --> 44:36.288
I can't believe this.

44:36.457 --> 44:40.086
Young man, I don't think
we're gonna need this anymore.

44:40.260 --> 44:42.854
-Put Drew on the phone.
-He's leaving with a stripper.

44:43.030 --> 44:45.726
Dan, we both know that's ridiculous.
Put Drew on the phone.

44:45.899 --> 44:47.127
Hey. It's Kristy.

44:47.301 --> 44:49.826
She wants to talk to you.
She thinks we're in Richmond.

44:50.003 --> 44:52.665
-Just tell her we're in Richmond.
-Yeah.

44:53.407 --> 44:55.170
-Hi, Kristy.
-Drew, where are you guys?

44:55.342 --> 44:58.709
We're at a strip club in Salem. Gotta go.

44:59.179 --> 45:00.578
I'm not lying for you cretins.

45:00.748 --> 45:03.740
My moral compass doesn't point
directly down my pants.

45:03.917 --> 45:05.111
Dude, what did--?

45:05.285 --> 45:06.752
What do you--?

45:07.087 --> 45:09.146
-Fuck.
-Fuck.

45:09.523 --> 45:11.548
Dan, why did you go to Salem?

45:11.725 --> 45:13.693
I don't know. Tucker....

45:13.861 --> 45:15.123
Again, Dan?

45:15.295 --> 45:16.660
Again with the Tucker.

45:16.830 --> 45:18.127
What are you, his keeper?

45:18.565 --> 45:22.262
Is that what you are? You just hang out,
swoop in and save him and take the hit?

45:22.436 --> 45:25.132
-I don't know.
-I don't understand why you lied to me.

45:26.407 --> 45:28.967
We promised that we'd always be honest
with each other.

45:29.143 --> 45:31.236
I don't know why we lied. I just--

45:31.412 --> 45:34.711
Enough with the "we."
I don't care why Tucker did what he did.

45:35.182 --> 45:36.342
I only care what you did.

45:39.052 --> 45:41.043
Honey, you're really that mad?

45:41.655 --> 45:43.885
I don't know what to think. I gotta go.

45:45.993 --> 45:47.324
Fuck.

45:49.830 --> 45:51.821
Well, that's the last time I listen to you.

45:51.999 --> 45:54.695
Dude, whatever, she'll get over it.
Tell her it's my fault.

45:54.868 --> 45:56.392
It is your fucking fault.

45:56.804 --> 45:59.534
Six of one. Dude, don't sweat it, man.

45:59.706 --> 46:01.833
What happens in Salem, stays in Salem.

46:02.009 --> 46:05.740
Well, clearly it doesn't. My fiancée,
who I lied to because of you, asshole...

46:05.913 --> 46:07.574
...is in Richmond and she's pissed.

46:07.748 --> 46:09.648
It's all right. Here.

46:10.484 --> 46:15.217
This is the 20-minute call
for all dancers to the main stage...

46:15.389 --> 46:20.053
...because it is time
for bachelor party duty.

46:20.227 --> 46:22.024
-Dude.
-Someone needs a spanking.

46:22.196 --> 46:24.460
Dude, this is it, this is it.

46:24.631 --> 46:26.360
You need a spanking, man. This is it.

46:26.533 --> 46:29.525
Are you fired up?
This is for you, go out on stage, man.

46:30.270 --> 46:32.864
She's my cherry pie

46:33.040 --> 46:35.440
Cool drink of water
Such a sweet surprise

46:35.609 --> 46:38.407
Let's give it
up for Rainbow Sprite, everybody.

46:38.846 --> 46:41.076
I'll be right back. Stay there.

46:41.248 --> 46:42.579
Take your time, dickhead.

46:43.450 --> 46:44.974
-Where are you going?
-I just, um--

46:45.152 --> 46:47.211
-I'll be right back.
-What about your friend?

46:47.387 --> 46:50.185
Oh, he's fine. He's fine.
Don't worry about him. Big boy.

47:00.567 --> 47:01.591
Fuck.

47:02.903 --> 47:05.235
Hey, I'm Gulliver. How are you doing?

47:08.475 --> 47:11.171
She's sweet and sticky,
but she won't give you a cavity.

47:11.345 --> 47:13.609
-Fuck.
-Let's say hello to Candy.

47:14.047 --> 47:17.881
This place sucks. You wanna get
out of here? Do something more fun?

47:30.931 --> 47:33.195
I need to tell you something
before we go inside.

47:33.367 --> 47:35.232
Oh, I fucking knew it.

47:35.402 --> 47:37.927
I'm gonna get jumped.
They're gonna take my kidneys.

47:38.105 --> 47:41.836
No. I have a son. He'll be asleep.

47:42.009 --> 47:46.070
But I wanted to tell you before you tripped
over his army men in the living room.

47:51.451 --> 47:52.713
What's his name?

47:52.886 --> 47:56.344
Jack. He's 7.

47:57.758 --> 48:01.125
Is he named after his baby daddy
or the liquor on which he was conceived?

48:01.295 --> 48:04.696
Neither. It's just a strong name.

48:04.865 --> 48:07.425
I think a little boy needs a strong name.

48:07.601 --> 48:09.569
I'm not a fan
of those androgynous names...

48:09.736 --> 48:12.227
...like Pat or Jesse or Drew.

48:13.707 --> 48:15.504
Bitch.

48:17.044 --> 48:19.103
I can't say I'm shocked.

48:19.279 --> 48:24.012
Having a kid is one of the top three excuses
strippers use to justify their career choice.

48:24.585 --> 48:25.711
Really?

48:26.320 --> 48:27.810
And what are the other two?

48:27.988 --> 48:30.957
The paying my way through college lie
heads up that list.

48:31.124 --> 48:33.388
That's in the Whore Logic Hall of Fame.

48:43.303 --> 48:46.670
And the other one?

48:47.174 --> 48:51.804
It's better than being a hooker
or doing porn.

48:54.247 --> 48:58.707
You know,
strippers don't actually say that.

48:58.885 --> 49:02.286
Bullshit, they don't.
You need to watch Maury Povich.

49:06.126 --> 49:09.095
Jack, aren't you supposed to be in bed?

49:09.262 --> 49:10.991
Bunny said I could stay up and play.

49:11.164 --> 49:15.191
But it doesn't matter.
Your bedtime is your bedtime.

49:19.206 --> 49:20.230
Greetings.

49:24.978 --> 49:26.377
Uh....

49:29.149 --> 49:30.639
The army men the good guys?

49:33.086 --> 49:36.249
I see you have
some robot truck men here too.

49:36.423 --> 49:38.050
You shouldn't mix genres like that.

49:38.225 --> 49:42.889
It screws up the morale
and jeopardizes the efficacy of your tactics.

49:44.531 --> 49:46.294
Okay, I guess we can work with it.

49:47.300 --> 49:50.292
What exactly are you playing?

49:52.005 --> 49:57.341
Well, the GI Bobs
are gonna surprise attack those Legos.

50:01.882 --> 50:05.010
I know that you are but 7 years old.

50:06.186 --> 50:09.622
This rigmarole you have here
just won't work.

50:09.923 --> 50:11.618
Your flanks are exposed.

50:11.792 --> 50:15.091
You're vulnerable to an enfilade
from Lego artillery.

50:15.262 --> 50:19.460
I think it's time
that you learn the proper way...

50:19.633 --> 50:21.260
...to set up an L-shaped ambush.

50:24.237 --> 50:25.636
What's a flank?

50:29.009 --> 50:30.169
It's a good thing I came.

50:30.444 --> 50:32.844
And now, it's time
for our man of the hour...

50:33.013 --> 50:35.038
...our bachelor of the night.

50:35.215 --> 50:37.206
Give it up for Big Dan.

50:57.504 --> 50:59.131
I had a baby named Jane

50:59.306 --> 51:00.330
She could shake that thing

51:00.507 --> 51:02.998
Said her daddy used to hang
With Johnny Coltrane

51:03.176 --> 51:05.542
She sang a soul train
With a friend named Jen

51:05.712 --> 51:08.112
Her booty was bigger
Than a Mercedes-Benz

51:23.163 --> 51:24.790
No, no, no.

51:25.232 --> 51:26.961
I said off.

51:28.335 --> 51:29.359
No, no, no.

51:44.651 --> 51:45.879
You asshole.

51:48.188 --> 51:51.055
-Get on your feet.
-Come on, asshole. Party's over.

51:51.224 --> 51:53.715
-Yeah.
-Get out of here.

51:56.296 --> 51:58.127
That's it.

52:00.467 --> 52:01.934
-Asshole.
-Okay.

52:02.435 --> 52:07.168
Your army men are set up
in the perfect ambush.

52:07.340 --> 52:12.778
Once the Legos get to the kill zone,
no matter what they do, they're toast.

52:12.946 --> 52:13.935
Yes.

52:16.116 --> 52:18.914
You might not grow up to be a failure
at life after all, kid.

52:19.519 --> 52:23.819
Okay. Now it's time for bed.

52:23.990 --> 52:29.292
Say thank you to Drew for teaching you
how to attack your Legos.

52:29.462 --> 52:31.089
Thanks, Drew.

52:31.264 --> 52:34.722
Tomorrow can you teach me
other ambushes?

52:34.901 --> 52:38.234
I think I've stunted your growth
enough for one week.

52:39.573 --> 52:42.633
But maybe next time I can teach you
how to use standoffish humor...

52:42.809 --> 52:46.404
...as a mask for your inability
to relate to people on a personal level.

52:46.580 --> 52:48.605
Yay.

52:48.782 --> 52:50.409
-Yeah.
-Good night, Drew.

52:50.584 --> 52:52.142
Good night, Jack.

53:05.165 --> 53:06.632
Fuck.

53:12.205 --> 53:13.604
What the hell are you doing?

53:16.142 --> 53:18.076
Oh, uh....

53:18.411 --> 53:21.107
Don't mind me, boys.
I'm just baking a quiche.

53:21.715 --> 53:24.240
Are you pissing?
That's an actual offense.

53:24.417 --> 53:26.078
Ooh.

53:27.921 --> 53:31.687
-Mr. Plastic-Badge gonna give me a ticket?
-What the fuck did you just say?

53:31.858 --> 53:33.985
How will I ever face my life again?

53:34.694 --> 53:36.559
Let me ask you something,
Deputy Dipshit.

53:38.031 --> 53:39.760
Are you a cop...

53:39.933 --> 53:44.336
...because you have a GED or because
you have erectile dysfunction?

53:44.838 --> 53:46.601
-I'm really curious to know.
-Hey, hey.

53:46.773 --> 53:48.866
-Are you goddamn shitting me?
-What the fuck?

53:49.709 --> 53:52.234
Fuck. Fuck.

53:52.879 --> 53:54.540
"You didn't lie to her, Dan. I did."

53:54.714 --> 53:56.375
"You didn't lie to her, Dan. I did."

53:56.549 --> 53:59.643
Stupid shit. You know what they did?
They left me at a strip club.

53:59.819 --> 54:01.787
My friends are fucking idiots.

54:01.955 --> 54:06.153
"And the syrup nugget, it explodes in your
mouth and then I'll skull fuck you."

54:06.326 --> 54:08.385
Fucking stupid.

54:08.929 --> 54:12.660
Fuck it. I gotta get the fuck out of here
and call her. I don't have friends.

54:12.832 --> 54:14.197
My friends are douche bags.

54:14.367 --> 54:17.859
You guys are probably more fun
to hang out with than my fucking friends.

54:18.038 --> 54:20.199
They're fucking stupid.

54:21.741 --> 54:23.265
All I wanted was a bouncy castle.

54:23.443 --> 54:26.003
A bouncy castle at the reception.
Just a bouncy castle.

54:26.179 --> 54:29.376
I gotta get out. Gotta call my wife.
She's never gonna take me back.

54:29.816 --> 54:33.616
Who's with me? Who's with me?
Somebody has gotta be with me.

54:33.787 --> 54:36.847
I am the only one who speaks English.

54:37.290 --> 54:39.884
-That's no problem, ése.
-What?

54:47.567 --> 54:49.159
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

54:49.336 --> 54:51.304
Yeah.

54:51.471 --> 54:54.440
Who's with me? Who--? Yeah.

54:59.112 --> 55:00.306
Revolution!

55:03.783 --> 55:07.275
-Hey, look, it's the cops.
-All right, assholes. Last chance.

55:09.222 --> 55:10.814
What the hell is going on in here?

55:10.991 --> 55:14.893
Holy shit, it's like Police Academy,
only gayer.

55:16.429 --> 55:17.896
And you....

55:18.064 --> 55:20.862
-Lights out, motherfucker.
-It's a fucking joke, it's a joke.

55:25.566 --> 55:28.626
"Halo 1” shotgun gun wizard
was the best board.

55:28.803 --> 55:30.498
Totally.

55:32.039 --> 55:33.631
Jack's a good kid.

55:33.808 --> 55:35.571
Damn it.

55:35.976 --> 55:37.136
Thanks.

55:37.311 --> 55:40.246
I mean, I usually wanna kick most kids
into a wood chipper.

55:41.615 --> 55:43.742
How are you kicking my ass?

55:43.918 --> 55:45.715
That means a lot.

55:45.886 --> 55:47.786
He's had a tough time since his dad left.

55:50.758 --> 55:52.020
I told you I was better.

55:52.193 --> 55:54.855
-I can beat Koreans.
-Why did he leave?

55:56.497 --> 56:00.228
Son of a bitch,
where are you even shooting me from?

56:00.401 --> 56:02.232
He thought
that I was cheating on him...

56:02.403 --> 56:05.930
...so he decided to get even
and screw anything that moved.

56:06.774 --> 56:08.332
Were you?

56:09.443 --> 56:10.910
I mean, it wouldn't surprise me.

56:11.078 --> 56:14.275
Your whole gender
is hardwired for whoredom.

56:14.448 --> 56:16.006
Are you in pink armor?

56:16.183 --> 56:18.777
I hate it when men
randomly bash women.

56:18.953 --> 56:22.389
It's like this pathetic defense mechanism
you guys put up...

56:22.556 --> 56:26.287
...when you know you're attracted
to a woman who might not be into you.

56:27.128 --> 56:29.392
-That's not-- That's not true.
-Yes, it is.

56:29.563 --> 56:31.622
It's so much easier
to call a girl a whore...

56:31.799 --> 56:34.927
...than it is to admit to yourself
she's out of your league.

56:35.202 --> 56:38.365
That is some whore logic
if I've ever heard it.

56:39.740 --> 56:43.301
Anyone is capable
of being a whore, Drew.

56:43.477 --> 56:46.071
Being a woman
doesn't de facto make you one.

56:46.247 --> 56:49.148
It does if you're
a cum-guzzling demon slut.

56:49.316 --> 56:50.908
Fine.

56:51.085 --> 56:54.987
But your ex is only representative of herself,
not her whole gender.

56:55.856 --> 56:58.916
Her actions don't make me a whore
simply because we're both women.

57:03.597 --> 57:05.292
Did you cheat?

57:06.834 --> 57:07.858
No.

57:13.741 --> 57:16.801
If you ever wanna find love again
you're gonna have to get over...

57:16.977 --> 57:19.844
...these childish notions that you have.

57:20.414 --> 57:21.938
If you don't...

57:22.116 --> 57:26.712
...your personal life will remain
the steaming pile of shit that it is now.

57:28.289 --> 57:31.690
Game over. Killing frenzy.

57:33.961 --> 57:35.428
Motherfucker.

57:36.163 --> 57:37.528
You're the pink mist.

57:39.200 --> 57:43.034
If I kiss you, will you shut up already?

58:11.465 --> 58:14.662
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

59:25.239 --> 59:26.570
Where am I?

59:27.641 --> 59:29.302
Uh, uh....

59:34.548 --> 59:37.039
Drunk tank, ése.

59:47.027 --> 59:48.756
That's disgusting.

59:48.929 --> 59:51.625
I hope that wasn't one of you guys.

59:52.132 --> 59:54.259
Fuck. Can I make a call, man?

59:54.435 --> 59:55.993
Sorry.

01:00:07.514 --> 01:00:09.539
-Operator.
-Yeah, hi.

01:00:09.717 --> 01:00:12.811
I need to make a collect call...

01:00:12.987 --> 01:00:19.392
...to 323-351 -7640.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.857
State your name after the beep.

01:00:22.229 --> 01:00:23.890
It's Dan.

01:00:39.546 --> 01:00:41.639
-Operator.
-Uh, yeah.

01:00:41.815 --> 01:00:44.010
Can you try...

01:00:44.284 --> 01:00:50.348
...281 -555-8009?

01:00:50.524 --> 01:00:51.855
State your name after the beep.

01:00:53.193 --> 01:00:54.285
Dan.

01:01:01.168 --> 01:01:02.999
Son of a bitch, where the hell are you?

01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:05.502
-I'm right here, sir.
-No, not you.

01:01:05.672 --> 01:01:09.233
Look, can you just try one more?
Can you try...

01:01:09.877 --> 01:01:13.904
...91 8-555-7640?

01:01:14.081 --> 01:01:15.309
State your name after the beep.

01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:18.174
What the fuck? Are you fucking with me?

01:01:18.352 --> 01:01:21.719
It's Dan, just dial the fucking phone
so I don't spend the last of my days in--

01:01:21.889 --> 01:01:23.288
Fuck!

01:01:30.164 --> 01:01:31.893
-What?
-This is the Salem City...

01:01:32.066 --> 01:01:35.035
-...Jail Operator with a collect call from:
-Are you fucking with me?

01:01:35.202 --> 01:01:38.729
It's Dan, dial the fucking phone
so I don't spend the last of my days--

01:01:38.906 --> 01:01:40.601
-Fuck.
-Daniel?

01:01:40.774 --> 01:01:42.867
Oh, Jesus. Mrs. Jorgens?

01:01:43.043 --> 01:01:44.601
What’s going on?

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.280
Can you get Kristy for me?

01:01:50.451 --> 01:01:53.215
No, I cannot. Where are you?

01:01:54.855 --> 01:01:57.016
I'm in jail.

01:01:58.125 --> 01:02:01.617
-What a shock.
-Mom, is that Dan?

01:02:11.271 --> 01:02:13.000
Fuck.

01:02:14.308 --> 01:02:15.832
-Hey.
-Dude, how did it go?

01:02:16.009 --> 01:02:17.408
-Everything good?
-Of course.

01:02:17.578 --> 01:02:20.103
-What did you think was gonna happen?
-What do I think?

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:24.944
Get away! Mommy! No!
Get away! No! Mommy!

01:02:31.391 --> 01:02:34.155
That's ridiculous.
I already have all those toys.

01:02:35.762 --> 01:02:37.423
Hey, Jack.

01:02:37.598 --> 01:02:39.429
Hey. Hey.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.696
-Where's my 200 bucks?
-Oh, you mean my 200 bucks?

01:02:44.972 --> 01:02:46.439
Yeah, she's good.

01:02:46.607 --> 01:02:48.006
Nice, well played.

01:02:48.575 --> 01:02:49.872
Hey.

01:02:50.344 --> 01:02:51.743
You can have this.

01:02:55.415 --> 01:02:56.973
Wow.

01:02:57.851 --> 01:02:59.978
Thanks, Jack.

01:03:00.154 --> 01:03:02.088
Hey, you know what?

01:03:03.123 --> 01:03:06.320
I want you to have this.

01:03:06.493 --> 01:03:08.427
A GI Bob keychain.

01:03:08.595 --> 01:03:11.189
Bob was the commander
for the soldiers that went to battle.

01:03:11.365 --> 01:03:13.833
-He was my favorite when I was your age.
-Wow.

01:03:14.001 --> 01:03:16.196
You gotta promise me one thing, though.

01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:18.634
You take care of all your soldiers
just like Bob.

01:03:18.805 --> 01:03:21.103
-Especially your mom.
-I promise.

01:03:22.042 --> 01:03:23.475
All right.

01:03:23.644 --> 01:03:25.771
-I'll call you when I get home.
-Okay.

01:03:27.014 --> 01:03:29.448
Keep working on your ambushes, buddy.

01:03:29.616 --> 01:03:31.584
Bye, Drew.

01:03:31.752 --> 01:03:34.812
Did you just give your Bob keychain
to a whore baby?

01:03:34.988 --> 01:03:36.922
She's not a whore.

01:03:38.258 --> 01:03:39.657
Okay.

01:03:40.127 --> 01:03:41.890
Wow.

01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:46.363
Here you go, man.
I got you one of these suckers.

01:03:48.168 --> 01:03:49.795
Where's Dan?

01:04:02.015 --> 01:04:04.074
Holy shit.

01:04:06.186 --> 01:04:08.814
Jesus Christ, man.
What the fuck happened to you?

01:04:14.595 --> 01:04:15.857
Let's fucking go.

01:04:16.029 --> 01:04:19.487
Dude, you are not gonna believe
what happened to me.

01:04:19.666 --> 01:04:22.794
You know the feeling you get
when you're looking for that someone...

01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:26.303
...and you are trying so hard
you think you might never find her?

01:04:26.473 --> 01:04:28.873
And then,
just as you're about to give up...

01:04:29.042 --> 01:04:34.571
...the clouds part, the path widens,
and there she is.

01:04:34.748 --> 01:04:39.685
Gentlemen, last night
I reached the mountaintop.

01:04:39.853 --> 01:04:43.687
Drew, you had just left the bar
when I saw her.

01:04:43.857 --> 01:04:45.688
My midget princess.

01:04:45.859 --> 01:04:50.558
Her dark hair and sparkling eyes
reminded me of Alyssa Milano.

01:04:50.731 --> 01:04:53.461
Her compressed cervical vertebrae
and bowed legs...

01:04:53.634 --> 01:04:56.194
...told me exactly
what Alyssa Milano would look like...

01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:59.396
...if she were placed in a vise
and squished to one-quarter size.

01:04:59.973 --> 01:05:03.204
So as her pigeon-toed feet
carried her past our table...

01:05:03.377 --> 01:05:07.177
...I slid down in my chair,
hoping to catch her eye.

01:05:07.347 --> 01:05:09.008
She looked at me.

01:05:09.683 --> 01:05:11.207
Her mashed-up teeth...

01:05:11.385 --> 01:05:16.413
...sparkling in the oily light
of the novelty condom machine.

01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:22.526
I gave her my unmistakable
I-want-to-fuck-you eyes.

01:05:22.696 --> 01:05:28.965
She shot back a quick
my-spine-hurts face, and I was smitten.

01:05:29.303 --> 01:05:33.330
She went to the bar, ordered a drink.
I took the stool next to hers.

01:05:33.507 --> 01:05:35.236
Hey, I'm Gulliver. How are you doing?

01:05:35.409 --> 01:05:39.072
The beer bottle looked massive
in her tiny little hands.

01:05:39.246 --> 01:05:42.704
All I could think about was how big
those hands would make my penis look.

01:05:42.883 --> 01:05:46.410
-She ate it up.
-I'm not a dwarf, I'm a little person.

01:05:46.586 --> 01:05:48.747
Is that what Doc told you, Grumpy?

01:05:48.922 --> 01:05:52.085
She laughed her tiny little laugh
at my tiny little jokes...

01:05:52.259 --> 01:05:54.523
...and then threw me a fastball
down the middle.

01:05:54.695 --> 01:05:56.629
So, what do you want to do?

01:05:57.097 --> 01:06:00.294
It was the tiny little opening I needed.

01:06:00.467 --> 01:06:02.867
I wanna make a mess in your mouth.

01:06:03.136 --> 01:06:05.866
-Let's go to my place, then.
-Okay.

01:06:06.039 --> 01:06:07.939
Just to be safe, leave the pickax here.

01:06:08.108 --> 01:06:11.976
I don't want you tunneling under the bed,
looking for diamonds. It'll freak me out.

01:06:12.145 --> 01:06:16.548
Without a tiny little second thought,
she swung down from the stool...

01:06:16.717 --> 01:06:19.948
...took my pinky in her sausage fingers
and guided me out the door.

01:06:23.323 --> 01:06:24.483
Wait.

01:06:24.658 --> 01:06:28.594
You mean to tell me
that I have this and this...

01:06:28.762 --> 01:06:31.822
...because you wanted to fuck
an Oompa Loompa, are you serious?

01:06:31.998 --> 01:06:34.967
Dude, it was destiny.

01:06:35.135 --> 01:06:36.625
You remember?

01:06:36.803 --> 01:06:40.068
The midget stripper the professor
was talking about in class yesterday.

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.639
I went on Westlaw...

01:06:41.808 --> 01:06:44.606
...and found out where she worked
before I picked up Drew.

01:06:47.848 --> 01:06:49.975
You've never been
to that strip club before?

01:06:51.351 --> 01:06:54.616
No. I mean, not until last time.

01:06:54.788 --> 01:06:56.346
Holy shit.

01:06:58.725 --> 01:07:00.625
That's why you took us
to that crappy bar.

01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:06.361
That's why you had me call information
to find out where the club was.

01:07:06.533 --> 01:07:07.761
Yes.

01:07:07.934 --> 01:07:10.698
-The bachelor party was just a fucking ruse?
-Dan, Dan, Dan.

01:07:10.871 --> 01:07:14.034
How many people do you know
who have fucked a midget?

01:07:14.207 --> 01:07:17.370
-You don't think that's awesome?
-Are you fucking kidding me?

01:07:19.079 --> 01:07:23.038
Here you go. Keep it down?
Watch your language.

01:07:24.451 --> 01:07:28.217
I might not have a fiancée anymore
because you dragged me into a lie...

01:07:28.388 --> 01:07:31.118
...that I didn't want
or fucking need to be a part of.

01:07:32.759 --> 01:07:36.126
Now I have to go back to Richmond
and beg her for her forgiveness...

01:07:36.296 --> 01:07:38.560
...and plead with her
not to cancel the wedding...

01:07:38.732 --> 01:07:41.565
...that we have been planning
for two fucking years, Tucker.

01:07:41.735 --> 01:07:44.704
Two fucking years.

01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:49.672
I--

01:07:49.843 --> 01:07:52.073
And what am I gonna do
when I get there, huh?

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.581
Look at my fucking face, man.

01:07:56.950 --> 01:08:01.353
I look like I've been on the wrong end
of a prison beating because I fucking have.

01:08:04.791 --> 01:08:05.917
Dude.

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.990
Let me finish my story.
It's not always about you.

01:08:14.234 --> 01:08:16.361
-Dan, Dan, Dan!
-About me?

01:08:16.536 --> 01:08:18.560
-Come on, come on.
-Oh, my God.

01:08:19.506 --> 01:08:20.837
-Jesus.
-Get off of me!

01:08:21.006 --> 01:08:23.066
-Dude. It was a midget.
-Hey, hey, hey!

01:08:23.243 --> 01:08:26.609
Right now, if I were Tucker,
I would shut the fuck up.

01:09:30.176 --> 01:09:33.042
-I will tell you one thing--
-I don't wanna hear it, Mom.

01:09:33.212 --> 01:09:34.578
I don't wanna hear it.

01:09:38.585 --> 01:09:42.282
No good Baptist would be caught dead
drinking to excess...

01:09:42.455 --> 01:09:45.618
...or getting arrested
for causing a ruckus.

01:09:45.792 --> 01:09:48.352
Of course not,
good Baptists don't get caught.

01:09:48.528 --> 01:09:49.551
That's right.

01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:51.492
They just sit in judgment of others...

01:09:51.665 --> 01:09:54.498
...refusing to help them
when they need it the most.

01:09:56.536 --> 01:09:58.367
Don't you get smart with me,
young lady.

01:09:58.838 --> 01:10:03.775
It is not my fault that you decided
to fall in love with some...

01:10:06.346 --> 01:10:08.541
-...fair-weather Protestant.
-Oh, my God.

01:10:08.715 --> 01:10:09.807
Ordaining women.

01:10:10.584 --> 01:10:12.677
-And marrying the homosexuals.
-Mother!

01:10:12.852 --> 01:10:14.046
Well, it's true.

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:20.455
A religion with all of the spirituality
and none of the guilt? Ha-ha-ha.

01:10:20.627 --> 01:10:22.026
Oh, please.

01:10:22.195 --> 01:10:23.457
It's not right.

01:10:25.231 --> 01:10:30.100
Well, now, look who the Lord has chosen
to deliver unto this happy home.

01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:32.067
We need to talk.

01:10:32.572 --> 01:10:35.871
-Good gracious, Daniel, your face.
-What happened to you?

01:10:36.042 --> 01:10:38.704
-Babe, I'm sorry.
-Sorry?

01:10:40.914 --> 01:10:43.678
The wedding is ruined. Look at your face!

01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:45.477
Enough, Mom.

01:10:46.186 --> 01:10:48.814
Oh, my-- Well, we have to postpone it.

01:10:48.989 --> 01:10:53.153
I cannot display your wedding photos
in my house. What will people think?

01:10:53.326 --> 01:10:56.022
This isn't about you and your baloney.

01:10:58.164 --> 01:11:01.531
Honey, are you okay?

01:11:02.202 --> 01:11:03.396
Babe.

01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:06.971
God, you just gotta stop letting Tucker
get you into these messes.

01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:08.437
Look, I get it.

01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:11.268
Are you okay?

01:11:12.946 --> 01:11:14.072
I'm fine.

01:11:18.818 --> 01:11:20.217
You better stop laughing.

01:11:20.787 --> 01:11:23.255
-You don't look fine.
-Shut up.

01:11:23.423 --> 01:11:25.015
Baby.

01:11:25.458 --> 01:11:28.757
Gross. We have to go.

01:11:28.928 --> 01:11:31.362
-I'll work you over like I did these guys.
-Oh, yeah?

01:11:31.531 --> 01:11:33.055
I killed them.

01:11:35.902 --> 01:11:39.633
-Dude, what's good for positive thinking?
-Penance.

01:11:39.806 --> 01:11:42.274
Exercise is supposed to be good,
let's play some hoops.

01:11:42.442 --> 01:11:43.466
We have class.

01:11:43.643 --> 01:11:46.703
That place we pay 35 grand a year
to attend between happy hours.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.245
Eh, that place is dumb.

01:11:48.415 --> 01:11:50.110
Have you talked to Dan?

01:11:50.283 --> 01:11:53.081
I tried calling him a bunch of times,
but he didn't pick up.

01:11:53.253 --> 01:11:55.847
What? He's not actually pissed, is he?

01:11:56.022 --> 01:11:58.923
Has your id-driven narcissism
completely stripped you...

01:11:59.092 --> 01:12:01.993
...of the ability to evaluate
the consequences of your actions?

01:12:02.162 --> 01:12:04.722
-Dude, this is not that big of a deal.
-Are you drunk?

01:12:04.898 --> 01:12:08.129
How have you gotten this far in life
without understanding this stuff?

01:12:08.301 --> 01:12:10.895
I'll apologize to him tomorrow
when we get to the hotel.

01:12:11.071 --> 01:12:14.040
That way we can be done
with all this bullshit.

01:12:15.075 --> 01:12:19.512
God truly does protect children and fools,
because you are both, Tucker.

01:12:19.779 --> 01:12:21.770
That guy on the left, he's a vegan.

01:12:21.948 --> 01:12:24.576
-Really?
-Look at those abs, Jesus.

01:12:24.751 --> 01:12:26.275
No meat, just abs.

01:12:27.921 --> 01:12:29.411
Oh, this sounds good. Kick his ass.

01:12:30.957 --> 01:12:32.822
-I'm so tired.
-Ugh.

01:12:33.827 --> 01:12:35.419
Yay.

01:12:39.399 --> 01:12:42.266
It's Tucker. You wanna talk to him?

01:12:47.207 --> 01:12:48.970
Hey, is Dan here?

01:12:54.347 --> 01:12:56.212
Yo, dude.

01:12:56.649 --> 01:12:58.446
Can I come in? Talk?

01:13:00.253 --> 01:13:01.277
I'm coming in.

01:13:02.789 --> 01:13:06.919
Yo, Dan. Dude.

01:13:07.927 --> 01:13:09.224
Sorry.

01:13:22.075 --> 01:13:23.133
Whatever.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.644
Okay.

01:13:37.090 --> 01:13:38.387
All right, what should I do?

01:13:39.092 --> 01:13:41.890
-Apologize sincerely.
-I just did.

01:13:42.796 --> 01:13:45.060
Tucker, what kind of fantasy world
do you live in?

01:13:45.231 --> 01:13:47.722
One word and a guy head nod
isn't a sincere apology.

01:13:47.901 --> 01:13:50.165
What am I supposed to say?
I'm not a mind reader.

01:13:50.336 --> 01:13:53.169
Do you understand
the magnitude of the situation?

01:13:53.339 --> 01:13:55.068
He lied to me for you.

01:13:55.241 --> 01:13:58.506
He landed in jail because you failed
as a friend in every way possible.

01:13:58.678 --> 01:14:02.136
-I didn't make him lie to you.
-He lied because he's your friend, Tucker.

01:14:02.315 --> 01:14:04.943
-To protect you.
-That's stupid, protect me from what?

01:14:05.118 --> 01:14:09.111
From his future wife thinking his best friend
is a selfish, lying son of a bitch.

01:14:10.056 --> 01:14:12.581
Except for you know what?
It's even worse than that.

01:14:12.759 --> 01:14:14.954
Because I always knew you were selfish.

01:14:15.128 --> 01:14:17.528
Now I worry
that you're this destructive force...

01:14:17.697 --> 01:14:20.131
...that I can't trust
to protect the man I love.

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:23.463
-It was a bachelor party.
-Tucker, look at me.

01:14:24.604 --> 01:14:26.629
You don't understand.

01:14:26.806 --> 01:14:30.003
Part of friendship is knowing boundaries.
Do you know what Dan's are?

01:14:30.176 --> 01:14:32.542
-Yeah, of course.
-You do?

01:14:32.712 --> 01:14:33.770
Yeah.

01:14:33.947 --> 01:14:35.437
What? So you just ignored them?

01:14:35.615 --> 01:14:36.741
Pushed right past them?

01:14:36.916 --> 01:14:38.975
He sacrificed
his line in the sand for you...

01:14:39.152 --> 01:14:42.144
...and you couldn't sacrifice
a midget vagina for him.

01:14:44.924 --> 01:14:47.620
And you wonder why you're not welcome
at our wedding.

01:14:52.165 --> 01:14:54.156
I'm not invited?

01:14:55.869 --> 01:14:59.100
No, Tucker, you're not.

01:15:02.609 --> 01:15:05.009
There's no way. What does Dan say?

01:15:05.912 --> 01:15:09.609
You don't get it.
I don't care if you're at our wedding.

01:15:10.817 --> 01:15:13.377
It's Dan who doesn't want you there.

01:15:22.061 --> 01:15:23.926
Fuck it.

01:15:34.374 --> 01:15:36.137
It's Tucker.

01:15:37.243 --> 01:15:39.268
-Thanks.
-Mm-hm.

01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:42.780
-What's up?
-What are you doing, man?

01:15:42.949 --> 01:15:44.746
Nothing. Lara's here.

01:15:44.918 --> 01:15:46.886
Oh, cool, let's all hang out.

01:15:47.053 --> 01:15:49.317
Get some drinks.
We can take the stripper dancing.

01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:52.724
Yeah, no thanks.
We're just gonna stay in tonight.

01:15:52.892 --> 01:15:54.154
We got a long day tomorrow.

01:15:54.327 --> 01:15:57.854
Getting pussy doesn't mean
you need to be a pussy. Let's all hang out.

01:15:58.031 --> 01:16:02.627
Yes, Tucker. Insult us
and insistently reassert your initial demand.

01:16:02.802 --> 01:16:05.566
-That will make the difference.
-What are you talking about?

01:16:05.738 --> 01:16:08.434
You already submarined
one relationship this week.

01:16:08.608 --> 01:16:12.100
I'd like a chance to see if mine can float
before you torpedo it, all right?

01:16:12.278 --> 01:16:13.870
I gotta go.

01:16:29.429 --> 01:16:31.090
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

01:16:32.131 --> 01:16:34.861
I have two cats. A girl and a boy.

01:16:35.034 --> 01:16:38.401
Abigail Lulu Dibiase
and Jersey Lemon Dibiase.

01:16:39.939 --> 01:16:42.100
Why do you own cats?

01:16:42.542 --> 01:16:45.443
Do you enjoy having big boxes of shit
all around your house?

01:16:45.979 --> 01:16:48.880
-I clean the litter boxes every day.
-Wow, God.

01:16:49.048 --> 01:16:51.073
Does it not bother you
how haughty they are?

01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:52.774
They could give a fuck about you.

01:16:52.952 --> 01:16:54.317
Not my cats.

01:16:54.487 --> 01:16:57.251
They're not like regular cats,
they're like dogs.

01:16:58.624 --> 01:17:01.559
Now, see, that is right on cue.
Every cat person says that.

01:17:01.728 --> 01:17:07.098
Now, you know
what's not like a regular cat?

01:17:08.701 --> 01:17:10.362
A fucking dog.

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:16.436
There's no need to thank me.

01:17:19.312 --> 01:17:23.373
The silent, awed adoration
is its own reward.

01:17:33.893 --> 01:17:35.884
What you doing?

01:17:37.063 --> 01:17:38.860
I'm talking to the turtles.

01:17:45.471 --> 01:17:48.599
Are they telling you to kill
that fat girl behind us?

01:17:49.275 --> 01:17:51.869
Because that's what
they're telling me to do.

01:17:56.449 --> 01:17:58.110
What? How can you be mad about that?

01:17:58.284 --> 01:18:01.742
-Fat girls aren't real people.
-How can a man say something like that?

01:18:03.256 --> 01:18:05.952
Well, usually I don't say it.
Usually it's my friend Drew.

01:18:06.125 --> 01:18:11.290
And then I come in, pick up the girl
on the rebound. But he's not here.

01:18:11.464 --> 01:18:13.091
So you're drinking alone?

01:18:13.266 --> 01:18:16.133
That's one of the beginning stages
of alcoholism, you know.

01:18:17.603 --> 01:18:19.730
Oh, I am way past the beginning stages.

01:18:19.906 --> 01:18:22.204
I already hide liquor
and drink alone in the dark.

01:18:22.375 --> 01:18:24.866
-That's sad.
-No, it isn't.

01:18:25.044 --> 01:18:27.239
Think about it.
Drinking is highly underrated.

01:18:27.413 --> 01:18:29.142
What are the detriments to drinking?

01:18:29.315 --> 01:18:30.839
-I don't know.
-You don't know.

01:18:31.017 --> 01:18:33.986
Okay, how about it hurts relationships
with family and friends?

01:18:34.454 --> 01:18:37.116
I don't like my family
and my friends drink as much as me.

01:18:37.290 --> 01:18:39.690
How about it causes
long-term health problems?

01:18:39.859 --> 01:18:42.453
I drive way too fast
to worry about anything long-term.

01:18:42.628 --> 01:18:44.619
Now, it costs money. I'll give you that.

01:18:44.797 --> 01:18:47.493
But I'm gonna spend my money
recklessly anyway.

01:18:47.667 --> 01:18:50.295
Better on alcohol
than on drugs or pornography.

01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:53.200
How about it causes
rude and aberrant behavior?

01:18:53.372 --> 01:18:56.808
I'm an asshole when I'm sober,
drinking actually calms me down.

01:18:56.976 --> 01:19:00.173
Now, think about its benefits.
Makes me invulnerable to criticism.

01:19:00.346 --> 01:19:02.906
Makes ugly people attractive,
boring people interesting.

01:19:03.082 --> 01:19:06.017
It makes hot girls like me.
For my money, the choice is obvious.

01:19:06.185 --> 01:19:07.209
Motherfucker!

01:19:07.386 --> 01:19:10.253
Oh, Mongo got angry! Mongo smash!

01:19:10.423 --> 01:19:12.414
You just totally blew your chance,
you know.

01:19:12.592 --> 01:19:14.355
There you were standing by yourself...

01:19:14.527 --> 01:19:17.325
...when two hot girls
decided to talk to you.

01:19:18.331 --> 01:19:21.027
-What hot girls?
-Us!

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.725
That was gonna be my question too.
What hot girls?

01:19:23.903 --> 01:19:27.498
-God bless your overworked heart.
-Oh, another fat-girl joke.

01:19:27.673 --> 01:19:29.903
That really cuts deep.

01:19:30.076 --> 01:19:35.036
The only way that I could cut you deep
is with a battleaxe and a running start.

01:19:35.815 --> 01:19:39.273
-Yo, yo, did you hear that chick?
-You ever seen Wedding Crashers?

01:19:39.452 --> 01:19:42.080
They look like they're a 10
when they're standing there.

01:19:42.255 --> 01:19:45.952
What do you mean? You can count
that high? Skinny, fat one, zero?

01:19:46.893 --> 01:19:48.793
-Let's go.
-What a dickhead.

01:19:48.961 --> 01:19:51.429
Nice striped shirt, Luigi.

01:19:52.532 --> 01:19:55.865
Hey, Olive Oyl, I can't believe
you picked Bluto over Popeye.

01:19:56.035 --> 01:19:57.093
That's fucked up.

01:19:57.270 --> 01:20:00.899
At least I'm not at the bar
drinking by myself.

01:20:06.379 --> 01:20:08.574
Fuck you, fatty.

01:20:14.587 --> 01:20:17.920
I wanted to go the party, but he didn't call.

01:20:24.430 --> 01:20:27.558
Hey, how's it going?

01:20:34.473 --> 01:20:37.374
-This is beautiful, this ring is beautiful.
-Thanks.

01:20:37.543 --> 01:20:40.341
You married or do you wear that
to keep the douche bags away?

01:20:40.513 --> 01:20:42.640
No, I'm actually married.

01:20:42.815 --> 01:20:47.752
-Then how good is your marriage?
-Good enough to keep me in it.

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:51.788
-Then what are you doing here?
-Girls' night out.

01:20:52.658 --> 01:20:54.888
Come on, isn't that just code for:

01:20:55.061 --> 01:20:58.792
"Hey, let's get drunk
and suck off hot guys in the bathroom? "

01:20:59.298 --> 01:21:01.766
Maybe for the girls you hang out with.

01:21:01.934 --> 01:21:03.697
Are you calling my mom a slut?

01:21:07.473 --> 01:21:09.168
Does she know you talk like that?

01:21:09.342 --> 01:21:12.800
Does your husband know
you flirt with men you meet in bars?

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:24.521
-Does it really fucking matter?
-No, it doesn't.

01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:26.351
You're not gonna invite me in?

01:21:29.462 --> 01:21:32.693
-There's only one toilet.
-There's a sink, isn't there?

01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:40.530
Do you always hit on women
in the bathroom line?

01:21:40.706 --> 01:21:42.105
Nope.

01:21:42.275 --> 01:21:46.041
-Only hot ones I want to sleep with.
-You think I'm hot?

01:21:46.212 --> 01:21:50.649
Baby, you're so hot, if I were dating you,
I'd never leave the house.

01:21:50.816 --> 01:21:54.877
I'd never even leave your vaginal area,
unless I was coming on your face.

01:21:57.023 --> 01:21:59.617
You are a naughty little boy.

01:21:59.792 --> 01:22:02.056
What makes you think
I'm gonna have sex with you?

01:22:02.228 --> 01:22:03.718
Oh, please.

01:22:03.896 --> 01:22:05.158
I'm gonna hit it so hard...

01:22:05.331 --> 01:22:08.425
...whoever pulls me out of you
is gonna become king of England.

01:22:29.221 --> 01:22:31.689
-Excuse us.
-Hello.

01:22:32.058 --> 01:22:35.152
-You're next, Gertrude.
-Shameful.

01:22:46.205 --> 01:22:48.537
Fuck.

01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:06.019
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

01:23:20.673 --> 01:23:22.732
-Ready?
-Wait.

01:23:24.176 --> 01:23:25.473
What the fuck?

01:23:26.112 --> 01:23:27.579
I gotta take a shit.

01:23:27.747 --> 01:23:29.442
No, wait. I gotta go first, okay?

01:23:29.615 --> 01:23:32.083
-What?
-Baby, wait. I'll just be a second.

01:23:32.251 --> 01:23:34.378
Oh, fuck.

01:23:50.836 --> 01:23:52.861
Goddamn.

01:23:54.039 --> 01:23:57.372
-What are you doing in there?
-Nothing.

01:23:57.543 --> 01:24:01.206
It doesn't sound like nothing. Hurry up!

01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:03.575
I'll be right out.

01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:06.343
Turn on the fan.

01:24:08.988 --> 01:24:11.684
Light a match or something.

01:24:11.857 --> 01:24:13.188
Oh, fuck.

01:24:13.359 --> 01:24:16.157
-I'm sorry. Oh, no.
-Some air freshener in around here.

01:24:16.328 --> 01:24:18.489
-I'm not feeling so good.
-You're okay.

01:24:18.664 --> 01:24:19.688
I should go.

01:24:19.865 --> 01:24:21.628
-No, no, no, what?
-I'm going.

01:24:21.801 --> 01:24:23.564
Fuck, what is that smell? Holy shit.

01:24:26.705 --> 01:24:28.468
Fuck! You clogged it.

01:24:29.542 --> 01:24:31.442
You clogged a motherfucking hotel toilet.

01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:35.671
What kind of constipated meth-head bowel
movement does it take to clog a hotel toilet?

01:24:35.848 --> 01:24:37.748
Sorry.

01:24:39.151 --> 01:24:40.846
Hello?

01:24:42.888 --> 01:24:44.719
Oh, fuck.

01:25:06.612 --> 01:25:08.671
Thank you very much. Bathroom?

01:25:08.848 --> 01:25:10.782
-Where's the bathroom?
-In the main lobby.

01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:12.918
Main lobby.

01:25:13.652 --> 01:25:16.348
What lobby is--? Oh, fuck it.

01:25:25.531 --> 01:25:27.795
Fucking shit! Where's the bathroom?

01:25:40.713 --> 01:25:42.738
Which way is the fucking...?

01:25:57.630 --> 01:25:59.154
Oh, no, no, no.

01:25:59.765 --> 01:26:01.096
Fuck.

01:26:02.768 --> 01:26:04.565
Fuck.

01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:06.597
Oh, fuck, no.

01:26:14.179 --> 01:26:16.647
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

01:26:35.868 --> 01:26:37.267
Shit.

01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:23.244
Oh, fuck.

01:27:27.353 --> 01:27:28.650
Fuck!

01:28:28.914 --> 01:28:30.814
I'm sorry.

01:29:03.716 --> 01:29:07.345
God, I hope they serve beer in hell.

01:29:08.253 --> 01:29:09.550
You may kiss the bride.

01:29:18.263 --> 01:29:20.891
And now will you please rise?

01:29:34.113 --> 01:29:35.637
Yep.

01:29:36.715 --> 01:29:38.774
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

01:29:38.951 --> 01:29:41.044
Yep, yep. The biggest one you got.

01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:43.484
Okay, thank you very much.

01:29:45.124 --> 01:29:46.716
Hold it. Hold it. Good.

01:29:46.892 --> 01:29:50.384
This is good. Okay. Can I get you
to move your head a little--?

01:29:52.164 --> 01:29:54.928
This time, all she could do
was talk about her and Dan.

01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:58.558
They couldn't stop looking at each other
and holding hands.

01:29:58.737 --> 01:30:01.399
After that, I knew he was a keeper.

01:30:01.573 --> 01:30:05.134
And I was right. I love you, Kristy.

01:30:18.123 --> 01:30:21.923
Hey, I'm Jeff.
I'm Dan's older brother and his best man.

01:30:22.094 --> 01:30:24.062
Dan and I go way back.

01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:26.959
In fact, I kind of feel like
I've known him in my whole life.

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:32.131
When Dan told he'd met the girl
he was gonna marry...

01:30:32.304 --> 01:30:33.396
...I didn't believe it.

01:30:33.572 --> 01:30:36.700
Only a few short years ago,
he was throwing rocks at girls...

01:30:36.875 --> 01:30:39.776
...and now
he is putting one on her finger.

01:30:40.979 --> 01:30:42.003
Oh, God.

01:30:42.181 --> 01:30:45.082
I have known Kristy
for a few years now...

01:30:45.250 --> 01:30:47.810
...and I couldn't ask
for a better sister-in-law.

01:30:47.986 --> 01:30:51.717
Here is to my little bro and his bride.

01:30:55.227 --> 01:30:57.855
All right, Sling Blade, give me that mike.

01:30:58.030 --> 01:31:01.295
Some of you may not know me.
My name is Tucker Max.

01:31:01.466 --> 01:31:03.696
Dan's my best friend.

01:31:03.869 --> 01:31:09.205
At least he was, until last week when I took
advantage of Dan's kindness and loyalty.

01:31:09.374 --> 01:31:12.810
I forced him into lying to Kristy,
dragged him two hours away...

01:31:12.978 --> 01:31:16.778
...got him abusively drunk, and then
ditched him to sleep with a midget stripper.

01:31:16.949 --> 01:31:19.884
I am the reason that, on the most
important day of Dan's life...

01:31:20.052 --> 01:31:22.885
...Dan's face looks like
a melted Barbie doll's.

01:31:23.222 --> 01:31:24.246
Just wait.

01:31:24.423 --> 01:31:27.722
The worst part is, I didn't know
I was doing anything wrong.

01:31:27.893 --> 01:31:31.556
I was just doing what I've always done,
which is pretty much whatever I want.

01:31:31.730 --> 01:31:34.824
And to be honest,
it's worked out pretty well for me so far.

01:31:35.734 --> 01:31:37.497
Up until about 24 hours ago...

01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:40.536
...when my selfishness
finally caught up with me...

01:31:40.706 --> 01:31:45.006
...and cost me Dan's friendship
and my invitation to this wedding.

01:31:45.878 --> 01:31:50.315
Still, I shrugged it off
and went out last night anyway.

01:31:50.482 --> 01:31:53.815
I'm not gonna bore you,
but the long and short of it is, I got drunk...

01:31:54.319 --> 01:31:56.981
...and ended the night
sprinting across the hotel lobby...

01:31:57.155 --> 01:31:58.816
...uncontrollably shitting my pants.

01:32:02.227 --> 01:32:05.253
Ha-ha. No, really,
I crapped all over the lobby.

01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:07.864
And continuing
with my selfish behavior...

01:32:08.033 --> 01:32:11.867
...I left my mess, went back to my
hotel room and acted like nothing happened.

01:32:12.838 --> 01:32:17.275
The only thing that kept me
from passing out in a pile of my own puke...

01:32:17.442 --> 01:32:19.171
...was all the knocking at the door.

01:32:25.183 --> 01:32:31.679
Staring into her angry, overworked face,
I had a moment of clarity.

01:32:34.226 --> 01:32:37.855
Someone else
always cleans up my mess.

01:32:38.363 --> 01:32:41.196
And for the past few years,
that person has been Dan.

01:32:42.601 --> 01:32:47.300
At 3 in the morning,
down on my knees...

01:32:47.472 --> 01:32:52.876
...literally cleaning up my own shit
for the first time in my adult life...

01:32:53.045 --> 01:32:56.811
...I finally understood
what an amazing person Dan is...

01:32:56.982 --> 01:32:59.473
...and how lucky I am...

01:33:00.619 --> 01:33:05.022
...or was, to call him my friend.

01:33:06.558 --> 01:33:09.925
Dan, Kristy.

01:33:14.733 --> 01:33:17.531
When I came to your hotel room last night
to say I'm sorry...

01:33:17.703 --> 01:33:20.501
...I honestly didn't understand
what I was apologizing for.

01:33:20.672 --> 01:33:24.836
But in the last 24 hours, it's hit me.

01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:29.344
It's hit me
like 10 pounds of slippery shit.

01:33:33.185 --> 01:33:34.846
I've been a terrible friend.

01:33:36.121 --> 01:33:39.249
And even though I probably don't deserve
either of you in my life...

01:33:39.424 --> 01:33:43.121
...I had to come down here and tell you that
and ask for your forgiveness.

01:33:43.295 --> 01:33:46.458
And I hope you will accept
my sincere apology.

01:33:48.667 --> 01:33:50.362
Now....

01:33:51.570 --> 01:33:55.131
I know that this is probably gonna scare
the crap out of most of you...

01:33:55.307 --> 01:33:59.038
...but I hope to have kids someday.

01:33:59.378 --> 01:34:02.870
And I'm sure
that I will only have daughters...

01:34:03.048 --> 01:34:06.381
...and they will all be vicious sluts
who sleep with assholes like me...

01:34:06.551 --> 01:34:09.850
...and throw back it in my face.
But such is karma.

01:34:10.255 --> 01:34:12.746
If one is a boy, though...

01:34:12.924 --> 01:34:16.018
...I would consider myself
a huge success as a father...

01:34:16.194 --> 01:34:19.061
...if he grew up to be half the man
Dan is right now.

01:34:21.666 --> 01:34:23.964
That's so sweet.

01:34:24.503 --> 01:34:25.970
Strippers.

01:34:26.838 --> 01:34:27.964
Dan.

01:34:33.345 --> 01:34:34.642
I never thanked you...

01:34:36.948 --> 01:34:38.575
...never acknowledged you...

01:34:40.118 --> 01:34:43.178
...never even really thought about it.
I just took from you, dude.

01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:49.750
I'm really sorry.

01:35:09.614 --> 01:35:12.549
So for once,
I want to give you something back.

01:35:12.717 --> 01:35:14.651
-No.
-Here we go, follow me.

01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:16.913
Let's go. Get up.

01:35:17.089 --> 01:35:20.650
Wedding's going outside.
You're gonna love it. You're gonna love it.

01:35:23.095 --> 01:35:24.892
You're gonna love it.

01:35:25.063 --> 01:35:28.260
Here we go. Come on, come on.

01:35:39.678 --> 01:35:42.647
Yeah. Yeah.

01:35:45.083 --> 01:35:47.381
Get it. Go get it.

01:36:33.999 --> 01:36:37.799
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:36:38.370 --> 01:36:39.928
All right, it's open.

01:36:58.957 --> 01:36:59.981
Three!

01:37:26.351 --> 01:37:30.185
Tucker, I gotta say,
when you came in here, I almost died.

01:37:30.355 --> 01:37:32.482
I didn't know what you were gonna do.

01:37:32.657 --> 01:37:34.386
That speech was really good.

01:37:34.559 --> 01:37:36.652
Thank you. You guys deserve it.

01:37:37.395 --> 01:37:38.419
Yeah, we did.

01:37:40.265 --> 01:37:41.994
Come here.

01:37:42.167 --> 01:37:43.828
Congratulations.

01:37:44.002 --> 01:37:46.129
-Weddings are gay.
-Thank you.

01:37:46.304 --> 01:37:50.172
-You're welcome.
-I am going to go check on the guests.

01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:04.984
Well, I'm gonna go check on Jack.

01:38:06.057 --> 01:38:07.684
Bye.

01:38:09.127 --> 01:38:12.028
All right, you really fucked a midget?

01:38:17.068 --> 01:38:18.365
Oh, yeah.

01:38:18.536 --> 01:38:22.165
When she's riding you,
can you spin her like a top?

01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:25.741
Dude, I tried, but her vagina's too shallow.
The physics were all wrong.

01:38:26.645 --> 01:38:28.909
-Did you really shit the lobby?
-Oh, yeah.

01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:31.139
Did you really clean it up?

01:38:31.316 --> 01:38:33.978
Well, the janitor did show up
with the mop and the bucket.

01:38:34.152 --> 01:38:37.121
You guys have known me for many years.
What do you think Tucker would do?

01:38:58.310 --> 01:39:01.279
I knew it.
You don't even do your own laundry.

01:39:01.446 --> 01:39:04.108
Un-fucking-believable, bro.
You didn't clean it up.

01:39:04.282 --> 01:39:07.683
You show up at my wedding,
pour out your heart, and it's all bullshit.

01:39:07.852 --> 01:39:08.876
It's not all bullshit.

01:39:09.054 --> 01:39:12.080
I don't need to actually clean up the mess
to learn the lesson.

01:39:12.257 --> 01:39:15.715
I don't even know why
this shocks me anymore.

01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:17.757
Oh, dude.

01:39:22.967 --> 01:39:24.434
I'll be right back.

01:39:26.838 --> 01:39:29.033
Whoa, whoa, whoa, careful.

01:39:30.909 --> 01:39:32.536
Watch your step.

01:39:37.415 --> 01:39:39.406
That's my cousin.
