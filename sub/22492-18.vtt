00:18.910 --> 00:20.810
It's alive!

00:39.230 --> 00:40.959
Now this will only hurt
for a second.

00:41.032 --> 00:41.896
Aaah!

00:44.235 --> 00:46.601
My eye! My eye!

00:48.206 --> 00:49.138
Ow! Ow!

00:49.641 --> 00:52.508
Ow! Ow!

01:07.759 --> 01:10.057
Aaaah!

01:17.635 --> 01:19.899
And that's what will happen
if you flinch.

01:21.406 --> 01:23.874
Oh, no, Arthur, this shot
doesn't go in your arm.

01:23.942 --> 01:25.432
It goes in the tip
of your penis.

01:28.146 --> 01:29.340
Go!

01:30.648 --> 01:32.240
I am not a criminal.

01:32.317 --> 01:34.717
Nice try, Mary Jane.
Now where's the fucking coke?

01:34.786 --> 01:37.050
No coke.
I am a witchdoctor.

01:38.656 --> 01:41.386
Stop it!
Those are mystical items!

01:41.459 --> 01:43.324
More like a mystical
ass scratcher.

01:43.394 --> 01:44.986
No! No!
Do not do that!

01:45.063 --> 01:48.123
You're going to open up
a dimensional rift!

01:49.133 --> 01:51.363
Ben, you're human again!

01:51.436 --> 01:53.768
Ben? Holy crap,
the Haitian was right.

01:53.838 --> 01:56.568
Oh, Ben!
I'm so happy for you.

01:56.641 --> 01:59.838
Oh, and I'm happy, too,
sweet cheeks.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.607
Dr. Doom must be attacking.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.671
Quickly to the fantasticar!

02:10.321 --> 02:12.152
Wow, the Fantastic Four!

02:13.891 --> 02:17.622
All shall kneel
before Dr. Doom.

02:17.695 --> 02:18.821
Aaah!

02:19.831 --> 02:21.958
Curses!
The Fantastic Flamer.

02:22.033 --> 02:23.796
I'm the Human Torch, you ass.

02:27.171 --> 02:28.832
My one weakness! Ugh!

02:31.442 --> 02:33.307
Ugh!

02:33.378 --> 02:35.312
Oh, did I just
hit something?

02:35.380 --> 02:39.009
Oh, guess not.

02:39.083 --> 02:41.017
It sure sounds like
I'm dragging something.

02:41.085 --> 02:42.985
But I didn't see anything.

02:43.054 --> 02:44.988
Hey, Dr. Doom.
Cool!

02:45.056 --> 02:47.286
Give it up, Doom,
you're finished.

02:47.358 --> 02:49.155
Doom shall never
cease his efforts

02:49.227 --> 02:50.558
to destroy you all.

02:50.628 --> 02:53.927
Never!
Doom is invincible!

02:53.998 --> 02:55.192
Uh, wait.

02:55.266 --> 02:58.064
Great Scott!
Ben, what did you do?

02:58.136 --> 03:01.003
He was resisting arrest.

03:01.072 --> 03:03.302
Looks like
a clean kill to me.

03:07.645 --> 03:10.170
You're being
awfully quiet, Sue.

03:12.517 --> 03:13.950
Bitch.

03:14.018 --> 03:17.784
If I'm here, I wonder
where that Ben guy is.

03:19.891 --> 03:20.755
Who is it?

03:20.825 --> 03:23.885
It's clobbering time!

03:23.961 --> 03:25.895
Holy shit!

03:28.399 --> 03:30.264
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah!

03:33.738 --> 03:36.036
Does, uh, Vic look
different to you?

03:37.241 --> 03:38.833
Now who can tell me
a little bit about

03:38.910 --> 03:40.309
the Battle of Hastings?

03:40.378 --> 03:42.312
No, you put your hand down!

03:42.380 --> 03:44.473
I've had enough
of your shit! Damn!

03:44.549 --> 03:46.244
Damn! Damn!

03:46.317 --> 03:48.410
I will kill you,
you little piece of shit!

03:48.486 --> 03:50.886
Do you understand me?

03:52.690 --> 03:54.419
Anyone else?

03:56.160 --> 03:57.320
Oh, yes!

03:58.896 --> 04:01.763
Where the hell am I?
Vibratron to Prime...

04:01.833 --> 04:03.767
the Decepticons
must have captured me.

04:03.835 --> 04:06.235
I don't know where I am,
but I'll increase vibration.

04:12.143 --> 04:13.633
In other forest news,
a local girl

04:13.711 --> 04:15.906
was anally violated
by a bear today.

04:15.980 --> 04:17.572
Well, she ate
them bears' porridge.

04:17.648 --> 04:19.240
You never eat
no bears' porridge.

04:19.317 --> 04:21.308
The victim, 18-year-old
Goldilocks Sanchez,

04:21.386 --> 04:23.820
is currently recuperating
in the anal recovery wing

04:23.888 --> 04:25.480
of the Westbrook
Medical Center.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.490
The accused bear,
34-year-old Papa Bear,

04:27.558 --> 04:29.150
faces serious charges,

04:29.227 --> 04:30.819
but has already signed
a five-year contract

04:30.895 --> 04:32.123
with Vivid Video.

04:32.196 --> 04:33.788
What, are you kidding me?

04:33.865 --> 04:36.231
I've got a bear
anally porking chicks.

04:36.300 --> 04:39.667
<i>I'll sell a billion copies
of Papa Bear Pooper Party.</i>

04:39.737 --> 04:41.705
I mean, thank God
we live in a country

04:41.773 --> 04:44.901
where you can film bears
having sex with humans, huh?

04:46.577 --> 04:48.511
Oh, wait. We don't?

04:48.579 --> 04:50.638
So long assholes!

04:58.222 --> 05:00.247
I made this snow angel
for Grandma

05:00.324 --> 05:02.849
because she is
an angel now.

05:04.362 --> 05:06.523
I hate you, Grandma.

05:09.734 --> 05:11.326
This is your captain speaking.

05:11.402 --> 05:12.300
Well, it was a long flight,

05:12.370 --> 05:14.668
but we're on our final
approach to London.

05:14.739 --> 05:17.071
Now's the last chance
to use those lavatories.

05:18.543 --> 05:20.477
Hmm, they sure are
pissing up a storm.

05:20.545 --> 05:21.807
Can our system
handle that?

05:21.879 --> 05:23.437
Oh, I'm sure it's fine.

05:31.389 --> 05:32.481
Mayday!

05:32.557 --> 05:34.548
We have a frozen pissball
emergency!

05:48.406 --> 05:50.101
So here we are
in the hot sun,

05:50.174 --> 05:51.937
the Queen is dead
in a crater,

05:52.009 --> 05:54.807
and all around, the ground
is soaked with piss.

05:54.879 --> 05:56.847
It's a mystery.

05:59.584 --> 06:01.176
Please enjoy
tonight's performance

06:01.252 --> 06:02.514
<i>of Don't Be Ridiculous</i>

06:02.587 --> 06:04.521
starring perfect strangers
Bronson Pinchot

06:04.589 --> 06:06.386
and rapper
Chris "Ludacris" Bridges.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.021
What's going on, man?

06:11.095 --> 06:12.153
Do you mind
if I sit right here?

06:12.230 --> 06:14.391
Don't be ridiculous.
Thank you, thank you.

06:14.465 --> 06:16.831
Man, it's a lot of fine-looking
hoes out here today,

06:16.901 --> 06:18.835
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah!

06:18.903 --> 06:20.530
Don't be ridiculous.

06:20.605 --> 06:22.266
I'm Ludacris.
- Don't be ridiculous.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.274
Nah, man, I'm serious.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.207
That's my name, man.
It's Ludacris.

06:26.277 --> 06:27.744
Don't be ridiculous.

06:27.812 --> 06:29.404
It's Ludacris.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.811
Don't be ridiculous.

06:30.882 --> 06:33.851
Motherfucker, I am not
to be played with.

06:33.918 --> 06:35.579
Are you hearing me?

06:35.653 --> 06:37.348
I will kill
your family!

06:37.421 --> 06:38.353
Cousin Larry?

06:38.422 --> 06:40.185
You wanna die,
motherfucker?!

06:40.258 --> 06:41.725
Don't be ridiculous.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.453
And I'm not
being ridiculous, bitch!

06:43.528 --> 06:46.326
You wanna see ridiculous?
This is ridiculous!

06:54.872 --> 06:57.306
That shit
was ridiculous.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.104
# Don't be, don't be #

06:59.176 --> 07:01.269
# Ridiculous #

07:02.246 --> 07:05.181
Thank you.
Don't be ridiculous.

07:05.249 --> 07:06.511
Yes, and don't be ridiculous.

07:14.525 --> 07:17.756
Well, my dog is always
barking down that hole.

07:17.828 --> 07:20.228
So I figured there's
gotta be something in there.

07:20.298 --> 07:21.890
Rats, snakes.

07:21.966 --> 07:23.831
Could be any number of
reasons to over bill you,

07:23.901 --> 07:25.368
but not to worry.

07:25.436 --> 07:27.495
I got something that'll
take care of the problem.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.472
Eh, will that kill them all?

07:29.540 --> 07:31.474
Nah, it's so I know
where to throw this.

07:32.476 --> 07:34.842
# Happy, happy day #

07:34.912 --> 07:36.937
# Fraggles say
it's a happy day #

07:37.014 --> 07:38.811
# Happy, happy day #

07:38.883 --> 07:42.011
# Nothing could
go wrong... #

07:46.490 --> 07:48.720
Holy crap!
We gotta get outta here.

07:48.793 --> 07:50.488
Run!

07:53.097 --> 07:55.031
Hurry, hurry!

07:55.099 --> 07:57.727
Aah!

07:58.302 --> 08:00.270
Oh, that's bad.

08:00.338 --> 08:02.499
What are we gonna do?
We have no home.

08:02.573 --> 08:05.007
Hey, hey,
Uncle Traveling Matt has been

08:05.076 --> 08:07.772
sending me postcards from
the outer world for years!

08:07.845 --> 08:11.781
With their guidance, I'll find
us a new Fraggle Rock.

08:11.849 --> 08:13.783
Wait, stop!

08:13.851 --> 08:15.443
What's wrong, Wembley?

08:15.519 --> 08:17.453
I see a terrible
thing coming.

08:17.521 --> 08:20.115
Fire and death.
There's blood everywhere!

08:20.191 --> 08:22.125
Something very bad
is coming.

08:22.193 --> 08:23.854
You know, you gotta work
on the "pre" part

08:23.928 --> 08:25.793
of premonition, douchebag.

08:25.863 --> 08:27.455
In your balls.

08:27.531 --> 08:29.294
Take that.
Yeah, kick the balls!

08:29.367 --> 08:30.959
There you go.

08:31.035 --> 08:32.092
I now have a vagina.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.166
What was that?

08:35.239 --> 08:36.831
Uncle Matt says
they're called

08:36.907 --> 08:39.000
"beep beep,
outta the way, asshole!"

08:39.076 --> 08:41.010
But they're harmless.

08:41.078 --> 08:43.568
Outta the way,
asshole!

09:04.568 --> 09:06.559
Death.

09:06.637 --> 09:08.229
You should have warned us.

09:08.305 --> 09:10.773
I'm sure our troubles
are all in the past.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.968
Oh, it's right behind us!

09:13.044 --> 09:15.171
Go, go! Go, go!

09:23.521 --> 09:25.716
Hey, guys, help.

09:25.790 --> 09:27.724
Please kill me.

09:27.792 --> 09:29.589
Kill me, please.

09:31.595 --> 09:33.062
Wait, wait! Stop!

09:33.130 --> 09:34.392
I changed my mind!

09:34.465 --> 09:36.933
Hang in there.
We're almost done.

09:38.936 --> 09:41.097
I can't go on.
Just leave me.

09:41.172 --> 09:43.106
We need food, Gobo.

09:43.174 --> 09:44.937
We're starving.

09:45.009 --> 09:46.670
I smell radishes.

09:49.980 --> 09:52.813
He was right!
Look at all the radishes.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.748
Hooray!

09:54.819 --> 09:57.754
Eat up!
There's plenty.

09:57.822 --> 09:59.414
We made it!

09:59.490 --> 10:01.981
This is it, gang!
This is our new home!

10:02.059 --> 10:04.892
And now, to start
repopulating.

10:04.962 --> 10:08.659
Wait! I'm getting
another vision.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.394
I see...

10:10.468 --> 10:12.095
see...

10:12.169 --> 10:15.070
that I'm gonna get
my freak on!

10:18.442 --> 10:21.104
What is that?

10:25.382 --> 10:26.679
Oh, no!

10:30.187 --> 10:32.121
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #
