00:02.086 --> 00:05.546
Here's what's happened on Glee if you
live in a cave or just got out of prison.

00:05.631 --> 00:07.632
- Will took over the Glee Club.
At first they were terrible.
- We suck.

00:07.716 --> 00:11.427
But then they got kind of good.
Quinn got pregnant and said
it was Finn's but it was Puck's.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.097
- I'm done with you!
- And Will's wife, Terri,
said she was pregnant.

00:14.181 --> 00:17.183
- But she was just scared
that Will liked Emma.
- I just left my wife.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.018
- And then they kissed.
- I want you to be happy, Finn.

00:19.103 --> 00:21.270
Rachel loves that she and Finn
are the Glee Club's new power couple.

00:21.355 --> 00:24.774
But he seems weird about it. Sue tried
to throw sectionals, but they won anyway.

00:24.858 --> 00:28.319
- Which is pretty exciting.
- This is a travesty
of international proportions.

00:28.404 --> 00:29.946
That's what you missed on Glee.

00:32.658 --> 00:35.118
[School Bell Rings]
[Chattering]

00:39.623 --> 00:43.042
Hey, babe.
Looking good.
Feeling good, Mercedes.

00:43.127 --> 00:45.378
This is amazing. Ever since
Glee Club won sectionals,

00:45.462 --> 00:47.380
everybody looks at us differently.

00:47.506 --> 00:50.007
I wanna be
with you, Rachel.
We're glitterati.

00:50.134 --> 00:53.302
I feel like Lady Gaga.
Get used to it, guys.
We're stars now,

00:53.387 --> 00:55.680
on par with all the jocks
and popular kids.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.724
It's the dawn of a new era
here at McKinley,

00:57.808 --> 00:59.809
and we are gonna rule this school.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.354
Ooh-hoo. Welcome to Loser Town.

01:03.439 --> 01:05.356
Population: You.

01:05.441 --> 01:08.234
But I don't understand. We won sectionals.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.319
I've completely demonstrated
the validity of this program.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.322
Now you're saying we have to place
at regionals or the Glee Club's gone?

01:13.407 --> 01:16.242
Schue, that was the deal
from the beginning.

01:16.326 --> 01:21.122
I still have a bottom line.
Those spotlights in the auditorium
don't run on dreams.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.583
Our electricity consumption
is up two percent.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.085
Besides, it's cold out, Schue,

01:26.170 --> 01:28.921
and the Cheerios can no longer
practice out of doors.

01:29.006 --> 01:31.007
They need the use
of the auditorium as well.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.259
But the Cheerios
don't even have a coach.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.053
[Sue]
Oh, yes, they do.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.473
Hey, buddy,
you get a haircut? Looks awful.

01:38.599 --> 01:42.518
What are you doing here?
I'm just dropping off
a mocha for my maharishi.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.438
I took the liberty
of making it a double whip.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.483
Because after our conciliatory dinner,

01:48.567 --> 01:51.194
I happen to know that there is nothing...

01:51.278 --> 01:53.571
you won't eat whipped cream off of.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.865
[Blowing]

01:57.075 --> 01:59.410
Would've gotten you one, Will,
but I don't like you.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.538
Okay.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.501
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

02:06.585 --> 02:09.545
You suspended her
after she leaked our set list to sectionals.

02:09.630 --> 02:13.758
Yes, and the point
of suspension is reinstatement.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.719
[Pushing Buttons]

02:16.804 --> 02:19.055
[Crowd Cheering]

02:23.936 --> 02:26.103
[Finn's Voice] In some ways,
I'm happy football season's over.

02:26.188 --> 02:31.776
I did set the single-season record for being
sacked, but we only won one game.

02:31.860 --> 02:35.321
So I'm hoping basketball
can be a fresh start.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.703
The fact is, I'm kind of depressed.

02:42.788 --> 02:43.955
Hey!

02:44.039 --> 02:45.414
- Hey, Finn.
- Oh.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.625
I made us
his-and-her relationship calendars.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.710
That way, we always know
what the other is up to,

02:49.795 --> 02:52.088
so you can't say you forgot we had plans
when you miss our dates anymore.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.090
Great. But I'm kind
of allergic to cats, so-

02:54.174 --> 02:56.717
I filled in all of our dates
for the next month.

02:56.802 --> 03:00.012
On the sixth,
we're going to see Phantom
at the Autistic Children's Center.

03:00.097 --> 03:02.557
[Finn] I know I saved Glee Club,
and I guess chicks dig me,

03:02.641 --> 03:06.185
but I guess if I'm being honest,
it's more like I'm not over her.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.396
I'm not breaking up with you.
I'm just saying please stop super-sizing,

03:08.480 --> 03:10.773
'cause I don't dig on fat chicks.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.942
I'm pregnant.
And that's my fault?

03:13.026 --> 03:16.487
- And Rachel— now that we're sort of dating,
- [Chattering, Indistinct]

03:16.572 --> 03:18.781
I have to work so much harder
to pretend to be listening to her.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.284
That sounds great.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.245
Sometimes I wish I could be
more like Coach Tanaka.

03:24.329 --> 03:27.415
He pulled a Jessica Simpson.
You know, lost his fiancée,

03:27.499 --> 03:29.792
gained 40 pounds and stopped showering.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.794
And everyone acts like it's totally normal.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.592
- [Whistle Blows]
- [Buzzer Sounds]

03:37.676 --> 03:40.303
That's my boyfriend!

03:42.097 --> 03:45.641
I'm off my game, and I don't
know how to get back on it.

03:49.688 --> 03:52.189
[School Bell Rings]

03:56.278 --> 04:00.072
There. You no longer confuse me
with your she-male looks.

04:00.157 --> 04:03.159
I'm gonna donate this
to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.703
They can use it to plug
the holes in their trailers.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.998
Sue.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.792
Please tell me how you managed
to pull off getting reinstated.

04:11.877 --> 04:14.795
Well, William, I realized
back in my condo in Boca...

04:14.880 --> 04:17.548
that I had indeed behaved poorly.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.759
Riddled with remorse,
I arranged a dinner...

04:19.843 --> 04:22.720
so Figgins and I could have
a little professional sit-down.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.473
Sue, there's no way
I'm letting you back into that school.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.808
Mind flagging down that waiter?

04:29.353 --> 04:33.272
We had a very frank
and healing discussion.
And you know what, Will?

04:33.357 --> 04:38.527
It was like he was seeing me
and my moral integrity
for the very first time.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.489
[Siren Blaring]

04:44.034 --> 04:47.536
So here's what's gonna happen.
As of right now, I am reinstated.

04:47.663 --> 04:52.124
Or I will tell your wife
and the entire congregation
of the Cornerstone Bible Way Church...

04:52.209 --> 04:53.709
of our sexual congress.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.045
It's your choice.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.505
Smile.

04:59.383 --> 05:02.009
- Oh, God!
- Okay, look, Sue.

05:02.094 --> 05:04.095
If you’re back, let's bury the hatchet.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.972
I won't be burying
any hatchets, William,

05:06.056 --> 05:07.974
unless I happen to get
a clear shot to your groin.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.059
You humiliated me.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.103
You did this to yourself, Sue.

05:12.229 --> 05:15.564
All I did was enjoy
watching it happen.
Yeah, well, enjoy this, William.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.608
Now that I am back
and my position is secured,

05:17.693 --> 05:19.360
I will not stop until you are fired...

05:19.444 --> 05:22.154
and your little Glee Club
is annihilated into oblivion.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.408
Bring it.
Oh, I will bring it,
William.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.159
You know
what else I'm gonna bring?

05:27.244 --> 05:29.537
I'm gonna bring some Asian cookery
to rub your head with.

05:29.621 --> 05:32.957
'Cause right now,
you got enough product
in your hair to season a wok.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.421
[Sighs]

05:44.094 --> 05:45.594
Hello.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.973
- Hello?
- Hello.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.517
- What do you guys say
when you answer the phone?
- "What up?"

05:51.643 --> 05:54.270
"Who this be?"
"No. She's dead.
This is her son."

05:54.354 --> 05:57.898
O-kay. Alexander Graham Bell,
inventor of the telephone,

05:57.983 --> 06:00.609
liked to say "ahoy, ahoy"
when he answered the phone.

06:00.694 --> 06:05.489
It was Edison who decided that "hello"
was a more appropriate greeting.

06:05.574 --> 06:10.286
Look, I am really proud
of what you guys did at sectionals.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.288
But as most of you
have realized by now,

06:12.372 --> 06:14.790
it hasn't made a bit of difference
in your day-to-day at school.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.126
I have a Slushee-stained
training bra to prove it.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.211
The fact is,
we're gonna have to be better,

06:19.296 --> 06:22.214
even more spectacular
at regionals.

06:22.299 --> 06:25.384
It's time for some reinvention,
some new New Directions.

06:25.469 --> 06:29.013
We need a new... hello.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.890
Here's your assignment
for the week.

06:30.974 --> 06:35.644
Come up with a fresh number, but it has
to have "hello" in the song title. All right?

06:37.564 --> 06:39.356
[School Bell Rings]

06:43.695 --> 06:46.405
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.786
This is kind of weird,
isn't it?
Yes.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.788
[Laughs]
Here we are.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.499
We've been in this exact situation
a hundred times.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.877
Only this time,

06:59.961 --> 07:03.506
I could just lean over
and kiss you if I want to.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.343
And I want to.
No. Hold on.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.136
Hold on.
I'm sorry.

07:09.221 --> 07:12.473
I just need to clean up first,
so I'll be right back.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.725
Just hold on.
No, no, no, no.
Hey, Emma.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.727
I don't care. We've kissed before.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.063
Yeah, but you caught me
by a surprise sneak attack that time.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.107
It was like a Pearly White Harbor.

07:21.233 --> 07:25.069
[Chuckles]
I'm sorry. This is a completely
unattractive quality.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.738
You are adorable.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.283
You're right too.

07:31.368 --> 07:34.703
We need to clean up a little
before we charge forward.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.832
Get the monkeys off our backs.
Let's do this right.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.209
We should go on a date.
Okay.

07:40.293 --> 07:45.047
Get to know each other as these new people
not tied down by anyone.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.967
My place. I'll cook.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.302
I didn't know you could cook.

07:50.387 --> 07:53.889
There are so many things
you don't know about me,

07:53.974 --> 07:56.976
and I can't wait
to introduce them all to you.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.354
I'll see you later.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.071
You two should be wetting
yourselves with shame.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.366
Glee Club won sectionals,

08:12.450 --> 08:14.493
and you did nothing to stop it.

08:14.578 --> 08:19.331
If you were samurai and
my letter opener were sharp enough,

08:19.416 --> 08:22.751
I would ask you both right now
to commit seppuku.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.212
In Japanese, this means
ritual belly-slitting.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.798
We were seduced by the glitz
and glamour of showbiz.

08:27.883 --> 08:30.342
Let me drop some knowledge on you.

08:30.427 --> 08:33.012
Ever since Quinn Fabray got knocked up,

08:33.096 --> 08:35.514
I've been in the market
for a new head cheerleader.

08:35.599 --> 08:40.394
If you want the job
and back in my good graces,
you're gonna have to turn around...

08:40.478 --> 08:41.937
and listen up.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.982
You're familiar with a little Glee Clubber
named Rachel Berry.

08:45.066 --> 08:48.861
Rachel's the kind of girl
who wants things too badly.

08:48.945 --> 08:52.698
And what she really wants
is one Finn Hudson.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.409
I want you to go after him.
She'll go crazy.

08:55.493 --> 08:58.037
She won't be able to stand
you're dating him.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.080
Humiliated, shamed,

09:00.165 --> 09:02.416
she'll have no choice
but to leave the group.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.629
And without her,
Schuester won't make it to regionals.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.674
- [School Bell Rings]
- [Will] I know it's been hard
on you since the baby drama.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.386
I get it, and it sucks.
You seem to be
handling it fine.

09:14.471 --> 09:18.641
Well, that's because I realized that I had
to find this new person inside of me,

09:18.725 --> 09:21.477
the one that was okay
with what happened.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.562
I just feel so bad about myself.

09:23.647 --> 09:26.398
Finn, that guy who made
all those bad choices,

09:26.483 --> 09:28.609
who ignored the signs, he's gone.

09:28.693 --> 09:32.696
This new, more experienced,
more interesting guy is here.

09:32.781 --> 09:36.659
And I brought you here to introduce you
to him, help you move forward.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.786
Oh, you mean
like meeting other girls?

09:38.870 --> 09:41.872
Because I think I'm dating Rachel.
At least she sure thinks I am.

09:41.957 --> 09:43.749
No, it's not about meeting
someone else.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.710
It's about being okay just being you.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.754
You're a rock star, Finn.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.714
You're like Jagger, Morrison.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.259
Yeah. Yeah, I like that.
Good.

09:53.343 --> 09:57.638
I want you to meet the new
and improved Finn Hudson...
by singing about it.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.182
Oh, that's why
the band's here.
Yeah.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.226
Pick a song, and they're
ready to back you up.

10:02.310 --> 10:05.604
Well, I like what you said
about me being like Morrison.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.648
And the doors have a "hello" song.

10:07.732 --> 10:11.485
So maybe I could find myself
and do my Glee assignment
at the same time.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.363
All right, man, go to work.

- Mr. Schuester, I'd like to run...

11:58.051 --> 12:00.135
some of my "hello" ideas by you.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.480
You're a really good dancer.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.316
Thanks, but my feet
weren't really moving.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.985
That was the best part.
Oh.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.946
Britt and I were wondering
if you wanted to go out.

12:19.030 --> 12:23.158
On a... date? With which one of you?

12:24.494 --> 12:26.495

[Giggles]

12:46.683 --> 12:48.600
What did they want?

12:48.685 --> 12:50.686
Oh, nothing. Just the time.

12:54.399 --> 12:57.609
I know being my boyfriend
is a challenge.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.487
I'm not Quinn.
I don't look like her. I'm not popular.

13:00.572 --> 13:03.449
And my personality,
though exciting and full of surprises,

13:03.533 --> 13:05.784
isn't exactly low-maintenance, but...

13:08.455 --> 13:11.790
I'll always be honest with you,
painfully so.

13:11.875 --> 13:15.043
And all I ask in return
is that you're just honest with me.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.007
I don't think I wanna be your boyfriend.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.386
What?

13:24.471 --> 13:26.763
Rachel, you're really awesome,

13:26.848 --> 13:29.349
but I think I need to connect
with my inner rock star...

13:29.434 --> 13:32.144
before I can fully commit to one woman.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.022
I need to find out who I am now.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.318
I'll tell you who you are.

13:39.402 --> 13:41.820
You're a scared little boy.

13:41.905 --> 13:45.157
You're afraid of dating me
because you think
it might hurt your reputation,

13:45.241 --> 13:47.451
though, which you'd never admit it,
is very important to you.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.786
You hate what Quinn did to you,
not just because it hurt,

13:49.913 --> 13:52.122
but because it was
so humiliating.
You're freaking me out.

13:52.248 --> 13:55.501
It's like you're
inside my head right now.
I just see you for who you are,

13:55.585 --> 13:57.586
unlike you who can only see me...

13:57.670 --> 14:02.049
as this silly girl who made a fool out of
herself in her first Glee Club rehearsal.

14:02.133 --> 14:04.051
And that's where you lose, Finn,

14:04.135 --> 14:07.137
because if you take
a second look at me,

14:07.222 --> 14:11.391
you'd realize that I'm
the only person in your life
who knows you...

14:11.476 --> 14:14.603
and accepts you for who you are,
no matter what.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.151
[School Bell Rings]

14:21.236 --> 14:23.153
[Finn] Well, obviously,
Hawaiian pizza's the best...

14:23.279 --> 14:25.531
because it's got ham
and pineapple on it.
Mm-hmm.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.533
Right?
Oh, God. Wow.

14:27.659 --> 14:30.160
[Finn] So it's better
than most pizzas.
[Will] All right, guys.

on the first syllable.

- Just me.

37:30.040 --> 37:33.000
- [Sighs]
- Most spots are 2,500 watts.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.461
This one is 10 times brighter.

37:35.545 --> 37:38.005
We have to wear sunscreen on stage,
but it's worth it.

37:38.131 --> 37:42.009
I guess everything
is bigger and brighter here.
[Laughs]

37:43.303 --> 37:45.596
I have to ask you something,

37:45.680 --> 37:47.681
and I need you to tell me the truth,
because if you don't,

37:47.766 --> 37:51.477
there will be consequences—
life-and-death consequences.

37:51.561 --> 37:55.940
Because if I give myself to you
and it turns out that you're just playing me,

37:56.024 --> 37:57.858
I might die.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.861
Not literally, but emotionally.

38:00.946 --> 38:05.199
It'll be the kind of heartbreak that girls
like me hold for the rest of their lives,

38:05.325 --> 38:08.744
like Barbra
in The Way We Were.
[Chuckles] Oh, my God.

38:09.913 --> 38:13.207
What?
You're more of a drama
queen than I am.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.673
Hi. I'm Jesse.

38:20.757 --> 38:22.800
I know who you are.

38:22.884 --> 38:27.554
You know Jesse St. James,
the star of Vocal Adrenaline,
your competition at regionals.

38:27.639 --> 38:30.641
I wanna introduce you to Jesse,

38:30.725 --> 38:33.143
the guy who's nuts about you,

38:33.228 --> 38:35.396
the guy who would never hurt you.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.866
No one can know.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.911
I understand.

39:05.802 --> 39:08.804
- [School Bell Rings]
- Hi.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.806
Hey.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.976
I get home last night,

39:14.060 --> 39:18.731
and it was like some ghost
had laid out this beautiful,
romantic meal for me—

39:18.857 --> 39:22.067
a ghost who wears
your perfume.
I was just in the library.

39:24.237 --> 39:26.363
Page 42.

39:26.448 --> 39:27.906
Okay.

39:27.991 --> 39:32.327
Oh, my- my junior prom.

39:41.921 --> 39:43.922
I wanted to surprise you on Wednesday.

39:44.007 --> 39:49.553
Terri came by and, um, told me
about the prom, about the song.

39:49.637 --> 39:52.681
Emma, I have no feelings
about this night anymore.

39:52.766 --> 39:56.018
- I didn't even remember the song.
- I know, not consciously.

39:57.353 --> 40:00.481
But somewhere inside,
you're still not over her.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.234
We were naive.

40:04.319 --> 40:09.323
I think sometimes we spend
so much time with these kids
that we start acting like them.

40:10.992 --> 40:14.953
You've been in the same relationship
your entire life.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.873
You don't know who you are alone.

40:17.957 --> 40:23.045
I think this song is just the beginning
of you repeating the same patterns.

40:23.129 --> 40:26.715
Terri and I met when I was 15.
I'm a different person now.

40:26.800 --> 40:30.594
How is you compromising
yourself for my crazy...

40:30.678 --> 40:33.388
any different than you doing it for hers?

40:45.068 --> 40:48.362
Well, what do you wanna do?

40:48.446 --> 40:50.989
I think that...

40:52.075 --> 40:54.076
you need to spend some time alone.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.705
I do. I think you need
to get to know yourself.

40:58.790 --> 41:02.084
You haven't been okay
with having your own needs
since you were 15.

41:08.758 --> 41:11.051
You're right.

41:11.136 --> 41:16.014
I guess I'm just not good
at being alone...

41:16.099 --> 41:19.059
and realizing
what my own needs are.

41:21.062 --> 41:24.606
Well, maybe around the time
that you figure out what they are,

41:24.691 --> 41:27.025
maybe I'll be ready to get a little messy.

41:31.364 --> 41:33.365
Can you go now?

41:34.951 --> 41:39.788
I think I need to close the door and cry.
[Laughs, Clears Throat]

42:04.981 --> 42:07.232
[Cries]
[School Bell Rings]

42:08.276 --> 42:10.861
Hey. I ended it with Jesse.

42:10.945 --> 42:13.363
You can spread the word.
I know you know how to do that.

42:13.448 --> 42:15.657
Look, I'm sorry. Uh-

42:15.742 --> 42:19.828
I know this really sucks for you,
but I think it's for the best.

42:19.954 --> 42:24.082
Taking one for the team.
I get it.
No, not just for the team.

42:24.167 --> 42:26.919
For us. You and me.

42:27.003 --> 42:31.381
I've been thinking a lot lately.
I feel like I have all these problems,

42:31.466 --> 42:34.384
you know, with Quinn
and basketball and girls and stuff,

42:34.469 --> 42:37.262
and I've been so overwhelmed
trying to figure them all out.

42:37.347 --> 42:40.432
Then I realized the only thing
I needed to fix was us.

42:42.185 --> 42:47.356
I want us to be together, Rachel,
a real couple.

42:47.440 --> 42:51.318
Look. I even circled some dates
on your crazy calendar.

42:53.071 --> 42:57.616
Is you not being able to talk right now
a good thing or a bad thing?

42:57.742 --> 42:59.785
I can't.
Can't what?

43:00.828 --> 43:03.956
I— I can't be a couple with you.

43:06.125 --> 43:09.002
It's the team.

43:09.087 --> 43:11.797
We— We can't have
any, um, drama right now.

43:11.881 --> 43:15.259
You know, we need—
we need to focus on regionals.

43:15.343 --> 43:17.678
And I appreciate your offer,

43:17.762 --> 43:21.390
but in the spirit
of being a team player,
I have to decline.

43:21.474 --> 43:24.768
Hey, whoa.
[Chuckles]

43:24.852 --> 43:29.898
I'm not just some guy
you met at the music store
that you can just blow off.

43:29.983 --> 43:32.526
I don't give up that easy.

43:35.029 --> 43:37.030
