¶ I don't care about the presents ¶

00:21.628 --> 00:24.974

01:11.750 --> 01:15.009
¶ With a toy on Christmas Day

01:15.042 --> 01:18.259
¶ I just want you for my own

01:18.296 --> 01:21.295

==DIFUNDE LA PALABRA==

02:06.716 --> 02:07.815
Here's my list.

02:07.846 --> 02:10.148
I thought we agreed the "things
did wrong this week" list

02:10.184 --> 02:11.735
- was hurting more than helping.
- My Christmas list.

02:11.763 --> 02:14.130
I heard you were having
a little trouble figuring out

02:14.151 --> 02:14.987
what to get me.

02:15.407 --> 02:16.742
I'm freaking out.
I have no idea

02:16.774 --> 02:17.940
what to get Rachel for Christmas.

02:17.976 --> 02:19.235
When in doubt, go with socks.

02:19.269 --> 02:21.266
- A wok is always good.
- What about soil?

02:21.280 --> 02:22.936
I agree with Artie about the socks.

02:23.541 --> 02:24.292
You see?

02:24.324 --> 02:25.957
This is why I don't have
a high-maintenance girlfriend.

02:26.621 --> 02:28.039
Or any girlfriend, for that matter.

02:30.706 --> 02:31.859
Who told you? Kurt?

02:32.009 --> 02:33.018
- No.
- Yes.

02:33.326 --> 02:35.732
- But I can't afford all this stuff.
- Oh, no, silly. No, no.

02:35.763 --> 02:38.261
I just put 15 things on the
list, and you can pick out five.

02:38.906 --> 02:41.310
Look, in a... in a few weeks,
I'm going to find out if I'm

02:41.343 --> 02:42.806
a finalist for NYADA or not, and,

02:43.184 --> 02:46.456
well, I just... I'd really love
to have a little Yuletide bauble

02:46.471 --> 02:48.064
as a good-luck charm
for my audition.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.545
Spray tan?
Teeth whitening? I mean...

02:49.561 --> 02:51.345
I'm just trying
to make it easier for you.

02:51.397 --> 02:53.533
If you'd like, you can make
a list for me also.

02:53.946 --> 02:56.322
Well, like the song says, "All
I want for Christmas is you."

02:56.453 --> 02:58.506
Aw. All I want for Christmas
is you, too.

02:59.420 --> 03:01.603
And five things on that list.

03:05.928 --> 03:06.770
I love you.

03:10.491 --> 03:13.176
Holy crap, I'm dating Kim Kardashian.

03:15.932 --> 03:18.643
Wheels, Porcelain, Other Gay,

03:19.588 --> 03:22.942
the Yuletide is upon us,
and everyone knows

03:23.049 --> 03:25.021
that Cistmas is a time
for forgiveness,

03:25.153 --> 03:27.811
so I have decided to forgive
you for having no talent

03:27.978 --> 03:30.121
and ruining the American songbook

03:30.405 --> 03:31.607
one mash-up at a time.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.759
I've also forgiven you for forcing me

03:33.772 --> 03:35.831
to run in and promptly lose

03:36.229 --> 03:38.523
an humiliating statewide election.

03:38.544 --> 03:41.589
We... accept your forgiveness?

03:41.604 --> 03:42.993
Now, Christmas isn't just a time

03:43.027 --> 03:45.510
when Jewish kids get
slightly uncomfortable

03:45.545 --> 03:47.708
and dwarves get jobs
as Santa's helpers

03:47.770 --> 03:49.434
in demeaning nonunion commercials

03:49.468 --> 03:51.382
that make them quietly die inside.

03:51.439 --> 03:54.226
No, Christmas is also
a time to give back.

03:54.272 --> 03:56.696
Which is why, this Friday,
I am volunteering

03:56.730 --> 03:58.431
at the Lima Homeless Shelter.

03:58.474 --> 04:00.355
And I thought maybe you and
your fellow glee clubbers

04:00.394 --> 04:04.270
might want to pitch in by
giving the gift of song.

04:04.310 --> 04:07.515
Coach Sylvester, I've heard you
say on several occasions

04:07.639 --> 04:09.619
that you don't believe
in homelessness.

04:09.658 --> 04:11.198
You said you considered
homeless people

04:11.240 --> 04:12.529
urban campers.

04:12.563 --> 04:13.706
Can I be honest with you,

04:13.735 --> 04:15.460
Stumbles, Gelfling,
young Burt Reynolds?

04:17.288 --> 04:21.084
I lost my sister this past year,

04:21.120 --> 04:24.547
and this will be my first
Christmas without her.

04:24.634 --> 04:27.886
And honestly, I'm just trying
to keep myself occupie

04:27.926 --> 04:30.412
I... I made plans
to shoot reindeer

04:30.466 --> 04:32.747
from a helicopter with
Sarah Palin, but she canceled.

04:32.809 --> 04:34.382
Apparently,

04:34.417 --> 04:36.231
Todd gets fussy when she misses

04:36.263 --> 04:37.218
his ballet recitals.

04:39.872 --> 04:40.805
We'd be happy to help.

04:41.008 --> 04:42.808
Oh, that's fantastic.

04:43.064 --> 04:45.105
And now, in the spirit of Christmas,

04:45.544 --> 04:47.038
get the hell out of my office.

04:47.103 --> 04:49.311
We might have spent
r entire decorating budget

04:49.358 --> 04:51.517
for the whole year,
but with something that looks

04:51.551 --> 04:53.487
as absolutely fabulous as this,

04:53.524 --> 04:56.530
I have to say,
brav-ho-ho-ho.

04:58.996 --> 05:01.169
Hey, everybody,
listen up. My man,

05:01.199 --> 05:02.610
Rory Flanagan here,
wants to say a few.

05:02.670 --> 05:03.944
Thanks, Finn Hudson.

05:03.996 --> 05:06.580
So, guys, my mummy
was going to come visit

05:06.628 --> 05:08.907
for the holidays,
but plane tickets are expensive,

05:08.926 --> 05:10.792
so it's my first Christmas
without any family.

05:10.853 --> 05:12.419
I'd like to cheer myself up

05:12.454 --> 05:15.420
by dedicating this song
to them... and to the King.

05:15.438 --> 05:16.773
Jesus?

07:23.267 --> 07:25.690
Gosh, that song was so depressing.

07:25.724 --> 07:27.653
I may actually be dead right now.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.064
I-I think, what Santana
means is, although that...

07:30.095 --> 07:31.577
that was mournfully beautiful,

07:31.579 --> 07:33.890
now that the whole glee club
is back together,

07:33.912 --> 07:36.070
I think that we should focus
on the more joyous

07:36.104 --> 07:38.244
and the pageant aspect
of this holiday season.

07:38.279 --> 07:39.324
Rachel's right.

07:39.359 --> 07:40.685
Last Christmas was super sad.

07:40.719 --> 07:41.829
Kurt was at another school,

07:41.854 --> 07:45.108
Coach Sylvester trashed everything,
and Artie got a pair of magic legs

07:45.170 --> 07:46.174
that broke the next day.

07:46.738 --> 07:48.192
We were the island of misfit toys.

07:48.405 --> 07:49.695
This year is going to be...

07:49.729 --> 07:51.578
This year, it's a whole new
sprig of mistletoe.

07:51.619 --> 07:53.107
Guess who's not getting coal

07:53.131 --> 07:56.039
in their stockings
foonce... us.

07:56.073 --> 07:57.240
Rory, have a seat.

07:57.257 --> 07:59.087
just got off the phone
with Don Borowski,

07:59.127 --> 08:01.455
the local station manager
at Lima's PBS affiliate.

08:01.522 --> 08:03.580
Turns out that their annual broadcast

08:03.599 --> 08:05.587
of the Yule log burning
has been canceled.

08:05.589 --> 08:08.588
The hell? Yeah, they can't afford
the licensing fees anymore.

08:08.600 --> 08:11.393
But thank you,
Scrooges who own that copyright,

08:11.427 --> 08:13.639
because Don came to Sectionals,
he loved what we did

08:13.697 --> 08:15.937
- and he is offering us...
- A Christmas special featuring all of us?

08:15.947 --> 08:17.281
Okay, please say you said yes.

08:17.311 --> 08:19.455
Not only did I say yes,
but when Don said

08:19.492 --> 08:20.962
that they were looking
for a director for the special,

08:21.597 --> 08:22.775
I nominated you, Artie.

08:23.371 --> 08:24.496
- Me?
- Yeah.

08:24.615 --> 08:26.340
<i>He saw West Side Story,
loved your work,</i>

08:26.371 --> 08:27.498
and he wants to take a meeting.

08:27.707 --> 08:28.990
But I...

08:29.024 --> 08:31.660
I swore I would never sell out
and do television.

08:31.662 --> 08:33.807
I'm really going to have
to think about this, Mr. Shue.

08:40.306 --> 08:42.390
I'll have to show you my
locker stacking secrets

08:42.414 --> 08:44.006
so that never happens again.

08:45.606 --> 08:46.400
Is that your family?

08:47.617 --> 08:49.812
The whole Flanagan clan.
It's hard, isn't it?

08:51.250 --> 08:51.948
Being away from them.

08:52.107 --> 08:53.542
It's so hard.

08:54.337 --> 08:55.554
It's harder than I ever imagined.

08:56.511 --> 08:57.302
I know the feeling.

08:57.879 --> 08:59.395
I'm only a few hours
away from my family,

08:59.396 --> 09:00.530
and I miss them like crazy.

09:01.697 --> 09:03.044
What are you going to do
for Christmas this year?

09:03.097 --> 09:05.392
I'm even not sure.
Brittany and her family

09:05.772 --> 09:07.459
are going on a trip
to see a gay Santa.

09:08.023 --> 09:09.259
Something about Santa Fe.

09:09.414 --> 09:11.525
Why don't you spend the
holiday with, uh, my family?

09:12.265 --> 09:14.767
I-I need help staying awake on the
drive, plus, this whole week,

09:15.587 --> 09:16.946
I'll be your Christmas sponsor.

09:17.041 --> 09:19.592
Really show you what the holiday
spirit's about in the USA.

09:19.728 --> 09:20.866
That'd be so awesome, Sam.

09:24.292 --> 09:26.592
I am absolutely delighted

09:26.625 --> 09:28.500
that our channel's Christmas special

09:28.522 --> 09:31.664
is being directed
by a teenage disabled boy.

09:31.685 --> 09:34.218
You're like a modern day Tiny Tim.

09:36.398 --> 09:38.386
Oh. I am sorry.

09:38.443 --> 09:40.513
Tiny Tim could walk.

09:40.531 --> 09:41.673
In the spirit of Christmas, I'm going

09:41.675 --> 09:42.703
to pretend you never said that.

09:42.742 --> 09:44.743
Here's the dealio,
Mr. Borowski.

09:44.777 --> 09:46.789
I have two ironclad demands.

09:46.863 --> 09:49.566
The first one came to me
last night in a dream.

09:54.291 --> 09:55.299
The Wookiee was right.

09:55.333 --> 09:56.931
The best Christmas show of all time is

09:56.965 --> 09:58.591
<i>The Star Wars Holiday Special,
shown only once</i>

09:58.709 --> 10:01.079
in 1978, then locked away
in the Lucasfilm vault

10:01.133 --> 10:02.875
like the precious jewel it is.

10:02.991 --> 10:04.580
Every fanboy in the galaxy knows

10:04.629 --> 10:06.136
it's completely awesome.

10:06.166 --> 10:08.708
<i>Therefore, Star Wars must be
a part of our Christmas special.</i>

10:08.725 --> 10:11.227
And I also want to shoot
it in black and white.

10:11.259 --> 10:12.644
Black and white?

10:12.677 --> 10:15.673
It will be an homage to the
second best special of all time,

10:15.707 --> 10:17.642
the Judy Garland Christmas show.

10:17.677 --> 10:20.951
You know, some s Judy was high
on pills and booze, but...

10:21.350 --> 10:24.113
I say she was high
on excitement and Baby Jesus.

10:24.169 --> 10:26.756
Kid, you can shoot the thing
in 3-D,

10:26.795 --> 10:29.127
starring a flock of pigeons,

10:29.424 --> 10:32.265
as long as you can produce
it for under 800 bucks.

10:32.990 --> 10:34.973
I can do it, sir. I know I can.

10:47.765 --> 10:50.133
¶ It's coming on Christmas

10:50.308 --> 10:52.297
¶ They're cutting down trees

10:52.637 --> 10:54.777
¶ They're putting up reindeer

10:54.790 --> 10:57.574
¶ And singing songs of joy and peace ¶

10:57.608 --> 11:00.318
¶ Oh, I wish I had a river

11:00.383 --> 11:06.628
¶ I could skate away on

11:06.661 --> 11:10.735
¶ I wish I had a river so long

11:10.765 --> 11:13.252
¶ I would teach my feet

11:13.286 --> 11:15.286
¶ To fly

11:20.296 --> 11:23.599
¶ Oh, I wish I had a river

11:23.633 --> 11:29.571
¶ I could skate away on

11:29.598 --> 11:34.990
¶ I made my baby cry

11:46.120 --> 11:48.250
¶ He tried hard to help me

11:48.283 --> 11:50.258
¶ You know, he t me at ease

11:50.284 --> 11:52.679
¶ He loved me so naughty

11:52.711 --> 11:55.543
¶ Made me weak in the knees

11:55.600 --> 11:58.761
¶ Oh, I wish I had a river

11:58.801 --> 12:03.687
¶ I could skate away on.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.863
Yeah.

12:18.865 --> 12:20.370
Rachel, could you come see me?

12:20.418 --> 12:22.022
Yes, Artie, of course.

12:22.034 --> 12:23.490
And if this is about my ears,

12:23.524 --> 12:25.381
I know that they're
a little naked right now,

12:25.412 --> 12:27.582
but that's just because I'm
waiting for something special.

12:27.584 --> 12:29.806
Something that's really
gonna sparkle and, you know,

12:29.840 --> 12:31.826
catch the light.
So what's up?

12:31.860 --> 12:33.349
It's not about your ears,
it's about your song.

12:33.383 --> 12:34.755
It makes me want to kill myself.

12:34.798 --> 12:38.331
I'm sorry, Joni Mitchell is
not depressing, she's emotional.

12:38.365 --> 12:40.519
It doesn't fit my vision
for our Christmas spectacular.

12:40.553 --> 12:42.552
And what is that exactly?

12:42.600 --> 12:46.147
We begin in the Swiss Alps,
in the village of Gstaad,

12:46.175 --> 12:48.815
in the perfely-appointed
living room of Kurt Hummel

12:48.845 --> 12:51.481
and Blaine Anderson's
chic swank chalet.

12:51.483 --> 12:53.483
The tree towering and opulent.

12:53.521 --> 12:55.821
The fireplace draped in garlands.

12:55.886 --> 12:57.445
The stockings bejeweled.

12:57.497 --> 12:58.779
Kurt and Blaine,

12:58.894 --> 13:01.168
the perfect hosts have invited
their friends to drop in

13:01.170 --> 13:03.357
for an evening of Noel
Coward-esque banter

13:03.391 --> 13:05.520
and fun, happy,
cheer-filled songs.

13:05.808 --> 13:08.062
Are you telling me I'm not invited
to Kurt and Blaine's for Christmas?

13:08.353 --> 13:09.585
Not unless you pick a happier song.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.697
The evenins festivities
conclude with Rory,

13:11.728 --> 13:13.293
dressed as the Christmas elf Itchy,

13:13.322 --> 13:14.892
reciting "Frosty
the Snowman."

13:15.043 --> 13:17.336
Start with fun, end with fun.

13:17.603 --> 13:19.425
That's how you do it, kids.

13:19.518 --> 13:21.317
The Frosty story isn't fun.

13:21.487 --> 13:23.275
At the end, he melts and dies.

13:23.309 --> 13:24.526
I'm rebooting Frosty.

13:24.853 --> 13:26.191
In my version, he doesn't melt.

13:26.287 --> 13:27.398
He...

13:27.980 --> 13:30.237
Well, new pages forthcoming.

13:30.802 --> 13:32.663
What's wrong with a story
that's a little sad

13:32.727 --> 13:34.288
or a song that's a little depressing?

13:34.433 --> 13:36.029
I mean, that's part
of Christmas, too, right?

13:36.248 --> 13:37.242
It's the sad things

13:37.291 --> 13:38.861
that make you remember
what's really important.

13:39.225 --> 13:43.141
Sorry, Sam, but the phrase is "Merry
Christmas," not "morose Christmas."

13:43.343 --> 13:44.457
That's the vision.

13:44.662 --> 13:46.005
That's what you have to buy into.

13:46.322 --> 13:48.241
Well, sorry, Artie,
I'm not buying into it.

13:48.584 --> 13:51.918
I'm gonna go downtown, see if I can ring one
of those Salvation Army bells. Come on, Rory.

13:51.978 --> 13:53.278
I'll give you a ride.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.162
I should memorize my part, Sam.

14:08.446 --> 14:09.251
Hey.

14:09.657 --> 14:11.583
Bummer about Artie going all
Scrooge on your song.

14:11.678 --> 14:13.321
I'm getting a song
in that Christmas special.

14:13.355 --> 14:16.075
Christmas is all about giving,
and Artie certainly wouldn't be

14:16.125 --> 14:18.364
in the Christmas spirit if
he didn't let me give my talents

14:18.380 --> 14:19.547
to the people of Western Ohio.

14:19.578 --> 14:21.910
At least, the ones
who don't have cable.

14:21.912 --> 14:24.708
Speaking of giving, don't you
think it would be a shame

14:24.726 --> 14:27.420
for me to sing on television
for the first time without me

14:27.905 --> 14:30.855
sparkling in the glow
of one of your generous gifts?

14:31.438 --> 14:33.630
Oh, you want me to give
you your present early?

14:33.653 --> 14:36.772
I hadn't even thought about
that, but what a sweet idea.

14:36.981 --> 14:38.141
Yeah.
Okay, yeah.

14:38.182 --> 14:38.970
All right.

14:41.215 --> 14:43.511
Okay. Usually it comes
in a box, but...

14:46.683 --> 14:47.616
Okay.

14:50.356 --> 14:51.215
Where's my bling?

14:51.283 --> 14:54.186
Well, that was a little
out of my-my price range,

14:54.213 --> 14:57.349
but-but then I saw this commercial for
these African sow pigs you can adopt.

14:57.367 --> 14:59.553
You pay, like, two bucks a
month to fatten them up for

14:59.571 --> 15:01.809
a whole year, and then they feed
a family for, like, a month.

15:02.509 --> 15:04.019
You gave me a dead pig for Christmas?

15:04.042 --> 15:05.835
No, no, it's not dead yet;
you got to get it fat first.

15:05.836 --> 15:07.142
- I'm a vegan.
- Look, I thought

15:07.160 --> 15:08.205
Christmas was about giving, okay?

15:08.223 --> 15:10.616
Which is why I gave you
a super specific list.

15:10.642 --> 15:14.470
Look... it's very sweet
that you gave me a pig...

15:14.511 --> 15:15.522
It's an African sow pig.

15:15.552 --> 15:17.717
Whatever it is, I...
I appreciate it.

15:17.751 --> 15:20.096
But I made you a list
so that you wouldn't

15:20.112 --> 15:22.084
embarrass yourself like this.

15:22.113 --> 15:24.271
I'm not asking for much.

15:24.311 --> 15:26.191
All I want is what's coming to me.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.117
All I want is my fair share.

15:28.148 --> 15:30.694
Guess I'll give the sow pig
to my mom or something.

15:30.730 --> 15:33.400
That is such a great idea.

15:33.434 --> 15:35.432
It's gonna be the best Chrtmas ever.

15:47.548 --> 15:50.887
¶ He came into my dreams last night ¶

15:50.921 --> 15:54.636
¶ A great, big man in red and white ¶

15:54.676 --> 15:58.647
¶ He told me that it's gonna be ¶

15:58.680 --> 16:02.131
¶ A special year for you and me ¶

16:02.144 --> 16:05.564
¶ Underneath the mistletoe

16:05.600 --> 16:08.834
¶ Hold me tight and kiss me slow ¶

16:08.868 --> 16:12.737
¶ The snow is high, so come inside ¶

16:12.776 --> 16:17.828
¶ I want to hear you say to me

16:17.864 --> 16:23.339
¶ It's a very, very,
merry, merry Christmas ¶

16:23.366 --> 16:24.773
<i>¶ Even better than the one before ¶</i>

16:24.918 --> 16:29.676
¶ Gonna party on
till Santa grants my wishes ¶

16:29.706 --> 16:32.214
<i>¶ Think he's knocking
on my front door ¶</i>

16:32.269 --> 16:35.878
¶ Got my halo on, I know what I want ¶

16:35.932 --> 16:39.885
¶ It's who I'm with

16:39.937 --> 16:45.351
¶ It's an extraordinary
merry Christmas ¶

16:47.474 --> 16:51.339
¶ Won't you meet me
by the tree? ¶

16:51.359 --> 16:54.678
¶ Slip away so secretly

16:54.704 --> 16:58.710
¶ Can't you see
how this could be? ¶

16:58.744 --> 17:01.902
¶ The greatest gift of all

17:01.956 --> 17:06.366
¶ It's a very, very,
merry, merry Christmas ¶

17:06.383 --> 17:09.800
<i>¶ Even better than the one before ¶</i>

17:09.832 --> 17:13.412
¶ Gonna stay with you
till Santa grants my wishes ¶

17:13.470 --> 17:16.388
<i>¶ Think he's knocking
on my front door ¶</i>

17:16.421 --> 17:21.252
¶ Got my halo on, I know what I want ¶

17:21.308 --> 17:23.849
¶ It's who I'm with

17:23.884 --> 17:28.209
¶ It's an extordinary
merry Christmas ¶

17:28.242 --> 17:30.721
<i>¶ Even better than the one before ¶</i>

17:30.739 --> 17:35.279
¶ It's a very, very,
merry, merry Chrtmas ¶

17:35.326 --> 17:38.406
<i>¶ Even better than the one before ¶</i>

17:38.449 --> 17:46.094
¶ It's an extraordinary
merry Christmas. ¶

17:47.997 --> 17:49.761
I bow to you.

17:49.799 --> 17:50.918
Oh, God. Gold.

17:50.954 --> 17:53.630
Gold! That's what
I'm talking about!

17:53.683 --> 17:56.470
I see Cheerios behind you,
kind of a dancing Santa thing.

17:56.511 --> 17:58.006
Just as long as they don't upstage us.

17:58.050 --> 18:00.092
Yeah, as long as they
don't upstage us.

18:01.966 --> 18:03.602
Good.

18:04.386 --> 18:05.641
Look at you do-gooders.

18:05.682 --> 18:07.138
Hard at work.

18:07.185 --> 18:08.976
Coach Sylvester, we're in
the middle of rehearsal.

18:09.019 --> 18:10.520
Yeah, and I think it's great
you're working so hard on

18:10.562 --> 18:11.447
your performance.
And I'll tell you what.

18:11.484 --> 18:12.472
Everyone at the homeless shelter

18:12.528 --> 18:13.821
is really looking forward to the show.

18:13.868 --> 18:15.187
I just wanted to confirm

18:15.189 --> 18:17.208
with you, Artie,
that we're on for Friday night.

18:17.228 --> 18:18.788
Oh, Friday.

18:20.069 --> 18:21.070
It's a no-can-do on Friday.

18:21.104 --> 18:22.128
We're taping our Christmas special

18:22.152 --> 18:23.325
for the Lima PBS.

18:23.621 --> 18:24.657
You told me you were in.

18:24.696 --> 18:26.527
This is a huge opportunity for us.

18:26.761 --> 18:28.292
Can we just do it another night?

18:28.311 --> 18:29.596
Homeless will be homeless for a while.

18:29.761 --> 18:31.277
That's sort of the problem.

18:31.298 --> 18:32.329
I promised them.

18:32.599 --> 18:34.875
You don't want to disappoint
these kids.

18:34.876 --> 18:37.884
Hmm, like your behavior
has disappointed us for years?

18:38.123 --> 18:39.785
Last Christmas, you cut down our tree,

18:39.871 --> 18:41.911
you stole our presents and you made
Becky dress up like a reindeer.

18:41.934 --> 18:43.666
So you're gonna walk away
from people who have nothing?

18:43.816 --> 18:45.724
No, not at all.
We're just gonna distract them

18:45.758 --> 18:47.237
from their plight
and the smell of urine

18:47.238 --> 18:49.934
and make them happy with
our glamorous Christmas cheer.

18:49.950 --> 18:51.163
The homeless don't have TVs.

18:53.519 --> 18:54.777
So you're all agreed on this?

18:57.135 --> 18:57.935
Fine.

18:58.221 --> 18:59.161
Merry Christmas.

19:03.687 --> 19:05.033
Let's take it from the top, guys.

19:05.173 --> 19:07.082
And remember, smile.

22:15.530 --> 22:16.977
Hello.

22:17.011 --> 22:19.992
Well, I guess we're all in
the spirit of the season by now.

22:20.026 --> 22:22.562
Let me apologize for not
introducing myself sooner.

22:22.628 --> 22:24.815
I'm Kurt Hummel,
one of your hosts this evening.

22:27.992 --> 22:29.620
Thank you.

22:29.659 --> 22:32.962
And this is my, um...
best friend

22:32.990 --> 22:34.717
and holiday roommate, Blaine Anderson.

22:36.169 --> 22:37.502
How do you do?

22:37.536 --> 22:39.836
Welcome to our bachelor chalet.

22:39.870 --> 22:41.800
We've also asked a few

22:41.838 --> 22:43.587
of our other special friends to dp by.

22:43.947 --> 22:45.708
But I hope they can make
it over the mountains

22:45.720 --> 22:47.646
and through the woods
in this dreary weather.

22:47.815 --> 22:50.234
Oh, come on, now, Kurt.
You know if they get stuck in the snow,

22:50.265 --> 22:52.208
they can always hitch
a ride on Santa's sleigh.

22:53.648 --> 22:54.573
Oh, you!

22:54.597 --> 22:55.595
Hey, it's true.

22:55.649 --> 22:57.401
Oh!

22:57.495 --> 22:59.521
Oh, I'm terribly sorry for keeping yo

22:59.555 --> 23:01.150
standing outside,
shivering on the porch.

23:01.190 --> 23:03.327
Please, come in.
Please, come in.

23:03.361 --> 23:04.748
Watch your step. Come on now.

23:04.780 --> 23:06.416
Don't be shy.
Please, come, come.

23:06.449 --> 23:08.781
Come right on in.
Make yourself at home.

23:08.830 --> 23:11.294
Blaine, please offer our guests
some holiday libations.

23:11.340 --> 23:13.868
I apologize,
but I must check my bid on

23:13.902 --> 23:16.916
the Elizabeth Taylor Christie's
jewelry auction online.

23:16.962 --> 23:18.965
Kurt.

23:21.897 --> 23:22.921
Oh, no!

23:23.058 --> 23:24.204
Oh, what happened?

23:24.423 --> 23:26.882
Did Mariah outbid you
on that necklace you wanted?

23:29.128 --> 23:30.235
That I could take.

23:30.540 --> 23:32.654
The Internet is down because
of this inclement weather.

23:32.684 --> 23:34.924
I didn't get to put my bid in on time.

23:34.938 --> 23:36.090
Christmas is canceled!

23:38.891 --> 23:40.109
Who could that be?

23:40.150 --> 23:42.815
The door's open.
Come on in.

23:42.870 --> 23:45.343
Oh, sorry, we're late.

23:45.458 --> 23:46.487
Hope there's still eggnog.

23:46.546 --> 23:47.942
For you two, always.

23:47.952 --> 23:49.907
Oh, Kurt, how are you?
You look great.

23:49.941 --> 23:52.269
I love what you've done
with the place.

23:52.295 --> 23:53.421
Just a splash of color.

23:53.455 --> 23:54.583
May me take your sweater? Blaine.

23:54.617 --> 23:55.753
Oh, forgive me.

23:55.787 --> 23:57.617
Everyone, these are
our very good friends,

23:57.644 --> 23:59.588
Rachel Berry, Mercedes Jones.

24:02.487 --> 24:04.618
at's going on, boys?

24:04.642 --> 24:06.006
Well, we're on television.

24:06.051 --> 24:08.343
Oh, television?
Us, too?

24:08.390 --> 24:09.336
Hello.

24:09.396 --> 24:11.222
This is for you, Kurt.

24:11.503 --> 24:12.924
For me?
May I open it?

24:12.942 --> 24:14.037
Oh, I wish you would.

24:16.821 --> 24:19.444
Oh, my dear.
Oh, what is in here?

24:19.682 --> 24:20.668
- Here we go.
- Ooh.

24:21.531 --> 24:23.912
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my dears!

24:24.096 --> 24:25.441
How did you know?

24:26.154 --> 24:27.660
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you can believe it,

24:27.878 --> 24:29.431
from the Elizabeth Taylor auction,

24:29.489 --> 24:31.103
ladies and gentlemen,
it's Miss Taylor's

24:31.104 --> 24:33.075
diamond and emerald necklace
and pendant.

24:33.076 --> 24:33.825
Oh!

24:37.018 --> 24:38.666
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

24:38.667 --> 24:39.635
I cannot believe it.

24:39.791 --> 24:41.369
It is truly a Christmas miracle.

24:41.410 --> 24:43.090
Truly a Christmas knockoff.

24:44.821 --> 24:46.671
Mercedes, don't give
away all of our secrets.

24:47.047 --> 24:48.599
Blaine, this is for you.

24:48.650 --> 24:50.935
Oh, why, thank you so much, Rachel.

24:51.510 --> 24:54.407
It's a bow tie with little
Christmas trees on it.

24:54.440 --> 24:55.768
Oh, would you look at that?

24:55.819 --> 24:57.070
Would you look at that?

24:59.325 --> 25:01.213
And there's a little surprise

25:01.240 --> 25:03.685
under the wrapping paper.

25:03.719 --> 25:06.656
Why, they're candy cane striped
Capri pants.

25:07.727 --> 25:09.200
You know what the best part is?

25:09.234 --> 25:10.735
I actually don't already own a pair.

25:10.747 --> 25:12.707
If you can believe that.

25:13.888 --> 25:16.011
Oh, jewels and short pants

25:16.045 --> 25:17.726
and bow ties and good friends.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.554
Truly, this is an ideal evening.

25:19.588 --> 25:21.882
But, Blaine, you know
what's really needed now.

25:22.046 --> 25:23.376
Oh, I think I do.

25:23.410 --> 25:25.636
Rachel, Mercedes?

25:26.532 --> 25:28.589
Oh, we couldn't possibly.

25:28.599 --> 25:30.393
We're not prepared!

25:30.427 --> 25:31.750
Oh, come now.
The piano's just sitting there,

25:31.802 --> 25:32.973
its ivories waiting to be tickle

25:33.016 --> 25:34.942
Well, there is a little something

25:34.966 --> 25:36.185
that we've been working on.

25:36.223 --> 25:37.396
I'm in if you are.

25:38.435 --> 25:39.866
Well, it is Christmas, after all.

25:39.855 --> 25:41.489
- That's just grand.
- Come on. Let's go.

25:41.867 --> 25:44.600
Oh, Kurt, Mercedes, Blaine,
you know, I've realized

25:44.733 --> 25:46.596
that there's some favorite things

25:46.623 --> 25:49.138
that can't be bought
line or in a store

25:49.139 --> 25:50.338
or even in a catalog.

25:50.588 --> 25:53.492
They're right here
in front of my nose.

25:54.269 --> 25:55.240
For instance...

25:55.603 --> 25:58.732
Raindrops and roses
and whiskers on kittens

25:59.042 --> 26:02.198
¶ Bright copper kettles
and warm woolen mittens ¶

26:02.317 --> 26:06.173
¶ Brown paper packages
tied up with strings ¶

26:06.207 --> 26:09.735
¶ These are a few
of my favorite things ¶

26:11.405 --> 26:15.575
¶ Cream-colored ponies
and crisp apple strudels ¶

26:15.632 --> 26:18.721
¶ Doorbells and sleigh bells
and schnitzel with noodles ¶

26:18.756 --> 26:22.061
¶ Wild geese that fly
with the moon on their wings ¶

26:22.085 --> 26:25.883
¶ These are a few
of my favorite things ¶

26:27.510 --> 26:30.218
¶ Girls in white dresses
with blue satin sashes ¶

26:30.221 --> 26:33.717
¶ Snowflakes that stay
on my nose and eyelashes ¶

26:33.728 --> 26:37.185
¶ Silver white winters
that melt into springs ¶

26:37.219 --> 26:40.847
¶ These are a few
of my favorite things ¶

26:40.881 --> 26:44.280
¶ When the dog bites,
when the bee stings ¶

26:44.333 --> 26:47.113
¶ When I'm feeling sad

26:47.163 --> 26:50.327
¶ I simply remember
my favorite things ¶

26:50.362 --> 26:53.962
¶ And then I don't feel...

26:54.003 --> 26:57.452
¶ So bad

27:00.075 --> 27:02.598
¶

27:08.017 --> 27:11.078
¶ Raindrops on roses
and whiskers on kittens ¶

27:11.096 --> 27:14.417
¶ Bright copper kettles
and warm woolen mittens ¶

27:14.435 --> 27:17.315
¶ Brown paper packages
tied up with strings ¶

27:17.357 --> 27:20.616
¶ These are a few
of my favorite things ¶

27:23.574 --> 27:26.597
¶ Cream-colored ponies
and crisp apple strudels ¶

27:26.614 --> 27:29.765
¶ Doorbells and sleigh bells
and schnitzel with ndles ¶

27:29.791 --> 27:32.914
¶ Wild geese that fly
with the moon on their wings ¶

27:32.948 --> 27:36.446
¶ These are a few
of my favorite things ¶

27:39.326 --> 27:42.418
¶ Girls in white dresses
with blue satin sashes ¶

27:42.420 --> 27:45.959
¶ Snowflakes that stay
on my nose and eyelashes ¶

27:45.978 --> 27:48.800
¶ Silver white winters
that melt into spring ¶

27:48.838 --> 27:52.141
¶ These are a few
of my favorite things ¶

27:52.177 --> 27:55.625
¶ When the dog bites,
when the bee stings ¶

27:55.642 --> 27:58.662
¶ When I'm feeling sad

27:58.697 --> 28:02.149
¶ I simply remember
my favorite things ¶

28:02.192 --> 28:04.984
¶ And then I don't feel...

28:05.019 --> 28:09.192
¶ So bad.

28:21.201 --> 28:25.756
Say, when's Christmas dinner?

28:25.792 --> 28:26.990
Oh, no, you guys!

28:27.017 --> 28:28.659
With all the guests and the songs,

28:28.682 --> 28:30.200
I forgot to turn on the oven.

28:30.230 --> 28:32.051
Kurt!

28:33.551 --> 28:35.049
Oh, great.

28:35.100 --> 28:36.858
Whatever else could go wrong?

28:36.883 --> 28:38.602
I suppose we'll have to find out...

28:38.633 --> 28:42.010
after these messages
from our sponsors.

28:46.049 --> 28:48.674
And then I said to Justin
Timberlake, "That's not eggnog!"

28:51.622 --> 28:54.243
Gee whiz, you guys, it's really
coming down out there.

28:54.407 --> 28:55.544
Blaine is right, you guys.

28:55.837 --> 28:57.603
Global climate change
is no laughing matter.

28:57.767 --> 28:59.657
Our overreliance
on fossil fuels is causing

28:59.677 --> 29:01.265
erratic weather patterns
like this one.

29:02.310 --> 29:03.787
I think these are the end times.

29:06.609 --> 29:08.852
Well, if there's one thing
we can all agree on

29:08.865 --> 29:10.693
is that if it keeps snowing like this,

29:10.802 --> 29:13.023
Santa Claus won't be able
to bring us our presents.

29:14.548 --> 29:17.360
Wait! Did you hear that?

29:17.377 --> 29:18.798
Jingle bells?

29:22.969 --> 29:24.754
Sorry, guys. Just us.

29:26.385 --> 29:28.398
Hello.

29:31.053 --> 29:32.704
Oh! How rude of me.

29:32.730 --> 29:33.934
Ladies and gentlemen,

29:33.970 --> 29:35.771
Finn Hudson and Noah Puckerman!

29:37.405 --> 29:39.042
Ooh!

29:39.063 --> 29:43.482
Say, are you dressed like
Luke Skywalker and Han Solo?

29:43.590 --> 29:46.182
No. That's copyright
infringement.

29:46.216 --> 29:49.151
<i>Any resemblance
to Star Wars characters</i>

29:49.185 --> 29:50.269
is purely coincidental.

29:52.833 --> 29:56.113
Hey, guys, why the long faces?

29:56.175 --> 29:58.447
It's Christmas Eve or something.

29:58.499 --> 29:59.662
We thought we heard Santa Claus,

29:59.701 --> 30:01.062
but with the climate change
and end times,

30:01.086 --> 30:03.752
we just don't think
Santa Claus is coming to town.

30:03.798 --> 30:06.739
Well, that's not what we heard.

30:11.352 --> 30:13.921
¶ Oh, you better watch out

30:13.932 --> 30:16.438
¶ You better not cry

30:16.462 --> 30:20.482
¶ You better not pout,
I'm telling you why ¶

30:20.519 --> 30:24.256
¶ Santa Claus is coming to town ¶

30:24.279 --> 30:28.065
¶ Santa Claus is coming to town ¶

30:28.099 --> 30:31.599
¶ Santa Claus is coming

30:31.611 --> 30:34.773
¶ To town

30:36.327 --> 30:40.413
¶ He's making a list,
he's checking it twice ¶

30:40.447 --> 30:43.746
¶ He'gonna find out
who's naughty or nice ¶

30:43.780 --> 30:48.160
¶ Santa Claus is coming to town ¶

30:48.215 --> 30:51.806
¶ Santa Claus is coming to tow¶

30:51.840 --> 30:55.252
¶ Santa Claus is coming

30:55.286 --> 30:58.290
¶ To town

30:59.511 --> 31:01.345
¶ Oh, you better watch out

31:01.401 --> 31:03.324
¶ You better not cry

31:03.350 --> 31:06.982
¶ You better not pout,
I'm telling you why ¶

31:07.016 --> 31:09.971
¶ Santa Claus is coming to town ¶

31:09.993 --> 31:13.815
¶ Santa Clause is coming to town ¶

31:13.824 --> 31:19.170
¶ Santa Claus is coming to town ¶

31:19.199 --> 31:20.483
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

31:26.836 --> 31:31.037
¶ You'd better watch out,
you'd better not cry ¶

31:31.094 --> 31:34.797
¶ You better not pout,
I'm telling you why ¶

31:34.831 --> 31:37.000
¶ Santa Claus is coming to town ¶

31:37.017 --> 31:38.346
¶ Yeah

31:38.381 --> 31:41.170
¶ Santa Clause is coming to town ¶

31:41.183 --> 31:44.550
¶ Santa Claus is coming to ¶

31:44.609 --> 31:52.482
¶ Santa Claus is coming
to town. ¶

31:59.427 --> 32:01.006
oorbell rings)

32:01.040 --> 32:03.663
Oh, my stars.
More guests?

32:03.697 --> 32:04.872
I hope it's carolers!

32:06.923 --> 32:09.215
¶

32:19.224 --> 32:21.253
¶ "Bah, humbug!"
No, that's too strong ¶

32:21.308 --> 32:23.046
¶ 'Cause it is my favorite holiday ¶

32:23.058 --> 32:25.567
¶ But all this year's been
a busy blur ¶

32:25.592 --> 32:27.686
¶ Don't think
I have the energy to add ¶

32:27.720 --> 32:29.382
¶ To my already mad rush

32:29.407 --> 32:31.889
¶ Just 'cause it's 'tis the season ¶

32:31.900 --> 32:33.602
¶ The perfect gift for me would be ¶

32:33.654 --> 32:36.906
¶ Completions and connections
left from last year ¶

32:36.940 --> 32:40.080
¶ Ski shop,
encounter most interesting ¶

32:40.107 --> 32:42.192
¶ Had his number, but never the time ¶

32:42.226 --> 32:44.040
¶ Most of '81 passed
along those lines ¶

32:44.074 --> 32:45.898
¶ So deck those halls,
trim those trees ¶

32:45.914 --> 32:47.738
¶ Raise up cups of Christmas cheer ¶

32:47.753 --> 32:50.500
¶ I just need to catch my breath ¶

32:50.543 --> 32:52.586
¶ Christmas by myself this year ¶

33:03.133 --> 33:04.939
¶ Merry Christmas, Merry Christs ¶

33:04.970 --> 33:07.251
¶ Couldn't miss this one this year ¶

33:07.278 --> 33:09.524
¶ Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas ¶

33:09.553 --> 33:11.481
¶ Couldn't miss this one this year ¶

33:11.524 --> 33:13.648
¶ Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas ¶

33:13.693 --> 33:15.360
¶ Couldn't miss this one this year ¶

33:15.400 --> 33:17.099
¶ Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas ¶

33:17.110 --> 33:19.903
¶ Couldn't miss
this one this year. ¶

33:23.700 --> 33:25.710
All my Christmas wishes came true.

33:25.748 --> 33:27.495
All except for one.

33:29.157 --> 33:31.463
RACHEL; Oh, my goodness, could it be?

33:31.465 --> 33:32.799
Could it be?

33:32.840 --> 33:35.140
Itchy the Holiday Elf.

33:35.163 --> 33:37.472
We asked our friend Itchy
to stop by and read us

33:37.512 --> 33:39.505
a lighthearted, heartwarming,
upbeat, happy Christmas tale,

33:39.644 --> 33:40.795
"Frosty the Snowman."

33:40.953 --> 33:42.393
Actually, I was going
to read that, but...

33:42.893 --> 33:43.643
I searched my heart,

33:44.419 --> 33:46.030
and I'm going to read one
from a different book.

33:46.266 --> 33:48.386
I think it's something that's
going to remind people

33:48.912 --> 33:50.525
what the true spirit of
Christmas really is.

33:50.958 --> 33:53.286
Are you sure you don't
want to read "Frosty"?

33:53.309 --> 33:55.621
We all really want
to hear "Frosty."

33:56.137 --> 33:57.078
Lights, please.

34:00.953 --> 34:02.732
"And there were in the same country

34:02.931 --> 34:04.851
"shepherds abiding in the field,

34:05.203 --> 34:07.065
"keeping watch over
their flock by night.

34:07.548 --> 34:10.395
"And lo, the angel of
the Lord came upon them,

34:11.228 --> 34:13.425
"and the glory of the
Lord "shone around them.

34:14.666 --> 34:17.179
"And the angel said
unto them, 'Fear not.

34:17.712 --> 34:18.558
"'For behold,

34:19.338 --> 34:20.771
"'I bring ye good tidings

34:20.781 --> 34:23.099
"'of great joy, which
shall be to all people:

34:23.679 --> 34:27.318
"'for unto you is born this day
in the city of David a savior,

34:28.239 --> 34:29.768
"which is Christ the Lord.'

34:30.272 --> 34:34.063
"And suddenly there was
with the angel a multitude

34:34.387 --> 34:37.444
"of the heavenly host,
praising God and saying,

34:38.559 --> 34:40.038
"'Glory to God in the highest,

34:41.038 --> 34:42.646
"'and on earth, peace,

34:43.755 --> 34:45.576
goodwill toward men.'"

35:08.423 --> 35:08.848
What?

35:09.154 --> 35:12.953
Everyone's just been telling me you've been having
a rough year, but you seem pretty od to me.

35:14.124 --> 35:14.893
I'm better.

35:15.614 --> 35:19.069
Think I was just stuck focusing
on everything I didn't have

35:19.103 --> 35:21.879
and none of the stuff that was good.

35:21.914 --> 35:23.441
Stuff in the future.

35:25.130 --> 35:27.993
I'm glad you turned it around.

35:28.046 --> 35:29.850
You deserve good things, Quinn.

35:29.884 --> 35:32.175
I'm trying.

35:32.219 --> 35:33.468
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

35:33.511 --> 35:35.138
Portion control, Bee Sting.

35:35.180 --> 35:36.670
Come on.

35:36.725 --> 35:39.230
Guess you're just not
used to being on this side

35:39.255 --> 35:40.652
of the serving line.

35:40.902 --> 35:43.211
Seriously though, I don't think we
have enough food for everybody.

35:43.401 --> 35:43.893
Yeah.

35:44.635 --> 35:47.506
Economy gets bad, people give less.

35:47.615 --> 35:48.411
Hey!

35:53.409 --> 35:56.565
I know we're late, but we were all
hoping there's still time to help.

35:56.585 --> 35:59.293
We brought the turkey from the
special with all the fixings.

35:59.294 --> 36:00.781
Yeah, it's a prop but it's real.

36:00.782 --> 36:02.616
Why don't you put it
on the table over there, kiddo.

36:03.283 --> 36:04.757
You guys finally me around.

36:04.758 --> 36:06.973
Well, you can thank Rory
for helping us see the light.

36:07.451 --> 36:09.449
I was just following
my Christmas sponsor's lead.

36:11.033 --> 36:12.665
Would it be weird
if I made myself a plate?

36:13.500 --> 36:15.360
We have a song, too.
We were gonna perform it

36:15.361 --> 36:17.064
as our final number
for our Christmas special,

36:17.088 --> 36:19.714
but we lost the final
ten minutes of airtime

36:19.730 --> 36:21.489
when the station reached
a last-second agreement

36:21.490 --> 36:22.293
with those Yule log people.

36:22.294 --> 36:23.645
As long as it's not
"Jingle Bells."

36:23.733 --> 36:27.033
It seems it's the only song our janitor knows
how to play, and I'm bleeding from the ears.

36:27.452 --> 36:28.430
If you'd be so kind.

36:28.848 --> 36:30.398
- Sure.
- Love your "Jingle Bells" though.

36:35.763 --> 36:39.324
¶ It's Christmastime

36:39.355 --> 36:42.994
¶ There's no need to be afraid

36:44.076 --> 36:46.534
¶ At Christmastime

36:46.583 --> 36:51.869
¶ We let in light
and we banish shade ¶

36:51.921 --> 36:56.209
¶ And in our world of plenty

36:56.254 --> 37:01.180
¶ We can spread a smile of joy

37:01.214 --> 37:08.672
¶hrow your arms around
the world at Christmastime ¶

37:08.680 --> 37:11.017
¶ But say a prayer

37:12.814 --> 37:16.181
¶ Pray for the other one

37:16.188 --> 37:20.341
¶ Oh, at Christmastime, it's hard ¶

37:20.363 --> 37:25.035
¶ But when you're having fun

37:25.064 --> 37:29.735
¶ There's a world
outside your window ¶

37:29.796 --> 37:33.404
¶ And it's a world of dread and fear ¶

37:33.453 --> 37:37.970
¶ Where the only water flowing

37:38.001 --> 37:41.892
¶ Is the bitter sting of tears

37:41.921 --> 37:47.046
¶ And the Christmas bells that ring ¶

37:47.050 --> 37:50.210
¶ Are the clanging chimes of doom ¶

37:50.232 --> 37:53.984
¶ Well, tonight thank God it's them ¶

37:54.016 --> 37:57.260
¶ Instead of you

37:59.325 --> 38:04.573
¶ And there w't be snow
in Africa this Christmastime ¶

38:04.618 --> 38:07.828
This Christmastime, no ¶

38:07.895 --> 38:13.065
¶ The greatest gift
they'll get this year is life ¶

38:13.082 --> 38:15.281
¶ Is life

38:15.331 --> 38:17.903
¶ Where nothing ever grows

38:17.915 --> 38:19.540
¶ Nothing ever grows

38:19.574 --> 38:24.420
¶ No rain or rivers flow

38:24.464 --> 38:30.429
¶ Do they know
it's Christmastime at all? ¶

38:30.475 --> 38:32.434
¶ Yeah

38:36.557 --> 38:40.803
¶ Feed the world

38:40.857 --> 38:44.766
¶ Let them know it's Christmastime ¶

38:44.779 --> 38:48.649
¶ Feed the world

38:48.699 --> 38:52.989
¶ Let them know it's Christmastime ¶

38:53.040 --> 38:56.553
¶ Feed the world

38:56.572 --> 39:00.998
¶ Let them know it's Christmastime ¶

39:01.050 --> 39:05.308
¶ Feed the world

39:05.330 --> 39:12.062
¶ Let them know
it's Christmastime again. ¶

39:17.820 --> 39:19.604
Just the guy I was looking for.

39:19.605 --> 39:20.057
Hi.

39:20.509 --> 39:23.141
I wanted you to know
that I named my pig.

39:24.086 --> 39:25.701
The African sow pig?

39:25.728 --> 39:26.762
Yep. Come here.

39:31.297 --> 39:32.632
Her name is Barbra.

39:33.420 --> 39:34.684
After my hero.

39:34.685 --> 39:36.951
I mean, I'm assuming
that she's a girl.

39:37.327 --> 39:39.884
But I just hope that pig Barbra
inspires all of the children

39:39.885 --> 39:42.085
who eat her as much as the
real Barbra inspired me.

39:42.243 --> 39:44.123
So it's a kosher sow pig?

39:44.162 --> 39:44.602
Yeah.

39:45.607 --> 39:49.517
Look, the important thing is, is that I just
want you to know that I'm really sorry.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.780
Okay, I-I love her and I love you, and
that's all that matters to me on Christmas.

39:54.653 --> 39:55.453
Okay?

39:55.653 --> 39:58.090
Well, I-I'm glad
you like the pig...

39:58.091 --> 39:58.639
Barbra.

39:59.173 --> 40:01.700
Barbra.
But, uh, then I realized

40:01.701 --> 40:03.749
that once they kill and eat Barbra,

40:04.574 --> 40:06.401
you're not gonna have anything to
show for this year's Christmas.

40:07.143 --> 40:08.558
So I got you something else.

40:09.608 --> 40:10.608
You ready?

40:10.664 --> 40:11.385
Yes.

40:16.189 --> 40:17.073
It's your own star.

40:18.944 --> 40:20.265
You named a star after me?

40:20.860 --> 40:22.687
Well, no.
I, uh, I thought about that,

40:22.688 --> 40:24.964
but then I named it Finn Hudson.

40:26.452 --> 40:28.579
Because there's already
a star named Rachel Berry.

40:29.170 --> 40:32.380
And she's right here on earth and she's
brighter than any of those stars up there.

40:32.677 --> 40:35.355
So I just wanted to make sure
that whenever she feels lonely,

40:35.356 --> 40:38.396
she can look up in theky,
and no matter where I am,

40:38.512 --> 40:40.112
she can know
that I'm looking down on her.

40:41.599 --> 40:42.854
When it's nighttime.

40:45.647 --> 40:46.855
I love this.

40:47.536 --> 40:48.919
I'm gonna put it up right over here.

40:50.136 --> 40:53.823
And, uh, just in case
it's-it's cloudy

40:54.035 --> 40:58.207
or, uh, the middle of the
daytime or the star explodes

40:58.208 --> 40:59.712
in some massive supernova...

41:02.670 --> 41:04.066
these should shine just as bright.

41:15.255 --> 41:16.676
- It's too much.
- No, no, it's okay.

41:16.677 --> 41:19.507
I-I hawked my letterman jacket
on eBay, so...

41:19.529 --> 41:20.087
No, no.

41:21.151 --> 41:23.480
It's too much wonderful for one girl.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.520
I mean, I get the-the guy
and the stars and...

41:26.557 --> 41:27.516
The pig.

41:29.764 --> 41:32.093
I think it's time
that I start giving back.

41:34.051 --> 41:36.022
Come on.

41:36.056 --> 41:37.045
Let's go get our coats.

41:42.981 --> 41:44.197
These bells make me homesick.

41:45.102 --> 41:46.170
You mean, like church bells and stuff?

41:46.849 --> 41:47.412
No.

41:48.281 --> 41:49.346
My brother Shamus gets
lost all the time,

41:49.379 --> 41:51.478
so my dad made him wear
a bell around his neck

41:51.512 --> 41:52.625
so we could always find him.

41:52.649 --> 41:54.784
Smart.

41:54.822 --> 41:56.156
Merry Christmas.

41:56.190 --> 41:58.327
Sam, I was wondering if maybe

41:58.361 --> 42:01.123
you'd like to be my Valentine's
Day sponsor as well.

42:01.161 --> 42:04.539
I mean, you did such a good
job being a Christmas sponsor,

42:05.123 --> 42:05.789
I figured you'd have no problem

42:05.831 --> 42:07.660
helping me land a snog
or two by February.

42:07.694 --> 42:09.378
Deal. But you have to help me

42:09.427 --> 42:11.015
learn to perfect my Sean Connery.

42:11.049 --> 42:12.804
I'm telling you,
impressions are the best way

42:12.839 --> 42:14.053
to get a chick.

42:15.226 --> 42:16.928
Whoa!

42:16.981 --> 42:18.697
So how's business, guys?

42:19.545 --> 42:20.845
Uh, a little slow.

42:21.056 --> 42:22.270
But the revival house
across the street

42:22.271 --> 42:23.436
<i>is showing It's a Wonderful Life,</i>

42:23.437 --> 42:25.253
so pretty sure we'll clean up
when it gets out.

42:25.612 --> 42:27.619
Well, just in case, we wanted to make

42:27.620 --> 42:29.436
our own little contribution
to the cause.

42:30.393 --> 42:31.605
Sure you want to do this, Rachel?

42:31.744 --> 42:33.871
Yes. I already got
my Christmas present.

42:35.846 --> 42:37.343
All right, guys.

42:37.401 --> 42:39.188
Whoa, did you guys knock off
a liquor store or something?

42:40.486 --> 42:43.437
No, we just finally realized
what really matters.

42:43.471 --> 42:46.069
Yeah, we returned the earrings
that Finn got me for Christmas

42:46.099 --> 42:47.690
and the iPod that I bought him.

42:47.750 --> 42:48.908
We decided we wanted to do

42:48.936 --> 42:50.412
something special this year
for Christmas.

42:50.438 --> 42:54.034
We've got a couple of extra
bells if you want to join in.

42:54.074 --> 42:57.037
We'd love to.

43:01.592 --> 43:04.209
Best Christmas ever.

43:05.932 --> 43:07.071
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

43:07.263 --> 43:08.092
Happy Hanukkah.

43:08.933 --> 43:10.178
Happy holidays.

43:10.207 --> 43:12.181
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
