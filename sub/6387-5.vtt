WEBVTT

00:09.888 --> 00:11.322
Wow.

00:11.355 --> 00:12.823
Killing bad guys is your business,

00:12.857 --> 00:15.192
and business be fucking crackin', yo.

00:15.227 --> 00:17.228
That's right, motherfucker.

00:17.262 --> 00:18.896
Know who that is?

00:18.930 --> 00:20.164
Uh, no.

00:20.198 --> 00:22.767
It looks kinda like
Ryan Seacrest though.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.137
What the fuck you got
against Ryan Seacrest, man?

00:25.171 --> 00:26.239
Nothing in particular.

00:26.273 --> 00:27.741
The guy just bugs the shit outta me.

00:27.775 --> 00:28.775
Why?

00:28.810 --> 00:29.910
This motherfucker, he works hard,

00:29.944 --> 00:31.079
make millions of dollars,

00:31.113 --> 00:32.180
and he got a fucking catchphrase,

00:32.214 --> 00:33.782
which I don't have, all right?

00:33.816 --> 00:35.050
And you wanna kill him dead?

00:35.084 --> 00:36.285
That's some harsh shit, Moody.

00:36.319 --> 00:37.920
You got too much
negative energy in you.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.521
You need to work
that shit the fuck out.

00:39.556 --> 00:41.290
Well, excuse me.

00:41.323 --> 00:43.927
No, that's fucking Kali's
new boyfriend right there, man.

00:43.962 --> 00:47.398
Oh, she's got
a new boyfriend, does she?

00:47.432 --> 00:48.633
I don't know, man,

00:48.667 --> 00:50.101
but she moved out of my
fucking crib last week,

00:50.135 --> 00:51.769
talking about she ain't comfortable

00:51.804 --> 00:53.438
mixing business and pleasure anymore.

00:53.473 --> 00:54.740
What kinda shit is that, man?

00:54.774 --> 00:57.009
Did she say she was
seeing someone else?

00:57.043 --> 00:58.210
Fuck no.

00:58.244 --> 00:59.945
But I know how that shit goes, man.

00:59.979 --> 01:02.114
I mean, somebody
gotta be tapping that ass,

01:02.148 --> 01:03.683
'cause that ass is too fine

01:03.717 --> 01:05.018
not to be tapped.

01:05.052 --> 01:06.987
And that Mr. Someone
will get his motherfucking dick

01:07.021 --> 01:08.622
shot the fuck off.

01:08.656 --> 01:11.325
Hey, you know,
don't do anything crazy,

01:11.359 --> 01:12.794
Sam you am.

01:12.828 --> 01:16.632
You're mere months away from
becoming an A-list "raptor."

01:16.666 --> 01:18.167
What the fuck is that?

01:18.201 --> 01:19.869
Rapper turned actor.
Get it?

01:19.903 --> 01:21.003
No, I don't get that.

01:21.038 --> 01:22.238
I like it.

01:22.272 --> 01:23.806
Whatever.

01:23.840 --> 01:27.410
Fucking bitch just drives
me crazy, man.

01:27.444 --> 01:29.045
You know what, maybe it's
the case of a nigga

01:29.079 --> 01:30.880
who wants some shit he can't have.

01:30.914 --> 01:31.914
True dat.

01:31.949 --> 01:33.983
This nigga has often

01:34.017 --> 01:36.219
fell prey to that on some occasions.

01:36.253 --> 01:37.920
I'm sorry.

01:37.954 --> 01:39.121
My bad.

01:39.156 --> 01:42.225
I mean, you know,
I'm in the wrong there.

01:42.259 --> 01:43.693
What you doing tonight, man?

01:43.727 --> 01:44.895
- Mmm?
- What you doing tonight?

01:44.929 --> 01:46.430
- Nothing.
- Wrong.

01:46.464 --> 01:47.931
You're rolling with me
on a ride-along.

01:47.966 --> 01:49.500
A ride-along?

01:49.535 --> 01:51.469
Yeah, with the real
Santa Monica P.D.

01:51.504 --> 01:52.904
I gotta get my fucking cop.

01:52.939 --> 01:54.373
Really wanna be authentic,
you know what I mean?

01:54.407 --> 01:55.508
And I need to hit the streets

01:55.542 --> 01:56.910
to get the feel for this shit.

01:56.944 --> 01:58.979
And you need to be taking
some fucking notes, all right?

01:59.013 --> 02:03.651
So be there or be
six feet under, motherfucker.

02:56.444 --> 02:57.511
You gotta go.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.146
I don't gotta do nothing.

02:59.180 --> 03:01.615
Good God, man,
it's a ride-along.

03:01.649 --> 03:02.816
At the absolute worst,

03:02.850 --> 03:04.718
it'll be an absolute fucking blast.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.287
Look, sooner or later
this guy's gonna find

03:07.322 --> 03:08.655
or figure out that I'm fucking

03:08.690 --> 03:10.358
the object
of his gangstery affections,

03:10.392 --> 03:11.993
and when that happens, I'm toast.

03:12.027 --> 03:13.961
Bloody, bullet-ridden toast.

03:13.996 --> 03:15.229
I still think you should go.

03:15.264 --> 03:17.031
And I think you should be
on my side for once.

03:17.065 --> 03:18.666
You should be focused
on protecting my ass,

03:18.700 --> 03:19.800
not just my career.

03:19.834 --> 03:21.935
Your career
is just fine, buddy-boy.

03:21.970 --> 03:23.971
You are the guy that got
<i>Santa Monica Cop</i>

03:24.005 --> 03:25.072
a green light.

03:25.106 --> 03:26.240
Wow.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.374
There's a dubious honor.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.508
Dubious or not,

03:28.543 --> 03:29.743
I got serious interest in you

03:29.777 --> 03:31.344
for a whole bunch of projects.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.079
That's great.
Really?

03:33.113 --> 03:34.680
Well, why am I just
hearing about it now?

03:34.715 --> 03:36.716
Why just as an aside?
What are they?

03:36.750 --> 03:38.217
I don't know.

03:38.251 --> 03:40.353
I got 'em written down
on a buckslip somewhere.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.456
Worst agent ever.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.992
I'll tell you what,
I will go with you.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.660
Keep you out of harm's way.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.863
I will be your human Kevlar.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.098
It's no problem, none at all.

03:52.132 --> 03:55.001
That's just the kind of service
you get for your 10%.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.270
Bullshit, you just wanna
ride in the police car.

03:57.305 --> 03:59.606
Ever since I was a little boy.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.041
You're here, you're queer,
and I'm used to it,

04:01.075 --> 04:02.108
but you're not invited.

04:02.143 --> 04:04.010
But I could be, right?

04:04.044 --> 04:05.245
I could tag along

04:05.279 --> 04:06.813
for the ride-along.

04:06.847 --> 04:10.450
I feel like crushing one
of your testicles right now.

04:10.484 --> 04:13.352
Does that mean I can go?

04:16.123 --> 04:17.322
Fine, let's go, powder.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.826
I hope you get killed
in the line of duty.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.702
This feels unnatural to me,

04:29.736 --> 04:32.038
voluntarily arriving
at a police station.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.406
I like it.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.740
Smells like crime, punishment,

04:34.775 --> 04:36.176
and the urine
of homeless men and women.

04:36.210 --> 04:39.913
Where is that fucking lunatic?

04:39.948 --> 04:41.315
Hands behind your back, motherfucker.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.250
- 'Cause you under arrest.
- What the fuck for?

04:43.284 --> 04:47.187
For jerking off on the job,
Dr. Evil!

04:47.222 --> 04:49.790
What the fuck?

04:49.825 --> 04:51.459
I scared the shit out you.

04:51.493 --> 04:53.227
Hey, hey, do your Runkle imitation

04:53.262 --> 04:55.963
for Runkle himself.
Check it out.

04:58.434 --> 04:59.901
Huh?

04:59.936 --> 05:01.603
I don't see what's
so funny about that.

05:01.637 --> 05:03.104
It's not even realistic.

05:03.139 --> 05:06.108
Did you watch the video?
It was more like this.

05:06.142 --> 05:07.509
Whoo!

05:07.543 --> 05:08.544
That's true.

05:08.578 --> 05:10.412
Commando.

05:10.447 --> 05:11.680
Hey, what the fuck he doing here, man?

05:11.714 --> 05:12.781
I didn't invite him.

05:12.815 --> 05:14.449
Fucker invited himself.
Tell him.

05:14.483 --> 05:16.718
I always wanted to ride in a cop car.

05:16.752 --> 05:18.687
It's a boyhood dream, actually.

05:18.721 --> 05:19.854
Well, keep your mouth shut

05:19.889 --> 05:21.256
and your dick in your pants, a'ight?

05:21.290 --> 05:22.691
A'ight.

05:22.725 --> 05:24.092
- A'ight.
- A'ight.

05:24.127 --> 05:25.994
Shotgun.

05:29.032 --> 05:31.066
♪ Come on, put 'em up, put 'em up ♪

05:31.100 --> 05:32.601
So this is it, boys.

05:32.635 --> 05:35.103
Welcome to the jungle.
Take a whiff.

05:35.138 --> 05:38.207
Sorry, that was me.

05:38.241 --> 05:39.708
Hey, look, I'll be honest with you,

05:39.742 --> 05:41.376
there's not a whole lot
of glamour to the profession.

05:41.411 --> 05:43.111
Are you kidding?
This is fucking awesome.

05:43.145 --> 05:44.579
Can I turn this light on?

05:44.613 --> 05:46.348
- No.
- Can I pull someone over?

05:46.382 --> 05:47.549
And stop touching stuff.

05:47.584 --> 05:48.784
Come on, man, you're like a big baby.

05:48.818 --> 05:50.919
Hey, that's exactly what I always say.

05:50.953 --> 05:52.654
Any available unit in
the vicinity of Pico and 23rd,

05:52.689 --> 05:54.022
possible "B" and "E" in progress.

05:54.057 --> 05:55.724
Ain't you gonna get that, man?

05:55.758 --> 05:57.192
That shit's close by.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.461
Nah, somebody will get it.

05:59.495 --> 06:01.162
Eventually.

06:01.197 --> 06:02.630
Sounds pretty unpleasant.

06:02.665 --> 06:05.033
Besides, I gotta babysit
you bed wetters.

06:05.067 --> 06:08.002
So what's this movie about?

06:08.037 --> 06:10.605
It's about Hollywood's need to recycle

06:10.639 --> 06:15.343
even the lamest ideas
in an effort to maximize...

06:15.377 --> 06:16.344
stuff.

06:16.378 --> 06:17.478
I don't know.
I'm out.

06:17.513 --> 06:18.613
- I got nothing.
- Shut the fuck up, Moody.

06:18.647 --> 06:20.081
You're too cynical, man.

06:20.116 --> 06:21.650
You need to look at the world
through the eyes of a child

06:21.684 --> 06:23.785
like Runkle here.

06:23.819 --> 06:25.254
- Ooh.
- Hey, yo.

06:25.288 --> 06:26.622
It's about a tough kid
who grew up in Compton,

06:26.656 --> 06:28.124
becomes a cop,

06:28.158 --> 06:29.592
gets transferred over to Santa Monica,

06:29.626 --> 06:31.795
and uses his street smarts
to fuck up whitey.

06:31.829 --> 06:34.030
So it's like <i>Beverly Hills Cop.</i>

06:34.065 --> 06:35.299
You are correct, sir.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.667
Everybody keeps saying that shit.

06:36.701 --> 06:38.502
Nah, man, it's based in Santa Monica.

06:38.536 --> 06:39.870
Yeah, it's set in Santa Monica.

06:39.904 --> 06:43.106
Hey, hey, hey,
Mr. Officer, sir,

06:43.141 --> 06:44.841
that guy is clearly
texting while driving.

06:44.876 --> 06:46.009
Let's get him.

06:46.043 --> 06:47.277
Who gives a fuck?

06:47.311 --> 06:49.012
Who doesn't?
I do it all the time.

06:49.046 --> 06:50.346
I'd be a hypocrite
if I pulled somebody over

06:50.380 --> 06:51.480
for that shit.

06:51.514 --> 06:53.248
You imagine getting
pulled over for texting?

06:53.283 --> 06:54.750
Wouldn't that just
chap your fucking hide?

06:54.784 --> 06:56.051
Fuck, man.

06:56.085 --> 06:58.420
What's your take
on drunk driving, officer?

06:58.455 --> 06:59.521
Yeah, that's a good question, right?

06:59.556 --> 07:00.789
Thank you.

07:00.823 --> 07:01.890
That depends really,

07:01.925 --> 07:03.325
mostly on the cut of their jib.

07:03.359 --> 07:06.161
If the guy's a real d-bag,
his ass is mine.

07:06.196 --> 07:07.797
He is going down.

07:07.831 --> 07:09.798
And the same thing for a hot chick.

07:09.833 --> 07:11.133
Down on this.

07:11.168 --> 07:12.735
Oh-ho! All right.

07:12.770 --> 07:14.304
Get a load of bad lieutenant.

07:14.338 --> 07:16.005
Hey, yo, you ever shoot
a motherfucker before?

07:16.040 --> 07:17.474
Just once.

07:17.508 --> 07:19.109
Kind of a sad story, actually.

07:19.143 --> 07:20.310
It was a little kid.

07:20.344 --> 07:21.645
I mean, I thought the kid had a piece.

07:21.679 --> 07:25.416
Turns out it was an iPod Touch.

07:25.450 --> 07:26.650
Bet he was black.
Was he black?

07:26.685 --> 07:27.818
Was he black?

07:27.853 --> 07:28.919
Of course he was black.

07:28.954 --> 07:30.889
Why do you think I shot first?

07:30.923 --> 07:32.557
This nigga, man.

07:32.591 --> 07:33.792
Cop or no cop, man,

07:33.826 --> 07:35.093
he pull this fucking car over,

07:35.128 --> 07:36.862
I'm gonna bitch-smack
that motherfucker.

07:36.897 --> 07:37.897
Church.

07:38.932 --> 07:40.233
Hey, Runks,

07:40.267 --> 07:41.634
get your shit together, man.

07:41.668 --> 07:42.902
Uh, I'm sorry.

07:42.936 --> 07:44.670
I was just--I was thinking
about little Stewie.

07:44.705 --> 07:46.739
He's always playing
with his iPod Touch.

07:46.774 --> 07:47.941
He's got this app on it

07:47.975 --> 07:49.242
that makes it sound
like a gun, you know?

07:49.276 --> 07:50.577
He used to love to point it at Irma

07:50.611 --> 07:52.012
and pretend to shoot her in the head

07:52.046 --> 07:53.146
execution style.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.548
That's adorable.

07:54.582 --> 07:56.149
Jesus, there but for
the grace of God, huh?

07:57.351 --> 07:59.853
I'm just fucking with you morons.

07:59.888 --> 08:01.755
Never pulled my piece out on the job.

08:01.790 --> 08:02.756
Never.

08:02.791 --> 08:04.124
Not once.

08:04.159 --> 08:07.094
Too bad the same can't
be said for Runks, huh?

08:10.832 --> 08:12.733
I don't know.

08:12.768 --> 08:15.736
Hey, hey, hey, who's hungry?

08:23.245 --> 08:25.113
I can't believe this,
we're actually sitting around

08:25.147 --> 08:26.714
watching a cop eat donuts.

08:26.749 --> 08:28.082
I know, it's a cliche,

08:28.116 --> 08:29.750
but they're so fucking
delicious, you know?

08:29.784 --> 08:32.019
Plus donuts got sugar and carbs,

08:32.054 --> 08:33.888
which allows for
a quick burst of energy.

08:33.922 --> 08:35.389
Coffee keeps me awake and alert.

08:35.423 --> 08:38.325
Hot call comes in, I'm fucking ready.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.927
You getting all this, writer?

08:39.961 --> 08:41.260
You need me to talk slower?

08:41.296 --> 08:44.431
It's all right up here.

08:44.466 --> 08:45.599
Fill 'er up, Dotty.

08:45.633 --> 08:47.301
This shit is fucking boring, yo.

08:47.335 --> 08:48.836
If I want to sit around
and eat donuts all night,

08:48.870 --> 08:50.871
I coulda stayed home and
smoked some fucking weed, man.

08:50.906 --> 08:52.273
Hey, you wanted to see what a night

08:52.307 --> 08:53.574
in the life of a cop is like.

08:53.608 --> 08:55.076
This is it.
I drive around.

08:55.110 --> 08:56.811
I try not to get myself killed.

08:56.846 --> 08:58.513
And I feed the pain
that comes from knowing

08:58.547 --> 09:01.549
that I put my life on the line
night after fucking night.

09:01.583 --> 09:04.819
That and the pain of dealing
with a messy divorce.

09:04.853 --> 09:07.154
Banging a fucking fireman.
You believe that shit?

09:07.188 --> 09:09.556
Chick must really have
a thing for guys in uniform.

09:09.591 --> 09:10.758
Yeah, ever since 9/11,

09:10.792 --> 09:13.027
fucking firemen get all the pussy.

09:13.061 --> 09:15.964
Hey, you see that chick right there?

09:15.998 --> 09:17.265
Total pro.

09:17.299 --> 09:18.766
Wow, how can you tell?

09:18.801 --> 09:20.001
Years of experience, my friend.

09:20.035 --> 09:22.137
Hey, hey, how much
you think she charges?

09:22.171 --> 09:24.639
Ah, 25 bucks
will get you some suction.

09:24.673 --> 09:26.541
Gotta wear a rubber though.

09:26.575 --> 09:29.377
50 bucks, she'll let you
throw deli meat at her ass.

09:29.412 --> 09:30.879
75, she'll let you tase her.

09:30.913 --> 09:32.481
Why would anybody want to do that?

09:32.515 --> 09:33.749
People are sick, man.

09:33.783 --> 09:35.050
I'm just telling you
what's on the menu

09:35.084 --> 09:36.218
with these broads.

09:36.252 --> 09:38.720
Hey, Runkle, how much to tase you?

09:38.755 --> 09:40.055
Hey, hey,
Mr. Samurai, sir,

09:40.089 --> 09:42.357
I've actually been tased,
and it is no fun.

09:42.392 --> 09:43.692
- No, it is.
- No fun at all.

09:43.726 --> 09:44.760
It's fun.

09:44.794 --> 09:46.194
That said, I'd probably do it

09:46.229 --> 09:48.063
for a crisp hundy.

09:48.097 --> 09:49.664
Oh, yeah?
All right, I'll throw in.

09:49.699 --> 09:53.167
Each.
Each maybe.

09:53.202 --> 09:54.635
Ah, shit, it's happening!

09:54.670 --> 09:55.670
What's happening?

09:55.704 --> 09:57.104
My heart.
Another fucking episode.

09:57.139 --> 09:58.139
God damn it!

09:58.173 --> 09:59.273
Are you sure?

09:59.307 --> 10:01.742
Yeah, got an intense pain in my chest.

10:01.777 --> 10:03.544
Arms are going all numb.

10:03.578 --> 10:05.079
Something not good
is definitely happening

10:05.113 --> 10:06.113
to my body right now.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.714
I'm stroking out over here.

10:07.749 --> 10:08.949
You guys are gonna have to drive me

10:08.984 --> 10:10.184
to the fucking hospital, okay?

10:10.218 --> 10:11.452
I'm calling my agent, man.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.387
- I'm right here.
- My new agent.

10:13.422 --> 10:15.523
Now let's not be rash.
U.T.K. is a unique agency.

10:15.557 --> 10:17.658
Our ability to package
is unparalleled.

10:17.692 --> 10:18.959
Hey, hang on, I'll take care of this,

10:18.993 --> 10:20.227
then I'll take care of you.

10:20.261 --> 10:22.462
Okay, 911 it is.

10:24.264 --> 10:26.432
Okay, man down!

10:28.501 --> 10:30.969
God damn.

10:31.003 --> 10:32.737
One minute, you're eating a donut,

10:32.772 --> 10:34.339
waxing all poetic.

10:34.373 --> 10:36.074
The next you're stroking
out all over the floor.

10:36.108 --> 10:37.642
That kinda makes you think, huh?

10:37.676 --> 10:40.211
About laying off the donuts, sure.

10:40.245 --> 10:41.446
Think he's gonna be okay?

10:41.480 --> 10:42.847
I don't know,
he seemed pretty tweaked.

10:42.882 --> 10:44.749
I do know that he appreciated
you holding his hand

10:44.784 --> 10:46.652
the entire time though, Runks.

10:46.686 --> 10:48.487
Well, what do you think, Sam?

10:48.522 --> 10:49.622
I think we should add a stroke scene

10:49.656 --> 10:50.723
- to the script, man.
- Stroke scene?

10:50.757 --> 10:52.757
I can pull that shit off no problem.

10:52.759 --> 10:53.726
Oh, yeah.

10:53.760 --> 10:54.894
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:54.928 --> 10:56.362
Nice.

10:56.397 --> 10:58.498
We best be thinking about
getting ourselves a cab, huh?

10:58.532 --> 11:00.199
Oh, wait a minute,
maybe one of your crew guys

11:00.234 --> 11:01.267
can come pick us up?

11:01.302 --> 11:02.402
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, call the midget.

11:02.436 --> 11:03.503
I love that little dude.

11:03.538 --> 11:04.604
That little nappy-headed
nigga, man.

11:04.639 --> 11:06.906
Yeah, Mr. Lowercase "T."

11:06.941 --> 11:08.141
Nah, man.

11:08.176 --> 11:09.509
Oh, no, no, no.

11:09.544 --> 11:10.844
I don't think that's
a very good idea, Sam.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.612
No, we could really get
in a lot of trouble.

11:12.646 --> 11:13.814
For what?

11:13.848 --> 11:15.249
Just gonna take it back
to the police station.

11:15.283 --> 11:16.583
Charlie, it's the right thing to do.

11:16.617 --> 11:17.918
The moral thing, the polite thing.

11:17.952 --> 11:20.487
I just don't wanna get in any trouble.

11:20.521 --> 11:21.655
What's up, <i>Adam-12?</i>

11:21.689 --> 11:22.823
I thought it was
your boyhood fucking dream

11:22.857 --> 11:23.890
to ride in a police car.

11:23.925 --> 11:25.759
And I have fulfilled that dream.

11:25.793 --> 11:29.029
Now it's time we should all
go home and reflect.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.197
Shotgun!

11:31.232 --> 11:33.767
Hey, guys, where you going?

11:33.801 --> 11:35.068
Whe--

11:35.102 --> 11:38.138
You're just gonna
leave me here, is that it?

11:38.172 --> 11:40.140
Yep, it looks like you're just
gonna leave without me.

11:40.174 --> 11:43.543
Okay, okay, I'm coming.
Can I drive, huh?

11:43.577 --> 11:45.210
♪ Can't stop now ♪

11:45.245 --> 11:47.012
♪ hold the chains and the harnesses ♪

11:47.047 --> 11:49.515
♪ get down to lake town,
'cause can't stop now ♪

11:51.250 --> 11:52.951
Could have at least let
me sit in the front.

11:52.985 --> 11:54.319
I called shotgun.

11:54.353 --> 11:55.754
There's nothing to do back here.

11:55.788 --> 11:57.055
Shut the fuck up, Runkle.

11:57.089 --> 11:58.789
You're like a small child
back there, man,

11:58.824 --> 12:00.358
and it's pissing me the fuck off.

12:00.392 --> 12:02.226
Boring.

12:02.260 --> 12:04.996
This motherfucker
driving all fucking slow.

12:05.030 --> 12:06.364
Watch this, watch this.

12:10.236 --> 12:12.537
Pow, motherfucker!

12:12.572 --> 12:14.206
Excuse me,

12:14.241 --> 12:18.211
but, um, I really think we're
playing with fire here now, Sam.

12:18.245 --> 12:19.646
I don't know if you're aware,

12:19.680 --> 12:22.149
but--but Hank has only recently
finished his probation.

12:22.183 --> 12:23.850
So--

12:23.885 --> 12:25.085
For what, being a fucking rapist?

12:25.119 --> 12:27.888
Hey, stop it with all that
rapist shit, okay?

12:27.922 --> 12:29.590
I'm sensitive about that.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.292
Come on, man, I say that
shit with love, man.

12:31.326 --> 12:32.727
That's what I like about you, man.

12:32.761 --> 12:34.763
You're an outlaw, man.
Truth.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.797
- Bong, bong.
- Bong, bong.

12:36.832 --> 12:38.733
I prefer raper...

12:38.768 --> 12:39.801
to rapist.

12:39.835 --> 12:40.968
Oh, shit.

12:41.003 --> 12:43.237
Grab the wheel for me.

12:43.271 --> 12:44.872
Oh!

12:44.907 --> 12:46.240
Yeah.

12:46.274 --> 12:48.842
Yeah, you probably want
to put that on speaker.

12:48.876 --> 12:51.378
- Fine, have it your way.
- Yo, what up, man?

12:51.412 --> 12:52.612
What?

12:52.646 --> 12:54.513
No, singed for nothin'.
Fuck that.

12:54.548 --> 12:55.848
I'll be right there.

12:55.882 --> 12:56.882
Be right where?

12:56.916 --> 12:58.417
My boy saw Kali up in the club

12:58.451 --> 13:00.653
getting cozy with
some clown-ass nigga, man.

13:00.687 --> 13:02.755
Well, we're going back to
the police station first, right?

13:02.789 --> 13:03.890
You're gonna drop us off.

13:03.924 --> 13:05.758
Something tells me no.

13:05.792 --> 13:08.928
Fuck that, you gotta strike
when the iron fist is hot.

13:08.962 --> 13:11.164
Yeah, but what if
something bad goes down?

13:11.198 --> 13:13.099
You don't want any
witnesses around, do you?

13:13.134 --> 13:14.567
No, I do want witnesses, man,

13:14.602 --> 13:16.135
especially some white
motherfuckers, man.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.604
Oh, why, 'cause we're white?

13:17.638 --> 13:18.872
Yeah, 'cause you white, motherfucker.

13:18.906 --> 13:20.374
Cops believe white motherfuckers.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.510
You got my back, right?
Y'all got my back, right?

13:22.544 --> 13:25.380
You'd lie for me, right?

13:25.414 --> 13:26.481
Not if it's against the law.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.916
You lie for a living, motherfucker.

13:28.950 --> 13:30.651
Man's got a point.

Officer, I think
someone's following me.

14:03.287 --> 14:04.654
Feel like I'm in danger.

14:04.688 --> 14:06.422
Get the fuck outta here, streetwalker.

14:06.457 --> 14:08.024
Can't you see we're working, man?

14:08.058 --> 14:09.192
We on a stakeout.

14:09.226 --> 14:10.226
No, that's not nice.

14:10.261 --> 14:11.428
The lady says she's in danger.

14:11.462 --> 14:14.765
You just want a free hummer,
don't you?

14:14.799 --> 14:17.702
Come on inside here, sweetheart.

14:17.736 --> 14:19.237
That's the way you treat a lady.

14:19.271 --> 14:22.073
Thank you.
Ooh, my dogs are barking.

14:22.108 --> 14:24.142
Aww.
How's business tonight?

14:24.177 --> 14:26.479
It's a little slow, actually.

14:26.513 --> 14:27.547
There she is.

14:27.581 --> 14:30.817
All right, all right, what do you say

14:30.851 --> 14:32.519
we just--we leave the car
out of this

14:32.553 --> 14:33.987
and we proceed on foot.

14:34.022 --> 14:35.222
Stop worrying about the God damn car,

14:35.257 --> 14:36.757
you fucking ninny.

14:48.303 --> 14:49.870
Can I do it?

14:49.905 --> 14:51.338
Fuck yeah, go for it.

14:51.373 --> 14:52.806
How come he gets to do it?

14:52.841 --> 14:55.309
'Cause I like him better, man.

14:55.343 --> 14:58.979
That's right, we're pulling
you over, motherfucker.

14:59.014 --> 15:00.180
Pull over to the right.

15:00.215 --> 15:02.282
What are you, stupid?

15:02.317 --> 15:03.717
Your other right, jackass.

15:03.751 --> 15:05.352
There you go.

15:16.697 --> 15:17.997
So what's the move here,

15:18.032 --> 15:20.534
good cop, bad cop, bald cop?

15:20.568 --> 15:22.135
No, how 'bout bad cop, bad cop,

15:22.170 --> 15:24.104
bald cop stays in the fucking car?

15:24.139 --> 15:26.473
Works for me.

15:34.483 --> 15:36.951
That was sweet of you to let me in.

15:36.985 --> 15:39.020
Give me shelter from the storm.

15:39.054 --> 15:40.689
It's nothing.

15:40.723 --> 15:45.461
Who likes to see a lady in danger?

15:45.496 --> 15:47.330
Not this cop.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.399
Lieutenant Charles W. Runkle.

15:49.433 --> 15:50.767
Nice to meet you.

15:50.801 --> 15:54.905
Nice to meet you too, officer.

15:54.939 --> 15:56.140
So you a detective?

15:56.174 --> 15:57.375
Mm-hmm, yep.

15:57.409 --> 15:58.809
I like to take a couple of the rookies

15:58.844 --> 16:00.478
out on a 5-8-7
now and again,

16:00.513 --> 16:02.214
make sure they know their shit.

16:02.248 --> 16:05.016
It's just good old-fashioned
police work.

16:05.050 --> 16:07.552
Well, how 'bout a good
old-fashioned blowjob?

16:07.586 --> 16:09.120
This one's on me,

16:09.154 --> 16:14.925
'cause you're an officer
and a gentleman.

16:17.895 --> 16:19.495
Ohh!

16:19.530 --> 16:21.864
Out of the car, ma'am.

16:21.898 --> 16:25.134
Hank.

16:25.168 --> 16:27.503
License and registration,
motherfucker.

16:27.538 --> 16:29.005
Come on, look alive.

16:29.039 --> 16:30.639
What the fuck?

16:30.674 --> 16:33.275
He's really pissed.
He misses you.

16:33.309 --> 16:34.710
You know, this is why
I moved out of his place,

16:34.744 --> 16:35.844
because he is a fucking psycho.

16:35.878 --> 16:37.345
Yeah, but we got to talk about this,

16:37.380 --> 16:39.014
'cause sooner or later
he's gonna find out about us.

16:39.048 --> 16:40.615
How?
I'm not gonna tell him.

16:40.650 --> 16:41.817
Are you gonna tell him?

16:41.851 --> 16:42.918
No fucking way.

16:42.953 --> 16:44.253
So we don't have a problem.

16:44.287 --> 16:45.621
Yeah.

16:45.656 --> 16:47.223
Now I know where the fuck you live at.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.025
Get out the car.

16:49.059 --> 16:50.793
He's really kind of sweet in a way.

16:50.828 --> 16:53.263
Hank, I know you think
he's all warm and cuddly.

16:53.297 --> 16:54.464
Oh, no, I don't.

16:54.498 --> 16:55.899
I'm just saying watch yourself.

16:55.933 --> 16:57.300
I am watching myself.

16:57.334 --> 17:00.503
I try to get out, but he pulls
me back in with the money.

17:00.537 --> 17:02.805
And, uh, the money.

17:02.839 --> 17:05.808
And--and, oh,
the exceptional weed.

17:05.843 --> 17:08.711
And, wow, you look really hot tonight.

17:08.746 --> 17:11.080
You know, I'm thinking
maybe I should handcuff you

17:11.115 --> 17:14.217
just to be safe.

17:14.251 --> 17:15.652
What was I doing wrong, officer?

17:15.685 --> 17:17.286
You tell me.

17:17.320 --> 17:21.357
Turn around.

17:21.391 --> 17:23.492
- You been drinking?
- No, sir, not at all.

17:23.526 --> 17:25.794
Not at all?
Bullshit.

17:25.828 --> 17:27.963
You was at the club, wasn't you?

17:27.998 --> 17:30.532
Step over there.

17:32.568 --> 17:34.336
Something smell funky to me, nigga.

17:34.370 --> 17:35.504
Smell like pussy.

17:35.538 --> 17:36.838
You been drinking pussy?

17:36.873 --> 17:38.740
- No.
- No what?

17:38.775 --> 17:41.543
No, I haven't
been drinking pussy, officer.

17:41.577 --> 17:43.445
What, this girl pussy ain't
good enough for you to drink?

17:43.479 --> 17:46.482
I'm sure she got
a very drinkable pussy.

17:46.516 --> 17:48.317
We just haven't gotten there yet.

17:48.351 --> 17:49.985
Think you gonna get there?

17:50.019 --> 17:52.354
I think I can close this, yeah.

17:52.389 --> 17:53.555
Think you can close this.

17:53.590 --> 17:55.624
What if she's somebody else's girl?

17:55.658 --> 17:58.927
Then I say that that
someone else in question

17:58.961 --> 18:02.030
isn't doing a good job
making her happy.

18:02.064 --> 18:05.733
Is that what you say, nigga?

18:05.768 --> 18:07.135
Ahh!

18:07.169 --> 18:08.536
Calvin, what the fuck are you doing?

18:08.571 --> 18:10.404
This motherfucker
disrespecting both of us.

18:10.438 --> 18:11.705
Wait, you know this guy?

18:11.740 --> 18:12.873
You want me to call 911

18:12.907 --> 18:14.240
so that you can deal
with the real cops?

18:14.275 --> 18:15.508
Fuck that.

18:15.543 --> 18:16.910
Look, I want you to come home
with me, a'ight?

18:16.944 --> 18:17.944
Forget all this bullshit.

18:17.978 --> 18:19.278
Fuck you.

18:19.313 --> 18:20.946
Wait a second, you ain't a real cop?

18:20.981 --> 18:22.381
Shit, you could have fooled me.

18:22.415 --> 18:24.049
I'm gonna take that
as a compliment, motherfucker.

18:24.084 --> 18:25.918
I ain't gonna apologize
for fucking your legs up.

18:25.952 --> 18:27.119
I know where the fuck you live.

18:27.153 --> 18:28.954
Keep your hands off my bitch.

18:28.988 --> 18:30.322
Wait a second.

18:30.357 --> 18:32.324
Aren't you Samurai Apocalypse?

18:32.359 --> 18:34.627
- Oh, shit.
- No shit.

18:34.661 --> 18:36.329
Oh, shit!

18:36.363 --> 18:39.465
God, you give an exceptional blowjob.

18:39.499 --> 18:42.902
I mean, seriously.

18:42.936 --> 18:45.905
Something to be said
for putting in the time.

18:45.939 --> 18:48.408
Ahh!

18:48.442 --> 18:50.077
Have you read <i>Outliers?</i>

18:50.111 --> 18:52.179
- Mm-mm.
- Malcolm Gladwell.

18:52.213 --> 18:56.217
He claims that the secret
to success in any field

18:56.251 --> 18:57.885
is a simple matter

18:57.920 --> 19:00.421
of practicing a specific task

19:00.456 --> 19:04.625
for, mmm, about 10,000 hours.

19:14.935 --> 19:16.268
What, you wanna suck my dick now?

19:16.303 --> 19:18.270
What?

19:18.305 --> 19:20.072
You want me to take mine out?

19:20.106 --> 19:22.240
Want me to put it in your mouth?

19:22.274 --> 19:24.442
Your dick?

19:42.860 --> 19:44.461
Buck up, buddy-boy.

19:44.495 --> 19:47.063
It doesn't matter.
You didn't know.

19:47.098 --> 19:48.565
It doesn't count.

19:48.599 --> 19:50.133
Did you know?

19:50.168 --> 19:51.502
Of course.
Didn't you know?

19:51.536 --> 19:52.670
Fuck yeah.

19:52.704 --> 19:53.971
Seen the size of that Adam's apple?

19:55.507 --> 19:56.673
Shit, do I look ignorant to you?

19:56.708 --> 19:58.242
No, no, you look like a guy

19:58.276 --> 20:00.211
who could spot a tranny hooker
from a mile away.

20:00.245 --> 20:01.212
Respect.

20:01.246 --> 20:03.247
Motherfucking right, man.

20:03.281 --> 20:06.250
Shit, this bitch Kali got
my fucking heart on fire, man.

20:06.285 --> 20:08.086
Yeah, I know how that feels, brother.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.621
But you know what Sting says.

20:09.655 --> 20:11.123
What does Sting say?

20:11.157 --> 20:12.958
He says that if you love somebody,

20:12.992 --> 20:14.426
you set them free.

20:14.461 --> 20:16.829
- Sting says that?
- Yep, he sure does.

20:16.863 --> 20:18.230
You're fucking with me, man.

20:18.265 --> 20:20.032
No, he says that.
He sings about it.

20:20.067 --> 20:22.535
That saying been around
since the stone ages.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.236
Yeah, well, Sting's the one
who wrote a song about it.

20:24.270 --> 20:26.205
You think I'm dumb, don't you, Moody?

20:26.239 --> 20:27.606
No, I don't.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.541
Then why are you always
fucking condescending to me?

20:29.575 --> 20:31.476
I'm not condescending to you.
I'm relating.

20:31.510 --> 20:33.912
You know I got a fucking
broken heart right now, right?

20:33.946 --> 20:35.113
I do know that.
Yes, I know.

20:35.147 --> 20:36.547
Fucking <i>Jersey Shore</i> ass nigga, man,

20:36.582 --> 20:39.283
sticking his pencil dick
in my sweet pound cake.

20:39.317 --> 20:40.484
Yeah, I relate.

20:40.518 --> 20:41.852
You know, right now
the love of my life

20:41.886 --> 20:44.121
is getting pounded by some
omnisexual chicken hawk.

20:44.155 --> 20:45.756
Doesn't feel good.

20:45.790 --> 20:48.392
Nah.

20:48.426 --> 20:49.760
It could be worse.

20:49.794 --> 20:51.161
Yeah, how?

20:51.196 --> 20:53.564
Coulda just had your dick
drained by a tranny hooker.

20:54.833 --> 20:56.534
True dat.

20:56.569 --> 20:59.772
It's not funny!
Why are you laughing?

20:59.806 --> 21:02.408
Oh, man.

21:06.946 --> 21:08.847
Oh.

21:08.882 --> 21:10.181
Becca, hey, sweetie.

21:10.216 --> 21:11.550
I thought you weren't talking to me.

21:11.584 --> 21:13.418
Shh!

21:13.453 --> 21:14.753
Wait, hold up.

21:14.787 --> 21:16.688
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

21:16.723 --> 21:17.956
It's back?

21:17.991 --> 21:19.291
Okay, I gotta see this.

21:19.326 --> 21:20.726
We'll be there.

21:20.761 --> 21:21.727
What's up?

21:21.762 --> 21:23.396
We got somewhere we gotta go.

21:23.430 --> 21:27.066
Let's go deep.

21:33.808 --> 21:35.642
You okay, baby?
What happened?

21:35.677 --> 21:37.044
See for yourself.

21:37.078 --> 21:38.445
It was amazing, Hank.

21:38.479 --> 21:41.682
It's the coolest thing
that I've ever seen.

21:42.817 --> 21:44.518
What?
It was, I'm sorry.

21:46.420 --> 21:47.720
- Richard--
- Peek-a-boo,

21:47.755 --> 21:49.122
and fine wine.

21:49.156 --> 21:50.123
Come on up, honey.

21:50.157 --> 21:52.090
Come-- Get down now.

21:52.125 --> 21:54.192
- I can't remember the song.
- Karen.

21:54.227 --> 21:55.426
Jesus.

21:55.461 --> 21:56.694
What the fuck are you doing here?

21:56.729 --> 21:58.096
It's a long story, and ultimately

21:58.130 --> 21:59.664
not as interesting
as what's happening here.

21:59.698 --> 22:01.332
What happened?

22:01.366 --> 22:02.700
Tyler switched drinks,

22:02.734 --> 22:04.101
thought it would be funny
to watch him get drunk.

22:04.136 --> 22:06.137
Jesus, that kid really is a young me.

22:06.171 --> 22:08.172
Hey, Batesy!

22:08.207 --> 22:09.841
Hank, God damn it!
It's great to see you!

22:09.875 --> 22:11.376
I'm so glad you could make it.

22:11.410 --> 22:12.377
Good to see you too, man.

22:12.412 --> 22:13.979
Loving that man-gina.

22:14.014 --> 22:16.182
Thank you.
It is fucking liberating.

22:16.216 --> 22:17.850
Hey, you wanna come down
and put some clothes on

22:17.885 --> 22:19.452
before the law gets here?

22:19.486 --> 22:20.987
No, no, nonsense.
I'm tucked.

22:21.021 --> 22:22.456
You know, I was just telling Karen

22:22.490 --> 22:24.691
I used to fuck guys
like Tyler back in prison.

22:24.725 --> 22:27.127
Did I ever tell you about
the year I spent behind bars?

22:27.161 --> 22:28.461
No.

22:28.496 --> 22:30.096
Yeah, I was researching
a novel about prison life,

22:30.130 --> 22:32.364
so I knocked over
a little liquor store.

22:32.399 --> 22:34.133
The research was great,

22:34.167 --> 22:36.267
but there was an unexpected gift.

22:36.302 --> 22:37.736
I fell in love there, Hank.

22:37.770 --> 22:40.371
Twice.
Two very different men.

22:40.406 --> 22:41.372
Mm-hmm.

22:41.407 --> 22:43.074
And we still keep in touch.

22:43.108 --> 22:44.208
I gotta tell you,

22:44.243 --> 22:45.977
men in prison
make exceptional pen pals.

22:46.011 --> 22:48.012
Letters like fucking short stories.

22:48.047 --> 22:49.447
You remember your first
short story, Hank?

22:49.481 --> 22:50.615
Yeah.

22:50.650 --> 22:53.018
Finishing mine
gave me a thunderous erection.

22:53.052 --> 22:54.753
You remember your first erection?

22:54.787 --> 22:56.287
Yeah, I had a big crush

22:56.322 --> 22:58.023
on the blonde from
<i>the Beverly Hillbillies.</i>

22:58.057 --> 22:59.691
Elly May Clampett.

22:59.726 --> 23:02.728
Spilt a lot of boy milk
to that foxy little tramp.

23:02.762 --> 23:04.664
Yeah.

23:04.698 --> 23:06.132
You know, thanks to that fine memory,

23:06.166 --> 23:08.134
the blood is starting
to flow down south.

23:08.168 --> 23:10.604
This could be
pretty hard to tuck in a minute.

23:10.638 --> 23:12.272
- I hear you.
- I'm going for a run.

23:12.307 --> 23:14.008
Give me a hug.

23:14.042 --> 23:17.111
There you go.
There you go.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.713
I love you, babe.

23:18.748 --> 23:20.282
Don't wait up.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.518
Hey, hey, hey.

23:22.552 --> 23:24.019
You want me to go after him?

23:24.054 --> 23:26.655
No, I don't.
Just let him run it off.

23:26.690 --> 23:28.057
Hey, Tyler, not cool.

23:28.091 --> 23:29.091
I'm speechless.

23:29.126 --> 23:30.893
- Not cool.
- I am speechless.

23:30.928 --> 23:32.628
- Not cool at all.
- I know, I know.

23:32.663 --> 23:34.563
Okay, I'm sorry, all right?
I feel bad.

23:34.598 --> 23:35.798
Yeah.

23:35.832 --> 23:37.233
But, look, Becca told me
all these stories

23:37.267 --> 23:39.702
about how crazy he gets
when he drinks.

23:39.736 --> 23:41.403
And, look, it was just--
it was too tempting.

23:41.438 --> 23:42.638
All right, much as I hate to say it,

23:42.672 --> 23:44.106
I understand, but--

23:44.140 --> 23:45.640
Besides, he was being a total dick.

23:45.675 --> 23:47.208
It's like he was
standing in for you tonight.

23:47.243 --> 23:48.676
Literally giving me a hard time

23:48.711 --> 23:50.745
about every single word that
was coming out of my mouth.

23:50.779 --> 23:52.580
Shit just gets tiring, you know,

23:52.614 --> 23:54.348
and I just hit my limit.

23:54.382 --> 23:56.150
Yo, an order of ankio, man.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.384
Is he with you by any chance?

23:57.418 --> 23:59.319
- Who, that--
- Yeah.

23:59.353 --> 24:00.520
- That woman?
- No, him.

24:00.554 --> 24:02.722
Oh, him?
Officer Dolemite over there?

24:02.756 --> 24:04.357
No, I've never seen him
before in my life.

24:04.391 --> 24:06.158
Yeah? 'Cause I'm pretty
sure he was there

24:06.192 --> 24:07.526
the night I got my ass kicked.

24:07.561 --> 24:09.061
Really? That would be
quite a coinkydink.

24:09.096 --> 24:10.396
You sure you're not just being racist?

24:10.430 --> 24:11.464
You gotta check that--

24:11.498 --> 24:12.865
Yo, Moody, you seen that fucking

24:12.900 --> 24:14.033
naked guy run outta here?

24:14.068 --> 24:15.368
Fucking dick swinging

24:15.403 --> 24:16.569
in some real white boy shit, yo.

24:16.604 --> 24:18.572
Crazy.

24:18.606 --> 24:19.640
Hey, yo.

24:19.674 --> 24:20.907
Yo, ain't this the little Romeo

24:20.942 --> 24:22.142
we had to smack down at
the club the other night?

24:22.177 --> 24:24.545
Yes, yes, it is.
Good to see you.

24:24.579 --> 24:26.413
Good to see you too.
You're healing real good, son.

24:26.448 --> 24:28.816
Thanks.

24:28.850 --> 24:30.251
Dad, what did you do?

24:30.285 --> 24:32.786
Nothing. I did--I did nothing.

24:32.821 --> 24:34.622
- Will you tell them?
- Will you answer her?

24:34.656 --> 24:35.923
- Tell 'em.
- Tell 'em what?

24:35.957 --> 24:38.759
That I didn't do anything
of that nature.

24:38.794 --> 24:40.094
No, he ain't do anything though,

24:40.129 --> 24:41.429
but I knew it was important to him,

24:41.463 --> 24:42.630
so I took care of it.

24:42.664 --> 24:43.898
That's what we do for each other.

24:43.932 --> 24:46.033
I'd be happy to do it again
if necessary.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.368
It's not necessary.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.871
Let's go.

24:51.540 --> 24:53.007
They make a cute couple, man.

24:53.041 --> 24:54.575
I don't see why you getting so
fucking bent up about it.

24:54.610 --> 24:56.544
Thanks.
That was very helpful.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.212
Cool, let's get some sake.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.981
Unfiltered sake, nigori.

25:05.253 --> 25:06.820
I wanna see some new
pages tomorrow, Moody.

25:06.855 --> 25:09.857
What exactly have we learned tonight?

25:09.891 --> 25:11.458
Our boy Runkle learned what it's like

25:11.493 --> 25:13.127
to come in a tranny hooker's mouth.

25:13.161 --> 25:16.630
Thank you, Sam.
Thank you so much.

25:16.664 --> 25:18.631
I'd almost managed
to stop thinking about it

25:18.666 --> 25:21.000
for five whole seconds there.

25:21.035 --> 25:22.301
Gargle, gargle, yo.

25:24.338 --> 25:26.372
Holy shit, yo.
Check that out.

25:26.407 --> 25:29.309
What the fuck?

25:36.184 --> 25:37.551
Batesy!

25:37.585 --> 25:39.587
- Hey!
- Hey, want a ride?

25:39.621 --> 25:41.055
Oh, I don't mind if I do.

25:41.089 --> 25:44.725
Well, get on in.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.160
Thanks, boys.

25:46.195 --> 25:48.496
Who's up for a cocktail?

25:53.337 --> 25:55.044
Oh, fuck.
