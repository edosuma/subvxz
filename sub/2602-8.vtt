WEBVTT

00:01.193 --> 00:02.197
Careful!

00:02.198 --> 00:04.339
You only get one shot
at this, Peralta.

00:04.374 --> 00:05.979
Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

00:05.980 --> 00:08.182
I saw the first 15 minutes
of <i>The Hurt Locker.</i>

00:08.216 --> 00:09.784
Hurry!
The stench is too much.

00:09.818 --> 00:11.856
<i>We gotta get
those shoes outta here.</i>

00:11.890 --> 00:13.158
How much time
do we have?

00:13.159 --> 00:15.061
Scully ate his pot pie
30 minutes ago,

00:15.062 --> 00:16.931
<i>so we probably got 10 minutes
left on this nap.</i>

00:16.966 --> 00:18.835
12 if he's turkey tired.

00:18.869 --> 00:21.344
<i>All right, come to papa.</i>

00:21.345 --> 00:23.486
<i>It's trapped.
Abort mission.</i>

00:23.521 --> 00:25.696
I have an idea...

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:38.890 --> 00:41.529
Let's send these shoes
to hell.

00:43.971 --> 00:45.139
Oh, wait.

00:45.140 --> 00:46.707
Yeah, just smells
worse than before.

00:46.708 --> 00:48.776
Oh...
Ugh! Abort!

01:10.844 --> 01:13.448
Whoa! Why are you here
before me?

01:13.449 --> 01:15.419
Am I asleep?
Is this a dream?

01:15.420 --> 01:18.027
I am early because
Jimmy Brogan is here today.

01:18.028 --> 01:20.467
Why do you care so much
about some old reporter?

01:20.501 --> 01:22.136
Some old reporter?

01:22.137 --> 01:24.139
Is the sky just some
big blue hat

01:24.140 --> 01:25.541
that the world wears?

01:25.575 --> 01:27.811
No. And no one has ever
thought that.

01:27.812 --> 01:29.215
My point exactly.

01:29.216 --> 01:31.119
Jimmy Brogan
wrote <i>The Squad</i>

01:31.120 --> 01:33.321
about badass New York cops
in the '70s.

01:33.322 --> 01:35.023
<i>It's the best book
I've ever read,</i>

01:35.024 --> 01:36.791
and I've read 15 books.

01:36.792 --> 01:38.495
50 books is not a lot.
Wait...

01:38.496 --> 01:40.399
You said 15?

01:41.836 --> 01:43.240
<i>The Squad</i>
is what made me decide

01:43.241 --> 01:44.842
to become a Detective.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.477
And it was my first
book report.

01:46.511 --> 01:48.145
"The detectives wiped
the mobsters' blood

01:48.146 --> 01:51.518
off their boots
and found the scag."

01:51.519 --> 01:54.257
Scag is heroin,
and the book says it's so good,

01:54.258 --> 01:56.329
you can never stop doing it!

01:56.330 --> 01:58.231
See me after class,
Jacob.

01:58.232 --> 02:00.433
Fun side note...
I late lost my virginity

02:00.434 --> 02:02.035
<i>to Mrs. Stratton's
daughter.</i>

02:02.036 --> 02:04.439
It was... very fast.

02:04.440 --> 02:07.045
Nice.

02:07.046 --> 02:09.616
Mr. Brogan, these are
detectives Santiago

02:09.618 --> 02:10.886
and Peralta.

02:10.887 --> 02:12.889
Mr. Brogan, I am a huge fan
of your book.

02:12.890 --> 02:14.691
Would you mind
signing my copy?

02:14.692 --> 02:17.062
I'd love to.
It's always nice to meet a fan.

02:17.063 --> 02:19.100
You can just make it out
to "death wish."

02:19.101 --> 02:20.536
That's what everyone
calls me,

02:20.537 --> 02:22.741
'cause I'm always
first through the door.

02:22.742 --> 02:24.076
<i>You go through doors normally,</i>

02:24.077 --> 02:26.412
and everyone calls you
pineapples.

02:26.413 --> 02:27.781
My grandma calls me
pineapples,

02:27.782 --> 02:29.215
and I regret
telling you that.

02:29.216 --> 02:31.583
Those New York cops
from the '70s you wrote about

02:31.584 --> 02:34.650
were my idols... I mean,
Gaminsky, Cavanaugh, Quigg.

02:34.651 --> 02:36.284
Those guys
were the real deal.

02:36.285 --> 02:39.119
I once saw Gaminsky
choke a hippy to death

02:39.120 --> 02:40.421
with his own ponytail.

02:40.422 --> 02:42.024
Illegal.
Love that.

02:42.025 --> 02:43.424
Mr. Brogan
is writing an article

02:43.425 --> 02:45.124
about how Brooklyn
detectives have changed

02:45.125 --> 02:46.991
in the 35 years
since <i>The Squad.</i>

02:46.992 --> 02:48.689
He'll be observing
the two of you

02:48.690 --> 02:50.488
on your Internet
identity theft case.

02:50.489 --> 02:52.723
<i>I hope Mr. Brogan's presence
doesn't prove to be</i>

02:52.724 --> 02:54.425
a distraction to you,
Peralta.

02:54.426 --> 02:56.392
Distracted? Me?
No, sir.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.058
Evil would love that.

02:58.059 --> 03:00.892
But I'm not giving evil
the satisfaction.

03:00.893 --> 03:02.724
Not today.

03:02.725 --> 03:05.427
Where's the can?
I gotta unload.

03:05.428 --> 03:07.395
"Unload."
Great choice of words.

03:07.396 --> 03:09.462
It'd be an honor
to show you, sir.

03:09.463 --> 03:12.064
All right.
Everyone's here.

03:12.065 --> 03:14.466
Today we're gonna work on
our courtroom demeanor.

03:14.467 --> 03:17.065
Pass.
This seminar

03:17.066 --> 03:19.600
is not optional, Diaz.
You're testifying

03:19.601 --> 03:21.601
in an aggravated assault case
tomorrow.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.201
<i>The D.A. is worried</i>

03:23.235 --> 03:24.868
about how you present yourself
on the stand.

03:24.869 --> 03:26.766
Why?
I'm fine on the stand.

03:26.801 --> 03:28.364
Look, I'll make this
real simple

03:28.365 --> 03:29.898
so even these dum-dums
can understand.

03:29.933 --> 03:32.400
Man did crime.

03:32.401 --> 03:34.135
I'm sorry... can you
make her stop doing

03:34.136 --> 03:36.004
that weird thing
with her face?

03:36.038 --> 03:37.738
Crying?

03:37.739 --> 03:40.237
And when this is over,
I'm gonna find you,

03:40.238 --> 03:42.704
and I'm gonna break
those little fingers.

03:42.705 --> 03:44.806
Ms. Diaz.

03:44.807 --> 03:46.975
Please stop threatening
the stenographer!

03:46.976 --> 03:50.277
This is an important case.
You need to do well.

03:50.278 --> 03:51.977
Fine. I'll take
your dumbass seminar.

03:52.011 --> 03:54.144
That's the spirit!

03:55.780 --> 03:58.279
Someone has placed
tiny scanners inside ATMs

03:58.280 --> 04:00.045
to steal card numbers
and pins

04:00.046 --> 04:02.112
which they sell
on the Internet.

04:02.113 --> 04:04.313
Oh, good God, why do you
smell like an ashtray?

04:04.314 --> 04:05.815
Oh, sorry, <i>mom.</i>

04:05.816 --> 04:09.124
It's the only way I can cope
with the stress of the job.

04:12.759 --> 04:13.837
Pffft!

04:14.961 --> 04:17.127
Anyway...
We're running an algorithm

04:17.128 --> 04:18.627
to comb through
the transactions

04:18.661 --> 04:20.226
looking for a pattern
which will lead us

04:20.261 --> 04:22.159
to the perp's IP address.
Got it.

04:22.193 --> 04:23.959
"Boring mumbo jumbo."

04:23.991 --> 04:25.891
<i>Well, you could think
of the algorithm</i>

04:25.925 --> 04:27.458
as a boot
and the IP address

04:27.459 --> 04:28.826
as some poor slob's skull.

04:28.827 --> 04:29.961
You know?

04:29.995 --> 04:31.261
We used to call guys

04:31.262 --> 04:33.297
who bragged about
sitting around all day

04:33.298 --> 04:34.432
hair bags.

04:35.469 --> 04:37.638
Except for
Detective Finaldi.

04:37.639 --> 04:39.905
No, he had to sit
around all day.

04:39.906 --> 04:42.070
A mafia thug pried
both his kneecaps off

04:42.071 --> 04:43.470
with a crowbar.

04:43.504 --> 04:45.038
Gah... so lucky.

04:45.039 --> 04:46.874
This kind of data-driven
police work

04:46.875 --> 04:48.811
has reduced crime
by over 70%.

04:48.845 --> 04:51.248
I know hair bag work
when I see it.

04:51.282 --> 04:55.716
Do me a favor... wake me
when your shift is over.

04:57.351 --> 04:58.385
No way.

05:01.524 --> 05:03.492
That is amazing!

05:03.526 --> 05:05.496
All you need
is for a jury to like you.

05:05.530 --> 05:07.966
If they like you, they'll trust you.
<i>Fine.</i>

05:08.000 --> 05:09.634
How do I get these morons
to like me?

05:12.270 --> 05:13.604
Don't call them morons.

05:13.638 --> 05:15.304
Good instinct!
Okay.

05:15.305 --> 05:18.137
Sit up straight, all right?
Be aware of your hands, okay?

05:18.171 --> 05:19.505
And don't be afraid
to smile.

05:19.539 --> 05:21.007
And if you need to buy time,
you can always just say,

05:21.008 --> 05:22.643
"to be perfectly candid..."

05:22.677 --> 05:24.846
To be perfectly candid...

05:24.847 --> 05:26.214
I like that.

05:26.215 --> 05:28.317
<i>And always make
good eye contact.</i>

05:28.352 --> 05:30.219
But don't stare at people.
Yeah.

05:30.254 --> 05:31.887
You gotta blink.
<i>But don't blink too much.</i>

05:31.922 --> 05:33.955
Or too fast.
I think the bigger worry is slow blinks.

05:33.956 --> 05:36.122
Don't blink too fast or too
slow or too much or too little.

05:36.157 --> 05:38.623
I know how to <i>blink.</i>

05:38.658 --> 05:39.957
Quick question, sir.

05:39.958 --> 05:41.790
You know how we've been
trading favors back and forth

05:41.791 --> 05:43.092
and it's your turn
to give me one?

05:43.126 --> 05:44.495
None of that is true.
Yeah, I know.

05:44.529 --> 05:46.998
Please, can I jump onto
a sweet mob-related homicide?

05:47.033 --> 05:49.432
There are no sweet
mob-related homicides

05:49.433 --> 05:50.833
on which to jump.

05:50.868 --> 05:53.031
Boom!
There's one at the seven-three.

05:53.032 --> 05:55.197
Maybe I should
roll over there, help out.

05:55.198 --> 05:57.333
Brogan can tag along,
maybe write some stuff down.

05:57.368 --> 05:59.670
Why do you idolize that man
and the time he wrote about?

05:59.671 --> 06:01.606
Because the '70s
were amazing.

06:01.607 --> 06:03.542
I mean, everyone had
thick, juicy moustaches

06:03.543 --> 06:05.574
and all the clothes
were orange and flammable.

06:05.575 --> 06:07.573
The '70s were not
a good time for the city

06:07.574 --> 06:09.104
or for the department...

06:09.105 --> 06:10.472
Corruption, brutality,
sexism.

06:10.507 --> 06:13.141
Diaz and Santiago never
would have made Detective,

06:13.176 --> 06:14.376
and an openly gay man
like me...

06:14.377 --> 06:15.644
I never would have been
given a command.

06:15.678 --> 06:17.377
<i>There were very few
black detectives.</i>

06:17.410 --> 06:19.676
Did I ever tell you what my
first day on the job was like?

06:22.878 --> 06:24.379
Hello. I'm Raymond Holt.

06:24.414 --> 06:27.018
Are you... here
to turn yourself in?

06:28.655 --> 06:30.221
Ah, yeah,
that's really messed up.

06:30.255 --> 06:31.855
But the guys that Brogan
wrote about...

06:31.856 --> 06:33.758
They were great detectives.
I mean, they were legit.

06:33.759 --> 06:35.093
<i>Some of them were legit.</i>

06:35.128 --> 06:38.495
Some of them were just
Brogan's drinking buddies.

06:38.496 --> 06:40.160
Sir, that is
a brilliant idea.

06:40.161 --> 06:42.195
<i>It wasn't an idea.
It was a scathing indictment</i>

06:42.230 --> 06:43.497
of your personal hero.

06:43.531 --> 06:45.800
Eh, six of one.

06:45.835 --> 06:47.336
This is the best!

06:47.370 --> 06:48.704
Drinking with Jimmy Brogan.

06:48.738 --> 06:50.406
So tell me more
about Quigg.

06:50.407 --> 06:52.576
Could he really light
a matchstick on his face?

06:52.577 --> 06:54.146
One time during a drug bust,

06:54.147 --> 06:55.715
he had one of his fingers
shot off.

06:55.750 --> 06:57.851
He didn't even flinch.
He just picked it up

06:57.885 --> 07:01.555
and used it to flip off
every puerto rican in the place.

07:01.590 --> 07:03.457
And that's my cue.
It's late.

07:03.458 --> 07:04.859
Are you kidding?

07:04.894 --> 07:06.263
The old guard
drank till dawn,

07:06.264 --> 07:07.465
ate some coffee grounds,

07:07.466 --> 07:09.700
then started the whole day
all over again.

07:09.701 --> 07:11.933
Pfft!
I eat coffee grounds.

07:11.934 --> 07:13.202
Sure you do, pineapples.

07:13.236 --> 07:14.604
How about
another round?

07:14.605 --> 07:15.807
Are you kidding me?

07:15.808 --> 07:17.344
I wanna hang with you
till one of us dies.

07:17.345 --> 07:18.646
<i>Look, I'm tired
of talking.</i>

07:18.647 --> 07:20.852
Why don't you tell me
some of your stories?

07:20.886 --> 07:22.587
Great. 'Cause I got
some stories

07:22.588 --> 07:27.127
that'll make <i>Training Day</i>
look like <i>Super Troopers.</i>

07:27.162 --> 07:28.630
Eh, it's not... bartender.

07:28.664 --> 07:30.666
Two scotches.

07:30.667 --> 07:33.804
No, no, he meant two bottles.
What?

07:33.805 --> 07:36.270
I mean... yeah!

07:36.271 --> 07:38.606
Aaaalll... right!

07:42.399 --> 07:43.532
You'll never get me!

07:43.567 --> 07:44.567
You'll never get me!

07:44.568 --> 07:45.634
We already
got you, idiot.

07:45.669 --> 07:47.970
Look who's here.

07:47.971 --> 07:51.244
How was your night
of old-school drinking, hmm?

07:51.278 --> 07:52.811
Pretty hung over?
Shh!

07:52.812 --> 07:55.246
Turn off
your mouth siren.

07:55.247 --> 07:57.914
Here are the texts
I got from you last night.

07:57.948 --> 07:59.281
"Best night ever."

07:59.282 --> 08:01.316
"Why scotch burn so good?"

08:01.350 --> 08:04.121
"Whaz his name in <i>Serpico?"</i>

08:04.155 --> 08:06.192
"Who's the friend of yours
with the ping-pong?"

08:06.193 --> 08:07.692
And lastly,

08:07.693 --> 08:09.558
a picture of you
on the subway platform

08:09.559 --> 08:12.328
eating Chinese chicken salad
with no shirt on.

08:12.329 --> 08:16.068
Well, last night was awesome.

08:16.069 --> 08:19.582
We had an epic night of bonding
that I will never forget.

08:19.607 --> 08:21.976
Do it!
I believe in you.

08:24.414 --> 08:28.219
Throw it!
I believe in you.

08:28.220 --> 08:29.655
Man, I wonder
if Brogan's okay.

08:29.656 --> 08:32.058
He's 65 and drank
two bottles of scotch.

08:32.058 --> 08:33.826
He might be dead.
He looks fine to me.

08:33.861 --> 08:34.861
Morning, kid!

08:34.861 --> 08:36.129
Ooh!
How ya doing?

08:36.130 --> 08:37.865
Uh... hey...

08:37.866 --> 08:39.967
So good.
I feel great.

08:40.001 --> 08:42.400
And I definitely don't think
it's burning hot in here.

08:42.402 --> 08:43.969
Well, I'm around.

08:44.003 --> 08:45.502
Grab me if anything
develops in your case.

08:45.503 --> 08:47.036
You got it.

08:47.037 --> 08:49.037
That hurt so bad.
Let me know when he's gone

08:49.038 --> 08:50.970
so I can slide
onto the nice, cool floor.

08:51.004 --> 08:52.303
He's gone.
Great.

08:52.304 --> 08:53.970
Mmm...

08:56.973 --> 09:00.574
Oh... my whole body
has dry mouth.

09:01.876 --> 09:04.177
Why are we meeting
in the ladies' room?

09:04.212 --> 09:06.580
It's the perfect place
for our second lesson...

09:06.581 --> 09:07.848
Courthouse wardrobe.

09:07.883 --> 09:09.884
What's wrong
with the way I dress?

09:09.918 --> 09:12.553
You know, some people might
say that all the black leather

09:12.554 --> 09:14.388
kind of makes you looks like
an evil villain.

09:14.422 --> 09:15.890
<i>Not me.</i>

09:15.891 --> 09:19.597
I think you look like
a sexy motorcycle.

09:19.598 --> 09:21.265
Boyle, pull it together.

09:21.266 --> 09:22.400
Yeah.

09:22.434 --> 09:24.236
We need to
soften up your look.

09:24.270 --> 09:27.171
My wife and Charles's mom
donated some clothes.

09:27.172 --> 09:30.445
Your wife and Boyle's mom
are both blind?

09:33.050 --> 09:34.517
I look like arsenio.

09:34.552 --> 09:36.919
So it's... perfect?

09:38.619 --> 09:40.218
That's actually
my wedding suit.

09:40.219 --> 09:41.487
No.

09:41.521 --> 09:43.122
Yes.

09:43.123 --> 09:44.391
No.
No.

09:46.593 --> 09:49.496
That's great.
Perfect!

09:49.530 --> 09:50.731
You look beautiful... ly...

09:50.732 --> 09:52.733
Appropriate for court.

09:52.767 --> 09:53.867
♪ A new sensation

09:53.868 --> 09:55.334
Ohh...

09:55.368 --> 09:56.501
Scully.

09:56.535 --> 09:58.602
Hey, Jake.
You've been alive forever.

09:58.636 --> 10:00.271
How'd you used to cure
hangovers?

10:00.306 --> 10:02.942
Oh, I didn't drink.
I was, however,

10:02.943 --> 10:05.482
extremely into cocaine
for most of 1986.

10:05.516 --> 10:07.017
I gotta tell you the truth,
Hitchcock...

10:07.018 --> 10:08.651
Can I tell you the truth?
You and me, man.

10:08.652 --> 10:10.220
We're gonna be co-captains.

10:10.221 --> 10:12.022
But first I'm taking you
to Japan!

10:12.023 --> 10:14.059
I'm already packed!

10:14.060 --> 10:16.096
I had three heart attacks
that year

10:16.130 --> 10:17.197
and declared bankruptcy.

10:17.232 --> 10:19.266
Hitchcock turned out
just fine.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.867
My grandpa
was an old-school cop.

10:21.902 --> 10:25.170
This was his hangover cure...
Raw egg yolks.

10:25.171 --> 10:26.803
Aaahhh!

10:26.837 --> 10:29.871
You look like a corpse
we just pulled out of the river.

10:29.906 --> 10:31.408
Wrong. I look like
a cool rock star

10:31.409 --> 10:33.044
who oded in his own pool.
Big difference.

10:33.045 --> 10:34.613
I told you not to let
Jimmy Brogan

10:34.648 --> 10:36.082
distract you
from your work.

10:36.083 --> 10:38.786
So I assume you're not
too hung over to do said work?

10:38.820 --> 10:42.023
Pfft. Nope. It's like
I never even drank.

10:42.024 --> 10:43.157
And that's not
a hangover cure.

10:43.192 --> 10:45.389
What, that?
Naw, it's just some...

10:45.390 --> 10:47.625
Protein for my guns.

10:47.626 --> 10:50.896
I drink one every morning
before I lift.

10:50.930 --> 10:52.865
So...

10:55.837 --> 10:57.467
Gah!

10:57.468 --> 10:59.102
Ah ha ha!

10:59.103 --> 11:00.871
So good!

11:00.872 --> 11:03.643
You can barely even tell
it's a chicken embryo.

11:03.644 --> 11:05.314
You should drink it all.

11:05.315 --> 11:06.816
For your guns.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.387
Yeah.

11:16.060 --> 11:17.926
Agh.

11:17.961 --> 11:19.592
Ah, it's just like...

11:19.627 --> 11:21.494
Fitness, right?

11:23.298 --> 11:25.965
Oh, why did I do this?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.067
According to your text,
you were having

11:28.068 --> 11:29.600
"the beef light
of my loaf."

11:29.601 --> 11:32.202
What? No, no. Why did
I use this algorithm?

11:32.203 --> 11:34.339
We're only tracking people
who use the stolen cards.

11:34.340 --> 11:36.274
They might not be the same
as the ones who stole them.

11:36.275 --> 11:38.743
Here,
switch seats with me.

11:41.148 --> 11:44.553
Oh, wow.
Your butt's really warm.

11:44.587 --> 11:46.689
My butt's normal.
Your butt's the weird one.

11:46.723 --> 11:47.991
Don't be mad.
It's nice.

11:47.992 --> 11:50.056
All right, so if we ignore
all these fraudulent purchases

11:50.057 --> 11:52.058
and go back far enough...

11:52.059 --> 11:54.762
Here. Someone posted
the stolen card numbers online

11:54.763 --> 11:56.362
from this IP address.

11:56.363 --> 11:58.428
Not bad!
You found the pattern.

11:58.429 --> 12:00.762
All right, let's aspirin up
and roll out!

12:00.763 --> 12:03.130
Ah... ohh!

12:03.131 --> 12:04.197
Ohh...

12:05.500 --> 12:08.972
I'm glad you could
be here for this.

12:09.006 --> 12:12.040
Mike Halbrook.

12:12.041 --> 12:13.540
NYPD. Open up.

12:13.574 --> 12:15.474
Put your head
through the door.

12:15.475 --> 12:16.642
My head?

12:17.810 --> 12:19.043
We got a runner!

12:19.078 --> 12:20.577
Stop!
Hands in the air!

12:20.578 --> 12:21.944
Oh, wow.

12:26.545 --> 12:28.613
Hoo! Yeah!

12:28.648 --> 12:31.653
Good job.
I'm never drinking again.

12:31.654 --> 12:35.054
Hey. You know,
I was gonna take him out myself,

12:35.089 --> 12:37.321
but ladies first, so...

12:37.322 --> 12:38.756
Relax, kid.

12:38.790 --> 12:40.593
Being too hung over
to chase a perp?

12:40.594 --> 12:42.830
That's a classic
old-school move.

12:42.865 --> 12:45.969
You know, you are one of
the last few good cops

12:45.970 --> 12:48.436
fighting against
the rising tide of hair bags.

12:48.471 --> 12:50.571
That's what you're gonna
say in your article?

12:50.572 --> 12:51.871
Ah, don't worry,

12:51.872 --> 12:53.739
you're gonna come out
lookin' real good.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.475
Especially after
our talk in the bar.

12:55.476 --> 12:57.242
Ah...
So many good quotes!

12:57.243 --> 12:59.044
Especially about Holt.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.578
Cops are usually afraid

13:00.579 --> 13:02.812
to go after their
captains like that,

13:02.813 --> 13:07.012
but you, sir,
are old-school.

13:07.047 --> 13:08.916
You know it.

13:08.917 --> 13:10.617
Oh, pineapples...

13:10.618 --> 13:12.684
What did you do?

13:14.239 --> 13:16.150
Your witness counselor.

13:16.151 --> 13:18.685
Detective Diaz, it's always
a pleasure to see you.

13:18.719 --> 13:20.086
This is not good.

13:20.087 --> 13:22.755
The lawyer is that slimeball
grundhaven... Rosa hates him!

13:22.756 --> 13:24.391
She's dressed right.
We coached her.

13:24.392 --> 13:26.193
She'll be okay.

13:26.194 --> 13:29.032
<i>Would you please state
your name for the record?</i>

13:29.033 --> 13:31.335
To be perfectly candid...

13:31.336 --> 13:32.970
My name is
Detective Rosa Diaz.

13:33.004 --> 13:34.305
Well, thank you for
your candor

13:34.306 --> 13:36.041
regarding your own name.

13:37.077 --> 13:39.013
<i>Detective Diaz,</i>

13:39.048 --> 13:40.449
would you please
tell the court

13:40.450 --> 13:42.019
exactly how you're
involved in this case?

13:42.053 --> 13:44.155
I caught Mr. Ladd
physically beating his boss

13:44.156 --> 13:46.391
<i>with a fax machine.
Most of his cheek</i>

13:46.425 --> 13:47.759
was caved in.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.728
His head was basically
a blood fountain.

13:49.763 --> 13:52.030
I'm sorry, is this
amusing to you, Ms. Diaz?

13:53.432 --> 13:54.901
Blinking.

13:58.908 --> 14:00.509
Oh, no.

14:00.510 --> 14:02.713
Brogan just sent me
the quotes he's gonna run.

14:02.714 --> 14:04.748
I slammed Holt
like 50 times.

14:04.749 --> 14:06.082
Listen.

14:06.117 --> 14:07.384
"Holt would rather
I wear a tie

14:07.385 --> 14:08.552
"than solve a case.

14:08.553 --> 14:10.720
"Holt cares more about
catching clerical errors

14:10.721 --> 14:12.655
"than catching bad guys.

14:12.656 --> 14:15.424
Holt is way too
verticulis"?

14:15.425 --> 14:17.727
That's not even a word!
What were you thinking?

14:17.728 --> 14:19.528
We were just hanging out,
being old-school.

14:19.529 --> 14:21.198
He wasn't supposed
to quote me.

14:21.199 --> 14:23.402
I was off the record
the whole time.

14:23.403 --> 14:24.873
Oh, no wait.

14:24.874 --> 14:26.276
I'm goin' on the record.

14:26.310 --> 14:29.282
Jake Peralta...
Can dance!

14:30.417 --> 14:33.585
Whoo!
Whoo!

14:33.586 --> 14:36.057
Jimmy Brogan!

14:36.058 --> 14:37.626
You need to fix this,
okay?

14:37.660 --> 14:39.430
Those quotes
cannot run.

14:39.431 --> 14:41.464
It would be
devastating for Holt.

14:41.465 --> 14:43.766
And the department.
I'll fix it.

14:43.767 --> 14:45.902
Brogan's a cool guy.
We're friends now.

14:45.903 --> 14:48.673
I'll just talk to him,
awesome dude to awesome dude.

14:48.674 --> 14:51.178
I should brush my teeth
first, though, right?

14:51.179 --> 14:52.647
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, that's terrible.

14:52.648 --> 14:54.181
Ugh!

14:54.182 --> 14:55.550
Great advice, dummies.

14:55.551 --> 14:56.918
I look like a psycho
up there!

14:56.919 --> 14:58.988
Yes. You have to
pull it together.

14:58.989 --> 15:01.894
That's not helping!
That's what sarge says to me when I'm nervous.

15:01.895 --> 15:03.664
Rosa, I think
you're nervous.

15:03.665 --> 15:05.168
Of course I'm nervous!

15:05.169 --> 15:06.638
What did you think
was the problem?

15:06.639 --> 15:07.806
We just assumed you were
a terrifying human being

15:07.807 --> 15:09.040
with a short fuse.

15:09.041 --> 15:11.475
But if the problem
is that you're nervous,

15:11.476 --> 15:13.711
that's where
Charles Boyle lives, baby.

15:13.712 --> 15:15.280
I can help!
You just need to go

15:15.281 --> 15:16.649
to your happy place.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.823
What's that?
Sounds stupid.

15:18.824 --> 15:20.458
Oh, everyone's happy place
is different.

15:20.459 --> 15:21.959
For me, I just imagine
I'm slurping up

15:21.960 --> 15:23.995
the world's longest
piece of linguini.

15:23.996 --> 15:26.332
It just keeps going
and going.

15:26.333 --> 15:29.338
Every 20 feet of noodle,
there's a sauce change.

15:29.339 --> 15:31.508
I'm in my happy place
right now.

15:31.509 --> 15:33.208
Mmm... pesto.

15:33.209 --> 15:35.974
Mmm! Carbonara!

15:35.975 --> 15:38.578
Great!
Now I'm starving!

15:42.719 --> 15:44.654
Hey, hey, Jimmy Brogan.

15:44.655 --> 15:46.690
Thanks for meeting me.

15:46.691 --> 15:48.156
Welcome to
the Schvitz, kid.

15:48.157 --> 15:50.927
The most comfortable
place on earth.

15:50.928 --> 15:52.931
It's like crawling back
into your mother.

15:52.932 --> 15:54.666
Is that something
people wanna do?

15:54.667 --> 15:56.101
What'd you wanna
talk to me about?

15:56.102 --> 15:59.338
So I read those quotes
you sent me,

15:59.339 --> 16:01.741
and you...
Wrote them so good.

16:01.742 --> 16:03.510
The thing is...

16:03.511 --> 16:04.846
I know I hid it
incredibly well,

16:04.847 --> 16:07.751
but I was pretty drunk
when I said that stuff, so...

16:07.752 --> 16:09.186
Any chance
you wouldn't print it?

16:09.187 --> 16:11.386
Well, you said you were
going on the record.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.419
I was clearly
not in control.

16:13.420 --> 16:16.251
Well, maybe you should learn
to handle your brown.

16:16.252 --> 16:17.685
Eew.

16:17.686 --> 16:19.252
Look, you know
that I think

16:19.253 --> 16:22.455
you're like the number one
hero of the 20th century.

16:22.456 --> 16:24.391
But kinda feel like
you're being unfair here.

16:24.392 --> 16:26.358
"Feel like"?
Listen to her,

16:26.359 --> 16:29.060
Suzanne Somers over here.
Talk like a man.

16:29.061 --> 16:30.595
All right,
I will talk like a man.

16:30.596 --> 16:32.532
You got me drunk
and took advantage of me.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.368
Oh, come on.
Gah!

16:34.369 --> 16:35.739
Look, I'm asking you
nicely...

16:35.740 --> 16:37.608
Please don't print
the quotes.

16:37.609 --> 16:39.916
And I'm telling you nicely,
I'm printing them.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.384
No, you're not.

16:41.385 --> 16:44.021
What are you gonna
do about it?

16:49.224 --> 16:51.026
Hey, how'd it go with Brogan?
<i>Perfect.</i>

16:51.027 --> 16:52.329
Except I punched him
in the face

16:52.330 --> 16:53.831
and made everything
a billion times worse.

16:53.832 --> 16:54.831
What?

17:02.270 --> 17:03.981
Yeah.

17:04.008 --> 17:05.650
So, Detective Diaz,

17:05.676 --> 17:07.676
you saw my client
struggling with his boss,

17:07.678 --> 17:09.612
but you don't know
who initiated the fight.

17:09.613 --> 17:10.780
<i>To be perfectly candid,</i>

17:10.814 --> 17:13.031
I was pretty sure
it was the defendant.

17:13.048 --> 17:15.492
Oh, to be perfectly candid,
"pretty sure" is not definitive.

17:15.518 --> 17:17.922
I think I know
what happened.

17:17.957 --> 17:19.224
Well,
to be perfectly candid,

17:19.226 --> 17:20.373
no one cares what you think.

17:20.395 --> 17:22.040
<i>Do you actually know
anything,</i>

17:22.067 --> 17:24.233
or are you just guessing?

17:26.967 --> 17:29.502
Your client instigated
the fight.

17:29.503 --> 17:30.972
I'm certain.

17:30.973 --> 17:32.677
And I'm happy
to tell you why.

17:32.709 --> 17:34.045
Yes!

17:34.046 --> 17:35.447
She went to
her happy place.

17:35.448 --> 17:36.783
I know that, Boyle.

17:36.818 --> 17:39.484
You punched
Jimmy Brogan?

17:39.519 --> 17:40.726
What were you thinking?

17:40.753 --> 17:41.787
I was thinking

17:41.788 --> 17:43.229
that I needed to protect
this precinct.

17:43.257 --> 17:45.625
From things that I said
about this precinct

17:45.659 --> 17:48.094
to a reporter while drunk
and insisting he record me.

17:48.095 --> 17:49.663
I shouldn't have done it.
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

17:49.697 --> 17:51.433
Every time I think you might
make a decent Detective,

17:51.434 --> 17:52.635
you go and pull
something like this.

17:52.669 --> 17:56.005
I thought I could
handle my brown.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.639
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's gross.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.037
Go home!

17:59.071 --> 18:02.940
You got the rest of the day
to put your head on straight.

18:08.204 --> 18:10.736
Got Halbrook to cop
to every charge.

18:10.770 --> 18:12.569
Nice work, Santiago.
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

18:12.570 --> 18:14.404
Peralta figured out
the pattern, though,

18:14.405 --> 18:16.173
so he should get credit
for the collar.

18:16.174 --> 18:17.341
Have you seen him?

18:17.375 --> 18:19.411
I sent him home.
He assaulted Jimmy Brogan.

18:19.445 --> 18:22.448
Yeah. But that caveman
kinda had it coming,

18:22.482 --> 18:23.849
don't you think?

18:23.883 --> 18:26.355
Oh. He didn't tell you.

18:26.390 --> 18:28.391
Tell me what?
Never mind.

18:28.392 --> 18:30.860
If Jake didn't tell you,
he must have had a reason.

18:30.894 --> 18:33.693
It's not my place.
I'm disappointed in you, Santiago.

18:33.728 --> 18:36.627
I thought
you and I were close.

18:36.628 --> 18:38.829
I know you're
manipulating me...

18:38.830 --> 18:39.996
But I love it,

18:40.031 --> 18:42.133
and I will tell you
anything.

18:42.167 --> 18:44.701
So Jake went to the Schvitz
to talk to Brogan.

18:44.736 --> 18:46.836
What are you gonna
do about it?

18:51.536 --> 18:52.934
There's nothing
I can do...

18:52.969 --> 18:55.671
Except to ask you nicely
as a fan of you,

18:55.672 --> 18:58.206
your work, and the guys
you wrote about...

18:58.207 --> 18:59.575
Please don't print
the quotes.

18:59.609 --> 19:00.842
Sheesh. I didn't realize

19:00.843 --> 19:02.310
you were gonna get your panties
all in a pretzel!

19:02.344 --> 19:04.176
That's actually not
technically possible.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.610
I'm not wearing underwear.

19:05.611 --> 19:08.212
It is swampy in here.
My butt's like the everglades.

19:08.246 --> 19:10.883
Look, I know you're trying to
be legit in a hair bag world,

19:10.884 --> 19:13.050
so I will not print
your quotes.

19:13.084 --> 19:14.752
Ah, thank you,
thank you!

19:14.753 --> 19:16.186
That means
the world to me.

19:16.187 --> 19:17.653
And for the record,

19:17.654 --> 19:19.121
I know that Holt
is a stickler,

19:19.122 --> 19:20.555
but he's actually
a really good cop.

19:20.590 --> 19:22.890
Don't worry about it.
We're friends.

19:22.891 --> 19:25.759
You don't have to stick up
for that homo.

19:27.061 --> 19:28.834
I really wish you
hadn't just said that.

19:28.863 --> 19:29.863
What, homo?

19:29.864 --> 19:30.864
Ooh!

19:30.865 --> 19:33.547
Thank you, Santiago.
That'll be all.

19:37.899 --> 19:39.066
Here she is.

19:40.735 --> 19:42.168
Diaz, you did it.

19:42.169 --> 19:44.035
They found him guilty
on all charges.

19:44.070 --> 19:45.603
Huh. Boyle's advice
worked.

19:47.104 --> 19:48.704
So...

19:48.738 --> 19:50.537
Where's your happy place?

19:50.571 --> 19:53.006
I'm in a cabin
in the middle of nowhere.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.474
Inside it's just me

19:54.508 --> 19:57.111
and that stupid,
slimy defense attorney.

19:57.112 --> 19:59.715
And I'm beating
the hell out of him.

19:59.749 --> 20:01.917
I break a dining room table
over his head.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.818
Then I rip off his arm

20:03.853 --> 20:05.687
and shove it
where the sun don't shine.

20:05.721 --> 20:07.856
Then I reach down
his throat

20:07.857 --> 20:10.128
and shake his hand.

20:13.569 --> 20:14.935
Yeah. Okay.

20:14.936 --> 20:17.905
I'm gonna go ahead and schedule
you for a psych eval.

20:19.074 --> 20:20.709
I owe you one, Boyle.

20:20.744 --> 20:21.945
Thank-you dinner.
Tomorrow night.

20:21.980 --> 20:24.150
Gribaldi's.
It's all-you-can-eat linguini.

20:25.687 --> 20:26.754
Yes!

20:26.788 --> 20:28.255
Oh, my boyfriend's
coming too.

20:28.256 --> 20:30.646
Your what friend now?

20:32.294 --> 20:33.795
<i>All right.</i>

20:33.829 --> 20:35.430
Let's hear it.

20:35.464 --> 20:37.501
Well, it's even worse
than I imagined.

20:37.535 --> 20:39.803
"The new face of the NYPD

20:39.804 --> 20:42.606
is perfectly embodied by
Brooklyn's own Jake Peralta..."

20:42.641 --> 20:43.775
That's not so bad.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.545
"Who cowers behind
his desk all day

20:45.546 --> 20:47.513
like the true hair bag
that he is."

20:47.547 --> 20:48.913
There it is.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.948
"The old guard would have
eaten a guy like Peralta

20:50.949 --> 20:53.953
for breakfast
and unloaded him by lunch."

20:53.954 --> 20:56.625
Well, it's very colorful.
And hurtful.

20:56.626 --> 20:59.527
You can ignore
that garbage, Santiago.

20:59.561 --> 21:01.795
Jimmy Brogan wouldn't
know a legit cop

21:01.796 --> 21:04.399
if he punched him
in the face.

21:08.207 --> 21:09.307
Well...

21:09.341 --> 21:12.308
Guess I'm done
with this.

21:12.309 --> 21:15.379
Not good enough.

21:15.414 --> 21:17.851
Three, two, one...

21:21.624 --> 21:24.792
Welcome to the party, pal!

21:24.793 --> 21:26.695
God,
you love that movie.

21:26.696 --> 21:28.378
It's <i>Die Hard.</i>
