[Lirrak] I am Lirrak, little mouse.
Mother of Oceans, Mother of Storms.

01:10.625 --> 01:13.375
I will not be contained!

02:50.458 --> 02:56.416

and you will be dead.

02:57.083 --> 02:59.041
[panting]

03:04.083 --> 03:06.041
[Mirana] We should be on the road by now.

03:06.833 --> 03:10.625
-Assuming this is the right road.
-I know my way back home.

03:13.958 --> 03:16.458
You should try sleeping in my tent.

03:17.791 --> 03:19.375
You look like death.

03:20.166 --> 03:21.833
You're not going to mock me?

03:21.916 --> 03:26.291
Tell me tents are for princesses,
no Dragon Knight would ever…

03:29.458 --> 03:31.500
-What's wrong with you?
-[Davion] I'm dying.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.708
It's called a hangover.

03:38.166 --> 03:41.500
Now pack your things,
we're three days behind schedule as it is.

03:45.750 --> 03:47.541
Fuck…

03:48.708 --> 03:52.875
-Lovers quarrel?
-We're not. No, it isn't.

03:52.958 --> 03:57.500
She seems easy to fight with.
If it's not her, then…

03:57.583 --> 03:58.875
It's not.

03:58.958 --> 04:01.125
-If you say so.
-I do say so.

04:02.291 --> 04:03.208
Hey!

04:04.166 --> 04:07.083
[tranquil music]

04:15.500 --> 04:16.916
That's the way.

04:19.041 --> 04:23.083
-You don't like her very much.
-I like her just fine.

04:23.166 --> 04:26.458
Nah. You haven't tried
to boss her around even once.

04:26.541 --> 04:29.666
It's your tell. I notice these things.

[growls]

04:57.791 --> 05:00.666
[rumbling]

05:00.750 --> 05:03.500
Hunting ground. No way around it.

05:04.875 --> 05:06.291
Why are you smiling?

05:06.375 --> 05:10.500
-I'm not. We need to…
-I see teeth. You're happy.

05:10.583 --> 05:11.500
[sighs]

05:12.166 --> 05:15.375
I… I guess it's nice to have a problem
I know how to solve.

05:15.458 --> 05:17.541
Like how not to become lunch.

05:18.250 --> 05:22.416
They hunt by movement.
Stay out of sight, stay still.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.750
-Or end up like that deer.
-What if there's no cover?

05:25.833 --> 05:26.958
Find it.

05:40.083 --> 05:43.458
[rumbling]

05:52.375 --> 05:54.583
-Oh, uh!
-[giggles]

05:54.666 --> 05:56.916
What are you drawing?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.958
[Filomena] Isn't it magical, Papa?

05:59.458 --> 06:00.625
Mm.

06:00.708 --> 06:04.041
And what will you name it?
There's power in a name.

06:04.125 --> 06:08.666
I need to study if before I name it,
so I give it the right one.

06:08.750 --> 06:12.458
Very wise.
Now I need to show you something.

06:12.541 --> 06:13.375
[gasps]

06:14.458 --> 06:15.500
[Invoker] Home.

06:19.125 --> 06:19.958
[gasps]

06:27.500 --> 06:30.291
[giggling]

06:33.458 --> 06:35.166
Mother…

06:35.250 --> 06:38.375
-I'm sorry.
-Perhaps she'll visit.

06:38.458 --> 06:39.750
You know she won't.

06:41.291 --> 06:44.500
I miss her too. Don't be sad.

06:45.958 --> 06:47.708
Magical child.

06:49.416 --> 06:54.125
-Filomena, show me. Does it hurt?
-Only a little.

06:54.208 --> 06:55.791
Sensitivity to touch.

06:55.875 --> 06:59.708
Veins, bruises, rash.
How long have you had these?

07:01.250 --> 07:02.625
Since we left Mother.

07:03.791 --> 07:07.375
I thought it would fade.
I didn't wanna worry you.

07:08.291 --> 07:09.666
[gasps]

07:09.750 --> 07:12.708
What? What's wrong with me, Papa?

07:12.791 --> 07:16.041
-Am I all right?
-Of course you are.

07:16.125 --> 07:18.291
You have me. Hm?

07:18.375 --> 07:21.375
[somber music]

07:31.958 --> 07:33.208
[Davion] Set up camp here.

07:33.875 --> 07:35.833
It should be safe enough for the night.

07:38.375 --> 07:43.875
-She talks to you.
-Fymryn? Yeah. About life, trees.

07:43.958 --> 07:46.083
You know she has 87 words for "moonlight"?

07:46.166 --> 07:49.666
-None of which I can pronounce.
-She sounds endlessly delightful.

07:49.750 --> 07:52.166
But she's said nothing else to you?

07:52.875 --> 07:58.291
-Nothing about me, or…
-Princess, you sound jealous.

07:58.375 --> 08:00.583
All that roaring damaged your ears.

08:00.666 --> 08:03.916
-[Fymryn] Looks good to me.
-Luxury accommodations.

08:06.625 --> 08:09.791
-Oh, you were saying?
-[Mirana] Not a word.

08:10.291 --> 08:12.125
They're going to have a slumber party.

08:12.208 --> 08:13.583
Chat the night away.

08:14.541 --> 08:15.916
How sweet.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.958
[Davion] You're quiet.

08:22.583 --> 08:24.083
[Fymryn] I'm just…

08:24.166 --> 08:25.875
I'm not very good at being alone.

08:26.791 --> 08:28.791
You're lucky your pod is with you.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.500
-Gods' mercy.
-I'm sorry, I thought…

08:31.583 --> 08:32.875
The three of us?

08:32.958 --> 08:34.333
No. We… We're not…

08:34.416 --> 08:37.541
So it's true about humans.
You have just one lover.

08:37.625 --> 08:40.833
-At a time. Usually.
-One person?

08:40.916 --> 08:44.583
-The same person every night?
-How do you handle more?

08:44.666 --> 08:48.166
I mean, I get it. The more the merrier
in certain circumstances, but…

08:48.250 --> 08:49.416
[Mirana] Davion.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.750
It must get crowded. Which is not good.

08:53.833 --> 08:58.166
It's true, there are more of us,
so more ups, downs, more fighting.

08:58.250 --> 09:00.666
But we're family. Always in it together.

09:00.750 --> 09:03.333
So your pod is waiting for you in Coedwig?

09:05.208 --> 09:06.333
No.

09:07.375 --> 09:08.875
No one is waiting for me.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.291
The Dark Moon Order made sure of it.

09:12.375 --> 09:16.166
-I'm sorry.
-Don't you dare take pity on her.

09:16.250 --> 09:19.833
-This is her doing. Her choice.
-Wait, what's…

09:19.916 --> 09:21.750
[Mirana] Selfish. Stupid.

09:21.833 --> 09:26.541
And for what? Senseless deaths.
A war no one asked for.

09:26.625 --> 09:28.833
You came to the Nightsilver Woods.

09:28.916 --> 09:32.750
You stole the lotuses.
And the blood is on your hands.

09:32.833 --> 09:36.625
And now you're going to tell me
what the real game is.

09:36.708 --> 09:38.000
[yells]

09:40.958 --> 09:42.166
[Sagan growls]

09:42.250 --> 09:46.125
-At this range I'm fairly accurate.
-My family is dead.

09:46.208 --> 09:49.500
-Slaughtered.
-Whoa, we're not doing this here.

09:49.583 --> 09:54.083
I will shoot through you.
Why did you hide who you really were?

09:54.166 --> 09:58.208
-Why did you say nothing?
-I just wanna go home.

10:00.416 --> 10:03.791
-You said nothing to me about…
-I couldn't let her know I knew.

10:03.875 --> 10:05.916
I had to know what she would not say.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.291
So you kept me in the dark. You used me.

10:08.375 --> 10:11.500
I tried to tell you.
You were too busy making friends.

10:11.583 --> 10:14.666
-I'm not making friends with…
-[Mirana] And you're not talking to me.

10:15.291 --> 10:17.458
I must have done something
to earn your silence.

10:17.541 --> 10:19.000
You could at least tell me what.

10:20.958 --> 10:24.250
You didn't do anything. We need her.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.750
I'm going to go find her,
before a wyrmling does.

10:28.833 --> 10:32.125
[Sagan growls softly]

10:33.458 --> 10:36.458
Fymryn, come back. It's not safe.

10:37.166 --> 10:38.708
I know you're there.

10:38.791 --> 10:41.916
I'm sure Mirana didn't mean what she said.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.375
Well, not all of it.
But you saw what those wyrmlings can do.

10:46.458 --> 10:50.000
They'll eat you alive.
I can't have that on my conscience.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.000
Please, come back.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.541
We've all lost too much already.

10:58.666 --> 11:01.250
[Mirana] I can't believe he took her side.
It's maddening.

11:01.333 --> 11:05.333
I've never met anyone kinder, braver…

11:05.416 --> 11:08.833
Well, except you, of course.
Or truer to his word.

11:08.916 --> 11:13.291
But his judgment…
She destroyed our lives.

11:13.375 --> 11:15.833
I realize I chose to say nothing,

11:15.916 --> 11:18.500
so I share some of the blame
in all this, but…

11:20.000 --> 11:23.166
[sighs]
You're right. I should sleep on it.

11:23.250 --> 11:27.041
I'll talk to Davion in the morning,
he'll understand, he'll listen.

11:27.125 --> 11:29.000
-[Marci snoring]
-[sighs]

11:33.750 --> 11:35.500
Thank you, Marci.

11:36.875 --> 11:39.041
You always know exactly what to say.

-Good night.
-Night, Papa.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.583
-[door opens]
-[Invoker] This is not sleeping.

12:17.666 --> 12:21.416
This flower, it's made
from two different kinds of flowers.

12:21.500 --> 12:22.625
Filomena…

12:22.708 --> 12:25.750
They don't even grow
anywhere near each other.

12:25.833 --> 12:28.375
-They're called hybrids.
-[Invoker] Remarkable.

12:28.458 --> 12:31.166
Like your ability to change the subject.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.666
-Bed.
-Hm!

12:35.458 --> 12:38.000
-[Invoker] What is this?
-The flower's movements.

12:38.083 --> 12:40.000
Most plants follow the sun.

12:40.583 --> 12:41.708
Heliotropism.

12:42.541 --> 12:45.208
Heliotropism.

12:45.833 --> 12:49.250
This one doesn't.
This one follows the moon.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.041
Isn't that wonderful?

12:52.583 --> 12:53.875
Beyond words.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.958
It is a full moon tonight.

12:58.041 --> 13:00.708
[tranquil music]

13:05.916 --> 13:08.750
[mage] The disease has infected her blood.

13:08.833 --> 13:13.166
Herbs, magic.
None of our treatments are effective.

13:13.250 --> 13:20.083
I have read every book.
Consulted with every scholar, healer.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.791
All of you… Nothing.

13:22.875 --> 13:27.500
[mage] We have done everything,
but death cannot be defeated.

13:27.583 --> 13:30.375
-Nothing can change that.
-I can.

13:30.458 --> 13:32.291
[healer] A god, perhaps. Her mother.

13:32.375 --> 13:33.875
Get out!

[growls]

13:40.500 --> 13:41.583
[door opens]

13:45.291 --> 13:46.291
Rise, dearest.

13:47.416 --> 13:50.041
We're going on a trip. Over the mountains.

13:50.125 --> 13:53.625
-To visit the flowers?
-To see your mother.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.208
[birds chirping]

13:58.625 --> 14:00.208
[Mirana] Your friend came back.

14:01.333 --> 14:03.000
She stole the lotuses.

14:04.083 --> 14:04.916
Again.

14:05.875 --> 14:07.583
[panting]

14:08.250 --> 14:12.000
She went this way.
Straight into air dragon territory.

14:12.083 --> 14:13.166
Not a good way to die.

14:14.041 --> 14:17.083
Rest easy.
That little elf is hard to kill.

16:59.833 --> 17:00.875
[Davion] Fymryn!

17:02.458 --> 17:03.625
Listen carefully.

17:03.708 --> 17:08.875
I'm going to get us out of here,
but you need to do exactly as I say.

17:08.958 --> 17:11.000
[growling]

17:11.083 --> 17:14.833
Hey! And… go!

17:15.625 --> 17:17.083
Go. Go!

17:17.583 --> 17:18.708
Fuck.

17:26.291 --> 17:28.583
What the hell are you waiting for,
an introduction?

17:28.666 --> 17:30.916
Use your magical… whatever it is.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.416
-I can't. Not with the box.
-Then give it to me.

17:35.833 --> 17:38.708
Is it worth dying in this hole
over those damn flowers?

17:38.791 --> 17:39.666
[Fymryn] It has to be.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.416
[air dragons roar]

17:41.500 --> 17:44.291
-Why did you take them?
-Because what I did…

17:44.375 --> 17:46.041
I can't give them back to Selemene.

17:46.125 --> 17:49.916
I can't let it all be for nothing.
Meaningless. I won't let go. Not ever.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.708
-Then I'm not leaving either.
-Why?

17:55.791 --> 17:57.541
I won't let you die alone.

17:59.625 --> 18:03.333
Since I was a little boy,
I thought my purpose was to slay dragons

18:03.416 --> 18:06.208
so no other little boy
would have to watch his family die.

18:06.291 --> 18:10.708
Then I learned it's not that simple.
There's a monster inside of me.

18:10.791 --> 18:12.333
A dragon.

18:12.416 --> 18:16.083
Someday, he's going to come out,
and I won't come back.

18:16.166 --> 18:19.416
But if I'm gonna die,
I need it to mean something.

18:19.500 --> 18:24.958
Right now, that's Mirana.
I owe her everything. I won't fail her.

18:25.041 --> 18:28.541
Trust me, letting go
doesn't make your past meaningless.

18:28.625 --> 18:31.375
Dying here, now? That does.

18:31.458 --> 18:34.166
It means you never learned
a gods-damn thing.

18:36.250 --> 18:39.250
[dramatic music]

18:40.250 --> 18:42.333
I can't take you with me.

18:42.416 --> 18:46.041
I'll be fine. I'll do something crazy.
Or stupid.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.458
But don't worry, crazy and stupid
is working for me so far.

19:00.583 --> 19:01.916
[roars]

19:05.166 --> 19:06.541
[Davion groaning]

19:08.041 --> 19:09.291
[growls]

19:16.583 --> 19:17.708
Come on.

19:24.416 --> 19:25.583
[air dragon roars]

19:27.333 --> 19:28.208
[wings flapping]

19:28.291 --> 19:29.958
[screech]

19:37.875 --> 19:39.333
[footsteps approaching]

19:43.416 --> 19:45.708
What happened in there?
What happened to you?

19:47.750 --> 19:48.583
What?

19:50.666 --> 19:54.250
I have to tell you something.
I should have told you before, I know.

19:54.333 --> 19:57.875
But you were carrying so much.
You didn't need my burden.

19:57.958 --> 19:59.583
And you would have made me stay.

20:02.500 --> 20:05.958
I'm listening. Just speak the words.

20:06.041 --> 20:09.666
[tranquil music]

20:11.375 --> 20:13.125
[inaudible dialogue]

20:26.166 --> 20:27.083
[leaves rustle]

20:30.541 --> 20:32.250
I know you're there.

20:32.333 --> 20:33.166
[swooshes]

20:35.666 --> 20:39.416
We're supposed to be following you,
not the other way around.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.750
Air dragons are dangerous, but my people?

20:43.541 --> 20:47.166
-You'll need a guide.
-We can find another guide.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.083
[Davion] No, we can't.

20:49.166 --> 20:54.000
I know there's no trust between you,
but you can both trust me.

20:54.083 --> 20:57.833
We're all going to the same place.
We should go there together.

21:01.750 --> 21:04.875
I suppose I can learn to live with you.

21:05.958 --> 21:10.458
-Agreed.
-See? Friends. That's great.

21:11.666 --> 21:13.958
So, who knows a song?

21:14.708 --> 21:17.958
I learned one from the dragons,
but it's not very good.

21:21.833 --> 21:25.125
You left me. Abandoned me.

21:25.208 --> 21:28.833
Filomena is ill.
Beyond the care of healers.

21:28.916 --> 21:34.166
She needs help. Your help.
She needs her mother.

21:34.250 --> 21:37.666
You took her
because you refused to worship me.

21:38.166 --> 21:41.250
Now you return, begging me to save you.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.416
[Invoker] Not me. Her.

21:45.666 --> 21:46.500
Mother…

21:47.125 --> 21:50.708
-You failed her.
-[Invoker] I learned my limits.

21:50.791 --> 21:55.166
[Selemene] We all have limits.
Even I have limits.

21:55.875 --> 22:00.333
There are things you need from me.
There are things I need from you.

22:00.416 --> 22:03.791
-Name them.
-Devotion. Faith.

22:05.208 --> 22:09.958
Kneel. Speak the words. Worship me.

22:10.041 --> 22:13.791
-This is your child.
-[Selemene] And your choice.

22:13.875 --> 22:18.333
Worship me,
and correct all of your mistakes.

22:19.916 --> 22:20.833
[sighs]

22:22.291 --> 22:23.375
I…

22:26.166 --> 22:28.708
I am yours, Selemene.

22:28.791 --> 22:32.791
-You have my devotion. My faith.
-Do you love me?

22:32.875 --> 22:33.833
[gasps]

22:35.458 --> 22:36.416
I love you.

22:36.500 --> 22:40.708
And you, child. Speak the words.

22:40.791 --> 22:41.875
[Filomena] No.

22:41.958 --> 22:44.583
Filomena, speak the words.

22:44.666 --> 22:45.875
I won't say them.

22:46.791 --> 22:49.291
You're my mother, not my goddess.

22:50.125 --> 22:53.416
-I want my mother.
-Just speak the words.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.916
You know nothing of the flowers
that grow over the mountain.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
[Invoker] Filomena…

22:57.625 --> 23:00.791
I love you. I won't worship you.

23:01.791 --> 23:02.708
[sighs]

23:03.291 --> 23:04.708
I want my mother.

23:04.791 --> 23:08.208
Selemene, she's just a child.

23:09.875 --> 23:11.708
She doesn't know what she's saying.

23:13.791 --> 23:15.041
You have me.

23:15.708 --> 23:17.458
You won, okay?

23:17.541 --> 23:19.333
Just heal her.

23:19.416 --> 23:20.500
You have that power.

23:20.583 --> 23:21.541
Please!

23:22.541 --> 23:24.291
Selemene, come back!

23:25.083 --> 23:26.416
[Invoker] Come back!

23:26.500 --> 23:29.416
[ominous music]

23:31.666 --> 23:32.750
[growls]

23:33.666 --> 23:35.666
[rumbling]

23:42.833 --> 23:44.041
Come back.

23:46.500 --> 23:49.500
[closing theme music]
