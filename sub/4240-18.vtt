So here's what happened
last week—

00:03.921 --> 00:05.713
Kurt found a video of Sue,
and the Glee Club
posted it online.

00:05.798 --> 00:07.882
You, my friend,
are an embarrassment.

00:07.966 --> 00:10.134
And then somebody made a "Glist"
of who in the Glee Club
was the naughtiest.

00:10.219 --> 00:12.261
So Rachel tried
to seem like a bad girl...

00:12.346 --> 00:14.013
by doing a video with Finn,
Puck and Jesse,

00:14.098 --> 00:15.640

and the song was really bad—

00:15.724 --> 00:17.308
Like maybe the worst song
ever written.

00:17.393 --> 00:19.227
Also, Sue spilled the beans
that Will sucked face
with Shelby Corcoran...

00:19.311 --> 00:21.020
and that one time
April Rhodes spent the night,

00:21.105 --> 00:22.647

on Friday.

washes your hair?

and how she's always telling me...

to wear a hat
when I'm cleaning pools.

01:16.869 --> 01:19.495
So, she made me
go see Dr. Friedlander,
the dermatologist.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.373
He said he had
to shave my head
to get a closer look at it.

01:22.458 --> 01:25.877

over a freaking freckle.

35:41.431 --> 35:45.392
[Clapping]

35:47.479 --> 35:49.730
That was some
serious singing, kid.

35:51.399 --> 35:55.611
- That was "Rose's Turn."
- I could get into that, maybe.

35:56.738 --> 35:59.240
What happened to the hoagies?
Ah, blew it off.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.075
You know-
Too much cholesterol.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.285
I bet Finn was disappointed.

36:03.370 --> 36:05.287
He understood, uh,

36:05.372 --> 36:08.541
once I told him
how bent out of shape
I thought you were.

36:08.625 --> 36:11.126
Me? I'm fine.

36:11.211 --> 36:14.463
Kurt, I'm dumb,
but I'm not stupid.

36:15.632 --> 36:18.259
And I have no idea
what that song was about,

36:18.343 --> 36:20.553
but "fine" don't sing
like you just sung.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.683
Look.

36:25.767 --> 36:29.270
Maybe I got carried away
doing stuff with Finn,

36:29.354 --> 36:32.273
but, you know, I told you
this thing with you
was going to be hard.

36:32.357 --> 36:35.150
Thing with me.
You mean being gay.

36:35.235 --> 36:38.279
Yeah, being gay.

36:39.281 --> 36:41.532
Look, I will fight
to the death...

36:41.616 --> 36:44.118
for your right to love
whoever you want,

36:44.202 --> 36:46.579
but when you were
a little baby in my arms,

36:46.663 --> 36:48.497
did I dream about taking you
to baseball games...

36:48.582 --> 36:50.583
and talking about girls?

36:50.667 --> 36:53.669
Yeah, I did.
A lot of fathers do.

36:53.753 --> 36:56.589
I had no idea
how disappointing I was.

36:56.673 --> 36:58.966
Hey, come on.
Now, stop it right now.
I'm talking straight to you.

36:59.050 --> 37:02.219
Don't go playing the victim.
You know that's not
what I mean.

37:02.304 --> 37:05.055
I know.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.600
I'm sorry.

37:07.684 --> 37:10.978
I know you're
working hard on yourself
to make all this okay.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.273
Just seeing you,

37:14.357 --> 37:18.652
the way you are with Finn-
how easy it is—

37:20.989 --> 37:24.241
breaks my heart.

37:24.326 --> 37:27.369
Is that why you were
pretending to date
that daffy cheerleader?

37:27.454 --> 37:30.581
And dressing differently,
and singing Mellencamp?

37:30.665 --> 37:33.083
I just want you to know that...

37:33.168 --> 37:35.753
I'm going to work as hard as you
to make this okay.

37:35.837 --> 37:39.173
You don't have to work
at anything, Kurt.

37:41.051 --> 37:43.636
Your job...

37:43.720 --> 37:46.430
is to be yourself,

37:46.514 --> 37:49.892
and my job is to love you
no matter what.

37:49.976 --> 37:52.394
Okay? That and a majority
ownership in a tire store-

37:52.479 --> 37:55.147
That's all we got.

37:55.231 --> 37:58.025
Okay?
We stick to that,
we're going to be great.

37:59.194 --> 38:02.529
[Sniffles]
I missed you, Dad.
Oh, come here.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.577
I love you.

38:08.662 --> 38:10.496
Love you too.

38:11.665 --> 38:12.665
[Knocking]

38:13.708 --> 38:15.209
Mom.

38:24.678 --> 38:27.596
- Finn with you?
- No. I came by myself.

38:27.681 --> 38:30.557
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.935
I, um—

38:33.019 --> 38:35.145
I just wanted
to say thank you...

38:36.773 --> 38:38.691
for showing me that...

38:38.775 --> 38:42.236
just because
I'm not good at anything
other than singing...

38:42.320 --> 38:45.114
doesn't mean I'm not
any good if I can't sing.

38:46.574 --> 38:50.995
That... sounded like
a really bad greeting card.

38:51.079 --> 38:53.080
No. It was cool.

38:54.749 --> 38:58.836
Well, anyways, I—
I just thought I could
maybe return the favor.

38:58.920 --> 39:02.256
I thought I could give you
singing lessons.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.676
It sort of seemed like
an area of interest for you.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.345
I'll- I'll come by, like,
once a week or something,

39:08.430 --> 39:11.056
and we could
just see how it goes.

39:11.141 --> 39:14.018
I've- I've helped
almost everyone
in our Glee Club,

39:14.102 --> 39:16.812
- some by brute force, but-
- So your voice came back?

39:16.896 --> 39:20.941
Turns out that a heroic dose
of antibiotics...

39:21.026 --> 39:22.901
and a mysterious blend
of herbal remedies...

39:22.986 --> 39:24.903
and a vow of silence...

39:24.988 --> 39:27.740
is all it takes
to cure tonsillitis, so-

39:27.824 --> 39:30.242
I'll probably have
to have my tonsils
taken out eventually,

39:30.326 --> 39:33.996
but, um, I'm—
I'm not scared anymore.

39:36.416 --> 39:39.001
Uh, so,

39:39.085 --> 39:41.462
do you want to give it
a spin now?

39:43.631 --> 39:45.507
Sing with you?

39:45.592 --> 39:47.342
Yeah.

39:47.427 --> 39:49.303
Yeah, I'd be honored.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.138
Come here.

39:54.934 --> 39:56.935
Take my hand?

40:01.858 --> 40:05.360
- Can you feel that?
- No. But it's weird-

40:05.445 --> 40:08.739
I remember what it feels like,
and...

40:08.823 --> 40:10.949
I can see it, so...

40:11.034 --> 40:12.993
it's like I can.

40:15.497 --> 40:17.706
I-I, um—
[Clears Throat]

40:17.791 --> 40:21.752

classic rock today.
