<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:11.845
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.929 --> 00:15.015
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.098 --> 00:18.268
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.352 --> 00:21.563
<i>Lucky there's a man who positively can do</i>

00:21.647 --> 00:23.106
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:24.942
<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

00:25.025 --> 00:30.155
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

00:34.701 --> 00:37.287
Aw, man, I've been dying
to see <i>Maniac Pope 2.</i>

00:37.371 --> 00:38.830
The first one was awesome.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.249
Is this one of those theaters

00:40.332 --> 00:42.292
where they bring your beef stew
right to your seat?

00:42.376 --> 00:43.877
What? That's not a thing.

00:43.961 --> 00:47.798
Sure is. Don't get mad at me
'cause you don't know nothing fancy.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.060
I feel like I'm being watched.

01:00.143 --> 01:04.106
Of course you are, silly.
The Lord is always watching us.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.911
May the sword be with you.

01:20.372 --> 01:22.708
- And also with you!

01:22.791 --> 01:24.710
Geez, this movie sucks.

01:24.793 --> 01:25.919
I know, it's terrible.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.713
Excuse me,
who had the stroganoff

01:27.796 --> 01:29.047
with the roasted potatoes?

01:29.131 --> 01:30.424
Right here.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.888
Thank you for seeing me, Your Excellency.

01:35.971 --> 01:38.932
Of course.
What did you say your name was, my child?

01:39.016 --> 01:40.100
Lucy.

01:42.561 --> 01:44.813
You've been "Lucified."

01:49.735 --> 01:51.111
That was awful.

01:51.195 --> 01:54.531
I know. They just redid all the same stuff
from the first <i>Maniac Pope.</i>

01:54.615 --> 01:58.535
Yeah, like in the first <i>Maniac Pope,</i>
he says to Bruce, "You've been Brucified."

01:58.619 --> 02:00.746
Like, that's smart, right?
That's a smart line.

02:00.829 --> 02:03.123
But he did the same thing twice
in this movie.

02:03.207 --> 02:06.001
Once to Lucy and once earlier
when he found that wild goose.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.211
It's just bad writing.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.087
Yeah, I mean, we could write
a better horror movie than that.

02:09.171 --> 02:10.672
Really? You think we could?

02:10.756 --> 02:14.676
Absolutely. I'm as creative
as the first spider to spin a web.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.303
Hey, you know how we always dreamed

02:16.386 --> 02:18.263
about having a house
that comes out of our butts?

02:18.347 --> 02:19.348
Uh, what?

02:19.431 --> 02:22.226
Eh? Yeah. Butt-house.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.901
I found your cigarettes.
That's all I'm gonna say.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.194
Morning, everybody.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.321
And the crisis continues.

02:34.404 --> 02:38.325
What, these? Come on.
Last thing I want is attention.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.494
It's just that when you've
read as many books as I have,

02:40.577 --> 02:42.037
it-it takes a toll, you know?

02:42.120 --> 02:45.332
You sure it's not from watching
too much close-up porn on your phone?

02:45.415 --> 02:47.167
You know,
I wouldn't be surprised

02:47.251 --> 02:48.418
if they have that now.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.337
Brian, what do you want for breakfast?

02:50.420 --> 02:51.922
Uh, hold on.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.344
What do I want?

02:57.427 --> 02:59.638
You're so full of it.
You don't need those things.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.181
Wait, who said that?

03:01.265 --> 03:02.641
Oh, Stewie.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.017
You are just horrible.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.979
You're even worse than those people
who take dumps in the shower.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.524
What? W-Why are you cutting to me?

03:10.607 --> 03:14.528
What did somebody say?
Whatever they said I do, I don't do.

03:18.156 --> 03:22.077
All right, I got a horror movie idea.
It's called <i>Cereal Killer.</i>

03:22.160 --> 03:25.497
A serial killer who only kills people
who eat cereal.

03:25.581 --> 03:28.083
Wait, what...
What if God is a serial killer?

03:28.166 --> 03:31.628
He lowers the average lifespan
of humans to 65,

03:31.712 --> 03:35.340
but there are many exceptions
based on genetics and diet.

03:35.424 --> 03:38.677
That's stupid. I ain't never
heard of somebody lived to 65.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.679
Look, I think the problem
is this is a bar.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.599
We can't get inspired here.
We have to go someplace scary, you know?

03:43.682 --> 03:44.808
To put us in the mood.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.311
the old Quahog Asylum.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.647
What? We can't go there.
That place has been abandoned for years.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.442
And they say it's haunted
by a ghost with a hook-hand.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.027
That's why it's the perfect place.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.654
If we want to write a scary movie,
we need to do it somewhere scary.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.239
Well, I guess we could try it.

03:59.323 --> 04:01.992
We have sort of just been
spinning our wheels here.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.327
No offense, Joe.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.329
I guess Cleveland's right.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.331
So far, this has been
a bigger waste of time

04:07.414 --> 04:09.666
than an acceptance speech
at the Asperger's Awards.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.627
I'd like to thank everyone I've ever met,

04:11.710 --> 04:14.046
in the order that I met them,
last name first,

04:14.129 --> 04:17.007
and if anyone interrupts me,
I'll have to start over.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.166
This place is terrible.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.459
Are you kidding?

04:52.543 --> 04:54.086
It's the perfect place
to write a horror movie.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.337
All right, well, I got an idea.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.839
You know, I like them horror movies

04:56.922 --> 04:58.924
where you got a couple
of teenagers getting busy

04:59.007 --> 05:00.843
in their car at Makeout Point,

05:00.926 --> 05:02.803
but there's a killer on the loose.

05:08.559 --> 05:11.645
Hey, Stacy, what do you say
we go all the way tonight?

05:11.728 --> 05:14.147
And then I unload on the sun visors.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.899
Is that all you ever think about?

05:15.983 --> 05:17.734
And besides, Richie, aren't you worried

05:17.818 --> 05:20.362
about what the man on the radio
is saying right now?

05:20.445 --> 05:22.531
<i>Another dead teenage couple</i>

05:22.614 --> 05:25.325
<i>was found at Makeout Point,</i>
<i>clawed beyond recognition.</i>

05:25.409 --> 05:28.161
You see?
There's a dangerous creature out there.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.706
Oh, what, you mean
the big, rabid, slobbery cat

05:30.789 --> 05:32.499
what's been scratching people to death?

05:32.583 --> 05:34.293
I don't believe it exists, Stacy.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.712
Now, help me get the right angle
and lower the visor.

05:38.589 --> 05:40.090
Richie, did you hear that?

05:40.174 --> 05:42.551
Will you calm down?
We're the only ones out here...

05:43.760 --> 05:46.221
- Rawr!

05:47.890 --> 05:48.974
Oh, my God!

05:58.066 --> 06:00.027
Wait, you were the guy and the cat?

06:00.110 --> 06:01.778
And what's with that visor stuff?

06:01.862 --> 06:03.447
Did Richie achieve release?

06:03.530 --> 06:06.200
Okay, of the three of you,
Cleveland's the only one who gets it.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.202
- That's an awful idea.
- Well, I got one.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.412
We should write one of them zombie movies

06:10.495 --> 06:13.373
where a guy wakes up
in a comfortable cotton hospital gown

06:13.457 --> 06:16.376
with the back open
so there's a nice breeze on your behind,

06:16.460 --> 06:18.128
and he's like, "This ain't bad."

06:18.212 --> 06:21.340
But then he notices the hospital's empty!

06:26.553 --> 06:29.556
Nurse, I'm ready for my sponge bath.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.434
Hmm. What happened to this place?

06:32.518 --> 06:34.186
Everybody up and gone.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.527
Hmm, that's annoying.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.032
Maybe it's a loose filament.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.661
Nope, that's a busted bulb.

06:54.164 --> 06:57.042
These are all 145s. I need a 180.

06:59.711 --> 07:02.965
Well, now, maybe I did need a 145.

07:04.675 --> 07:06.552
There we go.

07:09.555 --> 07:12.057
Damn it, I guess it's a wiring issue.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.433
That's it?

07:13.517 --> 07:15.227
What the hell?
When do the zombies show up?

07:15.310 --> 07:18.647
That's the thing. Their shuttle was late.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.608
I-I don't know, I-I was thinking
we'd write a movie where something

07:21.692 --> 07:23.986
that's not supposed to be scary
becomes scary.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.947
- Like an evil doll.
- Yeah, or-or like an evil bar of soap.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.866
Peter, I don't think
that's such a good id...

07:28.949 --> 07:29.950
Too late!

07:33.495 --> 07:35.747
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

07:35.831 --> 07:39.334
Time to wash my body
with this harmless bar of soap.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.924
Hey, Ambassador Mumbasa,

07:46.008 --> 07:48.051
are you enjoying
that new soap I bought you

07:48.135 --> 07:49.845
from that mysterious Chinese man

07:49.928 --> 07:52.306
whose store was weirdly
not there the next day?

07:53.640 --> 07:55.142
Ambassador Mumbasa?

07:56.185 --> 07:58.604
Oh, my God, Ambassador Mumbasa!

08:10.157 --> 08:11.783
Ambassador Mumbasa?

08:11.867 --> 08:13.660
Assistant Ambassador Armstrong?

08:13.744 --> 08:15.913
Everything okay up there with the bath?

08:32.221 --> 08:35.891
I wonder if everything's okay
up at the old embassy.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.938
All right, maybe coming here
wasn't such a great idea.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.941
Is anybody else getting a little
freaked out by all these scary stories?

08:44.024 --> 08:46.360
Yeah, even my spine is tingling.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.196
You guys, I'm scared.
You remember that movie <i>The Blob?</i>

08:49.279 --> 08:51.323
What if the Blob? Let's get out of here!

08:53.408 --> 08:54.868
Aw, damn it, it's locked!

08:54.952 --> 08:57.120
Oh, my God,
somebody must have locked us in.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.664
We're gonna die in here!

09:01.792 --> 09:05.504
Sorry, guys, somebody e-mailed me a video
of a sheep screaming.

09:15.013 --> 09:18.976
It was him. It was the hook-handed killer.
He locked us in!

09:19.059 --> 09:20.936
All the windows have bars on 'em.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.689
I think the only way out of here
is through this duct system.

09:23.772 --> 09:28.986
Guys, do the words "dead by dawn" scrawled
in feces over there mean we're in trouble?

09:29.069 --> 09:30.362
- Did you do it?
- I did.

09:30.445 --> 09:31.530
Then no.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.787
Still sticking with the glasses, huh?

09:38.871 --> 09:40.831
What? Oh, right. Right, I have glasses.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.625
They're such a part of me now,
I-I forgot all about 'em.

09:43.709 --> 09:44.751
You're gross.

09:44.835 --> 09:47.754
You know, it's funny,
I-I've gotten an awful lot of writing done

09:47.838 --> 09:49.673
at that very table.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.675
- You're a writer?

09:51.758 --> 09:53.677
I-I like to consider myself an observer.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.762
You have nice breasts,
for instance.

09:55.846 --> 09:59.391
You want to join me?
Guy with glasses can't be all bad.

09:59.474 --> 10:00.642
Thanks.

10:00.726 --> 10:02.394
Boy, it's loud in here, huh?

10:02.477 --> 10:05.480
Wh-When they said "Professor Griffin,"
I barely heard them.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.482
That's it, I'm putting an end to this.

10:07.566 --> 10:10.360
I'm gonna destroy those glasses
if it's the last thing I do.

10:10.444 --> 10:14.740
You should really check out
the Thanksgiving jazz CD they sell here.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.169
Where the hell are we?

10:28.754 --> 10:30.047
I heard something.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.757
Is... Is someone else here?

10:31.840 --> 10:34.718
Oh, my God, it's Hook-hand!
He's coming for us!

10:34.801 --> 10:36.762
Damn it, why can't I get any reception?

10:36.845 --> 10:39.473
Because we're in a basement
in the middle of nowhere.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.643
Besides, if cell phones worked,
every movie would be two minutes long.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.144
Like <i>An Affair to Remember.</i>

10:50.734 --> 10:54.071
Darling, I was running
to the Empire State Building to see you,

10:54.154 --> 10:55.739
but I got hit by a car.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.867
No wonder you were late.
I'll be right down. Are you okay?

10:58.951 --> 11:01.119
I think I may be paralyzed.

11:01.203 --> 11:03.830
I'm sorry,
there's nobody here by that name.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.676
Wow, Stewie,
thanks for taking me to the spa.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.344
Hey, you deserve it, buddy.

11:17.427 --> 11:20.806
So just relax, take your glasses off,
take a nice, dry sauna...

11:20.889 --> 11:22.224
No glasses in the sauna...

11:22.307 --> 11:25.143
Just leave those puppies in the locker.
They'll be safe out here.

11:25.227 --> 11:26.270
Sounds good.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.905
Come on, Chris.
Don't let me down.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.240
Don't worry, Stewie.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.367
Chris! What are you doing in here?

11:40.450 --> 11:43.036
I did it. I locked us in the sauna!

11:43.120 --> 11:45.289
- You what?
- Yep, it's all set.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.665
It's turned up high,

11:46.748 --> 11:49.376
and nobody is coming
for the whole weekend.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.886
Boy, you guys sure look steamed.

11:58.969 --> 12:01.722
<i>This</i> Family Guy <i>joke</i>
<i>was</i><i>written by Jimmy Sullivan,</i>

12:01.805 --> 12:03.599
<i>age nine, of Decatur, Georgia.</i>

12:03.682 --> 12:04.683
<i>Thanks, Jimmy!</i>

12:04.766 --> 12:08.020
<i>And we'll pass along</i>
<i>your</i><i>gross request to Mila Kunis.</i>

12:16.236 --> 12:18.322
Those footsteps are getting closer.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.949
Those aren't footsteps.
It's an old building. Just relax.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.826
Besides, I can see
an exit door right there.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.161
- Where?
- Right there.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.830
Behind that guy with the hook...

12:32.085 --> 12:33.462
Everybody run!

12:44.056 --> 12:47.226
Wait a minute.
There's four of us, and one of him.

12:47.309 --> 12:48.810
Yeah, let's get him!

12:52.731 --> 12:53.982
- Son of a bitch!
- Take that!

12:54.066 --> 12:55.943
- Die, Hook-hand!
- You won't kill us!

13:00.697 --> 13:04.785
Um, Hook-hand's name is Albert,
and he's dressed like a janitor.

13:04.868 --> 13:08.413
I've been trying to help you.

13:08.497 --> 13:11.083
I'm the caretaker here.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.585
Wait, you work here?
But you have a hook hand.

13:13.669 --> 13:18.841
I was a soldier.
I lost my hand saving six men in Korea.

13:18.924 --> 13:21.051
Oh, God, he's a war hero.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.763
He's dead.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.056
What have we done?

13:26.139 --> 13:28.100
We killed an innocent man.

13:32.771 --> 13:36.275
Well, if this doesn't justify a McFlurry,
nothing does.

13:45.367 --> 13:48.203
Oh, my God, we killed an innocent man.

13:48.287 --> 13:51.081
W-We've got to report this!
We gotta turn ourselves in!

13:51.164 --> 13:54.835
No way. If we do that,
we'll all go to jail. And I'm a cop.

13:54.918 --> 13:57.087
Do you know what they do to cops in jail?

13:57.171 --> 14:01.008
Hey, man, when you were a cop, did they...
Did they let you use the siren?

14:01.091 --> 14:02.509
Yeah, it's part of the job.

14:02.593 --> 14:03.594
That's so cool!

14:03.677 --> 14:06.555
Hey, hey, when you were a cop,
when you were going to a crime scene,

14:06.638 --> 14:08.348
did you go "chung chung,"
like <i>Law & Order?</i>

14:08.432 --> 14:10.100
No, that would be very unprofessional.

14:10.184 --> 14:11.268
All right, all right.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.978
Oh, hey, check it out, man,
when you were a cop,

14:13.061 --> 14:14.980
did you ever, you know, use your handcuffs

14:15.063 --> 14:17.107
when you were getting kinky
with your girl?

14:17.191 --> 14:18.358
No, it's city property,

14:18.442 --> 14:20.152
so you're not really
supposed to take those home.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.279
Oh, for sure, for sure.
Oh, hey, by the way,

14:22.362 --> 14:24.781
a bunch of us are gonna kill you
in the shower later.

14:28.619 --> 14:31.163
Okay, so we're all
on the same page, right?

14:31.246 --> 14:33.582
We bury the body,
we never speak of this again.

14:33.665 --> 14:34.666
- Deal.
- Got it.

14:34.750 --> 14:35.751
Yup.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.843
Wow, that was exhausting.

14:44.927 --> 14:47.179
Wait a minute, is-is that...
Is that his car?

15:00.067 --> 15:01.693
Aw, crap, it's still alive!

15:11.161 --> 15:13.872
It does not feel like a Wednesday.

15:20.838 --> 15:24.258
Peter, I'm glad you're up.
I need to talk to you about something.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.301
I know what you did last night.

15:27.553 --> 15:28.720
You do?

15:28.804 --> 15:31.515
How could you do something so heinous?

15:31.598 --> 15:35.269
Last night,
you left your dirty dishes in the sink.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.104
It's disgusting.

15:37.187 --> 15:40.399
So I did half,
and I left the other half for you.

15:42.067 --> 15:45.112
Ah, forget it. You'll just do it wrong.
I'll wash 'em myself.

15:45.195 --> 15:47.281
Why don't you just go
in the other room and relax?

15:47.364 --> 15:49.157
I'll call you when breakfast is ready.

15:49.241 --> 15:50.409
Okay.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.204
Oh, my God, Peter,
come look at the newspaper!

15:54.288 --> 15:55.706
"Janitor dead."

15:55.789 --> 15:57.833
What? No!

15:57.916 --> 16:00.961
Right here.
My college roommate, Jan Itter.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.963
She passed away yesterday.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.423
Are-are we really doing this?

16:04.506 --> 16:06.216
'Cause I didn't get, like,
any sleep last night.

16:06.300 --> 16:09.011
What are you freaking out about?
You didn't even know her.

16:09.094 --> 16:11.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
y-you're right, you're right.

16:12.306 --> 16:15.225
You and the guys
killed and buried a man?

16:15.309 --> 16:16.977
Ah, I knew you'd find out!

16:17.060 --> 16:20.022
Find out what?
I just got David Sedaris' new book,

16:20.105 --> 16:22.357
<i>You and the Guys Killed and Buried a Man.</i>

16:22.441 --> 16:23.817
Okay, I am really on edge

16:23.901 --> 16:26.153
and this thing we're doing,
I'm not happy about it,

16:26.236 --> 16:28.447
and that's a very odd title
for a humorist's book.

16:28.530 --> 16:31.033
Peter, you're acting very weird.
Just go in the other room.

16:31.116 --> 16:32.576
I don't want to go in the other room.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.369
I want to stay here
and see what you're seeing,

16:34.453 --> 16:36.788
because you're saying things
that I think are something

16:36.872 --> 16:38.749
totally different than what they are.

16:38.832 --> 16:43.045
Peter, you're gonna have a heart attack.
I won't say anything. I'll let you relax.

16:44.713 --> 16:48.342
"They found a body of a war hero
down by the old asylum!"

16:48.425 --> 16:50.219
Okay, that has to be something.

16:50.302 --> 16:51.845
- Oh, sorry, Peter,

16:51.929 --> 16:55.224
I'm just singing along
with this old John Mellencamp song.

16:55.307 --> 16:59.686
<i>They went up there to write a movie</i>

16:59.770 --> 17:03.774
<i>Peter, Quagmire, Cleveland and Joe</i>

17:03.857 --> 17:07.069
<i>Killed the old janitor war hero</i>

17:07.152 --> 17:10.072
<i>Just why, we'll never know...</i>

17:10.155 --> 17:13.825
I don't remember this one.
Guess it's never been in a car commercial.

17:13.909 --> 17:16.912
<i>In a truck that's built Dodge tough</i>

17:16.995 --> 17:18.830
Oh, yeah, no, I know this one.

17:26.380 --> 17:27.881
- Hey, Bri?
- Yeah?

17:27.965 --> 17:31.552
Aah! Damn it! Aah!
There's glass in my eye!

17:31.635 --> 17:33.428
Oh! Son of a bitch!

17:33.512 --> 17:34.721
Aah!

17:34.805 --> 17:36.306
Mom says dinner's at 6:00.

17:36.390 --> 17:38.725
She wanted me to tell people,
I don't know why.

17:44.857 --> 17:47.943
Guys, I'm kind of freaking out
about killing that guy.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.070
Anybody else have a hard time sleeping?

17:50.153 --> 17:52.197
No, but there's an old
John Mellencamp song

17:52.281 --> 17:53.824
you're not gonna believe.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.410
Wait, w-what's all this stuff
about you guys killing someone?

17:56.493 --> 17:58.912
Last night, at the asylum.
We killed that war hero.

17:58.996 --> 18:01.874
Whoa, whoa, what?
You-you really killed someone?

18:01.957 --> 18:04.251
Holy moly,
I don't think I want to hear this.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.253
Quagmire, you were there with us.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.755
You're so weird.
Last night, I was in St. Louis.

18:08.839 --> 18:10.132
I even have a picture.

18:10.215 --> 18:12.759
See that?
That's yesterday's date on that newspaper.

18:12.843 --> 18:14.511
On <i>The Quahog Informant?</i>

18:14.595 --> 18:17.264
They sell <i>The Quahog Informant</i>
in St. Louis?

18:17.347 --> 18:19.558
Well, probably,
but good luck with that whole

18:19.641 --> 18:21.768
"you three and not me killed a guy" thing.

18:21.852 --> 18:23.979
Damn it, that bastard is bailing on us.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.607
He's a worse accomplice
than Johnny Wind Chimes.

18:28.734 --> 18:30.277
Hey! Shh!

18:30.360 --> 18:32.779
Sorry! It's my chimes.

18:41.246 --> 18:43.874
I hate to frame you like this,
Quagmire, but I gotta.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.125
I can't go to jail.

18:45.209 --> 18:47.586
They'll razz me good
on account of my belly.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.926
Cleveland? What are you doing here?

18:54.009 --> 18:55.594
What are you both doing here?

18:55.677 --> 18:57.137
- Joe?
- What the hell?

18:57.221 --> 18:58.722
You backstabbers.

19:00.474 --> 19:02.100
What the hell's going on?

19:02.184 --> 19:03.477
I'll tell you what's going on.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.103
Cleveland's trying to frame me.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.564
He's got my miniature portraits
of cool guys.

19:07.648 --> 19:09.191
Peter, those are baseball cards.

19:09.274 --> 19:11.443
Whatever. He's using it
to frame me for murder!

19:11.527 --> 19:12.903
Well, I'm not the only one.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.822
Joe's got my <i>Sports Illustrated</i>
football phone.

19:15.906 --> 19:20.327
He was using this as his main phone.
It is a mess over there.

19:20.410 --> 19:23.539
Look at all you pathetic people,
bringing stuff to frame each other.

19:23.622 --> 19:26.166
- You're supposed to be friends.
- Hey, that's my shovel!

19:26.250 --> 19:29.294
Damn right! That's how smart I am.
I only had to bring one thing.

19:29.378 --> 19:31.588
This way, I can dig the hole
and just throw this in.

19:31.672 --> 19:34.842
But once you throw it in there,
how you gonna get the dirt back on top?

19:36.009 --> 19:37.010
Give me your shovel!

19:37.094 --> 19:38.595
You're gonna have to kill me first!

19:38.679 --> 19:40.764
Not with my shovel! That's brand-new!

19:40.848 --> 19:43.058
Give me back my rattle-y plastic phone!

19:51.733 --> 19:54.236
- Wait, wait, wait, guys! Guys!
- What?

19:54.319 --> 19:56.405
Don't you see? This!

19:56.488 --> 19:58.490
This is our horror movie!

20:19.094 --> 20:23.182
It doesn't feel like a Wednesday.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.436
Boy, that sucked.

20:27.519 --> 20:28.687
Yeah, I guess writing a movie

20:28.770 --> 20:30.731
isn't as easy as Joseph Gordon-Levitt
makes it look.

20:30.814 --> 20:34.610
Hey, at least we gave it a shot.
I just feel bad we killed an innocent man.

20:34.693 --> 20:37.404
Well, don't feel too bad. Look at that!

20:41.742 --> 20:42.868
Oh, my God.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.077
Wow, that's a relief!

20:44.161 --> 20:46.788
We may have actually made
this town a better place.

20:46.872 --> 20:50.459
Yeah, what a monster.
But at least now he's gone forever.
