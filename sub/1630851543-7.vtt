Penn and Teller,

They also get to perform
in Penn & Teller's

01:20.247 --> 01:23.115
world-famous Magic Spectacular.

01:23.182 --> 01:26.418
Speaking of spectacular,
here is tonight's first act.

01:29.189 --> 01:31.656
<i>- When I do magic, it's more
than just doing</i>

01:31.724 --> 01:32.924
<i>a trick for someone.</i>

01:32.992 --> 01:35.026
<i>I want to absolutely fry
their brains,</i>

01:35.094 --> 01:37.296
<i>and it doesn't matter
how hard it is to do.</i>

01:37.964 --> 01:40.265
I was booked to do
a virtual show

01:40.267 --> 01:43.302
<i>for a client out in Colorado,
over video chat.</i>

01:43.903 --> 01:46.939
<i>So I thought, "What could I do
to really blow their minds?"</i>

01:47.006 --> 01:50.442
I live in North Carolina,
which is 1,500 miles away.

01:50.509 --> 01:53.278
<i>But I saw flights to Colorado
were pretty cheap that month,</i>

01:53.345 --> 01:56.515
<i>so I flew to Colorado,
and I hid an ace of spades</i>

01:56.582 --> 01:58.417
<i>just outside of their building.</i>

01:58.484 --> 01:59.885
<i>And I flew home that day,</i>

01:59.952 --> 02:02.654
and a month later,
I did the virtual show,

02:02.721 --> 02:04.289
and I kind of closed it
by saying,

02:04.291 --> 02:06.658
<i>"Wouldn't it be cool if I
could make an ace of spades</i>

02:06.725 --> 02:08.360
<i>appear hidden somewhere
there?"</i>

02:08.961 --> 02:11.597
<i>It's a story they're still
talking about, to this day.</i>

02:12.165 --> 02:14.432
And I grabbed one of these
magazines from the back.

02:14.434 --> 02:17.636
<i>In my show, I tend to not
use typical magic props.</i>

02:17.703 --> 02:20.972
<i>I try and borrow items from
the crowd, like their phone.</i>

02:20.974 --> 02:22.974
Their wallet
or just use something

02:22.976 --> 02:25.977
<i>that you might be able
to buy at a store nearby.</i>

02:26.045 --> 02:27.779
Penn and Teller,
I'm gonna try and fool you

02:27.781 --> 02:30.382
with something you may have
lying around your own home.

02:31.184 --> 02:34.152

[cheers and applause]

02:42.261 --> 02:43.528
- Thank you.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.164
Penn, Teller, I want to
show you a piece of magic

02:46.166 --> 02:48.634
that I think
is gonna blow your minds.

02:51.237 --> 02:54.072
[blowing]

02:54.140 --> 02:55.807
Prepare to be fooled.

02:57.409 --> 02:59.678
Hmm.
[laughter]

03:01.881 --> 03:04.616
Okay. Pretty cool, but you
guys don't seem impressed.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.752
Probably because you think
I'm doing this,

03:07.853 --> 03:10.121
so I want to take it
to the next level.

03:10.123 --> 03:12.157
Alyson, would you mind
joining me here onstage?

03:12.224 --> 03:14.559
Give a round of applause
for Alyson, everyone.

03:14.627 --> 03:16.895
Alyson, I've brought
a roll of tape here.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.296
Would you mind
checking out the tape?

03:18.364 --> 03:21.499
Make sure the tape seems legit.
Like normal tape.

03:21.567 --> 03:22.701
- Yes.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.135
- And you can also check out
my fingers here.

03:24.203 --> 03:25.904
Make sure my fingers are normal,

03:25.971 --> 03:27.239
just in case Penn
and Teller think

03:27.306 --> 03:31.043
that maybe I used fake hands
for that first one.

03:31.110 --> 03:32.477
Everything seem good?
- Yeah.

03:32.544 --> 03:34.379
- All right. Everything good
with the tape, as well?

03:34.381 --> 03:35.780
- Yeah.
- All right. Cool.

03:35.848 --> 03:37.382
Only thing you need to know
about this kind of tape

03:37.449 --> 03:40.185
is it's industrial,
meaning it's super sticky.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.721
You can even feel that.
It's like maple syrup

03:42.788 --> 03:44.522
which, Penn,
I know you know a lot about.

03:44.524 --> 03:47.192
- I do.
- Check it out. My fingers.

03:47.194 --> 03:50.762
One roll of tape.
Taped together super tight.

03:50.829 --> 03:52.931
Alyson, can you give
that a couple wraparounds?

03:52.999 --> 03:55.400
Tape my fingers together
as tight as you can.

03:55.467 --> 03:58.003
- As tight as I can? Okay.
- Yeah. As tight as you can.

03:58.070 --> 04:00.472
You could even squeeze
my fingers more, if you want.

04:00.539 --> 04:03.675
- Okay. This seems bad
for your circulation.

04:03.742 --> 04:04.776
- Yeah.
I said a couple wraparounds,

04:04.843 --> 04:07.178
but this is, like, seven.
- Oh. Sorry.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.214
- No. It's all good.
It makes it more interesting.

04:09.216 --> 04:10.849
My fingers are even
changing colors, which...

04:10.916 --> 04:11.817
- Yeah. I'm...
- You can see there.

04:11.884 --> 04:12.818
It's like a second trick.

04:12.885 --> 04:14.386
- Concerned.

04:14.453 --> 04:16.121
- And so everything's
secure there?

04:16.188 --> 04:17.456
- Yes.

04:17.523 --> 04:21.493
- Alyson, I've brought
a metal ring. Check it out.

04:22.995 --> 04:25.564
One. Two.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.667
Alyson, I don't
do this on three,

04:28.734 --> 04:31.169
'cause I want you to be
surprised when it happens.

04:32.604 --> 04:35.874
- That's so cool.
- Thank you.

04:35.941 --> 04:38.677
And you see that ring
went right through my hands.

04:38.744 --> 04:41.146
- Yeah.
- We're gonna get it out.

04:41.914 --> 04:43.715
A lot of people think
the ring's gonna come out

04:43.782 --> 04:45.183
this way through the tape.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.819
It's actually gonna
come out this way.

04:51.790 --> 04:54.059
[all exclaim]

04:54.061 --> 04:55.694
- And Alyson, make sure,
one more time,

04:55.696 --> 04:57.062
my fingers are still together.

04:57.129 --> 04:58.963
It's still my fingers there.
The tape isn't broken?

04:59.031 --> 05:00.732
- No.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.467
- Thank you.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.469
Let's do it again.

05:04.537 --> 05:07.772
One. Two.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.175
[audience exclaims]
It goes right through.

05:10.242 --> 05:13.011
Now, this could be
some trick magic ring.

05:13.079 --> 05:15.013
After all, I brought it
out of my own pocket.

05:15.081 --> 05:17.215
- Right.
- Can I use your necklace?

05:17.850 --> 05:19.584
- Sure.
- I'm going to borrow it.

05:19.651 --> 05:21.820
And you are very magic,
so as far as we know,

05:21.887 --> 05:24.689
this isn't
a trick magic necklace, right?

05:24.691 --> 05:25.757
- No.
- Yeah. I know.

05:25.792 --> 05:27.492
I'm just yanking your chain.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.195
Okay.
Back to the trick. Thanks.

05:30.262 --> 05:31.396
- Okay.

05:31.464 --> 05:33.598
- If I put your necklace
on my hands like this,

05:34.633 --> 05:36.601
it kind of looks
like it went through.

05:36.668 --> 05:37.769
It's just for
the cameras though.

05:37.836 --> 05:38.937
See? It didn't really.

05:39.004 --> 05:41.540
But you'll see the moment
that it happens.

05:44.543 --> 05:46.178
[audience exclaims]

05:48.680 --> 05:50.515
- That's impressive.

05:50.583 --> 05:51.916
- You can see
that's your necklace.

05:51.984 --> 05:53.985
That ring.
Trapped in between my hands.

05:54.053 --> 05:56.988
Now, I can keep putting stuff
in my hands, over and over,

05:57.055 --> 06:00.191
but I want you to experience
this firsthand.

06:00.259 --> 06:02.527
Could you hold out your
left hand like this for me?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.262
- Yes.
- Yeah, and kind of do a

06:04.264 --> 06:06.231
A-okay. Perfect.
- Yeah.

06:06.298 --> 06:07.999
- You're gonna feel firsthand,
Alyson,

06:08.066 --> 06:10.668
how impossible it is
to pull your fingers apart.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.904
I'll avoid your fabulous
manicure, by the way.

06:12.971 --> 06:14.606
- Thanks.
- All right.

06:15.341 --> 06:17.342
This way, you can
experience firsthand that

06:17.344 --> 06:20.145
your fingers can't come apart.
Let Penn and Teller know.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.013
Is there any way
for your fingers to come apart?

06:22.015 --> 06:23.815
- No.

06:23.882 --> 06:25.917
- Penn, Teller, watch close.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.720
Alyson, it's about to get weird.

06:30.423 --> 06:32.824
Fingers forward.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.092
[imitates explosion]

06:34.159 --> 06:35.794
That's just
for hype and excitement.

06:37.362 --> 06:40.766
One. Two.

06:42.635 --> 06:44.302
[audience exclaims]

06:44.904 --> 06:47.172
Alyson, you're gonna see
that's my fingers

06:47.239 --> 06:50.175
and your fingers with the ring
with your necklace

06:50.242 --> 06:52.277
trapped in between us.

06:52.344 --> 06:54.312
- Oh, dear.
- Yeah. It's weird, right?

06:54.380 --> 06:55.780
- Yeah it is.

06:55.848 --> 06:57.516
- We're like one person
starting here connecting here.

06:58.217 --> 06:59.885
Who loves magic?
Alyson does.

07:00.752 --> 07:03.254
Yeah. I don't know about you,
but I'm having a blast.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.823
But obviously,

07:04.890 --> 07:07.759
I want to get this stuff
out of here, so Alyson...

07:07.826 --> 07:10.295
- Yeah?
- Try this.

07:10.362 --> 07:13.064
With your other hand
grab your necklace,

07:13.066 --> 07:15.333
and I want you to just
pull it out magically.

07:16.068 --> 07:18.036
[audience exclaims]
- Just like that.

07:18.103 --> 07:19.738
- What?

07:21.073 --> 07:23.274
- And you can feel the ring
on your finger.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.177
- Yes.
- We're gonna shake our hands.

07:26.245 --> 07:29.113
Just like this.

07:29.181 --> 07:30.081
We're just
gonna shake our hands...

07:30.149 --> 07:31.382
- Shake, shake, shake.

07:31.450 --> 07:32.750
- Like this. Shake. Shake.
Shake and bake.

07:32.752 --> 07:34.285
- Okay. Enough shaking.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.955
[audience exclaims]
- What?

07:37.022 --> 07:38.490
- Alyson, did you feel that?

07:38.557 --> 07:40.859
- No.
- I get that a lot.

07:40.926 --> 07:42.160
- Ew.

07:42.227 --> 07:44.229
- And you can see
we're still connected here.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.465
I take it that you're
right-handed, not left-handed?

07:46.499 --> 07:47.632
- Yes.

07:47.699 --> 07:49.000
- So we could stay
like this forever.

07:49.067 --> 07:50.835
- I have a lot of explaining
to do, but...

07:50.903 --> 07:52.303
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:52.371 --> 07:54.339
- And you've got more TV work
to do, so I tell you what.

07:54.406 --> 07:55.574
We're gonna undo ourselves.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.976
- Okay.
- I won't cover it up.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.644
Watch our hands.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.682
[audience exclaims]
- Wow!

08:03.749 --> 08:06.618
Hayden Childress.
[cheers and applause]

08:06.685 --> 08:10.455
All right. Is it hard
to stand out, in magic?

08:11.323 --> 08:12.591
- Yeah. I'd say so.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.659
I mean it's really hard
to do something different.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.495
I don't know if you've ever
had your fingers taped.

08:16.529 --> 08:18.129
I hope I was the first one.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.098
- I mean not for a magic trick.
No.

08:21.133 --> 08:24.936
I've taped 'em during crafting,
but it's usually hot glue.

08:25.004 --> 08:25.970
- Okay. Gotcha.

08:26.038 --> 08:27.038
- Yeah.
- Gotcha.

08:27.105 --> 08:28.840
- What's your favorite audience?

08:28.907 --> 08:30.942
- I love the people
who buy tickets to see me,

08:30.944 --> 08:33.512
obviously,
'cause they come in liking me.

08:33.812 --> 08:36.514
- Aww.
- Although I do kind of

08:36.516 --> 08:38.283
like the crowds who are like,

08:38.350 --> 08:40.118
"Oh, my God.
There's a magician?"

08:40.185 --> 08:43.621
'Cause I love to exceed
their expectations,

08:43.623 --> 08:44.956
if that makes sense.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:45.023 --> 08:46.825
All right, Hayden.
Let's see if Penn and Teller

08:46.892 --> 08:48.893
know the secrets
to your tape trick.

08:48.961 --> 08:50.295
- All right.

08:50.297 --> 08:53.431
- Hayden, the very definition
of packs small-plays big.

08:54.533 --> 08:56.301
What a great routine.
- Thank you.

08:56.368 --> 08:58.503
- Every moment of it
is just beautiful.

08:58.570 --> 08:59.571
You've been doing that
for a while?

08:59.638 --> 09:01.072
It seems really well-tested.

09:01.139 --> 09:03.742
- Yeah. I've been doing it
for--oh, gosh.

09:04.443 --> 09:05.977
Since I was in high school
I think.

09:06.044 --> 09:07.512
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:07.580 --> 09:10.515
- It's really a modern version
of an ancient Japanese trick.

09:10.582 --> 09:14.118
You know, the thumb tie.
And it's just done beautifully.

09:14.186 --> 09:16.287
We have seen so many people
do thumb ties,

09:16.355 --> 09:18.022
and you bring
so much more to it.

09:18.090 --> 09:20.792
Probably the most
brilliant thing

09:20.859 --> 09:24.462
is using the spectator, Alyson,
to--

09:24.464 --> 09:26.831
In the same position
you're in, so she can feel

09:26.898 --> 09:28.533
how impossible it is

09:29.134 --> 09:31.402
to get that tape off
and actually feel that,

09:31.404 --> 09:33.671
which gets
a much stronger reaction.

09:33.673 --> 09:35.406
And I don't think
I've ever seen that before.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.342
Neither one of us
can remember seeing it.

09:37.409 --> 09:40.745
You know, people do that
with other people holding stuff

09:40.747 --> 09:42.814
and things like that,
but never with them

09:42.881 --> 09:45.417
in the exact same situation
you're in.

09:45.484 --> 09:47.919
And it's really, really good,

09:47.986 --> 09:51.789
and I also love that you start
with that stupid thing

09:51.857 --> 09:54.492
that everybody does to you
when you're a magician.

09:54.494 --> 09:57.428
"Hey, can you do this?"
And then we were kind of,

09:57.430 --> 09:59.263
"Okay great. You did it.
Have fun."

09:59.265 --> 10:02.600
And then having that tie in
with the whole plot

10:02.602 --> 10:04.102
of the whole thing
is really nice.

10:04.104 --> 10:08.206
I just love how simple
and clean--and I just--I know.

10:08.273 --> 10:10.609
We have a tip for you.
Just don't ever,

10:10.643 --> 10:12.710
ever take that out
of your routine.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.245
That is just a wonderful thing

10:14.313 --> 10:16.448
that you could be known
for, forever.

10:17.015 --> 10:20.785
- Hayden, does Penn's double
talk have meaning to you?

10:20.853 --> 10:22.754
- It does. I caught it.

10:22.821 --> 10:25.456
So thank you so much
for the compliments

10:25.458 --> 10:26.491
- Well, thank you.
It's wonderful. It's just--

10:26.558 --> 10:28.059
- So you didn't fool them?

10:28.126 --> 10:29.794
- No.
You know, but that's okay.

10:29.861 --> 10:32.397
I got to hold hands
with Alyson Hannigan.

10:32.464 --> 10:33.831
That was worth
the trip to Vegas.

10:33.899 --> 10:35.299
- Aww.
- Thank you so much.

10:35.367 --> 10:36.768
- All right.
- Wonderful.

10:36.835 --> 10:39.003
- Hayden Childress.
- Thank you.

10:39.071 --> 10:41.406
- Thank you.

10:41.473 --> 10:44.142
Coming up, more of
the world's greatest magicians

10:44.209 --> 10:47.011
try to fool Penn and Teller.
Stick around.

11:01.226 --> 11:03.995
where the impossible
is always possible,

11:04.062 --> 11:05.830
especially with our next act.

11:08.633 --> 11:11.703
<i>- So this is how I used magic
to make my family appear.</i>

11:11.770 --> 11:14.639
<i>I was at this party, and I met
this girl I wanted to impress.</i>

11:14.706 --> 11:17.375
<i>And I told her I'll help her
find the love of her life.</i>

11:17.443 --> 11:19.110
<i>I asked her
to take out her phone,</i>

11:19.112 --> 11:20.578
<i>open up the calculator,</i>

11:20.646 --> 11:23.048
<i>and punch in the number
of times she'd fallen in love.</i>

11:23.782 --> 11:25.383
<i>Multiply that

11:25.385 --> 11:26.918
<i>you had your heart broken</i>

11:26.985 --> 11:28.953

<i>Then multiply that
by any random number</i>

11:31.022 --> 11:32.924
<i>that only you know.</i>

11:32.991 --> 11:36.461
<i>I told her these are the odds
of you ever finding true love,</i>

11:36.528 --> 11:38.363
<i>but what if you call
that number?</i>

11:38.430 --> 11:40.398
<i>She did, and my phone rang.</i>

11:41.967 --> 11:44.869
We've been together ever since.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.404
<i>And now, we have a little baby,</i>

11:46.472 --> 11:49.407
<i>and he's my favorite thing
in the whole world.</i>

11:49.409 --> 11:51.776
<i>So now, I'm revisiting
all my favorite baby games.</i>

11:51.843 --> 11:52.744
Ooh, ahh!

11:52.811 --> 11:53.878
<i>We play peek-a-boo, of course.</i>

11:53.945 --> 11:55.413
Peek-a-boo!

11:55.480 --> 11:56.948
<i>But also games of chance,
like rock paper scissors.</i>

11:57.015 --> 11:59.584
<i>And amazingly, he wins more
than me,</i>

11:59.586 --> 12:01.152
which got me thinking.

12:01.219 --> 12:03.388
<i>I can combine these things
into some powerful magic.</i>

12:04.756 --> 12:07.125
I can't fool my baby
with tonight's trick,

12:07.192 --> 12:10.495
but maybe, just maybe
I can fool Penn and Teller.

12:11.129 --> 12:14.232
[cheers and applause]

12:14.234 --> 12:17.702
- Here to take on Penn
and Teller is Hans.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.941
- Thank you. This evening,
I'm going to influence you.

12:24.009 --> 12:26.477
I'm going to influence
what you think, what you say,

12:26.545 --> 12:27.512
and what you do.

12:27.579 --> 12:29.547
And that happens just every day.

12:29.614 --> 12:31.249
We all get
influenced by other people.

12:31.883 --> 12:34.786
The trick is doing it
without you noticing

12:34.853 --> 12:36.320
that you're being influenced.

12:36.388 --> 12:38.890
Penn, now, for this experiment,

12:38.957 --> 12:41.326
I have sent you some stuff
across the Atlantic.

12:41.393 --> 12:43.061
Can you open up that box, Penn?

12:43.128 --> 12:44.462
- Oh, yeah.

12:44.529 --> 12:45.596
Oh, my goodness.
- Whoa.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.432
- Okay. Penn,
what do you see in there?

12:48.634 --> 12:53.404
- I see a rock. Styrofoam.
- Okay. Can you pick it up?

12:54.005 --> 12:55.406
- Pick it up?
- Pick it up.

12:55.473 --> 12:56.674
Yeah.
Pick it up. Try it.

12:56.742 --> 12:58.009
- I'll pick it up.

12:58.076 --> 12:59.343
- You're a big guy.
You can pick it up. Good.

12:59.411 --> 13:02.613
Teller, is there anything else
in there?

13:02.681 --> 13:05.016
Pick it up.
- It's rock paper scissors.

13:05.083 --> 13:06.417
- Aw.
- Scissors. Okay.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.920
Just keep the scissors.
Alyson, take a look inside,

13:08.987 --> 13:10.621
and remove--well,
you figure it out.

13:10.689 --> 13:13.625
It's paper, and sit down.

13:13.692 --> 13:16.728
And can you remove the box?
Move it away.

13:17.829 --> 13:20.231
As you can see, we have rock,
paper, scissors,

13:20.233 --> 13:21.732
as it's called.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.302
Now, rock paper scissors--
It is one of the oldest games

13:24.369 --> 13:26.004
known to mankind.

13:26.071 --> 13:28.539
It dates back to the stone age
when it was called

13:28.607 --> 13:30.041
rock rock and rock

13:30.108 --> 13:31.910
usually ending up in a tie.

13:32.611 --> 13:35.046
Now, eventually the game has
evolved to rock paper scissors,

13:35.113 --> 13:37.381
and when we play
this game in Norway

13:37.383 --> 13:39.083
we always play best
out of three.

13:39.919 --> 13:43.120
Now, today,
I'm gonna take a huge risk,

13:43.122 --> 13:45.890
and I'm gonna get this
right three out of three.

13:45.958 --> 13:48.459
And if I make one mistake,
if I get one wrong,

13:48.526 --> 13:51.262
I'm gonna thank you humbly
for your time and say goodbye.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.797
- Okay.

13:52.864 --> 13:54.499
- Now, for the first round,

13:55.667 --> 13:58.336
two of you are
going to switch items.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.205
Now, I know exactly
which two of you

14:00.272 --> 14:01.539
are going to do that switch,

14:01.607 --> 14:03.741
so I will write down
the result in advance,

14:04.509 --> 14:07.678
and Alyson, you're gonna get
the first choice here.

14:07.746 --> 14:11.616
Which two of you is
going to exchange items,

14:11.683 --> 14:12.717
in the first round?

14:12.784 --> 14:14.419
- I'm gonna trade with Penn.

14:15.053 --> 14:17.555
- You're gonna trade with Penn.
Okay. Trade with Penn.

14:19.091 --> 14:21.392
Ooh. That's heavier than
I thought it would be.

14:22.628 --> 14:26.664
- And my prediction says
Teller beats Penn.

14:26.731 --> 14:29.367
Teller's scissors
cuts Penn's paper.

14:30.535 --> 14:32.503
Now, for the second round,

14:32.571 --> 14:34.038
we're gonna do it
a bit more difficult,

14:34.105 --> 14:36.040
because now,
you can make two switches.

14:36.609 --> 14:40.077
I know exactly which two
switches you're going to make,

14:40.145 --> 14:42.580
so I'm going to write down
the results in advance.

14:43.381 --> 14:45.383
And I'm going to ask you, Penn,

14:45.450 --> 14:49.187
which two of you should make
the first switch?

14:50.522 --> 14:52.523
- Alyson and I.
- Alyson and you.

14:52.591 --> 14:54.558
Okay, switch with Alyson.

14:54.626 --> 14:57.328
- I just thought she was
getting tired holding the rock.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.330
- Yeah. Good idea.

14:59.397 --> 15:01.565
Teller, can you just
point two of you?

15:01.633 --> 15:03.167
Could you do the second switch?

15:06.005 --> 15:07.272
- Thank you.
- You switched with Alyson,

15:08.273 --> 15:12.476
and my prediction says
Alyson beats Teller.

15:12.544 --> 15:16.547
Alyson's scissors cuts Teller's
paper, and Penn beats Alyson.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.250
Penn's rock crushes
Alyson's scissors.

15:20.218 --> 15:21.386
- Wow.

15:21.453 --> 15:23.488
- Thank you.
That's what I was hoping for.

15:25.824 --> 15:27.758
And for the final round,
this is the most difficult one,

15:27.760 --> 15:30.861
because now you can make
three switches.

15:30.929 --> 15:32.363
And now,
you can try to outsmart me.

15:32.430 --> 15:35.133
For example, Penn and Teller,
if you do the first switch,

15:35.767 --> 15:37.735
for the second switch,
you can switch back again.

15:37.802 --> 15:39.203
And for the third switch,

15:39.270 --> 15:41.372
well, you can do
the same switch three times,

15:41.374 --> 15:43.040
or you can do two
different switches,

15:43.108 --> 15:46.277
or you can do
all three different switches.

15:46.345 --> 15:49.447
Whatever you think would be the
hardest for me to anticipate.

15:50.515 --> 15:52.817
And Alyson, not to put
any pressure on you,

15:52.884 --> 15:55.486
but women who are considered
very smart

15:55.553 --> 15:59.090
and very beautiful--they tend
to choose scissors over rock,

15:59.157 --> 16:02.360
in about 65% of the times.
- Wow.

16:02.427 --> 16:05.330
- Not trying to influence you
in any way, of course. Or am I?

16:06.065 --> 16:08.967
But Alyson, which two of you
should make the first switch?

16:11.002 --> 16:12.937
- Penn and Teller should switch.

16:13.004 --> 16:14.739
- Penn and Teller
do the first switch.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.543
And Penn, which two of you
should make the second switch?

16:19.611 --> 16:23.214
- I like having the rock.
Me and Teller.

16:24.116 --> 16:26.617
- And Teller, can you point
to two of you

16:26.619 --> 16:28.319
who should do the last switch?

16:31.289 --> 16:32.957
You'll switch with Penn.
Okay. Switch.

16:34.893 --> 16:39.163
Now, exactly as I thought,
and that is why

16:39.231 --> 16:42.000
there is nothing written
on this notepad,

16:42.667 --> 16:45.570
because I told you
I was gonna take a huge risk,

16:45.637 --> 16:47.171
and I did that
a couple of weeks ago

16:47.173 --> 16:51.108
when I sent you those items.
And today, I took another risk.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.910
The risk that none of you
would have that idea

16:52.978 --> 16:55.446
to look down
at that piece of paper

16:55.514 --> 16:57.548
that you have been passing
amongst you,

16:57.615 --> 16:59.250
because if you did,

17:00.419 --> 17:02.520
you could have done
one switch differently,

17:03.721 --> 17:06.124
and all my predictions
would be wrong.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.259
Penn, you figured out
what to do already.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.094
Open up and read
just the first line.

17:12.264 --> 17:13.831
What does the first line said?

17:15.534 --> 17:19.037
- Teller beats Alyson.
That's true. Penn--

17:19.071 --> 17:20.938
- Teller's rock. Yes.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.808
- Penn beats Teller.
Which is true.

17:23.875 --> 17:24.942
- Penn's--yes.

17:25.010 --> 17:27.445
- And Alyson beats Penn
which is true.

17:29.514 --> 17:30.782
- Thank you very much.

17:30.849 --> 17:33.284
- Wow.

17:33.351 --> 17:35.053
That's amazing.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.123
Hans!

17:41.226 --> 17:43.327
- Thank you, Alyson.
- That is so impressive.

17:43.394 --> 17:46.297
Were you, like,
the most annoying person

17:46.299 --> 17:49.533
to play paper rock scissors
with on the schoolyard?

17:49.535 --> 17:51.002
- I was probably
the richest one,

17:51.069 --> 17:53.071
because we would play for money.

17:53.105 --> 17:54.505
- Ooh, nice.

17:54.572 --> 17:56.774
Are there
many magicians in Norway?

17:56.841 --> 17:59.076
- Well, not many, but now,
we have a magic club,

17:59.078 --> 18:01.579
and last week,
I was elected president.

18:01.646 --> 18:05.516
It was kind of awkward though,
since I got both of the votes.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.351
The other guy knew
I voted for myself.

18:07.418 --> 18:09.787
- [laughs]

18:09.855 --> 18:11.222
Okay, Hans.

18:11.289 --> 18:15.126
Let's see if you won our game
of rock paper trophy.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.931
- Well, you certainly
blew our minds.

18:19.998 --> 18:23.000
We were just flabbergasted
right away.

18:23.068 --> 18:25.736
It's a beautiful trick.
I have been--what has it been?

18:25.803 --> 18:28.539
Like five years now.
I've been bringing up to Teller

18:28.606 --> 18:30.808
I want to do
a rock paper scissors trick.

18:30.875 --> 18:33.777
I loved it so much.
I love how simple it is.

18:33.845 --> 18:35.279
What a great game it is.

18:35.347 --> 18:37.014
I love the props being sent.

18:37.082 --> 18:40.151
I love the giant rock.
The giant scissors.

18:40.218 --> 18:42.286
The giant paper.

18:42.353 --> 18:44.221
I loved everything about this,

18:44.223 --> 18:46.624
and you're just
a great performer.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.427
The style was very clean,
turning it around.

18:49.494 --> 18:53.531
I loved it, but I do not think
you fooled us,

18:53.598 --> 18:57.301
because the way
this went seems inevitable.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.937
It seems like it's the only way
it could go.

19:00.004 --> 19:03.174
This is the only punchline
you could have,

19:03.241 --> 19:05.809
but as we know, in magic,

19:05.877 --> 19:07.445
you can always make it look

19:07.512 --> 19:10.147
like what happened
is what you wanted,

19:10.215 --> 19:11.715
even when it's not
what you wanted.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.985
So we think you didn't fool us,

19:14.052 --> 19:16.887
'cause you were using
multiple outs.

19:16.955 --> 19:19.557
You had a different way
to make everything okay,

19:19.624 --> 19:20.891
no matter what we did.

19:20.959 --> 19:22.393
- Is that right, Hans?

19:22.395 --> 19:23.661
- Does that mean, for example,

19:23.728 --> 19:25.863
you think that,
if something else happened,

19:25.931 --> 19:27.698
well maybe something
was written on the next page...

19:27.765 --> 19:28.799
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Of the notepad?

19:28.801 --> 19:30.134
- Something like that.
- So that--

19:30.202 --> 19:31.702
- A different page,
or maybe there is some answer

19:31.769 --> 19:33.971
in the box,
or something like that,

19:34.038 --> 19:36.274
and it seems inevitable,
but it really wasn't.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.909
- The outcome is what you saw.

19:37.976 --> 19:39.410
They are exactly
the same each time.

19:39.477 --> 19:41.812
There absolutely no multiple
outcomes,

19:41.879 --> 19:44.949
so I would say just-- [laughter]

19:48.353 --> 19:51.021
- Uh, yeah.

19:51.089 --> 19:52.756
Hans beats Penn.

19:52.824 --> 19:55.426
Hans beats Teller.
Hans wins the game.

19:55.493 --> 20:00.097
[cheers and applause]
- Yay! Hans, you fooled them.

20:00.164 --> 20:01.632
- We're gonna come up
and shake your hand.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.135
- Ohh.

20:04.202 --> 20:06.537
Oh, Hans.
- That's amazing.

20:06.604 --> 20:09.773
- Okay. We have a Fooler.

20:09.775 --> 20:12.643
- So beautiful.

20:12.710 --> 20:15.780
- Hans, that's awesome.
- Thank you guys.

20:15.847 --> 20:18.148
Thank you guys, except for
getting a little baby,

20:18.216 --> 20:21.652
this is the biggest thing
that happen to me.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.821
- So great, Hans. So great.

20:25.224 --> 20:31.996
- Congratulations, Hans!

20:32.063 --> 20:33.797
And we have a winner.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.766
Penn and Teller just added
an act

20:35.833 --> 20:37.735
to their Vegas magic show.

20:37.802 --> 20:40.037
Is there room
for one more on the bill?

20:40.104 --> 20:42.439
Find out when "Fool Us" returns.

20:42.507 --> 20:46.244
<i>♪ ♪</i>

20:49.981 --> 20:54.885
<i>♪ ♪</i>

20:54.953 --> 20:58.722
- Welcome back. We've seen Penn
and Teller get fooled once,

20:58.790 --> 21:00.991
but could this be
a two-Fooler night?

21:01.059 --> 21:03.794
Let's meet our next contender
and find out.

21:06.164 --> 21:09.267
- I'm Benjamin Barnes,
and my greatest power

21:09.301 --> 21:12.670
is turning "nos"
into "yeses."

21:12.737 --> 21:15.439
I found success
in my small hometown,

21:15.507 --> 21:18.175
<i>but when I first left home
to perform in Chicago,</i>

21:18.242 --> 21:20.645
<i>they booed me off the stage.</i>
[booing]

21:20.712 --> 21:22.246
<i>I was devastated.</i>

21:22.314 --> 21:24.415
<i>I threw my props in the trash,</i>

21:24.417 --> 21:26.617
<i>but I realized I had the power</i>

21:26.685 --> 21:29.386
<i>to turn that "no"
into a "yes."</i>

21:29.454 --> 21:32.189
<i>Next, I set my mind
to performing</i>

21:32.256 --> 21:35.125
<i>at one of the most
prestigious magic venues--</i>

21:35.193 --> 21:36.660
<i>The Magic Castle.</i>

21:36.728 --> 21:38.662
<i>I practiced so much</i>

21:38.664 --> 21:41.265
<i>that I strained
all the tendons in my hand,</i>

21:41.332 --> 21:44.368
<i>and I had to have surgery
to fix it.</i>

21:44.435 --> 21:46.604
But I fought my way back.

21:46.671 --> 21:49.006
<i>I know that when
most magicians ask</i>

21:49.073 --> 21:53.077
<i>if they fooled Penn and Teller
they get told "no."</i>

21:53.079 --> 21:58.849
But maybe I can turn that "no"
into a "yes" too.

21:58.917 --> 22:02.386
[cheers and applause]

22:02.453 --> 22:06.824
- Please welcome Chicago's
own Benjamin Barnes.

22:08.427 --> 22:10.161
- Hello, Penn and Teller.

22:10.228 --> 22:12.429
My name is Benjamin Barnes.

22:12.431 --> 22:17.067
International magic man
of mystery.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.269
And the piece of magic
I'll be doing tonight

22:19.337 --> 22:21.505
is truly a mystery.

22:21.507 --> 22:24.708
It works each and every time
that I do it,

22:24.710 --> 22:28.512
but I still can't
figure out how.

22:28.580 --> 22:30.414
Hopefully, the two of you

22:30.481 --> 22:32.850
won't be able to figure it out
either,

22:32.917 --> 22:35.152
but the way I see it,
no matter what,

22:35.219 --> 22:38.789
when I walk off this stage,
I'll be the winner.

22:38.856 --> 22:40.557
Because if you are able
to figure out

22:40.625 --> 22:41.925
how my magic is done,

22:41.927 --> 22:45.929
then I will have
finally learned its secret.

22:45.931 --> 22:48.999
And if you can't,
I get a "Fool Us" trophy,

22:49.001 --> 22:51.468
which would be unbelievable.

22:51.536 --> 22:53.404
Of course, I don't want
to do this alone.

22:53.471 --> 22:54.938
Alyson, will you please join me?

22:54.940 --> 22:55.939
- Yes.

22:55.941 --> 22:57.374
- Great. Hi.
- Hi.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.009
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

22:59.077 --> 23:00.411
- A pleasure.

23:00.478 --> 23:03.414
Now, Alyson, in the left hand
are the blue cards.

23:03.448 --> 23:06.049
There are 52, in total.

23:06.051 --> 23:09.219
I'll be using four.

23:09.287 --> 23:10.621
The four queens.

23:10.623 --> 23:14.992
The remaining cards
are gonna sit this game out.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.094
Now, Alyson,
I need two decks of cards.

23:17.161 --> 23:21.365
That blue deck
and this red deck of cards,

23:21.432 --> 23:24.435
also known as the mystery deck.

23:24.437 --> 23:27.371
And you might ask why.

23:27.438 --> 23:29.840
- Why?
- Here's why, Alyson.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.375
- One of the red cards

23:31.410 --> 23:34.578
is facing
in the opposite direction.

23:34.613 --> 23:38.315
It is the mystery card.

23:38.382 --> 23:39.516
Both: Ooh.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.418
- All right. We're gonna try
that part again.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.187
- Okay.
- One of the red cards

23:43.254 --> 23:45.522
is facing
in the opposite direction.

23:45.590 --> 23:48.525
It is the mystery card.

23:48.593 --> 23:49.994
- Ooh.
- Good. Good.

23:50.061 --> 23:53.764
Now, Alyson, I still need you
to pick one of these cards.

23:53.766 --> 23:57.468
I'm gonna pull cards from the
face of the pack, one by one,

23:57.535 --> 24:00.370
and I want you to focus
on the number cards.

24:00.372 --> 24:01.605
- Okay.

24:01.673 --> 24:04.274
- When you see one
that you like say, "Stop."

24:04.276 --> 24:05.876
- Okay.

24:08.579 --> 24:09.480
- Stop.

24:09.547 --> 24:10.581
- Right here?
- Yes.

24:10.648 --> 24:12.749
- All right.
Pick up the pen, Alyson,

24:12.817 --> 24:14.685
and write your initials
in large letters

24:14.752 --> 24:18.755
across the face of the card.

24:18.823 --> 24:21.091
Perfect.
Now, one of the reasons

24:21.093 --> 24:24.161
why I wanted Alyson
to focus on the number cards

24:24.163 --> 24:26.096
is because of the white space,

24:26.163 --> 24:29.600
which makes it easier for us
to see her initials there,

24:29.667 --> 24:30.934
on the four of diamonds.

24:31.002 --> 24:33.504
Now, Alyson,
what I'd like for you to do

24:33.571 --> 24:34.771
is to hold the cards.

24:34.839 --> 24:36.807
Put your other hand
right on top. Perfect.

24:36.874 --> 24:40.143
And at this time,
I'd like to remind everyone

24:40.211 --> 24:43.347
that I have the four queens.

24:43.414 --> 24:46.383
Alyson, I'm gonna place
your four of diamonds

24:46.450 --> 24:48.952
into the center
of the four queens,

24:49.020 --> 24:53.857
and Penn and Teller, it's plain
to see that's no mystery.

24:53.925 --> 24:56.793
Now, Alyson,
to make the magic work,

24:56.795 --> 25:00.331
you need to say
the mystery word.

25:00.398 --> 25:01.598
- Okay.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.267
- What is the mystery word,
you might ask?

25:03.269 --> 25:05.168
- Yes. What is the mystery
word?

25:05.236 --> 25:06.870
- I have no idea.
- Oh, dear.

25:06.872 --> 25:08.739
- Because it's a--
- Mystery!

25:08.741 --> 25:10.207
- Exactly.

25:10.275 --> 25:15.546
Alyson, I want you to think
of your very own mystery word.

25:15.613 --> 25:18.615
Don't say it.
We want to keep it a--

25:18.617 --> 25:20.084
- Mystery.

25:20.151 --> 25:22.819
- In a moment, I'm gonna extend
these five cards

25:22.887 --> 25:24.221
in Alyson's direction.

25:24.289 --> 25:26.490
Alyson, when that happens
I want you

25:26.492 --> 25:31.028
to say your mystery word
as mysteriously as you can.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.463
- Okay.

25:32.530 --> 25:35.299
- And as unbelievable as it
might sound, at that moment,

25:35.301 --> 25:39.002
one of the five cards
will vanish without a trace.

25:39.070 --> 25:39.970
- Hmm.
- You ready?

25:40.038 --> 25:41.839
- I'm ready.

25:41.906 --> 25:44.041
Cookie.

25:44.108 --> 25:45.576
- It's done.

25:45.643 --> 25:47.978
Where there were once
five cards there are now one,

25:48.046 --> 25:52.516
two, three, four queens.

25:52.584 --> 25:57.921
And Alyson, your card
has completely vanished.

25:57.989 --> 26:00.090
Where did it go? That's a--

26:00.157 --> 26:01.325
- Mystery.

26:01.327 --> 26:05.362
- Let's see if we can
solve this mystery.

26:05.364 --> 26:08.198
Alyson, raise your hand.

26:08.265 --> 26:11.468
Inside of the pack
that you've been holding onto

26:11.535 --> 26:16.273
this entire time
is a mystery card

26:16.341 --> 26:22.079
which has been there
since the very start.

26:22.146 --> 26:24.147
Penn and Teller,
you won't believe this,

26:24.149 --> 26:26.283
but the mystery card
is none other

26:26.351 --> 26:28.686
than Alyson's four of diamonds.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.455
And that is a true...

26:31.522 --> 26:33.557
both: Mystery.

26:33.624 --> 26:35.359
[cheers and applause]

26:35.426 --> 26:39.730
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Benjamin Barnes!

26:39.797 --> 26:42.966
- Fantastic.
- Oh, that was really good.

26:42.968 --> 26:44.568
- Thank you. Thank you.

26:44.636 --> 26:46.403
- I heard from Penn
and Teller Chicago

26:46.470 --> 26:48.672
is just known
for brilliant magicians.

26:48.739 --> 26:50.441
- Yes, yes. It's a long history

26:50.508 --> 26:54.378
that goes back--at
least as far back as 1898.

26:54.380 --> 26:55.712
- Wow.
- Chicago gave birth

26:55.780 --> 26:57.714
to bar magic
and what we now think of

26:57.782 --> 26:59.750
as close-up magic,
so I was very lucky...

26:59.817 --> 27:00.718
- Yeah.
- To have grown up there.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.052
- Is that intimidating though,

27:02.120 --> 27:05.422
because you have
such big shoes to fill?

27:05.489 --> 27:08.258
- No. They're there for me
to put on, you know?

27:08.325 --> 27:09.526
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:09.528 --> 27:11.629
Those people--they established
this history.

27:11.663 --> 27:14.598
They pass on to me.
I pass it on to the next.

27:14.666 --> 27:15.732
- Yeah.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.801
- This is far more intimidating.

27:17.803 --> 27:22.706
- Oh, really? What is your most
memorable performance?

27:22.774 --> 27:24.074
- One of my first shows.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.576
My first show before an audience

27:26.644 --> 27:30.013
was in a rehabilitation center
for children.

27:30.081 --> 27:31.248
- Aw.

27:31.315 --> 27:34.551
- And none of the kids
could move or talk,

27:34.618 --> 27:36.019
and I went in.

27:36.087 --> 27:38.789
I was terrified, because
I was not prepared for that,

27:38.856 --> 27:41.124
and we did the show.
And by the end of it,

27:41.126 --> 27:43.027
while they couldn't talk
they could laugh.

27:43.094 --> 27:44.228
- Aw.

27:44.295 --> 27:46.830
- They could smile,
and never forget it.

27:46.897 --> 27:49.399
- Oh, that's amazing.
- Yeah.

27:49.401 --> 27:50.867
- Okay, Benjamin. Let's see

27:50.935 --> 27:54.071
if Penn and Teller have solved
the mystery of your trick.

27:54.138 --> 27:55.973
- Let's see.
- Oh, Benjamin.

27:56.040 --> 27:58.375
Boy, good magicians
out of Chicago, huh?

27:58.377 --> 27:59.843
- Yeah.
- Really good.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.145
- Oh, yeah.

28:01.212 --> 28:02.513
- And you're one of 'em.
- Thank you very much.

28:02.580 --> 28:03.847
- You're one of the
good magicians out of Chicago.

28:03.915 --> 28:05.449
- I appreciate it.
- And I'll tell you that stuff

28:05.451 --> 28:08.351
there--neither
one of us can do any of it.

28:08.419 --> 28:10.387
You just did that beautifully.

28:10.454 --> 28:11.488
- Thank you...
- Now...

28:11.556 --> 28:12.756
- So much.
- Know--I'm sure you know

28:12.823 --> 28:16.927
very well that our mentor,
our dear friend--

28:16.994 --> 28:19.596
And he was
with the show for many years.

28:19.664 --> 28:21.031
Johnny Thompson.
- Oh, yeah.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.200
- He showed us a lot of magic.
- Yeah.

28:23.267 --> 28:25.302
- He showed us
a lot of card magic

28:25.369 --> 28:27.170
that we could not do,

28:27.238 --> 28:29.706
and he explained it to us
over and over again,

28:29.708 --> 28:32.209
and we tried,
and we just couldn't do it.

28:32.276 --> 28:36.013
And the stuff you're doing
is so, so clean there,

28:36.080 --> 28:38.348
and I'll tell you,
I love watching it.

28:38.415 --> 28:40.016
I could watch you forever,
and I know

28:40.018 --> 28:43.220
you started this whole thing
by saying you won either way.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.654
- Yeah.
- Because it was a mystery.

28:44.722 --> 28:45.723
- Yes.

28:45.757 --> 28:46.957
- And you didn't know
how it was done,

28:47.024 --> 28:49.226
and that if we could tell you
how it was done,

28:49.228 --> 28:50.627
you'd have that mystery solved.

28:50.694 --> 28:53.330
Well, I'm just not gonna
spew out how it's done.

28:53.397 --> 28:54.698
That would ruin the fun...
- Yes.

28:54.766 --> 28:56.567
- So we have made
a quick phone call.

28:56.634 --> 28:57.601
- Okay.

28:57.635 --> 28:58.969
- And we have put
the information

28:59.036 --> 29:04.141
on how this trick is done
in escrow with our law firm

29:04.208 --> 29:08.345
Hammond, Elmsley, and Elmsley,
and we count Elmsley twice.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.848
So if you want to find out
how this was done,

29:10.915 --> 29:13.650
Benjamin, you go to Hammond,
Elmsley, and Elmsley,

29:13.652 --> 29:16.453
and tell 'em Penn and Teller
left a secret

29:16.521 --> 29:18.756
from Johnny Thompson in escrow.

29:18.823 --> 29:19.890
- I'll do that.

29:19.957 --> 29:21.258

you fooled us.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.326
- I don't think so, either,

29:22.393 --> 29:23.894
but it was so awesome
to be here.

29:23.961 --> 29:24.961

- Thank you, Ben.

29:25.029 --> 29:26.062

29:56.427 --> 29:59.062
Well, you don't want
to miss this next act.

30:01.332 --> 30:03.166

30:03.168 --> 30:05.235

30:05.302 --> 30:08.572

as rival magicians.

30:08.639 --> 30:10.340
- Yeah. I was doing okay
in Northamptonshire.

30:10.407 --> 30:12.375

in Bedfordshire.

30:12.377 --> 30:14.244

working together,</i>

30:26.156 --> 30:28.291

30:38.535 --> 30:41.805
And so he said,
"Are you two a couple?"

30:41.807 --> 30:45.275

30:45.342 --> 30:47.644
"Yeah. I guess we are."

a little bit of Vegas to us.

to sit back and relax,

31:22.880 --> 31:24.814

a few days ago

31:24.882 --> 31:26.516

on Jay's phone

31:26.583 --> 31:28.118

31:28.185 --> 31:29.619

carrying the Penn and Teller

31:31.657 --> 31:34.524

and you deserve a break.

31:34.591 --> 31:37.827

the Alyson and Teller show

31:37.829 --> 31:39.562

31:39.630 --> 31:43.066

- Good thinking.

31:43.133 --> 31:44.567

You've still got a crucial role
in this brand-new venture.

at a magic convention.

36:09.600 --> 36:13.403

Perfectly done.

36:57.248 --> 36:58.982
And you've also solved
another problem,

36:59.049 --> 37:02.385

all the time

37:02.453 --> 37:06.889
that we--the three of us--wear
the same clothes every season,

37:06.957 --> 37:09.425

You've now solved that.

They can only say it about me,

Can we just keep that

38:53.430 --> 38:55.398
This is Kurt, and this is Zeke,

38:55.465 --> 38:57.834
and they are putting together
a cardboard box

38:57.836 --> 39:00.103
that will represent heaven.
Now, guys,

39:00.105 --> 39:03.306
make sure it is completely
impossible to get into.

39:03.308 --> 39:06.276
Cover every crack,
every cranny, every nook.

39:06.343 --> 39:09.278
Cover it all with tape
and with bubble wrap.

39:09.346 --> 39:12.549
Now, some say heaven
is easy to get into.

39:12.616 --> 39:14.717
Some say heaven
is hard to get into.

39:14.785 --> 39:18.588
Some say heaven is a place
on Earth, and they're right.

39:18.655 --> 39:20.323
It's right here.
That's heaven,

39:20.390 --> 39:23.292
and picture anything you want
for heaven in there.

39:23.360 --> 39:27.163
Maybe it's angels
on fluffy clouds with wings

39:27.230 --> 39:28.832
and halos playing harps.

39:28.899 --> 39:30.800
Or maybe it's my kind of heaven,

39:30.802 --> 39:33.970
which would be Sun Ra
playing Bob Dylan tunes

39:34.037 --> 39:37.707
while I eat vegan penuche fudge
and watch the Three Stooges

39:37.774 --> 39:41.878
chase a honey badger.
Now, when they said a needle

39:41.880 --> 39:44.547
they didn't mean
a modern, little needle.

39:44.615 --> 39:48.017
The Sumerian needle was
a Bedouin tentmaker's needle

39:48.019 --> 39:51.354
with a huge eye like this
for ropes to go through.

39:51.422 --> 39:55.358
And Teller will be playing
the part of the camel.

39:55.426 --> 39:57.761
[laughter]

39:59.963 --> 40:05.868
<i>♪ ♪</i>

40:05.936 --> 40:09.238
He'll also be playing
the part of the rich man,

40:09.240 --> 40:11.374
which he was, until 2020.

40:11.376 --> 40:13.342
Cover that. Come on.
Get that tape on there.

40:13.410 --> 40:16.045
Spin it around.
Get the tape all over there.

40:16.112 --> 40:19.516
It is impossible
to get into heaven there,

40:19.583 --> 40:23.319
so we're gonna show
that they are not unequal.

40:23.386 --> 40:25.354
That it is not more difficult

40:25.422 --> 40:26.689
for a rich man to go into heaven

40:26.756 --> 40:28.858
than for a camel
through the eye of the needle.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.461
They're gonna put it up
on this stand here,

40:31.528 --> 40:33.129
and then, if you would please,
Zeke,

40:33.131 --> 40:38.334
affix this needle
to the front of the box there.

40:38.336 --> 40:42.605
And cut a hole into heaven
right there.

40:42.607 --> 40:46.542
Here's the original New
Testament Sumerian text here.

40:46.610 --> 40:51.080
We have the rich man
into the kingdom of heaven

40:51.147 --> 40:55.017
not equal to the camel
through the eye of the needle.

40:55.019 --> 40:56.819
Our beef is with this symbol
right here.

40:56.887 --> 40:58.955
We think they are exactly equal,

40:59.022 --> 41:03.259
and we can prove it.
We have heaven over there.

41:03.326 --> 41:06.463
We have the needle there,
and we have our camel,

41:06.497 --> 41:08.231
and we have our rich man.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.967
We have our camel
and our rich man.

41:11.034 --> 41:12.101
We have our camel.

41:12.136 --> 41:15.438
Now, the camel has to get
all four hooves

41:15.506 --> 41:18.741
and both humps--it's
a dromedary--into the needle,

41:18.808 --> 41:20.777
at the same time

41:20.844 --> 41:27.450
that the rich man goes into
the kingdom of heaven.

41:27.452 --> 41:29.719
I think we made our point.

41:29.786 --> 41:32.489
Exactly equal.
- Wow.

41:32.523 --> 41:34.223
Well, you know the old saying,

41:34.291 --> 41:37.060
the show's not over
until the camel makes it rain.

41:37.127 --> 41:39.328
Well, the camel made it rain.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.330
We'll see you next time.
Goodnight!

41:41.332 --> 41:44.367
[cheers and applause]
