WEBVTT

01:42.208 --> 01:44.119
My name is Damon.

01:45.833 --> 01:48.370
And this is my daughter, velvet.

01:51.375 --> 01:53.366
Are you trying to plant dad?

01:53.375 --> 01:54.865
She's just turned four.

01:58.083 --> 02:00.495
Her days are spent
in a happy bubble,

02:00.500 --> 02:02.957
created by my excellent wife,
Zoe.

02:02.958 --> 02:04.619
Yeah?

02:08.500 --> 02:11.663
She's lucky enough that
her major concerns right now

02:11.667 --> 02:13.282
are numbers...

02:13.292 --> 02:16.489
Daddy. Mummy. Velly.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.411
Zoe: So how many pieces is that?

02:21.125 --> 02:23.161
Damon: How to tell
a knock knock joke...

02:23.167 --> 02:24.782
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

02:24.792 --> 02:26.657
- Unicorn.
- Unicorn who?

02:26.667 --> 02:28.999
Unicorn jump over the rainbow.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.913
Oh, that's who it is!

02:32.917 --> 02:35.659
And the elusive art of
sleep direction.

02:39.917 --> 02:42.659
But soon she'll have to
leave that happy bubble

02:42.667 --> 02:45.659
and face a rapidly
deteriorating environment.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.783
Reporter: Yes, John,
the ice sheet is now melting

02:47.792 --> 02:49.498
faster than
the scientists predicted.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.990
We're seeing large waterfalls

02:51.000 --> 02:52.536
pouring off the side of the ice.

02:52.542 --> 02:54.624
It's an alarming acceleration.

02:54.625 --> 02:56.786
Damon: The need to address this
is so urgent...

02:58.417 --> 03:00.032
That it often overwhelms me.

03:05.917 --> 03:09.614
The simplest way I can explain
our current predicament

03:09.625 --> 03:12.788
is to briefly channel
my year nine science teacher

03:12.792 --> 03:15.659
and pretend our house
is the planet.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.739
Carbon is a miraculous
building block

03:22.750 --> 03:24.286
and for millions of years,

03:24.292 --> 03:27.284
our planet has been part of
a natural carbon cycle.

03:27.292 --> 03:30.284
Some gets released,
some gets stored,

03:30.292 --> 03:31.907
and if these things
are balanced,

03:31.917 --> 03:33.782
then equilibrium is maintained.

03:35.292 --> 03:37.157
But since the
industrial revolution,

03:37.167 --> 03:39.533
we've broken the balance

03:39.542 --> 03:41.282
and have been
dramatically increasing

03:41.292 --> 03:43.658
the release of
the earth's stored carbon

03:43.667 --> 03:45.282
into our atmosphere.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.865
For hundreds of thousands of
years,

03:54.875 --> 03:59.039
we've hovered between about
180 and 280 parts per million

03:59.042 --> 04:01.784
of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere.

04:01.792 --> 04:03.657
But since the
industrial revolution,

04:03.667 --> 04:06.659
that number has shot up over 40%

04:06.667 --> 04:09.158
to more than
400 parts per million,

04:09.167 --> 04:11.624
trapping heat in our atmosphere.

04:13.625 --> 04:17.117
More than 90% of
the excess heat being trapped

04:17.125 --> 04:19.116
is absorbed by our oceans.

04:20.375 --> 04:23.867
The oceans also absorb much
of the extra carbon dioxide,

04:23.875 --> 04:30.075
and so are now 30% more acidic
than they were 150 years ago.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.699
And this is impacting
on biodiversity,

04:32.708 --> 04:37.372
as many sea creatures,
such as oysters or clams,

04:37.375 --> 04:40.242
are struggling to make
their shells.

04:40.250 --> 04:43.617
But the increased heat and
overall energy in the system

04:43.625 --> 04:46.617
also leads to more intense
weather events.

04:49.083 --> 04:51.244
Hotter air can hold
more moisture,

04:51.250 --> 04:54.367
so rainfalls, storms,
hurricanes, floods,

04:54.375 --> 04:57.082
even snowfalls
can become heavier.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.822
It is true that the climate
has always been changing.

05:04.833 --> 05:06.869
It just hasn't changed
this rapidly

05:06.875 --> 05:08.831
in at least 50 million years.

05:13.458 --> 05:16.120
Unfortunately,
the increase in heat

05:16.125 --> 05:18.867
also means that our polar caps
and glaciers

05:18.875 --> 05:20.490
are rapidly melting,

05:20.500 --> 05:22.331
which causes sea level rise

05:22.333 --> 05:24.119
that threatens
hundreds of millions of people

05:33.625 --> 05:36.116
The earth
is our collective home,

05:36.125 --> 05:39.617
but we're actually renting it
from future generations.

05:39.625 --> 05:42.458
So we need to not only rapidly
reduce our emissions...

05:43.958 --> 05:45.619
Man: Oi! Righto!

05:47.833 --> 05:49.824
But also find ways to sequester

05:49.833 --> 05:53.121
or draw down
the excess carbon dioxide

05:53.125 --> 05:55.116
that has already been
put into the system.

05:56.500 --> 06:00.322
Many scientists believe that
getting down to 350 ppm

06:00.333 --> 06:02.244
would be a terrific goal.

06:13.250 --> 06:15.741
So I think we're all
pretty aware

06:15.750 --> 06:17.957
that when it comes to
predictions of the future,

06:17.958 --> 06:20.995
they're almost entirely
negative at the moment.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.832
Any time you open your newsfeed
or social media,

06:23.833 --> 06:25.619
there's some kind of
doom and gloom story

06:25.625 --> 06:28.241
about the future of
our environment.

06:29.625 --> 06:32.241
And as a father, I...

06:32.250 --> 06:35.242
I think there's room
for a different story.

06:35.250 --> 06:37.582
A story that focuses
on the solutions

06:37.583 --> 06:39.699
to some of these problems.

06:39.708 --> 06:44.577
So my plan is to go out and
find some of these solutions

06:44.583 --> 06:47.575
and then create a vision
of a different future

06:47.583 --> 06:49.448
for our daughter.

06:49.458 --> 06:50.698
What about...

06:50.708 --> 06:52.744
Damon: I want to show her
what the world would look like

06:52.750 --> 06:56.572
if the solutions I find
were implemented today.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.746
So, what would the world
look like in 2040

06:59.750 --> 07:03.117
if we just embraced
the best that already exists?

07:04.500 --> 07:06.741
And that's my only rule.

07:06.750 --> 07:09.492
Everything I show her in
this 2040,

07:09.500 --> 07:12.822
has to exist today,
in some form.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.323
I can't make it up.

07:15.750 --> 07:18.116
- Velvet: See you, dadda.
- See you, darling.

07:22.250 --> 07:23.456
Have fun.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.832
Damon: I'm calling it
an exercise in

07:26.833 --> 07:29.199
fact-based dreaming.

07:54.583 --> 07:59.703
The first step in this exercise
was to consult the generation

07:59.708 --> 08:03.371
who'll be sharing the future
with our daughter.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.365
- Hi, everybody.
- Kids: Morning.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.240
Morning. My name is Damon.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.491
Now, do you guys know where
we've come from today?

08:10.500 --> 08:12.456
Do you know what country
that I'm from?

08:12.458 --> 08:13.368
Kids: No.

08:13.375 --> 08:15.616
We have animals called platypus.

08:17.500 --> 08:20.457
- Kangaroo.
- Kids: Australia!

08:20.458 --> 08:21.948
Australia? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:21.958 --> 08:23.869
We've been going
all around the world

08:23.875 --> 08:25.615
and talking to lots of
different children your age,

08:25.625 --> 08:27.331
and so we're going to
ask you what kind of things

08:27.333 --> 08:28.823
you want to see in the future.

08:32.042 --> 08:36.034
Well, what would make me
happy in the world is...

08:36.042 --> 08:37.532
Hmm.

08:38.792 --> 08:40.407
I think we should get
this invention

08:40.417 --> 08:45.787
which sucks up
all of the rubbish in the world

08:45.792 --> 08:49.364
and puts it in a intergalactic
dimension,

08:49.375 --> 08:51.912
which is a rubbish dimension.

08:51.917 --> 08:55.114
I'd like to see deforestation
being stopped

08:55.125 --> 08:57.992
because it's ruining the planet.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.742
Animals are losing their homes.

09:10.417 --> 09:13.909
Cleaner water. That would
really make me happy.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.161
Well, I would like for
the government

09:24.167 --> 09:28.240
to have done something on
global warming and pollution,

09:28.250 --> 09:32.664
as now, I think they're not
really doing anything about it.

09:32.667 --> 09:34.783
You know,
just be respectful to earth.

09:40.292 --> 09:43.989
It was sobering to learn
how preoccupied the kids are

09:44.000 --> 09:46.286
with the state of the planet,

09:46.292 --> 09:48.283
and what a big job
I had ahead of me.

09:49.417 --> 09:53.239
So I began my search
for solutions with energy.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.414
I found myself in Bangladesh,
where the roads are chaotic...

10:26.292 --> 10:29.034
And people are openly
peddling ice on the streets.

10:31.542 --> 10:34.124
Man: Currently, Bangladesh
has one of the largest

10:34.125 --> 10:36.036
solar home system
markets in the world.

10:36.042 --> 10:37.782
Over 5 million
solar home systems.

10:37.792 --> 10:40.624
So most households in every
rural area in Bangladesh

10:40.625 --> 10:42.115
actually has
a solar home system,

10:42.125 --> 10:43.911
and that's their primary
source of energy.

10:43.917 --> 10:45.248
Damon: Wow.

10:46.750 --> 10:51.164
This charming 23-year-old
is neel tamhane,

10:51.167 --> 10:53.874
who has studied alternative
energy technologies

10:53.875 --> 10:56.662
and come home to help
power his country.

10:58.417 --> 11:02.285
Turns out I wasn't the only one
who wanted to hear him talk.

11:04.625 --> 11:07.788
Neel: So what we do is we
interconnect solar home systems

11:07.792 --> 11:10.408
and we enable energy
sharing between them,

11:10.417 --> 11:11.907
which is basically trading,

11:11.917 --> 11:14.249
and the customer chooses
when they want to trade

11:14.250 --> 11:15.740
and when they don't.

11:17.292 --> 11:19.658
Instead of building large grids,

11:19.667 --> 11:21.908
we're proposing
a decentralised structure

11:21.917 --> 11:24.750
where we start building grids
bottom up.

11:26.917 --> 11:30.034
Damon: The setup
is quite simple.

11:30.042 --> 11:32.784
Any home that has solar panels
and a battery...

11:34.667 --> 11:36.532
Can buy this special box...

11:38.042 --> 11:39.782
Which connects them
to another house

11:39.792 --> 11:41.282
with the same setup.

11:43.250 --> 11:46.788
The box allows the buying
or selling of energy

11:46.792 --> 11:48.282
between the homes.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.998
But it gets better.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.741
Neel: There is still a segment
of the population

11:54.750 --> 11:56.741
that still can't afford to
buy a solar home system.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.286
So, instead of doing that,

11:58.292 --> 12:00.874
if they can just buy
a small solbox,

12:00.875 --> 12:02.786
they can just buy energy
when they need it.

12:02.792 --> 12:05.374
You fill up your solbox
with money.

12:05.375 --> 12:08.287
As you keep using energy,
it deducts money.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.036
Damon: What this means

12:15.042 --> 12:17.408
is that all the boxes
can connect to each other

12:17.417 --> 12:18.907
to form a microgrid.

12:20.292 --> 12:22.658
It's like a water tank
of community energy

12:22.667 --> 12:25.625
that people can give to
or take from.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.366
The beauty is that
this microgrid

12:29.375 --> 12:31.991
can then connect to the
adjacent village's microgrid

12:32.000 --> 12:34.992
and the network becomes
stronger and stronger.

12:36.542 --> 12:38.783
There's a mimicking of nature
here, isn't there?

12:38.792 --> 12:41.909
Like, in the way that
cells multiply

12:41.917 --> 12:44.374
and form something
and strengthen it.

12:44.375 --> 12:46.366
Yeah, that's a great analogy.

12:46.375 --> 12:48.661
You have one solar home system,

12:48.667 --> 12:50.749
you interconnect with your
neighbours, you make it 50.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.536
Slowly,
you interconnect villages.

12:52.542 --> 12:54.123
Once you have collected
hundreds,

12:54.125 --> 12:56.116
you can hook it up to the grid,
you can sell to the grid.

12:56.125 --> 12:57.615
Forget buying from it -

12:57.625 --> 12:59.411
you become the primary
energy generation source

12:59.417 --> 13:00.907
for the country.

13:01.917 --> 13:04.158
So the idea is
we are like a swarm of bees

13:04.167 --> 13:07.284
or a swarm of fish
that move together,

13:07.292 --> 13:10.250
pool in all our energies
together to run bigger loads.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.412
Damon: This technology
could revolutionise

13:15.417 --> 13:18.534
the way we distribute energy
worldwide.

13:20.875 --> 13:23.742
Damon: From little things,
big things grow.

13:25.417 --> 13:29.615
Man: When we have a
decentralised mode of energy,

13:29.625 --> 13:31.411
the same thing that happened
with the web,

13:31.417 --> 13:32.907
happens with information

13:32.917 --> 13:34.908
where basically,
it's Democratic.

13:34.917 --> 13:36.657
Energy becomes Democratic.

13:36.667 --> 13:39.033
But also it becomes
very efficient.

13:39.042 --> 13:40.498
It's far more efficient

13:40.500 --> 13:43.913
because you produce it at
the point where you consume it.

13:48.125 --> 13:51.288
Damon: Having efficient
local energy

13:51.292 --> 13:53.908
also provides greater resilience

13:53.917 --> 13:56.374
in an increasingly
hostile climate.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.912
Neel: And when we talk about
climate change, it's floods,

14:00.917 --> 14:04.159
it's natural disasters
that happen very often here.

14:04.167 --> 14:07.910
In the last 1.5 years, we have
seen about 5, 6 disasters.

14:11.125 --> 14:14.367
When you have a centralised
grid, everything breaks down

14:14.375 --> 14:17.242
and then it takes a long time
to build it back up.

14:20.375 --> 14:22.866
If we have decentralised
generation sources,

14:22.875 --> 14:25.412
every household has their own
generation source.

14:25.417 --> 14:26.532
They're independent

14:26.542 --> 14:28.032
and they have their power
in their own hands,

14:28.042 --> 14:29.532
instead of depending
on the government

14:29.542 --> 14:31.157
to provide it to them.

14:50.792 --> 14:54.114
Damon: The impact of the
locally-generated electricity

14:54.125 --> 14:55.911
is best seen at night.

14:58.542 --> 15:03.366
The influx of cash has made the
village bazaar the place to be.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.786
You guys have just skipped
the landline telephone.

15:42.792 --> 15:44.282
You've gone straight to
the mobile.

15:44.292 --> 15:46.783
Exactly. And it's throughout.
It's not even about energy.

15:46.792 --> 15:49.374
We skipped the grid
and we build our own.

15:49.375 --> 15:51.912
There are developing
countries like India,

15:51.917 --> 15:54.124
Bangladesh, a lot
of countries in east Africa

15:54.125 --> 15:56.491
that are trying to do
a top-down electrification.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.616
They are spending
billions of dollars here.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.115
But instead of doing that,

16:00.125 --> 16:02.537
if they can actually help
subsidise these systems

16:02.542 --> 16:04.749
and let people
own their own system,

16:04.750 --> 16:07.787
they would be so proud
by owning these.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.408
So when I'm trading energy
with you, suppose,

16:10.417 --> 16:13.739
you're actually paying me for
it, and I'm getting the money,

16:13.750 --> 16:15.866
so the money also stays
within the economy.

16:18.042 --> 16:19.748
This is bringing back people
together.

16:19.750 --> 16:22.036
Damon: Yes!

16:24.792 --> 16:29.365
As I left the village,
I had a renewed sense of hope.

16:29.375 --> 16:31.912
Particularly when neel told me

16:31.917 --> 16:34.249
this technology is springing up
in other countries.

16:38.167 --> 16:41.124
This solution is
great for our environment,

16:41.125 --> 16:44.538
with so many cascading benefits

16:44.542 --> 16:47.409
for any community
that chooses to adopt it.

16:53.792 --> 16:58.286
So, sticking to my rule of only
showing what exists today,

16:58.292 --> 17:01.409
here's what the future
of energy could look like

17:01.417 --> 17:02.907
for my daughter.

17:11.625 --> 17:13.832
This, velvet, could be you.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.240
Or this.

17:17.333 --> 17:18.993
Or even this.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.955
We love you.

17:20.958 --> 17:23.619
And this could be where
you live.

17:24.875 --> 17:26.115
Or here.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.491
Or even here.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.365
But probably not here.

17:32.375 --> 17:36.823
Darling! It's seven o'clock!
It's time for family yoga!

17:41.750 --> 17:43.456
Crystal, bring up energy.

17:44.625 --> 17:46.865
Automated voice: Certainly.
What would you like me to do?

17:48.250 --> 17:51.117
Damon: Imagine if your house
in 2040

17:51.125 --> 17:52.865
is part of a microgrid

17:52.875 --> 17:56.072
that helps power the economy
throughout your city.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.491
Imagine if your windows
are solar glass

18:04.500 --> 18:06.616
and come standard in new homes.

18:08.250 --> 18:12.448
And your solar battery
is cheap and recyclable.

18:14.458 --> 18:17.996
This could allow you to
donate your excess energy.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.956
I'm going away for four days.

18:19.958 --> 18:22.074
Crystal: Would you like to
share or sell?

18:22.083 --> 18:25.325
Share. Hurricane relief.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.369
Crystal: Done. You're a legend.

18:27.375 --> 18:29.115
Thanks.

18:29.125 --> 18:30.740
- Crystal: Humans are awesome.
- Ok.

18:30.750 --> 18:33.492
Crystal: That choice
was good for your soul.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.831
Alright.

18:35.875 --> 18:37.615
Tony: Every home
is going to have a battery

18:37.625 --> 18:40.207
that's going to store
as much electricity

18:40.208 --> 18:41.698
as it possibly can store.

18:41.708 --> 18:43.869
And all the governments
in the world

18:43.875 --> 18:45.740
cannot push back against that

18:45.750 --> 18:48.241
because folks are going to go
buy it at the store,

18:48.250 --> 18:51.367
at Ikea, at Walmart,
at the supermarket.

18:51.375 --> 18:52.865
And it's going to be very cheap.

18:52.875 --> 18:54.866
So cheap that you're not even
going to notice.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.832
Damon: If cheaper
home energy systems

19:01.833 --> 19:04.825
are combined with more people
demanding clean energy

19:04.833 --> 19:06.323
from their politicians,
darling...

19:07.750 --> 19:09.365
Then there's a chance
many countries

19:09.375 --> 19:13.368
could be close to
100% renewable by 2040.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.240
What I can guarantee

19:19.250 --> 19:21.741
is that not only will I be
an embarrassing dad...

19:21.750 --> 19:23.240
Find news.

19:24.333 --> 19:27.120
But that natural disasters
will increase their intensity

19:27.125 --> 19:28.831
over the next two decades.

19:30.458 --> 19:32.870
Man: Absolute chaos.

19:32.875 --> 19:35.582
Woman: Run, run! Get out!
Run, run!

19:38.000 --> 19:40.241
Man: God. Oh, my god!

19:41.708 --> 19:43.244
Woman: Whoa!

19:49.875 --> 19:51.456
But what I now know

19:51.458 --> 19:54.370
is that we actually have
everything we need

19:54.375 --> 19:57.117
on both a large and small-scale

19:57.125 --> 20:00.117
to power us through
these disasters.

20:01.375 --> 20:03.115
And by building new grids,

20:03.125 --> 20:06.447
loads of people
will get loads of jobs.

20:07.625 --> 20:09.365
- Oh, that's good.
- Mmm.

20:11.083 --> 20:14.871
But what would be really great
during this transition, velvet,

20:14.875 --> 20:18.072
is if the people who work
in the fossil fuel industry

20:18.083 --> 20:22.452
are given support and funding
for retraining in new careers.

20:24.083 --> 20:27.575
Paid for by redirecting some of
the $10 million a minute

20:27.583 --> 20:31.747
governments currently spend
subsidising fossil fuels.

20:56.833 --> 20:59.620
What struck me
about the microgrids

20:59.625 --> 21:02.457
is that the profits from
the shared energy

21:02.458 --> 21:05.825
stay within the community
and empower individuals,

21:05.833 --> 21:08.996
rather than going to a big
energy company elsewhere.

21:10.833 --> 21:14.075
But it turns out microgrids
are currently illegal

21:14.083 --> 21:15.573
in some countries.

21:18.083 --> 21:20.745
If we recognised
that our well-being

21:20.750 --> 21:23.332
fundamentally depends
upon the stability

21:23.333 --> 21:25.244
and the thriving of this planet,

21:25.250 --> 21:26.740
we would put that at the heart

21:26.750 --> 21:28.240
of the economic system
we create.

21:30.125 --> 21:32.616
Damon: I met with
the economist Kate raworth

21:32.625 --> 21:34.331
in an appropriate location.

21:36.250 --> 21:38.741
Kate is proposing
a new economic framework

21:38.750 --> 21:41.082
designed for our current
predicament.

21:42.500 --> 21:45.617
Today's economy,
the returns of production

21:45.625 --> 21:47.616
are accruing to a 1%,

21:47.625 --> 21:49.206
which leaves us with

21:49.208 --> 21:50.948
these extraordinary levels
of inequality.

21:50.958 --> 21:52.619
So we need to create an economy

21:52.625 --> 21:55.457
in which value created
is shared far more equitably

21:55.458 --> 21:57.244
with all those
who help create it.

21:57.250 --> 22:00.367
And daft though it sounds, I
think it looks like a doughnut.

22:00.375 --> 22:02.240
The kind with the hole
in the middle.

22:02.250 --> 22:05.083
So, in the hole in the middle
of that doughnut

22:06.625 --> 22:08.115
on life's essentials -

22:08.125 --> 22:10.241
be it food,

22:10.250 --> 22:12.115
housing,

22:12.125 --> 22:13.865
education,

22:13.875 --> 22:15.115
water,

22:15.125 --> 22:17.241
energy,

22:17.250 --> 22:20.083
and so we want to get everybody
in the world out of that hole.

22:22.250 --> 22:26.323
But we also can't go beyond
the doughnut's outer crust,

22:26.333 --> 22:28.324
because there we start to put
so much pressure

22:28.333 --> 22:29.823
on this extraordinary planet,

22:29.833 --> 22:31.573
causing climate breakdown...

22:33.250 --> 22:34.581
Biodiversity loss...

22:36.375 --> 22:37.615
Air-pollution...

22:39.083 --> 22:40.698
Too much land conversion.

22:41.625 --> 22:44.582
We kick out of kilter this
extraordinary living planet

22:44.583 --> 22:46.448
on which all of our well-being
depends.

22:49.750 --> 22:52.116
Last century's economists
didn't see this.

22:52.125 --> 22:54.867
No phase of humanity
has encountered this before.

22:54.875 --> 22:57.241
It's our generational challenge.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.865
We need new ideas to do this.

23:01.875 --> 23:05.572
The wonderful thing about
the microgrids

23:05.583 --> 23:08.871
is that they fit beautifully
within the doughnut framework.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.242
The solar energy helps restore
the outer boundaries

23:13.250 --> 23:14.740
like climate change...

23:15.833 --> 23:17.243
And air-pollution...

23:18.750 --> 23:20.456
But on the inner boundaries,

23:20.458 --> 23:23.370
more people are pulled
into the doughnut

23:23.375 --> 23:26.242
by improving health,
with less kerosene use...

23:27.583 --> 23:30.450
Education, by providing light
to study...

23:31.958 --> 23:33.243
Income equality,

23:33.250 --> 23:35.457
by keeping profits within
the local economy...

23:36.750 --> 23:38.115
And networks,

23:38.125 --> 23:41.197
because the microgrid now
interconnects households.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.618
I am going to invent a plane
and...

24:00.625 --> 24:02.616
You type in the coordinates
where...

24:02.625 --> 24:06.743
What you want it... where you
want it to go and...

24:06.750 --> 24:09.617
In a split second, you're there.

24:09.625 --> 24:12.332
I think electric cars
would help the environment

24:12.333 --> 24:14.619
because that causes
less pollution.

24:14.625 --> 24:19.369
And maybe, um, get electric
cars if they can, um,

24:19.375 --> 24:21.866
'cause that reduces,
like, fossil fuels

24:21.875 --> 24:23.866
and then that also stops
global warming.

24:23.875 --> 24:25.615
And instead of using cars,

24:25.625 --> 24:27.866
I would like to use
rocket boots to go around

24:27.875 --> 24:30.082
and they would be
powered by plants.

24:30.083 --> 24:32.870
Oh, that would be so cool.
That would be awesome.

24:32.875 --> 24:34.331
And rocket boots, I think,

24:34.333 --> 24:37.746
would really cool to see people
flying around the city in.

24:37.750 --> 24:39.832
And also I want it to go
worldwide

24:39.833 --> 24:41.869
and I want to try
and invent them.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.456
Damon: So, it's interesting

24:51.458 --> 24:53.494
being in some of these
big American cities,

24:53.500 --> 24:55.115
the traffic is just diabolical.

24:55.125 --> 24:56.956
And I can see that it...

24:56.958 --> 24:59.825
You know, I consider myself
quite a happy person, you know.

24:59.833 --> 25:01.744
I've got not a lot to
complain about.

25:02.875 --> 25:04.365
But I'm really...

25:05.833 --> 25:09.451
Feeling a bit antsy
in this traffic and, um...

25:09.458 --> 25:10.868
It kind of does that to you.

25:10.875 --> 25:13.867
And I think probably
a lot of people

25:13.875 --> 25:15.991
might not put that as a factor

25:16.000 --> 25:17.865
because they've got other
things going on in their life,

25:17.875 --> 25:19.365
but if you do have things
in your life

25:19.375 --> 25:20.865
that are bothering you,

25:20.875 --> 25:22.957
then you throw yourself
into this environment...

25:22.958 --> 25:24.619
Things can get a little tense.

25:24.625 --> 25:26.616
And I've been tempted to
jump on the horn

25:26.625 --> 25:28.365
and abuse couple of people.

25:36.375 --> 25:38.081
In the us right now,

25:38.083 --> 25:41.871
road vehicles contribute
to 20% of emissions.

25:44.750 --> 25:48.993
But our environment and sanity
will be severely tested

25:49.000 --> 25:52.117
with predictions of an extra
one billion cars worldwide

25:52.125 --> 25:53.615
by 2040.

25:53.625 --> 25:54.865
J here in my car

25:54.875 --> 25:56.740
j I feel safest of all

25:56.750 --> 25:58.706
j I can lock all my doors... j&

25:58.708 --> 26:02.747
a possible solution could be
replacing car ownership

26:02.750 --> 26:05.332
with on-demand
driverless vehicles.

26:08.875 --> 26:12.367
The same way that we
went from owning DVDs or cds

26:12.375 --> 26:13.956
or records or whatever,

26:13.958 --> 26:16.119
to having all of those
on demand -

26:16.125 --> 26:18.332
essentially Netflix and so on -

26:18.333 --> 26:21.996
the same thing is going to
happen with transportation.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.366
Damon: I wasn't sure I'd trust
a driverless car

26:26.375 --> 26:28.206
with my daughter,

26:28.208 --> 26:29.869
so I subjected this prototype

26:29.875 --> 26:32.366
to the surprise pedestrian test.

26:35.083 --> 26:36.948
Ah! Yes!

26:38.750 --> 26:40.957
Robots - 1, human - 0.

26:43.500 --> 26:46.116
The next test was
a little more challenging.

26:47.250 --> 26:48.615
Traffic.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.365
When I push this button,

26:51.375 --> 26:53.491
this car will be driving itself.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.365
And, um, wish me luck.

27:03.833 --> 27:05.118
Right.

27:07.875 --> 27:11.447
So, this is my first experience
in a driverless vehicle,

27:11.458 --> 27:12.823
and, uh...

27:14.458 --> 27:15.994
I'm a little bit nervous

27:16.000 --> 27:17.991
because that wheel
is turning by itself.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.456
Siri, please look after me.

27:22.833 --> 27:25.620
So, yeah, you can see
that's our car tracking there,

27:25.625 --> 27:28.492
and the little lidar,
the radar on top

27:28.500 --> 27:30.456
is reading out
all the information

27:30.458 --> 27:32.870
I think, about 50m ahead of us

27:32.875 --> 27:36.743
and scanning the area and
determining what's around us,

27:36.750 --> 27:39.241
what other obstacles,
what it should look out for -

27:39.250 --> 27:42.617
pedestrians, bike riders,
other cars.

27:42.625 --> 27:44.991
So it's constantly
ahead of us, predicting.

27:46.375 --> 27:48.491
Tony: Two things
are going to happen.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.367
We're all going to have
a massive fleet of cars

27:51.375 --> 27:54.367
that are going to pick you
up at home, take you to work,

27:54.375 --> 27:56.331
take you to the supermarket
and so on,

27:56.333 --> 27:57.869
and the other one -

27:57.875 --> 28:01.948
even if you already own a car
that you already paid off,

28:01.958 --> 28:05.621
it's going to be four times
more expensive

28:05.625 --> 28:07.866
just to own that car

28:07.875 --> 28:10.617
than it is to access
transportation as a service,

28:10.625 --> 28:12.490
so, autonomous
electric vehicles.

28:16.583 --> 28:19.746
Damon: I do like the freedom
of my own car,

28:19.750 --> 28:21.615
so the big question is

28:21.625 --> 28:23.866
are enough of us
willing to give that up

28:23.875 --> 28:26.332
and embrace shared
transportation?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.490
One of the interesting
challenges

28:29.500 --> 28:32.367
about a future of vehicles
that involves ridesharing,

28:32.375 --> 28:34.582
is that we have all these ideas
tied up with owning vehicles

28:34.583 --> 28:36.073
that have very little to do with

28:36.083 --> 28:37.493
getting us from
point a to point b,

28:37.500 --> 28:40.207
and all to do with what those
things said about us.

28:40.208 --> 28:42.995
So, you know, they became
symbols of independence

28:43.000 --> 28:44.365
and freedom.

28:44.375 --> 28:47.822
They became symbols of class
and wealth and capital.

28:47.833 --> 28:50.870
Now, the reality is, of course,
we haven't had cars forever.

28:50.875 --> 28:52.866
And the notion of cars
as status symbols

28:52.875 --> 28:54.365
and signals of independence -

28:54.375 --> 28:56.331
that's 60, 70 years old,
at most,

28:56.333 --> 28:58.119
and less than that
in most places.

28:58.125 --> 29:02.118
And so the idea that we
can uncouple those things

29:02.125 --> 29:03.365
isn't impossible.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.331
And frankly, they only ever got
coupled in the first place

29:05.333 --> 29:06.869
because of advertising.

29:09.625 --> 29:13.368
Damon: If we did embrace
on-demand transport,

29:13.375 --> 29:17.118
much like we now require
fewer cds or DVDs...

29:19.125 --> 29:21.241
We'd also require
fewer vehicles...

29:24.083 --> 29:26.369
And almost no parking space.

29:30.125 --> 29:34.494
Tony: Two thirds of la
is parking and roads.

29:35.583 --> 29:39.622
You could fit three cities
the size of San Francisco

29:39.625 --> 29:42.367
in the empty parking space

29:42.375 --> 29:46.243
left by the autonomous vehicle
disruption.

29:47.333 --> 29:50.450
And so, as a society,
we need to make decisions.

29:50.458 --> 29:52.744
What do we do
with all that parking space

29:52.750 --> 29:54.615
that's going to be vacant?

29:59.875 --> 30:03.242
So, here's what 2040 could
look like for my daughter

30:03.250 --> 30:06.083
without an extra billion cars.

30:14.583 --> 30:16.869
As you head off to your first
school dance, velvet...

30:16.875 --> 30:18.957
Family hug. Family hug.

30:18.958 --> 30:20.698
It will be nice
not having to worry

30:20.708 --> 30:22.448
about your date's
driving skills.

30:24.125 --> 30:28.994
Look, dad! A ghost must be
driving! Spooky!

30:33.125 --> 30:35.116
I imagine your date
to be very kind.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.081
And very impotent.

30:41.583 --> 30:43.574
All the cars that
your mum and I ever owned

30:43.583 --> 30:45.244
were stranded assets,

30:45.250 --> 30:49.368
meaning that 96% of the time
they were parked or unused.

30:49.375 --> 30:50.956
But now, in 2040,

30:50.958 --> 30:54.246
with driver costs gone
and the rideshare explosion,

30:54.250 --> 30:56.957
fewer people actually own cars.

30:56.958 --> 31:00.121
They get around in
luxurious pods like this

31:00.125 --> 31:01.990
for next to nothing.

31:03.458 --> 31:06.825
It's just inner cities that are
likely to be driverless only.

31:07.875 --> 31:09.866
And we could really
fatten the doughnut

31:09.875 --> 31:11.957
if vehicles were
community-owned.

31:17.250 --> 31:18.865
But I secretly hope, darling,

31:18.875 --> 31:21.742
that rocket boots girl
has achieved her ambition

31:21.750 --> 31:24.457
of worldwide domination.

31:24.458 --> 31:26.369
Reporter: So, this is
a huge disruption

31:26.375 --> 31:29.082
of a massive part of
the labour force.

31:29.083 --> 31:32.246
Damon: Inevitably, there'll be
debates around this technology.

31:33.500 --> 31:36.332
But if enough of us
embrace ridesharing,

31:36.333 --> 31:40.872
we could reclaim our cities
for humans instead of vehicles,

31:40.875 --> 31:43.491
and generate
millions of new jobs.

32:00.958 --> 32:02.949
Kate: This is big vision.

32:02.958 --> 32:05.370
We just need to have
that vision now.

32:05.375 --> 32:07.616
A lot of people want to be
working on something

32:07.625 --> 32:09.616
that they can see is actually
helping to regenerate

32:09.625 --> 32:12.367
and innovatively
recreate the world.

32:16.250 --> 32:19.492
Damon: The extra space in our
cities could allow the building

32:19.500 --> 32:22.242
of more low-cost
sustainable homes.

32:25.625 --> 32:30.449
And we could see the growth
of remanufacturing industries,

32:30.458 --> 32:33.450
which might convert
existing vehicles to electric.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.117
But most exciting could be
the urban food farms

32:41.125 --> 32:43.241
that spring up
in empty parking lots.

32:46.125 --> 32:48.366
Or inside disused car parks.

32:50.708 --> 32:54.246
And imagine having fresh local
food growing on our rooftops.

32:57.500 --> 33:01.493
This would also contribute to
a much healthier environment.

33:03.375 --> 33:05.741
Man: It's unbeatable to grow
food in your own backyard.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.240
It's unbeatable to grow food

33:07.250 --> 33:09.081
all through and around
your city.

33:09.083 --> 33:12.371
It's unbeatable to grow
food on your roof.

33:12.375 --> 33:17.449
Those are the absolute
gold standard of emissions.

33:21.125 --> 33:23.957
Damon: One day you will be
amazed by the distances

33:23.958 --> 33:25.869
some of our food travelled.

33:28.333 --> 33:30.198
Velvet: Bring up data for 2016.

33:31.625 --> 33:36.073
In 2016, the us was importing
the same amount of beef

33:36.083 --> 33:37.698
as it was exporting.

33:43.375 --> 33:46.492
Fish caught in Norway was flown
to China for filleting.

33:48.583 --> 33:50.824
Then flown back to Norway
to be sold.

33:53.125 --> 33:54.740
What were you guys thinking?

33:55.750 --> 33:57.240
Well, sometimes we weren't.

33:58.333 --> 33:59.994
But how's this?

34:01.083 --> 34:03.620
If we electrify
our transport systems

34:03.625 --> 34:06.241
and frankly, make them
far more attractive...

34:07.500 --> 34:10.867
A lot more fossil fuels
will stay in the ground.

34:12.125 --> 34:13.614
If nobody's going to buy

34:13.625 --> 34:15.741
internal combustion engine
petrol cars,

34:15.750 --> 34:17.866
nobody's going to buy oil.

34:17.875 --> 34:22.744
What we see is that oil demand
is going to peak

34:22.750 --> 34:26.413
and it's going to
go down dramatically.

34:26.417 --> 34:28.157
And it's never coming back.

34:30.417 --> 34:33.864
Damon: This means areas like
the tar sands oil fields

34:33.875 --> 34:36.786
could be magnificently
transformed.

34:46.417 --> 34:49.659
If you do choose to
live in a city, velvet,

34:49.667 --> 34:51.282
I hope it's a bit like this.

34:54.875 --> 34:57.912
A city where
so many of the public parks,

34:57.917 --> 35:03.116
urban food projects
and cleaner transport networks,

35:03.125 --> 35:05.992
all contribute to
a healthier environment,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.412
while fostering a greater sense
of community..

35:10.042 --> 35:12.408
And a hell of a lot less
road rage.

35:21.625 --> 35:23.115
But the bonus

35:23.125 --> 35:26.288
is that you can now actually
hear birds singing

35:26.292 --> 35:27.998
in the middle of the city.

35:40.667 --> 35:43.534
As wonderful as
this future could be,

35:43.542 --> 35:46.909
I was pretty gobsmacked
to learn that vested interests

35:46.917 --> 35:49.909
now spend almost
$1 billion a year

35:49.917 --> 35:52.750
preventing us from actually
lowering our emissions.

35:56.417 --> 35:58.624
So, the fossil fuel industry

35:58.625 --> 36:00.411
have being doing
a magnificent job

36:00.417 --> 36:02.874
at copying the tobacco playbook

36:02.875 --> 36:06.288
in creating doubt and confusion
amongst the public.

36:06.292 --> 36:08.658
And I've been following
some of their key players,

36:08.667 --> 36:10.749
their sneaky players, online,

36:10.750 --> 36:12.286
just to try and learn
and understand

36:12.292 --> 36:13.782
some of the tactics.

36:13.792 --> 36:15.282
So, one of the things they do

36:15.292 --> 36:16.782
is that they create websites

36:16.792 --> 36:18.999
that sound and look
very Sincere,

36:19.000 --> 36:20.911
but are full of misinformation.

36:20.917 --> 36:24.489
You see here the innocent
hummingbird, the leaf.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.161
They'll also fund think tanks

36:26.167 --> 36:28.249
that come up with really clever
cultural memes

36:31.417 --> 36:33.533
and these are things like,
you know,

36:33.542 --> 36:35.248
"climate science isn't settled",

36:35.250 --> 36:37.411
which is ripped
straight from tobacco.

36:37.417 --> 36:38.907
Or "climate change
is a religion".

36:38.917 --> 36:40.657
That's another one.
It's very evocative.

36:40.667 --> 36:43.499
They'll also used fake bots
or algorithms

36:43.500 --> 36:46.037
that appear to be humans
on social media,

36:46.042 --> 36:47.998
and what this does
is creates a sense

36:48.000 --> 36:50.912
that they have more support
than they actually do.

36:50.917 --> 36:54.364
And this one's pretty key
because companies like exxon

36:54.375 --> 36:56.912
will often fund lots of
different organisations

36:56.917 --> 36:58.407
to make it look like

36:58.417 --> 37:00.282
there's this wide consensus
of climate denial,

37:00.292 --> 37:01.782
whereas in actual fact,

37:01.792 --> 37:03.748
all those different
organisations

37:03.750 --> 37:06.287
were funded by the same source.

37:09.917 --> 37:13.159
These tactics have focused
the conversation

37:13.167 --> 37:15.783
primarily on our emissions,

37:15.792 --> 37:19.410
while obscuring a crucial
component of our dilemma.

37:21.625 --> 37:24.287
If we ceased
all emissions today,

37:24.292 --> 37:26.157
if we cut emissions to zero,

37:26.167 --> 37:27.782
human emissions to zero,

37:27.792 --> 37:29.373
we would still be toast.

37:29.375 --> 37:31.741
We're still already over
a tipping point

37:31.750 --> 37:34.412
and on our way
to a point of no return.

37:34.417 --> 37:36.408
So we have to reduce
the emissions

37:36.417 --> 37:38.499
that we're producing today,

37:38.500 --> 37:41.162
and we also have to
sequester carbon

37:41.167 --> 37:43.999
and we have to remove excess
carbon from the atmosphere

37:44.000 --> 37:45.490
and store it.

37:50.917 --> 37:52.999
With an increased sense
of urgency,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.742
I met with Paul hawken,

37:55.750 --> 37:58.036
who thankfully
isn't afraid of heights.

37:59.667 --> 38:02.739
He's the founder of
project drawdown -

38:02.750 --> 38:06.789
the first comprehensive plan
to reverse global warming.

38:08.417 --> 38:12.365
If you look at the solutions
that we model in drawdown,

38:12.375 --> 38:14.866
they're virtually all
regenerative development.

38:14.875 --> 38:17.537
That is to say
the earth is better off,

38:17.542 --> 38:20.158
the people are better off,
the communities are better off,

38:20.167 --> 38:22.032
the creatures are better off,
the birds are better off.

38:22.042 --> 38:24.749
No matter what it is,
they're better off for it

38:24.750 --> 38:26.411
than had we not done it.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.868
Paul suggested I first explore
food and agriculture

38:32.875 --> 38:35.537
for drawdown opportunities.

38:35.542 --> 38:38.784
When you change agriculture
practices related to food,

38:38.792 --> 38:40.282
you can do two things.

38:40.292 --> 38:43.739
One is you stop emitting
carbon, co2,

38:43.750 --> 38:46.913
but you're also
sequestering carbon.

38:46.917 --> 38:49.283
So it's one of those sectors...
Yeah!

38:49.292 --> 38:51.499
That actually does both -
it's a twofer.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.491
Which is... not only does it
stop putting it up,

38:53.500 --> 38:54.990
but it actually brings it down.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.616
So you're flipping
a whole sector.

38:59.167 --> 39:02.534
Yeah, I think that people
should be eating

39:02.542 --> 39:05.659
more fruit and vegetable
and less sweet stuff

39:05.667 --> 39:09.910
and so that the sweet
stuff should be, um...

39:09.917 --> 39:12.408
Like, you should be rationed
on sweet stuff.

39:12.417 --> 39:13.907
When I grow up,

39:13.917 --> 39:17.785
I want it to be national
hot dog day every day.

39:17.792 --> 39:21.284
I want to see more trees

39:21.292 --> 39:26.616
and also want to see chocolate
raining from the clouds.

39:28.292 --> 39:30.408
Be more healthy.

39:30.417 --> 39:33.409
That's all I really have to
say about the food.

39:33.417 --> 39:36.784
Like, I wanted not so much
people eating meat

39:36.792 --> 39:38.407
because that's animals.

39:38.417 --> 39:39.907
But I do like bacon.

39:39.917 --> 39:41.373
Bacon's nice.

39:42.542 --> 39:44.032
But...

39:44.042 --> 39:47.739
It still, like, pigs
and I have a pig toy.

39:47.750 --> 39:50.913
And when I eat bacon,
I feel kind of sad.

40:02.750 --> 40:05.412
Man: Soil's almost
an unknown universe

40:05.417 --> 40:09.285
in that there's
over 6 billion microorganisms

40:09.292 --> 40:11.123
of huge diversity

40:11.125 --> 40:14.413
in a small spoonful of soil,
of healthy soil.

40:14.417 --> 40:16.533
Which is really quite amazing.

40:16.542 --> 40:18.908
Don't know who counted them,
but someone did.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.408
It's a tough job. Yeah.

40:25.667 --> 40:30.991
I was in regional Victoria
in Australia to meet col seis,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.412
a champion of
regenerative agriculture.

40:35.042 --> 40:37.909
In 1979, we had a major
bushfire at home.

40:37.917 --> 40:40.033
Like... a wildfire.

40:40.042 --> 40:42.658
And lost virtually
all of our sheep,

40:42.667 --> 40:44.783
which were 3,000 merino sheep.

40:44.792 --> 40:49.411
I went from going ok
to being broke overnight.

40:49.417 --> 40:50.907
So I had to work out
a way of doing it

40:50.917 --> 40:52.407
without spending any money.

40:52.417 --> 40:55.284
And I developed
a different way of farming,

40:55.292 --> 40:56.532
totally different,

40:56.542 --> 40:59.409
through 1980s and 1990s,

40:59.417 --> 41:02.159
which turned out to
regenerate the land.

41:02.167 --> 41:04.499
Damon: Using a lot less
chemicals and inputs

41:04.500 --> 41:06.161
than is traditionally used.

41:06.167 --> 41:07.998
That's right.
And since I changed -

41:08.000 --> 41:09.410
I actually did the figures
on it -

41:09.417 --> 41:13.865
I've saved over $2 million,
since I changed.

41:13.875 --> 41:15.615
I don't go where
the $2 million went.

41:20.417 --> 41:23.374
Col helps farmers around
the world use plants

41:23.375 --> 41:25.661
to pull carbon from
the atmosphere

41:25.667 --> 41:27.157
and put it into their soil...

41:28.792 --> 41:31.124
Because our constant
ploughing of the soil

41:31.125 --> 41:33.366
has released billions of
tonnes of the stuff.

41:35.417 --> 41:38.784
Eric: Over the last
10,000 years of agriculture,

41:38.792 --> 41:40.373
the degradation of soils

41:40.375 --> 41:44.368
has been one of the leading
causes of climate change.

41:44.375 --> 41:46.411
It's actually, as of right now,

41:46.417 --> 41:48.373
a larger cause of climate change

41:48.375 --> 41:50.286
than burning fossil fuels.

41:54.792 --> 41:58.159
Damon: I asked col to strike
a farming calendar pose

41:58.167 --> 42:00.374
to explain how he brings
the carbon back home.

42:03.417 --> 42:06.784
Plants use carbon dioxide
and energy from the sun

42:06.792 --> 42:08.623
to create simple sugars.

42:10.417 --> 42:12.999
The plant uses
some of these sugars to grow.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.912
The rest is pumped into
the soil, through the roots.

42:17.042 --> 42:19.624
These sugars feed soil microbes,

42:19.625 --> 42:21.741
which interact with the plant

42:21.750 --> 42:24.742
and the carbon dioxide
taken from the atmosphere

42:24.750 --> 42:27.617
is sequestered into the soil
as carbon.

42:34.792 --> 42:36.282
- Man: G'day!
- Fraser.

42:36.292 --> 42:37.782
- Hey, Damon.
- Nice to meet you, mate.

42:37.792 --> 42:39.282
- You too.
- How you going?

42:39.292 --> 42:41.499
- Very well. G'day. Col.
- G'day.

42:44.042 --> 42:46.374
Woman: We went to
take the kids fishing

42:46.375 --> 42:49.492
and we had to go and find worms
on the farm

42:49.500 --> 42:52.992
and Fraser was just going from
paddock to paddock

42:53.000 --> 42:54.536
trying to find worms.

42:54.542 --> 42:56.282
- There wasn't any.
- There was none.

42:56.292 --> 42:57.782
And it ended up...

42:57.792 --> 42:59.657
This fun experience
ended up being not so fun

42:59.667 --> 43:01.157
because there was
so much frustration

43:01.167 --> 43:03.874
about how come there weren't
any worms and...

43:03.875 --> 43:05.615
'Cause healthy soil has worms.

43:07.375 --> 43:09.616
Fraser: We had everything
going for our farm

43:09.625 --> 43:12.037
and I didn't feel that
it was getting the yields

43:12.042 --> 43:13.748
and getting the results that,
you know,

43:13.750 --> 43:15.411
I thought were going
to be there.

43:15.417 --> 43:18.784
And I tried just throwing
more fertiliser at it

43:18.792 --> 43:20.373
and that didn't seem to work.

43:20.375 --> 43:22.036
And so I just had
all these questions

43:22.042 --> 43:25.910
around what we were doing
and why we were doing it.

43:28.625 --> 43:30.365
So, what's going on here,
fellas?

43:30.375 --> 43:33.867
So, this is what we call
a chemical summer fallow.

43:33.875 --> 43:34.910
Damon: Yep.

43:34.917 --> 43:36.407
Fraser: Where we control
the weeds

43:36.417 --> 43:37.873
with a chemical over summer.

43:37.875 --> 43:39.365
So, how does that
affect the soil,

43:39.375 --> 43:41.286
like, in terms of the...

43:41.292 --> 43:43.032
Colin: This form of agriculture

43:43.042 --> 43:45.499
really kills
the whole soil ecosystem.

43:47.667 --> 43:49.908
Fraser: So, what are we
looking at there, col?

43:49.917 --> 43:53.114
Colin: That hard compaction,
poor-structured soil

43:53.125 --> 43:55.912
is really not good
in agriculture.

43:55.917 --> 43:58.249
Like, if you think about a plant

43:58.250 --> 44:01.788
trying to get through that,
it's almost impossible. Um...

44:01.792 --> 44:04.624
The other thing too,
water can't get in there.

44:04.625 --> 44:06.911
Damon: To counteract
these problems,

44:06.917 --> 44:10.910
col's simple advice to Fraser
was to start planting.

44:13.417 --> 44:14.907
Ok, so what we've done here

44:14.917 --> 44:17.533
is planted a mix of
different species.

44:17.542 --> 44:19.032
About 80 in total.

44:20.125 --> 44:23.288
They all play a role
in the soil health,

44:23.292 --> 44:25.032
with their different roots

44:25.042 --> 44:27.499
and their different
root exudates.

44:27.500 --> 44:32.415
So we've got the sunflower here
and the sorghum.

44:32.417 --> 44:35.033
- Um, millet.
- Damon: Yeah, right.

44:35.042 --> 44:36.407
Down here.

44:36.417 --> 44:38.749
Damon: And all these together
means with that variety,

44:38.750 --> 44:40.240
it's making the soil...

44:40.250 --> 44:41.740
It's pulling the carbon
into the soil

44:41.750 --> 44:42.990
and making it healthier.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.661
That's right. Yeah. Exactly.

44:44.667 --> 44:46.532
- Damon: Go, nature!
- Fraser: Yeah.

44:57.750 --> 45:01.288
Colin: If we go back even
a few thousand years,

45:01.292 --> 45:02.998
all of the grasslands
in the world

45:03.000 --> 45:06.538
were dominated by large mobs of
grazing animals.

45:09.042 --> 45:14.241
And also, they were kept moving
all the time by predators.

45:14.250 --> 45:16.036
So the animals -
in this case, cattle -

45:16.042 --> 45:18.499
are never kept on
the same area at one time.

45:20.667 --> 45:23.283
Damon: By letting the cattle
run amok in the crops,

45:23.292 --> 45:25.248
good things happen.

45:26.292 --> 45:29.159
They flatten the field,

45:29.167 --> 45:32.239
they create a utopia
for the local insects

45:32.250 --> 45:34.411
which becomes
a natural fertiliser,

45:34.417 --> 45:39.286
and crucially, they are fed
as nature intended.

45:42.417 --> 45:44.032
Colin: Over the last
50 or 60 years,

45:44.042 --> 45:47.409
we've removed animals
like cattle and sheep

45:47.417 --> 45:49.408
from eating their natural food

45:49.417 --> 45:52.124
and put them in feedlots,
eating grain.

45:52.125 --> 45:53.535
And we should
never have done that

45:53.542 --> 45:55.624
because they have never
evolved to eat grain.

45:57.042 --> 45:59.909
So what happens is that
the cattle are basically sick.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.367
And we are finding out now
that the meat from feedlots

46:04.375 --> 46:05.911
is not healthy for us.

46:05.917 --> 46:08.283
It's certainly not healthy
for the animals.

46:08.292 --> 46:11.284
And it's something that
we should never have done.

46:14.667 --> 46:16.749
Damon: Any discussion
around livestock

46:16.750 --> 46:19.162
has to include methane,

46:19.167 --> 46:22.409
which is another damaging
greenhouse gas,

46:22.417 --> 46:25.614
quite rudely burped out
by the cows.

46:31.917 --> 46:35.284
While some livestock practices
offset that damage,

46:35.292 --> 46:38.124
the bad news for the hot dog kid

46:38.125 --> 46:41.162
is that we need to embrace
a more plant-rich diet.

46:42.625 --> 46:44.035
And the meat we do eat

46:44.042 --> 46:46.909
should ideally come from
regenerative practices

46:46.917 --> 46:48.407
like Fraser's.

46:49.792 --> 46:52.249
Plant-rich diet means that
we actually reduce

46:52.250 --> 46:56.744
the amount of protein that
we eat in wealthier nations,

46:56.750 --> 46:58.286
because it's too high.

46:58.292 --> 47:00.658
It's 100-110g per day.

47:00.667 --> 47:04.740
What we model is
decreasing that to 50-60 g.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.241
The fact is, some people
want to eat meat.

47:08.250 --> 47:11.037
What meat they eat
is critically important.

47:11.042 --> 47:13.749
How it's produced,
how it relates to the land

47:13.750 --> 47:15.911
are very, very important.

47:23.417 --> 47:27.160
But as our climate becomes
increasingly volatile,

47:27.167 --> 47:30.614
this type of farming has
one more crucial advantage.

47:32.375 --> 47:36.994
For every 1% increase in carbon
to 30cm,

47:37.000 --> 47:40.413
we increase the water holding
capacity of soil

47:40.417 --> 47:43.614
by 166,000 litres per hectare.

47:43.625 --> 47:45.035
On every rainfall event.

47:48.417 --> 47:50.908
When it rains,
the soil on the left,

47:50.917 --> 47:53.784
with more carbon
and organic matter,

47:53.792 --> 47:57.034
absorbs the water
and less runs off the top.

47:58.792 --> 48:01.283
Whereas the chemical-ridden
soil on the right

48:01.292 --> 48:06.286
absorbs almost no water,
and allows it to run off,

48:06.292 --> 48:08.283
taking the chemicals with it

48:08.292 --> 48:10.658
into nearby rivers
and waterways.

48:13.500 --> 48:15.286
Colin: That's the way we can
buffer against droughts

48:15.292 --> 48:16.782
and dry seasons.

48:16.792 --> 48:18.282
Grasslands,
all around the world,

48:18.292 --> 48:20.999
they virtually had a built-in
irrigation system.

48:22.417 --> 48:25.033
Fraser: Really can see
the aggregation that's going on

48:25.042 --> 48:26.532
from all these roots

48:26.542 --> 48:28.783
of all the different plants
we've been growing in here.

48:28.792 --> 48:30.874
So what we've got going here
with this clod

48:30.875 --> 48:33.036
is basically a dry paddock

48:33.042 --> 48:36.785
with, um, not much growing
in it, apart from a few weeds.

48:36.792 --> 48:38.498
And here, three months ago,

48:38.500 --> 48:43.244
we planted the multi-species
grazing crop, yeah.

48:44.417 --> 48:46.499
Damon: So that's in three
months that's happened?

48:46.500 --> 48:48.661
Fraser: That's in three-months.
It's incredible, isn't it?

48:48.667 --> 48:51.659
That kind of represents big ag,

48:51.667 --> 48:54.158
and this represents
mother nature.

48:54.167 --> 48:56.533
And it's pretty obvious
who I'd rather

48:56.542 --> 48:58.658
get my source of vegetables
from.

48:58.667 --> 49:01.909
Fraser: Well, when we talk
about trying to work out

49:01.917 --> 49:04.784
some of the global problems
and trying to do it quickly,

49:04.792 --> 49:07.499
well, you can really see the
speed that it can happen here.

49:07.500 --> 49:08.910
I mean, look at all these roots.

49:08.917 --> 49:11.374
Like, that's all carbon pumped,
isn't it?

49:11.375 --> 49:15.163
It is. It really shows that
plants, plants and more plants.

49:15.167 --> 49:18.034
In other words,
plant diversity, um,

49:18.042 --> 49:19.907
plus grazing animals

49:19.917 --> 49:22.408
will create that
and fix our problems.

49:24.292 --> 49:28.160
Eric: People ask me, "well,
what can we say to farmers?"

49:28.167 --> 49:30.783
And the answer is,
"we can't do without you."

49:30.792 --> 49:33.624
We can't mitigate climate
change without agriculture,

49:33.625 --> 49:35.536
so we have to find ways,

49:39.042 --> 49:40.998
instead of part of the problem.

49:44.042 --> 49:45.998
Damon: Fraser will now
let his multi-species crop

49:46.000 --> 49:47.661
break down.

49:49.667 --> 49:52.158
He can then plant
his commercial crops here

49:52.167 --> 49:55.159
without having to break
the soil and release carbon.

49:56.917 --> 49:59.158
But perhaps most importantly,

49:59.167 --> 50:01.533
he can now
take the kids fishing.

50:12.917 --> 50:15.784
So, I just bake it for
20 to 30 minutes?

50:15.792 --> 50:17.748
Yes, that's it. You've got it.

50:17.750 --> 50:19.240
And then, once it's done,

50:19.250 --> 50:21.366
you just sprinkle the Greens
on the top and that's it.

50:21.375 --> 50:22.615
Beautiful.

50:22.625 --> 50:24.911
- Thanks, nan. Love you.
- Ok. Bye, darl.

50:24.917 --> 50:26.282
Bye!

50:26.292 --> 50:29.124
Damon: By 2040, my hope, velvet,

50:29.125 --> 50:31.411
is that more people
will have an understanding

50:31.417 --> 50:34.784
of how the foods they eat
impact our environment.

50:37.125 --> 50:39.116
If this transpires,

50:39.125 --> 50:41.787
your generation are likely
to eat a lot less meat

50:41.792 --> 50:43.282
than mine did.

50:46.250 --> 50:48.036
There's no doubt
we'll continue our obsession

50:48.042 --> 50:49.407
with fad diets.

50:49.417 --> 50:52.159
We find it's the flavour-free
diet that's the way to go

50:52.167 --> 50:53.623
because let's face it -

50:53.625 --> 50:55.115
it's the flavour
that gets us into trouble.

50:55.125 --> 50:56.911
Isn't that right?

50:56.917 --> 50:58.908
Damon: I'll just love
tending our garden.

50:59.917 --> 51:01.407
From an app.

51:02.917 --> 51:05.499
And your mum and I will
completely understand

51:05.500 --> 51:07.786
when you start avoiding
dinner at our house.

51:13.042 --> 51:15.283
With less global
consumption of meat,

51:15.292 --> 51:18.284
aided by some pretty convincing
substitutes...

51:21.250 --> 51:23.992
We could see many feedlots
close down.

51:26.542 --> 51:29.158
And animals returned to the land

51:29.167 --> 51:31.158
for use in regenerative farming.

51:36.042 --> 51:38.283
But just imagine
what we could do

51:40.917 --> 51:44.159
that is currently being used
to grow food for animals.

51:48.500 --> 51:50.286
This land could transition

51:50.292 --> 51:53.249
to a range of
regenerative practices

51:53.250 --> 51:57.664
that drawdown vast amounts
of carbon into the soil,

51:57.667 --> 52:00.158
while retaining precious water

52:00.167 --> 52:02.658
and producing
nutrient-dense food.

52:08.125 --> 52:13.119
Instead of soy or grains, we
could feed the animals grass,

52:13.125 --> 52:16.913
crop residue, or food waste.

52:17.917 --> 52:20.408
This would improve
the health of the animals,

52:20.417 --> 52:23.784
the people who choose to
eat them

52:23.792 --> 52:25.657
and our environment.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.742
The steep croplands
around the world, darling,

52:34.750 --> 52:36.615
could be used to grow foods

52:36.625 --> 52:39.367
that also draw down huge
amounts of carbon.

52:41.500 --> 52:44.913
A practice called agroforestry
does this

52:44.917 --> 52:47.784
by simultaneously growing foods
like pawpaw,

52:47.792 --> 52:52.286
bananas, coffee, avocados
or vegetables,

52:52.292 --> 52:55.784
but crucially,
on small parcels of land.

52:58.417 --> 53:01.784
Woman: With highly diversified
local food systems,

53:01.792 --> 53:06.991
you have a way of really
dramatically decreasing

53:07.000 --> 53:11.790
the scale of land, water,
energy needed,

53:11.792 --> 53:13.748
and massively increasing

53:13.750 --> 53:15.661
how much you can get
from that land.

53:22.667 --> 53:25.158
Industrial ag says,
"without us, you're not...

53:25.167 --> 53:26.907
"You're going to starve.
You're not going to eat.â

53:26.917 --> 53:29.784
Well, actually between 70% and
80% of the food in the world

53:29.792 --> 53:31.657
is created by small holders.

53:35.792 --> 53:40.365
Industrial ag provides
20% of the food in the world.

53:40.375 --> 53:44.539
Most of that is corn
and soy fed to animals.

53:44.542 --> 53:47.409
A lot of that is sugar,
which we don't need.

53:48.667 --> 53:52.034
So the idea that big ag
is going to save us,

53:52.042 --> 53:54.784
or without which we cannot exist

53:54.792 --> 53:56.532
is absolutely upside down
and backwards,

53:56.542 --> 53:58.282
because they produce sickness,

53:58.292 --> 54:00.658
they produce obesity,
they produce diabetes.

54:00.667 --> 54:02.282
That's what big ag is producing.

54:05.417 --> 54:06.998
Damon: I hope one day, velvet,

54:07.000 --> 54:10.413
you get to read the story of
how we reached this future.

54:13.625 --> 54:15.616
It's about how those
who polluted our air

54:15.625 --> 54:17.490
with excess carbon

54:17.500 --> 54:19.161
had to pay a penalty.

54:20.750 --> 54:22.240
And the money raised

54:22.250 --> 54:25.037
paid farmers to clean our air

54:25.042 --> 54:26.657
by putting it back
into the soil.

54:30.375 --> 54:32.161
This helped restore
the climate...

54:33.917 --> 54:35.623
Biodiversity loss...

54:36.917 --> 54:38.407
And land conversion...

54:39.417 --> 54:41.874
While pulling more people
into the doughnut

54:41.875 --> 54:44.787
by saving precious water,

54:44.792 --> 54:47.909
improving the quality
of our food,

54:47.917 --> 54:51.114
and in turn
improving our health.

55:04.417 --> 55:05.998
It's interesting,
making this film,

55:06.000 --> 55:07.911
the more that
I'm learning about...

55:09.417 --> 55:12.659
You realise how hard it is
to actually do the right thing.

55:12.667 --> 55:16.615
And in a sense, it's tempting
to kind of just shut down

55:16.625 --> 55:18.115
and switch off

55:18.125 --> 55:20.411
because, I mean, here I am
sitting on an aeroplane

55:20.417 --> 55:23.659
that is spewing out
half a tonne of carbon,

55:23.667 --> 55:25.282
making this film,

55:25.292 --> 55:27.157
or getting water in this cup

55:27.167 --> 55:28.907
that's probably going to go
straight into the ocean

55:28.917 --> 55:30.623
and hurt a baby turtle,

55:30.625 --> 55:32.616
and I don't want to know that.

55:32.625 --> 55:34.115
And most people don't want to
know about that,

55:34.125 --> 55:35.615
so they switch off.

55:35.625 --> 55:39.288
And you can't help but be
a hypocrite at the moment

55:39.292 --> 55:43.285
because our entire system is
built on and by fossil fuels.

55:44.375 --> 55:45.865
Fossil fuels have done us
really well

55:45.875 --> 55:47.240
to get to this point.

55:47.250 --> 55:48.740
There's some great
things in the world.

55:48.750 --> 55:50.240
But we can't keep doing
what we're doing.

55:50.250 --> 55:51.615
It's actually impossible

55:51.625 --> 55:53.741
to maintain the resources
we're using.

55:53.750 --> 55:55.741
So we're going to
have to transition,

55:55.750 --> 55:57.240
and it's going to be
a little bit awkward,

55:57.250 --> 55:59.241
if we're going to give
our kids a better future.

56:11.875 --> 56:14.287
J we are setting sail

56:15.417 --> 56:17.282
j to the place on the map

56:17.292 --> 56:20.659
j from which no-one
has ever returned... j

56:21.917 --> 56:24.249
Damon: While storing carbon
in our soil

56:24.250 --> 56:27.663
will go a long way
to solving our problem,

56:27.667 --> 56:31.239
there is a limit to how much
carbon soil can hold.

56:32.375 --> 56:35.242
So we're going to need another
leg-up from mother nature.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.912
Make sure coral looks ok

56:39.917 --> 56:42.909
'cause it normally looks like
a rainbow in the sea

56:42.917 --> 56:45.374
with all the fishes,

56:45.375 --> 56:47.616
but sometimes if you litter,

56:47.625 --> 56:50.367
it looks a bit not good.

56:50.375 --> 56:55.415
It looks like... a big, big
mess.

56:56.625 --> 56:58.911
At the beach,
it would just not be the same

56:58.917 --> 57:00.908
if you can't swim in the water.

57:00.917 --> 57:03.909
And also all the really amazing
marine animals

57:03.917 --> 57:06.784
like vaquita, whales, sea fish -

57:06.792 --> 57:09.909
if they were all gone, then
it just wouldn't be the same,

57:09.917 --> 57:11.157
the world.

57:11.167 --> 57:14.739
I want the oceans to be cleaner.

57:18.167 --> 57:19.657
Paul: One of the coming
attractions

57:19.667 --> 57:21.908
that I think is gonna to have
the biggest impact

57:21.917 --> 57:25.660
is what is called
marine permaculture.

57:25.667 --> 57:28.124
It's just another way of
farming in the ocean,

57:28.125 --> 57:30.616
but this is a more wild farming

57:30.625 --> 57:32.786
because it actually
sets up the context

57:32.792 --> 57:35.750
for the oceans to
regenerate themselves.

57:45.292 --> 57:47.999
Paul: Dr Brian Von herzen,
a physicist,

57:48.000 --> 57:49.490
used to fly to Europe every year

57:49.500 --> 57:53.243
and he saw how quickly the
Greenland ice sheet was melting

57:53.250 --> 57:55.912
and decided to change
his whole life in 2006

57:55.917 --> 57:57.407
to restoring living systems,

57:57.417 --> 57:58.907
and focused on the ocean.

58:03.167 --> 58:05.533
Damon: Brian told me
to pack a lunch...

58:05.542 --> 58:07.498
And a sick bag,

58:07.500 --> 58:10.037
as we were spending the day
out at sea.

58:16.625 --> 58:18.536
Man: With 93% of global warming

58:18.542 --> 58:20.533
going into the ocean today
each year,

58:20.542 --> 58:23.499
the problem is that
the waters are getting too warm

58:23.500 --> 58:25.912
and without enough
overturning circulation,

58:25.917 --> 58:27.498
and there aren't enough
nutrients,

58:27.500 --> 58:30.412
and the result is
we lose the life in the ocean.

58:32.125 --> 58:34.912
Damon: Understandably,
there has been reluctance

58:34.917 --> 58:36.657
to meddle with our oceans.

58:37.917 --> 58:39.657
But the fact that they
are getting warmer,

58:39.667 --> 58:41.749
becoming acidic,

58:41.750 --> 58:45.288
and many fish species are now
in danger of collapse...

58:47.125 --> 58:49.286
Means that they
actually need our help.

58:52.417 --> 58:55.033
Brian's solution is seaweed.

58:56.917 --> 58:59.408
So what we do
with marine permaculture

58:59.417 --> 59:02.614
is we restore
overturning circulation.

59:02.625 --> 59:05.742
It's as if your leg was asleep
and you lost circulation.

59:05.750 --> 59:07.411
We have to do that
with the ocean.

59:07.417 --> 59:09.908
We've gotta get that
overturning circulation

59:09.917 --> 59:10.906
going again

59:10.917 --> 59:13.874
to bring the cool waters up
with the higher nutrient levels

59:13.875 --> 59:17.163
that can actually restore
conditions for the seaweeds.

59:18.917 --> 59:20.908
Between Australia
and the United States,

59:20.917 --> 59:24.535
there's 100,000,000 km?
Of ocean desert

59:24.542 --> 59:27.409
that is amenable to
marine permaculture.

59:28.500 --> 59:31.788
We can actually restore life
in subtropical oceans,

59:31.792 --> 59:35.785
restore the fish habitat that's
needed to restore fisheries.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.618
Damon: Marine permaculture
is a regenerative technology

59:41.625 --> 59:43.115
that works like this.

59:44.375 --> 59:46.991
A frame made of
recycled material

59:47.000 --> 59:49.992
becomes a platform for
the seaweed to grow on.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.241
It sits just below the surface

59:52.250 --> 59:55.742
and sinks lower as the
seaweed grows and gets heavier.

59:58.125 --> 01:00:01.663
A pump powered simply by
the rise and fall of the ocean,

01:00:01.667 --> 01:00:04.784
brings the cold, nutrient-laden
waters from below

01:00:04.792 --> 01:00:07.374
and disperses them
over the seaweed

01:00:07.375 --> 01:00:09.536
in the upper warmer layer.

01:00:09.542 --> 01:00:11.908
The seaweed can be
regularly harvested

01:00:11.917 --> 01:00:13.999
and used for a range
of purposes.

01:00:15.375 --> 01:00:19.288
Seaweed is good for food,
animal feed, fertiliser,

01:00:19.292 --> 01:00:20.873
fibre and biofuel.

01:00:20.875 --> 01:00:22.911
There's so much we can do
with seaweeds.

01:00:30.542 --> 01:00:36.162
So, we're cruising along in
this very low-carbon vessel,

01:00:36.167 --> 01:00:37.907
following Brian,

01:00:37.917 --> 01:00:40.408
who's swum down
to get the seaweed

01:00:40.417 --> 01:00:42.783
in one of his testing sites
here.

01:00:47.667 --> 01:00:49.248
Except he's gone,

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:52.492
and he's been underwater for
about two minutes and, um...

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:53.785
Brian!

01:00:55.792 --> 01:00:57.657
Brian?!

01:00:57.667 --> 01:00:59.498
- Brian: I found it.
- You found it.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.365
- Yeah.
- Alright, we'll come to you.

01:01:03.042 --> 01:01:04.532
The permaculture tests

01:01:04.542 --> 01:01:08.034
that Brian and his team have
conducted in the south pacific

01:01:08.042 --> 01:01:10.624
have seen marine life return,

01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:14.368
and the seaweed transform the
quality of the water itself.

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.786
Brian: Seaweeds actually
draw down

01:01:19.792 --> 01:01:22.499
carbon dioxide
from the ocean waters.

01:01:23.875 --> 01:01:26.491
And they restore the alkalinity
of the ocean.

01:01:27.792 --> 01:01:31.535
That enables shellfish
and other creatures to thrive.

01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:38.284
Damon, I thought we'd try
some seaweed salad today.

01:01:38.292 --> 01:01:39.782
Oh.

01:01:42.792 --> 01:01:44.623
Well, the little bursts of gas
are good.

01:01:44.625 --> 01:01:46.115
Yeah. Like little poppers.

01:01:49.167 --> 01:01:51.158
Ok. That's actually pretty good.

01:01:51.167 --> 01:01:52.748
Seaweed salad.

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.287
So, what kind of... we're
getting omega 3s in here.

01:01:55.292 --> 01:01:56.532
- What kind of...
- Oh, yeah.

01:01:56.542 --> 01:01:57.873
What's our source?

01:01:57.875 --> 01:02:00.662
Epa, dha, antioxidants,
phytonutrients,

01:02:00.667 --> 01:02:02.282
omega nutrients.

01:02:03.625 --> 01:02:08.369
Damon: But this humble weed has
one more heroic trait to offer.

01:02:09.542 --> 01:02:13.034
It could play a profound role
in drawing down carbon.

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:16.161
Well, this is an example
of brown seaweed.

01:02:16.167 --> 01:02:20.285
The fastest brown seaweeds
will grow half a metre per day.

01:02:20.292 --> 01:02:22.533
Hang on. Half a metre a day?

01:02:22.542 --> 01:02:24.032
Half a metre a day.

01:02:24.042 --> 01:02:25.907
And they'll grow over 50m long.

01:02:25.917 --> 01:02:28.408
Is that one of the fastest
growing plants in the world?

01:02:28.417 --> 01:02:31.284
It is the fastest-growing
tree on the planet.

01:02:31.292 --> 01:02:33.533
Wow. Ok. So that's why
the understanding of...

01:02:33.542 --> 01:02:35.624
That it's going to be pulling
carbon out of the atmosphere

01:02:35.625 --> 01:02:37.616
very quickly,
because it grows so fast.

01:02:37.625 --> 01:02:41.994
Thousands of tonnes of carbon
per square kilometre per year.

01:02:43.417 --> 01:02:44.782
Wow. Ok.

01:02:46.042 --> 01:02:47.873
Win! It's not a weed at all.

01:02:47.875 --> 01:02:50.912
It's food,
it's habitat for fish,

01:02:50.917 --> 01:02:52.999
it gives back to
the fish ecosystems,

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.490
and we balance carbon.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.036
We measure the carbon export.

01:02:58.792 --> 01:03:01.624
The testing of large-scale
marine permaculture

01:03:01.625 --> 01:03:03.035
is yet to be done.

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.491
But the stakes
couldn't be any higher

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.990
for getting them underway.

01:03:09.792 --> 01:03:15.287
This is all about restoring the
foundation of our civilisation,

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.624
because with climate disruption,

01:03:17.625 --> 01:03:20.287
we'll deplete the soils,
we'll deplete the oceans.

01:03:20.292 --> 01:03:22.408
There will be
no civilisation left

01:03:22.417 --> 01:03:26.035
because any time
you lose that foundation

01:03:26.042 --> 01:03:28.249
of food and the soils
and the seas,

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:29.990
you lose civilisation as well.

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:59.789
Damon: So, velvet, because
the warming will increase

01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:02.408
over the next two decades,

01:04:02.417 --> 01:04:05.159
and sea levels
will continue to rise...

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:12.621
Some countries will need to
adapt in new and creative ways.

01:04:19.917 --> 01:04:22.659
But if predictions of severe
droughts are realised

01:04:22.667 --> 01:04:25.784
that see shortages of food,

01:04:25.792 --> 01:04:29.410
the potential for unprecedented
numbers of refugees

01:04:29.417 --> 01:04:31.783
and civil unrest
around the world...

01:04:33.375 --> 01:04:34.865
Is enormous.

01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:46.288
Just imagine large-scale
marine permaculture,

01:04:46.292 --> 01:04:48.908
helping to mitigate
the severity of such a crisis.

01:04:52.042 --> 01:04:53.907
It could provide
an alternative food source

01:04:53.917 --> 01:04:55.407
to the damaged land crops...

01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:59.787
That is rich in protein
and other nutrients.

01:05:03.042 --> 01:05:04.532
Kate: Instead of having
governments

01:05:04.542 --> 01:05:06.407
that are reacting to disaster,

01:05:06.417 --> 01:05:08.282
we need governments
and communities

01:05:08.292 --> 01:05:11.489
and businesses that proactively
set a new vision

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.365
that prevents these disasters,

01:05:13.375 --> 01:05:15.415
that actually takes us
off in a different direction.

01:05:18.167 --> 01:05:21.534
Investment in marine
permaculture around the world

01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:24.284
could generate countless jobs

01:05:24.292 --> 01:05:26.908
and help us reduce
our meat consumption,

01:05:26.917 --> 01:05:29.624
while sequestering staggering
amounts of carbon.

01:05:33.542 --> 01:05:38.411
Imagine decommissioned oil rigs
converted to house the workers

01:05:38.417 --> 01:05:41.409
and becoming exciting
tourist destinations

01:05:41.417 --> 01:05:44.250
for those keen
to explore marine life.

01:05:52.792 --> 01:05:55.158
The seaweed could be
particularly valuable

01:05:55.167 --> 01:05:59.911
in climate vulnerable areas
like the bay of bengal,

01:05:59.917 --> 01:06:03.614
where it could provide food,
fertiliser and biofuel.

01:06:05.042 --> 01:06:08.660
Along the coast of Africa, it
could provide similar benefits,

01:06:08.667 --> 01:06:11.374
contributing to a thriving
local economy.

01:06:17.167 --> 01:06:19.909
Paul: With mechanisms,
simple ones,

01:06:19.917 --> 01:06:23.284
you are in fact
regenerating the oceans.

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:27.911
You could feed 10 billion people

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:30.659
with the protein from
marine permaculture alone.

01:06:50.917 --> 01:06:52.623
At this point of the trip,

01:06:52.625 --> 01:06:56.538
I felt for the first time
like we genuinely have a chance

01:06:56.542 --> 01:06:58.032
at a better future...

01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:00.786
If we choose to take it.

01:07:06.292 --> 01:07:10.410
But before heading home, there
was another subject to address.

01:07:14.542 --> 01:07:17.158
Well, I wish they'd stop
killing off animals

01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:19.658
and, well, forests and whatnot.

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:22.740
That'd be cool.

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:27.789
Probably for people to
acknowledge that, like,

01:07:27.792 --> 01:07:29.498
the factories we build

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.913
and, like, they hurt nature
sometimes.

01:07:32.917 --> 01:07:35.033
Like, the things
that we produce,

01:07:35.042 --> 01:07:39.661
it can, like, hurt the wildlife
and it's not good.

01:07:39.667 --> 01:07:41.783
But people just ignore it
right now.

01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:45.660
I would like to see everyone
using the three rs -

01:07:45.667 --> 01:07:48.158
reduce, reuse and recycle.

01:07:48.167 --> 01:07:51.534
Many people know about it,
but don't practice it today.

01:08:03.542 --> 01:08:05.999
Kate: Today's economy, right?

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.786
It gets bigger
faster and faster.

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:11.410
So the economy is doubling
in size nearly every 20 years.

01:08:13.292 --> 01:08:16.613
We take earth's materials,
turn them into stuff we want,

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:18.832
we use it for a while
and then throw it away.

01:08:18.832 --> 01:08:19.822
Yep.

01:08:19.832 --> 01:08:21.368
And that take, make, use, lose -

01:08:21.375 --> 01:08:23.741
it cuts against the
living cycles of the planet,

01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:26.822
causing climate change,
causing pollution.

01:08:29.875 --> 01:08:32.366
So we're kicking ourselves
out of planetary balance.

01:08:36.207 --> 01:08:38.493
It is difficult to see
the impacts

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:41.617
of our individual resource use
on the broader environment.

01:08:44.375 --> 01:08:48.072
But our survival could depend
on us making that connection.

01:08:50.625 --> 01:08:54.493
For greater than
99.9% of our evolution,

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:57.492
human beings lived in this
very intimate association

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.331
with the natural world.

01:08:59.332 --> 01:09:03.076
The decisions we made
on a daily basis as individuals

01:09:03.082 --> 01:09:05.243
within the context of
communities,

01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:07.582
they were informed by
this immediate feedback

01:09:07.582 --> 01:09:09.868
we got from the world around us.

01:09:09.875 --> 01:09:13.367
From the sun, from the water
that was falling on us.

01:09:13.375 --> 01:09:15.741
And you fast forward
to this little blip of time

01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:18.366
that we're in right now,
and, you know,

01:09:18.375 --> 01:09:20.616
we're completely and totally
alienated from nature.

01:09:20.625 --> 01:09:22.115
We've lost that connection.

01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:28.617
I've come to the town of
oberlin in Ohio,

01:09:28.625 --> 01:09:30.240
where John and his team

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:32.616
have come up with
a quite brilliant way

01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:36.072
to raise awareness of
their community's resource use.

01:09:39.082 --> 01:09:40.823
The environmental dashboard

01:09:40.832 --> 01:09:42.743
was really kind of built around
the science

01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:44.866
and putting people and humans
in connection with

01:09:44.875 --> 01:09:46.991
how they're using
their natural resources.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.740
And so what this does

01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:52.993
is it gives a visual
representation of the usage.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.491
And they put it into the schools

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.367
and so it's really gotten
a lot more into the community.

01:09:58.375 --> 01:10:02.368
And the teachers are
utilising it in their lessons.

01:10:02.375 --> 01:10:04.081
I want you to pay
close attention

01:10:04.083 --> 01:10:06.495
to the squirrel on
the right side.

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.240
And watch what happens.

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:13.825
As it goes down, he gets sadder
and sadder and starts to cry.

01:10:13.833 --> 01:10:16.245
Teacher: Why do you think the
squirrel got happier or sadder?

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:17.740
I noticed that too.

01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:19.240
Well, probably
because we're using

01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:21.115
a lot of electricity
at that point.

01:10:21.125 --> 01:10:23.081
More than we regularly used.

01:10:23.083 --> 01:10:24.573
John: We did a controlled study

01:10:24.583 --> 01:10:26.574
where we have
another school system

01:10:26.583 --> 01:10:28.699
very similar to oberlin's
school systems

01:10:28.708 --> 01:10:30.244
in a different area of Ohio.

01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:32.366
They've got
the same curriculum as we do,

01:10:32.375 --> 01:10:33.865
but they don't have dashboard.

01:10:33.875 --> 01:10:36.742
We found as a result of
exposure,

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:39.617
if you ask them about
electricity use,

01:10:39.625 --> 01:10:42.367
they start talking about
emotions.

01:10:42.375 --> 01:10:44.991
And when you compare
students in our school

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.581
with this other school,

01:10:46.583 --> 01:10:48.824
they also have more of
a community response

01:10:48.833 --> 01:10:52.121
when they talk about what needs
to be done about energy use.

01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:53.990
They use the word 'we'.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.242
And in the other school system,
they use the word 't'.

01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:59.366
So we've seen real change

01:10:59.375 --> 01:11:03.323
as a result of this technology
in the school.

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:09.822
Damon: What is most exciting
about this idea

01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:11.869
is that the dashboards
could reconnect us

01:11:11.875 --> 01:11:13.456
to a range of resources...

01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:17.115
And influence our behaviour.

01:11:20.625 --> 01:11:22.581
Sharon: It's a way to really
engage the community

01:11:22.583 --> 01:11:24.119
in this discussion,

01:11:24.125 --> 01:11:27.868
regardless of what race,
what education, economic level,

01:11:27.875 --> 01:11:29.740
in this discussion
on sustainability

01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:31.240
and the environment.

01:11:36.958 --> 01:11:39.370
But awareness of
our resource use

01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:41.741
is just one piece of
a complicated puzzle.

01:11:43.333 --> 01:11:44.823
Another solution

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:47.370
that could have a huge impact
on our dilemma

01:11:47.375 --> 01:11:49.991
caught me completely off-guard.

01:11:53.333 --> 01:11:57.622
Paul: Probably our biggest
surprise was educating girls

01:11:57.625 --> 01:12:00.241
and family planning.

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:01.865
You combine these two together,

01:12:01.875 --> 01:12:04.366
the number one solution
to reversing global warming

01:12:04.375 --> 01:12:06.206
is the empowerment
of girls and women.

01:12:06.208 --> 01:12:07.698
Damon: Wow.

01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:18.947
Damon: So, our daughter
starts school next year

01:12:18.958 --> 01:12:21.370
and as an Australian,

01:12:21.375 --> 01:12:24.117
I completely take for granted

01:12:24.125 --> 01:12:27.572
that she will get to complete
her education.

01:12:27.583 --> 01:12:29.574
And what I'm just learning here

01:12:29.583 --> 01:12:33.075
is that there are 65 million
girls around the world

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:34.619
that don't get that opportunity.

01:12:35.833 --> 01:12:37.323
And there's a host of reasons
for that.

01:12:37.333 --> 01:12:39.870
Some are put to work to
support families

01:12:39.875 --> 01:12:41.365
or they're married off.

01:12:41.375 --> 01:12:42.865
But on average,

01:12:42.875 --> 01:12:45.833
those girls will have
five or more children.

01:12:48.583 --> 01:12:50.244
Woman: So we found
that across the board,

01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:51.740
and this isn't just countries

01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:53.240
where there might be
high rates of poverty.

01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:54.615
Even wealthier countries,

01:12:54.625 --> 01:12:57.617
we know that when girls
stay in school for longer

01:12:57.625 --> 01:13:00.742
and they have access to good
reproductive health services,

01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:03.332
as well as decent
work opportunities,

01:13:03.333 --> 01:13:05.995
that women will tend to delay
having children

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.490
until they're ready,

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.957
and then they choose to have
fewer children from then on.

01:13:09.958 --> 01:13:11.619
So, what this does
as a collective,

01:13:11.625 --> 01:13:14.332
is it slows down
the population growth rate,

01:13:14.333 --> 01:13:15.869
which means that
there's less pressure

01:13:15.875 --> 01:13:19.072
and competition for access to
a whole range of resources,

01:13:19.083 --> 01:13:21.244
whether it's food or water
or land.

01:13:22.875 --> 01:13:24.957
Their children tend to
stay in school longer as well

01:13:24.958 --> 01:13:28.746
and, over time, they break
that cycle of poverty.

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:34.957
So it's a form of
family planning,

01:13:34.958 --> 01:13:36.494
but it's not coercive.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:37.956
It's not control.

01:13:37.958 --> 01:13:41.871
It's just empowering girls
to be who they want to be

01:13:41.875 --> 01:13:44.947
and you have
these incredible benefits.

01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:55.448
One child, one teacher,

01:13:55.458 --> 01:13:59.121
one book and one pen

01:13:59.125 --> 01:14:00.865
can change the world.

01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:24.994
Damon: So this could be
a pleasant afternoon

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.616
in a standard city of 2040.

01:14:34.583 --> 01:14:36.448
Freed-up space has encouraged

01:14:36.458 --> 01:14:39.245
a range of new
outdoor activities.

01:14:43.375 --> 01:14:47.323
Imagine, velvet, you and
your cool group of friends

01:14:47.333 --> 01:14:48.948
have met for a picnic.

01:14:50.625 --> 01:14:52.115
Although it is unlikely

01:14:52.125 --> 01:14:54.366
that Princess Elsa will still
be part of your crew.

01:14:58.750 --> 01:15:03.323
My hope is that we are all
using resources more wisely

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:06.120
and some of the clever
innovations that exist today...

01:15:06.125 --> 01:15:07.615
Man: Selfiel

01:15:07.625 --> 01:15:09.490
except for this drone phone
that I did make up

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:10.990
to obliterate selfie sticks...

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.615
Man: Home!

01:15:12.625 --> 01:15:14.616
Have been widely adopted.

01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:22.324
Some materials are grown
or made from organic matter.

01:15:27.875 --> 01:15:32.244
While other materials have been
recycled or break down rapidly.

01:15:35.333 --> 01:15:36.869
And wouldn't it be terrific

01:15:36.875 --> 01:15:38.831
if we have not only implemented
the smart ways

01:15:38.833 --> 01:15:41.370
to deal with the billions of
coffee cups

01:15:41.375 --> 01:15:43.081
we send to landfill each year...

01:15:45.125 --> 01:15:46.740
But each city of the world

01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:48.991
has followed the lead of
Stockholm,

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.366
who collect their residents'
food waste...

01:15:53.625 --> 01:15:56.617
Extract the methane to
power their local vehicles...

01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:00.582
And give the leftovers
to farmers

01:16:00.583 --> 01:16:03.370
to use as a natural
fertiliser for their soils.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:08.492
Well played, Sweden.
Well played.

01:16:12.125 --> 01:16:14.741
These behaviour changes
in our resource use

01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:16.706
could be reflected on dashboards

01:16:16.708 --> 01:16:18.869
throughout our cities,

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:20.615
where there used to be ads.

01:16:22.833 --> 01:16:25.370
Even encouraging some
healthy competition.

01:16:32.375 --> 01:16:34.331
But in this 2040,

01:16:34.333 --> 01:16:36.995
my greatest hope

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.366
is that girls across the globe

01:16:39.375 --> 01:16:42.742
now have access to the same
educational opportunities

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:44.866
as you and your friends.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.366
The cascading benefits of this

01:17:02.375 --> 01:17:06.618
could be greater than anything
else I have discovered.

01:18:04.958 --> 01:18:08.997
So, velvet, this was my story

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.072
of a future I hope
you get to experience.

01:18:13.333 --> 01:18:17.246
Your story and
the one that transpires

01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:18.865
may be completely different.

01:18:20.125 --> 01:18:22.081
But what I now understand

01:18:22.083 --> 01:18:24.495
is that not only are there
so many people

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.367
who want to take part
in telling a new story...

01:18:29.083 --> 01:18:32.826
But we have everything
we need right now

01:18:32.833 --> 01:18:34.619
to make it happen.

01:18:37.875 --> 01:18:41.743
Helena: When you go beyond
the dominant media discourse

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:43.991
and get closer to the ground,

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.743
you will see,
everywhere you look,

01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:50.116
incredible reasons for hope.

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:02.115
Over the next few years,

01:19:02.125 --> 01:19:04.616
you may notice less
red meat for dinner...

01:19:06.833 --> 01:19:08.619
More trips to the compost bin...

01:19:11.458 --> 01:19:13.119
Better search engines...

01:19:16.333 --> 01:19:19.496
And potentially a new
dashboard in your classroom.

01:19:22.375 --> 01:19:27.324
If enough of us make
these sorts of small changes,

01:19:27.333 --> 01:19:30.120
when combined,
they will make a difference.

01:19:31.875 --> 01:19:33.991
Big banks continue to take a hit

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.197
as the public shifts its money
away from organisations

01:19:37.208 --> 01:19:39.119
that support fossil fuels.

01:19:41.083 --> 01:19:44.120
But of equal importance
is strong leadership.

01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:49.867
Wouldn't it be terrific
if new leaders emerge

01:19:49.875 --> 01:19:52.082
who can navigate us
to a better 20407?

01:19:55.875 --> 01:19:58.867
And just imagine if they used
the doughnut framework

01:19:58.875 --> 01:20:00.581
to create the new story...

01:20:01.875 --> 01:20:03.991
Coupled with more
and more people

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.241
finding a defining role
within it.

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:11.742
What we can do
is see where you get lit up

01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:13.456
and maybe it's
girls' education -

01:20:13.458 --> 01:20:14.994
"wow. I had no idea!"

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.332
Or it can be food or it can be
farming or it could be energy,

01:20:18.333 --> 01:20:20.449
it could be housing, transport.

01:20:20.458 --> 01:20:22.369
I mean, there's so many areas

01:20:22.375 --> 01:20:25.993
where you actually probably
do have influence

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.991
where you are working,

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.241
where you can affect change

01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:32.741
in a way that actually
is demonstrable

01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:34.991
and meaningful
to you and others.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.322
And it just unleashes
the power of innovation

01:20:43.333 --> 01:20:47.372
and imagination and creativity
that's within all people.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.116
Damon: My hope for you, darling,

01:20:57.125 --> 01:20:59.616
is that sometime in 2040

01:20:59.625 --> 01:21:01.240
there's a day

01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:03.992
when the greenhouse gases
in our atmosphere

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.743
stop increasing and
begin to come down.

01:21:09.458 --> 01:21:11.949
And the solutions
that achieve this

01:21:11.958 --> 01:21:14.370
benefit a wide range of people.

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:23.322

across the globe

01:21:23.333 --> 01:21:25.494
for you and your generation.

01:21:26.875 --> 01:21:28.456
The regeneration.

01:22:10.083 --> 01:22:13.996
When I grow up, I want homeless
people to have their own homes

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.366
with their own money
to buy their own food

01:22:16.375 --> 01:22:17.865
and have their own jobs.

and to care for the world.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.332
I would like to see everybody
have equal rights

01:22:28.333 --> 01:22:30.244
and the same living
opportunities.

01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:33.741
I just want the future
to be good.

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:44.956
Dadda!

01:22:55.625 --> 01:22:57.115
Damon: So...

01:22:58.875 --> 01:23:00.615

Child: I want to see clean
air for more people to breathe

01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:17.619

01:25:17.625 --> 01:25:21.823
don't have to take the smoke
into their leaves and die.

01:25:24.375 --> 01:25:28.243
Child: I also hope that we'll
be able to solve world hunger,

01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:30.366
'cause a lot of people
are going hungry.

01:25:31.375 --> 01:25:33.366
Child: At the moment,
the ice caps are melting

01:25:33.375 --> 01:25:35.491
because of all
the greenhouse gases.

01:25:37.125 --> 01:25:39.867

Harmony and happiness

and not a world
where people live in fear.

01:26:20.375 --> 01:26:21.990
Child: I don't think
we should use guns

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.615

and make sure coral looks ok

01:26:57.958 --> 01:27:00.950

like a rainbow in the sea.

01:27:00.958 --> 01:27:03.745
