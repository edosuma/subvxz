WEBVTT

00:41.208 --> 00:43.511
Shit.
Give me a cigarette.

00:43.545 --> 00:46.380
-Give me a cigarette, all right?
-Here you go.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.318
Where's the fucking lighter?

00:51.351 --> 00:52.486
Hi.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.622
Hey, Bee.

00:54.656 --> 00:56.189
Hey, Stan.

00:56.758 --> 00:57.959
How's work?

00:57.992 --> 00:59.694
-The same shit.
-Hmm.

01:00.762 --> 01:01.829
Can we talk?

01:01.863 --> 01:03.196
Sure.

01:03.731 --> 01:04.766
Alone?

01:05.600 --> 01:07.167
Y'all go on inside.

01:21.816 --> 01:22.850
So what's up?

01:24.819 --> 01:26.386
Just give me a second.

01:31.693 --> 01:32.727
Bee?

01:36.096 --> 01:37.799
I went to the doctor.

01:37.832 --> 01:39.099
Yeah?

01:39.767 --> 01:41.168
What?

01:41.201 --> 01:43.504
I don't know.
I just...

01:43.538 --> 01:46.373
-You just what?
-Oh, God, I can't do this.

01:51.613 --> 01:53.848
Can I just get
a glass of water first?

01:55.115 --> 01:56.751
You just tell me now.

01:59.787 --> 02:00.888
I'm pregnant.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.628
Well, shit...

02:10.497 --> 02:11.833
Did you just hear
what I said?

02:11.866 --> 02:14.802
Yeah, I heard you.
But I thought
it was impossible.

02:15.603 --> 02:16.904
Yeah, me, too.

02:18.773 --> 02:20.307
What happened
to your lip?

02:20.708 --> 02:21.743
Nothing.

02:23.511 --> 02:26.413
Well, you thought you could
just sneak in here
and cover it up

02:26.446 --> 02:28.415
before I got back home
from work?

02:28.448 --> 02:30.283
Look, I'm having
this baby, okay?

02:30.317 --> 02:32.086
And it might be
the only chance I get.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.789
-All right. Well...
-No, just hear me out.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.356
We can leave it at this.

02:36.390 --> 02:40.494
You know, you can...
I don't know,
go on with your life

02:40.528 --> 02:43.798
and just go our separate ways,
and I'll just...
I'll raise him myself.

02:44.098 --> 02:45.265
Him?

02:45.667 --> 02:46.768
It's a boy?

02:46.801 --> 02:49.469
Well, it better be.
I don't want the competition.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.739
Y'all having son?

02:51.773 --> 02:52.674
Dude!

02:52.707 --> 02:55.475
Oh, shit! Sorry, man.
The doors is open.

02:55.510 --> 02:58.880
-Shut it.
-Shut the fucking door,
Stan, please?

02:58.913 --> 03:00.280
Whoo!
I'm gonna be an uncle.

03:00.313 --> 03:03.183
Wipe that smile off your face,
Jimmy V, I'm not done yet.

03:06.821 --> 03:10.625
I don't want our boys
seeing you with
a lip like that, ever.

03:11.759 --> 03:12.694
Yeah.

03:13.728 --> 03:16.531
We've gotta change.
Okay? And I want a house.

03:16.564 --> 03:19.499
Doesn't have to be
anything fancy.
Just somewhere safe.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.270
Okay.

03:23.303 --> 03:26.206
I'm going to take care
of you and the boy,

03:26.874 --> 03:28.442
even if he's a girl.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.344
Yeah? How are you
going to do that?

03:31.378 --> 03:33.948
I don't know.
Talk to Uncle Ray.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.216
Maybe he can put in
a good word
for me or something.

03:36.249 --> 03:38.285
What?
Driving trucks?

03:41.122 --> 03:42.924
What about getting
into selling cars?

03:44.458 --> 03:46.594
Can you really
see me in a tie?

I got it.
How about the frame?

06:16.177 --> 06:17.211
Yeah, I just got it.

06:17.245 --> 06:18.846
Good. Take a look at this.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.348
Okay.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.917
One of the
best systems available.

06:22.950 --> 06:26.354
Can last for a long time.
Got the gear system
and the brakes.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.788
Unbelievable.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.824
Oh, ready to go.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.193
I'm gonna get you back.

06:32.226 --> 06:35.196
-I'm gonna get you back.
-Hey, I'm just glad
I could help.

06:35.229 --> 06:36.496
-By the way...
-Yeah.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.600
Could you handle
a long haul shift for me
next week?

06:39.634 --> 06:41.602
-Be the last one.
-I got you.

06:43.037 --> 06:44.906
Have a good day, James.

06:44.939 --> 06:45.973

07:58.579 --> 08:00.881
Jack. Jack.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.485
- Come on, bud.
- Jack?

08:08.122 --> 08:11.392
Time to wake up, buddy.
Come on. Let's go.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.066
-Mom.
-Hmm?

08:19.100 --> 08:20.534
My head hurts.

08:22.236 --> 08:24.772
-Yeah? Okay, come here.
Let me see.
-A lot.

08:26.674 --> 08:30.745
Well, you feel okay to me.
I don't think so, hon, okay?
Got to go to school.

08:33.147 --> 08:35.249
- Thank you.
- Yep.

08:43.224 --> 08:45.860
Jack, take a couple
more bites,
we're gonna be late.

08:48.496 --> 08:50.231
All right.
We'll see you later.

08:50.264 --> 08:51.966
- Forget something?
- Hmm.

08:53.401 --> 08:55.403
-Thank you.
-Nice catch.

08:55.436 --> 08:57.638
Have a good day.

08:57.671 --> 08:58.906
You, too.

09:21.062 --> 09:23.631
All right. One more game.
One more game.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.666
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

09:26.434 --> 09:28.769
Here we go.

09:29.470 --> 09:31.540
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:31.572 --> 09:32.640
Who is that?

09:32.673 --> 09:33.908
Swamp Lion.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.444
That's right.
You want to go for a ride?

09:36.477 --> 09:38.379
-Yes.
-You do?

09:38.412 --> 09:39.447
Yes.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.282
Well, look out the window.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.350
What do you see?

09:43.384 --> 09:44.485
A hot air balloon.

09:44.519 --> 09:46.854
That's right.
My hot air balloon.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.723
The one that I stole
from the amusement park.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.560
-You want to get in?
-Yeah.

09:51.592 --> 09:52.927
Then let's get in.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.995
You know what he wanted
to hear tonight?

09:55.029 --> 09:56.163
What's that?

09:56.197 --> 09:58.666
-Swamp Lion.
-Really?

09:58.699 --> 10:00.367
How long has
that been, huh?

10:01.168 --> 10:02.571
Gosh, I don't know.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.105
A long time ago.

10:04.138 --> 10:05.406

11:03.030 --> 11:07.234
So cool. Where's the brand?

11:07.268 --> 11:10.572
Well, it is such a cool bike
that it doesn't have a name.

11:10.605 --> 11:12.206

-Okay.
-But I got a gift for you.

12:56.410 --> 12:57.945
-Really? What is it?
-Yeah.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.715
Well, I can't tell you.

-Thank you so much.
It's so cool.
-Oh, you're welcome, buddy.

13:14.795 --> 13:17.097
- Daddy, look at this bike.
- Mm-hmm.

13:17.131 --> 13:18.667
Saw it.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.568
How'd you know
he wanted that?

13:20.602 --> 13:22.403
He called me.

13:22.436 --> 13:24.706
We've been talking
a little bit, you know.

13:24.739 --> 13:25.939
So you've been
talking, huh?

13:25.973 --> 13:28.842
He calls his uncle,
you know, and we talk.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.444
Where'd you get
the bike from?

13:30.477 --> 13:34.014
I bought it, Bee.
I got the receipt,
if that's what you're asking.

13:34.048 --> 13:36.216
-How'd you pay for it?
-And then...

13:36.250 --> 13:38.919
Cash. I paid for it
with money, Bee.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.689
What else
I pay for it with?

13:40.722 --> 13:43.558
And was that money
you pay taxes on?

13:43.591 --> 13:45.192
Yeah, you could say that.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.762
It's a stolen bike, Stan.

13:47.796 --> 13:50.864
No, no. I didn't steal
this bike. I bought this.

13:50.898 --> 13:53.802
Okay. Where'd you get
the money from? Huh?

13:53.834 --> 13:55.202
Selling stolen ham?

13:55.235 --> 13:57.071
- Stolen ham.
- Come on.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.205
- Why?
- Bee.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.607
- Why do I have to go back?
- Jim.

13:59.641 --> 14:01.942
Why couldn't you have bought him
a fucking teddy bear, huh?

14:01.975 --> 14:03.243
Why do I have to go back?

14:03.277 --> 14:06.313
Jim, Come on, man.
Let him keep the bike, brother.

14:07.816 --> 14:09.049
I'm with her, man.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.987
Jim... Come on, man!

14:15.690 --> 14:16.924
It's a bike!

14:18.959 --> 14:20.461
It's a fucking bike, man.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.532
I'm gonna leave it here, shit.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.105
I'm gonna leave it
right there.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.340
Fuck you, by the way.

14:39.113 --> 14:40.648
Do you think
he had a good day?

14:43.785 --> 14:45.352
Yeah, he got over it.

14:47.722 --> 14:50.625
- He liked the bike.
- Yeah.

14:52.226 --> 14:54.294
He likes Stan's bike better.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.831
Hm.

14:56.865 --> 14:59.299
There's always
something better out there.

14:59.567 --> 15:00.635
Hm.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.321

-Hey, Dad.
-Hey, buddy.

16:26.588 --> 16:28.723
-How you doing?
-Good.

16:28.756 --> 16:30.390
Yeah? That's good.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.928
Do you want
to play ball with me?

16:33.962 --> 16:36.029
Had a long day.

16:39.667 --> 16:40.702
Okay.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.646
All right,
let's go play ball.

16:51.679 --> 16:52.714
Here you go.

16:56.618 --> 16:57.652
That's it.

17:00.655 --> 17:01.656
Hey.

17:01.689 --> 17:02.524
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

17:02.557 --> 17:05.125
- You bring food?
- Marino's.

17:05.158 --> 17:06.293
- What?
- Yep.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.228
- Ooh.
- Because I'm fancy like that.

17:08.262 --> 17:09.496
Yeah, you are.

17:10.732 --> 17:11.766
That's nice.

17:30.018 --> 17:31.251
Jack.

17:33.387 --> 17:34.421
Jack?

17:35.590 --> 17:36.591
Jack.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.629
Bee! Jack?

17:42.797 --> 17:43.831
Jack?

17:44.532 --> 17:45.667
Bee!

17:46.433 --> 17:47.367
Bee!

17:54.074 --> 17:56.343
Baby? Go call 911.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.547
Jim, get the fucking
phone, now!

18:01.181 --> 18:04.686
Come on. It's okay.

18:04.719 --> 18:06.788
It's okay. Come on.
I just need you to breathe.

18:06.821 --> 18:07.855
Come on.

18:08.623 --> 18:09.757
Come on.

18:12.426 --> 18:16.096
Yeah, my son,
he just fell down.
211 Pinewood Avenue.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.230
Is he breathing?

18:17.264 --> 18:18.766
-Good job. You got it.
-Is he breathing?

18:18.800 --> 18:21.201
-Yeah, he's good.
-Yeah, he's breathing,
but he's shaking now.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.704
-I got you.
-Are you coming?

18:22.737 --> 18:24.672
-It's okay.
-Okay. They're going
to be here soon, okay?

18:24.706 --> 18:25.573
Okay.

18:30.011 --> 18:32.145
I'm not sure
what happened before...

18:32.179 --> 18:33.815
Jim, what happened?
Did he fall?

18:33.848 --> 18:37.384
Yeah, he was...
He just kind of sat down,
and then he just went back.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.353
- And then he just...
And then he started
having a seizure.

18:39.386 --> 18:41.288
Okay. Does he have
a history of seizures?
Do you know?

18:41.321 --> 18:43.256
- No.
- How long did this happen?

18:43.290 --> 18:45.560
-Um, I don't know.
Maybe a minute or two.
-Okay.

18:45.593 --> 18:47.260
- Did he hit his head
by any chance?
No.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.863
-Jim? No.
-No, no.

18:48.896 --> 18:50.898
Okay, pal.

18:50.932 --> 18:53.367
All right, Jack, we're gonna
give you some oxygen, okay?

18:57.872 --> 18:59.239
Nice big breaths,
buddy, okay?

18:59.272 --> 19:00.642
Get out of your way.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.846
- Nearest hospital okay?
- Yeah.

19:04.879 --> 19:07.081
Yes? Who's riding with us?

19:07.115 --> 19:08.382
Um, I will.

19:59.133 --> 20:02.269
<i>Okay. No, I'm just...</i>
<i>I need to understand is all.</i>

20:02.302 --> 20:06.607
<i>So... what you're saying</i>
<i>is that we need to wait</i>

20:06.641 --> 20:12.446
<i>for a prior authorization</i>
<i>to get approval</i>
<i>for the treatment</i>

20:12.479 --> 20:14.849
<i>that this doctor's</i>
<i>recommended to us?</i>

20:14.882 --> 20:16.617
<i>Well...</i>

20:16.651 --> 20:19.187
<i>Well, how long</i>
<i>is that going to take?</i>

20:19.252 --> 20:21.622
Well, we don't have
that kind of time. I...

20:23.124 --> 20:24.424
I'm not raising my voice.

20:24.458 --> 20:26.627
I'm just telling you
that we don't have
that time.

20:29.664 --> 20:33.000
Well, what if we want a...
a different treatment
altogether?

20:33.034 --> 20:34.635
Yeah.

20:34.669 --> 20:37.605
Yes, like out of network,
or whatever.

20:40.942 --> 20:42.375
We're not covered?

20:43.678 --> 20:44.712
At all?

20:47.582 --> 20:50.818
So, you're...

20:50.852 --> 20:54.287
So you're saying that, um,
this is pretty much
our only option?

20:56.791 --> 20:57.825
So that's it, then?

20:59.927 --> 21:01.629
No. Mm-mm. Okay.

21:18.513 --> 21:20.882
I just won't accept it.
I won't.

21:28.890 --> 21:31.893
-The doctor said...
-I don't care
what the doctor said.

21:34.228 --> 21:35.563
He can't die.

21:36.230 --> 21:38.699
I know. I know.

22:00.621 --> 22:02.657
You fly over the city,

22:03.124 --> 22:04.659
across the border.

22:05.259 --> 22:07.028
Up, up you go.

22:07.061 --> 22:08.729
You want to know
where we're going?

22:10.397 --> 22:12.733
To the Gold Cattle Island.

22:13.868 --> 22:15.837
Does that make you happy?

22:15.870 --> 22:17.337
It makes me happy, too,

22:17.839 --> 22:19.040
to see you happy.

22:22.310 --> 22:23.678
Goodnight, little buddy.

22:40.862 --> 22:44.532
So I talked to Jenna
from work, and her mom
went through this treatment

22:44.565 --> 22:47.335
at Boston University Hospital,

22:47.367 --> 22:50.338
and they've got this
cancer center for kids.

22:50.370 --> 22:54.675
Okay? And they've got, like,
this whole different approach
to the way they treat a tumor.

22:54.709 --> 22:56.744
And they've got
this new treatment

22:56.777 --> 23:00.114
where they block
something called...

23:00.147 --> 23:04.919
PRMT5 and that's
supposed to stop
the tumor from growing.

23:06.354 --> 23:08.522
And then they do,
you know, radiation therapy

23:08.556 --> 23:11.491
and drug therapies,
or whatever after that.

23:12.660 --> 23:14.996
But the doctor said
it's spread too much,

23:15.029 --> 23:16.931
and they couldn't take it out.

23:16.964 --> 23:20.835
Well, that's exactly
what they told Jenna's mom,
and she ain't dead yet.

23:22.303 --> 23:24.071
Did you find out
how much it was?

23:25.773 --> 23:29.610
Not exactly, but, um,
they said
anywhere up to like...

23:30.978 --> 23:32.780
$250,000.

23:38.185 --> 23:39.353
I know.

23:39.387 --> 23:41.522
Where are we going
to get that kind of money?

23:43.524 --> 23:44.926
I don't know. I...

23:48.095 --> 23:51.532
I don't know.
We gotta figure it out,
because we're all he's got.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.135
And we got to
take care of him.

23:55.236 --> 23:57.305
I know that. I'm just...

23:57.338 --> 24:01.676
Um, maybe we should
listen to the doctor.

24:01.709 --> 24:05.046
He doesn't have
much time left.

24:05.079 --> 24:08.149
And what? Write him
a fucking bucket list?

24:09.884 --> 24:14.021
Raise money so he can
fucking skydive
over the Grand Canyon?

24:15.823 --> 24:16.757
Huh?

24:18.292 --> 24:20.460
What if that's
the only choice we got?

24:23.230 --> 24:25.766
I'm not giving up on him.

24:25.800 --> 24:28.536
And you promised
to take care of us.
You remember that?

24:28.569 --> 24:30.171
Yeah, I do.

24:30.204 --> 24:33.774
I'm just... I'm just trying
to make the right decision.

24:45.720 --> 24:47.688
I don't have
that kind of money.

24:47.722 --> 24:50.291
I'm barely making it
month by month.

24:50.324 --> 24:52.226
We just got
the new trucks.

24:52.259 --> 24:54.428
I'm maxed out financially.

24:54.462 --> 24:55.796
What do you
want me to do?

24:56.330 --> 24:57.565
I don't know.

25:04.005 --> 25:05.506
How about the bank?

25:05.539 --> 25:08.242
Yeah. We're going there
this afternoon.

25:08.275 --> 25:10.111
Just need more options.

25:10.144 --> 25:13.247
Oh, I'm sure they'll help.
Do you need some time off?

25:14.115 --> 25:15.449
No, I don't need time off.

25:15.483 --> 25:17.651
I need to make
some goddamn money, James.

25:17.685 --> 25:21.188
I mean, no long hauls.
But I have to work.

25:23.024 --> 25:24.058
I understand.

25:28.095 --> 25:29.663
How about the Houston run?

25:29.697 --> 25:31.766
Would that work for you
for a while?

25:32.800 --> 25:34.935
Yeah, that's a start.

25:36.771 --> 25:38.906
- He'll be all right,
you'll see.

25:39.673 --> 25:41.242
Yeah? How do you know?

25:43.544 --> 25:45.146
It's a lot of money.

25:45.179 --> 25:46.213
Yeah.

25:54.355 --> 25:55.524
Fucking assholes.

25:55.556 --> 25:57.358
$2,000 in credit.
Are you fucking kidding me?

25:57.391 --> 25:59.960
What are you yelling at me for?
I wasn't the one in there.

26:01.429 --> 26:02.663
My mom better help.

26:02.696 --> 26:04.298
I know she can
sell that house.

26:04.331 --> 26:06.167
-Fuck's sake...
-No, don't, Jimmy.

26:07.968 --> 26:10.671
This is
too much, darling.

26:10.704 --> 26:12.807
Well, you must have been
cooking all day.

26:12.840 --> 26:14.275
Almost.

26:14.308 --> 26:15.609
-Oh.
-Whoa! Hmm.

26:15.643 --> 26:18.979
-Dean, would you like a beer?
-I would. Damn nice.

26:21.382 --> 26:22.616
Okay.

26:27.121 --> 26:32.527
Hey, Mom, Dean.
Uh, we've got something
we need to talk to you about.

26:32.561 --> 26:34.529
You're not divorcing,
are you?

26:34.563 --> 26:36.497
No, we're not
divorcing, Sue.

26:36.531 --> 26:39.400
- Oh.
- Jack is sick, Mom.

26:39.433 --> 26:40.569
Sick? How?

26:40.601 --> 26:43.070
Sick like he's got
a tumor in his brain.

26:44.939 --> 26:47.842
Look, we found a treatment
in Boston, okay?

26:47.875 --> 26:49.176
And they got
real good doctors.

26:49.210 --> 26:52.246
And they can give Jack
a real good chance.

26:52.279 --> 26:53.614
But we're not covered.

26:53.647 --> 26:54.949
And it's expensive.

26:55.916 --> 26:58.385
So we're maybe hoping
that y'all can help out.

27:00.087 --> 27:01.255
With money?

27:03.224 --> 27:04.526
Yes, Dean.

27:04.559 --> 27:06.427
Money would be helpful
in our situation.

27:06.460 --> 27:09.730
Better than a hug.
So the cancer
doesn't spread anymore.

27:09.763 --> 27:12.399
Well... how much is it?

27:13.467 --> 27:14.969
$50,000 to start.

27:15.604 --> 27:16.837
Oh.

27:18.139 --> 27:20.307
You know we don't have
that kind of money.

27:24.513 --> 27:26.046
What about Grandpa's house?

27:29.750 --> 27:33.020
-Hon, we can't get rid
of that damn house.
-Mm-mm.

27:34.955 --> 27:36.957
There's more debt
than money in it.

27:37.958 --> 27:41.596
You fucking owe me, Mom.
You know that.

27:41.630 --> 27:44.131
Hey, don't you talk
to your mama that way.

27:44.165 --> 27:47.368
Like what, Dean?
Don't tell me how
to talk to my mama.

27:47.401 --> 27:48.603
You know what?
Just get the fuck

27:48.637 --> 27:50.037
-out of my house.
-Bee, Bee.

27:51.906 --> 27:53.274
Thank you for dinner.

27:55.209 --> 27:56.177
Come on.

27:57.579 --> 27:58.712
Shit.

28:31.613 --> 28:33.147
$73.

28:33.180 --> 28:34.215
Thanks, Dean.

28:35.684 --> 28:37.985
Are you
fucking kidding me?

28:40.087 --> 28:42.990
Well, at least we know
they're not coming back
anytime soon.

28:43.023 --> 28:44.191
So what?

28:45.926 --> 28:47.828
You know, I'm trying
my hardest here,

28:47.861 --> 28:50.030
and I mean,
what the fuck are you doing?

28:50.699 --> 28:52.166
What are you talking about?

28:52.199 --> 28:55.202
-I mean, does he
even matter to you?
-Don't fucking say that.

28:55.236 --> 28:57.304
Well, then,
man the fuck up, Jim.

28:57.338 --> 28:59.907
What do you want me to do?
Go steal my mother's
welfare checks?

28:59.940 --> 29:01.509
How is that going
to help anything?

29:04.579 --> 29:05.580
Bee.

29:05.614 --> 29:06.715
No. You know what?

29:06.747 --> 29:08.949
You stay here
and you take care of Jack.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.252
Oh, what, you angry?

29:12.186 --> 29:13.153
Good.

30:07.441 --> 30:09.009
Dad? Dad?

30:09.043 --> 30:12.580
-Mm.
-Your phone. Your phone.

30:22.757 --> 30:24.058
Yeah?

30:27.729 --> 30:28.962
What?

31:01.929 --> 31:04.766
Hey, Jim,
top floor, brother.

31:04.799 --> 31:06.066
All right,
take care of Jack.

31:06.100 --> 31:07.968
-What, he's in here?
-Take care of Jack.

32:03.625 --> 32:06.360
Get up and let's go.
Come on.

32:08.495 --> 32:09.597
Jack's in the car.

32:13.233 --> 32:15.570
What the fuck, man?
She's my wife.

32:16.671 --> 32:18.205
She's my fucking wife!

33:26.674 --> 33:28.141
How much did you make?

33:33.413 --> 33:36.116
I need some extra cash.
Can you hook me up?

33:37.150 --> 33:40.655
Shit, I mean,
I got a little bit,

33:40.688 --> 33:44.926
but I spend that shit
as soon as I get it,
you know that.

33:44.959 --> 33:48.428
Can you set up a meeting
with people
needing transportation?

33:52.800 --> 33:54.234
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:56.838 --> 33:58.238
Yeah, I know some people.

33:58.272 --> 34:00.307
They are not
nice people though, brother.

34:01.408 --> 34:03.645
-Bee is not gonna like that.
-I don't care, man.

34:05.178 --> 34:06.413
I don't care.

34:09.851 --> 34:11.285
What's going on, bro?

34:12.921 --> 34:14.388
Bee's off the hook
out there in the club.

34:14.421 --> 34:16.824
-You can't be letting her
go out there like...
-Jack is sick.

34:17.992 --> 34:19.159
What?

34:19.594 --> 34:21.629
He's got cancer.

34:21.663 --> 34:24.799
She's just trying
to make some money,
trying to help him out.

34:31.171 --> 34:32.507
How bad is he?

34:37.210 --> 34:38.513
It's pretty bad.

34:40.548 --> 34:42.082
Oh, shit, bro.

34:47.522 --> 34:51.325
Oh... fuck.
I'm sorry, brother.

34:54.227 --> 34:56.430
Finally invited me out here,
and it's for this.

34:57.665 --> 34:58.733
Oh, shit.

35:05.673 --> 35:08.241
<i>You're gonna meet a guy</i>
<i>with a red truck, all right?</i>

35:08.710 --> 35:09.577
Okay.

35:09.611 --> 35:12.179
<i>He's going to take you</i>
<i>to a meeting.</i>

35:12.212 --> 35:16.651
<i>You just let the other guys</i>
<i>do their thing,</i>
<i>and you go on with them.</i>

36:02.597 --> 36:03.698
Cover your eyes.

36:41.002 --> 36:42.570
You can go ahead
and take it off.

37:25.947 --> 37:28.516
-I'm Jim.
-I know who you are.
Have a seat.

37:34.254 --> 37:35.723
So, what are you
doing here?

37:36.758 --> 37:39.894
You didn't talk
to my brother? Stan?

37:39.927 --> 37:41.428
He tell you
what we do here?

37:41.763 --> 37:43.430
No.

37:43.463 --> 37:45.566
But you have
a pretty good idea, right?

37:45.600 --> 37:46.934
Yup, I do.

37:54.407 --> 37:56.778
I'll cross whatever
over the checkpoint.

38:00.280 --> 38:01.616
So here's how it is.

38:02.683 --> 38:04.619
You know what
happens to you

38:04.652 --> 38:07.420
if you fuck me over, right?
We come for your kid.

38:07.922 --> 38:09.524
And your wife.

38:09.557 --> 38:11.959
You understand?
That enough information?

38:12.860 --> 38:13.928
Yeah.

38:14.729 --> 38:15.763
All right.

38:17.430 --> 38:19.534
But I want to make
one thing clear, though.

38:21.736 --> 38:24.972
You ever threaten
my family again,
or come close to them,

38:25.006 --> 38:26.574
and I'm gonna
fucking kill you.

38:30.377 --> 38:31.612
That's good to know.

38:33.281 --> 38:34.515
Here's how it works.

38:35.183 --> 38:36.818
We tell you where to stop.

38:36.851 --> 38:40.955
When you do, you walk away
from your truck, you get
a bite to eat maybe,

38:40.988 --> 38:42.657
or you take a piss.

38:42.690 --> 38:44.391
When your truck
is visible again,

38:44.424 --> 38:45.693
that means that we're off.

38:45.726 --> 38:48.229
Maybe you carry.
Maybe you don't.

38:48.262 --> 38:49.931
When you get across
a checkpoint,

38:49.964 --> 38:52.667
we'll send you a message,
tell you where to stop.

38:52.700 --> 38:55.570
You do the whole thing again.
Walk away from your truck,

38:55.603 --> 38:56.838
wait till it's clear.

38:58.272 --> 39:00.340
When you get
back to your truck,

39:00.373 --> 39:01.709
you check the glove
compartment.

39:01.742 --> 39:04.612
Your payment will be in there
with a new phone.

39:05.279 --> 39:06.647
Get rid of the old one.

39:11.285 --> 39:13.521
And don't do
anything else on it.

39:15.556 --> 39:17.024
You keep
the battery charged.

39:18.192 --> 39:19.426
That's it.

39:20.194 --> 39:21.428
Easy-peasy.

39:24.131 --> 39:26.000
-Okay.
-Time to go to work.

39:27.168 --> 39:28.669
Now get the fuck
out of my truck.

40:39.640 --> 40:40.708
What are you carrying?

40:40.741 --> 40:42.176
Uh, just stuff from work.

40:42.209 --> 40:43.678
-From work?
-Yeah, McAllen.

40:43.711 --> 40:45.980
-You got your paperwork?
-Yup, right here.

40:49.817 --> 40:52.053
Right.
Just a second,
hold on.

41:09.036 --> 41:10.470
Where you going?

41:10.504 --> 41:11.639
I'm gonna go to Houston.

41:11.672 --> 41:12.873
Houston?
What part of Houston?

41:12.907 --> 41:15.176
-Phillipsons, east side.
-East side?

41:15.209 --> 41:16.143
Yeah.

41:17.345 --> 41:19.013
All right. Carry on.

41:19.780 --> 41:20.748
All right.

41:34.195 --> 41:35.495
Yeah.

42:41.962 --> 42:42.930
Got a light?

42:50.304 --> 42:51.338
Where you headed?

42:52.306 --> 42:54.642
-Houston.
-Sounds good.

42:54.675 --> 42:57.812
Ain't too far. I'm headed
all the way up to Toronto.

42:57.845 --> 43:01.516
That's a long haul.
What's it like up there?

43:01.550 --> 43:03.484
It seems pretty nice,
the little I've seen.

43:03.518 --> 43:04.885
People seem friendly.

43:04.919 --> 43:06.954
It's a little different,
but kind of the same,
you know?

43:06.987 --> 43:07.888
Hmm.

43:08.889 --> 43:09.790
Yeah.

43:10.391 --> 43:11.859
What about Houston?

43:13.594 --> 43:14.829
It's Houston.

43:21.335 --> 43:23.003
-Have a good one.
-You, too.

43:51.232 --> 43:52.333
Where'd you get this from?

43:52.700 --> 43:53.934
From James.

43:54.802 --> 43:56.737
-Oh, yeah?
-It's a loan.

44:00.975 --> 44:02.810
Well, you tell him
we'll pay him back.

44:05.045 --> 44:06.080
I did.

44:11.385 --> 44:12.419
Where is he?

44:13.588 --> 44:14.822
Sleeping.

44:14.855 --> 44:18.492
He's exhausted.
Been tough on him.

44:18.527 --> 44:21.228
Yeah, I bet.

44:21.262 --> 44:24.698
<i>Gonna give them a call</i>
<i>and see if we can get</i>
<i>the first flight out tomorrow.</i>

44:24.732 --> 44:27.168
<i>- Yeah?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

44:27.201 --> 44:30.137
<i>I called them and said</i>
<i>we'd figure it out.</i>

44:30.171 --> 44:32.139
<i>And they said once</i>
<i>we did give them a call,</i>

44:32.173 --> 44:35.142
<i>they'd get us in</i>
<i>to see the doctor</i>
<i>right away.</i>

44:35.176 --> 44:36.210
<i>That's good.</i>

44:48.923 --> 44:50.157
All right, buddy.

44:51.025 --> 44:51.959
Huh?

44:52.459 --> 44:53.694
Give me a hug, bud.

44:55.996 --> 44:58.365
You'll be back soon.

44:58.399 --> 44:59.133
-Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

44:59.166 --> 45:00.669
You be good
to your mom, okay?

45:00.701 --> 45:01.936
Okay.

45:03.804 --> 45:05.906
Take good care of him.

45:05.940 --> 45:07.408
Yeah.

45:07.441 --> 45:11.278
Now, there's food
in the fridge, and try to keep
those plants alive, okay?

45:11.312 --> 45:12.880
-I will.
-Okay.

45:32.800 --> 45:35.570
Dr. Garrett,
this is Beatrice,
Jack's mom.

45:35.604 --> 45:36.804
Okay. Thank you.

45:36.837 --> 45:39.740
-Have a seat.
-Thanks. Nice to meet you.

45:39.773 --> 45:41.942
I really don't like desks
a whole lot,

45:41.976 --> 45:44.378
because I think they kind of
put distance between people.

45:44.411 --> 45:45.580
But it's the situation,

45:45.614 --> 45:48.583
makes it easier, you know,
for us to have a conversation.

45:48.617 --> 45:50.619
<i>And I want you</i>
<i>to feel comfortable.</i>

45:50.652 --> 45:53.187
<i>So tell me,</i>
<i>what's going on?</i>

45:53.220 --> 45:58.859
<i>Um, well, after</i>
<i>Jack's incident at home,</i>
<i>where he had a seizure,</i>

45:58.892 --> 46:00.861
<i>and then we took him</i>
<i>to the hospital,</i>

46:00.894 --> 46:04.164
<i>um, they ended up telling us</i>
<i>about his condition</i>

46:04.198 --> 46:08.002
<i>and unfortunately, at home,</i>
<i>just our options with insurance</i>

46:08.035 --> 46:11.038
<i>and as far as even getting</i>
<i>the right treatment,</i>

46:11.071 --> 46:13.974
<i>or treatment</i>
<i>I was comfortable with, um,</i>

46:14.008 --> 46:15.876
<i>there just wasn't much</i>
<i>of an option there.</i>

46:15.909 --> 46:19.213
So that's when we started
to look into other things,

46:19.246 --> 46:20.414
and found you guys.

46:26.020 --> 46:28.188
<i>Well, I'm really glad</i>
<i>you made the trip.</i>

46:28.222 --> 46:31.892
<i>Now, I notice that Jack</i>
<i>didn't come with you today.</i>

46:31.925 --> 46:35.996
<i>Um, how much does Jack know</i>
<i>about what's going on?</i>

46:36.030 --> 46:38.832
<i>We told him</i>
<i>that we just...</i>

46:38.866 --> 46:41.035
<i>you're going to treat him</i>
<i>for the seizures.</i>

46:41.835 --> 46:44.838
Yeah. I feel like, um,
we just...

46:44.872 --> 46:47.174
I think it would be better
for his mental state

46:47.207 --> 46:50.210
if he didn't know
for the time being.

46:50.244 --> 46:53.748
Anyways, I just I want
him to stay really strong,

46:53.782 --> 46:56.817
<i>and I just feel like</i>
<i>this is the best way.</i>

47:00.354 --> 47:03.924
<i>I want you</i>
<i>to know that you are not</i>
<i>alone in this.</i>

47:03.957 --> 47:05.993
<i>This is a team effort.</i>

47:06.026 --> 47:10.632
<i>It's you, me, and Jack</i>
<i>working together</i>

47:10.665 --> 47:16.036
<i>to beat this, make it happen,</i>
<i>make it go away,</i>
<i>and make him better.</i>

47:17.572 --> 47:18.807
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

47:18.839 --> 47:20.341
Hey, Jack.

47:20.374 --> 47:21.275
How you doing?

47:21.308 --> 47:23.511
-Good.
-What, are you in
a hotel room?

47:24.011 --> 47:25.647
<i>No. Where are we?</i>

47:25.680 --> 47:27.782
<i>Hospital. Yeah.</i>

47:27.816 --> 47:30.284
<i>We just wanted to check in</i>
<i>and say hi.</i>

47:30.317 --> 47:34.556
<i>Jack's going for his</i>
<i>first treatment tonight,</i>
<i>so...</i>

47:34.589 --> 47:36.256
How do you feel
about that?

47:36.957 --> 47:37.925
<i>I don't know.</i>

47:37.958 --> 47:40.094
It's okay to
be nervous, okay?

47:40.494 --> 47:41.962
<i>Hmm.</i>

47:41.995 --> 47:44.098
<i>Okay. Well, I'm gonna</i>
<i>go talk to your daddy</i>
<i>for a second, okay?</i>

47:44.131 --> 47:45.899
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-Okay. You wanna say bye?</i>

47:45.933 --> 47:48.135
<i>-Bye, Dad.</i>
-Bye.

47:54.375 --> 47:55.643
<i>-Hey.</i>
-Hey.

47:55.677 --> 47:57.812
<i>Um, sorry.</i>

47:57.846 --> 47:59.246
<i>I want to talk to you</i>
<i>about the money.</i>

47:59.279 --> 48:02.082
<i>Are you gonna be able to put</i>
<i>more money in the account?</i>

48:02.116 --> 48:04.151
I thought
we worked that out.

48:04.184 --> 48:06.320
<i>No, it's just,</i>
<i>it's the first installment,</i>

48:06.353 --> 48:09.022
<i>so it looks like we're</i>
<i>probably gonna need, um,</i>

48:09.056 --> 48:11.425
<i>same amount,</i>
<i>I'm guessing.</i>

48:11.458 --> 48:13.494
Yeah, I can put it
in your account tonight.

48:14.829 --> 48:16.598
<i>Okay, good.</i>

48:16.631 --> 48:19.701
<i>And we're going to have</i>
<i>to be here about a month,</i>

48:19.734 --> 48:21.636
<i>they're saying right now,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

48:21.669 --> 48:23.337
Yeah, I figured as much.

48:24.905 --> 48:26.206
<i>I love you.</i>

48:26.741 --> 48:27.975
Yeah, I love you, too.

48:51.231 --> 48:52.399
Hey.

48:52.433 --> 48:53.735
Yeah. Put in an order.

48:55.737 --> 48:57.171
Okay. How much is it?

48:59.072 --> 49:01.442
<i>Hey, hey,</i>
<i>hey, hey, hey.</i>

49:01.475 --> 49:03.678
You go to the window
and who do you see?

49:03.711 --> 49:05.212
<i>The Swamp Lion.</i>

49:08.482 --> 49:09.551
<i>He looks weak.</i>

49:10.585 --> 49:11.553
<i>I know.</i>

49:13.020 --> 49:14.589
<i>I wish you were here.</i>

49:14.622 --> 49:15.690
Yeah. Me, too.

49:19.993 --> 49:22.095
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>I'm just tired.</i>

49:22.129 --> 49:25.600
Tired? There ain't time
to be tired, dummy.

49:25.633 --> 49:27.434
Get up off that bed now!

49:29.036 --> 49:31.506
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

49:36.343 --> 49:38.513
<i>Doctor said</i>
<i>his numbers are up.</i>

49:38.546 --> 49:40.715
<i>Treatments cost</i>
<i>more money, so...</i>

49:49.156 --> 49:50.424
-How's it going?
-Good. How are you?

49:50.457 --> 49:52.594
-Good. Where are you
going today, sir?
-Houston.

50:03.738 --> 50:06.240
You don't want to talk about
what's going on over there?

50:07.341 --> 50:10.477
<i>The nurses said I was</i>
<i>really sick with cancer.</i>

50:13.548 --> 50:16.049
<i>I heard them say it</i>
<i>in another room.</i>

50:17.519 --> 50:20.522
They must have been talking
about somebody else, okay?

50:21.623 --> 50:23.490
You're not that sick.

50:23.525 --> 50:28.161
You think if you were that sick,
I'd be over here
and you'd be over there?

50:29.396 --> 50:32.366
You know, I'd be there,
right next to you.

50:33.868 --> 50:35.135
Okay?

50:35.670 --> 50:37.337
<i>I'm not stupid.</i>

50:38.438 --> 50:40.340
<i>They were talking about me.</i>

50:47.414 --> 50:49.551
Jack's not responding
to the treatments.

50:51.485 --> 50:53.755
So he needs new ones,
better ones,

50:53.788 --> 50:56.290
and they're expensive
and we can't afford it.

51:00.895 --> 51:02.262
Fuck. I'm sorry, brother.

51:04.264 --> 51:06.133
I just need to
make more money.

51:09.971 --> 51:11.171
How, uh...

51:13.073 --> 51:14.274
How fast?

51:15.475 --> 51:16.476
Fast.

51:22.016 --> 51:23.250
All right.

51:24.719 --> 51:26.521
I think I know somebody.

51:26.554 --> 51:29.724
You know, they'll take
a little bit of a cut,
but it's doable.

51:35.295 --> 51:36.664
I think he might die.

51:40.400 --> 51:42.369
And I can't breathe
when I'm not working,

51:42.402 --> 51:44.772
I'm not making money,
and I'm not trying to help him.

51:45.974 --> 51:47.441
And it could be
for nothing.

51:49.109 --> 51:50.878
And I haven't seen him.

51:50.912 --> 51:53.548
And I'm just
fucking scared, Stan.
I'm fucking scared.

51:58.753 --> 51:59.787
All right, brother.

52:01.121 --> 52:02.422
I'm gonna get you
out of here. All right?

52:02.456 --> 52:04.525
Gonna get outta here.
Come on.

52:04.559 --> 52:05.893
Come on.

52:08.663 --> 52:11.933
Hello, ladies.
How you guys doing?

52:11.966 --> 52:13.367
-Hey, mama.
-Hey.

52:14.068 --> 52:15.536
How you doing?

52:16.436 --> 52:18.138
Y'all ever met
my brother before?

52:18.171 --> 52:19.941
-No. Hi.
-Hey, this is Jim.

52:19.974 --> 52:21.609
-Lynette.
-Nice to meet you.

52:21.643 --> 52:23.878
Don't be shy, brother,
you can say it.

52:23.911 --> 52:26.413
At least smile a little bit...

52:27.481 --> 52:29.483
-Hello, Charlie.
-Hi, baby.

52:29.517 --> 52:31.284
How you doing?

52:31.318 --> 52:33.453
Come on, I'm sure
you know my brother.

52:33.487 --> 52:35.322
Yeah, I know your brother.

52:35.657 --> 52:36.624
Come on.

52:38.325 --> 52:40.728
- Bye, ladies.
- Bye.

52:44.264 --> 52:45.800
What are you doing here?

52:45.833 --> 52:49.737
Well...
we need a little more money.

52:51.105 --> 52:54.142
You okay? What for?

52:54.174 --> 52:58.311
My... My son is sick.
He needs treatment.

52:59.212 --> 53:00.581
Is crossing not enough?

53:01.082 --> 53:02.315
No.

53:02.349 --> 53:04.585
Shit.
I'm sorry
to hear that.

53:07.187 --> 53:08.355
Can you help?

53:10.424 --> 53:13.628
-I mean, it depends.
-On what?

53:13.661 --> 53:15.763
If you're willing
to fuck with a boss.

53:16.831 --> 53:18.099
Shit.

53:18.132 --> 53:19.433
Are you that dumb?

53:20.333 --> 53:21.803
I think my brother's dumb.

53:21.836 --> 53:24.304
Yeah, I'm pretty fucking stupid.
I'm right here, right?

53:24.337 --> 53:26.206
This shit runs
the family, baby.

53:26.239 --> 53:27.508
Yeah, all right.

53:27.542 --> 53:30.210
All right,
so how does it work,
or what do we do?

53:35.616 --> 53:36.551
Girls.

53:36.584 --> 53:38.753
- Yes?
- Can you get out?

53:38.786 --> 53:39.654
Yeah.

53:42.156 --> 53:45.727
Well... you let me
in your truck,

53:47.360 --> 53:49.329
I skim a little of the stuff
they put in there,

53:49.362 --> 53:51.498
and then I get out
before you deliver.

53:51.532 --> 53:53.167
That's it.

53:53.201 --> 53:54.635
-That's it?
-That's it.

53:55.435 --> 53:57.404
We'll split 50-50.

53:58.906 --> 53:59.941
We got a deal?

54:02.710 --> 54:03.745
Yeah, we got a deal.

54:04.244 --> 54:06.647
Don't fuck it up.

54:06.681 --> 54:09.349
Oh,
he will be all right.
- Now get out.

54:09.382 --> 54:11.552
Yeah, I like you, too.

54:11.586 --> 54:13.788
I'll be right here.

54:13.821 --> 54:15.923
- Get out!
We'll be at
Romeo's later.

54:15.957 --> 54:17.725
- Get out.
- Oh, shit.

54:19.026 --> 54:22.230
-Cool? That's cool.
Where's your old man?
-Stupid.

54:22.262 --> 54:23.564
- You need another beer?
- I'm good.

54:23.598 --> 54:25.800
-All right. You want a shot?
-No, I don't need a shot.

54:25.833 --> 54:26.667
Need some elbow courage?

54:26.701 --> 54:30.171
No, we got
plenty of shots. I'm good.

54:30.204 --> 54:32.173
Just leave me alone, man.

54:32.206 --> 54:34.809
- Fuck it.
- Fuck it.

54:37.945 --> 54:39.412
Got a cigarette?

54:42.150 --> 54:43.383
That I do.

54:44.484 --> 54:46.654
Jim.

54:47.889 --> 54:50.124
Charlie...

54:50.158 --> 54:52.459
You are nothing
like your brother.

54:53.426 --> 54:55.596
No, he talks too much.

54:55.630 --> 54:57.965
Oh, yeah. A lot of bullshit.

54:58.699 --> 54:59.700
Yeah.

55:09.442 --> 55:10.678
You're beautiful.

55:12.713 --> 55:14.048
Wow.

55:14.081 --> 55:15.983
Well, now you sound like him.

55:18.119 --> 55:19.386
Sorry.

55:19.419 --> 55:21.989
No, no, no, I like it.

55:26.928 --> 55:28.029
So, Jim...

55:28.729 --> 55:30.463
Yeah, Charlie.

55:30.497 --> 55:32.465
What is it that you want?

55:36.137 --> 55:37.505
You want another drink?

55:42.210 --> 55:44.812
Yeah. Come on.
Let's have another drink.

57:23.844 --> 57:25.579
-Hello, sir. How you doing?
-Doin' good.

57:25.613 --> 57:27.581
-Where you coming from?
-McAllen.

57:27.615 --> 57:29.150
What d'you got
in the load?

57:29.183 --> 57:30.384
Uh, just stuff from work.

57:30.418 --> 57:31.919
Okay. Where'd you
pick it up from?

57:31.953 --> 57:34.388
-McAllen, at work.
-Okay. You usually
pick it up there?

57:34.422 --> 57:36.424
-Yep.
-You doing all right, sir?

57:36.456 --> 57:37.658
Yeah, I'm doing all right.
Yeah.

57:37.692 --> 57:39.760
Okay. Might we take
a look at your load?

57:39.794 --> 57:41.494
-Yeah. Don't mind.
-Okay.

57:41.529 --> 57:43.230
Just do me a favor.

57:43.264 --> 57:45.166
Just travel to the left
over here and we'll be
with you in a few seconds.

58:01.782 --> 58:03.184
Can you step off
the truck, sir?

58:11.125 --> 58:12.893
All right.
Step over here,
sir, please.

58:12.927 --> 58:14.228
-Oh.
-Yep.

58:22.370 --> 58:24.238
-You all right?
-Yeah. Yeah, man.

58:24.271 --> 58:28.142
My AC broke, you know,
I'm actually sweating
like a pig.

58:31.078 --> 58:34.015
-This is where you usually
pick it up from?
-Yeah, right there.

58:34.048 --> 58:36.550
-Did you load it up yourself?
-No, no.
Somebody else loaded it up.

58:36.584 --> 58:38.185
Same thing every day.

58:38.219 --> 58:39.854
Dogs look kind of agitated.

58:39.887 --> 58:42.456
-Yeah, it might be the heat.
-What was that?

58:42.490 --> 58:44.892
I said maybe
they don't like the heat.

58:45.192 --> 58:46.227
Yeah.

58:59.840 --> 59:02.476
-Right, sir.
You're good to go.
-All right.

59:02.511 --> 59:04.311
-You guys have a good one.
-You, too.

1:00:21.422 --> 1:00:23.592
-Hey!
-Hi.

1:00:23.624 --> 1:00:25.126
What the fuck
you doing here?

1:00:25.860 --> 1:00:26.894
I...

1:00:28.262 --> 1:00:29.830
I got your 12K.

1:01:43.938 --> 1:01:46.440
Hi. Come right in.

1:01:46.473 --> 1:01:48.075
So how's my grandson?

1:01:49.243 --> 1:01:52.179
You know,
he's hanging in there.
He's all right.

1:01:53.480 --> 1:01:58.485
Well, I want to do something,
and I want you to have this.

1:02:04.024 --> 1:02:07.261
No, Ma, I don't need
the money, okay?

1:02:07.294 --> 1:02:08.729
Yes, you do.

1:02:08.762 --> 1:02:11.165
You need the money
for your medicine. I'm not
going to take that, okay?

1:02:11.198 --> 1:02:12.299
We're covered.

1:02:14.603 --> 1:02:16.837
-Well...
-Hey.

1:02:19.641 --> 1:02:22.076
How about I buy your car?

1:02:22.544 --> 1:02:23.911
Okay?

1:02:23.944 --> 1:02:26.880
Give you a little money,
you can pay for your meds.

1:02:26.914 --> 1:02:28.650
-You'll be all right.
-You want my car?

1:02:28.683 --> 1:02:29.850
Mm-hmm.

1:02:30.417 --> 1:02:32.186
I just need a spare car.

1:02:32.219 --> 1:02:35.322
We're driving Jack around
all over the place now.
So...

1:02:36.790 --> 1:02:39.628
What do you think?
You get some money.
You're not driving, right?

1:02:39.661 --> 1:02:41.829
-No.
-Still running?

1:02:41.862 --> 1:02:44.231
Last time I checked,
it was running.

1:02:44.265 --> 1:02:45.499
All right.

1:02:47.901 --> 1:02:49.136
There you go.

1:02:58.546 --> 1:03:01.115
What's really going on here?

1:03:01.148 --> 1:03:04.218
Nothing's going on.
I need a spare car
and you need your medicine.

1:03:04.785 --> 1:03:06.020
We both win.

1:03:07.656 --> 1:03:10.190
-Where are the keys?
-In the drawer.

1:04:37.911 --> 1:04:40.214
Hold on one second.
He's coming out.

1:04:43.484 --> 1:04:46.053
Okay, come here, slowly.

1:04:46.688 --> 1:04:48.088
Let's have a look at you.

1:04:53.994 --> 1:04:57.398
Hey, Jack.
How you doing, buddy?

1:05:00.802 --> 1:05:02.202
You look sad.

1:05:04.773 --> 1:05:06.140
<i>I'm okay, Jack.</i>

1:05:11.345 --> 1:05:13.648
<i>Can you tell me</i>
<i>the rest of the story?</i>

1:05:16.651 --> 1:05:17.585
Yeah.

1:05:18.853 --> 1:05:21.623
Yeah. Where were we?

1:05:23.591 --> 1:05:25.192
<i>The hot air balloon.</i>

1:05:26.561 --> 1:05:29.196
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I remember.

1:05:34.968 --> 1:05:37.004
Okay, So...

1:05:38.238 --> 1:05:40.842
they're all in the balloon,

1:05:40.875 --> 1:05:42.644
flying high up in the sky.

1:05:45.279 --> 1:05:47.181
You look and
you see the island.

1:05:48.650 --> 1:05:49.717
And you say...

1:05:50.819 --> 1:05:52.085
"How do we get in?"

1:05:52.821 --> 1:05:55.690
"Get in?"
the hummingbird says.

1:05:55.723 --> 1:05:59.159
And then you realize
there's something that the
hummingbird didn't think about.

1:06:02.196 --> 1:06:05.199
<i>Before you can say, "No,"</i>

1:06:05.232 --> 1:06:07.367
<i>Swamp Lion runs up</i>
<i>all the way to the roof,</i>

1:06:07.401 --> 1:06:11.004
puts bombs on there
and he lights the wick
and...

1:06:11.038 --> 1:06:15.142
Everything's going crazy
in your mind and you say,
"Everybody, get down!"

1:06:15.175 --> 1:06:16.678
And all the hummingbirds
fly to the corners

1:06:16.711 --> 1:06:19.881
and you look at the Swamp Lion
and you say, "Swamp Lion, why?"

1:06:19.914 --> 1:06:21.649
Swamp Lion says,
"Because it's good."

1:06:21.683 --> 1:06:26.554
And you say, "No!"
And all of a sudden,
it just explodes!

1:06:26.588 --> 1:06:30.157
The roof flies off,
the sun comes down,

1:06:31.124 --> 1:06:33.227
blinds your eyes.

1:06:33.260 --> 1:06:35.195
You can't really
see that well.

1:06:35.763 --> 1:06:37.264
You look around.

1:06:38.933 --> 1:06:43.036
<i>And then you see him</i>
<i>lying on the ground,</i>
<i>and he looks at you.</i>

1:06:44.906 --> 1:06:46.574
And he gives you
that big smile.

1:06:48.643 --> 1:06:51.345
The one that only
the Swamp Lion
can give you.

1:06:56.985 --> 1:06:59.721
I'm going to die,
aren't I?

1:07:09.597 --> 1:07:10.632
It's okay, Dad.

1:07:12.667 --> 1:07:16.270
<i>You and me,</i>
<i>we gotta keep fighting,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

1:07:19.439 --> 1:07:20.474
Okay.

1:07:25.212 --> 1:07:28.181
Don't tell Mom we...
we talked about this.

1:07:31.351 --> 1:07:32.386
Okay.

1:07:39.493 --> 1:07:40.662
Sweet dreams.

1:07:48.670 --> 1:07:49.737
<i>Sweet dreams, son.</i>

1:10:30.164 --> 1:10:31.264
Hey.

1:10:33.467 --> 1:10:34.969
What are you doing here?

1:10:35.937 --> 1:10:37.505
I didn't see you
at your house.

1:10:39.006 --> 1:10:40.307
You mean
you couldn't get in?

1:10:40.340 --> 1:10:42.476
Something like that.

1:10:45.146 --> 1:10:46.246
Come on.

1:10:47.414 --> 1:10:49.282
I'm making us
a lot of money.

1:10:49.917 --> 1:10:51.351
Your wife must be happy.

1:10:52.252 --> 1:10:53.688
It's a bad idea.

1:11:45.072 --> 1:11:46.339
Hey.

1:11:47.108 --> 1:11:48.308
<i>Hey.</i>

1:11:51.612 --> 1:11:53.781
<i>-Can you hear me?</i>
-Yeah. Yeah.

1:11:55.750 --> 1:12:00.221
<i>Um, well, it looks like</i>
<i>we're getting to come home</i>
<i>for the weekend.</i>

1:12:00.254 --> 1:12:02.824
<i>He's doing better, Jim.</i>
<i>He's been eating.</i>

1:12:02.857 --> 1:12:04.225
<i>Numbers are down.</i>

1:12:04.258 --> 1:12:06.928
<i>They told us</i>
<i>it'd be good for him</i>
<i>to come home and see you.</i>

1:12:07.728 --> 1:12:08.896
He's better?

1:12:09.897 --> 1:12:12.133
<i>Yeah, he's doing better.</i>

1:12:12.166 --> 1:12:15.903
Thank you, God.

1:12:15.937 --> 1:12:19.339
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1:12:23.410 --> 1:12:25.345
<i>So we'll see you soon,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

1:12:26.479 --> 1:12:27.849
All right.

1:12:29.349 --> 1:12:30.918
<i>-Hey.</i>
-Yeah.

1:12:31.886 --> 1:12:32.854
<i>Love you.</i>

1:12:33.221 --> 1:12:34.454
Love you.

1:12:47.367 --> 1:12:48.636
It's been fun.

1:13:48.729 --> 1:13:49.730
Jack!

1:13:50.298 --> 1:13:51.599
Hey, Jack.

1:13:52.465 --> 1:13:54.302
Hey, buddy.

1:13:54.335 --> 1:13:58.906
Hey, buddy.
Let me see that face.
Let me see your face.

1:13:59.974 --> 1:14:01.008
There it is.

1:14:04.345 --> 1:14:05.680
- Hey.
- Hi.

1:14:29.337 --> 1:14:30.571
I'm glad you're back.

1:14:32.773 --> 1:14:33.808
Hmm.

1:14:34.508 --> 1:14:35.943
I love you.

1:14:35.977 --> 1:14:37.011
Love you, too.

1:14:54.195 --> 1:14:57.832
Doctors are happier
with the way the treatments
are going now. So...

1:15:00.001 --> 1:15:02.269
I'm sorry I put you
through all this hell.

1:15:17.551 --> 1:15:20.287
Jimmy,
I know you're in there.

1:15:22.456 --> 1:15:24.291
You better take care of that.

1:15:24.325 --> 1:15:25.993
Jimmy!

1:15:26.027 --> 1:15:28.429
-Yeah, I'm just gonna...
-Just deal with it.

1:15:28.462 --> 1:15:30.698
Okay?

1:15:37.171 --> 1:15:38.205
Hi.

1:15:39.807 --> 1:15:42.376
-What are you doing here?
-You're hurting me.

1:15:42.410 --> 1:15:43.778
They're home.

1:15:44.378 --> 1:15:45.613
What?

1:15:46.647 --> 1:15:49.116
Stop it. All right?

1:15:49.150 --> 1:15:50.384
You need to go home.

1:15:50.418 --> 1:15:52.787
-Just wanna have
a little bit of fun.
-You need to go home.

1:15:59.160 --> 1:16:00.227
They're home.

1:16:02.663 --> 1:16:05.933
Yeah. So Charlie go home.

1:16:09.603 --> 1:16:12.206
Yeah, Charlie go home.

1:16:32.626 --> 1:16:35.830
-Bee, I don't want us to...
-Whatever that was,
it didn't happen.

1:16:36.664 --> 1:16:38.032
I don't want to
hear about it.

1:16:39.633 --> 1:16:40.868
All right?

1:16:42.603 --> 1:16:43.804
All right.

1:17:23.010 --> 1:17:24.011
Hey, Bee.

1:17:24.044 --> 1:17:25.079
Welcome home.

1:17:26.615 --> 1:17:27.848
You know what time it is?

1:17:28.716 --> 1:17:29.817
Coffee time?

1:17:30.718 --> 1:17:32.153
Can I just borrow Jim
for a bit?

1:17:32.186 --> 1:17:34.188
-I just want to talk to him
for a little bit.
-Yeah. Jim.

1:17:36.591 --> 1:17:38.025
I need to
talk to you, brother.

1:17:38.058 --> 1:17:40.794
Yeah, just let me
get my clothes on.

1:18:16.397 --> 1:18:18.699
-Shit.
-Yeah.

1:18:19.733 --> 1:18:21.402
That's how I found her
this morning.

1:18:22.303 --> 1:18:24.104
Outside the club.

1:18:24.138 --> 1:18:26.440
Motherfuckers even left
the trunk open like that.

1:18:34.114 --> 1:18:36.250
-What are you gonna do?
-What...

1:18:37.451 --> 1:18:41.822
Shit. I don't know.
Came out here
to get your help.

1:18:41.855 --> 1:18:43.991
I ain't never done
shit like this before.

1:18:45.527 --> 1:18:47.194
The fuck am I gonna do?

1:18:47.995 --> 1:18:49.964
Oh, fuck.

1:18:53.467 --> 1:18:55.169
There's someone in that truck.

1:18:55.869 --> 1:18:58.573
Don't look. Don't look.

1:18:58.607 --> 1:18:59.807
Oh, shit.

1:19:01.809 --> 1:19:06.213
Fuck, Jim. What the fuck
we gonna do now?

1:19:08.115 --> 1:19:09.049
Oh.

1:19:18.425 --> 1:19:21.161
You're gonna get in that car
and you're gonna get rid of her.

1:19:23.063 --> 1:19:25.466
We need to make it seem
like none of this happened.

1:19:28.369 --> 1:19:29.403
What about you?

1:19:30.437 --> 1:19:33.575
I'm going to go to work,
do what I usually do.

1:19:33.608 --> 1:19:36.477
I'm going to get
my coffee and my eggs,
and I'm gonna head to Houston.

1:19:37.579 --> 1:19:38.445
You...

1:19:42.182 --> 1:19:44.385
-Oh, well, you better...
-Just get in the car.

1:19:47.788 --> 1:19:49.023
Come on.

1:19:49.356 --> 1:19:50.391
All right.

1:19:52.026 --> 1:19:53.360
All right, big brother.

1:20:47.682 --> 1:20:49.450
I need you to get up
and get dressed.

1:20:50.884 --> 1:20:52.821
What's going on?

1:20:52.853 --> 1:20:54.955
I need you to get up
and get dressed.

1:20:56.223 --> 1:20:59.093
-Jim.
-Come on. Get up now.

1:21:06.534 --> 1:21:07.501
Jack?

1:21:09.403 --> 1:21:10.404
Jack?

1:21:10.437 --> 1:21:12.973
Hey, buddy. I need you
to get up, okay?

1:21:13.006 --> 1:21:14.609
I need you to get up
and get dressed.

1:21:16.377 --> 1:21:17.411
Get dressed.

1:21:24.652 --> 1:21:26.186
What is going on?

1:21:26.220 --> 1:21:28.790
Just listen to me.
This is very serious, okay?

1:21:28.823 --> 1:21:30.825
You need to
get out of here now.

1:21:30.859 --> 1:21:32.326
I want you to take
the back road

1:21:32.359 --> 1:21:34.161
-to the parking garage...
-Okay.

1:21:34.194 --> 1:21:36.664
...where we hung out
when we first met.

1:21:36.698 --> 1:21:37.898
-You remember?
-Yes.

1:21:37.931 --> 1:21:40.134
Okay. Mom's car is
parked on the third floor.

1:21:40.167 --> 1:21:41.402
-You got it?
-Okay.

1:21:41.435 --> 1:21:42.503
-You got it?
-Yes.

1:21:43.504 --> 1:21:44.506
Shit.

1:21:46.373 --> 1:21:48.008
Jack...

1:21:48.041 --> 1:21:52.146
Okay. Stan's bike
is right out back, okay?

1:21:52.179 --> 1:21:54.616
I want you to ride it
to that parking garage

1:21:54.649 --> 1:21:58.252
on Second Street,
it's across the river.
You know where it's at?

1:21:58.285 --> 1:21:59.821
-Yes.
-This is very important.

1:21:59.854 --> 1:22:02.189
I need you to go
through the park.

1:22:02.222 --> 1:22:04.925
Okay? You're strong enough?

1:22:04.958 --> 1:22:06.160
-Yes.
-Okay.

1:22:07.261 --> 1:22:09.496
There's cash under
the mat in the car.

1:22:09.531 --> 1:22:12.700
Okay? Both sides.
And don't use credit cards.
You gotta use cash.

1:22:12.734 --> 1:22:15.436
There's money
in a PayPal account
under your name.

1:22:15.469 --> 1:22:17.971
It's written on a note
under one of the mats
in the car.

1:22:18.005 --> 1:22:19.707
-Okay.
-It's written on a note

1:22:19.741 --> 1:22:21.876
-under one of the mats
in the car on the left side.
-All right, I got it.

1:22:21.910 --> 1:22:23.243
-Okay?
-Okay.

1:22:23.277 --> 1:22:26.180
When you get that,
you gotta switch accounts.
Okay?

1:22:26.748 --> 1:22:27.948
Open that drawer.

1:22:27.981 --> 1:22:30.552
-But...
-The passports
are in that drawer.

1:22:34.656 --> 1:22:35.623
Shit!

1:22:36.791 --> 1:22:38.593
You gotta go to Canada,
okay?

1:22:39.293 --> 1:22:40.929
What?

1:22:40.961 --> 1:22:43.565
When you get there,
you tell the police you need
protection from the drug lords.

1:22:45.432 --> 1:22:48.368
It's all on me.
You tell them that, okay?

1:22:48.402 --> 1:22:51.773
Tell the police
to contact the hospital
about his treatment.

1:22:51.806 --> 1:22:53.073
Okay, okay.

1:22:53.608 --> 1:22:54.642
Come here.

1:23:02.249 --> 1:23:04.485
- You gotta put these on.
- It's okay.

1:23:04.519 --> 1:23:06.921
-Okay, it's okay.
-Here, put them on.

1:23:06.955 --> 1:23:07.922
-Okay?
-Here.

1:23:07.956 --> 1:23:10.257
There. Listen to Mama.

1:23:10.290 --> 1:23:13.060
All right. You gotta
take the red bike.

1:23:13.093 --> 1:23:15.028
You, go through the park.

1:23:15.062 --> 1:23:17.632
Okay? Go in
opposite directions.

1:23:17.665 --> 1:23:18.833
You understand that?

1:23:18.867 --> 1:23:19.834
-Yes.
-You understand that?

1:23:19.868 --> 1:23:20.869
-Yes.
-Okay.

1:23:20.902 --> 1:23:22.369
Okay.

1:23:22.402 --> 1:23:25.372
-Come here.
-What about you?

1:23:26.541 --> 1:23:29.544
I'm gonna be all right.
I'm going to be safe, okay?

1:23:38.987 --> 1:23:40.220
Okay.

1:23:40.855 --> 1:23:43.190
Listen. Listen to me, okay?

1:23:46.861 --> 1:23:48.630
You guys are
gonna go out first.

1:23:49.329 --> 1:23:50.665
And then
I'm gonna go out.

1:23:50.698 --> 1:23:52.232
-Okay.
-Okay?

1:23:52.266 --> 1:23:54.067
-You be safe.
-Yes.

1:23:54.101 --> 1:23:55.335
-Okay? All right.
-Okay.

1:23:55.369 --> 1:23:57.906
-Yeah.
-Through the park.
All right, let's go.

1:23:57.939 --> 1:23:59.039
-Okay.
-Let's go.

1:23:59.072 --> 1:24:00.374
Come on, sweetheart.

1:24:00.942 --> 1:24:02.175
I've got you.

1:25:20.420 --> 1:25:22.122
Hello.

1:25:23.625 --> 1:25:26.226
- Hey.
- Can I get you something?

1:25:26.259 --> 1:25:27.729
-Yeah. Please, thank you.
-Coffee?

1:25:42.142 --> 1:25:43.377
Okay.

1:25:43.410 --> 1:25:45.278
-Thank you.
Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

1:25:45.312 --> 1:25:46.914
-Appreciate it.
-Chorizo?

1:25:47.915 --> 1:25:49.182
Please.

1:26:40.168 --> 1:26:41.903
Can I have a strong coffee?

1:26:42.904 --> 1:26:43.905
Black.

1:26:45.205 --> 1:26:46.406
<i>Gracias.</i>

1:27:08.462 --> 1:27:10.798
Black coffee.
Anything else, sir?

1:27:10.832 --> 1:27:12.066
<i>Gracias.</i>

1:27:12.100 --> 1:27:13.768
Anything else?

1:27:24.344 --> 1:27:25.646
How is your coffee?

1:27:30.350 --> 1:27:31.719
I'm sorry. What's that?

1:27:31.753 --> 1:27:32.954
Your coffee.

1:27:34.956 --> 1:27:35.990
How is it?

1:27:38.826 --> 1:27:39.861
It's just fine.

1:27:42.295 --> 1:27:43.664
Mine's a little thin.

1:27:45.365 --> 1:27:47.568
Can I taste yours,
if you don't mind?

1:27:50.270 --> 1:27:52.106
It's probably
the same coffee.

1:27:52.140 --> 1:27:55.610
Maybe yours is stronger?

1:28:16.898 --> 1:28:19.332
Same pot. Too thin.

1:28:20.968 --> 1:28:22.737
Taste is individual,
I guess.

1:28:23.303 --> 1:28:24.939
Yeah?

1:28:24.972 --> 1:28:28.576
I don't know. I asked her
for a strong coffee,
and she brings me this.

1:28:30.178 --> 1:28:31.512
What does that make her?

1:28:33.346 --> 1:28:35.516
She probably prefers it
on the thin side.

1:28:35.550 --> 1:28:38.152
But I asked her
for something else.

1:28:38.186 --> 1:28:41.956
From my standpoint,
that makes her either
a liar, or stupid.

1:28:42.824 --> 1:28:43.858
Am I right?

1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:47.829
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

1:28:47.862 --> 1:28:49.496
I'm a businessman.

1:28:50.965 --> 1:28:53.601
So when I ask
for a strong cup of coffee

1:28:53.634 --> 1:28:56.871
and they bring me
this <i>mierda,</i> this shit...

1:28:56.904 --> 1:28:58.405
it's bad for business...

1:28:59.173 --> 1:29:00.473
and I don't like it.

1:29:01.275 --> 1:29:02.510
Okay.

1:29:03.177 --> 1:29:04.612
Do you know who I am?

1:29:12.186 --> 1:29:13.821
How do you trust a liar?

1:29:15.690 --> 1:29:17.792
I can see the white man
in your eyes...

1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:20.528
looking for a solution.

1:29:21.929 --> 1:29:26.868
White men are always thinking,
always... looking for more,

1:29:26.901 --> 1:29:28.836
always wanting more.

1:29:30.538 --> 1:29:32.506
It's difficult
to be their friend.

1:29:36.878 --> 1:29:40.147
White men are like birds,
long necks,

1:29:40.181 --> 1:29:43.416
always staring,
figuring things out.

1:29:44.619 --> 1:29:46.854
We Mexicans are like dogs.

1:29:48.222 --> 1:29:50.992
We bark, fight, fuck.

1:29:55.663 --> 1:29:57.430
And we love our family.

1:29:59.867 --> 1:30:00.902
Am I right?

1:30:05.573 --> 1:30:08.542
I'm not an animal.
I'm just...

1:30:10.111 --> 1:30:11.512
I'm just a father.

1:30:13.147 --> 1:30:14.181
<i>Bueno.</i>

1:30:15.750 --> 1:30:16.984
I like to...

1:30:19.086 --> 1:30:20.721
get everything my way,

1:30:21.522 --> 1:30:23.291
one way or the other.

1:30:23.324 --> 1:30:25.693
Okay? I don't like losses.

1:30:27.094 --> 1:30:28.095
So...

1:30:29.130 --> 1:30:31.933
we have to find a solution,

1:30:32.900 --> 1:30:34.835
so you can
pay back your debt.

1:30:36.771 --> 1:30:37.939
I get that.

1:30:39.874 --> 1:30:40.942
<i>Bueno.</i>

1:30:42.777 --> 1:30:44.912
There are two kinds of debt.

1:30:44.946 --> 1:30:48.448
There is the moral debt
of the liar.

1:30:50.284 --> 1:30:53.788
It would be bad for morale
if I were to let you
just walk away.

1:30:53.821 --> 1:30:57.425
Wouldn't you say,
or do you think that
is just a matter of taste?

1:30:57.457 --> 1:30:59.727
Weak. Strong.

1:31:04.332 --> 1:31:05.599
No, I don't.

1:31:09.704 --> 1:31:12.006
You must love your son
very much.

1:32:24.578 --> 1:32:25.813
Hello, Jim.

1:32:27.481 --> 1:32:29.917
So here's the thing.
Your truck is loaded.

1:32:29.950 --> 1:32:34.021
When you get to the border,
they know your truck
is loaded. Okay?

1:32:35.156 --> 1:32:38.092
-All right.
-What do you do
when they catch you?

1:32:40.428 --> 1:32:42.663
-Nothing.
-I'm right behind you.

1:32:43.197 --> 1:32:45.266
You wait for me.

1:32:45.299 --> 1:32:48.969
Don't get any ideas.
You do anything,
we come for your family.

1:33:18.432 --> 1:33:20.167
Jack, did anyone follow you?

1:33:20.201 --> 1:33:23.237
-Mom...
-Anyone follow you?
Okay, okay.

1:33:23.270 --> 1:33:26.373
I'm gonna get you in the back.
You lay down, okay?
Cover yourself up, son.

1:33:26.407 --> 1:33:27.908
Okay, okay.

1:33:29.844 --> 1:33:30.911
Okay.

1:34:12.319 --> 1:34:13.354
Stay down.

1:34:37.178 --> 1:34:38.979
What about Dad?

1:34:39.013 --> 1:34:40.848
He's going
to meet us later, okay?

1:35:01.769 --> 1:35:04.238
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, they got me, man.

1:35:04.271 --> 1:35:06.307
-They're gonna pick me up
by the Border Patrol.
<i>-What?</i>

1:35:06.340 --> 1:35:07.642
<i>No, no, no. No.</i>

1:35:07.676 --> 1:35:10.311
<i>If you let them take you,</i>
<i>you're dead.</i>
<i>You understand?</i>

1:35:10.344 --> 1:35:12.479
They're gonna
kill Bee and Jack
if I don't do it.

1:35:12.514 --> 1:35:15.349
<i>No. If they wanted</i>
<i>to kill them,</i>
<i>they'd be dead already.</i>

1:35:15.382 --> 1:35:17.384
<i>It's suicide now.</i>
<i>Border Patrol</i>
<i>is gonna take you,</i>

1:35:17.418 --> 1:35:19.954
<i>and they'll pass by you</i>
<i>with a huge load,</i>
<i>you understand?</i>

1:35:19.987 --> 1:35:21.288
<i>You need to stop right now.</i>

1:35:21.322 --> 1:35:23.057
How the hell am I gonna stop?
He's right behind me.

1:35:23.090 --> 1:35:24.659
<i>Right by the border, brother.</i>

1:35:24.693 --> 1:35:27.194
<i>There's cops all over.</i>
<i>They can't touch you</i>
<i>if you stop there.</i>

1:35:27.228 --> 1:35:29.664
<i>You just slow the fuck down.</i>
<i>I'll catch up</i>
<i>with you, brother.</i>

1:35:29.698 --> 1:35:31.298
<i>I'm in my car.</i>
<i>I'll be there.</i>

1:35:31.332 --> 1:35:32.933
Just stay down, okay?

1:36:03.097 --> 1:36:04.131
Okay.

1:36:22.182 --> 1:36:24.385
Keep that blanket
over you, okay?

1:36:34.028 --> 1:36:35.996
- Where are you, man?
<i>Right here.</i>
<i>I see you now.</i>

1:36:36.030 --> 1:36:38.633
<i>Right here, man.</i>
<i>I see you now.</i>
<i>What truck's he driving?</i>

1:36:38.667 --> 1:36:40.501
It's a Kenworth 0-13.

1:36:40.535 --> 1:36:43.571
-It's black.
<i>-All right. Get ready,</i>
<i>pull on over.</i>

1:36:43.605 --> 1:36:45.372
<i>Just... come on,</i>
<i>pull on over.</i>

1:37:48.936 --> 1:37:50.404
Here he comes.

1:37:50.437 --> 1:37:51.338
Come here.

1:38:04.985 --> 1:38:06.987
Can't stay here.
You need to keep moving.

1:38:22.503 --> 1:38:24.304
You guys can't park here.
You need to keep moving.

1:38:24.338 --> 1:38:26.541
Yeah. I know,
it just broke down, man.

1:38:26.574 --> 1:38:28.041
When are you gonna fix it?
You gotta keep moving.

1:38:28.075 --> 1:38:29.844
I'm going to call them
right now.

1:38:29.878 --> 1:38:31.011
But there's no pitstop.
Who you gonna call?

1:38:31.044 --> 1:38:33.247
I'll be out of here
in ten minutes, man.

1:39:20.027 --> 1:39:22.496
Jack, you can
get up now.

1:39:28.101 --> 1:39:30.404
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hold on.

1:39:30.437 --> 1:39:31.472
Get back down.

1:41:05.265 --> 1:41:07.334
Can you step out
of the vehicle, sir?

1:41:07.367 --> 1:41:10.470
Why was that, Officer?
I didn't do anything wrong.

1:41:10.504 --> 1:41:13.206
-Get the fuck off the vehicle.
-Hold on. Come on, man.

1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:14.174
-Come here. What're you doing?
-Hurry up!

1:41:14.207 --> 1:41:15.643
Hey, fuck, man.

1:41:16.778 --> 1:41:17.812
Fuck!

1:43:08.056 --> 1:43:09.289
Ah, shit, man.

1:43:12.392 --> 1:43:13.628
Shit, you all right?

1:43:14.629 --> 1:43:18.099
Hey, hold up, hey!
What, are you just...

1:43:18.132 --> 1:43:19.567
gonna leave us
out here like this?

1:43:32.847 --> 1:43:33.981
All right, come here.

1:43:35.415 --> 1:43:36.651
Get over here, bud.

1:43:37.752 --> 1:43:38.920
Back up a little bit.

1:43:44.192 --> 1:43:46.894
Gosh... Yeah. All right.

1:43:49.130 --> 1:43:50.397
Get mine...

1:43:52.466 --> 1:43:54.468
Ah, damn them
motherfuckers!

1:44:20.128 --> 1:44:21.361
Well...

1:44:24.899 --> 1:44:26.534
what now, brother?

1:44:27.034 --> 1:44:28.035
Huh?

1:44:33.541 --> 1:44:34.976
Shit, you got a cigarette?

1:44:37.879 --> 1:44:38.913
I got a lighter.

1:44:41.115 --> 1:44:42.917
Oh, man.

1:44:44.018 --> 1:44:45.418
All right.

1:44:58.633 --> 1:45:00.568
You know
I love you, right?

1:45:00.601 --> 1:45:02.570
You know
I've always loved you?

1:45:08.308 --> 1:45:09.544
Yeah.

1:45:10.377 --> 1:45:11.979
Yeah, I have.

1:45:15.583 --> 1:45:17.785
You've always been
a pain in my ass.

1:45:17.819 --> 1:45:20.955
Yeah, I have.

1:45:24.959 --> 1:45:26.661
Always loved you, too, bro.

1:46:49.442 --> 1:46:51.646
All right, you can get up.
We're okay.
