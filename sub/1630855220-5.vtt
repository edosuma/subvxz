WEBVTT

00:51.200 --> 00:53.760
It's okay, it's okay.
You're gonna be okay, my Sílvinha.

00:53.760 --> 00:56.840
- Zinha.
- The nightmare is over now, my baby.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.360
What is he doing here?

00:58.360 --> 01:00.920
Your father and I, we've been talking.

01:00.920 --> 01:04.000
You're going to stay at his house
for a while, until you recover.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.400
Are you out of your mind?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.600
You're out of control, Sílvia.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.800
You need the help of a man
to straighten you out.

01:11.360 --> 01:12.600
- But--
- Believe me, Zinha.

01:12.600 --> 01:15.200
This is as hard for me as it is for you.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.760
Arruda, please.

01:16.760 --> 01:18.080
It's the truth.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.000
Fuck this.

01:22.640 --> 01:26.120
TURN OF THE TIDE

01:29.880 --> 01:31.360
Incredible pasta <i>alla pompino</i>.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.600
This is better than Coca-Cola.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.720
We'll miss you around here, man.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.360
You're being transferred to Lisbon.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.000
To Lisbon? Why?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.640
You know, the mainlanders
want to ship you back to your country.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.120
Are you sure?

01:47.720 --> 01:48.640
It is, dude.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.400
- Oh, shit. What an exaggeration!
- Why don't you give her yours?

02:04.400 --> 02:06.400
Come on, just give a little bit to Zinha.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.120
Your daughter doesn't
even like my cooking.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.560
Mmm!

02:13.560 --> 02:14.760
Don't even think about it.

02:14.760 --> 02:18.000
As long as you're in this house,
you're not touching this.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.040
Yeah, we don't want those problems here.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.040
Wine is not cocaine.

02:25.160 --> 02:28.120
Zinha, wine is cocaine. Same with beer.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.960
From now on, for you,
everything is cocaine, you get it?

02:30.960 --> 02:32.520
Everything is cocaine.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.680
'Til you understand this,
you'll continue fucking up your life.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.080
Mmm, even your fucking cell phone
is cocaine, honey. You know?

02:53.520 --> 02:55.360
I heard
that you could help me.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.720
That you can get me
out of this shithole.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.920
If you give me the recipe
for the pasta <i>alla pompino.</i>

03:10.560 --> 03:13.200
But that recipe is a secret.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.880
The idea is to trade
one secret for another.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.520
Very well. Desperate times...

03:19.800 --> 03:21.480
call for desperate measures.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.560
How do I get out of here?

03:25.160 --> 03:27.840
Do you see that wall over there?

03:30.040 --> 03:30.920
That one?

03:30.920 --> 03:31.840
Yes.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.840
You just jump over the wall.

03:39.560 --> 03:40.400
Ah.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.360
If you just have to jump,
why are you still here?

03:44.280 --> 03:46.520
It's worse out there than in here.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.560
Bills, obligations,

03:50.160 --> 03:52.640
alarm clocks, paperwork.

03:53.720 --> 03:58.000
Only if I was crazy
would I go back out there.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.480
Hey! That's my girl!

04:04.480 --> 04:06.160
That was very good.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.600
Beautiful Zinha!

04:08.600 --> 04:10.680
A woman must be able
to defend herself, right?

04:10.680 --> 04:11.800
Mm-hmm.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.000
There you are.

04:18.520 --> 04:19.640
I appreciate the gift.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.360
And for remembering my birthday.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.000
You were the only one.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.560
Hey. Hold on.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.240
What's wrong, honey?

04:37.840 --> 04:39.960
Rafael hasn't said anything in days.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.600
And his cell phone is off.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.160
No one in Rabo has seen him.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.200
Zinha, you know
that sometimes that's not a bad thing.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.840
Quite the opposite. You get to know
who your friends really are

04:51.840 --> 04:54.080
when the shit hits the fan.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.800
Rafael isn't my friend, he's my boyfriend.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.320
That boyfriend of yours,
when you ended up in the hospital,

05:00.320 --> 05:03.480
what'd he do? He ran like a rat,
didn't he? What's left for you?

05:03.480 --> 05:05.720
You have your family,
who didn't abandon you.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.920
You have a lot of balls
to talk about abandonment.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.320
There we go!

05:35.080 --> 05:38.680
When the shit hits the fan,
that's when people show their true colors.

05:38.680 --> 05:39.720
Come on.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.960
- May I?
- Of course.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.040
- No one should dine alone.
- Hmm.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.480
You're an optimist, Francisco.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.320
But as they say, if life starts off
with a good breakfast,

05:54.320 --> 05:56.400
it usually means your dinner is miserable.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.120
Let me guess. That's the title
of your, uh, autobiography.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.720
Maybe this will improve your dinner.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.160
The list of people who OD'ed
and went to the hospital.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.360
We have that girl.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.520
- From Rabo de Peixe?
- She's pure Rapexinha.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.480
Sílvia Arruda.
She's Rafael Medeiros's girlfriend.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.240
I thought the white powder
was medication for migraines.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.200
So you really think I believe that story?

06:20.200 --> 06:22.160
I had one hell of a migraine that night.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.680
And who gave you that white powder?

06:24.360 --> 06:27.400
I don't remember.
Everything was pretty chaotic.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.720
Music, the lighting.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.840
There were a lot of people
I didn't know at the concert.

06:31.840 --> 06:34.440
You're saying you accept medication
from people you don't know?

06:34.440 --> 06:36.480
That was before, when I trusted people.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.880
But don't worry. I learned my lesson.

06:42.640 --> 06:43.760
You can leave.

06:45.560 --> 06:48.280
And know that I'm here to talk,
if you recover your memory.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.560
Some things are best forgotten.

07:01.480 --> 07:02.440
Mmm.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.320
Fucking Arruda is allergic to the police,
you know what I'm saying?

07:11.720 --> 07:14.000
He said he would pay
for the cab afterwards.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.200
But he's right about one thing.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.560
It's times like these where you see
who really has your back.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.240
Don't say that.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.200
You'll see.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.600
Any day now,
Rafael will show up, totally hungover,

07:28.600 --> 07:31.560
with his tail between his legs,
apologizing. I promise you, babe.

07:32.760 --> 07:34.360
I'm not talking about Rafael.

07:37.640 --> 07:38.800
I'm talking about Eduardo.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.480
He got us into this mess.

07:44.640 --> 07:47.320
With so many speeches
and so many promises.

07:47.320 --> 07:48.920
And now, he's the first to flee.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.360
Something must've happened.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.760
The Eduardo I know
wouldn't leave us like this.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.440
And besides, I'm not going anywhere.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.120
Muah! It's you and me for life, got it?

08:08.800 --> 08:09.920
Mm-hmm.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.880
Whoo!

08:12.880 --> 08:14.240
And this look, kiddo? Yep.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.320
Hmm!

08:15.320 --> 08:18.120
Neither Rafael nor Eduardo together
can give you this!

08:18.120 --> 08:19.280
Look!

09:06.600 --> 09:07.520
Ah.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.240
And have you, uh-- have you finished?

09:11.240 --> 09:12.800
Of course! Here.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.000
You got the cash?

09:19.840 --> 09:20.880
Here it is.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.680
- All good?
- All good.

09:30.800 --> 09:34.920
Don't forget, you still owe me
the recipe for the pasta <i>alla pompino.</i>

09:34.920 --> 09:37.040
I won't forget,
I won't forget.

09:58.760 --> 09:59.760
Who are they?

10:01.480 --> 10:03.480
The Magnussons.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.480
They're Scandinavians
and they're going to kill Ian.

10:07.160 --> 10:10.240
Okay. And who... is Ian?

10:11.040 --> 10:12.840
Ian is my boyfriend.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.600
He promised them the drugs.
They paid and now the coke's disappeared.

10:19.800 --> 10:20.920
Hey, you!

10:22.840 --> 10:26.640
You pig! You don't understand
anything. I am waiting for you.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.840
Wait, wait, wait.
You're saying your boyfriend sold drugs

10:29.840 --> 10:32.320
to some guys called Magnusson?

10:32.320 --> 10:34.760
You mean like that dude
that played for Benfica?

10:34.760 --> 10:37.080
The little blond.

10:40.680 --> 10:42.920
Bruna, don't worry. Come on.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.840
You can talk freely.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.960
My father knows.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.920
Eduardo and Rafael
were supposed to deliver the drugs.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.000
<i>But they disappeared.</i>

10:56.000 --> 10:58.280
You do not
understand Swedish?

10:58.280 --> 11:00.520
And the drugs they promised
never arrived.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.160
Maybe they ran away
because they didn't deliver it.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.280
<i>And now the Magnussons
went to Ian's house.</i>

11:06.280 --> 11:09.280
No, not that one.
That one has a cool design.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.120
And they threatened to kill him.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.000
They said we have a week
to make the delivery.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.320
Say that you can help us, Dad.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.520
Sorry, honey,
I have nothing to do with this.

11:32.520 --> 11:33.440
But I do.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.480
Bruna is my friend.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.360
She helped me when I needed it.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.440
Ah, Jesus fucking Christ.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.400
Look, I went and got us help.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.360
Help for what?
Who said I needed help, Bruna?

12:08.360 --> 12:09.640
Ah, damn it.

12:09.640 --> 12:12.240
Whoa-ho! Holy shit!

12:13.280 --> 12:16.400
Looks like you had
quite the party.

12:19.120 --> 12:21.400
Hey there, twinkletoes, take a seat.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.320
You're in my house.
Don't talk like that to me.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.680
Are you gonna sit down or...

12:31.680 --> 12:33.320
you want me to break one of your wings?

12:33.320 --> 12:34.760
Sit the fuck down.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.600
Hey, playboy, do you have a dog around?

12:42.600 --> 12:45.520
Yeah, I have a dog. It's just that it went
out to buy rolling papers.

12:45.520 --> 12:46.680
It'll be right back.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.600
What a funny guy.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.680
So let's get down to the nitty-gritty.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.040
How much money
do you owe the Scandinavians?

12:55.040 --> 12:56.600
Sixty thousand.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.280
Sixty thousand what? Escudos?

13:00.200 --> 13:01.120
Are you serious?

13:03.480 --> 13:05.440
I don't sell cough drops, right?

13:07.080 --> 13:09.840
- Sixty thousand euros.
- Sixty's a lot of money.

13:09.840 --> 13:12.240
So how many kilos
did you promise these guys?

13:13.760 --> 13:17.080
Two kilos for 60,000 euros. Fucking A.

13:20.520 --> 13:21.840
Should I blow you, or...?

13:24.040 --> 13:26.040
Let me explain.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.520
These are people I met

13:32.920 --> 13:34.240
when I lived in Copenhagen.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.560
- They are--
- Man, give me a popcorn. Here.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.080
Take one.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.040
Mmm.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.840
Thirty thousand euros for one kilo?

13:54.440 --> 13:55.600
They're businessmen.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.000
Thirty thousand euros per kilo?

14:00.320 --> 14:01.640
And they pay more.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.480
If I want, I can up the price.

14:06.320 --> 14:07.640
They're trustworthy.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.560
Soon as I told them about the cocaine,
they said they wanted it.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.640
And they fucked up your whole house?
Hmm?

14:18.120 --> 14:20.480
One thing is one thing,
another thing is another thing.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.440
Sit down!

14:22.440 --> 14:24.600
What the fuck, man?
Stop it! Damn it!

14:24.600 --> 14:26.920
God, fuck! Fuck! Ow!

14:26.920 --> 14:28.120
Fuck, man!

14:29.440 --> 14:30.880
Fucking son of a bitch.

14:32.880 --> 14:35.840
How many kilos do you think
those dudes can take, roughly?

14:40.920 --> 14:42.680
Do you want me
to repeat the fucking question?

14:43.360 --> 14:44.880
They said they can buy all of it.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.000
Mmm.

14:46.720 --> 14:47.960
This stuff here...

14:49.640 --> 14:52.240
...cash money, motherfuckers.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.800
Get to fucking work.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.200
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you. I have mine.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.320
Let's get the fuck out of here.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.120
Go!

15:51.040 --> 15:51.920
All right, let's go!

16:40.720 --> 16:42.560
Today's the day, playboy.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.440
Out of the way!

16:56.640 --> 16:57.720
Hey!

16:58.800 --> 16:59.920
Go!

17:01.440 --> 17:02.520
Hey!

17:09.000 --> 17:10.120
Go faster!

17:14.160 --> 17:16.640
I don't see the truck.
Where the fuck is he?

17:18.800 --> 17:20.120
Wait, there he is. I see him.

17:23.880 --> 17:27.040
Dollars, motherfuckers.

17:27.840 --> 17:30.000
Dollars, motherfuckers!

17:30.000 --> 17:31.520
Dollars, God damn it!

18:17.360 --> 18:18.960
- Are you ready?
- Let's do this.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.000
Let's go. Come on.

19:09.360 --> 19:12.080
It's flour and sugar!

19:12.080 --> 19:14.040
You tricked us, you motherfucker!

19:14.040 --> 19:16.280
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Calm down!

19:23.160 --> 19:24.040
<i>Magic.</i>

19:24.760 --> 19:27.600
<i>It's not about how. It's when.</i>

19:28.200 --> 19:30.920
<i>While everyone was looking
in the wrong direction,</i>

19:30.920 --> 19:33.360
<i>my boy Eduardo was doing his trick.</i>

19:37.360 --> 19:39.720
Hurry up. You have to leave Rabo de Peixe.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.920
No, Dad, I'm not leaving you here alone.

19:41.920 --> 19:45.360
I'll be fine. That Italian won't rest
until he gets what's his.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.440
Here, you're a dead man. Get your things.

20:02.520 --> 20:03.600
I need your help, all right?

20:04.680 --> 20:08.040
No, no. Seriously.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.160
I see that you've calmed down. Huh?

20:15.560 --> 20:16.880
What a fucking ass.

20:17.440 --> 20:18.760
So that's the plan.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.920
We have to help him.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.920
Ian, you'll get your share.

20:24.920 --> 20:25.920
Uh-huh?

20:27.120 --> 20:29.240
Really? If I get my share,

20:30.280 --> 20:32.200
you can camp on my floor, right there.

20:33.280 --> 20:36.000
You can take a shit with the door open,
whatever you want.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.320
Come here.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.440
I'm not in the mood.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.200
I think you are. Fucking get over here.

21:01.440 --> 21:02.280
Eduardo.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.440
Are you okay?

21:03.440 --> 21:06.240
We don't have much time.
I'm at my dad's place.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.440
Rafael?

21:09.840 --> 21:13.080
I saw Rafael with your dad and Zé
in the trawler.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.040
They took all the drugs.

21:18.520 --> 21:20.000
Don't worry, Sílvia.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.000
I have a plan.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.680
Okay. Understood.

21:29.880 --> 21:30.800
Get some rest.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.160
I gotta go. Ciao.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.680
Just checking in. How's my girl?

21:38.520 --> 21:40.200
One day at a time, right?

21:46.280 --> 21:48.920
Those are the three essential elements
to a heist like this.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.520
Planning,

21:52.680 --> 21:53.640
the execution,

21:54.200 --> 21:55.360
and the most important,

21:56.920 --> 21:57.760
the escape.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.440
Where did you learn all that?

21:59.440 --> 22:01.840
If we all stick to the plan,
we'll recover what's ours.

22:05.960 --> 22:08.800
- Ian, are you out of your mind or what?
- Shh.

22:08.800 --> 22:09.800
Be careful now.

22:14.920 --> 22:16.560
Fake. It's a prop.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.520
If we're gonna do a show...

22:20.080 --> 22:21.560
...we need props, then.

22:21.560 --> 22:22.640
Right, Carlinhos?

22:26.680 --> 22:28.280
Are you sure that it's going to work?

22:28.960 --> 22:30.080
If we follow the plan.

22:30.080 --> 22:31.720
And since it's all thought out...

22:33.080 --> 22:34.280
let's execute, right?

22:59.120 --> 23:00.440
I have something for you.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.400
To play the <i>Snake</i> game.

23:29.480 --> 23:30.320
Zé...

23:31.640 --> 23:34.200
I know you were on the boat
with my father and Rafael.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.440
I need to know what happened to Rafael.

23:44.760 --> 23:46.960
I know you think my father is a good boss.

23:48.600 --> 23:49.920
But that's not kindness.

23:50.440 --> 23:51.400
It's power.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.960
Whatever he does for us,

23:58.360 --> 23:59.720
it's only to control us.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.120
I have no future.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.480
I'll never be a boss like you.

24:16.640 --> 24:18.080
You need to trust me.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.960
I'm not like my father.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.200
It was your father who killed Rafael.

24:39.160 --> 24:40.200
<i>It was him.</i>

24:41.760 --> 24:43.600
It was your father who killed Rafael.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.480
It was in cold blood.

24:54.840 --> 24:56.480
He hadn't done anything!

25:08.720 --> 25:09.960
Zé.

25:12.360 --> 25:13.280
Sílvia?

25:13.280 --> 25:15.120
What if I gave you the opportunity

25:16.440 --> 25:18.480
to get revenge on him once and for all?

25:46.200 --> 25:49.200
Zinha, everything okay?

26:14.880 --> 26:17.800
Eduardo and Rafael
were supposed to deliver the drugs,

26:17.800 --> 26:19.040
but they disappeared.

26:19.040 --> 26:23.000
And now the Magnussons went to Ian's house
and they threatened to kill him.

26:56.680 --> 26:59.720
Jesus fucking Christ. Ugh.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.400
- I went and got us help.
- Help for what?

27:01.400 --> 27:03.120
Who said I needed help, Bruna?

27:04.000 --> 27:06.600
Whoa-ho! Holy shit!

27:06.600 --> 27:09.000
Looks like you had
quite the party.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.480
Hey there, twinkletoes, take a seat.

27:19.920 --> 27:22.240
Hey, playboy,
do you have a dog around?

27:22.240 --> 27:24.400
Yeah, I have a dog.
Just that it went out

27:24.400 --> 27:26.120
to buy rolling papers.
It'll be right back.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.320
Come on, come on.
Keep working, come on.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.880
Mix it up now, come on. Mix it up, hurry.

27:40.600 --> 27:43.040
Let's get this train
to the station on time.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.520
Locked and loaded.

27:44.520 --> 27:46.800
Come on. Keep it coming.

27:47.920 --> 27:51.160
Give it to me. Perfect.
Thank you very much, ladies.

27:51.160 --> 27:52.200
All right.

27:57.800 --> 27:58.640
Whoo!

28:13.200 --> 28:15.200
Yah, yah!

28:40.760 --> 28:41.720
Zé!

28:42.480 --> 28:44.800
Next to the lighthouse,
there's a skiff waiting.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.120
Come on, Zé.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.080
Zé! Thank you.

29:09.840 --> 29:12.320
I don't see the truck.
Where the fuck is he?

29:14.520 --> 29:16.800
Wait, there he is. I see him.

29:18.280 --> 29:20.160
<i>Life is fucking unfair,</i>

29:20.160 --> 29:23.000
<i>and there aren't many fuckers
who get a second chance.</i>

29:23.920 --> 29:25.760
<i>Rafael will never play for Benfica.</i>

29:26.600 --> 29:29.000
<i>Zé will never get to the boat
that would save him.</i>

29:29.680 --> 29:30.720
<i>And the Magnussons</i>

29:30.720 --> 29:33.200
<i>will never have a taste
of the cocaine they bought.</i>

29:33.200 --> 29:35.640
It's flour and sugar!

29:36.640 --> 29:38.640
You tricked us, you motherfucker!

29:39.720 --> 29:40.600
Hey, wait a sec.

29:45.560 --> 29:47.440
Whoa!

29:49.760 --> 29:52.360
Fuck! Holy shit!

29:55.360 --> 29:56.800
You fucking son of a bitch!

30:01.840 --> 30:03.760
- What the fuck's going on?
- We got fucked over.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.000
- What is it, asshole?
- He says it's fucking flour, man!

30:06.000 --> 30:08.280
Eduardo, fucker!

30:17.840 --> 30:18.960
Fucking shit!

30:19.960 --> 30:21.680
Gimme that shit!

30:21.680 --> 30:23.480
- Huh?
- Come on, give it!

30:42.760 --> 30:43.760
Fuck this.

30:57.360 --> 30:59.440
That fucking chicken shit.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.320
Ah, you little bitch.

31:19.960 --> 31:21.600
Ah, you mother--

31:31.320 --> 31:32.760
Where were you fucking going?

31:32.760 --> 31:34.240
- You hear me, you fucking rat?
- Boss!

31:34.240 --> 31:36.640
- Where were you fucking going?
- Boss, I don't know anything!

31:36.640 --> 31:39.440
You got three fucking options.
You either kill me,

31:39.440 --> 31:42.440
or you shoot yourself,
or tell me who fucked me, asshole!

31:42.440 --> 31:43.600
- I swear to you--
- You don't?

31:43.600 --> 31:45.840
Then pull the trigger
and shoot yourself, you coward!

31:45.840 --> 31:46.960
Come on, motherfucker!

31:46.960 --> 31:48.120
Fucking do it!

31:48.120 --> 31:51.080
Shoot me, it doesn't matter.
I'm already dead, so just shoot me.

31:51.080 --> 31:52.920
- Oh, you're already dead, fucker?
- Yeah, I am.

31:52.920 --> 31:55.160
It's better than living
that piece of shit life of yours.

31:55.160 --> 31:56.520
- Who was it?
- Shoot me now!

31:56.520 --> 31:57.920
- Who was it? Who was it?
- Shoot me!

31:57.920 --> 32:00.360
- Who was it, you fucking asshole?
- It was your daughter.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.840
It was Sílvia.

32:05.120 --> 32:07.840
- You're saying it was my Zinha?
- It was Sílvia.

32:07.840 --> 32:10.120
Really?

32:15.960 --> 32:17.520
No!

32:49.960 --> 32:54.040
<i>The universe doesn't judge.
It doesn't give prizes.</i>

32:54.560 --> 32:56.800
<i>It is pure indifference and chance.</i>

32:57.320 --> 33:00.040
<i>So if you get lucky
and get a second chance,</i>

33:00.960 --> 33:03.440
<i>fuck me if you don't take it
for all it's worth.</i>

33:05.080 --> 33:06.440
- You got it?
- Yeah.

33:33.520 --> 33:35.040
We're only missing Rafael.

34:26.520 --> 34:29.360
Where are we going, hmm?

34:31.080 --> 34:34.800
- We're going where no one will find us.
- And we'll get there in this beater?

34:38.320 --> 34:39.520
I think so.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.240
It's time to go. Come on.

35:29.360 --> 35:32.840
Oh, remember.
Fresh water, good wine, a tight pussy--

35:32.840 --> 35:34.040
A hard dick.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.680
The Italian paid
for your annual subscription.

36:51.680 --> 36:53.440
And the recipe?

36:56.800 --> 36:57.680
Thanks.

37:04.720 --> 37:07.200
RECIPE FOR BLOWJOB PASTA

37:16.440 --> 37:18.320
Come on!

37:18.320 --> 37:19.880
You have to put the helmet on first.

37:19.880 --> 37:21.120
Are you serious?

37:21.120 --> 37:22.960
Put that on so we can leave. Let's go.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.520
Start the bike. Go!

37:24.520 --> 37:27.120
Start the fucking bike.
Let's go!

38:09.680 --> 38:10.560
Fuck me.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.560
Uncle Joe.

38:22.600 --> 38:23.560
Hey, kid.
