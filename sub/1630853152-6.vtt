00:15.015 --> 00:16.517
What is it?

00:16.600 --> 00:18.477
Diana Taverner is downstairs.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.689
Tell her I'll be down in five minutes.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.651
She says to come straight down.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.862
-What's going on, darling?
-Nothing, darling.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.143
I wonder what the others are up to.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.192
Could have called them if you hadn't
thrown away Min and Louisa's phones.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.238
Should let them know
they're not being hunted anymore,

01:11.321 --> 01:16.201
in case they're halfway through
some dodgy backstreet plastic surgery.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.094
Can't hack the satnav.

02:16.178 --> 02:19.139
-Because?
-Cheap bastards didn't hire one.

02:19.223 --> 02:21.308
Or the flash bastards had their own.

02:21.391 --> 02:25.771
What I have done,
and which is beneath you puny mortals,

02:26.396 --> 02:28.482
is hack into
the van's Theft Recovery Transmitter.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.858
So we can track it?

02:30.484 --> 02:32.861
Signal's intermittent,
so you'll only get where the vehicle is

02:32.945 --> 02:34.071
or was every ten minutes.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.281
But they're heading east on the A12.

02:36.365 --> 02:39.618
Last ping from a petrol station
just outside Chelmsford.

02:40.244 --> 02:42.829
-What? So what do we do with this?
-Well, we call it in.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.749
To the Park? When they're trying to hang
the kidnap on us?

02:46.583 --> 02:48.085
Then we get it to someone else.

02:59.263 --> 03:01.682
Diana. I'm afraid our maid is asleep,

03:01.765 --> 03:04.142
so it's me on char duty.
What can I get you?

03:04.226 --> 03:06.895
Tea, please. Assam if you have it,
builder's otherwise.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.438
Milk, no sugar.

03:08.981 --> 03:11.733
-So, you know why I'm here?
-I've no idea why you're here.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.735
I think you do.
Otherwise, you'd have asked.

03:13.819 --> 03:17.489
I've a woman in my kitchen I've met
a few times on the cocktail party circuit.

03:17.573 --> 03:20.742
I'm more concerned with how I'm going
to explain your presence to my wife.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.703
I can give her a prÃ©cis if you like.

03:22.786 --> 03:25.539
We know from phone records
that Robert Hobden called you

03:25.622 --> 03:27.291
yesterday afternoon, repeatedly.

03:27.791 --> 03:30.043
None of the calls lasted
more than 15 seconds

03:30.127 --> 03:32.296
so clearly he couldn't get through.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.048
Now, I could pull CCTV
from surrounding streets

03:35.132 --> 03:37.968
to confirm what I already know
but don't have the time to prove,

03:38.051 --> 03:42.389
which is that Hobden eventually turned up
here, desperate to talk to you.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.310
Would you believe it?
After all that, no Assam.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.394
Have to be builder's.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.939
By the way, what's his name, Hobden?

03:51.481 --> 03:52.691
Haven't seen him for years.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.359
Doubt I'd recognize him if I did.

03:54.443 --> 03:58.155
Another thing I know but don't have
the time to prove at this exact moment

03:58.238 --> 04:00.866
is that after Hobden's visit,
calls were made,

04:00.949 --> 04:02.868
by you or someone close to you,

04:02.951 --> 04:07.956
to certain individuals with links
to the people who kidnapped Hassan Ahmed.

04:08.957 --> 04:12.920
Again, I could pull up the phone records
for everyone in this building,

04:13.003 --> 04:15.005
starting with the man
listening at the door.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.134
And, of course, your phone records.

04:19.218 --> 04:22.846
I'm guessing there might be some numbers
you don't want your wife to know about.

04:23.347 --> 04:27.017
Those to the mothers of the children
she's not aware of, perhaps?

04:28.352 --> 04:31.355
-I have a very open marriage.
-I don't give a fuck about your marriage!

04:31.438 --> 04:34.983
I have a dead agent at the scene of a
kidnapping and a boy who's God knows where

04:35.067 --> 04:37.861
who'll be next to die,
all because of a phone call you made.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.948
I wish I could help you, Diana,
but I made no such call.

04:43.492 --> 04:46.411
I'm gonna turn on the kettle
for the tea you've failed to make.

04:46.495 --> 04:49.122
If you're not talking straight with me
by the time it boils,

04:49.206 --> 04:50.582
I'm going to call in the Dogs

04:50.666 --> 04:53.085
and begin the process
of turning your life inside out.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.755
Okay, thank you.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.105
Judging by the tone of the woman
who answered the phone,

05:13.188 --> 05:15.816
this was likely the 1,000th tip
they received today.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.818
Well, surely it made
a difference coming from you.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.486
Well, who was I to say was calling?

05:20.028 --> 05:21.029
"Hello, Scotland Yard?

05:21.113 --> 05:24.157
I'm with the punishment detail at MI5,
although at present,

05:24.241 --> 05:27.870
they're hunting me for the kidnapping
that I'm trying to help you solve."

05:37.004 --> 05:38.130
I'm going.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.257
-Where?
-Down the A12.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.926
-You'll never catch them.
-I might if I put my foot down.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.469
Pigs'll pull you over for speeding.

05:44.553 --> 05:45.721
How many times, we're the pigs.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.347
I won't stop.
I'll lead them to the kidnappers.

05:47.431 --> 05:49.057
Hey. Hold on. I'll come with you.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.769
Roddy and I will go to Lamb's flat,
in case he shows.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.188
Lamb's not at his flat.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.522
And how do you know that?

05:55.606 --> 05:59.151
I put a tracker on his car a year ago.
I put one on all of your cars.

06:01.778 --> 06:05.324
What? I did it precisely
for a situation like this.

06:16.543 --> 06:20.172
This isn't about whether or not
Hobden was here or if I made a call.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.216
You're on the clock
and need me to do something,

06:22.299 --> 06:23.926
so why don't you just come out and ask?

06:24.009 --> 06:25.385
I want you to use your contacts

06:25.469 --> 06:28.180
in the far right to connect with
the head of the Sons of Albion.

06:28.263 --> 06:31.141
Find out where his boys might go
if they wanted to leave the country.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.559
I don't know Simmonds.

06:32.643 --> 06:34.394
You went grouse shooting
with him last year.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.230
There were a lot of people on that shoot.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.815
Just the two of you golfing
at Sunningdale, though.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.486
My sources say he thrashed you,
which is probably why you blanked it.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.363
Why should he do me any favors?

06:44.446 --> 06:46.490
Tell him I don't have time
to kick his door in,

06:46.573 --> 06:48.283
but I will if he leaves me no option.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.077
He gives them up within five minutes,

06:50.160 --> 06:52.496
or the pair of you are having breakfast
in a holding cell.

06:53.539 --> 06:55.916
I know about the Frontline Club, Diana.

06:55.999 --> 06:59.878
And what Hobden overheard you say
to your brother, was it?

06:59.962 --> 07:03.590
Your one card. Are you sure
you want to play that now?

07:03.674 --> 07:06.176
Now is the only time to play it.
Game'll be over soon.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.761
Then go and get dressed.

07:08.887 --> 07:11.598
I'll take the hit when it comes,
but you are going to the Park.

07:11.682 --> 07:15.185
Down to a floor with no number.
I'd wear something comfortable.

07:15.269 --> 07:18.063
Something you don't mind ruining
with piss, shit and blood.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.316
Now, now, Diana, I'm not suggesting
mutually assured destruction.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.651
What are you suggesting?

07:23.318 --> 07:24.778
You and I share the same problem.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.657
Connection to the unsavories
through one man.

07:29.283 --> 07:30.325
Robert Hobden.

07:33.996 --> 07:36.707
I hope you don't mind if I listen in
when you make your calls.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.024
How the fuck did you find us?

08:06.278 --> 08:09.031
Well, put it back.
It'll come in handy if it gets nicked.

08:09.114 --> 08:12.743
They haven't cuffed us.
You must have the photographs.

08:12.826 --> 08:16.079
-Yeah. We checkmated Taverner.
-Were you planning on telling us?

08:16.163 --> 08:18.290
No, I was enjoying not seeing you.

08:18.373 --> 08:19.541
Where are Min and Louisa?

08:19.625 --> 08:22.169
Well, Ho worked out a way
to track the kidnappers.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.046
Min and Louisa are chasing after them.

08:24.129 --> 08:27.799
My orders were pretty clear. Do fuck all!

08:27.883 --> 08:30.594
You've let two Slow Horses tear off
in a doomed attempt

08:30.677 --> 08:32.304
to try and not make things worse.

08:32.386 --> 08:35.015
I didn't let them.
Jackson, they're autonomous beings.

08:35.097 --> 08:38.559
I just hope they only get themselves
killed and don't set an orphanage on fire.

08:39.645 --> 08:43.065
Keep tracking that van.
Let me know if it so much as changes lane.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.693
Think they're headed here.

08:48.237 --> 08:50.989
This is Duffy.
Get a tactical team airborne. Now.

08:53.784 --> 08:55.202
They're headed to Harwich.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.537
How did you know?

08:56.620 --> 09:01.750
Black used an old legend to hire a van.
Ho accessed the van's theft locator.

09:01.834 --> 09:05.212
They're on the A12.
Nearest port is Harwich.

09:05.295 --> 09:09.216
Standish and Ho will give you
all the various. I'm off for a kip.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.682
You're not actually
gonna go to bed, are you?

09:17.891 --> 09:19.226
You have something for us?

09:20.352 --> 09:23.021
That's the van's plate number
and the ID for the theft locator.

09:23.105 --> 09:25.065
They're going after the kidnappers,
aren't they?

09:25.148 --> 09:26.984
God, men are such boys.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.903
Ma'am, while I appreciate you
offering to include me

09:29.987 --> 09:32.489
in your circle of sisterhood,
I'll have to decline.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.033
Unless you want to fulfill
the promise you made

09:35.117 --> 09:37.411
and tell me what you know
about Partner's death?

09:37.494 --> 09:40.038
That ship sailed, Standish,
when you pulled a gun

09:40.122 --> 09:41.206
on one of my Dogs.

09:41.290 --> 09:45.919
Just think, if you'd returned my call,
you'd be back at the Park tomorrow.

09:46.003 --> 09:48.005
And why on earth would I want that?

09:49.882 --> 09:51.049
-Roddy.
-What?

09:51.633 --> 09:53.510
-Shut up and keep walking.
-Where?

09:53.594 --> 09:55.095
-Slough House.
-No, but that's--

09:55.179 --> 09:58.473
I know it's the other way, Roddy,
but I was in dire need of a dramatic exit.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.351
Do not look back.
That's just what she wants.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.622
They stopped for petrol,
headed east 20 minutes ago.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.540
-Sure it was them?
-Yeah, they made Hassan get it.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.791
Hassan? Why make him--

10:24.875 --> 10:26.919
The guy remembered him
because he left a tip.

10:27.002 --> 10:28.462
Did you not get any food?

10:28.545 --> 10:30.088
You can see I didn't. Let's go, Min.

10:30.172 --> 10:31.882
Do you mind if I nip in and get something?

10:31.965 --> 10:34.510
Yeah, sure. Only if you don't mind
admitting at Hassan's inquest

10:34.593 --> 10:36.386
that we arrived late
because you needed crisps.

10:36.470 --> 10:37.471
Okay, okay.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.099
Jesus Christ, Min. Hurry up!

10:41.183 --> 10:45.145
All right! I just function better
on a bit of food, that's all.

10:45.229 --> 10:46.396
For God's sake.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.284
I was seven, maybe eight.

10:59.368 --> 11:02.663
It was the first castle I saw up close.
All in ruins.

11:02.746 --> 11:07.918
You could play around it, climb on it.
My granddad said it was Norman.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.337
Very old.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.257
As England as England could be.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.386
Be a good spot for it.

11:17.469 --> 11:20.889
-Can we just go to the boat?
-How's your memory?

11:21.390 --> 11:22.391
Fine. What?

11:22.474 --> 11:24.935
'Cause you seem to be forgetting
what happened to the last person

11:25.018 --> 11:27.354
who asked,
"Can we not just go to the boat?"

11:27.437 --> 11:29.815
No, I mean we'll kill him, yeah?
We'll kill him!

11:29.898 --> 11:33.110
All right? But at the harbor
or the boat or something--

11:33.193 --> 11:34.194
Are you sure about that?

11:34.278 --> 11:37.656
Because it's pretty tricky swinging an axe
on a boat. I might miss. I might hit you.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.617
-Mate, time is running out--
-So is my fucking patience!

11:40.701 --> 11:41.994
Fucking hell!

11:42.077 --> 11:44.913
He won't shoot you at the wheel.
We'd crash, we might all die.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.043
Well, you're not at the wheel, are you?
What's to stop me shooting you?

11:51.211 --> 11:53.172
Because you want to chop my head off.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.632
You want me on my knees, remember?

11:57.676 --> 11:58.760
Not long now.

12:04.558 --> 12:05.976
Van's 20 miles ahead of you.

12:06.727 --> 12:07.936
Min and Louisa?

12:08.562 --> 12:09.605
Ten miles.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.481
Are you into the Park's feed?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.734
Was nearly there when you called.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.570
-Then stop talking!
-Well, no, wait, wait, Roddy.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.114
When you get a sec,
can you get into the hospital's system

12:19.198 --> 12:20.657
and find out how Sid is? And--

12:22.284 --> 12:23.285
What the fuck?

12:25.329 --> 12:29.499
You need to hear this from me,
not an insensitive prick like him.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.337
What, she's gone?

12:36.840 --> 12:37.841
Yeah.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.852
Count yourself lucky.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.271
Jesus Chri--

12:52.397 --> 12:54.691
Yeah, lucky me. Yeah.

12:54.775 --> 12:58.195
From my end of the telescope,
surviving's the short straw.

13:02.157 --> 13:07.037
By the time I was your age,
I'd lost a baker's dozen.

13:10.332 --> 13:11.917
It was bad enough when the Wall was up,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.087
but once they reduced it to bricks
and rubble, everything went to shit.

13:16.213 --> 13:19.716
Whole networks of joes rounded up, blown.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.803
I haven't forgotten any of them.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.558
And I won't forget Sid.

13:32.521 --> 13:36.984
-Besides, she was the only one of you--
-Who wasn't complete shit.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.777
Yeah, yeah. You-- You've said that.

13:43.866 --> 13:47.244
Any rate, the moral of the story is,
get used to death.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.373
Cause you're gonna see a lot more of it.

13:51.456 --> 13:54.501
And if that scares you,
then open the door and roll out now.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.112
Out. Get the f--

14:25.532 --> 14:26.658
Get our friend out.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.457
Get rid of him.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.292
In there. And you're helping.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.044
You get his legs. Go on.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.527
Once he's killed me, he's gonna
wanna go out in a blaze of glory.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.112
If you're with him,

15:04.196 --> 15:05.989
-you'll get killed in the cross fire.
-Shut up!

15:06.073 --> 15:09.243
All right. Tie his hands and feet.
Make sure he can't run.

15:13.664 --> 15:16.667
-Help me escape. Please.
-Shut the fuck up!

15:16.750 --> 15:18.210
The fuck's going on in there?

15:20.629 --> 15:22.631
You didn't know. You didn't know.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.140
All right, get up. Here.

15:33.267 --> 15:35.811
Fucking-- Go on. Go on.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.961
What the hell, Min?

16:01.044 --> 16:02.546
Well, I've run out of petrol.

16:03.297 --> 16:04.798
Are you fucking kidding?

16:05.465 --> 16:08.177
How can we be out of petrol?
We were just at a petrol station.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.470
Well, hang on. We were--
We weren't stopping for petrol.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.472
Yeah, I know.
Otherwise you'd have got fucking petrol!

16:12.556 --> 16:13.640
We were stopping for intel.

16:13.724 --> 16:16.602
I got the intel! What were you doing
whilst I was doing that?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.521
I-- I was distracted.
I was thinking about stuff.

16:19.605 --> 16:20.689
What stuff?

16:20.772 --> 16:22.274
I don't know. Nothing.

16:22.357 --> 16:23.901
No, no one thinks about nothing, Min,

16:23.984 --> 16:26.028
unless they're a Zen master.
Are you a Zen master?

16:26.111 --> 16:28.739
No, I'm not! No, I'm tired.
I was thinking about sleeping.

16:28.822 --> 16:29.823
Food, you know.

16:30.324 --> 16:32.117
-Fuck.
-Oh, my God.

16:32.826 --> 16:33.827
What?

16:33.911 --> 16:35.245
You were thinking about sex.

16:37.206 --> 16:38.207
No.

16:38.290 --> 16:40.292
Yes, you were.
Specifically about shagging me.

16:41.126 --> 16:42.127
No.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.922
Jesus fucking Christ!

16:50.469 --> 16:52.054
No! Fucking stand over there!

16:55.182 --> 16:56.141
Over there!

16:57.142 --> 16:58.352
Nowhere fucking near me.

16:59.228 --> 17:00.395
-Here?
-Yeah.

17:09.530 --> 17:10.531
You've got an axe.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.116
Yeah, and he's got a gun.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.993
-Please. Please.
-Quiet.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.997
-You know we're both dead.
-Stay on the paths!

17:19.080 --> 17:20.624
You know we're both dead.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.961
Stay on the paths! Stay on it!

17:31.635 --> 17:33.303
Get down. Get down.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.352
Don't move.

17:49.945 --> 17:51.446
Come on, give me your hands.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.006
Bastards!

18:11.133 --> 18:12.134
Back to the van?

18:12.217 --> 18:14.344
I'm going back to the van.
You're going the other way.

18:15.429 --> 18:17.139
Where are you?

18:17.222 --> 18:19.433
-Run!
-Where are you?

18:19.516 --> 18:20.517
Fuck!

18:21.894 --> 18:22.978
Fuck!

18:25.856 --> 18:27.482
I fucked up! He gave me the slip!

18:27.566 --> 18:29.359
-What? Fucking where?
-I don't know!

19:38.178 --> 19:39.596
Where am I?

19:54.194 --> 19:56.321
I want you to bring
the boy's parents to London

19:56.405 --> 19:57.865
ahead of a successful outcome.

19:57.948 --> 19:59.825
Do not let the press get wind of this.

19:59.908 --> 20:00.909
Diana.

20:00.993 --> 20:02.870
Diana. Your office.

20:03.495 --> 20:04.496
Ma'amâ¦

20:10.752 --> 20:13.672
The kidnappers are headed for Harwich,
and the Dogs are en route.

20:14.673 --> 20:17.676
Wellâ¦ Now we wait.

20:19.511 --> 20:21.513
-Slow Horses in the building?
-They've been cleared.

20:22.598 --> 20:24.766
It appears Alan Black was operating alone.

20:25.976 --> 20:29.188
Either he was trying to be the hero,
or he went full right-wing nationalist.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.732
-It's hard to tell.
-Either version makes us look terrible.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.360
I'd prefer his story died with him.

20:35.903 --> 20:37.696
It's being written out already.

20:37.779 --> 20:41.992
Can I request he's kept out? No witnessesâ¦

20:43.076 --> 20:45.704
They are dangerous men.
They will be met with force.

21:01.428 --> 21:04.556
Look, it's been a while for me, okay?

21:04.640 --> 21:05.641
Since you had sex?

21:05.724 --> 21:07.476
No, no, si--

21:07.559 --> 21:09.895
since I've been with someone
who doesn't completely fucking loathe me.

21:11.063 --> 21:16.443
Andâ¦ you know, us--
us kissing in the stairwell, that was--

21:16.527 --> 21:17.694
I mean, that was good.

21:18.612 --> 21:21.281
It was great. But then us going upstairs
with the paperweight

21:21.365 --> 21:22.950
and the stapler, that was amazing.

21:23.033 --> 21:25.869
I mean, that was--
You know, we were good. We were a team.

21:27.162 --> 21:30.958
You know.
I mean, we had each other's back.

21:31.917 --> 21:32.960
Bit cheesy.

21:34.837 --> 21:39.174
And now we've got no petrol and no way
to catch up to the bastards, soâ¦

21:39.258 --> 21:41.969
We were never gonna catch them, were we?

21:42.052 --> 21:44.972
Just felt good being part of
something, didn't it, you know?

21:49.184 --> 21:50.185
Two years.

21:51.937 --> 21:53.272
Since you last had sex?

21:53.897 --> 21:54.898
God, no.

21:56.650 --> 21:57.818
Since someone had my back.

22:02.823 --> 22:04.449
-There's Lamb!
-Lamb!

22:05.534 --> 22:06.535
Lamb!

22:06.618 --> 22:09.454
-Hey!
-Hey! For fuck's sake!

22:10.163 --> 22:11.290
You not gonna stop?

22:11.373 --> 22:13.041
We're ten minutes from Harwich.

22:13.125 --> 22:17.880
Dogs, bad guys, guns.
You want to miss the show?

23:26.990 --> 23:27.991
We have a visual.

23:28.075 --> 23:30.327
They're armed. Lethal force authorized.

23:42.381 --> 23:46.009
Listen to me! Listen to me!
Get down! On your knees!

23:48.178 --> 23:49.388
Get down on your knees.

23:56.061 --> 23:57.187
Hands visible!

24:00.691 --> 24:02.651
Keep your hands visible!

24:04.862 --> 24:06.321
He's reaching. Drop him.

24:15.789 --> 24:18.417
All units to Control.
Target down, target down.

24:24.256 --> 24:25.340
Van is empty, ma'am.

24:43.609 --> 24:44.776
Suspect was armed, ma'am.

24:47.905 --> 24:49.740
Retrace the route. Meter by meter.

24:51.491 --> 24:52.993
Van got to Harwich.

24:53.076 --> 24:57.414
Dogs shredded a kidnapper.
Pretty wild. I got some headcam footage.

24:57.915 --> 25:00.000
Taverner's not taking any prisoners.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.543
Roddy, Roddy. Hassan?

25:04.129 --> 25:06.757
No sign of him or the other kidnappers.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.509
Where did the van last stop?

25:09.134 --> 25:11.261
-Lay-by. Five miles behind you.
-Shit.

25:20.103 --> 25:23.190
You know, I knew you were trying to turn
him when you were dumping that body.

25:23.690 --> 25:27.152
And I knew he was never a real soldier.
No harm done.

25:28.403 --> 25:29.613
Apart from him scalping you.

25:30.239 --> 25:33.033
Head wounds bleed.
It all worked out in the end.

25:33.742 --> 25:36.662
He got away. How is that "all worked out"?

25:36.745 --> 25:39.164
-I let him go.
-Sure.

25:39.248 --> 25:43.752
Not that you're a crap shot.
That's not why he escaped. You let him go.

25:43.836 --> 25:46.171
Listen, I could shoot you right now, mate.

25:46.255 --> 25:48.173
But we're gonna do things medieval,

25:48.257 --> 25:50.259
which is appropriate,
considering your religion.

25:51.927 --> 25:54.179
You don't know the first thing
about my religion.

26:08.026 --> 26:10.028
What the fuck. They've come back.

26:14.908 --> 26:16.285
Well, come on. Get in, then!

26:20.581 --> 26:21.832
Fuck.

26:23.166 --> 26:25.627
-We forgot to get petrol.
-We?

26:29.965 --> 26:31.008
There.

26:32.509 --> 26:35.012
What the fuck are you laughing at?
You're gonna die up there.

26:35.095 --> 26:37.514
-That's not a Norman castle.
-Yes it fucking is!

26:37.598 --> 26:39.349
-It's a folly.
-It's a what?

26:39.433 --> 26:41.310
A folly. A fake.

26:41.393 --> 26:43.061
Fake how? It's still a castle.

26:43.145 --> 26:46.648
It's around 150 years old,
built to look older.

26:46.732 --> 26:49.109
Why would people build ruins?
That makes no sense.

26:49.610 --> 26:51.862
Because they wanted to impress people.

26:51.945 --> 26:54.114
Because they th-thought
that it was romantic.

26:54.198 --> 26:56.116
-Because they thought it was English.
-It is English.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.367
It's fake.

26:57.451 --> 27:00.787
Seems I paid more attention in my madrassa
than you did in school.

27:03.165 --> 27:05.417
Get up. Get the fuck up. Move.

27:06.001 --> 27:07.002
Move!

27:09.880 --> 27:10.923
Keep going.

27:17.012 --> 27:18.013
In there.

27:36.573 --> 27:37.783
Are you sure this is right?

27:38.450 --> 27:42.079
You are at the right location.
I've done my bit. Over to you.

27:42.162 --> 27:45.123
Right. Ho, there's no "I" in "team,"
but there is a big "fuck you" in fuck you.

27:45.207 --> 27:47.584
Roddy, Roddy, there's nothing here.
Look again.

27:47.668 --> 27:49.253
That is where they stopped.

27:49.336 --> 27:50.879
This is the place.

27:50.963 --> 27:53.590
Three men came into the woods.
One came out.

27:53.674 --> 27:56.093
I'm assuming the one
who took the van to Harwich.

27:56.176 --> 27:57.177
How do you know?

27:57.719 --> 27:59.555
Reading the signs of the earth.

27:59.638 --> 28:01.473
What, like snapped branches,
trampled grass?

28:02.182 --> 28:04.685
No, you dozy sod.
The dead body over there.

28:08.814 --> 28:10.065
Fuck me.

28:44.683 --> 28:46.560
Cleared to shoot on sight.

28:47.102 --> 28:48.395
Affirmative.

29:12.252 --> 29:13.378
So what now?

29:14.588 --> 29:15.672
You kill me.

29:15.756 --> 29:17.883
Put it on YouTube. Run to the boat.

29:23.805 --> 29:24.806
Kneel.

29:25.641 --> 29:27.226
Fuckin' kneel!

29:28.769 --> 29:29.895
The boat is blown.

29:29.978 --> 29:31.980
Once that video's online, they'll be here,

29:32.064 --> 29:35.150
and either they take me out,
or I use the last one on myself.

29:39.988 --> 29:43.408
So you become a martyr.
Like all the suicide bombers.

29:43.492 --> 29:46.286
It's about being part of
something bigger than yourself.

29:47.037 --> 29:50.624
Not that you'd understand.
I'm putting this country first.

29:51.834 --> 29:53.043
It's what won us the war.

29:53.794 --> 29:55.879
You are so fucking stu--

30:00.217 --> 30:01.593
Told you I was a good shot.

30:02.177 --> 30:04.137
Next one's in your balls.

30:25.784 --> 30:28.412
Hassan, Hassan! Hassan. Stop, stop.

30:28.495 --> 30:29.830
-Who are you with?
-I'm with MI5.

30:29.913 --> 30:32.541
You're safe. You're safe now.
Look. Put it down. Give me the axe.

30:32.624 --> 30:34.459
-You're gonna stop me?
-You don't want to kill him.

30:34.543 --> 30:36.003
-He's done. Finished.
-Like fuck I don't!

30:36.086 --> 30:37.462
Hassan. Look at me, Hassan. No.

30:37.546 --> 30:39.673
No. No! Hassan, Hassan!

30:42.050 --> 30:43.510
You make me ashamed to be British.

30:43.594 --> 30:45.429
All right. Come on. Let's step away.
Step away.

30:45.512 --> 30:47.264
Back up. Back up. Good man.

31:03.030 --> 31:04.573
Twenty seconds to target.

31:08.327 --> 31:09.786
Okay. Okay.

31:09.870 --> 31:13.624
Okay. Okay. Let's just sit down.
There you are. Okay.

31:13.707 --> 31:16.168
Okay. Hassan? I'm gonna have to stop
the bleeding on that arm.

31:17.044 --> 31:18.337
That's it, that's it.

31:18.420 --> 31:19.838
There you are. Good man.

31:19.922 --> 31:21.965
Can you ring my parents?

31:22.633 --> 31:24.801
Don't really have a phone
at the minute. Sorry.

31:24.885 --> 31:26.136
What kind of spy are you?

31:27.137 --> 31:28.180
Yeah. Hard to tell, really.

31:40.317 --> 31:42.528
-Who's that?
-That's Cartwright and the Slow Horses.

31:45.447 --> 31:47.491
Assessing target. Stand by.

31:54.206 --> 31:56.124
Intel confirms bomb threat.

31:56.208 --> 31:57.251
Southeast wall.

32:00.295 --> 32:01.547
Kill order confirmed.

32:02.673 --> 32:04.216
There you are. You've done it now.

32:05.008 --> 32:07.886
Are they gonna kill him?
He should go on trial.

32:10.556 --> 32:12.766
Min! What are you doing?

32:12.850 --> 32:14.726
Friendly approaching target.

32:18.146 --> 32:19.314
He's unarmed!

32:20.941 --> 32:21.942
Jesus.

32:22.734 --> 32:24.152
Clear the shot!

32:25.404 --> 32:28.407
-Piss off! Stop!
-What the fuck are you doing?

32:28.490 --> 32:30.492
You're gonna get yourself freaking killed!

32:30.576 --> 32:33.245
Suspect is armed. Clear the shot!

32:33.328 --> 32:36.290
You are impeding an official operation!

32:36.373 --> 32:37.916
Clear! Now!

33:00.522 --> 33:01.648
No clear shot, sir.

33:02.357 --> 33:03.775
Piss off!

33:03.859 --> 33:04.860
Ma'am?

33:07.070 --> 33:08.322
Ma'am?

33:09.740 --> 33:10.824
Stand down.

33:12.868 --> 33:14.161
Fuck off.

33:43.315 --> 33:44.316
Diana.

33:51.782 --> 33:54.284
Your idiot Slow Horses have screwed
the entire service.

33:55.369 --> 33:56.537
The boy was saved.

33:56.620 --> 33:59.873
The boy and the surviving kidnapper
both know we had an agent on the inside.

33:59.957 --> 34:02.000
-I'll handle that.
-Like you handled the rest of this?

34:04.545 --> 34:06.547
Alan Black has been wiped
from our records,

34:06.630 --> 34:08.549
and I'll make sure Hassan says nothing.

34:08.632 --> 34:11.467
You better fucking had!
This is your shit, Diana.

34:11.552 --> 34:12.553
Clean it up!

35:41.683 --> 35:45.646
I'm joined now by our Home
Security correspondent, Derek Rothery.

35:45.729 --> 35:49.650
Derek, what can you tell us
about the investigation so far?

35:49.733 --> 35:52.402
We understand
that First Desk, Ingrid Tearney,

35:52.486 --> 35:55.030
will be debriefing
the Home Secretary later on today

35:55.614 --> 36:00.494
on what has been a successful operation
to rescue kidnapped student Hassan Ahmed.

36:00.577 --> 36:02.913
I'd just like to say thank you

36:02.996 --> 36:07.543
to the police a-and the security services

36:07.626 --> 36:10.504
for their really, really incredible work.

36:11.004 --> 36:13.841
We understand he was freed
shortly after 7:00 a.m. this morning

36:13.924 --> 36:18.095
by an MI5 operation in which
two of the kidnappers were killed,

36:18.178 --> 36:20.597
and a further man remains in custody.

36:24.560 --> 36:27.229
Well, I suppose well done, us.

36:27.938 --> 36:30.691
I've got a bottle of wine
in the desk if anyone wants to celebrate.

36:31.567 --> 36:33.360
Celebrate? What?

36:34.528 --> 36:35.529
Well, we saved him.

36:35.612 --> 36:38.115
How? You-- You were useless.

36:38.198 --> 36:39.449
I tracked the van.

36:39.533 --> 36:42.160
Yeah, to Harwich,
where the Dogs were waiting for him.

36:42.244 --> 36:43.704
Thanks to me squeezing Lady Di.

36:43.787 --> 36:45.664
Yeah, well, I actually did save him.

36:45.747 --> 36:47.749
Whilst he was being shot at
and threatened with an axe.

36:47.833 --> 36:50.794
The kid saved himself, with a rock.

36:50.878 --> 36:52.838
I just love these team talks, I really do.

36:54.423 --> 36:56.341
Come on, everyone. Back to work!

36:56.425 --> 36:57.551
It's Saturday.

36:57.634 --> 36:59.386
Then everyone piss off!

36:59.469 --> 37:00.470
Drink?

37:03.724 --> 37:05.100
Got a lead on Sid.

37:13.942 --> 37:15.777
Okay. Wine.

37:20.157 --> 37:23.202
Right. Well, I hope you don't mind,
a vin de Tesco.

37:24.244 --> 37:26.121
Yeah. I'll get some glasses.

37:27.122 --> 37:28.957
-All right.
-Actually, you know what, Min?

37:29.041 --> 37:34.880
I-- I am-- I'm shattered.
I'm gonna crash. Sorry.

37:35.839 --> 37:36.965
Yeah. Sure. Sure.

37:37.049 --> 37:38.258
It's been a long day.

37:38.759 --> 37:39.885
Yeah. No, I'm tired too.

37:44.181 --> 37:48.435
But I am free tonight for some drinks orâ¦

37:49.311 --> 37:50.729
maybe some food or something.

37:50.812 --> 37:51.813
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah?

37:51.897 --> 37:53.106
Great. Sounds good.

37:54.274 --> 37:56.068
Yeah, I'm just thinking how about--

37:56.151 --> 37:59.112
Well, how about I just actually
stop talking before I spoil everything?

37:59.196 --> 38:00.197
Smart.

38:19.466 --> 38:21.760
-See?
-See what? I don't see anything.

38:21.844 --> 38:22.845
Exactly.

38:22.928 --> 38:25.389
There's no record of her
ever having been at the hospital.

38:25.472 --> 38:27.724
And, when I pop through
my own private backdoor

38:27.808 --> 38:29.101
into MI5's database,

38:29.184 --> 38:31.228
there's no record of her whatsoever.

38:31.311 --> 38:32.729
So what does that mean?

38:34.273 --> 38:38.694
It means, far as you know,
and even as far as Roddy Ho knows,

38:38.777 --> 38:41.655
which is a fuck of a lot farther
than anyone has ever known,

38:42.239 --> 38:44.324
there is gonna be
no funeral or memorial service

38:44.408 --> 38:46.660
or so much as drinks at the pub
for Sidonie Baker.

38:48.537 --> 38:51.373
'Cause no one
named Sidonie Baker ever existed.

38:58.547 --> 39:01.133
So, in return?

39:03.594 --> 39:04.595
In return for what?

39:04.678 --> 39:07.848
For letting you know
she might still be alive somewhere.

39:10.184 --> 39:11.185
You wanna know?

39:15.397 --> 39:16.398
All right.

39:18.192 --> 39:19.193
Wellâ¦

39:21.862 --> 39:25.240
thing is, Roddy, you're in Slough Houseâ¦

39:33.999 --> 39:35.167
because you're too good.

39:37.169 --> 39:39.171
You showed everyone else up.

39:39.254 --> 39:41.798
Made them all look bad,
so they shoved you in here.

39:46.637 --> 39:47.638
Figures.

39:50.933 --> 39:52.142
Tried to cage me upâ¦

39:53.936 --> 39:55.771
but you can't cage a dragon.

40:06.949 --> 40:07.950
All right.

41:20.814 --> 41:24.526
Natasha. You need to bring me in
and put me on air.

41:26.236 --> 41:28.739
But what you're seeing
on the news is bullshit!

41:28.822 --> 41:31.491
Establishment cover-up bullshit.

41:33.035 --> 41:34.036
Well, send a car.

41:35.329 --> 41:39.082
I can get there quicker by myself.
I can be there in--

41:42.252 --> 41:45.005
Jesus. You all right, mate? You all right?

41:45.088 --> 41:46.840
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

41:57.559 --> 41:58.560
Diana.

41:59.061 --> 42:00.062
Jackson.

42:01.772 --> 42:02.814
Well done.

42:02.898 --> 42:06.276
Managed to keep the name Alan Black
out of the headlines.

42:06.360 --> 42:08.111
Never existed.

42:08.737 --> 42:11.073
You mean Dermot Radcliffe, Son of Albion.

42:15.160 --> 42:20.249
Hassan didn't overhear anything
that might poke holes in that?

42:20.332 --> 42:21.333
Possibly.

42:21.834 --> 42:23.460
But his student debt's been cleared,

42:23.544 --> 42:26.922
and his comedy club is about to receive
a large anonymous donation.

42:29.758 --> 42:31.593
Do you know what boils my piss?

42:33.011 --> 42:34.012
Is that you won.

42:35.055 --> 42:38.559
Boy saved, you get to look like a hero.

42:38.642 --> 42:40.811
Made your boss look even more of a hero.

42:42.479 --> 42:44.731
What are you gonna tell Standish
about what's in that file?

42:48.110 --> 42:50.195
And the photographs on Cartwright's phone?

42:51.154 --> 42:52.155
Deleted.

42:52.698 --> 42:54.116
Can I trust you on that?

42:56.118 --> 42:58.662
Can I trust you
you didn't make a copy of this?

43:00.122 --> 43:02.833
I'm assuming you don't want
Struan Loy back.

43:03.917 --> 43:06.753
Well, you put him
in a very difficult position, Diana.

43:06.837 --> 43:10.507
Betray me, get back to the Park.
Or don't and be cast into the wilderness.

43:10.591 --> 43:12.551
He betrayed you, so wilderness.

43:12.634 --> 43:13.677
Fuck yeah.

43:14.761 --> 43:16.096
And River Cartwright?

43:39.244 --> 43:41.622
I'm sorry, but what did you expect?

43:41.705 --> 43:45.626
Well, Stansted wasn't me.
And we rescued Hassan.

43:45.709 --> 43:50.881
Soâ¦ clean slate back at the Park
didn't feel like too much of a stretch.

43:50.964 --> 43:51.965
So you thought, what?

43:52.049 --> 43:54.259
Diana Taverner would confess her sins

43:54.343 --> 43:58.639
in order to benefit your career
while simultaneously destroying her own?

43:58.722 --> 44:00.390
Tad naive, wouldn't you say?

44:00.933 --> 44:04.102
Moscow rules, watch your back.
London rules, cover your arse.

44:04.186 --> 44:05.187
Yeah.

44:07.064 --> 44:11.652
I seem to have covered her arse,
while she stabbed me straight in the back.

44:12.361 --> 44:15.822
I will permit one evening
of indulgent self-recrimination,

44:15.906 --> 44:20.035
which will end when I nod off
after approximately 20 minutes.

44:22.120 --> 44:23.872
You need to get your head down.

44:23.956 --> 44:28.877
Keep your nose clean, and then maybe,
just maybe, there's a way back in.

44:32.214 --> 44:33.549
Oh, come on.

44:33.632 --> 44:36.343
Even the best spies have
their time in the cold.

44:37.511 --> 44:40.514
Smiley was always coming back
from redundancy.

45:57.966 --> 45:59.176
Charles.

46:01.178 --> 46:03.096
There are things
about Charles Partner's death

46:03.180 --> 46:04.973
that Lamb hasn't told you.

46:22.199 --> 46:23.617
What was Taverner going to tell me?

46:23.700 --> 46:27.329
For fuck's sake. It's-- It's Saturday.

46:27.412 --> 46:29.748
Haven't you got
other people's cats to steal?

46:29.831 --> 46:32.417
What aren't you telling me
about Charles's death?

46:32.501 --> 46:33.502
Nothing.

46:34.545 --> 46:38.757
I don't believe you.
I should have read the signs. Should I?

46:45.931 --> 46:47.182
Tell me. What don't I--

46:47.266 --> 46:48.767
I gave him the gun.

46:54.523 --> 46:55.524
Why?

47:01.113 --> 47:02.614
Because he asked for one.

47:05.492 --> 47:06.577
And he was my friend.

47:13.542 --> 47:15.627
This was after the Wall came down.

47:19.464 --> 47:22.259
Cold War scores were being settled.

47:23.010 --> 47:26.513
And he told me
he'd seen some old, unfriendly faces.

47:26.597 --> 47:28.098
I thought he was being paranoid,

47:28.182 --> 47:31.310
butâ¦ you know, what if I was wrong,
and he ended--

47:37.107 --> 47:38.775
Well, it threw my mojo off.

47:41.820 --> 47:43.572
Put a dent in my armor.

47:49.161 --> 47:54.833
I-I didn't want to be in the field.
I wanted to be a civilian even less.

47:58.587 --> 48:02.841
Soâ¦ this is why I asked for this place.

48:06.970 --> 48:10.933
Somewhere where I could run out the clock.

48:13.268 --> 48:15.521
Nothing matters, and no one gets hurt.

48:27.157 --> 48:29.618
Oh, come on.
One of us has to leave the room now.

48:32.621 --> 48:34.206
And I'm just too fucking tired.

50:34.785 --> 50:35.786
Is it done?

50:39.831 --> 50:40.832
Yeah.

50:44.253 --> 50:45.879
And so am I.

50:46.922 --> 50:48.131
If they find outâ¦

50:51.593 --> 50:54.847
How would they find out, David?
It's just you and me in this car.

50:54.930 --> 50:57.057
They are rather good at their job.

50:59.601 --> 51:02.980
Well, I hope for your sake they don't.

52:01.371 --> 52:04.041
When an agent dies,
everything has to be considered.

52:04.124 --> 52:07.211
Well, he left a note on his phone.
"Cicada."

52:07.794 --> 52:10.339
Sleeper agents embedded
in British society.

52:10.422 --> 52:12.424
We call them dead lions.

52:12.508 --> 52:14.968
Lamb, I do not need you
digging around in the past.

52:15.677 --> 52:19.473
Maybe the Cicadas have been reactivated,
and maybe more people are gonna die.

52:19.556 --> 52:21.225
I'm putting you in the field.

52:21.934 --> 52:23.769
-What?
-It's exciting.

52:26.021 --> 52:27.523
Be careful, River.

52:27.606 --> 52:32.402
The Russians have an incredible capacity
for pain and sacrifice. And grudges.

52:33.320 --> 52:35.739
We had a traitor right at the top.

52:35.822 --> 52:37.783
Thousands of people, they're gonna die.

52:37.866 --> 52:39.868
Paperwork's gonna be a ballache.

52:40.452 --> 52:43.914
I want the professional humiliation
of you and your team.

52:44.998 --> 52:47.751
My team have already
humiliated themselves.

52:49.253 --> 52:51.129
That's why they're my team.
