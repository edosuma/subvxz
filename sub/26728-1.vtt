WEBVTT

01:10.352 --> 01:11.138
We have touch down.

01:11.162 --> 01:15.159
Donor is on site.
I repeat. Donor is on site.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.835
The donor signed the releases, cleared?

01:23.836 --> 01:24.639
We are cleared

01:30.506 --> 01:32.800
Atention. Donor in route to main lab.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.968
All tech personnel please report
to the operating theatre

01:37.877 --> 01:41.440
I repeat. All tech personnel please
report to the operating theatre

01:50.848 --> 01:51.424
Ready

01:56.128 --> 01:58.240
Time since cardiac death?

01:58.354 --> 02:00.331
7 hours 15 minutes

02:02.862 --> 02:04.876
Proceed

02:18.131 --> 02:20.800
Neural tissue intact.
Protoplasmic integrity looks good.

02:21.280 --> 02:23.200
We have a viable cortex.
Do you concur?

02:24.160 --> 02:25.120
I concur

02:26.080 --> 02:27.520
Ball's in your court, William

02:32.160 --> 02:33.760
This man is dead

02:34.638 --> 02:37.324
Yet his neurological
data is still accessible

02:38.272 --> 02:41.632
We are going to take his biological brain

02:41.633 --> 02:44.896
imprint it into that synthetic brain

02:45.088 --> 02:47.092
replicate the human mind

02:47.488 --> 02:50.752
Ed, boot the mapping sequence

02:55.456 --> 02:57.760
Optical positioning optimal

02:57.856 --> 03:00.160
- Target acquired
- Lacrimal targetting complete

03:01.024 --> 03:04.268
- Standby to engage neural probe
- Standby for neural probe

03:05.152 --> 03:05.920
Standby

03:09.472 --> 03:12.013
Initiating transfer

03:18.556 --> 03:20.598
Main drive is online

03:27.269 --> 03:30.207
- Ok mapping confirmed
- Remove the donor

03:38.929 --> 03:41.779
Standby to initiate the neural imprint

03:47.481 --> 03:49.305
Initiate

04:15.445 --> 04:20.119
Scott, try protocol Alpha-9, please.
Parietal.

04:23.037 --> 04:23.997
Thank you

04:29.536 --> 04:32.992
Temporal and axon online. Good.

04:35.594 --> 04:38.247
Frontal bone online looking good

04:39.520 --> 04:41.164
Okay

04:43.121 --> 04:46.954
Connect protocol 345

04:47.926 --> 04:50.776
801 two-phase application

04:51.706 --> 04:57.560
P1. Site parameters - AP insula.
Primary action.

04:58.657 --> 05:04.379
Stasis modality. Exception.
And translate.

05:05.153 --> 05:08.194
Finalised. Confirmed.

05:08.202 --> 05:10.026
All states, go.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.037
All functions. Go.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.497
Imprint complete

05:25.468 --> 05:29.213
Margaret, energise the body.

05:46.384 --> 05:48.426
Sergeant Kelly

05:56.250 --> 05:59.002
Do you hear me?

06:00.991 --> 06:02.881
Sergeant

06:09.607 --> 06:11.497
Who am I

06:15.310 --> 06:21.907
Sergeant, you've transitioned
to a synthetic body

06:25.848 --> 06:28.720
Try to relax. You're coming online.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.636
It will take some time

06:35.361 --> 06:40.254
- Who am I?
- Sergeant, try to relax.

06:40.326 --> 06:42.238
Who am I?

06:42.280 --> 06:44.169
Sergeant

06:47.982 --> 06:49.872
Sergeant! Sergeant Kelly!

06:49.904 --> 06:52.722
- Who am I?!
- Sergeant Kelly!

06:53.620 --> 06:55.531
Turn it off, the imprint failed.

06:56.663 --> 06:58.519
Severed the override

07:06.112 --> 07:07.193
Who am I?

07:19.360 --> 07:20.992
RTX. Proceed to 07.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.968
- It spoke.
- They've done that before.

07:24.256 --> 07:26.321
No they vocalised before. Make noise.

07:26.356 --> 07:28.246
- This one spoke.
- And I can't tell you

07:28.278 --> 07:30.167
how amazing that would
have been 8 months ago.

07:30.168 --> 07:32.320
Today it just annoys the shit out of me

07:32.416 --> 07:36.826
- It's progress. Undeniable progress.
- In my world progress is measured in results.

07:36.831 --> 07:37.600
Which we don't have

07:37.792 --> 07:40.760
The truth is I'm not sure how much longer

07:40.771 --> 07:41.787
I can keep the lights on

07:41.828 --> 07:45.508
Turns out colossal and repeated failure

07:45.543 --> 07:48.361
Tends to spook shareholders. Who knew?

07:48.394 --> 07:50.283
This is my life's work

07:50.284 --> 07:52.359
I've moved my family here. Made sacrifices.

07:52.367 --> 07:55.982
I promise you, I am this close.

07:56.128 --> 07:59.118
Well. That just isn't
close enough is it, Bill

07:59.125 --> 08:02.871
But don't let it ruin
your weekend or anything

08:05.627 --> 08:06.773
Oh shit

08:25.776 --> 08:27.687
- I'm sorry I'm late
- It's okay

08:27.698 --> 08:30.570
- How is it going, honey?
- The kids haven't even packed

08:35.385 --> 08:36.466
Daddy!

08:37.499 --> 08:39.323
Zoe!

08:40.222 --> 08:44.000
- How is it going? How's your day?
- Matt!

08:45.988 --> 08:47.844
Not in the house, I know

08:47.878 --> 08:49.920
Told him not stop spying me with that thing

08:49.927 --> 08:52.712
- It is called a spy-drone
- Okay

08:52.714 --> 08:55.532
So go pack now. Don't jump on the furniture

08:56.558 --> 08:58.535
- Hola, Foster family!
- Ed!

08:58.576 --> 09:01.361
- Hey, nugget
- Hey, can you feed him once a day

09:01.363 --> 09:03.136
but don't overfeed him
I'll show you the food, come on

09:03.232 --> 09:04.096
Okay

09:05.440 --> 09:09.009
- Hey, you talked to Jones?
- Something like that

09:09.019 --> 09:10.996
Okay, what did he say? Did you get fired?

09:11.037 --> 09:12.926
- What's "fired"?
- I didn't get fired

09:12.927 --> 09:15.679
- Who got fired? -Daddy
- What?

09:15.714 --> 09:16.762
Nobody got fired

09:16.867 --> 09:20.580
- I thought you were a gonna, man
- Wait, what's going on?

09:20.582 --> 09:24.361
Our test subject ripped itself apart
earlier today It was pretty brutal

09:24.394 --> 09:25.410
What's "brutal"?

09:29.199 --> 09:32.978
It spoke, Mona. 345 the test subject

09:33.139 --> 09:35.891
- It actually spoke
- It spoke?

09:35.894 --> 09:37.871
If it could speak then it could feel

09:37.912 --> 09:39.616
We shut it down as soon as possible

09:39.712 --> 09:41.668
You can just keep bringing
people back from the dead

09:41.692 --> 09:43.581
until you have this stuff worked out

09:44.478 --> 09:47.296
How many times have you had a
patient flatlined in the ER

09:47.297 --> 09:48.376
and you brought them back?

09:48.387 --> 09:50.080
My patients don't rip themselves apart

09:50.560 --> 09:52.000
She's got a point there, William

09:53.255 --> 09:58.115
I should probably food
find Sophie for the fish

09:59.885 --> 10:02.758
William, honey, I believe in you

10:02.801 --> 10:04.712
But I don't like where this is headed

10:04.755 --> 10:06.579
People could suffer

10:06.580 --> 10:09.617
The first heart transplant
patient survived 18 days

10:09.655 --> 10:13.456
- He suffered. Was that wrong?
- No

10:13.468 --> 10:16.187
I'm on the verge of a breakthrough, Mona

10:16.222 --> 10:18.231
Soldiers, accident victims, alzheimers

10:18.240 --> 10:20.216
Lives won't have to be cut short

10:20.226 --> 10:23.939
But something's preventing the synthetic
from achieving consciousness

10:23.974 --> 10:25.950
Maybe there's more that makes it human

10:25.992 --> 10:27.848
Like a soul

10:28.906 --> 10:31.494
We're the some told of
what is happened to us

10:31.533 --> 10:32.581
and how we processed it

10:32.591 --> 10:33.639
that's what it make us such

10:33.679 --> 10:37.360
- It's all neurochemistry.
- Do you really believe that?

10:37.396 --> 10:40.333
That's all I am? Your children?

10:41.111 --> 10:43.983
Just pathways, electrical
signals and chemistry?

10:44.025 --> 10:45.060
You have kids that love you

10:45.083 --> 10:46.995
and a wife that adores you

10:47.005 --> 10:49.877
And we have a scientist

10:56.518 --> 10:57.631
Do you think I should quit?

10:57.639 --> 10:59.496
Hi -Hi -Hi

11:00.459 --> 11:04.357
I'm just worried you're losing sight
of what's right and wrong

11:07.313 --> 11:11.114
I won't. Trust me

11:13.879 --> 11:15.769
Okay have fun

11:16.891 --> 11:18.585
I'm gonna get you back

11:18.717 --> 11:23.391
- What's the boat called again?
- It's called the <i>Cheatin' Hussy</i>

11:23.425 --> 11:26.275
- Daddy!
- Keys are in the bait box

11:26.308 --> 11:28.284
- We don't do that
- Daddy!

11:28.294 --> 11:31.079
Thanks. See you on Sunday night

11:31.177 --> 11:33.088
Everybody in?

11:33.131 --> 11:34.856
Seat belts

11:34.860 --> 11:37.962
The Foster family ferry to
funtown is ready to sail

11:37.999 --> 11:38.928
Yay!

11:38.929 --> 11:39.999
Really, dad

11:40.960 --> 11:43.472
Hoist the mainsail, Cap.

11:55.105 --> 11:58.010
I spied with my little
eyes something that is

11:58.019 --> 12:00.869
Bored. There is possibly adopted.

12:00.870 --> 12:02.760
That would be me

12:03.818 --> 12:06.788
Hey dad, when we get there
can we go fishing on a boat?

12:06.796 --> 12:08.522
Absolutely

12:08.558 --> 12:10.415
Are we almost there?

12:10.448 --> 12:12.556
We could wait for the boat to float by

12:13.363 --> 12:15.307
You know what they say

12:15.316 --> 12:17.260
If you don't like the
weather just wait 5 minutes

12:19.193 --> 12:22.841
I can't see anything
Can you see anything?

12:22.876 --> 12:24.023
I feel that we should pull over

12:31.750 --> 12:36.293
- Okay? Everybody okay?
- Holy shit!

12:36.330 --> 12:37.476
That was close

12:39.340 --> 12:41.131
What?

12:41.231 --> 12:44.081
- Mum! -Mona!
- Mummy!

12:53.819 --> 12:55.512
Daddy!

13:23.385 --> 13:26.258
Mona?

13:27.261 --> 13:29.172
Kids?

13:33.956 --> 13:35.932
Oh god

13:36.998 --> 13:41.640
Sophie? Matt? Zoe?

14:06.788 --> 14:12.325
Zoe. God help my baby girl

14:29.851 --> 14:33.597
Mona?

14:52.851 --> 14:55.504
No

15:15.849 --> 15:19.530
William? What's up? What's going on?

15:19.565 --> 15:21.422
I told you no questions

15:21.455 --> 15:24.458
- Where is it?
- It's all in the back

15:47.401 --> 15:49.312
Oh shit

15:49.323 --> 15:53.353
William, what the hell happened man?

15:55.249 --> 15:58.099
I need you to do
something for me, Ed

16:01.751 --> 16:03.892
Oh no. No way I can't

16:03.897 --> 16:07.643
They are not gone. Not yet

16:07.645 --> 16:12.287
William, we need to call the police
or something man, I mean

16:15.268 --> 16:18.239
- William, what the hell?
- Boot the mapping sequence

16:18.280 --> 16:21.032
We cannot do this man

16:22.892 --> 16:26.725
Boot the mapping sequence, Ed

16:47.974 --> 16:51.687
Edward Whittle access granted

17:02.560 --> 17:06.098
Okay just because I think I can do it

17:06.103 --> 17:08.079
doesn't necessarily mean I can, okay

17:08.121 --> 17:10.971
There is a reason human cloning is banned

17:10.972 --> 17:11.988
And just because it's hard to do,

17:11.998 --> 17:14.903
- It's only half the issue here
- Just let me know what we need

17:15.201 --> 17:17.386
Look William, I know you've
been through hell but

17:17.387 --> 17:19.675
you need to understand something here

17:19.717 --> 17:23.332
The first few animals I
cloned came out blind

17:23.336 --> 17:24.960
Their skulls were deformed

17:25.066 --> 17:27.271
Their internal organs they
weren't internal anymore, man

17:27.276 --> 17:29.165
That's what a mistake here means

17:29.198 --> 17:32.016
And if we've made a mistake I need to know

17:32.018 --> 17:33.994
if you're prepared to terminate

17:35.893 --> 17:37.935
Just won't make a mistake

17:40.698 --> 17:41.812
Okay

17:44.477 --> 17:46.519
Those are pods

17:46.560 --> 17:52.195
Can I clone a human being, technically,
yeah, it's possible

17:52.198 --> 17:56.064
But look, William, if this works

17:56.073 --> 17:59.076
their brains are gonna
come out like infants

17:59.116 --> 18:00.874
Okay. A total blank slate

18:00.878 --> 18:02.953
and not to put salt in a wound

18:02.992 --> 18:06.705
but you've exactly worked out all
the kinks for transferring a mind

18:06.708 --> 18:09.493
Do I need to remember you what's
happened every single time you've try?

18:09.495 --> 18:13.274
We've transferred biological to
biological on cloned animals, Ed

18:13.306 --> 18:15.447
- Rats, monkeys
- Not human beings, man

18:15.453 --> 18:18.172
You've seen it. We can do it

18:18.175 --> 18:21.080
What if something horrible goes wrong?

18:22.916 --> 18:26.782
Something already has

18:37.906 --> 18:41.292
Ed, nobody can know what happened

18:45.147 --> 18:48.084
I need you to get rid of the bodies

18:50.784 --> 18:53.634
- William, I don't know if
- I'm begging you

18:53.635 --> 18:55.644
I can't do it

19:02.315 --> 19:04.324
Okay

19:04.366 --> 19:07.019
I'll meet you at the house

19:43.701 --> 19:45.590
What's in the barrels?

19:46.648 --> 19:49.269
Components. Building blocks

19:49.275 --> 19:51.415
Amino acids, fructose, accelerants

19:51.453 --> 19:54.074
You know just a ton of -

19:54.079 --> 19:57.017
Everything you need to build a you

20:02.856 --> 20:04.745
There are only 3 pods

20:05.771 --> 20:09.637
- I need 4 pods
- Yeah, I know there weren't 4

20:10.416 --> 20:13.517
- I need 4 pods, Ed
- I can maybe get another one

20:13.555 --> 20:15.412
in the next quarter maybe

20:16.181 --> 20:18.191
Do not tell me that there aren't 4

20:18.231 --> 20:20.208
What do you want me to do here?

20:20.217 --> 20:22.903
These pods are $1.7m each

20:22.940 --> 20:23.988
I'm not a freaking genie here okay

20:23.997 --> 20:26.869
I can not just sneeze out another pod

20:32.486 --> 20:34.528
Sorry, William

21:08.234 --> 21:10.024
William?

21:10.988 --> 21:12.932
You're alright?

21:15.121 --> 21:17.010
Pick a name

21:20.054 --> 21:22.926
No no

21:22.969 --> 21:24.913
Not enough pods

21:26.620 --> 21:29.657
- Pick a name
- No way, man

21:29.695 --> 21:30.613
You pick it

21:30.614 --> 21:34.337
- Please, god dammit, please pick a name
- William, no no

21:34.372 --> 21:37.223
- Pick a name!
- No, this one's on you

21:37.255 --> 21:39.167
You wanted this you pick it

21:41.099 --> 21:43.917
You pick the damn name

22:25.591 --> 22:29.080
You gotta watch the levels.
The levels are everything

22:29.083 --> 22:33.333
I seeded the pods with their DNA, but you
gotta keep an eye on them all the time

22:33.335 --> 22:34.399
Never leave them alone

22:34.400 --> 22:37.279
If the chemical balance isn't
maintained the clones will die

22:37.386 --> 22:38.623
and we can't just start over

22:38.660 --> 22:40.767
So you need to watch the levels

22:40.806 --> 22:43.526
Okay and they'll all be done
at the same time, right?

22:46.444 --> 22:48.268
Okay

22:49.167 --> 22:51.679
Shit, this is got a lot more difficult

22:57.527 --> 22:59.253
Tell me you can do that

22:59.680 --> 23:02.812
- Yeah, just got to compensate something
- Ed

23:02.844 --> 23:06.460
Yeah it can be done

23:08.482 --> 23:10.426
Where is your backup generator?

23:10.468 --> 23:14.247
- In case we lose power
- I don't have a generator, Ed

23:14.408 --> 23:18.024
- Okay
- Is there something I should know?

23:18.028 --> 23:21.652
Yeah, the pods can't lose power. Ever.

23:21.839 --> 23:24.686
If there's a 7-second power interruption

23:24.690 --> 23:25.673
that will throw off all the levels

23:25.715 --> 23:26.861
and I just told you how important

23:26.868 --> 23:29.013
those things are, so yeah,
we need a generator

23:29.119 --> 23:33.520
- It's 2am nothing's open
- Shit man, I don't know.

23:33.563 --> 23:36.249
What do you want from me? I
can't think of everything

23:36.254 --> 23:41.048
I am so far in over my head at this point

23:41.091 --> 23:42.139
And so are you man you know that

23:45.895 --> 23:47.905
Is there anything else?

23:48.714 --> 23:50.603
No, I think that's it

24:01.206 --> 24:04.079
That is a lot of batteries

24:10.080 --> 24:12.897
In 17 days they are coming out

24:13.667 --> 24:14.701
You got till then

24:14.724 --> 24:16.733
to figure out how to
give them consciousness

24:17.119 --> 24:20.959
If by some miracle we can pull this off

24:23.341 --> 24:25.318
What about Zoe?

24:39.840 --> 24:42.614
Every memory they had is in here

24:44.640 --> 24:46.666
I'll delete her

24:53.067 --> 24:55.939
I'll delete the memories

24:56.373 --> 24:58.054
You can do that?

24:58.864 --> 25:01.736
Humans lose memories all the time

25:03.701 --> 25:10.386
Beta amyloid proteins.
Neurofibrillary tangles

25:14.335 --> 25:17.240
I'll corrupt the memory

25:17.283 --> 25:20.898
Upload a new neural map

25:24.747 --> 25:27.717
They'll never remember her

25:29.647 --> 25:32.520
We are going straight to hell

25:38.359 --> 25:42.968
- Thank you
- Good luck, man

26:03.152 --> 26:06.025
Search parameters: Zoe

26:42.487 --> 26:45.338
Delete pathways and associations?

26:56.005 --> 26:57.796
Deleted

27:44.918 --> 27:47.856
Mr. Foster, this is the police

27:52.574 --> 27:54.463
Morning, officers

27:54.496 --> 27:56.473
Do you speak Spanish? No, sorry

27:56.578 --> 27:58.369
Well, pardon my English

27:58.372 --> 28:00.283
I am Officer Perez, this is Rodriguez

28:00.293 --> 28:03.078
We're following up on
some recent car robberies

28:03.112 --> 28:05.154
Somebody stolen the batteries
out of every car on the block

28:06.772 --> 28:07.946
How odd

28:07.981 --> 28:09.952
Did they get you too?

28:09.973 --> 28:12.298
No, they didn't

28:13.173 --> 28:14.860
You're the lucky guy

28:15.093 --> 28:15.946
Yeah

28:17.013 --> 28:18.933
Nothing out of the ordinary

28:19.680 --> 28:21.554
If you see anything or anybody suspicious

28:21.563 --> 28:24.906
- let us know
- Will do, officer

28:25.120 --> 28:26.268
Have a good day

28:32.134 --> 28:35.782
Okay. Alright.

28:35.913 --> 28:37.803
That happens

28:43.537 --> 28:45.361
Edward

28:49.238 --> 28:51.313
I feel compelled

28:51.353 --> 28:55.001
to comment on the noticable
lack of Bill around here

28:55.413 --> 28:57.983
Wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

28:58.912 --> 29:02.811
Just said that he had pneumonia

29:02.820 --> 29:03.554
Walking pneumonia

29:03.780 --> 29:05.653
- Walking?
- With pneumonia, yeah

29:05.760 --> 29:07.252
Would you convey a message for me?

29:07.529 --> 29:09.706
I spoke to the board today

29:09.813 --> 29:14.719
Unless 345 works, we'll gonna shutdown
at the end of the quarter

29:14.932 --> 29:16.273
Shutdown?

29:17.234 --> 29:19.091
Would you like a nice reference letter?

29:21.815 --> 29:24.916
Yeah, I'm sure he'll be in soon

29:24.954 --> 29:28.159
You know, William, he's got
a very strong immune system

29:41.194 --> 29:44.067
Test topics 221. Update

29:44.109 --> 29:48.816
Transfer of consciousness from original
subject to clone. Successful

29:49.682 --> 29:53.557
And consciousness can be transferred

29:55.513 --> 29:57.555
Why not human?

29:58.300 --> 30:00.244
What am I missing?

30:06.666 --> 30:08.373
- William
- Yeah?

30:08.692 --> 30:10.399
Hey, I just talked to Jones,

30:10.420 --> 30:12.773
and he said that if we
don't get 345 working

30:12.778 --> 30:15.040
- He's gonna shut us down
- Oh shit

30:15.093 --> 30:19.431
Yeah and there's $8.7m worth of
Bionyne equipment in your basement

30:19.472 --> 30:22.507
If he shut us down they
gonna come looking for it

30:22.515 --> 30:24.459
And you want to know
scientific term for that?

30:24.468 --> 30:26.932
Royally and utterly boned

30:26.944 --> 30:30.069
- So what are we going to do?
- Okay, get over here

30:30.175 --> 30:32.859
- What? Wait, where? There?
- Yeah, here

30:32.862 --> 30:36.343
- Why?
- I got to go to work, you got to watch the pods

30:36.385 --> 30:37.813
- Okay man, you don't have to yell
- I'm not yell-

30:39.652 --> 30:40.800
Okay, sorry, I was yelling

30:40.935 --> 30:44.420
- Just hurry up and you have pneumonia
- What?

30:46.412 --> 30:50.158
Dr. William Foster access granted

30:57.652 --> 31:00.319
There he is. Hi, Bill

31:00.426 --> 31:02.133
You look like hell

31:04.093 --> 31:06.186
Can I get anything?
Maybe something herbal?

31:06.933 --> 31:07.999
What do you have exactly?

31:08.959 --> 31:12.052
- Pneumonia
- What a chupa

31:16.320 --> 31:17.891
You're here

31:18.186 --> 31:22.080
I need you to review the data links
before I can work on 345 neural junctions

31:22.186 --> 31:24.747
- Yeah look, not now
- Jones's all over us

31:24.757 --> 31:27.570
William, we are waiting for your okay on the
MF interface for the server replacements

31:27.604 --> 31:30.641
- Get in line
- Okay

31:32.409 --> 31:34.321
You're alright?

31:35.356 --> 31:40.063
- I'm fine, why?
- No reason

32:21.002 --> 32:25.012
- Hello?
- I'm sorry about Matt

32:26.719 --> 32:29.968
You don't remember me?
Matt's teacher, Mrs. Barnes

32:30.880 --> 32:32.800
I can explain

32:32.855 --> 32:35.146
Your cousin told me. Sorry
to come by unannounced

32:35.150 --> 32:37.492
but Matt hadn't been to school a few days

32:37.599 --> 32:39.412
and I couldn't get to your
wife on her cellphone

32:39.612 --> 32:42.462
And I know we're not supposed
to have favorites, but

32:42.624 --> 32:45.376
Well I hope that clears everything up

32:46.403 --> 32:49.012
- Happy Holiday
- Happy Holidays

32:56.266 --> 32:58.293
- Is she gone?
- What happened?

32:58.399 --> 33:02.026
She said she had to go to the bathroom She
was banging on the door for like 5 minutes

33:02.037 --> 33:04.053
like a psychopath, I don't know
what was I supposed to do?

33:04.055 --> 33:07.252
What did you say? I said
that Matt had chickenpox

33:07.253 --> 33:09.367
and that he went to stay
with his grandparents

33:09.370 --> 33:13.546
His grandparents are dead, Ed.
How am I going to explain that?

33:13.653 --> 33:14.613
I dont' know, William

33:14.614 --> 33:17.919
Don't drag me into your giant
sucking hole of lies, okay?

33:17.920 --> 33:20.266
You didn't call the
school make something up?

33:20.800 --> 33:21.859
No

33:22.612 --> 33:24.775
What about the clinic that Mona works at?

33:25.492 --> 33:27.199
It's been 5 days

33:27.306 --> 33:30.399
You didn't think that anyone would have
noticed your entire family was missing?

33:30.480 --> 33:34.510
- I have a lot of things on my mind, Ed
- Yeah, sorry

33:35.284 --> 33:38.321
- You gonna have to deal with that
- How are they?

33:39.096 --> 33:41.170
They are a foot taller

34:08.949 --> 34:10.031
Really?

35:13.430 --> 35:15.254
I don't think so

35:28.906 --> 35:30.933
You think they really
going to shut us down?

35:30.934 --> 35:32.427
All I know is we need this robot ready

35:32.432 --> 35:34.026
before the next donor arrives

35:34.028 --> 35:35.733
Well, where's William?

36:40.300 --> 36:43.205
No, I don't want to hear anymore excuses

36:56.896 --> 36:59.549
What am I missing?

37:19.959 --> 37:23.672
Jesus, man. You look like
you're up to nefarious shit.

37:23.707 --> 37:27.485
And that's not a good look for someone who's
actually up to nefarious shit by the way.

37:27.679 --> 37:30.464
- I'm not ready
- No, I said 17 days

37:30.466 --> 37:33.404
It's been 17 days. There
is no "I'm not ready" here

37:33.412 --> 37:35.105
Ed

37:37.193 --> 37:38.209
Ed

37:40.076 --> 37:41.092
Ed!

37:42.959 --> 37:45.776
- Shit
- Ed

37:45.777 --> 37:47.667
Ed!

37:47.795 --> 37:49.619
Did you see that?

37:49.621 --> 37:51.598
I still don't know why it happened

37:51.607 --> 37:53.013
If I don't know what causes it

37:53.015 --> 37:54.488
how can I be certain it
won't happen to them?

37:54.522 --> 37:56.312
Yeah

37:56.348 --> 37:59.165
You have to thought about it 17 days ago

37:59.166 --> 38:03.065
The accelerants follow the
DNA profile precisely

38:03.106 --> 38:04.122
You keep them in the tanks

38:04.132 --> 38:05.922
they keep aging

38:05.957 --> 38:09.736
Your wife, 2 weeks from
now, cancer, maybe?

38:09.770 --> 38:12.853
Your daughter. Menopause?
Your son. I don't know.

38:12.854 --> 38:15.306
Male pattern baldness and
a droopy old man sack

38:15.308 --> 38:19.369
My point is, in a couple of days
even if you do figure this out

38:19.411 --> 38:24.118
they would have aged years beyond
the age they were when they die

38:24.216 --> 38:26.293
How are you going to explain that?

38:28.989 --> 38:31.741
How are you not freaking
out right now, William?

38:31.839 --> 38:33.881
- I'm trying to think
- Okay, good

38:33.921 --> 38:35.778
Yeah, sure. You think. I'll think too

38:35.812 --> 38:38.629
I'll think about what's it like in jail

38:38.662 --> 38:43.271
Or when Bionyne sues us for $30b

38:43.275 --> 38:44.421
What are you doing?

38:48.175 --> 38:51.113
I'll sedate them. Induce a coma

38:51.123 --> 38:53.875
That will keep their minds in a blank state

38:54.806 --> 38:56.717
Till I figure it out

38:56.760 --> 38:58.649
What if you don't figure it out?

38:58.650 --> 39:01.588
You can't keeping them sedated
for more than 72 hours tops

39:01.597 --> 39:05.376
After that you going to have
to make a very tough decision

39:06.530 --> 39:08.354
Drain the pod

39:31.970 --> 39:32.427
Got her?

39:53.075 --> 39:53.875
Holy shit.

39:55.938 --> 39:57.238
I did it!
We did it.

39:58.784 --> 39:59.984
She's perfect man.

40:02.447 --> 40:04.847
It's better than successful
man this is perfect.

40:05.400 --> 40:06.200
Shit.

40:10.811 --> 40:11.811
Okay.

40:13.413 --> 40:19.169
This should keep their bodies fed for a
while and I'll drop somemore off tomorrow

40:20.566 --> 40:21.526
Thank you

40:23.062 --> 40:24.022
You got it

40:29.494 --> 40:31.414
You got 3 days man

40:33.430 --> 40:34.294
Yeah

40:35.542 --> 40:36.748
I'll see you tomorrow

40:39.382 --> 40:40.204
Yeah

40:40.342 --> 40:42.508
Hey we made clones today

40:43.894 --> 40:45.772
You can add that to your resume

43:09.277 --> 43:12.094
I thought I can do it

43:17.830 --> 43:20.549
Sorry

43:39.804 --> 43:42.774
- What?
- Bill, have you been avoiding my call?

43:43.615 --> 43:48.442
- Bill?
- What?

43:48.484 --> 43:52.318
Do you realize how much money has
been invested in this project?

43:53.385 --> 43:57.388
People are counting on you.
I'm counting on you - Shit

43:57.389 --> 44:00.802
- And we almost out of time
- Holy shit

44:00.803 --> 44:01.929
What did you say?

44:03.059 --> 44:04.948
Do you hear me?

44:05.602 --> 44:06.863
Bill, are you still there?

44:17.122 --> 44:18.428
We've been looking in the wrong place

44:18.434 --> 44:20.962
You're really close to me, man

44:20.963 --> 44:22.979
It's not the mind, it's not the brain, Ed

44:23.014 --> 44:24.904
- It's the body
- The body?

44:24.936 --> 44:29.281
It's so obvious, so elegant, so simple

44:29.410 --> 44:32.908
Hey man, let's pump the brakes
on the crazy train, alright?

44:33.649 --> 44:36.402
Follow me, Edward

44:49.089 --> 44:52.835
Dead flat. Watch this

44:57.769 --> 45:01.450
Her mind is a blank slate. Comatose.

45:01.486 --> 45:03.462
She's never experienced a
moment of consciousness

45:03.503 --> 45:06.256
Yet, she's breathing. Her heart's pumping

45:06.290 --> 45:09.293
But that is not a sign of consciousness.
Those are involuntary functions.

45:09.333 --> 45:11.157
All controlled in the brain

45:11.191 --> 45:13.911
Her brain knows that it has a body

45:13.914 --> 45:17.714
This specific body.
That's what I was missing

45:17.758 --> 45:19.669
That's why 345 doesn't work

45:19.711 --> 45:22.714
It has electrodes and wirings
connected to steel and titanium

45:22.723 --> 45:26.436
We're imprinting a biological
brain into a synthetic mind

45:26.470 --> 45:28.327
But it is doesn't know that

45:28.328 --> 45:30.403
It's looking for its body,
its heart, its lungs

45:30.410 --> 45:32.267
but it can't find them

45:32.300 --> 45:35.150
So the lower reptilian brain freaks out

45:35.151 --> 45:37.936
It thinks that it is
dying, reacts accordingly

45:37.969 --> 45:40.754
and never has a chance
to reach consciousness

45:40.756 --> 45:41.870
Oh shit, yeah

45:41.909 --> 45:43.821
It's like transplant rejection

45:44.664 --> 45:46.521
We just have to trick the synthetic mind

45:46.522 --> 45:50.552
believe that it has its biological
actual flesh and blood body

45:50.558 --> 45:54.336
- That's the solution
- That maybe is 345 solution

45:54.370 --> 45:56.194
but what does this has
to do with your family?

45:56.228 --> 46:00.028
- They are not robots
- It has everything to do with my family

46:00.167 --> 46:06.732
I will imprinting her
mind into her own body

46:07.727 --> 46:11.441
- I know it's going to work
- But are you sure?

46:11.475 --> 46:13.452
I mean we'll only going
to get one shot at this

46:14.454 --> 46:17.304
Standby to initiate the neural imprint, Ed

46:28.708 --> 46:31.745
- Ready?
- Is that ever matter?

46:36.588 --> 46:39.308
Initiate the neural imprint

46:39.439 --> 46:42.159
Commence Bio to Bio protocol

46:54.846 --> 46:58.679
Keep an eye on Mona's sensory cortex. Good

47:03.486 --> 47:04.439
Going temporal

47:05.406 --> 47:06.359
Parietal

47:08.002 --> 47:09.239
Limbic

47:10.254 --> 47:13.039
- Vitals?
- Vitals are good

47:13.040 --> 47:14.897
Okay

47:15.026 --> 47:19.766
This stays good. All functions good

47:23.675 --> 47:25.619
Initiating neural imprint

47:29.345 --> 47:31.234
Incredible

47:35.239 --> 47:37.096
Imprint completed

47:57.213 --> 48:00.085
What's going on, man? Nothing's happening

48:00.992 --> 48:03.842
Can you hear me, Mona?

48:11.531 --> 48:15.528
Shit, she's rejecting it. Oh shit, man.
What are we gonna do?

48:15.567 --> 48:17.357
Wait!

48:37.413 --> 48:39.487
William?

48:42.250 --> 48:44.107
Baby

48:51.956 --> 48:55.636
- William, what are you doing?
- Putting her to sleep

48:55.639 --> 48:56.801
I can't have her and the kids wake up

48:56.824 --> 49:00.657
- to the house like this
- Yeah, good thinking

49:01.469 --> 49:03.544
Do you have any idea what we've just did?

49:03.550 --> 49:08.192
I mean this is the single greatest
thing that I have ever done in my life

49:08.196 --> 49:10.173
You. Anyone has ever done. I mean

49:10.214 --> 49:12.900
We can't tell anyone about it, but

49:12.936 --> 49:14.017
Oh god.

49:14.082 --> 49:14.829
I mean

49:15.851 --> 49:18.028
We're talking Nobel Prize, right?

49:18.562 --> 49:22.188
Foster-Whittle. Scratch that. Whittle-Foster.
Don't have to be alphabetical

49:35.007 --> 49:38.010
Well, I hope they going to be okay

49:38.851 --> 49:41.723
- We did it
- Yeah

49:48.460 --> 49:53.222
Alright, I'll see you at work

52:44.123 --> 52:46.067
Mona?

52:52.004 --> 52:54.624
Kids?

53:05.201 --> 53:07.374
- Morning, William
- Morning

53:08.211 --> 53:11.084
- So, how is everybody?
- I'm hungry

53:11.126 --> 53:14.872
- Starve
- I feel great. I'm going for a run

53:14.874 --> 53:18.674
- Outside?
- You looked tired. Did you sleep okay?

53:18.718 --> 53:19.733
Yeah

53:21.633 --> 53:25.434
- Have a good run
- Dad!

53:25.509 --> 53:29.441
- Can I have some pancakes?
- Yes

53:29.481 --> 53:33.096
Yes, you can have some pancakes, Matthew

53:35.054 --> 53:39.761
- Sophie, you want some pancakes too?
- Yeah

53:39.763 --> 53:42.635
Great!

53:56.109 --> 53:57.601
Hey, can I have a French toast?

53:57.708 --> 54:00.871
Oui, French toast for the lady

54:00.872 --> 54:01.986
Coming up

54:27.971 --> 54:29.860
Gross

54:29.861 --> 54:31.838
Mom, this milk gone sour.
Did you go shopping?

54:31.846 --> 54:33.758
- I just bought this the other day
- It's curdled

54:34.633 --> 54:36.545
Sold us expired milk

54:36.642 --> 54:37.602
Yeah

54:37.612 --> 54:41.228
Somebody's going to need a piece
of my mind. I'll take care of it

54:44.332 --> 54:45.260
Work

54:45.922 --> 54:47.180
I gotta..

54:48.514 --> 54:49.335
Okay

54:53.853 --> 54:55.742
- Yeah
- Hey, it's me

54:55.774 --> 54:57.686
We got a donor inbound. 37 minutes

54:57.729 --> 55:00.578
- You got to meet me at the lab asap
- My family just woke up

55:00.579 --> 55:02.988
Congratulations, but it's gonna
be a pretty short reunion

55:02.998 --> 55:04.318
unless we solve 345

55:04.360 --> 55:06.369
If we get shut down we get exposed

55:06.409 --> 55:09.282
- Matt, careful
- Are you listening to me?

55:09.324 --> 55:12.076
William, you hearing me?

55:12.976 --> 55:15.913
- Hello?
- Yeah, okay. I'll be there

55:15.955 --> 55:17.680
Goddammit!

55:19.639 --> 55:21.496
Buddy, you're okay?

55:21.528 --> 55:23.505
Yeah, I'm fine

55:23.611 --> 55:26.330
Are you alright?

55:26.366 --> 55:29.271
You don't seemed like yourself today

55:29.280 --> 55:33.213
- I have to go to the lab
- You take off, baby, we're good

55:35.078 --> 55:37.087
I hate to leave you on a Saturday

55:37.128 --> 55:39.782
We'll still be here when you get back

55:39.883 --> 55:41.772
Okay

55:58.205 --> 56:02.006
Neural tissue intact. Protoplasmic
integrity approximately 60%

56:03.010 --> 56:04.768
I make it 55%

56:04.804 --> 56:06.911
Still, cortex is viable. Do you concur?

56:13.581 --> 56:15.470
William?

56:16.239 --> 56:17.320
Negative

56:19.282 --> 56:21.193
It's too corrupt

56:27.931 --> 56:30.868
What's going on, man? Donor was good

56:30.878 --> 56:33.531
I couldn't do it

56:33.569 --> 56:36.506
I couldn't put another person through that

56:36.516 --> 56:39.519
Well, you've picked hell of
a time to grow a conscience

56:39.526 --> 56:43.360
I hope you're ready to go
to jail with your family

56:43.370 --> 56:47.979
Because that's what going to
happen if we don't get 345 to work

56:47.983 --> 56:51.020
So, you better figure something out. Soon

58:18.378 --> 58:21.130
Are you in there, Bill?

58:22.958 --> 58:27.021
- Yeah, it's me
- Everything okay in there?

58:27.058 --> 58:31.667
- All good
- Damn shame about donor today, huh?

58:33.593 --> 58:35.569
We'll get the next one, Sir

58:35.578 --> 58:38.396
I hope there is next one, Bill

59:17.860 --> 59:19.717
Oh my god, shit

59:20.680 --> 59:23.617
- Mom, have you seen my cell phone?
- No I've been looking for mine too

59:23.659 --> 59:26.345
Well, your whole social
life doesn't depend on it

59:26.381 --> 59:28.456
Mine does - Okay, okay, so
where did you have it last?

59:28.463 --> 59:30.156
I have no idea

59:30.193 --> 59:33.098
- Troll, did you take my cell phone?
- No

59:33.108 --> 59:34.156
Oh my god

59:48.644 --> 59:50.500
Ed!

59:54.281 --> 59:57.033
Jesus, are you crying blood?

59:57.997 --> 01:00:00.104
William, you didn't-

01:00:00.142 --> 01:00:02.993
- I did
- On yourself? Are you out of your mind?

01:00:02.994 --> 01:00:05.601
Have you considered the very real the
possibility that you've gone completely

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.797
insane? It could kill you

01:00:07.798 --> 01:00:09.589
Ed, I had to. Listen

01:00:09.593 --> 01:00:12.596
I'm going to upload my neural map into 345

01:00:12.635 --> 01:00:15.485
- And it's going to be me in there
- Sure

01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:18.238
- That makes me-
- Edward. William. -Hey, Phil

01:00:22.053 --> 01:00:24.029
We'll start with a scan of my body

01:00:24.039 --> 01:00:26.791
I take that data, create an
algorithm which will bridge

01:00:26.826 --> 01:00:28.966
with my neural imprint in 345

01:00:28.971 --> 01:00:32.750
Okay, so you write an
algorithm that tricks the

01:00:32.752 --> 01:00:36.432
synthetic brain into thinking that
its real actual body is there?

01:00:36.467 --> 01:00:38.378
Exactly

01:00:38.422 --> 01:00:41.392
And with my mind inside, we'll
be able to verify that the

01:00:41.432 --> 01:00:45.081
synthetic brain has reached
consciousness because

01:00:45.085 --> 01:00:48.022
I will be able to ask myself

01:00:48.063 --> 01:00:51.000
I'm the base line, Ed, I'm the control

01:00:51.010 --> 01:00:54.789
It will be me

01:00:55.846 --> 01:00:58.631
I'll start writing the algorithm tonight

01:00:58.633 --> 01:01:02.467
Okay, so we still going to
tree shopping tomorrow?

01:01:17.788 --> 01:01:21.118
- Something's wrong
- What's wrong?

01:01:21.248 --> 01:01:23.467
I don't know, William, but
something's not right with me

01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:25.499
I don't remember what I
had for dinner last night

01:01:25.509 --> 01:01:27.518
I don't remember leaving the
clinic for Christmas break

01:01:27.526 --> 01:01:29.252
Didn't we go on a boat trip?

01:01:29.288 --> 01:01:31.187
I don't remember going
on a boat trip, William

01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:33.285
- Something is not right with me
- Oh baby

01:01:36.911 --> 01:01:39.948
- Where are the kids?
- Asleep

01:01:40.755 --> 01:01:43.758
Sophie has a fever but she's okay

01:01:44.663 --> 01:01:47.448
Maybe you have what Sophie has

01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:49.394
Maybe

01:01:50.461 --> 01:01:54.508
Why don't you go and lie down?
See how you feel in the morning.

01:01:54.615 --> 01:01:56.065
Yeah

01:01:58.213 --> 01:02:00.866
I'm exhausted

01:02:25.952 --> 01:02:28.857
Support directive 2.5

01:02:33.248 --> 01:02:36.321
Cytokine 45 NX 1.7

01:02:37.548 --> 01:02:41.294
Suppress directive

01:03:11.214 --> 01:03:13.835
Mum! Mum!

01:03:13.904 --> 01:03:15.913
- Dad!
- Sophie!

01:03:15.955 --> 01:03:18.641
- Mum! Is Mom dead?
- What?

01:03:18.646 --> 01:03:23.669
- I saw it, Daddy
- No it's just a bad dream

01:03:23.707 --> 01:03:27.453
- Mummy's okay
- I saw her die

01:03:27.486 --> 01:03:31.287
No. Everything's going to be alright

01:03:31.297 --> 01:03:34.202
- Go back to sleep
- It felt so real

01:03:34.213 --> 01:03:35.905
It's just a dream, mummy's okay

01:03:35.943 --> 01:03:38.815
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, it's okay

01:03:39.787 --> 01:03:41.698
It's just a bad dream

01:03:41.709 --> 01:03:44.559
- Okay
- Yeah, mummy's all good

01:04:34.529 --> 01:04:36.505
Better now

01:04:36.515 --> 01:04:38.524
All better

01:04:38.533 --> 01:04:41.383
It will be like it never happened

01:04:41.384 --> 01:04:44.322
William, what's going on?

01:04:49.007 --> 01:04:52.721
- Mona, can we go upstairs?
- What have you done to Sophie?

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:55.670
- I gave her a little sedative
- You did what?

01:04:55.702 --> 01:04:56.816
- She's okay
- What?

01:04:56.823 --> 01:05:00.503
- Mona, please, let's talk upstairs
- No, William

01:05:00.539 --> 01:05:02.516
Tell me the truth

01:05:10.053 --> 01:05:12.925
There was a crash

01:05:12.935 --> 01:05:15.043
You and the kids died

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:18.795
I brought you back

01:05:20.815 --> 01:05:23.535
You're replicants

01:05:29.368 --> 01:05:34.195
Get that thing off her head

01:05:58.132 --> 01:06:00.917
I'm dead?

01:06:01.111 --> 01:06:05.687
You're alive, you are you

01:06:05.724 --> 01:06:07.766
Matt is alive upstairs

01:06:07.806 --> 01:06:10.591
Sophie and

01:06:11.682 --> 01:06:14.532
And no one has to know

01:06:18.312 --> 01:06:21.065
How could you do this?

01:06:21.068 --> 01:06:24.070
I watched our children die

01:06:25.937 --> 01:06:29.902
I held your lifeless body
in my arms and I thought

01:06:31.734 --> 01:06:34.552
I could bring you back

01:06:35.514 --> 01:06:38.419
What would you have done?

01:07:22.369 --> 01:07:25.154
- How're you doing?
- Very good -What's up?

01:07:26.245 --> 01:07:28.287
- Morning
- Morning

01:07:29.288 --> 01:07:32.936
- Hi, Ed. How are you?
- Good, how are you?

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:33.956
Great

01:07:34.093 --> 01:07:37.806
- Hey Matty, come stay here with me
- But I like this one

01:07:37.809 --> 01:07:39.698
No, I hate those were fake

01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:44.494
I think they're nice

01:07:45.593 --> 01:07:48.246
Come, let's look over here

01:07:52.287 --> 01:07:56.065
So you got them back

01:07:58.053 --> 01:07:59.964
Yeah

01:08:00.775 --> 01:08:03.560
Okay, let's get your tree

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:19.344
Maybe we should move back home

01:08:19.354 --> 01:08:21.495
- What?
- We've just settled here

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.157
Are you serious, Dad?

01:08:23.198 --> 01:08:26.015
- Matt, you missed your plate
- Idiot

01:08:26.015 --> 01:08:27.742
What?

01:08:32.807 --> 01:08:35.591
Hey Dad, who is Zoe?

01:08:37.452 --> 01:08:38.412
Who?

01:08:38.444 --> 01:08:41.317
Someone scribbled Zoe in
my closet with a crayon

01:08:41.327 --> 01:08:44.298
- There was a bunk bed in that bedroom
- A bunk bed?

01:08:44.307 --> 01:08:46.197
- Are you sure?
- I'm not crazy

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:50.095
- I remember photos in the upstairs hallway
- Honey, that thing that happened

01:08:50.104 --> 01:08:52.857
There might be some things

01:08:52.892 --> 01:08:55.796
And I remember what you
looked like when you're lying

01:09:04.359 --> 01:09:06.335
Merry Christmas, Bill

01:09:06.345 --> 01:09:09.194
Is that lamb that I smell?

01:09:09.292 --> 01:09:12.077
I'm interrupting dinner, aren't I?

01:09:12.078 --> 01:09:16.840
- Mona, you look stunning
- I miss you, Jones

01:09:16.883 --> 01:09:18.794
Such a lucky man, Bill

01:09:18.837 --> 01:09:21.742
What an unexpected pleasure.
Do you care to join us?

01:09:21.785 --> 01:09:23.696
Beautiful and generous

01:09:23.707 --> 01:09:26.393
I've heard about women like you. Thanks

01:09:26.397 --> 01:09:28.286
But I wouldn't dream of imposing

01:09:28.287 --> 01:09:30.143
William, can I have a quick word?

01:09:30.176 --> 01:09:32.185
Promise I'll have him back in 5 minutes

01:09:35.174 --> 01:09:37.085
We're not done

01:09:47.442 --> 01:09:50.511
- What brings you by?
- Let me ask you something

01:09:50.517 --> 01:09:54.229
Didn't you ever think this
is all a little too easy?

01:09:58.269 --> 01:10:00.889
I don't know what you're talking about

01:10:00.928 --> 01:10:02.107
Let me help

01:10:02.112 --> 01:10:08.643
Subject 346, 347, 348
Bionyne property, Bill

01:10:08.679 --> 01:10:11.464
Desperation has driven many great men

01:10:11.498 --> 01:10:12.645
to accomplish the impossible

01:10:12.651 --> 01:10:14.344
Fate caused that car crash

01:10:14.381 --> 01:10:16.293
I just let things play out

01:10:16.303 --> 01:10:19.340
Colour me impressed but
now I have a problem

01:10:19.345 --> 01:10:21.289
3, actually

01:10:22.228 --> 01:10:26.007
Do you know what would happen
if word of this ever got out?

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.984
Nobody has to know

01:10:27.994 --> 01:10:30.714
- Nobody will ever know
- Mona knows

01:10:30.718 --> 01:10:32.792
How long until Sophie and
Matt start asking questions?

01:10:32.799 --> 01:10:34.589
Maybe their friends will

01:10:34.625 --> 01:10:35.706
Lies are messy

01:10:35.714 --> 01:10:38.467
I'm not in a business of messy it's risky

01:10:38.469 --> 01:10:40.293
Simple is safe

01:10:41.416 --> 01:10:47.018
Those 3 subjects in the wild
is something I cannot tolerate

01:10:48.046 --> 01:10:50.056
I know how to make 345 work

01:10:50.064 --> 01:10:51.855
That's worth something

01:10:51.859 --> 01:10:55.725
Bionyne will be the most successful
biomedical company in the world

01:10:55.766 --> 01:10:58.486
William, ask yourself a question

01:10:58.617 --> 01:11:00.322
Who would spend this much money saving

01:11:00.323 --> 01:11:02.484
mortally wounded soldiers?

01:11:02.493 --> 01:11:05.398
Man, come on

01:11:05.408 --> 01:11:07.352
That's not how you win wars

01:11:07.393 --> 01:11:13.095
- We're not a biomedical company?
- My name isn't even Jones

01:11:13.096 --> 01:11:15.946
Now you figure out how to transfer

01:11:15.979 --> 01:11:18.731
human consciousness into a machine

01:11:18.733 --> 01:11:21.736
Imagine that the best pilot put
into a thousand individual drones

01:11:21.776 --> 01:11:25.522
The mind of a hacker loaded into the virus

01:11:25.524 --> 01:11:28.396
Do you have any idea how much that's worth?

01:11:28.407 --> 01:11:31.279
Bill, isn't that exciting?

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:33.112
What about my family?

01:11:33.116 --> 01:11:36.053
Your family died in a car accident, Bill

01:11:36.094 --> 01:11:39.032
The algorithm. Get me the algorithm

01:11:39.073 --> 01:11:42.946
And then finish dinner.
Kiss the kids good night

01:11:43.522 --> 01:11:50.532
Hell. Make love to your wife. Have
what you didn't have the first time

01:11:50.573 --> 01:11:55.150
A chance to say goodbye

01:11:56.147 --> 01:11:58.222
That is my gift to you

01:12:05.853 --> 01:12:08.670
I'll get the algorithm

01:12:48.006 --> 01:12:51.752
You see, knew you were smart
enough to do the right thing

01:13:02.421 --> 01:13:05.271
This is going to piss me off, isn't it?

01:13:23.266 --> 01:13:25.475
William, you are scaring the kids

01:13:25.516 --> 01:13:27.428
- Where's Mr. Jones?
- Mum. Dad.

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:30.287
- Are you guys getting a divorce?
- Maybe -No

01:13:30.321 --> 01:13:32.232
Can you go to your rooms, please?

01:13:32.339 --> 01:13:35.059
- Where's the tin foil?
- On top of the dishwasher

01:13:40.955 --> 01:13:43.740
William, I need to know what's going on

01:13:44.607 --> 01:13:46.616
And who is Zoe?

01:13:47.618 --> 01:13:50.491
Zoe is our daughter

01:13:51.334 --> 01:13:53.343
I couldn't bring you all back

01:13:53.384 --> 01:13:55.174
I couldn't save you all

01:13:55.209 --> 01:13:57.251
There weren't enough pods

01:13:58.189 --> 01:14:01.804
I deleted her from your memories

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.947
You took the memory of my child from me?

01:14:05.748 --> 01:14:07.637
I'm sorry

01:14:07.638 --> 01:14:08.768
And I don't blame me if you want to hate me

01:14:08.791 --> 01:14:13.433
for the rest of my life,
but now we have to go

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:16.438
Bionyne isn't a medical company

01:14:16.479 --> 01:14:18.934
I don't even know what they are

01:14:18.945 --> 01:14:22.107
But they going to kill you and the kids

01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:24.802
unless we go right now

01:14:24.803 --> 01:14:27.969
And I didn't defy every
natural law there is

01:14:27.979 --> 01:14:30.731
just to lose you again

01:14:30.765 --> 01:14:34.510
We have to go

01:14:35.634 --> 01:14:37.578
Kids, we're leaving!

01:15:11.125 --> 01:15:13.014
Come on!

01:15:40.915 --> 01:15:42.771
What is going on?

01:15:42.773 --> 01:15:47.535
Matt, Sophie, there are bad
people trying to hurt us

01:15:47.578 --> 01:15:49.620
Just hold on and everything will be alright

01:15:50.461 --> 01:15:53.333
We go to Ed's boat and get out of here

01:16:13.524 --> 01:16:18.351
I'm disappointed, Bill. Very disappointed

01:16:20.699 --> 01:16:22.902
Sir, they're on the move

01:16:24.703 --> 01:16:26.560
Don't shoot them in the head

01:16:27.490 --> 01:16:29.499
- It's all your fault
- I didn't do anything

01:16:33.448 --> 01:16:34.689
How did they find us?

01:16:34.774 --> 01:16:36.642
Don't you guys watch TV? I bet you
they tracked Sophie's cell phone

01:16:36.705 --> 01:16:37.707
No they didn't, shut up

01:16:40.975 --> 01:16:43.793
Shit, maybe it's in the
car, maybe it's the GPS

01:16:43.795 --> 01:16:45.804
It's not the car, it's not the phones

01:16:45.813 --> 01:16:49.591
Bionyne puts the tracking markers
on all of the experimental animals

01:16:49.624 --> 01:16:51.535
The trackers are in you

01:17:01.124 --> 01:17:04.061
- William!
- Dad!

01:17:12.526 --> 01:17:15.377
We're okay, it's alright

01:17:15.378 --> 01:17:16.568
- You're okay?
- We're alight

01:17:18.517 --> 01:17:20.341
How do we get the trackers out?

01:17:21.304 --> 01:17:24.241
They're in the pods and they
attach to the spine in uteral

01:17:24.251 --> 01:17:28.030
They're powered by the central
nervous system. They don't come out

01:17:28.062 --> 01:17:29.335
What are you guys talking about?

01:17:29.336 --> 01:17:32.251
- Drive to the clinic
- That's about the way we came

01:17:32.387 --> 01:17:34.145
Drive to the clinic

01:17:35.398 --> 01:17:36.324
Okay

01:18:03.297 --> 01:18:05.388
- Sophie, I need you to lie down
- What do you mean?

01:18:05.494 --> 01:18:09.028
- Dad why?
- It's ok, get on the table

01:18:09.063 --> 01:18:09.991
- It's alright
- What?

01:18:09.992 --> 01:18:12.777
The tracker's powered by the nervous
system so this will fry them

01:18:12.779 --> 01:18:15.684
- Red, white, black
- Trackers? What are you saying?

01:18:15.725 --> 01:18:18.754
- It's okay, Sophie, it's okay
- Mum, what's going on I'm serious?

01:18:18.849 --> 01:18:20.398
Somebody put something bad in us

01:18:20.434 --> 01:18:21.646
and I'm trying to kill it

01:18:21.651 --> 01:18:24.404
I know you're afraid but you just going
to have to try and relax and trust me

01:18:24.438 --> 01:18:26.196
It's going to be okay

01:18:35.041 --> 01:18:36.766
Mona

01:18:36.803 --> 01:18:38.691
If I get this wrong it'll stop her heart

01:18:38.692 --> 01:18:39.871
What!? Mum!

01:18:41.543 --> 01:18:43.618
This should be it. Inside the hospital

01:18:44.394 --> 01:18:45.670
Clear!

01:18:47.501 --> 01:18:49.413
Shit, let's go

01:19:00.058 --> 01:19:02.778
It's okay, Matty, it's not
as bad as it seems okay

01:19:03.742 --> 01:19:04.702
Clear!

01:19:08.515 --> 01:19:11.485
- There goes another one
- They gotta be upstairs

01:19:11.494 --> 01:19:14.180
Hey! Hey!

01:19:14.216 --> 01:19:15.362
What are you doing here?

01:19:20.014 --> 01:19:21.870
Dad, hurry up

01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:28.849
Baby, try to calm down

01:19:31.674 --> 01:19:33.498
Straight ahead on the left

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.515
Here

01:19:34.557 --> 01:19:36.347
Dad, someone's coming

01:19:39.201 --> 01:19:40.315
Damn it

01:19:41.315 --> 01:19:42.275
Now

01:20:01.687 --> 01:20:03.604
They were right here

01:20:10.079 --> 01:20:12.799
Targets are off the axis
they fried their tracers

01:20:12.835 --> 01:20:13.948
We lost them

01:20:18.728 --> 01:20:21.513
It's Jones, I have a question for you

01:20:28.210 --> 01:20:30.099
You and the kids stay in the car

01:20:30.132 --> 01:20:32.021
I want to make sure it's safe

01:20:32.022 --> 01:20:34.031
I'll see if I can get the boat

01:21:19.629 --> 01:21:20.695
Bait box

01:21:21.031 --> 01:21:23.903
- When is Dad coming back?
- Honey, stay quiet

01:21:24.779 --> 01:21:26.723
The keys are in the bait box

01:21:33.419 --> 01:21:35.363
You said the keys are in the bait box

01:21:44.222 --> 01:21:48.022
- Mom!
- Let go of me! Mom!

01:21:49.764 --> 01:21:51.871
Matt! Mom!

01:21:51.878 --> 01:21:54.564
Let go of my kids!

01:21:55.626 --> 01:21:57.537
Let go of my kids!

01:21:57.611 --> 01:21:59.500
Dad, look out!

01:21:59.533 --> 01:22:01.225
Dad!

01:22:02.416 --> 01:22:04.076
- William!
- Dad!

01:22:08.054 --> 01:22:10.871
We have the wife and kids.
What about Foster?

01:22:10.905 --> 01:22:12.849
He will come to us

01:22:35.857 --> 01:22:38.675
Good call, Eddy, here're your boat keys

01:22:42.648 --> 01:22:44.625
- You bastard
- Mona, look

01:22:44.748 --> 01:22:47.734
Everything's going to be fine
if William just cooperates

01:22:47.841 --> 01:22:48.375
Fine?

01:22:48.481 --> 01:22:52.126
- You idiot. They gonna kill us, Ed
- Mom? What are you talking about?

01:22:52.162 --> 01:22:54.980
You know what, I've some snacks
in my office. Take the kids there

01:22:54.981 --> 01:22:56.990
Mom! Come with us

01:23:10.388 --> 01:23:11.188
Foster's here.

01:23:11.924 --> 01:23:12.916
Yes, sir

01:23:15.993 --> 01:23:21.086
Look Mona, we stole millions of dollars
worth of Bionyne equipment to make you

01:23:21.118 --> 01:23:22.876
- Make me?
- Yes, make you

01:23:22.913 --> 01:23:24.857
To bring you back. You died, remember?

01:23:24.866 --> 01:23:27.739
I was supposed to get rid of the bodies.
Your bodies

01:23:27.782 --> 01:23:30.534
I couldn't do it and then Jones found out

01:23:30.536 --> 01:23:33.814
Look, if we just play ball,
we can make it out of this

01:23:34.083 --> 01:23:35.500
Get your hands off my wife!

01:23:39.216 --> 01:23:41.324
- Where're the kids?
- They're okay, they're over there

01:23:42.068 --> 01:23:45.441
William, I'm sorry. This
wasn't supposed to happen

01:23:45.443 --> 01:23:47.799
- this got way out of hand
- It's alright

01:23:47.833 --> 01:23:49.908
It's going to be okay

01:23:50.685 --> 01:23:53.687
- I destroyed the algorithm
- I noticed that

01:23:53.728 --> 01:23:56.961
The only place that algorithm
exists is in my head

01:23:57.475 --> 01:23:59.331
You want it, we walk out of here

01:23:59.365 --> 01:24:00.367
You will never see us again

01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:03.468
Me and my family disappear
Bill, are you negotiating?

01:24:05.546 --> 01:24:06.946
You need me

01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:08.806
Maybe

01:24:10.319 --> 01:24:11.849
But I don't need her

01:24:11.855 --> 01:24:13.097
Jones, wait!

01:24:19.481 --> 01:24:21.370
Or him

01:24:21.403 --> 01:24:24.373
Wait, no! I'll do it! I'll do it!

01:24:24.382 --> 01:24:27.166
I'll give you the algorithm

01:24:27.201 --> 01:24:29.276
I know

01:24:39.694 --> 01:24:41.703
If you trust him, he'll kill us

01:24:42.704 --> 01:24:45.456
I love you

01:26:30.108 --> 01:26:32.893
- The algorithm
- It's all there?

01:26:32.926 --> 01:26:34.007
It's all there

01:26:34.048 --> 01:26:36.898
Now let my family go

01:26:37.027 --> 01:26:38.938
Why are you stuck on that?

01:26:38.949 --> 01:26:41.704
This thing

01:26:42.789 --> 01:26:44.584
It's a copy

01:26:44.586 --> 01:26:46.497
I mean, you really don't get it?

01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:48.452
The experiment's over, Bill

01:26:48.494 --> 01:26:50.318
No, it isn't

01:26:52.273 --> 01:26:54.130
Jones

01:26:54.132 --> 01:26:57.070
I'm here for my family

01:27:09.379 --> 01:27:10.569
The kids! Let's get the kids

01:27:49.099 --> 01:27:51.010
Go

01:27:55.024 --> 01:27:58.418
Mom what is he doing? Where is he going?

01:27:59.316 --> 01:28:01.239
He's going to get something, Honey

01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:04.642
He's going to get something

01:28:09.632 --> 01:28:10.531
William!

01:28:11.072 --> 01:28:12.259
William!

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.371
That's enough

01:28:26.704 --> 01:28:29.135
What's it feel like?

01:28:34.904 --> 01:28:37.754
This is going to sound strange

01:28:37.755 --> 01:28:39.192
But it feels

01:28:39.771 --> 01:28:40.824
like me

01:28:47.365 --> 01:28:49.309
Bill

01:28:56.078 --> 01:28:58.950
I'll die they'll send
somebody else after I'm gone

01:28:58.992 --> 01:29:01.897
Sooner or later they'll find you

01:29:01.907 --> 01:29:04.757
Not if we work together

01:29:05.078 --> 01:29:07.351
Bill, are you negotiating?

01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:13.310
What if I told you there
is another way, Jones?

01:29:14.176 --> 01:29:16.349
Give us what we want

01:29:16.386 --> 01:29:18.435
and you can live again

01:29:18.690 --> 01:29:21.027
as a very rich man

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:24.773
What do you say?

01:29:24.778 --> 01:29:26.853
Do we have a deal?

01:29:28.686 --> 01:29:31.471
See you soon, Bill

01:29:38.551 --> 01:29:40.434
I'll handle it from here, William

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:42.066
Are you sure?

01:29:42.171 --> 01:29:44.607
You'll have to stay behind

01:29:45.435 --> 01:29:46.911
There is no other way

01:29:46.912 --> 01:29:49.762
You take care of the family

01:29:51.653 --> 01:29:53.728
We'll be fine

01:30:16.670 --> 01:30:18.744
Ed

01:31:23.809 --> 01:31:25.786
Mummy!

01:31:27.685 --> 01:31:29.574
Zoe

01:31:55.584 --> 01:31:59.418
Mr. Kisam, I am so glad you could make it

01:32:01.446 --> 01:32:03.358
Trust me, you won't regret it

01:32:03.401 --> 01:32:06.186
Because I ask you, what price can you

01:32:06.188 --> 01:32:08.197
put on a second lifetime?

01:32:09.006 --> 01:32:10.983
Please

01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:27.320
Well Bill, it's time to go to work

01:32:33.927 --> 01:32:36.712
