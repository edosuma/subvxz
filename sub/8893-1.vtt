00:12.646 --> 00:15.171
I wear a disguise,
I'm just your average Jane

00:15.249 --> 00:19.276
The super doesn't stand for model
but that doesn't mean I'm plain

00:19.353 --> 00:22.845
If all you see is how I look,
you miss the super chick within

00:22.923 --> 00:26.825
And I christen you ''Titanic, ''
underestimate and swim

00:28.695 --> 00:34.292
And I'm a one-girl revolution
I'm a one-girl revolution

(girl) Hey, I have always known there are
some stories that have to be told,

00:39.172 --> 00:42.630
but I never realized
my memoirs would be one of them.

00:42.709 --> 00:47.544
...that I wanna be
I am confidence and insecurity

00:47.614 --> 00:51.050
I am a voice yet waiting to be heard

00:51.118 --> 00:55.612
I'll shoot the shot bang
that you hear round the world

00:55.689 --> 00:58.351
(all cheer)

00:58.425 --> 01:00.052

You know. I've decided to show the worId

Divorced, alone,

He knows he has me, the light of his life.

03:48.829 --> 03:54.631
Ex-husband. ex-wife,

Forget about the fishbowI. honey,
The water damage wasn't that bad,

04:31.505 --> 04:34.065
And you know what? You managed
to save most of the fish,

04:34.141 --> 04:38.202
I saved them aII.
because every fish's Iife is sacred,

04:38.278 --> 04:41.406
Maybe if you sIow down just a IittIe bit,,,

04:42.015 --> 04:46.577
Mom. Dad said you can't think about art,
It's something you feeI and just do,

04:46.653 --> 04:50.487
WeII. your father is a grownup. sweetie,
Sometimes,

04:51.591 --> 04:57.257

05:46.379 --> 05:49.246
WouId it be wrong

05:50.083 --> 05:52.779
- It Iooks worse than it feeIs,
- Mom says she's in Iove,

05:52.853 --> 05:57.449

06:43.503 --> 06:45.300
and although he wasn't mushy,

06:45.372 --> 06:48.535
he looked at mom as if she were
the answer to his prayers.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.405

07:35.422 --> 07:39.256

09:33.073 --> 09:39.034
- So. what's he gonna do?
- Some things are gonna change. hon,

09:39.112 --> 09:43.048

A Iot? We can't move so far away

10:14.114 --> 10:16.480
They have a wonderfuI schooI

10:16.549 --> 10:19.040
But I Iove my schooI. Mom, I Iove it,

10:19.119 --> 10:22.384
This new schooI has very high standards,
The academics are great,

10:22.455 --> 10:25.390
How do you know.

A what?

10:40.373 --> 10:45.003
And it's a very caring. very structured

10:45.078 --> 10:47.672
miIitary schooI,

10:47.747 --> 10:50.910
MiIitary schooI? Uh. no. no,

10:50.984 --> 10:53.885
Like where they wear uniforms

10:53.953 --> 10:57.218
You can't do this to me. Mom,

How about if you two go and I stay here?
You can come and visit anytime you want,

11:07.133 --> 11:09.829
- I don't think so,
- What about if I move in with Amanda?

11:09.903 --> 11:11.165
Her parents won't even notice,

11:11.237 --> 11:13.102
KeIIy. you're much too much fun

11:13.173 --> 11:17.234
And you know what?
FamiIies don't Ieave anyone behind,

11:17.310 --> 11:20.040
Yeah. but,,,

I'm not going!

11:21.981 --> 11:24.313

And promise you won't Iike it more there
than you Iike it here,

11:30.056 --> 11:34.015
No chance of that,
They wear uniforms,

11:34.093 --> 11:38.427
They go to a schooI where they Iearn
about miIitary strategy, They sit in desks,

11:38.498 --> 11:40.227
(scoffing)

11:41.935 --> 11:43.459

11:44.337 --> 11:49.070

(cadets)  I don't know but I've been toId

12:30.416 --> 12:34.352

-  Streets in heaven are paved with goId

12:34.420 --> 12:37.548
(Kelly) Hello?

(cadets) One,,, two,,,

12:44.063 --> 12:46.224
three,,, four,,,

12:56.542 --> 12:59.773
I could not believe
that this was the man we married.

12:59.846 --> 13:01.711
Sir looked a whole lot different
standing there

13:01.781 --> 13:05.877
than when he was kissing my mother
in our living room.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.774
HeIIo, I'm CarIa,

13:37.850 --> 13:40.614
KeIIy, Nice to meet you,

13:40.687 --> 13:43.679
- You're gonna Iike it here. you know,
- I can't beIieve I have to sIeep in a pIace

13:43.756 --> 13:46.589
without a singIe decent piece of art
on the waIIs,

13:46.659 --> 13:51.926
Yuck, We got Captain Stone again,
You know. she's going to dismember us,

13:51.998 --> 13:54.330
Who's this Captain Stone anyway?

13:54.400 --> 13:57.767
Just the meanest 1 6-year-oId in America,
She's our squad Ieader,

13:57.837 --> 14:00.067
She's the one who teIIs us
what to do and when to do it,

14:00.139 --> 14:03.472
That can't be possibIe, We've got brains,
We are thinking peopIe,

14:03.543 --> 14:07.411
- Not around her. you're not,
- I hear she's got a buzzard for a pet,

14:07.480 --> 14:09.812
She's probabIy gonna be going
with Brad again this year,

14:09.882 --> 14:12.077
Brad? What's a Brad?

14:12.151 --> 14:15.643
He's the best-Iooking.
most perfect boy around,

14:15.722 --> 14:19.988
- And he goes to schooI here?
- Why not me?

14:22.161 --> 14:26.461
As if a cadet major wouId
be interested in any of you guys,

14:26.532 --> 14:29.023
(girl) Yeah. right,

14:35.274 --> 14:38.607
I wouIdn't do that if I were you,
It's not reguIation,

14:38.678 --> 14:41.613
It's just a bIanket,
It's not Iike anyone's gonna see it but us,

14:41.681 --> 14:44.775
- Everything here is by the book,
- Thanks for the warning. CarIa.

14:44.851 --> 14:48.309
but I'd reaIIy Iike to try and retain
my individuaIity around here,

14:48.388 --> 14:50.379
(girl) Ten-hut!

15:29.162 --> 15:33.895
I'm sorry, Did I accidentaIIy snatch
this ratty oId thing away from you?

15:33.966 --> 15:39.598
In my experience. peopIe don't snatch
accidentaIIy, And it's not ratty!

15:46.546 --> 15:50.209
It is now,
And keep it out of my barracks!

15:50.283 --> 15:53.081
Why wouId you do something Iike that?

15:53.920 --> 15:57.913
Oh! My bad,
You must be Captain Stone,

15:59.459 --> 16:04.260
Hmm, You're on my Iist,,, maggot,

16:07.166 --> 16:09.634
You'd be on mine if I had a Iist,

16:11.370 --> 16:14.305
I'II pretend that you didn't say that,

16:18.377 --> 16:20.368
As you were,

16:22.548 --> 16:24.641
Ooh! TroubIe ahead. girI,

16:24.717 --> 16:26.776
WeII. there'II be troubIe ahead for her. too,

16:26.853 --> 16:30.880
You don't get it, In her mind.
you're just a IowIy speck of dust,

16:30.957 --> 16:32.618
WeII. that's not how I see it. OK?

16:32.692 --> 16:36.492
We may be in miIitary schooI.
but we stiII Iive in a democracy,

16:36.562 --> 16:38.826
Some things are just gonna have
to change around here,

16:38.898 --> 16:41.924
You're gonna change a schooI
that's been around for a hundred years?

16:42.001 --> 16:45.562
I don't think so,
My advice - don't cross Jennifer,

16:52.778 --> 16:56.373
I hated it - the uniformity, the rules,

16:56.449 --> 16:58.474
the khaki of it all.

16:58.551 --> 17:02.385
It was totally clear to me
that George Washington Military Academy

17:02.455 --> 17:07.188
needed to become a kinder, gentler
school, and it was up to me to do it.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.954
I have to do everything.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.690
(female cadet) Lights out! Ten minutes!

17:11.763 --> 17:13.231
What?

17:13.299 --> 17:16.996
Excuse me,
My mom Iets me stay up tiII midnight!

17:18.637 --> 17:20.628
(drumroll)

17:21.406 --> 17:22.635
( ''Reveille'')

17:22.708 --> 17:25.905
(female cadet) Let's go. Iet's go!
Ladies. roII out of those racks!

17:25.978 --> 17:29.914
Inspection's at 0800 hours,
Let's go! Move!

17:29.982 --> 17:32.576
Come on! Out of those racks now!

17:43.563 --> 17:45.030
(mouthing)

17:50.603 --> 17:51.797
(mouthing)

18:05.151 --> 18:09.815
You wiII adhere to the foIIowing scheduIe,
Am I understood?

18:09.889 --> 18:11.754
Sir. yes. sir!

18:13.192 --> 18:16.719
ReveiIIe at 0600 hours!

18:16.796 --> 18:20.493
First mess 0645!

18:20.566 --> 18:25.435
None of this made sense.
There were 2 4 hours in a day, not 600.

18:25.504 --> 18:28.439
And why, after cleaning,
would you make a mess? (scoffs)

18:31.043 --> 18:34.911
You again,
Everything cIear. maggot?

18:34.981 --> 18:38.712
WeII. now that you ask.
my watch onIy has 1 2 hours on it,

18:38.784 --> 18:41.753
You get dumber by the minute. don't you?

18:43.255 --> 18:45.587
That is aII,

18:51.330 --> 18:54.527
(whispering)
You're forgetting something. maggot,

18:54.600 --> 18:56.727
What?

18:57.770 --> 18:59.795
Oh!

19:08.314 --> 19:10.805
Now. who wouId put that there?

19:11.817 --> 19:15.753
Ma'am. permission to speak. ma'am,
It's about the maggot. ma'am,

19:17.056 --> 19:18.887
Ma'am. this cadet voIunteers
to teach the maggot

19:18.958 --> 19:22.485
miIitary protocoI and terminoIogy. ma'am,

19:22.561 --> 19:25.086
Do it, Fast!

19:25.164 --> 19:28.861
And teII her about the crocodiIe I wrestIed,

19:31.070 --> 19:34.198
First Iesson: zip it and Iisten,

19:34.273 --> 19:36.798
Two things I have never mastered,

19:36.876 --> 19:40.243
Everybody has a rank,
BasicaIIy. you saIute officers,

19:40.312 --> 19:41.745
I've heard of generaIs,

19:41.814 --> 19:47.184
Uh. weII. you can teII a person's rank
by Iooking at their chevrons or insignia,

19:49.321 --> 19:51.482
Oh. Sergeant. Major!

19:51.557 --> 19:54.424
Sergeant Major, Hi,

19:54.493 --> 19:58.088
I'm guessing. but nobody seems to mind,
Hey,

19:59.432 --> 20:02.697
Hey. hey. hey, Stone. Stone,

20:03.536 --> 20:06.300
AII right. there he is,

20:06.372 --> 20:10.433
- How's my hair?
- Perfect,,, as usuaI,

20:11.544 --> 20:13.569
Whoa. is that Brad?

20:14.680 --> 20:18.377
Or the cutest boy I've ever seen?
Or both?

20:18.451 --> 20:20.442
(Carla) You got it,

20:20.519 --> 20:22.111
Oh. my gosh. he Iooks just Iike a rock star,

20:22.188 --> 20:25.749
And I wouId know.
because I've been this cIose to NSync,

20:25.825 --> 20:28.988
Better stay away,
He's the Stone's man,

20:29.061 --> 20:31.529
And you'II be seeing them together
at the WeIcome Back dance on Friday,

20:31.597 --> 20:33.963
- Did you say dance?
- Yeah,

20:34.033 --> 20:37.525
- We're invited too, Everybody's invited,
- Do we get to wear reaI cIothes?

20:37.603 --> 20:39.935
Wear 'em if you got 'em,

20:40.673 --> 20:44.131
- HaIt!
- I am so there,

20:44.210 --> 20:46.201
Dismissed!

20:47.179 --> 20:48.737
OK. so I'm gonna casuaIIy bump into him

20:48.814 --> 20:51.009
and just bring up
the WeIcome Back dance,

20:51.083 --> 20:53.244
- Yes. ma'am,
- AII right,

20:53.319 --> 20:55.116
- Hair is good?
- Yes. ma'am,

20:55.187 --> 20:57.212
Good,

21:27.186 --> 21:28.744
(squeals)

21:37.930 --> 21:40.865
- (boy) What was that aII about?
- (Brad) I have no idea,

21:46.272 --> 21:47.603
(clears throat)

22:05.558 --> 22:09.688
I thought she'd be happy
about how quickIy I was Iearning,

22:34.920 --> 22:36.444
Oh,

22:51.237 --> 22:56.038
It was here. just south of Mont-Saint-Jean
that NapoIeon fooIishIy tried to spIit

22:56.108 --> 23:00.772
the combined forces of WeIIington and
BIucher, Now. the resuIt of this was that,,,

23:00.846 --> 23:03.542
- Can this wait?
- WeII,,,

23:03.616 --> 23:08.849
it wouId be dishonest of me not to teII you
right now that I'm a conscientious objector,

23:20.165 --> 23:24.158
- I don't think I got anything right,
- It's just a test to gauge your IeveI,

23:24.236 --> 23:25.726
I don't think I've hit a IeveI yet,

23:25.804 --> 23:28.796
At my oId schooI. we onIy had to do math
when we feIt Iike it,

23:28.874 --> 23:34.870
It was a reaIIy good system, We didn't have
to sit whiIe we were doing it. either,

23:46.558 --> 23:49.186
- Hey. whatcha got?
- Oh. nothing,

23:49.261 --> 23:51.752
Just my dress for Friday night,

23:51.830 --> 23:54.594
Let me see,
Oh. my gosh. it's so beautifuI,

23:54.667 --> 23:56.726
- You wanna see mine?
- Yeah. yeah!

23:56.802 --> 23:59.134
Let me see,

23:59.204 --> 24:02.731

24:02.808 --> 24:06.107
Oh. great,

Oh, Oh. that's great,

Sure,

24:38.811 --> 24:41.473
Whoo, I beIieve in gun controI,

24:41.547 --> 24:46.484
Around here. that is gun controI,
Don't worry. they can't be fired,

24:46.552 --> 24:51.012
The driII team's a big deaI,
It's Iike our arms footbaII team,

24:52.458 --> 24:56.258
You know. miIitary Iife may be
for some peopIe. but it's just not for me,

24:56.328 --> 24:58.319
It's something you have to adjust to,

24:58.397 --> 25:02.060
PeopIe Iike Jennifer are used to it,
Both her parents are army,

25:02.134 --> 25:04.967
- Commandant coming,
- There's dust on those boots,

25:07.339 --> 25:10.502
At ease. Cadets,
Where are you young Iadies going?

25:10.576 --> 25:14.876
Home. to pick out some dresses
for the dance Friday night,

25:16.849 --> 25:19.079
Sir,

25:19.151 --> 25:22.917
Be sure to pick out some nice ones,
Carry on. Cadets,

25:22.988 --> 25:25.183
We wiII, See ya. Joe,

25:29.962 --> 25:32.931
You cannot taIk to the commandant
Iike that,

25:32.998 --> 25:35.432
WeII. I sort of can,

25:35.501 --> 25:39.267
You see. he's my stepdad,
He and my mom met at a wedding.

25:39.338 --> 25:42.933
and they Iiked it so much.
they decided to have one of their own,

25:43.008 --> 25:45.841
You shouId teII Jennifer,
She wouId go way easier on you,

25:45.911 --> 25:48.709
That's a negative, She's my own battIe,

25:58.557 --> 26:01.219
- Come on!
- I,,, I,,

26:01.293 --> 26:03.523
It's OK,

26:03.595 --> 26:05.893
( ''I Need To Hear It From You'')

26:07.699 --> 26:09.690
You shouId pick first,
They're yours,

26:09.768 --> 26:12.464
Oh. no, It's so much more fun for me
if you go first,

26:12.538 --> 26:15.302
- There she is! Hi. baby!
- Hey. Mom,

26:15.374 --> 26:17.968
One of the great things about Mom
is she always greets you

26:18.043 --> 26:19.874
like you've been gone for three years.

26:19.945 --> 26:24.905
- So? How's schooI?

26:24.983 --> 26:27.383

26:27.453 --> 26:29.944

26:31.090 --> 26:34.150
What do you think?
BIack. bIue or siIver?

26:34.226 --> 26:37.787

Hmm, You know. I think the bIue is it,

(Mom chuckles)

26:51.743 --> 26:53.677
Hmm,

26:56.014 --> 26:58.107
Maybe there is a feminine side
to miIitary Iife,

26:58.183 --> 27:00.208
Argh!

27:07.993 --> 27:09.824
Oh!

So. what are you gonna do when a

29:47.753 --> 29:50.381
You're gonna Ieave a man behind?
No! You're gonna rappeI down that rope

29:50.455 --> 29:53.856
and you're gonna get him!
No one gets Ieft behind! Is that cIear?

29:53.925 --> 29:57.258
I hate heights,

30:01.166 --> 30:04.966
HeIIo! I faII even

30:19.718 --> 30:22.380
Dismiss your squads,

30:22.454 --> 30:24.922
Dismissed!

30:43.208 --> 30:46.405
Um,,, I'm getting a IittIe hungry,

30:47.145 --> 30:51.707
Ooh. how about sending for some Caesar
saIad with a IittIe bit of Cajun chicken.

30:51.783 --> 30:54.547
a touch of ciIantro and a IittIe bit
of Iemon dressing on the side.

30:54.619 --> 30:57.247
with some of those oyster crackers?

30:58.690 --> 31:00.123
Yummy,

31:00.192 --> 31:01.784
Fine,

31:07.899 --> 31:09.526
Oh!

31:19.077 --> 31:20.339
Mommy!

31:25.884 --> 31:27.784
Whoo,

31:27.853 --> 31:30.344
Sergeant Ramos wiII take over from here,

31:30.422 --> 31:32.947
You're gonna do this course
untiI you get it right,

31:33.024 --> 31:35.857
But what about the dance?

31:35.927 --> 31:40.990
- Hmm. uh. you're not gonna be there,
- Are you sure you're aIIowed to do that?

31:41.066 --> 31:45.366
What are you gonna do about it?

31:46.471 --> 31:48.564
Hmm?

31:48.640 --> 31:51.438

31:56.047 --> 31:58.845

Maggot,

32:23.442 --> 32:25.569
- Why me?
- Let's go!

32:25.644 --> 32:30.911
Sergeant Gloria Ramos,
my own private slave driver, was tough,

32:30.982 --> 32:34.611
but she didn't have
Jennifer's 1 00 percent look of hatred.

32:34.686 --> 32:40.386
I decided to try and find the real Gloria,
the one who was craving to be human.

32:40.459 --> 32:43.053
I'm sorry you have to stand over me
Iike this and miss the dance,

32:43.128 --> 32:46.859
- I don't dance,
- Don't you wanna Iisten to the music?

32:46.932 --> 32:49.958
- I hate music,
- Nobody hates music,

32:50.035 --> 32:53.493
It's a primitive instinct which I'm sure
you couId unIeash any time you want,

32:53.572 --> 32:54.903
Never happened,

32:54.973 --> 32:57.032
We have got to get to the bottom

32:57.108 --> 33:00.134

33:00.212 --> 33:03.272
I can diagnose and cIimb at the same time,

33:04.449 --> 33:06.815

33:22.167 --> 33:25.193
EspeciaIIy since
I've never done this before,

33:25.270 --> 33:29.798
From the haIIs of Montezuma.
to the shores of TripoIi

33:29.875 --> 33:31.399
That's the Marines!

33:31.476 --> 33:35.606

Row. row. row your boat. gentIy,,,

33:35.680 --> 33:38.740

33:47.893 --> 33:52.421
Back home in Ponce.

33:52.497 --> 33:56.456
When I'm crawIing in the mud here.

34:13.351 --> 34:15.581
Use your knees to push,

34:15.654 --> 34:18.679

34:18.757 --> 34:22.591

35:55.186 --> 35:58.747
WeII. at Ieast somebody knows
how to get down and dirty,

36:06.164 --> 36:09.998
It would've been so cool
if Sir had invited me to his office...

36:10.068 --> 36:12.400
under any other circumstances.

36:13.705 --> 36:16.606
As you know. my father was
commandant of this academy.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.336
so I understand the position you're in,

36:18.410 --> 36:22.141
He was harder on me than the others
just to prove he was fair,

36:22.213 --> 36:24.511
You know. in those days.
peopIe didn't understand

36:24.582 --> 36:27.312
how fragiIe a chiId's psyche couId be,

36:27.385 --> 36:31.446
Don't worry. sir,
You'II put it behind you someday,

36:31.523 --> 36:35.789
I am not happy about your performance
your first week here,

36:36.361 --> 36:40.491
I'm not exactIy happy with what's going on.
either, Things couId be much better,

36:40.565 --> 36:44.626
Did you know that there's this whoIe group
who practice throwing around rifIes?

36:44.703 --> 36:47.331
They're Iike robots or something,

36:48.907 --> 36:52.206
I was one of those robots
when I was in schooI here,

36:52.277 --> 36:55.940
It's OK, You were young,
You didn't know any better,

36:59.651 --> 37:04.554
Captain Stone says that you purposefuIIy

37:04.622 --> 37:07.614
in the form of a white dress.
which you wiIIfuIIy Iaid your hands on,

37:07.692 --> 37:11.219
It was not purposefuIIy,,,

37:25.710 --> 37:27.541

37:27.612 --> 37:30.775
It's time that you Iearn
how we operate around here,

37:30.849 --> 37:33.409
Uniformity is something we strive for,

37:33.485 --> 37:37.615
- Are you sure that's a good thing?
- I'm positive,

37:37.689 --> 37:44.424
AIthough individuaI dignity is respected.
the individuaI is at the service of the group,

37:44.496 --> 37:47.158
That's why we caII it the service,

37:47.232 --> 37:51.931
That's a Iesson you need to Iearn.
Private CoIIins. and you wiII Iearn it,

There's absoIuteIy nothing to worry about.
even though I'm kinda miserabIe,

38:40.185 --> 38:43.313
It's because I'm aIIergic to the country,

38:44.122 --> 38:47.387
OK. I gotta go, Bye,

38:49.060 --> 38:51.824
I had given George Washington
a whole week,

38:51.896 --> 38:55.730
and it seemed that it and I
would never get along.

38:57.669 --> 39:01.605
I had to tell Mom,
''I don't wanna stay here. ''

39:04.108 --> 39:06.838

CarIa's turned out to be a very good friend,

40:14.512 --> 40:16.810
I couldn't tell her I wanted to quit school.

40:16.881 --> 40:20.817
We couldn't bring a baby into this world
among even one ounce of chaos.

40:20.885 --> 40:22.944
- HeIIo,

- OK. bye. Dad,

51:20.844 --> 51:22.869
(splash)

51:40.064 --> 51:43.522
The point is to keep the gear
cIean. poIished and ready to go,

51:43.601 --> 51:46.263
It's just Iike in combat - when you
need something. you need it now

51:46.337 --> 51:48.897
and you need it to work, Understood?

51:48.973 --> 51:52.204
- Sir. yes. sir,
- Go to it. Cadet,

52:01.785 --> 52:03.412
Eww,

52:07.257 --> 52:11.921

52:33.417 --> 52:34.884
Oops,

52:34.952 --> 52:38.080
So,,, you caII that a shoeshine?

52:40.124 --> 52:42.217
You know. we can get gigged for that,

53:07.751 --> 53:10.151
Now. that's how you do it,

53:12.489 --> 53:14.957
You make me Iaugh. Cadet KeIIy,

53:26.503 --> 53:27.868

As you know. we have a meet coming up
in two weeks, But it isn't just a practice,

54:06.577 --> 54:10.707
It's our first step towards
winning the regionaIs,

So,,,

54:17.254 --> 54:18.949
Atten-hut!

54:19.022 --> 54:21.252

54:23.460 --> 54:25.792
FIip arms!

54:29.700 --> 54:32.100
Reverse fIip arms!

54:36.273 --> 54:40.539
That's when it hit me -
this was like ''Swan Lake, ''

54:40.611 --> 54:44.911
only, instead of tutus,
everyone was wearing uniforms.

54:44.982 --> 54:48.042
But still, it was so beautiful.

55:03.801 --> 55:06.031
Sure. I'II heIp you with the equipment,

55:06.103 --> 55:09.334
Our team may not be the best.

That is so incredibIy nice of you,

55:11.608 --> 55:13.974
Part of what we Iearn here

I swear I wouId,
If onIy I'd,,, fit in. you know?

55:17.881 --> 55:21.248

55:22.519 --> 55:26.080
Me? I'm Iucky to be here,

55:26.156 --> 55:31.150
Home wasn't,,,
It wasn't what I wouId've picked out,

55:31.228 --> 55:34.720
This is Iike a heaven on Earth
for a girI Iike me,

55:36.200 --> 55:40.762
Hey. CarIa. you think you'd Iike

Promise to pay you back,

56:07.865 --> 56:10.197
Hey. Brad. I was just wondering

56:12.035 --> 56:13.866

56:16.607 --> 56:18.165

56:18.242 --> 56:21.405
I don't mean to brag.
but I aIways bring Iuck to things.

56:21.478 --> 56:24.140
and sometimes peopIe rub my head,

56:33.323 --> 56:35.587
Guns. pIease,

56:35.659 --> 56:37.650
(feigned chuckle)

We obviousIy have to practice.

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:49.824
That performance today
was a compIete and totaI,,,

01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:51.867
Come on. give it a rest,

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:53.926
It's not practice that we need,

01:02:54.004 --> 01:02:56.438
In the reguIation phase.
we're as good as anybody,

01:02:56.506 --> 01:02:59.532
The probIem is the exhibition phase,

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:06.640
I mean. we need inspiration,
OriginaIity, Creativity,

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:11.915
Anyways. good job. peopIe, We'II get 'em

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:53.561

01:04:11.915 --> 01:04:16.784
(sighs) OK, here was my to-do list.:
keep Sir and Mom's relationship going,

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:22.223
shepherd a baby into the world,
and win a drill team medal for Brad.

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:24.055
I have to do everything.

01:04:28.098 --> 01:04:30.089

I've decided to try out for the driII team,
And I need you to be my coach,

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:11.768
It wouIdn't be professionaI
if you didn't Iet me pay you,

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:20.978
Once again, I'd seen it proven true -
accessories are a girl's best friend.

Who is the Commander in Chief
of the Armed Forces of the United States?

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:30.290

- What's next?
- Nothing,

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:39.494
Nothing more we can do,

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:46.226

Permission to speak. sir,

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:17.112
I admit it was a good idea for you
to sentence me to the driII team,

01:09:17.185 --> 01:09:22.180
It was a great Iesson for me, But. sir.
you have some Iessons to Iearn. too,

Babies can't saIute, They're IittIe,
They cry even when they don't have to,

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:42.073
They're not exactIy cIean. but they
smeII pretty good - most of the time,

01:09:42.145 --> 01:09:44.443
They have to be smiIed at constantIy.

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:48.109
and you have to carry them around
aII night and day,

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:50.379
If not. they tend to yeII,

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:27.359
I don't even remember what I did,

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:32.430
Anyway. it doesn't even matter,
I mean. there was fire. spirit,

01:13:32.508 --> 01:13:37.241
Our team couId use a IittIe more of that,
Do it again - it was good,

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:44.614
The BattIe of the Choisin Reservoir
in the frigid winter of 1 950-51

01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:48.555
was not a retreat
but an advance to the rear,

01:13:48.624 --> 01:13:52.151
One of the greatest strategic
rescue operations in miIitary history.

01:13:52.228 --> 01:13:54.662
even if it was the Marines,

01:13:56.666 --> 01:14:01.069
- So. advancing to the rear is a good thing,
- In this case. an exceIIent thing,

01:14:01.137 --> 01:14:05.369
The 1 st Division stayed together.
worked together and survived together,

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:07.807
Wow. It continued to amaze me

01:14:07.877 --> 01:14:12.371
that the stuff you learn in military school
could actually apply to real life.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:17.442
I suddenly understood why it was
important to stomach Jennifer.

KeIIy,

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:41.327
At that moment, I realized that Sir
was ready to have this baby.

01:30:50.545 --> 01:30:54.447
This reaIIy is a photo op,
If onIy I had my camera,

01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:57.510
I wouId show my dad,,,

01:30:59.554 --> 01:31:02.421
and my dad,,,

01:31:02.924 --> 01:31:05.757
both brave. both safe,

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:09.390
And both mine,

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:13.165
Two dads,

01:31:13.234 --> 01:31:16.931
And. KeIIy. you can have two best friends,

01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:25.009
Sir went into father-mode so quickly,
the only thing I could do was smile.

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:29.278
Maybe, just maybe,
I don't quite have to do everything.

01:31:31.987 --> 01:31:33.852
We're down by five points,

01:31:33.922 --> 01:31:37.255
You and KeIIy are our onIy chance,
You're the most unique thing we have,

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:40.726
And unIess a miracIe happens.
we don't have a chance,

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:44.822
I knew it, I knew it,
I knew that she was just a IittIe,,,

01:31:44.899 --> 01:31:48.426
Maggot? Is that what
you were going to say. ma'am?

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:51.939
Or were you going to caII me ma'am?
If so. you must be confused,

01:31:52.007 --> 01:31:53.668
At ease,

On my order. KeIIy has been officiaIIy

( ''One Girl Revolution''
by Superchick)

01:33:16.958 --> 01:33:20.121
I wear a disguise
I'm just your average Jane

01:33:20.195 --> 01:33:23.892
The super doesn't stand for model
but that doesn't mean I'm plain

01:33:23.965 --> 01:33:27.401
If all you see is how I look,
you miss the super chick within

01:33:27.469 --> 01:33:31.235
And I christen you ''Titanic, ''
underestimate and swim

01:33:33.108 --> 01:33:35.906

I'lm' a ono gIrl rIvolutIon

01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:16.010
Some people see the revolution
but most only see the girl

01:34:16.084 --> 01:34:19.485
I can lose my hard-earned freedom
if my fear defines my world

01:34:19.554 --> 01:34:22.990
I declare my independence
from the critics and their stones

01:34:23.057 --> 01:34:26.754

I can learn to stand alone

01:34:33.168 --> 01:34:37.127

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:37.559
Or a closer one. either,

01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:47.869

MiIitary Academy. Who takes the silver,

- It's my fauIt, If I hadn't have,,,
- That's right,

01:37:06.054 --> 01:37:08.284
If you hadn't joined the team,,,

01:37:12.894 --> 01:37:15.795
,,,we would have never gotten this far,

01:37:16.597 --> 01:37:22.194
Right then, I knew I would be telling
my grandchildren about this someday.

01:37:24.639 --> 01:37:26.163
Um,,,

01:37:27.475 --> 01:37:29.238

Since this is my first autobiography,
I might not have gotten everything right.

01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:58.990
The events are true,
the feelings are genuine,

01:38:59.066 --> 01:39:02.229
and my memoirs are finished.

01:39:03.237 --> 01:39:06.570
But I might have forgotten
what everyone was wearing.
