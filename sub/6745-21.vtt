The guy sticks himself and dies

Such as?
How could there be
no fingerprints

03:43.457 --> 03:45.457
on the syringe we found
by Emile?

03:45.459 --> 03:46.892

we found on the murder weapon.

which is another of
our better questions.

One...
Don't!

40:59.224 --> 41:01.524
I think Mr. hickman
has had a bit to drink.

41:01.526 --> 41:03.560
Two!
Mark, drop the gun!

41:03.562 --> 41:05.862
Last chance, hickman!
Mark!

41:05.864 --> 41:10.233
[ Crying ]

41:12.737 --> 41:15.438
[ Gasps, inhales deeply ]

41:16.908 --> 41:19.709
When are you guys
gonna stop hating me

41:19.711 --> 41:23.580
and start hating the bad guys?
You<i> are</i> the bad guys!

41:23.582 --> 41:25.949
Mark hickman, you have
the right to remain silent.

41:25.951 --> 41:27.584
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

41:27.586 --> 41:29.652
in a court of law. You have
the right to an attorney.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.054
If you cannot afford one,

41:31.056 --> 41:34.123
one will be appointed for you
by the state.
