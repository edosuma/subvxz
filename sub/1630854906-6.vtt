WEBVTT

00:19.061 --> 00:21.313
That's it. That's it!

00:21.772 --> 00:25.943
Oh! Oh!

00:25.943 --> 00:28.446
Easy, Rutherford.
Just breathe through it.

00:28.446 --> 00:30.364
Oh, I haven't
screamed like that

00:30.364 --> 00:33.993
since they let
my Betty out back in '04.

00:33.993 --> 00:36.662
You some kind of witch
or something, Banks?

00:36.662 --> 00:39.123
No, but I've been called much worse.

00:39.123 --> 00:41.917
Oh.

00:41.917 --> 00:44.879
What you really need
is an updated pain management regimen.

00:44.879 --> 00:46.839
When's the next time
you'll see your oncologist?

00:46.839 --> 00:48.883
Couple of months?

00:48.883 --> 00:52.595
You know how hard it is to get
out here and see a doctor.

00:52.595 --> 00:55.890
I'll give you three fried wraps
if you do me again tomorrow.

01:02.021 --> 01:05.649
Patient charts are off-limits
to other inmates, Banks.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.276
- I'm a doctor.
- Not anymore.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.944
And I won't warn you again.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.362
You wouldn't have to

01:10.362 --> 01:12.490
if these women had
decent access to care.

01:12.490 --> 01:16.702
If the prison invested
in just three mobile telehealth portals,

01:16.702 --> 01:18.537
these women could meet
with doctors

01:18.537 --> 01:20.664
when their conditions
are still manageable.

01:20.664 --> 01:23.626
The technology allows
for X-rays, family history,

01:23.626 --> 01:25.127
all with the push of a button,

01:25.127 --> 01:27.129
and without any of
my former colleagues

01:27.129 --> 01:29.298
having to step foot
in the scary, scary prison.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.091
I've read your proposals, inmate.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.135
Report to the loading bay in B wing.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.553
I have more to do here.

01:34.553 --> 01:37.223
Well, that's too bad,
'cause it's your lucky day.

01:37.973 --> 01:40.810
Some nonprofit came through
with the funding for the machines.

01:40.810 --> 01:43.521
Seeing as you were
so enthusiastic about the project,

01:43.521 --> 01:45.815
I assigned you to run them.

01:45.815 --> 01:47.817
They're being delivered now.

01:47.817 --> 01:50.444
I think the words
you're looking for are "thank you."

01:59.787 --> 02:01.330
Who's going to be
operating these?

02:01.330 --> 02:03.707
She will.

02:07.753 --> 02:09.380
How long is this gonna take?

02:09.380 --> 02:11.674
We'll just get these switched on,
then we'll start training.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.093
These are
going to help a lot of women, Warden.

02:14.093 --> 02:16.637
Don't make me regret this, Banks.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.430
All right, good to go.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.938
Argh!

02:27.648 --> 02:29.066
No, please!

02:31.569 --> 02:33.279
Dr. Perillos?

02:35.948 --> 02:38.284
My employer would like a word.

02:47.918 --> 02:51.463
No, no, no.
Antonio, I'm sorry, it's either a rush job

02:51.463 --> 02:53.340
or it's gonna take another six weeks.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.551
It can't be both.

02:55.551 --> 02:58.596
And I swear, if it's bumblebee yellow

02:58.596 --> 03:02.391
instead of sunspot as agreed,
then you and the entire local

03:02.391 --> 03:05.060
are going to be on your own
the next negotiation.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.478
My best to Ludamilla.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.614
Hey, welcome back. You feeling better?

03:16.614 --> 03:18.157
Much better.

03:18.157 --> 03:21.076
Though I don't imagine
I will be having soft-shell crab again

03:21.076 --> 03:22.494
anytime soon.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.914
Most people blame the seafood,
but, uh, nine times out of 10,

03:24.914 --> 03:26.540
it's the unwashed greens
that get you.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.126
What? It's true.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.587
- Where's Malik?
- I dunno.

03:31.587 --> 03:34.757
She's been closing out the office,
going over old case files.

03:34.757 --> 03:36.133
Maybe the late nights got her.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.760
Speaking of old case files,

03:37.760 --> 03:39.929
I just got off the phone
with the Bureau of Prisons.

03:39.929 --> 03:42.264
Inmate Kayla Banks
escaped FCI Hazelton

03:42.264 --> 03:44.391
- late yesterday afternoon.
- Kayla Banks, as in--

03:44.391 --> 03:46.060
Dr. Laken Perillos.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.811
Two men disguised
as delivery workers

03:47.811 --> 03:49.521
smuggled a weapon into the facility.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.941
Two correctional officers
and the warden were killed.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.028
Maybe you'll feel this.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.321
Argh!

04:01.033 --> 04:02.493
- Surveillance?
- Not yet.

04:02.493 --> 04:05.704
BOP said the cameras went down
shortly before the escape.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.457
Malik is headed to the prison
to review the physical evidence now.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.125
She was still here
when I got in this morning.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.710
The timing isn't a coincidence.

04:11.710 --> 04:14.171
First the freelancer, and now Perillos?

04:14.171 --> 04:15.631
You think Wujing
is behind the escape?

04:15.631 --> 04:17.549
I think he's targeting
former Blacklisters,

04:17.549 --> 04:19.468
building an army to go
after Reddington.

04:19.468 --> 04:20.803
I know that's what I'd do.

04:20.803 --> 04:23.180
If you're right,
and Wujing did break out

04:23.180 --> 04:25.307
the most dangerous torturer
on the Blacklist...

04:25.307 --> 04:27.309
He's planning on using her services.

04:27.309 --> 04:30.312
The only question is,
who's he planning to use them on?

04:31.689 --> 04:34.441
I'll coordinate
with the Bureau of Prisons and local PD.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.902
You two find out everything
you can about the medical supply company

04:36.902 --> 04:38.737
and the vehicle used in the escape.

04:38.737 --> 04:39.989
Yes, sir.

04:41.865 --> 04:44.368
- Hello?
- <i>Dembe?</i>

04:44.368 --> 04:46.537
You're not supposed to be
calling me, Soren.

04:46.537 --> 04:49.164
I know, I know, and I'm sorry,
but this is an emergency, Dembe.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.250
I don't work for Raymond anymore.

04:51.250 --> 04:54.128
Whatever this is,
you need to take it up with him.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.463
I can't, Dembe. I...

04:57.756 --> 05:00.718
I lost the manifests for
the shipments out of Corfu.

05:00.718 --> 05:03.178
I have 22 containers
that have to move today

05:03.178 --> 05:05.347
and no idea where to send them.

05:05.347 --> 05:06.682
Reach out to Fabrizio.

05:06.682 --> 05:08.892
He should be able to get you
a replacement manifest.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.020
<i>If I do that, he'll tell Reddington!</i>

05:11.020 --> 05:12.980
- And?
- And... And...

05:14.231 --> 05:16.316
I've had a few slip-ups lately.

05:16.316 --> 05:20.112
If Reddington hears about this,
who knows what he'll do.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.406
<i>You have to help me, Dembe.</i>

05:22.406 --> 05:24.116
I don't know what I can do.
It's been years since

05:24.116 --> 05:26.160
I've been involved
in Raymond's operations.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.828
<i>You have forgotten more
about Reddington's</i>

05:27.828 --> 05:30.289
shipping business
than I ever knew.

05:30.289 --> 05:33.042
Just come to the port
and look at the manifests.

05:33.042 --> 05:36.754
<i>Please, if anyone can figure where
this junk is supposed to go, it's you.</i>

05:39.840 --> 05:41.425
Look, I didn't want to bring it up,

05:41.425 --> 05:44.303
but you remember that night
outside Bratislava?

05:44.303 --> 05:46.847
- The power plant?
<i>- If I hadn't come back for you,</i>

05:46.847 --> 05:49.391
you never would have walked
out of the building,

05:49.391 --> 05:53.520
and I would've never caught
a kilo of shrapnel in my leg.

05:54.563 --> 05:55.647
Soren, I--

05:55.647 --> 05:58.317
<i>Dembe, please. I'm begging you.</i>

05:59.818 --> 06:01.779
Come to the port.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.365
You'll never hear from me again.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.576
I'll see what I can do.

06:17.461 --> 06:20.089
You must be Wujing.

06:20.089 --> 06:21.840
Dr. Perillos.

06:23.092 --> 06:25.010
So, is Wujing a first name,

06:25.219 --> 06:27.638
or are we dealing with a Cher, Prince,

06:27.638 --> 06:29.681
Beyonce situation?

06:29.681 --> 06:32.309
Please.

06:32.309 --> 06:33.519
Join me.

06:36.188 --> 06:38.607
I appreciate what you did
to get me out,

06:38.607 --> 06:41.193
and the costume change.

06:41.193 --> 06:43.987
I spent 10 years in a cage, Dr. Perillos.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.657
After I escaped,
the first thing I wanted

06:46.657 --> 06:49.409
was a private shower and a new suit.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.954
You do know how to make
a girl feel special.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.622
Though you should know,

06:53.622 --> 06:57.584
I'm not unaccustomed
to receiving favors from strangers.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.336
Ah.

06:59.336 --> 07:02.131
But you and I
are not strangers.

07:02.131 --> 07:03.632
Hmm.

07:03.632 --> 07:05.509
Before I was incarcerated,

07:05.509 --> 07:10.180
I studied you and your techniques.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.598
I was an admirer.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.684
Oh, goody. A fan.

07:15.519 --> 07:18.063
Now, are you going to tell me
why you brought me here or not?

07:18.188 --> 07:19.773
Before my escape
from prison,

07:19.773 --> 07:22.776
I was briefly held with a man
named Marvin Gerard,

07:23.068 --> 07:25.112
Raymond Reddington's lawyer.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.446
According to Gerard,

07:26.572 --> 07:29.199
Raymond Reddington has spent
the past decade

07:29.199 --> 07:31.451
working in partnership with the FBI.

07:32.244 --> 07:34.663
Now, before his death,
Mr. Gerard provided me

07:34.663 --> 07:37.291
with a list of individuals imprisoned

07:37.291 --> 07:41.378
as a result of Reddington's
unholy union with the Bureau.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.463
I was the first.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.215
Would you like to know
your number?

07:46.592 --> 07:50.721
Consumer electronics should
go to Makar Wharf in the Philippines,

07:50.721 --> 07:52.931
which leaves MK Rialto?

07:52.931 --> 07:54.433
Oh, that is fertilizer.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.852
No, no, no, the drone components.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.313
Are you sure?

07:59.313 --> 08:00.981
Yes, yes, I'm sure.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.358
<i>All this time,
I assumed Reddington</i>

08:03.358 --> 08:05.235
left me to die, but he didn't.

08:05.235 --> 08:09.364
He... He fed me to the FBI.

08:09.531 --> 08:13.452
And now I'm offering you
the opportunity to take your revenge.

08:15.871 --> 08:19.374
Reddington's former body guard,
Dembe Zuma.

08:19.374 --> 08:24.087
Or Agent Dembe Zuma,
as he's now known.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.882
Dembe Zuma joined the FBI?

08:26.882 --> 08:28.133
You know him?

08:28.133 --> 08:30.135
Apparently not as well as I thought.

08:30.135 --> 08:33.472
I believe Zuma
to be a member of the special task force

08:33.472 --> 08:36.141
responsible for the FBI's work
with Reddington.

08:36.141 --> 08:38.227
And you want me to help you prove it.

08:38.227 --> 08:40.812
- That's it. We're finished.
- Already?

08:40.812 --> 08:43.440
There's one more thing.

08:43.440 --> 08:47.361
Wait. We should have a toast.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.404
Soren, I don't drink.

08:49.404 --> 08:50.614
You know I don't.

08:51.114 --> 08:56.328
I need you to get Dembe Zuma
to tell me everything he knows

08:56.328 --> 08:58.830
about Reddington's relationship
with the FBI,

08:58.830 --> 09:02.334
including the location
of his task force.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.044
Soren, what's going on?

09:04.044 --> 09:07.547
Mr. Zuma is one of two men alive

09:07.547 --> 09:09.675
to have withstood my charms.

09:09.675 --> 09:13.095
Then I imagine you'll be eager
to take a second bite at the apple.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.097
Soren?

09:15.097 --> 09:17.474
He made me do it, Dembe.

09:17.474 --> 09:18.725
I had no choice.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.102
What did he make you do?

09:20.978 --> 09:22.437
He has Mathilde.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.190
He has my girl!

09:25.190 --> 09:27.234
Do you have Dembe in custody?

09:27.234 --> 09:29.486
I will. Any moment.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.280
Soren, what did you do?

09:36.660 --> 09:37.953
Let's go.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.881
Where is he?

09:52.092 --> 09:54.303
Please. I did what you asked.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.805
- Go find him.
- No, please.

09:56.805 --> 09:57.973
My daughter, please.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.435
She'll be fine.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.644
Oh, thank you.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.522
Oh! Oh! Argh!

10:35.010 --> 10:37.304
He went out the northwest alley.

11:29.106 --> 11:30.857
What are you waiting for? After him!

11:58.427 --> 12:00.178
Fan out. Find him.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.105
Hi.

12:10.105 --> 12:13.358
Michael, I told you
not to throw that baseball in the house.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.736
My name
is Dembe Zuma.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.321
I'm a federal agent with the FBI.

12:18.321 --> 12:21.324
I need you both to listen
to me very carefully.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.210
He's bleeding.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.214
<i>Do you have
any weapons in the house?</i>

12:36.214 --> 12:37.799
Anything to defend yourself?

12:37.799 --> 12:40.051
You mean like a gun? No.

12:40.051 --> 12:43.305
What happened to your leg?
Did you get shot?

12:43.305 --> 12:45.265
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.810
I want you to go in there
and stay quiet until the police arrive.

12:48.810 --> 12:49.936
Do you understand?

12:51.396 --> 12:53.273
Michael.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.276
It's lucky.

12:56.985 --> 12:57.986
Then you keep it.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.336
<i>9-1-1, what is your address?</i>

13:16.087 --> 13:18.256
<i>9-1-1, what is your address?</i>

13:20.133 --> 13:21.760
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

13:21.760 --> 13:23.845
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

13:23.970 --> 13:25.222
<i>I need your address.</i>

13:25.222 --> 13:27.224
<i>Hello?</i>

13:27.224 --> 13:29.851
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

13:29.851 --> 13:31.561
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

13:39.069 --> 13:40.862
Careful. They need him alive.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.614
Relax. I'm empty anyway.

13:42.989 --> 13:46.159
Hands up. Don't move!

13:46.159 --> 13:48.119
I said don't move.
Put those on.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.039
I'm not going
to tell you again.

13:51.248 --> 13:52.499
Or what?

14:14.020 --> 14:16.022
Please don't hurt him.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.233
Put down the weapon.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.026
No.

14:23.822 --> 14:26.700
If you want me alive, let them go.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.788
Tie them up in the bathroom.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.751
We have what we came for.

14:40.964 --> 14:42.882
Take him.

14:53.977 --> 14:56.396
Welcome back, Agent Zuma.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.273
How lovely to see you again.

14:59.983 --> 15:02.527
I've spent quite a bit of time and effort

15:02.527 --> 15:04.904
trying to learn about you, Dembe,

15:04.904 --> 15:07.198
but I've found very little.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.159
What do you want?

15:09.159 --> 15:14.706
I want a lot of things,
Agent Zuma, but for now,

15:15.040 --> 15:17.417
I'd most like to know
how you went from being

15:17.417 --> 15:21.963
Raymond Reddington's right hand
to an agent in the FBI.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.966
On a secret task force, no less.

15:24.966 --> 15:26.801
I imagine that took some doing.

15:27.177 --> 15:30.513
Imagine all you want.
I won't tell you anything.

15:30.513 --> 15:31.973
Either of you.

15:31.973 --> 15:34.517
So you've heard the news
about your old friend.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.478
Good.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.688
I'll let the two of you
get reacquainted.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.691
Bring her in.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.330
Hello, Dembe.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.707
So good to see you.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.509
Anything from Malik at the prison?

16:07.509 --> 16:10.053
An exterior camera
caught an angle of one of the attackers.

16:10.053 --> 16:12.013
Zhang Wei.

16:12.013 --> 16:13.973
So Wujing <i>was</i> behind Perillos' escape.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.183
Yeah, but get this.

16:15.183 --> 16:18.812
We rang Zhang Wei's photo against
available CCTV cameras in the area.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.897
We got a shot of him
from a few days ago.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.399
Look who we found him with.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.318
That's Robert Vesco.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.779
You think Vesco is working with Wujing

16:27.779 --> 16:30.073
after Reddington broke him out
and made him a fortune?

16:30.073 --> 16:32.492
Wouldn't be the first time that
Vesco turned on Reddington.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.411
I can see Vesco
stealing from Reddington,

16:34.411 --> 16:36.538
but siding with
a man like Wujing?

16:36.538 --> 16:40.375
Even considering everything those two
have done to each other over the years,

16:40.375 --> 16:41.835
it seemed to me that, other than Dembe,

16:41.835 --> 16:43.670
Vesco was about the closest
thing Reddington had

16:43.670 --> 16:45.213
to a friend.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.846
Put out an APB on the car
from the photo.

16:52.846 --> 16:56.641
Maybe if we're lucky, it'll lead us
to Perillos or Wujing himself.

17:10.739 --> 17:11.740
We're clear.

17:11.740 --> 17:12.866
Good.

17:13.283 --> 17:15.243
What do we know about
Mr. Cooper?

17:15.243 --> 17:18.663
From their messages it appears
Cooper runs the task force.

17:18.663 --> 17:22.625
It will take some doing, but
we should be able to get to him in time.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.419
That shouldn't be necessary.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.421
Dembe will tell us
everything we need to know.

17:26.963 --> 17:32.135
Get rid of the phone before you pick up
our friend. I don't want it tracked.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.182
It's been over an hour.

17:37.182 --> 17:41.561
By now, the toxin has suffused
every nerve ending in your body.

17:42.020 --> 17:45.690
Fortunately, I have a clever
little medication

17:45.690 --> 17:48.276
to keep you from
going into cardiac arrest.

17:49.110 --> 17:52.322
I suppose fortune is a matter
of perspective, isn't it?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.367
How did it work?

17:56.367 --> 17:59.829
Gerard said there was a deal,
an immunity agreement.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.581
I wonder,

18:01.581 --> 18:04.834
did Reddington make sure
to extend it to you?

18:04.834 --> 18:06.878
Or was he just looking out for himself?

18:15.804 --> 18:18.681
So many questions to answer

18:18.681 --> 18:20.183
and we will.

18:20.183 --> 18:22.185
Sooner or later,
you'll tell me everything

18:22.185 --> 18:25.980
Wujing wants to know about
Reddington, his task force,

18:25.980 --> 18:27.565
its location.

18:27.565 --> 18:32.779
But I have to be honest,
I don't care much for the details.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.781
It's you that interests me.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.407
Me?

18:36.407 --> 18:39.369
You know, I'd never failed
to break a man

18:39.577 --> 18:42.038
until you and Reddington.

18:42.038 --> 18:47.252
I have had quite some time
to consider what made you so...

18:47.252 --> 18:48.545
Impenetrable.

18:49.420 --> 18:51.422
Your sense of loyalty,

18:51.422 --> 18:55.051
your faith, your pride.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.678
You don't know me.

18:56.678 --> 18:59.597
Not nearly as well as I'd like to, no.

19:02.475 --> 19:07.021
Wujing thinks you joined the FBI
at Reddington's request.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.816
Do you want to know what I think?

19:09.816 --> 19:12.861
I think you left him because
you were looking for something.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.113
Redemption?

19:15.113 --> 19:17.282
Absolution, maybe?

19:19.158 --> 19:20.785
That's it, isn't it?

19:21.327 --> 19:22.453
Ah.

19:23.079 --> 19:27.584
You walked away from Reddington
to step into the light.

19:27.584 --> 19:30.503
My, my, my.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.548
Maybe our little chat actually
had a real impact on you.

19:33.548 --> 19:36.759
It was a career choice.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.595
You had nothing to do with it.

19:38.595 --> 19:41.139
Oh, I'm not looking for credit.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.099
I just want to understand.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.604
You knew you had to get away
from Reddington,

19:47.604 --> 19:50.690
but you couldn't bare
to leave him entirely,

19:50.690 --> 19:54.277
so you did the next best thing,

19:54.277 --> 19:57.614
you joined the team supporting him.

19:57.614 --> 20:00.658
It's sweet,

20:00.658 --> 20:03.453
in an utterly pathetic kind of way.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.581
Or maybe it just felt natural,

20:06.706 --> 20:11.961
leaving a corrupt, violent, white man

20:11.961 --> 20:15.673
for a corrupt, violent, white institution.

20:15.673 --> 20:18.843
I know the FBI's history, thank you.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.929
Come on, Dembe.

20:20.929 --> 20:24.223
Don't you want to tell me
all about the wonderful people

20:24.223 --> 20:27.018
on Reddington's secret task force?

20:27.018 --> 20:29.062
I'm not going to tell you anything.

20:35.818 --> 20:37.612
You love him, don't you?

20:37.612 --> 20:39.113
Reddington.

20:39.113 --> 20:44.035
Despite all the pain
he's caused you, you love him.

20:45.286 --> 20:49.666
But here's the thing
about love, Dembe...

20:49.666 --> 20:53.127
It blinds us to the truth.

20:53.127 --> 20:56.381
Raymond Reddington
can never be redeemed,

20:56.381 --> 20:58.132
and the longer you support him,

20:58.132 --> 21:02.095
the more you will allow him
to inflict pain on the world.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.305
Tell me I'm wrong.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.811
It's time, Dembe.

21:09.811 --> 21:15.525
Time to end the lies,
the deception, and the pain.

21:15.650 --> 21:17.151
It's time to free yourself.

21:18.361 --> 21:22.073
To free yourself from Reddington,
from the FBI,

21:22.073 --> 21:24.033
from everybody.

21:24.033 --> 21:28.162
All you have to do is tell me
what I need to know.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.461
The task force,

21:35.461 --> 21:38.256
where is it?

21:51.394 --> 21:53.938
Thank you for coming, Robert.

21:54.188 --> 21:55.273
Please, have a seat.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.275
So you like cats, huh?

21:57.567 --> 21:59.819
I like puzzles.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.363
I picked up the habit
during my incarceration.

22:02.363 --> 22:04.198
It helps clear the mind.

22:04.198 --> 22:05.908
Eh, good for you.

22:05.908 --> 22:08.578
I'm still making wine
in my toilet, myself.

22:10.455 --> 22:12.874
How many others
on the Reddington team?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.377
So the breakout
went according to plan?

22:16.377 --> 22:18.546
Yes, it did. Thanks to you.

22:18.546 --> 22:21.215
If you hadn't gotten to that
young man in prison IT,

22:21.215 --> 22:23.051
we never would have had a chance.

22:23.051 --> 22:26.804
You know, flattery will get you
everywhere with me.

22:26.804 --> 22:28.014
Casualties?

22:28.014 --> 22:30.099
A few.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.018
I'm told it couldn't be helped.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.562
There's no point fighting, Dembe.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.397
Just tell me what I want to know,

22:36.397 --> 22:38.149
and I'll let you rest.

22:40.818 --> 22:45.239
I've worked with
many spies all my life, Mr. Vesco,

22:45.239 --> 22:47.533
but I've never met someone
more capable of building

22:47.533 --> 22:49.786
and manipulating trust than you.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.621
I'm a con man. It's what I do.

22:51.621 --> 22:53.122
It's a gift.

22:53.122 --> 22:55.750
One that I'll need again
if we're to succeed

22:55.750 --> 22:57.710
in bringing down Reddington.

22:58.669 --> 23:00.004
What do you have in mind?

23:00.004 --> 23:03.091
This could all end, Dembe.

23:03.091 --> 23:07.553
Just tell me,
where can we find the task force?

23:15.520 --> 23:17.105
Hello, gorgeous.

23:17.105 --> 23:20.441
Dr. Perillos, how's our guest?

23:20.441 --> 23:22.568
Unconscious.

23:22.568 --> 23:27.657
Not as strong as I remember,
but still stubborn as a mule.

23:27.657 --> 23:29.158
Who's he?

23:29.158 --> 23:30.743
The man who
broke you out of prison.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.203
Robert Vesco.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.913
Charmed.

23:35.498 --> 23:37.792
Dembe Zuma? He's your target?

23:38.751 --> 23:40.670
- You know him?
- I do.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.007
Wujing, it's poetry.

23:45.007 --> 23:46.843
The man who arrested me
is the same man

23:46.843 --> 23:50.930
who will help us finish
Reddington once and for all.

24:01.232 --> 24:02.942
<i>You've reached Dembe Zuma.</i>

24:02.942 --> 24:05.069
<i>I'm sorry I'm not available
to take your call.</i>

24:10.783 --> 24:13.411
Harold, what news of the good doctor?

24:13.411 --> 24:15.538
Nothing yet,
though it would appear

24:15.538 --> 24:17.623
Wujing has partnered with Robert Vesco.

24:17.623 --> 24:20.376
Yes, I'm aware
of Robert's latest turn.

24:20.501 --> 24:21.961
I'll deal with him in time.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.504
<i>Deal with him whenever you like.</i>

24:23.504 --> 24:25.173
At the moment,
I have more pressing concerns.

24:25.173 --> 24:27.758
- Have you heard from Dembe?
- No. Why do you ask?

24:27.758 --> 24:29.427
<i>He asked for an hour this morning.</i>

24:29.427 --> 24:31.304
Said he needed to help
an associate of yours

24:31.304 --> 24:32.972
with a problem at the Port of Baltimore.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.224
He didn't get into details,
but it sounded like an emergency.

24:35.224 --> 24:37.101
If there was a problem at the port,

24:37.101 --> 24:40.229
the very last person any of my associates

24:40.229 --> 24:42.148
would turn to is Dembe.

24:42.273 --> 24:45.693
<i>And if the problem was an emergency,
I'd already know about it.</i>

24:45.693 --> 24:47.653
When did you last hear from him?

24:47.653 --> 24:49.322
A text message, about an hour ago.

24:49.322 --> 24:50.698
<i>Read it.</i>

24:53.951 --> 24:55.494
"Run into a complication.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.039
Little longer before I go."

24:58.039 --> 25:00.041
Something about the message
bothered me,

25:00.041 --> 25:01.667
<i>and Dembe isn't answering his phone.</i>

25:01.667 --> 25:03.669
It's the grammar.
That's what bothered you.

25:03.669 --> 25:06.631
Dembe hasn't written an incomplete
sentence since he learned to write.

25:06.631 --> 25:08.049
So someone else sent the message?

25:08.049 --> 25:09.592
<i>It would seem so.</i>

25:09.592 --> 25:14.388
Dr. Perillos was hired
to extract information from Dembe before.

25:14.388 --> 25:18.184
It seems Wujing has offered her
the chance to finish the job.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.353
<i>Get your people to the port, Harold.</i>

25:20.353 --> 25:22.230
We have to find Dembe, now.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.234
To Mr. Zuma.

25:26.234 --> 25:28.277
I'll drink to almost anything,

25:28.277 --> 25:31.030
but I don't feel
quite right drinking to him.

25:32.281 --> 25:35.076
I believe Dembe Zuma is part
of the FBI team

25:35.076 --> 25:36.661
collaborating with Reddington,

25:37.370 --> 25:39.747
and soon enough,
Perillos will get him to reveal

25:39.747 --> 25:42.792
all the details
of Reddington's arrangement with the FBI.

25:42.792 --> 25:46.712
Most importantly,
where they're headquartered.

25:46.712 --> 25:49.215
- And then?
- We raid it.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.759
A secure FBI facility?

25:53.219 --> 25:55.054
A necessary risk.

25:55.054 --> 25:58.808
If we are to finish Reddington,
we'll need powerful partners.

25:58.808 --> 26:01.394
And before they will agree
to destroy a man

26:01.394 --> 26:03.854
who's made them all very rich,
we'll need--

26:03.854 --> 26:04.939
Proof.

26:04.939 --> 26:06.857
Their documents will be heavily encrypted.

26:06.857 --> 26:08.401
But if we were to access them,

26:08.401 --> 26:12.196
we'll require the assistance
of a skilled computer engineer.

26:12.780 --> 26:15.533
Let me guess, you know a guy.

26:15.533 --> 26:18.119
Thanks to Marvin Gerard, yes.

26:18.244 --> 26:22.081
Bo Chang, or as
he's professionally known,

26:22.081 --> 26:24.000
The Troll Farmer.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.334
The what?

26:25.334 --> 26:28.671
Another unfortunate victim
of Reddington's betrayal.

26:28.671 --> 26:30.798
He was released from prison
18 months ago.

26:30.798 --> 26:33.509
To date, Mr. Chang has
rebuffed my overtures,

26:33.509 --> 26:36.220
which is why I need
your powers of persuasion

26:36.220 --> 26:38.180
to convince him to join us.

26:38.180 --> 26:41.058
I just need to quickly attend
to some obligations.

26:41.058 --> 26:44.186
It won't take more than an hour,
and then I'm all yours.

26:45.313 --> 26:48.024
My men have tracked him
to a data center in Manilla.

26:48.024 --> 26:49.984
If we lose him there,
it might be months

26:49.984 --> 26:51.777
before he resurfaces again,

26:51.777 --> 26:55.906
so I'm afraid your obligations
will have to wait.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.700
We're leaving now.

26:59.327 --> 27:00.828
So be it.

27:00.828 --> 27:04.373
I just hope you have an extra
toothbrush and underwear.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.250
I prefer briefs.

27:15.843 --> 27:17.970
Are you all right, Robert?

27:17.970 --> 27:20.097
I'm fine.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.523
You mind?

27:29.523 --> 27:31.025
Mmm.

27:31.025 --> 27:32.151
Let's go.

27:41.952 --> 27:46.248
It's amazing the things the body will do

27:46.248 --> 27:49.460
to move us away from our pain,

27:49.460 --> 27:52.338
but it always comes back.

27:52.338 --> 27:55.716
You remember why I started
this line of work,

27:55.716 --> 27:57.385
don't you, Dembe?

27:59.095 --> 28:00.471
Your mother?

28:00.471 --> 28:04.350
A racist medical establishment
doomed her to a life of pain.

28:04.350 --> 28:08.521
I spent every moment since
trying to master it.

28:08.521 --> 28:14.652
I always assumed it'd take decades
to end human suffering for good,

28:14.652 --> 28:17.154
but somewhere
in the back of my head,

28:17.154 --> 28:20.866
I always hoped I could find a way

28:20.866 --> 28:24.578
to help ease her suffering.

28:26.122 --> 28:30.584
But thanks to you and Reddington,

28:30.584 --> 28:32.837
I'll never get that chance.

28:32.837 --> 28:35.714
She died a year and a half

28:35.714 --> 28:37.466
after I went to prison,

28:37.466 --> 28:42.138
alone and hurting.

28:42.138 --> 28:46.225
And I...
I wasn't there to help

28:46.225 --> 28:50.229
because I was in a cage
that you put me in.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.730
Ow...

28:53.774 --> 28:56.610
I always assumed

28:56.610 --> 28:59.530
that hurting you would bring me comfort...

29:00.865 --> 29:03.492
...but it doesn't.

29:03.492 --> 29:06.454
You want to know why?

29:06.454 --> 29:12.418
Because every time I look
into those big, brown eyes,

29:12.418 --> 29:17.673
I see that Reddington's
taken more from you

29:17.673 --> 29:21.385
than the both of you
could ever take from me.

29:21.385 --> 29:25.347
How much have you lost
because of him?

29:25.347 --> 29:30.769
How much suffering
have you endured because of him?

29:30.769 --> 29:35.274
I don't know if we'll live long enough

29:35.274 --> 29:39.987
to see humanity free
from the plague of pain,

29:39.987 --> 29:44.533
but I know that together,
today, in this moment,

29:44.533 --> 29:46.702
we can end the pain

29:46.702 --> 29:51.415
that Raymond Reddington
causes all over this world.

29:51.832 --> 29:55.294
All you have to do is tell me
what I want to know.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.046
No.

29:59.632 --> 30:00.841
Tell me.

30:00.841 --> 30:02.968
I'm sorry about your mother.

30:02.968 --> 30:05.304
Tell me how much.

30:06.722 --> 30:08.557
Argh!

30:12.144 --> 30:14.021
<i>Agent Ressler,
what's your location?</i>

30:14.021 --> 30:16.690
We're on our way to the Eastern
District Police Precinct in Baltimore.

30:16.690 --> 30:18.984
BPD just took a statement from a woman

30:18.984 --> 30:22.238
claiming a wounded FBI agent
was abducted from her home

30:22.238 --> 30:23.697
less than a mile from the port.

30:23.697 --> 30:25.407
Turn around. Reddington called.

30:25.407 --> 30:27.743
He thinks he knows where Wujing
is holding Dembe.

30:27.743 --> 30:30.037
Reddington knows
where Dembe is? How?

30:30.037 --> 30:32.122
He didn't say.
I'm sending you the address now.

30:33.707 --> 30:35.626
So there we were, about to buy half

30:35.626 --> 30:37.127
of the former Soviet Union's

30:37.127 --> 30:39.213
nuclear submarines in Sevastopol,

30:39.213 --> 30:42.841
when this little pip-squeak
of a KGB agent,

30:42.841 --> 30:47.513
Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin,
starts objecting to the deal.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.223
You met Putin?

30:49.223 --> 30:51.517
Met him? I had his superiors
kick him out of the room

30:51.517 --> 30:53.519
- while we finished the sale.
- Wei.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.479
And by the time
anybody knew what was what,

30:55.479 --> 30:57.523
I was half way to Athens.

31:07.074 --> 31:08.826
Not so fast, Dembe.

31:08.826 --> 31:11.161
You're not getting out
of this that easily.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.586
What do you want?

31:18.586 --> 31:20.170
I told Wujing I was not
to be interrupted.

31:20.170 --> 31:22.256
I'm sorry, but we have a situation.

31:22.256 --> 31:24.550
More pressing than our subject
going into cardiac arrest?

31:24.550 --> 31:26.427
The FBI was just spotted
on our perimeter.

31:26.427 --> 31:28.012
We have to leave. Now.

31:39.106 --> 31:44.361
FBI!

31:44.361 --> 31:46.989
Sure, move in!

31:46.989 --> 31:49.158
Oh, my God. Dembe!

31:50.701 --> 31:51.744
We're clear!

31:54.455 --> 31:55.998
This is Agent Ressler.

31:55.998 --> 31:59.627
We're going to need immediate
medical support at my location, now!

32:08.510 --> 32:09.887
What, uh... What's going on?

32:13.891 --> 32:17.186
Will someone please tell me
what the hell is happening?

32:17.186 --> 32:20.814
It seems the FBI
has located the safe house

32:20.814 --> 32:23.108
and recovered Agent Zuma.

32:23.317 --> 32:25.235
What? How?

32:25.235 --> 32:28.781
That's what I'm trying
to determine, Robert.

32:34.203 --> 32:35.871
- <i>Status?</i>
- <i>Dembe's in trouble.</i>

32:35.871 --> 32:37.206
The ambulance was too far out,

32:37.206 --> 32:39.249
but we're still 20 minutes
to the nearest hospital.

32:40.751 --> 32:42.252
I don't think he has that long.

32:42.252 --> 32:43.879
Understood. There's a feed store

32:43.879 --> 32:45.673
less than four miles
from your current position.

32:45.673 --> 32:47.549
Corner of Falston Road
and Route 68.

32:47.549 --> 32:49.760
A feed store? He needs a doctor!

32:49.760 --> 32:51.595
I'll explain later, just hold on.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.105
I thought you said
that site was secure.

33:07.903 --> 33:10.114
What kind of an outfit
are you running here?

33:17.663 --> 33:20.332
This is
an unfortunate mistake, Robert,

33:20.332 --> 33:21.667
but I assure you,

33:21.667 --> 33:24.795
I will hold whoever
is responsible to account.

33:24.795 --> 33:27.297
Good, because I'm not
going back to prison.

33:27.297 --> 33:30.050
No, not for you,
and not for Reddington.

33:31.468 --> 33:33.929
I understand if you want to go, Robert,

33:33.929 --> 33:35.889
but I hope you won't.

33:35.889 --> 33:37.391
Wei.

33:42.104 --> 33:44.106
I can't do this without you.

33:51.238 --> 33:53.907
- Fourteen, 15.
- He's in v-fib!

33:53.907 --> 33:56.326
- Who are these people?
- Charging paddles.

33:56.326 --> 33:58.871
Reddington has medical teams
on 24-hour standby.

33:58.871 --> 34:00.456
Clear!

34:00.456 --> 34:03.292
Unresponsive.

34:03.292 --> 34:05.544
Still in v-fib, charging again.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.463
Again. Charging 200 joules.

34:09.173 --> 34:11.091
Clear!

34:11.091 --> 34:12.926
Still no response.

34:15.971 --> 34:18.056
I thought we were going
to an airstrip?

34:19.099 --> 34:22.478
I'm afraid there's been
a change of plans, Robert.

34:31.945 --> 34:34.072
I don't know what
you're playing at,

34:34.072 --> 34:36.617
but if you don't stop
pointing that thing at me--

34:36.617 --> 34:41.038
You asked how the FBI
found the safe house earlier.

34:41.038 --> 34:44.458
But you already knew,
didn't you, Robert?

34:53.550 --> 34:55.803
Are you all right,
Robert?

34:55.803 --> 34:57.304
Yeah, I'm fine.

35:00.849 --> 35:03.811
My men found
something unusual.

35:03.811 --> 35:06.980
Where is your phone, Robert?

35:25.582 --> 35:27.459
No, no, no. Easy. Easy. Easy.

35:29.169 --> 35:30.420
What happened?

35:32.589 --> 35:36.677
Ressler and Malik rescued you
from Wujing's place.

35:36.677 --> 35:41.348
You were in cardiac arrest,
and they brought you here.

35:41.348 --> 35:42.641
How did they find me?

35:43.392 --> 35:44.852
It was Robert.

35:45.519 --> 35:48.021
Vesco? I saw him.

35:48.021 --> 35:49.773
He was working with Wujing.

35:50.649 --> 35:51.942
He was.

35:59.032 --> 36:01.577
You had them put me in a trunk,
you son of a bitch.

36:01.577 --> 36:03.287
You deserve a lot worse.

36:03.287 --> 36:04.913
What do you have to say for yourself?

36:06.540 --> 36:07.875
I'm in!

36:07.875 --> 36:09.543
No!

36:09.543 --> 36:11.336
Poor bastard bought the whole thing.

36:11.336 --> 36:13.255
We got to celebrate.

36:13.255 --> 36:14.798
I have a bottle of something here.

36:14.798 --> 36:16.550
Oh, I can do one drink.

36:16.550 --> 36:17.843
Okay, two.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.555
After Wujing approached him,

36:21.555 --> 36:26.059
Robert confronted me
with Wujing's allegations.

36:27.060 --> 36:29.187
So I told him the truth,
and he loved it.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.647
You know Robert.

36:31.273 --> 36:35.611
He said I'd achieved what
every criminal dreams of.

36:36.904 --> 36:39.948
So Robert went back
to Wujing as a mole.

36:39.948 --> 36:42.826
He was supposed
to gather information and...

36:44.328 --> 36:47.331
He called from the place
where you were being held.

36:47.331 --> 36:50.626
Didn't say anything,
but he managed to keep the call

36:50.626 --> 36:53.170
going long enough for Chuck
to run a trace.

36:54.630 --> 36:56.715
Have you heard from him since?

37:03.513 --> 37:05.432
Oh, well, I'd better get back.

37:05.432 --> 37:08.936
His minion's picking me up in an hour.

37:08.936 --> 37:12.105
- As soon as you know anything--
- You're my first call.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.777
Robert, if you're not up to this...

37:17.402 --> 37:19.863
I'm only going to say
this once, Raymond,

37:19.863 --> 37:22.157
so I want you
to listen very carefully.

37:25.160 --> 37:28.664
If you ever try to toss me
a parachute like that again,

37:28.664 --> 37:31.625
it'll be the last thing you ever do.

37:31.625 --> 37:33.627
You understand?

37:48.016 --> 37:50.560
Raymond,
if you haven't heard from him...

37:50.560 --> 37:52.521
He'll reach out when it's safe.

37:55.524 --> 37:57.109
You rest, Dembe.

38:02.948 --> 38:08.787
I couldn't stop praising you
for your deceptive gifts,

38:08.787 --> 38:10.706
could I?

38:10.706 --> 38:14.001
And all this while you were
using it on me.

38:14.001 --> 38:16.878
Well, don't be too hard
on yourself, Wu-wu.

38:16.878 --> 38:19.006
I'm just that good.

38:19.131 --> 38:21.883
I wonder, if you hadn't
acted so foolishly

38:22.009 --> 38:23.719
trying to save Agent Zuma,

38:23.719 --> 38:26.847
how long this little charade
would have continued.

38:26.847 --> 38:29.516
And now, we'll never know.

38:29.641 --> 38:30.976
Shame.

38:30.976 --> 38:36.064
And to think poor doctor psychopath
won't get to finish her comeback tour.

38:36.064 --> 38:38.775
Oh, I wouldn't say I'm finished.

38:38.775 --> 38:41.653
Easy, darling. I'll save you the trouble.

38:41.653 --> 38:44.740
I've never been to any
task force headquarters,

38:44.740 --> 38:48.994
I don't know about any other
FBI agent other than Dembe,

38:48.994 --> 38:52.164
and Raymond never said
a word to me about,

38:52.164 --> 38:54.499
uh, an immunity agreement.

38:54.499 --> 38:56.209
He's lying.

38:56.418 --> 38:59.171
But one thing I do know,
it's just a matter of time

38:59.171 --> 39:02.507
before Reddington puts a bullet
in the lot of you.

39:02.507 --> 39:05.802
And what makes you so sure of that?

39:05.802 --> 39:08.555
Because he's Raymond Reddington.

39:08.555 --> 39:11.641
<i>♪ I do right ♪</i>

39:11.641 --> 39:17.147
<i>♪ I notice the wrong ♪</i>

39:18.523 --> 39:19.775
Siya?

39:21.526 --> 39:24.571
Any word on Wujing or Perillos?

39:24.571 --> 39:27.032
Not yet, but Cooper called.

39:27.032 --> 39:29.034
Dembe's recovering, thanks to you.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.952
You mean thanks to Reddington.

39:31.661 --> 39:33.080
Him, too.

39:33.080 --> 39:37.501
I've spent my entire career
digging through secrets,

39:37.501 --> 39:41.171
confronting dangerous people
capable of despicable things,

39:41.171 --> 39:45.509
but I-I had no idea such people,

39:45.509 --> 39:47.969
such places, existed.

39:47.969 --> 39:49.513
Well, that's the point.

39:49.513 --> 39:52.182
The Blacklist exists so that
we can go after criminals

39:52.182 --> 39:54.518
that we never would have
heard of without Reddington.

39:54.518 --> 39:56.436
That sounds great in theory.

39:56.436 --> 39:59.564
Until your partner's kidnapped
by a sadistic pain specialist

39:59.564 --> 40:01.441
and nearly tortured to death.

40:02.275 --> 40:05.654
I've spent weeks elbow deep
in your case files,

40:05.654 --> 40:06.947
but still...

40:06.947 --> 40:08.824
No one's ready for this kind of thing.

40:08.824 --> 40:11.284
I don't care who you are
or how much you've read.

40:11.284 --> 40:13.203
Nothing prepares you for this.

40:14.579 --> 40:17.124
Look, don't worry.
It won't get any easier.

40:17.124 --> 40:21.086
That's very comforting,
thank you.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.839
I mean it. There's a cost.

40:23.839 --> 40:25.674
I don't think you need
to lecture me

40:25.674 --> 40:27.968
about the cost of
The Blacklist, Agent Ressler.

40:27.968 --> 40:30.095
I'm not talking about
the people you lose.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.681
I'm talking about what happens
to the ones who survive.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.559
This work changes people.

40:36.476 --> 40:39.271
It changed me, and I'm not sure
if it was for the best.

40:40.313 --> 40:42.566
You wanted to know
about what your mother did?

40:43.358 --> 40:45.777
Well, this is it, and believe me,

40:45.777 --> 40:49.114
Dr. Perillos is just the tip
of the iceberg.

40:50.198 --> 40:52.242
<i>♪ I knew light ♪</i>

40:53.076 --> 40:57.164
<i>♪ I met you in the dawn ♪</i>

41:00.917 --> 41:02.752
<i>♪ Now all the night... ♪</i>

41:02.752 --> 41:03.837
Clear!

41:04.171 --> 41:06.298
What should be done with Perillos?

41:07.424 --> 41:09.801
She's of no further use to us.

41:10.552 --> 41:12.387
