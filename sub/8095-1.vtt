01:41.551 --> 01:44.987
<i>Thirty-six hours ago,</i>
<i>an American B-52 bomber...</i>

01:45.188 --> 01:47.884
<i>...crashed into the Mediterranean Sea.</i>

01:48.091 --> 01:50.889
<i>Moments before impact,</i>
<i>the bomber's crew jettisoned...</i>

01:51.094 --> 01:53.756
<i>...a 50-megaton nuclear warhead.</i>

01:53.963 --> 01:56.488
<i>The bomb capable of leveling</i>
<i>a major city...</i>

01:56.699 --> 01:58.098
<i>...has been lost at sea.</i>

01:58.301 --> 02:02.067
<i>Now underway is the greatest</i>
<i>naval search in human history.</i>

02:02.272 --> 02:04.502
What do you think?
Should be you out there.

02:06.910 --> 02:08.901
I'm the best diver in the Navy.

02:09.112 --> 02:12.013
Hell, you ain't in the Navy.
You are a damned deserter.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.409
AWOL. AWOL.

02:13.616 --> 02:15.675
Years ago, a man
go on a bender like that...

02:16.286 --> 02:19.517
...they'd pin a medal on him
and take him for a blowjob.

02:21.891 --> 02:25.224
Instead, you got your ass kicked
by a couple of Marines.

02:27.964 --> 02:29.556
Ornery son of a bitch.

02:32.435 --> 02:33.493
Friend of yours.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.864
Looks like chief here
is a nigger-lover.

02:39.876 --> 02:43.004
Asshole, now you're going
to address me as master chief...

02:43.213 --> 02:45.704
...or I'll snap your goddamn wrist.
You read me?

02:45.915 --> 02:49.510
- You ain't a master chief no more.
- You trifling me, motherfucker?

02:50.220 --> 02:51.949
- Trifling me?
- Sorry, master chief!

02:52.222 --> 02:53.519
Thank you!

02:57.060 --> 02:58.049
Carl.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.107
Come on, Carl.

03:53.082 --> 03:56.313
Turn off Daddy's radio
and get ready for school.

04:12.869 --> 04:14.530
Come on, Jane.

04:17.440 --> 04:18.668
Get ahold, John.

04:19.142 --> 04:21.167
Way to go, John.

04:23.646 --> 04:26.547
Come on. Come on!
Get up there, Jane. Come on.

04:26.749 --> 04:28.273
Come on. Good girl.

04:36.459 --> 04:37.448
Go, John.

04:38.895 --> 04:40.385
Move in, Jane.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.228
You best come in now.

04:46.135 --> 04:49.696
I told Doc Maddox
I'd be done by Friday and I will.

04:51.074 --> 04:54.202
- Daddy, you acting like...
- This was my farm?

04:55.144 --> 04:59.979
No, son. No matter how hard I work,
I ain't never gonna own this land.

05:00.683 --> 05:02.844
I heard you and Mama talking.

05:03.786 --> 05:06.687
You'll lose the farm
if this wheat ain't in on time.

05:07.357 --> 05:10.417
Doc Maddox'll bring in a family
where the kids work too.

05:16.866 --> 05:19.733
My kids go to school.

05:19.936 --> 05:22.166
Now go on before you're late.

05:32.315 --> 05:34.442
I'm not going to school, Daddy.

05:34.984 --> 05:38.613
Not today.
Not till this field is done.

05:39.155 --> 05:41.851
This field ain't ever gonna be done.

05:49.032 --> 05:50.465
Today is Friday.

05:55.071 --> 05:57.335
Come on. Good boy. Good girl.

05:57.540 --> 05:58.529
There you go.

06:01.210 --> 06:02.643
Make me a promise.

06:03.379 --> 06:04.368
Sir?

06:07.216 --> 06:09.081
Don't end up like me.

06:20.696 --> 06:21.958
All right.

06:23.332 --> 06:24.822
Best get moving.

06:25.601 --> 06:27.193
Rain coming in.

06:28.237 --> 06:30.467
Best get moving.
Ready, Jane, John.

06:30.673 --> 06:32.504
Get up there. Come on now.

06:33.676 --> 06:36.645
Stay the hoe, John.
Get the hoe, John.

06:41.517 --> 06:43.246
Get that hoe, Jane.

06:51.994 --> 06:53.928
Get the hoe, Jane!

06:55.331 --> 06:56.696
Get up there!

07:06.209 --> 07:08.939
Come on, Carl. You'll miss the bus.

07:22.158 --> 07:25.389
Let's go, son.
Your father's waiting on us.

07:28.064 --> 07:30.259
<i>The U.S. Navy is a big opportunity</i>
<i>for a young man.</i>

07:30.466 --> 07:31.660
<i>We got hot showers.</i>

07:31.868 --> 07:36.100
<i>We got three square meals a day,</i>
<i>unlike the Army...</i>

07:36.305 --> 07:37.431
And I can keep this.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.505
They're just giving it to me.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.337
I wish I knew what I was gonna be.

07:42.545 --> 07:46.413
Knowing you,
it's gonna be something big.

07:47.817 --> 07:50.911
He ain't said not one word
since we left the recruiter.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.850
- He's just real scared for you.
- Coloreds now.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.192
- I love you.
- I love you.

08:06.936 --> 08:08.870
Recruiter say first leave's September.

08:09.405 --> 08:12.431
I wouldn't believe everything
that recruiter says.

08:12.642 --> 08:16.544
Put it away for a rainy,
or send it home to Mom and Pop.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.907
I'll come back, help mow the hay.

08:19.115 --> 08:22.084
Don't. Don't ever come back here.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.084
You get in there and fight, Carl.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.122
Don't take promises.

08:29.525 --> 08:32.085
Bust the old rules, if you have to.

08:33.129 --> 08:34.892
And when it gets hard...

08:37.166 --> 08:38.599
...and it will...

08:40.403 --> 08:41.802
...don't quit on me.

08:43.873 --> 08:45.033
Ever.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.434
Now, go on.

08:49.912 --> 08:51.937
Don't come back here.

08:53.082 --> 08:54.674
Not for a long time.

09:17.406 --> 09:19.670
Charge it when you get
where you're going.

09:29.885 --> 09:32.353
"ASNF."

09:32.555 --> 09:34.079
What's that supposed to mean?

09:39.462 --> 09:40.451
Come on, boy.

09:42.565 --> 09:45.056
You got a big future...

09:45.268 --> 09:47.998
...in the U.S. Navy.

09:49.538 --> 09:51.096
A big future.

09:56.879 --> 09:59.370
Tell that recruiter,
to take his crystal ball...

09:59.582 --> 10:01.516
...and shove it directly up his ass.

10:01.817 --> 10:06.083
I just got back from fighting a war,
making the world free for democracy...

10:06.289 --> 10:10.282
...and they still got me slaving
over a hot grill next to you.

10:10.493 --> 10:13.860
There's only three choices
a colored man has in the Navy.

10:14.063 --> 10:15.291
- What, chief?
- A cook...

10:15.498 --> 10:17.523
...officer's valet...
- Listening, Carl?

10:17.733 --> 10:19.928
...or getting the fuck out of the Navy.

10:20.503 --> 10:21.492
Big future.

10:22.938 --> 10:25.406
- Big future, I'll be doggone.
- It'll be all right.

10:32.348 --> 10:34.009
Hot, hot, hot.

10:36.285 --> 10:38.913
Hell ain't got nothing
on the South Pacific.

11:09.752 --> 11:10.946
Hold that.

11:12.221 --> 11:14.052
Carl, what the hell are you doing?

11:14.657 --> 11:16.420
Reckon I'm gonna take a swim.

11:16.625 --> 11:18.991
Nigger, you're crazy.
Tuesday is colored swim...

11:19.195 --> 11:21.595
Well, I'm hot on Friday.

11:22.131 --> 11:24.156
Those crackers see
that nappy head...

11:24.367 --> 11:26.858
What are they gonna do?
Make me wash more dishes?

11:31.307 --> 11:32.934
Someone's confused here.

11:33.142 --> 11:34.700
Better get your ass off this deck.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.306
Hey, it's not Tuesday, son.

11:37.513 --> 11:39.071
What the hell you doing, boy?

11:45.488 --> 11:46.955
Wrong day, asshole.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.219
All right, make way.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.491
Captain wants you back
on the boat now.

12:15.584 --> 12:16.778
- He'll beat you!
- Go, Carl!

13:14.243 --> 13:16.404
You got anything to say for yourself?

13:24.687 --> 13:26.382
Your response is noted.

13:33.028 --> 13:35.588
You ever hear
of the Search and Rescue Swimmers?

13:35.798 --> 13:39.598
- Sailor falls overboard, they...
- Dive in and save him. Yes, sir.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.404
You just became one.

13:46.809 --> 13:49.039
I'm transferring you to their unit.

13:50.913 --> 13:55.577
You're the fastest swimmer on this
ship and have the balls to back it.

13:57.119 --> 13:59.986
Thank you, sir. I'll pack up
and report to the deck department...

14:00.189 --> 14:03.647
You're just there to swim,
nothing else.

14:04.026 --> 14:05.789
Stay with the stewards.

14:06.428 --> 14:07.417
Let him out.

14:09.899 --> 14:14.666
The only reason your ass ain't in the
brig is because you're high yellow.

14:15.671 --> 14:18.936
Boy, you're in good
with Captain Pullman now.

14:19.141 --> 14:21.609
Put in a good word for me
so I can drive the boat.

14:21.810 --> 14:26.372
<i>You won't believe it, but I made</i>
<i>seaman, which is a glorified deckhand.</i>

14:26.582 --> 14:29.517
<i>I'm not sure what I'll be,</i>
<i>but I'll make you proud of me.</i>

14:29.718 --> 14:32.619
<i>Dad, the mail chopper's here,</i>
<i>so I better get topside.</i>

14:32.821 --> 14:36.552
<i>Give Mom a big hug for me.</i>
<i>Your loving son, Carl.</i>

14:42.197 --> 14:43.391
Afternoon, chief.

14:54.510 --> 14:57.502
The mail chopper clipped a radiomast.
He's down!

14:58.714 --> 15:00.579
<i>Mail chopper portside.</i>

15:03.118 --> 15:06.918
Diver, now!
Tell him I want him up alive!

15:10.626 --> 15:11.650
Diver's coming up!

15:19.535 --> 15:20.661
Faster. Pull him up.

15:20.869 --> 15:22.769
Pull him up.
Faster! Faster!

15:22.972 --> 15:25.634
Brashear, get on that steadying line.

15:26.909 --> 15:30.970
Lay back into it. Keep it steady.
Steady.

15:38.420 --> 15:39.444
Bring him in.

15:49.832 --> 15:51.629
Let's get him up! On the hatch.

15:56.138 --> 15:57.230
Facedown.

16:18.827 --> 16:22.695
Goddamn! If I'd been a few minutes
earlier, he'd be breathing now.

16:22.898 --> 16:25.731
You did your best, Chief Sunday.
Lieutenant Hanks.

16:26.835 --> 16:29.065
Complete the diving operation.

16:30.472 --> 16:32.804
The copilot is still in the water.

16:33.042 --> 16:34.942
It's your turn, bring him home.

16:35.477 --> 16:38.275
Take Chief Sunday to the chamber
for decompression.

16:45.788 --> 16:47.255
Lay back. On the side.

16:48.023 --> 16:50.651
Diver coming up and over.

17:02.705 --> 17:05.469
- Chief?
- Cut the weight. Drop the weight!

17:19.388 --> 17:21.288
<i>- Man overboard.</i>
- Stand by.

17:21.990 --> 17:25.721
- What the hell's going on?
- We lost Caughlin, sir.

17:26.795 --> 17:29.662
- Standby's going in.
- We can't wait. Look at him.

17:29.865 --> 17:31.924
What are you doing?
I've got a man on.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.432
I'll bounce dive,
put him on a rescue line.

17:34.636 --> 17:37.434
- Bounce dive?
- I've done it before.

17:37.673 --> 17:40.699
You can't. He's too deep.
And you will call me "sir"!

17:40.909 --> 17:42.809
Goddamn it, I got a man dying, sir!

17:43.011 --> 17:46.606
Give me a wrench, a spare lifeline
and an air hose!

17:47.483 --> 17:51.943
I've lost two men, another drowning.
I won't let you commit suicide.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.645
- Stand fast.
- He'll be dead before you get him!

17:54.857 --> 17:55.983
- Sir, the air...
- Stand off!

17:56.191 --> 18:00.685
You will lose if you touch that water.
Do you hear me?

18:00.896 --> 18:01.988
Yes, sir!

18:06.401 --> 18:08.335
Goddamn it!

18:27.956 --> 18:32.552
Master Chief Sunday,
you sustained a serious embolism.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.017
Embolism.

18:34.229 --> 18:37.426
Both lobes of the lungs
were severely scarred.

18:37.733 --> 18:39.724
Can't cheat the laws
of nature forever.

18:39.935 --> 18:42.733
I'm afraid the condition
is totally inoperable.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.366
Ain't that a bitch.

18:48.844 --> 18:52.143
So, what happens next time I dive
and take on pressure?

18:52.347 --> 18:55.578
Any increased pressure
at all will kill you instantly.

18:56.985 --> 19:00.182
Kill me? Goddamn. For a minute,
I thought this was serious.

19:00.389 --> 19:05.156
- Keep your voice down.
- Hell, no. I feel like singing.

19:06.929 --> 19:08.294
- Fuck.
- Where are you going?

19:08.497 --> 19:12.490
To celebrate. You had me going.
I thought I couldn't dive no more.

19:12.701 --> 19:15.499
- You're scaring the patients.
- How about me?

19:15.704 --> 19:20.107
Goddamn! Hey, I got an idea.
Maybe you could use me around here.

19:20.309 --> 19:22.334
I'm looking to make a career move.

19:22.544 --> 19:26.503
Maybe you could get someone
to change the bedpans.

19:26.715 --> 19:28.580
Change the bedpans!

19:28.784 --> 19:30.046
Chief!

19:30.552 --> 19:32.850
Change a fucking bedpan!

19:38.060 --> 19:41.757
Master Chief Sunday, given
your current physical condition...

19:43.866 --> 19:48.394
...and the far graver issue
of recent acts of misconduct...

19:48.604 --> 19:51.004
...you will be medically disqualified
from diving...

19:51.206 --> 19:53.140
...fined 1/2 month's pay
for 3 months...

19:53.342 --> 19:55.367
...and reassigned
to a training position...

19:55.577 --> 19:58.603
...where it is my greatest wish...

19:58.814 --> 20:02.682
...that you will embrace
a newfound respect for authority.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.612
This hearing is concluded.

20:42.624 --> 20:44.091
That's what I want to be, sir.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.527
- A Navy master diver?
- Yes, sir.

20:47.930 --> 20:49.522
Last week, you were a cook.

20:49.731 --> 20:54.065
- The man I just saw...
- The man you saw is a master chief.

20:54.403 --> 20:57.167
That's the highest rank in the Navy.

20:58.206 --> 21:00.834
Lot of good men spend
their career trying and fail.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.901
Besides...

21:03.712 --> 21:07.876
...they're not going to take a colored
at diving school. It's that simple.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.677
What if you personally
recommended me, sir?

21:11.820 --> 21:14.983
I just made you a deck seaman
three days ago.

21:15.958 --> 21:17.823
What else do I owe you?

21:18.727 --> 21:20.251
The way I see it...

21:20.595 --> 21:23.063
...I owe you, sir.

21:30.739 --> 21:32.969
I'll endorse your request.

21:34.443 --> 21:36.274
But it ain't gonna work.

22:12.447 --> 22:13.607
Wait outside.

22:45.547 --> 22:49.244
Well, look at Mr. Navy.
Bell-bottoms bleached.

22:50.419 --> 22:52.216
Shoes all shined up.

22:52.421 --> 22:54.651
Now all we need is an organ grinder.

22:55.223 --> 22:56.656
Welcome to Bayonne, New Jersey.

22:56.858 --> 22:58.382
Pimple on God's ass.

22:58.593 --> 23:00.993
Chief Sunday, we never met,
but I served with you.

23:02.798 --> 23:06.097
<i>U.S.S. Hoist.</i>
I expect I remember you now.

23:07.169 --> 23:08.568
So, what's for chow, Cookie?

23:08.870 --> 23:11.634
I wouldn't know, chief.
I'm reporting for diving school.

23:12.007 --> 23:14.100
Oh, yeah, that's right.

23:14.376 --> 23:17.504
They say you wrote over 100 letters
requesting admission.

23:17.712 --> 23:19.304
You got you some grit, you have.

23:19.648 --> 23:20.637
Yes, sir.

23:22.517 --> 23:24.542
Fucking gonna be a hot one today.

23:30.392 --> 23:31.859
Hope you're better
than the last cook.

23:32.060 --> 23:33.925
Man's food could kill your dog.

23:36.231 --> 23:37.323
Chief.

24:21.443 --> 24:23.206
Had anything to drink today?

24:23.411 --> 24:24.571
No, sir, chief.

24:25.814 --> 24:28.305
Say we go into town
and get us a nice cold one.

24:28.717 --> 24:31.185
I can't do that, chief.
I haven't reported for duty.

24:31.553 --> 24:32.884
I'll tell you what.

24:33.088 --> 24:35.283
I'll buy you a tall one over there.

24:35.524 --> 24:36.923
A bus ticket too.

24:37.125 --> 24:39.753
So you can go on back to whatever
burrow you sprang from.

24:40.428 --> 24:41.793
What do you say?

24:42.731 --> 24:44.528
Sir, I am a Navy man.

24:44.866 --> 24:47.130
Where I come from
there are no oceans...

24:47.335 --> 24:50.236
...only dirt farms and ornery mules.

24:52.240 --> 24:56.700
And no self-respecting Navy man
makes a living driving mules.

25:02.851 --> 25:03.875
Sir.

25:13.562 --> 25:15.291
You know what the Chinese say?

25:18.266 --> 25:20.325
Beware what you wish for.

25:24.906 --> 25:26.134
Let him in.

25:32.047 --> 25:33.708
I stole the pot!

25:42.824 --> 25:45.554
Get in. Hoist away.

26:02.277 --> 26:04.404
Don't stare at him.

26:05.180 --> 26:07.978
- Who is he?
- Commanding officer.

26:08.183 --> 26:11.209
Everyone calls him Mr. Pappy.

26:11.419 --> 26:12.886
He's a war hero.

26:13.088 --> 26:15.556
They were going to make him an admiral
in D. C...

26:15.757 --> 26:19.818
...before they found out he has more
screws loose than a Studebaker.

26:20.028 --> 26:21.893
So they sent him here.

26:22.297 --> 26:26.165
Better salute him, or you'll spend
your first night in the brig.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.366
I'll show you the barracks.

27:01.236 --> 27:02.567
Attention on deck!

27:11.546 --> 27:12.604
Gentlemen...

27:13.348 --> 27:17.876
...in 1948, President Truman had
the courage and enlightenment...

27:18.086 --> 27:20.577
...to desegregate
the United States military.

27:21.323 --> 27:24.986
I want you to welcome Bayonne Diving
School's first colored trainee...

27:25.193 --> 27:27.991
...Boatswain's Mate Second Class
Carl Brashear.

27:33.568 --> 27:36.731
I don't hear anyone welcoming
Boatswain's Mate Brashear.

27:42.577 --> 27:44.044
Master chief.

27:44.312 --> 27:46.542
No disrespect to the president...

27:47.215 --> 27:48.978
...but I don't bunk with niggers.

29:02.857 --> 29:06.452
- Aren't you going to go too?
- No.

29:07.996 --> 29:10.260
I'm from Wisconsin.

29:12.167 --> 29:13.464
Never been there.

29:44.098 --> 29:46.464
Rise and shine, Cookie.
Time for training.

29:52.574 --> 29:55.236
Are you familiar with the principle
of Boyle's Law?

29:55.710 --> 29:56.972
The what?!

29:57.812 --> 29:59.803
I didn't hear your answer!

30:03.384 --> 30:05.284
Come on, Cookie. Get up.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.685
At a constant temperature...

30:08.890 --> 30:13.259
...the volume of a confined gas
varies conversely with its pressure.

30:13.895 --> 30:16.090
Why is this law important in diving?

30:16.297 --> 30:17.355
I don't know, chief!

30:17.565 --> 30:20.728
That's because you're just
some dumb nigger from Podunk.

30:20.935 --> 30:25.065
I know you. Your smell hung
in every damn shack I ever lived in.

30:25.640 --> 30:27.938
Your face staring
when we had to leave...

30:28.142 --> 30:31.077
...because your daddy
could farm it cheaper than mine.

30:31.279 --> 30:34.112
He drank himself into a $7 casket,
but not me!

30:34.849 --> 30:36.373
Because I'm a master diver!

30:36.584 --> 30:38.415
Maybe you'll remember that
next time...

30:38.620 --> 30:42.488
...you imply we got anything
in common. You read me, Cookie?

30:46.628 --> 30:50.064
Get your goddamn Wisconsin ass
back to bed, Snowhill!

31:20.962 --> 31:22.623
The men you are watching...

31:23.064 --> 31:25.123
...are going to be Navy divers.

31:25.533 --> 31:28.559
You bottom suckers are not fit
to observe them.

31:28.770 --> 31:30.169
Avert your eyes!

31:31.005 --> 31:33.667
My name is Master Chief Billy Sunday.

31:34.075 --> 31:36.976
There was a preacher by the same name
who rid Chicago...

31:37.178 --> 31:40.773
...of the whoring spics, drunken wops
and motherfucking niggers...

31:40.982 --> 31:44.782
...who were making that place unfit
for decent white folks to live.

31:45.620 --> 31:48.418
The only difference
between me and that preacher...

31:48.623 --> 31:51.990
...is that he worked for God,
and I am God!

31:55.129 --> 31:58.326
Now, the first 10 of you
Girl Scouts step forward.

31:59.434 --> 32:01.368
Come on, drop your dicks!
Let's go!

32:04.005 --> 32:08.772
Three-quarters of you standing here
will fail to become Navy divers.

32:08.977 --> 32:11.036
Three from the first row,
step forward.

32:11.245 --> 32:12.371
Step forward!

32:15.683 --> 32:20.484
Of those unfortunates who pass, only
three of you will live to retirement.

32:20.688 --> 32:24.021
Because diving is
the most dangerous job in the Navy.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.225
So who wants to quit?

32:27.729 --> 32:29.788
Say now, who wants to quit?

32:30.298 --> 32:31.731
You got something to offer?

32:36.304 --> 32:38.670
Who wants to save me the sweat...

32:38.873 --> 32:41.433
...of training your sorry ass?

32:41.643 --> 32:42.541
You?

32:43.144 --> 32:44.270
You?

32:44.712 --> 32:45.974
Cookie?

32:50.752 --> 32:51.810
You?

32:53.655 --> 32:55.350
You gonna look me in the eye?

32:57.825 --> 33:00.259
What are you, some broke-dick Popeye?

33:03.865 --> 33:07.062
Let me guess.
You were captain of the swim team.

33:07.268 --> 33:10.999
You and your girlfriend used
to practice the breaststroke!

33:16.044 --> 33:17.807
Say it like you got a pair!

33:18.146 --> 33:20.046
My wife.

33:20.248 --> 33:23.342
It's in your record.
You knocked her up sophomore year.

33:24.652 --> 33:28.053
Maybe you can bring
the little woman down one night...

33:28.256 --> 33:32.056
...and all the boys can practice
the breaststroke.

33:34.095 --> 33:38.327
I heard you were a hell of a swimmer,
Snowhill. State champ?

33:38.533 --> 33:41.297
Yes, yes, master chief.

33:45.473 --> 33:47.771
Snowhill, please step forward.

33:47.975 --> 33:48.964
March.

33:50.912 --> 33:51.901
About face.

33:57.752 --> 34:00.812
You let go before I relieve you,
you fail my course.

34:01.022 --> 34:02.614
Got it, swim champ?

34:10.398 --> 34:14.129
Swimming don't got dick-shit
to do with deep-sea diving.

34:14.335 --> 34:18.863
If Johnny Weissmuller were in the soup
wearing a 200-pound diving rig...

34:19.073 --> 34:23.737
...he couldn't swim to fuck Esther
Williams if she was right there naked.

34:23.945 --> 34:26.413
The only way to survive
is to trust each other.

34:26.614 --> 34:28.639
Underwater, all you got
is the man next to you.

34:28.850 --> 34:33.549
That's why the only men to get through
my course are the very, very best.

34:34.155 --> 34:35.747
Now get out of my sight.

34:47.268 --> 34:49.293
Permission to relieve the man below.

34:50.071 --> 34:52.699
What are you, Cookie?
Some kind of goddamn hero?

34:53.007 --> 34:57.842
I got no room for heroes or stuttering
swim champs with a wife and kids.

34:58.045 --> 35:01.310
Flunk me. But don't punish
him for being decent to me.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.950
You'll flunk all on your own.

35:04.152 --> 35:05.881
Swim champ had half a chance.

35:06.087 --> 35:08.578
He still does.
Permission to relieve him.

35:08.790 --> 35:10.849
Says he can hold his breath
for 4 minutes.

35:11.058 --> 35:12.320
Ain't even been two.

35:13.895 --> 35:16.295
I believe
Gunner's Mate Snowhill's a liar!

35:16.497 --> 35:19.489
We're men of honor, ain't we?
We don't abide liars.

35:19.700 --> 35:22.100
You're out of my program, Snowhill!

35:22.436 --> 35:24.904
Brashear, you have the barracks
to yourself.

35:28.242 --> 35:29.300
Damn!

35:30.278 --> 35:33.714
The Navy diver is not a fighting man
but a salvage expert.

35:33.915 --> 35:35.507
If it's lost, he finds it.

35:35.716 --> 35:38.810
If it's sunk, he brings it up.
If it's in the way, he moves it.

35:39.020 --> 35:42.217
If he's lucky, he'll die 200 feet
beneath the waves.

35:42.423 --> 35:44.516
That's the closest he'll get
to being a hero.

35:44.725 --> 35:48.161
Hell, I don't know why anybody'd want
to be a Navy diver.

35:49.197 --> 35:50.528
Good flange work, Rourke.

35:50.731 --> 35:52.756
- Almost there.
- Thank you, master chief.

36:01.542 --> 36:03.533
Machinist's Mate Rourke, 91.

36:03.744 --> 36:06.907
Boatswain's Mate Brashear, 37.

36:08.149 --> 36:11.550
- You fail the next test, you're out.
- Yes, sir.

36:12.019 --> 36:16.115
There are seats of learning beyond
the walls and control of this camp.

36:22.563 --> 36:25.794
Ladies, this is weekend liberty.

36:26.534 --> 36:31.130
Anyone who ain't back here on time
will have to answer to me personally.

36:31.339 --> 36:34.706
And remember: One-night stands
may be over by morning...

36:34.909 --> 36:37.571
...but syphilis lasts a lifetime.

36:37.778 --> 36:39.712
Dismissed!

36:57.899 --> 37:01.266
Hey! Hey! How about some flowers
for your young lady?

37:17.551 --> 37:18.643
What's the hitch?

37:24.458 --> 37:26.585
- You're the one who called.
- Yes, ma'am.

37:27.628 --> 37:31.997
I told you. We're a public library,
not a tutoring service.

37:32.733 --> 37:34.894
Now if you don't mind...

37:35.102 --> 37:38.003
...there is a Mr. Biddle at home.

37:38.205 --> 37:40.605
In fact,
he's probably brought flowers.

37:55.389 --> 37:56.947
Have a wonderful weekend.

37:57.491 --> 37:59.083
And lock up, would you?

37:59.660 --> 38:01.719
And be sure to kick him out.

38:03.597 --> 38:04.757
Hello.

38:06.500 --> 38:07.694
We're closed.

38:08.502 --> 38:10.060
Not for three minutes.

38:10.972 --> 38:12.530
You studying on nursing?

38:12.840 --> 38:15.741
A person doesn't study "on" anything,
boatswain's mate.

38:18.679 --> 38:22.308
You know your rates and ranks.
Did you get that from these books?

38:25.019 --> 38:27.852
Look, I am not here to flirt with you.

38:28.789 --> 38:30.723
I'm in diving school
across the river.

38:31.125 --> 38:33.889
I'm not just good at it.
I was born for it.

38:34.662 --> 38:37.688
But the joke is, I'll wash out
if I fail my next exam.

38:37.965 --> 38:40.195
What's the last grade you completed?

38:40.401 --> 38:41.390
Seventh.

38:42.103 --> 38:43.832
- I can't help you.
- Why not?

38:44.038 --> 38:48.031
It took me four years of work
to get through med school.

38:48.242 --> 38:50.301
Now I have six weeks
to study for my exam.

38:50.511 --> 38:54.345
I pass, I become an intern,
maybe someday a doctor.

38:54.582 --> 38:58.109
You're too far behind.
And I don't have the time.

38:58.753 --> 38:59.879
Okay. Go on.

39:00.154 --> 39:02.850
Go read to yourself.
Don't give me another thought.

39:03.057 --> 39:06.185
Don't you get it?
It doesn't matter if I help you.

39:06.394 --> 39:08.828
- You're gonna fail anyway.
- I won't.

39:11.065 --> 39:12.123
I can't.

39:14.735 --> 39:16.760
Why do you want this so badly?

39:17.171 --> 39:19.139
Because they said I couldn't have it.

39:39.527 --> 39:42.860
I may know a professor at City...

40:29.510 --> 40:34.140
Boyle's Law describes the behavior
of gases under varying pressure.

40:34.348 --> 40:38.045
It states if a diver holds
his breath at 100 feet...

40:38.252 --> 40:40.447
...continues holding while rising
to 10 feet...

40:40.754 --> 40:43.780
...the gases in his lungs
increase four times.

40:43.991 --> 40:48.223
Why is this important? Forget to
exhale going up, your lungs explode.

40:52.299 --> 40:55.735
I can work with you,
but my time is precious.

40:55.936 --> 41:00.737
So the first time you go drinking
and fighting and leave me waiting...

41:00.941 --> 41:02.499
...our arrangement ends.

41:07.114 --> 41:08.376
Good morning.

41:19.627 --> 41:21.219
I...

41:22.563 --> 41:23.928
...have to open up.

41:24.131 --> 41:26.065
What's your name? Or is it a secret?

41:27.601 --> 41:28.932
My name is Jo.

41:31.939 --> 41:34.464
My father always wanted a boy.

41:36.210 --> 41:38.110
He was in the Navy too.

41:38.412 --> 41:39.504
Is he still active?

41:40.481 --> 41:42.676
I haven't seen him since I was 9.

42:06.574 --> 42:07.939
Good night.

42:10.511 --> 42:12.604
Fire Controlman Mellegrano, 91.

42:12.813 --> 42:14.474
Mate DuBoyce, 85.

42:14.682 --> 42:17.617
Engineman Crofoot, 69.

42:17.818 --> 42:20.013
Boatswain's Mate Carl Brashear...

42:21.222 --> 42:22.985
...76.

42:32.233 --> 42:35.930
Boots, Cookie, square away, ladies.
You're next in the water.

42:36.136 --> 42:40.197
Patch the hull of the training vessel
so we can pump her full of air...

42:40.407 --> 42:41.931
...and raise her up.

42:42.142 --> 42:44.508
Then we'll sink her and do it again.

42:51.652 --> 42:52.710
What's going on?

42:52.920 --> 42:55.354
He stays down any longer,
he'll get mail.

43:04.465 --> 43:06.092
Isert, finish torching that hole.

43:06.300 --> 43:09.167
I'm trying,
but this thing's real awkward.

43:10.971 --> 43:13.201
- How's it look?
- Looks like hell.

43:14.074 --> 43:18.408
<i>Green diver, you have three minutes</i>
<i>to get your patch hung...</i>

43:18.612 --> 43:22.309
<i>...before the next team comes.</i>
<i>Move your raggedy ass, Isert.</i>

43:22.516 --> 43:24.279
<i>- Red diver.</i>
- Yes, master chief.

43:24.485 --> 43:29.422
<i>Goddamn, I've had girlfriends who</i>
<i>could weld faster. Move him along.</i>

43:30.357 --> 43:33.815
- Come on, Isert, hang the patch.
- Yeah, okay, Rourke. I'm trying.

43:41.035 --> 43:42.195
Do you feel that?

43:42.603 --> 43:44.298
Do I feel what?

43:45.439 --> 43:46.838
What the hell?

43:48.676 --> 43:50.303
This wreck is rolling!

43:52.379 --> 43:54.779
She's limping, chief.
We're sliding down.

43:54.982 --> 43:57.143
Can somebody tell me what happened?

43:57.885 --> 43:59.477
Come on! Grab that hose!

44:14.535 --> 44:18.198
<i>- Red diver, what's your situation?</i>
- The whole ship just dropped 50 feet.

44:18.405 --> 44:19.394
We landed on something.

44:19.606 --> 44:21.767
Bring them home
so we can figure this out.

44:21.975 --> 44:23.237
You're coming home.

44:23.477 --> 44:27.277
Negative on the come-home order.
Isert's air hose is tangled.

44:28.615 --> 44:29.912
My air hose is stuck!

44:30.150 --> 44:32.516
<i>Fouled. Now get it unfouled.</i>

44:35.756 --> 44:38.884
Rourke, what's wrong?
Why are we moving?

44:39.093 --> 44:40.924
We slipped down the channel bank.

44:45.532 --> 44:48.160
This wreck is alive.

44:48.369 --> 44:51.236
- I have to change out his air hose.
<i>- Listen, Rourke...</i>

44:51.438 --> 44:54.566
...he's your buddy.
Unfoul his line and get him out.

44:54.775 --> 44:57.141
I'm trying, it's too tight.
Send down a line.

44:59.613 --> 45:00.602
Help!

45:01.281 --> 45:04.273
<i>- Chief, I need help.</i>
- Stay put. Help's on the way.

45:04.485 --> 45:05.782
- I'm ready.
- Undress him.

45:06.086 --> 45:09.385
- You can't go down there.
- I won't have your familiar tone.

45:11.725 --> 45:13.158
You can't dive that deep.

45:13.994 --> 45:15.120
I'm ready. Let me go.

45:23.203 --> 45:24.227
Master chief...

45:24.638 --> 45:29.268
...it looks like the ship slid down on
some pipes coming from that factory.

45:29.476 --> 45:33.173
They give out, this whole ship's going
right to the bottom.

45:33.714 --> 45:36.706
<i>Don't worry about the boat.</i>
<i>Get that hose to Rourke.</i>

45:45.359 --> 45:48.123
- For God's sakes!
<i>- What the hell is that, Cookie?</i>

45:49.430 --> 45:52.092
The ship's weight is busting
those pipes, chief.

45:52.533 --> 45:54.967
We got to get him on a fresh hose
and out of here.

45:56.203 --> 45:59.468
Topside, blue diver is here.
He's got a fresh line.

45:59.673 --> 46:03.439
<i>Isert, Rourke will change you out,</i>
<i>and you'll walk out of there.</i>

46:03.644 --> 46:06.545
Rourke, he's got five
minutes of air if he don't panic.

46:06.814 --> 46:09.942
- You screw up and he's dead, read me?
- Yes, master chief.

46:10.150 --> 46:13.711
<i>Isert, we can't talk for a bit,</i>
<i>think of your favorite song...</i>

46:13.921 --> 46:15.286
...and I want you to sing it.

46:15.556 --> 46:16.955
I don't know any songs!

46:17.157 --> 46:20.388
<i>You have to slow your respiration.</i>
<i>Breathe easy.</i>

46:20.594 --> 46:23.028
Please, I wasn't made for this!

46:23.230 --> 46:26.757
I want to go home now!
I want to go home now!

46:26.967 --> 46:28.832
Would you let me go home now?

46:29.303 --> 46:30.133
I want to quit!

46:30.771 --> 46:33.205
<i>I want to quit!</i>
<i>I really want to quit!</i>

46:33.407 --> 46:35.068
I want to quit!

46:35.275 --> 46:36.765
Change him out now!

46:39.613 --> 46:42.582
- She's moving!
- Come on, Rourke.

46:44.318 --> 46:46.218
Oh, fuck!

46:49.223 --> 46:51.191
Topside, Isert's off air.

46:54.761 --> 46:57.127
<i>- What is going on?</i>
- She's gonna roll over!

46:57.331 --> 47:00.767
I expect so. Now stay there
and change that boy out, you hear me?

47:04.805 --> 47:06.864
I'm out of here. I have to get out.

47:07.508 --> 47:10.033
- She's going down.
- Come back here!

47:10.477 --> 47:14.038
- Rourke, get back here!
- I ain't dying. I'm out of here!

47:14.248 --> 47:17.740
Don't leave!
Carl, don't leave me.

47:17.951 --> 47:21.011
I need my air hose.
I can't breathe, Carl.

47:21.889 --> 47:23.720
I'm getting dizzy.

47:49.583 --> 47:51.175
I can't breathe.

48:07.334 --> 48:10.667
- Topside, he's blacking out.
- Goddamn it, hook him up!

48:35.862 --> 48:38.092
<i>- We're coming home, chief.</i>
- Never doubted it.

49:09.496 --> 49:12.329
Machinist's Mate First Class Rourke,
front and center.

49:25.078 --> 49:27.603
"The President of the United States...

49:27.814 --> 49:31.341
...takes pleasure in presenting
the Navy Medal of Heroism...

49:31.551 --> 49:34.452
...to Machinist's Mate
First Class Dylan Rourke.

49:34.655 --> 49:37.385
Whereby Petty Officer Rourke
on the 22nd of September...

49:37.591 --> 49:39.923
...of the year 1952...

49:40.127 --> 49:44.120
...with disregard for his own life,
did save the life...

49:44.331 --> 49:48.131
...of Petty Officer
Timothy Douglas Isert."

50:09.022 --> 50:10.182
Post.

50:21.468 --> 50:23.595
Class 0252, dismissed.

50:59.339 --> 51:01.637
Hey, I got your telegram.

51:01.842 --> 51:04.902
No, I got the wire. I got the wire.
How's Daddy doing?

51:05.112 --> 51:07.080
Is he up and around again?

52:21.988 --> 52:23.080
<i>Hello?</i>

52:24.257 --> 52:28.250
<i>- Carl, is that you?</i>
- Hey, Jo. It's me.

52:28.895 --> 52:30.795
<i>Where are you? Are you okay?</i>

52:32.132 --> 52:34.896
I'm okay. I'm okay.

52:35.535 --> 52:36.797
Listen...

52:39.973 --> 52:41.201
...could you meet me?

52:49.115 --> 52:52.778
Miserable son of a bitch,
in there drinking on my anniversary.

53:02.829 --> 53:04.194
You're the one, aren't you?

53:09.269 --> 53:10.531
Well, I'm Gwen...

53:10.737 --> 53:12.136
...Sunday.

53:21.281 --> 53:22.270
Sorry to hear that.

53:32.325 --> 53:34.520
You know he'll kick you out
of the Navy.

53:40.867 --> 53:42.630
He's gonna kick you out of diving.

53:49.075 --> 53:51.100
What're you gonna do about it?

53:52.412 --> 53:55.575
Let him run you over,
like you do everyone else?

54:01.454 --> 54:03.319
You know he's in there right now.

54:07.093 --> 54:10.927
He wanted a party.
Let's give him one.

54:16.036 --> 54:20.666
She told me it was okay
to dance with girls.

54:27.747 --> 54:29.715
I love this song.

54:40.327 --> 54:41.316
Donny...

54:41.895 --> 54:44.363
...be a dear lad
and get us two Scotches.

54:44.731 --> 54:45.720
We're out.

54:46.366 --> 54:49.392
Lucky for us you got a whole bar
full of bourbon.

55:00.880 --> 55:02.745
What the hell you doing with him?

55:07.821 --> 55:09.049
Get out.

55:09.522 --> 55:11.717
Well, I'll be goddamned.

55:11.925 --> 55:13.654
It's prom night at the Moor Bar.

55:15.195 --> 55:18.164
You boys have a drink on me.
Go ahead.

55:22.769 --> 55:25.135
Hell, I don't know who classes up
the joint more:

55:25.338 --> 55:28.705
The fetching young lady
in the fur stole or Cookie here.

55:29.342 --> 55:32.834
So, what did you two kids come here
to do anyway? Dance?

55:33.980 --> 55:37.677
Why not take a turn?
It's a free country. Mostly.

55:38.118 --> 55:40.211
You made a big mistake walking
in here.

55:41.688 --> 55:44.316
- It's my fault.
- It's all your fault.

55:44.758 --> 55:48.592
Spoiled little girl gets her kicks
dragging stray men in here.

55:48.895 --> 55:52.353
Thinks we're a bunch of rednecks
she can shake up for fun.

55:53.700 --> 55:54.689
Hey, Donny...

55:55.001 --> 55:58.630
...be a dear lad and bring the lady
a fresh soldier.

56:00.240 --> 56:02.208
Think you deserve to be here?

56:02.409 --> 56:03.808
Fraternizing among Navy men?

56:05.512 --> 56:07.173
Think you're as good as them?

56:08.014 --> 56:09.504
And me? You better than me?

56:09.716 --> 56:10.910
Damn right I am.

56:18.458 --> 56:19.720
See this pipe?

56:21.094 --> 56:24.894
General MacArthur himself
smoked this pipe.

56:25.098 --> 56:27.123
I served with him at Leyte Gulf.

56:27.434 --> 56:29.402
Biggest naval battle in history.

56:29.903 --> 56:32.838
Kamikaze ripped into an escort
carrier, the <i>Saint Lo.</i>

56:33.306 --> 56:37.743
Went down on a shallow reef, trapped
me and six boys in the fire room.

56:38.545 --> 56:41.309
- Only one way out.
- Flood the compartment, swim up.

56:41.614 --> 56:45.448
Five decks, Cookie.
Five fucking decks.

56:45.652 --> 56:48.416
Locked bulkheads.
Dead bodies everywhere.

56:48.621 --> 56:51.988
You got to have your balls screwed
on tight for that swim.

56:52.592 --> 56:56.289
We still had intercom. Old MacArthur
came over that squawk box:

56:56.496 --> 57:00.830
"Sunday, you son of a bitch, I bet you
can't hold your breath four minutes...

57:01.034 --> 57:03.969
...and swim out of there."
Know what I said?

57:05.672 --> 57:07.162
"No, Mac, I can't...

57:07.373 --> 57:10.900
...but I'll bet you your cob pipe
I can hold it for five...

57:11.111 --> 57:13.170
...because that's what it'll take."

57:13.580 --> 57:16.014
- This ain't worth it.
- Get your hands off me.

57:16.216 --> 57:19.913
Six men are breathing today
because I let them out of that room.

57:20.720 --> 57:22.449
Now because you pulled...

57:22.655 --> 57:25.215
...Isert's white ass out
of some rowboat...

57:25.425 --> 57:27.791
...you think you're better than me?

57:27.994 --> 57:29.928
Well, let's just see.

57:37.337 --> 57:39.168
What's your bet, Cookie?

57:41.207 --> 57:42.469
Put Snowhill back in.

57:43.376 --> 57:45.503
- What do you owe him?
- Nothing. You do.

57:45.745 --> 57:47.679
Oh, yeah? Fine.

57:47.881 --> 57:51.578
But if I win, you ship out tonight.
Deal?

57:55.756 --> 57:56.814
Deal.

57:57.991 --> 57:59.891
Show him, master chief.

58:02.262 --> 58:04.355
- Will you be my tender?
- Yeah.

58:33.593 --> 58:34.821
Go, baby.

58:37.631 --> 58:38.620
Come on now.

58:44.304 --> 58:45.532
Go, Sunday!

58:50.544 --> 58:51.568
Go.

58:53.580 --> 58:55.343
Go, Master Chief Sunday!

59:10.197 --> 59:12.757
One minute, fifteen seconds.

59:38.325 --> 59:41.089
Two minutes, twenty-five seconds.

59:41.962 --> 59:44.157
Ten bucks right here!

59:57.110 --> 59:59.237
Three minutes, ten seconds!

1:00:14.694 --> 1:00:16.025
Four minutes.

1:00:19.733 --> 1:00:21.826
- Stop it.
- Chief?

1:00:36.149 --> 1:00:37.343
Rourke, stop it.

1:00:46.460 --> 1:00:49.759
Carl, are you okay? Carl?

1:00:54.134 --> 1:00:55.101
Chief, are you okay?

1:00:55.302 --> 1:00:57.270
- Hold it.
- You all right, chief?

1:00:57.471 --> 1:00:58.733
I'm okay.

1:00:59.272 --> 1:01:00.534
Hold him up.

1:01:09.716 --> 1:01:10.808
Let's go!

1:01:11.017 --> 1:01:13.417
She tried to drive off the pier.

1:01:14.221 --> 1:01:15.654
Get her out of the car.

1:01:19.192 --> 1:01:22.059
Today's my wedding anniversary.

1:01:24.564 --> 1:01:26.293
Come on, move. Move.

1:01:27.701 --> 1:01:30.795
No, not you, Billy.

1:01:31.004 --> 1:01:32.369
Not you.

1:01:33.173 --> 1:01:34.640
Bastard!

1:01:35.709 --> 1:01:37.870
Come on, baby. Let's go home.

1:01:40.747 --> 1:01:44.410
- Come on, baby. Let's go home.
- Yeah.

1:01:46.286 --> 1:01:49.050
Go on home now.
Nothing to see here.

1:01:52.158 --> 1:01:53.147
Jo.

1:01:58.732 --> 1:02:02.668
I can't do this, Carl.
I can't live this life again.

1:02:03.570 --> 1:02:06.232
I pulled my father out
of too many Navy bars.

1:02:06.740 --> 1:02:09.504
- You don't know what happened tonight.
- Oh, but I do.

1:02:14.648 --> 1:02:16.445
I passed my finals.

1:02:17.083 --> 1:02:18.243
I'm sorry.

1:02:18.451 --> 1:02:19.816
I'm sorry, Jo.

1:02:20.020 --> 1:02:22.853
I'm going to be starting
my internship at Bellevue.

1:02:23.056 --> 1:02:25.650
It'll be crazy.
I won't have time to see you.

1:02:25.959 --> 1:02:29.258
- It won't happen again.
- Yes, it will.

1:02:29.462 --> 1:02:33.899
You wanted to fight that man.
You were waiting for the moment.

1:02:35.402 --> 1:02:39.532
Don't you see? I'm not like you?

1:02:41.074 --> 1:02:43.099
The things I want...

1:02:45.712 --> 1:02:49.045
The things I want are smaller.

1:02:49.950 --> 1:02:52.475
If I just work hard
and keep my head down...

1:02:52.686 --> 1:02:54.551
Your whole life will pass you by.

1:03:04.931 --> 1:03:09.163
Most of what's in those diving books
you know better than me.

1:03:09.369 --> 1:03:11.564
You don't need me.
You don't need anyone.

1:03:13.940 --> 1:03:15.464
I love you.

1:03:38.398 --> 1:03:39.490
Jo!

1:03:41.167 --> 1:03:42.293
Marry me, Jo!

1:03:44.971 --> 1:03:45.960
What?

1:03:49.609 --> 1:03:51.770
He wants to know if you'll marry him.

1:04:23.843 --> 1:04:24.901
Come in.

1:04:26.046 --> 1:04:28.514
Watch the door.
Try not to touch anything.

1:05:04.684 --> 1:05:07.676
Did you know that ordinary
house dust is composed...

1:05:07.887 --> 1:05:10.947
...primarily of human skin?

1:05:12.926 --> 1:05:14.826
No, sir, I didn't know that.

1:05:16.196 --> 1:05:20.064
Makes you think twice
about who you invite into your home.

1:05:31.177 --> 1:05:35.671
Two tablespoons of machine oil
can contaminate...

1:05:36.583 --> 1:05:38.847
...an entire ship's...

1:05:39.419 --> 1:05:41.717
...fresh water supply.

1:05:43.590 --> 1:05:47.424
Some things just don't mix.

1:05:49.162 --> 1:05:50.459
Do they...

1:05:50.864 --> 1:05:52.024
...chief?

1:05:54.734 --> 1:05:56.258
He's gonna pass.

1:05:57.203 --> 1:06:00.661
Yesterday, he scored a 94
on his final.

1:06:00.974 --> 1:06:02.942
He don't have to be fast tomorrow.

1:06:03.143 --> 1:06:06.112
All he's got to do
is complete the exercise.

1:06:11.117 --> 1:06:12.345
Billy...

1:06:18.858 --> 1:06:22.350
...there may come a day when
a colored diver graduates from here...

1:06:22.562 --> 1:06:26.521
...but it won't be tomorrow,
or as long as I'm here.

1:06:28.401 --> 1:06:30.733
You agree with me, of course.

1:06:32.972 --> 1:06:34.064
Don't you, chief?

1:06:35.208 --> 1:06:36.402
Yes, sir.

1:07:12.712 --> 1:07:14.339
Baseball season's over.

1:07:17.050 --> 1:07:18.278
I figured Rourke.

1:07:18.484 --> 1:07:19.974
I never let myself think...

1:07:20.186 --> 1:07:23.155
- Why not?
- Because I saw your last dive.

1:07:25.825 --> 1:07:27.486
You want to know what I am?

1:07:27.694 --> 1:07:31.152
I'm the sorry son of a bitch
put here to get through your skull...

1:07:31.364 --> 1:07:33.594
...that some things do not change.

1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:36.826
- I deserve to pass.
- When does deserving mean anything?

1:07:37.036 --> 1:07:38.469
They ain't gonna have you.

1:07:39.072 --> 1:07:42.064
In their eyes,
you'll never be as good as them.

1:07:42.275 --> 1:07:44.470
- So you're failing.
- No, you are.

1:07:44.677 --> 1:07:46.474
You think I owe you something?

1:07:46.679 --> 1:07:49.341
I don't owe you
a goddamn fucking thing!

1:07:49.549 --> 1:07:52.245
You or anybody else.
You got fucked, Cookie.

1:07:52.452 --> 1:07:55.615
You were right, chief.
You and I have nothing in common.

1:07:55.822 --> 1:07:59.849
I may be some dumb nigger from Podunk
but I'm making something of myself.

1:08:00.059 --> 1:08:03.460
You're the same hateful little man
as you started out as.

1:08:03.663 --> 1:08:05.631
Without diving you're nothing...

1:08:06.065 --> 1:08:08.431
...but a son of a bitch
who used to be something.

1:08:29.322 --> 1:08:31.847
What did he say
to make you try so hard?

1:08:32.825 --> 1:08:34.224
"Be the best."

1:08:34.427 --> 1:08:35.826
Well, you are.

1:08:37.830 --> 1:08:39.627
Just don't show up tomorrow.

1:08:40.066 --> 1:08:42.034
Pappy ain't going to let you pass.

1:08:46.773 --> 1:08:48.331
What about you, chief?

1:08:53.713 --> 1:08:57.114
Today will decide which of you
will become Navy divers.

1:08:57.317 --> 1:09:01.617
The object of the test is to correctly
assemble this flange underwater.

1:09:01.821 --> 1:09:04.551
The pieces required for assembly
are on the river bottom.

1:09:05.058 --> 1:09:07.117
Once you locate
your project flange...

1:09:07.860 --> 1:09:11.626
...you will call for your tools.
They will be lowered to you.

1:09:11.831 --> 1:09:15.562
You will be timed and accrue
points for a speedy completion.

1:09:15.768 --> 1:09:19.795
However, we will pump air to you
for as long as you can stand the cold.

1:09:20.006 --> 1:09:23.134
So take your time and get it right.

1:09:50.803 --> 1:09:53.431
If you do not complete the flange...

1:09:53.639 --> 1:09:56.608
...you have just wasted
six months of your life.

1:10:07.754 --> 1:10:12.191
Divers, square yourselves away
and approach the rail.

1:10:53.132 --> 1:10:55.896
Topside, I have located my work light.

1:11:17.290 --> 1:11:18.882
Topside, blue diver.

1:11:19.092 --> 1:11:21.993
<i>I have located my project</i>
<i>and request my tool bag.</i>

1:11:22.195 --> 1:11:26.928
<i>Topside, this is red diver.</i>
<i>I have located my project...</i>

1:11:27.133 --> 1:11:30.625
Tenders, lower your tool bags.

1:11:54.660 --> 1:11:57.629
Topside, blue diver.
I'm still waiting on my tool bag.

1:12:30.796 --> 1:12:34.095
Blue diver, your tool bag
is on the river bottom.

1:12:51.050 --> 1:12:54.952
Chief, start the project time
on all divers.

1:13:20.012 --> 1:13:21.707
Machinist's Mate Rourke...

1:13:22.148 --> 1:13:25.117
...one hour, 37 minutes.
Perfect assembly.

1:13:49.041 --> 1:13:50.838
Surveyor Second Class Yarmouth...

1:13:51.077 --> 1:13:54.012
...two hours, 19 minutes.
Perfect assembly.

1:14:12.131 --> 1:14:13.962
Never thought I'd live to see it.

1:14:14.166 --> 1:14:18.034
Four hours, nine minutes.
Better late than never, Crofoot.

1:14:18.237 --> 1:14:21.400
Perfect assembly.
How's the water down there?

1:14:21.607 --> 1:14:23.837
Colder than
a well digger's ass, chief.

1:14:24.043 --> 1:14:25.374
Take it inside.

1:15:05.985 --> 1:15:07.475
What do you mean, still not up?

1:16:00.373 --> 1:16:01.362
Excuse me.

1:16:18.424 --> 1:16:20.619
- Dive station.
<i>- Chief Sunday...</i>

1:16:20.826 --> 1:16:24.728
...we have every cook and shine boy
thinking they'll be next...

1:16:24.930 --> 1:16:27.990
<i>...to try a stunt like this,</i>
<i>so you listen up.</i>

1:16:28.434 --> 1:16:30.561
Don't bring him up
till he stops moving.

1:16:31.203 --> 1:16:32.568
He's near dead now, sir.

1:16:32.772 --> 1:16:34.865
Not till he stops moving, chief!

1:16:43.115 --> 1:16:44.104
Give up, Cookie.

1:16:44.650 --> 1:16:46.914
You go into shock,
you might not wake up.

1:16:47.386 --> 1:16:49.684
<i>Come on now.</i>
<i>This ain't worth dying for.</i>

1:16:50.423 --> 1:16:51.913
My name is...

1:16:52.625 --> 1:16:54.149
...Boatswain's Mate...

1:16:54.360 --> 1:16:55.691
...Second Class...

1:16:56.128 --> 1:16:58.289
...Carl Brashear.

1:17:00.599 --> 1:17:02.726
<i>I am a Navy diver.</i>

1:17:29.128 --> 1:17:30.288
Bring him up.

1:17:31.497 --> 1:17:32.759
- Bring him up!
- I got him.

1:17:33.566 --> 1:17:35.500
- We'll bring him home.
- Sailor!

1:17:35.701 --> 1:17:37.726
Disregard that order!

1:17:39.505 --> 1:17:41.268
Sailor! Sailor!

1:17:42.308 --> 1:17:47.007
Chief Sunday, effective immediately...

1:17:47.279 --> 1:17:50.578
...I am relieving you of your duties!

1:17:51.083 --> 1:17:53.074
Do you hear me, chief?!

1:17:56.088 --> 1:17:57.350
Haul in that line.

1:18:21.747 --> 1:18:24.716
Come on, Brashear.
You're almost there.

1:18:25.384 --> 1:18:26.373
A few more steps.

1:18:27.520 --> 1:18:28.919
Come on. We'll help you.

1:18:44.803 --> 1:18:46.134
Open up.

1:19:05.424 --> 1:19:07.654
Boatswain's Mate Carl Brashear...

1:19:08.694 --> 1:19:10.161
...nine hours, 31 minutes.

1:19:10.829 --> 1:19:12.524
Perfect assembly.

1:19:20.372 --> 1:19:21.566
Get him inside.

1:19:39.758 --> 1:19:43.023
- Carl, did, did...
- Slow down, Snowhill.

1:19:43.228 --> 1:19:46.527
They put me back in the program.
I start training next week.

1:19:46.732 --> 1:19:47.892
Congratulations.

1:19:49.068 --> 1:19:50.365
Thanks, Carl.

1:19:51.570 --> 1:19:52.594
I almost forgot.

1:19:52.805 --> 1:19:55.296
- You hear about Sunday?
- No.

1:19:55.507 --> 1:19:58.965
Mr. Pappy blew a gasket
when the son of a bitch passed you.

1:19:59.178 --> 1:20:02.147
He busted him down a stripe
and shipped him out.

1:20:02.481 --> 1:20:04.779
I guess that fucker got his
in the end.

1:20:06.418 --> 1:20:08.045
I guess he did.

1:20:14.360 --> 1:20:15.793
I guess he did.

1:21:21.794 --> 1:21:23.193
From the gentleman.

1:21:38.477 --> 1:21:39.705
You hate champagne.

1:21:41.180 --> 1:21:45.640
- You got a diving assignment.
- Brooklyn Navy Yard, standby diver.

1:21:45.851 --> 1:21:48.513
Brooklyn? Brooklyn.

1:21:48.887 --> 1:21:52.186
Baby, we can have dinner
like an old married couple.

1:21:52.391 --> 1:21:55.292
Oh, well, baby, I didn't take the job.

1:21:55.494 --> 1:21:57.894
We waited three years
for that slot to open up.

1:21:58.097 --> 1:22:00.429
I don't move up in rank unless I dive.

1:22:00.632 --> 1:22:02.600
I won't make master as a standby.

1:22:03.569 --> 1:22:05.366
I'll find something else.

1:22:11.343 --> 1:22:13.004
I'm three months late.

1:22:13.412 --> 1:22:14.606
Late for what?

1:22:20.719 --> 1:22:23.415
You're going to have a...?
A real baby?

1:22:24.923 --> 1:22:26.254
We're gonna have a baby!

1:22:26.458 --> 1:22:28.187
We're gonna have a real baby!

1:22:28.427 --> 1:22:29.621
We're gonna have a baby!

1:22:29.828 --> 1:22:33.355
Ladies, gentlemen,
and the rest of you lowdown cats...

1:22:33.665 --> 1:22:35.257
...it's time to ring in the New Year.

1:22:35.467 --> 1:22:37.162
Happy New Year.

1:22:40.239 --> 1:22:41.797
Happy New Year.

1:22:57.756 --> 1:22:59.815
You have to let them know who's boss.

1:23:00.025 --> 1:23:02.619
Or they'll never salute you
the rest of your life.

1:23:04.930 --> 1:23:05.919
Excuse me.

1:23:07.933 --> 1:23:10.401
What'd I tell you, hon?
He don't remember me.

1:23:14.006 --> 1:23:17.339
Senior Chief Sunday, <i>U.S.S. Hoist.</i>

1:23:20.078 --> 1:23:22.103
You ended my diving career,
lieutenant.

1:23:22.481 --> 1:23:23.505
Lieutenant Commander...

1:23:24.249 --> 1:23:26.240
...Hanks. Pleased to meet you.

1:23:26.451 --> 1:23:28.180
That was a long time ago, chief.

1:23:28.387 --> 1:23:30.014
Ancient history.

1:23:31.890 --> 1:23:35.587
Well, we just came by to say hey.

1:23:37.563 --> 1:23:40.396
- Auld lang syne and all.
- Auld lang syne.

1:23:41.533 --> 1:23:43.364
I didn't know you had a daughter.

1:23:43.869 --> 1:23:45.097
Right.

1:23:46.071 --> 1:23:47.470
She's quite lovely.

1:23:49.408 --> 1:23:52.741
We gotta go now,
because Billy's gonna dance with me.

1:23:52.945 --> 1:23:54.742
Happy New Year.

1:23:54.947 --> 1:23:56.471
- Have fun.
- Come on, Billy.

1:23:56.915 --> 1:24:00.146
You're gonna dance
with your lovely wife, right?

1:24:08.427 --> 1:24:11.225
See? Now wasn't that easy?

1:24:12.030 --> 1:24:14.055
- Has-been.
- Yes.

1:24:15.167 --> 1:24:18.068
No. Billy.

1:24:18.270 --> 1:24:20.795
He's the biggest drunk
in the Navy is all.

1:24:37.389 --> 1:24:38.856
<i>Senior Chief Sunday...</i>

1:24:39.691 --> 1:24:44.151
...you violated Article 90 of
the Uniform Code of Military Justice:

1:24:44.363 --> 1:24:46.627
Assaulting a superior
commission officer.

1:24:47.232 --> 1:24:50.224
Your conduct
is completely unacceptable.

1:24:50.435 --> 1:24:53.097
You're fined one half
month's pay for six months...

1:24:53.305 --> 1:24:56.206
...restricted to the base
for two months...

1:24:56.408 --> 1:25:00.071
...and are hereby reduced
in rank to chief petty officer.

1:25:00.746 --> 1:25:03.738
<i>For those just joining us,</i>
<i>our top story continues...</i>

1:25:03.949 --> 1:25:06.941
<i>...thousands of miles away</i>
<i>in the Mediterranean Sea.</i>

1:25:07.152 --> 1:25:10.610
<i>Hours ago, an American B-52 bomber</i>
<i>flying a routine mission...</i>

1:25:10.822 --> 1:25:14.918
<i>...over the coast of Spain</i>
<i>slammed into the Spanish countryside.</i>

1:25:15.127 --> 1:25:19.530
<i>Moments before, the bomber's crew</i>
<i>jettisoned their nuclear payload.</i>

1:25:19.731 --> 1:25:22.666
<i>Three 50-megaton</i>
<i>warheads parachuted to Earth.</i>

1:25:22.868 --> 1:25:27.737
<i>Two were recovered. However, a third</i>
<i>hydrogen bomb remains lost at sea.</i>

1:25:27.940 --> 1:25:29.305
You made it.

1:25:29.641 --> 1:25:32.804
Becky, get your toys.
Your daddy will be home soon.

1:25:36.081 --> 1:25:38.914
<i>Investigating in deep water</i>
<i>will be the work of ALVIN...</i>

1:25:39.117 --> 1:25:43.110
<i>...a two-man submersible on loan from</i>
<i>Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.</i>

1:25:43.322 --> 1:25:47.349
<i>As Navy ships comb the Mediterranean</i>
<i>in search of the warhead...</i>

1:25:47.559 --> 1:25:49.390
<i>...so do Russian submarines.</i>

1:25:49.594 --> 1:25:53.360
<i>Since the bomb disappeared</i>
<i>in international waters...</i>

1:25:53.565 --> 1:25:55.499
<i>...it belongs to whoever finds it.</i>

1:25:56.001 --> 1:25:58.629
<i>Charged with locating it</i>
<i>before the Soviets...</i>

1:25:58.837 --> 1:26:01.931
<i>...are the elite Navy deep-sea divers</i>
<i>pictured here.</i>

1:26:02.140 --> 1:26:06.577
<i>Stationed in Norfolk, Virginia, the</i>
<i>divers were flown here hours ago...</i>

1:26:06.778 --> 1:26:10.441
<i>...many still dressed in the uniforms</i>
<i>they had on this morning.</i>

1:26:21.493 --> 1:26:23.154
Blue diver, this is captain.

1:26:27.566 --> 1:26:28.863
<i>Blue diver, come in.</i>

1:26:30.202 --> 1:26:32.136
I'm here, Hart. What do you need?

1:26:33.305 --> 1:26:36.866
<i>Carl, I'd appreciate it if you could</i>
<i>find my lost nuke for me.</i>

1:26:37.075 --> 1:26:39.475
<i>I'd like to make admiral before I die.</i>

1:26:39.678 --> 1:26:41.669
I'm doing my best, Hart.

1:27:10.042 --> 1:27:13.500
I have an unidentified metal object
protruding from the bottom.

1:27:13.712 --> 1:27:15.942
He has something.
Proceed with caution.

1:27:16.148 --> 1:27:17.581
Roger that.

1:27:27.025 --> 1:27:29.289
Topside, we have a Coke can.

1:27:29.961 --> 1:27:31.724
Goddamn Coke can.

1:27:32.230 --> 1:27:35.631
<i>Bring it up anyway, chief.</i>
<i>I like my ocean clean.</i>

1:27:40.639 --> 1:27:42.539
Turn sonar off. A diver's down...

1:27:42.741 --> 1:27:45.175
- That's not our sonar.
- What?

1:27:47.012 --> 1:27:48.138
Shit.

1:27:49.714 --> 1:27:51.875
Alpha Whiskey, this is Charlie Victor.

1:27:52.084 --> 1:27:54.951
I've got an unknown object.
Probable submarine.

1:27:56.721 --> 1:27:58.814
<i>Blue diver,</i>
<i>we have an unknown contact.</i>

1:27:59.024 --> 1:28:01.390
<i>Probable Russian sub.</i>
<i>Bearing at 209...</i>

1:28:01.593 --> 1:28:04.528
<i>...at 16 knots</i>
<i>and headed directly for you.</i>

1:28:04.729 --> 1:28:07.994
<i>Take immediate evasive action.</i>
<i>Immediate evasive action.</i>

1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:12.136
<i>Prepare for emergency surface.</i>
<i>Blue diver, do you hear me?</i>

1:28:12.337 --> 1:28:13.429
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

1:28:13.638 --> 1:28:14.662
Blue diver?

1:28:18.276 --> 1:28:19.538
Talk to me, Carl.

1:28:49.774 --> 1:28:51.036
Talk to me, Carl.

1:29:04.256 --> 1:29:05.280
Come in, blue diver.

1:29:15.600 --> 1:29:17.693
Tell the dive station
to supply a standby.

1:29:19.804 --> 1:29:21.203
<i>Come in, Carl.</i>

1:29:31.816 --> 1:29:33.374
Come on, Carl.

1:29:52.337 --> 1:29:53.998
<i>Carl, do you read me?</i>

1:29:54.906 --> 1:29:56.032
I'm here, captain.

1:29:57.008 --> 1:29:58.032
He's there.

1:29:58.743 --> 1:30:01.644
Prepare to surface, Carl.
We're bringing you home.

1:30:11.056 --> 1:30:15.720
<i>Next time you scare the shit out of me</i>
<i>give me a courtesy warning first.</i>

1:30:27.138 --> 1:30:30.107
Captain, the sub kicked up
half the ocean bottom.

1:30:30.308 --> 1:30:31.673
It found it for us!

1:30:32.310 --> 1:30:33.402
You're kidding.

1:30:34.546 --> 1:30:35.911
Oh, yeah!

1:30:36.214 --> 1:30:37.442
He thinks he found it.

1:30:38.016 --> 1:30:39.950
Yeah, you got it. That's it.

1:30:43.221 --> 1:30:44.381
Steady!

1:30:44.990 --> 1:30:48.551
Steady. Let's take it in.
Bring it up.

1:30:58.036 --> 1:30:59.367
Let's go now.

1:31:16.187 --> 1:31:17.245
Move!

1:32:20.585 --> 1:32:21.609
Jo.

1:32:31.863 --> 1:32:33.797
I was so scared.

1:32:33.998 --> 1:32:35.465
I'm sorry.

1:32:42.774 --> 1:32:44.571
Oh, shit.

1:32:49.013 --> 1:32:50.480
Your leg...

1:32:51.015 --> 1:32:52.846
...was nearly severed.

1:32:55.620 --> 1:32:57.679
It's gonna take time to heal.

1:33:00.024 --> 1:33:04.188
Eventually, you're gonna be able
to walk again, with a cane.

1:33:07.232 --> 1:33:08.927
Can I still dive?

1:33:11.970 --> 1:33:13.699
I'm so sorry.

1:33:49.874 --> 1:33:51.637
Come home, Carl.

1:33:59.884 --> 1:34:03.615
Your husband was found drunk
on a public beach this morning.

1:34:03.822 --> 1:34:08.418
He's an alcoholic and must remain here
in detox for 30 days.

1:34:08.626 --> 1:34:11.561
If he should stagger,
he will not fall!

1:34:11.763 --> 1:34:15.028
If he should fall,
he will fall in such a manner...

1:34:15.233 --> 1:34:16.530
...as to cover up his rate...

1:34:16.734 --> 1:34:20.261
...so that passersby will think
he is an officer!

1:34:22.907 --> 1:34:25.398
A chief petty officer shall not drink.

1:34:25.610 --> 1:34:29.068
However, if he should drink,
he shall not get drunk.

1:34:29.280 --> 1:34:33.080
If he should get drunk,
he shall not stagger!

1:34:33.284 --> 1:34:36.344
If he should stagger,
he shall not fall!

1:34:36.554 --> 1:34:40.115
And if he should fall,
he will fall in such a manner...

1:34:40.325 --> 1:34:43.988
...as to cover up his rate, so
passersby will think he's an officer!

1:34:45.730 --> 1:34:48.699
We're all extremely proud of you,
Chief Brashear.

1:34:48.900 --> 1:34:53.564
Now get better so you can go home
and enjoy your retirement.

1:34:53.771 --> 1:34:54.965
Give us a smile, chief.

1:34:55.173 --> 1:34:58.700
- How will you spend retirement?
- How's it feel to be a hero?

1:35:19.731 --> 1:35:20.959
Hey, you.

1:36:01.673 --> 1:36:02.901
Sweetheart...

1:36:08.279 --> 1:36:10.008
...you'll never dive again.

1:36:14.852 --> 1:36:16.752
And what you gotta do now...

1:36:17.655 --> 1:36:19.589
...I can't help you with.

1:36:25.163 --> 1:36:27.131
But when you're ready to leave...

1:36:27.599 --> 1:36:32.400
...and if you can promise me you'll
never take another drink again...

1:36:32.904 --> 1:36:36.067
...I'll be waiting for you
in that car over there.

1:36:40.278 --> 1:36:41.802
But if you can't...

1:36:48.286 --> 1:36:50.151
...then you just walk on by.

1:37:35.166 --> 1:37:36.565
Package for you, sir.

1:37:59.824 --> 1:38:01.587
<i>I want to come back.</i>

1:38:02.260 --> 1:38:04.990
- To where, chief?
- Full diving duty.

1:38:05.797 --> 1:38:07.492
I want to dive again.

1:38:07.732 --> 1:38:09.256
Carl...

1:38:09.667 --> 1:38:11.999
...I understand but...
- But...

1:38:12.704 --> 1:38:14.467
...it's just not possible.

1:38:15.807 --> 1:38:17.604
Good afternoon, admiral.

1:38:18.076 --> 1:38:20.306
- Carl, this is...
- Captain Hanks.

1:38:20.611 --> 1:38:21.600
Chief Brashear.

1:38:21.879 --> 1:38:24.507
Captain Hanks is the senior officer...

1:38:24.716 --> 1:38:28.550
...of the Personnel Policy
Control Board at the Pentagon.

1:38:28.753 --> 1:38:30.277
He'll be with us a few weeks...

1:38:30.488 --> 1:38:34.015
...meeting some of the men from the
front lines, hearing their concerns.

1:38:34.225 --> 1:38:36.819
To return to the chief's
primary concern.

1:38:37.028 --> 1:38:41.124
Working as a Navy diver
with one good leg and the other...

1:38:41.766 --> 1:38:44.200
I'm sorry, it's just not possible.

1:38:44.402 --> 1:38:45.426
Cut it off.

1:38:49.207 --> 1:38:53.007
"Injured pilots have requested
amputation of injured limbs.

1:38:53.211 --> 1:38:56.374
With a prosthesis,
several have returned to duty."

1:38:57.715 --> 1:38:58.841
I'm asking this:

1:38:59.050 --> 1:39:03.987
Cut off my leg and assemble a medical
review board 12 weeks from today.

1:39:04.222 --> 1:39:08.283
Then I will demonstrate that I am fit
to return to full diving duty.

1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:10.894
I want to make master chief.

1:39:13.698 --> 1:39:17.691
We admire your courage, chief,
however misplaced it may be.

1:39:17.902 --> 1:39:19.369
Please excuse us.

1:39:30.615 --> 1:39:32.412
I am a doctor, Carl.

1:39:32.750 --> 1:39:35.241
My opinion might mean something here.

1:39:39.023 --> 1:39:40.513
I guess not.

1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:44.921
How will you come back with one leg?

1:39:45.396 --> 1:39:47.387
I could barely read once.
I found a way.

1:39:50.935 --> 1:39:53.699
I could put up with the months
at sea...

1:39:54.672 --> 1:39:57.106
...the dangerous assignments
you never refused.

1:39:57.308 --> 1:39:59.276
- But this?
- What do you want from me?

1:40:00.678 --> 1:40:04.842
That I come home, mow the lawn,
put a wheelchair ramp in?

1:40:05.483 --> 1:40:08.884
- How am I gonna look at my son?
- Leave him out of this.

1:40:09.887 --> 1:40:14.017
You're not doing this for him or me.
This is about you.

1:40:14.458 --> 1:40:16.619
It's always been about you.

1:40:17.995 --> 1:40:19.553
Admit it, Carl.

1:40:20.598 --> 1:40:23.226
At least give me that much.

1:40:33.211 --> 1:40:35.645
Why are you doing this to me?

1:40:40.618 --> 1:40:42.210
Answer me, goddamn it!

1:40:42.653 --> 1:40:46.521
Or I'm walking out of here
and I am not coming back.

1:41:20.925 --> 1:41:22.415
I love you, Jo.

1:43:45.002 --> 1:43:47.095
Get away! Get away from me!

1:43:47.338 --> 1:43:48.669
Piece of shit!

1:43:50.741 --> 1:43:51.799
Cookie.

1:43:53.711 --> 1:43:57.203
Goddamn. Looks like I missed
one hell of a party.

1:44:03.921 --> 1:44:05.616
I've been all over.

1:44:06.157 --> 1:44:07.749
Trouble, mostly.

1:44:07.958 --> 1:44:11.587
Navy gave me a second-class diving
school in Little Creek.

1:44:11.796 --> 1:44:13.491
Don't amount to shit.

1:44:17.668 --> 1:44:19.499
I made some calls.

1:44:21.505 --> 1:44:23.166
On Friday, that Captain Hanks...

1:44:23.374 --> 1:44:26.935
...is convening a medical review board
and he's gonna retire you.

1:44:29.480 --> 1:44:32.210
- He said I had 4 weeks.
- He lied, Cookie.

1:44:32.550 --> 1:44:35.781
He don't care how many one-legged
pushups you can do.

1:44:35.986 --> 1:44:39.080
He'd trade you and me
and every other sea dog...

1:44:39.290 --> 1:44:41.758
...for one glass-eyed
electronics technician.

1:44:41.959 --> 1:44:43.893
The man's gonna retire your ass.

1:44:44.095 --> 1:44:45.892
My leg's back. I ain't done yet.

1:44:46.097 --> 1:44:49.555
You got a stump on a stick
and no chance of beating Hanks, son.

1:44:55.406 --> 1:44:59.467
- All I wanted was to be master diver.
- All I wanted was to stay one.

1:45:01.779 --> 1:45:04.441
You want to beat Hanks,
you got to go around him...

1:45:04.648 --> 1:45:06.240
...right to the top.

1:45:07.251 --> 1:45:08.240
Washington.

1:45:09.920 --> 1:45:12.980
- Chief of naval personnel.
- That's right.

1:45:13.757 --> 1:45:17.056
They don't like cocky pencil pushers
like Hanks any more than we do.

1:45:20.531 --> 1:45:22.556
I might be able to pull a few strings.

1:45:29.273 --> 1:45:31.241
Why are you doing this, Sunday?

1:45:34.845 --> 1:45:36.472
Piss people off.

1:45:37.114 --> 1:45:40.049
Chief Decker, you are
the chief master at arms...

1:45:40.251 --> 1:45:41.616
...of this hospital?

1:45:41.819 --> 1:45:42.786
Yes, sir.

1:45:45.055 --> 1:45:48.923
Then why is it you don't know
where Chief Brashear is?

1:45:49.660 --> 1:45:51.628
He shouldn't be too hard to spot.

1:45:51.829 --> 1:45:55.321
He's the only negro diver
in the Navy...

1:45:55.533 --> 1:45:57.194
...and he's got one leg.

1:45:57.735 --> 1:46:01.637
It seems that the chief
has transferred, sir.

1:46:03.340 --> 1:46:05.865
- On whose orders?
- He signed his own, sir.

1:46:07.778 --> 1:46:09.040
Call the shore patrol.

1:46:09.246 --> 1:46:11.305
Relax, cap. We just want to talk.

1:46:12.917 --> 1:46:14.009
Wait, wait, wait.

1:46:14.652 --> 1:46:16.984
You know where Chief Brashear is.
Where?

1:46:19.657 --> 1:46:21.716
I see. Fine.

1:46:21.926 --> 1:46:25.327
Chief Brashear is AWOL.
I want him found and arrested now.

1:46:25.529 --> 1:46:26.962
You ain't gonna find him.

1:46:28.299 --> 1:46:29.459
What do you want?

1:46:29.667 --> 1:46:33.398
Four weeks to train him,
then a reinstatement hearing...

1:46:33.604 --> 1:46:35.196
...with the chief of naval personnel.

1:46:36.106 --> 1:46:38.097
- The chief of...?
- Yes, sir.

1:46:38.309 --> 1:46:40.004
- In Washington?
- That's right.

1:46:40.544 --> 1:46:41.943
Forget it.

1:46:48.485 --> 1:46:51.420
- Will the diver be reinstated?
- Will he get a hearing?

1:46:51.622 --> 1:46:55.888
Seems Chief Brashear losing his leg
for his country makes him a hero, sir.

1:46:56.627 --> 1:46:57.719
Fine.

1:47:02.633 --> 1:47:04.760
I will grant you your hearing...

1:47:05.169 --> 1:47:06.568
...on one condition.

1:47:07.638 --> 1:47:10.505
When he fails, you retire.

1:47:11.108 --> 1:47:12.769
He ain't gonna fail.

1:47:58.522 --> 1:48:00.456
Minute five faster.

1:48:04.061 --> 1:48:05.494
See you in court.

1:49:42.993 --> 1:49:45.359
Captain Hanks ordered you
to remain here, chief.

1:50:11.655 --> 1:50:14.146
Please be seated,
Senior Chief Brashear.

1:50:20.164 --> 1:50:22.758
Only the Army salutes indoors,
senior chief.

1:50:22.966 --> 1:50:25.491
The Navy I grew up in
warrants a salute...

1:50:25.702 --> 1:50:27.567
...given the gravity
of this occasion.

1:50:27.771 --> 1:50:28.965
Well...

1:50:30.207 --> 1:50:31.970
...we're in a new Navy now.

1:50:38.115 --> 1:50:39.343
Shall we begin?

1:50:46.056 --> 1:50:48.616
Do you honestly feel that,
as a man...

1:50:51.695 --> 1:50:53.185
You're almost 40.

1:50:53.464 --> 1:50:55.329
You have one leg.

1:50:55.566 --> 1:50:59.229
Can you really keep up
with healthy divers half your age?

1:51:00.037 --> 1:51:01.868
The question is, sir:

1:51:02.272 --> 1:51:03.830
Can they keep up with me?

1:51:10.414 --> 1:51:11.745
No smoking, chief.

1:51:28.098 --> 1:51:32.626
Navy diving studies indicate that
if a subject were to become...

1:51:32.836 --> 1:51:35.464
...unconscious or deceased...

1:51:35.672 --> 1:51:39.768
...the disparity between the buoyancy
of a prosthetic...

1:51:39.977 --> 1:51:43.105
...and a limb would hinder him
in a free dive mode.

1:51:43.313 --> 1:51:46.840
You mean if he drowned,
he wouldn't float right, yes?

1:51:48.085 --> 1:51:51.646
Sirs, I promise
if I am killed at sea...

1:51:51.855 --> 1:51:54.483
...I will make every effort
to die like a Navy man.

1:52:20.651 --> 1:52:23.677
You should see the future
of Navy deep-sea diving.

1:52:23.887 --> 1:52:26.355
This is the latest He/O2,
mixed gas rig.

1:52:26.557 --> 1:52:28.149
It weighs 290 pounds.

1:52:28.358 --> 1:52:33.295
Men who want to use it, before
starting diving training, must walk...

1:52:33.530 --> 1:52:36.226
...twelve steps unassisted.

1:52:38.235 --> 1:52:40.703
Could you do that,
Senior Chief Brashear?

1:52:47.911 --> 1:52:49.071
Yes, sir, I could.

1:52:50.480 --> 1:52:51.469
Well...

1:52:51.815 --> 1:52:53.043
...I see.

1:52:53.850 --> 1:52:55.374
Much as I hate to prolong this...

1:52:55.586 --> 1:52:58.646
...in the interest of thoroughness,
I'll make arrangements...

1:52:58.855 --> 1:53:00.413
...for you to demonstrate.

1:53:00.624 --> 1:53:01.750
Here, sir.

1:53:02.359 --> 1:53:03.485
Now.

1:53:04.561 --> 1:53:07.394
Son, step aside,
or I'll crack you in the jaw.

1:53:10.934 --> 1:53:15.428
- This is hardly the appropriate venue.
- I want them all to see, sir.

1:53:16.306 --> 1:53:18.934
Captain, I concur
with your assessment.

1:53:23.380 --> 1:53:25.905
These slippery floors prohibit
a demonstration.

1:53:26.116 --> 1:53:28.482
Haven't you had enough career trouble?

1:53:29.086 --> 1:53:31.213
Your advice and presence
are unwelcome.

1:53:31.622 --> 1:53:34.557
- Who is this man?
- Chief Leslie W. Sunday, sir.

1:53:35.592 --> 1:53:39.119
You swam out of the <i>Saint Lo</i>
at Leyte Gulf.

1:53:40.864 --> 1:53:42.229
Held your breath for...

1:53:43.533 --> 1:53:45.398
...four minutes.
- Five, sir.

1:53:49.039 --> 1:53:50.131
He can stay.

1:53:52.776 --> 1:53:55.336
Fine. Irrelevant.

1:53:56.179 --> 1:53:59.410
Gentlemen, sirs, returning
to the issue at hand...

1:53:59.816 --> 1:54:03.809
...this is not the time or place
for Senior Chief Bra...

1:54:05.789 --> 1:54:08.451
Excuse me, senior chief.
Is there a problem?

1:54:12.496 --> 1:54:13.485
Captain Hanks...

1:54:14.665 --> 1:54:17.964
...I've spent my life in the Navy
trying only to succeed.

1:54:18.435 --> 1:54:21.927
But my quest has caused great
personal loss to those who love me.

1:54:22.606 --> 1:54:24.574
They too have made sacrifices.

1:54:24.775 --> 1:54:27.767
They too have endured
great pains to support me.

1:54:28.045 --> 1:54:30.536
If I walk these 12 steps today...

1:54:30.914 --> 1:54:33.178
...reinstate me to active duty.

1:54:33.717 --> 1:54:35.309
Give me my career back.

1:54:35.752 --> 1:54:39.017
Let me finish it,
and go home in peace.

1:54:42.125 --> 1:54:45.458
Senior Chief Brashear,
the business of the modern Navy...

1:54:45.662 --> 1:54:49.564
Forgive me, sir, but to me
the Navy is not a business.

1:54:49.866 --> 1:54:53.529
We have many traditions. In my
career, I've experienced most of them.

1:54:53.770 --> 1:54:56.238
Some good, some bad.

1:54:56.506 --> 1:55:00.306
However, I wouldn't be here today
if not for our greatest tradition.

1:55:01.545 --> 1:55:03.035
And which one is that?

1:55:04.648 --> 1:55:05.876
Honor, sir.

1:55:14.858 --> 1:55:17.258
Get on with it, senior chief.

1:55:20.831 --> 1:55:22.162
Leslie?

1:55:24.034 --> 1:55:25.558
What leg you got on?

1:55:26.103 --> 1:55:27.695
My walking leg...

1:55:27.904 --> 1:55:29.132
...Leslie.

1:55:29.339 --> 1:55:30.966
It was my dad's name.
Got a problem?

1:55:31.174 --> 1:55:33.665
Oh, no, no problem at all.

1:55:40.317 --> 1:55:43.411
That thing's light duty.
It'll snap like a matchstick.

1:55:43.620 --> 1:55:46.817
- I'll put my weight on my good leg.
- 290 pounds on one leg?

1:55:47.023 --> 1:55:50.015
You'll be passed out by the sixth step.

1:55:52.195 --> 1:55:54.425
Tenders, hat the diver.

1:56:44.047 --> 1:56:46.015
Navy diver, stand up.

1:56:48.018 --> 1:56:49.178
Leave him.

1:56:50.720 --> 1:56:55.248
Captain, if I recall Navy regulations,
the diver may be helped to his feet.

1:56:56.359 --> 1:56:59.089
It's a lot of brass to sling up
from a seated position.

1:56:59.763 --> 1:57:03.221
It's spun copper, chief.
We haven't used brass in a decade.

1:57:03.433 --> 1:57:06.925
The new manual states the diver
must rise unassisted.

1:57:07.137 --> 1:57:09.105
That's what it says in the new book?

1:57:10.674 --> 1:57:13.871
If I may ask, captain,
how would you know?

1:57:14.511 --> 1:57:15.705
I wrote it.

1:57:19.850 --> 1:57:21.249
Yes, sir.

1:57:26.690 --> 1:57:27.679
Navy diver...

1:57:27.891 --> 1:57:29.324
...stand up.

1:57:38.969 --> 1:57:41.631
Square that rig and approach the rail.

1:58:02.525 --> 1:58:03.549
One.

1:58:06.363 --> 1:58:07.421
Two.

1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:11.589
Three.

1:58:15.272 --> 1:58:16.261
Four.

1:58:19.576 --> 1:58:20.600
Five.

1:58:23.847 --> 1:58:24.836
Six.

1:58:26.883 --> 1:58:27.850
Seven.

1:58:31.054 --> 1:58:31.952
Eight.

1:58:37.894 --> 1:58:39.054
Gentlemen, his leg.

1:58:40.397 --> 1:58:41.455
Please.

1:58:42.599 --> 1:58:43.588
Gentlemen.

1:58:45.769 --> 1:58:48.738
- Navy diver, stand down.
- Diver, you will disregard.

1:58:49.072 --> 1:58:50.903
- This is my detail.
- Admiral?

1:58:53.376 --> 1:58:56.709
Goddamn it, Cookie, move your ass!
I want my 12.

1:59:08.758 --> 1:59:11.158
Nine. The Navy diver
is not a fighting man.

1:59:11.361 --> 1:59:13.386
He is a salvage expert.

1:59:14.230 --> 1:59:16.824
Ten. If it's lost underwater,
he finds it.

1:59:17.033 --> 1:59:18.625
If it's sunk, he brings it up.

1:59:18.835 --> 1:59:21.326
If it's in the way, he moves it.

1:59:21.738 --> 1:59:26.539
Eleven. If he's lucky, he'll die
young, 200 feet beneath the waves.

1:59:26.743 --> 1:59:29.678
For that is the closest
he will ever get to being a hero.

1:59:29.879 --> 1:59:33.076
Hell, I don't know why anyone
would want to be a Navy diver.

1:59:33.350 --> 1:59:35.978
Now you report to this line, Cookie.

1:59:40.590 --> 1:59:42.353
At ease.

1:59:55.505 --> 1:59:57.097
Tenders, unhat that diver.

2:00:19.829 --> 2:00:22.855
The United States Navy
proudly reinstates...

2:00:23.566 --> 2:00:25.295
...senior chief and diver...

2:00:26.169 --> 2:00:30.003
...Carl Brashear to full active duty.

2:00:50.160 --> 2:00:51.149
Thank you.

2:01:06.943 --> 2:01:08.308
I can quit.

2:01:08.912 --> 2:01:12.370
The man I married never quit anything
a day in his life.

2:01:16.653 --> 2:01:17.915
I love you.

2:01:18.121 --> 2:01:21.955
I love you too, baby.
I love you too.
