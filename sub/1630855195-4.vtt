WEBVTT

00:07.517 --> 00:08.965
The cops are searching boats,
okay?

00:09.034 --> 00:10.275
You need to dump the money
and the diamonds right now.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.827
I don't even fucking
know where she hid it.

00:11.896 --> 00:14.551
I have a warrant. We got
to search all boats in Balaki.

00:16.344 --> 00:18.103
What I wanna know is
where the fuck is my brother?

00:18.172 --> 00:19.310
Jesus Christ.

00:23.517 --> 00:25.241
Go, go, go.

00:25.310 --> 00:26.551
Fuck.
All right, just--

00:29.482 --> 00:30.931
I took it from Aaron's cabin.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.482
I don't know
what he's gonna do.

00:32.551 --> 00:34.000
Maybe he doesn't need
to find out.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.172
Where are they, then?

00:35.241 --> 00:36.310
Thought if
I could sell 'em fast,

00:36.379 --> 00:37.827
get a really good price--

00:37.896 --> 00:38.965
- Where are they now?
- They're gone!

00:39.034 --> 00:41.034
- What?
- I lost Denny's bag.

00:41.103 --> 00:42.034
Fuck!

00:44.758 --> 00:46.551
Miss, hold my hand!

00:46.620 --> 00:48.379
This is not a place
for tourist.

00:48.448 --> 00:50.068
- Kitty!
- Hey!

00:50.137 --> 00:51.103
Jump!

00:53.827 --> 00:55.206
It wasn't fucking drug money,

00:55.275 --> 00:58.000
it was a ransom paid
by a powerful Filipino family

00:58.068 --> 01:00.310
to get back their kidnapped son
from the BLF.

01:00.379 --> 01:02.655
There's a gentleman from
the Filipino police service.

01:16.655 --> 01:18.482
Figure we need
to put this in, too.

01:18.551 --> 01:19.689
Here.

01:22.896 --> 01:25.000
Shit!
I am so--fuck!

01:25.068 --> 01:27.793
It's heavy.
How do people do this?

01:27.862 --> 01:28.965
See you guys up there,
all right?

01:29.034 --> 01:30.172
Oh, could you--

01:34.206 --> 01:35.965
Thanks.

01:48.068 --> 01:50.000
Okay, I think we're all set.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.517
Okay.

01:51.586 --> 01:55.103
I think you should change.
You're a little bit saucy.

02:10.655 --> 02:12.034
Who's ready?

02:12.103 --> 02:14.965
- Raise the sail.
- Too low?

02:15.034 --> 02:17.724
No, that's...

02:19.724 --> 02:22.172
All right.
I'm starving.

02:27.896 --> 02:29.172
Could you pass, uh--

02:29.241 --> 02:31.034
I'm very impressed
by your cooking, Kitty.

02:31.103 --> 02:32.827
Oh, splendid.
All right.

02:32.896 --> 02:34.379
Where did you learn?

02:34.448 --> 02:37.344
Uh, just taught myself.

02:51.206 --> 02:53.586
I can't stop thinking
about that guy.

02:53.655 --> 02:56.413
Avaro?

02:56.482 --> 03:00.103
Yeah.
Me, too.

03:00.172 --> 03:02.310
Palau's not a very big place,
is it?

03:02.379 --> 03:04.793
No, not so big.

03:04.862 --> 03:07.448
So what if we can't
sell the diamonds there?

03:07.517 --> 03:10.655
Well, then,
we'll keep trying until we do.

03:10.724 --> 03:11.862
And the others,
they'll be okay?

03:11.931 --> 03:13.586
Yeah, they'll be fine.

03:13.655 --> 03:18.620
Once we're gone, I'll just
get back to island-hopping.

03:18.689 --> 03:21.275
Hey, what about Kitty?
You tell her?

03:21.344 --> 03:23.448
No.

03:23.517 --> 03:25.172
I think it's best
it's just between us for now.

03:25.241 --> 03:27.655
And then when we sell them,
I can--

03:27.724 --> 03:30.034
We'll disappear.
Somewhere safe.

03:30.103 --> 03:31.413
Kitty, too.

03:31.482 --> 03:35.448
And you and me,
we can be together properly.

03:35.517 --> 03:36.689
No more sneaking around.

03:38.275 --> 03:40.206
Yeah.

03:40.275 --> 03:43.655
But sneaking around's
half the fun.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.103
Yeah.

03:53.620 --> 03:55.344
Are we gonna
stop off somewhere?

03:55.413 --> 03:56.655
Pick up some supplies?

03:56.724 --> 03:58.034
There's a bit of weather
heading our way,

03:58.103 --> 04:00.068
so we might have to
wait that out for a bit.

04:00.137 --> 04:02.551
But as soon as it passes,
we should be safe to go.

04:02.620 --> 04:04.172
Ooh, looks good.

04:06.551 --> 04:07.931
Hey, hey.

04:08.000 --> 04:08.965
Hey.

04:24.344 --> 04:26.068
Smells good, Kitty.

04:43.103 --> 04:45.620
Look, I understand
you're pissed about yesterday.

04:45.689 --> 04:47.000
That's fair enough.

04:47.068 --> 04:48.655
The diamonds were all we had,
okay?

04:48.724 --> 04:49.724
And now, it's been for nothing.

04:49.793 --> 04:51.068
Sorry, you're still

04:51.137 --> 04:52.724
talking about
the fucking diamonds?

04:52.793 --> 04:56.620
When a innocent boy died?

04:56.689 --> 04:57.965
Because of our greed?

04:58.034 --> 04:59.689
Well, Joseph, you voted
to keep the bag as well.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.931
We all did.
No, no, Joseph's right.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.310
This situation is fucked up.

05:06.379 --> 05:11.275
Everything that went down
in Balaki, it is my fault.

05:11.344 --> 05:12.862
Okay?

05:12.931 --> 05:14.137
Taking the diamonds
out of Aaron's cabin,

05:14.206 --> 05:17.724
that was wrong, it was dumb,
and I'm sorry.

05:17.793 --> 05:19.206
Like, really sorry.

05:19.275 --> 05:21.551
And I know it'll take a while
to earn back your trust,

05:21.620 --> 05:23.551
so say the word and I'll do it.

05:23.620 --> 05:27.068
Fuck, Denny is always sorry,
he makes a big fuss about it,

05:27.137 --> 05:29.689
but then Denny keeps
doing whatever he likes.

05:29.758 --> 05:32.206
So you name a rule,
he's broken it.

05:32.275 --> 05:34.448
If anyone else
did half what he's done,

05:34.517 --> 05:36.206
you'd punish them.

05:36.275 --> 05:40.206
So where is Denny's
fucking punishment?

05:40.275 --> 05:43.655
Well, wait. I forgot
he's Aaron's little bitch.

05:43.724 --> 05:46.241
Hey, stop!

05:46.310 --> 05:48.965
- Stop, stop!
- Hey, stop!

05:49.034 --> 05:50.517
Hey, hey, hey!
No more, no more!

05:50.586 --> 05:52.344
Look, he's just upset
about what happened yesterday.

05:52.413 --> 05:53.896
Okay?

05:53.965 --> 05:56.793
And we were the ones that
saw that boy's fucking funeral.

05:56.862 --> 05:59.310
This will bring
on us all!

05:59.379 --> 06:01.206
- Cool down.
- Shut the fuck up.

06:01.275 --> 06:03.482
Gabber's bullshit, Joseph.

06:03.551 --> 06:07.103
fucking right under your nose?

06:07.172 --> 06:08.827
Stop, Joe.
This is embarrassing, man.

06:08.896 --> 06:11.068
I'm just saying the truth,
but no one wants to hear it.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.689
So what do you want, Joseph?

06:12.758 --> 06:14.689
You all know the penalty
for breaking the rules.

06:14.758 --> 06:16.517
Expulsion.

06:16.586 --> 06:18.827
We're about to
make an ocean crossing.

06:18.896 --> 06:20.896
We need Denny.
Why can't we vote?

06:20.965 --> 06:24.275
A vote? Yeah.

06:26.172 --> 06:28.241
It's a good idea.

06:28.310 --> 06:31.551
- Right.
- You must be joking.

06:31.620 --> 06:36.793
All those in favor
of Denny staying on board...

06:36.862 --> 06:38.758
come on.

06:51.586 --> 06:53.310
Denny can vote for himself?

06:53.379 --> 06:55.827
He's a member of the crew,
at least for now.

07:00.758 --> 07:04.000
All those in favor
of Denny leaving?

07:04.068 --> 07:06.068
Fuck you.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.137
Ricky--

07:14.206 --> 07:16.413
No, stop fucking
calling me that.

07:17.931 --> 07:20.896
So much fucking shit.

07:24.896 --> 07:25.965
Aaron decides it.

07:29.551 --> 07:32.827
It's the last chance, okay?
But it is your last one.

07:32.896 --> 07:36.206
What the fuck?

07:36.275 --> 07:37.793
You said you'd do
what's good for the boat.

07:37.862 --> 07:39.103
Denny has apologized.

07:39.172 --> 07:41.344
He's learned his lesson,
so that's enough.

07:41.413 --> 07:44.275
You like to think
you're such a tough leader,

07:44.344 --> 07:45.448
but you're weak.

07:45.517 --> 07:48.551
A weak fucking hypocrite!

07:51.413 --> 07:52.689
You're right, Joe,
you're right.

07:52.758 --> 07:53.931
I am weak.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.793
So I should toughen up.

07:55.862 --> 07:57.827
So how about
you get off my boat?

07:57.896 --> 07:59.482
Pack your shit up.

08:02.517 --> 08:04.172
I'm not the one to try
out here.

08:04.241 --> 08:06.275
No, someone like you, Joseph,
won't stop

08:06.344 --> 08:08.965
until you've turned each one
of us against each other

08:09.034 --> 08:11.448
and I'm not gonna
let that happen.

08:17.172 --> 08:19.482
Go pack your shit.
Come on, wait.

08:19.551 --> 08:21.586
Just wait.
Hey, Skipper?

08:21.655 --> 08:22.827
Yeah?

08:22.896 --> 08:26.034
There's a boat.
It's following us.

08:29.793 --> 08:31.758
You sure it's following?

08:34.379 --> 08:35.655
Maybe it's just fishermen.

08:35.724 --> 08:38.655
So a fishing boat, then,
whatever it is,

08:38.724 --> 08:40.689
is heading straight at us.

08:57.379 --> 09:01.137
♪ All the things
that I ran from ♪

09:01.206 --> 09:06.896
♪ I now bring as close
to me as I can ♪

09:06.965 --> 09:12.000
♪ Ripping hotel sheets
with gritted teeth ♪

09:12.068 --> 09:15.000
♪ My montage of lost things ♪

09:15.068 --> 09:20.241
♪ My shiny ♪

09:20.310 --> 09:23.724
♪ Trinkets of grief ♪

09:28.758 --> 09:32.172
What if it's those guys
from Balaki?

09:32.241 --> 09:34.103
All right, gloves on.
Get the jib down.

09:34.172 --> 09:36.103
Shell, on the wheel.
Get the motor up.

09:36.172 --> 09:38.172
Lana, over here.
Yeah.

09:38.241 --> 09:39.448
I want you to keep eyes
on them, okay?

09:39.517 --> 09:40.827
Anything changes,
you shout out.

09:40.896 --> 09:43.448
Shell, Kitty,
help the boys get that down.

09:43.517 --> 09:45.310
They're just making us
easier to spot.

09:45.379 --> 09:49.000
Go, come on!
Joe, go help them out.

09:49.068 --> 09:50.689
- What do I do?
- Denny, gloves.

09:50.758 --> 09:51.655
And weight 'em up.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.689
Hey, Aaron.

09:53.758 --> 09:55.620
Even at full throttle,
we can't outrun them.

09:55.689 --> 09:58.137
- Yeah, I know.
- All right, dump the sheet!

09:58.206 --> 10:00.896
Joe!
Dump the sheet!

10:02.482 --> 10:04.586
Joseph!
Yeah, yeah, okay!

10:04.655 --> 10:07.551
Rick, come on, come on!

10:07.620 --> 10:09.103
That's holding.

10:09.172 --> 10:11.310
Let's go, let's go!
Ready?

10:11.379 --> 10:13.103
Think I can see
where we might hide.

10:13.172 --> 10:15.137
Hide a yacht?
Where?

10:15.206 --> 10:17.137
Around the next island.

10:17.206 --> 10:20.068
- Let's go.
- Good.

10:20.137 --> 10:21.758
Yeah.

10:26.758 --> 10:27.931
- Speed her up!
- On it!

10:28.000 --> 10:31.758
Let's go!

10:37.689 --> 10:40.310
Put those on.

10:40.379 --> 10:42.034
All right, everyone!
Listen up!

10:42.103 --> 10:46.448
Gonna sail in chose, okay?
Behind that island over there!

10:46.517 --> 10:48.241
Shell, you're gonna
use it as a screen,

10:48.310 --> 10:50.862
hope they lose sight of us.

10:50.931 --> 10:52.965
I want everybody ready!

10:53.034 --> 10:55.310
Rick, get the fenders out!

10:55.379 --> 10:59.758
We'll be sailing very close
to those cliffs.

11:10.068 --> 11:11.965
I think it's those guys
from Balaki!

11:22.689 --> 11:25.758
Watch the depth here.
That tide is on its way out!

11:25.827 --> 11:26.965
Is this wise, bro?

11:27.034 --> 11:29.448
We run
aground, we're sitting ducks.

11:29.517 --> 11:31.103
Yeah, well, maybe
you should've thought of that

11:31.172 --> 11:35.482
before you led criminals right
to our front fucking door, bro.

11:41.310 --> 11:43.206
Hey, be careful!
It's worse over here.

11:43.275 --> 11:46.551
Easy.
A touch to port.

11:52.862 --> 11:54.241
Keep us straight, Shell.

11:54.310 --> 11:56.241
A bit more out from the tide,
yeah? It's strong.

12:28.965 --> 12:31.517
Got any more juice?
As fast as we can go. Come on.

12:31.586 --> 12:34.655
Skipper, over there!
I see an opening over there!

12:34.724 --> 12:36.620
See that, Cap?
That's the place!

12:36.689 --> 12:39.000
Okay, hard port!
Let's go! Come on!

12:39.068 --> 12:41.275
Lana!
Watching our rear?

12:41.344 --> 12:42.965
They see us go in there,
we'll be trapped!

12:43.034 --> 12:44.517
Yeah!
Got it!

12:44.586 --> 12:47.275
Heinrich, get ready, okay?
The tide is very low!

12:47.344 --> 12:48.482
There's gonna be rocks
fucking everywhere!

12:52.620 --> 12:58.241
Aaron, we won't
make it through there.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.551
Easy, easy.

13:02.620 --> 13:03.931
Okay, there's fuck-all depth
here, Shell.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.379
Just take it easy, okay?
I know. Fuck.

13:07.448 --> 13:09.379
A touch starboard.

13:09.448 --> 13:10.931
That's it, that's it.
You got it.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.103
Shit.
I don't think we're gonna fit.

13:15.379 --> 13:18.689
A little to starboard.
And again.

13:18.758 --> 13:19.793
Watch the bow!

13:19.862 --> 13:22.827
Oh, shit.

13:22.896 --> 13:24.344
I'm coming in closer.
Okay, okay.

13:24.413 --> 13:26.172
Good, good, good, good.

13:29.448 --> 13:31.413
Okay, Shell, a little bit
careful with the mast.

13:31.482 --> 13:33.068
- Whoa!
- Shell, it--

13:37.517 --> 13:39.413
Careful, Shell.
Okay, starboard, starboard!

13:39.482 --> 13:40.586
- Fuck.
- Careful!

13:40.655 --> 13:42.862
Fuck!

13:45.206 --> 13:46.586
We hit something up there?

13:46.655 --> 13:50.931
Shit, shit! Hell,
we're scraping the bottom!

13:52.344 --> 13:53.758
All right. We're gonna
go around starboard.

13:53.827 --> 13:55.620
Into the mangroves, okay?
Fuck.

13:55.689 --> 13:58.241
We're gonna tuck her in
over there out of sight.

14:11.586 --> 14:13.344
All right. Cut the engine.

14:13.413 --> 14:15.551
Everybody down, okay?
Stay quiet.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.551
Stay still.
Let's go.

15:06.103 --> 15:09.034
Shit.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.344
We need to get the fuck
off this boat.

16:04.482 --> 16:06.793
You've rung Kitty.

16:06.862 --> 16:09.793
Come on, did you really
expect me to pick up?

16:09.862 --> 16:12.413
Leave a message
and I'll call you back.

16:14.551 --> 16:16.896
Kit, I...

16:16.965 --> 16:21.551
I just wanted
to hear your voice.

17:35.206 --> 17:37.344
Chief Inspector.

17:37.413 --> 17:38.724
Colonel Reyes.

17:38.793 --> 17:41.034
Walking all over
my crime scene.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.482
Apologies.

17:42.551 --> 17:45.068
I wanted to see if you'd
looked at the De La Cruz file.

17:45.137 --> 17:46.275
Yeah.

17:46.344 --> 17:47.827
Rich kid murdered in Balakid

17:47.896 --> 17:50.896
with possible
organized crime involvement.

17:50.965 --> 17:53.827
And "The Blue" happened
to be in port at the same time.

17:53.896 --> 17:56.310
It's not exactly
a solid connection.

17:56.379 --> 17:59.724
Call it a hunch
that "The Blue" was involved.

17:59.793 --> 18:01.068
I hear there's a witness here

18:01.137 --> 18:02.620
that knows something
about their movements.

18:02.689 --> 18:03.793
If I could--

18:03.862 --> 18:05.344
Emma Anderson
is not a witness.

18:05.413 --> 18:06.620
She's just a kid, all right?

18:06.689 --> 18:08.689
She sailed with them a bit
six weeks ago.

18:08.758 --> 18:10.103
Repeating rumors.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.103
Still,
I'd like to speak with her.

18:12.172 --> 18:13.655
Colonel,
you're in Australia now,

18:13.724 --> 18:15.896
and this is my investigation.

18:15.965 --> 18:19.344
And I will decide
who talks to who.

18:19.413 --> 18:21.241
I don't think
you're telling me everything

18:21.310 --> 18:23.862
about that went on in Balakid,
so until you do,

18:23.931 --> 18:27.931
I'm going to ask you
to get off my crime scene.

18:36.862 --> 18:41.172
I need help.
Um--

18:41.241 --> 18:42.689
He disappeared.

18:42.758 --> 18:43.827
If you want to talk
to someone who's been arrested,

18:43.896 --> 18:45.413
come back in the morning, okay?

18:45.482 --> 18:46.931
But it's very serious.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.655
I-I'm worried.
I-I'm sorry my English--

18:50.724 --> 18:52.172
can somebody speak French?

18:52.241 --> 18:53.931
Please?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.241
Ah...

18:56.310 --> 18:58.586
You're Filipino?

19:32.724 --> 19:34.827
This here is by far

19:34.896 --> 19:36.482
the quickest route
out of the Philippines.

19:36.551 --> 19:41.172
Yeah, but we could be heading
right into a tropical storm.

19:41.241 --> 19:42.758
Right now,
it's just a life run,

19:42.827 --> 19:44.103
so a bit of luck,

19:44.172 --> 19:46.172
we sit on its shoulder,
we avoid the worst.

19:46.241 --> 19:49.655
And if we don't?

19:49.724 --> 19:52.379
We're the only ones who've ever
done an ocean crossing before,

19:52.448 --> 19:53.724
much less in a storm.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.275
What choice do I have?

19:55.344 --> 19:58.137
Wait here for them to come back
and slit our throats?

20:05.655 --> 20:08.413
There's an alternative.

20:08.482 --> 20:10.413
We could hand ourselves in.

20:10.482 --> 20:12.068
To the police.

20:19.793 --> 20:21.103
Okay, in case you forgot,

20:21.172 --> 20:23.689
there are two dead bodies
connected to this boat

20:23.758 --> 20:24.896
back in Balakid.

20:24.965 --> 20:26.379
- We didn't kill them.
- No, we didn't.

20:26.448 --> 20:28.793
But you think the Filipino cops
will see it that way?

20:28.862 --> 20:30.172
Shell,
that dead kid has family.

20:30.241 --> 20:31.586
They're rich,
they're fucking powerful.

20:31.655 --> 20:32.862
Yeah, well,
what if we explain

20:32.931 --> 20:34.172
that we didn't know
what we were doing?

20:34.241 --> 20:36.275
It's a coin toss.

20:36.344 --> 20:40.000
We lose, we do 20 fucking years
in a Filipino hellhole.

20:45.413 --> 20:47.103
So?

20:47.172 --> 20:50.482
So what?

20:50.551 --> 20:51.896
We need to get off this boat.

20:51.965 --> 20:54.551
Where?
We're in the middle of nowhere

20:54.620 --> 20:56.137
with no money and no passports.

20:56.206 --> 21:01.379
We just take our chances
like we always do, just us two.

21:01.448 --> 21:03.965
Is this seriously where we are
right now?

21:04.034 --> 21:05.758
You're just gonna hang
around on a boat

21:05.827 --> 21:07.448
'cause of fucking Denny?

21:07.517 --> 21:09.000
Is that what it is?

21:12.551 --> 21:14.827
Crew meeting upstairs.
Now.

21:21.931 --> 21:24.034
We need to stay here.

21:24.103 --> 21:27.034
- Why?
- Just trust me.

21:44.310 --> 21:47.655
So we lost 'em.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.068
For now.

21:50.137 --> 21:51.758
But they know we disappeared

21:51.827 --> 21:53.655
somewhere in this general area
of islands.

21:53.724 --> 21:54.586
- They'll be back.
- Yeah.

21:54.655 --> 21:56.137
So we need to set sail

21:56.206 --> 21:59.793
as soon as this tide comes up
a little more.

21:59.862 --> 22:02.827
I wanna head direct to Palau.
No more stops.

22:02.896 --> 22:04.241
But we hit rocks.
Shouldn't we be--

22:04.310 --> 22:06.000
Heinrich has located
the damage.

22:06.068 --> 22:08.793
He's fixing it.
Denny will help.

22:08.862 --> 22:10.206
While they're on that,

22:10.275 --> 22:13.551
I'm gonna re-plot us
a new course for Palau

22:13.620 --> 22:15.724
which will take us around
the worst of this storm.

22:15.793 --> 22:17.793
And me?

22:20.137 --> 22:24.620
You do just what I told you.
Get off my boat.

22:33.655 --> 22:35.034
Aaron.

22:35.103 --> 22:38.034
Charts show a village
just around this island.

22:38.103 --> 22:42.103
Shell, you take Joseph
from the tender.

22:42.172 --> 22:43.931
He can ask for help there.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.620
That's fucking bullshit.

22:46.689 --> 22:52.241
Anyone doesn't like it,
you're welcome to join him.

24:01.068 --> 24:05.344
Emma Anderson?

24:05.413 --> 24:07.931
Colonel Reyes,
Philippine Police Service.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.344
You're leaving, I see?

24:11.413 --> 24:12.482
No.

24:12.551 --> 24:15.724
I-I'm--
I just want to talk.

24:15.793 --> 24:18.620
Is there somewhere quiet?

24:18.689 --> 24:20.344
There's a theory that

24:20.413 --> 24:23.620
your friends on "The Blue" were
attacked by Filipino pirates,

24:23.689 --> 24:26.586
gangsters,
the Australian police saying

24:26.655 --> 24:29.620
maybe you know something.

24:29.689 --> 24:31.413
Only what I've heard.

24:31.482 --> 24:33.758
Any idea why
they might've been a target

24:33.827 --> 24:35.896
for something like that?

24:35.965 --> 24:39.310
Stuff happens over there,
right?

24:39.379 --> 24:42.758
Wealthy Westerners
sailing in the badlands.

24:42.827 --> 24:45.965
You don't seem wealthy.

24:46.034 --> 24:48.827
You must have felt
out of place.

24:48.896 --> 24:50.655
Mixing with
the yacht club crowd?

24:50.724 --> 24:52.827
I mean, it's not easy
being far away from home.

24:52.896 --> 24:55.172
Sorry, I just--

24:55.241 --> 24:59.068
I don't really get
why you're here.

24:59.137 --> 25:00.586
I've already
told the Australian police

25:00.655 --> 25:02.551
everything I know.

25:02.620 --> 25:04.379
In your conversations
with them,

25:04.448 --> 25:08.586
you never mentioned
Joseph Molina.

25:08.655 --> 25:11.551
He also sailed on "The Blue"
and he's also missing.

25:11.620 --> 25:14.000

at the church.

25:58.206 --> 26:01.689
We might get away from the
boat, but,

26:01.758 --> 26:04.034
you will never get away
from that.

26:07.275 --> 26:10.896
I can't go without her.

26:10.965 --> 26:13.758
Aaron will destroy you all.

26:17.310 --> 26:18.724
Someone has to tell Lana

27:34.241 --> 27:37.137
He planned to meet his sister
in Townsville,

27:37.206 --> 27:39.482
but never arrived.

27:39.551 --> 27:41.724
Maybe you sailed
on "The Blue" together?

27:43.517 --> 27:46.413
Uh, I mean maybe
we both sailed on "The Blue,"

27:46.482 --> 27:48.068
but not at the same time.

27:48.137 --> 27:50.206
- So you never met him?
- No.

27:50.275 --> 27:52.068
No chance
your paths might've crossed?

27:52.137 --> 27:55.103
No, no, no.
I told you no.

27:57.103 --> 28:00.965
Sorry,
I really wish I could help.

28:04.689 --> 28:08.827
Sometimes, Joseph sent photos
to his sister.

28:08.896 --> 28:11.275
You say you never met him?

28:11.344 --> 28:12.344
But I did.

28:12.413 --> 28:13.896
I met them both at a funeral

28:13.965 --> 28:17.137
of a boy whose death
I'm investigating.

28:17.206 --> 28:19.413
And now, you're here with them.

28:19.482 --> 28:23.068
How do you explain that?

28:50.413 --> 28:51.862
You always say
I should trust you.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.586
And I--I always do.

28:53.655 --> 28:54.862
After--

28:54.931 --> 28:56.103
We're almost
out of the Philippines.

28:56.172 --> 28:57.413
We're almost free.

28:57.482 --> 28:59.689
Are we?
'Cause I don't feel free.

29:01.724 --> 29:04.827
We're fucking trapped.
How is that my fault?

29:04.896 --> 29:06.482
Oh, my God. Why--

29:06.551 --> 29:08.482
you're just pissed off 'cause
I voted against your fuckbuddy.

29:08.551 --> 29:09.689
Do you know that
we would be fucked

29:09.758 --> 29:11.000
if it weren't for him
on this boat?

29:11.068 --> 29:12.931
I had to beg them
not to leave you in Balakid.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.586
I shouldn't have bothered.

29:16.241 --> 29:17.379
Do you know what?

29:17.448 --> 29:19.137
You take up so much space
all the time.

29:19.206 --> 29:20.482
You never even let me speak.

29:20.551 --> 29:22.241
Because you never
have anything to say!

29:22.310 --> 29:24.689
Maybe I would if I thought
that you would listen to me.

29:24.758 --> 29:26.827
No! You always run away
from your problems.

29:26.896 --> 29:29.724
You go quiet and weird and then
you bottle it all up.

29:29.793 --> 29:35.206
I had to do that
to survive her!

29:35.275 --> 29:38.137
Why can't you say her name?

29:38.206 --> 29:41.827
She was the one that took you
in when your mum left you.

29:41.896 --> 29:43.586
Why am I the only one

29:43.655 --> 29:47.344
who keeps having these
nightmares about what wedid?

29:47.413 --> 29:49.689
I feel fucking crazy.
No wonder.

29:49.758 --> 29:51.758
She was a fucking nightmare.
She was abusive.

29:51.827 --> 29:53.379
She treated me fine.

29:53.448 --> 29:56.241
It was you who brought that out
in her, and now she's gone.

29:56.310 --> 29:57.827
You can't even just
talk about it.

29:57.896 --> 30:00.241
What is wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?

30:00.310 --> 30:02.620
- Yes!
- Kitty, I'm not you!

30:02.689 --> 30:05.655
If she was so great,
if she loved you so much,

30:05.724 --> 30:07.689
then why are you so desperate?

30:07.758 --> 30:10.000
You throw yourself at everyone.
It's embarrassing.

30:10.068 --> 30:11.310
Oh, okay, go on,

30:11.379 --> 30:14.862
go and listen
to your druggie mum's music.

30:14.931 --> 30:16.862
Hey, you two.

30:16.931 --> 30:19.137
Aaron wants us on deck.

30:21.448 --> 30:23.517
All right, that tide is
as high as it's gonna get!

30:23.586 --> 30:25.689
Let's make our move now!

30:29.068 --> 30:32.827
Fucking hell.

30:36.241 --> 30:38.965
Tide's up.
We're moving out.

30:42.517 --> 30:44.517
I want everyone kitted up.

30:44.586 --> 30:47.586
Make sure everything
is securely stowed.

30:47.655 --> 30:49.241
It's gonna get very rough.

31:25.551 --> 31:29.896
Um, Aaron.
Is it safe to sail?

31:32.379 --> 31:36.413
Either way, Kitty,
we can't stay here.

31:36.482 --> 31:39.310
Stand and fight.

31:39.379 --> 31:40.724
Let's get moving!

31:40.793 --> 31:43.103
We need to make the most
of this high tide!

31:51.551 --> 31:54.448
Heinrich, take 'er up!

32:06.655 --> 32:07.896
I'm sure
there's a good reason

32:07.965 --> 32:10.137
why you're lying
to the search and rescue team.

32:10.206 --> 32:12.068
I'm not.
I'm not lying.

32:12.137 --> 32:14.551
And I mean--

32:14.620 --> 32:18.000
I don't think it's because
you're a bad person.

32:18.068 --> 32:19.448
I think you're scared.

32:27.586 --> 32:31.172
You don't trust me?

32:31.241 --> 32:34.655
Why would I?

32:34.724 --> 32:36.034
It's hard to know
who you can trust,

32:36.103 --> 32:37.965
so to prove to you
that I'm on your side,

32:38.034 --> 32:42.172
I'm not going to show this
photo to the Australian police.

32:42.241 --> 32:46.344
At least not yet.

32:46.413 --> 32:47.724
Is that a threat?

32:47.793 --> 32:50.379
Your friends in the photo,

32:50.448 --> 32:54.103
do you think
they're still alive?

32:54.172 --> 32:55.620
Because I do.

32:55.689 --> 32:58.689
In fact, I think you're the key
to solving this mystery.

32:58.758 --> 33:02.379
And maybe if we do, there's
still time to save them.

33:05.655 --> 33:08.448
I leave this with you.

33:10.655 --> 33:15.482
For when you're ready to talk.

33:56.344 --> 33:59.448
I thought you were trying
to avoid the storm!

34:03.931 --> 34:07.068
The starboard isn't cleared!

34:19.862 --> 34:23.517
Kitty!
I've been looking for you.

34:23.586 --> 34:24.793
- We're gonna die.
- Are you okay?

34:24.862 --> 34:27.551
- We're gonna die.
- No, no, we're not.

34:27.620 --> 34:29.103
- Oh, I shouldn't have come!
- Kitty!

34:29.172 --> 34:31.000
- I should've gone with Joseph!
- No, no, listen to me.

34:31.068 --> 34:32.241
Help!

34:32.310 --> 34:33.793
We're gonna be okay.

34:33.862 --> 34:37.620
But Kitty,
I want you to pull through.

34:37.689 --> 34:40.482
Okay.

34:40.551 --> 34:42.862
Help, help!
Get up here now!

34:51.620 --> 34:54.586
Kitty!

34:54.655 --> 34:56.000
Secure that!

34:56.068 --> 34:58.344
Heinrich,
make way for the anchor!

34:58.413 --> 34:59.724
Yeah!

35:00.517 --> 35:02.137
Be careful!

35:04.517 --> 35:06.448
Go ahead!
Put that on there!

35:16.931 --> 35:20.413
Aaron, are we okay?
The boat isn't built for this!

35:20.482 --> 35:22.310
Hang on!

35:43.068 --> 35:46.586
- Kitty, are you there?
- Lana!

35:46.655 --> 35:50.379
Oh, my God.
Are we sinking?

35:50.448 --> 35:52.758
Just go get help!

35:52.827 --> 35:56.172
Get help now!
Quick!

35:56.241 --> 35:57.448
Go!

36:02.931 --> 36:04.793
- Aaron!
- What?

36:04.862 --> 36:09.310
There's--there's--
there's water in your cabin!

36:09.379 --> 36:11.655
How come the bilge alarm
didn't go off?

36:11.724 --> 36:15.172
Maybe water
got in the wiring!

36:15.241 --> 36:17.827
Hey, Heinrich!
We're taking on water!

36:17.896 --> 36:20.758
- What?
- You told me you fixed it!

36:20.827 --> 36:22.586
Yeah,
put it in a storm like that,

36:22.655 --> 36:24.000
how could I know
it wouldn't hold?

36:24.068 --> 36:26.344
- I gave you one fucking job!
- Stop! Hey!

36:26.413 --> 36:28.758
It was your call to sail
into the storm, not his!

36:28.827 --> 36:31.241
Grab the wheel!

36:31.310 --> 36:33.000
Heinrich!

36:33.068 --> 36:34.689
Grab some
of that wooden sheeting

36:34.758 --> 36:36.310
from the seating up front!

36:38.241 --> 36:41.862
I'm gonna lead a line through
to you and Denny from below!

36:41.931 --> 36:45.586
Tie the port cord and
cut the line when you're ready!

36:53.344 --> 36:54.655
Shit.

36:56.482 --> 36:58.206
Oh, my God!

36:58.275 --> 36:59.793
All right, I know exactly
where it's coming from.

36:59.862 --> 37:01.551
Get this mattress off.

37:11.448 --> 37:13.137
Shit.

37:13.206 --> 37:14.551
Aw, shit!

37:42.655 --> 37:48.241
Kitty, give me those pillows!

37:48.310 --> 37:49.724
Gonna stem the flow!

37:49.793 --> 37:51.206
I need both of you!

37:51.275 --> 37:52.862
Put all your weight
down on here!

37:52.931 --> 37:53.862
- Come on!
- All right!

37:53.931 --> 37:56.000
Come on!

37:56.068 --> 37:59.896
Take that!
Hold it!

37:59.965 --> 38:01.379
Where are you going?

38:01.448 --> 38:03.862
Where are you going?
I'll be right back!

38:03.931 --> 38:05.551
Keep the pressure on!
Okay!

38:23.344 --> 38:24.413
Fuck!

38:24.482 --> 38:25.793
- You all right?
- Yeah!

38:25.862 --> 38:29.172
- Take my hand!
- Yeah!

38:29.241 --> 38:31.724
Oh, shit!

38:33.551 --> 38:35.724
Oh, fuck it.

38:41.655 --> 38:44.379
All right
Get ready!

38:51.275 --> 38:53.482
Fuck!

38:53.551 --> 38:55.000
Hey!

38:55.068 --> 38:56.206
All right, listen up!

38:56.275 --> 38:57.655
We're gonna work together now,
okay?

38:59.758 --> 39:02.275
Kitty, keep pressure on there.
But see this pump, all right?

39:02.344 --> 39:04.551
You're gonna
pump the water out, okay?

39:04.620 --> 39:06.103
Wait, wait, what?

39:06.172 --> 39:08.034
You need to roll
that pipe out,

39:08.103 --> 39:10.931
take it up on deck!
Okay!

39:15.137 --> 39:16.655
Oh, shit.

39:16.724 --> 39:19.551
We want any water
that we pump out to stay out!

39:19.620 --> 39:22.413
We need to try and
feed the rope through the hole!

39:22.482 --> 39:25.206
That's it, Kitty!
Good work, good work!

39:25.275 --> 39:28.620
Come on, Aaron!

39:35.034 --> 39:37.517
What the fuck are you doing?

39:37.586 --> 39:39.551
It'll bind up with the rope.

39:50.517 --> 39:52.241
Denny, left!

39:52.310 --> 39:53.896
Come on!

39:56.448 --> 39:57.862
Shit.

39:57.931 --> 40:00.103
Yes, got it!

40:00.172 --> 40:03.413
Come on, come on!

40:07.551 --> 40:09.000
Take it!

40:11.000 --> 40:13.448
What are you waiting for?

40:25.827 --> 40:28.068
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

40:30.310 --> 40:31.931
Okay.
Give 'em the signal!

40:32.000 --> 40:34.275
No, wait!

40:37.275 --> 40:39.551
Come on!

40:39.620 --> 40:41.551
He's got it!
Got it.

40:58.310 --> 41:01.793
Man overboard!

41:01.862 --> 41:06.034
Denny!

41:06.103 --> 41:07.379
I've got him!

41:17.241 --> 41:19.896
Got him!
Get Aaron up here!

41:26.103 --> 41:29.000
Aaron?
Heinrich's gone overboard!

41:29.068 --> 41:31.241
- Shit.
- Quick! We need help!

41:31.310 --> 41:32.965
Come on!

41:37.413 --> 41:39.517
Shit.

41:39.586 --> 41:41.413
You okay?

41:43.448 --> 41:45.068
Come on!

41:45.137 --> 41:47.068
- Hey!
- That side!

41:47.137 --> 41:49.655
Denny's got him!
Hey!

41:49.724 --> 41:51.689
Hold on!

41:51.758 --> 41:56.034
Come on!
Hey!

41:59.586 --> 42:01.827
My leg!

42:01.896 --> 42:03.206
You okay, mate?

42:03.275 --> 42:06.310
This is on you,
sailing into a fucking storm!

42:06.379 --> 42:09.655
You nearly killed him!
Didn't give you the signal.

42:09.724 --> 42:11.655
I felt a pull on the rope!

42:11.724 --> 42:14.344
You okay?
You'll live?

42:14.413 --> 42:16.068
Just my old tennis injury.

42:22.275 --> 42:25.000
I thought I was finished, yeah?

42:25.068 --> 42:27.758
I wasn't gonna let you
go out like that, bro.

42:27.827 --> 42:29.758
Not a chance!

42:34.413 --> 42:37.068
Here, let me do it.
I can do it.

42:41.344 --> 42:43.137
Thanks.

42:45.724 --> 42:49.965
I shouldn't have said that.
About your mum.

42:52.758 --> 42:54.689
It's no biggie.

44:51.517 --> 44:52.689
Denny?

44:55.172 --> 44:56.620
Can we talk?

44:58.620 --> 45:01.137
No. I've got to raise the
head, so...

45:01.206 --> 45:02.758
could you pass me that rope?

45:04.689 --> 45:05.655
Yeah.

45:10.310 --> 45:12.344
We can talk later.

45:18.103 --> 45:20.931
Black, no sugar?

45:21.000 --> 45:22.344
I'm good.

45:42.379 --> 45:45.137
Yeah?

45:51.793 --> 45:54.862
Uh...

45:54.931 --> 45:57.000
can I...

45:57.068 --> 45:59.758
can I sit here for a bit?

45:59.827 --> 46:02.172
Yeah, sure.

47:40.931 --> 47:45.793
Raise the sail.

48:21.310 --> 48:24.206
We really appreciate
your cooperation and respect

48:24.275 --> 48:25.827
in a very sensitive case

48:25.896 --> 48:28.724
that is still
very much ongoing.

48:28.793 --> 48:30.413
Once a statement
has been made...

48:34.413 --> 48:36.517
Emma.
Good timing.

48:36.586 --> 48:38.000
What's going on?

48:38.068 --> 48:40.068
Got a survivor.

48:40.137 --> 48:41.896
They want to see you.

48:43.758 --> 48:45.137
Case still ongoing, sir?

48:45.206 --> 48:48.275
Is there anything else
you can tell us, please?

48:53.034 --> 48:55.137
Through here.

48:55.206 --> 48:56.827
Give you two a moment.

49:26.206 --> 49:28.551
Denny.

49:32.103 --> 49:35.896
Is Kitty and the others,
are they...

49:39.724 --> 49:43.172
I couldn't stop it.

49:43.241 --> 49:45.827
I'm sorry.

49:52.310 --> 49:56.896
I'm sorry.

49:56.965 --> 49:59.482
They're all dead.
