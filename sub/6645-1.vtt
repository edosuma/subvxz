03:00.733 --> 03:02.860
Good morning, beauty.

03:05.822 --> 03:08.699
Let's go, or we'll never
leave on time.

03:09.659 --> 03:12.120
I'm totally ready.

03:12.703 --> 03:14.914
Come on. I'll make you some waffles.

03:15.123 --> 03:16.666
- Mother....
- Caitlin.

03:16.874 --> 03:18.709
Blueberries!

03:21.045 --> 03:22.296
Hey, Cooper.

03:22.547 --> 03:24.257
You want some breakfast too?

03:24.465 --> 03:25.967
You want some waffles?

03:26.175 --> 03:27.885
Good boy.

03:53.911 --> 03:56.038
Look. They're at it again.

03:56.330 --> 03:58.207
Christ, that's twice in....

03:58.416 --> 04:00.042
When did they move in?

04:00.251 --> 04:02.503
Three weeks. What's their name?

04:02.712 --> 04:06.591
Feur, I think. Psych department.
Figures, they're all nuts.

04:13.765 --> 04:15.725
She's awake.

04:16.934 --> 04:18.519
We'll be quiet.

04:18.810 --> 04:19.978
Quick and quiet.

04:20.813 --> 04:23.066
I don't want to be either.

04:26.486 --> 04:29.906
- When's she out of here?
- Norman Spencer!

04:30.364 --> 04:34.368
All right, I can't stand
the rejection. I'm going for a run.

04:35.578 --> 04:37.288
Hey, you okay?

04:37.914 --> 04:39.123
Yeah.

04:41.292 --> 04:43.127
Come on, Pooper. Let's go.

04:43.961 --> 04:47.131
We'll have to leave by 11
if we want to beat the traffic.

04:48.174 --> 04:49.967
Eleven o'clock.

05:16.702 --> 05:18.788
You know, you can call me...

05:18.996 --> 05:20.873
...whenever you want.

05:21.082 --> 05:22.917
Sweetheart...

05:23.251 --> 05:26.712
...I've known this day was coming
for a long time.

05:27.255 --> 05:29.882
I have Norman, and the garden
and the new house.

05:30.091 --> 05:31.801
You really don't have to worry.

05:32.009 --> 05:34.137
- I'm just saying--
- Really.

05:34.804 --> 05:35.847
Okay.

05:40.977 --> 05:42.311
Mom?

05:42.895 --> 05:43.980
Mom?

05:44.564 --> 05:45.773
Mother?

05:47.316 --> 05:49.026
I have to go.

05:52.822 --> 05:56.576
Honey, if I don't get you out of here
quick, they'll make you enroll.

05:56.826 --> 05:58.619
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

05:58.828 --> 06:00.496
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:01.038 --> 06:02.206
Come home often.

06:02.415 --> 06:03.750
Call your mom.

06:04.417 --> 06:06.294
- Beatrice, it's nice to meet you.
- Bye.

06:06.502 --> 06:10.089
- You take care of each other.
- I won't go to a bar without her.

06:10.298 --> 06:11.966
I'm just kidding.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.053
Bye.

06:21.851 --> 06:24.270
Well, I almost made it.

06:50.797 --> 06:52.131
What are you reading?

06:53.383 --> 06:56.469
"Genetic Repair Mechanisms
in Eukaryotic Organisms."

06:56.677 --> 06:58.930
Eukaryotic. How is it?

06:59.138 --> 07:00.807
Excellent.

07:01.349 --> 07:03.351
Oh, a couple of...

07:04.185 --> 07:08.815
...Swedish sailor cells just gang-
divided a virginal cheerleader cell.

07:12.860 --> 07:14.529
Almost there.

07:18.282 --> 07:22.245
- If you have to work....
- No, no. Just let me get this.

07:25.039 --> 07:26.916
Okay, almost.

07:28.167 --> 07:29.377
There.

07:30.753 --> 07:31.921
How's it going?

07:32.130 --> 07:34.716
Great. I think we cracked it.

07:35.341 --> 07:36.884
The prenatal thing?

07:37.093 --> 07:39.470
Yeah, I targeted repair.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.558
You are so brilliant.

07:44.684 --> 07:45.852
Yep.

07:46.060 --> 07:47.520
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk...

07:47.729 --> 07:49.188
...Norman Spencer.

07:49.439 --> 07:51.274
Yes!

07:54.360 --> 07:55.737
How are you?

07:55.945 --> 07:57.572
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

07:58.072 --> 08:00.450
I am. Yeah, really.

08:01.576 --> 08:03.745
It's okay if you're not, you know.

08:03.953 --> 08:06.247
To tell you the truth, I'm...

08:06.456 --> 08:08.082
...excited.

08:08.708 --> 08:09.959
Really?

08:10.168 --> 08:13.963
Yeah, I'm gonna get my life back.
Get some time for myself.

08:14.172 --> 08:16.174
Some time for us.

08:20.845 --> 08:22.555
Did a great job.

08:22.805 --> 08:24.474
She's a good kid.

08:24.766 --> 08:26.267
We did.

08:32.273 --> 08:34.107
Just us now.

08:35.485 --> 08:37.153
I know.

08:39.947 --> 08:41.282
Tired?

08:43.326 --> 08:44.577
Nope.

08:45.203 --> 08:47.747
Want to fool around?

08:48.456 --> 08:49.624
Yep.

09:15.650 --> 09:17.276
Jesus.

09:22.031 --> 09:24.534
What is he doing to her?

09:24.742 --> 09:26.953
- I guess they're making up.
- Wait.

09:27.662 --> 09:29.163
Leave it open.

09:31.457 --> 09:32.834
Think we can take 'em?

09:33.251 --> 09:34.335
It's worth a try.

09:48.933 --> 09:52.311
Do the brilliant Norman stuff
some more.

09:59.152 --> 10:01.070
And speak up.

12:02.567 --> 12:03.818
Oh.

13:11.135 --> 13:12.136
Hello?

13:16.474 --> 13:18.476
Ouch! Ow!

13:21.229 --> 13:22.271
Hello?

13:29.153 --> 13:30.530
Mrs. Feur?

13:35.868 --> 13:37.703
Hello?

13:38.913 --> 13:40.665
Are you all right?

13:46.045 --> 13:47.130
He's so....

13:47.964 --> 13:49.257
It's too much...

13:49.465 --> 13:51.467
...and I can't....

13:52.009 --> 13:54.095
I can't breathe.

13:54.846 --> 13:56.431
And I'm afraid.

13:56.639 --> 13:58.725
What? What are you afraid of?

13:58.933 --> 14:01.227
That one day I'll just...

14:01.436 --> 14:03.312
...disappear.

14:05.106 --> 14:07.316
Is there something I can do?

14:07.525 --> 14:08.651
Can I...?

14:09.694 --> 14:11.070
I've never even met you.

14:11.279 --> 14:12.905
I know. I'm sorry.

14:13.156 --> 14:14.115
I've been consumed.

14:15.241 --> 14:17.201
This fence...

14:17.952 --> 14:19.454
...it's so....

14:20.955 --> 14:24.959
I'm sorry. Listen, would you like
to come over for coffee, or--?

14:25.168 --> 14:26.919
Oh, God, he's back.

14:27.253 --> 14:29.922
I'm sorry. Please forget what I said.

14:30.131 --> 14:32.800
I don't even know you!
Please!

14:52.361 --> 14:53.738
She sounded...

14:53.946 --> 14:55.531
- ...terrified.
- Of what?

14:55.740 --> 14:57.408
Of him, I think.

14:57.617 --> 14:58.826
Did she say that?

14:59.035 --> 15:00.787
More or less.

15:01.704 --> 15:04.165
I want to go over there.
Let's go and--

15:04.373 --> 15:06.042
- Why?
- To see if she's all right--

15:06.250 --> 15:10.463
Honey, we're not going to march over
to our new neighbors and accuse them--

15:10.671 --> 15:15.176
- That's not what I'm suggesting.
- Especially since they'll keep us up...

15:15.385 --> 15:16.677
...with their sexual olympics.

15:16.886 --> 15:18.721
What if something happened to her?

15:18.971 --> 15:21.140
- Nothing will happen.
- I'd never forgive....

15:21.349 --> 15:24.018
Honey, people argue.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.020
People fight.

15:26.396 --> 15:29.107
It's not our business.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.953
- I've got to work tonight.
- I know.

15:43.955 --> 15:46.624
This conference is the first
big preview of my paper.

15:46.833 --> 15:49.544
I've just got to stay focused
a little while longer.

15:51.546 --> 15:53.589
This is what I've been working for.

15:53.881 --> 15:56.134
I just wish you could have heard her.

15:56.384 --> 15:57.844
I'll tell you what I'll do.

15:58.052 --> 16:01.097
I'll call Harvey Tomes tomorrow
in the psych department...

16:02.890 --> 16:05.226
...and I'll see what I can
find out about him.

16:05.435 --> 16:06.978
Promise?

16:07.270 --> 16:08.813
Yeah, I promise.

17:05.328 --> 17:06.329
Hey, lady!

17:06.871 --> 17:08.372
What are you doing?

17:08.915 --> 17:10.958
Looking for you.

17:12.417 --> 17:14.002
What are you doing?

17:14.462 --> 17:17.882
Just trying to drop off this
welcome thing for the new neighbors.

17:18.090 --> 17:19.133
Not home?

17:19.342 --> 17:20.635
Guess not.

17:20.885 --> 17:24.680
- You are so good at this.
- If I were, I'd have done it weeks ago.

17:24.888 --> 17:27.974
I gave my neighbors wine
that someone left at my house.

17:28.226 --> 17:31.229
- Are you staying?
- Just came by to see how you're doing.

17:31.437 --> 17:33.439
Good. I'm good.

17:34.232 --> 17:35.650
Are you?

17:37.235 --> 17:40.738
Why does everyone
find that so surprising?

17:40.947 --> 17:43.699
Because your only daughter
just left for college...

17:43.950 --> 17:46.077
...who you're extremely close with.

17:46.285 --> 17:47.620
I'd be tripping.

17:47.829 --> 17:48.830
Oh, right.

17:49.080 --> 17:52.667
You had a hell of a year too.
The move, the new house...

17:52.875 --> 17:53.876
...the garden.

17:54.085 --> 17:55.169
The car.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.255
A minor setback.

17:57.463 --> 17:58.631
Was that a year ago?

17:58.840 --> 18:00.174
This week.

18:00.383 --> 18:01.759
Wow. Now Caitlin.

18:01.968 --> 18:03.302
Big stress stuff.

18:03.511 --> 18:04.887
Okay.

18:05.179 --> 18:06.597
I'm a little tender.

18:06.806 --> 18:08.850
Good. You're human.

18:09.058 --> 18:12.729
And so far this week, my big task
is to take pictures of my roses...

18:12.979 --> 18:14.647
...for the garden club.

18:15.857 --> 18:18.401
Got here just in time, didn't I?

18:18.609 --> 18:20.194
Brought you something.

18:20.570 --> 18:22.363
It's Kambucha mushroom tea.

18:22.572 --> 18:25.366
It soothes heartache
and promotes psychic wellness.

18:25.575 --> 18:28.828
- Floriana suggested it.
- So you discuss me with your psychic?

18:29.036 --> 18:32.331
No, and she's not really a psychic.
Just an enlightened spirit.

18:32.540 --> 18:33.541
Like me.

18:33.750 --> 18:36.544
That's worse.
You're gossiping about me.

18:39.547 --> 18:41.340
Notice anything different?

18:41.549 --> 18:44.427
Oh, my God. You bought it!

18:44.635 --> 18:45.511
Yep.

18:45.720 --> 18:46.721
Nice.

18:46.929 --> 18:49.390
It's a beautiful thing, alimony.

18:49.599 --> 18:50.933
You lose a husband...

18:51.142 --> 18:52.643
...get a car.

18:52.852 --> 18:55.188
- Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
- Absolutely.

18:55.396 --> 18:56.564
Cool.

18:56.773 --> 18:58.858
I have to run. You take care.

18:59.275 --> 19:00.735
Thanks for the tea.

19:38.481 --> 19:39.899
Norman.

19:42.819 --> 19:44.153
Norman.

19:44.904 --> 19:45.947
- Norman!
- What?

19:46.155 --> 19:48.449
Come here. You have to see this.

19:53.246 --> 19:54.956
- What's the matter?
- Look.

19:59.544 --> 20:00.920
What, Claire?

20:03.214 --> 20:05.800
I thought I saw....

20:06.008 --> 20:08.136
- I--
- What?

20:08.344 --> 20:11.305
- I thought I saw something.
- Jesus Christ!

20:36.831 --> 20:38.082
Ow.

22:00.164 --> 22:02.041
Hi, is Caitlin there?

22:02.250 --> 22:04.877
Any idea when she'll be back?

22:08.464 --> 22:10.758
You be sure to tell her I called?

22:10.967 --> 22:12.593
Thanks, Beatrice.

22:14.804 --> 22:16.139
Well, that's a first.

22:16.848 --> 22:18.224
Cooper, come on.

22:18.433 --> 22:19.934
Get your ball.

22:21.477 --> 22:22.854
What's the matter?

22:24.188 --> 22:26.816
Cooper, it's your favorite ball.

23:06.814 --> 23:08.149
- Hello?
- Hi.

23:08.357 --> 23:11.527
I'm stuck here for another
couple of hours. Sorry.

23:11.986 --> 23:14.197
Unless you want me to come home?

23:15.490 --> 23:17.533
No. No, it's fine.

23:17.742 --> 23:19.077
You sure?

23:23.081 --> 23:24.290
Claire?

23:24.999 --> 23:26.000
Huh?

23:26.209 --> 23:28.461
Oh, absolutely. Take your time.

23:28.669 --> 23:30.129
See you soon. Love you.

23:30.338 --> 23:32.215
Love you. Bye.

23:40.681 --> 23:42.308
Cooper!

23:46.104 --> 23:48.106
Cooper!

23:54.153 --> 23:56.239
Fine. Have it your way.

24:51.210 --> 24:53.880
We use different kinds.
Now we're using halothane.

24:54.255 --> 24:56.424
Halothane? Is that a sedative?

24:56.632 --> 24:57.842
It's a dissociative.

24:58.051 --> 25:01.095
It paralyzes motor function
but leaves her conscious.

25:01.721 --> 25:04.057
She can't move
but knows what's going on.

25:04.265 --> 25:06.601
- Hi, Mrs. Spencer.
- Hi, Teddy.

25:07.852 --> 25:10.229
- How long does that last?
- Five minutes.

25:10.438 --> 25:13.024
- Sometimes three.
- Can it be used on all mammals?

25:13.232 --> 25:17.403
Yeah, any procedure where you want
to get the patient immobile, pain-free.

25:17.612 --> 25:18.446
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:18.654 --> 25:20.573
Hi. What are you doing here?

25:20.782 --> 25:21.949
- Are you okay?
- I....

25:23.284 --> 25:24.452
I heard noises.

25:24.702 --> 25:28.247
- What kind of noises? Where?
- At the house. I was scared.

25:28.456 --> 25:30.750
- Did you call the police?
- No.

25:31.292 --> 25:33.669
I'll have the police
check on the house while I'm gone.

25:33.878 --> 25:35.421
Oh, great.

25:35.630 --> 25:39.342
"Could you check in on my wife?
She's hearing voices."

25:39.550 --> 25:41.219
Wait till that gets around.

25:41.469 --> 25:44.806
I'll be in New Haven for the
conference. I want you to feel safe.

25:45.014 --> 25:46.349
I do.

25:46.557 --> 25:49.227
I'm sure it was just...

25:50.144 --> 25:51.646
...nothing.

25:53.231 --> 25:55.566
Did you call about the Feurs?

25:55.775 --> 25:57.652
Oh, yeah.

25:59.070 --> 26:01.781
Harvey says the guy's harmless.
Wouldn't hurt a flea.

26:01.989 --> 26:04.450
Warren. Warren Feur.

26:04.659 --> 26:06.452
What about her?

26:07.954 --> 26:09.747
I know he told me....

26:10.707 --> 26:11.958
Oh.

26:12.750 --> 26:14.836
I met Schumway today.

26:15.044 --> 26:17.255
Who wrote that book you love.

26:18.214 --> 26:21.134
They were doing some spiel
for the chemistry department...

26:21.342 --> 26:23.344
...so Bob Shine introduces us.

26:24.846 --> 26:27.181
You'll love this.
He looks right at me...

26:27.390 --> 26:29.892
...and congratulates me
on Spencer's Theorem.

26:30.601 --> 26:32.645
He didn't know your father was dead?

26:33.187 --> 26:34.188
He knew.

26:35.398 --> 26:37.442
Oh, Norman.

26:38.943 --> 26:40.278
What?

26:40.695 --> 26:42.780
You're so sensitive about that.

26:43.030 --> 26:44.282
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

26:44.490 --> 26:46.576
You always overreact.

26:49.162 --> 26:51.372
I'll have to watch that, won't I?

27:00.757 --> 27:02.341
Was it Mary?

27:02.550 --> 27:03.760
Mrs. Feur.

27:03.968 --> 27:06.429
Warren and Mary?

27:07.930 --> 27:09.015
Yeah.

27:09.223 --> 27:10.767
Mary. That's it.

27:12.477 --> 27:14.187
I'm gonna do some work.

28:52.660 --> 28:54.078
Hello?

28:54.996 --> 28:56.706
Mrs. Feur?

30:12.698 --> 30:14.409
Can I help you?

30:14.826 --> 30:16.619
Oh, yes.

30:17.078 --> 30:19.247
Hi.

30:20.123 --> 30:23.000
I'm Claire Spencer, from next door.

30:24.085 --> 30:25.086
Nice to meet you.

30:25.336 --> 30:28.923
I wanted to stop by and welcome you
to the neighborhood.

30:32.176 --> 30:35.805
Thank you, but this really isn't
a good time. I'm running late.

30:36.639 --> 30:38.099
Is your wife home?

30:39.976 --> 30:40.935
No, she isn't.

30:42.103 --> 30:44.147
When will she be back?

30:45.148 --> 30:46.315
I have to go.

30:46.524 --> 30:49.277
I'm sorry. It was nice to meet you.

30:58.619 --> 30:59.579
What's he doing?

30:59.787 --> 31:00.872
Eating dinner.

31:01.080 --> 31:02.290
Alone.

31:02.874 --> 31:04.375
TV dinner.

31:04.625 --> 31:06.002
That's bad.

31:07.628 --> 31:08.921
That's my shiatsu guy.

31:09.130 --> 31:13.051
Listen, call me back if he starts in
on some serial-killer dessert...

31:13.259 --> 31:15.053
...like ladyfingers.

31:15.511 --> 31:17.597
- You got it.
- Bye.

31:20.558 --> 31:21.559
Where did you go?

31:59.430 --> 32:00.932
Shit!

33:12.170 --> 33:14.130
Jesus, Claire.

33:14.338 --> 33:16.257
- What the hell are you doing?
- I was looking--

33:16.466 --> 33:18.259
- Spying.
- Spying on Mr. Feur.

33:18.468 --> 33:20.386
- How come you're not dressed?
- Dressed?

33:20.595 --> 33:22.513
Dinner with Stan.

33:22.722 --> 33:24.557
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

33:24.766 --> 33:27.685
- We're going to be--
- Fashionably five minutes late.

33:28.102 --> 33:29.854
Are you saying he murdered his wife?

33:30.063 --> 33:32.148
Is that so ridiculous?
She was terrified...

33:32.356 --> 33:35.610
...and now she doesn't answer
the door, but her car's in the garage.

33:35.860 --> 33:38.488
Maybe she was out,
or in bed with the flu.

33:38.696 --> 33:41.866
- Or maybe she was abducted by aliens.
- Who are you calling?

33:42.116 --> 33:45.453
- Restaurant.
- We're not at the center of the bridge.

33:45.661 --> 33:47.705
You can't get service
until the center.

33:47.914 --> 33:50.416
I know we're not at the center.

33:51.959 --> 33:54.128
There. See?

33:54.962 --> 33:57.006
Well, that's a relief.

33:57.215 --> 33:58.216
Hi, Stan.

33:58.424 --> 34:00.802
Hey, Claire. Norman.

34:01.010 --> 34:03.096
- Sorry we're late.
- It's my fault.

34:03.304 --> 34:04.430
We just got here.

34:04.639 --> 34:07.225
- Where's the new squeeze?
- Here I am.

34:07.433 --> 34:08.935
- This is--
- Elena?

34:09.185 --> 34:10.603
Oh, my God. Claire!

34:10.812 --> 34:12.813
I don't believe it!

34:14.607 --> 34:16.818
- This is--
- We know each other.

34:17.025 --> 34:19.487
- Norman.
- Hello, Norman. How do you do?

34:19.695 --> 34:21.072
Claire, look at you!

34:21.280 --> 34:22.864
You look beautiful.

34:23.241 --> 34:27.786
Here was this brilliant conductor
in purple bikini briefs...

34:28.036 --> 34:30.331
...with no bangs...

34:31.833 --> 34:35.002
...cursing his ass off in Finnish.

34:35.712 --> 34:37.213
Oh, Claire.

34:38.589 --> 34:39.799
I made an honest woman of her.

34:40.007 --> 34:42.342
How long have you been in Vermont?

34:42.592 --> 34:44.512
Oh, well, Norman grew up here.

34:44.762 --> 34:49.684
Remember Beau Flynn, head of cardio
at the hospital? He was just sacked.

34:49.934 --> 34:52.186
I just dropped her off at college.

34:52.395 --> 34:55.690
He was involved in some stalking
incident. An intern, some girl.

34:55.898 --> 34:57.233
We're getting so old!

34:57.442 --> 35:00.445
They don't screw around
with that anymore.

35:00.653 --> 35:05.032
- When did we last get together?
- New York.

35:05.241 --> 35:08.036
- Of course. Right after--
- Right after Michael died.

35:08.244 --> 35:09.704
- Michael who?
- Marlov.

35:09.912 --> 35:11.622
Claire's first husband.

35:11.831 --> 35:13.541
- Oh, the musician.
- Yeah.

35:13.791 --> 35:15.710
You know, we all toured together.

35:17.253 --> 35:19.005
Have you heard her play?

35:19.213 --> 35:20.506
No.

35:21.549 --> 35:23.092
No, I....

35:23.301 --> 35:26.220
I would sit on-stage...

35:26.471 --> 35:29.599
...during Claire's solo...

35:29.807 --> 35:33.895
...and I mean, truly, I had tears
streaming down my face.

35:34.395 --> 35:36.189
I mean, she's fabulous.

35:36.397 --> 35:38.066
So why did you stop?

35:38.775 --> 35:40.193
Oh....

35:40.985 --> 35:43.654
Well, one night, after a concert...

35:43.863 --> 35:47.408
...I met a dashing, handsome...

35:47.992 --> 35:50.661
...genius scientist...

35:50.870 --> 35:54.707
...and three months later,
I was married.

35:55.583 --> 35:59.545
Is that when you guys
moved up to Vermont?

35:59.796 --> 36:02.965
No, we were living in Boston...

36:03.174 --> 36:05.385
...when Norman was offered a position.

36:05.593 --> 36:06.886
A position.

36:07.136 --> 36:09.764
The DuPont Chair in genetics.

36:11.140 --> 36:14.560
I see. So now you're teaching
at your father's school here.

36:14.769 --> 36:16.479
I actually don't...

36:16.687 --> 36:18.523
...do much teaching anymore.

36:18.731 --> 36:20.775
I run a research project.

36:21.234 --> 36:22.485
Oh.

36:25.905 --> 36:29.200
Norman's father had this old stuffy--

36:29.409 --> 36:32.286
--stately place on a lake.

36:32.495 --> 36:35.289
- Which we're renovating.
- Practically gutted.

36:35.498 --> 36:36.958
- No, we didn't.
- Yes, we did.

36:37.208 --> 36:38.167
"Gutted."

36:38.418 --> 36:43.089
- Wait till you see it. It's beautiful.
- It is beautiful. You'll see it.

36:43.673 --> 36:45.091
It's haunted.

36:45.717 --> 36:46.718
No.

36:46.926 --> 36:48.010
Is it really?

36:48.219 --> 36:50.138
Claire's hearing things.

36:50.805 --> 36:52.890
What? What are you hearing?

36:58.187 --> 36:59.439
I, um....

36:59.647 --> 37:01.774
I don't know. I heard...

37:01.983 --> 37:04.360
...voices, whispering....

37:05.111 --> 37:06.612
A picture fell.

37:06.821 --> 37:10.324
You know, I completely believe
in all that.

37:11.117 --> 37:12.118
You do?

37:12.326 --> 37:13.327
I do.

37:13.536 --> 37:15.913
Wait a minute.
Who do you think it is?

37:17.540 --> 37:19.709
I know exactly who it is.

37:21.169 --> 37:22.920
It's my old man.

37:23.254 --> 37:26.007
He's pissed about us
dicking around with the house.

37:55.703 --> 37:56.954
Ow.

40:39.409 --> 40:40.535
Claire.

40:41.202 --> 40:42.412
Jesus....

40:43.329 --> 40:44.580
It's all right.

40:45.873 --> 40:47.667
Calm down, Claire.

40:47.875 --> 40:49.585
It's okay.

40:59.721 --> 41:01.097
Whose idea was it?

41:01.305 --> 41:02.890
Mine. His.

41:03.099 --> 41:05.017
We both thought....

41:06.144 --> 41:08.104
I didn't want to come here.

41:08.396 --> 41:10.732
- Then why did you?
- He was worried about me.

41:10.940 --> 41:12.358
- Your husband?
- Yes.

41:12.608 --> 41:16.571
I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me
full of Prozac or lithium...

41:16.821 --> 41:18.823
...so he can live out his life
in peace.

41:19.031 --> 41:21.034
- Do you really think so?
- No.

41:21.242 --> 41:22.785
Are you on medication?

41:23.036 --> 41:25.705
No. Well, Valium.

41:25.913 --> 41:27.248
For sleeping.

41:27.457 --> 41:28.875
Having trouble sleeping?

41:29.083 --> 41:30.585
Sometimes.

41:30.793 --> 41:32.420
When I get anxious.

41:32.628 --> 41:35.590
Do you get anxious only at night?

41:37.050 --> 41:39.218
No, I only take Valium at night.

41:39.427 --> 41:40.928
For sleeping.

41:42.430 --> 41:44.182
Why do you get anxious?

41:45.099 --> 41:46.350
I don't know.

41:46.726 --> 41:49.103
Why do you think
your husband's worried?

41:49.312 --> 41:51.105
Because....

41:52.565 --> 41:53.941
I don't know.

41:54.942 --> 41:58.362
Because ever since Caitlin left--

41:58.571 --> 42:01.616
Ever since my daughter left
for school...

42:02.283 --> 42:04.202
...there have been....

42:06.454 --> 42:07.872
I've been....

42:08.081 --> 42:10.166
Why is this so hard?

42:11.751 --> 42:13.503
Here. Have a fireball.

42:17.006 --> 42:18.758
Thank you.

42:19.717 --> 42:22.220
It's hard because I'm
a complete stranger...

42:22.470 --> 42:25.348
...and you're talking about
incredibly personal things.

42:25.556 --> 42:30.103
Besides, most people, when they
come the first time, are wondering...

42:30.853 --> 42:32.980
...if I think they're crazy.

42:33.648 --> 42:35.608
Don't worry. I'm required...

42:35.817 --> 42:38.403
...to have three sessions
before I can commit.

42:40.405 --> 42:41.989
That was a joke.

42:50.957 --> 42:53.418
These are good. They're hot.

42:55.586 --> 42:57.296
There's a ghost in my house.

43:01.551 --> 43:03.594
I saw her in the water, beside me...

43:03.803 --> 43:05.012
...in the bathtub.

43:05.555 --> 43:06.848
What does she look like?

43:09.350 --> 43:11.102
She looked like...

43:11.352 --> 43:12.478
...me.

43:14.647 --> 43:15.565
Oh.

43:15.773 --> 43:18.109
Only she had green eyes.

43:19.026 --> 43:20.820
Any idea who she is?

43:22.071 --> 43:25.283
Maybe. But I'd rather not say
just yet.

43:25.491 --> 43:26.701
Fine.

43:34.542 --> 43:36.127
What do you think I should do?

43:36.627 --> 43:37.670
Try to contact her.

43:38.254 --> 43:42.341
Communicate with her somehow.
Find out what she wants.

43:43.676 --> 43:47.221
What do you want me to do?
Go buy a Ouija board?

43:49.849 --> 43:51.476
Ah.

43:53.269 --> 43:55.980
Are we hoping the ghost
will have to use the potty?

43:56.230 --> 43:57.648
This is where she was.

43:57.857 --> 43:59.025
This is where I...

43:59.233 --> 44:00.234
...saw her.

44:00.485 --> 44:01.861
That makes sense.

44:02.070 --> 44:04.781
- Where did you finally find one?
- Kmart.

44:05.198 --> 44:09.369
I think we're supposed to sit
in a protective circle, aren't we?

44:09.577 --> 44:10.578
What's that for?

44:12.038 --> 44:13.915
- Where did you get it?
- Never mind.

44:14.582 --> 44:16.084
You stole her shoe.

44:16.334 --> 44:19.712
You have to have something
of the dead woman's.

44:19.921 --> 44:20.838
Says who?

44:21.923 --> 44:23.174
Is that blood on it?

44:23.424 --> 44:27.553
I don't know. Just place your fingers
on the message indicator.

44:27.929 --> 44:29.680
Okay.

44:40.441 --> 44:42.443
We wish to commune...

44:42.652 --> 44:44.070
...with the spirit--

44:46.155 --> 44:47.490
What?

44:47.907 --> 44:49.283
"Wish to commune."

44:50.118 --> 44:51.244
- Forget it.
- What?

44:51.494 --> 44:53.830
No, this whole thing is insane.

44:54.038 --> 44:55.206
I'm sorry.

44:55.832 --> 44:57.709
What's her first name?

45:00.336 --> 45:01.587
Mary.

45:03.131 --> 45:04.173
Feur.

45:05.883 --> 45:08.553
Mary Feur, Mary Feur....

45:09.429 --> 45:11.556
Mary Feur....

45:12.974 --> 45:15.143
We wish to communicate...

45:15.810 --> 45:18.730
...with the spirit of Mary Feur.

45:25.945 --> 45:28.114
- Not much happening.
- Shh.

46:00.438 --> 46:01.481
What was that?

46:03.524 --> 46:04.984
It's flickering.

46:07.028 --> 46:08.196
Yeah.

46:28.549 --> 46:30.343
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

47:04.919 --> 47:06.087
Cooper!

47:07.755 --> 47:08.756
Listen...

47:09.298 --> 47:11.718
...about our little sÃ©ance.

47:12.260 --> 47:13.803
Norman doesn't need to know.

47:14.595 --> 47:16.931
- I won't tell if you won't.
- It's just that...

47:17.223 --> 47:20.101
...ever since the accident...

47:20.309 --> 47:22.228
...he treats me like I'm this...

47:22.437 --> 47:25.022
...fragile, loopy....

47:25.898 --> 47:28.651
Well, I am seeing ghosts
in the bathtub, aren't I?

47:28.901 --> 47:32.113
You did wrap your car around a tree
doing, like, 80.

47:33.322 --> 47:34.949
He was pretty shaken up.

47:35.158 --> 47:38.369
- We all were.
- It was an accident. A year ago.

47:38.578 --> 47:40.538
I'm fine.

47:41.289 --> 47:42.540
Right?

47:45.835 --> 47:47.837
Of course you are.

47:49.547 --> 47:52.717
You're just not much of a medium,
however.

47:53.593 --> 47:55.261
I'll call you tomorrow.

47:55.470 --> 47:56.637
Get some rest.

47:56.846 --> 47:58.639
Did you pick up any dudes yet?

47:59.182 --> 48:00.767
I have one in the trunk.

48:04.145 --> 48:05.396
Bye.

50:34.420 --> 50:36.422
What do you want?

51:12.500 --> 51:13.918
She's dead.

51:14.168 --> 51:16.838
- Who's dead?
- You know damn well who's dead.

51:17.046 --> 51:18.047
The Feur thing.

51:18.297 --> 51:19.257
Listen to me.

51:19.465 --> 51:21.801
He killed her and I'm not crazy.

51:22.009 --> 51:25.680
Jody and I had a sÃ©ance in the
bathroom, and nothing happened...

51:25.888 --> 51:29.392
...but when I went back there
she was there. She was.

51:30.226 --> 51:31.477
Wait a minute.

51:31.686 --> 51:34.188
You had a sÃ©ance?

51:37.066 --> 51:39.485
- Are you angry with me?
- What?

51:41.070 --> 51:44.282
- Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
- No.

51:45.074 --> 51:49.245
You know what I've got at stake for
this paper. How important it is to me.

51:49.454 --> 51:53.291
I can't help feeling that you're
trying to sabotage me, to hurt me.

51:53.499 --> 51:55.376
Norman, this isn't about you.

51:55.585 --> 51:57.503
Something is happening to me.

51:57.712 --> 52:02.508
And it's not to get even, and it's
not some warped bid for attention.

52:02.717 --> 52:07.388
Something is happening in our house,
whether you like it or not.

52:09.932 --> 52:11.100
Claire.

52:12.226 --> 52:13.561
Claire, stop.

52:13.770 --> 52:14.937
You're overreacting.

52:15.146 --> 52:17.023
Don't tell me how to react.

52:17.231 --> 52:19.942
- Will you keep your voice down?
- I will not!

52:20.151 --> 52:21.319
Maybe you're right.

52:21.527 --> 52:23.404
Maybe I am losing my mind.

52:23.613 --> 52:25.281
But what if I'm not?

52:25.490 --> 52:27.116
What if she died...

52:27.325 --> 52:28.534
...some horrible death?

52:28.743 --> 52:30.620
Can we please not do this here?

52:30.912 --> 52:32.538
Oh, wow.

52:37.877 --> 52:39.087
You.

52:39.379 --> 52:41.297
You think you're smart, don't you?

52:41.506 --> 52:43.132
You think you got away with it.

52:43.341 --> 52:47.220
Well, I know you killed her,
you murdering son of a bitch!

52:47.428 --> 52:48.388
Who?

52:48.596 --> 52:50.098
Don't give me that shit.

52:50.306 --> 52:52.141
Your wife.

52:53.017 --> 52:55.311
She's very upset. Forgive us, please.

52:55.520 --> 52:56.646
Honey.

52:58.147 --> 53:00.149
I didn't kill my wife.

53:01.526 --> 53:03.069
Are you all right?

53:05.571 --> 53:07.115
Come on, honey.

53:09.701 --> 53:11.661
Come on. Let's go.

53:12.537 --> 53:13.579
I'm sorry.

53:22.880 --> 53:23.881
You all right?

53:24.090 --> 53:25.258
Oh. Yeah.

53:25.508 --> 53:27.009
I'm fine.

53:27.885 --> 53:29.637
What happened? Just now?

53:29.846 --> 53:32.974
I just saw Norman's face.

53:34.934 --> 53:38.062
He was so frightened for me.

53:38.271 --> 53:39.564
How's your marriage?

53:41.190 --> 53:43.484
Good. Really good.

53:44.193 --> 53:46.946
We've had our moments, I guess...

53:47.155 --> 53:50.324
...but he's a wonderful husband
and father.

53:50.950 --> 53:54.162
I mean, sure, he can be obsessed
with his work...

53:54.370 --> 53:56.831
...and sometimes it's like...

53:59.042 --> 54:01.335
...that he doesn't see me.

54:01.544 --> 54:03.796
Or, you know...

54:04.005 --> 54:05.673
...like I'm....

54:07.383 --> 54:09.927
That there's something wrong...

54:11.095 --> 54:12.263
...with me.

54:14.640 --> 54:16.017
That can't feel good.

54:16.726 --> 54:18.227
No.

54:25.860 --> 54:26.944
Okay.

54:27.195 --> 54:30.239
I see where you're going with this...

54:30.448 --> 54:33.409
...but my marriage is fine. No.

54:33.618 --> 54:37.997
I have had some kind of
empty-nest episode...

54:38.206 --> 54:40.833
...where I saw...

54:41.042 --> 54:44.003
...some things that weren't there.

54:45.588 --> 54:49.092
Let's deal with that.
I'm willing to deal with that.

55:17.537 --> 55:20.915
"Thought you might need this.
Love, Jody."

55:21.374 --> 55:23.000
Uh-oh.

55:40.852 --> 55:42.603
Mrs. Spencer.

55:43.938 --> 55:48.234
I wanted to apologize
for scaring you like I did.

55:48.443 --> 55:50.778
When I thought about
how it must have seemed--

55:50.987 --> 55:53.698
Please. Let's just....

55:57.827 --> 55:59.328
Claire Spencer.

55:59.537 --> 56:01.247
Mary Feur.

56:01.456 --> 56:04.667
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Very much.

56:06.044 --> 56:07.253
That day at the fence...

56:07.462 --> 56:09.839
...you seemed terrified.

56:10.465 --> 56:12.842
I don't think I imagined that.

56:13.092 --> 56:14.385
No.

56:15.344 --> 56:17.263
What were you so afraid of?

56:19.348 --> 56:23.811
Have you ever felt so completely
consumed by a feeling for someone...

56:24.062 --> 56:26.773
...that you couldn't breathe?

56:27.774 --> 56:30.443
Thought that your time together
was so...

56:30.651 --> 56:34.697
...passionate and consuming that you
felt physical pain when they'd leave?

56:36.240 --> 56:37.158
Um....

56:37.408 --> 56:38.368
Sure.

56:38.659 --> 56:40.536
I couldn't catch my breath...

56:40.995 --> 56:42.205
...and I panicked.

56:42.997 --> 56:45.458
I never dreamed anyone would hear me.

56:47.126 --> 56:48.961
I tried to leave him.

56:49.796 --> 56:52.465
I went to my mother's in Providence...

56:52.924 --> 56:54.467
...but he brought my things up...

56:54.717 --> 56:56.928
...in the middle of the night...

56:57.345 --> 56:59.055
...during the rainstorm.

56:59.263 --> 57:01.599
He pleaded with me to come home.

57:02.100 --> 57:03.559
You must think I'm pathetic.

57:03.810 --> 57:05.436
No.

57:06.938 --> 57:08.231
I don't.

57:09.524 --> 57:13.903
I'll be quick. I've got to get Sidon
to okay my budget before his trip.

57:14.153 --> 57:16.572
What's Templeton's wife's name again?

57:16.823 --> 57:18.866
Lois. Phil and Lois Templeton.

57:19.117 --> 57:22.620
Don't let her corner you,
she'll chew your ear off.

57:22.912 --> 57:24.372
- Evening, Phil.
- Here they are.

57:24.622 --> 57:25.832
How do you do? Hi.

57:26.082 --> 57:29.168
Hi. Nice to see you again, Lois.

58:20.261 --> 58:21.888
White wine, please.

58:27.560 --> 58:29.020
How are you holding up?

58:29.312 --> 58:31.856
Just fine. It's a lovely party.

58:32.732 --> 58:35.276
Norman was telling me the house
is finished.

58:35.526 --> 58:37.695
- Almost.
- Wonderful.

58:38.071 --> 58:40.531
It's good to see you doing so well.

58:40.948 --> 58:41.908
Thank you.

58:42.158 --> 58:44.494
Well, I was worried.

58:44.827 --> 58:48.873
I don't think I've seen you since
Norman's reception here last year.

58:49.082 --> 58:50.792
You were worried?

58:52.001 --> 58:56.214
I swear, I've become that nosy old lady
I used to run away from at Amherst.

58:56.422 --> 58:58.800
No, I'm just not sure what you mean.

59:00.093 --> 59:02.678
You got so upset.

59:03.888 --> 59:05.431
Oh, at the party.

59:05.723 --> 59:07.809
For the DuPont Chair.

59:08.059 --> 59:09.352
You remember?

59:09.685 --> 59:12.188
Well, I remember the party, but....

59:14.565 --> 59:16.192
Oh, God!

59:18.069 --> 59:20.738
I had completely forgotten.

59:21.197 --> 59:22.573
I broke your crystal.

59:22.782 --> 59:23.991
Oh, my dear.

59:24.242 --> 59:26.994
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.

59:27.578 --> 59:30.790
But you went completely pale.
You couldn't catch your breath.

59:31.040 --> 59:33.960
It was as if you had seen a ghost.

01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:20.882
"Missing girl."

01:00:24.385 --> 01:00:27.472
Madison Elizabeth.

01:00:29.682 --> 01:00:31.225
M-E.

01:00:44.989 --> 01:00:45.990
Frank.

01:00:46.824 --> 01:00:49.118
Madison Elizabeth...

01:00:50.328 --> 01:00:51.329
...Frank.

01:00:53.831 --> 01:00:56.000
M-E-F.

01:01:33.329 --> 01:01:34.414
Claire?

01:01:36.958 --> 01:01:39.502
Hey, good morning.

01:01:43.339 --> 01:01:44.340
Up all night?

01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:45.425
Mm-hm.

01:01:45.675 --> 01:01:46.592
You okay?

01:01:53.891 --> 01:01:55.518
Do you remember this?

01:02:02.775 --> 01:02:05.236
It's the girl that disappeared
last year.

01:02:07.572 --> 01:02:08.823
Did you know her?

01:02:09.449 --> 01:02:10.366
No.

01:02:18.207 --> 01:02:20.251
Claire, I'm afraid to ask.

01:02:21.961 --> 01:02:23.755
Where's all this going?

01:02:25.048 --> 01:02:26.049
It's her.

01:02:28.009 --> 01:02:30.762
The woman I saw in the bathtub.

01:02:31.012 --> 01:02:32.472
- The ghost?
- Yes, the ghost.

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.557
I thought it was Mrs. Feur,
but it's not.

01:02:34.807 --> 01:02:36.350
I'm positive this time.

01:02:36.601 --> 01:02:38.061
Claire, stop it!

01:02:38.895 --> 01:02:40.271
Stop it.

01:02:43.107 --> 01:02:46.194
I know you're going through something
I don't understand.

01:02:48.404 --> 01:02:51.574
I have tried to be here for you,
but this is enough, Claire.

01:02:51.824 --> 01:02:53.117
Enough.

01:02:54.452 --> 01:02:56.829
Do you want to go see somebody
together?

01:02:57.163 --> 01:02:58.956
I'll call Dr. Drayton.

01:03:01.709 --> 01:03:04.045
Then what, Claire? What?

01:03:04.295 --> 01:03:06.339
Tell me what to do.

01:03:07.256 --> 01:03:08.508
It's her.

01:03:11.177 --> 01:03:13.596
So let me ask you this....
Mr. McCain?

01:03:13.888 --> 01:03:15.765
- McCann.
- McCann.

01:03:17.308 --> 01:03:21.604
Nothing was ever found?
No car, or...?

01:03:21.813 --> 01:03:25.149
Listen....
This girl's a real live wire.

01:03:25.441 --> 01:03:29.487
She drives around in a souped-up
Mustang convertible.

01:03:29.737 --> 01:03:31.197
Most people think she's...

01:03:31.447 --> 01:03:35.410
...off around Mexico or somewhere
with her friends.

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:38.955
The police downgraded it to a runaway.

01:03:41.082 --> 01:03:44.085
Her mother lives out here
in Addison County.

01:03:45.753 --> 01:03:48.256
- Mrs. Frank?
- Yeah?

01:03:49.173 --> 01:03:51.134
I'm Claire.

01:03:52.635 --> 01:03:55.638
I wanted to talk to you about Madison.

01:03:56.013 --> 01:03:58.099
Just plain coffee.

01:03:58.808 --> 01:04:01.978
- None of that mocha nonsense.
- Fine.

01:04:04.021 --> 01:04:06.441
You look a little old for a student.

01:04:06.691 --> 01:04:10.361
I'm not a student. We met at a party.

01:04:11.112 --> 01:04:13.614
Well, that sounds about right.

01:04:14.198 --> 01:04:17.910
I never understood how a girl
that wild got all A's.

01:04:18.161 --> 01:04:20.163
She liked to read a lot, though.

01:04:20.413 --> 01:04:24.333
Sometimes she'd lock herself up
in her room for days, just reading.

01:04:25.918 --> 01:04:30.423
They wanted to put her in a school
for the gifted when she was young.

01:04:31.299 --> 01:04:33.509
Maddie wouldn't hear about it.

01:04:34.469 --> 01:04:37.555
I don't know where she got it.
She didn't get it from me.

01:04:38.723 --> 01:04:41.976
She probably got it
from her father's side of the family.

01:04:44.771 --> 01:04:46.898
She never really mentioned her father.

01:04:48.232 --> 01:04:49.859
Yeah, well, she wouldn't.

01:04:51.152 --> 01:04:52.862
She was 12 when he left.

01:04:53.112 --> 01:04:55.365
Never spoke about him after that.

01:04:57.867 --> 01:04:59.494
You don't even need the sound.

01:05:01.913 --> 01:05:04.916
You can pretty much tell
what's happening by the faces.

01:05:06.876 --> 01:05:09.128
I turn it up sometimes, though.

01:05:09.879 --> 01:05:12.048
Feels like there's someone here.

01:05:15.551 --> 01:05:17.011
Why are you here?

01:05:23.768 --> 01:05:24.894
I don't know.

01:05:26.729 --> 01:05:28.439
You want to see her room?

01:05:39.492 --> 01:05:41.119
Full scholarship.

01:05:41.786 --> 01:05:43.329
Princeton too.

01:05:44.539 --> 01:05:46.874
She wanted to stay on the East Coast.

01:05:48.084 --> 01:05:50.253
You must be so proud.

01:05:54.674 --> 01:05:57.427
These are the last pictures
taken of her.

01:05:58.261 --> 01:06:00.263
The police used this one.

01:06:01.973 --> 01:06:03.933
Let me get that. Excuse me.

01:07:24.597 --> 01:07:25.765
Claire?

01:07:48.579 --> 01:07:49.664
Claire?

01:08:05.847 --> 01:08:09.976
- Hello, Dr. Spencer.
- Mrs. Spencer.

01:08:12.687 --> 01:08:14.147
Forbidden fruit.

01:08:17.649 --> 01:08:19.736
You got a problem with that?

01:09:12.705 --> 01:09:15.625
Guess this means you're not
mad at me anymore, huh?

01:09:16.125 --> 01:09:17.835
I wouldn't go that far.

01:10:02.422 --> 01:10:04.048
Ow.

01:10:06.426 --> 01:10:08.469
Take it easy, huh?

01:10:14.142 --> 01:10:15.852
What's got into you?

01:10:20.606 --> 01:10:22.984
- Ow!
- What's the matter?

01:10:23.901 --> 01:10:25.153
It's too rough.

01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:27.113
Since when?

01:10:32.744 --> 01:10:34.203
This is a brand-new--

01:10:34.412 --> 01:10:35.705
Shh.

01:10:47.258 --> 01:10:51.095
- Okay, Claire, that's--
- Why don't you shut up, professor?

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.724
Why don't you just...

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.393
...shut up?

01:12:15.263 --> 01:12:17.932
I think she's starting
to suspect something.

01:12:18.599 --> 01:12:19.642
Who?

01:12:22.729 --> 01:12:23.646
Your wife.

01:12:25.481 --> 01:12:26.315
Stop it!

01:12:39.871 --> 01:12:41.039
You know.

01:12:41.581 --> 01:12:42.832
What the hell are you doing?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.376
I know.

01:12:49.047 --> 01:12:50.590
I was there.

01:12:53.593 --> 01:12:55.720
Just before the accident.

01:12:57.138 --> 01:12:58.306
I remember now.

01:12:59.265 --> 01:13:00.266
What?

01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:02.727
I came to the door.

01:13:04.103 --> 01:13:05.646
There was whispering.

01:13:05.855 --> 01:13:08.775
I saw you in the mirror...

01:13:11.736 --> 01:13:14.405
...lying there with her...

01:13:14.614 --> 01:13:15.823
...in our house.

01:13:16.074 --> 01:13:17.950
Claire, listen to me.

01:13:18.159 --> 01:13:19.702
She was at the DuPont party...

01:13:19.911 --> 01:13:22.330
...staring at me. It was her.

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:24.207
That's why I couldn't breathe.

01:13:24.457 --> 01:13:26.709
That's why I dropped the glass.

01:13:26.959 --> 01:13:29.629
Honey, that was last year.
We were having troubles.

01:13:30.254 --> 01:13:32.715
So you slept with a fucking student?

01:13:32.965 --> 01:13:35.635
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Don't touch me.

01:13:36.469 --> 01:13:37.595
Get away from me.

01:13:39.889 --> 01:13:41.349
Get out!

01:13:42.517 --> 01:13:44.060
I said, get out!

01:13:46.145 --> 01:13:47.063
Fine.

01:13:48.731 --> 01:13:50.274
Claire, please, please.

01:13:50.733 --> 01:13:52.568
I gave up everything.

01:13:52.819 --> 01:13:54.612
Claire, please don't....

01:13:55.279 --> 01:13:58.199
- My life, my music.
- I never asked you to quit.

01:13:58.449 --> 01:14:00.702
There was never any other choice!

01:14:00.952 --> 01:14:04.247
You had to topple perfect daddy.
That meant perfect wife.

01:14:04.539 --> 01:14:06.624
- Perfect family.
- That's not fair.

01:14:06.874 --> 01:14:08.584
You were touring with a baby...

01:14:08.835 --> 01:14:10.795
...and you were happy to give it up.

01:14:11.045 --> 01:14:14.132
When you did, you hated me for it,
so you gave it all to her.

01:14:14.382 --> 01:14:15.675
- Who?
- Caitlin!

01:14:15.967 --> 01:14:16.926
Leave her out of this.

01:14:17.176 --> 01:14:20.430
And then some bright
young woman finds me attractive.

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.515
- Stop it!
- And I slipped!

01:14:22.765 --> 01:14:24.934
- God help me, I slipped!
- I'm not gonna listen.

01:14:25.184 --> 01:14:29.772
- Claire, I tried to break it off.
- You should've tried harder.

01:14:38.072 --> 01:14:39.949
I was in Adamant.

01:14:41.159 --> 01:14:42.201
In Adamant?

01:14:42.452 --> 01:14:46.497
You know, that artsy little hippie
village a couple hours away down on 7.

01:14:46.748 --> 01:14:51.294
I stopped at this cafÃ© to get coffee,
and I see Norman sitting in the back.

01:14:51.544 --> 01:14:52.837
But he wasn't alone.

01:14:54.255 --> 01:14:56.299
It was a young blond woman.

01:14:57.091 --> 01:14:58.718
I didn't see her face.

01:14:59.218 --> 01:15:01.012
I didn't think anything of it
at first.

01:15:01.262 --> 01:15:03.723
And I was walking over to say hello.

01:15:06.684 --> 01:15:09.979
And they started arguing
in such a way...

01:15:11.522 --> 01:15:13.316
...that it stopped me.

01:15:14.692 --> 01:15:18.196
Then a few days later,
you were in the accident.

01:15:18.446 --> 01:15:21.866
And I get a bizarre call from Stan
working at the hospital...

01:15:22.116 --> 01:15:24.535
...asking me, was I with you that day?

01:15:24.827 --> 01:15:26.537
If you were upset about anything.

01:15:26.746 --> 01:15:29.582
He made it sound
like you had deliberately...

01:15:29.832 --> 01:15:31.292
...driven your car into a tree.

01:15:31.542 --> 01:15:33.628
And I thought, "Oh, my God.

01:15:33.878 --> 01:15:36.714
Claire's found out."

01:15:36.964 --> 01:15:41.719
And when I went to the hospital,
I see Norman.

01:15:44.931 --> 01:15:48.267
And he was so desperate
at the thought...

01:15:51.062 --> 01:15:52.939
...of losing you.

01:15:54.482 --> 01:15:57.068
I couldn't say anything.

01:15:59.570 --> 01:16:01.114
Please...

01:16:04.158 --> 01:16:06.035
...don't hate me, Claire.

01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:08.913
I don't hate you.

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.211
Hello, this is Miss Jody.

01:16:15.461 --> 01:16:19.590
Can't get to the phone. Leave your
name and I'll call you back.

01:16:20.133 --> 01:16:21.676
Jody, it's Norman.

01:16:23.094 --> 01:16:25.138
I'm looking for Claire.
Will you please...

01:16:26.597 --> 01:16:28.474
...ask her to call home, please?

01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:35.106
I can't talk to him.

01:16:37.567 --> 01:16:40.653
Will you call and tell him
I'll be home in the morning?

01:16:43.281 --> 01:16:45.408
I have to ask him something.

01:17:08.306 --> 01:17:09.599
Norman?

01:17:40.546 --> 01:17:41.756
Norman?

01:17:45.343 --> 01:17:46.886
Norman!

01:17:49.889 --> 01:17:51.265
Oh, God!

01:17:52.225 --> 01:17:53.142
Norman!

01:17:53.518 --> 01:17:55.687
- How's his blood pressure?
- 140/80.

01:17:55.978 --> 01:17:59.399
- How about his rhythm?
- Rhythm is normal. Normal sinus.

01:17:59.649 --> 01:18:01.442
- No sign of arrhythmia.
- Good.

01:18:01.651 --> 01:18:04.112
Pulse/ox is normal.
His pupils were equal.

01:18:04.404 --> 01:18:06.114
I'd still like to take you down.

01:18:06.406 --> 01:18:07.782
I'm fine, really.

01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:11.828
Dr. Powell, I'd recommend
a cardiac workup.

01:18:12.286 --> 01:18:16.249
- I'll take care of that.
- He needs to sign the release form.

01:18:16.499 --> 01:18:18.126
Thanks, guys.

01:18:18.376 --> 01:18:22.088
They can take you for a CAT scan
tomorrow if you start feeling dizzy.

01:18:22.338 --> 01:18:24.132
I'm not going to the hospital...

01:18:24.382 --> 01:18:26.968
...unless they have
a miracle drug for clumsiness.

01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:29.053
Honey, I'm so sorry.

01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:31.264
Thank God you came home.

01:18:31.556 --> 01:18:33.099
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:18:33.349 --> 01:18:35.768
You know, if that breaker
hadn't popped, he....

01:18:36.019 --> 01:18:37.186
I know.

01:18:38.479 --> 01:18:39.772
Yeah, don't worry, Claire.

01:18:40.023 --> 01:18:43.026
You just keep him quiet tonight, okay?

01:18:43.276 --> 01:18:47.071
You might want to think twice
about keeping anything electrical...

01:18:47.321 --> 01:18:49.699
- ...next to the tub.
- Oh, thank you.

01:18:51.325 --> 01:18:53.411
Goodbye. Call me, okay?

01:19:26.027 --> 01:19:29.238
I called you last night.
I left a message on Jody's machine.

01:19:31.616 --> 01:19:33.993
I want you to answer one question.

01:19:36.913 --> 01:19:40.833
Did you have anything to do
with her disappearance?

01:19:42.585 --> 01:19:43.503
Yes.

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:50.093
I had an affair with her.

01:19:52.887 --> 01:19:55.139
And when I tried to break it off...

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.975
...she became unstable.

01:20:00.645 --> 01:20:02.939
She came out here to the house.

01:20:04.649 --> 01:20:06.734
She threatened to kill herself...

01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:10.780
...or you.

01:20:13.449 --> 01:20:16.786
I didn't think she'd
go through with any of it.

01:20:18.287 --> 01:20:19.664
But then she....

01:20:21.499 --> 01:20:23.209
She disappeared.

01:20:27.004 --> 01:20:28.464
It was her, Norman.

01:20:28.715 --> 01:20:30.174
She tried to kill you.

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.427
- Claire.
- You said it yourself.

01:20:32.677 --> 01:20:34.303
She wanted you dead.

01:20:34.595 --> 01:20:37.682
Are you saying I was attacked
by a ghost?

01:20:38.099 --> 01:20:40.768
You had an affair with a girl...

01:20:40.977 --> 01:20:45.815
...who threatened to kill herself, and
now there's a presence in our house.

01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:49.402
A young, blond girl.

01:20:50.194 --> 01:20:51.654
Don't you get it?

01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:53.823
She did it, Norman.

01:20:54.115 --> 01:20:55.366
She's dead...

01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:58.536
...and now she's trying to hurt you
or both of us.

01:20:58.786 --> 01:21:01.372
- You don't know that she's dead.
- Of course we do!

01:21:01.664 --> 01:21:04.083
It's the only thing that makes--

01:21:06.878 --> 01:21:08.171
Oh, God.

01:21:09.630 --> 01:21:11.966
It's my fault. I....

01:21:12.592 --> 01:21:14.052
I opened the door.

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:17.805
- Madison. I stole her hair.
- From where?

01:21:18.056 --> 01:21:20.183
- And it gave her power.
- Claire.

01:21:21.267 --> 01:21:24.812
Nothing attacked me.
There are no ghosts.

01:21:25.563 --> 01:21:28.107
It was an accident. I'm fine.

01:21:28.566 --> 01:21:31.652
It's not your fault.
Are you listening to me?

01:21:32.278 --> 01:21:34.489
- Yes.
- Claire, say it.

01:21:34.739 --> 01:21:37.825
Say it:
"It was an accident.

01:21:38.117 --> 01:21:39.660
It's not my fault."

01:21:41.287 --> 01:21:42.997
Say it, Claire.

01:21:43.915 --> 01:21:46.292
I need to go lie down.

01:21:46.584 --> 01:21:50.088
I didn't sleep last night,
and I need to lie down.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:55.051
I want to be alone for a while.

01:22:15.655 --> 01:22:18.116
Hey, Teddy, it's me.
Right, yeah.

01:22:18.366 --> 01:22:22.412
What's the name of that friend of
yours? That who-you-gonna-call guy?

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:25.957
The guy that does the paranormal
psych stuff?

01:22:26.290 --> 01:22:27.834
Holodnik.

01:22:29.502 --> 01:22:32.880
Could you contact him and ask him
to give me a call here?

01:22:33.131 --> 01:22:35.967
I'd really like to talk to him today.

01:23:47.413 --> 01:23:48.498
Hello.

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:50.833
Yes, this is he.

01:23:51.042 --> 01:23:52.919
Thanks for calling back.

01:23:54.837 --> 01:23:58.591
No, sir. That was my father.

01:24:01.469 --> 01:24:03.930
Yeah, he passed away
a couple of years ago.

01:24:05.348 --> 01:24:07.058
Yes, he was. Thank you.

01:24:08.267 --> 01:24:10.812
Look, the reason I'm calling is....

01:24:11.062 --> 01:24:13.815
I'm a little out of my depth here.

01:24:14.023 --> 01:24:17.193
Someone who is very close to me...

01:24:17.443 --> 01:24:20.196
...believes herself to be
or seems to be...

01:24:20.446 --> 01:24:22.448
...in contact with some kind of...

01:24:23.199 --> 01:24:25.660
...entity or spirit, and--

01:24:28.913 --> 01:24:31.374
No, there's no...

01:24:31.624 --> 01:24:34.001
...no history of delusional behavior.

01:24:37.171 --> 01:24:41.718
Well, I guess what I'm asking is,
is it possible that she could be...

01:24:41.926 --> 01:24:45.012
...causing these manifestations...

01:24:45.263 --> 01:24:50.184
...through some kind of unconscious
or telekinetic--?

01:24:52.687 --> 01:24:53.855
Uh-huh.

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:58.067
Is there anything else
that it could be?

01:25:04.741 --> 01:25:07.118
And this has been documented?

01:25:10.455 --> 01:25:11.497
Really?

01:25:14.417 --> 01:25:16.878
I'm sorry,
but could I call you back...

01:25:17.128 --> 01:25:19.005
...or have you call me back?

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.090
Please, yes, that'll be great.

01:25:21.632 --> 01:25:22.759
Thank you, sir.

01:25:26.846 --> 01:25:27.764
Claire!

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:38.107
Claire!

01:26:03.966 --> 01:26:05.176
Claire!

01:26:31.202 --> 01:26:32.495
You all right, Claire?

01:26:32.745 --> 01:26:33.830
The braid!

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:38.042
Where's the braid?

01:26:38.292 --> 01:26:40.002
What are you talking about?

01:26:41.504 --> 01:26:43.506
What are you talking about?
This?

01:26:43.756 --> 01:26:45.758
Is this what you're talking about?

01:26:46.008 --> 01:26:50.054
- Where'd you get this?
- I took it from Madison's house.

01:26:52.348 --> 01:26:53.516
This is hers?

01:26:54.058 --> 01:26:56.102
This is Madison Frank's hair?

01:27:17.415 --> 01:27:18.791
What do you think?

01:27:20.084 --> 01:27:22.295
I really don't know.

01:27:26.549 --> 01:27:27.800
Norman.

01:27:33.264 --> 01:27:34.390
Yes...

01:27:36.309 --> 01:27:37.852
...I believe you.

01:28:28.361 --> 01:28:29.612
You're playing.

01:28:32.490 --> 01:28:33.783
She's gone.

01:28:35.827 --> 01:28:36.953
How do you know?

01:28:38.371 --> 01:28:39.997
I can feel it.

01:28:48.506 --> 01:28:51.342
I picked up the book you ordered
at the bookstore.

01:29:00.309 --> 01:29:03.980
Claire, I don't know how to apologize
to you for what I've done.

01:29:11.029 --> 01:29:13.197
But if you give me another chance...

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:19.579
...I promise I'll spend the rest of my
life making you glad that you did.

01:29:33.217 --> 01:29:34.469
Please.

01:29:53.237 --> 01:29:54.697
Last sail of the year.

01:29:54.947 --> 01:29:56.574
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:29:57.116 --> 01:30:00.370
We ought to take a drive
before the leaves all disappear.

01:30:01.079 --> 01:30:04.499
- Stay at a little bed-and-breakfast.
- Look for antiques.

01:30:04.749 --> 01:30:06.959
Yeah, we haven't
done that for a while.

01:30:08.461 --> 01:30:10.004
Adamant.

01:30:11.255 --> 01:30:14.842
- Adamant?
- An artsy little village down 7.

01:30:15.093 --> 01:30:17.136
Supposed to be charming.

01:30:17.845 --> 01:30:20.223
- Do you know it?
- No.

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:24.769
Maybe we'll stop there for lunch.

01:30:44.539 --> 01:30:45.998
What's that for?

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:48.167
Nothing.

01:33:37.795 --> 01:33:39.505
God, oh, God....

01:34:16.501 --> 01:34:18.753
You don't understand what that is.

01:34:20.463 --> 01:34:21.756
Don't I, Norman?

01:34:22.006 --> 01:34:25.009
That's Madison's necklace.

01:34:28.513 --> 01:34:30.223
You killed her, didn't you?

01:34:31.557 --> 01:34:33.101
I did not.

01:34:34.477 --> 01:34:36.020
I didn't kill anyone.

01:34:38.356 --> 01:34:40.066
Jesus, Claire.

01:34:40.316 --> 01:34:41.442
Listen to me.

01:34:42.985 --> 01:34:44.612
When I got here...

01:34:45.113 --> 01:34:48.991
...she was already dead. She killed
herself in our house to destroy me.

01:34:49.867 --> 01:34:51.411
Do you think I'm stupid?

01:34:51.869 --> 01:34:55.123
She left that for you in the garden,
with a letter.

01:34:55.373 --> 01:34:57.959
I burned the letter
and threw the box in the lake.

01:34:59.502 --> 01:35:00.461
A week before...

01:35:01.421 --> 01:35:04.674
...she showed up at the DuPont party.

01:35:07.468 --> 01:35:08.761
I was terrified.

01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:12.724
She insisted, so I agreed
to meet her here.

01:35:13.683 --> 01:35:14.851
When I got here...

01:35:15.101 --> 01:35:16.936
...she had taken pills.

01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:20.440
I tried to revive her, but...

01:35:21.274 --> 01:35:23.067
...she was gone.

01:35:23.735 --> 01:35:25.987
There was nothing I could do.

01:35:27.613 --> 01:35:30.700
So I put her in her car...

01:35:31.075 --> 01:35:33.161
...and I drove to the boat ramp...

01:35:33.453 --> 01:35:36.706
...and I rolled it out into the lake.

01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:40.293
I made a terrible mistake.
I know that.

01:35:40.877 --> 01:35:42.336
But tell me, Claire.

01:35:42.587 --> 01:35:45.590
What should I have done?
Should I sacrifice everything?

01:35:45.798 --> 01:35:47.425
Our marriage?

01:35:48.384 --> 01:35:51.637
My work,
which I spent my whole life on?

01:35:54.057 --> 01:35:55.767
Tell me, Claire.

01:35:56.934 --> 01:36:00.104
Tell me, please. Because we can
put this behind us.

01:36:01.439 --> 01:36:02.482
Our life can go on.

01:36:02.732 --> 01:36:04.275
It's not too late.

01:36:07.695 --> 01:36:10.073
What are you asking me to do?

01:36:12.241 --> 01:36:14.911
I'm asking you to forgive me.

01:36:29.217 --> 01:36:31.260
That girl must be brought up.

01:37:02.208 --> 01:37:05.044
Hello. This is Dr. Norman Spencer.

01:37:05.586 --> 01:37:07.130
I have some information...

01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:09.257
...about a missing person.

01:37:09.716 --> 01:37:11.968
Madison Frank, yes.

01:37:13.761 --> 01:37:16.514
Could you send an officer
out to the house, please?

01:37:19.183 --> 01:37:21.144
15 Willoughby Lane.

01:37:21.352 --> 01:37:23.479
It's about a mile from the bridge.

01:37:25.023 --> 01:37:26.149
Okay.

01:37:27.191 --> 01:37:28.484
Thank you.

01:37:42.874 --> 01:37:44.834
I'm gonna go get dressed.

01:39:51.294 --> 01:39:53.546
Information. What city?

01:40:01.179 --> 01:40:02.430
Don't!

01:40:05.016 --> 01:40:05.933
Stop it!

01:41:08.246 --> 01:41:10.415
I begged you, Claire.

01:41:11.749 --> 01:41:13.918
I pleaded with you.

01:41:19.173 --> 01:41:21.134
But you wouldn't let it go.

01:41:25.054 --> 01:41:26.514
Oh, Claire.

01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:31.728
I never wanted any of this to happen.

01:41:33.813 --> 01:41:34.856
All I ever wanted...

01:41:36.733 --> 01:41:38.693
...was for you to love me.

01:41:40.486 --> 01:41:42.030
Be proud of me.

01:41:43.823 --> 01:41:45.283
To be happy.

01:41:48.244 --> 01:41:50.246
She was going to go to the dean.

01:41:51.039 --> 01:41:52.665
She would have ruined us.

01:41:54.292 --> 01:41:56.961
Did she think I was just
gonna sit there...

01:41:57.211 --> 01:41:59.255
...and watch it happen?

01:42:03.968 --> 01:42:06.346
You have no idea what it was like.

01:42:06.721 --> 01:42:08.681
Hold her underwater...

01:42:11.684 --> 01:42:14.020
...watch her life slip away.

01:42:21.194 --> 01:42:23.237
But she gave me no choice.

01:42:33.915 --> 01:42:35.375
And neither have you.

01:42:41.547 --> 01:42:44.801
I can't figure out
how you put it all together.

01:42:45.593 --> 01:42:47.595
At first I thought you knew.

01:42:47.887 --> 01:42:52.266
Thought you created the whole
ghost thing as an elaborate trap.

01:42:53.309 --> 01:42:55.561
Then I realized you believed it.

01:42:56.145 --> 01:42:59.399
It was a passive-aggressive
masterpiece.

01:43:03.736 --> 01:43:05.613
The first time I met you...

01:43:06.447 --> 01:43:10.076
...all I ever wanted was to spend
the rest of my life with you.

01:43:12.370 --> 01:43:14.455
It's not gonna happen now.

01:43:49.407 --> 01:43:50.366
Too cold.

01:43:52.493 --> 01:43:55.246
I almost froze to death laying here...

01:43:55.496 --> 01:43:59.083
...wet, naked, pretending to be
electrocuted.

01:43:59.959 --> 01:44:01.419
Hey, Coop.

01:44:01.753 --> 01:44:04.213
How you doing? How you doing, boy?

01:44:04.464 --> 01:44:08.092
Let's go get your ball. Come on.
Come on.

01:44:26.152 --> 01:44:27.528
Jody, it's Norman.

01:44:27.779 --> 01:44:29.822
If you're there, pick up, please.

01:44:30.114 --> 01:44:32.241
It's Norman.

01:44:33.785 --> 01:44:35.244
Listen, Claire and I...

01:44:36.788 --> 01:44:38.331
...had a terrible blowout.

01:44:38.623 --> 01:44:39.999
Could you do me a favor?

01:44:40.208 --> 01:44:43.544
I'm sleeping at the lab. Could
you check on her in the morning?

01:44:44.212 --> 01:44:45.755
I'm worried about her.

01:44:47.632 --> 01:44:49.092
Thanks.

01:45:13.157 --> 01:45:15.493
The halothane's starting to wear off.

01:45:21.290 --> 01:45:23.126
I'm sure in some...

01:45:24.043 --> 01:45:27.046
...tragic way,
your suicide is gonna...

01:45:27.797 --> 01:45:30.883
...help bring Caitlin and I
closer together.

01:45:33.928 --> 01:45:35.888
And every time I look at her...

01:45:37.598 --> 01:45:38.766
...I'll see you.

01:45:45.273 --> 01:45:46.899
Oh, God.

01:46:11.591 --> 01:46:12.550
What's this?

01:57:44.367 --> 01:57:45.660
Oh, shit.

01:58:00.967 --> 01:58:03.011
I'm on the bridge!

01:58:03.594 --> 01:58:04.971
Somebody help me!

01:58:06.806 --> 01:58:07.932
I'm on the bridge!

01:58:46.387 --> 01:58:47.930
No!

01:59:38.731 --> 01:59:40.775
I beg you...

01:59:41.025 --> 01:59:42.318
...think of Caitlin.

01:59:42.568 --> 01:59:44.570
Please, don't. Please.
