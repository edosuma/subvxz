01:41.101 --> 01:44.036
Dear Mama,

01:44.171 --> 01:47.038
my vacation in Colorado

01:47.174 --> 01:48.699
turned out to be

01:48.842 --> 01:52.574
just like
a Hopalong Cassidy movie.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.547
We're all out here
to help Marion

01:56.683 --> 02:00.085
run her uncle's dude ranch.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.416
He was hurt

02:02.556 --> 02:06.186
<i>by a killer bull.</i>

02:06.326 --> 02:08.192
<i>And there's
this mean sidewinder neighbor,</i>

02:08.328 --> 02:12.287
<i>H.R. Buchanan, who's trying
to take over her uncle's land.</i>

02:14.034 --> 02:15.524
What can we do for you, sir?

02:15.669 --> 02:17.637
I hold a note
on Uncle Ben's ranch,

02:17.771 --> 02:20.365
and it's due noon... Friday.

02:20.507 --> 02:23.477
<i>We also met a nice girl
wrangler named Thunder.</i>

02:23.610 --> 02:26.341
<i>Both Fonzie and Richie
are wild about her.</i>

02:28.148 --> 02:30.014
I can't believe it.
You're getting all riled up

02:30.150 --> 02:31.845
just because we took a walk
together.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.886
I'll tell you something,
carrot, I ain't riled.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.820
<i>Joanie found herself a cowhunk.</i>

02:36.957 --> 02:38.948
Oh... the hunk loves me.

02:39.092 --> 02:40.958
The hunk loves me not.

02:41.094 --> 02:44.496
The hunk loves me.
The hunk loves me not.

02:50.904 --> 02:51.769
(firecracker popping)

02:53.006 --> 02:54.565
Hey! What happened?!

02:54.708 --> 02:57.200
- Help!
- Grab the reins, Joanie!

02:57.344 --> 02:58.937
Help me!

02:59.079 --> 03:00.672
Oh, boys, catch her!

03:09.156 --> 03:10.817
Fonzie, Richie, help me!

03:10.957 --> 03:13.221
I can't get the reins!

03:13.360 --> 03:15.795
Help me!

03:17.030 --> 03:19.556
Fonzie, Richie, get up here!
I'm trying to...

03:19.700 --> 03:23.398
I can't... Help me, Richie!

03:24.738 --> 03:26.706
Watch out!
Watch out for the wheel!

03:26.840 --> 03:28.365
Hold on, Cunningham!

03:28.508 --> 03:29.703
Why?

03:29.843 --> 03:31.971
You don't want to know!

03:32.112 --> 03:33.170
JOANIE:
Fonzie, watch out for the ditch!

03:34.214 --> 03:36.205
(engine revving)

03:38.018 --> 03:41.613
FONZIE:
Heyyy!

03:42.622 --> 03:44.613
(banging, clattering)

03:49.596 --> 03:51.894
Help! Help me!

03:52.032 --> 03:54.433
RICHIE:
Some ditch. That was a canyon.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.764
Fonz, my life passed
before my eyes.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.099
FONZIE:
Yeah. Mine started, too.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.298
I couldn't get past
the Polaski twins.

04:01.441 --> 04:03.170
You want to know something,
Fonz? It's me.

04:03.310 --> 04:06.109
Things like this don't happen
to Ralph, Potsie, Joanie...

04:06.246 --> 04:08.442
Red, Red, Red, Red, just push.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.573
- Right.
- Right.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.547
Richie, help!

04:17.690 --> 04:19.351
Help!

04:19.493 --> 04:21.483
(engine revving)

04:23.263 --> 04:26.358
Fonz, we got to catch up
to Joanie!

04:26.500 --> 04:28.992
FONZIE:
What do you think I'm here for?

04:29.136 --> 04:30.661
Fonz, Fonz, there she is!

04:33.673 --> 04:35.539
Fonzie, help!

04:35.675 --> 04:37.507
RICHIE: That's it, Fonz.
You're getting closer.

04:37.644 --> 04:41.012
You're doing great, Fonz!
(whoops)

04:44.651 --> 04:46.050
Richie, help!

04:46.186 --> 04:47.381
Go!

04:47.521 --> 04:49.387
Sounds like you said "go"!

04:49.523 --> 04:51.514
Will you get off the bike?

04:53.493 --> 04:56.895
Richie, what are you doing?

05:02.369 --> 05:03.131
Watch out!

05:18.318 --> 05:20.309
Be careful, Richie!

05:28.762 --> 05:30.161
What are you doing?

05:34.201 --> 05:37.171
Richie, don't jump!

05:48.615 --> 05:51.141
Whoa! Whoa!

05:51.284 --> 05:53.685
Whoa, Nellie!

05:58.024 --> 05:59.822
- Oh, Richie...
- Joanie!

05:59.960 --> 06:01.485
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.118
Oh, I'm so glad.

06:05.432 --> 06:06.831
- JOANIE: Oh.
- Hey, shortcake.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.868
- Oh, thanks, Fonz.
-(Fonzie and Richie laughing)

06:10.003 --> 06:11.402
All right, get off me.
Get off me.

06:11.538 --> 06:12.403
THUNDER:
Richie!

06:12.539 --> 06:13.904
Joanie!

06:14.040 --> 06:15.508
Richie, you were great!

06:15.642 --> 06:17.508
- You did it!
- Oh, thanks!

06:17.644 --> 06:19.635
Oh, Joanie...

06:21.081 --> 06:22.048
I rode the bike.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.172
Yep.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.250
You're gonna be a legend
in this town.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.409
RICHIE:
A legend?

06:26.553 --> 06:29.250
Oh, no, no, not a legend.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.584
A legend?

06:30.724 --> 06:33.250
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is

06:33.393 --> 06:36.761
to keep my cycle close to the
snorting, wild team of wild...

06:36.897 --> 06:39.093
Yep. Well, we better get back
to the ranch,

06:39.232 --> 06:40.893
'cause your folks are gonna be
mighty worried.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.627
- Oh, they sure are. -That's
right. Mom and Dad, Rich.

06:42.769 --> 06:44.237
- All right. Come on, Joanie.
Get up there. -Okay.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.770
- Be careful though.
- All right. I will, I will.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.499
- Be careful there.
- Okay.

06:47.641 --> 06:48.904
Get up there...

06:49.042 --> 06:50.703
Be careful, Rich.

06:52.379 --> 06:54.711
(whistles)

06:56.950 --> 06:58.748
Hah!

07:12.933 --> 07:14.924
(gopher squeaking)

07:19.739 --> 07:21.400
I rode the bike.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.805
Nobody wants
to listen to me here.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.940
(cheering and applause)

07:33.586 --> 07:37.318
Hey! Wait, wait!
Cowgirls and cowboys,

07:37.457 --> 07:39.653
our hero, Richie Cunningham!

07:39.793 --> 07:41.659
(cheering and applause)

07:41.795 --> 07:43.559
Speech! Speech!

07:43.697 --> 07:45.859
Come on,
let's get him up here.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.398
Speech!

07:47.534 --> 07:49.332
RICHIE:
Thank you. Thank you.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.996
Well, I'd-I'd just like to say
that, uh...

07:53.139 --> 07:54.698
it's really no big deal.
Yeah.

07:54.841 --> 07:56.707
No big deal. No big deal.

07:56.843 --> 07:58.641
He saves the life
of his younger sibling,

07:58.778 --> 08:00.507
he's got an audience...

08:00.647 --> 08:01.944
An audience?!

08:02.082 --> 08:04.050
Hey, did you hear the one about
the guy who left his wife...

08:04.184 --> 08:05.481
(laughter)

08:05.618 --> 08:06.881
Please, it's my moment.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.647
RALPH: Sorry, Rich,
I'll tell it to you later.

08:08.788 --> 08:09.778
RICHIE:
All right.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.516
(nervous chuckle)

08:11.658 --> 08:13.717
Uh, I would like to add,
however,

08:13.860 --> 08:16.192
that I never could have saved
my sister

08:16.329 --> 08:18.457
were it not for the superb...

08:18.598 --> 08:20.657
no, the-the superhuman effort

08:20.800 --> 08:22.495
of my good buddy Fonzie.

08:22.635 --> 08:25.627
Would you say
a few words, Fonz?

08:28.441 --> 08:30.170
Come on up, Fonz.

08:30.310 --> 08:34.110
Heyyy.

08:34.246 --> 08:35.976
Uncle Ben was so grateful.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.778
He laughed so hard
he threw his back out again.

08:38.918 --> 08:41.909
He didn't seem to mind.

08:42.054 --> 08:45.252
Oh, it's so peaceful here.

08:45.392 --> 08:48.657
Richard said there's an Indian
legend about this spot.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.662
Sure is beautiful.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.664
You know, sweetheart,
maybe we could come back

08:53.800 --> 08:54.995
to this ranch someday.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.330
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

08:56.469 --> 08:59.495
Uncle Ben would love that.

08:59.639 --> 09:02.631
The kids will be grown-up,
off and married...

09:02.776 --> 09:06.007
Our grandchildren
would love this place, Howard.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.274
Grandchildren?

09:08.415 --> 09:10.042
I never thought much about that.

09:10.183 --> 09:13.050
It's part of the reward
of growing old.

09:13.186 --> 09:17.589
My reward has been my life
with you, sweetheart.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.590
(woman sobbing)

09:19.726 --> 09:22.525
What was that?
It sounded like crying.

09:22.662 --> 09:27.122
I don't know, Howard,
it's just is the wind whistling.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.578
You're a very lucky fella,
you know that?

09:40.713 --> 09:42.579
Oh, yeah, I do know that.

09:42.715 --> 09:44.410
I've got my health...

09:44.551 --> 09:46.417
I'm talking about Thunder.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.681
She's in love with you, huh?

09:48.822 --> 09:50.449
In love with me?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.786
Hey, that is the only reason
I can figure

09:52.926 --> 09:55.896
that she can't see
my obvious charm.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.598
She is gaga over you.

09:59.732 --> 10:00.927
- Gaga?
- Mm-hmm.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.865
Oh, no way.
No, that's-that's serious.

10:03.002 --> 10:04.993
Uh, ga, maybe, but...

10:06.673 --> 10:09.870
Fonz, I'm spoken for.

10:10.009 --> 10:13.343
Lori Beth and I have
an arrangement back home. I...

10:13.480 --> 10:18.008
Oh. I-l can't string Thunder
along like this.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.346
Can I, Fonz?

10:19.486 --> 10:22.217
- No.
- No.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.084
Well, I'll just have to tell her
in the morning.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.291
(birds chirping)

10:29.596 --> 10:30.654
Hello.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.164
Oh, hi, Rich.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.097
Mighty fine sunrise, huh?

10:35.235 --> 10:38.637
Yep. Might be my last one
on this ranch.

10:38.771 --> 10:40.432
The note's due today.

10:40.573 --> 10:43.133
Not till noon.
We're not licked yet.

10:45.545 --> 10:48.412
You know, life's funny.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.277
I mean, the way things work out,

10:50.416 --> 10:53.283
how-how just being
in that one certain place

10:53.419 --> 10:56.787
that one certain time
can change your whole life.

10:58.791 --> 11:00.987
We met too late.

11:01.127 --> 11:02.993
Understand what I'm saying?

11:03.129 --> 11:04.654
Nope.

11:05.698 --> 11:07.097
Well...

11:07.233 --> 11:09.565
I've-I've got a girlfriend back
in Milwaukee.

11:09.702 --> 11:12.103
And we're going steady.

11:12.238 --> 11:15.936
Please, please,
just let me finish. I...

11:16.075 --> 11:18.271
Thunder, I-l want you
to know something.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.607
If there were no other women
in my life,

11:20.747 --> 11:23.273
why, then you'd be right
up there on top of my list.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.885
I mean, you would be...

11:26.019 --> 11:27.885
-my little cowgirl.
-(chuckles)

11:28.021 --> 11:29.887
Sure was pretty.

11:30.023 --> 11:33.084
Well, I'm a journalist.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.560
So, anyway,
I-l guess this is it.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.721
Oh, what are you doing?

11:38.865 --> 11:40.856
Well, I, uh...

11:41.000 --> 11:43.992
I just thought a good-bye kiss
might be nice. I'm sorry.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.265
That's okay, Rich.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.137
But you didn't have
to say all that.

11:49.275 --> 11:50.640
Because, uh...

11:50.777 --> 11:53.109
I-I like Fonzie.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.584
Let me tell you something,
Joanie, you are...

12:00.720 --> 12:03.087
-you're impressive on horseback.
-(chuckles)

12:03.223 --> 12:05.214
- Hi, Mom and Dad.
- Hey. -Hi.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.019
Oh, well, what's the matter?

12:07.160 --> 12:08.924
Why all the long faces?

12:09.062 --> 12:12.123
Oh, Joanie, Arthur...

12:12.265 --> 12:13.130
Yeah.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.961
...the ranch is lost.

12:15.101 --> 12:16.091
No.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.227
Oh...

12:19.439 --> 12:21.464
How much are we short?

12:21.608 --> 12:25.010
$1,017.38.

12:26.045 --> 12:29.071
You come up with the $17.38.

12:29.215 --> 12:31.047
I'll give you the thousand.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.710
Oh, Arthur,
that's a very gracious gesture.

12:33.853 --> 12:35.787
But you don't have
that kind of money,

12:35.922 --> 12:37.651
and we don't have the time.

12:37.790 --> 12:40.987
No, all I need is eight seconds.
That's as much time as it takes

12:41.127 --> 12:43.619
to ride that fat cow out there,
Diablo.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.994
Cow? That's a killer bull,
Fonzie.

12:47.133 --> 12:49.261
Oh, now, wait a minute, Fonzie.
I'm not going to allow that.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.801
No, I'm putting my foot down.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.496
Arthur, no ranch is worth
your getting hurt.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.368
- We did our best, we tried.
- You are not gonna ride

12:54.507 --> 12:55.975
-that bull, Fonzie. -We can't
make it work... -Yeah, you can't

12:56.109 --> 12:57.474
-ride the bull. -...we can't
make it work. We just...

12:57.610 --> 12:58.668
Now, hold it.

12:58.811 --> 13:01.405
I ride my motorcycle,
I'm on 40 horses.

13:01.547 --> 13:04.278
One bull is a step down.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.816
I'm coming back.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.613
With a thousand dollars.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.790
Fonzie's gonna ride the bull.

13:14.927 --> 13:17.328
Fonzie's gonna ride
the bull!

13:17.463 --> 13:19.625
This is crazy!

13:25.905 --> 13:27.839
Hey, guys. guys!

13:27.974 --> 13:30.875
Fonzie's gonna ride the bull!

13:31.010 --> 13:33.945
- Come on!
- Come on, let's go!

13:34.080 --> 13:36.674
Everybody,
Fonzie's gonna ride the bull!

13:36.816 --> 13:38.978
Fonzie's gonna ride the bull!

13:39.118 --> 13:41.712
Oh, keep...

13:41.854 --> 13:44.186
Keep cooking, little doggie!

13:44.324 --> 13:45.883
JOANIE:
Fonzie's gonna ride the bull!

13:46.025 --> 13:49.051
Fonzie's gonna
ride the bull! Come on!

13:49.195 --> 13:52.028
Fonzie's gonna ride the bull!

13:56.202 --> 13:58.068
Richard,
you got to talk to him.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.195
I'll give it a shot.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.616
-(chuffing)
- Whoa, mama.

14:11.751 --> 14:13.742
- All right.
-(indistinct crowd chatter)

14:17.323 --> 14:19.655
Fonz, is this true?

14:19.792 --> 14:21.851
What? That I'm gonna tangle
with this big cow?

14:21.994 --> 14:23.155
Yeah, it's true.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.321
Fonzie... it's a killer!

14:25.465 --> 14:27.160
- Come on, you can't do that,
Fonz. -(overlapping chatter)

14:27.300 --> 14:28.859
- Come on, Fonz!
- Come on!

14:29.001 --> 14:30.366
You can't ride this bull.

14:30.503 --> 14:31.732
Let me tell you something.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.635
The word "can't" is not
in the Fonzarelli dictionary.

14:33.773 --> 14:34.899
You understand that?

14:35.041 --> 14:37.908
All right. All right,
how about the word "dead"?

14:38.044 --> 14:39.341
Or how about "gored"?

14:39.479 --> 14:41.709
Or how about "trampled on,"
or how about "mangle"?

14:41.848 --> 14:43.111
How about the word
"friendship," huh?

14:43.249 --> 14:44.273
That's a good one, huh?

14:44.417 --> 14:45.680
Like when
your family needs your help

14:45.818 --> 14:46.910
'cause they're busting
their backs here

14:47.053 --> 14:49.454
to make a go of this place.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.118
- Oh, no.
- Look who's coming.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.387
You.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.156
Well... howdy. (laughs)

14:58.297 --> 15:00.789
Howdy. Everybody here
to see me take over?

15:00.933 --> 15:02.731
We've got a challenger
for Diablo.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.894
Oh, yeah? Well, no, you can't.

15:05.037 --> 15:07.438
You see, the offer's only good
during the rodeo.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.439
That's just as well.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.272
Arthur, I didn't want to see you
hurt riding that bull.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.677
-(neighing)
- Oh, you're the one.

15:15.815 --> 15:18.375
Well, as a matter of fact,

15:18.518 --> 15:20.316
as President
of the Cattleman's Association,

15:20.453 --> 15:23.320
I'm going to extend the deadline
for riding the bull.

15:23.456 --> 15:26.756
Oh, I'm going
to enjoy seeing you trampled.

15:26.893 --> 15:30.056
Mr. C., would you give
this creep the money,

15:30.196 --> 15:31.561
let him get out of here?

15:31.697 --> 15:33.722
Sure I can't get you
to change your mind?

15:33.866 --> 15:35.766
Give, give, give,
give, give, huh?

15:35.902 --> 15:37.495
(bull snorting)

15:37.637 --> 15:39.298
Now, excuse me.
I got work to do.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.463
All right?

15:40.606 --> 15:42.404
Good luck... Diablo.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.671
He's gonna need it.

15:45.812 --> 15:47.473
(snorting)

15:47.613 --> 15:50.275
Somebody's holding on
to the Fonz?

15:50.416 --> 15:51.611
Fonzie, don't.

15:51.751 --> 15:54.345
I grew up on horses,
and I know animals.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.353
That bull cannot be ridden.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.548
That bull hasn't met me yet.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.352
Will you wear this?

16:00.493 --> 16:02.291
(Fonzie laughs)

16:02.428 --> 16:03.554
I heard about flowered scarves,

16:03.696 --> 16:05.186
you know,
in the movies and stuff.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.299
I don't know. I don't know
about that, Thunder.

16:07.433 --> 16:10.767
But please. For me.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.571
I'll see you in eight seconds.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.702
All right.

16:22.915 --> 16:27.148
What am I, nutso?

16:27.286 --> 16:28.947
Red, get up here.

16:29.088 --> 16:30.681
I want to conversate with you.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.552
Oh. Do you want
to back out, Fonz?

16:32.692 --> 16:34.456
No, no, look.
Thunder-- she gave me this.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.084
- Any problems?
- No, Fonz.

16:36.229 --> 16:39.164
I had a nice talk with her,
and she and I are just friends.

16:39.298 --> 16:40.823
- Yeah. Yeah.
- She likes you.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.196
It's very nice
of you to ask, though.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.860
You know, I remember
the first time we ever met,

16:44.003 --> 16:45.903
-you were very considerate,
even... -Red!

16:46.038 --> 16:47.972
- I'm sitting on a bull here.
- Oh, right.

16:48.107 --> 16:49.632
- Good luck, Fonz.
- Right.

16:49.775 --> 16:51.209
- Get up here! Get up here!
- Huh?

16:51.344 --> 16:53.039
- What's this rope for?
- You hold onto that!

16:53.179 --> 16:56.171
I knew that. I knew that.

16:56.315 --> 16:58.977
The ranch is practically ours.

16:59.118 --> 17:00.984
(bull bellows)

17:01.120 --> 17:02.986
All right, open the chute.
(yells)

17:03.122 --> 17:05.113
(indistinct,
overlapping shouting)

17:07.492 --> 17:09.051
- Whoa! Hey!
- Get that bull!

17:09.194 --> 17:10.356
- Go, Fonz!
- Go, Fonzie!

17:10.496 --> 17:12.055
RICHIE:
Come on, stay with him!

17:12.198 --> 17:14.064
- Hang on, Fonz!
-(Marion yells)

17:14.200 --> 17:15.326
(loud, indistinct,
overlapping shouting)

17:15.468 --> 17:17.266
- How much time?
- I lost. I can't re...

17:17.403 --> 17:18.996
- HOWARD: Hang on!
-(indistinct shouting)

17:20.306 --> 17:22.172
Four seconds. Come on, Fonz!

17:22.308 --> 17:24.174
You can do it! Stay on!

17:24.310 --> 17:25.435
(applause and whistling)

17:25.578 --> 17:26.840
- Two more.
- Two...

17:26.979 --> 17:28.606
- You did it, Fonz!
-(Thunder screams)

17:28.748 --> 17:30.113
- You did it!
- I got to get off this!

17:32.718 --> 17:37.053
(applause and cheering)

17:39.191 --> 17:40.386
- Fonzie, the bull!
-(bull chuffing)

17:40.526 --> 17:42.187
Sounds like you said,
"The bull."

17:42.328 --> 17:43.523
- Look out, Fonzie!
- Oh, my God!

17:43.663 --> 17:45.631
(indistinct shouting)

17:45.765 --> 17:48.097
(bull chuffing)

17:48.234 --> 17:49.633
- In the barrel, Fonzie!
- MAN: No.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.259
(bull chuffing)

17:51.404 --> 17:54.806
(bull snorting,
female screaming)

17:54.941 --> 17:57.706
(applause, indistinct shouting)

17:57.843 --> 17:58.810
He's in the barrel!

17:58.945 --> 18:00.276
MARION:
He should get out of there!

18:00.413 --> 18:03.075
- HOWARD: Marion...
- POTSIE: Run!

18:03.215 --> 18:04.080
- The bull!
- Look out! -(thudding)

18:04.216 --> 18:06.514
- The bull! The bull!
- Get out of there!

18:08.020 --> 18:10.114
(bull snorting,
indistinct chatter)

18:14.060 --> 18:15.550
- Don't move!
- Richie's gonna save him!

18:18.297 --> 18:20.163
All right, come on, bull!

18:20.299 --> 18:22.597
- Richard! -What are you doing?!
- Richie! -(cheering)

18:22.735 --> 18:26.933
(applause and cheering)

18:28.307 --> 18:30.901
Come on, bully.

18:31.043 --> 18:33.273
(bull snorting)

18:33.412 --> 18:35.676
Tame that hunk of meat, Rich!
You can do it!

18:35.815 --> 18:36.976
(shouting)

18:37.116 --> 18:39.915
Fonzie, stay in the barrel!

18:40.052 --> 18:41.679
Come on, bully.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.846
- Richard, get out of there!
- Come on! Now!

18:43.990 --> 18:46.186
All right, come on!

18:50.663 --> 18:53.428
(hoof beats)

18:57.470 --> 18:58.801
Whoa!

18:58.938 --> 19:02.101
(applause and cheering)

19:06.746 --> 19:08.942
Oh.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.482
- Oh, great work, Rich.
- Oh.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.608
(applause and cheering)

19:14.954 --> 19:16.820
(indistinct shouting)

19:16.956 --> 19:18.822

19:18.958 --> 19:20.119
<i>4+.“
"Oh!</i>

19:20.259 --> 19:21.522
I'm sorry. I hardly know you.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.527
Well, that'll teach
that old bull.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.824
(Richie and Thunder laugh)

19:24.964 --> 19:26.125
(sighs)

19:26.265 --> 19:28.256
(applause)

19:30.269 --> 19:32.135
Whoa.

19:32.271 --> 19:34.933
(applause and cheering)

19:38.010 --> 19:39.171
(applause and cheering)

19:39.311 --> 19:40.608
Here is a certified check

19:40.746 --> 19:43.875
from the Colorado Cattleman's
Association for $1,000.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.541
(applause and cheering)

19:45.685 --> 19:46.982
Oh.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.986
Well, you still owe $17.38.

19:50.122 --> 19:52.989
And you've got exactly
15 seconds to come up with it.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.854
Well, here's ten dollars, huh?

19:54.994 --> 19:56.928
- Here's two.
- I got a silver dollar.

19:57.063 --> 19:58.758
L-I got three bucks right here.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.059
- MAN: I got one.
- Yeah. -MARION: Ah.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.598
Now all we need is
<i>38</i> cents in change.

20:01.734 --> 20:02.860
Come on,
somebody come up with it!

20:03.002 --> 20:04.163
You got five seconds.

20:04.303 --> 20:06.533
Here's a quarter!
Pots, hurry. You got any change?

20:06.672 --> 20:09.437
Sorry, Malph.
All I got's a five.

20:09.575 --> 20:10.667
- Oh!
- HOWARD: Give me that!

20:10.810 --> 20:12.801
(cheering)

20:15.181 --> 20:17.047
And I'll take this note, sir,

20:17.183 --> 20:19.277
and kindly ask you
to get off this property.

20:19.418 --> 20:20.613
- Yeah.
-(shouting)

20:20.753 --> 20:22.278
Well, where's my car?

20:22.421 --> 20:24.048
Oh.

20:24.190 --> 20:26.420
It's right over there, Mr. H.R.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.358
We parked it
in a very special spot for you.

That's right,
I'm gonna ride a horse.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.349
Thunder gave me the secret,
you know.

22:30.482 --> 22:32.314
- Yup.
- She said,

22:32.451 --> 22:37.048
just think of a horse like a
motorcycle with feet, you know?

22:37.189 --> 22:38.816
Got me a leather jacket
for my legs.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.255
I am all set to go.

22:40.392 --> 22:42.622
Very cool.

22:43.662 --> 22:47.621
(neighing)

22:47.766 --> 22:49.632
Whoa, whoa, I'm up.

22:49.768 --> 22:50.929
(laughs)
I'm up!

22:51.070 --> 22:54.506
A ride
with my two favorite fellas.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.039
Gosh, ma'am.

22:56.175 --> 22:58.166
Aaayyhg

23:32.244 --> 23:34.178
<i>MARION: Everybody,
I have a <i>big surprise.</i></i>

23:34.313 --> 23:37.442
<i>I</i> have a letter here
from Uncle Ben.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.984
It's very nice, and I want
you all to hear this.

23:40.119 --> 23:43.089
"Dear Marion, well,
I am back on my feet again.

23:43.222 --> 23:46.783
"I feel fine, the ranch is going
great thanks to all your help.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.759
"The check-- it's for all
the money you loaned me.

23:49.895 --> 23:52.421
Tell Al
his meat finally got done."

23:52.564 --> 23:54.032
-(laughter)
-"It fell into the fire."

23:54.166 --> 23:55.998
(laughter)

23:56.135 --> 23:58.229
"I don't know
how I can thank all of you.

23:58.370 --> 24:00.498
My heart is full. Uncle Ben."

24:00.639 --> 24:01.800
- JOANIE: Aw...
-(murmurs)

24:01.941 --> 24:03.409
(sniffles)

24:03.542 --> 24:05.237
What's wrong, Mrs. C.?

24:05.377 --> 24:07.345
Well, oh, it's just...

24:07.479 --> 24:09.277
You're all so wonderful, Arthur.

24:09.415 --> 24:12.248
I asked you
to come and help, and you did.

24:12.384 --> 24:14.546
I can always count on you.

24:16.488 --> 24:20.186
Well, what do you say
we get the garage cleaned up?

24:20.326 --> 24:22.693
If we all pitch in, we can get
it done in a couple of hours.

24:22.828 --> 24:26.196
<i>Uh... uh, Jenny Pint-Mo's.
Te“ her about the trip.</i>

24:26.332 --> 24:27.766
Uh, I got a date with Lori Beth.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.299
I haven't seen her
in a couple of weeks.

24:29.435 --> 24:31.028
I got motors dying
to be tuned, huh?

24:31.170 --> 24:32.660
Hey, don't close that door.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.466
Whoa.

24:34.606 --> 24:36.199
(door closes)

24:36.342 --> 24:39.073
Don't look at me.
I have dishes to do.

24:39.211 --> 24:41.475
Okay, Marion.

24:41.613 --> 24:43.604
I got to send a telegram.

24:45.117 --> 24:47.415
Hello. Western Union?

24:47.553 --> 24:50.022
I'd like to send a wire
to Marion Cunningham.

24:50.155 --> 24:54.149
"Marion, lonely man
has free evening.

24:54.293 --> 24:57.126
Would like to watch the deer
and the antelope play."
