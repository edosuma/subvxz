Now I'm stuck listening to Jerky
MacIrritating across the street, now.

09:08.347 --> 09:10.682
(WHISTLES) Shh.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.518
What's that? Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll stop.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.420
I didn't realize I
was disturbing you.

09:15.422 --> 09:16.621
Cheery-bye.

09:17.089 --> 09:19.124
Huh. I guess I might
have overthought

09:19.126 --> 09:20.759
that solution
just a little bit.

09:20.761 --> 09:25.096
(YELLS) Curse you,
Perry the Platypus!

09:25.598 --> 09:26.798
Whoo!

09:26.800 --> 09:28.066
Ahh!

09:28.267 --> 09:29.634
Whoo!

09:30.102 --> 09:31.570
CARL: This had better work.

09:31.572 --> 09:34.172
Don't worry, Carl. Once
you save my dad's life,

09:34.174 --> 09:36.575
there's no way even he could
avoid thanking you for it.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.243
I hope for your
sake you're right.

09:38.844 --> 09:41.079
Y'know, it's funny
how no one's noticed

09:41.081 --> 09:44.449
a grand piano dangling
precariously over our table.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.785
Well, I also tied up a
couple of violins over there

09:46.787 --> 09:47.785
so it would seem
like a theme.

09:47.787 --> 09:50.088
All right, listen.
So when my dad returns,

09:50.090 --> 09:51.723
I'll excuse myself
and cut the rope

09:51.725 --> 09:54.759
and you push my dad out of the way
of the falling piano. Got it?

09:54.761 --> 09:56.628
Well, let's get to
that dessert menu.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.263
Excuse me, Dad.
It's my turn.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.864
I'll be right back.
You guys start.

09:59.866 --> 10:02.567
Sure, sure. Thank you
for not making us wait.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.869
(CHUCKLES) That bathroom
attendant was lovely.

10:04.871 --> 10:07.172
He gave me mints
and some floss.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.373
I just couldn't
thank him enough.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.741
(GASPS) Watch out, sir!

10:11.110 --> 10:13.411
Dad! Carl!
Are you all right?

10:13.413 --> 10:15.180
Oh, I'm fine.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.549
I'm all right too, sir.

10:17.551 --> 10:21.152
Wow, Carl. You saved
my dad's life.

10:21.154 --> 10:24.189
Yes. It's a shame he
couldn't save the table too.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.558
Let's go find the host. No, wait.
What? Seriously?

10:26.560 --> 10:27.859
What?
Dad.

10:28.227 --> 10:29.694
Aren't you going
to thank him?

10:29.696 --> 10:32.464
Oh, well, I didn't
realize, I hadn't.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.232
Thank you for pointing
that out to me, Monty.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.567
Dad!

10:35.569 --> 10:38.370
Oh, uh, yes, right.
Thank you, Carl.

10:40.606 --> 10:42.607
Oh, well, more
dessert for us.

10:43.175 --> 10:44.342
No, it's different
this time!

10:44.344 --> 10:46.144
She promised to come
down and meet us.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.613
Right. My expectations have
been completely reversed.

10:48.615 --> 10:50.815
No! You'll see. She'll
explain everything.

10:50.817 --> 10:51.916
Everything!

10:51.918 --> 10:53.284
(DOORBELL RINGS)

10:53.286 --> 10:54.552
(GIGGLES)

10:54.554 --> 10:56.321
(GASPS)
Yes! See.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.923
Mom, lady. Lady, Mom.
Now, tell her everything.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.925
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say...

11:00.927 --> 11:03.728
Take your hands off me, Copper!
I know my rights.

11:03.730 --> 11:06.564
Sorry, Candace. Water
the plant for me.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.867
I don't understand.
What's going on?

11:08.869 --> 11:09.667
Police matter, miss.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.904
What could that sweet old
lady have possibly done?

11:12.906 --> 11:15.840
That "sweet" old lady is
Peggy "The Pyramid" McGee,

11:15.842 --> 11:18.877
the notorious ringleader of
Danville's biggest pyramid scheme.

11:18.879 --> 11:19.577
Pyramid scheme?

11:19.579 --> 11:22.847
That's right. She's been
selling these all over town.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.850
See. These are just flat triangles
painted in perspective!

11:25.852 --> 11:26.550
That's fraud.

11:26.552 --> 11:30.588
I'll be out before the time
her mom serves pie!

11:31.424 --> 11:32.857
Wow, Candace.
I can't believe it.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.860
A pyramid scheme
right under our noses.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.929
Yeah.
Imagine that.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.965
(MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

11:42.401 --> 11:43.768
Hey!
Hey, yourself.

11:43.770 --> 11:44.836
I thought, uh...

11:44.838 --> 11:46.504
Yeah, so did I.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.641
But then I figured I couldn't
leave you here to suffer alone.

11:49.643 --> 11:50.341
That's what I like.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.844
Thoughtful and dismissive
simultaneously.

11:52.846 --> 11:56.281
DOOFENSHMIRTZ: (YELLS) No! Wait, wait, wait!
Is that the Love Sandals?

11:56.283 --> 12:00.418
Whoa! Watch the
hands, lady! Hey!
