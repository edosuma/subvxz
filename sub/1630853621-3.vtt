I think you'll find...

52:18.343 --> 52:20.470
I'm not quite the man
I used to be.

52:25.809 --> 52:28.645
Hey, did they get your mom too?

52:29.729 --> 52:32.983
Do-- do you know where she is?
Is she here?

52:32.983 --> 52:35.527
No, Daddy. She's not.

52:35.527 --> 52:39.239
But me and Mommy were never
the ones Hale needed anyways.

52:40.031 --> 52:42.200
All she needed was you.

52:49.875 --> 52:52.502
Shit.

52:53.461 --> 52:55.130
Did you really think

52:55.130 --> 52:57.048
that toy gun was going
to stop me?

53:00.176 --> 53:02.846
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

53:14.858 --> 53:16.109
You're not Frankie.

53:19.946 --> 53:21.823
This won't take long, Daddy.
