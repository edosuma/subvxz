WEBVTT

00:14.639 --> 00:16.975
Ball or treat?

00:19.769 --> 00:22.021
Come on, Bruv... choose.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.357
-That's stupid.

00:24.441 --> 00:27.569
-Yes, Bruv.
Master of his own destiny.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.571
-He is not, though, is he?
-Uh,

00:29.654 --> 00:32.365
-Bruv chose the ball.
-Yeah,

00:32.449 --> 00:35.660
from a list of two options
that you gave him.

00:36.494 --> 00:37.912
-Hm.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.957
-Can I have a coffee?
-No, we're closing.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.752
Please, just five minutes.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.170
Um, I should go bounce

00:45.253 --> 00:46.796
'cause there's this
thing I've gotta do.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.716
-See ya tomorrow, Fooze.
-Legendary.

00:50.425 --> 00:51.968
Come on, Bruv.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.220
Cute baby.

00:55.388 --> 00:58.349
-No, Bruv! Bruv.

01:01.895 --> 01:02.854
Here you go.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.983
It's the end of the day,
so whatever.

01:10.612 --> 01:11.738
Don't go.

01:13.865 --> 01:15.909
I've got to close
the kitchen.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.345
Be with you in a sec!

03:42.931 --> 03:45.308
Why have I got 17
missed calls from you?

03:45.391 --> 03:48.853
-Did you get my voicemail?
-No one listens to voicemail.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.606
What's going on?

04:00.365 --> 04:02.158
Why is there a baby here?

04:02.825 --> 04:04.077
Right?!

04:07.038 --> 04:08.539
I need coffee.

04:10.541 --> 04:12.335
Don't touch it.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.213
I've had the weirdest
24 hours, Reets.

04:15.296 --> 04:16.839
It's been a madness.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.904
Skinny or full-fat?

04:47.036 --> 04:48.162
Reets?

04:51.874 --> 04:55.253
Reets? Rita!

04:55.336 --> 04:58.256
-I told you not to touch it!
-What--

04:59.257 --> 05:00.800
This was a bad idea.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.137
You know what, Reets?

05:04.220 --> 05:07.515
I've got this.
You should just go home.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.475
Why don't I take him
out for a walk?

05:09.559 --> 05:11.936
You can wash, have a nap.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.355
That's not a good idea.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.941
We'll have a fun time
together, won't we?

05:17.025 --> 05:19.193
Yes! Yes, we will.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.821
Spend some fun time
with Auntie Rita.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.824
It's good to get
some practice in
before mine comes.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.870
What?

05:28.953 --> 05:31.122
You can trust me
with your baby.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.170
This isn't my baby, Reet.

05:37.253 --> 05:41.799
-Okay.
-No, not okay.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.509
It's not my baby.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.346
Well... it is.

05:49.348 --> 05:50.850
Are you all right?

05:50.933 --> 05:52.101
If you're struggling,

05:52.185 --> 05:53.936
there's no shame
in admitting it.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.898
-We are all here for you.
-Stop, stop, stop, stop.

05:56.981 --> 06:00.151
This isn't my baby.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.445
This isn't funny, Tash.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.947
No, I know it's not.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.785
-Do you want me to call anyone?
-No, because I called you.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.620
I just meant, like...

06:13.372 --> 06:15.375
Go on...

06:15.458 --> 06:17.877
Go on, just say it.
I'm not annoyed.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.170
You should call your sister.

06:19.253 --> 06:21.547
Whew. Better out than in.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.467
I think Bobbi would be
a good person to have around.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.469
Cool. I don't.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.846
Okay, we're going for a walk.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.223
You need a shower.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.308
No, Rita. It's not safe.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.310
-Give me the baby.
-Every time I let myself

06:34.393 --> 06:36.437
-get sucked up into your drama.
-Give me the baby.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.356
-Give me the baby.
-You drag me over here
in a total state,

06:38.439 --> 06:39.732
-and then don't want my help.
-Rita, give me the baby.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.025
In case you
haven't noticed,
I've got a lot...

06:41.109 --> 06:42.110
-Rita, give me the baby.
-...on my plate, too.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.028
-Rita, give me--
-You're being mental!

06:44.112 --> 06:46.531
Give me the fuckin' baby!

06:47.573 --> 06:50.952
I'm sorry, Reets,
about all that.

06:51.035 --> 06:54.497
I don't know why I flipped.
I think it's just, you know?

06:58.835 --> 07:02.672
'Cause I'm fine.
Batshit, but fine.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.257
-Maybe, you sh--
-Sorry.

07:06.092 --> 07:10.012
Says... are you
free on Friday

07:10.096 --> 07:12.348
for pizza
and Jagermeister?

07:12.431 --> 07:14.809
Oi, get your
own best mate.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.187
Listen, I'll call Bobbi.
Promise.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.190
You know what?

07:21.274 --> 07:23.484
I'm just gonna wait
with you till she comes.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.529
Seriously, can you
just fuck off?

07:29.949 --> 07:31.033
Okay.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.493
Yeah.

07:40.376 --> 07:42.461
Are you fuckin' with me?

07:56.809 --> 07:59.395
-Mags.
-Mags Hey.

07:59.478 --> 08:02.356
Mags... stupid question.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.983
I don't have a baby, do I?

08:09.363 --> 08:12.617
-Mags?
-I thought you were
calling to apologize.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.202
-What?
-About poker night.

08:14.285 --> 08:18.331
-Friday? You were an asshole?
-Yes! Poker night.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.124
I didn't have a baby
on poker night, did I?

08:20.208 --> 08:23.085
'Cause I don't have
a baby... right?

08:27.256 --> 08:28.424
Mags?

08:32.011 --> 08:35.389
I honestly don't have time
for your weirdness today.

08:37.099 --> 08:39.393
Look... I'm going
to the park later.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.270
If you're puttin'
him down for a nap,

08:41.354 --> 08:43.689
we could meet up in an hour.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.858
Tash?

08:47.151 --> 08:48.277
Natasha?

08:59.205 --> 09:00.957
I know I'm not your mum...

09:02.124 --> 09:04.543
and you know I'm not your mum.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.504
And I don't know
what your game is,

09:06.587 --> 09:08.256
but I'm not playing it.

09:08.339 --> 09:11.342
You are not gettin'
inside my head.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.102
All right.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.356
Let's have a look then.

09:25.439 --> 09:30.736
How many Lydia McNaish-Wilcoxes
can there be in Bexhill?

09:34.407 --> 09:35.700
Yes!

09:38.035 --> 09:39.787
Home time, you little cunt.

10:21.662 --> 10:26.834
-Awesome baby.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.712
Babies are sick.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.089
-I'm--
-Before they've
developed frameworks

10:32.173 --> 10:33.507
for organizing concepts,

10:33.591 --> 10:35.718
they experience the world
as raw data.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.636
Awareness
in its purest form.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.972
-I'm--
-This baby is
literally jammin'

10:40.056 --> 10:43.392
with universal
consciousness right now.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.019
-Have you smelled his head?
-Yeah.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.395
It is the best
smell in the world.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.481
-You should smell it.
-I have, thanks.

10:48.564 --> 10:51.567
-Hey, Bruv. No, man.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.235
Compadre,
that is not how we do.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.779
-Bruv.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.614
Bruv, man.

10:56.697 --> 10:59.075
I'm really sorry.
He usually loves babies.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.826
Bruv, come here.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.578
Here, Bruv.
Get the ball.

11:02.661 --> 11:04.080
Get the ball, Bruv.

11:04.163 --> 11:07.124
Go on...
Yeah, good boy.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.334
I'm a friend of Lydia's.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.586
Yeah, they just
told us this morning.

11:10.669 --> 11:13.339
Lydia was a empress.
May she rest in power.

11:13.422 --> 11:16.759
I got promoted,
but the truth is,
management sucks.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.595
I just feel like I'm kinda part
of the problem now, you know?

11:19.678 --> 11:23.099
Okay.
Just, like, looking
for... her family.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.934
I've got something of hers
that I need to return.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.769
She didn't really
speak to her family.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.437
-Yeah, they were
really bad racists.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.814
Okay, what about a partner?

11:29.897 --> 11:31.524
Nah, she was married
to her books.

11:31.607 --> 11:34.068
This is actually urgent.
I'm looking for someone.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.695
Anyone...
Like, immediately.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.114
Your baby pooped.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.201
The changing room's
at the back.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.745
Well, I can't do it.
I haven't even got a nappy.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.456
I've got a spare one.

11:55.673 --> 11:56.841
Hey.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.510
What's the protocol here?

12:00.344 --> 12:01.971
Can I change your nappy?

12:03.681 --> 12:05.891
Okay, I suppose
you'll let me know.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.146
Okay.

12:21.657 --> 12:22.992
We good?

12:23.075 --> 12:25.202
No funny business, yeah?

12:26.996 --> 12:28.247
'Kay.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.501
Okay.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.379
You're a boy.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.507
All right, welcome
to the gender binary.

12:39.508 --> 12:40.509
Uhh!

12:40.593 --> 12:43.512
Ah, ah. Oh, oh.

12:43.596 --> 12:47.349
-Ah, ah, ah.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.352
Ah, ah... Oh.

13:09.663 --> 13:13.125
Well, if you think it's
so funny, do it yourself!

13:30.392 --> 13:33.437
He's just a baby.
He's just a baby.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.106
He's just a baby.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.071
Is everything okay?

13:46.158 --> 13:48.494
My sister's baby...

13:48.577 --> 13:51.789
she needs changing,
like, 25 times a day.

13:51.872 --> 13:55.668
Yeah!
She's a real poop machine.

13:55.751 --> 14:00.339
-I've changed
a baby's nappy before.

14:00.422 --> 14:04.134
You know,
my niece came out
really white as well.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.262
Happens.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.680
Here you go.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.936
-Yeah, yeah.

14:14.019 --> 14:14.812
Hey, Bruv, man.

14:14.895 --> 14:17.064
His mother rejected him
as a pup,

14:17.147 --> 14:20.150
so he gets mad
separation anxiety issues.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.069
You're afraid I'm gonna
leave you, aren't you?

14:22.152 --> 14:24.071
Yeah, Bruv, I'd never do that.

14:24.154 --> 14:26.490
Here... ball.
Get the ball.

14:30.035 --> 14:33.205
Yeah, last time I saw Lydia
was, like, a month ago

14:33.289 --> 14:35.416
before that crazy
shit went down.

14:35.499 --> 14:36.584
What crazy shit?

14:36.667 --> 14:39.253
A customer
choked to death on a cookie.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.463
Lydia found her.
Totally bleaked her out.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.798
She stopped
coming to work,

14:42.881 --> 14:44.300
stopped answering
her calls,

14:44.383 --> 14:45.634
cut off all her friends.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.845
Next thing you know,
she--

14:48.637 --> 14:49.722
Fuck!

14:51.015 --> 14:52.766
Well... you know.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.523
You still got shit
on your hands, you know?

15:08.157 --> 15:10.367
Whoa, same babygrow.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.452
Wild.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.962
-It wasn't Lydia's baby.
-Sorry?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.924
Why didn't you tell me
that the woman had a baby?

15:26.008 --> 15:27.968
I don't know...
I forgot.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.557
Whoa.

15:33.641 --> 15:37.436
-'Sup.
-What 'bout that baby?

15:37.519 --> 15:39.938
Is that the same baby
from the CCTV?

15:49.990 --> 15:52.117
Come on, Fooze.
I need you to remember.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.952
I'm sorry. Can't help you.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.205
-Yeah, you can.

15:56.288 --> 16:00.167
Listen... that woman came
in with a baby, right?

16:00.250 --> 16:01.835
Think so.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.212
What do you mean you think so?

16:03.295 --> 16:04.880
-We just watched it
on the video.

16:04.963 --> 16:06.423
It was wearing
the same babygrow.

16:17.601 --> 16:20.396
Forgive me, queen.
Grindstone calls.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.231
-No, wait--
-Bruv?

16:23.482 --> 16:24.566
Bruv?!

16:25.859 --> 16:27.486
Bruv?

16:27.569 --> 16:29.238
Yo, where's my homeslice?

16:29.321 --> 16:31.115
-Bruv?

16:31.615 --> 16:32.533
Bruv!

16:34.952 --> 16:37.329
-Bruv!

16:38.122 --> 16:39.331
Fuck!

16:41.166 --> 16:42.668
Bruv!

16:44.962 --> 16:46.255
Bruv!

16:54.221 --> 16:55.305
Bruv.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.185
Truck
I'm sorry.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.770
He just--
He just ran out!

17:02.980 --> 17:05.107
Super fucked up!

17:07.651 --> 17:09.278
You can't just kill a dog.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.744
How many people
have you done this to?

18:39.827 --> 18:42.704
Keep your head straight...
It's just a baby.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.246
No bullshit. I mean it.

20:07.956 --> 20:09.875
I'm only feeding you
to keep you quiet.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.501
Don't get any ideas.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.468
What'd ya think?
Should have more garlic?

20:20.802 --> 20:22.346
Nah, you're right.

21:38.130 --> 21:42.259
Mama. Mama.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.220
Mama...

22:30.182 --> 22:31.725
Bobbi
Hello?

22:34.686 --> 22:36.438
Is that you, Natasha?

22:40.150 --> 22:41.443
Natasha?

24:09.573 --> 24:11.324
Fuck am I doing?

25:30.695 --> 25:35.075
It's okay.

25:35.158 --> 25:38.245
Let's go back to the car.
Shouldn't have left you.

25:38.328 --> 25:42.457
-I'm sorry.
We're good, we're good.

25:55.553 --> 25:57.389
Mrs.
I think we need to talk.
