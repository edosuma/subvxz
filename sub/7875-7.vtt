00:33.229 --> 00:34.857
Nothing says "American family"...

00:35.024 --> 00:37.902
...like raising the flag
with your wife and two kids.

00:38.069 --> 00:40.696
Let Wednesday begin.

00:43.367 --> 00:47.246
Look at that bald eagle, kids.
Majestic.

00:47.413 --> 00:50.668
"I'm dead, and I need a kiss."

00:52.086 --> 00:54.297
Cut it out. Go. Get it away.
I will kill you.

00:54.464 --> 00:56.132
Steve, Hayley, knock it off.

00:56.299 --> 00:59.804
Steve, go mail that to Donovan McNabb.
See if he'll sign it.

00:59.970 --> 01:02.516
Hey, it's our favorite gay neighbors.

01:04.810 --> 01:07.729
What are you guys doing today?
Shopping? Brunching? Parading?

01:07.896 --> 01:09.857
Or taking the day off
and just being gay?

01:10.024 --> 01:11.192
Dad, what are you doing?

01:11.360 --> 01:15.114
Just reminding Greg and Terry
I'm cool with the man-on-man crowd.

01:15.280 --> 01:18.243
You two probably wanna gossip.
Dish, you queenie bitches.

01:18.410 --> 01:20.871
Actually, we do have some big news.

01:21.038 --> 01:25.459
- We've decided to have a baby.
- Congratulations. Are you adopting?

01:25.626 --> 01:26.837
No, we're having our own.

01:27.003 --> 01:30.007
Terry thinks we can handle
this sort of seismic life change...

01:30.174 --> 01:33.386
...so here goes nothing.

01:33.553 --> 01:35.848
Take my hand.

01:36.557 --> 01:39.060
Guys, guys, a baby's not like a fire.

01:39.227 --> 01:41.896
You can't just
rub two sticks together and:

01:42.063 --> 01:43.773
We're doing in vitro fertilization.

01:43.940 --> 01:46.777
- In vitro? What's that?
- Well, we've got an egg donor.

01:46.944 --> 01:48.947
They'll combine her eggs
with our sperm...

01:49.114 --> 01:51.283
...and implant those embryos
in a surrogate...

01:51.450 --> 01:53.952
...where, God willing,
one of them will grow to term.

01:54.120 --> 01:57.666
<i>I thought I saw every episode of
Star Trek. Wait, is this Deep Space Nine?</i>

01:57.833 --> 02:00.627
I won't watch that. It's garbage.
I'll tell you why. One...

02:00.794 --> 02:02.629
Stan, this isn't science fiction.

02:02.796 --> 02:06.427
It's real fiction.
And I think it's fantastic.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.761
We're even converting our gym
into a nursery.

02:08.928 --> 02:12.183
Which is fine, because I don't need
to work out ever again.

02:13.435 --> 02:15.145
Help me.

02:17.689 --> 02:21.152
I don't believe it. I let them be gay,
and this is how they repay me?

02:21.319 --> 02:22.779
What's that supposed to mean?

02:22.946 --> 02:24.616
If two men open up to each other...

02:24.782 --> 02:28.119
...and share a love more exquisite
than anything a man and woman...

02:28.286 --> 02:30.664
...could ever find together,
that's their problem.

02:30.831 --> 02:34.169
But when they try to bring a child into it,
I gotta put my foot down.

02:34.336 --> 02:37.923
Well, excuse me, but who are you to say
whether they should have kids?

02:38.089 --> 02:39.842
A concerned American, Francine.

02:40.009 --> 02:43.680
I've always said you can't raise normal
children in an abnormal environment.

02:43.847 --> 02:46.850
You know what that'll do to society?
Girls playing with trucks.

02:47.017 --> 02:49.771
Boys playing with dolls.
Horses eating each other.

02:49.938 --> 02:51.397
Yes, horses eating each other.

02:51.564 --> 02:53.858
- Read the Bible.
- Well, I admire Greg and Terry.

02:54.025 --> 02:56.195
They're taking their lives
to the next level.

02:56.362 --> 02:58.114
Francine, it's unnatural.

02:58.281 --> 03:01.369
I mean, why don't I just start a family
with the couch?

03:01.535 --> 03:04.413
Hey, kids. How was school?
Brush your teeth. Stay off drugs.

03:04.580 --> 03:09.211
Hello, wife. Miss me? I missed you.

03:09.836 --> 03:12.047
Oh, man,
the things I'm gonna do to you.

03:12.214 --> 03:14.717
Lie on your stomach.
I'll prop you up with the kids.

03:14.884 --> 03:17.304
- Stan.
- See how weird it gets, Francine?

03:27.358 --> 03:31.028
- Three, two, one.
- Three, two, one.

03:43.460 --> 03:46.548
- We totally got you.
- We totally got you.

03:47.800 --> 03:52.889
Allow me to impress upon you
the severe mistake you have made.

03:53.056 --> 03:55.767
For years,
my conduct has been largely benign...

03:55.935 --> 04:00.231
...and yet, without provocation,
you have severed our dÃ©tente...

04:00.398 --> 04:05.864
...and forced me to unleash upon you
the vengeful flames of a thousand suns.

04:06.031 --> 04:09.200
You shall curse your mothers
for the day of your birth.

04:09.367 --> 04:11.620
So go now. Go!

04:11.787 --> 04:14.165
And begin your life of fear...

04:14.332 --> 04:17.000
...knowing that,
when you least expect it...

04:17.168 --> 04:21.298
...the looming sword of Damocles
will crash down upon you...

04:21.466 --> 04:23.259
...cleaving you in twain.

04:23.427 --> 04:26.220
And as you gaze
upon the smoking wreckage...

04:26.388 --> 04:28.015
...that was once your life...

04:28.182 --> 04:34.355
...you will regret the day
you crossed the wrong fish.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.193
He didn't think it was funny.

04:42.283 --> 04:45.620
I found some of Steve and Hayley's
baby clothes in the basement.

04:45.787 --> 04:47.748
I'm gonna bring them
to Greg and Terry's.

04:47.915 --> 04:49.082
Good thinking, Francine.

04:49.249 --> 04:52.336
They can put them on their dog
and forget about this baby thing.

04:52.503 --> 04:54.756
All they wanna do
is dress something up.

04:54.923 --> 04:57.426
No. This is for when
they have their baby.

04:57.593 --> 05:00.430
They're doing a wonderful thing,
and I want them to know...

05:00.597 --> 05:03.433
...that I support them
in this beautiful endeavor.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.604
I couldn't agree more. Just replace
"support" with "condemn"...

05:06.771 --> 05:10.316
...and "beautiful endeavor"
with "horrible abomination."

05:14.821 --> 05:18.034
My shipment of Bavarian chocolate.

05:18.202 --> 05:20.662
Are you crazy?
What if Klaus got to it first?

05:20.828 --> 05:25.001
You heard him.
He wants to cleave us in twain.

05:26.795 --> 05:28.672
It looks like chocolate.

05:28.838 --> 05:31.300
You know what else
looks like chocolate? Poison...

05:31.467 --> 05:34.137
...when dipped in chocolate.

05:34.930 --> 05:35.973
Lovely day.

05:36.139 --> 05:38.559
- Yes, lovely.
- Yes.

05:39.434 --> 05:40.520
He's a psychopath.

05:40.687 --> 05:43.065
- Let's hide in your attic.
- And never go to sleep.

05:43.232 --> 05:47.069
- We could take turns sleeping.
- You are fantastic under pressure.

05:47.486 --> 05:48.529
Stay humble.

05:50.615 --> 05:51.993
Hi, Terry.

05:52.159 --> 05:55.997
I just wanted you guys to know
I think it's great what you're doing...

05:56.163 --> 05:57.707
...and I'm here for you two.

05:57.874 --> 06:02.338
So I brought you some of Steve
and Hayley's old baby clothes.

06:02.505 --> 06:05.550
Thanks, but at this rate,
we're not gonna be having a baby.

06:05.717 --> 06:07.803
Greg keeps shooting down
all our surrogates.

06:07.970 --> 06:10.140
- We're down to two candidates.
- Yellow teeth.

06:10.307 --> 06:13.019
- She's a smoker. She's out.
- Okay, so down to one.

06:13.185 --> 06:17.273
<i>Oh, no. Terry, look. This girl lists
her favorite movie as Erin Brockovich.</i>

06:17.440 --> 06:20.152
Is that the message
you want our baby to absorb in utero?

06:20.319 --> 06:22.654
Show your boobs
to get clean drinking water?

06:22.821 --> 06:24.990
You know what?
I'm exhausted. You exhaust me.

06:25.157 --> 06:27.201
You can't blame him
for being picky, Terry.

06:27.368 --> 06:29.872
You're putting a lot of trust
in a complete stranger.

06:30.039 --> 06:31.874
What are we gonna do?

06:32.041 --> 06:33.459
- I'll do it.
- What?

06:33.625 --> 06:35.879
- I'll carry your baby.
- Really?

06:36.046 --> 06:37.631
It makes perfect sense.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.508
I live right across the street...

06:39.675 --> 06:42.511
...and both pregnancies
were a breeze for me.

06:42.678 --> 06:46.976
Doctor says
I have a big, spongy cervix.

06:47.143 --> 06:49.479
Listen to me
bragging about my vagina.

06:49.646 --> 06:52.983
It's last week's PTA meeting
all over again.

06:58.364 --> 07:00.658
Stan, honey?

07:01.284 --> 07:02.328
Yes?

07:02.495 --> 07:05.123
Remember how I said
I wanted to help Greg and Terry?

07:05.290 --> 07:09.753
Well, a couple weeks ago,
I agreed to be their surrogate...

07:09.920 --> 07:13.007
...and now I'm pregnant
with their baby.

07:30.487 --> 07:34.408
Francine, what the hell?
You have something you wanna tell me?

07:34.575 --> 07:35.618
You need me alive.

07:35.785 --> 07:39.623
I'm the only one who remembers
where you took off your shoes.

07:42.460 --> 07:44.587
We'll tell him later.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.847
You guys have been so great,
making us dinner every night.

07:52.013 --> 07:55.350
And how good do you feel sticking
to the appropriate gay activities...

07:55.517 --> 07:57.270
...instead of that baby nonsense?

07:57.436 --> 08:00.566
And, look, you got to wear an apron.
That's almost a dress.

08:00.732 --> 08:02.776
- I'll clear.
- No, no, no. Let me.

08:02.943 --> 08:05.237
No, no. Let her.
She needs to get some exercise.

08:05.404 --> 08:08.116
Look how fat she is.
My God, you've let yourself go.

08:08.283 --> 08:12.413
You made your point, Francine.
I love you for who you are.

08:12.580 --> 08:15.792
Jeez. I'm gonna
go look at thin women online.

08:15.959 --> 08:18.462
I can't believe you haven't told him
you're pregnant.

08:18.629 --> 08:22.133
- I can't believe Stan hasn't noticed.
- I can't believe a lot of things:

08:22.300 --> 08:25.679
That there's life on Mars,
that someone's married to Larry King...

08:25.846 --> 08:29.142
...that the Harlem Globetrotters
have never lost a ga...

08:29.309 --> 08:33.647
- The baby's kicking.
- Greg, feel.

08:35.107 --> 08:37.068
Oh, God. What does it want?

08:37.235 --> 08:41.405
I can't give it what it wants.
I'm a terrible father. I'm Bing Crosby.

08:44.994 --> 08:47.331
Has this can been out of your sight
at any point?

08:47.497 --> 08:52.962
- No. Yes. No. I can't remember anymore.
- Well, how am I supposed to eat it?

08:54.005 --> 08:57.550
Just sitting here, month after month,
waiting for Klaus' revenge...

08:57.718 --> 08:58.969
...it's maddening.

08:59.136 --> 09:02.599
- I hear something.
- It's him. He's doing it.

09:02.766 --> 09:08.606
Hold on. It was just a spider.
Steve, it was just a spider.

09:11.193 --> 09:13.029
- Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

09:13.196 --> 09:16.157
Wait. Unless he sent the spider...

09:16.324 --> 09:20.245
...to distract us
from what he's doing behind us!

09:20.412 --> 09:23.625
- There's nothing there!
- Yeah, this time!

09:24.166 --> 09:26.419
My son hasn't been to school
in six months?

09:26.586 --> 09:29.298
I'm sure that's not right. You...
Oh, I have another call.

09:29.465 --> 09:31.385
Hold on. Or don't.
I'm not coming back.

09:31.968 --> 09:33.177
Hello?

09:33.344 --> 09:34.888
Test results?

09:35.055 --> 09:37.600
But my wife's far too fat
to be pregnant.

09:37.767 --> 09:41.271
Okay, let's play the CD
your daddies bought for you.

09:46.945 --> 09:50.282
You sleep in a stomach.

09:52.868 --> 09:56.206
Outside a stomach.

09:56.373 --> 10:00.710
Your doctor called. He said the baby
you're carrying for two gay men is fine...

10:00.877 --> 10:02.547
...and you should be very excited.

10:02.713 --> 10:05.217
Do you know how many babies
are born without an anus?

10:05.384 --> 10:07.219
That's it. No more WebMD for you.

10:07.386 --> 10:08.847
You impregnated my wife.

10:09.013 --> 10:11.266
And now I'm gonna kick
your tight little asses.

10:11.432 --> 10:13.685
Oh, you want some? Rumble, Terry.

10:29.204 --> 10:32.040
Stop dancing so I can hit you.

10:33.293 --> 10:35.212
This fight is unbearably campy.

10:35.838 --> 10:37.505
Stan, leave them alone.

10:37.672 --> 10:41.469
They didn't ask me to be their surrogate.
I offered.

10:41.636 --> 10:44.557
I'm proud of what I'm doing,
and you should be too.

10:44.724 --> 10:47.852
Well, I'm not. I think what's going on
in there is wrong.

10:48.019 --> 10:50.021
I think what's going on in there
is wrong.

10:50.188 --> 10:53.401
So taking what's in there
and raising it in there is super-wrong.

10:53.568 --> 10:56.779
Well, it's happening
whether you like it or not.

10:56.946 --> 10:59.032
Francine!

10:59.658 --> 11:01.118
- Did we miss the rumble?
- Yes.

11:01.285 --> 11:04.288
Oh, you had to go back
and change your belt.

11:05.539 --> 11:09.462
Francine, you are single-handedly
bringing on the downfall of society.

11:09.629 --> 11:12.591
It's my body, it's my decision.

11:12.758 --> 11:16.553
You accused Greg and Terry of creating
a bad environment for this child.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.556
You're the one
who's stressing Mom out.

11:18.723 --> 11:20.475
- That's not good for the baby.
- But...

11:20.642 --> 11:23.603
Do you wanna be responsible
for hurting an unborn life? Do you?

11:23.770 --> 11:25.898
- No.
- Stop thinking of yourself...

11:26.065 --> 11:28.818
...and start thinking about
what's best for the baby.

11:34.951 --> 11:38.163
Honey, I'm sorry.
Whether I like it or not, you're pregnant.

11:38.330 --> 11:41.041
And I have to start thinking about
the baby's well-being.

11:41.208 --> 11:43.628
So from now on,
we're in this together.

11:43.795 --> 11:48.385
- Stan, I'm using the bathroom.
- Then I too will use the bathroom.

11:48.551 --> 11:51.261
Oh, Stan.

12:08.574 --> 12:10.160
Okay, camera's rolling.

12:10.327 --> 12:12.622
And here we have
our two big manly men...

12:12.789 --> 12:14.332
...building the baby's crib.

12:14.499 --> 12:17.460
<i>I feel like I'm Tim Allen.</i>

12:18.545 --> 12:21.298
<i>- Guys, my water broke.
- What?</i>

12:23.510 --> 12:26.346
<i>- Okay, here we go.
- Oh, no. No, no. I'm not ready.</i>

12:26.513 --> 12:28.349
<i>No, no, no.</i>

12:28.516 --> 12:31.311
<i>No, no, no.</i>

12:31.478 --> 12:34.857
<i>- Greg, get in the car.
- No, no, no.</i>

12:35.023 --> 12:36.817
<i>Greg.</i>

12:36.984 --> 12:39.237
<i>- Greg.
- No!</i>

12:39.404 --> 12:40.739
<i>Remember when you thought...</i>

12:40.906 --> 12:43.617
<i>... you couldn 't wade through the foam
on the dance floor?</i>

12:43.784 --> 12:47.539
<i>Well, you did that,
and you can do this.</i>

12:48.290 --> 12:51.210
Okay, it's my turn to stand watch.
You can take your nap.

12:51.377 --> 12:53.379
Pretty eager for me to go to sleep.

12:53.546 --> 12:55.632
- So tell me, how's he been?
- How's who been?

12:55.799 --> 12:57.217
You're working with the fish.

12:57.384 --> 12:59.554
Me? How do I know
you're not working with him?

12:59.721 --> 13:01.764
I'll tell you how.

13:09.357 --> 13:11.568
- Look at us.
- We've gone crazy.

13:11.735 --> 13:14.655
- We can't live like this anymore.
- We have to confront Klaus.

13:14.822 --> 13:17.409
Yes. We must confront him.

13:17.576 --> 13:22.331
Is this an accurate mirror?
Look how long my arms are. Disgusting.

13:22.498 --> 13:25.460
Face saves it, though.
Face is glorious.

13:25.627 --> 13:29.048
Steve, I want you to lean over
and kiss my chest.

13:30.049 --> 13:31.508
Stay in the mirror.

13:35.514 --> 13:36.557
It's a girl.

13:36.724 --> 13:39.393
- It's a girl.
- It's a girl.

13:41.021 --> 13:44.984
- She's beautiful. Oh, Greg, here.
- No, no, no.

13:45.151 --> 13:47.570
I am in love with this baby.

13:47.737 --> 13:50.574
Stan, look at my precious little gift
from heaven.

13:50.741 --> 13:52.451
Oh, Terry, thank you.

13:52.618 --> 13:57.165
Stop. You were great. We all were:
You, me, Francine, Stan.

13:57.332 --> 13:59.042
Stan? Where's Stan?

14:01.671 --> 14:04.841
Don't you worry, little girl.
We're gonna find you a real home.

14:10.890 --> 14:12.810
<i>And now the Channel 3 Noon Report...</i>

14:12.977 --> 14:15.479
<i>... with anchor partners Greg Corbin
and Terry Bates.</i>

14:15.646 --> 14:19.359
A baby was reported missing today
from Langley Memorial Hospital.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.696
- The incident occurred at...
- He took our baby!

14:21.862 --> 14:24.323
- He just took her!
- Get a picture of her on-screen.

14:24.490 --> 14:26.575
- I don't have a picture.
- Then describe her.

14:26.743 --> 14:28.787
- She looks like an angel.
- What am I doing?

14:28.954 --> 14:31.582
I was a reporter, for God's sakes.
I'll track her down.

14:31.749 --> 14:34.460
- You were a food critic.
- You don't think I can find her?

14:34.627 --> 14:37.756
<i>I found a decent beignet at the airport,
I can find a baby.</i>

14:37.965 --> 14:40.802
I can't believe
your father would do something like this.

14:40.969 --> 14:42.929
- I can.
- Yeah, I guess I can too.

14:43.096 --> 14:45.224
I don't know why I said that.

14:45.391 --> 14:46.976
- Hello?
- Francine, it's me.

14:47.143 --> 14:49.354
- Stan, where are you?
- I'm here with Liberty.

14:49.521 --> 14:50.938
- Who?
- Liberty Belle.

14:51.106 --> 14:53.066
It's the name I gave
the baby I'm saving.

14:53.233 --> 14:56.946
Poor girl, I think she's slow.
She's just staring at her cheeseburger.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.866
- Stan, you bring her back right now.
- Sorry, Francine.

15:00.033 --> 15:03.663
I've prayed on this. I'm taking her
to Nebraska to put her up for adoption.

15:03.830 --> 15:06.500
What? You can't give
someone else's baby away.

15:06.667 --> 15:10.504
Nebraska begs to differ.
Gay couples have no legal rights there.

15:10.671 --> 15:12.173
Once I cross that state line...

15:12.339 --> 15:14.718
...Greg and Terry
can kiss their custody goodbye.

15:14.885 --> 15:16.971
You're never gonna
get away with this, Stan.

15:17.138 --> 15:19.849
You know I'm gonna tell them.
Why would you even call me?

15:20.016 --> 15:22.770
Something hard and black
fell off the baby's bellybutton.

15:22.936 --> 15:24.939
I thought it was beef jerky, and...

15:25.106 --> 15:27.734
Am I gonna die,
or am I stronger than ever?

15:31.155 --> 15:33.616
Okay, you win. Just do it already.

15:33.784 --> 15:35.702
- Do what?
- Get your revenge.

15:35.869 --> 15:40.166
- The water slide? The practical joke?
- Oh, yes. I had forgotten.

15:40.333 --> 15:42.668
Good. Good. Good. Us too.

15:42.835 --> 15:45.463
But now that you have reminded me...

15:45.630 --> 15:50.804
...the humiliation I suffered that day
will not go unpunished.

15:50.970 --> 15:54.182
My pain is the bubbling caldron
of molten steel...

15:54.349 --> 15:57.144
...that will forge the saber
of your demise.

15:57.311 --> 16:04.110
I shall not be denied my vengeance!

16:08.158 --> 16:10.787
Don't know why we didn't think of that
nine months ago.

16:12.080 --> 16:15.875
Thirty dollars on 2, and a cup of coffee
for the baby. She keeps dozing off.

16:16.042 --> 16:19.756
It's been 19 hours. We're still looking
for the man who kidnapped our baby.

16:19.923 --> 16:23.093
If any of our brethren in
the Rainbow Truckers Brigade spot him...

16:23.260 --> 16:24.511
...please try to stop him.

16:24.678 --> 16:28.182
They were recently seen
at the Stuckey's off Interstate 280.

16:28.349 --> 16:30.935
Liberty, they're onto us.
When will I learn?

16:31.102 --> 16:34.857
Every time I let a man take a picture
of me in a bathroom, it goes bad.

16:38.737 --> 16:40.405
We're nearly to Nebraska, Liberty.

16:40.572 --> 16:42.741
Fifty miles
to the freedom of an orphanage...

16:42.908 --> 16:44.953
...where we'll get you
some real parents.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.998
Hey, look, the heartland's on our side.

17:04.685 --> 17:06.936
The Rainbow Truckers.

17:23.415 --> 17:25.460
- Get on.
- Who are you?

17:25.626 --> 17:26.753
A friend.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.881
Hold on.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.551
Or my waist.

17:35.848 --> 17:37.516
I can't thank you enough, Lily.

17:37.683 --> 17:41.104
Well, when Al and I heard about you
on TV, we knew we had to help.

17:41.271 --> 17:42.815
Jason, this is Stan and Liberty.

17:42.981 --> 17:45.359
- They're gonna stay for dinner.
- Nice to meet you.

17:45.526 --> 17:47.863
Well, that's a good, strong handshake,
young man.

17:48.030 --> 17:49.990
<i>You remind me
of the kid from Old Yeller.</i>

17:50.157 --> 17:52.493
- Let's go shoot your dog.
- I don't have a dog.

17:52.659 --> 17:54.746
We'll get you one,
and then we'll shoot it.

17:56.498 --> 17:58.417
Stan, this is my daughter, Mary.

17:58.584 --> 18:03.047
Oh, a baby. I love babies.
Jesus was a baby.

18:03.215 --> 18:06.677
Yes, he was.
And he was also a murder victim.

18:06.844 --> 18:11.224
Oh, Al's home.
Kids, go wash up for dinner.

18:11.432 --> 18:14.937
Lily, you have fantastic children,
a beautiful home.

18:15.104 --> 18:18.149
I can't wait to meet your husband
and shake his hand.

18:18.651 --> 18:20.527
Hi, honey.

18:20.693 --> 18:21.862
I see you found him.

18:22.029 --> 18:24.323
Sir, I must tell you,
you have a lovely family.

18:24.491 --> 18:25.867
You're a lucky man.

18:26.034 --> 18:28.787
Actually, "Al" is short for "Alison."
I'm a woman.

18:28.954 --> 18:30.998
Right. You know,
I love long hair on a man.

18:31.165 --> 18:34.378
Grown-up Jesus had long hair,
but his breasts weren't as luscious...

18:34.545 --> 18:37.215
- Holy shit, you're a woman!
- Yes. Lily's my partner.

18:37.381 --> 18:40.426
- We're a lesbian couple.
- Oh, my God. Does Al know?

18:40.593 --> 18:44.098
Stan, we thought if we showed you
how happy and healthy our family is...

18:44.265 --> 18:48.310
...you'd see that there's nothing wrong
with a gay couple raising children.

18:49.104 --> 18:51.481
I don't know what to say.
I was wrong.

18:51.648 --> 18:55.320
You've really opened my eyes. I'm just
gonna go change Liberty real quick...

18:55.487 --> 18:58.782
...and then we'll all sit down
to a beautiful meal.

18:59.449 --> 19:04.622
See, honey? We enlightened a bigot.
We just made the world a little better.

19:04.789 --> 19:06.791
We could have turned him in
to the cops...

19:06.958 --> 19:09.420
...but that would've just created
another monster.

19:09.587 --> 19:13.593
- Instead, we changed a mind.
- We changed a heart.

19:13.758 --> 19:17.847
This is why we left Reseda.
This, right here.

19:20.017 --> 19:21.727
Let me see if I got this right.

19:21.894 --> 19:25.398
You kidnapped us from a loving home
and are taking us to an orphanage?

19:25.565 --> 19:27.108
Yes. Your nightmare is over.

19:27.275 --> 19:30.738
It might take years, but maybe someday
a straight family will adopt you.

19:30.904 --> 19:35.035
But we already have a family,
and you said we're a great family.

19:35.201 --> 19:37.705
You seemed like a great family,
but you can't be.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.540
There's two mothers and no father.

19:39.707 --> 19:41.959
Jason, who's gonna teach you
to play football?

19:42.126 --> 19:44.921
- My football coach.
- Well, okay, that could work.

19:45.088 --> 19:48.843
Mary, who's gonna carry you on their
shoulders so you can see the parade?

19:49.010 --> 19:51.721
My mom. She's 6 feet in heels.

19:52.890 --> 19:57.187
- Move your stupid doll. It's in my space.
- She's not stupid, you're stupid.

19:57.354 --> 19:59.522
- She's my doll. Give her back.
- Give me that.

19:59.689 --> 20:04.988
Steve, Hayley, knock it off. I mean...
Wait. You fight just like my kids.

20:05.155 --> 20:09.743
- Just like normal kids.
- We are normal kids, you moron.

20:13.831 --> 20:17.461
And none of the horses
are eating each other.

20:26.097 --> 20:28.933
Oh, no. Why'd he stop?

20:31.269 --> 20:32.772
- Mom.
- Mommies.

20:32.939 --> 20:35.357
- Our angel.
- I'm sorry, guys.

20:35.525 --> 20:40.614
I was wrong. Raising kids doesn't take
straight parents, it takes loving parents.

20:40.781 --> 20:44.285
So I'm gonna take a chance
and let you guys raise your own child.

20:44.451 --> 20:47.998
Come on, give me a hug.
You know you want to.

20:49.250 --> 20:51.461
That wasn't campy at all.

20:54.673 --> 20:56.508
Oh, she is so cute.

20:56.675 --> 20:59.804
- Don't forget, you're gonna babysit.
- We don't need a babysitter.

20:59.972 --> 21:03.100
With her at home,
why would we ever wanna leave?

21:04.101 --> 21:06.896
- Did she smile when I said that?
- No.

21:07.063 --> 21:09.066
You ever gonna drop
the restraining order?

21:09.233 --> 21:10.317
No.

21:10.484 --> 21:12.862
She likes sugar in her coffee.

21:48.487 --> 21:50.574
