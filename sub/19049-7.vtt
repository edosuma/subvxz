WEBVTT

00:01.843 --> 00:02.710
I'm so pumped, dude.

00:02.778 --> 00:04.812
I hope I get to see at
least one ancient spirit.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.848
I think we should get
some chalk and some erasers,

00:06.916 --> 00:10.118
because that dust cloud, you know,
really shows the laser beam alarms.

00:10.185 --> 00:11.553
Oh!
Get a little dust cloud going.

00:11.620 --> 00:14.355
We got to spend a lot of
time in the Civil War section.

00:14.423 --> 00:16.056
No, we're not doing
the Civil War section, Frank.

00:16.125 --> 00:17.592
We are gonna hit up
Ancient Egypt though.

00:17.660 --> 00:18.459
I'm very excited about that.

00:18.527 --> 00:19.294
And we're sticking together.

00:19.361 --> 00:21.963
SWEET DEE: Just so I'm clear,
you guys don't actually think

00:22.031 --> 00:24.632
that things are going to come
alive because you're spending

00:24.700 --> 00:26.134
the night in a museum, right?

00:26.201 --> 00:28.369
I'm sorry, but we're
simply opening ourselves up to

00:28.437 --> 00:30.738
the possibility of an amazing
adventure this evening.

00:30.806 --> 00:32.073
Is there something wrong with that?

00:32.141 --> 00:34.275
Now, whether that means, uh,
Charlie running into his ancient

00:34.343 --> 00:37.984
spirits or us having to just, you know, run
away from security guards all night,

00:38.104 --> 00:39.563
It's gonna be a really really great time.

00:39.683 --> 00:41.772
It's certainly gonna be better
than sticking around alone all night,

00:41.892 --> 00:44.327
watching you eat sandwich
after sandwich after sandwich.

00:44.447 --> 00:45.987
What the hell is the matter with you?

00:46.226 --> 00:47.851
You've been stuffing your face for days.

00:47.971 --> 00:49.440
It's fatness, Frank.
Plain and simple.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.069
The person's becoming fat
in front of your eyes.

00:51.189 --> 00:53.639
I don't even know how to make
the bird jokes anymore,

00:53.759 --> 00:56.323
- like they don't apply.
- I'm not fat. I'm pregnant.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.319
I feel like you say that all the time now.

00:59.439 --> 01:01.546
You better do yourself a favor
and flush it out.

01:01.666 --> 01:04.292
Wait a second. You definitely
said that before. You're right.

01:04.412 --> 01:07.036
Yeah, and since we're all saying
things that we say all the time

01:07.156 --> 01:09.792
I'll reiterate. Dee, we don't care
about you or your body,

01:09.912 --> 01:12.758
or your baby, or that baby bird you're
probably carrying inside of you.

01:13.312 --> 01:14.297
Oh, really?

01:14.417 --> 01:15.634
Well you should give a shit,

01:15.754 --> 01:17.147
'cause one of you is the father.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.857
- What?
- W-What the hell you talking about?

01:20.977 --> 01:22.137
I'm talking about the Halloween party.

01:22.257 --> 01:23.579
One of you got me pregnant.

01:23.841 --> 01:27.777
But you know, since you guys don't care about
me or my body or my baby or whatever it was

01:27.897 --> 01:29.564
that you were saying, we
shouldn't talk about it.

01:29.684 --> 01:31.836
You guys are on your way to a
museum to spend the night.

01:31.956 --> 01:33.644
Hey, have a great time, guys.

01:37.429 --> 01:38.568
Oh, shit.

02:12.130 --> 02:13.497
I mean, what is
she even talking about?

02:13.565 --> 02:15.132
Got her pregnant at
the Halloween party?

02:15.200 --> 02:15.833
What does that mean?

02:15.901 --> 02:17.501
I don't even remember
that party; I was wasted.

02:17.569 --> 02:18.402
Yeah, me, too.

02:18.470 --> 02:20.171
I-I browned out that evening.

02:20.238 --> 02:21.038
Browned out?

02:21.106 --> 02:22.206
What's browned out?

02:22.274 --> 02:25.576
Oh, it's when you drink so
much that everything goes brown.

02:25.577 --> 02:28.412
It's not as severe as a blackout,
'cause I remember bits and pieces.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.747
I like to call it browning out.

02:29.815 --> 02:31.515
Hmm, never
heard of that before.

02:31.583 --> 02:33.050
There's a good
reason for that, Frank.

02:33.118 --> 02:34.852
Because I think Mac just
made it up on the spot.

02:34.920 --> 02:35.386
I did.

02:35.453 --> 02:35.953
You did?

02:36.521 --> 02:38.055
That's a great term... browning out.

02:38.123 --> 02:38.656
You like it?

02:38.723 --> 02:39.256
I love it!

02:39.324 --> 02:39.757
Thank you.

02:39.825 --> 02:42.726
And I-I'm pretty sure at a certain
point, we all probably browned out.

02:42.794 --> 02:45.129
So I think our best chance at
figuring this out is for us to

02:45.197 --> 02:47.965
all put our browns together,
mash them together and try and

02:48.033 --> 02:49.767
figure out which one of
you two banged my sister.

02:49.835 --> 02:51.402
Okay, but let's not over use
the brown thing right in

02:51.469 --> 02:52.002
the beginning, you know.

02:52.070 --> 02:53.370
Yeah, but here's the thing.

02:53.438 --> 02:55.339
Once you throw a term like that
out and everybody likes it, it's

02:55.407 --> 02:55.973
pretty much fair game.

02:56.041 --> 02:58.042
- We can use it whenever...
- It's public domain at that point.

02:58.109 --> 02:59.210
It becomes public domain.

02:59.277 --> 03:01.345
Now we're just trying
to figure out who banged Dee.

03:01.413 --> 03:02.646
That's the important thing.

03:02.714 --> 03:04.615
Let's not focus too much on the
brown thing... Even though it's a

03:04.683 --> 03:05.683
term that I'm gonna use a lot.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.451
And I'm probably gonna
use it a lot right now.

03:07.519 --> 03:09.587
So here's what I remember
from my brown state.

03:09.654 --> 03:12.056
I remember we were all in
costume, and our costumes were

03:12.123 --> 03:14.491
pretty cool, except for yours.

03:14.559 --> 03:18.362
I was really pissed off at you, because
we agreed to go as Mario and Luigi.

03:18.430 --> 03:20.264
I held up my end of the bargain.

03:20.332 --> 03:23.868
And then you showed up wearing a
different costume at the last minute.

03:23.935 --> 03:24.902
Dude, what are you doing?

03:24.970 --> 03:26.103
Where's your Mario costume?

03:26.171 --> 03:28.038
No, I went with a sexier look.

03:28.106 --> 03:28.739
Sexy?

03:28.807 --> 03:31.197
Bro, we agreed on funny over sexy this
year,

03:31.317 --> 03:32.709
so we could disarm the ladies...

03:32.829 --> 03:34.151
You don't remember this conversation?

03:34.271 --> 03:35.347
Without my Mario...

03:35.467 --> 03:37.514
What am I? Like some weird
Italian plumber.

03:37.582 --> 03:38.782
I look like an asshole.

03:38.850 --> 03:39.483
What is that?

03:39.551 --> 03:40.384
What even is that?

03:40.452 --> 03:43.754
<i>I'm that character from Lord
of the Rings, Viggio Morgenstein.</i>

03:43.822 --> 03:45.890
Okay, that is not the
character's name, that's the

03:45.957 --> 03:47.791
actor's name, and you're not
even getting that right.

03:47.859 --> 03:50.461
You're totally, totally
boning me here, bro.

03:50.528 --> 03:51.095
You realize that?

03:51.162 --> 03:51.795
Yo, yo, yo!

03:51.863 --> 03:53.731
Look at the turnout for our partay.

03:53.798 --> 03:55.199
Fizz! Fizz!

03:55.267 --> 03:57.434
I vant to suck your blood!

03:57.502 --> 03:58.869
<i>It's Tvilight time!</i>

03:58.937 --> 04:00.471
Time for blood sucking.

04:01.673 --> 04:04.141
Yeah, dude, I'm doing a vampire
thing, 'cause chicks are all

04:04.209 --> 04:06.277
into vampires and stuff, you
know, 'cause of the stupid

04:06.344 --> 04:07.745
<i>Twilight movie and all
that other crap.</i>

04:07.812 --> 04:10.014
You know, so I'm like, what
if the waitress is into it?

04:10.081 --> 04:11.081
This is my best shot!

04:11.149 --> 04:12.950
You are dressed like
the Phantom of the Opera.

04:13.018 --> 04:13.717
He's not a vampire.

04:13.785 --> 04:14.885
He eats theater people.

04:14.953 --> 04:15.586
No, he doesn't.

04:15.654 --> 04:16.353
I think he might.

04:16.421 --> 04:16.987
He does.

04:17.055 --> 04:19.523
And I'm surprised you even
know who the Phantom of the Opera is.

04:19.591 --> 04:20.124
He might not.

04:20.190 --> 04:20.757
He doesn't.

04:20.825 --> 04:21.992
No, I don't, I don't.

04:22.060 --> 04:23.260
SWEET DEE: This party blows.

04:23.328 --> 04:24.094
There's no studs here.

04:24.162 --> 04:25.796
No beef in the freezer,
if you know what I mean.

04:25.864 --> 04:29.466
Dee, why in God's name would you
wear a costume with giant wings?

04:29.534 --> 04:30.434
SWEET DEE: I'm a sexy angel.

04:30.502 --> 04:33.304
Are we supposed to pretend like
you're not dressed like a giant bird?

04:33.371 --> 04:35.706
I mean, if you're gonna be
sexy, don't dress like a bird, Dee.

04:35.774 --> 04:38.409
SWEET DEE: I didn't dress like
a bird, I'm clearly an angel.

04:38.476 --> 04:38.909
No.

04:38.977 --> 04:40.978
SWEET DEE: Besides, did you
guys see that cooze over there,

04:41.046 --> 04:42.713
dressing like a peacock?

04:42.781 --> 04:44.014
Big, giant bird.

04:44.082 --> 04:45.115
Green bird.

04:47.652 --> 04:48.986
She wears it well.

04:49.054 --> 04:49.853
Woof, woof.

04:49.921 --> 04:51.455
She wears it very well.

04:51.523 --> 04:53.824
She wears it so well, in fact,
that I have now pinpointed her

04:53.892 --> 04:55.159
as my prey for the evening.

04:55.226 --> 04:55.993
Yeah.

04:56.061 --> 04:58.028
She will be mine.

04:58.096 --> 05:00.698
As a matter of fact, I'm gonna go
get that process started right now.

05:00.765 --> 05:02.466
Out of my way, bird.

05:02.534 --> 05:04.639
This is all sounding right.

05:04.759 --> 05:07.785
- I remember this.
- Yeah? Does all this seem right to you?

05:07.905 --> 05:09.191
So it was later in the evening and

05:09.430 --> 05:10.675
and things have progressed quite a bit

05:10.795 --> 05:13.685
cause I remember we all got
pretty lit at this point. But...

05:14.107 --> 05:17.866
See, I distinctly remember being some kind
of a commotion at the other end of the bar.

05:18.105 --> 05:20.750
Leave us alone. Stop it!

05:20.870 --> 05:23.817
Now this lady sounded like she was
in a fair amount of distress, but...

05:24.084 --> 05:25.287
I didn't really give a shit.

05:25.407 --> 05:27.439
Cause despite looking
like a cartoon bricklayer

05:27.847 --> 05:32.398
I was started to get pretty close
to sealing the deal with the peacock lady.

05:32.518 --> 05:34.649
Look, dude.
You've been bugging me all night.

05:34.769 --> 05:37.473
OK, I think your costume's weird,
I think you're creepy,

05:37.593 --> 05:41.085
- and I just want you to leave me alone.
- Yeah.

05:41.549 --> 05:42.815
Yes...

05:43.638 --> 05:45.861
Dude, this costume is so sexy.

05:45.981 --> 05:47.802
- What?
- I can't believe it, man.

05:47.922 --> 05:49.599
***. She's like...

05:49.719 --> 05:52.901
"Oh, my God, you look so sexy.
I'm gonna sex you all up."

05:53.021 --> 05:54.232
"Oh, my goodness...

05:54.352 --> 05:55.419
Get your sex off me!"

05:55.487 --> 05:58.322
And then she gets all sexy with
me, 'cause I've, like, got the

05:58.390 --> 05:59.890
sexiest costume in the world!

05:59.958 --> 06:00.791
I hate it!

06:00.859 --> 06:03.093
So what-what... did you
want to get rid of that costume?

06:03.161 --> 06:04.628
Yes, I want to
get rid of the costume!

06:04.696 --> 06:06.363
You have any idea what
it's like to be this sexy?

06:06.431 --> 06:07.765
Uh, can I have
your costume, dude?

06:07.832 --> 06:09.033
Yeah, you can have it.

06:09.100 --> 06:09.533
Really?

06:09.601 --> 06:10.334
You'll switch costumes with me?

06:10.402 --> 06:10.834
Yeah!

06:10.902 --> 06:12.202
Let's switch, let's switch.

06:12.771 --> 06:13.470
Come on, let's go switch.

06:13.538 --> 06:14.571
You'll be okay, buddy.

06:14.639 --> 06:15.272
Yes, dude!

06:15.340 --> 06:16.340
It's all coming back to me now.

06:16.474 --> 06:18.876
You came over to me, we agreed
to switch costumes, you gave me

06:18.943 --> 06:23.981
your sexy, sexy costume, and I was able
to fell the seductive temptress finally.

06:24.049 --> 06:27.084
Oh, yeah, so I did have sex
with the peacock lady.

06:27.152 --> 06:28.285
Yeah, awesome.

06:28.353 --> 06:29.620
Ah, that's so awesome, dude.

06:29.687 --> 06:30.721
Well, mystery solved.

06:30.789 --> 06:33.123
I mean... awesome.

06:33.191 --> 06:34.725
That's not the mystery.

06:34.793 --> 06:35.993
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:36.061 --> 06:38.395
That you banged the peacock
chick is not the mystery.

06:38.463 --> 06:40.531
The Dee thing is the mystery.

06:40.598 --> 06:42.866
Right. Dee... somebody had sex
with Dee, and she got pregnant

06:42.934 --> 06:44.368
and... well, whatever, okay.

06:44.436 --> 06:47.971
Well, clearly, from that story, Charlie,
you're the one that banged her.

06:48.039 --> 06:50.274
That's why you were feeling so
much remorse and regret, and you

06:50.341 --> 06:51.942
had the tears coming out of your eye.

06:52.010 --> 06:55.012
I mean, who wouldn't feel that way
after banging... Ah, shit, dude.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.113
Oh, shit.

06:56.181 --> 06:58.649
'Cause the way you're telling
that story, it definitely sounds

06:58.716 --> 07:02.186
like that, 'cause I remember crying.

07:02.253 --> 07:03.387
No.

07:03.455 --> 07:04.855
Those were tears of joy.

07:04.923 --> 07:07.491
Yes, and it wasn't because
of Dee, obviously.

07:07.559 --> 07:08.692
Okay, I remember this now.

07:08.760 --> 07:09.693
I remember this, all right?

07:09.761 --> 07:11.695
Frank and Artemis were sitting
at the bar, and they were in

07:11.763 --> 07:13.697
the middle of some
kind of big argument.

07:13.765 --> 07:16.266
And I was with the McPoyle
brothers over at the jukebox,

07:16.334 --> 07:19.269
and I just finalized a
delicate truce with them.

07:19.337 --> 07:21.839
So, look, if you guys are
cool, then I'm totally cool.

07:21.906 --> 07:24.041
We're cool as cucumbers.

07:24.109 --> 07:25.109
Bump it.

07:25.176 --> 07:26.210
This time, I will bump it.

07:26.277 --> 07:27.344
The truce is on!

07:27.412 --> 07:29.680
We bumped fists, and Dee walked by.

07:29.747 --> 07:30.681
Oh, hey, Dee.

07:30.748 --> 07:31.682
Hey, Charlie.

07:31.749 --> 07:32.883
Great costume.

07:32.951 --> 07:34.051
Yeah, you, too.

07:34.119 --> 07:35.052
Thanks.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.186
Like the feathers.

07:36.254 --> 07:39.123
And just then, the waitress came in.

07:39.190 --> 07:45.246
Hey... I see you
received my invitation.

07:45.366 --> 07:48.105
Yeah, Charlie, I received all 100 of them.

07:48.225 --> 07:50.934
- Who's this jerk?
- This is my new boyfriend.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.369
He's here to protect me.

07:52.489 --> 07:55.404
Oh, this is the guy
you were telling me about.

07:55.524 --> 07:57.947
Hey. Hey. The lady's taken.

07:58.067 --> 08:00.156
- Get out of my face, bro.
- Oh, really?

08:00.276 --> 08:02.466
You want your ass kicked?

08:02.586 --> 08:03.620
OK, leave us alone.

08:03.740 --> 08:05.319
I have to defend her honor.

08:05.439 --> 08:07.738
- Please, stop it.
- Mac, get my back.

08:08.128 --> 08:10.379
Ohh!

08:10.499 --> 08:11.722
Oh, Goddamn it!

08:11.789 --> 08:14.124
I got milk all over me!

08:14.192 --> 08:18.587
That was insanely masculine.

08:19.898 --> 08:20.831
I made out with the waitress!

08:20.899 --> 08:21.832
That's amazing!

08:21.900 --> 08:23.834
Man, I got to call her, or I'm...
I'm out of here.

08:23.902 --> 08:24.835
Charlie, didn't happen.

08:24.903 --> 08:25.836
No?

08:25.904 --> 08:27.838
That's not the way it happened.

08:27.906 --> 08:28.839
No?

08:28.907 --> 08:31.842
No. You got parts of it right, but
you're leaving out some major things.

08:31.910 --> 08:34.878
Let me set the damn record straight.

08:34.946 --> 08:37.780
First of all, don't say
I went as Spider-Man.

08:37.849 --> 08:38.948
I didn't go as Spider-Man.

08:39.017 --> 08:40.517
I was Man-Spider.

08:40.585 --> 08:41.985
Totally different.

08:42.053 --> 08:44.922
Yes, I was having an argument
with Artemis, because a couple

08:44.989 --> 08:49.660
weeks before, we had some makeup sex in
a Dumpster out in the back of Wendy's.

08:50.962 --> 08:52.296
Yeah! Yeah!

08:52.363 --> 08:56.600
She incorporated a bun
in the lovemaking.

08:56.668 --> 09:00.237
She took the-the...
the dough and rolled it up into a ball,

09:00.305 --> 09:02.706
and then she...
And we were going berserk.

09:02.774 --> 09:05.475
She loves that kind of stuff, and I-I...
I admit I do, too.

09:05.543 --> 09:08.478
Frank, Frank, we don't need to
hear this part of the story.

09:08.546 --> 09:10.480
Okay? Can you just tell
us about Halloween?

09:10.548 --> 09:11.481
Stick to Halloween night.

09:11.549 --> 09:12.482
Okay.

09:12.550 --> 09:15.219
We were arguing because she
wanted another Dumpster hump and

09:15.286 --> 09:16.687
I wanted to stay at the party.

09:16.754 --> 09:17.955
So I walked away.

09:18.022 --> 09:19.957
That's when you were doing your thing.

09:20.024 --> 09:21.225
I'm gonna kick your ass, bro!

09:21.292 --> 09:22.292
Leave us alone.

09:22.360 --> 09:23.860
I have to defend your honor.

09:23.928 --> 09:25.295
Please stop!

09:25.363 --> 09:26.530
Mac, get my back, dude.

09:26.598 --> 09:28.098
I'm here, buddy.

09:29.567 --> 09:30.968
Goddamn it!

09:31.035 --> 09:33.437
I got milk all over me!

09:33.504 --> 09:36.773
You are insane.

09:36.841 --> 09:39.142
Insanely masculine.

09:39.210 --> 09:43.080
It was Artemis that took
advantage of you, because she

09:43.147 --> 09:45.182
was trying to make me jealous.

09:45.250 --> 09:49.586
After you broke free, you wandered off
muttering something about the costume

09:49.654 --> 09:50.854
being too sexy.

09:50.922 --> 09:52.022
Not from you!

09:52.090 --> 09:53.957
It's the stupid sexy costume.

09:54.025 --> 09:55.325
Oh, shit.

09:55.393 --> 09:58.929
Somebody please tell me Frank's
memory is not correct.

10:05.165 --> 10:06.900
Knock, knock, dick faces.

10:06.968 --> 10:09.235
Artie, thanks for coming so quick.

10:09.303 --> 10:12.238
Listen, we're trying to piece together
a night, and we need some guidance.

10:12.306 --> 10:13.373
I don't remember that night.

10:13.441 --> 10:15.375
I didn't tell you which night yet.

10:15.443 --> 10:17.477
I don't remember most evenings.

10:17.545 --> 10:19.579
You can try me, but I will
not promise you anything.

10:19.647 --> 10:20.580
Last Halloween.

10:20.648 --> 10:21.581
Oh, Halloween.

10:21.649 --> 10:22.582
Anything ring a bell?

10:22.650 --> 10:23.583
That was quite a night.

10:23.651 --> 10:26.319
I suppose I do recall a
few bits and pieces.

10:26.387 --> 10:27.454
What happened?

10:27.521 --> 10:28.455
Spill.

10:28.522 --> 10:30.924
Well, I was angry at you
because of an incident that

10:30.992 --> 10:34.060
happened a few weeks before where you and
I were in the Dumpster behind Wendy's.

10:34.128 --> 10:36.429
I incorporated a hamburger bun
in a way that he found very...

10:36.497 --> 10:38.379
This is not the part that we...
why does everybody think

10:38.499 --> 10:41.434
that we want to know about...Because
it's really interesting and innovative,

10:41.502 --> 10:43.436
and I thought maybe you'd
want some lessons.

10:43.504 --> 10:44.671
Did you make out with me?

10:44.739 --> 10:45.672
I sure did.

10:45.740 --> 10:46.773
And it worked like a charm.

10:46.841 --> 10:48.975
I had Frank all to myself for
a month straight after that.

10:49.043 --> 10:50.977
All right, let's get
back to Halloween.

10:51.045 --> 10:52.979
Anything else that
happened that night?

10:53.047 --> 10:54.581
Like Deandra getting pregnant?

10:54.648 --> 10:56.416
Oh, well, that makes sense.

10:56.484 --> 10:59.252
Mac slept with her at the party.

10:59.320 --> 11:00.620
What?

11:00.688 --> 11:01.688
What are you talking about?

11:01.756 --> 11:04.324
I'm talking about the sounds
of hot, passionate lovemaking

11:04.392 --> 11:07.861
that was coming from the bathroom that
I had heard with my own two ear balls.

11:07.928 --> 11:11.698
After the fight and the kiss,
Mac had blood all over his

11:11.766 --> 11:14.534
knuckles and went to the
bathroom to wash it off.

11:14.602 --> 11:17.103
Dee was incensed that her
costume was covered in milk, so

11:17.171 --> 11:20.273
she went to the bathroom
to clean herself up.

11:20.341 --> 11:21.608
But the line for the ladies'

11:21.675 --> 11:24.744
room was too long, so she
went to the men's room.

11:24.812 --> 11:27.480
Frank started to apologize to
me, and after a few minutes, we

11:27.548 --> 11:30.183
decided to have makeup
sex in the men's room.

11:30.251 --> 11:33.686
But the door was locked and I heard the
passionate, unmistakable sounds of

11:33.754 --> 11:35.455
lovemaking coming from inside.

11:35.523 --> 11:38.740
Mac was making love to Sweet Dee
in the bathroom, so Frank and I

11:38.860 --> 11:41.134
had to sneak outside to my station wagon

11:41.254 --> 11:42.823
where we gave each other handjobs.

11:44.365 --> 11:45.799
Well, there you have it.

11:45.866 --> 11:47.367
Mac's the dad.

11:47.435 --> 11:48.902
Mac's the dad!

11:48.969 --> 11:50.036
Do it with me.

11:50.104 --> 11:51.071
Mac's the dad!

11:51.138 --> 11:53.640
No, I'm not the...
I'm not the dad, okay, Charlie?

11:53.707 --> 11:55.175
Just trust me on that.

11:55.242 --> 11:57.210
Hey, all the evidence is
pointing towards you, pal.

11:57.278 --> 12:00.780
Yes, there were passionate
sounds of lovemaking coming from

12:00.848 --> 12:03.583
the bathroom, but it
wasn't me and Dee.

12:03.651 --> 12:04.617
Damn it.

12:04.685 --> 12:08.021
I was hoping I wouldn't have to admit
this, but I guess I have to tell you.

12:09.090 --> 12:10.290
Okay, here it goes.

12:10.357 --> 12:13.460
I was in the back of the bar
when the commotion began, and I

12:13.527 --> 12:15.028
heard Charlie cry out for help.

12:15.096 --> 12:17.464
He was about to get his ass
kicked by that giant dude.

12:17.531 --> 12:18.832
Mac, help me, please!

12:18.899 --> 12:19.833
I need you!

12:19.900 --> 12:21.835
There was no time for
an ocular pat-down.

12:21.902 --> 12:23.736
Not in my bar, bro.

12:23.804 --> 12:26.906
I secured the area,
and I retained order.

12:26.974 --> 12:28.007
Like I always do.

12:28.075 --> 12:29.943
Everybody chill.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.711
It's cool now.

12:35.015 --> 12:37.517
I had a tremendous amount of
douche bag blood all over my

12:37.585 --> 12:40.053
knuckles, so I went to the
bathroom to clean it off.

12:40.121 --> 12:41.387
That's when Dee came in.

12:41.455 --> 12:42.388
Oh, hey, Dee.

12:44.391 --> 12:47.560
Look, I do not give a shit about
your problems, Dee, okay?

12:47.628 --> 12:49.562
I'm still pumped up from that
ass-whupping I just handed out.

12:49.630 --> 12:50.597
Did you see that?

12:51.699 --> 12:53.133
I don't give a shit, Dee, okay?

12:53.200 --> 12:55.135
I don't know how you're going to
get all that milk off of you.

12:56.203 --> 12:57.137
What is that supposed to mean?

12:58.205 --> 12:59.139
Okay, you know what?

12:59.206 --> 13:00.140
Shoo. Shoo.

13:00.207 --> 13:01.141
Get out of here.

13:01.208 --> 13:02.142
Shoo. Shoo!

13:02.209 --> 13:03.143
Get out of here.

13:03.210 --> 13:04.144
Shoo. Shoo. Shoo.

13:04.211 --> 13:05.145
Come on. Get out.

13:05.212 --> 13:06.146
Get out.

13:06.213 --> 13:07.447
Oh, so annoying.

13:07.515 --> 13:08.615
Whoa!

13:08.682 --> 13:11.217
Margaret, what are you doing here?

13:11.285 --> 13:13.052
God, that is so gross.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.120
You're always doing that.

13:14.188 --> 13:16.122
Are you trying to tell me something?

13:16.190 --> 13:17.123
Ugh.

13:17.191 --> 13:20.860
Is that, like, a sexual thing?

13:20.928 --> 13:23.596
All right, let's do this.

13:25.399 --> 13:26.499
Hold on a second.

13:26.567 --> 13:30.336
So, are you telling us that you had
sex with Margaret McPoyle that night?

13:30.404 --> 13:31.504
Yes.

13:32.573 --> 13:33.506
Yeah.

13:33.574 --> 13:36.509
Well, you know, we got to go confront
the McPoyles about this now.

13:36.577 --> 13:38.511
Yeah, we got to confirm
this whole story.

13:38.579 --> 13:40.513
The only consistent part about
every single one of these

13:40.581 --> 13:42.515
stories is that the McPoyles
were there and they were

13:42.583 --> 13:44.538
drinking milk, which means they
were stone-cold sober that night.

13:44.658 --> 13:45.944
They could probably confirm the truth.

13:46.338 --> 13:48.421
Ah, shit.

13:54.461 --> 13:58.614
Last Halloween, huh?
And Dee's pregnant, huh?

14:00.442 --> 14:02.368
I remember that night well.

14:02.436 --> 14:04.771
As do I. Quite well.

14:04.838 --> 14:07.373
You were all very, very, very drunk.

14:07.441 --> 14:08.274
Quite drunk.

14:08.342 --> 14:09.409
You should feel shame.

14:09.476 --> 14:11.010
Okay, don't give us your
judgements, all right?

14:11.078 --> 14:12.679
Can you please just tell
us what you remember?

14:12.746 --> 14:13.446
Tell us what happened.

14:13.514 --> 14:16.950
Well, we just finished accepting
Charles's terrible, terrible truce.

14:17.017 --> 14:18.418
That's like the whole truce.

14:18.485 --> 14:20.186
You know, that's all there is to it.

14:20.254 --> 14:23.423
And if you guys are cool with it,
then I'll be perfectly cool with it.

14:23.490 --> 14:24.257
Whatever.

14:24.325 --> 14:25.091
Just get out of our face.

14:25.159 --> 14:25.992
Your breath is awful.

14:26.060 --> 14:26.693
Really?

14:26.760 --> 14:27.360
Yeah.

14:27.428 --> 14:28.494
All right, well, bump it?

14:28.562 --> 14:29.762
What about this one?

14:29.830 --> 14:30.964
Do you bump?

14:31.031 --> 14:32.265
That's cool.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.534
Cool guys.

14:34.602 --> 14:36.769
Good truce, good truce,
good truce, good truce.

14:36.837 --> 14:37.870
Ah, hey, Dee.

14:37.938 --> 14:39.072
Shut up.

14:39.139 --> 14:41.174
Yep, yep.

14:41.242 --> 14:43.309
Uh, hello, hello, hello, hello.

14:43.377 --> 14:46.946
I see you received my invitation.

14:47.014 --> 14:48.348
Sorry, do I know you?

14:48.415 --> 14:49.415
Who's this jerk?

14:49.483 --> 14:51.251
Uh, this is my boyfriend.

14:51.318 --> 14:52.185
What the hell?!

14:52.253 --> 14:53.253
Whoa. Time out, buddy.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.254
What's going on here?

14:54.321 --> 14:55.788
The lady's taken, buddy.

14:55.856 --> 14:57.290
Who are you?

14:57.358 --> 14:59.125
You want to get your ass kicked?

14:59.193 --> 15:00.026
Leave us alone!

15:00.094 --> 15:02.228
I have to defend your honor!

15:02.296 --> 15:05.064
Mac, get my back!

15:07.568 --> 15:10.937
Goddamnit!
I got milk all over me!

15:11.005 --> 15:12.939
Viggio Morgenstein!

15:14.499 --> 15:16.175
Hey.

15:16.243 --> 15:19.646
I'm insanely high on mescaline.

15:19.713 --> 15:22.682
Are you telling me that
wasn't even the waitress?

15:22.750 --> 15:24.117
Not at all.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.886
After the fight, Mac went to
the bathroom to wash that poor

15:26.954 --> 15:28.788
girl's blood off his hands.

15:28.856 --> 15:30.657
And Dee followed.

15:30.724 --> 15:35.094
They were only in there a short moment
together before Dee came back out.

15:35.162 --> 15:37.664
Mac kicked her out of the
bathroom so he could make sweet

15:37.731 --> 15:39.966
love to Margaret in private.

15:40.034 --> 15:43.436
I heard you gave quite a
performance, Macwell.

15:46.740 --> 15:49.075
Mm...

15:49.143 --> 15:55.315
Mm... mmm...
Okay, that's enough, all right?

15:55.382 --> 15:56.516
God, that's your sister.

15:56.583 --> 15:57.884
Yeah.

15:57.951 --> 15:59.860
You know what, just move past it.
Just tell the story, please.

16:00.354 --> 16:01.688
She's still expecting a call.

16:01.755 --> 16:02.955
That's not going to happen.

16:03.023 --> 16:04.157
So just move past it, all right?

16:04.224 --> 16:06.559
You will call her!

16:06.627 --> 16:09.262
Jesus, man, I'm sorry.

16:09.330 --> 16:11.130
Fine, I'll call her.

16:11.198 --> 16:12.292
As I was saying...

16:12.412 --> 16:14.542
Dee came out of the bathroom
in quite a rage.

16:15.119 --> 16:16.681
Stupid costume.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.425
Everybody calling me a bird.

16:19.039 --> 16:21.407
She accosted the girl you
were all ogling that evening.

16:21.475 --> 16:24.143
Hey, you, everybody thinks
you're so hot, huh?

16:24.211 --> 16:25.445
You big hot bird.

16:25.512 --> 16:28.214
Well, I tell you what... you
take it off and switch with me.

16:28.282 --> 16:30.016
What are you talking about?

16:30.084 --> 16:31.284
Me, mine... this is mine now.

16:31.352 --> 16:32.151
Switch it.

16:32.219 --> 16:33.286
Uh, I don't think so.

16:33.354 --> 16:34.787
"Oh, I don't think so."

16:34.855 --> 16:36.055
I didn't ask you, okay?

16:36.123 --> 16:40.360
Listen, all right, number one,
it's a win-win for both of us.

16:40.427 --> 16:43.329
That weird plumber... he's going to leave
you alone for the rest of the night.

16:43.397 --> 16:44.364
That's good, right?

16:44.431 --> 16:46.399
And then the second great thing
for you is I'm not going to beat

16:46.467 --> 16:48.568
the shit out of you, so let's go.

16:48.635 --> 16:52.004
Dee came out of the bathroom in her
new costume feeling quite saucy.

16:52.072 --> 16:53.306
Call me a bird all night.

16:53.374 --> 16:55.041
Making fun, saying names.

16:55.109 --> 16:58.678
Well, let's see who's
sexy now, dickwads.

16:58.746 --> 17:00.279
'Cause I look good.

17:00.347 --> 17:05.017
Dee was clearly on a warpath to prove
to one of you that she was indeed sexy.

17:05.085 --> 17:08.020
And the best way to do that was
to trick one of you two into

17:08.088 --> 17:10.189
making love to her.

17:10.257 --> 17:12.925
Knowing that Charlie was the
weakest and by the far the most

17:12.992 --> 17:16.496
vulnerable, she assumed he would be
the easiest to take advantage of.

17:16.563 --> 17:21.166
And so she took Charlie into the back
office and had her way with him.

17:23.604 --> 17:25.738
You should see the look on your face.

17:25.806 --> 17:27.573
It's good enough to eat.

17:27.641 --> 17:28.875
No. Hold on a second.

17:28.942 --> 17:30.109
That wasn't me.

17:30.177 --> 17:31.043
What?

17:31.111 --> 17:31.878
That wasn't me.

17:31.945 --> 17:32.812
I switched costumes with Dennis.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.547
That was Dennis.

17:34.615 --> 17:38.618
So Dennis thought Deandra
was the peacock chick?

17:38.685 --> 17:43.356
And Dee thought that
Dennis was Charlie?

17:49.830 --> 17:55.301
So Dee thinks that I'm the dad,
but, Dennis, you're the dad.

17:55.369 --> 17:58.070
Delightful.

17:58.138 --> 18:00.640
Oh, shit, I'm gonna be sick.

18:00.707 --> 18:01.841
Go, do it.

18:01.909 --> 18:04.444
Feel it. Let it out.

18:04.511 --> 18:06.546
Let's just get... let's
just get out of here.

18:07.414 --> 18:09.348
Don't flush.

18:10.972 --> 18:12.005
Dee!

18:12.073 --> 18:12.940
Deandra!

18:13.007 --> 18:13.807
Dee! Dee!

18:13.875 --> 18:14.889
Deandra!

18:15.009 --> 18:15.642
Yeah!

18:15.710 --> 18:16.509
This is bad.

18:16.577 --> 18:17.925
This is real bad.

18:18.045 --> 18:20.379
You thought you had sex with
Charlie, but it was Dennis

18:20.447 --> 18:22.315
that you went into the back room with.

18:22.382 --> 18:23.516
See?

18:23.584 --> 18:24.650
I had sex with you.

18:24.718 --> 18:26.519
It was sex with me,
it was sex with me.

18:26.587 --> 18:28.487
He threw up the whole
way over here, Dee.

18:28.555 --> 18:30.389
Dennis is the father of that baby.

18:30.457 --> 18:35.576
We got to get you and that monster
that's in your gut down to Mexico ASAP.

18:35.696 --> 18:36.596
Are you kidding me?

18:36.663 --> 18:38.397
I did not have sex with Dennis.

18:38.465 --> 18:39.565
Yes, you did.

18:39.633 --> 18:43.369
All right, look, look, you went
into the back office with him, not me.

18:43.437 --> 18:45.938
You thought it was me because
you wanted sex from me.

18:46.006 --> 18:47.807
But you got sex from Dennis.

18:47.875 --> 18:49.742
Okay, you're saying that
because I went into the back

18:49.810 --> 18:52.311
office alone with Dennis, that
I must have had sex with him?

18:52.379 --> 18:53.913
Gross.

18:53.981 --> 18:55.815
No, that did not happen.

18:55.883 --> 18:58.251
And you guys have been obsessing
about this all night long?

18:58.318 --> 18:59.385
Yes.

18:59.453 --> 19:00.186
Yeah?

19:00.254 --> 19:00.887
Of course.

19:00.954 --> 19:02.588
We were running around trying to
figure out who the father is.

19:02.656 --> 19:04.323
If it's not Dennis, who it is?

19:04.391 --> 19:05.725
It's none of you.

19:05.792 --> 19:06.559
Huh?

19:06.627 --> 19:08.261
No, none of you are the father.

19:08.328 --> 19:09.996
I just told you that because
you were making fun of me for

19:10.063 --> 19:11.831
eating the sandwich, and I
thought it would upset you and

19:11.899 --> 19:13.666
get you going and it did, it worked.

19:13.734 --> 19:15.902
You guys have been obsessing
about this all night.

19:15.969 --> 19:20.373
So, wait, are you absolutely
sure that you and I did not have

19:20.440 --> 19:22.575
sex, and that that's not my...?

19:22.643 --> 19:24.076
Uh, yeah.

19:26.046 --> 19:28.714
Oh!

19:28.815 --> 19:30.650
Whew!

19:30.717 --> 19:35.087
Yeah, but I'll tell you what, I'm not
going to tell you who the father is.

19:35.155 --> 19:36.589
Who gives a shit.

19:36.657 --> 19:38.591
You all give a shit, you just said so.

19:38.659 --> 19:39.525
You were up all night.

19:39.593 --> 19:41.127
You were... you were thinking
about it all night long.

19:41.194 --> 19:43.204
Yeah, but that was before,
when you said it was one of us.

19:43.245 --> 19:44.681
But if it's not one of us, I mean...

19:44.801 --> 19:45.757
Who cares?

19:45.877 --> 19:48.142
Who cares, right?
Yeah, we don't care.

19:55.751 --> 19:58.280
- This close...
- ...man, I really dodged the bullet on that.

20:00.314 --> 20:01.981
Hey, what about the museum?

20:02.049 --> 20:03.015
Yes.

20:03.083 --> 20:03.783
Boom.

20:03.850 --> 20:04.650
Yes, there's still time.

20:04.718 --> 20:05.751
Okay, Dee, we're out of here.

20:05.819 --> 20:06.953
You look like a turkey.

20:07.020 --> 20:10.423
Yeah. Also I would say, I would
say you look like an-an ostrich.

20:10.490 --> 20:10.990
Yes!

20:11.058 --> 20:11.624
Right?

20:11.692 --> 20:13.793
You know, I was... I want to
call her an emu, but I want to

20:13.860 --> 20:19.231
save it for, you know...
You are big, fat, flightless bird.

20:20.267 --> 20:25.004
Those are all... Those are all...
Just sort of a general... Whatever.
