has got everything I ever wanted.

00:08.715 --> 00:09.981

I hereby pledge my allegiance to you.

You're choosing him

- She knows the witches want her back.
- Her violin is missing.

She may have left
of her own volition.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.982
What did you say
to her in the attic?

08:20.984 --> 08:22.717
She lied to my face
so she could stay up there

help her control her magic.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.688
How do we know
that you didn't take her?

I have no idea where Davina is
or why she ran away.

Can I suggest you
take a step back?

08:37.033 --> 08:39.583
I can assure you, I have
absolutely no desire

08:39.586 --> 08:41.736
to see that child
come into harm's way.

08:41.738 --> 08:44.405
She's suffered enough with
this Harvest ritual nonsense.

08:44.407 --> 08:47.042
That child to whom you
refer so affectionately

If she's fled, what's
to stop her from destroying us,

08:52.556 --> 08:55.329
in fact, destroying all
we've worked for?

08:55.431 --> 09:00.229
No. If she's not a friend to this family,
then she is our enemy.

09:00.691 --> 09:05.067
- She is a friend, Klaus.
- Well, let's hope so.

Nicklaus operates.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.708

he can become quite ruthless.

09:19.710 --> 09:22.077
This would not bode
well for Davina.

09:22.079 --> 09:24.729
I'm not gonna let anybody
lay a finger on her.

09:25.433 --> 09:27.587
Nor will I.

is missing, huh?

09:38.090 --> 09:39.960
Walked right out the
front door, apparently.

09:39.961 --> 09:41.907
- Know anything about it?
- No...

09:42.545 --> 09:46.476
Although I did tell her that
the witch elders were dead.

09:46.560 --> 09:49.821
Well, why would she care when the witches
tried to kill her in their ritual?

09:49.823 --> 09:51.973
I think it was more that
Marcel didn't tell her

09:51.975 --> 09:55.540
that the one thing preventing her
from being free had been eliminated.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.814
So you are the reason
she's run off.

09:59.628 --> 10:04.115
Hey, I was just
telling her the truth.

10:04.548 --> 10:06.722
She's the one who realized
they were just using her

10:06.723 --> 10:08.656
to keep their control
over the witches.

10:08.658 --> 10:11.763
Yeah. Well, I've never been
a fan of the boys club.

10:12.829 --> 10:16.628
Just wait. Elijah will join them, and
the three of them will be impossible.

10:18.577 --> 10:22.024
Used by the witches,
lied to by Marcel,

10:22.025 --> 10:25.190

threatened by Klaus...

10:25.192 --> 10:27.642
She's like a modern-day

10:28.740 --> 10:32.084
Are you talking about
Davina or yourself?

10:32.840 --> 10:34.774
Does it matter?

have taken the hint.

11:13.989 --> 11:16.691
You've been acting like this
since Agnes was killed.

11:16.693 --> 11:18.526
Yeah.
Can you blame me?

11:18.528 --> 11:21.562
It's not like I have a lot
to keep me going these days.

11:21.564 --> 11:24.115
Well, while you've been
drowning your sorrows

11:24.117 --> 11:26.401
by nailing everything

11:27.009 --> 11:31.373

my head down and my ears open.

Marcel's daywalkers
are scouring the whole town

11:34.211 --> 11:38.310

brown hair, blue eyes.

11:38.311 --> 11:40.068
Sound familiar?

11:41.802 --> 11:45.904
If Davina is not with Marcel, he won't
know if we're practicing magic,

11:45.906 --> 11:50.892
and if we can actually get her back,
we can fix everything.

11:50.894 --> 11:55.621

practicing magic.

12:35.988 --> 12:38.425
They're trying
to find me.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.077
Then we have to run.

12:49.381 --> 12:51.729
Davina: There is no way
to sneak me out of the quarter.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.314
By now, everyone
is looking for me...

12:53.322 --> 12:56.566
- The witches, Marcel, Klaus.
- My uncle will know what to do.

12:56.577 --> 12:57.648
Cami...

12:57.649 --> 12:59.462
I mean, he has to know somewhat
of what's going on in this town, right...

12:59.463 --> 13:01.089
- Cami, stop.
- Unless he's been compelled.

13:01.090 --> 13:03.395
- He knows.
- What are you talking about?

13:03.396 --> 13:05.045
He knows.

13:06.843 --> 13:09.905
He works with Marcel.
They're practically friends.

13:09.907 --> 13:13.241
I hear them talk.
He knows everything.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.129
No.

13:20.266 --> 13:23.249
He would've told me if he knew
the witches put a hex on my brother.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.171
He knows?

- Cami...
- Oh, my God.

He knows.

need to go, like now...

13:53.616 --> 13:55.834

automobile, whatever.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.705
Take my car. It's parked down
at the docks, I'll text you the where.

13:58.706 --> 14:00.220
Put your number
in Cami's phone.

14:00.221 --> 14:02.917
Most of the quarter is shut down
right now, we'll have to walk,

14:03.011 --> 14:05.044
And the sun is taking
forever to go down.

14:06.707 --> 14:09.407
Hey, no tears.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.974
Promise you'll meet us
as soon as it gets dark out.

14:15.975 --> 14:19.058
Yeah, but don't worry about me.
Just don't let them find you.

14:21.077 --> 14:23.445
I know Klaus told
you to follow me,

14:23.447 --> 14:26.370
but does it really mean you have
to follow me to the bathroom?

14:42.966 --> 14:46.360
- What the hell do you want?
- I know you don't trust me...

14:46.361 --> 14:50.227
- But you need to listen.
- Everything is about to change.

14:50.252 --> 14:53.565
- Davina is on the loose.
- Figured that out on your own, huh?

14:53.626 --> 14:56.228
Remind me again why
I should give a damn.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.312
I need something
from you,

14:58.313 --> 15:00.711
so that the witches
can complete the Harvest.

15:00.712 --> 15:04.380
On what planet would I help
you witches get more power?

15:04.381 --> 15:06.464
All you've done is
hex me left and right.

15:06.465 --> 15:09.466
You'll help me because
if we don't complete the Harvest,

15:09.511 --> 15:12.279
our access to magic
will fade for good,

15:12.429 --> 15:14.462
which doesn't bode well
for your family.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.067
What do you know
about my family?

15:19.769 --> 15:22.018
You're from the
Crescent Wolf bloodline.

15:22.019 --> 15:25.152
Marcel forced a witch to curse them
so they'd be trapped in wolf form.

15:25.153 --> 15:28.593
And I should keep listening
to you because...

15:28.594 --> 15:32.276
Because my bloodline
executed that curse.

15:32.926 --> 15:38.042
Help me complete the Harvest,
and I'll undo the curse for you.

15:38.859 --> 15:41.226
But what can I do?

15:41.775 --> 15:43.892
I need to consecrate
the remains

15:43.894 --> 15:47.136
of a powerful witch
so I can absorb their magic.

15:47.137 --> 15:49.249
I know of one whose
body was never found.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.617
Her name is Celeste Dubois.

15:52.478 --> 15:55.512
I believe you and she
have a friend in common.

15:55.515 --> 15:56.666
Elijah.

15:56.667 --> 16:01.752
Story goes that when she died, he buried
her in a secret spot at her request.

16:02.746 --> 16:05.376
All you need to do
is find out where.

16:07.909 --> 16:09.727
[Beep]
Oh...

everywhere.

No one knows it's you.

16:28.214 --> 16:30.204
Cami...

16:36.120 --> 16:38.642
We have to get
off this street.

16:49.967 --> 16:53.404
Kieran is gonna call me first
if he hears anything.

16:53.406 --> 16:55.856
Ah, you two look
rather cozy.

16:55.858 --> 16:58.942
Hardly. I was just telling Elijah
how we're wasting time.

16:58.944 --> 17:02.746
- You don't like festivals?
- Rebekah: I don't see why not?

17:02.748 --> 17:04.843
Who doesn't love
a street fair?

17:04.844 --> 17:07.867
Sister, come to help us
find our stray?

17:07.869 --> 17:11.488
We can't let your secret weapon
get in the wrong hands, can we?

17:11.490 --> 17:15.041
For the record, we are moments
away from retrieving her.

17:15.044 --> 17:17.761
Elijah: I recognize that
tone of voice, Nicklaus.

17:17.762 --> 17:21.665
Clearly, you have some diabolical
machination. What is it?

17:27.137 --> 17:29.339
Timothy...

17:29.708 --> 17:32.059
Might I have a word?

17:33.194 --> 17:38.133
Cami, hey, it's me...
Again... Stalking you.

17:38.134 --> 17:39.900
Look. Just really
need to know where you guys are

17:39.901 --> 17:42.202
so I can meet you
before the sun comes up... Again.

17:42.204 --> 17:45.823
[Beeping]

17:46.749 --> 17:48.205
Uh, hello?

17:48.206 --> 17:50.790
Joshua, my most
disappointing Minion,

17:50.792 --> 17:53.776
I suspected you wouldn't answer
the call were it from me.

17:53.778 --> 17:56.779
Klaus, hey, what up?

17:56.781 --> 17:59.298
Guess what.
I just moved to Turkey.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.084
Weirdly, they don't
eat turkey here.

18:01.086 --> 18:03.034
- Go figure.
- You're lying.

18:03.035 --> 18:06.672
In fact, Marcel and I were just chatting
about your failed double agent status,

18:06.674 --> 18:08.457
and we've surmised that
you're likely still in town

18:08.459 --> 18:10.426
and in the company
of a friend...

18:10.428 --> 18:14.731
- A young, angry witch.
- Nope. Nope. No witches here.

18:14.733 --> 18:16.099
Totally digging
Turkey, though.

18:16.101 --> 18:20.923
Are you really gonna leave Davinaâ€™s
fiddler soul mate Timothy alone with me?

18:21.579 --> 18:26.025
Oh, Josh, what would
she think of that?

18:26.027 --> 18:29.843
I assure you, I just
wanna talk to her.

18:29.961 --> 18:31.994
Tim and I will be
at the compound.

18:32.254 --> 18:35.472
I really do hope she
comes home soon.

18:50.370 --> 18:53.152
We should keep moving.
How long do we have to wait?

18:53.154 --> 18:56.301
Give it a few minutes. Then I'll check
to see if the coast is clear.

Josh, sorry I missed
your calls.

19:06.299 --> 19:07.603
What?

19:07.604 --> 19:09.820
I didn't want to tell you,
but I know Klaus.

19:09.821 --> 19:12.638
If Davina doesn't show up,
he'll kill Tim.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.457
We'll think
of something.

19:14.749 --> 19:16.632
Make your way to the
quarter. Stay hidden.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.377
We'll text you when
we have a plan.

19:18.379 --> 19:19.260
[Beep]

19:19.261 --> 19:20.580
- I have to go.
- Davina, wait.

19:20.582 --> 19:22.337
I can't let Tim die.

19:23.610 --> 19:25.541

Hey. It's just me.
Don't, like, melt me.

21:40.079 --> 21:41.788
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be hidden.

21:41.789 --> 21:44.433
Yeah. So are you, remember?
But you're kind of working that whole

21:44.434 --> 21:46.738
"girl on a mission" look
that makes me nervous.

21:47.070 --> 21:49.502
Are you sure that you
really want to mess with, like...

21:49.503 --> 21:53.606
- The baddest dude in all of history?
- He messed with me when he took Tim.

21:54.149 --> 21:58.612
- I'll kill him, all of them.
- Davina, Originals can't be killed.

21:58.613 --> 22:00.270
Maybe they can.

22:00.434 --> 22:04.417
I have so much power, I've never
felt anything like it before.

gathering inside me.

22:24.196 --> 22:26.301
Don't hold back.

You hit them
with all you got.

That was very sweet,

22:38.438 --> 22:42.973
not telling Davina that if she kills
Klaus, you die, too, very noble.

22:43.405 --> 22:47.674
Problem is, she goes after my brother,
she'll be the one who ends up dead.

22:47.835 --> 22:52.440
A very unnecessary end
to an already-tragic story.

to help me help her.

I'm concerned about,

that Davina will come?

forgotten what it's like

to be in the grip of an
all-consuming infatuation.

absolutely necessary, Nicklaus?

was my idea. Apologies.

feed it to a nightwalker,

29:41.951 --> 29:43.667
Marcel learned
from the best.

29:43.669 --> 29:47.221
This is how he treats his
so-called friends who betray him.

29:47.223 --> 29:50.925
Most of what these poor souls did
is no worse than what Josh did.

29:50.927 --> 29:53.193
Take Thierry,
for example.

29:53.195 --> 29:55.846
He was Marcelâ€™s
most trusted friend.

29:56.982 --> 29:59.767
Klaus tricked him into breaking
one of Marcelâ€™s rules.

29:59.769 --> 30:02.869
Marcel knows this,
and yet he keeps Thierry

30:02.870 --> 30:06.640
locked in here day
after day suffering.

30:06.642 --> 30:08.216
This is insane.

30:09.795 --> 30:11.795
Why are you
telling me this?

30:11.797 --> 30:14.198
Because you need to know
who you're dealing with,

30:14.762 --> 30:16.331
who you can trust.

30:20.259 --> 30:23.540
Timothy: Hey, hey,
it's gonna be ok.

30:23.542 --> 30:27.294
I mean, you're
gonna be all right.

30:27.813 --> 30:31.540
Here.
Drink something.

30:32.518 --> 30:35.519
Davina, both you and I
have been lied to

30:35.521 --> 30:38.439
and taken advantage of
by Marcel and Klaus.

30:38.441 --> 30:41.164
Maybe together, we can
get a little payback.

30:42.194 --> 30:44.828
[Coughing]

30:46.999 --> 30:48.332
Tim?

30:48.334 --> 30:51.735
[Coughing continues]

30:51.737 --> 30:55.255
It was Klaus.
He made me do it.

30:55.257 --> 30:58.608
I didn't even know what
I was doing until I made you...

30:59.095 --> 31:01.007
Made her what?

31:04.175 --> 31:05.577
Drink.

31:09.445 --> 31:11.739
Klaus poisoned the water.

31:11.788 --> 31:13.622
Tim?

31:15.930 --> 31:17.132
Davina...

31:17.158 --> 31:18.511
[Whimpers]

31:18.536 --> 31:19.770
Oh, no...

31:32.500 --> 31:34.450
Cami, are you
all right?

31:34.679 --> 31:37.179
Did you eat today?

31:37.478 --> 31:39.917
Oh, you must
have fainted.

31:41.517 --> 31:45.321
Yeah, or I got mystically
coldcocked by four witches.

31:45.323 --> 31:48.799
Where's Davina? Does your
friend Marcel know she's here?

31:48.837 --> 31:53.406
- Cami, I can explain.
- Vampires? Witches?

31:53.408 --> 31:57.414
My brother, your nephew,
hexed by a witch.

31:57.508 --> 32:02.113
- How could you not tell me?
- It's complicated.

32:02.918 --> 32:06.470
- There's a lot you don't understand.
- You hid the truth from me.

32:06.472 --> 32:08.855
You let me believe
that Sean was crazy,

32:08.857 --> 32:12.375
that I was crazy, instead
of telling me the truth.

32:12.377 --> 32:14.831
I was protecting you.

32:17.599 --> 32:20.367
You saw what
happened to Sean.

32:20.369 --> 32:22.769
- Cami, please...
- Get the hell away from me.

32:22.771 --> 32:26.654
You are every bit as bad as
the other monsters in this city.

32:28.125 --> 32:29.776
[Door latch clanks]

32:35.199 --> 32:38.490
Oh, isn't this
monumentally awkward.

32:40.861 --> 32:42.662
Rebekah,
where are you?

32:42.663 --> 32:46.059
I'm with Davina, and she's dying
because of your treachery.

32:46.061 --> 32:48.562
Well, I tried to talk to her,
out of respect for Marcel,

32:48.564 --> 32:51.031
but she made it quite clear
she is not our friend.

32:51.033 --> 32:52.899
My apologies is you
thought she was yours.

32:52.901 --> 32:54.768
Just tell me
how to cure her.

32:54.770 --> 32:58.238
- Vampire blood isn't working.
- No. It wouldn't.

32:58.240 --> 33:02.950
You see, the poison I compelled
Timothy to feed her is quite potent.

33:03.035 --> 33:05.045
It's just a matter
of time for her.

33:05.047 --> 33:08.235
For both of them,
you diabolical bastard.

33:08.236 --> 33:09.868
They're children.

33:10.151 --> 33:11.868
We could've dealt
with her fairly.

33:11.870 --> 33:14.504
There is no dealing with
those who threaten us.

33:14.506 --> 33:17.575
Davina sealed her fate
when she stood against me.

33:17.576 --> 33:20.027
This was her choice,
not mine.

33:20.329 --> 33:23.680
[Panting]

33:30.304 --> 33:32.338
Oh, come on.

33:32.340 --> 33:35.559
The stench of your judgment
is overwhelming.

33:35.561 --> 33:38.979
Need I remind you that Davina
just bested the lot of us?

33:38.981 --> 33:41.629
I did what had to be done.

33:42.451 --> 33:47.287
Don't worry, Elijah.
I remain as redeemable as ever.

33:47.289 --> 33:48.738
So you compelled that
boy to poison Davina

33:48.740 --> 33:51.024
without consulting
Marcel or myself.

33:51.584 --> 33:53.874
You know what
the worst part is?

33:53.875 --> 33:57.582
Is that you're so predictable, I had
to make an alliance with your brother,

33:57.583 --> 33:59.807
who I don't even like.

34:04.204 --> 34:07.557
Judging by your expression,
you have something you'd like to share.

34:07.559 --> 34:09.609
Damn straight, I do.

34:09.610 --> 34:12.012
I got a call
from Kieran earlier,

34:12.014 --> 34:15.577
right after Sabine and some witches
almost got their hands on Davina first.

34:16.351 --> 34:17.717
[Gasps]

34:17.719 --> 34:20.186
Oh, hello.

34:21.822 --> 34:24.424
Let me guess,
protection spell?

34:25.501 --> 34:29.873
You think I'd let a day where witches
can do magic pass by without one?

34:31.083 --> 34:34.509
- They all should've done the same.
- Yeah.

34:36.704 --> 34:39.020
You broke one of
my rules, Sabine,

34:39.043 --> 34:42.514
and I'm guessing that spell of yours
is probably a one-time deal.

34:43.732 --> 34:45.715
I'll give you
two choices...

34:45.819 --> 34:49.289
An immediate reunion with
your dearly departed friends

34:49.478 --> 34:52.697
or you can do that same spell
for a young witch friend of mine.

34:54.431 --> 34:57.613
Yeah. You probably know
which one I'm talking about.

35:01.529 --> 35:03.930
So when you slipped away
to allegedly check

35:03.932 --> 35:08.507
on your nightwalkers, you were,
in fact, colluding with a witch.

35:08.811 --> 35:12.746
Very clever. I suppose
I should be proud.

35:12.747 --> 35:16.962
Eh, I just wanted to make sure
I had a failsafe just in case,

35:16.977 --> 35:19.727
as Elijah expected,
you started acting like you.

35:19.831 --> 35:21.414
Except that now you've
involved the witches,

35:21.416 --> 35:22.732
who, last time
I checked,

35:22.734 --> 35:25.418
were enemy to us all,
to everything we have,

35:25.420 --> 35:27.487
and to our family.

35:27.489 --> 35:29.089
Davina is Marcelâ€™s
family, Nicklaus,

35:29.091 --> 35:32.563
or did that somehow slip your mind
as you tried to take her life?

35:35.706 --> 35:39.599
You will call Rebekah. You'll tell her
that Davina will recover.

35:42.192 --> 35:44.461
Do wish the same could
be said for that boy.

35:55.282 --> 35:57.667
[Gasps]

35:57.669 --> 36:00.353
Huh. Oh...

36:06.177 --> 36:08.115
Tim.

36:08.267 --> 36:11.235
Tim? Tim?

36:11.236 --> 36:14.969
Tim, Tim, wake up.
Tim, please wake up.

36:14.970 --> 36:19.439
Open your eyes.
No, no.

36:20.159 --> 36:23.159
Please wake up.

36:24.235 --> 36:27.557
Please don't
leave me alone.

36:50.152 --> 36:51.864
Is she ok?

36:53.178 --> 36:56.836
She's devastated
and exhausted.

36:59.020 --> 37:01.822
- Where's her room?
- No. I got her.

37:04.370 --> 37:05.774
I got her.

37:36.652 --> 37:41.912
Rebekah, voice-over: <i>It is said that this
is a man's world, and sometimes it is.</i>

37:50.050 --> 37:54.812
<i>For every casket girl that was saved,
countless others were not...</i>

37:54.813 --> 37:58.028
- She'll never trust me again.
- Perhaps.

37:59.074 --> 38:02.058
You must never surrender
the fight to reclaim that trust.

38:02.383 --> 38:06.302
Rebekah, voice-over: <i>But women are more
resilient than given credit for...</i>

38:06.813 --> 38:10.514
These drawings,
what are they?

38:10.759 --> 38:14.095
She drew those the whole
time she was in the attic,

38:14.205 --> 38:17.558
said they're different than what
she draws when she senses magic.

38:19.877 --> 38:22.608
These ones, she
called them evil.

38:24.987 --> 38:28.111
Rebekah, voice-over:
<i>And some women, well,</i>

38:29.142 --> 38:32.297
<i>let's just say, their oppressors
had better watch out.</i>

38:42.924 --> 38:46.643
Surprised to see me? After all,
you did compel me to leave town.

38:47.405 --> 38:50.973
- You remember.
- Chalk one up for decompulsion.

38:50.974 --> 38:52.584
Hurts like hell,
but it's worth it,

38:52.585 --> 38:55.435
made me realize exactly
why I want to stick around.

38:55.437 --> 38:58.704
Oh, and, Klaus,
if you hurt Davina

38:58.705 --> 39:02.075
or Josh in any way,
I'll expose you to the world,

39:02.076 --> 39:04.254
and then you can kiss
the French Quarter good-bye.

39:04.255 --> 39:06.041
Forever.

39:06.476 --> 39:08.143
Have a nice night.

39:10.599 --> 39:16.009
Rebekah, voice-over: I, too, am resilient,
and I'm tired of being oppressed.

39:16.214 --> 39:18.748
For 1,000 years, my brother
has taken what he wants

39:18.749 --> 39:21.917
in whatever way he wants,
regardless of the consequences.

39:22.131 --> 39:24.798
Marcel seems determined
to allow it,

39:24.800 --> 39:26.800
and Elijah stands
right by his side

39:26.802 --> 39:29.353
futilely awaiting
the day that he'll change.

39:29.355 --> 39:31.504
[Gulp]

39:31.506 --> 39:33.440
[Music playing]

39:33.442 --> 39:35.442
Ahh...

39:35.444 --> 39:37.940
So men suck.

39:38.170 --> 39:40.637
What do you want me
to do about it?

39:40.749 --> 39:45.118
Despite your dire warnings to Marcel,
he just can't seem to quit my brother.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.870
The two of them
stand side by side

39:46.872 --> 39:50.056
ruling this city whilst
you're left in here to rot.

39:51.815 --> 39:56.897
I want you to help me take New Orleans
right out from under all of their noses,

39:56.899 --> 40:00.500
and I have something
they won't see coming,

40:00.502 --> 40:03.026
someone
on the inside.

40:03.357 --> 40:06.492
She's quite
the resilient girl herself.

40:30.031 --> 40:32.018
You OK?

40:32.801 --> 40:34.894
I'm better now.

40:36.588 --> 40:38.560
How was your day?

40:39.215 --> 40:40.831
Killer.

40:44.430 --> 40:48.780
- What's with the artwork?
- Davina's sketches.

40:49.146 --> 40:53.420
I wonder if they represent
some kind of premonition.

40:54.740 --> 40:56.036
Okay...

40:56.775 --> 40:59.697
They seem to suggest
something is coming...

41:03.247 --> 41:06.566
Something sinister.

41:21.405 --> 41:23.500
Oh, my God...

41:23.931 --> 41:25.581
Isn't that...

41:29.807 --> 41:31.975
Hello, Celeste.

41:51.212 --> 41:54.665
Come on, Sophie. Pick up.
Pick up.
