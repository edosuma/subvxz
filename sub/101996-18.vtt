39:51.867 --> 39:54.653
NOT A PROBLEM.

39:54.696 --> 39:57.873
DAMN. SECURITY'S
WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.

39:57.917 --> 40:00.441
I ONLY GAVE HIM
40 BUCKS.

40:00.485 --> 40:03.139
WELL, HERE YOU HAVE IT--

40:03.183 --> 40:05.272
ALICE BEHIND BARS,

40:05.315 --> 40:09.450
THE JUMPSUIT,
EMBARRASSING LACK
OF SHOELACES,

40:09.494 --> 40:13.019
A NEIGHBOR WHO'S
CRAZIER THAN ME.

40:13.062 --> 40:16.283
IS IT EVERYTHING
YOU'D HOPED FOR?

40:16.326 --> 40:18.590
I JUST WANTED
THE SYSTEM TO
WORK FOR ONCE.

40:18.633 --> 40:21.027
RIGHT.

40:21.070 --> 40:26.511
IT FINALLY DID.
THIS IS JUSTICE
FOR MY MOM.

40:26.554 --> 40:29.296
JUST HAPPY
I GOT TO SEE IT
WITH MY OWN EYES.

40:31.777 --> 40:35.433
I HOPE WE NEVER SEE
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

40:38.697 --> 40:42.962
FUNNY YOU SHOULD
MENTION MOTHERS ACTUALLY.

40:45.312 --> 40:49.882
YOU REMIND ME ALMOST
DAILY THAT YOUR ADOPTIVE
MOTHER IS DEAD,

40:49.925 --> 40:54.147
BUT MAYBE THERE'S
A LITTLE WIGGLE ROOM
FOR BIO MOM.

40:54.190 --> 40:55.540
WHAT?

40:55.583 --> 40:58.934
OH. YOU DON'T KNOW.

40:58.978 --> 41:03.330
HMM. WELL, MAYBE IT'S TIME
SOMEONE TOLD YOU.

41:03.373 --> 41:06.072
YOUR MOTHER DIDN'T DIE
IN CHILDBIRTH, RY-RY.

41:09.031 --> 41:13.122
MOMMY DEAREST IS STILL
VERY MUCH ALIVE.

42:10.963 --> 42:12.834
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
