WEBVTT

00:00.027 --> 00:04.197
My name is Roman. Ten years ago,
our ship crash-landed on earth.

00:04.574 --> 00:07.371
We came here seeking refuge,
but the humans thought

00:07.373 --> 00:08.356
that it was an invasion.

00:10.925 --> 00:13.922
That night I met a human
girl who tried to protect me.

00:14.042 --> 00:16.155
A girl I never thought I'd see again.

00:16.628 --> 00:18.098
The surviving members of my race,

00:18.106 --> 00:19.813
the Atrians, were rounded up

00:19.815 --> 00:22.412
and isolated inside a militarized sector.

00:22.532 --> 00:24.029
Now, it's 2024.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.330
Seven of us have been
chosen to attend high school

00:26.350 --> 00:28.104
as a part of a government
integration program.

00:28.106 --> 00:29.572
But the humans and Atrians

00:29.574 --> 00:31.574
continue to distrust each other

00:31.576 --> 00:34.127
while I fight to protect my people

00:34.129 --> 00:36.062
and the human girl who saved my life

00:36.064 --> 00:38.548
at any cost.

00:38.550 --> 00:40.116
Previously on Star-Crossed...

00:40.118 --> 00:42.696
Roman, it was an accident!
I am so sorry!

00:42.717 --> 00:45.171
Why? Because my father's dead or
because your father shot him?

00:45.173 --> 00:47.290
I found this in Julia's hospital room.

00:47.292 --> 00:48.994
You saved her life.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.431
It didn't happen.

00:50.432 --> 00:51.978
Hey, what happened to your...

00:51.980 --> 00:54.027
Arm?

00:54.037 --> 00:55.852
They want revenge for my father's death.

00:55.853 --> 00:57.129
They've targeted your family.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.152
We keep with our own kind.

00:59.154 --> 01:00.518
One of us is always watching.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.478
This is bigger than the two of us now.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.840
It's safer if we're apart.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.353 --> 01:22.759
I've been looking for you.

01:22.761 --> 01:24.881
Teri, I'm not in the mood.

01:24.882 --> 01:26.690
Give me a minute.

01:26.711 --> 01:28.715
You will be.

02:31.529 --> 02:32.453
Rough night?

02:32.474 --> 02:34.370
Stay out of my head.

02:34.377 --> 02:35.466
You used to beg me

02:35.479 --> 02:36.209
to use kyter leaves

02:36.210 --> 02:37.545
and give you those dreams.

02:37.551 --> 02:38.912
That was a long time ago.

02:38.913 --> 02:40.550
I'd slip a leaf under your pillow

02:40.563 --> 02:41.731
and whisper in your ear

02:41.732 --> 02:43.140
all the dirty things we used to do.

02:43.153 --> 02:45.833
Teri, we used to be a lot of things.

02:45.835 --> 02:48.649
But if you want us to stay
friends, this has to stop.

02:53.852 --> 02:55.140
I can't believe it.

02:55.148 --> 02:57.186
I'm here.

02:57.188 --> 02:59.589
I'm finally in high school.

02:59.591 --> 03:01.533
I wanted your first day to be special.

03:01.541 --> 03:04.260
Bedazzled locker, dancing bears on parade.

03:04.262 --> 03:06.563
But with arrival day coming,

03:06.564 --> 03:10.149
I thought it might be in bad taste.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.743
After the carnival,

03:23.752 --> 03:24.830
he won't even look at me.

03:24.831 --> 03:26.132
What did you do?

03:26.134 --> 03:27.632
Nothing I can't think of.

03:28.587 --> 03:30.044
You've been in school a week,

03:30.053 --> 03:32.422
and you already have boy problems?

03:32.424 --> 03:34.757
High school is phenomenal.

03:34.759 --> 03:36.642
The tenth anniversary

03:36.643 --> 03:38.466
of arrival day is in two days.

03:39.183 --> 03:40.213
Families of the fallen,

03:40.221 --> 03:42.191
as well as human and
Atrian students who are part

03:42.196 --> 03:45.293
of this integration program,
are all invited to attend

03:45.294 --> 03:47.136
the commemoration, which will be held

03:47.138 --> 03:49.639
at the base of the Atrian ship.

03:49.641 --> 03:51.475
Awesome. Like, no one's been allowed

03:51.483 --> 03:52.648
near the ship since it crashed.

03:52.656 --> 03:53.660
I've been on that ship.

03:53.669 --> 03:54.774
You're not missing anything.

03:54.791 --> 03:57.207
The eyes of the world will be on us.

03:57.215 --> 03:59.148
People want to see how this exchange

03:59.150 --> 04:01.062
of cultures is progressing.

04:01.063 --> 04:03.603
So far, the Atrian seven have attended

04:03.608 --> 04:06.215
human school and human events.

04:06.232 --> 04:09.258
The next step is to introduce humans

04:09.260 --> 04:11.160
into Atrian society.

04:11.162 --> 04:13.272
To that end, the human students

04:13.278 --> 04:15.456
in this room have been selected

04:15.457 --> 04:17.803
to spend a day in the sector tomorrow.

04:17.820 --> 04:20.836
We've never had human
guests in the sector before.

04:20.838 --> 04:23.288
We thought the rat infestation was bad.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.358
It's the first time
human students will have

04:25.360 --> 04:27.087
access to the sector.

04:27.088 --> 04:28.763
You'll be making history.

04:36.687 --> 04:38.071
Uh, Ms. Garcia?

04:38.073 --> 04:40.279
I had an idea about the
sector visit tomorrow.

04:40.287 --> 04:41.098
Yes?

04:41.106 --> 04:43.123
We've all heard arrival
day stories from our side...

04:43.132 --> 04:44.465
The humans...

04:44.473 --> 04:46.026
But we haven't heard what it was like

04:46.035 --> 04:48.531
- from the Atrians.
- Go on.

04:48.533 --> 04:50.971
I thought we could use
our sector visit tomorrow

04:50.972 --> 04:53.720
to ask the Atrians for
their arrival stories.

04:53.722 --> 04:56.205
Emery shouldn't come to the sector.

04:57.374 --> 04:58.874
There are a lot of Atrians

04:58.876 --> 05:00.042
that are still angry

05:00.044 --> 05:01.978
about my father getting shot by...

05:01.980 --> 05:03.730
It's just...

05:04.833 --> 05:06.716
Sh... she could be at risk.

05:06.718 --> 05:08.488
Well, we've dealt with the terrorists.

05:08.497 --> 05:09.745
And there's ample security.

05:09.754 --> 05:11.721
So unless you know

05:11.723 --> 05:13.606
of a specific threat?

05:15.598 --> 05:17.560
Well, then I see no reason for concern.

05:17.562 --> 05:18.995
Emery's project would show

05:18.997 --> 05:20.596
that both sides are eager to move on.

05:20.598 --> 05:22.865
Congratulations, Ms. Whitehill.

05:22.867 --> 05:24.083
The assignment is yours.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.514
Looking real pretty, sweetheart.

05:38.516 --> 05:40.383
That's really insensitive!

05:40.385 --> 05:43.503
Even for a 'roided-up
alien. These ribbons are

05:43.505 --> 05:46.305
a remembrance of those who
lost their lives on arrival day.

05:46.307 --> 05:48.672
The day your kind
literally crashed our town.

05:48.673 --> 05:50.243
Yeah, I know. I was there.

05:50.260 --> 05:54.430
Did you know Grayson's brother
was killed by an Atrian?

05:56.106 --> 05:57.380
You lost a brother?

05:57.389 --> 06:00.953
Yeah, he was in the national guard.

06:00.955 --> 06:03.072
I lost half of my tribe.

06:03.074 --> 06:04.373
Those who survived the crash

06:04.375 --> 06:05.775
were gunned down by your bitch guards.

06:05.777 --> 06:07.543
But you don't see me

06:07.545 --> 06:10.263
wrapping myself in ribbon like
a birthday present, now do you?

06:10.265 --> 06:13.549
I'm sorry for your loss.

06:13.551 --> 06:15.618
But my brother wasn't a bitch.

06:15.620 --> 06:17.470
Let's keep it moving.

06:21.308 --> 06:23.176
Right. Yeah.

06:26.930 --> 06:28.640
Julia.

06:30.234 --> 06:32.518
What is that? A camera.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.803
From Gloria.

06:33.805 --> 06:35.438
I volunteered to interview the Atrians

06:35.440 --> 06:36.939
- while we're in the sector.
- That's amazing.

06:36.941 --> 06:38.441
Cameras are never allowed in the sector.

06:38.443 --> 06:40.159
And she's letting you shoot there?

06:40.161 --> 06:41.828
You can barely work a can opener.

06:41.830 --> 06:44.447
Why are you really doing this?

06:44.449 --> 06:46.332
Is it even safe for you to be there?

06:46.334 --> 06:47.483
Gloria said we're gonna

06:47.485 --> 06:48.501
have guards watching us

06:48.503 --> 06:50.464
the whole time, and...

06:50.481 --> 06:52.488
This program was Roman's father's dream.

06:52.490 --> 06:55.424
And by helping, I think that...

06:55.426 --> 06:57.033
Okay, I've been in a hospital half my life

06:57.041 --> 06:58.928
and even I know the way
to a boy's heart is not

06:58.930 --> 07:00.788
through his dead father's passion project.

07:01.058 --> 07:02.569
Are you gonna help me or not?

07:02.585 --> 07:03.858
You have a free period,

07:03.866 --> 07:06.886
and you could help with the camera.

07:06.888 --> 07:08.855
Actually, I have to go
see the school counselor.

07:08.857 --> 07:11.173
But maybe later?

07:16.647 --> 07:18.614
You know, if you're
looking for a cameraman,

07:18.616 --> 07:21.450
I actually know this
great indie film director

07:21.452 --> 07:23.870
who just thinks that
shooting the sector would be

07:23.872 --> 07:25.655
amazing.

07:25.657 --> 07:26.550
You do?

07:26.558 --> 07:28.491
And he'll work for peanuts.

07:28.493 --> 07:31.694
So do I got the job?

07:39.035 --> 07:40.942
We need to talk.

07:42.520 --> 07:43.789
This isn't a good time.

07:43.791 --> 07:45.258
What's with the 'tude?

07:45.260 --> 07:47.343
You were plenty friendly
when Emery and I snuck

07:47.345 --> 07:48.821
into the sector for cyper.

07:48.822 --> 07:51.480
- I really don't remember.
- Then I'll remind you.

07:51.482 --> 07:54.454
I was looking for a miracle
cure for my cancer, as you do

07:54.463 --> 07:57.069
But you said cyper was just a cooking herb.

07:57.071 --> 07:58.855
Funny thing...

07:58.857 --> 08:01.186
The next day I was completely cured.

08:01.195 --> 08:03.507
One minute I was all
comatose and leukemia-y.

08:03.515 --> 08:06.028
The next, I was sitting
up and eating nachos.

08:06.030 --> 08:07.563
I'm glad you're better.

08:07.565 --> 08:09.122
But what does this have to do with me?

08:09.123 --> 08:11.267
I think it has everything to do with you.

08:11.269 --> 08:13.419
You and cyper.

08:13.421 --> 08:16.127
You sure those nachos weren't laced

08:16.135 --> 08:18.073
with a little something extra?

08:18.075 --> 08:20.676
Fine.

08:20.678 --> 08:23.262
I'll just go and share my insane suspicions

08:23.264 --> 08:24.319
with my doctors.

08:24.327 --> 08:27.934
I'm sure they'll be very intrigued.

08:31.605 --> 08:33.039
I knew it!

08:33.048 --> 08:34.811
You saved me using cyper, didn't you?

08:34.818 --> 08:37.058
Whatever you think happened,

08:37.061 --> 08:38.423
you need to keep it to yourself.

08:38.424 --> 08:40.029
If cyper can cure cancer,

08:40.030 --> 08:42.114
don't you want the world to know?

08:45.569 --> 08:47.603
Okay.

08:47.605 --> 08:50.573
You're right, I did save you.

08:50.575 --> 08:52.208
I infused cyper

08:52.210 --> 08:53.459
into my bloodstream

08:53.461 --> 08:55.378
and then injected my blood into you.

08:55.380 --> 08:56.946
But if the world found out about this,

08:56.948 --> 08:59.081
every human with a sick
child, friend or pet

08:59.083 --> 09:00.416
will be tearing apart the sector,

09:00.418 --> 09:03.002
looking for cyper and Atrian blood.

09:03.004 --> 09:04.971
And if my people found out that I put them

09:04.973 --> 09:06.889
at risk to save a nice,

09:06.891 --> 09:09.992
but very chatty human being,
there will be consequences.

09:09.994 --> 09:12.428
Bad ones for both of us.

09:12.430 --> 09:14.279
So I'm asking you please

09:14.287 --> 09:16.148
can you keep this a secret?

09:16.150 --> 09:18.267
That might be a problem.

09:18.269 --> 09:20.186
Why?

09:24.408 --> 09:26.192
What are you doing?

09:33.450 --> 09:36.619
It started when I touched
you at the carnival.

09:36.621 --> 09:39.321
And it's been spreading ever since.

09:39.323 --> 09:41.223
If you want to keep cyper a secret,

09:41.225 --> 09:43.927
you're gonna have to fix this.

09:56.848 --> 09:59.800
Are you ready for our human guests?

09:59.802 --> 10:01.752
Do we have a choice?

10:01.754 --> 10:04.939
Your father would have given
anything to see this day.

10:04.941 --> 10:06.774
I thought you'd be more enthusiastic.

10:06.776 --> 10:08.142
Excited.

10:08.144 --> 10:11.248
Emery Whitehill is coming.

10:11.931 --> 10:13.781
Remember, you gave me your word

10:13.783 --> 10:15.699
that you would keep
her safe from the Trags.

10:15.701 --> 10:18.402
Her father did shoot and
kill our beloved leader.

10:18.404 --> 10:20.154
The Trags see her, they will want her head.

10:20.156 --> 10:21.906
But they will not act in the open.

10:21.908 --> 10:23.273
So don't worry.

10:23.275 --> 10:25.209
Your father would be
very touched to see you

10:25.211 --> 10:28.111
so concerned for a human.

10:28.831 --> 10:32.282
There's just so much he
was beginning to teach me...

10:32.284 --> 10:33.667
About being a leader,

10:33.669 --> 10:35.002
about our tribe,

10:35.004 --> 10:37.955
about... cyper.

10:37.957 --> 10:40.758
He must have thought you were ready.

10:40.760 --> 10:43.460
I just can't imagine being
responsible for someone's life.

10:43.462 --> 10:45.562
I mean, what if something went wrong?

10:45.564 --> 10:47.031
Oh, there are side effects:

10:47.033 --> 10:48.983
There's fatigue, euphoria.

10:48.985 --> 10:50.935
Well, that's preferable to death.

10:52.154 --> 10:53.637
Is there anything else I should know?

10:53.639 --> 10:55.606
Well, there are some rare
cases where the patient

10:55.608 --> 10:58.492
doesn't recover, or
their-their veins turn blue.

11:02.313 --> 11:03.831
I don't know if I believe that.

11:03.833 --> 11:05.366
I've never seen a blue Atrian.

11:05.368 --> 11:06.700
Well, that's because there's a cure.

11:06.702 --> 11:09.597
It's called vyre. The Iwabas tribe grow it.

11:09.606 --> 11:11.338
The trick is, you gotta
get it to the patient

11:11.340 --> 11:12.489
before it becomes permanent.

11:12.491 --> 11:14.827
The humans imprison us, run our lives,

11:14.836 --> 11:16.962
and now they want to walk around
the sector like it's a zoo?

11:16.971 --> 11:19.463
Careful. You're beginning
to sound like a Trag.

11:19.465 --> 11:21.855
At least the Trags are willing
to fight for our people.

11:21.863 --> 11:23.517
Get us out of this prison.

11:23.519 --> 11:27.137
No race mixing! Earth for earthlings!

11:27.139 --> 11:29.273
No race mixing! Earth for earthlings!

11:29.275 --> 11:31.174
Saw you and Uncle Castor talking.

11:31.176 --> 11:33.811
Did you come around on him?

11:33.813 --> 11:35.813
He can be helpful.

11:35.815 --> 11:39.650
Earth for earthlings! No race mixing!

11:41.352 --> 11:43.153
But dad never trusted him.

11:43.155 --> 11:45.372
Neither should we.

11:46.791 --> 11:49.159
The Red Hawks protest just
outside the sector gate

11:49.161 --> 11:50.544
even on a Saturday?

11:50.546 --> 11:53.213
Hate doesn't take a weekend.

11:56.419 --> 11:59.130
No race mixing! Earth for earthlings!

11:59.136 --> 12:00.638
Shall we?

12:02.307 --> 12:03.924
No race mixing! Earth for earthlings!

12:03.926 --> 12:06.343
No race mixing! Earth for earthlings!

12:20.325 --> 12:22.893
You've been put in groups of two.

12:22.895 --> 12:25.557
Each pair must be accompanied by
a guard during your visit here.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.614
Welcome to the sector.

13:04.435 --> 13:08.105
You really think this is the
best time to be buying souvenirs?

13:08.107 --> 13:09.318
I can feel the blue veins

13:09.325 --> 13:12.137
growing up my neck, so, yeah, I do.

13:12.888 --> 13:15.553
Okay, good news is there
is a cure. Bad news,

13:15.559 --> 13:16.911
if we don't get you that cure

13:16.917 --> 13:18.999
before the veins reach your
face, it'll be permanent.

13:19.636 --> 13:21.713
Please tell me you have the cure.

13:21.719 --> 13:23.887
I need some time.

13:23.889 --> 13:25.973
Can you meet me back here at noon?

13:25.975 --> 13:27.341
Roman.

13:27.343 --> 13:29.810
I was wondering if we could interview you

13:29.812 --> 13:31.428
and Sophia for Gloria's video.

13:31.430 --> 13:33.263
I was thinking we could
shoot it in your pod?

13:33.265 --> 13:36.528
No, you need to stay in the
main areas where it's safer.

13:36.529 --> 13:38.866
Then would you mind
introducing us to some Atrians

13:38.872 --> 13:40.968
who wouldn't mind sharing
their arrival day stories?

13:40.974 --> 13:43.740
I need you to focus on
your survival story...

13:43.742 --> 13:45.308
For once.

13:49.330 --> 13:51.365
You can interview me if you like.

13:51.367 --> 13:53.700
I'd love to have you visit our pod.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.752
Later, when my mother's not around?

13:55.754 --> 13:57.661
Thank you. That would be great.

13:57.661 --> 13:59.957
Yeah. No, awesome.

13:59.959 --> 14:03.594
Now, the best bang for your
buck in the marketplace? Dovor.

14:03.596 --> 14:05.662
Gives you a nice smooth buzz,

14:05.664 --> 14:07.464
but not too much. It'll make you feel like

14:07.466 --> 14:10.300
you got hit in the head with a gold brick.

14:20.365 --> 14:22.479
You can't sell drugs to humans.

14:22.481 --> 14:23.701
Let's go.

14:23.714 --> 14:25.816
One day, we're not gonna take it anymore.

14:25.818 --> 14:26.826
One day, we're gonna

14:26.839 --> 14:29.736
break down these walls,
and you'll be sorry.

14:30.905 --> 14:33.073
Now listen, um, I need a favor.

14:33.075 --> 14:34.741
I'm looking for vyre.

14:34.743 --> 14:36.910
Can you get some from
your tribe's grow house?

14:36.912 --> 14:38.879
Why do you need it?

14:38.881 --> 14:40.881
Just...

14:41.375 --> 14:43.366
I'm not helping unless you tell me.

14:45.720 --> 14:49.391
All right, I... I may
have used cyper on a human.

14:49.399 --> 14:50.767
I need the vyre to fix

14:50.767 --> 14:52.210
the side effects before anyone finds out.

14:52.218 --> 14:53.745
- Who'd you use it on?
- That's not important.

14:53.754 --> 14:55.145
You showed a human how cyper is used?

14:55.147 --> 14:56.980
Most Atrians don't even
have that information.

14:56.982 --> 14:59.266
If the Trags find out... Yeah, I know.

14:59.268 --> 15:00.567
That's why I'm asking you.

15:00.569 --> 15:03.437
You're the only person I
can trust that can help me.

15:03.439 --> 15:05.878
Maybe I used to have a reason to be

15:05.886 --> 15:08.671
on your side, but like you
said this morning, it's over.

15:28.819 --> 15:30.264
Vega.

15:30.266 --> 15:32.366
The Trags have honored me
by making me their leader.

15:32.368 --> 15:33.901
Do you know why you're here?

15:33.903 --> 15:35.953
I do.

15:35.955 --> 15:37.621
What is your answer?

15:37.866 --> 15:44.136
_

15:45.277 --> 15:47.268
I've waited a long time for this.

15:54.656 --> 15:57.774
Beaumont's marks can't be seen,
but they run as deep as yours.

15:57.776 --> 16:00.494
Before you become a full
brother of the Trags,

16:00.496 --> 16:02.248
you must prove yourself.

16:03.882 --> 16:05.882
We've been watching you for some time.

16:05.884 --> 16:07.467
And now destiny has chosen you.

16:07.469 --> 16:09.052
For ten years,

16:09.054 --> 16:11.722
no Atrian has been allowed
access to our own vessel,

16:11.724 --> 16:14.174
but we hear you and the Atrian seven

16:14.182 --> 16:17.394
have been invited to the
commemoration at the crash site.

16:17.396 --> 16:20.013
Tomorrow you will break into our ship,

16:20.015 --> 16:23.934
and together, we will
lay waste to the humans.

16:28.913 --> 16:30.781
When we were put in the sector,

16:30.783 --> 16:33.867
I'd go up on the rooftop
and look at the town.

16:33.869 --> 16:36.603
I couldn't wait to explore
those lights for myself

16:36.605 --> 16:38.956
and meet the people living there.

16:38.958 --> 16:41.925
It's a little hard to do from the sector,

16:41.927 --> 16:46.886
but in the meantime, I have
two of those people in my pod.

16:48.278 --> 16:50.641
Thank you again for inviting us.

16:50.650 --> 16:52.093
Do you mind if I...?

16:52.101 --> 16:53.671
Go ahead.

17:17.682 --> 17:19.733
What is it?

17:19.742 --> 17:22.054
I don't know. Roman's had it forever.

17:22.070 --> 17:24.001
Did he say where he got it?

17:24.002 --> 17:27.243
It's been so long, I don't
know if he even remembers.

17:30.442 --> 17:32.292
- Roman!
- You invited them here after

17:32.300 --> 17:33.650
I told you not to?

17:33.667 --> 17:34.873
What if mom finds out?

17:34.882 --> 17:36.468
- She won't!
- This is my fault.

17:36.468 --> 17:38.098
I asked to interview her.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.164
- Where is your guard?
- He's downstairs waiting.

17:40.172 --> 17:41.367
Then that's where you should be.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.550
With your guard and his gun.

17:42.625 --> 17:44.330
Dude, you need to relax.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.030
Was I talking to you?

17:46.038 --> 17:48.158
It's fine. We're leaving.

18:06.177 --> 18:09.263
The plants of the Swamad
tribe are used for farming.

18:09.265 --> 18:10.997
Necessary, but boring.

18:10.999 --> 18:15.469
Now, the Zwahan have
just one herb... cyper.

18:15.471 --> 18:18.272
It can bring someone back
from the brink of death.

18:18.274 --> 18:21.108
Sounds impressive,
unless you're in a fight,

18:21.110 --> 18:22.342
in which case it's useless.

18:30.034 --> 18:33.687
The fact is, the survival of
all Atrians depends on the plants

18:33.689 --> 18:38.208
and skills of our tribe;
The Vwasak, the warriors.

18:38.210 --> 18:41.578
Take sovok, it can turn any pressure point

18:41.580 --> 18:43.029
into a death sentence.

18:43.031 --> 18:47.387
The top of the head, the neck, the groin.

18:47.396 --> 18:49.503
If you want to join the Trags,

18:49.505 --> 18:51.471
you need to show me something!

18:51.473 --> 18:56.143
We can't have an untrained schoolboy
running around carrying out our orders!

19:01.195 --> 19:03.659
How'd you get rid of your birthmarks?

19:03.667 --> 19:06.460
I mean, you had to, right,
to live on the outside?

19:06.469 --> 19:08.494
What have you seen out there?

19:09.190 --> 19:11.325
Have you been to Eljida?

19:12.160 --> 19:14.507
That's a lot of questions.

19:14.853 --> 19:16.507
But if you truly want

19:16.516 --> 19:19.449
to be a warrior, there's only one
question you should be asking yourself:

19:19.451 --> 19:22.586
Are you willing to kill for your cause?

19:35.350 --> 19:38.073
Now we're getting somewhere.

19:38.970 --> 19:41.188
How'd you get rid of the guards?

19:41.190 --> 19:44.858
I talked on and on about my
specialty Atrian doll collection.

19:44.860 --> 19:47.594
They couldn't get away fast enough.

19:47.596 --> 19:49.279
So, do you have the cure?

19:49.281 --> 19:52.098
No, but I do know how to get it.

19:56.270 --> 19:59.039
Listen, I was thinking, maybe we should

19:59.041 --> 20:00.407
tell Emery what we're doing.

20:00.409 --> 20:02.793
No.

20:02.795 --> 20:04.745
I thought you might say that.

20:04.747 --> 20:07.825
It's just you've been kind of a jerk,

20:07.825 --> 20:09.884
and she's really hurting right now and...

20:09.893 --> 20:11.501
Seems like she's doing just fine.

20:11.503 --> 20:13.860
You obviously care about her.

20:15.159 --> 20:17.515
You betrayed your people to save a human.

20:17.523 --> 20:19.759
And you did it for her.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.034
After what Emery's father did,

20:23.042 --> 20:24.553
there's a lot of Atrians who would rather

20:24.561 --> 20:26.266
see her dead than see her with me.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.967
Why can't you tell her that?

20:27.969 --> 20:31.188
I tried to tell her that she
was in danger at the carnival.

20:31.190 --> 20:33.940
Didn't stop her from
coming to the sector today.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.725
She is stubborn like that.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.445
The closer she is to me, the more danger...

20:41.316 --> 20:43.917
The more danger she is in.

20:43.919 --> 20:46.434
I'm doing everything I can to change that.

20:47.227 --> 20:49.041
But until then, if being a jerk's

20:49.050 --> 20:50.274
the only way to keep her safe,

20:50.274 --> 20:52.228
then that's what I'm gonna have to be.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.464
Come on.

21:00.218 --> 21:02.799
So, the Trags have enlisted Drake.

21:03.516 --> 21:05.896
What do they want with
such a blunt instrument?

21:06.403 --> 21:07.753
He and the Atrian seven

21:07.761 --> 21:08.942
have been invited to the ship

21:08.944 --> 21:10.277
for the commemoration.

21:10.279 --> 21:12.612
The Trags want him to
break into the vessel.

21:12.614 --> 21:14.231
Best way to ensure our survival

21:14.233 --> 21:15.682
is not to stop the war between

21:15.684 --> 21:17.401
the Trags and the humans,

21:17.403 --> 21:19.403
but to always make sure
we're on the winning side.

21:20.703 --> 21:22.366
Have you kept your eye

21:22.370 --> 21:24.458
on Roman and Emery Whitehill?

21:24.460 --> 21:26.376
He's been keeping his distance.

21:26.378 --> 21:27.911
Don't let him fool you.

21:27.913 --> 21:30.047
He likes her.

21:30.049 --> 21:32.015
Which complicates things.

21:32.017 --> 21:34.367
You want me to take care of her?

21:35.342 --> 21:37.097
No.

21:37.488 --> 21:40.373
Leave her to me.

21:47.315 --> 21:49.816
Hey. Hey.

21:49.818 --> 21:52.018
Think we got some good stuff.

21:53.053 --> 21:55.221
Where's Julia?

21:55.223 --> 21:58.408
I think she ditched me again.

22:03.064 --> 22:05.086
Did I just win?

22:23.718 --> 22:25.005
The pictures you take.

22:25.013 --> 22:26.937
Can people outside the sector see them?

22:26.939 --> 22:28.388
Uh, yeah.

22:30.709 --> 22:32.363
That's my mom.

22:32.363 --> 22:33.760
We lost her on arrival day

22:33.762 --> 22:35.812
when I was a baby. My dad said she lives

22:35.814 --> 22:37.096
in Eljida now.

22:37.098 --> 22:38.331
But one day

22:38.333 --> 22:39.449
we'll all be back together.

22:39.451 --> 22:42.369
Can you take me now?

22:42.371 --> 22:44.037
Sure.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.800
I apologize for my fellow Atrians,

23:13.802 --> 23:15.185
but this place is sacred to them.

23:15.187 --> 23:17.404
They don't look kindly on interlopers.

23:18.401 --> 23:20.249
What is this place?

23:20.249 --> 23:22.442
This is the wall of the missing.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.528
This was created when we were first

23:24.530 --> 23:25.645
placed in the sector.

23:25.647 --> 23:27.447
It's a memorial

23:27.449 --> 23:29.916
for all the family members
that were lost on arrival day.

23:29.918 --> 23:32.419
That girl said her mom's still alive.

23:32.421 --> 23:33.870
Some Atrians believe

23:33.872 --> 23:35.589
that the missing escaped

23:35.591 --> 23:37.057
and made a home for themselves:

23:37.059 --> 23:38.208
Eljida.

23:38.210 --> 23:41.160
Does Eljida really exist?

23:41.162 --> 23:43.630
Who knows?

23:43.632 --> 23:45.532
But it gives them hope.

23:46.634 --> 23:48.935
I'm... I'm Castor.

23:48.937 --> 23:50.503
I'm Roman's Uncle.

23:50.505 --> 23:53.490
I... I find it interesting
that you two are friends.

23:54.559 --> 23:56.092
What's interesting about it?

23:56.094 --> 23:58.528
Well, your father, his father,

23:58.530 --> 24:00.030
the unfortunate accident.

24:00.032 --> 24:02.782
I don't think Roman
would consider us friends.

24:02.784 --> 24:04.668
What would he consider you?

24:06.370 --> 24:07.871
I should go.

24:07.873 --> 24:10.523
My friends are probably waiting for me.

24:10.525 --> 24:12.692
Of course.

24:29.543 --> 24:31.094
Where are we?

24:31.096 --> 24:33.513
The grow house of the Iwabas,

24:33.515 --> 24:34.981
the mystic tribe.

24:34.983 --> 24:36.933
We're looking for a plant with red twigs.

24:36.935 --> 24:38.184
It's called vyre.

24:38.186 --> 24:39.436
The faster we find it,

24:39.438 --> 24:42.555
the faster we can get out of here.

24:48.080 --> 24:49.529
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

24:59.290 --> 25:00.800
Roman.

25:02.593 --> 25:03.843
What are you doing here?

25:03.845 --> 25:05.262
Well...

25:07.431 --> 25:10.433
The door was open, and
I... I just had to look.

25:10.435 --> 25:12.085
I've always been fascinated

25:12.087 --> 25:13.853
by the plants of the Iwabas.

25:15.772 --> 25:17.468
Our plants are the most varied

25:17.468 --> 25:19.578
and interesting of all the tribes.

25:20.405 --> 25:23.697
This one, for example.

25:23.699 --> 25:25.598
Bylek.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.150
When plunged into your spinal cord,

25:27.152 --> 25:29.268
it paralyzes your sensory and motor nerves,

25:29.270 --> 25:32.372
causing your pain receptors to fire.

25:32.374 --> 25:35.075
It will feel like you're being

25:35.077 --> 25:36.710
skinned alive.

25:41.437 --> 25:42.281
Now...

25:42.290 --> 25:44.301
Why don't you tell me what
you're really doing here?

25:49.176 --> 25:53.218
- Last chance, Roman.
- I told you the truth.

25:54.130 --> 25:55.151
Wrong answer.

25:55.151 --> 25:56.316
Mom?

25:57.464 --> 25:58.733
Teri.

25:58.735 --> 26:00.952
I was just about to tell your mother

26:00.954 --> 26:02.537
that we had a date.

26:02.539 --> 26:04.188
Here.

26:04.190 --> 26:05.624
Is this true?

26:06.459 --> 26:08.106
Yes.

26:12.665 --> 26:14.866
Why didn't you say so before?

26:14.868 --> 26:17.886
Well, with all due respect...

26:17.888 --> 26:19.399
You were going to torture me for just being

26:19.399 --> 26:20.781
in the grow house.

26:20.783 --> 26:22.226
I didn't know what you'd do to me

26:22.234 --> 26:23.989
if I said I was gonna meet your daughter.

26:26.742 --> 26:29.890
Don't let me find you here again.

26:31.882 --> 26:33.839
It's fine.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.874
You should be careful with Roman.

26:43.891 --> 26:45.258
He shares his father's

26:45.266 --> 26:47.999
same perverse love for the humans.

26:48.001 --> 26:50.568
His influence is making you weak.

26:50.570 --> 26:52.921
Are you done?

26:52.923 --> 26:56.007
Roman is keeping you from
embracing your destiny.

26:56.009 --> 26:58.343
As a member of this tribe.

26:58.345 --> 26:59.678
As a Trag.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.013
As my daughter.

27:02.523 --> 27:04.349
One day soon, you will

27:04.351 --> 27:07.852
have to choose where your loyalties lie:

27:07.854 --> 27:09.888
With Roman...

27:09.890 --> 27:11.740
Or with your family.

27:22.021 --> 27:25.464
We actually have a few
interviews for Gloria's video.

27:25.464 --> 27:27.155
Not just footage of you

27:27.157 --> 27:29.824
getting yelled at by Atrians.

27:29.826 --> 27:32.344
The commemoration tomorrow...

27:32.346 --> 27:33.995
It must be hard on your family.

27:33.997 --> 27:36.147
I'm sure you're thinking
about your brother a lot.

27:36.149 --> 27:39.084
I think it'll be hard for everyone there.

27:39.481 --> 27:40.738
How are they gonna feel

27:40.747 --> 27:43.454
when the Atrians show up?

27:43.456 --> 27:44.923
Honestly?

27:44.925 --> 27:47.270
I think a lot of people will hate it.

27:47.278 --> 27:49.394
And our video.

27:49.396 --> 27:50.734
Well, if you thought that,

27:50.742 --> 27:53.264
then why'd you offer to help me?

27:53.266 --> 27:55.066
You seemed like you needed it.

27:56.318 --> 27:58.770
And I wanted some fried pickles.

28:21.711 --> 28:23.995
Your parents...

28:23.997 --> 28:26.131
Yeah.

28:26.133 --> 28:29.217
- Your mom's so...
- Stuffy?

28:29.219 --> 28:32.020
Snobby? Emotionally remote?

28:32.022 --> 28:34.172
I was going to say elegant.

28:34.174 --> 28:35.806
I showed Gloria the
video, and she loved it.

28:35.808 --> 28:37.341
But we have to upload it right now.

28:37.343 --> 28:39.644
I'm on it. Save me a seat?

28:39.646 --> 28:41.179
Yeah. Sure.

29:03.559 --> 29:05.138
Roman...

29:08.783 --> 29:10.642
It's vyre.

29:10.644 --> 29:12.427
I'm only doing this

29:12.429 --> 29:14.479
to keep my mother from torturing you.

29:14.481 --> 29:16.481
Thank you.

29:17.316 --> 29:18.900
Be careful.

29:18.902 --> 29:20.718
No one knows how vyre works on humans.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.887
It will cure the
side-effect of cyper, but...

29:22.889 --> 29:24.739
There's no telling what else it will do.

29:25.891 --> 29:27.725
Keep it moving.

29:48.247 --> 29:49.797
I have it.

29:49.799 --> 29:52.183
- The vyre.
- Thank God.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.635
What do I do with it?

29:54.652 --> 29:56.387
You eat it.

29:56.389 --> 29:57.401
But...

29:57.410 --> 29:58.650
Maybe this is too big a risk.

29:58.650 --> 29:59.722
After all of your warnings

29:59.730 --> 30:01.359
about exposing the secret of cyper?

30:05.118 --> 30:07.624
Look, if anyone finds out how I was cured,

30:07.624 --> 30:09.489
they'll lock me up in a lab, too.

30:09.498 --> 30:12.120
I've spent plenty of time in the hospital.

30:12.122 --> 30:13.771
I won't go back to that.

30:13.773 --> 30:15.384
And besides...

30:15.384 --> 30:17.492
You saved my life.

30:17.494 --> 30:19.544
This is the least I can do.

30:26.302 --> 30:28.920
Sir, I need you to come with me.

30:53.113 --> 30:54.662
Welcome.

30:54.664 --> 30:57.415
Today we honor those we've lost,

30:57.417 --> 31:00.649
but we also look to the future.

31:00.657 --> 31:02.311
It's time.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.501
I've disabled the security gate

31:03.509 --> 31:05.003
that leads into the ship.

31:05.011 --> 31:07.476
You should be able to
get in and out undetected.

31:07.476 --> 31:09.670
But if not...

31:13.015 --> 31:14.999
Knock 'em dead.

31:18.220 --> 31:19.736
I could tell you

31:19.736 --> 31:21.851
about the success of
our integration program,

31:21.859 --> 31:26.855
but I'll let you see the
results for yourselves.

31:30.616 --> 31:34.522
I was five when our ship crashed on Earth.

31:36.205 --> 31:38.740
When we left our home
planet, my father told me...

31:40.577 --> 31:44.195
I am the grand patriarch of the Red Hawks.

31:44.197 --> 31:45.862
For too long, the government has hidden

31:45.871 --> 31:48.361
the truth about Atrians
but today, we'll show you

31:48.361 --> 31:49.787
what they don't want you to see.

31:49.796 --> 31:50.969
One day, we're gonna break down

31:50.969 --> 31:52.637
these walls, and you'll be sorry.

31:54.757 --> 31:57.041
Get that video down!

31:57.062 --> 32:01.011
Alien demons, they don't
want to assimilate with us.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.264
They want to annihilate us.

32:03.273 --> 32:05.099
And hand to God,

32:05.101 --> 32:08.853
we will send every last
one of them back to hell!

32:21.967 --> 32:24.280
What are we gonna do?

32:41.234 --> 32:43.401
My name is Roman.

32:43.403 --> 32:48.256
I'm the son of Nox, the
late leader of the Atrians.

32:48.258 --> 32:52.277
I'm here to say that what you just saw...

32:52.279 --> 32:55.664
There is some truth to that.

34:30.072 --> 34:33.428
Instead of helping or
learning from each other,

34:33.429 --> 34:36.514
we go to great lengths to hide the truth.

34:56.726 --> 34:58.025
The video was supposed

34:58.034 --> 35:02.236
to be of Atrians telling
their arrival day stories.

35:03.627 --> 35:05.443
I'd like to share mine.

35:06.017 --> 35:09.351
That Red Hawk said that
humans don't want us here.

35:09.368 --> 35:10.617
Well, I know that's not true.

35:10.634 --> 35:13.001
Because on arrival day,

35:13.003 --> 35:16.004
I met a human girl who saved my life.

35:16.006 --> 35:19.224
I wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for her.

35:21.140 --> 35:25.047
But if I met her today,
we couldn't walk down

35:25.064 --> 35:26.060
the street together

35:26.068 --> 35:29.066
without causing harm to one or both of us.

35:29.066 --> 35:31.736
That's the reality of our world.

35:32.213 --> 35:34.981
The integration program isn't perfect.

35:34.990 --> 35:38.142
But it has shown me that
there are more humans out there

35:38.144 --> 35:41.446
like that girl than there are Red Hawks.

35:41.448 --> 35:45.540
And that gives me hope, hope that someday,

35:47.346 --> 35:50.288
we will be able to come together.

36:08.508 --> 36:11.307
Please don't do it. Please?

36:12.300 --> 36:14.351
Please don't kill me. Please?

36:14.362 --> 36:16.210
I have a family.

36:17.509 --> 36:21.536
No!

36:42.728 --> 36:44.956
He won't remember a thing when he wakes up.

36:44.964 --> 36:46.745
How'd you know?

36:46.753 --> 36:48.885
My mother is a leader of the Trags.

36:48.893 --> 36:50.767
There's not much I don't know.

36:50.775 --> 36:53.712
But why are you helping out now?

36:53.720 --> 36:57.188
It's time I embraced my destiny.

37:00.113 --> 37:01.701
Nicely done.

37:02.055 --> 37:04.572
If it wasn't for your speech,
the integration program

37:04.574 --> 37:07.092
and your father's work
would've gone down the drain.

37:07.395 --> 37:08.923
You wouldn't have given up

37:08.923 --> 37:10.349
on integration, though.

37:10.357 --> 37:13.498
No. But I'm only interested
in programs that work.

37:13.500 --> 37:16.401
Thanks to you, this one still does.

37:18.120 --> 37:23.727
As you saw, Roman represents
the candor and optimism

37:23.736 --> 37:24.833
of his generation,

37:24.841 --> 37:26.420
which will pave the way for integration

37:26.428 --> 37:27.778
across this nation

37:27.787 --> 37:29.947
and the world.

37:36.255 --> 37:39.557
Find Grayson, tell him
we're ready to leave.

37:44.498 --> 37:47.561
I can't believe we had to
sit and listen through Gloria

37:47.570 --> 37:49.080
prattle on about integration.

37:49.080 --> 37:50.687
It was worth it to see the look

37:50.696 --> 37:51.949
on her face when our video came on.

37:51.957 --> 37:55.680
And you're sure they can't
trace it back to us or Grayson?

37:55.682 --> 37:56.765
I handled it. Stop worrying.

37:56.767 --> 37:58.884
- Emery.
- Don't touch me!

37:58.886 --> 38:03.306
Emery, let me explain.
Emery, let me explain!

38:04.507 --> 38:08.037
Explain what? Your father
isn't the grand patriarch

38:08.045 --> 38:10.313
for the Red Hawks, that he
didn't use the footage we shot

38:10.315 --> 38:12.198
for that horrible video?!

38:15.452 --> 38:17.975
I can't tell you that.

38:17.984 --> 38:20.022
Oh, my God...

38:20.024 --> 38:22.490
You used me so you could
shoot in the sector.

38:22.499 --> 38:25.537
No! My parents are who they are,
okay, but I am not a Red Hawk.

38:25.545 --> 38:26.640
I don't believe you.

38:26.642 --> 38:27.944
It's true. They must have

38:27.953 --> 38:29.294
stolen the video from me last night.

38:29.303 --> 38:31.134
The things your father said,

38:31.143 --> 38:32.983
how could you live under the same roof?

38:32.991 --> 38:34.503
Emery, I understand how you feel.

38:34.505 --> 38:36.038
I live with it every day.

38:36.040 --> 38:38.007
I just pretend to get
along with the Red Hawks.

38:38.009 --> 38:42.122
But... they're my parents.

38:42.813 --> 38:45.982
I can't be around you right now.

38:56.487 --> 38:59.929
Hey, that guard I saw you
with earlier... Beaumont.

38:59.931 --> 39:01.436
What'd he want?

39:01.442 --> 39:02.762
- It was nothing.
- It wasn't nothing.

39:02.767 --> 39:03.817
He's a Trag and he's dangerous.

39:03.864 --> 39:05.785
We don't have to explain ourselves to you.

39:05.787 --> 39:08.871
And you don't have to pretend
to care about us anymore.

39:15.813 --> 39:17.813
Roman!

39:21.705 --> 39:23.350
It worked!

39:23.359 --> 39:26.105
Uh-huh. It worked.

39:29.894 --> 39:32.288
Thank you.

39:44.574 --> 39:46.728
You brought me what I asked for.

39:46.728 --> 39:50.446
More importantly, you brought
my daughter to the fold.

39:51.632 --> 39:53.883
I'm not conflicted anymore.

39:53.885 --> 39:56.408
I know where my loyalties lie.

39:57.083 --> 39:59.741
You are now a full brother of the Trags.

39:59.741 --> 40:01.469
We will spill the blood of your enemies

40:01.478 --> 40:03.376
as you have spilled the blood of ours.

40:03.385 --> 40:06.490
As a reward for completing your mission...

40:08.591 --> 40:12.189
You'll have a glimpse of what is to come.

40:12.814 --> 40:14.721
That's cyper.

40:14.721 --> 40:17.173
Not as you've seen it before.

40:35.460 --> 40:36.995
He was a traitor.

40:36.995 --> 40:38.582
One of our spies caught him

40:38.590 --> 40:40.828
giving information to
Castor behind our back.

40:40.836 --> 40:42.465
With loyal soldiers like yourself,

40:42.467 --> 40:46.185
we will unleash black cyper on the humans.

41:19.753 --> 41:22.371
Female computerized voice:

41:29.701 --> 41:30.933
Mommy!

41:30.933 --> 41:32.798
Oh, here's my boy.
