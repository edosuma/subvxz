WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
The following programme contains
strong language and violent scenes.

00:11.120 --> 00:14.920
You can't turn back time
to stop what happened to Sarah.

00:17.200 --> 00:20.280
A nuclear warhead nicknamed Big Boy

00:20.320 --> 00:23.320
was highjacked.
The key's the detonator.

00:23.360 --> 00:24.000
There's a code in there.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.400
There's a code in there.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.120
We just have to crack it.
It's an IP address.

00:45.280 --> 00:47.160
You worked out where Big Boy is.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.920
I'm gonna bring her back, Shiv!

01:43.040 --> 01:44.000
Archie?
Yeah?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.120
Archie?
Yeah?

01:46.160 --> 01:50.360
Matthew Rogers. We had an
appointment to meet earlier.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.000
Your professor set it up.
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.040
Your professor set it up.
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.000
That's all right.
I meant to come and find you

01:56.040 --> 01:58.480
but I have a 10,000 word essay
on European trade associations

01:58.520 --> 02:00.000
due on Monday, plus my roommate's
boyfriend just proposed to her

02:00.000 --> 02:01.200
due on Monday, plus my roommate's
boyfriend just proposed to her

02:01.240 --> 02:03.240
and I needed to talk
her out of marrying a man

02:03.280 --> 02:05.600
whose greatest ambition in life
is to one day be retired.

02:05.640 --> 02:08.000
Also, there was this ball and,
you know, this doesn't just happen.

02:08.000 --> 02:08.960
Also, there was this ball and,
you know, this doesn't just happen.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Of course. Don't worry about it.

02:11.040 --> 02:14.120
I expect your professor told you
why I wanted to speak to you?

02:14.160 --> 02:16.000
He did not. Oh? Have you
considered your future, Archie?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
He did not. Oh? Have you
considered your future, Archie?

02:18.040 --> 02:21.520
Have I considered my future?
Well, let's see.

02:21.560 --> 02:24.000
I was top of my class in junior,
secondary and sixth-form college.

02:24.000 --> 02:24.200
I was top of my class in junior,
secondary and sixth-form college.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.000
I was first violin
in the school orchestra,

02:26.040 --> 02:27.920
captained the girls
volley and football team.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.280
Was head prefect, would have
been head girl if it wasn't for

02:30.320 --> 02:32.000
a dirty campaign run by Katie Clark,
which I refused to lower myself to.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.200
a dirty campaign run by Katie Clark,
which I refused to lower myself to.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.880
I volunteered for community projects
helping disaffected youth

02:35.920 --> 02:38.840
and disenfranchised elderly, ran a
breakfast and an after-school club.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.000
Got 15 A to A-star GCSEs
and five A-star AS and A2 levels.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.720
Got 15 A to A-star GCSEs
and five A-star AS and A2 levels.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.520
I worked at an ethically sourced
cocoa-bean plantation in Costa Rica

02:45.560 --> 02:48.000
in my gap year and was the first
student from my school to be awarded

02:48.000 --> 02:48.280
in my gap year and was the first
student from my school to be awarded

02:48.320 --> 02:51.200
an unconditional offer to study
politics, psychology and sociology

02:51.240 --> 02:54.200
at Cambridge University,
which is where you find me now.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.000
Do I sound like someone
who's not considered my future?

02:56.000 --> 02:56.720
Do I sound like someone
who's not considered my future?

02:56.760 --> 02:58.680
So, what do you want to do?

02:58.720 --> 03:00.600
I don't know.

03:05.520 --> 03:08.240
Is the champagne still free? I keep
telling you, it's free all night.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.520
Well, sometimes it's only
free up until a certain point.

03:11.520 --> 03:12.000
Let me ask you this.
Have you ever thought about

03:12.000 --> 03:14.400
Let me ask you this.
Have you ever thought about

03:14.440 --> 03:16.320
working for your government?

03:16.360 --> 03:19.360
What girl hasn't lustfully gazed at
the civil service fast-track scheme?

03:19.400 --> 03:20.000
I'm not talking about
the civil service.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I'm not talking about
the civil service.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.320
5 or 6?
Excuse me?

03:26.360 --> 03:28.000
MI5 or MI6?

03:28.000 --> 03:28.680
MI5 or MI6?

03:28.720 --> 03:30.880
I can't tell you.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.920
Which one's the cool one?

03:32.960 --> 03:36.000
The one I'm in.
Right.

03:36.000 --> 03:36.240
The one I'm in.
Right.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.280
The intelligence service
is always on the lookout

03:38.320 --> 03:40.800
for bright young minds, your CV
is fairly exceptional so far.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.600
I told you I didn't
make head girl, right?

03:42.640 --> 03:44.000
I heard Katie Clark
ran a real dirty campaign.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.040
I heard Katie Clark
ran a real dirty campaign.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.800
Which I wouldn't lower myself to,
that's right. This is my card.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.480
Is it gonna
self-destruct in ten seconds?

03:51.520 --> 03:52.000
No. Am I the first person
to make that joke?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.520
No. Am I the first person
to make that joke?

03:53.560 --> 03:55.080
No.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.960
OK. You should call the number
on it. You know the price tag

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
is sticking out the back
of your dress by the way.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
is sticking out the back
of your dress by the way.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.800
Fucking spies.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.000
OK! Let's go!

04:53.440 --> 04:55.000
Cheers.
Beautiful work.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.000
Oh! Who the fuck are you?!

05:04.000 --> 05:04.120
Oh! Who the fuck are you?!

05:04.160 --> 05:07.720
I'm not here to hurt you. Love to
echo the sentiment but if you don't

05:07.760 --> 05:10.080
tell me who you are in the next
five seconds, I'll knock your

05:10.120 --> 05:12.000
head through the wall! You couldn't
knock my head through the wall.

05:12.000 --> 05:12.800
head through the wall! You couldn't
knock my head through the wall.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.840
Why not?

05:14.880 --> 05:17.480
MI5 combat training's a joke.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I'm Shiv.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.040
Who do you work for?

05:25.080 --> 05:27.080
You haven't heard of us.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.000
You robbed an armoured truck today.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.280
You robbed an armoured truck today.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.840
I expect the adrenaline
hasn't worn off yet.

05:31.880 --> 05:35.560
I find lots of tea with
lots of sugar in it helps.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.000
Lots of tea with lots of sugar?
Yeah.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.240
Lots of tea with lots of sugar?
Yeah.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.640
And do you always bring a thermos
when you break into someone's house?

05:42.680 --> 05:44.000
Well, you never know when people
are gonna run out of tea bags.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.960
Well, you never know when people
are gonna run out of tea bags.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.280
How thoughtful.
Exactly.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.840
So, I know who you are, Archie.

05:51.880 --> 05:52.000
I know you're MI5, I know
you're 12 months undercover

05:52.000 --> 05:54.560
I know you're MI5, I know
you're 12 months undercover

05:54.600 --> 05:57.320
in Georgie Cunningham's operation.
And I know you're not gonna like

05:57.360 --> 05:59.760
what I'm about to tell you.
What's that?

05:59.800 --> 06:00.000
Cunningham's off the hook.
You're going to back off.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.880
Cunningham's off the hook.
You're going to back off.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.000
Georgie Cunningham has links
to organised crime throughout

06:08.000 --> 06:08.200
Georgie Cunningham has links
to organised crime throughout

06:08.240 --> 06:11.040
Europe and the Middle East. He's
involved in the smuggling of drugs,

06:11.080 --> 06:13.520
weapons and people and now he's
got enough capital behind him

06:13.560 --> 06:16.000
to grow his operation ten-fold.
He's not small time,

06:16.000 --> 06:16.080
to grow his operation ten-fold.
He's not small time,

06:16.120 --> 06:18.640
he's dangerous and he's going down.

06:18.680 --> 06:22.000
I'm fine for tea.
Amazing.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.000
That's almost exactly
what you said last time.

06:24.000 --> 06:24.800
That's almost exactly
what you said last time.

06:24.840 --> 06:27.640
What?

06:28.640 --> 06:31.080
Look, Georgie Cunningham
is a bad man,

06:31.120 --> 06:32.000
I only wish the very worst for him.
But if you arrest him,

06:32.000 --> 06:33.360
I only wish the very worst for him.
But if you arrest him,

06:33.400 --> 06:36.960
an associate of his in Israel makes
a deal with someone they shouldn't.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Trouble will brew.
Too much trouble, as it turns out.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.520
Trouble will brew.
Too much trouble, as it turns out.

06:41.560 --> 06:44.080
And how do you know that?

06:44.120 --> 06:46.920
You know what the interesting
thing about a disaster is?

06:48.440 --> 06:52.080
If you break it down, it's really
just an escalating series

06:52.120 --> 06:55.600
of mundane interactions
leading to a catastrophic climax.

06:55.640 --> 06:56.000
I've been on dates like that.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I've been on dates like that.

06:58.040 --> 07:02.840
Look, Archie, my job is to work out

07:02.880 --> 07:04.000
what would be the simplest,
easiest thing to rearrange

07:04.000 --> 07:06.160
what would be the simplest,
easiest thing to rearrange

07:06.200 --> 07:08.680
to ensure disaster
doesn't take place.

07:08.720 --> 07:12.000
And, er, and that's why
I'm in your kitchen tonight.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.040
And, er, and that's why
I'm in your kitchen tonight.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.800
I'm sorry, I still don't understand
what the hell you're talking about.

07:22.600 --> 07:26.320
Think of this. A woman goes
to leave her apartment in Paris.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.000
She stops to feed her cat.
It takes 20 seconds.

07:28.000 --> 07:28.920
She stops to feed her cat.
It takes 20 seconds.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.200
She gets in her car,
she drives through town,

07:31.240 --> 07:34.000
she stalls at a junction.
The vehicle behind her swerves.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.000
Its headlights dazzle the view
of the driver coming the other way

07:36.000 --> 07:36.760
Its headlights dazzle the view
of the driver coming the other way

07:36.800 --> 07:40.280
and, bang, Princess Diana
just crashed into a tunnel

07:40.320 --> 07:42.520
and Elton John's about
to sell a lot of records.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.000
Now, if I wanted to go back
in time to stop that from happening,

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Now, if I wanted to go back
in time to stop that from happening,

07:45.040 --> 07:47.640
I could either try to re-route
the princess or I could get someone

07:47.680 --> 07:51.760
to feed their cat 20 seconds
earlier. You know what I'm saying?

07:51.800 --> 07:52.000
It's, er, the simplest of things
make the biggest difference.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.240
It's, er, the simplest of things
make the biggest difference.

07:56.240 --> 07:59.160
I mean, who knows, maybe the very
act of me eating that burrito

07:59.200 --> 08:00.000
might change the world.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.120
might change the world.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.480
So, I'm the cat lady
in this analogy?

08:03.520 --> 08:05.760
Yeah.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.760
And who's Princess Diana?

08:07.800 --> 08:08.000
What are you trying to stop?
I can't tell you. And you expect me

08:08.000 --> 08:11.200
What are you trying to stop?
I can't tell you. And you expect me

08:11.240 --> 08:13.800
to abort a year-long
undercover operation for that?

08:13.840 --> 08:16.000
I did, the first time.

08:16.000 --> 08:16.400
I did, the first time.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.840
But you took matters into your own
hands and bollocksed everything up.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.000
So here we are, trying again.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.120
So here we are, trying again.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.720
The thing is, Archie,
I'm not asking.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.280
Cunningham's off the hook.

08:32.320 --> 08:35.440
I suppose the question is,
can you live with that?

08:37.680 --> 08:39.760
I could knock
your head through the wall.

08:39.800 --> 08:40.000
I know.
Really, who do you work for?

08:40.000 --> 08:43.720
I know.
Really, who do you work for?

08:45.400 --> 08:47.760
It's called The Lazarus Project.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.360
And I think you'll fit right in.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.000
Step back! Step away!

09:04.000 --> 09:05.240
Step back! Step away!

09:06.320 --> 09:08.560
What the hell happened?

09:08.600 --> 09:11.240
He's killed him.
You want us to sedate him?

09:11.280 --> 09:12.000
I can't question him
if he's unconscious, can I?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.800
I can't question him
if he's unconscious, can I?

09:14.840 --> 09:17.400
Put him in restraints
and don't turn your back on him.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.000
What happened?
Rebrov killed Ryan.

09:28.000 --> 09:28.480
What happened?
Rebrov killed Ryan.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.280
Ryan from tech support? Yeah.
What was one of the IT guys

09:31.320 --> 09:33.800
doing seeing Rebrov? I don't know.
Why would he kill him?

09:33.840 --> 09:36.000
I don't know. Where are Shiv
and George? I don't know.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.960
We don't know a lot. No. Let's
work on that, shall we? Yes, ma'am.

09:45.720 --> 09:48.560
I need to get into this computer.
That's Ryan's.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.280
I know it's Ryan's.
Well, he was here five minutes ago.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.000
Yeah, he's not here any more.
Well, he'll probably be back soon.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.800
Yeah, he's not here any more.
Well, he'll probably be back soon.

09:54.840 --> 09:57.040
No, I really don't think he will.
Is there an IT guy here?

09:57.080 --> 09:59.520
Ryan's the IT guy.
Is there another fucking IT guy?

09:59.560 --> 10:00.000
We have a time machine, I assume
we have more than one person

10:00.000 --> 10:01.920
We have a time machine, I assume
we have more than one person

10:01.960 --> 10:05.320
who can unlock a computer!
No. Ryan's the only one in today.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.200
Fucking hell, Jesus Christ.
Do me a favour?

10:07.240 --> 10:08.000
Get on the phone and get
all the IT guys we have to come in.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.600
Get on the phone and get
all the IT guys we have to come in.

10:09.640 --> 10:13.000
All of them? All of them. I want
an army of nerds walking through

10:13.040 --> 10:16.000
that door in the next 30 minutes.
Why? Isn't Ryan coming back?

10:16.000 --> 10:16.840
that door in the next 30 minutes.
Why? Isn't Ryan coming back?

10:16.880 --> 10:19.120
Do you hear the alarm, Dane?

10:19.160 --> 10:21.200
Do you see everyone running around?

10:21.240 --> 10:23.160
Oh, shit. Did the world end again?

10:23.200 --> 10:24.000
I don't know. Maybe.
IT guys now, please.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.800
I don't know. Maybe.
IT guys now, please.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.840
Yeah, OK. Yeah, yeah.

10:38.120 --> 10:40.000
You worked out where Big Boy is.

10:40.000 --> 10:40.120
You worked out where Big Boy is.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.920
I'm gonna bring her back, Shiv.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.160
I'm gonna bring you back too.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.000
The first thing
I'm gonna do is come for you.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.280
The first thing
I'm gonna do is come for you.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.560
I know.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.600
OK, OK, OK. Let's fucking go.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.520
For fuck's sake.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.680
Ryan worked here for five years.

12:23.960 --> 12:24.000
He had a wife and a child.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.840
He had a wife and a child.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.040
After I speak to you,
I'm going back upstairs to ring them

12:31.080 --> 12:32.000
and tell them that he
died in a workplace accident.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.960
and tell them that he
died in a workplace accident.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.520
There'll be an investigation
and a large pay out.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.000
We'll attend the funeral.

12:40.000 --> 12:40.800
We'll attend the funeral.

12:41.800 --> 12:46.040
I will watch his family cry as
his body is lowered into the ground.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.000
So before I do that, Dennis...

12:48.000 --> 12:49.120
So before I do that, Dennis...

12:50.880 --> 12:54.040
..could you tell me
why you killed him?

12:54.080 --> 12:56.000
He gave me the code.

12:56.000 --> 12:56.080
He gave me the code.

12:56.120 --> 13:00.240
The code? Specific sentence
that can mean only one thing.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.200
Kill the person who just said it.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.000
Like when you're
broadcasting under duress?

13:04.000 --> 13:04.640
Like when you're
broadcasting under duress?

13:04.680 --> 13:07.880
Exactly. Do you still use
'ballerina' by the way?

13:07.920 --> 13:11.480
We changed it. Why?
Because you fucking know what it is!

13:11.520 --> 13:12.000
So, you don't know
why you killed Ryan,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.520
So, you don't know
why you killed Ryan,

13:13.560 --> 13:16.000
you just knew you had to do it.
That's right.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.680
Who would have given Ryan the code?

13:20.680 --> 13:24.280
I suspect, ma'am,

13:24.320 --> 13:26.600
it would have been
given to him by the mole

13:26.640 --> 13:28.000
working within this organisation.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.640
working within this organisation.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.800
We don't have a mole.
Sure.

13:31.840 --> 13:35.240
The Lost Glory probably tipped
themselves off that you were coming.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.560
I'm not gonna just
tell you who it is.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.520
Not without some guarantees.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.000
Letting you walk free
isn't gonna be on the table.

13:44.000 --> 13:44.560
Letting you walk free
isn't gonna be on the table.

13:44.600 --> 13:48.120
You don't have the authority
to make that decision.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.880
You do.

14:23.080 --> 14:24.000
Come on, come on.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.360
Come on, come on.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.840
Shit.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.000
I'm sorry, mate. I'm... I'm English.

14:40.000 --> 14:40.200
I'm sorry, mate. I'm... I'm English.

14:40.240 --> 14:43.720
Is this your car?
Yep. No.

14:43.760 --> 14:47.240
I'm borrowing it.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.000
This car has been reported stolen.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.960
This car has been reported stolen.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.120
This... This car?
Uh-hm.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.720
No. That's... That's a mistake.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.000
Because, um, I... Yeah.
I'm borrowing it from a mate.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.720
Because, um, I... Yeah.
I'm borrowing it from a mate.

14:57.760 --> 15:02.160
So, maybe one of his neighbours,
er, saw me driving off with it.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.000
And then jumped to conclusions.

15:04.000 --> 15:04.760
And then jumped to conclusions.

15:04.800 --> 15:08.400
Jumped to conclusions?
Yep.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.880
Sir, please can I have
your driver's licence.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.240
What are you doing in Romania?

15:25.280 --> 15:27.800
Business.
What business?

15:27.840 --> 15:28.000
My business.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.520
My business.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.680
Sir, step out
of the car for me, please.

15:36.920 --> 15:40.160
Encrypted payments?

15:49.400 --> 15:52.000
How do you get by?
We manage.

15:52.000 --> 15:52.080
How do you get by?
We manage.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.280
Sir?
Blackbird?

15:58.360 --> 16:00.000
Out of the car, now!

16:00.000 --> 16:00.760
Out of the car, now!

16:05.040 --> 16:06.960
Stop! Stop! Stop!

16:14.800 --> 16:16.000
We can't make a deal with him.
Of course, we can.

16:16.000 --> 16:16.880
We can't make a deal with him.
Of course, we can.

16:16.920 --> 16:20.160
After everything he's done?
Archie, I don't need to remind you

16:20.200 --> 16:22.840
of the awesome power
that our organisation wields

16:22.880 --> 16:24.000
or of the consequences of
that power if it's corrupted.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.400
or of the consequences of
that power if it's corrupted.

16:25.440 --> 16:28.120
We have the man that corrupted that
power. He's locked in that room.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.480
Well now, apparently,
there's another one who's not.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.000
He's bluffing.
We don't know that.

16:32.000 --> 16:32.520
He's bluffing.
We don't know that.

16:34.280 --> 16:37.520
It's George. Find out
where he is and get him back here.

16:39.600 --> 16:40.000
Where the hell are you?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.680
Where the hell are you?

16:41.720 --> 16:44.600
I don't want you to panic but...
Where are you?

16:44.640 --> 16:48.000
Romania.

16:48.000 --> 16:48.040
Romania.

16:49.840 --> 16:53.000
What are you doing in Romania?
Um, pursuing a lead.

16:53.040 --> 16:56.000
Listen, Archie, it's Shiv.

16:56.000 --> 16:56.040
Listen, Archie, it's Shiv.

16:56.080 --> 16:59.160
I think he's got himself into
trouble. Why do you think that?

16:59.200 --> 17:01.640
Remember that time
me and him went to visit Rebrov?

17:01.680 --> 17:04.000
Well, he was really drunk
and he kept on talking about

17:04.000 --> 17:04.320
Well, he was really drunk
and he kept on talking about

17:04.360 --> 17:06.760
not living with regrets
and how he'd got himself

17:06.800 --> 17:08.720
into something he
couldn't get out of.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.000
Anyway, he kept mentioning
Blackbird. Blackbird?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.840
Anyway, he kept mentioning
Blackbird. Blackbird?

17:17.320 --> 17:19.480
Yeah, and I just ran it

17:19.520 --> 17:20.000
as a keyword search
through his bank account.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.560
as a keyword search
through his bank account.

17:24.400 --> 17:26.320
Are you in a car chase?
No.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
George? No, I'm not in a fucking
car chase! Just listen!

17:28.000 --> 17:29.880
George? No, I'm not in a fucking
car chase! Just listen!

17:29.920 --> 17:32.920
The search brought payments to
an encrypted source and it's...

17:32.960 --> 17:35.440
..it's Janet.

17:35.480 --> 17:36.000
He's been sending money to her.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.440
He's been sending money to her.

17:37.480 --> 17:40.520
Rebrov's Janet?
Yeah, they're still in contact.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.800
But if you need it verified,
get Ryan or someone to

17:43.840 --> 17:44.000
bring up the payments.
It's all in there. Ryan's dead.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.160
bring up the payments.
It's all in there. Ryan's dead.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.360
What? Ryan's dead.
Rebrov killed him. Jesus.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.520
Where's Shiv now?

17:57.160 --> 18:00.000
He gave me the slip.
I'm trying to catch up with him.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
He gave me the slip.
I'm trying to catch up with him.

18:01.040 --> 18:03.520
George, if you had suspicions,
you should've come to me first.

18:03.560 --> 18:06.600
You don't just go out into the field
on your own. Yeah, I know, I know.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.000
Just... What if I've got this wrong?
You almost certainly are wrong.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Just... What if I've got this wrong?
You almost certainly are wrong.

18:10.040 --> 18:13.760
Just don't do anything stupid. And
don't approach Shiv if you see him.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.000
I'm gonna call you back.
Yeah, OK.

18:35.800 --> 18:39.520
George is in Romania.
He went there after... Shiv.

18:40.600 --> 18:44.320
Rebrov says Shiv's the mole.
Shiv would never betray The Lazarus.

18:44.360 --> 18:47.320
I used to say that about Rebrov.
Wes, I know Shiv better than anyone.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.000
He wouldn't do this.
I don't care what you feel

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
He wouldn't do this.
I don't care what you feel

18:50.040 --> 18:52.040
or what you think,
I care about facts.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.240
I want data.
Is George still trailing him?

18:54.280 --> 18:56.000
He lost him. Well, tell him
to find him again, quickly.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.160
He lost him. Well, tell him
to find him again, quickly.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.520
If we're being betrayed,
I'd rather know about it now

19:00.560 --> 19:04.000
than further down the line when I've
got a gun in my back. Yes, ma'am.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.080
Shiv's a mole?

19:25.480 --> 19:28.000
Always the ones
you least expect, isn't it?

19:28.000 --> 19:28.640
Always the ones
you least expect, isn't it?

19:28.680 --> 19:30.480
No, it's always the ones
you most expect.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.760
This is real life, not an
Agatha fucking Christie story.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.720
He never got over it, you know.

19:35.760 --> 19:36.000
What happened with me and Janet.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.160
What happened with me and Janet.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.480
Our lad.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.000
It's eaten away at me but what
do you think it's done to him?

19:44.000 --> 19:44.920
It's eaten away at me but what
do you think it's done to him?

19:44.960 --> 19:48.040
I know Shiv better than anyone.

19:48.080 --> 19:51.400
I'm gonna find out what's really
going on here. You do that.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.000
You find out what's
really going on here.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.640
You find out what's
really going on here.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.080
Start scratching
at the surface, Archie.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.120
It's taken you long enough.

20:09.360 --> 20:12.080
So, only special people are aware
when time jumps backwards?

20:12.120 --> 20:14.880
Yes.
And you're one of them?

20:14.920 --> 20:16.000
Yes.
But I'm not.

20:16.000 --> 20:16.920
Yes.
But I'm not.

20:17.920 --> 20:19.760
Not yet.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.760
It's all really
just a matter of perception.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.520
Most people's brains
can't process the time jump,

20:26.560 --> 20:28.760
so they reject the memories
of the time they've lost.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.320
A small dose of this
will open up your mind

20:31.360 --> 20:32.000
just enough to jolt the
misplaced memories to the surface.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.280
just enough to jolt the
misplaced memories to the surface.

20:36.360 --> 20:40.000
I can show you all the time you've
lived and forgotten, if you want.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.400
I can show you all the time you've
lived and forgotten, if you want.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.680
Why wouldn't I want that?
It can get messy.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.720
I can do messy.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.000
I've no doubt.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.400
I've no doubt.

20:50.400 --> 20:54.600
You're 23. In your lifetime,
we've re-set 15 times,

20:54.640 --> 20:56.000
undoing a combined total of roughly
98 months, about eight years.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.200
undoing a combined total of roughly
98 months, about eight years.

20:58.240 --> 21:01.560
That's a lot of experiences. You
do this and you're going to start

21:01.600 --> 21:04.000
remembering things from those years.
Sometimes it'll drip feed

21:04.000 --> 21:04.680
remembering things from those years.
Sometimes it'll drip feed

21:04.720 --> 21:08.200
but more often they'll come all
at once. We call this the wave.

21:08.240 --> 21:11.760
The wave? Like a wave hello
to your old memories?

21:11.800 --> 21:12.000
Like a sensory tsunami
hitting your brain

21:12.000 --> 21:14.800
Like a sensory tsunami
hitting your brain

21:14.840 --> 21:18.000
with experiences and emotions
you have no idea you'd had.

21:18.040 --> 21:20.000
That doesn't sound good.
Well, it really depends

21:20.000 --> 21:20.480
That doesn't sound good.
Well, it really depends

21:20.520 --> 21:22.960
on what happened to you in
the time that got wiped away.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.200
Archie,

21:26.240 --> 21:28.000
it's going to be disorientating.

21:28.000 --> 21:28.920
it's going to be disorientating.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.880
Your mind is going to try and
cope with a huge influx of data

21:31.920 --> 21:35.480
that, frankly, we're not genetically
programmed to be able to understand.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.760
It's gonna feel like
you're lucid dreaming.

21:40.080 --> 21:42.080
Like you just took acid
and got the world's worst

21:42.120 --> 21:44.000
deja vu at the same time.

21:44.000 --> 21:44.200
deja vu at the same time.

21:44.240 --> 21:47.200
I mean, you know, for the record,

21:47.240 --> 21:50.560
that I still don't believe
any of this is true, don't you?

21:50.600 --> 21:52.000
Hmm! I do.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.040
Hmm! I do.

22:18.360 --> 22:19.880
Oh!

22:32.880 --> 22:35.160
Ugh!

22:45.240 --> 22:47.320
Don't move!

22:49.400 --> 22:51.400
All right, all right, all right!

22:51.440 --> 22:53.920
Can I just...?

22:53.960 --> 22:55.760
Yeah?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.040
Oh!

23:14.080 --> 23:15.560
Argh!

23:19.400 --> 23:20.000
Oh! Oh, fuck!

23:20.000 --> 23:21.720
Oh! Oh, fuck!

23:21.760 --> 23:23.800
Oh! Oh!

23:33.480 --> 23:36.000
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

23:36.000 --> 23:36.400
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

23:49.400 --> 23:51.400
You really think
it's true about Shiv?

23:51.440 --> 23:52.000
That he's a mole?
Of course he's not.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.720
That he's a mole?
Of course he's not.

23:53.760 --> 23:57.360
Until we have undeniable proof,
every eventuality is on the table.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.880
He's Pavlov's mole.
What?

23:59.920 --> 24:00.000
Pavlov was this guy who had
a dog in a box with a cyanide pill.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.280
Pavlov was this guy who had
a dog in a box with a cyanide pill.

24:03.320 --> 24:05.400
He reasoned the dog could
either be alive or dead

24:05.440 --> 24:07.440
but until he opened the box
to check he didn't know.

24:07.480 --> 24:08.000
So, arguably, the dog
was both alive and dead.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.760
So, arguably, the dog
was both alive and dead.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.960
That's Pavlov's dog. But, in this
case, Pavlov's mole because...

24:14.720 --> 24:16.000
..Shiv might be a mole.

24:16.000 --> 24:16.720
..Shiv might be a mole.

24:16.760 --> 24:19.000
That's Schrodinger's Cat,
you dumb idiot.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.480
Schrodinger had a cat in a box.
Pavlov's the guy who rang a bell

24:21.520 --> 24:24.000
every time he fed his dog.
What the hell are you talking about?

24:24.000 --> 24:24.480
every time he fed his dog.
What the hell are you talking about?

24:24.520 --> 24:26.800
Oh, whatever it is,
please God make it stop.

24:26.840 --> 24:30.160
I don't care what anyone says,
Shiv would never betray us.

25:26.280 --> 25:27.840
Romania.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.760
Got you.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.760
Fuck's sake.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.600
Argh! Oh!

27:34.640 --> 27:36.000
Ugh! Ugh! Get off!

27:36.000 --> 27:37.400
Ugh! Ugh! Get off!

27:49.720 --> 27:51.760
Uugghh!

27:54.080 --> 27:55.880
Argh!

27:55.920 --> 27:57.320
Ugh!

27:57.360 --> 28:00.000
Uugghh! Argh!

28:00.000 --> 28:02.560
Uugghh! Argh!

28:02.600 --> 28:06.560
Oh! You fucking dickhead.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.560
Ugh! Ugh! Stop! Stop!

28:12.600 --> 28:15.760
Ugh! Ugh!

28:21.200 --> 28:23.920
Yeah, you know what that is,
yeah, that dizziness?

28:24.920 --> 28:27.400
That's concussion, mate.
Ugh!

28:27.440 --> 28:29.440
Who are you?

28:31.920 --> 28:32.000
Here to see a man about a bomb.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.920
Here to see a man about a bomb.

28:35.360 --> 28:38.160
Ugh! You're The Lost Glory?

28:38.200 --> 28:40.000
What's fucking left of them.

28:40.000 --> 28:40.320
What's fucking left of them.

28:46.360 --> 28:48.000
Shit!

28:48.000 --> 28:48.360
Shit!

29:51.720 --> 29:52.000
Archie? Archie?

29:52.000 --> 29:53.040
Archie? Archie?

30:02.040 --> 30:04.560
I can show you all the time
you've lived and forgotten.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.000
There has been an attack on Iraq.

30:08.000 --> 30:08.840
There has been an attack on Iraq.

30:10.480 --> 30:13.480
The simplest of things
make the biggest difference.

30:18.440 --> 30:22.080
Out of the way, mate!

30:22.120 --> 30:24.000
Get out the way! Move!
Who knows, maybe the very act

30:24.000 --> 30:24.120
Get out the way! Move!
Who knows, maybe the very act

30:24.160 --> 30:26.520
of me eating that burrito
might change the world.

30:45.640 --> 30:47.640
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Shiv.

30:47.680 --> 30:48.000
What do you want? I came to tell
you you're getting pulled out.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.720
What do you want? I came to tell
you you're getting pulled out.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.760
We need Cunningham
to stay where he is.

30:52.800 --> 30:55.920
No. Cunningham's got links to
organised crime throughout Europe

30:55.960 --> 30:56.000
and the Middle East. He's involved
in the smuggling of drugs,

30:56.000 --> 30:58.440
and the Middle East. He's involved
in the smuggling of drugs,

30:58.480 --> 31:00.840
weapons and people.
And today, he leaned across me

31:00.880 --> 31:03.800
and blew a man's brains out and
you want me to back off him? Yes.

31:03.840 --> 31:04.000
Why?
I can't tell you.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.560
Why?
I can't tell you.

31:08.520 --> 31:10.200
12 months' work down the drain.

31:11.240 --> 31:12.000
A murderer going free
and you're out of tea bags.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.920
A murderer going free
and you're out of tea bags.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.600
Do you always bring a thermos
when you break into someone's house?

31:18.640 --> 31:20.000
That's a bad night.

31:20.000 --> 31:20.920
That's a bad night.

31:23.560 --> 31:26.400
Can you leave my flat, please?
Of course.

31:26.440 --> 31:28.000
This visit is a courtesy,
you understand.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.640
This visit is a courtesy,
you understand.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.720
We're not asking, we're telling.

31:36.880 --> 31:40.600
Hey, look who's back.
Whoa! George Cunningham,

31:40.640 --> 31:43.800
you're under arrest for murder,
extortion, terror offences.

31:43.840 --> 31:44.000
You fucking grass!
Read the room, Gary.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.280
You fucking grass!
Read the room, Gary.

31:47.320 --> 31:49.200
I'm not messing about here,
gentlemen.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.400
You're fired.
There may be further punishments...

31:51.440 --> 31:52.000
Archie.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.400
Archie.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.240
It was the guy in the burrito truck
that did it for you, wasn't it?

31:58.800 --> 32:00.000
Just out of interest, if you
could go back and keep your job...

32:00.000 --> 32:02.520
Just out of interest, if you
could go back and keep your job...

32:02.560 --> 32:04.600
I'd do the same thing again.

32:04.640 --> 32:07.440
OK. That's good to know.

32:31.760 --> 32:32.000
..businessman believed to have
been involved with organised crime

32:32.000 --> 32:34.560
..businessman believed to have
been involved with organised crime

32:34.600 --> 32:37.240
was killed
in a shoot-out last night.

32:37.280 --> 32:40.000
George Edward Cunningham,
47, from Lewisham,

32:40.040 --> 32:43.520
was returning home when two men
fired on him with a shotgun.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.280
Police are assuming that
the murder was gang related

32:46.320 --> 32:48.000
due to Cunningham's supposed links
to several prominent

32:48.000 --> 32:49.480
due to Cunningham's supposed links
to several prominent

32:49.520 --> 32:52.480
organised crime groups.
The investigation is ongoing

32:52.520 --> 32:54.520
and no arrests have been made.

32:54.560 --> 32:56.000
Any witnesses or members of the
public who may have more information

32:56.000 --> 32:57.840
Any witnesses or members of the
public who may have more information

32:57.880 --> 33:00.600
are urged to come forward.
That's it for the news

33:00.640 --> 33:03.640
and now on to the weather.
We're expecting...

33:33.440 --> 33:35.440
Who are you?

33:36.960 --> 33:38.960
I'm the caretaker.

33:40.240 --> 33:42.240
Of the bomb?

33:42.280 --> 33:44.000
No, this shitty farmhouse!

33:44.000 --> 33:44.280
No, this shitty farmhouse!

33:45.280 --> 33:47.280
Yes, of the bomb.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.440
Why did you attack me?

33:50.480 --> 33:52.000
I thought you were an intruder.
No, I'm from The Lost Glory.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.400
I thought you were an intruder.
No, I'm from The Lost Glory.

33:55.120 --> 33:58.000
Well, we arranged to pick up
Big Boy from you, didn't we?

33:58.040 --> 34:00.000
Yeah, I just didn't think you
were from The Glory. Why not?

34:00.000 --> 34:02.160
Yeah, I just didn't think you
were from The Glory. Why not?

34:02.200 --> 34:06.480
Well, as I understand it, one of
The Lost Glory's founding principles

34:06.520 --> 34:08.000
is the reinstatement of a white
ethno-nationalist government

34:08.000 --> 34:10.560
is the reinstatement of a white
ethno-nationalist government

34:10.600 --> 34:12.600
and a pure Aryan state.

34:13.600 --> 34:16.000
Yeah, we dropped all that.
Yeah? Yeah.

34:16.000 --> 34:16.800
Yeah, we dropped all that.
Yeah? Yeah.

34:16.840 --> 34:19.680
It was an old idea.
We're more inclusive now.

34:21.440 --> 34:24.000
Oh, good for you.

34:24.000 --> 34:24.480
Oh, good for you.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.680
What's your name?
Rudy.

34:27.680 --> 34:29.600
I'm George.

34:31.480 --> 34:32.000
So, do you have the detonator?

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
So, do you have the detonator?

34:34.040 --> 34:36.040
Uh-huh.

34:36.080 --> 34:38.080
Show me.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.000
Show me the bomb.
The bomb is ten miles away.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.520
Show me the bomb.
The bomb is ten miles away.

34:42.560 --> 34:45.280
I've got a car.

34:46.160 --> 34:48.000
We're gonna
have to trust each other.

34:48.000 --> 34:48.840
We're gonna
have to trust each other.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.400
Of course.

35:04.040 --> 35:06.040
So, where's the money?

35:06.080 --> 35:08.240
The what?
The rest of the money.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.480
You only wired half.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.000
I have assurances The Lost Glory
always pays their way.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.960
I have assurances The Lost Glory
always pays their way.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.440
We told you we'd give you the other
half once you showed us the bomb.

35:22.760 --> 35:26.840
Hm! Of course. As discussed.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.600
As discussed.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.600
So, would you like to see it?

35:34.680 --> 35:36.000
I didn't come all this way not to.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.880
I didn't come all this way not to.

37:32.520 --> 37:34.520
I already ate.

37:34.560 --> 37:36.000
It's a symbolic burrito.
Uh-huh!

37:36.000 --> 37:37.400
It's a symbolic burrito.
Uh-huh!

37:37.440 --> 37:40.040
All right, I'll have it if you
really don't want it. I'll have it.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.000
How was the wave?
Enlightening.

37:44.000 --> 37:44.880
How was the wave?
Enlightening.

37:48.400 --> 37:52.000
Cunningham's dead.
Doesn't that mess with your plan?

37:52.000 --> 37:52.760
Cunningham's dead.
Doesn't that mess with your plan?

37:52.800 --> 37:56.200
I said I needed him out of jail,
I didn't say I needed him alive.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.880
Shiv.
I didn't have him killed.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.000
Don't lie to me.
Have I lied to you so far?

38:00.000 --> 38:02.760
Don't lie to me.
Have I lied to you so far?

38:04.160 --> 38:06.760
No. But that doesn't mean you won't.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.000
No. It doesn't mean I won't.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.520
No. It doesn't mean I won't.

40:07.040 --> 40:08.000
Wow!

40:08.000 --> 40:09.040
Wow!

40:09.080 --> 40:11.400
What do you think?

40:12.400 --> 40:14.680
That's a big bomb

40:14.720 --> 40:16.000
Ha! Yes, it is.

40:16.000 --> 40:16.760
Ha! Yes, it is.

40:16.800 --> 40:19.880
Like in the movies.

40:19.920 --> 40:23.240
Yep. Movies about people
with big fucking bombs.

40:26.320 --> 40:29.720
And you have the detonator?
Yeah, yeah. I got it.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.000
So, this is mine? I, er, I mean,

40:32.000 --> 40:33.560
So, this is mine? I, er, I mean,

40:33.600 --> 40:37.400
The Lost Glory's, we own this now?
Yes.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.760
I wanna blow it up.

40:39.800 --> 40:40.000
Excuse me? Like, as soon as
possible, I wanna blow it up.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.520
Excuse me? Like, as soon as
possible, I wanna blow it up.

40:43.560 --> 40:47.160
Now?
Tonight, yeah.

40:48.520 --> 40:51.600
Look, man, what you choose
to do with it is your business.

40:51.640 --> 40:53.920
I'm just the caretaker.

40:54.960 --> 40:56.000
But, you know, you blow it up here,
you're just gonna

40:56.000 --> 40:57.040
But, you know, you blow it up here,
you're just gonna

40:57.080 --> 40:59.280
vaporise a lot of cows
and dairy farmers.

41:00.320 --> 41:04.000
Right.
Just, you know, seems like a waste.

41:04.000 --> 41:04.120
Right.
Just, you know, seems like a waste.

41:04.160 --> 41:08.120
No, I mean, you're right.

41:08.160 --> 41:10.360
Let's move it.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.000
Where?
Ruthenia.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.080
Where?
Ruthenia.

41:14.120 --> 41:17.000
Look, can you help
me get it across the border?

41:17.040 --> 41:19.600
Yeah, I can help you transport it

41:19.640 --> 41:20.000
and then take you
to the detonation site.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.920
and then take you
to the detonation site.

41:21.960 --> 41:26.600
What's the detonation site? It's
any site outside the blast radius

41:26.640 --> 41:28.000
of this giant fucking bomb
you're gonna set off.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.080
of this giant fucking bomb
you're gonna set off.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.680
OK.

41:37.360 --> 41:39.680
OK, let's go.
