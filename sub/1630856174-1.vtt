That yours?

24:49.541 --> 24:54.041
Sergeant Joe Marks, jump in.
I'll run you back to the mess.

25:03.583 --> 25:06.125
- Thank you. It's good to be in the warm.
- I expect it is.

25:20.708 --> 25:22.000
Flying Officer, Freddie Hook.

25:23.041 --> 25:25.458
- That was close.
- You were lucky in this fog.

25:26.041 --> 25:30.500
Yeah. My radio and electrics
failed out of the North Sea.

25:32.208 --> 25:34.041
I was guided in by another aircraft.

25:34.375 --> 25:36.916
- Surprised you managed to find the place.
- What do you mean?

25:37.208 --> 25:39.666
We're not an operational station,
haven't been for years.

25:40.875 --> 25:42.500
We're just a storage depot now.

25:44.791 --> 25:48.541
- So this isn't RAF Miriam St. George?
- That's another ten miles away, sir.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.458
- This is RAF Minton.
- Minton?

25:52.250 --> 25:53.458
I've never heard of it.

25:59.166 --> 26:01.708
I saw your runway lights...

26:03.541 --> 26:08.958
and... Well, looks like I've plonked
my Vampire down onto the wrong airfield.

26:11.541 --> 26:13.666
- Sorry.
- Don't mention it, sir.

26:46.083 --> 26:47.125
You got the short straw,

26:47.250 --> 26:49.083
having to spend your Christmas
on duty here?

26:49.416 --> 26:51.416
Yes.

26:52.708 --> 26:53.791
Let's get you settled.

27:09.250 --> 27:11.833
- This will warm you up, sir.
- Thank you.

27:18.333 --> 27:19.708
Come on, Lizzie.

27:28.625 --> 27:31.916
<i>Come on, Lizzie. Pick up.</i>

28:25.583 --> 28:28.333
- Did you get through?
- Strange.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.916
Well, it is Christmas.

28:41.583 --> 28:42.958
You've been here long, Joe?

28:43.625 --> 28:46.500
Since the beginning of the war
when the station opened.

28:47.583 --> 28:49.458
- It's different then.
- Hmm.

28:49.750 --> 28:53.458
Back then, it was full of young pilots
flying mission after mission,

28:54.083 --> 28:56.291
even after their nerves were in shreds.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.708
- Did you have family in the Force, sir?
- Yeah. Yeah, my father.

29:04.291 --> 29:07.166
- I'm sorry.
- Missing in action over Germany.

29:08.500 --> 29:13.166
- So you followed him into the Force?
- Yeah, yeah, I did.

29:14.500 --> 29:16.750
Not right away, though. National Service.

29:17.541 --> 29:20.125
Well, thank God there's no war on.

29:21.750 --> 29:24.625
Let's hope we don't have to go through
anything like that again.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.916
- May I, sir?
- Thank you.

29:49.833 --> 29:51.208
Who's the pilot, Joe?

29:53.916 --> 29:55.500
Oh, that's Mr. John Kavanagh.

29:56.166 --> 29:58.791
- He was here during the war, sir.
- Kavanagh?

29:59.458 --> 30:00.458
Yes.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.916
Often used to sit at that table
where you were sitting.

30:04.666 --> 30:05.833
A Canadian pilot.

30:07.208 --> 30:11.291
- What squadron was that, Joe?
- Pathfinders. Mosquitoes they flew.

30:11.291 --> 30:14.041
I believe Mr. Kavanagh
was the best of them all.

30:14.291 --> 30:17.916
But then, I'm biased.
I was his batman.

30:27.375 --> 30:30.333
- Johnny Kavanagh.
- When the squadron returned

30:30.458 --> 30:33.625
after dropping marker flares
over targets in Germany,

30:33.833 --> 30:38.416
he'd have his Mosquito refueled.
Take off again. Alone.

30:38.750 --> 30:40.958
- He used to guide them back here.
- Yes.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.750
He used to go out over the North Sea...

30:45.000 --> 30:48.875
looking for a crippled plane,
sometimes in fog so dense

30:49.791 --> 30:51.291
you couldn't see your hand.

30:52.541 --> 30:53.791
Just like tonight.

31:03.333 --> 31:04.875
Well, he brought me home tonight.

31:05.833 --> 31:07.250
Oh, I don't think so, sir.

31:09.958 --> 31:14.291
Mr. Johnny went out
on his last patrol Christmas Eve, 1943.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.791
Just 14 years ago tonight.

31:19.875 --> 31:21.083
He never came back.

31:22.958 --> 31:24.333
He went down with his plane...

31:26.625 --> 31:28.833
somewhere out there over the North Sea.

31:37.500 --> 31:38.625
Well, good night, sir.

31:43.375 --> 31:47.125
Oh, and uh...
...Happy Christmas.

32:44.083 --> 32:47.375
We saw you on the radar
looked like you were heading for Miriam.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.958
- Then you just vanished.
- We lost you around about here.

32:52.791 --> 32:54.541
- Why did you...
- I was led down.

32:55.750 --> 32:58.708
Old guy here turned on the runway lights
and saved my life.

33:01.291 --> 33:03.916
This place shut down years ago
at the end of the war.

33:04.625 --> 33:06.375
Uh, it's been abandoned ever since.

33:24.958 --> 33:25.958
Come on.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.333
Let's get you back to civilization, sir.

33:30.250 --> 33:31.458
Home for Christmas.

33:57.958 --> 33:59.750
<i>Crocodile Lima, Monkey Delta.</i>

33:59.750 --> 34:02.500
<i>Can you read me?
Do you require assistance?</i>

34:03.000 --> 34:05.916
<i>Monkey, Delta,
Crocodile Lima, Skipper here.</i>

34:06.083 --> 34:08.750
<i>Flank damage and hit
from pursuing enemy fighter.</i>

34:08.916 --> 34:12.500
<i>Instrument failure.
Require ground assisted approach.</i>

34:13.083 --> 34:15.208
<i>Crocodile Lima, Monkey Delta,</i>

34:15.416 --> 34:18.416
<i>it's time to follow me down.
I'm taking you home.</i>
