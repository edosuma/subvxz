20:28.686 --> 20:30.563
It's<i> Cape Fear.</i>

20:31.939 --> 20:33.482
Hide. Hide under the desk.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.194
Ow.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.194
Ow!

20:36.194 --> 20:38.196
Move over.

20:36.194 --> 20:38.196
Get off of me!

20:38.196 --> 20:39.613
I have no room.

20:38.196 --> 20:39.613
I was here.

GEORGE:

20:39.613 --> 20:41.115
My foot's sticking out.

ELAINE:

20:41.115 --> 20:42.449
Shut up. He's coming.

20:42.449 --> 20:43.492
Shh, shh, shh.

21:00.218 --> 21:01.844
Is that cashmere?

21:01.844 --> 21:04.597
GEORGE:

21:01.844 --> 21:04.597
Of course it's cashmere.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.103
What's this?

21:14.190 --> 21:15.524
But in a way,

21:15.524 --> 21:16.650
I think I inadvertently

21:16.650 --> 21:18.318
turned this guy

21:16.650 --> 21:18.318
into an alcoholic,

21:18.318 --> 21:19.737
and I hate being around

21:18.318 --> 21:19.737
alcoholics

21:19.737 --> 21:21.321
because they're

21:19.737 --> 21:21.321
telling you

21:21.321 --> 21:24.408
how much they love you

21:21.321 --> 21:24.408
or how much they hate you...

21:24.408 --> 21:26.577
and those are the two statements

21:24.408 --> 21:26.577
that scare me the most.

21:26.577 --> 21:27.954
But I think he's okay now

21:27.954 --> 21:30.164
because I don't know

21:27.954 --> 21:30.164
how he feels about me.

21:30.164 --> 21:31.331
He's finally off the wagon.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.209
You mean "on the wagon."

21:33.209 --> 21:34.418
Don't get smart.
