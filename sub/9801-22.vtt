It's game night!

Trivia!
Let's play "trivia".

00:16.675 --> 00:17.808
I dominate trivia.

00:17.876 --> 00:20.878
Oh! Can we play
"Simon Says" this week?

00:20.945 --> 00:23.413
Yes, Simon says
"We play trivia"!

Oh, Private, Private,
where are you?

01:02.919 --> 01:05.286
I don't have the bomb, I just

01:05.354 --> 01:07.555
want to share your hiding space.

[Frightened whimpering]

Hot potato?
Is that what you maniacs call

01:28.075 --> 01:30.143
destroying someone's home?!

01:30.211 --> 01:31.612
No, but in certain parts of

01:31.679 --> 01:36.850
Mongolia, destroying someone's
yurt is called "tepid yam".

01:36.917 --> 01:38.918
I wanted to play trivia!

01:38.986 --> 01:41.521
Leonard, it was a freak
accident.

01:41.589 --> 01:44.957
The odds of your habitat
incurring damage were uh...

01:45.024 --> 01:47.360
Uh what were they again,
Kowalski?

01:47.427 --> 01:48.561
Uh, one in three.

01:48.629 --> 01:50.663
Right.
I think we can all agree that

01:50.731 --> 01:51.897
was a risk worth taking.

01:51.965 --> 01:53.432
Leave me alone.

01:53.500 --> 01:54.433
I'm sure the zoo will have

01:54.501 --> 01:57.202
this hole patched up in no time.
You'll see.

01:57.271 --> 01:59.437
Hmm,
damage is structural.

01:59.505 --> 02:02.240
I must knock down whole habitat.

Start fresh, big job.

02:04.810 --> 02:05.710
Nuts.

02:05.778 --> 02:08.312
I'll have to move the koala
somewhere in the meantime.

02:08.381 --> 02:10.315
Maybe he'll get along
with the kangaroo.

02:10.383 --> 02:12.450
I mean, they're both
from Austria.

02:12.518 --> 02:14.585
You mean Australia, da?

02:14.653 --> 02:16.720
There's a difference?

02:16.788 --> 02:18.188
Leonard and Joey together?

02:18.256 --> 02:19.290
Aye-yi-yi.

02:19.357 --> 02:20.391
I calculate the odds of

02:20.458 --> 02:24.060
Leonard surviving
that scenario at... 100%.

02:24.128 --> 02:25.162

02:25.229 --> 02:27.998
No wait, I was holding it
upside down.

That's zero percent with an
exclamation point.

02:30.867 --> 02:34.270
[Sighing] Somehow I feel this
is partially our fault.

02:34.338 --> 02:36.005
It's entirely our fault!

Let's not point fingers
we don't have, Private.

02:39.276 --> 02:44.880
Anyhoo, we'd better smooth this
over with the hoppy marsupial.

some new--

03:09.671 --> 03:11.339
[Whimpers]

03:11.406 --> 03:13.507

to pull?

That's not even a kangaroo!

03:55.547 --> 03:57.415
Leonard is a koala.

03:57.483 --> 04:00.317
I don't care what he is.
He's not stayin' here!

I throw you out!

bloke's kicked!

04:06.557 --> 04:09.626

04:09.694 --> 04:11.495

divergent sleeping schedules,

an absolute minimal.

See, you'll hardly even know
he's here.

04:19.637 --> 04:21.938
Heck, you can even use him
as a footstool if you want.

04:22.005 --> 04:25.040
Haha! Well maybe this'll
work after all.

something in common.

10:32.921 --> 10:33.855
I call that a win.

10:33.922 --> 10:36.891
Now let's ditch this sewer hole
and have a game night.

10:36.959 --> 10:37.992
Dreamy Date!

10:38.060 --> 10:38.993
Did you know that Dreamy Date

10:39.061 --> 10:42.662
is the 75th most popular board
game ever?

10:42.730 --> 10:44.097
Well you would if you'd played

10:44.165 --> 10:47.467
trivia just
ONE STINKING TIME!

10:47.534 --> 10:50.703
Nice try, Kowalski, but we're
going with Rico's game.

10:50.772 --> 10:52.005
All right!

10:52.073 --> 10:54.574
Sure, it's a lot safer than
the last game we played.

10:54.642 --> 10:56.309
Oh, you mean
Hot Potato!

10:56.377 --> 10:57.643
OTHERS: Ahhh!

10:57.710 --> 10:59.478
I love that game,
heh heh.
