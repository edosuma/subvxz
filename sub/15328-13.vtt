00:03.044 --> 00:05.505
- STEPHANIE: [sighing]
All right.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.257
Uh-oh!

00:07.257 --> 00:09.926
Please be in the meatloaf.
Please be in the meatloaf.

00:09.926 --> 00:12.220
Aha! Yes!

00:12.220 --> 00:14.973
Who says I can't cook?
[laughing]

00:14.973 --> 00:17.684
Wait, was I wearing
a necklace?

00:17.684 --> 00:18.852
Oh!

00:18.852 --> 00:20.311
- Steph, do you mind?

00:20.311 --> 00:22.063
The SATs are tomorrow

00:22.063 --> 00:24.065
and I'm trying to score
my practice test.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.443
Okay, so, if this
is my Math score,

00:26.443 --> 00:29.237
and this is my English,
then my total is...

00:29.237 --> 00:32.365
not good enough!
- [paper ripping]

00:32.365 --> 00:35.118
- [groans]

00:38.580 --> 00:41.958
- So, SATs?
How're you feelin'?

00:41.958 --> 00:43.460
- Why am I even doing this?

00:43.460 --> 00:45.545
- To get into college,
to get into law school,

00:45.545 --> 00:47.422
to be a lawyer.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.090
- Well, whose dumb
idea was that?

00:49.090 --> 00:50.842
- Yours.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.761
- Fine. But once
I'm a lawyer,

00:52.761 --> 00:54.846
I'm tracking down
the evil troll

00:54.846 --> 00:56.389
who invented this test

00:56.389 --> 00:58.516
and suing him for
emotional distress.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.101
Better yet--

01:00.101 --> 01:02.896
I'll kill him and then
get myself off.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.776
Get outta my way.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.613
- Stephanie, yell at James.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.573
He stole a bunch of rocks
from my collection.

01:13.573 --> 01:16.284
- I had some evidence I didn't
want floating to the surface.

01:16.284 --> 01:18.286
- Guys, settle this
yourselves, please?

01:18.286 --> 01:20.413
I have to scrape your sister
off the ceiling.

01:22.874 --> 01:24.459
- You know, technically,

01:24.459 --> 01:26.461
I didn't do anything wrong
taking your rocks.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.588
We've shared a room
for over seven years.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.256
That makes us common law.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.300
Legally speaking,
what's mine is yours,

01:32.300 --> 01:33.968
and what's yours is mine.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.929
- That sounds like
we're married.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.056
- Married? Only that
we share all our stuff,

01:38.056 --> 01:39.682
file joint tax returns,

01:39.682 --> 01:41.768
and slowly come
to resent each other

01:41.768 --> 01:43.686
with each passing day.

01:43.686 --> 01:46.314
- I'm all about a tax break.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.483
Count me in,
common law buddy.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.984
- So, while I'm studying,

01:49.984 --> 01:51.486
you fools better
keep it down--

01:51.486 --> 01:54.447
otherwise,
I'll "defenestrate" you.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.783
- Oh, like you could
throw me out a window!

01:56.783 --> 01:58.910
- How do you know
what "defenestrate" means?

01:58.910 --> 02:01.329
- There's some words
you need to know.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.498
- Did you boys
sort everything out?

02:03.498 --> 02:04.999
- Yes, indeedy.

02:04.999 --> 02:07.126
We talked it over
and clarified our relationship.

02:07.126 --> 02:08.877
Right, Aaron?
- Right.

02:08.877 --> 02:10.505
Are we gonna watch some TV?

02:10.505 --> 02:12.173
- Oh, I was hoping to go play
video games with my friends.

02:12.173 --> 02:16.135
- Again? You never
have time for me!

02:16.135 --> 02:19.347
- Nag! Nag! Nag!

I am so over the SATs!

02:54.048 --> 02:55.592
- Just do what I do
on tests--

02:55.592 --> 02:57.010
mumble randomly
and tell the teacher

02:57.010 --> 02:59.220
there's trouble at home.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.889
- New plan for tonight.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.516
No one talk about this test.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.768
- Hi! Hi! Hi!

03:05.768 --> 03:09.022
There's my test-taker.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.190
I got a lotta stuff
for your SATs.

03:11.190 --> 03:12.859
They're tomorrow,
you know?

03:12.859 --> 03:15.028
- [frustrated groan]

03:15.028 --> 03:16.613
- Sharpened pencils,
unsharpened pencils,

03:16.613 --> 03:18.907
granola bars
and a corkscrew.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.116
- A corkscrew?

03:20.116 --> 03:21.701
- Yeah, I'm nervous for her.

03:21.701 --> 03:25.288
Ooooh. Can't a grandma
take the edge off?

03:25.288 --> 03:27.916
- Steph, since this is
my night to pick dessert,

03:27.916 --> 03:29.000
I want popsicles.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.044
- Hold up--if it's your
night to pick dessert,

03:31.044 --> 03:33.004
then it's "our" night,
remember?

03:33.004 --> 03:34.964
And "we" want cookies.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.884
- What? You used to
love popsicles.

03:37.884 --> 03:41.304
It's like I don't even
know you anymore.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.722
- Sweetie,
it doesn't matter.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.183
I made a pie.

03:45.183 --> 03:48.770
Okay, I bought a pie.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.022
- Hi, guys.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.440
- Oh, Dad, what's wrong?

03:52.440 --> 03:56.152
- A patient, Mr. Kestenberg,
came in for surgery,

03:56.152 --> 03:58.279
and it was a tough one.

03:58.279 --> 04:00.907
- Oh, honey, is he okay?

04:00.907 --> 04:04.160
- Heck, yeah, he is!
I totally saved him!

04:04.160 --> 04:06.579
I've been savin'
everybody today.

04:06.579 --> 04:10.208
It was like malfunctioning
aortic valve--pow!

04:10.208 --> 04:12.585
Congested pump--blamo!

04:12.585 --> 04:17.257
Myocardial infarction--
not today, Death!

04:17.257 --> 04:18.925
- [snaps fingers]

04:18.925 --> 04:20.635
- I asked to do one
transplant blindfolded,

04:20.635 --> 04:23.805
but they wouldn't let me.
[laughing]

04:23.805 --> 04:25.848
- STEPHANIE:
[laughing]

04:25.848 --> 04:27.433
- Now be honest...

04:27.433 --> 04:29.811
how proud are you to
be married to a doctor?

04:29.811 --> 04:31.479
- Very.
And, guess what?

04:31.479 --> 04:34.482
As of today, you can be proud
you're married to a doctor, too.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.150
I hired a marketing expert

04:36.150 --> 04:38.277
and she thinks my party business
isn't getting clients

04:38.277 --> 04:40.405
because my company
name isn't memorable.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.033
Ready the confetti.

04:44.033 --> 04:47.161
- Right, dear, yes.
Totally. Totally.

04:47.161 --> 04:49.080
- This is why,
from here on out,

04:49.080 --> 04:50.999
I will be known as...

04:50.999 --> 04:53.459
The Celebration Doctor.

04:53.459 --> 04:57.714
- Oh, as if you were
a medical professional.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.466
- Dad doesn't like when people
call themselves that.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.801
- It's overused.

05:01.801 --> 05:05.054
That soda isn't
a real doctor.

05:05.054 --> 05:07.473
That shoe insert
isn't a real doctor.

05:07.473 --> 05:11.644
And don't even get me started
on that guy with the headphones.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.105
I went for eight years
to get that title

05:14.105 --> 05:17.442
and I don't like it when it's
cheapened by frivolous junk.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.736
- Uh, junk? Frivolous?

05:19.736 --> 05:22.697
Any other words I should be
putting on my business card?

05:22.697 --> 05:25.324
- Oh, man, I was having
such a nice day.

05:25.324 --> 05:28.661
- Five bucks says Dad gets
himself outta this.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.580
- I'll take that action.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.833
'Cause he's gonna have to pull
his foot outta his mouth

05:33.833 --> 05:37.086
or her foot outta his--
- I am a child!

05:39.213 --> 05:41.883
- Charlie, you get
all huffy on that title

05:41.883 --> 05:44.010
because you're way too
hung up on prestige.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.762
- What's wrong with that?

05:45.762 --> 05:47.847
That's like the best thing
about being a lawyer.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.640
- Gabby, you shouldn't pick

05:49.640 --> 05:52.185
your career because
of the prestige.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.270
You should pick it because
you think it'll be fun.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.230
- Nobody in their
right mind

05:56.230 --> 05:58.316
picks a career
because it's fun.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.942
- I don't see why not,

05:59.942 --> 06:02.153
if you're gonna be doing
it for the rest of your life.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.863
Who wants to be all...

06:03.863 --> 06:06.407
Mrs. Grimaldi,
based on your test results,

06:06.407 --> 06:09.160
I'm prescribing you
three cc's of...

06:09.160 --> 06:11.204
[snoring]

06:11.204 --> 06:12.955
- Better that than...

06:12.955 --> 06:14.999
Help! Help! My husband's
having a seizure!

06:14.999 --> 06:17.919
Somebody call
a party planner.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.545
- Why do you gotta
come at my job?

06:19.545 --> 06:20.880
- Because you came at mine.
[laughing]

06:20.880 --> 06:23.424
Which is, at least,
a real job.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.760
- MAGGIE: Ohhh...

06:25.760 --> 06:27.345
Now we're cookin'.

06:27.345 --> 06:30.348
I'll raise ya five.

06:30.348 --> 06:31.641
- Excuse me?

06:31.641 --> 06:34.060
- Your job is totally
a real job.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.771
You look pretty.

06:36.771 --> 06:39.690
- So, you're saying that
if one of the kids

06:39.690 --> 06:41.734
wanted to be
a party planner,

06:41.734 --> 06:43.361
you'd be okay with that?

06:43.361 --> 06:46.948
- [jabbering]
Yes.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.992
- Look me in the eye
when you lie to me.

06:49.992 --> 06:52.411
- [laughing]
I can't do it!

06:52.411 --> 06:54.872
Party planning is not
a career! I'm sorry!

06:54.872 --> 06:56.749
- MAGGIE:
[smacks counter]

06:56.749 --> 06:58.960
A pleasure doin'
business with ya, James.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.046
- I've got to stop
betting on Dad.

07:02.046 --> 07:04.507
- It is so a career.

07:04.507 --> 07:07.510
The most memorable moments
of a person's life--

07:07.510 --> 07:09.554
proms, birthday parties,
baby showers.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.222
They have to be planned!

07:11.222 --> 07:13.349
- You could have
thrown Mr. Kestenberg

07:13.349 --> 07:14.851
the best party ever,

07:14.851 --> 07:18.104
but he wouldn't be there if
I hadn't repaired his aorta.

07:18.104 --> 07:21.190
- Then I could have
planned his funeral.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.192
- Oh!

07:23.192 --> 07:25.653
Important jobs. Fun jobs.

07:25.653 --> 07:26.946
Why are we fighting
about this?

07:26.946 --> 07:29.740
We each have careers
that we find fulfilling.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.325
That's all that matters.

07:31.325 --> 07:33.494
- You are so right, Dad.
- Thank you.

07:33.494 --> 07:34.787
- I wanna spend my life

07:34.787 --> 07:36.706
doing something
that fulfills me.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.332
I don't wanna be a lawyer.

07:38.332 --> 07:39.709
- What?
- Huh?

07:39.709 --> 07:43.004
- I wanna be a stylist
for celebrities.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.714
- A stylist?

07:44.714 --> 07:47.425
You...you don't
wanna be a stylist.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.135
What's a stylist?

07:49.135 --> 07:51.512
- Remember when I told
you to stop wearing corduroys?

07:51.512 --> 07:54.307
That made me your stylist.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.101
All right, Aaron,
take your backpack upstairs.

07:57.101 --> 08:00.396
James, get your finger
off that pie.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.565
- And, Gabby,
explain yourself.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.942
- I'm going to make money
by dressing celebrities.

08:04.942 --> 08:07.111
It's the perfect
career for me.

08:07.111 --> 08:08.946
- That's not a career.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.573
Maggie, back me up.

08:10.573 --> 08:14.368
- If you become a stylist,
do I get a discount?

08:14.368 --> 08:15.828
- Girl, you know
I got you.

08:15.828 --> 08:20.124
- Then go forth
and accessorize.

08:20.124 --> 08:22.084
- My daughter
is not gonna be

08:22.084 --> 08:24.629
picking out culottes
for a living.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.422
- Culottes? Oh, Dad...

08:28.549 --> 08:30.218
- Dad, you're all
over the place.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.886
You just said that
all that matters

08:31.886 --> 08:34.013
is finding a job
that's fulfilling.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.556
So, why can't
I be a stylist?

08:35.556 --> 08:38.601
- Because I was lying
to make my wife happy.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.354
- I can't believe this!

08:41.354 --> 08:44.232
The monster boat
dies in the end.

08:44.232 --> 08:47.318
- Did you just give away
the ending of my new comic book?

08:47.318 --> 08:48.945
- No, remember,

08:48.945 --> 08:51.197
I just gave away the ending
of "our" new comic book.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.615
- Gimme that!

08:52.615 --> 08:54.825
- CHARLIE: Now, now, stop!
- [comic book rips]

08:54.825 --> 08:56.410
- Baaaahhh!

08:56.410 --> 08:59.288
Sometimes I wonder why we're
even in this relationship!

08:59.288 --> 09:02.875
I bought this with my money,
which I went out and earned,

09:02.875 --> 09:05.711
while you sit around the house
all day eating candy!

09:09.465 --> 09:11.259
- I'm sorry you had
to witness that.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.386
We're workin'
through some stuff.

09:15.429 --> 09:17.265
- Look, Gabby--

09:17.265 --> 09:19.892
- Is smart enough to
decide her own future.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.227
I know it's not
what we thought.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.603
But isn't it her choice?

09:22.603 --> 09:25.898
- They never had choices
before you got here.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.233
- Regardless,
she's a Junior

09:27.233 --> 09:29.777
who's stressed enough
as it is.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.153
- Oh...

09:31.153 --> 09:34.198
I guess we don't have to plan
your whole life right now.

09:34.198 --> 09:35.616
We're talking
about career paths,

09:35.616 --> 09:37.743
and you haven't even
graduated high school.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.746
Let's just focus on getting you
through those SATs tomorrow.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.206
- No worries.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.750
This conversation's really
helped me clarify things.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.335
- How so?

09:46.335 --> 09:48.254
- I'm not taking the SATs.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.006
I'm not going to college.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.136
- Wait! Really?

09:55.136 --> 09:57.513
We're having pie?!

10:00.141 --> 10:01.934
- If Gabby's not
going to college,

10:01.934 --> 10:03.477
I'm not going to
the dentist.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.229
- You're going to your room.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.231
We'll call you
when dinner's ready.

10:07.231 --> 10:09.233
- It won't be ready
for awhile--

10:09.233 --> 10:11.694
unless Stephanie
turns on that oven.

10:13.070 --> 10:17.074
- Really? You were sittin'
on that this whole time?

10:17.074 --> 10:20.036
- Maybe little man should
go to culinary school.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.871
- No, he is going to college.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.914
All my kids are
going to college!

10:23.914 --> 10:25.583
Gabby, come out here!

10:25.583 --> 10:27.460
- GABBY: No, you're
going to yell!

10:27.460 --> 10:30.963
- I am not going to yell!

10:30.963 --> 10:32.256
- For your information,

10:32.256 --> 10:34.008
just because I'm not
going to college,

10:34.008 --> 10:36.093
that doesn't mean
I'm not going to school.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.595
I will be applying to

10:37.595 --> 10:40.097
the Philadelphia Stylist
Academy of Pennsylvania.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.474
- [sighing]

10:41.474 --> 10:42.975
That place with all
the late-night infomercials?

10:42.975 --> 10:44.727
- I love that
little cartoon,

10:44.727 --> 10:47.772
the one that speaks
about second chances.

10:47.772 --> 10:51.233
- Gabby, quit acting dumb
and go to college!

10:51.233 --> 10:53.486
- I thought you were cool
with me being a stylist.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.614
- I am--as long as you learn
how to do it at a real school.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.282
- It is a real school.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.242
It's a one-year
vocational program.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.370
And they don't require
an SAT score to get in.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.038
- Uh, quick question.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.082
When you graduate,
does the processional

11:06.082 --> 11:08.042
walk straight to
the unemployment line,

11:08.042 --> 11:10.127
or is there like
a pizza party first?

11:14.090 --> 11:17.093
- Uh, Aaron, can we
help you with something?

11:17.093 --> 11:19.220
- Yes. Take this.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.679
- Son, what are you doing?

11:20.679 --> 11:22.264
- James says he's
gonna get revenge

11:22.264 --> 11:25.226
for tearing his comic book
by coming up with something big.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.186
I have to hide
all my best stuff.

11:27.186 --> 11:30.689
- I suggest the Caymans.

11:30.689 --> 11:33.401
- Well, this seems to be
a major crisis, so obviously--

11:33.401 --> 11:35.027
- Sit!

11:35.027 --> 11:36.278
We're not done.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.531
- But nobody really
needs college anymore.

11:38.531 --> 11:42.034
We live in a world of YouTube
and self-promotion.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.078
- Yeah, honey,
Gabby's not wrong.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.080
Some people do great
without going to college.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.082
- Stephanie,
I know you like being

11:48.082 --> 11:50.292
the kids' best buddy,
but now is not the time.

11:50.292 --> 11:52.169
- This isn't about
being their buddy.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.712
- Yeah, Dad.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.548
- Girl, he crazy.
- I know. Shoot.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.007
- [palm slap]

11:57.007 --> 12:00.886
- Not everyone needs
a diploma to be successful.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.097
That's just the way
the world works now.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.141
- Oh?

12:05.141 --> 12:07.601
Oh, is that the way
the world works now?

12:07.601 --> 12:11.105
Hmmm...what else did
I miss out there, hm?

12:11.105 --> 12:12.857
Anything else change?

12:12.857 --> 12:15.234
No, everything's
still normal.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.615
- That ain't normal.

12:21.615 --> 12:22.825
- My bed!

12:22.825 --> 12:25.578
I bet this is what
James meant by "big."

12:25.578 --> 12:28.038
- James, get down here!

12:28.038 --> 12:29.915
What is wrong
with that boy?

12:29.915 --> 12:32.293
I just made this bed.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.628
- He's mad because we share
everything now.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.547
- Aaron, how many times

12:36.547 --> 12:38.591
have I told you
boys not to share?

12:38.591 --> 12:41.427
Wait, that doesn't
sound right.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.012
- How's that
meatloaf coming?

12:43.012 --> 12:44.430
I kinda worked up
an appetite.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.348
- James, what were
you thinking

12:46.348 --> 12:48.267
dropping Aaron's
mattress out a window?

12:48.267 --> 12:51.645
- I didn't drop it--
I defenestrated it.

12:51.645 --> 12:54.315
- Whatever you two
are doing, just stop it.

12:54.315 --> 12:58.194
- Good idea. Aaron,
let's have a trial separation.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.237
What's mine is mine
and what's yours is yours.

13:00.237 --> 13:03.115
We get until dinner to
claim anything we shared.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.326
Starting...now!

13:05.326 --> 13:07.077
- Hey!

13:12.333 --> 13:14.043
- Enough jaw jacking.

13:14.043 --> 13:17.087
Gabby, college
is a privilege.

13:17.087 --> 13:19.507
I was the first
in my family to go.

13:19.507 --> 13:23.385
And I had to beg, borrow,
and steal to pay for it

13:23.385 --> 13:25.804
because I knew the value
of that education.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.848
- [laughing]
If education's so valuable,

13:27.848 --> 13:29.850
how come you always
complain about

13:29.850 --> 13:31.894
how much you spent
on my degree?

13:31.894 --> 13:33.521
- It's not a complaint.

13:33.521 --> 13:36.106
I just want you
to feel guilty.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.652
- Mine! Mine!

13:39.652 --> 13:41.529
Mine!

13:44.365 --> 13:48.285
- Oh!
- Mine!

13:48.285 --> 13:50.329
- Don't worry, Dad.

13:50.329 --> 13:54.500
No need to put this up
for me and James--it's mine.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.670
Could you just put
it up for me, though?

13:57.670 --> 14:01.215
- Nice move, but I'm claiming
all the basketballs.

14:01.215 --> 14:04.051
- I did not think
this through.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.803
James!

14:07.555 --> 14:09.682
- Gabby, the thing
about vocational school

14:09.682 --> 14:11.850
is you're left
without options.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.228
It's stupid.
You need a fallback.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.771
- Why? You didn't
have one.

14:15.771 --> 14:18.148
- Doctor was my fallback.
- Hang on.

14:18.148 --> 14:21.610
You were just making
a big stink about "doctor,"

14:21.610 --> 14:23.320
and that was your fallback?

14:23.320 --> 14:26.615
What did you
wanna be? Pope?

14:26.615 --> 14:31.370
- Before I was pre-Med,
I...might have been...

14:31.370 --> 14:33.664
a musical theater major.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.040
- [laughing]

14:35.040 --> 14:37.585
- You were so not
a musical theater major.

14:37.585 --> 14:40.421
You're just saying that to make
me think I need options.

14:40.421 --> 14:43.924
- I'm saying that because I
happen to be a trained baritone.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.551
- Prove it!

14:45.551 --> 14:47.553
- I don't need to prove
anything to you.

14:47.553 --> 14:51.056
I am your father.
- Yeah, he's lying.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.558
- Oh, really?

15:10.492 --> 15:12.953
- That's right. Wow.

15:12.953 --> 15:16.248
I brought the "wow"
for three semesters.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.083
- And then you gave up?

15:18.083 --> 15:20.377
- No, I just realized that this
thing I enjoyed doing at 18,

15:20.377 --> 15:23.797
I didn't enjoy enough at 20
to do for the rest of my life.

15:23.797 --> 15:27.468
Luckily, I was at a school
where I could switch.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.136
That's all I'm saying.
Options.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.805
Look, if you don't get
a job as a stylist,

15:31.805 --> 15:33.307
you're not getting
a job, period.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.060
Every employer out there
wants to see a college diploma.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.020
- It's only a dang
fool that thinks

15:38.020 --> 15:40.022
they can do anything of value
without finishing college.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.149
- And anyone who doesn't
finish is a dang fool.

15:42.149 --> 15:48.030
- And a big, sad failure
to their parents!

15:48.030 --> 15:50.324
- Hey, back off!

15:50.324 --> 15:52.701
I didn't finish
college, okay?

15:52.701 --> 15:54.620
- What do you mean you
didn't finish college?

15:54.620 --> 15:56.288
How could you--

15:56.288 --> 15:58.791
- Oh, wait your turn, child.
She's mine!

15:58.791 --> 16:02.044
- [laughing]
This is so perfect.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.380
- If you didn't graduate
from college,

16:04.380 --> 16:07.675
then whose diploma is that
hangin' up in my hallway?

16:07.675 --> 16:09.051
- Mine...

16:09.051 --> 16:11.470
that I paid
an Art Major to make.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.264
- Oh, you've got some explaining
to do, little girl.

16:14.264 --> 16:15.849
- Fine. After four years,

16:15.849 --> 16:19.144
I was still a few credits
shy of graduating.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.021
I always meant to finish up,

16:21.021 --> 16:23.023
but the longer I waited,
the less important it seemed.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.567
- Well, you told me
your degree was a B.S.

16:25.567 --> 16:29.780
- No, I said my degree is--
- Oh, come on!

16:29.780 --> 16:31.240
Who are you?

16:31.240 --> 16:33.242
- If Steph never
finished college,

16:33.242 --> 16:35.160
then I'm not even starting.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.829
- Do you hear that?

16:36.829 --> 16:39.081
Your life is
the ammunition my kids use

16:39.081 --> 16:41.208
in their war
to disappoint me.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.502
- I paid for you
to finish college

16:43.502 --> 16:45.754
and I want my money back.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.589
And I'm not takin'
your check, either,

16:47.589 --> 16:50.759
'cause you're shady.

16:50.759 --> 16:53.095
- Stephanie!
- Aaron! Aaron, not now.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.139
- But James claimed
our bedroom.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.057
Where am I supposed
to sleep?

16:57.057 --> 16:59.059
- There's a mattress
in the living room.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.103
- Nobody in this family
has something smart to say

17:01.103 --> 17:02.730
except for dumb old Stephanie.

17:02.730 --> 17:06.275
She didn't finish college.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.109
- Mom, let it go.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.486
- And, Dad, you let it go.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.238
I'm not taking the SATs.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.115
- You are and that's final!

17:13.115 --> 17:15.742
- You want my stuff,
James? Fine.

17:15.742 --> 17:17.911
'Cause here's my dinner!

17:17.911 --> 17:20.580

17:23.083 --> 17:26.837

17:26.837 --> 17:30.632
- Oh, this amuses you?
Hm? Drop out? Hm?

17:30.632 --> 17:33.802
- No, but this does.

17:33.802 --> 17:36.263
- [goo splatting]
- Oh!

17:42.394 --> 17:46.273
- You know, all this
food is reminding me

17:46.273 --> 17:52.446
that I paid for a meal plan
for you at that school.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.615
- Mom, don't you dare!

17:54.615 --> 17:57.034
- [gravy splatting]
- [screaming]

17:57.034 --> 18:00.120
- CHARLIE: [laughing]

18:02.456 --> 18:06.418
- Soak it up
with your diploma.

18:06.418 --> 18:10.088
- CHARLIE: [laughing]

18:10.088 --> 18:11.840
Oh, no, no, no!

18:11.840 --> 18:16.178
- ALL: [screaming, shouting]
- [food splatting]

18:27.648 --> 18:30.067
- CHARLIE: Okay!
- STEPHANIE: Okay!

18:30.067 --> 18:33.695
No more.
- CHARLIE: Woo.

18:33.695 --> 18:38.283
- [pie splats]
- OTHERS: [laughing]

18:44.122 --> 18:46.333
- Truce.
- Truce.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.794
Can't we just go back
to being common law?

18:48.794 --> 18:50.546
- Common law?

18:50.546 --> 18:52.506
Aaron, you can't be common law.
You're brothers.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.800
- But James said we were
because we share a room.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.343
- He was messing with you.

18:56.343 --> 18:57.845
Even if you could,

18:57.845 --> 18:59.888
Pennsylvania doesn't recognize
common law relationships.

18:59.888 --> 19:02.641
I did a whole mock trial
about it in school.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.352
I made a football player
cry on the stand.

19:05.352 --> 19:08.188
It was awesome.

19:08.188 --> 19:12.943
- James, I want
all my stuff back!

19:16.697 --> 19:18.866
- Yes, dear.

19:22.411 --> 19:25.539
- Pennsylvania really doesn't
recognize common law?

19:25.539 --> 19:27.749
Oh, I got some
phone calls to make.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.675
- It sounds like you found
being a lawyer pretty fun.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.803
- It doesn't mean I'm ever good
enough to do it for real.

19:39.803 --> 19:41.221
[sighing]
You said it.

19:41.221 --> 19:43.974
SATs, college, law school.

19:43.974 --> 19:47.019
If I mess up any one of those,
then what was the point?

19:47.019 --> 19:49.146
- So is that what tonight
was all about?

19:49.146 --> 19:50.898
You're afraid of failing?

19:50.898 --> 19:52.816
- Of course,
I'm afraid of failing.

19:52.816 --> 19:55.360
But I don't have to be if
I apply to that stylist school.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.447
It's above a bike shop,
for crying out loud.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.741
- Gabby, I'll support
whatever you want to do,

20:00.741 --> 20:05.704
but you shouldn't make
decisions out of fear.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.623
- [heavy sigh]

20:07.623 --> 20:10.876
I have to be at the SATs
by 7:00 tomorrow.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.878
- Then let's get
some food in you.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.589
That's all we have
left is raw meatloaf.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.549
Who wants pizza?

20:17.549 --> 20:20.594
- Oh, sounds like the
Celebration Doctor's buying.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.304
- That's all right, Charlie.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.389
You'll pay later.
