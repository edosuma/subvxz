11:01.786 --> 11:03.662
Are you Henry?

11:06.666 --> 11:08.334
Yes.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.294
A girl named Mary called on the pay phone.

11:10.378 --> 11:13.380
Said she's at her parents'
and you're invited to dinner.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.470
Oh, yeah?

11:28.938 --> 11:30.647
Thank you very much.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.181
You're late, Henry.

17:45.857 --> 17:48.734
I didn't know if you
wanted me to come or not.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.694
Where have you been?

17:57.118 --> 17:59.202
You never come around anymore.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.886
Dinner's almost ready.

18:31.903 --> 18:33.653
Come on in.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.431
Hello there.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.518
Hello.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.606
I'm very pleased to meet you.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.612
Sit down.

19:43.224 --> 19:44.975
It's Henry, isn't it?

19:47.478 --> 19:48.979
Yes.

20:07.582 --> 20:10.083
Mary tells me you're a very nice fellow.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.086
What do you do?

20:14.797 --> 20:16.506
Oh, I'm on vacation now.

20:18.843 --> 20:21.219
What did you do?

20:21.304 --> 20:24.055
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.269
Well, I-I work at Lapelle's factory.

20:30.313 --> 20:31.813
I'm -

20:33.065 --> 20:35.108
I'm a printer.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.694
Hen-Henry's very clever at printing.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.075
Yes, he sounds very clever.

20:54.337 --> 20:56.254
I thought I heard a stranger.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.965
We've got chicken tonight.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.468
Strangest damn things. They're man-made.

21:01.552 --> 21:04.387
Little damn things - smaller than my fist.

21:04.472 --> 21:06.222
They're new!

21:07.808 --> 21:09.309
I'm Bill.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.772
Hello. I'm Henry.

21:13.856 --> 21:16.024
Henry's at Lapelle's factory.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.776
Oh, printing's your business, huh?

21:17.860 --> 21:19.903
Plumbing's mine. Thirty years.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.905
I've seen this neighborhood
change from pastures...

21:21.989 --> 21:23.698
to the hellhole it is now.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.784
I put every damn pipe in this neighborhood.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.494
- Dad!
- Bill!

21:27.578 --> 21:29.371
People think pipes grow in their home.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.331
Well, they sure as hell don't.
Look at my knees!

21:33.084 --> 21:34.542
Look at my knees!

21:34.627 --> 21:36.127
Bill, please.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.297
- Are you hungry?
- Bill.

23:57.311 --> 23:59.479
The-The girls have heard this before...

23:59.563 --> 24:02.315
but 14 years ago...

24:02.399 --> 24:05.318
I had an operation on my arm here.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.737
Doctors said I wouldn't be able to use it.

24:07.822 --> 24:10.115
"Well, what the hell
do they know?" I said.

24:10.199 --> 24:13.076
And I rubbed it
for a half hour every day...

24:13.160 --> 24:15.995
and I got so as I could move it a little.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.998
And then I got so as
I could turn a faucet.

24:19.083 --> 24:23.086
And pretty soon, I had my arm back again.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.755
Now I can't feel a damn thing in it.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.340
All numb.

24:30.427 --> 24:35.390
I-I - I-I'm afraid to cut it, you know?

24:36.475 --> 24:39.769
Mary usually does the carving, but...

24:39.854 --> 24:43.022
maybe tonight you'll do it, Henry.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.401
All right with you?

24:51.699 --> 24:53.199
Of course.

24:56.787 --> 24:58.496
I'd be happy to.

25:05.421 --> 25:08.464
Do I just, uh -

25:08.549 --> 25:10.258
just cut them up like regular chickens?

25:10.342 --> 25:13.011
Sure, just cut 'em up
like regular chickens.

26:08.025 --> 26:10.485
She'll be all right in a minute.

26:11.528 --> 26:14.405
Excuse me.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.609
Well, Henry, what do you know?

26:57.241 --> 26:58.741
Oh, uh -

26:59.827 --> 27:02.161
I don't know much of anything.

27:38.449 --> 27:41.367
Henry, may I speak to you a minute?

27:42.870 --> 27:44.454
Over here.

28:29.666 --> 28:32.460
Did you and Mary have sexual intercourse?

28:35.005 --> 28:37.256
Uh - Why?

28:37.341 --> 28:39.008
Did you?

28:40.969 --> 28:42.887
Why are you asking me this question?

28:42.971 --> 28:45.348
I have a very good reason.

28:45.432 --> 28:47.934
And now I want you to tell me.

28:50.854 --> 28:53.606
Oh, I-I'm very -

28:53.690 --> 28:55.400
I love Mary.

28:55.484 --> 28:59.612
Henry, I asked you if you and Mary
had sexual intercourse.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.949
Well, I don't - I don't think
that's any of your business.

29:03.033 --> 29:04.534
Henry!

29:06.829 --> 29:08.329
I'm sorry.

29:10.541 --> 29:14.919
You're in very bad trouble
if you won't cooperate.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.553
Well, uh, I -

29:26.348 --> 29:27.765
Mary!

29:27.850 --> 29:29.725
Mother!

29:31.854 --> 29:33.354
Answer me!

29:34.398 --> 29:36.023
I'm too nervous.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.609
There's a baby. It's at the hospital.

29:38.694 --> 29:40.194
Mom!

29:40.279 --> 29:42.155
And you're the father.

29:42.239 --> 29:44.157
But that's impossible. It's only been -

29:44.241 --> 29:46.617
Mother,
they're still not sure it is a baby.

29:46.702 --> 29:49.328
It's premature, but there's a baby.

29:49.413 --> 29:51.873
After the two of you are married,
which should be very soon...

29:51.957 --> 29:54.125
you can pick the baby up.

29:59.006 --> 30:00.882
Oh.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.681
Ahh.

30:08.765 --> 30:11.767
Mom, he's got a nosebleed.

30:12.936 --> 30:14.520
Oh.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.940
I'll get ice.

30:23.363 --> 30:26.073
You don't mind, do you, Henry?

30:26.158 --> 30:28.784
I-I mean about getting married.

30:30.454 --> 30:31.871
Oh, no.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.801
This dinner's getting mighty cold.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.447
Was there any mail?

36:44.494 --> 36:45.953
No.

39:57.187 --> 39:59.480
Shut up!

40:03.693 --> 40:05.778
Shut up!

41:13.972 --> 41:16.598
I can't stand it! I'm going home!

41:21.437 --> 41:23.230
What are you talking about?

41:23.314 --> 41:27.025
I can't even sleep. I'm losing my mind.

41:27.110 --> 41:30.404
You're on vacation now.
You can take care of it for a night.

41:32.407 --> 41:34.616
Well, you'll come back tomorrow?

41:35.618 --> 41:38.620
All I need is a decent night's sleep!

41:47.922 --> 41:51.508
Why don't you just stay home?

41:52.802 --> 41:54.803
I'll do what I want to do.

41:56.681 --> 42:00.475
And you better take real good care
of things while I'm gone!

45:27.433 --> 45:29.768
Oh, you are sick.

53:30.165 --> 53:31.833
Move over.

54:07.995 --> 54:09.787
Move - Move over.

54:10.789 --> 54:12.457
Move over!

58:22.082 --> 58:24.542
I locked myself out of my apartment.

58:41.643 --> 58:43.644
And it's so late.

59:44.539 --> 59:46.457
Where's your wife?

59:57.719 --> 01:00:00.721
She must've gone back
to her parents' again.

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:07.520
I'm not sure.

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:05.578
Can I spend the night here?

Hiya, sonny. What do you got there?

01:10:26.139 --> 01:10:27.848
Counter, Paul!

01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:47.154
It's okay.
