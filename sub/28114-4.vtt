12:49.424 --> 12:51.425
They're smoking us out.

12:51.426 --> 12:54.395
Oh, God.

12:54.396 --> 12:55.463
You say something.

12:55.464 --> 12:57.398
<i>- You</i> say something.
- You.

12:57.399 --> 12:59.141
I think it's your turn.

12:59.142 --> 13:01.486
I'm not gonna do it.

13:01.487 --> 13:03.996
Fine. Jesus, I'll say something.

13:03.997 --> 13:06.457
Uh, yeah, Storm?

13:06.458 --> 13:08.292
Can you cut the engine, buddy?

13:08.293 --> 13:09.560
Thank you.

13:11.459 --> 13:12.709
Dude!

13:13.123 --> 13:15.763
Dude, you want to get over here?

13:15.764 --> 13:17.865
Your kid's getting asphyxiated.

13:18.438 --> 13:19.739
Princess, sweetie, you okay?

13:20.607 --> 13:23.103
Oh, she's fine. It's fine.

13:23.104 --> 13:24.906
You good, right?

13:25.659 --> 13:28.396
She's ready to roll.

13:28.397 --> 13:30.665
Why are we not rolling?

13:30.666 --> 13:32.266
Action!

13:32.267 --> 13:33.601
Whoa.

13:44.563 --> 13:46.247
Oh, ow!

13:52.216 --> 13:54.589
- You okay?
- Cut. Cutting.

13:57.222 --> 13:59.571
Let's do one more and
then I'm gonna call it.

14:11.931 --> 14:14.225
Okay, that's lunch!

14:14.226 --> 14:15.459
Half hour.

14:15.460 --> 14:17.129
Tears at sundown.

14:30.012 --> 14:32.486
I know you think you got
to speak up, cookie.

14:33.888 --> 14:35.681
And you got to be a whistle-blower.

14:36.849 --> 14:39.519
But be smart. Don't be stupid.

14:39.520 --> 14:42.478
Someone else will say something.
You hang on to your job.

14:43.524 --> 14:45.463
Although...

14:45.464 --> 14:46.697

Hi.

15:01.430 --> 15:03.024
Can I have a word?

15:05.633 --> 15:07.348
- Of course. What's up?

15:07.349 --> 15:09.470
Is there a producer around here?

Anywhere? Like, oh, anybody who...

15:12.297 --> 15:14.458
Yeah. I'm sorry, I just... I have to say

some things out loud here.

15:16.528 --> 15:19.698
Was that legal, what just happened?

15:19.699 --> 15:22.922
Aren't you supposed to be
protecting everybody a lot?

15:22.923 --> 15:25.336
Like, a lot more than
what just happened?

15:25.337 --> 15:26.830
Uh, hi.

15:26.831 --> 15:28.306
We didn't know any of the actors

15:28.307 --> 15:31.292
- had any, uh, motion sickness issues.
- Who are you?

15:31.293 --> 15:33.041
Well, I'm Tray Gubbins. I'm
the stunt coordinator.

15:33.042 --> 15:34.901
Yeah, see, we've never met.

15:34.902 --> 15:36.664
And I just did a stunt this morning

15:36.665 --> 15:38.420
with two of my fellow actors.

15:38.421 --> 15:40.568
That wasn't a stunt.

15:40.569 --> 15:43.289
Also, I didn't have a safety meeting.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.773
Uh, we had a safety meeting
early this morning.

15:45.774 --> 15:48.446
Yeah, but, see, my call was for 2:00.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.605
So I didn't get a safety meeting,

15:50.606 --> 15:52.430
and I know Donte

15:52.431 --> 15:54.135
didn't get a safety meeting.

15:54.136 --> 15:56.908
And I'm not sure about Princess.

15:56.909 --> 15:59.013
Oh, we're good. We're happy.

16:00.177 --> 16:01.677
I got a baby on the way.

16:02.967 --> 16:04.676
As long as it's coming up,

16:05.133 --> 16:07.493
our department hasn't been
sufficiently notified,

16:07.820 --> 16:11.397
like, for the majority of... the setups.

16:12.699 --> 16:15.756
All of these people are
hardworking people.

16:15.757 --> 16:17.405
They're working their butts off.

16:17.406 --> 16:21.294
And you've got, like, a hundred
people and one toilet.

16:21.295 --> 16:23.905
And this guy gets his own honey bucket.

16:23.906 --> 16:25.596
I don't need my own toilet.

16:25.597 --> 16:27.365
It's DGA standard.

16:27.366 --> 16:28.612
You can have my toilet.

16:29.425 --> 16:31.583
Okay, forget about the toilets.

16:31.584 --> 16:32.896
It's not about the toilets.

16:32.897 --> 16:37.279
The point is, we are making
a multimillion dollar

16:37.280 --> 16:40.661
blockbuster movie, and
everybody's scared.

16:40.662 --> 16:42.597
And nobody's gonna say anything.

16:42.598 --> 16:45.600
And we're all supposed to
be feeling really lucky.

16:45.601 --> 16:48.486
Like, really lucky to
be working with you,

16:49.135 --> 16:50.605
and I don't feel lucky.

16:50.606 --> 16:54.070
I mean, you're nice and
all, but this is a job.

16:54.071 --> 16:56.477
And people aren't being taken care of.

16:56.895 --> 16:58.248
They're being shit on.

17:00.309 --> 17:01.543
So...

17:05.391 --> 17:07.338
Okay, I guess I just...

17:09.817 --> 17:12.277
...had to say something because...

17:13.416 --> 17:16.396
Tell on you guys to each
other or something.

17:16.397 --> 17:18.398
But, uh...

17:18.400 --> 17:21.685
that's all I have to say, so...

17:25.458 --> 17:29.877
I mean... an apology would be a thing?

17:29.878 --> 17:31.329
♪ Sometimes you call... ♪

17:31.330 --> 17:33.913
That would be nice, but no?

17:33.914 --> 17:37.268
No. No. Okay. Thank you.

17:39.338 --> 17:41.578
Um, I just want to say...

17:41.579 --> 17:43.491
you are so brave.

17:43.492 --> 17:45.526
You're like Erin Brockovich brave.

17:45.527 --> 17:47.595
And I know 'cause I
grew up with brothers.

17:47.596 --> 17:49.330
Standing up to guys?

17:49.331 --> 17:51.099
I'm a guys' girl, so...

17:51.894 --> 17:53.551
You're bad at your job.

17:54.337 --> 17:57.658
And I've seen you squid your ink
over every man on this set,

17:57.659 --> 17:59.707
and neutralize all of the women.

18:00.323 --> 18:01.576
<i>I'm</i> a guys' girl.

18:02.229 --> 18:03.494
I'm a girls' girl.

18:03.495 --> 18:05.663
And you know what? I'm a guy, too.

18:05.664 --> 18:07.434
So, I'm wondering, why aren't you, like,

18:07.435 --> 18:08.999
flipping your hair in my face

18:09.000 --> 18:10.601
and giving me arm massages,

18:10.602 --> 18:15.390
and rubbing your leg against
my boner by mistake, hmm?

18:15.954 --> 18:17.908
You're so funny.

18:20.364 --> 18:21.646
Uh-huh.

18:57.717 --> 18:59.551
It's just I don't need
to spend Friday nights

18:59.552 --> 19:01.095
with my married friends and their kids.

19:01.096 --> 19:03.216
No way. What single person would?

19:03.217 --> 19:04.789
I mean, I'm single with kids,

19:04.790 --> 19:06.886
and I don't want to be
around other people's kids.

19:06.887 --> 19:08.643
I don't want to be around my own kids.

19:09.867 --> 19:10.927
My options are limited.

19:10.928 --> 19:13.481
Everyone I know is in a couple,
and by this age, I mean,

19:13.482 --> 19:15.584
every lesbian has done each
other, so, that's fun.

19:15.585 --> 19:17.693
Jesus. Is that true?

19:17.694 --> 19:20.205
We don't get enough credit for
our sexual prolific-ness.

19:20.567 --> 19:21.772
Is that a word?

19:21.773 --> 19:23.608
I don't know.

19:23.609 --> 19:25.477
Do you know how annoyed I
am that I'm not dating?

19:25.478 --> 19:27.011
I'm so bloody annoyed.

19:27.012 --> 19:29.648
Been waiting for the third
wave of singlehood to show up.

19:29.649 --> 19:31.769
I don't know about the waves.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.418
Are they gay waves?

19:33.419 --> 19:35.587
They <i> are</i> gay waves, but
they would absolutely apply

19:35.588 --> 19:37.289
to someone "straight" like you.

19:37.953 --> 19:40.392
Why do you air-quote "straight" at me?

19:42.363 --> 19:45.280
So, the first wave

19:45.281 --> 19:47.282
is all the unavailable married folks.

19:47.283 --> 19:49.323
That's... No. I hate that.

19:49.324 --> 19:52.487
Next, we have the youth,
like 20s. Way young.

19:52.488 --> 19:54.339
Oh, yeah. What do you talk about?

19:54.340 --> 19:56.205
I could never do a youngster.

19:56.206 --> 20:00.228
Agreed. Eh, but, you know, at a party.

20:03.247 --> 20:04.801
Then the third wave comes.

20:04.802 --> 20:06.735
The problem is, you don't
have chemistry right away.

20:06.736 --> 20:07.919
It's a slow burn.

20:07.920 --> 20:10.677
But these are grown people, and
they've got their shit together.

20:10.678 --> 20:13.123
So... you're a third wave.

20:13.124 --> 20:14.775
You just described yourself.

20:14.776 --> 20:16.411
I don't know what I am.

20:16.412 --> 20:18.834
So, what I'm picking up is

20:18.835 --> 20:21.249
that you like the first two waves

20:21.250 --> 20:23.485
because you don't want a commitment.

20:23.486 --> 20:26.110
Commitment... not super attractive.

20:26.111 --> 20:29.274
Is that a "you" thing, or is
that a lesbianicle thing?

20:31.962 --> 20:34.329
I may be guilty of an
attraction to drama.

20:36.225 --> 20:37.749
That may be a "me" thing.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.203
Hmm.

20:40.387 --> 20:42.755
I don't know why I told you that.

20:43.667 --> 20:44.934
It's okay.

20:44.935 --> 20:48.904
It's really... um, interesting
to hear someone...

20:48.905 --> 20:51.313
be so honest about themselves.

20:51.836 --> 20:53.409
You're highly evolved.

20:53.410 --> 20:55.151
Well, thank you.

20:55.637 --> 20:58.115
So, what about yourself?

20:59.095 --> 21:02.574
What's your situation?
Your <i> straight</i> situation?

21:03.352 --> 21:05.543
Oof, ugh...

21:05.544 --> 21:09.414
- You've been burned.
- I don't... Mm.

21:09.415 --> 21:12.359
You're just gonna leave me
flapping in the breeze?

21:12.360 --> 21:13.863
Mm-hmm.

21:17.422 --> 21:19.136
Are you trying to manage me?

21:19.610 --> 21:21.477
Tressa warned me about you.

21:21.810 --> 21:23.261
I don't poach.

21:24.465 --> 21:26.264
She also warned me about...

21:28.363 --> 21:30.685
Your whole...

21:30.686 --> 21:33.521
Not your hole, but your
whole, your whole.

21:33.522 --> 21:35.540
- Oh, she did?
- Mm-hmm.

21:35.541 --> 21:37.342
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.
