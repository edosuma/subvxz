00:01.468 --> 00:03.436
Good evening. I'm standing
inside the entrance

00:03.503 --> 00:05.095
to Fort Owen in
Southern California,

00:05.171 --> 00:07.230
where, in a heavily
guarded stockade,

00:07.307 --> 00:11.038
the most infamous war
criminals in US military
history are confined.

00:11.111 --> 00:13.170
Their names are
already familiar to us:

00:13.246 --> 00:16.215
Colonel John "Hannibal" Smith,
Lieutenant Templeton Peck,

00:16.282 --> 00:20.343
and Sergeant B.A. Baracus,
the legendary A-Team
of the Vietnam War.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.248
Former war heroes
turned popular cult figures,

00:23.323 --> 00:27.282
they were finally captured
after nearly 15 grueling years
as fugitives

00:27.360 --> 00:29.157
running from
their own government.

00:29.229 --> 00:30.662
They've been through a lot.

00:30.730 --> 00:33.358
But now the most
difficult challenge
ever faced by the A-Team

00:33.433 --> 00:34.627
is about to begin.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.726
A military court-martial.

00:36.803 --> 00:40.330
Reporting live from Fort Owen
in southern California,
this is Tiiu Leek.

01:08.201 --> 01:09.634
(GUN FlRlNG)

02:40.360 --> 02:43.261
So, this is where they are.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.229
The A-Team? Yes, sir.

02:46.399 --> 02:48.424
They're in an area below
in the stockade.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.492
But with all due respect,
Major, from what I hear,

02:50.570 --> 02:52.197
it'll be no easy trick
holdin' onto 'em.

02:52.272 --> 02:55.799
From what I hear,
you are absolutely
right, Corporal.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.020
As you were.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.307
Major Laskov, sir.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.347
GENERAL GlLBERT:
Major Laskov, I've heard
some good things about you.

03:35.415 --> 03:37.280
You may stand at ease.

03:37.584 --> 03:41.782
Conviction, conviction,
conviction again.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.047
Your prosecution record's
real impressive, Major.

03:46.125 --> 03:48.650
Everybody in Washington's
talking about you.

03:49.295 --> 03:52.059
I trust we picked
the right man to
handle this case?

03:52.131 --> 03:53.758
I believe you did,
General. Yes.

03:53.833 --> 03:57.132
Convicting the A-Team
is awfully important
to a lot of people.

03:57.203 --> 03:58.431
I understand, sir.

03:58.504 --> 04:01.735
I'm here to see to it that
you really do understand.

04:03.142 --> 04:04.837
Now, Major Laskov,

04:04.911 --> 04:07.812
that these men have
evaded capture and
repeatedly humiliated us

04:07.880 --> 04:09.973
on Capitol Hill
is readily apparent.

04:10.049 --> 04:13.382
But the Joint Chiefs
are far more concerned
about something else.

04:13.453 --> 04:16.718
This so-called
heroic legend

04:16.789 --> 04:19.724
that Smith, Peck, and Baracus
have created for themselves

04:19.791 --> 04:21.555
is a slap in the face
to every man and woman

04:21.628 --> 04:23.789
that honorably served
in Southeast Asia.

04:23.863 --> 04:26.855
Well, hell, the A-Team
is an insult to anybody
who ever wore a uniform.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.628
I couldn't agree
with you more, sir.

04:28.701 --> 04:31.295
And we are fully prepared
to see that justice is served.

04:31.371 --> 04:33.896
Well, would you like me
to show you a list
of everybody else

04:33.973 --> 04:36.601
who thought they were
prepared for the A-Team?

04:37.377 --> 04:42.007
Hannibal Smith is rather adept
at invoking the element
of surprise, Major.

04:42.482 --> 04:45.212
With all due respect, sir,
I don't think Colonel Smith's

04:45.285 --> 04:48.846
unorthodox strategies will be
very effective in the face
of a court-martial.

04:50.189 --> 04:54.523
The A-Team will discover
that the element of surprise
is ours this time.

04:56.963 --> 05:01.923
FACE: And so, after hitting
that crucial home run
in the bottom of the ninth,

05:02.201 --> 05:06.604
we won the orphanage league
softball championship and l...

05:06.673 --> 05:11.042
I suddenly found myself
as somewhat of a celebrity.

05:11.377 --> 05:13.174
Yeah, celebrity,

05:13.246 --> 05:17.080
with all 315 young ladies

05:17.150 --> 05:19.118
at Saint Teresa's.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.446
(SlGHS)

05:21.521 --> 05:23.785
Of course, I was only
13 years old at the time,

05:23.856 --> 05:27.189
but I like to think
of that experience

05:27.260 --> 05:31.720
as when I first discovered
my real calling in life.

05:33.399 --> 05:34.423
Yeah.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.525
Did anyone ever tell you

05:37.203 --> 05:40.434
that you have a very,
very special way with people?

05:41.074 --> 05:43.440
FACE: No. Apparently not.

05:43.976 --> 05:46.001
You're wasting
your time, Face.

05:46.079 --> 05:49.344
These guys all went to
the Decker School of Charm.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.574
Yeah. You might be right.

05:51.951 --> 05:56.285
Still I can't help
but feel, we could've
had so much in common.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.380
Hey, Faceman,

05:57.457 --> 06:00.756
if you don't stop all your
jibber jabber, you're gonna
have my fist in common!

06:00.827 --> 06:02.818
FACE: Don't pay
any attention to him.

06:02.895 --> 06:07.559
He's always this way
during the first few years
of a life sentence.

06:08.267 --> 06:09.393
(CELL DOOR OPENlNG)

06:09.469 --> 06:11.232
Oh, cheer up, guys.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.596
I think I hear room service.

06:16.642 --> 06:20.271
I hope you brought
B.A.'s milk and cookies.
He gets cranky.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.872
Somebody's here
to see you, sir!

06:25.585 --> 06:28.520
CONWAY: Gentlemen,
I've never been one
to mince words,

06:30.022 --> 06:32.718
and I have no intention
of starting now.

06:35.261 --> 06:38.719
The government has had years
to build a case against you.

06:39.465 --> 06:42.263
I don't believe you have
much chance of winning.

06:42.335 --> 06:45.304
Well, winning
isn't everything,
as my daddy used to say.

06:45.371 --> 06:47.771
In a court of law,
it's the only thing,
Colonel Smith.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.832
Wait a minute, what do
you mean, "We don't have
much chance of winning"?

06:50.910 --> 06:53.606
I thought you were a hot-shot
criminal defense lawyer.

06:53.679 --> 06:55.271
Given the overwhelming
evidence,

06:55.348 --> 06:58.283
I'd much rather
be prosecuting than
defending you, Lieutenant.

06:58.351 --> 07:01.650
Unfortunately, that job's
already been taken.

07:01.721 --> 07:03.552
As I told you,
I don't mince words.

07:03.623 --> 07:06.751
No, but your optimism
more than makes up for it.

07:06.859 --> 07:09.885
If you feel that way
about us, why you take
the case in the first place?

07:10.363 --> 07:14.026
I received a letter asking me
to look into the charges,

07:14.100 --> 07:18.696
from a very close friend
of yours, a Frank Santana.

07:20.206 --> 07:22.071
So I made a few phone calls.

07:22.141 --> 07:24.871
That was when I discovered
that the Army had assigned you
a lawyer

07:24.944 --> 07:26.434
with very limited
trial experience.

07:26.512 --> 07:28.639
Clearly, nobody was
going out of his way

07:28.714 --> 07:31.911
to provide you
with the best defense
the military has to offer.

07:31.984 --> 07:34.953
So you volunteered even though
you believe we're guilty?

07:35.021 --> 07:37.387
What I believe is
irrelevant, Colonel.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.015
We didn't commit no crime!

07:39.091 --> 07:40.115
Can you prove that?

07:40.193 --> 07:41.956
B.A. Baracus don't lie!

07:45.598 --> 07:48.692
I'm afraid we're
going to need something
a little more compelling

07:48.768 --> 07:50.736
than your word on this.

07:51.103 --> 07:52.468
Take it easy, B.A.

07:52.538 --> 07:55.029
The prosecution
is prepared to deal.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.406
Plead guilty
on all counts

07:58.478 --> 08:02.244
to charges of robbery,
treason, and desertion,

08:02.315 --> 08:06.445
or face trial on the somewhat
more serious charge of murder,

08:06.519 --> 08:08.009
Colonel Morrison
being the victim.

08:08.087 --> 08:09.384
Some choice.

08:09.622 --> 08:14.525
Especially seeing that
Colonel Morrison died
in an artillery barrage.

08:14.594 --> 08:18.086
Captain Josh Curtis claims
he can place you at the scene.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.961
Curtis is lyin'!

08:20.032 --> 08:22.262
The choice is yours,
gentlemen.

08:22.935 --> 08:25.301
I strongly recommend

08:25.371 --> 08:28.135
you consider
the prosecution's offer.

08:28.207 --> 08:33.042
Prison beats
execution any day.

08:34.580 --> 08:38.346
I'm only sorry I won't be
there to see the joyful tear
in Decker's eye

08:38.417 --> 08:40.009
when he hears about all this.

08:40.553 --> 08:41.850
I know what you mean.

08:42.121 --> 08:45.249
Hey, Hannibal,
you think somebody really
did kill Colonel Morrison?

08:45.324 --> 08:46.586
I don't know.
Where we're concerned,

08:46.659 --> 08:48.251
the Army's
capable of anything,

08:48.327 --> 08:51.296
but I don't think
they'd manufacture
a lie like that.

08:51.831 --> 08:54.356
What bothers me
is where it could lead.

08:54.433 --> 08:57.163
Why would the idea of
a firing squad bother you?

08:57.436 --> 08:59.597
Face, are those guards
still out of sight?

09:06.345 --> 09:07.471
Yeah.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.447
I'm worried about Murdock.

09:09.649 --> 09:10.707
What about Murdock?

09:10.783 --> 09:14.651
I mean, as far as
they're concerned,
he's just our chopper pilot.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.052
Yeah, but think about
somethin' for a minute.

09:17.456 --> 09:21.256
When we left for Hanoi,
Morrison was still breathing,
right?

09:21.561 --> 09:22.687
Sure.

09:22.762 --> 09:25.230
He's the one
that gave us the final
go-ahead on the mission.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.528
And who was the last one
to see Morrison alive?

09:27.600 --> 09:32.537
Well, Murdock
reported back to HQ
after dropping us off.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.196
What you trying to say?

09:34.273 --> 09:36.264
Crazy Man Murdock
didn't kill nobody.

09:36.342 --> 09:39.311
I know that, B.A.
And you know that.

09:40.012 --> 09:42.674
But is that what
the prosecutor would think?

10:07.239 --> 10:09.503
Hey, Murdock,
how's it going, huh?

10:09.575 --> 10:11.440
As if you didn't know.

10:12.144 --> 10:15.136
Listen, I was thinking,
maybe I could watch
some of the trial with you.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.546
You know, lend a little
support to our boys.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.016
I wanna talk to you,
come on.

10:19.085 --> 10:20.484
Hey, hey. Stop.

10:20.553 --> 10:23.044
I just wanna make
a little correction
to something you said.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.352
See, it's not "our boys,"

10:25.424 --> 10:27.688
it's "my boys."
Not "our boys."

10:27.760 --> 10:30.558
Okay, okay.
What do you want from me?

10:30.896 --> 10:34.195
I already told you Stockwell
made me do it, didn't l?

10:34.266 --> 10:35.563
Oh, that's right, yeah.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.229
He was holding up
your dear father's
pension checks, right?

10:38.304 --> 10:40.772
Well, that's a touching
fiction, Frankie.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.637
That was for real,
Murdock.

10:42.708 --> 10:46.542
And besides, who was it that
got the best lawyer around
to handle the case, huh?

10:46.612 --> 10:48.637
Frankie Santana,
that's who.

10:48.714 --> 10:52.309
Well, lucky for
Frankie Santana that
Hannibal believes you.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.017
What's he doin' here?

11:00.893 --> 11:03.726
Now you've got somebody
you can watch the trial with.

11:10.269 --> 11:12.737
Mr. Curtis, how did you
come to know the accused?

11:13.539 --> 11:16.997
I met them in Vietnam
while serving with
the late Colonel Sam Morrison.

11:17.076 --> 11:18.805
And how long were you
with Colonel Morrison?

11:18.878 --> 11:20.038
Two years, sir.

11:20.112 --> 11:23.240
Until he was murdered
in January of 1971.

11:23.315 --> 11:27.012
Objection. The issue of murder
is the ultimate legal issue
before this court

11:27.086 --> 11:30.544
to be determined by
this honorable body,
not by the witness.

11:30.623 --> 11:33.091
All right, check it out.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.457
My man, Bennie.
All his friends
call him Bennie.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.655
He's gonna make mincemeat
out of these bozos.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.994
Your honor,
Colonel Morrison's
body was exhumed

11:40.066 --> 11:42.694
from Arlington National
Cemetery last week.

11:42.768 --> 11:44.929
I make an offer of
proof to this court,

11:45.004 --> 11:47.598
and let the record reflect
that I now submit

11:47.673 --> 11:52.007
the official pathology
findings of the Army's
Medical Corps director.

11:52.745 --> 11:55.305
Colonel Morrison
was murdered.

11:55.715 --> 11:59.879
Shot twice at close range,
prior to the enemy shelling.

12:00.352 --> 12:02.820
I acknowledge prior receipt
of this report, your honor,

12:02.888 --> 12:05.618
but object to
its entry into evidence
on the grounds of hearsay.

12:05.691 --> 12:09.127
JUDGE: Overruled, Mr. Conway.
You may proceed, Major.

12:09.195 --> 12:12.653
Just exactly when do we get to
the "mincemeat" part, Frankie?

12:12.765 --> 12:14.027
Are you kidding me?

12:14.100 --> 12:17.536
See, he's just letting
them get a false
sense of security, see.

12:17.603 --> 12:22.199
Mr. Curtis, please tell this
court exactly what happened
on 27 January, 1971.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.566
Colonel Morrison told me
that he had discovered

12:24.643 --> 12:27.976
that Smith, Peck,
and Baracus had planned on

12:28.047 --> 12:30.140
robbing the Bank of Hanoi.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.008
The Colonel's signature
had been forged

12:33.085 --> 12:36.213
on orders requesting
a helicopter for that mission.

12:36.288 --> 12:39.155
The Colonel had always
trusted the A-Team implicitly.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.659
This news
was quite a shock to him.

12:41.727 --> 12:43.194
(CHUCKLlNG)
Objection, your honor.

12:43.262 --> 12:47.198
This man's entire testimony
is based on nothing but
hearsay and speculation.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.097
It lacks foundation.

12:49.168 --> 12:50.726
Okay. Now, pay attention,
amigo.

12:50.803 --> 12:52.862
We're gonna show them how
we do it in the big leagues.

12:52.938 --> 12:56.237
I offer into evidence
the same offer of proof.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.875
A duplicate of the
document in question.

12:59.078 --> 13:02.775
Handwriting experts
confirm that Colonel
Morrison's signature

13:02.848 --> 13:05.112
is, in fact, a forgery

13:05.951 --> 13:08.442
in the hand of
Lieutenant Templeton Peck.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.148
CONWAY: Best evidence rule,
your honor,

13:10.222 --> 13:13.089
unless the prosecution
can show location
and condition

13:13.159 --> 13:16.822
of the original documents,
how can we rely
on mere copies?

13:17.563 --> 13:21.294
This document had
its origin in the combat zone,
Mr. Conway.

13:21.867 --> 13:24.734
We will allow the duplicates
for what they're worth.

13:24.804 --> 13:25.998
(PEOPLE MURMURlNG)

13:26.071 --> 13:29.700
Well, I think things are
going rather nicely so far,
don't you?

13:30.376 --> 13:32.367
I don't know where
he got that phony paper.

13:32.444 --> 13:36.847
Morrison signed the orders
in front of me and handed
them to me personally.

13:37.349 --> 13:39.408
Please continue,
Mr. Curtis.

13:40.586 --> 13:43.521
Well, l... I left
the GHQ for dinner.

13:43.589 --> 13:47.548
Colonel Morrison said
he was going to stay there
and confront the A-Team.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.423
CURTlS: When I returned,
I heard a very loud argument

13:51.497 --> 13:53.761
from the Colonel's office.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.058
The Colonel was saying,

13:56.135 --> 13:58.399
"Just because you're
a member of the A-0Team,

13:58.470 --> 13:59.869
"doesn't mean you
can threaten me. "

14:00.372 --> 14:03.034
Did you recognize
the voice of the man
with Colonel Morrison?

14:03.108 --> 14:05.133
Yes, sir, I did. It was...

14:05.845 --> 14:08.541
It was one of the accused,
Colonel John Smith.

14:09.148 --> 14:12.049
I left immediately
to alert the MPs,

14:12.117 --> 14:16.053
but that was the exact
same time that the shelling
began from the enemy.

14:16.755 --> 14:18.586
CURTlS: Our headquarters
took a direct hit.

14:18.657 --> 14:21.558
I didn't think anyone
could survive that explosion.

14:22.294 --> 14:24.262
As I looked through the smoke
and the flames,

14:24.330 --> 14:27.094
I did see someone run
from that building.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.496
I swear it was
Colonel John Smith.

You're not the only one
who's concerned.

When we first met to
discuss an association
with the A-Team,

15:47.079 --> 15:49.138
I had no idea I was
employing murderers.

You weren't.

15:50.983 --> 15:53.144
We didn't kill
Colonel Morrison.

Well, I understand the Army
is reviewing candidates
for your firing squad.

Oh, gee. You didn't have
to go to all this trouble
just to cheer me up.

16:02.528 --> 16:05.520
Obviously, my initial
instincts were mistaken.

Well, I've got
a suggestion for you.

16:19.511 --> 16:22.742
Obviously, somebody made
a deal with Josh Curtis.

They agreed to layoff
that slime-ball,
gun-running back of his,

16:27.987 --> 16:30.353
in return for
rolling over on the A-Team.

16:30.422 --> 16:32.947
Now, if you're really
interested in us,

16:33.025 --> 16:36.358
why don't you use
your influence in
Washington to clear us?

16:36.795 --> 16:39.821
Are you suggesting
that I interfere with
the due process of law?

16:43.502 --> 16:46.494
I figured I'd do better
with a firing squad.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.651

of leaving very deep scars.

to talk about it at all.

Mr. Curtis, how do you
earn your living, sir?

I'm in the import-export

many laws they broke,

I can tell you this.
Rules mean nothing
to these men,

for which they are accused.

Colonel Decker, in those
three long years that
you pursued the A-Team,

18:43.188 --> 18:47.557
were you ever aware of any
civilians who were in trouble
that they might have helped?

18:47.960 --> 18:48.949
I was.

18:49.027 --> 18:50.756
In your estimation,

18:51.196 --> 18:55.360
how many civilians who were
in trouble did they help
in those three years?

18:55.434 --> 18:57.231
I wouldn't know.
Well, take a guess.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.826

that Colonel Morrison

26:23.381 --> 26:26.009
Colonel Morrison
was not an enemy.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.951
So the distinction is
that killing the Viet Cong
was okay?

26:29.020 --> 26:30.453
Now who's insulting the court?

26:30.522 --> 26:32.752
Just answer the question,
Colonel.

26:32.991 --> 26:35.653
The Viet Cong was the enemy.

26:37.062 --> 26:39.360
They killed us,
we killed them.

26:47.839 --> 26:49.204
Your honor,

26:49.507 --> 26:52.101
it may be true
that money alone

26:52.177 --> 26:54.771
was not enough of a motive
for killing Colonel Morrison.

26:54.846 --> 26:57.940
Colonel Smith would
have us believe there
was no motive whatsoever

26:58.016 --> 27:00.883
for murdering a
respected senior officer.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.785
Therefore, I would like
to submit as rebuttal
evidence at this time,

27:03.855 --> 27:05.345
a significant new document

27:05.423 --> 27:08.950
which has only just now
been declassified and
come into my possession.

27:09.694 --> 27:14.597
It is secret congressional
testimony on the US conduct
of the Vietnam conflict,

27:14.899 --> 27:18.995
by one Colonel Chun Van Quyet

27:19.537 --> 27:20.868
of the North Vietnamese Army.

27:20.939 --> 27:24.136
Objection! This eleventh-hour
maneuver must be disallowed

27:24.209 --> 27:27.838
on the grounds that
Colonel Quyet is not here
for cross examination.

27:27.912 --> 27:31.939
Your honor, in exchange for
his valuable cooperation
with postwar intelligence,

27:32.017 --> 27:33.814
the Army provided
Colonel Quyet

27:33.885 --> 27:36.854
with a confidential,
new identity in this country.

27:37.222 --> 27:40.919
While I know no precedents,
I'll take the evidence
under advisement.

27:41.126 --> 27:45.722
You will note
that on page 1174,

27:46.231 --> 27:49.758
Colonel Quyet has documented
a list of 20 American soldiers

27:49.834 --> 27:53.292
who provided information
to the North Vietnamese Army
in exchange for money.

27:53.371 --> 27:55.134
At the top of that list

27:55.206 --> 27:58.198
you will find the name
of one Samuel Morrison,

Colonel, United States Army.

28:01.579 --> 28:02.944
Colonel Smith,

28:03.014 --> 28:05.539
I submit that you,
Lieutenant Peck,
and Sergeant Baracus

28:05.617 --> 28:07.642
discovered that Morrison
was working with the enemy.

28:07.719 --> 28:10.381
You acted as judge and jury,
you took the law
into your own hands,

28:10.455 --> 28:12.320

in cold blood.

a rabbit under those hats,

to chat.

I know where you're going.
You're going after that
Colonel Quyet, huh?

You figured he would've
known Morrison sent you
on that mission, right?

28:37.782 --> 28:40.273
Right.
Well, did it ever
occur to you

28:40.351 --> 28:42.478
that maybe you're gonna
need some help, huh?

made the same mistake in 1971.

Was it Colonel Smith?

under oath that he had
returned to headquarters.

I mean, we blocked
the guy's door. We don't
even know if he's home yet.

39:06.477 --> 39:07.535
What if he left town already?

39:07.611 --> 39:08.839
No, no, no, he hasn't left.

39:08.913 --> 39:11.313
I just saw him pop
his head right out
through the curtains.

39:11.382 --> 39:12.440
Are you ready?

39:12.516 --> 39:15.314
Yeah, but I still don't
think it's gonna work.

39:15.753 --> 39:17.778
Don't be discouraged, son.

Hey!

Frankie, Frankie,
don't you wanna pick up
all the garbage in the alley?

40:20.484 --> 40:23.180
I told you this was dumb.
I can't get this thing to...

40:23.654 --> 40:24.746
work.

40:31.695 --> 40:33.162
I'm a genius.

Welcome to Fantasy Island,
Colonel.

40:54.251 --> 40:56.310
What do you want with me?
Information.

40:56.387 --> 40:57.445
I have nothing to say.

40:57.521 --> 40:59.079
Too bad. Let her rip!

41:00.591 --> 41:02.923
Every litter bit
hurts, Colonel.

41:05.062 --> 41:06.086
Stop it! Stop it!

41:06.163 --> 41:09.155
Okay, okay, I'll tell you
what you wanna know?

41:09.800 --> 41:12.360
Was Colonel Morrison
a North Vietnamese
operative?

41:12.436 --> 41:13.494
Yes.

41:13.571 --> 41:16.563
Then why did he send
the A-Team to rob
the Bank of Hanoi?

41:16.640 --> 41:18.767
It was supposed
to be a trap.

41:18.843 --> 41:21.812
But the message
couldn't get to our unit
in time to stop them.

41:21.879 --> 41:24.211
It was to be an embarrassment
to your country.

Throw down your weapons,
you're surrounded.

41:32.790 --> 41:35.020
You are a fool. I called them.

41:35.092 --> 41:37.185
You must now release me,
or you will die.

41:37.261 --> 41:40.958
A Fighting Nighthawk Commando
doesn't know the meaning
of the word "die"!

41:41.031 --> 41:44.057
What's the first commandment,
Franklin?

41:44.134 --> 41:46.102
Never leave your cap out
in plain view, right?

Yeah. They could
at least smile.

Stop these proceedings!
Stop the proceedings!

43:07.051 --> 43:08.416
Your honor.

43:11.021 --> 43:13.990
We have located
a very important witness,

43:14.058 --> 43:17.152
and I believe he can finally
shed some light on this case.

43:18.829 --> 43:20.194
Is that you, Captain Murdock?

43:20.397 --> 43:21.887
Yes, it is, your honor.

43:21.966 --> 43:23.900
And if you'll bear with me,

43:23.968 --> 43:26.664
I believe we can finally
establish some testimony here

43:26.737 --> 43:30.264
that will once and for all
and beyond a shadow
of a doubt prove

43:30.441 --> 43:33.433
that A-Team is innocent
of all charges.

I do.

What is your name, sir?

43:53.464 --> 43:54.795
Chun Van Quyet.

43:54.865 --> 43:59.268
Are you not the same gentleman
who gave a statement before
the United States Congress

43:59.336 --> 44:02.772
in regard to
Colonel Morrison's work
for the Viet Cong?

44:03.107 --> 44:04.301
I am.

44:04.408 --> 44:05.534
CONWAY: I see.

44:05.876 --> 44:08.868
Would you give us
your version
of the famed mission

44:08.946 --> 44:10.914
on the National Bank
of Hanoi, sir?

44:11.715 --> 44:13.706
I was shocked
when it happened.

44:13.784 --> 44:16.446
Well, wait a minute.
That's not what you told me.

44:16.687 --> 44:20.748
We should have anticipated
the A-Team was capable
of such a mission.

44:20.824 --> 44:23.622
I wish Colonel Morrison and l
could have recruited them.

44:23.694 --> 44:25.059
CONWAY: What do
you mean by this?

44:25.129 --> 44:28.326
QUYET: I had many times
told Morrison, we should
make them an offer.

44:28.399 --> 44:32.768
But he always said no.
He said they were
loyal American patriots.

44:33.637 --> 44:35.605
Loyal American patriots?

44:36.206 --> 44:39.937
Colonel Morrison,
the man that these men were
supposed to have killed

44:40.010 --> 44:42.877
in fact held the A-Team
in high regard?

44:42.946 --> 44:43.935
No.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.039
He feared them.

44:47.017 --> 44:49.281
Colonel Morrison told me that

44:49.353 --> 44:52.880
if Smith and the A-Team
discovered he was an agent,

44:54.091 --> 44:56.025
they would not hesitate
to kill him.

45:07.671 --> 45:09.639
What do you think, General?

45:09.873 --> 45:12.637
I think the A-Team
looks as guilty as hell.

45:13.744 --> 45:16.736
However, the guilty
must pay for their crimes.

45:17.281 --> 45:19.681
They must have
known the risks.

45:19.750 --> 45:21.115
Tell the pilot I'm ready.
