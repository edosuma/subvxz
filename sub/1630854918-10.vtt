important person in my life

I was also something else.

00:17.258 --> 00:19.157
After an unfortunate incident

00:19.295 --> 00:21.400
where I found out
our whole life was a lie,

00:21.538 --> 00:23.851
now I'm also a spy.

00:25.266 --> 00:27.268
HARRY:
Honey, all those things
are true.

00:27.406 --> 00:28.787
-They're just, you know...
-HELEN: What?

00:28.925 --> 00:31.100
HARRY:
True lies.

Babe, hurry.

00:46.253 --> 00:47.185
I'm trying.

00:49.428 --> 00:51.775
I think they're
searching the offices.

00:51.913 --> 00:53.087
What do you want me to do
if they come in?

00:53.225 --> 00:54.571
Shoot 'em.

01:06.618 --> 01:08.689
Ah. Bingo.

01:08.827 --> 01:10.794
-Okay.
-Guys, I got guards incoming.

01:10.932 --> 01:12.106
I don't think I can do this.

-Ah.

01:15.316 --> 01:17.042
You can do this, honey.
This is what you trained for.

01:17.180 --> 01:19.355
I didn't kill anyone
in training, Harry.

01:19.493 --> 01:20.356
On these missions,
you're always the one

01:20.494 --> 01:21.529
that does all the real shooting.

01:24.463 --> 01:25.740
No shooting necessary.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.225
-[sighs]
-Come on.

01:27.363 --> 01:28.985
How much time do we have left?

01:29.123 --> 01:30.400
30 seconds.

01:30.538 --> 01:33.300
-I'm not talking about the bomb.
-Oh.

01:33.438 --> 01:36.441
Uh, 19 minutes.
Oh, hope there's no traffic.

01:36.579 --> 01:37.718
Yeah, okay.

01:53.872 --> 01:55.770
Nice work, guys.

01:55.908 --> 01:57.013
It was Helen's first time

01:57.151 --> 01:58.463
guarding the door.
She did great.

01:58.601 --> 02:00.327
Yeah, only because I didn't
have to shoot anybody.

02:00.465 --> 02:02.467
I almost wet my tactical pants.

What's our ETA?

02:05.021 --> 02:06.160

Seven minutes.

02:06.298 --> 02:07.403
Cutting it pretty close.
Hit the gas.

02:07.541 --> 02:08.990
You got it.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.163
Whoa!

02:12.822 --> 02:14.651
DOUG: It's insanity.

02:14.789 --> 02:17.102
And the travel budget
for the geology department

02:17.240 --> 02:19.829
is a knife fight
for every dollar.

02:19.966 --> 02:22.901
But anthropology can travel
anywhere they want.

You know, I heard

02:28.251 --> 02:29.459
that there was a huge explosion

02:29.597 --> 02:30.909
at the Venezuelan
consulate tonight.

02:33.394 --> 02:34.671
-Oh, really?
-ALICE: Mm-hmm.

02:34.809 --> 02:36.466
I ran out to get
some more cilantro,

02:36.603 --> 02:37.812
almost didn't make it back

02:37.950 --> 02:40.884
because I-395 was gridlocked.

02:41.022 --> 02:43.266
But I knew a shortcut,

02:43.404 --> 02:46.511
so I cut across three lanes
to the exit.

02:46.649 --> 02:48.478
Sounds like you guys
get all the excitement.

02:48.616 --> 02:49.617

[laughs] We do.

02:49.755 --> 02:50.963

I can't believe

02:52.793 --> 02:54.070
worrying about shooting someone

02:54.208 --> 02:56.314
wasn't the worst part of my day.

02:56.452 --> 02:58.005
That was awful.

02:58.143 --> 02:59.696
There's something
about Doug's voice

02:59.834 --> 03:01.077
that just makes me want
to punch him in the throat.

03:01.215 --> 03:02.251
Harry.

03:02.389 --> 03:04.011
But in a nice way.

03:04.149 --> 03:05.978
[groans] I don't understand
why it's so hard

03:06.116 --> 03:07.842
to find couple friends.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.673
You know? It was already
hard enough before,

03:10.811 --> 03:12.502
and now that we're both spies,

03:12.640 --> 03:14.401
it's, like, do we have
anything in common with anyone?

03:14.539 --> 03:16.334
Well, I thought
we really hit it off

03:16.472 --> 03:18.232
with that couple
from counterintel.

03:18.370 --> 03:20.890
The people who wouldn't
stop talking about

03:21.028 --> 03:22.478

03:22.616 --> 03:24.790
for secure data systems?

03:24.928 --> 03:27.103
Honey, more like
counterinteresting.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.279
Maybe it's too hard.

03:30.417 --> 03:31.970
It's not like anyone's gonna
understand what it's like

03:32.108 --> 03:34.662
to be us.
Other spies aren't married.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.423
Well, you still
have your yoga friends

03:36.561 --> 03:38.079
and I still
have my bowling pals.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.426
I know, but I want people that

03:39.564 --> 03:41.393
we can be ourselves
around, you know?

03:41.531 --> 03:43.740
Like, you could do
spy stuff with him

03:43.878 --> 03:46.605
and then I could talk to her
about clothes and guns.

03:46.743 --> 03:47.917
And then at the end of the day,

03:48.055 --> 03:50.091
we could all laugh
about spy snafus.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.576
Like when you throw a grenade,

03:51.714 --> 03:53.509
but you forgot to pull the pin.

03:55.545 --> 03:57.133

with Alice and Doug.

04:09.766 --> 04:12.217
Hey, you know what
wouldn't be boring?

Punching Doug in the throat.

-No?
-No punching, either.

Hernan Alvaro Ochoa

04:47.977 --> 04:51.291
has gained control

Ochoa is known
to hold anti-Western views.

04:54.673 --> 04:57.158
Analysis suggests that
he plans to attack Miami,

04:57.297 --> 04:59.782
initiating a new Cold War

Bad news is we know zilch

Perfect.
It's a great way for you guys

09:56.596 --> 09:57.735

-Remember, it's the book

09:57.873 --> 09:59.150

-who's dying of a broken heart?
-Yeah,

10:00.634 --> 10:02.429
I think
The Orchid Templeis, uh,

10:02.567 --> 10:04.431
way more your area
of expertise on this op.

It's a beautiful book.

10:11.956 --> 10:12.853
Harry,

10:12.991 --> 10:14.648
I will tell you this:

10:14.786 --> 10:17.099
this woman has
amazing taste in clothing.

10:17.237 --> 10:18.238
-Oh.
-Oh, and it looks like

10:18.376 --> 10:19.791
they just went shopping.

10:19.929 --> 10:22.173
All right,
this is gonna take a minute.

10:22.311 --> 10:24.589
[whispers]:
Harry, lots of shopping.

10:24.727 --> 10:27.592
Looks like they bought
some new Vans.

-One green, one blue.

they have teenagers like us.

Harry, they sound fun.

foreign intelligence targets.

back to the room.

take out the whole regime.

activity in your area?

Luther and Maria did a sweep.

Everything looks clear,

12:12.593 --> 12:13.629

in the alley just in case.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.665
All right, we're on our way.

12:15.804 --> 12:17.150
I hope Valentina
likes this dress.

12:17.288 --> 12:19.739
I can already tell
she's a vibrant lady.

12:19.877 --> 12:21.257
So, I wore green,

12:21.395 --> 12:22.845
and it's a little vintage, but

12:22.983 --> 12:24.088
when I looked through
all of her stuff,

12:24.226 --> 12:25.434
I noticed she had
kind of a retro style.

12:25.572 --> 12:27.436
Well, everything's
pretty much retro in Cuba.

12:27.574 --> 12:29.300
I know all of her favorite
foods, I know all

12:29.438 --> 12:30.301
of her favorite hobbies.
I feel like

12:30.439 --> 12:32.475
she's my best friend already.

But remember, this is a mission.
We're not here to get

to take out a rogue general
that wants to blow up Miami.

Yes. All the more reason
to wear the right dress.

Wait, slow down.
What's going on?

how to waterski at all.

I don't know how to waterski,

13:16.623 --> 13:18.314

Okay, well, if you're
so worried about it,

13:19.729 --> 13:21.317
why don't you ask Tori
if she can teach you?

13:21.455 --> 13:24.079
I can't. That's the thing.
She's gonna convince me to try,

13:24.217 --> 13:25.977
I'm gonna wipe out,
all of her friends

13:26.115 --> 13:27.530

13:27.668 --> 13:29.084

It's more than okay.
It's very brave.

They're Ochoa's men.

18:47.229 --> 18:49.058
I thought you were bureaucrats.

18:49.197 --> 18:50.646
[grunts]

18:50.784 --> 18:52.303
They fight like this
at the State Department?

18:52.441 --> 18:54.029
Gib, talk to me.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.237
We're surrounded, all right?
Get out of there,

18:55.375 --> 18:56.204
now. Get out of there.

18:57.964 --> 18:59.621
-Go. We got to go.
-Vamos.

18:59.759 --> 19:01.070
HELEN:
Harry...

19:04.315 --> 19:06.490
Okay.

19:06.628 --> 19:08.181
[shouts in Spanish]

19:08.319 --> 19:09.907
All right, all right.

19:10.045 --> 19:11.080
[thumping on van]

19:13.773 --> 19:15.499
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay.

19:15.637 --> 19:17.397
American citizen.
Take it easy, take it easy.

19:17.535 --> 19:19.606
[van door shuts]

19:19.744 --> 19:21.125
We're American citizens.

19:22.057 --> 19:23.886
[men speaking Spanish]

19:27.718 --> 19:29.720
LUTHER:
They're capturing that
jackass from yesterday.

19:29.858 --> 19:31.825
What's happening?

19:31.963 --> 19:33.965
[commandos speaking Spanish]

19:43.216 --> 19:45.184
[grunts]

19:46.978 --> 19:49.326
-What about the team?
-We can't save them
if we're dead.

19:49.464 --> 19:51.431
The valet left that running.
Get in the car.

19:51.569 --> 19:52.846
[gunshots]

20:10.864 --> 20:12.970
So...

20:13.108 --> 20:15.800
I have a wobbly shoe.

20:15.938 --> 20:18.976
And you two are spies?

20:19.114 --> 20:21.599
[scoffs] Sí.

20:21.737 --> 20:23.877
As are you, I assume.

20:26.052 --> 20:26.949
-Que arroz con mango.
-[scoffs]

20:27.087 --> 20:28.606
What'd he say about mangoes?

20:28.744 --> 20:30.781
It means we're in
a sticky situation.

20:30.919 --> 20:31.920
I can't believe this.

20:32.058 --> 20:33.577
Did you even read

20:33.715 --> 20:35.130
The Orchid Temple?

20:35.268 --> 20:37.097
[gasps]
What about you?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.962
-You're a spy, too.
-Mm-hmm.

20:40.100 --> 20:41.585
-Was anything
about our lunch even real?
-HARRY: All right, look.

20:41.723 --> 20:43.172
We can't trust each other,
we got that.

20:43.311 --> 20:45.244
But we both want
to take out Ochoa.

20:45.382 --> 20:46.797
You guys just beat us
to the punch on the ask.

20:46.935 --> 20:48.868
And now we're all blown.

20:49.006 --> 20:50.594
HELEN:
Yeah, and somebody
tipped him off.

20:50.732 --> 20:51.664
You guys have a mole.

20:51.802 --> 20:52.975
[scoffs]

20:53.113 --> 20:54.874
It was not someone on our team.

20:55.012 --> 20:56.600
Well, it wasn't ours.

20:56.738 --> 20:58.084
We got a radio warning.
You didn't.

20:58.222 --> 20:59.913
Plus, those commandos

21:00.051 --> 21:01.777
rushed in pretty fast after
you mentioned Ochoa's name.

21:01.915 --> 21:03.020
Who'd you have listening?

21:04.297 --> 21:05.436
Wait.

21:05.574 --> 21:07.473
Flor-- sh-she was on our radios.

21:07.611 --> 21:09.198
No, no, no, no, you can't think
for a second that it was Flor.

21:09.337 --> 21:11.062
Because I trust her
with my life.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.926
Mi amor,think about it.

21:13.064 --> 21:15.135
Why else would
Ochoa be in Panama?

21:15.274 --> 21:17.586
She must have told him
we were going to be here,

21:17.724 --> 21:19.312
working against him.

21:19.450 --> 21:21.625
As soon as we made our move,
he sent his commandos.

21:21.763 --> 21:23.868
He wants to stop us
before we can stop him.

21:24.006 --> 21:25.525
Oh, but Flor is like family.

21:25.663 --> 21:27.182
I mean, she's basically

21:27.320 --> 21:28.977
the third person
in our marriage. I...

21:29.115 --> 21:30.772
I can't believe this.

21:30.910 --> 21:33.740
Harry, I think their Gib

21:33.878 --> 21:36.053
captured our Gib.

21:37.019 --> 21:39.677
[grunting]

21:39.815 --> 21:42.093
GIB: You know...

21:42.231 --> 21:45.304
you're gonna regret
capturing U.S. citizens.

21:45.442 --> 21:46.995
-I'm sure of it.
-You mean U.S. spies!

21:47.133 --> 21:49.756
[shouts, coughs]

21:49.894 --> 21:51.620
Geez, you kick hard.

22:00.974 --> 22:02.907
You run communications
for your team, right?

22:03.045 --> 22:06.152
You're gonna radio the two
operatives who escaped my men.

22:06.290 --> 22:08.257
And if they give me
what I want...

22:08.396 --> 22:09.811
then you will live.

22:09.949 --> 22:11.640
And what is it that you want?

22:11.778 --> 22:13.159
Los Pérez.

22:13.297 --> 22:16.265
Because their execution
will be an example

22:16.404 --> 22:18.440
to those who
oppose our movement.

22:18.578 --> 22:20.684
[coughs]

22:20.822 --> 22:22.513
Okay, and, uh...
[clears throat]

22:22.651 --> 22:24.929
...what about
the rest of my team?

22:25.067 --> 22:27.069
[scoffs] They're alive.

22:27.207 --> 22:29.693
For now, but that can change.

22:31.280 --> 22:33.628
Oh, you have no idea

22:33.766 --> 22:35.319
who you're up against,
you silly son of...

22:35.457 --> 22:37.252
-Hey.
-Aah!

22:37.390 --> 22:38.771
Listen to me.

22:38.909 --> 22:41.394
I think you're the one
who does not understand

22:41.532 --> 22:43.154
the situation, huh?

22:43.292 --> 22:45.950
[exclaims, gasps]

22:46.088 --> 22:47.331
If you want to see
your team again,

22:47.469 --> 22:48.953
I would suggest
that you cooperate.

23:14.254 --> 23:15.497
Very angry.

23:15.635 --> 23:17.223
Yeah.

23:17.361 --> 23:19.328
So...

23:19.467 --> 23:21.745
you and the Pérezes
are Cuban spies?

23:21.883 --> 23:23.643
-Why would I tell you anything?
-Spies?

23:23.781 --> 23:26.784
That's why you wanted my table:
counterintelligence.

23:26.922 --> 23:27.854
I should have just
shot you instead.

23:27.992 --> 23:29.062
Then we wouldn't be here.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.478
Typical communist.

23:30.616 --> 23:31.927
Just shoot anyone
who doesn't agree with you.

23:32.065 --> 23:33.688
No, not everyone.

23:33.826 --> 23:35.310
Only imperialists who want
to tell us how to live.

23:35.448 --> 23:37.036
Oh, why, 'cause we're right?

23:37.174 --> 23:39.590
Dude, you're driving around
in, like, 50-year-old cars.

23:39.728 --> 23:41.420
Thanks to your blockade.
!¡Oye!

23:41.558 --> 23:42.904
And call me when your country

23:43.042 --> 23:44.215
has free dental care,
you arrogant son...

23:44.353 --> 23:45.976
[exclaims] !¡Basta!

23:46.114 --> 23:47.564
[exhales]

23:47.702 --> 23:49.220
Do you guys want to die in here?

23:49.358 --> 23:50.877
Now shut up.

23:52.223 --> 23:54.225
We need a plan.

23:56.952 --> 23:58.575
It's Gib.

24:04.373 --> 24:05.961
[Gib coughing]

24:06.099 --> 24:07.618
You got to bring
the Pérezes to Ochoa.

24:07.756 --> 24:09.068
[coughs]

24:09.206 --> 24:10.345
He's serious, Harry.

24:10.483 --> 24:12.140
I-I don't know what to do.

24:14.038 --> 24:14.970
He said he's gonna kill us all.

24:15.108 --> 24:16.109
[coughs]

24:17.386 --> 24:18.905
Let me speak to Ochoa.

24:20.804 --> 24:22.737
[speaking Spanish]

24:22.875 --> 24:24.601
Listen, you want your people,
I want mine.

24:24.739 --> 24:26.292
Alive and unhurt.

24:26.430 --> 24:28.674
Meet me in one hour.

24:28.812 --> 24:30.330
I will send the coordinates.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.471
Now, as for "unhurt..."

24:32.609 --> 24:35.059
[chuckles]

24:35.197 --> 24:37.337
[grunts]

24:37.476 --> 24:38.511
...there's nothing
that won't heal.

24:38.649 --> 24:40.927
Oh, my God. If we don't
give him the Pérezes,

24:41.065 --> 24:42.377
he's gonna kill Gib,
Maria and Luther.

24:42.515 --> 24:44.034
If we do, he's gonna
kill the Pérezes.

24:44.172 --> 24:45.967
And blow up Miami, to boot.

24:46.105 --> 24:48.452
Well, there has to be
another option.

24:48.590 --> 24:50.523
There is something we can try,

24:50.661 --> 24:52.180
but it puts all of our lives
in their hands.

24:52.318 --> 24:54.216
How much do you trust
the Pérezes?

24:58.048 --> 25:00.740
They're fun.

25:00.878 --> 25:02.846
But I don't know about
trusting them with our lives.

25:02.984 --> 25:05.193
Can't you and I just do it?

25:05.331 --> 25:07.575
We can, but our chances
go from low to tiny.

25:07.713 --> 25:09.611
I need exact percentages.

25:09.749 --> 25:12.096
You don't want
exact percentages.

25:12.234 --> 25:15.548
You haven't had a lot
of experience shooting people.

25:15.686 --> 25:17.757
And we need all
the firepower we can get.

25:17.895 --> 25:19.069
Yeah.

25:24.143 --> 25:25.593
-But how do we know?
-We don't.

25:25.731 --> 25:27.422
You just have to take a leap.

25:27.560 --> 25:30.252
Yeah, but what if we leap
and they don't catch us?

25:31.771 --> 25:33.739
Then everybody dies.

25:39.296 --> 25:41.919
Oh, wow, what kind of spy
sells out his team

25:42.057 --> 25:43.783
the second something goes wrong?

25:43.921 --> 25:45.164
Gib didn't sell us out.

25:45.302 --> 25:46.752
Oh, no?
Sounds like he rolled over

25:46.890 --> 25:48.167
and gave us all up.

25:48.305 --> 25:49.789
Gib was giving us intel.

25:49.927 --> 25:50.997
He coughed nine times.

25:51.135 --> 25:53.586
That means nine commandos
on site.

25:53.724 --> 25:55.105
He repeated a word three times

25:55.243 --> 25:57.141
at the start of a sentence--
three entry points.

25:57.279 --> 25:59.281
Gib wasn't giving up.
He was giving us

25:59.419 --> 26:00.593
what we need to attack Ochoa.

26:02.388 --> 26:05.011
We just can't do it on our own.

26:05.149 --> 26:06.910
[Valentina speaks Spanish]

26:07.048 --> 26:08.774
[scoffs]

26:08.912 --> 26:10.465
You know what you are asking
of us, right?

26:10.603 --> 26:12.674
Yes.
Yes, I do.

26:12.812 --> 26:14.020
Forgive me, but how do we know
that you won't

26:14.158 --> 26:15.470
betray us to save your team?

26:15.608 --> 26:16.954
You don't.

26:17.092 --> 26:18.404
The same way we don't know

26:18.542 --> 26:19.854
whether or not you'll betray us.

26:19.992 --> 26:21.649
But if we don't work together,

26:21.787 --> 26:23.340
everybody dies.

26:23.478 --> 26:24.652
And Miami's obliterated.

26:24.790 --> 26:26.412
Which means war.

26:28.621 --> 26:31.003
Well, it looks like
we all have something to lose.

26:33.522 --> 26:35.732
Okay.

26:35.870 --> 26:38.010
I swear on our kids

26:38.148 --> 26:40.564
you can trust us
to have your back.

26:40.702 --> 26:42.462
And I swear on ours.

26:44.706 --> 26:46.121
And to be clear,

26:46.259 --> 26:48.123
you actually have children?

26:48.261 --> 26:50.436
Because we do,
and they're amazing.

26:50.574 --> 26:52.265
And we want to go home to them.

26:52.403 --> 26:54.026
Believe me.

26:54.164 --> 26:55.406
-We want the same.
-Yeah.

27:00.584 --> 27:03.518
Oh, you have a whole handshake.

27:03.656 --> 27:06.141
So, look, I got an idea,
but it's too risky to go back

27:06.279 --> 27:07.729
to our place
and get the equipment.

27:07.867 --> 27:09.455
-We need guns.
-EMILIO: That's not a problem.

27:09.593 --> 27:12.078
There are guns everywhere.

27:13.701 --> 27:14.598
Huh.

27:15.979 --> 27:18.015
[grunting]

27:23.642 --> 27:25.644
You guys think if you wiggle
enough, you can break

27:25.782 --> 27:27.438
the ropes with
your can-do attitude?

27:27.576 --> 27:29.786
You have a better idea, nena?

27:31.166 --> 27:33.617
Actually, mijito,I do.

27:33.755 --> 27:35.930
My hair clip has a sharp edge.

27:36.068 --> 27:38.173
It's my "just in case I get
tied up with a jerk" knife.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.901
-You mean him, right?
-Oh.

27:42.039 --> 27:44.007
The jury's out.

27:44.145 --> 27:45.905
[sighs]
Tilt your head back.

27:46.043 --> 27:47.804
Let me see if I can
get it with my teeth.

27:47.942 --> 27:48.977
MARIA: Can-can you do it?

27:49.115 --> 27:50.289
It's just too far.

27:50.427 --> 27:51.911
[sighs] Right.

27:52.049 --> 27:53.913
It's the wrong side.

27:54.051 --> 27:56.157
Raul will have to get it.

27:56.295 --> 27:58.677
You can't trust
that guy with a knife.

27:58.815 --> 28:01.369
I've seen oil spills
that are less slippery than him.

28:01.507 --> 28:04.096
I am tied up next to
your mangy neck because

28:04.234 --> 28:06.443
I am also trying to stop Ochoa.

28:06.581 --> 28:08.100
I want what's best
for my country.

28:08.238 --> 28:09.584
Oye.

28:18.766 --> 28:20.595
We're a country of immigrants.

28:20.733 --> 28:22.424
So if he's a pig, then so am I.

28:23.771 --> 28:25.186
-Oh, that's actually kind of...
-Shut up, Luther.

28:25.324 --> 28:26.843
-Okay, sorry.
-Shut up, Luther.

28:26.981 --> 28:28.983
-You shut up.
-We're gonna

28:29.121 --> 28:30.743
have to work together
if we want to get out of here.

28:30.881 --> 28:31.917
-Got it?
-Yes.

28:34.264 --> 28:35.714
Don't get any ideas.

28:37.232 --> 28:38.647
See those bars on the window?

28:38.786 --> 28:40.270
That's a stash house.

28:40.408 --> 28:42.168
You're gonna find
plenty of weapons in there.

28:42.306 --> 28:44.067
Let's go shopping.

28:48.347 --> 28:50.314
Okay.

28:50.452 --> 28:51.833
-So they're gonna
get a bunch of guns.
-Mm.

28:51.971 --> 28:54.077
Then we bring them to Ochoa.

28:54.215 --> 28:55.768
And then...

28:58.253 --> 28:59.392
...we shoot people?

28:59.530 --> 29:01.947
Yes.
