WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.461
NARRATOR:<i> In the last episode</i>
<i>of</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:03.545 --> 00:04.504
Freeze!

00:05.088 --> 00:07.632
Yeah. Fifty grand. Half is yours.

00:07.716 --> 00:10.260
From what I know
of the president's itinerary,

00:10.343 --> 00:12.971
I don't think he's gonna
have time to visit buildings...

00:13.054 --> 00:15.265
on Blood turf and Shamrock turf.

00:15.348 --> 00:16.516
ESTERHAUS: <i>It's Fay.</i>

00:16.599 --> 00:18.601
-What about Fay?
-She's been arrested.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.686
What you doing?

00:19.769 --> 00:21.521
You could've killed me, man!

00:21.604 --> 00:23.106
You could've killed me!

00:23.189 --> 00:24.441
MAN: You're under arrest.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.860
Nothing turns my stomach
like a crooked cop.

00:26.943 --> 00:28.445
You know what you need, Furillo?

00:28.528 --> 00:30.947
I've needed one of those for years.

00:34.200 --> 00:39.372
-(chattering)
-Item 12. Item 12!

00:39.456 --> 00:43.376
-(chattering continues)
-Officer Bates,

00:43.460 --> 00:45.837
will you please disseminate those copies

00:45.920 --> 00:49.215
-of the president's security plan?
-Here you go. Okay. Okay!

00:49.299 --> 00:52.177
-ESTERHAUS: Thank you.
-(chattering louder)

00:52.260 --> 00:53.678
Quiet, please.

00:55.972 --> 00:58.099
Shut up, everyone. Shut up!

00:58.683 --> 01:01.603
-(officers shushing, stop chattering)
-(clears throat)

01:02.145 --> 01:04.564
Now, I can well understand
your youthful excitement

01:04.647 --> 01:06.483
due to the president,

01:06.566 --> 01:08.651
but we still have our daily housework.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.153
MAN: (mumbles)

01:10.945 --> 01:12.530
Item 12.

01:14.282 --> 01:16.868
The rape/assault situation
up in St. James Park

01:16.951 --> 01:18.912
is not disappearing by itself.

01:18.995 --> 01:21.456
-(person clicks tongue)
-Another one early this morning,

01:21.539 --> 01:23.666
which brings the tally up
to an even dozen!

01:23.750 --> 01:25.752
-MAN: Another one?
-(woman groans)

01:25.835 --> 01:28.838
-Let's get on top of those animals, huh?
-(person chuckles)

01:28.922 --> 01:30.548
No pun intended.

01:33.259 --> 01:38.181
Hingle, Perez, Sneed, Lamonica--

01:38.973 --> 01:42.018
as of now,
you're off the projects and in the park.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.394
-MAN 1: Alright.
-MAN 2: Okay.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.729
All right, last item.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.482
The last item concerns image.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.735
We don't want the president
of the United States

01:50.819 --> 01:53.029
being escorted through this precinct...

01:53.905 --> 01:57.742
by what looks like
a group of blue gorillas.

01:57.826 --> 02:01.746
-(all chattering)
-MAN: He's talking to you.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.541
So, let's take a little time
between now and then

02:04.624 --> 02:06.042
to get our uniforms pressed,

02:06.126 --> 02:08.169
our faces shaved clean...

02:08.962 --> 02:12.132
-That means you, Renko!
-BATES: I'm gonna get a manicure.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.008
(all laughing)

02:14.467 --> 02:17.470
And side hair trimmed accordingly.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.348
LAMONICA: Sorry, Lucy.
Side hair's gotta go.

02:20.431 --> 02:23.977
-(all laughing, louder)
-Shut it off, twinks!

02:24.060 --> 02:28.648
(all hooting, chattering)

02:28.731 --> 02:31.234
All right, all right. Let's roll.

02:32.026 --> 02:34.988
And, uh, let's be careful out there.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.995
So, what do you think, Renko,
about right here?

02:42.078 --> 02:44.122
Maybe just raise it up about a 16th of--

02:44.205 --> 02:46.833
No, no, that's not the problem.
The problem is right here.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.626
-Hey!
-It's a gray hair.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.753
You're disintegrating
in front of my eyeballs.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.839
Hey, Renko, have you checked
the top of your head?

02:52.922 --> 02:54.924
-What?
-You're blowing fur, brother.

02:55.800 --> 02:56.676
You know what?

02:56.759 --> 02:58.720
You're gonna be combing
your hair with a washrag.

02:58.803 --> 03:01.723
I got hair. I got hair. Look, all up here.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.766
-I got hair I haven't even used yet.
-I see it.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.935
-But it's all in the wrong places.
-Mm.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.354
-Women love my hair.
-(chuckles)

03:08.438 --> 03:11.566
Well, they better start loving it
before they call you the Bald Cowboy.

03:11.649 --> 03:14.444
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:14.527 --> 03:16.487
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

03:16.571 --> 03:20.325
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:20.408 --> 03:23.244
(theme music playing)

03:27.290 --> 03:31.211
(instrumental music playing)

04:28.351 --> 04:30.728
What's the point?
What's he gonna fact-find, man?

04:30.812 --> 04:33.231
He's got his own inner city
in Washington, D.C.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.233
Yeah, but we got a class
inner city up here,

04:35.316 --> 04:38.111
-and the president knows class.
-(laughs)

04:38.194 --> 04:41.281
If it doesn't do D.C. no good,
what good does it do me?

04:41.364 --> 04:43.783
Oh, now, you see, there,
that's the problem, slick.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.994
Everyone's hung up
on what's in it for them.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.704
That's cash-register mentality.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.206
And El Diablo here has
a cash-register mentality.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.791
Here's cash register number one

04:51.874 --> 04:53.751
-and cash register number two.
-Tsk, tsk, tsk.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.712
-On the house, gentlemen?
-Negative, Bruce.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.881
-That's okay. We'll pay our way.
-Nah, don't wanna insult the man.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.301
Yeah, you and John D. LaRue.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.887
-PIMP: Later, man!
-You know something, Bobby?

05:04.971 --> 05:06.389
I'm a fine figure of a man.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.726
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I just said--

05:13.146 --> 05:15.273
-Look at slick's pimpmobile.
-Whoo, 1969--

05:15.356 --> 05:17.942
-You got television, a telephone.
-ragtop yellow convertible.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.737
-It probably has a wet bar.
-It's your basic recreation vehicle.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.030
Mm, mm, mm.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.741
Probably has more extras
than my apartment too.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.953
(engine starts, revs)

05:29.037 --> 05:30.413
You in the automobile!

05:30.913 --> 05:32.582
I want you to put your hands
over your head

05:32.665 --> 05:34.876
-and come out of that vehicle very slowly.
-(revving)

05:34.959 --> 05:39.005
-(engine stops)
-This is weird.

05:39.088 --> 05:41.007
Come on outta there with your hands up!

05:52.393 --> 05:54.354
Okay. Okay.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.939
-(door opens)
-He's not armed.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.442
It's cool. How you guys doing?

05:59.525 --> 06:01.736
Put your hands above your head.
Hands above your head.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.279
-Okay.
-Hey, don't get excited.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.197
Don't get excited.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.407
-I'm not a fighter. I don't fight.
-What is this, man?

06:06.491 --> 06:09.243
-I cooperate!
-This man's a walking hardware store.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.286
Hands on your back.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.163
Just don't think you guys
gotta lean on me.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.331
(handcuffs ratcheting)

06:13.414 --> 06:15.416
-Because I confess, you dig?
-Hey, no confessions

06:15.500 --> 06:18.211
-till I read you your rights. You dig?
-Whatever you say, man.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.213
All right. You have the right
to remain silent.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.131
You have the
right to speak with an attorney.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.425
If you can't afford one,
one will be appointed for you.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.468
-Okay.
-You got that?

06:25.551 --> 06:27.470
Yeah, man. You think
I'm stupid or something?

06:27.553 --> 06:29.597
No, I think you're the next
Albert Einstein.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.724
He started out stealing pimpmobiles.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.811
Hey, man, it takes me nine seconds flat.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.105
-What's the risk? This stupid--
-(engine cranking)

06:37.188 --> 06:38.606
Hey! Don't you kick my car!

06:38.689 --> 06:40.691
-(cranking continues)
-Why don't you kick him?

06:40.775 --> 06:43.403
Your ignition stinks, man.
It's all screwed together backwards.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.822
-You're driving around in a death trap.
-What do you know?

06:45.905 --> 06:48.241
-(cranking continues)
-Worthless piece of junk heap!

06:48.324 --> 06:51.494
-RENKO: Shut up! What?
-(cranking)

06:51.577 --> 06:53.621
HILL: Man, we gotta
call in for another car.

06:53.704 --> 06:56.707
Aw, man, this thing doesn't start,
and you ordered this unit this morning.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.918
It's flooded, man. I can smell it.
Pop the hood, will you?

06:59.836 --> 07:02.380
(Bobby, quietly) Pop the hood? Okay.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.923
-(lock releases)
-Pop the hood.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.301
-The latch, Renko. The latch?
-What?

07:09.679 --> 07:11.806
This is pathetic, man. This is ridiculous.

07:11.889 --> 07:13.266
This is totally neglected.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.935
-Is this your unit?
-No, no, it's a loaner.

07:16.018 --> 07:19.188
Yeah. Could you hand me
that crescent wrench over there, please?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.149
-Hey, uh, you mind?
-(handcuffs ratchet)

07:21.232 --> 07:23.443
-RENKO: No. Um, here.
-Thank you.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.194
-Can you work like this?
-Yes.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.571
All we gotta do

07:26.654 --> 07:29.490
-is take this baby off here.
-(clattering)

07:29.991 --> 07:32.326
The name is Floyd Stazwitz,

07:32.410 --> 07:34.954
but I kinda get off
on being called Malibu.

07:35.037 --> 07:37.957
I spent some time out there
pinstriping for this dude.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.793
It was the best deal I ever had
in my whole life, man:

07:40.877 --> 07:45.131
great beaches, great ladies, great smoke.

07:45.214 --> 07:47.341
That's why
I like the name Malibu, you know?

07:47.425 --> 07:50.094
Because when I hear it,
I think about Malibu,

07:50.178 --> 07:53.431
and it makes me feel good all over.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.516
-(bangs metal)
-Okay, fire it up.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.935
-(engine revs)
-(tires squeal)

07:58.019 --> 08:01.105
-Ho! Slap my--(indistinct)
-Hey! All right!

08:01.189 --> 08:04.233
-PIMP: All right!
-Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

08:04.317 --> 08:06.777
Ooh, what did you do to my baby, man?

08:06.861 --> 08:09.947
-Nothing runs like this.
-I got a flair for fixing things.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.533
Look, uh, Malibu,
I'm real sorry about this,

08:12.617 --> 08:15.203
but you are under arrest,
and I'm gonna have to take you downtown.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.914
-But I'll do everything I can to help you.
-Hey, it's cool, Renko.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.749
I mean, like, you guys are cops, right?

08:19.832 --> 08:22.710
And I'm a heist man.
I mean, that's life, right?

08:22.793 --> 08:24.837
Hey, hey, what about my ignition?

08:24.921 --> 08:29.509
-I ain't driving no death trap.
-Hey, takes me three minutes, tops.

08:32.803 --> 08:35.640
Sure. Why not? Three minutes, Malibu.

08:35.723 --> 08:36.891
Right.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.977
You know, I wouldn't mind
having him eyeball my "Z."

08:40.061 --> 08:41.938
Sucker's beginning to lose its punch.

08:43.272 --> 08:46.192
Now we're takin' a big chance
along this whole stretch, Frank.

08:46.275 --> 08:48.903
If the president so much as steps off
the east side of the avenue,

08:48.986 --> 08:52.073
-he'll be on Gypsy Boy turf.
-The problem's the sun, Henry.

08:52.156 --> 08:55.993
The east side of the avenue
will be in shade until 1:00,

08:56.077 --> 08:58.788
and that press secretary
wants the president filmed in sunlight.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.165
They declared independence
a couple of months ago.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.709
We've been trying to negotiate them back
into the United States.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.879
-Francis, can I have a word with you?
-Yeah, Phil.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.257
-Sergeant Esterhaus, Jerry Mullenex--
-Hi.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.259
-and Dave Bean, Secret Service.
-Francis, please.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.885
-Yes, yes.
-She's back.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.054
She just waltzed in and gave me this.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.889
I hate that woman's guts.

09:16.973 --> 09:20.268
She just takes
a little getting used to, Phil.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.186
Give her a chance, will you?
She's a good kid.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.772
We don't need decorators
to paint precinct houses.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.567
Brown is brown, green is green,
and painters paint.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.402
It's not up to us, Phil.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.779
It's a divisional directive.
That means you live with it.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.532
No matter how hard it is,
you get through it with her.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.450
Look at this book, huh?

09:36.534 --> 09:40.871
Look at those colors: avocado,
guava, peach, soft lemon.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.833
She's not painting a jail.
She's making fruit salad.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.168
Captain, I've seen enough.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.838
-We're ready to make a dry run.
-I'll ride with him, Frank.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.674
Oh, now wait a minute.
What about that Gypsy Boy turf?

09:51.757 --> 09:54.010
You're gonna respect
the boundary line, aren't you?

09:54.093 --> 09:55.219
We'll do the best we can.

09:55.303 --> 09:58.556
What say that, um,
we'll reconvene here about 12:30?

09:58.639 --> 09:59.849
Hold it.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.727
We've spent two years
cooling off that avenue.

10:02.810 --> 10:05.354
I'm a graduate
of the program, Furillo. (chuckles)

10:05.438 --> 10:08.441
You don't get this with blusher.
Come on. Have a little faith.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.197
PHIL: Francis, I'm considering retirement.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.907
I just want you to know that.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.659
I'm considering it too, Phil.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.621
Would you ask Ray to come
in here when he gets a chance?

10:21.704 --> 10:24.081
I have to have him coordinate
the helicopter landing

10:24.165 --> 10:25.249
with the park people.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.668
-Oh. Uh--
-Hey, Sarge.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.338
Hi. Internal Affairs wants
your shield and gun turned in

10:30.421 --> 10:32.590
until they figure out
what's gonna be with you.

10:32.673 --> 10:33.716
(quietly) I know.

10:35.593 --> 10:36.552
FRANK: Sit down.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.972
-I know you're busy, Captain.
-(slaps object on desk)

10:40.056 --> 10:43.100
We've been getting your record together
for the hearing this afternoon.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.561
-(drops object)
-(drawer closes)

10:46.771 --> 10:48.481
If I were you, I'd put on a suit and tie.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.358
Don't worry. I plan to.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.321
-You gonna be there, Captain?
-Satisfy something for me, LaRue.

10:55.404 --> 10:58.074
-Just how dirty are you?
-I was giving the money back to him.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.742
I told him I didn't want no part.

11:01.869 --> 11:04.372
I don't know about you, LaRue.
You used to be a hot item:

11:05.289 --> 11:08.250
citations, promotions,
prime arrest record.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.338
Between the women and the booze,
take a look at yourself now.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.964
Hey, I made a mistake, okay?

11:14.048 --> 11:16.842
Almost. He suckered me good.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.594
He told me half of Division was in on it.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.430
-And you believed that crap?
-Macafee said...

11:21.514 --> 11:24.767
Macafee suggested
that if I crossed anybody up at Division,

11:24.850 --> 11:26.769
I'd find myself
face down in the reservoir.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.813
-All right. Okay.
-How are you doing, Johnny?

11:28.896 --> 11:29.939
Okay, Ray.

11:32.274 --> 11:35.194
I wouldn't go into that
Board of Rights session without a lawyer.

11:35.277 --> 11:37.988
I had breakfast this morning
with Mike Sullivan.

11:38.072 --> 11:40.950
The Police Protective Association
wants no involvement,

11:41.492 --> 11:44.120
and since you're in arrears,
they figure they've got that right.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.747
Yeah, well, that's just dandy, isn't it?

11:48.249 --> 11:50.376
You tell them
they can take their association

11:50.459 --> 11:51.919
and stuff it, man, hard.

11:52.002 --> 11:54.255
I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to find private counsel.

11:55.506 --> 11:59.468
But Ray and I have made out a list
of very good people for you.

12:01.095 --> 12:04.140
Yeah, well,
I guess I'll see you later, Captain.

12:04.223 --> 12:07.768
Just a second. Your partner, Washington,
he's clean, isn't he?

12:09.145 --> 12:10.896
Yeah. He's clean.

12:10.980 --> 12:14.024
-(paper crumples, hits floor)
-And so am I.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.864
For what it's worth,
I think I believe him, Frank.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.912
You warn those Street Lords
to muzzle up their mouths

12:26.996 --> 12:28.956
until after the president's tour.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.708
They've got an agreement with us.

12:32.334 --> 12:36.464
-Sarge, I need some advice.
-Well, sure, Bobby. What's the problem?

12:36.547 --> 12:38.758
You know that car thief we called in on?

12:38.841 --> 12:42.344
He's outside fixing some patrol cars,
units 17 and 26.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.971
Cowboy's giving him a hand.

12:44.054 --> 12:46.098
The guy's that good a mechanic?

12:46.182 --> 12:47.892
Oh, Sarge, he's amazing.

12:48.684 --> 12:51.520
Well, maybe we oughta have him
take a look at my Buick.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.190
I kinda hate booking the guy,
Sarge, you know?

12:54.273 --> 12:56.776
But we caught him cold,
and the first thing he goes and does

12:56.859 --> 12:59.236
-is he confesses.
-That is a problem, all right.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.696
-Let me think on it.
-Okay.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.823
Oh, Bobby, uh,

13:03.407 --> 13:05.075
here are the keys to my car.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.663
Hey, Hill, my unit's running
a little rough.

13:09.747 --> 13:15.002
-What's the chance of him takin' a look?
-One vehicle at a time, Officer Sneed.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.298
(shouting)

13:19.381 --> 13:22.051
(shouting, chattering loudly)

13:25.221 --> 13:30.976
(both speaking in Spanish)

13:32.144 --> 13:33.854
Good morning, Sergeant.

13:41.028 --> 13:44.323
You know, after our initial fiasco,

13:44.406 --> 13:47.701
I was tempted to call
Chief Daniels, but I didn't.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.246
-I chose not to.
-(clamoring)

13:51.497 --> 13:54.208
Lucy, see what that ruckus
in Booking is all about.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.087
-I'm addressing you, Sergeant.
-Oh. Yes, ma'am?

13:58.170 --> 14:02.633
And I'm warning you,
I'm here on business, and I mean business.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.760
So let's get down to business.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.555
I have provided you with
seven pages of color samples.

14:07.638 --> 14:08.806
Have you looked them over?

14:10.224 --> 14:11.225
I have.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.063
Do you agree or disagree
with my recommendations?

14:26.907 --> 14:28.909
Does that imply displeasure, Sergeant?

14:40.838 --> 14:43.132
-Your captain in?
-Uh, no, sir.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.468
-I think he's on some business downtown.
-That's just dandy.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.263
MAN: (mumbles)

15:08.449 --> 15:09.533
Bates.

15:11.785 --> 15:12.828
Me?

15:13.662 --> 15:18.083
I was wondering if we could have
a little verbal <i>mano a mano?</i>

15:22.630 --> 15:26.550
-A talk.
-Sure. About what?

15:27.635 --> 15:28.802
About you,

15:29.845 --> 15:32.264
me, us.

15:32.890 --> 15:33.891
Us?

15:35.309 --> 15:36.685
Could we, uh...

15:49.490 --> 15:51.408
We live in revolutionary times, Bates,

15:51.492 --> 15:53.869
and all propensities
are falling by the wayside,

15:53.953 --> 15:55.871
if you perceive my drift.

16:01.669 --> 16:02.753
It's empty.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.256
Trust me.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.134
Enough is enough. What's going on?

16:09.218 --> 16:12.554
Privacy, Bates. The walls have ears.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.974
They also have urinals.

16:16.183 --> 16:18.185
Inside, Bates!

16:18.268 --> 16:19.436
Yes, sir.

16:25.442 --> 16:28.904
-Let's get down to it.
-Get down to what?

16:28.988 --> 16:32.324
A 12% raise in pay,
special training, upgrade in rank,

16:32.408 --> 16:33.701
and more action with me

16:33.784 --> 16:35.995
than you'll get in a year
out in that squad room.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.414
Just exactly what are you proposing?

16:38.872 --> 16:42.126
I am proposing you fill a slot

16:42.209 --> 16:44.962
in my Emergency Action Team.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.006
Now what do you say to that?

16:47.923 --> 16:48.966
Wow.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.261
I never envisioned myself an EATer.

16:52.344 --> 16:53.637
I have.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.140
Although I don't endorse that acronym.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.100
Excuse me.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.686
You're aware of the departmental
quota situation:

17:00.769 --> 17:03.022
so many of your basic Latin types,

17:03.105 --> 17:06.066
your black types, uh, your... types.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.236
Female types.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.740
I need you, Bates.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.661
You've got tight-end size
with the hands of a wide receiver

17:17.745 --> 17:21.123
and the body weight
to stand up against the stock of an M16.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.459
You got smart eyes and good abutments,

17:24.001 --> 17:26.795
and, damn it,
I think you've got the guts to make it.

17:29.840 --> 17:30.674
What do you say?

17:35.429 --> 17:36.847
(slams)

17:40.684 --> 17:42.227
Suck in that gut, mister.

17:52.112 --> 17:56.033
Lucy? L-Lucy, what gives?
What's the matter? Huh?

17:56.533 --> 17:58.702
Do I look like a tight end to you?

18:00.120 --> 18:03.540
-Oh, I wouldn't put it in those terms.
-No?

18:03.624 --> 18:07.461
I have observed, however,
on occasion, a...

18:07.544 --> 18:08.796
certain...

18:10.380 --> 18:12.382
muscularity in that vicinity.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.015
-Lucy--
-(sighs)

18:21.141 --> 18:23.852
I meant that in the most
complimentary way.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.647
BATES: I'm sorry.

18:27.397 --> 18:29.066
(voice breaking) It's not your fault.

18:30.484 --> 18:31.527
(sighs)

18:32.820 --> 18:34.446
Please, could I just be alone?

18:34.988 --> 18:37.491
Why, sure. Whatever you say.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.299
Lucy, let me tell you something.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.554
You know, between the time
that Margaret and I separated

18:58.637 --> 19:03.100
and the time that I met Cindy,
there was six or seven days there...

19:03.183 --> 19:06.895
when I seriously considered
asking you for a date.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.610
-No kidding.
-No kidding.

19:14.486 --> 19:18.073
And if it wasn't for the fact
that we share a work environment, I, uh...

19:18.824 --> 19:20.325
well, Lucy, um...

19:21.493 --> 19:24.371
I find you attractive in the extremis.

19:24.454 --> 19:27.416
And I don't respond haphazardly
to just anyone of the op--

19:28.625 --> 19:32.212
Well, I don't, uh,
have a problem in that regard, as it were.

19:33.964 --> 19:34.923
(sighs)

19:36.425 --> 19:38.260
Thank you, Sergeant.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.262
You're okay.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.765
I'm okay. You're okay.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.185
We're okay.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.854
-Okay?
-Okay.

19:59.656 --> 20:04.203
(upbeat instrumental music playing)

20:19.092 --> 20:20.469
-(knocking)
-Who is it?

20:20.552 --> 20:21.595
John LaRue.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.854
-Hi, babe.
-Ooh, don't mess my makeup.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.522
You never give me the chance.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.191
He inside?

20:34.274 --> 20:35.609
-Yeah.
-(quietly) Okay.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.361
(sighs)

20:42.950 --> 20:44.368
(sighs)

20:44.451 --> 20:47.287
-(water running)
-What say, lover?

20:48.580 --> 20:50.123
Going to the hanging in your shorts?

20:53.710 --> 20:54.920
Couldn't say.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.840
Not supposed to be talking to you, man.

21:00.634 --> 21:01.551
I'm a witness.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.054
Internal Affairs tell you that, did they?

21:07.349 --> 21:09.434
-(exhales)
-(water stops)

21:09.518 --> 21:12.354
I really did it to myself
this time, didn't I?

21:13.939 --> 21:16.149
That Macafee suckered me good.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.821
Ah, I don't know.
Maybe I deserve what's coming.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.241
Yeah.

21:25.575 --> 21:26.660
Maybe you do.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.833
Hey, I was trying
to return the money, man.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.044
You gotta believe me.
I was trying not to get you involved.

21:37.254 --> 21:38.964
If you say so, lover.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.968
Hey, you believe me, don't you?

21:45.762 --> 21:47.139
You believe me, don't you, Jill?

21:47.889 --> 21:49.474
Please. I don't know anything.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.647
I'm going in there alone, man,
and I need you with me.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.901
Now you gotta believe me.
That's all I'm asking for.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.029
I'm not asking you
to go in there and lie for me.

22:02.446 --> 22:03.572
Like hell you're not, man.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.407
That's exactly what
you're asking me to do.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.287
(sighs)

22:10.370 --> 22:11.413
(snaps fingers)

22:15.208 --> 22:18.670
MAN (on P.A.): <i>Service, line six.</i>
<i>Service, line six.</i>

22:18.754 --> 22:20.756
(air wrench whirring)

22:20.839 --> 22:23.967
-(man continues, indistinct)
-Hi. Rob around?

22:24.051 --> 22:24.968
-Rob?
-Mm-hmm.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.262
Uh, let me go see. Who should I say is--

22:27.346 --> 22:29.639
-Tell him it's his brother-in-law.
-Oh.

22:30.390 --> 22:32.559
Rob, your brother-in-law is here.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.394
ROB: You're kidding.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.564
Hey-y-y. Hey, hey, hey.

22:37.647 --> 22:39.316
What do you say, guy? What do you say?

22:39.399 --> 22:40.567
Hey, okay. How you doing?

22:40.650 --> 22:43.028
Ah, I'm doing good. Doing good.
Take a look at this.

22:44.237 --> 22:46.615
Quarter-page ad
in the <i>Trib,</i> huh? (chuckles)

22:46.698 --> 22:48.909
Hey, Les,
this is Peggy's big brother, John.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.035
Uh, John the cop.

22:50.118 --> 22:52.913
-Oh, nice to meet you, John the cop.
-Same here.

22:53.747 --> 22:56.708
-Where can we talk?
-Oh, come on. Come on into the office.

22:56.792 --> 22:59.211
-Hold calls a couple of minutes, huh?
-Right.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.677
Funny. You know...

23:08.220 --> 23:11.181
I hear the stories all the time
about cops on the take.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.975
Hey, no, no, no.
Don't misunderstand me, J.D.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.519
I-I didn't mean...

23:15.602 --> 23:16.812
What I mean is...

23:17.979 --> 23:19.064
(scoffs)

23:19.815 --> 23:21.691
(sighs) I don't know what I mean.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.779
It's a bad scene. Bad scene.

23:26.822 --> 23:30.158
-So, what's the worst that could happen?
-I need two-grand retainer, Rob.

23:30.242 --> 23:33.036
-Two grand. You'll get it back.
-You're not answering my question.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.913
-What's the worst that could happen?
-I'm out.

23:34.996 --> 23:37.791
And? If you hire a lawyer,
what's the guarantee you're gonna be in?

23:37.874 --> 23:39.709
Come on, man.
Don't play those games with me.

23:39.793 --> 23:42.963
-I got nine years invested in this job.
-You want my opinion, J.D.?

23:43.046 --> 23:45.549
You're throwing two thou
down the same nine-year hole.

23:45.632 --> 23:48.927
Look. What about it?
Can you see your way clear or not?

23:49.010 --> 23:50.595
Peg would be sleeping a whole lot better

23:50.679 --> 23:53.390
if she knew you were working at something
a little bit more normal.

23:54.349 --> 23:57.060
Listen. Maybe it's a blessing, huh?

23:57.561 --> 24:00.564
Come on. Tell the department to cram it.
Come to work.

24:00.647 --> 24:03.108
Make a little more than you spend
for a change, huh?

24:03.191 --> 24:07.154
Listen, I got a line on a liquor store.
Puerto Rico North. Cash business, J.D.

24:07.237 --> 24:09.406
-What Uncle Sam don't know--
-Hey, I don't think so, huh?

24:09.489 --> 24:11.741
You change your mind about the loan,
you give me a call.

24:11.825 --> 24:14.119
-I gotta go downtown to change.
-Where are you running to?

24:14.202 --> 24:15.829
-Come on. Sit down. Hey!
-(door opens)

24:15.912 --> 24:17.789
J.D.! Hey, wait up, J.D.!

24:17.873 --> 24:21.543
(woman on P.A., indistinct)

24:21.626 --> 24:24.004
Hey! I want you to listen to me, J.D.

24:24.087 --> 24:25.088
Listen.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.883
For your sister's sake
I've been bending over sideways for you.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.177
Don't be a loser all your life, huh?

24:31.761 --> 24:34.473
-Really, man.
-(engine starts, runs)

24:34.556 --> 24:38.268
If not for your sake, then do it for hers.
Peg'd sleep a lot better.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.604
Peg'd sleep a lot better if
you weren't getting it on

24:40.687 --> 24:42.105
with that little cookie in there.

24:43.023 --> 24:47.027
What? You're outta line, John.
You are way outta line.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.196
Sure. Sure I am. And you're full of it.

24:49.279 --> 24:50.947
(tires screech)

24:59.414 --> 25:00.707
Man's a genius.

25:00.790 --> 25:02.834
The light's never worked,
and it never will.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.212
Yeah? I'll take that action, Lamonica.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.880
-MAN: He's a surgeon.
-(grunts)

25:08.548 --> 25:10.383
-(all exclaiming)
-MAN: Let there be light.

25:10.467 --> 25:13.720
-All right.
-Hey! Hey, $10.

25:13.803 --> 25:16.097
-RENKO: Hey!
-LAMONICA: The hell. You didn't say ten.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.682
Pay the man, Cosmo.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.684
You know, it seems a shame
to send him downtown.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.895
We sure could use him around here.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.189
Makes more sense than a decorator.

25:24.272 --> 25:26.024
It's a straight collar, Phil.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.776
The man's an habitual car thief.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.611
Well, that's true. But still--

25:29.694 --> 25:31.488
Look, when he gets a chance,

25:31.571 --> 25:33.990
see if he can fix the john
in the men's room.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.659
It's been running for two years.

25:36.284 --> 25:38.370
I'll get him right on it, Francis.

25:38.453 --> 25:41.122
Hey, Frank, Frank, Frank.
Look at the morning figures.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.457
Look at armed robbery.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.626
It hasn't been this quiet
since the Super Bowl.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.503
-You can thank the president.
-I intend to.

25:46.586 --> 25:48.129
-How's it going, Ray?
-How you doing?

25:48.213 --> 25:49.589
-All right.
-Come on in, Neal.

25:49.673 --> 25:52.342
Uh, Malibu, uh,

25:53.176 --> 25:54.803
I think I'm wearing him down.

25:54.886 --> 25:58.598
Yeah, give it to me straight, Sarge.
What are my chances?

25:59.307 --> 26:01.476
Well, I won't lie to you.
It's, uh... (mumbles)

26:01.560 --> 26:03.311
Hey, I got an idea, okay?

26:03.395 --> 26:06.982
Now, what about letting me
serve my time up here,

26:07.065 --> 26:10.193
sorta like a... like a trustee, right?

26:10.277 --> 26:14.197
I mean, uh, this place needs a lotta work.

26:14.281 --> 26:16.741
If I could, I would, Malibu,
but it's not up to me.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.785
It's up to the courts.

26:18.868 --> 26:21.079
Hey, tell me the truth.

26:21.162 --> 26:23.081
You think I oughta get rid of my Buick?

26:23.915 --> 26:27.252
My girlfriend thinks
I oughta get into something flashier.

26:27.335 --> 26:30.672
See we got the senior prom coming up.
It's a homecoming.

26:30.755 --> 26:34.259
Hmm. Flash is flash, Sarge,

26:34.342 --> 26:39.556
but, from your mechanical standpoint,
she's a solid vehicle.

26:39.639 --> 26:41.600
(chortles)

26:44.227 --> 26:47.564
You sensed something wrong,
yet you didn't ask him about it.

26:48.064 --> 26:49.149
How come?

26:49.858 --> 26:52.819
Well, he's been under a lot
of pressure lately, Captain.

26:52.902 --> 26:54.279
You know how it goes.

26:54.362 --> 26:57.157
No, I don't know how it goes.
What kind of pressure?

26:58.241 --> 26:59.409
Money pressure:

27:01.202 --> 27:03.330
women, clothes...

27:04.623 --> 27:05.790
You know J.D., Captain.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.335
Yeah, well, I thought I did anyway.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.212
Yeah, well, uh...

27:11.296 --> 27:13.214
You know, I had my doubts too, but...

27:14.507 --> 27:15.550
What it is...

27:16.301 --> 27:19.220
if he meant to keep that money,
he would've offered me a split.

27:19.304 --> 27:22.390
-Why? Because it's happened before?
-Nah. No way.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.726
-Hey, wait a minute, Captain--
-No, you wait a minute.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.854
You offer that little piece of logic
to Internal Affairs,

27:27.937 --> 27:29.648
and they're gonna ask the same questions.

27:29.731 --> 27:30.565
(knocking)

27:31.775 --> 27:33.109
(mouths word)

27:33.193 --> 27:35.070
Look, I know you wanna help, Neal,

27:35.153 --> 27:37.322
but I don't want you
dirtied in the process.

27:41.076 --> 27:41.910
What?

27:41.993 --> 27:44.371
That president's man, Parker?
He just called in.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.998
You were right, Francis.
They canceled it. Just like that.

27:47.082 --> 27:49.542
CALLETANO: Some kind of crisis
in the Persian Gulf.

27:49.626 --> 27:52.962
Crisis, all right. Right here.
Get him for me, Ray.

27:53.046 --> 27:55.465
-All right.
-Where's Goldblume?

27:55.548 --> 27:57.592
-With the Secret Service guy.
-No, he's back.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.094
I just saw him go in the john.

27:59.177 --> 28:00.136
Come on, Neal.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.766
-One--
-Parker called. It's off.

28:04.849 --> 28:07.435
We gotta recontact everyone
and tell them we've been suckered.

28:07.519 --> 28:08.937
(groaning, chattering)

28:09.020 --> 28:12.190
That's two years' credibility,
damn it! I'll get right on it.

28:12.273 --> 28:14.275
I can't get him.
He's not takin' any calls.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.944
Especially not ours. Keep trying.

28:16.027 --> 28:18.571
If you get him,
patch him through to Internal Affairs.

28:18.655 --> 28:19.781
(chattering)

28:19.864 --> 28:22.492
Given your penchant for lavatories here,
gentlemen,

28:22.575 --> 28:25.578
there are 16 sets of them up
in St. James Park,

28:25.662 --> 28:28.498
along with 12 unsolved rape/assaults.

28:28.581 --> 28:30.625
-Come on, Neal.
-MALIBU: Captain?

28:31.960 --> 28:34.045
This John is pathetic.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.923
I mean, this stuff must be 50 years old.

28:38.425 --> 28:42.178
-Fixable?
-For a normal person, no.

28:42.262 --> 28:45.557
But, uh, with some new parts, uh...

28:46.558 --> 28:48.393
Sergeant will send someone.

28:48.476 --> 28:51.271
-Tell them what you want.
-10-4, Captain.

28:53.022 --> 28:54.023
Right.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.575
(exhales)

29:07.162 --> 29:08.621
(door bangs open)

29:13.251 --> 29:14.461
GUARD: Okay.

29:16.921 --> 29:19.382
(ratcheting)

29:20.008 --> 29:21.718
Sit down... there.

29:25.722 --> 29:28.683
(tapping phone keys)

29:30.310 --> 29:31.936
GUARD: Check-in, 117.

29:33.188 --> 29:34.397
Who's this? Alice?

29:36.566 --> 29:41.070
I had the, uh, coke buyer
under surveillance for about three weeks.

29:42.113 --> 29:45.283
At the same time, ironically,
I started getting static off the street

29:45.366 --> 29:46.868
about this Hill Street narc.

29:47.535 --> 29:50.371
-MAN: Detective John LaRue?
-MACAFEE: Yeah. That's right. LaRue.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.625
The snitch told me that
he's shaking down dealers

29:53.708 --> 29:55.418
all over the precinct.

29:55.502 --> 29:58.880
MAN: Well, then why didn't you
report it immediately?

29:58.963 --> 30:01.341
Anything that dirty,
I thought I'd better look into,

30:01.424 --> 30:02.842
to see what I was up against.

30:03.760 --> 30:07.680
And, bam, LaRue and his partner
jump my bust just as it's coming down.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.935
He put a gun to my face,
so I surrendered the money.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.772
Where was Detective Washington?

30:15.855 --> 30:17.607
He stayed with the suspect, sir.

30:18.274 --> 30:20.026
MAN: Leaving you and LaRue alone.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.279
To the bes... I... To the best of my know.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.739
I mean, I didn't see him.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.659
MAN: Then LaRue told you to pretend
you escaped. Is that right?

30:27.742 --> 30:28.827
That's right.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.871
MAN: Was there any indication

30:31.955 --> 30:35.250
of any collusion between
Washington and LaRue?

30:36.876 --> 30:39.003
Mm, no. I don't think so.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.631
But, uh...

30:43.007 --> 30:44.884
I wouldn't overlook any possibility.

30:50.723 --> 30:52.934
Clarify something for me, Macafee.

30:53.768 --> 30:56.479
Why do you suppose LaRue,
after he took the money,

30:57.522 --> 30:58.940
let you walk away?

30:59.774 --> 31:02.026
He put a bit of a scare into me, Frank.

31:03.194 --> 31:06.698
He said that there wasn't
a plainclothes cop on the Hill

31:06.781 --> 31:08.533
that wasn't somehow involved.

31:08.616 --> 31:11.369
-Those were his words.
-And you believed him?

31:13.246 --> 31:16.416
It must have been pretty convincing
or I would be one dead mick.

31:18.376 --> 31:22.005
This, um, source of yours,

31:22.088 --> 31:23.381
who told you about LaRue.

31:23.965 --> 31:25.091
Can he be produced?

31:25.592 --> 31:26.634
He's dead.

31:28.553 --> 31:31.097
Word on the street
is that LaRue got wind of it and...

31:32.682 --> 31:33.516
did him.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.685
-This is hearsay.
-No, no, no.

31:35.768 --> 31:37.854
No, no, no.
It's within the guidelines, Frank.

31:37.937 --> 31:40.982
Now he's going into a Board of Rights,
not a courtroom.

31:41.065 --> 31:42.525
Not yet anyway.

31:48.948 --> 31:49.991
(door opens)

31:53.786 --> 31:55.121
FURILLO: Your turn, Neal.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.629
-Macafee's lying.
-You believe me now.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.797
Yes, I believe you.

32:04.881 --> 32:07.592
But he's good.
They're eating it up in there.

32:08.301 --> 32:09.135
Listen to me.

32:09.218 --> 32:11.262
No matter what they say,
whatever they threaten you with,

32:11.346 --> 32:13.389
even if they remand you
to the district attorney,

32:13.473 --> 32:16.476
I want you to keep your mouth shut
till I find you a lawyer.

32:16.559 --> 32:18.937
-(phone rings)
-Hello. Captain Furillo's office.

32:19.020 --> 32:21.814
-Yeah, what's happening?
-They're going to war, Francis.

32:21.898 --> 32:24.609
The Street Lords have hit the Blood.
Three D.O.A.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.235
We got units in pursuit.

32:26.319 --> 32:28.988
They're mad at us, Francis.
They think we sold them out.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.574
Tearing up treaties left and right.

32:31.658 --> 32:34.035
(shouting, chattering loudly)

32:34.118 --> 32:35.870
Hardware. Eight pieces.

32:44.879 --> 32:48.633
All right. I got one kid D.O.A.
I got one--(indistinct)

32:48.716 --> 32:52.971
No, man. You're all gonna bleed!
I got a hundred...

32:53.054 --> 32:56.224
You hear me? You hear me, sucker?

32:56.307 --> 32:58.601
(shouting, chattering continue)

33:01.062 --> 33:03.398
MAN: I oughta dice you up, man!

33:03.481 --> 33:06.609
Get him in there. Move out the way.
Move out the way. Let him down.

33:08.778 --> 33:09.904
Oh, yeah?

33:11.948 --> 33:15.868
Yeah, you're all gonna get machine gunned
through the teeth, you hear me?

33:16.869 --> 33:18.621
You'd dig Malibu, man.

33:18.705 --> 33:22.375
They got girl dogs
all up and down the beaches:

33:22.458 --> 33:25.294
French poodles,
Irish setters, Great Danes...

33:25.378 --> 33:27.797
Whatever you're into, man. It's all there.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.299
(tank cover rattles)

33:32.719 --> 33:35.304
What have we here, Shep? Huh?

33:36.347 --> 33:38.891
-Look at this.
-(wood clattering)

33:38.975 --> 33:41.894
Isn't this nice, huh?

33:42.437 --> 33:46.941
Let's see if old Malibu
can fit through this little place.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.236
(straining)

33:51.362 --> 33:54.365
Ooh, yes. (chuckles)

34:00.288 --> 34:02.707
Hey, Shep, be cool, okay,

34:02.790 --> 34:05.668
and, uh, I'll catch up
with you on the outside.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.879
(wood clattering)

34:21.434 --> 34:23.728
Thanks for the detour, Counselor.

34:23.811 --> 34:27.356
DAVENPORT: Well, when Frank Furillo
says "urgent," it's gotta be.

34:27.440 --> 34:31.110
What's the emergency?
You, uh, aren't suggesting...

34:31.194 --> 34:34.947
we recall our high school
physics in the backseat of this thing?

34:35.031 --> 34:37.158
-(chuckles)
-Thought did cross my mind.

34:37.784 --> 34:40.620
Oh. Well, I will, if you will.

34:40.703 --> 34:42.497
You sure are in a good mood today.

34:42.580 --> 34:45.249
Mm, you don't know the half of it, pal.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.753
How about an hour at the Regency Court?

34:48.836 --> 34:50.213
Joyce's treat.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.507
Don't I wish.

34:53.966 --> 34:55.760
Guess we scratch that project.

34:56.427 --> 34:59.013
I suppose the precinct's
in flames for a change.

35:00.389 --> 35:02.433
One of my guys is on the rack.

35:02.517 --> 35:05.394
-Which one?
-John LaRue.

35:07.730 --> 35:08.898
LaRue, huh?

35:10.108 --> 35:12.068
Why does unwanted entry come to mind?

35:12.151 --> 35:13.611
Will you just talk to him?

35:13.694 --> 35:16.197
Internal Affairs
is recommending prosecution.

35:16.781 --> 35:19.158
That's a little stiff, isn't it?
I thought you people

35:19.242 --> 35:21.619
-washed your own dirty linen.
-Will you talk to him?

35:22.912 --> 35:25.665
I'm a public defender.
I represent the indigent.

35:25.748 --> 35:28.918
-John LaRue is not--
-Is indigent. He's in hock up to his eyes.

35:29.001 --> 35:31.587
-And he's innocent.
- Of this, maybe.

35:31.671 --> 35:32.839
But innocent?

35:32.922 --> 35:34.757
Let me tell you about
him crawling up my leg.

35:34.841 --> 35:38.094
You did. Just hear him out.
Let me set it up.

35:41.013 --> 35:43.391
We made a deal
when we started seeing each other:

35:43.975 --> 35:45.560
No business favors.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.855
Your idea, as I recall.

35:50.064 --> 35:51.983
-I'm sorry.
-Well...

35:53.025 --> 35:55.444
at least think about it, will you?

35:55.528 --> 35:57.405
-(chuckles)
-I'll call you tonight.

35:57.488 --> 36:00.575
Mm. It's, uh...

36:02.368 --> 36:03.703
symphony night.

36:03.786 --> 36:05.413
I'll call you after the symphony.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.291
-Late supper.
-Who with?

36:10.459 --> 36:14.297
This, uh, cop I know.

36:17.717 --> 36:20.303
(footsteps departing)

36:23.472 --> 36:25.641
War's breaking out
all over the precinct, Frank,

36:25.725 --> 36:26.934
and that's not the all of it.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.520
<i>We think the Blood hit that</i>
<i>Delgado's Sporting Goods store</i>

36:29.604 --> 36:30.980
<i>over on 135th Street.</i>

36:31.063 --> 36:33.232
They're gonna retaliate like hell.

36:33.316 --> 36:36.777
And I am a little nervous
about having Rene Pagano in here.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.947
-They're crazed to get even, Frank.
-How many guns they get?

36:40.031 --> 36:43.951
A good... 250 and a showcase full of ammo.

36:45.453 --> 36:48.289
Okay. One more stop,
and I'll be back up there.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.750
What's the word off the street?
Who's wearing war colors?

36:50.833 --> 36:54.378
Actually, that's what's so weird, Frank.
I mean, there's no word, no colors.

36:54.462 --> 36:58.257
-It just happened. It's like Vietnam.
-Is that Frank on the line?

36:59.926 --> 37:01.636
Uh, Frank, it's Hunter.

37:02.303 --> 37:05.681
Be soothing, Henry.
Don't raise his blood pressure.

37:06.974 --> 37:09.685
-Hello, Howard.
-Hello, Henry.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.521
Frank, this is Hunter.

37:12.605 --> 37:15.650
I am in your squad room,
and I must say I am appalled.

37:16.108 --> 37:17.860
What's appalling you, Howard?

37:18.319 --> 37:21.364
Frank, Ray Calletano
tells me that he received a telephone call

37:21.447 --> 37:23.074
from the Street Lords youth gang.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.826
They wanna know
what the bail is on their head honcho,

37:25.910 --> 37:27.828
uh, Rene Pagano.

37:27.912 --> 37:31.624
When Ray explained the facts of life,
there were serious threats,

37:31.707 --> 37:33.417
like, if we try to take him downtown,

37:33.501 --> 37:35.670
they're gonna hit us
with a thousand crack troops.

37:36.712 --> 37:39.006
Gotta give them credit
for imagination, Howard.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.424
A thousand troops?

37:40.508 --> 37:43.052
Frank, I wouldn't minimize the danger.

37:43.135 --> 37:45.805
They mentioned Cuban mercenaries
from Lesker Avenue.

37:46.722 --> 37:48.516
Sounds like Mickey Rojas.

37:48.599 --> 37:51.602
I know the kid, Howard.
He's playing games.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.729
Well, if you know him, Frank, for--

37:54.689 --> 37:57.108
Judas Priest, we have
taken enough verbal abuse

37:57.191 --> 37:58.609
from these little cockroaches.

37:58.693 --> 38:01.821
I say it is high time
that you stop letting them make a fool

38:01.904 --> 38:04.240
-of you and put your foot down.
-Sure. Teach them a lesson.

38:04.323 --> 38:05.449
Protective reaction strike.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.410
-Why don't you hit them with napalm?
-Stow it, mister.

38:07.493 --> 38:09.245
You never understood napalm
and you never will.

38:09.328 --> 38:11.455
That's where you are wrong, Hunter.
I do understand napalm.

38:11.539 --> 38:14.750
-You can't use napalm--
-Napalm... Napalm is an intimidating...

38:14.834 --> 38:17.003
<i>-weapon!</i>
<i>-What are the three principles of napalm?</i>

38:17.086 --> 38:19.547
-Henry, what's going on in there?
-HUNTER: <i>"Burn, baby, burn."</i>

38:19.630 --> 38:20.965
<i>-That's your answer.</i>
-Henry!

38:21.048 --> 38:23.884
-(Hunter, Goldblume arguing on the phone)
-(handset hits cradle)

38:28.472 --> 38:29.473
What's the final word?

38:29.557 --> 38:31.559
It's going to the D.A.
to consider prosecution.

38:31.642 --> 38:34.186
Don't panic. We expected that.

38:34.729 --> 38:36.856
I'm setting a meeting up
with a lawyer for tonight.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.108
-Who?
-One of the best.

38:39.734 --> 38:41.360
-Go find a gym and work out--
-(scoffs)

38:41.444 --> 38:43.821
then go home and go to sleep.

38:43.904 --> 38:46.574
That's an order.
I want you with me, Neal. Let's go.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.075
Okay, Cap.

38:48.159 --> 38:51.245
You be cool, babe.
And do what the man says.

39:00.087 --> 39:03.257
Yo, pig face,
gonna torch this pig house tonight.

39:03.341 --> 39:06.093
Gonna open your ugly mouth
and pour gasoline down your throat

39:06.177 --> 39:07.470
and light your tongue!

39:07.553 --> 39:11.557
<i>♪ Mr. Sandman send me a dream... ♪</i>

39:11.640 --> 39:13.434
(humming)

39:15.895 --> 39:16.937
Sign it.

39:19.023 --> 39:22.234
Who is this talking?
Identify yourself, man.

39:22.318 --> 39:24.445
-More threats?
-I'm warning you!

39:25.488 --> 39:27.823
-Craziness.
-Belker just checked in.

39:27.907 --> 39:30.701
Says it's a no-man's-land
out there. Empty streets.

39:30.785 --> 39:33.412
-No word about those 250 guns?
-Zilch.

39:33.496 --> 39:35.915
I got this uneasy feeling
in my gall bladder.

39:37.291 --> 39:39.251
-MAN: What happened?
-Hey!

39:39.335 --> 39:40.586
Correct my thinking.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.964
How hard is it for one
of those monkeys to climb a pole

39:44.048 --> 39:45.299
and cut the power?

39:45.383 --> 39:46.801
Cut the power? What for?

39:46.884 --> 39:48.803
Well, they've been
threatening all afternoon.

39:48.886 --> 39:51.180
We must be having some kind
of power outage, Sergeant.

39:51.263 --> 39:54.141
-Shut up.
-(shouting)

39:54.225 --> 39:55.976
All right. You gonna die.
Every one of you.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.145
-COP: I got you!
-Get off me, sucker!

39:58.229 --> 40:00.064
Hey, you know what it's like to be dead?

40:00.147 --> 40:03.359
Because you're gonna die!
I'm gonna kill every one of you!

40:03.442 --> 40:06.821
(shouting, chattering loudly)

40:06.904 --> 40:10.116
I'm gonna light it!
Get your hands off me, sucker!

40:13.035 --> 40:15.913
-MAN: Phone's dead. Something is going on.
-Hey, Sneed, try the phones.

40:15.996 --> 40:18.582
-MAN 2: I think they're all dead.
-(clicking phone cradle)

40:18.666 --> 40:20.709
-Line's dead.
-No dial tone.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.213
-This sucker's dead too.
-The phones are dead.

40:24.296 --> 40:27.133
Listen up, everyone. The phones are dead.

40:27.216 --> 40:30.761
Okay. Thank you, Alf. Listen.
Before anyone goes off the deep end,

40:30.845 --> 40:32.638
suppose we check out the terminal box.

40:32.721 --> 40:35.015
-Ray, where's the terminal?
-Good question.

40:35.099 --> 40:38.018
-Okay. Call a repairman.
-With what? The phones are dead.

40:38.102 --> 40:41.647
We're under siege. Ray,
you're ranking officer here.

40:44.525 --> 40:48.112
I want your attention.
This could be an emergency situation.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.364
So let's secure those windows and doors.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.992
Cosmo, move those desks, and
let's barricade the corridor

40:53.075 --> 40:56.871
-and put some cover over here.
-(chattering)

41:00.624 --> 41:02.168
BATES: Don't anybody panic!

41:02.251 --> 41:04.628
I need eight volunteers
for a perimeter check.

41:05.212 --> 41:06.839
Only single men under 35.

41:06.922 --> 41:10.176
-That leaves you out, Sarge.
-You're not sending people outside, Ray?

41:10.259 --> 41:12.052
That's how we did it in the marine corps.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.263
They could get killed out there.
This is not the marines.

41:14.346 --> 41:17.266
Let's radio Division
from one of the units in the parking lot.

41:17.349 --> 41:18.601
What about our backup system?

41:18.684 --> 41:20.644
Are you crazy? That thing
hasn't worked in years.

41:20.728 --> 41:23.314
You can't send people outside.

41:24.106 --> 41:27.067
I'll go. Henry, you are in charge.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.819
Oh, wonderful. What's he doing?

41:28.903 --> 41:30.905
Ray? What do you think you're doing?

41:30.988 --> 41:33.199
Cover him, you guys. He's going outside.

41:33.908 --> 41:36.076
-MAN: All right.
-MAN 2: Take it easy.

41:38.787 --> 41:40.581
-Cover him. Cover him.
-All right.

41:44.919 --> 41:47.296
-MAN: Keep down over there.
-(chatter continues)

41:49.840 --> 41:50.966
MAN: Where is he now?

41:53.886 --> 41:56.931
(whispering) I just want you to know
that if anything happens,

41:57.431 --> 41:59.475
it's been great serving with you, Lucy.

41:59.558 --> 42:01.936
Thanks, Willy.
Feel the same way about you.

42:02.019 --> 42:04.480
Feel a lot better if you took your hand
out from under my skirt.

42:04.563 --> 42:06.273
PAGANO: Everybody, I'm gonna get you...

42:06.357 --> 42:09.652
(all chanting) And you and you and you

42:09.735 --> 42:11.987
and you and your mama!

42:12.071 --> 42:14.281
-(shouting, chattering)
-SNEED: Shut up, you guys.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.618
-(chattering, taunting)
-Cut that mouth over there!

42:23.457 --> 42:25.709
-Sergeant--
-Paint it any way you want, Mrs. Gardner.

42:25.793 --> 42:27.753
I don't care anymore. I'm retiring.

42:28.504 --> 42:31.924
I've never heard of precinct houses
coming under attack before.

42:32.007 --> 42:34.301
(laughs) I've never heard of such a thing.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.220
-MAN: How's he doing?
-MAN 2: He's made it to the parking lot.

42:36.303 --> 42:38.264
Neither have I, Mrs. Gardner.

42:38.347 --> 42:41.308
What is happening to our society,
Sergeant?

42:42.685 --> 42:44.103
(shell clatters)

42:44.186 --> 42:45.938
Isn't there somebody else we could call?

42:46.021 --> 42:49.024
He's in the car.
He's making radio contact with Division.

42:49.108 --> 42:53.404
Sergeant, just hold me.
Oh, please, hold me. (sighs)

42:53.487 --> 42:56.907
-(quietly) Oh. Oh.
-(sighs)

42:57.908 --> 42:59.577
MAN: Shh. Stay down.

42:59.660 --> 43:00.828
MAN 2: What's happening?

43:01.620 --> 43:03.080
There's cars outside, Henry!

43:03.163 --> 43:05.791
-(chattering)
-Excuse me, Mrs. Gardner.

43:05.874 --> 43:09.878
(wood creaking, cracking)

43:09.962 --> 43:12.339
They're coming through the roof.
Cover that ceiling.

43:12.423 --> 43:15.926
-MAN: Somebody's up there.
-Hey, there's someone out front, Sarge!

43:16.010 --> 43:18.762
-(chattering continues)
-Cover the door. It's locked, isn't it?

43:20.973 --> 43:22.558
LAMONICA: They're coming in!

43:23.100 --> 43:25.853
-(door opens)
-You mean, no one locked the door?

43:28.188 --> 43:30.149
-MAN: It's the captain.
-MAN 2: It's Furillo!

43:30.232 --> 43:32.943
-WOMAN: Get him in here.
-MAN: Whew!

43:33.485 --> 43:34.695
MAN: Stay down.

43:35.237 --> 43:38.032
Francis? You shouldn't be
driving around out there.

43:38.115 --> 43:40.034
How else was I supposed to get here?

43:43.287 --> 43:44.705
MAN: Comin' through up here.

43:44.788 --> 43:46.832
(plaster crumbling)

43:48.542 --> 43:51.629
What the hell is this?
What's going on here?

43:51.712 --> 43:53.505
What's he doing in the ceiling?

43:53.589 --> 43:55.924
MALIBU: Don't let no one start
getting physical, okay, man?

43:56.008 --> 43:59.011
Because I confess.
I was making a breakout, right,

43:59.094 --> 44:03.223
when I see that your main junction
is wired all wrong, man!

44:03.307 --> 44:04.892
So I had to fix it, right?

44:04.975 --> 44:06.769
And then your phones, man!

44:06.852 --> 44:09.229
Your phones, they had them
held together with spit.

44:09.313 --> 44:12.983
And, uh... and that's when I got
my foot stuck in the rafters.

44:14.193 --> 44:17.821
Get this mess cleaned up.
Use the phone in my office.

44:17.905 --> 44:18.989
They're out, Frank.

44:19.073 --> 44:21.283
-They gotta be reconnected.
-I take full responsibility.

44:21.367 --> 44:23.118
It'll take me 12 seconds
to fix the whole thing.

44:23.202 --> 44:24.995
Really. I was almost finished anyways.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.206
Well, as soon as they're connected,

44:27.873 --> 44:30.376
I think we've figured out
a presidential solution.

44:30.459 --> 44:33.128
-Call a summit meeting for 8:00.
-Right, Frank.

44:33.212 --> 44:35.964
-RAY: Frank.
-Yes, Ray.

44:37.216 --> 44:38.509
You had to be here.

44:42.388 --> 44:43.764
How 'bout a lift?

44:47.810 --> 44:48.894
Wow.

44:50.270 --> 44:52.064
You saved my life.

44:52.648 --> 44:54.733
MAN: Ah! Got a friend, babe.

44:54.817 --> 44:57.236
-(laughs) Got a friend, babe.
-(others hooting)

44:57.319 --> 45:00.030
(static, oscillating on radio)

45:00.114 --> 45:02.324
You know, what I gotta do...

45:02.408 --> 45:05.953
is take this, put it into here.

45:06.036 --> 45:10.374
-Just put this--
-(gang applauding)

45:10.457 --> 45:12.668
Ah! The man is another Thomas Edison.

45:12.751 --> 45:14.128
I know, man.

45:14.211 --> 45:17.423
-I'm incredible.
-Tell me that after you fix the ceiling.

45:17.506 --> 45:18.882
10-4, Captain.

45:21.510 --> 45:25.180
-(oscillating on radio)
-(switches clicking)

45:28.392 --> 45:30.769
(phone rings)

45:30.853 --> 45:33.063
Yes? They're all here.

45:33.147 --> 45:36.275
It'll just take us a moment to connect
the loudspeaker system.

45:37.276 --> 45:38.360
Thank you, sir.

45:40.696 --> 45:43.282
MAN (on P.A.): <i>I put the big ixnay</i>
<i>on that one, good buddy.</i>

45:43.365 --> 45:45.325
<i>I told her, "Don't cry</i>
<i>down my back, honey.</i>

45:45.409 --> 45:48.537
<i>-You might rust my spurs."</i>
-(gang laughing)

45:50.038 --> 45:53.375
Sorry, man. Uh, sometimes
this unit picks up C.B.

45:53.459 --> 45:56.754
(oscillating continues)

45:56.837 --> 45:57.838
Okay.

45:58.839 --> 46:01.717
Gentlemen, the next voice you hear

46:01.800 --> 46:04.887
will be the President
of the United States.

46:06.972 --> 46:08.348
Go ahead, Mr. President.

46:14.271 --> 46:18.108
<i>-(Man On P.A., indistinct)</i>
-(exhales)

46:19.985 --> 46:23.572
It's a working dinner, pussy willow,

46:24.156 --> 46:26.074
with the police decorator.

46:38.045 --> 46:39.213
Uh...

46:41.381 --> 46:45.177
Come on, Cindy.
We'll go formal shopping tomorrow night.

46:54.478 --> 46:56.313
(chuckles)

46:56.396 --> 46:59.650
(Davenport laughing)

46:59.733 --> 47:01.944
(sighs)

47:03.070 --> 47:04.571
Malibu.

47:04.655 --> 47:05.989
I think I love him.

47:06.990 --> 47:08.617
What finally happened?

47:08.700 --> 47:11.119
Well, in all the confusion,
we lost the booking slip.

47:11.203 --> 47:14.623
And you can't keep him forever.
You gotta book him or let him go, so...

47:14.706 --> 47:17.042
-So you let him go.
-Heck, no.

47:18.669 --> 47:21.797
We rebooked him on additional
charges of attempted escape

47:21.880 --> 47:23.590
and malicious vandalism.

47:23.674 --> 47:25.551
(laughing) Ah, you didn't.

47:25.634 --> 47:29.263
It's a dog-eat-dog world, Counselor,
and no dog's gonna eat me.

47:30.097 --> 47:32.891
He probably saved you
over a thousand dollars

47:32.975 --> 47:34.768
in mechanical repairs.

47:35.352 --> 47:38.438
Typical cop gratitude, Furillo.
You're all heart.

47:39.022 --> 47:42.526
I'll make a deal with you, Counselor,
what you might call a plea bargain.

47:43.443 --> 47:46.363
You reconsider taking LaRue's case,

47:47.322 --> 47:49.658
and I'll consider dropping Malibu's.

47:50.200 --> 47:53.203
-Uh-huh. (laughs)
-What's so funny?

47:53.871 --> 47:56.915
You are, pizza man.
You did let him go, didn't you?

47:56.999 --> 47:58.166
Yeah.

47:59.042 --> 48:02.504
But he promised to come back tomorrow
and repair the ceiling.

48:02.588 --> 48:05.299
(laughs)

48:05.382 --> 48:07.384
(sighs) You're a softy after all.

48:07.467 --> 48:08.719
Sometimes.

48:10.971 --> 48:11.972
What about LaRue?

48:12.556 --> 48:15.767
Aren't you afraid I might be
seduced by his charms?

48:15.851 --> 48:17.853
I'll take my chances.

48:17.936 --> 48:19.187
Hmm. (gasps)

48:19.271 --> 48:21.064
-Oop! Here, let me...
-Oh...

48:23.442 --> 48:25.319
Be... careful.

48:25.944 --> 48:28.155
Well, if you can't trust
an Italian with a razor,

48:28.238 --> 48:29.323
who can you trust?

48:32.200 --> 48:35.287
Oh! Now... Now, just don't move.

48:36.663 --> 48:38.290
Just hold very still.

48:38.373 --> 48:40.542
(Davenport laughing)

48:44.421 --> 48:46.465
(music plays)
