00:03.049 --> 00:05.885
<i>(whooshing)</i>

00:26.948 --> 00:29.034
<i>(thud)</i>

00:29.200 --> 00:32.412
- Is it safe?
- Yes, the chamber has been sealed.

00:32.579 --> 00:36.041
- Where are the others?
- The Brotherhood has fallen, Astrum.

00:36.207 --> 00:38.710
- We're all that remains.
- My God.

00:38.877 --> 00:40.920
<i>- If we die, then...
- (whooshing)</i>

00:41.087 --> 00:43.715
Hurry. They're getting closer.

01:04.152 --> 01:06.237
Allina, I know I've said this before,

01:06.404 --> 01:10.283
but thank you for letting us in here,
helping us through the material.

01:10.450 --> 01:12.535
It's been utterly fascinating.

01:12.702 --> 01:17.165
I'm happy to do it, Doctor.
I'm sorry this information is so scattered.

01:17.332 --> 01:20.960
I'm afraid we're working
on so many projects at once,

01:21.127 --> 01:23.672
reference materials tend to get misplaced.

01:23.838 --> 01:27.133
Of course. Look at that.

01:27.300 --> 01:28.927
<i>(laughter)</i>

01:37.477 --> 01:40.397
- What is going on here?
- Just having a little fun.

01:40.563 --> 01:42.232
Can we get back to work?

01:42.399 --> 01:46.194
I don't see how running through
history books will find us our ZPM.

01:46.361 --> 01:48.780
Really? See this?

01:48.947 --> 01:51.700
This is a charcoal rubbing
from an Ancient temple

01:51.866 --> 01:53.785
built when Weir's list was written.

01:53.952 --> 01:58.456
Notice anything familiar? Hm? It's a ZPM.

01:58.623 --> 02:01.334
We are close.
Closer than we have ever been.

02:01.501 --> 02:05.046
There may be hundreds
of zero-point modules in this galaxy,

02:05.213 --> 02:09.592
but the only one
we are remotely sure of is here. Here.

02:09.758 --> 02:12.137
Now, if you ever want to go home,

02:12.303 --> 02:17.767
if you ever want to protect Atlantis
from the Wraith, we need to find this.

03:27.253 --> 03:29.673
Do they have any idea
where the ZPM could be?

03:29.839 --> 03:32.634
An Ancient from Atlantis
came through the Stargate

03:32.801 --> 03:36.638
and entrusted a sect of Sudarian priests
with a rare treasure,

03:36.805 --> 03:38.890
or Potentia, as they called it.

03:39.057 --> 03:41.810
This Lantian told them
to hide it from the Wraith.

03:41.976 --> 03:44.229
The Sudarian people
worshiped the Ancients

03:44.396 --> 03:47.857
and considered the Potentia
their most sacred artefact.

03:48.024 --> 03:50.151
They did as the Ancient requested.

03:50.318 --> 03:53.363
- The Potentia being...
- The ZPM.

03:53.530 --> 03:55.198
They wouldn't have used it?

03:55.365 --> 03:58.326
I think they only displayed it
on high holidays.

03:58.493 --> 04:01.246
I'd be surprised if they knew
it could be used.

04:01.413 --> 04:04.833
If they didn't know how to use it,
chances are it's still full.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.294
The bad news is that
after 10,000 years of Wraith culling,

04:08.461 --> 04:10.213
Sudarian society is extinct.

04:10.380 --> 04:13.883
The planet's inhabitants are at
a Renaissance level of development,

04:14.050 --> 04:16.386
but with help
they could make some headway.

04:16.553 --> 04:20.890
All right. I'm sold.
Major, take your team back to Dagan.

04:21.057 --> 04:23.018
Try to get us a ticket home.

04:44.456 --> 04:46.541
Does it still pain you?

04:49.377 --> 04:52.464
Leave us.

04:57.552 --> 05:01.806
- What do you have for me?
- The Atlanteans have returned to Dagan.

05:01.973 --> 05:05.477
- You're sure?
- Oh, yes. Our operative just checked in.

05:05.643 --> 05:10.357
It's only been 12 hours since they left.
They must be getting close to it.

05:10.523 --> 05:14.277
- Do we have any idea what "it" is yet?
- We know a little more.

05:14.444 --> 05:19.282
Our offworld spies have been keeping
an eye on the Atlantean teams from afar,

05:19.449 --> 05:22.660
but this is the first planet
we've got this close to them.

05:23.828 --> 05:26.706
They're looking for
a Lantian-era power source.

05:28.750 --> 05:34.464
- Is Chief Cowen sending a team?
- Not yet. His priorities are elsewhere.

05:34.631 --> 05:38.134
Even if he was,
he would never send you.

05:40.261 --> 05:43.139
The last thing the Atlanteans need
is more power.

05:43.306 --> 05:46.893
Get me on that planet,
with or without Cowen's blessing.

05:47.060 --> 05:49.354
I don't know why, but it stopped working.

05:49.521 --> 05:52.899
I got some of the functionality back,
but not everything.

05:53.066 --> 05:56.486
Maybe if people stop insisting
on having food and liquid

05:56.653 --> 05:58.697
close to 10,000-year-old equipment...

05:58.863 --> 06:01.032
Hey, we're very careful.

06:01.199 --> 06:04.285
- We're not the problem here.
- Ah. Yes. Uh-huh.

06:15.005 --> 06:17.674
- What did you touch?
- I didn't touch anything.

06:17.841 --> 06:20.260
<i>(speaking Czech)</i>

06:22.929 --> 06:25.015
Then why is it...?

06:31.229 --> 06:33.606
What is this?

06:33.773 --> 06:36.943
- I didn't know we had deep space sensors.
- No one did.

06:37.110 --> 06:41.448
They've been running in the background
along with our other primary systems.

06:41.614 --> 06:44.826
In the background?
Why the sudden leap to the foreground?

06:44.993 --> 06:47.203
Excellent question.

06:47.370 --> 06:51.041
- We don't have an answer yet, do we?
- Not as of yet, no.

06:51.207 --> 06:55.086
- OK, well, keep me in the loop.
- You are the loop.

06:55.253 --> 06:57.339
Isn't that a nice thing to say?

07:01.134 --> 07:03.595
You're more than welcome
to walk with me,

07:03.762 --> 07:07.682
- but if there's something you need to do...
- Yes. Yes.

07:09.601 --> 07:11.936
They called themselves the Quindosim,

07:12.103 --> 07:14.647
a brotherhood of 15 monks
whose sole occupation

07:14.814 --> 07:17.609
was to keep the Potentia, or ZPM, safe.

07:17.776 --> 07:21.071
- It's fascinating.
- Yes. Fascinating.

07:21.863 --> 07:23.323
Please go on.

07:23.490 --> 07:26.868
The Brotherhood of the 15
consisted of a Master Handler,

07:27.035 --> 07:29.287
five Protectors, and nine Stone Carriers.

07:29.454 --> 07:31.790
Their greatest fear
was that the Brotherhood

07:31.956 --> 07:34.042
might one day be culled by the Wraith,

07:34.209 --> 07:36.753
with the ZPM going missing for ever.

07:36.920 --> 07:40.048
Missing, yes, but it would not
fall into enemy hands.

07:40.215 --> 07:42.759
They were entrusted with the ZPM.

07:42.926 --> 07:46.638
Their hope was that one day
the Lantians would return to reclaim it

07:46.805 --> 07:49.307
and reward the Sudarians for their work.

07:49.474 --> 07:52.560
So they left clues,
should the Brotherhood be destroyed.

07:52.727 --> 07:56.690
That's right.
The priests created nine stone markers

07:56.856 --> 07:59.025
that, if united, are supposed to reveal

07:59.192 --> 08:01.903
the resting place
of the Quindosim's treasure.

08:02.070 --> 08:04.614
So far, we've only found three.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.203
The etching on the rocks
involved many lines and dots.

08:10.370 --> 08:13.415
- We think it's a map.
- Mm. Amazing.

08:13.581 --> 08:17.252
It is, actually. This looks like
an Ancient numbering system.

08:17.419 --> 08:18.878
That's what we thought.

08:19.045 --> 08:21.840
We think they're numbers
three, six, and seven.

08:22.007 --> 08:27.387
- Excellent work. I'm very impressed here.
- That's very kind of you, Doctor.

08:28.513 --> 08:32.142
- Where did you find them?
- This building was their monastery.

08:32.308 --> 08:34.936
We pieced together
the information we found here

08:35.102 --> 08:37.355
and found
the number six and seven stones.

08:37.522 --> 08:40.900
We found the number three stone
on an unrelated dig last week.

08:41.067 --> 08:44.821
- If we find the stones, we find the map?
- Yes, exactly.

08:46.114 --> 08:50.910
- Hm. You see this?
- Under the design?

08:51.077 --> 08:54.664
I don't think anything is there
just for aesthetics. Here.

08:55.790 --> 08:59.502
Yeah. Each of the stones
has a different part of the grid embossed.

08:59.669 --> 09:03.340
Signifying where its placing
should be in the final configurations.

09:03.506 --> 09:06.009
- Exactly.
- So what?

09:06.176 --> 09:09.846
"So what?" Do you have a map?

09:13.058 --> 09:15.143
OK, where did you find them?

09:15.310 --> 09:20.648
We found the seven stone here...
the six stone here...

09:20.815 --> 09:24.986
and most recently we stumbled
on the number three stone here.

09:25.153 --> 09:28.948
You have no idea
how lucky a find that was.

09:30.492 --> 09:33.119
- I see it.
- Doctor, I am not sure...

09:33.286 --> 09:37.040
They're buried in a grid.
We needed the number three stone.

09:37.207 --> 09:41.002
That, along with the number seven stone,
gives us two corners.

09:41.169 --> 09:43.505
You can extrapolate how big the grid is

09:43.672 --> 09:46.091
and where the other stones
should be buried.

09:46.257 --> 09:50.637
All right, split up, two teams.
Let's start digging.

09:51.429 --> 09:53.306
Do you think they'll find it?

09:53.473 --> 09:58.019
Many people have come to find
the lost treasure of Quindosim.

09:58.186 --> 10:01.606
- Do you think they will find it?
- I do not know.

10:03.400 --> 10:06.986
We'll wait for them to find the treasure,
then take it by force.

10:07.153 --> 10:10.615
- Your men are not to act until I say.
- Of course.

10:10.782 --> 10:14.577
Which would make us... right, I think.

10:16.997 --> 10:19.624
Can you believe
the progress we've made, Sanir?

10:19.791 --> 10:23.795
How many years
have we been searching for these stones?

10:25.171 --> 10:29.217
- What's wrong?
- We should not be helping them, Allina.

10:29.384 --> 10:32.178
They are helping us
as much as we are helping them.

10:32.345 --> 10:36.558
They will take the Potentia if they find it.
You must see that.

10:36.725 --> 10:40.228
They have come to us
from the great city of Atlantis.

10:40.395 --> 10:45.275
It is for them that the Brotherhood
of the 15 kept the treasure hidden.

10:46.526 --> 10:48.611
I do not trust them, Allina.

10:50.030 --> 10:55.076
If you would rather head back to your
village than help us, I will not stop you.

11:29.152 --> 11:30.820
Check this out.

11:51.049 --> 11:52.676
Allina.

12:08.149 --> 12:12.445
- This is gonna work.
- I think it just might.

12:22.706 --> 12:26.376
It's a layout of the Sudarian villages.

12:27.293 --> 12:30.380
This monastery has protected it
for 10,000 years.

12:30.547 --> 12:32.632
Hm. It's beautiful.

12:33.591 --> 12:38.596
It is... and yet
my eye is drawn elsewhere.

12:38.763 --> 12:42.142
Hm? How so?

12:42.308 --> 12:47.897
I'd like to restore it one day,
but I'm afraid of damaging it.

12:48.064 --> 12:51.067
Perhaps you could help me, Doctor.

12:51.234 --> 12:54.612
Really, you need
to start calling me Rodney.

12:56.239 --> 12:58.324
Very well.

13:03.788 --> 13:06.916
- I don't bore you, do I?
- No. No, no. It's not you.

13:07.083 --> 13:10.462
I just don't think I've ever been so tired.

13:10.628 --> 13:13.590
But you're a scientist.
Are you not used to this?

13:13.757 --> 13:16.384
My kind of science
is the good kind of science,

13:16.551 --> 13:19.846
the kind you can do sitting in a chair
or lying on a couch.

13:21.222 --> 13:26.478
What was it like? Growing up
in the city of the Ancestors, Rodney?

13:26.644 --> 13:29.856
- I'm sorry?
- Atlantis.

13:30.023 --> 13:33.526
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, we didn't, uh...

13:34.694 --> 13:37.864
We come from a planet called Earth,
in a different galaxy.

13:38.031 --> 13:40.325
We only recently made Atlantis our home.

13:40.492 --> 13:43.411
- How recently?
- Just a matter of months, really.

13:45.830 --> 13:47.207
<i>(sighs)</i>

13:47.374 --> 13:50.377
You're tired.
Do not let me keep you from sleep.

13:51.628 --> 13:57.133
If you insist, I'll, um... Yeah. OK.

14:06.643 --> 14:09.479
- I'm heading to bed.
- Which bed might that be?

14:10.647 --> 14:13.400
Hm... What?

14:13.566 --> 14:16.277
I think Allina might have
a crush on you, Doc.

14:17.821 --> 14:21.032
- Oh, she does?
- It is very clear to us all.

14:21.199 --> 14:24.035
- It is?
- Well, everyone but you, apparently.

14:24.202 --> 14:26.621
Should I have, um...?
Are you sure about this?

14:26.788 --> 14:28.873
- I'm very sure.
- What should I do?

14:29.833 --> 14:33.086
- You don't know what to do?
- I know what to do eventually.

14:33.253 --> 14:35.922
What should I do now?
Should I say something?

14:36.881 --> 14:39.634
Tell you what, Valentino,
wait till tomorrow.

14:39.801 --> 14:42.429
You'll be more on your game
after some rest.

14:42.595 --> 14:47.642
Right. Right. Good answer. Goodnight.

15:02.407 --> 15:05.910
It doesn't look much like a map.
I guess I was wrong.

15:06.077 --> 15:10.206
Possibly, although just because
you originally thought it was a map

15:10.373 --> 15:14.419
doesn't make your initial assumption
bad or incorrect.

15:14.586 --> 15:17.797
Well, incorrect, yes,
but it was a good guess.

15:18.882 --> 15:20.550
I'm sorry?

15:21.968 --> 15:28.224
You're... very, very smart,
and, uh... and attractive and whatnot,

15:28.391 --> 15:35.440
and, um... you've got a lot of things
going for you even when things don't...

15:35.607 --> 15:39.944
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's great. Why wouldn't it be?

15:41.029 --> 15:45.617
You sure we're in the right place? We've
doubled the site and not found anything.

15:45.784 --> 15:49.621
It's got to be the right place.
The other stones were where we thought.

15:50.955 --> 15:52.540
Major!

15:54.084 --> 15:59.047
- Tell me you found the stone.
- Not quite, but McKay should look at this.

16:07.305 --> 16:09.474
It carries the mark of the Brotherhood.

16:09.641 --> 16:12.394
The writing's in Ancient. Can you read it?

16:17.941 --> 16:20.443
<i>(McKay) It's a warning.</i>

16:20.610 --> 16:23.780
"Only the Brotherhood of the 15
should enter the chamber..."

16:23.947 --> 16:27.784
- "Of the Quindosim."
- What chamber?

17:09.284 --> 17:11.578
So, who wants to go first?

17:13.913 --> 17:16.458
Seems sort of like a... Sheppard thing?

17:33.266 --> 17:36.019
We couldn't have planned it any better.

17:45.153 --> 17:48.365
<i>(McKay) Oh. Easy, Ford! God!</i>

17:54.454 --> 17:56.331
All right, he's down.

17:56.498 --> 17:58.708
I'll stay here, watch the descender.

17:58.875 --> 18:01.878
I'll let you know
if anything interesting happens.

18:26.319 --> 18:30.699
Do you see this? This is the whole pattern.

18:30.865 --> 18:33.618
The ninth stone
must integrate into this piece.

18:42.919 --> 18:45.839
May I?

18:50.552 --> 18:52.679
I believe we can rule out a map.

18:52.846 --> 18:58.226
- All right. Any ideas?
- I'm getting there.

19:01.980 --> 19:04.065
Take your team to Section Seven.

19:04.232 --> 19:08.820
Dr Weir, I've interfaced our computers
with the Atlantean long-range sensors.

19:08.987 --> 19:13.366
There's an unidentified craft the size
of a Wraith dart heading for the city.

19:13.533 --> 19:15.410
- What?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

19:15.577 --> 19:19.748
The sensors picked it up days ago.
I've only just deciphered what they meant.

19:19.914 --> 19:24.252
- A dart? How is that possible?
- Maybe it was modified to move quickly.

19:24.419 --> 19:26.421
The hive ships are light years away.

19:26.588 --> 19:30.342
It could have used a neighbouring Stargate
and been flying towards us

19:30.508 --> 19:32.761
since the Wraith discovered we were here.

19:32.927 --> 19:36.931
At its current velocity,
it will be here in 27 minutes.

19:40.560 --> 19:43.271
We need to get jumpers in the air.

20:06.753 --> 20:09.005
<i>(Sheppard) What don't you believe?</i>

20:09.172 --> 20:11.716
It's a gate address,
a six-symbol gate address.

20:11.883 --> 20:13.551
Gate symbols?

20:16.096 --> 20:18.181
I see them now. Yes.

20:18.348 --> 20:21.976
- Do you recognise the address?
- No.

20:22.143 --> 20:24.437
I'm not familiar with this one either.

20:24.604 --> 20:27.315
So the ninth stone is on another planet.

20:32.404 --> 20:34.906
- Is he dead?
- No, just unconscious.

20:35.073 --> 20:37.784
- He will be like that for hours.
- Excellent.

20:41.329 --> 20:43.623
We'll wait for them to...

20:52.590 --> 20:55.260
Put the weapon down, Lieutenant Ford.

21:02.767 --> 21:04.436
Ford?

21:10.942 --> 21:12.861
Major Sheppard.

21:13.862 --> 21:16.823
The lieutenant
has had to step away for a moment.

21:18.158 --> 21:20.035
- Who's that?
- It can't be.

21:20.201 --> 21:22.287
- It sounds like...
- Kolya?

21:25.623 --> 21:29.169
- Surprised?
- You're alive.

21:29.336 --> 21:31.171
As far as I can tell.

21:31.338 --> 21:34.966
Did you think a single bullet
to the shoulder would kill me?

21:36.801 --> 21:39.137
I always thought
you were smarter than that.

21:39.304 --> 21:43.600
- What did you do to Ford?
- He's fine.

21:43.767 --> 21:47.562
- Then what do you want?
- The same as you, Major.

21:47.729 --> 21:50.106
The lost treasure of the Quindosim.

21:50.273 --> 21:53.443
What possible use could that be to you?

21:54.361 --> 22:00.075
The Daganians have informed us
that this ZPM is an object of great power,

22:01.159 --> 22:04.537
and great power is of use to all people,
especially the Genii.

22:04.704 --> 22:09.459
- Sanir.
- They offered us a great reward, Allina.

22:09.626 --> 22:12.295
They agreed to let us
keep the treasure if we...

22:15.090 --> 22:19.260
They're no use to you, Kolya.
ZPMs only work on Atlantis.

22:19.427 --> 22:23.890
Perhaps, but I prefer hearing that
from a Genii scientist.

22:24.057 --> 22:27.143
We do not have it yet.
We have not found the ninth stone.

22:27.310 --> 22:30.271
We have a large tactical advantage
over you.

22:31.106 --> 22:35.360
If you want me to cover the mouth
of the chamber and forget the whole thing,

22:35.527 --> 22:37.195
I'm willing to consider it.

22:37.362 --> 22:40.949
<i>(McKay) She's right.
We're closer, but we're not there yet.</i>

22:41.116 --> 22:44.744
The ninth stone is on another planet.
We just have the gate address.

22:44.911 --> 22:49.666
Dr McKay. So wonderful
to hear your grating voice again.

22:51.209 --> 22:53.294
How's the arm?

22:56.923 --> 23:00.593
Do you want to keep trading barbs
or do you want to find the ZPM?

23:03.847 --> 23:07.017
Lift me out, I'll help you find it,
but then you let us go.

23:07.183 --> 23:09.769
- Shut up, McKay.
- You got a better idea?

23:09.936 --> 23:12.022
No.

23:12.188 --> 23:14.566
Do we have a deal or not?

23:16.317 --> 23:18.737
You and two Daganians
will be raised out...

23:20.196 --> 23:22.449
along with
everyone's weapons and radios.

23:22.615 --> 23:24.743
The rest of you will remain here.

23:24.909 --> 23:32.292
If Dr McKay finds the ZPM, the others
will be let go. I give you my word.

23:33.668 --> 23:36.504
Well, we have his word.

23:36.671 --> 23:39.299
I don't see that we have much choice.

23:41.468 --> 23:42.802
I'm coming up.

23:48.308 --> 23:52.604
The population are confined to their
quarters, hopefully out of harm's way.

23:52.771 --> 23:56.608
- Any word from Sheppard yet?
- No. His entire team is off radio.

23:56.775 --> 24:02.864
It's still closing in very fast.
Who is going to fly the third jumper?

24:03.031 --> 24:06.284
I can barely make it
to the mainland without crashing.

24:06.451 --> 24:09.079
I'm a doctor, not a bloody fighter pilot.

24:09.245 --> 24:11.831
A Wraith dart's gonna be here
in ten minutes.

24:11.998 --> 24:14.084
Our only fighter pilot is offworld.

24:14.250 --> 24:17.045
I would like to mount
the best defence we can.

24:17.212 --> 24:19.297
<i>(sighs)</i>

24:20.965 --> 24:23.051
Brilliant.

24:34.396 --> 24:36.981
Jumper Two is away. All three are out.

24:38.525 --> 24:40.610
<i>- Good luck, Carson.
- I'll need it.</i>

24:52.038 --> 24:54.833
- It's not working.
- Try it again.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.336
Look, I've tried it twice,
backwards and forwards.

24:58.503 --> 25:00.922
We've played this game before, McKay.

25:01.089 --> 25:03.174
Try other combinations of the symbols.

25:03.341 --> 25:07.429
- You know how long it would take?
- There are 720 possible gate addresses.

25:07.595 --> 25:11.266
- It's a waste of time.
- The address is the ninth stone's location?

25:11.433 --> 25:14.936
The puzzle is 10,000 years old.
The gate may not exist any more.

25:15.103 --> 25:18.565
Some cultures bury their gates
to render them useless.

25:18.732 --> 25:23.069
What about something else?
What if these aren't Stargate symbols?

25:24.863 --> 25:28.116
Look at them.
What else would they be, huh?

25:29.117 --> 25:32.454
Actually,
these symbols may not be gate-related.

25:32.620 --> 25:34.706
Really? What are you thinking?

25:36.458 --> 25:39.127
Gentlemen,
you should have visual in 30 seconds.

25:42.464 --> 25:44.591
- You ready?
- No, I'm not ready.

25:44.758 --> 25:48.178
- You're gonna do fine.
- Is fine gonna be good enough?

25:48.345 --> 25:51.139
<i>(Zelenka) Coming right at you.</i>

25:51.306 --> 25:53.725
- Do you see it?
- I can't see it anywhere.

26:01.191 --> 26:04.486
Atlantis, Markham and Smith
have been taken out.

26:04.652 --> 26:07.238
<i>(Beckett) It's headed for the city.</i>

26:14.371 --> 26:18.792
This monastery is where the 15 priests
of the Brotherhood used to live.

26:18.958 --> 26:23.963
The mural here is a map, a layout
of Sudaria as it was in their time.

26:24.130 --> 26:30.136
I should have thought of this. The
Sudarians worshipped the Ancestors.

26:30.303 --> 26:35.934
The Stargate was considered a sacred
portal and its symbols religious icons.

26:36.101 --> 26:40.980
- All 36 gate symbols are incorporated.
- So, connect the symbols on the stones...

26:41.147 --> 26:44.359
And you can triangulate
where the centre stone is buried.

26:45.276 --> 26:48.196
- You're a genius.
- Thank you, Rodney.

26:48.363 --> 26:51.616
OK, we're all very impressed,
but let's get on with it.

26:59.290 --> 27:00.959
Shoot it down!

27:04.254 --> 27:07.966
It's right in the middle of the city.
I don't have a clean shot.

27:15.015 --> 27:18.018
- What's it doing?
- It's scanning us.

27:34.200 --> 27:35.577
Huh.

27:35.744 --> 27:38.872
I was hoping it would narrow
the area down a little more.

27:39.039 --> 27:40.832
It was worth a shot.

27:40.999 --> 27:46.671
- How big an area does that represent?
- Several square miles.

27:46.838 --> 27:49.466
Hold on a second. It's part of their symbol.

28:02.979 --> 28:05.815
The mark of the 15. Yes.

28:05.982 --> 28:09.778
- What?
- It's a 15-line symbol. 15 lines.

28:09.944 --> 28:13.448
- Nine lines on the outside.
- Representing the Stone Carriers.

28:13.615 --> 28:18.078
- Six on the inside.
- The Protectors and the Master Handler.

28:19.871 --> 28:23.291
- Do you know where that is?
- Yes, I can take you there.

28:23.458 --> 28:24.918
Hold on a second.

28:29.881 --> 28:32.634
Hold tight.

28:34.260 --> 28:36.805
One more second.

28:40.475 --> 28:42.560
Yes!

28:42.727 --> 28:46.064
We didn't do that.
At least, I don't think we did.

28:46.231 --> 28:48.358
Whatever happened, it's dead.

28:48.525 --> 28:51.778
Atlantis, we have a kill.

28:54.072 --> 28:56.992
Good news, Jumper Two.
Now head on home.

29:03.623 --> 29:06.835
Someone give me a knife.

29:08.628 --> 29:11.631
You all have guns.
Someone give me a knife.

29:13.591 --> 29:15.760
All right.

29:22.517 --> 29:23.977
Rodney.

29:24.144 --> 29:29.024
It's not a map to where the centre stone is.
It is where the centre stone is. Look.

29:51.296 --> 29:53.173
We have all the pieces.

29:53.340 --> 29:58.011
Congratulations, Dr McKay.
You may live yet.

30:09.105 --> 30:13.443
This is pointless. No trapdoors
or hidden passageways.

30:17.614 --> 30:19.741
There may be more than one way in.

30:20.742 --> 30:25.080
If you're trying to hide a chamber,
you don't have lots of entrances and exits.

30:25.246 --> 30:27.540
You'd rather
wait for them to come back?

30:27.707 --> 30:30.335
What have you got that we can use?

30:32.170 --> 30:36.966
I've got a couple of MREs,
some ammo and some med supplies.

30:38.551 --> 30:40.428
<i>(Sheppard) That's a start.</i>

30:40.595 --> 30:43.848
I've got a couple of flash-bangs.
That's about it, though.

30:44.015 --> 30:45.892
Flash-bangs?

30:46.059 --> 30:49.145
Work like grenades.
Pull the pin, depress the trigger.

30:49.312 --> 30:51.773
Once the spoon pops,
you've got 1.5 seconds

30:51.940 --> 30:56.194
before the room's filled with 2.4 million
candlepower and a 175-decibel bang.

30:56.361 --> 31:01.783
It'll stun anyone with their eyes
and ears open for about ten seconds.

31:09.624 --> 31:11.584
You gonna dig us out of here?

31:11.751 --> 31:15.046
Yeah, something like that.
Come over and give me a hand.

31:24.431 --> 31:27.642
<i>(McKay) You want Sora back?
Is that what this is about?</i>

31:27.809 --> 31:30.687
Sora knew what she was doing,
more so than most men.

31:30.854 --> 31:33.857
Besides, the Genii
do not make deals with terrorists.

31:34.024 --> 31:36.109
Terrorists? You attacked us.

31:36.276 --> 31:38.445
After you ambushed us on our own world.

31:38.611 --> 31:41.656
This is crazy.
We're both trying to protect our people.

31:41.823 --> 31:46.995
But if making your people the target
buys my people more time, it's worth it.

31:47.162 --> 31:49.497
- Listen...
- I don't want to discuss it.

31:49.664 --> 31:55.211
Find the ZPM and you can all return
to Atlantis. Fail and the deal's off.

32:05.513 --> 32:09.225
- What happened?
- We had a clean shot, it self-destructed.

32:10.435 --> 32:14.647
- Why?
- No idea. I don't think it came here to fight.

32:14.814 --> 32:19.152
It was only interested in the jumpers
when we were blocking its way to the city.

32:19.319 --> 32:26.076
Darts are not long-range fighters. The
fact it came so far alone... it was a scout.

32:26.242 --> 32:29.496
But why self-destruct?
Scouts should relay information.

32:29.663 --> 32:33.416
But it did relay information. Look.

32:37.087 --> 32:42.384
Just before it exploded,
the dart was transmitting data.

32:45.553 --> 32:48.348
- I don't suppose you could...
- Not any time soon.

32:48.515 --> 32:53.478
- Can we tell where it was sending it?
- I could direct the sensors to the area.

32:53.645 --> 32:56.314
Give me a couple of hours.

33:00.485 --> 33:03.029
I assumed we place the stones
on the pedestal,

33:03.196 --> 33:07.534
put someone's hands on the palm prints
and hopefully we get the ZPM.

33:07.701 --> 33:12.247
- But what order do we put the stones in?
- I think it's pretty straightforward.

33:12.414 --> 33:15.625
Nothing has been yet.
What makes you think this would be?

33:15.792 --> 33:18.920
The last one has grooves
that match the centre position.

33:19.087 --> 33:21.256
- So?
- So it fits snugly into place.

33:21.423 --> 33:24.342
Complete the pattern, get the ZPM.

33:24.509 --> 33:29.472
- Why would they continue to play games?
- You don't understand how they thought.

33:29.639 --> 33:31.516
- Stop stalling.
- We need to...

33:31.683 --> 33:36.938
Pranos, arrange the stones
and retrieve the ZPM, please.

33:51.119 --> 33:54.456
- McKay.
- What do you want me to do?

33:57.709 --> 33:59.377
What's this?

34:12.599 --> 34:15.226
He's dead.

34:17.353 --> 34:20.607
- You knew this would happen.
- Yes. Yes, I did.

34:20.774 --> 34:24.277
I was telling you when you ordered him
to activate the pedestal.

34:24.444 --> 34:26.529
Look, you killed him, not me.

34:38.041 --> 34:41.710
- What's the correct order of the stones?
- I'm not sure yet.

34:49.177 --> 34:52.097
Well, you have four chances to get it right.

34:53.306 --> 34:55.391
You go first.

35:03.775 --> 35:06.277
- Any time you want to start...
- I'm thinking.

35:06.444 --> 35:09.406
- All right. We tried one to nine.
- Thank you, yes.

35:09.572 --> 35:11.950
- How about nine to one?
- Pranos was right.

35:12.117 --> 35:15.370
The centre stone locks into place.
The others move round it.

35:15.537 --> 35:17.998
I need a combination
with five in the middle.

35:18.164 --> 35:21.793
15. It must have something
to do with 15... or nine, or five...

35:21.960 --> 35:24.212
Shut up. Please? I'm trying to think.

35:24.379 --> 35:27.549
- No. My life's at stake.
- Simmer down and let me save it.

35:27.716 --> 35:30.844
- Two heads are better than one.
- That's a misconception.

35:31.011 --> 35:34.472
- Give me the gun. I'll shoot him.
- This is too slow. Choose.

35:34.639 --> 35:37.350
- You got to be somewhere?
- Choose and go.

35:38.935 --> 35:43.231
- I've got nothing.
- Thanks for the pep talk.

35:43.398 --> 35:46.317
Nine to one. It's all I can think of.

35:46.484 --> 35:48.862
- OK. Step back.
- I'm sorry.

35:49.029 --> 35:53.575
- I'm not dead yet.
- Yeah. Sorry.

35:59.080 --> 36:01.583
Major. Now.

36:13.762 --> 36:15.221
- I got it!
- What?

36:15.388 --> 36:17.182
- The Brotherhood of 15.
- And?

36:17.349 --> 36:22.020
Put the numbers one to nine in a grid
so they add up to 15 in every direction.

36:23.355 --> 36:26.900
- You're right. How did you know that?
- It was on a Mensa test.

36:27.067 --> 36:29.402
- You're a member?
- No, but I took the test.

36:29.569 --> 36:33.531
- When?
- You want to talk about this now, Rodney?

36:33.698 --> 36:36.660
Right. Right. OK.

36:36.826 --> 36:39.579
Two, nine, four.

36:39.746 --> 36:43.041
Seven, five, three. Six, one, eight.

36:43.208 --> 36:47.295
- That's it. That's got to be it.
- Good luck.

37:33.633 --> 37:35.635
Aargh!

37:53.486 --> 37:55.864
What the hell just happened?

37:56.031 --> 37:59.200
- Are you OK?
- Yes. Thank you.

37:59.367 --> 38:03.830
- Rodney, I had no way of telling you.
- My eyes! I need my eyes for seeing.

38:03.997 --> 38:09.836
- Get the ZPM, Rodney.
- It's a miracle I can still make out shapes.

38:14.424 --> 38:16.509
Don't look at me.

38:22.974 --> 38:25.852
All right. We're getting out of here.

38:26.019 --> 38:28.229
We'll send a villager to pick you up.

38:28.396 --> 38:31.149
The smart thing would be to kill me now.

38:43.286 --> 38:45.413
You're right.

38:45.580 --> 38:49.501
I tell you what... I'm gonna want
points for this in the future...

38:50.543 --> 38:54.964
but if you ever do this again, I will kill you.

38:58.218 --> 38:59.678
Deal?

39:04.265 --> 39:08.269
- Are we good?
- Yeah, as far as I can see.

39:08.436 --> 39:10.772
Let's move out.

39:12.816 --> 39:15.068
I can't believe
you never mentioned Mensa.

39:15.235 --> 39:17.821
- I took the test. I never joined.
- You passed?

39:17.988 --> 39:20.281
- Yes.
- We have a chapter on Atlantis.

39:20.448 --> 39:22.784
- You could be an honorary...
- Up the rope.

39:24.619 --> 39:27.330
I thought we'd never find
one of those things.

39:27.497 --> 39:29.416
I'm gonna sleep soundly tonight.

39:29.582 --> 39:33.586
I'm gonna be up all night
getting every system I can back online.

39:33.753 --> 39:37.465
Allina, I don't think we'll ever be able
to repay you for this.

39:37.632 --> 39:39.718
You won't have to.

39:48.268 --> 39:50.353
<i>(McKay) I'm sorry?</i>

39:53.440 --> 39:56.735
All right, all right. Easy. Easy.

39:57.902 --> 40:01.865
Allina... you involved the Genii?

40:02.032 --> 40:04.576
This has nothing to do with the Genii.

40:04.743 --> 40:06.953
I'm a member of the New Brotherhood.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.997
Then what is this about?

40:09.164 --> 40:14.502
Ten generations ago, after a severe
culling, the Brotherhood was destroyed.

40:14.669 --> 40:17.714
We found their writings
and decided to complete the task

40:17.881 --> 40:19.966
handed down to us by the Ancestors.

40:20.133 --> 40:22.802
I am the new Master Handler.

40:24.262 --> 40:27.057
We thank you
for helping us find the Potentia,

40:28.016 --> 40:30.101
but it must go into hiding again.

40:30.268 --> 40:34.814
We come from the city of the Ancestors.
That ZPM was intended for us.

40:34.981 --> 40:39.361
No. You live in Atlantis
but you are not the Ancestors.

40:39.527 --> 40:41.613
What did you tell her?

40:43.365 --> 40:47.327
Atlantis might fall
if we don't take this ZPM back.

40:47.494 --> 40:50.497
Do you think
the Ancestors would have wanted that?

40:50.664 --> 40:54.751
<i>- None of us can know their plan.
- (Sheppard) They don't have a plan.</i>

40:54.918 --> 40:59.089
Did they plan to get attacked by
the Wraith and chased out of the galaxy?

40:59.255 --> 41:01.591
Allina, you're far too smart to think...

41:01.758 --> 41:04.761
The Potentia will be put into hiding
on another world.

41:04.928 --> 41:08.431
When the Ancestors return,
our people will be greatly rewarded.

41:08.598 --> 41:13.186
Allina, you can't believe that. Look,
come back with us. Let me prove it to you.

41:13.353 --> 41:16.064
This is how it must be.

41:17.357 --> 41:19.859
Now it is time for you to leave.

41:32.455 --> 41:35.917
- Did you try to explain...?
- I tried. Believe me, we tried.

41:36.084 --> 41:38.461
- We could have used it.
- Of course.

41:38.628 --> 41:43.091
You don't understand. While you were
offworld, a Wraith dart flew over our city.

41:43.258 --> 41:46.886
- I'm sorry?
- We lost a jumper, Markham and Smith.

41:47.053 --> 41:50.306
- We what?
- And it scanned us.

41:50.473 --> 41:54.644
We lost two men and a jumper
and this is the first I hear about it?

41:54.811 --> 41:57.814
You've been out of radio contact
for over 12 hours.

41:57.981 --> 42:02.652
The dart sent a transmission deep
into space and then it self-destructed.

42:02.819 --> 42:05.488
We scanned the area
with our deep space sensors...

42:05.655 --> 42:08.616
- We have deep space sensors?
- It's a long story.

42:08.783 --> 42:11.578
And we found something else...
rather unsettling.

42:11.745 --> 42:15.290
I'm already unsettled. Show me.

42:24.257 --> 42:29.471
- What are those?
- Wraith hive ships. Three of them.

42:29.637 --> 42:33.641
- The system analysis just got back...
- Right. Where are they headed?

42:33.808 --> 42:38.897
If they maintain direction and speed,
they'll be over our planet in two weeks.
