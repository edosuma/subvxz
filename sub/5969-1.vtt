00:15.960 --> 00:18.918
Think about it.
Right on the beach,

00:19.080 --> 00:22.436
ocean breezes, blue skies, seagulls.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.956
- All yours for the taking.
- It's a timeshare.

00:26.120 --> 00:29.112
Well, it's called a timeshare,

00:29.280 --> 00:32.238
but the truth is,
for the two weeks you're at the condo,

00:32.400 --> 00:33.992
you're not sharing anything.

00:34.160 --> 00:37.630
You're not sharing the bathroom,
not sharing the toaster, nothing.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.950
<i>Nada. Zip.</i>

00:40.120 --> 00:44.193
You are the mistress of all you survey.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.072
My nephew looked up the neighbourhood
on the computer.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.274
Your nephew?

00:52.920 --> 00:53.989
Mrs Darby.

00:54.160 --> 00:57.630
He said the condo was
in a bad neighbourhood.

00:57.800 --> 00:58.994
Blacks.

01:03.520 --> 01:07.752
You're right. You're right.

01:07.920 --> 01:11.196
The condo is in a rather
poor majority black neighbourhood.

01:11.360 --> 01:14.511
And you know what?
I'm glad you brought it up.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.477
Seriously.

01:16.640 --> 01:21.270
Otherwise, I might have done something
that I'd be ashamed of later.

01:21.440 --> 01:25.877
And that would be
to sell you that timeshare.

01:26.040 --> 01:29.157
- You would not feel safe there.
- No, I wouldn't.

01:29.320 --> 01:33.791
Of course you wouldn't.
How could you?

01:33.960 --> 01:35.552
We all know,

01:35.720 --> 01:39.998
and I say this at the risk
of sounding a little racist,

01:40.160 --> 01:44.233
black dudes love white women.

01:44.400 --> 01:48.188
Love 'em. I don't know
if it's genetic or if it's society.

01:48.360 --> 01:52.035
We can argue nature versus nurture
all day, but it's a scientific fact

01:52.200 --> 01:55.749
that black men can't get enough
of white women.

01:55.920 --> 01:59.117
Don't think a woman of your age
would be safe from their advances.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.759
No, ma'am.

02:00.920 --> 02:04.196
These big black bucks
don't care whether you're young or old,

02:04.360 --> 02:05.634
skinny or fat,

02:05.800 --> 02:10.078
walking or with two wrinkled stumps
right below the knees.

02:10.240 --> 02:13.949
They want your white flesh.
They want it bad.

02:14.120 --> 02:18.033
Truth be told, I'm part black myself.

02:18.200 --> 02:21.351
And if it wasn't for my wife,
I'd be bending you over the desk

02:21.520 --> 02:23.192
doing you doggy-style right now.

02:24.600 --> 02:29.151
I can just imagine you there,
all alone in that big condo,

02:29.320 --> 02:32.710
awash in a sea of Negro cock.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.711
I'll... I'll take it.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.758
Smart move. Sign your Jane Hancock
on the dotted line.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.718
- You can't go in there.
- Here you go.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.110
- Stan Minton.
- I'll be with you in a second.

02:43.280 --> 02:44.269
Go on. Sign it.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.715
Stan Minton,
you're under arrest for fraud.

02:46.880 --> 02:49.394
Anything you say will be
used against you in a court.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.028
It's just a little mix-up.
Go on, sign it.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.316
- You white Jezebel!
- I'll call Mal!

02:54.480 --> 02:57.950
You're gonna regret this!
Call my attorney!

03:01.240 --> 03:03.800
Madam Foreman,
have you reached a verdict?

03:03.960 --> 03:06.872
- We have, Your Honour.
- Please hand it to the bailiff.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.512
Will the defendant please rise?

03:12.680 --> 03:14.875
Madam Foreman,
how do you find the defendant?

03:15.040 --> 03:18.828
We, the jury,
find the defendant guilty.

03:19.760 --> 03:22.354
- What?
- Thank you, Madam Foreman.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.988
- That bitch!
- Stanley, please, quiet.

03:25.160 --> 03:28.038
Sentencing will be tomorrow at 10am.

03:30.240 --> 03:33.437
- What the fuck just happened in there?
- You lost, Stanley.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.989
I didn't lose.
You're the lawyer, you lost.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.752
I'm truly sorry.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.275
Damn it, man! I'm rich!

03:40.440 --> 03:42.317
I wanted some of that O.J. justice.

03:42.480 --> 03:44.357
Maybe the judge will give probation.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.910
No. In this state, first-degree fraud

03:48.080 --> 03:50.548
carries a minimum
of three to five years.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.472
I got it!

03:52.640 --> 03:55.279
- We bribe the judge.
- I'm not gonna bribe the judge.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.431
- Bribe him.
- I'm not gonna bribe him.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.033
- Bribe him!
- Oh, please.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.792
- Bribe him!
- No!

04:00.960 --> 04:03.520
I don't practise that kind of law,
and I never will.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.875
You wanna bribe the judge?
Be my guest.

04:06.040 --> 04:10.272
I'm sure any shyster on the street
will be happy to do it for you.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.829
Mal? You're fired.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.312
Mr Popper,
is your client ready for sentencing?

04:27.480 --> 04:29.550
He is, Your Honour.

04:29.720 --> 04:33.190
Anything you'd like to say
before the court passes sentence?

04:33.360 --> 04:37.035
Your Honour, my client
has been convicted

04:37.200 --> 04:39.395
of fraud in the first degree.

04:39.560 --> 04:42.836
A crime of which he is innocent.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.276
But even if he were guilty

04:46.440 --> 04:49.079
and his customers were defrauded,

04:49.240 --> 04:53.438
isn't it better that Mr Minton,
as a resident of Los Angeles,

04:53.600 --> 04:56.990
receive the money,
thereby keeping it in the community,

04:57.160 --> 05:00.709
as opposed to some gypsies
or travelling Mexicans,

05:00.880 --> 05:04.839
who would have taken the money
out of the community?

05:06.720 --> 05:09.359
Please take that into consideration.

05:10.640 --> 05:15.953
Mr Minton, you are hereby sentenced to
serve a term of no less than three years

05:16.120 --> 05:18.759
at the Verlaine State
Correctional Facility.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.912
Normally, your sentence
would begin immediately.

05:22.080 --> 05:26.710
However, I'm going to delay
your incarceration for six months

05:26.880 --> 05:31.032
so that you may...
reorganise the charity

05:31.200 --> 05:35.239
that you've established
to teach music to retarded children.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.956
Thank you, judge.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.268
Court is adjourned.

05:43.360 --> 05:47.239
- Teach music to retarded children?
- It sounded good at the time.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.516
- I thought you were gonna bribe him.
- I did.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.274
Hundred grand in Krugerrand
doesn't go too far now.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.112
- Did we win?
- No. I don't get it.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.316
You bribe the judge
and I get three years?

05:56.480 --> 05:58.436
Mandatory.
The judge couldn't fix that.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.068
Now you got six months
to set your affairs in order.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.832
My affairs are already in order.

06:04.120 --> 06:09.194
My legal opinion is that you take
a Brazilian vacation. Permanently.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.555
Sounds like fun.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.233
I can't do that.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.868
Those Krugerrands were the last
liquid asset I had.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.076
The rest of my money
is frozen in the bank.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.708
I'm not gonna run
and leave seven million behind.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.792
Well, Stan,
my old man had a saying:

06:23.960 --> 06:27.509
"You walk through a locker room,
you're gonna see some dick."

06:28.600 --> 06:32.832
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means you rip off enough people,

06:33.000 --> 06:34.911
eventually you're gonna go to jail.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.798
Thanks, that's really comforting.

06:36.960 --> 06:41.238
Hey, I'm a crooked lawyer.
I know I'm going to jail someday.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.631
You don't see me crying about it.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.753
Stan, slow down. You're gonna choke.

06:57.920 --> 07:01.151
I gotta eat now.
I hear that prison food is real crap.

07:01.800 --> 07:05.270
I'm real glad we have six months
together before you have to go to...

07:05.440 --> 07:07.237
- You know.
- Tell me about it.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.597
I could be in jail right now.
Popper's one hell of a lawyer.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.754
I'm gonna be awfully lonely
while you're gone.

07:14.920 --> 07:18.879
I know, sweetheart.
But I think I get conjugal visits.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.918
I can probably stick it to you
once a month or so. Pretty good.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.036
Oh, sure, that's great.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.838
- But I was thinking...
- Mm-hm.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.028
...maybe we could do something now
so I wouldn't be so lonely later.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.918
Like what?

07:33.080 --> 07:37.471
Like maybe we could make a baby.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.959
Mindy, are you crazy?

07:42.120 --> 07:44.190
- I just...
- I'm gonna be gone three years.

07:44.360 --> 07:47.477
Five at the max. What are we gonna do
with the kid when I get out?

07:47.640 --> 07:49.551
Give it up for adoption?
That's cruel.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.632
I thought maybe we could keep it.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.836
Mindy, how many times
have we gone over this?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.275
It's selfish to bring
a child into this world.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.159
A world full of suffering
and hunger and war.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.959
- It's just... selfish!
- I know.

08:03.120 --> 08:05.793
Plus, a kid would totally
cramp our lifestyle.

08:05.960 --> 08:09.839
We couldn't go on vacation when we
wanted, they break stuff, they cry.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.434
You'd get stretch marks.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.160
That's right. Stretch marks.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.389
Scary stuff, huh?

08:16.560 --> 08:19.632
I just let you
walk all over me.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.951
Oh, Mindy, come on.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.315
OK, Mindy, you can get a dog.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.278
After I leave!

08:28.440 --> 08:30.271
Your other steak, sir.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.152
- What do you want, doll?
- Put some Scotch in this.

09:04.320 --> 09:08.598
- We got whiskey.
- Not as good, but it'll have to do.

09:08.760 --> 09:12.469
All right. That'll be 75 cents.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.115
Good deal.

09:16.400 --> 09:20.154
- Keep the change.
- Ooh! Well...

09:22.280 --> 09:23.998
Ah! Give me another one, honey.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.953
Do you got a problem?

09:40.800 --> 09:42.472
No. No, I...

09:42.640 --> 09:46.474
I was just wondering...
you've been to prison, right?

09:46.640 --> 09:48.358
You do have a problem.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.592
No, I... I'm going to prison.

09:51.760 --> 09:54.752
But I've never been there before
and I was just thinking maybe

09:54.920 --> 09:56.512
you could give me some pointers.

09:57.760 --> 10:01.594
- I'll pay you 100 bucks.
- Just for talking?

10:03.720 --> 10:06.712
- How much time did you get?
- Three to five.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.155
- Where at?
- Verlaine.

10:09.320 --> 10:14.155
Verlaine? That's fucked, Stan.
Guards just don't give a damn.

10:14.320 --> 10:17.790
They let the cons beat the shit
out of one another all day.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.439
How am I gonna do in there?

10:19.600 --> 10:22.910
I mean, if you saw me,
would you beat the shit out of me?

10:24.360 --> 10:25.759
I'd probably rape ya.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.709
- You'd rape me?
- Yeah.

10:31.120 --> 10:34.715
So it's true, huh?
A lot of guys turn gay in prison?

10:34.880 --> 10:38.429
I'm always gay.
I only rape people in prison.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.990
- You're gay?
- Yeah. This is a gay bar.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.754
Whoo!

10:44.920 --> 10:46.512
Let's do this thing.

10:49.360 --> 10:50.349
Whoo!

10:50.520 --> 10:54.877
Look, rape isn't an act of sex.
Rape is an act of violence.

10:55.040 --> 10:58.077
And in prison society,
it's all about violence.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.470
You're judged by how bad
other cons fear you.

11:00.640 --> 11:03.598
Raping a dude is the ultimate way
of beating him down.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.751
It means you're one bad motherfucker.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.912
So you rape people?

11:09.080 --> 11:11.992
Well, now that's something
I'm not real proud of.

11:12.160 --> 11:15.835
I don't condone the practise,
to be honest. But I do do it some.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.117
Just to keep up with the Joneses.
You know what I mean.

11:19.280 --> 11:22.955
Little dude like you,
be an easy mark.

11:23.120 --> 11:27.113
Oh, Jesus!
Isn't there anything I could do?

11:27.280 --> 11:29.111
You could join a gang.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.714
- Are you a racist?
- Not really.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.030
That leaves out the Nazis.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.760
- Got any Mob connections?
- No.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.354
- Wouldn't happen to be Latino?
- Uh-uh.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.080
Looks like everybody's gonna rape you.

11:43.320 --> 11:47.074
OK. OK, I... I bet I can be a racist
for three to five years.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.913
- A real racist. Hardcore.
- Well, good.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.310
- Then you can join the Nazis.
- Excellent.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.357
You'll only be raped by other Nazis.

11:54.520 --> 11:58.035
Raped by Nazis? No way!

11:58.200 --> 11:59.394
Anything else I can do?

11:59.560 --> 12:02.438
Isn't there some way I can
cultivate some outlaw image?

12:02.600 --> 12:05.831
- You have to kill a dude.
- Without killing a dude?

12:06.000 --> 12:09.197
In your case,
it'd be a real long shot, Stan.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.272
- Wouldn't happen to have any tats?
- Tats?

12:12.440 --> 12:14.078
Ink.

12:14.240 --> 12:18.074
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
I didn't grow up with my mom. So I...

12:18.240 --> 12:21.038
When I was 18, I got a tattoo.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.514
"Mommy".

12:25.680 --> 12:29.070
You might as well buy a welcome mat,
strap it to your asshole.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.958
Say, "I'm open for business."

12:39.040 --> 12:41.508
Whoo!

12:43.920 --> 12:46.878
- Stan?
- I'm gonna get raped!

12:48.480 --> 12:50.516
Stanny!

12:50.680 --> 12:54.195
Stan, honey.
You wanna wake up?

12:54.360 --> 12:57.238
It's 2.00.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.034
- Good morning, dear.
- Good afternoon, Stan.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.998
I got you some orange juice.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.035
It was all a bad dream.

13:10.200 --> 13:13.317
- Just a horrible dream.
- What was your dream, baby?

13:13.480 --> 13:14.913
It was awful!

13:15.080 --> 13:19.437
I was gonna go to prison
and big men were gonna rape me.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.956
But here I am, safe in my bed.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.712
It was all a bad dream.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.314
But you are gonna be going
to prison, right?

13:28.480 --> 13:31.677
- Huh?
- You're going to prison in six months.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.595
No!

13:37.840 --> 13:39.876
Oh! Oh!

13:40.040 --> 13:43.350
Honey, it's OK.
A lot can happen in six months.

13:43.520 --> 13:47.559
What's gonna happen, Mindy?
Is my anus gonna grow teeth?

13:48.600 --> 13:53.116
No, silly! You'll find a way.
You always do.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.713
What'd you just say?

13:54.880 --> 13:57.269
You always find a way.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.434
That's right. I always do.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.991
My baby ready to eat breakfast?

14:05.840 --> 14:06.989
Mindy...

14:09.000 --> 14:11.639
...did I have a lot growing up?

14:11.800 --> 14:15.713
No, I did not.
I had nothing growing up.

14:15.880 --> 14:19.316
I had a drunk father
who was emotionally unavailable to me.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.710
I had a summer job at Dairy Queen.

14:21.880 --> 14:24.314
I had tomato soup for dinner.

14:24.480 --> 14:26.391
Nobody ever gave me anything.

14:26.560 --> 14:30.553
Truly, mine was
a hardscrabble existence.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.472
Yet look at me today.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.596
I own a palatial estate,

14:34.760 --> 14:36.398
I drive a Lamborghini,

14:36.560 --> 14:38.312
I have a summer house on the lake,

14:38.480 --> 14:41.597
a complete Bang & Olufsen
home theatre system,

14:41.760 --> 14:44.320
a beautiful wife.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.870
And whom do I have to thank
for all this stuff?

14:48.040 --> 14:50.759
Me. Nobody else.

14:50.920 --> 14:54.230
Me. I am a winner.

14:54.400 --> 14:58.154
I set my mind to do something,
and I do it.

14:59.920 --> 15:04.710
And so when I say to you
that I will make myself un-rapeable,

15:04.880 --> 15:08.270
I will be un-rapeable!

15:09.000 --> 15:10.353
Yay!

15:12.280 --> 15:15.192
<i># You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down</i>

15:15.360 --> 15:20.115
<i># You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down</i>

15:20.280 --> 15:22.111
<i>- # You're the best around
- Ow!</i>

15:23.080 --> 15:27.073
<i># Nothing's gonna ever keep you down</i>

15:34.680 --> 15:38.389
I got a couple of things in mind. But
first I got kind of a weird question.

15:38.560 --> 15:41.472
Do you have anything you could tattoo
around my sphincter

15:41.640 --> 15:43.073
to make it less attractive?

15:45.160 --> 15:47.515
Fourteen, 15...

15:47.680 --> 15:51.593
- Stanny, come to bed.
- Not... Not now, Mindy.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.591
Nineteen, 25.

15:53.760 --> 15:57.036
There.
You see new definition?

15:57.200 --> 15:59.270
My forearm. I think I see a new vein.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.078
I see a very sexy man.

16:02.440 --> 16:03.919
You do?

16:04.080 --> 16:06.275
Well, I wonder what he's gonna do next.

16:12.440 --> 16:14.556
Take me, darling.

16:15.320 --> 16:18.869
Mindy, I'm gonna go
to prison in a few months.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.473
Not now, honey.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.998
And while I'm there, men are gonna try
to take advantage of me.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.833
- I don't wanna hear about this.
- This is important.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.956
I'm doing everything I can

16:31.120 --> 16:33.190
to make sure that doesn't happen.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.954
But if it does happen,
and I do get violated...

16:36.120 --> 16:37.235
Stan!

16:38.760 --> 16:41.274
...I want the first time...

16:41.440 --> 16:42.919
...to be by someone I love.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.799
Oh!

16:52.520 --> 16:53.555
Oh.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.351
Stan, I couldn't.

16:58.520 --> 17:01.557
Please, Min, for me.

17:04.720 --> 17:08.156
Well... OK.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.039
Great.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.551
Oh, the horror!

17:27.800 --> 17:29.677
Two!

17:29.840 --> 17:31.751
Three! Four!

17:31.920 --> 17:34.388
Five! Six!

17:34.560 --> 17:37.518
Seven! Eight!

17:37.680 --> 17:40.274
You must concentrate, Stanley.
Concentrate!

17:40.440 --> 17:43.671
- How can I concentrate when I'm bored?
- If you're bored, leave.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.193
Oh, come on, Cho.

17:46.280 --> 17:49.272
- Master Cho!
- Master Cho.

17:49.440 --> 17:52.477
I've been coming here for a week
and I'm still doing baby stuff.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.631
When am I gonna learn to kick some ass?

17:54.800 --> 17:58.156
I'm a yellow belt.
Nobody's afraid of a yellow belt.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.436
You think you're ready
to move up in rank?

18:01.400 --> 18:02.389
Yeah, that's right.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.994
Fine. You'll have your chance.

18:05.160 --> 18:08.789
- Hey, Seymour! Come on.
- All right.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.679
Seymour.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.354
You'll fight Seymour
for honour of green belt.

18:17.080 --> 18:20.152
Want me to fight this little guy?

18:20.320 --> 18:22.675
- All right.
- Fighting stance!

18:22.840 --> 18:25.070
All right, Seymour.
See what you got.

18:27.360 --> 18:28.679
Ah! Ah!

18:28.840 --> 18:30.273
Oof!

18:37.200 --> 18:39.953
- How do you like that, huh, Seymour?
- Stanley!

18:48.080 --> 18:50.514
- Uh!
- You can forget about your refund!

18:55.080 --> 18:56.433
Is that all you got?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.433
Ah!

19:06.600 --> 19:08.113
Pussy.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.790
That's some technique you got.

19:40.480 --> 19:45.474
You couldn't knock a shit
out of a paper bag full of shit.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.149
Oh, and you could do better?

20:03.920 --> 20:05.717
Any questions?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.036
- Mindy!
- Dinner's almost ready!

20:12.200 --> 20:14.191
- I got great news!
- What happened to you?

20:14.360 --> 20:16.874
Never mind that.
I just met the best guy. Guess what?

20:17.040 --> 20:20.191
- He's agreed to be my trainer.
- Really? What's his name?

20:21.200 --> 20:22.269
The Master.

20:25.400 --> 20:28.233
- How do you do?
- The Master.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.838
He's gonna live with us and train me.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.355
I have to pay him
when my accounts get unfrozen.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.112
- Oh.
- Ahem.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.872
And the contract.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.270
Yeah, I'll write it up right now.

20:44.560 --> 20:48.758
I'm so sorry, The Master,
but there's no smoking in the house.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.199
Yes, there is.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.948
I better heat up another Lean Cuisine.

20:59.120 --> 21:02.829
Honey, you've done it again.
You heated it just perfect.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.876
So...

21:06.040 --> 21:08.998
...The Master, where are you from?

21:09.160 --> 21:10.912
Hell.

21:12.320 --> 21:16.552
Oh! What brought you to LA? A job?

21:17.560 --> 21:21.712
I travel where the wind takes me.

21:23.080 --> 21:25.833
Isn't he great?

21:26.000 --> 21:29.037
Well, how long have you been
teaching the art of self-defence?

21:31.640 --> 21:35.474
Young lady,
what I teach is not art.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.517
It is science.

21:37.680 --> 21:42.515
A careful amalgam of the most
deadly parts of karate, kung fu,

21:42.680 --> 21:46.992
Wing Chun, Krav Maga, Muay Thai,

21:47.160 --> 21:50.948
savate and Filipino Kali.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.314
My favourite.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.948
Ooh! Wow!

21:55.680 --> 21:58.319
I find weakness

21:58.480 --> 22:01.040
and turn it into strength.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.078
I find fat and turn it into muscle.

22:04.240 --> 22:08.756
I find blisters
and turn them into canker sores.

22:08.920 --> 22:13.311
I find doubt
and I turn it into will.

22:13.480 --> 22:15.630
You can stop doing that now.

22:15.800 --> 22:18.075
- Doing what?
- Your hand.

22:19.840 --> 22:23.355
Oh. I forgot it was there.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.631
I'm gonna take a shit.

22:31.320 --> 22:33.788
- Enjoy yourself.
- Mm.

22:35.320 --> 22:39.154
Stan, honey,
does he really have to live here?

22:39.320 --> 22:41.515
- The Master?
- He scares me.

22:41.680 --> 22:45.389
I know. He scares me too. That's exactly
why he's the perfect guy to teach me.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.154
- But, Stan...
- Look, want me to survive in prison?

22:48.320 --> 22:51.357
- Of course I do.
- Then don't argue with me about this.

22:51.520 --> 22:52.999
You'll see, he'll grow on you.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.669
Wake up, weakling.

23:05.840 --> 23:09.037
What the hell you doing in here?

23:09.200 --> 23:12.397
It's time to begin your training.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.755
But it's five in the morning.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.718
- Is that liver?
- It's your breakfast.

23:17.880 --> 23:22.908
And every moment you delay,
I squeeze out more of its vital juices.

23:23.080 --> 23:25.310
Trust me, you'll need them later.

23:25.480 --> 23:28.711
- OK, I'm up.
- But are you ready?

23:28.880 --> 23:31.440
Look what I found beside your bed.

23:31.600 --> 23:34.717
This is weakness.

23:34.880 --> 23:38.111
This is defeatism.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.794
Actually, we were kind of enjoying that.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.871
Eat this.

23:43.960 --> 23:46.030
And follow me.

23:52.280 --> 23:53.600
Punch!
All right, now kick.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.750
Punch!
All right, now kick.

23:55.920 --> 23:58.115
Kick!

23:59.120 --> 24:00.439
Kick like you mean it!

24:02.640 --> 24:06.030
- Oh!
- I blended that gross stuff you wanted.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.715
I got it all in Koreatown. I didn't
even know there was a Koreatown.

24:13.240 --> 24:15.117
Too many eggs.

24:15.280 --> 24:18.590
The fish oil is nice.
Ox pancreas is good.

24:19.920 --> 24:22.639
- Next time, use more tongue.
- That's what she said.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.472
- Ooh!
- Oh, Stan!

24:24.640 --> 24:26.437
- I'm all right.
- Get away from him!

24:26.600 --> 24:30.798
- I'm OK.
- Rise and drink your lunch.

24:38.960 --> 24:41.155
Don't I get to eat anything
that tastes good?

24:44.320 --> 24:48.108
- You like hot dogs?
- Yeah, sure.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.510
If you don't drink that,

24:50.680 --> 24:52.955
the boys in prison will feed you...

24:54.240 --> 24:56.435
...many hot dogs.

25:05.520 --> 25:08.557
I can kick your ass so fast
you wouldn't even feel it.

25:08.720 --> 25:12.076
I'd like to see that.

25:12.240 --> 25:15.312
You didn't kick me in the ass.
I didn't feel anything.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.556
Ow! Ow!

25:25.720 --> 25:28.075
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

25:28.240 --> 25:30.037
Ow! Ow! Ow!

25:30.200 --> 25:31.599
Oh! Ow! Ooh!

25:31.760 --> 25:34.149
- Pain is interpretation.
- OK.

25:34.320 --> 25:38.711
I'm gonna call a time-out here. You're
beating my husband with a flaming stick.

25:38.880 --> 25:41.838
Isn't there some kind
of role-playing exercise you can do?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.389
Run along, honey.
This is man stuff here.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.232
Go ahead, Master.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.550
Ow! Ow! Ow!

25:48.720 --> 25:52.110
Ow! Ah! Oh!

25:52.280 --> 25:54.316
Ow! Ah!

25:59.080 --> 26:02.755
No disrespect, I realise this
is strengthening my nipples.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.639
And believe me, I can feel the burn.

26:05.800 --> 26:09.679
I was wondering,
just how important are strong nipples?

26:09.840 --> 26:12.354
- Someday these nipples...
- Ah!

26:12.520 --> 26:15.273
...may save your life.
- Ah!

26:16.560 --> 26:19.916
You are what you eat.

26:20.080 --> 26:23.231
Um, are you sure
that's Eastern mysticism?

26:23.400 --> 26:26.278
Because I learned that
in health class in third grade.

26:26.440 --> 26:27.998
Silence, woman.

26:28.160 --> 26:31.948
I mean, all that stuff about pain
and illusion sounds totally mystical.

26:32.120 --> 26:35.271
But "you are what you eat"?
Even I know that. And I am from Omaha.

26:37.960 --> 26:40.110
What part of Omaha?

26:40.280 --> 26:42.794
- Oh!
- Dundee.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.353
Happy Hollow.

26:46.400 --> 26:47.753
You're Oscar?

26:47.920 --> 26:50.388
I should have known.

26:50.560 --> 26:54.235
Those womanly, childbearing hips

26:54.400 --> 26:59.235
could not be a product
of this perfidious coast.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.551
Uh, do you mind?
I'm trying to eat scorpion here.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.756
Insolent fool!

27:05.240 --> 27:07.993
You have lost the right

27:08.160 --> 27:10.594
to eat scorpion.

27:13.760 --> 27:17.389
Great. There goes my lunch.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.118
- Thanks.
- This is not working.

27:19.280 --> 27:20.952
- Master says...
- Master's a jerk.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.553
- Shh!
- He is!

27:22.720 --> 27:27.111
And he is a creep. The house smells.
Does he have to smoke in every room?

27:27.280 --> 27:30.955
The only time I see you alone is in bed
and you're too tired to...

27:31.120 --> 27:34.351
Hey! I got five months, and then
it's prison. I gotta stay focused.

27:34.520 --> 27:38.798
I gotta think, eat, breathe prison.
I don't have time for anything else.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.838
Not even time for me?

27:44.280 --> 27:45.554
Tell you what.

27:45.720 --> 27:48.951
After I'm done working out
with The Master, I'll rent some movies,

27:49.120 --> 27:52.351
and we'll cuddle around the TV
like old times, OK?

27:52.520 --> 27:54.238
Really?

28:02.120 --> 28:03.189
Mindy!

28:03.360 --> 28:06.079
Some men broke into the house!
They wanna rape you!

28:06.240 --> 28:08.356
- What?
- Big men!

28:08.520 --> 28:11.512
- They wanna rape you! Repeatedly!
- What about The Master?

28:11.680 --> 28:15.036
They have guns! They killed him!
There's nothing we can do!

28:15.200 --> 28:17.998
- You're gonna get raped! Raped!
- Oh, my God!

28:18.160 --> 28:20.720
Raped!

28:20.880 --> 28:22.757
Rape!

28:24.880 --> 28:26.279
There.

28:28.680 --> 28:31.672
- Now you know how I feel.
- What?

28:31.840 --> 28:35.276
Fear of rape. That's what I'm gonna
have to live with for three years.

28:35.440 --> 28:38.876
Nobody broke
into the house?

28:39.040 --> 28:40.189
That's right.

28:40.360 --> 28:43.272
Now maybe you'll be supportive
of what I'm going through.

28:43.440 --> 28:46.910
You son of a bitch!

28:48.440 --> 28:50.635
- OK, you're upset.
- You son of a bitch!

28:50.800 --> 28:53.473
- You don't have to call names. Mindy!
- Son of a bitch!

28:53.640 --> 28:58.031
- Bitch, bitch, bitch! You bastard!
- Mindy. Mindy!

28:58.200 --> 29:01.351
Oh! Mindy.

29:01.520 --> 29:04.080
- What are you doing?
- What's it look like? Leaving.

29:04.240 --> 29:07.357
Why? Because I pull one little prank,
which when you calm down...

29:07.520 --> 29:10.159
It's not just one prank!
You only think about yourself!

29:10.320 --> 29:13.118
You're the most selfish man
who ever lived, ever! Ever!

29:13.280 --> 29:16.556
Whoa! Excuse me? Selfish?
I find that funny! I really do!

29:16.720 --> 29:18.995
I've given you everything
you've ever wanted!

29:19.160 --> 29:20.673
- You're crazy!
- This house!

29:20.840 --> 29:22.717
- It's in your name.
- Those boobs!

29:22.880 --> 29:25.838
- You wanted these.
- You said the Lamborghini's too small,

29:26.000 --> 29:29.754
- I got a second car.
- A 1955 Porsche Speedster!

29:29.920 --> 29:32.798
- It has a back seat!
- Oh!

29:33.760 --> 29:37.639
- What do you want? I'll do anything.
- I want a baby, you asshole!

29:37.800 --> 29:40.598
That again? Fine. OK. You win.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.149
- We'll have a baby.
- Really?

29:43.320 --> 29:46.039
No, not really,
but we can visit people who have kids.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.792
Goodbye!

29:52.440 --> 29:54.829
Good, leave! I don't need you!

29:55.000 --> 29:56.718
I don't need anybody!

29:56.880 --> 29:59.314
<i>God!</i>

29:59.480 --> 30:03.393
Uh, one moment. I'm... meditating.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.035
<i>It's so big! Oh, God!</i>

30:10.200 --> 30:11.758
Mindy left.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.435
<i>- Yes, yes, yes!
- Good.</i>

30:14.600 --> 30:17.478
<i>Oh, God!</i>

30:17.640 --> 30:21.110
Now, the real training can begin.

30:23.440 --> 30:27.319
We do not have time
to teach you the five fingers of death.

30:27.480 --> 30:30.472
We have only time for one finger.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.433
Pick one.

30:33.400 --> 30:36.312
All right. Wait. This one.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.639
Hold this.

30:50.880 --> 30:52.029
Your turn.

31:05.400 --> 31:08.870
Ah! Ow!

31:09.040 --> 31:12.715
Ah! Ah!

31:27.760 --> 31:29.512
Ah!

31:39.840 --> 31:43.469
<i># You don't know what to do, you're
sitting there and you're all alone</i>

31:43.640 --> 31:45.949
Don't look at what you're doing.

31:46.120 --> 31:49.032
Just feel. Feel.

31:49.200 --> 31:52.590
<i># You've got no place to call your home</i>

31:52.760 --> 31:55.957
I felt. It felt bad.

31:58.200 --> 31:59.758
Oh!

32:01.960 --> 32:06.431
You must learn to feel your opponent.
Know his intentions.

32:08.960 --> 32:13.192
If he is good at a distance,
then you must be close.

32:16.880 --> 32:22.159
If he is good close,
then you must fight him at a distance.

32:28.080 --> 32:31.914
What if your opponent is good close
and from a distance?

32:32.080 --> 32:34.036
Then you are up
to your eyeballs in shit.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.634
Watch your mouth.
You are nobody.

32:39.000 --> 32:39.989
Ow!

32:41.240 --> 32:43.800
- Hey, what are those?
- A little something I picked up

32:43.960 --> 32:46.793
- at the Shaolin temple.
- What do you use them for?

32:46.960 --> 32:48.313
Oh!

32:49.040 --> 32:50.439
Oh! Ow!

32:50.600 --> 32:52.318
Oh! Ah!

32:53.080 --> 32:54.957
Your lunch.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.949
Yeah.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.435
- Whoo-hoo!
- All right, that's close enough.

33:58.080 --> 33:59.069
Whoo-hoo!

34:00.240 --> 34:02.151
Hoo-hoo!

34:03.760 --> 34:06.274
Ah!

34:08.400 --> 34:10.516
Never celebrate too early.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.193
I'll remember that.

34:20.199 --> 34:21.349
Yes.

34:24.880 --> 34:27.188
Mississippi five, Mississippi six,

34:27.360 --> 34:29.590
Mississippi seven, Mississippi eight,

34:29.760 --> 34:32.717
Mississippi nine...

34:32.880 --> 34:35.030
My God! That is amazing!

34:35.199 --> 34:37.110
Oh, that's nothing.
You should see him.

34:37.280 --> 34:41.512
It's easy for me. Cigarettes have
ruined my circulation so much

34:41.679 --> 34:44.239
I can't even feel my hands anymore.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.231
So that's your trick.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.879
Mm-hm.

34:48.440 --> 34:52.877
Here's to Stan Minton,
my second finest student.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.270
Second finest?

34:55.440 --> 34:57.078
Who's number one?

34:57.240 --> 35:00.118
I hope you never have to find that out.

35:00.280 --> 35:03.750
He used what I taught him,
not for his own protection,

35:03.920 --> 35:06.070
but for evil.

35:10.720 --> 35:14.429
Well, fuck that guy.
Here's to number two.

35:14.600 --> 35:19.754
Now, drink up.
Stan has one final test.

35:21.040 --> 35:22.359
Tonight.

35:25.120 --> 35:27.998
I do? OK.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.718
Let's go for it.

35:46.360 --> 35:47.998
Hello, Cho.

35:48.160 --> 35:50.799
It's Master Cho to you.

35:50.960 --> 35:54.999
Master Cho? Or Masturbator Cho?

35:55.160 --> 35:59.119
- Excuse me?
- You heard me... punk.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.879
Looking for a beat-down, mister?

36:06.040 --> 36:09.271
What are you looking for?
To beat off?

36:09.440 --> 36:11.112
That's it.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.715
Ooh!

36:43.520 --> 36:45.192
Very good, Stan.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.396
You mind walking me to my car?

36:47.560 --> 36:49.949
All right.

36:50.120 --> 36:54.352
I don't feel too comfortable here.
I don't think the Asian people like me.

37:07.320 --> 37:11.950
All right, you just go up those steps,
turn yourself in for processing.

37:12.120 --> 37:14.395
By the way, slight change of plans.

37:14.560 --> 37:17.313
The Bureau of Prisons
called me yesterday.

37:17.480 --> 37:20.438
They're sending you to Oaksburg,
not Verlaine.

37:20.600 --> 37:24.309
- Why?
- Who knows? Bureaucracy.

37:24.480 --> 37:27.472
It makes no difference.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.633
Go on. You'll do great.

37:31.800 --> 37:34.553
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.276
Uh, did Mindy or her lawyer call
about the divorce?

37:43.920 --> 37:47.071
It's not like I care anyway.
All right.

37:47.240 --> 37:49.071
See you guys in three years.

37:54.560 --> 37:58.758
- What do you think?
- I think you should walk away quickly.

38:06.920 --> 38:09.798
- Ah! Filthy pig!
- I need a beer.

38:09.960 --> 38:11.234
Oh!

38:11.400 --> 38:13.994
Don't get in the car!

38:34.320 --> 38:36.231
This your first time?

38:38.560 --> 38:41.836
Hey, sweetie,
ain't you got a name?

38:42.000 --> 38:44.036
Ah!

38:44.200 --> 38:47.397
Talk to me again,
I'll twist your whole damn titty off.

38:47.560 --> 38:50.677
- Ooh, my mama, ooh, my mama.
- Hey, man, I'm scared too.

38:50.840 --> 38:53.229
But it can't be as bad
as they say it is.

38:53.400 --> 38:57.393
It's just as bad as they say.
The sooner you realise that, the better.

38:57.560 --> 39:01.712
- Tell 'em.
- You'll find out, soon enough.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.755
What'd I say about talking to me?

39:07.160 --> 39:08.434
Damn, man!

39:30.520 --> 39:33.114
Welcome to Oaksburg Penitentiary.

39:33.280 --> 39:36.238
For reasons beyond
what I care to imagine,

39:36.400 --> 39:39.995
you gentlemen have found yourselves
under my stewardship.

39:40.160 --> 39:44.199
My name is Warden Francis Gasque.

39:44.360 --> 39:46.669
But you can just call me Boss.

39:46.840 --> 39:50.435
We only got one rule here at Oaksburg:

39:50.600 --> 39:55.958
Don't fuck with the Boss. That means
you leave me and my men alone.

39:56.120 --> 40:00.636
What you animals do to each other,
that's your business.

40:00.800 --> 40:04.395
And right behind you
is the warden's garden.

40:04.560 --> 40:09.509
Anybody caught pissing on that
will have his penis removed.

40:11.080 --> 40:14.629
Sergeant Bullard will lead you
to the medical office where you'll strip

40:14.800 --> 40:18.713
and have your cavities searched.
You're gonna enjoy that.

40:18.880 --> 40:22.998
Now, gentlemen! Single file.
Come on! Get up there.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.149
Pecker to butthole.

40:28.480 --> 40:31.631
All right, assume the position.

40:37.120 --> 40:40.715
Why you screaming like a little girl?!

40:40.880 --> 40:43.792
Sarge, look.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.678
Sweet Jesus!

40:48.160 --> 40:52.358
It's like an alien
staring into my soul.

40:54.360 --> 40:58.592
Welcome home. New luxury condos,
compliments of the state.

40:58.760 --> 41:00.398
Step it up, boys.

41:06.160 --> 41:09.038
Come on, sweet meat!

41:16.960 --> 41:21.397
Hello there, young fella.
I guess we're cellmates.

41:22.800 --> 41:26.679
My name's Larry.
But you can call me Shorts.

41:26.840 --> 41:29.274
Shorts, you're in my bunk.

41:29.440 --> 41:33.194
- What?
- That's my bunk. Get out.

41:33.360 --> 41:36.557
You hold on there
just a second.

41:36.720 --> 41:39.951
This is my bunk.
What gives you the right to?

41:40.120 --> 41:41.633
Ow!

41:43.200 --> 41:48.320
- I said that's my bunk.
- Yeah, I guess it is.

41:48.480 --> 41:49.629
Whoo!

41:55.760 --> 41:58.991
Uh, you might wanna change the sheets.

42:00.840 --> 42:03.638
I'm kind of a compulsive masturbator.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.879
Shorts, that's your bunk.

42:10.040 --> 42:13.112
- Really?
- Absolutely.

42:13.280 --> 42:17.034
Thanks, buddy.
I think we're gonna get along just fine.

42:17.200 --> 42:18.428
Hey, put her here.

42:20.680 --> 42:24.116
- I don't shake hands.
- Well, whatever.

42:28.040 --> 42:30.349
Ah, good to be back.

42:32.400 --> 42:35.039
Tell me, Shorts,
who's the toughest guy here?

42:35.200 --> 42:37.350
Who's the biggest bad-ass
in the cell block?

42:37.520 --> 42:40.637
Biggest bad-ass?
There's a lot of contenders.

42:40.800 --> 42:44.588
There's Cleon. He's leader
of the Diamond Kings, the black gang.

42:44.760 --> 42:49.356
- I seen him kill a man with his fist.
- That's right! Yeah!

42:49.520 --> 42:53.718
Then there's Juanito.
He's head of the Mexican gang.

42:53.880 --> 42:55.791
Hey, get back. Hey!

42:55.960 --> 42:59.475
And whatever you do,
don't go near those guys.

42:59.640 --> 43:04.589
- The goal is to express ourselves...
- They're Scientologists.

43:04.760 --> 43:08.150
- They don't look so tough.
- Yeah. They'll talk your ear off

43:08.320 --> 43:10.709
- and then sue your ass.
...distinguish fear.

43:10.880 --> 43:14.668
Then there's the Nazis.
None of them are too tough.

43:14.840 --> 43:18.753
They don't fight fair and don't fight
alone. They always gang up on you.

43:18.920 --> 43:21.718
Their leader, Patterson,
he's a real bastard.

43:21.880 --> 43:25.190
His uncle's the head
of the Aryan Nation.

43:25.360 --> 43:27.112
Let me clarify my question, Shorts.

43:27.280 --> 43:29.840
Who's the most
dangerous sexual predator?

43:30.000 --> 43:31.877
Oh, that's easy.

43:32.040 --> 43:35.077
It's Big Raymond.
Absolutely insatiable.

43:35.240 --> 43:38.118
Crazy. The other black guys
don't go near him.

43:38.280 --> 43:41.795
But they'd back him up
if it came to a fight.

43:41.960 --> 43:44.110
Big Raymond it is.

43:44.280 --> 43:46.077
- Can I borrow that?
- Yeah.

43:46.240 --> 43:47.673
Thanks.

43:49.320 --> 43:51.914
Hey, Stan. Stan, where you going?

43:52.080 --> 43:54.833
You think that cigarette was free?
Is that what you think?

43:55.000 --> 43:57.560
I'll pay you back, man.
I don't have any money.

43:57.720 --> 44:00.075
You think I want money?

44:01.240 --> 44:02.355
Mmm...

44:02.520 --> 44:05.956
- Excuse me.
- Bug off, bitch!

44:06.120 --> 44:08.429
I'll get to you later.

44:08.600 --> 44:10.397
Did you just call me bitch?

44:11.800 --> 44:13.677
Yeah, I said it.

44:17.360 --> 44:19.396
Hey, everybody! Did you hear that?

44:19.560 --> 44:22.632
Big Raymond, for no reason,
just called me bitch!

44:22.800 --> 44:24.438
Now, was that nice?

44:24.600 --> 44:27.239
It's not like I called him fat.

44:28.480 --> 44:31.472
It's not like I said I seen pig shit
prettier than he is.

44:33.960 --> 44:37.509
It's not like I said his mother's pussy
smells like egg salad.

44:38.560 --> 44:40.118
Which it does.

44:48.200 --> 44:51.192
Oh, hell nah! Ohhh, hell nah!

44:51.360 --> 44:54.432
Hell nah! Oh, hell nah!

44:54.600 --> 44:56.397
Ho-ho! Yeah!

45:09.720 --> 45:12.996
Ah! Ah!

45:13.160 --> 45:15.674
Ahhh!

45:17.800 --> 45:19.358
Who's the bitch now, bitch?

45:21.160 --> 45:22.434
Ooh!

45:22.600 --> 45:25.398
I told you Raymond was gonna get
his ass beat. I told you!

45:28.840 --> 45:31.513
My cracker!

45:31.680 --> 45:34.035
Laying the boot to the big nigga.
Give it up!

45:34.200 --> 45:36.953
Don't use that word around me.
It's ugly and racist.

45:38.400 --> 45:41.995
Yeah, dawg!

45:43.360 --> 45:45.157
He's funny too, man.

45:45.320 --> 45:48.039
All right, listen here, player.
All right?

45:48.200 --> 45:51.670
We want you to join up with us,
nah mean? Them niggas is gonna tear...

45:51.840 --> 45:53.876
Ooh!

45:54.040 --> 45:55.837
I said don't talk that way around me.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.319
Let me get some of that!

45:57.480 --> 46:00.438
- Let's kill him.
- No, I got it, I got it. I got it!

46:01.240 --> 46:03.037
Handle your business, Cleon.

46:06.480 --> 46:10.029
Oh, come on. Don't tell me you're gonna
stick up for that fat son of a bitch.

46:10.200 --> 46:13.397
You happen to see the colour
of that fat son of a bitch's skin?

46:13.560 --> 46:15.676
Hey, aren't we over that?

46:15.840 --> 46:18.513
<i>Didn't you see that Nova episode?
Huh, you guys?</i>

46:18.680 --> 46:20.636
They did that DNA test.

46:20.800 --> 46:23.155
- We all come from Africa.
- Kick his ass.

46:23.320 --> 46:27.393
It's a proven fact. Under the skin,
I'm just as black as you are.

46:27.560 --> 46:28.959
- Fuck that.
- Get him!

46:29.120 --> 46:32.669
- Get him, man! Get him! Get him!
- Motherfucker!

46:38.840 --> 46:40.717
- Get him!
- Ah!

46:51.480 --> 46:53.118
Man, get that fool!

47:05.440 --> 47:06.634
Dumb bitch!

47:10.760 --> 47:12.478
Hold on. See what happens.

47:19.040 --> 47:21.076
- Oh!
- Ah!

47:37.480 --> 47:39.596
Oh!

47:46.000 --> 47:48.673
- Take the stick!
- No, don't take it!

47:55.200 --> 47:57.998
- Take the stick!
- No, don't take it!

47:59.680 --> 48:01.477
Oh, he did it again.

48:06.800 --> 48:08.916
- Take the stick! Take it!
- Mm-hm?

48:09.080 --> 48:11.640
No, no, don't take it!

48:16.080 --> 48:17.672
Whoo!

48:20.000 --> 48:22.195
I told him
not to take that stick.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.717
Even the Asian!

48:32.280 --> 48:34.191
Where the hell did that guy come from?

48:34.360 --> 48:36.157
- Whoo!
- Damn!

48:36.320 --> 48:38.436
- That guy's good.
- All right.

48:38.600 --> 48:40.397
Come on, Cleon.

48:40.560 --> 48:43.120
It's your time, baby.
Don't be scared.

48:43.280 --> 48:45.396
It's your time to shine, Cleon.

48:46.320 --> 48:47.548
Ooh!

48:50.400 --> 48:52.356
Cleon.

48:52.520 --> 48:56.479
If you wanna fight me,
you're gonna have to fight me.

48:56.640 --> 48:59.632
- I understand.
- Pick up your gold teeth.

48:59.800 --> 49:03.156
I'm gonna let you keep them this time.

49:03.320 --> 49:05.276
But if you come at me again...

49:05.880 --> 49:08.189
...l'm gonna hang onto them
like a Swiss banker.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.355
Ya'll ain't gonna help me?

49:25.520 --> 49:28.080
I'm missing a bicuspid.

49:29.480 --> 49:31.789
We should have killed him.

49:31.960 --> 49:35.748
Somebody,
call an orthodontist.

49:40.200 --> 49:43.590
Hm. I see Mr Minton
has acquainted himself

49:43.760 --> 49:45.876
with his new surroundings.

49:46.880 --> 49:49.713
I believe it's time I had
my little chat with him.

49:54.600 --> 49:55.999
Ow!

49:58.040 --> 50:01.510
Whoa, whoa, look out.

50:01.680 --> 50:03.636
Beat it. All of you.

50:13.520 --> 50:17.638
Oh, man, this stuff's good. I don't know
what everybody's complaining about.

50:17.800 --> 50:19.518
You're kidding me.

50:19.680 --> 50:22.638
Hey, man.
I just wanna say thanks.

50:23.880 --> 50:24.869
For what?

50:26.640 --> 50:29.359
You know, for helping me before.

50:29.520 --> 50:30.669
With Big Raymond.

50:30.840 --> 50:33.593
I wasn't helping you.
I was helping me.

50:34.440 --> 50:38.274
I had to beat up the biggest shithead.
He happened to be talking to you.

50:39.160 --> 50:40.639
OK.

50:41.720 --> 50:44.757
But, you know, I... I mean, I...

50:44.920 --> 50:46.831
I think that guy wanted to fuck me.

50:50.520 --> 50:54.354
Trust me, in your case,
I was just putting off the inevitable.

51:00.040 --> 51:03.191
Yeah.

51:03.360 --> 51:04.713
Well, thanks anyway.

51:06.480 --> 51:09.790
What's your name, girl?
Don't be shy, just say hi.

51:10.640 --> 51:12.949
Come here. Kick back, baby girl!

51:13.120 --> 51:15.998
Little hard on the kid, weren't you?

51:16.160 --> 51:19.311
That's got nothing to do with me.
And I'm gonna keep it that way.

51:19.480 --> 51:21.630
- You got that?
- Mm-hm.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.116
One-one-five!

51:41.840 --> 51:45.116
Minton, warden wants to see you.
Get up.

51:45.280 --> 51:47.555
- Me?
- Now! Walk!

51:48.720 --> 51:50.358
Put your hands behind your back.

51:53.720 --> 51:56.757
Come in.

52:01.120 --> 52:03.395
Minton, I'm glad you could make it.

52:03.560 --> 52:06.791
- You can take the cuffs off him.
- Sure you wanna do that, Boss?

52:06.960 --> 52:08.951
I said take 'em off.

52:09.120 --> 52:11.588
It's all right.

52:11.760 --> 52:12.988
I already got 'em.

52:14.960 --> 52:16.916
It's a matter of dislocating the wrists.

52:21.640 --> 52:25.349
Ew! Ew, that is creepy!

52:25.520 --> 52:28.637
You can wait outside.

52:29.640 --> 52:30.709
Have a seat.

52:36.280 --> 52:38.999
Warden, if this is about me
fighting in the yard, it...

52:39.160 --> 52:40.593
Cigar?

52:42.320 --> 52:43.719
Thank you.

52:47.320 --> 52:48.469
Brandy?

52:50.120 --> 52:52.236
Sure.

53:01.720 --> 53:03.676
You know, you wardens should complain.

53:03.840 --> 53:07.879
'Cause in the movies,
they always make you look like assholes.

53:08.040 --> 53:12.909
Well,
I don't plan on being a warden forever.

53:13.080 --> 53:15.594
- Is that right?
- Tell me, Minton.

53:15.760 --> 53:18.035
What do you think of this place?

53:19.440 --> 53:21.749
It's OK, for a prison.

53:21.920 --> 53:25.959
Not the prison. The land.

53:29.320 --> 53:33.996
It's a nice sized property. Great views
of the foothills and city. Level grade.

53:34.160 --> 53:37.357
I'm assuming there's
bedrock beneath us.

53:37.520 --> 53:42.071
Easy access to downtown.
I see some nice development potential.

53:42.240 --> 53:45.277
- Too bad you got a prison on it.
- Exactly.

53:45.440 --> 53:49.592
You know, it's no accident
you came to Oaksburg.

53:49.760 --> 53:52.513
I pulled a few strings
to get you here.

53:55.480 --> 53:57.072
What made you wanna do that?

53:59.360 --> 54:00.759
Come here.

54:04.480 --> 54:07.472
Oaksburg Estates.

54:07.640 --> 54:11.872
I'm a silent partner, so to speak,
with some private investors

54:12.040 --> 54:17.114
who would like to develop this land
into timeshare condominiums.

54:17.280 --> 54:20.989
I believe that's
your field of expertise.

54:21.160 --> 54:24.436
- True.
- 'Course, all this is only possible

54:24.600 --> 54:27.273
in the event the prison
ever closes down.

54:27.440 --> 54:30.955
- Makes sense.
- You know, I'm in the prison business.

54:31.120 --> 54:33.680
I know how to break a man's will,
crush his spirit.

54:33.840 --> 54:37.879
But them real estate contracts,
those things put a real hurt on you.

54:38.040 --> 54:39.519
That's where you come in.

54:44.080 --> 54:46.913
- What's in it for me?
- How would you like to be out of here

54:47.080 --> 54:48.069
in a year?

54:50.200 --> 54:54.352
- But I've got a mandatory minimum.
- Wardens have great discretion

54:54.520 --> 54:59.150
getting early parole, especially
to non-violent, first-time offenders.

54:59.320 --> 55:03.791
- Prisons are crowded, you know.
- The system is corrupt.

55:03.960 --> 55:05.154
Me likey.

55:05.320 --> 55:08.756
But you gotta move the luxury units
closer to the lagoon.

55:08.920 --> 55:11.480
That'll double rents.
Parking goes underground.

55:11.640 --> 55:14.916
Wasting space. Eight extra units.
Whoever designed this is a moron.

55:15.080 --> 55:17.958
- How will you get rid of the prison?
- Let me worry about that.

55:18.120 --> 55:20.350
Tell me more about them parking spaces.

55:44.880 --> 55:47.155
You strapped?

55:47.320 --> 55:49.595
He ain't gonna know what hit him,
nah mean?

56:01.520 --> 56:02.509
Ah!

56:05.280 --> 56:07.510
That's gonna scar, you psycho.

56:12.400 --> 56:14.356
Whoo!

56:24.680 --> 56:26.557
You want that shiv, don't you?

56:28.160 --> 56:30.913
You made that with a melted toothbrush
and a razorblade?

56:31.080 --> 56:32.752
- That's very creative.
- Ah!

56:38.680 --> 56:41.797
Look what I made
with three bars of soap and a shoelace.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.831
Cracker, please.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.310
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

57:01.840 --> 57:03.751
Come on, race traitor.

57:06.320 --> 57:08.390
- Ah!
- Ooh!

57:14.720 --> 57:16.278
Oh!

57:16.960 --> 57:19.554
Ha!

57:19.720 --> 57:21.790
Hee-yah!

57:23.680 --> 57:25.238
He's all yours.

57:27.120 --> 57:28.678
This gonna be fun.

57:38.080 --> 57:41.789
Hey, Stan. What'd you do to Patterson?

57:41.960 --> 57:44.235
I just roughed him up a little bit.

57:44.400 --> 57:47.995
- Why?
- Somebody took a shiv to his ass.

57:48.160 --> 57:52.676
They say he'll be shitting sideways
for a month.

57:52.840 --> 57:55.559
Now I know
what schadenfreude feels like.

57:55.720 --> 57:57.517
- What?
- Schadenfreude.

57:57.680 --> 58:01.275
It's German for when you feel good
because your enemy's anus is violated.

58:01.440 --> 58:03.317
Oh.

58:07.240 --> 58:08.958
You know you're getting that on me.

58:12.800 --> 58:15.598
<i>I'm doing great.
You guys are pussies.</i>

58:15.760 --> 58:20.038
That's terrific. Hey, listen, pal.
I need your help.

58:20.200 --> 58:23.317
I can't get Mindy's lawyer
to return my call.

58:23.480 --> 58:25.789
If we wanna go through
with this divorce,

58:25.960 --> 58:29.191
you're going to have
to contact her personally.

58:30.080 --> 58:31.308
<i>Stan.</i>

58:31.480 --> 58:33.072
Yeah. I'll get right on that.

58:33.240 --> 58:36.516
<i>How's the appeal coming?</i>

58:36.680 --> 58:41.435
Believe it or not, I'm looking
at the Madam Foreman right now.

58:41.600 --> 58:43.318
<i>That's great.</i>

58:43.480 --> 58:48.679
I gotta go now.
You know, duty calls.

58:48.840 --> 58:51.035
All right. Thanks, Lew.
I'll talk to you soon.

58:59.520 --> 59:02.751
Ain't you Charlize Theron?

59:04.200 --> 59:07.158
Oh, look what fell out there.

59:13.160 --> 59:16.550
So I had them
exchange the beef for horse meat.

59:16.720 --> 59:19.632
- Clever.
- That's Stan.

59:19.800 --> 59:22.109
Minton, I'd like for you
to meet Mr Dang.

59:22.280 --> 59:24.236
He's on the prison's board of governors.

59:24.400 --> 59:28.279
They let Vietnamese mafia on
the prison board of governors?

59:30.000 --> 59:31.115
Your finger tats.

59:32.440 --> 59:37.833
Like you say, Stan,
the system is corrupt.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.993
Mr Dang's family happens to be
my partners in Oaksburg Estates.

59:42.160 --> 59:44.799
Oh, good, 'cause I was just
going over the contracts.

59:44.960 --> 59:47.952
The language gets rather vague
on gross versus net liability.

59:48.120 --> 59:51.476
I'm sure it's unintentional, but that
could screw you in the long run.

59:51.640 --> 59:56.430
Could it? I'll have my lawyers
correct that immediately.

59:56.600 --> 59:59.910
I got an excellent lawyer for that.
He specialises in it. Lew Popper.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.390
Popper? I'll be sure to contact him.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.269
Come on, Dang,
let's check out the floor show.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:16.190
It looks like the savages
are ready for the inspection.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:20.876
Well, give me a few more weeks.
I'll even have 'em readier.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.917
I'm counting on that.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.436
Would you like a strawberry?

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.792
- I grew them in my own garden.
- Thank you.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.349
Minton? Strawberry?

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.469
No, I'm good.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.112
Maybe I picked 'em
a little too soon.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.877
I don't think that's it.

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.708
<i>People
are scared shitless of me.</i>

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.154
Very good, Stan.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.515
<i>Is there anyone there
who can challenge you?</i>

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.274
Nah. I got it all under control.

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:00.510
What's the matter, Stan?

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:03.752
You sound... distant.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.558
<i>I don't know. It's just...</i>

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:09.269
Don't you ever find yourself
feeling sorry for anybody?

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.955
You might as well ask me
if I feel sorry for the maggots

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.917
I grind into my morning coffee.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.470
That's how I feel too.
Listen, I gotta go.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.393
Make me proud, Stan.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.120
Come on, baby!
Do it to me!

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.510
- Oh, yeah!
- Are you using me?

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.796
- No!
- Don't you love me?

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.951
- Yeah!
- Show me!

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.792
- Do you love me?
- Yeah. Hello. Hey!

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.758
Excuse me. Excuse me. Yeah.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.639
Hi, Stan. Yeah.
I think I have good news.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.588
- Do you love me?
- Yeah. I think the... I think the...

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:55.959
The Madam Foreman is just one orgasm
away from giving you your appeal.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.793
<i>That's great, Lew.
And gross.</i>

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.916
Heard from Mindy or her attorney?

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.071
Uh, no.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.915
But don't say I don't earn my money.

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:15.915
Hi, fellas.
I don't believe I ordered Chinese.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.790
I guess I could go
for a little pot-sticker.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.198
Who are you writing to?

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:31.590
No one special.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:36.037
You've been sitting there for a while
writing to no one special.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.995
You know, Stan, I've been here for a
long time. I can handle a lot of things.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.709
Like having to spend the rest
of my life in this shithole.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.997
But there's one thing I do regret.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.516
I could never make it work
with Miyoshi.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:59.437
Oh, she was the only person
who ever loved me for me.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:04.278
I was too pigheaded to realise it.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:09.560
I'd give anything
to change the way I behaved.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.078
How did you behave?

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.275
I killed her.

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.154
Oh.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.950
Alcohol wasn't something that always
brought out the best in me, Stan.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.193
<i>Dear Mindy, I've been
thinking a lot about you lately.</i>

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.078
<i>About us.</i>

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.310
<i>I realise now that you were right.</i>

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.711
<i>I was pigheaded and selfish.</i>

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.316
<i>Leaving me was probably
the best thing for you.</i>

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.391
<i>And I'm truly sorry.</i>

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.154
<i>I never should have hurt you.</i>

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.232
<i>I know now why you wanted
to have a baby with me.</i>

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.595
<i>It's just another way
for us to love each other</i>

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.399
<i>even more deeply.</i>

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:12.950
<i>I hope, someday,
you'll be able to forgive me.</i>

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.918
<i>Love always, Stan.</i>

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:22.758
Hey, baby.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:34.954
Now, I know all of you want to get back
to your weightlifting and basketball

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:38.430
and masturbating, so I'm gonna
try to keep this short. All right?

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:43.879
I am throwing away all of these
violent video games and movies.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.115
Don't do that! No! Come on, man!

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:51.670
From now on, I want you guys
watching more wholesome entertainment.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.196
And frankly, a lot of the rap music
you brothers listen to

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.715
was too hateful towards women.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.838
What is up with that?
You like women, right?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.149
Yeah!

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.992
Now, on the other hand,

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.232
the Mexicans are onto something
with mariachi and salsa music.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.197
It's positive, easy to dance to
and you never get tired of it.

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:17.113
- Shorts, give us a taste.
- Here we go.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.838
Holy shit.

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.798
All right. All right, all right.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:01.350
That's Afro-Cuban. I asked
for mariachi. But you get the point.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:04.592
All right? Now, lastly,
and most importantly,

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.558
from now on, there will
be no more rape at this prison.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.154
No, no!

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.551
That's right.
Anyone who rapes another inmate

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.473
- will have to answer to me.
- Boo!

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.278
I will not be kind.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:21.193
- Excuse me, Big Stan.
- Yes, Juanito.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.715
Why you putting your nose
where it don't belong?

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.030
My men are aggressive and hard.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:29.909
Sometimes they need a way to work off
that excess energy. What's it to you?

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:32.958
- OK. Well, first off, good question.
- Thank you.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:37.159
What is it to me?
Well, frankly, I just don't like it.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:41.029
And let me show you why.
Robbie, come up here.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.997
You, Robbie the hippie.
Come up here.

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.434
All right, all right. Robbie, how long
is your sentence here at Oaksburg?

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:55.354
- Five to ten.
- Five to ten years.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:58.273
What exactly did you do
to earn that sentence?

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:01.796
I sold marijuana.

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:05.475
A shitload of marijuana.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.670
Thanks, Robbie. Go sit down.

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.230
He sold marijuana.
He was a marijuana dealer.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:17.154
I'm not here to argue about drug policy.
I don't think they're tough enough.

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:20.869
Whatever.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:24.271
But just because Robbie was guilty
of selling dope

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:29.230
doesn't mean he deserves to get raped
up the ass every day for ten years.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.550
I just don't think that's fair.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.632
Some of you are here

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:40.511
because you're habitual drunk drivers.
Some of you have a fondness for crack.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.717
Some of you robbed a bank.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.395
I'm talking to you, Lee Otis.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:53.315
But that doesn't mean you should
get raped. It's just not fair.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:58.276
- Yes, Carnahan.
- What about guys convicted of rape?

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.637
- Can we rape them?
- Yeah!

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.791
Rape the rapists.
Seems appropriate.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:06.394
Punishment fitting the crime and all.
Go ahead.

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.313
That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:13.871
- How about them child molesters?
- Yeah!

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.314
Yeah, them too. Good point.
Anyone else?

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:22.589
Big Stan!

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:26.912
- What about the counterfeiters?
- What?

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:31.232
Counterfeiters? Big Raymond,
you're the only counterfeiter here.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:34.118
Yeah!

01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:37.317
Wait a minute.
Do you just want somebody to?

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:39.755
Aw!

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.990
OK, here's another thing
we gotta clear up.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.152
There's a difference
between homosexual sex and rape.

01:08:45.319 --> 01:08:48.756
- Now, Big Raymond.
- Hm?

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.639
There's someone here
who wants to have sex with you.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.189
- Not me!
- OK? How about it, anyone?

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.078
Yeah. Yeah.

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:05.151
Tyler!

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:09.676
- Great!
- Man!

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.792
You two have fun.
But wear protection.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.871
OK.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:28.555
All right, grow up. Look, if you've got
a problem with that, then that's...

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:33.719
Nurse!

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:43.469
Now, those two are about to have
consensual homosexual sex.

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:46.518
A beautiful, beautiful thing.
The total opposite of rape,

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.752
- which is not allowed.
- Except for rapists and molesters?

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.036
- We can still rape them.
- No, you can't.

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:55.476
- What?
- I changed my mind.

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.153
Bad habit. Quit cold turkey.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:00.596
If you're not happy with it,

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:04.355
you're welcome to fight me.

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.708
I didn't think so.
All right, you're dismissed.

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.996
Beat it.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.749
- Good speech.
- You think?

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.718
- I should have opened with a joke.
- No, it was good.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.031
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Sorry about the mariachi.

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.349
Let it go.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:27.512
Hey, Big Stan.
Check out the lovebirds.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.798
One for you!

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.758
Mm! One for you.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.029
Good for them.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.750
I have something important to show you.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.035
Let me eat, will you?

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.394
Hey, Big Stan.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:49.636
- Can we talk?
- Make it quick.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.916
I wanna thank you
for what you did out there.

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:55.311
- I didn't do anything...
- Don't say you didn't do it for me.

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:58.517
Because you did, didn't you?

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:02.872
- A little.
- Well, thanks.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.316
- Yeah. Thanks, man.
- Julio!

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.074
Get back here!
What's up with you?

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.309
Shut up!

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:16.318
Hey, Big Stan.
I like what you said.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.833
I wanna join your gang.

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:23.309
- I don't have a gang.
- Yes, you do.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:28.709
OK, you're in.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:34.510
Me too?

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.632
Yeah, you too.

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.993
- All of you.
- Thanks.

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.397
Yeah! Ow!

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.869
All right, can I eat now?

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:01.432
- Yes, you did!
- He's gotta eat.

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.640
I told you I had something important
to show you.

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:14.789
From Mindy.

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:24.993
She wants to see me.

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.952
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.153
Shake hands.

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:54.511
Try to get along, huh?

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:03.839
Thanks.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:18.672
- Excuse me, man.
- No, that was my bad.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:21.354
No, really. It was my fault.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.557
There's a pickup game of hoops later,
if you wanna play.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.755
I'd like that.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.515
- Happy birthday.
- Ah! Thank you!

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:11.319
- Oh, look, a shiv!
- Yeah!

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.913
- Hey, homes.
- Mm! Mm!

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.469
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.476
Stanley! Honey bear!

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.835
I loved your letter!

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.719
I missed you so much.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:56.759
Before we go any further, there's
three little words I need to hear.

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.753
- I was wrong?
- Good boy!

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.438
It looks like
a nursery school picnic out there.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.079
It's Minton.

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:12.279
- What do you mean, it's Minton?
- Well, first he banned rape.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.635
It's to the point
that anybody gets beat up,

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.917
they run and join Minton's gang
and Minton beats up the bad guy.

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:21.152
The truth, he's got them too scared
to look at each other funny.

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:24.915
- We ain't had a fight in three days.
- I thought I saw Ingleberg fight

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.072
that big Mexican yesterday, Jesus.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:31.869
Oh, no, that was more in the nature
of a lovers' quarrel.

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:34.349
Ingleberg forgot their
two-week anniversary.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.114
That wasn't very nice of him, was it?

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.193
Well, they made up. You should
have seen the cake Ingleberg made.

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.749
- It was special...
- You get out of here right now

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:47.390
and get Minton up here!
You understand me? I mean right now!

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:50.597
Now hurry!

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.869
I'm not just saying this, but I think
that was the most amazing sex

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.679
we've ever had.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:01.479
I guess being away from me
this long made you crazy.

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.599
Well, yes, I guess.
The Master's opened my eyes, sexually.

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:08.991
<i>He showed me all these different
positions in the Kama Sutra.</i>

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:12.470
- The Master? You been seeing him?
- Yeah, he's staying at the house.

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.632
I've learned about massage
and strengthening my Kegels.

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.837
That sleazy son of a bitch!

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.230
- Minton, time's up.
- But Stan, I...

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:25.109
- Warden wants to see you now!
- Wait. I don't want you to see him.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:29.512
You tell Master Dickface I'm gonna get
out of here soon and kick his ass!

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.955
Don't tell him.
You're not allowed to see him.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.156
I said now, convict!

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.958
- Minton!
- Not allowed to see him!

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.236
- I love you, sweetie-cakes!
- Let's go.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.958
Cocksucker!

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.674
I'll bet you didn't know
I was part psychic.

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:57.918
That's right.
I'm able to see into the future.

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:02.438
- I didn't realise.
- Let me tell you what's going to happen

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.750
one week from today.

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:10.757
The board of governors
is gonna come to inspect the prison.

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:14.879
And something awful happens.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:19.272
Some prisoners find a way
to smuggle weapons into the yard.

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.954
And a full-scale riot breaks out.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:26.113
And as the prison board watches
in absolute horror,

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:30.239
my men are forced to shoot
into the yard in order

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:33.278
to end the melee.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:38.309
In the ensuing scandal,
the Board chooses to sell the property

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.756
to a Vietnamese family

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.559
based in San Pedro.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.871
And everybody lives happily ever after.

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.512
Especially me.

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:54.798
Now, if the events that I foretold

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.315
do not come to fruition...

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.151
...I will be very disappointed.

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.311
And when I get disappointed,

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:13.596
Mr Deng over there

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:18.311
likes to stomp on men's spines
like they was bubble wrap.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:36.071
I spent 35 years of my life

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:39.630
in this stinking cesspool.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:44.191
And I will not walk away
without something to show for it.

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.352
Your little prison reform
ends right now.

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:53.398
You play ball,
you might get yourself a parole hearing.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:56.154
How many will get killed?

01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:01.110
Who cares? They're all animals.

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.513
Bullard!

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:11.072
- Escort Mr Minton back to his cell.
- Yes, sir. Come on, Minton.

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:19.597
Stan, you ever have two Asian men
pounding your balls

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.513
after sex with a questionably
attractive older woman?

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:24.910
No, I can't say I have, Lew.

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:28.789
Madam Foreman won't return
any of my calls.

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:31.952
You better go for that deal
the warden offered you.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:36.716
- So there's nothing else I can do?
- I'm sorry, pal. It's over.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.075
<i>You're in real danger.</i>

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.879
Get yourself out of there
as soon as you can.

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.278
Bullard.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.352
Tell the warden I'll take his deal.

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.353
I want out of here.

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:27.355
Hey, Stan. The Nazis were saying
the Virgin Mary tortilla's a fake.

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:30.398
- That's not cool, homes.
- Hey, the Nazis were saying

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.152
the Virgin Mary has no power.

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:35.312
Constantine was pacifying
the Byzantine priest by giving him

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:39.029
a goddess to pray to. They've been
watching the History Channel.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:42.351
- What?
- What are you gonna do about it?

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:45.159
I'm not gonna do anything about it.

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.754
What's up with him, man?

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:51.798
Hey, Stan. Stan!

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:55.750
The Brazilians won't
stop calling Farib an Arab.

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.673
I'm not an Arab! I'm Persian.

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:01.912
What do I care?
You look like an Arab.

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:05.559
Hey, listen up! All of you!

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.992
You're all on your own!
You hear me?

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:12.549
I don't care what any of you
do to each other!

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:15.188
Hey, you guys!

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.158
An interracial book club.

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:23.152
You guys all hate each other.
So stop pretending you don't.

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:26.835
<i>- You don't know about Macbeth.
- Fuck you, motherfucker!</i>

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:51.751
Yeah, that's more like it. Yes, sir.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:09.953
Big Stan?

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.839
We need to talk.

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.758
I thought you cared about us.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.319
Well, I don't.

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:44.954
Hey, little cracker.

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:50.069
Why don't you sit over here,
my little white brother.

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:05.438
Here, have mine.

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.516
I'm gonna need to shave your head.

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:12.195
Put a couple little tattoos
on your forehead, huh?

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.513
Come on, eat up.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.435
I was wrong about you.

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:22.431
We all were.

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:27.316
Stay out of the yard tomorrow.
You hear me?

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:37.435
D-block houses some
of our most hardened offenders.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:42.037
But here, we have Oaksburg's
greatest rehabilitation story.

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:46.671
Stan Minton. Stan, I'd like for you
to meet the board of governors.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.514
Not going in the yard today, Stan?

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:53.831
- I don't feel well, warden.
- Maybe this will make you feel better.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.754
Due to Stan's exemplary behaviour,
the parole board has agreed

01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:00.229
to meet with him today.

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.428
Well, we better be moving along.

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:11.638
The shit goes down at 12.30.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:15.998
At 12.35,
I'm in the real estate business.

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.710
Stan! Honey!

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.917
- I'll deal with you in a minute.
- Everything OK?

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:56.513
Both of you.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:03.553
Next up is prisoner 5824.

01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.879
In the matter of Stanley Minton.
You have your files.

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:14.188
In his time here, Minton
has accrued an exemplary record.

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:17.716
And let it be noted,
he's a first-time non-violent offender.

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:25.789
Hold up!

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:29.077
Before we vote, Mr Minton, is there
anything you'd like to add?

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:32.357
I'd just like to say, um...

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.556
...l've really learned a lot.

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.075
And I'm ready to get back to work.

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.750
Good, we like to hear that.

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:45.157
Here's the yard where the prisoners
come to exercise.

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:48.756
That's where Charlie the Fly
tried to fly over the wall.

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:52.071
Well, in light of Warden Gasque's
recommendation,

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:55.596
I think we have a pretty
clear-cut case for parole.

01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:00.275
Mr Minton?

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:05.797
How would you feel
about getting out of here today?

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:11.512
Mr Minton?

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.192
Did I mention I'm in real estate?

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:21.796
I got my eye on some property
real close by here

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:25.999
- I can't wait to develop.
- Hm. That's commendable.

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:29.630
You know, while I was in here,
also, I joined a biker gang.

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:32.519
Satan's Paedophiles.

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:34.671
Anyway, they said when I get out,

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:37.673
they'd love to camp next
to the grammar school near here.

01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:39.193
I hope that's not a problem.

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:43.672
They're pretty cool guys, except
when they drink and do crystal meth.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.353
Which is almost every weekend.

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:50.116
But most of the people I sell to,
they don't need to know about that.

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:54.239
'Cause, uh, they're old ladies, mostly.
Not too good with fine print,

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:55.469
if you get my drift.

01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:00.675
Tell me, is your grandma still alive?
I bet I could make her a sweet deal.

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.831
By the time I'm through with her,

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.596
she'll give handjobs behind the pharmacy
to pay for arthritis medication.

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:12.232
Two at a time, you know?
Stuff you see in pornos.

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:18.159
Anyway, that's a nice top you have on.
Seriously.

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.914
Mind lowering it?
I'd love to see some boobage.

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:24.958
Let me see that, woman. That's sexy.
Let me see that.

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:28.271
Let me touch one of them.
Let me touch one of them. Can I? Please?

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:30.954
Parole denied!
Take him back to his cell!

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:34.795
What colour are your nipples?
I bet they're pink! Light brown?

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:36.393
Dollar size or quarter?

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:41.235
Stan, did we win?

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:43.152
Let go of me. I'm in a hurry.

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:44.639
Have no fear, Stanley.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:48.349
I will continue to take care
of your wife while you're gone.

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:51.034
- Thanks a lot, pal.
- No thanks needed.

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.873
I cherish Mindy's company.

01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:57.794
Since my addiction to cigarettes
made me impotent,

01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:00.872
I've had very little contact
with the fair sex.

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:03.153
Impotent?

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.470
I used to think smoking was cool,

01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:11.158
but a limp dick spells nerd
in any language.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:14.232
- You're impotent. That's great!
- Not really.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.548
Baby, I love you.
I'll write to you as soon as I can.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.438
OK.

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:24.556
That's my boy.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:26.599
Love you, baby!

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:30.514
- He's running!
- Code red!

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:32.955
Watch the prisoners file in.

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:08.477
The Master has taught you well.

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:12.030
Don't tell me.
You studied with The Master too?

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:16.716
- I am his number one.
- I didn't see that coming.

01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:19.713
There are many things
you will not see coming.

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:22.348
Oh, really? Like what?

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:32.515
Hmm.

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.156
- Whoa. Take it easy.
- I have been taking it easy.

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:51.668
I wanna break me off
some chocolate.

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.637
Come on, hold the line.

01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:58.199
- Top you up here?
- Thank you very much.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.070
How are you doing?

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:02.229
Yeah, good.

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:21.397
I don't think The Master
prepares you for this.

01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:28.669
Here comes the eagle.

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:00.712
Are those weapons?

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.038
Hoo, hoo, hoo!

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:12.798
Ah!

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:19.353
Somebody didn't strengthen
their titties.

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:23.273
Whoo!

01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:31.153
It looks like a riot.

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.152
Whoo!

01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:00.835
- I celebrated too early!
- Ah!

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:15.559
Warden, can't you do anything
to stop this?

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:19.713
Bullard, prepare to fire.

01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:51.079
Whoo!

01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:53.834
Whoo! Whoo!

01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:58.348
Whoo!

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:00.713
Finger of death.

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:08.993
That's you.

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:17.917
I don't know if The Master
prepared you for this.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.672
Hoo!

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:34.476
- Ready to dance, motherfuckers?
- Handle your shit, bitch!

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:35.789
Fire at will.

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:38.715
Don't fight!

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.399
Why aren't you firing?

01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:41.192
- Fire that weapon.
- I can't do it, boss.

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:45.710
Well, why the hell not?

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.269
They're just dancing.

01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:59.191
Give me that rifle.

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.158
What the hell are you doing?

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:08.673
Restoring order.

01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:12.234
They've clearly lost their minds.

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.152
Warden, it's over.

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:17.998
Look at all these witnesses.

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:20.435
It's over, warden.

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:26.312
You did this to me.

01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:46.118
- Where did that come from?
- What do you think I've been doing

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:48.430
with The Master for the last six months?

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.477
Thank God.

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:52.312
You did good with Dang.

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:55.153
But you're still
my number two student.

01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:58.790
- Number two?
- She'll kick your ass.

01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:03.156
I might like that.

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:06.950
Ready position!

01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:09.031
Focus!

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:10.872
Lock! Punch!

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.315
- Kick! Double punch!
- Yah!

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:16.119
Ready position!

01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:18.157
Lock! Punch!

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:20.993
- Kick! Double punch!
- Yah!

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:23.720
- It's time, Minton.
- Just a minute, warden.

01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:26.519
Looks great, guys.
Thanks, Robbie.

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:29.717
OK, everybody, I gotta go now.

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:33.634
I'll miss you too.

01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:37.190
I want you guys to be especially nice
to our newest inmate

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:40.750
and best disbarred lawyer
in the world, Lew Popper.

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:43.639
- Welcome aboard!
- Lew!

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:47.952
- Is the ban on rape still in effect?
- I'm pretty sure.

01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:50.315
Hey!

01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:54.837
Permission to give Big Stan
a group hug.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.911
- Permission granted.
- Come on, gang!

01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:08.355
Hey, little homey,
thanks for giving me my teeth back.

01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:11.796
My pleasure.

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:18.994
- Where you going, cracker?
- I'm going home, man.

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:22.869
- I think Big Stan is staying here.
- Oh, yeah?

01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:26.949
Oh, shit!

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:32.434
I'm Big Stan.
No more rape.

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.352
Aw, very creepy.

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:36.635
My cracker.

01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:39.188
Be good, huh?

01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:42.750
Bye, Stan!

01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:45.476
Hey. Hey.

01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:49.469
Whoo!

01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:53.030
- Big man.
- Bye, Big Stan.

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:54.713
Say bye.

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:01.675
Stan!

01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:06.395
Sweetie.

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:08.437
Hey, handsome.

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:10.716
- Where's Mindy Junior?
- In the car.

01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:13.838
- She's being kind of a brat.
- Isn't the nanny helping?

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.594
Yeah. I think he
still sneaks cigarettes.

01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:19.354
Yeah? I'll talk to him.

01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:27.319
Hi, precious. Hi, The Master.

01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:29.994
- Say hello to your father, child.
- Hi.

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:33.391
- Rumour is you're sneaking smokes.
- Shh.

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:37.590
- How's her technique?
- She stinks.

01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.432
But so did you at first.

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:42.353
You sure? I don't remember that.

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:44.317
- Stan!
- OK, baby.

01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:46.277
Let's go,
sweetie!

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:54.007
Whoo-hoo!
