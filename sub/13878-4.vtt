Tonight's episode...
Oh, man, that sun is

00:39.630 --> 00:41.400
so gnarly.

00:41.530 --> 00:43.160
Makes me want to lay out and

00:43.200 --> 00:47.100
catch some serious rays on my abs.

00:47.140 --> 00:51.370
Oh, hey, babe.

00:51.440 --> 00:51.810
Lesbian!

00:51.840 --> 00:53.340
How can you tell?

00:53.380 --> 00:54.610
I ain't got no good gaydar.

00:54.650 --> 00:56.180
Well, usually if she's

00:56.250 --> 00:57.380
a hot broad and she's not

00:57.450 --> 00:58.810
fondling my buttocks, that means

00:58.880 --> 01:00.280
she plays for the other team.

01:00.320 --> 01:03.020
So basically all women are lesbians.

01:03.090 --> 01:04.550
She is. She is.

01:04.620 --> 01:05.890
Those ones over there are.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.050
Her, her, her.

01:07.090 --> 01:08.360
What about that one?

01:08.420 --> 01:09.460
Definitely her.

01:09.490 --> 01:10.890
How about that one?

01:10.930 --> 01:11.820
Whoa, her.

01:11.890 --> 01:14.360
Her, her, her, she's
practically a man.

01:14.430 --> 01:16.630
What about that one over there?

01:16.700 --> 01:18.070
Hey, how about you, toots?

01:18.100 --> 01:19.170
You want to hit this?

01:19.230 --> 01:20.100
She heard me.

01:20.140 --> 01:21.100
She's a lesbian.

01:21.170 --> 01:22.900
Her, her, her.

01:22.970 --> 01:24.070
They know when they're young.

01:24.140 --> 01:26.010
Now, please, go get the dog.

01:28.410 --> 01:30.810
I think the dog is dangerous, shake.

01:30.880 --> 01:31.680
Gimme that.

01:31.720 --> 01:32.350
Ow.

01:32.420 --> 01:33.680
Hey, that's my elbow, boy!

01:33.720 --> 01:35.250
Smell that meat, boy.

01:35.320 --> 01:35.890
You smell it?

01:35.950 --> 01:37.450
You play your cards right, and

01:37.520 --> 01:38.620
tonight you shall feast.

01:38.690 --> 01:40.160
Open the cage.

01:40.190 --> 01:42.160
I think this is a bad idea, shake.

01:42.190 --> 01:43.530
These stuck-up hippie

01:43.600 --> 01:45.060
bitches are gonna be glistening

01:45.100 --> 01:46.430
when they see me play my bongos

01:46.500 --> 01:47.430
next to my dog.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.070
Open the cage!

01:50.100 --> 01:51.170
All right.

01:52.570 --> 01:53.170
Uh-oh.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.870
Get off me!

01:54.910 --> 01:56.240
Aah! Aah! Get it off!

01:56.310 --> 01:57.510
You ain't gonna get

01:57.540 --> 01:58.880
laid just 'cause you have a dog.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.040
I know, that's why I

02:00.080 --> 02:01.780
brought this frisbee,
to make us look fun!

02:01.810 --> 02:02.880
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:02.950 --> 02:04.080
You definitely ain't gonna get

02:04.150 --> 02:05.250
laid kicking a dog in public.

02:05.280 --> 02:06.520
Women respond to

02:06.590 --> 02:07.690
control, and that is what I am

02:07.720 --> 02:09.520
exhibiting to this dog.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.160
Go on. Let go of him, meatwad.

02:11.190 --> 02:12.620
All right.

02:12.690 --> 02:14.120
Go get it, you dumbass.

02:14.990 --> 02:16.390
Why did you let go of him?!

02:16.430 --> 02:17.590
Get him off me! Get it off!

02:17.660 --> 02:19.530
Why did you let go of
the dog like that?

02:19.600 --> 02:20.800
I don't know, man.

02:20.870 --> 02:22.300
I think you need to stop using

02:22.330 --> 02:23.300
that rib-eye shampoo.

02:23.330 --> 02:25.570
It's a porterhouse
conditioner with aloe!

02:25.600 --> 02:26.870
Yo, bro. Your disc.

02:26.900 --> 02:29.670
Well aware of what I
own, okay, cool guy?

02:29.710 --> 02:33.040
Wow, I got nude when
I saw your tattoos.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.210
Right on, right on.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.310
I'm on the pill.

02:35.380 --> 02:36.110
What pill?

02:36.150 --> 02:37.580
Well, you're a lesbian!

02:37.610 --> 02:39.150
If she's a lesbian,

02:39.180 --> 02:40.480
then what's she doing with that

02:40.520 --> 02:41.520
cool tattoo guy?

02:41.580 --> 02:43.480
Because he's obviously

02:43.520 --> 02:45.320
a woman trapped inside a man's

02:45.350 --> 02:46.490
impeccably chiseled body.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.060
Right now it looks

02:48.090 --> 02:50.330
like he's trapped inside
that girl's body.

02:50.360 --> 02:51.660
Oh, now he's out.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.600
Wait, now he's back in again.

02:53.660 --> 02:54.860
Wait, now he's back out.

02:54.930 --> 02:55.830
Now he's back in.

02:55.870 --> 02:58.570
Get that dog over here
so I can blame him!

02:58.600 --> 03:00.870
Shenandoah, come!

03:01.700 --> 03:02.940
No! Not to the lake!

03:03.010 --> 03:05.140
There's no ass in the lake!

03:05.170 --> 03:07.010
Clearly, I need to get laid.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.580
Otherwise why would I have done this?

03:09.640 --> 03:11.480
Well, I think Carl

03:11.550 --> 03:13.380
might have a service that he uses.

03:13.450 --> 03:15.210
A woman of the night?

03:15.250 --> 03:17.850
No, it's the thrill
of the hunt for me.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.220
Hell, that's half the orgasm.

03:19.290 --> 03:21.350
Well, then you ain't
even halfway there.

03:21.390 --> 03:23.090
Look, the dog can be trained.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.020
I know that now.

03:24.090 --> 03:25.490
And the bandana was working big

03:25.560 --> 03:27.030
time from what I could tell.

03:27.100 --> 03:29.200
So you're gonna do this again?

03:29.260 --> 03:30.560
No, of course not.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.830
Not until I get a
really bitchin' tattoo.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.470
Are we ready to do this?

03:34.540 --> 03:35.940
Meatwad's gonna hook

03:36.000 --> 03:37.940
me up from his cereal box.

03:37.970 --> 03:39.740
And the best thing

03:39.780 --> 03:42.210
is it come off in a bubble bath

03:42.240 --> 03:43.280
before night-night.

03:43.350 --> 03:46.110
So it's the illusion
of danger without the

03:46.180 --> 03:46.910
commitment.

03:46.950 --> 03:47.280
I like it.

03:48.220 --> 03:49.750
All right, let's unleash the dog.

03:49.820 --> 03:51.620
Uh, let's do a dry run first.

03:51.650 --> 03:52.890
I don't think that we have to ...

03:52.920 --> 03:55.720
unchain that dog right now.

03:55.790 --> 03:57.720
All right, then.

03:57.760 --> 03:58.890
No, no, no! Stop!

03:58.930 --> 04:00.730
Anywhere but the freeway!

04:01.630 --> 04:03.460
Yes, I'm looking for a tattoo

04:03.530 --> 04:05.460
that will show that I'm totally

04:05.500 --> 04:07.370
in control, and I also want it

04:07.400 --> 04:09.370
to make women want to sex me up.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.470
How about this?

04:10.540 --> 04:12.810
It says "get caught in my web.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.740
And get out when we're done."

04:15.580 --> 04:18.079
Where does it say that?

04:18.110 --> 04:20.350
It doesn't literally say that.

04:20.380 --> 04:22.180
Could I get it to say that?

04:22.250 --> 04:23.520
So that my agenda is properly

04:23.550 --> 04:25.250
laid out in case I get sued or

04:25.290 --> 04:27.950
if I have to explain
it to a stupid girl?

04:27.990 --> 04:30.890
Okay, how about this on your neck?

04:30.960 --> 04:31.890
It's sanskrit.

04:31.960 --> 04:34.160
It means "extremely gullible."

04:34.230 --> 04:35.730
Yeah, that's me all

04:35.760 --> 04:38.630
over, but can I get it
in English, please?

04:38.700 --> 04:40.260
I don't know any sanskrit women.

04:40.330 --> 04:40.900
Sure.

04:40.970 --> 04:42.270
What kind of price range are you

04:42.340 --> 04:43.000
looking at?

04:43.070 --> 04:45.540
I can go anywhere from $3 to $5.

04:45.610 --> 04:48.810
Obviously cheaper, but
you know, up to $5.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.340
And I'm gonna need your

04:50.410 --> 04:51.710
corporate rate, and I'm

04:51.780 --> 04:53.340
expecting a AAA discount.

04:53.380 --> 04:56.720
I have only one tattoo
in that price range.

04:56.780 --> 04:58.420
But we have to wait for a

04:58.490 --> 05:00.420
lightning storm to install it.

05:00.450 --> 05:01.890
Install it?

05:01.920 --> 05:03.890
Yes.

05:03.930 --> 05:05.160
Install it.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.600
Okay, I'll wait.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.340
I'm just gonna read this

05:15.400 --> 05:18.240
"up yours" tattoo...
Over and over again.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.510
Ah, hell no.

05:23.580 --> 05:25.140
Where'd you get that scooter, man?

05:25.210 --> 05:26.150
You mean my chopper?

05:27.510 --> 05:30.780
I probably ripped it
off some biker gang.

05:30.850 --> 05:32.250
Or I may have purchased it with

05:32.320 --> 05:33.420
some sketchy finance.

05:33.450 --> 05:35.920
Either way, it's a part of me.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.150
It really defines who I am.

05:37.220 --> 05:38.320
Who are you?

05:38.360 --> 05:39.960
I'm the guy that gets

05:39.990 --> 05:41.590
what he wants, when he wants it,

05:41.630 --> 05:42.760
and I decide how much I want

05:42.790 --> 05:44.190
before I'm full and I feel bloated.

05:44.230 --> 05:44.960
You follow me?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.130
I think you should
wear a helmet, though.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.460
You wear a helmet.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.030
For you walking around, bumping

05:50.100 --> 05:51.130
into your bookcases.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.500
Rules are for nerds.

05:52.570 --> 05:53.400
Ow.

05:54.310 --> 05:55.310
Whoa.

05:55.340 --> 05:56.310
You got a tattoo?

05:56.370 --> 05:57.310
Oh, this?

05:57.380 --> 05:58.780
I don't know. Yeah.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.740
Probably on one of my binges.

06:00.780 --> 06:01.910
It says "danger city.

06:01.950 --> 06:03.850
Population me."

06:03.920 --> 06:06.480
Well, I think it says,
"I'm insecure."

06:06.520 --> 06:07.650
Yeah, well, I'm headed

06:07.690 --> 06:09.590
off to the park to dip my dick.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.190
When I get back with a couple

06:11.220 --> 06:12.460
hot tamales begging for my

06:12.490 --> 06:14.090
sauce, I need you two gay wads

06:14.130 --> 06:15.490
to clear out of the hallway.

06:15.530 --> 06:16.990
'Cause women like it when I

06:17.030 --> 06:17.930
show them where I live.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.460
You want your dog with you?

06:20.270 --> 06:21.200
Dear God, no.

06:21.270 --> 06:23.030
Keep that thing chained
in the crawl space.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.170
Bake him a glass pie.

06:26.210 --> 06:28.310
Oh, man.

06:28.380 --> 06:30.210
Not many rays today.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.840
So I guess I'm just gonna have

06:31.910 --> 06:36.380
to hacky-sack solamente, broskis.

06:36.420 --> 06:38.020
You're never gonna get any

06:38.050 --> 06:39.190
action in this downpour.

06:39.220 --> 06:40.820
Yes, I-I know that.

06:40.860 --> 06:43.720
Who...
Who is it I'm speaking with?

06:43.760 --> 06:45.820
It's me, freedom cobra.

06:48.030 --> 06:49.830
Oh, you talk?

06:49.900 --> 06:54.000
I was not aware that you did that.

06:54.770 --> 06:57.540
Were you always riding a missile?

06:57.570 --> 06:58.200
Oh, this?

06:58.270 --> 07:00.840
I got some tattoos
while you was asleep.

07:00.910 --> 07:02.540
I think they say a lot about me,

07:02.610 --> 07:03.480
about who I am.

07:03.550 --> 07:04.880
You added on to it?

07:04.910 --> 07:06.880
Look, something I need you to do.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.550
I need to feed.

07:08.620 --> 07:11.020
Well, what is it you
think you need to eat?

07:11.090 --> 07:11.920
Calcium.

07:11.950 --> 07:13.790
Oh, well, milk is an

07:13.820 --> 07:15.090
excellent source of calcium.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.460
Oh, yeah?

07:17.160 --> 07:18.930
So are skulls.

07:18.990 --> 07:20.460
Bones.

07:20.530 --> 07:23.630
Human bones.

07:23.670 --> 07:26.530
Um, I have a dog you could eat.

07:26.570 --> 07:28.870
All right, then, we'll start there.

07:28.900 --> 07:30.740
Bobby?

07:30.810 --> 07:31.740
Here, boy!

07:32.970 --> 07:33.910
Shake, you seen Bobby?

07:33.980 --> 07:35.710
Ah, you know, he probably ...

07:36.340 --> 07:37.280
he probably just ...

07:38.480 --> 07:39.780
he probably ran away ...

07:43.620 --> 07:44.620
ah, here's his collar.

07:44.650 --> 07:46.720
You add on to that tattoo of yours?

07:46.760 --> 07:48.460
Why, did it do something?

07:48.530 --> 07:49.620
What's it doing now?

07:49.660 --> 07:53.900
It was looking at me.

07:53.930 --> 07:55.960
And then when I looked at it, it

07:56.000 --> 07:59.130
looked away.

07:59.170 --> 08:00.970
What would you say if

08:01.010 --> 08:05.040
I told you I may or may not have

08:05.080 --> 08:05.870
eaten your dog?

08:05.940 --> 08:07.940
Well, I may or may

08:07.980 --> 08:09.710
not be pretty mad at you,

08:09.780 --> 08:10.980
depending on the outcome.

08:11.020 --> 08:12.680
Well, it's not like I

08:12.720 --> 08:14.080
give one flying fart what you

08:14.150 --> 08:15.990
think, but I'm sure
that didn't happen.

08:16.020 --> 08:17.150
Now, run along, and keep your

08:17.220 --> 08:17.960
chin up, buddy.

08:17.990 --> 08:18.860
Okay.

08:18.890 --> 08:21.130
We'll find your little dog.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.790
Yeah.

08:22.830 --> 08:24.060
When you defecate.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.060
Damn it!

08:26.100 --> 08:26.800
I knew it.

08:26.870 --> 08:29.700
In some trance-like
state, I ate a dog.

08:29.740 --> 08:32.340
Daddy's hungry.

08:32.370 --> 08:33.440
Daddy needs meat.

08:33.510 --> 08:35.710
No, I can't eat meatwad.

08:35.740 --> 08:38.140
He's been my roommate
for, like, 10 years.

08:38.179 --> 08:39.580
I'll get in trouble.

08:39.610 --> 08:43.580
Hey, daddy needs what daddy needs.

08:43.620 --> 08:45.050
What do you want?

08:45.120 --> 08:46.050
Come on, man.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.650
I don't always have to want something.

08:47.690 --> 08:49.220
You know what, you're right.

08:49.290 --> 08:49.920
That was rude.

08:49.950 --> 08:51.220
Come on in. Wipe your feet.

08:51.260 --> 08:53.790
Can I, uh, hang up
your chainsaw for you?

08:53.860 --> 08:55.860
Uh, nah, that's okay.

08:55.930 --> 08:56.860
I'll just hold it.

08:56.930 --> 08:58.030
All right, whatever.

08:58.060 --> 08:59.190
So what's up? What's going on?

09:00.030 --> 09:00.960
You're not gonna start that up

09:01.030 --> 09:01.830
in here are you?

09:01.870 --> 09:02.400
Why?

09:02.470 --> 09:03.930
Is that a problem or something?

09:03.970 --> 09:05.030
All right, fine.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.140
So what's been going on?

09:07.200 --> 09:08.040
How are things?

09:08.110 --> 09:09.370
Why are you coming towards me in

09:09.410 --> 09:10.370
that manner?

09:10.410 --> 09:12.780
I just wanted you to
see this new beauty.

09:12.810 --> 09:13.910
Check it out.

09:13.950 --> 09:16.050
Nice and slow.

09:16.110 --> 09:17.950
Hey, have you seen Carl, man?

09:17.980 --> 09:19.120
'Cause, uh, this kind of looks

09:19.150 --> 09:20.220
like his hand over here.

09:20.250 --> 09:21.050
No, why?

09:21.120 --> 09:21.850
You mean alive?

09:21.890 --> 09:22.850
Yes, alive.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.650
A census worker came
by and was asking.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.190
Well, was he made of meat?

09:26.230 --> 09:27.860
What, the census worker?

09:28.930 --> 09:30.500
Of course he was.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.030
All humans are made of meat.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.400
Good gracious, man.

09:34.430 --> 09:35.730
Did you add on to that tattoo?

09:35.770 --> 09:37.840
Uh, you get one, you want another.

09:37.900 --> 09:38.940
God, it stretches

09:39.010 --> 09:40.310
all the way around the back.

09:40.340 --> 09:42.310
It's like I'm in the yakuza, right?

09:42.380 --> 09:42.940
What's it doing?

09:42.980 --> 09:45.380
Wait a minute, this
looks like us, man.

09:45.450 --> 09:46.940
We're being fed into a grinder.

09:47.010 --> 09:48.280
And poured into the

09:48.310 --> 09:50.280
mouth of your winged cobra!

09:50.320 --> 09:51.550
Well, I at lease hope you're

09:51.580 --> 09:53.450
getting laid from that damn thing.

09:53.490 --> 09:55.490
The sad thing is I'm not.

09:55.550 --> 09:58.820
In fact, I think I may
be eating people.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.360
You're eating people?!

10:00.390 --> 10:00.830
Shh!

10:00.890 --> 10:01.660
He can hear us.

10:01.690 --> 10:02.830
Who can hear us?

10:02.860 --> 10:04.460
The freedom cobra, dummy.

10:04.530 --> 10:05.160
He's alive.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.570
You got to help me get him off.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.670
It went well.

10:07.740 --> 10:10.370
Unfortunately, our lasers were

10:10.440 --> 10:12.270
no match for freedom cobra.

10:12.310 --> 10:14.740
Dude, we paid you $1,200 cash.

10:14.810 --> 10:15.640
It's a tattoo.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.740
You just burn it off.

10:16.780 --> 10:19.080
Well, that's not what the tattoo said.

10:19.110 --> 10:21.250
Well, what did the tattoo say?

10:21.280 --> 10:22.380
The tattoo told me to cut off

10:22.420 --> 10:25.290
my hands so your buddy could eat them.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.450
So, what do you think?

10:27.490 --> 10:29.420
We plumped up his lips, and

10:29.460 --> 10:31.260
we gave him some Botox here,

10:31.290 --> 10:33.330
here, here, here, here, here,

10:33.360 --> 10:35.630
here, here, here, here, here,

10:35.700 --> 10:37.530
here, here, here, and here.

10:37.570 --> 10:38.730
See?!

10:38.770 --> 10:40.370
No more frown lines!

10:40.440 --> 10:42.270
Now no one can tell I'm sad...

10:42.300 --> 10:44.110
After I've eaten them!
