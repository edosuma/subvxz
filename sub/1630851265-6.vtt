that he thought he trusted,

49:05.177 --> 49:06.439
he can no longer trust.

♪

49:10.139 --> 49:11.836
And the thing for him,
in this episode,

49:11.879 --> 49:13.272
is he just wants to find out

49:13.316 --> 49:16.101
how she's involved
and to what degree,

49:16.145 --> 49:18.190
what her motivations are,
and, really, like, who is she,

49:18.234 --> 49:19.322
what makes her tick?

49:19.365 --> 49:21.237
There is something.

49:21.280 --> 49:23.587
Something I haven't been
honest with you about.

49:23.630 --> 49:25.937
And he really just
needs answers from her,

49:25.981 --> 49:28.026
without actually coming out
and asking her,

49:28.070 --> 49:31.247
and, by the end of the episode,
he does get those answers

49:31.290 --> 49:33.727
and I think it's
pretty shocking for him.

49:33.771 --> 49:34.946
Jadis:
Jennifer!

Staff Sergeant.

49:39.907 --> 49:41.735
Warrant Officer Stokes.

49:41.779 --> 49:43.433
The decision
to bring Jadis on,

49:43.476 --> 49:46.044
you know, I do think
the promise of a universe

49:46.088 --> 49:48.960
is that all these different
worlds are connected

49:49.004 --> 49:51.484
and it really felt
like a great opportunity

49:51.528 --> 49:53.878
to start tying
some threads together.

49:53.921 --> 49:57.708
I created a little society
quite quickly.

49:57.751 --> 49:59.057
I can believe that.

49:59.101 --> 50:00.972
We really wanted
to amp up the stakes a bit

50:01.016 --> 50:03.148
for the back half of Season 2.

50:03.192 --> 50:06.499
You know, we've established
Elizabeth as this villain,

50:06.543 --> 50:08.980
but, at the end of the day,
like she is Huck's mother

50:09.024 --> 50:11.069
and she cares about Huck.

50:11.113 --> 50:12.940
Until further notice,

50:12.984 --> 50:14.333
you'll be answering
to me.

50:14.377 --> 50:16.901
And so there really
was something to the idea

50:16.944 --> 50:19.469
of bringing in a character
that we've known before,

50:19.512 --> 50:21.819
but we don't know what
this character is capable of.

50:21.862 --> 50:25.214
So, you were ambitious,
even as a survivor.

50:25.257 --> 50:27.477
I really want the audience
to look at Jadis

50:27.520 --> 50:30.393
and, even though we know who she
is and where she's come from,

50:30.436 --> 50:33.265
we don't really know
what she stands for anymore.

50:33.309 --> 50:35.963
I know that
the Civic Republic is

50:36.007 --> 50:37.878
the last light
of the world.

50:37.922 --> 50:41.317

a new era on this planet.

♪

50:43.667 --> 50:45.103
It's your purpose, too.

50:45.147 --> 50:47.410
And so that really puts her
at odds with Huck,

50:47.453 --> 50:48.846
who is a former friend.

50:48.889 --> 50:50.108
So she's there, really,

50:50.152 --> 50:53.155
to remind Huck who she was

50:53.198 --> 50:56.767
and to make sure that who she
was is still who she is.

50:56.810 --> 50:58.421
So what's our
best way in?

50:58.464 --> 51:01.032
This is the first episode,
you know, we've seen,

51:01.076 --> 51:02.816
since the end of last season,

51:02.860 --> 51:05.341
where Huck and Felix
are actually working together.

51:05.384 --> 51:07.169
They have this mission
and they have to be

51:07.212 --> 51:09.736
on the same side for this,
for it to work.

51:09.780 --> 51:11.086
Wait for my go.

51:11.129 --> 51:12.478
Or don't.

51:12.522 --> 51:13.871
But, really, what this mission

51:13.914 --> 51:15.351
comes down to, for both of them,

51:15.394 --> 51:18.528
is trust --
do they trust each other?

Felix was stuck
in that freezer.

51:27.667 --> 51:29.930
Felix thought that, maybe,
she had changed her mind

51:29.974 --> 51:32.368
and there's --
there's a world where, maybe,

51:32.411 --> 51:34.370
Huck did, for a moment.

51:34.413 --> 51:37.024
Huck, come on,
talk to me.

We see her
beside that transformer.

She's about to be exposed
and it's really hitting her,

51:42.813 --> 51:45.120
in that moment,
the choice that she's made.

51:45.163 --> 51:47.774
And, for Felix,
he doesn't know what to believe.

51:47.818 --> 51:50.212
He wants to believe
that she's a good person,

he has doubts as well.

51:52.605 --> 51:54.085
Shit!

51:54.129 --> 51:56.653

that Huck comes through.

it's worth,
