WEBVTT

00:04.290 --> 00:06.667
-[Ben] Previously on Siren.
-Bring it in!

00:06.670 --> 00:08.035
We caught something
out there.

00:08.040 --> 00:09.029
[tires screech]

00:09.040 --> 00:11.247
Oh. Hey.

00:11.250 --> 00:12.239
[Ben] This is Ryn.

00:13.710 --> 00:15.029
Kind of hard
to believe someone

00:15.040 --> 00:16.450
when they tell
you they just saw...

00:16.460 --> 00:17.870
[Maddie] A mermaid.

00:17.880 --> 00:19.529
There's something else.

00:19.540 --> 00:20.996
There's another one?

00:21.000 --> 00:25.073
Sisters? Is that
who you're looking for?

00:25.080 --> 00:26.456
[Xander] Hey, stop!

00:29.080 --> 00:30.240
[Xander]
But I saw her.

00:30.250 --> 00:31.740
Ben, get down here.

00:31.750 --> 00:32.739
We're gonna go get her.

00:32.750 --> 00:35.036
Unh! Aah!

00:35.040 --> 00:36.450
-Xan!
-Dad!

00:36.460 --> 00:39.111
They kill your father.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.997
-Xander?
-I'm worried about him.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.240
Stop!

00:42.250 --> 00:43.615
[Ryn screams]

00:43.620 --> 00:45.531
You know the myths
about a Siren song?

00:45.540 --> 00:47.701
It gets inside your head.

00:47.710 --> 00:49.325
Will you sing to me again?

00:49.330 --> 00:51.821
You're comparing me
to your mother?

00:51.830 --> 00:53.491
I guess maybe I am.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.492
It's not the relationship
I want to have.

00:56.500 --> 00:58.661
Sister's new home.

01:00.620 --> 01:02.668
Ryn's, too.

01:52.290 --> 01:53.416
[muffled boom]

01:53.420 --> 01:55.957
[rumbling]

01:57.540 --> 02:01.203
[piercing sound waves pulsing]

02:01.210 --> 02:02.325
Aah!

02:05.460 --> 02:07.030
[placid high-pitched call]

02:08.420 --> 02:11.492
[song playing,
woman vocalizing]

02:16.080 --> 02:18.241
Yeah, the river

02:20.380 --> 02:22.826
Pulls me under

02:24.210 --> 02:29.034
Yeah, the river

02:29.040 --> 02:32.112
Pulls me under

02:32.120 --> 02:35.874
[Siren song echoing]

02:36.880 --> 02:37.995
Come on, Ben.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.706
[Siren song continuing]

02:39.710 --> 02:41.109
[screech]

02:42.620 --> 02:48.616
[Siren song echoing]

02:55.620 --> 02:56.609
Oh!

02:56.620 --> 02:58.247
Aah!

02:58.250 --> 03:02.072
[groaning]

03:12.290 --> 03:13.325
[twig snaps]

03:47.750 --> 03:49.160
[gasp] God!

03:50.170 --> 03:51.319
You scared me.

03:51.330 --> 03:52.319
You follow.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.701
Just wanted to see you.

03:57.710 --> 04:02.374
I... wasn't even
sure If you were
still here in town.

04:02.380 --> 04:04.166
I stay.

04:04.170 --> 04:06.206
Others go back.

04:08.330 --> 04:10.161
I didn't get a chance to...

04:10.170 --> 04:11.239
to tell you.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.411
I'm sorry.

04:20.960 --> 04:21.995
Sorry?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.377
I can't stop
thinking about it.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.200
Your sister?

04:30.170 --> 04:33.207
I didn't mean
to kill her, okay?

04:33.210 --> 04:34.871
IfI could go back

04:36.210 --> 04:39.031
and change everything, I--

04:39.040 --> 04:40.075
I would.

04:41.790 --> 04:43.166
You can do this?

04:44.120 --> 04:45.610
No.

04:45.620 --> 04:46.780
[softly hisses]

04:46.790 --> 04:48.417
Then why you say this?

04:48.420 --> 04:50.957
I'm just trying
to explain, okay?

04:50.960 --> 04:52.029
I was crazy.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.996
I was out of my mind.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.037
But you weren't
on that boat, okay?

04:57.040 --> 04:58.371
You didn't see it.

05:00.170 --> 05:01.455
They killed my father.

05:01.460 --> 05:04.202
They keep my sister
in cage.

05:04.210 --> 05:05.871
Hurt her.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.826
This is why
they kill your father.

05:11.170 --> 05:12.740
[hisses]

05:12.750 --> 05:14.706
Where are you going?

05:16.040 --> 05:17.530
To see my sister.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.076
Oh, hi!

05:34.120 --> 05:35.610
[sighs]

05:35.620 --> 05:36.746
Mads!

05:38.170 --> 05:39.819
-Mads!
-Hey, Mom.

05:39.830 --> 05:41.707
Hi.

05:41.710 --> 05:43.075
I'm sorry.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.286
I didn't realize
that you were here.

05:44.290 --> 05:45.609
I must have fallen asleep.

05:45.620 --> 05:47.167
-It's fine.
-You know me.

05:48.420 --> 05:49.535
I'm out cold.

05:49.540 --> 05:51.826
Yeah, I remember.

05:51.830 --> 05:54.071
Thanks for picking me up.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.490
You have bags, or...

05:55.500 --> 05:57.491
Oh, just this one.
Traveling light.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.325
So I'm gonna drop you
at the house.

06:00.330 --> 06:01.319
See you later
for dinner?

06:01.330 --> 06:02.820
Yeah, sure,
whatever works.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.576
I'm happy to see you.

06:07.620 --> 06:09.167
I'm glad.

06:14.170 --> 06:16.912
So what the hell
happened up there, Ben?

06:16.920 --> 06:19.070
Uh, I lost my footing.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.707
You were climbing alone.

06:20.710 --> 06:23.201
I wasn't thinking.

06:23.210 --> 06:25.166
You know, if you'd have hit
your head on that rock

06:25.170 --> 06:26.706
instead of your shoulder,
you'd be dead right now.

06:26.710 --> 06:28.780
-You realize that, right?
-Yeah.

06:28.790 --> 06:30.109
[groans]

06:30.120 --> 06:32.111
Little worried about you.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.418
Well, I'm fine.

06:34.420 --> 06:38.038
I probably won't be scaling
Everest anytime soon.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.166
Look, I get it.

06:39.170 --> 06:42.913
Sometimes you act first
and think later.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.377
A few months ago, I found you
passed out on the dock.

06:45.380 --> 06:48.201
Maybe you partied too much.

06:48.210 --> 06:49.325
Then one of your friends
gets in a brawl,

06:49.330 --> 06:50.820
and I gotta patch him up?

06:50.830 --> 06:52.206
I mean, it just seems to me

06:52.210 --> 06:53.996
like things are a bit
out of control right now.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.070
Yeah, you could say that.
[clears throat]

06:57.750 --> 07:00.116
You know your mom's
gonna ask me what happened.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.827
Well, tell her the truth.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.286
I slipped.

07:12.250 --> 07:13.990
[Xander]
This is my fault.

07:26.170 --> 07:27.706
In the ocean,

07:28.790 --> 07:30.280
we move forward.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.286
Always.

07:40.620 --> 07:42.372
That shoulder's gonna hurt
like hell in the morning,

07:42.380 --> 07:44.666
but I'm not inclined_
to write you a prescription.

07:44.670 --> 07:46.035
I'm fine.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.247
I, uh... I don't need it.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.115
Look, Ben, I don't want
to jump to conclusions,

07:50.120 --> 07:53.999
but if you feel like
you need it, there's a...

07:54.000 --> 07:56.912
pretty decent meeting
over in Ramapo.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.990
Okay? It's a support group,
it's anonymous.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.207
Glad you're not jumping
to conclusions.

08:01.210 --> 08:02.279
Thanks, Doc.

08:08.290 --> 08:09.279
Hey, Wanda.

08:09.290 --> 08:11.076
Hey, Dale.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.069
Tempura?

08:12.080 --> 08:13.741
I'm good.

08:13.750 --> 08:15.069
What you got?

08:15.080 --> 08:16.160
Mm. Car wreck.

08:16.170 --> 08:17.876
Cell phone in hand.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.576
Cause of death: stupidity.

08:20.580 --> 08:23.492
So what brings you
to Port Angeles?

08:23.500 --> 08:25.456
I'm curious
about that report

08:25.460 --> 08:28.167
on that body that washed up
on Libby Beach?

08:28.170 --> 08:29.876
That military guy,
Aldon Decker.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.667
Mm. There won't be a report.

08:32.670 --> 08:33.705
What do you mean?

08:33.710 --> 08:34.950
Military showed up
this morning

08:34.960 --> 08:36.166
and took possession.

08:36.170 --> 08:37.660
Why didn't you call me?

08:37.670 --> 08:40.070
I didn't think about it.
It was their guy.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.116
Weird that he was here
for two days before they showed,

08:42.120 --> 08:44.577
but that's red tape.

08:44.580 --> 08:47.117
-[Dale] Shit.
-It was pretty clear cut, Dale.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.782
Just like I said, suicide.

08:49.790 --> 08:53.874
Yeah. I was just trying
to clean it up,

08:53.880 --> 08:56.110
let the powers that be
know that it's not on me.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.111
Definitely not on you.

08:59.710 --> 09:01.996
I don't even know
if it was on him.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.115
How's that?

09:04.120 --> 09:05.951
Truth is,
before they got here,

09:05.960 --> 09:07.450
I'd already started
my autopsy.

09:09.420 --> 09:10.660
And?

09:10.670 --> 09:12.820
I found something
a little strange.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.320
[sea lion grunting]

09:23.920 --> 09:25.456
[Jerry humming]

09:25.460 --> 09:27.746
Jer, you feed the lions today?

09:27.750 --> 09:29.411
Uh, no. Iwas waiting
for you. Why?

09:29.420 --> 09:30.535
Wouldn't eat a thing.

09:30.540 --> 09:32.167
Huh. That's weird.

09:32.170 --> 09:34.377
You think
they're getting sick?

09:34.380 --> 09:36.109
No, I checked them out.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.076
Their weight's fine,
body temperature's normal.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.240
Huh. Strange.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.241
Hey, Mads.

09:41.250 --> 09:43.206
Hey.

09:43.210 --> 09:44.029
What are you
doing here?

09:44.040 --> 09:46.452
Just wanted to see you.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.449
Hey, Jerry.

09:47.460 --> 09:49.416
What's up, doc?

09:49.420 --> 09:50.409
Not much.

09:50.420 --> 09:51.785
Uh... where's Ben?

09:51.790 --> 09:53.030
Not here.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.456
[whispering] They're
working opposite shifts.

09:57.460 --> 10:01.078
Jer, weren't
you gonna clean out
the storage space today?

10:02.460 --> 10:03.575
On it.

10:07.420 --> 10:09.115
[sighs]

10:09.120 --> 10:10.451
So, um...

10:12.380 --> 10:14.780
you're mad at me, right?

10:14.790 --> 10:16.826
What do you want me
to say, Xander?

10:18.210 --> 10:19.529
I don't know.

10:19.540 --> 10:22.031
Say that you understand
what happened.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.452
I mean,
how insane all this is.

10:24.460 --> 10:27.167
You want me to tell you
it's okay that you
killed Ryn's sister?

10:28.210 --> 10:29.416
I can't do that.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.412
I know what I did, Maddie.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.200
Believe me.

10:36.210 --> 10:38.246
I know it's crazy, Xander.

10:38.250 --> 10:40.457
I'm still trying
to understand it, too.

10:42.540 --> 10:44.076
They're gone.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.957
You know that, right?

10:45.960 --> 10:47.075
The ones that did it.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.615
Saw your friend
this morning.

10:57.210 --> 10:58.529
Ryn.

10:58.540 --> 11:01.202
Is that what's going on
between you and Ben?

11:01.210 --> 11:03.451
Her?

11:03.460 --> 11:05.496
It's not her fault.

11:05.500 --> 11:06.876
Hey.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.108
You can talk to me.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.917
I know.

11:13.290 --> 11:15.918
Um, I gotta get home
for dinner.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.319
My mom's back.

11:20.540 --> 11:21.746
Really?

11:21.750 --> 11:22.739
Since when?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.035
This morning.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.281
Man, that is so Susan,

11:26.290 --> 11:28.531
just showing up
in the middle
of a shit storm.

11:28.540 --> 11:30.167
She called two days ago.

11:30.170 --> 11:31.819
Next thing I know,
I'm picking her up at the bus.

11:31.830 --> 11:32.876
[Xander]
That was cool of you.

11:32.880 --> 11:34.666
How's she look?

11:34.670 --> 11:36.615
Fine, I guess.

11:36.620 --> 11:37.746
Same.

11:37.750 --> 11:38.876
You think she's clean?

11:40.080 --> 11:42.708
She said she was
on the phone.

11:42.710 --> 11:43.950
You believe her?

11:45.040 --> 11:47.326
No idea.

11:47.330 --> 11:49.958
Remember, uh,
when we were little?

11:49.960 --> 11:52.918
Your dad would go out
looking for her,

11:52.920 --> 11:54.615
drop you off at our place.

11:54.620 --> 11:57.282
Your mom would let us
stay up all night
playing Mario Kart.

11:57.290 --> 11:59.076
Kicked your ass every time,
Princess Peach.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.820
[laughing]

12:07.420 --> 12:09.206
My dad misses her.

12:09.210 --> 12:13.374
[sea lions barking]

12:16.580 --> 12:20.164
[barking continues]

12:29.000 --> 12:30.991
Is that sockeye?

12:31.000 --> 12:34.117
Yeah. Never seen them
move that fast.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.786
[Xander] Holy cow!

12:45.790 --> 12:47.997
[sea lions barking]

12:48.000 --> 12:49.911
Oh!

12:49.920 --> 12:51.205
What's wrong with them?

12:51.210 --> 12:53.166
I don't know. Stay still.

12:53.170 --> 12:55.411
[barking]

13:03.120 --> 13:06.374
[Helen] Customer service
is not high on my list
of priorities,

13:06.380 --> 13:11.784
but I always offer
to help them find
something if they need it.

13:11.790 --> 13:15.419
And then you come here
to ring them up.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.819
[register rings]

13:16.830 --> 13:18.070
Take their money.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.376
This is a quarter.

13:20.380 --> 13:24.077
Four of these
make one dollar.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.990
Good.

13:28.710 --> 13:30.109
Money.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.997
Also known
as "dough" or "moola."

13:32.000 --> 13:33.285
Dough moola.

13:33.290 --> 13:34.700
Oh, man.

13:34.710 --> 13:36.917
Is this lesson
gonna take all day?

13:38.620 --> 13:39.917
[hisses]

13:42.620 --> 13:44.827
That'll be $57.

13:44.830 --> 13:46.707
What? For a mug?

13:46.710 --> 13:48.246
Tourist trap.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.996
Oh!

13:57.000 --> 13:58.069
Hi.

14:01.670 --> 14:02.819
You buy.

14:02.830 --> 14:05.321
Uh...

14:05.330 --> 14:06.456
Thanks, uh...

14:06.460 --> 14:08.030
Not really my color.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.371
[chuckles]

14:10.670 --> 14:12.911
Like Ben and Maddie.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.876
Yes. Very sweet.

14:14.880 --> 14:17.110
[bell jingles]

14:17.120 --> 14:18.109
I miss them.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.576
[door closes]

14:21.000 --> 14:23.787
You were raised
to live in a pack.

14:23.790 --> 14:26.167
_You are
not solitary creatures.

14:32.330 --> 14:35.322
Alone is hard.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.030
What is it, clear?

15:03.290 --> 15:04.996
Something is

15:05.000 --> 15:06.536
happening.

15:06.540 --> 15:08.246
Moving.

15:08.250 --> 15:10.206
[vibrations]

15:10.210 --> 15:12.166
I don't feel anything.

15:18.170 --> 15:19.569
Go now.

15:21.250 --> 15:24.458
[vibrations]

15:24.460 --> 15:26.109
Ryn?

15:26.120 --> 15:27.200
Where are you going?

15:38.880 --> 15:40.529
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.417
[Dale] Hey, Mads.
What took you?

15:42.420 --> 15:43.785
Something
going on at work.

15:43.790 --> 15:45.781
Well, we were
just catching up.

15:45.790 --> 15:47.530
Your mom looks great,
don't you think?

15:47.540 --> 15:49.167
-Yeah.
-Come on, Dale.

15:49.170 --> 15:50.239
It's true.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.741
No, I like
your hair this way.

15:52.750 --> 15:53.614
You know,
when I met your mom,

15:53.620 --> 15:56.248
she had that nine_ties
feather Situation gomg on.

15:56.250 --> 15:57.740
[laughs]
Look who's talking.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.320
I am flashing back
to a mullet.

15:59.330 --> 16:00.877
[both chuckling]

16:00.880 --> 16:02.029
I better
get dinner sorted.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.201
Oh, your mom
already did that.

16:04.210 --> 16:05.871
Wasn't that nice?

16:05.880 --> 16:07.609
Yeah.

16:08.830 --> 16:10.161
Thanks.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.410
Sure.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.576
[sniffs, hisses]

16:28.960 --> 16:30.700
About ready
to pack it in, miss.

16:30.710 --> 16:32.109
What can I get you?

16:32.120 --> 16:34.168
I will buy food.

16:34.170 --> 16:35.706
With money.

16:35.710 --> 16:38.326
Well, good,
'cause that's what I take.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.116
See anything you want?

16:40.120 --> 16:43.704
[vibrations]

16:43.710 --> 16:45.029
-Miss?
-[high-pitched wailing]

16:45.040 --> 16:46.029
You ready?

16:47.460 --> 16:48.529
Miss?

16:51.120 --> 16:54.283
So, uh, what was going
on over at the center?

16:55.540 --> 16:57.531
Uh, little weird, actually.

16:57.540 --> 16:59.167
Something
with the sea lions.

16:59.170 --> 17:01.035
-The center?
-The Marine Research Center.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.280
Maddie's been working there.

17:02.290 --> 17:05.077
Oh. Well, that's nice.
How long?

17:05.080 --> 17:06.570
About nine months.

17:09.580 --> 17:10.569
You always loved animals.

17:12.540 --> 17:14.167
I'm gonna go
use the restroom.

17:14.170 --> 17:15.956
Well, you know where it is.

17:15.960 --> 17:16.995
[Susan] Yep.

17:18.790 --> 17:20.371
She seems
like she's doing well.

17:20.380 --> 17:22.029
We've seen this before.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.530
Come on.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.201
Dad, you've got a lot
going on right now.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.531
Yeah.

17:27.540 --> 17:30.031
Town council
wants to see me tomorrow.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.371
What are you gonna tell them?

17:31.380 --> 17:33.917
Same thing that
I've been saying all along.

17:37.580 --> 17:38.569
[growling]

17:38.580 --> 17:39.615
Fish.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.918
Come on.
You love this stuff!

17:41.920 --> 17:44.411
[barking]

17:47.000 --> 17:49.616
Jer!
What the hell's going on?

17:49.620 --> 17:51.372
I don't know. They've
been coming in all day.

17:51.380 --> 17:53.371
I saw something weird
out there.

17:53.380 --> 17:56.110
A giant school of rockfish
moving like wildﬁre.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.576
Like, hundreds of them.

17:57.580 --> 17:59.616
[phone ringing]

17:59.620 --> 18:00.996
I'll go.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.569
-[ringing]
-You want a fish?

18:06.000 --> 18:09.072
Marine Research.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.707
Slow down.

18:10.710 --> 18:12.826
I can't--
I can't understand you.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.285
Where?

18:16.710 --> 18:17.779
I'll be right there.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.075
What's going on?

18:26.080 --> 18:27.616
I gotta get to town.

18:27.620 --> 18:30.032
There's a situation
at the beach.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.999
Mads, I heard something today
that I think you should know

18:34.000 --> 18:35.456
about Aldon Decker.

18:37.210 --> 18:38.666
Some kind of brain damage

18:38.670 --> 18:39.989
is the way she explained it.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.286
It's not MS, it's not tumors.

18:42.290 --> 18:44.030
It's like something
she's never seen before.

18:45.580 --> 18:47.912
Do you have any idea
what that might mean?

18:49.080 --> 18:51.878
Um... no.

18:51.880 --> 18:52.995
No.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.207
You got new towels.

18:55.210 --> 18:56.825
Oh, Maddie picked them out.

18:56.830 --> 18:59.071
Um, I was thinking
it's probably best

18:59.080 --> 19:01.162
that I stay
at the Siren Song for now.

19:01.170 --> 19:03.877
Give you two a chance
to talk things through.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.029
Bailing already.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.166
[sighs]

19:06.170 --> 19:07.205
Mads.

19:13.380 --> 19:16.281
We would like you to stay

19:16.290 --> 19:18.110
if that's what you want.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.667
Is that okay with you?

19:22.120 --> 19:23.166
Whatever Dad wants.

19:23.170 --> 19:25.377

-[Dale] Excuse me.

19:27.460 --> 19:29.701

-Yeah, what's up, Clarence?
-[cell phone buzzing]

19:31.330 --> 19:33.161
I'm on my way.

19:33.170 --> 19:35.320
-Dad?
-Yep, right behind you.

19:35.330 --> 19:36.786
Wait, what's going on?
Where you guys going?

19:36.790 --> 19:37.870
We gotta go.
I can't explain now.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.029
We'll be back.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.166
Make yourself at home.

Yes.

Hello, Ben.

20:26.250 --> 20:28.161
Hey.

20:28.170 --> 20:29.376
What happened?

20:29.380 --> 20:31.575
-Nothing. I'm fine.
-[siren stops]

20:31.580 --> 20:33.161
What's going on?

20:33.170 --> 20:34.956
Only one alive.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.370
All right,
everybody stand back.

20:36.380 --> 20:37.916
Let this crew in.

-[whale exhales]
-She's breathing.

20:45.790 --> 20:47.166
The mother.

20:47.170 --> 20:49.456
We gotta get her
back in the water!

20:49.460 --> 20:50.495
She will not go

20:50.500 --> 20:52.115
without her baby.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.109
We have to try.

20:56.710 --> 20:58.166
She's
the only one alive.

20:58.170 --> 20:59.239
[man] Thank you.

21:02.210 --> 21:04.201
What drove them
onto the beach?

21:05.210 --> 21:07.030
Something out there.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.996
The sea lions
were gomg crazy today.

21:13.580 --> 21:15.241
Something is wrong.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.958
I must go back in the water.

21:31.420 --> 21:34.457
Ryn, let us send
a camera down instead.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.529
Will you be okay?

21:35.540 --> 21:37.997
Always hard, I think.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.376
But I must go.

21:39.380 --> 21:41.109
We'll be tracking you
the whole time.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.577
If you need us, just signal.

21:43.580 --> 21:45.036
We'll come and find you.

22:19.170 --> 22:20.034
Dale, wait up.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.496
For what, Ted?

22:21.500 --> 22:23.320
Sorry it had to go
this way, okay?

22:23.330 --> 22:25.707
I tried to intervene.
I just want you
to know that.

22:25.710 --> 22:29.248
Did you? Because
I didn't hear you say
a word on my behalf.

22:29.250 --> 22:30.911
Hey, that's not fair, man.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.285
I came to you. I asked you
to give me something

22:32.290 --> 22:33.746
to go back
to these guys with.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.911
What'd you give me?
Nothing.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.070
I would have
liked the benefit
of the doubt, Ted,

22:38.080 --> 22:39.536
like you've gotten from me.

22:39.540 --> 22:41.417
Like your sons have.
Like your wife has.

22:41.420 --> 22:43.285
Come on, really?
We're gonna go there?

22:43.290 --> 22:46.327
You and I have
both had our share
of family issues, Dale.

22:46.330 --> 22:47.911
I'm just saying, Ted,

22:47.920 --> 22:50.662
that I was there for you
when you needed me.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.114
Thanks for returning
the favor.

22:54.670 --> 22:57.036
[Ben] I hope we did
the right thing
letting her go.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.325
[monitor beeping]

23:00.040 --> 23:04.909
Ben, my dad talked
to the ME. about Decker.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.285
And?

23:06.290 --> 23:08.747
She said there was something
going on in his brain.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.741
I mean, obviously.

23:10.750 --> 23:12.377
He drowned himself.

23:13.750 --> 23:16.036
Which, by the way,
I told you that

23:16.040 --> 23:17.166
I wasn't trying to do.

23:17.170 --> 23:19.161
I know, but the song.

23:19.170 --> 23:21.115
There was something
she couldn't explain.

23:21.120 --> 23:22.280
Okay, like what?

23:22.290 --> 23:24.110
Lesions, scarring,
something--

23:24.120 --> 23:25.701
Then maybe he was sick.

23:25.710 --> 23:28.281
But there was no sign
of known disease.

23:28.290 --> 23:30.201
-Maybe the song is--
-Maddie, stop.

23:32.750 --> 23:35.116
This was the problem, right?

23:35.120 --> 23:37.327
I mean,
you can't fix this for me.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.700

24:05.790 --> 24:07.030
[Maddie] What's happening?

24:07.040 --> 24:08.996
There's some kind
of disturbance.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.913
[sound waves pulsing]

24:17.120 --> 24:19.418
She's at 38 degrees,
six miles out.

24:19.420 --> 24:21.115
She's moving in circles.

[engine starts]

24:24.210 --> 24:25.370
Ben, look!

24:36.000 --> 24:36.989
Maddie, hold on.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.109
Where is she?

She's heading to shore!

Ryn, you okay?

25:20.580 --> 25:22.457
You okay?

25:22.460 --> 25:23.950
She's shaking.
I can't stop it.

25:23.960 --> 25:25.029
Ryn?

25:26.080 --> 25:27.320
Can you sit up?

25:28.670 --> 25:29.955
What happened?

25:31.330 --> 25:32.877
Noise.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.108
Loud.

25:35.080 --> 25:36.240
My head.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.038
I saw one, like me.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.071
Dead.

25:44.080 --> 25:46.071
I could not think.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.786
I lost my way.

25:49.790 --> 25:51.530
That's what they're
doing out there.

25:51.540 --> 25:52.700
VVho?

25:52.710 --> 25:54.075
The oil company.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.206
That's how they map
the ocean floor.

25:55.210 --> 25:57.246
With sonic cannons.

25:57.250 --> 25:58.569
Yeah.

25:58.580 --> 26:00.787
They're looking
for a place to drill.

26:04.580 --> 26:05.877
You'll be all right.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.956
[man moaning]

26:09.960 --> 26:11.416
What is that?

26:13.120 --> 26:14.246
Ryn?

26:19.080 --> 26:22.072
[labored breathing]

26:22.080 --> 26:23.991
[breathing stops]

26:30.580 --> 26:32.161
[Ben] Oh, my God.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.532
It's only half transformed.

26:38.540 --> 26:41.031
[pained grunts]

26:44.540 --> 26:47.111
[panﬁng]

26:53.670 --> 26:56.742
[choking breaths]

26:59.210 --> 27:00.575
He's breathing shallow.

27:00.580 --> 27:01.740
Help him, please.

27:08.250 --> 27:09.239
Ben.

27:09.250 --> 27:11.036
[groans] I'm fine.

27:14.460 --> 27:17.076
[music playing]

27:19.120 --> 27:21.702
So sad,
those whales last night.

27:21.710 --> 27:24.031
Why do they do that,
beach themselves?

27:24.040 --> 27:25.325
No one knows,

27:25.330 --> 27:27.537
but it's pretty
nasty stuff, though.

27:27.540 --> 27:29.246
Know what
a beached whale smells like?

27:29.250 --> 27:32.071
Yeah. I, um, been living
with you for three years, man.

27:33.750 --> 27:35.069
What do you, uh,

27:35.080 --> 27:36.411
think's going on out there?

27:38.080 --> 27:39.661
So when I was
with Maddie before,

27:39.670 --> 27:43.322
the sea lions
just started freaking out.

27:43.330 --> 27:45.036
All I know, man,
something's up.

27:45.040 --> 27:48.328
Glad you came in, Xan.

27:48.330 --> 27:50.537
Haven't seen you
for a few days.

27:50.540 --> 27:51.871
We're all cool, right?

27:51.880 --> 27:52.915
Yeah.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.911
I just been busy.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.706
Well, what'll it be?

27:56.710 --> 27:58.450
-Burger, I guess.
-Mm-hmm.

27:58.460 --> 28:00.200
BLT's not bad.

28:00.210 --> 28:01.825
That sounds good.

28:01.830 --> 28:02.990
Uh, make it two.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.993
Course, washing it down
with bourbon helps.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.740
That's my kind of lunch.

28:08.750 --> 28:10.069
Guys, this is...

28:10.080 --> 28:11.069
What'd you say your name was?

28:11.080 --> 28:12.115
Nicole.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.576
Hey.

28:13.580 --> 28:15.207
Haven't seen you
around before.

28:15.210 --> 28:16.416
Just visiting.

28:16.420 --> 28:18.376
Did I hear your friend say
you have a boat?

28:18.380 --> 28:19.369
Yeah.

28:19.380 --> 28:20.824
What kind?

28:20.830 --> 28:21.990
Uh, it's just
a old fishing tub.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.490
Like on Deadliest Catch?

28:24.580 --> 28:27.117
Uh, yeah, kinda.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.417
Love that show.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.285
Such a cool thing to do.

28:31.290 --> 28:32.575
Right?

28:34.380 --> 28:36.701
Mm. He doesn't just own it.

28:36.710 --> 28:38.166
He, uh, lives on it, too.

28:40.040 --> 28:41.109
Really?

28:41.120 --> 28:42.781
Hmm.

28:42.790 --> 28:44.496
Never been
on a fishing boat.

28:50.790 --> 28:52.109
[wheezing]

28:52.120 --> 28:53.166
Pleural effusion--
it's gotta be.

28:53.170 --> 28:54.535
What does it mean?

28:54.540 --> 28:56.201
He has excess fluid

28:56.210 --> 28:57.529
between his chest wall
and lungs.

28:58.790 --> 28:59.916
[gasping]

28:59.920 --> 29:01.956
He needs a local.

29:01.960 --> 29:04.872
Many things can go
wrong when changing.

29:04.880 --> 29:05.995
We learn.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.457
-Like the other one we saw?
-Yes.

29:11.420 --> 29:12.785
You can help him?

29:12.790 --> 29:14.280
I'm gonna try.

29:14.290 --> 29:17.032
[gasping]

29:20.500 --> 29:22.206
Come on, Ben.

29:22.210 --> 29:25.077
Ben, you've seen the vet
do it a hundred times.

29:25.080 --> 29:27.412
What if his lungs aren't
where we think they are?

29:30.170 --> 29:31.489
Come on.

29:40.620 --> 29:41.996
The needle takes
the fluid out.

29:44.170 --> 29:45.706
[deep, clear breath]

29:45.710 --> 29:48.076
[panting breaths]

29:53.080 --> 29:54.069
Sir.

30:05.170 --> 30:06.706
Make sure to log that.

30:06.710 --> 30:07.995
Yes, sir.

30:17.290 --> 30:19.201
You keep Clarence
in line now.

30:19.210 --> 30:21.997
And whatever you do, don't
let him make the coffee.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.241
If you'd just answer
the council's questions,

30:24.250 --> 30:26.616
I'm sure they'd see reason.

30:26.620 --> 30:28.110
Speaking of questions,

30:30.000 --> 30:31.206
Yes, sir.

30:31.210 --> 30:32.996
They wanted to know
about the suspect

30:33.000 --> 30:34.991
you released
in the Donnie Price murder.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.207
Maddie's friend?
And the shooting in town.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.667
You're forgetting about
the wrecked police vehicle.

30:39.670 --> 30:40.989
That, too.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.070
I told them
what you told me,

30:43.080 --> 30:44.160
about the deer.

30:44.170 --> 30:46.070
You did the right thing.

30:50.210 --> 30:51.825
You be careful, Marissa.

30:51.830 --> 30:54.242
If anything unusual
comes up

30:54.250 --> 30:56.161
and you can't handle it,

30:56.170 --> 30:57.376
you call me.

30:59.880 --> 31:00.995
[door closes]

31:01.000 --> 31:02.115
Like what?

31:02.120 --> 31:03.667
You'll know
when it happens.

31:03.670 --> 31:05.956
[engine starts]

31:08.920 --> 31:10.911
Better.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.569
I know why you came.

31:13.880 --> 31:14.869
The noise.

31:17.210 --> 31:18.029
Yes.

31:20.580 --> 31:21.877
More.

31:23.210 --> 31:25.246
Others.

31:25.250 --> 31:26.786
How is he?

31:26.790 --> 31:28.246
Okay.

31:28.250 --> 31:30.036
Where did you go?

31:31.710 --> 31:34.167
We buried the other one.

31:34.170 --> 31:35.068
Someone
might have found it.

31:39.460 --> 31:40.119
What's wrong?

31:53.170 --> 31:54.876
Oh, my God!

32:09.120 --> 32:10.576
[knock on door]

32:15.040 --> 32:16.576
Hey.

32:16.580 --> 32:17.956
[sighs]

32:17.960 --> 32:19.109
[Maddie] Oh, my God.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.667
[Helen]
There's four of them.

32:20.670 --> 32:22.661
Plus the other female
from before.

32:22.670 --> 32:24.376
What are they doing here?

32:24.380 --> 32:26.780
_ There's a disturbance
in the water-- sound waves.

32:26.790 --> 32:28.326
They were forced out.

32:28.330 --> 32:30.457
Where'd you find
this one?

32:30.460 --> 32:31.575
[Ryn]
Hard for him to change.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.116
[Mers gasp]

32:34.210 --> 32:35.370
They leave him.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.410
Hey, what are they doing?

32:40.250 --> 32:42.115
They thought I was dead.

33:03.540 --> 33:04.950
It's bigger than I thought.

33:06.040 --> 33:07.826
[Xander]
Excuse me?

33:07.830 --> 33:08.956
The boat.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.320
Oh, okay. [laughs]

33:11.330 --> 33:12.661
Okay.

33:12.670 --> 33:14.820
Um, what are...

33:14.830 --> 33:16.115
What are you doing here?

33:16.120 --> 33:18.281
Well, when a cute,
relatively sober guy

33:18.290 --> 33:20.497
asks to show me his boat,
it intrigues me.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.206
Oh, well, I have no idea

33:22.210 --> 33:23.416
what makes you think
I was sober.

33:23.420 --> 33:24.660
Well, if you weren't,

33:24.670 --> 33:26.035
you hold your liquor
pretty well.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.996
Well, that is the, uh...

33:28.000 --> 33:30.036
the nicest compliment
I've had all day,
so thank you.

33:32.460 --> 33:33.825
You gonna give me a tour?

33:33.830 --> 33:35.036
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, come on.

33:36.420 --> 33:37.910
Just watch your step.

33:39.250 --> 33:40.956
Okay, I gotcha.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.702
Um, this is the, uh...

33:45.710 --> 33:46.745
the deck.

33:46.750 --> 33:49.071
Thank you, Captain Ahab.

33:49.080 --> 33:50.206
You're very welcome.

33:50.210 --> 33:52.451
And this is
the bridge, right?

33:52.460 --> 33:53.825
Yeah. Good eye.
Real good eye.

33:53.830 --> 33:54.876
Looked it up.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.495
Oh. Clever.
Very clever.

33:56.500 --> 33:59.537
How'd someone so young
get to own his own boat?

33:59.540 --> 34:02.247
Uh, it's...

34:02.250 --> 34:04.912
my dad, he left it to me.

34:06.580 --> 34:09.162
Could use
a little paint maybe.

34:09.170 --> 34:11.912
Yeah, she needs
a lot more than that.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.166
Wow.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.167
He must have
thought a lot of you.

34:21.170 --> 34:22.706
Your dad.

34:25.040 --> 34:26.109
Yeah.

34:30.290 --> 34:31.951
I'm glad you came by.

34:34.170 --> 34:35.159
[hisses]

34:37.920 --> 34:39.535
You.

34:39.540 --> 34:41.201
Help.

34:41.210 --> 34:44.077
_ I see this one is
still as charming as ever.

34:44.080 --> 34:46.071
She was leader.

34:51.210 --> 34:53.280
Now she must ask Ryn

34:55.170 --> 34:56.068
for help.

35:14.580 --> 35:15.820
I help.

35:22.670 --> 35:24.206
[globe rolling]

35:24.210 --> 35:26.576
Ryn, they can't stay here.

35:28.880 --> 35:30.029
I know.

35:35.250 --> 35:36.376
[door rattles]

35:38.710 --> 35:40.450
[glass breaks]

35:40.460 --> 35:42.826
When can they go
back to the water?

35:42.830 --> 35:44.411
We don't know.

35:44.420 --> 35:46.661
I have to find out how much area
they're trying to grid.

35:48.250 --> 35:50.411
Well, what
the hell are we gonna do
with them all tonight?

35:53.210 --> 35:55.075
[soft hiss]

35:59.790 --> 36:01.030
I know a place.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.114
[soft hiss]

36:23.580 --> 36:25.116
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

36:25.120 --> 36:26.610
Best one I got.

36:26.620 --> 36:29.032
Does your dad know
you took his van?

36:29.040 --> 36:30.200
What do you think?

36:30.210 --> 36:32.075
Oh, great.

36:32.080 --> 36:33.786
Grand theft auto.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.780
You help me?

36:50.790 --> 36:52.109
[soft hiss]

37:08.170 --> 37:09.159
[light switch clicking]

37:09.170 --> 37:11.115
What if your parents
decide to show up?

37:11.120 --> 37:12.872
They haven't been here
for ten years,

37:12.880 --> 37:14.450
not since my mom's accident.

37:20.170 --> 37:22.991
Gotta figure out food,
water.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.820
_There's a stream
just down the hill.

37:27.120 --> 37:29.668
Ryn, will more of them
come to land?

37:29.670 --> 37:31.160
I don't know.

37:36.420 --> 37:37.535
I always told you

37:37.540 --> 37:39.997
to not trust Ted.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.116
He would throw
his own mother
under the bus.

37:42.120 --> 37:44.031
Not gonna defend the man.

37:44.040 --> 37:46.326
Does Maddie know
they took your badge?

37:47.830 --> 37:50.162
I haven't seen her yet.

37:50.170 --> 37:53.378
I'm hoping she's patching
things up with Ben.

37:54.790 --> 37:55.825
Ted's son.

37:55.830 --> 37:58.378
Maddie is dating
Ben Pownall?

37:58.380 --> 37:59.665
Was.

37:59.670 --> 38:01.240
They've hit a bump.

38:01.250 --> 38:04.071
[sighs] I'll bet Elaine's
eating that up.

38:06.040 --> 38:07.109
Maddie didn't tell me.

38:09.290 --> 38:10.450
I don't blame her.

38:10.460 --> 38:13.281
Gotta give her some time.

38:13.290 --> 38:16.111
We both know she needs
more than just time.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.497
Did you find what you
were looking for
in the closet?

38:20.500 --> 38:23.116
Yeah.
My favorite slippers.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.451
[chuckles]

38:26.750 --> 38:29.321
You kept everything
just the way it was

38:29.330 --> 38:30.957
for ten months.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.207
Well, ten months isn't
very long in a lifetime.

39:03.460 --> 39:04.996
[buzzing]

39:26.210 --> 39:28.371
Lieutenant Martinez
reporting.

39:28.380 --> 39:30.166
I've followed the trail,
gained access,

39:30.170 --> 39:32.377
secured the location.

39:32.380 --> 39:34.917
I'll be in touch.

39:34.920 --> 39:35.955
[beep]

39:35.960 --> 39:37.746
[Ryn] You can go.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.706
I will take care
of them.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.325
Ryn, we're not leaving
you here alone.

39:41.330 --> 39:43.207
[Helen]
It's all right.

39:43.210 --> 39:44.996
I'll stay.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.206
They're my people, too.

39:49.170 --> 39:50.614
You sure about this?

39:50.620 --> 39:52.201
We'll be fine.

39:52.210 --> 39:53.529
You two go back,

39:53.540 --> 39:55.576
bring supplies
in the morning.

39:55.580 --> 39:58.322
[female singer]
Shallow breath

39:58.330 --> 40:01.993
Her desire for the deep

40:02.000 --> 40:04.116
Wasn't made for this

40:04.120 --> 40:07.283
All the secrets that I keep

40:07.290 --> 40:10.327
Like a bomb inside of me

40:10.330 --> 40:14.039
I've been waiting
to be free

40:14.040 --> 40:17.328
If you pull me down

40:17.330 --> 40:19.321
You're goin' down with me

40:19.330 --> 40:22.322
- You're goin' down with me
-[engine starts]

40:22.330 --> 40:26.699
You're goin' down with me

40:26.710 --> 40:29.747
If you pull me dow-ow-own

40:29.750 --> 40:32.787
You're goin' down with me

40:32.790 --> 40:35.953
You're goin' down
with me

40:35.960 --> 40:39.077
If you pull me dow-ow-own

40:39.080 --> 40:41.207
You're goin' down with me

40:41.210 --> 40:43.201
[whispering]
You must be tired.

40:43.210 --> 40:46.373
Why don't you go in there
and lie down?

40:46.380 --> 40:47.574
I stay.

40:51.790 --> 40:55.078
Oh. Poor thing.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.207
She seems lost.

40:57.210 --> 41:00.111
Sister's...

41:01.120 --> 41:02.166
baby.

41:06.380 --> 41:08.371
She's Donna's daughter?

41:08.380 --> 41:11.201
You're goin' down with me

41:11.210 --> 41:14.282
If you pull me dow-ow-own

41:14.290 --> 41:17.999
You're goin' down with me

41:18.000 --> 41:20.241
You're goin' down
with me

41:20.250 --> 41:23.879
You're goin' down with me

41:23.880 --> 41:27.202
If you pull me dow-ow-own

41:27.210 --> 41:29.496
You're goin' down with me

41:31.500 --> 41:33.912
[placid high-pitched call]

41:37.790 --> 41:40.418
[music playing]
