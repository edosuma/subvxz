WEBVTT

00:49.120 --> 00:50.554
Tie it off, come on!

01:14.560 --> 01:17.200
Hey, guys! Guys,
I think we should turn back.

01:17.360 --> 01:19.477
And lose good money?
Not a chance.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.194
Stay close.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.269
Here we are.

01:31.680 --> 01:32.909
Get on his back.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.640
Hurry up.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.600
Whoa!

01:59.680 --> 02:01.194
Ow!

02:02.160 --> 02:03.230
Whoa!

02:06.080 --> 02:07.594
There he is.
Go get him.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.193
Oh, you'll pay for that.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.512
No. No, please.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.592
Please, no.

03:33.320 --> 03:34.720
Hold it there.

03:52.760 --> 03:53.830
I only got one...

03:54.040 --> 03:55.872
but he's a fine specimen.

04:03.080 --> 04:04.400
- That's all?
- Yeah.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.994
That shroom bit me twice.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.475
Huh.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.879
Tomb Bloom.

04:38.160 --> 04:39.674
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

04:39.880 --> 04:42.111
<i>or perhaps twice upon a time,</i>

04:42.200 --> 04:43.953
<i>for you may
remember this story...</i>

04:44.120 --> 04:48.478
<i>there was a powerful Fey
named Maleficent.</i>

04:57.640 --> 04:59.916
<i>For some reason,
the mistress of evil</i>

05:00.000 --> 05:01.434
<i>and protector of the Moors...</i>

05:01.600 --> 05:04.593
<i>was still hated
after all this time.</i>

05:04.800 --> 05:07.599
<i>True, she had cursed
the princess, Aurora...</i>

05:07.760 --> 05:09.797
<i>but that was before
she found light</i>

05:09.880 --> 05:11.599
<i>in the heart
of a human child...</i>

05:11.760 --> 05:14.514
<i>and raised the girl
as her own.</i>

05:14.680 --> 05:17.434
<i>After all,
it was Maleficent's love</i>

05:17.520 --> 05:20.433
<i>which broke
that very same curse.</i>

05:20.600 --> 05:24.799
<i>But that detail was somehow
mysteriously forgotten.</i>

05:24.960 --> 05:26.997
<i>For as the tale was told</i>

05:27.080 --> 05:30.312
<i>over and again
throughout the kingdom...</i>

05:30.480 --> 05:34.520
<i>Maleficent became the villain
once more.</i>

05:46.960 --> 05:49.236
It's time, guys.
Come on. Let's get everyone.

05:49.320 --> 05:50.376
It's the big day!

05:50.400 --> 05:51.616
- Come on.
- Let's go!

05:51.640 --> 05:53.233
Wake up. Wake up.

05:54.720 --> 05:55.790
Come on.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.994
Hurry up, wallerbogs!
It's time!

06:24.800 --> 06:26.519
Do you both remember
the secret plan?

06:26.680 --> 06:28.319
I've got it all right here.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.880
When do I tell the queen
the secret?

06:30.040 --> 06:31.633
You must be patient,
Thistlewit.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.473
Do you think Queen Aurora's
awake yet?

06:33.640 --> 06:36.792
Well, she's not
"Sleeping Beauty" anymore.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.236
I see what you did there.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.479
Next item of business,
the missing fairies.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.275
I've sent more sprites

06:56.360 --> 06:58.317
to search
the Tomb Bloom field.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.040
They'll report back to me
at nightfall.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.311
We will keep searching
until we find them.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.474
Please don't raise
your roots at me, Lief.

07:07.640 --> 07:10.792
Crushing humans with branches
is not going to help.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.070
Diaval, you're supposed to be
on my side.

07:17.320 --> 07:20.950
Well, I'm Queen of the Moors,
and I am a human.

07:23.640 --> 07:26.474
We must all learn
a little kindness.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.240
Coming through.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.760
Excuse us.

07:29.920 --> 07:30.956
Official pixie business.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.320
A word, Your Majesty.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.800
- Maybe two.
- Aunties...

07:33.960 --> 07:36.077
you need to wait your turn
like everyone else.

07:36.240 --> 07:38.120
- No!
- This can't wait, Your Grace.

07:38.280 --> 07:39.555
Not for a moment.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.110
Or I might burst.
Truly, I might.

07:42.960 --> 07:43.960
Is that...?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.320
Pinto!

07:48.480 --> 07:49.914
She's come bearing gifts.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.993
The first sap
from the warming trees.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.032
It's for the big day!

07:55.160 --> 07:56.276
Quiet, Thistlewit.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.954
What big day?

08:00.360 --> 08:02.113
Hey! My crown!

08:07.600 --> 08:09.398
I'm not in the mood for this.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.150
Pinto!

08:12.640 --> 08:13.994
Whoa!

08:22.600 --> 08:23.600
Come on.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.077
Where are you going, aunties?

08:28.640 --> 08:29.640
Whoa!

08:29.720 --> 08:31.757
I don't have time
for games, Pinto.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.673
What's gotten into all of you?

08:53.240 --> 08:55.277
Oh. Uh-oh!

08:59.400 --> 09:00.959
There she goes, Your Majesty.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.879
Come back here.

09:12.040 --> 09:15.431
Pinto. I've had enough
of your games for today.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.394
Look at me.

09:23.760 --> 09:24.876
Oh.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.753
Philip.
What are you doing here?

09:26.960 --> 09:28.189
I was looking for you.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.318
- Oh, well, hello.
- Hello.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.597
I'm really sorry,
I can't talk right now.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.154
The Moors have turned
to madness.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.680
I've got a castle
full of complaints.

09:35.720 --> 09:36.960
- I know how busy you are.
- Oh!

09:37.760 --> 09:39.035
I wanted to ask you something.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.120
Yes.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.634
Do you think there
could be a union

09:41.720 --> 09:43.279
between Ulstead and the Moors?

09:44.280 --> 09:45.680
A union?

09:46.040 --> 09:47.599
To connect both lands.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.877
To bring harmony and peace.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.072
I've been imagining a bridge.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.994
Oh, a bridge.

09:54.760 --> 09:55.830
Yes, a bridge.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.231
A union's a wonderful idea...

09:58.400 --> 10:00.278
if both sides are willing.

10:01.520 --> 10:04.274
Well, I'm working
on that part.

10:04.440 --> 10:05.840
He's going to blow it.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.240
Give him time.
He's warming up.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.235
Wait.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.592
That's your formal coat.

10:16.760 --> 10:18.513
You're in on all of this,
aren't you?

10:19.440 --> 10:21.016
If you're busy,
I could always come back.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.759
No. No, no.

10:22.920 --> 10:24.115
I'm not busy at all.

10:24.280 --> 10:25.600
No, because I'd hate to...

10:25.760 --> 10:27.114
Really. All ears.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.440
What did you
want to talk about?

10:29.960 --> 10:31.599
You're right.
He's blowing it.

10:33.320 --> 10:35.437
Five years ago,
I thought I lost you forever.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.715
I've decided to reclaim
this day for us.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.360
I've loved you
since the moment I met you

10:42.400 --> 10:43.400
and every day since.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.152
If love has a truth,
here is mine.

10:47.320 --> 10:48.640
There is no magic nor curse

10:48.720 --> 10:51.030
that could ever tear me away
from you, Aurora.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.336
Are you sure
this is a good time?

10:56.360 --> 10:57.510
Oh, Philip.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.040
Oh, he's on his knee.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.520
He took his sweet time
about it.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.354
Will you marry me?

11:07.440 --> 11:08.590
Yes.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.314
- Yes?
- Yes.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.672
Yes! Yes, just stand up.
Kiss me.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.552
We're having a wedding!

11:27.640 --> 11:30.314
A secret surprise wedding.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.831
Of course,
we have to tell our parents.

11:38.600 --> 11:39.920
Do we?

12:10.080 --> 12:11.080
Mistress.

12:11.560 --> 12:12.560
What?

12:13.120 --> 12:14.839
I have a little bit of news.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.153
Well, on with it.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.958
It's nothing
of any real consequence...

12:20.120 --> 12:23.796
and it's certainly
no reason to overreact.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.759
It's just that...

12:26.760 --> 12:28.353
Prince Philip has, um...

12:29.040 --> 12:30.190
Disappeared?

12:30.560 --> 12:33.359
No.
No. Philip has...

12:33.560 --> 12:34.960
Yellow fever? No, wait!

12:36.160 --> 12:37.560
Leprosy!

12:37.800 --> 12:39.359
No, Mistress.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.954
Prince Philip has asked Aurora
if she'll become his...

12:43.120 --> 12:44.793
Don't...

12:45.440 --> 12:47.909
ruin my morning.

12:50.560 --> 12:51.789
Mistress, please.

12:55.560 --> 12:56.710
Stay calm!

13:04.440 --> 13:05.640
<i>So, tell me, sire...</i>

13:05.720 --> 13:07.040
am I to be a best man,

13:07.120 --> 13:09.077
or did you choose a creature
from the Moors?

13:09.240 --> 13:10.320
General, if that's your way

13:10.360 --> 13:12.750
of asking me
if she said yes, then I, uh...

13:12.920 --> 13:14.832
I know she said yes, sire.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.515
What human wouldn't want
to leave that place?

13:17.680 --> 13:19.416
What do you have against
Moor folk, Percival?

13:19.440 --> 13:21.671
"Moor folk"? Is that what
we're calling them now?

13:22.200 --> 13:24.032
Winged beasts,
murderous trees.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.879
Guard your tongue, General.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.269
You know nothing about them.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.238
I know that Maleficent
is a killer of men...

13:29.400 --> 13:32.871
destroyer of armies.
Or so the story goes.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.599
She's not like that.

13:35.760 --> 13:38.116
It's my job to protect
this kingdom.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.873
And I will do so,
old friend...

13:40.560 --> 13:42.358
without hesitation.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.993
Walk on.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.238
Open the gates!

14:00.880 --> 14:02.872
Your Majesty,
spoils from the annexation

14:02.960 --> 14:04.394
of the Midlands have arrived.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.280
Weapons.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.357
No. We have no need of arms.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.192
Our days of war are over.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.033
Ingrith...

14:18.640 --> 14:20.791
you see where
I've had you placed.

14:20.920 --> 14:21.920
Right behind me.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.596
And that's
where I'll always be.

14:26.160 --> 14:29.073
Ingrith, I said
we had no need of arms.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.910
One can never be too careful.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.791
Your Majesty, it's cocked.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.872
Is it, now?

14:47.160 --> 14:48.992
- Father, Mother.
- Well?

14:49.200 --> 14:50.270
What did she say?

14:50.920 --> 14:51.920
She said yes.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.839
Yes!

14:53.960 --> 14:56.714
That is wonderful news. Oh!

14:56.920 --> 14:59.560
Two kingdoms united at last.

14:59.640 --> 15:00.640
Yes.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.310
Yes.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.072
Perhaps I've been selfish...

15:08.240 --> 15:10.516
looking at this the wrong way.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.749
You've made your choice.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.554
Now is a time to celebrate.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.312
I'm glad you finally approve.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.816
Much more than that.

15:23.840 --> 15:27.959
I am ready to welcome
your fiancée with open arms.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.376
She shall come to dinner.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.436
That would be incredible.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.193
Under one condition.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.714
She will bring her godmother.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.440
Your Majesty, I strongly...

15:37.560 --> 15:39.711
We will meet the one
who raised her

15:39.800 --> 15:41.359
right here in this castle.

15:41.520 --> 15:42.880
Yes.
The queen is right.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.096
I'm not sure
her godmother will...

15:44.120 --> 15:45.713
No, but I insist.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.994
After all,
we will soon be family.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.516
Well, let it be known
throughout the kingdom...

15:52.720 --> 15:56.236
that my son
is to marry Aurora.

15:57.720 --> 16:00.189
And Maleficent
is coming to dinner.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.509
I shall
send word straightaway.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.200
Oh!

16:26.880 --> 16:27.880
Incoming.

16:30.760 --> 16:33.400
Hold on to your petticoats!

16:44.720 --> 16:46.552
Well, well.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.549
So?

16:51.320 --> 16:52.720
So.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.480
Godmother...

17:01.480 --> 17:03.437
Philip asked me to marry him.

17:04.800 --> 17:05.950
Poor thing.

17:06.119 --> 17:07.759
He'll recover.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.836
My answer was yes.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.877
- No.
- Yes.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.040
No.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.349
I wasn't really asking.

17:19.520 --> 17:20.636
Nor was I.

17:21.319 --> 17:22.674
What's next?

17:22.839 --> 17:24.512
You'll turn him into a goat?

17:25.640 --> 17:26.640
Hmm.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.233
Stop.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.917
Why don't you like Philip?

17:31.080 --> 17:32.912
Well, for one thing,
he's human.

17:33.080 --> 17:34.514
I'm a human.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.559
And I have never
held that against you.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.880
Until I fell in love.

17:40.040 --> 17:44.193
Love doesn't always
end well, Beasty.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.830
I'll have you know
Prince Philip is a prince.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.635
A very handsome
and charming prince.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.240
I'm just asking you
to trust me.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.512
Please give him a chance.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.353
Let us prove you wrong.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.432
Philip is thoughtful...

18:03.640 --> 18:04.994
he's very kind...

18:05.200 --> 18:06.475
Kind of what?

18:07.360 --> 18:09.431
The king and queen
are celebrating tonight...

18:09.600 --> 18:12.035
and they have invited
both of us to the castle.

18:12.760 --> 18:17.391
You want me
to meet his parents?

18:17.920 --> 18:19.036
It's just a dinner.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.915
They don't want me in Ulstead.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.873
Why on earth would I go?

18:25.360 --> 18:28.159
Because his mother
wishes to meet mine.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.160
Please.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.799
Philip.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.034
I want you
to wear this tonight.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.676
Your sword?

18:45.840 --> 18:46.910
Because of you,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.469
Ulstead and the Moors
will be united at last.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.554
Father, my love for Aurora

18:54.640 --> 18:56.154
has nothing to do
with politics.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.591
Yes, but your love...

18:58.760 --> 19:02.515
will ensure peace
for generations.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.990
Now take it. And wear it...

19:05.200 --> 19:08.159
to know that
you will never have to use it.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.279
Oh, my son.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.111
I've never been more proud.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.159
And what about Mother?

19:19.320 --> 19:21.437
Is she okay with this?

19:22.320 --> 19:26.439
Your mother will learn
to love who you love.

20:20.640 --> 20:21.640
Oh.

20:22.600 --> 20:25.752
Tomb Bloom. Tomb Bloom.

20:38.160 --> 20:39.355
Oh.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.198
I'm losing my patience.

20:44.840 --> 20:45.956
Your Majesty.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.875
You need to move faster,
Lickspittle.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.076
Yes, Your Majesty.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.033
Aurora said yes.

20:58.480 --> 21:01.200
It's all coming together...

21:03.000 --> 21:04.912
perfectly.

21:14.280 --> 21:15.760
Hello.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.479
Hello.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.073
Hello.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.997
Try it with
a little less fang.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.114
How's this?

21:32.640 --> 21:33.790
Try the greeting.

21:35.160 --> 21:38.278
How kind of you
to invite me this evening.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.358
Remember, it's not a threat.

21:41.320 --> 21:45.314
So very kind of you
to invite me this evening.

21:46.200 --> 21:49.238
- Yeah. Better.
- Oh.

21:49.320 --> 21:50.320
Try it with a curtsy.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.233
We can skip that part.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.077
She really loves that boy,
you know.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.757
You're doing her
a great kindness.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.399
Kindness?

22:09.520 --> 22:10.520
Mistress...

22:24.440 --> 22:26.159
Doesn't she look lovely?

22:30.680 --> 22:32.239
I have something for you.

22:32.440 --> 22:33.440
Hmm?

22:35.680 --> 22:37.160
For your horns.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.474
I just thought it might make

22:39.560 --> 22:41.358
Philip's family
feel more comfortable.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.080
And you, as well.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.589
Maybe it's a bad idea.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.474
No, it's...

22:52.360 --> 22:53.476
It's all right.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.672
I'm so excited.

23:04.760 --> 23:07.719
Mmm...
It's more than I can bear.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.520
It's Maleficent!

23:52.360 --> 23:53.874
Pitchforks?

23:54.040 --> 23:56.396
- Humans are hilarious.
- Mmm-hmm.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.600
- It's getting better.
- Hmm.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.191
Anyone leaves
their post gets hung.

24:20.280 --> 24:21.350
Yes, sir.

24:31.320 --> 24:32.993
They're here.

24:40.160 --> 24:42.356
Have you ever considered
turning me into a bear?

24:42.520 --> 24:44.716
I think I'd make
quite an impressive one.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.336
Look at their claws.
They're so strong.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.113
Why are we
talking about bears?

24:49.640 --> 24:51.677
Presenting Queen Aurora
of the Moors.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.034
Thank you.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.119
You look wonderful.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.833
I'm so happy
to be here.

25:09.680 --> 25:12.320
Aurora, this is
truly an honor.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.231
Welcome to Ulstead.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.240
Such a beautiful girl.

25:22.920 --> 25:25.389
I can see how you stole
Philip's heart.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.873
Your Majesty.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.551
The flowers in your hair.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.040
I'm allergic.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.595
I'm so sorry.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.951
Oh, no. No, no.
It's all right.

25:39.040 --> 25:40.110
They're beautiful.

25:40.280 --> 25:41.430
Presenting Maleficent.

25:52.960 --> 25:55.759
Maleficent, it's wonderful
to see you again.

25:57.600 --> 26:00.240
This is my father,
King John of Ulstead.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.278
And my mother, Queen Ingrith.

26:03.080 --> 26:05.754
Welcome to our home.

26:09.280 --> 26:13.274
It's so very kind of you
to invite me this evening.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.070
Don't smile.

26:17.400 --> 26:20.359
And, um, I would like
to introduce you to Diaval.

26:21.640 --> 26:25.156
I trust you had no trouble
finding the castle.

26:25.320 --> 26:26.993
Why would I have trouble?

26:28.920 --> 26:29.920
Shoo!

26:30.680 --> 26:32.911
He's making small talk.

26:33.240 --> 26:35.277
I'll explain it later.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.274
No trouble at all.

26:37.440 --> 26:39.432
Your Majesties,
ladies and gentlemen,

26:39.520 --> 26:40.636
dinner is served.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.318
Please, make yourselves
at home.

27:01.880 --> 27:02.880
Hmm.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.629
Bird.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.279
Delicious.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.399
Is there a problem?

27:30.600 --> 27:31.670
It's iron.

27:32.080 --> 27:34.515
Majesty, as you are
sensitive to flowers,

27:34.600 --> 27:36.000
she is averse to iron.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.354
I had no idea.

27:39.520 --> 27:41.989
Take it away at once.

27:47.880 --> 27:50.190
I trust you'll be comfortable
using your hands?

27:52.080 --> 27:54.515
Such a warm
spell of weather, isn't it?

27:54.760 --> 27:56.114
It certainly is.

27:58.760 --> 27:59.760
Shoo!

27:59.840 --> 28:03.629
Well, we have a small gift
for Philip and Aurora...

28:03.800 --> 28:08.158
to celebrate their
glorious future together. Hmm?

28:17.280 --> 28:18.760
Oh, I simply can't wait

28:18.840 --> 28:20.960
to have a little one running
through the castle again.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.760
This castle?

28:26.920 --> 28:28.274
Yes, of course.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.633
This will be their home.

28:33.080 --> 28:36.676
I hear Aurora has
a castle of her own.

28:37.720 --> 28:39.518
Yes, sir, I do.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.034
Yes...

28:42.280 --> 28:46.832
I'm curious. How did Aurora
become Queen of the Moors?

28:47.040 --> 28:48.896
- I made her queen.
- Her castle is

28:48.920 --> 28:50.274
quite stunning.
You must see it.

28:50.440 --> 28:53.353
Yes, but in fact,
she has another castle.

28:54.760 --> 28:55.989
Does she not?

28:57.400 --> 28:58.400
Mother...

28:58.480 --> 28:59.516
One in the Moors,

28:59.600 --> 29:02.399
and one left behind
by her father.

29:02.560 --> 29:05.553
King Stefan, was it not?

29:06.320 --> 29:09.438
That castle was never my home.
It was given to the people.

29:10.600 --> 29:13.240
So, you're also
a true princess.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.517
Even though Stefan died.
Was killed?

29:15.680 --> 29:17.478
Remind me,
did he die or was he killed?

29:18.480 --> 29:20.597
Both.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.551
Yes, you're right,
it is very warm recently.

29:24.720 --> 29:28.555
Because I remember
the story of a baby.

29:28.720 --> 29:31.758
A baby cursed to sleep...

29:32.720 --> 29:34.040
and never wake up.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.594
Really?

29:36.760 --> 29:38.194
Who would do
such a terrible thing

29:38.280 --> 29:40.351
to an innocent child?

29:42.360 --> 29:46.718
Well, there are many who prey
on the innocent.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.951
I'm sure
your kind would agree.

29:49.480 --> 29:50.800
What do you mean, my kind?

29:51.200 --> 29:53.396
She means humans.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.398
There are fairies missing
from the Moors.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.114
What I'm missing is some wine.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.999
Stolen by human poachers.

29:59.160 --> 30:00.480
That's the first
I've heard of it.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.960
Someone gave the order.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.996
It sounds as if
you're accusing the king.

30:13.320 --> 30:14.549
No, she never said that.

30:14.720 --> 30:17.155
Wait... Sorry,
who would steal a fairy?

30:17.320 --> 30:18.470
Your Majesty, I must report

30:18.560 --> 30:19.856
that two peasants
were found dead...

30:19.880 --> 30:21.633
just outside the Moors.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.479
They'd been missing
for several days.

30:23.640 --> 30:24.640
I see.

30:25.320 --> 30:27.516
Yes, we all see.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.114
The borders are open,

30:29.200 --> 30:30.896
but humans are not welcome.
Isn't that right?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.595
What exactly are you implying,
Your Majesty?

30:34.760 --> 30:37.878
Innocent men are being
slaughtered on the Moors...

30:38.320 --> 30:40.039
and she's talking
about fairies.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.397
Contain your animal.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.358
Or I will.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.270
If I didn't know better,

30:54.360 --> 30:55.640
I'd say you were
making a threat.

30:55.760 --> 30:56.796
Well, do you?

30:57.000 --> 30:58.957
- Do I what?
- Know better?

30:59.120 --> 31:00.120
Enough.

31:00.280 --> 31:01.509
Put her down.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.957
Please, put her down.

31:07.240 --> 31:10.074
We're here to celebrate.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.151
Forgive me, he's right.

31:15.320 --> 31:17.277
Let's not forget
why we're here.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.353
The start of a new life
for Aurora.

31:22.440 --> 31:23.920
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

31:28.040 --> 31:29.040
You have done

31:29.120 --> 31:31.680
an admirable job,
Maleficent...

31:31.840 --> 31:35.880
going against your own nature
to raise this child.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.353
But now...

31:38.520 --> 31:41.957
Aurora will finally get...

31:42.120 --> 31:44.430
the love of a real family.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.640
A real mother.

31:46.840 --> 31:50.117
Because the one thing
I regret...

31:50.280 --> 31:52.954
is never having a daughter
of my own.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.954
But tonight changes that.

31:56.120 --> 32:01.559
Tonight,
I consider Aurora my own.

32:15.920 --> 32:16.956
Guards!

32:17.160 --> 32:19.197
We have opened our home
to a witch!

32:29.800 --> 32:30.836
Stop!

32:31.920 --> 32:33.274
There is no union.

32:33.440 --> 32:34.920
There will be no wedding.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.754
- Maleficent!
- We must protect the king!

32:37.920 --> 32:39.559
Maleficent, please, stop now.

32:39.720 --> 32:42.030
John, I'm so frightened.

32:42.520 --> 32:43.556
Ah!

32:43.640 --> 32:45.677
What has she done to me?

32:47.120 --> 32:48.120
Father!

32:50.160 --> 32:51.160
John!

32:51.840 --> 32:53.069
We go home.

32:54.920 --> 32:55.920
John!

32:57.160 --> 32:58.160
It's a curse.

33:00.720 --> 33:02.040
It's a curse!

33:02.480 --> 33:04.392
Maleficent has cursed
the king!

33:07.200 --> 33:08.270
What have you done?

33:08.440 --> 33:10.238
I've done nothing.

33:11.080 --> 33:13.515
Aurora, we go home now.

33:15.600 --> 33:16.636
Aurora!

33:30.480 --> 33:31.550
Aurora!

33:31.840 --> 33:33.274
Wake him!

33:35.520 --> 33:37.318
Wake him, please.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.034
Stand aside!

35:04.360 --> 35:05.589
To the bedroom!

35:07.520 --> 35:09.989
This magic, we have
no tools to reverse it.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.677
There must be a lesion.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.109
Proof of her witchery.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.431
Please,
leave His Majesty his dignity.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.560
We all saw
what Maleficent did to him.

35:22.240 --> 35:23.913
I'm so sorry.

35:24.080 --> 35:27.517
A curse upon our king
is a curse upon this kingdom.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.635
All he wanted was peace.

35:32.080 --> 35:33.639
This is all my fault.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.556
You have nothing
to apologize for, my dear.

35:37.760 --> 35:41.071
Maleficent is a threat
to everyone.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.352
Especially you.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.796
We'll do our best
to protect you.

35:47.920 --> 35:50.071
There must be a way
to reverse this.

35:51.840 --> 35:54.230
Mother,
could you try kissing him?

35:56.280 --> 35:58.317
True love and all that.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.353
I doubt that would work.

36:04.520 --> 36:05.795
It could save him.

36:05.960 --> 36:08.600
- A kiss is just a kiss.
- Please, Mother.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.353
Very well.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.997
You wanted peace...

36:23.520 --> 36:26.513
now rest in peace forever.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.352
I told you.

36:37.520 --> 36:40.479
This is no fairy tale.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.197
I have to return to the Moors.

36:43.360 --> 36:44.396
It's the only way.

36:44.560 --> 36:45.789
Wait, wait. Come here.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.394
I have to find her.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.736
It's the middle of the night.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.400
She will break the curse.
I know she will.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.193
Okay, well,
let me come with you.

36:52.680 --> 36:54.797
No. You should stay
with your family.

36:54.960 --> 36:56.280
You are my family.

36:58.360 --> 37:00.317
Let her go, Philip.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.756
Maybe she can save him.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.359
Maleficent!

38:03.960 --> 38:05.633
Maleficent!

38:13.160 --> 38:14.879
Godmother!

38:21.760 --> 38:24.036
Please come back.

38:28.320 --> 38:29.520
She's not in the Moors.

38:30.760 --> 38:31.760
Diaval.

38:33.400 --> 38:34.914
No one's seen her.

38:35.160 --> 38:36.753
I'm so happy to see you.

38:38.600 --> 38:39.954
She's nowhere to be found.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.153
What if she never comes back?

38:43.320 --> 38:45.471
I could be stuck
as a human forever.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.279
I have to find her.

38:50.360 --> 38:53.114
She's the only one
who can break the curse.

39:53.200 --> 39:54.554
Tell me she's dead.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.876
The iron pierced her flesh.

39:58.080 --> 40:00.640
She fell into the river
and went over the falls.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.914
Then where is her head?

40:05.400 --> 40:07.357
There was something else.

40:07.720 --> 40:09.552
Another creature.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.879
It pulled her
from the depths of the sea.

40:13.440 --> 40:15.079
What did it look like?

40:15.680 --> 40:16.680
Her.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.471
It carried her
up into the sky.

40:20.560 --> 40:23.029
Hmm. A wounded animal
lashes out

40:23.120 --> 40:24.315
and now she's not alone.

40:24.520 --> 40:27.115
We must be ready for war.

40:30.240 --> 40:31.913
Maleficent has
cursed the king!

40:38.680 --> 40:39.680
Stay inside!

40:47.040 --> 40:48.600
Maleficent has
cursed the king!

42:21.640 --> 42:25.395
If Conall hadn't
found her, she would be dead.

42:29.320 --> 42:31.073
They tried to kill her
with this.

42:47.880 --> 42:49.837
Do you hear it?

42:51.200 --> 42:52.236
Do you hear it?

42:54.040 --> 42:55.040
Huh?

42:56.120 --> 42:57.713
It's a message
from the humans.

42:59.240 --> 43:00.993
I hear it loud and clear.

43:01.680 --> 43:03.956
Time for us to die.

43:05.080 --> 43:08.676
Humans have used iron
against us for centuries.

43:08.840 --> 43:11.196
And we are almost extinct
because of it.

43:11.400 --> 43:12.914
Killing peasants
on the Moors

43:13.000 --> 43:15.071
will only lead
to more conflict, Borra.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.360
They've pulled the iron
from the earth...

43:17.440 --> 43:20.080
made their swords and shields,
drove us underground.

43:20.280 --> 43:21.600
But this...

43:24.880 --> 43:26.030
This will finish us.

43:26.200 --> 43:27.800
Our people are safe
here for now.

43:28.200 --> 43:29.634
But for how long?

43:29.800 --> 43:31.678
The humans will find us.
They will not stop.

43:32.480 --> 43:34.472
I call for war.

43:36.120 --> 43:37.634
I call for war!

43:37.840 --> 43:38.876
Right now!

43:40.280 --> 43:42.192
There are
too many humans.

43:44.800 --> 43:45.800
Too many kingdoms.

43:45.960 --> 43:48.031
Conall,
they will keep finding

43:48.120 --> 43:49.873
new ways to destroy us.

43:50.040 --> 43:51.633
We can't win.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.951
We can't win!

44:00.680 --> 44:01.680
Not this way.

44:03.160 --> 44:05.231
No. You're wrong, Conall.

44:07.120 --> 44:09.510
We have something
they didn't plan on.

44:11.960 --> 44:13.758
We have her.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.798
She holds powers
none of us possess.

44:23.080 --> 44:24.480
She is wounded, Borra.

44:25.920 --> 44:27.240
Who are you?

44:38.920 --> 44:39.990
Hmm.

44:42.240 --> 44:43.435
Hmm.

44:43.840 --> 44:45.991
You reek of human.

44:47.920 --> 44:49.559
Maybe I was wrong about you.

44:50.080 --> 44:52.151
Or maybe Conall should have
left you for dead

44:52.240 --> 44:53.560
at the bottom of the sea.

44:57.520 --> 44:58.715
No.

45:00.240 --> 45:02.277
It's there, isn't it?

45:03.880 --> 45:05.109
It's inside you.

45:06.200 --> 45:07.200
Mmm.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.399
Ahhh!

45:24.200 --> 45:25.270
You see?

45:29.480 --> 45:31.676
You see what's inside her?

45:33.480 --> 45:35.153
That is what will save us all.

45:53.280 --> 45:54.794
You saved me.

45:58.480 --> 45:59.709
Come.

46:04.480 --> 46:06.756
Let me show you who we are.

47:02.720 --> 47:03.915
We're Dark Fey.

47:05.600 --> 47:07.000
Same as you.

47:18.760 --> 47:19.960
We're all that remain.

47:21.760 --> 47:24.320
Unseen here,
far away from mankind.

47:24.680 --> 47:25.716
Look!

47:27.280 --> 47:28.800
As more
human kingdoms emerged,

47:28.840 --> 47:29.840
we went into hiding...

47:30.560 --> 47:32.631
from every corner
of the earth...

47:33.000 --> 47:35.799
doing what we had to,
to survive.

47:36.240 --> 47:38.880
But many were lost.

48:01.480 --> 48:03.836
Only a few
generations ago...

48:04.000 --> 48:06.231
our kind roamed
every part of the world.

48:07.680 --> 48:08.909
The tundra.

48:09.080 --> 48:10.400
The forest.

48:10.560 --> 48:11.914
The jungle.

48:15.960 --> 48:17.872
The desert.

48:22.400 --> 48:26.155
Now,
our only refuge is here...

48:26.320 --> 48:27.913
in this cave.

48:28.080 --> 48:30.117
Our nest of origin.

48:34.520 --> 48:37.080
Listen. Play in the wind.

48:38.840 --> 48:39.840
Go!

49:00.040 --> 49:01.296
Those children
should be soaring

49:01.320 --> 49:03.357
over the trees and rivers.

49:03.520 --> 49:05.432
Instead,
they are raised in exile.

49:06.080 --> 49:07.514
I could protect them.

49:09.360 --> 49:11.955
How? By waging war
against the humans?

49:12.120 --> 49:14.032
I've been at war with them
my whole life.

49:14.200 --> 49:15.236
Not all of them.

49:16.200 --> 49:18.510
There was one you raised
as your own.

49:20.920 --> 49:23.879
Maybe we don't have to hide
from the humans.

49:24.040 --> 49:25.952
Maybe we can exist
without fear...

49:26.120 --> 49:27.918
and war.

49:28.400 --> 49:30.756
Find a way together.

49:32.520 --> 49:34.273
That will never happen.

50:02.240 --> 50:03.833
Oh.

50:20.600 --> 50:22.114
Whoa.

50:28.920 --> 50:30.149
Whoa!

50:53.600 --> 50:55.557
Ow! Oh.

50:56.280 --> 50:57.280
Huh?

51:06.400 --> 51:07.400
Gotcha!

51:11.520 --> 51:15.560
Welcome to your new home.

51:34.600 --> 51:36.990
We've been worried
about you, dear.

51:38.040 --> 51:39.040
Your Majesty.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.878
I couldn't find her.

51:42.040 --> 51:44.680
My heart breaks for you.

51:45.720 --> 51:47.996
She has brought
a cloud of darkness

51:48.080 --> 51:49.150
upon your happiness.

51:50.280 --> 51:52.670
I know she was
against this marriage.

51:53.280 --> 51:56.159
Never trusted your instincts
as a queen.

51:56.680 --> 51:59.240
When I saw her at dinner...

52:00.560 --> 52:03.314
with her horns covered...

52:05.760 --> 52:07.433
bent cowering...

52:12.240 --> 52:15.836
Well, it's no wonder
that she lashed out.

52:16.880 --> 52:18.394
I just don't know what to do.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.720
You do truly love him,
don't you?

52:21.880 --> 52:23.314
My son.

52:23.800 --> 52:24.800
Deeply.

52:26.120 --> 52:28.715
It is love that will heal you.

52:29.520 --> 52:31.159
It's what heals us all.

52:31.960 --> 52:35.192
Let's move forward together...

52:36.040 --> 52:37.713
as a family.

52:54.200 --> 52:57.034
<i>To all who live
on the Moors...</i>

52:59.080 --> 53:01.117
What is that noise?

53:01.320 --> 53:02.913
...<i>and kingdoms
far and wide,</i>

53:03.000 --> 53:04.275
<i>the king and queen
invite you...</i>

53:04.440 --> 53:06.477
<i>to attend the wedding...</i>

53:07.000 --> 53:09.959
<i>of their son Philip to Aurora
in three days' time.</i>

53:10.800 --> 53:12.439
<i>All are welcome.</i>

53:12.520 --> 53:13.520
Huh?

53:15.440 --> 53:18.114
<i>And all are expected!</i>

53:19.400 --> 53:21.869
Did you hear that?
We're invited to the castle!

53:22.040 --> 53:24.111
I knew Aurora
wouldn't abandon us!

53:24.280 --> 53:26.351
I always knew I'd be invited.

53:26.520 --> 53:28.671
Just glad you two
made the cut.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.238
Who's getting married?

53:39.480 --> 53:43.315
Aurora, we don't have to think
about the wedding right now.

53:44.720 --> 53:46.473
The queen is right.

53:46.720 --> 53:48.951
We owe it to everyone...

53:49.440 --> 53:51.636
especially the king.

53:52.480 --> 53:54.472
What about Maleficent?

53:57.600 --> 53:59.717
She's gone.

54:12.480 --> 54:13.914
The Phoenix.

54:14.080 --> 54:16.436
It is said the Dark Fey
began with her...

54:17.800 --> 54:19.837
evolved over centuries.

54:21.640 --> 54:23.916
You are the last
of her descendants.

54:24.720 --> 54:27.076
Her blood is your own.

54:28.760 --> 54:30.513
You are her.

54:33.800 --> 54:37.237
In your hands, you hold
the power of life and death...

54:37.400 --> 54:40.199
destruction and rebirth.

54:41.520 --> 54:43.955
But nature's greatest power

54:44.040 --> 54:47.192
is the power
of true transformation.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.232
You transformed
when you raised Aurora.

54:54.120 --> 54:56.316
When you found love...

54:56.520 --> 54:59.592
in the middle of your pain.

55:01.280 --> 55:03.920
I'm asking you
to take all of your fury...

55:04.720 --> 55:06.393
all of your pain...

55:06.920 --> 55:09.389
and not use it.

55:09.560 --> 55:12.837
Help us broker peace
with the humans.

55:14.640 --> 55:15.756
Because peace...

55:16.600 --> 55:21.117
could be the Dark Fey's
final transformation.

55:28.560 --> 55:31.758
The Moors are
our last true nature on earth.

55:32.760 --> 55:36.197
And yet you named
a human as queen.

55:36.880 --> 55:39.520
A daughter you cared for.

55:41.600 --> 55:43.751
I have no daughter.

55:46.440 --> 55:48.750
She has chosen her side.

56:01.160 --> 56:02.799
We've just heard.

56:03.360 --> 56:06.080
There's going to be a wedding
at the castle in three days.

56:07.680 --> 56:09.876
Humans will come
from all over.

56:10.400 --> 56:12.232
That's when we attack.

56:12.400 --> 56:15.154
We'll kill the king and queen
of Ulstead...

56:15.320 --> 56:17.312
and their young prince.

56:20.080 --> 56:22.197
Their kingdom will fall.

56:22.800 --> 56:25.395
And the Fey will rise again.

56:41.240 --> 56:43.835
The fairies made it.

56:58.680 --> 57:02.390
I wore it
when I married the king.

57:09.080 --> 57:11.993
I'm sure it's perfect.

57:12.560 --> 57:13.960
So am I.

57:20.040 --> 57:22.236
Your Majesty,
she's absolutely lovely.

57:22.760 --> 57:24.440
Considering
how she was raised.

57:24.520 --> 57:26.910
By the same evil witch
who cursed her.

57:27.480 --> 57:30.200
It's a miracle Prince Philip
came along.

57:30.360 --> 57:31.480
It's a miracle

57:31.520 --> 57:33.318
the poor child is alive
at all.

57:34.600 --> 57:36.512
Thank you so much.

57:36.720 --> 57:37.720
It's exquisite.

58:08.240 --> 58:09.879
<i>When I'm older...</i>

58:10.040 --> 58:11.880
I'm going to live here,
in the Moors, with you.

58:12.920 --> 58:15.310
Then we can
look after each other.

58:36.640 --> 58:39.120
- Tell me what's troubling you.
- It's nothing.

58:39.760 --> 58:42.320
Aurora,
I know you better than that.

58:45.160 --> 58:46.355
This jewelry...

58:47.280 --> 58:48.600
my hair...

58:48.760 --> 58:50.877
all these rules.

58:50.960 --> 58:53.520
I can't breathe.

58:54.600 --> 58:57.195
I feel like I'm not
Queen of the Moors anymore.

58:57.560 --> 58:59.552
I feel like
a different person.

58:59.960 --> 59:01.155
Listen...

59:01.800 --> 59:05.157
I fell in love with a girl
in the forest and only her.

59:05.320 --> 59:06.834
You don't have to change.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.117
I don't want you to change.

59:17.400 --> 59:20.438
I should have never asked her
to wear that scarf.

59:39.680 --> 59:40.955
Ah, yes.

59:43.080 --> 59:44.400
Well...

59:45.240 --> 59:47.038
Does it work?

59:47.200 --> 59:48.873
I only have a handful

59:48.960 --> 59:50.136
of fairy specimens
to work with...

59:50.160 --> 59:52.629
and the extraction process
is painstaking.

59:53.600 --> 59:55.353
Extraction from what?

59:56.360 --> 59:58.477
Tomb Bloom flowers.

59:58.640 --> 59:59.840
They grow from
a fairy's grave,

59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.479
contain their very essence.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.472
When you mix the pollen
with iron powder...

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.439
the resulting dust
ends a fairy's life.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.239
We will need thousands more.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.395
Show me.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.476
Show me.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.960
Very well.

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.080
So...

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:14.109
Finally,
the Moors will be mine.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.633
No more fairies.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.116
Stay alert, men.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.119
Wow!

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.136
This is where
I found them.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.160
Excellent.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.359
But what if
the winged one returns?

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.432
Don't you worry about that.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.360
We'll be ready.

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.670
Take the Tomb Blooms.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.352
Get to work!

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.120
Sentries, stay alert!

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.600
Keep your weapons on hand.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.520
Move it!

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.960
Maleficent...

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.873
This is where
we bury our dead.

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.038
They've destroyed it.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.672
This is what the humans do.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.431
They're nothing but locusts
that swarm the earth.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.273
We have to stop them.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:20.037
You spent years
caring for a human...

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:23.193
now it's time
to care for your own.

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:33.796
Fire!

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:57.153
Reload! We go again!

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.515
Fire!

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.589
Reload!
There's another one!

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.438
Everyone, stay together!

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.273
We're about to leave
the Moors.

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:31.920
Grab the hand or the wing...

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.436
or the tail of whoever
is closest to you.

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.000
Hey, over here!
Yeah, over here!

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.515
Hold formation, guards.
Hold formation.

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.797
- Excuse me, sir.
- Stop right there.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:25.996
I'm with the bride.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.152
We've been told
to let the, uh, other kind

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.240
find their seats first.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.510
But I'm not a human.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.433
- I'm a raven.
- What?

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.717
A raven. The black bird.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.471
Mmm. This rice is delicious.

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.040
You're supposed
to throw it

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.196
at the bride and groom.

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.750
What? And waste good rice?

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.056
What's the hold up?

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.196
Let me in!

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.317
Why can't humans come in, too?

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.559
Why can't we come in?

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.056
I know it's bad luck...

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.753
but I had to see you.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.589
For you.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.399
A Tomb Bloom?

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:07.600
Where did you get this?

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.680
From my mother.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:12.034
The sun's up.
It's our wedding day.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.876
<i>From my mother.</i>

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.759
Where should we sit, Flittle?

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.798
On the left.
We're with the bride.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:16.474
Yes, we are.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.393
But the groom's lovely, too.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.233
Mmm. Yes, he is.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.514
I'm with both.

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.997
Huh?

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.598
Now.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.719
What's this?

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.553
Nobody is allowed in here
except me.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.474
And I'm already here,
so go away!

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:23.154
Maleficent, please stop.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.913
Maleficent.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.514
She didn't do it.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:38.240
Get out!

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.110
Before I call the guards!

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.560
The missing fairies.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.000
I said get out.
Did you hear me?

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.277
What have you done?

01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.839
You're a pixie.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.275
How dare you call me that?

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:03.437
I'm Lickspittle,
the nobleman...

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.319
and I serve the queen.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.316
She took your wings.

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.354
We have to release them.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.553
They belong on the Moors.

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:16.776
As you do, Aurora.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:22.277
A human who has betrayed
her kind.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.753
You put the curse on the king.

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.474
Oh, dear.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.952
You may be queen...

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.874
but you are very young.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.875
Ruling humans
is a bit more complicated...

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:44.235
than running around barefoot
with flowers in your hair.

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.112
When I was young...

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.275
my family's kingdom
bordered the Moors.

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:57.673
And one
particularly harsh winter...

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.479
our crops died...

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.439
and the people
began to suffer.

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.915
And as we looked
over our walls...

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.118
we could see
the fairies thriving.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:13.034
My brother and I believed we
should take what we needed...

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:18.320
while my father, the king,
sought their kindness.

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:21.197
Choosing peace
over our people,

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.112
he sent my brother
to do his bidding.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.837
He never came back.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:28.800
Those savages...

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.440
creatures who could
barely grunt,

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.955
let alone engage in talks,
killed him.

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.035
I don't believe that.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:36.515
Our people became fearful.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.320
They overthrew my father.

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.439
The land fell into chaos.
I was cast out.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:47.678
Forced by fate into marriage
with King John of Ulstead.

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.072
Another weak king

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:52.277
speaking of
tolerance and civility.

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:55.150
And now, my own son...

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.518
corrupted with visions
of harmony.

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.789
But peace
will not be our downfall.

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.678
Now lock her up.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.792
A war is coming.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.557
No! No!

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.390
I wish you could be here
with me.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.119
Conall wanted peace...

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:46.074
<i>and they filled him with iron.</i>

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:49.950
Now, we will have our war.

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.158
Our fight begins now!

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.914
We will rise together!

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.231
We fight together.

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:04.838
And we will show them
no mercy!

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.991
Come on! Go!

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.233
Go! Go!

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.960
Go! Go! Go!

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.598
Where are all Philip's guests?

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:51.991
- Humans are poor timekeepers.
- Mmm.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.916
Start the music.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.376
Come on! Come on!

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:45.480
She's gone.

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:48.156
Hey!

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:01.029
It's a trap! Get down!

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.154
Your Majesty...

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.670
they're coming from the sea.

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:35.360
She escaped!

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.077
Down this way, come on!

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.080
Your Highness.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.674
Upon my command.

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.469
Check every room!

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:09.990
She can't be far!

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:43.960
Wait.

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:46.590
Wait.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.993
What's going on?

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:17.280
Now.

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:18.716
Fire!

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.496
No!

01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:58.231
They look just like her.

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:05.950
Withdraw!

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:08.639
Pull back!

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.154
Maleficent's starting a war.

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:12.511
First my father, and now this.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.831
Philip! She didn't curse him.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.639
- Maleficent.
- What?

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:18.833
She never cursed him.

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.599
It was your mother.

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.989
What are you saying?

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.355
It was the spindle.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.159
The curse is still in it.

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.160
Your mother used it
against your father.

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.320
Look.

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:40.720
It's the same.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:44.115
She's locked the Moor folk
in the chapel.

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:45.509
This isn't a wedding.

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:47.672
It's a trap.

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.790
Remember where you came from.

01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:57.757
Remember who you are.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.912
I've made my choice.

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.072
You'll have to make yours.

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.874
Stay low!

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.316
Divide!

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.114
Follow me!

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:53.116
Attack!

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:55.994
Attack!

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.793
- Ignite!
- Ignite!

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:20.109
No!

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:05.869
Aunties! Aunties!

01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.434
It's too heavy!

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:12.989
Aurora!

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:14.355
Diaval! You're here.

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:19.359
Oh, what's happening?

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:41.120
Weapon change!

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:44.275
Weapon change! Go!

01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:25.640
Mother!

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:27.914
You have to stop this.

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:29.554
We are at war.

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:31.598
This isn't a war.
It's a massacre.

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:33.274
Philip, you don't understand.

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:36.114
These creatures stand
between us...

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:38.875
and everything
we need to survive.

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.269
You're wrong.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:41.840
We can stand together.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.720
Well, you're a fool
to believe that.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:48.157
You don't know what it takes
to fight for our kind.

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.360
You lied to me.

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.357
I am protecting the kingdom...

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.791
and your throne.

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:57.429
What about Father?

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:02.078
Were you protecting him, too?

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:06.830
The prince
is not feeling well.

01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.872
See him to his chambers.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:14.720
Now.

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:20.435
Sire, stop!

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:49.670
Yield! Yield!

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:50.840
My mother cursed the king

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:52.016
so she could destroy
the Moor folk.

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.157
Your men
are paying heavily for it.

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.077
We have to do something!

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.440
Goodbye, girls.

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.553
No, come back!

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:13.673
Flittle! No!

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.560
No!

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:29.552
Hey, you, stay with your own!

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:31.714
Run, Aurora, run!

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:33.553
Let him go!

01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:40.271
No! No!

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:08.999
Godmother.

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:09.199
For Flittle!

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:20.150
We've got her!

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:35.880
Huh?

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.679
Go! Go!

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:11.400
This way! This way!

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:12.520
Go!

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:57.114
Stand down!

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:00.354
This is not my fight.

01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:03.675
My mother wanted a war,
and you're giving it to her.

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:08.359
I won't allow her hatred
to ruin my kingdom or yours.

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:28.558
There will be no Fey blood
on my hands.

01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:52.437
This way!
This way!

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.471
Maleficent's back!

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:03.629
She's going for the queen.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.192
Yield! Yield!

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.360
Stand down!

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:13.880
Lower your weapons!

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.954
There's the evil
that I promised them.

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:35.200
Your kind is more predictable
than humans.

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:42.760
Stop!

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.600
Stop!

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.837
Well, almost.

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:48.196
Stop.

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:51.353
I'm sorry I doubted you,
but this isn't you.

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.518
There's another way.

01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:54.875
I know who you are.

01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:59.750
I know you.

01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:01.800
You do not.

01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:06.436
Yes, I do.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.832
You're my mother.

01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:45.280
No!

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:03.509
Do you know what
makes a great leader, Aurora?

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:07.912
The ability to instill fear
in your subjects...

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:09.275
and then use that fear...

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.400
Your Majesty.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.196
...against your enemies.

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:15.953
So...

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.357
I spread the story
of the evil witch...

01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:23.160
and the princess she cursed.

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:27.875
It didn't matter
who woke Sleeping Beauty.

01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:30.717
They were all terrified.

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:34.032
And the story became legend.

01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:38.397
I know you think
I'm a monster.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.950
But what I did to the king,
to Maleficent, to my son...

01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:47.713
I did for Ulstead.

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:50.475
You are a traitor
to your kind,

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:52.313
and you will pay for it.

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.511
Maleficent is dead!

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.716
We will never again
live in fear!

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.520
Get back here!

01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:09.356
Ulstead is free at last!

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:12.239
Let me go!

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:21.950
What's happening?

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.432
Well, well.

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:52.551
Hello, Beasty.

01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:12.236
I missed you.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.514
Did you bump your head, then?

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.150
I did.

01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:21.474
Philip.

01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:23.354
Yes?

01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:27.032
Do you love my daughter?

01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:31.315
With everything I have.

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:41.755
Good.

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:53.638
I believe this belongs to you.

01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:02.397
Curses don't end.

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.279
They're broken.

01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:31.399
It ends.

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:39.512
There will be
no more fighting.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.560
Ulstead will never attack
the Moors again.

01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:43.995
And from this day on...

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:46.996
we move forward...

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:49.750
and find our way...

01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:52.274
in peace.

01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.240
Together.

01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:59.870
Today,
there will be a wedding.

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:03.631
Not just a union
of two people...

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:06.833
but a union of two kingdoms.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.480
And all are invited...

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:11.557
all are safe...

01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:13.916
and all are welcome.

01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:49.833
Hello, there.

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:33.838
We cannot live
amongst monsters...

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:42.478
Someone should
really cover those horns.

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:01.273
If only Conall could see you.

01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:04.440
Borra...

01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:08.831
it's time to come home.

01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:16.720
Hello.

01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:20.237
Can you come here?

01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:31.830
Yes?

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:35.558
Will you give me away?

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:37.400
Never.

01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:39.880
No.

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:42.000
Will you walk me
down the aisle?

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:44.199
Ah.

01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:47.600
Yes.

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:13.151
Apologies to anyone
I might have mauled today.

01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:26.520
Is that...?

01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:29.158
She can change her back.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.116
I suppose.

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:34.956
Only if we wanted to.

01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:36.994
Father.

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:43.871
I'm so glad to see you.

01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:46.077
I've dreamed of this moment.

01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:48.516
Two kingdoms united at last.

01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:51.271
And it's because of you.

01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:54.600
I'm so proud of you. So proud.

01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:25.195
She looks better in green.

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:26.510
Pink, you mean.

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:30.956
No, in green.

01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:32.640
Pink.

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.080
- Green.
- Pink.

01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:38.554
Flittle!

01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:41.030
It's perfect.

01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:27.198
Let her go.

01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:43.196
Pull yourself together.

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:46.672
We are here to join
two kingdoms...

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:48.479
divided by fear.

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:51.277
Today, you teach us

01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:54.393
we are not defined
by where we are from...

01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.756
but by whom we love.

01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:00.393
The bands, please.

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:17.839
Do you, Philip,
take Aurora...

01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:18.920
I do.

01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:21.816
And do you,
Aurora, take...

01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:22.840
I do.

01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:27.116
Then I pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:29.317
You may kiss the bride.

01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:01.156
You're smiling.

01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:25.753
It's a new day.

01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:29.999
It is.

01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:42.596
Morning.

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:45.551
Will you stay awhile?

01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:46.989
A little while.

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:49.278
But don't worry...

01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:51.955
I'll see you
at the christening.

01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:10.080
Hmm.

01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:12.800
Hmm.

01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:21.633
<i>Oh</i>

01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:24.713
<i>They tryna shoot down angels</i>

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.356
<i>They tryna pull
their wings off</i>

01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:31.232
<i>So they can't fly</i>

01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:33.840
<i>And, oh</i>

01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:36.956
<i>But she's so brave, though</i>

01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:40.275
<i>Just like a tornado</i>

01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:43.594
<i>She's taking us by storm</i>

01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:46.832
<i>You can't stop the girl
from going</i>

01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:49.913
<i>You can't stop the world
from knowing</i>

01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:56.150
<i>The truth will set you free
Oh</i>

01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:59.438
<i>You can't stop the girl
from going</i>

01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:02.519
<i>You can't stop the world
from knowing</i>

01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:08.830
<i>The truth will set you free
Oh</i>

01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:11.475
<i>You can't stop the girl</i>

01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:15.079
<i>They tryna take our voices</i>

01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:18.200
<i>They tryna make our choices</i>

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:22.715
<i>So we scream loud, loud, loud</i>

01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:24.718
<i>And, oh</i>

01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:27.993
<i>I know you feel the lightnin'</i>

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:31.153
<i>And it's so excitin'</i>

01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:34.279
<i>So, here we come</i>

01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:37.353
<i>You can't stop the girl
from going</i>

01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:40.240
<i>You can't stop the world
from knowing</i>

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:46.915
<i>The truth will set you free
Oh</i>

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.993
<i>You can't stop the girl
from going</i>

01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:52.993
<i>You can't stop the world
from knowing</i>

01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:59.276
<i>The truth will set you free
Oh</i>

01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:03.149
<i>You can't stop the girl</i>

01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:11.791
<i>You can't stop the girl</i>

01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:16.319
<i>You can't stop the girl</i>

01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:25.079
<i>No, you can't stop the girl</i>

01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:27.669
<i>Oh</i>

01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:30.955
<i>I know you feel the lightnin'</i>

01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:34.520
<i>And it's so excitin'</i>

01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:39.434
<i>So, here we come</i>
