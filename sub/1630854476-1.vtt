00:50.049 --> 00:51.634
I'm here. Sorry, Mr. Taylor.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.219
You were up 20 minutes ago.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.637
Why are you still here?
Just get out there.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.514
-Okay.
-Hold on, hold on. Come back.

00:56.598 --> 00:59.517
This is a pub.
Pubs love holidays.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.394
Uh, no. December just started.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.396
Christmas starts the day
after Thanksgiving.
Just blame the Internet.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.231
So, it's either these lights...

01:05.315 --> 01:07.233
or Janice's sweater.
You choose.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.071
Fine.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.531
Hey.

01:13.615 --> 01:14.824
-Lila.
-Stop.

01:14.908 --> 01:15.867
They're so colorful.

01:15.950 --> 01:18.119
They're cute. Stop. Here.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.329
There you go.

01:21.748 --> 01:22.832
You ready to do the thing?

01:22.916 --> 01:24.626
-I was born ready.
-Okay, let's go.

01:26.127 --> 01:29.547
-Thank you, Lila.
-Got you, Mr. Taylor.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.758
-Hurry up. Before he comes.
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

01:31.841 --> 01:33.843
Yeah. Excuse me.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.768
Phone. Phone. Phone.

01:51.444 --> 01:54.155
Hey, everyone.
Name's Gail Travers.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.032
I'm 25, um...

01:56.115 --> 01:58.535
I'm from, well, everywhere,

01:58.618 --> 02:01.162
and this is "For the Crowd"
by Everly.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.581
And thank you so much
for this opportunity.

02:27.146 --> 02:28.690
Requests only.

02:28.773 --> 02:30.859
All right. Okay. All right.

02:30.942 --> 02:34.028
Um, anyone have
any requests for me?
Requests?

02:34.112 --> 02:35.405
-Anyone?
-Hey.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.240
How about, uh, Pat Benatar?

02:37.323 --> 02:39.742
Oh! You got good taste.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.077
I think I got
something for you.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.653
Well, it was
worth a try, right?

03:15.737 --> 03:18.948
Uh... five artists picked
to be opening acts

03:19.032 --> 03:21.034
on iHeart Radio's
Christmas Eve Special...

03:21.117 --> 03:25.496
plus a spot on a tour
and a three-year contract?

03:25.580 --> 03:27.290
Yes. It's worth it.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.792
And it would've looked
profesh on that stage,

03:29.876 --> 03:32.086
but it will be just
as good from anywhere.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.339
Because it's you.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.049
You're the best.

03:36.132 --> 03:37.258
I hope you're right.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.218
I'm always right.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.095
Will you please take these
off me? Take 'em off.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.180
Okay.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.807
Okay.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.352
Yes. They look
way better on you.

03:47.435 --> 03:48.519
'Tis the season.

03:49.854 --> 03:51.689
-Oh, here. Don't forget this.
-Oh, God.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.651
-Thank you. All right,
I'll see you later.
-Bye.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.078
Tell me I'm good.

04:05.161 --> 04:06.162
You're good.

04:08.998 --> 04:12.377
-Okay. We're rolling.

04:12.460 --> 04:15.755
<i>My name is Gail Travers.</i>
<i>I'm from Miami, Florida.</i>

04:15.838 --> 04:17.507
<i>Or at least that's what</i>
<i>they tell me.</i>

04:17.590 --> 04:19.092
<i>And this is "For the Crowd"</i>

04:19.175 --> 04:22.095
<i>by one of my favorite</i>
<i>indie artists Everly.</i>

05:53.227 --> 05:54.854
Got it.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.485
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

06:00.568 --> 06:03.780
You are the real deal,
Gail Travers.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.698
You should write
your own stuff.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.409
-Hmm.
-I bet it'd be wicked good.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.786
I don't know.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.622
I don't think I can
write songs like that.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.583
I've tried. I've tried...

06:15.666 --> 06:19.420
but they just
never felt inspired.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.506
Inspiration finds you,
you know?

06:23.216 --> 06:24.884
You just have to let it happen.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.637
Wait, what are you doing?

06:27.720 --> 06:30.014
-I'm editing it.
-You're taking out your ritual?

06:31.140 --> 06:32.767
It's you.

06:32.850 --> 06:34.352
Show them you.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.566
Done.

06:42.735 --> 06:43.903
They're gonna love you.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.905
Lila, it's iHeart Radio.

06:45.988 --> 06:49.033
Five spots out of, what,
hundreds of thousands?

06:49.117 --> 06:51.452
-Come on.
-Hey. If it doesn't happen...

06:51.536 --> 06:54.664
someone somewhere will give you
the chance you deserve.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.333
And plus, right place,
right time...

06:57.416 --> 07:01.003
it's bound to happen with you
running all over the place
in this tin can of yours.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.339
Hey! Cool it with the tin can.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.800
Jewel is a sensitive princess.

07:05.883 --> 07:06.884
Be nice.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.222
Or what if you stay in Tampa
for a little while

07:11.305 --> 07:13.141
and take a break from van life?

07:13.224 --> 07:15.560
I could, but, you know...

07:15.643 --> 07:18.396
The open road,
it calls my name.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.231
-You're crazy.

07:20.314 --> 07:21.399
I gotta go.

07:21.482 --> 07:22.942
Wait. What about your lights?

07:23.025 --> 07:24.694
-Just put 'em in the back.
-Okay.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.529
-Love you.
-Bye.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.905
<i>One-year vanlife-iversary.</i>

08:08.988 --> 08:11.532
<i>One year, one van.</i>

08:11.616 --> 08:12.992
<i>I did it.</i>

08:13.075 --> 08:15.953
<i>#wheretonext</i>

08:29.884 --> 08:32.345
Okay! Oh, my God!

08:35.306 --> 08:38.309
Okay, okay, okay.

08:38.392 --> 08:39.936
I made it! I got a spot!

08:40.019 --> 08:42.647
No. No!
Oh, my God. You made it!

08:42.730 --> 08:43.898
I know!

08:45.107 --> 08:46.234
Congratulations.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.321
Thanks. Thanks.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.200
God. Oh, my God.

08:54.283 --> 08:55.993
<i> Okay, uh...</i>

08:56.077 --> 08:59.288
You better text me every single
stop you make on the way, okay?

08:59.372 --> 09:00.331
You can say it.

09:00.414 --> 09:01.791
I told you so!

09:02.625 --> 09:03.793
I'll talk to you later.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.002
<i>Bye.</i>

09:17.723 --> 09:18.891
Whoo!

09:18.975 --> 09:21.644
That's right.
I'm back on the road.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.229
It's just me...

09:23.312 --> 09:25.690
my guitar and America.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.984
I'll be hitting up
open mic nights

09:28.067 --> 09:31.028
from Florida all the way to LA.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.030
"Why?" you may ask.

09:33.114 --> 09:36.951
Well, it's just one long
rehearsal for...

09:37.034 --> 09:38.953
drumroll...

09:39.036 --> 09:42.373
opening iHeart Radio's
Christmas Eve Special...

09:42.456 --> 09:45.418
with some of the top
artists in the country.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.503
Let's be real for a sec.

09:47.586 --> 09:51.007
I was homeless before
I bought my bus, Jewel, here.

09:51.090 --> 09:55.553
I had no idea where my voice
was going to take me...

09:55.636 --> 09:59.390
and now I'm making by debut
on national TV...

09:59.473 --> 10:01.183
thanks to you guys.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.519
I gotta earn some gas money,
friends...

10:04.395 --> 10:06.022
so, help your girl out.

10:06.105 --> 10:09.442
<i>First stop, tonight,</i>
<i>at Catch and Go Brews</i>

10:09.525 --> 10:11.527
<i>in Mobile, Alabama.</i>

10:22.121 --> 10:24.040
<i>Thanks for a great turnout.</i>

10:24.123 --> 10:27.585
<i>What a hello</i>
<i>from the wonderful city</i>
<i>of Shreveport. Go Tigers!</i>

10:34.383 --> 10:39.138
<i>Just booked one night at</i>

10:39.221 --> 10:43.184

11:22.014 --> 11:23.432
Wow!

11:23.516 --> 11:26.602
So many new friends
joining us today.

11:26.685 --> 11:29.605
Must find coffee.
My machine's busted.

11:29.688 --> 11:31.107
#vanlife.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.233
I'm still in Oklahoma...

11:32.316 --> 11:34.026
if anyone
has any food stop recs

11:34.110 --> 11:35.945
along the way to Santa Fe.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.280
Trying to line up the next gig.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.698
Check in later for deets.

12:14.733 --> 12:15.985
Good morning. Who's this?

12:16.068 --> 12:17.820
<i>It's Walker with iHeart.</i>

12:17.903 --> 12:19.655
Ah, it's nice
to meet you, Walker.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.991
I'm... I'm so excited
for this opportunity.

12:22.074 --> 12:25.286
<i>-Are you preparing a song?</i>
<i>-Yes,</i> yes. Song, um...

12:25.369 --> 12:26.996
I love oldies...

12:27.079 --> 12:28.956
anything soulful,
I can spin acoustics.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.542
<i>Well, we'll need you</i>
<i>to perform an original.</i>

12:32.209 --> 12:33.669
An original?

12:34.795 --> 12:36.380
You want a new song?

12:36.464 --> 12:38.340
An original new song?

12:38.424 --> 12:41.093
I haven't written anything.
I mean, that's kind
of a fast turnaround.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.761
<i>-If you'd like to pull out...</i>
-No, no, no.

12:42.845 --> 12:46.682
I would not like to pull out.
No. Uh, I'll have one.

12:46.765 --> 12:47.975
<i>-Excellent.</i>
-Yes.

12:48.058 --> 12:50.686
An original song.
In two weeks.

12:50.769 --> 12:52.563
<i>-Think festive.</i>
-Copy that. You got it.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.940
-I'll be there.
<i>-Great. See you in two weeks.</i>

12:55.024 --> 12:56.734
Bye.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.320
Okay, okay,
okay. Relax.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.749
Oh, my. Oh, my God.

13:11.832 --> 13:14.251
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.753
Oh, my God.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.755
Oh, my God.

13:17.838 --> 13:18.964
Oh, my God.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.594
No. Oh, my God.
Oh, my, no, no, no.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.137
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.473
Hey, hey, hey.
Are you okay? Are you okay?

13:27.556 --> 13:29.725
-Are you hurt?
Are you hurt now?
-I'm fine.

13:29.808 --> 13:31.769
I just killed a llama.

13:31.852 --> 13:34.063
It's an alpaca.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.648
Did I kill him? It? Her?

13:35.731 --> 13:37.733
-Okay, calm down.
-They? Do llamas have pronouns?

13:37.816 --> 13:39.527
Calm down. Here,
take some food.
Take some food.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.487
No, no, no. I couldn't
possibly eat right now.

13:41.570 --> 13:42.821
It's for Eddie.

13:42.905 --> 13:46.659
This little guy,
he perks right up for a snack.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.202
-Don't we all?

13:48.285 --> 13:50.746
All right, here,
I'll go check on him.

13:50.829 --> 13:53.207
Oh, my God. Are you going
to drag him off the road
by its neck?

13:54.750 --> 13:58.045
He's alive.
And he's up.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.797
-Come on, Eddie.
-Hi, Eddie.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.340
You silly little rascal.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.508
I didn't get your name.

14:02.591 --> 14:03.759
Gail.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.052
Well, Gail, meet Eddie.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.054
Well, you see,
you completely missed him

14:07.137 --> 14:10.599
but this little guy just loved
playin' dead. Don't you?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.768
Especially, when it's time
to saddle him up...

14:12.851 --> 14:15.437
for the Christmas card photos
with the town folk.

14:15.521 --> 14:18.440
Give him a hat
and he's good to go.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.984
This gal here, though...

14:20.859 --> 14:21.902
she is not good to go.

14:22.736 --> 14:23.779
Where are you headed?

14:23.862 --> 14:26.615
Santa Fe and then LA.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.200
I don't think
I can get you that far,

14:28.284 --> 14:31.453
but why don't I tow you
into my shop in town.

14:31.537 --> 14:32.955
You're a lifesaver.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.165
Oh, it's the least I could do.
Now, do me a favor

14:35.249 --> 14:40.087
and you be nice to Gail now,
Eddie, okay? No spitting.

14:40.170 --> 14:44.133
-Uh, I didn't catch your name.
-Oh. It's Savannah.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.802
But people around here,
they just call me Van.

14:46.885 --> 14:48.304
Oh.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.639
A woman named "Van"
is gonna fix my van.

14:51.557 --> 14:52.933
Where the hell am I?

14:53.017 --> 14:55.769
Welcome to Harmony Springs,
Oklahoma.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.239
You think
I can hitch a ride

15:07.323 --> 15:08.866
to the nearest Verizon store?

15:08.949 --> 15:11.243
No Verizon
on the horizon here, darlin'.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.829
Your best bet's gonna be
a gas station

15:13.912 --> 15:15.205
that sells walkie-talkies

15:15.289 --> 15:17.708
and that would be about
50 miles that way.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.335
Can I borrow your phone?

15:19.418 --> 15:20.628
Absolutely.

15:21.670 --> 15:22.921
Here you go.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.009
Buttons all work,
just call who you like.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.178
I was gonna update my story.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.138
-Your what?
-My story.

15:31.221 --> 15:32.848
We all got a story, darlin'.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.018
-Hey, you play the guitar?
-Yeah.

15:37.978 --> 15:39.063
No.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.648
No, no, no.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.859
No. It's broken.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.861
-Oh, I am so sorry.

15:45.944 --> 15:49.198
What am I gonna do?
This is bad. This is so bad.

15:49.281 --> 15:50.741
-Oh!
-It ain't that bad,

15:50.824 --> 15:52.409
but it ain't good either.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.535
This is Jeremy.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.287
Best mechanic in Oklahoma,

15:55.371 --> 15:57.206
also happens to be my son.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.582
Now,

15:58.666 --> 16:02.419
I like her so I want you
to be optimistic, okay?

16:02.503 --> 16:04.630
How is she lookin'?

16:04.713 --> 16:06.715
If we cut deals
for everyone you like, Mom,

16:06.799 --> 16:07.758
we'd run out of business.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.387
I mean, I can fix it...

16:11.470 --> 16:12.680
but a vintage ride like this,

16:12.763 --> 16:14.473
it's gonna take a minute
to get the parts.

16:14.556 --> 16:15.808
How long of a minute?

16:16.600 --> 16:17.851
Um, two weeks.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.228
-Two weeks? No. No.
-That's what I said.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.063
And that's if
they get here on time.

16:21.146 --> 16:24.400
Well, I mean, that puts us
just before Christmas,

16:24.483 --> 16:26.360
so I can think of
no better gift

16:26.443 --> 16:28.320
than to have this beauty
running like new.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.781
I have to report
to LA by the 24th.

16:30.864 --> 16:32.116
-LA?
-Yeah.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.409
On Christmas Eve?
What's so important in LA?

16:34.118 --> 16:35.077
iHeart Radio.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.578
Fancy.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.747
If you whip him again,
will he get more optimistic?

16:38.831 --> 16:41.417
He's gonna try his hardest.
Aren't you, Jer?

16:41.500 --> 16:43.752
How much is this gonna cost?

16:43.836 --> 16:46.296
Well, with the bumper,
the axle,

16:46.380 --> 16:49.216
obviously the body work,
you're looking at about...

16:51.009 --> 16:52.678
2,600 bucks, give or take.

16:52.761 --> 16:55.305
-26...
-Yeah.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.141
Oh, excuse me.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.853
-I got... Ooh, sorry.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.312
-My tools.
-Um...

17:02.396 --> 17:05.566
I got $540.

17:05.649 --> 17:08.068
So, is that your checking
or your savings?

17:08.152 --> 17:09.528
It's my everything.

17:09.611 --> 17:10.988
Credit card?

17:11.071 --> 17:12.698
Yeah, as long as you have
a pair of scissors handy...

17:12.781 --> 17:14.783
for when the bank
tells you to cut it up.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.787
It's a start to cover
the parts.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.748
Didn't you hear me?
This is all I have.

17:20.831 --> 17:24.460
Okay. Well, hey, do you sing
with that guitar of yours?

17:24.543 --> 17:26.044
Yeah, I used to.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.504
Take her to Gus's.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.423
All right, we just added a show
to your schedule.

17:29.506 --> 17:31.049
And if you're lucky...

17:31.133 --> 17:33.719
it may just add a little bit
of cash to that bevy there.

17:33.802 --> 17:35.679
I have a lot of work
I gotta do.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.347
Well, the shop is closing
early today.

17:37.431 --> 17:38.474
Don't be rude.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.892
Go wash up, all right?

17:39.975 --> 17:42.895
And show our new guest
here some hospitality.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.609
All right, you comin'?

17:59.453 --> 18:01.246
Do you have a phone
I could borrow?

18:07.795 --> 18:11.340
Has anyone in this town
ever heard of a smartphone?

18:11.423 --> 18:13.759
There ain't no use
for fancy around here.

18:13.842 --> 18:14.968
Clearly.

18:16.345 --> 18:19.389
So, tonight's
Pass the Hat night,

18:19.473 --> 18:22.309
which means best performance
gets the pot.

18:22.392 --> 18:24.770
The pot's gonna be 2,000 bucks?

18:24.853 --> 18:27.189
Yeah, no. Far from it.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.607
But it'll be a start.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.422
Wow. This is some
serious karaoke.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.842
Yeah. Uh, two mixed.

18:54.925 --> 18:55.968
I'll have a shot.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.053
A shot?

18:58.136 --> 18:59.346
Two shots.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.140
Yeah! Whoo!

19:07.563 --> 19:10.065
Well, well.
Who do we have here?

19:11.733 --> 19:13.569
-Famous Gail Travers.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.695
Famous, huh?

19:14.778 --> 19:16.572
No, not famous.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.407
Well, I'm Scarlet.

19:18.490 --> 19:19.783
Is it too late to sign up?

19:19.867 --> 19:22.244
I'm sure they could
squeeze you in...

19:22.327 --> 19:25.622
but you gotta give
a little to win a little.

19:25.706 --> 19:26.832
Oh, here. Let me.

19:32.629 --> 19:35.549
Let's see if Little Miss Famous
stands a chance.

19:35.632 --> 19:39.595
All right, give it up for
everyone's favorite, Rachael!

19:42.389 --> 19:43.473
Always a killer.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.058
Thank you.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.395
Oh, what's this?

19:48.478 --> 19:51.398
We have one more performer.
Her name is Gladys Travelers

19:51.481 --> 19:54.943
Looks like we have
a last-minute performer
slidin' in

19:55.027 --> 19:56.820
just in the nick of time.

19:56.904 --> 20:00.407
One Gladys Travelers,
come on down!

20:00.490 --> 20:01.909
That's my cue.

20:07.539 --> 20:08.874
Gladys Travelers, come on!

20:10.250 --> 20:13.086
-It's actually Gail Travers.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.130
-Gail.
-All right, Gail.

20:15.213 --> 20:16.590
What song is it gonna be?

20:16.673 --> 20:18.091
Um...

20:18.175 --> 20:20.594
Anyone wanna throw in
a little extra for a shuffle?

20:21.553 --> 20:23.972
Did... Did she say "shuffle"?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.933
Shuffle? Yeah?

20:26.016 --> 20:27.809
Looks like we got a shuffle.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.561
All right, get
your last-minute money in

20:29.645 --> 20:31.146
and let's spin the dial!

20:32.439 --> 20:35.025
Ooh, this is an oldie
but goodie.

20:35.108 --> 20:36.818
"Wayfaring Stranger."

20:36.902 --> 20:39.029
I actually
know that one really well.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.656
If it's good enough
for Johnny Cash,

20:40.739 --> 20:42.115
it's good enough for me.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.533
Amen.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.910
You mind if I play it myself?

20:44.993 --> 20:46.161
Knock yourself out.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.259
Go, give it up
for Miss Gail!

22:26.678 --> 22:28.305
Get those votes in,

22:28.388 --> 22:32.017
so we can see who's gonna
take home the cash!

22:35.687 --> 22:37.564
Where did that come from?

22:37.647 --> 22:39.107
I just got lucky with the song.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.151
Where did you say
she came from again?

22:42.486 --> 22:44.446
Um, ah, she, uh...

22:44.529 --> 22:46.782
-Her car broke down
just outside of town.
-Oh.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.450
She missed, uh...
She missed Eddie by an inch.

22:48.533 --> 22:51.995
I swear that creature
has nine lives.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.873
How lucky are we?

22:54.956 --> 22:57.000
Where you headed?
Home for Christmas?

22:57.084 --> 22:58.418
Not quite.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.628
The votes are in,

22:59.711 --> 23:01.797
and the winner is...

23:01.880 --> 23:04.925
-newcomer, Gail Travels!

23:05.008 --> 23:07.260
Go, darlin'! Whoo!

23:07.344 --> 23:08.512
Travers.

23:08.595 --> 23:09.930
It's Travers. Thank you.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.140
-Congratulations!
-Thanks.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.142
Ah, here you go.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.311
Gotta be honest with you,
I never thought
I'd see that back.

23:16.394 --> 23:19.689
You know, actually,
take the whole thing.
Put it towards the repairs.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.900
Look at you, winning.

23:23.151 --> 23:25.487
You know what? I'm...

23:25.570 --> 23:29.449
I'm actually gonna get going.
It's been a really long day.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.369
Bye.

23:35.413 --> 23:38.333
She's a little stuck-up,
isn't she?

23:41.002 --> 23:42.420
Where are you going?

23:44.589 --> 23:46.258
She's got nowhere to go.

23:47.551 --> 23:48.635
So?

23:57.435 --> 23:58.687
Hey.

23:58.770 --> 23:59.771
Where ya headed?

24:00.605 --> 24:01.648
Home.

24:01.731 --> 24:02.816
What, to that old bus?

24:02.899 --> 24:05.861
Yes, that old bus.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.280
Well, you know the shop
doors are locked, right?

24:08.363 --> 24:09.698
Oh.

24:09.781 --> 24:12.576
If only I knew someone
with the keys.

24:13.451 --> 24:14.953
Come on. I'll drive you.

24:15.036 --> 24:17.038
Your girlfriend gonna
come after me for this?

24:17.122 --> 24:18.874
Nah, I ain't got a girlfriend.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.711
Come on. It's freezing.

25:02.792 --> 25:04.711
Original song, huh?

25:06.379 --> 25:07.505
About what?

25:38.912 --> 25:39.913
No.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.583
-No, no, no.

26:26.793 --> 26:28.586
Really?

26:29.963 --> 26:31.673
God! What?

26:31.756 --> 26:33.883
You let her sleep in the bus?

26:33.967 --> 26:36.386
Well, you know, she was pretty
insistent about it, Mom.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.472
Here.

26:40.098 --> 26:41.224
Thanks.

26:41.308 --> 26:42.392
Yeah.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.311
Okay.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.689
This has a license plate,

26:47.772 --> 26:49.316
not a street address, okay?

26:49.399 --> 26:52.068
No more sleeping in a vehicle
that is under maintenance.

26:52.152 --> 26:54.279
Insurance won't cover it.

26:57.032 --> 27:00.869
Sorry about that.
Here. Take this.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.079
And you just, I don't know,
add it to your collection.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.497
Thanks.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.797
Sheriff?

27:12.881 --> 27:15.300
Yeah. Sheriff Jeffrey's out of
town for the next two weeks...

27:15.383 --> 27:16.885
a little hunting trip,

27:16.968 --> 27:18.219
so a man's gotta
wear a lot of hats.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.555
Hmm. Oh, you mean jackets?

27:22.515 --> 27:24.893
-Look, I got a plan.
-Well, here's my plan.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.644
Uh, you know what,
you go first.

27:26.728 --> 27:29.147
-Tell me your plan.
-I get a job
while you fix the bus.

27:29.230 --> 27:31.608
When you're done, I'll have
two grand and be on my way.

27:31.691 --> 27:33.777
So, what do you got in a town
like this? Diner?

27:33.860 --> 27:34.861
Post office?

27:34.944 --> 27:36.446
Phone operators?

27:36.529 --> 27:39.824
You know that minimum wage
around here is $7.25 an hour?

27:39.908 --> 27:44.412
That's gonna be
probably around 300 hours
over the next two weeks.

27:44.496 --> 27:47.749
Okay. So,
what's your awesome plan then?

27:54.339 --> 27:55.548
Very festive.

27:58.426 --> 27:59.844
A middle school?

27:59.928 --> 28:02.597
What, am I dealing pot?

28:02.680 --> 28:04.891
What kind of middle school
did you go to?

28:08.645 --> 28:10.939
It smells like sneakers
and fruit snacks.

28:11.022 --> 28:14.150
You better start talking. Oh!

28:14.234 --> 28:16.444
Jeremy,
where have you been?

28:16.528 --> 28:18.279
The twins, they're recruiting

28:18.363 --> 28:20.281
for their new rap song
music video.

28:20.365 --> 28:21.741
Sarah, slow down.

28:21.825 --> 28:23.576
And since when are there
oboe players in a rap song?

28:23.660 --> 28:25.620
-And then...
And then they were--
-Hey.

28:25.703 --> 28:27.288
-Why were they...
No, but they were--
-Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa.

28:27.372 --> 28:30.125
Look at me. Look at me.
My eyes. My eyes, okay?

28:30.208 --> 28:31.876
-Okay? Good.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.088
Do as I do. Follow me.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.102
Better?

28:51.104 --> 28:52.647
Oh!

28:52.730 --> 28:54.274
Are you the new music teacher?

28:54.357 --> 28:55.525
-No.
-Yeah.

28:57.068 --> 28:57.986
What?

29:16.588 --> 29:19.966
I'd like you to meet
our new music teacher, Miss...

29:20.049 --> 29:22.343
I think you are all mistaken.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.679
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Principal Crosby.

29:24.762 --> 29:27.515
Heard of your performance
last night at Gus's Bar.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.517
Seems you're qualified
for the job.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.395
Jeremy here will be
more than willing to step down.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.063
Am I right?

29:34.147 --> 29:36.232
You didn't think I came up with
this out of thin air, did you?

29:36.316 --> 29:39.360
I've been trying to teach these
kids for the last two weeks.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.696
I can't imagine
how that's going.

29:41.779 --> 29:43.114
What happened
to the last teacher?

29:43.198 --> 29:45.408
Teachers.
Everyone in town's tried.

29:45.492 --> 29:48.369
Jeremy was our last resort.

29:48.453 --> 29:51.456
Look, the performance for the
Christmas Gala is in two weeks.

29:51.539 --> 29:54.876
And this is a jacket
that I'd happily hand over.

29:54.959 --> 29:58.213
Does it look like I know
the first thing about
Christmas? Or galas?

29:58.296 --> 30:00.465
Jeremy has informed me
of your situation.

30:00.548 --> 30:02.133
You prep these kids

30:02.217 --> 30:03.885
and I'll cover the bus repairs.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.303
And if the kids win,

30:05.386 --> 30:07.222
perhaps you will leave
Harmony Springs

30:07.305 --> 30:09.390
with three percent
of the cash prize.

30:09.474 --> 30:10.850
You can win a gala?

30:10.934 --> 30:12.936
Each school selects
teams to compete.

30:13.019 --> 30:15.522
There's cash prizes, prestige.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.107
Do we have a deal?

30:20.818 --> 30:22.362
All expenses paid,

30:22.445 --> 30:24.239
that engine purrs
like a kitten,

30:24.322 --> 30:27.075
and I make it to LA on time.

30:27.158 --> 30:28.451
Yes, yes, and yes.

30:33.331 --> 30:34.999
Well, let's meet these kids.

30:35.833 --> 30:38.002
Thank you.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.712
Write your name
on the chalk board.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.839
I'm going to give you apples
every day.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.509
If teachers were apples,
I'd pick you.

30:45.426 --> 30:47.512
Jeremy. A word.

30:47.595 --> 30:50.890
After the gala, we have
to shut the music program down.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.017
What the hell are you
talking about, Stanley?

30:54.352 --> 30:55.478
I'm sorry, son.

30:57.021 --> 30:59.148
We just simply can't
keep the program going.

30:59.232 --> 31:02.819
So, uh, you're just gonna
do this without talkin'
to my family first?

31:03.736 --> 31:04.737
Or me?

31:05.446 --> 31:06.656
I'm sorry.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.247
Chalk board.

31:28.219 --> 31:31.514
My name is Ms. Travers,

31:31.598 --> 31:33.850
and I'm gonna be
helping you get ready

31:33.933 --> 31:37.562
for the Christmas Eve Gala
in two weeks.

31:37.645 --> 31:40.815
So, let's see what
we're workin' with here.

31:40.898 --> 31:42.483
Let's go around the room

31:42.567 --> 31:44.110
and tell me your name...

31:44.193 --> 31:47.196
Name, musical interest, and
favorite Christmas tradition.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.198
I'll start. I'm Sarah Hughes.

31:49.282 --> 31:51.034
I wanna be an opera singer.

31:51.117 --> 31:54.537
I like leaving food out
for Santa's reindeer
on Christmas Eve.

31:54.621 --> 31:57.290
Sarah. Opera. Reindeer. Noted.

31:57.373 --> 31:58.416
You and you.

31:58.499 --> 32:00.209
We're Jeff and Johnny.
I'm Jeff.

32:00.293 --> 32:01.836
I'm Johnny.

32:01.919 --> 32:05.632
We rap. Hoping to one day rock
Harmony Springs with our flow.

32:17.644 --> 32:19.228
Nice.

32:19.312 --> 32:20.897
And we set traps in our chimney
to see if we can catch a Santa.

32:20.980 --> 32:23.024
-Oh.
-We've never caught one.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.817
-Oh, no.
-Dear God.

32:24.901 --> 32:26.319
There's only one Santa

32:26.402 --> 32:28.863
and Santa doesn't actually
rhyme with Montana.

32:28.946 --> 32:30.406
Just to let you know.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.033
Benjamin still wets the bed.

32:32.116 --> 32:34.744
Hey. Okay, okay, no making fun
of one another, okay?

32:34.827 --> 32:36.579
That's rule number one.

32:36.663 --> 32:38.414
We have to support each other.

32:40.124 --> 32:41.167
Your turn.

32:41.250 --> 32:42.710
I'm Benjamin Donovan.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.545
I like to wear matching pj's
with my mom and dad...

32:44.629 --> 32:46.547
while we decorate the Christmas
tree, and I can play the oboe.

32:47.131 --> 32:48.966
Sort of.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.594
Do you all have to play
instruments for this thing?

32:51.678 --> 32:53.137
We don't have to.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.348
Okay, good. 'Cause I'm not
a real music teacher.

32:55.431 --> 32:58.393
Mm, we're not really
music students.

32:58.476 --> 33:01.354
So, what are your
musical skills then?

33:01.437 --> 33:04.565
And your favorite
Christmas tradition.

33:04.649 --> 33:08.361
Well, uh, I don't have
any Christmas traditions.

33:08.444 --> 33:10.154
Why not?

33:10.238 --> 33:14.534
I guess I never stuck around
long enough in one place
to make one.

33:14.617 --> 33:15.702
Why not?

33:18.788 --> 33:19.997
Long story.

33:20.081 --> 33:23.376
How about I show you
my musical skills?

33:51.195 --> 33:52.363
Wow.

33:52.447 --> 33:56.284
If we sing like that,
we'll win.

33:58.035 --> 33:59.454
-See ya.
-See ya.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.831
-Bye.
-Bye.

34:01.914 --> 34:03.291
She's so good.

34:03.374 --> 34:05.835
-I know, right?
-She's great!

34:16.721 --> 34:17.972
Ooh!

34:18.056 --> 34:20.224
Were you hiding back there
the whole time?

34:20.308 --> 34:24.812
Sorry. I'm scared of strangers
and loud noises.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.939
But you have a great voice.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.485
Thank you. What's your name?

34:32.236 --> 34:33.821
Rosemary.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.740
Nice to meet you, Rosemary.

34:37.366 --> 34:38.868
I sing to my animals.

34:39.535 --> 34:40.995
That's my skill,

34:41.078 --> 34:44.624
but my mom thinks
I need to be around
more humans.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.002
Yeah, humans.

34:48.085 --> 34:50.379
Well, I'm very excited
to hear you sing.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.844
Did you sing in all the places?

34:57.428 --> 34:59.138
What?

34:59.222 --> 35:01.015
All the places
you never stuck around

35:01.098 --> 35:03.142
long enough to make traditions.

35:04.602 --> 35:05.603
I did.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.607
Maybe that's your
Christmas tradition.

35:09.690 --> 35:10.858
Singing.

35:12.109 --> 35:15.988
Everyone has one,
even if they don't know it.

35:28.167 --> 35:29.710
One day.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.338
Hey, Mom. Dad.

35:32.421 --> 35:35.383
Hey, buddy. I saw you got
the beams up. Looks great.

35:35.466 --> 35:37.510
-Oh, it's wonderful, Abe.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.971
Yeah, you can really see the
rooms starting to take shape.

35:40.054 --> 35:43.182
So, you know they're shutting
down the music program?

35:43.266 --> 35:46.519
Oh, honey. Yeah. Stanley
warned us it might happen.

35:46.602 --> 35:50.398
I just wanted to wait
until he was sure
before I said anything.

35:50.481 --> 35:52.108
This meant
everything to Parker.

35:52.191 --> 35:54.735
I know, but there were, like,
what, four kids in the class?

35:54.819 --> 35:56.529
-There's five.
-Five.

35:57.738 --> 35:59.866
Five is not enough
to justify the cost.

35:59.949 --> 36:02.076
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry, son.

36:02.159 --> 36:04.412
But how did Gail do?

36:04.495 --> 36:06.747
She's got a way of
making things better, I guess.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.083
What's this now?

36:09.166 --> 36:12.295
Jeremy got the girl
with the bus to teach the kids.

36:12.378 --> 36:14.255
-Is that right?
-Mm-hmm.

36:14.338 --> 36:15.423
Gail, huh?

36:15.506 --> 36:16.757
Like the wind.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.677
Gail this, Gail that.

36:19.760 --> 36:21.512
She's been here
all of 12 hours.

36:21.596 --> 36:23.764
Can y'all talk about
anything else?

36:23.848 --> 36:25.474
Hey there, Scarlet.

36:27.393 --> 36:29.353
How's the build comin'?

36:29.437 --> 36:30.646
It's fine.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.610
Uh, we were...
We were just discussing that.

36:35.693 --> 36:38.321
We were talking about
how well it's coming along...

36:38.404 --> 36:40.823
-and what a great view.
-Yeah. Yeah.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.408
That's great, Van.

36:43.576 --> 36:44.619
Blueberry peach.

36:44.702 --> 36:46.704
Just how you guys like it.

36:46.787 --> 36:48.289
Thank you, Scarlet.

36:49.165 --> 36:50.666
Thank you, Scarlet.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.477
Livin' the dream.

37:23.282 --> 37:25.159
Wow.

37:25.242 --> 37:28.829
Thought I'd sneak by and get
away with spending a few more
nights in there.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.331
-Guess not.
-Mm-mm.

37:30.414 --> 37:31.874
What are you doing
with my stuff?

37:31.958 --> 37:33.417
Uh, I just put it in the box.

37:33.501 --> 37:35.544
You can't stay in there
no more, unfortunately,

37:35.628 --> 37:40.091
but my parents, they own
a studio a couple blocks away.
You could stay there.

37:40.174 --> 37:42.843
I mean, there's a bunch
of stuff layin' around.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.845
Haven't had time
to fix it up to rent it out,

37:44.929 --> 37:47.515
but it's got four walls
and a roof.

37:48.933 --> 37:52.019
Ah... You'll be okay, old girl.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.854
She better be in good hands.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.064
She's in great hands.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.777
My bus, I call her Jewel.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.030
She's the only home
I've ever known.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.158
Well, she is a gem.

38:06.242 --> 38:08.286
I'm glad someone
agrees with me.

38:11.288 --> 38:12.373
What happened?

38:12.456 --> 38:13.874
Splinter.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.876
My tip box, it...

38:15.960 --> 38:17.628
-Yeah.
-Tip box?

38:18.838 --> 38:21.590
Someone really special
gave it to me.

38:21.674 --> 38:23.509
I take it to all my gigs,

38:23.592 --> 38:25.761
but it broke in the crash.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.015
Sorry.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.979
Speakin' of sorries,
I owe you one.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.774
I was pretty mean the other day
when you came in there.

38:38.858 --> 38:42.653
Any mention of big cities
makes my skin crawl.

38:44.655 --> 38:46.073
So, sorry.

38:47.575 --> 38:49.660
Apology accepted.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.287
You weren't that bad.

38:51.370 --> 38:53.080
I was pretty bad.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.874
So, let me make it up to ya.

38:54.957 --> 38:58.127
Take you to dinner now,
and go look
at the studio later?

38:59.837 --> 39:02.673
You know a way
to a girl's heart.
I'm starving.

39:10.306 --> 39:11.932
Smells good.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.143
Okay.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.523
Oh!

39:19.607 --> 39:20.858
Of course.

39:20.941 --> 39:22.443
It's you! Well...

39:22.526 --> 39:25.196
Okay, my sons
Johnny and Jeff...

39:25.279 --> 39:27.990
they told me all about
their new music teacher.

39:28.074 --> 39:29.617
They said,
"She's not a real teacher,

39:29.700 --> 39:31.744
but she can sing and play piano
just like Beyonce."

39:31.827 --> 39:34.121
And I said,
"Does Beyonce play piano?"

39:34.205 --> 39:37.083
And they said,
"If she did, she'd play just
like Miss Gail."

39:37.166 --> 39:38.709
And then I said to myself,

39:38.793 --> 39:42.046
"How do I know that name?
Why do I know that name?"

39:42.129 --> 39:44.215
And now I get it.

39:44.298 --> 39:46.300
Let me get you a table.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.260
Bruce! Get the sauce
by the door.

39:48.344 --> 39:50.346
Come on, honey.
This way, we're goin' right
to this table right here.

39:50.429 --> 39:51.806
Hey. Did you hear
she almost hit Eddie?

39:51.889 --> 39:52.973
What? Eddie?

39:53.057 --> 39:54.892
-No!
-Yeah, right here.

39:54.975 --> 39:56.560
You happened to Eddie?

39:56.644 --> 39:59.230
-Guilty. Guilty.
-No. It's okay, darlin'.

39:59.313 --> 40:02.650
Listen, that alpaca
is like half deer. I swear.

40:02.733 --> 40:04.860
Something comes at it,
it just like...

40:09.782 --> 40:11.325
Deer in headlights.

40:14.745 --> 40:17.998
-Whoo!

40:18.082 --> 40:19.500
I'm just messing with you,
darlin'.

40:19.583 --> 40:20.918
Wow.

40:21.001 --> 40:23.504
So, where you headin'
once your bus is done?

40:23.587 --> 40:26.674
-I have a gig in LA.
-Oh!

40:26.757 --> 40:29.969
And if it all goes well,
I'll tour all over the world.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.347
She'd be on her way
to being a big deal.

40:33.431 --> 40:37.017
Well, that's a huge deal.
With who?

40:37.101 --> 40:39.311
They'll pair us
with the right fit, you know.

40:39.395 --> 40:41.021
It's a good thing
I'm used to living on the road.

40:41.105 --> 40:44.442
Well, listen. I am gonna
get you the Lumberjack platter.

40:44.525 --> 40:45.901
You know, just a little bit
of everything.

40:45.985 --> 40:48.195
No, no, no.
Come on now, that feeds six.

40:48.279 --> 40:51.240
You can take some home.

40:51.323 --> 40:53.784
Lumberjack platter?
What is that?

40:53.868 --> 40:55.578
It's just a whole lot of food.

40:55.661 --> 40:57.746
Plus, it'll make a great photo
for your Instagram.

40:57.830 --> 40:59.748
I'm surprised
you even know what that is.

40:59.832 --> 41:01.625
I ain't livin' in a hole here.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.836
I gave it up.

41:03.919 --> 41:05.838
I gave up all my social media.

41:05.921 --> 41:07.464
Color me intrigued.

41:07.548 --> 41:09.508
Sometimes when things aren't
working, you unplug for a bit

41:09.592 --> 41:11.385
-before you plug back in.
-Hmm.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.721
Life's no different.

41:13.804 --> 41:17.433
I haven't been this unplugged
since I was eight.

41:18.392 --> 41:19.935
Well, here we go.

41:20.019 --> 41:22.980
-Oh, boy.
-Two Oklahoma
extra oma palomas.

41:23.063 --> 41:25.983
Now, you tell your friends
in LA about that.

41:26.066 --> 41:27.151
Wow.

41:31.447 --> 41:32.907
To LA.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.909
Oh, so now
you're pro big cities?

41:34.992 --> 41:37.411
Can't make it big
without a big city, right?

41:38.954 --> 41:40.164
Cheers.

41:40.247 --> 41:41.373
Cheers.

41:42.124 --> 41:43.250
Thanks.

41:55.888 --> 41:57.556
So, just so you know,
I wasn't lying.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.558
-It's pretty messy in here.

42:03.479 --> 42:05.689
Now, I know it's not much,

42:06.774 --> 42:08.275
but it's warm.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.861
And bathroom's
back there, so...

42:10.945 --> 42:14.615
If Rachael's barbeque wasn't
so good, I'd be outta here.

42:14.698 --> 42:18.535
Um, I know there's
some fresh sheets
in one of these boxes...

42:18.619 --> 42:19.954
No, no, no. Not this one.

42:23.082 --> 42:24.917
-This one?
-Yeah, I believe so.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.418
I mean,
I know there used to be.

42:28.504 --> 42:30.506
Here you go. Oh.

42:34.885 --> 42:36.178
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

42:36.262 --> 42:37.471
Uh...

42:37.554 --> 42:38.806
Forgot to ask you,

42:38.889 --> 42:41.392
uh, what song
were you teaching the kids?

42:42.476 --> 42:44.228
Uh, never got that far.

42:44.311 --> 42:46.689
This being our last song,
I don't know,
pick something special.

42:47.690 --> 42:48.816
Hmm.

42:48.899 --> 42:51.360
Sounds like you miss it.

42:51.443 --> 42:53.904
Kinda.
Even if the kids are awful.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.990
Hey. They are not awful.

42:56.073 --> 42:57.283
They're just...

42:58.033 --> 42:59.201
unpolished.

43:01.328 --> 43:04.999
Well, uh, the kids...

43:05.082 --> 43:06.250
they're the heart of this town.

43:06.333 --> 43:08.210
And the word is they
really love you.

43:09.753 --> 43:12.840
That reminds me, um,
Stanley called,

43:12.923 --> 43:16.218
so I guess your class
starts at 8:00 a.m.

43:16.302 --> 43:17.970
I thought this was
an after-school thing?

43:18.053 --> 43:21.181
Mm-mm. Christmas break.
Next two weeks.

43:21.265 --> 43:23.642
-So, good luck.
-Hmm...

43:28.939 --> 43:30.774
8:00 a.m.

43:30.858 --> 43:33.027
When am I gonna write my song?

43:35.070 --> 43:38.240
Miss Travers? Ew!

43:38.324 --> 43:42.161
Uh, sorry. I'm just bringin' in
the rest of your stuff.

43:44.246 --> 43:45.456
This, uh...

43:45.539 --> 43:46.832
This good here?

43:48.250 --> 43:50.753
-Great.
-Cool. Um...

43:50.836 --> 43:52.755
Yeah. Good night.

43:52.838 --> 43:53.881
Good night.

44:10.189 --> 44:12.316
Something smells really good.

44:19.990 --> 44:22.993
-Well, good mornin'.
-Good mornin'.

44:23.077 --> 44:25.412
About time y'all woke up.

44:25.496 --> 44:27.623
-What do we have here?
-It smells so good.

44:27.706 --> 44:29.750
I know. I was trying
to be quiet.

44:31.668 --> 44:34.338
-Look at that.
-Wow.

44:35.005 --> 44:36.256
Whoa.

44:36.340 --> 44:39.093
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

44:39.176 --> 44:42.805
Are these your famous
Jeremy flapjacks?

44:42.888 --> 44:44.640
Yes, they are.

44:44.723 --> 44:46.016
-Boy.
-Here you go, Mom.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.268
'Cause you know
first one's always yours.

44:48.352 --> 44:49.770
I have missed this.

44:49.853 --> 44:51.313
Thank you.

44:52.022 --> 44:53.357
Look at him.

45:11.208 --> 45:13.127
-Ooh.

45:13.210 --> 45:15.546
Everything okay?

45:15.629 --> 45:18.966
Uh, I have to write
my very own song.

45:19.049 --> 45:23.262
A song good enough to impress
some of the best music people
out there.

45:23.345 --> 45:24.346
So,

45:24.430 --> 45:26.515
it has to be perfect.

45:26.598 --> 45:29.184
The animals on our farm
are messy.

45:29.268 --> 45:33.564
Pretty imperfect, but I still
think they're beautiful.

45:33.647 --> 45:37.609
Cracks happen in our lives just
to let the light in. You know?

45:39.653 --> 45:41.155
You give the best advice.

45:43.157 --> 45:48.620
What would you say to someone
who has a beautiful voice,

45:48.704 --> 45:51.373
but they're scared
of showing it off?

45:53.083 --> 45:54.668
I'm getting
the first cubbyhole.

45:54.751 --> 45:58.338
The first book... Yeah, I know,
but I just don't like...

45:58.422 --> 45:59.756
It's time to get focused.

45:59.840 --> 46:01.633
Focusing.

46:01.717 --> 46:06.346
Today we're gonna focus
on the instrument
we already have. Our voice.

46:06.430 --> 46:07.473
All right?

46:07.556 --> 46:09.933
Everyone, get up.
Stand up. Get up.

46:10.017 --> 46:13.770
Close your eyes.
Close 'em. Close 'em.

46:13.854 --> 46:17.107
Now, place your hands
over your heart.

46:18.108 --> 46:19.401
Breathe in.

46:20.652 --> 46:21.612
Breathe out.

46:24.281 --> 46:26.408
This is where you sing from.

46:26.492 --> 46:29.161
Not your head or your lungs.

46:29.244 --> 46:30.496
Your heart.

46:31.580 --> 46:33.373
Now, set an intention.

46:33.457 --> 46:35.751
How do you wanna
feel when you sing?

46:35.834 --> 46:38.921
Now, stretch your arms
out in front of you...

46:39.004 --> 46:41.173
and release it out
into the universe.

46:42.966 --> 46:44.176
I feel it.

46:44.259 --> 46:47.471
Someone's intention
smells like a fart.

46:47.554 --> 46:50.140
Release your intentions
through your mouths.

46:50.224 --> 46:51.266
Not our butts?

46:51.350 --> 46:53.519
Come on. Keep your focus!

46:53.602 --> 46:54.978
Thank you, Sarah.

46:55.062 --> 46:58.899
Okay, today we're gonna try
singing a simple A note.

46:58.982 --> 47:02.110
One at a time.
Just like this, okay?

47:12.454 --> 47:13.747
That was great.

47:13.830 --> 47:15.707
All right.

47:15.791 --> 47:19.670
Believe it or not,
an A can sound different
for someone with a lower voice.

47:19.753 --> 47:21.004
Like Benjamin.

47:21.088 --> 47:23.549
Johnny and Jeff, your turn.
Let's hear it.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.138
Okay.

47:30.222 --> 47:32.849
Playing to your strengths.
I love it. Love it.

47:32.933 --> 47:34.601
Rosemary, your turn.

47:34.685 --> 47:36.103
Just an A note.

47:36.186 --> 47:37.479
Easy-peasy.

47:39.773 --> 47:42.150
Mm-hmm. Okay,
I think I can hear it.

47:42.234 --> 47:44.820
You just need to get
a little louder.

47:50.409 --> 47:52.119
That was beautiful.

47:52.202 --> 47:54.288
You just gotta
get it a little louder.

47:54.371 --> 47:56.665
Don't worry. You're not gonna
scare anyone away.

47:58.375 --> 48:00.377
All right, Miss Opera singer,
let's hear it.

48:09.052 --> 48:10.262
Wow. Wow.

48:10.345 --> 48:12.347
Okay. Okay. Shh, shh.

48:12.431 --> 48:14.975
We are gonna work on that.

48:15.058 --> 48:17.728
All right, I have to write
my very own song

48:17.811 --> 48:19.646
for a big show I have coming up

48:19.730 --> 48:21.398
and I'm having a hard time.

48:21.481 --> 48:26.028
What if we all write
a Christmas song together
for the gala?

48:26.111 --> 48:27.321
I could use the practice.

48:27.404 --> 48:30.115
Do we have
enough time for that?

48:30.198 --> 48:33.160
Well, it doesn't have
to be perfect.

48:33.243 --> 48:35.412
-It just has to be ours.

48:35.495 --> 48:36.622
-See ya.
-Bye.

48:37.581 --> 48:38.665
Great job today.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.375
-Bye.
-Bye.

48:40.459 --> 48:41.918
Hey, Sarah.

48:42.002 --> 48:43.045
Everything okay?

48:44.630 --> 48:46.465
I know I can't sing.

48:47.299 --> 48:48.550
I've been trying

48:48.634 --> 48:51.345
and I know I act like I'm good

48:51.428 --> 48:54.765
but it's just pretend
and I'm not good
at anything at all.

48:54.848 --> 48:55.849
Hey.

48:55.932 --> 48:57.517
Sarah, that's not true.

48:57.601 --> 48:59.936
I bet you're good
at a lot of things.

49:02.773 --> 49:06.860
You know what?
I'm gonna be gone for the show.

49:06.943 --> 49:10.322
I'm gonna need someone to be
in charge while I'm away.

49:10.405 --> 49:14.326
I think you would be
really good at that.

49:14.409 --> 49:15.369
At what?

49:15.452 --> 49:17.371
Making things happen.

49:17.454 --> 49:18.747
We need lights,

49:18.830 --> 49:21.333
stage direction,
every detail of the performance

49:21.416 --> 49:22.876
needs to be organized.

49:22.959 --> 49:24.795
That's what
a stage manager does.

49:24.878 --> 49:25.921
Stage manager?

49:26.004 --> 49:28.006
Mm-hmm. The best operas,

49:28.090 --> 49:31.843
they're run by
the best stage managers
in the world.

49:31.927 --> 49:33.971
We're gonna need
someone really good

49:34.054 --> 49:35.472
to be the boss.

49:38.475 --> 49:40.686
-Then call me "boss," boss.
-Give me some.

49:41.561 --> 49:42.979
-Bye.
-Bye.

49:46.608 --> 49:48.819
Oh.

49:48.902 --> 49:52.739
Well, I can see
why he likes you so much.

49:52.823 --> 49:53.824
Who?

49:53.907 --> 49:56.910
Oh, you know exactly who.

49:56.993 --> 49:58.578
What about Scarlet?

49:58.662 --> 50:01.415
Let's just say
it takes two to agree
to be a couple,

50:01.498 --> 50:02.749
not just one.

50:02.833 --> 50:04.418
Girl's been after him
since grade school.

50:04.501 --> 50:07.838
Oh! Oh, how much longer
do we have you?

50:07.921 --> 50:09.506
You know what?

50:09.589 --> 50:10.674
I don't wanna know.

50:10.757 --> 50:12.467
You want some cake?

50:12.551 --> 50:14.469
Bruce! Get the cake!

50:28.692 --> 50:29.651
Come in.

50:31.945 --> 50:33.572
-Hey.
-Hi.

50:33.655 --> 50:35.782
I, uh...

50:35.866 --> 50:37.451
You never came in
to check on Jewel today,

50:37.534 --> 50:39.453
so I just wanted to make sure
everything was okay.

50:39.536 --> 50:41.663
Mm-hmm, I'm working on
some lyrics.

50:41.747 --> 50:44.166
I have two songs to write now.

50:44.249 --> 50:46.835
Oh, you're...
You're doin' an original song.

50:46.918 --> 50:48.086
Mm-hmm.

50:48.170 --> 50:51.381
The, um, last teacher
we had do that...

50:52.883 --> 50:55.969
uh, kids really loved it, so...

50:58.388 --> 50:59.639
Um...

51:00.390 --> 51:01.349
Got you something.

51:01.433 --> 51:03.518
Ooh.

51:03.602 --> 51:04.811
An empty box.

51:04.895 --> 51:06.021
It's a send-back box.

51:06.104 --> 51:08.690
You put your broken
phone inside

51:08.774 --> 51:11.443
and they you send it out
and they mail you
a brand-new one.

51:11.526 --> 51:13.987
Actually, you know what?
I can mail it out for you
tonight if you want.

51:14.070 --> 51:15.489
You got the phone?

51:15.572 --> 51:16.990
You know, I don't even know

51:17.073 --> 51:20.494
where my phone is right now,
if you can believe that.

51:20.577 --> 51:22.412
Oh, here it is.

51:23.121 --> 51:24.289
Perfect.

51:29.211 --> 51:30.921
I'll let you get back to it.

51:31.004 --> 51:33.006
Yeah. Um...

51:33.089 --> 51:37.511
You know, actually
if you get a break
or something,

51:37.594 --> 51:39.012
you know,
later on if you're hungry,

51:39.096 --> 51:40.680
I know a great place
for dinner.

51:40.764 --> 51:44.768
Yes. Yes, I could eat that
barbeque sandwich every meal.

51:44.851 --> 51:47.813
No, I was actually thinking
of something a little more
close to home.

51:48.939 --> 51:50.065
Hmm.

51:51.066 --> 51:52.067
Okay.

51:53.485 --> 51:55.111
Cool.

51:55.195 --> 51:56.780
I'll, uh, see you later.

51:56.863 --> 51:57.864
See you later.

52:09.042 --> 52:12.128
This was so good.

52:12.212 --> 52:14.840
Girl could stick around
for this kinda cooking.

52:17.342 --> 52:19.803
So, you live here?

52:19.886 --> 52:24.057
For now. It's just easier
while I build it
for my parents.

52:24.140 --> 52:27.727
This could be
the sweetest thing
you could do for someone.

52:27.811 --> 52:33.066
These walls you've created
will hold your family's
most precious moments.

52:35.485 --> 52:38.613
Never really thought
about it like that.

52:38.697 --> 52:40.574
You should tell me
about your family.

52:43.702 --> 52:44.953
I, uh...

52:47.330 --> 52:49.332
I never knew my parents.

52:51.001 --> 52:53.003
I never had a house.

52:53.086 --> 52:54.796
I was a foster kid.

52:56.214 --> 53:00.719
I grew up in the system
from the day I was born.

53:00.802 --> 53:03.638
Run of bad luck got me
bounced around several times

53:03.722 --> 53:05.765
until I hit 18.

53:07.017 --> 53:09.936
I had my guitar, my music...

53:10.729 --> 53:12.188
that was my home.

53:13.607 --> 53:14.941
Sorry.

53:15.025 --> 53:17.068
It wasn't all that bad.

53:17.152 --> 53:19.613
I had this one foster dad

53:19.696 --> 53:22.115
who taught me
how to ground myself

53:22.198 --> 53:24.618
before I sing, you know.

53:24.701 --> 53:27.412
Use the nervous butterflies
to find my voice.

53:29.873 --> 53:32.125
Did he create the tip box?

53:32.208 --> 53:34.794
-Yes, he did.
-Figured.

53:34.878 --> 53:36.588
Where is he?

53:36.671 --> 53:38.423
He moved to Canada...

53:39.841 --> 53:43.595
without me, um,
for a business opportunity.

53:45.096 --> 53:47.223
Foster kids
can't leave the country,

53:48.099 --> 53:49.809
and we lost touch.

53:51.895 --> 53:53.813
That's the system for you.

53:55.231 --> 53:57.400
But what about you?

53:57.484 --> 54:00.070
Childhood out here
must've been pretty great.

54:00.737 --> 54:01.780
Yeah.

54:03.281 --> 54:04.741
I mean, look.

54:04.824 --> 54:06.534
Yeah, we had the biggest house
up on a hill, you know.

54:06.618 --> 54:09.621
Nothing but green for miles.
It was great.

54:12.248 --> 54:13.833
But we couldn't stay.

54:16.252 --> 54:17.671
Not after my brother died.

54:21.174 --> 54:25.512
But this, it's the least I can
do for taking him away.

54:28.390 --> 54:30.392
Taking him away?

54:30.475 --> 54:32.602
He was the star
of the music program.

54:33.937 --> 54:37.899
Yeah. I mean,
he actually started it.

54:37.983 --> 54:40.485
His voice was so good, Gail.

54:40.568 --> 54:41.695
Like yours.

54:44.155 --> 54:46.992
You know, which is why
I pushed him so hard.

54:48.660 --> 54:50.996
I had this plan.

54:51.079 --> 54:55.208
You know, go out to LA
so he can chase his dream.

54:55.291 --> 54:57.711
I mean, I just got
so caught up in it all.

54:57.794 --> 54:59.671
Became so self-centered.

55:00.630 --> 55:02.048
And what happened?

55:02.132 --> 55:03.675
We were at a party...

55:05.176 --> 55:08.054
and it was getting late.

55:08.138 --> 55:09.889
He had a gig
the next day, early,

55:09.973 --> 55:11.766
and he was exhausted,

55:11.850 --> 55:14.811
so I just threw him the keys.

55:19.399 --> 55:20.442
And, uh, he...

55:22.027 --> 55:24.654
probably fell asleep
at the wheel.

55:24.738 --> 55:27.157
Hit a curb, lost control,
and that was it.

55:28.158 --> 55:29.993
Last time I saw my brother.

55:31.661 --> 55:33.329
I'm so sorry, Jeremy.

55:35.999 --> 55:37.625
So, you went home,

55:38.668 --> 55:41.254
and put on all your jackets?

55:41.337 --> 55:46.009
What I'm doing is trying
to fill the hole
that he left behind.

55:46.092 --> 55:47.886
Parker was everything
to Harmony Springs.

55:47.969 --> 55:49.721
Well, you can't blame yourself.

55:51.639 --> 55:55.060
The reason why I stayed
is because Coldplay
was gonna be there.

55:58.021 --> 56:00.148
And I just wanted
to take a picture with them

56:00.231 --> 56:02.942
to impress some girl
that I didn't even know.

56:05.779 --> 56:07.280
Because of it,

56:07.363 --> 56:09.866
we never got to see my brother
again over some stupid post.

56:12.952 --> 56:14.871
Yeah, now, um...

56:16.206 --> 56:17.916
Now, I get
the whole smartphone thing.

56:19.042 --> 56:20.168
Hmmm.

56:20.251 --> 56:22.253
I know what
you must think of me.

56:23.755 --> 56:26.633
Desperate to update my story

56:26.716 --> 56:29.844
for a whole bunch of people
I've never even met.

56:29.928 --> 56:31.304
No.

56:31.387 --> 56:34.891
I mean, it's a priority
for your career. I get it.

56:35.600 --> 56:37.185
Hmm.

56:37.268 --> 56:39.020
I'll tell you what, though.

56:41.272 --> 56:43.858
I like the unplugged Gail
a whole lot better.

56:47.070 --> 56:48.363
I do, too.

57:00.875 --> 57:02.794
-Did he kiss her yet?
-I don't know.

57:04.420 --> 57:06.339
Are they 12 years old?

57:06.422 --> 57:08.299
This is too much.

57:08.383 --> 57:09.467
Oh, man.

57:10.760 --> 57:12.929
-Wanna look at the stars?
-Yeah.

59:00.453 --> 59:02.956
-You leave so soon.
-Yeah.

59:03.039 --> 59:04.666
How'd Rachael take it?

59:05.625 --> 59:06.960
Not so good.

59:07.043 --> 59:09.295
She's a crier.

59:09.379 --> 59:11.256
So, with this singing gig
you have,

59:11.339 --> 59:12.966
what happens after the show?

59:13.049 --> 59:14.801
Well, she's actually
gonna hit the road.

59:14.884 --> 59:16.344
She's gonna go on tour now.

59:16.427 --> 59:19.013
And yeah. She'll be on her way
to becoming a huge star.

59:19.097 --> 59:21.474
Making some albums
and all that jazz.

59:21.557 --> 59:23.476
-Wow.
-Hmm.

59:23.559 --> 59:24.769
Yeah.

59:24.852 --> 59:27.021
I spent my whole life
on the road, so...

59:27.981 --> 59:29.065
kinda used to it.

59:31.442 --> 59:33.486
So, who's gonna finish
getting the kids ready?

59:33.569 --> 59:35.446
He's sitting right next to me.

59:35.530 --> 59:37.115
-Oh.

59:37.198 --> 59:38.491
-Okay.
-Our son?

59:38.574 --> 59:40.451
Uh-uh. I do not think so.

59:40.535 --> 59:42.662
That boy cannot sing a lick.

59:42.745 --> 59:44.622
Don't worry. They're ready.

59:44.706 --> 59:47.709
You have to get them
on the stage, okay?

59:47.792 --> 59:49.419
Yeah. Gotcha.

59:50.837 --> 59:53.006
He'll do it.

59:53.089 --> 59:55.008
I'm gonna miss you all so much.

1:00:02.307 --> 1:00:05.476
I should get going. I have
a few more things to pack,

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:06.686
finish the song.

1:00:06.769 --> 1:00:08.271
I'll see you later, yeah?

1:00:08.354 --> 1:00:10.606
-Yeah, see you later.
-Okay.

1:00:12.066 --> 1:00:14.235
Here, no. I got it.
I'll get this.

1:00:15.486 --> 1:00:17.989
-First time in his life.
-Go.

1:00:18.072 --> 1:00:19.615
Go on now. Git!

1:00:19.699 --> 1:00:21.367
-Thank you for dinner.
It was delicious.
-Thank you.

1:00:21.451 --> 1:00:23.619
-You're welcome.
-So glad you could come.

1:00:48.644 --> 1:00:49.687
Yeah.

1:00:50.938 --> 1:00:52.190
This is Christmas.

1:00:52.273 --> 1:00:54.150
-Come in.

1:00:59.405 --> 1:01:01.074
I'm sorry.

1:01:01.157 --> 1:01:02.658
Am I interrupting something?

1:01:02.742 --> 1:01:05.912
I just wanted to make sure
I bid my farewell.

1:01:05.995 --> 1:01:07.830
What are you doing for Jer?

1:01:08.998 --> 1:01:10.666
What?

1:01:10.750 --> 1:01:14.379
You're not giving him
a thank you of any kind?

1:01:15.171 --> 1:01:16.589
He's the gesture type.

1:01:16.672 --> 1:01:19.384
I've been so busy,
I didn't even think about that.

1:01:19.467 --> 1:01:21.094
Mm-hmm.

1:01:21.177 --> 1:01:23.137
You live in your van, right?

1:01:23.221 --> 1:01:24.639
Mm-hmm.

1:01:24.722 --> 1:01:26.891
So you're good
with small spaces.

1:01:29.394 --> 1:01:31.521
Why don't I help you
set some of this stuff up?

1:01:35.650 --> 1:01:36.692
Oh, my gosh.

1:01:36.776 --> 1:01:38.277
Look.

1:01:38.361 --> 1:01:41.155
I remember this being
right about here.

1:01:42.073 --> 1:01:43.616
You sure he won't mind?

1:01:43.699 --> 1:01:47.453
Girl, he's been dying
to tidy up this space.
Trust me.

1:01:47.537 --> 1:01:49.372
He did say they
haven't had time--

1:01:49.455 --> 1:01:50.581
Exactly!

1:01:50.665 --> 1:01:53.084
It'll take less than
an hour. Come on.

1:01:55.461 --> 1:01:57.839
Oh, I just love this.

1:02:02.468 --> 1:02:03.678
Perfect.

1:02:11.352 --> 1:02:12.979
I love these movies.

1:02:13.062 --> 1:02:14.605
Don't you love these movies?

1:02:25.575 --> 1:02:26.784
Love you, Mom.

1:02:29.245 --> 1:02:30.663
I love you.

1:02:31.789 --> 1:02:32.832
Door's open.

1:02:34.750 --> 1:02:35.877
Hi.

1:02:36.502 --> 1:02:37.420
Thank you.

1:02:41.591 --> 1:02:43.259
What... What did you do?

1:02:43.342 --> 1:02:45.470
You said you hadn't
had time to fix it up

1:02:45.553 --> 1:02:46.846
so I put it all together.

1:02:48.681 --> 1:02:51.934
Why? Why...
Why would you do this?

1:02:52.018 --> 1:02:53.227
-I wanted to thank you.
-No.

1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:55.771
Make it look nice, I--

1:02:59.567 --> 1:03:01.527
-Jeremy!

1:03:10.912 --> 1:03:12.121
Van.

1:03:13.706 --> 1:03:15.458
-Is Jeremy here?
-Come on.

1:03:15.541 --> 1:03:17.084
-Come on in.
-I really messed up here.

1:03:17.168 --> 1:03:19.253
All right, breathe.
Breathe, okay?

1:03:19.337 --> 1:03:22.632
Breathe, okay?
Sit down. Sit down.

1:03:22.715 --> 1:03:26.469
Breathe. Breathe,
breathe. Okay.

1:03:26.552 --> 1:03:29.138
-Talk to me.
-Scarlet said it
would be a good idea.

1:03:29.222 --> 1:03:30.056
Scarlet?

1:03:31.933 --> 1:03:34.644
I bet you're giving
that girl a run for her money.

1:03:34.727 --> 1:03:37.230
She's been after Jeremy
since the day that she decided

1:03:37.313 --> 1:03:39.106
boys did not have cooties.

1:03:41.526 --> 1:03:43.236
What happened?

1:03:43.319 --> 1:03:46.739
We decided to fix up the studio
with a bunch of boxed up stuff.

1:03:46.822 --> 1:03:50.159
You know, I thought
it would be a nice thing to do
before I left.

1:03:50.243 --> 1:03:51.869
Parker's studio?

1:03:55.331 --> 1:03:57.625
I could never get him
out of that place.

1:03:58.793 --> 1:04:00.753
He was always
writing somethin'.

1:04:03.548 --> 1:04:06.717
That explains why I've had such
good luck with my songwriting.

1:04:08.010 --> 1:04:10.888
I've never felt so inspired.

1:04:10.972 --> 1:04:13.266
Maybe it's not just the studio.

1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:17.436
It must've been such a shock.

1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:19.814
You know, seeing the studio
the same way it was

1:04:19.897 --> 1:04:21.232
when Parker was alive.

1:04:21.315 --> 1:04:22.900
I should've known.

1:04:22.984 --> 1:04:25.611
There was all this music stuff
everywhere. I should've known.

1:04:25.695 --> 1:04:28.155
Honey, honey,
your intentions were good.

1:04:38.666 --> 1:04:40.668
Abe and I were...

1:04:42.878 --> 1:04:46.716
We were lucky
we had each other
when it happened.

1:04:48.384 --> 1:04:49.594
Jeremy...

1:04:50.428 --> 1:04:52.138
he just isolated.

1:04:52.221 --> 1:04:56.058
He just threw himself
into his work, you know,

1:04:56.142 --> 1:05:00.104
and he didn't give himself
time to process it and...

1:05:02.064 --> 1:05:06.360
They say that there's nothing
worse than losing a child,

1:05:08.446 --> 1:05:11.949
and I lost two that day.

1:05:14.327 --> 1:05:16.537
-Two.
-I'm sorry, Van.

1:05:16.621 --> 1:05:19.290
I'm so sorry.

1:05:19.373 --> 1:05:22.501
He's come up for air
for the first time in years.

1:05:22.585 --> 1:05:24.837
He's cooking again,

1:05:24.920 --> 1:05:29.050
and he's playing music
when he works.

1:05:30.426 --> 1:05:34.388
And there's a light
right back in his eyes.

1:05:36.849 --> 1:05:39.935
And the only thing
that has changed...

1:05:42.104 --> 1:05:44.774
is you being here.

1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:49.945
Okay? It's gonna be okay.

1:05:54.116 --> 1:05:55.785
I made you some tea.

1:05:57.620 --> 1:05:59.997
Come on, it's late.
Take a break.

1:06:14.303 --> 1:06:16.263
We all miss him, you know.

1:06:22.269 --> 1:06:23.312
Jeremy.

1:06:24.146 --> 1:06:25.147
Jeremy?

1:06:26.065 --> 1:06:27.400
Look at me.

1:06:30.945 --> 1:06:32.571
Son...

1:06:32.655 --> 1:06:36.242
you have been drowning
for so long

1:06:36.325 --> 1:06:39.036
that you don't even feel it

1:06:39.120 --> 1:06:43.499
when you pull the people
that are the closest to you
into the undertow.

1:06:45.543 --> 1:06:47.211
We all loved him.

1:06:48.671 --> 1:06:50.089
So much.

1:06:52.591 --> 1:06:56.011
But he would not want
to see you behaving this way.

1:07:02.143 --> 1:07:03.978
I shouldn't have
snapped at her.

1:07:07.398 --> 1:07:08.774
It happens.

1:07:10.526 --> 1:07:12.903
The question is,
what are you gonna do now?

1:08:02.703 --> 1:08:06.415
Hey, guys. It's Gail.
I'm still in Oklahoma.

1:08:06.499 --> 1:08:08.334
I've been, uh...

1:08:08.876 --> 1:08:10.503
I...

1:08:10.586 --> 1:08:14.215
I have nothing to say
to a faceless piece of glass.

1:08:25.810 --> 1:08:27.228
I know. I know. I'm late.

1:08:27.311 --> 1:08:29.021
iHeart Radio, they sent an--

1:08:31.941 --> 1:08:33.234
Sent an email.

1:08:33.317 --> 1:08:34.610
As stage manager,

1:08:34.693 --> 1:08:37.154
I hereby declare
the first quarter of this class

1:08:37.238 --> 1:08:38.531
dedicated to Jeremy Crawford

1:08:38.614 --> 1:08:41.575
and his heart-felt
sincerest apology.

1:08:41.659 --> 1:08:43.244
Hit it, Jeff.

1:08:53.587 --> 1:08:55.047
I'm sorry.

1:08:55.130 --> 1:08:56.131
Do you forgive him?

1:08:56.215 --> 1:08:58.259
Say yes.

1:08:58.342 --> 1:09:00.261
We wanted to give you
something special.

1:09:01.136 --> 1:09:02.471
To remember us by.

1:09:03.180 --> 1:09:04.515
Hope it fits.

1:09:05.307 --> 1:09:07.143
What is this?

1:09:07.226 --> 1:09:09.270
I sewed the snowman on myself.

1:09:11.397 --> 1:09:12.815
Your Christmas tradition.

1:09:13.816 --> 1:09:15.818
It's the same one.

1:09:21.657 --> 1:09:23.242
Thank you.

1:09:23.325 --> 1:09:25.703
Aw. Thank you, guys.

1:09:30.708 --> 1:09:35.004
Guys, this is amazing.
Thank you.

1:09:38.799 --> 1:09:40.426
My tip box.

1:09:40.509 --> 1:09:41.552
It may help.

1:09:43.554 --> 1:09:45.514
I'm sorry for how I reacted.

1:09:51.020 --> 1:09:52.479
Look at these.

1:10:01.197 --> 1:10:03.991
-Scarlet said that--
-You know what? Doesn't matter.

1:10:05.034 --> 1:10:06.619
You were right, I was wrong.

1:10:07.912 --> 1:10:09.622
Well, a girl loves
to hear that.

1:10:14.210 --> 1:10:16.378
Ooh!

1:10:17.296 --> 1:10:19.173
All right.

1:10:19.256 --> 1:10:23.427
Hey. This county doesn't know
what's coming for them.

1:10:23.510 --> 1:10:25.471
Okay?

1:10:25.554 --> 1:10:27.014
Whatever happens at the gala...

1:10:28.223 --> 1:10:30.309
just know you already won
in my eyes.

1:10:33.729 --> 1:10:34.813
Here.

1:10:34.897 --> 1:10:36.565
-Don't peek.
-Doing.

1:10:37.733 --> 1:10:38.901
Go ahead.

1:10:42.863 --> 1:10:44.281
Wow.

1:10:45.282 --> 1:10:47.284
She's beautiful.

1:10:47.368 --> 1:10:50.037
Yeah. Yes, she is.

1:10:53.123 --> 1:10:54.208
Here.

1:10:55.417 --> 1:10:57.044
Got something for ya.

1:10:57.127 --> 1:10:58.420
What job's this one from?

1:10:58.504 --> 1:11:00.839
Oh, no. This one's
actually mine.

1:11:00.923 --> 1:11:04.093
I was thinking you could hold
onto it for me for a while...

1:11:04.176 --> 1:11:05.719
and take it with you
on your travels.

1:11:08.973 --> 1:11:11.517
Uh, you said something in class
earlier about iHeart.

1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:16.522
Yes. They need a good recording
of my song, but I, uh...

1:11:16.605 --> 1:11:19.817
I don't have anyone
to help me record it.

1:11:19.900 --> 1:11:21.527
-Mm.

1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:02.443
Wow.

1:12:05.070 --> 1:12:06.864
Gail, that was, uh...

1:12:08.157 --> 1:12:11.160
That was beautiful.
It was really amazing.

1:12:13.037 --> 1:12:14.121
Thank you.

1:12:17.666 --> 1:12:19.126
Well,

1:12:19.209 --> 1:12:21.003
it sent, so...

1:12:21.670 --> 1:12:23.714
Thank you.

1:12:43.317 --> 1:12:45.778
I think it's time we take off
some jackets.

1:14:05.816 --> 1:14:06.859
Hey.

1:14:09.111 --> 1:14:10.195
Good mornin'.

1:14:10.279 --> 1:14:11.655
We need to talk.

1:14:30.632 --> 1:14:32.759
I'm sorry. I should've been
honest with you sooner.

1:14:32.843 --> 1:14:33.886
You should've.

1:14:36.180 --> 1:14:39.766
Look, I'm sorry I pushed you
so much, Jeremy. I just...

1:14:42.311 --> 1:14:44.021
I really thought
we'd end up together.

1:14:46.148 --> 1:14:47.316
Scarlet...

1:14:47.399 --> 1:14:49.568
we just weren't
right for each other.

1:14:50.694 --> 1:14:52.654
I'm sorry.

1:14:52.738 --> 1:14:54.364
You got a huge place
in my heart.

1:14:54.448 --> 1:14:55.741
Always.

1:15:11.965 --> 1:15:13.342
Bye, Jer.

1:15:25.812 --> 1:15:26.855
Hey.

1:15:29.733 --> 1:15:31.485
Was this all some game to you?

1:15:32.069 --> 1:15:33.111
What?

1:15:33.195 --> 1:15:36.323
Am I some fling?
To make Scarlet jealous?

1:15:36.406 --> 1:15:39.826
Some toy in your complicated
relationship? I mean, we just--

1:15:41.036 --> 1:15:42.246
Why did I trust you?

1:15:43.413 --> 1:15:44.581
It's not what you think.

1:15:44.665 --> 1:15:45.999
I know what I saw.

1:15:52.214 --> 1:15:53.257
Does it matter?

1:15:53.340 --> 1:15:54.633
I mean...

1:15:56.385 --> 1:15:59.346
you were always
on borrowed time here, Gail.

1:15:59.429 --> 1:16:01.265
What is that supposed to mean?

1:16:05.143 --> 1:16:07.521
The world needs to hear
that voice of yours.

1:16:08.563 --> 1:16:10.232
You can't do that from here.

1:16:11.900 --> 1:16:13.443
What you did last night...

1:16:15.404 --> 1:16:16.738
you don't belong here.

1:16:16.822 --> 1:16:18.740
There's nothin' for you here.

1:16:24.079 --> 1:16:26.123
I don't want you here, Gail.

1:16:29.751 --> 1:16:32.212
-So, that's it then?

1:16:34.756 --> 1:16:36.508
This is how we say goodbye?

1:16:45.892 --> 1:16:49.062
<i> Lila, I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>My phone got destroyed.</i>

1:16:49.146 --> 1:16:51.523
Um, I crashed Jewel.

1:16:51.606 --> 1:16:53.400
I'm on my way to LA,

1:16:53.483 --> 1:16:55.444
and, boy, do I have
a story for you.

1:16:56.653 --> 1:16:58.405
I go live Christmas Eve.

1:16:59.948 --> 1:17:02.409
Bye. Talk to you later.

1:17:27.267 --> 1:17:28.310
Is she gone?

1:17:31.521 --> 1:17:33.690
I had to let her go.

1:17:33.774 --> 1:17:35.817
Couldn't have been
the reason she stayed.

1:17:39.363 --> 1:17:41.031
You should've heard her sing.

1:17:43.158 --> 1:17:44.534
Oh, honey.

1:17:45.702 --> 1:17:46.995
I'm sorry.

1:18:20.028 --> 1:18:22.697
Gail Travers has landed.
Miss Travers has landed.

1:18:22.781 --> 1:18:24.449
-Hey, you Miss Travers?
-Hi.

1:18:24.533 --> 1:18:25.701
Great.

1:18:27.035 --> 1:18:28.703
Follow me.

1:18:28.787 --> 1:18:29.955
<i>What's your 20?</i>

1:18:30.038 --> 1:18:31.415
Stepping in.

1:18:34.626 --> 1:18:35.794
Thank you.

1:18:40.382 --> 1:18:43.093
Well, you know,
I never thought I'd be sitting
here in this chair

1:18:43.176 --> 1:18:44.845
ready for the new Sia album

1:18:44.928 --> 1:18:47.889
-and a mystery Christmas
album at that.
-I know, right?

1:18:47.973 --> 1:18:49.933
But we like to keep things
interesting around here.

1:18:50.016 --> 1:18:51.685
We sure do.
And you know what,

1:18:51.768 --> 1:18:53.353
we're gonna take a quick
commercial break

1:18:53.437 --> 1:18:55.021
and when we come back,
we're gonna talk about

1:18:55.105 --> 1:18:56.940
our big Christmas Eve Special

1:18:57.023 --> 1:18:59.985
and our five lucky
opening guests.

1:19:00.068 --> 1:19:01.820
Cut. That's a cut.

1:19:01.903 --> 1:19:03.530
Let me see that video again.

1:19:03.613 --> 1:19:05.115
Yeah. It's so good.

1:19:07.284 --> 1:19:09.202
So good.

1:19:09.286 --> 1:19:11.329
Can't wait to meet her.

1:19:11.413 --> 1:19:12.789
Have all five landed yet?

1:19:12.873 --> 1:19:14.666
Gail. Gail Travers.

1:19:14.750 --> 1:19:16.168
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Miles.

1:19:16.251 --> 1:19:17.586
-With EP Records.
-Nice to meet you.

1:19:17.669 --> 1:19:19.421
Once iHeart
puts you on the map,

1:19:19.504 --> 1:19:21.631
we, the record label,
will take care
of everything else.

1:19:21.715 --> 1:19:23.759
And I sense a real
fast track to success.

1:19:23.842 --> 1:19:26.344
I'm serious. It's in the eyes.
I can always tell.

1:19:26.428 --> 1:19:29.097
Contract needs to be
in my inbox before EOD, okay?

1:19:29.181 --> 1:19:30.515
And once you sign,
you're mine.

1:19:30.599 --> 1:19:32.559
Totally kidding.
We're gonna have some fun.

1:19:33.185 --> 1:19:34.644
PA Nation,

1:19:34.728 --> 1:19:37.481
last of the opening acts
is ready for hair
and makeup tests.

1:19:37.564 --> 1:19:39.024
Crazy day, right?

1:19:39.107 --> 1:19:42.068
Big question.
Do you want this?

1:19:47.824 --> 1:19:49.493
It's all I've ever wanted.

1:19:49.576 --> 1:19:51.244
Oh, that's a star.

1:19:51.328 --> 1:19:53.038
Ready to meet the other
contestants?

1:19:53.121 --> 1:19:56.708
Gail. You, period.
Look, period.

1:19:56.791 --> 1:19:58.835
Iconic, period.

1:19:59.461 --> 1:20:01.129
Amazing.

1:20:01.213 --> 1:20:02.714
How do you feel?

1:20:02.797 --> 1:20:04.341
-What?
-Mm.

1:20:04.424 --> 1:20:06.009
Where are the other guys? Guys?

1:20:07.052 --> 1:20:08.804
-Hey!
-Oh, my God.

1:20:08.887 --> 1:20:11.556
We are the five best voices
in all of America.

1:20:11.640 --> 1:20:13.058
#winners!

1:20:13.141 --> 1:20:15.352
Okay. Guys,
let's take a selfie.

1:20:15.435 --> 1:20:17.687
Yes. Selfie time.

1:20:17.771 --> 1:20:20.357
Gail, smile. With your teeth.

1:20:20.440 --> 1:20:22.192
Okay, no, okay. Yes.

1:20:22.275 --> 1:20:24.486
-Did you get it?
-I got it.

1:20:24.569 --> 1:20:28.740
Hold this. It's life-changing.
iHeart winning contestants,
in your face.

1:20:28.823 --> 1:20:33.411
Let's get out of here.
Craft services. Pomegranates.
Cake pops. You heard me.

1:20:33.495 --> 1:20:34.788
Let's go.

1:20:37.832 --> 1:20:39.084
-Gail?
-Yes.

1:20:39.167 --> 1:20:40.919
Walker. We spoke on the phone.

1:20:41.002 --> 1:20:43.421
The producers have attempted
a mix of your tape.

1:20:43.505 --> 1:20:46.258
A mix? It's an acoustic song.

1:20:46.341 --> 1:20:50.262
Uh, Miles said
you won't need your guitar.
We got a fresh one.

1:20:50.345 --> 1:20:53.265
Sis and Amy have clearance
questions on the intro segment.

1:20:53.348 --> 1:20:55.016
-Can you handle that?
-Already done.

1:20:56.601 --> 1:20:59.271
So, iHeart loves you.

1:20:59.354 --> 1:21:01.940
The label just
has some thoughts.

1:21:02.023 --> 1:21:04.943
Main thing, your song's
now called<i> #thisis.</i>

1:21:05.026 --> 1:21:09.573
One word. Very mysterious.
True crime is so hot right now.
"This is what?"

1:21:09.656 --> 1:21:11.408
"Find out, click here."
Bait, bait, bait.

1:21:11.491 --> 1:21:12.450
Gen Z is gonna love it.

1:21:12.534 --> 1:21:14.119
Can you hold on one second?

1:21:14.202 --> 1:21:16.955
Cody, I told you to never...

1:21:45.734 --> 1:21:49.946
Yeah, that was good.
Can I get a little more
in monitor one?

1:21:50.739 --> 1:21:52.073
Thank you.

1:21:54.743 --> 1:21:55.994
Great job.

1:21:57.579 --> 1:21:59.289
-Break a leg.
-Thanks.

1:22:01.249 --> 1:22:02.417
-Gail Travers?
-Yes.

1:22:02.500 --> 1:22:03.710
-Hi, I'm Sisanie.
-Hi.

1:22:03.793 --> 1:22:05.337
So nice to meet you.

1:22:05.420 --> 1:22:07.881
We're so excited
that you're here.
We all watched your tape.

1:22:07.964 --> 1:22:10.508
Your song "This is Christmas,"
loved it.

1:22:10.592 --> 1:22:11.885
Thank you.

1:22:11.968 --> 1:22:15.180
Obsessed. And with
this outfit, wow. I'm Amy.

1:22:15.263 --> 1:22:16.890
-Hi.
-Yeah, and we're just
so excited

1:22:16.973 --> 1:22:18.058
to hear you perform live.

1:22:18.141 --> 1:22:19.267
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Congratulations.

1:22:19.351 --> 1:22:20.352
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

1:22:20.435 --> 1:22:21.811
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:22:26.149 --> 1:22:27.525
-Added. Perfect.
-Excuse me.

1:22:27.609 --> 1:22:29.611
-Hmm?
-So, what's happening now?

1:22:29.694 --> 1:22:33.865
Uh, blocking, walk for tech.
We'll make it perfect later.

1:22:33.948 --> 1:22:36.701
-Label had
a little switcheroo.
-Mm.

1:22:36.785 --> 1:22:37.827
Kira.

1:22:37.911 --> 1:22:40.205
-Dunno. It came to me.
-Huh?

1:22:40.288 --> 1:22:43.541
-Kirsty. Kirsty Cassidy.
-Love it. Ah!

1:22:43.625 --> 1:22:44.918
But my name is Gail.

1:22:45.460 --> 1:22:46.336
Huh.

1:22:46.878 --> 1:22:47.879
Gail.

1:22:47.962 --> 1:22:49.047
Gail.

1:22:49.130 --> 1:22:50.507
-Gail.
-Gail.

1:22:50.590 --> 1:22:52.050
Just kinda feels
weird in the mouth, right?

1:22:52.133 --> 1:22:53.259
-Thick.
-Thick.

1:22:54.302 --> 1:22:55.970
Can you hold on one sec?

1:22:56.054 --> 1:22:58.139
-Can we get a jacket
or something?
-Can we get a jacket?

1:22:58.223 --> 1:22:59.683
-The look, it's...
It's just not clicking for me.
-Flying in a jacket.

1:22:59.766 --> 1:23:00.975
Fast, fast, fast.

1:23:01.810 --> 1:23:02.727
Okay.

1:23:02.811 --> 1:23:04.604
One option, Tiffany?

1:23:04.688 --> 1:23:06.106
Ooh.

1:23:06.189 --> 1:23:07.607
-No, this is actually
really cute.
-That's...

1:23:07.691 --> 1:23:09.609
I'm sorry.
My blood sugar's low.

1:23:09.693 --> 1:23:11.528
-I don't know,
I'm all over the place.
-That's Sarah, by the way.

1:23:11.611 --> 1:23:13.321
-Then who's Tiffany?
-You fired her.

1:23:13.405 --> 1:23:15.573
That does track.

1:23:15.657 --> 1:23:17.117
-Oh, you can go up now.
-Mm.

1:23:17.200 --> 1:23:18.702
Lose the bag.

1:23:45.061 --> 1:23:46.229
-Really?
-Just watch this.

1:23:46.312 --> 1:23:47.939
Okay.

1:24:18.052 --> 1:24:20.305
I feel like... I feel like
something's a little off.

1:24:36.279 --> 1:24:39.657
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I just need a moment.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:24:39.741 --> 1:24:41.826
-Sorry, sorry.
-Okay. What, what's goin' on?

1:24:41.910 --> 1:24:43.453
-Excuse me.
What are we doin' here?

1:24:43.536 --> 1:24:44.996
I just need a minute.
I need... I need a minute.

1:24:45.079 --> 1:24:47.832
-Kirsty? Kirs...
-My name is Gail!

1:24:47.916 --> 1:24:49.501
-Oh.
-It's Gail.

1:24:49.584 --> 1:24:51.336
-Gail.
-I need to... I need to go
to the bathroom.

1:24:51.419 --> 1:24:55.298
-Okay.
-All right, great.
Just get back soon.

1:24:55.381 --> 1:24:56.216
Okay. Okay.

1:24:56.299 --> 1:24:57.550
Keep it quick.

1:26:00.154 --> 1:26:01.698
There.

1:26:01.781 --> 1:26:03.241
-We won't need it.
-We could make us...
That's true.

1:26:03.324 --> 1:26:05.827
-We won't need it.
-Well, maybe, we won't.

1:26:05.910 --> 1:26:07.453
Hello?

1:26:08.121 --> 1:26:09.247
Hello?

1:26:09.330 --> 1:26:10.415
Don't, who is it?
Don't tell me you have to

1:26:10.498 --> 1:26:11.666
-go to the shop.
-Oh, hey, honey.

1:26:11.749 --> 1:26:14.210
It's Gail.
Hey, hey, hey, honey.

1:26:14.294 --> 1:26:16.254
<i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

1:26:16.337 --> 1:26:18.548
How many times
have you asked me that now?

1:26:19.757 --> 1:26:21.676
Hurry up.

1:26:21.759 --> 1:26:24.846
I sure wish
I could see your face.

1:26:24.929 --> 1:26:26.681
You're gonna need
a new phone for that.

1:26:29.809 --> 1:26:31.185
What's goin' on?

1:26:33.146 --> 1:26:34.772
I didn't know who else to call.

1:26:36.357 --> 1:26:38.902
I don't know what to do.
Everything...

1:26:38.985 --> 1:26:41.821
Everything here
is just so different.

1:26:41.905 --> 1:26:43.281
What do you mean?

1:26:43.364 --> 1:26:44.908
<i>There's just so many people.</i>
<i>So many people.</i>

1:26:44.991 --> 1:26:47.368
They're just trying
to plan my style,

1:26:47.452 --> 1:26:49.454
my identity, my future...

1:26:50.830 --> 1:26:53.124
There's just so many voices

1:26:53.207 --> 1:26:55.418
that I feel like
I'm losing mine.

1:26:55.501 --> 1:26:57.045
Oh.

1:26:58.046 --> 1:26:59.923
Okay.

1:27:00.006 --> 1:27:02.550
When you started singing,

1:27:02.634 --> 1:27:04.719
what did you want
out of all of it?

1:27:04.802 --> 1:27:06.554
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1:27:06.638 --> 1:27:08.514
I want to sing
because I love it.

1:27:09.307 --> 1:27:10.975
But why this way?

1:27:13.353 --> 1:27:14.228
Fans.

1:27:15.688 --> 1:27:17.565
Because?

1:27:17.649 --> 1:27:20.693
Well, they're the only ones
who ever stuck around for me.

1:27:21.277 --> 1:27:22.654
Oh.

1:27:22.737 --> 1:27:26.240
That's not what fans are for,
that's what family's for.

1:27:26.324 --> 1:27:29.744
<i>Now I know that</i>
<i>you didn't have one</i>
<i>for a very long time...</i>

1:27:31.204 --> 1:27:34.999
but now, you have us.

1:27:35.083 --> 1:27:38.127
<i>And sweetheart, no matter</i>
<i>how far, no matter how long</i>
<i>you're gone,</i>

1:27:38.211 --> 1:27:40.922
<i>you can always</i>
<i>come back here, Gail.</i>

1:27:41.005 --> 1:27:44.717
Harmony Springs
is here for you.

1:27:44.801 --> 1:27:49.722
<i>And listen, if those fans</i>
<i>don't love you</i>
<i>for who you truly are...</i>

1:27:49.806 --> 1:27:52.016
<i>I don't think you</i>
<i>really want this.</i>

1:27:54.936 --> 1:27:56.187
Maybe you're right.

1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:02.443
I'm probably overstepping here,

1:28:02.527 --> 1:28:04.696
but, um, Jeremy told me
what happened.

1:28:04.779 --> 1:28:07.031
<i>And I just... I just</i>
<i>need you to know that</i>

1:28:07.115 --> 1:28:08.574
it wasn't what you thought.

1:28:08.658 --> 1:28:12.370
<i>Jeremy told Scarlet</i>
<i>how he really felt...</i>

1:28:13.246 --> 1:28:14.497
<i>about you.</i>

1:28:14.580 --> 1:28:16.833
He just didn't wanna be
the reason that

1:28:16.916 --> 1:28:18.918
you second-guess
this opportunity.

1:28:23.172 --> 1:28:26.801
Okay. Well, we love you.

1:28:28.469 --> 1:28:29.846
I love you, too.

1:28:30.972 --> 1:28:32.890
All of you in Harmony Springs.

1:28:34.434 --> 1:28:36.394
<i>-Oh, Van?</i>
-Yeah?

1:28:36.477 --> 1:28:38.563
Could you remind the kids
to sing from the heart

1:28:38.646 --> 1:28:42.358
<i>tonight at the gala?</i>
<i>The county is not</i>
<i>gonna know what hit 'em.</i>

1:28:42.442 --> 1:28:45.653
I just wish that
I could be there to see it.

1:28:47.488 --> 1:28:48.656
Thank you.

1:28:49.782 --> 1:28:50.783
Bye.

1:29:09.844 --> 1:29:11.429
-She's right, you know.

1:29:11.512 --> 1:29:12.513
Your mom.

1:29:14.599 --> 1:29:17.685
Oh, she's not...
She's not my...

1:29:17.769 --> 1:29:21.731
Anyway, um, I'm sorry that
you had to hear all that.

1:29:21.814 --> 1:29:23.566
You don't have to explain.

1:29:23.649 --> 1:29:25.651
I've been exactly
where you are.

1:29:25.735 --> 1:29:27.320
But, Gail, you're good.

1:29:27.403 --> 1:29:28.738
I mean, really good.

1:29:28.821 --> 1:29:31.115
With or without
that record label.

1:29:31.199 --> 1:29:32.700
Thank you.

1:29:32.784 --> 1:29:34.702
And do you know how many times
people have tried to get me

1:29:34.786 --> 1:29:37.080
to be cuter, girlier,

1:29:37.163 --> 1:29:40.458
more country, less country.
I mean...

1:29:40.541 --> 1:29:42.126
I can't keep up.

1:29:42.210 --> 1:29:46.172
But I learned to hold on
to my favorite version
of myself.

1:29:46.255 --> 1:29:50.551
So you've got to hang on tight
to what makes you you.

1:29:50.635 --> 1:29:53.304
You have to remember
that's what got you here.

1:29:53.387 --> 1:29:57.767
And I promise if you do that,
Gail, the sky's the limit.

1:29:59.143 --> 1:30:00.436
Thank you, Amy.

1:30:00.520 --> 1:30:02.897
My travel agent's info,
it's in your inbox.

1:30:02.980 --> 1:30:05.775
So, I want you to know,
if you need
to get to that gala,

1:30:05.858 --> 1:30:08.319
you got a plane ticket,
you got a car service.

1:30:08.402 --> 1:30:11.906
Seriously, whatever you need
you decide.

1:30:11.989 --> 1:30:14.158
-But what about my bus?
-It's handled.

1:30:14.242 --> 1:30:15.535
Done.

1:30:18.204 --> 1:30:19.372
Good luck, Gail Travers.

1:30:19.455 --> 1:30:20.540
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

1:30:20.623 --> 1:30:22.333
Us girls gotta stick together.

1:30:22.416 --> 1:30:23.501
Yeah.

1:30:23.584 --> 1:30:24.794
'Kay, bye.

1:30:46.732 --> 1:30:48.526
Sisanie, I think
I have an idea.

1:30:48.609 --> 1:30:49.735
Oh, yeah?

1:31:02.790 --> 1:31:04.167
Hello?

1:31:04.250 --> 1:31:06.878
<i>Ma'am, this is Amy Brown</i>
<i>from iHeart Radio.</i>

1:31:06.961 --> 1:31:09.922
<i>I'm thinking maybe</i>
<i>you can help me with somethin'.</i>

1:31:13.134 --> 1:31:14.260
Deep breath.

1:31:18.806 --> 1:31:20.558
Release your intentions.

1:31:27.899 --> 1:31:30.735
I'm sure those are really
great intentions, guys.

1:31:30.818 --> 1:31:32.278
-You made it!
-Yes!

1:31:32.361 --> 1:31:36.574
How in the world
could I miss it?
You guys look great!

1:31:36.657 --> 1:31:38.075
Wow.

1:31:38.159 --> 1:31:40.578
Okay, people. Look alive.
We're on in three minutes.

1:31:40.661 --> 1:31:43.080
Okay, let's all head toward
backstage, okay? Come on.

1:31:43.164 --> 1:31:44.790
-Come on.
-Okay. Come on, people.

1:31:44.874 --> 1:31:45.666
-I'll be there in a minute.
-Come on. Let's go, let's go...

1:31:45.750 --> 1:31:46.667
Okay.

1:31:46.751 --> 1:31:49.670
Hey, what's goin' on, Rosemary?

1:31:49.754 --> 1:31:53.174
It's just, there's...
There's a lot of people
out there.

1:31:55.092 --> 1:31:58.179
Our class was small and...

1:31:58.262 --> 1:32:00.389
I can't sing in front of that
many humans.

1:32:00.473 --> 1:32:02.433
Hey. Hey...

1:32:02.516 --> 1:32:06.562
You taught me
that being perfect
isn't better.

1:32:07.647 --> 1:32:09.315
Whatever happens out there,

1:32:09.398 --> 1:32:11.317
it's you.

1:32:11.400 --> 1:32:15.863
And I haven't met
one single human
who hasn't loved you.

1:32:16.697 --> 1:32:18.157
Show 'em you, okay?

1:32:18.241 --> 1:32:19.408
You got this.

1:32:42.056 --> 1:32:42.974
You know...

1:32:44.350 --> 1:32:47.311
the whole "If you love her,
let her go" thing...

1:32:49.647 --> 1:32:51.524
doesn't work every time.

1:32:53.901 --> 1:32:56.737
Sorry. That whole, uh...

1:32:56.821 --> 1:32:58.322
That whole Scarlet thing...

1:32:58.406 --> 1:32:59.490
I know.

1:33:00.074 --> 1:33:00.950
I know.

1:33:04.203 --> 1:33:07.248
You... You know
I took Parker from his dream.

1:33:12.378 --> 1:33:13.879
Couldn't do that with you.

1:33:19.552 --> 1:33:23.889
He made a choice
and now I'm making one.

1:33:26.434 --> 1:33:32.064
I always hoped that somehow
my singing would bring me
to a home of my own.

1:33:33.899 --> 1:33:39.530
I've never felt more loved
or seen than I do right here.

1:33:43.117 --> 1:33:48.122
I always thought that
I couldn't write songs
because I wasn't good...

1:33:49.957 --> 1:33:54.086
but now I realize that
I just needed something...

1:33:55.755 --> 1:33:59.008
someone to write songs about.

1:34:14.440 --> 1:34:15.566
-What's your plan?
-Here's my plan.

1:34:18.944 --> 1:34:22.406
I stick around
and keep teaching
the music program,

1:34:22.490 --> 1:34:23.824
if you'll have me.

1:34:23.908 --> 1:34:26.327
Uh, I can't do that.
We just gave the job away.

1:34:26.410 --> 1:34:27.953
Oh, man.

1:34:28.037 --> 1:34:29.538
-I'm kidding.

1:34:29.622 --> 1:34:31.123
You might just
save the program.

1:34:32.458 --> 1:34:33.876
Speaking of which, we...
We'd better go.

1:34:33.959 --> 1:34:35.086
Come on,
we got a show to watch.

1:34:35.169 --> 1:34:36.504
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Let's go.

1:35:00.361 --> 1:35:03.989
Wow. Yay!

1:35:04.073 --> 1:35:06.450
Come on, come on.
Can we get another round
of applause

1:35:06.534 --> 1:35:09.286
for the Canton County
Bear Cubs?

1:35:14.041 --> 1:35:18.045
And up next, we have our final
performance of the night,

1:35:18.129 --> 1:35:20.631
your host city, the town

1:35:20.714 --> 1:35:22.883
of Harmony Springs.

1:35:26.178 --> 1:35:28.472
Light cue one.

1:37:47.152 --> 1:37:50.364
Harmony Springs! Whoo!

1:37:50.447 --> 1:37:52.116
Oh, my God.

1:37:52.199 --> 1:37:54.743
Come on. Come on,
let's give it up

1:37:54.827 --> 1:37:57.121
for the Harmony Springs
Middle School.

1:37:57.204 --> 1:37:58.831
All right!

1:38:13.971 --> 1:38:15.931
What's happening?

1:38:16.015 --> 1:38:21.979
The winner of the One Hundredth
Annual Henderson County
Christmas Gala is...

1:38:26.191 --> 1:38:28.360
Harmony Springs!

1:38:49.089 --> 1:38:50.382
-Okay. Here you go.
-Okay. Yeah.

1:38:50.466 --> 1:38:51.884
Okay, all right.
Now I need to do something,

1:38:51.967 --> 1:38:55.346
call the iHeart Live
Streaming on Facetime.

1:38:55.429 --> 1:38:58.515
-I, I got this. Okay?
-I...

1:38:58.599 --> 1:39:00.517
-Do you have the number
we're supposed to call?
-Oh, yes.

1:39:00.601 --> 1:39:03.354
-Thank you.
-All right. All right.

1:39:07.858 --> 1:39:11.695
Okay. Now all you have to do is
point the camera end...

1:39:11.779 --> 1:39:13.197
it's right there...

1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:15.824
-straight towards Miss Travers.
-Okay.

1:39:15.908 --> 1:39:17.701
-Great. Okay.
-Okay?

1:39:17.785 --> 1:39:20.454
-I think I got it.
-Let's try horizon...
That way. There we go.

1:39:20.537 --> 1:39:22.498
-Maybe you wanna get...
-That's means to the side.
Okay.

1:39:22.581 --> 1:39:25.209
a better angle from downstairs?

1:39:25.292 --> 1:39:27.002
Oh, good idea.

1:39:27.086 --> 1:39:28.587
-Okay.
-All right.

1:39:28.671 --> 1:39:30.047
Yes.

1:39:30.130 --> 1:39:31.006
Okay.

1:39:31.090 --> 1:39:31.924
Okay.

1:39:35.969 --> 1:39:38.222
-Is this thing on?
-Okay.

1:39:38.305 --> 1:39:42.184
We want to invite
our music teacher
to the mic please.

1:39:42.267 --> 1:39:44.228
-What?
-Miss Travers?

1:39:45.979 --> 1:39:47.523
To thank you
for believing in us...

1:39:47.606 --> 1:39:49.525
-Aw.
-and teaching us to sing
from the heart...

1:39:49.608 --> 1:39:52.069
-We wanted to do
something for you.
-What are you doing?

1:39:52.152 --> 1:39:53.904
Please sing for us!

1:39:53.987 --> 1:39:55.280
What?

1:39:55.364 --> 1:39:56.824
This is crazy!

1:40:01.745 --> 1:40:04.164
Aw. Thank you.

1:40:04.998 --> 1:40:06.000
Wow.

1:40:10.295 --> 1:40:11.088
Wow.

1:40:11.171 --> 1:40:12.423
Wow, wow, wow.

1:40:12.506 --> 1:40:16.468
I am so proud of all
of our amazing kids.

1:40:16.552 --> 1:40:18.929
Thank you all so much.

1:40:19.012 --> 1:40:20.431
You really want me to sing?

1:40:28.397 --> 1:40:29.648
I was gonna sing this song...

1:40:29.732 --> 1:40:31.567
on national television...

1:40:31.650 --> 1:40:35.070
but singing it right here,
right now...

1:40:35.154 --> 1:40:37.573
feels even more special to me.

1:40:37.656 --> 1:40:39.116
Thank you, Harmony Springs...

1:40:39.199 --> 1:40:42.202
for teaching me
what it means to have a home.

1:40:43.746 --> 1:40:45.873
This is, this is my...

1:40:46.874 --> 1:40:49.877
Our original song...

1:40:49.960 --> 1:40:51.670
<i>"This is Christmas."</i>

1:41:01.346 --> 1:41:05.768
<i>And now, our final special</i>
<i>performer, Gail Travers.</i>

1:41:05.851 --> 1:41:07.478
<i>Performing her original song...</i>

1:41:07.561 --> 1:41:11.315
<i>This is</i> Christmas<i> from</i>
<i>Harmony Springs, Oklahoma.</i>

1:44:27.678 --> 1:44:29.179
Yeah, Gail!

1:44:35.811 --> 1:44:37.229
Oh, my gosh!

1:44:44.611 --> 1:44:46.238
Congratulations, Gail.

1:44:47.739 --> 1:44:49.241
Thank you.

1:44:49.324 --> 1:44:50.450
Yes!

1:44:53.578 --> 1:44:55.372
-Did you get it? Yes!
-Yeah. Yeah.

1:44:55.455 --> 1:44:57.874
-One point nine million people
just watched you.
-No... What?

1:44:57.958 --> 1:44:59.209
How did you do that?

1:44:59.292 --> 1:45:01.712
Sisanie and Amy
from iHeart set it all up.

1:45:01.795 --> 1:45:02.879
-What?
-Merry...

1:45:02.963 --> 1:45:06.341
-Merry Christmas, girl!
-Yes!

1:45:06.425 --> 1:45:08.927
Okay, hey! Hey, Harmony Springs
on three, yeah?

1:45:09.011 --> 1:45:10.512
-One, two, three...
-Two, three...

1:45:10.595 --> 1:45:12.222
Harmony Springs!

1:45:12.305 --> 1:45:13.140
Let's go!

1:46:16.244 --> 1:46:19.206
If teachers were apples,
we would pick you.

1:46:21.166 --> 1:46:22.292
Every time.

1:46:31.718 --> 1:46:33.136
Who's ready to rock?

1:46:33.220 --> 1:46:35.180
Yes!
