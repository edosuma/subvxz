WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:05.606
Previously on E.R.--

00:05.639 --> 00:06.774
Why the hell are you working
the night before your Boards?

00:06.807 --> 00:07.808
It was supposed
to be Morris's shift,

00:07.841 --> 00:09.343
but he's taking them, too.

00:09.377 --> 00:11.412
You get stuck on the test,
squeeze this,

00:11.445 --> 00:13.114
the answer will come.

00:13.147 --> 00:15.183
That was so cool, defending us
from Moretti like that.

00:15.216 --> 00:18.552
Well, we were just discussing
different teaching philosophies.

00:18.586 --> 00:19.820
Well, yours is better,
which is why there's no way

00:19.853 --> 00:21.589
I'm going to present to him.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.691
My girlfriend Lacy-- her
homecoming dance is coming up.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.593
Help me.
I'm-I'm a virgin.

00:25.626 --> 00:26.827
I'm not a nun.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.462
I'm a woman
who happens

00:28.496 --> 00:29.563
to be a chaplain.

00:29.597 --> 00:30.764
You've been going
to meetings?

00:30.798 --> 00:31.799
Yes.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.801
It's like I'm actually trying

00:33.834 --> 00:35.503
to screw things up.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074

00:47.181 --> 00:49.517
(baby Joe fussing)

00:54.555 --> 00:57.057
(fussing stops)

01:06.600 --> 01:09.137
(Joe fussing slightly)

01:09.137 --> 01:11.139
(Lockhart sniffling)

01:17.345 --> 01:20.781
Soon they'll be blaming this
on global warming.

01:20.814 --> 01:23.217
Yeah. All those years
of plastic cups

01:23.251 --> 01:25.219
and Styrofoam are
coming home to roost.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.555
So, because I've used spray
can deodorant my whole life,

01:27.588 --> 01:29.290
now I'm supposed
to feel guilty

01:29.323 --> 01:31.725
about the resurgence
of malaria in Kenya?

01:31.759 --> 01:33.261
You speak
so crazy, Frank.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.163
I read it in the paper.

01:35.163 --> 01:37.398
I read that cow farts are going
to be the death of all of us.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.632
Cow farts?

01:38.666 --> 01:39.833
Yeah, we eat too
much livestock,

01:39.867 --> 01:41.702
which release gases
into the atmosphere,

01:41.735 --> 01:42.770
killing the ozone.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.505
Thank you,
Al Gore.

01:44.538 --> 01:47.308
I would rather drop dead
right now over a bone-in rib eye

01:47.341 --> 01:49.477
than live forever
on organic spinach.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.911
The truth is very
inconvenient.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.247
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you,

01:53.281 --> 01:54.715
but I have gotten smart.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.185
Hooked myself up
with a tight little sex machine,

01:57.185 --> 02:00.321
energy efficient to the tune
of 40-plus miles per gallon

02:00.354 --> 02:03.491
and draws babes to Archie
like bees to honey.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.859
Ew! That made me throw
up in my mouth a little.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.495
Me, too.
LOCKHART:
What about Hope?

02:07.528 --> 02:09.830
Didn't you take an oath
of fidelity or something?

02:09.863 --> 02:12.400
Yeah. What, she's saving
starving kids in Venezuela,

02:12.433 --> 02:14.202
and you're out here
cruising for chicks?

02:14.235 --> 02:15.469
Hope? Hope, Hope...

02:15.503 --> 02:16.437
Oh, oh, that Hope.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.738
Yeah. Uh, we broke up.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.273
TAGGART:
No, you didn't.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.741
You did?

02:20.774 --> 02:22.276
I'm sorry.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.377
No. No big deal.

02:23.411 --> 02:24.478
It was very...
It was very mutual.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.380
That's good.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.482
Except it was all her idea,
and I begged her not to do it.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.418
But I'm fine with it now.
It's all good.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.652
Lady for you on
three, chief.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.354
Hope she chokes
on a mojito.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.289
Says she's your ex-wife.
Something about your son.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.424
Oh. All right.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.492
I'll take it, uh, in there.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.962
He was married?
Poor woman.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.631
RASGOTRA:
Ah, the very person

02:43.664 --> 02:44.698
we're looking for.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.434
(imitates
engine revving)

02:46.467 --> 02:47.635
What's he doing?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.303
Oh, don't forget
the clutch, dummy.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.405
Well, you said I could teach him
to drive your car today.

02:51.439 --> 02:52.573
I did?
Yeah, you did.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.242
No, no, no, no, no.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.244
That was before I hooked
up my new wheels.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.411
You have new wheels? Cool.

02:57.445 --> 02:58.812
No. No, not cool.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.714
I'm not going to let
some prepubescent intern

03:00.748 --> 03:01.982
ding up my
chick magnet.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.351
Is it? For reals?

03:03.384 --> 03:04.618
MORRIS:
This car

03:04.652 --> 03:06.420
makes a statement,

03:06.454 --> 03:08.789
and the statement is,
"I am bringing sexy back."

03:08.822 --> 03:10.724
Sweet!
Um, hello?

03:10.758 --> 03:11.925
Look, he's got
his homecoming soon.

03:11.959 --> 03:12.993
He wants to be able
to drive his date.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.862
Give the kid a break.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.630
(engine starting)
Oh! I had to pull
strings to get this.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.299
You can't even buy
one of these babies yet.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.734
Well, I'll get you the number
of that new PACU nurse.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.002
The one from Nashville?

03:22.035 --> 03:24.272
I heard she was in the circus.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.473
She does look
flexible.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.575
All right.

03:27.608 --> 03:28.676
Okay. Fine.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.544
Now. Now, let's see.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.012
What are you doing?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.747
Doing a walk-around.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.483
I want to make sure it comes
back in the same condition.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.684
God, you're so anal.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.552
Pristine, beautiful,
unblemished.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.020
Thank you,
Dr. Morris.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.755
Now, let's run down
a few things here.

03:41.789 --> 03:42.823
Wait...

03:42.856 --> 03:43.957
Harold, the brake!
Hey!

03:43.991 --> 03:45.393
Wait! Wait!
Harold?

03:45.426 --> 03:47.428
Harold, be...
Be careful, Harold!

03:47.461 --> 03:49.430
Stay aware of
your surroundings!

03:49.463 --> 03:51.532
It's all about peripheral vi...

03:51.565 --> 03:52.866
(grunting)

04:10.484 --> 04:12.386
(distant voices)

04:21.462 --> 04:23.564
GATES:
What we're talking
about here is pain.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.898
Proactively treating it

04:24.932 --> 04:27.468
right here in triage
with you guys, all right?

04:27.501 --> 04:28.936
Most of you
know how to use

04:28.969 --> 04:30.037
the Wong-Baker Scale.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.572
(baby crying)

04:31.605 --> 04:32.440
GATES:
Any kid coming in,
we assess the pain

04:32.473 --> 04:34.074
from zero to ten.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.344
Any score above zero, we give
them analgesia at the desk.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.479
Put it on your charts.
The docs will be checking.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.713
Someone's been
Morettisized.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.081
Mm-hmm, Gates drank
the Kool-Aid.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.483
GATES:
How old?
Three months.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.551
She's been
like this for hours.

04:43.584 --> 04:44.718
Okay.
Fussy, crying.

04:44.752 --> 04:45.886
It's probably
the heat.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.355
Chuny, can you
take her back?

04:47.355 --> 04:48.656
I got this.
Follow me.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.358
It's never been
this bad before.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.925
All right, here,
check this out.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.594
MORRIS:
Come on, guys,
stop goofing around!

04:53.627 --> 04:55.996
Victim of auto
versus pedestrian.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.565
Possible blunt
head trauma.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.367
The car didn't hit me.
I walked into it.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.068
I told them that.
What's with
the backboard?

05:01.101 --> 05:02.636
Patient resisted treatment,
so we took all precautions.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.005
I do not meet
trauma center criteria.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.840
What do we have here?
He was
combative on scene.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.742
No, I wasn't!
A little bit,
a little bit.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.444
Because I don't need
any of this.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.779
Might need
a head CT.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.481
Definite possibility,
Dr. Gates.
What?!

05:13.514 --> 05:16.083
No. No! I don't need
spinal immobilization.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.452
No, no, no, no. No,
you might need
an X-ray, sir,

05:18.486 --> 05:19.820
before you
take this off.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.655
No, the hell you do,
and stop calling me sir!

05:21.689 --> 05:23.591
Oh, could be a
distracting injury.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.393
Distracting... I'm going to
distract your face with my foot!

05:25.426 --> 05:26.927
Look! Huh? Huh?
I'm fine.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.397
All this
wasted energy

05:29.430 --> 05:32.400
is seriously inflating
my carbon footprint.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.801
So, are you refusing
medical care, sir?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.469
Yes. Yes, I am.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.004
So you're going to sign
a form indicating that

05:37.037 --> 05:38.672
you're leaving this ER
against medical advice?

05:38.706 --> 05:40.408
Screw you guys.

05:40.408 --> 05:42.443
You're wasting valuable time
and resources on this

05:42.476 --> 05:43.677
silly little
comedy routine.

05:43.711 --> 05:44.812
Ooh!
Aah!

05:44.845 --> 05:45.846
Stupid doors.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.481
(snickering)

05:47.515 --> 05:49.717
Next time that happens,
give him a Foley in the field.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.585
(Pratt snickers)

05:53.787 --> 05:55.456
JULIA:
Make sure your grandma

05:55.489 --> 05:57.691
follows up with the clinic
visits, okay, Jeffrey?

05:57.725 --> 06:01.161
Refuah shleima,
Beatrice.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.863
Toda raba,
Ms. Dupree.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.435
And a happy
shana tovah to you.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.702
Oh, nice try.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.571
Jewish New Year
was two months ago.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.005
Oh, I got you
your musicians.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.807
My what?

06:13.841 --> 06:15.676
Well, you said you wanted some
help brightening up the place,

06:15.709 --> 06:17.678
alleviating the misery, so,

06:17.711 --> 06:21.449
Ken and Willow Monterey,
this is Dr. Gates.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.850
Oh, hello!
Thanks for
having us.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.452
This is our first
time in the ER.

06:24.452 --> 06:25.719
We're super-excited.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.555
We mostly perform
in Pedes.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.189
Love bringing joy
to the little people.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.625
But this gives
us a chance to
dig a bit deeper

06:31.659 --> 06:33.461
into the old
set list.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.695
Oh, good.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.064
All right, well, uh,
make yourself at home.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.732
BOTH:
Namaste.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.200
Nama...

06:40.233 --> 06:42.570
(Julia sighs)

06:42.603 --> 06:45.205
Where'd you find
them, God Camp?
(scoffs)

06:45.238 --> 06:46.707
Oh, man, I almost forgot.

06:46.740 --> 06:47.908
Is it...? It is.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.777
Today's the day.

06:49.810 --> 06:50.878
What day?
Uh, D-day.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.179
Or Independence Day.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.748
Starting to sound
like Stupid Day.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.216
Don't push me, Sam.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.951
It's hot, and I don't know
where my Smart Car is.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.120
Greg and I get
our Board results back today.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.689
I'm worried about him.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.724
I'm not sure
he hit the books hard enough.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.059
Hey, Vin Diesel,
where's my car?

07:06.093 --> 07:08.496
It's parked around the corner.
I've got to go to a laparotomy.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.063
Zelinsky,
did you damage that vehicle?

07:10.097 --> 07:12.032
Oh, no, sir, not that I
know of... well, uh,

07:12.065 --> 07:13.701
yeah, a little.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.035
What?!
RASGOTRA:
A little ding to the fender.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.737
Miniscule.
Gives it character.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.105
Personality.
You'll hardly notice it.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.206
I got to go.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.207
Air conditioner
broke down

07:20.240 --> 07:21.975
at the nursing home.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.243
Multiple victims with
hyperthermia and dehydration.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.112
Another five
coming in the van.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.681
Yeah, they turned our place
into Kentucky Fried Old Folks!

07:27.715 --> 07:29.517
How you doing, sir?

07:29.550 --> 07:33.153
Hey, I did not survive a pogrom,
a gulag and bris in a back alley

07:33.186 --> 07:35.088
just so that I could
be baked like a strudel!

07:35.122 --> 07:37.558
DUMAR:
This is J.J. Perkins,
80 years old, ALOC,

07:37.591 --> 07:39.092
history of
hypertension,
previous MI.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.127
Temp high of 104.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.529
Mr. Perkins?

07:41.529 --> 07:42.663
PERKINS:
Thirsty.

07:42.696 --> 07:43.864
Positive O sign.
Not good.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.198
Is he okay?
We're roommates!

07:45.232 --> 07:47.267
Hey, Grady, get
some more wheelchairs.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.836
Power shortage, my ass.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.871
The engineers
are selling off the energy

07:50.904 --> 07:54.107
to the highest bidder, just like
they did in California.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.243
You know who's getting it all?
The Pakis!

07:56.276 --> 07:57.277
WILLOW:
* Say hip hop...

07:57.310 --> 07:58.746
Hey! Where'd they put my buddy?

07:58.779 --> 07:59.847
WILLOW:
* ...to the hip hip hop

07:59.880 --> 08:01.715
* You don't stop a rockin'

08:01.749 --> 08:03.083
* To the bang bang boogie,
say up jumped the boogie *

08:03.116 --> 08:05.085
* To the rhythm
to the boogie, the beat *

08:05.118 --> 08:07.120
(baby crying)
* Skiddly bee-bop, a-bee-bop,
a scooby doo *

08:07.154 --> 08:08.556
* And guess what, guy?

08:08.556 --> 08:09.857
* We love you

08:09.890 --> 08:11.559
* Now what you hear
is not a test *

08:11.592 --> 08:13.260
* I'm rappin' to the beat

08:13.293 --> 08:15.629
WOMAN:
Do you think our
apartment's too hot for her?

08:15.663 --> 08:17.230
I can't say yet.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.766
(baby crying)

08:18.799 --> 08:20.634
Any vomiting or diarrhea?

08:20.668 --> 08:22.235
No, none of that.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.171
* To the black, to the white,
the red and the brown *

08:24.204 --> 08:25.873
Does anything help
to calm her down?

08:25.906 --> 08:28.041
Car rides
or noise machines?

08:28.075 --> 08:30.210
She doesn't like
any noise really.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.813
Even music.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.082
Well, I can't say I blame her
for that right now.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.585
WOMAN:
Our doctor thought
it was reflux,

08:37.618 --> 08:39.019
so she ordered
this scope test.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.253
Uh-huh. And?

08:40.287 --> 08:42.022
Everything was normal.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.991
Do you think
it could it be colic?

08:44.024 --> 08:47.160
Well, we have to rule out
some other stuff first.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.797
How are you guys holding up?

08:49.830 --> 08:52.633
Mm...

08:52.666 --> 08:55.669
it's been
kind of hard.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.304
MAN:
This heat and the brownouts.

08:57.337 --> 09:00.641
She just seems so unhappy
all the time.

09:00.674 --> 09:01.842
It gets easier.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.011
It does.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.146
I'm going to run this
by my supervisor. I'll be back.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.348
* And on and on
and on and on... *

09:08.381 --> 09:10.851
Now, the next time
that the power goes out,

09:10.884 --> 09:13.821
don't go using jumper cables
to juice up the AC, okay?

09:13.854 --> 09:15.856
Where I went wrong was,
I had the wide screen

09:15.889 --> 09:18.225
and the massage chair hooked
up to the same battery.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.661
* First I was afraid,
I was petrified *
(sighs)

09:20.694 --> 09:22.630
* Kept thinking
I could never live *

09:22.663 --> 09:24.164
* Without you by my side

09:24.197 --> 09:26.033
* And I spent
so many nights... *

09:26.066 --> 09:27.668
Three-month-old,

09:27.701 --> 09:28.869
intermittent crying spells
times three months.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.704
The kid's whole
life, huh?

09:30.738 --> 09:32.673
If it's been going on that
long, it's not an emergency.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.975
Well, seems to be
okay-- afebrile, alert.

09:35.008 --> 09:38.045
Fontanelle's flat, no signs
of injury, exam's benign.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.312
Of course it is.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.314
Exam's always normal
in babies like this.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.884
* I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give *

09:43.917 --> 09:45.719
Okay, I'll check it out soon.

09:45.753 --> 09:46.987
First, I got
to put a stop to this.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.722
Where the hell is Gates?

09:48.756 --> 09:50.290
More importantly,
where are our Board results?

09:50.323 --> 09:51.992
Oh, they're
not in yet.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.962
But the Vegas odds are
ten-to-one you both failed.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.363
PRATT:
Look, just tell Gates
to get rid

09:56.396 --> 09:57.931
of the Captain and Tenille.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.099
We're supposed
to be healing people here,

09:59.132 --> 10:00.734
not driving them
to suicide.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.402
You nervous?
About the results?
No. Are you?

10:02.435 --> 10:03.971
No.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.839
You got those old
folks all fixed up?

10:05.873 --> 10:07.708
Yeah, Moretti ordered
evaporative cooling.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.142
I got Javier
babysitting.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.844
All right, let me know
if you need any help.

10:10.878 --> 10:13.280
* Do you really want
to hurt me? *

10:13.313 --> 10:17.718
* Do you really want
to make me cry? *

10:17.751 --> 10:19.720
Patient was
in his usual state

10:19.753 --> 10:22.055
of excellent health
until 1:00 p.m. today,

10:22.089 --> 10:23.691
when he got up
from the living room sofa...

10:23.724 --> 10:26.093
Okay, stop-- I'm
bored and lost.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.127
You're going to
put him to sleep.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.929
But that's the history.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.064
Yes, yes, presented in the
most obtuse way possible.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.666
What do you think
is wrong with this guy?

10:32.700 --> 10:34.367
Dehydration.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.737
Okay, spit it out up front, so
Mussolini doesn't eat you alive.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.706
And can you please
shoot me or shoot them?

10:38.739 --> 10:40.207
I really don't care which.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.009
How's it going?

10:42.042 --> 10:45.212
It's weird, this music
seems to be soothing her.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.446
That is weird.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.682
My supervisor's
on his way over.

10:48.716 --> 10:49.883
Okay, Grady,
one more time.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.451
65-year-old man,
syncopal episode

10:51.484 --> 10:52.953
after skipping
breakfast and lunch.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.888
Okay, now I know
what you're thinking.

10:54.922 --> 10:57.124
No chest pains, palpitation,
weakness, headache.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.726
That's what I'm talking about.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.761
Please, Gates,
make them go away!

11:00.794 --> 11:02.362
Yeah, I'm with her.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.931
I pushed them in the back.
What do you want me to do?

11:03.964 --> 11:05.365
OTHERS:
Get rid of them!

11:05.398 --> 11:07.267
Guy, what they're doing
is a nice thing, okay?

11:07.300 --> 11:08.836
And some people
actually like it.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.071
Oh, yeah?
What people?

11:11.104 --> 11:13.173
(Frank singing along)
Frank's not people.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.308
I'll see what I can do.
* I want to be sedated...

11:15.342 --> 11:16.910
MORETTI:
Grady?

11:16.944 --> 11:19.112
Break room-- it's time
to present. Come on.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.181
Say, here's an update, folks.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.784
Green line is down,
there's scattered looting

11:23.817 --> 11:26.419
on the West Side, we got
two X-ray machines out,

11:26.453 --> 11:28.055
the temperature

11:28.088 --> 11:30.323
in the O.R. is 84
degrees, and, uh,

11:30.357 --> 11:33.426
oh, oh, oh, that's
right, boys, the, uh,
test scores are in.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.862
What?!
What?!

11:34.895 --> 11:35.996
Why didn't you
say something?

11:36.029 --> 11:38.065
Stop playing games.
Hey, man.

11:38.098 --> 11:42.302
Hey... you got us
waiting like this.

11:42.335 --> 11:43.937
FRANK:
So, did the Medical Board

11:43.971 --> 11:46.039
make another deadly
error in judgment?

11:46.073 --> 11:47.775
Yes, they have, Frank,
I passed.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.410
(cheering and laughter)
Hey!

11:50.443 --> 11:51.779
Congratulations.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.113
Morris?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.147
Come on, baby.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.348
Yeah... it's good.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.416
It's all good.
Yes, they passed!

11:56.449 --> 11:58.451
My man.
Morris and Pratt passed!

11:58.485 --> 12:00.788
All right, after work,
drinks on me and Morris.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.355
All right.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.392
WILLOW & KEN:
* Nothing to do, nowhere to go

12:05.425 --> 12:07.127
* I wanna be sedated.

12:08.962 --> 12:09.997
MAN (on TV):
You stole her, didn't you?

12:10.030 --> 12:10.998
MAN 2:
What?!
She's mine.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.033
Says who?
Says me.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.067
Yeah, well,
she came to me.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.268
Damn power.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.037
I'm telling you,
it's the Pakis.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.806
Oh, that's not nice,
honey.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.507
Chuny, how's Mrs. Lidner?

12:20.540 --> 12:23.176
Down to 99,
she's perking up.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.412
Chest X-ray clear,
no hypernatremia.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.080
Hey, you should
see this, J.J.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.415
It's very good.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.516
What's it
called again?

12:29.549 --> 12:31.418
Grumpy Old Men.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.153
How's Mr. Perkins doing?

12:33.186 --> 12:35.856
He's fine, hey, he's better,
leave him alone.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.324
Minimally responsive,

12:37.357 --> 12:39.860
tachy to 130, having
some ectopy on the monitor.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.328
Hey, we were hot
and thirsty.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.196
We don't need
any more witchy medicine.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.397
Shh.
Temp?

12:44.431 --> 12:45.465
The cooling blanket

12:45.498 --> 12:49.569
didn't help, he's still 103.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.839
Mr. Perkins?
(mumbles)
Hey,

12:51.872 --> 12:53.506
don't do that.
What are you doing to him?

12:53.540 --> 12:54.541
His neck's stiff.
Are we missing meningitis?

12:54.574 --> 12:55.876
GRADY:
He's stiff all over.

12:55.909 --> 12:56.910
Increased muscle tone.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.478
Let's go--
Trauma Two.

12:58.511 --> 12:59.579
Blood cultures,
two milligrams ceftriaxone.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.148
Let's get a head CT.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.983
Stop it, you, you're
not a real doctor.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.151
I want a real doctor.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.185
You're some
stuffed-up quack!

13:05.218 --> 13:06.553
JAVIER:
Calm down.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.221
He's going to be
all right, right?

13:08.255 --> 13:09.356
Sure.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.158
Relax.

13:11.191 --> 13:14.527
(Matthau and Lemmon
grunting and shouting on TV)

13:16.496 --> 13:20.067
DUBENKO:
Worse when I press...
or let go?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.468
The same.
CT?

13:21.501 --> 13:24.404
White count
is 11.2.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.439
Mildly inflamed appendix
that doesn't fill

13:26.473 --> 13:28.208
with oral contrast.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.342
Looks like early
appendicitis.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.111
WANG:
Oh, geez,
I need surgery?

13:31.144 --> 13:32.512
If we take it out
laparoscopically,

13:32.545 --> 13:34.147
you'll be back
home tomorrow.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.548
HAROLD:
Might we be jumping
the gun here?

13:35.582 --> 13:37.550
There is an alternate
diagnosis to consider.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.953
It could be epiploic
appendagitis.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.421
Rather unlikely, Doctor.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.123
So, in terms of the
laparoscopic procedure...

13:43.156 --> 13:46.493
He hasn't been vomiting,
he's got a normal white count.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.561
No single sign,
symptom, or test

13:48.595 --> 13:50.898
confirms the diagnosis
of appendicitis.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.065
Okay?

13:52.099 --> 13:53.400
So as I was
saying...

13:53.433 --> 13:55.102
Just hold the phone
a minute.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.436
The CT isn't
that impressive...
Dr. Zelinsky.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.371
Harold.
If I'm on to something,

13:58.405 --> 14:00.240
then he'll get better
with rest and nonsteroidals.
Dr. Zelinsky.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.075
He won't need surgery.

14:02.109 --> 14:03.610
So I don't need surgery?

14:05.445 --> 14:07.180
That's not what we're saying.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.415
His CT lacks all

14:08.448 --> 14:09.549
of the predictable findings

14:09.582 --> 14:11.551
to support your theory, okay?

14:11.584 --> 14:13.520
I don't want an
unnecessary operation.

14:13.553 --> 14:14.922
Are you sure?

14:14.922 --> 14:16.123
I'm very sure.
Dr. Rasgotra

14:16.156 --> 14:17.457
will be back to
consent for surgery.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.026
I'll see you in the O.R.
Okay.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.228
Thanks, Mary.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.530
Uh, Dr. Dubenko,
I'm interested in
why you think...

14:23.563 --> 14:26.033
Harold.
...that the CT shows no signs
of an ovoid pericolic lesion.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.534
Shut up now.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.568
(Willow & Ken singing
"Killing Me Softly")

14:28.601 --> 14:29.970
Go round.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.204
Drinks at Ike's
on Morris and Pratt.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.272
They passed
their Boards.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.041
Wow, great.
Uh-huh.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.308
Um, I'd like to discuss

14:35.342 --> 14:36.409
Zelinsky's progress with you.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.610
Yeah, about that...

14:37.644 --> 14:39.412
Tomorrow, not now.
Tomorrow?

14:39.446 --> 14:40.547
I don't want
to say anything too cruel,

14:40.580 --> 14:42.115
which I am at risk of doing

14:42.149 --> 14:43.516
if we discuss it at
this moment, so...

14:43.550 --> 14:45.218
we'll talk
about Dr. Rain Man tomorrow.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.154
WILLOW & KEN:
* With his words...

14:47.187 --> 14:50.123
Can you help me out
here, please, a little?

14:50.157 --> 14:52.525
You want me
to fire the volunteers?

14:52.559 --> 14:55.095
Yes, in a nice way.

14:55.128 --> 14:59.299
Look, they love them in Pedes,
they're a hit in oncology.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.468
Why do you ER types have
to be such snobs?

15:01.501 --> 15:04.537
Just do what God would do--
cast these people out.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.573
Nice.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.142
The mocking use of religious
imagery always works with me.

15:09.176 --> 15:10.643
Well, I'm just trying
to speak to you

15:10.677 --> 15:12.012
in a language you
understand, that's all.

15:12.045 --> 15:15.315
Bye.
* Da, da, da

15:15.348 --> 15:18.585
* Da...

15:18.618 --> 15:20.988
* La...

15:21.021 --> 15:22.289
Still having ectopy.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.324
300 amiodarone I.V.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.594
So chest pain in three should
have had an EKG and troponin,

15:27.627 --> 15:30.330
but the resident
cancelled the orders.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.232
He's breathing. Sat's OK.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.700
Dawn, bring
them in.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.202
What resident?

15:35.235 --> 15:36.603
Lockhart.
Did you sign off on it?

15:36.636 --> 15:38.171
Uh, must have
been Pratt.

15:38.205 --> 15:39.206
I'm sure there was
a good reason.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.673
What are you doing
to J.J.?

15:40.707 --> 15:42.442
Shh.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.277
Mr. Leftkowitz,

15:44.311 --> 15:46.346
did Mr. Perkins have
any new pills at the home?

15:46.379 --> 15:47.680
They're always
giving us pills.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.216
If you can't poop,
they give you a pill.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.583
If you complain
about the government,

15:50.617 --> 15:51.684
you get a pill.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.486
Can you be more specific?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.122
Try to get people
to vote for Obama--

15:55.155 --> 15:56.589
they got a pill
for that, too.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.691
Papi, listen, did they give J.J.
anything today?

15:58.725 --> 16:01.694
He got feisty because
it was so hot in there.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.130
Does this look
familiar?

16:03.163 --> 16:04.197
How about this?

16:04.231 --> 16:05.232
Maybe this--
it was yellow.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.067
Bingo. Haloperidol.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.736
I bet he's got neuroleptic
malignant syndrome.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.671
Interesting theory.
Dantrolene

16:11.704 --> 16:13.473
100 milligrams I.V.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.576
(crying)
I'm pretty sure
what we have here

16:16.609 --> 16:20.047
is a beautiful, healthy little
girl with a bad case of colic.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.615
That's what
the pediatrician said.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.084
There's nothing
we can do,

16:24.117 --> 16:25.385
like no medicines
you can give her?

16:25.418 --> 16:27.220
No, you just have
to wait it out.

16:27.254 --> 16:30.057
But it's too hot to keep her
all wrapped up like that.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.659
We read a book that said
to do that when she gets fussy.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.062
No, not in this weather.
Now, if you feel the blanket,

16:35.095 --> 16:36.663
you'll see she sweated
right through it.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.798
That's normal, she gets
all worked up when she feeds.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.068
All right, well,
just hang in there.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.435
PRATT:
A nurse will be back with
your discharge paperwork.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.771
Abby.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.306
Hey, do me a favor.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.774
See if you can get
some kind of referral

16:47.807 --> 16:50.577
for some new parenting
group or something.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.213
That's it? You don't want
to do any more of a workup?

16:53.246 --> 16:54.247
For colic?

16:54.281 --> 16:55.482
No, why?

16:55.515 --> 16:56.716
There's no need,
it's classic.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.551
Well, it's not classic,
actually.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.220
When I worked in OB,

17:00.253 --> 17:02.089
we did a lot of anticipatory
guidance about this

17:02.089 --> 17:04.790
and colic doesn't usually
start until six weeks of life.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.226
This baby's been fussy
since birth.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.493
It hasn't
killed her yet.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.529
Yeah, but the sweating
when she feeds

17:09.561 --> 17:11.330
could be an indication...
It's a million
degrees outside.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.732
Her parents keep her
wrapped up like a burrito.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.534
I have a feeling...

17:14.567 --> 17:16.669
Look, this is a long-term
pre-existing condition

17:16.703 --> 17:18.438
with no signs of abuse.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.107
Just let them follow up
with the pediatrician.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.574
And Abby, relax, okay?

17:21.608 --> 17:23.576
You are now talking

17:23.609 --> 17:24.844
to a board-certified emergency
medicine attending, thank you.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.713
You still have
to take the oral boards.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.316
Nothing but a
mere technicality.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.717
See you at Ike's?

17:30.750 --> 17:33.420
(chuckles)

17:33.453 --> 17:35.655
So we done
with them?

17:35.688 --> 17:36.689
The Burke baby.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.292
Um... yeah.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.395
Hey, wait, no.

17:42.429 --> 17:43.830
Sorry.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.599
Hold on, I just want to
check one more thing.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.800
Hey, you coming out
tonight?

17:47.834 --> 17:49.469
It's Brownout Thursday
at Ike's.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.171
Drinks half-price
if you bring a candle.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.573
I thought Pratt and
Morris were buying.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.442
Only a round--
cheap bastards.

17:55.475 --> 17:56.709
Come on,
let loose for a night.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.711
I'll think about it.

17:58.745 --> 18:03.150
Your AC is putting out air at
77 degrees through this duct.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.751
You mean it's working.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.753
Yeah, but it's 62 degrees
at the compressor.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.355
That's a lot of waste.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.656
Hey, Frank, what's going on?

18:09.689 --> 18:11.491
Oh, the green
Nazis are here.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.726
Oh, you must be
the energy manager.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.495
Ethan McInerney.

18:15.528 --> 18:16.729
And you are...?
Sam Taggart,
the charge nurse.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.565
I spoke to your office.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.799
We, uh, made sure to change
out the incandescents

18:19.832 --> 18:21.434
for compact
fluorescents.

18:21.468 --> 18:22.869
We're down to
30 foot-candles.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.471
That's very green of you.

18:24.504 --> 18:25.505
Just doing our part.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.839
Maybe you can show me

18:26.873 --> 18:28.175
where the utility access is
around here.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.910
Sure, uh,
come with me.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.314
I'm going out back and burn
some tires with kerosene.

18:34.347 --> 18:35.782
You good with that?

18:35.815 --> 18:37.750
I'm leaving
these for Sam.

18:37.784 --> 18:38.851
You're out of here already?

18:38.885 --> 18:40.520
What about the party?

18:40.553 --> 18:43.223
God, it's like junior
high around here.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.357
Hi.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.792
Bye.
Shift over already?

18:45.825 --> 18:48.795
Uh, Pratt's up to
speed on my stuff.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.930
Your intern presented to me.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.666
Did he forget to kiss the ring?

18:53.700 --> 18:56.603
No, in fact,
Grady was letter-perfect,

18:56.636 --> 18:59.239
which I'm sure had absolutely
nothing to do with you.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.909
Absolutely nothing.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.380
MORETTI:
Doctor.

19:07.414 --> 19:08.415
(groans quietly)

19:08.448 --> 19:10.517
Doctor.
Yeah?

19:10.550 --> 19:11.551
I understand you've
been canceling

19:11.584 --> 19:12.785
my preemptive orders.

19:12.819 --> 19:13.953
(sighs)

19:13.986 --> 19:15.788
In selected cases,
I have, yes.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.557
On what criteria?

19:17.590 --> 19:19.892
Well, a 20-year-old with
epigastric pain from ibuprofen

19:19.926 --> 19:21.794
doesn't need a CBC,
chem panel, and a UA.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.864
He needs to be sent home
with some antacid.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.499
But that's an exception.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.435
I mean, the system
is the system

19:28.468 --> 19:29.669
and the system is working.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.504
Yeah, not for me.

19:31.538 --> 19:35.342
I didn't go to med school
to check boxes and push paper.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.544
When are you going to stop
with the end-runs, huh?

19:37.577 --> 19:38.811
Huh?

19:38.845 --> 19:40.613
I mean, what is it?

19:40.647 --> 19:42.382
You just feel more
comfortable with Dr. Pratt

19:42.415 --> 19:43.950
because you've worked
with him longer or...

19:43.983 --> 19:46.586
or is this just, like, the
path of least resistance?

19:46.619 --> 19:48.621
Or is it simply that
you just don't like me?

19:48.655 --> 19:50.857
What?

19:50.890 --> 19:51.891
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

19:51.924 --> 19:52.959
What doesn't matter?

19:52.992 --> 19:54.261
If I "like" you
or not?

19:54.294 --> 19:55.528
No, forget it, forget it.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.764
No, I don't like you.
You know what?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.766
You do whatever the
hell you want, okay?

19:59.799 --> 20:01.468
And I hope it all
works out for you.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.877
Folks, local power grid
might be going down,

20:10.910 --> 20:13.680
but don't worry, we're prepared.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.548
Is somebody going to make
a toast or something?

20:15.582 --> 20:17.016
No, no, no, nobody's
saying anything

20:17.049 --> 20:18.651
until my partner
in crime gets here.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.520
Oh, and by the way,
I know I'm still on,

20:20.553 --> 20:22.889
so this is a Seven and Seven
minus one of the Sevens.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.624
(laughs)
Can you guess
which one?

20:24.657 --> 20:26.326
Hey, here he is!

20:26.359 --> 20:28.861
(all cheering and applauding)

20:28.895 --> 20:31.564
Can't stay long, somebody's got
to mind the store.

20:31.598 --> 20:32.865
Well, then,
allow me.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.501
We are going to talk later.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.269
I saw what you did to my car.
It takes

20:36.303 --> 20:37.837
a lot of years
of training...
Is he mad at me?

20:37.870 --> 20:39.506
to become a doctor...
No.
Shh...

20:39.539 --> 20:40.773
He is.
...and a lot
of successes,

20:40.807 --> 20:41.841
a fair amount
of failures

20:41.874 --> 20:43.343
as well,
but I think

20:43.376 --> 20:44.711
it's important
that we all reflect

20:44.744 --> 20:46.313
and appreciate
the milestones,

20:46.346 --> 20:48.448
so I would like
to be the first

20:48.481 --> 20:51.784
to congratulate Dr. Pratt
and Dr. Morris,

20:51.818 --> 20:54.787
who will become
newly-minted,

20:54.821 --> 20:57.690
soon-to-be
Board-certified...

20:57.724 --> 21:01.528
ALL:
...attending emergency
physicians.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.464
(all cheering)
Salut!

21:04.497 --> 21:07.567
This chaplain thing,
it's really more of a hobby.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.601
(grunts)

21:08.635 --> 21:10.337
My true passion...

21:10.337 --> 21:11.571
is hustling pool.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.740
I see.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.875
You know, I got to tell you,
to be honest,

21:15.908 --> 21:18.578
you don't really strike me
as the chaplain type.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.413
Mm! And why is that?

21:20.447 --> 21:22.515
I don't know-- 'cause you
don't look the part.

21:22.549 --> 21:24.484
I mean, the way you dress,

21:24.517 --> 21:27.387
your vibe, your... tat.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.988
Oh, I have lots of tats.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.056
Oh, yeah?

21:30.089 --> 21:31.691
Uh-huh.

21:31.724 --> 21:32.825
What is, what is that one?

21:32.859 --> 21:34.594
It's a labyrinth.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.095
It's a pretty common symbol,
actually,

21:36.128 --> 21:38.731
in the Native American cultures,
in the Vedas.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.099
The Minoans use it, too.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.501
Hmm.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.470
It represents
life's real journey--

21:43.503 --> 21:46.673
the spiritual journey
to the inner self.

21:50.677 --> 21:53.680
Reminds me every day
that I have to constantly

21:53.713 --> 21:56.383
be seeking.

21:56.416 --> 21:59.952
And how easy it is to get lost.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.921
Have you been lost?

22:03.523 --> 22:05.525
Haven't you?

22:07.059 --> 22:08.828
So what other tats you got?

22:19.706 --> 22:21.741
You know Harold was just
trying to impress you.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.643
I thought we weren't
going to talk about this now.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.712
Well, I don't understand
why you don't like him.

22:25.745 --> 22:28.848
He's unshaped,
he's immature.
Smart.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.517
That's not enough.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.051
Well, he's a little rough
around the edges, sure,

22:32.084 --> 22:33.686
but instead of getting

22:33.720 --> 22:35.822
hung up about
the presentation,

22:35.855 --> 22:37.757
maybe we should
start commending
him on the insight.

22:37.790 --> 22:41.428
And by "we," I of
course mean "you."

22:41.428 --> 22:44.597
He's not ready to be
a surgeon on my team, Neela.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.966
Lucien, he wants
to be here so badly.

22:46.999 --> 22:49.035
I believe he can do it.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.139
You really want
to mentor this kid?

22:53.172 --> 22:56.075
Well, if you'll agree not
to kick him out.

22:56.108 --> 22:58.545
Give me a month.

22:58.578 --> 23:01.481
It's not just about turning him
into a doctor, Neela.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.916
It's about turning him
into an adult.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.051
Do you understand that?

23:05.084 --> 23:06.619
ZELINKSKY:
Oh, hey, guys.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.521
Looks like I'm getting
kicked out.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.022
Check you on the flipside!

23:13.125 --> 23:15.161
Okay, you've got a month.

23:15.194 --> 23:17.830
It's weird to think
of Morris and Pratt

23:17.864 --> 23:19.566
as the top of the heap.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.501
I still remember
when Mark Greene

23:21.534 --> 23:23.202
and Doug Ross were
running the place.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.671
Who?
Who?

23:24.704 --> 23:26.172
ETHAN:
Hey, Sam.

23:26.205 --> 23:29.175
Hey!
I came over soon as I
was done with my evaluation.

23:29.208 --> 23:30.877
Um, this is Chuny.

23:30.910 --> 23:31.911
Hi.
And Dawn.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.513
Hey.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.748
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

23:35.782 --> 23:36.916
Anybody need anything
from the bar?

23:36.949 --> 23:38.150
Nothing.
No, I'm good.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.952
Apple martini.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.688
Coming up.

23:45.692 --> 23:46.959
Hello?

23:46.993 --> 23:48.828
What?

23:48.861 --> 23:50.963
What's up with the fine brother?

23:50.997 --> 23:53.600
He wanted to see if I wanted
to have a drink after work,

23:53.633 --> 23:56.603
so I just...
What about your hunky beat cop?

23:57.837 --> 24:00.707
You sly dog.
No, no, no.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.108
It's not like that.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.043
It's just, um...

24:04.076 --> 24:05.878
Okay, you know that time
in your life

24:05.912 --> 24:08.548
when you're in your teens
or your early 20s?

24:08.581 --> 24:10.550
You know, when you get
to look around

24:10.583 --> 24:12.885
and see what you like
and what you don't like?

24:12.919 --> 24:14.020
You mean, like positions?

24:14.053 --> 24:15.888
(all laughing)

24:15.922 --> 24:17.890
No, it's like...

24:17.924 --> 24:19.959
Well, I never had that.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.694
And I think I should.

24:21.728 --> 24:24.564
So, now is my chance.

24:24.597 --> 24:25.532
You know what I mean?

24:25.565 --> 24:26.966
Oh, yeah,

24:26.999 --> 24:28.668
we know what you mean.
Mm-hmm, the boy in blue

24:28.701 --> 24:29.902
wasn't hitting that buzzer.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.771
(all laughing)

24:31.804 --> 24:32.805
That's not true.

24:32.839 --> 24:35.642
Apple martini.

24:37.276 --> 24:39.245
I miss something?

24:39.278 --> 24:42.014
Let's hope you don't.

24:42.048 --> 24:43.583
LOCKHART:
Excuse me.

24:43.616 --> 24:45.685
Hey, hey, hey,
is this where the party is?

24:45.718 --> 24:47.286
Hey, Abby!
What's up?

24:47.319 --> 24:48.888
Hey.
Hey.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.623
Abby, what's happening?

24:50.657 --> 24:52.925
Hey. It does not look
very festive in here.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.661
(laughing)

24:54.694 --> 24:56.929
That's better.
Oh, no, no, no.

24:56.963 --> 24:58.798
Better.
Do I have to?

24:58.831 --> 25:01.668
Frank? Frank.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.235
I love Frank.

25:03.269 --> 25:04.804
(laughing)

25:04.837 --> 25:06.573
Frank never misses a party.

25:06.573 --> 25:07.807
Where have you been?

25:07.840 --> 25:08.975
Nowhere.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.944
Sam, you look fantastic.
Yes?

25:11.978 --> 25:13.245
I do?
You look so hot.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.981
(giggling)

25:15.014 --> 25:16.849
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.085
You're getting some,
aren't you?

25:19.886 --> 25:21.954
You are.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.856
Hi.

25:23.890 --> 25:24.924
Hey.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.093
Who's he? Who are you?

25:27.126 --> 25:29.328
Ethan. Ethan McInerney.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.997
I work for the County

25:31.030 --> 25:33.265
as an Energy...
(growls)

25:34.967 --> 25:38.004
Look at his eyes.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.806
He's very sincere.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.241
Hey...
(horn blares)

25:42.274 --> 25:43.876
Congratulations.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.244
All right, come on,
let's get some coffee.

25:45.277 --> 25:46.746
Oh, no, thank you.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.347
No, thank you, boss.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.083
It's a night
to celebrate, right? Right?

25:51.117 --> 25:53.185
Tonight is a night
to celebrate, right?

25:53.219 --> 25:55.622
Am I right, Chuny?
You are right.

25:55.655 --> 25:58.958
What... what is Chuny
short for, anyway?

25:58.991 --> 26:00.660
Nothing, just Chuny.

26:00.693 --> 26:02.228
Actually my real name is Ethel.

26:02.261 --> 26:04.731
Get out!
No, I'm serious.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.833
Frank, put that hat back on!

26:06.866 --> 26:08.067
NEELA:
Abby.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.235
Hi.
Hi.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.303
Uh-oh, surgeons are here.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.873
You guys better be careful,

26:13.906 --> 26:15.307
because you are
outnumbered.

26:15.341 --> 26:18.711
And if there's a throwdown,
we will kick your ass.

26:18.745 --> 26:21.113
Oh, is there going
to be a throwdown?

26:21.147 --> 26:25.017
You never know,
Lucien, you never know.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.153
Heads up.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.723
Um, who wants a drink?

26:30.757 --> 26:32.892
No, we're good.
Anybody?

26:37.063 --> 26:38.230
What's up? It's a party.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.166
Cheer up.

26:42.168 --> 26:43.670
Is she all right?

26:43.670 --> 26:46.072
Yeah, she's just
letting off some steam.

26:46.105 --> 26:48.174
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

26:53.212 --> 26:55.882
Oops.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.186
Hi.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.722
Hi.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.160
I didn't expect
to see you here.

27:08.194 --> 27:11.197
Oh, well, yeah, I, um...

27:11.230 --> 27:14.333
I had a babysitter,
so I just figured, you
know, what the hell.

27:14.366 --> 27:17.203
Yeah.

27:19.806 --> 27:21.774
(banging)

27:21.808 --> 27:24.376
Can I get something, please?

27:31.050 --> 27:33.152
Hey, look, about before...

27:33.185 --> 27:36.088
You shouldn't do that,
you know.

27:36.122 --> 27:38.891
What?

27:38.925 --> 27:41.227
What you've been doing.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.730
What have I been doing?

27:43.730 --> 27:47.800
Playing the tyrant
and then flirting.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.971
Flirting?

27:52.004 --> 27:53.372
Yeah.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.808
You should stop that.

27:55.842 --> 27:58.811
Okay. I was not aware
that I was flirting...

27:58.845 --> 28:00.379
I'm not stupid, you know.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.081
No, I know...
I never said you were stupid.

28:02.114 --> 28:03.282
I never said that.

28:03.315 --> 28:04.483
Okay?
Good, 'cause I get it.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.219
You come in here on your

28:07.253 --> 28:09.822
white horse
and you just figure...

28:11.758 --> 28:13.826
What? What?

28:16.428 --> 28:17.830
What do I figure?

28:25.537 --> 28:29.008
Nothing. You just "figure."
PRATT:
Abby.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.476
Hey!
Hey.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.178
I just got paged back
on the Burke baby.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.246
She's been screaming for
an hour and the parents

28:34.280 --> 28:36.783
are threatening
to sign out AMA.
Who?

28:36.783 --> 28:38.184
The baby we saw.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.052
Oh, yes.

28:40.086 --> 28:42.789
Sorry.
That's her prerogative.

28:42.789 --> 28:44.791
Their prerogative.
Their prerogative.

28:44.791 --> 28:46.425
You were supposed to discharge
them before you left.

28:46.458 --> 28:49.361
Now instead, they're waiting
on studies that someone ordered

28:49.395 --> 28:51.430
without my permission,
studies that

28:51.463 --> 28:53.532
this kid doesn't need.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.835
Now, do you have any idea
who could have done that?

28:57.804 --> 28:59.271
Was it me?

29:01.240 --> 29:02.541
You know what?

29:02.574 --> 29:03.843
Let's take this outside.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.344
Okay.

29:10.850 --> 29:13.352
Okay, if I ordered tests,

29:13.385 --> 29:15.822
I'm sure I had
a very good reason, Greg.

29:15.822 --> 29:16.989
Even if you don't
remember it?

29:17.023 --> 29:18.925
I remember it.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.226
What's the big deal?

29:20.259 --> 29:22.361
A chest film shouldn't
take this long.

29:22.394 --> 29:25.131
It does when half
the X-ray machines in
the hospital are down.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.566
Oh...
You know, totally
disregarded my instructions

29:27.599 --> 29:30.536
to send these people home.
Okay, power trip,
what do you want?

29:30.569 --> 29:32.271
I'll go over there.
I'll discharge them.

29:32.304 --> 29:34.540
What? No, no, no, you
can't be serious right now.

29:34.573 --> 29:36.075
Well, I don't know.
It's your party.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.844
Cry if you want to,
I'll just take care of it.

29:37.877 --> 29:40.246
No, no, no, no.
You're not going anywhere

29:40.279 --> 29:42.081
near the ER like this.
Like what?

29:43.582 --> 29:46.919
Hey!
Like what? Huh, what?

29:46.953 --> 29:48.154
You know what?
What?

29:48.187 --> 29:49.956
I don't know what
your problem is,

29:49.989 --> 29:52.491
but you should really take
a cab home right now, really.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.235
Whatever.

30:03.269 --> 30:06.038
Both guests of honors are gone,
this place is kind of dead.

30:06.072 --> 30:08.340
I know a little blues place
over by Northwestern.

30:08.374 --> 30:10.276
Mm! I know where we can go.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.311
There's a little place that has
salsa nights on Thursdays.

30:12.344 --> 30:13.880
(all agreeing)

30:13.913 --> 30:15.281
DAWN:
Hey, hey, Abby.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.849
We're getting ready
to go somewhere else.

30:16.883 --> 30:18.550
You want to come?

30:18.584 --> 30:21.120
No, um, I'm just going to finish
this and get out of here.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.189
GRADY:
You sure?
Yeah, but have fun.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.560
Did you drive here?

30:28.594 --> 30:30.897
No.
Okay.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.971
I got his attention.

30:39.005 --> 30:40.973
(groans)

30:44.076 --> 30:46.145
Thank you.

30:47.246 --> 30:48.380
Everything okay?

30:48.414 --> 30:50.482
Yes, work thing.
Fixed it.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.490
So where's your husband?

30:58.524 --> 30:59.892
He's in...?
Croatia.

30:59.926 --> 31:01.360
Croatia.
Mm-hmm.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.495
How much longer is he
going to be there?

31:03.529 --> 31:06.098
You would have to ask him that,

31:06.132 --> 31:09.335
'cause he was supposed
to be home weeks ago.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.503
Oh.

31:11.537 --> 31:14.506
It's hard to, um...
it's complicated to balance

31:14.540 --> 31:17.543
the whole-- you know,
the kids and the spouse...

31:17.576 --> 31:19.411
You want to hear
about a complicated life?

31:19.445 --> 31:22.381
I will make you cry.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.150
Really.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.351
I'm not kidding.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.419
Really?
(chuckles)

31:28.554 --> 31:30.389
I'm sorry.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.491
Mm-hmm.

31:34.426 --> 31:37.429
Look...

31:37.463 --> 31:39.031
what you said before...

31:39.065 --> 31:41.300
Yeah, forget about it.
Listen to me.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.568
I'm an asshole.

31:42.601 --> 31:44.103
I know.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.238
(chuckles)

31:46.272 --> 31:48.674
Well... just forget about it.
You're not. You're not.

31:48.707 --> 31:50.376
Really, okay?
All right, all right,
all right, all right....

31:53.312 --> 31:56.448
It's a good thing about
Pratt and Morris, though.
Yes.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.350
That's good.
Here's to Pratt
and Morris.

31:58.384 --> 31:59.986
Yep, Pratt and Morris.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.989
Whoops.

32:05.524 --> 32:06.692
Oh, sorry, sir.
I'm sorry.

32:06.725 --> 32:08.560
Sorry about that.
No problem.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.997
We ain't closing for
no stinking blackout,
either, all right?

32:11.030 --> 32:12.431
Next round's on me.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.489
(thud)

32:37.523 --> 32:39.591
MAN:
Damn.

33:03.549 --> 33:05.617
(groans)

33:12.524 --> 33:14.626
Power's back.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.073
This family shouldn't
even be here.

33:27.073 --> 33:29.541
The plan was
chest X-ray and EKG,

33:29.575 --> 33:31.643
and then discharge if the
studies are normal, right?

33:31.677 --> 33:33.645
That was Abby's
plan, not mine.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.747
(baby crying)
How's she doing?

33:35.781 --> 33:38.384
She's been, uh, sweating
and breathing really fast

33:38.417 --> 33:40.219
ever since I fed her.

33:40.252 --> 33:41.753
She's retracting.
MORRIS:
And really diaphoretic.

33:41.787 --> 33:43.722
TIFFANY:
No fever, her temp's normal.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.657
You guys better check this out.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.094
(crying continues)

33:48.094 --> 33:50.196
MORRIS:
Heart's big.

33:50.229 --> 33:51.797
Yeah, and her lungs are wet,
she's in failure.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.166
HALEH:
What's the sat?
Uh... I don't know.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.834
You don't know?
I'll do one now.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.504
So, all this started happening
after she had a bottle?

33:58.537 --> 34:01.107
MORRIS:
Sweating with feeds is a sign
of congenital heart disease.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.374
What's going on?

34:02.408 --> 34:03.375
I'm sorry, you're
confusing us.

34:03.409 --> 34:04.610
Someone tell us what's going on.

34:04.643 --> 34:05.844
Her heart's not pumping
strong enough

34:05.877 --> 34:07.513
and the fluid's backing up
into her lungs.

34:07.546 --> 34:08.679
How come she
doesn't have an I.V.?

34:08.714 --> 34:09.547
I was told she was going home.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.150
Get me an I.V. kit.

34:11.183 --> 34:13.119
PRATT:
And where's the EKG
Abby ordered?

34:13.152 --> 34:15.321
I haven't done it yet.
MORRIS:
We're moving to One, let's go.

34:15.353 --> 34:17.322
Listen, I know you're new and
I don't know your name yet...

34:17.356 --> 34:19.257
It's Tiffany.
...but that EKG
was ordered hours ago.

34:19.291 --> 34:20.826
We didn't have neonatal
leads down here.

34:20.859 --> 34:21.793
I called central supply.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.329
Central takes forever.

34:23.362 --> 34:24.830
You can't wait for them
on a day like this.

34:24.862 --> 34:26.165
Run to the NICU. Run.

34:26.197 --> 34:27.632
Get those leads
and get back here.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.534
Where did you find that one?

34:29.568 --> 34:32.371
MORETTI:
You sure you don't want
to have a glass of water

34:32.404 --> 34:33.505
or a cup of coffee
or something?

34:33.539 --> 34:35.141
I gotta go.
Before you go?

34:35.141 --> 34:36.507
(clears throat)
Yeah.
I gotta go.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.344
What happened?
How did I get here?

34:38.377 --> 34:39.511
Well...

34:39.545 --> 34:41.147
I mean...

34:41.147 --> 34:42.581
Look, why don't you stay
for a little bit.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.250
Don't drive right now.
It's late.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.484
Oh, my God.
I don't think
you should go.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.219
I gotta go.
Wait, Abby, hold on.

34:47.253 --> 34:48.719
Wait a minute.
Honey, wait, wait.
No, I gotta go.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.255
Abby...
What are you doing?!

34:50.289 --> 34:51.290
Don't!

34:51.322 --> 34:53.159
All right, sorry.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.296
Dr. Morris?

34:57.329 --> 35:00.299
Is she...?

35:00.332 --> 35:02.168
You sure the leads
aren't reversed?

35:02.168 --> 35:03.302
I checked three times.

35:03.335 --> 35:04.470
Look at the lateral leads.

35:04.503 --> 35:05.837
Oh, damn.

35:05.871 --> 35:08.274
All right, call Cards,
we're on our way up.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.309
The blood flow to your baby's
heart has been compromised.

35:10.342 --> 35:11.810
We're not sure how.

35:11.843 --> 35:14.546
And the EKG shows the classic
pattern of an acute MI.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.582
An M... an MI?
What's an MI?

35:16.615 --> 35:17.649
Your daughter's
having a heart attack.

35:17.683 --> 35:19.351
Come on, let's go.

35:19.385 --> 35:20.752
We're taking her up to
the cath lab right now.

35:20.786 --> 35:21.853
We're gonna do everything
we can for her.

35:21.887 --> 35:23.722
You told us to go home!

35:23.755 --> 35:25.824
You said we should go home!

35:25.857 --> 35:28.927
(sobbing):
Why did you tell us to leave?

35:28.960 --> 35:33.865
He told us to go home.

35:33.899 --> 35:37.303
I don't know, Officer,
I don't know.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.770
(door closes)

35:38.804 --> 35:40.272
Okay.

35:40.306 --> 35:41.907
It's okay, she's home now.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.210
Doris, I'm really sorry.
I'm so sorry.

35:44.243 --> 35:45.677
It's almost 3:00
in the morning.

35:45.711 --> 35:47.946
I know, I'm really sorry,
and you can go now.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.449
But he, um, he slept
the whole time, right?

35:50.482 --> 35:51.783
He just slept?

35:51.817 --> 35:53.785
Are you okay?
What's the matter?

35:53.819 --> 35:55.254
Here you go,
just take that.

35:55.287 --> 35:57.323
Take that and take that.

35:57.356 --> 35:58.924
And you can go now.
Take that.

35:58.957 --> 36:00.692
Maybe I should stay--
you're worrying me.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.494
No, I'm okay, honey.
I'm fine.

36:02.528 --> 36:03.962
I can call my mother,
tell her I won't be home.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.265
Oh, my God, please,
get out of here.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.371
(sniffles)

36:12.404 --> 36:13.839
(softly):
Hi.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.974
(sniffles)

36:16.007 --> 36:17.609
Hey, Joe.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.511
Hey, buddy.

36:20.479 --> 36:23.649
How you doing?

36:23.682 --> 36:26.585
We're gonna go see
your daddy, huh?

36:26.618 --> 36:28.387
(crying)
It's going to be okay.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.622
All right, sweetie.

36:30.656 --> 36:34.393
(Joe crying)

36:41.367 --> 36:43.335
(exasperated sigh)

36:48.440 --> 36:49.775
It's all right.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.411
It's okay.
It's okay, honey.

36:52.444 --> 36:53.845
Shh, shh, it's okay.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.914
(crying continues)

37:00.852 --> 37:03.455
(Joe wailing)

37:23.509 --> 37:28.013
Hey, taxi!

37:30.549 --> 37:32.618
I'm going to O'Hare.

37:32.651 --> 37:35.454
(Joe whimpering)

37:35.487 --> 37:37.489
International.

37:37.523 --> 37:39.691
Ow! Ah...

37:39.725 --> 37:43.028
Lady! You can't hold the
kid like that in here.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.730
Yeah, it's okay, just go.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.465
(Joe crying)
Go!

37:46.498 --> 37:48.434
Croatia, please.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.636
Uh, Zagreb, Dubrovnik, whatever
you got, just get me there.

37:50.669 --> 37:52.438
Ma'am...
Um, and do you guys
go through

37:52.471 --> 37:53.839
London or Frankfurt?

37:53.872 --> 37:55.707
London, but...
London it is then.

37:55.741 --> 37:57.075
Ma'am, there are no
flights going out tonight.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.610
Yeah, but, you just need
to get me a ticket, okay?

37:58.644 --> 38:00.479
Because of the blackout,
it's affected all our...

38:00.512 --> 38:01.780
All right,
but just give me a ticket.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.482
It doesn't have to be
for right now.

38:03.515 --> 38:04.516
Okay, you need
to calm down.

38:04.550 --> 38:06.051
No, you need to do your job

38:06.084 --> 38:08.053
and sell me a ticket, okay?

38:08.086 --> 38:10.389
Ma'am, you need to
relax a minute before
we can do anything.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.391
I don't understand what's so
hard about this, I really don't.

38:12.424 --> 38:14.360
I have a passport,
and I have a credit card.

38:14.360 --> 38:17.429
And I'm not a terrorist.
Do I look like a terrorist?

38:17.463 --> 38:18.464
I think she's been drinking.

38:18.497 --> 38:19.631
Why do you have to be so bitchy?

38:19.665 --> 38:21.500
Okay, you can't call me a bitch.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.535
I didn't call you a bitch.
There's no need
for language.

38:23.569 --> 38:24.870
I said you were bitchy.
It's not the same thing.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.838
Okay, here's how
this is gonna go.

38:26.872 --> 38:29.641
You won't be getting a ticket
or boarding a flight to anywhere

38:29.675 --> 38:31.577
as long as you keep
behaving like this.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.412
So I want you to go
sit down over there,

38:33.445 --> 38:34.646
get yourself together

38:34.680 --> 38:36.114
so I don't have
to call Security.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.649
Got me?

38:37.683 --> 38:39.651
(Joe crying)

38:44.456 --> 38:46.692
(softly):
Shh...

38:46.725 --> 38:49.661
(Joe crying)

38:59.505 --> 39:01.607
Shh...

39:11.550 --> 39:13.485
Keep the urine alkaline

39:13.519 --> 39:15.487
and recheck labs in
another six hours.

39:15.521 --> 39:18.790
I'll let the ICU know.

39:18.824 --> 39:20.859
You'll have your
roommate back tomorrow.

39:24.162 --> 39:26.532
He doesn't trust
lawyers, accountants,

39:26.565 --> 39:29.501
anybody with a
degree, but...

39:29.535 --> 39:32.838
he appreciates
what you did.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.443
Uh...

39:40.846 --> 39:43.749
As doctors go...

39:43.782 --> 39:47.586
you seem to be
a pretty decent one.

39:47.619 --> 39:51.890
So... thanks.

40:00.098 --> 40:01.633
Hey.

40:01.667 --> 40:03.168
Just got back
from the cath lab.

40:03.201 --> 40:05.637
Baby was born with an
anomalous left main coronary.

40:05.671 --> 40:08.173
Blood was getting diverted
into the GI tract.

40:08.206 --> 40:10.008
The heart gets shafted, which
explains the fussiness

40:10.041 --> 40:12.478
after feeds--
she was having angina.

40:12.511 --> 40:13.645
They can fix it?

40:13.679 --> 40:14.980
Well, she's in
the O.R. now.

40:15.013 --> 40:16.748
Cards said
the prognosis was good.

40:16.782 --> 40:18.584
Guess we got lucky.
Hell, yeah, we got lucky.

40:18.617 --> 40:20.752
I don't remember any questions
like this on the Boards.

40:20.786 --> 40:23.121
Come on, coffee's on you.

40:25.190 --> 40:26.692
Looks like we
survived the blackout.

40:26.725 --> 40:29.628
Yep. The news said
Commonwealth Edison's

40:29.661 --> 40:32.531
got it all under control.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.101
(laughs softly)

40:36.134 --> 40:37.969
I failed, Greg.

40:38.003 --> 40:40.071
What?

40:41.006 --> 40:43.074
Oh.

40:44.643 --> 40:45.944
Why didn't you say something?

40:45.977 --> 40:47.813
I was ashamed.

40:47.846 --> 40:49.881
It happened so fast, everybody
was so psyched for us.

40:49.915 --> 40:52.250
Look, man, the only thing
that this test measures

40:52.283 --> 40:54.085
is how well you take the test.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.121
Doesn't mean
you can't keep working.

40:56.154 --> 40:58.657
Just have to take it again,
now, come on.

40:58.690 --> 40:59.925
Wh...

40:59.958 --> 41:02.193
In the meantime...

41:02.227 --> 41:03.962
maybe we can keep
this between us.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.731
Not tell anybody.

41:05.764 --> 41:07.132
Yeah, if that's
what you want.

41:07.165 --> 41:09.668
(laughs):
Oh, man.

41:09.701 --> 41:11.202
Especially Abby.

41:11.236 --> 41:12.871
She coached me a little
on the side,

41:12.904 --> 41:14.740
when I had some
family stuff a while back.

41:14.773 --> 41:16.875
I kind of feel like
I let her down.

41:16.908 --> 41:19.177
Eh, well, I'm sure she wouldn't
see it that way, but okay.

41:19.210 --> 41:20.946
We won't tell anyone.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.681
Thank God for Abby, huh?

41:22.714 --> 41:24.750
She saved that
kid's life.

41:24.783 --> 41:26.084
Yeah.

41:26.117 --> 41:28.019
Thank God for Abby.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.829
(Joe crying)

41:37.863 --> 41:41.066
(Lockhart sniffles)

41:46.972 --> 41:49.040
(Joe crying)

42:14.132 --> 42:16.267
(Joe fusses)

42:22.741 --> 42:25.110
(softly):
Shh...

42:25.143 --> 42:27.846
(crying)
