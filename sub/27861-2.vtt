[man]<i> Lorenzo.</i>

01:32.645 --> 01:33.685
Lorenzo.
Ready?

01:36.685 --> 01:37.645
Ready.

01:38.245 --> 01:39.085
Good.

01:40.365 --> 01:41.325
[horse neighs]

01:42.565 --> 01:43.685
-Now go!
-[horse neighs]

01:44.085 --> 01:45.685
[Giuliano shouting] Go, Lorenzo, go!

01:53.805 --> 01:54.885
[horse neighs]

01:56.365 --> 01:58.765
Lorenzo, that was really bad.

01:58.845 --> 02:00.445
You're never going to kill anyone.

02:00.525 --> 02:02.325
Giuliano, he's not meant to kill anyone.

02:02.605 --> 02:04.005
Then what's the point?

02:04.685 --> 02:06.285
To demonstrate skill, of course.

02:06.365 --> 02:07.765
Your brother would be good at this.

02:07.845 --> 02:09.205
He's good at everything.

02:10.285 --> 02:11.245
Thank you.
Here.

02:14.644 --> 02:15.565
Let me show you.

02:19.725 --> 02:21.405
Joust is a performance.

02:22.805 --> 02:24.205
We must show skill.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.285
And honor your family name.

02:26.845 --> 02:28.445
You must live for it. [clicks tongue]

02:43.565 --> 02:44.405
How was that?

02:44.525 --> 02:46.885
But if I hit a man like that
I could kill him.

02:47.845 --> 02:48.725
You could.

02:49.445 --> 02:51.045
Why take the chance if it's just a game?

02:51.605 --> 02:54.285
[Contessina] Because Medici men
teach their sons they must win.

02:54.365 --> 02:55.365
In everything.

02:56.005 --> 02:57.325
[man] If you are precise,

02:57.565 --> 02:59.405
you are less likely to hurt your opponent.

03:00.485 --> 03:02.565
And if by not hurting him I lose?

03:02.925 --> 03:04.725
You will have won in the eyes of God.

03:08.085 --> 03:11.445
A great man does good, Lorenzo.

03:12.205 --> 03:14.405
You must do and be good.

03:15.205 --> 03:17.325
If that means you suffer defeat today,

03:17.925 --> 03:20.485
trust you'll find a way
to claim victory tomorrow.

03:21.045 --> 03:22.045
Or the next day.

03:23.485 --> 03:24.885
Or the day after that.

03:31.605 --> 03:32.685
You don't agree.

03:37.765 --> 03:38.805
Yeah, and Lorenzo,

03:41.245 --> 03:44.685
you have been schooled in ideas
I do not pretend to understand

03:46.165 --> 03:49.365
but I know philosophy
is cold comfort in defeat.

03:51.525 --> 03:52.885
Not just this family,

03:53.605 --> 03:55.685
but all of Florence is counting on you.

03:57.365 --> 03:58.925
You must not lose.

04:01.165 --> 04:03.085
No matter what anyone says.

04:15.245 --> 04:16.405
[footsteps approaching]

04:20.845 --> 04:22.565
Here to put the old man out of pasture?

04:24.605 --> 04:25.524
Yes.

04:28.445 --> 04:30.765
Well, I guess you couldn't wait for him
to step down any longer.

04:30.845 --> 04:33.045
-I had no choice.
-Oh, you had a choice.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.285
Yes,

04:39.485 --> 04:40.845
I did have a choice.

04:41.965 --> 04:43.525
We both knew this day would come.

04:44.605 --> 04:46.645
I just didn't think it would come so soon.

04:47.805 --> 04:49.405
Lorenzo, your father's awake.

05:06.285 --> 05:07.205
Lorenzo.

05:08.565 --> 05:10.005
What news of Sforza?

05:18.925 --> 05:20.605
The Duke has stood down his men.

05:21.165 --> 05:22.325
He rides back to Milan.

05:23.805 --> 05:25.245
Then we have lost the bank.

05:26.325 --> 05:27.165
No.

05:28.165 --> 05:30.485
No, the Priori have agreed
to give us time

05:31.085 --> 05:32.365
to cover our debts.

05:33.045 --> 05:34.445
On what condition?

05:38.645 --> 05:39.805
That you retire.

05:41.365 --> 05:43.325
This is Pazzi's mischief.

05:43.685 --> 05:45.965
-when he couldn't kill me.
-No, no, don't, Father.

05:53.445 --> 05:54.365
It was me.

05:55.765 --> 05:56.605
You?

05:59.885 --> 06:01.365
I took your place.

06:02.645 --> 06:03.485
You?

06:04.085 --> 06:06.085
It was the only way to stop Sforza.

06:06.165 --> 06:08.045
By defying me?

06:09.165 --> 06:10.125
Father.

06:11.725 --> 06:13.405
-Did you know about this?
-No, she didn't.

06:13.485 --> 06:14.525
But I would have supported it.

06:15.285 --> 06:16.725
To spare the people of Florence.

06:16.845 --> 06:19.485
So, the betrayal is total!

06:21.845 --> 06:24.885
Your grandfather always preferred you,
even when you were a boy.

06:25.965 --> 06:27.605
It's made you arrogant.

06:27.685 --> 06:29.605
Piero, it's done nothing of the kind.

06:29.685 --> 06:33.245
I'm trying to save the Florence
that you worked so hard to build!

06:33.565 --> 06:35.645
Don't use your words on me, boy.

06:36.325 --> 06:38.365
You've destroyed me.

06:38.965 --> 06:40.965
And the bank's debts
still need to be covered,

06:41.045 --> 06:43.325
there's so much you don't understand!

06:43.405 --> 06:44.605
I'm traveling to Rome.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.605
To ask the pope for an extension.

06:46.685 --> 06:48.005
Paul won't give it to you!

06:48.085 --> 06:49.485
Well, I'll ask nonetheless.

06:50.685 --> 06:52.445
Pazzi will seize the moment,

06:52.525 --> 06:56.325
take the pope's accounts for himself
and rule Florence once and for all.

06:56.405 --> 06:57.445
Yes.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.125
I'm sure he'll try.

06:59.205 --> 07:02.845
You gained your position
by betraying your own father.

07:02.925 --> 07:05.005
It's a stain on your name.

07:08.885 --> 07:09.925
Then I'll remove it.

07:11.085 --> 07:12.045
[sighs]

07:12.885 --> 07:14.285
You have my word.

07:24.925 --> 07:26.645
He'll come 'round, give him time.

07:26.725 --> 07:28.085
Now I must pack for Rome.

07:28.485 --> 07:29.405
You?

07:29.725 --> 07:31.765
Well, you don't think I'd let you
go to Rome by yourself, do you?

07:32.685 --> 07:33.525
[bells tolling]

07:38.085 --> 07:39.365
[indistinct chatter]

07:54.805 --> 07:56.125
[giggling]

08:00.605 --> 08:01.845
My brother's bound for Rome.

08:02.925 --> 08:05.805
Lorenzo has been groomed
to lead your family since birth.

08:05.885 --> 08:08.205
His address before the Priori
was magnificent.

08:08.325 --> 08:10.045
Even your uncle voted in favor.

08:10.525 --> 08:13.205
The Priori had cast their votes,
my uncle had no choice.

08:13.685 --> 08:15.365
Why must you be so pessimistic?

08:16.405 --> 08:17.645
Realistic.

08:18.725 --> 08:21.485
Bianca, my uncle chafes
under the yoke of Medici power

08:21.565 --> 08:22.765
it doesn't matter who wields it.

08:22.845 --> 08:24.805
But this changes everything for us.

08:25.045 --> 08:27.925
There will be peace between our families,
I'm sure of it.

08:28.005 --> 08:29.525
I'm sure your brother would wish it.

08:30.605 --> 08:32.605
But my uncle will oppose him
now more than ever.

08:34.605 --> 08:36.125
Lorenzo will find a way.

08:36.845 --> 08:37.965
You'll see.

08:46.365 --> 08:48.164
[man] Ah, we were afraid we'd miss you.

08:48.245 --> 08:50.005
Will you return in time
for the tournament?

08:50.085 --> 08:52.285
-I hope so.
-Then you can stop being so boring

08:52.365 --> 08:53.725
and get back to having some fun.

08:55.525 --> 08:58.005
-Give my love to Carlo.
-We shall.

08:58.965 --> 08:59.885
And be careful.

09:00.685 --> 09:03.645
You be careful.
Stay away from Francesco Pazzi.

09:04.205 --> 09:05.805
We don't need any more trouble.

09:09.205 --> 09:10.125
[Man] Yaw!

09:10.685 --> 09:11.645
[horses neigh]

09:19.605 --> 09:20.885
Where have you been?

09:22.925 --> 09:23.965
Does it matter?

09:28.885 --> 09:30.325
Lorenzo wanted to talk to you.

09:31.285 --> 09:32.165
About what?

09:36.325 --> 09:37.165
Didn't say.

09:46.405 --> 09:47.565
[knocking on door]

09:50.485 --> 09:51.485
[door opens]

09:56.405 --> 09:58.325
[Jacopo] I need action, not excuses!

09:58.405 --> 10:00.045
[Francesco]
I've done as you've asked, Uncle.

10:01.725 --> 10:03.725
[Jacopo] You're either a liar or a fool.

10:03.805 --> 10:05.645
You've done nothing of the kind.

10:08.085 --> 10:10.645
I asked you to stop Lorenzo de' Medici

10:10.725 --> 10:13.005
and this is what you bring me?
Half measures!

10:13.085 --> 10:14.645
-Uncle.
-What's happened?
Lorenzo is riding to Rome.

10:16.885 --> 10:18.525
Seeking credit from Pope Paul.

10:18.685 --> 10:21.405
Now is our time to strike a blow.

10:21.485 --> 10:23.685
Uncle, cousin Salviati
is an aide to the curia.

10:23.765 --> 10:26.325
It is the Pope who makes
the decisions, not the Curia!

10:26.405 --> 10:27.885
But the Curia influences the Pope.

10:28.485 --> 10:30.525
And our cousin influences the Curia.

10:30.605 --> 10:33.805
His influence is no match
for Lorenzo's silver tongue.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.565
Lorenzo's clever, yes.

10:37.445 --> 10:40.445
But inexperienced, he could be defeated.

10:42.365 --> 10:43.725
Why must we defeat him?

10:48.165 --> 10:49.685
How dare you ask such a thing?

10:52.245 --> 10:54.205
The Medici have been given a reprieve,

10:54.965 --> 10:56.365
thanks to the Priori,

10:56.965 --> 10:58.205
thanks to you.

10:58.725 --> 11:01.485
Our father believed
that Florence was stronger united.

11:01.685 --> 11:03.045
Your father is dead.

11:04.965 --> 11:09.925
I make the decisions now and I say
what benefits the enemy, harms us.

11:11.285 --> 11:13.965
We must not give the Medici an inch.

11:14.045 --> 11:15.085
And we won't.

11:16.525 --> 11:20.165
Whatever advantage Lorenzo seeks
from the Pope, Salviati will block it.

11:21.885 --> 11:24.405
The papal accounts are
the source of the Medici's power.

11:25.125 --> 11:26.765
And those accounts will be ours.

11:27.765 --> 11:29.525
Mark my words.

11:31.325 --> 11:32.325
They had better be.

11:39.165 --> 11:42.045
Do you think uncle was behind
the attack on Piero de' Medici.

11:42.285 --> 11:43.925
Would it trouble you if he was?

11:47.405 --> 11:50.685
You know our father
wanted peace, Francesco.

11:54.165 --> 11:55.925
He would have had it
if he'd lived long enough.

11:56.765 --> 12:01.725
Hey, our generation will end
the feud between our families.

12:02.445 --> 12:04.005
But on our terms.

12:05.925 --> 12:07.085
Not theirs.

12:10.405 --> 12:11.925
[bell tolling]

12:17.805 --> 12:19.405
[indistinct chatter]

12:20.125 --> 12:21.245
Rome's growing destitute.

12:21.645 --> 12:23.805
It is Florence that is growing prosperous.

12:24.445 --> 12:26.645
Thanks to your father and his father.

12:27.525 --> 12:29.885
Do the bankers of Rome
not care about their people?

12:30.405 --> 12:32.725
They use their people to enrich the bank.

12:33.765 --> 12:37.325
The Medici use their bank
to enrich the people.

12:38.965 --> 12:41.525
Are those the same people
that spit at father's name?

12:41.605 --> 12:42.565
No.

12:43.405 --> 12:46.405
Your father's final chapter
shall not end in defeat.

12:47.565 --> 12:48.565
And how do you know?

12:50.565 --> 12:52.765
Because you are to be its author.

13:14.325 --> 13:15.565
[man] Take some bread.

13:23.285 --> 13:24.885
Am I too late, Father Carlo?

13:25.405 --> 13:27.445
No, no, no, no, no. Come.

13:29.005 --> 13:30.045
She's right in here.

13:35.645 --> 13:36.765
I found your daughter.

13:37.125 --> 13:38.165
Has she come?

13:38.485 --> 13:39.965
Sh-She's with child but...

13:40.725 --> 13:43.165
she wanted me to tell you
that she forgives you, Ma donna.

13:44.045 --> 13:45.765
Your daughter knows that you love her.

13:46.605 --> 13:49.165
If her child is a girl,
she's going to name her after you.

13:53.885 --> 13:54.885
[woman] Thank you.

13:55.765 --> 13:56.685
Thank you.

14:15.445 --> 14:17.525
[Carlo] You did her
a great service, Clarice.

14:18.405 --> 14:19.925
There are so many who suffer.

14:21.525 --> 14:22.525
I wish I could do more.

14:24.365 --> 14:25.565
If you do as much.

14:31.885 --> 14:32.845
Father?

14:35.285 --> 14:37.445
I wish to lead a life like yours
and my brothers.

14:39.765 --> 14:41.445
You mean, take holy orders?

14:44.885 --> 14:46.325
That's a very great decision.

14:47.325 --> 14:48.365
There's no way back.

14:49.045 --> 14:51.325
And I-I doubt very much
if your family would approve.

14:51.605 --> 14:52.685
I'm sure they wouldn't but

14:53.205 --> 14:54.725
it is my decision to make.

14:55.285 --> 14:56.165
Hm.

14:56.565 --> 14:59.165
Perhaps, you could help them
to understand.

15:01.765 --> 15:02.685
Perhaps.

15:05.245 --> 15:07.805
But I must leave you now,
my nephew's due from Florence.

15:07.885 --> 15:09.085
Father Carlo,

15:09.165 --> 15:11.045
surely you're too young to have a nephew.

15:11.805 --> 15:14.365
Lorenzo's like a brother,
we're the same age
but my father, Cosimo,
was his grandfather.

15:17.085 --> 15:17.965
His grandfather?

15:19.365 --> 15:20.525
My mother was a slave.

15:21.685 --> 15:24.205
But the Medici took me into their home
and raised me as one of their own.

15:26.485 --> 15:28.885
Such extraordinary people
you Florentines are.

15:30.805 --> 15:32.085
Yes, I suppose we are.

15:46.085 --> 15:47.525
Lorenzo!

15:48.605 --> 15:49.845
Carlo.

15:51.165 --> 15:52.125
[both sigh]

15:53.645 --> 15:55.565
-You look well, don't you, Lorenzo?
-[laughs]

15:56.885 --> 15:58.925
How's Giuliano and Bianca?

15:59.005 --> 16:00.965
Very well, very well.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.805
And mother can't wait to see you.

16:03.205 --> 16:04.365
And I her.

16:05.125 --> 16:07.405
And what of your father?

16:08.965 --> 16:13.285
He's recovering, from blows
both physical and emotional.

16:14.325 --> 16:18.525
Well, look. Your father knows that
you're a good and loving son, Lorenzo.

16:19.325 --> 16:21.205
He will take comfort in that, trust me.

16:22.605 --> 16:25.485
No, I think he'll be more comforted
knowing the bank is saved, Carlo.

16:27.205 --> 16:29.165
-Hm. Ready?
-Mm-hmm.

16:30.045 --> 16:31.405
[exhales]

16:39.765 --> 16:41.485
Your Holiness.

16:42.805 --> 16:45.565
Ah. Lorenzo de' Medici.

16:46.685 --> 16:48.165
Your Holiness.

16:50.925 --> 16:54.925
I'm cardinal Orsini and
this is cardinal della Rovere.

16:55.925 --> 16:59.125
I believe you know Francesco Salviati.

17:00.365 --> 17:04.245
I know his cousins, the Pazzi,
but we've never met.

17:07.325 --> 17:10.445
My uncle, Carlo,
speaks very highly of Your Eminences'.

17:11.005 --> 17:15.525
My uncle, Jacopo,
warns me that you are skilled with words.

17:18.124 --> 17:21.124
I'm as good as my word, Salviati,
that much is true.

17:22.925 --> 17:27.445
Messer de' Medici has traveled
a long way to see Your Holiness.

17:28.005 --> 17:31.525
-We'll excuse ourselves.
-Uh, don't bother.

17:32.844 --> 17:33.965
Your Holiness?

17:34.525 --> 17:39.125
Well I'm sorry to say you've come all
this way for nothing, Messer de' Medici.

17:39.285 --> 17:41.925
I've already been told the question
you came to ask.

17:42.845 --> 17:45.845
And you can save your fine words.

17:46.725 --> 17:49.965
The answer is quite simply no.

17:51.245 --> 17:54.205
If you do not pay
the Holy Mother Church at once,

17:54.325 --> 17:56.765
you will lose the papal accounts.

17:59.285 --> 18:03.045
My family have served the holy seasons
from the time of my great-grandfather--

18:03.165 --> 18:05.565
Precisely, young Medici.

18:06.205 --> 18:11.125
Your bank serves this church
not the other way around.

18:15.805 --> 18:19.085
Come, gentlemen. We have
more important matters to attend to.

18:30.165 --> 18:33.525
When are you and your mother
heading back to Florence, Lorenzo?

18:33.765 --> 18:36.685
With the Pope's refusal,
we must return at once.

18:37.485 --> 18:38.645
Stay.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.885
-At least for another night.
-Your Eminence?

18:42.325 --> 18:44.925
Cardinal Orsini is hosting a banquet.

18:45.845 --> 18:48.725
-Come as my guests.
-I-I appreciate your invitation.

18:48.805 --> 18:50.645
Your mother will understand.

18:51.565 --> 18:52.845
See you this evening.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.445
Well, this is marvelous, Sandro.

19:03.525 --> 19:06.405
Uh, a worthless tournament banner
soon to be forgotten.

19:06.485 --> 19:11.445
They proclaim the greatness of Florence
and your technique... flawless.

19:11.525 --> 19:14.125
Yeah, well, my self respect
allows no less.

19:14.205 --> 19:16.365
I'm afraid this is not art,
Giuliano, it is craft.

19:16.445 --> 19:17.925
Sandro, this is undeniably art.

19:18.285 --> 19:20.245
Art doesn't want to tell people
what they want to hear,

19:20.325 --> 19:21.645
it tells them the truth.

19:21.805 --> 19:23.005
The truth? And what is that?
God, of course.

19:25.325 --> 19:27.205
-People cannot see God.
-No.

19:28.165 --> 19:31.685
But they can see his beauty
and I mean to show it.

19:31.765 --> 19:33.965
Mm. How you gonna do that?

19:37.365 --> 19:39.525
-No bloody Idea.
-[laughs]

19:40.765 --> 19:41.885
Well.

19:42.205 --> 19:44.845
I could use a drink. How 'bout you?

19:46.165 --> 19:48.285
-I have to drop this off.
-What is it?

19:48.365 --> 19:52.605
Another worthless commission
for another vulgar merchant, Vespucci.

19:54.645 --> 19:55.805
Hm.

19:56.085 --> 19:57.605
Newest member of the restricted council.

19:58.925 --> 20:00.085
I'll come with you.

20:01.565 --> 20:02.845
Suit yourself.

20:23.085 --> 20:24.245
Father.

20:24.325 --> 20:28.045
"For what shall it profit a man,
shall he gain the whole world.

20:28.285 --> 20:30.085
And lose his own soul?"

20:31.365 --> 20:32.925
You've hardly lost your soul.

20:33.005 --> 20:34.285
Perhaps.

20:34.685 --> 20:38.885
But I might have done
if my own son hadn't acted against me.

20:39.205 --> 20:43.525
[sighs] You mustn't fill your head
with regrets when you're not well.

20:44.245 --> 20:46.765
Come let me help you back to bed.

20:49.365 --> 20:54.045
My father thought I had a head for books,
not for the affairs of men.

20:54.925 --> 20:57.165
I tried to prove him wrong my whole life.

20:58.845 --> 21:01.045
Only to prove him right.

21:02.725 --> 21:04.125
Now rest.

21:05.405 --> 21:07.485
Soon you will be back to your old self.

21:07.565 --> 21:09.525
I'll never be that man again.

21:10.525 --> 21:13.325
I see clearly now, I never was.

21:14.885 --> 21:16.125
[footsteps]

21:16.685 --> 21:18.165
[knocking on door]

21:19.325 --> 21:21.005
Bastiano Soderini is here.

21:21.205 --> 21:24.285
Father's not receiving visitors,
send him away.

21:24.565 --> 21:25.925
But Ma donna,

21:26.365 --> 21:28.685
-he wishes to see you.
-Me?

21:30.445 --> 21:31.845
Whatever for?

21:33.365 --> 21:34.645
[footsteps]

21:35.565 --> 21:37.565
[exhales] Bianca.

21:40.085 --> 21:43.485
You look beautiful as ever.

21:45.525 --> 21:49.485
Your visit is unexpected, Bastiano,
and my father needs my ministrations.

21:49.565 --> 21:52.885
You are as loving and devoted
a daughter as you shall be a wife.

21:55.245 --> 21:59.405
Thank you, but I don't see
what concern that is of yours.

21:59.725 --> 22:02.965
I know we can't say anything
until your brother returns from Rome.

22:03.605 --> 22:06.285
But I can contain
my excitement no longer.

22:07.205 --> 22:08.685
What on Earth are you talking about?

22:09.245 --> 22:10.685
Our engagement, of course.
Our engagement?

22:14.685 --> 22:16.685
Surely you were told?
Yes, of course.

22:28.325 --> 22:30.405
-[horses neigh]
-[man grunts]

22:31.805 --> 22:34.125
Did you scratch that? Did you?

22:34.245 --> 22:35.445
Messer?

22:36.285 --> 22:38.645
This costs more than you'll earn
in 10 lifetimes.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.805
Ah, his poor mother.
[louder] Messer Vespucci.

22:40.885 --> 22:41.805
I-I didn't damage it.

22:41.885 --> 22:43.805
Botticelli, at last.

22:44.245 --> 22:45.125
Carry on.

22:45.205 --> 22:48.325
Messer Vespucci, may I introduce you
to Giuliano de' Medici?

22:48.565 --> 22:49.605
Messer Medici.

22:52.485 --> 22:53.405
I was beginning to think

22:53.485 --> 22:56.685
-I'd never see you again, Botticelli.
-It's only been a month, Messer.

23:00.205 --> 23:01.525
Hand it over then.

23:01.605 --> 23:04.485
Gladly, once I receive my florins.

23:06.965 --> 23:09.045
Surely you don't think
I'd withhold payment.

23:09.125 --> 23:11.605
I'm a mere artist, Messer,
I can't afford to wait.

23:13.445 --> 23:14.445
[clears throat]

23:14.885 --> 23:16.165
Very well.
[horses neigh]

23:21.525 --> 23:22.845
[man] Hold!

23:35.325 --> 23:37.245
Allow me, Ma donna.

23:42.405 --> 23:44.565
-[Giuliano] May I?
-Thank you.

23:45.445 --> 23:46.805
-Messer?
-Medici.

23:47.405 --> 23:48.925
Giuliano de' Medici.

23:49.085 --> 23:51.405
-And my name is Sandro Botticelli.
-And your name?
[Vespucci] Simonetta, at last.

23:57.725 --> 24:00.485
I see you gentlemen have met my wife.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.005
Your wife.

24:03.485 --> 24:04.685
Your florins.

24:04.805 --> 24:05.845
[coins jangle]

24:06.045 --> 24:07.245
My painting.

24:08.445 --> 24:09.525
Come, Simonetta.

24:14.565 --> 24:16.565
[Giuliano]
She can't be married to that fool.

24:16.765 --> 24:17.925
She is.

24:19.205 --> 24:20.565
She's beautiful.

24:23.605 --> 24:24.805
She's more than that.

24:25.245 --> 24:26.725
[thunder rumbling]

24:34.925 --> 24:36.165
Lorenzo, well?

24:37.205 --> 24:39.245
The cardinals wouldn't even listen
to what I have to say.

24:40.685 --> 24:43.445
And Salviati just smiles in contempt.

24:44.085 --> 24:45.845
There must be something you can do.

24:47.485 --> 24:49.285
No, perhaps father was right.

24:49.725 --> 24:52.725
Perhaps the only way to save Florence...
is to let Sforza burn it.

24:52.805 --> 24:54.565
No, you don't believe that.

24:56.165 --> 24:57.285
Maddalena,

25:00.125 --> 25:03.165
May I introduce you to my son, Lorenzo?

25:03.325 --> 25:04.365
Lorenzo.

25:05.285 --> 25:06.765
This is my daughter Clarice.

25:07.805 --> 25:09.365
And you know Father Carlo.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.125
I'm his great admirer.

25:12.325 --> 25:14.085
I saw you this afternoon.

25:14.805 --> 25:18.485
-Did you?
-In Trastevere, at the almshouse?

25:18.965 --> 25:22.365
[Carlo] Ah, yes, Clarice devotes
many hours to the poor and the destitute.

25:23.125 --> 25:26.045
I understand you're a patron of the arts.

25:26.125 --> 25:30.685
Yes! I love the arts, I love philosophy
and poetry... [inhales]

25:31.525 --> 25:34.285
-Any of the higher callings.
-The higher callings?

25:36.325 --> 25:40.245
[stutters] Well, I don't just mean
the higher callings, I like...

25:40.965 --> 25:43.965
horse riding, uh,
all forms of sport, uh...

25:47.165 --> 25:49.005
I suppose I like everything, really.

25:53.205 --> 25:57.245
And my family, obviously,
provide for the poor in Florence,

25:57.325 --> 25:59.245
they-they give generously, actually.

25:59.645 --> 26:02.125
Father Carlo speaks
very fondly of you, Messer.

26:03.045 --> 26:04.125
It was a pleasure to meet you.

26:12.485 --> 26:13.485
[exhales]

26:14.525 --> 26:17.365
It seems the lady
and I have different interests.

26:17.885 --> 26:21.285
Hm. What does that matter
when your uncle is cardinal Orsini?

26:22.285 --> 26:24.805
-I fail to see how that--
-Clarice has a noble title.

26:24.925 --> 26:28.165
-She has influence in Rome.
-Mother.

26:29.125 --> 26:31.005
You're not suggesting marriage, are you?

26:31.925 --> 26:35.005
Orsini may prevail upon the Pope
to extend us credit,

26:35.085 --> 26:37.885
if... you were married to his niece.

26:39.645 --> 26:41.365
[indistinct murmur]

26:42.885 --> 26:45.525
And you've already spoken
to cardinal della Rovere about this.

26:45.845 --> 26:48.365
I told you I had other business
in Rome to attend to.

26:48.445 --> 26:50.045
[Carlo] There is a problem though.

26:50.685 --> 26:55.485
I've known the lady for quite sometime,
she's very devoted and

26:55.565 --> 26:58.485
just this morning, she informed me
that she means to become a nun.

26:59.685 --> 27:00.645
Hmm.

27:01.285 --> 27:02.525
That is an obstacle.

27:03.405 --> 27:08.365
Although perhaps, not one insurmountable
to a young man of your charms.

27:11.045 --> 27:12.605
[man laughing]

27:13.605 --> 27:14.445
Well, Lorenzo...

27:14.925 --> 27:15.805
what say you?

27:17.965 --> 27:18.805
Ah.

27:19.325 --> 27:20.285
It's worth a try.

27:21.645 --> 27:24.925
[Carlo] So, you mean to turn Clarice away
from her devotions?

27:25.245 --> 27:26.205
Well,

27:27.005 --> 27:29.245
it seems like our family,
and Florence depend on it...

27:30.965 --> 27:31.845
Uncle.

27:49.045 --> 27:51.685
I feel like I owe you an apology.

27:52.925 --> 27:53.845
For what?

27:55.085 --> 27:59.205
What must seem like utter shallowness
to a woman of your depth...

28:01.125 --> 28:03.165
I know you are not shallow, Lorenzo.

28:04.525 --> 28:05.605
But you...

28:06.485 --> 28:08.525
value things of this world and I do not.

28:12.445 --> 28:15.405
Is the world not God's creation?

28:17.685 --> 28:20.445
Forgive me, but I'm the wrong person
to engage in debate.

28:23.325 --> 28:25.365
The unfortunate that you minister to,

28:26.845 --> 28:28.005
if they could, would they not...

28:29.085 --> 28:31.725
want to see the beauty
the world has to offer.

28:32.645 --> 28:34.125
What is your point, Lorenzo?

28:37.445 --> 28:40.925
We serve God by aiding those in need
but we also serve him by...

28:41.805 --> 28:44.405
recognizing the beauty
of the world he created.

28:46.845 --> 28:48.165
And we noble others

28:50.085 --> 28:51.685
by allowing them to see it, too.

28:53.605 --> 28:55.805
It's true what they say,
you are good with words.

28:57.925 --> 29:00.725
Well, they are more than words, Clarice.

29:05.325 --> 29:07.725
You are aware that our mothers
have spoken of marriage?

29:08.845 --> 29:09.805
I'm aware.

29:11.405 --> 29:12.445
I beg you...

29:14.605 --> 29:16.365
Look favorably on the proposal.

29:17.925 --> 29:20.645
Because your family is powerful
and mine has noble blood?

29:21.765 --> 29:23.685
Um, because if you give me your heart...

29:25.045 --> 29:26.605
I promise before God

29:27.125 --> 29:28.405
I will take care of it.

29:29.245 --> 29:30.965
You don't even know me, Lorenzo.

29:31.205 --> 29:32.565
You mustn't make such promises.

29:32.645 --> 29:34.245
No, I-- I do not know you.

29:36.205 --> 29:38.125
And you do not know me
and you do not love me.

29:40.525 --> 29:41.845
In time you would.
And I would love you...

29:46.325 --> 29:47.645
with all that I am

29:49.005 --> 29:50.405
and all that I will ever be.

29:59.165 --> 30:01.445
[thunder rumbling]

30:04.165 --> 30:06.645
If anyone could persuade me to marry,
perhaps it would be you.

30:10.205 --> 30:11.205
But no one can.

30:27.565 --> 30:29.165
[thunder rumbling]

30:41.525 --> 30:44.085
-It's from cousin Salviati in Rome.
-I know that.

30:44.525 --> 30:45.605
What does it say?

30:46.165 --> 30:48.325
Pope has stood firm against Lorenzo.

30:50.085 --> 30:50.925
He's failed.

30:52.205 --> 30:54.405
And Lorenzo overthrew his father
for naught?

30:55.125 --> 30:57.485
It's just a matter of time
before he loses the papal account

30:57.565 --> 30:58.805
and the Medici are bankrupt.

31:00.725 --> 31:02.725
[bell clanging]

31:16.685 --> 31:17.645
[Giuliano] Brother?

31:18.405 --> 31:19.405
How did it go?
Disastrous.

31:21.685 --> 31:23.805
-It's a total failure.
-You're ruined.

31:24.685 --> 31:26.205
And mother has stayed behind

31:26.485 --> 31:28.245
in hopes of negotiating my marriage,

31:29.005 --> 31:30.205
to Clarice Orsini.

31:30.765 --> 31:32.805
I once met her. She is very beautiful.

31:33.205 --> 31:34.125
[Bianca] Lorenzo?

31:35.085 --> 31:36.605
Ah. Bianca.

31:37.205 --> 31:38.245
I want to just--

31:39.965 --> 31:43.165
You promised my hand in marriage
without so much as asking me?

31:45.725 --> 31:48.085
Bastiano Soderini is a good match.

31:48.605 --> 31:51.285
-And one that benefits our family.
-He's not my choice.

31:51.365 --> 31:52.445
What does that matter?

31:53.405 --> 31:56.125
Um, mother intends me to marry
some noble woman from Rome.

31:56.205 --> 31:57.485
She's not of my choosing either.

31:58.005 --> 31:59.085
But she is very beautiful.

32:00.285 --> 32:01.125
Giuliano.
Hmm.

32:03.325 --> 32:05.605
I do not want to marry Bastiano.

32:05.925 --> 32:07.125
And that's the end of it.

32:09.885 --> 32:10.805
Bianca.

32:14.525 --> 32:16.045
[birds chirping]

32:16.725 --> 32:19.085
[bell clanging]

32:20.885 --> 32:21.725
Well?

32:22.205 --> 32:25.005
Cardinal may support
the marriage and our bank,

32:25.525 --> 32:29.885
if we install Clarice's brother Rinaldo
as archbishop of Florence.

32:31.445 --> 32:32.565
Then you have a deal.

32:33.885 --> 32:36.765
Clarice still insists on taking her vows.

32:38.245 --> 32:39.685
And how can you change her mind?

32:40.325 --> 32:41.205
I can't.

32:46.285 --> 32:47.525
You expect me to do it.

32:48.405 --> 32:52.005
Her mother tells me Clarice respects you
more than anyone else in the world.

32:52.965 --> 32:54.685
I cannot turn her away from God.

32:56.885 --> 32:58.125
I understand, Carlo.

32:58.285 --> 32:59.965
-[Carlo sighs]
-And if you cannot bring yourself

33:00.085 --> 33:02.005
to champion this family
then I will forgive you.

33:06.365 --> 33:08.965
But it will require forgiveness.

33:21.885 --> 33:24.445
[birds chirping]

33:40.085 --> 33:41.405
I missed you.

34:10.885 --> 34:13.925
You know, you quite rightly...

34:15.445 --> 34:18.204
You'll be the queen of the tournament,
Ma donna Ardinghelli.

34:21.724 --> 34:23.885
Why, thank you, Messer Medici.

34:24.365 --> 34:25.684
-My pleasure.
-Hmm.

34:29.845 --> 34:33.085
Did you ever think how different things
might have been for us?

34:33.724 --> 34:34.644
What do you mean?

34:37.085 --> 34:39.204
Well, if I was born to more money...

34:42.525 --> 34:43.845
or you to less...

34:44.605 --> 34:46.125
we could had ended up together.

34:47.965 --> 34:48.885
Maybe.

34:50.244 --> 34:54.125
But as it is, my mother wants me
to marry into one of nobility.

34:57.005 --> 34:58.005
Marry?

35:00.605 --> 35:02.085
Now that I'm head of the family.

35:07.165 --> 35:09.245
And you didn't think to tell me that
before we made love?

35:10.925 --> 35:11.965
Does it bother you?

35:12.485 --> 35:14.805
-Why wouldn't it?
-Because you're already married.

35:14.885 --> 35:16.565
Yes, but to a husband I do not love.

35:16.645 --> 35:18.965
Yeah, well, I don't love
my intended, either, do I?

35:19.845 --> 35:21.245
I-- I hardly know her.

35:21.325 --> 35:24.165
If you marry her,
things between us will change.

35:24.405 --> 35:25.565
They don't have to.

35:27.325 --> 35:28.365
They don't have to.

35:31.765 --> 35:32.725
Leave.

35:37.205 --> 35:38.365
Lucrezia, what did I say?

35:39.325 --> 35:40.325
Please go.

36:10.965 --> 36:13.125
[indistinct chatter]

36:14.405 --> 36:16.365
[chickens clucking]

36:31.365 --> 36:32.205
Father.

36:33.165 --> 36:34.245
Is everything all right?

36:35.405 --> 36:37.685
[sighs] Fine, fine.

36:41.005 --> 36:42.965
You've been speaking to Ma donna Medici.

36:44.365 --> 36:46.685
She wants you to persuade me
to marry Lorenzo.

36:48.765 --> 36:49.605
Yes.

36:52.325 --> 36:53.325
But you refused.

36:58.205 --> 36:59.245
Did you refuse?

37:04.045 --> 37:05.325
Clarice, are you...

37:05.685 --> 37:09.725
truly prepared to give up
on the possibility of being a mother?

37:11.485 --> 37:15.245
At having someone to love
and care for you?

37:15.765 --> 37:17.605
To serve God is a privilege, Father.

37:18.005 --> 37:22.845
Yes, but there are ways to serve God
that do not demand such sacrifices.

37:22.925 --> 37:25.405
Surely not by marrying Lorenzo de' Medici.

37:28.325 --> 37:29.405
The Medici...

37:30.205 --> 37:31.885
are a family like no other.

37:33.285 --> 37:35.125
They have changed Florence.

37:36.605 --> 37:41.405
And I believe that Lorenzo has it in him
to change the world.

37:44.485 --> 37:47.805
And if he fails
because you refused to take his hand

37:48.405 --> 37:51.605
the cost will be borne
by generations to come.

37:55.525 --> 37:57.485
So, serve this family, Clarice.

37:59.605 --> 38:00.885
And you serve God.

38:03.765 --> 38:04.685
[woman] Father?

38:04.845 --> 38:06.565
-You are needed.
-Fine.

38:25.925 --> 38:27.565
[crickets chirping]

38:40.725 --> 38:41.685
Father.

38:51.085 --> 38:52.285
I've returned from Rome.

38:53.445 --> 38:56.125
Hmm, did your mother find you a bride?

38:58.485 --> 38:59.565
You knew about that.

39:00.365 --> 39:02.445
We discussed it before she left.

39:03.365 --> 39:05.125
She's trying, but...

39:07.005 --> 39:10.245
the woman in question
wishes to take her spiritual vows.
And it's only a matter of days
before we are insolvent.

39:20.645 --> 39:22.005
Grandmother used to say...

39:23.085 --> 39:24.485
that if we lose today...

39:26.125 --> 39:27.965
we must have faith
that we will win tomorrow.

39:29.405 --> 39:31.365
It's a noble thought.

39:35.325 --> 39:36.725
I'm the joust in the tournament.

39:40.965 --> 39:42.885
I'll wear the families colors with pride.

39:47.485 --> 39:49.525
I'm sorry, Father. I'm sorry.

39:53.125 --> 39:55.525
I had hoped to write
a happy ending for you.

39:56.085 --> 39:59.525
A man is the author
of his own life, Lorenzo.

40:01.165 --> 40:03.405
Surely a man's life
does not end with his own.

40:06.605 --> 40:07.845
Not if he has a son.

40:15.205 --> 40:17.285
Then prove your grandmother right.

40:18.245 --> 40:19.765
Win the joust,

40:20.285 --> 40:22.205
bring me the silver helmet.

40:24.085 --> 40:24.965
Hmm?

41:03.485 --> 41:04.605
Where have you been hiding?

41:05.565 --> 41:06.925
Careful, Francesco,

41:07.685 --> 41:09.365
you don't want to pick a fight
without your thugs around

41:09.445 --> 41:10.725
to do the actual fighting.

41:11.605 --> 41:13.965
The finals will pit the Medici
against the Pazzi.

41:15.005 --> 41:16.725
First you will ride against my brother.

41:18.205 --> 41:19.965
I came to wish you good luck, actually.
-You're going to need it.
-Hmm.

41:25.845 --> 41:27.485
[horse neighing]

41:28.005 --> 41:29.885
You know he's gonna try
and kill you, don't you?

41:31.165 --> 41:32.565
He was last year's champion.

41:33.285 --> 41:35.405
I told Father I'd win
that silver helmet.

41:36.525 --> 41:37.405
And I will.

41:37.485 --> 41:39.085
[crowd cheering]

41:40.445 --> 41:42.645
Are those the young men
who were at the palazzo?

41:42.725 --> 41:44.845
[Vespucci] The Medici
are arrogant peacocks.

41:45.525 --> 41:46.765
They like to be seen.

41:49.925 --> 41:52.725
[announcer] Guglielmo Pazzi
and Giuliano de' Medici

41:53.005 --> 41:54.405
take your horses.

It's a draw.

42:50.045 --> 42:53.805
-[drums rolling]
-[crowd cheering]

43:01.325 --> 43:03.765
You're a far better rider
than me, Giuliano.

43:05.085 --> 43:06.045
You could have killed me.

43:07.805 --> 43:08.925
Yes, I could have.

43:10.765 --> 43:12.525
But my sister would've never forgiven me.

43:22.965 --> 43:23.925
Bad luck, Giuliano.

43:24.565 --> 43:25.965
[woman] Better luck next time.

43:26.045 --> 43:28.445
Seems he was too good for me.
Up to you now, brother.

43:34.645 --> 43:36.445
You must defeat Lorenzo.

43:37.885 --> 43:39.285
Don't worry, Uncle.

43:40.525 --> 43:41.365
I will.

43:50.725 --> 43:52.045
Make sure of it.

43:56.805 --> 43:59.725
[man] Francesco Pazzi
and Lorenzo de' Medici...

44:00.605 --> 44:02.485
in the first of the three rounds.

You'll get him this time, brother.

[Lorenzo screaming]

45:23.165 --> 45:24.725
[man] Lorenzo, are you all right?

45:33.485 --> 45:35.165
They cut it. I told you.

45:43.805 --> 45:45.565
[Francesco]
He's going to ride without his armor.

45:47.565 --> 45:49.085
You did something to his saddle.

45:50.365 --> 45:51.845
-Perhaps.
-Perhaps?

45:52.605 --> 45:54.365
[man] We could have him arrested.

45:54.485 --> 45:55.725
If we could prove that he did it.

45:58.485 --> 45:59.605
You want me to kill him?

46:00.565 --> 46:01.525
I'll kill him.

46:02.685 --> 46:03.765
But in a fair fight.
