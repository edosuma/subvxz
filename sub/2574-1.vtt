01:55.241 --> 01:57.702
It is an extremely
common mistake,

01:57.911 --> 02:01.080
people think the writer's
imagination is always at work,

02:01.289 --> 02:03.917
that he's constantly
inventing an endless supply

02:04.876 --> 02:06.085
of incidents and episodes,

02:06.169 --> 02:09.964
that he simply dreams up
his stories out of thin air.

02:10.173 --> 02:12.842
In point of fact,
the opposite is true.

02:13.051 --> 02:15.011
Once the public
knows you're a writer,

02:15.219 --> 02:17.889
they bring the characters
and events to you

02:18.097 --> 02:20.767
and as long as you maintain
your ability to look

02:20.975 --> 02:23.311
and to carefully listen,

02:23.519 --> 02:26.105
these stories
will continue to...

02:26.314 --> 02:28.900
Stop it. Stop it! Don't! Don't do it!

02:33.947 --> 02:38.576
Uh, will continue to seek
you out over your lifetime.

02:38.785 --> 02:42.121
To him who has often
told the tales of others,

02:42.330 --> 02:43.957
many tales will be told.

02:44.165 --> 02:45.917
Sorry.
It's all right.

02:46.125 --> 02:49.170
The incidents that follow
were described to me

02:49.379 --> 02:52.382
exactly as I present them here

02:52.590 --> 02:54.968
and in a wholly unexpected way.

03:02.558 --> 03:03.768
<i>A number of years ago,</i>

03:03.977 --> 03:06.854
<i>while suffering from a mild
case of "Scribe's Fever,"</i>

03:07.063 --> 03:08.856
a <i>form of neurasthenia
common among</i>

03:08.982 --> 03:10.775
<i>the intelligentsia of that time,</i>

03:10.984 --> 03:12.860
<i>I decided to spend
the month of August</i>

03:13.069 --> 03:16.990
<i>in the spa town of Nebelsbad
below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz,</i>

03:17.198 --> 03:20.535
<i>and had taken up rooms
in the Grand Budapest,</i>

03:20.743 --> 03:25.581
<i>a picturesque, elaborate, and once
widely celebrated establishment.</i>

03:25.790 --> 03:28.334
<i>I expect some of
you will know it.</i>

03:30.086 --> 03:33.339
<i>YOUNG</i> WRITER: <i>It was off season and, by
that time, decidedly out of fashion,</i>

03:33.423 --> 03:35.466
<i>and it had already
begun its descent</i>

03:35.675 --> 03:39.679
<i>into shabbiness and
eventual demolition.</i>

03:39.887 --> 03:41.597
<i>What few guests we were</i>

03:41.806 --> 03:44.142
<i>had quickly come to recognize
one another by sight</i>

03:44.350 --> 03:47.395
<i>as the only living souls residing
in the vast establishment,</i>

03:48.646 --> 03:51.649
<i>although I do not believe any acquaintance
among our number had proceeded</i>

03:51.858 --> 03:54.736
<i>beyond the polite nods
we exchanged as we passed</i>

03:54.819 --> 03:55.820
<i>in the Palm Court,</i>

03:56.029 --> 03:57.864
<i>in the Arabian baths,</i>

03:58.072 --> 04:00.241
<i>and on board
the Colonnade Funicular.</i>

04:00.450 --> 04:03.327
We were a very reserved
group, <i>it</i> seemed,

04:03.536 --> 04:05.997
<i>and, without exception,
solitary.</i>

04:10.334 --> 04:13.129
<i>Perhaps as a result of
this general silence,</i>

04:13.337 --> 04:16.132
<i>I had established a casual
and bantering familiarity</i>

04:16.339 --> 04:18.341
<i>with the hotel's concierge,
a West-continental</i>

04:18.551 --> 04:20.553
<i>known only as Monsieur Jean,</i>

04:20.762 --> 04:22.597
<i>who struck one
as being, at once,</i>

04:22.680 --> 04:25.933
<i>both lazy and, really,
quite accommodating.</i>

04:26.100 --> 04:28.311
<i>I expect he was not well paid.</i>

04:28.519 --> 04:29.937
In any case, one evening,

04:30.146 --> 04:32.607
<i>as I stood conferring
elbow-to-elbow with Monsieur Jean,</i>

04:32.815 --> 04:37.153
<i>as had become my habit, I noticed
a new presence in our company.</i>

04:37.361 --> 04:39.739
<i>A small, elderly man,
smartly dressed,</i>

04:39.947 --> 04:42.867
<i>with an exceptionally lively,
intelligent face</i>

04:43.076 --> 04:46.079
<i>and an immediately perceptible
air of sadness.</i>

04:46.287 --> 04:49.665
<i>He was, like the rest of us,
alone, but also, I must say,</i>

04:49.874 --> 04:54.420
<i>he was the first that struck one
as being deeply and truly lonely.</i>

04:54.629 --> 04:57.298
<i>A symptom of my own
medical condition as well.</i>

04:57.507 --> 04:59.383
Who's this interesting
old fellow?

04:59.592 --> 05:01.177
<i>I inquired of Monsieur Jean.</i>

05:01.385 --> 05:04.013
<i>To my surprise,
he was distinctly taken aback.</i>

05:04.222 --> 05:05.473
Don't you know?
He <i>asked.</i>

05:05.681 --> 05:07.433
Don't you recognize him?

05:07.642 --> 05:09.018
<i>He did look familiar.</i>

05:09.227 --> 05:11.312
That's Mr. Moustafa himself.

05:11.395 --> 05:12.939
He arrived earlier this morning.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.358
<i>This name will no
doubt be familiar</i>

05:15.483 --> 05:18.236
<i>to the more seasoned
persons among you.</i>

05:20.488 --> 05:24.909
<i>Mr. Zero Moustafa was at one time
the richest man in Zubrowka,</i>

05:26.661 --> 05:30.248
<i>and was still indeed the owner
of the Grand Budapest.</i>

05:31.541 --> 05:33.417
He often comes and
stays a week or more,

05:33.626 --> 05:35.753
three times a year at least,
but never in the season.

05:35.962 --> 05:38.297
<i>Monsieur Jean signaled to me
and I leaned closer.</i>

05:38.506 --> 05:39.549
I'll tell you a secret.

05:39.757 --> 05:42.093
He takes only a single-bed
sleeping room without a bath

05:42.301 --> 05:44.053
in the rear corner
of the top floor

05:44.262 --> 05:46.180
and it's smaller than
the service elevator!

05:46.389 --> 05:47.723
<i>It was well known,</i>

05:47.974 --> 05:50.476
<i>Zero Moustafa had purchased
and famously inhabited</i>

05:50.685 --> 05:53.604
<i>some of the most lavish castles
and palazzos on the continent.</i>

05:53.896 --> 05:57.108
<i>Yet here, in his own
nearly empty hotel,</i>

05:57.316 --> 05:59.819
<i>he occupied
a servant's quarters?</i>

06:00.319 --> 06:01.696
<i>At that moment, the curtain rose</i>

06:01.821 --> 06:03.281
<i>on a parenthetical,
domestic drama...</i>

06:03.489 --> 06:04.657
Shit.

06:04.866 --> 06:07.743
<i>Which required the immediate
and complete attention</i>

06:07.952 --> 06:09.912
of Monsieur Jean,

06:11.664 --> 06:14.125
<i>but, frankly,
did not hold mine for long.</i>

06:21.424 --> 06:22.425
However,

06:22.633 --> 06:25.261
<i>this premature intermission in the
story of the curious, old man</i>

06:25.469 --> 06:27.889
<i>had left me,
as the expression goes,</i>

06:28.097 --> 06:30.224
"gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen,"

06:30.433 --> 06:32.727
<i>that is, on the edge of my seat,</i>

06:32.935 --> 06:35.813
<i>where I remained throughout
the next morning, until,</i>

06:36.022 --> 06:39.775
<i>in what I have found to be its
mysterious and utterly reliable fashion,</i>

06:39.984 --> 06:43.863
<i>fate, once again,
intervened on my behalf.</i>

06:47.783 --> 06:49.785
MR. MOUSTAFA:
I admire your work.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.415
I beg your pardon?

06:56.167 --> 07:00.296
I said, I know and admire
your wonderful work.

07:01.297 --> 07:03.090
Thank you most kindly, sir.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.551
Did Monsieur Jean have a word
or two to share with you

07:05.635 --> 07:09.347
about the aged proprietor
of this establishment?

07:09.847 --> 07:14.060
I must confess, I did
myself inquire about you.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.854
He's perfectly capable,
of course, Monsieur Jean

07:17.063 --> 07:18.814
but we can't claim he's a first,

07:19.023 --> 07:21.692
or, in earnest,
even second-rate concierge.

07:21.776 --> 07:23.027
But there it is.

07:23.945 --> 07:25.738
Times have changed.

07:28.282 --> 07:31.953
The thermal baths
are very beautiful.

07:32.161 --> 07:33.704
They were in their
first condition.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.456
It couldn't be maintained,
of course.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.375
Too decadent for current tastes.

07:37.583 --> 07:42.255
But I love it all just the same,
this enchanting old ruin.

07:43.339 --> 07:45.883
How did you come to
buy it, if I may ask?

07:46.092 --> 07:48.094
The Grand Budapest.

07:57.853 --> 07:58.854
I didn't.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.324
If you're not
merely being polite,

08:10.533 --> 08:13.244
and you must tell me
if that's the case,

08:13.452 --> 08:16.455
but if it genuinely
does interest you,

08:16.664 --> 08:19.000
may I invite you to
dine with me tonight,

08:19.292 --> 08:23.004
and it will be my pleasure and,
indeed, my privilege to tell you

08:23.212 --> 08:26.632
"my story."
Such as it is.

08:32.888 --> 08:34.807
Two ducks roasted with olives.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.393
Rabbit, salad?
Mmm.

08:37.601 --> 08:40.313
Pouilly-Jouvet '52,
plus a split of the brut.

08:41.522 --> 08:44.650
That should
provide us ample time

08:44.859 --> 08:45.943
if I commence promptly.

08:46.068 --> 08:47.153
By all means.

09:07.048 --> 09:12.511
Well, it begins, as it must, with
our mutual friend's predecessor.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.931
The beloved, original concierge
of The Grand Budapest.

09:17.308 --> 09:19.393
It begins, of course, with...

09:41.624 --> 09:43.876
Bring the table to the window.
Yes, Monsieur Gustave.

09:44.085 --> 09:46.545
Bring the tray to the table.
Right away, Monsieur Gustave.

09:46.754 --> 09:49.090
Right there. Have those
been brushed and blocked?

09:49.298 --> 09:51.092
Of course, Monsieur Gustave.
Pack them in the hat boxes.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.496
Is that from
Oberstdorf & Company?

09:52.510 --> 09:53.469
I believe so, Monsieur Gustave.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.346
Second trunk. Who has the tickets?
I do, Monsieur Gustave.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.431
Give them to me.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.601
These are in order.
Wait in the corner.

10:08.818 --> 10:09.944
I'm not leaving.

10:10.069 --> 10:11.195
I beg your pardon?

10:11.404 --> 10:13.406
I'm not leaving.
Why not?

10:13.614 --> 10:15.533
I'm frightened.
Of what?

10:15.741 --> 10:17.942
I fear this may be the last
time we ever see each other.

10:18.077 --> 10:19.620
Why on earth would
that be the case?

10:19.829 --> 10:22.039
Well, I can't put it
into words, but I feel it.

10:22.248 --> 10:23.499
For goodness sake,
there's no reason

10:23.624 --> 10:24.864
for you to leave us if you'd...

10:25.000 --> 10:26.460
Come with me.

10:26.585 --> 10:28.045
To fucking Lutz?

10:28.254 --> 10:30.339
Please.
Give me your hand.

10:32.383 --> 10:35.469
You've nothing to fear. You're
always anxious before you travel.

10:35.553 --> 10:36.971
I admit, you appear
to be suffering

10:37.096 --> 10:38.536
a more acute attack
on this occasion.

10:38.556 --> 10:39.974
But, truly and honestly...
Oh, dear God.

10:40.099 --> 10:41.517
What have you done
to your fingernails?

10:41.600 --> 10:43.436
I beg your pardon? This
diabolical varnish.

10:43.561 --> 10:45.521
The color is completely wrong.
Don't you like it?

10:45.604 --> 10:48.524
It's not that I don't like it.
I am physically repulsed.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.068
Perhaps this will soothe you.

10:51.235 --> 10:52.820
What? Don't recite.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.228
Just listen to
the words. Hush.

10:54.238 --> 10:55.322
Please. Not now.

10:55.865 --> 10:59.410
"While questing once in noble
wood of gray, medieval pine,

10:59.618 --> 11:03.789
"I came upon a tomb, rain-slick'd,
rubbed-cool, ethereal,

11:03.998 --> 11:05.749
"'its inscription
long-vanished,

11:05.958 --> 11:08.377
"yet still within its
melancholy fissures..."

11:09.503 --> 11:11.463
MADAME D.: Will you light
a candle for me, please?

11:12.339 --> 11:14.049
In the sacristy of Santa Maria?

11:14.175 --> 11:15.935
GUSTAVE H: I'll see to it
myself immediately.

11:16.594 --> 11:20.014
Remember, I'm always with you.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.266
I love you.

11:22.433 --> 11:23.726
I love you.

11:35.446 --> 11:37.823
It's quite a thing winning the
loyalty of a woman like that

11:38.032 --> 11:40.034
for 19 consecutive seasons.

11:40.826 --> 11:42.203
Um... Yes, sir.

11:42.328 --> 11:44.163
She's very fond of me, you know.

11:44.330 --> 11:45.331
Yes, sir.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.458
But I've never seen
her like that before.

11:47.666 --> 11:48.667
No, sir.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.128
She was shaking
like a shitting dog.

11:52.546 --> 11:53.547
Truly.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.133
Run to the cathedral of Santa
Maria in Brucknerplatz.

11:56.342 --> 11:58.052
Buy one of the plain,
half-length candles

11:58.135 --> 11:59.615
and take back four
Klubecks in change.

11:59.803 --> 12:01.597
Light it in the sacristy,
say a brief rosary

12:01.805 --> 12:03.933
then go to Mendl's and get me
a courtesan au chocolat.

12:04.141 --> 12:06.741
If there's any money left, give it
to the crippled shoe-shine boy.

12:08.479 --> 12:09.480
Right away, sir.

12:09.605 --> 12:10.606
Hold it.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.652
Who are you?

12:14.777 --> 12:16.529
I'm Zero, sir.
The new Lobby Boy.

12:16.737 --> 12:17.947
Zero, you say?
Yes, sir.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.406
I've never heard of you,
never laid eyes on you.

12:19.490 --> 12:20.491
Who hired you?

12:20.699 --> 12:21.825
Mr. Mosher, sir.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.118
Mr. Mosher!

12:24.411 --> 12:25.454
Yes, Monsieur Gustave?

12:25.663 --> 12:28.290
Am I to understand you've
surreptitiously hired this young man

12:28.374 --> 12:29.667
in the position of a Lobby Boy?

12:29.875 --> 12:31.627
He's been engaged
for a trial period,

12:31.752 --> 12:33.462
pending your approval,
of course.

12:33.546 --> 12:34.838
Uh...

12:34.964 --> 12:37.341
Perhaps, yes.
Thank you, Mr. Mosher.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.802
You're most welcome,
Monsieur Gustave.

12:40.386 --> 12:42.680
You're now going to be
officially interviewed.

12:42.888 --> 12:45.057
Should I go and light
the candle first, sir?

12:45.266 --> 12:46.517
What? No.

12:50.271 --> 12:51.313
Experience?

12:51.522 --> 12:53.649
Hotel Kinski,
Kitchen Boy, six months.

12:53.857 --> 12:56.026
Hotel Berlitz, Mop and
Broom Boy, three months.

12:56.235 --> 12:57.570
Before that I was
a Skillet Scrubber...

12:57.695 --> 12:59.029
Experience, zero.

12:59.113 --> 13:00.114
Thank you again,
Monsieur Gustave.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.198
Straighten that cap, Anatole.

13:01.282 --> 13:03.158
The pleasure's mine, <i>Herr</i> Schneider.
The strap's busted.

13:03.242 --> 13:05.119
These are not acceptable.
I fully agree.

13:05.202 --> 13:06.537
Education?

13:06.662 --> 13:07.913
I studied reading and spelling.

13:08.122 --> 13:10.374
I started my primary school.
I almost...

13:10.583 --> 13:11.584
Education, zero.

13:11.709 --> 13:12.751
Now it's exploded.

13:12.876 --> 13:15.004
Good morning, Cicero.
Call the goddamn plumber!

13:15.087 --> 13:16.367
This afternoon,
Monsieur Gustave?

13:16.380 --> 13:17.506
Without fail, Frau Liebling.

13:17.590 --> 13:19.174
What in hell is this? Not now.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.343
Family?

13:23.762 --> 13:25.598
Zero.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.808
Six, Igor.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.067
Why do you want
to be a Lobby Boy?

13:39.069 --> 13:43.532
Well, who wouldn't,
at the Grand Budapest, sir?

13:43.741 --> 13:45.743
It's an institution.

13:48.621 --> 13:50.205
Very good.

14:05.471 --> 14:06.513
A thousand Klubecks.

14:06.639 --> 14:07.681
My goodness.

14:08.974 --> 14:11.727
Were you ever a Lobby Boy, sir?

14:11.935 --> 14:12.936
What do you think?

14:13.145 --> 14:15.064
Well, I suppose you'd have
to start somewhere...

14:15.272 --> 14:16.940
Go and light the goddamn candle.
Yes, sir.

14:22.154 --> 14:24.156
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA:
And so, my life began.</i>

14:26.992 --> 14:28.285
<i>Junior Lobby Boy in-training,</i>

14:28.494 --> 14:29.912
<i>Grand Budapest Hotel,</i>

14:30.120 --> 14:33.290
<i>under the strict command
of Monsieur Gustave H.</i>

14:33.499 --> 14:36.627
<i>I became his pupil, and he was
to be my counselor and guardian.</i>

14:36.835 --> 14:38.545
<i>GUSTAVE H:
What is</i> a <i>Lobby Boy?</i>

14:38.754 --> 14:42.132
<i>A Lobby Boy's completely
invisible, yet always in sight.</i>

14:42.383 --> 14:44.385
<i>A Lobby Boy remembers
what people hate.</i>

14:44.593 --> 14:46.387
<i>A Lobby Boy anticipates
the client's needs</i>

14:46.595 --> 14:48.680
<i>before the needs are needed.</i>

14:48.889 --> 14:51.975
<i>A Lobby Boy is, above all,
discreet to a fault.</i>

14:52.184 --> 14:54.269
Our guests know
their deepest secrets,

14:54.353 --> 14:55.938
some of which are,
frankly, rather unseemly,

14:56.021 --> 14:57.856
will go with us to our graves.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.316
So keep your mouth shut, Zero.

14:59.441 --> 15:00.692
Yes, sir.

15:02.820 --> 15:04.780
That's all for now.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.907
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA: I began to realize
that many of the hotel's</i>

15:07.116 --> 15:10.828
<i>most valued and distinguished
guests came for him.</i>

15:11.036 --> 15:12.663
<i>It seemed to be an essential
part of his duties...</i>

15:12.746 --> 15:14.081
Ah!

15:14.164 --> 15:16.417
<i>But I believe it
was also his pleasure.</i>

15:18.502 --> 15:20.462
<i>The requirements
were always the same.</i>

15:20.671 --> 15:23.132
<i>They had to be rich,</i>

15:23.340 --> 15:24.425
<i>old,</i>

15:24.633 --> 15:25.801
insecure,

15:26.009 --> 15:27.052
<i>vain,</i>

15:27.261 --> 15:28.512
<i>superficial,</i>

15:28.720 --> 15:29.805
<i>blonde,</i>

15:30.013 --> 15:31.515
needy.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.726
Why blonde?

15:36.854 --> 15:38.147
Because they all were.

15:38.439 --> 15:39.731
<i>He was, by the way,</i>

15:39.940 --> 15:43.527
<i>the most liberally perfumed
man I had ever encountered.</i>

15:43.735 --> 15:46.572
<i>The scent announced his
approach from a great distance</i>

15:48.073 --> 15:50.576
<i>and lingered for many minutes
after he was gone.</i>

15:52.661 --> 15:55.456
<i>I worked six days each week
plus a half-day Sunday,</i>

15:55.664 --> 15:57.916
<i>5:00 AM until
just after midnight.</i>

15:59.084 --> 16:01.670
<i>Our meals were small but
frequent, for stamina.</i>

16:01.879 --> 16:04.673
<i>Two breakfasts, two lunches
and a late supper.</i>

16:05.841 --> 16:09.094
<i>Monsieur Gustave also
delivered</i> a <i>nightly sermon.</i>

16:09.303 --> 16:12.389
Rudeness is merely
the expression of fear.

16:12.598 --> 16:14.808
People fear they
won't get what they want.

16:15.017 --> 16:18.520
The most dreadful and unattractive
person only needs to be loved,

16:18.729 --> 16:21.148
and they will open
up like a flower.

16:21.356 --> 16:22.941
I am reminded of a verse,

16:23.150 --> 16:25.569
"The painter's brush
touched the inchoate face

16:25.777 --> 16:27.738
"by ends of nimble bristles

16:27.946 --> 16:29.823
"and with their
blush of first color,

16:29.948 --> 16:31.825
"rendered her
lifeless cheek living."

16:32.034 --> 16:35.078
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA: His own dinner,
he took alone in his room.</i>

16:40.792 --> 16:44.463
<i>The identity of the owner of the
hotel was unknown to all of us.</i>

16:44.671 --> 16:48.467
<i>Each month, his emissary, known
as Deputy Kovacs, arrived</i>

16:48.675 --> 16:50.511
<i>to review the books
and convey messages</i>

16:50.719 --> 16:53.222
<i>on behalf of
the mysterious proprietor.</i>

16:53.430 --> 16:56.391
<i>On these occasions, Monsieur
Gustave and our business manager,</i>

16:56.600 --> 17:00.103
<i>Herr Becker, met with him in private
consultation above Reception.</i>

17:12.907 --> 17:15.368
<i>This was also when I met Agatha,</i>

17:33.554 --> 17:35.556
<i>but we won't discuss that.</i>

18:26.481 --> 18:27.482
What do you want?
Look.

18:32.571 --> 18:33.739
GUSTAVE H: Dear God.

18:34.031 --> 18:35.198
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

18:35.407 --> 18:36.408
We must go to her.

18:36.491 --> 18:37.492
We must?

18:37.618 --> 18:39.328
Tout de suite.
She needs me, and I need

18:39.453 --> 18:41.163
you to help me with
my bags and so on.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.833
How fast can you pack?
Five minutes.

18:45.042 --> 18:47.042
Do it. And bring a bottle
of the Pouilly-Jouvet '26

18:47.085 --> 18:48.365
in an ice bucket
with two glasses

18:48.378 --> 18:51.340
so we don't have to drink the cat
piss they serve in the dining car.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.517
I blame myself.

19:03.268 --> 19:06.563
She tried to tell me she had a premonition.
I didn't listen.

19:06.772 --> 19:08.357
All of Lutz will
be dressed in black,

19:08.440 --> 19:10.484
except her own ghastly,
deceitful children

19:10.567 --> 19:12.736
whom she loathed and
couldn't bear to kiss hello.

19:12.944 --> 19:15.238
They'll be dancing like gypsies.

19:18.241 --> 19:20.327
There's really no point
in doing anything in life,

19:20.410 --> 19:22.287
because it's all over
in the blink of an eye...

19:22.412 --> 19:25.374
And, the next thing you know,
rigor mortis sets in.

19:25.582 --> 19:28.418
Oh, how the good die young.

19:28.627 --> 19:31.588
With any luck, she's left a few
Klubecks for your old friend,

19:31.755 --> 19:33.340
but one never knows
until the ink

19:33.465 --> 19:35.050
is dry on the death certificate.

19:36.551 --> 19:38.387
She was dynamite in the sack,
by the way.

19:40.430 --> 19:42.766
<i>She was 84, Monsieur Gustave.</i>

19:42.933 --> 19:44.434
I've had older.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.228
When you're young,
it's all fillet steak,

19:46.436 --> 19:49.439
but as the years go by, you have
to move on to the cheaper cuts,

19:49.606 --> 19:51.900
which is fine with me,
because I like those.

19:52.109 --> 19:54.361
More flavorful, or so they say.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.741
Why are we stopping
at a barley field?

20:14.965 --> 20:16.675
Well, hello there, chaps.

20:16.967 --> 20:18.301
Documents, please.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.512
With pleasure.

20:24.599 --> 20:26.479
It's not a very flattering
portrait, I'm afraid.

20:26.685 --> 20:28.311
I was once considered
a great beauty.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.982
What does the "F" stand for?
Fritz? Franz?

20:32.190 --> 20:33.442
Franz.

20:33.567 --> 20:34.776
I knew it!

20:36.153 --> 20:38.029
He's making a funny face.

20:38.280 --> 20:41.825
That's a Migratory Visa with Stage
Three Worker Status, Franz, darling.

20:41.992 --> 20:44.119
He's with me.

20:44.953 --> 20:45.996
Come outside, please.

20:47.497 --> 20:50.459
Now, wait a minute. Sit down, Zero.
His papers are in order.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.127
I cross-referenced
them myself with

20:52.252 --> 20:53.670
the Bureau of
Labor and Servitude.

20:53.879 --> 20:55.714
You can't arrest him simply
because he's a bloody immigrant.

20:55.839 --> 20:58.008
He hasn't done anything wrong.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.557
Stop it, damn you!

21:05.807 --> 21:07.851
Never mind, Monsieur Gustave!
Let them proceed!

21:08.059 --> 21:09.686
GUSTAVE H: Ow! That hurts!

21:12.522 --> 21:15.317
You filthy, goddamn,
pock-marked, fascist assholes!

21:15.525 --> 21:17.819
Take your hands
off my Lobby Boy!

21:29.706 --> 21:31.041
What's the problem?

21:31.208 --> 21:32.292
This is outrageous.

21:32.375 --> 21:35.056
The young man works for me at the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad.

21:37.047 --> 21:38.381
<i>Monsieur Gustave?</i>

21:41.218 --> 21:43.220
My name is Henckels.

21:44.554 --> 21:47.599
I'm the son of Dr. and Mrs. Wolfgang
Henckels-Bergersdörfer.

21:47.849 --> 21:49.559
Do you remember me?

21:50.560 --> 21:54.231
I know exactly who you are. It's uncanny.
You're little Albert.

21:54.397 --> 21:56.233
I'm terribly embarrassed.
Release them.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.236
Release them.

22:04.241 --> 22:05.242
Hmm.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.285
Your colleague is stateless.

22:07.536 --> 22:09.777
He'll need to apply for a
revised Special Transit Permit,

22:09.955 --> 22:13.250
which at this point may be
very difficult to acquire.

22:13.416 --> 22:14.417
Take this.

22:16.086 --> 22:17.462
It's temporary

22:17.546 --> 22:18.964
but it's the best
I can offer, I'm afraid.

22:19.047 --> 22:21.216
And how's your wonderful mother?

22:21.424 --> 22:23.343
She's very well, thank you.
I adore her.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.720
Send my love.
I will.

22:26.638 --> 22:28.473
Your companion
was very kind to me

22:28.598 --> 22:30.475
when I was a lonely little boy.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.979
My men and I apologize
for disturbing you.

22:34.229 --> 22:36.231
I beg your pardon, sir.

22:52.581 --> 22:55.792
You see? There are still faint
glimmers of civilization

22:56.001 --> 22:57.794
left in this barbaric
slaughterhouse

22:57.919 --> 22:59.671
that was once known as humanity.

22:59.921 --> 23:01.298
Indeed, that's what we provide

23:01.381 --> 23:04.175
in our own modest,
humble, insignificant...

23:05.677 --> 23:07.679
Oh, fuck it.

23:39.002 --> 23:41.796
Where is she, Clotilde?
Take me to her.

24:17.374 --> 24:19.376
You're looking so well, darling.
You really are.

24:19.584 --> 24:20.919
They've done a marvelous job.

24:21.169 --> 24:22.409
I don't know what sort of cream

24:22.420 --> 24:23.546
they've put on you
down at the morgue,

24:23.755 --> 24:25.048
but I want some.

24:25.256 --> 24:27.509
Honestly, you look better
than you have in years.

24:27.717 --> 24:29.719
You look like you're alive.

24:35.392 --> 24:39.229
Oh, you changed it after all.
It's perfect.

24:39.437 --> 24:41.231
Clotilde?
Oui, Monsieur Gustave?

24:41.398 --> 24:43.441
A glass of chilled water
with no ice, please.

24:43.858 --> 24:44.943
Yes. M. Gustave...

24:45.026 --> 24:48.346
and. also. M. Serge would like to speak
with you privately in his office. please.

24:49.239 --> 24:50.323
Oh.

24:50.698 --> 24:52.409
All right, then.

24:52.617 --> 24:54.619
I shan't be long, darling.

24:55.870 --> 24:57.914
MR. MOUSTAFA: We were escorted
through a green baize door,

24:58.081 --> 25:01.459
<i>down a narrow service corridor
and into the butler's pantry.</i>

25:04.379 --> 25:06.464
<i>A moment later,
the kitchen passage swung open</i>

25:06.589 --> 25:09.926
<i>and a small servant dressed in
white jolted into the room.</i>

25:10.760 --> 25:13.096
<i>I've never forgotten
the look on that man's face.</i>

25:13.930 --> 25:15.932
What the devil is going on?

25:16.558 --> 25:18.351
<i>I, myself,
had never set foot inside</i>

25:18.476 --> 25:20.270
a <i>house of this kind in my life.</i>

25:21.729 --> 25:24.232
<i>I understood very little about
the events that were to follow.</i>

25:24.441 --> 25:27.402
<i>But, eventually,
I came to recognize,</i>

25:27.610 --> 25:31.114
<i>when the destiny of a great
fortune is at stake,</i>

25:31.322 --> 25:35.076
<i>men's greed spreads like a
poison in the bloodstream.</i>

25:38.413 --> 25:40.582
<i>Uncles, nephews, cousins,</i>

25:40.790 --> 25:43.418
<i>in-laws of increasingly
tenuous connection.</i>

25:43.626 --> 25:45.128
<i>The old woman's
most distant relations</i>

25:45.336 --> 25:47.464
<i>had come foraging
out of the woodwork.</i>

25:49.090 --> 25:51.092
<i>At the head of
this congregation,</i>

25:51.217 --> 25:53.261
<i>it was
a disorienting coincidence,</i>

25:53.470 --> 25:56.181
<i>we discovered our
own Deputy Kovacs,</i>

25:56.431 --> 25:59.142
<i>himself an important attorney,
of course.</i>

25:59.350 --> 26:02.687
<i>He was the executor
of the dead widow's estate.</i>

26:09.527 --> 26:12.530
This is Madame D's
last will and testament.

26:13.823 --> 26:15.825
It consists of a general tontine

26:15.992 --> 26:19.871
drawn up before the event of her
husband's death 46 years ago,

26:20.121 --> 26:23.291
in combination
with 635 amendments,

26:23.500 --> 26:26.169
notations, corrections,
and letters of wishes

26:26.377 --> 26:29.464
executed during
the subsequent decades.

26:31.716 --> 26:33.468
The ultimate legality
of this accumulation

26:33.676 --> 26:34.844
requires further analysis,

26:35.011 --> 26:38.056
but in the opinion of this office,
it was Madame D's intention

26:38.306 --> 26:40.183
that control of the
vast bulk of her estate

26:40.350 --> 26:43.019
should be transferred,
forthwith, to her son, Dmitri,

26:43.228 --> 26:45.855
with special allowances
for his sisters,

26:46.064 --> 26:48.483
Marguerite, Laetizia,
and Carolina,

26:48.691 --> 26:51.694
and minor gifts for various
members of the extended family

26:51.903 --> 26:53.613
as shown in
the List of Recipients,

26:53.738 --> 26:55.406
which I will elucidate
in due course.

26:57.742 --> 26:58.868
However.

27:02.413 --> 27:03.706
An additional codicil,

27:03.873 --> 27:07.210
delivered into my possession
by post only this morning,

27:07.377 --> 27:09.754
and, by all indications,
sent by Madame D

27:10.004 --> 27:11.325
during the last
hours of her life,

27:11.506 --> 27:14.008
contains an amendment
to the original certificate,

27:14.217 --> 27:18.221
which, as prescribed by law,
I will read to you now.

27:18.388 --> 27:19.668
The authenticity
of this document

27:19.722 --> 27:21.883
has not yet been confirmed
by the presiding magistrate,

27:21.891 --> 27:26.062
so I ask that all parties be
patient and refrain from comment

27:26.271 --> 27:29.566
until such time as our
investigations can be completed.

27:38.408 --> 27:41.744
"To my esteemed friend who
comforted me in my later years

27:41.911 --> 27:44.247
"and brought sunshine

28:01.222 --> 28:02.742
I can't believe it.
"...the younger..."

28:02.765 --> 28:03.891
What?

28:04.017 --> 28:05.143
"...which gave us
both so much pleasure."

28:05.268 --> 28:06.269
The van Hoytl?

28:06.352 --> 28:07.478
Tax-free?
Can she do that?

28:07.729 --> 28:09.731
Who's Gustave H?

28:10.940 --> 28:12.609
I'm afraid that's me, darling.

28:14.944 --> 28:17.280
That fucking faggot!

28:17.447 --> 28:19.949
He's a concierge.
What are you doing here?

28:20.116 --> 28:23.119
I've come to pay my respects
to a great woman whom I loved.

28:23.286 --> 28:24.912
This man is an intruder
in my home!

28:25.038 --> 28:26.581
It's not yours yet, Dmitri.

28:26.664 --> 28:29.024
Only when probate is granted,
and the Deed of Entitlement...

28:29.125 --> 28:31.525
You're not getting Boy <i>with
</i> Apple, you goddamn little fruit!

28:33.129 --> 28:35.298
How's that supposed
to make me feel?

28:35.465 --> 28:37.508
Call the police.
We're pressing charges.

28:37.759 --> 28:40.762
This criminal has plagued my
family for nearly 20 years.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.930
He's a ruthless adventurer
and a con-artist

28:43.014 --> 28:45.141
who preys on mentally feeble,
sick old ladies,

28:45.350 --> 28:47.435
and he probably fucks them, too!

28:47.644 --> 28:49.771
I go to bed with all my friends.

28:59.155 --> 29:01.324
Where's Céline?

29:01.491 --> 29:02.909
What?

29:02.992 --> 29:05.036
She's dead.
We're reading her will.

29:05.286 --> 29:07.497
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

29:07.705 --> 29:10.541
If I learn you ever once laid
a finger on my mother's body,

29:10.792 --> 29:12.377
living or dead, I swear to God,

29:12.502 --> 29:14.128
I'll out your throat!
You hear me?

29:14.337 --> 29:16.464
I thought I was supposed
to be a fucking faggot.

29:17.548 --> 29:18.758
You are, but you're bisexual.

29:18.883 --> 29:20.134
Let's change the subject.

29:20.343 --> 29:21.386
I'm leaving.

29:27.600 --> 29:30.269
Wait here quietly. please.

29:30.478 --> 29:33.690
That picture, Boy <i>with</i> Apple,
is priceless. Understand?

29:33.898 --> 29:35.400
Congratulations,
Monsieur Gustave!

29:35.650 --> 29:37.360
They're going to fight me
for the son of a bitch.

29:37.568 --> 29:38.653
Is it very beautiful?

29:38.778 --> 29:39.862
Beyond description.

29:40.071 --> 29:42.532
"E'en the most gifted bard's
rhyme can only sing

29:42.699 --> 29:44.742
"but to the lack of her
and all she isn't!

29:44.992 --> 29:47.370
"His tongue doth..."
Can I see it?

29:47.578 --> 29:49.580
I don't see why not.

30:21.195 --> 30:23.614
This is van Hoytl's
exquisite portrayal

30:23.865 --> 30:26.075
of a beautiful boy
on the cusp of manhood.

30:26.242 --> 30:28.911
Blond, smooth. Skin as
white as that milk.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.455
Of impeccable provenance.

30:30.705 --> 30:34.208
One of the last in private hands,
and unquestionably, the best.

30:34.417 --> 30:35.710
It's a masterpiece.

30:35.918 --> 30:37.962
The rest of this shit
is worthless junk.

31:25.051 --> 31:26.969
<i>M. Gustave?</i>

31:29.305 --> 31:31.140
Can I help you?

31:32.016 --> 31:33.016
Yes. Serge.

31:33.017 --> 31:34.936
You can wrap this up. please.

31:35.186 --> 31:36.280
Wrap up...

31:36.312 --> 31:37.912
Wrap up... "Boy With Apple"?

31:57.041 --> 31:59.502
What did you want
to tell me, before?

32:00.836 --> 32:02.838
I think I cannot say right now.

32:03.047 --> 32:05.341
Write me tomorrow.
Lutzbahn Station!

32:17.311 --> 32:19.313
I'll never part with it.

32:19.522 --> 32:23.901
It reminded her of me. It will
remind me of her. Always.

32:24.151 --> 32:26.821
I'll die with this
picture above my bed.

32:27.029 --> 32:29.031
See the resemblance?

32:30.032 --> 32:32.034
Oh, yes.

32:37.373 --> 32:39.083
Actually, we should sell it.

32:39.333 --> 32:42.336
Sooner rather than later, in
case they try to steal it back.

32:42.545 --> 32:43.906
Plus, something about
those lunatic

32:43.963 --> 32:45.256
foot-soldiers
on the express...

32:45.506 --> 32:48.884
This could be a tricky war and a
long dry spell in the hotel trade.

32:49.051 --> 32:51.596
For all we know, they could
board us up tomorrow.

32:57.935 --> 32:59.895
Let's make
a solemn blood-pact.

33:00.104 --> 33:02.424
We'll contact the black market
and liquidate Boy <i>with</i> Apple

33:02.607 --> 33:03.608
by the end of the week,

33:03.691 --> 33:05.067
then leave the country
and lay low

33:05.234 --> 33:06.611
somewhere along
the Maltese Riviera

33:06.861 --> 33:09.363
until the troubles blow over
and we resume our posts.

33:09.572 --> 33:11.282
In exchange for
your help, your loyalty

33:11.532 --> 33:13.284
and your services
as my personal valet,

33:13.534 --> 33:18.039
I pledge to you 1.5%
of the net sale price.

33:18.247 --> 33:20.249
1.5?
Plus room and board.

33:21.751 --> 33:24.128
Could we make it 10?
10? Are you joking?

33:24.378 --> 33:26.088
That's more than
I'd pay an actual dealer,

33:26.255 --> 33:28.591
and you wouldn't know Chiaroscuro
from chicken giblets.

33:28.799 --> 33:30.479
No, 1.5 is correct.
But I'll tell you what,

33:30.718 --> 33:33.888
if I die first, and I most certainly
will, you will be my sole heir.

33:34.096 --> 33:35.496
There's not much
in the kitty except

33:35.556 --> 33:36.891
a set of ivory-backed
hairbrushes

33:37.099 --> 33:38.434
and my library of
romantic poetry,

33:38.643 --> 33:41.270
but when the time comes,
these will be yours,

33:41.479 --> 33:44.774
along with whatever we haven't
already spent on whores and whiskey.

33:44.940 --> 33:47.568
This is our sacred bond.

33:47.777 --> 33:49.779
I'll draw it up right now.

33:54.784 --> 33:58.829
I, Monsieur Gustave H, being of
relatively sound mind and body,

33:59.080 --> 34:00.915
on this day,
the 19th of October,

34:01.040 --> 34:02.917
in the year of our Lord 1932...

34:03.125 --> 34:05.961
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA: He never told
me where he came from.</i>

34:09.422 --> 34:11.676
<i>I never asked who
his family had been.</i>

34:32.612 --> 34:34.614
Excuse me.

34:35.282 --> 34:36.283
Uh-huh?

34:37.451 --> 34:40.830
The police are here.
They asked for you.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.710
Tell them I'll be right down.

34:47.503 --> 34:49.505
Okay.

34:54.802 --> 34:56.722
Have you ever been questioned
by the authorities?

34:56.971 --> 34:58.332
Yes, on one occasion
I was arrested

34:58.347 --> 34:59.640
and tortured by
the rebel militia

34:59.849 --> 35:00.891
after the Desert Uprising.

35:01.142 --> 35:03.060
You know the drill, then.
Zip it. Of course.

35:03.310 --> 35:06.689
You've never heard the word "van
Hoytl" in your life. Okay, let's go.

35:21.704 --> 35:23.706
How may we serve you, gentlemen?

35:25.040 --> 35:26.167
Ah, Inspector Henckels.

35:26.375 --> 35:28.919
"By order of the Commissioner
of Police, Zubrowka Province,

35:29.170 --> 35:31.011
"I hereby place you under
arrest for the murder

35:31.088 --> 35:33.549
"of Madame Céline Villeneuve
Desgoffe und Taxis."

35:33.716 --> 35:35.217
I knew there was
something fishy.

35:35.342 --> 35:36.844
We never got the cause of death.

35:37.052 --> 35:40.222
She's been murdered
and you think I did it.

35:41.891 --> 35:43.893
HENCKELS: Hey!

35:45.728 --> 35:47.730
Stop!

36:36.904 --> 36:38.948
What happened?

36:39.156 --> 36:41.617
What happened, my dear Zero,
is I beat the living shit

36:41.784 --> 36:44.453
out of a sniveling little runt
called Pinky Bandinski

36:44.662 --> 36:46.455
who had the gall to
question my virility,

36:46.622 --> 36:48.916
because if there's one thing we've
learned from penny dreadfuls,

36:49.124 --> 36:51.285
it's that, when you find
yourself in a place like this,

36:51.335 --> 36:52.795
you must never
be a candy-ass.

36:53.003 --> 36:54.964
You've got to prove
yourself from Day One.

36:55.130 --> 36:56.632
You've got to win their respect.

36:56.966 --> 37:00.094
You should take a long look
at his ugly mug this morning.

37:03.430 --> 37:05.266
He's, actually,
become a dear friend.

37:05.474 --> 37:06.976
You'll meet him, I hope.

37:07.977 --> 37:10.020
So. You've talked to Kovacs?

37:10.271 --> 37:11.647
I saw him last night in secret.

37:11.855 --> 37:14.136
He made me take an oath on a
Bible I wouldn't tell a soul.

37:14.275 --> 37:15.359
You're supposed to also.

37:15.484 --> 37:16.652
I'll do that later.

37:16.819 --> 37:17.987
He suspects you're innocent.

37:18.153 --> 37:19.321
Of course he does.

37:19.488 --> 37:21.282
What's the charge?

37:22.700 --> 37:25.661
In the small hours of
the evening of 19 October,

37:25.869 --> 37:28.914
an individual well-known to the house
and staff, a Monsieur Gustave H,

37:29.123 --> 37:32.251
did arrive at the Desgoffe
und Taxis residence in Lutz

37:32.459 --> 37:34.962
and entered by
the rear service alley,

37:35.170 --> 37:36.505
alerting no one to his presence,

37:36.714 --> 37:40.467
and did then proceed by way of
back stairs and servants' passage,

37:40.676 --> 37:43.012
to deliver himself into the
private chambers of Madame D.

37:43.220 --> 37:45.764
There is no evidence
to indicate whether this visit

37:45.973 --> 37:48.434
had been pre-arranged
with her or not.

37:48.642 --> 37:53.522
The next morning Madame D was found
dead by strychnine poisoning.

37:53.731 --> 37:55.892
Monsieur Gustave was not
observed on the premises again

37:56.066 --> 37:59.236
until, of course,
24 hours later.

37:59.445 --> 38:01.697
The identity of
his accusers is made

38:01.864 --> 38:04.116
clear in this
notarized deposition.

38:04.325 --> 38:07.745
They include, essentially, all
members of the extended family,

38:07.953 --> 38:12.666
but the key witness who actually
ostensibly saw the alleged events

38:12.875 --> 38:15.502
appears to have
fled the jurisdiction.

38:15.711 --> 38:17.379
His whereabouts are
currently unknown,

38:17.588 --> 38:20.215
but he's being sought and pursued
by the relevant authorities.

38:20.424 --> 38:22.509
Who is he?

38:26.639 --> 38:27.640
Serge?

38:27.765 --> 38:28.766
I'm afraid so.

38:28.974 --> 38:31.226
That little prick.

38:31.435 --> 38:33.562
No, I don't believe it.
They put him up to it.

38:33.771 --> 38:35.898
I've been dropped
into a nest of vipers.

38:36.106 --> 38:37.107
You have an alibi?

38:37.316 --> 38:39.485
Of course, but she's married
to the Duke of Westphalia.

38:39.693 --> 38:42.334
I can't allow her name to get
mixed-up in all this monkey business.

38:42.529 --> 38:44.365
Your life may be at stake.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.325
I know, but the bitch legged it.

38:46.533 --> 38:50.287
She's already on board the Queen
<i>Nasstasja</i> halfway to Dutch Tanganyika.

38:52.790 --> 38:54.041
Don't give up.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.600
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA:
The details of the conspiracy,</i>

39:02.758 --> 39:04.885
<i>now a matter of public record,</i>

39:05.094 --> 39:08.222
were, <i>at that time, impossible
for us to apprehend.</i>

39:25.572 --> 39:27.116
I'm looking for Serge X,

39:27.324 --> 39:30.160
a young man in
the service of my employer,

39:30.369 --> 39:33.872
the family Desgoffe und Taxis
of Schloss Lutz.

39:35.499 --> 39:37.084
Yes, sir?
You're his sister?

39:37.876 --> 39:39.670
Yes, sir.
Seen him lately?

39:40.838 --> 39:42.965
No, sir.
No, sir?

39:44.049 --> 39:45.050
No, sir.

39:48.470 --> 39:51.265
I need to find him right away,
for his own safety

39:51.473 --> 39:53.016
and everybody else's.

39:53.225 --> 39:55.894
If he shows up...

39:56.103 --> 39:58.856
Yes, sir?
Tell him Jopling says,

39:59.064 --> 40:01.316
"Come home."

40:03.485 --> 40:06.071
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA:
But one thing was certain,</i>

40:08.115 --> 40:11.702
<i>the Desgoffe und Taxis
were a very powerful family,</i>

40:15.831 --> 40:18.041
<i>and time was not on our side.</i>

40:26.049 --> 40:28.844
A letter from
Monsieur Gustave. Zero.

40:29.762 --> 40:31.764
You want me to?
Read it.

40:37.603 --> 40:39.563
"My dear and
trusted colleagues..."

40:39.772 --> 40:41.815
I miss you deeply
as I write from the confines

40:42.024 --> 40:45.027
of my regrettable and
preposterous incarceration.

40:45.235 --> 40:47.321
Until I walk amongst
you again as a free man,

40:47.529 --> 40:49.907
the Grand Budapest
remains in your hands,

40:50.115 --> 40:52.284
as does its
impeccable reputation.

40:52.493 --> 40:54.495
Keep it spotless and glorify it.

40:54.703 --> 40:57.039
Take extra special care of
every little-bitty bit of it

40:57.247 --> 40:59.333
as if I were watching
over you like a hawk

40:59.541 --> 41:03.003
with a horse whip in its
talons, because I am.

41:03.212 --> 41:06.256
Should I discover a lapse of
any variety during my absence,

41:06.465 --> 41:10.093
I promise, swift and merciless
justice will descend upon you.

41:10.302 --> 41:14.264
A great and noble house has been
placed under your protection.

41:14.473 --> 41:17.100
Tell Zero if you see
any funny business.

41:17.309 --> 41:19.436
"Your devoted
Monsieur Gustave."

41:19.645 --> 41:21.965
Then there's a poem, but we
might want to start on the soup

41:22.105 --> 41:23.482
since it's 46 stanzas.

41:24.691 --> 41:28.445
"A moist, black ash dampens the
filth of a dung-dark rat's nest

41:28.654 --> 41:30.739
"and mingles with
the thick scent of wood rot

41:30.948 --> 41:32.741
"while the lark song
of a guttersnipe..."

41:32.950 --> 41:35.202
JOPLING: I never
trusted that butler.

41:35.410 --> 41:37.204
He's too honest.

41:37.329 --> 41:39.081
DMITRI ON PHONE: Too honest, you <i>say?
</i> JOPLING: Mmm-hmm.

41:39.289 --> 41:41.416
<i>Right, well, be that as it may,</i>

41:41.583 --> 41:43.585
<i>find him quick
and make it snappy.</i>

41:59.893 --> 42:02.479
May I offer any of you
inmates a plate of mush?

42:04.982 --> 42:06.400
No? Anyone?

42:06.608 --> 42:08.861
You with the very
large scar on your face?

42:18.245 --> 42:21.123
Try it. It's actually quite warm
and nourishing this morning.

42:21.331 --> 42:22.374
It needs a dash of salt.

42:31.258 --> 42:32.801
Good day.

42:37.639 --> 42:39.641
Mush, gents?
Any takers?

42:43.770 --> 42:45.314
Suit yourselves.

42:50.861 --> 42:52.529
Rise and shine.
Chop, chop.

42:54.114 --> 42:55.324
Good morning, Pinky.

43:01.121 --> 43:02.414
Mendl's again?

43:02.497 --> 43:03.707
Precisely.

43:03.916 --> 43:05.918
Who's got the throat slitter?

43:11.506 --> 43:12.925
Out of this world.

43:13.050 --> 43:14.426
GUSTAVE H:
Mendl's is the best.

43:14.635 --> 43:16.762
Well, back to work.
Monsieur Gustave?

43:20.349 --> 43:21.767
Yes?

43:25.562 --> 43:27.856
PINKY: Me and the boys
talked it over.

43:28.065 --> 43:30.525
We think you're
a really straight fellow.

43:30.734 --> 43:32.903
Well, I've never been
accused of that before,

43:33.111 --> 43:35.072
but I appreciate the sentiment.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.657
You're one of us now.

43:37.950 --> 43:39.910
What a lovely thing to say.

43:40.118 --> 43:41.995
Thank you, dear Pinky.
Thank you, Gunther.

43:42.204 --> 43:43.622
Thank you, Wolf.

43:43.830 --> 43:45.832
Anything else?

43:47.668 --> 43:48.710
Tell him, Ludwig.

43:50.671 --> 43:53.966
Checkpoint 19 ain't
no two-bit hoosegow.

43:54.174 --> 43:57.427
You got broad-gauge iron bars
on every door, vent and window.

43:57.636 --> 44:01.223
You got 72 guards on the floor
and 16 more in the towers.

44:01.431 --> 44:05.727
You got a 325-foot drop into
a moat full of crocodiles.

44:05.936 --> 44:07.896
But, like the best of them,
it's got a soft spot,

44:08.105 --> 44:09.856
which in this case
happens to take the form

44:10.065 --> 44:12.192
of a storm-drain sewer system

44:12.401 --> 44:14.695
dating from the time of the
original rock fortification

44:14.903 --> 44:16.947
way back in the Middle Ages.

44:17.155 --> 44:20.242
Now, nobody's saying it's a stroll
down a tree-lined promenade

44:20.450 --> 44:22.202
with a fine lady
and a white poodle,

44:22.411 --> 44:26.039
but it's got what
you'd call "vulnerability,"

44:26.248 --> 44:28.917
and that's our bread and butter.

44:29.751 --> 44:31.920
Take a look.

44:33.130 --> 44:34.464
Who drew this?

44:34.673 --> 44:36.758
What do you mean,
"Who drew this?" I did.

44:36.967 --> 44:39.052
Very good. You've got
a wonderful line, Ludwig.

44:39.261 --> 44:40.929
This <i>shows</i> great
artistic promise.

44:41.138 --> 44:44.516
Question, how do you intend to
penetrate this lowest rudiment?

44:44.725 --> 44:47.269
It's 25 inches of reinforced
granite masonry, is it not?

44:47.477 --> 44:49.187
Digging with
the throat-slitter,

44:49.396 --> 44:52.024
I expect this would take three to
six months of continual effort,

44:52.232 --> 44:53.793
during which time
several of our members

44:53.942 --> 44:55.360
will have been
violently executed.

44:55.569 --> 44:57.904
You hit the nail on the head,
Mr. Gustave.

44:58.113 --> 45:00.699
We got fake documents,
second-hand street clothes,

45:00.907 --> 45:03.285
a rope ladder made of
sticks and bunk-linens,

45:03.493 --> 45:05.370
but we need digging tools,

45:05.579 --> 45:08.540
which are proving hard to
come by in this flop-house.

45:22.929 --> 45:24.530
<i>YOUNG</i> WRITER:
<i>At this point in the story,</i>

45:24.681 --> 45:28.268
<i>the old man fell silent and
pushed away his saddle of lamb.</i>

45:28.477 --> 45:31.313
<i>His eyes went
blank as two stones.</i>

45:31.521 --> 45:33.523
<i>I could see he was in distress.</i>

45:33.732 --> 45:34.941
Are you ill,
Mr. Moustafa?

45:35.067 --> 45:36.276
<i>I finally asked.</i>

45:36.485 --> 45:37.569
Oh, dear me, no.

45:37.694 --> 45:38.779
<i>He said.</i>

45:38.987 --> 45:41.406
It's only that I don't
know how to proceed.

45:42.616 --> 45:44.785
<i>He was crying.</i>

45:44.993 --> 45:46.495
You see,
I never speak of Agatha,

45:46.703 --> 45:50.290
because even at
the thought of her name

45:50.499 --> 45:53.251
I'm unable to
control my emotions.

45:56.338 --> 45:58.590
Well, I suppose
there's no way around it.

45:59.883 --> 46:02.219
You see, she saved us.

46:02.511 --> 46:04.346
<i>On our third formal rendezvous,</i>

46:04.554 --> 46:07.474
<i>I had asked for her hand in
marriage and she had agreed.</i>

46:07.557 --> 46:09.559
Will you marry me?
Yes.

46:11.353 --> 46:14.231
<i>We did not have 50 Klubecks
between the two of us.</i>

46:14.439 --> 46:17.692
<i>No one knew, of course, but,
then, who would have cared?</i>

46:17.901 --> 46:20.654
<i>We were each completely
on our own in the world,</i>

46:21.780 --> 46:23.782
<i>and we were deeply in love.</i>

46:32.582 --> 46:34.417
Here.
Thank you.

46:34.626 --> 46:36.461
It's a book.
I see.

46:36.670 --> 46:38.171
<i>Romantic Poetry, Volume One.</i>

46:38.380 --> 46:39.620
Monsieur Gustave recommended it.

46:39.631 --> 46:40.911
I have a copy of my own as well.

46:40.924 --> 46:42.884
I ruined the surprise,
I suppose.

46:43.009 --> 46:44.970
I'll go ahead
and open it, anyway.

46:48.431 --> 46:50.433
Read the inscription.

47:08.952 --> 47:10.036
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA:
Monsieur Gustave insisted</i>

47:10.245 --> 47:12.497
<i>on an immediate and thorough
cross-examination...</i>

47:12.706 --> 47:14.374
She's charming.
She's so charming.

47:15.584 --> 47:18.003
<i>During which he presented
Agatha with a porcelain pendant</i>

47:18.211 --> 47:21.131
<i>and five dozen individually
tissue-wrapped white tulips</i>

47:21.339 --> 47:23.466
<i>in a box the size
of a child's coffin.</i>

47:23.675 --> 47:24.968
It's not right.

47:25.093 --> 47:26.386
I beg your pardon?

47:26.595 --> 47:27.762
Why is he sulking?

47:27.971 --> 47:29.971
She's my girlfriend.
You can't just buy her things.

47:30.056 --> 47:33.393
I'm only interviewing this vision
of loveliness on your behalf.

47:33.602 --> 47:36.188
Never be jealous in this life,
Zero, not even for an instant.

47:36.396 --> 47:37.939
Is he flirting with you?

47:39.232 --> 47:40.734
Yes.

47:40.859 --> 47:42.360
I approve of this union.

47:42.569 --> 47:45.071
Agatha, my beauty,
return to your beloved.

47:45.280 --> 47:46.573
MR. MOUSTAFA:
Soon we learned...

47:46.781 --> 47:48.491
GUSTAVE H:
Blessings upon you both.

47:48.700 --> 47:50.410
<i>Not only was Agatha
immensely skilled</i>

47:50.619 --> 47:53.121
<i>with a palette knife and
a butter-cream flourish...</i>

47:53.330 --> 47:55.332
Mendl.
Go.

47:56.499 --> 47:58.501
<i>She was also very brave.</i>

48:02.964 --> 48:05.050
<i>I believe she was born that way.</i>

48:24.444 --> 48:26.488
Something's missing.

48:26.696 --> 48:31.159
A crucial document, either misplaced
or, conceivably, destroyed.

48:31.368 --> 48:33.870
I don't know what it contains, I
don't know what it represents,

48:34.079 --> 48:35.455
I don't know what it is,

48:35.664 --> 48:38.750
but there are traces
and shadows of it everywhere.

48:38.959 --> 48:40.669
Now, I don't want to alarm you,

48:40.877 --> 48:42.757
and I don't expect to see
any significant change

48:42.796 --> 48:44.236
in the magistrate's
ultimate decision

48:44.339 --> 48:45.799
vis-à-vis your
own inheritance,

48:46.007 --> 48:49.803
but, especially given the
circumstances of the death,

48:50.011 --> 48:52.180
as well as the disappearance
of the key witness

48:52.347 --> 48:54.474
in the murder case, Serge X,

48:54.683 --> 48:56.524
I suggest that we immediately
bring this matter

48:56.559 --> 48:58.770
to the attention of
the municipal inspector

48:58.979 --> 49:00.730
so that there can be
absolutely no question

49:00.939 --> 49:03.316
of impropriety
at any future date.

49:03.525 --> 49:05.277
Agreed?
Not agreed.

49:07.112 --> 49:09.197
Not agreed?
Not agreed.

49:11.908 --> 49:13.493
Can I ask you a question,
Vilmos?

49:13.618 --> 49:15.161
Yes, Dmitri?

49:15.370 --> 49:16.663
Who are you working for?

49:16.788 --> 49:18.039
I beg your pardon?

49:18.248 --> 49:20.041
Who are you working for?

49:20.208 --> 49:22.002
I thought you're supposed
to be our lawyer.

49:22.210 --> 49:23.670
Well, in point of fact,

49:23.753 --> 49:25.588
I'm the executor of the estate.

49:25.797 --> 49:29.926
In this particular situation,
I represent the deceased.

49:30.135 --> 49:31.136
Oh, yeah?

49:31.261 --> 49:34.014
Yeah. A provision for my fees
was included in the...

49:34.222 --> 49:39.019
Just wrap it up and
don't make waves. Agreed?

49:41.021 --> 49:42.981
I'm an attorney.
I'm obligated to

49:43.106 --> 49:45.066
proceed according
to the rule of law.

49:46.443 --> 49:47.569
Not agreed.

49:54.159 --> 49:56.202
This stinks, sisters.

49:59.664 --> 50:01.708
Did he just throw
my cat out the window?

50:03.001 --> 50:04.794
I don't think so.

50:04.878 --> 50:05.879
No. Did he?
Jopling?

50:18.266 --> 50:19.768
Shh-shh.

50:32.864 --> 50:34.866
LUDWIG: Okay.

50:45.418 --> 50:48.171
There's something
I haven't told you, Agatha.

50:48.380 --> 50:49.589
Okay.
We stole a painting.

50:49.798 --> 50:52.342
It's very valuable, maybe five
million Klubecks, in fact.

50:52.550 --> 50:54.427
I don't know if anyone's
even noticed it's missing yet,

50:54.636 --> 50:56.221
but if something
should happen to me...

50:56.429 --> 50:57.931
You steal art?

50:59.015 --> 51:02.060
One picture. Anyway, we need to
make a plan for your survival.

51:02.268 --> 51:05.148
Hide this. It's in code and you might
need a magnifying glass to read it,

51:05.271 --> 51:07.711
but it tells you exactly where
and how to find Boy <i>with</i> Apple.

51:07.732 --> 51:09.776
Don't take less than half the
retail asking price. Also...

51:09.984 --> 51:11.277
Zero, I'm a baker.

51:11.403 --> 51:12.695
You're a pastry chef.

51:12.904 --> 51:14.781
I'm not a fence,
if that's the term.

51:14.989 --> 51:16.866
I don't trade in
stolen property.

51:18.118 --> 51:19.953
I said it wrong.
She willed it to him.

51:29.337 --> 51:31.339
Go to sleep.

51:32.006 --> 51:33.842
<i>Yes, Herr Mendl.</i>

51:36.594 --> 51:38.346
Hide this.
No.

51:38.555 --> 51:40.557
Okay, but take it anyway.

55:06.554 --> 55:09.766
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA: The next morning,
Herr Becker received</i> a <i>peculiar,</i>

55:09.974 --> 55:12.685
<i>last-minute notice from the
office of Deputy Kovacs,</i>

55:12.894 --> 55:17.357
<i>postponing their scheduled
meeting, in perpetuity.</i>

55:47.470 --> 55:49.472
LUDWIG: Let's blow.

56:59.250 --> 57:00.501
How did you get out there?

57:00.626 --> 57:01.878
Shut the fuck up.

57:02.086 --> 57:04.714
These guys are trying to escape.

57:04.922 --> 57:06.632
What's wrong with you,
you goddamn snitch?

57:06.841 --> 57:08.843
Guard! Guard!

57:16.142 --> 57:17.393
It's you.
Thank you.

57:17.477 --> 57:19.604
Thank you, you sweet, kind man.

57:49.467 --> 57:51.469
LUDWIG: Okay.

58:43.521 --> 58:44.855
ALL: Whoa!

59:05.501 --> 59:08.129
I suppose you'd
call that a draw.

59:17.263 --> 59:19.265
Good evening.

59:27.523 --> 59:31.152
Let me introduce you. Pinky, Wolf,
Ludwig, this is the divine Zero.

59:31.360 --> 59:33.195
Gunther was slain
in the catacombs.

59:33.446 --> 59:36.198
Well, boys, who knows when we'll
all meet again, but if one clay...

59:36.449 --> 59:37.491
Hold it.

59:40.494 --> 59:42.872
No time to gab.

59:43.122 --> 59:45.499
Take care of yourself,
Mr. Gustave.

59:45.666 --> 59:47.668
Good luck, kid.

59:51.297 --> 59:52.798
Which way to the safe house?

59:52.923 --> 59:54.383
I couldn't find one.

59:54.508 --> 59:57.553
No safe house? Really? We're
completely on our own out here?

59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.890
I'm afraid so. I asked around, but...

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:04.060
GUSTAVE H: I understand. Too risky.
We'll just have to wing it, I suppose.

01:00:04.143 --> 01:00:06.520
Let's put on our disguises.

01:00:06.687 --> 01:00:07.730
We're wearing them.

01:00:07.855 --> 01:00:08.856
No, we're not.

01:00:09.065 --> 01:00:11.525
We said false whiskers
and fake noses and so on.

01:00:11.692 --> 01:00:12.860
You didn't bring any?

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:14.267
I thought you were growing one.

01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:17.323
And it wouldn't look
realistic, would it?

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:19.700
No, when done properly,
they're perfectly convincing.

01:00:19.909 --> 01:00:21.869
But I take your point.
So be it.

01:00:22.036 --> 01:00:24.497
Give me a few squirts of L'air
de Panache, please, will you?

01:00:26.207 --> 01:00:27.833
Can I not get a squirt, even?

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.543
I forgot the L'air de Panache.

01:00:29.752 --> 01:00:32.338
Honestly, you forgot
the L'air de Panache?

01:00:32.546 --> 01:00:35.508
I don't believe it.
How could you?

01:00:35.716 --> 01:00:38.678
I've been in jail, Zero! Do you
understand how humiliating this is?

01:00:38.886 --> 01:00:40.888
I smell.

01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:44.767
That's just marvelous, isn't it?

01:00:45.017 --> 01:00:47.228
I suppose this is to
be expected back in...

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:48.729
Where do you come from again?

01:00:48.938 --> 01:00:50.439
Aq Salim al-Jabat.
Precisely.

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:53.234
I suppose this is to be expected
back in Aq Salim al-Jabat

01:00:53.401 --> 01:00:54.694
where one's prized possessions

01:00:54.902 --> 01:00:56.862
are a stack of filthy carpets
and a starving goat,

01:00:56.946 --> 01:01:00.741
and one sleeps behind a tent flap and
survives on wild dates and scarabs.

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:03.452
But it's not how I trained you.

01:01:03.703 --> 01:01:05.343
What on God's earth
possessed you to leave

01:01:05.413 --> 01:01:06.747
the homeland where
you obviously belong

01:01:06.914 --> 01:01:08.290
and travel unspeakable distances

01:01:08.416 --> 01:01:11.961
to become a penniless immigrant in a
refined, highly-cultivated society

01:01:12.211 --> 01:01:15.214
that, quite frankly, could've gotten
along very well without you?

01:01:16.132 --> 01:01:17.133
The war.

01:01:18.259 --> 01:01:19.593
Say again?

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.804
Well, you see,
my father was murdered

01:01:22.054 --> 01:01:24.640
and the rest of my family
were executed by firing squad.

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.308
Our village was
burned to the ground

01:01:26.559 --> 01:01:29.770
and those who managed to
survive were forced to flee.

01:01:29.937 --> 01:01:31.772
I left because of the war.

01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:36.444
I see. So you're, actually, really
more of a refugee, in that sense?

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:38.612
Truly.

01:01:38.779 --> 01:01:42.491
Well, I suppose I'd better take
back everything I just said.

01:01:43.743 --> 01:01:46.829
What a bloody idiot I am.
Pathetic fool.

01:01:47.079 --> 01:01:49.165
Goddamn, selfish bastard.

01:01:49.415 --> 01:01:52.460
This is disgraceful, and it's beneath
the standards of the Grand Budapest.

01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:56.172
I apologize on
behalf of the hotel.

01:01:56.422 --> 01:01:58.862
It's not your fault. You were
just upset I forgot the perfume.

01:01:58.966 --> 01:02:02.970
Don't make excuses for me.
I owe you my life.

01:02:03.179 --> 01:02:07.016
You are my dear friend and protégé
and I'm very proud of you.

01:02:07.266 --> 01:02:09.518
You must know that.

01:02:09.769 --> 01:02:11.771
I'm so sorry, Zero.

01:02:13.314 --> 01:02:15.316
We're brothers.

01:02:23.491 --> 01:02:25.493
How's our darling Agatha?

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:31.207
"'Twas first light when I saw
her face upon the heath,

01:02:31.457 --> 01:02:34.043
"and hence did I return,
day-by-day, entranced,

01:02:34.293 --> 01:02:37.171
"tho' vinegar did brine my
heart, never..."

01:02:37.338 --> 01:02:40.059
Very good. I'm going to stop you
there because the alarm has sounded,

01:02:40.216 --> 01:02:43.677
but remember where we left off
because I insist you finish later.

01:03:01.695 --> 01:03:04.448
I want roadblocks
at every junction for 50km.

01:03:04.657 --> 01:03:07.368
I want rail blocks at every
train station for 100km.

01:03:07.618 --> 01:03:09.203
I want 50 men and 10 bloodhounds

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:10.454
ready in five minutes.

01:03:10.663 --> 01:03:12.206
We're going
to strip-search

01:03:12.331 --> 01:03:14.011
every pretzel-Ha us,
Waffel-hut, Biergarten

01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:16.126
and especially every grand hotel

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:17.837
from Äugenzburg to Zilchbrück.

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.047
These men are dangerous,
professional criminals.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.341
At least three of
them are anyway.

01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:23.551
Who are you?

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:26.971
What are you doing here?

01:03:27.054 --> 01:03:28.722
Civilian personnel aren't
permitted in the cellblock.

01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:30.307
This is a military
investigation.

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:31.934
This is Mr. Jopling, sir.

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:34.228
His employer's mother
was one of the victims...

01:03:34.395 --> 01:03:36.730
Shut up.

01:03:37.731 --> 01:03:40.067
You work for the family
Desgoffe und Taxis?

01:03:40.234 --> 01:03:44.196
Are you aware of the murder of Deputy
Vilmos Kovacs on 23rd October?

01:03:44.405 --> 01:03:46.740
I'm aware of his disappearance.

01:03:46.991 --> 01:03:49.551
His body was found stuffed in a
sarcophagus behind a storage room

01:03:49.702 --> 01:03:51.245
at the Kunstmuseum
late last night.

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:54.081
<i>He was short four fingers.</i>

01:03:54.248 --> 01:03:55.541
What do you know about that?

01:03:55.666 --> 01:03:56.917
Nothing.

01:03:58.586 --> 01:04:00.588
Escort Mr. Jopling
off the premises.

01:04:11.098 --> 01:04:13.100
Mendl's.

01:04:17.897 --> 01:04:20.107
Operator, get me the Excelsior
Palace in Baden-Jurgen

01:04:20.274 --> 01:04:21.775
and reverse the charges, please.

01:04:22.026 --> 01:04:23.861
We've no choice. There's
nowhere else to turn.

01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:25.362
I'll hold.
Thank you.

01:04:25.571 --> 01:04:28.282
It's our only hope. Otherwise, I shouldn't
even mention its existence to you.

01:04:28.449 --> 01:04:31.329
It goes without saying, never breathe
a word about this to a living soul.

01:04:31.452 --> 01:04:33.212
Do you swear? Of course.
What is it, in fact?

01:04:33.412 --> 01:04:34.538
I can't say.

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:38.959
How does one come by
front-row aisle seats

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:42.463
for a first night at the Opera
Toscana with one day's notice?

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:44.131
How does one arrange
a private viewing

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:47.134
of the tapestry collection
at the Royal Saxon Gallery?

01:04:47.301 --> 01:04:51.472
How does one secure a corner table
at Chez Dominique on a Thursday?

01:04:51.639 --> 01:04:53.933
Ivan, darling,
it's Gustave. Hello.

01:04:54.141 --> 01:04:56.143
Well, I was until
about five minutes ago.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:59.480
We've taken it upon ourselves to clear
out in a hurry if you see what I mean.

01:04:59.647 --> 01:05:02.149
Well, through a sewer,
as it happens. Exactly.

01:05:02.316 --> 01:05:05.037
Listen, Ivan, I'm sorry to out you
off, but we're in a bit of a bind.

01:05:05.152 --> 01:05:06.820
This is an official request.

01:05:06.987 --> 01:05:10.157
I'm formally calling upon
the special services of...

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:16.830
IVAN: <i>I'll call you back,
Gustave.</i>

01:05:17.081 --> 01:05:18.999
Right. Stand by.

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:22.419
I beg your pardon.
Do you prefer to walk?

01:05:22.628 --> 01:05:24.505
We're right here.
It's very simple.

01:05:24.755 --> 01:05:26.757
Straight down the corniche,
then left.

01:05:26.966 --> 01:05:28.968
Jojo, see the gentleman out.

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:34.139
Get me Monsieur Georges
at the Château Luxe, please.

01:05:35.933 --> 01:05:38.310
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:40.604
Take over.

01:05:40.688 --> 01:05:42.106
<i>Happy birthday, dear...</i>

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:43.524
GEORGES: Hello, Ivan?

01:05:45.693 --> 01:05:47.528
Got it.

01:05:47.778 --> 01:05:50.531
Get me Monsieur Dino at the
Palazzo Principessa, please.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:54.618
Higher, goddammit, higher!

01:05:56.537 --> 01:05:58.205
Take over.

01:05:58.372 --> 01:05:59.957
DINO: Monsieur Georges.
Higher.

01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:02.334
I see. Straightaway.

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:06.380
Get me Monsieur Robin at
I'Hôtel Côte du Cap, please.

01:06:08.132 --> 01:06:10.009
And two and three.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:14.138
Monsieur Robin. There's a call
from Monsieur Dino for you.

01:06:14.346 --> 01:06:16.348
Take over.

01:06:17.725 --> 01:06:19.059
One, two, three.

01:06:19.184 --> 01:06:20.477
<i>ROBIN: Yes, Dino.</i>

01:06:20.686 --> 01:06:23.981
Yes, Dino. Okay, Dino.

01:06:25.733 --> 01:06:28.318
Get me Monsieur Martin
at the Ritz Imperial, please.

01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:31.905
Too much salt.

01:06:32.072 --> 01:06:33.615
Not enough pepper-

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.202
Take over.

01:06:39.246 --> 01:06:41.331
<i>Robin? Martin.
Too much salt.</i>

01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:43.542
So I've heard.

01:06:44.877 --> 01:06:47.838
Maybe.
Let me make a few calls.

01:06:52.926 --> 01:06:55.429
Serge X, missing.
Deputy Kovacs, also missing.

01:06:55.596 --> 01:06:58.432
Madame D, dead. Boy <i>with
</i> Apple, stolen, by us.

01:06:58.599 --> 01:07:01.060
Dmitri and Jopling, ruthless,
cold-blooded savages.

01:07:01.268 --> 01:07:04.521
Gustave H, at large.
What else?

01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:06.023
Zero, confused.

01:07:06.148 --> 01:07:07.441
Zero, confused, indeed.

01:07:07.608 --> 01:07:09.777
The plot "thickens,"
as they say.

01:07:10.027 --> 01:07:12.613
Why, by the way?
Is it a soup metaphor?

01:07:12.863 --> 01:07:14.865
I don't know.

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:21.288
Get in.

01:07:23.749 --> 01:07:25.042
IVAN: We found the butler.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:28.045
He's hiding out in the remote
foothills near Gabelmeister's Peak.

01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:30.380
Our contact convinced him
to meet you midday tomorrow

01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:31.965
at the observatory
on the summit.

01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:34.468
Tell no one.
He'll explain everything.

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:36.762
Your train departs
in four and a half minutes.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:38.388
Here's your tickets.

01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:39.640
Third class?

01:07:39.807 --> 01:07:40.808
It was overbooked

01:07:41.058 --> 01:07:44.645
but the conductor used to be a
sommelier at the old Versailles.

01:07:44.812 --> 01:07:45.979
He pulled some strings.

01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:48.273
You'll need these
for the dining car.

01:07:51.151 --> 01:07:53.153
One last thing.

01:07:54.822 --> 01:07:56.824
L'air de Panache.

01:07:59.326 --> 01:08:01.495
They only had
the half-ounce.

01:08:05.791 --> 01:08:07.793
We should give him something
as a symbolic gesture.

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:10.254
How much money you got? 42
Klubecks and 3 postage stamps.

01:08:10.462 --> 01:08:12.464
Give me 25. Yes.

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:17.553
Bless you.

01:08:17.678 --> 01:08:19.095
Please.

01:08:35.487 --> 01:08:36.572
JOPLING: I've got
to hand it to him.

01:08:36.654 --> 01:08:37.814
DMITRI ON PHONE:
<i>Jesus</i> Christ.

01:08:37.823 --> 01:08:41.577
JOPLING: I didn't see that coming.
Well, what do you want next?

01:08:41.702 --> 01:08:47.040
DMITRI: <i>Talk to the club-footed sister
again, and, this time, be persuasive.</i>

01:08:54.173 --> 01:08:56.966
DMITRI: Goddamn
son of a bitch.

01:09:20.532 --> 01:09:22.533
Holy fuck!

01:09:26.872 --> 01:09:29.750
What's the meaning of this shit?

01:09:29.917 --> 01:09:31.557
Boy <i>with Apple?</i>
I thought you'd hidden it.

01:09:31.627 --> 01:09:34.087
Why are you only noticing now? I
assumed it went to the tax appraiser.

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:36.006
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:38.091
<i>CLOTILDE: Excusez-moi.</i>

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:41.386
I believe it was removed
by Monsieur Gustave.

01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:50.395
I'm not angry with Serge.

01:09:50.604 --> 01:09:53.064
You can't blame someone for their
basic lack of moral fiber.

01:09:53.273 --> 01:09:55.234
He's a frightened, little,
yellow-bellied coward.

01:09:55.442 --> 01:09:57.482
It's not his fault, is it?
I don't know. It depends.

01:09:57.694 --> 01:09:59.238
Well, you can say that
about most anything.

01:09:59.321 --> 01:10:00.739
"It depends."
Of course it depends.

01:10:00.948 --> 01:10:02.628
Of course it depends.
Of course it depends.

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.785
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Of course it depends.

01:10:05.035 --> 01:10:08.455
That doesn't mean I'm not going
to throttle the little swamp rat.

01:10:10.958 --> 01:10:15.254
May I officiate, by the way?
The ceremony?

01:10:15.462 --> 01:10:16.463
With pleasure.

01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:19.258
I must say, I find that
girl utterly delightful.

01:10:19.466 --> 01:10:20.968
Flat as a board,
enormous birthmark

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:22.970
the shape of Mexico
over half her face,

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.305
sweating for hours on end
in that sweltering kitchen

01:10:25.472 --> 01:10:26.890
while Mendl,
genius though he is,

01:10:27.099 --> 01:10:28.642
looms over her like
a hulking gorilla.

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:31.061
Yet without question,
without fail,

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:34.481
always and invariably,
she's exceedingly lovely.

01:10:34.648 --> 01:10:35.983
Why?

01:10:36.233 --> 01:10:38.819
Because of her purity.

01:10:40.904 --> 01:10:43.156
She admires you as well,
Monsieur Gustave.

01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:44.658
Does she?

01:10:44.783 --> 01:10:46.076
Very much.

01:10:46.285 --> 01:10:50.080
That's a good sign, you know.
It means she "gets it."

01:10:50.289 --> 01:10:52.291
That's important.

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:56.753
Don't flirt with her.

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:46.053
LIEUTENANT: A radio telegram was delivered
and signed for by the girl at 4:00 AM.

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:48.900
The envelope was found near the body,
but its contents were missing.

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:50.974
However, the telegraph
office always keeps

01:11:51.058 --> 01:11:52.809
a carbon of the ticker tape
for 24 hours.

01:11:53.018 --> 01:11:55.228
I copied it down.
It reads as follows,

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:57.397
"Pack your things stop.

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:59.733
"Be ready to leave
at moment's notice stop.

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:02.361
"Hide-out is vicinity
of Gabelmeister's Peak stop.

01:12:02.569 --> 01:12:04.988
"Destroy this message
all my love full stop."

01:12:06.073 --> 01:12:07.866
Where's the basket?

01:12:33.183 --> 01:12:35.185
PUMP ATTENDANT:
Where you headed, mister?

01:12:38.897 --> 01:12:41.233
Skiing? Sledding?
Mountain climbing?

01:12:50.951 --> 01:12:52.911
Three Klubecks.

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:04.966
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA: By express
wireless, I wrote Agatha</i>

01:13:05.048 --> 01:13:07.801
<i>with instructions to move
to our pre-arranged hideout,</i>

01:13:07.968 --> 01:13:10.470
<i>a Gypsy caravan
on the outer Nebelsbad road,</i>

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.472
<i>while Monsieur Gustave
and I continued east</i>

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:14.099
<i>into the Zubrowkian Alps,</i>

01:13:14.307 --> 01:13:18.061
<i>toward our high-altitude rendezvous
with the butler Serge X.</i>

01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:22.274
<i>As a precaution,
we disembarked quietly</i>

01:13:22.482 --> 01:13:24.901
<i>in the freight yard
just outside the station.</i>

01:13:32.492 --> 01:13:34.327
L'air de Panache.

01:13:44.963 --> 01:13:47.443
It's a hell of a view. I give
them that, for what's it's worth.

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:49.467
I agree.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:03.982
"'Tis oft'-remarked, no single,
falling-flake does any other

01:14:04.232 --> 01:14:07.819
"in its pure and perfect
form..." Somebody's coming.

01:14:10.363 --> 01:14:13.533
Are you Monsieur Gustave of the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:14.993
Uh-huh.

01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:16.369
Get on the next cable car.

01:14:55.909 --> 01:14:59.329
Are you Monsieur Gustave of the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:00.538
Uh-huh.

01:15:00.664 --> 01:15:01.665
Switch with me.

01:15:31.236 --> 01:15:33.947
Are you Monsieur Gustave of the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:35.532
Uh-huh.

01:15:35.657 --> 01:15:36.950
Put these on and sing.

01:16:02.475 --> 01:16:03.935
MONK: Psst.

01:16:05.103 --> 01:16:06.271
Are you Monsieur
Gustave of the...

01:16:06.396 --> 01:16:07.564
Yes, dammit.

01:16:07.772 --> 01:16:08.773
Confess.

01:16:08.982 --> 01:16:10.775
I'm innocent.

01:16:10.984 --> 01:16:12.819
Hmm? No, no.

01:16:22.328 --> 01:16:24.998
Forgive me, Monsieur Gustave.
I never meant to betray you.

01:16:25.165 --> 01:16:26.583
They threatened my life and now

01:16:26.708 --> 01:16:28.126
they've murdered my only family.

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:29.919
No. Who did they
kill this time?

01:16:30.128 --> 01:16:31.254
My dear sister.

01:16:31.379 --> 01:16:32.505
The girl with the club foot?

01:16:32.672 --> 01:16:34.090
Yes.
Those fuckers!

01:16:34.299 --> 01:16:35.739
I tried to warn you
at the beginning.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.343
I know, darling.
Let's put that behind us.

01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:39.012
Listen, I hate to
put you on the spot,

01:16:39.137 --> 01:16:40.597
but I really must ask
you to clear my name.

01:16:40.805 --> 01:16:43.850
Obviously you're grieving...
There's more.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.435
To the story.
I get it. Go on.

01:16:45.643 --> 01:16:47.645
I was the official witness
in Madame D's presence

01:16:47.854 --> 01:16:49.439
to the creation of a second will

01:16:49.647 --> 01:16:52.692
to be executed only in the
event of her death by murder.

01:16:52.859 --> 01:16:54.360
A second will?
Right.

01:16:54.611 --> 01:16:56.154
In case she got bumped off?
Right.

01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:57.781
Uh-huh?
But they destroyed it.

01:16:57.989 --> 01:16:59.449
Oh, dear.
However...

01:16:59.657 --> 01:17:01.159
Uh-huh?
I pulled a copy.

01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:03.495
A second copy of
the second will?

01:17:03.703 --> 01:17:04.996
Right.
Uh-huh?

01:17:07.707 --> 01:17:10.043
What does it say? Where is it?
What's it all about, dammit?

01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:11.250
Don't keep us in suspense.

01:17:11.294 --> 01:17:13.004
This has been a complete
fucking nightmare.

01:17:13.213 --> 01:17:15.632
Just tell us what
the fuck is going on!

01:17:17.467 --> 01:17:18.885
Serge?

01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:20.678
Serge? Serge!

01:17:24.724 --> 01:17:27.060
Bloody hell. They've
strangled the poor slob.

01:17:55.046 --> 01:17:56.047
Come on! Let's go!

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:05.056
ZERO: What do we do
if we catch him?

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:06.224
GUSTAVE H: I don't know.

01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:08.726
He's a homicidal psychopath.
Let's stop.

01:18:08.935 --> 01:18:11.187
I can't. I can barely steer.

01:19:19.005 --> 01:19:22.634
You sick, pathetic creep.
I hate you.

01:19:35.355 --> 01:19:37.774
"'If this do be me end,
farewell!'

01:19:37.857 --> 01:19:39.192
"cried the wounded piper-boy,

01:19:40.777 --> 01:19:41.903
"whilst the muskets cracked

01:19:41.986 --> 01:19:43.363
"and the yeomen
roared 'Hurrah!'

01:19:43.529 --> 01:19:44.697
"And the ramparts fell.

01:19:46.366 --> 01:19:49.953
"'Methinks me breathes me
last, me fears!' said he..."

01:19:50.161 --> 01:19:52.038
Holy shit! You got him!

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:54.207
Well done, Zero!

01:20:05.385 --> 01:20:07.720
<i>Gustave H! You are
a fugitive from justice!</i>

01:20:07.971 --> 01:20:10.556
<i>Surrender lawfully and
I will personally vouchsafe</i>

01:20:10.848 --> 01:20:11.849
<i>your fair treatment.</i>

01:20:11.975 --> 01:20:13.518
<i>Do not attempt to flee!</i>

01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:15.228
ZERO: What do you think?
I don't know.

01:20:15.395 --> 01:20:16.813
I'd rather jump off
this cliff right now

01:20:16.938 --> 01:20:18.314
than go back to fucking prison.

01:20:18.523 --> 01:20:20.963
I say we steal that sick maniac's
motorcycle, go fetch Agatha,

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:22.193
<i>take back Boy with Apple</i>

01:20:22.277 --> 01:20:23.903
and head for the Maltese
Riviera, once and for all.

01:20:24.153 --> 01:20:26.906
Very good! You're so extraordinary, Zero.
Thank you.

01:20:27.073 --> 01:20:29.575
A moment of silence in
memoriam of a devoted servant

01:20:29.826 --> 01:20:32.537
killed violently during
the conduct of his duties.

01:20:35.498 --> 01:20:37.500
Goodbye, Serge.

01:20:39.002 --> 01:20:41.004
Okay, let's go.

01:20:53.808 --> 01:20:55.601
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA:
The war began at midnight.</i>

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:58.271
<i>Pffeifelstad fell by lunch
under heavy shelling,</i>

01:20:58.479 --> 01:21:01.816
<i>and 10 battalions surged across
the long western border.</i>

01:21:02.025 --> 01:21:03.818
<i>High-command
advanced to Nebelsbad.</i>

01:21:16.039 --> 01:21:19.667
Compliments of <i>Herr</i> Mendl,
for the executive staff.

01:21:22.795 --> 01:21:26.155
CHUCK: General Stieglitz requests a garden-view
sitting room with an extra roll-away.

01:21:26.174 --> 01:21:28.134
Let's put him in
the Duke Leopold Suite.

01:21:28.343 --> 01:21:30.011
Secretary Woroniecki's
office cabled.

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:33.806
He's checking in a day early.
Rooms 401 -2-3.

01:21:33.973 --> 01:21:35.641
Tell Tactical Logistics
we're moving them

01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:37.369
to a standard double
on the third floor.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.395
They'll need more
space than that.

01:22:02.502 --> 01:22:07.173
GUSTAVE H: The beginning of the end of
the end of the beginning has begun.

01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:10.385
A sad finale played off-key
on a broken-down saloon piano

01:22:10.593 --> 01:22:13.179
in the outskirts of
a forgotten ghost town.

01:22:13.346 --> 01:22:15.348
I'd rather not bear witness
to such blasphemy.

01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:16.557
Me neither.

01:22:16.766 --> 01:22:19.060
The Grand Budapest
has become a troops' barracks.

01:22:19.268 --> 01:22:21.729
I shall never cross its
threshold again in my lifetime.

01:22:21.938 --> 01:22:23.439
Me neither.
Never again shall I...

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:26.692
Actually, I think we might be going
in there right now after all.

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:29.946
Dmitri.

01:22:32.907 --> 01:22:34.617
Agatha.

01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:47.535
Good evening, Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis.
I'm Monsieur Chuck.

01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:50.883
We've booked you and your sisters
into the King Ferdinand Suite.

01:22:51.092 --> 01:22:53.052
Good evening. General von
Shrecker asked me...

01:22:53.261 --> 01:22:54.554
Who's that?

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.055
I beg your pardon?

01:22:56.222 --> 01:22:58.975
I think that girl's
got my picture. Excuse me.

01:23:15.575 --> 01:23:17.577
AGATHA: Six.
DMITRI: Hold it.

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:21.789
DMITRI: Six.

01:23:24.959 --> 01:23:26.752
Compliments of <i>Herr</i> Mendl.

01:23:42.935 --> 01:23:43.936
GUSTAVE H: Excuse me.

01:23:44.103 --> 01:23:46.304
Have you seen a pastry girl
with a package under her arm

01:23:46.439 --> 01:23:47.639
in the last minute and a half?

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:50.213
Yep. She just got on the elevator
with Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis.

01:23:50.276 --> 01:23:52.487
Thank you.

01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:54.113
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.907
Otto, sir, the new Lobby Boy.

01:23:56.032 --> 01:23:57.617
You haven't been
trained properly.

01:23:57.825 --> 01:23:59.952
A Lobby Boy never provides
information of that kind.

01:24:00.119 --> 01:24:02.121
You're a stone wall.
Understood?

01:24:18.971 --> 01:24:20.556
Pretty picture.

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:22.391
Sixth floor.

01:25:06.185 --> 01:25:07.895
<i>Where's Boy with Apple?</i>

01:25:08.854 --> 01:25:11.107
None of your goddamn business!

01:25:11.899 --> 01:25:15.570
I'm going to blast your candy-ass
once and for all right now.

01:25:25.037 --> 01:25:26.581
Drop your weapon!

01:25:48.811 --> 01:25:50.730
Cease fire! Cease fire! Whoa!

01:25:50.938 --> 01:25:52.273
Stop it!

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:54.066
Who's shooting who?

01:25:54.233 --> 01:25:56.736
That's Gustave H! The escaped
murderer and art thief.

01:25:56.944 --> 01:25:58.112
I've got him cornered!

01:25:58.321 --> 01:25:59.739
That's Dmitri
Desgoffe und Taxis!

01:25:59.947 --> 01:26:01.949
He's responsible for the
killing of Deputy Kovacs,

01:26:02.158 --> 01:26:04.994
Serge X and his club-footed
sister, plus his own mother!

01:26:06.579 --> 01:26:08.748
Nobody move.
Everybody's under arrest.

01:26:10.124 --> 01:26:12.418
Who's out the window?

01:26:12.585 --> 01:26:14.587
Agatha!

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:21.802
310-bis.

01:26:22.011 --> 01:26:23.220
Hang on! Here I come!

01:26:48.371 --> 01:26:49.972
AGATHA: Something's
on the back of the...

01:26:56.128 --> 01:26:57.129
Agatha!

01:26:57.296 --> 01:26:59.006
Agatha!

01:26:59.215 --> 01:27:01.217
Are you all right?
I think so.

01:27:02.885 --> 01:27:04.845
Something's on
the back of the picture.

01:27:18.234 --> 01:27:19.235
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA:
She left everything</i>

01:27:19.318 --> 01:27:21.028
<i>to Monsieur Gustave, of course.</i>

01:27:22.988 --> 01:27:25.324
<i>The mansion,
known as Schloss Lutz,</i>

01:27:26.826 --> 01:27:29.912
<i>the factories, which produced
weapons, medicine and textiles,</i>

01:27:32.873 --> 01:27:34.542
<i>an important
newspaper syndicate,</i>

01:27:35.668 --> 01:27:38.045
<i>and perhaps
you've already deduced</i>

01:27:38.379 --> 01:27:44.051
<i>this very institution,
the Grand Budapest Hotel.</i>

01:27:44.385 --> 01:27:45.886
<i>He anointed me his successor,</i>

01:27:46.095 --> 01:27:49.014
<i>and as the war continued,
I served my adopted country</i>

01:27:49.181 --> 01:27:52.393
<i>from the narrow desk still found
against the wall in the next room.</i>

01:27:53.853 --> 01:27:55.938
<i>He was the same
as his disciples,</i>

01:27:56.188 --> 01:27:59.525
<i>insecure, vain,
superficial, blond, needy.</i>

01:28:00.359 --> 01:28:02.570
<i>In the end he was even rich.</i>

01:28:03.946 --> 01:28:07.116
<i>He did not succeed, however,
in growing old.</i>

01:28:11.871 --> 01:28:13.747
"Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together..."

01:28:13.956 --> 01:28:15.791
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA:
Nor did my darling Agatha.</i>

01:28:16.041 --> 01:28:18.294
<i>She and our infant son would
be killed two years later</i>

01:28:18.544 --> 01:28:21.380
<i>by the Prussian grippe.
An absurd little disease.</i>

01:28:21.589 --> 01:28:24.133
<i>Today we treat it
in</i> a <i>single</i> week,

01:28:24.258 --> 01:28:26.802
<i>but, in those days
many millions died.</i>

01:28:30.097 --> 01:28:31.932
<i>On the 21st day
of the occupation,</i>

01:28:32.141 --> 01:28:34.894
<i>the morning the independent
state of Zubrowka</i>

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.228
<i>officially ceased to exist,</i>

01:28:36.395 --> 01:28:38.397
<i>we traveled with
Monsieur Gustave to Lutz.</i>

01:28:38.564 --> 01:28:40.816
In answer to your earlier
question, by the way,

01:28:41.066 --> 01:28:42.902
of course.

01:28:44.737 --> 01:28:47.573
Zero asked me about my humble
beginnings in the hotel trade.

01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:50.075
I was, perhaps, for a time,
considered the best Lobby Boy

01:28:50.284 --> 01:28:52.661
we'd ever had at
the Grand Budapest.

01:28:52.912 --> 01:28:54.330
I think I can say that.

01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:56.415
This one finally surpassed me.

01:28:56.624 --> 01:28:59.585
Although, I must say,
he had an exceptional teacher.

01:28:59.752 --> 01:29:00.920
Truly.

01:29:06.175 --> 01:29:09.136
"Whence came these two
radiant, celestial brothers,

01:29:09.345 --> 01:29:10.638
"united, for an instant,

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:15.100
"as they crossed the stratosphere
of our starry window?

01:29:15.309 --> 01:29:18.103
"One from the East
and one from the West."

01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:20.022
Very good.

01:29:20.272 --> 01:29:22.274
Don't flirt with her.

01:29:24.610 --> 01:29:26.862
Why are we stopping
at a barley field again?

01:29:35.204 --> 01:29:38.332
I find these black
uniforms very drab.

01:29:42.836 --> 01:29:44.129
Well, hello there, chaps.

01:29:44.213 --> 01:29:45.798
We were just talking about you.

01:29:46.048 --> 01:29:47.841
Documents, please.

01:29:47.967 --> 01:29:49.802
With pleasure, as always.

01:29:54.223 --> 01:29:56.016
You're the first of
the official death squads

01:29:56.225 --> 01:29:58.477
to whom we've been
formally introduced.

01:29:58.644 --> 01:30:00.646
How do you do?

01:30:01.855 --> 01:30:03.899
<i>Plus</i> ça change, am I right?

01:30:08.362 --> 01:30:11.740
Uh, that's a migratory visa with
stage three worker status, darling.

01:30:11.991 --> 01:30:12.992
Read this.

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:23.669
SOLDIER: Come outside.

01:30:23.836 --> 01:30:25.170
GUSTAVE H: Now, stay there.

01:30:27.381 --> 01:30:29.675
I give you my word, if you
lay a finger on this man,

01:30:29.883 --> 01:30:32.052
I'll see you
dishonorably discharged,

01:30:32.261 --> 01:30:35.347
locked up in the stockade
and hanged by sundown.

01:30:36.682 --> 01:30:38.517
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA: There are still
faint glimmers of civilization</i>

01:30:38.684 --> 01:30:40.853
<i>left in this
barbaric slaughterhouse</i>

01:30:40.978 --> 01:30:43.063
<i>that was once known as humanity.</i>

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:49.737
You filthy, goddamn,
pock-marked, fascist assholes!

01:30:50.863 --> 01:30:53.532
MR. MOUSTAFA:
He was one of them.

01:30:53.741 --> 01:30:55.659
<i>What more is there to say?</i>

01:31:03.417 --> 01:31:06.045
What happened in the end?

01:31:06.253 --> 01:31:08.255
In the end they shot him.

01:31:10.049 --> 01:31:12.051
So it all went to me.

01:31:20.893 --> 01:31:24.146
<i>YOUNG</i> WRITER: <i>After dinner, we went
to collect the keys to our rooms,</i>

01:31:24.396 --> 01:31:26.231
<i>but Monsieur Jean
had abandoned his post.</i>

01:31:26.398 --> 01:31:28.567
I expect he's forgotten
all about us.

01:31:28.776 --> 01:31:29.902
YOUNG WRITER:
In recent years, of course,

01:31:30.069 --> 01:31:32.321
<i>such properties and holdings
as the Grand Budapest</i>

01:31:32.571 --> 01:31:36.158
<i>had with very few exceptions
become common property.</i>

01:31:37.117 --> 01:31:39.161
<i>While the precise terms
of his negotiation</i>

01:31:39.411 --> 01:31:41.331
<i>with the new government
had never been announced,</i>

01:31:41.497 --> 01:31:42.697
<i>the result was an open secret,</i>

01:31:43.582 --> 01:31:46.293
<i>Zero Moustafa had traded
a great and important fortune</i>

01:31:46.502 --> 01:31:50.798
<i>in exchange for one costly,
unprofitable, doomed hotel.</i>

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:52.841
<i>Why?</i>

01:31:53.092 --> 01:31:55.135
<i>Was it merely sentimental?</i>

01:31:55.344 --> 01:31:59.098
<i>It was quite forward of me
and a bit out of character,</i>

01:31:59.264 --> 01:32:01.100
<i>but I felt I must know,</i>

01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:03.352
<i>for my health, I suppose.</i>

01:32:05.938 --> 01:32:08.148
Forgive me for asking.
I hope I haven't upset you.

01:32:08.357 --> 01:32:10.359
No, of course not.

01:32:11.443 --> 01:32:14.279
Is it simply your last connection
to that vanished world,

01:32:14.446 --> 01:32:16.782
his world, if you will?

01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:18.700
His world?

01:32:18.951 --> 01:32:21.954
No, I don't think so.

01:32:22.121 --> 01:32:24.206
You see, we shared a vocation.

01:32:24.456 --> 01:32:26.166
It wouldn't have been necessary.

01:32:26.375 --> 01:32:31.046
No. The hotel
I keep for Agatha.

01:32:32.506 --> 01:32:33.799
We were happy here.

01:32:34.007 --> 01:32:36.009
For a little while.

01:32:41.348 --> 01:32:43.642
To be frank, I think
his world had vanished

01:32:43.851 --> 01:32:45.727
long before he ever entered it.

01:32:45.978 --> 01:32:47.521
But, I will say,

01:32:47.729 --> 01:32:51.233
he certainly sustained the
illusion with a marvelous grace.

01:32:52.818 --> 01:32:55.028
Are you going up? No, I'll
sit for a little while.

01:32:55.237 --> 01:32:57.030
Good night.

01:33:02.411 --> 01:33:03.495
<i>YOUNG</i> WRITER:
<i>The next</i> week,

01:33:03.704 --> 01:33:05.914

01:33:06.165 --> 01:33:08.750
<i>and began a long,
wandering journey abroad.</i>

01:33:09.001 --> 01:33:11.837
<i>I did not return to
Europe for many years.</i>

01:33:16.884 --> 01:33:19.344

managed to see it again.</i>
