00:08.800 --> 00:12.840
<b>The revived King, now calling himself Meruem,</b>

00:12.840 --> 00:14.730
<b>carried Pouf and Youpi back to the palace</b>

00:14.730 --> 00:18.620
<b>in order to recover his memories.</b>

00:26.950 --> 00:29.660
<b>Pouf's main body is with the King!</b>

00:31.530 --> 00:34.380
<b>They're heading toward the palace 
at an alarming speed.</b>

00:38.380 --> 00:41.270
<b><i>That probably means the chairman lost.</i></b>

00:42.870 --> 00:46.400
<b><i>What can the rest of us can do?</i></b>

02:07.980 --> 02:12.980
<b>Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective</b>

02:21.870 --> 02:23.900
<b><i>What's happening?</i></b>

02:25.400 --> 02:27.530
<b><i>Where is the Supreme Leader?</i></b>

02:33.950 --> 02:35.530
<b>It won't stop following us.</b>

02:36.190 --> 02:37.340
<b>That's annoying.</b>

02:38.200 --> 02:40.260
<b>It's the enemy's power.</b>

02:40.790 --> 02:43.390
<b>I believe it won't disappear until we've damaged</b>

02:43.390 --> 02:45.120
<b>the enemy's physical body.</b>

02:46.140 --> 02:48.490
<b>Ah, how interesting.</b>

02:49.550 --> 02:50.580
<b>I shall test it.</b>

02:54.360 --> 02:57.650
<b><i>Incredible, that's my...</i></b>

03:27.170 --> 03:28.280
<b>I understand.</b>

03:29.320 --> 03:33.240
<b><i>My power was not meant for me.</i></b>

03:33.780 --> 03:36.980
<b><i>It was meant to be used by the King!</i></b>

03:37.760 --> 03:38.710
<b>Youpi.</b>

03:41.120 --> 03:42.820
<b>This does not make sense.</b>

03:46.430 --> 03:50.580
<b>If you knew this power resulted 
from an enemy's attack,</b>

03:51.390 --> 03:54.290
<b>that means either you saw it used,</b>

03:54.290 --> 03:58.010
<b>or it was used on you.</b>

04:00.150 --> 04:01.270
<b>Which was it?</b>

04:08.520 --> 04:11.140
<b>I was hit by an attack.</b>

04:14.430 --> 04:18.490
<b>I cannot see it following you now.</b>

04:19.900 --> 04:22.120
<b>So why does the enemy still live?</b>

04:25.540 --> 04:29.190
<b>How did you free yourself 
from the enemy's power?</b>

04:30.620 --> 04:31.600
<b>Answer me.</b>

04:36.850 --> 04:38.780
<b>We made an agreement.</b>

04:40.550 --> 04:43.050
<b>In exchange for releasing me from his power,</b>

04:43.660 --> 04:45.050
<b>I agreed to spare his comrade.</b>

04:47.690 --> 04:49.670
<b>Then, after he released you,</b>

04:50.200 --> 04:53.530
<b>you had the opportunity to finish 
him off along with his comrade.</b>

04:54.000 --> 04:55.560
<b>Why did you not do so?</b>

04:56.350 --> 04:59.550
<b>Honestly, I'm not sure.</b>

05:03.250 --> 05:08.450
<b>I believe I felt that, if I had, 
I would have lost in some way.</b>

05:09.640 --> 05:11.740
<b>I felt that breaking a promise,</b>

05:11.740 --> 05:14.480
<b>even a promise to an enemy,</b>

05:14.480 --> 05:16.710
<b>would be equivalent to conceding defeat.</b>

05:16.950 --> 05:18.180
<b>Impossible!</b>

05:18.180 --> 05:20.960
<b>You're saying that your personal emotions</b>

05:21.280 --> 05:25.400
<b>were the reason you spared the lives 
of those who oppose the King?</b>

05:26.800 --> 05:30.470
<b>I'm prepared to accept any punishment...</b>

05:31.940 --> 05:34.290
<b>I have no excuses to offer.</b>

05:39.930 --> 05:42.610
<b>I only ordered that you not lie to me.</b>

05:43.050 --> 05:49.110
<b>I have no reason to punish 
those who speak the truth.</b>

05:52.500 --> 05:53.360
<b>Pouf.</b>

05:53.920 --> 05:54.870
<b>Yes!</b>

05:55.270 --> 05:56.120
<b>Youpi.</b>

05:56.430 --> 05:57.250
<b>Yes!</b>

05:58.110 --> 06:00.840
<b>We have all obtained rather inconvenient bodies.</b>

06:04.620 --> 06:08.280
<b>Our bodies and souls have been linked...</b>

06:09.170 --> 06:13.140
<b>It is no longer possible for the three of 
us to hide anything from one another!</b>

06:16.650 --> 06:18.020
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

06:19.000 --> 06:20.270
<b>Your Majesty...</b>

06:21.580 --> 06:22.370
<b>Let us go.</b>

06:22.690 --> 06:23.550
<b>Yes!</b>

06:28.460 --> 06:29.370
<b><i>Your Majesty...</i></b>

06:29.980 --> 06:33.550
<b><i>Was that meant as a final warning</i></b>

06:34.160 --> 06:39.660
<b><i>because you realize what I plan to do, 
and the guilt it makes me feel?</i></b>

06:41.670 --> 06:42.880
<b><i>Nevertheless!</i></b>

06:43.840 --> 06:46.790
<b><i>Even if it means I am executed for my crime...</i></b>

06:49.280 --> 06:50.510
<b><i>I do this for the King!</i></b>

06:53.980 --> 06:55.890
<b>Where is she? Find her!</b>

06:55.890 --> 06:56.980
<b>Hurry up and find her!</b>

06:56.980 --> 06:58.680
<b><i>For the sake of our species!</i></b>

06:58.680 --> 07:00.100
<b>Where is she?</b>

07:00.100 --> 07:01.900
<b>Find her!</b>

07:03.660 --> 07:05.400
<b><i>She is not necessary!</i></b>

07:05.400 --> 07:06.440
<b>Find her, quickly!</b>

07:06.440 --> 07:08.170
<b><i>I do this for the King.</i></b>

07:08.170 --> 07:08.940
<b>Is she over there?</b>

07:08.940 --> 07:10.390
<b>Wait! Not there!</b>

07:10.390 --> 07:11.910
<b>No! That way!</b>

07:12.610 --> 07:13.410
<b>Hey!</b>

07:15.190 --> 07:19.920
<b>When you're split up, you can't hurt me.</b>

07:24.400 --> 07:25.840
<b>You're ignoring me?</b>

07:25.840 --> 07:27.200
<b>Wait up!</b>

07:27.200 --> 07:30.120
<b>You can't remove APR without defeating me!</b>

07:30.590 --> 07:33.930
<b>Youpi, the enemy suddenly appeared before me.</b>

07:34.920 --> 07:36.400
<b>Does the enemy who attached this</b>

07:36.400 --> 07:38.180
<b>also have the ability to teleport?</b>

07:38.390 --> 07:39.960
<b>That's someone else...</b>

07:39.960 --> 07:43.310
<b>There's one who can make himself 
and those around him invisible.</b>

07:43.670 --> 07:45.500
<b>He looks like a chameleon.</b>

07:45.880 --> 07:48.780
<b>I don't know his name, but he's 
one of the Squadron Leaders.</b>

07:49.070 --> 07:50.940
<b>Which means he's a traitor!</b>

07:51.410 --> 07:56.290
<b>So you spared not only humans, 
but a traitor, as well?</b>

07:57.850 --> 07:59.760
<b>I'm willing to accept any punishment.</b>

08:00.330 --> 08:01.370
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

08:01.370 --> 08:03.830
<b>Until we've defeated them, please...</b>

08:04.110 --> 08:06.360
<b>I do not care. It is irrelevant.</b>

08:06.950 --> 08:11.940
<b>On the contrary, I believe that this is a trial</b>

08:11.940 --> 08:14.340
<b>that Chimera Ants must overcome to evolve.</b>

08:17.760 --> 08:18.660
<b>Youpi...</b>

08:19.080 --> 08:21.880
<b>We must accept your emotional instability,</b>

08:21.880 --> 08:24.130
<b>as well as the traitor's betrayal,</b>

08:24.700 --> 08:27.770
<b>as we move forward.</b>

08:28.940 --> 08:33.000
<b>Humans are a sacrifice meant to help 
us attain the next level of evolution.</b>

08:34.100 --> 08:35.740
<b>The perfect sacrifice.</b>

08:37.950 --> 08:40.730
<b>Once we arrive at the pinnacle of evolution,</b>

08:41.180 --> 08:44.170
<b>any lingering traces of the human ego will</b>

08:44.170 --> 08:46.790
<b>be nothing more than a minor wild-card trait.</b>

08:49.510 --> 08:54.500
<b>The King's opinion had completely 
reversed following the explosion.</b>

08:54.500 --> 08:56.390
<b>Was it due to the impact?</b>

08:57.790 --> 08:58.730
<b>No.</b>

08:59.320 --> 09:00.940
<b>This was the King, as well.</b>

09:02.310 --> 09:04.920
<b><i>If the enemy can become invisible,</i></b>

09:04.920 --> 09:06.460
<b><i>I can find him by making contact.</i></b>

09:07.880 --> 09:09.360
<b><i>I need to split myself</i></b>

09:09.360 --> 09:12.070
<b><i>into the smallest clones 
that can still retain sight,</i></b>

09:12.530 --> 09:14.280
<b><i>and expand the search!</i></b>

09:20.250 --> 09:21.530
<b><i>Bastard...</i></b>

09:22.020 --> 09:24.660
<b><i>Clearly, I'm not his target.</i></b>

09:25.270 --> 09:28.670
<b><i>He turned back just like that... Who is he after?</i></b>

09:31.090 --> 09:33.810
<b><i>Is he looking for the traitor, Meleoron?</i></b>

09:34.580 --> 09:36.270
<b><i>That's bad, then!</i></b>

09:37.230 --> 09:42.510
<b><i>I can't think of any way to defeat the 
King without Meleoron's ability...</i></b>

09:44.280 --> 09:47.690
<b><i>I must protect Meleoron at any cost!</i></b>

09:51.780 --> 09:56.230
<b><i>Pouf divided his clones to the point where 
they're too small for me to see.</i></b>

09:56.970 --> 09:59.360
<b><i>Unlike his main body, his clones have to be</i></b>

09:59.360 --> 10:02.070
<b><i>at full size for me to see them.</i></b>

10:06.550 --> 10:10.210
<b><i>The man with the pompadour 
was obviously just a decoy.</i></b>

10:10.920 --> 10:16.340
<b><i>They must know we've realized 
that the chameleon is a traitor.</i></b>

10:16.960 --> 10:22.720
<b><i>In other words, they believe that I've 
returned to dispose of the traitor.</i></b>

10:23.800 --> 10:29.380
<b><i>Assuming the chameleon is concealing 
himself and the others as they flee,</i></b>

10:29.380 --> 10:31.920
<b><i>and that the woman is among them,</i></b>

10:32.480 --> 10:37.110
<b><i>if I get close, they will protect the 
chameleon and abandon her!</i></b>

10:38.370 --> 10:43.240
<b><i>Because they believe the 
chameleon is my target.</i></b>

10:43.710 --> 10:46.130
<b><i>They must have never imagined that I'd return</i></b>

10:46.130 --> 10:50.210
<b><i>to kill the woman that Pitou was 
trying so desperately to heal.</i></b>

10:50.710 --> 10:56.760
<b><i>If they believe I've returned to rescue 
the woman, it's even better!</i></b>

10:57.310 --> 11:02.640
<b><i>They may even offer to hand her 
over to me with conditions.</i></b>

11:07.460 --> 11:10.690
<b>He must be after Meleoron.</b>

11:11.840 --> 11:16.050
<b>Since, from their perspective, he's a traitor.</b>

11:16.530 --> 11:17.410
<b>Hold on.</b>

11:20.170 --> 11:21.840
<b>Let's make sure.</b>

11:42.730 --> 11:44.570
<b><i>The door leading underground?</i></b>

11:46.300 --> 11:47.610
<b><i>So that's it...</i></b>

11:47.610 --> 11:50.770
<b><i>They realized that I know they 
can become invisible,</i></b>

11:50.770 --> 11:53.150
<b><i>and decided to give me two options.</i></b>

11:53.690 --> 11:58.530
<b><i>The chameleon either ran inside 
or fled somewhere else.</i></b>

11:59.280 --> 12:03.780
<b><i>Their plan is to split up my clones 
further, to weaken me.</i></b>

12:04.990 --> 12:07.240
<b>No! Over there! Over there!</b>

12:07.240 --> 12:10.660
<b>Over there! Over there! Over there!</b>

12:16.420 --> 12:17.210
<b><i>What?</i></b>

12:31.550 --> 12:33.410
<b><i>They're giving me two options.</i></b>

12:33.410 --> 12:36.810
<b><i>But they're to pursue the traitor or the woman?</i></b>

12:38.730 --> 12:42.230
<b><i>Then they want to know which is my target?</i></b>

12:43.840 --> 12:48.300
<b><i>Do I split up my clones, to hide my objective?</i></b>

12:48.820 --> 12:53.320
<b><i>Or do I send the majority of them after 
the chameleon, to fool them?</i></b>

12:55.350 --> 12:57.680
<b><i>Even if the shutter is closed,</i></b>

12:57.680 --> 13:00.340
<b><i>I can slip through it if my clones are particle-sized.</i></b>

13:00.920 --> 13:02.550
<b><i>No, I don't have time for that!</i></b>

13:08.240 --> 13:09.620
<b><i>I'll go after</i></b>

13:10.800 --> 13:11.970
<b><i>the woman!</i></b>

13:12.850 --> 13:14.730
<b><i>So she's his target?</i></b>

13:15.340 --> 13:16.860
<b><i>I only have to kill the woman</i></b>

13:16.860 --> 13:19.730
<b><i>and hide her body from the 
King for a short time.</i></b>

13:20.130 --> 13:21.330
<b><i>My clone can manage that!</i></b>

13:21.940 --> 13:23.240
<b><i>I only need a minute or two!</i></b>

13:36.280 --> 13:37.430
<b><i>He's...</i></b>

13:39.310 --> 13:42.720
<b><i>incredibly fast!</i></b>

13:44.010 --> 13:45.740
<b>Then she's your target?</b>

13:46.250 --> 13:48.190
<b>I'm up for a game of tag.</b>

13:49.550 --> 13:51.330
<b>I can go all night.</b>

13:53.480 --> 13:55.290
<b><i>Judging by how quickly he reacted,</i></b>

13:56.730 --> 14:00.140
<b><i>it would be hard to catch him, 
even at full strength.</i></b>

14:01.560 --> 14:03.420
<b><i>If I don't hurry, the King will arrive.</i></b>

14:03.850 --> 14:04.920
<b><i>What do I do?</i></b>

14:05.970 --> 14:10.450
<b>Out of options, Pouf arrived at a diabolical solution.</b>

14:11.030 --> 14:12.160
<b><i>I know!</i></b>

14:12.700 --> 14:15.410
<b><i>The greatest magic of all...</i></b>

14:18.140 --> 14:19.400
<b><i>He split himself up?</i></b>

14:19.400 --> 14:22.450
<b><i>But he won't be big enough to take her away!</i></b>

14:23.950 --> 14:27.420
<b><i>Is he going to attack me first?</i></b>

14:28.430 --> 14:30.050
<b><i>Your plan is going to backfire...</i></b>

14:31.440 --> 14:34.480
<b><i>You've reduced your speed and power,</i></b>

14:34.480 --> 14:36.180
<b><i>so I don't even need to use Godspeed.</i></b>

14:36.730 --> 14:39.170
<b>Cease this futile resistance.</b>

14:39.540 --> 14:42.820
<b>Your plans have already been thwarted!</b>

14:44.380 --> 14:48.040
<b>What is the point in adding 
to your transgressions?</b>

14:48.040 --> 14:51.570
<b>If it is fear of retribution driving 
you to flee, you needn't worry.</b>

14:52.570 --> 14:54.080
<b>The King will forgive you.</b>

14:55.150 --> 14:57.480
<b>He is a benevolent ruler.</b>

14:58.390 --> 14:59.730
<b>Don't make me laugh!</b>

14:59.730 --> 15:01.450
<b>You think I'll believe that?</b>

15:01.450 --> 15:04.950
<b>You'll probably tie me to a tree, 
and turn me into a soldier!</b>

15:06.740 --> 15:07.840
<b><i>The King?</i></b>

15:12.160 --> 15:13.270
<b><i>That's right...</i></b>

15:13.270 --> 15:14.610
<b><i>Keep running.</i></b>

15:15.040 --> 15:17.600
<b><i>Take her far from the King first!</i></b>

15:18.820 --> 15:20.310
<b><i>That confirms it...</i></b>

15:20.310 --> 15:21.600
<b><i>I don't know the reason,</i></b>

15:22.460 --> 15:25.050
<b><i>but this girl is important to the King.</i></b>

15:26.280 --> 15:28.960
<b><i>For Gon... For the sake of our mission...</i></b>

15:28.960 --> 15:31.020
<b><i>I can't let the enemy have her!</i></b>

15:32.580 --> 15:34.360
<b><i>That's right...</i></b>

15:34.360 --> 15:36.280
<b><i>The person chasing us sounded like</i></b>

15:36.280 --> 15:38.870
<b><i>one of the people with the Supreme Leader...</i></b>

15:40.070 --> 15:43.680
<b><i>Does that mean the King is the Supreme Leader?</i></b>

15:44.410 --> 15:46.010
<b><i>Then who is this person?</i></b>

15:46.450 --> 15:48.790
<b><i>Who are the people he was with?</i></b>

15:49.700 --> 15:54.390
<b>Your twisted sense of justice 
will never help the people!</b>

15:56.780 --> 15:59.000
<b><i>First, I cast a spell on the woman.</i></b>

15:59.530 --> 16:02.650
<b><i>I use magic words to make her suspicious...</i></b>

16:03.570 --> 16:07.610
<b>The King and I seek open dialogue.</b>

16:08.010 --> 16:10.900
<b>Now, release her at once!</b>

16:11.280 --> 16:14.450
<b>Bastard... That's just a bunch of baloney.</b>

16:14.450 --> 16:15.870
<b>What is he up to?</b>

16:15.870 --> 16:17.340
<b>Let me go...</b>

16:18.390 --> 16:20.640
<b>Please put me down!</b>

16:21.160 --> 16:22.790
<b>Something's wrong with you!</b>

16:23.400 --> 16:25.760
<b>You're all tingly!</b>

16:25.760 --> 16:27.630
<b>What are you talking about, fool?</b>

16:27.630 --> 16:29.760
<b>I'm trying to save you!</b>

16:29.760 --> 16:31.110
<b>You're lying!</b>

16:31.110 --> 16:32.160
<b>I'm lying?</b>

16:32.160 --> 16:34.920
<b>You trust that insect more than you trust me?</b>

16:34.920 --> 16:36.020
<b>Insect?</b>

16:36.020 --> 16:38.560
<b>What are you talking about?!</b>

16:39.940 --> 16:42.710
<b><i>That's right... She can't see!</i></b>

16:39.940 --> 16:43.470
<b>Let go! Let me go!</b>

16:42.710 --> 16:44.440
<b><i>That'll make it hard to explain.</i></b>

16:50.500 --> 16:52.800
<b><i>Damn... Almost.</i></b>

16:55.400 --> 16:57.860
<b><i>It didn't take long for the poison to kick in.</i></b>

16:57.860 --> 17:02.770
<b><i>If the woman you're carrying resists, 
your speed will also fall...</i></b>

17:05.440 --> 17:06.890
<b><i>What's going on?</i></b>

17:07.630 --> 17:10.460
<b><i>He wasn't aiming for me...</i></b>

17:10.460 --> 17:11.800
<b><i>He was aiming for the woman.</i></b>

17:13.400 --> 17:14.800
<b><i>He was trying to kill her!</i></b>

17:19.560 --> 17:21.390
<b><i>If she escapes, that's fine.</i></b>

17:21.390 --> 17:23.560
<b><i>If she distracts him with her resistance,</i></b>

17:23.890 --> 17:26.570
<b><i>allowing me to kill her, even better!</i></b>

17:28.000 --> 17:29.450
<b>Komugi-san!</b>

17:29.890 --> 17:32.690
<b>The enemies consider you a valuable hostage.</b>

17:33.370 --> 17:35.900
<b>They will not kill you...</b>

17:35.900 --> 17:37.260
<b>Keep struggling!</b>

17:37.260 --> 17:39.000
<b>Keep fighting back!</b>

17:39.770 --> 17:41.670
<b>I'll save you soon!</b>

17:49.870 --> 17:51.840
<b>She was knocked out, so that's impossible.</b>

17:52.530 --> 17:55.780
<b>Well, I have no idea what's going on here,</b>

17:56.330 --> 17:59.480
<b>but I know that you're making me mad.</b>

18:08.280 --> 18:10.180
<b>If you enter this ring,</b>

18:12.430 --> 18:13.440
<b>I'll kill you.</b>

18:27.210 --> 18:29.200
<b>You may be a clone,</b>

18:29.200 --> 18:31.630
<b>but you were formed from the original's cells.</b>

18:32.800 --> 18:35.380
<b>If I burn those cells, they die.</b>

18:36.090 --> 18:37.270
<b><i>Electricity...</i></b>

18:39.090 --> 18:42.390
<b>Come on... I'll whittle you down.</b>

18:44.720 --> 18:46.390
<b>Are you having difficulty?</b>

18:49.020 --> 18:51.150
<b>I can feel your impatience.</b>

18:51.890 --> 18:53.270
<b>I shall lend you a hand.</b>

18:54.030 --> 18:55.860
<b>It's nothing you need to worry about.</b>

18:56.420 --> 19:00.470
<b>Your first priority should be regaining 
your memories, Meruem-sama.</b>

19:01.690 --> 19:05.360
<b>Once my main body has returned, 
I can deal with the intruders easily.</b>

19:08.040 --> 19:11.290
<b>Anyway... Behold, Meruem-sama!</b>

19:13.070 --> 19:15.780
<b>Humans, as far as we can see!</b>

19:16.130 --> 19:17.800
<b>Do you remember now?</b>

19:18.500 --> 19:20.530
<b>They are all here for you...</b>

19:20.530 --> 19:22.430
<b>They all belong to you!</b>

19:23.500 --> 19:26.030
<b>They belong to me?</b>

19:26.830 --> 19:29.990
<b>You will rule these dumb, inferior creatures,</b>

19:29.990 --> 19:32.790
<b>and stand atop the food chain.</b>

19:33.460 --> 19:36.910
<b>That is your glorious destiny!</b>

19:37.900 --> 19:39.700
<b>As willed by the heavens!</b>

19:51.410 --> 19:53.990
<b>Something isn't right...</b>

19:56.020 --> 20:00.840
<b>There's still something else...</b>

20:02.050 --> 20:04.220
<b>Something else I've forgotten.</b>

20:06.130 --> 20:08.280
<b>What are you saying?</b>

20:08.280 --> 20:12.220
<b>Nothing could be more important 
than ruling over all life forms...</b>

20:13.900 --> 20:15.360
<b>I suppose.</b>

20:16.540 --> 20:19.100
<b>Perhaps the explosion has left me confused.</b>

20:20.380 --> 20:21.360
<b>However...</b>

20:25.130 --> 20:26.720
<b>The pain won't cease.</b>

20:28.890 --> 20:32.620
<b>Why is the palace in shambles?</b>

20:33.810 --> 20:36.000
<b>It was destroyed in the battle.</b>

20:37.100 --> 20:40.380
<b>It happened after you left the palace.</b>

20:41.120 --> 20:44.380
<b>Where is the place I spent most of my time in?</b>

20:45.910 --> 20:48.890
<b>It has been completely destroyed...</b>

20:52.780 --> 20:54.900
<b>I suppose I should look at what's left.</b>

20:55.350 --> 21:01.150
<b>Yes, you may find something that will 
help you regain your memories...</b>

21:05.380 --> 21:06.380
<b><i>This is bad!</i></b>

21:07.730 --> 21:08.720
<b><i>That could be it...</i></b>

21:09.170 --> 21:10.990
<b><i>The Gungi board and pieces!</i></b>

21:13.980 --> 21:16.920
<b><i>They may be the key to awakening his memory!</i></b>

21:17.750 --> 21:20.420
<b><i>I must dispose of them!</i></b>

21:25.110 --> 21:26.770
<b><i>He gave up?</i></b>

21:43.770 --> 21:44.980
<b>Over there.</b>

21:49.740 --> 21:50.710
<b>Let's go.</b>

23:24.510 --> 23:26.780
<b>Next time: Magic x Of x Despair.</b>

23:27.210 --> 23:29.120
<b>Killua, thanks.</b>

23:29.120 --> 23:30.340
<b>What's this about?</b>

23:30.340 --> 23:32.030
<b>We're buddies, right?</b>

23:32.030 --> 23:33.910
<b>Yeah, but still...</b>

23:34.470 --> 23:35.620
<b>Thanks.</b>
