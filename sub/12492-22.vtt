WEBVTT

00:07.275 --> 00:10.078
OH, YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.579
LISTEN TO SPENCER'S
LATEST STATUS UPDATE.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.482
"JUST CHILLING AT HOME."
WHO CARES?

00:16.384 --> 00:18.119
APPARENTLY YOU DO.

00:19.420 --> 00:22.190
MOM. NO NO,
I DO NOT.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.092
I COULD CARE LESS WHAT
MY EX-BOYFRIEND IS UP TO.

00:24.125 --> 00:27.061
OH, HE HASN'T EVEN CHANGED
HIS ONLINE STATUS YET.

00:27.095 --> 00:29.330
IT STILL SAYS
"IN A RELATIONSHIP."

00:29.363 --> 00:32.233
- HE JUST CAN'T LET ME GO.
- WELL, MAYBE HE FORGOT
TO CHANGE IT.

00:32.266 --> 00:35.336
UH, MOM, HOW COULD HE FORGET?
HE'S ONLINE ALL THE TIME.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.470
AND YOU KNOW THIS HOW?

00:36.504 --> 00:39.373
I CHECK HIS STATUS
EVERY HOUR.

00:39.407 --> 00:42.410
WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING
IS YOU'VE MOVED ON.

00:45.279 --> 00:48.116
GABE HONEY,
YOU HAVE A PLAYDATE
THIS AFTERNOON.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.084
- ( chuckles )
NO, I DON'T.
- YES, YOU DO.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.485
A NEW FAMILY MOVED IN
DOWN THE STREET

00:51.519 --> 00:53.187
AND THEY HAVE
A SON YOUR AGE,

00:53.221 --> 00:54.622
SO I MADE PLANS
FOR THE TWO OF YOU
TO GET TOGETHER.

00:54.655 --> 00:58.492
OH, MOM, LET ME EXPLAIN
WHERE YOU WENT WRONG.

00:58.526 --> 01:03.131
I'M 11. I DON'T HAVE
"PLAYDATES" ANYMORE.

01:03.164 --> 01:06.167
I HANG.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.369
HIS NAME IS AUSTIN
AND I THINK HE'LL BE

01:08.402 --> 01:10.638
A VERY GOOD
INFLUENCE ON YOU.
HE'S VERY WELL-BEHAVED.

01:10.671 --> 01:13.541
YOU KNOW THAT
WELL-BEHAVED AND I
ARE NATURAL ENEMIES.

01:15.143 --> 01:17.345
COULD YOU JUST BE NICE?

01:17.378 --> 01:19.480
OKAY, BE CIVIL.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.350
IT'S TOO LATE
TO CANCEL.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.287
( rock music playing )

01:26.320 --> 01:28.256
* TODAY'S ALL BURNT TOAST

01:28.289 --> 01:29.590
* RUNNING LATE,
AND DAD SAYS *

01:29.623 --> 01:32.393

01:32.426 --> 01:34.562
* I CLOSE MY EYES,
TAKE A BITE *

01:34.595 --> 01:36.397
* GRAB A RIDE,
LAUGH OUT LOUD *

01:36.430 --> 01:39.133
* THERE IT IS
UP ON THE ROOF *

01:39.167 --> 01:42.370
* I'VE BEEN THERE,
I'VE SURVIVED *

01:42.403 --> 01:45.606
* SO JUST TAKE
MY ADVICE *

01:45.639 --> 01:47.575
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

01:47.608 --> 01:49.510
* THINGS ARE CRAZY

01:49.543 --> 01:52.446
* BUT I KNOW
YOUR FUTURE'S BRIGHT *

01:52.480 --> 01:54.382
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

01:54.415 --> 01:55.883
* THERE'S NO MAYBE

01:55.916 --> 01:58.619
* EVERYTHING
TURNS OUT ALL RIGHT *

01:58.652 --> 02:01.322
* YOUR LIFE
IS UP AND DOWN *

02:01.355 --> 02:04.558
* BUT TRUST ME,
IT COMES BACK AROUND *

02:04.592 --> 02:08.662
* YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
WHO YOU TURN OUT TO BE *

02:10.331 --> 02:12.700
* HANG IN THERE, BABY.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.744
( low droning
tones playing )

02:33.387 --> 02:35.323
PLEASE DON'T BE
A PLUMBING PROBLEM.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.525
PLEASE DON'T BE
A PLUMBING PROBLEM!

02:40.294 --> 02:42.396
THANK YOU.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.534

THANKS.
UH, YOU CAN KEEP

03:39.687 --> 03:41.689
( music playing )

03:44.758 --> 03:47.461
WAIT. STOP.

03:47.495 --> 03:50.498
- THAT WAS AWFUL.
- EMMETT, DON'T BE RUDE.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.466
I'M SORRY, BUT I'M NOT
GONNA SUGARCOAT IT,

03:52.500 --> 03:53.801
EVEN IF SHE IS
MY GRANDMA.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.406
( rock music playing )

04:06.847 --> 04:09.283
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- WELL, HE'S PRETTY GOOD,

04:09.317 --> 04:10.784
BUT I'M NOT SURE
IF HE HAS THE RIGHT LOOK.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.586
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

04:12.620 --> 04:14.655
WELL, YOU AND ME
ARE SO HOT.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.757
AND HE'S SO...

04:19.327 --> 04:21.495
NOT.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.497
I CAN'T ARGUE
WITH THAT.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.799
LISTEN, JIMMY.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.602
- WE'RE GONNA THINK
ABOUT IT AND LET YOU KNOW.
- COULD YOU LET ME KNOW SOON?

04:28.636 --> 04:30.638
'CAUSE MY BROTHER'S HAVING
A PARTY THIS WEEKEND

04:30.671 --> 04:32.740
AND HE WANTS LIVE MUSIC.
HE'S WILLING TO PAY.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.876
Both:
WELCOME TO THE BAND.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.715
( doorbell rings )

04:43.484 --> 04:45.586
HEY, AUSTIN.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.588
GABE HONEY,

04:47.621 --> 04:49.457
WHAT A LOVELY HOME,
MRS. DUNCAN.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.724
SO COMFORTABLE LOOKING.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.694
WHAT A NICE WAY
OF SAYING MESSY.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.464
GABE, THIS IS AUSTIN.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.867
- HOW DO YOU DO?
- HOW DO I DO WHAT?

05:01.635 --> 05:04.872

05:04.905 --> 05:07.641

05:12.780 --> 05:15.516
THIS IS HOW YOU WANT ME
TO SPEND MY AFTERNOON?

05:15.549 --> 05:18.686
WELL, YOU BOYS HAVE FUN.
I'LL BE UPSTAIRS WITH CHARLIE.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.621
POOR LITTLE BABY'S
NOT FEELING WELL.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.757
POOR LITTLE GABY'S
NOT FEELING SO HOT EITHER.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.126
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO,
PLAY VIDEO GAMES?

05:26.159 --> 05:28.629
- OH, I'M NOT ALLOWED.
- WATCH TV?

05:28.662 --> 05:30.864
I'VE ALREADY
EXCEEDED MY ALLOTTED
ONE HOUR OF THE WEEK.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.834
- GO TO THE PARK?
- I'M NOT WEARING SUNSCREEN.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.737
HOW DO YOU THINK
THIS IS GOING?

05:38.839 --> 05:40.674
HEY, GUYS.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.643
- ( door closes )
- ( breathlessly ) HI.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.877
I DON'T BELIEVE
WE'VE MET.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.814
TEDDY, AUSTIN;
AUSTIN, TEDDY.

05:46.847 --> 05:50.684
- NICE TO MEET YOU, AUSTIN.
- THE PLEASURE IS ALL MINE.

05:50.718 --> 05:53.387
WELL, AREN'T YOU
A LITTLE GENTLEMAN?

05:56.156 --> 05:57.858
SHE'S GLORIOUS.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.793
WHAT AN EXQUISITE
CREATURE.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.932
LOOK, WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO GET THROUGH THIS.

06:04.965 --> 06:08.536
SO EITHER YOU STOP
BEING WEIRD OR--

06:09.737 --> 06:11.705
YEAH, THAT'S THE ONLY WAY.

06:17.711 --> 06:22.616
* THAT'S WHY MONKEYS
SHOULDN'T FLY *

06:23.984 --> 06:25.786
- * PLANES!
- YEAH!

06:25.819 --> 06:27.821
- YES!
- YEAH!

06:27.855 --> 06:30.991
- ( laughs )
- YEAH! THAT WAS AWE-TEOUS!

06:32.793 --> 06:34.962
- "AWE-TEOUS"?
- YEAH.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.698
I TOOK "AWESOME"
AND MASHED IT WITH
"RIGHTEOUS."

06:37.731 --> 06:38.966
"AWE-TEOUS."

06:38.999 --> 06:42.202
DUDE, I LOVE THAT.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.005
- HEY, CAN I GET
SOMETHING TO DRINK?
- YEAH, THE KITCHEN'S UPSTAIRS.

06:46.807 --> 06:50.744
- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF JIMMY?
- HE'S "GNA-TEOUS."

06:50.778 --> 06:54.848
- WHAT?
- I MASHED "GNARLY"
AND "AWE-TEOUS."

06:54.882 --> 06:57.785
"AWE-TEOUS" IS
ALREADY A MASH-UP.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.453
JUST LET HIM DO IT.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.990
CHARLIE HONEY,
DRINK YOUR JUICE.

07:03.023 --> 07:06.560
- IT'LL MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.
- NO NO.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.862
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
ARGUE WITH ME.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.464
I KNOW
A LOT MORE WORDS.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.867
MAY I HAVE
SOME WATER, PLEASE?

07:13.901 --> 07:15.936
SURE, JIMMY,
COMING RIGHT UP.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.706
WELL, AREN'T YOU
A CUTIE-PIE?

07:18.739 --> 07:21.942
I'D BE LYING IF I SAID
I HADN'T HEARD THAT BEFORE.

07:21.975 --> 07:26.580
- I-- I MEANT THE BABY.
- RIGHT. HUH.

07:26.614 --> 07:29.016
OH, JIMMY,
I WOULDN'T GET TOO CLOSE
TO CHARLIE. SHE'S...

07:29.049 --> 07:31.785
- ( sneezes )
- ...SICK.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.254
WHOA.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.791
SHE BLASTED ME
WITH SNOT.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.862
WHICH WAS ALSO THE NAME
OF MY LAST BAND.

07:46.934 --> 07:50.037
- ( doorbell rings )
- ( lasers firing on TV )

07:50.070 --> 07:53.006
IT'S AUSTIN.
TELL HIM I'M NOT HERE.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.583
SORRY, AUSTIN,
GABE'S NOT HERE.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.017
HE'S HIDING
UNDER THAT BLANKET.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.922
ACTUALLY,
I CAME TO SEE YOU.

08:11.559 --> 08:14.695
- YOU DID?
- WELL, THIS JUST
GOT INTERESTING.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.965
I BROUGHT YOU
SOME PRESENTS.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.968
AN AFRICAN ORCHID.
I CULTIVATE THEM MYSELF.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.804
I ALSO MADE YOU
SOME SOAP.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.907
- ( laughs )
- THANK YOU.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.843
I WAS RUNNING LOW
ON ORCHIDS AND SOAP.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.679
ANYTHING ELSE?

08:31.712 --> 08:33.981
I ALSO WANTED
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.684
- OKAY.
- WILL YOU GO WITH ME?

08:36.717 --> 08:38.686
GO WITH YOU WHERE?

08:38.719 --> 08:40.988
I'M ASKING YOU
TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.792
WAIT.
I-- I'M SORRY, WHAT?

08:44.825 --> 08:46.860
I'M ALMOST 16
AND YOU'RE 11.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.528
AND A HALF.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.600
I BELIEVE THERE'S
A QUESTION ON THE TABLE.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.704
TEDDY, LOVE KNOWS NO AGE.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.306
BUT IT DOES
KNOW HEIGHT.

08:59.339 --> 09:02.943
AUSTIN, I'M FLATTERED,
BUT I JUST CAME OUT
OF A RELATIONSHIP.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.846
"I HAVE LOVED,
LET US SEE IF THAT'S ALL."

09:05.879 --> 09:06.880
E.E. CUMMINGS.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.550
"I'M NOT INTERESTED."
T.R. DUNCAN.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.623
YOUR WORDS SAY ONE THING,
BUT YOUR EYES SAY ANOTHER.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.793
OKAY.
FOCUS ON MY HANDS.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.795
THEY'RE PUSHING YOU
OUT THE DOOR.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.065
THIS IS NOT OVER.
I SHALL RETURN!

09:28.068 --> 09:30.938
YOU KNOW,
HE'S GROWING ON ME.

09:36.043 --> 09:39.880
- I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.
WHAT'S THE BAD NEWS?
- JIMMY'S SICK.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.783
CHARLIE SNEEZED ON HIM.
NOW HE CAN'T MAKE THE GIG
THIS WEEKEND.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.686
- MAN, THAT'S "AWF-ABLE."
- STOP THAT!

09:47.187 --> 09:49.623
DUDE, WE HAVE GOT TO FIND
A NEW BASS PLAYER AND FAST.

09:49.657 --> 09:50.924
- BUT WHERE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.794
( bass music playing )

10:02.069 --> 10:04.772
- DAD?
- HEY.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.707
OH SORRY.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.676
I SAW IT HERE.
I COULDN'T RESIST.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.044
- HOW'D YOU LEARN TO DO THAT?
- WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

10:11.078 --> 10:14.782
I HAD MY OWN BAND--
THE BOB DUNCAN EXPERIENCE.

10:14.815 --> 10:18.051
YOU WERE IN A BAND?
HOW COME I NEVER KNEW THAT?

10:18.085 --> 10:19.987
BECAUSE WHENEVER
I START A STORY

10:20.020 --> 10:22.756
WITH "WHEN I WAS
IN HIGH SCHOOL,"
YOU ZONE OUT.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.026
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

10:27.861 --> 10:30.097
WELL, MR. D.,
YOU ARE THE ANSWERS
TO OUR PRAYERS.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.833
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE--
( mumbles )

10:32.866 --> 10:34.201
BAND MEETING.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.203
BAND MEETING?

10:36.236 --> 10:38.939
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.841
THAT'S HOW
I GOT THROWN OUT

10:40.874 --> 10:43.210
OF THE BOB DUNCAN
EXPERIENCE.

10:43.243 --> 10:46.847
EMMETT, I DON'T WANT
TO BE THE LOSER WHO'S
IN A BAND WITH HIS DAD.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.716
A LITTLE QUIETER, GUYS.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.852
( whispering )
I KNOW HE'S OLD,

10:51.885 --> 10:52.953
BUT WHAT CHOICE
DO WE HAVE?

10:52.986 --> 10:55.255
STILL HEARING IT.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.092
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.228
DAD...

11:01.261 --> 11:03.731
DO YOU WANT TO DO
THE GIG WITH US?

11:03.764 --> 11:06.867
YES!
THE EXPERIENCE CONTINUES!

11:06.900 --> 11:08.702
I'M BACK!

11:08.736 --> 11:10.838
FOR ONE GIG ONLY.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.173
FOR ONE GIG ONLY!

11:17.177 --> 11:19.179
( chatting )

11:27.955 --> 11:30.991
"YOU ARE THE LIGHT
OF MY LIFE. AUSTIN.

11:31.024 --> 11:34.494
P.S., NOT TO BE USED
IN NON-VENTILATED AREAS."

11:34.527 --> 11:37.965
YEP, THAT'S
MY SPECIAL FELLA.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.135
- HEY.
- HEY.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.107
OKAY. SPENCER, UH,

11:47.140 --> 11:50.844
THIS IS AWKWARD,
BUT I HAVE TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

11:50.878 --> 11:54.815
- SURE, WHAT IS IT?
- WELL, I HEARD YOUR
ONLINE STATUS

11:54.848 --> 11:56.283
SAYS YOU'RE
IN A RELATIONSHIP--

11:56.316 --> 11:58.118
SOMEBODY TOLD ME,
I DON'T REMEMBER WHO--

11:58.151 --> 12:01.088
SO YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY CHANGE THAT.

12:01.121 --> 12:04.792
- I'M JUST SAYING.
- ACTUALLY, I DID CHANGE IT

12:04.825 --> 12:07.761
- AND THEN I CHANGED IT BACK.
- HUH. OKAY LOOK,

12:07.795 --> 12:09.296
I KNOW YOU STILL
HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME.

12:09.329 --> 12:12.800
I GET IT. I HAVE
THAT EFFECT ON PEOPLE.

12:12.833 --> 12:16.036
BUT REALLY, IT'S TIME
TO MOVE ON, OKAY?

12:16.069 --> 12:18.038
TEDDY, MY STATUS
ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.174
I-- OH.

12:21.208 --> 12:24.244
HER NAME'S NICOLE.
WE'VE HAD A FEW DATES.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.179
SHE DOESN'T GO
TO OUR SCHOOL.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.949
WELL, THAT'S--
THAT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.184
I MEAN IT'S GOOD
FOR BOTH OF US, ACTUALLY,

12:31.218 --> 12:33.186
BECAUSE I'M ALSO
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.088
- YOU ARE?
- YES.

12:35.122 --> 12:38.158
- COOL. WHO IS IT?
- UH, AUSTIN...

12:38.191 --> 12:40.127
IS HIS NAME.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.162
AUSTIN DOESN'T GO
TO OUR SCHOOL.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.164
HE...

12:44.197 --> 12:46.333
GOT ME THIS CANDLE.
WHATEVER.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.201
AH. THAT'S NICE.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.203
YEAH, HE'S THOUGHTFUL
LIKE THAT.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.139
( cell phone
playing tune )

12:53.206 --> 12:55.108
AH. IT'S NICOLE.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.811
- I SHOULD
PROBABLY TAKE THIS.
- OH SURE. GO FOR IT.

12:57.845 --> 13:00.347
( shouts )
I HAVE TO CALL
AUSTIN ANYWAY...

13:00.380 --> 13:03.083
( mutters )
ONCE HE'S OLD ENOUGH
TO HAVE A PHONE.

13:12.860 --> 13:15.195
HEY, TE-- OH.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.898
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE
NOT STILL OBSESSING
ABOUT SPENCER.

13:17.931 --> 13:21.201
NO NO, I'M OBSESSING
ABOUT SOME GIRL NAMED NICOLE

13:21.234 --> 13:23.070
WHO HE'S SUPPOSEDLY DATING.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.104
BUT I DON'T THINK
SHE EXISTS.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.106
I JUST SCROLLED THROUGH
ALL 452 OF HIS FRIENDS

13:26.139 --> 13:29.309
AND THERE'S
NOT ONE NICOLE.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.278
YOU THINK HE MADE UP
A FAKE GIRLFRIEND

13:31.311 --> 13:33.046
JUST TO GET A RISE
OUT OF YOU?

13:33.080 --> 13:35.849
OH, THAT IS SAD
AND PATHETIC.

13:37.617 --> 13:40.854
WELL, IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS

13:40.888 --> 13:43.256
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.859
WHAT'S YOUR
FAKE BOYFRIEND'S NAME?

13:45.893 --> 13:47.227
AUSTIN.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.196
- OH TEDDY.
- I PANICKED!

13:49.229 --> 13:51.264
AT LEAST
HE'S A REAL GUY.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.633
- Austin: FOR YOU, MY LOVE!
- ( folk music playing )

13:53.666 --> 13:55.402
IS THAT THE LUTE?

13:56.904 --> 13:59.139
OH, I LOVE THE LUTE.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.211
( sighs )

14:04.244 --> 14:06.346
SORRY, AUSTIN.
NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.415
TEDDY, GO OUT WITH ME.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.318
- NO.
- THEN I WILL CONTINUE
TO SERENADE YOU

14:11.351 --> 14:13.320
WITH EVERY INSTRUMENT
AT MY DISPOSAL.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.156
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW

14:16.189 --> 14:18.391
MY FATHER OWNS
A MUSIC STORE.

14:18.425 --> 14:21.294
SO WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE
TO MAKE YOU GO AWAY?

14:21.328 --> 14:23.163
ONE DATE.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.198
OKAY, FINE.
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.300
WELL, NOT NOW.
I'M NOT DRESSED.

14:27.334 --> 14:30.037
I SHALL RETURN
SATURDAY AFTERNOON.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.405
- SHALL WE SAY 1:00-ISH?
- SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.975
OUR RELATIONSHIP ENDS
AT 3:00-ISH.

14:35.008 --> 14:38.145
UNTIL THEN I BID YOU
A GENTLE GOOD MORROW.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.351
YAHOO!

14:49.222 --> 14:52.092
DAD! COME ON,
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT YOU.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.897
HUH? LOOK AT THAT.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.068
CAN I PASS
FOR A TEENAGER?

15:01.101 --> 15:03.370
ABSOLUTELY.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.273
JUST STAY OUT
OF DIRECT LIGHT...

15:08.208 --> 15:10.443
OR ANY LIGHT.
( laughs )

15:12.379 --> 15:15.448
- IS THAT A ZIT?
- YEP, DREW THAT ON MYSELF.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.684
MAKES ME
LOOK YOUNGER, HUH?

15:17.717 --> 15:21.388
UGH. PUTTING A LOT
OF PRESSURE ON ONE
LITTLE ZIT, DAD.

15:23.456 --> 15:26.226
OKAY. DAD.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.062
- LET'S GO OVER IT
ONE MORE TIME.
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.298
MY NAME IS BO.
I GO TO NORTH HIGH

15:31.331 --> 15:34.434
AND, IF ANYBODY ASKS, I HAVE
A BIZARRE MEDICAL CONDITION

15:34.467 --> 15:37.337
- THAT MAKES ME LOOK OLDER.
- CALLED?

15:37.370 --> 15:40.240
OLD-MAN-ITUS.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.277
WE'RE GOOD.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.379
OH, HONEY.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.985
WANT TO GO OUT
WITH A TEENAGER TONIGHT?

15:52.019 --> 15:54.321
NOT WITH THAT ZIT.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.428
- THIS IS OUR DATE?
- ( party horn blows )

16:01.461 --> 16:04.297
YOUR SIX-YEAR-OLD COUSIN'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY?

16:04.331 --> 16:06.466
I COULDN'T SHOW UP
WITHOUT A DATE.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.368
THAT WOULD BE
EMBARRASSING.

16:08.401 --> 16:12.305
WE WOULDN'T WANT ANYONE HERE
TO BE EMBARRASSED.

16:12.339 --> 16:16.543
OH, NO, I'VE ARRANGED
A PRIVATE TABLE FOR US.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.046
HOW ROMANTIC.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.484
I SLIPPED THE CLOWN
A FEW DOLLARS.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.186
HE'LL BE BY SHORTLY.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.293
COME ON, SWING LIKE
YOU MEAN IT!

16:33.326 --> 16:36.496
SHE'S GONNA BE
SEVEN BY THE TIME
WE GET OUT OF HERE.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.531
IT WON'T TAKE THAT LONG.

16:38.565 --> 16:41.034
AFTER THE PINATA,
WE HAVE CAKE

16:41.068 --> 16:43.136
- THEN WE KISS
AND IT'S OVER.
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

16:43.170 --> 16:45.072
WE HAVE CAKE.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.573
UH, IT'S YOUR TURN.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.475
AH. LET'S DO THIS.

16:51.844 --> 16:55.448
OPEN YOUR BAGS, GIRLS.
THIS PRETTY RAINBOW'S
GOING DOWN.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.320
( girls cheer )

17:00.353 --> 17:02.589
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT! WHOO!

17:02.622 --> 17:05.492
- TEDDY?
- OH! SPENCER.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.260
THAT IS YOU,
UH, TIGER.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.596
- HOW DO YOU DO?
- OH MY GOSH.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.431
HOW DO I DO WHAT?

17:11.464 --> 17:15.268
- I'M AUSTIN.
- THIS IS AUSTIN?

17:15.302 --> 17:16.603
THE GUY YOU'RE
IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH?

17:16.636 --> 17:18.205
WELL, IT'S JUST
OUR FIRST DATE.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.307
WE'RE TAKING THINGS SLOW.

17:20.340 --> 17:23.610
UM, WELL, I SHOULD GO.
NICOLE'S WAITING FOR ME.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.346
- IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU.
- AND YOU, SIR.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.386
( horn blows )

17:33.420 --> 17:35.222
ARE YOU OKAY?

17:36.523 --> 17:38.491
NOT REALLY.

17:38.525 --> 17:41.228
THAT WAS
MY EX-BOYFRIEND.

17:41.261 --> 17:44.231
- OH.
- HE'S HERE WITH NICOLE,

17:44.264 --> 17:47.267
WHO IS PRETTY
AND REAL.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.402
AND YOU'RE HERE
WITH AN 11-YEAR-OLD.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.504
PRETTY MUCH.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.573
WELL, YOU KNOW, TEDDY,

17:55.575 --> 17:57.377
I MAY BE ONLY 11,

17:57.410 --> 17:59.479
BUT I'M OLD ENOUGH
TO KNOW YOU DESERVE SOMEONE

17:59.512 --> 18:01.648
WHO WILL APPRECIATE
HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.351
AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
SPENCER AIN'T IT.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.354
- DID YOU JUST SAY "AIN'T"?
- LISTEN TO ME.

18:07.387 --> 18:10.223
I'M SO PASSIONATE,
I'M THROWING GRAMMAR
TO THE WIND.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.326
YEAH THANKS, AUSTIN.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.128
AND YOU KNOW,
AS FIRST DATES GO,

18:15.162 --> 18:16.463
THIS WASN'T
ALL THAT BAD.

18:16.496 --> 18:19.166
- NOT NOW, SLAPPY.
- ( squeaks )

18:21.168 --> 18:23.236
ANYWAY, YOU REALLY--

18:23.270 --> 18:24.671
YOU DESERVE
SOMEBODY GREAT TOO.

18:24.704 --> 18:27.240
I MEAN,
SOMEBODY WHO'S SMART

18:27.274 --> 18:31.378
KIND AND, WELL, 11.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.413
SHALL WE GRAB
OUR GOODY BAGS,
QUICK KISS

18:33.446 --> 18:35.148
- AND GET OUT OF HERE?
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

18:35.182 --> 18:37.384
I SAID LET'S GRAB
OUR GOODY BAGS.

18:41.588 --> 18:46.326
* THAT'S WHY
MONKEYS SHOULDN'T FLY *

18:47.660 --> 18:49.596
* PLANES!

18:49.629 --> 18:53.166
( chatting )

18:53.200 --> 18:55.635
THIS IS AWFUL.
WE'RE TOTALLY BOMBING.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.537
THEY'RE NOT EVEN
PAYING ATTENTION TO US.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.639
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
CALM DOWN.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.708
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I LEARNED FROM THE BOB
DUNCAN EXPERIENCE,

19:01.741 --> 19:03.943
IT'S THAT IF YOU WANT
TO GET PEOPLE TO NOTICE YOU,

19:03.976 --> 19:06.413
- YOU GIVE THEM
SOMETHING TO NOTICE.
- HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

19:06.446 --> 19:09.916
BAND MEETING.
OKAY, GUYS, FOLLOW MY LEAD.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.584
THIS CROWD'S ABOUT
TO GET FIRED UP.

19:11.618 --> 19:14.287
( rock music playing )

19:27.700 --> 19:29.402
( cheering )

19:38.245 --> 19:41.648
* MY MOUTH IS ON FIRE!

19:41.681 --> 19:44.617
* MY MOUTH IS
ON FIRE! *

19:44.651 --> 19:48.655
* MY MOUTH IS ON FIRE!

19:48.688 --> 19:53.293
- * FIRE!
- ( cheering )

20:04.404 --> 20:06.273
Well, Charlie,

20:06.306 --> 20:08.375
thanks to a strange
little dude named Austin,

20:08.408 --> 20:10.243
I think I'm finally
over Spencer.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.645
In fact, I'm about
to defriend him right now.

20:12.679 --> 20:15.248
- ( chimes )
- Whoo! Moving on.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.683
- Feel good.
- ( chimes )

20:16.716 --> 20:19.986
Ooh, looks like
I have an email from...

20:20.019 --> 20:22.355
Austin.

20:23.823 --> 20:27.527
Oh, he posted
the Teddy the tiger pictures

20:27.560 --> 20:29.362
all over
the internet.

20:31.298 --> 20:32.832
Wish me good luck,
Charlie.

20:34.801 --> 20:38.471
- ( chuckles )
- WHOA! WHAT HAPPENED?

20:38.505 --> 20:41.741
DAD BREATHED FIRE.
IT WAS SO AWESOME...

20:43.310 --> 20:44.677
THE FIRST TIME.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.713
THE SECOND TIME
THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.716
NO BIG DEAL.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.584
TOMORROW MORNING I'LL GO
DOWN TO THE MUSIC STORE

20:51.618 --> 20:52.819
AND GET JIMMY A NEW BASS,

20:52.852 --> 20:54.721
THEN GO OVER
TO THE LUMBER YARD

20:54.754 --> 20:57.690
AND GET JIMMY'S PARENTS
A NEW DECK.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.827
WAIT. DAD, YOU PLAYED
IN P.J.'s BAND?

21:00.860 --> 21:03.630
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE INTO MUSIC.
- OF COURSE I AM.

21:03.663 --> 21:06.366
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,
I HAD MY OWN BAND.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.836
I'M SORRY, WHAT?

21:11.704 --> 21:14.674
I REALLY GOT TO GET
MY OWN PLACE.

21:24.351 --> 21:26.586
HEY!
( laughs )

21:26.619 --> 21:28.555
LOOK AT THAT.
AIN'T SHE A BEAUTY?

21:28.588 --> 21:30.790
I THOUGHT YOU ALREADY
BOUGHT JIMMY A BASS.

21:30.823 --> 21:34.361
- THIS IS FOR ME.
- DAD, UM,

21:34.394 --> 21:36.329
I THOUGHT WE MADE IT
PRETTY CLEAR

21:36.363 --> 21:38.531
YOU BEING IN THE BAND WAS
JUST A ONE-TIME THING.

21:38.565 --> 21:41.601
- I'M SORRY.
- I'M NOT.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.436
I'VE GOT
MY OWN BAND NOW.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.472
( rock music playing )

21:50.643 --> 21:52.379
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY WHOA.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.681
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
STOP STOP STOP.

21:54.714 --> 21:56.516
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN,
ALL RIGHT?

21:56.549 --> 21:58.117
LET'S BRING THE ACCORDION
DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.720
A LITTLE MORE FROM YOU.
A LITTLE LESS FROM YOU.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.722
AND AS FOR
EMMETT'S GRANDMA...

22:07.827 --> 22:10.463
YOU SOUND GREAT.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.831
AHEM. ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.634
ONE MORE TIME FROM THE TOP.
OKAY, ON THREE.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.669
( drums playing
energetically )

22:19.939 --> 22:22.909
- ( drums stop )
I SAID, "ON THREE." ON.

22:25.512 --> 22:28.581
( giggles )

22:28.615 --> 22:30.550
OH, THAT'S RIGHT. YOU--

22:30.583 --> 22:32.585
YOU CAN'T COUNT
TO THREE YET.

22:32.619 --> 22:34.954
( theme music playing )
