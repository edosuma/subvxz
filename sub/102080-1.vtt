00:14.182 --> 00:16.884
(rushing waters)

00:25.359 --> 00:28.362
(slow gentle music)

00:30.030 --> 00:32.700
(woman humming)

00:42.843 --> 00:46.480
* My love

00:46.480 --> 00:50.384
* Is alone

00:50.384 --> 00:55.356
* With you

00:58.726 --> 01:02.396
* So you wait in that sea

01:02.396 --> 01:05.433
* Caught up and free

01:13.207 --> 01:15.008
* With me

01:15.008 --> 01:17.678
* And I dream

01:17.678 --> 01:21.682
* Nothing's what
it seems to be *

01:27.788 --> 01:31.859
* I love

01:31.892 --> 01:35.563
* Is alone

01:35.563 --> 01:37.765
* With you

01:44.605 --> 01:47.241
(ominous music)

01:55.816 --> 01:58.619
(heavy breathing)

02:11.232 --> 02:12.065
(dramatic music)
(water splashes)

02:12.065 --> 02:14.402
(Liz gasps)

02:19.673 --> 02:20.841
- [Liz] Brody.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.319
(ominous music)

02:38.091 --> 02:40.928
(coffee bubbling)

03:03.684 --> 03:06.186
(tense music)

03:14.528 --> 03:15.796
- [Payton] Stop!

03:15.829 --> 03:16.864
Stop, please!

03:16.864 --> 03:18.499
Someone help, please!

03:18.532 --> 03:20.033
Help me, please help!

03:20.033 --> 03:21.235
Hurry!

03:21.235 --> 03:25.038
Hurry Liz, don't!
(Liz sniffling)

03:25.038 --> 03:27.375
(Liz cries)

03:33.714 --> 03:34.548
(ominous music)

03:34.548 --> 03:37.385
(heavy breathing)

03:47.227 --> 03:49.997
- [Therapist] Were you able
to get any sleep this week?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.066
- A couple of hours, maybe.

03:54.702 --> 03:55.503
- The nightmare?

03:57.405 --> 04:00.073
- Getting progressively worse.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.742
I got taken under this time.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.576
- Oh no.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.212
Then?

04:05.245 --> 04:06.079
- Then I woke up.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.684
I have this feeling of dread,

04:10.684 --> 04:12.353
as if it's building
to something.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.055
- [Therapist] Yeah?

04:16.457 --> 04:18.959
- Sometimes I feel like I'm
gonna lose it completely.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.364
- I understand.

04:23.397 --> 04:27.267
Lack of sleep can be tough
on the mind and the body.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.370
You still certain you don't

04:29.403 --> 04:31.071
want to be prescribed
to anything?

04:31.071 --> 04:33.073
- I don't want anything, no.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.975
I'm almost more terrified
of what I'll see

04:34.975 --> 04:36.377
if I actually can't wake up.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.482
- [Therapist] How are the
meditation exercises going?

04:41.482 --> 04:43.551
- Well, I'm doing them.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.285
- That's good.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.120
- I guess.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.159
It's been a year now.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.262
- [Therapist] A year?

04:56.430 --> 04:57.498
- Since the attack.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.101
- Yes, of course.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.606
How do you feel about that?

05:05.639 --> 05:06.807
- Shitty, obviously.

05:07.975 --> 05:08.809
- Right.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.311
- Alone.

05:15.282 --> 05:16.950
- Do you still blame yourself?

05:18.986 --> 05:21.489
(tense music)

05:25.993 --> 05:28.662
(phone ringing)

05:31.665 --> 05:32.766
- Hey.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.602
- [Roberta] Hey, beautiful.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.136
How ya doing?

05:36.136 --> 05:40.541
- Oh, you know, tired, headache.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.375
The usual.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.311
- [Roberta] How
was your session?

05:44.344 --> 05:45.679
- Oh, swell.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.015
"How does that make you feel?

05:48.048 --> 05:51.284
"And how do you feel
about that?" all day.

05:51.318 --> 05:54.822
- [Roberta] And how do
you feel about that?

05:54.822 --> 05:56.390
- Shut up jerk face.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.958
- [Roberta] I am
not a jerk face.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.160
- You're a part-time jerk face.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.061
- [Roberta] Yeah?

06:01.061 --> 06:02.696
And the other part-time I'm a

06:02.696 --> 06:05.466
luscious, righteous,
goddess, right?

06:05.499 --> 06:06.333
- Right.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.970
How was your day luscious?

06:09.970 --> 06:12.640
- [Roberta] You know
me, I slay all day.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.342
- You did not just
say slay all day.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.577
- [Roberta] I did.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.911
- You didn't.

06:17.978 --> 06:18.846
- [Roberta] I did though.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.047
- I hate you.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.381
- [Roberta] You love me.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.016
- You suck!

06:23.016 --> 06:24.852
- [Roberta] Only if he let me.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.920
(Roberta laughs)

06:26.920 --> 06:29.923
Hey, let me take
you out tonight.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.592
Let's go do something fun.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.494
(Liz sighs)

06:33.527 --> 06:36.196
- I don't really feel
like going anywhere.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.198
I'm already lounging.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.901
- [Roberta] Ah, it's one of
those kinds of days, huh?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.704
- Pretty much.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.272
- [Roberta] Okay.

06:45.272 --> 06:49.076
Then let me come over
and make you dinner.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.545
- I certainly won't
argue against that.

06:51.579 --> 06:52.680
- [Roberta] Shocker!

06:54.414 --> 06:56.517
I'll be by around six.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.586
- Sounds good.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.387
- [Roberta] See
you then beautiful.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.389
- Bye, luscious goddess.

07:08.395 --> 07:11.064
(clock chiming)

07:29.049 --> 07:31.719
(ominous music)

07:49.970 --> 07:52.105
(Liz screams)
(dramatic music)

07:52.105 --> 07:54.942
(heavy breathing)

08:12.760 --> 08:14.461
- [Roberta] So.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.328
- So.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.497
- What do you think?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.466
- It was a'ight.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.634
- I'll do better next time.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.269
- Could you please?

08:22.269 --> 08:23.170
- Okay.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.639
- It was amazing, thank you.

08:28.141 --> 08:28.976
- My pleasure.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.212
- Oh no, I'll do that.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.314
- Nada, I got this.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.182
You chillax.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.321
(water running)

08:41.354 --> 08:43.691
Hey, wanna watch a movie?

08:43.691 --> 08:45.192
- Maybe, what are you thinking?

08:46.526 --> 08:48.696
- I don't know, something funny.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.131
Got us a little party favor.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.299
- Ah.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.734
(Liz chuckles)

08:53.734 --> 08:55.569
You know I'm not down
on the devils lettuce.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.971
- Still scared of
the reefer madness?

08:58.005 --> 09:00.841
- I'm terrified of those
herbal jazz cigarettes.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.810
- Oh, come on, it's
just ganja, babe.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.545
I keep telling you this
will help you sleep.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.547
- I know, but-

09:07.547 --> 09:09.583
- [Roberta] How are you
sleeping by the way?

09:09.650 --> 09:10.417
Any better?

09:11.852 --> 09:13.721
- Not really.

09:13.721 --> 09:16.990
I managed maybe a couple
of shitty hours a night.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.392
- Oh babe.

09:21.361 --> 09:24.031
I'm so sorry, that really sucks.

09:26.734 --> 09:29.737
You know, what's great
to help you sleep?

09:29.737 --> 09:31.605
Keep all the bad dreams away?

09:31.672 --> 09:32.439
- What's that?

09:32.439 --> 09:34.842
(Liz laughs)

09:38.045 --> 09:39.713
- Making sweet love by the fire.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.950
- My fireplace is broken.

09:45.719 --> 09:48.388
Making sweet love will
keep the sharks away?

09:48.388 --> 09:50.724
- Oh yeah, they hate the sound.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.460
(women giggling)

09:58.231 --> 09:59.266
- I'm sorry.

10:01.101 --> 10:01.935
I can't.

10:01.935 --> 10:02.970
I don't know.

10:05.072 --> 10:05.906
- It's okay.

10:06.907 --> 10:07.708
I understand.

10:12.646 --> 10:15.282
(Liz sighs)

10:15.282 --> 10:16.116
- Do you?

10:16.984 --> 10:17.818
- Of course.

10:20.053 --> 10:23.056
- I don't feel ready
to go there yet.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.257
- I know.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.292
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to make you feel-

10:25.292 --> 10:27.227
- No, no, no, no
don't say sorry.

10:27.227 --> 10:31.098
You've been nothing but
amazing and patient with me.

10:31.131 --> 10:34.301
I don't know who would
put up with waiting-

10:34.301 --> 10:35.302
- Four months.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.270
- Has it been?

10:38.471 --> 10:39.673
- Yeah.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.241
Not that I noticed or anything.

10:42.776 --> 10:43.643
- Yeah right.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.117
- We can just cuddle
and watch a movie.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.085
- I'll take it.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.756
(slow gentle music)

10:55.756 --> 10:56.990
- I just wanna be here.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.093
- I'm glad you're here.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.473
(ominous music)

11:20.147 --> 11:22.983
(heavy breathing)

11:23.016 --> 11:23.884
Oh God, no.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.666
(tense music)

11:53.713 --> 11:56.416
(dramatic music)

11:57.918 --> 11:59.519
(Liz gasps)

11:59.552 --> 12:02.255
(heavy breathing)

12:04.491 --> 12:05.893
- Hey.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.060
Hey.

12:07.094 --> 12:07.928
Hey, it's okay.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.197
It's okay.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.499
- [Therapist] It
must be nice to have

12:12.499 --> 12:14.067
someone who supports you, yes?

12:14.067 --> 12:16.569
- Of course, it's great.

12:16.603 --> 12:17.604
Almost too great.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.573
- And what do you mean by that?

12:21.741 --> 12:25.512
- You know, just
too good to be true.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.214
- Ah, yes.

12:28.415 --> 12:32.119
- She's just so
loving and sweet.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.221
I feel like a total
asshole by comparison.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.359
- Well, when you're
going through something,

12:39.359 --> 12:41.228
it sounds like she
understands that.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.095
- She does,

12:43.430 --> 12:47.935
but I'm always wary of
anyone who seems too perfect.

12:47.935 --> 12:51.471
You know, meanwhile, here
I am an emotional mess who

12:55.042 --> 12:57.710
can't even get
intimate with her.

12:57.710 --> 13:01.248
- Has she expressed any
feelings to you about that?

13:01.281 --> 13:04.952
- No, not really.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.121
I mean, she seems
disappointed at times,

13:08.121 --> 13:09.890
but who wouldn't, right?

13:15.062 --> 13:17.164
Every time we get close,

13:18.098 --> 13:19.099
I just can't.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.670
- [Therapist] Have you
been with women before?

13:24.604 --> 13:25.605
- Yeah.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.607
In college I dated both,

13:28.976 --> 13:32.913
but Seth was my first real
long-term relationship though.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.618
Why did you think I-

13:38.651 --> 13:41.321
- Oh, just asking.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.291
- Yeah, no, it's,
it's not that at all.

13:45.825 --> 13:46.860
It's more like,

13:48.095 --> 13:49.930
this wall I can't break through.

13:51.865 --> 13:55.602
Almost as if he won't let me.

13:57.470 --> 13:58.671
- Who?

13:58.671 --> 13:59.472
Seth?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.542
- Maybe, or,

14:03.676 --> 14:04.511
the shark?

14:06.846 --> 14:11.151
I don't know, that sounds
ridiculous and bat shit.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.988
- That does not sound
ridiculous and bat shit.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.957
It makes sense in a way.

14:16.957 --> 14:17.790
- It does?

14:19.226 --> 14:21.895
A shark not wanting
me to be intimate?

14:22.795 --> 14:23.663
- Why not?

14:24.998 --> 14:27.334
It doesn't want to lose
its power over you.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.037
If you let yourself go and
become intimate with someone,

14:30.037 --> 14:33.506
you may feel better, if you
feel better, you may relax,

14:33.540 --> 14:34.741
if you relax, you may-

14:34.741 --> 14:36.743
- I may not have
the dreams anymore.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.311
Right, right.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.013
- I'm just tossing ideas around.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.483
the human mind is very complex.

14:43.483 --> 14:44.985
- Isn't it though?

14:44.985 --> 14:47.988
I just want to be able to shut
it off and be able to sleep.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.822
- Well, have you been
doing the meditation?

14:49.856 --> 14:51.824
- The meditations, yes.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.326
I thought exercise
would help too,

14:53.326 --> 14:55.728
but I'm just so damn
tired all the time.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.068
- Have you given any
more thought to the pool?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.670
- No.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.338
No way, not ready for that.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.209
- [Therapist] Okay, no
problem, understood.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.581
- I'll get there, just not yet.

15:16.549 --> 15:17.384
- Understood.

15:19.953 --> 15:23.623
Is next week at eight
still good for you?

15:23.690 --> 15:25.625
- Yes, it should be.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.694
- I have an appointment
next Wednesday,

15:27.727 --> 15:29.062
if that works for you.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.466
My dog, Ryan has an appointment
on our usual Tuesday, so.

15:34.901 --> 15:37.070
- Your dog's name is Ryan?

15:37.104 --> 15:38.938
- Yeah, kinda funny, right?

15:38.938 --> 15:41.208
He was my brother's first,
(ominous music)

15:41.241 --> 15:42.709
so he came to me named.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.377
So I'll go ahead
and put you down.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.383
(Liz screams)

15:50.383 --> 15:51.818
Oh my God, are you okay?

15:51.818 --> 15:52.652
What happened?

15:52.719 --> 15:54.487
(heavy breathing)

15:54.487 --> 15:55.989
Okay, just breathe, breathe.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.292
Everything is fine.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.827
What did you see?

16:00.893 --> 16:01.728
- I,

16:03.663 --> 16:04.497
I can't.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.100
I can't.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.935
- Okay, okay, just
breathe and relax.

16:09.969 --> 16:10.803
- Whoa.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.772
I'm so sorry.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.007
- No, do not apologize.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.842
- This is really
embarrassing, I-

16:15.842 --> 16:17.077
- No, no, not now.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.847
- I should go.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.351
Apparently I'm seeing shit now.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.185
I

16:27.987 --> 16:30.690
saw a shark in the window.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.100
- You mean out there?

16:40.133 --> 16:41.501
- Yeah.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.002
It was swimming towards you,

16:43.002 --> 16:45.972
moving through the
air like water.

16:46.939 --> 16:47.774
Oh wow!

16:49.176 --> 16:51.111
I need to fucking
sleep, don't I?

16:56.516 --> 16:57.950
Am I going crazy?

16:58.951 --> 17:00.453
- No, you're not.

17:00.487 --> 17:03.723
Like I said, lack of sleep
can be brutal on the mind.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.360
I'm going to recommend
you to a colleague

17:07.360 --> 17:08.561
that can prescribe you some-

17:08.628 --> 17:09.462
- No!

17:11.364 --> 17:12.232
No pills.

17:14.734 --> 17:15.568
- Okay.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.205
I understand, no pills.

17:21.408 --> 17:24.077
(ominous music)

17:34.087 --> 17:35.088
- [Payton] Help!

17:35.088 --> 17:35.922
Help please!

17:35.922 --> 17:37.590
Someone help, please!

17:37.590 --> 17:39.192
Help me, please help!

17:39.226 --> 17:44.231
Hurry, hurry Liz, help!
(ominous music)

18:13.793 --> 18:16.696
(machine whirring)

18:31.077 --> 18:32.645
- Excuse me.

18:32.645 --> 18:33.480
Excuse me.

18:34.647 --> 18:35.482
Excuse me!

18:39.319 --> 18:40.253
It's Hector. Right?

18:42.289 --> 18:43.089
- Javier.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.591
- Javier, right.

18:44.591 --> 18:47.294
Hey look, Javier, I know
you're doing your job,

18:47.294 --> 18:50.563
but could you maybe do it later?

18:50.597 --> 18:52.299
Or better yet tomorrow

18:52.299 --> 18:54.066
or never?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.136
(Liz chuckles)

18:57.136 --> 18:59.439
It's just, I have a really bad
headache from lack of sleep

18:59.472 --> 19:01.308
and it's especially
bad right now.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.477
I would really appreciate it.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.179
I could maybe even
give you some money.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.079
- I can't do it.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.014
I have to finish.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.148
- Well, maybe, I don't know.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.451
You could use a rake.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.652
- [Javier] Huh?

19:12.652 --> 19:14.120
- You know, a rake.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.288
What you're supposed to use

19:15.288 --> 19:17.190
after you've gathered
up the leaves.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.592
- I can't do it, I no have.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.793
- You don't have a rake?

19:23.029 --> 19:24.864
So then what the...

19:24.864 --> 19:26.766
What are you even doing then?

19:26.799 --> 19:29.602
You're just blowing leaves in
dirt from one yard to another.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.338
You're not cleaning shit.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.672
You're just spreading
dirt everywhere

19:32.705 --> 19:34.874
and disturbing everyone's peace!

19:34.874 --> 19:36.276
And it helps nothing.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.477
Does it make you
feel good to know

19:37.510 --> 19:39.646
you are literally
doing nothing useful?

19:39.646 --> 19:41.681
Why don't you blow
the leaves into a pile

19:41.681 --> 19:43.616
and pick them the
fuck up and toss them?

19:43.650 --> 19:44.484
Why?
(tense music)

19:44.484 --> 19:45.318
Tell me why?

19:50.122 --> 19:52.492
- Sorry senora, I
have to finish work.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.365
- Look, I'm sorry I yelled.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.534
It's been a rough
several months for me

20:01.534 --> 20:03.636
and I think I'm starting
to lose it a bit.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.138
I apologize.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.008
You sure I can't just
give you some money

20:09.041 --> 20:10.577
and maybe you can finish early?

20:12.579 --> 20:14.914
- I can't do it, but
I finished fast, I go.

20:14.981 --> 20:19.986
Okay?

20:24.424 --> 20:27.327
(machine whirring)

20:29.562 --> 20:32.231
(ominous music)

20:48.281 --> 20:51.117
(Javier screaming)

20:57.390 --> 21:00.226
(machine whirring)

21:05.765 --> 21:08.301
- I feel like such
a giant douche bag.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.269
- I mean, yeah.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.072
- That's the last
thing that guy needed.

21:13.072 --> 21:16.075
Was some crazy girl yelling
at him for doing his job.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.611
I probably sound no better
than some racist asshole.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.747
Oh!

21:20.747 --> 21:23.049
- Oh, it's not that bad.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.984
Those things are super
loud and annoying.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.454
Especially when you're
tired with a headache.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.556
I'm sure you're not the first
person to say something.

21:29.589 --> 21:32.091
I can't tell you how many
times I wanted to myself.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.428
- It's just,

21:36.796 --> 21:37.764
then I...

21:42.435 --> 21:43.235
- What?

21:46.005 --> 21:47.840
- Nevermind, nothing.

21:47.840 --> 21:48.641
Not important.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.310
- [Roberta] You sure?

21:51.310 --> 21:52.912
- Yes.

21:52.912 --> 21:53.746
What's for dinner?

21:54.914 --> 21:58.818
- I was thinking
tacos then margaritas.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.286
- Wait, really?

22:00.319 --> 22:02.789
Or are you making
fun of me still?

22:02.789 --> 22:03.590
- A little bit of both.

22:03.590 --> 22:04.424
- Hey!

22:05.592 --> 22:06.926
- Wait, but you
like tacos, right?

22:06.959 --> 22:08.194
- Of course I like tacos.

22:08.194 --> 22:10.863
I just feel weird saying
like, "Yay tacos!"

22:10.930 --> 22:12.164
given what just happened.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.800
(Roberta chuckles)

22:13.833 --> 22:15.668
- It's actually more
ignorant for you

22:15.668 --> 22:17.837
to assume that he was Mexican.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.006
He could have been from El
Salvador for all you know.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.508
- Oh, geez, you're right.

22:21.541 --> 22:22.675
(Liz groans)

22:22.675 --> 22:25.678
- Come on, I'm totally kidding.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.550
- [Liz] Why do I suck so bad?

22:30.617 --> 22:32.218
- You don't.

22:32.218 --> 22:33.853
You actually suck good.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.457
- How would you know?

22:37.457 --> 22:38.791
- I can just imagine.

22:43.463 --> 22:44.330
- Thank you.

22:45.297 --> 22:46.666
Thank you for being awesome.

22:48.468 --> 22:49.736
- I honestly can't help it.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.173
- [Liz] Brody!

22:54.206 --> 22:56.075
- Hey, where are you going?

22:56.075 --> 22:57.644
- My dog is more humble than you

22:57.677 --> 22:59.245
and he's totally
full of himself.

23:03.182 --> 23:05.852
(ominous music)

23:09.522 --> 23:12.358
(heavy breathing)

23:18.330 --> 23:19.932
Why won't you leave me alone!

23:26.739 --> 23:28.841
I know you're out here
you son of a bitch.

23:32.244 --> 23:36.182
Where are you?

23:36.182 --> 23:38.918
(dramatic music)

23:40.853 --> 23:43.355
(Liz screams)

23:53.566 --> 23:55.735
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

23:55.768 --> 23:57.103
Wake up, wake up!

23:58.104 --> 24:00.540
(Liz screams)

24:06.646 --> 24:09.148
(Brody barks)

24:25.598 --> 24:28.267
(clock chiming)

24:51.591 --> 24:54.594
(suspenseful music)

25:17.850 --> 25:20.620
(walls rumbling)

25:35.034 --> 25:37.536
(door creaks)

25:43.409 --> 25:45.712
(Liz screams)

25:45.712 --> 25:48.547
(heavy breathing)

26:07.399 --> 26:09.902
(door creaks)

26:19.178 --> 26:20.012
Wow.

26:21.113 --> 26:22.949
Hold it together, Liz.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.351
Hold it together.

26:29.889 --> 26:32.558
(water running)

26:36.763 --> 26:39.298
(Liz chuckles)

26:43.535 --> 26:48.540
(dramatic music)
(glass shatters)

26:54.981 --> 26:56.215
- Hey, do you have any of that

26:56.248 --> 26:57.784
non-dairy vegan
coffee ice cream.

26:57.784 --> 26:58.885
I like in your fridge?

27:00.720 --> 27:02.421
You know that stuff that
you had that one time,

27:02.454 --> 27:05.557
the like only time you
ever made me dinner?

27:10.296 --> 27:11.130
Hello?

27:12.131 --> 27:15.601
Liz, what are you doing?

27:17.469 --> 27:19.338
Oh, hey Brody!

27:19.338 --> 27:21.140
What is up my guy?

27:21.140 --> 27:23.743
Oh yeah, I miss you too!

27:23.776 --> 27:24.944
You're so big.

27:27.313 --> 27:30.649
Liz, oh my God,
what is going on?

27:33.319 --> 27:35.454
I have no idea what's
going on over there,

27:35.487 --> 27:37.857
but you look ridiculous.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.692
This actually reminds
me of that one time

27:39.759 --> 27:41.427
that you snuck into my room

27:41.427 --> 27:44.163
and tried to jack my
scuba dive Barbie,

27:44.163 --> 27:47.099
and I totally caught you, but
you thought I didn't see you.

27:47.133 --> 27:51.838
So you like inch your
way through the door.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.439
And I was like, "Dude, why
are you jacking my settings?"

27:53.472 --> 27:56.342
And you're like, "I'm not
jacking your settings."

27:58.144 --> 28:01.647
Oh God, jacking my settings.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.150
What a stupid saying our
dad ingrained into us.

28:04.150 --> 28:07.453
I still say jacking
all the time.

28:08.721 --> 28:10.156
Okay Liz, enough.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.023
What is up?

28:15.494 --> 28:16.729
- You are dead.

28:22.368 --> 28:23.202
- Am I?

28:25.637 --> 28:28.640
(Payton laughing)

28:28.640 --> 28:30.509
I'm just messing
sis, of course I am.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.345
I'm dead as Daffy
in duck season.

28:33.345 --> 28:34.246
Or am I?

28:37.750 --> 28:41.253
- What, what are you
doing here, Payton?

28:41.253 --> 28:43.422
- Well I wanted to see you.

28:43.489 --> 28:46.525
I mean, you look like shit,
all that lack of sleep.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.726
- Thank you.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.561
- Hey, what are older
sisters for, huh?

28:51.697 --> 28:54.033
- I'm completely losing my mind.

28:54.066 --> 28:57.003
- This is true, but I do
have some good news for you.

28:57.003 --> 29:00.172
It turns out, I can help you.

29:00.206 --> 29:02.674
You just gotta
listen to me, okay?

29:02.674 --> 29:04.844
Come here, sit down.

29:04.844 --> 29:05.711
Let's have a Kiki.

29:25.531 --> 29:28.434
- [Liz] What's it
like to be dead?

29:28.434 --> 29:29.435
- Short answer,

29:30.402 --> 29:32.905
it sucks.

29:32.905 --> 29:35.074
It is so boring.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.476
And, there's this.

29:37.476 --> 29:40.379
(bone snaps)
(Payton grunts)

29:40.412 --> 29:42.281
This is supposed
be attached to me.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.653
Other than that
though, honestly,

29:47.719 --> 29:49.889
it's really not that
different from being alive.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.792
- I've completely lost my mind.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.661
- Most likely, yeah.

29:55.661 --> 29:57.329
But I have to tell you sis,

29:57.329 --> 30:00.166
this isn't going to
stop until you let go.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.000
- Let go?

30:02.634 --> 30:03.802
Of what?

30:03.836 --> 30:05.838
- Well you can start
with that chick.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.106
- Chick.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.407
You mean Roberta?

30:08.407 --> 30:12.011
- Mm-hm, yeah, she
is bad news bears.

30:12.011 --> 30:12.845
- Are you kidding?

30:12.845 --> 30:13.779
She's a godsend.

30:13.812 --> 30:14.646
- Whoa!

30:15.982 --> 30:17.449
No.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.986
Nope, cut that shit loose.

30:19.986 --> 30:20.819
- Okay.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.357
Let's say you're actually
here talking to me.

30:25.424 --> 30:26.658
- Let's.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.360
- And this isn't some
insane hallucination,

30:28.427 --> 30:30.329
which I'm pretty sure it is,

30:31.697 --> 30:33.499
what the hell are
you talking about?

30:40.272 --> 30:43.775
- Liz, I have something to say.

30:46.145 --> 30:46.979
I'm sorry.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.681
I'm sorry about Seth.

30:53.019 --> 30:57.023
I'm sorry I had
a thing with him.

30:57.056 --> 30:59.058
You knew didn't you?

30:59.058 --> 31:00.492
- I suspected.

31:00.526 --> 31:03.362
- [Payton] Then why
didn't you say something?

31:03.362 --> 31:05.164
- What was I supposed to say?

31:05.197 --> 31:06.832
- I don't know, anything!

31:06.832 --> 31:08.867
- Hey Payton, are you
banging my boyfriend?

31:08.867 --> 31:10.069
Something like that?

31:10.136 --> 31:11.904
- I didn't know, I
wanted to be wrong.

31:11.904 --> 31:13.372
I wanted it to go away.

31:16.408 --> 31:17.809
- Is that why you hesitated?

31:19.211 --> 31:20.479
- Huh?

31:20.512 --> 31:23.082
- That day on the water
I could have sworn

31:23.082 --> 31:25.184
you hesitated to pull
me into the boat.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.354
(tense music)

31:28.387 --> 31:29.555
- What?

31:29.555 --> 31:31.690
- It's okay sis, I get it.

31:31.690 --> 31:32.858
It was just a moment.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.226
- No, I would-

31:34.226 --> 31:36.062
- Just long enough
for it to get me.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.330
- Wait!

31:38.330 --> 31:39.098
I didn't!

31:41.100 --> 31:41.934
I didn't!

31:43.402 --> 31:44.203
I didn't!

31:49.041 --> 31:51.543
(Liz laughing)

31:55.047 --> 31:57.283
And then that was
it, she was gone.

31:57.283 --> 31:59.285
- Just, gone?

31:59.285 --> 32:00.086
- Yep.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.688
- Did you actually
see her vanish,

32:02.721 --> 32:05.557
or was she just
there then not there?

32:05.591 --> 32:06.758
- Do you mean if
I actually saw her

32:06.758 --> 32:08.427
disintegrate or something?

32:08.427 --> 32:09.695
- [Therapist] Well, whatever.

32:10.896 --> 32:14.600
- No, she was just
there, then not.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.469
- I always wondered about that.

32:17.469 --> 32:20.306
When people say that
they saw something

32:20.372 --> 32:21.773
vanish in front of their eyes.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.410
What that really looked like.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.777
It's never happened to me.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.280
- Okay.

32:29.781 --> 32:30.616
That's cool.

32:33.085 --> 32:35.754
- I didn't mean to distract
you with questions.

32:37.323 --> 32:38.224
Please continue.

32:39.125 --> 32:39.992
- [Liz] That's it.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.662
- What do you think she meant

32:43.729 --> 32:47.933
about Roberta being
"bad news bears"?

32:47.966 --> 32:48.967
- I have no idea.

32:49.901 --> 32:50.669
Zero.

32:52.171 --> 32:54.506
I would think she'd be happy
that there was someone there

32:54.506 --> 32:56.408
to comfort and take care of me.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.177
- Yeah.

32:58.177 --> 32:59.145
- Yeah, so I don't know.

32:59.145 --> 33:00.612
That's just all kinds of wrong.

33:02.081 --> 33:02.981
- [Therapist] Do
you wanna talk about

33:02.981 --> 33:04.950
what she said at the end?

33:04.983 --> 33:06.818
About the hesitation?

33:09.355 --> 33:11.923
- I don't think I hesitated.

33:11.957 --> 33:12.791
- Okay.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.995
- But I don't know.

33:18.797 --> 33:21.667
- Up til now your guilt
has been about being

33:21.667 --> 33:24.836
the only survivor, correct?

33:24.870 --> 33:25.704
- I guess.

33:27.473 --> 33:29.375
- [Therapist] Maybe
there's more to it.

33:31.777 --> 33:33.779
- You saying I did hesitate?

33:33.779 --> 33:34.613
- Not at all.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.850
But maybe you think you did?

33:40.186 --> 33:42.688
You said you told
Payton that you

33:42.688 --> 33:46.024
suspected something was
going on, but did you,

33:46.024 --> 33:47.459
or did you actually know?

33:49.195 --> 33:50.529
- I don't know, maybe.

33:51.697 --> 33:54.966
- Okay, we don't have
to talk about this.

33:56.202 --> 33:58.470
- I just wanna know
why Payton came to me.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.540
- Hallucinations have no logic.

34:03.509 --> 34:05.377
- Are you sure it
was a hallucination?

34:07.045 --> 34:09.548
(tense music)

34:14.386 --> 34:16.388
No, not today.

34:21.427 --> 34:22.828
- [Roberta] There you are.

34:22.861 --> 34:24.330
- Hi.

34:24.330 --> 34:26.165
- I was knocking out front.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.434
- Oh, sorry, I was
just back here.

34:30.102 --> 34:31.603
- Thinking about taking a swim?

34:31.603 --> 34:33.505
- No, not yet.

34:33.539 --> 34:34.506
- You sure?

34:34.506 --> 34:35.841
It could be fun.

34:35.874 --> 34:37.209
- I'm sure.

34:37.243 --> 34:38.210
Hey, you're early.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.878
Dinner's not ready yet.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.748
- Yeah, I got off
work on time for once.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.083
I was excited to see
what my girls made me.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.385
- Well don't get too excited.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.420
I basically know how
to make two things.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.921
Meatloaf and stir fry.

34:49.921 --> 34:50.956
- Ooh, yum.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.192
So, what we having?

34:53.225 --> 34:57.196
- I thought we'd have fish.
(slow paced music)

35:09.641 --> 35:10.476
- Mm, wow.

35:12.278 --> 35:13.111
Thank you, babe.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.280
That was really good.

35:14.313 --> 35:15.947
- Stop lying.

35:15.947 --> 35:16.915
- I'm not lying.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.150
- Yay!

35:18.150 --> 35:21.052
(Roberta chuckles)

35:26.892 --> 35:28.294
- How was your session today?

35:29.661 --> 35:30.662
- It was interesting.

35:32.464 --> 35:33.399
- [Roberta] How so?

35:35.801 --> 35:37.469
- I haven't really told you

35:37.469 --> 35:39.638
about that day
Payton and Seth died.

35:39.671 --> 35:40.472
Have I?

35:41.640 --> 35:42.641
- Not really.

35:44.142 --> 35:47.078
I just figured you weren't
ready to talk about the details.

35:48.113 --> 35:48.947
- I wasn't,

35:50.249 --> 35:51.250
but I am now.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.287
- Oh.

35:55.321 --> 35:56.422
Okay then.

35:56.422 --> 35:58.490
- But we need wine first.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.325
Lots of it.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.160
- [Roberta] I'm down for that.

36:04.796 --> 36:08.667
- Doctor said I was lucky I
didn't bleed out or lose my leg.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.102
- Fuck.

36:11.102 --> 36:12.604
- Peyton and Seth
weren't so lucky.

36:14.005 --> 36:14.840
- Wow.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.477
- Do you have any battle scars?

36:18.477 --> 36:20.612
- Um, well-

36:20.612 --> 36:22.113
- What am I saying,
of course you don't.

36:22.147 --> 36:23.482
You are perfect.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.217
- Far from it.

36:25.217 --> 36:28.620
Oh, look, check this out.

36:28.654 --> 36:30.155
- What am I looking at?

36:30.188 --> 36:32.524
- Bee sting, fourth grade.

36:32.524 --> 36:33.659
(both laugh)

36:33.692 --> 36:34.526
- Please.

36:35.394 --> 36:36.228
- I crack me up.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.063
- Oh, I know you do.

36:38.063 --> 36:39.398
- [Roberta] Cheers to that.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.311
- We were on our
scuba dive trip,

36:52.311 --> 36:53.579
I had just learned
and it was gonna

36:53.579 --> 36:55.881
be my first time
in the open ocean.

36:55.881 --> 36:58.684
I was nervous like
you wouldn't believe.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.552
The sea has always scared me.

37:00.552 --> 37:01.887
- Me too, I understand.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.256
- Yeah, the not knowing
what's under there.

37:04.323 --> 37:05.324
The power of it.

37:06.492 --> 37:08.059
You know, I was
always drawn to it.

37:10.161 --> 37:13.164
Anyway, so we're
there in the water.

37:13.164 --> 37:14.833
Our raft just a few meters away.

37:16.234 --> 37:19.571
I started to freak out
and swim back to the raft.

37:19.571 --> 37:20.906
I couldn't get
myself to dive under,

37:20.906 --> 37:22.508
even after all those lessons.

37:24.009 --> 37:25.344
I'm just about to climb in,

37:26.912 --> 37:28.380
Payton and Seth are of course

37:28.414 --> 37:30.416
yelling at me to come
back, but I didn't listen.

37:31.783 --> 37:33.852
At one point, I remember
turning around to face them

37:33.885 --> 37:35.554
one last time before going in,

37:37.088 --> 37:39.257
and there they were
looking so close.

37:41.126 --> 37:42.127
So intimate.

37:44.029 --> 37:46.565
I felt a shutter
of disappointment

37:48.700 --> 37:49.701
and disgust.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.105
I had suspected there was
something going on between them,

37:54.105 --> 37:56.608
but that's, that's when I knew.

37:56.608 --> 37:59.277
(tense music)

37:59.277 --> 38:02.247
I turned to get in and I
feel this pull on my leg.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.786
I can't explain
it, it jolted me.

38:10.456 --> 38:12.724
I reached down and feel
my leg has been torn.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.261
There's blood on my hand.

38:18.964 --> 38:22.300
I'm just about to scream when
there's this splashing sound

38:22.300 --> 38:25.437
and Seth is yelling "Shark,
get back to the raft."

38:25.471 --> 38:26.772
Payton, the screaming too.

38:29.140 --> 38:34.145
Seth is flailing in the
water, then whoosh, he's gone.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.316
Taken under.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.787
Just red water left behind.

38:45.657 --> 38:48.460
Payton is screaming,
"Get back to the raft."

38:48.460 --> 38:50.796
She starts swimming towards me.

38:50.796 --> 38:51.997
I don't know where I
found the strength,

38:51.997 --> 38:53.264
but I pull myself in.

38:54.766 --> 38:57.268
I look and see Peyton
swimming as fast as she can.

39:01.139 --> 39:03.709
I can see the shadow of
the shark behind her.

39:03.709 --> 39:04.943
It's not like in the movies

39:04.976 --> 39:07.145
where you see the
fin chasing her.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.013
No.

39:10.215 --> 39:11.450
It was deeper in the water,

39:11.483 --> 39:12.818
but from my view,
I could see it.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.487
I yell at her to hurry.

39:15.521 --> 39:17.789
She's almost to the
raft, she reaches for me,

39:17.789 --> 39:19.891
I reach for her and-

39:19.891 --> 39:20.726
- [Payton] Help!

39:20.726 --> 39:22.394
Help please!

39:22.461 --> 39:23.462
- She's taken under.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.033
Swift and silent, like nothing.

39:29.868 --> 39:33.539
I don't know if it
was one shark or many.

39:33.539 --> 39:36.708
I'm guessing many, because
that would make more sense.

39:41.179 --> 39:44.983
At this point, it's just
me alone in the raft,

39:46.885 --> 39:47.686
in shock

39:49.220 --> 39:50.055
and bleeding.

39:54.760 --> 39:55.561
- Wow.

39:56.562 --> 39:59.030
I have no idea what to say.

40:00.265 --> 40:02.434
I can't even imagine.

40:02.501 --> 40:06.872
- Yeah, luckily a yacht
came by to save me.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.107
I mean, that was damn lucky.

40:09.107 --> 40:10.876
- Someone was watching over you.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.211
- Oh, I don't believe
in that bullshit.

40:13.211 --> 40:14.012
- It's okay.

40:15.180 --> 40:16.047
You don't have to.

40:17.716 --> 40:18.917
- The thing is I think I,

40:24.389 --> 40:28.426
hesitated when I reached
to help Payton out.

40:32.030 --> 40:32.864
I think I,

40:36.602 --> 40:38.470
I think I wanted the
shark to get her.

40:39.471 --> 40:42.307
- No, that couldn't be true.

40:44.610 --> 40:45.777
- I don't know.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.782
I don't know.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.484
I don't know anymore.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.321
(melancholy music)

41:07.966 --> 41:10.602
- Hey, hey, I'm here.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.838
It's okay, I'm not
going anywhere.

41:17.643 --> 41:19.978
I don't think this
is the time to-

41:19.978 --> 41:21.479
- Just agree, I want to.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.313
- Liz-

41:22.313 --> 41:23.314
- No Roberta,

41:24.149 --> 41:25.450
I'm tired of being afraid.

41:26.785 --> 41:28.787
I wanna live.

41:28.787 --> 41:30.288
I wanna live my life.

41:34.259 --> 41:35.093
- Okay.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.669
- Oh I'm sorry, that's gross.

41:43.669 --> 41:46.337
- Don't apologize,
it's sexy snot.

41:46.371 --> 41:47.539
(Liz laughs)

41:47.539 --> 41:48.607
- No.

41:48.640 --> 41:49.941
Oh God, no.

41:52.477 --> 41:55.847
Let me at least get a
little bit presentable.

41:55.847 --> 41:56.882
I'll be right back.

41:56.948 --> 41:57.716
- Okay.

42:02.487 --> 42:05.156
(Roberta sighs)

42:06.224 --> 42:07.058
Fuck.

42:17.903 --> 42:20.371
(rushing winds)
(Liz screams)

42:20.371 --> 42:21.206
- Seth.

42:22.407 --> 42:24.242
- You're really gonna
sleep with that girl?

42:24.309 --> 42:26.244
- Oh my God, now you too?

42:26.244 --> 42:27.579
What do you want?

42:27.579 --> 42:30.548
- I came to keep you
from making a mistake.

42:30.548 --> 42:31.850
- What mistake?

42:31.883 --> 42:33.351
- Sleeping with that girl.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.722
I always knew you dug girls.

42:36.722 --> 42:39.190
You checked them out
more than I would.

42:39.190 --> 42:40.391
- Maybe that's because
you were too busy

42:40.391 --> 42:41.893
checking my sister out.

42:43.261 --> 42:44.095
- Touche.

42:47.532 --> 42:50.235
- I'm going to walk
out of this bathroom

42:50.235 --> 42:53.404
and you are going to disappear.

42:54.673 --> 42:56.675
- Afraid not, this
is too important.

42:58.043 --> 42:59.678
- What's too important?

42:59.678 --> 43:01.780
- You cutting this bitch loose.

43:04.082 --> 43:06.752
- No, I am not
taking this from you.

43:08.887 --> 43:11.389
(tense music)

43:31.542 --> 43:32.878
Oh my God, oh my God.

43:32.911 --> 43:34.946
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

43:36.882 --> 43:37.783
- It's okay.
- I don't know

43:37.783 --> 43:38.583
- [Liz] what's going on with me.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.786
- It's okay.

43:40.786 --> 43:42.087
Liz, it's okay.

43:42.087 --> 43:44.790
- I just wish they'd
leave me alone.

43:44.790 --> 43:46.557
Why won't they leave me alone?

43:48.459 --> 43:49.294
- Who?

43:52.297 --> 43:53.464
- Payton and Seth.

43:55.734 --> 43:56.567
- They were here?

44:02.640 --> 44:03.775
Well, they're gone now.

44:05.643 --> 44:06.477
I'm here.

44:09.314 --> 44:10.415
They're gone.

44:17.455 --> 44:22.460
(ominous music)
(heavy breathing)

44:48.286 --> 44:51.522
(Brody panting)

44:51.522 --> 44:52.357
- Berta?

45:12.210 --> 45:14.746
(pot bubbling)

45:19.985 --> 45:21.319
(tense dramatic music)

45:21.319 --> 45:23.054
- Good morning Sunshine.

45:23.054 --> 45:24.655
- Jesus Payton, what the hell?

45:24.689 --> 45:26.257
- So, did you hook
it up with that

45:26.257 --> 45:29.194
non-dairy vegan coffee,
ice cream yet or what?

45:29.227 --> 45:31.029
- What? No.

45:32.663 --> 45:35.834
- Dang sis, glad to see
how much you love me.

45:37.068 --> 45:40.571
Ooh, how about some
cinnamon Dolce latte?

45:40.571 --> 45:42.073
- I just have plain coffee.

45:42.073 --> 45:44.843
- Plain coffee, lame!

45:44.876 --> 45:47.178
Almost as lame as
matcha green tea.

45:48.079 --> 45:49.680
- Huh?

45:49.680 --> 45:50.515
- Nevermind.

45:51.716 --> 45:55.586
So I hear someone almost
got laid last night.

45:55.586 --> 45:57.555
- That's none of your business.

45:57.588 --> 46:00.591
- Well Seth already told
me all about it, so.

46:00.591 --> 46:01.626
- You guys talk?

46:01.626 --> 46:03.294
- Oh yeah, all the time.

46:05.630 --> 46:08.133
It's not like there's much
else to do around here.

46:09.134 --> 46:10.301
Are you sure you
don't have like,

46:10.368 --> 46:12.971
just something that
I can munch on?

46:12.971 --> 46:13.972
- Can you even eat?

46:13.972 --> 46:14.806
- Yeah.

46:16.041 --> 46:18.376
Well, no, but yeah.

46:23.781 --> 46:27.452
Ooh yes, that is what
I'm talking about.

46:28.619 --> 46:29.454
Come on.

46:31.222 --> 46:32.924
- Do you mind if I pour
myself some coffee?

46:32.958 --> 46:35.560
- Not at all, but do me a
favor and pass those over.

46:38.296 --> 46:39.130
Hey-o!

46:44.569 --> 46:47.939
(Payton groans)

46:47.973 --> 46:49.607
- You look like shit, Payton.

46:50.608 --> 46:51.609
- You stole my line.

46:52.743 --> 46:55.413
And yeah, yeah, I don't
look so hot, I know.

46:56.814 --> 46:59.817
God, remember how flawless
my skin was in life?

46:59.817 --> 47:01.086
- I do.

47:01.119 --> 47:02.954
I hated you for it.

47:02.954 --> 47:03.788
- Oh, I know.

47:03.821 --> 47:05.256
- My zits had zits,

47:05.256 --> 47:07.993
meanwhile, your skin was smooth
as shit from a duck's ass.

47:07.993 --> 47:09.160
(Payton laughs)

47:09.194 --> 47:11.462
- Nice, and accurate.

47:11.496 --> 47:14.099
- All the boys and
the girls actually

47:14.099 --> 47:17.335
wanted to touch my sister's
smooth, perfect skin.

47:17.335 --> 47:21.006
- Oh, stop hating sis.

47:21.006 --> 47:23.141
Plus, look at me now.

47:24.675 --> 47:27.045
- It's actually kind of
good to see you, Payton.

47:27.045 --> 47:29.214
Even if you look
like puked up sushi.

47:30.681 --> 47:32.283
- Thank you.

47:32.317 --> 47:34.152
- So, what's up?

47:37.188 --> 47:40.458
(Payton clears throat)

47:44.695 --> 47:47.198
- Ugh, plain black coffee.

47:47.198 --> 47:48.733
Ugh.

47:48.733 --> 47:49.901
- You want water?

47:49.968 --> 47:51.569
- No, I'm good.

47:51.569 --> 47:55.406
Now, you don't seem
to be getting it.

47:55.406 --> 47:56.908
- Sure, I do.

47:56.975 --> 47:58.709
You and Seth are undead,

47:58.709 --> 48:01.980
and I need to get rid of
Roberta for some reason.

48:02.880 --> 48:05.984
- Yeah, that's right.

48:05.984 --> 48:07.418
- Why?

48:07.418 --> 48:10.321
- [Payton] You just have
to, she's holding you back.

48:10.355 --> 48:11.256
- From what?

48:11.256 --> 48:14.259
- Liz, listen to me.

48:14.259 --> 48:17.762
If you don't, Seth and
I will never go away

48:17.762 --> 48:20.431
and you will be
cursed to see us rot.

48:20.431 --> 48:22.667
- I don't understand
any of this.

48:22.700 --> 48:25.570
- [Payton] You don't have to,
you just have to believe me.

48:27.772 --> 48:31.542
- So breaking up with
her will change that?

48:31.576 --> 48:33.211
- I didn't say
break up with her.

48:34.212 --> 48:36.214
I said, get rid of her.

48:36.247 --> 48:38.749
(ominous music)

48:38.749 --> 48:41.886
- Wait a minute, you don't mean-

48:41.919 --> 48:44.555
(ear splashes)

48:44.555 --> 48:45.390
- Shit.

48:46.924 --> 48:48.093
(Liz gags)

48:48.093 --> 48:48.926
Sorry.

48:50.528 --> 48:53.898
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.066
It's all good.

48:55.066 --> 48:56.767
No worries, okay.

48:56.767 --> 48:58.603
See, all good.

48:59.704 --> 49:00.871
(Liz gags)

49:00.905 --> 49:02.907
Oh, come on sis, stop
being so dramatic,

49:02.907 --> 49:04.075
it wasn't all that.

49:04.075 --> 49:06.311
(Liz gags)

49:13.784 --> 49:16.421
- That was truly the most
disgusting thing I've ever seen.

49:16.454 --> 49:17.989
- I admit, it was not tight.

49:19.624 --> 49:20.758
So are you good?

49:20.791 --> 49:22.627
(Liz gags)

49:22.627 --> 49:23.561
- I'm good.

49:25.963 --> 49:29.967
- So I take it you
don't want this coffee?

49:32.103 --> 49:32.937
Cool.

49:34.305 --> 49:38.343
(Payton clears throat)

49:38.409 --> 49:40.645
(Liz gags)

49:44.449 --> 49:47.252
All right sis, I gotta head,

49:48.686 --> 49:50.188
but remember what I said, okay.

49:50.255 --> 49:52.157
- I don't even
know what you said.

49:52.157 --> 49:53.324
- Yeah, you do.

49:53.358 --> 49:55.026
- I still don't understand why.

49:56.194 --> 49:58.429
- Get rid of her!
(dramatic music)

50:01.966 --> 50:04.335
(tense music)

50:04.335 --> 50:06.537
- [Therapist] Wow, that's
some intense stuff.

50:08.173 --> 50:09.107
- Yeah.

50:09.140 --> 50:10.175
- What do you think it means?

50:11.342 --> 50:13.778
- Isn't that what you
are supposed to tell me?

50:13.811 --> 50:15.213
- Not necessarily.

50:15.213 --> 50:18.849
- I love that answer
that's not an answer.

50:19.950 --> 50:21.119
- That's what we do.

50:22.487 --> 50:25.690
In all seriousness, I'm
supposed to help you

50:25.690 --> 50:29.227
decipher what it means,
not tell you what it means.

50:30.328 --> 50:32.830
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:32.830 --> 50:34.832
- I know that this is tough.

50:34.832 --> 50:37.168
I know that you want
definitive answers.

50:38.403 --> 50:40.538
Unfortunately, I can't
provide you with that,

50:41.572 --> 50:43.408
but can I offer a suggestion?

50:45.410 --> 50:49.013
I know that we discussed
swimming in the pool

50:50.648 --> 50:53.684
as a way to face your fear
of being an actual water,

50:53.718 --> 50:55.553
with Roberta there
to support you.

50:55.553 --> 50:56.487
- Yeah.

50:57.588 --> 50:59.157
I don't think-

50:59.190 --> 51:03.494
- I think that it would be a
first step to another level.

51:04.229 --> 51:04.829
Just something to try.

51:06.564 --> 51:07.998
- I'm not ready for that yet.

51:09.767 --> 51:11.102
- Will you consider it?

51:11.169 --> 51:14.172
- Yeah, I'll consider
it, but I won't do it.

51:15.573 --> 51:18.343
- Well then that's not really
considering it, is it Liz?

51:20.845 --> 51:22.513
- I don't give a
flying rat's ass.

51:22.513 --> 51:25.015
There's no way I'm ready
to get into a pool.

51:25.015 --> 51:27.685
Nuh-uh, no way, nope.

51:27.718 --> 51:29.254
- Come on Liz.

51:29.254 --> 51:31.522
Just put your feet in,
I'll hold your hands.

51:31.556 --> 51:32.757
- I'm good.

51:32.757 --> 51:34.559
This is as close to the
pool as I like to get.

51:34.592 --> 51:37.262
- Oh, come on, for me?

51:37.262 --> 51:39.764
- Don't try that, it
might actually work.

51:39.764 --> 51:41.266
- That's what I'm counting on!

51:45.403 --> 51:46.704
Yay!

51:46.704 --> 51:47.872
- Just give me a minute.

51:47.872 --> 51:49.106
Don't try anything!

51:49.106 --> 51:50.908
- I won't, I wouldn't dare.

51:50.941 --> 51:51.809
Take your time.

51:54.645 --> 51:56.547
Oh, you're doing so good baby!

51:56.581 --> 51:59.584
- Don't do that child,
baby encouraging talk.

51:59.617 --> 52:00.418
I'll just bail.

52:00.418 --> 52:02.086
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

52:02.119 --> 52:03.821
Me shush, shush.

52:07.958 --> 52:10.461
(tense music)

52:15.666 --> 52:19.003
(ominous music)

52:19.003 --> 52:19.837
What?

52:21.806 --> 52:23.241
(Liz screams)
(water splashing)

52:23.241 --> 52:24.809
- Don't let go!
(Roberta screams)

52:24.809 --> 52:25.643
Roberta!

52:29.146 --> 52:31.015
(ominous music)

52:31.081 --> 52:32.417
- You okay?

52:32.417 --> 52:33.251
Did you trip?

52:37.455 --> 52:38.456
- I can't.

52:40.291 --> 52:41.626
I can't.

52:41.626 --> 52:42.427
- God.

52:44.429 --> 52:46.030
- I can't, I'm sorry.

52:46.931 --> 52:48.499
- Oh, it's okay.

52:48.499 --> 52:49.767
It's okay.

52:49.800 --> 52:50.601
It's okay.

52:51.936 --> 52:52.703
It's okay.

52:55.440 --> 52:58.042
(ominous music)

53:18.028 --> 53:18.863
- Yes, I know.

53:19.830 --> 53:22.233
I can try more meditation maybe.

53:22.233 --> 53:24.469
- [Therapist] That doesn't
seem to be working for you.

53:25.870 --> 53:28.906
- Yeah, but I haven't been
putting all my focus onto it.

53:28.973 --> 53:29.907
I've been lazy.

53:31.075 --> 53:32.843
Also, I haven't been exercising.

53:35.380 --> 53:36.814
Let me try again.

53:36.814 --> 53:39.216
If there's no progress,

53:39.216 --> 53:43.020
if it gets worse, then
I'll take something, fair?

53:45.356 --> 53:46.324
- [Therapist] Fair.

53:53.564 --> 53:54.399
- Ohm.

53:56.100 --> 53:59.203
Oh my God, this is
never going to work.

53:59.236 --> 54:00.037
Ohm.

54:01.372 --> 54:03.207
- Payton, what do you want?

54:03.240 --> 54:04.675
Why are you doing this?

54:04.675 --> 54:07.678
- Told ya, you
gotta cut her loose.

54:07.678 --> 54:09.914
Gotta cut all this shit loose.

54:09.914 --> 54:11.716
Otherwise it's just
gonna get worse.

54:14.952 --> 54:17.788
(water splashing)

54:28.399 --> 54:31.068
(ominous music)

54:33.938 --> 54:35.540
- Want some fruit?

54:35.573 --> 54:36.574
It's really ripe.

54:38.108 --> 54:38.943
- No, thank you.

54:42.913 --> 54:45.483
- Hey, at work today,
Brendan was telling me

54:45.483 --> 54:48.653
this crazy gossip about
my coworker, Josh,

54:48.719 --> 54:50.220
who I was telling you about.

54:50.254 --> 54:53.424
The one who's always saying
inappropriate things.

54:53.458 --> 54:56.661
So apparently he tells
my boss that he thinks

54:56.661 --> 54:59.997
his manness is holding
him back at the office.

55:00.064 --> 55:02.433
(Roberta laughs)

55:02.467 --> 55:05.403
Like, isn't that hilarious?

55:05.403 --> 55:07.505
God, I just want that
guy to get a haircut.

55:08.406 --> 55:10.074
(Liz chuckles)

55:10.107 --> 55:11.008
You ready to eat?

55:15.480 --> 55:18.516
(dramatic music)

55:18.516 --> 55:21.586
Hey, I get it if
you don't like it,

55:21.619 --> 55:24.021
but you can be a
little nicer though.

55:25.990 --> 55:27.458
- I know, I'm sorry.

55:28.926 --> 55:32.930
It looks great, I'm just,
totally losing my mind.

55:34.331 --> 55:35.766
- Don't say that.

55:35.766 --> 55:36.767
No, you're not.

55:38.836 --> 55:40.004
- I really think I am.

55:44.041 --> 55:48.278
- Look, I believe you can
beat this and get better.

55:49.447 --> 55:53.017
But if you give up,
there's no hope.

55:53.017 --> 55:56.020
And I'm sorry to be blunt
like this, but it's true.

55:56.053 --> 55:57.488
There's no hope.

55:58.689 --> 56:00.725
I've lost family
to mental illness.

56:00.791 --> 56:02.460
I can recognize the signs.

56:03.528 --> 56:07.532
But Liz, I believe in you.

56:07.532 --> 56:09.534
I know you have what it takes

56:09.534 --> 56:11.201
to conquer this and get better.

56:12.369 --> 56:14.905
But that doesn't mean
jack if you don't.

56:17.408 --> 56:22.413
Now, do you believe it?
(slow paced music)

56:22.880 --> 56:23.481
Say it.

56:25.082 --> 56:25.916
- I believe it.

56:27.518 --> 56:28.686
- [Roberta] Believe what?

56:31.656 --> 56:33.323
- That I can conquer this thing.

56:40.598 --> 56:42.066
- You're God damn right you can.

56:43.734 --> 56:45.069
Now who's my tough bitch?

56:47.237 --> 56:49.206
- I'm your tough bitch.

56:49.239 --> 56:50.074
- Hell yeah.

56:53.177 --> 56:56.280
(Roberta sighs)

56:56.280 --> 56:57.181
Now eat your food.

57:04.354 --> 57:07.024
(ominous music)

57:32.950 --> 57:35.653
(dramatic music)

57:51.435 --> 57:52.970
- Why?

57:52.970 --> 57:55.573
- None of us can go
anywhere until you do it.

57:55.606 --> 57:56.774
It's just the way it is.

57:57.975 --> 58:00.310
- Why can't I just
break up with her?

58:00.310 --> 58:02.580
- Yeah, go ahead and
try, it's not gonna work.

58:03.914 --> 58:04.815
- So you'll let me?

58:06.150 --> 58:07.585
You'll let me try that first?

58:08.986 --> 58:11.288
If I can get rid of her that
way, then it will be okay?

58:15.993 --> 58:18.796
- Sure, you have tonight.

58:18.829 --> 58:21.265
- Otherwise we're
gonna do it for you.

58:21.265 --> 58:22.099
- Have fun.

58:23.834 --> 58:26.871
(tense solemn music)

58:29.807 --> 58:31.041
- It's okay, Brody.

58:32.843 --> 58:34.712
Your Mama's not
full-blown psycho yet.

58:37.848 --> 58:39.116
- I don't understand.

58:40.685 --> 58:42.319
- I just think
it's best for now.

58:43.453 --> 58:45.122
I'm not handling
all this super well,

58:45.122 --> 58:48.659
and it's not fair to you
to have to take care of me.

58:48.693 --> 58:50.895
- But I like taking care of you.

58:50.895 --> 58:52.663
- That's sweet, but I don't.

58:53.798 --> 58:56.466
I feel useless and weak.

58:56.500 --> 58:58.335
I need to prove to myself
that I can face this

58:58.368 --> 58:59.536
and get over this alone.

59:00.905 --> 59:02.907
- I can respect that,

59:02.907 --> 59:05.175
but I think it's
a terrible idea.

59:05.209 --> 59:06.143
- Of course you do.

59:07.544 --> 59:09.246
- [Roberta] What does that mean?

59:09.313 --> 59:11.015
- It means you want
to be the hero.

59:12.249 --> 59:13.651
You probably liked me so much

59:13.684 --> 59:16.353
because you love the
idea of saving me.

59:16.353 --> 59:18.022
- That's not true.

59:18.055 --> 59:19.156
- Like, hell it isn't.

59:20.557 --> 59:22.727
I'm willing to bet that when
I finally do feel better,

59:22.727 --> 59:23.894
you'll lose interest.

59:25.362 --> 59:27.231
You'll get bored and want
to move on to the next

59:27.231 --> 59:29.366
damsel in distress
that you can find.

59:29.399 --> 59:31.001
- [Roberta] Liz, please.

59:31.001 --> 59:32.502
That can't be further
from the truth.

59:32.536 --> 59:35.039
- Well, I don't need
or want a savior.

59:35.039 --> 59:37.174
I survived the attack.
I can survive this.

59:37.174 --> 59:38.909
- I know you can.

59:38.909 --> 59:39.877
I'm rooting for you.

59:39.910 --> 59:41.445
- Okay, great, so we agree.

59:41.445 --> 59:43.580
So know please, let
me have my space.

59:46.283 --> 59:47.852
- Liz, what's going on?

59:47.885 --> 59:49.053
- Oh, for the love of Christ.

59:49.053 --> 59:50.454
There goes that
therapist talk again.

59:50.454 --> 59:53.357
I already have one therapist,
I don't need another.

59:53.390 --> 59:55.559
- Don't do this.

59:55.592 --> 59:56.426
I love you.

1:00:02.566 --> 1:00:03.734
(tense solemn music)

1:00:03.734 --> 1:00:06.570
- Well, I don't love you.

1:00:08.238 --> 1:00:09.239
Now please get out.

1:00:11.909 --> 1:00:12.710
Get out!

1:00:23.287 --> 1:00:24.588
- I'm here if you need me,

1:00:25.823 --> 1:00:28.258
no matter what, I love you.

1:00:34.631 --> 1:00:37.134
(door creaks)

1:00:46.844 --> 1:00:48.779
- Hey, good job.

1:00:51.015 --> 1:00:52.082
Let's watch something.

1:00:53.317 --> 1:00:55.252
I hear "Six Headed Shark
Attack" is on Sci-Fi.

1:00:59.089 --> 1:01:02.426
- Payton, can you leave
me alone a moment?

1:01:02.426 --> 1:01:03.627
- Why?

1:01:03.660 --> 1:01:06.663
I wanna watch some bad
TV like we used to.

1:01:07.531 --> 1:01:08.699
Come on, please?

1:01:12.970 --> 1:01:14.604
(Payton groans)

1:01:14.604 --> 1:01:16.106
Fine.

1:01:16.106 --> 1:01:18.475
I'll leave you alone to mope.

1:01:18.508 --> 1:01:20.110
Adios Ms. Morose.

1:01:29.987 --> 1:01:32.656
(door knocking)

1:01:41.365 --> 1:01:42.900
- Who is it?

1:01:42.900 --> 1:01:45.002
- It's me, sorry.

1:01:45.035 --> 1:01:47.337
I think I left my
planner in the kitchen.

1:01:47.337 --> 1:01:49.039
I promise I'll just
grab it and go.

1:01:54.812 --> 1:01:56.180
I'm sorry, I don't
know what's going on,

1:01:56.213 --> 1:01:58.816
but I can't leave you
like this, I can't.

1:02:00.751 --> 1:02:01.919
- See, I told you.

1:02:01.986 --> 1:02:02.820
- I know.

1:02:03.921 --> 1:02:04.755
I know.

1:02:28.078 --> 1:02:30.747
(ominous music)

1:02:36.921 --> 1:02:39.623
(rustling water)

1:02:53.603 --> 1:02:56.240
(ominous music)

1:03:29.639 --> 1:03:31.108
- Payton?

1:03:31.108 --> 1:03:31.909
Seth?

1:03:33.177 --> 1:03:34.244
You guys out there?

1:03:37.481 --> 1:03:38.315
Payton?

1:03:39.516 --> 1:03:40.784
- See, we told you
it wouldn't work.

1:03:40.817 --> 1:03:42.019
- [Liz] Jesus Payton!

1:03:42.019 --> 1:03:43.753
- What, aren't you
used to this by now?

1:03:47.257 --> 1:03:49.159
- [Liz] What is it doing here?

1:03:49.159 --> 1:03:50.094
- Waiting for you.

1:04:04.641 --> 1:04:07.311
(ominous music)

1:04:22.659 --> 1:04:25.329
(rushing winds)

1:04:41.378 --> 1:04:44.048
(ominous music)

1:04:54.724 --> 1:04:57.694
This is the right
thing, the only thing.

1:04:57.727 --> 1:04:59.696
- [Seth] Stop the pain.

1:04:59.696 --> 1:05:01.198
- [Payton] You let me die, Liz.

1:05:05.535 --> 1:05:07.371
- You two carried
on behind my back.

1:05:08.772 --> 1:05:12.342
I never said a damn thing about
it because I was too scared.

1:05:12.376 --> 1:05:13.543
I'm not scared anymore.

1:05:15.579 --> 1:05:16.846
Maybe I did hesitate.

1:05:17.881 --> 1:05:18.715
Maybe I did.

1:05:20.184 --> 1:05:24.254
And maybe, just maybe, you
two both deserved to die.

1:05:28.192 --> 1:05:29.626
- Maybe we did.

1:05:29.626 --> 1:05:31.061
- Speak for yourself.

1:05:31.095 --> 1:05:32.562
- I have to ask one question.

1:05:34.931 --> 1:05:36.066
Didn't you feel bad?

1:05:37.767 --> 1:05:40.470
Wasn't the shame overwhelming
or did you just not care?

1:05:42.106 --> 1:05:44.708
- Well, that was more
than one question.

1:05:44.708 --> 1:05:45.875
- Payton.

1:05:45.875 --> 1:05:47.211
- What, that was
like three questions.

1:05:47.211 --> 1:05:48.812
- You're such a bitch.

1:05:48.812 --> 1:05:50.214
- Yeah, I can be.

1:05:50.247 --> 1:05:51.081
- No, you are.

1:05:51.081 --> 1:05:53.283
- Ew, who asked you?

1:05:53.283 --> 1:05:54.218
- Was it worth it?

1:05:58.288 --> 1:05:59.123
Tell me.

1:06:00.824 --> 1:06:02.292
- No, not really.

1:06:02.292 --> 1:06:03.627
- Yeah, I'd have to agree.

1:06:06.396 --> 1:06:08.398
- That's just fantastic.

1:06:11.801 --> 1:06:14.471
(ominous music)

1:07:06.723 --> 1:07:08.392
(suspenseful music)

1:07:08.458 --> 1:07:10.127
- Die, die, die die!

1:07:13.897 --> 1:07:15.665
Both of you just die!

1:07:20.304 --> 1:07:22.706
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:07:22.706 --> 1:07:25.409
I got you, I got you, I got you.

1:07:25.475 --> 1:07:26.810
Okay, it's over.

1:07:27.811 --> 1:07:29.346
It's over now.

1:07:29.379 --> 1:07:30.480
Oh it's over.

1:07:32.816 --> 1:07:33.650
It's over.

1:07:40.390 --> 1:07:41.225
There you go.

1:07:41.225 --> 1:07:42.058
- Thanks.

1:07:43.893 --> 1:07:45.562
- Is there anything
else you need?

1:07:46.663 --> 1:07:48.365
Do you want to go to the ER?

1:07:50.767 --> 1:07:52.068
- For what?

1:07:52.068 --> 1:07:53.570
For them to tell me I'm crazy?

1:07:55.038 --> 1:07:57.374
For stabbing my dead
sister and ex-boyfriend

1:07:58.375 --> 1:07:59.243
who weren't there?

1:08:01.911 --> 1:08:02.912
- I'm sorry, I just-

1:08:02.946 --> 1:08:04.881
- No, I'm sorry.

1:08:07.117 --> 1:08:09.419
Truthfully, I can't
believe you're still here.

1:08:10.587 --> 1:08:11.888
I can't believe you
didn't call the police

1:08:11.921 --> 1:08:13.257
and have them take me away.

1:08:14.090 --> 1:08:15.024
- I would never.

1:08:15.925 --> 1:08:17.261
I know you're not yourself.

1:08:19.729 --> 1:08:20.564
- I'm not.

1:08:24.868 --> 1:08:26.035
- Just promise you'll
let me take you

1:08:26.069 --> 1:08:27.237
to the doctor tomorrow.

1:08:29.072 --> 1:08:30.073
- I promise.

1:08:33.577 --> 1:08:36.980
My therapist is gonna have
a field day with this one.

1:08:36.980 --> 1:08:37.814
- It'll be fine.

1:08:41.285 --> 1:08:42.586
- Do you think I'm crazy?

1:08:45.822 --> 1:08:46.656
- [Roberta] No.

1:08:48.225 --> 1:08:50.059
I think you went through
something horrible

1:08:50.059 --> 1:08:51.661
and you're still
dealing with it.

1:08:53.330 --> 1:08:55.499
- Do you believe me
about Payton and Seth?

1:08:59.002 --> 1:09:01.238
- I believe you
loved them very much,

1:09:03.006 --> 1:09:05.475
and that you felt
betrayed by them.

1:09:07.010 --> 1:09:10.013
And I also believe that you
blame yourself for their deaths.

1:09:13.983 --> 1:09:16.486
- I'll ask my therapist
about medication tomorrow,

1:09:19.423 --> 1:09:22.125
but for now, do you
have any of your stuff?

1:09:24.127 --> 1:09:25.995
- Oh, really?

1:09:27.497 --> 1:09:28.332
- Yeah.

1:09:28.332 --> 1:09:29.433
I mean, at this point,

1:09:29.466 --> 1:09:31.000
anything to help me sleep.

1:09:32.168 --> 1:09:33.837
Anything to make
me feel different.

1:09:35.339 --> 1:09:36.172
- You sure?

1:09:37.341 --> 1:09:38.174
- I'm sure.

1:09:39.343 --> 1:09:40.143
- Okay.

1:09:43.780 --> 1:09:45.148
I'm gonna go get it.

1:09:45.181 --> 1:09:46.516
Get it now.

1:09:46.516 --> 1:09:47.351
- [Liz] Okay.

1:09:47.351 --> 1:09:48.218
- I'm going.

1:09:48.285 --> 1:09:49.018
- Okay.
- I'm leaving.

1:09:51.187 --> 1:09:52.856
- [Liz] What do I do, just-

1:09:52.889 --> 1:09:54.391
- You ever smoked a cigarette?

1:09:55.492 --> 1:09:57.193
- In high school, it was gross.

1:09:57.193 --> 1:09:59.162
- Okay, similar idea.

1:09:59.195 --> 1:10:01.365
You inhale, but with
this you inhale deeper

1:10:01.365 --> 1:10:03.467
and you hold it a few
seconds before you exhale.

1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:05.335
- Ugh, don't you have a vape?

1:10:05.369 --> 1:10:07.070
Isn't that what
everyone does nowadays?

1:10:07.070 --> 1:10:10.340
- Yeah, but I left it at home
and vaping's for bitches.

1:10:10.374 --> 1:10:11.207
Okay.

1:10:11.207 --> 1:10:12.175
This is old school.

1:10:13.076 --> 1:10:14.578
You ready?

1:10:14.578 --> 1:10:16.045
Okay.

1:10:16.045 --> 1:10:19.082
(slow distant music)

1:10:32.696 --> 1:10:35.932
(Liz coughing)

1:10:35.932 --> 1:10:37.100
You all right?

1:10:38.034 --> 1:10:38.868
- Oh, it's awful.

1:10:38.868 --> 1:10:40.337
I don't want anymore.

1:10:40.337 --> 1:10:41.871
- Okay, all right, hold on.

1:10:50.947 --> 1:10:51.748
Now hold it.

1:10:53.750 --> 1:10:54.551
Now exhale.

1:11:01.124 --> 1:11:02.426
- That was fine,
let's do that again.

1:11:02.426 --> 1:11:03.259
- Okay.

1:11:16.540 --> 1:11:18.575
(Roberta laughs)

1:11:18.608 --> 1:11:21.277
(both laughing)

1:11:22.946 --> 1:11:25.482
(upbeat music)

1:11:26.416 --> 1:11:27.250
- Again.

1:11:29.819 --> 1:11:32.322
* Tonight's the night

1:11:32.389 --> 1:11:36.893
* I don't know what to do

1:11:36.926 --> 1:11:39.329
* My heart is beating

1:11:39.329 --> 1:11:42.832
* I want you

1:11:42.899 --> 1:11:46.836
* And your moves
got me sweating *

1:11:46.836 --> 1:11:50.173
* I'm feeling so alive

1:11:50.173 --> 1:11:53.743
* Don't want the night to end

1:11:53.777 --> 1:11:58.515
* Everything you do is right

1:11:58.515 --> 1:12:01.485
* Just want your loving

1:12:01.485 --> 1:12:05.154
* To love you
through the night *

1:12:05.188 --> 1:12:08.525
* I just want your loving

1:12:08.525 --> 1:12:12.362
* Everything will be all right

1:12:12.362 --> 1:12:15.865
* Just want your loving

1:12:15.932 --> 1:12:19.769
* Love you through the night

1:12:19.769 --> 1:12:22.839
* Just want your loving

1:12:22.839 --> 1:12:25.041
* You and me

1:12:25.108 --> 1:12:28.645
* Together, we can be

1:12:28.678 --> 1:12:30.447
* Each others

1:12:30.447 --> 1:12:35.452
* Everything

1:12:36.553 --> 1:12:39.389
* Your everything

1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:53.336
* I just want your loving

1:12:53.369 --> 1:12:57.206
* To love you
through the night *

1:12:57.206 --> 1:12:58.708
* I just want your

1:12:58.708 --> 1:13:01.377
(women giggling)

1:13:04.213 --> 1:13:05.715
- All right, okay.

1:13:07.050 --> 1:13:07.884
All right.

1:13:08.885 --> 1:13:11.488
(both moaning)

1:13:21.565 --> 1:13:24.067
(Liz snoring)

1:13:26.503 --> 1:13:28.004
Sleep well my princess.

1:13:37.213 --> 1:13:40.116
(Roberta chuckles)

1:13:46.255 --> 1:13:49.025
(birds chirping)

1:14:03.439 --> 1:14:05.809
- Morning Brody, how are you?

1:14:09.078 --> 1:14:09.913
Berta?

1:14:11.147 --> 1:14:11.981
You here?

1:14:14.618 --> 1:14:15.451
Berta?

1:14:21.891 --> 1:14:22.826
Oh my God!

1:14:22.826 --> 1:14:24.628
- Hey, sorry.

1:14:24.628 --> 1:14:26.596
- [Liz] That's okay.

1:14:26.630 --> 1:14:27.597
- You're awake.

1:14:28.965 --> 1:14:30.900
Starting to get worried.

1:14:30.900 --> 1:14:32.168
- How long was I asleep?

1:14:33.737 --> 1:14:35.572
- About 28 hours.

1:14:35.605 --> 1:14:36.640
- What?

1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:37.841
- Yeah.

1:14:37.907 --> 1:14:40.309
- Oh my God, did you
think I was dead?

1:14:40.309 --> 1:14:41.978
- No silly,

1:14:41.978 --> 1:14:43.913
but I thought if he didn't
wake up this morning,

1:14:43.947 --> 1:14:45.782
then maybe I call the doctor.

1:14:45.815 --> 1:14:46.916
- Maybe?

1:14:46.916 --> 1:14:48.117
- Yeah.

1:14:48.151 --> 1:14:50.319
You've been sleep
deprived for a year.

1:14:50.319 --> 1:14:51.921
You needed it.

1:14:51.921 --> 1:14:53.857
Did you sleep well?

1:14:57.260 --> 1:14:58.628
- I guess I did.

1:14:59.529 --> 1:15:01.130
I didn't have a single dream.

1:15:02.131 --> 1:15:03.600
At least I don't remember.

1:15:05.034 --> 1:15:06.335
Wow!

1:15:06.335 --> 1:15:07.170
- Yay!

1:15:08.037 --> 1:15:09.639
Oh, I'm so happy for you, babe!

1:15:12.208 --> 1:15:14.110
- I'm happy for me too.

1:15:14.143 --> 1:15:16.512
And I feel great.

1:15:16.512 --> 1:15:18.047
- I'm glad to hear it.

1:15:18.114 --> 1:15:19.616
- Yay!

1:15:19.616 --> 1:15:21.450
Hooray for whatever it is
you gave me that night.

1:15:21.450 --> 1:15:22.952
- Hooray for weed.

1:15:22.952 --> 1:15:25.121
- Yes, do people know it
has medicinal purposes?

1:15:25.154 --> 1:15:27.657
(both laughing)

1:15:27.657 --> 1:15:29.793
I'm famished, what's for b-fast?

1:15:29.793 --> 1:15:31.961
- Haven't made
anything to eat, yet.

1:15:33.529 --> 1:15:37.300
- Well then, maybe I'll
just start with you.

1:15:38.401 --> 1:15:39.368
- Whoa, babe.

1:15:40.837 --> 1:15:42.338
Wait, for real?

1:15:43.206 --> 1:15:44.373
- [Liz] Mm-hm.

1:15:45.575 --> 1:15:47.010
- [Roberta] Well, okay, shit.

1:15:52.816 --> 1:15:55.685
(slow paced music)

1:15:57.053 --> 1:15:59.656
(Liz giggling)

1:16:06.562 --> 1:16:10.366
- I'm so sorry I made
you wait that long.

1:16:10.366 --> 1:16:12.869
That's probably the dumbest
thing I've ever done.

1:16:14.503 --> 1:16:17.874
- Do not apologize.

1:16:17.907 --> 1:16:19.909
That was worth the wait.

1:16:19.909 --> 1:16:21.410
- It sure was.

1:16:21.444 --> 1:16:22.846
Holy shit.

1:16:22.879 --> 1:16:25.882
(both women giggle)

1:16:27.250 --> 1:16:28.251
So seriously,

1:16:29.853 --> 1:16:31.688
I need some breakfast now.

1:16:31.688 --> 1:16:33.690
- Yeah, I'm hungry too.

1:16:35.424 --> 1:16:37.894
Let's go to the
kitchen shall we?.

1:16:37.927 --> 1:16:40.096
- Yes, let's,

1:16:42.098 --> 1:16:42.932
but first.

1:16:51.975 --> 1:16:53.877
Okay, now let's go.

1:16:53.910 --> 1:16:54.744
- Okay.

1:16:57.781 --> 1:16:59.282
- Roberta.

1:16:59.282 --> 1:17:00.116
- Yeah.

1:17:02.051 --> 1:17:03.252
- I can't move.

1:17:05.454 --> 1:17:07.590
- Neither can I.

1:17:07.623 --> 1:17:10.794
(both women laughing)

1:17:15.832 --> 1:17:18.768
(slow paced music)

1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:06.816
- [Therapist] So how
long has it been?

1:18:06.850 --> 1:18:08.952
- Two weeks, no nightmare.

1:18:08.952 --> 1:18:10.820
- That's incredible.

1:18:10.854 --> 1:18:11.888
Dreams of any kind?

1:18:13.056 --> 1:18:14.958
- I don't know,
I don't think so.

1:18:14.991 --> 1:18:16.993
If so, I don't
remember any of them,

1:18:16.993 --> 1:18:18.728
but I've been sleeping soundly

1:18:18.728 --> 1:18:21.630
and waking up feeling
like a million bucks.

1:18:21.664 --> 1:18:22.966
- Fantastic.

1:18:22.966 --> 1:18:24.700
The cannabis still helping?

1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:27.036
- [Liz] Actually, I haven't
used it in about a week now.

1:18:27.036 --> 1:18:28.137
- Hey.

1:18:28.171 --> 1:18:29.806
- And I've been meditating

1:18:29.806 --> 1:18:32.809
and swimming in
the pool every day.

1:18:32.842 --> 1:18:33.676
- No kidding.

1:18:33.676 --> 1:18:34.911
- No kidding.

1:18:34.911 --> 1:18:36.913
I think the exercise is
what's helping me sleep.

1:18:37.981 --> 1:18:39.482
- Wow.

1:18:39.482 --> 1:18:42.318
Just, wow.

1:18:42.318 --> 1:18:43.753
I am so happy for you.

1:18:43.753 --> 1:18:46.089
- Me too, I feel
like a person again.

1:18:47.423 --> 1:18:48.892
- And you and Roberta are-

1:18:48.892 --> 1:18:50.226
- We're doing really great.

1:18:50.259 --> 1:18:51.727
I'm up for more activities now,

1:18:51.727 --> 1:18:54.163
so we've been doing
so many fun things.

1:18:54.197 --> 1:18:56.332
We're actually planning a
trip to the Caicos Islands

1:18:56.332 --> 1:18:57.500
in a couple of months.

1:18:57.500 --> 1:18:59.168
- Caicos, where's that?

1:18:59.202 --> 1:19:00.503
- It's in the Caribbean.

1:19:00.503 --> 1:19:01.938
Roberta has some
friends up there

1:19:01.938 --> 1:19:05.408
that are actually gonna take
us diving with humpback whales.

1:19:05.408 --> 1:19:06.542
- You're going diving?

1:19:07.543 --> 1:19:08.377
In the ocean?

1:19:08.411 --> 1:19:09.245
- Yes.

1:19:09.245 --> 1:19:10.446
- Oh my God!

1:19:10.446 --> 1:19:12.015
- I know, I know,
I told Roberta that

1:19:12.048 --> 1:19:14.717
if I freak out last minute,
she can't pressure me.

1:19:14.750 --> 1:19:18.221
- Of course, but
that's so exciting.

1:19:18.221 --> 1:19:20.289
What brought this idea on?

1:19:20.289 --> 1:19:23.126
- Well, before the incident,
I had always wanted to dive,

1:19:23.126 --> 1:19:24.693
especially with whales.

1:19:24.727 --> 1:19:26.729
So when Roberta told
me about her friends,

1:19:26.762 --> 1:19:29.933
I thought, why not,
might as well try, right?

1:19:31.234 --> 1:19:32.601
- Right.

1:19:32.601 --> 1:19:36.039
Oh, that's wonderful Liz.

1:19:36.072 --> 1:19:37.140
- This thank you.

1:19:37.140 --> 1:19:39.208
And I really appreciate
all your help.

1:19:41.077 --> 1:19:41.911
- You're welcome.

1:19:44.213 --> 1:19:46.950
So do you think you'll be
able to go back to work soon?

1:19:48.117 --> 1:19:50.119
- Yeah, I guess so.

1:19:51.287 --> 1:19:52.555
Huh?

1:19:52.555 --> 1:19:55.158
Funny, I can't remember
the last time I worked,

1:19:56.259 --> 1:19:57.593
or what that job was.

1:19:58.794 --> 1:19:59.628
- Really?

1:20:01.597 --> 1:20:03.632
- No, I'm kidding.

1:20:03.632 --> 1:20:05.768
It's just been a while.

1:20:09.906 --> 1:20:11.740
- So, next week?

1:20:11.740 --> 1:20:12.575
- Yeah.

1:20:17.413 --> 1:20:20.749
(slow gentle music)

1:20:20.749 --> 1:20:23.486
(birds chirping)

1:20:30.159 --> 1:20:32.661
(floor thuds)

1:20:50.213 --> 1:20:51.014
Payton?

1:20:53.983 --> 1:20:54.717
Seth?

1:20:58.521 --> 1:21:01.190
(walls rumbling)

1:21:06.495 --> 1:21:08.231
(Liz sighs)

1:21:08.231 --> 1:21:11.234
Brody, you scared me.

1:21:11.234 --> 1:21:13.903
(clock chiming)

1:21:23.012 --> 1:21:25.681
Okay Brody, time for
a meditation break.

1:21:27.016 --> 1:21:27.850
Join me?

1:21:29.885 --> 1:21:32.388
Okay, fine, you do you.

1:21:33.722 --> 1:21:36.425
(doorbell rings)

1:21:37.393 --> 1:21:38.394
Who is it?

1:21:38.427 --> 1:21:39.528
- [Pizza Man] Pizza man.

1:21:39.562 --> 1:21:40.496
- Pizza?

1:21:40.496 --> 1:21:42.498
I didn't order any pizza.

1:21:42.531 --> 1:21:43.866
- [Pizza Man] It says
your name, ma'am.

1:21:43.866 --> 1:21:44.833
- What's the name?

1:21:46.602 --> 1:21:48.204
I said what's the name?

1:21:50.339 --> 1:21:52.241
- [Pizza Man] It says
this address ma'am.

1:21:52.241 --> 1:21:53.409
- [Liz] What's the name?

1:21:54.710 --> 1:21:56.045
- [Pizza Man] Excuse me?

1:21:56.079 --> 1:21:58.247
- What's the name on the order?

1:21:58.247 --> 1:21:59.515
- [Pizza Man] Having a
hard time hearing you.

1:21:59.515 --> 1:22:02.685
It's one pizza,
extra ham, ma'am.

1:22:02.685 --> 1:22:04.053
- Okay, but what's the name?

1:22:09.358 --> 1:22:11.027
I think you have
the wrong house.

1:22:12.261 --> 1:22:13.462
- [Pizza Man] Ma'am?

1:22:13.529 --> 1:22:15.931
- Oh my God, I said you
have the wrong house!

1:22:15.931 --> 1:22:18.901
(dramatic music)

1:22:18.934 --> 1:22:21.437
(Payton growls)

1:22:21.437 --> 1:22:24.273
(machine beeping)

1:22:28.311 --> 1:22:30.479
- I think we've done
all we can do here.

1:22:30.479 --> 1:22:31.580
Call it.

1:22:31.614 --> 1:22:34.283
- Time of death, 11:52 PM.

1:22:34.283 --> 1:22:37.486
Cause of death, blood
loss due to shark bite.

1:22:37.553 --> 1:22:39.488
- Nurse Quan, make
any arrangements.

1:22:39.488 --> 1:22:40.489
- [Quan] Yes Doctor.

1:22:42.558 --> 1:22:44.393
- She put up a hell
of a fight though.

1:22:44.393 --> 1:22:45.761
- Yeah, she sure did.

1:22:50.466 --> 1:22:53.136
(Roberta sighs)

1:22:58.974 --> 1:23:01.844
(slow gentle music)

1:23:13.522 --> 1:23:17.693
* My love

1:23:17.693 --> 1:23:21.430
* Isn't whole

1:23:21.464 --> 1:23:26.469
* With you

1:23:29.205 --> 1:23:34.043
* Sweeping in the sea

1:23:34.043 --> 1:23:39.048
* Where I wanna be

1:23:40.015 --> 1:23:44.453
* You and me

1:23:44.487 --> 1:23:46.655
* My love

1:23:49.325 --> 1:23:52.195
(fast tense music)

1:23:54.397 --> 1:23:57.066
(ominous music)

1:24:00.703 --> 1:24:04.073
(dramatic ominous music)

1:24:36.004 --> 1:24:39.007
(suspenseful music)

1:25:00.363 --> 1:25:02.965
(ominous music)
