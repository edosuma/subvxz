WEBVTT

00:00.887 --> 00:02.545
In the criminal
justice system...

00:02.647 --> 00:06.062
sexually-based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.264 --> 00:08.337
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.408 --> 00:10.164
who investigate
these vicious felonies...

00:10.296 --> 00:13.614
are members of an elite squad
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.689 --> 00:15.380
These are their stories.

00:20.442 --> 00:23.125
I'm Winfield, Citizen Watch. I
was on patrol. Got here first.

00:23.194 --> 00:24.854
You see anything?
Just the body.

00:24.923 --> 00:26.647
Thomas Marchek, pedophile.

00:26.714 --> 00:29.203
You say Marchek?
Yeah.

00:29.275 --> 00:30.551
You know the guy?

00:30.619 --> 00:32.180
He raped a
seven-year-old girl.

00:32.252 --> 00:34.140
Left her cut up and
unconscious in a drainpipe.

00:34.204 --> 00:35.481
Yeah, I know.

00:35.548 --> 00:37.556
And how are you so tuned in?

00:37.885 --> 00:39.445
I'm just doing my job.

00:39.613 --> 00:42.002
All right. Sir, did you
touch the body? I know better.

00:42.077 --> 00:43.735
Not even to check for vitals?

00:43.806 --> 00:46.227
Shorteye's head was
practically blown off.

00:46.301 --> 00:49.335
Look, if you want to talk to me,
here's a card with my numbers...

00:49.534 --> 00:50.713
home and work.

00:51.774 --> 00:53.018
It's nice to meet you.

00:55.711 --> 00:57.816
Five years ago,
I put this guy away.

00:58.752 --> 00:59.733
You SVU?

00:59.807 --> 01:01.717
Yeah, Benson, Stabler.
Who called us?

01:01.792 --> 01:04.126
You got three shots,
point blank to the face.

01:04.191 --> 01:05.206
Nine mil.

01:05.632 --> 01:08.502
Wouldn't be surprised if the
slugs turn out to be hollow point.

01:08.577 --> 01:09.787
Made quite a statement.

01:09.856 --> 01:11.231
And a mess.

01:11.297 --> 01:13.719
Now, why'd you call us in?
This is a homicide.

01:13.792 --> 01:15.932
Chief of Detective
reassigned by request.

01:16.002 --> 01:18.206
You sent the guy up. I guess
that's why you're catching.

01:18.275 --> 01:19.801
This is a dead ex-con.

01:19.874 --> 01:22.013
This is not a victim
of a sex crime. Was he raped?

01:22.082 --> 01:23.970
Do his wounds suggest
anything sexual in nature?

01:24.035 --> 01:26.817
I feel for you, pal,
but this comes from above.

01:27.171 --> 01:28.448
Your problem's not with me.

01:28.515 --> 01:29.825
Who made the request?

01:30.052 --> 01:32.059
A Captain Cragen.

01:35.684 --> 01:38.335
Elliot, give him a chance
to explain.

01:43.621 --> 01:44.669
Why?

01:45.733 --> 01:46.716
Excuse me?

01:46.789 --> 01:48.416
Thomas Marchek kidnapped
Corrine Branson...

01:48.486 --> 01:50.690
tortured her at knifepoint,
and left her for dead.

01:50.759 --> 01:51.741
I read the file.

01:51.814 --> 01:53.375
I was ready to cap
that dirtbag myself.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.040
Now you expect me to
work his homicide?

01:55.112 --> 01:56.999
One Police Plaza does.

01:57.063 --> 01:59.005
They asked me to take it,
I said "yes".

02:01.800 --> 02:03.555
To polish your
political apple?

02:04.009 --> 02:06.529
It's delicate territory and
you're familiar with the players.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.422
I'll fill Homicide in.
You go talk to the parents.

02:08.489 --> 02:11.009
I'll talk to the parents and tell
them the good news about Marchek.

02:11.082 --> 02:12.772
But I am not telling them
that they're suspects.

02:12.841 --> 02:15.111
According to the Chief, the
girl's mother threatened Marchek...

02:15.179 --> 02:16.193
at the last parole hearing.

02:16.265 --> 02:17.892
She should've threatened
the Parole Board...

02:17.963 --> 02:19.207
Are you finished?

02:25.900 --> 02:26.980
I don't want this case.

02:27.052 --> 02:30.313
I'm through explaining myself to
you. You caught it, you make it.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:21.267 --> 03:24.202
I begged the Parole Board
to keep him in prison...

03:24.275 --> 03:25.551
but they wouldn't listen.

03:25.620 --> 03:29.264
Lindsay, why didn't you call me? You
know I would have testified for you.

03:29.332 --> 03:31.187
I thought it was
just a formality.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.838
I never dreamed they
would actually let him out.

03:34.036 --> 03:36.241
We don't want to cause you
any more heartache.

03:36.309 --> 03:38.765
But I have to ask you.
I'm a suspect.

03:38.837 --> 03:40.692
You threatened to kill him.

03:41.270 --> 03:42.579
I was angry.

03:42.773 --> 03:44.978
Can you blame me?
No.

03:47.479 --> 03:49.137
Where were you last night?

03:50.391 --> 03:54.189
Right here with my child. I
won't let her out of my sight.

03:54.264 --> 03:55.693
And your husband?

03:56.440 --> 03:57.901
We're divorced.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.920
Where does he live now?

04:00.729 --> 04:02.551
I don't believe you people.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.559
Haven't we been
through enough?

04:07.770 --> 04:10.006
Hi Corrine. It's me, Elliot.

04:10.521 --> 04:11.699
Do you remember?

04:14.010 --> 04:17.807
I almost didn't recognize you. It's
been so long. You've grown a lot.

04:20.634 --> 04:22.041
How've you been?

04:24.284 --> 04:25.877
I remember you.

04:26.492 --> 04:27.920
You caught that man.

04:29.532 --> 04:30.612
Yes.

04:31.869 --> 04:33.046
Thank you.

04:35.581 --> 04:38.003
You never have to
thank me for that.

04:41.918 --> 04:43.707
Why aren't you at school?

04:44.382 --> 04:47.383
I have school here.
My mom teaches me.

04:48.352 --> 04:49.366
Why?

04:50.143 --> 04:52.445
I don't like it when
people look at me.

04:53.343 --> 04:54.587
I'm ugly.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.327
That's not true.

05:01.313 --> 05:02.621
Yes it is.

05:11.362 --> 05:13.053
It's a shame about Marchek.

05:13.123 --> 05:15.261
He was a good driver. He
never tried to skip his shift.

05:15.330 --> 05:17.470
You know him well?
Not to speak of.

05:17.539 --> 05:19.066
We drove together
a couple of times.

05:19.139 --> 05:21.921
What'd you talk about?
Usual stuff.

05:21.987 --> 05:24.256
Women troubles, sports...

05:24.324 --> 05:26.266
how the union ain't
what it used to be.

05:26.596 --> 05:28.222
Marchek had problems
with women?

05:28.293 --> 05:30.813
Yeah, some ex of his
was stalking him.

05:31.045 --> 05:32.769
He said he had a bad break-up.

05:32.837 --> 05:35.171
He was with a new one and
the old one couldn't let go.

05:35.238 --> 05:38.053
You ever see his former lady?
Yeah, hanging around once or twice.

05:38.118 --> 05:40.933
Man, I told him to call the cops,
but he said it wasn't worth it.

05:40.998 --> 05:42.973
Would you recognize her
if you saw her again?

05:43.110 --> 05:45.631
Blonde, little over 5'.

05:46.343 --> 05:47.652
Drove a light blue Honda.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.818
She's kind of old for him, though.
Maybe that's why he couldn't shake her.

05:50.888 --> 05:52.928
Did he mention a more
recent girlfriend?

05:53.000 --> 05:56.099
Yeah, Gloria something.

05:56.168 --> 05:57.249
Check with the office.

05:57.321 --> 06:00.354
Marchek said he didn't have family,
so she's probably his emergency notify.

06:00.424 --> 06:01.570
Thanks.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.264
Gloria, how long were you
and Thomas Marchek dating?

06:04.329 --> 06:05.758
About four months.

06:05.929 --> 06:08.995
We were already talking
about marriage, kids.

06:09.098 --> 06:10.113
Can't this wait?

06:10.186 --> 06:11.909
When was the last time
you saw him?

06:12.554 --> 06:14.016
Night before last.

06:14.091 --> 06:16.327
What about last night?
I was working.

06:16.395 --> 06:19.297
Where? Club Devinyl on 34th Street.

06:19.370 --> 06:20.778
I get off around 3:00.

06:20.843 --> 06:23.145
Tommy had left for work
by the time I got home.

06:23.371 --> 06:25.379
He ever talk about
his ex-girlfriend?

06:26.733 --> 06:28.260
I didn't know he had one.

06:28.333 --> 06:31.268
He mention anyone following him?
Maybe giving him a hard time?

06:31.342 --> 06:34.725
Yeah, there was this one guy.
Said he was with the Citizen Watch.

06:34.797 --> 06:36.652
Put up flyers with Tommy's
picture on it.

06:36.717 --> 06:38.922
He even followed us into
a restaurant and harassed us.

06:38.989 --> 06:41.860
And you are? Louise Durning.
I am a friend of Gloria's

06:41.935 --> 06:44.521
And I have witnessed the abuse
they've had to endure.

06:44.590 --> 06:45.540
What kind of abuse?

06:45.615 --> 06:48.463
He called Tommy names and called
me worse for being with him.

06:48.527 --> 06:51.047
They couldn't go out without
being assaulted by this man...

06:51.151 --> 06:53.127
or one of his storm troopers.

06:53.265 --> 06:55.632
Nobody saw the good
in Tommy but me.

06:55.697 --> 06:57.485
You know what he did?

06:58.578 --> 06:59.592
He changed.

06:59.664 --> 07:01.291
It didn't bother you?

07:02.258 --> 07:03.370
I loved him.

07:03.889 --> 07:07.665
Can't you see she's in enough pain?
Where's your compassion, for God's sake?

07:07.793 --> 07:10.511
With the little girl Tommy
raped and cut.

07:19.923 --> 07:21.167
You got to be kidding.

07:21.236 --> 07:24.978
Mr. Branson, just answer the
question. I was in Chicago on business.

07:25.044 --> 07:27.663
You want the receipts? I can prove
it. No, that won't be necessary.

07:27.734 --> 07:28.944
Actually, it is.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.387
You of all people.

07:30.453 --> 07:33.104
Trust me, I don't like this
any better than you do.

07:34.549 --> 07:35.695
Thank you.

07:36.631 --> 07:39.763
You talk to Lindsay, Corrine?
Yes.

07:40.918 --> 07:41.967
How're they doing?

07:42.038 --> 07:44.428
Your daughter seems lonely.
Do you get to see her often?

07:44.503 --> 07:46.511
Not as often as I should.

07:46.648 --> 07:48.403
I can't take Lindsay
blaming me anymore.

07:48.472 --> 07:50.381
Josh, it's not your fault.

07:52.889 --> 07:57.264
When that monster Marchek raped my
little girl, he killed a part of me.

07:57.881 --> 07:59.704
Your daughter is
still alive...

08:00.154 --> 08:01.909
and she misses you very much.

08:01.978 --> 08:03.833
Her mother won't let me
near her.

08:03.929 --> 08:05.904
She says they don't get
out very often.

08:05.978 --> 08:07.768
She shut herself off.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.473
I've tried to talk to her.

08:12.443 --> 08:16.055
I even bought her a car, hoping she'd take
Corrine to the country where she can...

08:16.124 --> 08:18.491
play outside and feel safe.

08:19.548 --> 08:21.752
What kind of car?
An Accord.

08:22.909 --> 08:24.054
Why?

08:25.309 --> 08:28.342
Does Lindsay take Corrine with her
when she goes out to run errands?

08:28.414 --> 08:31.381
No, the neighbor across
the hall stays with her.

08:31.933 --> 08:34.323
A sweet lady
named Virginia Koeler.

08:35.134 --> 08:36.662
You think Lindsay
killed the bastard?

08:36.734 --> 08:39.155
We don't think anything, Mrs.
Koeler. We're talking to everyone.

08:39.231 --> 08:41.597
You take care of Corrine when her
mother is out. Is that correct?

08:41.664 --> 08:43.671
I'm one of the only people
she trusts.

08:43.999 --> 08:46.366
After the terrible thing that
happened, she's very careful.

08:46.431 --> 08:48.504
You baby-sit Corrine last night? Why?

08:48.577 --> 08:51.325
Mrs. Koehler, do you think Lindsay
murdered her daughter's attacker?

08:51.393 --> 08:53.465
No.
Then tell us the truth.

08:53.537 --> 08:55.992
Did you stay with Corrine
last night?

08:59.074 --> 09:00.350
Yes.

09:01.122 --> 09:02.650
Lindsay went to the
grocery store.

09:02.722 --> 09:04.545
And what time did she return?

09:04.899 --> 09:06.328
About 11:00.

09:07.746 --> 09:09.787
She's all that
little girl has.

09:10.051 --> 09:11.840
Please leave her alone.

09:15.364 --> 09:18.943
The DMV lists Lindsay Branson as
the owner of a '98 blue Honda Accord.

09:19.011 --> 09:20.353
No tickets. No warrants.

09:20.421 --> 09:21.730
Any registered weapons?

09:21.796 --> 09:26.304
A Smith and Wesson 9mm registered to
Josh Branson, but not to the ex-wife.

09:26.757 --> 09:29.409
Pick her up. Okay, why
are we doing this, now?

09:29.477 --> 09:33.253
The gun is registered to the husband.
They're divorced. They live apart.

09:33.318 --> 09:34.692
I want her in a line-up.

09:34.854 --> 09:38.368
If Marchek's co-worker can ID Mrs. Branson
as the stalker, then we'll play it out.

09:38.439 --> 09:40.096
This is based on
circumstantial evidence.

09:40.167 --> 09:42.109
We've twisted suspects
in the wind for a lot less...

09:42.183 --> 09:43.558
than what we've got on
paper right now.

09:43.623 --> 09:45.380
Those suspects...

09:45.447 --> 09:48.797
didn't have a daughter who was
raped and had her face sliced up.

09:48.873 --> 09:50.815
She clears the line-up,
she goes home.

09:50.889 --> 09:51.969
I'm not doing this.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.765
Elliot.
No. You know something...

09:53.833 --> 09:56.289
this woman's already
living in hell.

09:56.457 --> 10:00.003
And now you're asking me to
drag her in like a criminal.

10:00.073 --> 10:02.213
I'm not doing it. This
isn't your call, Detective.

10:02.282 --> 10:05.064
Counselor, you know something,
I don't answer to you.

10:05.131 --> 10:06.593
You answer to me.

10:07.306 --> 10:11.465
And I suggest you adjust your attitude
before I write you up on insubordination.

10:20.812 --> 10:24.043
I just don't think we have
enough evidence. I say we do.

10:24.205 --> 10:26.213
Either get right with that
or go home.

10:43.568 --> 10:47.082
Can you identify the woman who
was following Tommy Marchek?

10:47.599 --> 10:48.975
Number three. That's her.

10:49.137 --> 10:50.381
Take your time.

10:50.673 --> 10:52.135
What for? It's number three.

10:52.978 --> 10:55.695
Can I go now? I got a lot
of deliveries to get out.

10:55.762 --> 10:56.809
Yeah.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.421
Search warrants were issued
for the premises and the car?

11:01.553 --> 11:03.081
Munch and Fin are on it.

11:03.251 --> 11:05.106
Are you gonna be able
to do the interrogation...

11:05.171 --> 11:07.211
or do I need to get
another set of detectives?

11:07.284 --> 11:08.844
It's not a problem.

11:15.603 --> 11:17.295
Can I get you anything?

11:17.524 --> 11:18.473
No.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.858
Do you understand your rights? Yes.

11:24.886 --> 11:26.609
Do you want a lawyer?

11:28.662 --> 11:31.030
Lindsay, I really think you
should have a lawyer present.

11:31.095 --> 11:32.404
I'm glad he's dead.

11:33.816 --> 11:35.538
I thought I'd have
some closure...

11:35.607 --> 11:36.720
but it hasn't made
a difference.

11:36.791 --> 11:40.915
Corrine is still afraid to go out and
then my family is still in shambles.

11:43.448 --> 11:45.358
Did you follow Mr. Marchek?

11:45.880 --> 11:47.025
Yes.

11:47.866 --> 11:51.728
To his home, his job, even to his
girlfriend's apartment on Lexington.

11:51.993 --> 11:55.506
Then each time I saw his face,
I saw him raping my little girl.

11:59.130 --> 12:01.072
How long had you been
stalking him?

12:02.202 --> 12:04.985
Since the day he got out of
prison, I've dreamed of his death.

12:05.052 --> 12:08.947
What I would do to him.
How I would make him suffer!

12:12.092 --> 12:13.914
Tell me what happened
last night.

12:16.893 --> 12:18.616
I followed him...

12:18.941 --> 12:20.021
from, um...

12:20.926 --> 12:24.668
from the meat market
to some bar in Alphabet City.

12:26.174 --> 12:28.279
And I waited for him outside.

12:28.766 --> 12:30.075
And did you have a gun?

12:30.815 --> 12:32.243
I had my husband's.

12:33.119 --> 12:36.502
I followed him for several
blocks on foot...

12:39.167 --> 12:41.273
his back made a
perfect target.

12:43.329 --> 12:44.953
But I couldn't do it.

12:46.497 --> 12:49.978
Every night I had the chance
and I just, I couldn't do it.

12:50.881 --> 12:53.402
And then somebody else
did it for me.

12:53.665 --> 12:54.844
Yeah.

13:03.651 --> 13:06.618
I don't have a confession.
You don't need one.

13:11.044 --> 13:13.795
Police. Step aside.
Thank you.

13:15.301 --> 13:16.828
Hey.
Hey.

13:17.509 --> 13:20.379
Olivia, I'd like you to meet
a recent parolee and rapist...

13:20.453 --> 13:22.145
Craig Moss, three shots
to the head.

13:22.214 --> 13:24.516
If Cragen finds out I called
you... I got it off the scanner.

13:24.582 --> 13:26.852
What's the deal here?
Check out this flyer.

13:27.879 --> 13:30.018
That's him. Second guy.

13:30.311 --> 13:32.646
Same MO, 9mm,
hollow-point slugs.

13:33.159 --> 13:35.166
Guess that lets Lindsay
off the hook.

13:35.431 --> 13:37.701
Puts us on the trail of a
serial killer.

13:44.009 --> 13:46.464
Did he suffer?
No, it was quick.

13:47.304 --> 13:49.760
But not quick enough,
right, Detective?

13:51.819 --> 13:53.858
Your son was murdered.

13:54.217 --> 13:56.159
We're trying to find out
who did it.

13:56.458 --> 13:58.662
What do you care?
It's our job.

13:59.915 --> 14:01.225
And my cross to bear.

14:01.290 --> 14:03.909
Mrs. Moss, this isn't about you. No?

14:04.779 --> 14:08.292
If my son hadn't been born, those
two women never would've been raped.

14:09.292 --> 14:12.457
I ask myself what I did wrong
and have no answers.

14:14.988 --> 14:18.764
Did your son mention anything about
having trouble with anyone lately?

14:19.437 --> 14:22.339
There were sex offender flyers
all over the neighborhood...

14:22.925 --> 14:25.609
obscenities spray-painted
on my door and...

14:25.839 --> 14:28.140
the man who beat him
to a pulp last week.

14:28.207 --> 14:30.030
Did your son tell you
who this man was?

14:30.095 --> 14:31.655
No, but I can guess.

14:32.112 --> 14:34.479
The owner of the
corner market, Pulham.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.558
He hated Craig.

14:37.169 --> 14:39.951
Had half-a-dozen flyers pasted
in the store window.

14:41.072 --> 14:42.795
I hated what he did...

14:43.505 --> 14:45.032
but I loved my son.

14:46.033 --> 14:47.278
He did his time...

14:48.241 --> 14:50.729
was raped in prison
and got HIV.

14:52.978 --> 14:54.604
He suffered, too.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.761
My brother-in-law said
to expect you.

14:59.827 --> 15:02.762
Your brother-in-law? Yeah,
he's a patrol cop in Queens.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.658
Figured my little run-in
with Craig the pervert...

15:04.724 --> 15:06.098
would put me at the
top of your list.

15:06.164 --> 15:08.499
According to Moss' mother,
you beat the hell out of him.

15:08.564 --> 15:10.451
I kicked him out of my store.

15:10.517 --> 15:11.761
And kept kicking?

15:12.149 --> 15:13.393
He's a rapist.

15:13.653 --> 15:14.603
Was.

15:16.086 --> 15:19.435
Look, I caught him checking out a couple
of teenage girls who came in for sodas.

15:19.510 --> 15:22.326
What am I supposed to do,
wait for him to rape them, too?

15:22.454 --> 15:24.658
Where were you last night
between 8:00 and 10:00?

15:24.791 --> 15:25.805
Right here.

15:25.879 --> 15:27.254
I'm open till 11:00
every night.

15:27.319 --> 15:29.458
And I got plenty of customers
who'll vouch for that.

15:29.527 --> 15:32.210
Who enlightened you about
Mr. Moss' background?

15:32.280 --> 15:34.189
A Citizen Watch guy came
in here with a flyer...

15:34.264 --> 15:35.988
asking me to post them
on my window.

15:36.056 --> 15:37.518
I asked for extras.

15:37.625 --> 15:40.178
He said this guy Moss
raped a mother of four.

15:40.409 --> 15:42.743
Predators like him,
they never stop.

15:42.809 --> 15:46.193
I run a family business. This
kind of scum ain't welcome here.

15:46.265 --> 15:49.081
You have any idea where we might be
able to find this Citizen Watch guy?

15:49.146 --> 15:52.310
Yeah, sure, they rent a space in the
Rec Center, couple of blocks down.

15:52.379 --> 15:56.055
They do a good job, too. I haven't
had a break-in in two years.

16:02.204 --> 16:04.594
Hello, Detectives, good to
see you again.

16:04.668 --> 16:06.456
This is not a social visit.

16:07.996 --> 16:10.102
We'd like you to stop
distributing these flyers.

16:10.173 --> 16:11.667
We're not breaking any laws.

16:11.742 --> 16:12.820
That remains to be seen.

16:13.341 --> 16:15.381
Mr. Pulham assaulted a man
on your flyer.

16:15.582 --> 16:17.491
And now two of them are dead.

16:17.886 --> 16:19.315
I'm sorry to hear that.

16:19.486 --> 16:21.876
We only try to inform
and prevent.

16:21.951 --> 16:24.919
You're inciting people to
break the law. To commit murder.

16:24.991 --> 16:26.878
That's a long reach, isn't it?
Is it?

16:26.943 --> 16:28.634
We've got two dead men...

16:28.703 --> 16:30.230
flyers that you've
distributed...

16:30.304 --> 16:33.054
and Citizen Watch members
at both crime scenes.

16:33.728 --> 16:34.939
Are we suspects?

16:35.009 --> 16:38.587
We'd like a list of your members,
names, addresses, phone numbers, please.

16:38.816 --> 16:40.541
You know, we're only
protecting ourselves

16:40.609 --> 16:42.944
against these rapists
because you won't.

16:43.425 --> 16:46.328
The system puts them in our
neighborhoods and then turns its back.

16:46.401 --> 16:48.377
And where exactly would you
like them to go?

16:48.451 --> 16:50.076
Hell's good and hot.

16:57.251 --> 16:58.364
Thank you.

17:03.076 --> 17:04.417
The Chief's idea of a joke?

17:04.483 --> 17:06.786
Much as I hate it, there's
nothing we can do.

17:06.853 --> 17:08.544
Protecting rapists now.

17:08.836 --> 17:10.528
To shield us from lawsuits...

17:10.597 --> 17:13.630
and to keep anyone else on
that flyer from being murdered.

17:14.662 --> 17:17.084
Now the remaining two parolees
on the list...

17:17.157 --> 17:20.257
Trent Wills and James Campbell, are
to get round-the-clock protection.

17:20.326 --> 17:21.788
Captain, what are we
supposed to do...

17:21.862 --> 17:25.157
about the honest, hard-working
people who actually need us?

17:27.367 --> 17:31.262
These men have rights and we
have jobs to do. Anything else?

17:31.592 --> 17:33.796
Ballistics came back on
Lindsay Branson's gun.

17:33.865 --> 17:34.759
No match.

17:34.889 --> 17:37.540
But we're looking at
the same 9mm for both stiffs.

17:37.609 --> 17:40.708
And we're running background checks
on all the Citizen Watch members.

17:40.778 --> 17:43.811
Well, this guy Winfield sounds
especially ripe.

17:44.074 --> 17:46.976
Talk to the two parolees. See if
any of these "concerned citizens"...

17:47.050 --> 17:49.058
were keeping too close a watch
on either one of them.

17:49.387 --> 17:50.433
We'll take Wills.

17:50.507 --> 17:52.263
And we'll take the other one.

17:52.363 --> 17:53.508
Elliot?

17:55.628 --> 17:57.601
How far you gonna push this,
Captain?

17:57.676 --> 18:00.043
No, since I assigned
this case...

18:00.108 --> 18:03.109
you have questioned my orders
and disrespected my command.

18:03.180 --> 18:05.417
Now, I've cut you some slack
because of our relationship...

18:05.485 --> 18:08.333
but this well is running
pretty dry. Are we clear?

18:09.197 --> 18:10.539
Yes, sir.

18:10.829 --> 18:12.968
I get enough crap from
the politicians.

18:13.038 --> 18:15.690
I don't need any from
my own detectives.

18:16.271 --> 18:17.993
I need a break, Elliot.

18:18.479 --> 18:19.973
Find me one.

18:27.247 --> 18:29.614
Police protection. Does this
mean I get a ride to work?

18:29.712 --> 18:30.760
No.

18:31.280 --> 18:34.096
Anybody been stalking you?
Giving you attitude?

18:34.288 --> 18:35.368
Yeah.

18:36.209 --> 18:38.598
Two fat, ugly, old broads
with matching windbreakers.

18:38.673 --> 18:42.318
I doubled back and spooked
the hell out of them.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.807
A fun time was had by all.

18:45.075 --> 18:46.504
Did you get their names?

18:46.931 --> 18:47.879
Yeah.

18:48.242 --> 18:51.559
Fat and Fatter,
Winfield's little army.

18:51.795 --> 18:54.381
Any babes in this
police detail?

18:57.653 --> 19:01.231
Been a long time.
Getting kind of anxious.

19:04.341 --> 19:06.228
Watch me, Daddy!

19:08.501 --> 19:11.023
Your mother-in-law said
we'd find you here.

19:11.094 --> 19:13.364
We try to live as normally
as possible...

19:13.431 --> 19:16.049
but that watch group is making
our lives miserable.

19:16.118 --> 19:19.696
After they put me on that
flyer, my boss fired me.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.622
Didn't want a pervert
selling insurance.

19:21.687 --> 19:24.502
Can you blame them for being
afraid? I'm not a danger to anybody.

19:24.567 --> 19:26.575
Would Sandra Woodly agree?

19:29.208 --> 19:30.931
I was 22.
I met her in a club.

19:31.001 --> 19:33.651
I wasn't thinking a 15-year-old
could even be out that late.

19:33.721 --> 19:35.631
She said she was 19.
Was that your defense?

19:35.705 --> 19:38.576
Look, I didn't deny any of it,
I went to prison.

19:38.650 --> 19:39.730
What more can I do?

19:39.802 --> 19:41.591
A protective detail will begin
at midnight...

19:41.658 --> 19:44.473
and continue around-the-clock
until the killer is found.

19:45.082 --> 19:46.544
You're saying that
we're at risk?

19:46.619 --> 19:49.816
Look, you're on the flyer, just like
the other two rapists who were killed.

19:49.883 --> 19:50.865
So?

19:50.939 --> 19:53.111
Has anyone from the watch
group been harassing you?

19:53.179 --> 19:54.424
Sam Winfield.

19:54.747 --> 19:58.872
He even tried to stop me from enrolling
my daughter in his kid's school.

19:58.940 --> 20:00.980
Who the hell does
he think he is?

20:01.629 --> 20:02.807
All roads lead to Winfield.

20:02.877 --> 20:06.042
Who is this guy?
An ex-cop from Albany.

20:06.173 --> 20:08.246
He took an early retirement
after a bad shoot.

20:08.318 --> 20:09.364
It doesn't prove anything.

20:09.438 --> 20:12.734
But I had a heart-to-heart with his
partner at the time of that bad shoot.

20:12.798 --> 20:13.977
It involved a rapist.

20:14.046 --> 20:17.177
He also has an arsenal
of weapons registered...

20:17.662 --> 20:19.157
including a 9mm.

20:19.295 --> 20:22.940
Marchek's girlfriend said a man from
the Citizen Watch was harassing them.

20:23.008 --> 20:25.113
And her friend said it
got pretty heated.

20:25.343 --> 20:26.718
Show them both the
photo array.

20:26.785 --> 20:29.949
If they can ID him, let's invite
him down here for a little chat.

20:33.154 --> 20:34.942
There you go. She's doing
so well.

20:35.009 --> 20:36.057
She's a brave little girl.

20:36.129 --> 20:38.268
Thank you.
I'll see you next week.

20:38.337 --> 20:40.704
Louise Durning?
Yes?

20:40.770 --> 20:43.804
I'm Detective Benson. This is
my partner, Detective Stabler.

20:43.875 --> 20:46.296
You're here about Gloria?

20:46.722 --> 20:48.129
Come this way.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.953
We understand you were with
Gloria and Thomas Marchek...

20:53.028 --> 20:55.614
when a man from Citizen Watch
approached you.

20:55.684 --> 20:57.245
Yes. In the restaurant.

20:57.316 --> 20:59.455
Do you think you'd remember
this man if you saw him again?

20:59.524 --> 21:00.670
I think so.

21:00.741 --> 21:03.076
Okay, can you tell us if he's
one of these?

21:03.908 --> 21:05.338
Yes, he's this one.

21:05.414 --> 21:07.454
Do you think he had something
to do with Thomas' murder?

21:07.526 --> 21:09.982
Do you remember what he said
in the restaurant?

21:10.182 --> 21:11.524
Nothing to me.

21:11.783 --> 21:14.816
He showed Thomas his gun
and told him to watch out.

21:15.623 --> 21:17.795
I already gave a statement.
What more do you need?

21:17.862 --> 21:19.871
You said Sam Winfield, the
guy from the community watch...

21:19.943 --> 21:21.221
harassed you and Tommy.

21:21.287 --> 21:22.368
He followed us everywhere.

21:22.440 --> 21:25.572
Even came in here a couple of times,
went straight to Glo's station.

21:25.640 --> 21:28.640
I tried to avoid him, but he complained
to my manager. I had to wait on him.

21:28.713 --> 21:31.495
Did he say anything?
Awful stuff about Tommy.

21:31.561 --> 21:34.660
He said if I knew what was good for me,
I'd leave him and never see him again.

21:34.730 --> 21:37.064
One time Tommy came in
and he was talking to Glo...

21:37.129 --> 21:39.040
I thought for sure there
was gonna be hell to pay.

21:39.115 --> 21:41.351
What happened? Tommy
grabbed Winfield by the shirt

21:41.419 --> 21:42.727
lifted him right out of
his chair.

21:42.794 --> 21:45.097
Winfield split Tommy's head
open with an ashtray.

21:45.771 --> 21:48.674
Said if he ever touched him
again, he'd kill him.

21:50.443 --> 21:51.621
Finally caught up with Gloria.

21:51.692 --> 21:53.253
She ID'd Winfield from
the array...

21:53.324 --> 21:55.365
and confirmed that he
threatened Marchek with a gun.

21:55.437 --> 21:56.963
Now she's scared for her life.

21:57.324 --> 22:00.706
At the rate this guy's going, we're gonna
have to assign another protection detail.

22:00.781 --> 22:04.938
Dispatch just got a call from the
Campbell residence. Shots fired.

22:07.181 --> 22:09.735
Scared the hell out of my wife
and little girl.

22:09.806 --> 22:11.594
And where are they now?

22:11.887 --> 22:14.276
I sent them to a motel where
they'll be safe.

22:14.351 --> 22:16.718
Not that you give a damn what
happens to me or my family.

22:16.784 --> 22:18.408
That's not true, Mr. Campbell.

22:18.480 --> 22:21.349
Well, then where was that
protective detail that you promised?

22:21.424 --> 22:23.497
The shift doesn't start
until midnight.

22:23.984 --> 22:25.773
How convenient.

22:26.545 --> 22:28.650
Did you see who
fired the shots?

22:29.105 --> 22:30.283
I didn't have to.

22:30.353 --> 22:34.380
I saw Winfield standing across the
street, staring at the apartment.

22:34.450 --> 22:36.043
A few minutes later
the window explodes.

22:36.114 --> 22:37.129
Had he threatened you?

22:37.203 --> 22:38.729
Coming up the street he
grabbed me,

22:38.802 --> 22:40.461
and told me to get out of
the neighborhood.

22:40.530 --> 22:42.353
When I told him to
go to hell...

22:42.419 --> 22:45.715
he said if I didn't listen, I was
gonna end up like the other two guys.

22:45.875 --> 22:50.132
Okay. When the protective detail gets
here, we'll escort your family back home.

22:50.932 --> 22:52.590
No, thanks, Detective...

22:53.107 --> 22:54.897
they're safer where they are.

22:59.990 --> 23:03.121
I worked at the shop until
10:00. Then I went home.

23:03.190 --> 23:05.012
You go out for dinner break?
About 6:00.

23:05.078 --> 23:06.191
Where'd you go?

23:06.966 --> 23:08.112
For a walk.

23:08.182 --> 23:11.379
James Campbell said that you wound
up at his place, threatened his life.

23:11.446 --> 23:13.836
I tried to save his neck,
but he wouldn't listen.

23:13.912 --> 23:16.629
Instead he gets in my face,
calls me a stalker.

23:17.144 --> 23:20.757
I don't have to take that from
anyone, least of all a stinking rapist.

23:20.825 --> 23:22.767
That why you took a
shot at him?

23:24.056 --> 23:25.748
I didn't shoot at anybody.

23:25.816 --> 23:27.278
He saw you outside his window.

23:27.480 --> 23:31.191
He was mistaken. Like I said,
I was at work.

23:31.354 --> 23:32.696
Anybody with you?

23:33.145 --> 23:34.772
My partner Paul Cormick.

23:37.850 --> 23:40.338
We're rebuilding an engine,
the block is cracked.

23:40.635 --> 23:42.261
How many guns do you own?

23:42.459 --> 23:43.408
Five...

23:44.027 --> 23:47.160
counting the engraved Marine Dragoon.
But you already know that, don't you?

23:47.227 --> 23:48.471
You expecting a war?

23:48.540 --> 23:51.704
I shoot competitively.
But you know that, too.

23:53.725 --> 23:55.002
Tell you what...

23:55.740 --> 23:58.775
why don't the two of you
tell me what you want...

23:58.846 --> 24:01.267
and I'll tell you if I'm gonna
make it easy...

24:01.662 --> 24:02.808
or I'm gonna make it hard.

24:02.878 --> 24:04.951
Give up your 9mm for testing.
No.

24:05.022 --> 24:07.739
Then why do we have to
go through this, then?

24:08.031 --> 24:10.301
You gonna play us, we'll
just keep right on digging.

24:10.368 --> 24:12.091
Then grab a shovel, brother.

24:12.159 --> 24:15.608
No probable cause, no warrant,
no guns.

24:15.679 --> 24:17.687
We know that you followed
these guys.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.727
And no one filed a complaint,
so what's the problem?

24:20.800 --> 24:23.005
The problem is anyone you
don't like, they wind up dead.

24:23.072 --> 24:25.048
Pedophiles and rapists.

24:25.569 --> 24:26.944
Don't waste your pity.

24:29.346 --> 24:31.964
You used to be a good cop,
what happened?

24:38.018 --> 24:40.736
Are you guys gonna charge me
with anything?

24:42.307 --> 24:43.998
Or can I go home now?

24:46.692 --> 24:48.253
That was Munch.

24:48.420 --> 24:51.552
Cormick's wife puts her
husband at home by 9:00 pm.

24:51.813 --> 24:53.755
Well, there goes
Winfield's alibi.

24:53.957 --> 24:56.194
We'll need warrants to cover
the garage and home.

24:56.261 --> 24:57.822
Cabot's already on it.

24:58.980 --> 25:00.388
Take a look at this.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.105
I called Winfield's captain
in Albany.

25:03.174 --> 25:05.695
Got the off-the-record on
his bad shoot.

25:06.246 --> 25:09.282
Turns out the gun the perp was
carrying had no prints.

25:09.415 --> 25:10.363
It was a drop?

25:10.471 --> 25:12.228
Serial number was filed clean.

25:12.296 --> 25:15.460
Winfield had eight
commendations up to that point?

25:15.529 --> 25:17.984
That's why they offered him
early retirement.

25:18.632 --> 25:20.837
The case he was working on
was real bad ass.

25:20.905 --> 25:22.945
Captain said it ate him
to the bone.

25:23.944 --> 25:25.701
The warrants are on the way.

25:25.768 --> 25:27.624
I already sent Munch and Fin
to the residence.

25:27.689 --> 25:30.537
You two go to the business.
The unis'll meet you there.

25:37.450 --> 25:38.760
What the hell is this?

25:38.827 --> 25:41.032
Sorry, Sam. I couldn't
stop them.

25:51.245 --> 25:52.936
So much for professional
courtesy.

25:53.004 --> 25:54.249
You brought this on yourself.

25:54.316 --> 25:56.651
Just another day on the
thin blue line, Detective?

25:56.942 --> 25:58.153
You better watch out.
Yeah.

25:58.221 --> 25:59.597
Or you'll wind up just
like me.

25:59.662 --> 26:00.807
Well, thanks for the advice.

26:00.879 --> 26:03.432
Just let us do our job
and we'll be out of your hair.

26:05.263 --> 26:07.172
You all right?
Yep.

26:07.792 --> 26:08.806
I'll get the first-aid kit.

26:08.879 --> 26:12.360
Detectives, found this
in an oil drum out back.

26:13.809 --> 26:17.158
Mr. Winfield, I won't forget
about that first aid kit.

26:17.232 --> 26:20.298
You're under arrest for the murder
of Thomas Marchek and Craig Moss...

26:20.369 --> 26:22.279
and the attempted murder
of James Campbell.

26:22.354 --> 26:24.972
You have the right to remain
silent. I know my rights.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.951
Well, then, let's get out
of here.

26:28.979 --> 26:31.500
Ballistics report came back
positive for the Campbell attack.

26:31.570 --> 26:32.944
But it's no match on
the murders.

26:33.011 --> 26:34.418
You sure?
Tested it twice.

26:34.483 --> 26:35.727
We don't have the
murder weapon.

26:35.796 --> 26:36.875
Then we don't have a case.

26:36.947 --> 26:39.598
The most I can charge him with is
attempted murder on Mr. Campbell.

26:39.668 --> 26:41.838
Unless you play hardball.
What are you suggesting?

26:41.908 --> 26:45.007
You could threaten to kick up enough
dust to re-open the Albany investigation.

26:45.076 --> 26:47.443
Look, wait a minute,
I read the file.

26:47.508 --> 26:50.062
There was a kid in the car and
he thought the perp was carrying.

26:50.133 --> 26:52.371
The skell had already raped
and tortured the kid's mother.

26:52.437 --> 26:54.859
I know the facts. But we've
got two murders to close.

26:54.934 --> 26:57.782
So we pad our win column at
the expense of a good cop...

26:57.846 --> 26:59.056
because he made a
judgment call?

26:59.126 --> 27:02.061
If he killed those men, I don't give
a damn how many commendations he had.

27:02.134 --> 27:03.891
He's a murderer and we're
going to nail his ass.

27:03.958 --> 27:05.388
Now do you have a
problem with that?

27:06.455 --> 27:09.936
All I'm saying... What? What
are you saying, Detective?

27:11.416 --> 27:13.489
I think I understand him.

27:14.040 --> 27:16.429
And I'm asking for a
shot at him.

27:30.875 --> 27:32.566
You know, these rooms all
look the same.

27:33.562 --> 27:35.864
They've got one up in Albany
with a window just like this one.

27:35.931 --> 27:38.037
Same rusty gratings,
same size.

27:39.292 --> 27:41.201
Rooms even smell the same.

27:41.276 --> 27:43.611
How long on the job?
Sixteen years.

27:43.675 --> 27:46.011
Solid, from what I hear.

27:47.325 --> 27:49.147
I was on my way to
being Captain.

27:51.613 --> 27:53.500
Then Alan Cryter came along.

27:56.478 --> 27:58.168
I had my own Alan Cryter.

27:59.423 --> 28:03.482
Insurance salesman. Ran his business
out of a converted garage in Queens.

28:04.319 --> 28:09.055
Well liked. Would invite the neighborhood
kids up for ice cream and stories.

28:09.248 --> 28:12.477
One day, a six-year-old girl
goes missing...

28:12.544 --> 28:15.097
from a playground in Soho.

28:15.553 --> 28:17.081
Actually...

28:17.410 --> 28:20.093
long story short,
we find her...

28:20.321 --> 28:24.577
underneath the floorboards of his
office, along with three other children.

28:24.674 --> 28:27.773
All of them in various
stages of decomposition.

28:28.098 --> 28:31.896
But he is gone,
and I'm left...

28:32.003 --> 28:33.312
with a cold case.

28:34.340 --> 28:38.202
And two years nothing
but silence...

28:39.236 --> 28:40.513
and headaches.

28:42.692 --> 28:44.764
I developed these
debilitating headaches.

28:44.837 --> 28:46.725
I wasn't sleeping a lot.

28:46.853 --> 28:49.701
I kept having these
recurring nightmares...

28:50.437 --> 28:52.826
where my own children would be
underneath these floorboards...

28:52.902 --> 28:54.844
that I couldn't pry up.

28:56.583 --> 29:01.089
And then one day I'm just gassing
up my car in Chelsea and there he is.

29:02.055 --> 29:04.772
And before I know it
I've got his face...

29:05.063 --> 29:08.643
sandwiched between his windshield
and the muzzle of my gun.

29:09.031 --> 29:11.520
And I'm yelling, "Freeze."

29:12.712 --> 29:15.200
And I realize that I'm yelling
at myself.

29:16.745 --> 29:20.193
Because I can't stop my finger
from pulling the trigger.

29:20.265 --> 29:23.746
And I'm praying for him to blink.
I'm praying for him to twitch.

29:23.818 --> 29:27.016
Just do something to give
me an excuse.

29:28.139 --> 29:30.822
And then I see a face
inside of his car.

29:32.747 --> 29:33.697
It's...

29:35.756 --> 29:38.953
a girl, this beautiful,
little six-year-old girl...

29:39.629 --> 29:41.701
these big eyes.

29:46.253 --> 29:48.163
I figured she'd seen enough.

29:51.534 --> 29:53.444
Yeah, she'd seen enough.

29:57.999 --> 29:59.822
Your headaches go away?

30:01.616 --> 30:02.729
Yeah.

30:04.944 --> 30:07.366
It's the only difference
between us.

30:12.017 --> 30:14.024
I didn't see the kid's eyes.

30:14.577 --> 30:18.352
The perp pulled him from the
car and used him as a shield.

30:20.658 --> 30:23.026
After what the loser had done
to the mother and the sister...

30:23.090 --> 30:25.000
I had no doubts what he'd do
with the boy.

30:25.074 --> 30:28.817
Anyway, the boy bit him
and ran. I shot.

30:32.084 --> 30:35.117
I could have sworn that
son of a bitch had a gun.

30:35.733 --> 30:36.977
But maybe...

30:39.221 --> 30:40.748
it was just wishful thinking.

30:55.319 --> 30:57.294
We've got to do the
right thing here.

31:06.201 --> 31:07.892
I didn't kill those men.

31:09.338 --> 31:12.240
I handed out flyers to inform
and prevent. That's all.

31:12.826 --> 31:13.971
James Campbell?

31:14.330 --> 31:15.955
James Campbell was next
on the list.

31:16.026 --> 31:19.736
I figured if I scared him off,
at least he'd be alive.

31:22.138 --> 31:23.698
Anything else you can tell me?

31:29.180 --> 31:31.995
On the night of Marchek's
murder, I was on duty.

31:32.955 --> 31:35.345
I heard the shots.
I ran towards the sound.

31:36.444 --> 31:40.535
When I got there, I saw a
woman fleeing the crime scene.

31:41.469 --> 31:42.779
Description?

31:45.502 --> 31:48.568
5'6", brown hair, 120-ish Ibs.

31:49.022 --> 31:52.765
Black leather jacket, flapping open,
blue sequined top, dark pants...

31:53.374 --> 31:54.486
boots.

32:00.096 --> 32:02.332
Why didn't you tell us
this before?

32:04.480 --> 32:08.125
When I saw it was Marchek, I
figured he got what he deserved.

32:16.290 --> 32:18.844
Can you do me any favors
on this?

32:25.283 --> 32:27.487
Gloria's not here, Detective.
She's off today.

32:27.556 --> 32:30.044
But she was on Thursday.
Yeah. Why?

32:30.116 --> 32:32.321
Her time card said she
worked till 3:00 am.

32:32.388 --> 32:34.624
So?
She work the whole night?

32:34.692 --> 32:35.640
Must've.

32:35.717 --> 32:38.138
How well did you know her
boyfriend? Not very well.

32:38.213 --> 32:39.391
She said he was nice.

32:39.462 --> 32:41.698
Which she deserved after the
long line of scuzzballs...

32:41.764 --> 32:44.067
who mooched her money
and beat the crap out of her.

32:44.134 --> 32:45.661
It was sad when they broke up.

32:45.734 --> 32:47.742
Broke up? When did
that happen?

32:47.814 --> 32:50.433
About a week ago.
Glo took it hard.

32:50.695 --> 32:52.288
I think she still loved him.

32:52.359 --> 32:54.880
Missed a lot of work.
Almost got canned.

32:54.951 --> 32:56.958
But she worked until 3:00
last Thursday?

32:57.320 --> 32:59.011
You checked her time card.

32:59.080 --> 33:01.121
We have a witness that
says otherwise.

33:01.192 --> 33:03.648
Unless you want to be charged
as accessory to murder,

33:03.721 --> 33:06.023
I suggest you tell us
the truth.

33:09.576 --> 33:11.944
Gloria ducked out about 11:00.

33:12.010 --> 33:13.603
Where'd she go?
I don't know.

33:13.673 --> 33:16.009
Did she come back?
No.

33:16.427 --> 33:19.460
Manager didn't miss her, so I
punched her card when I left.

33:19.530 --> 33:22.313
Did she work night before
last? It was her night off.

33:23.178 --> 33:25.546
Look, I know Gloria.

33:25.612 --> 33:28.743
She's a little messed up,
but she's a sweet girl.

33:28.812 --> 33:30.534
She wouldn't hurt anybody.

33:31.692 --> 33:34.758
You sure about that?
Okay, John, thanks a lot.

33:34.829 --> 33:36.836
Seems Gloria's alibi
just went south.

33:36.908 --> 33:37.924
Here it is.

33:40.557 --> 33:41.507
Gloria!

33:42.157 --> 33:45.386
Detectives Benson and Stabler.
We spoke this morning.

33:45.679 --> 33:46.661
Wow.

33:47.118 --> 33:49.988
She said that she'd be here,
as if she could really hear me.

33:51.151 --> 33:52.165
Gloria?

33:52.239 --> 33:55.141
Damn inconsiderate.
Did you get any answer?

33:55.215 --> 33:56.263
And who are you?

33:56.336 --> 33:59.948
Earl Zito, I live below
in 2-C. Listen to that.

34:00.016 --> 34:02.350
How long's this been going on?
Over an hour.

34:02.416 --> 34:05.483
Yeah, I called the super,
but you know, it's...

34:05.553 --> 34:07.527
Stay there please.

34:07.602 --> 34:09.489
I hope the deadbolt isn't on.

34:18.514 --> 34:19.659
Olivia!

34:22.931 --> 34:25.866
Call for a wagon. I got
a pulse here. Very faint.

34:26.612 --> 34:28.849
2414 to central.
2414 to central.

34:29.813 --> 34:31.984
Got a 1054
attempted suicide...

34:32.053 --> 34:35.020
at 28 Lexington Avenue
and 26th Street.

34:35.125 --> 34:36.369
Put a rush on the bus.

34:36.469 --> 34:38.127
Grab another towel.
I'm making a tourniquet.

34:38.197 --> 34:39.373
Bus is on the way.

34:39.446 --> 34:41.585
Okay. Here's the tourniquet.

34:42.422 --> 34:43.829
Can you tie the other
one for me?

34:43.895 --> 34:47.059
We need to get her downstairs.
Gloria, can you hear me?

34:47.286 --> 34:48.716
Stay with me.

34:50.775 --> 34:52.053
She's a lucky young woman...

34:52.120 --> 34:54.608
another minute or two and
she would've bled to death.

34:54.936 --> 34:56.659
Can we talk to her now?

34:56.791 --> 35:01.070
Before you do, I need to inform
you about your potential exposure.

35:01.657 --> 35:02.900
To what?

35:03.513 --> 35:07.441
The paramedics found Viracept, a protease
inhibitor, in Gloria's medicine cabinet.

35:07.674 --> 35:10.456
She confirmed that
she's HIV-positive.

35:11.001 --> 35:13.686
Since there was a lot of blood
at the scene...

35:14.043 --> 35:16.825
Elliot. Okay, Doc.
Thanks for the heads-up.

35:17.883 --> 35:20.272
We should talk to Gloria
while she's still awake.

35:23.772 --> 35:25.779
You should've just let me die.

35:25.915 --> 35:27.476
That's not an answer.

35:27.549 --> 35:29.523
How do you know?

35:29.948 --> 35:32.404
Did you hurt yourself
because of Tommy Marchek?

35:32.733 --> 35:33.681
Yes.

35:34.237 --> 35:35.895
Because he broke up with you?

35:36.381 --> 35:37.494
I broke up with him.

35:37.566 --> 35:41.145
Why?
Son of a bitch gave me HIV.

35:42.047 --> 35:43.541
Is that why you killed him?

35:44.094 --> 35:45.403
Isn't that enough?

35:46.655 --> 35:47.736
And Moss?

35:49.919 --> 35:50.901
Who?

35:51.231 --> 35:52.508
Craig Moss.

35:55.328 --> 35:56.855
I killed him, too.

36:00.449 --> 36:02.905
Why'd you use a knife on him?
What do you care?

36:04.098 --> 36:06.399
He's dead. I did it.

36:07.554 --> 36:08.960
Now leave me alone.

36:16.419 --> 36:18.110
She's lying.
She's protecting someone.

36:18.179 --> 36:20.001
The question is, who?

36:20.068 --> 36:23.264
We still haven't found any
connection between Gloria and Moss.

36:23.332 --> 36:25.274
I don't even think she
knew the guy.

36:25.348 --> 36:27.520
Hold on. Wait a minute.

36:28.102 --> 36:30.916
Gloria said Marchek
gave her HIV.

36:31.205 --> 36:33.661
Moss had HIV.

36:34.118 --> 36:37.729
Did CSU get everything
from her medicine cabinet?

36:39.462 --> 36:40.411
Yeah.

36:49.895 --> 36:53.857
Viracept. It was prescribed by a Dr.
Williams at the State Street Clinic.

36:53.992 --> 36:58.564
Crime lab reports Marchek and Moss
both got their meds from the same place.

36:59.017 --> 37:01.188
Gloria's friend, Louise,
works there as a social worker.

37:01.257 --> 37:03.526
How much you wanna bet she
counseled Marchek and Moss?

37:03.594 --> 37:05.895
Check the phone records
and meds on all three...

37:05.962 --> 37:08.482
and run a background check.
Then bring her in.

37:13.451 --> 37:16.582
How long has she been waiting?
Twenty minutes.

37:16.907 --> 37:18.631
Doesn't look too rattled.

37:19.692 --> 37:22.823
She brought work with her from
the clinic. Now that's dedication.

37:22.892 --> 37:25.762
She's also got a permit for
a 9mm Glock.

37:31.246 --> 37:32.456
Finished?

37:34.574 --> 37:37.127
My work is never finished.

37:37.486 --> 37:39.493
Seems a lot like our job.

37:40.462 --> 37:43.529
Well, in your job,
don't you sometimes win?

37:44.496 --> 37:49.002
What I meant was don't you
people say that...

37:49.360 --> 37:51.914
HIV is no longer a
death sentence?

37:53.233 --> 37:54.793
Yes, we do.

37:55.088 --> 37:57.904
We can treat it,
but we can't cure it.

37:59.154 --> 38:02.383
We were hoping that you could
tie up some loose ends for us.

38:02.961 --> 38:05.929
What kind of loose ends?
Thomas Marchek, Craig Moss...

38:06.162 --> 38:08.650
they were patients of
yours, weren't they? Yes.

38:09.746 --> 38:13.129
Gloria Palmera?
Yes. Yeah.

38:13.300 --> 38:15.634
Gloria confessed to murdering
Marchek and Moss.

38:17.844 --> 38:19.306
She did?

38:19.379 --> 38:22.795
After she tried to kill
herself last night.

38:24.629 --> 38:26.516
Oh, God.

38:27.958 --> 38:29.746
Is she all right?

38:31.573 --> 38:33.777
Well, she's weak.
She's confused.

38:34.230 --> 38:36.597
She wasn't really making
a whole lot of sense.

38:39.222 --> 38:41.841
That's because she was trying
to protect me.

38:47.191 --> 38:48.304
Tell us.

38:50.712 --> 38:55.055
I counseled Thomas Marchek
for four months.

38:55.610 --> 38:58.544
And he told me he wasn't
being intimate with anyone.

38:59.321 --> 39:01.460
And then one session
he let it slip.

39:01.946 --> 39:06.386
Bragged about his girlfriend's
insatiable appetite for him.

39:07.771 --> 39:10.737
I told him to tell Gloria
to come in to be tested.

39:10.939 --> 39:13.175
Did she?
No.

39:13.243 --> 39:17.881
He kept making excuses about why
he hadn't told her. So I told her.

39:18.364 --> 39:20.121
At first she wouldn't
believe it...

39:20.188 --> 39:22.840
but then when the test results
came back positive...

39:22.909 --> 39:26.073
she finally saw him
for the bastard that he was.

39:28.382 --> 39:29.876
Why did you kill him?

39:33.086 --> 39:35.869
He murdered her with his lies.

39:36.478 --> 39:37.973
That's why.

39:39.999 --> 39:41.243
And Moss?

39:41.888 --> 39:46.263
Why would I give him another chance
to do that again to somebody else?

39:47.584 --> 39:49.723
It's bad enough to be
raped, Detective...

39:49.921 --> 39:52.856
but when the rapist has HIV, he
leaves you with a daily reminder...

39:52.929 --> 39:55.100
that'll last you for the
rest of your life.

39:57.538 --> 40:01.183
I know, I was raped
nine years ago.

40:07.011 --> 40:08.921
You're HIV-positive?

40:09.602 --> 40:12.637
No, I have AIDS.

40:13.091 --> 40:14.368
I'm dying.

40:15.172 --> 40:17.343
Drugs don't work for
me anymore.

40:21.413 --> 40:24.097
I wasn't gonna let them kill
another woman.

40:39.878 --> 40:41.767
You think the Grand Jury will
indict her?

40:41.896 --> 40:44.099
She did murder two men.

40:44.423 --> 40:46.977
Will she live long enough
to serve her sentence?

40:53.865 --> 40:54.944
You okay?

40:56.649 --> 41:00.676
You wanna go grab a drink?
No, I should go home.

41:01.258 --> 41:02.665
Sure?
Yeah.

41:03.690 --> 41:07.105
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
You will.

41:13.036 --> 41:14.181
Elliot...

41:15.820 --> 41:17.478
how'd it go with the doc?

41:17.964 --> 41:22.503
She said the bandage probably kept most
of Gloria's blood from entering the wound.

41:23.021 --> 41:27.625
Just in case, she gave me a
month's supply of antiretrovirals.

41:27.694 --> 41:29.734
Then what?
Wait and see.

41:29.806 --> 41:31.813
That's gonna make for a
hell of a month.

41:33.679 --> 41:36.974
Listen, if there's anything...
I got it covered.

41:37.711 --> 41:39.949
Well, you got my number.

41:40.207 --> 41:41.156
Captain?

41:43.536 --> 41:44.485
Thanks.
