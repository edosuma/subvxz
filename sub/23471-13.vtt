00:05.005 --> 00:07.757
[theme song playing]

00:55.055 --> 00:56.598
-[indistinct announcement over PA]
-Hi.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.476
Hey, Pen, I got Lydia's stuff
you asked for.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.770
Fuzzy afghan she likes,
picture of the Pope,

01:01.853 --> 01:05.648
picture of a different Pope, picture of
your dad, picture of the family,

01:05.732 --> 01:08.651
picture of me with the family,
picture of me by a waterfall.

01:09.569 --> 01:12.489
I'm just gonna keep talking
'cause I'm not good in crisis situations.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.700
This isn't a crisis.
Everybody, the surgery went well.

01:15.784 --> 01:18.870
It prevented a stroke.
Now she's in a medically-induced coma.

01:18.953 --> 01:20.497
Just have to wait for her to wake up.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.373
She's gonna wake up, right?

01:22.457 --> 01:25.794
Yes, of course.
But you know this woman can't be rushed.

01:25.877 --> 01:29.380
My wedding started half an hour late
because she needed to adjust her tiara.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.635
Yes, she wore a tiara to my wedding.

01:33.718 --> 01:36.429
She wanted to match
a little figure of herself on the cake.

01:38.973 --> 01:42.268
No. Up, up, up, up.
There will be no crying.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.229
Your  abuelita
hates everything about crying.

01:44.979 --> 01:47.899
Makes your eyes puffy, ruins your makeup,
gives you  mocos.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.861
She did once tell me
tears are the pee-pee of the face.

01:55.907 --> 01:58.535
-Good vibes only. Okay?
-[sighs]

01:58.618 --> 02:00.286
-Good vibes.
-Good vibes.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.538
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

02:07.252 --> 02:12.173
Hi,  Mami.  Look who's here.
Alex, put this on her.

02:12.257 --> 02:17.220
Elena,  Papi  on the nightstand,
popes on the dresser,

02:18.763 --> 02:21.224
and Schneider by the waterfall...

02:24.602 --> 02:25.937
in hazardous waste.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.068
-What's up?
-Oh, hi, Nurse Wally.

02:35.446 --> 02:36.573
These your kids?

02:36.656 --> 02:38.658
Oh, no. These are children
I picked up outside,

02:38.741 --> 02:40.660
so I can show them what a coma looks like.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.996
[chuckles softly]

02:43.079 --> 02:46.291
Funny. Did you know
that your mom is also a nurse?

02:46.374 --> 02:49.836
I do. She's only told me, like,
a hundred times.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.089
-This is running low.
-That's literally why I'm here.

02:53.172 --> 02:54.883
That's why you brought a refill, right?

02:57.719 --> 02:59.137
I'll be right back.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.478
Why don't you two go get something
to eat at the cafeteria?

03:08.104 --> 03:10.940
I swiped Nurse Wally's ID
so you can get 10% off.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.737
Mami,  you go. I'll hang out with  Abuelita.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.158
Okay.

03:30.168 --> 03:33.463
Okay,  Abuelita.  It's only you and me now.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.132
Just the way you like it.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.636
[sighs]

03:40.345 --> 03:45.516
I know you haven't had time,
but your nails are a disaster.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.021
Don't worry. I got you covered.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.571
So, you'll never believe
what happened at church today.

04:02.075 --> 04:06.204
That's right, we went.
Mami,  me, even Elena.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.539
And, no, she didn't burst into flames.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.877
I thought you'd like that one.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.172
Anyway,  Padre  Jose did the homily.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.341
And I actually learned something.

04:18.424 --> 04:21.886
"To whom much has been given,
much will be required."

04:21.970 --> 04:22.929
That's from Luke.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.431
But it's also from  Spider-Man.

04:28.559 --> 04:31.271
You know who Jesus said that to? Peter.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.106
Parker?

04:33.690 --> 04:35.942
[mouthing] What?

04:41.948 --> 04:43.700
Anyway, a couple FYIs.

04:43.783 --> 04:47.328
I made sure to record  El Amor y la Sangre.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.456
You will not believe
what Rosalita did to Maria Luisa.

04:51.040 --> 04:54.877
No spoilers, but  Francisco está vivo.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.547
[vocalizes]

04:58.881 --> 05:01.676
[sighs] Okay, that's all
I'm gonna give you.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.474
Okay, I think we're good.

05:11.811 --> 05:15.648
Te quiero, Abuelita.
I know you'll wake up soon.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.859
[door opens]

05:18.443 --> 05:20.445
Hi, Alex. How's our girl?

05:21.154 --> 05:25.033
Just waiting for her to wake up.
You know she doesn't like being rushed.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.910
"Would you tell a rose to bloom faster?"

05:27.994 --> 05:29.454
[chuckles]

05:30.788 --> 05:34.876
Oh, hi. I'm a friend of the family.
Dr. Leslie Berkowitz.

05:34.959 --> 05:38.546
Oh, she has her own nurse,
she has her own doctor.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.883
Should I pull up a chair for her dentist?

05:43.968 --> 05:46.679
-Oh, hi, Doc.
-Hey. I hope I'm not intruding.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.931
No, no. The more the merrier. Yeah.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.226
Tío  Felix is on his way
with sangria and a karaoke machine.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.686
[chuckles]

05:53.770 --> 05:56.481
Oh, okay, so this is probably
a good time to tell you

05:56.564 --> 05:58.649
that visiting hours are almost over.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.818
[laughs] Okay.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.530
Uh, this is probably a good time
to tell you we're Cuban.

06:05.907 --> 06:11.662
Great. I am from Pittsburgh,
but visiting hours are still almost over.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.706
You don't get it, Nurse Wally.

06:14.123 --> 06:17.376
My mom will not be left alone
for one second.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.378
When my  Tía  Mimi got sick,

06:19.462 --> 06:21.672
13 of us spent the night
praying at her bedside

06:21.756 --> 06:23.132
and she just had pink eye.

06:23.966 --> 06:25.802
And then we all got pink eye.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.430
So that's what's up. You got it?

06:30.515 --> 06:34.143
You're little, but I'm afraid of you.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.813
Good.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.440
I gotta prep this bed.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.653
I am definitely not hiding.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.616
Alex, come with me.

06:48.699 --> 06:52.161
Elena said the cafeteria food
is a conspiracy to keep people sick,

06:52.245 --> 06:54.413
so it's all aboard the Panda Express.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.792
Anything happens, you text me.
I'll be here in a second.

06:58.793 --> 07:02.088
Oh. Her nails are drying,
so no hand-holding.

07:04.507 --> 07:05.508
[sighs]

07:08.719 --> 07:10.555
I gotta say, Lydia,

07:10.638 --> 07:13.474
you even make a hospital gown
seem glamorous.

07:14.642 --> 07:18.020
But something is missing.

07:20.481 --> 07:22.942
-Uh-huh.
-[soft music playing]

07:28.114 --> 07:29.115
There you go.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.788
I'm so sorry this happened
on your big day, Lydia.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.584
Strange seeing you so still and quiet.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.712
You are the most alive person I know.

07:43.337 --> 07:46.716
Whenever I'm around you,
I feel like I'm in an opera.

07:46.799 --> 07:51.137
Everything is dramatic and exciting,
and in a language I don't understand.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.310
And I never want the show to end.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.229
You are my favorite diva.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.065
You make me feel like a young man of 45.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.527
And I haven't felt 45 since I was 22.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.741
So... I don't care

08:12.283 --> 08:16.245
what we call our relationship
or friendship or whatever.

08:17.413 --> 08:21.667
My time with you
is the only thing that makes me happy.

08:27.256 --> 08:31.719
And I know that Berto is the love
of your life. [chuckles] I get that.

08:32.845 --> 08:33.846
But...

08:36.933 --> 08:40.436
I think you might be the love of mine.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.982
I hope that's okay with you.

08:47.860 --> 08:48.986
Oh, drat.

08:52.281 --> 08:56.160
I've... Yeah, yeah. Messed up a nail.
Uh... [exhales]

08:56.244 --> 08:59.622
Alex is gonna kill me.
We'll just hide this.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.875
-[sighs]
-[door opens]

09:02.959 --> 09:05.336
I made it halfway to the restaurant.
I forgot my purse.

09:05.419 --> 09:06.671
[gasps]

09:06.754 --> 09:08.214
What? Her vitals are fine.

09:08.297 --> 09:10.216
-She's not wearing earrings!
-[gasps]

09:12.385 --> 09:13.970
Out of the way. Stat!

09:14.679 --> 09:16.681
[sighs] Thank God she didn't wake up.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.224
Isn't that what we want?

09:20.059 --> 09:22.395
[inhales] She must never know.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.359
I was talking to the head nurse.

09:28.442 --> 09:31.237
She gave me all these treats
after I gave her this treat.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.366
Two could play at that game.

09:39.203 --> 09:40.580
I'll just give her money.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.457
[sighs]

09:43.541 --> 09:44.959
Elena, want some Jell-O?

09:45.042 --> 09:47.420
Jell-O is made from boiled down
cow carcass.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.213
Ooh. More for me.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.302
Let's go eat this in the hallway.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.393
[sighs]

10:03.144 --> 10:04.186
I'm no expert,

10:04.270 --> 10:06.897
uh, but I think we have
another beauty emergency.

10:09.358 --> 10:10.526
[sighs]

10:12.361 --> 10:15.615
Abuelita,  I'm putting lipstick on you,

10:15.698 --> 10:18.576
so you might wanna wake up and see this.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.043
Mejor.

10:33.257 --> 10:36.344
[sighs] Did I ever tell you
why I stopped speaking Spanish?

10:39.096 --> 10:41.474
One day, uh, you sent me to school

10:41.557 --> 10:44.769
in a puffy yellow dress
with a big red bow in my hair.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.229
I looked like Ms. Pac-Man.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.861
And so, at lunch, uh,

10:53.944 --> 10:57.281
I "accidentally" flushed
that bow down the toilet.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.283
Took two flushes to get it down.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.205
When I got home, you were so mad.

11:04.288 --> 11:07.291
And you started going off on me
in Spanish, and I...

11:09.293 --> 11:11.212
I just didn't hear you. [sighs]

11:12.254 --> 11:14.423
I mean, I heard you,
I just didn't want to hear you.

11:15.299 --> 11:19.178
[sighs] So, instead of answering back
in Spanish, I just looked at you like...

11:23.140 --> 11:24.975
And you started yelling at Mom.

11:25.643 --> 11:28.270
[imitates Lydia] "Your daughter
cannot speak Spanish anymore.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.439
She has lost her  Cubanidad."

11:32.650 --> 11:34.026
[chuckles softly]

11:36.654 --> 11:38.239
So I had an out.

11:39.323 --> 11:43.536
I pretend I can't speak Spanish,
you ain't great at English.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.747
It was perfect.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.090
Except I screwed myself

11:57.633 --> 12:00.094
because I lost my Spanish.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.097
[sniffles]

12:03.180 --> 12:05.057
I lost my connection to you.

12:07.476 --> 12:08.811
[sighs]

12:10.813 --> 12:15.109
And then last year came
and I was so worried to come out to you.

12:16.277 --> 12:20.114
[sniffles] And you surprised me
with your acceptance

12:20.197 --> 12:22.783
and your love and your support.
[chuckles softly]

12:22.867 --> 12:25.035
You even helped me get a girlfriend.

12:26.328 --> 12:29.665
I know men love you,
but you could crush it as a lesbian.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.959
[chuckles softly]

12:37.715 --> 12:39.300
So now I feel stupid

12:43.762 --> 12:46.015
because all I wanna do is talk to you.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.893
You're exactly who you are

12:48.976 --> 12:51.395
and you don't care
if anyone gets it or not.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.564
And you're loud and opinionated.

12:53.647 --> 12:56.150
You always think you're right.
You are so stubborn.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.903
Oh, my God. Am I you? [gasps]

13:05.075 --> 13:06.535
I should be so lucky.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.498
[sniffles]

13:10.581 --> 13:12.166
Because you're my hero.

13:14.502 --> 13:15.920
Y te quiero.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.298
[Wally crying]

13:26.347 --> 13:27.515
I'm sorry.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.724
[sniffling]

13:28.807 --> 13:31.727
I kept trying to leave
and then something emotional would happen.

13:31.810 --> 13:35.105
And then something even more emotional
would happen.

13:35.189 --> 13:37.483
You guys are very emotional people.

13:38.984 --> 13:42.613
In Pittsburgh, it's,
"Steel Town, Steel Hearts."

13:42.696 --> 13:44.365
[crying]

13:44.448 --> 13:45.783
Oh, God.

13:45.866 --> 13:47.952
What the hell is going on in here?

13:48.702 --> 13:50.704
-Wally's got a lot of stuff.
-[exhales]

13:51.789 --> 13:53.165
That felt good.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.502
I haven't cried since I was six
and my rabbit Tupac died.

13:57.962 --> 14:01.006
For years,
all those tabloid headlines saying

14:01.090 --> 14:04.843
Tupac was alive
just toyed with my emotions.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.932
I brought some stuff
to make it homier for her.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.475
I'm gonna need ten minutes.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.769
Oh, yeah, I should probably go anyway.

14:13.852 --> 14:17.648
The guy in 404 has been waiting, like,
an hour for a sponge bath.

14:18.482 --> 14:20.276
He must be freezing. [crying]

14:33.789 --> 14:34.707
Wow.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.836
You would hate this lighting.

14:42.464 --> 14:43.924
[sighs]

14:50.014 --> 14:52.892
Sorry you missed the citizenship ceremony.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.436
We'll go together
when you're back on your feet.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.731
It's so crazy how we're both immigrants.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.359
I mean, I would never compare
my story to yours,

15:02.443 --> 15:04.528
but the parallels are spooky.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.657
You were 18, I was 18.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.160
You left your family behind.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.704
I left four step-families, a maid,
a butler, a chauffeur,

15:13.787 --> 15:16.040
and a horse groomer who really got me.

15:20.961 --> 15:26.175
[sighs] But Father was expanding
his business to the US and so I had to go.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.678
I remember, at the airport,

15:31.680 --> 15:32.806
I was crying.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.854
But Father put his arm around me
and he said,

15:39.438 --> 15:42.858
"Son, [clears throat] only losers cry."

15:46.362 --> 15:47.905
So that was a long flight.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.493
You don't know how dirty
a dirty look can get

15:52.576 --> 15:55.955
until you're crying for a whole plane ride
and you're not a baby.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.834
[chuckles softly]
I really didn't wanna be in America.

16:04.672 --> 16:05.756
So I drank.

16:07.341 --> 16:10.010
And I recreated the snowy plains
of Canada

16:10.094 --> 16:11.345
with cocaine.

16:14.556 --> 16:15.474
[sighs]

16:15.557 --> 16:19.228
I'm told I attended classes
at Pepperdine University,

16:19.311 --> 16:21.647
but I will have to take that on faith.

16:28.278 --> 16:31.699
So, I'm in a detox center in El Segundo.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.994
This was my fourth rehab.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.247
My re-re-re-rehab.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.292
I thought I'd been doing a kickass job

16:42.376 --> 16:45.170
keeping my drug stuff a secret
from all the tenants and then...

16:47.881 --> 16:50.259
you showed up in my room at that clinic.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.680
You brought me  sopa de pollo

16:55.514 --> 16:59.601
and said it's Cuban penicillin. [chuckles]

17:01.854 --> 17:04.023
You told me, "You eat this,

17:05.691 --> 17:07.026
you get some sleep,

17:12.322 --> 17:15.367
and tomorrow, you try again."

17:20.414 --> 17:24.334
And then you tucked me in
and kissed me good night on my forehead.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.966
Forehead kisses are wildly underrated.

17:34.344 --> 17:36.847
Just something
really comforting about 'em.

17:43.854 --> 17:45.564
Then again, it might just be you.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.402
Dad never did that.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.405
Or my horse groomer.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.622
After I got out of rehab,

18:01.705 --> 18:05.000
I started hanging around
your apartment a lot more, 'cause...

18:07.503 --> 18:08.712
it helped.

18:10.631 --> 18:14.510
Back then, it must have felt like
you had this annoying, intrusive guy over.

18:14.885 --> 18:15.969
Not like now.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.264
'Cause now...

18:23.602 --> 18:24.853
you're my family.

18:38.325 --> 18:42.079
Don't worry. I haven't legally changed
my last name to Alvarez.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.082
My lawyer said it was a whole thing, so...

18:48.168 --> 18:52.589
Anyway, Pen said no crying,
so I'm not gonna. [sniffs]

18:53.132 --> 18:55.509
Actually, for once, I agree with Father.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.971
Only losers cry.

19:02.349 --> 19:03.892
And we're not losing anybody today.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.026
Let's hit that oath ceremony soon, okay?

19:23.078 --> 19:24.580
Whoa.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.167
Too much?

19:28.250 --> 19:29.251
Oh, definitely.

19:31.336 --> 19:35.507
Pretty sure it's a fire hazard.
But it's beautiful.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.844
[knock at door]

19:39.845 --> 19:40.929
Hola.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.140
Okay, I'm gonna stay cool,

19:43.223 --> 19:45.434
but there's definitely
an exorcist guy in here.

19:49.855 --> 19:53.066
Hi,  Padre.
He's just here to do last rites.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.776
Yeah, no. I gotta go.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.238
[Schneider sighs]

20:08.415 --> 20:12.628
Look, I'm just having you do this
because God forbid something happens

20:12.711 --> 20:15.631
and she doesn't get into heaven
on a technicality.

20:16.340 --> 20:20.177
I understand.
If you'd like to join me, please.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.307
Thank you.

20:26.141 --> 20:31.230
Lydia, through this holy anointing,
may the Lord in his love and mercy

20:31.813 --> 20:34.024
help you with the grace
of the Holy Spirit.

20:35.359 --> 20:40.781
May the Lord who frees you from sin
save you and raise you up.

20:40.864 --> 20:41.865
Amen.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.953
Wait. There is one more thing.

20:46.662 --> 20:47.704
Vicks VapoRub.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.127
I blessed it.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.340
Religion and science
can live side by side.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.469
Gracias, Padre.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.979
Well, you must love this.

21:13.355 --> 21:16.525
All these people coming in here,
telling you how much they love you.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.361
I mean, Schneider basically
made you a stage.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.575
You are the star of your coma,  Mami.

21:27.786 --> 21:31.456
But let me tell you something,  viejita,
I'm not part of this.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.626
You're not getting
a tearful bedside speech from me

21:34.710 --> 21:36.837
because I'm still mad
about our fight last night.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.968
I know you like to have the last word,
but this is dramatic, even for you.

21:46.888 --> 21:50.225
You can't have a stroke
to win an argument,  Mami.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.226
It's not fair.

21:55.522 --> 21:56.898
I mean, yeah,

21:59.234 --> 22:02.988
I said some unkind things. [sighs]

22:03.071 --> 22:05.407
But you were being so you.

22:08.535 --> 22:09.703
Then when you told me

22:09.786 --> 22:12.539
I was making a mistake
breaking up with Max,

22:16.293 --> 22:20.839
I remembered another time you told me
I was making a mistake.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.885
It's when I enlisted in the army.
You remember that?

22:26.553 --> 22:29.014
[chuckles softly]
We have had a lot of arguments,

22:29.097 --> 22:31.641
but that one
is definitely in the top three.

22:32.851 --> 22:37.522
Right after, "Don't get divorced,"
and, "Brown lipstick is for hoochies."

22:41.318 --> 22:44.029
Here is the most patriotic woman I know.

22:44.112 --> 22:49.034
A woman who, every Fourth of July,
makes us sing the national anthem

22:49.117 --> 22:51.453
while eating red, white, and blue flan.

22:57.459 --> 23:03.381
Then, on my first day of basic training,
Papi  drove me to the airport alone,

23:04.466 --> 23:06.426
while you stayed home, pouting.

23:11.014 --> 23:13.016
[voice breaking]
You didn't even say goodbye to me.

23:18.688 --> 23:21.817
I never brought it up because
whatever, man, life goes on.

23:22.943 --> 23:27.239
But I was leaving for boot camp,
I was 18 and I was scared

23:27.572 --> 23:29.032
and you weren't there for me.

23:30.158 --> 23:32.119
You know what pissed me off
even more?

23:32.869 --> 23:36.748
Knowing your story
about how, when you left Cuba,

23:36.832 --> 23:40.710
how your  mami  held your hand
the whole car ride to the airport.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.629
Kissed your forehead,

23:42.712 --> 23:45.674
and sang "Cielito Lindo"
so you wouldn't feel afraid.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.426
How you felt so loved.

23:52.430 --> 23:54.766
Thank God that  Papi  was there for me,

23:56.017 --> 23:57.435
because you weren't.

24:00.230 --> 24:03.358
I didn't know if what I was doing
was right or not,

24:03.441 --> 24:06.111
joining the army, but guess what?

24:06.194 --> 24:08.697
It turned out to be very right.

24:09.739 --> 24:13.577
Because I met Victor
and I had those great kids.

24:13.660 --> 24:17.497
And because I served,
I get to go to school and live my dream.

24:17.581 --> 24:21.376
So look at that. Not a mistake after all.

24:21.918 --> 24:24.671
Kind of the best decision I ever made
in my freaking life.

24:24.754 --> 24:26.715
And I did it without your blessing.

24:27.382 --> 24:30.302
So I guess I didn't need
your support then,

24:31.052 --> 24:33.054
and maybe I don't need it now.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.349
[crying]

24:41.855 --> 24:46.193
Mami,  please, wake up and argue with me.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.112
Please,  Mami.

24:53.575 --> 24:56.745
I'm not ready. Not yet.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.456
[sighs]

24:59.539 --> 25:03.418
I'm not gonna say goodbye.
You hear me,  Mami?

25:05.587 --> 25:12.010
Because I understand now why you didn't
say goodbye to me when I went to the army.

25:12.093 --> 25:14.721
Because you were scared
I wasn't coming back.

25:18.266 --> 25:20.060
And I forgive you...

25:22.062 --> 25:24.189
because now I'm afraid.

25:25.523 --> 25:27.651
And I'm not gonna say goodbye.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.949
But instead, what I'm gonna say is this.

25:41.164 --> 25:43.708
You did a really good job being my  mami.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.965
And because of that, we're gonna be okay.

25:52.342 --> 25:53.677
I love you so much.

26:03.770 --> 26:05.730
But if you need to go, it's okay.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.150
It's okay.

I am here to pick you up.

27:21.598 --> 27:24.851
[gasps]  Ay,  Berto.

27:30.690 --> 27:33.401
-You really kept me waiting,  mujer.
-[chuckles softly]

If I didn't know any better,

27:45.080 --> 27:48.708
I'd say you did this
to remain a Cuban citizen until the end.

27:48.792 --> 27:51.711
[chuckles softly]
Are you suggesting that I am being...

27:52.587 --> 27:54.923

28:02.430 --> 28:04.683
And I am not the only one.

28:05.183 --> 28:09.187
-Tell me about this Dr. Berkowitz.
-[scoffs]

28:09.270 --> 28:13.108
Berto, he's just a friend.
But I like that you are jealous.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.652
I am jealous,  amor.

28:15.735 --> 28:19.239
But I cannot blame this man
for having excellent taste.

28:19.322 --> 28:22.075
-[chuckles]
-Ay, mírala.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.829
When she's sleeping, she still looks 12.

28:25.912 --> 28:28.957
[chuckles] Yeah, but I'm still mad at her.

28:29.707 --> 28:30.875
Ay, mi vida,  why?

28:30.959 --> 28:33.920
Because she had a good man
and she let him go.

28:34.003 --> 28:38.133
All about whether or not to have a baby.
The greatest gift.

28:38.216 --> 28:40.427
And we make such good-looking ones.

28:40.510 --> 28:42.470
[chuckles] It's true.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.181
Lupe said she was too old,

28:45.265 --> 28:48.810
but I would have had a baby
with you at any age.

28:48.893 --> 28:51.187
-Hmm.
-Fifty. Sixty.

28:51.896 --> 28:54.107
We could make a baby right now.

28:59.112 --> 29:00.697
Don't tempt me.

29:02.657 --> 29:07.537
Actually, if I remember correctly,
I wanted to have many more babies,

29:08.455 --> 29:10.248
but you wanted to go back to dancing.

29:11.291 --> 29:15.295
Oh, right. Don't tell her.

29:15.378 --> 29:16.796
[chuckles]

29:18.047 --> 29:19.632
Ay, Dios mío.

29:20.508 --> 29:23.970
You have lived one hell of a life.

29:24.053 --> 29:25.472
That's true.

29:25.555 --> 29:29.768
And I managed to be glamorous to the end.
I knew I could do it!

29:29.851 --> 29:31.478

29:32.228 --> 29:35.690
-Fue maravilloso.
-Mmm.

graduating from high school,

29:40.945 --> 29:46.242
then college, then graduate school,
then a doctorate.

29:46.993 --> 29:49.120
I just wish I could be there to say,

29:49.204 --> 29:51.748
"You can't go to school forever.
Get a job."

29:56.419 --> 30:00.965
And then there is  Papito.
Ay, Dios mío, ese niño.

30:01.716 --> 30:04.010
[sighs] He just gets me.

30:04.093 --> 30:05.845
You are my soul mate, but he...

30:08.681 --> 30:10.308
is my other half.

30:12.143 --> 30:14.938
I will miss him getting married.

30:16.105 --> 30:19.359
I would have looked so good
on top of that wedding cake.

What's the matter? Are you worried
she won't be okay without you?

30:32.872 --> 30:34.541
No, no. That's just it.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.127
Obviously, she will be devastated

30:38.211 --> 30:41.464
and her bereavement will be
written about in the history books.

30:44.467 --> 30:45.718
She's gonna fine.

30:46.845 --> 30:50.473
Our daughter is magnificent.

30:51.516 --> 30:55.603
She is a spectacular mother and woman

30:56.187 --> 31:00.483
and nurse and fighter and healer.

31:03.111 --> 31:07.740
Our daughter heals people, Berto.
