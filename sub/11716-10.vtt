I am so happy
you are letting me
do this.

00:06.924 --> 00:08.216
Oh, come on.
You painting
a mural for the baby

00:08.342 --> 00:10.845
is such a sweet gift.

00:10.970 --> 00:13.430
All Jeff wanted to do
was put up some
Pearl Jam posters.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.642
Well, Jen
is an amazing artist.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.311
She was the face painter
at her nephew's
fifth birthday party,

00:19.436 --> 00:22.564
and she painted me
a Bengal tiger.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.232
It scared the crap
out of that one kid, huh?

00:24.358 --> 00:26.360
(MIMICS GROWLING)

00:26.485 --> 00:27.820
JEFF: I'm home.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.530
I'm in the baby's room.

00:29.655 --> 00:33.492
JEFF: Is there any chance
I'm gonna get some tonight?

00:33.617 --> 00:35.703
The answer
will determine
my scotch intake.

00:38.372 --> 00:42.209
Is this an intervention?

00:42.334 --> 00:45.880
No, but we should
probably squeeze one in
before the baby comes.

00:46.005 --> 00:48.757
No, Jen offered
to paint a mural on the wall
as a gift for the baby.

00:48.883 --> 00:52.177
Oh, great, now I don't have
to spend any more money
decorating this room.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.388
I am gonna go
pick up some dinner
for us, our treat.

00:54.513 --> 00:56.097
And the universe
corrects itself.

00:58.517 --> 01:01.228
So, Jeff,
you got any big plans
for this Saturday night?

01:01.979 --> 01:02.813
(HUFFS)

01:04.023 --> 01:04.982
What's the right answer?

01:05.106 --> 01:05.941
Uh, no.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.069
Sure, you don't.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.445
(GIGGLES)

01:13.699 --> 01:15.409
Okay, buddy.

You play it your way.

My way is walking away
from you right now.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.675
Oh, what's with
the giggling,
Anderson Cooper?

01:33.092 --> 01:36.221
Okay, I'm not sure
who that is,

01:36.346 --> 01:39.224
but Jeff and the guys
are planning to throw me

01:39.349 --> 01:40.809
a surprise
bachelor party Saturday.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.310
How do you know?

01:42.436 --> 01:44.521
Well, I've been
dropping some hint bombs.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.274
And I overheard
Jeff and Russell

01:47.399 --> 01:49.109
whispering something
about Saturday night.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.195
Plus, this morning,
Jeff was by the elevator,

01:52.320 --> 01:53.948
and he saw me coming,
and he went up the stairs.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.201
Well, that all adds up.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.037
(SIGHS)

02:00.161 --> 02:01.580
I just don't want you
to be disappointed

02:01.705 --> 02:03.331
if they didn't end up
planning anything.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.126
Listen, honey, I know
the guys like to tease me

02:06.251 --> 02:07.962
and draw things
on my face
when I'm sleeping,

02:09.671 --> 02:11.966
but they're not gonna
pass up a bachelor party.

02:12.091 --> 02:13.133
You know, I mean,
it'll give them a chance

02:13.258 --> 02:14.426
to see me
act like an idiot.

02:16.428 --> 02:17.554
A rare treat.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.890
(CHUCKLES)
I know.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.142
(GASPS)
Oh, my God.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.436
Oh, my God,
do you think
they'll kidnap me?

02:24.561 --> 02:25.228
I hope they do,
I've always wanted
to be kidnapped.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.443
All right, I am going
to start painting.
I'll see you at home.

02:31.568 --> 02:32.569
Mmm-hmm.
Bye.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.991
(SIGHS)

02:37.116 --> 02:39.785
I guess I won't
be seeing you
anytime soon, hmm?

02:41.578 --> 02:43.122
Especially this
Saturday night.

(GIGGLES)

What is he, high?

02:55.258 --> 02:57.260
No.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.804
Maybe.
I don't know anymore.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.556
I... (SIGHS)

03:01.682 --> 03:02.724
What are you
planning for him?

03:03.809 --> 03:05.310
When he nods off later,

03:05.435 --> 03:07.146
I was gonna draw
a wang on his face.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.150
You can drop the act.
He knows.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.359
And I don't care
where you take him.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.902
Just don't
leave him alone.

03:14.028 --> 03:14.486
You know
how he wanders off.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.158
Look, I'm not
married to you,

03:19.282 --> 03:20.784
so I'm not required
to figure out
what you're talking about.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.874
Adam overheard
you and Russell
making plans

03:26.999 --> 03:28.207
for his bachelor
party Saturday night.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.044
No.

03:30.169 --> 03:32.504
He heard us making plans
to go to a movie without him.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.548
Why?

03:34.673 --> 03:36.884
Aw, you've seen
a movie with him!

"What are they doing?"

03:41.930 --> 03:43.390
"Do you think
they're really doing it?"

03:44.850 --> 03:46.393
I get it,

03:46.518 --> 03:48.687
but he is absolutely sure

03:48.812 --> 03:50.731
that you guys
are planning a surprise
bachelor party for him.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.482
Well, we're not, so...

to say I love you?

to say that I'm not scared?

♪ With you by my side

Okay, here's what's happening,
you thoughtless turds.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.773
You are throwing Adam
a surprise bachelor party.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.234
He is expecting it,

04:35.358 --> 04:36.944
and I do not want him
to be disappointed
before the wedding.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.737
That's smart.
Save it for after.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.074
Zip it,
you albino smurf.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.119
Now, listen.

04:45.244 --> 04:47.955
For some reason,
Adam idolizes you guys,

04:48.080 --> 04:49.372
even though
you treat him like crap.

04:49.497 --> 04:50.874
I mean, did it
ever occur to you

04:50.999 --> 04:53.001
to even throw him
a bachelor party?

04:53.127 --> 04:54.253
To be honest,
I thought you guys
were already married.

04:56.255 --> 04:57.631
I didn't believe
you were ever gonna do it.

04:57.756 --> 04:58.799
I mean, you've been
engaged forever.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.008
Yeah.
TIMMY: Yes.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.136
As they say
in my country,

05:02.261 --> 05:04.012
"Go number two,
or get off the loo."

05:06.181 --> 05:07.766
Well, we are
getting married,

05:07.891 --> 05:09.434
and you are surprising him
with a bachelor party.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.852
Here are your itineraries.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.646
Come on.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.190
Vegas, cocktails, cigars.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.691

anything I hate.

Yep, a little gambling,
steak dinner.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.280
Jennifer, there's a...
(CHUCKLES)

05:21.404 --> 05:22.906
May be a misprint.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.159
There's no mention
of any entertainment.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.122
Do we understand
each other?

05:30.956 --> 05:32.791
You wanna see boobies?

05:32.916 --> 05:34.960
Well, if you're offering.
Take five, guys.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.546
Well, Ms. Morgan
has charged me

05:38.672 --> 05:40.339
with finding strippers
who are, and I quote,

05:40.465 --> 05:42.050
"Just this
side of nasty."

05:43.551 --> 05:45.804
We'll stay on this side.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.139
BOTH: We're gonna go
to the other side.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.604
Hey.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.606
Ready for
your guy's weekend?

05:56.731 --> 05:58.150
Oh, as soon as Russell
and his manservant get here.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.237
You guys,
I'm all done
with the mural.

06:02.361 --> 06:03.571
Come take a look.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.075
It's beautiful!
I love it.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.703
Oh, I am so glad.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.164
And since you're
having a girl, I worked
in some extra pink.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.208
What do you think, Jeff?

06:14.333 --> 06:17.836
It's the best mural
in the apartment.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.047
I'm so happy
I could do this
for you guys.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.715
All right,
I'm gonna go home

06:21.840 --> 06:22.632
and make sure
Adam's ready
for his surprise.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.176
Thanks again.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.969
So, what do you
really think?

06:26.094 --> 06:28.596
I like it.
Oh, why?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.265
What silly thing
are you gonna
complain about?

06:30.389 --> 06:33.227
Nothing,
other than it looks
like a giant penis.

06:33.352 --> 06:36.188
What?
That's crazy.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.190
Well, sure,
I could see, given
your frame of reference,

06:38.315 --> 06:39.566
that you wouldn't
think this was giant,

06:41.318 --> 06:42.485
but that's a wiener.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.905
Okay.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.573
Jeff, that does not
look like that, okay?

06:46.698 --> 06:48.700
That is an adorable
giraffe, okay?

06:48.825 --> 06:50.660
It has a long,
pink neck.

06:50.785 --> 06:51.912
Oh, my God.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.332
There you go.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.586
No, come on
we're overreacting.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.088
Nobody else
is even gonna see.

07:01.213 --> 07:02.589
What's with
the monster rod?

07:04.716 --> 07:06.093
Well, of course
Russell sees it.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.094
He's a
disgusting pervert.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.221
Hey, come on, now.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.222
Well, that's fair.
Yeah.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.973

07:12.099 --> 07:13.683
What do you think,
Timmy?

07:13.808 --> 07:15.602
There is something
vaguely phallic about it.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.396
(CHUCKLES)
You're gay!

07:19.480 --> 07:22.067
Sir, you just said
the exact same thing
yourself.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.860
Yeah,
but my tongue didn't
roll out of my head

07:23.985 --> 07:26.405
like a cartoon coyote
when I said it.

07:26.529 --> 07:27.906
Look, when I go
over to get Adam,

07:28.031 --> 07:29.366
I'm just gonna tell Jen
she has to paint over this.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.743
No, you can't do that.
You'll hurt her feelings.

07:31.868 --> 07:32.702
Look, I'll handle it.

07:32.827 --> 07:33.995
Poorly.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.830
What does that mean?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.498
It means
that you will fail

07:37.624 --> 07:38.499
at what
you're trying to accomplish.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.212
I will not.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.339
I can fix this
without making
her feel bad.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.840
No, you can't.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.926
You're not good
at things like this.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.720
I'm great
at things like this!

07:50.845 --> 07:52.222
This seems
like a private
conversation.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.765
We should go.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.310
Right.
Hey, did you hear that?

07:56.435 --> 07:59.146
Timmy wants us to leave
so he can be alone
with the penis mural.

08:03.524 --> 08:05.110
This is exciting.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.279
I have no experience
kidnapping anyone.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.531
I assume you do.

08:10.657 --> 08:14.161
Well, a little
"He said, she said," yeah.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.745
All right, let's do this.
TIMMY: All right.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.414
You guys ready?
Mmm-hmm.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.040
This is scary.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.125
Shh.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.502
Go, go, go.
Oh!

BOTH: Oh!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

It's me, you idiots!

08:25.922 --> 08:27.090
Oh, my God,
it's Jen!

(GRUNTS)

08:29.092 --> 08:31.011
You didn't know?

08:31.136 --> 08:32.846
What, so you thought
you were grabbing
Adam's boob?

08:37.558 --> 08:40.061
Wow.
My goodness!

08:40.187 --> 08:42.605
What in the world
could the three of you
possibly be doing here?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.985
We're here
to take you to your
surprise bachelor party.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.321
Bachelor party?

08:49.446 --> 08:51.823
Oh, my God!
I am so surprised.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.953
Well, it took
a lot of planning,
but we did it.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.330
You guys are the best.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.874
We really are, yeah.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.125
Ready to go?
Almost.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.002
Jen?

09:09.424 --> 09:11.134
All right.
It is on!

09:13.845 --> 09:15.847
Oh, you know what?
I should probably go
to the bathroom before we go.

09:15.972 --> 09:16.515
Who wants to take me?

09:23.980 --> 09:25.690
Aw, do they pipe in
the pee smell?

09:27.608 --> 09:30.445
It's actually
made fresh daily.

09:30.570 --> 09:34.324
Hmm, there's a gentleman
serving up a new batch
as we speak.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.535
Sweet, dude. We're in
the conductor's car.

09:37.452 --> 09:38.661
Hi.

09:38.786 --> 09:39.871
You're doing a great job.

09:40.539 --> 09:41.664
Gee, thanks.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.793
Anyway, guys,
I am so excited
for Vegas, huh?

09:45.919 --> 09:47.546
Yo!
Yeah!

09:47.670 --> 09:49.089
Yes, it's gonna be
the best bachelor party ever.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.673
(TRAIN SCREECHES)

09:53.385 --> 09:56.137
ADAM: Did you guys
put the pillowcase
over my head again?

09:56.263 --> 09:57.389
(GIGGLES)

10:00.392 --> 10:02.394
So, Jeff and I
were admiring your mural,

10:02.519 --> 10:04.312
which we love,
by the way,

10:04.438 --> 10:06.814
but we noticed something
about the giraffe.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.233
Princess Winky.

10:10.651 --> 10:13.280
"Princess" Winky?
That's... Huh.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.574
I always just thought
it was a boy giraffe.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.868
Why?

10:18.993 --> 10:21.996
Oh, I don't know.
There's just something
distinctly male about it.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.875
Is that a problem?
Is there
something wrong?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.877
No, no, no.
Sweetie, no, no, no!

10:28.002 --> 10:29.796
We just thought
maybe Princess Winky
looked a little lonely.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.048
Oh!

10:32.173 --> 10:33.383
You mean, like,
fill in the space?

10:33.508 --> 10:35.176
Yeah! Yeah.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.304
Give the eye
some other things
to look at.

10:39.764 --> 10:42.058
Oh, I could create
a whole jungle world.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.643
Sure, yeah!
Add as much
as you want. Go nuts.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.145
(SIGHS)
No, not nuts.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.024
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

10:50.150 --> 10:51.859
Ah.

10:51.985 --> 10:55.113
Well, nothing
got more attractive
while it was dark.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.907
MAN ON ANNOUNCER:
Attention, passengers,
I have an update for you.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.327
The train that's stopped
on the tracks ahead of us
is still stopped.

11:00.452 --> 11:03.371
That's not really an update.
It's just the same thing.

11:03.497 --> 11:06.458
I'll keep you posted
as I get more information.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.502
Yes, do you have
any more information?

11:10.337 --> 11:11.296
I just said
that I didn't.

11:12.671 --> 11:14.466
Well, that was
to everyone.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.510
I thought maybe
between you and me.

11:16.635 --> 11:18.219
You know what?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.263
Why don't you just
go sit down and
blame me for everything

11:20.388 --> 11:21.806
like the rest of
the subterranean cretins?

11:23.850 --> 11:24.767
Sir, I could
never blame you.

11:26.853 --> 11:27.521
You're a train man.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.651
All right.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.653
Just had a confab
with the conduc.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.946
He's gonna give me
an update once
he's got more information.

11:37.071 --> 11:39.115
Well, I hope
we get moving soon.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.450
We do have
a flight to catch.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.827
Oh, don't worry, Timmy.
We're gonna make it!

11:42.952 --> 11:45.997
This is all part
of the epic
bachelor party story.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.874
What about
the epic B.O. down here?
Is that part of the story?

11:48.958 --> 11:50.960
Great idea
taking the train, Tim.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.505
It wasn't his idea.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.882
Oh, that's right.
This is all Jen's doing.

11:57.551 --> 12:00.261
Jen?
What did Jen do?

12:00.387 --> 12:03.097
Nothing.
Don't listen to them.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.724
Jen forced us into
this whole stupid thing.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.686
If we die down here,
I'm gonna haunt her so hard.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.980
Wait.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.731
Jen made you guys have
a bachelor party for me?

12:14.526 --> 12:15.652
You had nothing
planned for tonight?

12:15.776 --> 12:18.112
No, no.
We did, we did.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.864
You and I were gonna
go to a movie, right?

12:21.324 --> 12:23.410
Okay, look,
so it was Jen's idea,

12:23.535 --> 12:26.329
but we're happy
to go gamble, and drink,

12:26.454 --> 12:28.122
and look
at naked ladies,

12:28.248 --> 12:29.040
and we don't mind
at all that you're here.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.586
I can't believe this.

12:32.711 --> 12:33.461
I thought you guys
were my friends.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.382
Seriously, is there
a wet goat down here?

12:39.676 --> 12:41.344
You know what?

12:41.469 --> 12:44.055
Forget it.
I'm not going to Vegas.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.182
Well, I don't think
any of us are going
to Vegas now.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.934
I'm just gonna go find
another place to sit.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.477
Oh.
Mr. Rhodes.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.812
No, look, I don't need
you guys for anything.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.320
Pull it
like the sign says.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.867
Thanks.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.120
Now, I don't need
you guys for anything.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.294
I feel terrible
about Mr. Rhodes.

13:14.419 --> 13:15.962
But what's the big deal?
We rip on him all the time.

13:16.087 --> 13:17.505
That's what
he's here for.

13:17.631 --> 13:18.965
No, I get
what Timmy's saying.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.634
A bachelor party
is an important guy thing.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.595
It's like a funeral
for the fun part
of your life.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.555
And think of this

13:25.680 --> 13:27.724
Mr. Rhodes actually
values your friendship.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.559
Who else
can you say that about?

13:33.438 --> 13:34.397
No.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.573
I lull myself to sleep nightly
plotting your death.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.368
MAN OVER ANNOUNCER:
Bad news, folks.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.955
It looks like we are not
going to be moving
for at least one hour.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.457
An hour?
(PEOPLE GROANING)

13:52.582 --> 13:54.000
Yeah,
'cause it's my fault.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.671
Well, that's it.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.633
We're not making it
to Las Vegas tonight.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.051
You know what?
We'll just make it up
to him next year.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.221
It's not his birthday.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.975
It's his bachelor party,
and I say we give him one
right here, right now.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.686
That's a great idea.

14:12.811 --> 14:15.938
Quick question.
Won't that suck?

14:16.063 --> 14:18.775
Maybe, but we owe it
to the little goofball
to at least try.

14:18.899 --> 14:20.318
I'll deny this
to his face,

14:20.443 --> 14:22.320
but Adam's a good friend.

14:22.445 --> 14:23.571
We should
do this for him.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.198
I'm in.

14:25.323 --> 14:28.368
I'm in too, mostly just
to stir up the air in here.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.745
Yeah, now we gotta
get all the ingredients
for a good bachelor party.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.872
I can find
booze anywhere.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.082
That's great,
I can sniff out a girl
with daddy issues anywhere.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.169
Timmy,
you're our tech guy.

14:39.546 --> 14:40.880
Why am I the tech guy?

14:41.005 --> 14:41.840
Look at yourself.

14:45.802 --> 14:46.803
Yeah, okay.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.682
Hands in.
"Bachelor party"
on three.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.266
ALL: One, two, three.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.768
Bachelor party!

14:53.893 --> 14:55.269
(CHUCKLES)
He said it!

14:57.397 --> 14:58.648
See, that's why
you're our tech guy.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.900
Let's do this.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.949
And then, it turns out
my fiancee made them
do the whole thing.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.869
And, I mean, she did it
because she loves me,

15:10.993 --> 15:12.871
and she's totally hot,
you know,

15:12.995 --> 15:14.581
but I just wanted my boys
to be into it, you know?

15:16.416 --> 15:17.751
Isn't that the worst?

15:17.876 --> 15:19.377
Yeah.
Sucks to be you, buddy.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.590
Thanks. I appreciate that.
Hey, I like you, man.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.174
You got a business card
or something?

15:27.009 --> 15:27.844
Mr. Rhodes.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.096
Oh.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.768
Hello, Timothy.

15:34.893 --> 15:37.019
If you're here
to apologize,
you're too late,

15:37.144 --> 15:39.313
'cause, as you can see,
I have a new friend now.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.565
That he does.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.026
Mr. Rhodes,
please come
and rejoin us.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.486
Give them
a second chance.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.617
Thanks. I already had
my hopes up once,

15:50.742 --> 15:52.285
and they let me down.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.370
Look, I've been
on the receiving end

15:54.495 --> 15:57.081
of their barbs
and insensitivity
many a time.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.251
They can be immature
and thoughtless
and often, downright cruel.

16:02.336 --> 16:03.588
You know,
maybe I'll just stay here
with you.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.465
(SIGHS)
Whatever.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.592
You know what? No.
Please come back.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.511
Trust me.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.763
I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.

16:13.264 --> 16:14.223
Okay.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.310
Look, Spencer,
I gotta go.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.481
Look at me here, okay?
This? This right here?

16:21.606 --> 16:23.775
This is real, all right?

16:32.826 --> 16:35.620
All right,
we've got two
bags of chips,

16:35.745 --> 16:38.122
half a sub,
most of a pizza,
a dozen donuts,

16:38.247 --> 16:40.708
and plenty of booze
thanks to my new buddies
over here.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.794
Hey.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.963
Oh, great,
ZZ Top and  Brave's father.

16:46.547 --> 16:49.175
Anyway, it was slim pickings,
but my keen senses

16:49.300 --> 16:51.719
led me to the only
professional dancer
on the train.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.054
Oh, hello!

16:54.180 --> 16:55.765
She's not bad.
I'd watch her
shake her lady parts.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.266
Oh, yeah.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.477
All right, Mr. Rhodes,
you can look now.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.564
Welcome to your
bachelor party, buddy.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.359
We got food.
We got booze.
We got entertainment.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.486
Oh, did someone
say "Light show?"

17:09.278 --> 17:10.905
Tech guy, yeah.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.366
You dragged me
back for this?

17:16.327 --> 17:17.954
Because it's fantastic!

17:18.078 --> 17:19.079
All right!
Oh, my God!

17:19.205 --> 17:20.790
Hey, guys,
thank you.

17:20.915 --> 17:22.542
Really?
Yes, yes!

17:22.667 --> 17:24.502
I mean, you guys
really made an effort for me.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.128
Check this out.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.214
Timmy hooked up
Russell's tunes.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.174
Get ready
to push 'em up.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.886
MALE VOICE:  Welcome to
Being Tall on the Inside,

17:33.011 --> 17:35.221
a motivational book
for short statured men.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.640
No, no, don't...

17:37.765 --> 17:39.893
I know you were trying
not to hurt my feelings,

17:40.018 --> 17:42.061
but I totally
got what you meant.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.521
Oh, I'm so glad.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.356
Open your eyes.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.358
Oh, my God.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.611
(LAUGHS EXCITEDLY)

17:50.737 --> 17:53.155
Uh, what is the monkey
doing to Princess Winky?

17:55.324 --> 17:56.868
(EXCLAIMS)
Riding her!

17:56.993 --> 17:59.161
(GIGGLES)

18:00.705 --> 18:02.122
See how much
he loves his banana?

18:04.834 --> 18:07.127
Yes, yeah, he certainly
has a good grip on it.

18:10.297 --> 18:13.051
What are those
two round things
at the base of the neck?

18:14.844 --> 18:16.721
Coconuts. That's why
they're so hairy.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.892
Of course.

18:21.017 --> 18:24.478
Gosh, I think
this is some
of my best work ever.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.522
I mean,
not to be cocky.

18:26.647 --> 18:27.523
Oh.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.652
You have
every right to be.

18:33.404 --> 18:35.322
Lovely, right down there.
Enjoy.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.325
Please, enjoy yourself.
Whoa.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.660
It's five dollars
for dudes.

18:41.746 --> 18:42.872
It's a sausage tax.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.753
All right, all right,
lover boy,

18:48.878 --> 18:50.463
you found
your queen in life.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.131
Now, you just gotta
find this one, all right?

18:52.256 --> 18:53.007
Keep your eyes on it.
Keep your eyes on it.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.093
Uh-huh. Yeah, uh-huh.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.636
Where you at?
Bam, that one.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.430
Oh!
Oh, man, again?

18:59.555 --> 19:01.766
What, I haven't won once.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.142
Hey, you're not
cheating, are you?

19:03.267 --> 19:04.811
What?
(LAUGHS) Just kidding.

19:04.936 --> 19:06.312
I trust you,
Sleazy Willy.

19:09.231 --> 19:12.986
All right, now, it's time
for the entertainment
portion of the evening!

19:13.111 --> 19:15.195
Let's get
our lucky bachelor up

19:15.321 --> 19:17.490
in the seat of honor.
(ALL CHEERING)

19:17.615 --> 19:21.119
(SHOUTS)
Put 'em down,
put 'em down.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.663
On the main stage, we got...
What's your name again?

19:23.788 --> 19:25.164
Helen.
We got Candy
on the main stage!

19:25.289 --> 19:27.166
(ALL CHEERING)

19:30.962 --> 19:33.172
Wait, wait, wait,
hold up.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.590
What are you doing?
I thought
you were a dancer.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.216
I am.
A tap dancer.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.218
No, uh...

19:38.344 --> 19:40.888
We were looking
for the type of dancing
that involves a pole.

19:41.931 --> 19:42.849
Okay.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.110
You are so talented.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.990
You guys,
best bachelor
party ever!

19:59.115 --> 20:00.700
BOTH: Ever!
(ALL CHEERING)

20:00.825 --> 20:01.909
Whoo!

20:10.918 --> 20:13.004
MAN ON ANNOUNCER:
Excuse me, folks,
I've just gotten the go-ahead

20:13.129 --> 20:14.714
to start back up.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.382
We should be moving
in just a moment.

20:16.507 --> 20:19.343
(ALL GROAN)

20:19.468 --> 20:22.722
Seriously,
I can't win with you people.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.182
Hey, hey, bring it in,
bring it in, bring it in.

20:24.306 --> 20:27.267
Hey, thank you.
Thank you again, guys.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.353
I mean, you really
came through for me.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.271
Hope you
enjoyed your party.
I did.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.815
I did, but there's
only one thing

20:32.940 --> 20:34.108
that could make
this thing better.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.110
Whoo-hoo!

20:37.236 --> 20:38.988
I'm driving the train!

20:39.113 --> 20:40.156
I'm a train man.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.366
Whoo!
Yeah!

20:43.617 --> 20:44.618
Whoo-hoo!

20:47.997 --> 20:49.707
Well, I doubted you,
but I have to admit,

20:49.832 --> 20:50.875
you really
seem to have
taken care of it.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.258
See?
I told you I'd handle it.
