WEBVTT

00:04.132 --> 00:07.017
"Let's get this party started."

00:08.353 --> 00:09.686
Hey, can you
push the button?

00:09.688 --> 00:11.455
Do not touch
that button.

00:11.457 --> 00:13.523
Just give it a little push.
Don't push it.

00:13.525 --> 00:14.808
Just push it a little.
Don't listen to him.

00:14.810 --> 00:16.059
Half of it, halfway, halfway...
Don't even touch it.

00:16.061 --> 00:17.561
Why can't I
push the button?

00:17.563 --> 00:19.596
Because whenever Barney
sees a button-- any button--

00:19.598 --> 00:21.231
as to push it.

00:23.402 --> 00:25.435
Sorry.

00:25.437 --> 00:27.054
Why are you so mad?

00:27.056 --> 00:29.272
Because my rehearsal dinner

00:29.274 --> 00:31.408
was supposed to start
ten minutes ago.

00:31.410 --> 00:33.777
But instead of stuffing my face

00:33.779 --> 00:35.212
with hors d'oeuvres

00:35.214 --> 00:37.330
that I have been dreaming
about for months,

00:37.332 --> 00:39.750
I am in a laser tag

00:39.752 --> 00:41.501
security office,

00:41.503 --> 00:44.921
waiting for the police
to arrest my fiancé

00:44.923 --> 00:46.556
for causing a disturbance.

00:46.558 --> 00:47.758
Hey, you said "fiancé."

00:47.760 --> 00:49.426
That's a good sign.

00:49.428 --> 00:50.894
Now what do you say
we give that old button a push?

00:50.896 --> 00:53.430
Take a good look at
this face, Barney, okay?

00:53.432 --> 00:56.233
'Cause it'll be useful
for the future.

00:56.984 --> 00:58.935
This is my "pretty mad" face.

00:58.937 --> 01:00.737
Well, then, we've got a problem.

01:00.739 --> 01:03.690
'Cause it looks a lot like
your "pretty hungry" face.

01:03.692 --> 01:05.275
I'm missing
the bacon-wrapped figs!

01:05.277 --> 01:07.143
Please push the button!

01:07.168 --> 01:11.168

01:19.924 --> 01:21.792
Why is it
so cold in here?

01:21.794 --> 01:23.510
You trying to get me to talk
or something?

01:23.512 --> 01:24.678
Not really.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.213
In fact, if you could just
sit there quietly...

01:26.215 --> 01:27.714
Fine, I'll talk.

01:27.716 --> 01:29.683
It all started a few months ago,

01:29.685 --> 01:32.936
when I had the most
awesome idea ever.

01:32.938 --> 01:35.722
Laser tag
rehearsal dinner!

01:35.724 --> 01:37.724
That might be the worst idea
you've ever had,

01:37.726 --> 01:38.859
which is saying a lot.

01:38.861 --> 01:41.278
Name one bad idea
I've ever had.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.113
Gluten-free edible panties.

01:43.115 --> 01:44.364
Hot dog on a stick
on a bun.

01:44.366 --> 01:45.966
Inflatable sex toy life raft.

01:45.968 --> 01:47.367
The breast
augmentation channel.

01:47.369 --> 01:49.035
Single malt
Scotch tape.

01:49.037 --> 01:50.070
The time you ran for mayor.

01:50.072 --> 01:51.688
I still have 12,000 buttons
that say,

01:51.690 --> 01:53.790
"The only poll I care about
is in my pants."

01:54.876 --> 01:56.326
Barney, planning
a wedding

01:56.328 --> 01:57.828
is all about compromise.

01:57.830 --> 01:59.129
Do you remember that one night,

01:59.131 --> 02:00.714
right after we got engaged?

02:00.716 --> 02:02.516
Where is this wedding
gonna be, anyway?

02:02.518 --> 02:05.669
You know, I thought
it might be nice

02:05.671 --> 02:07.387
I mean, it's where
I'm from, and...

02:08.339 --> 02:09.489
Okay.

02:09.491 --> 02:11.424
Let's have it.
Get it over with,

02:11.426 --> 02:12.509
get it all out
of your system.

02:12.511 --> 02:13.477
I'm the groom,

02:13.479 --> 02:14.845
I'm the groom,
I might as well start.

02:14.847 --> 02:16.563
Canada?
What, are we gonna

02:16.565 --> 02:18.682
walk down the aisle to
Crash Test Dummies?

02:18.684 --> 02:19.883
Play's to Marshall.

02:19.885 --> 02:21.351
Canada?
What are you gonna do,

02:21.353 --> 02:23.520
hire a regular dog sled
or a stretch?

02:24.071 --> 02:25.021
Canada?

02:25.023 --> 02:26.857
Are you registered
at Tim Hortons?

02:26.859 --> 02:27.774
Canada.

02:27.776 --> 02:29.392
Oh, does
the organist play

02:29.394 --> 02:30.527
wearing mittens?

02:30.529 --> 02:32.028
Canada? How are you gonna

02:32.030 --> 02:33.246
slip the ring on
the bride's finger

02:33.248 --> 02:34.564
if she's wearing
mittens?

02:35.751 --> 02:37.000
Two mitten jokes
in a row?

02:37.002 --> 02:39.286
So... you're pretty
much done, then?

02:39.288 --> 02:41.538
Kids... we weren't even close.

02:41.540 --> 02:42.756
Canada.

02:42.758 --> 02:44.374
What do we ask on
the wedding invitation?

02:44.376 --> 02:47.127
"Will you be having
the elk or the moose?"

02:47.129 --> 02:48.211
Canada.

02:48.213 --> 02:50.096
What, are you gonna
walk down the aisle

02:50.098 --> 02:51.381
wearing snowshoes?!

02:52.384 --> 02:53.767
Canada.

02:53.769 --> 02:55.886
What, is everyone gonna have
access to universal healthcare

02:55.888 --> 02:58.021
so no one has to choose
between going bankrupt

02:58.023 --> 03:00.607
and treating
a life-threatening illness?

03:00.609 --> 03:01.925
Canada?

03:01.927 --> 03:03.793
W-What's the band gonna play
for your first dance?

03:03.795 --> 03:05.245
Crash Test Dummies?

03:05.247 --> 03:06.763
See, it's funny

03:06.765 --> 03:08.164
'cause who gets a band?

03:08.166 --> 03:10.066
Enough.
It was just an idea.

03:10.068 --> 03:11.201
Okay, okay.

03:11.203 --> 03:12.936
Seriously, Robin,
doing it here in New York

03:12.938 --> 03:14.988
would be easier, since
all of our friends

03:14.990 --> 03:16.623
and a lot of
our family are here.

03:16.625 --> 03:20.076
But... I want you to have the wedding
that you want.

03:20.078 --> 03:21.795
So if it's Canada...

03:21.797 --> 03:23.330
just say the word.

03:24.299 --> 03:26.299
And then say it again
in French.

03:27.469 --> 03:29.920
See? I compromised.

03:29.922 --> 03:31.171
Fine.

03:31.173 --> 03:33.790
We'll just have a nice,
tasteful rehearsal dinner.

03:33.792 --> 03:36.593
Maybe at a French restaurant.

03:36.595 --> 03:37.928
I know just the place.

03:37.930 --> 03:39.763
What's the name
of the restaurant?

03:39.765 --> 03:42.933
La... ser tag.

03:43.901 --> 03:45.352
You know, I was thinking about

03:45.354 --> 03:47.136
what to get you guys
for a wedding gift.

03:47.138 --> 03:48.271
As you know,

03:48.273 --> 03:50.407
I'm kind of
the wedding gift master.

03:51.108 --> 03:52.442
And, well,
all this talk

03:52.444 --> 03:53.410
of the rehearsal dinner

03:53.412 --> 03:55.195
gives me a fantastic idea.

03:55.197 --> 03:56.363
I've been
meaning

03:56.365 --> 03:58.665
to start taking
piano lessons again.

03:58.667 --> 03:59.749
No.

03:59.751 --> 04:00.817
No piano time.
Guys!

04:00.819 --> 04:02.002
Just let me perform something.

04:02.004 --> 04:03.453
I'll-I'll tickle the keys.

04:03.455 --> 04:04.421
It'll be great.

04:04.423 --> 04:06.706
Not even if you
dressed up as Liberace.

04:06.708 --> 04:08.174
What if I dressed up
as Liberace?

04:08.176 --> 04:09.158
Sold!
Sold.

04:10.761 --> 04:12.545
And that was the end of it.

04:12.547 --> 04:14.163
Until my bachelor party.

04:14.165 --> 04:15.348
Uh-oh.

04:15.350 --> 04:16.565
Let me guess:

04:16.567 --> 04:17.934
there was a stripper.

04:18.636 --> 04:20.168
You had a little fun.

04:20.171 --> 04:22.806
Maybe took some
ill-advised pictures.

04:22.808 --> 04:23.890
Next thing
you know,

04:23.892 --> 04:25.942
she's blackmailing you
into bankruptcy,

04:25.944 --> 04:27.360
and your medical degree's
hanging on the wall

04:27.362 --> 04:29.813
of a laser tag security office!

04:30.681 --> 04:32.949
No.

04:32.951 --> 04:34.818
The night of my bachelor party,
<i>my friends took me</i>

04:34.820 --> 04:36.152
<i>to a crappy hotel,</i>

04:36.154 --> 04:37.988
<i>hired my ex-fiancée</i>
<i>to be the stripper,</i>

04:37.990 --> 04:39.856
<i>I lost thousands of dollars,</i>
<i>and my best friend</i>

04:39.858 --> 04:40.857
<i>even had his hand cut off.</i>

04:40.859 --> 04:41.858
<i>It would've been</i>

04:41.860 --> 04:43.076
<i>the worst night of all time</i>

04:43.078 --> 04:44.360
if the whole thing hadn't been

04:44.362 --> 04:45.462
<i>a prank planned by</i>

04:45.464 --> 04:47.414
my beautiful, amazing fiancée.

04:47.416 --> 04:49.833
<i>She put me through hell</i>
<i>just to give me the best</i>

04:49.835 --> 04:52.218
<i>surprise of my life...which,</i>
<i>p.s.,included an appearance</i>

04:52.220 --> 04:53.420
<i>by my favorite actor--</i>

04:53.422 --> 04:55.505
<i>non-porn category.</i>

04:55.507 --> 04:57.707
Wow, that sounds pretty cool.

04:57.709 --> 04:59.576
Yeah. Except
pretty not cool,

04:59.578 --> 05:01.761
because he kept talking about
how he was gonna get me back,

05:01.763 --> 05:04.097
and sure enough,
a few days later...

05:04.099 --> 05:06.733
Robin, there's no
good way to say this.

05:07.401 --> 05:09.019
I've made a huge mistake.

05:09.021 --> 05:10.820
I can't go through
with the wedding.

05:10.822 --> 05:12.489
What?

05:12.491 --> 05:13.690
I'm so sorry.

05:13.692 --> 05:15.492
I-I just...
I had to tell you

05:15.494 --> 05:17.193
before it was too late.

05:18.012 --> 05:19.496
Oh, my God, you're serious.

05:19.498 --> 05:20.396
Yeah.

05:21.866 --> 05:23.232
And since this is my apartment,

05:23.234 --> 05:25.168
I think that
you should move out.

05:28.589 --> 05:29.756
Fine.

05:31.258 --> 05:34.410
Puppies!

05:36.430 --> 05:38.465
I know.
Great prank, right?

05:38.467 --> 05:40.083
That is awful.

05:40.085 --> 05:41.751
You're a frickin' weirdo.

05:41.753 --> 05:44.771
Such a weirdo.

05:44.773 --> 05:46.139
Careful, watch the robe.

05:46.141 --> 05:47.774
Anyway,

05:47.776 --> 05:49.776
for reasons only
you guys and Robin

05:49.778 --> 05:51.861
but nobody normal
like me would understand,

05:51.863 --> 05:53.262
she got cranky.

05:53.264 --> 05:55.148
And she laid
down the law.

05:55.150 --> 05:56.566
No more surprises.

05:56.568 --> 05:58.318
But you love surprises.

05:58.320 --> 06:01.237
Almost as much as
I love lickin' myself!

06:01.239 --> 06:03.106
That was me talking,
not the puppy.

06:03.108 --> 06:04.457
Barney, the surprises
are out of hand

06:04.459 --> 06:05.408
and they have to stop.

06:05.410 --> 06:06.960
Deal?
But...

06:06.962 --> 06:07.911
Deal?
But...

06:07.913 --> 06:10.046
Deal.
Butt...

06:10.048 --> 06:10.780
Barney...

06:10.782 --> 06:13.133
Fine.

06:13.135 --> 06:14.617
Deal.

06:15.452 --> 06:16.469
Man.

06:16.471 --> 06:18.421
This whole "no more
surprises" thing

06:18.423 --> 06:20.123
is so unfair.

06:20.125 --> 06:21.141
Who does that?

06:21.143 --> 06:23.476
Barney,
the "no more surprises" thing

06:23.478 --> 06:25.261
is the best part
of being married.

06:25.263 --> 06:26.796
It's true. When I wake up
in the morning,

06:26.798 --> 06:29.298
I know what Lily's breath
is gonna smell like.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.984
It's like...
roses.

06:31.719 --> 06:33.019
Do you really
want a marriage

06:33.021 --> 06:34.187
where you have
this paranoia

06:34.189 --> 06:36.156
that Robin's hiding
around every corner,

06:36.158 --> 06:38.608
planning to get you back
with some crazy new prank?

06:38.610 --> 06:40.527
You're
absolutely right.

06:40.529 --> 06:41.528
Thank you, Lily.

06:41.530 --> 06:43.613
No, th... 
that was me, over here.

06:43.615 --> 06:44.497
He wasn't listening.

06:44.499 --> 06:45.782
If you guys
are saying

06:45.784 --> 06:46.916
what I think
you're saying...

06:46.918 --> 06:48.118
Probably not.
Go on.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.152
...then that
must mean...

06:49.154 --> 06:50.153
No, it doesn't.

06:50.155 --> 06:52.455
...that Robin is
planning a surprise

06:52.457 --> 06:54.841
laser tag
rehearsal dinner!

06:57.790 --> 07:00.385
Dude, Robin is not planning

07:00.386 --> 07:02.386
a surprise laser tag
rehearsal dinner.

07:02.388 --> 07:03.337
Yes, she is.

07:03.339 --> 07:05.138
No, she isn't.
Yes, she is.

07:05.140 --> 07:06.773
No, I'm not!

07:06.775 --> 07:07.975
Yes, she is.

07:07.977 --> 07:09.743
No, she isn't.

07:09.745 --> 07:11.411
Then why did
she pretend

07:11.413 --> 07:13.513
to ridicule it
as an idiotic idea?

07:13.515 --> 07:16.683
Because it is
an idiotic idea.

07:16.685 --> 07:18.485
If Robin
actually was

07:18.487 --> 07:19.987
planning a surprise,

07:19.989 --> 07:22.055
don't you think she would
tell her maid of honor?

07:22.057 --> 07:23.941
She didn't tell you
'cause you can keep a secret

07:23.943 --> 07:25.826
the way my dentist
keeps his car keys.

07:27.262 --> 07:30.563
You don't know him,
but he's lost them...

07:30.565 --> 07:31.665
like, twice.

07:31.667 --> 07:32.899
Actually,
just once, and...

07:32.901 --> 07:35.002
that time they were
in his other pocket.

07:35.004 --> 07:37.204
I can't keep a secret?

07:37.206 --> 07:38.538
He does have a point, Lily.

07:38.540 --> 07:40.240
You're kind of famous for
the old blabbity-blabbity.

07:40.242 --> 07:41.375
Hey.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.593
How was lunch
with Debbie?

07:42.595 --> 07:44.211
Great.
She's pregnant!

07:44.213 --> 07:45.262
Oops.

07:45.264 --> 07:47.097
I'm not supposed to tell anybody.
Why not?

07:47.099 --> 07:48.765
Because she's getting
a divorce.

07:48.767 --> 07:49.916
Damn it!

07:49.918 --> 07:51.084
Debbie's getting
a divorce?

07:51.086 --> 07:53.804
Yeah, she walked in
on her husband having sex.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.022
Oh! Come on, Lily.

07:55.024 --> 07:56.773
Well, maybe we don't
need to know every gory...

07:56.775 --> 07:57.891
With a man.

07:57.893 --> 08:00.727
Will you get it
together, Aldrin?!

08:00.729 --> 08:01.895
You okay, Lily?

08:01.897 --> 08:04.597
And that guy's
the father of the baby.

08:04.599 --> 08:06.867
I gotta go lie down.

08:07.702 --> 08:09.987
Which brings us
to earlier today,

08:09.989 --> 08:12.956
when Robin was setting up
the decoy rehearsal dinner,

08:12.958 --> 08:14.875
complete with fake booze.

08:16.327 --> 08:18.378
Trying to pass
this off as Scotch,

08:18.380 --> 08:20.631
and we all know
it's apple juice.

08:26.471 --> 08:29.122
Typical apple juice burn.

08:30.058 --> 08:32.259
Yes, Barney,
the booze is real.

08:32.260 --> 08:33.559
The food is real.

08:33.562 --> 08:35.895
Ooh, speaking of which,
where are the bacon-wrapped figs?

08:35.898 --> 08:37.681
Probably at...

08:37.683 --> 08:38.965
...the laser tag place,

08:38.967 --> 08:41.268
where the real rehearsal
dinner's going down.

08:41.270 --> 08:44.438
Isn't that right,
Theodore?

08:44.440 --> 08:46.857
Barney, there is
no laser tag.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.108
We're gonna have
a nice dinner,

08:48.110 --> 08:49.526
some drinks,
and then,

08:49.528 --> 08:50.527
according to Robin,

08:50.529 --> 08:52.079
if her Aunt Edith
gets drunk enough,

08:52.081 --> 08:53.813
she'll take off her wig and
they'll play hockey with it.

08:53.815 --> 08:54.915
Poppycock!

08:54.917 --> 08:57.000
You know how
she's gonna do it,

08:57.002 --> 08:58.085
and you're gonna
tell me!

08:58.087 --> 09:01.288
Or do I have
to get my face

09:01.290 --> 09:04.657
even closer
to yours?

09:04.659 --> 09:05.658
Hey.

09:05.660 --> 09:06.927
How come you're
not getting

09:06.929 --> 09:08.495
uncomfortably
close to my face?

09:08.497 --> 09:10.997
I could be in on it, too.

09:12.667 --> 09:13.833
'Course you could,
Lil.

09:13.835 --> 09:15.469
I can keep a secret.

09:15.471 --> 09:16.887
Lily, don't
make me laugh.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.271
I'd trust you
with a secret

09:18.273 --> 09:20.190
as much as I'd trust
Marshall with Pop Secret.

09:20.192 --> 09:22.342
I can keep a secret!

09:22.344 --> 09:24.394
I can keep a secret
real good.

09:24.396 --> 09:26.730
I can keep a secret
like nobody's business,

09:26.732 --> 09:29.682
'cause it is
nobody's business.

09:29.684 --> 09:30.951
'Cause it's a secret,

09:30.953 --> 09:32.685
and I'm keeping it!

09:32.687 --> 09:33.653
Does Marshall
shave his back?

09:33.655 --> 09:35.688
No, I shave it
for him. Damn it!

09:35.690 --> 09:36.689
Ooh!

09:36.691 --> 09:38.041
I should call
Marshall.

09:38.043 --> 09:39.576
I bet he's
in on this.

09:39.578 --> 09:41.694
If he really exists.

09:42.863 --> 09:44.364
Okay.

09:44.366 --> 09:45.632
Setting aside the fact

09:45.634 --> 09:46.833
that I've kept your whole

09:46.835 --> 09:49.136
"moving to Chicago" thing
a secret,

09:49.138 --> 09:52.038
aren't you supposed to be
dressed like Liberace right now?

09:52.040 --> 09:53.590
Okay, first of all,

09:53.592 --> 09:55.225
if I showed up in costume,

09:55.227 --> 09:57.010
it would steal from
the surprise and spectacle

09:57.012 --> 09:58.395
of my grand entrance.

09:58.397 --> 10:00.180
And second of all,
I'm not doing that.

10:00.182 --> 10:01.348
Why not?

10:01.350 --> 10:04.717
Because dressing like Liberace
is easy, but...

10:04.719 --> 10:08.388
Uh, yes, 4/4, E-sharp...

10:08.390 --> 10:11.724
major...

10:11.726 --> 10:13.443
Okay.

10:13.445 --> 10:16.947
Let's make something
beautiful, shall we?

10:19.401 --> 10:21.401
I think that's
enough for today.

10:22.787 --> 10:25.505
Okay, I figured out how
this is gonna go down.

10:25.507 --> 10:27.924
We're gonna "run out" of ice,

10:27.926 --> 10:29.909
and Robin's gonna ask me
to go get some,

10:29.911 --> 10:32.512
and lo and behold,
the only place that sells ice

10:32.514 --> 10:36.550
in this whole town is right next
to the local laser taggery.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.218
I go inside and...

10:38.220 --> 10:39.352
Surprise!

10:39.354 --> 10:41.721
Beautiful dinner,
family and friends,

10:41.723 --> 10:44.224
free game tokens
and an off-road arcade game

10:44.226 --> 10:46.226
that's rigged
for unlimited turbos!

10:46.228 --> 10:48.145
That is the
single stupidest...

10:48.147 --> 10:49.563
Guys, you aren't
gonna believe this.

10:49.565 --> 10:51.782
The ice machine
is broken.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.733
Is it now?

10:53.735 --> 10:57.537
Well, dog my cats,
what a the chances?

10:57.539 --> 11:00.040
Huh? What do we do?

11:00.042 --> 11:02.742
Well, I guess I could go get
some ice.

11:02.744 --> 11:03.877
Uh, no,
they'll send someone.

11:03.879 --> 11:05.579
All right, fine.
Twist my arm. I'll do it.

11:05.581 --> 11:06.713
But seriously,
Hmm?

11:06.715 --> 11:08.498
did you get everything set up
over there?

11:08.500 --> 11:10.167
Do you have enough food,
have enough guns?

11:10.169 --> 11:12.752
Did you get a vest extender
for Grandma Stinson? She's...

11:12.754 --> 11:15.222
What are you
talking about?

11:15.224 --> 11:19.309
Oh, babe, you're so good
at this. I love it.

11:19.311 --> 11:21.261
All right, I'll see you guys
over there.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.762
I mean, be right back.

11:22.764 --> 11:26.566
Barney, Barney, this is
our rehearsal dinner, okay?

11:26.568 --> 11:28.268
Do not leave the premises.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.070
Promise me you're not going
anywhere.

11:30.072 --> 11:31.154
Fine.

11:31.156 --> 11:31.988
Say it.

11:31.990 --> 11:34.491
Say you promise
you won't leave.

11:34.493 --> 11:37.861
I promise I won't leave.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.996
So I left.
And what do you know,

11:39.998 --> 11:44.084
the ice store is right next
to a laser tag place!

11:44.086 --> 11:46.486
No, it isn't!
It's six miles away

11:46.488 --> 11:47.671
he opposite direction.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.506
And I told you not to go!

11:49.508 --> 11:50.707
Yeah, well, you also told me

11:50.709 --> 11:52.659
didn't want a ring bear
at the wedding.

11:52.661 --> 11:53.627
Ring bear-er!

11:53.629 --> 11:54.678
We all know how great

11:54.680 --> 11:55.828
that's gonna be. The point is,

11:55.830 --> 11:57.214
I played along with her plan,

11:57.216 --> 12:00.833
and I acted "natural" so I
wouldn't spoil the surprise.

12:00.835 --> 12:03.587
Oh, my goodness!

12:03.589 --> 12:05.388
Laser tag?!

12:05.390 --> 12:07.507
Maybe I should go in here
for a minute,

12:07.509 --> 12:09.226
just check it out
for no apparent reason.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.843
And what's this?

12:10.845 --> 12:13.346
My hands-free token satchel?

12:13.348 --> 12:15.949
And my free lifetime refill
root beer mug?

12:18.069 --> 12:20.070
So for the past
two months

12:20.072 --> 12:22.122
when we were letting you use
our apartment

12:22.124 --> 12:24.023
to practice the piano
every Sunday night,

12:24.025 --> 12:25.408
what were you doing?

12:25.410 --> 12:29.579
Oh, so that's not traveling
'cause he's the MVP?

12:29.581 --> 12:32.365
Come on!

12:32.367 --> 12:35.001
Where's Barney?
Has anyone seen him?

12:35.003 --> 12:36.369
Robin, Ted's totally bailing

12:36.371 --> 12:38.338
on playing the piano
for you and Barney.

12:38.340 --> 12:41.975
Oh, really? Ted, you didn't
have to not do that.

12:41.977 --> 12:43.009
But thank you.

12:43.011 --> 12:45.729
But he promised!
A promise is a promise.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.514
You can't say you're
gonna do something

12:47.516 --> 12:50.216
and then suddenly do something
completely different!

12:50.218 --> 12:52.018
Why are you getting
so worked up about this?

12:52.020 --> 12:55.822
Because, obviously, I'm worked
up for a different

12:55.824 --> 12:56.856
but somewhat similar reason.

12:56.858 --> 12:58.525
And someone should ask me
about it!

12:58.527 --> 13:01.278
I'm sorry. I don't have time
for your drama right now, Lily.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.445
My fiancé is missing.

13:02.447 --> 13:04.331
Marshall got picked
to be a judge.

13:04.333 --> 13:06.533
He took the job
without even asking me.

13:07.234 --> 13:09.068
Italy's off!

13:10.919 --> 13:14.588
I have time for your drama.

13:17.805 --> 13:21.516
So, Marshall can't go to Italy?
Not if he wants to be a judge.

13:21.540 --> 13:23.907
And my Italian was getting
so good.

13:24.236 --> 13:27.120
It was so.

13:30.524 --> 13:32.792
But wait, you guys already
sublet the apartment.

13:32.794 --> 13:34.661
You're already packed.

13:34.663 --> 13:37.380
Marshall already borrowed
and lost my Rosetta Stone.

13:37.382 --> 13:39.082
That selfish bastard!

13:39.084 --> 13:41.401
Sorry, Lil. Hello.

13:41.403 --> 13:43.136
Okay, I'm mad, too.

13:43.138 --> 13:44.638
I should hope so.

13:44.640 --> 13:47.123
All of a sudden, his dream
is more important than yours?

13:47.125 --> 13:48.792
And he did it behind your back.

13:48.794 --> 13:49.993
<i>Bastardo!</i>

13:49.995 --> 13:51.761
He would never hurt me
intentionally.

13:51.763 --> 13:53.513
I'll hurt him intentionally.

13:53.515 --> 13:54.814
<i>Molto bastardo!</i>

13:54.816 --> 13:56.066
That's sweet of you to say.

13:56.068 --> 13:58.218
You could never take
Marshall in a million years,

13:58.220 --> 14:00.070
but that's sweet of you to say.

14:00.072 --> 14:04.074
Well, apparently, Barney went
to the laser tag place

14:04.076 --> 14:06.743
looking for a surprise
rehearsal dinner.

14:06.745 --> 14:09.062
When he didn't find one,
he threatened

14:09.064 --> 14:10.730
to dunk
the snack bar guy's head

14:10.732 --> 14:14.367
into a vat
of scalding nacho Whiz.

14:14.369 --> 14:16.036
He's being held
until the police arrive

14:16.038 --> 14:18.922
I need your apple juice.

14:19.907 --> 14:22.676
Ha!

14:22.678 --> 14:24.010
And here we are.

14:24.012 --> 14:27.931
Now, I believe this charade
has gone on long enough.

14:27.933 --> 14:31.584
Can we please get to the
surprise laser tag rehearsal?

14:31.586 --> 14:34.137
Hey, there is no surprise
laser tag rehearsal dinner!

14:34.139 --> 14:38.091
Okay, but if I may offer
an opposing view.

14:38.093 --> 14:39.726
Of course there is!

14:39.728 --> 14:41.928
This place is lousy
with clues.

14:41.930 --> 14:45.398
Is he even really
a security guard?

14:45.400 --> 14:48.034
Because he looks an awful lot
like a non-Pakistani version

14:48.036 --> 14:51.037
of the guy who delivers
sandwiches at my office.

14:51.039 --> 14:52.706
Also...

14:52.708 --> 14:59.612
"laser tag" has the same number
of letters as "rehearsal."

14:59.614 --> 15:02.832
Laser tag has eight,
rehearsal has nine.

15:02.834 --> 15:07.387
And if you rearrange the letters
and add some other ones,

15:07.389 --> 15:11.641
it says, "Get ready, Barney,
for the biggest surprise ever,

15:11.643 --> 15:13.994
you handsome son of a..."

15:13.996 --> 15:16.462
and then not quite enough
letters for "bitch,"

15:16.464 --> 15:17.514
but good try, Robin.

15:17.516 --> 15:19.849
This is crazy, Barney.

15:19.851 --> 15:22.018
We-We can't have a marriage
like this.

15:22.020 --> 15:26.022
A marriage has to be built on
honesty and trust

15:26.024 --> 15:28.408
and all of that Lily-
and-Marshall crap.

15:28.410 --> 15:31.778
I though our marriage was built
on honesty and trust

15:31.780 --> 15:35.198
and all that Lily-
and-Marshal crap.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.917
I just feel so alone right now.

15:37.919 --> 15:40.537
ll, you're not. I'm here.

15:41.655 --> 15:44.090
And I know you can keep
a secret.

15:44.092 --> 15:46.092
Yeah, right.

15:46.094 --> 15:47.344
Tell you what.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.996
How about I let you in
on another secret?

15:49.998 --> 15:51.965
Something bigger.

15:51.967 --> 15:53.967
Bigger than Chicago?

15:55.586 --> 15:58.471
Are you kidding?

15:58.473 --> 16:01.441
Nope. Want to do the honors?

16:05.029 --> 16:06.846
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:06.848 --> 16:10.183
there's been a slight change
of plan.

16:10.185 --> 16:12.118
Fine! Fine.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.570
You're right, Robin.

16:13.572 --> 16:16.406
Marriage isn't about playing
crazy pranks.

16:16.408 --> 16:19.525
It isn't about telling
long expertly crafted lies

16:19.527 --> 16:20.627
to cover those pranks...

16:20.629 --> 16:22.412
How'd you get out
of those handcuffs?

16:22.414 --> 16:24.581
...and hiring actors
to play security guards

16:24.583 --> 16:27.167
and spending exorbitant
amounts of money on things

16:27.169 --> 16:29.219
like giant,
fake laser tag signs.

16:29.221 --> 16:31.054
No, it's about honesty.

16:31.056 --> 16:33.173
Size six skate, right?

16:33.175 --> 16:34.224
Yeah.

16:34.226 --> 16:37.594
And in that spirit,
I got to be honest.

16:37.596 --> 16:40.180
Every now and then,

16:40.182 --> 16:44.384
I am gonna lie to you.
I just am.

16:44.386 --> 16:47.720
If it's in the interest
of an amazing surprise, that is.

16:47.722 --> 16:51.991
You're gonna get bamboozled,
hoodwinked.

16:51.993 --> 16:54.444
Heck, I'll just say it.

16:54.446 --> 16:57.163
You're gonna get snowed.

16:59.250 --> 17:00.750
Why is it snowing in here?

17:00.752 --> 17:01.918
Put on the skates.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.336
We gotta go.

17:03.338 --> 17:05.121
Where?

17:05.123 --> 17:07.406
Where are we going?

17:07.409 --> 17:09.626
To the rehearsal dinner, silly.

17:10.461 --> 17:13.046
Let's get this party started.

17:15.883 --> 17:18.017
What?!

17:18.019 --> 17:19.969
Surprise!

17:20.753 --> 17:23.272
What-What is going on?

17:23.275 --> 17:27.694
I know how much you wanted
to be in Canada this weekend.

17:27.695 --> 17:29.612
So I brought Canada to you.

17:29.614 --> 17:33.099
Oh, and here's an autographed
picture of Wayne Gretzky.

17:33.101 --> 17:34.434
Thanks.

17:34.436 --> 17:37.570
And this guy's not really
a security guard.

17:41.041 --> 17:45.628
♪ Once there was this boy who

17:45.630 --> 17:51.784

that stuff was "legendary" ♪

17:51.786 --> 17:55.839
♪ He gave lots of high fives

17:55.841 --> 17:58.975

17:58.977 --> 18:04.063
♪ That he would
never get married ♪

18:05.232 --> 18:07.434
♪ He really thought
he meant it ♪

18:07.436 --> 18:09.569
Thanks for letting me
in on this.

18:09.571 --> 18:11.521
Even if it was
at the very end.

18:11.523 --> 18:12.655
My pleasure.

18:12.657 --> 18:14.190
Oh, and by the way,

18:14.192 --> 18:16.159
there's one more secret
I've been keeping.

18:16.161 --> 18:17.694
All those nights
I was supposed

18:17.696 --> 18:19.078
to be taking piano lessons?

18:19.080 --> 18:23.833
I was actually taking
figure skating lessons!

18:25.536 --> 18:28.288
♪ Once, there was
this girl who... ♪

18:28.290 --> 18:30.206

18:34.645 --> 18:36.129
I love you.

18:36.131 --> 18:38.181
I love you, too.

18:38.183 --> 18:40.717
I'm gonna get you back, you know?
Bring it.

18:40.719 --> 18:48.174
♪ And swore she'd also
never get married ♪

18:48.176 --> 18:51.778
♪ She really thought
she meant it. ♪

18:56.578 --> 18:58.796
I can't believe
you did all of this.

18:58.798 --> 19:00.631
Hey, I thought you
didn't like Canada.

19:00.633 --> 19:02.550
Are you kidding?
I love Canada.

19:02.552 --> 19:06.787
Holy musk ox,

19:06.789 --> 19:07.922
Whoa!

19:07.924 --> 19:10.224
In 1924,
I discovered insulin.

19:10.226 --> 19:12.093
Take that, diabetes.

19:12.095 --> 19:15.212
Hey, look, it's Manitoba's
native son, Norman Breakey.

19:15.214 --> 19:16.314
You're welcome, world.

19:16.316 --> 19:19.483
Enjoy my invention,
the paint roller.

19:19.485 --> 19:22.320
And of course,
you know Alan Thicke.

19:22.322 --> 19:23.988
Hey, hey, you...
Oh, hey.

19:23.990 --> 19:25.890
...are the prettiest girl
in the place.

19:25.892 --> 19:27.024
Oh, thank you,
Alan.

19:27.026 --> 19:28.559
All right, all right,
all right.

19:28.561 --> 19:29.694
Good to see you.

19:29.696 --> 19:30.995
Hey, look,
it's Louise Poirier,

19:30.997 --> 19:32.697
who I think worked
for the company

19:32.699 --> 19:34.115
that probably created
Wonderbra.

19:36.419 --> 19:37.835
Okay, okay.

19:37.837 --> 19:40.777
Canadians also helped
win two world wars...

19:40.802 --> 19:41.456
Mm-hmm.

19:41.457 --> 19:43.257
...and gave the world
Neil Young, William Shatner,

19:43.259 --> 19:44.909

Pamela Anderson,

Thank you.
