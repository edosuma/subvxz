on Macapa's ever sold

17:10.563 --> 17:13.660
that's land value at 3 1/2.

17:13.990 --> 17:14.768
I think the house next
door sold for four-something.

17:14.800 --> 17:15.701
- 4 1/2.

17:15.734 --> 17:18.407
- 4 1/2, and it was
a totally new house.

17:18.408 --> 17:20.730
- I know that the
value is in the land.

17:20.731 --> 17:23.476
However, the house--
It's not a teardown.

17:23.509 --> 17:24.477
- Uh-huh.

17:24.510 --> 17:27.456
- And I want to sell
it to the right person.

17:27.457 --> 17:29.749
It's important to me that it's
someone who can appreciate

17:29.782 --> 17:32.251
the whole vibe of
it, the Rat Pack idea.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.520
- The problem is this:
you're giving me 30 days,

17:34.554 --> 17:36.756
but you also don't want
anybody to tear the house down,

17:36.789 --> 17:38.324
and the likelihood is that,

17:38.357 --> 17:40.527
to find that person that
is gonna appreciate it

17:40.559 --> 17:42.729
and not just want to knock
it down like everybody else,

17:42.761 --> 17:44.530
I need a little bit more time.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.633
In 30 days, it's just gonna be
people that they're just doing

17:46.665 --> 17:49.201
the numbers--you know, in,
out, "Here's what I'll pay for it."

17:49.234 --> 17:51.304
- The bones of the
house, I think, are good.

17:51.337 --> 17:52.538
- The bones are good.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.773
But I still think that
this is a teardown.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.643
<i>Jeanne is clearly
attached to this house.</i>

17:56.675 --> 17:58.510
<i>She lived here with her husband.</i>

17:58.545 --> 18:00.313
<i>I mean, I get it.</i>

18:00.346 --> 18:02.315
The problem is, Jeanne
wants three things:

18:02.348 --> 18:05.285
don't tear it down,
price it at 3 1/2 million,

18:05.317 --> 18:07.319
<i>and she wants
it sold in 30 days.</i>

18:07.354 --> 18:11.657
Even the best broker--me--

18:11.691 --> 18:13.425
Can only do two of those things.

18:13.460 --> 18:16.395
- I would prefer that
someone buy the house

18:16.429 --> 18:17.663
that can appreciate it.

18:17.696 --> 18:22.268
However, if it's impossible, I
don't want to tie your hands.

18:22.301 --> 18:23.269
- Okay.

18:23.303 --> 18:26.239
- And I will consider someone

18:26.271 --> 18:29.375
that wants to do a
little overdeveloping.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.678
- Okay. We'll put
it on at 3,500,000.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.212
Let's see what happens.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.681
- So 30 days, we'll do it.

18:34.713 --> 18:35.848
- Okay. We'll get it done.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.518
- Do you want to have dinner?
- Sure. I'm in no hurry.

18:38.550 --> 18:39.586
- It'd be fun.
- Yeah.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.721

18:45.557 --> 18:46.692
<i>- Coming up...</i>

18:46.726 --> 18:49.261

10 Beverly Park.

18:53.666 --> 18:54.667

19:24.196 --> 19:25.731
Having, like, a little
mini-panic attack.

19:25.765 --> 19:29.269
I'm flipping out because
Shelley doesn't know

19:29.301 --> 19:30.869
that we've lost our offer,

19:30.903 --> 19:33.440
and I need, like,
a little pep talk.

19:33.472 --> 19:37.609
Abbington has been a
difficult property from the start.

19:37.644 --> 19:41.580
I literally was just confirming
up two showings for tomorrow.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.621
- Does anyone else
have a question?

19:48.654 --> 19:50.623
My God.

19:50.656 --> 19:53.192
I just lost everybody.
This is going well.

19:53.226 --> 19:57.763
We signed a deal at full
ask, but they pulled out.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.440
<i>- I immediately called
our backup offers</i>

20:07.473 --> 20:08.942
and wanted to make sure

20:08.974 --> 20:12.278
that they were still
interested before I call Shelley

20:12.311 --> 20:14.646
and tell her that I had
just lost what we had.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.516
I just have to be
honest with her

20:16.548 --> 20:18.550
and say, "Look, we lost it.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.886
"That's the risk we
took in a pandemic,

20:20.920 --> 20:23.323
when you're not
allowed to show a house."

20:23.355 --> 20:25.959
I'm nervous to have
these conversations,

20:25.991 --> 20:27.426
obviously, in front of her,

20:27.460 --> 20:29.796
but I think that's the
only way I can get it done.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.670

call you later. Bye.

Park the other day.

21:26.318 --> 21:27.386
I met a guy named Yuri,

<i>and I saw this property,

21:35.260 --> 21:37.931

well, that explains it,

21:37.963 --> 21:39.766

I had the listing,

21:39.798 --> 21:42.669

it with Altman."

21:54.547 --> 21:55.682
- Yes.

I thought long and hard
about co-listing with Altman.

21:58.917 --> 22:00.886
<i>But in the end, I'm gonna do it,</i>

22:00.920 --> 22:04.758

Actually, I'm obsessed

22:04.790 --> 22:06.859

top broker in LA,

22:06.893 --> 22:09.261

You've seen the house?

22:17.770 --> 22:18.904

22:24.644 --> 22:26.378
- Maybe 'cause I'm the best?

22:26.413 --> 22:28.480
And maybe he wants
some fresh blood in LA

22:28.515 --> 22:29.915

He's wants the internationals.
It's not a bad thing, Josh.

it long and hard.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.894
And yes, at first, I was like
maybe how you're feeling now.

It's a disappointment.

They have, like,
a 30-day escrow.

like, a little bit lower.

26:17.876 --> 26:19.278

26:19.311 --> 26:20.814
- Mm-hmm.

26:20.846 --> 26:22.115

26:22.147 --> 26:24.483

26:24.517 --> 26:28.120
- I see. That's--the
loan contingency--

them the ability,

if it doesn't appraise,

26:31.223 --> 26:33.526

<i>Both of these backup
buyers have loan</i>

27:11.297 --> 27:13.932
and inspection contingencies,
which is good for them,

27:14.339 --> 27:16.336
because they can do their
due diligence on the house.

27:16.368 --> 27:19.673
<i>But any kind of
contingency in a deal like this</i>

27:19.705 --> 27:20.773
<i>is not good,</i>

door for them to back out.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.529
- I know, and you haven't
had the kids in yet either.

28:13.727 --> 28:15.694
- I will let you know one
way or the other, I promise.

28:15.729 --> 28:17.730
So I'm gonna go
talk to them right now.

28:19.990 --> 28:22.902
- I can't in good
conscious expect a buyer

28:22.935 --> 28:27.240
to go noncontingent without
even having been in the house.

28:27.272 --> 28:28.907
<i>So what I'm going to do</i>

28:28.942 --> 28:31.243
is pass on the inspections
from the first buyer,

28:31.277 --> 28:34.948
so that both parties can
see every piece of diligence

28:35.480 --> 28:36.348
that has already been done.

28:36.383 --> 28:39.285
All right. So her
name is Ashley.

28:39.318 --> 28:42.689
And they're a family, but
she makes the decisions.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.568
So she came up.

28:44.569 --> 28:45.578
- How much?

28:45.579 --> 28:49.662
- 6.4, 30-day escrow,
financing contingency

28:49.695 --> 28:52.649
and appraisal
contingency of 21 days.

28:52.650 --> 28:53.866
Okay?
- Hmm.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.268
- Our other offer from Karina...

28:55.300 --> 28:56.736
- Mm-hmm.

28:56.769 --> 28:59.138
- Is obviously $100,000 less.
- Mm-hmm.

28:59.172 --> 29:00.773
- Karina went to
the house yesterday.

29:00.807 --> 29:02.342
She saw it empty.
- Yeah.

29:02.375 --> 29:03.910
<i>- Not a stitch
of furniture in it.</i>

29:04.099 --> 29:04.877
<i>- Yeah.</i>

29:04.911 --> 29:06.813
<i>- And was still
madly in love with it.</i>

29:06.846 --> 29:08.381
And I know she
has a 30-day escrow,

29:08.414 --> 29:11.684
and I know she also has
a contingency in place

29:11.718 --> 29:13.219
for a loan and appraisal.

29:13.252 --> 29:16.756
If I was to call her and see
if she could go all cash...

29:16.789 --> 29:18.758
- Okay.
- And pay cash up front,

29:18.791 --> 29:22.279
would you be willing
to take $100,000 less?

29:22.619 --> 29:24.130
- If they remove
all contingency.

29:24.163 --> 29:26.665
- I mean, this is a big ask.

29:26.700 --> 29:28.401
- Let's see what you can do.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.359
Call them. See.
- Okay.

29:30.700 --> 29:31.938
Oh, my God. This is, like...
- Yeah. Yeah.

29:32.380 --> 29:33.839
<i>- I--this is crazy.</i>

29:33.873 --> 29:38.877
There are maybe 1% of
deals that are noncontingent.

29:38.912 --> 29:43.489
<i>So if I can't get Karina
to go contingency-free,</i>

29:43.490 --> 29:45.508
<i>then I'm basically
back at square one.</i>

29:45.509 --> 29:46.286
And then I'm
probably getting fired.

29:46.318 --> 29:47.287
Let's call a spade a space.

29:47.319 --> 29:49.549
Maybe they hire someone
like Fredrik Eklund.

29:49.890 --> 29:50.256
Karina?

29:52.826 --> 29:54.160
- Hi, honey. How are you?

29:55.327 --> 29:59.650
- I am standing outside
of my client's house,

29:59.990 --> 30:04.336
and she wants to put this back
in escrow as fast as possible.

30:04.371 --> 30:07.105
Now, if you are willing--

30:07.106 --> 30:09.875
And I know this is
a little bit of an ask--

30:09.909 --> 30:15.248
If you are willing to go
contingency-free on this deal

30:15.280 --> 30:19.285
and close all-cash for me,
my client will choose you.

30:23.522 --> 30:27.493
- All-cash means you
can pay cash for the house.

30:27.527 --> 30:30.797
That does not mean you
have to pay cash for the house.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.333
<i>And Karina has
shown proof of funds.</i>

30:33.365 --> 30:36.435
<i>So that makes her the
cleanest deal on the table</i>

30:36.469 --> 30:38.904
and the buyer that I
want my client to go with.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.285
- Congratulations.
Let's do the paperwork.

30:52.317 --> 30:55.989
I will go tell my client.
She is going to be thrilled.

30:59.392 --> 31:01.126
- All right, honey, let me
know if you need anything.

31:01.161 --> 31:02.828
Thank you so much.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.166
- Wow. <i>Yes!</i>

31:07.200 --> 31:12.104
I want to, like, pas de bourrée
or chassé or jazz hand myself

31:12.105 --> 31:14.473
back into the kitchen,
but this dress is too tight.

31:14.507 --> 31:17.977
And by the way, who pulls
off selling a $6 million house

31:18.779 --> 31:18.978
on Zoom?

31:19.789 --> 31:21.146
I do. Apparently.

31:21.181 --> 31:22.449
- So how'd it go?

31:22.481 --> 31:25.984
- She went
noncontingent. She did it.

31:26.859 --> 31:27.886
- Wow! That's great!

31:27.921 --> 31:30.899
- We have a deal!
- Yeah! Yeah!

31:30.900 --> 31:32.392
Oh, my God! That is great!

31:32.424 --> 31:35.126
This time, she can't
back out. That's it.

31:35.127 --> 31:38.979
- Honey, noncontingent.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.934
Not an inspection contingency,
not a financing contingency,

31:41.968 --> 31:44.170
not an appraisal contingency,
and a 30-day escrow.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.405
- We're done. We're done.
- She's beside herself.

31:46.439 --> 31:49.942
- Yeah. Yeah. That's
great. Thank you so much.

31:49.976 --> 31:50.943
- Honestly, thank
God. I was, like...

31:50.977 --> 31:52.945
- Oh, my God.
- Sweating out there, pacing.

31:52.979 --> 31:55.147
- Oh, I'm so happy. Relieved.

31:56.548 --> 31:57.851
<i>- Coming up...</i>

31:57.884 --> 31:59.486
- I've been searching
for a long time

31:59.519 --> 32:01.320
with your amazing
brokers, you two.

32:01.354 --> 32:02.355
Close your eyes.

32:02.388 --> 32:05.191
- I mean, they're not
buying it, but, you know,

32:25.478 --> 32:26.578
- [mimics horn honking]

32:27.113 --> 32:29.516
- Is that a spider net?

32:29.548 --> 32:30.884
Come with me, spider.

32:32.285 --> 32:34.253
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

32:34.287 --> 32:36.489
- Appreciate it.

32:36.522 --> 32:38.909
Freddy.

32:38.910 --> 32:39.291
- Hey!
- Whoa.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.326
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

32:41.361 --> 32:43.997
- Whoa!
- Corona hug.

32:44.970 --> 32:45.432
How are you, man?

32:45.464 --> 32:46.965
- This is our first
listing together.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.134
I'm excited.

32:48.167 --> 32:50.135
How are you gonna-- how
are you gonna sell this?

32:50.170 --> 32:52.572
Like, how are you--
- [chuckles]

32:52.605 --> 32:54.374
<i>Frederik and I,
we've definitely had</i>

32:54.406 --> 32:55.541
<i>our differences in the past,</i>

32:55.575 --> 32:57.109
so I was a little shocked

32:57.143 --> 32:59.244
when he called to
co-list Beverly Park.

32:59.278 --> 33:02.115
I see this as a olive
branch from Fredrik.

33:02.147 --> 33:05.484
It's a $29 million
or so listing.

33:05.518 --> 33:07.487
I think I should take it.

33:07.519 --> 33:11.624
Got two options:
co-list or no co-list.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.393
What do you do?

33:14.160 --> 33:15.461
[both laugh]

33:15.494 --> 33:17.396
- See? She's very collaborative.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.400
- All right. Co-list it is.

33:20.432 --> 33:22.167
I've done deals
with the seller before,

33:22.201 --> 33:24.703
<i>and they've gone smoothly,
so of course I said yes.</i>

33:24.738 --> 33:26.573
I want to sell every
house in there

33:26.605 --> 33:29.476
and one day be able to
afford to buy a house in there.

33:29.509 --> 33:32.444
Beverly Park, in
my opinion, I think,

33:32.479 --> 33:36.415
is the premier gated
community in the entire planet.

33:36.449 --> 33:38.351
- Sick location. The best.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.118
- It's a real deal.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.879
It's a real seller,
and it's priced to sell.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.723
- Is it priced to sell?
- Everything's priced to sell.

33:44.758 --> 33:45.759
- Okay, 'cause I've heard

33:45.791 --> 33:47.626
some people in this
town think I'm overpricing.

33:47.660 --> 33:48.795
I'm like, I like to
set the records.

33:48.827 --> 33:51.931
You know, I like to get my
sellers happy, not unhappy.

33:51.964 --> 33:54.366
I'm actually excited for
Altman and I to co-list.

33:54.401 --> 33:56.368
I mean, I think we're
gonna be a great team.

33:56.403 --> 33:57.770
- You want to live
in Beverly Park?

33:57.804 --> 33:59.439
Okay, cool. What's available?

33:59.471 --> 34:01.508
Oh, wait, it's just
Fredrik and Josh's listing.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.410
I guess you're gonna
have to pay, right?

34:03.442 --> 34:05.178
Because where else
are they gonna buy?

34:05.211 --> 34:07.614
- We are reaching
out to all the buyers

34:07.646 --> 34:09.181
that are looking to
buy into Beverly Park

34:09.215 --> 34:12.686
or any kind of really
expensive Beverly Hills location.

34:12.719 --> 34:15.487
<i>And we're hopeful the

34:15.521 --> 34:19.592

34:19.626 --> 34:20.726
- How are you?

34:20.760 --> 34:22.161
- Hi.
- Hi, guys. How are you?

34:22.195 --> 34:23.630
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

34:23.663 --> 34:25.364
- How's everything? You
doing well? Come on in.

34:25.398 --> 34:26.565
- I like what you guys
are wearing. Like, I need--

34:26.599 --> 34:27.733
- Oh, thank you.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.436
- I need to step up
my fashion game.

34:29.469 --> 34:32.204
- Anthony and Julia
both have clients.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.206
One of them is overseas.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.141
And then Julia,
you have that athlete

34:36.175 --> 34:37.643
that wants to come in here.
- Exactly.

34:37.677 --> 34:39.646
- Beverly Park, as you
know, there's a lot of athletes.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.146
And, you know, the privacy
and the gate and all that.

34:41.181 --> 34:42.215
- Right.

34:42.248 --> 34:43.483
- So it's perfect for him.
- Yeah.

34:43.516 --> 34:44.284
- How you doing?
- Josh.

34:44.317 --> 34:45.485
- Sunny.
- Pleasure to meet you.

34:45.518 --> 34:46.485
- Good to meet you.
- Seema.

34:46.518 --> 34:47.721
- Seema? Nice to meet you.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.888
- So they're actually
clients of mine,

34:49.889 --> 34:50.899
and we've been
looking for a while.

34:50.900 --> 34:51.123
Why don't we do this?

34:51.157 --> 34:53.226
Why don't, like, maybe,
Sunny, you go with Josh?

34:53.259 --> 34:55.128
'Cause it's a big
house. I'll take you.

34:55.161 --> 34:56.730
'Cause we need
to catch up anyway.

34:56.762 --> 34:57.996
- Nice.

35:00.500 --> 35:01.534
- Two acres.

35:01.568 --> 35:04.704
13,500 square feet.

35:04.737 --> 35:07.474
The view is spectacular.

35:07.507 --> 35:11.440
So I've been thinking,
what you been looking for?

35:11.769 --> 35:13.612
- He's, like, very
contemporary/modern,

35:13.646 --> 35:16.382
and I like things that are
a little bit more traditional.

35:16.416 --> 35:17.784
- So you're more like me.
- Mm-hmm.

35:17.817 --> 35:21.253
- And maybe these lamps
are a little too historic.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.755
- They're a little much.

35:22.789 --> 35:24.391
- Much?
- [laughs]

35:24.423 --> 35:25.557
- You just need to, like--

35:25.592 --> 35:26.726
[squeaks] A little
bit to your style.

35:26.760 --> 35:29.161
- Right.
- Okay, let's continue.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.797
- Picture it as your style.
- Mm-hmm.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.532
- This might not be your style.
- For sure, it's not.

35:32.565 --> 35:34.134
- It's incredible.

35:34.166 --> 35:36.396
You just gotta have a
little bit of imagination.

35:36.397 --> 35:38.771
Check out this primary
bedroom. Awesome setup, right?

35:38.804 --> 35:41.541
If you don't want your
wife to see you, you can get

35:41.574 --> 35:44.210
the same-colored suit as
this, and you can just stand

35:44.244 --> 35:46.211
in the wall like this
and don't move...

35:46.246 --> 35:47.456
- There it is.

35:47.457 --> 35:49.820
- And she'll never
know you're here.

35:49.114 --> 35:50.215
<i>I like this house.</i>

35:50.250 --> 35:52.652
I actually walked
through this house

35:52.686 --> 35:54.487

things that I could do to it

35:54.521 --> 35:56.188

36:14.340 --> 36:15.375
I mean...
- Mm-hmm.

36:15.407 --> 36:18.610
I love the exterior.
- Oh, you love the exterior.

36:18.644 --> 36:19.813
- Yeah, like--
- Not the interior?

36:19.846 --> 36:21.681
- Oh, no, it's pretty. But...
- Yeah.

36:21.715 --> 36:23.682
- You know, definitely

36:23.717 --> 36:26.251
- I know Yuri wants
me to sell the furniture.

But my job is to get

able to walk through.

36:53.346 --> 36:54.947
- No, no, no, close your eyes.

37:16.335 --> 37:17.369
- No, no, no, don't you feel--

37:17.403 --> 37:19.371
When you opened your
eyes, didn't you feel at home?

37:19.405 --> 37:22.307
- Yeah, or you can just look
around and not close your eyes.

37:23.842 --> 37:26.278
- [laughs]
- Do you want, like, "Whoo!"

37:26.311 --> 37:27.914
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

37:27.947 --> 37:30.315
- A lot of "wee" s, a
lot of kicks, a lot of,

37:30.349 --> 37:33.253
<i>"I'm Fredrik Eklund.
This is my property.</i>

37:33.286 --> 37:34.853
"And--oh, you want to
see the property too?

37:34.887 --> 37:36.789
I thought you were
here just to see me."

37:36.822 --> 37:39.559
- Close your eyes. Feel
it. Feel it in your heart.

37:41.260 --> 37:43.630
- No, you're not feeling it.
- I don't know.

37:43.663 --> 37:44.898
<i>- That's my
impression of Fredrik.</i>

37:44.931 --> 37:46.632
[laughs]

37:46.666 --> 37:49.436
The house actually
is pretty tricked out.

37:49.469 --> 37:51.271
So you got the gym, the theater,

37:51.304 --> 37:52.438
all the bedroom count.

37:53.907 --> 37:55.240
- Tricked out?

37:55.275 --> 37:56.242
- Yeah, tricked out.

37:56.275 --> 37:58.779
- Do you feel like it's warm?

37:58.780 --> 37:59.411
You can see kids running around.

37:59.445 --> 38:01.414
Has, like, an amazing
family energy, no?

38:01.447 --> 38:02.414
It's like a real house.

38:02.449 --> 38:04.851
- Yeah, I mean, it's
82 degrees outside,

38:04.884 --> 38:06.189
so it's pretty warm.

38:06.190 --> 38:07.420
- You know what
I'm talking about.

38:07.454 --> 38:09.255
- So check out
this movie theater.

38:12.324 --> 38:14.793
Insane--I mean, the
sound system in here,

38:14.827 --> 38:16.862
it'll blow your eardrums off.

38:16.896 --> 38:19.331
- I would come in here
and just shut that door

38:19.365 --> 38:20.867
and listen to classical music.

38:20.900 --> 38:22.469
You have all the
options in here.

38:22.501 --> 38:23.635
- Yeah.

38:23.670 --> 38:26.389
I could just see "Pretty
Women" being blasted in here.

38:28.742 --> 38:30.409
- Man, this place is dope.

38:30.443 --> 38:32.679
So this is pretty epic.
He's dope. He's dope.

38:32.711 --> 38:37.416
- "Yo, yo, yo, this is
dope. I am all man.

38:37.449 --> 38:42.222
And me and my buddies
today are in Be-ver-ly Park!"

38:44.456 --> 38:46.458
Yes?

38:46.492 --> 38:47.960
- I got the house for you.

38:48.610 --> 38:49.963
It's in the best gated
community in the country.

38:50.630 --> 38:51.864
And, oh, you want
to go somewhere?

38:51.898 --> 38:55.601
Why don't we hop on your
jet? You got the Scarface tub.

38:55.635 --> 38:57.737
"Say hello to my little friend."

38:57.771 --> 38:58.905
- I think it's dope.

38:58.938 --> 39:00.606
- That's what I'm
talking about, man.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.474
When I first walked
through this house, I was like,

39:02.509 --> 39:03.742
"Man, this place is dope."

39:09.516 --> 39:11.170
- This is really
indoor/outdoor living.

39:11.510 --> 39:13.485
- Mm-hmm. I love the floral.

39:13.519 --> 39:14.788
- Yeah.

39:16.422 --> 39:19.826
- The opportunity to be
in Beverly Park, sub-30,

39:19.858 --> 39:21.494
on an estate this size,

39:21.527 --> 39:24.396
and then the upside on
what could be done here,

39:24.431 --> 39:28.702
I mean, one day, this very well
could be a $45 million house.

39:28.735 --> 39:30.103
So have you guys
been looking around

39:30.135 --> 39:31.771
for a while for the clients?

39:31.804 --> 39:33.940
- Yes. I need to
find something soon.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.942
I want to open an escrow
before the end of the year.

39:36.420 --> 39:37.777
- That's how I feel.

39:37.811 --> 39:39.512
And if you don't open an
escrow per day, it's like a lost day.

39:39.545 --> 39:42.782
- One per day? It's
good to be Fredrik.

39:42.815 --> 39:45.318
[laughter]

39:45.351 --> 39:46.385
<i>- Coming up...</i>

39:46.418 --> 39:49.549
- This is what we're
salvaging. Look at this view.

39:49.550 --> 39:50.389
- It's nice.

39:50.422 --> 39:51.925
- To me, it's not usable.

39:51.958 --> 39:54.927
The land goes all the way down.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.528
- They are looking
for a teardown.

39:56.563 --> 39:59.365
We do have a few other
places we're looking at.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.543
- Hanging out with
the family on Sunday.

40:11.110 --> 40:12.846
Oh, look at that hat, Dad.

40:12.878 --> 40:16.416
- Whoa.
- Daddy, look. I can't see.

40:16.449 --> 40:19.418
- Oh, Lex. Oh, my
God. Who's that?

40:19.452 --> 40:21.887
- Dad.
[laughter]

40:24.623 --> 40:26.326
- I'm not doing anything to you.

40:26.358 --> 40:29.628
- [giggling]

40:29.661 --> 40:31.309
- I'm not doing anything to you.

40:31.639 --> 40:32.431
- I'm not doing anything to you.

40:32.465 --> 40:34.000
- But I'm not doing
anything to you.

40:34.340 --> 40:35.501
- [giggles]

40:54.753 --> 40:57.956
- If you had to be a
raccoon or an iguana,

40:57.990 --> 41:00.460
which would you be, and why?

41:00.492 --> 41:02.461
- Iguana.
- Why?

41:02.494 --> 41:03.596
- I hate raccoons.

41:03.630 --> 41:06.699
- You seem kind of like
a reptile--mysterious girl.

41:10.699 --> 41:12.172
- Can we go back to what
we have to get done today?

41:12.204 --> 41:13.472
- Sure.

41:13.505 --> 41:15.442
I've reached out to
several brokers this week

41:15.474 --> 41:16.909
about the property.

41:16.943 --> 41:18.744
<i>They're all
interested in the land.</i>

41:18.777 --> 41:20.780
My plan is to get this
house sold in a month,

41:20.813 --> 41:22.614
<i>and if that means
showing it to developers,</i>

41:22.648 --> 41:24.150
that's what I'm gonna do.

41:24.184 --> 41:25.485
Jennie?
- Hi.

41:25.518 --> 41:26.920
- Hi. How are you?
- Good to see you.

41:26.952 --> 41:28.454
- You too. Come on in.

41:28.487 --> 41:30.899
- Hi. I'm Claire.
- Nice to meet you.

41:30.900 --> 41:31.690
- I have to run, but
nice to meet you.

41:31.724 --> 41:33.193
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you. Bye, Claire.

41:33.226 --> 41:34.693
- Bye.

41:34.728 --> 41:36.959
- Are you interested in
the house or in the land?

41:36.960 --> 41:38.898
- My clients have been looking
for land in this neighborhood

41:38.931 --> 41:39.833
for a really long time,

41:39.865 --> 41:41.835
but the house seems
kind of interesting,

41:41.867 --> 41:44.737
so while we're here, I
think might as well see both.

41:44.771 --> 41:45.938
- Yeah.

41:47.539 --> 41:48.742
- When was this built?

41:48.775 --> 41:50.510
- 1956.
- Okay.

41:50.543 --> 41:52.512
- Some people like the
mid-century look of it.

41:52.545 --> 41:54.780
I really love old homes,
so I hate to say this,

41:54.813 --> 41:56.159
but I'm not
somebody who will say

41:56.115 --> 41:57.150
"preserve it" if it's ugly.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.585
- Totally.

42:01.221 --> 42:03.757
- We have our living room.

42:05.579 --> 42:05.958
That's what's...

42:06.590 --> 42:08.494
- I see what you're saying.
- Salvageable.

42:08.527 --> 42:10.764
<i>Look, this design
was great in the 1950s.</i>

42:10.797 --> 42:12.431
<i>You have the
lava rock fireplace,</i>

42:12.465 --> 42:14.900
you've got the plants
going in the entryway.

42:14.934 --> 42:17.903
<i>But homes like this are
not appealing to buyers</i>

42:17.936 --> 42:18.938
<i>in today's market.</i>

42:18.972 --> 42:20.206
<i>This house has a tiny kitchen,</i>

42:20.239 --> 42:22.541
<i>low ceilings, and an
awkward floor plan.</i>

42:22.574 --> 42:24.277
<i>You've got a lot of
things that people thought</i>

42:24.309 --> 42:25.811
<i>were really cool back then.</i>

42:25.844 --> 42:27.880
Today, not so much.

42:27.914 --> 42:30.817
And then this is
the main bedroom.

42:30.849 --> 42:33.820
- Oh, I see you
cleaned up for me, Josh.

42:33.853 --> 42:35.221
- Oh, hold on, let
me get my vacuum

42:35.255 --> 42:36.255
out of my Rolls.

42:36.289 --> 42:37.757
- [laughs]

42:37.791 --> 42:39.525
- How goes it?
- Good.

42:39.559 --> 42:42.948
- Okay. Well...
- So this is it.

42:42.949 --> 42:44.764
- We have definitely
something to show you here.

42:44.797 --> 42:45.831
- Yeah.

42:45.864 --> 42:48.768
- And by "show you here,"
I mean the piece of land.

42:48.802 --> 42:50.603
- Perfect. That's what
they're looking for.

42:54.541 --> 42:55.942
- This is what we're salvaging.

42:59.112 --> 43:00.813
Hey, you could
keep the pool, maybe.

43:00.847 --> 43:01.880
- Pool needs to be
redone, probably.

43:01.914 --> 43:03.849
- You can keep the pool
and you can keep the view.

43:03.882 --> 43:06.286
And the Hollywood
sign. And the tree.

43:06.318 --> 43:08.539
- It's nice.
- Look at this view.

43:08.880 --> 43:09.789
- It's nice.
- "It's nice."

43:09.822 --> 43:13.793
- This is what I came
for. This is stunning.

43:14.827 --> 43:16.618
I understand--on the phone,

43:16.619 --> 43:18.130
you told me it was an acre land.

43:18.164 --> 43:18.965
- Yeah, I lied.

43:19.650 --> 43:20.766
I just needed to
get you up here.

43:20.800 --> 43:24.637
But it does feel like an
acre. Let me show you why.

43:24.670 --> 43:27.729
The land is worth
about 3 1/2 now.

43:27.730 --> 43:29.175
If this was
completely flattened,

43:29.208 --> 43:30.909
I mean, I think you've
got a good $4 million,

43:30.943 --> 43:34.179
$4 1/4 million piece of dirt.

43:34.213 --> 43:36.819
<i>Look, you gotta do
what you gotta do</i>

43:36.820 --> 43:37.250
<i>to get the buyers up there.</i>

43:37.282 --> 43:38.985
<i>So you tell a little fib.</i>

43:39.849 --> 43:42.155
Is it in fact half of the
size of what I told her?

43:42.188 --> 43:44.157
Yes. But guess what?

43:44.190 --> 43:46.525
She's happy she's here. It
was worth the trip up here.

43:46.559 --> 43:50.630
- To me, it's not usable. The
land goes all the way down.

43:50.663 --> 43:52.297
It's gonna take a fortune
to build anything on here.

43:52.331 --> 43:53.867
- No, I wouldn't go
beyond the fence point.

43:53.900 --> 43:55.568
I would go up
to right--basically

43:55.601 --> 43:56.902
where I am right here.

43:56.936 --> 43:59.806
And then you build
on top a nice firepit,

43:59.838 --> 44:00.806
with your gorgeous view.

44:00.840 --> 44:01.740
You have to cut that yucca,

44:01.775 --> 44:03.576
because it's in the
middle of your view.

44:03.610 --> 44:05.644
Then, you have--I
mean, God, turn around.

44:05.679 --> 44:07.280
Isn't that magnificent?

44:07.313 --> 44:08.947
- I do love it's so private.

44:09.489 --> 44:12.518
- Isn't that fabulous?
Where are your clients from?

44:12.519 --> 44:13.529
- They're in New York City.

44:13.530 --> 44:14.538
- Yeah, a lot of people

44:14.539 --> 44:16.558
are making the exodus
out of there right now.

44:16.559 --> 44:18.625
- I mean, the number one
thing for them is space and land.

44:18.657 --> 44:21.161
This location has been
kind of top of the list.

44:21.193 --> 44:22.661
- They are looking
for a teardown,

44:22.695 --> 44:24.664
and they're looking
for a large lot.

44:24.697 --> 44:27.669
- Where can you find
almost half an acre

44:27.670 --> 44:30.401
for 3 1/2 million bucks in
LA, especially with a view?

44:30.402 --> 44:31.704
- True, the view is nice.

44:31.737 --> 44:34.907
We do have a few other
places we're looking at.

44:34.940 --> 44:37.768
- Where? That are horrible.

44:37.769 --> 44:40.111
The property is, I want to say,

44:40.112 --> 44:42.148
the largest property on Macapa.

44:42.181 --> 44:43.983
The house is just a bonus.

44:44.840 --> 44:46.686
- I think this is exactly
what they're looking for.

44:46.719 --> 44:48.688
The land, and to be able
to have this much space.

44:48.722 --> 44:49.989
So I'll send it to them.

44:50.900 --> 44:51.224
I'll let you know
what they think.

44:51.257 --> 44:52.692
- I'm gonna reach
out to my clients,

44:52.726 --> 44:53.992
and I'll let you know.
- Perfect.

44:54.940 --> 44:56.596
Tell them to Google Earth it,
and tell them to make an offer.

46:04.396 --> 46:06.398

something. Right?

46:06.432 --> 46:08.802
- No offense, but people
have done a virtual tour before.

46:08.835 --> 46:11.838
We have to do something that
engages people and make them

46:11.871 --> 46:13.873
really feel like they're
here with the two of us.

46:34.940 --> 46:36.329
I have one style,
he has one style,

46:36.362 --> 46:39.649

they can vote at the end.

46:39.650 --> 46:40.666
- Can we do that?
- Or pick their favorites?

46:40.699 --> 46:42.369

where people can vote, right?

46:42.402 --> 46:44.371

that in the comments and stuff.

to be number one.

However, with Fredrik, I
don't see him as competition.
