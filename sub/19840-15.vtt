00:00.001 --> 00:02.634
<i>Previously on</i> Greenleaf...

00:02.636 --> 00:04.035
I just think
you should calm down

00:04.038 --> 00:05.704
on the groupies
at the cotillion.

00:05.705 --> 00:07.539
- Isaiah.
- Get off!

00:07.541 --> 00:11.577
I promise you I will
never do this again.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.112
<i>Excuse me, First Lady?</i>

00:13.114 --> 00:15.481
- Yes?
- I meant First Lady Skanks.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.416
When Kerissa and I
were doing Real Church,

00:17.418 --> 00:19.418
we met some amazing people,

00:19.420 --> 00:21.020
<i>and we need them here.</i>

00:21.022 --> 00:23.022
Creating new programs
at a time like this?

00:23.024 --> 00:25.424
It may be better to wait on
your Real Church integration.

00:25.426 --> 00:28.160
Tamela Mann asked me
to sing backup for her.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.295
I do not want to see you

00:30.297 --> 00:32.131
throw away your dignity.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.666
- Mama!
- The one good thing about your mother

00:34.668 --> 00:36.135
leaving us the way she did.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.070
She knew about you, too.
All of them.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.072
<i>I could have ended my marriage.</i>

00:40.074 --> 00:43.108
You are <i> disgusting.</i>

00:43.110 --> 00:45.344
Tell Mae I'm sorry.

00:48.182 --> 00:51.083
<i>EnchantÃ©, madame.</i>

00:52.219 --> 00:53.519
<i>Monsieur.</i>

01:19.580 --> 01:21.814
Wow!

01:21.816 --> 01:23.515
Wow, look at you two.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.317
Still got it, Daddy?

01:25.319 --> 01:27.486
Well, time hasn't
taken everything.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.288
Mama, take a look at these two.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.156
- Yes.
- Astaire and Rogers, right?

01:31.158 --> 01:34.326
Yes, just poetry in motion.

01:34.328 --> 01:37.262
Wow. All right, baby.
All right, all right.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.630
You're gonna be late for school.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.833
Fine, I guess I'll go to school.

01:40.835 --> 01:42.301
Come on, come on, come on.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.769
Practice again tonight?

01:43.771 --> 01:45.871
Only two weeks until cotillion.

01:45.873 --> 01:48.474
Anytime you want to dance,
you just tell me?

01:48.476 --> 01:50.242
I'm there.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.211
You two should join a dance club

01:52.213 --> 01:53.245
or something, Grandma.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.346
<i>He's good!</i>

01:54.348 --> 01:58.183
Don't you know I know it.

01:58.185 --> 02:01.487
- No, dear, I just wanted...
- Go, go, go.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.856
Maricel called
early this morning

02:03.858 --> 02:07.893
and she's in the hospital
with Quico.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.429
- Well, what happened?
- Meningitis.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.164
- What?
- Is he going to be okay?

02:12.166 --> 02:13.799
Thankfully, yes.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.300
But she's not going
to be here today

02:15.302 --> 02:17.603
and possibly not for the week.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.771
But isn't she supposed
to go on tour with Charity

02:19.773 --> 02:21.140
- starting Friday?
- Well.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.841
Well, that was Satan's plan,

02:22.843 --> 02:25.677
but seems like
the Lord has intervened.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.613
Can't we just keep
Nathan with us?

02:27.615 --> 02:28.814
Help out for two weeks?

02:28.816 --> 02:30.482
This is for the best.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.684
She's staying home now,
and don't help.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.219
I think she should go.

02:34.221 --> 02:36.355
- Excuse me?
- I think Gigi's right.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.756
We should all chip in.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.324
You gonna pitch in with a baby?

02:39.326 --> 02:40.659
Or pay someone else to.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.628
And who'll lead
praise and worship?

02:42.630 --> 02:43.662
Charity said Carlton can do it.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.930
- Carlton?
- Yeah.

02:44.932 --> 02:47.499
I don't have
a problem with that.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.168
Is that a problem for you?

02:49.170 --> 02:50.569
- James?
- You see,

02:50.571 --> 02:52.538
we're just trying
to give your daughter

02:52.540 --> 02:55.240
the same access
to her own happiness

02:55.242 --> 02:57.843
that you've taken so freely
for yourself over the years.

03:04.351 --> 03:07.452
Well, I tell you what.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.454
Charity and I will go

03:09.456 --> 03:11.957
and visit them both
in the hospital this morning

03:11.959 --> 03:14.459
and get a better sense
of the situation.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.461
Brilliant idea.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.397
Yes, because what is the sense

03:18.399 --> 03:19.798
in trying to make decisions

03:19.800 --> 03:21.200
when we don't know what the hell

03:21.202 --> 03:22.901
we're talking about.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.589
Bishop?

04:18.591 --> 04:19.958
Yes, Karine?

04:19.959 --> 04:22.461
Miss Cross is here to see you.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.695
Marvelous.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.030
Send her in.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.999
I was praying
for some distraction.

04:27.001 --> 04:28.600
Well, here I am.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.035
Karine, you can go now.
Thank you.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.803
Open or...?

04:31.805 --> 04:33.538
Closed will be fine, thank you.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.280
In all seriousness,
I hope I'm not

04:41.282 --> 04:42.381
interrupting anything.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.383
I see you have
your big Bible open.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.851
I was just preparing
some thoughts

04:45.853 --> 04:47.519
for my message on Sunday.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.754
What are you preaching on?

04:48.756 --> 04:50.922
Well, the text
is the story of the Flood,

04:50.924 --> 04:52.457
but I'm still waiting to see

04:52.459 --> 04:54.493
what I'm gonna be preaching.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.428
The Lord hasn't
revealed that to me yet.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.664
Well, I'm sure
you'll find something

04:58.666 --> 04:59.731
to shake the walls.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.867
You always do.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.770
- May I?
- Make yourself at home.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.738
Thank you.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.874
So, to what do I...

05:08.876 --> 05:10.742
owe this surprise?

05:12.313 --> 05:14.579
Well...

05:14.581 --> 05:16.948
I wanted to stop
and drop this by.

05:19.386 --> 05:22.087
Well... What's this for?

05:22.089 --> 05:26.591
You put good things out, good
things come back, right?

05:26.593 --> 05:30.028
Well, at least
we hope they do, right?

05:34.702 --> 05:36.401
Is there some sort of problem?

05:36.403 --> 05:37.536
You know me, don't you?

05:37.538 --> 05:38.837
Everyone else in my life

05:38.839 --> 05:41.640
thinks of me as the, you know,

05:41.642 --> 05:45.777
every hair in place, but you
see through all of that.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.513
It's nice, actually,
having someone

05:48.515 --> 05:49.915
who sees the real me.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.884
I'm sure you have that with Mae.

05:57.624 --> 06:00.125
What's this big check
really about?

06:01.762 --> 06:04.463
Nothing, hopefully.

06:04.465 --> 06:08.066
I went and had

06:08.068 --> 06:12.371
my fiveyear cancer
screening the other day.

06:13.774 --> 06:17.709
And this morning,
they asked me to come in.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.145
That's not
necessarily a bad thing.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.948
No, but usually when it's good,

06:22.950 --> 06:26.752
they give you
the results over the phone.

06:26.754 --> 06:29.121
- So, we'll see.
- When's this big appointment?

06:29.123 --> 06:30.489
10:00.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.624
I was actually headed that way.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.459
Might I accompany you?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.562
You sure you're not too busy?

06:37.564 --> 06:38.997
No.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.735
I'll be back
in a couple of hours.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.903
Okay?

06:48.876 --> 06:50.442
So, what brings you by, Skip?

06:50.444 --> 06:52.611
You just happen to be
in the hood?

06:52.613 --> 06:54.846
No.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.748
No one knows this yet,

06:56.750 --> 06:59.084
but the mayor is stepping
down at the end of this term,

06:59.086 --> 07:01.920
and I'm gonna be running.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.890
- Mayor Leonard.
- Could be.

07:04.892 --> 07:10.028
Anyway, Basie was gonna be
my spiritual advisor.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.731
You know, support me publicly,

07:12.733 --> 07:13.799
sit by my right hand,

07:13.801 --> 07:15.767
make sure the community knows

07:15.769 --> 07:17.736
I'm God's man in Memphis.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.871
Okay.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.707
He didn't mention this
to you before he... pyew.

07:22.709 --> 07:23.975
No.

07:25.946 --> 07:29.514
Anyway, I just
dropped by to find out

07:29.516 --> 07:32.117
if I can count on Triumph.

07:32.119 --> 07:36.788
- Triumph?
- The handsome, fresh face of Triumph.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.191
Could be mutually beneficial.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.829
Say what you want
about church and state,

07:43.831 --> 07:46.598
but there's a lot of overlap.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.068
What kind of overlap
are we talking?

07:50.070 --> 07:52.971
Well, like, there's all kinds
of community development

07:52.973 --> 07:54.673
block grants.

07:54.675 --> 07:58.477
Programs like this
homeless thing of yours.

07:58.479 --> 08:01.813
People love to hate
on the government nowadays,

08:01.815 --> 08:04.649
but there's a lot of cash
waiting to be claimed.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.821
Well, I tell you what.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.890
I'll pray on it.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.693
Wouldn't have it any other way.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.194
And in the meantime,
you can send over

08:16.196 --> 08:18.797
any stuff you have for me
to take a look at.

08:18.799 --> 08:22.501
You know, any position
papers, policies.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.135
Just to be sure
we're on the same page.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.005
- Thank you for the time.
- Thank you.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.648
I can't believe
you're doing this.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.549
Charity, I'm not doing anything.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.150
You won't let me take Maricel

08:40.153 --> 08:42.554
after we agreed
it was going to be okay.

08:42.556 --> 08:43.822
That was before her husband

08:43.823 --> 08:45.557
was parked outside death's door.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.792
They said
he's gonna be fine, Mama.

08:47.794 --> 08:49.127
He's going home
in a couple of days.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.195
He's through
the worst of it, Mama.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.097
That's what the doctor said.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.566
The doctor said it would take two
weeks for him to fully recover.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.101
But you know
that is not the plan.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.969
The answer is no.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.709
Thank you
for coming with me today.

09:04.711 --> 09:05.711
Of course.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.681
It actually gave me some ideas

09:09.683 --> 09:12.217
about my message on Sunday.

09:12.219 --> 09:15.854
Well, feel free to share.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.823
I'd rather think about
almost anything else.

09:18.825 --> 09:23.562
Well, I was thinking about
the animals on Noah's ark.

09:23.564 --> 09:26.598
How all the animals entered
the ark two by two.

09:29.136 --> 09:33.672
How God made us
to need each other.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.840
Well, I need you today.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.278
Even if it didn't occur
to me to ask.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.681
Miss Cross?

09:42.683 --> 09:44.950
Yeah, go on.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.598
Mama?

09:59.600 --> 10:04.836
- You wanted to see me?
- I did... I do... I mean... yes.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.075
Well, what's up?

10:11.345 --> 10:13.812
Maricel's husband is illegal.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.347
I think you mean undocumented.

10:15.349 --> 10:16.982
I'm just trying to help, Grace.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.317
All right, go ahead. Sorry.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.387
Well, the reason
that he just waited so long

10:22.389 --> 10:24.756
and let himself get so sick
before he went to a hospital

10:24.758 --> 10:26.358
was he was afraid.

10:26.360 --> 10:30.295
Scared that he'd be, you know,
sniffed out or deported.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.631
- Can you imagine?
- No, I can't.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.200
I don't want to, and
that's why I'm asking you

10:35.202 --> 10:37.335
if we can do something
to help him get...

10:37.337 --> 10:39.137
- Documented.
- Yeah, yes.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.672
Is there any way we can get this

10:40.674 --> 10:41.806
on the fast track?

10:41.808 --> 10:44.009
Because if I had
to give up Maricel

10:44.011 --> 10:47.779
on top of everything else,
I just don't know.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.348
I'll see what I can do.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.117
Mama?

10:54.287 --> 10:58.289
- Is something wrong between you and Daddy?
- Yes.

10:58.291 --> 11:02.060
But you take care of that
because that will give me

11:02.062 --> 11:06.898
the joy that I need to persist.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.772
- Good morning, Karine.
- Good morning.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.779
Where's Bishop?

11:20.781 --> 11:22.781
With Miss Cross.

11:29.756 --> 11:31.156
- Hey.
- All clear.

11:31.158 --> 11:34.192
- Praise God.
- I know. Thank you.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.328
So, why did they want
to see you?

11:37.330 --> 11:39.898
Just some kidney stuff they want
to keep, you know, eyes on.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.399
No big deal.

11:41.401 --> 11:45.170
I'm sure it's just an
aftereffect of the chemo.

11:45.172 --> 11:48.406
- But I'm cancerfree.
- I knew you would be.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.177
You know, my daughter
Gigi tells me that I...

11:52.179 --> 11:55.480
I shouldn't tell folk
that, but I knew it.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.718
I'm so glad that God

11:59.720 --> 12:01.152
decided to put you in my life.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.888
And thank you for being open

12:03.890 --> 12:05.423
to letting Him do that.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.991
Well...

12:09.429 --> 12:11.096
I'm happy to be of service.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.365
So, you want to go to dinner

12:14.367 --> 12:16.901
or have a light drink
to celebrate?

12:16.903 --> 12:19.471
- You know?
- Um, I...

12:19.473 --> 12:22.974
- Should be getting back.
- I probably should.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.176
I know, it was silly to ask.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.779
I've been hogging you all day and
want you for the nighttime, too?

12:27.781 --> 12:29.914
Who am I? One of many, I'm sure.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.050
Come on.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.852
Okay. Best be getting you back.

12:33.854 --> 12:37.055
You have a sermon
to write, mister.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.289
It'll just be two weeks.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.158
<i>Yeah, but two weeks
is two weeks.</i>

12:40.160 --> 12:41.826
But I'll learn the parts.
You know that.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.161
<i>And who's going
to sing them till then?</i>

12:43.163 --> 12:45.096
<i>I'll have to hire
somebody to cover.</i>

12:45.098 --> 12:47.232
Right, but just for two weeks,

12:47.234 --> 12:49.200
and then I can come
meet up with the tour.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.136
It... <i>-But the money</i>
I'll have to spend

12:51.138 --> 12:52.437
<i>for someone to rehearse...</i>

12:52.439 --> 12:53.905
<i>Charity, for you,
I'd spend extra,</i>

12:53.907 --> 12:55.340
<i>but it's not just me.</i>

12:55.342 --> 12:58.009
<i>It's the promoters,
Tamela's people.</i>

12:58.011 --> 12:59.377
<i>It's okay just not to do it.</i>

12:59.379 --> 13:01.045
<i>- We'll have other chances.</i>
- No!

13:01.047 --> 13:02.447
I'll make it work.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.949
<i>It's really okay
to say you can't.</i>

13:04.951 --> 13:07.318
I'll make it work. Okay?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.020
I'll see you Friday
for rehearsal.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.822
<i>I'll see you Friday.</i>

13:10.824 --> 13:12.023
Bye.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.573
Z!

13:28.575 --> 13:30.375
Mom!

13:30.377 --> 13:32.510
One sec. Just give me a minute.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.147
- Yes?
- What were you doing?

13:36.149 --> 13:38.449
I was folding laundry.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.823
You can help.
Just grab some underwear.

13:44.825 --> 13:48.493
So, what's the big emergency?

13:48.495 --> 13:50.595
Well, there's no big emergency,

13:50.597 --> 13:53.565
but Mr. Dorsey came to
see me about you today.

13:53.567 --> 13:57.936
Why? I'm pulling a B
average, or near that.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.939
It wasn't about your grades.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.473
He says you're not
participating.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.210
It's 'cause
he's a great teacher.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.078
Getting it all in here.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.347
Are you sure
there's nothing wrong?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.950
Yes, I'm sure.

14:11.952 --> 14:15.920
I'm as good as it gets.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.491
Are you sure, Zora?

14:20.493 --> 14:23.628
Mom, you're being weird.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.598
I wear a longsleeve, and you
have a problem with it.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.334
Then I used to get grief
for talking too much,

14:29.336 --> 14:32.337
and now, apparently,
I don't talk enough.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.972
I'm maturing.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.173
- Maturing?
- Yeah.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.307
I'm becoming serious.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.949
Okay, well, clean up.

14:44.951 --> 14:46.517
That's what I was doing
before you rang.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.222
Mwah.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.662
I'll unlock it.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.104
Gosh, have you seen my earring?

15:06.106 --> 15:07.338
Yeah.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.208
Here you go.

15:10.210 --> 15:13.011
- Thank you.
- Wow, good hands.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.946
- Nice.
- Nice everything.

15:14.948 --> 15:18.116
Ooh.

15:20.654 --> 15:22.687
I'm sorry
I can't stay the night,

15:22.689 --> 15:24.989
but, you know, Sophia.

15:24.991 --> 15:27.292
Nah, that's cool.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.993
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:28.995 --> 15:33.231
I mean, I... I obviously
wish you could stay.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.566
- Yeah.
- But I get it.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.936
Is she okay with me
coming to dinner tomorrow?

15:37.938 --> 15:39.671
Yeah, she is.

15:39.673 --> 15:41.205
But?

15:42.609 --> 15:46.144
I just wonder if we
should go out somewhere.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.146
You know? Just the three of us.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.954
Isn't normalizing
this whole thing

15:55.956 --> 15:58.489
with your family...

15:58.491 --> 16:02.160
- you know, kind of the point?
- Well, yeah.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.695
- Yeah.
- Come here.

16:03.697 --> 16:08.666
- But...
- Okay, but what?

16:10.270 --> 16:13.304
- No, it's just...
- What? Say it.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.073
My parents.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.109
Something's going on with them.

16:19.612 --> 16:22.647
Well, I mean, they can
fight in front of me.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.116
- Yeah?
- Yeah, my parents did it all the time.

16:25.118 --> 16:28.286
Lasted 24 years, that marriage.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.288
Well, we'll see.

16:30.290 --> 16:34.325
I just don't know if it's the right
time to "cross the streams."

16:34.327 --> 16:37.495
- You know?
- Well, whatever, I'm down.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.766
Thank you.

16:47.607 --> 16:50.041
For being perfect.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.680
And thank you for being you.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.551
Good evening.

17:06.792 --> 17:09.394
You saw Miss Cross today.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.396
As a matter of fact, I did.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.436
She was off to get the results

17:19.439 --> 17:22.140
from her fiveyear
cancer screening

17:22.142 --> 17:24.275
and needed
some spiritual support.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.210
I see.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.483
As to the compassionate question

17:32.485 --> 17:35.386
that your suspicion
prevents you from asking,

17:35.388 --> 17:36.621
she's fine.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.456
She also brought us a check.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.058
Did Karine tell you that, too?

17:40.060 --> 17:41.659
- She did.
- Good.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.428
I'd hate to think
that you were being denied

17:43.430 --> 17:45.063
any crucial information.

17:50.804 --> 17:52.403
Good night.

17:57.811 --> 17:59.744
What did Zora
have to say about Dorsey?

17:59.746 --> 18:02.113
Just what you'd expect.

18:02.115 --> 18:04.482
But when I went to go see her,
her room was locked.

18:04.484 --> 18:05.650
She was acting very strange.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.218
Maybe she was high.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.619
You don't think
she's doing that.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.488
I was at that age.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.591
I'm not saying it was good,
but that's how it was.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.127
It didn't smell like marijuana.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.562
Maybe it was edibles.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.263
Well, listen to you, Bob Marley.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.332
I'm just going off
what you said.

18:21.334 --> 18:24.368
Skip Leonard
shouldn't trust you.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.704
Just, um...

18:26.706 --> 18:28.439
bring me back some
if you find some.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.141
Not with you. I cannot.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.610
You are terrible.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.896
What are you doing in my stuff?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.500
What are you doing with this?

19:34.374 --> 19:36.774
Kevin's gone.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.776
He's not coming back.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.779
Yeah, it looks like that,
doesn't it?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.614
I have to get on with my life.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.815
And you have
the right to do that.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.951
Even if I am partly doing this

19:46.953 --> 19:49.220
to be with Jabari?

19:49.222 --> 19:50.421
Daddy, what's wrong with that?

19:50.423 --> 19:52.190
People like other people.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.525
I think your mother's
just worried.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.894
I know she is,
but, Daddy, it's my life.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.263
When I'm standing
on that stage singing

19:59.265 --> 20:02.967
and the spirit of God
falls on me...

20:05.338 --> 20:06.671
I can't explain.

20:06.673 --> 20:09.607
It's... it's life.

20:09.609 --> 20:12.243
And I know I'm just singing
background on this tour,

20:12.245 --> 20:15.613
but I don't want
to just sing at Calvary.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.915
I want to sing to the nations.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.917
And this is a step toward that.

20:19.919 --> 20:23.921
I mean, she is playing
Madison Square Garden.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.890
Then you have to do that.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.427
I know I'm leaving you
in a lurch

20:29.429 --> 20:30.861
when it comes to worship, Daddy,

20:30.863 --> 20:35.633
and I'm sorry,
but Carlton is available.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.535
And all you have to do
is go over and ask.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.670
Whatever Mama
or Betty Wilcox thinks...

20:39.672 --> 20:41.505
That's a whole nother
can of worms.

20:41.507 --> 20:42.907
But what about Nathan?

20:42.909 --> 20:44.508
I'll make it work.

20:44.510 --> 20:45.943
I can't be the first woman

20:45.945 --> 20:47.878
to bring her baby
on tour with her,

20:47.880 --> 20:50.414
so we'll figure it out.

20:52.485 --> 20:53.551
What?

20:55.521 --> 20:56.821
I'm just proud of you.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.723
Don't worry about
leading worship.

20:58.725 --> 20:59.924
I'll take care of that.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.959
I'll handle it.

21:01.961 --> 21:02.961
You just go.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.468
- I love you.
- Love you back.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.375
How could you be
so irresponsible?

21:17.377 --> 21:19.043
I mean, we were
using protection.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.612
That's the definition
of responsible.

21:23.549 --> 21:25.616
I knew that boy was no good.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.653
- It was my decision.
- And it was stupid!

21:28.655 --> 21:31.656
When are you going to learn
that I'm not like you?

21:31.658 --> 21:32.923
I'm not you.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.293
I don't want you to be me.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.528
I want you to be you, Zora.

21:37.530 --> 21:40.464
But I want you to be the
best you that you can be.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.300
And this is not it.

21:42.302 --> 21:45.503
I know you think
I'm uptight and uncool

21:45.505 --> 21:46.937
and the opposite of lit

21:46.939 --> 21:48.706
or whatever it is you kids
are saying these days,

21:48.708 --> 21:50.508
but I can tell you this.

21:50.510 --> 21:53.577
Making your father wait
until we were married

21:53.579 --> 21:55.012
earned me his respect.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.014
Did it?

22:04.357 --> 22:05.690
Zora?

22:06.859 --> 22:09.727
I'm sorry.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.366
Sweetie, look at me.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.569
Look at me.

22:21.074 --> 22:24.809
All I'm saying is that

22:24.811 --> 22:27.678
there's a lot of sex to be had,

22:27.680 --> 22:30.414
but it's never a measure
of a woman's worth.

22:30.416 --> 22:32.683
I need you to understand that.

22:35.421 --> 22:38.055
You are young and smart

22:38.057 --> 22:40.391
and of much value.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.094
Are you gonna tell Dad?

22:43.096 --> 22:45.730
I don't know.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.599
I don't know what
I'm gonna do yet.

22:52.071 --> 22:53.404
But in the meantime,

22:53.406 --> 22:55.473
that boy is not to be
in this house

22:55.475 --> 22:58.809
ever again, end of story.

22:58.811 --> 23:02.747
And I want you to read
Corinthians chapter seven.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.566
Now, the strong housing

23:22.568 --> 23:24.668
and job training initiatives

23:24.670 --> 23:27.171
in the second and third
phase of this plan

23:27.173 --> 23:30.941
are built on the foundation
of phase one's focus.

23:30.943 --> 23:34.912
Regular church attendance,
which starts with busing.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.047
- Pastor Greenleaf?
- Sister Weaver.

23:37.049 --> 23:39.683
When were you thinking about
setting all this in motion?

23:39.685 --> 23:41.886
As soon as possible, I hope.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.654
This Sunday?

23:43.656 --> 23:46.757
Well, as treasurer, it falls
to me, unfortunately,

23:46.759 --> 23:48.926
to talk about the
financial realities here.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.494
We already have the buses

23:50.496 --> 23:53.431
and we can get volunteers
to drive them.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.499
I mean, so for phase one,
we're literally

23:55.501 --> 23:56.967
just talking about
the cost of gas.

23:56.969 --> 24:00.171
- And insurance.
- And insurance.

24:00.173 --> 24:02.072
For the drivers and passengers.

24:02.074 --> 24:05.876
- That's correct.
- Which is no small thing.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.545
Plus, when Pastor Skanks

24:07.547 --> 24:09.747
launched his Open
and Inclusive Coalition,

24:09.749 --> 24:12.149
we gained four new members total

24:12.151 --> 24:14.585
and lost 200 old ones.

24:14.587 --> 24:15.953
Now you're talking
about bringing in

24:15.955 --> 24:17.955
potentially an even
less desirable element,

24:17.957 --> 24:19.557
which, by definition,
will cost us

24:19.559 --> 24:21.959
more money,
and don't add a dime?

24:21.961 --> 24:26.630
- Sister Weaver...
- Pastor Greenleaf, I'm not the one who's in charge.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.833
The money's in charge.

24:28.835 --> 24:31.669
No, the Lord is in charge.

24:33.105 --> 24:35.873
And He told me the
city's gonna pay for it.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.743
All in favor, say aye.

24:39.745 --> 24:41.745
Aye.

24:41.747 --> 24:43.147
- Aye.
- Aye.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.648
Aye.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.689
I had a talk with Charity today.

24:51.691 --> 24:54.859
Tell me that she has
made her peace, please.

24:54.861 --> 24:58.796
Well, I'd say she has.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.764
She's going on tour.

25:02.702 --> 25:05.503
And Carlton's coming back
to lead worship.

25:05.505 --> 25:07.271
- Says who?
- Me.

25:07.273 --> 25:11.108
- I'm gonna talk to him about it tomorrow.
- Well...

25:11.110 --> 25:14.245
And like everything else
in your family,

25:14.247 --> 25:16.280
it's not a conversation.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.120
What's in the box?

25:23.122 --> 25:25.856
Just a little something
for your boyfriend.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.559
Really? Look at you.

25:30.897 --> 25:32.730
Look at you. Such a girl.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.198
This is not gonna be one big

25:34.200 --> 25:36.267
teaseyourmomabout-
herboyfriend night, okay?

25:36.269 --> 25:37.868
I don't know what it's gonna be.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.603
Okay, he's here.

25:42.275 --> 25:43.807
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:43.809 --> 25:45.543
- Good evening.
- Good evening. Come on in.

25:45.545 --> 25:47.311
Thank you, ma'am.

25:49.649 --> 25:51.115
Excellent help you have there.

25:51.117 --> 25:54.585
We aim to please.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.620
Sophia, you remember Mr. Nash.

25:56.622 --> 25:58.889
From the night
of the car accident.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.858
Yes, that's right.

26:00.860 --> 26:03.127
Well, look at you
with all these flowers?

26:03.129 --> 26:04.562
Yeah, they're for your mother.

26:04.564 --> 26:07.164
And this is for you.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.301
- Thank you.
- You're thoughtful.

26:10.303 --> 26:11.869
And this is for you.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.908
I thought music
would be a safe bet.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.644
- Totally.
- What is this?

26:20.646 --> 26:22.780
A playlist. Great minds.

26:22.782 --> 26:24.748
Yeah? What kind of music?

26:24.750 --> 26:28.185
All kinds of gospel,
contemporary.

26:28.187 --> 26:31.956
Okay, cool. Thank you.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.792
Well, you ready to go get raked
over the coals for doing your job?

26:34.794 --> 26:37.595
There's still
gonna be food, right?

26:37.597 --> 26:39.296
- There's gonna be food.
- Okay.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.765
We're gonna take care of you
in that department, okay?

26:41.767 --> 26:43.634
I see chocolate cake.

26:52.878 --> 26:55.613
Before we go
into this breakfast...-

26:55.615 --> 26:57.047
I just want to dial in
the message.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.049
- Of course.
- Jesus, great.

26:59.051 --> 27:01.785
Church, great. Homeless, great.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.722
Brother Leonard, God's man
in Memphis, even better.

27:04.724 --> 27:07.091
Okay, I think I can do that.

27:07.093 --> 27:11.328
Just maybe lay off
the, you know...

27:11.330 --> 27:13.130
The gay stuff.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.165
- Seriously?
- Just for this morning.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.101
I'm cool with it.
I'm more than cool with it.

27:17.103 --> 27:19.003
But some of these cats...

27:20.673 --> 27:22.773
Stick to the common ground.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.341
Inclusivity is what we do here.

27:24.343 --> 27:27.945
Pastor, if these guys get
me into the mayor's office,

27:27.947 --> 27:29.913
and they're the ones
that can do it,

27:29.915 --> 27:32.082
those block grants will be
rolling in so fast,

27:32.084 --> 27:34.151
you'll have to swim
to keep from drowning

27:34.153 --> 27:35.753
in all that money.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.154
Amen?

27:37.156 --> 27:39.089
One mountain at a time.

27:46.365 --> 27:47.931
Okay.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.268
See you in there, preacher man.

27:57.109 --> 28:00.377
Here's my father in a nutshell.

28:00.379 --> 28:02.346
Atlanta City Council
was trying to prove

28:02.348 --> 28:06.050
they didn't have to pass any
more laws to desegregate.

28:06.052 --> 28:08.919
This was back in the 1960s.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.422
My father gave a passionate
speech that threatened to change

28:11.424 --> 28:13.357
all their minds.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.893
My uncle says it's
some of the finest words

28:15.895 --> 28:18.262
he's ever heard
outside of pulpit.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.864
He sounds like a remarkable man.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.733
Too bad he's passed.

28:22.735 --> 28:26.270
So, now, what church
did your parents attend?

28:26.272 --> 28:30.140
First Presbyterian.

28:30.142 --> 28:32.242
Is your mother still alive?

28:32.244 --> 28:36.380
No, my parents were one of
those couples you hear about.

28:36.382 --> 28:40.117
My father passed away and my
mother passed shortly thereafter

28:40.119 --> 28:42.186
just a few days later.

28:42.188 --> 28:45.889
- Aw, that's beautiful.
- Isn't it?

28:45.891 --> 28:48.192
To have a bond like that
with another person.

28:48.194 --> 28:50.160
Yes.

28:50.162 --> 28:52.196
I can't imagine.

28:59.038 --> 29:01.238
Well...

29:01.240 --> 29:03.207
I think we should
probably move inside

29:03.209 --> 29:06.510
because I have a feeling
that roast is ready.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.746
Yeah.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.487
You were great tonight.

29:16.489 --> 29:18.922
- Thank you.
- You were.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.427
Something is up
with your parents, though.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.131
Yeah.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.867
- Yeah.
- You have no idea what?

29:29.869 --> 29:31.335
I have no idea.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.771
I've never seen them
like this before.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.473
Something tells me
it's gonna get worse

29:36.475 --> 29:38.509
before it gets better, but...

29:42.982 --> 29:44.815
Thank you.

29:44.817 --> 29:46.450
Thank you for coming.

29:47.887 --> 29:49.820
It was my pleasure.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.500
Hello?

30:04.804 --> 30:06.170
Hey, baby.

30:06.172 --> 30:07.805
Where are you?

30:07.807 --> 30:09.573
- Nikki said that...
- Never mind what Nikki said.

30:09.575 --> 30:12.176
It's... it's better
you don't know where I'm at.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.878
Basie, baby, just come back.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.281
Yeah...

30:17.283 --> 30:18.882
that's not the plan.

30:18.884 --> 30:20.951
I'm never gonna see you
again, am I?

30:23.823 --> 30:25.289
I'm never gonna see you.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.591
<i>Just tell me you love me.</i>

30:29.528 --> 30:31.929
- I love you.
<i>- That's my girl.</i>

30:31.931 --> 30:33.297
<i>Don't trust them, baby.</i>

30:33.299 --> 30:34.832
<i>They conned us out of our church</i>

30:34.834 --> 30:36.834
<i>and they murdered my father.</i>

30:36.836 --> 30:40.437
Tasha, baby, when it comes
to the Greenleafs...

30:40.439 --> 30:43.307
<i>- Yes, Basie?</i>
- Make them pay.

30:45.477 --> 30:47.477
I will.

30:47.479 --> 30:49.279
I will, I promise.

30:50.850 --> 30:53.317
Ulrick is the best
immigration lawyer

30:53.319 --> 30:55.252
in Memphis, bar none.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.454
You are too kind, Rochelle.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.389
Rochelle knows everybody.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.491
She's the one who got
Sophia and Zora

31:01.493 --> 31:03.360
into the cotillion
after all that mixup.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.162
Yes, I remember.

31:05.164 --> 31:08.131
So, tell me about
this gentleman's story.

31:12.938 --> 31:17.174
Yes, well, the husband
of our housekeeper Maricel,

31:17.176 --> 31:19.209
he came from Honduras
with absolutely nothing

31:19.211 --> 31:22.112
and he worked his way
from dishwasher

31:22.114 --> 31:23.981
all the way up to head chef.

31:23.983 --> 31:26.116
And let me guess,
when he was a dishwasher,

31:26.118 --> 31:29.086
they paid him in cash,
and once he became a chef,

31:29.088 --> 31:30.387
they could no longer
pay him off the books,

31:30.389 --> 31:32.189
so he made up his own
social security number.

31:32.191 --> 31:36.159
Exactly, and he paid taxes
with that number for years.

31:36.161 --> 31:38.595
But then last month,
he nearly died

31:38.597 --> 31:40.564
staying away from the
hospital with meningitis

31:40.566 --> 31:43.233
because he was afraid
they would report him.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.335
In this new climate of ours.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.237
We just want
to get him documented

31:47.239 --> 31:49.072
before it really
becomes a problem.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.607
We'll pay your fee.
Full freight.

31:50.609 --> 31:54.411
Ulrick, please.

31:54.413 --> 31:58.515
Well, you know, these two
are a onetwo punch.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.600
Good afternoon.

32:17.937 --> 32:20.604
Bishop Greenleaf,
good afternoon.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.241
You got a minute to talk?

32:24.243 --> 32:25.375
I do.

32:27.579 --> 32:30.380
Charity's going on tour for a
few months with Tamela Mann.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.548
I'm aware.

32:31.550 --> 32:34.451
Now, we're all
very happy for her.

32:34.453 --> 32:37.287
But it leaves us without a
director for our music ministry.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.290
You haven't found a replacement?

32:40.292 --> 32:42.326
No.

32:42.328 --> 32:44.094
I was wondering
if you'd consider

32:44.096 --> 32:45.495
coming back to join us,

32:45.497 --> 32:48.365
with full benefits of course.

32:48.367 --> 32:51.301
- What as?
- What do you mean, "what as"?

32:51.303 --> 32:53.737
I mean, what as?

32:53.739 --> 32:55.973
As a friend of the court?
As your pet homosexual?

32:55.975 --> 32:57.574
As who you are!

32:58.677 --> 33:01.178
Doing what you do best.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.013
Putting your gifts
into the service

33:03.015 --> 33:04.381
of our most holy Lord.

33:04.383 --> 33:06.750
You still don't get it.

33:06.752 --> 33:09.219
No, I guess I don't. What?

33:09.221 --> 33:10.587
I am not interested
in coming back

33:10.589 --> 33:14.658
as the exception,
even a beloved one.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.426
Now, until Calvary
can join Triumph

33:16.428 --> 33:19.062
in being open and inclusive,

33:19.064 --> 33:21.231
I won't be coming back.

33:21.233 --> 33:23.533
I actually can't.

33:23.535 --> 33:27.304
The man I love won't let me.

33:30.009 --> 33:32.142
Two by two.

33:32.144 --> 33:35.212
What's that, Bishop?

33:35.214 --> 33:38.115
The Lord just finally gave
me my message for Sunday.

33:38.117 --> 33:40.584
It's crazy how that happens.

33:40.586 --> 33:43.420
- Listen...
- Now, don't tell me the church will change quicker

33:43.422 --> 33:45.655
if I'm in there getting beat up.

33:45.657 --> 33:48.358
I've already heard that.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.627
The church isn't mine to fix.

33:50.629 --> 33:53.296
No, brother!

33:53.298 --> 33:56.066
But the world is.

33:56.068 --> 33:58.335
The church can still
change the world

33:58.337 --> 34:01.805
in a way that only
the church can.

34:01.807 --> 34:04.674
That was good, shorty.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.178
Will you think about it?

34:08.179 --> 34:10.380
Let's do it together.

34:17.121 --> 34:18.155
I'll do it.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.761
- God bless you.
- Thank you, Bishop.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.770
Yeah!

36:15.574 --> 36:19.709
Let's hear it for our special
guest, Joshua Nelson,

36:19.711 --> 36:21.778
and our very own
minister of music,

36:21.780 --> 36:23.413
the lovely Miss Tasha Skanks.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.451
That's an oldschool classic.

36:28.453 --> 36:31.454
- Yeah!
- Yes, sir!

36:31.456 --> 36:33.857
Now, as most of you know,

36:33.859 --> 36:35.926
Triumph has moved
very aggressively

36:35.928 --> 36:40.864
these last couple months
to a greater inclusivity.

36:40.866 --> 36:44.201
One of the things we've been
pressing forward on with a passion

36:44.203 --> 36:46.570
is our outreach to the homeless.

36:46.572 --> 36:48.338
Yeah!

36:49.775 --> 36:53.677
Which brings me
to another special guest.

36:53.679 --> 36:55.879
Deputy Mayor Skip Leonard.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.681
Brother Leonard, please stand.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.755
Now, Deputy Mayor Skip Leonard

37:05.757 --> 37:07.891
and the fine city of Memphis

37:07.893 --> 37:10.260
have arranged
for Triumph to receive

37:10.262 --> 37:11.962
a very generous grant.

37:11.964 --> 37:13.396
All right, now.

37:13.398 --> 37:16.366
Worth $75,000.

37:20.272 --> 37:22.939
$75,000 to start.

37:22.941 --> 37:25.242
That's incredible work.

37:25.244 --> 37:27.010
Let's show him
how thankful we are.

37:35.887 --> 37:38.421
Now, there are some folks

37:38.423 --> 37:41.591
who said this couldn't be done.

37:41.593 --> 37:44.694
But obviously,
they haven't met my God!

38:09.021 --> 38:11.021
You ready to talk now?

38:13.759 --> 38:15.325
Are you?

38:23.468 --> 38:26.703
I know you had
an affair with Lionel.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.638
I saw it when he was here.

38:31.677 --> 38:34.911
- What matters is that...
- When?

38:34.913 --> 38:39.616
James, what matters
is that when he asked me

38:39.618 --> 38:41.918
to leave you...

38:41.920 --> 38:44.020
- I didn't.
- When was it?

38:50.028 --> 38:52.362
The summer we spent
at Nags Head.

38:54.066 --> 38:56.566
I used passion to fill

38:56.568 --> 38:59.836
the pit of pain you left in me

38:59.838 --> 39:02.405
with what you did
with my sister.

39:02.407 --> 39:04.941
That was a onetime thing.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.844
And I confessed
immediately after.

39:07.846 --> 39:10.113
You kept this from me for years.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.916
- I know.
- I had this man in my home.

39:12.918 --> 39:15.618
And you looked down on me the
whole time, the both of you.

39:15.620 --> 39:19.389
Like I was some kind of...
oblivious insect in a jar.

39:19.391 --> 39:20.690
I was terrified to tell you

39:20.692 --> 39:23.560
because I didn't want...
you to hate me.

39:23.562 --> 39:27.063
But I don't know
if I love you right now.

39:27.065 --> 39:29.032
Or if I ever will again.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.434
James.

39:36.675 --> 39:38.441
Do you think
you could really afford

39:38.443 --> 39:40.009
to give this all up?

39:41.847 --> 39:43.947
I don't know what this is.

39:43.949 --> 39:47.650
This. This struggle.

39:47.652 --> 39:51.454
This family, this fight.

39:51.456 --> 39:53.823
I didn't choose you
because you were perfect.

39:53.825 --> 39:56.393
No, all I ever wanted was this...

39:56.395 --> 39:58.795
Us, you.

39:58.797 --> 40:01.097
That the battle I would fight

40:01.099 --> 40:02.932
to be the best I could be

40:02.934 --> 40:05.902
would be fought with you.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.570
And if you question that love,

40:07.572 --> 40:09.572
then you question life itself,

40:09.574 --> 40:11.808
so please don't do it.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.810
James, please.

40:43.875 --> 40:46.042
Hey.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.577
You got a minute?

40:47.579 --> 40:49.512
Of course.

40:49.514 --> 40:51.948
Come on in.

40:54.519 --> 40:56.719
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.089
So, how you been?
You feeling any better?

41:00.091 --> 41:03.092
I am. Thank you for asking.

41:03.094 --> 41:05.228
I just wanted
to come by and tell you

41:05.230 --> 41:08.198
that I have cleaned out all of
my things out of the office,

41:08.200 --> 41:11.801
so it's free and clear,
and Kerissa can have it now.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.937
Well, you know
that wasn't necessary.

41:13.939 --> 41:15.538
Of course it was.

41:15.540 --> 41:17.006
Come on, we both know
that she needs it.

41:17.008 --> 41:18.475
That was thoughtful. Thank you.

41:18.477 --> 41:19.542
I'll let her know.

41:19.544 --> 41:21.511
And I just want you to know

41:21.513 --> 41:23.947
that I'm here to do
whatever I can do

41:23.949 --> 41:25.648
to make your job easier.

41:25.650 --> 41:26.850
That's why I stayed on.

41:28.253 --> 41:31.488
Well, that's, um... that's great.

41:31.490 --> 41:33.790
I believe in you, Jacob.

41:33.792 --> 41:36.493
- Really? Thank you.
- Yeah.

41:36.495 --> 41:38.995
- Of course.
- Thank you.

41:38.997 --> 41:41.498
You know, if we...

41:41.500 --> 41:43.766
If we both keep
believing in Jesus,

41:43.768 --> 41:45.101
we'll all make it
to Heaven together.

41:45.103 --> 41:47.136
Amen.

41:47.138 --> 41:50.106
Amen.

41:50.108 --> 41:53.543
Well, I should let you
get back to it.

41:53.545 --> 41:56.012
I know a pastor's day is full.

42:04.990 --> 42:07.690
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thanks for coming by.

42:07.692 --> 42:09.192
Of course.
