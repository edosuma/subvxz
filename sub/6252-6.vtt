00:02.420 --> 00:06.789
[ Knocking ]
Yeah.
[ Groans ]

00:07.925 --> 00:09.506
[ Knocking Continues]
[ Brennan ]
Booth?

00:09.594 --> 00:11.880
Yeah.
[Groaning]

00:11.971 --> 00:13.211
[ Bones Cracking ]

00:13.306 --> 00:15.592
[Groaning Continues]

00:18.227 --> 00:19.683
[ Knocking Continues]
[ Brennan ]
Booth?

00:19.770 --> 00:21.761
[ Bones Cracking ]

00:24.025 --> 00:25.606
[ Knocking Continues]
Are you there?

00:25.693 --> 00:28.560
No, I’m in South Beach
workin’ on my tan.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.278
[ Knocking ]
All right.
[ Groans ]

00:31.365 --> 00:34.653
You need Sweets to sign
your post-Afghanistan
“fitness for duty” report.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.446
Did you forget?
Me?

00:36.537 --> 00:38.528
Well, generally
you wear more clothing,

00:38.623 --> 00:40.534
and you’ve been
avoiding this for weeks.

00:40.625 --> 00:43.788
Well, I couldn’t sleep.
Hannah got up at
the crack of dawn.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.743
[ Bones Cracking ]
Oh!

00:45.838 --> 00:48.796
Do you always have
this pronounced a release
of gas in the morning?

00:48.883 --> 00:51.124
- Is it that bad?
- Synovial gas.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.881
- That’s what the cracking is.
- Synovial gas— what’s that mean?

00:53.971 --> 00:57.213
There comes a point
when your body can’t hide
all the abuse it’s taken.

00:57.308 --> 00:59.264
What do you mean,
“certain point”?

00:59.352 --> 01:01.764
You’ve been shot and beaten
and jumped out of airplanes.

01:01.896 --> 01:05.184
The skeletal damage alone—
Oh, God.
I’m fallin’ apart.

01:05.274 --> 01:08.641
You’re fine.
It’s your skeleton
that’s falling apart.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.068
The compression fracture
to your T3 alone...

01:11.155 --> 01:12.895
should have
incapacitated you
years ago.

01:12.990 --> 01:16.403
Then there’s the fracture
to your sternum from when
that obese girl shot you.

01:16.494 --> 01:19.031
Fractures to your metatarsals
from when you were tortured.

01:19.121 --> 01:22.488
Rib pitting from when
you foolishly tried to act
as a human shield.

01:22.625 --> 01:25.037
Rib pitting?
And that’s before we even get
to your compromised ligaments.

01:25.127 --> 01:27.869
Both intertransverse
and anterior longitudinal.

01:27.964 --> 01:30.125
How do you have room
in your brain
to remember all that?

01:30.216 --> 01:34.459
I care about you, Booth.
The more abuse a body takes,
the sooner it degenerates.

01:34.595 --> 01:38.258
That’s it?
That’s all you got for me?
It could be a good thing.

01:38.349 --> 01:41.261
In tribes,
men like you are elders.

01:41.352 --> 01:43.263
They don’t have
to hunt anymore.

01:43.354 --> 01:45.561
Well, I wanna go hunting.

01:45.648 --> 01:48.765
Well, perhaps
you’ll feel better after
you get your form signed.

01:49.652 --> 01:51.313
[ Daisy]
You know I will.

01:51.404 --> 01:53.190
- [ Gi '
_ Ohlggllng ] Oh, no!

01:53.281 --> 01:55.397
Agent Booth!
Dr. Brennan!

01:55.491 --> 01:59.200
You should be at work, Ms. Wick.
It is a very important day.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.027
Can you sign this?

02:01.122 --> 02:03.659
- Are you serious?
- Just sign it.
[ Chuckles ]

02:03.749 --> 02:06.582
Just sign and
get back to your fun.

02:08.004 --> 02:10.996
- Dr. Brennan, about this morning—
- What about it?

02:11.090 --> 02:14.423
I don’t want you to think that
Lance and l are dating again,
because we’re not.

02:14.510 --> 02:17.502
That was purely
accidental intercourse.

02:17.596 --> 02:19.257
You had intercourse
accidentally?

02:19.348 --> 02:21.304
What were you trying
to do, Ms. Wick?

02:21.434 --> 02:24.801
l was returning a book.
And your pants fell off?

02:24.895 --> 02:28.058
All of the pieces of ship
without remains attached—

02:28.149 --> 02:30.060
straight to the
Early American workroom.

02:30.151 --> 02:33.063
- Door on your right.
- [ Man ]
Where do you want this?

02:33.154 --> 02:34.360
Take it up on the platform.

02:34.447 --> 02:35.436
Got it.
[ Saroyan ]
Okay.

02:35.573 --> 02:37.655
How much of this
is there?
I have no idea.

02:37.742 --> 02:40.074
So when you said
“old remains,”

02:40.161 --> 02:41.776
the ship part of it
just slipped your mind?

02:41.871 --> 02:44.487
- No, of course not.
- [Angela ]
This is incredible.

02:44.582 --> 02:46.948
I can’t believe this
is an actual slave ship.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.541
Where did they
find it?
Off the coast of Maryland.

02:49.628 --> 02:52.711
This could shed enormous light
on the slave trade.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.254
Or give me nightmares.
One or the other.

02:54.342 --> 02:58.711
M yl/‘lus edu/is.
Blue mussels. Wow.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.419
They said
this was for you.

03:00.514 --> 03:04.803
The Jeffersonian board
of directors wants us
to try and identify the remains.

03:04.894 --> 03:08.182
How? These people have
been dead for nearly 150 years.

03:08.272 --> 03:09.728
[Angela ]
Yeah, well,
this might help.

03:09.815 --> 03:12.648
It’s a copy of
the outgoing manifest.

03:12.735 --> 03:16.023
And it lists all the slaves
they were transporting to New Orleans.

03:16.113 --> 03:19.731
There’s age and race
and degree of color.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.441
This is
really detailed...

03:22.536 --> 03:24.948
in a totally horrible,
disgusting, sucky kind of way.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.950
Slaves were considered
property.

03:27.041 --> 03:31.080
They were as carefully cataloged
as livestock or silvenNare.

03:38.052 --> 03:40.634
[ Brennan]
Male child, under 10 years old.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.098
130 centimeters.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.219
The marine mussels
compromised the bone,

03:46.310 --> 03:49.768
but the skull shows
a mix of Negroid
and Caucasoid characteristics,

03:49.855 --> 03:52.312
suggesting that
he would be listed
as mulatto.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.982
Got it.
Polidore Nelson.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.481
Symphyseal rim well defined.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.187
Partial ectocranial
suture closure.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.659
Female, 40s,
five feet tall.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.825
Okay, there’s only
one woman that small.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.449
Over here, now.

04:07.540 --> 04:10.577
Uh, not kidding,
even a little bit.
Dr. Hodgins.

04:10.668 --> 04:13.159
- Yeah. What do you got?
- That.

04:13.295 --> 04:16.253
What the hell is it?
[ Hodgins ]
Wow!

04:16.340 --> 04:20.504
It’s some kind of organism
anchored to the bone.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.336
Interesting.

04:24.432 --> 04:28.095
Alien sea life hitchhikes in
on a slave ship, and that’s
all you can say? “Interesting”?

04:28.185 --> 04:30.471
I think in this context,
“interesting” is a way...

04:30.563 --> 04:33.270
of acknowledging life forms
beyond Dr. Hodgins’s expertise.

04:33.357 --> 04:36.645
Temporary condition, I assure you.
Listen up!

04:36.735 --> 04:40.193
Pull any other bones
with pink slime
and bring ’em over here.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.362
It’s possible that “alien”
is an appropriate adjective.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.910
I mean, we may be looking
at N.T.|. here.

04:47.997 --> 04:50.113
- [ Saroyan ]
What’s he talking about?
- I have no idea.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.744
N.T.|., as in
non-terrestrial intelligence.

04:52.835 --> 04:57.420
- Oh, no.
- If alien life forms were going
to exist somewhere on Earth,

04:57.506 --> 04:59.246
the ocean floor would be it.

04:59.341 --> 05:02.299
- Please tell me you’re kidding.
- Judging by weight and texture,

05:02.386 --> 05:07.756
all of the affected bones
appear to belong
to the same skeleton.

05:17.610 --> 05:19.225
Something is very wrong.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.231
Come on.
I really gotta
look at these images?

05:21.322 --> 05:25.110
Yes. Penetrating trauma
to the cribriform plate
and palatine bones.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.198
You mean that
jaggedy-looking hole there?
Yes.

05:27.286 --> 05:29.572
The puncture would’ve
extended upward...

05:29.663 --> 05:32.780
into the anterior base
of the brain,
resulting in immediate death.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.536
This man was hooked
through the mouth—

05:34.668 --> 05:36.659
[Groans]
like a fish.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.494
Okay, got it.
Thank you very much.

05:38.589 --> 05:40.750
| just don’t know
how I can help you
with a murdered slave.

05:40.841 --> 05:44.834
They may have found him in
a slave ship. But given
the condition of his cartilage,

05:44.929 --> 05:49.093
this man died
less than a month ago,
and... this is murder.

06:29.473 --> 06:30.883
Abrasions to the pisiform.

06:30.975 --> 06:33.182
It’s likely this person
was wearing manacles.

06:33.269 --> 06:35.260
Why are you working on remains
from the slave ship...

06:35.354 --> 06:37.766
when you know our recent
murder victim has priority?

06:37.856 --> 06:40.233
Because Dr. Hodgins
is still trying to remove...

06:40.317 --> 06:42.899
the unidentified
deep—sea life forms.

06:42.987 --> 06:46.104
Maybe we should discuss
the murder victim’s
X-rays instead.

06:47.950 --> 06:52.535
Incomplete epiphyseal fusion.
He was at most 20 years old.

06:52.621 --> 06:55.408
Chipping on
the zygomatic arch.

06:55.499 --> 06:58.582
Hairline fractures
to the mental foramen,
all heavily remodeled.

06:58.669 --> 07:01.627
Metaphyseal fractures
to the left tibia
and right ulna.

07:01.714 --> 07:04.376
- Never properly set.
- I’ve seen these before.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.957
They happen when someone
has their extremities...

07:07.052 --> 07:09.759
wrenched over and over again
at a very young age.

07:09.847 --> 07:12.133
Suggestive of child abuse?

07:12.224 --> 07:13.930
We have to identify him.

07:14.018 --> 07:16.725
What is taking
Dr. Hodgins so long?

07:19.148 --> 07:23.437
We are looking at what could be
a clue to the origin of life itself.

07:23.527 --> 07:24.642
Come on.

07:24.737 --> 07:27.149
The origin of life looks like
a pink Chia Pet?

07:27.239 --> 07:29.446
According to one theory,
billions of years ago,

07:29.533 --> 07:33.492
organic molecules hitchhiked
to Earth on comets
that plummeted into our oceans,

07:33.579 --> 07:36.537
forming the seeds of life
as we know it.

07:36.624 --> 07:39.411
- Okay, now you’ve lost me.
- Look at this.

07:39.501 --> 07:42.368
The organism operates
like hair follicles—

07:42.463 --> 07:45.375
anchors its root system
to the bone.

07:45.466 --> 07:47.172
It’s actually kind of
attractive up close.

07:47.259 --> 07:50.217
Yeah, for a mucous—excreting
undenNater insect.

07:50.304 --> 07:53.262
[ Chuckles ]
Well, let me scan the skull,

07:53.349 --> 07:55.260
and then I can build
a facial reconstruction from it.

07:55.351 --> 07:58.343
Do you realize these guys
could be harder to identify...

07:58.437 --> 08:00.553
than a decomposed
murder victim?

08:00.648 --> 08:03.685
How can you compare
a murder victim to ocean snot...

08:03.776 --> 08:06.313
that looks like something
that Barbie wore to the prom?

08:06.403 --> 08:09.486
- You compared ’em to a Chia Pet.
- That’s not the same thing.

08:09.573 --> 08:13.191
You’re right. Because
if these guys are new
and | get to identify them,

08:13.285 --> 08:16.527
then I get to name
an entire species...

08:16.622 --> 08:18.783
An/e/on/cus monf/hegr/s.

08:19.583 --> 08:20.493
Really?

08:20.626 --> 08:23.208
Really.
[ Chuckles ]

08:23.295 --> 08:25.126
So the dead guy got caught
in a fishing net,

08:25.214 --> 08:27.000
and the fishing net got caught
on a slave ship?

08:27.091 --> 08:28.877
Yeah. A net gets lost.
It floats around for years.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.216
They call it
a ghost net.
Wow.

08:31.303 --> 08:33.589
Ghost net caught a ghost.
That’s—

08:33.722 --> 08:35.508
Something like that.
It’s ironic.

08:35.599 --> 08:38.181
Okay, why are you still here?
I’m weak.

08:38.268 --> 08:39.883
I’m weak, Agent Booth.

08:39.978 --> 08:42.640
I broke up with Daisy,
but I can’t keep my hands off her.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.687
What’s new, all right?
You’re a guy. Life goes on.

08:44.775 --> 08:46.857
Yeah. That’s the problem.
We broke up.

08:46.944 --> 08:49.731
But itjust goes on.
It’s-It’s like she’s a magnet.

08:49.822 --> 08:51.813
Should I just let it happen?

08:51.907 --> 08:53.818
Here. Pick it up.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.285
“Yes, definitely.”
You think?

08:58.372 --> 09:00.283
I don’t know.
How am I supposed to know?

09:00.374 --> 09:03.081
Years of experience.
The perspective of age.

09:03.168 --> 09:04.954
[Sighs]
Age.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.503
How is it that
I went to sleep Han Solo
and I woke up Obi-Wan Kenobi?

09:08.632 --> 09:10.497
l have no idea what
you’re talking about.
[ Beeping ]

09:10.592 --> 09:12.548
Oh.

09:12.636 --> 09:15.298
Looks like Angela
finished the victim’s
facial reconstruction. Oh.

09:15.389 --> 09:18.301
There is our ghost.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.306
[ Booth ]
He wasn’t on the
Missing Persons database.

09:23.397 --> 09:26.480
But I got a hit from the F.B.l.’s
facial recognition software.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.898
“Mike Casper.”

09:27.985 --> 09:30.772
Yeah, his wife lives in—
what is it— Calvert County.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.317
He’s married?
He’s got a kid and a dog
and a cushy aerospace job.

09:34.408 --> 09:37.866
No, that’s not possible.
He’s 19, 20, 21 at most.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.951
All right, Bones. He’s 28.
No— There’s no way.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.120
Booth, you really need
to double-check these things.

09:42.207 --> 09:45.074
Look, the battle scars
are to the body,
not to the brain, okay?

09:45.210 --> 09:49.078
You’re being very touchy.
I’m not being touchy.
This is Casper’s driver’s license.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.796
It’s the same face Angela drew.
Right there.
Okay.

09:51.884 --> 09:54.170
It’s possible he had
cerebral palsy.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.126
That could retard
bone development.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.803
Or you’re just wrong.

09:58.891 --> 10:00.051
[ Brennan ]
I’m not wrong.
[ Knocking ]

10:00.184 --> 10:02.266
You’re wrong.
I’m not wrong—

10:02.352 --> 10:03.762
Yes?
Mrs. Casper?

10:03.854 --> 10:05.845
- Yes?
- Special Agent Booth.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.146
- This here is my partner,
Dr. Brennan.
- How can I help you?

10:08.233 --> 10:10.940
- You mind if we come in?
- I’m actually in the middle
of something right now.

10:11.069 --> 10:15.108
- It’s about your husband.
- We believe we found his remains
off the coast of Maryland.

10:15.199 --> 10:18.191
Any reason to believe that
he might’ve been
on a boat recently?

10:19.870 --> 10:21.406
Ask him yourself. Mike?

10:25.042 --> 10:27.033
Hey.

10:33.967 --> 10:37.050
[ Booth ]
Victim got a driver’s license
with your name and his picture.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.549
He used it to charge up
a fortune in credit card debt.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.632
Yeah, I get it. The guy that got killed
is the same guy who stole my ID.

10:42.726 --> 10:45.342
But it’s got nothin’ to do with me.
I’m not exactly a violent guy.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.644
Mike’s very easy-going.

10:47.773 --> 10:51.311
This is a conversation
between you and your
credit card company, Mr. Casper.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.313
You know how they say
they record calls
for quality control?

10:54.446 --> 10:56.778
Well, turns out it’s true.
[Woman]
I’m sorry sir.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.947
Bul because you failed to
not/Ij/ us With/77 the lime—

10:59.034 --> 11:01.116
[ Casper]
How could / tell you
when / d/o’n ’2‘ know?

11:01.203 --> 11:03.785
[ Woman]
You shou/d’I/e contacted
the credit reporting agencies.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.863
/n the future,
if you place a fraud alert
on your card—

11:05.958 --> 11:07.949
[ Casper]
You wanna know what
I’m gonna do in the future?

11:08.043 --> 11:10.659
I’m gonna ﬁnd the scum
who stole m y /. D.
and I’m gonna kill him.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.336
What’d you
expect me to say?
They froze my cards.

11:13.423 --> 11:16.165
Our credit was ruined.
That piece of dirt,

11:16.260 --> 11:18.000
he cost us the house
we were tryin’ to buy.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.513
If we need a lawyer—
We don’t need a lawyer.
We haven’t done anything.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.304
My husband
is telling the truth.
He is not a violent man.

11:23.392 --> 11:25.098
Sweets, tell them
what you told me.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.800
According to the latest
clinical data,

11:26.895 --> 11:29.056
identity theft can cause serious...

11:29.147 --> 11:31.729
maladaptive psychological
and somatic symptoms.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.273
No kidding.
I haven’t slept in two months.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.726
Those symptoms
aren’t limited to insomnia.

11:35.821 --> 11:37.903
The hell is that
supposed to mean?

11:37.990 --> 11:41.357
Okay. That would be
one of the maladaptive
psychological symptoms.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.782
Uncontrolled rage.

11:45.831 --> 11:50.120
How could I kill him
when I didn’t even know
who he was?

11:50.210 --> 11:53.247
I noticed you have
a boat hitch on the back
of your car. You own a boat?

11:53.380 --> 11:56.292
Yeah. I fish. So what?
You have any big hooks
on that boat?

11:57.509 --> 11:59.966
Why?
A body was found
about a mile off the coast.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.635
I’m thinkin’ maybe you’re doin’
more than just fishing on that boat.

12:02.723 --> 12:06.307
All right.
I want that lawyer now.

12:15.694 --> 12:19.437
Dr. Brennan really needs these!
I don’t understand why
you can’tjust pluck.

12:19.531 --> 12:23.240
If I pluck them off one by one,
it’s going to take
a week, Ms. Wick.

12:23.327 --> 12:28.071
So what you need to do
is stop telling me
how to do my job.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.247
I don’t see how this
is gonna hurry things up.

12:30.334 --> 12:32.871
[ Sighs ]
If I figure out what they are,

12:32.961 --> 12:34.952
I’ll figure out how
to get them off.

12:35.047 --> 12:36.457
Any more questions?

12:37.174 --> 12:38.459
Not at this moment.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.757
[ Hodgins]
Aha! Yes!

12:40.844 --> 12:43.051
It’s a type of benthic worm.
See?

12:43.180 --> 12:45.091
Progress.
[ Saroyan ]
Okay.

12:45.182 --> 12:49.346
The only way I can get
DNA. to ID. our |.D. thief
is by using bone marrow.

12:49.478 --> 12:51.594
But your alien organism
has sucked it dry.
Okay.

12:51.688 --> 12:55.977
Contrary to popular rumor,
it is not my alien organism.

12:56.068 --> 12:57.274
Not yet anyway.

12:57.361 --> 13:00.728
But I have narrowed it down
to a type of benthic worm.

13:00.822 --> 13:04.314
How can you not be able
to ID. a fluffy pink worm?

13:04.409 --> 13:05.990
How many of those
could there possibly be?

13:06.078 --> 13:08.239
[ Chuckles ]
You’d be surprised.

13:08.372 --> 13:12.285
How am I supposed to figure out
who killed him when I can’t
even figure out who he is?

13:12.376 --> 13:14.992
All I can tell
from the X-rays is that...

13:15.087 --> 13:18.124
he had multiple fractures
that were never properly set.

13:18.215 --> 13:23.585
He also sustained
repeated facial trauma
between the ages of two and 14.

13:23.679 --> 13:25.215
So child abuse?

13:27.182 --> 13:29.218
He wasn’t on a
Missing Persons database.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.721
So it means
no one was missing.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.724
You have
a very strange tendency
to state the obvious.

13:34.815 --> 13:37.397
If you were a kid who got
the crap beat out of him...

13:37.484 --> 13:39.395
over and over again,
what would you do?

13:39.486 --> 13:43.820
You’d think about running away,
or you do run away.

13:43.907 --> 13:47.365
But he wasn’t
a kid anymore, Booth.
He was 19 or 20 when he died.

13:47.452 --> 13:48.862
Doesn’t mean he didn’t
run away before.

13:48.954 --> 13:52.242
And when a kid runs away,
someone reports him missing.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.244
A school, a neighbor—
someone.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.200
We were looking
at the wrong database.

14:00.424 --> 14:02.961
We need to reverse
the craniofacial
growth patterns...

14:03.051 --> 14:06.088
and run the results
against the
Missing Children’s database.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.794
Send him back to childhood, huh?

14:07.889 --> 14:09.971
Retain
the cranial proportion,

14:10.058 --> 14:12.891
but reduce the jaw,
narrow the neck
and raise the ears.

14:12.978 --> 14:16.311
Change the proportion of the head
to one part facial mass...

14:16.398 --> 14:18.184
to two and a quarter parts
cranial mass.

14:18.275 --> 14:21.312
Decrease the size of
the upper and Iowerjaw.

14:22.154 --> 14:23.610
Done.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.938
It’s hard to believe that
10 years from this,

14:26.033 --> 14:28.445
he’s gonna be
stealing |.D.s and
getting himself killed.

14:30.912 --> 14:33.369
[Angela ]
Okay. That’s him.

14:33.457 --> 14:34.913

Okay. That sounds a little
like puppy adoption
if you ask me.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.777
When I was in
the foster system,
we used to think...

15:02.861 --> 15:05.978
that kids that got on “Thursday’s Child”
won the lottery, you know.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.610
One day, they’re on TV.
Next day, big car pulls up...

15:08.700 --> 15:11.032
to take them to the suburbs—
every single time.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.030
Yeah, well, Liam
didn’t get adopted.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.908
Would’ve saved the juvie system
a whole hell of
a lot of time if he had.

15:15.999 --> 15:18.832
Court unsealed his records
because of the murder.

15:18.919 --> 15:23.913
He was busted two years ago
for B & E with another foster kid
by the name of Hunter Lang.

15:24.007 --> 15:26.373
- We’re tryin’ to track him down now.
- Oh. Why?

15:26.468 --> 15:29.926
Well, Liam testified
against Hunter in exchange
for a suspended sentence.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.753
Ooh. That’s not good.

15:31.848 --> 15:34.305
Rule number one:
Foster kids stick together.

15:34.392 --> 15:38.852
Huh. Was that
the kind of thing
a guy would kill for?

15:38.939 --> 15:41.772
Depends on the guy.
I know these kids.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.349
I’ll talk to ’em,
let you know.

15:46.530 --> 15:51.365
Has anybody else noticed
this is like a giant jigsaw
without the edge pieces?

15:51.451 --> 15:53.908
One person gets killed,
and it’s murder.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.327
Millions get killed,
and it’s history.

15:56.414 --> 15:59.121

think of them as bones.
It’s easier.

- I’m gonna need
to borrow these skulls.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.025
- Voila.
- Oh, no.

17:09.112 --> 17:14.778
Now, the bone-eating snot-flower
burrows into the bone,
like so.

17:16.077 --> 17:19.035
It cracks through the hard shell...

- Can you please get to the point?

17:38.183 --> 17:40.299

17:45.440 --> 17:47.021
You have to back me up
with Dr. Brennan.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.485
She hasn’t said anything,
but I know what she’s thinking.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.943
It’s an emergency.
Whoa. What am I
supposed to say?

17:52.030 --> 17:54.146
You have to explain
what happened this morning.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.732
Sex is a normal part
of the adult experience.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.033

what they were doing.
And he said...

18:08.463 --> 18:12.797
the nice deer in back
was pushing his friend
up the hill.

18:14.094 --> 18:16.176

18:16.263 --> 18:18.424

[Sighs ] You’re happy
we broke up, aren’t you?
Look.

18:32.696 --> 18:36.405
Dr. Brennan is not a prude.
I would suggest that she doesn’t
even care that we had sex.

18:36.491 --> 18:39.403
- Just that it was right in front of her.
- That would be logical.

18:39.494 --> 18:42.452
Not that it would ever
come up again anyway,
since it was an anomaly.

18:42.539 --> 18:43.995
Totally.

18:44.082 --> 18:46.539
But maybe there’s
nothing wrong with that
if it did come up.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.743
I mean, just as long
as it wasn’t here.

18:49.838 --> 18:51.123

18:51.256 --> 18:53.872
Totally reasonable.
Mm-hmm.

[ Booth ]
So the parole officer didn’t
have an address on Hunter Lang.

19:09.399 --> 19:13.062
But she said that he works on
a boat at the end of the dock
called the Dandeana.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.734
It’s possible that he was
drawn to the sea...

19:14.821 --> 19:17.358
because the isolation mimics
his childhood environment.

19:17.449 --> 19:20.031
- You’re overthinking this.
- There’s no such thing
as overthinking.

19:20.118 --> 19:23.781

or inadequately or falsely,
but the notion of—

Got it.
[ Sweets ] Okay.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.997
So since you guys

19:28.084 --> 19:30.917

19:38.762 --> 19:41.299

19:41.389 --> 19:43.721

19:43.808 --> 19:45.059
I hope not.

don’t care.

I’m definitely gettin’ the look here.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.630
- The look?
- The precursor
to sexual overtures.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.961
- [Woman ]
Let’s see what you got.
- Oh!

21:46.055 --> 21:48.512
[ Laughing]
Mama like.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.010
Hi.
[ Booth ]
All right, ladies.

21:50.101 --> 21:53.309
He’s got a curfew.
He’s gotta be back by 12:00 midnight.

21:53.438 --> 21:54.769
You’re gonna leave me?
Yeah.

21:54.856 --> 21:56.721
Okay. Hi.
Don’t be afraid.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.273
[ Brennan ]
The atmosphere
is very festive.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.643
Thank you.
Oh. Uh, thanks.
I’m fine.

22:01.738 --> 22:03.603
No— No need.
I’m workin’. Right.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.321
Anthropologically speaking—
Yeah.

22:05.408 --> 22:07.820
women were attracted
to older men because
they could take care of them.

22:07.911 --> 22:10.903
The world has changed.
These women can
take care of themselves.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.453
Well, it’s just wrong.
That’s all. Just wrong.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.826
Why? Because
it’s hard on men like you
who are past their prime?

22:14.918 --> 22:17.409
- I’m not past my prime.
- Prime is 18.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.540
Okay. Maybe just a little.

22:19.631 --> 22:21.997
Hey. Bones, there’s Hunter Lang.

22:22.091 --> 22:25.629
The posterior surface
of your forearm
is absolutely magnificent.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.005
Thanks.
I work out.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.052
You can work out somewhere else.
She’s not interested.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.472
- Don’t be so hasty.
- You kidding me?

22:31.559 --> 22:32.799
- He’s—
- Who’s the old dude?

22:32.894 --> 22:34.725
- I’m her partner.
- He’s my partner.

22:34.812 --> 22:37.224
She’s too old for you
and too young for you—
all at the same time.

22:37.315 --> 22:41.274
I think what he’s trying
to tell you is that I haven’t
yet reached my sexual prime.

22:41.361 --> 22:42.851
Ihave.

22:42.946 --> 22:45.107
- Definitely.
- Definitely.
- Really?

22:45.198 --> 22:47.655
Give me this right now.
Okay, come on.
Sweets, we’re working.

22:47.784 --> 22:49.365
Put the drink down.
I’m trying.

22:49.452 --> 22:51.943
Here, have this.
Yeah, lock your lips
around that, sweetheart.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.321
Come on. This way.
Want me to tuck you in?

22:54.415 --> 22:55.746
Aw.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.209
.i‘J [Dance]

23:00.296 --> 23:03.163
I know you had it rough, Hunter.
I was a foster kid too.

23:03.258 --> 23:05.044
[ Chuckles ]
Sure you were.

23:05.134 --> 23:07.261
How many foster homes
did you live in?

23:07.345 --> 23:09.381
Eleven, 12.
Who keeps track?

23:09.472 --> 23:12.805
I did.
Four places by the time
I was six.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.891
Not somethin’ you forget.

23:14.978 --> 23:17.094
Yeah?
What was your score?

23:17.230 --> 23:19.061
Score?
Supervision score.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.934
One means
doesn’t need supervision.

23:21.025 --> 23:23.311
Five means bring out
the meds and lock him down.

23:23.403 --> 23:26.190
Makes it easy on
the check cashers, huh?

23:26.281 --> 23:28.988
That’s what we called foster parents.
I was a two.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.492
l was a four.
Real pain in the ass.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.037
Great. So what was
the deal with you
and Liam Molony?

23:36.124 --> 23:39.787
No deal. No deal.
And I’m not saying that
because he’s dead.

23:39.877 --> 23:41.868
Right. He testified against you.

23:41.963 --> 23:43.669
I got over it.
Are we done yet?

23:43.798 --> 23:48.132
No.
The kids I was placed with,
we leaned on each other.

23:48.219 --> 23:51.962
If one of those kids betrayed me,
that would hurt a lot.

23:54.517 --> 23:58.135
Look, what Liam did—
I was like, whatever.

23:58.229 --> 24:01.972
You know? We talked about it
when I got out ofjuvie,
and it’s all good. No big.

24:03.318 --> 24:05.604
- So when was the last time
you saw him?
- Labor Day.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.560
Yeah, he was, uh—
he was workin’ the cougars.

24:07.655 --> 24:11.239
You see, most of the guys
that come here, they come for
the free booze, the easy sex.

24:11.326 --> 24:13.237
But not Liam.
He was smarter than that.

24:13.328 --> 24:15.239
He used to get the extras
from the old ladies,

24:15.330 --> 24:17.116
like money, gifts.

24:17.248 --> 24:20.740
Are you aware of an issue that
happened between Liam and a guy
by the name of Mike Casper?

24:20.835 --> 24:24.043
- No, I’m not.
- On Labor Day,
did you two leave together?

24:24.130 --> 24:26.837
No, no.
He must’ve bailed
when l was cleaning up.

24:26.924 --> 24:28.755
- Ask Nadia. She’d know.
- Why is that?

24:28.843 --> 24:31.459
He was one of her favorites.
Liam would always show up
with a carful of cubs.

24:31.554 --> 24:35.547
Nadia would get her boy bait,
and then Liam would have
all the cougars he could handle.

24:35.642 --> 24:38.099
- How many would that be?
- Come on, man.

24:38.186 --> 24:42.600
He’s 19. Was 19.

24:44.108 --> 24:45.769
Look, can I get
back to work here?

24:45.860 --> 24:48.772
I’m gonna go find Bones,
talk to Nadia. You get
the rest of his information.

24:48.905 --> 24:50.520
All right?
Yeah.

24:53.576 --> 24:55.032
Hello there.

24:56.663 --> 24:59.826
Me?
Aren’t you a scrumptious
little tidbit.

24:59.916 --> 25:03.579
No, no. In case you haven’t
noticed, I really don’t
fit this demographic, okay?

25:03.711 --> 25:07.750
You got it all wrong, sugar.
Why would I wanna be with them
when I could be with you?

25:09.425 --> 25:11.336
I just needed to know what they were.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.839
And now, I know what’ll eat ’em.

25:13.930 --> 25:16.216
Piranhas.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.809
And they won’t damage
the bones?
Nope.

25:21.896 --> 25:25.059
The bubbles
agitate the water and
encourages them to feed.

25:25.149 --> 25:28.107
- May | ask you a personal
question, Dr. Hodgins?
- No.

25:28.194 --> 25:31.857
I have got a beautiful wife,
a fulfilling job,

25:31.948 --> 25:34.906
and ljust figured out
how to remove snot-flowers.

25:34.992 --> 25:37.278
I’m gonna go ahead and savor
the moment here, Ms. Wick.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.660
Wow!

25:39.747 --> 25:42.534
Oh! Ah!

25:42.625 --> 25:44.957
[Laughs]
Perfection.

25:47.004 --> 25:51.088
That’s curious.
There are significant
abrasions to the bone.

25:51.175 --> 25:52.426
Can I see that ulna?

25:52.510 --> 25:54.592
One ulna coming right up.

25:54.679 --> 25:57.136
Ah! Whew!

25:57.223 --> 26:02.343
They look like kerf marks,
but they don’t go into the bone.
They go along the bone.

26:02.437 --> 26:05.770
And the staining says
they’re definitely perimortem.

26:05.857 --> 26:08.519
Well, I’ll swab ’em
and see what we got.

26:08.609 --> 26:10.349
The abrasions are everywhere,

26:10.445 --> 26:12.902
all along the anterior surface
of the bones.

26:12.989 --> 26:15.822
You know, I know it’s
one of the few areas
of my non-expertise,

26:15.908 --> 26:20.322
but does it look to you
like somebody attacked
our dead guy with a grater?

26:21.706 --> 26:25.198
,PJ [Dance]
I understand. Yes.

26:26.294 --> 26:28.080
Good-bye, Ms. Wick.
So what’d the lab say?

26:28.171 --> 26:32.710
The victim was attacked
by a sharp, pierced object
with multiple grooves.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.257
Some kind of
very large grater.

26:35.344 --> 26:37.209
Mmm. Before or after
gettin’ hooked like a fish?

26:37.305 --> 26:39.637
l have no way
of knowing that until
I examine the bones.

26:39.724 --> 26:42.261
We gotta find the
party planner around here.

26:42.351 --> 26:44.262
She throws
a very good party.

26:44.395 --> 26:46.977
I enjoyed my conversation.
Oh, with the zygote?

26:47.064 --> 26:50.306
Well, he’s charming.
He likes long walks
on the beach,

26:50.401 --> 26:52.562
and he enjoys
watching the sunset.

26:52.653 --> 26:54.359
That’s a line, Bones.
They’re lines.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.440
Well, I’m
prime real estate
anywhere.

26:58.534 --> 27:01.367
Never mind.
Hey, Captain,
have you seen Nadia Blake?

27:01.454 --> 27:03.194
She’s probably below deck.

27:03.289 --> 27:06.031
[ Exhales ]
That’s some, uh,
fragrant coffee you got there.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.367
[ Chuckles ]
I brewed it myself.
Uh, gotta keep sharp.

27:13.966 --> 27:17.254
Hey, Bones, our guy
was hooked through the mouth
like a fish, right?

27:17.386 --> 27:19.342
Uh-huh.
That fit the bill?

27:21.224 --> 27:24.933
The shape is consistent with
the damage to the palatine bone
and the cribriform plate.

27:25.019 --> 27:27.886
Right, whatever that means. But could be
our murder weapon, right? Yeah.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.356
Yeah.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.226
[ Brennan ]
We have to bring it
back to the lab...

27:31.317 --> 27:32.932
and test it
for trace evidence.

27:33.027 --> 27:36.235
Hey, Bones, could this
be our grater?

27:38.658 --> 27:42.025
Well, it is if
it corresponds to
the abrasions on the bones.

27:42.119 --> 27:45.452
Which means Liam Molony
didn’t get off
this boat alive.

27:46.749 --> 27:48.285
[ Glass Shatters]
[Woman ]
Don’t!

27:48.417 --> 27:49.497
I got it.
[Woman ]
Stop it!

27:49.627 --> 27:50.992
Freeze!
[Woman ]
I mean it!

27:51.087 --> 27:54.079
[ Gasps ]
Do you mind?

27:54.173 --> 27:57.631
Okay, come on. Cover up.
I need to ask you a few
questions about Liam Molony.

27:57.718 --> 28:00.630
- Do you mind if
I get dressed first?
- You got 60 seconds.

28:00.721 --> 28:01.927
[ Brennan]
Look.

28:03.432 --> 28:05.593
- What do you got, Bones?
- What happened to my 60 seconds?

28:05.685 --> 28:07.767
Maggots.
Most likely
blowfly maggots,

28:07.854 --> 28:11.893
indicating that
at some recent point,
there was rotting flesh here.

28:11.983 --> 28:14.269
Okay, you, pony boy,
let’s go. Out. Come on.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.147
You need a key
to open this look.

28:17.238 --> 28:19.320
- Bones, excuse me.
- What?

28:19.407 --> 28:22.114
- You people are crazy!
- Ah!

28:24.161 --> 28:25.571
You said Liam was
last seen on this boat?

28:25.663 --> 28:28.245
I’m thinkin’ that
he was killed
and stashed in here...

28:28.332 --> 28:30.163
until they got out
far enough
to dump the body.

28:30.251 --> 28:31.957
- What do you think?
- I think you’re right.

28:37.466 --> 28:42.005
Last time Liam was seen alive,
it was on one of your cruises
about a month ago.

28:42.096 --> 28:45.338
Hey, I don’t keep track
of the boys
who go on my cruises.

28:45.433 --> 28:47.264
My God, that’d be
a full-time job.

28:47.351 --> 28:50.138
As opposed
to arranging hookups.

28:50.229 --> 28:53.437
For a cub,
he certainly knows how to
take the romance out of things.

28:53.524 --> 28:55.731
We’re not talkin’ about him.
We’re talkin’ about you.

28:55.818 --> 28:58.605
So middle-aged women pay you
to hook up with younger guys?

28:58.696 --> 29:00.277
No, they don’t.

29:00.364 --> 29:02.320
They pay to go on
my cruises.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.444
What they do
when they get off
is up to them.

29:04.535 --> 29:07.277
One of your guests
ended up fish food
at the bottom of the sea.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.908
- I’m not seein’
the romance in that.
- And he usually does.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.409
Which means,
there really isn’t any.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.913
Hey, I liked Liam.
He was very good
for business.

29:15.004 --> 29:17.416
You took advantage of a kid
who didn’t have a mother.

29:17.506 --> 29:19.497
You basically fed him
older women.

29:19.634 --> 29:23.126
He needed mature companionship,
and my ladies
needed a fresh face.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.427
- And youthful physique?
- Exactly.

29:25.514 --> 29:30.349
There are plenty of guys
in their 30s and 40s
who have youthful physiques.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.472
- Yeah. Yeah.
It’s different.
- Yeah.

29:32.563 --> 29:35.305
- Not in a bad way, but—
- Yeah, in a bad way.

29:35.399 --> 29:36.980
You’re not helpin’ your case.

29:37.068 --> 29:39.775
If something happened
to Liam that night,
I have no idea what it is.

29:39.862 --> 29:41.318
The guy was stuffed
in a fish locker...

29:41.405 --> 29:44.147
in a cabin that
you seem to spend a lot
of your “quality” time in.

29:44.241 --> 29:47.324
Okay, how could I put him
in a locker I don’t
even have a key to?

29:47.411 --> 29:50.619
- Who has the key?
- Well, Captain Kelly.

29:50.706 --> 29:53.413
Maybe it’s him
you should be talking to.

29:58.965 --> 30:02.457
Do you have the results back
on the maggots
from the cougar cruise?

30:02.551 --> 30:04.166
Maggots are next
on my list.

30:04.261 --> 30:08.220
[ Sighs ]
Ms. Wick has already
confirmed the murder weapon.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.093
Everyone else is working
on the slave ship,

30:10.184 --> 30:13.301
which makes you
the clog in my drain,
Dr. Hodgins.

30:13.396 --> 30:15.808
I’m still trying
to figure out the trace
from those bone scrapes.

30:15.898 --> 30:18.560
It’s very strange
and sticky.

30:18.651 --> 30:22.735
Three primary proteins,
including a trypsin-like
serine protease.

30:24.073 --> 30:25.984
This is my
“What the hell are you
talking about?” look.

30:26.075 --> 30:28.361
It’s a waterproof marine epoxy.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.360
Glue.

30:31.455 --> 30:33.946
Why would the victim
have glue on his bones?

30:34.041 --> 30:36.418
Yeah. That’s exactly
what’s got me stumped.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.538
Ponder it while you put
the maggots in the blender.

30:38.629 --> 30:42.121
Hopefully, you can pull
enough DNA. to prove that
Liam Molony was in that locker.

30:42.216 --> 30:46.300
After he was dead, but before
he got tossed overboard.
I’m on it.

30:48.389 --> 30:51.552
Your boat hook killed him.
His name is Liam Molony.

30:51.642 --> 30:54.725
[ Scoffs ]
I’ve seen him before,
but I barely know the guy.

30:54.812 --> 30:56.177
Why would I kill him?
[Chiming]

30:56.272 --> 30:58.433
You tell me.
You got a wife?
She hook up with Molony?

30:58.524 --> 31:00.936
[Laughs]
Oh, please.
I’d have paid him.

31:01.027 --> 31:04.144
- Would you knock it off?
- They’re from
Ms. Wick and Hodgins.

31:04.238 --> 31:06.945
- It appears to be urgent.
- All right, just get on
with it. Be quick.

31:09.118 --> 31:10.983
[ Kelly]
She doesn’t really
listen to you, does she?

31:11.078 --> 31:12.784
It’s really
none of your business.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.737
[ Brennan ]
Dr. Hodgins
blended the maggots.

31:14.832 --> 31:17.198
They don’t have remnants
of human DNA.

31:17.293 --> 31:20.706
- They have
monocalcium paracaseinate.
- Which means? Explain.

31:20.838 --> 31:22.078
Cheese.
What?

31:22.173 --> 31:24.084
The maggots ate cheese,
not Molony.

31:24.175 --> 31:25.335
[ Laughing]

that’s not funny.

the horny-broad cruises.

31:32.266 --> 31:35.474
- I do gourmet parties
once a month.
- Your point is?

31:35.561 --> 31:37.847
Last week’s dinner,
there was a bunch of this, uh,

31:37.938 --> 31:40.315
you know, uh,
illegal Italian cheese.

31:40.441 --> 31:43.308
I took one of ’em.
Oh. I see.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.939
I don’t.
What does Italian cheese
have to do with maggots?

31:46.030 --> 31:50.399
There’s a traditional
Sardinian sheep-milk cheese
called casu marzu.

31:50.493 --> 31:52.779
It is riddled with
live insect larvae.

31:52.870 --> 31:54.906
I told you.
Look, I had nothing
to do with this.

31:54.997 --> 31:58.330
All right. Do you remember
seeing this guy on
the Labor Day cougar cruise?

31:58.417 --> 32:02.285
l might’ve seen him
out on deck with a woman.

32:02.379 --> 32:05.166
Nobody goes out on deck
on account of the bar’s inside.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.838
Can you describe her?

a little under the weather.

[ Sweets ]
Three separate studies suggest
this is a very effective method.

34:02.583 --> 34:04.323
It’s called
state-dependent learning.

34:04.460 --> 34:07.668
If we want him to remember
what happened when he was drunk,
just have to get him drunk.

34:07.755 --> 34:08.995
Right. Is this
really gonna work?

34:09.089 --> 34:12.081
Memories are anchored
in internal contexts.

34:12.176 --> 34:14.588
Yeah. For example,
if! had a drink,

34:14.720 --> 34:18.713
I would instantly remember Daisy
and how champagne just
makes her eyes sparkle.

34:18.807 --> 34:21.059

drunk enough already?

34:21.143 --> 34:23.429

34:23.520 --> 34:26.603
- I’d say yes.
- Okay. Let’s just
focus here, all right?

34:26.690 --> 34:28.851
- Labor Day cruise.
- Mm-hmm.

34:28.943 --> 34:31.025
Liam Molony’s on the deck
with a woman.
Can you describe her?

34:31.111 --> 34:32.647
Hmm.

34:32.738 --> 34:35.445
He’s confused. For example,
if I were to describe Daisy,

34:35.532 --> 34:37.818
l’d say
she was 5’5”,
beautiful brown hair—

34:37.910 --> 34:41.494
- Oh, for God’s sakes, Sweets.
- I remember.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.286
Her hair was red.

34:45.668 --> 34:47.784
And she kept, uh, flicking it.

34:47.878 --> 34:50.085
- Booth, that sounds just like—
- Claire Casper.

34:53.509 --> 34:54.919

We gotta go solve a murder.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.672

Wait, wait, wait!

35:03.060 --> 35:06.018
We got witnesses,
and they all put you on
the Labor Day cougar cruise.

Big whoop.
I go on a lot of party cruises.
They’re a fun night out.

Fun night out
with Liam Molony?

35:12.945 --> 35:15.027
All right.
You really want me
to say this?

35:16.657 --> 35:19.239
Liam and I hooked up
a few months ago.

35:19.326 --> 35:21.533
He used to come by the house
when Mike was at work.

35:21.620 --> 35:25.613
Ah. Okay, so when
Mike’s I.D. got stolen,
you realized that it was Liam.

35:25.708 --> 35:28.290
Could’ve been really easy
for him. All he had to do
was grab some mail.

35:28.377 --> 35:29.958
That must’ve
really pissed you off.

35:30.045 --> 35:32.536
You think I cared?
Boy went like
a hot little pipe.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.919
You definitely cared, ’cause
your whole little world was
about to come crumbling down.

35:37.511 --> 35:40.753
You went on that cruise
lookin’ for him, didn’t you?
What did he say?

35:40.848 --> 35:42.713
Threaten to tell your husband
about the affair?

35:44.893 --> 35:47.145
I didn’t kill Liam,

35:47.229 --> 35:50.187
and there’s nothin’
you can do to prove different.

36:10.210 --> 36:12.121
Hey. We’re, uh—
We’re almost wrapped up.

36:13.547 --> 36:16.755
Yeah. Booth called.
He thinks Claire Casper did it.

36:16.842 --> 36:19.379
But there’s no evidence
to tie her to the crime.

36:19.470 --> 36:22.177

I was talking about
the Amalia Rose.

moving them into the exhibit.

is tomorrow.

Not that this is
any of my business,
but, um,

| sort of thought that
you’d be more interested.

36:35.486 --> 36:38.774

Interested. Is that
what I’m supposed to be?

36:38.864 --> 36:41.947

- That because I’m black,
I should be all over this?

36:44.411 --> 36:47.494

My family were property...

36:47.581 --> 36:49.742
along with about
15 million other Africans.

36:49.833 --> 36:52.290
They were traded like cattle,
and they died like cattle.

36:52.378 --> 36:57.668
And I am trying really hard
not to let those bones
out there get to me.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.092
I’m sorry, Cam.
I should’ve been
more sensitive.

It’s all good.

Am I interrupting?

37:07.559 --> 37:09.174
No.
Uh, what’s going on?

37:09.269 --> 37:10.725
I ran a couple more tests,

37:10.813 --> 37:13.976
and the sticky stuff
on the bone abrasions
wasn’t marine epoxy.

37:14.066 --> 37:16.478
It’s barnacle secretion.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.650
I think I know
what happened.

37:18.737 --> 37:23.481
Now, imagine this platform
is the party boat,
and I am Liam Molony.

37:23.575 --> 37:26.282
And I’m Claire Casper—
sexually predatory
suburban housewife.

37:26.370 --> 37:30.158

So, Molony and Claire,
they struggle.

37:30.249 --> 37:32.160
[ Both Grunting ]

37:32.292 --> 37:35.705
Now, Molony, he’s strong.
We know that
from the bone attachments.

37:35.796 --> 37:37.787
But Claire, she’s got
rage on her side.

37:37.881 --> 37:39.963

overboard.

on board, scraping himself
on the barnacles.

37:49.601 --> 37:52.013
But Claire,
she grabs the boat hook.

37:52.104 --> 37:53.810
And stabs him with it
straight through the mouth.

37:53.897 --> 37:57.264
- Uh-huh.
- The hook tore through his
palate into the frontal lobe,

37:57.359 --> 38:00.192

as it was removed.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.364

What’s wrong?

38:06.452 --> 38:08.989
If the abrasions to
Liam Molony’s skeleton...

38:09.079 --> 38:11.115
were caused by
the barnacles on the boat,

38:11.206 --> 38:12.867
there may be evidence
in the barnacles.

38:12.958 --> 38:18.043
And that is why I sent the techs
out to the marina to check the boat.

at a prescribed rate.

breaking off the barnacles and
lacerating himself down to the bone.

grew in their place.

we found under those barnacles.

when they struggled.
