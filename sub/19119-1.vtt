WEBVTT

00:05.039 --> 00:08.209
(crowd shouting)

00:12.280 --> 00:15.249
(gunshots)

00:16.517 --> 00:19.420
(shouting/machine gunfire)

00:21.389 --> 00:24.325
(yelling)

00:30.464 --> 00:33.401
(screams)

00:54.855 --> 00:55.623
Wade.

00:57.625 --> 01:01.295
Wade, Wade,
we gotta get outta here!

01:04.198 --> 01:05.299
G'WINVEER:
Sheriff?

01:14.875 --> 01:17.811
(heavy breathing)

01:27.221 --> 01:29.190
He's awake!

01:29.223 --> 01:32.160
(Wade groans)

01:34.628 --> 01:35.796
Wade...

01:35.829 --> 01:38.599
(heavy breathing)

01:38.632 --> 01:40.368
What happened?

01:40.401 --> 01:43.837
(country blues music)

01:43.871 --> 01:44.838
* The dawn is up

01:44.872 --> 01:47.908
* There's fire
on the mountain *

01:47.941 --> 01:52.146
* They'll have to answer
for their crooked claim *

01:52.180 --> 01:55.583
* The hollows
they'll surround them *

01:55.616 --> 01:58.152
* And they'll go running back

01:58.186 --> 02:01.455
* To the wretched realm
they came *

02:03.657 --> 02:09.797
* Nor will the dogs of hell
refrain *

02:09.830 --> 02:15.436
* And the land will suffer
those who came *

02:26.914 --> 02:29.850
(crowd shouting)

02:45.966 --> 02:47.935
FOSTER:
You hear that?

02:47.968 --> 02:49.537
Of course I do.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.405
FOSTER: It's what you wanted.
You're the Bren'in now.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.974
It's not what I wanted.
It's not what I wanted at all.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.210
FOSTER: You wanted this stick
with every bone in your body.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.211
You might as well
be made of it...

02:57.245 --> 02:58.912
You're wrong, Foster.

02:58.946 --> 03:01.515
You married my Fa for this stick

03:01.549 --> 03:03.251
and then tried to poison him.
When that didn't work,

03:03.284 --> 03:04.952
you had your losty Asa
try to kill him.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.954
What would you
have me do, huh?

03:06.987 --> 03:08.889
If your Fa had been here
when those policemen came up,

03:08.922 --> 03:10.123
how many
would we be burying now?

03:10.157 --> 03:12.226
-Look, that has nothin' to do
with it. -Fifty, a hundred?

03:12.260 --> 03:14.762
You thought this job
was gonna be easy.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.564
Just sittin' up there
on the throne,

03:16.597 --> 03:18.566
handin' out sweets.
You listen to them.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.301
-Just leave me be.
-They are scared!

03:20.334 --> 03:22.570
It's cousin versus cousin.

03:22.603 --> 03:25.539
You think that the coal folks
down there...

03:25.573 --> 03:26.840
they're gonna be
the defeat of us?

03:26.874 --> 03:28.409
No.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.478
Listen to 'em.

03:30.511 --> 03:33.581
We're the enemy of ourselves,
always have been.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.284
Yeah? What would you do?

03:36.317 --> 03:38.686
If I hadn't married your Fa
and that was yours now,

03:38.719 --> 03:40.521
what would you do?

03:40.554 --> 03:41.922
I'd bring us back to how we was.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.527
Peace and love.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.396
It's our only weapon.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.898
(crowd shouting in background)

03:50.931 --> 03:52.633
Just 'cause it's heavier
than you'd like

03:52.666 --> 03:53.701
don't mean it ain't yours.

03:53.734 --> 03:54.935
Go on. Take it, G'Win.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.273
No.

03:59.307 --> 04:00.908
It ain't mine
'til the elders say so.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.749
(door bangs shut)

04:08.782 --> 04:11.819
MAN: We shoulda killed all them
police when we had the chance!

04:11.852 --> 04:13.587
You're a fool
if you think like that,

04:13.621 --> 04:15.556
because otherwise
we'd be dead right now

04:15.589 --> 04:16.757
or in their prison yard.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.759
If I may, there are
two days gone by

04:18.792 --> 04:20.661
and we ain't heard
nothing more from them!

04:20.694 --> 04:22.062
Maybe now they seen
our true measure,

04:22.095 --> 04:23.464
and they'll be
leavin' us alone.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.366
That's a pig's chance in a pan!

04:25.399 --> 04:27.000
WOMAN:
You keep quiet, you.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.469
It was your banjo king.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.670
That Big Foster.

04:29.703 --> 04:32.440
Yeah. He brung this on us
with his robbing and killing.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.574
If Foster were alive,

04:33.607 --> 04:35.042
he would know what to do
and he'd do it.

04:35.075 --> 04:37.044
No. We're lucky he's dead.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.847
And we're lucky to have us
a true leader now.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.816
No disrespect, cousin,
but we never had us

04:42.850 --> 04:45.653
a Bren'in so young, did we?

04:45.686 --> 04:48.522
We made the right choice
not to go harmin' those folks

04:48.556 --> 04:49.957
just to show them who we are.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.892
And that's why
they run off scared.

04:51.925 --> 04:55.329
Now, y'all need to remember
our Bren'in told us to do that.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.530
She got it right.

04:56.564 --> 04:57.931
(crowd arguing)

04:57.965 --> 05:00.100
She's not really our Bren'in,
is she?

05:00.133 --> 05:02.069
You apologize to her
right now.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.972
He will... as soon as
we see her with that Oak.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.907
Is that right?
Get out of my face!

05:06.940 --> 05:08.409
(crowd yelling)

05:09.543 --> 05:10.478
Hey, hey!

05:11.812 --> 05:12.846
-Come on!
-Quiet.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.783
Let her talk.

05:24.024 --> 05:27.695
Farrells, look around.

05:27.728 --> 05:31.365
Look at your cousin, your kin.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.601
We are a family.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.135
(in unison):
Yeah.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.505
We're united or we perish.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.740
That is our lesson.

05:39.773 --> 05:44.011
This mountain sustains us
because we love each other.

05:44.044 --> 05:47.581
If it turns on us, we starve.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.082
We get sick.
We die.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.953
Yes.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.655
We're safe.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.657
For now.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.726
But they are comin' for us.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.127
Dig up this mountain
for their coal rock,

06:00.160 --> 06:01.562
only we don't know when.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.534
So, from now on,
nobody goes down that hill.

06:06.567 --> 06:07.801
(in unison):
What?

06:07.835 --> 06:09.503
(crowd protesting)

06:09.537 --> 06:11.672
We cannot be startin'
any more trouble.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.642
We need to stay up here
where we belong.

06:14.675 --> 06:15.576
So, we can't
go down there no more?

06:15.609 --> 06:17.545
-It's only for a moment.
-(crowd shouting)

06:17.578 --> 06:20.047
Hey, hey, disobey the Bren'in,
cause more trouble...

06:20.080 --> 06:23.517
-(crowd yelling)
-...that's a fine idea.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.953
This is what got us into this
mess in the first place.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.461
We had to carry you
basically all the way down.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.095
Took about 12 hours.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.833
I fell off a cliff?

06:39.867 --> 06:41.802
More like a ridge.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.440
When the lightnin' hit,
did it throw me?

06:47.941 --> 06:48.876
Lightnin'?

06:50.511 --> 06:51.712
What lightnin'?

06:52.946 --> 06:55.182
You ran and fell
and hit your head

06:55.215 --> 06:56.984
and it knocked you out.

06:57.017 --> 06:57.951
I ran?

06:59.587 --> 07:02.155
Like a bat outta hell, Wade.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.725
Well, let's keep that
'tween the three of us

07:04.758 --> 07:08.796
and the 500 or so people
that were up there.

07:08.829 --> 07:09.763
Too late.

07:23.043 --> 07:26.046
*

07:26.079 --> 07:29.016
(birds chirping)

07:46.233 --> 07:48.168
*

08:05.686 --> 08:08.622
You heard them, Foster.
I ain't the Bren'in yet.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.591
Of course you are.

08:10.624 --> 08:11.892
After what I done to your Fa?

08:13.927 --> 08:15.563
You done what
you felt was right.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.166
What about his body?

08:20.801 --> 08:22.603
You need to find
his corpse, Foster.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.137
We won't rest until you do.

08:26.173 --> 08:29.577
I know his blood like my own.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.545
If the hawks haven't taken him
up to the clouds,

08:31.579 --> 08:33.280
I'll find him.

08:33.313 --> 08:34.582
Thank you.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.018
You're forgetting somethin'.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.322
What's that?

08:42.355 --> 08:45.292
I told you your secret
was safe with me,

08:45.325 --> 08:46.727
about you poisonin' him.

08:48.629 --> 08:53.266
But Asa, I don't figure
he's much obliged to keep quiet,

08:53.300 --> 08:56.169
especially now that
you put him in the box.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.805
You might want to
think about that.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.242
Just find your Fa.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.210
I'll handle Asa.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.248
So you say.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.854
*

09:37.144 --> 09:39.146
*

09:59.867 --> 10:02.936
(birds chirping)

10:28.729 --> 10:30.097
(birds chirping)

10:33.366 --> 10:35.368
(speaking softly)

10:36.269 --> 10:38.038
Asa, be free.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.422
Good morning, Krake.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.925
Bren'in, good mornin'.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.293
Krake, I need the key
to the prison box.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.863
Yes, ma'am.
It's right over here.

11:02.896 --> 11:03.931
I wanted to say...

11:03.964 --> 11:04.998
if you haven't
heard this already,

11:05.032 --> 11:08.468
and I'm certainly not alone
in this assessment,

11:08.501 --> 11:12.072
that I am grateful
beyond words

11:12.105 --> 11:14.742
that you are
our rightful Bren'in.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.777
Only because you, above all,

11:16.810 --> 11:20.480
know the power of peace
over war.

11:20.513 --> 11:24.284
We never picked a fight
with those flossties.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.019
You know, that's why
they been leavin' us alone

11:26.053 --> 11:26.954
all these many years.

11:29.389 --> 11:34.227
But may I ask,
are you forgiving him? Asa?

11:34.261 --> 11:37.965
Or are you thinkin' something
more dire will be his fate?

11:37.998 --> 11:40.433
He did kill our Bren'in,
like him or not.

11:40.467 --> 11:43.937
Yes. He did.
Uh, the key, Krake.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.205
It's gone.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.206
The key.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.177
Sundry sorries, ma'am.

12:15.135 --> 12:18.238
(sobs)

12:32.853 --> 12:34.321
(snorts)

12:56.409 --> 12:58.378
*

13:24.271 --> 13:25.906
*

13:44.657 --> 13:46.559
(grunts)

14:02.442 --> 14:03.911
(splashes)

14:14.454 --> 14:16.023
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

14:36.709 --> 14:39.112
(men chuckling)

14:41.514 --> 14:42.950
(phone ringing)

14:53.193 --> 14:54.194
HOUGHTON:
What's goin' on?

14:54.227 --> 14:56.463
He's making it into
his war room, looks like.

14:56.496 --> 14:57.697
What are you talkin' about?

14:57.730 --> 14:59.632
The governor appointed
an EM yesterday.

14:59.666 --> 15:00.633
What's an EM?

15:00.667 --> 15:02.669
Emergency manager.

15:02.702 --> 15:03.670
What for?

15:03.703 --> 15:06.974
To manage the emergency,
I guess. I don't know.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.341
Ask her.

15:13.246 --> 15:16.950
Sheriff. Howdy.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.952
Wade Houghton,
meet Matt Meyers.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.620
Hey.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.489
I did come
by the hospital, FYI,

15:22.522 --> 15:24.357
but you were out like a light.

15:24.391 --> 15:25.692
-Yeah.
-Good to see you up and about

15:25.725 --> 15:27.527
and safely here with us,
I might add.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.230
So, uh, what's all this about?

15:30.263 --> 15:31.598
Uh, Sheriff,
I got to apologize

15:31.631 --> 15:33.166
for commandeering
your meeting room like this.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.701
We are getting
an office trailer set up,

15:34.734 --> 15:37.037
so we'll be out of your hair
in no time, okay?

15:37.070 --> 15:39.572
Matt's our new
emergency manager, Wade.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.175
What do I need
an emergency manager for?

15:42.209 --> 15:45.045
It's a gubernatorial fiat.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.579
Gubernatorial fiat, huh?

15:46.613 --> 15:49.282
Well, I know all about
gubernatorial fiat.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.321
Well, I have a meeting
back at my office.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.023
I just wanted
you two guys to meet.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.058
Great. Thanks.
We'll talk to you later.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.194
Hey, keep that in here, okay?

16:01.228 --> 16:03.663
So, uh, welcome.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.465
-Welcome to Blackburg.
-Thank you.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.200
I'm not really sure
why you're in my station house.

16:07.234 --> 16:08.235
You know,
the finances in this county

16:08.268 --> 16:09.202
are in the goddamn shitter.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.338
I'm not sure you know
the extent of that.

16:11.371 --> 16:12.339
I mean,
we're talking bankruptcy.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.174
I'm supposed to lay off
two of your deputies...

16:14.207 --> 16:15.775
-Yah, that's not gonna happen.
-You're right.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.045
I moved garbage pickup
to once every three weeks

16:18.078 --> 16:19.012
and closed the free clinic.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.781
So, no one in your department
gets canned.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.583
You're welcome.
(chuckles)

16:23.616 --> 16:25.018
Demonstrating
fiscal responsibility,

16:25.052 --> 16:26.419
is what they call it.

16:26.453 --> 16:29.622
So now, we are clear to
get the funds we need.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.024
To do what?

16:31.058 --> 16:32.292
To keep the people
of this town safe.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.793
Yeah, that's my job.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.628
I know it is.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.565
And you don't come-- turn around
when I'm talkin' to you!

16:41.268 --> 16:42.335
You don't come in here,
start movin'

16:42.369 --> 16:44.771
all my furniture around,
tellin' me how to do my job.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.608
Uh, hey, guys, give us
a second, will you?

16:48.641 --> 16:50.777
-All right.
-Come on.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.719
(door closes)

16:59.752 --> 17:03.423
Sheriff, what part of
"I'm here to help save your ass"

17:03.456 --> 17:04.757
are you not getting?

17:04.791 --> 17:06.593
Uh, maybe the part about
closin' down the free clinic

17:06.626 --> 17:07.827
which is the only clinic
we got in the county...

17:07.860 --> 17:08.728
I make tough calls.
I make enemies.

17:08.761 --> 17:09.929
And throwin' rubbish
out in the street?

17:09.962 --> 17:10.997
-That's what I'm good at.
-Sat out there for three weeks.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.733
That's why they brought me in,
to save this town.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.335
You're here to save this town?

17:15.368 --> 17:17.370
You're here for one reason
alone, that's Shay Mountain.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.806
And if you think I'm going to
do anything about that situation

17:19.839 --> 17:22.342
without your counsel,
Sheriff, you're wrong.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.611
Okay. Here's my counsel
about Shay Mountain.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.779
We thought there was
maybe 50 people up there.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.849
We find out that there's ten
times that amount, maybe more.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.351
Women and children.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.719
So, if you want to
get them down,

17:32.752 --> 17:34.087
then you're gonna need bodies.

17:34.121 --> 17:35.855
I'm not talkin' about
two or three cops.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.491
I'm talkin' about
federal troops, ATF,

17:38.525 --> 17:41.428
National Guard,
helicopters flying in overhead,

17:41.461 --> 17:44.831
bringing in
1,000 or 1,500 troops.

17:44.864 --> 17:47.267
That's the only way
you're gettin' people down.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.670
I agree with you.

17:50.703 --> 17:53.606
We will need all that
to get the Farrells down.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.175
If not more.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.209
The only thing is,

17:56.243 --> 17:58.178
there are no plans
to kick them off right now,

17:58.211 --> 17:59.779
as of this morning.

17:59.812 --> 18:00.780
Come again?

18:00.813 --> 18:01.881
The eviction's on hold.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.151
Governor doesn't want
anybody going back up there.

18:04.184 --> 18:07.120
Not you, not me, not nobody.

18:07.154 --> 18:09.289
-Are you forgetting somethin'?
-What's that?

18:09.322 --> 18:12.725
There was a man killed,
murdered by a Farrell.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.194
His name was Breece Dobbs.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.629
Your brother-in-law.
I know that and I'm sorry,

18:16.663 --> 18:18.398
but our orders are
to stay down here.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.568
You're telling me
not to pursue a murderer?

18:21.601 --> 18:24.137
I'm gonna get the person
who killed him.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.372
I'm gonna get him,
whatever it takes.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.407
You hear me?

18:27.440 --> 18:31.678
I do, Wade,
but I gotta ask...

18:31.711 --> 18:33.680
how's that working
for you so far?

18:36.249 --> 18:37.517
How's that wrist?

18:37.550 --> 18:39.286
-(knock on door)
-Yeah?

18:39.319 --> 18:40.487
(door opens)

18:40.520 --> 18:42.255
Sir, it's the State House.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.191
Oh, great.
Great talkin' to you, Sheriff.

18:45.892 --> 18:46.926
Governor.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.261
How's it going, Bob?

18:49.529 --> 18:50.763
Yeah.

18:55.402 --> 18:58.338
(water running)

19:04.344 --> 19:07.247
(birds chirping)

19:42.882 --> 19:44.551
(sighing)

19:44.584 --> 19:46.853
Oh, give this to young Owen,
he'll love it.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.921
-Bren'in.
-Good morning.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.260
We wanted to let you know that

19:53.293 --> 19:55.328
everything's set
for your coronation.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.963
Two days from now.

19:56.996 --> 19:57.797
Seems awfully soon,

19:57.830 --> 19:59.732
considering
all the preparations.

19:59.766 --> 20:00.667
Folks eager.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.370
Been workin' steady
the past two nights.

20:03.403 --> 20:06.239
We shall be ready.

20:06.273 --> 20:09.809
But we need to bury our former
Bren'in first, don't you agree?

20:09.842 --> 20:12.712
Well, his body
hasn't been found, so...

20:12.745 --> 20:14.381
If you'll allow...

20:18.418 --> 20:21.454
Someone with good reason must
have wanted to rid this hill

20:21.488 --> 20:24.624
of Foster's rotting flesh.

20:24.657 --> 20:28.295
Who knows where
he or she may have took it.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.596
His body will be found
in due time

20:29.629 --> 20:31.764
and he'll be buried
with his kin.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.802
Emelye...

20:35.835 --> 20:39.306
there's a line
in the ceremony

20:39.339 --> 20:40.573
that I've been thinkin' on.

20:40.607 --> 20:41.908
Yes?

20:43.343 --> 20:45.645
Bronnlagh brenairah sli--

20:45.678 --> 20:48.315
Bronnlagh brenairah
sli ayn-clan,

20:48.348 --> 20:50.783
ayn sah-wyl myrlagh
un-Bren'in.

20:50.817 --> 20:54.287
Yes. If the Oak be taken...

20:54.321 --> 20:58.725
In a manner impure,
the Bren'in will not endure.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.026
That's the one.

21:00.059 --> 21:03.496
Purity does not often
appear in human form.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.299
A leader, it is said,

21:06.333 --> 21:10.337
must know all the corners
of their own soul.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.539
Otherwise, they cannot lead.

21:16.343 --> 21:18.678
I do not take
this passage lightly.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.747
Nor should you.

21:20.780 --> 21:24.851
But we need this rite and soon,
to reassure the clan.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.353
They're scared.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.856
We need you, Bren'in.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.858
Now more than ever.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.763
-(ATV motor revving)
-Go!

21:36.796 --> 21:38.798
(gunshots, glass breaking)

21:38.831 --> 21:39.966
Yeah...

21:41.067 --> 21:43.470
Got it.

21:43.503 --> 21:44.270
They say they're gettin' ready

21:44.303 --> 21:46.072
for the coming apocalypse,
is all.

21:46.105 --> 21:47.940
They're causin' it,
more like.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.477
(gunshots)

21:50.510 --> 21:52.445
(ATV roars)

21:53.613 --> 21:55.515
(cheering)

21:58.451 --> 22:00.387
(laughter)

22:02.655 --> 22:04.056
How'd you like that?

22:04.090 --> 22:05.091
Where's Hasil?

22:05.124 --> 22:06.125
Don't know.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.460
Li'l Foster?

22:07.494 --> 22:08.595
Just don't know.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.397
MAN:
Come on, now.

22:18.605 --> 22:21.941
(dogs bark)

22:21.974 --> 22:23.543
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

22:23.576 --> 22:24.544
(dogs whining, panting)

22:24.577 --> 22:25.778
Hey.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.352
Drop it, Farrell.

22:34.487 --> 22:35.755
Do it, now.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.696
(birds chirping)

22:45.998 --> 22:48.701
I ain't got
no quarrel with you.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.369
I ain't got no quarrel
with you, either.

22:51.504 --> 22:53.606
I always respected you people.

22:53.640 --> 22:54.941
For how you live...

22:56.108 --> 22:57.644
Free.

23:01.648 --> 23:02.915
All right, then.

23:06.519 --> 23:07.854
My dogs like you.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.121
They got a good sense
of people, too.

23:09.155 --> 23:10.623
Sweet pups.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.060
What are you doin'
all the way down here anyhow?

23:14.093 --> 23:16.028
Ain't you afraid of the police?

23:16.062 --> 23:17.997
I heard what they did.
I heard they raided y'all.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.700
That's a crime in my book.
Y'all got a right to your land.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.969
I was lookin' for somebody.
I'm lookin' for my Fa.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.104
Here?

23:26.706 --> 23:28.775
(chuckles)
Is he lost?

23:28.808 --> 23:30.109
Dead.

23:30.142 --> 23:31.811
Supposed to be, anyway.

23:33.813 --> 23:36.683
Well, how'd he get here then?

23:36.716 --> 23:38.217
That's what
I'm tryin' to figure out.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.852
I tracked him
all the way down this far

23:39.886 --> 23:42.789
and now there's... nothin'.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.156
Well, if he was dead,

23:44.190 --> 23:46.726
someone would have
taken his body to the morgue.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.027
If he's still alive,

23:48.060 --> 23:49.562
they would have taken him
to the hospital.

23:49.596 --> 23:50.930
Same place.

23:52.599 --> 23:55.668
I'm headed that way,
if, uh, you want a ride.

23:55.702 --> 23:57.169
It's about 14 miles.

23:57.203 --> 23:58.571
You comin'?

24:07.580 --> 24:08.715
Hey.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.018
What are you doing here?

24:14.954 --> 24:17.023
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

24:18.257 --> 24:19.959
I'm not.

24:19.992 --> 24:22.094
I just wanted to say...

24:22.128 --> 24:23.863
Say what, Hasil?

24:23.896 --> 24:26.599
Say that you're sorry?

24:26.633 --> 24:27.967
'Cause I wandered
on that goddamn mountain

24:28.000 --> 24:30.970
by myself for nearly two days
and could of got killed?

24:31.003 --> 24:32.572
Or because
I could of got killed

24:32.605 --> 24:34.974
by one of
your crazy-ass cousins?

24:35.007 --> 24:36.208
I didn't mean for it to get...

24:36.242 --> 24:37.910
So what did you mean, Hasil?

24:37.944 --> 24:40.580
'Cause you sure as hell didn't
fight to keep me that time.

24:40.613 --> 24:41.981
You didn't stand up
when it mattered.

24:42.949 --> 24:43.850
I'm sorry.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.852
Sorry doesn't get me
my job back, Hasil.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.154
I lost that because
I was off with you.

24:48.187 --> 24:51.724
Sorry doesn't get me shit.

24:51.758 --> 24:53.893
Look, I don't know how I ever
thought that this could work.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.228
'Cause it can't.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.569
I don't ever
want to see you again.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.525
I can get the rest of my stuff,

25:26.559 --> 25:29.862
you know, I mean, what I can
manage of it on the weekend.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.698
-Hello, Abby.
-Hey.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.199
What are you gonna do
with that house?

25:33.232 --> 25:34.801
If you're not gonna
live there?

25:34.834 --> 25:36.202
Yeah. I don't know.

25:36.235 --> 25:39.005
I mean, we grew up there,
Kayla was born there.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.873
Not like you'll get
much for it, anyway.

25:40.907 --> 25:41.908
Hey, kids.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.242
Listen, go wash your hands.

25:44.777 --> 25:47.013
So, Wade...

25:47.046 --> 25:48.948
Yeah?

25:48.981 --> 25:52.184
You want to tell me what
really happened up there?

25:52.218 --> 25:54.086
Really? As opposed to what?

25:54.120 --> 25:56.088
As opposed to what
people are saying.

25:57.690 --> 25:58.991
What are people saying?

26:00.126 --> 26:01.994
That you ran.

26:02.028 --> 26:03.329
Is that right?

26:05.397 --> 26:07.133
I thought I saw lightning.

26:10.169 --> 26:12.805
I thought I was hit by it,
like Dad.

26:12.839 --> 26:14.206
And were you?

26:21.814 --> 26:24.183
So, you ran and you fell.

26:26.118 --> 26:28.154
Yeah. I don't remember.

26:28.187 --> 26:30.122
Hey, kids. Let's go.

26:30.156 --> 26:33.225
Doesn't change anything now.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.161
I'm still gonna get the person
that killed Breece.

26:37.229 --> 26:40.299
I don't blame them anymore
for Breece's death.

26:40.332 --> 26:41.701
I don't.

26:41.734 --> 26:44.904
I blame that company
and that woman.

26:44.937 --> 26:48.174
(scoffs) The minute
he started that job,

26:48.207 --> 26:49.608
everything went to hell.

26:52.244 --> 26:53.880
Turn off the television.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.153
I'm gonna get the man
who did it.

27:01.187 --> 27:03.122
I don't want you
goin' back up that mountain.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.892
I need you here... with us.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.894
You're all we've got.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.628
-You hear me?
-Yeah.

27:11.030 --> 27:11.898
You want to say grace?

27:13.833 --> 27:17.169
There's too much ugliness
in this world.

27:17.203 --> 27:18.871
Too much division.

27:18.905 --> 27:20.106
Everybody's mad at the people

27:20.139 --> 27:21.908
they should have
some solidarity with.

27:21.941 --> 27:25.044
Folks like us,
we got nothin'.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.846
We should be stickin' together,
you know?

27:29.148 --> 27:32.151
Hey, listen. My wife baked
some cookies for a friend.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.186
I'm supposed to drop them off
to the husband,

27:34.220 --> 27:36.155
but he ain't home.
He's at the bar.

27:36.188 --> 27:39.258
So, I'm gonna go in here
for just a minute, all right?

27:44.463 --> 27:45.832
Look, give me two minutes.

27:56.976 --> 27:59.912
(birds chirping)

28:03.950 --> 28:05.117
Cousin.

28:06.218 --> 28:07.319
Hello, Bren'in.

28:10.056 --> 28:14.160
I was, uh, just out
searchin' for some ginseng

28:14.193 --> 28:16.195
for your coronation batch.

28:19.966 --> 28:22.301
What I need isn't wine, Hasil.

28:24.470 --> 28:26.105
Sure? Well,
if there's anythin'...

28:26.138 --> 28:27.840
I know you love
that girl fiercely,

28:27.874 --> 28:30.142
but we need you right now.

28:30.176 --> 28:31.844
I need you.

28:32.979 --> 28:34.313
I do.

28:36.415 --> 28:37.349
Do you understand me?

28:40.252 --> 28:42.054
Clear as a bell, ma'am.

28:45.557 --> 28:49.829
I want you to know
that I made my choice.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.263
And I'm not goin' anywhere.

28:53.165 --> 28:55.167
Ever again.

28:55.201 --> 28:56.869
Thank you.

29:03.009 --> 29:04.443
Look what I got.

29:04.476 --> 29:05.845
Oh, well, you tell her
thanks for me,

29:05.878 --> 29:07.079
-all right?
-All right.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.781
I'll probably just eat them all
myself, I'll tell you what.

29:08.815 --> 29:09.782
(chuckles)

29:09.816 --> 29:11.417
You'd think I was
her goddamn delivery boy.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.319
You are a goddamn
delivery boy.

29:13.352 --> 29:14.854
Bitch!

29:14.887 --> 29:17.990
Man! Cut him off, Joe.
Seriously.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.458
-That's enough.
-Yeah, you're done.

29:19.491 --> 29:20.426
Hey, Jed.

29:20.459 --> 29:23.029
You know you got
a wild animal in your truck?

29:23.062 --> 29:24.831
Not talking about
those labs either.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.332
A Farrell!

29:26.365 --> 29:28.801
He's a good guy, all right?
I'm just givin' him a ride.

29:28.835 --> 29:30.002
Hey, what's that?
A Farrell?

29:30.036 --> 29:31.804
Yes. He's a good guy, Jake.

29:31.838 --> 29:33.172
What the hell are you thinking?

29:33.205 --> 29:34.874
-(all yelling)
-Come on!

29:35.908 --> 29:37.076
Just calm down.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.577
Get the hell out of my way.

29:38.610 --> 29:42.548
(all yelling)

29:42.581 --> 29:44.250
Son of a bitch!

29:45.384 --> 29:46.352
He didn't do nothin'!

29:46.385 --> 29:48.354
There's that son of a bitch.

29:48.387 --> 29:51.057
Yeah, Sheriff?
Yeah, I'm sorry to bother you,

29:51.090 --> 29:52.591
but I think we're gonna have
some trouble down at the bar.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.561
-(all yelling)
-There he is!

29:58.097 --> 29:59.231
Come on! Get out!

29:59.265 --> 30:02.068
What you doin'
down here, boy? Huh?

30:02.101 --> 30:03.602
Huh, what you doin' here?

30:03.635 --> 30:05.604
Hey, guys, guys, calm!

30:05.637 --> 30:07.306
-Calm the hell down.
-Come on, boy.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.508
-Hey, we're all friends here.
-I ain't your friend.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.509
I don't want to fight.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.144
Just leave him alone, okay?

30:12.178 --> 30:14.146
-You protectin' him?
-He ain't done nothin' to you.

30:14.180 --> 30:17.116
He's probably the one
killed Breece!

30:17.149 --> 30:19.085
What the hell are you doin'?
Calm the hell down!

30:19.118 --> 30:20.086
(groans, grunts and shouting)

30:20.119 --> 30:22.421
Get off him, you animals!

30:22.454 --> 30:24.991
Get him! Come on!

30:27.159 --> 30:28.194
Come on!

30:30.196 --> 30:31.931
Son of a bitch!

30:31.964 --> 30:33.599

30:35.167 --> 30:36.368

30:38.170 --> 30:39.972

30:42.474 --> 30:47.013

30:47.046 --> 30:49.081
-Come on! -Yeah, what are you
gonna do now?

30:49.115 --> 30:50.216
Get in there!

30:50.249 --> 30:51.217

30:51.250 --> 30:53.452

-Get him!

30:53.485 --> 30:54.921

-Dammit!

30:54.954 --> 30:56.923

30:56.956 --> 30:58.057

30:58.090 --> 30:59.658

30:59.691 --> 31:01.293

31:05.464 --> 31:06.532
Drop that!
Drop the knife right now!

31:06.565 --> 31:09.368
Drop the knife! I'm trained
on your head right now.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.537
Drop the knife.
Shut your mouth. Drop the knife.

31:11.570 --> 31:12.972
-Drop it right now.
-MAN: Shoot him!

31:13.005 --> 31:14.006
You drop that knife
right now!

31:14.040 --> 31:15.207
You understand me?

31:15.241 --> 31:16.475
Drop the knife!

31:16.508 --> 31:18.210
-Drop the knife right now.
-Drop it.

31:18.244 --> 31:20.279
On the ground, right now!

31:20.312 --> 31:21.280
-Shoot him!
-Shut up, Jake.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.215
Back the hell up, you moron.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.417
Down on your knees.
Hands behind your head.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.986
Right now.
You heard me.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.927

31:40.566 --> 31:41.500
G'WINVEER:

32:45.331 --> 32:46.265
FULTS:

32:47.566 --> 32:48.667
Ask a few questions.

32:52.371 --> 32:54.173
You want video?

32:54.206 --> 32:55.207
No.

33:02.714 --> 33:07.019
Like I was tellin' you,
them boys come after me.

33:07.053 --> 33:09.088
I was just
lookin' after myself.

33:09.121 --> 33:11.257
Yeah, I know that.
I don't care about them at all.

33:11.290 --> 33:12.291
I just want to ask you
a few questions.

33:12.324 --> 33:13.592
Then you can leave.

33:13.625 --> 33:14.726
All right, then.

33:15.794 --> 33:17.029
What's your name?

33:17.063 --> 33:20.366
-Full name?
-Foster Farrell the 8th.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.034
What's yours?

33:23.802 --> 33:25.371
Wade Houghton.

33:29.075 --> 33:31.577
So... you know Asa Farrell?

33:31.610 --> 33:33.412
That's the man
we're lookin' for.

33:33.445 --> 33:34.613
I do.

33:34.646 --> 33:36.082
You know where he is now?

33:36.115 --> 33:37.483
He's in a big iron box

33:37.516 --> 33:39.185
at the top of Shay Mountain.

33:44.823 --> 33:46.258
You know why we're up there?

33:48.260 --> 33:49.361
You know who that is?

33:53.732 --> 33:57.269
Not by name, but I've seen
that day that he was shot, yeah.

33:59.105 --> 34:01.173
Shot by who?

34:01.207 --> 34:03.109
Asa Farrell told me
he was shot by your Bren'in.

34:03.142 --> 34:04.076
Is that right?

34:06.178 --> 34:08.280
Foster Farrell the 6th.

34:08.314 --> 34:11.550
He was my Bren'in.
He was my father.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.619
He was your Bren'in?
What is he now?

34:13.652 --> 34:16.155
He's dead is what he is.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.557
Shot by Asa Farrell.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.659
Asa Farrell shot your father?

34:20.692 --> 34:21.793
Mm-hmm.

34:21.827 --> 34:22.794
That's why
he's in the big iron box?

34:22.828 --> 34:24.163
That's right.

34:26.332 --> 34:28.434
You tellin' me the truth?

34:28.467 --> 34:31.237
I never told a lie
in all my life.

34:31.270 --> 34:36.142
This man here, he was--
he was killed wrongly.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.777
So we blessed his body,
brought him back down here

34:38.810 --> 34:41.347
for y'all so you could put him
in your graveyard.

34:46.252 --> 34:48.887
Well, can I go now?
You said that I could.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.256
Yeah, I just got to
make a phone call

34:50.289 --> 34:51.623
and fill out
a couple of forms.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.826
You're lyin'.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.462
I see it all over you.

34:56.495 --> 34:57.629
You know that day up there,

34:57.663 --> 35:00.266
you ran like you was
afraid of somethin'?

35:00.299 --> 35:02.701
But it wasn't us.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.272
What were you afraid of, Wade?

35:10.376 --> 35:11.343
(door opens)

35:15.914 --> 35:17.849
He do it? He the killer?

35:17.883 --> 35:18.850
HOUGHTON:
No.

35:18.884 --> 35:21.687
How do you know?

35:21.720 --> 35:23.655
I just do.

35:23.689 --> 35:25.824
Are we gonna arrest him
for disorderly?

35:25.857 --> 35:27.726
Uh...

35:27.759 --> 35:29.461
no.

35:29.495 --> 35:31.630
So we should release him then?

35:32.798 --> 35:33.865
No, he's a witness.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.801
I want to hold him overnight
for more questioning.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.336
-We can't hold on to...
-We've got a bunch of guys

35:37.369 --> 35:38.837
standin' at the front
of this police station

35:38.870 --> 35:41.340
waitin' to kick his ass
the moment we let him go.

35:41.373 --> 35:42.674
So, we're keepin' him here.

35:46.878 --> 35:50.316

Bren'in?

38:42.788 --> 38:44.790
I'm sorry to disturb you.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.992
What I said before,
my hesitation?

38:47.025 --> 38:50.629
-Yes?
-Well, I'm ready now.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.063
To take the Oak.

38:53.632 --> 38:56.101
Day after tomorrow it is,
as we planned.

38:56.134 --> 38:58.904
Well, if you don't mind,
I'd rather not wait.

38:58.937 --> 39:01.039
-Tomorrow then?
-No, tonight.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.942
-Tonight?
-Now.

39:03.975 --> 39:06.878
I'll gather the others.

39:06.912 --> 39:07.946
Thank you.

39:15.821 --> 39:18.724
Excuse me.

39:18.757 --> 39:21.893
Norfolk Southern run
through here or just Tennken?

39:21.927 --> 39:23.529
You catchin' out?

39:23.562 --> 39:24.896
Well, what does it look like,
old man?

39:24.930 --> 39:26.565
(distant train whistle)

39:26.598 --> 39:29.701
R.J. Coreman's the only company
left in this yard.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.570
Any trains headin' west?

39:31.603 --> 39:32.704

39:35.474 --> 39:37.409
Mind if I join you?

39:37.443 --> 39:39.010
Sure thing.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.078
Thank you.

39:40.111 --> 39:41.112
Where you headin'?

39:41.146 --> 39:45.050
Ah, California, Thailand.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.518
Doesn't really matter
at this point

39:46.552 --> 39:49.588
so long as it's
far away from here.

39:49.621 --> 39:52.724
Say, you don't look
like a hobo.

39:52.758 --> 39:53.659
(laughs)

39:53.692 --> 39:55.927
But you don't seem like
one of us, either.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.131
Why'd you say that?

40:00.165 --> 40:03.602
You look a right bit local
to me, am I correct?

40:03.635 --> 40:06.638
Yes and no, no and yes.

40:06.672 --> 40:08.206
Can I ask you somethin'?

40:08.239 --> 40:10.141
Yeah, shoot.

40:10.175 --> 40:11.910

40:14.880 --> 40:16.582

40:16.615 --> 40:18.817
Nope. Not me.

40:18.850 --> 40:23.789
Yeah, you look a little...

40:23.822 --> 40:25.824
I don't know...

40:25.857 --> 40:26.992
wild.

40:29.695 --> 40:30.696
(chuckles)

40:30.729 --> 40:32.931
Do I look like
an animal to you?

40:32.964 --> 40:35.066
Do I smell like an animal?

40:35.100 --> 40:36.902
'Cause they're animals.

40:36.935 --> 40:37.703
They're beasts.

40:37.736 --> 40:40.772
They're lost,
and you know what,

40:40.806 --> 40:43.509
I hope they rot in whatever hell
they're walking towards,

40:43.542 --> 40:45.143
you understand me?

40:45.176 --> 40:46.878
Hey, brother, I didn't mean
nothin' by it.

40:46.912 --> 40:50.549
