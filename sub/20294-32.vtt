DRIVIN' DOWN THE STREET,
AND YOU'RE TURNING,

04:34.833 --> 04:36.700

05:02.733 --> 05:05.167
-ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS JUST SAY,
"YOU KNOW WHAT? I HAVE
SOME WEED" ON YOU,

05:05.267 --> 05:07.633

05:18.633 --> 05:21.200
JUST THAT LITTLE BIT OF WEED,
THAT'S NOT WORTH GOING TO JAIL
FOR, IS IT?

05:21.300 --> 05:22.833
-OR FIGHTING.
OR AT LEAST FIGHTING.

05:22.933 --> 05:24.867

ARE YOU GOOD?

05:37.433 --> 05:38.667
-YES, I'M OKAY.
-OKAY.

05:38.767 --> 05:42.067
-MY OFFICERS DIDN'T DO--

05:47.500 --> 05:49.233
THEY ASK ABOUT...

05:49.333 --> 05:50.700
-OKAY.
-SO-- SO WHY'D YOU, UH--

05:50.800 --> 05:52.600
YOU WANTED TO TALK JUST 'CAUSE
YOU HAD THE LITTLE BIT OF WEED?

05:52.700 --> 05:55.233
-NO. HEY, LISTEN.
THIS IS WHAT IT WAS.

05:55.333 --> 05:56.733
-I MEAN, WE CAN DO--

05:56.833 --> 05:59.100
WE CAN DO LESS THAN AN OUNCE.
WE CAN DO A CITY CHARGE ON THAT.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.500
-THIS IS WHAT IT WAS.
-OKAY.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.300
-HE CAME,
I DROPPED MY HELMET,

06:03.400 --> 06:05.100
SO I FIGURED
TURN AROUND AND GET IT

06:05.200 --> 06:06.467
RIGHT THERE.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.100
-HE CAME UP--
-HE SAW YOU WITHOUT THE HELMET?

06:08.200 --> 06:11.067
-YEAH. HE CAME UP WITH HIS
LIGHTS OFF, SO THAT'S WHAT
REALLY BLEW ME.

06:11.100 --> 06:14.133
-OKAY.
-HE HIT IT LIKE--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOING ON.

06:14.233 --> 06:15.667
-OKAY.

06:15.767 --> 06:18.167
-AND THEN...

06:18.267 --> 06:21.500

YOU WITHOUT THE HELMET, RIGHT?

06:21.600 --> 06:23.200
-YEAH, HE SAID-- YEAH.
-OKAY.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.500
AND THAT'S A VIOLATION
OF TRAFFIC LAW, WHICH IS WHY
THEY WERE STOPPING YOU.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.900
-AND YOU GOTTA HAVE
LICENSE TO RIDE ON THE MOPED?
-CORRECT. MM-HMM.

06:30.067 --> 06:32.433
YOU'VE BEEN COOL AND COLLECTED,
SO WE'RE GONNA DO A CITY CHARGE.

06:32.533 --> 06:35.133
-BUT Y'ALL AIN'T GONNA
GIVE ME THE EXTRA CHARGES THEN?
-NO.

06:35.233 --> 06:38.167
-THE RIDING WITH NO--
MOPED, NONE OF THAT.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.433
-Y'ALL NOT GONNA
DO ME LIKE THAT THEN?
-WE DON'T OPERATE LIKE THAT.

06:40.533 --> 06:41.967
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU DOWN
TO PRE-TRIAL.

06:42.067 --> 06:43.633
I'VE ALREADY GOT

-Y'ALL AIN'T GONNA
HIT ME WITH NO LIGHTS?
DRIVING WITH NO LIGHTS?

06:49.500 --> 06:51.067
-WE WILL DO JUST
THE LESS THAN THE OUNCE.

06:51.167 --> 06:53.567
-THANK YOU, SIR. THANK YOU.
-OKAY? ALL RIGHT.

07:00.067 --> 07:01.367

07:05.900 --> 07:07.900
WE NEVER WANT ANYBODY
TO BE SCARED OF US.

BE POSITIVELY I.D.'ed.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.700

-(chuckles)

12:41.267 --> 12:43.133
BY THE TIME--
I'M GONNA BE HERE STUMBLING

12:43.233 --> 12:46.233

12:54.467 --> 12:55.900
SO WHY'D YOU RUN?

12:56.067 --> 12:59.067
-IF YOU GUYS ARE TRYING
TO GET-- TRYING TO ASK
FOR A STATEMENT,

12:59.100 --> 13:00.333
I AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO SAY.

13:00.433 --> 13:02.800
I MEAN, I AIN'T TRYING TO BE
DISRESPECTFUL OR RUDE,

13:02.900 --> 13:05.900
BUT YOU ASKED ME FOR MY NAME,
YOU ASKED ME FOR A WHATEVER,

13:06.067 --> 13:07.867
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
I AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO SAY.

13:07.967 --> 13:09.233
-OKAY.
-YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

13:09.333 --> 13:11.633
-WELL, YOU'RE BEING CHARGED
WITH BRANDISHING A FIREARM,

13:11.733 --> 13:15.100
RESISTING WHEN YOU RAN,
AND FOR GIVING FALSE INFORMATION
TO A POLICE OFFICER.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.167
-OKAY. CAN I GO TO JAIL NOW?

13:17.267 --> 13:18.833
-YEAH.
-ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

13:21.433 --> 13:23.600
-I WAS BORN AND RAISED
IN ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO,

13:23.700 --> 13:26.700
AND I ENDED UP GOING TO SCHOOL
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.567
GRADUATED WITH A BACHELOR'S

13:28.667 --> 13:30.433
IN ECONOMICS
AND POLITICAL SCIENCE.

13:30.533 --> 13:32.733
I HAD A FEW FRIENDS
THAT WERE COPS AND THEY SAID,

13:32.833 --> 13:34.633
"YOU SHOULD, YOU KNOW,
TRY IT OUT, SEE HOW IT IS,"

13:34.733 --> 13:36.900
AND HERE I AM, YOU KNOW,
DOING THIS NOW

13:37.067 --> 13:38.600
FOR ALMOST SEVEN
AND A HALF YEARS.

13:38.700 --> 13:41.400
IT LOOKS LIKE SOME OFFICERS WERE
DISPATCHED TO A DUI

13:41.500 --> 13:43.800
AND ANOTHER MALE SHOWED UP
ON THE STOP,

13:43.900 --> 13:45.667
SO WE'RE GONNA SEE
IF WE CAN HELP THEM OUT.

13:46.667 --> 13:47.900
YEAH, THIS IS THE GUY.

13:50.533 --> 13:53.833
-THIS GUY WAS HANGING OUT
BY THE GREEN CAR

13:53.933 --> 13:56.500
AND HE WALKS OVER HERE
AND SITS OVER BY THE POLE.

13:56.600 --> 13:57.567
-OKAY.

13:57.667 --> 13:59.300
-SO RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

13:59.400 --> 14:01.133
IF SOMEBODY CAN PLACE HIM
IN THE VEHICLE,

14:01.233 --> 14:02.300
IF HE WAS DRIVING.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.200
-SO THE GUY
IN THE STRIPED SHIRT

14:04.300 --> 14:06.767
OWNS THE VEHICLE THAT THE GUY
IN THE BLUE SHIRT WAS DRIVING?

14:06.867 --> 14:08.467
-WE DON'T KNOW
IF HE WAS DRIVING IT.

14:08.567 --> 14:10.433
-THAT WE SUSPECT
HIM DRIVING?
-CORRECT.

14:10.533 --> 14:11.800
-HOW ARE THEY RELATED
OR ARE THEY AT ALL?

14:11.900 --> 14:14.067
-WE DON'T KNOW YET.
WE JUST GOT HERE.

14:14.133 --> 14:16.067
-OKAY. LET'S SEE
WHAT THE DEAL IS.

14:16.133 --> 14:18.600
-YOU GAVE HIM PERMISSION
TO DRIVE YOUR VEHICLE?
-YES.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.433
-OKAY. WERE YOU
WITH HIM EARLIER?

14:20.533 --> 14:22.800
-I WAS WITH HIM EARLIER.

14:22.900 --> 14:23.867
-SO WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

14:23.967 --> 14:25.333
HERE, STAND THIS WAY.

14:25.433 --> 14:27.900
-STAND RIGHT THERE.
-WALK FORWARD-- I'M NOT--

14:28.067 --> 14:29.467
-OKAY, LOOK, LEAN UP
AGAINST THE CAR.

14:29.567 --> 14:30.867
LEAN UP AGAINST THE CAR.

14:30.967 --> 14:32.300
YOU'RE LEANING FORWARD.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.833
LEAN UP AGAINST THE CAR.

14:33.933 --> 14:35.933
THERE YOU GO.

14:36.067 --> 14:38.333
-WHAT GOOD IS THAT DOING ME?
-WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

14:38.433 --> 14:41.067
-WE LEFT THE BAR, UH...
-WHO'S "WE"?

14:41.167 --> 14:42.833
-WAYNE AND I.
-OKAY.

14:42.933 --> 14:44.300
-HE WAS DRIVING--
-HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM?

14:44.400 --> 14:46.467
-IS HE-- HOW IS
HE RELATED TO YOU?
-HE'S MY EX-LOVER.

14:46.567 --> 14:47.700
-OKAY, SO HE'S
YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND.

14:47.800 --> 14:51.567
-SO, UM... WE CAME UP
TO THE LIGHT, SOMEBODY--

14:51.667 --> 14:53.100
STOP SIGN.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.267
-WHO WAS DRIVING?

14:54.367 --> 14:55.800
-HE WAS DRIVING.
-OKAY.

14:55.900 --> 14:59.067
SOMEBODY CAME AND SWERVED
IN FRONT OF US.

14:59.167 --> 15:00.167
HE HIT THE CURB.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.367
-OKAY.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.767
-AND THEN WE PULLED OVER
TO THE SIDE OF THE CAR...

15:03.867 --> 15:05.133
-AND THAT'S WHERE
YOU GUYS LEFT THE CAR?

15:05.233 --> 15:06.233
RIGHT OVER HERE?

15:06.333 --> 15:07.300
OKAY.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.733
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

15:08.833 --> 15:10.433
-HE WENT THERE.

15:10.533 --> 15:13.400
HE WENT HOME
TO GET THE OTHER CAR...

15:13.500 --> 15:16.067
-OKAY.
-...AND ALSO TO CALL AAA.

15:16.100 --> 15:19.300
-OKAY.
-AND YOU GUYS SHOWED UP.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.433
-OKAY.

15:20.533 --> 15:22.867
SO, HOW MUCH HAVE YOU HAD
TO DRINK TONIGHT?

15:24.333 --> 15:26.133
-I HAVE NO CLUE.
-ALL RIGHT. COOL.

15:26.233 --> 15:28.567
JUST HANG OUT RIGHT HERE
FOR ME, OKAY?

15:28.667 --> 15:30.800
CAN YOU TELL ME EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

15:30.900 --> 15:32.067
WHO IS HE TO YOU?

15:32.100 --> 15:33.633
LIKE, DO YOU GUYS HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP TOGETHER

15:33.733 --> 15:35.933
OR ARE YOU GUYS JUST FRIENDS?
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM--

15:36.067 --> 15:37.967
-I KNOW, I KNOW,
IT LOOKS WEIRD.
IT'S REALLY WEIRD.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.433
-OKAY, SO ARE YOU GUYS, LIKE...

15:39.533 --> 15:41.567
YOU WERE DATING AT ONE POINT
AND NOW YOU'RE NOT ANYMORE?

15:41.667 --> 15:43.367
IS THAT THE THING?
-WE'RE NOT-- WE NEVER DATED.

15:43.467 --> 15:45.933
-OKAY.
-HE LIVED WITH ME
FOR 13 YEARS.

15:46.067 --> 15:49.400
-OKAY.
-IT WAS NEVER
AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP.

15:49.500 --> 15:52.067
-OKAY.
-SO, IT WASN'T LOVERS.

15:52.167 --> 15:53.233
-OKAY.

15:53.333 --> 15:56.200
-IT WAS... FRIENDS.
-OKAY.

15:56.300 --> 15:57.800
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

15:57.900 --> 15:59.867
-UM, HE LEFT.

16:00.067 --> 16:02.133
-IN-- IN-- BY HIMSELF?

16:02.233 --> 16:04.333
-YES.
-IN THE-- FROM THE BAR?

16:04.433 --> 16:05.400
-YES.
-OKAY.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.267
AND THEN WHAT VEHICLE
DID HE DRIVE?

16:07.367 --> 16:08.600
-THE SUBARU.
-OKAY.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.433
AND THEN WHERE DID
YOU GO FROM THERE?

16:10.533 --> 16:12.533
HOW DID-- DID YOU LEAVE WITH HIM
OR DID YOU HAVE TO WALK HOME?

16:12.633 --> 16:15.133
-I-- NO, I CAME HERE
BECAUSE HE CALLED ME

16:15.233 --> 16:16.433
AND SAID HE HAD A FLAT TIRE.

16:16.533 --> 16:17.467
-OKAY.

16:17.567 --> 16:19.067
AND YOU DROVE
FROM THE BAR TO HERE?

16:19.167 --> 16:20.433
-YES.
-OKAY.

16:20.533 --> 16:22.367
SO, YOUR STORY IS
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

16:22.467 --> 16:23.600
THAN WHAT HE'S GIVEN US.

16:23.700 --> 16:24.800
-I KNOW.
-OKAY.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.233
AND HOW MUCH HAVE
YOU HAD TO DRINK TODAY?

16:26.333 --> 16:28.433
-I HAD FOUR DRINKS.
-WHAT WERE THEY?

16:28.533 --> 16:30.233
-SCOTCH.
-YOU HAD FOUR SCOTCHES?

16:30.333 --> 16:32.567
-SO WE'RE DONE WITH ME?
-FOR NOW.

16:32.667 --> 16:35.200
MY PARTNER IS GONNA DO
SOME FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS
IN A SECOND.

16:35.300 --> 16:36.733
ALL RIGHT?
-ALL RIGHT.

16:38.567 --> 16:39.967
-BOTH OF THESE CARS BELONG

16:40.067 --> 16:41.500
TO THE GENTLEMAN
IN THE STRIPED SHIRT.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.200
-YEAH.
-HE SHOWED UP IN THIS ONE

16:43.300 --> 16:47.133
AFTER SUPPOSEDLY
THEY WERE IN THIS VEHICLE

16:47.233 --> 16:48.367
AND HAD GOTTEN
INTO AN ACCIDENT,

16:48.467 --> 16:50.233
AND THIS IS EXACTLY
WHERE THEY HIT THE CURB.

16:50.333 --> 16:51.867
SUPPOSEDLY, A CAR PULLED OUT
IN FRONT OF THEM

16:51.967 --> 16:53.700
AND THAT'S WHEN THEY SWERVED
AND HIT THE CURB.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.400
-Officer:
COME BACK HERE!
OKAY? YOU STAY BACK THERE!

16:55.500 --> 16:57.067
-WHAT-- WHAT ARE YOU TAKING
YOUR SHIRT OFF FOR?

16:57.167 --> 16:58.200
-I WAS GONNA WIPE HIS--

16:58.300 --> 16:59.767
HIS-- I--

16:59.867 --> 17:01.233
HIS NOSE IS RUNNING.

17:01.333 --> 17:02.533
-BUT WHY ARE YOU
TAKING OFF YOUR SHIRT?

17:02.633 --> 17:04.067
-'CAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY TISSUES,

17:04.100 --> 17:06.100
SO I WAS GONNA WIPE IT
ON MY SHIRT. I'M SORRY.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.100
-OKAY. WELL, I APPRECIATE IT.
SO LET ME--

17:08.200 --> 17:10.200
-I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.
-CAN I HAVE A TISSUE?

17:10.300 --> 17:12.100
-WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
RIGHT NOW, NO.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.933
I DON'T HAVE TISSUES,
SO WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.067
-I HAVE THEM IN MY CAR.

17:15.100 --> 17:16.333
CAN I GO AND GET THEM?
-NO. NO.

17:16.433 --> 17:18.067
JUST RIGHT NOW.
HE'S NOT GONNA GET HURT.

17:18.100 --> 17:19.800
-BUT IT'S HURTING ME.
-OKAY.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.533
-WELL, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU FEEL...
-(plop)

17:21.633 --> 17:23.267
-WELL, NOW HIS TEETH
JUST DROPPED OUT.

17:24.467 --> 17:25.600
ALL RIGHT.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.300
-(overlapping chatter)
-OH MY GOD.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.833
GONNA PUT THEM
RIGHT ON THE CAR.

17:28.933 --> 17:29.967
-IF THEY'RE GONNA ARREST YOU,

17:30.067 --> 17:32.900
THEN YOU HAVING MY TEETH
DOES NO GOOD.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.333
-I CAN GO AND GET TISSUES.

17:36.433 --> 17:37.667
-ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.
RIGHT OVER HERE.

17:37.767 --> 17:39.433
-ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE BACK.

17:39.533 --> 17:41.067
-YOU WERE DRIVING THE SUBARU.

17:41.100 --> 17:42.567
THEY MIGHT ARREST YOU.

17:42.667 --> 17:44.567
-HE'S SAYING THAT
YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP AT ALL.

17:44.667 --> 17:45.800
-WE'VE HAD A RELATIONSHIP.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.567
-HOW DID THE RELATIONSHIP END?
ACCORDING TO HIM--

17:47.667 --> 17:50.700
-I CAME OUT HERE,
HE WAS SCREWING AROUND,

17:50.800 --> 17:52.267
AND I SAID, "BYE."

17:52.367 --> 17:54.667
-OH, OKAY.
SO, YOU LEFT HIM.
-MM-HMM.

17:54.767 --> 17:56.633
-WHAT BROUGHT YOU GUYS
BACK TOGETHER TODAY?

17:56.733 --> 17:58.133
-WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS.

17:58.233 --> 17:59.667
-YOU'VE BEEN WHAT?
-FRIENDS.

17:59.767 --> 18:00.900
-OKAY, SO YOU'VE BEEN FRIENDS.

18:01.067 --> 18:02.767
SO TODAY, YOU GUYS MET UP
AT THE BAR AS FRIENDS?

18:02.867 --> 18:03.933
-MM-HMM.
-OKAY--

18:04.067 --> 18:05.633
-ACTUALLY, WE DIDN'T MEET
AT THE BAR.

18:05.733 --> 18:07.367
-WHERE'D YOU GUYS MEET UP AT?
-HE PICKED ME UP.

18:07.467 --> 18:10.600
-SO DID HE HIT THE CURB
OR DID YOU HIT THE CURB?
-HE HIT THE CURB.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.700
IF YOU'RE GONNA ARREST
EITHER ONE OF US,

18:12.800 --> 18:14.333
PLEASE ARREST ME, NOT HIM.

18:14.433 --> 18:17.200
-OKAY. SO, YOU'D RATHER
TAKE THE CHARGE FOR HIM
THAN HIM GO?

18:17.300 --> 18:19.367
-YEAH.
-YEAH? OKAY.

18:19.467 --> 18:21.700
-ALL RIGHT, SIR,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST TODAY

18:21.800 --> 18:23.633
FOR DRIVING
UNDER THE INFLUENCE.

18:23.733 --> 18:25.933
-YEP. I FIGURED THAT'S
WHAT YOU WERE GONNA SAY.

18:26.067 --> 18:28.300
-OKAY. LET'S GO AHEAD
AND TAKE A WALK TO MY CAR, SIR.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.567
GO AHEAD AND STAND UP
AGAINST MY VEHICLE RIGHT HERE.

18:30.667 --> 18:32.467
-I HATE THAT IT, YOU KNOW,
THAT IT HAS TO COME TO THIS,

18:32.567 --> 18:34.267
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND IS GONNA

18:34.367 --> 18:36.400
BE GOING TO JAIL TONIGHT
FOR DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE.

18:36.500 --> 18:40.533
-WELL, THIS AFTERNOON,
I'M GOING TO JAIL ALSO, RIGHT?

18:40.633 --> 18:42.500
-WHAT'S THAT?
-I'M GOING TO JAIL ALSO.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.967
-NO, NOT AT THIS TIME. NO.

18:44.067 --> 18:45.867
-(sighs)

18:45.967 --> 18:47.500
-WE'RE GONNA COME BACK
IN A COUPLE MINUTES HERE

18:47.600 --> 18:48.933
AND WE'RE GONNA
LET YOU GO, OKAY?

18:49.067 --> 18:51.100
-YEAH. I GOT
OTHER PEOPLE TO TAKE
THE CARS TO THE HOUSE.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.833
-OKAY. WELL, THAT'S AWESOME.
-AND I'LL BAIL HIM OUT.

18:52.933 --> 18:54.133
-OKAY. WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.400
I'LL LET HIM KNOW THAT
YOU'RE GONNA BAIL HIM OUT, OKAY?

18:56.500 --> 18:58.267
TRY AND PUT
YOUR SHOE BACK ON HERE.

18:58.367 --> 19:00.333
YOU WANT TO COME

19:00.433 --> 19:02.567
TO YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND HERE?

19:02.667 --> 19:03.767
-I HAVE A GOOD LAWYER.

19:03.867 --> 19:06.067
I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

19:06.167 --> 19:07.400
I LOVE YOU.

19:13.433 --> 19:16.067

-ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD AND STEP
WITH MY PARTNER, OKAY?
-COME ON.

19:21.133 --> 19:23.300
-I'VE NEVER BEEN ARRESTED
IN MY LIFE.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.067
-I KNOW THAT.

19:25.100 --> 19:26.533
-YOU CAN PUT HIM AWAY.
-OKAY.

19:26.633 --> 19:29.233
-THE GUY I LOVE IS IN THE BACK
OF A-- OF A PATROL CAR!

19:29.333 --> 19:31.333
HE'S ABOUT TO GET ARRESTED.
I'M UPSET.

19:31.433 --> 19:33.333
-OKAY. WELL, I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE UPSET.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.367

19:41.100 --> 19:42.400
-I UNDERSTAND.

19:43.433 --> 19:44.800
