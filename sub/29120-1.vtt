02:49.343 --> 02:50.387
Hello?

02:50.431 --> 02:51.736
My father died...

02:52.520 --> 02:53.521
again.

03:07.926 --> 03:10.842
- Embassy.
-Access code 2-2...

03:10.886 --> 03:13.280
It was 2-2-4-5-4.
Does it still work?

03:16.152 --> 03:17.197
Yes.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.415
I need a trace on a call

03:18.459 --> 03:20.243
that I just got on my cell
a minute ago.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.723
Okay.

03:32.342 --> 03:34.431
-Hello?

03:34.475 --> 03:36.172
She just called you.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.826
I don't know what's going on.

03:37.869 --> 03:39.393
We need you here
in Tel Aviv immediately.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.221
Are you fucking kidding?
Just tell me what's going on.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.353
Not over the phone.
You have to fly in.

03:43.397 --> 03:45.268
No, no, that...
that's not gonna happen.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.443
I'll meet you here.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.665
Thomas, it's Joe.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.275
Jesus!
They brought you in?

03:52.319 --> 03:53.450
They did.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.714
How are you, Joe? How's Netta?

03:56.758 --> 03:58.977
She's fine.
Still in remission.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.849
Listen, Thomas,
the situation is getting--

04:00.892 --> 04:02.372
I'm not flying anywhere, Joe.

04:02.416 --> 04:03.895
You don't have to fly anywhere.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.288
There's a safe house in Cologne.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.463
They'll give you the details.

04:06.507 --> 04:07.508
I'm heading there now.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.511
Thanks for coming
on such a short notice.

04:10.554 --> 04:11.816
-I'm Daniel.
-Thomas.

04:25.221 --> 04:26.527
- Hi.
-Hi.

04:29.051 --> 04:30.052
I remember.

04:41.759 --> 04:42.978
Why did she call you?

04:43.021 --> 04:44.240
I don't know.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.502
Why did she call you?

04:45.546 --> 04:46.895
- She knows you're out?
-I don't know.

04:46.938 --> 04:48.462
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on?

04:53.118 --> 04:55.338
She said, "My father died.
Again." And hung up.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.560
What does it mean?

04:59.603 --> 05:01.605
"Her father dying"
was her pullout code from Iran.

05:01.649 --> 05:02.867
Did her father really die?

05:08.699 --> 05:10.745
Her father died four days ago,
near London.

05:10.788 --> 05:13.400
She slipped out of Israel,
attended his funeral,

05:13.443 --> 05:14.966
and disappeared
right after that.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.098
Disappeared?

05:18.753 --> 05:19.971
She could be anywhere now.

05:25.629 --> 05:26.891
I'm only talking to Joe.

05:29.503 --> 05:30.678
I'm only talking to Joe.

05:30.721 --> 05:31.940
-He's on his way.
- He's retired.

05:31.983 --> 05:33.202
Yeah, so am I. For fuck's sake,

05:33.245 --> 05:35.378
you had him call me,
I'm only talking to him.

05:56.312 --> 05:57.357
Whatever, Thomas.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.749
Are you pulling me out?

05:58.793 --> 05:59.837
No.

06:03.624 --> 06:04.886
Are you pulling me out?

06:04.929 --> 06:05.930
No.

06:08.237 --> 06:10.021
You always wanted
to get your hands on him.

06:10.065 --> 06:11.371
But you got your hands on him.

06:11.414 --> 06:14.199
-See how that worked out.
-Fuck you.

06:19.901 --> 06:21.555
Isn't it nice to be needed?

06:21.598 --> 06:23.644
I've been waiting for this call
ever since you graduated.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.472
-Hey, watch out.
-You can have this room.

06:25.515 --> 06:26.777
Anything you need,
we will be right here.

06:26.821 --> 06:27.865
Mm-hm.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.524
Listen, until the call
this morning,

06:34.568 --> 06:36.308
I hadn't heard from her
in over a year.

06:36.352 --> 06:38.398
Thomas, nobody is blaming you
for anything.

06:38.441 --> 06:41.009
This is about assessing
her motives.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.445
You were the person
closest to her.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.273
You're crucial.

06:44.316 --> 06:46.449
Look, let's just go over this,
step by step.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.190
Let them do the grunt work.

06:48.233 --> 06:50.410
We need to get into her head.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.368
We have an advantage over them.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.109
You know her and I know you.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.901
Do you consider yourself Jewish?

07:06.600 --> 07:08.428
My father was half Jewish.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.473
I read in your file
that you were adopted.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.823
Is that relevant?

07:12.867 --> 07:15.260
Do you know who
your biological parents were?

07:15.304 --> 07:17.175
Mm-mm.

07:17.219 --> 07:19.090
Were you brought up Christian
by your mother?

07:20.788 --> 07:22.050
To some extent.

07:23.355 --> 07:24.531
We should develop that.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.056
When they assigned her to me,

07:28.099 --> 07:31.276
she was working out of Leipzig, doing basic stuff.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.583
It was my idea
to send her to Tehran,

07:33.627 --> 07:34.889
get her into
the nuclear division.

07:36.238 --> 07:37.674
It wasn't easy
to convince HQ.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.676
She did have
a very unusual biography

07:39.720 --> 07:40.982
for a Mossad operative.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.070
Born in London.

07:42.113 --> 07:43.637
Her father, a British citizen.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.030
Her mother, German,
a Christian Baptist,

07:46.074 --> 07:48.903
who died when Rachel was 12.

07:48.946 --> 07:50.687
I don't remember much
of London.

07:51.819 --> 07:52.950
What I think I remember

07:52.994 --> 07:55.387
is probably
from pictures I saw later.

07:55.431 --> 07:57.041
We moved to Boston
when I was six,

07:57.085 --> 07:58.608
Canada when I was twelve.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.218
That's when my mom
started chemo.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.047
So where are you from?

08:06.050 --> 08:09.576
Only place
I've ever felt at home,

08:09.619 --> 08:11.665
at least for a moment,
is Israel.

08:13.231 --> 08:14.276
Why?

08:15.320 --> 08:16.626
I don't know.

08:16.670 --> 08:19.063
You know, my mom
always used to talk about it.

08:19.107 --> 08:22.023
She volunteered
in a kibbutz there in the '70s.

08:22.066 --> 08:24.373
It was a big thing for Germans
to do at that time.

08:26.418 --> 08:27.463
Have you ever lived there?

08:32.207 --> 08:33.730
She was in a relationship

08:33.774 --> 08:35.775
with an Israeli medical student she'd met in London.

08:35.818 --> 08:37.517
That was her first time
in the country.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.169
When they split up, she stayed.

08:39.214 --> 08:42.565
She had no real plans. She was kind of a drifter.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.174
When she extended her work visa,

08:44.219 --> 08:46.134
someone
in the organization noticed.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.223
I mean, she immediately
attracted attention,

08:48.266 --> 08:49.354
passports,

08:49.398 --> 08:50.878
language skills.

08:50.921 --> 08:53.054
A lack of any center
or real roots anywhere.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.578
The recruiter got a sense

08:55.622 --> 08:57.711
that she was eager to belong.

08:57.754 --> 09:00.844
Eager to do
something significant.

09:03.455 --> 09:05.327
We gave her
a fully authenticated

09:05.370 --> 09:06.850
Australian passport.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.939
Built her a whole new identity
around that.

09:08.983 --> 09:11.463
Early years near Sydney,
growing up in Canada.

09:11.507 --> 09:14.641
She spent a year in Leipzig
establishing that identity.

09:15.772 --> 09:16.904
Her cover,

09:16.947 --> 09:19.036
an English and French teacher.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.690
- Hello.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.881
Her first assignment

09:37.925 --> 09:39.709
was to get a work permit
in Tehran,

09:39.753 --> 09:42.451
sponsored by
a local language school there.

09:42.494 --> 09:45.019
For a Mossad operative
to enter Iran so early

09:45.062 --> 09:46.542
in their career is unusual,

09:46.586 --> 09:48.413
but I had confidence in her.

09:59.381 --> 10:00.948
This making you uncomfortable?

10:00.991 --> 10:01.992
Mm-mm.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.911
Primary screening
is about 30 seconds.

10:07.955 --> 10:10.131
If you got a secondary,
that's hours.

10:10.174 --> 10:13.264
A secondary can be triggered
by nervousness

10:13.308 --> 10:14.918
or any kind of inconsistency.

10:14.962 --> 10:17.965
So luggage, length of stay,
profession, ticket class,

10:18.008 --> 10:19.531
they all have to match.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.229
You shouldn't look like

10:21.272 --> 10:23.318
you've just stepped out
of a mall.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.538
How close are you
to your father?

10:28.758 --> 10:31.282
Why? What do you mean?

10:31.326 --> 10:32.719
You should always
establish cover

10:32.762 --> 10:34.982
with close family members
before unusual absences.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.552
Oh, we're not close.

10:40.596 --> 10:41.597
Still.

10:47.211 --> 10:48.212
What?

10:48.865 --> 10:50.301
All right.

10:50.345 --> 10:51.433
I'll do it, fine.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.482
-You live alone, don't you?

10:57.526 --> 10:58.745
Do I?

10:58.788 --> 11:00.703
Hmm, I don't know.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.358
You always schedule meetings
on weekends.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.795
Your predecessor never did.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.362
Well, I think
if it is 24-7 for you,

11:07.405 --> 11:08.624
then it should be for me, too.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.629
So even if you were married,
you'd see me on a weekend?

11:22.769 --> 11:24.684
I'm probably
not gonna sleep tonight.

11:25.554 --> 11:26.598
You're gonna do great.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.515
You're the best person
for this assignment.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.344
Thank you for saying that.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.492
-Hello.
-Hello.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.500
Know anybody in Tehran?

12:43.023 --> 12:44.198
No, uh...

12:44.241 --> 12:46.635
I e-mailed with the person
who hired me.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.553
You are staying where?

12:51.596 --> 12:52.772
Hotel Esteghlal.

13:05.349 --> 13:06.394
Hey!

13:23.628 --> 13:24.716
I'm sorry?

13:24.760 --> 13:26.283
New?

13:26.327 --> 13:29.112
Oh, some. I lost my luggage
on my flight to Berlin.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.658
- Taxi!

15:21.398 --> 15:22.573
Hello?

15:22.617 --> 15:23.966
Hello, Miss Currin.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.882
Our spa is open
and at your disposal.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.710
We also want to let you know

15:28.753 --> 15:30.538
that we have
all kinds of drinks.

15:30.581 --> 15:32.366
Not just what's in the menu,

15:32.409 --> 15:33.976
all kinds of drinks.

16:28.944 --> 16:31.338
I couldn't sleep that night.

16:31.381 --> 16:34.689
I imagined them entering,
dragging me out.

16:34.732 --> 16:37.257
I imagined being hanged.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.911
I remember thinking,
I'm all alone.

16:39.955 --> 16:41.870
You know, it's just me

16:41.913 --> 16:43.654
and the rest of the world.

16:43.698 --> 16:45.047
Everybody must know who I am.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.179
How could they not?

16:47.658 --> 16:48.746
And then I realized,

16:48.790 --> 16:50.879
as I was standing there,
peeping, that...

16:52.750 --> 16:54.926
I had nothing to hide.

16:54.970 --> 16:57.364
You know I was just that person
who came here to teach.

16:57.407 --> 16:58.452
That's it.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.062
Nothing else.

17:01.498 --> 17:03.935
I just decided
I wasn't gonna be afraid.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.200
That's a temporary work permit.

17:14.119 --> 17:17.384
Okay, file all your receipts,
I'll handle the reports.

17:17.426 --> 17:18.819
Take a couple of days off.

17:20.213 --> 17:21.257
You did good.

17:21.300 --> 17:22.301
Okay.

17:26.306 --> 17:27.611
What's that perfume?

17:29.352 --> 17:30.440
What do you mean?

17:30.484 --> 17:31.615
It's not the one you left with.

17:54.508 --> 17:55.683
Was it clear at this point

17:55.726 --> 17:57.206
that she was going to go
long-term to Iran?

17:57.250 --> 17:58.686
No.

17:58.729 --> 17:59.991
She made some contacts there

18:00.035 --> 18:03.125
and was liked
at the language school.

18:03.169 --> 18:07.303
But I needed her to be part of
one of the big operations first.

18:07.347 --> 18:10.132
I needed the higher-ups to pay attention to her.

18:10.176 --> 18:13.135
Angela, this is Stefan.
Stefan, Angela.

18:13.179 --> 18:15.006
Staying one night
in uüsseldorf,

18:15.050 --> 18:17.139
for shopping
and waiting for a flight.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.010
Your room number is 507.

18:19.054 --> 18:21.317
Already checked in.

18:21.361 --> 18:22.710
You really don't speak
any Hebrew?

18:22.753 --> 18:23.798
What's it to you?

18:26.496 --> 18:28.455
Stefan is really lousy
at cover work.

18:28.498 --> 18:29.847
So don't let him open his mouth.

18:29.891 --> 18:31.893
Security cameras
and the layout

18:31.936 --> 18:34.330
is here, here, here, and there.

18:34.374 --> 18:37.377
This is a time table
when we can access them.

18:37.420 --> 18:38.769
- And the lobby,
-Here?

18:38.813 --> 18:40.771
if you sit here,
you have the best view.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.563
How long are we supposed to stay at the bar?

18:49.606 --> 18:50.651
That's your call.

18:50.694 --> 18:51.782
Just long enough
for people there

18:51.826 --> 18:53.610
to get a sense of your presence.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.351
Aren't we supposed to talk?

18:57.136 --> 18:58.180
Even a little?

18:58.224 --> 18:59.529
This is Anton oöska.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.792
He's been helping Iran
since the '90s.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.490
Uranium enrichment program.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.492
That's the only photo
we have of him.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.407
It was probably taken
15 years ago.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.539
Positive ID is crucial.

19:09.583 --> 19:10.801
If he's in the bar tonight,

19:10.845 --> 19:12.412
you will be closest to him.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.196
There'll be another team
cross-validating

19:14.240 --> 19:16.416
with telephoto lenses.

19:16.459 --> 19:18.026
How was your practice?

19:18.069 --> 19:19.636
It was good.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.465
Uh, when I went to this corner,
people usually stood here.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.293
I could easily squeeze
in between them

19:24.337 --> 19:25.773
to get to the panel.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.818
And I wasn't even pregnant then.

19:27.862 --> 19:30.517
So elevators A, B, C, D.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.345
Text Stefan
before you get in

19:32.388 --> 19:33.911
to let him know
which elevator you're in.

19:40.396 --> 19:41.919
What if you need
to let Stefan know

19:41.963 --> 19:43.486
for any reason to abort?

19:43.530 --> 19:46.185
If I have to abort I say,
"Here you are."

19:46.228 --> 19:48.143
I exit to the right
in front of him.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.492
I take him away.

19:49.536 --> 19:50.972
He's my husband,
he was waiting for me.

19:51.015 --> 19:53.583
All goes well,
I exit to the left,

19:53.627 --> 19:54.671
get out of his shot.

19:56.934 --> 19:59.546
Now, we don't execute
at any cost.

19:59.589 --> 20:00.982
Something
is not according to plan,

20:01.025 --> 20:02.418
you have the right
to call it off.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.116
Exit?

20:05.160 --> 20:06.640
Emergency stairs.

20:06.683 --> 20:08.946
We wait here and pickup is here.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.034
Right.

21:06.003 --> 21:07.135
Miss, we're going up.

21:07.178 --> 21:08.354
-We're going up.
-Oh. Oh, up.

21:08.397 --> 21:10.181
Uh, no matter,
I take a tour with you.

21:15.056 --> 21:17.928
Uh, sorry.
Um, can you press L, please?

21:17.972 --> 21:18.973
Thank you.

21:34.771 --> 21:36.382
There you are.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.129
No, please!

23:07.560 --> 23:08.822
Hello.

23:08.865 --> 23:10.606
I'm Rachel.

23:10.650 --> 23:11.781
-Rosita.

23:11.825 --> 23:13.261
Hi.

23:18.745 --> 23:21.138
Hey!

23:21.182 --> 23:22.226
- Hi.
-Pleasure.

23:22.270 --> 23:23.532
I wanted to meet you
for a while.

23:23.576 --> 23:24.751
-I'm Ronnie.
-Pleasure.

23:24.794 --> 23:26.361
We actually met before,
once in training.

23:27.449 --> 23:28.711
This is Dan.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.017
- Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

23:30.060 --> 23:32.236
-No chance you met him before.

23:33.890 --> 23:35.239
Beautiful day.

23:35.283 --> 23:37.285
I missed the Israeli weather.

23:49.602 --> 23:51.038
It's really nice to meet you.

23:54.302 --> 23:56.435
You haven't been to Israel
since you worked with him.

23:56.478 --> 23:59.046
Oh, I work out of Germany.

23:59.089 --> 24:00.569
You didn't even visit.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.486
You should visit more

24:04.530 --> 24:06.662
to connect to the place,
to the people.

24:10.666 --> 24:11.711
You're one of us now.

24:32.209 --> 24:34.037
There aren't that
many foreigners there,

24:34.081 --> 24:36.605
so everybody's constantly trying
to help you.

24:37.388 --> 24:38.738
Prove that Iranians

24:38.781 --> 24:41.218
are not like what
Westerners imagine them to be.

24:41.262 --> 24:42.437
They can be nice

24:42.481 --> 24:45.701
to the point
of driving you crazy.

24:45.745 --> 24:48.095
Did it make it more difficult
for you to live your cover?

24:48.835 --> 24:50.140
Not really.

24:50.184 --> 24:52.621
Um, just have to learn
how to handle it.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.754
Focus on the job,
the students.

24:55.363 --> 24:56.625
Be who you are.

24:56.669 --> 24:58.540
Hmm.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.803
You're very talented.

25:00.847 --> 25:03.763
It's not easy to stand out
in our organization.

25:05.155 --> 25:06.200
How do you feel about

25:06.243 --> 25:08.158
a long-term assignment
in Tehran?

25:13.990 --> 25:15.557
Yeah, he just wanted
to look you in eye

25:15.601 --> 25:16.645
when he asked you.

25:16.689 --> 25:18.647
Danke.

25:18.691 --> 25:20.388
Didn't even know your name
till recently.

25:21.824 --> 25:23.652
Would you stay on as my handler?

25:23.696 --> 25:24.697
Of course.

25:26.481 --> 25:28.701
So did you give them
an answer yet?

25:28.744 --> 25:30.616
I was so excited
I couldn't speak.

25:32.879 --> 25:34.315
I can't believe I'm here.

25:38.754 --> 25:39.755
"Here"?

25:41.583 --> 25:43.150
Doing this, you know.

25:52.768 --> 25:54.248
It does feel different

25:54.291 --> 25:55.945
knowing that you're there
for a long time.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.340
Now, I walk around a lot.

25:59.383 --> 26:00.776
I feel like that's important,

26:00.820 --> 26:03.431
you know,
to get a sense of the city.

26:03.474 --> 26:05.868
Where things are.
How to interact with people.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.176
How not to attract attention.

26:09.219 --> 26:10.917
Keep to myself.

26:17.053 --> 26:18.664
I'm consciously making an effort

26:18.707 --> 26:20.970
to learn everyday habits here.

26:21.014 --> 26:22.015
It's getting easier.

26:29.283 --> 26:30.893
The apartment
I rented in Pasdaran

26:30.937 --> 26:32.199
is, is perfect.

26:32.242 --> 26:33.679
It's practical. I like it.

26:33.722 --> 26:35.419
It's comfortable.

26:35.463 --> 26:37.900
Makes perfect sense for a single Western woman to live there.

26:40.990 --> 26:43.819
There's lots of cafés
I like to sit in.

26:43.863 --> 26:45.386
Shops I like to shop in.

26:48.345 --> 26:49.999
You know, the more

26:50.043 --> 26:51.522
I have people around me,

26:51.566 --> 26:52.654
I feel like I belong.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.134
Rachel.

26:56.005 --> 26:58.268
Mahshid wanted
to ask you something.

27:01.532 --> 27:02.577
She wanted to know

27:02.621 --> 27:04.405
if you'd have come
dinner with us.

27:05.406 --> 27:07.582
I'd love to. Thank you.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.844
I do like it there.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.019
I like Tehran.

27:11.586 --> 27:13.414
I'm alone
most of the time, but...

27:13.457 --> 27:15.590
You know I don't feel lonely.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.809
I can't explain it.

27:22.162 --> 27:24.164
Every time I come back to Germany to see you,

27:24.207 --> 27:26.645
I feel more
and more out of place.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.516
And I can't wait
to get back to Iran.

27:29.778 --> 27:31.040
Pants.

27:31.084 --> 27:32.172
-"Pants."
-Mm-hmm.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.611
It did feel very boring at first

27:36.655 --> 27:38.613
after all the work
we've done here.

27:39.353 --> 27:40.615
But, um...

27:40.659 --> 27:43.487
You know, my work is so detailed
and fragmented.

27:43.531 --> 27:44.967
After a while,
I really realized

27:45.011 --> 27:47.753
that it helps me focus
and occupies my mind.

28:33.624 --> 28:34.713
Thank you.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.674
I'm an English teacher.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.241
Is it okay if I work here?

28:41.284 --> 28:42.590
I like to get out of the house.

28:42.633 --> 28:43.765
Sure, no problem.

29:05.526 --> 29:06.832
Look at this.

29:07.571 --> 29:08.834
It's weeks

29:08.877 --> 29:11.793
of tracking the coming and going
of Reza Vahidi.

29:11.837 --> 29:14.013
-The Minister of Defense.
-Yeah.

29:14.056 --> 29:15.144
Did she know that? Did...

29:15.188 --> 29:17.146
Did she know
who she was tracking?

29:17.190 --> 29:18.365
She had no idea.

29:20.584 --> 29:21.977
After six months carrying out

29:22.021 --> 29:23.979
small, disconnected missions
like this,

29:24.023 --> 29:26.112
I felt that her routines
were set.

29:26.155 --> 29:29.332
That her cover was stable.
That she was stable.

29:29.376 --> 29:30.986
She was ready
for the next thing.

29:33.249 --> 29:35.904
That's when we decided to approach Razavi Electronics.

29:36.775 --> 29:37.819
Farhad Razavi.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.648
"The wallet...

29:40.691 --> 29:42.519
- is gone."
- Is.

29:43.433 --> 29:44.695
"Three coins...

29:44.739 --> 29:47.263
- Are.
-...are missing."

29:47.307 --> 29:48.699
"Everyone...

29:48.743 --> 29:50.005
- Are...
- Is.

29:50.049 --> 29:52.616
-...is here."
-But "everyone" are many people.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.229
Hey, hey, hey.

29:56.272 --> 29:58.492
It's actually
a really good question, Shirin.

29:58.535 --> 30:01.451
Does anybody know
why it's "is" and not "are"?

30:01.495 --> 30:02.888
- Ali?
-Mm?

30:03.758 --> 30:04.759
You know?

30:29.915 --> 30:31.568
Come with me.

30:31.612 --> 30:34.093
My Uncle Farhad, he has a BMW.

30:34.136 --> 30:36.138
-Wow, really?
-Mm-hm.

30:36.965 --> 30:38.488
All right, well.

30:38.532 --> 30:40.229
Let's see who gets
to spot him first.

30:40.273 --> 30:41.274
Okay.

30:44.625 --> 30:45.626
Rachel?

30:56.115 --> 30:57.290
There he is.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.334
Well.

31:01.511 --> 31:03.513
-Goodbye!
- Bye, Ali!

31:05.298 --> 31:06.952
I am sorry I am late.

31:06.995 --> 31:08.997
My sister,
she called me just now.

31:09.041 --> 31:11.043
No problem.

31:11.086 --> 31:12.740
You've worked with Ali
after school?

31:13.697 --> 31:15.699
Yeah, twice a week.

31:15.743 --> 31:18.093
You give
the one-to-one lesson, too?

31:19.268 --> 31:20.922
One-on-one lessons, yeah.

31:20.966 --> 31:22.358
Wait, wait.

31:33.369 --> 31:34.588
My name is Farhad.

31:34.631 --> 31:36.677
I'm Rachel. Nice to meet you.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.940
I need your help.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.420
I think your English
is pretty good.

31:40.463 --> 31:41.508
No, I, uh...

31:41.551 --> 31:42.857
I've worked in Europe a lot.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.032
I want to...

31:44.076 --> 31:45.251
I want to be loose.

31:45.294 --> 31:46.861
- You know, free.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.558
You want to be "loose"?

31:48.602 --> 31:49.603
Uh...

31:50.299 --> 31:51.387
You see?

31:53.824 --> 31:56.958
I'm going to drop Ali
to my sister's now.

31:57.002 --> 32:00.179
Uh, maybe
you can give me lesson later?

32:00.222 --> 32:02.790
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm really busy here today.

32:02.833 --> 32:03.878
Ah.

32:03.922 --> 32:04.923
Tomorrow?

32:19.807 --> 32:20.808
Shall we begin?

32:23.332 --> 32:24.768
Tell me about yourself.

32:24.812 --> 32:27.771
No, no, no, uh...
I pay, I decide what we talk.

32:29.512 --> 32:33.560
"I'm paying, I should decide
what we talk about."

32:33.603 --> 32:35.170
Uh...

32:35.214 --> 32:36.345
If you're going to be impolite,

32:36.389 --> 32:38.434
at least express
yourself correctly.

32:38.478 --> 32:39.870
Okay.

32:39.914 --> 32:41.394
Okay.

32:41.437 --> 32:44.701
I'm paying, so I should decide
what we talk about.

32:46.007 --> 32:46.965
Very good.

32:52.753 --> 32:54.189
-Oh, yes, please. Thank you.
-Yes.

32:55.625 --> 32:56.931
What do you do?

32:56.975 --> 32:59.890
It'll help me to find out
what your needs are.

32:59.934 --> 33:01.718
You are in Iran, how long?

33:01.762 --> 33:03.416
A while.

33:03.459 --> 33:05.896
You did not learn not to ask
questions like that?

33:07.594 --> 33:10.379
"Haven't you learned
not to ask questions like that?"

33:11.990 --> 33:15.384
"Haven't you learned
not to ask questions like that?"

33:15.428 --> 33:16.995
What do you wanna talk about?

33:18.474 --> 33:19.998
Tell me about yourself.

33:20.041 --> 33:21.825
That's okay?

33:21.869 --> 33:23.044
-Mm-hm.
-Really?

33:23.088 --> 33:24.654
You just make up the rules
that suit you?

33:24.698 --> 33:25.873
I'm so sorry.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.875
The rules here are invented
to suit me.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.009
So...

33:31.835 --> 33:33.663
Tell me something.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.187
Something personal.

33:35.230 --> 33:36.840
Personal, um...

33:39.756 --> 33:40.931
I was adopted.

33:43.282 --> 33:45.762
My parents
are not my biological parents.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.068
You're born where?

33:47.112 --> 33:48.765
I was born in Australia.

33:48.809 --> 33:50.811
But we left
when I was young.

33:50.854 --> 33:52.117
Six.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.075
I grew up in Vancouver.

33:54.119 --> 33:55.337
You are lucky.

33:57.644 --> 33:59.602
You lived in different places.

33:59.646 --> 34:02.388
Yeah, well, you know...

34:02.431 --> 34:04.694
I'm jealous of people
that have a home.

34:04.738 --> 34:05.826
Place.

34:05.869 --> 34:07.393
Friends they know
since childhood.

34:08.132 --> 34:09.612
So why are you here?

34:09.656 --> 34:11.136
I was teaching in Leipzig.

34:11.179 --> 34:13.703
But honestly, it was really,
really boring and...

34:14.965 --> 34:16.010
I don't know.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.793
You know?

34:17.838 --> 34:19.969
Tehran, there's something
I really like here.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.277
Hmm.

34:22.321 --> 34:24.714
You know what it is?

34:24.757 --> 34:27.543
The people here
all have many secrets.

34:28.327 --> 34:29.763
Do they?

34:29.806 --> 34:31.764
There's too many rules in Iran.

34:31.808 --> 34:32.896
So...

34:32.940 --> 34:35.290
If, uh... If you want to drink,

34:35.333 --> 34:36.900
you keep it secret.

34:36.944 --> 34:39.554
You marry a woman who is a...

34:39.599 --> 34:41.601
You understand.
She, she had sex.

34:41.643 --> 34:43.385
-You keep it secret.

34:43.429 --> 34:44.821
If you go to a party

34:44.864 --> 34:46.780
or a cultural thing
too controversial,

34:46.822 --> 34:48.172
keep it secret.

34:48.216 --> 34:50.304
You don't want to fast
during Ramadan?

34:50.349 --> 34:52.393
Eat in secret.

34:52.438 --> 34:54.353
It's the way of life here.

34:54.396 --> 34:55.484
Like a second nature.

35:43.967 --> 35:44.968
Rachel?

35:45.012 --> 35:46.144
Hi.

35:46.187 --> 35:48.494
I wanted to see if, um...

35:48.537 --> 35:49.582
Do you wanna have tea?

35:56.284 --> 35:57.546
Are you okay?

35:59.331 --> 36:00.941
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

36:00.984 --> 36:03.770
I'm just a bit dizzy.
It's the weather.

36:03.813 --> 36:05.119
Always happens to me.

36:11.865 --> 36:13.649
It's the man from the upstairs.

36:13.693 --> 36:15.129
His son is a criminal.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.044
He often comes here to hide.

36:58.259 --> 36:59.608
Hello?

36:59.652 --> 37:00.957
There's a party tonight.

37:01.001 --> 37:02.437
Like the one I told you of.

37:03.177 --> 37:04.309
Will you come?

37:05.223 --> 37:06.746
Just like that, huh?

37:06.789 --> 37:08.313
I will pick you up.

37:08.356 --> 37:09.792
My friends want to meet you.

37:17.974 --> 37:19.759
I didn't know
I could dress like that.

37:20.716 --> 37:21.761
Hey!

37:29.595 --> 37:30.639
This is my friend Rachel.

37:30.683 --> 37:31.988
Rachel, this is Aarmeen.

37:32.032 --> 37:33.642
-Nice to meet you.

37:35.905 --> 37:37.472
-This is Bita.
-Nice to meet you.

37:37.516 --> 37:38.560
Yeah.

37:41.389 --> 37:42.695
What?

37:45.350 --> 37:47.177
These are my childhood friends,

37:47.221 --> 37:48.962
-Nawser and Zoya.
-Nice to meet you.

37:49.005 --> 37:50.833
This is Rachel? Salaam.

37:50.877 --> 37:53.749
-Welcome.
- Nice to meet you.

38:00.495 --> 38:02.323
Oh, I don't want that.

38:02.367 --> 38:04.412
-It's okay.
-It's no help, really.

38:04.456 --> 38:05.761
Rachel.

38:05.805 --> 38:06.936
Everyone does.

38:06.980 --> 38:09.069
-No, I'm, I'm good.
-Just one.

38:10.244 --> 38:11.898
If you insist, I'm leaving.

38:13.900 --> 38:15.031
Okay.

38:17.251 --> 38:18.296
Wow!

38:19.732 --> 38:21.560
Another one?

38:21.603 --> 38:24.214
It's my first time
having alcohol in Iran.

38:25.781 --> 38:28.262
Drinking is illegal here, right?

38:28.306 --> 38:31.134
Your ecstasy dealer
is also your alcohol dealer.

39:06.822 --> 39:09.347
Like this guy with the hat,
they dance.

39:10.217 --> 39:11.653
I'll go.

42:03.216 --> 42:04.260
Hey.

42:04.304 --> 42:05.435
Good morning.

42:09.744 --> 42:11.311
Is this your brother?

42:13.879 --> 42:14.880
Mm-hm.

42:45.171 --> 42:46.172
What do you care?

42:54.876 --> 42:57.139
Your father called the embassy.

42:57.183 --> 42:58.706
-Started asking questions.

43:00.578 --> 43:01.622
So I had to talk to him.

43:01.666 --> 43:03.232
Explain everything.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.758
You did what?

43:08.020 --> 43:10.892
That's private, Thomas,
all right?

43:10.936 --> 43:12.720
And that's none
of your goddamn business.

43:14.461 --> 43:16.071
He told me
you're not adopted.

43:23.775 --> 43:26.125
That was just a game, Thomas.

43:26.168 --> 43:27.953
A stupid game
I used to play as a teenager.

43:27.996 --> 43:29.215
It's nothing.

43:29.258 --> 43:30.520
You said in your file
that you're adopted.

43:32.392 --> 43:33.959
I didn't mean to lie.

43:34.002 --> 43:36.091
It's just something my friend
and I used to say in school.

43:36.135 --> 43:37.658
And I'm sure
it was written somewhere.

43:37.702 --> 43:38.790
So I just automatically--

43:38.833 --> 43:40.792
So from a teenager till now,

43:40.835 --> 43:41.923
a grown woman,

43:43.098 --> 43:44.534
you are still saying
you are adopted?

43:44.578 --> 43:46.232
-So what?
- So what?

43:47.363 --> 43:49.061
You told me you're adopted.

43:49.104 --> 43:50.671
You basically
told this organization

43:50.715 --> 43:51.977
that you are adopted.

43:52.020 --> 43:53.587
When I started working
for the Mossad,

43:53.631 --> 43:55.502
all I did was...

43:55.545 --> 43:58.505
They just used my name
to rent apartments in Berlin.

43:58.548 --> 44:01.073
All right? I never imagined
it would go this far.

44:01.116 --> 44:02.465
It was just a stupid lie.

44:02.509 --> 44:03.684
That you're still telling now.

44:03.728 --> 44:05.294
-Yes.
-Why?

44:08.297 --> 44:09.951
I don't have anything else
to say to that.

44:09.995 --> 44:11.431
God, and you don't
even seem bothered

44:11.474 --> 44:13.215
that, one, you didn't inform

44:13.259 --> 44:15.043
family member
of your association with us,

44:15.087 --> 44:16.654
which you said you would do.

44:16.697 --> 44:18.525
And, two, you've lied about
something pretty major

44:18.568 --> 44:20.005
to do with your background.

44:20.048 --> 44:21.267
Now, this job is all about

44:21.310 --> 44:22.485
being able
to be completely honest

44:22.529 --> 44:24.183
with the people
you're supposed to trust.

44:24.226 --> 44:27.186
You can lie to the world,
but in here, you tell the truth.

44:27.229 --> 44:29.492
To this organization,
you tell the truth.

44:29.536 --> 44:31.581
And to me, you tell the truth.

44:31.625 --> 44:32.844
'Cause even shitty,
little details like this,

44:32.887 --> 44:33.975
it all matters,

44:34.019 --> 44:35.455
because I have to trust you.

44:35.498 --> 44:37.500
I have to completely trust you.

44:42.418 --> 44:43.593
You're right.

44:51.340 --> 44:52.690
I'm sleeping with Farhad.

44:54.996 --> 44:56.041
You're what?

44:56.781 --> 44:57.999
I slept with him.

44:58.043 --> 44:59.784
I mean I'm still sleeping
with him, but...

45:01.220 --> 45:03.570
You were just supposed
to tutor him!

45:04.745 --> 45:06.138
You didn't report this.

45:06.181 --> 45:07.487
I'm reporting it now.

45:09.532 --> 45:10.969
That was a key moment.

45:11.012 --> 45:13.406
We suddenly realized
we couldn't control her fully.

45:13.449 --> 45:14.842
And she wanted
to make that point.

45:14.886 --> 45:16.452
She was like,
"If I wanna sleep with the guy,

45:16.496 --> 45:18.063
I'll sleep with the guy."
She had a life there.

45:18.106 --> 45:19.064
So what do you do?

45:19.107 --> 45:20.543
You let her dictate like that?

45:20.587 --> 45:21.631
You tolerate a relationship

45:21.675 --> 45:23.372
you have absolutely
no handle on?

45:23.416 --> 45:24.722
Or you pull her out?
Lose everything?

45:26.114 --> 45:27.115
What do you do?

45:45.568 --> 45:46.613
Especially not with her.

45:46.656 --> 45:48.136
What do you mean "not with her"?

45:48.180 --> 45:49.747
She was just supposed to give
the guy private lessons.

45:49.790 --> 45:51.313
We all know
what she was supposed to do.

45:51.357 --> 45:52.488
-The question is what...

46:00.192 --> 46:01.193
I'll handle it.

46:04.631 --> 46:06.241
Are they gonna start
doubting me?

46:06.285 --> 46:07.460
Of course not.

46:07.503 --> 46:08.853
They just don't like surprises.

46:15.990 --> 46:18.471
You're so good
at giving away nothing.

46:18.514 --> 46:19.777
Did you bring him
to your apartment?

46:22.736 --> 46:25.086
No, we went to a party
and back to his place.

46:30.831 --> 46:32.180
So tell me something about him.

46:34.617 --> 46:36.402
He wears more cosmetics
than I do.

46:42.843 --> 46:44.236
Razavi Electronics

46:44.279 --> 46:46.804
was a legit company
when we started.

46:47.761 --> 46:49.023
Farhad Razavi,

46:49.067 --> 46:51.199
we took him for a lightweight,
a rich playboy.

46:51.243 --> 46:52.592
But we discovered
that when the Iranians

46:52.635 --> 46:54.420
try to buy
a restricted technology,

46:54.463 --> 46:56.857
they like doing it
through legit companies.

46:56.901 --> 47:00.643
So we started steering a lot of offers towards Razavi.

47:16.398 --> 47:17.660
This was all part

47:17.704 --> 47:19.706
of operation
"Business as Usual."

47:19.749 --> 47:21.403
We were grooming
Razavi Electronics

47:21.447 --> 47:23.014
to become
an unwitting middleman

47:23.057 --> 47:25.886
between us and the Iranian Secret Service.

47:27.235 --> 47:28.976
For that,
we needed to infiltrate

47:29.020 --> 47:30.760
their internal network.

47:30.804 --> 47:33.459
It's a pretty simple task given they were a civilian company.

47:35.417 --> 47:37.767
Oh, I'm sorry,
I got lost.

47:37.811 --> 47:39.291
Do you know where the exit is?

47:39.334 --> 47:40.683
-It's there.
-Oh.

47:41.293 --> 47:42.294
Thank you.

47:42.947 --> 47:43.991
So?

47:45.427 --> 47:46.646
Can you do this work?

47:47.473 --> 47:48.735
Is that you?

47:49.910 --> 47:51.085
- How old?

47:52.608 --> 47:54.132
How much do you want per hour?

47:57.744 --> 47:59.180
Call me a cab?

47:59.224 --> 48:00.703
I will drive you.

48:00.747 --> 48:01.966
Can you wait five minutes?

48:02.009 --> 48:04.533
I'll wait for you outside.
I need some air.

48:05.273 --> 48:06.492
Hey, uh...

48:07.362 --> 48:09.974
Are people looking at me?

48:10.017 --> 48:12.454
Is it okay for an unmarried man
and an unmarried woman

48:12.498 --> 48:14.195
to be seen together?

48:14.239 --> 48:15.936
Please,
stop worrying about this.

48:15.980 --> 48:16.937
Nobody cares.

48:16.981 --> 48:18.983
Okay.

48:34.912 --> 48:36.391
That flag in your booth,

48:37.523 --> 48:38.741
is it Azerbaijan?

48:41.135 --> 48:42.354
You know the flag?

48:42.397 --> 48:44.008
Yeah.

48:44.051 --> 48:45.052
Never been there.

48:47.054 --> 48:48.273
Once, I lived there,

48:48.316 --> 48:49.578
for many years.

48:51.929 --> 48:53.234
Can I try your brand?

48:53.931 --> 48:54.932
It's strong.

48:58.283 --> 48:59.371
Thank you.

49:34.319 --> 49:36.451
Shit.

49:36.495 --> 49:38.540
If he didn't give me so much...

49:38.584 --> 49:41.021
...I would have finished
my day 30 minutes before.

49:41.065 --> 49:42.283
I'm sorry.

49:42.327 --> 49:43.937
What's...

49:43.981 --> 49:45.373
It's too much politeness,

49:45.417 --> 49:46.809
too much flattery.

49:46.853 --> 49:49.073
"How can I ever thank you?

49:49.116 --> 49:51.031
I would never dream
to trouble you."

49:51.075 --> 49:53.425
Yeah, I've wasted
half my day on this.

50:25.587 --> 50:27.676
"How can I ever thank you?

50:27.720 --> 50:29.635
I would never dream
to trouble you."

50:55.791 --> 50:57.967
Are you here by yourself
all night?

51:03.016 --> 51:04.713
That is what I'm good for.

51:05.453 --> 51:06.715
Smoking and...

51:07.629 --> 51:09.153
letting the time pass.

51:10.937 --> 51:13.026
My mom always used to say...

51:13.896 --> 51:15.376
She died of cancer.

51:15.420 --> 51:18.118
She always used to say
that we let time slip.

51:18.162 --> 51:19.902
You know, let it pass us by.

51:21.730 --> 51:23.819
My brother, same thing.

51:23.863 --> 51:27.084
He is younger,
he is going to die soon.

51:27.127 --> 51:29.390
And all he wants
is more time.

51:31.653 --> 51:33.046
And I have all the time.

51:33.090 --> 51:34.134
Too much.

51:34.178 --> 51:35.135
I don't need it.

51:35.962 --> 51:38.138
Yeah, well...

51:38.182 --> 51:39.661
A person who knows
they're about to die,

51:39.705 --> 51:41.663
that's the worst.

51:41.707 --> 51:43.578
Best to die like that.

51:44.666 --> 51:45.667
Yes.

51:49.584 --> 51:51.717
Why only have two guards?

51:51.760 --> 51:54.546
You know, switch,
play backgammon...

51:54.589 --> 51:55.764
Money.

51:55.808 --> 51:56.809
Just me.

54:20.909 --> 54:22.911
Yes. Got it!

54:22.955 --> 54:24.826
- Yes!

55:02.995 --> 55:03.996
Shit.

56:13.457 --> 56:14.458
Shit.

57:04.377 --> 57:05.987
Oh, Nima.

57:06.031 --> 57:07.815
You scared me.

57:07.859 --> 57:09.730
I got locked in the bathroom
after work today.

57:09.774 --> 57:11.384
Just got out.

57:11.428 --> 57:13.125
I'm gonna tell Farhad
about it tomorrow.

57:13.168 --> 57:14.169
Have a good night.

57:25.006 --> 57:26.443
Shit!

58:14.578 --> 58:15.927
Asleep already?

58:18.190 --> 58:19.191
Almost.

58:19.974 --> 58:21.759
Everything okay?

58:21.802 --> 58:23.238
Maybe you want
to come over?

58:24.544 --> 58:25.545
Um...

58:25.589 --> 58:26.764
I'm tired, you know.

58:26.807 --> 58:28.113
I have that early
makeup class tomorrow.

58:29.418 --> 58:31.203
That fucking class you missed.

58:31.246 --> 58:32.857
How much time
must I hear about this?

58:32.900 --> 58:34.119
See you tomorrow, okay?

58:35.729 --> 58:37.426
Yes, okay.

01:01:10.275 --> 01:01:12.103
- I'm sorry.

01:01:42.481 --> 01:01:43.612
Hello?

01:01:45.658 --> 01:01:47.007
Yeah, I'm working on it.

01:01:48.922 --> 01:01:50.924
I need a minute, Ronnie,
all right? Back off.

01:02:03.807 --> 01:02:05.156
You know,
they're waiting for us.

01:02:07.288 --> 01:02:09.160
You're trying to make
a fool of me?

01:02:09.203 --> 01:02:11.379
Maybe you are a fool.

01:02:11.423 --> 01:02:13.207
Maybe you all are.

01:02:13.251 --> 01:02:14.252
Excuse me?

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.520
Why didn't anyone tell me

01:02:21.563 --> 01:02:23.870
that the system,
like any Windows system,

01:02:23.914 --> 01:02:26.307
might try an automatic update?

01:02:26.351 --> 01:02:28.005
You know,
I follow your protocols

01:02:28.048 --> 01:02:30.355
like a fucking robot
assuming you know everything.

01:02:30.398 --> 01:02:32.313
But you don't.

01:02:32.357 --> 01:02:34.794
I reviewed all the data
from SIGINT.

01:02:34.838 --> 01:02:36.883
Everyone is sure the guard OD'd.

01:02:36.927 --> 01:02:39.625
Police, Razavi Electronics,
everyone.

01:02:40.974 --> 01:02:42.497
That's not what I mean.

01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:43.977
This is war.

01:02:44.021 --> 01:02:45.936
No, it's not like war.
It is war.

01:02:45.979 --> 01:02:47.894
And in war, innocent people die.

01:02:54.205 --> 01:02:55.249
Look.

01:02:55.293 --> 01:02:56.642
-If we...

01:03:00.167 --> 01:03:02.474
If we were in that meeting,
you would understand

01:03:02.517 --> 01:03:04.258
the significance
of what you've done

01:03:04.302 --> 01:03:06.347
and how everyone appreciates it.

01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:07.827
I am really impressed

01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:11.135
by your ability to cope
with unexpected situations.

01:03:11.178 --> 01:03:13.746
That's the reason we're able
to let you be out there alone.

01:03:18.838 --> 01:03:20.492
How's your Hebrew?

01:03:20.535 --> 01:03:22.015
What?

01:03:22.059 --> 01:03:24.757
It's shit.

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:27.368
They take the piss out of me
when I speak it, so I don't.

01:03:27.412 --> 01:03:28.979
Is that why
they assigned you to me?

01:03:30.067 --> 01:03:31.982
The outsiders?

01:03:32.025 --> 01:03:33.635
A British Jew
living in Germany.

01:03:33.679 --> 01:03:35.463
Working for a country
that's not his.

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.955
How does someone with such
a tenuous connection to Israel

01:03:48.999 --> 01:03:51.001
to the cause,
get to be at the heart

01:03:51.044 --> 01:03:52.306
of one of the most
sensitive operations?

01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:54.482
Not tenuous. Not tenuous.

01:03:54.526 --> 01:03:55.875
Unusual.

01:03:55.919 --> 01:03:57.181
You're all doing
what they've been doing

01:03:57.224 --> 01:03:58.051
all along.

01:03:58.095 --> 01:03:59.226
Thinking of her a foreigner

01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:01.272
that we can use
and not one of us.

01:04:01.315 --> 01:04:02.534
Am I?

01:04:02.577 --> 01:04:04.318
She didn't get
to a sensitive place.

01:04:04.362 --> 01:04:06.755
It became a sensitive place
because she was there.

01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:08.801
We were selling
the Iranian Government

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:10.237
nuclear technology.

01:04:10.281 --> 01:04:11.412
Defective components.

01:04:11.456 --> 01:04:12.849
Components
with tracking devices.

01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:14.938
It became the
central arena because of her.

01:04:14.981 --> 01:04:17.505
Because of us.
Because of my work with her.

01:05:38.717 --> 01:05:40.893
Fuck.

01:05:47.595 --> 01:05:50.294
Remember when we were
at the party in Niavaran?

01:05:50.337 --> 01:05:51.643
When I was dancing,

01:05:51.686 --> 01:05:53.819
you were talking to this lady
in a gold dress.

01:05:55.342 --> 01:05:57.562
Do you know her?

01:05:57.605 --> 01:05:59.216
I wanted to ask her something.

01:05:59.259 --> 01:06:00.608
I don't know these people.

01:06:00.652 --> 01:06:02.132
You don't know them?

01:06:02.175 --> 01:06:03.220
You sure?

01:06:03.263 --> 01:06:05.439
Maybe they are friends
of Nawser's.

01:06:05.483 --> 01:06:08.486
-I don't know.

01:06:15.754 --> 01:06:16.973
What are you asking?

01:06:17.016 --> 01:06:18.148
Hey, calm down.

01:06:18.191 --> 01:06:19.714
We're gonna get there.

01:06:19.758 --> 01:06:20.759
Yeah.

01:06:26.199 --> 01:06:28.332
You look very nice.

01:06:28.375 --> 01:06:29.724
Your hair is perfect.

01:06:34.164 --> 01:06:36.340
-What are you doing? Stop it.

01:06:36.383 --> 01:06:37.384
Stop it...

01:06:38.429 --> 01:06:39.604
Whatever you do,

01:06:39.647 --> 01:06:41.388
don't speak to my sisters.
All right?

01:06:41.432 --> 01:06:44.043
No, I'm serious.
Don't even listen to them.

01:06:45.566 --> 01:06:46.785
- Nice to meet you.

01:06:46.828 --> 01:06:48.526
- Hi.

01:06:48.569 --> 01:06:50.745
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:52.834
- Hello.

01:06:58.623 --> 01:06:59.711
This is Rachel.

01:06:59.754 --> 01:07:02.018
Rachel, this is Roya, Nasim.

01:07:02.061 --> 01:07:03.758
- Shiva, my sister.
- Nice to meet you.

01:07:03.802 --> 01:07:05.673
This is Maryam, Farid's wife.

01:07:05.717 --> 01:07:07.632
Farid is my older brother.

01:07:07.675 --> 01:07:11.070
He is, uh... over there.

01:07:11.114 --> 01:07:15.074
Okay, uh, I have to go
for one minute, okay?

01:07:15.118 --> 01:07:18.077
- Hi.
-So glad to finally meet you.

01:07:18.121 --> 01:07:19.339
We thought he was hiding you.

01:07:20.688 --> 01:07:22.212
-You are from Canada, right?
-Yes.

01:07:24.997 --> 01:07:27.217
Don't mind them,
they always do that.

01:07:32.526 --> 01:07:34.920
She asks if you teach
at Ali's school?

01:07:34.963 --> 01:07:36.835
Yes. Oh, you're Ali's mom?

01:07:41.796 --> 01:07:43.363
She says
that Ali told her

01:07:43.407 --> 01:07:45.583
that you teach him sometimes
afternoon.

01:07:45.626 --> 01:07:47.454
- Hm.
-So she wants to thank you.

01:07:49.195 --> 01:07:50.240
He's a great kid.

01:07:53.156 --> 01:07:55.158
You know who is that, right?

01:07:55.984 --> 01:07:57.029
No, should I?

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:58.944
Farhad's ex-wife.

01:07:58.987 --> 01:08:00.902
Well, I'm not surprised
she's here.

01:08:00.946 --> 01:08:03.557
Because her family
is friends with the groom.

01:08:07.213 --> 01:08:09.868
She and Farhad...
very bad divorce.

01:08:09.911 --> 01:08:12.000
Mm-hm, hm...

01:08:17.528 --> 01:08:20.487
He is asking
if she would marry him

01:08:20.531 --> 01:08:22.707
for 1,000 gold coins

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:24.535
and a truck full of flowers.

01:08:31.019 --> 01:08:34.979
The Meriye, it's like a gift
from the groom to the bride.

01:08:35.023 --> 01:08:36.198
She can ask it
whenever she wants.

01:08:39.984 --> 01:08:42.161
She answers
after the third time.

01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:45.729
She says, "With the permission
of my parents

01:08:45.773 --> 01:08:48.211
-and my grandparents... Yes."

01:08:56.654 --> 01:08:58.482
You didn't tell me
you were divorced.

01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:03.008
I don't like to speak of it.

01:09:04.488 --> 01:09:05.924
Did you know
she was gonna be here?

01:09:07.752 --> 01:09:09.274
Is that why
you wanted me to come?

01:09:12.278 --> 01:09:13.497
I don't mind.

01:09:14.497 --> 01:09:16.152
I want her to know you're taken.

01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:26.205
It's not just her, no.
It's her whole family.

01:09:26.249 --> 01:09:28.033
They... They don't stop
calling me.

01:09:28.076 --> 01:09:29.513
Are you having a good time?

01:09:29.555 --> 01:09:30.557
Yeah.

01:09:31.645 --> 01:09:33.037
Good.

01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:34.734
Why did you argue
with your brother?

01:09:36.955 --> 01:09:38.261
He's older.

01:09:38.304 --> 01:09:39.957
You understand.
In Iran, that matters.

01:09:40.001 --> 01:09:42.220
So he is, uh...

01:09:42.265 --> 01:09:44.832
He's in charge
of the family company and...

01:09:44.876 --> 01:09:47.705
He's always away.
I do all the work.

01:09:47.747 --> 01:09:50.273
And somehow,
still, he managed to, uh...

01:09:50.316 --> 01:09:53.189
-treat me like an employee.
- Hm...

01:09:53.232 --> 01:09:55.234
I don't want to talk about this.
Come on.

01:09:55.278 --> 01:09:56.931
You want something?
I get you chai,

01:09:56.975 --> 01:09:59.369
-gaz... I serve you. It's okay.
-No. No, really.

01:09:59.412 --> 01:10:00.674
I have to tell you something.

01:10:02.415 --> 01:10:06.071
Um, I have to fly tomorrow
to visit my father.

01:10:06.114 --> 01:10:07.942
You went to Europe
about three weeks ago.

01:10:07.986 --> 01:10:09.814
I know.
I know, but, um...

01:10:09.857 --> 01:10:11.772
They found some stones
in his kidney

01:10:11.816 --> 01:10:13.905
and, uh, he's doing
some sort of treatment.

01:10:13.948 --> 01:10:15.167
Why didn't you tell me?

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:17.125
I just learned.

01:10:17.169 --> 01:10:19.127
I think he's gonna be okay.
But, you know...

01:10:19.171 --> 01:10:21.129
I should go.

01:10:21.173 --> 01:10:23.219
You don't speak of him
very much, you know.

01:10:29.312 --> 01:10:31.792
You're from a good family.
You wouldn't understand.

01:10:41.062 --> 01:10:42.977
He's very cold, my father.

01:10:43.021 --> 01:10:44.240
Always has been.

01:10:46.067 --> 01:10:48.156
You know,
even after my mother died,

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.942
it was just, uh...
him and me, and...

01:10:51.682 --> 01:10:53.205
He was very strict.

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:54.380
Mm.

01:10:54.424 --> 01:10:56.295
Ridiculed everything I did,
you know?

01:10:57.949 --> 01:11:01.518
I felt like I had to lie
all the time and...

01:11:01.561 --> 01:11:03.694
And I would start living
in my head.

01:11:06.566 --> 01:11:08.133
I got so angry at one point,

01:11:08.176 --> 01:11:10.309
even after my mother died
that I'd...

01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:12.833
say, "How could you marry him?"

01:11:12.877 --> 01:11:15.227
You know? How could you
marry him and just...

01:11:16.707 --> 01:11:18.099
leave me with him.

01:12:24.731 --> 01:12:27.343
You're flying to Turkey
next to the Iranian border.

01:12:27.386 --> 01:12:28.866
My team will join.

01:12:28.909 --> 01:12:31.608
You're going to drive a payload
into the country.

01:12:32.826 --> 01:12:34.219
-Drive?
- Mm-hm.

01:12:34.262 --> 01:12:35.525
Through the mountains.

01:12:38.484 --> 01:12:39.529
What's the payload?

01:12:39.572 --> 01:12:40.834
Five devices.

01:12:41.705 --> 01:12:42.923
Flora Halles.

01:12:44.142 --> 01:12:45.230
German archeologist.

01:12:45.273 --> 01:12:46.840
Same age as you. Similar build.

01:12:46.884 --> 01:12:48.755
She's worked in Iran
multiple times.

01:12:48.799 --> 01:12:49.930
That will be your cover

01:12:49.974 --> 01:12:51.410
until you drop the car
in Tehran.

01:12:52.846 --> 01:12:55.545
Driving bombs
into Iran?

01:12:55.588 --> 01:12:56.850
It's your job to protect me

01:12:56.894 --> 01:12:57.938
from things
I shouldn't be doing.

01:12:57.982 --> 01:12:59.418
God,
it's a simple drive

01:12:59.462 --> 01:13:00.680
on a route that we often use.

01:13:00.724 --> 01:13:01.768
It shouldn't be a big deal.

01:13:01.812 --> 01:13:03.291
It's a fucking huge deal!

01:13:03.335 --> 01:13:04.728
Because I shouldn't be
doing this.

01:13:04.771 --> 01:13:05.772
Hey. Hey.

01:13:07.426 --> 01:13:08.862
What do you want?

01:13:08.906 --> 01:13:09.907
You wanna leave Iran?

01:13:17.262 --> 01:13:18.742
You sent a woman there,

01:13:18.785 --> 01:13:20.526
and everything's about that.

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:22.441
But it's never discussed
or spoken about.

01:13:22.485 --> 01:13:23.486
What do you mean?

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:27.533
I'm pregnant, Thomas.

01:13:33.191 --> 01:13:34.410
You have a protocol for that?

01:13:38.457 --> 01:13:39.676
Why didn't you say anything?

01:13:39.719 --> 01:13:42.200
I don't want it
on their feed.

01:13:42.243 --> 01:13:44.376
I don't want all these
fucking people to discuss it.

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:49.033
I need your help, Thomas.

01:13:49.076 --> 01:13:50.469
Quietly.

01:13:50.513 --> 01:13:52.428
-Rachel, I have to report this.
- You can't.

01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:53.864
They're gonna yank you.

01:13:53.907 --> 01:13:55.474
They're just looking
for an excuse.

01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:56.693
Well, so why are you
even telling me?

01:13:56.736 --> 01:13:59.043
Why?

01:13:59.086 --> 01:14:01.872
You're unbelievable.
What do you think I'm doing?

01:14:01.915 --> 01:14:03.613
I'm talking to you as a friend.

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.015
Thanks.

01:14:44.828 --> 01:14:46.873
So she got you
to lie for her

01:14:46.917 --> 01:14:48.222
and you proceeded with it?

01:14:48.266 --> 01:14:49.876
Ops are always doing
that sort of stuff.

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.399
"Prove you're on my side"
kind of thing.

01:14:51.443 --> 01:14:53.010
She wanted me
to transgress for her.

01:14:53.053 --> 01:14:54.794
-Aren't you downplaying this?
-Downplaying it?

01:14:54.838 --> 01:14:56.013
You know I was on a path...

01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:58.581
I knew right then and there

01:14:58.624 --> 01:14:59.843
it could destroy
my whole career.

01:14:59.886 --> 01:15:01.061
And yet you did it.

01:15:01.105 --> 01:15:02.106
Yes, I did it.

01:15:06.589 --> 01:15:07.546
Okay.

01:15:11.637 --> 01:15:14.118
She had some personal stuff
to take care of.

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:21.734
Have you told her
we're gonna run Farhad directly?

01:15:21.778 --> 01:15:24.998
And do you really think that now
is a good time to tell her?

01:15:25.042 --> 01:15:27.697
She'll need some time
to get used to the idea.

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:29.568
Can you guarantee
she'll help recruit him

01:15:29.612 --> 01:15:31.309
once she realizes
she's on her way out?

01:15:31.352 --> 01:15:32.658
-Sorry...
- No need to look at him.

01:15:32.702 --> 01:15:34.268
Look at me. I'm gonna head
"Business as Usual"

01:15:34.312 --> 01:15:35.574
starting next month.

01:15:35.618 --> 01:15:37.271
Just don't tell anyone.

01:15:37.315 --> 01:15:38.621
Hasn't been announced yet.

01:15:44.191 --> 01:15:45.497
The decision
to pull her out

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.107
changed everything.

01:15:47.151 --> 01:15:48.500
She would never have been given

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:50.154
the Turkey Border Mission
otherwise.

01:15:50.197 --> 01:15:52.330
It was as if they wanted
to signal to her, to me,

01:15:52.373 --> 01:15:53.984
that this chapter was over.

01:16:04.951 --> 01:16:06.953
This is Gulal.

01:16:06.997 --> 01:16:10.696
He and another driver
will wait for you at this point.

01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:12.350
It's in your GPS.

01:16:12.393 --> 01:16:14.657
Right here by this well.

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:17.660
He'd want to see
that you came alone.

01:16:17.703 --> 01:16:20.619
The code is,
"Archeology is good in Iran."

01:16:20.663 --> 01:16:22.055
Mm-hm.

01:16:22.099 --> 01:16:24.014
They'll drive you
through the mountains

01:16:24.057 --> 01:16:25.363
to the Iranian side.

01:16:25.406 --> 01:16:27.539
Off-road through here.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:29.019
There's no physical borders.

01:16:29.062 --> 01:16:31.674
He's from a family
of Kurdish smugglers we trust.

01:16:33.197 --> 01:16:34.546
We timed the operation

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:36.809
so you won't intercept
the Iranian Border Patrol.

01:16:37.505 --> 01:16:39.507
But, if you do,

01:16:39.551 --> 01:16:41.118
they'll deal with it.

01:16:41.161 --> 01:16:42.946
They'll hide you.
Bribe them.

01:16:42.989 --> 01:16:44.338
They do it all the time.

01:16:46.253 --> 01:16:47.254
All right.

01:16:55.045 --> 01:16:57.221
Two on this door,
three on the other.

01:16:58.439 --> 01:16:59.919
Do I leave the keys in the car?

01:16:59.963 --> 01:17:01.312
Yes.

01:17:01.355 --> 01:17:03.531
The people pick it up.
We'll take it from there.

01:17:06.012 --> 01:17:07.057
Good luck.

01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:19.771
Hey!

01:20:20.946 --> 01:20:22.034
What's your name?

01:20:28.475 --> 01:20:29.520
What's your name?

01:20:55.111 --> 01:20:56.547
Hey.

01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:58.201
-What's your name? Hey!

01:20:58.244 --> 01:20:59.506
What's your name?

01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:01.813
- No!
- "Good at Iran."

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:03.597
"Archeology good in Iran."

01:21:34.106 --> 01:21:35.238
Iran.

01:21:48.425 --> 01:21:49.426
What is it?

01:22:00.002 --> 01:22:01.177
What's going on?

01:22:03.483 --> 01:22:04.789
- Hey!

01:22:12.666 --> 01:22:14.190
What's going on?

01:22:14.233 --> 01:22:15.582
-Army Iran.
- Huh?

01:22:15.626 --> 01:22:16.757
Army Iran.

01:22:16.801 --> 01:22:17.889
Go, go, go.

01:22:18.672 --> 01:22:19.673
-Go where?
-Go.

01:22:22.894 --> 01:22:24.417
Go here.

01:22:24.461 --> 01:22:25.984
-Go here. Go here!
-I'm not going in there.

01:22:26.028 --> 01:22:27.072
I'm not going in there!

01:22:27.116 --> 01:22:28.552
Go here. Army Iran.

01:22:28.595 --> 01:22:30.162
Go here, go! Go here!

01:22:58.495 --> 01:22:59.713
Get out.

01:23:00.323 --> 01:23:02.020
Get... No!

01:23:02.064 --> 01:23:03.630
No!

01:25:03.359 --> 01:25:05.752
Stop the car! Stop the car!

01:25:05.796 --> 01:25:06.884
Stop the...

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:36.191
Damn.

01:26:46.853 --> 01:26:48.420
Fuck.

01:26:51.771 --> 01:26:53.164
Fuck.

01:28:20.904 --> 01:28:23.602
Was I talking in my sleep?

01:28:23.646 --> 01:28:25.430
Are you giving me
sleeping pills?

01:28:31.567 --> 01:28:33.220
-Farhad!

01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:35.571
Farhad!

01:28:35.614 --> 01:28:36.702
Rachel?

01:28:45.798 --> 01:28:47.234
How did this happen?

01:28:48.148 --> 01:28:50.281
They don't know anything.

01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:53.371
A bicycle ran into me
in Germany.

01:28:53.415 --> 01:28:56.069
Ugh, I didn't think
it was gonna be this bad.

01:28:56.113 --> 01:28:58.376
You had some internal bleeding.

01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:00.726
You're lucky
you had a Razavi card on you.

01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:01.814
They called me.

01:29:08.908 --> 01:29:10.997
Hm, you're going to love this.

01:29:12.608 --> 01:29:14.697
How does this work?

01:29:24.097 --> 01:29:25.098
What is it?

01:29:26.099 --> 01:29:27.231
Bombings.

01:29:28.798 --> 01:29:30.626
Iranian scientists
of the nuclear...

01:29:30.669 --> 01:29:31.931
-Scientists?
-Yeah.

01:29:31.975 --> 01:29:33.933
Two different locations
in Tehran.

01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:41.985
Fuck.

01:29:42.028 --> 01:29:43.378
What?

01:29:43.421 --> 01:29:45.075
The scientists
were with their families.

01:29:45.989 --> 01:29:47.338
Two children died.

01:30:34.994 --> 01:30:36.474
- What is it?

01:30:36.518 --> 01:30:38.258
-You're shaking.
-This fucking hospital.

01:30:38.302 --> 01:30:40.478
I can't take this anymore.

01:30:41.566 --> 01:30:43.438
I hate the smell.

01:30:43.481 --> 01:30:45.483
-I can't...

01:30:45.527 --> 01:30:47.703
I can't do this anymore.

01:30:47.746 --> 01:30:49.487
Farhad...

01:30:50.836 --> 01:30:52.447
This is not...

01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:53.709
What's wrong?

01:30:53.752 --> 01:30:55.014
I'm not...

01:30:55.058 --> 01:30:56.146
This is...

01:30:56.189 --> 01:30:57.364
I can't do this...

01:30:57.408 --> 01:31:00.063
I can't do this anymore.

01:31:05.503 --> 01:31:06.939
What, what, what?

01:31:06.983 --> 01:31:08.114
What is it?

01:31:09.725 --> 01:31:11.074
What is it?

01:32:17.444 --> 01:32:18.794
How is your father?

01:32:21.579 --> 01:32:22.754
He's fine.

01:32:22.798 --> 01:32:23.929
Yeah, much better.

01:32:25.583 --> 01:32:27.411
When is the next time
you'll visit him?

01:32:29.979 --> 01:32:31.371
Don't know. A few weeks.

01:32:31.807 --> 01:32:32.808
Why?

01:32:34.984 --> 01:32:37.595
We are constantly
getting offers now

01:32:37.639 --> 01:32:39.423
to expand our business

01:32:39.466 --> 01:32:41.556
from Belgium, Germany.

01:32:43.688 --> 01:32:47.083
But, my brother,
he doesn't like the risk

01:32:47.126 --> 01:32:49.389
because of the sanctions.

01:32:49.433 --> 01:32:50.956
But these sanctions,
they're even on

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.132
chips you need
in a goddamn toaster oven.

01:32:55.395 --> 01:32:58.398
The world
is so hypocrite about this.

01:32:58.442 --> 01:33:01.880
It's okay for Israel and America
to blow up children,

01:33:01.924 --> 01:33:04.927
but we can't have
the components for, uh...

01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:06.363
medical equipment.

01:33:09.148 --> 01:33:10.236
You can help me.

01:33:11.847 --> 01:33:12.848
Me?

01:33:16.547 --> 01:33:18.027
Next time you're in Europe,

01:33:18.984 --> 01:33:21.073
pick up some things for us.

01:33:21.117 --> 01:33:22.858
-Farhad...
-No, no, no.

01:33:22.901 --> 01:33:25.164
Computer chips.

01:33:25.208 --> 01:33:27.906
They, they look at you,
Australian passport,

01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:29.647
they're not gonna bother you.

01:33:31.562 --> 01:33:33.608
Please don't ask me to do this.

01:33:33.651 --> 01:33:35.610
Nobody will stop you.

01:33:35.653 --> 01:33:37.655
And, if they do,
we deal with it.

01:33:37.699 --> 01:33:39.396
I'm not worried about me.

01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:46.621
I don't think
you should get into this.

01:33:46.664 --> 01:33:47.665
Don't you trust me

01:33:47.709 --> 01:33:49.275
when I tell you
something is okay?

01:33:53.715 --> 01:33:55.151
I tell you...

01:33:56.239 --> 01:33:57.501
It is okay.

01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:39.021
Okay.

01:34:45.331 --> 01:34:46.768
The laptop you brought

01:34:46.811 --> 01:34:48.944
houses 20 logic controllers

01:34:48.987 --> 01:34:51.860
with our version
of the STEP 7 Software.

01:34:51.903 --> 01:34:54.079
We started circulating them
in the black market

01:34:54.123 --> 01:34:56.299
since February.

01:34:56.342 --> 01:34:57.779
What's the story
he's telling you?

01:34:59.781 --> 01:35:01.217
That it's for medical equipment.

01:35:01.913 --> 01:35:03.045
Good.

01:35:06.788 --> 01:35:08.311
So he's in the business now.

01:35:10.095 --> 01:35:12.184
You need to find a way
to bring him here.

01:35:12.968 --> 01:35:14.491
Here? To Leipzig?

01:35:15.971 --> 01:35:17.059
Why?

01:35:18.321 --> 01:35:19.975
I mean, why would he?

01:35:20.018 --> 01:35:21.063
The whole point is that

01:35:21.106 --> 01:35:22.368
I carry that stuff
for him, right?

01:35:25.676 --> 01:35:27.417
He's not cut out for this.

01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:29.245
He's like a kid
trying to prove himself.

01:35:29.288 --> 01:35:30.333
He's already used you

01:35:30.376 --> 01:35:31.987
to smuggle
restricted technology.

01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:33.728
Because we seduced him into it

01:35:33.771 --> 01:35:35.555
with all these offers
from our companies.

01:35:36.556 --> 01:35:37.601
Whatever, Thomas.

01:35:37.644 --> 01:35:39.124
Are you pulling me out?

01:35:39.168 --> 01:35:40.343
No.

01:35:45.609 --> 01:35:47.132
Are you pulling me out?

01:35:47.176 --> 01:35:48.960
No.

01:35:49.004 --> 01:35:50.875
We're gonna approach him
as a German company

01:35:50.919 --> 01:35:54.052
seeking to do business
with Razavi Electronics.

01:35:55.053 --> 01:35:56.359
When he lands,

01:35:56.402 --> 01:35:58.013
I want you to take him
to a French restaurant

01:35:58.056 --> 01:35:59.492
called, "Chez Henriette."

01:35:59.536 --> 01:36:01.059
Eat. Someone will join you.

01:36:01.103 --> 01:36:03.018
Who? You?

01:36:03.061 --> 01:36:05.194
You always wanted
to get your hands on him.

01:36:05.237 --> 01:36:06.717
But you got your hands on him.

01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:08.545
-See how that worked out.
-Fuck you.

01:36:31.133 --> 01:36:32.264
Suits you.

01:36:34.049 --> 01:36:35.093
You like it?

01:36:47.062 --> 01:36:48.150
Made a reservation

01:36:48.193 --> 01:36:51.414
at my favorite French restaurant
in town.

01:36:51.457 --> 01:36:53.590
I ate on the train.
I'm not hungry now.

01:36:56.636 --> 01:36:57.942
Okay...

01:36:57.986 --> 01:37:00.292
Well, I'm hungry.
Are you gonna come with me?

01:37:08.083 --> 01:37:09.475
What is it, Farhad?

01:37:12.217 --> 01:37:15.264
Did you go to an abortion place
in Tehran last month?

01:37:17.005 --> 01:37:18.833
I...

01:37:22.837 --> 01:37:23.838
I did.

01:37:26.144 --> 01:37:28.407
I'm sorry.
I should've told you, all right?

01:37:29.365 --> 01:37:30.627
My period was late.

01:37:30.670 --> 01:37:32.759
I freaked out.
I just went to some place and...

01:37:34.544 --> 01:37:36.067
I wouldn't have done anything
without you.

01:37:36.111 --> 01:37:37.199
I got scared.

01:37:37.242 --> 01:37:38.635
And then my period came
the next day,

01:37:38.678 --> 01:37:39.679
it was false alarm.

01:37:39.723 --> 01:37:41.116
So you're going
to get rid of this

01:37:41.159 --> 01:37:42.682
without me ever knowing.

01:37:42.726 --> 01:37:43.988
No.

01:37:44.032 --> 01:37:45.294
Of course not.

01:37:47.426 --> 01:37:50.429
I can never tell
what is going on behind your...

01:37:52.692 --> 01:37:54.781
I'm not pregnant.

01:37:54.825 --> 01:37:56.827
I was never pregnant, all right?

01:37:56.871 --> 01:37:58.263
We're all hiding stuff.

01:37:58.307 --> 01:37:59.656
-You too.

01:37:59.699 --> 01:38:01.571
-What do you mean "you too"?

01:38:01.614 --> 01:38:03.921
-Now, who's wearing...
-What do you mean "you too"?

01:38:03.965 --> 01:38:05.792
Farhad, I live in a country

01:38:05.836 --> 01:38:07.403
where I don't speak
the language, all right?

01:38:07.446 --> 01:38:08.839
And the only person I know
is you.

01:38:08.883 --> 01:38:10.058
What do you think
that feels like?

01:38:10.101 --> 01:38:11.929
-Hello?
- Your father died.

01:38:11.973 --> 01:38:13.888
What?

01:38:13.931 --> 01:38:16.281
-No, we're going to... -You heard what I said.

01:38:16.325 --> 01:38:17.717
But we're going for lunch.

01:38:17.761 --> 01:38:19.937
Exit now.
We're on our way up.

01:38:19.981 --> 01:38:20.938
What is it?

01:38:23.201 --> 01:38:25.116
What is it?

01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:27.510
Farhad, I... I have to make
a phone call.

01:38:27.553 --> 01:38:29.381
My father...

01:38:29.425 --> 01:38:30.948
Just wait for me here,
all right?

01:38:30.992 --> 01:38:32.428
I'll... I'll be right back.

01:38:40.262 --> 01:38:41.524
Son of a bitch.

01:38:43.265 --> 01:38:44.614
Rachel.

01:38:44.657 --> 01:38:47.008
- Hey, what are you...

01:38:55.103 --> 01:38:56.626
English?

01:38:56.669 --> 01:38:58.628
You're involved in a plot
to carry items

01:38:58.671 --> 01:39:01.413
that violate the sanctions
against Iran.

01:39:01.457 --> 01:39:03.372
Your lady friend is going
to appear before a judge

01:39:03.415 --> 01:39:04.677
and go to jail.

01:39:04.721 --> 01:39:06.375
So will you.

01:39:06.418 --> 01:39:08.681
We will also implicate
your company.

01:39:08.725 --> 01:39:10.596
What happens from now on,

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:12.076
it's really all up to you.

01:39:20.693 --> 01:39:23.392
Did you try to terminate
a pregnancy in Tehran?

01:39:27.091 --> 01:39:28.788
Did Thomas know about this?

01:39:56.642 --> 01:39:58.383
I answered
this question already.

01:40:01.343 --> 01:40:03.432
I did, yes.
But she refused to talk to me.

01:40:03.475 --> 01:40:04.607
Why did you call her?

01:40:04.650 --> 01:40:06.043
I wanted to see how she's doing.

01:40:06.087 --> 01:40:08.480
Helping her conceal
her pregnancy ended your career.

01:40:08.524 --> 01:40:10.047
-Weren't you angry?
-What? With her?

01:40:11.527 --> 01:40:12.745
Because I was very involved
in her life.

01:40:12.789 --> 01:40:14.182
You stopped giving a shit.

01:40:14.225 --> 01:40:15.835
You threw her away.
You choose she's no use anymore.

01:40:15.879 --> 01:40:17.402
Oh, so now it's our fault.

01:40:19.491 --> 01:40:21.363
What did she do
in her year in Israel?

01:40:25.236 --> 01:40:26.324
Probably trying
to contact Farhad

01:40:26.368 --> 01:40:27.412
or get information about him.

01:40:27.456 --> 01:40:28.892
Farhad is not in Tehran anymore.

01:40:28.935 --> 01:40:30.459
Look at this.

01:40:30.502 --> 01:40:31.938
After burying her father,
she gave an interview to this...

01:40:31.982 --> 01:40:33.157
I don't know, local town paper.

01:40:33.201 --> 01:40:35.159
She got her picture
in the fucking paper.

01:40:35.203 --> 01:40:36.421
This is two days ago.

01:40:36.465 --> 01:40:38.423
She also filed for a taxpayer ID
in England.

01:40:38.467 --> 01:40:40.164
She's upping
her British identity profile.

01:40:40.208 --> 01:40:41.252
Why would she do that?

01:40:41.296 --> 01:40:42.993
-Isn't it obvious?
- No!

01:40:43.037 --> 01:40:45.039
To make it harder for you
to fuck with her on
European soil.

01:41:27.385 --> 01:41:29.474
Farhad is still part
of "Business as Usual."

01:41:29.518 --> 01:41:30.649
He lives in Germany.

01:41:30.693 --> 01:41:31.737
We're running false flag.

01:41:31.781 --> 01:41:32.999
He thinks he works
for the Germans.

01:41:33.043 --> 01:41:34.175
Did you know that?

01:41:34.218 --> 01:41:35.350
No.

01:41:35.393 --> 01:41:36.699
Is she trying to meet him?

01:41:36.742 --> 01:41:37.787
Seems so.

01:41:38.701 --> 01:41:40.181
But there's much more going on.

01:41:45.142 --> 01:41:46.230
She spent a day
in Switzerland

01:41:46.274 --> 01:41:47.318
after leaving London.

01:41:47.362 --> 01:41:48.624
Which passport is she using?

01:41:48.667 --> 01:41:49.712
Her real one.

01:41:49.755 --> 01:41:50.887
How did she leave Israel

01:41:50.930 --> 01:41:52.236
without getting flagged
at the airport?

01:42:14.998 --> 01:42:16.391
We're not there yet.

01:42:16.434 --> 01:42:17.783
She's threatening
the entire operation.

01:42:17.827 --> 01:42:18.915
We have no choice.

01:42:18.958 --> 01:42:20.308
After all she has done for us?

01:42:20.351 --> 01:42:21.570
She's an operative.

01:42:21.613 --> 01:42:23.093
She's not just some asset
you can discard.

01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:24.616
We're trying
to make contact with her.

01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:26.009
Once we do,
we'll put you on the phone...

01:42:26.052 --> 01:42:27.402
No, no, no. Please...

01:42:27.445 --> 01:42:29.621
Let me be the first one
to make contact with her.

01:42:29.665 --> 01:42:30.753
I'll talk her out of Germany.

01:42:30.796 --> 01:42:32.146
But face-to-face.

01:42:32.189 --> 01:42:33.843
I'll get her out.
No shots fired,

01:42:33.886 --> 01:42:35.323
no mess to clean up.

01:42:56.605 --> 01:42:58.259
So...

01:42:58.302 --> 01:43:00.086
They think
if they send you, you...

01:43:00.130 --> 01:43:02.219
can convince me
to recruit my brother?

01:43:05.135 --> 01:43:06.180
Is that what they're...

01:43:07.616 --> 01:43:08.617
No.

01:43:09.531 --> 01:43:10.793
I'm not with them anymore.

01:43:11.489 --> 01:43:12.534
You don't.

01:43:13.796 --> 01:43:15.363
- No.
-How did you find me?

01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:19.105
It took a really long time.

01:43:28.767 --> 01:43:31.161
-I'm sorry.
- Stop, please.

01:43:32.162 --> 01:43:33.511
I made my own mess.

01:43:34.338 --> 01:43:35.774
I was too eager.

01:43:38.951 --> 01:43:40.736
You know, in the beginning, I...

01:43:40.779 --> 01:43:42.172
I was sure that...

01:43:43.042 --> 01:43:45.306
I brought trouble to you.

01:43:45.349 --> 01:43:47.656
You disappeared,
they told me you were in jail

01:43:47.699 --> 01:43:49.266
because of the things
you brought back

01:43:49.310 --> 01:43:50.702
that I told you to bring.

01:43:51.921 --> 01:43:54.489
I tried to make a deal with them

01:43:55.316 --> 01:43:56.491
to release you.

01:43:59.189 --> 01:44:01.887
Only after many months,
I realized...

01:44:01.931 --> 01:44:03.149
you were with them.

01:44:06.501 --> 01:44:07.763
Everything that was between us

01:44:07.806 --> 01:44:08.807
was for them?

01:44:11.984 --> 01:44:13.508
Everything was a lie?

01:44:20.341 --> 01:44:21.559
What do you want?

01:44:33.310 --> 01:44:34.746
I came here to see you.

01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:38.272
And I came here
to say I'm sorry.

01:44:42.667 --> 01:44:45.061
I came here to try
and get you out of this.

01:45:04.123 --> 01:45:05.734
Keep the phone
on the table.

01:45:05.777 --> 01:45:08.563
The solution you're offering
is the only solution.

01:45:08.606 --> 01:45:10.956
You came for her.
It's the truth. Use it.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.306
I know, Joe. I will.

01:45:50.779 --> 01:45:52.346
I'm sorry to hear
about your father.

01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:02.965
Do you remember how angry
I got once when you called him?

01:46:03.008 --> 01:46:04.967
Truth is
it really made me laugh.

01:46:05.010 --> 01:46:06.055
Why?

01:46:07.056 --> 01:46:08.797
He was such a...

01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:10.407
British liberal.

01:46:10.451 --> 01:46:13.149
You know, stuffy historian.

01:46:13.192 --> 01:46:16.544
Hated Israel. The idea of it.

01:46:16.587 --> 01:46:18.720
I can just imagine
what his reaction was like.

01:46:18.763 --> 01:46:20.025
He was pretty scary.

01:46:24.552 --> 01:46:25.944
What do you want, Rachel?

01:46:26.641 --> 01:46:27.946
My name is Ann.

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:32.298
What do you want, Ann?

01:46:35.258 --> 01:46:37.129
Thomas, I called you yesterday

01:46:37.173 --> 01:46:39.436
because I knew
they would pull you into this.

01:46:41.177 --> 01:46:42.439
I'm really glad you're here.

01:46:45.181 --> 01:46:47.096
I went to Switzerland.

01:46:47.139 --> 01:46:48.619
I set up safe deposit boxes

01:46:48.663 --> 01:46:52.188
with information
about "Business as Usual."

01:46:52.231 --> 01:46:54.930
They're paid in advance
for one month only.

01:46:56.932 --> 01:46:59.238
Here's proof
if they need it.

01:46:59.282 --> 01:47:01.023
If they're not paid
by the end of the month...

01:47:03.286 --> 01:47:05.070
The content will be made public.

01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:08.639
I want out, Thomas.

01:47:08.683 --> 01:47:10.467
I don't wanna work
for them anymore.

01:47:10.511 --> 01:47:13.644
I didn't wanna report to them
or do annual polygraphs.

01:47:13.688 --> 01:47:15.907
I'm done.

01:47:15.951 --> 01:47:19.520
And I want you to help me
negotiate Farhad's freedom.

01:47:19.563 --> 01:47:21.696
Extricate him
step-by-step.

01:47:21.739 --> 01:47:23.219
And I'll only follow up
with you.

01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:25.787
Once that's done,

01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:28.006
I'll give you the bank details
and the safe numbers.

01:47:30.095 --> 01:47:31.706
Listen, you know
I have no interest

01:47:31.749 --> 01:47:33.490
in exposing any
of this information.

01:47:33.534 --> 01:47:34.622
Make them understand.

01:47:34.665 --> 01:47:35.971
You're running around Germany,

01:47:36.014 --> 01:47:39.409
assuming that they won't act
on European soil.

01:47:39.453 --> 01:47:40.932
Well, you're wrong.

01:47:40.976 --> 01:47:42.151
They're getting desperate.

01:47:42.194 --> 01:47:43.892
You're an outsider,
you're a foreigner.

01:47:43.935 --> 01:47:45.850
You're not really Israeli
or really Jewish.

01:47:45.894 --> 01:47:47.330
Got no formal tie.

01:47:47.373 --> 01:47:49.114
To them,
you're just a British citizen

01:47:49.158 --> 01:47:50.638
who's suddenly gonna drop dead
in Cologne.

01:47:52.074 --> 01:47:53.379
I haven't so far.

01:47:53.423 --> 01:47:55.469
Then they're waiting for me
to talk you out.

01:48:00.778 --> 01:48:01.997
They won't dare.

01:48:03.259 --> 01:48:04.521
They'll negotiate.

01:48:06.044 --> 01:48:08.612
They'll hit you,
and no one will ever know.

01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:10.745
You'll know.

01:48:18.492 --> 01:48:21.582
Look, Thomas. All my life,
I've done things thinking...

01:48:24.019 --> 01:48:25.411
I just feel like

01:48:25.455 --> 01:48:28.458
I've never really made
a decision that's just mine.

01:48:28.502 --> 01:48:29.590
And this is it.

01:48:29.633 --> 01:48:31.374
This is my decision.

01:48:32.854 --> 01:48:33.985
Even if I'm gonna get shot

01:48:34.029 --> 01:48:35.944
in the next five minutes,

01:48:35.987 --> 01:48:37.249
I still did this.

01:48:54.702 --> 01:48:56.225
Mm-hmm?

01:48:56.268 --> 01:48:57.835
Don't let her leave the table. Make the offer.

01:48:57.879 --> 01:48:59.707
If she walks,
we'll be forced to act.

01:48:59.750 --> 01:49:01.578
Put the phone down.

01:49:01.622 --> 01:49:02.623
-They know the deal.
- Thomas,

01:49:02.666 --> 01:49:04.363
don't let her walk.

01:49:04.407 --> 01:49:05.408
They're here for me.

01:49:27.648 --> 01:49:29.214
Thomas,
what the hell are you doing?

01:49:29.258 --> 01:49:30.825
Get out of the way right now!

01:49:58.679 --> 01:50:00.071
- Run!
