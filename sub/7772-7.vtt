00:12.167 --> 00:14.400
*

00:14.500 --> 00:16.333
- Billie.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.833
Billie.

00:17.933 --> 00:19.233
Hello, my sweet.

00:19.333 --> 00:21.567
- Oh, my God.
Chet?

00:21.667 --> 00:23.000
- The very same.

00:23.100 --> 00:26.333
Am I dreaming right now?

00:26.433 --> 00:27.567
- You tell me.

00:27.667 --> 00:29.400
- Oh, my God.
You're so warm.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.133
- I've had my hands
in my pockets.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.567
- Yes, 'tis I,
the ghost of Chet.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.267
- I've come to see you,
my precious.

00:39.367 --> 00:42.633
- Oh, God, you look so alive.

00:42.733 --> 00:44.733
- Go ahead,
you can touch me.

00:44.833 --> 00:48.000
God, this feels so real.

00:48.100 --> 00:49.300
- It feels so right.

00:49.400 --> 00:50.667
- What are we...
- Shh.

00:50.767 --> 00:52.133
- Okay.

00:52.233 --> 00:54.433
- O.M. gosh.
Stop, I'm gonna throw up.

00:54.533 --> 00:56.233
Way to go, Brett.

00:56.333 --> 00:58.767
This was supposed to be like
a "Scare Tactics" level prank.

00:58.867 --> 01:00.700
Now you're, like, making love
to her--it's embarrassing.

01:02.733 --> 01:04.733
- That's not Chet.
That's Chet's brother, Brett.

01:04.833 --> 01:06.167
- Yeah, like Brett Butler,
"Grace under Fire."

01:06.267 --> 01:08.067
ABC Wednesday nights,
9:30/8:30 Central.

01:08.167 --> 01:09.567
- They're twins.

01:09.667 --> 01:11.700
- Identical.
Except I don't have a lisp.

01:11.800 --> 01:12.767
- But...

01:12.867 --> 01:14.100
- I mean, I don't have one.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.867
- * We're too gangsta for TV

01:15.967 --> 01:17.533
* That's why
you don't see us *

01:17.633 --> 01:19.100
* But they still
wanna be us *

01:19.200 --> 01:21.867
Ha ha!

01:21.967 --> 01:23.767
- Yeah, I'm in town
for a couple days.

01:23.867 --> 01:25.467
Thinking about investing
in a rock company.

01:25.567 --> 01:27.133
- I like rock music.
- No, it's just rocks.

01:27.233 --> 01:28.933
- Well, that's cool
that you're stopping by.

01:29.067 --> 01:30.233
- Yeah.
- Any brother of Chet's

01:30.333 --> 01:31.367
is a new Chet to me,
you know?

01:31.467 --> 01:33.100
New Chet Brett.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.900
Welcome to CLANGENE.

01:35.067 --> 01:36.200
- You know, I'm pretty stoked
that you're into "Halo."

01:36.300 --> 01:38.200
You must be a beast, sister.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.533
- I've killed a few stay-at-home
dads in my day.

01:40.633 --> 01:42.533
There's this one guy--
oh, he's a total dickbutt.

01:42.633 --> 01:44.467
He spams me every time
I get a great weapon.

01:46.700 --> 01:47.800
- Dang it, Kerry!
Get out of here!

01:49.367 --> 01:50.600
Is he ready to watch me
pwn your ass?

01:50.700 --> 01:52.300
- I'm Brett,
like Brett Butler but--

01:52.400 --> 01:54.067
- Pwn your own butt, Kerry!

01:54.167 --> 01:56.267
- The point of the game
is to kill.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.933
Maybe you need to get
your video game GED too.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.867
- Well, guess what, Kerry.

02:01.967 --> 02:03.500
I'm about to take you
to school.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.067
The school of--

02:05.100 --> 02:06.067
No!

02:06.133 --> 02:07.267
What did you do?

02:07.367 --> 02:08.467
- It's time for class.

02:08.567 --> 02:10.500
- That is the meanest thing

02:10.600 --> 02:12.067
that has ever happened

02:12.167 --> 02:14.100
in the history of meanest things
ever to happen.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.100
- I think the Potato Famine
of '45

02:16.200 --> 02:17.600
and bird flu
would disagree with that.

02:17.700 --> 02:19.367
- That sounds
totally made up.

02:19.467 --> 02:21.333
- Those are real things that you
would know if you went to class.

02:23.133 --> 02:25.767
I don't care about
stupid potatoes and sick birds!

02:25.867 --> 02:27.100
If I have to do
all this high school stuff,

02:27.200 --> 02:28.733
I should get to do
the fun stuff too.

02:28.833 --> 02:30.933
- We just did Macbeth
with British accents.

02:31.067 --> 02:34.600
"Is this
a dagger I see before me?"

02:34.700 --> 02:36.433
- I'm talking
about the fun high school stuff,

02:36.533 --> 02:40.100
like...prom or...

02:40.200 --> 02:43.167
Oh, my God.

02:43.267 --> 02:45.433
Oh, my God, you're a genius.
I want to do the prom stuff.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.367
- I didn't say--
- Yes! I love that suggestion.

02:47.467 --> 02:48.600
Prom!
- No, I didn't give that--

02:48.700 --> 02:49.667
- I should totally have a prom.
- Yeah.

02:49.767 --> 02:51.333
- You're the only student.

02:51.433 --> 02:53.267
- I'll ask other GED students.

02:53.367 --> 02:55.833
It's already happening.
Brett, are you there?

02:55.933 --> 02:58.333
- I'm in.

02:58.433 --> 03:02.300
Gene, I didn't go to my prom,
and I turned out...

03:02.400 --> 03:05.500
I think
a prom would do you good.

03:05.600 --> 03:09.733
Okay? Maybe you get
a little over

03:09.833 --> 03:12.533
- Or under the dress.
Excuse me?

03:12.633 --> 03:14.067
- I'm not the one
who almost sucked face

03:14.100 --> 03:15.233
with a ghost last night.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.467
You don't need a prom.

03:18.567 --> 03:19.867
- I'll play you for it.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.400
- You want to play "Halo"
against me?

03:21.500 --> 03:24.500
- Yeah.
- I'm sort of a pro.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.700
- Damn, Gina,
you are good at this.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.167
- Yeah, I've got hands
on a rocket launcher.

03:28.267 --> 03:29.567
Good job, Billie.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.733
- Yeah, I won a tournament
two years ago.

03:30.833 --> 03:32.367
Best New Year's Eve ever!

03:32.467 --> 03:33.800
- Look alive.
Kerry just logged on.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.233
- Why don't you fart-breathers

03:35.333 --> 03:37.167
do yourselves a favor
and log off?

03:37.267 --> 03:39.467
- Because CLANGENE breathes
farts wherever we want!

03:39.567 --> 03:42.367
- I'm tea-bagging your friend.
She likes it!

03:42.467 --> 03:44.367
I don't see the tea bags.

03:44.467 --> 03:45.500
- Billie.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.533
- He killed me.
- No!

03:46.633 --> 03:48.067
Not again!
My rocket launcher!

03:48.167 --> 03:49.467
- Is mine.

03:51.833 --> 03:53.233
My rocket launcher.

03:53.333 --> 03:54.733
- Gene, relax,
it's just a game.

03:55.833 --> 03:57.233
A game

03:57.333 --> 03:59.833
Do you remember
what killed Chet?

04:00.067 --> 04:02.067
A game, Billie, a game.

04:02.167 --> 04:03.600
- We can play again
in a couple minutes.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.533
He already has all my weapons.

04:05.633 --> 04:07.067
What else does he want?

04:07.167 --> 04:08.733
My soul

04:08.833 --> 04:10.467
My brain and also my mouth?

04:10.567 --> 04:11.800
No.

04:11.900 --> 04:14.267
Something has to be
done about this.

04:14.367 --> 04:15.600
- Gene, why are you talking
like that?

04:15.700 --> 04:16.933
- Yeah, stop petting your hands.

04:17.067 --> 04:21.100
- And I know
exactly what to do.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.700
First step--

04:23.800 --> 04:25.300
- Oh, man, poor Gene.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.633
- I know.
I'm worried about her.

04:28.733 --> 04:30.433
No.

04:30.533 --> 04:32.967
- Okay, and hopefully
he's wearing a purple T-shirt.

04:33.067 --> 04:34.367
Get him on the stage.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.267
My revenge plot.
My prom plan. Nothing.

04:37.367 --> 04:39.133
- "First step:
Invite Kerry to prom."

04:39.233 --> 04:40.433
Kerry the "Halo" bully?

04:40.533 --> 04:42.067
Why would you invite him
to a prom?

04:42.133 --> 04:43.667
Which you're not having.

04:43.767 --> 04:45.433
- Because, step two,
when he arrives,

04:45.533 --> 04:46.600
we treat him like a prince.

04:46.700 --> 04:49.067
Or better yet, a king.

04:49.133 --> 04:50.933
A prom king, Billie.

04:51.067 --> 04:54.067
Then, when he least expects it,
step three.

04:54.133 --> 04:55.633
And you know what step three is?

04:55.733 --> 04:56.667
- I honestly have no idea.

04:56.767 --> 04:59.133
- Yeah, you do.

04:59.233 --> 05:00.733
You don't know what it is?
- Uh-uh.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.600
- We dump a bucket
of pig's blood on his head,

05:02.700 --> 05:05.500
just like in that movie
"Carrie."

05:05.600 --> 05:07.567
- Okay, it sounded crazy
either way you said it

05:07.667 --> 05:11.067
'cause your plan is basically
to invite your online nemesis,

05:11.167 --> 05:13.267
who you've never met before...
- Mm-hmm.

05:13.367 --> 05:15.500
- To a fake prom...
- Right.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.167
- Dump a bucket of animal blood
on his head

05:18.267 --> 05:20.633
just because his name
sounds like the name

05:20.733 --> 05:24.600
of a fictional horror movie
character/book character

05:24.700 --> 05:26.167
that that happens to.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.900
Now that I'm hearing it
out loud,

05:30.067 --> 05:31.600
yes, perfect plan!

05:31.700 --> 05:32.967
Ha ha!

05:33.067 --> 05:34.500
- Okay.
You're not having a prom.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.300
Is that permanent marker?

05:37.400 --> 05:39.367
No.

05:41.733 --> 05:43.067
Whiteboard's broken.

05:43.100 --> 05:45.833
*

05:45.933 --> 05:50.433
- Why would something so bulky
be up so high?

05:50.533 --> 05:51.900
- Let me help you with that.

05:52.067 --> 05:52.900
- Oh.

05:55.867 --> 05:57.067
There you go.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.400
- Oh, thank you.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.667
I need this to advertise

06:00.767 --> 06:03.467
the flavors
at my frozen yogurt shop.

06:03.567 --> 06:04.833
- Oh.

06:04.933 --> 06:06.400
- Peanut butter,
vanilla, green tea.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.667
I don't--I don't own
a frozen yogurt shop.

06:08.767 --> 06:11.400
I'm Hank.
- Oh.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.700
"Hank" you for this.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.700
Sorry.
I'm--I'm Billie.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.300
- Okay, so you don't own
a fro-yo shop.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.067
- No, I'm--I'm a teacher--
I'm a tutor.

06:21.133 --> 06:22.067
- I'm a tutor too.

06:22.133 --> 06:23.100
- No way.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.900
- Hand on a Bible.
Yeah.

06:25.067 --> 06:27.600
Is it just me, or is everyone
like, "You're a what?"

06:27.700 --> 06:30.067
- Okay, can you get that Bible
back out here?

06:30.133 --> 06:32.267
'Cause if another person asks
me, "Why aren't you a teacher?

06:32.367 --> 06:33.933
Why are you just a tutor?"

06:34.067 --> 06:35.967
I swear to God,
I'm gonna, like...

06:36.067 --> 06:37.433
do something,
I don't--

06:37.533 --> 06:39.900
- Preach!
- Okay.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.867
- They don't understand
that not every mind

06:41.967 --> 06:44.100
thrives on
traditional education.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.767
- Uh-huh.

06:45.867 --> 06:48.633
- You can get an "amen"
and then some.

06:48.733 --> 06:51.433
I mean, my student,
she's like an adult,

06:51.533 --> 06:53.433
but then she's also
like a little kid.

06:53.533 --> 06:55.100
- You're describing Atticus
to a tee.

06:55.200 --> 06:59.200
- She actually wanted me
to throw her a homeschool prom,

06:59.300 --> 07:01.067
which is like, ugh--
- That's a great idea.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.333
- A great idea,
is what I said.

07:03.433 --> 07:05.967
- Well, Atticus would love that.
- Oh.

07:06.067 --> 07:07.867
- And if you need a date,

07:07.967 --> 07:12.067
I am clearly writing down
my phone number.

07:12.167 --> 07:13.333
If you're free.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.567
- Oh, well, I ain't cheap.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.933
Preach!

07:18.067 --> 07:19.600
- Hallelujah.
- Oh, yeah.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.600
Glory be to God!

07:22.700 --> 07:24.533
I'm not religious, by the way.
- Neither am I.

07:24.633 --> 07:26.833
- Okay, good, 'cause, yeah,
we're shouting in the store...

07:26.933 --> 07:28.833
- Yeah, yeah.
- About Jesus.

07:28.933 --> 07:29.867
"Hank" you.

07:34.400 --> 07:37.400
- Okay, so I posted the invite
on my GED chatroom,

07:37.500 --> 07:39.367
Joy's gonna get the streamers,

07:39.467 --> 07:41.533
and I'm thinking no band,
just my voice.

07:41.633 --> 07:44.233
* Hey, hey, hey, hey, prom

07:44.333 --> 07:45.867
- I think we should get a band
for sure.

07:45.967 --> 07:47.300
- That's so rude.
- I mean, your voice is great--

07:47.400 --> 07:49.933
- Hey, Brett. Hey, Gene.
- Shoot. Hide it.

07:50.067 --> 07:51.133
- Oh, Gene.

07:51.233 --> 07:53.200
- Oh. Hey.
What's up

07:53.300 --> 07:56.133
- I was thinking
about that whole prom thing.

07:56.233 --> 07:57.933
Maybe it's not such a bad idea.

07:59.500 --> 08:01.933
- Yeah. I mean,
you've been working...

08:02.067 --> 08:05.533
hard, and yeah,
you deserve it.

08:05.633 --> 08:07.533
- We already started making
a disco ball.

08:07.633 --> 08:09.067
- Brett!

08:09.133 --> 08:10.333
- Well, I'm a little upset
that you broke

08:10.433 --> 08:12.100
most of the mirrors
in the house,

08:12.200 --> 08:15.633
and this is very dangerous,
but points for creativity, so...

08:15.733 --> 08:17.333
- Yes, point!
- Point!

08:17.433 --> 08:18.667
both: Point, point!

08:18.767 --> 08:20.500
- You don't actually
get points--

08:20.600 --> 08:22.767
- This is so great, Billie.
Prom's gonna be next level.

08:22.867 --> 08:25.333
I'm talking, like, "babies left
in the dumpster" level.

08:25.433 --> 08:27.500
- Well, that's really upsetting.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.167
- No, that sucks.
Who thought of that?

08:29.267 --> 08:31.500
- And none of the pig's blood
stuff too, right?

08:31.600 --> 08:33.200
Just--just a prom.

08:33.300 --> 08:34.767
- Yeah. I mean, totally.

08:34.867 --> 08:36.267
Oh, my gosh, that was, like,
first draft ideas.

08:36.367 --> 08:38.067
- Okay.
- Final draft is just like

08:38.100 --> 08:40.867
me wanting to cut loose with
my GED brothers and sisters.

08:40.967 --> 08:43.500
- Oh, yeah, like,
* cut it loose

08:43.600 --> 08:45.233
- Yeah. Cut it--

08:45.333 --> 08:47.200
both: * Cut it loose
- * With my sisters

08:47.300 --> 08:49.433
- Yeah, you just got to
* cut it loose

08:49.533 --> 08:51.733
- Speaking of
* cutting it loose

08:51.833 --> 08:53.533
with my brothers and sisters,

08:53.633 --> 08:55.767
Billie, now that we have prom
on the books and everything,

08:55.867 --> 08:57.367
I'd like to ask you something.

08:57.467 --> 08:58.600
- Okay.

08:58.700 --> 09:01.567
- Will you--

09:01.667 --> 09:03.067
Will you--

09:05.933 --> 09:07.267
Gene, can you get me a Band-Aid
really quick?

09:07.367 --> 09:08.733
- I'll get a Band-Aid.

09:08.833 --> 09:09.967
- I'll get some Band-Aids.
- Will you, um--

09:10.067 --> 09:11.600
- No, no,
your knees are gross.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.300
- No, it's fine.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.600
- Mm-hmm.

09:14.700 --> 09:15.833
- Yeah, maybe a couple slices
of brie

09:15.933 --> 09:18.767
and some light crackers
and grapes,

09:18.867 --> 09:20.900
just your basic
wine country lunch.

09:21.067 --> 09:22.933
- You want me to go to prom
with you?

09:23.067 --> 09:26.100
Okay, I'm holding an L with
my fingers on my forehead--

09:26.200 --> 09:28.400
you can't see it--
but, you know, for "loser."

09:28.500 --> 09:31.067
- Okay, got it. No, I don't
want you to be my date,

09:31.167 --> 09:32.600
but I would like you to come.

09:32.700 --> 09:35.233
Sort of a promotion
from enemy to frenemy.

09:35.333 --> 09:38.667
- You and I,
actually hanging out in real L?

09:38.767 --> 09:40.800
Am I getting
"To Catch a Predator'd"?

09:40.900 --> 09:42.600
Tell him
he's getting Sissy Spacek'd.

09:42.700 --> 09:43.767
- Shh, stop!

09:43.867 --> 09:45.233
Hemming and hawing.

09:45.333 --> 09:46.633
Are you in or you not?

09:46.733 --> 09:47.667
- I'm in.

09:47.767 --> 09:51.167
Shaft-deep in your mom.

09:51.267 --> 09:53.633
But seriously,
what time is your stupid prom?

09:56.167 --> 09:59.067
- Oh, sorry, 8:00.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.500
- * This is the end
of the song that I wrote *

10:01.600 --> 10:03.000
* That is the length of time

10:03.100 --> 10:04.967
* That I should be
brushing my teeth *

10:05.067 --> 10:06.500
Mm-hmm.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.133
* This is the end of the song
that I... *

10:09.233 --> 10:10.167
- Billie!

10:10.267 --> 10:11.767
What are you doing?

10:11.867 --> 10:13.733
- First and foremost,
that teeth brushing song

10:13.833 --> 10:14.933
should be on top
of the pop charts.

10:15.033 --> 10:16.967
On a more pertinent note,

10:17.067 --> 10:19.267
I'm here to finish the query
that was disrupted

10:19.367 --> 10:22.067
by my unfortunately timed
knee accident.

10:22.167 --> 10:24.967
Billie Brown, will you go
to prom with me?

10:25.067 --> 10:26.667
- Get out of my shower!

10:26.767 --> 10:28.300
- No!

10:29.400 --> 10:30.300
- Get out!

10:30.400 --> 10:31.567
Faster.

10:31.667 --> 10:34.767
- I love your body.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.633
- So Billie gets
on the stage, right?

10:36.733 --> 10:38.967
She announces
prom king and queen.

10:39.067 --> 10:41.033
We get Kerry on the X.

10:41.133 --> 10:42.500
I'm gonna do this:

10:42.600 --> 10:44.800
"Drop the blood!"

10:44.900 --> 10:47.033
And that's your cue to drop
the blood, got it?

10:47.133 --> 10:49.700
- Yeah, I agree.
Billie is rude and insensitive.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.467
- Are you not even listening
to me right now?

10:51.567 --> 10:53.400
- No, I don't even know
why I'm going anymore.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.400
- New Chet Brett,
you are my trigger man, okay?

10:55.500 --> 10:57.700
You have the most important job,
so snap out of it.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.400
Prom is not about being sad
and in love.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.100
It's about revenge and shame.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.933
Tonight, my enemy tastes blood.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.800
Tonight, a war begins.

11:11.333 --> 11:12.933
Okay, well, that looks terrible.
- Not good.

11:13.067 --> 11:14.567
- Can't go to prom like that.
- Here.

11:19.700 --> 11:26.933
*

11:27.067 --> 11:28.200
- Come on, everybody!

11:28.300 --> 11:31.267
Get behind me
or in front of me.

11:31.367 --> 11:35.433
It's not a conga line if you are
not behind or in front of me.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.833
No, those people look like
they live under a bridge.

11:46.933 --> 11:48.100
- Looks like your date
didn't show.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.067
- He's coming.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.300
God, I hope his student
isn't too buttoned up.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.933
These people are just so ugh--

11:54.067 --> 11:55.500
Brett, don't touch me!

11:55.600 --> 11:56.700
- It'd be fun
to take a picture later.

11:58.067 --> 11:58.967
Oh.

12:02.133 --> 12:06.200
*

12:06.300 --> 12:09.867
Gene, you're not in slo-mo.
Stop it.

12:09.967 --> 12:11.900
There's no fan
blowing your hair.

12:12.067 --> 12:13.667
A breeze.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.400
- Don't talk like--
You're not in slo-mo.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.833
- Maybe I was.
- You're not.

12:16.933 --> 12:18.100
- Did you ever think I was
for a second?

12:18.200 --> 12:19.833
- No, I didn't.
I said it right away.

12:19.933 --> 12:21.400
Yes!
- All right, he's here.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.267
He's here. Go, go, go, go, go.
Leave, leave, leave.

12:23.367 --> 12:24.900
- Okay, let me just fix
something 'cause there's a mess.

12:25.067 --> 12:26.700
- Just rip your boobs out.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.867
- Don't touch me. Go, go, go.
- Free 'em for prom.

12:27.967 --> 12:30.533
- Please, leave.
Go, go, go, go, go.

12:30.633 --> 12:32.100
Hank!
- Hey.

12:32.200 --> 12:35.400
- And you must be Atticus.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.067
You are a young boy, wow!

12:38.133 --> 12:39.833
- I like to think that I have
an old spirit.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.100
- Okay.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.833
- Uh, yeah.
- Oh, sure.

12:42.933 --> 12:44.633
Come on in.
All right.

12:44.733 --> 12:47.500
- So where is this student
of yours?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.900
- Oh, um, the party
is in the backyard.

12:50.067 --> 12:51.800
- Great.
So should we head back?

12:51.900 --> 12:53.333
- No.
- No.

12:53.433 --> 12:55.300
I mean, why would you say that?

12:55.400 --> 12:58.500
I thought you wanted to have
some fun with kids your age.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.467
I brought your gluten-free
cookies and your inhaler,

13:00.567 --> 13:01.833
so you're all set.

13:01.933 --> 13:04.233
- I don't want to go back there
right now.

13:04.333 --> 13:06.300
- Look, we drove
all the way out here

13:06.400 --> 13:10.500
to this beautiful home that this
beautiful woman invited us to,

13:10.600 --> 13:13.067
so what if she gave us a tour?

13:13.167 --> 13:14.667
- That'd be better--
I mean, good.

13:14.767 --> 13:17.067
That'd be great.

13:17.133 --> 13:18.367
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:18.467 --> 13:20.067
- Okay.
- Yes!

13:20.100 --> 13:22.967
Look at us,
like we're a little family.

13:23.067 --> 13:26.067
I'm just kidding. That's a joke.
Although we could be.

13:26.133 --> 13:30.067
Just--all going up
to our separate bedrooms.

13:30.133 --> 13:32.067
Except for us.
We'd have the same bedroom.

13:34.100 --> 13:37.400
- Whoo!
We're gonna live forever!

13:37.500 --> 13:39.800
Or a few good solid years.

13:39.900 --> 13:41.400
Yeah?

13:41.500 --> 13:43.767
Mm. Boo.

13:43.867 --> 13:46.533
Who requested
lame "fall in love" music?

13:46.633 --> 13:47.933
It's for chumps.

13:48.067 --> 13:48.933
- Gene!

13:50.133 --> 13:53.067
- It's me, dickhole.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.200
It's Kerry.

13:56.467 --> 13:57.800
You're here.

13:57.900 --> 14:00.433
And that is what you look like.

14:03.533 --> 14:05.800
*

14:05.900 --> 14:09.967
- Hey.

14:10.067 --> 14:13.967
- And last but not least,
this is Gene's room.

14:14.067 --> 14:15.833
- Awesome, "Halo"!

14:15.933 --> 14:17.600
- Oh.

14:17.700 --> 14:20.300
- Don't you want to go down
and meet everyone at the party?

14:20.400 --> 14:23.067
Let him play
for a little of bit.

14:23.133 --> 14:24.467
- Yeah, we can just, uh,

14:24.567 --> 14:25.800
"Hank" out on the bed.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.633
Sorry, last one.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.200
- Thanks, Billie.
- No, "Hank" you.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.833
- Okay, that's plenty, really.
- Okay.

14:30.933 --> 14:33.867
- Hey, so, great party.

14:33.967 --> 14:37.533
Everyone seems
real bombed or...

14:37.633 --> 14:38.867
blitzed.

14:38.967 --> 14:41.467
- Yeah, there's alcohol
available here.

14:41.567 --> 14:44.433
- Right.

14:44.533 --> 14:45.467
Cool pizza.

14:45.567 --> 14:48.133
- We got that.
We bought it.

14:48.233 --> 14:49.667
- Chill.
- Yeah.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.267
I'm sorry
I'm so awkward.

14:54.367 --> 14:56.167
- No, I'm sorry
I'm so pretty.

14:56.267 --> 14:58.700
But you are.

15:00.467 --> 15:01.700
Why are you being
so nice to me?

15:01.800 --> 15:03.667
You're, like, so mean to me
in game.

15:03.767 --> 15:06.533
- I know. I'm sorry, I probably
a little too hard on girls...

15:06.633 --> 15:08.233
- Sexist.
- That I like.

15:08.333 --> 15:09.533
- Sexy.

15:12.500 --> 15:15.467
- I mean, he doesn't hang out
one-on-one

15:15.567 --> 15:17.967
with anyone besides me.

15:18.067 --> 15:20.333
In hindsight, this might have
been too much too soon.

15:20.433 --> 15:22.567
- Well, if it makes you
feel better,

15:22.667 --> 15:25.833
I'd rather be up here with you
than down there with those...

15:25.933 --> 15:29.500
teenaged people with their memes
and their hashtags

15:29.600 --> 15:32.067
and Drake--Drakes.

15:32.167 --> 15:35.100
- Well, uh, maybe next time
it can just be us.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.467
Can I get an "amen"?

15:37.567 --> 15:38.733
- Amen.

15:38.833 --> 15:40.667
- Okay.

15:40.767 --> 15:42.067
- You can get a kiss too.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.300
- Okay.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.600
- Oh, wait.
Where's Atticus?

15:45.700 --> 15:47.100
Oh, this is awesome.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.833
He must have gone
down to the party.

15:48.933 --> 15:50.400
We should spy on him.
Come on.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.400
- No! I mean, nah.

15:52.500 --> 15:56.467
Uh, you know what?
We don't want to compromise--

15:56.567 --> 16:00.400
If he sees you,
it could ruin his sociali--

16:00.500 --> 16:03.367
I'll go and spy on him.

16:03.467 --> 16:06.500
You stay up here.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.833
And I will report back
to headquarters,

16:09.933 --> 16:11.967
Mrs. Moneypenny.

16:12.067 --> 16:13.567
- James Bond style.
- Yeah.

16:17.567 --> 16:19.700
- This is actually really fun.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.733
I'm--I'm having a time.

16:21.833 --> 16:23.700
- People usually say, like,
"good" or "great"

16:23.800 --> 16:24.967
in front of the word "time."

16:25.067 --> 16:26.100
- That too.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.200
Could I see you again?

16:28.300 --> 16:30.533
- I'm sorry,
that was probably really abrupt.

16:30.633 --> 16:33.133
Like I said, I'm not too good
at this kind of situ--

16:33.233 --> 16:35.100
- Shh.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.100
That's boob for "yes."

16:37.200 --> 16:38.367
You hear me?

16:38.467 --> 16:39.567
- Loud and clear.

16:39.667 --> 16:42.700
- Squeeze if you can hear me.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.900
Yeah.
I hear you too.

16:51.067 --> 16:53.433
I thought you said you were shy!

16:54.567 --> 16:55.467
- Billie.

16:55.567 --> 16:57.300
off.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.133
- You're drunk.
Don't do that.

17:00.567 --> 17:03.067
This is the prom?
Who are these people?

17:03.133 --> 17:06.700
- O...kay, I think there's been
a little miscommunication.

17:08.267 --> 17:11.167
Did you eat gluten?
Unbelievable!

17:12.300 --> 17:13.533
Oh!

17:13.633 --> 17:17.267
- Oh, you vomited
on her pregnancy.

17:17.367 --> 17:18.667
Don't make out with her
after you vomit.

17:18.767 --> 17:20.733
- Oh, no, stop.
Stop.

17:20.833 --> 17:22.367
- She's pregnant, by the way.

17:22.467 --> 17:24.533
That's not just beer bloat.

17:31.067 --> 17:34.567
A bucket of...confetti.

17:34.667 --> 17:36.233
I think the night is over.

17:38.067 --> 17:39.433
- I thought you were
someone else.

17:39.533 --> 17:41.500
- No, no, no. I'm a tutor.
Fro-yo shop, preach!

17:41.600 --> 17:43.733
- No, I'm not doing
any more church bits with you.

17:43.833 --> 17:46.667
- Would it be
too crazy romantical

17:46.767 --> 17:48.700
if I just kissed you
right now?

17:48.800 --> 17:51.833
- Does this answer
your question?

17:51.933 --> 17:53.400
Oh, you have blood.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.933
Blood?
- Uh-huh.

17:55.067 --> 17:57.233
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
This is really embarrassing.

17:57.333 --> 17:59.067
It happens
when I get too excited.

17:59.100 --> 18:00.433
- No, that's okay.

18:00.533 --> 18:02.267
- Confetti really makes it
a party, no?

18:02.367 --> 18:05.067
- I don't have time
for this conversation right now.

18:05.100 --> 18:06.767
- It's just
a little bit of blood.

18:06.867 --> 18:10.133
Blood, blood.
NCB, abort the mission!

18:10.233 --> 18:11.667
- Not now, Gene.
- Yeah, not ever!

18:14.167 --> 18:15.500
- Hold on.
- No.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.400
- Okay, but--
- Come on, Atty, come on.

18:17.500 --> 18:18.833
- Excuse me, sir.

18:18.933 --> 18:20.333
I think you need
to calm your roll

18:20.433 --> 18:22.067
when speaking to a lady
of such physical beauty.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.400
- Brett, please don't.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.500
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
What, son?

18:25.600 --> 18:27.067
You want some of this?

18:27.100 --> 18:28.900
Let me tell you something,
friend.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.700
I Krav Maga daily.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.833
- I'm confused.
Am I your son or your friend?

18:32.933 --> 18:35.867
- We're out of here!
Come on, Atticus.

18:35.967 --> 18:37.800
Let's get your EpiPen. Come on.
- Doesn't make any sense.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.700
- Later, bitch.

18:39.800 --> 18:44.133
At least I can digest
wheat flour, son.

18:44.233 --> 18:46.867
Well, that's what I get
for listening to Gene,

18:46.967 --> 18:49.633
a backyard full of weirdos
and the guy that I like leaving,

18:49.733 --> 18:51.833
thinking I'm pathetic, which...

18:51.933 --> 18:55.067
I totally am.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.733
- I don't think
you're pathetic.

18:56.833 --> 18:57.900
- Thanks, Brett.

18:58.067 --> 18:59.700
- That guy might though.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.300
- Thanks, Brett.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.900
Okay, well,
I guess that's my cue

19:05.067 --> 19:06.600
that the evening is over,
so...

19:06.700 --> 19:08.433
- Wait, aren't you gonna
announce the king and queen?

19:10.233 --> 19:11.367
- Yes.

19:12.533 --> 19:13.700
- No.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.867
- Cool.

19:18.967 --> 19:22.867
*

19:25.967 --> 19:30.733
*

19:30.833 --> 19:34.133
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Good-bye.

19:36.900 --> 19:39.800
And the winner is
Gene and Kerry.

19:39.900 --> 19:41.067
- Confetti!

19:44.967 --> 19:48.400
- No!

19:55.733 --> 19:58.067
?

19:58.133 --> 20:00.900
What the ?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.700
Is it blood?

20:03.800 --> 20:06.467
It's blood?

20:06.567 --> 20:09.800
My bangs is blood!

20:09.900 --> 20:11.867
My bangs blood!

20:11.967 --> 20:15.133
- I am so, so, so, so sorry.

20:15.233 --> 20:17.100
Brett, what did you do?

20:17.200 --> 20:18.500
Why did you drop the blood?

20:18.600 --> 20:20.833
- No!

20:23.867 --> 20:24.833
Ah.

20:24.933 --> 20:27.000
Why did you have
an extra bucket?

20:27.100 --> 20:29.200
- I got a deal.

20:29.300 --> 20:32.133
- You guys look like
that "Carrie" movie.

20:33.467 --> 20:35.933
- The blood one.

20:36.033 --> 20:38.133
- Throw a plasma grenade
on the ground,

20:38.233 --> 20:39.500
another one in front of it.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.700
Basically you have
a grenade launcher.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.033
- Oh, my gosh, you're so much
better as a frenemy.

20:44.133 --> 20:46.300
- Maybe I could be
your boyfrienemy.

20:47.967 --> 20:49.200
- Hey, Billie,

20:49.300 --> 20:50.967
even though
I poured blood all over you

20:51.067 --> 20:52.933
and I saw you naked
and you probably hate me,

20:53.033 --> 20:55.167
this is the best date
I've ever had.

20:55.267 --> 20:56.167
- Me too.

20:57.367 --> 21:00.067
- If I'm being honest, no.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.567
Oh, my God, is that pig's blood
that I got on your knees?

21:02.667 --> 21:04.333
- Nah, I just got
super duper sweaty,

21:04.433 --> 21:05.700
and my Band-Aids fell off.

21:14.500 --> 21:15.833
- I need a Band-Aid.

21:15.933 --> 21:17.733
- Yeah, maybe some--

21:17.833 --> 21:19.067
Just a light snack or something,
whatever you have.

21:20.433 --> 21:21.833
- Some kind of leftovers.

21:21.933 --> 21:23.067
There's that--some more
of that tuna casserole.

21:23.133 --> 21:24.400
I would love that.
- Oh, okay.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.167
- Maybe a seltzer water
would be nice too.

21:26.267 --> 21:27.067
New York seltzer
if you have it.
