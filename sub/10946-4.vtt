WEBVTT

00:00.310 --> 00:01.568
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.588 --> 00:03.956
I think starbright is
a really good fit for her.

00:03.990 --> 00:06.355
Because it'll give
her a chance to catch up.

00:06.375 --> 00:07.225
Catch up?

00:07.259 --> 00:10.528
Ms. Wadsworth doesn't
think that Katie is ready.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.065
She's beautiful.

00:13.099 --> 00:14.701
She's nearing the end of her pregnancy.

00:14.721 --> 00:16.902
I like you, Ty, you impress me.

00:16.936 --> 00:18.869
Ah, well, you know I already have a job.

00:18.904 --> 00:21.744
Well, with this grant I
can match what Scott pays.

00:21.764 --> 00:23.869
You really gonna do this?

00:23.889 --> 00:25.477
You left me no choice.

00:25.511 --> 00:29.780
I saw the video, Amy.
I saw you kissing Ahmed.

00:29.815 --> 00:31.916
I'm not working for Ahmed anymore.

00:31.950 --> 00:33.384
So come on, let's take it for a spin

00:33.419 --> 00:35.052
before I have to ship it back.

00:37.010 --> 00:38.921
Whooo!

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.331 --> 00:49.833
I'll see you tonight?

00:49.867 --> 00:51.367
Absolutely.

00:56.407 --> 00:58.609
You know,
maybe you could just tell Bob Granger

00:58.643 --> 01:00.810
that you thought you start
work tomorrow not today.

01:01.964 --> 01:05.282
- Right?
- No... I gotta go.

01:05.316 --> 01:07.743
- Okay. We'll see you tonight.
- Okay. See ya.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.285
Bye.

01:45.707 --> 01:48.256
Okay. Go easy!

01:48.722 --> 01:50.993
That's it, Georgie!

01:56.071 --> 01:57.299
Okay. Not bad.

01:57.333 --> 01:59.607
Do you wanna work on your
"backward thunder"?

01:59.627 --> 02:02.382
Yeah sure.

02:21.580 --> 02:23.483
I messed up at the end. Can I go again?

02:23.503 --> 02:25.506
Sorry, Georgie,
you've run out of time.

02:25.526 --> 02:26.970
There's another girl signed up.

02:26.990 --> 02:28.776
But I only had a half hour.

02:28.796 --> 02:30.897
Can I just have ten more minutes? Please?

02:30.932 --> 02:32.498
I'm never gonna get the
practice time I need

02:32.533 --> 02:33.800
to audition for the extreme team.

02:33.835 --> 02:35.702
I can't keep my students waiting.

02:35.737 --> 02:37.637
And you've still got plenty of time

02:37.671 --> 02:40.679
to get ready for that audition.
Don't stress.

02:45.747 --> 02:48.114
Are you finally finished?

02:48.148 --> 02:49.449
What are you doing here?

02:49.483 --> 02:50.983
What do you think?

02:51.017 --> 02:53.486
I'm taking lessons just like you.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.187
Only, Sandra gives me private ones.

02:55.222 --> 02:57.478
She says I'm a natural.

03:02.405 --> 03:05.175
- Hi.
- Hey Tim!

03:05.299 --> 03:07.719
I heard you were pulling out of town.

03:07.739 --> 03:09.802
Yeah.
I got a string of rodeos from longview

03:09.836 --> 03:12.104
right through to Southern Montana. So...

03:12.139 --> 03:14.460
I'll be gone for a few weeks.

03:14.480 --> 03:17.643
Well,
we never got that lunch we talked about.

03:17.677 --> 03:20.466
Well, you never asked so...

03:26.852 --> 03:28.420
This is me asking.

03:31.675 --> 03:33.406
Well, that sounds good.

03:33.426 --> 03:36.027
- Okay.
- Name the date.

03:36.061 --> 03:38.429
- Okay.
- No pressure.

03:40.272 --> 03:41.737
Bye!

03:43.685 --> 03:45.636
Surely the doctor can see her before then?

03:45.671 --> 03:49.230
I mean, four months? That's crazy...

03:49.528 --> 03:53.511
No. I-I appreciate that you
have a waiting list but...

03:53.545 --> 03:56.146
but what if there is a cancellation?

03:56.181 --> 03:59.021
Yes. No, please, please do let me know.

03:59.041 --> 04:00.718
Thank you.

04:00.752 --> 04:03.020
Four month wait. Can you believe that?

04:03.054 --> 04:05.356
You know,
just because some know it all principal

04:05.390 --> 04:08.359
at an overpriced preschool
thinks she's not ready

04:08.393 --> 04:11.028
does not mean there is anything
wrong with our daughter, sweetheart.

04:11.062 --> 04:13.063
Dr. Lauder is the best
special education psychologist

04:13.097 --> 04:14.698
in the field, honey.

04:14.732 --> 04:16.766
I mean, there's no harm in checking, right?

04:16.801 --> 04:19.903
Okay. Yeah, absolutely.
I won't mention it again.

04:19.938 --> 04:21.404
How was your class?

04:21.439 --> 04:22.472
- Wrong question.
- It sucked!

04:22.506 --> 04:24.574
Hey language...

04:24.608 --> 04:26.242
Okay. Well, it did.

04:26.276 --> 04:28.745
And I barely had any time on Chaplin.

04:28.779 --> 04:31.614
And too many people signed up
so there weren't enough horses.

04:31.649 --> 04:35.066
Oh, and guess who's taking
private lessons with Sandra?

04:35.086 --> 04:36.423
Guess!

04:36.443 --> 04:38.498
- I-I don't know.
- Olivia!

04:38.518 --> 04:40.144
Olivia. Great.

04:40.164 --> 04:43.492
Yep. She couldn't stand that
I was doing something she wasn't.

04:43.526 --> 04:45.261
So she just had to signed up.

04:45.295 --> 04:48.197
And that was the only reason she signed up.

04:48.232 --> 04:51.291
Agh. I'm so mad! Hi Katie.

04:51.311 --> 04:52.701
Hi.

04:55.381 --> 04:56.739
Grandpa, it might be the clinic...

04:56.773 --> 04:58.440
Hello.

04:58.475 --> 05:01.407
Hang on, is Amy...?

05:01.427 --> 05:04.559
No. She rode over to Ty's.
She'll be back soon.

05:04.579 --> 05:08.049
No, I'm sorry she's riding
her horse back from Ty's place.

05:08.084 --> 05:10.952
But I'm sure she won't be that long.

05:11.285 --> 05:13.977
Right. Have a good one.

05:15.318 --> 05:16.447
Who was it?

05:16.467 --> 05:18.276
You will never guess.

05:41.162 --> 05:43.366
Hello.

05:44.319 --> 05:47.154
I was hoping I would run into you.

05:47.647 --> 05:49.682
You look beautiful.

05:53.007 --> 05:56.048

06:34.040 --> 06:35.835
What are you doing here?

06:35.869 --> 06:38.270
Why aren't you in Europe
with the rest of your team?

06:38.304 --> 06:40.072
It's a pleasure to see you too.

06:40.106 --> 06:42.174
I'm sorry it's just...

06:42.208 --> 06:44.456
I was compelled to come back.

06:44.476 --> 06:45.678
What else could I do?

06:45.712 --> 06:47.544
You were ignoring all my emails and texts.

06:47.564 --> 06:48.213
Well...

06:48.247 --> 06:49.648
And then the truck.

06:49.683 --> 06:51.949
I don't understand why you
would return the truck.

06:51.969 --> 06:53.552
It was a bonus for all your hard work.

06:53.587 --> 06:56.920
It was too big of a gesture.
I wasn't comfortable with it.

06:56.940 --> 07:00.725
It would have been valuable
when we are back working at Hillhurst.

07:00.759 --> 07:03.169
You wouldn't always be depending
on other peoples' vehicles.

07:03.189 --> 07:06.498
I'm not coming back to work
at Hillhurst. I told you that.

07:06.532 --> 07:08.898
No. You said you weren't
coming back to the tour.

07:08.918 --> 07:10.302
That's not what I said.

07:10.336 --> 07:12.904
Now you're saying you don't want to
be my head trainer here at Hillhurst?

07:12.938 --> 07:14.772
Not possible. Of course you are staying on.

07:14.807 --> 07:18.543
No. I'm not. I thought you understood.

07:18.577 --> 07:21.042
Why would you walk away from
something you excelled at,

07:21.062 --> 07:23.201
that you enjoyed.

07:23.221 --> 07:27.051
Ahmed, you know why...

07:27.804 --> 07:30.174
All right.

07:30.889 --> 07:34.597
I admit the circumstances
were slightly awkward...

07:34.617 --> 07:36.495
before you left France...

07:36.515 --> 07:38.262
You're just tired from the tour.

07:38.296 --> 07:40.631
When you have time to relax, rethink,

07:40.665 --> 07:42.596
you will see things more clearly.

07:42.616 --> 07:43.600
Ahmed...

07:43.635 --> 07:45.435
Can I at least accompany you home?

07:47.303 --> 07:48.787
Sure.

08:05.225 --> 08:07.257
I am freaking out here, man.

08:07.291 --> 08:10.460
Four new animals have been
dropped off since yesterday! Four!

08:10.494 --> 08:12.516
A bear cub that turned
up in someone's garbage.

08:12.536 --> 08:13.930
Two coyote cubs,

08:13.964 --> 08:18.634
and a porcupine that we
gotta check for rabies.

08:18.654 --> 08:20.536
Absolutely. Yeah.

08:20.571 --> 08:23.422
Oh, and hey,
see that feed shipment that just arrived?

08:23.442 --> 08:24.640
Take care of that.

08:24.675 --> 08:26.823
Also the llama fence over there
looks like the side is sagging.

08:26.843 --> 08:27.877
If it is, fix it.

08:27.911 --> 08:29.144
Yeah, I can handle that.

08:29.179 --> 08:30.680
Oh and on top of everything else,

08:30.714 --> 08:34.783
the pregnant wolf is about to pop.
So take a look at her for me?

08:35.693 --> 08:36.964
Will do.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.696
Thanks, bud.

08:39.751 --> 08:41.557
Yes,
but are you sure that's necessary?

08:41.591 --> 08:45.327
Because I'd really like
to see Dr. Lauder not...

08:45.730 --> 08:48.373
I understand. Yes, thank you.

08:48.547 --> 08:50.458
- Hi.
- Oh hi. Dad.

08:50.478 --> 08:54.803
Okay, so apparently she should
see a special education evaluator

08:54.837 --> 08:56.938
if we can't get an
appointment with Dr. Lauder.

08:56.973 --> 08:58.907
- What do you think?
- What?

08:58.941 --> 09:02.243
A special education evaluator.
It's for Katie.

09:02.277 --> 09:05.814
Oh.
Listen, you two, don't stress this.

09:05.848 --> 09:08.124
There is nothing wrong
with my grand daughter.

09:08.144 --> 09:10.718
Thank you, Tim. I couldn't agree more.

09:10.752 --> 09:12.820
That's gotta be a first, general.

09:17.788 --> 09:19.278
Lou.

09:22.045 --> 09:25.431
- Ahmed is back.
- What?!

09:26.134 --> 09:28.873
Now that is a relationship worth nurturing.

09:28.893 --> 09:31.330
Yes, so you've said. Dad.

09:31.350 --> 09:34.264
Dad, come back here! Dad...

09:34.284 --> 09:36.436
Just wait a second.

09:36.456 --> 09:39.246
Ahmed! Good to see you!

09:39.280 --> 09:42.315
Congratulations on a successful tour.

09:42.350 --> 09:45.418
Our success was greatly
due to your daughter's expertise.

09:45.453 --> 09:47.154
Well, I think it calls for a celebration.

09:47.188 --> 09:49.289
Why don't join us for dinner tonight?

09:49.323 --> 09:52.825
What's do you say? Is it okay, Lou?

09:52.860 --> 09:55.669
I would love to,
but I will have to take...

09:55.689 --> 09:57.766
what do you call it? A rain check.

09:57.786 --> 09:59.999
Another evening would be wonderful.

10:00.019 --> 10:01.240
Huh.

10:01.260 --> 10:03.435
I will talk to you soon, Amy.

10:06.204 --> 10:07.631
Ha.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.544
Georgie is that a trick
ridding saddle on Phoenix?

10:16.564 --> 10:17.516
There's no way.

10:17.551 --> 10:20.577
Phoenix is a great horse but
he's not a trick riding horse.

10:20.597 --> 10:24.323
Phoenix can do anything.
Including trick riding.

10:24.357 --> 10:28.485
So, Ahmed is back.
That's just great, isn't it?

10:29.829 --> 10:32.831
Georgie!
You are not trick riding on Phoenix!

10:32.865 --> 10:35.774
Relax.
I'm just getting him used to the saddle!

10:35.794 --> 10:37.335
Lou. Lou.

10:37.369 --> 10:39.573
I don't understand why
you're ticked off with me

10:39.593 --> 10:42.640
- for inviting Ahmed to dinner?
- Because, it's just...

10:42.675 --> 10:44.209
It's-it's what?
It's not very hospitable.

10:44.243 --> 10:46.448
What? I'm not prepared
to invite a prince to dinner

10:46.468 --> 10:47.991
at the last minute, okay?

10:48.011 --> 10:52.721
I don't-I don't think he'd care, okay?
The guy- he's down to earth.

10:52.741 --> 10:55.786
Yeah.
For a guy who owns a private jet.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.855
Let's not forget how kind he
wad to Amy when she was injured.

10:57.889 --> 11:00.921
He was very, very generous.
We should all remember that.

11:00.941 --> 11:03.336
So I don't see what the problem is.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.463
Good boy, Phoenix.

11:06.497 --> 11:08.860
You like this saddle, don't you?

11:10.709 --> 11:12.870
Whoa! Oof!

11:12.904 --> 11:16.540
Georgie! Come on now,
you said you weren't gonna do a trick!

11:16.574 --> 11:19.260
You could have really
hurt yourself or Phoenix!

11:19.280 --> 11:22.379
- Okay! Okay!
- No. It's not okay!

11:22.413 --> 11:25.775
You need to learn to think before
you make these crazy decisions!

11:25.795 --> 11:27.684
You should talk.

11:30.208 --> 11:32.019
You know I'm right.

11:34.117 --> 11:35.491
You have to talk to Sandra!

11:35.525 --> 11:38.494
Maybe she can give me some extra time
on Chaplin after school or something.

11:38.528 --> 11:39.796
You got a lot going
on after school already.

11:39.830 --> 11:41.297
Well, I need to practice time

11:41.331 --> 11:43.432
or else I'm not gonna
make the extreme team.

11:43.467 --> 11:46.236
Please can I have private lessons,
like Olivia?

11:46.270 --> 11:48.766
No. You can't because we
can't afford it, Georgie, okay?

11:48.786 --> 11:50.006
And you have to understand that things

11:50.040 --> 11:52.493
aren't always gonna go the way
you want them to, all right?

11:52.513 --> 11:53.776
Obviously.

11:53.810 --> 11:56.712
Oops!

11:56.968 --> 11:58.784
Can you pick up my plate, please!

11:58.804 --> 12:00.249
Sorry, I'm late, everyone.

12:00.284 --> 12:03.051
Honey, it's a bowl.
Can you say, pick up my bowl?

12:03.086 --> 12:04.754
I just come straight from work,
I didn't have time to change there.

12:04.788 --> 12:06.427
How did it go?

12:06.447 --> 12:08.722
It was great! The place is amazing!

12:08.742 --> 12:10.460
It's a little disorganized.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.850
Nothing we can't whip into shape.

12:12.870 --> 12:16.171
- I got to baby-sit a bear cub today.
- Oh, that's what I'm smelling.

12:16.191 --> 12:17.499
How is the wolf?

12:17.519 --> 12:19.224
She's about ready to have her babies.

12:19.244 --> 12:22.537
Yeah-oh,
I forgot to look at the llama fence today!

12:22.557 --> 12:24.790
What?
Shoot! I have to do that tomorrow.

12:24.810 --> 12:25.873
They have lamas?

12:25.908 --> 12:29.033
- Yeah. They do.
- I love lamas. They spit!

12:30.179 --> 12:32.204
So Amy, honey, what's your plan?

12:32.224 --> 12:33.715
What do you mean my plan?

12:33.749 --> 12:36.832
Well, Ahmed is back.
So what-what's your plan?

12:36.852 --> 12:39.102
Are you gonna head up to Hillhurst?

12:39.967 --> 12:41.856
Ahmed is back in town?
I thought he was in Europe with his team.

12:41.890 --> 12:44.072
Does anyone want seconds on the salad?

12:44.092 --> 12:44.892
I'm okay.

12:44.927 --> 12:46.566
I tell you,
the guy - he is so friendly, huh?

12:46.586 --> 12:49.297
- Wasn't he this afternoon?
- Oh, you saw him today?

12:49.331 --> 12:51.925
Uh, yeah, I ran into him
on the way back from your place.

12:51.945 --> 12:55.891
You know what? I made pie.
Who's up for coffee and pie?

13:02.577 --> 13:06.680
So Ahmed... What was that about?

13:08.465 --> 13:10.339
Take a guess.

13:10.587 --> 13:13.452
He came all the way back here
to try and talk you out of your decision?

13:13.923 --> 13:16.823
Yeah. But I set him straight.

13:17.336 --> 13:21.027
That's my girl. Stick to your guns.

13:21.744 --> 13:24.859
I'll call you tomorrow.
I gotta work late so I might miss dinner.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.733
Okay.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.813
Come in.

13:46.935 --> 13:48.735
Ahmed. Welcome back!

13:48.755 --> 13:49.855
Hello. Thank you.

13:49.889 --> 13:52.023
Look who's here.

13:52.057 --> 13:54.693
Hello. I'm on my way to an
auction in Black Diamond.

13:54.727 --> 13:55.861
I would love you to come with me.

13:55.895 --> 13:59.230
Look over the horses I'm interested in.
Give me advice.

13:59.265 --> 14:01.299
Amy's got a great eye that's for sure.

14:01.333 --> 14:03.435
Ah, it's just you know, I can't.

14:03.469 --> 14:04.936
I have chores pilling up.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.837
Oh, I'll do your work for you.

14:06.872 --> 14:09.207
You should go. Catch up on the tour news.

14:09.241 --> 14:10.909
It's just-it's a little short-notice...

14:10.943 --> 14:12.535
You know, I'm not ready.

14:12.555 --> 14:14.245
Take your time.

14:15.012 --> 14:15.914
Okay.

14:15.948 --> 14:18.883
Uh, yeah. I'll just need a few minutes.

14:18.918 --> 14:21.068
Ahmed, would you mind if Ty came?

14:21.316 --> 14:22.686
Not at all.

14:22.721 --> 14:25.589
- He's just really good at auctions.
- Yeah.

14:25.624 --> 14:26.990
I'll wait for you outside.

14:27.025 --> 14:28.759
- Okay.
- Nice to see you, Mr. Bartlett.

14:28.794 --> 14:31.924
- You too. Have fun.
- Thank you.

14:36.768 --> 14:40.237
There's one animal in particular
that is interesting to me.

14:40.271 --> 14:43.006
A belgian warmblood. Incredible lineage.

14:43.041 --> 14:44.841
I look forward to your opinion.

14:44.875 --> 14:47.210
Yeah, of course.

14:47.245 --> 14:49.213
So...
did I tell you about the new business

14:49.233 --> 14:50.948
that Ty has started?

14:50.982 --> 14:54.016
He and a partner are buying
rodeo prospect horses.

14:54.051 --> 14:56.419
and training them.
They're actually really good at it.

14:56.454 --> 14:59.422
I've been helping train some of the horses.

15:01.749 --> 15:03.735
Excuse me.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.829
Hello, Ty.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.130
I can't meet you. Bob just called.

15:08.165 --> 15:09.899
He's got called out on
an emergency pick up.

15:09.934 --> 15:12.068
So I need to go into work right now.

15:12.518 --> 15:14.103
I'm sorry.

15:14.137 --> 15:16.205
But you can deal with him though, right?

15:16.239 --> 15:18.874
Yeah. Of course. Absolutely.

15:18.908 --> 15:22.411
- I love you.
- Okay. Love you.

15:22.446 --> 15:24.313
Everything all right?

15:24.348 --> 15:27.919
Yeah, um, Ty just can't come.
He got called into work.

15:37.920 --> 15:41.521
All I remember is it was crazy back than.

15:41.541 --> 15:44.276
Well, you were crazy.

15:44.311 --> 15:47.769
You had partied and rodeoed
and then partied some more.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.356
Thanks for this, by the way.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.619
This is so much better than a restaurant.

15:53.653 --> 15:54.853
From a restaurant.

15:57.380 --> 15:59.837
So that year...

15:59.857 --> 16:04.465
You just won your 3rd consecutive
all round cowboy trophy, right?

16:04.850 --> 16:09.067
Oh. Your 4th? Who's counting?

16:09.101 --> 16:12.137
Do you remember that big
dance after stampede?

16:12.171 --> 16:14.906
And nobody went home
until noon the next day.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.641
Yeah, yeah.

16:16.675 --> 16:19.177
I don't remember that.

16:21.780 --> 16:24.982
You know what I remember? And what I miss?

16:25.017 --> 16:27.952
It's the atmosphere.

16:27.986 --> 16:30.220
You know, once that gets in your blood...

16:32.323 --> 16:34.025
Well, if you really do miss it,

16:34.059 --> 16:36.794
maybe you should come
with me on my rodeo tour.

16:38.507 --> 16:42.232
That atmosphere still exists.
There's nothing like it.

16:42.557 --> 16:44.580
I don't know.

16:46.571 --> 16:48.939
There was a cancellation?

16:48.973 --> 16:53.143
Fantastic. No. Absolutely, we can make it.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.094
- Thank you for letting me know.
- Here we go.

16:55.114 --> 16:56.713
Dr. Lauder's office,
there is a cancellation.

16:56.747 --> 16:58.214
I gathered that.

16:58.248 --> 17:00.584
They can see Katie in an hour.

17:00.618 --> 17:03.519
Honey, he is so hard to get into.
You know he has a huge-

17:03.554 --> 17:05.088
Waiting list. Yeah,
I know you told me.

17:05.122 --> 17:07.961
Um, I guess that's why he's the best.

17:07.981 --> 17:11.727
I'm just saying,
he can give us a reliable opinion on Katie.

17:11.761 --> 17:13.380
I don't see why you're fighting me on this?

17:13.400 --> 17:15.263
He's a really good doctor.

17:15.299 --> 17:18.834
- No doctor!
- Katie? Katie!

17:18.867 --> 17:20.883
Honey...

17:25.476 --> 17:28.202
Oh great. They're out!

17:30.622 --> 17:32.346
C'mon, guys!

17:35.374 --> 17:37.384
Go this way!

17:37.404 --> 17:39.792
No. No. No. No!

17:41.224 --> 17:43.391
Here we go! Here we go!

17:43.426 --> 17:45.727
Come on!

17:45.761 --> 17:48.530
Come on! Come on!

17:49.126 --> 17:50.826
Come on!

17:53.035 --> 17:54.669
It's okay.

17:54.703 --> 17:57.798
Oh! What was that?!

18:00.243 --> 18:01.844
Aghhh!

18:07.315 --> 18:10.051
Oh! Oh! You missed your turn.
The auction is that way.

18:10.085 --> 18:12.020
We're going to make a small detour.

18:12.054 --> 18:14.656
I have something else
I need your advice on.

18:19.093 --> 18:20.994
Come on, Katie,
we really have to go now.

18:21.029 --> 18:23.597
No, mamma.

18:23.632 --> 18:27.168
Okay.
Honey, it's gonna be really, really fun.

18:27.202 --> 18:28.969
You can colour pictures and play with toys.

18:29.003 --> 18:30.837
No needles.

18:30.872 --> 18:33.199
No needles. I promise.

18:33.219 --> 18:34.741
Look.

18:34.776 --> 18:36.543
You can bring Mookie if you want.

18:36.577 --> 18:38.823
Do you wanna bring Mookie?

18:39.022 --> 18:41.314
Katie please.

18:49.523 --> 18:52.258
Nice work!
All right, Georgie, you're up.

18:52.293 --> 18:54.294
All right.

19:12.145 --> 19:14.947
That was great!
You're doing really well.

19:14.981 --> 19:16.682
Now with just a little bit more practice...

19:16.717 --> 19:19.085
That's the problem. I can't practice.

19:19.119 --> 19:22.104
It's not that I don't have the time.
It's that I don't have a horse.

19:22.124 --> 19:24.089
Chaplin isn't available very often.

19:24.123 --> 19:27.158
I know. But what can I say?
He's a popular horse, Georgie.

19:27.193 --> 19:30.829
All the girls want their lessons on him.

19:30.863 --> 19:32.864
Nice, huh?

19:32.898 --> 19:35.300
My dad just got him for me yesterday.

19:35.335 --> 19:39.036
His name is winner and that's
just what I intend on doing.

20:09.213 --> 20:11.902
Wow. Is this a hotel?

20:11.936 --> 20:14.704
No. No. A private residence.

20:15.540 --> 20:16.907
What do you think?

20:16.941 --> 20:19.943
It's amazing... It's huge...

20:19.978 --> 20:22.813
Not really.
Just over 13,000 square feet.

20:23.411 --> 20:25.282
I'm thinking of buying it.

20:25.316 --> 20:28.018
I'd be glad to get your
honest opinion about it.

20:28.052 --> 20:29.686
You know I value it on everything...

20:29.720 --> 20:32.691
not just auction horses. Hmm?

20:34.590 --> 20:36.654
Come. I want to show you around.

20:36.674 --> 20:39.504
- It's quite impressive.
- Yeah.

20:43.801 --> 20:47.400
147 acres. Totally private.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.135
Took them years to landscape it.

20:50.155 --> 20:52.341
Everything had to be brought in.

20:52.375 --> 20:55.800
Apparently in the summer this
is a massive rose garden.

20:55.820 --> 20:57.947
The best in Alberta I'm told.

20:57.981 --> 21:01.086
And the views are spectacular.
Don't you think?

21:01.106 --> 21:02.718
It's beautiful.

21:02.752 --> 21:05.187
I've really never seen anything like it.

21:05.487 --> 21:07.808
Your house in France is incredible.

21:07.828 --> 21:09.224
It is.

21:09.258 --> 21:11.760
But I feel the need to put
down some roots here as well.

21:11.795 --> 21:14.830
And I'll show you the inside too.
And the stables.

21:14.864 --> 21:17.098
I think you will love the stables.

21:20.102 --> 21:23.538
I'm happy to see you're
wearing my necklace.

21:23.971 --> 21:26.407
Well, this is from the team.

21:26.442 --> 21:30.883
No, it was from me.
I bought it alone for you.

21:33.067 --> 21:34.882
You see, Amy.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.678
I want to give you things.

21:37.698 --> 21:41.282
I've never wanted to give anything
to any other person in my life.

21:41.302 --> 21:45.220
- Ahmed, please...
- No. Hear me out.

21:45.627 --> 21:50.965
I'm a man who has been accused of being...
unfeeling.

21:51.784 --> 21:53.167
I'm not proud of it.

21:53.201 --> 21:55.702
It was simply the way I was raised.

21:55.737 --> 21:58.906
Emotion doesn't come easily to me.

21:59.344 --> 22:02.496
But I know it now. How it feels.

22:02.769 --> 22:04.044
And I must tell you

22:04.079 --> 22:05.579
because I'm not sure I will
ever feel this way again.

22:05.613 --> 22:07.147
- Ahmed...
- No.

22:07.182 --> 22:10.524
It has to be said. You have to know.

22:11.629 --> 22:13.589
I'm in love with you.

22:20.865 --> 22:21.962
You see, Amy...

22:21.982 --> 22:25.151
I've been feeling this way for a very,
very long time.

22:25.171 --> 22:27.362
Amy, please, listen to me.

22:27.382 --> 22:29.559
You are the only woman ever in my life

22:29.579 --> 22:32.212
that I can be completely myself with.

22:32.247 --> 22:35.483
The only woman that will tell
me the truth about myself.

22:35.517 --> 22:38.085
The only woman I have ever had feelings for

22:38.119 --> 22:41.855
in such a strong undeniable way.

22:42.427 --> 22:44.325
Ahmed, I'm flattered.

22:44.359 --> 22:50.176
I really am, but this can't happen, okay?

22:51.033 --> 22:53.408
We can be friends, but-but that's it.

22:53.428 --> 22:55.535
I'm engaged. I'm in love with Ty.

22:55.570 --> 22:57.590
- Are you?
- Yes!

22:57.610 --> 22:58.972
Then why did you kiss me?

22:59.006 --> 23:01.549
I-I didn't kiss you. You kissed me.

23:01.569 --> 23:03.376
You gave me every reason to.

23:03.410 --> 23:05.979
I don't make a habit of
kissing random girls.

23:06.013 --> 23:09.215
If I gave you that impression,
I am sorry.

23:09.249 --> 23:12.318
But I thought I made it
perfectly clear that night how I felt.

23:12.353 --> 23:16.258
That we are friends and team mates,
and nothing more.

23:17.263 --> 23:19.225
You know, Ahmed,

23:19.259 --> 23:22.261
I really enjoyed and
valued our relationship,

23:22.296 --> 23:28.166
but given the circumstances,
we need to end this.

23:29.158 --> 23:33.856
Look, I think it's fair to
either of us to continue.

23:34.874 --> 23:36.797
I need some distance.

23:37.939 --> 23:39.645
Some distance.

23:39.679 --> 23:43.463
All right. Of course.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.650
I understand.

23:45.670 --> 23:48.536
- Do you?
- Yes.

23:48.958 --> 23:50.708
I will drive you home.

23:57.163 --> 24:00.532
Whoa, whoa, easy girl. Easy.

24:00.566 --> 24:02.480
I'm not gonna hurt you.

24:04.515 --> 24:07.647
She's fighting me a bit.
That's a good sign.

24:07.667 --> 24:10.441
She's got her strength back.
She's hydrated.

24:10.475 --> 24:12.476
And she's looking a lot better
than when I first saw her.

24:12.511 --> 24:16.131
I know. Well, that's why I hired you.

24:17.521 --> 24:18.782
Hey... good girl.

24:24.622 --> 24:27.391
So you were pretty
quiet the whole way home.

24:27.426 --> 24:30.094
What did you think?

24:30.128 --> 24:32.637
Uh, that it was a
complete waste of time and energy

24:32.657 --> 24:35.165
to be honest with you.

24:35.199 --> 24:38.418
We did it, right?
So... Good. Find out soon.

24:41.773 --> 24:44.989
Okay? Hey honey...

24:52.183 --> 24:55.452
I want you to know
I meant every word I said.

24:55.486 --> 24:57.420
Perhaps you should take some time to think.

24:57.455 --> 24:59.989
I am sorry,
but there's nothing for me to think about.

25:00.023 --> 25:01.691
Amy,
I think you have to open your mind

25:01.725 --> 25:03.590
to life's possibilities.

25:03.610 --> 25:05.359
I know what I want in life.

25:05.379 --> 25:09.031
And I already have it. Goodbye Ahmed.

25:16.740 --> 25:19.104
He said that?
He actually said that he loved you?

25:19.124 --> 25:21.110
- Yes. He did!
- Oh Amy...

25:21.144 --> 25:23.312
Lou, I know I never gave him any signs

25:23.346 --> 25:26.315
that we were more than just co-workers,
or friends...

25:26.349 --> 25:28.797
I don't think I did
anything to lead him on.

25:28.817 --> 25:31.850
And I've asked myself
that over and over again.

25:31.870 --> 25:34.940
Look, we were friends, okay? Just friends.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.406
And I told him that the night of the party.

25:37.426 --> 25:38.727
And I didn't think he listen to me.

25:38.761 --> 25:40.995
I don't think he listened to me today!

25:41.029 --> 25:43.397
I don't know what to do, okay?
I have no idea.

25:43.432 --> 25:45.399
And... do I tell Ty?

25:45.434 --> 25:47.668
No! Do not tell Ty, okay?

25:47.702 --> 25:49.203
You've tried that in the
past and it didn't work out.

25:49.238 --> 25:50.971
I know, but Lou...

25:51.006 --> 25:52.906
Amy, just deal with this Ahmed situation

25:52.941 --> 25:56.477
as swiftly and smoothly
as you can on your own.

25:56.512 --> 25:58.946
Be firm with him and he will go away.

25:58.980 --> 26:01.174
And then everything will go back to normal.

26:01.194 --> 26:02.916
I want that.

26:02.951 --> 26:04.752
I just don't wanna hurt Ty.
You know, I love him so much.

26:04.786 --> 26:07.582
And I don't want...

26:07.602 --> 26:11.125
You know Ahmed is just used
to getting exactly what he wants.

26:11.159 --> 26:13.439
Don't worry, okay?

26:14.295 --> 26:15.562
It's all my fault.

26:15.596 --> 26:17.864
No! Georgie!

26:22.690 --> 26:25.284
What's that all about?

26:25.304 --> 26:28.477
Pour me a glass of wine
and I'll tell you all about it.

26:34.148 --> 26:37.635
Georgie. Hey...

26:38.085 --> 26:40.753
There's no reason to cry.
It's not your fault.

26:40.788 --> 26:43.790
- Yes it is.
- How?

26:43.824 --> 26:46.858
Because I was the one who found the video.

26:47.259 --> 26:48.794
You did?

26:48.828 --> 26:49.995
Yes, I followed your tour online.

26:50.029 --> 26:52.515
And it was on some stupid blog.

26:52.535 --> 26:54.533
But I thought Lou...

26:54.568 --> 26:57.403
I'm the one who showed her...

26:57.971 --> 27:03.151
And I should have kept it to myself!
I am so sorry.

27:03.171 --> 27:05.643
No. You have no reason to apologize.

27:05.678 --> 27:07.813
But I blamed you for
what happened at that party.

27:07.847 --> 27:10.916
It was all that stupid Ahmed's fault.

27:10.950 --> 27:14.168
I am so sorry. Will you ever forgive me?

27:14.188 --> 27:16.489
Of course. It's okay.

27:24.997 --> 27:27.765
So how did the appointment go?

27:27.799 --> 27:30.401
The doctor said he would let us know.

27:30.721 --> 27:33.438
He seemed pretty noncommittal.

27:33.472 --> 27:37.472
Hmm. See, it's my opinion that

27:37.709 --> 27:39.543
you know, people they look at this stuff

27:39.577 --> 27:41.879
and get all wrought up about it

27:41.913 --> 27:44.175
before they even know if there
is anything really wrong.

27:44.195 --> 27:47.852
- Okay, grandpa...
- I have a sore knee today, Lou.

27:47.886 --> 27:51.789
And I bet if I looked up
"sore knee" on the Internet

27:51.823 --> 27:54.358
I'd find a bunch of articles and opinions

27:54.392 --> 27:56.326
that end up making me think I have to have

27:56.361 --> 27:59.296
my whole damn leg cut off at the hip.

27:59.330 --> 28:02.165
I'm just arming myself, okay? In case...

28:02.199 --> 28:05.288
You're scaring yourself, Lou.

28:05.637 --> 28:08.605
If there's a problem,
which I very much doubt,

28:08.640 --> 28:10.953
you and Peter, you'll work it out.

28:10.973 --> 28:13.476
We all will.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.520
A word to the wise...

28:17.681 --> 28:20.716
take that Internet stuff
with the grain of salt.

28:20.751 --> 28:24.567
It betrays as much as it enlightens.

28:27.824 --> 28:30.025
Were there any messages on the home line?

28:30.059 --> 28:33.236
Just one. From guess who? Olivia.

28:33.256 --> 28:34.963
What did she want?

28:34.998 --> 28:38.334
I don't know,
I didn't call her back.

28:38.368 --> 28:40.136
But did I tell you that
her parents bought her

28:40.156 --> 28:42.304
her very own trick riding horse?

28:42.338 --> 28:45.390
Really? Well,
that will free up some time on Chaplin.

28:45.410 --> 28:47.075
Not really.

28:47.110 --> 28:50.913
I mean, there's a line up of
kids waiting to ride Chaplin.

28:50.947 --> 28:52.881
So, she's got her own trick riding horse

28:52.916 --> 28:54.770
when I don't even have a
trick horse to practice on.

28:54.790 --> 28:56.086
Honey...

28:56.106 --> 28:57.552
- Hey there!
- Hey...

28:57.586 --> 28:59.593
Our mamma wolf is about
to give birth tonight.

28:59.613 --> 29:02.223
- So I might have to take off early.
- Oh, okay.

29:02.257 --> 29:03.891
- This looks good.
- Uh...

29:03.926 --> 29:06.687
Hey, you don't happen to
know a trick riding horse

29:06.707 --> 29:08.162
that's orphaned, do you?

29:08.197 --> 29:10.498
Hmm. I don't know. Maybe.

29:10.533 --> 29:12.066
I'll give Caleb a call.
See what's he's got on the go.

29:12.100 --> 29:14.803
Really? That'd be awesome!

29:14.837 --> 29:18.065
Hey, look who's coming to dinner!

29:26.179 --> 29:29.413
Well, now that you have all
that experience from the tour, Amy

29:29.433 --> 29:32.303
I think you can name your price
when it comes to training,

29:32.323 --> 29:34.884
but you owe a lot of thanks to Ahmed here.

29:34.904 --> 29:37.043
He's the one who took the leap of faith.

29:37.063 --> 29:38.807
It wasn't a leap of faith.

29:38.841 --> 29:41.110
I was quite confident
that Amy had the knowledge

29:41.144 --> 29:45.208
and the personality to excel
at being a head trainer.

29:45.556 --> 29:47.782
And I was proven right.

29:47.817 --> 29:50.685
I do hope that it increases
the quality of your clientele,

29:50.720 --> 29:52.386
I also hope it will not
interfere with the time

29:52.421 --> 29:54.161
you allow me at Hillhurst.

29:54.181 --> 29:56.891
Ahmed, I told you,
that's not really part of my plan.

29:56.926 --> 29:58.359
I think Amy made it very clear,

29:58.393 --> 30:00.361
she isn't working for you anymore.

30:00.395 --> 30:01.596
She works with horses that really need her.

30:01.631 --> 30:03.598
Not the high end animals you deal with.

30:03.633 --> 30:05.466
She's getting back to her roots.

30:05.501 --> 30:07.034
Back to her roots...

30:07.068 --> 30:09.670
that's not the best plan
for a profitable career.

30:09.704 --> 30:11.521
- Well, I think that's Amy's business.
- Okay Ty.

30:11.541 --> 30:12.906
Well,
I think that you should be encouraging her

30:12.941 --> 30:14.849
to move forward, not backward.

30:14.869 --> 30:16.946
I don't think it's your
business to have an opinion at all.

30:16.966 --> 30:19.447
I don't-I don't think that
Amy has made up her mind yet,

30:19.481 --> 30:21.315
have you, honey?

30:21.350 --> 30:23.784
Yes dad. I've made my decision.

30:23.818 --> 30:26.253
Well, Ahmed has been very generous.

30:26.287 --> 30:28.656
Actually he's not generous!

30:28.690 --> 30:30.758
He's fake and a liar. You don't understand.

30:30.792 --> 30:31.792
- Hey! Hey!
- That's enough...

30:31.826 --> 30:33.127
Georgie, stay out of it!

30:33.161 --> 30:34.728
He's pretending to be
friends with all of us

30:34.763 --> 30:36.667
just so he can steal Amy away from Ty.

30:36.687 --> 30:37.765
Honey...

30:37.799 --> 30:40.439
He told Amy he loved her, Ty.

30:40.459 --> 30:41.868
- Oh...
- He did!

30:42.445 --> 30:44.137
I hate you!

30:44.172 --> 30:47.607
Hey, Georgie.

30:48.048 --> 30:49.976
Excuse me. I got it.

30:50.010 --> 30:52.045
Okay, what is she talking about?

30:52.079 --> 30:53.246
I have no idea.

30:53.281 --> 30:55.345
Yes, you do.

30:55.365 --> 30:58.384
You know what?
I've seen it from the first with you.

30:58.418 --> 31:00.319
Trying to buy Amy's love
with fancy necklaces

31:00.353 --> 31:02.789
and trucks and horses.

31:02.823 --> 31:04.490
I'm sorry, but who do you think you are?

31:04.524 --> 31:06.759
- Lou! No.
- Excuse me?

31:06.794 --> 31:08.561
No. No.
You may think you're in love with my sister

31:08.581 --> 31:09.685
but you're not.

31:09.705 --> 31:12.131
If you did,
you would respect Amy and Ty's relationship

31:12.166 --> 31:14.466
and not try to ruin it.

31:14.501 --> 31:16.776
Okay, what the heck is going on?

31:16.796 --> 31:19.026
Amy, tell him.

31:19.046 --> 31:20.606
Tell him what?

31:20.640 --> 31:22.441
I told you I quit, but you don't listen.

31:22.475 --> 31:24.810
Look, I ended our relationship.

31:24.844 --> 31:26.412
Relationship?! What relationship?!

31:26.446 --> 31:29.025
Whoa, whoa!
Our working relationship... Ty-I have...

31:29.045 --> 31:31.616
Look, I quit a million times!

31:31.650 --> 31:34.989
But you only hear what you wanna hear!

31:35.138 --> 31:38.090
Think it would be a good idea if you left.

31:38.746 --> 31:40.926
Gladly.

31:40.960 --> 31:44.057
I certainly don't need to listen to this.

31:47.199 --> 31:49.701
No, Ty, just leave it.

31:54.039 --> 31:57.081
Hey, when did all this happen? Tell me!

31:57.101 --> 31:59.310
- I don't need to answer to you.
- Oh, yes, you do.

31:59.345 --> 32:01.446
Was it right from the start?

32:01.480 --> 32:04.598
Was it when you gave her that damn saddle?
Huh?

32:04.618 --> 32:06.951
- Was it?!
- Don't touch me!

32:06.985 --> 32:08.919
Where do you get off
telling her that you love her?

32:08.954 --> 32:11.922
Of course I love her.
I would do anything for her.

32:11.957 --> 32:16.106
And you! All you do is hold her back.

32:16.454 --> 32:18.328
You will be the man that
prevents her from a future

32:18.363 --> 32:21.531
you have no idea how to even imagine!

32:21.566 --> 32:25.752
She could have anything!
You will stand in her way!

32:26.337 --> 32:28.204
Ty!

32:28.239 --> 32:30.140
You can't do that to me!

32:30.174 --> 32:31.260
Oof!

32:31.280 --> 32:33.176
Yes, I can...

32:33.210 --> 32:35.711
C'mon now! Ease off...

32:35.746 --> 32:40.583
- Get off me!
- Enough! Enough!

32:44.146 --> 32:46.149
After all I did for you,

32:46.169 --> 32:49.308
this is how you want to leave things?!

33:20.128 --> 33:22.027
Ty...

33:23.218 --> 33:25.281
What was that about?

33:27.266 --> 33:29.096
Were you ever gonna tell me?

33:29.131 --> 33:32.689
There was nothing to tell!
It was all in his head!

33:34.253 --> 33:37.171
I don't even know what
to say to you right now!

33:37.802 --> 33:39.519
You always do this to me.

33:39.539 --> 33:41.914
- Do what?
- Secrets, Amy.

33:41.934 --> 33:44.045
You keep these damn secrets!

33:44.079 --> 33:45.880
Look,
he thought that we were more than friends,

33:45.914 --> 33:47.849
I told him we weren't! It's not my fault!

33:47.883 --> 33:49.951
I can't help that he thought
we were more than friends!

33:49.985 --> 33:51.452
I don't care what happened.
I don't care, Amy!

33:51.486 --> 33:53.254
Nothing happened!

33:53.288 --> 33:55.923
Whatever did happen,
you weren't about to tell me!

33:55.958 --> 33:59.271
And I had to face off with this damn idiot!

34:02.831 --> 34:06.219
When are you gonna be
straight with me, Amy? Huh?

34:10.822 --> 34:12.590
I've just about had it!

34:12.610 --> 34:15.034
What do you mean by that?

34:20.543 --> 34:23.649
Bob. Okay.

34:23.944 --> 34:26.485
Yeah. I'm on my way.

34:26.972 --> 34:29.822
The wolf is about to give birth.

34:34.460 --> 34:36.195
Ty! Wait!

34:52.601 --> 34:53.946
Honey, you okay?

34:53.966 --> 34:56.148
I'm sorry, Amy.

34:56.882 --> 34:58.017
It's okay.

34:58.037 --> 34:59.426
Let's just give her some space, okay?

35:07.637 --> 35:09.461
I didn't know. Nobody told me a thing.

35:09.495 --> 35:12.714
You think I would have
invited the guy for dinner?

35:15.159 --> 35:17.715
I didn't know, Jack.

35:20.472 --> 35:22.732
Easy. Her heart rate's dropping.

35:26.946 --> 35:28.676
Yeah. Her gums are pale too.

35:28.696 --> 35:30.910
She maybe be bleeding internally.

35:31.121 --> 35:33.955
- Shift over.
- It's okay. It's okay.

35:33.975 --> 35:35.792
Easy now.

35:39.187 --> 35:40.900
Her pups are coming...

35:44.501 --> 35:46.897
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:46.932 --> 35:49.060
- For you.
- Thank you.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.860
You're welcome.

35:52.109 --> 35:53.760
You okay?

35:56.316 --> 35:58.016
I messed up.

36:01.826 --> 36:05.924
Nobody... If I just known...

36:06.532 --> 36:12.104
You know, if people just... filled me in.

36:12.523 --> 36:16.076
Well,
sometimes these things can't be helped.

36:20.916 --> 36:23.933
So were you serious when you asked if I...

36:24.467 --> 36:27.314
would go on a rodeo tour with you?

36:27.334 --> 36:31.801
Yeah. Yes, I was.

36:33.017 --> 36:36.312
All right. I'm going.

36:47.186 --> 36:50.326
At least we saved one of them.

37:02.526 --> 37:03.903
Hello.

37:03.923 --> 37:05.540
Oh yes.

37:07.418 --> 37:10.566
Really? That is good news.

37:11.722 --> 37:14.157
That is very good news.

37:14.177 --> 37:18.051
Uh, how did she score on
her phonological processing?

37:19.044 --> 37:22.198
Really? That good?

37:22.232 --> 37:25.034
Yes, thank you for calling.

37:25.068 --> 37:26.835
Bye.

37:26.855 --> 37:28.938
Uh, that was Dr. Lauder's office,

37:28.972 --> 37:34.355
and um, Katie is fine, honey.
She's just fine.

37:39.987 --> 37:42.351
Wow! I can't believe it!

37:42.385 --> 37:44.019
Yep. Courtesy of Caleb.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.887
She how flashy she looks.

37:45.922 --> 37:48.924
Now this is a trick riding
horse if ever I saw one.

37:48.944 --> 37:50.076
Awww.

37:50.096 --> 37:52.645
I'm glad Caleb came through for you?

37:52.665 --> 37:54.996
Thanks, Ty, so she's beautiful.

37:55.031 --> 37:56.832
I'm glad you like her.

37:56.866 --> 37:59.721
Can I just say something...

38:01.503 --> 38:03.371
It was me who saw the video.

38:03.405 --> 38:05.240
And I never should have
told anyone about it.

38:05.274 --> 38:07.225
What video?

38:08.491 --> 38:11.258
I-I thought Amy told you.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.156
In the barn.

38:29.731 --> 38:33.430
Ty! I tried to call you...

38:33.450 --> 38:35.836
I'm so, so sorry about last night.

38:38.639 --> 38:40.774
How's the wolf?

38:42.877 --> 38:45.412
We lost her.

38:45.756 --> 38:47.804
I'm sorry.

38:49.316 --> 38:51.614
Yeah. I don't get it.

38:52.520 --> 38:55.462
She seemed to be in pretty good shape.

38:57.646 --> 39:00.649
I did everything, but...

39:03.515 --> 39:05.336
I lost her.

39:05.933 --> 39:07.566
One of the pups survived.

39:07.601 --> 39:10.958
He seems to be doing fine. So far.

39:10.978 --> 39:14.339
There's something I think you should see,

39:14.374 --> 39:17.674
something that started this whole mess.

39:17.694 --> 39:21.919
Some video? Georgie just told me.

39:22.316 --> 39:25.902
I should have never kept it from you.

39:26.605 --> 39:28.621
I don't wanna see it.

39:28.655 --> 39:30.355
I don't want to see anything, Amy.

39:30.390 --> 39:33.505
No. I want you to see it.

39:41.671 --> 39:45.337
And right after that I pushed him away.

39:45.371 --> 39:48.339
And I told him that we were just friends.

39:48.373 --> 39:50.437
And I-I thought he got it.

39:50.457 --> 39:53.800
But like I said,
Ahmed only hears what he wants to hear.

39:54.112 --> 39:56.080
Well, I guess I do too.

39:56.114 --> 39:58.483
What does that mean?

39:58.503 --> 40:03.154
Well, I guess I've been
convincing myself that we're good.

40:03.188 --> 40:04.388
But I'm not so sure right now.

40:04.423 --> 40:06.924
Ty, we... we are good.

40:06.959 --> 40:09.460
Amy, listen to me.

40:09.809 --> 40:12.311
I have to say this, okay?

40:12.651 --> 40:14.966
You've changed.

40:15.207 --> 40:16.788
How have I changed?

40:16.808 --> 40:19.269
You just have.

40:19.303 --> 40:21.037
You're not the same girl.

40:21.072 --> 40:22.973
Yes, I am. I am the same.

40:23.255 --> 40:26.035
No. You're not.

40:26.879 --> 40:29.963
You used to be this girl who...

40:30.782 --> 40:34.145
You used to be this girl who
would do anything to save a horse

40:34.165 --> 40:37.359
when everyone else was
writing off as a lost cause.

40:37.379 --> 40:39.189
You rescued them. You fought for them.

40:39.223 --> 40:42.025
You fixed them!

40:42.045 --> 40:43.964
Where has that gone?

40:44.597 --> 40:49.313
Now you're just servicing
rich people's horses.

40:49.598 --> 40:51.729
What is that?

40:52.473 --> 40:56.071
They don't need rescuing!
They don't need you.

40:56.444 --> 40:58.504
And that video...

40:59.559 --> 41:01.644
I just watched a wolf and her pup die...

41:01.678 --> 41:03.746
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry.

41:03.780 --> 41:05.548
Now you're showing me this video

41:05.582 --> 41:07.913
with people partying,
and living it up and...

41:08.583 --> 41:11.887
I guess that was your life over there.

41:11.921 --> 41:14.289
I just don't feel like
I know you anymore...

41:14.324 --> 41:18.219
- And now this Ahmed thing is...
- There was no Ahmed thing.

41:24.090 --> 41:26.411
I think we need a break.

41:26.431 --> 41:29.203
We need to figure this out... on our own.

41:29.238 --> 41:31.156
No. Ty, come on!

41:31.176 --> 41:33.562
I love you so much.

41:35.044 --> 41:39.084
And I love you too... I do Amy.

41:39.104 --> 41:41.882
But we need some time to figure
out what it is that we want.

41:41.917 --> 41:43.084
What you want.

41:43.118 --> 41:45.333
I know what I want.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.888
Maybe.

41:49.958 --> 41:52.760
But sometimes we lose things

41:52.794 --> 41:55.196
and no matter how hard we try to hold on

41:55.230 --> 41:58.265
or without even knowing it...

41:58.929 --> 42:00.834
we've lost it.

42:01.572 --> 42:03.235
No.

42:07.265 --> 42:08.742
No...

42:09.449 --> 42:11.178
Please...

42:11.819 --> 42:13.581
Ty no...

43:27.774 --> 43:30.820

43:31.360 --> 43:33.323
Heartbreak on heartland.

43:33.343 --> 43:35.030
What? It's not like
he came to see me.

43:35.050 --> 43:37.263
Now it's up to
Georgie to put things right.

43:37.265 --> 43:38.907
It's all my fault.

43:38.927 --> 43:40.905
- We're still good, right?
- Nothing's changed.

43:40.925 --> 43:42.100
Everything's changed.

43:42.102 --> 43:43.461
An all-new heartland,

43:43.481 --> 43:45.769
next Sunday at 7:00 on CBC
