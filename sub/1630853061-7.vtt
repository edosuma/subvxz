00:09.052 --> 00:10.314

00:10.358 --> 00:12.055
- Oh, tough crowd.
But I got 'em back.

00:12.099 --> 00:14.927
- What about that heckler?
- Ah, didn't bother me one bit.

00:14.971 --> 00:17.104
Don't forget I'm a Tony-
award-winning actor, Randall.

00:17.147 --> 00:18.496
I can handle myself on stage.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.324
- No one could ever forget
your Valjean.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.326
But with the Julien situation

00:22.370 --> 00:25.068
becoming a runaway
freight train of bad PR,

00:25.112 --> 00:26.504
you're now trailing
in Tennessee.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.419
- That's why I came here
to assure the voters

00:28.463 --> 00:29.855
that I'm still
the same candidate,

00:29.899 --> 00:31.770
the same guy who they've
known and supported before.

00:31.814 --> 00:34.164
- I just assumed
you'd be a little nervous.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.513
- Nah,
I'm used to tough crowds.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.689
- From your wrestling days?
- No, before that.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.865
When I was 15,
living in Nashville, Tennessee,

00:39.909 --> 00:42.520
I was gonna be the next great
country western singer.

00:42.564 --> 00:44.000
Now, let me tell you something.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.045
It did not go well.

You sure you wanna do this?

00:51.834 --> 00:53.966
- Definitely.
This woman at the Piggly-Wiggly

00:54.010 --> 00:55.446
said I had the voice
of an angel.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.405

and said she was 40?

somethin' like that.

[banjo playing]

01:00.538 --> 01:02.410

These sidewalks are crowded.

- Yeah, it's Nashville.

01:03.585 --> 01:05.413

Look, I don't mean
to be a downer, all right?

01:22.299 --> 01:24.084
But there's some stiff
competition out here,

01:24.127 --> 01:25.824
and folks are
mighty territorial.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.739
I mean, you'll be lucky
to get a free corner.

01:27.783 --> 01:28.827
- I don't need a corner.

01:28.871 --> 01:30.916
I'll set up right here,
mid-block.

- Why would dating other people
make our marriage stronger?

01:55.289 --> 01:56.768
- Oh, I don't know.
It would finally give us

01:56.812 --> 01:58.248
something to talk about.

Every news outlet was in town
covering the rally.

02:15.787 --> 02:17.485
So we'll find out here
pretty soon.

02:17.528 --> 02:19.965
- Now, are you sure
about this change of approach?

02:20.009 --> 02:21.880
- Can't just pretend a problem
doesn't exist.

02:21.924 --> 02:24.144
That was one of the many
lessons my old man taught me

02:24.187 --> 02:25.797
unintentionally.
- Hm, unintentional

02:25.841 --> 02:28.191
seems to be Rocky's
preferred method of teaching.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.801
- [laughs]
You're not wrong.

02:29.845 --> 02:31.629
I told you about that time
we moved to Nashville,

02:31.673 --> 02:34.458
and my dad blew it because he
didn't find us a place to live

02:34.502 --> 02:36.068
before me and my mom
came into town.

02:36.112 --> 02:38.506
- Yeah, you were living in
Downtown Bruno's motel room,

02:38.549 --> 02:40.551
eating eggs
he made on the toilet.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.379
- You know, when my mom
finally arrived in Nashville,

02:42.423 --> 02:43.772
things eventually
got a little better

02:43.815 --> 02:45.556
and she found us
an apartment to live in.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.949
She enrolled me in school.

02:46.992 --> 02:49.169
But she was still really angry
at my dad,

02:49.212 --> 02:50.474
understandably so.

02:50.518 --> 02:52.476
So my dad had to live
with Downtown Bruno

02:52.520 --> 02:53.782
every time he came into town.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.610
But I still saw him a lot

02:55.653 --> 02:57.264
and we would work out together
after school.

But it wasn't like
I wasn't angry at my dad

02:59.353 --> 03:00.963
because I was.

03:01.006 --> 03:04.314
But he was also my hero,

03:04.358 --> 03:06.055
and even though
things were tough,

03:06.098 --> 03:07.012
I still looked up to him.

03:10.538 --> 03:13.497
- Yo, Crusher,
ease up on the reps.

You don't wanna pull a muscle

03:14.542 --> 03:16.326

sold-out show.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.546

Damn.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.200
Jerry Lawler really knows
how to deliver.

03:20.243 --> 03:22.680

but it's coming together.

about a Jerry Lawler match
on Saturday.

Said it's another

Sounds like a fun show.

seeing your parents

05:22.409 --> 05:23.366

05:23.410 --> 05:25.150
- Well, my parents'
relationship

05:25.194 --> 05:27.239
always had its ups and downs,
and this wasn't the first time

05:27.283 --> 05:29.894
I've seen them go through
something like this.

05:29.938 --> 05:31.809
But Nashville was pretty rough.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.594
- Why is Bruno
driving your car?

05:33.637 --> 05:36.118
- It's better for Bruno
to drive in areas like this.

05:36.161 --> 05:37.380

05:37.424 --> 05:39.034
aren't too friendly
to, you know--

No, I--you know--
- Relax, Bruno.

05:43.168 --> 05:44.605
I know what you mean.
- [giggles]

05:44.648 --> 05:45.910
- Hey, hey, hey.
You're driving

05:45.954 --> 05:47.085
'cause you're white,
not 'cause you're good.

to the match tonight?

06:03.450 --> 06:04.929

for Vince now.

- Since when?
- Pat's not wrestling anymore?

I guess he got tired

so just do me a favor

06:11.849 --> 06:13.198

hard, all right?

think about this?

- Get down there!

06:25.080 --> 06:27.691
[audience boos]

06:27.735 --> 06:29.737
- My dad put on a good show
that day,

06:29.780 --> 06:32.304
and afterwards, it was my job
to take down the ring.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.568
I worked the ring crew with
Jerry Lawler's son, Brian,

06:34.611 --> 06:36.700
who would eventually become
one of my best friends.

06:36.744 --> 06:38.963
And believe it or not,
we were the same age.

06:39.007 --> 06:41.531
- One day, it'll be
me and you in the ring.

06:41.575 --> 06:42.924
We could even be a tag team.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.752
The Sons of Wrestling.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.536
- Eh, I don't know about that.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.016
I want a cool gimmick.

06:48.059 --> 06:51.454
You know, maybe something
beachy like Flip-Flop Force.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.804
- Hmm.

06:53.848 --> 06:55.850
- Great job tonight.
All right, we'll stay in touch.

06:58.113 --> 06:59.419
How'd you like the show?

06:59.462 --> 07:02.117
- Ah, the name Crusher Yurkov
is horrible!

07:02.160 --> 07:03.597
Vince thinks so too.

07:03.640 --> 07:06.164
It sounds like
a Russian trash compactor.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.689
- Ha.
- But aside from that,

07:08.732 --> 07:10.473
pretty good match.

Didn't hurt to have this guy
sellin' for you.

Rocky.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.087

- [laughing]

07:16.131 --> 07:17.698
- Thank you for the match.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.918
- You know where we're supposed
to put any of this stuff?

07:20.962 --> 07:23.051
- I've just been throwin' it
in the pile.

07:23.094 --> 07:25.532
- Scouting for the WWF.
- Eh.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.403
[both chuckle]
- How's that going?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.840
- Eh, it's a change of pace.
But I like it.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.408
Can't wrestle forever, right?
[laughs]

07:34.497 --> 07:37.021
- Hey, you gonna tell Vince
about the show tonight?

07:37.065 --> 07:40.198
- That's my job, isn't it?
[laughs]

07:40.242 --> 07:42.897
- Come on, Pat.
You heard that crowd.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.942
You should mention to him
how much they love me out here.

07:44.986 --> 07:47.205
- Oh, Rocky, come on.

07:47.249 --> 07:48.990
- Pat, you know
what kind of fan base

07:49.033 --> 07:50.861
I can bring to the WWF.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.297
All you gotta do
is put me back in--

07:52.341 --> 07:55.431
- That's not gonna happen.
You broke your contract.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.781
Vince had to make an example
after Saudi Arabia.

07:57.825 --> 08:01.045
- Come on, Pat.
That was...

08:01.089 --> 08:02.743
What?

08:02.786 --> 08:04.222
- Um, I was just gonna ask

they call me Dewey.

16:41.348 --> 16:42.784
Did you have a nickname
as a kid?

16:42.827 --> 16:44.873
- Oh, yeah, you know,
my cousin used to call me Twix

16:44.916 --> 16:46.788
because I ate so many Twix.
[laughs]

a lot of Twix.

I'm not trying to tell you
how to feel about your dad.

I get it if you're mad at him.
I'm mad at him all the time.

17:01.324 --> 17:02.934

with him?

17:05.024 --> 17:07.417

17:07.461 --> 17:10.029
You said earlier
that we don't need him.

17:10.072 --> 17:13.597
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we don't.

17:13.641 --> 17:16.426
Maybe he's the one
who needs us.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.776

in your purse, darlin'.

that moment of realizing

17:29.309 --> 17:31.485
your parents aren't perfect.

17:31.528 --> 17:32.964
They're just people
trying their best.

they're just people.
