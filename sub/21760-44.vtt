Cruella:
No peaking.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.830
I want this to be
a complete surprise.

01:17.830 --> 01:20.500
-And voila!

01:20.500 --> 01:21.920
Huh?

01:23.960 --> 01:26.250
Magnificent, are we not?

01:26.250 --> 01:28.420
This heavenly creature
is Vendella,

01:28.420 --> 01:31.120
the latest addition
to the De Vil dynasty.

01:32.290 --> 01:35.250
Congratulations, Cruella,
but since when did you...

01:35.250 --> 01:37.080
like dogs?

01:37.080 --> 01:39.250
Well, since
Tres Chi-Chi magazine

01:39.250 --> 01:40.790
announced it's doing
a cover story

01:40.790 --> 01:42.830
on the most stylish
fashion designer

01:42.830 --> 01:44.250
and dog combo.

01:44.250 --> 01:45.750
A cover story!

01:45.750 --> 01:49.500
For that kind of publicity,
I'd adopt a three-toed sloth.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.670
Guys, why don't you show
your new friend around, huh?

01:52.670 --> 01:54.670
-Come on, we'll show you
around the place.

01:54.670 --> 01:55.880
-Let's go!

01:55.880 --> 01:57.420
Do you think
that was wise?

01:57.420 --> 01:59.210
She's never been
with mutts before?

01:59.210 --> 02:01.170
She's delicate.
She has breeding,

02:01.170 --> 02:03.790
which will become obvious
when she takes first prize

02:03.790 --> 02:05.830
at the Grutely dog show.

02:09.080 --> 02:11.880
What a dump!

02:11.880 --> 02:14.330
Well, it's not fancy,
you know,

02:14.330 --> 02:16.830
but there's plenty
of places to dig,

02:16.830 --> 02:18.540
and there's
a big tree house,

02:18.540 --> 02:20.250
and lots of good smells.

02:20.250 --> 02:22.920
-How nice for you.
-Since we're gonna be neighbors,

02:22.920 --> 02:25.330
maybe you'd like to go
swimming with us sometime?

02:25.330 --> 02:29.120
And ruin my hairdo?
It is to laugh.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.460
Now, if you'll excuse me,

02:30.460 --> 02:33.670
I really can't afford to be seen
with black and white trash.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.000
-That rabid runt

02:37.000 --> 02:39.120
is antagonizing
my Vendella.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.250
Don't worry, precious.

02:41.250 --> 02:44.920
You'll never have to see those
common gutter mongrels again.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.460
Common gutter--

02:46.460 --> 02:49.120
We'll see about that!

02:49.120 --> 02:51.790
You know, it just so happens
we're entering our pups

02:51.790 --> 02:54.250
-in the dog show too!

02:54.250 --> 02:56.170
Well, you do that, Rotgut.

02:56.170 --> 02:59.750
After all, every show
needs some comic relief.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.040
A dog show?

03:07.540 --> 03:10.080
-Bravo! Bravo!

03:12.830 --> 03:14.620
Yahoo!

03:14.620 --> 03:16.000
Uh...

03:22.500 --> 03:25.000
Welcome to Haute Dog Academy.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.670
Now, if you'll follow me--

03:26.670 --> 03:27.920
you too, chicken,

03:27.920 --> 03:31.080
but remember you're here
as an observer--

03:31.080 --> 03:33.460
that's the last time
I give a group rate.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.000
Lucky:
This is gonna be great!

03:37.000 --> 03:39.960
This is where you train
to be a show dog.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.170
-Spot: It's like a dream.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.080
Dalmatians?

03:48.500 --> 03:52.040
I thought this school
had standards.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.580
Vendella:
These are those
filthy farm animals

03:59.580 --> 04:01.290
I was telling
you about.

04:01.290 --> 04:03.330
Why don't we step outside

04:03.330 --> 04:05.460
for a little
conflict resolution?

04:05.460 --> 04:07.620
-We are outside.

04:09.710 --> 04:11.880
Well then,
no need to wait.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.170
Guys, stop!

04:13.170 --> 04:15.830
-We'll get in troub--

04:15.830 --> 04:17.500
Puppies, enough play.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.210
There's much
to be learned today.

04:19.210 --> 04:21.290
So let the training begin!

04:23.040 --> 04:24.790
Knees apart, sit.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.250
Now watch your posture.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.620
Sit!

04:28.620 --> 04:29.670
Sit.

04:30.750 --> 04:32.290
Sit.

04:32.290 --> 04:33.920
Sit.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.040
Sit!

04:36.210 --> 04:38.120
And sit.

04:39.170 --> 04:40.170
Sit.

04:41.170 --> 04:42.670
And sit.

04:43.750 --> 04:44.920
Sit.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.120
-Sit.

04:50.170 --> 04:52.080
Well, at least
you smell good.

04:56.250 --> 04:57.380
That's it.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.500
Maybe it's time
you snobs

04:59.500 --> 05:01.420
learned to play dead!

05:02.960 --> 05:04.120
Stop! Sit!

05:05.920 --> 05:07.920
Stay! Heel!

05:12.460 --> 05:15.880
Classed dismissed, permanently!

05:19.790 --> 05:21.880
I've never seen
Roger so mad.

05:21.880 --> 05:25.790
I guess getting thrown out
of school wasn't too bright.

05:25.790 --> 05:28.040
Without training,

05:28.040 --> 05:30.120
we'll never beat Vendella.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.460
We might as well quit.

05:32.460 --> 05:36.670
You can't quit.
It's the ultimate honor
a dog can achieve,

05:36.670 --> 05:39.790
but, uh, I'm a chicken,

05:39.790 --> 05:43.080
so you guys are as close
as I can get to this.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.790
Hmm, hey, I'll coach you.

05:56.330 --> 05:58.120
Cruella:
I don't believe it!

05:58.120 --> 06:01.540
Those mongrels are acting
like pedigree show dogs!

06:01.540 --> 06:03.880
I won't have them
spoiling my plans.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.330
Jasper, Horace!

06:05.330 --> 06:07.540
You're going
to the Grutely dog show.

06:07.540 --> 06:09.960
But Horace isn't
housebroken yet.

06:09.960 --> 06:13.580
Aww, I prefer to say
that I am bladder challenged.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.080
Announcer: Leading off
the first discipline,

06:18.080 --> 06:20.710
the show walk,
Vendella De Vil.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.500
Now remember
everything I taught you.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.290
When the judges
ask you to speak,

06:27.290 --> 06:28.750
speak out!

06:28.750 --> 06:30.710
-That's the spirit, Lucky,

06:30.710 --> 06:32.170
but be a little
more positive.

06:32.170 --> 06:34.960
Let your personality
shine through.

06:36.250 --> 06:37.920
And above all
remember

06:37.920 --> 06:39.920
we're all
in this together.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.250
Right, guys?

06:41.250 --> 06:43.830
Guys

06:44.830 --> 06:46.920
Guys!
Where'd you go?!

06:49.380 --> 06:51.170
Good girl, now sit.

06:52.210 --> 06:53.250
Beg.

06:54.250 --> 06:55.790
Roll over.

06:57.460 --> 07:00.540
-Now speak.

07:00.540 --> 07:02.250
Now, girl, fetch!

07:09.000 --> 07:11.750
A near perfect routine.

07:11.750 --> 07:14.380
What do you mean
near perfect?

07:16.920 --> 07:18.750
Roger,
where are the pups?

07:18.750 --> 07:20.500
Anita:
It's almost their turn.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.460
-Hurry up, Horace.

07:25.460 --> 07:27.210
They're tussling
like wildcats.

07:27.210 --> 07:28.830
There you go.

07:28.830 --> 07:31.540
You'll all stay locked up
till the doggy show is over.

07:31.540 --> 07:32.960
And don't piddle.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.040
We're still making payments
on this van.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.960
So where are
your dogs, Roquefort?

07:48.960 --> 07:51.420
Afraid to face
my Vendella?

07:52.790 --> 07:54.750
-Hey, there's Spot.

07:56.380 --> 07:58.420
It's almost time
for them to perform.

08:00.420 --> 08:02.750
Lucky:
Help! We're locked in!

08:02.750 --> 08:04.790
-Lucky: Help!

08:04.790 --> 08:07.710
Mr. Dearly,
if your puppies aren't here,

08:07.710 --> 08:10.790
we'll have to disqualify them.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.000
I-I-if you give me
just a few more minutes,

08:13.000 --> 08:14.790
I'm sure they'll show up.

08:14.790 --> 08:16.250
I'm sorry.

08:18.210 --> 08:19.670
No, wait!

08:19.670 --> 08:22.170
Do the rules
specifically say

08:22.170 --> 08:24.670
that the contestant
has to be a dog?

08:24.670 --> 08:26.250
Dog?

08:26.250 --> 08:28.710
But of course it does.
Doesn't it?

08:28.710 --> 08:32.330
I'm not sure.
It's never come up before.

08:32.330 --> 08:35.710
Then we want to make
a substitute entry.

08:35.710 --> 08:38.040
A chicken in a dog show?

08:38.040 --> 08:39.670
That's crazy.

08:39.670 --> 08:40.750
This is Spot.

08:40.750 --> 08:43.120
True, she may not
look like a dog.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.540
She hasn't got
a wet nose

08:44.540 --> 08:46.120
or a waggy tail,

08:46.120 --> 08:47.500
but just look at her.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.830
She's bright.
She's friendly.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.250
She's obedient
and she's loyal.

08:52.250 --> 08:55.290
She's about the most
faithful friend anyone can have.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.710
We got to figure
a way out of here.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.000
How about hitting
some of these buttons?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.750
Sounds like
a plan to me.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.080
Rolly:
Now it looks like

09:21.080 --> 09:22.880
-we're getting somewhere.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.330
Whoa!

09:30.960 --> 09:33.120
When will people learn...

09:33.120 --> 09:36.460
That cooping up dogs
is inhumane...

09:36.460 --> 09:38.670
Not to mention illegal.

09:40.750 --> 09:44.210
Judge:
Now a substitute entry
from Dearly farm,

09:44.210 --> 09:46.330
-Spot.

09:49.670 --> 09:51.420
Huh?

09:51.420 --> 09:53.250
Where have you been?

09:53.250 --> 09:54.920
I had to send
Spot in for you.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.920
Good girl.
Now sit.

10:04.920 --> 10:07.000
Now, Spot, beg.

10:11.580 --> 10:13.000
-Oh.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
-Isn't that the most
touching thing

10:15.000 --> 10:16.750
you have ever seen?

10:16.750 --> 10:18.670
There's nothing
quite so moving

10:18.670 --> 10:20.750
as a blubbering entree.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.920
Now, girl, fetch.

10:49.710 --> 10:52.670
What a fetch!
What a performance!

10:52.670 --> 10:54.670
Judge:
What a dog!

10:58.710 --> 11:00.670
-Yay!
-Yeah!

11:02.500 --> 11:04.620
You won first prize, Spot.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.620
It's a classic example

11:06.620 --> 11:08.540
of hard work
paying off.

11:08.540 --> 11:12.250
Nah, I just think
the best dog won.

11:12.250 --> 11:15.040
My dream come true!

11:19.380 --> 11:21.620
Memo to myself:
next time,

11:21.620 --> 11:23.710
remember to bribe the judges.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.710
Whew, all this aimless walking

11:57.710 --> 11:59.710
really takes it out of you.

11:59.710 --> 12:02.170
I am dying for a snack.

12:04.620 --> 12:07.080
Hey, hey, sucker alert.

12:07.080 --> 12:10.580
Ooh, I've been
waiting for this all day.

12:18.120 --> 12:21.120
Be cool.
He's almost in position.

12:24.170 --> 12:26.120
I wish I had
a soup bone

12:26.120 --> 12:28.080
or-- or a corn fritter

12:28.080 --> 12:31.040
or even a teeny tiny
piece of kib...

12:34.790 --> 12:36.290
...ble.

12:36.290 --> 12:38.500
Oh, papa!

12:39.750 --> 12:41.380
Huh?

12:46.040 --> 12:47.040
Again.

12:50.540 --> 12:52.710
Okay, okay,
reel him in.

13:02.920 --> 13:06.580
Ha ha ha, very funny.

13:06.580 --> 13:08.170
Help him up, Whiz.

13:13.710 --> 13:17.290
Oh, you guys
are a laugh riot.

13:17.290 --> 13:19.170
Only kidding, Rolly.

13:19.170 --> 13:20.500
No hard feelings.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.420
Thank you very much.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.500
So they got you with
the kibble on a string gag, huh?

13:36.500 --> 13:39.080
The oldest trick
in the book.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.580
Why don't you
just say it?

13:43.580 --> 13:46.420
Rolly,
you're the world's
biggest dope.

13:47.420 --> 13:49.540
Look, you trust folks.

13:49.540 --> 13:51.500
That doesn't
make you a dope.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.170
It makes you a nice guy.

13:53.170 --> 13:55.750
Well, I've had it
with being a nice guy!

13:55.750 --> 13:58.330
What good is being
a nice guy

13:58.330 --> 14:00.420
if people think
you're a bone head

14:00.420 --> 14:02.120
or a sucker,
or-- or--

14:02.120 --> 14:05.670
Chump
Stooge

14:05.670 --> 14:08.500
I got a thesaurus
for Christmas.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.830
Okay, maybe you are a sucker,

14:10.830 --> 14:12.460
but we like you that way.

14:12.460 --> 14:15.290
Yeah, and you're in
good company.

14:15.290 --> 14:17.880
After all,
there's a sucker
born every minute.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.380
Dang!

14:24.380 --> 14:27.080
Where am I gonna find
a sucker with an innocent face

14:27.080 --> 14:29.380
that's gullible enough
to work for peanuts?

14:29.380 --> 14:34.330
Oh! Rackin frackin
indelible ink!

14:36.500 --> 14:39.420
Of course I don't think
you're a sucker.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.500
You're just an
honest, forthright,

14:41.500 --> 14:43.330
moral citizen, see?

14:43.330 --> 14:46.290
Now, Mooch and his bunch
is another matter.

14:46.290 --> 14:49.380
Well, I'd like to give 'em
a taste of their own medicine.

14:49.380 --> 14:52.380
Son, you've come
to the right rat.

15:02.330 --> 15:05.960
Excuse me, sonny,
but could you direct me

15:05.960 --> 15:07.380
to Hiccup Hole?

15:07.380 --> 15:09.330
Oh, um, sure.

15:09.330 --> 15:11.790
Um, first you head
down to that silo there,

15:11.790 --> 15:13.920
-and then--

15:13.920 --> 15:17.710
-Ooh, a wittle baby.

15:17.710 --> 15:20.210
Oobie doobie gah.

15:20.210 --> 15:23.420
Itty bitty baby.

15:23.420 --> 15:26.620
-Genuine silver.

15:26.620 --> 15:27.880
Say dada.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.580
Hey, don't I know him?

15:30.580 --> 15:32.880
Thanks so much. Go!

15:32.880 --> 15:35.330
No prob-- Ah!

15:35.330 --> 15:38.830
Where'd my new collar go?!

15:38.830 --> 15:41.710
Man, that was great!

15:43.920 --> 15:45.620
You ain't seen nothing yet.

15:51.380 --> 15:53.500
-Hey, man!

15:53.500 --> 15:54.880
Find the kibble.

15:56.120 --> 15:59.330
It's easy as one,
two, three, man.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.790
Can I try, mister?

16:02.790 --> 16:05.710
Wake up, bubble butt,
it's rigged.

16:05.710 --> 16:08.120
-There's no way
that you can--
-Why, I won!

16:08.120 --> 16:09.920
I won!
I won!

16:09.920 --> 16:11.460
Whoopie!

16:11.460 --> 16:13.540
Hey, let's play again.

16:15.170 --> 16:16.250
My turn.

16:16.250 --> 16:18.170
I'll bet one chew toy.

16:21.750 --> 16:26.120
Eeny meeny miny moe!

16:30.120 --> 16:31.330
Sucker.

16:32.330 --> 16:33.380
Hey!

16:35.750 --> 16:37.830
Well, kid,
you sheered them stooges

16:37.830 --> 16:39.580
like spring lambs.

16:39.580 --> 16:42.250
You are a natural
born con-man.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.830
-I love it.

16:44.830 --> 16:49.040
In fact, I got
a few ideas of my own.

16:49.040 --> 16:52.420
Gosh, you got
a real cute baby, lady.

16:54.880 --> 16:58.210
Why thank you
kind bunny, sir.

16:58.210 --> 17:00.710
Oh, I just love babies.

17:00.710 --> 17:01.920
Cootchie cootchie
cootchie coo.

17:03.170 --> 17:04.920
Reminds me of
my own little ones.

17:06.120 --> 17:08.210
Anyways, turn left
at the stump

17:08.210 --> 17:10.330
and you'll come
to Hiccup Hole.
Bye now.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.120
Thank you.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.620
See you later.

17:15.620 --> 17:17.080
Both: Sucker!

17:18.620 --> 17:20.120
Ooh, I've been
thinking, Swamps.

17:20.120 --> 17:21.710
We got to branch out.

17:21.710 --> 17:24.620
I mean, why stop
at collars and carrots?

17:24.620 --> 17:26.580
Why not go
for the big prizes?

17:26.580 --> 17:29.380
Like pot roasts!

17:29.380 --> 17:30.960
Yeah!

17:30.960 --> 17:34.210
You are greedy, kid!
I like that.

17:34.210 --> 17:37.120
Of course,
if we're gonna expand,

17:37.120 --> 17:39.670
I want to be
an equal partner.

17:39.670 --> 17:41.120
What are you talking about?

17:41.120 --> 17:44.170
Well, son, if I'm doing
half the work,

17:44.170 --> 17:47.170
I should get half the profits.

17:47.170 --> 17:50.790
Tell you what,
I'm gonna give you a chance
at the big time.

17:50.790 --> 17:53.330
There is a new mark
coming in tonight

17:53.330 --> 17:55.500
from my top secret
gambling party.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.460
His name's Mr. Big.

17:57.460 --> 18:00.880
Help me pull this one off,
and I'll make you my partner.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.750
No more
mister trusting.

18:05.750 --> 18:08.080
No more mister gullible.

18:08.080 --> 18:11.120
As of today,
I am Ruthless Rolly,

18:11.120 --> 18:13.080
king of the scams.

18:15.500 --> 18:18.880
What do you mean
you lost our food?

18:19.880 --> 18:23.210
I got to talking
to this dog in a housecoat,

18:23.210 --> 18:27.120
-and...
-Frank, do you know
what this means?

18:27.120 --> 18:29.580
Not only are we
gonna go hungry,

18:29.580 --> 18:32.580
the kids are
gonna starve too.

18:32.580 --> 18:36.170
We're hungry.
We're hungry.

18:36.170 --> 18:38.040
Bunnies:
We're hungry!

18:38.040 --> 18:39.170
Oh no.

18:39.170 --> 18:41.250
What have I done?

18:41.250 --> 18:43.790
It sounds to me
like you've starved a family

18:43.790 --> 18:45.460
of painfully cute bunnies.

18:45.460 --> 18:47.290
What got into you, Rolly?

18:47.290 --> 18:48.620
I don't know.

18:48.620 --> 18:50.290
I guess I just--

18:50.290 --> 18:52.670
I wanted to
get back at Mooch
and his gang

18:52.670 --> 18:55.880
and I kind of got
carried away.

18:55.880 --> 18:59.290
I forgot how bad it feels
when folks cheat you.

18:59.290 --> 19:01.210
There's only
one thing to do.

19:01.210 --> 19:03.330
Give the stuff back?!

19:03.330 --> 19:05.710
Have you gone
barn wacky?

19:05.710 --> 19:08.040
I don't give nothing back,

19:08.040 --> 19:09.080
nothing!

19:09.080 --> 19:11.000
I figured you knew that,
little chubby puppy!

19:11.000 --> 19:14.080
Everything
is riding on tonight.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.620
Now, what's it gonna be?
Are you in or out?

19:15.620 --> 19:17.250
In or out, in or out?
Come on?

19:22.120 --> 19:23.750
-You're late.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.120
He's already here.
Come on.

19:26.120 --> 19:29.080
It's simple.
This wheel is fixed.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.830
There's a keyboard
under that table.

19:30.830 --> 19:33.040
Now whatever number
Mr. Big calls out,

19:33.040 --> 19:34.210
you hit another number.

19:34.210 --> 19:37.120
Just remember
don't let him win.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.170
Well, Mr. Big,
let's get a-going.

19:40.170 --> 19:42.330
Round and round she goes,

19:42.330 --> 19:45.580
and where she stops,
nobody knows.

19:51.580 --> 19:53.040
Twenty cents.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.210
Achoo!

20:05.250 --> 20:08.460
Step up
and place your bets.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.040
Uh, 22.

20:19.330 --> 20:20.790
Ahh!

20:22.080 --> 20:23.790
What are you doing?

20:25.540 --> 20:28.500
I'm sorry,
I got this cold,
and I...

20:28.500 --> 20:31.040
Now, if you're thinking
about conning me,

20:31.040 --> 20:33.210
think again
'cause if I lose,

20:33.210 --> 20:36.250
you're gonna have something
a whole lot worse than a cold!

20:37.880 --> 20:40.580
Last spin, last win.

20:40.580 --> 20:43.790
The whole shebang on 13.

20:43.790 --> 20:45.330
Oh.

20:48.040 --> 20:52.120
Whoa! Ha ha!
Oh, now, ain't that a shame.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.710
Sometimes lady luck
just don't feel like smiling.

20:55.710 --> 20:59.000
You! I saw that
paw move, pup!

20:59.000 --> 21:00.540
-This game is rigged!

21:05.460 --> 21:08.080
Look, we got to save Rolly.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.420
Take that!

21:15.790 --> 21:19.620
-Save yourself, rat!
-But my winnings!

21:19.620 --> 21:22.040
Leave 'em!
They're crazy when
they get like this!

21:31.210 --> 21:34.580
Yeah, I told you
my plan would work.

21:34.580 --> 21:37.250
And it did.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.380
This was the only way
we'd ever get back

21:39.380 --> 21:40.670
everybody's loot.

21:40.670 --> 21:42.380
Thanks to me!

21:42.380 --> 21:46.080
Okay, you're gonna give
this stuff back to the dogs.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.580
And the food
back to the rabbits,

21:47.580 --> 21:50.750
and then it's the straight
and narrow, right?

21:50.750 --> 21:53.080
Uh, okay.

21:55.290 --> 21:58.000
See, all's well
that ends well.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I just have one question.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.420
What happened
to the real Mr. Big?
