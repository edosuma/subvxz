WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:06.074
(indistinct conversations)

00:14.715 --> 00:17.451
(cell phone ringtone playing)

00:35.536 --> 00:37.771
That's ten grand
to you, Pop.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.774
(laughing)
Too rich for my blood.

00:40.808 --> 00:44.212
5,000 to you, Francis.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.185
I call.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.189
Read 'em and weep.

00:55.223 --> 00:56.557
Three queens.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.226
Ooh.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.094
Pair of deuces.

01:00.128 --> 01:02.730
Knew you were bluffing
when your eye started to twitch.

01:02.763 --> 01:05.166
And three kings...

01:05.199 --> 01:07.568
to fill the house.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.337
(Henry chuckling)

01:09.370 --> 01:11.272
You dog.

01:11.305 --> 01:14.208
All right, well, I'm busted.

01:14.242 --> 01:16.544
What's my credit line?

01:16.577 --> 01:19.147
Uh, you owe me $243,000.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.681
(Henry chuckling)

01:20.714 --> 01:23.551
I liked it better
when you used to let me win.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.220
Your deal.
Okay.

01:26.254 --> 01:28.722
The game is
Chicago Night Baseball.
(door opens and closes)

01:28.756 --> 01:30.358
No peeky,
threes and nines wild,

01:30.391 --> 01:31.692
buy a card for 1,000.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.127
ERIN:
Sorry, guys.

01:34.895 --> 01:35.863
Hey, want to sit in?

01:35.896 --> 01:37.398
No, we have to get home.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.800
Oh, but I can just
feel the cards

01:39.833 --> 01:41.169
turning Nicky's way.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.570
It's an early one
for both of us.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.172
Nicky is going to spend
the day at work

01:44.205 --> 01:45.506
with me tomorrow.
FRANK:
Wow.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.874
It's Take Your Daughter
to Work Day.

01:46.907 --> 01:50.178
I'll bet none
of your friends' parents

01:50.211 --> 01:52.646
have as exciting a job
as your mom.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.782
Actually, I wanted to go
on a ride-along

01:54.815 --> 01:58.552
with Uncle Danny or Uncle Jamie,
but I knew that'd never fly.

01:58.586 --> 01:59.820
Well, maybe you should stop

01:59.853 --> 02:01.589
assuming things about me
all the time.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.658
Okay. Can I go on a ride-along
with Uncle Danny or Uncle Jamie?

02:04.692 --> 02:05.893
Absolutely not.

02:05.926 --> 02:07.261
Thanks, Your Majesty.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.200
She hates me.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.801
The hardest day at work

02:13.834 --> 02:16.270
is easier than any day
raising a teenager.

02:16.304 --> 02:17.338
Amen to that.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.639
Good luck.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.174
Hmm...

02:21.575 --> 02:23.211
Cut for deal.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.678
Okay.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.570
Hey! Hey, hey!

02:49.603 --> 02:51.472
Hey, wh... what are you doing?!

02:51.505 --> 02:53.241
Hey, hey!

02:53.274 --> 02:53.941
(whimpers)

02:53.974 --> 02:55.276
Shh.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.444
Oh, my...!

03:02.650 --> 03:04.985
Any of you nachos move,

03:05.018 --> 03:07.655
I'll execute every one of you.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.657
Check it, man.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.434
Hey.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.303
Look what we got here.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.437
(laughing)

03:23.471 --> 03:24.805
That's it?

03:26.440 --> 03:28.642
I know you people
don't use banks,

03:28.676 --> 03:29.910
so where's the rest of it, huh?

03:29.943 --> 03:31.479
Where is it?

03:35.449 --> 03:38.386
Where's the rest of
your money, chica, eh?

03:40.388 --> 03:41.822
No! No! No! No! No!

03:41.855 --> 03:43.557
(shouting)

03:43.591 --> 03:46.560
I'm going to count
to three, okay?

03:46.594 --> 03:47.995
One.

03:48.028 --> 03:50.298
In-in the box over there,
on the shelf!

03:59.507 --> 04:01.008
Hurry up.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.377
We're out of here.

04:05.513 --> 04:06.947
Adios, amigos.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.285
Come on!

04:12.386 --> 04:15.255
(crying)

04:18.592 --> 04:20.694
Finally, a slow
night in the city.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.963
We get to enjoy a
civilized meal for once.

04:22.996 --> 04:23.931
This is civilized?

04:23.964 --> 04:26.767
We should be glad
we're not downtown, though.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.702
That student protest
turned into a riot.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.671
Ah, is there ever a
night in this city

04:30.704 --> 04:32.005
when somebody's not
protesting something?

04:32.039 --> 04:33.307
What are they
protesting now anyway?

04:33.341 --> 04:34.775
Tuition hikes.
Tuition hikes?

04:34.808 --> 04:37.044
My old man paid a fortune
on my kid brother's tuition.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.579
Look what good it did him.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.381
Somebody should
protest the Mets

04:40.414 --> 04:41.915
calling themselves
a professional sports team.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.385
Back up.
Hold on.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.919
DISPATCHER:
Confines of the two-seven
precinct,

04:45.953 --> 04:48.356
report of shots fired
at 176 and Cabrini.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.590
That's not far from here.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.724
Yeah.

04:50.758 --> 04:54.061
Show Manhattan detectives
responding to shots fired.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.596
So much for
a quiet night.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.930
Yeah.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.533
(siren whooping)

05:02.370 --> 05:03.771
Call for a bus, Jack.

05:03.804 --> 05:04.738
Yeah.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.774
Forthwith!

05:14.982 --> 05:16.884
Come on...

05:16.917 --> 05:19.353
Jack, hurry it up!

05:52.152 --> 05:53.654
Two reported rapes,
the three-one and the 15th,

05:53.687 --> 05:55.423
and a homicide in
the two-seven.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.625
I want CompStat reports
for all precincts

05:57.658 --> 05:58.892
and updates on the homicide.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.093
The mayor asked

06:00.127 --> 06:02.430
to move your weekly
briefing up an hour.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.665
Can do.
Already done.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.435
If you're going to eat
that here,

06:07.468 --> 06:09.937
you better have
brought two.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.040
Over easy?

06:13.073 --> 06:15.509
The only thing
in this office that is.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.613
Three students were arrested
for assault last night

06:19.647 --> 06:21.715
during a demonstration
at Hudson University.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.484
In custody
and awaiting arraignment.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.653
Our job is done there.
You wish.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.154
People get murdered
every day, Frank,

06:27.187 --> 06:29.089
but three middle-class
kids get arrested

06:29.122 --> 06:31.792
outside their college for
protesting tuition hikes--

06:31.825 --> 06:33.661
that's news.
Says who?

06:33.694 --> 06:37.030
Says a full voice mail
box and 100 e-mails.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.600
That's what you think we
should be paying attention to?

06:39.633 --> 06:43.771
Not what we should be;
what we will be.

06:48.642 --> 06:49.710
He was hit with two bullets.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.178
One of them lacerated his liver,

06:51.211 --> 06:53.514
and the other one gave him
a slow aortic leak.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.682
There was nothing
we could do.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.917
You guys find any I.D. on him?

06:56.950 --> 06:59.520
Sorry.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.722
(sighs)
Decedent's property.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.024
Check this out.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.659
Oh.

07:05.693 --> 07:08.562
Dead guy with a bag
of cash and no I.D.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.564
Exactly. Maybe it was
a drug deal gone bad?

07:10.598 --> 07:12.666
Something definitely went bad.
You get a count on this?

07:12.700 --> 07:13.801
Yeah, it's $325.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.068
325 bucks?

07:15.102 --> 07:16.904
Mm-hmm.
Never ceases to amaze me

07:16.937 --> 07:19.540
what some people will
kill each other for.

07:25.579 --> 07:28.215
So what prepared you most
for this career?

07:28.248 --> 07:30.618
Having three brothers.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.053
If I wasn't
negotiating a truce

07:33.086 --> 07:35.556
between two of them,
then I was trying

07:35.589 --> 07:37.791
to prove that
I was one of them.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.729
Thing you love the most?

07:41.762 --> 07:42.730
You.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.164
About your job.

07:46.233 --> 07:49.770
Speaking for people
who can't speak for themselves,

07:49.803 --> 07:53.607
trying to make sure
that justice is done for them.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.576
How is it working
with defense attorneys?

07:55.609 --> 07:58.679
Well, we're on
opposing sides,

07:58.712 --> 08:01.849
but I can always appreciate
a good attorney.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.851
Did you ever go up against Dad?

08:03.884 --> 08:05.185
In court?

08:05.218 --> 08:06.987
Of course, in court.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.222
Only in mock trials
in law school.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.527
Was he any good?

08:14.795 --> 08:17.965
I would recommend him
as an attorney.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.869
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

08:21.902 --> 08:23.203
Like what?

08:23.236 --> 08:24.672
Nothing.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.540
I just want to make sure
everything's okay.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.542
Everything's fine.

08:30.778 --> 08:33.213
How would you describe
your typical day at work?

08:35.215 --> 08:37.985
We have a suspect in custody
on the rape in the 15th,

08:38.018 --> 08:40.888
and the homicide
investigation is ongoing.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.322
It's going to be a tough one.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.891
We don't have much.

08:45.793 --> 08:48.128
Frank, what about
those student protesters?

08:48.161 --> 08:49.162
What about them?

08:50.163 --> 08:53.133
You know, my first year at Yale,
a bunch of us

08:53.166 --> 08:55.669
camped out on the quad
to protest apartheid.

08:55.703 --> 08:58.138
I don't think any
college education is complete

08:58.171 --> 08:59.773
without a little
righteous indignation.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.876
It wasn't righteous indignation
that got them arrested.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.578
It was assaulting
police officers.

09:04.612 --> 09:05.913
That's a felony.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.881
Had the New Haven Police
arrested me,

09:07.915 --> 09:10.718
a record would have prevented me
from going into public office.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.587
But you knew where
to draw the line.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.288
Or I just got lucky.

09:15.322 --> 09:16.757
(sighs)

09:16.790 --> 09:18.792
Local cops
versus college students

09:18.826 --> 09:21.294
is a classic
town and gown, Frank.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.897
There's always room
for mistakes on both sides.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.834
The arrests were legitimate,
Mr. Mayor.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.702
If you have an issue...

09:30.037 --> 09:31.338
No, Frank.

09:31.371 --> 09:32.740
No issue at all.

09:32.773 --> 09:33.941
Just airing it out.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.944
Next item: your appearance at
the Knicks game on Saturday.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.779
We need to talk
about security.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.113
Absolutely.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.653
Looks like the blood starts
right around here, Jack.

09:45.686 --> 09:46.854
Yeah, well, the 911 caller

09:46.887 --> 09:47.888
is an old lady
from that building.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.957
Said she heard three shots,
looked out the window

09:49.990 --> 09:51.792
and saw two guys
running up the block.

09:51.825 --> 09:52.760
Two guys?
Yep,
no description.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.328
No one saw anything,
so we have no witnesses.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.964
Of course not.
This neighborhood, we got

09:56.997 --> 09:58.365
a better chance
of bumping into Santa Claus.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.167
Oh, well,
if you see him, tell him

10:00.200 --> 10:02.169
I'm still waiting
on my Barbie Dream House.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.204
Oh, the SPRINT system said
there were a couple of calls

10:04.237 --> 10:05.906
about a domestic right
before the shots rang out

10:05.939 --> 10:08.008
coming from the basement
apartment over there.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.910
We should take
a look at it.
All right.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.712
By the way,
it had a, uh,

10:11.745 --> 10:13.681
working doorbell and
a hot tub, you know?

10:13.714 --> 10:14.915
What did?
The Barbie Dream House.

10:14.948 --> 10:15.849
Erin had one.

10:15.883 --> 10:18.285
She used to let me use
it as a bachelor pad

10:18.318 --> 10:19.953
for my G.I. Joes.
Ah, that makes sense.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.989
Docket number 45972,

10:22.022 --> 10:24.057
People v. Ariel Winston

10:24.091 --> 10:26.126
on the charge of assault
in the second degree

10:26.159 --> 10:28.228
against a police officer
and disorderly conduct

10:28.261 --> 10:30.130
occurring on the campus of
Hudson University.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.032
How do you plead?

10:32.065 --> 10:32.866
Not guilty, Your Honor.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.034
Bail?

10:34.067 --> 10:35.903
State requests
$2,000 bail.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.705
Because this 18-year-old
honor student

10:37.738 --> 10:39.206
is a big flight risk?

10:39.239 --> 10:41.441
No, because Ms. Winston threw
objects at police officers.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.876
Allegedly.
We request Ms. Winston

10:42.910 --> 10:44.144
be released
on her own recognizance.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.880
ERIN:
Your Honor, my office has
corroborating evidence,

10:46.914 --> 10:50.417
including eyewitness testimony
and numerous cell phone videos.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.185
Ms. Winston jumped
on an officer.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.021
Trying to help
her friend.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.255
Come on.
These are college students.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.024
To whom the law applies.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.092
Protesting social injustice
is a rite of passage.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.695
Your Honor, I'd like to
remind counsel that this is

11:01.729 --> 11:02.896
an arraignment, not a trial.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.331
Exactly, Mr. Skolnik.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.966
A right of passage
that is protected

11:05.999 --> 11:07.034
under the Constitution.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.069
ERIN: But carried out
without permits,

11:09.102 --> 11:12.105
and in a manner that endangered
pedestrians and motorists.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.307
Bail is set at $1,000.

11:21.448 --> 11:24.117
The only threat I see
is from overzealous cops,

11:24.151 --> 11:25.452
and overzealous ADAs.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.888
You haven't seen anything yet,
Counselor.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.790
Beautiful, but overzealous.

11:29.823 --> 11:32.726
And immune to your charms.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.795
You guys were
really going at it.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.063
That was great.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.465
He was awesome.

11:38.498 --> 11:41.101
Excuse me, Ms. Boyle?

11:41.134 --> 11:43.136
Is there somewhere
that we could talk?

11:45.105 --> 11:48.041
WOMAN:
I wasn't arguing with
my husband last night.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.509
Well, the neighbors said
they heard, uh, shouting

11:49.542 --> 11:50.377
coming from the apartment.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.979
MAN: They must have
made a mistake.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.814
It wasn't coming
from here.

11:53.847 --> 11:57.084
How'd you get
those bruises, ma'am?

11:57.117 --> 11:58.218
She fell.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.087
Did she fall on somebody's fist?

12:02.022 --> 12:03.857
Did you hear
the shots last night?

12:03.891 --> 12:05.993
No, we didn't.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.528
How about you let your mom
answer the questions, all right?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.497
I didn't hear anything.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.132
I'm sorry.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.101
Where's your husband?

12:14.134 --> 12:15.268
Why?

12:15.302 --> 12:17.104
Maybe he heard or saw something.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.039
He-he didn't
hear anything.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.841
Okay. Here's what
we're gonna do.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.142
We'll speak to
your dad directly.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.310
Is that okay with you?

12:23.343 --> 12:26.079
Or maybe you
got something to hide.

12:26.113 --> 12:30.283
He... he works at
a bodega on 175th and Amsterdam.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.019
Great. We'll speak to him there.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.021
My father didn't
do anything wrong.

12:34.054 --> 12:34.988
Well, if he did
do something wrong,

12:35.022 --> 12:37.324
you better hope he's
a better liar than you.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.161
So what's the wrinkle?

12:41.194 --> 12:42.395
If you're saying
somebody has evidence

12:42.429 --> 12:44.097
that they were arrested
without probable cause,

12:44.131 --> 12:45.933
that's simply not the case.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.801
It's not that kind of wrinkle.
Then what?

12:47.835 --> 12:49.903
Well...

12:49.937 --> 12:52.039
It's coming in right now.

12:54.007 --> 12:58.178
Dad, this is Sabine Winston.
Her daughter Ariel is...

12:58.211 --> 12:59.913
One of the protestors
we arrested.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.049
Uh...

13:02.082 --> 13:03.050
may I sit down?

13:03.083 --> 13:05.518
Please.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.191
Thank you.

13:18.198 --> 13:21.034
I know you're a busy man,
Commissioner.

13:21.068 --> 13:23.170
So I'll get right to the point.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.873
Ariel made a huge mistake.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.374
But she's only 18.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.043
I'd hate her to have
a felony charge

13:30.077 --> 13:32.079
follow her around
for the rest of her life.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.047
Mrs. Winston,
as I'm sure

13:34.081 --> 13:35.883
my daughter has told you,

13:35.916 --> 13:38.318
reducing the charges
is not up to me,

13:38.351 --> 13:39.519
it's up to the
DA's office.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.922
And the DA's office--
no offense--

13:41.955 --> 13:44.892
is a political machine,
Commissioner.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.559
And you're one of
the few people allowed to

13:46.593 --> 13:49.529
put quarters in, and get
what you want in return.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.464
I can't have this conversation.

13:51.498 --> 13:56.136
Ariel is Mayor Poole's daughter.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.443
Ms. Winston came to me
in confidence

14:03.476 --> 14:04.511
after the arraignment.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.147
Carter and I...

14:07.180 --> 14:11.118
were both very young when
I got pregnant with Ariel.

14:11.151 --> 14:14.121
And Carter wanted to marry me.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.288
I'm the one who said no.

14:17.124 --> 14:18.558
I got married when
Ariel was a toddler,

14:18.591 --> 14:22.029
and she was raised with
my husband as her father.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.463
Ariel has no idea.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.301
And the mayor?

14:28.335 --> 14:32.305
He agreed to abide
by my wishes.

14:32.339 --> 14:35.642
Look, Carter has always
taken responsibility.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.911
Even paid Ariel's tuition.

14:37.945 --> 14:40.247
He has sacrificed a lot for her,

14:40.280 --> 14:43.350
in the sense that
this is a relationship

14:43.383 --> 14:44.551
he's had to live without.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.220
Did he ask you to talk to me?

14:47.254 --> 14:49.489
No, he... he wouldn't
want me here.

14:52.159 --> 14:55.328
A felony conviction will ruin
her chance to become a lawyer.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.299
Commissioner,
I am asking for mercy.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.136
Clearly, I haven't always
made the best choices.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.405
I wish that I had
done things differently.

15:05.438 --> 15:09.076
But Ariel is all I have.

15:13.546 --> 15:16.516
Ms. Winston...

15:16.549 --> 15:18.351
I can't undo what's done.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.392
You ever know him to
get involved with drugs

15:25.425 --> 15:26.426
or gangs, or anything?

15:26.459 --> 15:28.161
What, Fernando Ortiz?

15:28.195 --> 15:29.997
No, you got to be kidding me.
No. No way.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.698
Was he working yesterday?

15:31.731 --> 15:33.266
Why don't you ask him?
He should be back soon.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.501
Hey, we will ask him,
all right?

15:34.534 --> 15:35.768
But right now,
we're asking you questions.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.737
Unless you want to come down and
answer them at the station...

15:37.770 --> 15:39.306
No.

15:39.339 --> 15:40.607
Uh...

15:40.640 --> 15:43.143
Okay, he worked here last night.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.611
Uh, I paid him.

15:44.644 --> 15:47.214
He locked up at around 9:00,
and then he went home.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.381
You pay him in cash?

15:48.415 --> 15:50.183
Do I need a lawyer?

15:50.217 --> 15:52.185
Mr. Duran, listen.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.254
We're not here to
jam you or Fernando up, okay?

15:54.287 --> 15:55.188
We're not the I.N.S.

15:55.222 --> 15:57.057
We're not worried
about illegal workers,

15:57.090 --> 15:58.558
or whether you're
paying people in cash, okay?

15:58.591 --> 16:00.260
We're investigating a homicide.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.062
Whatever you tell us
about Fernando

16:02.095 --> 16:03.630
could clear him
of any wrongdoing.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.267
I paid him in cash.
Okay.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.102
How much did you
pay him in cash?

16:09.136 --> 16:11.071
$325.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.277
Mr. Ortiz.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.280
Is... is there something wrong?

16:20.313 --> 16:24.084
We need you to come
with us, sir. Okay?

16:24.117 --> 16:25.252
Let's go.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.287
Come on.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.701
We don't have enough
to arrest him, you know.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.703
Yeah. But he doesn't know that.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.772
In the meantime, we got enough
for a search warrant

16:45.805 --> 16:47.607
for his apartment, so...
What do you got?

16:47.640 --> 16:49.742
Well, ID came back
on our victim.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.078
It's a Phil Daelman.

16:51.111 --> 16:54.147
He's got priors for assault,
robbery and gun possession.
All right.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.416
So maybe this Phil Daelman
was up to his old tricks,

16:56.449 --> 16:58.418
but he picked on
the wrong guy this time.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.587
Let's see if this Mr. Ortiz
can enlighten us.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.622
Let's hope he doesn't
ask for a lawyer.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.660
He asked not to be disturbed.

17:07.694 --> 17:08.895
Too late.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.368
Garrett.
Forgotten, but not gone.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.604
I'm gonna ask
until I get an answer.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.806
What are we doing about
the protest arrests?
"We"?

17:19.839 --> 17:22.709
The Tim is accusing the police
department of overreacting.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.412
And the Post is commending them
for showing restraint.

17:27.447 --> 17:30.117
Let them duke it out.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.818
Okay, this demonstration
could've been a full-blown riot.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.121
But the arrests and
the quick police response

17:34.154 --> 17:35.255
actually prevented that.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.191
In front of the press,
in and out. Five minutes, tops.

17:39.226 --> 17:42.129
Well...

17:42.162 --> 17:43.730
there's a little more to it.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.798
There is?
Yep.

17:45.832 --> 17:46.799
What?

17:46.833 --> 17:48.801
Can you keep a secret?
Yes.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.604
Good. So can I.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.107
Come on.
(sighs)

17:54.807 --> 17:57.210
One of the students
who was arrested

17:57.244 --> 17:58.745
is Mayor Poole's daughter.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.849
And nobody knows that.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.321
That changes everything.

18:08.355 --> 18:09.656
Except the facts.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.224
What does he want you to do?

18:13.260 --> 18:15.228
He didn't ask for anything.

18:16.263 --> 18:17.830
And he doesn't know that I know.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.401
So we're going to do nothing?

18:21.434 --> 18:24.103
Now you're catching on.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.873
Your wife looked
pretty beat up.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.108
What happened to her?

18:30.777 --> 18:32.245
Okay, well, did you know that

18:32.279 --> 18:33.846
somebody got shot on
your block last night?

18:33.880 --> 18:36.849
No. I, uh, I didn't.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.918
You didn't hear any shots,
nothing?

18:38.951 --> 18:40.520
No.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.823
Do you recognize this guy?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.260
Sorry.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.261
Did you have

18:48.295 --> 18:50.497
any money on you when
you left work yesterday?

18:50.530 --> 18:51.831
No.

18:51.864 --> 18:52.899
No?

18:52.932 --> 18:55.935
What about the $325 in cash
your boss gave you?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.804
It...

18:57.837 --> 18:59.472
It must've fell
out of my pocket.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.208
Really? It must have
fallen out of your pocket?

19:01.241 --> 19:02.209
DANNY:
All right.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.843
Let's go over it again.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.745
You say your wife fell down

19:05.778 --> 19:06.846
and hit her face.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.915
Your take-home pay ends up

19:08.948 --> 19:09.982
in the hands of a dead man,

19:10.016 --> 19:11.884
who happened to be shot
right outside of your place,

19:11.918 --> 19:13.420
only moments after
neighbors heard screaming

19:13.453 --> 19:14.487
coming from inside.

19:14.521 --> 19:15.588
You really want us to believe

19:15.622 --> 19:16.856
you know nothing
about any of this?

19:16.889 --> 19:17.924
Look...

19:17.957 --> 19:20.827
all I know is,
I work my ass off.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.763
I follow the law,
and-and-and I don't hurt no one.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.832
Okay. Did someone hurt you?

19:27.867 --> 19:29.869
(sighs)

19:30.903 --> 19:33.673
How... h-how long
are you married?

19:35.708 --> 19:38.245
12 years. Why?

19:38.278 --> 19:40.713
I'm married 20.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.415
Marisol and I,
we've been together

19:42.449 --> 19:43.783
since we were 16 years old.

19:43.816 --> 19:46.819
Look, if someone broke into
your home, and started

19:46.853 --> 19:48.588
to beat your wife
right in front of you--

19:48.621 --> 19:50.890
right in front of your son--
what would you do?

19:50.923 --> 19:52.825
Is that what happened to you?

19:52.859 --> 19:55.462
Don't I have the right to defend
myself against people like him?

19:56.896 --> 19:58.965
They took everything we own.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.900
Everything we worked for.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.935
I ran after them.

20:05.272 --> 20:08.275
I just... I just wanted
to get it back.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.911
That's all.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.781
Just wanted to get it back.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.585
Well, you got a confession.
That's great.

20:18.618 --> 20:22.255
Yeah. Only I thought
I'd feel better about it.

20:22.289 --> 20:23.856
(indistinct shouting)

20:23.890 --> 20:24.957
REPORTER 1:
Commissioner! Commissioner.

20:24.991 --> 20:28.027
What about the fact that
the protestors were unarmed?

20:28.060 --> 20:31.030
FRANK:
Not unarmed, they just didn't
have conventional weapons.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.231
REPORTER 2:
Commissioner!

20:32.265 --> 20:34.767
Commissioner, the students
contend that they had a right

20:34.801 --> 20:36.603
to exercise their
First Amendment rights,

20:36.636 --> 20:39.339
and that those rights were
violated. How do you respond?

20:39.372 --> 20:40.573
The First Amendment
does guarantee

20:40.607 --> 20:43.376
the right to assemble...
peacefully.

20:43.410 --> 20:47.414
Law enforcement's responsibility
is to ensure public safety.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.616
My men did their job.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.050
REPORTER 1:
Commissioner, some might say

20:51.083 --> 20:52.619
that these were
just college students

20:52.652 --> 20:54.687
who were out
to protest tuition hikes.

20:54.721 --> 20:55.822
They weren't hurting anyone.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.358
Well, the officers
who were assaulted,

20:58.391 --> 21:00.827
and the pedestrians
and shopkeepers

21:00.860 --> 21:03.296
who were forced to
circumvent the crowd,

21:03.330 --> 21:04.864
might tell a different story.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.299
Have you talked to them?

21:06.333 --> 21:08.000
(reporters clamoring)

21:08.034 --> 21:09.569
That's all we have for today.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.638
We'll keep you updated
as things progress.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.440
My office is available
for any questions

21:13.473 --> 21:15.575
pertaining to...

21:17.844 --> 21:19.379
(sighs)

21:19.412 --> 21:21.548
The perps had fled,
the danger was gone.

21:21.581 --> 21:22.882
No, that is a gray area.

21:22.915 --> 21:25.685
No, it's pretty
black and white, Danny.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.087
He followed them outside.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.957
Yeah, after they invaded
his home and beat up his wife.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.659
But he didn't shoot
Daelman in his home.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.093
He shot him when
he was running away.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.628
Oh. Too bad he didn't

21:35.662 --> 21:37.464
drag Daelman's body
back into the apartment,

21:37.497 --> 21:39.532
'cause then he wouldn't be
facing any charges, would he?

21:39.566 --> 21:41.934
No, he'd be on the front page of
the Post under the word "hero."

21:41.968 --> 21:44.971
The law is very clear, Danny.
You can't shoot someone,

21:45.004 --> 21:47.974
unless you feel they're about
to use deadly physical force.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.843
They had a gun. They invaded his
home, they beat up his wife.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.946
How much more deadly can the
force get?
Was anyone pointing
a gun at him at the time? No.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.915
(whispering): Look, what else
was the guy supposed to do?

21:55.948 --> 21:59.051
Pick up the phone and call 911,
not run after him and shoot him.

21:59.085 --> 22:01.554
What if he had missed?

22:01.588 --> 22:03.756
What if he shot
an innocent bystander?

22:03.790 --> 22:05.124
He didn't miss, okay?
He hit the perp.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.360
Look, all I'm asking you to do
is cut the guy

22:07.394 --> 22:08.461
a break on the charges.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.430
Why, because you think
it's justified?

22:10.463 --> 22:13.032
No, because I think he was
a good man in a bad spot

22:13.065 --> 22:15.067
who was just trying
to protect his family.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.537
But that is for a jury
to decide, not you.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.639
The charge is manslaughter.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.007
(Danny sighs)

22:24.644 --> 22:28.615
Hi. I made brown
bread from scratch.

22:28.648 --> 22:29.916
Mom's recipe.

22:29.949 --> 22:32.385
She never wrote down
her recipes.

22:32.419 --> 22:34.053
I made it from memory.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.955
You want a slice?

22:37.990 --> 22:39.559
You set me up.

22:39.592 --> 22:44.063
You would never have come down
if you knew.

22:44.096 --> 22:47.166
And you needed to hear
what she had to say.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.001
Did I?

22:49.035 --> 22:51.938
Yes, you did, because you're
a man who needs the facts

22:51.971 --> 22:53.473
before he makes a decision.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.174
I had all the facts I needed,

22:55.207 --> 22:57.009
and the decision is not mine
to make

22:57.043 --> 22:58.110
as you well know.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.812
Are you gonna sit there
and tell me

22:59.846 --> 23:01.648
you'd rather be in the dark
about this?

23:07.053 --> 23:10.490
I'm not advocating special
treatment because of the mayor.

23:10.523 --> 23:12.124
Then what?

23:12.158 --> 23:13.593
I just thought that

23:13.626 --> 23:17.063
you should hear her side
of things because...

23:17.096 --> 23:19.065
Because you sympathize with her?

23:25.104 --> 23:28.207
Because I'm struggling
with the letter of the law

23:28.240 --> 23:31.544
versus the spirit of the law.

23:33.813 --> 23:36.983
One impulsive, dumb move

23:37.016 --> 23:39.819
and this girl has an asterisk
by her name

23:39.852 --> 23:42.555
for the rest of her life.

23:42.589 --> 23:47.059
It's the law, it's my job...

23:47.093 --> 23:50.429
Is it just?

23:52.999 --> 23:55.101
Not for me to say.

24:00.172 --> 24:02.475
How was your day with Nicky?

24:05.044 --> 24:07.680
She thinks defense attorneys are
the good guys.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.582
As in her dad?

24:09.616 --> 24:11.784
Well, implied.

24:13.152 --> 24:16.222
Imagine if she knew that
he didn't want joint custody.

24:20.192 --> 24:22.829
But you're not gonna tell her.

24:22.862 --> 24:25.598
No.

24:25.632 --> 24:28.167
That would only hurt her.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.902
(sighs)

24:29.936 --> 24:31.103
That's the hardest part,

24:31.137 --> 24:34.507
the things you do for them that
you can't tell 'em about.

24:37.276 --> 24:39.211
Something's missing.

24:39.245 --> 24:42.849
What?

24:42.882 --> 24:45.918
The thing that made
this taste good.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.229
Sit down.
I want you to take a look

24:57.263 --> 24:58.164
through these guys.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.266
You recognize anyone,
you give me a shout.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.201
I'll be at my desk,
all right?

25:02.234 --> 25:04.170
Why?

25:04.203 --> 25:06.773
Why what?
What difference is
this gonna make?

25:06.806 --> 25:08.107
Well, you want to find

25:08.140 --> 25:09.676
the guys who did this to your
family, don't you?

25:09.709 --> 25:11.778
Is it gonna save my dad
from going to jail?

25:11.811 --> 25:13.312
Probably not.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.214
I didn't think so.

25:15.247 --> 25:18.084
Look, kid,

25:18.117 --> 25:20.553
I'm sorry about your dad.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.989
Isn't there something
anyone can do?

25:23.022 --> 25:24.290
He's got to get a good lawyer.

25:24.323 --> 25:27.026
With what?
They took everything we have.

25:27.059 --> 25:28.761
Okay, well, maybe your dad
will get lucky

25:28.795 --> 25:30.897
and he'll get a jury
that'll sympathize with him.

25:30.930 --> 25:34.033
Oh, yeah?
How many people do you know

25:34.066 --> 25:35.267
sympathize
with illegal immigrants?

25:36.936 --> 25:39.906
Hey...

25:39.939 --> 25:41.841
Just take a look at the
pictures, all right?

25:44.276 --> 25:46.212
They found the gun in
the Ortiz apartment.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.581
Okay.
Sending it
to the lab now.

25:48.615 --> 25:51.250
This is him.
Who?

25:51.283 --> 25:53.285
This guy?

25:53.319 --> 25:54.386
Yeah.
Timothy Abbey.

25:54.420 --> 25:56.789
That's one of the guys
we don't have an address on.

25:56.823 --> 25:57.790
I'm gonna find it.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.692
You're sure
this is the guy?

25:59.726 --> 26:01.594
He slapped my mom around.

26:01.628 --> 26:03.095
I'll never forget that face.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.702
You can't go around
shooting people in the
middle of the street.

26:09.736 --> 26:11.738
Yeah, well, if somebody
comes into your home and
attacks your family,

26:11.771 --> 26:14.206
you should be able to.
To what, get revenge?

26:14.240 --> 26:15.474
To defend yourself
against intruders.

26:15.507 --> 26:18.911
That.
Yeah, but he didn't kill
anybody. He robbed someone.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.847
And he doesn't deserve
to die for that.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.616
Says who?
Once they left,
the danger was over.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.918
Oh, you're gonna join
the conversation now,
Harvard, is that it?

26:25.952 --> 26:28.688
Wait, wait.
Jamie, let me ask you this.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.623
If someone came in here
right now with guns

26:30.657 --> 26:32.659
and started hitting the kids
and taking our valuables,

26:32.692 --> 26:34.761
you would feel the same.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.629
If they're already gone,
it's revenge.

26:36.663 --> 26:40.266
Dad, do you think a bad guy's
gonna come in here?

26:40.299 --> 26:42.669
Are you kidding?
He'd take one look

26:42.702 --> 26:44.671
at this table
and run the other way.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.205
This place is, like, Cop City.

26:46.238 --> 26:47.740
Plus a prosecutor.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.742
Boy, did they choose
the wrong house.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.410
It's revenge, plain and simple.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.913
But it's not plain
and simple.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.749
Well, the punishment has
to fit the crime

26:56.783 --> 26:59.118
and the circumstances, not
just in the penal code.

26:59.151 --> 27:01.220
So what do you charge him with?

27:01.253 --> 27:03.856
It's not like he planned
it; it was a spur-of-
the-moment thing.

27:03.890 --> 27:06.425
And the law accounts for
that; a reaction in the
heat of the moment.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.860
Yeah, but it wasn't
in the moment.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.128
He had to go to a drawer,

27:09.161 --> 27:10.930
get a gun and then
chase after them.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.965
Oh, come on. We're not talking
about a criminal here.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.400
We're talking
about a... a hardworking man

27:14.433 --> 27:16.368
whose family was attacked,

27:16.402 --> 27:17.336
and he-he stood up
for them.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.238
We should all be
able to do that.

27:19.271 --> 27:20.372
No, we shouldn't.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.374
What Ortiz lost was replaceable.

27:22.408 --> 27:24.376
What Daelman lost is not.

27:24.410 --> 27:25.244
Well, given the circumstances,

27:25.277 --> 27:27.379
I'd make the same
choice Ortiz did.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.415
Run after them
and shoot? No. Mm-mmm.

27:29.448 --> 27:30.683
Neither would I.

27:30.717 --> 27:32.251
Well, I would.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.286
I think
Uncle Danny's right.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.088
Well, of course you do.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.423
What's that supposed to mean?

27:37.456 --> 27:38.557
It means there's nothing

27:38.590 --> 27:41.327
I could possibly say or do
that you would agree with.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.429
Maybe if you weren't
prosecuting students

27:43.462 --> 27:44.363
and people who get robbed.

27:44.396 --> 27:47.166
I'm prosecuting people
who've broken the law,

27:47.199 --> 27:49.401
and since when do you
not relate to that?

27:49.435 --> 27:53.105
You're just mad I agreed with
that defense attorney.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.407
Why would I be mad
about that?

27:55.441 --> 27:57.443
Because you hate them,
because my father's one.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.820
Next time, go to work with Dad.

28:12.892 --> 28:15.795
Who wants another pork chop?

28:15.828 --> 28:17.229
Hey.
Hey.
I didn't want

28:17.263 --> 28:18.597
to cut your Sunday
night dinner short,

28:18.630 --> 28:21.433
but one of Abbey's
cohorts says he works
in here on the weekends.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.369
Oh, believe me, if Sunday dinner
went on any longer,

28:23.402 --> 28:25.237
it would have turned
into a crime scene.

28:25.271 --> 28:27.239
You guys get together
every week to eat and fight.

28:27.273 --> 28:28.507
You sure you're not Italian?

28:28.540 --> 28:31.210
No, Irish.
We just drink a little more.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.845
There he is.

28:32.879 --> 28:35.047
Timothy Abbey!

28:37.316 --> 28:38.450
(bystanders screaming)

28:38.484 --> 28:39.718
Hey!

28:42.421 --> 28:44.423
Hey! What are you doing?!

28:46.425 --> 28:48.060
Hold it!

28:50.096 --> 28:51.430
Hey!

28:51.463 --> 28:52.731
Hold it!

28:55.501 --> 28:57.403
(Abbey gasping)

28:57.436 --> 28:59.471
Come here!
Ow!

28:59.505 --> 29:01.340
You know this man,
tough guy?

29:01.373 --> 29:02.174
No.

29:02.208 --> 29:05.311
Don't lie to me.
You robbed his family.

29:05.344 --> 29:06.545
It wasn't me.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.815
Who was it, then?
It was this guy?

29:09.949 --> 29:11.450
Yeah.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.352
Yeah? How do you know that
if you weren't with him?

29:13.385 --> 29:15.521
I might've been with him,
but I didn't do nothing.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.556
Really? We got witnesses
that say otherwise.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.792
Who's your witness?

29:19.826 --> 29:21.928
Some guy who's
not even a citizen?

29:21.961 --> 29:24.130
I was born in this country.
I have rights.

29:24.163 --> 29:26.232
Is that why you targeted
Mr. Ortiz, huh?

29:26.265 --> 29:27.299
Because he's illegal?

29:27.333 --> 29:28.901
Is that it?

29:28.935 --> 29:30.837
It was all Phil.

29:30.870 --> 29:34.073
He called it "papi hunting."

29:34.106 --> 29:36.175
What the hell is papi hunting?

29:36.208 --> 29:38.244
Phil said if we could find
some wetbacks

29:38.277 --> 29:40.813
walking around with cash...

29:40.847 --> 29:42.014
Those people don't go to banks.

29:42.048 --> 29:44.416
And they don't go to police,
either. That's what he said.

29:44.450 --> 29:46.452
Really?
Yeah, a win-win.

29:46.485 --> 29:48.087
Is that what it is?

29:48.120 --> 29:50.456
Yeah.
Imagine that.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.458
You think that's funny, huh?

29:52.491 --> 29:55.227
That what you call it?
A win-win?
What's the matter?
Danny!

29:55.261 --> 29:57.363
What's the matter with you,
okay?! They shot my friend!

29:57.396 --> 29:59.198
They were the ones who shot
my friend, okay?!

29:59.231 --> 30:00.867
I am the... I'm the victim here!

30:00.900 --> 30:02.234
You're the victim?
Yes!

30:02.268 --> 30:04.203
Well, I don't know too many
victims who carry guns

30:04.236 --> 30:05.972
and break into innocent
people's houses, do you?

30:06.005 --> 30:08.607
I don't know.
Why don't you just ask the kid

30:08.640 --> 30:09.909
who killed my friend?

30:09.942 --> 30:12.144
What do you mean,
the kid?

30:12.178 --> 30:14.546
What do you mean, the kid
who killed your friend?

30:14.580 --> 30:17.149
That guy's son.

30:17.183 --> 30:21.854
He's the one who ran after us
and shot Phil, okay?

30:31.163 --> 30:32.598
Will you release my dad
if I tell you everything?

30:32.631 --> 30:35.134
Hey, hey, you're not in any
position to make demands here,

30:35.167 --> 30:37.536
kid, all right?
I've done nothing but
try to help your dad.

30:37.569 --> 30:38.770
You want to help your dad?

30:38.804 --> 30:42.074
I suggest you stop giving me
the runaround and start talking.

30:46.145 --> 30:48.981
They came into my house
with a gun.

30:49.015 --> 30:52.885
We were scared
to death.

30:52.919 --> 30:55.922
(voice breaks): I really thought
they were gonna shoot us.

30:55.955 --> 30:59.625
That's why when they left,

30:59.658 --> 31:03.963
I ran after them
with my father's gun.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.432
I was the one

31:06.465 --> 31:08.901
who shot at them, not my dad.

31:22.148 --> 31:25.117
Why did your dad
confess to it?

31:25.151 --> 31:28.955
He was just trying
to protect me.

31:28.988 --> 31:31.090
He didn't want me to go to jail.

31:34.093 --> 31:36.562
I didn't mean to kill him.

31:40.166 --> 31:41.500
I was just mad...

31:45.104 --> 31:47.073
And I was afraid.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.377
I was afraid they'd come back.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.018
I'm sorry.

32:00.352 --> 32:04.123
All right... all right.

32:05.724 --> 32:09.295
This is what
I want you to do.

32:09.328 --> 32:10.629
I want you to write down

32:10.662 --> 32:12.198
everything you just told me,
okay?

32:12.231 --> 32:14.233
Just write it.

32:18.504 --> 32:21.740
Make sure you write down
the part about you thinking

32:21.773 --> 32:23.542
they were gonna come back.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.211
Go on. Write it down.

32:25.244 --> 32:28.380
Write it,
write it down.

32:28.414 --> 32:30.349
You were afraid
they were gonna come back.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.650
You were afraid for your life,
okay?

32:31.683 --> 32:33.052
Make sure you write that, too.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.156
(sighs)

32:42.228 --> 32:44.230
I can't be late for school.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.265
We're okay.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.634
It's just... I have a
thing about being late.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.669
You got that from me.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.405
Look, if we have to put
on the lights and sirens,

32:53.439 --> 32:55.974
we'll do it, okay?

32:59.178 --> 33:01.047
Have some toast.

33:09.388 --> 33:10.789
How'd your report go?

33:10.822 --> 33:12.191
I got an A.

33:12.224 --> 33:13.259
Good.

33:13.292 --> 33:16.262
Must have been nice to spend
the day with your mom.

33:16.295 --> 33:18.230
See how she works.

33:18.264 --> 33:20.432
See how bossy she can be.

33:20.466 --> 33:22.734
Moms are supposed to be bossy.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.505
What are dads supposed to be?

33:29.641 --> 33:31.377
I don't know.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.812
Show up once in a while
might be nice.

33:33.845 --> 33:37.183
Pretend, at least,
to be interested.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.323
I called him, you know.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.491
I asked him

33:45.524 --> 33:47.326
if he would take me
to work with him.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.260
What did he say?

33:48.294 --> 33:50.462
He said he was too busy,
and he would call

33:50.496 --> 33:52.564
when things quieted down,
and we could go to lunch then.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.268
I see.

33:56.302 --> 33:59.238
But we're not gonna
have lunch, Grandpa.

33:59.271 --> 34:01.740
Because things
never quiet down enough

34:01.773 --> 34:03.809
for him to have time for me.

34:03.842 --> 34:06.078
That's got to sting.

34:06.112 --> 34:07.779
I'm used to it.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.381
But

34:09.415 --> 34:11.717
that's just between us,
that I called him, okay?

34:11.750 --> 34:13.419
Okay.

34:13.452 --> 34:15.287
Mom would probably try
and fix that, too.

34:15.321 --> 34:16.588
Well,

34:16.622 --> 34:18.624
that's another job requirement
for mothers,

34:18.657 --> 34:20.426
be bossy and fix things.

34:20.459 --> 34:24.330
Yeah, well, some things
can't be fixed.

34:24.363 --> 34:25.464
Nicky,

34:25.497 --> 34:27.599
if I'm hearing you correctly,

34:27.633 --> 34:29.868
it seems like
you're saying your mom

34:29.901 --> 34:31.537
pretty much has
to do everything.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.872
She doesn't have
to do everything.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.074
No? Who's her backup?

34:39.278 --> 34:41.313
And she doesn't

34:41.347 --> 34:44.183
have to do everything for you,

34:44.216 --> 34:46.285
she wants to do everything.

34:50.189 --> 34:52.291
You want me
to cut her some slack?

34:54.793 --> 34:57.429
Your mom's not the only one
who likes to fix things.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.337
It's horrible, isn't it?

35:05.371 --> 35:06.538
Your mom made it.

35:07.573 --> 35:09.741
Here you go.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.510
The kid's statement.

35:11.543 --> 35:14.246
And were you able to corroborate
his version of events,

35:14.280 --> 35:16.748
since there seems to be no end
to the number of people

35:16.782 --> 35:18.517
confessing to this murder?

35:18.550 --> 35:20.452
Ballistics and fingerprints
analysis are consistent

35:20.486 --> 35:23.355
with his statement,
so I'll start to process him.

35:23.389 --> 35:25.891
There you go.
"I was in fear for my life."

35:25.924 --> 35:27.926
Yeah, that's what he said.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.829
"He turned to confront me."

35:30.862 --> 35:33.265
You coached him.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.467
I did not coach him;
those are his words.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.369
Look, I might have helped him
with his English

35:37.403 --> 35:39.205
a little bit,
that's about it.

35:39.238 --> 35:40.272
And he asked for a lawyer?

35:40.306 --> 35:41.540
Yeah, he asked for a lawyer

35:41.573 --> 35:43.575
right after I took
the statement.

35:46.878 --> 35:48.814
You know what's
interesting, though,

35:48.847 --> 35:51.450
is that, somehow,
his family was able

35:51.483 --> 35:52.951
to retain the services

35:52.984 --> 35:55.821
of the white-shoe law firm
of Pierce, Freeman & Hamill.

35:55.854 --> 35:56.888
Hm.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.290
Imagine that.

35:58.324 --> 35:59.225
This immigrant family,

35:59.258 --> 36:02.528
no money,
father works at a corner bodega.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.563
Wonder how they pulled that off.

36:04.596 --> 36:06.832
Well, they do handle pro bono.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.534
Oh.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.602
You know, I seem
to remember you telling me

36:10.636 --> 36:13.472
that you had a very close friend
who worked for the law firm

36:13.505 --> 36:14.906
of Pierce, Freeman & Hamill.

36:18.344 --> 36:20.912
Well, I do like a
formidable opponent in court.

36:28.387 --> 36:29.955
Come on in, Frank.

36:35.927 --> 36:37.596
Can I get you something?

36:37.629 --> 36:39.598
No, thanks, I'm fine.
Listen,

36:39.631 --> 36:41.833
did you see this op-ed piece
in the Times

36:41.867 --> 36:43.502
about the
Hudson University protest?

36:43.535 --> 36:46.238
No, I haven't,
but I was just talking

36:46.272 --> 36:48.374
to the District
Attorney about that.

36:48.407 --> 36:50.609
Is that right?
What did he have to say?

36:50.642 --> 36:52.878
Well, he feels it's important
the DA's office

36:52.911 --> 36:55.481
be seen as standing
alongside my department

36:55.514 --> 36:57.483
on lawful arrests.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.985
And, of course,
it's important for me

37:00.018 --> 37:02.020
to stand up for my people.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.323
Well, of course.
But he did make a case

37:04.356 --> 37:06.725
for being sensitive
to the future

37:06.758 --> 37:08.894
of these young people.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.996
My daughter, Erin, told me,
for instance,

37:11.029 --> 37:14.666
that, uh, one of the arrested,

37:14.700 --> 37:16.535
Ariel Winston,

37:16.568 --> 37:18.570
wants to be a lawyer.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.644
Anyway...

37:28.747 --> 37:30.649
He feels he has some

37:30.682 --> 37:34.019
latitude, so he's recommending

37:34.052 --> 37:37.389
that the charges be reduced
to a misdemeanor.

37:39.425 --> 37:40.592
And where do you stand?

37:40.626 --> 37:43.529
Well, you know me, I'm pretty
much a law and order guy.

37:43.562 --> 37:44.996
Hmm.

37:45.030 --> 37:48.066
But in this case,

37:48.099 --> 37:51.503
I think it serves
the spirit of the law.

37:51.537 --> 37:52.838
Right.

37:52.871 --> 37:55.407
But the decision reflects
on you as well, sir.

37:56.442 --> 37:57.609
What do you think?

37:57.643 --> 38:00.612
Well, Frank, I like
to think that everyone

38:00.646 --> 38:03.048
deserves a break
every now and then.

38:03.081 --> 38:05.717
Okay, then.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.986
But they are not
getting off scot-free.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.721
They're gonna do a year's
community service

38:09.755 --> 38:10.989
at the Dutton Center downtown.

38:11.022 --> 38:13.024
Dutton, huh?

38:13.058 --> 38:15.927
I practically grew up there.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.564
My mom worked full-time,
my dad was out of the picture.

38:18.597 --> 38:19.831
I went by there every day
after school.

38:19.865 --> 38:22.834
Did you ever get back
in touch with him?

38:22.868 --> 38:25.504
Nah, I never knew him.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.639
Not much to get back
in touch about.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.678
Anyway...

38:34.546 --> 38:36.815
I just wanted to stop by
and give you the news.

38:36.848 --> 38:38.550
I appreciate that, Frank.

38:38.584 --> 38:40.619
Especially when all
you had to do was call.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.422
Good day, Mr. Mayor.

38:43.455 --> 38:44.590
Always a pleasure, Frank.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.502
POOLE:
Guys, give me a second, okay?

38:56.535 --> 38:58.537
Just about a minute.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.046
Hello.

39:10.048 --> 39:11.950
Do you know who I am?

39:11.983 --> 39:16.388
Yes, you're the mayor
of New York City.

39:18.424 --> 39:20.426
That's right.

39:22.661 --> 39:24.596
I'm Ariel Winston.

39:24.630 --> 39:27.599
Very nice to meet you, Ariel.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.737
And I'm here to clean
up your fair city.

39:31.770 --> 39:32.671
(laughs)

39:32.704 --> 39:35.106
Yes, and I can use
all the help I can get.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.442
Thank you.

39:37.643 --> 39:38.710
I'm glad to hear

39:38.744 --> 39:41.413
you were able to make a deal
with the DA's office.

39:41.447 --> 39:44.616
Maybe this will remind you
to think, take a breath,

39:44.650 --> 39:45.784
next time you make a decision

39:45.817 --> 39:48.587
that might affect
the rest of your life.

39:48.620 --> 39:49.755
I will.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.623
Good.

39:53.659 --> 39:57.095
This paint just
will not come off.

39:57.128 --> 39:59.531
Tried everything.

39:59.565 --> 40:04.202
That's because you got to put
a little more elbow into it.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.871
Let me, um, see that.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.205
Yeah, that's good.

40:07.238 --> 40:10.041
Spray right here.

40:13.579 --> 40:15.447
(grunts)

40:17.583 --> 40:19.851
FRANK:
I know what you're thinking.

40:19.885 --> 40:21.653
Oh, you do?

40:21.687 --> 40:22.888
Yeah.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.590
I'm your father.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.592
Okay, what am I thinking?

40:26.625 --> 40:28.760
You're wondering if you'll
ever do anything right

40:28.794 --> 40:30.195
in Nicky's eyes.

40:30.228 --> 40:32.731
You're good.

40:32.764 --> 40:35.467
Well, teenagers consider it

40:35.501 --> 40:37.469
their job to torture
their parents.

40:37.503 --> 40:40.071
I didn't torture
you, did I?

40:40.105 --> 40:42.708
Well, more so your mom.

40:42.741 --> 40:46.812
But I'm glad I wasn't
a single parent back then.

40:46.845 --> 40:50.148
I don't think I could have
handled it without your mother.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.621
I only remember the good times.

40:55.654 --> 40:57.589
Movie night,

40:57.623 --> 41:00.225
or the road trips you guys used
to take us on in the summer.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.494
You loved Cape Cod.

41:02.528 --> 41:04.229
Yeah, but I didn't love
being sandwiched

41:04.262 --> 41:05.664
between Joe and Danny.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.599
Well, it was
character building.

41:09.901 --> 41:13.572
You and mom made it
look so easy.

41:13.605 --> 41:15.741
It was easier for us.

41:15.774 --> 41:19.545
I didn't have to explain
why your mother wasn't around.

41:23.882 --> 41:26.217
Yeah, I guess I was lucky.

41:27.252 --> 41:30.756
She called her dad first.

41:32.057 --> 41:34.526
And he blew her off.

41:37.228 --> 41:40.566
That's why she's been upset.

41:40.599 --> 41:43.602
And you didn't hear
that from me.

41:47.172 --> 41:49.708
What am I supposed
to do about that?

41:49.741 --> 41:52.544
You know, some things
can't be fixed.

41:52.578 --> 41:55.781
And the hardest thing for
a parent to do sometimes

41:55.814 --> 41:58.249
is nothing.

42:00.752 --> 42:04.756
"Sometimes I think I may
want to be a lawyer

42:04.790 --> 42:08.760
"because I realize
that I love justice

42:08.794 --> 42:12.731
"and if that's the career
that I decide to build,

42:12.764 --> 42:15.834
"I want to be the
kind of lawyer

42:15.867 --> 42:17.669
"my mother is.

42:18.837 --> 42:21.673
"Tough but fair

42:21.707 --> 42:23.842
"and just

42:23.875 --> 42:25.744
"and able to stand
up to pressures

42:25.777 --> 42:27.946
"on both sides
of the bench.

42:27.979 --> 42:30.782
"Spending a day
walking in her shoes

42:30.816 --> 42:34.152
"has made me
appreciate
both her

42:34.185 --> 42:37.188
and the job she does."

42:48.133 --> 42:51.703
She rarely lets me read
these reports anymore.

42:51.737 --> 42:53.204
I'm special.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.175
Yes, you are.
