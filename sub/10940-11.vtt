WEBVTT

00:00.514 --> 00:02.095
<i>Previously on "Heartland"...</i>

00:02.266 --> 00:03.290
A school uniform?

00:03.400 --> 00:04.892
Blessed Virgin Academy.

00:04.902 --> 00:06.810
They're sending me
to boarding school.

00:06.904 --> 00:07.893
Cherie?

00:08.038 --> 00:09.130
Yeah, she's a lawyer in town.

00:09.239 --> 00:10.638
Lou.

00:11.875 --> 00:13.934
- Amy didn't tell you?
- Tell me what?

00:14.044 --> 00:15.033
It's Apollo.

00:15.145 --> 00:15.907
I love this hat.

00:16.013 --> 00:17.947
Come on.
It's fit for the garbage.

00:18.148 --> 00:20.514
Me and this hat have been
through a lot together.

00:20.617 --> 00:21.641
Ty and Kit are happy.

00:21.752 --> 00:23.947
And I know you need some time
to get used to it, but they are.

00:24.121 --> 00:25.452
You know what I think?

00:25.622 --> 00:27.681
I think he gave up on you
pretty easy.

Milady.

00:46.376 --> 00:47.900
Oh!

00:49.213 --> 00:50.271
Okay. Okay, stop.

00:50.380 --> 00:52.507
You're making me dizzy.

00:52.616 --> 00:54.743
Gonna make me puke.

00:55.686 --> 00:57.779
I would die for a belt like that.

00:57.888 --> 01:00.550
Me too. But don't get your hopes up.
Check the price.

01:00.657 --> 01:02.454
- A thousand dollars?
- Yeah.

01:02.559 --> 01:04.925
Even with the store discount,
I could never afford it.

01:05.028 --> 01:06.825
Amy, you ready to go?

01:06.930 --> 01:07.988
Yeah.

01:08.098 --> 01:09.429
And that fancy belt?

01:09.533 --> 01:11.228
First big rodeo payout, it's yours.

01:11.335 --> 01:13.326
What, you think
you can just buy me?

01:14.238 --> 01:16.934
Well, my natural charm
coupled with a big wad of cash.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.302
May not buy you outright,

01:18.408 --> 01:19.875
but I could sure make
a down payment.

01:19.977 --> 01:22.070
You never quit, do you?

01:22.179 --> 01:24.272
No, I don't.

01:25.916 --> 01:27.907
See you.

01:30.053 --> 01:33.352
The reservation
is under what name?

01:34.758 --> 01:37.056
Excuse me?

01:38.562 --> 01:40.723
Yes, of course.

01:41.365 --> 01:44.163
No. No problem at all.

01:44.268 --> 01:46.759
Okay. Yep.

01:46.870 --> 01:49.270
Bye-bye.

01:54.344 --> 01:55.436
What's wrong, Lou?

01:55.546 --> 01:57.343
Oh, my God, Grandpa,
you are not gonna believe it.

01:57.447 --> 02:00.041
That was a friend of Lauren's
who's a big agent in L.A.,

02:00.150 --> 02:01.981
and he represents
all the A-list stars.

02:04.087 --> 02:06.612
I can't tell you.

02:09.226 --> 02:11.285
Riding lessons?
I'm not a riding instructor.

02:11.395 --> 02:13.192
Listen, her agent says
she's really good.

02:13.297 --> 02:15.390
All she needs is a little tune-up.

02:16.533 --> 02:19.468
- Her agent?
- Yeah. Her travel agent.

02:19.570 --> 02:22.971
Look, Amy, I'm prepared to pay.
Name your price.

02:23.073 --> 02:25.906
I'm not gonna take your money, Lou.

02:26.009 --> 02:27.636
There must be something you want.

02:29.846 --> 02:33.907
Well, actually there was
this B.B. Simon belt in Maggie's.

02:34.017 --> 02:37.145
B.B. Simon?
Those things cost a fortune.

02:37.254 --> 02:39.279
But you know what?
You want it, you got it.

02:40.090 --> 02:41.990
- Are you serious?
- You bet I am.

02:42.092 --> 02:45.823
So, Amy, if this works out,
this could change our lives.

02:45.929 --> 02:48.329
In a good way.
Do we have a deal?

02:49.333 --> 02:53.030
So who is this person
who's gonna change my life?

02:54.037 --> 02:54.969
What's this?

02:55.072 --> 02:57.438
A confidentiality agreement.

02:57.541 --> 02:59.771
What is it I'm keeping confidential?

02:59.876 --> 03:01.901
I don't think
it's a "what" question, Grandpa.

03:02.012 --> 03:04.810
I think it's a "who" question.

03:15.125 --> 03:17.218
Excuse me.

03:18.028 --> 03:22.124
I need a pair of cowboy boots.

03:23.567 --> 03:26.968
Wow. I absolutely need that belt, too.

03:28.605 --> 03:30.300
Oh, my God.

03:30.941 --> 03:32.033
You're...

03:32.142 --> 03:33.734
Mindy Fanshaw.

03:33.844 --> 03:36.244
Who is Mindy Fanshaw?

03:36.346 --> 03:38.644
- Mindy Fanshaw?
- I saw one of her movies once.

03:38.749 --> 03:41.513
- Oh, man, she's hot.
- I can't wait to tell Soraya.

03:41.618 --> 03:45.884
Yeah, that's the thing.
Nobody is telling anybody anything.

03:45.989 --> 03:48.981
Where am I supposed to get
pure Egyptian cotton sheets?

03:49.092 --> 03:51.026
10 cases of Fiji Water?

03:51.128 --> 03:52.857
What's wrong with our own water?

03:52.963 --> 03:54.055
Well, yeah.

03:54.164 --> 03:56.826
Organic flaxseed snack bars?
Kumquats?

03:56.933 --> 04:00.596
15 strawberry incense sticks.
One box of bendy straws.

04:00.704 --> 04:02.899
Yeah. And we need white candles.

04:03.006 --> 04:05.839
Where do we keep the white candles
in this house?

04:05.942 --> 04:06.704
Ah. Bingo.

04:06.810 --> 04:08.539
Lou, those are for emergencies.

04:08.645 --> 04:10.237
What do you think this is?

04:10.347 --> 04:12.941
I need a dozen
spaced around each room

04:13.050 --> 04:14.847
to ward off bad vibes.

04:16.486 --> 04:17.111
Okay.

04:17.220 --> 04:18.050
Oh, and Grandpa?

04:18.154 --> 04:20.248
You need to replace
the toilet seat in the outhouse.

04:20.357 --> 04:23.019
What's wrong with the old one?
It's barely been sat on.

04:23.126 --> 04:25.651
Yeah. But it has been sat on.
And that's the problem.

04:25.762 --> 04:28.060
I'm thinking
the fact that the toilet seat

04:28.165 --> 04:30.030
is perched
over a hole in the ground

04:30.133 --> 04:32.363
might be more the problem
for that little girl.

04:32.469 --> 04:35.802
You guys, I know this is ridiculous
and that obviously Mindy Fanshaw

04:35.906 --> 04:39.307
is a self-centered, obnoxious,
narcissistic sociopath

04:39.409 --> 04:42.173
who thinks the world revolves...

04:45.716 --> 04:46.705
You must be Lou.

04:47.617 --> 04:48.606

05:38.668 --> 05:41.193
So, then my agent called me back,

05:41.304 --> 05:43.329
and he said, "Guess what?

05:43.440 --> 05:45.874
You're going to cowboy camp."

05:45.976 --> 05:47.273
I love this.

05:47.377 --> 05:49.140
God, It was so last-minute, you know?

05:49.246 --> 05:50.713
They stuck me
on a commercial flight.

05:50.814 --> 05:51.906
Oh, what a nightmare.

05:52.015 --> 05:52.811
I know.

05:52.916 --> 05:54.816
Then some awful paparazzi

05:54.918 --> 05:56.545
snuck in the VIP lounge.

05:56.653 --> 05:58.621
Well, listen, speaking of last minute,

05:58.722 --> 05:59.711
I didn't have time

05:59.823 --> 06:01.290
to get the Egyptian cotton.

06:01.391 --> 06:03.586
But I can absolutely guarantee

06:03.693 --> 06:04.785
these sheets have never been

06:04.895 --> 06:05.987
touched by another human.

06:08.365 --> 06:09.423
Oh, my God. Mallory.

06:09.533 --> 06:11.364
Oh, my God.
Mindy Fanshaw.

06:11.468 --> 06:15.700
Oh, my God! Somebody get
this person out of my room!

06:15.872 --> 06:16.736
So, your little girl

06:16.840 --> 06:18.273
is safe and sound.

06:18.375 --> 06:20.138
Give me a call when you get this.

06:20.243 --> 06:25.146
Okay. I talked to a Sister Gabrielle
at your school.

06:25.248 --> 06:28.046
And I left a message
with your mom and dad.

06:28.151 --> 06:31.416
Why don't you tell me
what is going on?

06:31.521 --> 06:33.148
First things first.

06:33.890 --> 06:35.858
You need to sign this.

06:42.532 --> 06:45.194
Hey, not that one.
The good one.

06:45.302 --> 06:46.667
Well, that's Amy's saddle.

06:46.770 --> 06:49.432
Yeah? We're talking
about Mindy Fanshaw's butt.

06:49.539 --> 06:50.870
Yeah, and if Mindy wants a ride,

06:50.974 --> 06:52.498
she can tack up
her own damn horse

06:52.609 --> 06:53.803
just like everyone else.

06:53.910 --> 06:57.209
So, which one of you cowboys
is gonna saddle up my horse for me?

06:57.314 --> 07:00.147
Butch or Sundance?

07:00.250 --> 07:03.845
Actually, Mindy, that's not the way
we do things here.

07:08.758 --> 07:10.225
Wow, it's hard-core.

07:10.327 --> 07:12.261
Okay, celebrity boot camp.

07:12.362 --> 07:13.522
I can take it.

07:13.630 --> 07:14.756
All right.

07:15.665 --> 07:16.859
You don't understand.

07:16.967 --> 07:19.561
A major Hollywood celebrity
is riding my horse.

07:19.669 --> 07:21.398
This is huge.

07:22.239 --> 07:23.934
You hold on.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.372
You still haven't told me
what the heck you're doing here.

07:26.476 --> 07:29.206
Have you ever been
to an all-girls boarding school?

07:29.312 --> 07:31.610
Do I really have to answer that?

07:31.715 --> 07:33.478
Pizza Thursdays?
Frozen.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.141
Discipline?
Lights out at 9:00.

07:35.252 --> 07:37.117
And even you've heard
of high-speed.

07:37.220 --> 07:41.384
So how did you manage to pull off
this great escape all by yourself?

07:41.491 --> 07:43.925
I used the old
pillow-under-the-sheet trick.

07:44.094 --> 07:46.995
Climbed over the wall.
Took a taxi to the bus station.

07:47.097 --> 07:48.724
Took the 11:30 to Hudson.

07:48.832 --> 07:49.856
Okay.

07:49.966 --> 07:51.934
Well, there's still
a 20-mile discrepancy

07:52.035 --> 07:54.833
between the end of your story
and your arrival here.

07:54.938 --> 07:56.633
You know
that confidentiality agreement

07:56.740 --> 07:58.037
Lou's been making everyone sign?

07:58.174 --> 07:59.163
Uh-huh.

07:59.276 --> 08:02.040
Yeah, it's kind of like that.

08:03.613 --> 08:05.274
Hey!

08:09.319 --> 08:11.082
All right.

08:11.187 --> 08:12.950
Don't worry.
I got your horse here.

08:13.056 --> 08:14.489
Here. I'll give you a leg up.

08:15.959 --> 08:17.358
Whoa!

08:17.460 --> 08:18.950
Ahh!

08:19.396 --> 08:22.456
You know, Mindy, I've seen
pretty much all your movies.

08:22.566 --> 08:24.158
Yeah? Even the bad ones?

08:24.267 --> 08:26.258
Especially the bad ones.

08:26.369 --> 08:27.893
Okay, well,
I'm ready to ride the range.

08:28.004 --> 08:28.902
Wait.

08:29.005 --> 08:30.472
I need a picture, okay?
Take a picture.

08:30.574 --> 08:31.302
No, Mallory.

08:31.474 --> 08:33.601
You have no idea
how often this happens to me.

08:33.710 --> 08:34.972
Sweetie, if you want a picture,

08:35.111 --> 08:37.238
you can download one
from my fan site.

08:37.380 --> 08:39.405
You don't understand.
You're actually riding my horse.

08:39.515 --> 08:40.505
If you're incapable

08:40.616 --> 08:42.140
of respecting my rights
as a famous person,

08:42.251 --> 08:43.913
then I don't think you can
call yourself a fan at all.

08:44.020 --> 08:45.920
Go on, now.

08:47.357 --> 08:49.291
Okay. Where were we?

08:49.392 --> 08:51.383
All right, well,
just collect your reins.

08:53.730 --> 08:55.254
No, no, no, no.
Not that much.

08:55.432 --> 08:56.626
Don't move.

08:56.733 --> 08:57.825
There you go.

08:57.934 --> 08:59.834
Keep your hands low,
together on his neck.

08:59.936 --> 09:01.233
And you just want to kick him up.

09:02.205 --> 09:03.502
No! Not that much!
Not that much!

09:03.607 --> 09:05.268
He's not listening to me!

09:05.408 --> 09:08.434
Wow, Ty. She's almost as bad
as when you first started.

09:08.578 --> 09:09.169
Hey.

09:09.279 --> 09:10.678
No, I think she's worse.

09:12.749 --> 09:13.807
Damn.

09:13.917 --> 09:15.214
Mindy Fanshaw.

09:15.318 --> 09:19.049
She might not know how to ride,
but she sure looks good trying.

09:19.189 --> 09:20.986
Yeah, she sure does.

09:21.858 --> 09:24.326
Guys!

09:26.096 --> 09:27.586
Whoa!

09:28.732 --> 09:32.361
Okay. That was awesome.

09:32.469 --> 09:34.630
You're an amazing instructor.
Really.

09:34.738 --> 09:37.536
I mean, I'm gonna be a cowgirl
in, like, a week.

09:37.641 --> 09:39.302
I don't know about that.

09:39.409 --> 09:42.606
See, the thing is, I'm not really
a real riding instructor.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.680
Yeah, and I'm not really a teenager.

09:44.781 --> 09:47.944
But all the scripts they send me
are for these stupid teen movies.

09:48.051 --> 09:48.949
Stupid?

09:49.052 --> 09:51.486
But what about that one where
you played the teen president?

09:51.588 --> 09:53.180
Or the one where she saved
that talking whale.

09:53.289 --> 09:54.256
That was pretty good.

09:55.358 --> 09:56.416
Look, see, the thing is,

09:56.526 --> 09:58.721
is that, like, a week ago
my agent sent me this script.

09:58.828 --> 09:59.852
Right? It's amazing.

09:59.963 --> 10:01.328
It's based on a book.
A best seller.

10:01.431 --> 10:03.422
And my character
is a girl just like me.

10:03.533 --> 10:06.229
Wouldn't even have to act.
I would be myself, you know?

10:06.336 --> 10:08.361
But there is
this little tiny problem

10:08.471 --> 10:09.904
where I told them that I could ride.

10:10.006 --> 10:12.338
Well, I'm sure
if you just had more time.

10:12.509 --> 10:14.670
But see, I don't, right?
'Cause that's why I'm here.

10:14.778 --> 10:15.767
And I mean...

10:15.879 --> 10:19.337
Well, I mean, can't they get
a stunt double or whatever?

10:19.449 --> 10:21.747
Isn't that what they do
in Hollywood?

10:23.853 --> 10:25.650
Have you ever thought
about that kind of work?

10:25.755 --> 10:27.086
I mean, people must have told you

10:27.190 --> 10:28.919
you're a bit
of a Mindy Fanshaw type?

10:29.025 --> 10:31.994
No, actually, they haven't.

10:32.095 --> 10:33.926
I mean, not that you're a wannabe.

10:34.030 --> 10:35.588
You should take it as a compliment.

10:35.699 --> 10:37.326
I think you'd be just perfect anyhow.

10:42.338 --> 10:44.135
Oh, yeah. Okay.
This is a conference call.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.174
I have to be at the cabins,
like, 10 minutes ago.

10:46.276 --> 10:47.766
Well, I'll give you a ride
if you want.

10:47.877 --> 10:49.242
Yeah, that'd be great.
Let's go.

10:49.345 --> 10:51.939
I should probably go.
You know, just to, like, chaperone.

10:52.882 --> 10:53.678
Yeah.

10:55.819 --> 10:57.912
I got Mindy Fanshaw's helmet.

10:58.021 --> 11:00.080
It's all wet and sweaty.
Can I buy it from you?

11:00.190 --> 11:03.284
No, you're not buying this helmet.

11:03.393 --> 11:05.156
Her water bottle.
Even better.

11:05.261 --> 11:07.195
This has Mindy Fanshaw's
lipstick on it.

11:11.034 --> 11:12.501
Okay.

11:23.645 --> 11:25.078
Oh, wait. Wait, wait.

11:25.179 --> 11:27.113
Stop. Wait right there.

11:27.215 --> 11:30.207
I got to get a picture.
You just look so Western.

11:31.686 --> 11:33.313
Just turning this old boy out.

11:33.421 --> 11:34.410
What's his name?

11:34.522 --> 11:37.889
This is Pegasus.
He's Amy's dad's horse.

11:37.992 --> 11:39.857
Hi, Pegasus.

11:39.961 --> 11:42.191
He got into a bad wreck
at the stampede

11:42.297 --> 11:43.992
about 10 years ago now.

11:44.098 --> 11:46.066
We don't work him anymore.

11:46.167 --> 11:49.659
A horse with a backstory.
I love it.

11:49.771 --> 11:52.638
All horses have a story.
They're just like people.

11:52.807 --> 11:56.504
Yeah, I got a million stories.
But none of them are true.

11:56.611 --> 11:59.637
I guess it just comes
with the territory.

11:59.747 --> 12:01.374
You're just so lucky to live out here

12:01.482 --> 12:03.473
and be able to see things
as for how they are

12:03.585 --> 12:06.486
and not how some publicist
or fan site

12:06.588 --> 12:08.681
or celebrity tracker sees them.

12:08.790 --> 12:12.783
Well, we've got our own brand
of B.S. Out here, believe me.

12:12.894 --> 12:14.885
He does seem to like me, though.

12:14.996 --> 12:18.693
Well, he'd like you a lot more
if you gave him this.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.267
What's this?

12:20.368 --> 12:21.960
Keep your hand nice and flat.

12:22.070 --> 12:23.560
Oh!

12:24.539 --> 12:26.131
What's that?

12:26.307 --> 12:27.205
Hey, guys.

12:27.308 --> 12:28.536
Oh, my God.
You won't believe it.

12:28.643 --> 12:30.008
See those guys over there?

12:30.111 --> 12:33.842
They've been there since breakfast
ordering double espresso shots.

12:36.084 --> 12:37.608
So?

12:37.719 --> 12:39.152
They're paps.

12:39.253 --> 12:40.845
Paparazzi.

12:40.955 --> 12:43.549
Why would paparazzi
be in Hudson?

12:43.658 --> 12:46.058
They're looking for Mindy Fanshaw.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.991
- What?
- Yeah.

12:49.564 --> 12:52.089
Mindy Fanshaw?

12:53.034 --> 12:54.160
What makes you so sure?

12:54.268 --> 12:55.860
I swear to God.
She was in here yesterday.

12:55.970 --> 12:57.665
She bought boots
and that great belt.

12:57.772 --> 12:59.433
No way!

13:00.074 --> 13:02.099
Ladies.
Hello. I'm sorry to interrupt.

13:02.210 --> 13:04.178
I couldn't help but overhearing.

13:04.278 --> 13:06.508
So, now, you said
that you've seen Mindy Fanshaw?

13:06.614 --> 13:09.981
Yeah. Standing right here.

13:10.118 --> 13:11.813
Actually, more over there.

13:11.953 --> 13:13.352
Yeah, over there.

13:13.454 --> 13:16.184
You know, I'll tell you what.
If you see her again...

13:16.290 --> 13:18.383
Here's my card.
Just give me a call, yeah?

13:18.493 --> 13:20.893
- I'll make it worth your while.
- Thanks.

13:21.696 --> 13:23.391
Thank you.

13:24.832 --> 13:26.094
Paparazzi?

13:27.201 --> 13:28.429
In Maggie's.

13:28.536 --> 13:29.969
This could be very bad for us.

13:30.071 --> 13:31.163
I'll tell you what's bad.

13:31.272 --> 13:33.900
That stupid
confidentiality agreement.

13:34.008 --> 13:36.067
Do you know what it felt like
to lie to my friends?

13:36.177 --> 13:37.838
Look, it's just
for a little while, okay?

13:37.945 --> 13:40.675
Everybody's lying.
Even Mindy lied about her riding.

13:40.782 --> 13:42.443
I mean, she's basically
a total beginner.

13:42.550 --> 13:45.041
She didn't lie, okay?
Her agent lied.

13:45.186 --> 13:46.153
Oh, whatever.

13:46.254 --> 13:48.848
I don't know how I'm gonna teach her
to ride in a couple of days.

13:48.956 --> 13:50.287
You don't have to teach her to ride.

13:50.391 --> 13:52.985
Just teach her enough
so she can act like she can ride,

13:53.094 --> 13:54.186
and then they'll double her.

13:54.295 --> 13:55.489
It's what they do.

13:55.596 --> 13:58.258
I know, she offered me the job.

13:58.366 --> 13:59.765
To be her riding double?

14:01.069 --> 14:02.593
She thinks I kind of look like her.

14:03.805 --> 14:05.033
Yeah?

14:05.139 --> 14:06.902
I guess. Maybe.

14:07.008 --> 14:10.034
If you, like, squint your eyes
and get pretty far away

14:10.144 --> 14:13.375
and do, like, movie magic.

14:13.481 --> 14:14.812
Shut up!

14:19.654 --> 14:21.144
Hey.

14:21.255 --> 14:22.222
Hey.

14:22.957 --> 14:25.619
I'm just going out with Kit
unless you need anything.

14:25.727 --> 14:27.194
No.

14:27.295 --> 14:28.853
Have fun, though.

14:34.335 --> 14:35.802
Hey, did you see Caleb today?

14:35.903 --> 14:37.803
Mindy had him
going pretty good, huh?

14:37.905 --> 14:38.872
Yeah.

14:38.973 --> 14:42.306
You know, it's funny how some guys
fall for that whole movie-star thing.

14:42.410 --> 14:45.777
What, you think I'm all impressed
because she's some big movie star?

14:45.880 --> 14:48.440
No. Not you. Definitely.

14:48.549 --> 14:52.349
I mean, if you were,
then you hid it really well.

14:52.453 --> 14:55.047
And I know you pretty good, so...

14:55.156 --> 14:57.522
Well, I believe you,
but I know you pretty well, too.

15:01.796 --> 15:02.956
I'll see you.

15:07.068 --> 15:09.730
Wow.
That was quite a performance.

15:09.837 --> 15:11.270
You totally sold the fact

15:11.372 --> 15:14.205
that you didn't care he was
going out with another girl.

15:14.308 --> 15:16.276
I should be taking lessons
from you.

15:16.377 --> 15:18.971
I mean, not riding lessons.
Acting lessons.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.513
Give me a break.

15:20.615 --> 15:23.379
You're telling me
you're not all about that guy?

15:23.484 --> 15:24.849
No.

15:24.952 --> 15:27.887
I mean, maybe I was once.

15:27.989 --> 15:31.083
But that was a while ago.
That's over.

15:31.192 --> 15:33.558
Yeah, sure. No.
Whatever you say.

15:33.661 --> 15:36.152
I didn't come here
to pry into your love life.

15:36.264 --> 15:38.164
Anyway, I actually
just wanted to tell you

15:38.266 --> 15:40.427
I was sorry about today.

15:40.535 --> 15:43.732
My people should have been
more up-front with you.

15:43.838 --> 15:47.171
I've really only been on a horse
once in my life.

15:47.275 --> 15:49.402
It was a pony.
Best friend's birthday party.

15:49.510 --> 15:51.375
I was six.

15:51.479 --> 15:52.571
I wish you had told me that.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.739
I would have put you
on a different horse.

15:54.849 --> 15:57.875
What about this guy?
He's so beautiful.

15:57.985 --> 16:00.886
He has such sad eyes.
I'll bet he's seen a lot.

16:01.923 --> 16:05.324
Look, it's like he knows me.

16:06.260 --> 16:09.161
Pegasus, he hasn't
been doing so well lately.

16:09.263 --> 16:10.696
So, no. You can't ride him.

16:10.798 --> 16:13.130
That must be hard.

16:13.234 --> 16:17.534
I can tell with you
he's not just another horse,

16:17.638 --> 16:18.730
he's part of your family.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.637
Yeah, he is.

16:22.743 --> 16:27.806
I meant what I said, you know,
about you being my riding double.

16:30.351 --> 16:31.818
Look.

16:31.919 --> 16:34.114
We could be sisters.

16:40.094 --> 16:43.894
Hey, Jack. Have you seen
Mindy's water bottle?

16:43.998 --> 16:45.625
How am I supposed to find it now?

16:45.733 --> 16:47.598
I didn't know
you were such a big fan.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.260
You wouldn't understand.

16:49.370 --> 16:52.305
I finally talked to your dad.
He's been off the grid.

16:52.406 --> 16:57.070
He didn't even get my message
till him and your mom hit Whitehorse.

16:57.178 --> 16:59.112
Give it to me full on, Jack.
I can take it.

16:59.213 --> 17:03.582
Well, until a more permanent solution
can be reached,

17:03.684 --> 17:06.209
we've decided
that you'll be going back...

17:06.319 --> 17:08.049
To Blessed Virgin Academy?

17:08.155 --> 17:10.817
You might as well just tear out
my heart and wrap it in plaid!

17:10.925 --> 17:13.450
Going back to you staying here,

17:13.560 --> 17:16.223
going to your old school,
and doing your chores.

17:16.329 --> 17:19.265
Starting with recycling.

17:19.599 --> 17:22.090
Thank you, Jack.
You won't regret it.

17:24.771 --> 17:25.761
Yeah.

17:32.780 --> 17:35.578
Talk about a Hollywood moment. I...

17:35.683 --> 17:37.913
You're not working
for the tabloids, though, right?

17:38.019 --> 17:41.045
No, I signed
that confidentiality agreement.

17:41.155 --> 17:43.851
Can't speak
for the horses, though.

17:43.958 --> 17:45.949
You know, I never thought

17:46.060 --> 17:50.554
I would ever feel so deeply
about a horse.

17:50.665 --> 17:53.065
And then Amy was telling me
about Pegasus

17:53.167 --> 17:56.728
and how he's so old and sick.

17:56.837 --> 17:57.826
And I just...

17:58.005 --> 18:02.942
You know, if I had a horse,
and it died,

18:03.044 --> 18:04.909
a little piece of me
would die, too.

18:06.647 --> 18:09.707
And I've never opened
my heart up to anything

18:09.817 --> 18:11.409
like I have since I got here.

18:11.519 --> 18:16.081
You know, and not just the horses,
but the people.

18:16.190 --> 18:18.283
I know we haven't spent
that much time together,

18:18.392 --> 18:19.723
but I just feel like...

18:21.228 --> 18:24.994
Well, some people can live
a lifetime in a minute.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.961
Are you okay?

18:28.069 --> 18:30.196
Yeah, I'm just...

18:30.304 --> 18:32.795
Could you hold me
for a minute, please?

18:35.476 --> 18:37.569
It's okay.

18:44.885 --> 18:47.649
All right.
Now I understand.

18:47.755 --> 18:48.687
You understand what?

18:48.789 --> 18:50.916
It's just so tragic, you know?

18:51.025 --> 18:54.517
I mean, obviously you're still
totally in love with Amy, too.

18:54.628 --> 18:55.959
Amy said that she...

18:56.063 --> 18:57.894
Well, see, Amy and I,
we're like, you know...

18:57.999 --> 18:59.398
We're friends, so...

18:59.500 --> 19:01.400
She tells me everything.

19:03.137 --> 19:04.798
Look, I've got to water the horses.

19:04.905 --> 19:07.806
And they need some hay, too, so...

19:10.711 --> 19:13.077
Whatever. Knock yourself out.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.618
I was just worried about him.

19:22.723 --> 19:26.090
You know, he seems to be
slowing down, losing weight.

19:26.193 --> 19:27.387
You're not working him, are you?

19:27.561 --> 19:29.893
No, he's just been out in the field
with the other horses.

19:30.498 --> 19:33.296
Well, maybe the younger horses
are beating him to the hay.

19:33.401 --> 19:36.302
Why don't you stable him for a while,
change his feed?

19:36.404 --> 19:39.931
Well, feed is Lou's department.

19:40.041 --> 19:42.441
Maybe you should talk to her.

19:42.543 --> 19:45.444
It's been a while.

19:51.919 --> 19:52.613
Hey.

19:54.088 --> 19:55.316
So, how you doing, Lou?

19:55.423 --> 19:58.688
Great, great.
Couldn't be better.

20:01.762 --> 20:02.694
Okay.

20:02.797 --> 20:06.995
I was seeing Mark,
and it didn't quite work out.

20:07.101 --> 20:08.966
But, like, in a good way.

20:09.070 --> 20:11.265
How about you?

20:11.372 --> 20:12.464
Nothing serious.

20:12.573 --> 20:14.803
No? Playing the field?

20:14.909 --> 20:16.604
Yeah, I guess you could say.

20:17.478 --> 20:21.073
So, just out of curiosity,
how big is that field?

20:23.451 --> 20:25.885
I've got to take this call.

20:25.986 --> 20:27.851
- I'll see you next time.
- Okay.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.894
Yeah, I'm just with a client.

20:33.994 --> 20:36.792
Yeah, I'm on my way. Okay.

20:37.465 --> 20:39.763
What happened to Mindy
tacking up her own horse?

20:39.867 --> 20:42.631
Well, I guess I just figured
that she's a guest,

20:42.736 --> 20:44.260
and we don't have a lot of time.

20:44.371 --> 20:47.169
But you have time to spill your guts.

20:47.274 --> 20:49.970
What is that supposed to mean?

20:50.077 --> 20:53.046
I can't believe you'd talk about us
with someone like her.

20:53.147 --> 20:56.048
She just...
She asked me about you,

20:56.150 --> 20:57.674
and I didn't know what to say.

20:57.785 --> 20:59.013
And...

21:00.154 --> 21:02.987
Well, apparently
she talked to you, too, 'cause...

21:04.091 --> 21:07.026
You know,
I don't know why it matters.

21:07.128 --> 21:10.928
I mean, everyone knows
you're with Kit, so...

21:11.632 --> 21:14.567
Look, all I'm trying to say
is that...

21:14.668 --> 21:16.693
It's weird, okay?
I mean, you think...

21:16.804 --> 21:18.965
You see her face
in magazines and movies,

21:19.073 --> 21:20.973
and you think you know her,
but you don't.

21:21.075 --> 21:22.565
And don't think
that she's your friend,

21:22.676 --> 21:23.802
'cause she's not.

21:24.612 --> 21:26.876
You take away the fact
that she's famous

21:26.981 --> 21:30.041
and kind of beautiful and...

21:33.621 --> 21:36.852
I don't know
what I'm trying to say, okay?

21:38.492 --> 21:41.359
Just be careful, Amy.

21:45.266 --> 21:47.860
Okay. So, just weave
through these standards.

21:48.035 --> 21:49.434
You're looking good.

21:49.537 --> 21:51.232
Okay. But I want to...

21:51.338 --> 21:53.363
Okay. Just shorten your reins up.

21:53.541 --> 21:55.372
But he's not doing
what I want him to do.

21:55.476 --> 21:56.101
Go.

21:56.210 --> 21:57.268
Take your hand further down.

21:57.378 --> 21:59.107
Yeah. Now take hold
of your inside rein.

21:59.213 --> 22:00.908
There you go.

22:02.616 --> 22:04.675
Okay. We're doing it.

22:04.785 --> 22:06.218
We're doing it.

22:07.521 --> 22:11.252
Hey, since when do you guys
lock the gate?

22:12.426 --> 22:14.587
It's Lou. Something to do
with the dude ranch.

22:14.695 --> 22:17.095
Well, unlock it.
I want to ride my horse.

22:18.265 --> 22:20.756
That's the deal. I can't.

22:20.868 --> 22:23.132
See, Amy's down there
with one of the dudes now.

22:23.237 --> 22:25.899
And, well, the gate's
got to stay locked.

22:26.006 --> 22:27.234
What?

22:27.341 --> 22:30.674
To make sure the dudes
don't skip without paying?

22:30.778 --> 22:31.938
Something like that.

22:32.980 --> 22:34.914
Hey, so how's things at home?

22:35.015 --> 22:37.108
It's bearable.

22:37.218 --> 22:38.845
Barely.

22:38.953 --> 22:40.978
What do you even care?

22:41.088 --> 22:43.454
I care.

22:43.557 --> 22:45.286
So, please unlock it.

22:47.361 --> 22:48.988
I can't.

22:51.599 --> 22:52.998
I'm sorry, Ash.

23:01.342 --> 23:04.209
You know, this is the best thing
I've ever done.

23:04.311 --> 23:06.370
It's nice once you form a connection
with a horse.

23:06.480 --> 23:10.507
Tell me about it.
This is better than any therapy.

23:10.618 --> 23:12.017
You know, I was thinking.

23:12.119 --> 23:14.679
I know a lot of people in L.A.,
and they got lots of money.

23:14.788 --> 23:18.155
I'm pretty sure I could make things
happen for you down there.

23:18.259 --> 23:19.590
You know?

23:19.693 --> 23:21.251
Do you want to try something crazy?

23:21.362 --> 23:22.659
Yes, I do. Bring it on.

23:22.763 --> 23:24.788
All right.
Grab your reins with one hand.

23:24.898 --> 23:25.887
- Like this?
- Yeah.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.558
And hold your saddle horn
with the other.

23:27.668 --> 23:28.464
- Okay.
- You got it?

23:28.569 --> 23:29.399
- Yeah.
- Hang on.

23:29.503 --> 23:30.629
- Yeah.
- Okay.

23:31.438 --> 23:33.565
Woo!

23:39.680 --> 23:42.945
You know, Jack,
you have a really incredible face.

23:43.050 --> 23:47.146
Well, I guess I wasn't
all that bad-Iooking once.

23:47.288 --> 23:49.518
Oh, come on, Grandpa, admit it.
You were a babe.

23:49.623 --> 23:50.954
Well, now...

23:51.058 --> 23:53.117
You know, that is the thing
about L.A.

23:53.227 --> 23:55.024
I mean, if you were there,
for instance,

23:55.129 --> 23:58.621
you couldn't look
all old and tired and wrinkly.

23:58.732 --> 24:01.326
You know? You always
have to be camera-ready.

24:01.502 --> 24:03.367
Well, I guess
I'll cancel my ticket, then.

24:04.371 --> 24:05.998
Seriously, I mean,
can you imagine?

24:06.106 --> 24:07.664
Like, I can't even
take out the garbage

24:07.775 --> 24:09.800
without people shoving cameras
all in my face.

24:09.977 --> 24:12.207
You take out the garbage?

24:12.379 --> 24:15.041
Oh, no, sweetie.

24:15.149 --> 24:18.209
It's just kind of a metaphor
for my entire life.

24:19.420 --> 24:22.048
Speaking of your life,
is what they're saying true?

24:22.156 --> 24:24.556
"Mindy quits rehab.
Drunk and Disorderly."

24:24.658 --> 24:25.386
Mallory.

24:25.526 --> 24:28.188
No, no, no. Give that to me.
Thank you.

24:28.329 --> 24:29.694
Hm.

24:30.197 --> 24:33.223
Oh, yeah.
Pole-dancing in Vegas. Sure.

24:33.334 --> 24:35.268
It was a gym in Lake Tahoe.

24:35.369 --> 24:36.427
Obviously.

24:36.537 --> 24:38.596
Nothing that they say in here
is true.

24:38.706 --> 24:41.470
Except your skin
does kind of look blotchy.

24:41.575 --> 24:44.066
Well, Melanie, honey,
at least I didn't shave my head.

24:44.178 --> 24:45.736
Maybe not your head, but...

24:45.846 --> 24:47.040
Mallory, put that away.

24:47.147 --> 24:49.945
Yeah. Give it.
Bedtime reading.

24:51.752 --> 24:55.051
Cowboy, how about giving me
a ride back to my cabin?

24:55.155 --> 24:56.622
Sure. Yeah.

24:56.724 --> 25:00.956
I mean, why not?

25:05.065 --> 25:07.966
- Good night.
- Bye.

25:08.702 --> 25:09.862
Melanie?

25:09.970 --> 25:12.461
Give her a break.
She meets a lot of people.

25:12.573 --> 25:14.905
She probably can't remember
everybody's name.

25:15.008 --> 25:18.603
Yeah. Okay.
Whatever you say, Zack.

25:30.457 --> 25:31.754
You are such a gentleman.

25:31.859 --> 25:34.327
Well, not always.
That's for sure.

25:34.428 --> 25:38.455
What about right now?

25:48.375 --> 25:51.674
Don't get me wrong.
I know who you are.

25:51.779 --> 25:55.579
Maybe I'm just an idiot,
but I don't want to waste your time.

25:55.682 --> 25:58.845
I work here.
And you're a guest.

25:58.952 --> 26:03.912
This doesn't have anything to do
with Amy, does it?

26:04.758 --> 26:08.353
Talk about wasting your time.
She is totally into Ty.

26:09.229 --> 26:10.628
And how would you know that?

26:10.731 --> 26:13.859
Oh, besides the fact
that it's so in-your-face obvious?

26:13.967 --> 26:15.093
She told me.

26:15.202 --> 26:16.863
She told you?

26:16.970 --> 26:19.598
Wow. What is it with that girl
and you guys?

26:19.773 --> 26:22.571
It's just...
I mean, get over it.

26:22.676 --> 26:26.772
You know, my bodyguard
has the night off.

26:26.880 --> 26:30.714
Just wondering
if maybe you want the job.

26:47.767 --> 26:48.756
In a minute.

26:52.705 --> 26:54.434
It's so beautiful.

26:54.540 --> 26:57.441
I just feel like everything
I've ever done in my entire life,

26:57.543 --> 27:02.173
it's just been to bring me here
to this place.

27:02.314 --> 27:03.008
Oh!

27:03.115 --> 27:05.777
I should get the producer
of the movie out here.

27:05.885 --> 27:07.785
There's still one cabin available.

27:07.887 --> 27:10.287
I'm not talking vacation.
I'm talking location.

27:10.389 --> 27:11.981
We could rent the entire ranch

27:12.091 --> 27:14.252
and then just shoot the movie
right here.

27:14.426 --> 27:15.290
What do you say?

27:15.394 --> 27:17.157
You know, I have to check
with reservations,

27:17.263 --> 27:19.823
but I think that...

27:19.932 --> 27:22.332
But you do have to get
the part first, right?

27:22.501 --> 27:24.867
Psh. Details.

27:24.970 --> 27:28.064
You know, I think that would be
an amazing opportunity for you.

27:28.174 --> 27:29.732
Really. You should just go for it.

27:29.909 --> 27:31.638
You know, you should just grab it

27:31.744 --> 27:34.508
and clutch on to it
till your knuckles turn white.

27:34.613 --> 27:35.511
Yeah.

27:35.648 --> 27:37.513
- Oh, this looks great. Thank you.
- Okay.

27:40.753 --> 27:42.084
She's up for this really big part.

27:42.188 --> 27:45.589
And even though she's been in rehab,
she's totally blitzed all the time.

27:45.640 --> 27:48.094
You really shouldn't judge someone
if you don't know all the facts.

27:48.594 --> 27:51.154
Oh, yeah, right.
I mean, take a look at this.

27:51.263 --> 27:53.561
You really believe
what you read in the tabloids?

27:53.666 --> 27:55.258
I mean, look at that.
It must be ancient.

27:55.367 --> 27:57.301
Her hair's way too short.

27:57.403 --> 27:58.028
See ya.

28:03.409 --> 28:05.673
Hey, Amy! Wait!

28:05.778 --> 28:06.745
I don't get you.

28:06.846 --> 28:09.337
All of a sudden
you're a Mindy Fanshaw expert?

28:09.448 --> 28:11.279
Or you're hiding something.

28:11.383 --> 28:13.351
Because you're the worst liar
in the world.

28:13.452 --> 28:16.421
And I can tell
that you're lying right now.

28:16.522 --> 28:18.114
Okay.

28:18.224 --> 28:20.488
You have to promise
not to repeat this.

28:20.593 --> 28:23.460
Mindy Fanshaw?
At Heartland?

28:23.562 --> 28:25.928
I've been giving her riding lessons.

28:26.031 --> 28:27.259
Wow.

28:27.366 --> 28:30.096
I didn't really think
you were lying, but...

28:30.202 --> 28:32.295
Man, you really folded fast.

28:32.404 --> 28:35.703
Note to self...
Never tell you anything.

28:35.808 --> 28:37.639
That goes for me, too.

28:37.743 --> 28:39.870
Soraya, I had to sign
this stupid confidentiality...

28:39.979 --> 28:42.072
You're supposed to be
my best friend.

28:42.181 --> 28:44.581
And you just stood there,
and you never said a word?

28:44.683 --> 28:45.707
I couldn't!

28:45.818 --> 28:47.217
Don't talk to me.

28:47.319 --> 28:48.377
Soraya!

28:48.487 --> 28:49.385
Soraya!

28:50.990 --> 28:52.617
- Hi. I'm...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

28:53.425 --> 28:55.552
Didn't you hear
about the Celebrity Rights Act?

28:55.661 --> 28:58.221
It bars random fans
from speaking to celebrities

28:58.330 --> 29:01.094
unless they've been introduced
or they already know each other

29:01.200 --> 29:02.895
or it's for work.

29:03.002 --> 29:04.902
Well, how about the rights
of former fans

29:05.004 --> 29:06.631
who realize
that a so-called celebrity

29:06.739 --> 29:10.607
made a bunch of lame movies
and now they want their money back?

29:12.278 --> 29:14.712
Mindy, this is my friend Ashley.

29:22.755 --> 29:25.155
Door's open.

29:29.728 --> 29:32.026
Jake, what can I do for you?

29:32.131 --> 29:34.190
Is Mallory here?

29:34.300 --> 29:37.827
Now, what makes you think
she's here

29:37.937 --> 29:39.666
and not at boarding school?

29:42.608 --> 29:44.701
What did she tell you, Mr. Bartlett?

29:45.344 --> 29:46.777
Nothing.

29:46.879 --> 29:48.540
My lips are sealed.

29:48.647 --> 29:50.342
For once.

29:50.449 --> 29:52.644
Jake's are, too.

29:55.087 --> 29:58.523
I wanted to pay you back,
but Jack recycled my water bottle.

29:58.624 --> 29:59.613
Your water bottle?

29:59.725 --> 30:02.057
Yeah, but I got something
even better.

30:02.161 --> 30:04.152
Guess whose lipstick this is.

30:05.631 --> 30:08.361
- She's really pretty.
- You wear lipstick?

30:09.134 --> 30:10.931
It's not me.
She's famous.

30:11.036 --> 30:12.901
I would tell you,
but it's a secret,

30:13.005 --> 30:14.939
and Lou made me sign
this stupid paper.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.974
I understand.
If it's a secret...

30:17.076 --> 30:19.544
Mindy Fanshaw.
She's staying here.

30:19.645 --> 30:22.170
I can get a bunch of stuff
that she's personally used.

30:22.348 --> 30:24.782
We can sell it on eBay
and make a fortune,

30:24.883 --> 30:25.975
and I can pay you back.

30:26.085 --> 30:27.074
I don't want money.

30:27.186 --> 30:29.552
I helped you out
'cause that's the kind of guy I am.

30:39.064 --> 30:40.656
Hey.

30:42.034 --> 30:44.525
This your idea of night life?

30:44.636 --> 30:47.628
Well, it is a school night.

30:48.173 --> 30:50.403
So, what did the vet say
about my beautiful horse?

30:50.509 --> 30:52.534
He just needs
to gain some weight.

30:52.644 --> 30:54.509
So, he's not sick?
Can I ride him?

30:54.680 --> 30:58.309
No. I told you before.

31:02.221 --> 31:05.054
I hope you don't mind me
hanging out here for a little bit.

31:05.224 --> 31:08.751
It's so boring at the cabins.
I don't have anyone to talk to.

31:09.361 --> 31:11.886
What about that bodyguard
of yours?

31:11.997 --> 31:13.794
See, rule number one...

31:13.899 --> 31:16.129
You never get involved
with your bodyguard.

31:16.235 --> 31:17.429
Rule number two...

31:17.536 --> 31:18.935
You never get involved

31:19.038 --> 31:21.268
with your riding instructor's
boyfriend,

31:21.373 --> 31:24.240
even though she swears
he's not her boyfriend,

31:24.410 --> 31:26.776
and he's a really good kisser.

31:27.446 --> 31:28.777
Ty?

31:28.947 --> 31:31.939
I don't know. Or Caleb.

31:32.051 --> 31:33.313
See, I say "boyfriend,"

31:33.419 --> 31:35.148
and you don't even know
who I'm talking about.

31:35.254 --> 31:36.619
You think I don't know

31:36.722 --> 31:39.122
that you're playing those boys
off against each other?

31:47.466 --> 31:49.593
Ty.

31:49.701 --> 31:51.862
- Wonder what she wants.
- I don't know.

31:51.970 --> 31:54.302
But whatever it is,
she's probably gonna get it.

31:54.406 --> 31:56.465
She's not the easiest girl
to turn down.

31:56.575 --> 31:58.907
Not that anyone would want to.

31:59.011 --> 32:02.139
So, there's this place
somebody was telling me about

32:02.247 --> 32:03.271
that I have to see.

32:03.382 --> 32:05.577
Mustang Meadows.

32:05.684 --> 32:06.981
So, which one of you boys

32:07.086 --> 32:08.986
want to saddle up my horse
and take me there?

32:09.088 --> 32:11.318
Well, Amy's gonna be back
from school pretty soon, so...

32:11.423 --> 32:14.950
Oh, yeah, see,
there's this weird thing about me

32:15.060 --> 32:17.961
you might not know...
I hate waiting.

32:18.063 --> 32:20.623
Good. I hate to keep a lady waiting.

32:27.172 --> 32:30.403
I don't know why you want Pegasus.
He's kind of old and slow.

32:30.509 --> 32:32.568
Oh, well, we have
a special connection.

32:32.678 --> 32:35.078
Yeah, you don't get it.
Amy got it right away.

32:35.180 --> 32:37.375
The only thing Amy's gonna get
is ticked off.

32:37.483 --> 32:38.973
She just had Scott
in to see him, Caleb.

32:39.084 --> 32:41.450
Well, I swear she said
it was okay, so...

32:41.553 --> 32:44.351
Relax, bro. We're just going
for a little trail ride.

32:44.456 --> 32:46.390
Besides, I don't have to remind you

32:46.492 --> 32:47.857
it's good to mix things up
now and again.

32:50.662 --> 32:51.822
Ah!

32:51.930 --> 32:53.363
There you go.

32:53.465 --> 32:54.227
Okay.

32:58.604 --> 33:02.040
You sure this is the way
to Mustang Meadow?

33:02.141 --> 33:04.939
Well, this is the scenic route.

33:05.043 --> 33:09.343
Well, I've already had
all the scenery I can stand.

33:11.183 --> 33:12.582
Hey.

33:12.684 --> 33:15.482
Have you seen Pegasus?
He wasn't in his stall.

33:15.587 --> 33:17.885
Mindy took him out.
With Caleb.

33:17.990 --> 33:20.015
You just let them go?

33:20.125 --> 33:23.458
She said you were good with it.

33:33.639 --> 33:36.574
There they are.
Down there.

33:49.354 --> 33:51.754
No. Great.

33:52.457 --> 33:54.618
Look, Joey and Dawson.

33:54.726 --> 33:56.353
I told you
you couldn't ride that horse.

33:56.495 --> 33:57.519
What were you thinking?

33:57.629 --> 34:00.291
- Hey, Mindy. Over here.
- Give us a big cowgirl smile.

34:01.700 --> 34:02.894
Pull up on your reins!

34:03.001 --> 34:05.435
I can't! Help!

34:05.604 --> 34:06.468
Mindy!

34:09.675 --> 34:10.539
Mindy!

34:12.945 --> 34:13.969
Mindy!

34:14.646 --> 34:15.670
Are you all right?

34:20.552 --> 34:22.520
Woo! That was incredible!

34:22.621 --> 34:23.952
Oh, my God, what a rush!

34:24.056 --> 34:26.149
- Which one's your new boyfriend?
- They found me out here.

34:26.257 --> 34:28.283
I'm okay!

34:28.393 --> 34:30.918
Do I look okay?

34:41.806 --> 34:43.364
Hey.

34:45.509 --> 34:50.071
I'm really sorry I didn't tell you
about Mindy Fanshaw.

34:52.350 --> 34:53.715
So, I guess, you know,

34:53.818 --> 34:55.786
if you told someone
that she was staying at Heartland,

34:55.886 --> 34:57.217
I would totally understand.

34:57.955 --> 34:59.582
What are you talking about?

35:00.558 --> 35:03.721
Well, someone told
those photographers where she was.

35:03.828 --> 35:05.819
And I mean, it was
in the middle of nowhere.

35:05.930 --> 35:07.989
They must have followed her
or something.

35:08.099 --> 35:11.466
First, you lie to me,
and now you're blaming me?

35:11.569 --> 35:13.332
Look, Amy, I don't know
why you're here.

35:13.437 --> 35:16.167
But if you're looking for coffee
or a Coke or something like that,

35:16.273 --> 35:17.399
forget it, we're closed.

35:23.447 --> 35:25.244
I thought you were gonna
take it easy on this old guy.

35:25.383 --> 35:26.748
What's wrong with him?

35:26.851 --> 35:27.840
I was feeding the horses,

35:27.952 --> 35:29.613
and he couldn't even walk
to his grain bin.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.244
- So, I called Scott.
- Good thing.

35:31.355 --> 35:33.152
He's got stone bruises
on his feet.

35:33.257 --> 35:36.090
And he's got a chipped bone
in his hock.

35:37.061 --> 35:38.551
How bad is it?

35:38.662 --> 35:40.994
Well, for his age,
it's pretty serious.

35:42.767 --> 35:44.132
What are we supposed to do?

35:44.235 --> 35:47.170
Butazone. Maybe surgery.

35:47.271 --> 35:49.865
But we got to think
about whether he can handle that.

35:49.974 --> 35:51.874
I thought that girl had more sense,

35:51.976 --> 35:54.968
or at least that she had
some feelings for that horse.

35:55.079 --> 35:56.671
Well, you were wrong.

35:56.781 --> 35:58.544
I guess we all were.

36:08.426 --> 36:09.723
Amy!

36:09.860 --> 36:12.158
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
I just want to talk to you.

36:12.263 --> 36:15.164
I feel really terrible.
And I know it's all my fault.

36:15.266 --> 36:17.291
And I will totally pay
for all the vet bills.

36:17.401 --> 36:20.302
This is not about bills.

36:21.672 --> 36:23.230
I get it. Caleb.

36:23.340 --> 36:25.240
I went riding with Caleb.

36:25.342 --> 36:26.775
You think this is about Caleb?

36:26.877 --> 36:29.038
Well, you see, that's the thing
about being an actress

36:29.146 --> 36:31.671
is that I learn
how to read between the lines.

36:31.782 --> 36:34.148
I mean, both those guys
obviously have a thing for you.

36:34.251 --> 36:36.719
What are you gonna do? You just
gonna string them along forever?

36:36.821 --> 36:38.015
You know what?
You have no clue.

36:38.122 --> 36:39.248
Okay, Pegasus, he could have...

36:40.391 --> 36:42.018
Oh, sorry.
Sorry, I got to take this.

36:42.126 --> 36:42.820
Hello?

36:42.927 --> 36:43.916
I'll talk to you in a minute.

36:44.028 --> 36:45.723
Hi. No, I didn't see them yet.

36:45.830 --> 36:47.297
But everyone says
they're really good.

36:47.398 --> 36:48.888
Really?

36:48.999 --> 36:51.365
Oh, my God!
I'm so excited!

36:58.476 --> 37:00.637
There's something
that's been bothering me.

37:04.014 --> 37:07.108
You say that you ran away
from Blessed Virgin

37:07.218 --> 37:10.654
because the pizza was frozen,

37:10.754 --> 37:14.349
the nights were long,
and the Internet was slow.

37:15.326 --> 37:18.454
But that pretty well
describes life right here.

37:18.562 --> 37:21.224
There were many other reasons.

37:22.399 --> 37:23.866
I'd like to hear one.

37:23.968 --> 37:25.367
Okay.

37:25.469 --> 37:27.164
Obviously I missed everyone.

37:27.338 --> 37:29.431
But the thing I didn't plan on
was Jake.

37:29.540 --> 37:30.973
He knew exactly
what I was thinking.

37:31.075 --> 37:31.939
He took charge.

37:32.042 --> 37:33.566
He bought me a bus ticket

37:33.677 --> 37:35.872
and even had two horses
waiting in Hudson.

37:35.980 --> 37:39.211
Well, that sounds very romantic.

37:39.316 --> 37:40.806
That's my problem.

37:40.918 --> 37:43.648
That's why
I just want to pay him back.

37:43.754 --> 37:45.619
I just don't want him
to get the wrong idea.

37:50.094 --> 37:51.459
Yeah.

37:51.562 --> 37:53.621
I'm looking at them
right now, Lauren.

37:55.399 --> 37:57.458
She said what?

37:57.568 --> 38:00.594
"One-star roach motel"?

38:00.704 --> 38:02.433
Yeah.

38:02.540 --> 38:07.477
Well, so much for renting
the whole place as a location.

38:07.578 --> 38:09.773
You're kidding.
You got me a meeting?

38:09.880 --> 38:12.110
Did you tell them I don't audition?

38:13.751 --> 38:14.718
Hang on.

38:14.818 --> 38:17.116
Hi. Sorry. I'm on the phone.

38:17.221 --> 38:18.711
Okay, then get off the phone.

38:19.290 --> 38:21.520
Oh, okay.
What's your problem?

38:21.625 --> 38:22.922
Just, this is my room.

38:23.027 --> 38:26.986
No, actually, this is my room.
And this is my problem.

38:27.097 --> 38:28.826
I don't care if you have
to pull pathetic stunts

38:28.933 --> 38:30.298
to prop up your failing career.

38:30.401 --> 38:32.562
But when you put
my dad's horse at risk...

38:32.670 --> 38:34.729
I'm sorry.
This is about a horse?

38:34.838 --> 38:39.070
'Cause I already told Amy
I'd pay for the, you know, whatever.

38:39.944 --> 38:41.707
You know what?
Pack your bags.

38:41.812 --> 38:43.279
Or get someone
to pack them for you.

38:43.380 --> 38:44.472
Or whatever you have to do.

38:44.582 --> 38:47.210
I want you out of here. Now.

38:58.462 --> 39:00.953
Hey, buddy.

39:01.799 --> 39:03.733
Look what I got for you.

39:05.703 --> 39:08.365
Come on.
It's your favorite.

39:10.274 --> 39:11.901
What, you don't like me anymore?

39:13.744 --> 39:18.044
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

39:18.148 --> 39:19.615
Okay, well...

39:19.717 --> 39:24.051
Just gonna leave it right here
on the fence.

39:24.888 --> 39:27.152
Bye.

39:37.635 --> 39:39.125
Amy. Hi.

39:39.236 --> 39:40.863
I'm glad I got a chance
to talk to you

39:40.971 --> 39:43.565
before your insane sister
trashes me.

39:43.674 --> 39:45.164
She's probably gonna tell you

39:45.275 --> 39:47.402
that I told the paparazzi
where I'd be.

39:47.511 --> 39:49.308
- And did you?
- No. Never.

39:49.413 --> 39:51.847
Well, not technically.
I mean, my P.R. People did.

39:51.949 --> 39:55.009
But I just needed something fresh.
You know, different.

39:55.119 --> 39:57.644
Instead of all the shopping
and clubbing and...

39:57.755 --> 40:01.282
But I really, really didn't think
it was gonna turn out that way.

40:01.392 --> 40:04.293
I didn't know a horse
could just hurt itself like that.

40:04.395 --> 40:05.760
I'll make it up to you, Amy.

40:05.863 --> 40:07.888
And how do you expect to do that?
Huh?

40:07.998 --> 40:09.192
You just about killed my horse.

40:09.299 --> 40:10.766
My best friend
won't even talk to me.

40:10.868 --> 40:13.860
I have no idea what games
you played with Ty and Caleb.

40:13.971 --> 40:15.836
And not to mention,
you bought that damn belt.

40:15.939 --> 40:17.236
Look, for what it's worth,

40:17.341 --> 40:19.275
nothing happened
between Caleb and me.

40:19.376 --> 40:21.401
Or Ty and me. It's weird.

40:21.512 --> 40:24.481
Yeah, I don't even know
why I fell for that bogus offer

40:24.581 --> 40:25.843
to be your riding double.

40:25.949 --> 40:29.749
Well, that's because you don't
know much about people like me.

40:29.853 --> 40:31.582
But that offer?
It still stands.

40:31.689 --> 40:32.951
Honestly, anytime.

40:33.057 --> 40:34.957
You call me,
I'll send you a ticket.

40:35.059 --> 40:36.356
Okay? Sorry.
Just hang on a minute.

40:37.928 --> 40:39.919
My life coach. Hello?

40:40.030 --> 40:41.292
What? Yeah. Okay.

40:41.465 --> 40:45.458
Okay, I'll talk to you later, Amy.
Bye.

40:57.414 --> 41:00.713
Well, if it isn't the Lone Ranger.

41:00.818 --> 41:03.878
I heard about your midnight ride.

41:03.987 --> 41:06.922
You don't for a second think
I approve of what of you did.

41:07.024 --> 41:08.719
I guess not.

41:08.826 --> 41:11.090
But a man's got to do
what a man's got to do.

41:13.664 --> 41:15.962
She's in the kitchen.

41:28.278 --> 41:29.245
Hi.

41:31.582 --> 41:33.573
Do you have another one
of these belts?

41:33.684 --> 41:35.345
They're one of a kind.

41:35.485 --> 41:37.749
Well, in that case,
I'd like to return it.

41:37.888 --> 41:40.152
- Okay.
- Well, no, not return it.

41:40.257 --> 41:42.418
Just give it back
so that you can gift wrap it

41:42.526 --> 41:44.118
and send it to a friend or mine.

41:44.228 --> 41:45.889
Okay.

41:54.605 --> 41:56.505
Hey.

41:56.607 --> 41:58.438
Hey.

41:58.542 --> 42:01.102
How's he doing?

42:01.211 --> 42:02.439
He's better.

42:04.248 --> 42:06.079
Scott said he
might not need surgery.

42:06.183 --> 42:08.481
That's good.

42:11.488 --> 42:13.615
Look, I don't know
what Mindy told you.

42:13.724 --> 42:16.693
But whatever it was,
it isn't true.

42:19.663 --> 42:21.631
What?

42:28.005 --> 42:28.869
Hey.

42:28.972 --> 42:30.530
Oh, my God.
Amy, you're famous.

42:30.641 --> 42:32.233
Look! It's your horse's ass!

42:32.342 --> 42:34.936
Oh, would you look at that?

42:35.045 --> 42:38.037
I guess I'll have to get
a couple copies or something, right?

42:38.181 --> 42:40.308
Unless, of course,
the store is still closed.

42:41.652 --> 42:44.951
Um, Mindy left something for you.

42:55.732 --> 42:57.666
Oh, my God.

43:01.605 --> 43:04.199
Here. I want you to have it.

43:05.842 --> 43:07.833
She gave it to you.

43:07.945 --> 43:08.969
And I'm giving it to you.

43:09.079 --> 43:12.981
Hey, while you girls work this out,
I'm taking it for a test-drive.

43:13.583 --> 43:16.518
Hands off my belt.

43:16.887 --> 43:18.548
Ashley!

43:21.224 --> 43:23.590
Heartland Equestrian Connection.

43:23.694 --> 43:25.423
Oh, Mindy's agent.

43:25.529 --> 43:27.554
Yeah, you know what?
Let me tell you something, Mister.

43:27.664 --> 43:30.633
I don't care what she said, 'cause...

43:31.501 --> 43:34.527
Heaven on Earth?

43:35.439 --> 43:37.737
Really?

43:38.742 --> 43:42.303
Another one of your clients?

43:44.948 --> 43:46.142
Yeah, you know what?

43:46.249 --> 43:49.844
Unfortunately, we're fully booked.

43:56.760 --> 43:59.160
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:00.597 --> 44:03.157
Hey. Look, I don't know
what Mindy told you...

44:03.266 --> 44:06.667
But whatever it was,
it wasn't true?

44:08.071 --> 44:10.403
Yeah. Well, maybe some of it wasn't.

44:10.507 --> 44:12.873
But some was. I don't know.

44:12.976 --> 44:14.637
But she said some stuff, too.

44:14.745 --> 44:16.508
Like what? What did she say?

44:17.748 --> 44:19.045
Just stuff.

44:19.850 --> 44:21.181
And let me guess.

44:21.284 --> 44:24.776
You signed
that confidentiality agreement?

44:24.888 --> 44:26.287
Yeah, something like that.

44:26.390 --> 44:27.721
Come on, Ty. Just tell me.

44:27.824 --> 44:28.984
Tell me.

44:29.092 --> 44:31.492
I wish I could, but I can't.

44:31.595 --> 44:33.722
I'm gonna get it out of you
one way or another.
