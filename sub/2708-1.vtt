Well, they forgot
This world keeps spinning

01:12.197 --> 01:14.323
And with each new day

01:15.200 --> 01:19.162
I can feel a change in everything

01:20.164 --> 01:23.791
And as the surface breaks,
reflections fade

01:24.752 --> 01:28.463
But in some ways, they remain the same

01:29.506 --> 01:33.384
And as my mind begins
to spread its wings

01:34.178 --> 01:37.889
There's no stopping curiosity

01:38.849 --> 01:42.977
I want to turn the whole thing
upside down

01:43.562 --> 01:47.940

they say just can't be found

with everyone

02:22.893 --> 02:24.769
Well, I can try

02:25.729 --> 02:29.357
And as I roll along I begin to find

02:30.400 --> 02:33.986
Things aren't always just what they seem

I want to turn the whole thing

spinning round and round

that man was able to take time
and enjoy life.

- A mountain of chocolate.

- Star stickers?
- No.

04:51.458 --> 04:56.405
Miss Dunlop, why do we have to come
to this boring museum every single week?

04:56.505 --> 04:59.908
It's not boring. It's very interesting.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.451
This led to hot dinners.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.136
- Eventually became the microwave.
- BOY: Three, two, one.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.389
Oh! Oh, no.

Hot. Fire's hot.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.894
Yes. Where was I?

05:12.229 --> 05:14.840
- Hey, is that a real spear?
- BOY: Can we play with it?

05:14.940 --> 05:18.844
Kids, a museum is a place
where we observe. We don't play.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.637
- This stinks.
- What else can we do?

05:20.737 --> 05:23.015
- Yeah, this is boring.
- MAGGIE: Children, be polite.

- Excuse me?

05:47.264 --> 05:50.334
Next Thursday, I'm going to talk
to your class about the lungfish,

05:50.434 --> 05:53.503
the closest living relative
of the tetrapods.

05:53.603 --> 05:57.299
- It's pretty great.
- I look forward to hearing it.

05:57.399 --> 06:00.093
You know, I look forward
to all your Thursday lectures.

- I mean, I know that it's Thursday.
- Don't worry.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.352
- I just meant, when it's not, I wish it was.
- It's not a big deal.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.452
Here.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.289

- Ted?
- Mr. Bloomsberry.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.136
Walk with me, Ted.

06:27.304 --> 06:31.124
I'm afraid that Ogg and Grogg,
all of our friends here,

06:31.224 --> 06:34.169
they're just not bringing in
the crowds like they used to.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.295
What do you mean?

06:35.395 --> 06:40.217
It breaks my heart, but I have
to sell the museum. We're broke.

06:40.317 --> 06:44.054
Broke? Mr. Bloomsberry,
the museum can't close!

06:44.154 --> 06:48.183
I have no choice, Ted.
Museum attendance is down.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.268
No one's buying anything
from the gift shop.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.938

06:53.038 --> 06:55.790
Even the glow-in-the-dark star stickers.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.026
Man, I love those.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.737
I especially love the Milky Way... Wait!

07:00.837 --> 07:02.739
What will happen to the museum?

07:02.839 --> 07:04.908
- Well, I'm glad you asked.
- Junior?

It'll be torn down and a
parking lot put in its place,

and no daily maximums.

07:11.515 --> 07:12.749

07:12.849 --> 07:15.810
The world doesn't need
another parking lot.

07:15.977 --> 07:19.172
The world needs a place
where kids' brains can grow.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.508
Exactly. That's why I'm thinking

07:21.608 --> 07:25.178
they can grow trying to count
all the spaces in the new parking lot.

- Well...

going to get a better offer.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.895
I know. I know.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.523
Wait. What if we did something?

07:36.623 --> 07:38.692
What if we got an amazing new exhibit?

07:38.792 --> 07:42.211
You know, Ted, you need to worry
about finding an amazing new job.

07:42.337 --> 07:45.741
- Well, hold on, Junior.
- But I was just trying... Oh, great.

07:45.841 --> 07:49.593
Ted, if you have an idea, now is
the time to speak up. What exhibit?

07:49.761 --> 07:51.079
Yes, what exhibit?

07:51.179 --> 07:53.290
- TED: It's the...
- Yes?

07:53.390 --> 07:55.751

- Yes.

- Spit it out.
- Don't be shy, Ted. Come on.

I'm sorry. "The lost..."
You lost me at, "the lost."

over a 100 years.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.816
I had all the charts ready.

08:19.916 --> 08:24.253
I was all set to go to Africa
when something happened.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.531
Slips my mind.

08:26.631 --> 08:30.577
Hello, how about the birth
of your only son? That would be me.

08:30.677 --> 08:35.414
Yes, then I began another adventure,
raising Junior.

08:35.515 --> 08:40.311
Well, now that that's done, you can
finally finish what you've started,

08:40.437 --> 08:44.424
- which is bringing home...
- Yeah! The Lost Shrine of Zagawa.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.510
You'll put this museum on the map.

08:46.610 --> 08:49.096
- I'll need a team of 10 men.
- Oh, at least 10.

You go, girl.

the Lost Shrine of Zagawa!

- A little help here.
- Hey, watch it!

09:15.388 --> 09:16.832
I forgot something.

09:16.932 --> 09:20.142
I am really, really old.

09:20.810 --> 09:24.422
Can I have the Bloomsberry Express
pull into the reality station

09:24.522 --> 09:26.842
and sign here, initial here.
Nope, not there.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.943
Wait! I guess I could go.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.055
Did I just say that? I can't do that.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.724
I don't even ride the bus.
Maybe they didn't hear me.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.393
I'm sorry, sir. You were saying?

09:36.493 --> 09:38.061
Excellent idea, Ted.

09:38.161 --> 09:39.646
He did hear me.

09:39.746 --> 09:44.234
Him? You've got to be kidding me.
Ted is not an explorer.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.570
- He raises a good point.
- Nonsense.

09:46.670 --> 09:50.157
With my maps and my journals,
a six-year-old could find the shrine.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.033
Thank you, I think.

09:52.133 --> 09:55.177
Come on. Let's get you ready
for your big adventure.

09:55.470 --> 09:58.456
Now, Ted, the journal
won't take you right to the idol.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.933
- It won't?
- No, you have to use your instincts.

10:01.059 --> 10:05.354
- About that, sir, I don't have any.
- Don't be silly. It'll be fun.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.279

01:06:45.627 --> 01:06:47.294
How'd you get out?

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:53.509
George?

01:06:54.386 --> 01:06:57.262
So that's why traffic was so bad.

01:06:57.639 --> 01:06:59.139
Oh, George.

01:07:00.892 --> 01:07:02.335
Here, give me that!

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:06.438
Those were some good times.
We had some fun, didn't we?

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:09.676
WOMAN: Thank you.

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:11.136
Without you I was broken

01:07:11.236 --> 01:07:14.697
But I'd rather be broke down
with you by my side

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:18.450
Sir, I'm only passing out
flyers, not hugs.

01:07:18.702 --> 01:07:20.994
Ted, I've been looking for you.

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:23.273
Is everything okay?

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:24.649
That's what I was thinking.

01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:26.776
- Yeah, sure. Why?
- Why?

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:31.031
Well, you are hugging a man
dressed in a monkey costume.

01:07:31.131 --> 01:07:33.215
Kind of tight, I might add.

01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:38.288
And good luck with that, Phil.
Great to see you again.

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:42.307
Yeah, you, too. Remember,
the sale ends Thursday.

01:07:43.184 --> 01:07:46.379
So after they took him away,
I've been wandering the streets,

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:49.549
and you saw me hugging a man
in a monkey outfit.

01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:51.984
That pretty much catches you up.

01:07:52.444 --> 01:07:55.430
I can't believe George is gone,
and it's all my fault.

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:56.681
Yes, it is.

01:07:56.781 --> 01:07:57.865
What?

01:07:58.032 --> 01:08:01.061
Ted, do you want me to tell you
what you want to hear,

01:08:01.161 --> 01:08:02.979
or do you want to hear
what you should hear,

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:06.915
which I'll tell you, and not just
what you think you want to hear?

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:08.735
Run that by me one more time.

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:12.880
George is gone, and I'm afraid
it's your fault he's gone.

01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:16.591
So the question is,
what are you going to do about it?

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:22.805
You're right. It is my fault.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:27.060
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a date with a monkey.

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:30.756
You know that I don't have
a date with a monkey.

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:33.426
It was just my way of saying
that I'm going after George.

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:35.319
- Ted.
- Right. Bye.

01:08:38.223 --> 01:08:39.823
(SHIP HORN BLOWING)

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:00.844
Oh, no! I'm too late.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.388
Or am I?

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:07.711
Luckily, movies have taught me
exactly what to do in this situation.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.937
Kids, don't try this at home.

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:13.899
Here we go.

01:09:23.535 --> 01:09:27.453
What am I doing?
This isn't a movie. It's real!

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.493
This is odd.

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:45.264
You guys are a little dressed up for a
cargo ship to Africa, don't you think?

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:46.974
(SHIP HORN BLOWING)

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:48.600
Oops.

01:09:49.477 --> 01:09:50.810
Excuse me.

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:53.438
I'm coming for you!

01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:05.868
George!

George!

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:30.851
Where are you?

01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:33.145
George, are you here?

01:10:34.355 --> 01:10:36.148
I think you're here.

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:37.983
George?

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:41.403
(GEORGE CHATTERING)

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:45.157
George!

01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:48.952
There you are!

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.038
Stand back, buddy!

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:58.545
George, give me a hug,
you little fur ball!

01:10:59.005 --> 01:11:01.506
There. You're all right.

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:04.468
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:09.348
I don't know how I let them
take you away. I mean, I do.

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:15.562
This was so important to me,
but somehow it just doesn't matter anymore.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:20.359
What matters is you and me,
buddy, our buddyship.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:24.305
Now we can do all the monkey things
we've always wanted to do.

01:11:24.405 --> 01:11:28.200
I'll get an organ and grind,
and you can dance for money.

01:11:28.368 --> 01:11:31.479
Or I can dance for money. Who knows?

01:11:31.579 --> 01:11:33.914
We'll figure it out. We can take turns.

01:11:34.207 --> 01:11:37.443
George, do you mind?
I'm expressing some feelings here.

01:11:37.543 --> 01:11:39.544
It's kind of hard, okay?

01:11:39.671 --> 01:11:42.673
Now, where was I?
Right, who's going to dance.

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:47.579
Oh, no, no. Adventure!
You brought adventure to my life.

01:11:47.679 --> 01:11:51.682
And now, you know,
that's all that matters.

01:11:55.979 --> 01:11:58.271
Wait. Where's that coming from?

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:00.774
It's a pictogram.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.238
George, it's the map!

01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:08.657
We had it all along.

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:11.477
Of course.

"Turn your eye to the light.
Go from blindness to sight."

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:18.625
I was supposed to hold
the statue up to the sun.

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:24.741
Pack your things, George.
We're off to Africa on the very next ship.

(SHIP HORN BLOWING)

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:29.761
Wait a minute.
We're already on a ship to Africa.

01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:32.305
Man, what a time saver.

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:42.274
Okay, Edu. I got it.

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:49.781
That's it! You did it,
George! Give me five!

01:12:51.451 --> 01:12:53.243
That's close enough.

01:12:55.038 --> 01:12:56.788
Well done, Mr. Ted.

01:12:56.914 --> 01:12:59.400
- This way, men! Follow me.
- Right away.

The guy in yellow.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.002
Let's go.

01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:18.711
Here I am.
Please, valet at your service.

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:20.937
- We've been waiting.
- Sorry.

The nearest parking lot
is five blocks away.

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:27.903
I know. I own that parking lot.
That's where the real money is.

I know.

Okay, now that, I haven't seen.

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:52.469
But now I've seen it.

As I stand in front of
the Lost Idol of Zagawa...

01:14:06.067 --> 01:14:09.402
I just have one important thing to say.

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:12.306
Anyone can memorize facts and figures.

01:14:12.406 --> 01:14:15.351
The real way to learn anything
is to go out and experience it,

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:17.812
and let your curiosity lead you.

- Hi.
- BOY: Hey, it's George.

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:22.374
So who's ready to learn?

01:14:24.919 --> 01:14:26.878

01:14:27.547 --> 01:14:30.450
- Remarkable.
- I've never seen anything like it.

You know, Timmy, I have
an original George in my penthouse.

There you are, 17-B.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.483
Boy, you're light
on your feet for a big man.

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:07.487
I must admit, your monkey
shows real talent.

01:15:07.587 --> 01:15:08.613
Quite the artist.

01:15:08.713 --> 01:15:11.157
So I am taking back
kickinging you from building.

- Oh, that's great, Ivan.
- No hard feelings.

- Right over there.
- Thanks, Mr. Bloomsberry.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:24.269
- I parked all the cars, Father.
- Good job, Son.

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:26.938
Really? A good job.

- Hug your son.

- It's okay. It's okay.
- Tighter. Yes.

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:35.947
- Daddy's here.
- Hold me.

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:39.951
Wow, George. You are so fast!

01:15:40.786 --> 01:15:42.230
What is that?

01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:47.083
I'm not one to brag,
but I call it The Magnificator.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.502
That's so cool.

01:15:49.795 --> 01:15:51.213
Say, have you seen Sparky?

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:53.491
I found a rib bone.

01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:54.951
I found a femur.

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:57.636
I found... Sparky.

01:15:57.762 --> 01:16:00.873

that because of Ted...

Sir, George, don't forget George.

01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:04.877
And George, of course.

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:07.338
We are not going anywhere.

01:16:07.438 --> 01:16:11.066
The Bloomsberry Museum is here to stay.

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:34.115
All right, all right, last question.

01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:37.243
Ted, where will you and George
go for your next adventure?

01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:40.011
The Arctic? South America? Egypt?

01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:44.792
You know, you don't need to go around
the world for a great adventure.

01:16:44.892 --> 01:16:47.920
I have a lot of things
to catch up on right here.

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.797
- Really?
- Really.

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:51.507
Mister, George is...

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:54.067
I know, he's cute. Lovable.

01:16:54.193 --> 01:16:56.486
Very cute. Very lovable.

01:16:56.696 --> 01:16:59.515
Yeah, well, he's also in that rocket.

01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:02.268
It's okay. There's no fuel in it.

01:17:02.368 --> 01:17:03.535
(RUMBLING)

01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:10.667
Clovis, you didn't put fuel
in that rocket, did you?

01:17:11.711 --> 01:17:12.877
Maybe.

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:15.907
- Oh, no.
- I see a rocket with empty fuel tanks,

01:17:16.007 --> 01:17:17.257
what am I supposed to do?

01:17:19.844 --> 01:17:21.303
George, wait!

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:23.831
- MAN: Bye.
- CLOVIS: See you, Ted.

01:17:23.931 --> 01:17:25.625
- GIRL: Look at all the smoke.
- CLOVIS: No hard feelings, huh?

01:17:25.725 --> 01:17:27.892
Careful, Ted! Hurry back!

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:32.465
Okay, but once around the Earth
and then straight home.

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:34.774
Do you hear me? Okay?
I've got plans tonight.

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:44.492
Gosh.

01:17:45.244 --> 01:17:47.480
No, no, no, George,
I'm not letting you drive.

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:48.564
Just sit back and...

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:51.484
No, George. Don't push that button.
I don't know what it does.

01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:52.860
George, don't...

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.754
Hold on, George! Oh, boy!

01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:58.324
That is a surge of adrenaline.

01:17:58.424 --> 01:18:00.133
I'm going to sleep good tonight.
