You sure you're ready for this?

00:15.932 --> 00:18.685
I was born ready.
Try to keep up.

00:18.768 --> 00:21.354
We're also ready, for the record.

00:22.980 --> 00:26.859
Welcome, ladies and lords,
to Castle Degrassi!

00:26.943 --> 00:30.572
This year's prom theme will be
One Enchanted Evening.

00:30.655 --> 00:33.783
It will be a night of magic!

00:35.243 --> 00:38.955
This prom theme promises
the perfect fairy-tale ending

00:39.039 --> 00:40.623
to our time at Degrassi.

00:44.252 --> 00:46.463
Love it! Let's see the budget.

00:46.546 --> 00:49.257
-[chuckles]
-This was all you, Goldilocks.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.592
Stop it, Chewy.

00:50.675 --> 00:52.094
I would've never thought
of the smoke bomb.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.637
Shall we rendezvous later
for some budgeting?

00:54.721 --> 00:57.557
You mean where I do the budgeting
and you watch?

00:57.640 --> 00:59.601
-Can't wait.
-Smart girl.

01:03.105 --> 01:05.690
So, how long have you
had a thing for Winston?

01:05.773 --> 01:08.526
[chuckles] What? Thing?
What? No! No thing.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.820
Come on,
you were totally flirting with him.

01:10.903 --> 01:13.406
[sighs] We're not flirting.
We're just friends.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.075
Does he know that?

01:15.908 --> 01:17.744
Sparkling soda water toast.

01:18.911 --> 01:20.037

-Do you got a second?
-Of course.

02:14.091 --> 02:16.469
A friend of mine works
at the London Academy of the Arts.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.931
They have one of the most exciting
creative writing programs in Europe.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.057
-Sounds amazing.
-[chuckles]

02:21.141 --> 02:24.644
Well, she's in town, and asked
about any outstanding students

02:24.727 --> 02:27.063
that might be a fit
for their last spot this fall.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.399

02:29.482 --> 02:31.359
-Yes, he means you, modesty boy.
-[chuckles]

02:31.443 --> 02:33.861
Have you considered any writing programs
like this for next year?

02:33.945 --> 02:35.280
No, not really.

02:35.363 --> 02:37.240
Um, I did just find out
I got into Queen's for business.

02:38.783 --> 02:41.911
I know it's last minute,
but can I set up an interview for you?

02:43.205 --> 02:45.081
Do you think I'm good enough
for a program like this?

02:45.165 --> 02:48.125
If you'd heard my recommendation,
you wouldn't be asking me that.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.627
Yes, please, set it up.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.546
I'll prep tonight. All night.

02:51.629 --> 02:52.964

02:53.715 --> 02:55.174
I will let her know.

I had no idea
Hunter had a taste for Wookiee.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.707
-Shut up, I didn't know.
-I'm not judging what you're into.

03:27.790 --> 03:30.335
I am.
Is something weird going on with Yael?

03:30.418 --> 03:34.381
Listen, if you heroes want to ask Yael
to shave her pits, be my guest.

03:34.464 --> 03:37.259
Or we can digitally groom the hair out
before it's due tonight.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.093
I don't know.
What do you think she'll say?

03:39.176 --> 03:41.304
I know what everybody else is gonna say.

It's just that Zoë said
something weird to me.

03:56.944 --> 03:58.655
She said Winston and I are flirting.

-What? No!

Uh, last night, when you two were
posting about "What's the best cookie?"

04:07.372 --> 04:09.499
He insisted oatmeal raisin. Wrong.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.793
The correct answer is gingerbread.
That's not flirting.

Raisins are an abomination."

How is that flirting?

04:16.423 --> 04:19.384
Because it goes on until 2:00 a.m.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.218
"Take that back or you're never
sharing my poutine again!"

04:21.303 --> 04:22.304
It is late-night flirting!

04:22.387 --> 04:24.597
We were talking.
I'm not allowed to talk to a guy?

04:24.681 --> 04:26.558
Have you ever seen the way you smile
when you're around him?

04:26.641 --> 04:28.643
I smile around you, too. See?

04:28.726 --> 04:31.020
Mmm, it's different.

04:31.103 --> 04:32.104
No, it's not,

04:32.188 --> 04:35.191
because you and me are just friends
and Winston and I are just friends.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.944
-Does he know that?
-I'm sure of it.

the wrong idea.

we're still rebuilding, but, um...

Go ahead.

and you're gonna do great.

Wow, thank you.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.088
Um, speaking of programs,

05:39.171 --> 05:41.466
I also have an interview
for the London Academy of the Arts,

05:41.549 --> 05:44.594
-for a creative writing program.
-You're gonna become a writer?

05:44.677 --> 05:47.138
Well, I... I already am a writer.

05:47.221 --> 05:49.474
Yes, of course. The play.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.183
What else do you have to say?

05:52.101 --> 05:53.144
I've written short stories, too.

05:53.227 --> 05:55.354
Listen, I'm not raining on your parade.

05:55.438 --> 05:58.858

to pay for convertibles

-and iPhones and--
-I know it's a hard career.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.613
Exactly. It's a very hard career. Miles?

-Do you really think you're good enough?

06:08.367 --> 06:10.787
Well, I was good enough
to get this opportunity.

06:17.710 --> 06:20.963
Hey, uh, would you guys
remove armpit hair from a photo of you?

06:21.047 --> 06:22.674
-[Frankie and Esme] Yes.
-No.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.008
But if I was a chick, yeah.

06:24.801 --> 06:25.885
It's no big deal.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.391
I'm just trying to fix Yael's armpit hair.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.909
Oh, sweet, sweet, simple boy.

06:49.992 --> 06:53.412
You could remove her blemishes,
fix her eyebrows, some contouring--

06:53.496 --> 06:55.832
Okay, slow down.
Barely looks like Yael anymore.

06:55.915 --> 06:59.794
Yeah, nobody's put a real photo
of themselves online since, like, 2005.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.714
Everyone wants to put
the best version of themselves online.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.423
Trust us. What you're doing is sweet.

07:05.174 --> 07:07.844

-Are you sure I'm good enough?
-Calm down.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.981
Tell me some of the ideas
that you're bringing. [grunts]

07:20.064 --> 07:22.942
Okay, well,
the one that I think sucks the least,

07:23.025 --> 07:25.945
it... it'd be a story about World War II,
but if they had social media then.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.572
So, you'd hear everyone's fears,

07:27.655 --> 07:29.574
and their secrets
and their unique stories.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.451
[sighs] Definitely tell that one.

07:31.534 --> 07:34.161
And relax, they're already
looking for people like you.

07:36.914 --> 07:39.166
-People like me?
-Mmm-hmm.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.044
Didn't you see it on the website?

07:43.796 --> 07:45.548
This spot is reserved
for diverse applicants.

07:45.632 --> 07:49.343
-Diverse as in a rich white guy?
-[chuckles] No, as in gay youth.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.515
Aren't you dating Tristan?

07:53.598 --> 07:56.518
Yes, but I... I date girls, too.
I mean, or I have.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.811
It doesn't matter how you identify.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.814
Your work speaks loud and clear
to your unique point of view.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.655
So, I got this shot
because I have a boyfriend,

08:08.738 --> 08:10.615
-not because I'm good.
-I didn't say that.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.825
You didn't have to.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.368
Well, my dad'll love this.

08:15.327 --> 08:17.539
-Anyway, I have class.
-Miles.

Better settle in.

You were having fun yesterday.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.805
I'm fine. Let's just get this done.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.264
Okay, well, [taps bench]

08:35.347 --> 08:36.933
don't you want to sit
where you can see the spreadsheet?

08:37.016 --> 08:39.393
-I'm comfortable on this side.
-Oh.

08:39.476 --> 08:42.689
Well, I'll come to you.
I need your help to make my column bigger.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.356
Make your column bigger?

08:44.440 --> 08:46.400
Yeah, I can never remember
where the menu is.

08:46.483 --> 08:47.610
I can't do this.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.779
What? Why?

08:49.862 --> 08:51.948
Because you ruined everything.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.033
What?

08:54.116 --> 08:55.743
I can start a new spreadsheet!

09:06.546 --> 09:08.923
Hot off the press.
The yearbook proof,

09:09.006 --> 09:10.424
expertly touched up.

09:10.507 --> 09:11.884
You, sir, are an artiste.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.469
What do you think?

09:15.722 --> 09:17.974
Why did you change everything on me?

09:18.808 --> 09:21.811
-But you look great in the picture.
-He is not wrong.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.730
So what,
I don't look great any other time?

09:23.813 --> 09:27.024
[chuckles] No one uses
real photos anymore.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.151
Besides, if I hadn't changed it,
you'd, uh...

09:31.195 --> 09:32.614
see your armpit hair.

09:34.198 --> 09:37.118
-So?
-Wait, you want armpit hair?

09:37.201 --> 09:40.412
I'm not embarrassed by it,
if that's what you're asking.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.875
If you want a real shock,
I also haven't been shaving my legs.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.376
Wow.

09:45.459 --> 09:46.669
What's the big deal?

09:46.753 --> 09:48.379
It's not like you guys
shave your pits or your legs.

09:48.462 --> 09:49.463
Yeah, but we're, um--

09:49.546 --> 09:52.008
What, boys?
So because I'm a girl, I have to do it?

09:52.091 --> 09:54.218
I just thought
that girls shaved under their arms.

09:54.301 --> 09:55.469
Why is it such a big deal?

09:55.552 --> 09:57.471
I think that what you're doing is brave.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.144
Never mind.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.689
[Zoë] See? Look at this versus this.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.150
-That, that, that.
-So that's how you win every time, hmm?

10:09.233 --> 10:13.655
Um, I regret to inform you that
I am resigning from the prom committee,

10:13.738 --> 10:14.989
effective immediately.

10:15.948 --> 10:19.535
Okay... You begged for this gig.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.997
-How could you just bail on Winston?
-He sent me a picture.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.374
-A picture of what?
-His pickle.

10:25.457 --> 10:27.084
[laughs] Who doesn't like pickles?

10:27.168 --> 10:28.502
Yeah, like, from his sandwich?

10:28.585 --> 10:30.212
Like from his pants.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.798
No!

10:31.881 --> 10:33.966
He didn't. Winston?

10:34.050 --> 10:37.469
You were right, okay?
I must have accidentally flirted with him,

10:37.553 --> 10:38.930
and I guess I got what I deserved.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.472
Whoa, no one deserves a junk pic.

10:40.556 --> 10:44.143
Yet it seems to be the cost
of being a girl these days. Barf!

10:44.226 --> 10:47.438
-Still, I thought Winston was a nice guy.
-Me, too.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.941
-That doesn't make it not harassment.
-You're right.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.609
I've been so shocked,
I didn't stop to think.

10:53.569 --> 10:55.780
I didn't consent to that photo.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.783
This isn't my fault. It's Winston's.

10:59.701 --> 11:02.995
Blake... [stutters] Mr. Mitchell.
[chuckles nervously] Sorry.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.496
He's such a fan of your work,

11:04.580 --> 11:07.416
and I must say, I was also
very impressed with your script.

11:07.499 --> 11:08.542
Sure.

11:08.625 --> 11:10.712
For something that you and your boyfriend
were in the middle of,

11:10.795 --> 11:13.630
you bring a very sensitive
outsider's insight.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.717
Well, actually,
the further I get away from that script,

11:15.800 --> 11:17.634
um, the less it really does for me.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.595
-Really?
-Sure.

11:19.678 --> 11:22.639
Um, it has the whole queer issue gimmick,

11:22.724 --> 11:24.100
but I can do better.

11:25.392 --> 11:28.562
-Sorry, gimmick?
-I'd rather not pin myself down.

11:28.645 --> 11:31.482
I see myself as the type of writer
who can tell any story.

11:31.565 --> 11:32.649
Of course.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.444
And... and what do you think
your unique point of view

11:35.527 --> 11:37.154
-can bring to those stories?
-You mean my diversity?

11:37.238 --> 11:38.865
Sure, your bisexuality--

11:38.948 --> 11:42.326
I'm not just about sex with boys,
if that's what you're saying.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.457
Look, I just... [sighs]
want to be a writer.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.086
Okay, well, let's hear some ideas.

11:54.630 --> 11:55.672
[Zig] I forgot my wallet.

11:55.757 --> 11:56.966
How many times
do I have to explain to you?

11:57.049 --> 11:59.593
Hey, tell your girlfriend,
thanks for the garbage advice.

11:59.676 --> 12:01.553
Yael was so mad
I photoshopped out her armpit hair.

12:01.637 --> 12:03.973
[both laughing]

12:04.056 --> 12:06.893
[stutters] Your girl has armpit hair?

12:06.976 --> 12:09.061
-[laughs]
-[laughs] I mean...

12:09.145 --> 12:11.647
I can see you guys are full of help.
Thanks a load.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.316
Hey. Hey, look,
we're... we're sorry, all right?

12:14.400 --> 12:16.277
Why don't you just tell her
you're not into it?

12:16.360 --> 12:18.529
-Because that will only make her more mad?
-[Tiny] It shouldn't.

12:18.612 --> 12:20.114
People can't help
what they find attractive.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.908
Yep, it's true.
Like for instance,

12:21.991 --> 12:24.994
Tiny here likes girls
who are a little muscle-y.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.413
Mmm, and Zig likes it
when their teeth are a little too big.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.331
Hey, I like what I like.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.376
Just like Tiny likes
his chemistry teacher.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.087
-You said you'd take that to the grave.
-[laughs]

12:35.171 --> 12:37.631
So, I'm allowed to just ask her
to change for me?

12:37.714 --> 12:39.967
-Yeah, of course.
-Your girl, is she cool?

12:40.051 --> 12:41.635
The coolest.

12:41.718 --> 12:44.180
Zig's right.
You should be able to talk to her

12:44.263 --> 12:45.764
and say what you like and don't like.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.606
Hey, I was gonna finish the budgeting,
but if you changed your mind--

12:54.690 --> 12:56.859
How could you do something so disgusting?

12:57.568 --> 12:58.569
Um--

12:58.652 --> 13:00.321
Fine, pretend like
you don't know what you did,

13:00.404 --> 13:02.656
but I'm not quitting prom. You are!

13:03.615 --> 13:06.327
Can we talk some place less exposed?

13:06.410 --> 13:13.334
It is so not okay to send
unsolicited pictures of... it to girls!

13:14.376 --> 13:16.128
Pictures of what?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.214
I have zero idea what you're mad about.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.424
Okay, just because
I accidentally flirted with you,

13:20.507 --> 13:22.759
does not give you the right
to send me an... [inhales sharply]

13:22.844 --> 13:24.595
A no-pants pic!

13:25.554 --> 13:27.098
Oh, God.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.558
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

13:29.641 --> 13:30.684
Oh, my... oh, my God!

13:33.062 --> 13:34.063
Oh, dear God.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.484
[grunts] That wasn't meant for you.

13:38.567 --> 13:40.277
I thought I sent it to Miles.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.238
Wait, what?

13:42.321 --> 13:44.991
It's a dumb joke we have going on,

13:45.074 --> 13:46.492
and you and I have been messaging so much,

13:46.575 --> 13:49.120
[stutters] I must've sent it to you
as a reflex.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.287
I don't get it.

13:50.371 --> 13:53.415
Well, it's... it's like,
here's a picture of a stapler.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.750
Here's a picture of a chair.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.127
Boom, here's a picture...

13:58.004 --> 13:59.130
It's, not, like, out.

13:59.213 --> 14:03.384
It's... it's hidden in, like,
a fruit bowl or a... a pack of hot dogs.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.553
[sighs] It's a really dumb guy joke

14:06.637 --> 14:08.680
and you shouldn't have been
caught in the crossfire.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.267
I am so, so, so sorry.

14:12.434 --> 14:13.435
[sighs]

14:14.561 --> 14:17.731
Wait... did you...

14:17.814 --> 14:20.192
Did you say you were flirting with me?

14:21.110 --> 14:23.320
Um, I have to go.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.827
How'd the interview go, hotshot?

14:31.828 --> 14:36.250
Oh, I think I made a case for who I am
and not just some quota.

14:37.168 --> 14:39.628
Quota?
What was the thing you were going for?

14:40.379 --> 14:43.257
Uh, Mr. Mitchell tried to get me to apply
for some diversity spot,

14:43.340 --> 14:45.176
-but I told them that's not for me.
-[Grace] Wait.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.844
Miles Hollingsworth III applied
for a diversity spot?

14:47.929 --> 14:49.096
-[scoffs]
-[chuckles]

14:49.180 --> 14:51.182
[school bell ringing]

14:55.061 --> 14:56.562
Just got a call.

14:56.645 --> 14:59.023
Sounds like that wasn't even you
at the interview.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.573
[Miles sighs]

15:07.656 --> 15:09.951
Well, I guess
I just wasn't diverse enough.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.829
I suggested you for that spot
because you have talent,

15:13.913 --> 15:15.081
not because of your diversity.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.458
Except I'm a white guy with a trust fund.
That's not that diverse.

15:17.541 --> 15:18.750
Sure, you have privilege,

15:18.834 --> 15:21.753
but there are other factors
that give you a unique perspective.

15:26.217 --> 15:29.886
Everyone... push your desks back
and line up.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.222
We're gonna try an exercise.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.476
Come on, line up.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.610
Line up shoulder to shoulder. Move up.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.491
Okay.

15:51.617 --> 15:52.743
First question.

15:53.910 --> 15:57.123
If you are able to show affection
to your romantic partner in public

15:57.206 --> 15:58.624
without fear of bullying...

15:59.791 --> 16:00.834
take a step forward.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.341
If your school holidays

16:07.424 --> 16:10.386
coincide with the religious holidays
you observe at home...

16:11.637 --> 16:12.929
take a step forward.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.851
Next question.

16:21.022 --> 16:22.231
[sighs]

16:25.359 --> 16:28.112
-I want you to shave your armpits.
-[chuckles]

16:29.696 --> 16:30.697
Wow.

16:31.698 --> 16:32.741
-Look...
-[sighs]

16:32.824 --> 16:35.452
I'm sorry I changed the picture
without asking.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.998
I talked to the yearbook guy
and resubmitted the untouched photo.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.625
I... I just feel like we should be honest
about what we like.

16:41.708 --> 16:45.129
-And you don't like armpit hair?
-I do not like armpit hair.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.797
Well, what if I do?

16:49.633 --> 16:50.676
Do you?

16:59.310 --> 17:00.644
Um, what's going on?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.314
Saving money on razors
and shave gel. [chuckles]

17:03.397 --> 17:06.233
No, it's... it's more than that.
You've been acting different.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.944
Ever since that thing
where you got that bra...

17:09.861 --> 17:11.447
I don't know, um...

17:12.448 --> 17:14.533
I felt different, I guess.

17:14.616 --> 17:18.079
And you don't want to
make out anymore and...

17:19.163 --> 17:21.248
Have you been...
You've been wearing, like, a...

17:22.416 --> 17:23.750
It's called a binder.

17:24.626 --> 17:29.048
It just makes me feel more... comfortable,
I guess.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.799
I didn't think that you noticed.

17:30.882 --> 17:33.135
I was just scared
that if I brought it up you'd dump me.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.971
-What? Why?
-So, you still want to be with me?

17:37.431 --> 17:38.515
[sighs]

17:43.812 --> 17:44.813
Yes.

17:45.981 --> 17:49.818
I just... don't really know
how I'm feeling these days.

17:49.901 --> 17:51.487
Well, that I can relate to.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.991
I'm really glad we could talk about this.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.368
[inhales sharply]

17:58.785 --> 18:02.331
Maybe we could keep talking
about this after school?

18:02.414 --> 18:04.791
Um, I... I know that
you don't like the armpit hair,

18:04.875 --> 18:07.336
but we could do the thing
that you do like?

18:07.419 --> 18:09.338
Eat sushi
while reading comics to each other?

18:09.421 --> 18:12.299
-I'll even do all my best voices.
-[chuckles]

18:14.468 --> 18:15.677
[Mr. Mitchell] Next question.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.972
If your parents have ever separated,
take a step back.

18:20.682 --> 18:21.850
[sighs]

18:23.852 --> 18:25.146
And final question.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.356
And you don't have to answer this
if you don't want to.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.775
If you have ever experienced abuse...

18:30.859 --> 18:32.444
take a step back.

18:40.076 --> 18:41.578
What, do you want me to admit
that I'm messed up?

18:41.662 --> 18:43.247
That my dad's always
been right about me? Fine.

18:43.330 --> 18:44.998
That's not what this is about, Miles.

18:45.081 --> 18:46.833
Then what's the point
of this stupid exercise?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.877
To show you the wealth of experience
that has helped you

18:48.960 --> 18:50.086
shape your unique point of view.

18:50.171 --> 18:52.631
My diverse point of view?

18:52.714 --> 18:54.466
Diverse does not mean lesser than.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.594
Then what does it matter if I'm bisexual?
Why do I need a special spot?

18:57.678 --> 19:00.096
You don't, but it's the one that exists,

19:00.181 --> 19:01.682
and you qualify for it.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.187
Your voice is underrepresented.

19:06.270 --> 19:09.064
It deserves to be heard
so it can help people.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.441
Like who?

19:11.608 --> 19:14.820
[stutters] Your writing really helped me
get past the bus crash.

19:14.903 --> 19:18.324
And you also helped
Goldi accept me and Rasha.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.409
You reached her.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.454
I did? She never told me.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.749
I related to your play,
and I'm not bi, or a white male,

19:27.833 --> 19:30.211
but I've spent a lot of time in hospitals.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.753
[school bell ringing]

19:37.968 --> 19:40.679
You're an interesting, talented,
complicated young man.

19:41.805 --> 19:42.889
You have stories to tell.

19:46.518 --> 19:47.686
Thanks, Mr. Mitchell.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.111
It could have been worse.
He could have sent it to you on purpose.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.071
I still feel like
we messed up our friendship.

19:58.154 --> 20:01.950
But maybe it's for the best
because it means no more flirting...

20:02.033 --> 20:03.327
at least.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.205
Gingerbread men with pants?

20:07.206 --> 20:09.291
"Because the opposite of no pants
is pants.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.876
I'm super sorry."

20:17.383 --> 20:19.551
Cool, see you later, Rasha. Bye!

20:25.474 --> 20:28.769
You know I would never send
any girl a junk pic,

20:28.852 --> 20:30.186
especially not you.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.148
-I like talking to you.
-I like talking to you, too.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.901
I guess that's why I got so upset.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.569
Because I didn't want that to stop.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.488
Well, now it doesn't have to, right?

20:39.571 --> 20:41.907
A guy and girl can be
just friends, right? [chuckles]

20:41.990 --> 20:44.576
Yeah, boys and girls do it all the time.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.953
Then, it's settled. Let's celebrate.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.580
[chuckles]

20:52.626 --> 20:53.752
Mmm.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.922
Oatmeal raisin's still the best.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.131
[scoffs]

20:59.215 --> 21:00.551
[chuckles]

21:03.178 --> 21:04.471
Thanks for coming over.

21:05.847 --> 21:11.770
I wanted to read you this.
It's to the interviewer that I blew up at.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.315
"I apologize for my conduct.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.444
You asked about ideas I was interested in.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.697
The truth is, I'm only starting
to figure out those ideas.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.617
All my life,
I've struggled with my own identity.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.244
Whether to be what my father wants...

21:28.995 --> 21:30.414
or rebel against it.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.792
This has left me afraid.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.002
Afraid to be labeled.

21:37.379 --> 21:40.591
Afraid to identify as bisexual.

21:43.134 --> 21:44.595
But that is a part of me...

21:46.054 --> 21:49.182
and it's one of the many ideas
I intend to explore as a writer."

21:53.562 --> 21:54.563
You mean that?

21:55.188 --> 21:56.815
The bisexual part of me...

21:58.191 --> 22:00.402
is the part that lets me love you.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.097
I suppose you heard that.

22:30.807 --> 22:31.933
I did.

22:47.323 --> 22:48.492
[sighs]
