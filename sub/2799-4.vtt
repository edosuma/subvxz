00:25.067 --> 00:27.569
Tucker's barking.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.072
Probably
another coyote

00:37.579 --> 00:38.580
What are you doing?

00:45.087 --> 00:46.588
Call the police.

00:49.091 --> 00:50.843
Do it!

00:50.884 --> 00:52.594
Okay.

01:15.117 --> 01:18.120
Freeze!

01:18.120 --> 01:19.621
I said freeze!

01:20.122 --> 01:22.624
I'm not afraid to use this

01:34.136 --> 01:35.137
Nobody move.

01:36.638 --> 01:37.639
Come on.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.646
My God.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.154
No wallet, no I.D.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.657
80.6 degrees.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.659
He's been dead around 12 hours

01:57.701 --> 01:59.661
Broken nose, broken cheekbone.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.164
Somebody worked him over
pretty good.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.669
There's a piece of his shirt
that's missing.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.673
That doesn't look like
a tear from a struggle

02:12.174 --> 02:13.175
It looks like it
got snagged on something.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.682
There's heavy foot traffic

02:20.724 --> 02:22.684
but no blood.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.686
It's got to be a body dump

02:24.728 --> 02:26.980
Could be.

02:27.022 --> 02:29.191
But why here?

02:32.194 --> 02:35.197
Dispatch didn't say
anything about another body.

02:35.239 --> 02:36.698
It's Tucker, their dog.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.700
He was found dead
with his tongue hanging out.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.702
I don't know,
I guess they must've

02:41.203 --> 02:42.204
slipped it something.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.705
I'll get its blood to Tox.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.207
The homeowner said

02:45.207 --> 02:47.209
that nothing was missing
in the house but food.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.211
They get a look at the
intruders? Yeah, the husband says

02:49.253 --> 02:50.754
they were dirty,
you know, like filthy,

02:50.796 --> 02:52.214
like they hadn't showered
in months.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.716
Didn't know if there were five
or 50 of them.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.218
Where is he?

03:09.731 --> 03:13.235
The Orionid
meteor shower.

03:13.235 --> 03:16.238
You never get a view
like this in town.

03:16.238 --> 03:20.242
Hm. So, uh, is this part
of the investigation?

03:20.284 --> 03:23.537
No. But we're here,

03:23.579 --> 03:26.748
and it's beautiful.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.250
Footprints-

03:28.250 --> 03:30.502
going in both directions.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.754
They came and they went.

03:32.754 --> 03:36.508
So dump the body,
raid the refrigerator.

03:36.550 --> 03:40.262
Maybe they had
an appetite for murder.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.276
? Who... are you??

03:54.276 --> 03:57.029
? Who, who, who, who??

03:57.070 --> 03:59.781
? Who... are you??

03:59.781 --> 04:01.783
? Who, who, who, who??

04:01.825 --> 04:04.077
? I really wanna know?

04:04.119 --> 04:06.288
? Who... are you??

04:06.288 --> 04:08.290
? Oh-oh-oh?
? Who...?

04:08.290 --> 04:11.793
? Come on, tell me who are you,
you, you?

04:11.835 --> 04:14.796
? Oh, you!?

04:27.809 --> 04:29.311
Well, it's no secret
how they got in.

04:29.353 --> 04:31.772
Whoa.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.316
Looks like somebody
had a Super Bowl party in here.

04:34.358 --> 04:36.318
They had som e kind of part y.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.278
Suspect made a mess.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.323
Seems like they were looking
for junk food.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.829
Somebody had sticky fingers.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.840
It's a big desert.

04:57.881 --> 05:00.300
About 25,000 square miles.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.094
And the nearest
town is Pahrump.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.846
That's about 30 miles from here.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.098
But I got water.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.308
We can share.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.853
Who are you today, Moses?

05:14.356 --> 05:17.359
Yeah, Jim, uh...

05:17.860 --> 05:22.364
Grissom and I are going
to take a little walk.

05:22.406 --> 05:23.824
Hey, Doc.

05:23.866 --> 05:24.867
Hi, there, Nick.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.326
I've lost count as to

05:26.368 --> 05:28.871
how many broken bones
this guy has.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.373
Multiple fractures
to the spine, ribs,

05:31.874 --> 05:33.834
pelvis, skull.

05:33.876 --> 05:35.627
Multiple lacerations
and contusions.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.379
No vital response
to the injuries.

05:37.421 --> 05:38.380
Perimortem

05:38.422 --> 05:39.339
Yep.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.341
He was dum ped in a backy ard

05:41.383 --> 05:42.843
by a whole bunch
of other people.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.887
Do you think they could've
beat him to death?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.889
Nick, it took a lot of people
to do this.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.432
Dirty dozen.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.394
I count five

06:34.436 --> 06:36.939
distinct treads:
Boots...

06:36.980 --> 06:38.899
shoes, sneakers.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.442
Drag marks are always
right in the middl e-

06:40.943 --> 06:41.902
thin, parallel lines.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.946
The vic's shoes were
scuffed at the toes.

06:43.987 --> 06:47.199
So, he must've been dragged.

06:56.959 --> 07:00.462
Well, whoever they are,
they like junk food.

07:02.464 --> 07:03.966
Who doesn't?

07:05.968 --> 07:08.470
ds? You ever s een the pyrami

07:08.512 --> 07:09.972
Does the Luxor count?

07:10.013 --> 07:11.473
What do you think?

07:11.974 --> 07:13.433
k.
I haven't even been to New Yor

07:13.475 --> 07:15.477
I'd like to see the pyramids
one day.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.479
Keep walking,
we could come upon them today.

07:19.982 --> 07:21.483
So you like
archaeology, huh?

07:21.525 --> 07:22.943
Oh, yeah.

07:22.985 --> 07:24.987
Whenever I want to feel small.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.492
Smoke?

07:51.513 --> 07:54.516
I found the point of ignition.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.020
Molotov.

08:07.029 --> 08:08.530
You hear that?

08:12.534 --> 08:14.995
Sounds like a motor.

08:15.037 --> 08:17.039
Think someone's in there

08:42.563 --> 08:45.567
This looks like
some sort of observation post.

08:45.609 --> 08:50.572
Maybe used to monitor
nuclear tests.

08:50.614 --> 08:55.577
Half of Nevada
was a weapons site.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.079
Stop.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.081
You're not going any further
without backup.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.585
Catherine,
where the hell are you guys?

09:04.086 --> 09:05.087
That's a good question, Jim.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.088
I think we're about

09:06.588 --> 09:09.341
three miles northeast
of the Copeland house.

09:09.383 --> 09:12.094
In front of some kind
of military installation.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.346
Hello, Catherine.
Jim, can you hear me?

09:14.388 --> 09:16.598
I'm losing...
You're breaking up. Jim?

09:16.640 --> 09:18.100
Catherine...

09:18.141 --> 09:19.560
Lost him.

09:19.601 --> 09:22.104
Well, we got two choices:

09:22.145 --> 09:24.106
Go back...

09:24.147 --> 09:26.108
or go forward.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.629
I don't hear any
thing but the generator.

09:52.634 --> 09:55.137
After you.

10:03.645 --> 10:08.650
Las Vegas Crime Lab!

10:08.692 --> 10:12.654
Anyone here?

11:51.253 --> 11:54.256
I count 11.

11:54.756 --> 11:57.259
Me, too.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.262
They're so young.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.267
And number 12 is missing.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.769
Maybe that was the guy
we found in the yard.

12:09.771 --> 12:12.274
Who's there?!

12:14.776 --> 12:15.777
Las Vegas Crime Lab!

12:17.779 --> 12:18.280
Identify yourself!

12:21.283 --> 12:22.284
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

12:22.784 --> 12:23.744
LVPD.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.245
Captain Brass radio'd us.

12:25.287 --> 12:26.788
Said you might be in here
and need assistance.

12:27.289 --> 12:30.792
Well, unfortunately, we're
notthe ones who need the help.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.299
Hey!

13:21.301 --> 13:22.261
Hey, Nick.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.804
How many we looking at, Doc? 11 total.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.806
And it's hot.
You got to move.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.307
Okay.

13:27.808 --> 13:30.310
Yeah, 80 feet underground,
with no A/C.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.312
Thought I was going
to suffocate.

13:32.813 --> 13:35.816
I'm not even going down there-
I'm claustrophobic.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.776
Yeah.

13:37.818 --> 13:42.823
Listen, uh, I did,
uh... a preliminary sketch here.

13:42.865 --> 13:43.824
It's, uh

14:12.352 --> 14:15.355
Just keep on going

14:29.870 --> 14:31.830
Oh, man.

14:31.872 --> 14:35.334
What is this place,
a mini Jonestown?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.878
I don't know if th
ey drank spiked Kool-Aid,

14:37.920 --> 14:39.880
but they drank
something.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.340
Smells like alcohol.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.383
I'll process
the bottles.

17:13.534 --> 17:14.535
oes Well, I've matched the sh

17:15.035 --> 17:15.993
from all the bodies
in the bunker

17:16.036 --> 17:19.039
to the impressions that
we found on the scene.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.040
You got one extra.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.542
It's a size
eight athletic shoe.

17:22.584 --> 17:24.002
I can't acco
unt for it.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.546
It doesn't belong to the guy
who was dumped there,

17:26.046 --> 17:28.549
and I've already ruled out
Mr. and Mrs. Copeland.

17:28.590 --> 17:31.343
So one of the people
that dragged that body

17:31.385 --> 17:34.054
through the desert
did not die in the bunker.

17:40.561 --> 17:43.063
The mythology here
appears to be similar

17:43.105 --> 17:45.566
to the Heaven's Gate cult
in California

17:45.607 --> 17:46.567
several years ago.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.319
They committed
mass suicide to shed

17:49.361 --> 17:51.530
their earthly bodies
and hitch a ride

17:51.572 --> 17:55.576
on a spaceship hidden in
the tail of the Hale-Bopp comet.

17:55.617 --> 17:58.078
Well, these earthly bodies got
a good workout first.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.623
Big room, big bed,
light show...

18:01.665 --> 18:04.126
This cult
was about getting laid.

18:04.168 --> 18:06.587
Well, Jim Jones
and Charles Manson

18:07.087 --> 18:08.589
used sex to manipulate
their followers.

18:09.089 --> 18:12.050
I'm guessing
they were timing

18:12.092 --> 18:15.596
their ascension to the Orionid
meteor shower last night.

18:15.637 --> 18:19.099
So while you were watching
shooting stars, they were dying.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.101
There's 12 bunks in there,
one bed in here.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.102
There should be 13 bodies.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.896
One prophet,

18:23.937 --> 18:25.606
12 apostles.

18:27.608 --> 18:29.568
And two people are missing.

18:29.610 --> 18:31.612
Maybe they caught the spaceship.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.574
Well..

18:35.616 --> 18:38.619
would you settle
for a flying saucer?

19:45.686 --> 19:47.187
VIN plate on the burnt-out car

19:47.229 --> 19:48.647
came back
to a Vivian Bentley.

19:48.689 --> 19:51.692
She died two years ago
at the ripe old age of 90.

19:51.733 --> 19:52.693
Car was never
re-registered.

19:52.734 --> 19:53.986
Dead end.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.153
Not exactly.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.698
I also found a melted name tag
with a sunburst logo.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.700
Figured I'd let my fingers
do the walking.

19:59.741 --> 20:00.742
You scanned the
Yellow Pages.

20:00.742 --> 20:01.660
I knew the first
three letters.

20:01.702 --> 20:03.203
By the way, do you know
how many companies

20:03.245 --> 20:05.205
in Las Vegas
start with S-U-N?

20:05.247 --> 20:07.166
I so don't care.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.710
Well, only one has
the sunburst logo:

20:09.751 --> 20:11.670
Sunview Travel Agency.

20:11.712 --> 20:14.214
Vivian's grandson,
Ty Bentley, works there.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.716
I pulled his DMV photo.

20:17.718 --> 20:20.220
That's the guy that
was dumped at the house.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.180
Brass is going
to check it out.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.681
How are we doing
on the other I.D.s?

20:22.723 --> 20:24.725
Including the one that
you just made, we got one.

20:27.728 --> 20:29.229
Ty hasn't been here
for the last two days.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.231
Didn't even call in.

20:31.273 --> 20:32.232
This is his desk.

20:33.734 --> 20:35.736
It's really not like him

20:35.777 --> 20:37.196
Is he okay?

20:37.237 --> 20:38.697
Does Ty work h
ere full-time?

20:38.739 --> 20:41.700
Yeah. Puts in more hours
than anybody.

20:41.742 --> 20:43.243
Was he a member of any
religious organizations

20:43.285 --> 20:44.203
that you know of?

20:44.244 --> 20:47.498
I don't know.
It never really came up.

20:47.539 --> 20:50.751
Something happened to him,
didn't it?

20:52.753 --> 20:53.712
Yeah.

20:53.754 --> 20:57.216
So the last time you saw
him was two days ago?

20:57.257 --> 21:00.260
He's worked here over a year,
never raised his voice.

21:00.761 --> 21:03.764
Then this strange-looking
customer came in.

21:03.805 --> 21:05.766
Ty must've known him...

21:06.266 --> 21:10.270
I want to talk to Emma, you freak!

21:10.771 --> 21:13.273
She's moving on, boy.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.277
Would that customer's
information

21:17.319 --> 21:18.278
still be i n the computer?

21:18.779 --> 21:21.031
Nobody's touched it since.

21:21.073 --> 21:23.283
Should be
the last entry

21:27.788 --> 21:30.290
Do you know the person in this photo?

21:30.332 --> 21:32.751
That's Emma, Ty's girlfriend.

21:32.793 --> 21:36.296
Well, ex-girlfriend.
They broke up last year.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.257
Here we go

21:38.298 --> 21:41.802
Last customer was
a Joseph Diamond.

21:41.844 --> 21:45.305
Booking a trip t o Australia. Sydney.

21:45.806 --> 21:46.306
One way.

21:46.807 --> 21:49.810
One way.

21:51.812 --> 21:52.813
Any good news, Mandy?

21:52.855 --> 21:54.273
A little bit.

21:54.314 --> 21:55.816
A male d. b. at the bunker
matched your partial

21:55.858 --> 21:56.817
from the kitchen door.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.319
So far, he's the only one
with a record.

21:59.820 --> 22:02.322
Matthew Dickens, 19.

22:02.823 --> 22:03.323
Busts for petty theft.

22:03.824 --> 22:04.783
College student.

22:04.825 --> 22:06.076
Yeah, very impressionable.

22:06.118 --> 22:07.286
When I start my religion,

22:07.327 --> 22:09.329
that's where
I'm going to recruit.

22:11.832 --> 22:13.834
I remember him. Matt Dickens.

22:13.876 --> 22:15.794
We called him Hollywood.

22:15.836 --> 22:17.337
He was in our, u h, our freshman dorm.

22:17.379 --> 22:18.297
He was a...

22:18.338 --> 22:19.298
Religious Studies major.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.341
Right.
Hard-core Trekkie, too.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.302
Mars bars.
Right.

22:23.343 --> 22:24.845
That dude loved
junk food.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.347
He smoked a ton of weed.
Guy was a loser.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.350
What do you mean?

22:32.853 --> 22:34.855
His parents sent him
loads of cash.

22:34.897 --> 22:35.814
He spent it all on dope,

22:35.856 --> 22:37.816
and then he stole stuff
to get more dope.

22:37.858 --> 22:39.359
According to the registrar,
he was taking classes

22:39.401 --> 22:41.820
till the end of term,
last fall.

22:41.862 --> 22:43.322
Why did he leave?
He started hanging out

22:43.363 --> 22:45.866
with some other losers, and
they convinced him to drop out.

22:45.908 --> 22:47.868
Yeah, there was a redhead.

22:47.910 --> 22:48.827
She was hot.

22:48.869 --> 22:51.371
But in a... in a weird kind of way.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.831
Hollywood was a moron.

22:52.873 --> 22:54.374
One week, the guy's
saving the whales,

22:54.416 --> 22:55.876
and the next week,
he's American Taliban.

22:55.918 --> 22:57.377
Yeah. He was totally
into that girl.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.378
She have a name?

22:58.879 --> 23:00.339
Emma.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.882
Was this her?

23:03.884 --> 23:05.844
Is she dead?

23:05.886 --> 23:06.887
They're all dead.

23:11.391 --> 23:14.394
Emma was working Hollywood
with some old guy named Diamond.

23:14.895 --> 23:15.854
Working him?

23:15.896 --> 23:16.855
Yeah, they
were running

23:16.897 --> 23:18.398
some kind of
religious scam

23:18.899 --> 23:21.401
Emma tried to recruit me...
with her hands down my pants.

23:21.443 --> 23:22.402
She did that to me, too.

23:24.404 --> 23:24.905
No kidding?

23:25.405 --> 23:25.906
Yeah.

23:27.908 --> 23:29.368
Anyway, uh,

23:29.409 --> 23:30.869
the second she started talking

23:30.911 --> 23:32.371
about outer spac e and transcendence,

23:32.412 --> 23:34.414
I blew her off, 'cause
I do not waste time

23:34.456 --> 23:35.374
on crazy chicks.

23:35.415 --> 23:36.917
She was really hot,
though.

23:38.418 --> 23:39.878
That was almost
a year ago.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.421
And then, the last time
I saw Hollywood,

23:41.922 --> 23:42.923
he was with some other freak.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.425
A notch down, though.
Abbey...

23:45.467 --> 23:47.386
I think her name was.

23:47.427 --> 23:48.929
They said they were going
to some better place.

23:48.971 --> 23:51.431
I thought they meant UCLA.

23:59.231 --> 24:01.233
Nick, I got a real low
signal, you're cutting in and out.

24:01.733 --> 24:02.192
Say that again.

24:02.234 --> 24:03.694
I said all the prints

24:03.735 --> 24:05.737
on the bottles
belong to the victims.

24:06.238 --> 24:08.240
The prints on the funnel
came back unknown though.

24:08.282 --> 24:10.242
And what about the blood
in the elevator shaft?

24:10.284 --> 24:11.201
It matched to Ty Bentley,

24:11.243 --> 24:12.995
but we can't confirm
he was murdered.

24:13.036 --> 24:14.705
For all we know,
he fell down that shaft.

24:14.746 --> 24:17.249
No, that's unlikely.
After all, they torched his car,

24:17.749 --> 24:18.750
dragged his body three miles

24:19.251 --> 24:21.503
and dumped it
in the Copelands' backyard

24:21.545 --> 24:23.380
Anything on the liquid
in the bottles?

24:23.422 --> 24:25.257
Yeah, Tox results
just came back:

24:25.299 --> 24:27.217
40 grams percent ethanol.

24:27.259 --> 24:28.260
Now, that's about 80 proof

24:28.760 --> 24:30.262
Kind of smelled like vodka-
the cheap stuff.

24:30.304 --> 24:31.263
Nobody dies from a martini.

24:31.305 --> 24:32.723
No,

24:32.764 --> 24:34.766
but you add ten grams percent
of Ketamine and they do.

24:34.808 --> 24:36.727
Well, that's enough
to kill a horse.

24:36.768 --> 24:38.770
Yeah, or the Copelands' dog,
for that matter.

24:38.812 --> 24:40.772
Ketamine's a disassociative
anesthetic,

24:40.814 --> 24:42.774
which means
they were hallucinating,

24:42.816 --> 24:44.776
having out-of-body
experiences...

24:45.277 --> 24:47.279
So I was wrong;
they did take a trip.

24:47.321 --> 24:49.281
Well, there are
a lot of different ways

24:49.323 --> 24:50.782
they could have killed
themselves,

24:50.824 --> 24:52.242
so I'm guessing
that was the point.

24:52.284 --> 24:57.789
Ten grams percent of Ketamine
times 12 bottles, that's..

24:58.290 --> 25:00.751
300 milliliters of Ketamine?

25:00.792 --> 25:02.252
Can't score that on the street

25:02.294 --> 25:03.795
Well, we didn't find
any ephedrine,

25:04.296 --> 25:06.798
which is generally used
to cut Ketamine.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.301
Veterinarians use
liquid injectable Ketamine

25:09.343 --> 25:10.302
as an animal sedative,

25:10.802 --> 25:12.304
so Sophia's checking
with the local vets now.

25:12.346 --> 25:14.306
What did autopsy say
time of death was?

25:14.348 --> 25:15.766
3:15 a. m.?

25:15.807 --> 25:17.309
Between 3:00 and 3:30.

25:17.809 --> 25:18.769
How did you know that?

25:18.810 --> 25:20.812
That's when
the Orionid meteor shower

25:20.854 --> 25:21.813
passed over Vegas.

25:22.314 --> 25:24.316
Ask him if they all died
about the same time.

25:24.358 --> 25:26.818
Nick, was TOD same for everyone?

25:26.860 --> 25:28.278
Approximately.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.780
It varied with body weight.

25:29.821 --> 25:31.323
Took between 12 and 20 minutes
for 'em to die.

25:34.827 --> 25:37.329
Ketamine's really
hard on the stomach.

25:37.371 --> 25:38.330
It induces vomiting.

25:40.833 --> 25:43.836
I think a combination
of alcohol and the drug

25:43.877 --> 25:44.837
just slowed their lungs.

25:52.344 --> 25:55.848
Ultimately, they died
of respiratory arrest.

25:55.889 --> 25:56.849
Okay, thanks, Nicky.

25:57.349 --> 25:59.309
Got to go.

25:59.351 --> 26:02.855
Did you notice
those buzzards earlier?

26:02.896 --> 26:04.815
No.

26:04.857 --> 26:07.359
But something sure
smells good to them.

26:13.365 --> 26:14.366
Say "ah."

26:14.408 --> 26:15.367
Ah.

26:15.409 --> 26:16.410
Ahh...

26:16.451 --> 26:17.327
Ahh.

26:17.369 --> 26:20.330
Sore throat, you say?

26:20.372 --> 26:24.376
Okay, I don't see
any inflammation.

26:24.877 --> 26:26.378
Take off your shirt, please.

26:30.382 --> 26:31.884
Can't we just make out?

26:44.396 --> 26:47.399
I'm working, Mr. Brown.

26:47.441 --> 26:50.402
I don't care, Mrs. Brown

26:58.911 --> 27:01.163
There's nothing wrong with you

27:01.205 --> 27:03.290
You're just working too hard

27:03.332 --> 27:05.417
What time you get off shift?

27:05.459 --> 27:07.169
Midnight. You?

27:07.211 --> 27:08.921
Who knows.

27:13.926 --> 27:15.928
I got to get back to work.

27:33.445 --> 27:34.947
Don't even say it, Warrick

27:34.988 --> 27:36.448
I didn't say anything.

27:36.490 --> 27:37.908
You got to admit though,

27:37.950 --> 27:39.451
working around the ex is
a little strange.

27:39.952 --> 27:41.453
It was a long time ago.

27:41.495 --> 27:43.205
It was a year ago.

27:43.247 --> 27:44.957
You have to trust me.

27:45.457 --> 27:46.959
I do trust you.

27:47.459 --> 27:48.418
But there's still so much

27:48.460 --> 27:50.462
that we don't know
about each other yet.

27:50.504 --> 27:52.923
Okay?

27:52.965 --> 27:55.968
But we got the rest
of our lives to figure it out.

28:13.485 --> 28:15.946
Are you having the same mirage
I'm having?

28:15.988 --> 28:18.490
A silver Beemer in the middle
of the damn desert?

28:18.532 --> 28:19.950
Yeah.

28:19.992 --> 28:22.953
Nice wheels.

28:22.995 --> 28:26.498
Somebody sure went out of
their way to hide this car.

28:26.999 --> 28:30.002
Well, you can sure smell
what the buzzards are after.

28:30.043 --> 28:31.503
Decomp.

28:46.018 --> 28:48.020
Fits the description
of the leader, Joseph Diamond.

28:48.061 --> 28:50.022
Guess he never made it
to Australia.

28:50.522 --> 28:53.025
Something tells me
this wasn't a suicide.

28:56.028 --> 28:58.489
Like this tire iron.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.282
Convenient weapon of choice.

29:00.324 --> 29:01.992
Well, assuming this is Diamond

29:02.034 --> 29:04.286
and Ty Bentley was
a spurned lover

29:04.328 --> 29:06.163
and not a member
of the cult...

29:06.205 --> 29:07.998
we're still short one body

29:08.040 --> 29:11.543
Which I believe makes that body
our number one suspect.

30:39.631 --> 30:42.634
"Thank you for writing; your
father and I miss you so much. "

30:44.136 --> 30:46.597
I hope this helps.
Send more when I can. "

30:46.638 --> 30:49.600
"Mom and Dad went to the police
to report you missing.

30:49.641 --> 30:52.144
"I don't understand what
you're doing with your life.

30:52.186 --> 30:54.646
Your roommate says
you left your things behind. "

30:56.148 --> 30:58.150
"I wish you could tell me
why you need this money. "

30:58.192 --> 30:59.651
"Mom says you joined a commune.

30:59.693 --> 31:00.652
"She's mad.

31:01.153 --> 31:03.113
"Dad sent the money.

31:03.155 --> 31:05.657
"No more money until
I hear from you.

31:05.699 --> 31:07.659
I love you. "

31:11.663 --> 31:14.166
The FBI keeps tabs
on high-risk groups,

31:14.208 --> 31:16.126
cults,
religious fanatics

31:16.168 --> 31:18.170
They were good eno
ugh to fax this over.

31:18.670 --> 31:19.671
Makes good reading

31:22.174 --> 31:25.177
"Joseph Diamond,
a.k.a. Sirus Bent,

31:25.677 --> 31:27.137
a.k.a. Kelvin Adams... "

31:27.179 --> 31:30.682
Yeah, he founded a group called
"Soul Salvation,"

31:30.724 --> 31:32.684
in Tulsa, in the mid-'90s.

31:33.185 --> 31:34.144
A few years later,

31:34.186 --> 31:36.188
same thing in
Guadalajara, Mexico.

31:36.688 --> 31:38.190
"Recruited susceptible youths,

31:38.690 --> 31:40.943
keeping them isolated
for nine months to a year. "

31:40.984 --> 31:43.195
Yeah, prior to the arrival
of the mother ship,

31:43.237 --> 31:45.197
which they can only enter
in spirit form,

31:45.239 --> 31:46.698
leaving their temporal vehicles,

31:46.740 --> 31:48.200
their bodies, behind.

31:48.242 --> 31:49.660
Mass suicide.

31:49.701 --> 31:50.702
Attempted mass suicide.

31:51.203 --> 31:53.705
They woke up-
probably with a hangover-

31:53.747 --> 31:56.208
and both Diamond
and their money were gone.

31:56.708 --> 31:58.168
And in both cases,

31:58.210 --> 32:01.713
his disappearance coincided
with a meteor shower,

32:01.755 --> 32:03.215
just like the one last night.

32:03.715 --> 32:06.468
Only last night, everybody died.

32:06.510 --> 32:09.179
Depressed fracture.

32:09.221 --> 32:10.722
Well, we found a tire iron
at the scene.

32:10.764 --> 32:12.474
That would do it.

32:12.516 --> 32:14.184
What about TOD

32:14.226 --> 32:15.686
Well, it's hard to say.

32:15.727 --> 32:17.187
Desert heat,
locked in a trunk...

32:17.229 --> 32:19.982
Both can make liver temp
actually rise.

32:20.023 --> 32:22.359
What about relative
to the other bodies?

32:22.401 --> 32:24.570
Did he die before
or after the others?

32:24.611 --> 32:26.697
Given the degree
of decomp,

32:26.738 --> 32:28.240
it appears that he died
before the others.

32:28.282 --> 32:30.701
I can run some chemical tests,

32:30.742 --> 32:32.244
but that's gonna take
some time.

32:34.246 --> 32:34.746
What's this?

32:40.752 --> 32:42.254
Hmm, looks like a money belt.

32:43.755 --> 32:47.259
Gives new meaning
to "strapped for cash.

32:47.759 --> 32:48.719
Diamond was running
a cash business.

32:48.760 --> 32:52.264
He had all those kids
write home and ask for money.

32:52.306 --> 32:55.767
His return address was
a P.O. box downtown.

32:55.809 --> 32:57.269
I didn't find
any undigested pills

32:57.769 --> 32:58.270
in the victims' stomachs.

32:58.770 --> 32:59.730
We assumed that

32:59.771 --> 33:01.273
they were ingesting
a liquid Ketamine.

33:01.315 --> 33:03.275
So what are these?

33:03.317 --> 33:04.234
Zolpidem.

33:04.276 --> 33:06.278
Popped one
when I went to Europe.

33:06.778 --> 33:08.280
Six hours sleep,
no hangover.

33:09.781 --> 33:11.783
Are there enough pills in
that bag to kill 11 people

33:11.825 --> 33:13.785
Well, if only one person
downed all these,

33:13.827 --> 33:14.786
yes, it'd be lethal.

33:14.828 --> 33:15.787
But divvied up, no way.

33:16.288 --> 33:17.247
Zolpidem's a pretty safe
sedative.

33:17.289 --> 33:19.291
n, And from what we kno
w, Diamond was a con ma

33:19.333 --> 33:20.751
not a murderer

33:20.792 --> 33:23.295
Hey, I lifted a partial
off that tire iron.

33:23.337 --> 33:24.755
Matched it to a print

33:24.796 --> 33:26.798
that Nick lifted off
the funnel from the bunker.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.800
Whoever whacked Diamond mixed
the Ketamine cocktail.

33:29.301 --> 33:31.803
So who brought the Ketamine
to the party?

33:39.311 --> 33:41.313
They had a break-in
the day before yesterday.

33:41.355 --> 33:42.773
Has it been forensicated?

33:42.814 --> 33:45.067
Not yet.
Not much stolen, so...

33:45.108 --> 33:47.319
SI. It's a low priority for C

33:47.361 --> 33:48.320
Expensive equipment,

33:48.821 --> 33:49.822
pharmaceuticals-
doctor even had

33:50.322 --> 33:51.281
his laptop open
on the desk.

33:51.323 --> 33:53.826
They obviously knew
what they wanted.

33:53.867 --> 33:55.577
Mm, and where
to look for it

33:55.619 --> 33:57.329
Drugs have been
alphabetized.

33:57.371 --> 33:59.289
Missing drug was

33:59.331 --> 34:01.834
between Ivermectin
Otic Suspension

34:02.334 --> 34:03.335
and Methocarbamol.

34:03.377 --> 34:04.336
"K" for Ketamine.

34:04.837 --> 34:06.338
Yeah. They took it all.

34:06.839 --> 34:08.297
Okay, well, it's
probably an inside job

34:08.340 --> 34:11.342
Just get me a list of current
and former employees, and we'll

34:11.385 --> 34:12.844
go from there. Thanks.

34:14.847 --> 34:16.849
Wow, it's alphabetized.

34:18.851 --> 34:20.310
Now what are you doing

34:20.351 --> 34:22.353
You'll be dusting for prints.

34:22.396 --> 34:23.355
I'll help.

34:24.356 --> 34:26.358
Okay.

34:45.878 --> 34:47.337
That's Emma.

34:47.379 --> 34:49.882
That's our daughter.

35:09.902 --> 35:11.361
Excuse me, sir.

35:11.403 --> 35:14.406
Mrs. Spencer
isn't here

35:14.907 --> 35:16.909
Her daughter went to
college with Emma.

35:17.409 --> 35:18.911
They disappear ed at the same time.

35:19.411 --> 35:20.913
Uh, we both
received letters

35:20.954 --> 35:21.914
from them last month.

35:23.415 --> 35:24.917
Spencer, you said?

35:25.417 --> 35:27.377
Her daughter's name was Abigail.

35:27.419 --> 35:30.422
Well, ma'am, you see,
the letters that we recovered

35:30.464 --> 35:31.381
were damaged.

35:31.423 --> 35:32.883
Not all of them yielded a name.

35:32.925 --> 35:36.428
Well, perhaps she was luckier
than me.

35:39.932 --> 35:40.891
Ma'am...

35:40.933 --> 35:44.436
would you be able
to identify Abigail?

35:46.939 --> 35:49.441
Absolutely

35:55.447 --> 35:59.952
Nick, you have that employee
list from the vet's office?

36:01.453 --> 36:02.955
The prints found
at the clinic break-in

36:02.996 --> 36:04.456
are a perfect match
to the ones lifted

36:04.957 --> 36:07.960
off the tire iron
and the funnel.

36:08.001 --> 36:08.919
Abigail Spencer.

36:08.961 --> 36:10.420
She was a cult member.

36:10.462 --> 36:12.464
She used to work for your vet
until last year,

36:12.506 --> 36:13.966
and she's missing.

36:14.007 --> 36:15.467
Her W-2's in the file.

36:15.509 --> 36:16.969
I'll call Brass.

36:18.470 --> 36:20.472
Mrs. Spencer?

36:20.514 --> 36:21.431
Yes?

36:21.473 --> 36:23.475
I'm Detective Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police.

36:23.976 --> 36:25.477
Do you have a daughter
named Abigail?

36:25.519 --> 36:27.938
Yes. Why?

36:27.980 --> 36:29.982
We have a warrant
to search these premises.

36:30.023 --> 36:30.983
A warrant? What for?

36:31.483 --> 36:31.984
Your daughter is wanted

36:32.484 --> 36:32.985
for questioning
in the murder

36:33.485 --> 36:34.444
of Joseph Diamond.

36:34.486 --> 36:36.989
I haven't seen Abigail
in almost a year.

36:37.489 --> 36:38.490
I have no idea where she is

36:44.496 --> 36:47.499
The bed's still warm.
Where is she?

37:36.548 --> 37:39.551
Take me with you.

38:20.592 --> 38:24.096
Freeze! Remain where you are.

38:40.612 --> 38:42.114
Abigail?

38:44.116 --> 38:47.119
You pumped my stomach?

38:47.161 --> 38:50.122
Yeah. Just in time.

38:58.630 --> 39:01.133
Are you disappointed?

39:02.134 --> 39:05.596
They're all up
there right now.

39:05.637 --> 39:10.142
Rapture- a higher
plane of existence

39:11.643 --> 39:17.149
No wars, poverty,
no politics.

39:20.152 --> 39:22.154
Our bodies are
just shells.

39:22.196 --> 39:24.615
They're worthless.

39:24.656 --> 39:28.660
Well, how come you didn't die
with your friends?

39:29.161 --> 39:32.664
And why, exactly,
did you kill Mr. Diamond?

39:34.666 --> 39:38.670
He was the most beautiful person
I ever met.

39:55.687 --> 39:58.190
We found your fingerprint
on a tire iron

39:58.232 --> 40:00.692
that was used
to split his head open.

40:01.693 --> 40:05.155
He always said we'd be tested.

40:05.197 --> 40:08.200
I was taking a walk
when I spotted a car

40:08.242 --> 40:11.203
parking about a mile away
from the compound.

40:11.245 --> 40:12.454
Whose car is this?

40:12.496 --> 40:13.664
Where have you been?

40:13.705 --> 40:16.208
I received a message last night
from the Orionid.

40:16.708 --> 40:17.960
I have to move on,

40:18.001 --> 40:19.336
spread the word.

40:19.378 --> 40:20.671
What about us?

40:20.712 --> 40:22.172
Come with me, Abbey.

40:22.214 --> 40:24.216
We'll do it together

40:24.258 --> 40:26.218
somewhere near a beach

40:28.220 --> 40:31.723
We're ascending tomorrow night
to the mother ship.

40:31.765 --> 40:34.184
You're a smart girl.

40:34.226 --> 40:36.728
Just two or three of these,
and everyone will get

40:36.770 --> 40:38.730
a real good night's sleep.

40:38.772 --> 40:40.691
Time to get
out of town.

40:40.732 --> 40:42.234
Everyone's parents h
ave been really good to me

40:42.734 --> 40:45.696
I got 40 grand

40:45.737 --> 40:48.740
I knew the others
would be looking to me now.

40:48.782 --> 40:50.742
But you didn't tell them,
did you?

40:50.784 --> 40:53.245
We were on a schedule.

40:53.745 --> 40:55.247
And fortunately, you knew
where to find something

40:55.289 --> 40:57.249
a little stronger
than Zolpidem.

40:58.250 --> 41:01.753
It was important
that no one suffered.

41:01.795 --> 41:04.256
Ty Bentley suffered.

41:04.298 --> 41:06.717
That was unfortunate.

41:06.758 --> 41:09.761
Ty must've followed Diamond
back to our compound.

41:10.262 --> 41:14.266
I'm sure he was looking
for his ex-girlfriend, Emma.

41:14.308 --> 41:15.767
These people are freaks, Emma!

41:15.809 --> 41:16.768
You're coming with me!

41:16.810 --> 41:17.769
This is my family now.

41:19.271 --> 41:22.774
Fine. I'm coming back, and I'’
bringing the cops with me.

41:30.782 --> 41:33.285
Emma lost it, said we couldn't

41:33.327 --> 41:35.746
leave his body there.

41:35.787 --> 41:37.789
The others started
to get restless.

41:37.831 --> 41:38.749
And, as you said,

41:38.790 --> 41:40.250
you were on a schedule.

41:40.292 --> 41:42.294
Peak of the meteor shower
was 3:00 a. m.

41:46.298 --> 41:49.801
We agreed to dump the body
where it would be found...

41:49.843 --> 41:51.803
given a decent burial.

41:51.845 --> 41:53.847
And then you went back

41:53.847 --> 41:55.807
to the compound...

41:56.308 --> 41:57.768
and you used the funnel

41:57.809 --> 41:59.811
to distribute the Ketamine
and vodka.

42:11.824 --> 42:14.827
I had to be the last to drink.

42:16.328 --> 42:18.831
Did you watch them all die?

42:20.833 --> 42:23.335
What was it like?

42:50.362 --> 42:53.365
They just died.

42:53.866 --> 42:56.869
And you went home
to your mother.

42:56.910 --> 43:00.873
I know they're all up there.

43:00.914 --> 43:04.877
happy... healthy... perfect.

43:10.382 --> 43:14.386
You don't believe we're al
one in the universe...?

43:14.428 --> 43:17.347
Abigail...

43:17.389 --> 43:20.392
I'm sure if there is somethi
ng out there,

43:20.434 --> 43:21.852
looking down on us

43:21.894 --> 43:23.896
from somewhere else
in the universe,

43:24.396 --> 43:28.901
they're wise enough
to stay away from us.
