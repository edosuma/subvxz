WEBVTT

00:06.841 --> 00:09.423
Ijust could not get
a cab out in the parish.

00:09.552 --> 00:11.543
No running. Slow down.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.887
Your wife explained all that
when she rescheduled your appointment.

00:15.016 --> 00:17.758
My wife? Yeah, I bet she did.

00:17.894 --> 00:20.510
I appreciate you taking the time again
out of your busy day,

00:20.646 --> 00:24.355
but the thing is, l gig a lot.
And sometimes I'm out on the road.

00:24.483 --> 00:27.020
I'm putting together my own band
and, you know...

00:27.153 --> 00:29.394
So I don't know if I'm exactly
what you're looking for.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.738
I mean, my own band, brah.
You know that'll have to take precedence.

00:32.867 --> 00:34.323
I understand.

00:34.452 --> 00:36.192
When y'all start working
with the marching?

00:36.329 --> 00:37.444
No time soon.

00:37.580 --> 00:40.617
No uniforms, no instruments.

00:40.750 --> 00:44.538
Man, see, I had it in mind to be
working with a marching band.

00:44.670 --> 00:48.413
That'll come eventually. To start,
there's three band classes a day, with me.

00:48.549 --> 00:51.256
Three? That's a lot.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.548
With my schedule,
maybe you can make this a part—time gig.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.672
You know... You know,
you really need somebody full—time.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.344
I can give you some names, yeah.

00:59.477 --> 01:01.763
We can make it work.
Just let me know in advance.

01:01.896 --> 01:04.387
The papenNork says
you can start immediately.

01:04.523 --> 01:07.265
Immediately? You mean, like today?

01:07.401 --> 01:09.312
The principal's already signed off on it.

01:09.445 --> 01:11.356
Oh, thanks.

01:11.489 --> 01:13.480
You know about my criminal history, right?

01:13.616 --> 01:15.777
Misdemeanors or felony?

01:15.910 --> 01:18.777
Misdemeanors,
but, you know, it...

01:18.913 --> 01:20.574
(Children shouting)

01:23.251 --> 01:25.867
Class, everybody, settle down!

01:26.003 --> 01:29.996
Markeas, Markell. That's our new sousaphone
right there, son, ain't no toy.

01:30.132 --> 01:32.748
Chevonne, this is not a beauty parlor.

01:34.136 --> 01:35.717
OK, band, take your seats.

01:35.846 --> 01:39.839
Listen up. Everybody please welcome
our new assistant band director,

01:39.976 --> 01:42.183
Mr. Antoine Batiste.

01:42.311 --> 01:45.098
(Snapping fingers)

01:47.525 --> 01:48.935
What's with the...

01:49.068 --> 01:51.901
Classroom management technique,
helps with the talking.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.815
How come most of them
don't have no horns?

01:53.948 --> 01:57.611
— The instruments a—comin' program.
— Huh. Tipitina Foundation, uh?

01:57.743 --> 01:59.699
Supposed to be sending us
instruments any day,

01:59.829 --> 02:01.740
but until then we work
on reading rhythms.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.908
Here we go, band. Ready?

02:04.041 --> 02:06.657
One, two, three, four.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.627
(Clapping rhythmically)

03:46.060 --> 03:49.973
— (Drum machine playing)
— (lmitates trumpet)

03:50.106 --> 03:52.563
That's the hook. Repeat twice, then the bridge.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.898
Then my flow. (Clears throat)

03:55.027 --> 03:57.143
J‘ Four years at Radcliffe,
that's all you know

03:57.279 --> 03:59.144
J‘ A desire to do good and a 4.0

03:59.281 --> 04:01.897
J‘ You're here to save us
from our plight

04:02.034 --> 04:04.116
J‘ You got the answer
'cause you're rich and white

04:04.245 --> 04:06.452
J‘ On a two—year sojourn here to stay

04:06.580 --> 04:08.741
J‘ Teach For America all the way

04:08.874 --> 04:11.206
J‘ Got no idea what you're facing

04:11.335 --> 04:12.996
J‘ No clue just who you're displacing

04:13.129 --> 04:15.336
J‘ Old lady taught fathers,
old lady taught sons

04:15.464 --> 04:17.329
J‘ Old lady bought books
for the little ones

04:17.466 --> 04:19.957
J‘ Old lady put in 30 years

04:20.094 --> 04:22.255
J‘ Sweat and toil, time and tears

04:22.388 --> 04:24.174
J‘ Was that really your sad intention

04:24.306 --> 04:26.922
J‘ Help the state of Louisiana
deny her pension? J‘

04:27.059 --> 04:28.048
Hell to the no.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.301
— Turn it off.
— What?

04:30.438 --> 04:33.851
For one thing, it was the state of Louisiana
who fired all those teachers,

04:33.983 --> 04:36.850
- not Teach For America.
— A scab is a scab is a scab, OK?

04:36.986 --> 04:39.523
Track three of my hip—hop opus addresses

04:39.655 --> 04:41.987
the hidden social costs
of educational reform.

04:42.116 --> 04:44.232
Davis, we're white guys.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.778
Deal with it.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.823
Dude, work in progress.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.790
Yeah, fucking cops went
buck wild for nothing.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.170
I mean, we was in there
trying to get food and water

04:55.296 --> 04:57.628
to keep from fucking dying out that bitch.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.587
Cops come in hollering about,

04:59.717 --> 05:03.130
"Get out! All y'all get your ass out!"

05:03.262 --> 05:05.674
People are looking like,
"Man, we're trying to survive."

05:05.806 --> 05:07.512
You know what I mean?

05:07.641 --> 05:12.260
Then theyjust went to going upside
motherfuckers' heads like it wasn't no thing.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.057
Cops went inside the store?

05:14.190 --> 05:16.021
And they were beating people?

05:16.150 --> 05:17.686
Man, inside, outside,

05:17.818 --> 05:20.525
chasing them down the street.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.236
Did you see, uh, this young man that day?

05:25.117 --> 05:27.108
I mean, it was pandemonium up in there.

05:27.244 --> 05:30.031
You know what I mean? No lights,
motherfuckers fighting over shit,

05:30.164 --> 05:32.746
cops kicking people.
It was crazy.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.786
You recognize any of
the officers involved?

05:34.919 --> 05:36.955
No, man. Shit.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.918
They look familiar?

05:39.048 --> 05:40.584
Looked like cops.

05:40.716 --> 05:41.876
Black, white?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.510
Some of both, OK?

05:43.636 --> 05:46.878
This is the First District. You can practically
see the station house from here.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.130
Were they First District?

05:49.266 --> 05:51.177
If I have some more questions,
can I contact you?

05:51.310 --> 05:52.675
You got a number
I can reach you at?

05:52.811 --> 05:55.018
Look, I'm not testifying
about no police.

05:55.147 --> 05:57.058
Nobody's asking you
to testify about anything.

05:57.191 --> 06:00.399
You remember that cop
that kicked that man to death in Treme

06:00.528 --> 06:03.770
in broad daylight about
a month before the storm

06:03.906 --> 06:05.567
in front of witnesses?

06:05.699 --> 06:07.906
Yeah, he's still around.

06:08.035 --> 06:12.620
Yeah, well, we're just trying to find out
what happened to this young man.

06:12.748 --> 06:14.864
Somebody shot him.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.956
I didn't hear no shots.

06:18.087 --> 06:19.748
(Bell tolling)

06:22.925 --> 06:24.881
— This is last year's suit?
- (Albert) Mm-hm.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.420
The beadwork is gorgeous.

06:26.554 --> 06:30.138
A lot of them younger Indians, they can't even
much make a suit without a hot-glue gun.

06:30.266 --> 06:33.099
I use one myself when I need to
for the trim and such,

06:33.227 --> 06:35.218
but everything else I sew.

06:35.354 --> 06:39.097
Sylvester at the Backstreet told me
you were an old-time Indian.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.393
Feel this.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.359
Feel how hard they are.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.946
That's how you can tell
who sews and who don't.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.657
See, that's the kind of insight I need,

06:50.786 --> 06:52.367
exactly what I'm looking for.

06:52.496 --> 06:55.454
My film is all about rebuilding,
the city and the culture.

06:55.583 --> 06:56.993
And you're doing both.

06:57.126 --> 06:59.412
Now, see, you cannot film me

06:59.545 --> 07:01.501
while I'm working on my
housewarming new suit.

07:01.630 --> 07:02.915
May I ask why not?

07:03.048 --> 07:05.209
You're gonna have to wait till I come out
on carnival day.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.958
I don't reveal myself no sooner,
no later, no nothing.

07:08.095 --> 07:11.758
You come around Mardi Gras,
take pictures in the street, get in line.

07:11.890 --> 07:15.098
I'm interested in the process,
not the result.

07:15.227 --> 07:18.560
The process don't matter
if you don't have no result.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.809
Process? Shit.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.808
The process is just
a lot of damn hard work.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.435
Don't say no now.
Think it over.

07:26.572 --> 07:28.563
I don't need to.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.858
Now I got some of that
hard work to do.

07:33.329 --> 07:36.662
You can find me at the Backstreet
if you change your mind.

07:45.299 --> 07:48.166
(J‘ Joe Oliver & Jelly Roll Morton:
Tom Cat Blues)

07:48.302 --> 07:51.544
Man, Tom Cat Blues.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.636
Don't this shit sound
like two motherfuckers

07:53.766 --> 07:56.223
profiling with their brims
and shit on the corner?

07:56.352 --> 07:58.217
Two old motherfuckers.

07:58.354 --> 08:00.811
I just can't see anybody
listening to this,

08:00.939 --> 08:02.645
not this century.

08:02.775 --> 08:04.640
See now, that's fucked up.

08:04.777 --> 08:06.233
You take a classical orchestra,

08:06.362 --> 08:08.648
anything from Bach to Stravinsky,

08:08.781 --> 08:10.191
300 years of music,

08:10.324 --> 08:12.906
it's standard repertoire, right?

08:13.035 --> 08:15.401
But in jazz, Jelly Roll Morton

08:15.537 --> 08:17.277
is considered prehistoric.

08:17.414 --> 08:22.204
Well, he sounds prehistoric to me.
I'm sorry, Del. I'm just not hearing it.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.577
Listening to this,
I just see brothers

08:24.713 --> 08:26.578
toting barges and lifting bales.

08:26.715 --> 08:29.001
What? No.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.631
Listen, this here was popular music...

08:33.764 --> 08:36.255
Jelly Roll and King Oliver and Pops.

08:37.351 --> 08:40.434
I'm just trying to figure out
what elements made this music

08:40.562 --> 08:43.224
so popular back in the day,
you know?

08:43.357 --> 08:45.723
This is what I want to capture.

08:52.616 --> 08:55.949
Davis, I don't know the slightest thing
about the music business.

08:56.078 --> 08:59.036
I do. I'm thinking we start with a sampler,

08:59.164 --> 09:01.120
seven or eight artists,
two tracks an artist,

09:01.250 --> 09:03.286
a couple of local rappers,
a couple of bounce artists,

09:03.419 --> 09:05.375
a funk band or two,
then my thing.

09:05.504 --> 09:07.085
Your thing?

09:07.214 --> 09:08.670
"When worlds collide."

09:08.799 --> 09:12.337
I'm gonna put a straight funk rhythm section
together but then drop some brass on top,

09:12.469 --> 09:15.711
then throw a little hip—hop flow into it,
kinda, uh...

09:16.515 --> 09:19.006
Galactic has its way
with the Hot 8's front line

09:19.143 --> 09:21.259
before sleeping around
with Lil Wayne.

09:21.395 --> 09:24.979
Trust me, I'm gonna take New Orleans music
where it's never gone before.

09:25.107 --> 09:26.813
So we start a record label

09:26.942 --> 09:29.149
and we put out a...a sampler.

09:29.278 --> 09:32.816
Funk, bounce, New Orleans
hardcore and nasty, yes, yes.

09:32.948 --> 09:35.280
And you yourself are gonna be

09:35.409 --> 09:37.866
one of these hardcore nasties?

09:37.995 --> 09:42.705
I mean, you, my little uptown,
Newman—educated nephew?

09:42.833 --> 09:45.950
Do not mock the sad circumstances
of my birth.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.795
In my soul I'm a 22—year—old thug
from the Magnolia,

09:49.923 --> 09:52.460
twirling G—packs and cutting motherfuckers
with my flow.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.629
I'm pure pale nastiness.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.424
So back up off me, bitch.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.550
(Sighs)

10:02.102 --> 10:03.933
How much would I be in for?

10:04.062 --> 10:05.438
Your stake, 5,000.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.100
$5,000?

10:07.232 --> 10:08.847
With your money and my vision

10:08.984 --> 10:10.975
we cannot help but become

10:11.111 --> 10:14.695
the big, sleazy reincarnation
of Def Jam records.

10:16.950 --> 10:21.034
(Sighs) I must be out of my fucking mind.

10:21.163 --> 10:23.745
I gotta go by there tomorrow after work
before rehearsal.

10:23.874 --> 10:26.331
I got presents for the boys I need to drop off.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.496
"After work."
I like the sound of that.

10:28.629 --> 10:31.587
— How's she doing?
- Uh...

10:31.715 --> 10:33.580
said she's better.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.423
I don't know.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.089
Didn't sound all that good.

10:39.890 --> 10:43.303
Oh, breaded pork chops
and butter beans.

10:43.435 --> 10:46.347
- Mm-hm.
— You always know what I need.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.347
Keep that job, Antoine.
That's what I need.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.098
I know this ain't been no easy thing,

10:51.235 --> 10:53.351
but it's the only way
we're getting out of here.

10:53.487 --> 10:54.693
Gigging just ain't doing it.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.483
And you know something else?

10:56.615 --> 10:57.980
You can do this.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.278
(He sighs)

11:01.411 --> 11:06.246
(Woman) Crazy ass.
Talk about when it's gonna be over.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.536
Miss LaDee?

11:08.669 --> 11:12.082
(Woman) Shit. I never did lied about it.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.123
Sorry, John. I...

11:16.260 --> 11:18.421
forgot where I was for a minute. I...

11:20.013 --> 11:21.844
I was someplace else.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.302
I gotta get out of here, me.

11:36.071 --> 11:38.107
Let me walk you to your car.

11:43.954 --> 11:46.036
J‘ It's gonna be a really long one

11:46.498 --> 11:48.489
J‘ It's gonna be another long one

11:48.625 --> 11:52.914
J‘ It's gonna be
another long one

11:54.965 --> 12:00.301
J‘ Tonight J‘

12:03.640 --> 12:04.925
(Cheering)

12:10.856 --> 12:13.017
Thank you. Thank you.

12:14.151 --> 12:17.268
It's so good to be here.
Thank you very much.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.020
You know, last night
I was on Frenchmen Street

12:20.157 --> 12:22.990
and I heard a fiddle player
that just totally knocked me out.

12:23.118 --> 12:26.281
And I've asked her to come
and give me a hand on this next tune.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.449
So will you please welcome

12:28.582 --> 12:31.039
New Orleans' own Annie Tee?

12:31.168 --> 12:33.159
(Cheering and applause)

12:53.482 --> 12:56.849
J‘ There are things I will do

12:56.985 --> 12:59.647
J‘ For a hatchetjob too

12:59.780 --> 13:00.735
J‘ Ante up

13:00.864 --> 13:05.233
J‘ There's a new kid in town

13:05.369 --> 13:08.736
J‘ But it won't take long

13:08.872 --> 13:11.705
J‘ For what's red—hot and blonde

13:11.833 --> 13:13.664
J‘ To be ashes

13:13.794 --> 13:17.457
J‘ On the ground

13:17.589 --> 13:21.377
J‘ And the Manhattan skyline

13:21.510 --> 13:23.842
J‘ A bed and a byline

13:23.971 --> 13:29.261
J‘ Well, I've come and I've cradled your face

13:30.102 --> 13:33.344
J‘ And I won't be the last one

13:33.480 --> 13:36.472
J‘ To commit crimes of passion

13:36.608 --> 13:38.348
J‘ With a shoot—out

13:38.485 --> 13:42.444
J‘ And a chase

13:42.572 --> 13:45.939
J‘ Mm—mm, over and over

13:46.076 --> 13:49.068
J‘ And over and over

13:49.204 --> 13:52.116
J‘ Beckoning, begging

13:52.249 --> 13:54.535
J‘ I keep hanging on

13:54.668 --> 13:57.535
J‘ Going once, going twice

13:57.671 --> 14:00.663
J‘ Mercy God, Jesus Christ

14:00.799 --> 14:03.711
J‘ And I'm gone and I'm gone

14:03.844 --> 14:06.711
J‘ I'm gone... J‘

14:06.847 --> 14:08.838
(J‘ Blues music playing)

14:36.710 --> 14:39.076
All right, all right.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.203
— Not bad. Nicejob.
— Thanks.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.130
You're available which nights?

14:44.259 --> 14:47.342
Well, all of them. I need steady work.

14:47.471 --> 14:49.553
All right.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.467
I'll get your number.
Give me a minute.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.556
Cool.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.600
— Uh...
— He ain't no Freddie Green, but he'll do.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.944
— Might be better out there.
- True that.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.906
Speaking of which, Cornell,
what happened to Raymond?

15:09.034 --> 15:12.071
You know Ray got a steady gig
with Dumpstaphunk, man.

15:12.204 --> 15:16.243
Oh, man, we ain't even popped our cherry
and cats alreadyjumping ship.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.990
Say, brah, are you gonna have enough time
to learn the arrangements?

15:19.127 --> 15:21.038
Arrangements?
You doing a symphony?

15:21.171 --> 15:23.412
How about I hit on two and four
and you shut the fuck up?

15:23.548 --> 15:25.925
- (Both) Ooh.
— Oh, all right, Herman.

15:26.051 --> 15:28.337
I heard you were
a contrary motherfucker.

15:28.470 --> 15:29.755
(Laughter)

15:45.237 --> 15:48.070
Hey, girl, you killed that tune.

15:48.198 --> 15:49.233
Thank you.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.402
It was such an honor to play with you.
I had a blast.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.366
It was great.
I was happy to have you.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.611
Listen, there's somebody
who needs to meet you.

15:55.747 --> 15:57.362
Come here.

16:00.669 --> 16:03.536
— Marvin. Marvin.
- Hey.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.583
Hey, I want you to meet Annie.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.501
Annie, this is Marvin Frey.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.091
— You were good up there.
— Thank you.

16:10.220 --> 16:11.335
You were great.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.553
Oh, I see Shannon,
so I'm gonna go say hi to her.

16:13.682 --> 16:16.139
— It's good to see you.
— You too, darling.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.681
Uh, so how do you know Shawn?

16:20.814 --> 16:23.681
She's a friend.
She's my neighbor in Austin.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.729
And what do you do?

16:26.862 --> 16:28.727
I'm a manager.

16:28.864 --> 16:32.823
I rep a bunch of
up—and—coming artists in Austin.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.534
Oh shit. This is awkward.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.278
I didn't ask her to do that. I...

16:38.415 --> 16:40.952
Don't worry about it.
Shawn's just like that.

16:41.084 --> 16:43.416
She gets excited about new talent.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.370
And... And you don't?

16:47.424 --> 16:50.712
Actually, I do.
That's why I'm here scouting.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.134
So who represents you?

16:54.848 --> 16:56.839
I guess that's the next step.

16:57.767 --> 17:01.510
Well, I'm sure you'll find somebody suitable
when the time's right,

17:02.564 --> 17:04.395
when you're ready.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.639
Right.

17:07.068 --> 17:12.313
Uh, listen, we're gonna go to Rio's place,
One Eyed Jacks. Why don't you come?

17:12.449 --> 17:14.110
You would dress the place up.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.575
It's been a long day already.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.114
Thank you, though.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.993
Good luck.

17:28.757 --> 17:30.042
One more time,

17:30.175 --> 17:32.712
how many beats
does a half—note get?

17:33.303 --> 17:35.419
- (Girl) Two beats.
— (Snapping fingers)

17:35.555 --> 17:37.466
Mr. Batiste, could you please write

17:37.599 --> 17:40.215
two measures in 4/4 time
on the board, please?

17:43.146 --> 17:44.431
(Thunder crashes)

17:52.364 --> 17:54.229
Mr. Lecoeur, are we safe?

17:54.366 --> 17:56.652
Sounded like that was inside.

17:56.785 --> 18:00.369
This isn't Katrina.
It's just a thunderstorm. Just be calm.

18:00.497 --> 18:02.704
Mr. Batiste.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.706
(Davis muttering)

18:16.179 --> 18:18.420
Aunt Mimi, what... what is this?

18:18.556 --> 18:22.014
"For profit definition,
consult rider A in appendix 3."

18:22.143 --> 18:24.395
Rider A. What?

18:24.521 --> 18:26.512
— Standard boilerplate.
- (Thunder rumbles)

18:26.648 --> 18:28.513
Oh, Davis, just sign the damn paper

18:28.650 --> 18:30.982
so we can open this bottle already.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.851
Boilerplate? Huh?

18:32.988 --> 18:37.277
Look, Charles just wants to get everything
down on paper to protect us both.

18:37.409 --> 18:38.649
Don't you, Charles?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.821
Very much so.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.239
(Mimi sighs)

18:42.372 --> 18:45.114
(Thunder rumbles)

18:51.506 --> 18:54.088
— (Cork pops)
— And away we go.

18:58.013 --> 19:02.632
(Man) See, I went to the Mint Museum
and they had a little Indian suit

19:02.767 --> 19:05.509
way back in the corner
with no name on it.

19:05.645 --> 19:09.103
So I said to myself,
"If I ever open a museum,

19:09.232 --> 19:14.852
"I'm—a take and put the people's name on it
and what tribe the suit come from."

19:14.988 --> 19:16.569
(Albert) Mm. Mm—hm.

19:16.698 --> 19:21.158
I'd love to film all the Indian suits you have

19:22.203 --> 19:25.331
with you explaining each one

19:27.000 --> 19:30.242
and what style it is —
uptown, downtown.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.878
You know, there's more to Indians
than just suits.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.543
Enlighten me.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.882
The work we do in the community —

19:38.011 --> 19:39.751
Chief Howard teaching the kids to sew.

19:39.888 --> 19:43.176
You know, Jerome Smith
over at Tambourine and Fan,

19:43.308 --> 19:45.799
now he's been running
a summer camp going on...

19:45.935 --> 19:47.891
— what, about 40 years now?
- About 40 years.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.478
Forty years, passing on the tradition.

19:50.607 --> 19:53.269
Maybe you could be my liaison,

19:53.401 --> 19:54.516
be in the film too.

19:54.652 --> 19:57.359
Sylvester can do that.
You don't need me.

19:57.489 --> 20:00.981
I thought maybe you reconsidered
and that's why you came down here.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.982
(Sighs)

20:03.119 --> 20:04.950
I felt bad about yesterday.

20:06.039 --> 20:09.873
I don't want you to go away thinking
that all New Orleans people was rude.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.832
I am, but I ain't typical.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.167
I know you're not.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.912
I'm from here, you know.
New Orleans east.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.631
See, she's reallyjust
learning about Indians.

20:18.760 --> 20:19.920
Oh.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.135
My family, they didn't approve of the Indians.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.639
Uh—huh, uh—huh.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.380
I tell you what,

20:25.517 --> 20:27.974
you call me after Mardi Gras

20:28.103 --> 20:29.764
and then we'll talk.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.807
Can I film you Mardi Gras day?

20:31.940 --> 20:34.477
Shit, you're gonna have to film me, girl.

20:34.609 --> 20:36.190
I'm gonna be the prettiest.

20:36.319 --> 20:37.729
- (Laughs)
— Sylvester.

20:37.862 --> 20:38.977
All right.

20:42.158 --> 20:45.571
Father said to thank you.
He didn't expect another check.

20:45.703 --> 20:49.787
That's what it's all about -
reconstruction, renewal, development.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.578
Exactly right. That's the task in front of us.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.122
I've got half a million
debris and demolition dollars

20:55.255 --> 20:58.213
sitting in my brand—new Southeast Louisiana
Bank and Trust account.

20:58.341 --> 21:00.878
I'm ready to take it
to the next level, Clete,

21:01.010 --> 21:02.716
get those cranes on the horizon,

21:02.846 --> 21:04.677
make some real money.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.262
Nelson, I tell you what,

21:06.391 --> 21:08.723
let's sit down after the holidays.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.717
You understand what I'm saying?

21:11.479 --> 21:15.063
Oh, sure. I'm sorry,
I'm just anxious to get started.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.231
Merry Christmas.

21:19.487 --> 21:20.567
(Clete) Hm.

21:23.283 --> 21:25.990
My grandfather had a pearl rosary.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.861
I'd sit and watch him say his Hail Marys
and Our Fathers.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.868
Thank you. Thank you very much.

21:34.043 --> 21:35.999
What are you doing
for Christmas Eve?

21:36.129 --> 21:38.415
Come over to the house.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.664
I have a dinner date, but thank you.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.712
Come after.
Join us for Midnight Mass, St. Mary's.

21:45.054 --> 21:48.012
As long as we're in church,
I got a confession to make.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.052
Well, this is the place to do it.

21:50.185 --> 21:53.143
I haven't been to Midnight Mass
since I was 17.

21:53.271 --> 21:55.603
- My family.
— I thought they were devout.

21:55.732 --> 21:59.224
Oh, they are. My family's been in San Antonio
for generations,

21:59.360 --> 22:01.612
never gone anywhere,
never got anywhere,

22:01.738 --> 22:04.024
never done anything.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.990
I'm the first in my family to go to college,

22:07.118 --> 22:10.451
the first to vote Republican
and the last one up on Sunday morning.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.154
I don't know, I just...

22:15.251 --> 22:18.414
I'd look at my dad and my abuelo,
my grandfather,

22:18.546 --> 22:20.161
and their lives...

22:21.633 --> 22:23.498
It just stopped working for me.

22:24.719 --> 22:27.335
Well, doubt is part of faith too.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.674
You don't have to take communion.
You don't have to make confession.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.552
Just be my guest,
meet my family, hm?

22:35.688 --> 22:37.269
Worship with us.

22:39.484 --> 22:41.224
I'd be honored.

22:41.361 --> 22:42.476
And bring your date.

22:42.612 --> 22:44.944
Oh, I know she's not devout.

22:45.073 --> 22:48.156
— (Chuckles) No fun preaching to the choir.
— Ah.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.326
Oh, damn, LaDonna,

22:52.455 --> 22:54.491
they really did a number on you.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.160
It's gone down a lot.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.704
Should have seen me
a few days ago.

22:59.587 --> 23:01.748
You hear from the detective?

23:01.881 --> 23:04.213
Not since I talked to her
at the hospital.

23:05.093 --> 23:07.505
I hope you're not planning to be here alone
at night no more.

23:07.637 --> 23:10.128
No, I got John working nights now.

23:10.265 --> 23:11.254
That's good.

23:11.391 --> 23:14.428
And I'm thinking about hiring a security guard
for New Year's Eve.

23:14.561 --> 23:17.018
So you're going ahead
with the live music?

23:17.146 --> 23:20.104
I am not going to let this stop me, Antoine.

23:20.233 --> 23:21.723
No, baby, but...

23:21.859 --> 23:23.440
You ever get your shit together,

23:23.570 --> 23:25.106
I'll give your band a tryout,

23:25.238 --> 23:27.103
see if you can fill a room.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.696
(Laughs)

23:30.201 --> 23:32.317
What are you calling it?

23:32.453 --> 23:36.446
Antoine Batiste And His Soul Apostles.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.039
Apostles?

23:38.167 --> 23:39.873
Hm.

23:40.003 --> 23:42.210
Modest as usual.

23:42.338 --> 23:45.045
Thank you for getting these
to the boys for me.

23:45.174 --> 23:48.462
- (Man) Right away, Chef.
— Ooh, apocalypse now, baby.

23:48.595 --> 23:52.053
Never get off the boat.
Never get off the boat.

23:52.181 --> 23:55.093
— Ijust want to fucking cook, man.
— What do you think you're doing?

23:55.226 --> 23:58.718
No, this ain't cooking. This is survival.
This is turn and burn. This is...

23:58.855 --> 24:01.642
I don't know what this is,
but this ain't cooking.

24:04.861 --> 24:07.398
(Saucier) You got my foie for me?
I'm dying for it.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.361
(Man) Foie coming right up, Chef.

24:09.490 --> 24:12.732
(Brulard) Ladies and gentlemen, listen up.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.825
We have a critic in the house.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.991
Do not fuck this up.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.160
Amuse for table 23, please,

24:20.293 --> 24:23.126
three people, ultra ultra VIP.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.836
Break out the osetra.
And don't be fucking shy with it.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.956
This is a big tuna.

24:28.926 --> 24:30.382
(Mouthing)

24:32.639 --> 24:34.049
Oh man.

24:34.182 --> 24:37.549
It's your friend, that guy who wrote
the article, Alan Richman.

24:37.685 --> 24:39.516
- No way.
— Yes way.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.762
He's sitting right out there at table 23.

26:00.101 --> 26:02.387
(Band cheering)

26:02.520 --> 26:04.226
— God damn.
— (Antoine) Motherfucker.

26:04.355 --> 26:06.892
June Yamagishi, motherfucker.

26:07.024 --> 26:09.481
What, you're here just fucking with me,
to break my heart?

26:09.610 --> 26:11.601
No, Batiste. Iwant the gig, brah.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.399
Oh yeah? For true?

26:13.531 --> 26:15.442
Are you gonna be here
tomorrow night, our debut?

26:15.575 --> 26:18.442
- I'd be honored.
— Oh no, man, I would be honored.

26:18.578 --> 26:20.034
No, I would.

26:20.163 --> 26:22.905
— No, Iwould be honored, brah.
— Man, come on.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.952
What's it with these Japanese cats?
You always gotta have the last word.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.291
- Shit.
—(Laughs)

26:27.420 --> 26:29.160
What else you got, man?

26:29.297 --> 26:31.538
Well, let's see, uh...
Remember this one?

26:35.094 --> 26:36.595
J‘ Love and happiness...

26:36.721 --> 26:38.632
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.756
— J‘ We||... J‘
— Come on now. Come on now.

26:40.892 --> 26:45.386
J‘ Make you want to do wrong,
make you do right

26:45.521 --> 26:47.261
J‘ Hey

26:48.649 --> 26:51.812
J‘ Yeah

26:51.944 --> 26:56.062
J‘ Love... J‘

26:56.199 --> 26:59.282
Watch out, Batiste.
Come on now.

26:59.410 --> 27:01.446
(Laughs)

27:07.460 --> 27:08.950
Yeah.

27:09.086 --> 27:11.213
J‘ Love and happiness... J‘

27:11.714 --> 27:13.420
(Woman) One salmon, one pigeon.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.835
(Man) Yes, Chef.

27:19.180 --> 27:21.762
Oh, he keeps looking at me.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.756
At you or through you?
There's a difference.

27:23.893 --> 27:25.599
At me. He's been doing it all night.

27:27.522 --> 27:29.729
He's doing it again.
He's doing it now.

27:29.857 --> 27:32.564
Fuck me. At me.
Definitely at me.

27:32.693 --> 27:36.026
I don't need this.
I really don't need this, not tonight.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.362
Pick up the foie
on the 12—top now, please.

27:38.491 --> 27:40.823
Foie for the 12—top, Chef, yes.

27:43.079 --> 27:44.990
Again. He's doing it again.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.374
Oh yeah, that's the look.
You're right. You're right.

27:47.500 --> 27:51.118
That's the one. Oh shit.
Here he comes.

28:12.066 --> 28:16.981
This is what the inside of your head
looks like right now.

28:31.502 --> 28:34.869
— What are you doing?
— Sorry, man.

28:38.926 --> 28:40.917
(Piano music playing)

28:47.560 --> 28:49.846
Sazerac, please, now.

28:49.979 --> 28:51.435
Is this for you or the chef?

28:51.564 --> 28:52.929
Me.

28:53.816 --> 28:56.899
And do it the right way,
absinthe, just coat the glass.

28:59.280 --> 29:02.898
(Jelly Roll Morton on radio) ..friendly tribe to
them, they would pitch in and start to dancing.

29:03.034 --> 29:05.446
Now, this was one of the biggest feats
that ever happened

29:05.578 --> 29:07.785
during the Mardi Gras in New Orleans.

29:07.914 --> 29:12.453
Even when the parades that cost millions of
dollars would be coming along,

29:12.585 --> 29:15.292
if a band of Indians was to come in,

29:15.421 --> 29:17.662
why, the parade wouldn't
have anybody there.

29:17.798 --> 29:19.880
Everybody would flock
to see the Indians.

29:20.009 --> 29:22.625
They would dance
and they would sing.

29:30.519 --> 29:33.807
It's journalism. It isn't cheerleading.
If we're gonna be true to what we believe...

29:33.940 --> 29:37.899
Excuse me.
This is how the Creole fairy folk back home

29:38.027 --> 29:40.143
cure their three—day stubble.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.611
(Gasping, exclaiming)

29:49.372 --> 29:53.365
Sazerac? They gotta be kidding.
Nobody throws a sazerac.

29:55.252 --> 29:57.914
— Looking good.
— Yeah, you're right.

29:58.047 --> 30:00.959
Come back in about six months
for the best fried chicken you ever ate.

30:01.092 --> 30:03.458
Deal. You called me?

30:03.594 --> 30:05.585
Merry Christmas to you too.

30:07.098 --> 30:09.214
Everything, right? Everything?

30:09.350 --> 30:10.965
That's what they said.

30:11.102 --> 30:13.514
All this stuff flooded.
It's contaminated.

30:13.646 --> 30:15.432
It's on the second damn floor.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.270
Ain't nothing wrong with any of it.

30:17.400 --> 30:20.733
If they said the second floor flooded,
the second floor flooded.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.271
Even the books?

30:24.031 --> 30:26.272
Just want to make sure.

30:26.409 --> 30:29.776
— And the books too.
— Esta bem. Os Iivros tambem.

30:30.663 --> 30:32.619
(Nelson) What kind of Spanish is that?

30:32.748 --> 30:35.831
It's Portuguese. They're Brazilian.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.825
It's a long way to come for a job.

30:37.962 --> 30:39.953
Not if you ain't got one.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.338
You going home for Christmas?

30:43.467 --> 30:47.176
Every day's been Christmas since I've been
in New Orleans. Why leave now?

30:47.304 --> 30:49.681
I'm going up to Baton Rouge
for a quick minute, come back,

30:49.807 --> 30:53.174
stuff a few more stockings here,
and then I'm spending a quiet holiday season

30:53.310 --> 30:56.177
in my hotel suite with
one of my nearest and dearest.

30:56.313 --> 30:59.020
I've seen your nearest and dearest —

30:59.150 --> 31:01.892
just big enough to sit
on old Santa's knee.

31:02.028 --> 31:04.735
Naughty and nice.
Here, buy 'em lunch.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.070
Iwill.

31:08.409 --> 31:10.400
(I Track playing of Davis singing)

31:20.671 --> 31:23.663
Of course, there's gonna be a horn line
where that synth is.

31:23.799 --> 31:24.914
Mm—hm.

31:25.051 --> 31:29.215
And I'm gonna go out and get somebody
that can kill that guitar riff better than I can.

31:29.346 --> 31:31.337
Mm.

31:38.939 --> 31:41.225
I mean, this is working.

31:42.943 --> 31:44.649
— Right?
- Yeah.

31:44.779 --> 31:46.690
Don?

31:49.867 --> 31:51.858
Funny stuff, man.

31:53.746 --> 31:55.236
It's a relationship track...

31:57.249 --> 31:58.955
something from the heart.

31:59.085 --> 32:01.417
This is my... This is my slowjam.

32:07.718 --> 32:09.458
If it had been the Cowboys,

32:09.595 --> 32:12.177
you'd have to wrestle those tickets
from my cold, dead hands.

32:12.306 --> 32:15.514
I thought you had to be a season—ticket holder
to get playoff tickets this early.

32:15.643 --> 32:17.725
Well, maybe you just need to know one.

32:18.813 --> 32:20.974
I don't see any strings attached.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.223
This is one friend to another.

32:23.359 --> 32:26.851
The only payback I'm looking for
is if you see a sweet exacta at the track.

32:26.987 --> 32:27.976
That'll work.

32:28.114 --> 32:31.652
Look, I talked to your man Liguori
and he says you're right.

32:31.784 --> 32:32.864
Of course I'm right.

32:32.993 --> 32:35.905
Now, enjoy the game.
That dome will be rocking.

32:39.041 --> 32:41.908
(Toni) No, I didn't call beforehand,
but I'm sure we can just go on the list.

32:42.044 --> 32:43.705
We'll be all right.

32:43.838 --> 32:45.328
Well, well, well.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.500
Sofia, say hello to Officer Cantone.

32:47.633 --> 32:48.839
— Hi.
— How are you, darlin'?

32:48.968 --> 32:51.505
— Fine.
— Won't you go on in, put our name on that list.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.094
I'll be right in. How's it going, Charlie?

32:54.223 --> 32:56.259
Good. Same old, same old. You?

32:56.392 --> 32:59.680
About the same.
Still dealing with the fallout from the storm.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.643
It's time to move on.

33:01.772 --> 33:04.559
Like that Danziger crap.
What's done is done.

33:04.692 --> 33:06.774
That was the storm. Get over it.

33:06.902 --> 33:11.145
Well, I'd like to, if the First didn't stir up
the shit at Robideaux's.

33:11.282 --> 33:12.192
Robideaux's?

33:12.324 --> 33:16.488
Yeah, I got a bunch of witnesses say the First
came in and cleared the place with billy clubs.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.030
Looters.

33:18.164 --> 33:20.576
And we were letting it go,
turning a blind eye.

33:24.587 --> 33:27.454
Then they start taking potshots
at one of our guys.

33:27.590 --> 33:30.582
They fired at your officers?
At Robideaux's?

33:30.718 --> 33:34.085
Even you would agree
that's a line you gotta draw.

33:34.221 --> 33:37.133
So we went over,
swept out the undesirable element.

33:37.850 --> 33:39.386
Come on, Charlie.
You heard shots.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.554
You wanted an excuse to go over
and kick some ass.

33:41.687 --> 33:45.179
Serious shit, Toni.
O'Dell was taking rifle fire.

33:45.316 --> 33:48.023
Shot up his car.
It was out of control.

33:48.152 --> 33:50.768
Governor said,
"Take back the city."

33:50.905 --> 33:52.395
We took back the city.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.442
You sure did.

33:57.161 --> 33:58.446
Enjoy your dinner.

33:58.579 --> 34:00.570
You stay out of the rain.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.576
- (J‘ Funk music playing)
— Ladies and gentlemen,

34:03.709 --> 34:07.452
you have been listening
to the celestial sounds

34:07.588 --> 34:12.708
of Antoine Batiste
And The Soul Apostles!

34:12.843 --> 34:15.505
— (Cheering)
— Please welcome to the stage

34:15.638 --> 34:17.424
the man with the plan,

34:17.556 --> 34:20.218
the 'bone with the tone
that makes it home,

34:20.351 --> 34:23.764
Mr. Antoine Batiste!

34:23.896 --> 34:25.887
(Crowd chanting)

34:40.871 --> 34:44.580
— Yeah! Yeah!
— (Cheering)

34:45.334 --> 34:48.326
Yeah, so what are you
gonna play next, Bat?

34:48.462 --> 34:50.874
— Wanda, I don't know.
— (Laughter)

34:51.006 --> 34:53.292
— But whatsoever I play...
— Mm—hm.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.007
— ..it's got to be funky.
— Yeah.

34:56.136 --> 34:57.512
One, two, three.

34:57.638 --> 34:59.094
J‘ Make it funky

35:00.140 --> 35:01.926
J‘ Make it funky

35:02.935 --> 35:04.300
J‘ Make it funky

35:05.396 --> 35:07.057
J‘ Make it funky

35:18.826 --> 35:19.815
J‘ Funky

35:19.952 --> 35:23.194
J‘ I'm gonna make it funky now

35:23.330 --> 35:25.070
J‘ Make it funky

35:25.207 --> 35:27.573
J‘ Now make it funky... J‘

35:28.085 --> 35:29.791
(Big Freedia)
You gotta work it, girl.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.876
(Mimi) Up and down.

35:32.006 --> 35:34.418
— Side to side.
— Oh, my back.

35:34.550 --> 35:36.506
(Big Freedia) Rock it side to side.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.092
I can do that.
Whoa! No, I can't.

35:39.221 --> 35:44.966
— (Big Freedia) Yes, you can.
— Ladies, can we please, please, please...

35:46.145 --> 35:49.979
— put down one track before midnight?
— (Big Freedia) Let me see you now.

35:50.107 --> 35:52.564
Aunt Mimi, it's your nickel.

35:52.693 --> 35:54.684
I'm not complaining.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.606
Mimi, a little help.

35:56.739 --> 35:58.946
Ladies, excuse me.

35:59.074 --> 36:00.905
(Big Freedia) You wanted this, Nobby?

36:02.036 --> 36:03.822
Hey, uh, Katey,

36:03.954 --> 36:05.945
you want to hear that beat again?

36:06.081 --> 36:09.824
Damn, Davis, I'm—a tell you when I'm ready.
When I'm ready I'm-a tell you.

36:09.960 --> 36:13.293
If you'd stop texting
and start writing...

36:15.174 --> 36:17.005
What about this beat, Katey?

36:17.134 --> 36:19.125
(Plays a bounce track)

36:26.643 --> 36:28.895
J‘ I'm—a tell you when I'm ready,
when I'm ready I'm-a tell you

36:29.021 --> 36:31.558
J‘ I'm—a tell you when I'm ready, when I'm ready
I'm-a tell you

36:31.690 --> 36:33.226
J‘ You buggin' me and you ugaly

36:33.359 --> 36:35.725
J‘ You ugaly, you ugaly
and you buggin' me

36:35.861 --> 36:37.146
J‘ I'm—a tell you when I'm ready... J‘

36:37.279 --> 36:39.736
(Mimi) "You buggin' me and you ugaly."

36:39.865 --> 36:41.321
I love it. That's brilliant.

36:41.450 --> 36:43.782
Davis? Don?

36:43.911 --> 36:45.617
Hey.

36:45.746 --> 36:48.078
J‘ I'm—a tell you when I'm ready,
when I'm ready I'm-a tell you

36:48.207 --> 36:49.788
J‘ I'm—a tell you when I'm ready... J‘

36:55.756 --> 36:57.792
Man, that shit sounded good.

36:57.925 --> 36:59.290
Yeah,

36:59.426 --> 37:01.587
especially when you was
in the pocket on that break.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.302
(lmitates percussion)

37:04.431 --> 37:06.763
Man, you sounded like
Zigaboo Modeliste himself.

37:06.892 --> 37:09.008
Just playing the arrangement, boss.

37:09.144 --> 37:11.396
— Boy, that was fun.
- (All) Yeah.

37:11.522 --> 37:14.935
This is it. I mean, this is my main shit now.

37:15.067 --> 37:16.307
We got us a band.

37:16.443 --> 37:18.900
Already there's about, like, five gigs.

37:19.029 --> 37:20.235
Serious?

37:20.364 --> 37:23.856
Yeah, I got us two nights running
down at the Bottom Line on Claiborne,

37:23.992 --> 37:25.948
Christmas night and Christmas Eve.

37:26.078 --> 37:28.285
- What?
— That's it.

37:28.414 --> 37:31.156
— I'm talking about a holiday extravaganza.
— Cha—ching!

37:31.291 --> 37:32.201
Oh, man.

37:32.334 --> 37:36.293
Hold it, I got a gig with Papa Grows
on Christmas Eve.

37:36.422 --> 37:38.663
— Oh.
— Oh shit.

37:38.799 --> 37:39.754
Come on, June.

37:39.883 --> 37:42.340
Come on, man, what happened to that
"I would be honored" and all that?

37:42.469 --> 37:44.505
I'm sorry, but I told you.

37:44.638 --> 37:46.344
— You did?
- Yeah.

37:46.473 --> 37:48.134
Fuck!

37:48.267 --> 37:49.677
The other guitar player.

37:49.810 --> 37:51.016
— Sonny?
— Yeah.

37:51.145 --> 37:53.978
Mm, Idon't know.
He's all right.

37:54.106 --> 37:56.347
Come on, man, short notice.
What choice we got?

38:00.320 --> 38:02.777
— All right, call him tomorrow.
- All right.

38:02.906 --> 38:06.774
I'm not gonna let one of these damn
guitar players mess up my night tonight.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.825
Yeah, you know, I know one of them
lovely young ladies over there.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.994
Huh? Whoa. I bet you do.

38:15.127 --> 38:18.290
Uh—huh. I got an idea.

38:18.422 --> 38:20.037
(Man) Oh my God.
(Man #2) Good Lord.

38:20.174 --> 38:21.380
(Antoine) Mm—hm.

38:21.508 --> 38:23.840
(J‘ Radio playing jazz)

38:29.433 --> 38:32.175
Hey, Christmas Eve
or no Christmas Eve,

38:32.311 --> 38:34.302
post office is closed on Sundays.

38:35.522 --> 38:36.477
Thanks.

38:36.607 --> 38:38.017
You're moving better.

38:38.150 --> 38:40.141
Still hurts to bend.

38:45.949 --> 38:48.531
I got here, and right as I drove up
and poom, poom!

38:48.660 --> 38:50.696
Two in the rear passenger—side door.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.615
Charlie said you were scared.

38:52.748 --> 38:54.158
Yeah, I was freaked.

38:54.291 --> 38:56.373
I mean, holy shit,

38:56.502 --> 38:58.288
rifle fire?

38:58.420 --> 39:01.753
I did not hesitate.
I pulled a u—ee and got the fuck out of there.

39:01.882 --> 39:04.214
Could you tell where
the shots came from?

39:04.343 --> 39:06.584
Sounded like somebody up high,

39:06.720 --> 39:09.211
roof or balcony,

39:09.348 --> 39:10.713
projects maybe.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.965
— The Iberville?
— Could have been.

39:13.101 --> 39:15.262
I don't know.

39:15.395 --> 39:17.852
So you get back to the station and...

39:17.981 --> 39:21.940
I get back to the house.
The guys see the bullet holes, flip out.

39:22.069 --> 39:23.775
About a half—dozen of us posse up,

39:23.904 --> 39:25.860
go back to Robideaux's
and lay down the law.

39:25.989 --> 39:27.695
And you go in the store?

39:27.824 --> 39:31.408
No, I...stayed outside and chased them off
as they were coming out.

39:31.537 --> 39:34.074
But some of y'all went in the store.

39:34.206 --> 39:35.161
Oh yeah.

39:35.290 --> 39:38.999
And they came out saying they recognized
some assholes from the Iberville.

39:39.127 --> 39:42.335
Next thing I know,
fuck if they're not headed over there.

39:42.464 --> 39:43.544
You too?

39:45.092 --> 39:48.334
Nah, we'd been through
three days of hell by then.

39:49.346 --> 39:51.177
I didn't need me no more.

39:51.306 --> 39:53.513
So who led the charge over to Iberville?

39:57.271 --> 40:00.354
You mean, like, names?

40:00.482 --> 40:01.938
Yeah.

40:06.655 --> 40:07.861
I don't remember.

40:09.241 --> 40:10.697
It was pretty chaotic.

40:10.826 --> 40:12.862
That whole week, it's a blur.

40:12.995 --> 40:15.327
Well, thank you, Officer O'Dell,

40:15.455 --> 40:17.411
for meeting me on your day off.

40:19.543 --> 40:21.750
Charlie did say I should talk to you, right?

40:21.878 --> 40:23.869
He gave me your name.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.757
Shit.

40:32.389 --> 40:34.425
(Billiard balls clacking)

40:37.311 --> 40:40.974
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

40:41.106 --> 40:44.473
Oh, I don't know what I'd do without my babies.

40:44.610 --> 40:46.851
Not that I'm likely to need them anytime soon.

40:46.987 --> 40:48.318
Jack on the rocks.

40:48.447 --> 40:52.110
Uh, your name shall live in history.

40:52.242 --> 40:54.107
Infamy, you mean.

40:54.244 --> 40:57.077
I have never ever, ever done
anything like that in my life.

40:57.205 --> 40:59.366
Have you seen
the website eater.com?

40:59.499 --> 41:01.490
You're fucking famous.

41:01.627 --> 41:02.662
Thanks.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.001
That kind of famous I don't need.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.746
I fucked up big time,

41:07.883 --> 41:09.214
biggest ever

41:09.343 --> 41:11.208
in, like, the history of the world.

41:11.345 --> 41:13.552
A total disgrace. I mean, I'll never work again.

41:13.680 --> 41:16.387
I don't know about you opening a restaurant
in New York anytime soon,

41:16.516 --> 41:19.508
but holy shit,
you're a fucking outlaw.

41:19.645 --> 41:22.261
Have you seen the shit
they're saying about you on the internet?

41:22.397 --> 41:25.434
They make you sound like Bonnie and Clyde,
but without the Clyde.

41:25.567 --> 41:29.230
— You're a fucking hero!
— Oh, my God,

41:29.363 --> 41:31.194
I want to die.

41:31.323 --> 41:34.315
Don't die.
Just change your name.

41:35.452 --> 41:37.067
-Bonme.
—(Laughs)

41:37.204 --> 41:38.319
Bonnie!

41:42.417 --> 41:44.999
Can we wrap this bitch up
and get out of here, man? The game's on.

41:45.128 --> 41:46.664
Oh, go the hell on.

41:46.797 --> 41:50.130
Hey, man, can you get that bell sound
out of that synth?

41:50.258 --> 41:51.247
Igotyou.

41:51.385 --> 41:55.719
And don't forget the one at the end,
you know, ding, ding, ding.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.553
The sleigh bells. Yeah, I got it.

41:57.683 --> 42:01.301
Oh, I see your boy's shuttle from Amsterdam
must have been late.

42:01.436 --> 42:03.222
I thought rehearsal was for noon.

42:03.355 --> 42:06.222
Everybody else knew what time
rehearsal was for.

42:06.358 --> 42:09.976
I'm sorry. But I learned the tunes
you told me to learn.

42:10.112 --> 42:12.603
Yeah, we'll see how it goes tonight.

42:12.739 --> 42:15.276
Y'all make sure he knows
what time the gig is for.

42:15.409 --> 42:17.274
And wear something red.

42:21.415 --> 42:23.531
(Music playing, all chattering)

42:23.667 --> 42:25.532
God, this actually looks good.

42:25.669 --> 42:27.284
O Tannenbaum like a motherfucker.

42:27.421 --> 42:30.163
— Let me see. Give me a mirror or something.
- No, no, no.

42:30.298 --> 42:32.675
Hey, assholes,
could you keep it down?

42:32.801 --> 42:35.292
Some of us are actually trying to do
some police work here.

42:35.429 --> 42:37.385
Tell it to Santa.

42:39.349 --> 42:41.806
You, you're right.
It's too noisy in here.

42:41.935 --> 42:44.847
You, turn that radio down. And you two,

42:44.980 --> 42:46.686
a little more tinsel around the ears.

42:46.815 --> 42:48.271
(Snickering)

42:51.153 --> 42:54.111
Who dat? Who dat say
dey gonna beat dem Saints?

42:54.239 --> 42:58.608
Who dat? Who dat? Who dat say
dey gonna beat dem Saints?

42:58.744 --> 43:00.575
Who dat? Who dat?

43:00.704 --> 43:03.286
Who dat say dey gonna
beat dem Saints?

43:03.415 --> 43:04.404
(Cheering)

43:04.541 --> 43:07.032
You people colonized this bar?

43:07.169 --> 43:09.956
This is like the Louisiana Purchase in reverse.

43:10.088 --> 43:11.749
Black and gold, baby.

43:11.882 --> 43:16.296
Is this always a New Orleans bar
or just Sundays in football season?

43:16.428 --> 43:18.419
24/7, 365.

43:18.555 --> 43:20.261
It's like New Orleans in exile.

43:20.390 --> 43:23.553
They're playing the Giants in New York.

43:23.685 --> 43:25.676
Yeah?

43:25.812 --> 43:27.723
It should be illegal.

43:28.774 --> 43:31.311
So, Jelly Roll Morton?

43:31.443 --> 43:34.059
All right, there's just something
elemental and soulful

43:34.196 --> 43:37.029
about New Orleans music
and New Orleans culture.

43:37.157 --> 43:39.990
And we've lost that in contemporary jazz.
You know what I'm saying?

43:40.118 --> 43:41.654
OK.

43:41.787 --> 43:45.325
I want to do a modern jazz record
that'll ring true to New Orleans.

43:45.457 --> 43:47.072
But I want to make a statement.

43:47.209 --> 43:49.200
If Picasso was modern,

43:49.336 --> 43:52.703
then Louis Armstrong and Papa Celestin,
they modern too.

43:52.839 --> 43:54.579
Papa who?

43:54.716 --> 43:55.796
Didn't you fire me?

43:55.926 --> 43:58.508
What? Don't even worry about that, man.

43:58.637 --> 43:59.752
Don't trip over that.

43:59.888 --> 44:03.972
And I told you a year ago
to make a New Orleans album.

44:04.100 --> 44:06.307
Well, that's why I'm rehiring you, Woodrow,

44:06.436 --> 44:08.813
'cause you're so damn smart, you know?

44:10.440 --> 44:12.977
Even when we whip your ass today?

44:14.986 --> 44:18.444
So she's going out with this guy
who, like, totally dissed Jane.

44:18.573 --> 44:20.905
So Jane comes to me
and asks me to talk to her.

44:21.034 --> 44:24.401
And I'm like, I don't want to get
in the middle of it.

44:24.538 --> 44:26.574
What do you mean, going out?

44:27.999 --> 44:30.115
You know, like, going out.

44:30.252 --> 44:32.038
It's not a big deal or anything.

44:32.170 --> 44:34.001
(Cell phone chimes)

44:34.130 --> 44:36.542
Sof, you think we can have five minutes
of mother-daughter time

44:36.675 --> 44:39.382
alone at Christmas
without that cell phone?

44:39.511 --> 44:41.172
Oh my God.

44:42.097 --> 44:43.928
Mr. Weyman committed suicide.

44:46.643 --> 44:48.349
Mr. Weyman at Lusher?

44:48.478 --> 44:50.514
Honors chemistry.

44:55.443 --> 44:56.899
Jesus, Sof.

44:57.904 --> 45:00.395
That... That's terrible.

45:03.785 --> 45:05.867
Did he have family?

45:05.996 --> 45:07.987
He wasn't one of my teachers, Mom.

45:11.543 --> 45:15.912
They found him yesterday in his house.
He, like, shot himself.

45:17.549 --> 45:21.133
Baby, you want to talk about this?

45:22.679 --> 45:25.091
If you want.
I didn't really know him.

45:30.145 --> 45:31.931
(Cheering)

45:32.606 --> 45:34.847
(Crowd chanting)
Reggie! Reggie! Reggie!

45:36.735 --> 45:37.975
Yeah!

45:40.030 --> 45:44.820
Hey, JetBlue, MSY to JFK.
That's where I know you from.

45:44.951 --> 45:47.283
6:25am, one eye open.

45:47.412 --> 45:49.494
Yeah, so you're living here now
or back down home?

45:49.623 --> 45:51.204
I moved up here last spring.

45:51.333 --> 45:54.450
— OK, how you like it?
- I do like it, actually.

45:54.586 --> 45:56.122
There's a lot to like about New York.

45:56.254 --> 45:59.337
I like not having to think about
the federal flood all the time.

45:59.466 --> 46:00.751
Oh, true that. True that.

46:00.884 --> 46:03.466
Delmond, Delmond Lambreaux.

46:03.595 --> 46:06.337
Janette Desautel. What about you?
Are you New York or NOLA?

46:06.473 --> 46:08.179
He's been here for years.

46:08.308 --> 46:10.799
Although I'm taking an early flight tomorrow
back down there.

46:10.936 --> 46:12.847
I'm—a take my daddy out
for Christmas dinner.

46:12.979 --> 46:15.015
— Oh nice.
- Yeah.

46:15.148 --> 46:18.311
- What is that?
— Oh, that's my knife roll.

46:18.443 --> 46:20.900
— Oh, are you a chef?
- Or something.

46:21.029 --> 46:23.020
I walked out of my restaurant last night.

46:23.156 --> 46:27.149
Oh, so you're kind of like one of them ronin
from medieval Japan.

46:27.285 --> 46:29.662
You wander the earth
with your sword but got no master.

46:29.788 --> 46:33.155
Yeah, if that's a nice way of saying
that I'm out of work, yeah.

46:33.291 --> 46:34.576
Oh, it's a rough town for it.

46:34.709 --> 46:37.496
Yeah, tell me about it.
What about you? What do you do?

46:37.629 --> 46:39.836
He's a great musician.

46:39.965 --> 46:41.956
Invite her to your gig, you dope.

46:42.092 --> 46:43.707
Yeah, invite me to your gig, you dope.

46:43.843 --> 46:46.880
I'm playing at the Blue Note.
I'll put you on the guest list.

46:47.013 --> 46:48.514
Wow, that'd be fantastic.

46:48.640 --> 46:50.926
No problem.
You, uh, need a plus—one?

46:51.059 --> 46:52.299
Sure. Why not?

46:52.435 --> 46:53.936
OK.

46:54.062 --> 46:57.554
Hark, what's that sound on my roof
fucking up my shingles?

46:57.691 --> 47:01.434
Well, that must be
Santa Claus and his reindeer.

47:02.612 --> 47:03.943
Ha!

47:06.032 --> 47:07.818
(Whistling)

47:14.124 --> 47:16.080
J‘ Mama in the kitchen cooking

47:16.209 --> 47:18.825
J‘ The children fast asleep

47:18.962 --> 47:21.248
J‘ It's time for old Santa Claus

47:21.381 --> 47:24.373
J‘ To take that midnight drink

47:24.509 --> 47:26.374
J‘ Santa Claus needs some lovin'

47:26.511 --> 47:29.298
J‘ Well, oh

47:29.431 --> 47:31.797
J‘ Santa Claus wants some Iovin'... J‘

47:31.933 --> 47:33.673
Come on.

48:08.678 --> 48:10.589
(Tap)

48:25.278 --> 48:28.236
(Band chatting, laughing)

48:40.794 --> 48:42.705
Right now.

48:42.837 --> 48:44.577
Merry Christmas.

48:57.936 --> 48:59.801
I know what you're dealing with.

49:01.106 --> 49:03.097
And I know something else.

49:04.734 --> 49:07.942
You ain't in no danger of being
like no great musician, man.

49:08.780 --> 49:10.771
No, I know.

49:10.907 --> 49:13.444
So you might not want
to blow this here gig.

49:14.661 --> 49:17.277
'Cause how many more
are you gonna get?

49:17.413 --> 49:18.949
It's a small town.

49:20.416 --> 49:22.077
And word gets around, man.

49:23.419 --> 49:26.035
(Distant train horn)

49:27.799 --> 49:29.755
(Sighs)

49:35.390 --> 49:37.597
Hey, Mama, look what Daddy got me.

49:38.643 --> 49:41.225
Looks like he stepped up
his game this year.

49:41.354 --> 49:44.346
Look what he got me —
a Fly Wheels XPV.

49:44.482 --> 49:46.188
What's that do, baby?

49:46.317 --> 49:48.399
— Flies around the room.
— Oh.

49:48.528 --> 49:50.314
You make it go with
your remote control.

49:50.446 --> 49:52.232
It can come up to 20 stories high.

49:55.618 --> 49:57.449
Hey, when you were growing up,

49:57.579 --> 50:01.117
did you all open presents
on Christmas Eve

50:01.249 --> 50:03.865
or did you wait till
early Christmas morning?

50:05.336 --> 50:09.079
Mm... Christmas Eve
Mom would let us open

50:09.215 --> 50:11.672
one present before we went to bed.

50:11.801 --> 50:13.792
That's sweet.

50:13.928 --> 50:15.213
Yeah.

50:16.681 --> 50:18.672
It was always flannel pajamas.

50:20.059 --> 50:21.265
That sucks.

50:23.146 --> 50:24.886
(Laughs)

50:26.858 --> 50:28.723
I have something for you.

50:28.860 --> 50:32.023
I thought we said no presents.

50:33.781 --> 50:37.945
I always tried to stay up and wait for Santa
on Christmas Eve...

50:40.246 --> 50:42.578
but that was the one night of the year

50:42.707 --> 50:45.744
when Aunt Mimi would sneak me

50:45.877 --> 50:48.619
some of her special eggnog.

50:48.755 --> 50:51.337
(Annie playing Mendelssohn Violin Concerto)

51:29.921 --> 51:32.378
(Radio) You're listening to
the Gentilly Junior Christmas show.

51:32.507 --> 51:33.997
And we have plenty of Christmas tunes

51:34.133 --> 51:36.715
— coming your way.
— Yeah. Ah.

51:36.844 --> 51:40.132
— (Radio) Get your radios turned up good.
- Ooh.

51:40.265 --> 51:41.380
Boo!

51:41.516 --> 51:43.507
(Chuckling)

51:46.479 --> 51:49.471
Yeah, yeah.
You know you like it.

51:50.149 --> 51:52.891
— You like it, huh?
- Shit.

51:53.027 --> 51:54.938
Come here.

51:55.071 --> 51:56.902
Yeah, you like it.

51:57.031 --> 51:59.113
Yeah, all right now, Christmastime.

52:01.369 --> 52:04.532
This is when I miss your mama.

52:04.664 --> 52:06.825
Baked ham and pineapples,

52:06.958 --> 52:09.370
cushaw pumpkin,
stuffed mirlitons,

52:09.502 --> 52:12.619
some of them carrots
Aunt Odette taught her how to make.

52:13.673 --> 52:15.413
How's your filet, Pop?

52:15.550 --> 52:17.381
It's a little pink.

52:17.510 --> 52:19.011
It's supposed to be.

52:19.137 --> 52:21.344
I know how you like it —
knock the horns off it,

52:21.472 --> 52:23.884
wipe its ass and send it on out.

52:24.976 --> 52:27.183
Not me. I like mine cooked.

52:27.312 --> 52:30.224
— You want to send it back?
— So they can mess it up again?

52:31.441 --> 52:33.056
What is it with you?

52:33.192 --> 52:35.604
You know you ain't been
yourself lately, right?

52:35.737 --> 52:38.149
— Nothing pleases you.
— I'm the same as I always was,

52:38.281 --> 52:39.896
nothing pleases me unless it's right.

52:40.033 --> 52:42.649
Food ain't right.
Going to Atlanta by Cheri's ain't right,

52:42.785 --> 52:44.400
over to Houston by Davina's ain't right.

52:44.537 --> 52:47.654
I didn't ask you to come all the way down here
to take me out to Christmas dinner.

52:47.790 --> 52:49.291
Now, this was your idea.

52:53.671 --> 52:56.378
— You know, you might be depressed.
— Depressed, hell.

52:56.507 --> 52:58.759
You've been through a lot.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

52:58.885 --> 53:01.251
Ain't no thing. They got medicine for that now.

53:01.387 --> 53:04.299
That's what you think I need, medicine?

53:06.059 --> 53:09.096
You know how many applications they got
for that Road Home money?

53:09.228 --> 53:10.729
—Hmm?
— No.

53:10.855 --> 53:12.720
90,000.

53:12.857 --> 53:14.813
And mine is one of them.

53:16.069 --> 53:17.730
You know how many
they processed so far?

53:17.862 --> 53:20.604
I read this in the newspaper the other day.

53:20.740 --> 53:22.480
— How many?
- 82.

53:23.326 --> 53:27.410
Now, at that rate, when do you think
I'm—a get my money to fix up my house?

53:28.164 --> 53:30.371
Depressed, shit.

53:30.500 --> 53:32.707
I ain't depressed.

53:32.835 --> 53:35.872
I'm just so mad
I can't even see straight.

53:39.133 --> 53:42.296
(J‘ Big Joe Williams: Christmas Blues)

54:49.287 --> 54:51.118
— Hey.
— Hey.

54:51.247 --> 54:52.202
You good?

54:52.331 --> 54:54.117
Yeah, let's go.

54:55.418 --> 54:57.033
I know, yeah.

54:57.712 --> 55:00.499
- For real?
— Say, Terrell, time to do this thing.

55:00.631 --> 55:02.622
I know. You too.

55:04.010 --> 55:05.500
That was Bennie.

55:05.636 --> 55:07.137
How's he doing?

55:07.263 --> 55:08.628
(Exhales)

55:09.891 --> 55:11.973
Dinerral just got shot.

55:14.312 --> 55:15.802
He's dead.

55:15.938 --> 55:17.724
What the fuck?

55:17.857 --> 55:20.724
Some kid busted his gut
at a stop sign.

55:20.860 --> 55:23.192
Wasn't even aiming at Dinerral.

55:26.115 --> 55:27.525
Damn.

55:30.495 --> 55:33.237
Damn it. Shit.

55:33.372 --> 55:35.363
(Sirens)

55:41.339 --> 55:43.421
How's Bennie holding up, man?

55:43.549 --> 55:45.335
At first he was like,

55:45.468 --> 55:48.881
"Dinerral gone. He dead."

55:49.013 --> 55:51.004
Then he got real quiet.

55:52.308 --> 55:54.720
And I'm like, "Bennie, Bennie."

55:56.187 --> 55:58.519
And then he said
we got a gig Thursday.

55:58.648 --> 56:01.481
He wonder who we could use
for a snare drummer.

56:02.902 --> 56:05.609
Then he started crying
and hang up the phone.

56:09.200 --> 56:10.736
You bring my steak?

56:10.868 --> 56:12.824
You said you didn't like it.

56:12.954 --> 56:16.287
I said I didn't want them
to mess it up again.

56:16.415 --> 56:20.203
Shit, by the time I put that
in my black skillet,

56:20.336 --> 56:22.702
you're gonna have
a piece of meat.

56:23.965 --> 56:26.456
It's a good thing I know
your crazy ass like I do.

56:27.552 --> 56:29.008
It's in the car.

56:31.847 --> 56:33.974
There's something
I want to tell you.

56:36.727 --> 56:38.433
I was out of line at dinner.

56:38.563 --> 56:40.645
I didn't mean to come at you like that.

56:45.111 --> 56:47.227
I'm glad you realize that.

56:47.363 --> 56:50.605
'Cause I know I ain't crazy.

56:52.952 --> 56:55.910
I got plenty of sense
I ain't even used yet.

56:56.038 --> 56:58.199
(Delmond chuckles)

57:00.876 --> 57:02.662
You a sick man.

57:02.795 --> 57:05.457
Yeah, well, just leave that medicine
when you go.

57:07.133 --> 57:08.669
(Coughing, laughing)

57:09.719 --> 57:11.084
(Laughing)

57:13.264 --> 57:15.255
(Both continue laughing)
