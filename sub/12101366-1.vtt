Mr. Rodick, hey.

07:03.607 --> 07:05.977
It's Dawn from Nate's Haul-n-Go.

07:06.010 --> 07:10.181
Just keeping you in the loop.

07:10.214 --> 07:11.716
I'm gonna pull over for a bit.

07:12.950 --> 07:16.554
Making great time, blew
through the Midwest.

07:16.587 --> 07:18.122
I won't let myself fall behind.

07:19.223 --> 07:20.057
Okay.

07:21.125 --> 07:22.827
Just give me a call back
if you have any questions,

07:22.860 --> 07:24.428
and thanks for choosing Nate's.

08:40.104 --> 08:40.938
Shit!

08:46.744 --> 08:47.578
Shit.

08:53.117 --> 08:54.685
Can you hear me?!

08:57.188 --> 08:59.757
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

09:09.433 --> 09:11.535
I'm coming over! Okay?!

09:35.092 --> 09:35.926
I need water.

09:43.701 --> 09:45.102
Yeah, of course.

09:45.970 --> 09:47.204
I need to call the
police.

09:54.945 --> 09:56.180
I'm sorry, I gotta take this.

09:56.213 --> 09:57.414
- One second.
- Can I please...

09:57.448 --> 09:59.150
Nate's Haul-n-Go. Dawn
speaking.

10:00.317 --> 10:01.620
Yes, hi, how's it going?

10:02.621 --> 10:03.687
You got my voicemail?

10:04.989 --> 10:06.824
Yeah, everything's fine.

10:06.857 --> 10:09.260
Yeah, GPS says we're all good
time-wise.

10:11.662 --> 10:13.297
Yeah, it's perfectly safe here.

10:13.330 --> 10:15.199
I can barely keep my eyes open.

10:15.232 --> 10:16.300
Can you hurry it up, please?

10:16.333 --> 10:17.902
What?

10:17.935 --> 10:18.836
Yeah.

10:18.869 --> 10:20.171
Sorry, there's actually

10:20.204 --> 10:21.272
a young woman here.

10:21.305 --> 10:23.642
She's all worked up.

10:23.674 --> 10:25.142
She's just asking for help.

10:26.310 --> 10:28.112
- I know.
- Can I just use your phone?

10:28.145 --> 10:29.847
One second! Jesus!

10:33.284 --> 10:34.118
Of course.

10:35.587 --> 10:37.188
Yeah, I got off at Chocohan.

10:38.557 --> 10:39.390
Chocohan.

10:41.458 --> 10:45.129
I forget the exit, but it's
a state park around there.

10:45.162 --> 10:45.963
I'm trying to remember.

10:45.996 --> 10:48.032
It was about, I wanna say 10
miles...

10:56.675 --> 10:57.942
Hey! What the hell?!

11:01.378 --> 11:02.413
Are you kidding me?

11:04.448 --> 11:06.550
What the hell is that?
Put that thing away.

11:13.424 --> 11:14.291
God damn it.

11:17.995 --> 11:19.564
We have to get out of here,
now.

11:19.598 --> 11:20.431
Hey!

11:20.464 --> 11:22.066
Slow down.

11:22.099 --> 11:24.501
I'm not going anywhere
unless it involves a bed.

11:29.306 --> 11:31.342
I have to get to the
police. Someone's after me.

11:42.086 --> 11:43.688
Please, I really need your help.

11:58.936 --> 12:03.207
Could you take me to the
nearest police station, please?

12:03.240 --> 12:05.644
Look, I'm beyond exhausted.

12:07.177 --> 12:08.545
It's working.

12:08.580 --> 12:09.413
Hello?

12:10.381 --> 12:11.915
Hello?

12:11.949 --> 12:12.783
Let me try.

12:21.559 --> 12:24.228
All right, you're
starting to freak me out.

12:24.261 --> 12:25.296
What's going on?

12:26.731 --> 12:28.799
I was locked in a trunk.

12:30.034 --> 12:31.435
He'll be looking for me.

12:32.604 --> 12:33.437
What?

12:34.673 --> 12:36.574
Please, let's go.

12:39.209 --> 12:40.344
Oh, my god.

12:43.581 --> 12:45.082
Are you all right?

12:49.754 --> 12:50.588
Okay.

12:51.822 --> 12:56.226
Okay, I saw a sign for a town,
like, 10 miles west of here.

12:56.260 --> 12:58.462
They'll have a police
station or something.

13:00.297 --> 13:01.432
I guess we can head east too.

13:01.465 --> 13:03.702
There might be a closer town
that way.

13:03.735 --> 13:05.069
Okay. Thank you.

13:19.049 --> 13:21.051
- What's happening?
- Shit.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.534
Whoa! Whoa!

13:37.569 --> 13:38.803
Hey!

13:38.837 --> 13:41.372
This isn't a rental, okay?!

13:41.405 --> 13:42.473
This is my livelihood.

13:42.506 --> 13:43.941
This is my business.

13:45.109 --> 13:46.711
I'll get you to the police
station,

13:46.745 --> 13:48.613
but you need to treat me
and, more importantly,

13:48.646 --> 13:50.080
my truck with respect.

13:50.114 --> 13:50.948
You got that?

13:58.255 --> 13:59.657
That's my emergency backpack.

13:59.691 --> 14:01.325
I know I didn't put them in
there.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.534
Yeah, great.

14:10.568 --> 14:11.402
Finish it.

14:30.354 --> 14:32.990
Always with these damn keys.

14:33.023 --> 14:34.191
What does that mean?

14:34.224 --> 14:35.259
I always find them.

14:36.828 --> 14:38.262
Sometimes, it takes days.

14:40.865 --> 14:42.332
I'm kidding.

14:42.366 --> 14:43.200
We'll find them.

14:44.569 --> 14:45.637
Let me check outside.

14:47.037 --> 14:48.673
You wanna help?

14:48.706 --> 14:50.140
You can throw on those boots.

14:57.615 --> 14:59.183
I'll be right back.

15:59.711 --> 16:00.845
Not seeing them.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.749
Shit, what are you doing down
there?

16:04.782 --> 16:05.683
Just get low.

16:05.717 --> 16:07.685
Yeah, I'd be asking for a
cramp.

16:08.686 --> 16:10.220
Where are the keys?

16:10.254 --> 16:12.590
I just told you, I didn't find
them.

16:13.791 --> 16:15.392
Did you see anyone out there?

16:15.425 --> 16:16.928
We're in the middle of
nowhere.

16:16.961 --> 16:19.463
We gotta stay outta sight
until I figure it out.

16:20.999 --> 16:22.934
You really think someone's
after you?

16:24.602 --> 16:25.737
There's no doubt.

16:27.204 --> 16:30.374
Well, no one would ever be
able to find you out here.

16:30.407 --> 16:32.075
You have no fucking clue.

16:34.646 --> 16:36.046
I don't know what to do.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.015
What do we do?

16:37.047 --> 16:40.183
- Just get down.
- Listen, I can't get down.

16:40.217 --> 16:41.886
I was kidnapped June 3rd.

16:41.920 --> 16:44.121
My name is Phoebe Beenum.

16:44.154 --> 16:46.558
I was been held prisoner for
four months

16:46.591 --> 16:47.959
in a psycho's basement.

16:54.097 --> 16:55.365
Holy shit.

16:56.233 --> 16:59.102
I just need to stay hidden
until I can get some help.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.306
Please, get down.

17:03.942 --> 17:06.476
There's not enough
room for me down there.

17:06.510 --> 17:09.079
I'm telling you to get down.

17:14.852 --> 17:15.686
Get out.

17:24.929 --> 17:25.762
Open it.

17:27.665 --> 17:28.666
Let's go. Hurry.

17:35.472 --> 17:36.874
Get in.

17:36.908 --> 17:37.675
What?

17:37.709 --> 17:38.643
I said, get in.

17:50.855 --> 17:52.222
Where are the keys?

17:52.255 --> 17:53.625
I don't know.

17:53.658 --> 17:54.926
Get the hell off of me.

17:54.959 --> 17:56.493
I need the keys.

17:58.528 --> 18:01.131
They have to be in the cab
somewhere.

18:01.164 --> 18:03.835
I took a phone call, walked
around the truck a bit,

18:03.868 --> 18:05.770
but they are definitely not back
here.

18:06.971 --> 18:08.171
Don't move.

18:14.646 --> 18:16.648
Hey!

18:16.681 --> 18:17.481
Hey!

18:17.514 --> 18:18.548
Shut up.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.484
Get back here!

18:23.621 --> 18:25.288
Are you kidding me?!

18:26.724 --> 18:27.959
Open this door!

18:35.033 --> 18:37.334
Shut up!

18:37.367 --> 18:38.870
You are pissing me off!

18:39.771 --> 18:41.238
Shut up or I'll smash your
windows!

19:10.735 --> 19:11.736
What are you doing?

19:11.769 --> 19:13.270
Get outta here.

19:13.303 --> 19:15.873
If I can't leave, I need to
hide.

19:15.907 --> 19:17.374
Well, go hide in the
woods.

19:17.407 --> 19:18.876
Leave me alone.

19:18.910 --> 19:20.444
Please. He could be out there.

19:20.477 --> 19:22.212
Plus, it's fucking cold.

19:25.083 --> 19:26.216
Please. Please.

19:26.249 --> 19:27.085
Please.

19:29.087 --> 19:30.121
The bat.

19:30.154 --> 19:30.988
Give me the bat.

19:35.626 --> 19:36.661
Hey!

19:36.694 --> 19:38.196
Hey! Hey!

19:38.228 --> 19:39.496
What the hell?!

19:46.871 --> 19:48.706
Be cool, huh?

19:48.740 --> 19:49.974
Don't do anything stupid.

20:22.840 --> 20:23.641
Sit.

20:34.518 --> 20:35.553
Great.

20:35.586 --> 20:36.419
Now what?

20:38.022 --> 20:38.856
Where are we?

20:39.757 --> 20:41.926
Pretty sure we're in a state
park.

20:41.959 --> 20:42.794
Where?

20:43.628 --> 20:45.529
I don't know, somewhere in
upstate.

20:45.563 --> 20:47.297
Upstate where?!

20:47.330 --> 20:48.365
New York.

20:49.267 --> 20:50.234
New York?!

20:53.403 --> 20:54.238
Okay.

20:56.007 --> 20:57.175
So we're in a park.

20:58.009 --> 20:59.143
That means in the morning,

20:59.177 --> 21:01.545
there'll people walking their
dogs

21:01.579 --> 21:04.749
or jogging or something, right?

21:06.617 --> 21:07.919
Yeah, I guess.

21:09.787 --> 21:11.488
So we'll wait for help.

21:11.521 --> 21:13.658
The keys are here, I'm telling
you.

21:15.458 --> 21:17.261
These long hauls are killing my
brain.

21:17.295 --> 21:19.197
We just gotta look harder.

21:19.230 --> 21:21.666
Let me just get back
out there and find them.

21:21.699 --> 21:24.068
Oh, so now you know where they
are?

21:24.101 --> 21:27.705
No, but I know they are not
back here.

21:27.738 --> 21:29.273
So, no, no, we're not going
out

21:29.307 --> 21:31.474
in the open to look for them.

21:31.508 --> 21:35.378
So we're just gonna
sit and wait in here,

21:35.412 --> 21:37.215
when I could find the keys right
now

21:37.248 --> 21:38.850
and get us the hell out of here?

21:42.253 --> 21:43.087
Okay.

21:44.387 --> 21:46.958
You mind filling me in on
what's actually going on?

21:49.160 --> 21:50.261
Give me the lantern.

21:52.495 --> 21:53.463
It's right there.

22:15.385 --> 22:17.355
Ignore the expiration date.

22:17.387 --> 22:18.656
Jerky never goes bad.

22:27.497 --> 22:28.599
Emergency bag?

22:30.301 --> 22:32.003
Those have come in handy
before.

22:36.674 --> 22:38.876
Do you need anything else?

22:38.910 --> 22:40.745
The clothes off my back perhaps?

23:08.940 --> 23:09.774
Hey!

23:14.211 --> 23:15.613
This isn't my shit.

23:15.646 --> 23:17.447
What are you doing?

23:17.480 --> 23:19.383
I'm looking for a tablet or
something

23:19.417 --> 23:20.985
so I could call for help.

23:21.018 --> 23:23.187
People don't pack that
kinda stuff on moving trucks.

23:23.220 --> 23:24.487
You're wasting your time.

23:25.455 --> 23:27.291
Are you gonna help me repack
those?

23:32.229 --> 23:34.198
Do you have any hotdogs?

23:34.231 --> 23:35.800
Maybe we can have a barbecue.

23:35.833 --> 23:37.335
- Stop!
- Stop what?

23:37.368 --> 23:38.769
Stop trying to be funny!

23:51.782 --> 23:52.683
That bat won't stop me

23:52.717 --> 23:55.019
if you put a single scratch on
my truck.

23:56.486 --> 23:59.023
My husband put every cent
he had into this truck.

23:59.957 --> 24:02.093
I'm not about to let
some stranger ruin it.

24:14.605 --> 24:15.606
All right.

24:16.474 --> 24:18.009
Yeah, nice try.

24:18.042 --> 24:18.976
Not buying it.

24:33.557 --> 24:36.794
I'm gonna have to ask
you to get off my truck.

24:36.827 --> 24:37.661
Now.

24:42.299 --> 24:43.533
You heard me. Out.

24:46.237 --> 24:47.371
I'm sorry.

24:47.405 --> 24:48.672
Too late for that shit.

24:49.539 --> 24:51.809
I said, outta my truck.

24:51.842 --> 24:53.377
You don't know what I've been
through.

24:53.411 --> 24:54.912
I don't give a shit.

24:54.945 --> 24:56.614
Were you actually kidnapped

24:56.647 --> 25:00.251
or was this some elaborate plan
to rob me?

25:00.284 --> 25:03.087
I swear, I was fucking
kidnapped.

25:04.055 --> 25:07.358
I don't know where I am,
I don't know what to do,

25:07.391 --> 25:09.427
I just need a place to hide.

25:14.131 --> 25:14.965
Please.

25:17.868 --> 25:19.270
I don't know what I'm doing.

25:24.175 --> 25:25.009
Please.

25:27.011 --> 25:27.812
Get up.

25:39.990 --> 25:40.991
What's your name?

25:41.025 --> 25:42.561
- Phoebe Beenum.
- Look at me.

25:43.928 --> 25:45.529
What happened to you?

25:45.564 --> 25:46.363
I was kidnapped.

25:46.397 --> 25:48.699
When? Tell me the date again.

25:48.732 --> 25:50.034
June 3rd.

25:50.067 --> 25:52.269
And why should I
believe any of this shit

25:52.303 --> 25:53.504
after the stunt you pulled?

25:53.537 --> 25:54.672
I swear!

25:54.705 --> 25:56.073
You want my help now?

25:56.107 --> 25:57.576
Really?

25:57.608 --> 25:59.110
Get the hell off of my truck.

25:59.143 --> 26:01.312
Please. I can't go back.

26:16.193 --> 26:17.695
Don't let that get infected.

26:21.232 --> 26:22.567
Show me your cut.

26:25.636 --> 26:26.704
Well, that's nothing.

26:27.705 --> 26:29.340
I took a year of nursing school.

26:30.674 --> 26:31.909
Just keep pressure on it.

26:38.516 --> 26:41.051
Look, it seems like
you've been through a lot.

26:42.186 --> 26:43.622
And I wanna be on your side.

26:45.055 --> 26:48.359
But now you have to
tell me what's going on.

26:51.462 --> 26:52.296
All right.

26:54.599 --> 26:55.432
Okay.

26:57.868 --> 27:02.873
When I was 17, my friend-

27:04.108 --> 27:05.309
What was that?

27:07.211 --> 27:08.712
Oh, my god.

27:08.746 --> 27:10.114
It's the wind.

27:10.147 --> 27:10.981
Relax.

27:12.716 --> 27:13.551
It's nothing.

27:16.220 --> 27:17.354
That wasn't the wind.

27:21.492 --> 27:22.326
He's here.

27:23.861 --> 27:24.962
It could be anybody.

27:25.896 --> 27:27.798
He's here. I need to hide.

27:32.136 --> 27:33.103
Okay. Hide.

28:33.497 --> 28:34.898
Get outta here!

28:45.909 --> 28:46.745
Hello?

28:50.114 --> 28:50.948
Hey.

28:51.949 --> 28:52.850
You wanna tell me what
the hell

28:52.883 --> 28:54.251
you were doing on my truck?

28:56.220 --> 28:57.288
What?

28:57.321 --> 29:00.692
We thought we heard
someone locked in the back.

29:00.725 --> 29:03.861
Yeah. Yeah, we were just
trying to help.

29:04.763 --> 29:06.964
This truck is private
property.

29:06.997 --> 29:08.767
We're just here to
drink a couple of beers,

29:08.799 --> 29:10.200
look at the stars, you know?

29:11.235 --> 29:12.970
Stargazing and breaking and
entering

29:13.003 --> 29:15.439
are two completely different
things.

29:15.472 --> 29:16.608
I almost hit you with my bat.

29:16.641 --> 29:18.542
I was scared outta my mind.

29:19.744 --> 29:21.945
Look, our bad. You know,
getting pretty late anyway.

29:21.979 --> 29:24.683
Think we're just gonna head
outta here.

29:24.716 --> 29:26.283
Yeah, what time is it anyway?

29:29.754 --> 29:30.588
Late.

29:31.690 --> 29:32.956
Oh, hey.

29:32.990 --> 29:34.258
Can I use your cellphone?

29:35.225 --> 29:39.296
Mine's all, it's all busted
up and I'm stranded here.

29:40.297 --> 29:41.532
Yeah, sure.

29:41.566 --> 29:44.868
Reception's usually pretty
spotty out here, but...

29:45.903 --> 29:46.937
Shit.

29:46.970 --> 29:48.906
You guys are saving my ass.

29:48.939 --> 29:50.307
Thank you.

29:50.341 --> 29:51.475
Yeah. Good service.

29:53.210 --> 29:54.579
What's the number? I'll dial it
for you.

29:54.612 --> 29:55.747
I just gotta call 9-1-1.

29:55.780 --> 29:56.748
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:56.781 --> 29:59.249
What are you calling the cops
for?

29:59.283 --> 30:02.986
Oh, sorry, I guess I should
explain.

30:03.822 --> 30:06.123
I'm just trying to get some
help.

30:06.156 --> 30:06.990
Are you okay?

30:07.858 --> 30:08.727
Long story.

30:10.227 --> 30:13.464
I don't care what you're up to
this late

30:13.497 --> 30:14.766
and I don't care what you
were doing on my truck.

30:14.799 --> 30:17.067
I won't mention you to the
police.

30:17.101 --> 30:18.469
I just need it for a minute.

30:20.170 --> 30:21.573
Dude, looks like she really
needs it.

30:21.606 --> 30:24.074
Come on, let's give it
to her for a minute.

30:27.612 --> 30:28.445
All right.

30:29.446 --> 30:31.014
Just make it quick, lady.

30:31.048 --> 30:32.817
Ah, boys.

30:32.851 --> 30:33.984
Thank you so much.

30:34.017 --> 30:36.086
Just don't wander off too far.

30:40.023 --> 30:43.695
Hey, you're
cool with that, right?

31:06.083 --> 31:10.421
9-1-1. What's your
emergency?

31:15.526 --> 31:17.060
Is anyone there?

31:17.094 --> 31:18.128
Dude, what the fuck are you
doing?

31:18.162 --> 31:19.864
She's carrying a fucking bat.

31:19.898 --> 31:21.599
What? She seems harmless.

31:21.633 --> 31:22.567
Look at her, she's just-

31:22.600 --> 31:23.735
- What, when she's going like
this in our-

31:23.768 --> 31:25.102
- Oh, come on.

31:32.509 --> 31:33.812
What the fuck?!

31:33.845 --> 31:35.946
Dude! Hey, I told
you not to go over there!

31:35.979 --> 31:37.147
Hold on one second.

31:37.181 --> 31:38.215
What did you...

31:39.516 --> 31:41.385
Give that back to me.
I didn't make the call.

31:41.418 --> 31:42.252
No way.

31:44.188 --> 31:45.489
You do this?

31:45.522 --> 31:46.957
Look, we didn't do shit, lady.

31:46.990 --> 31:48.992
I told you not to go over here.

31:49.026 --> 31:51.729
Oh, you boys are gonna pay to
fix this.

31:51.763 --> 31:53.997
Jesus, you are in big fucking
trouble.

31:54.031 --> 31:56.500
Fuck.

31:56.533 --> 31:57.936
9-1-1. What's your
emergency?

31:57.968 --> 31:59.571
Hi. Hi, so sorry about
that.

31:59.604 --> 32:00.437
Yes...

32:02.172 --> 32:04.007
I really need to use that
phone.

32:04.041 --> 32:07.679
Yeah, thank you. Have a nice
night.

32:11.181 --> 32:13.651
Look, you're definitely
not calling the cops now.

32:15.419 --> 32:20.424
Guys, I'm willing to forget
about the spray paint, okay?

32:20.457 --> 32:21.693
I really mean it.

32:21.726 --> 32:24.328
I just need to make that one
call.

32:24.361 --> 32:26.430
Should have thought
of that a minute ago.

32:28.700 --> 32:30.735
Come on, we'll just
get outta here, you know?

32:30.768 --> 32:31.603
Wait.

32:32.670 --> 32:35.239
Are you really just not gonna
help me out?

32:35.272 --> 32:36.674
I mean, I'm stuck here.

32:36.708 --> 32:38.509
How about you guys call the cops
for me?

32:38.542 --> 32:39.744
That's a compromise.

32:39.777 --> 32:41.245
Lady, you're
out of your fucking mind.

32:41.278 --> 32:44.649
Can you at least just
tell them my location?!

32:45.650 --> 32:46.483
Right.

32:47.417 --> 32:49.052
I need that cell!

32:49.086 --> 32:51.321
What? You need what?

32:51.355 --> 32:52.189
Huh?

32:58.696 --> 33:01.131
What were you gonna do with
this?

33:01.164 --> 33:02.000
Huh?!

33:05.435 --> 33:06.270
Figures.

33:07.371 --> 33:08.305
Back up, lady.

33:08.338 --> 33:09.172
You hear me?

33:10.541 --> 33:11.843
Back up.

33:11.876 --> 33:13.845
Look, it's over.

33:15.245 --> 33:17.281
You win, okay?

33:17.314 --> 33:20.517
So leave and I'll forget we ever
met.

33:22.020 --> 33:24.521
Oh, what, you don't wanna
call the cops anymore?

33:28.091 --> 33:31.428
Yeah, I'd do anything
to make a quick call.

33:35.165 --> 33:36.233
Hm.

33:36.266 --> 33:39.436
Tyler, go grab the Mountain Dew.

33:47.745 --> 33:48.580
Ooh.

33:57.755 --> 33:59.557
Pour this on your head.

34:03.427 --> 34:04.261
What?

34:05.429 --> 34:08.833
Pour it on your head, and
you get to make your call.

34:08.866 --> 34:11.467
You have an important phone
call to make, don't you?

34:13.638 --> 34:14.538
Are you kidding?

34:17.909 --> 34:18.743
Your loss.

34:20.978 --> 34:21.879
Come on.

34:21.913 --> 34:23.347
I need your help.

34:23.380 --> 34:26.483
And I wanna help, okay?

34:27.851 --> 34:28.820
It's so easy.

34:31.556 --> 34:32.857
Fine.

34:32.889 --> 34:34.358
Just give me it.

34:42.033 --> 34:44.936
I do this, and I get to make
that call.

34:45.902 --> 34:47.105
I have your word, right?

35:04.622 --> 35:06.256
Oh, my god.

35:08.593 --> 35:10.460
Oh, my god.

35:10.494 --> 35:13.497
All right, give me the phone.

35:13.530 --> 35:14.364
Oh, no. No way.

35:14.398 --> 35:16.701
You're fucking gross and sticky
icky.

35:17.568 --> 35:18.502
Guys, come on.

35:19.503 --> 35:21.039
You gave me your word.

35:26.978 --> 35:28.579
Hey, yo, Tyler, dude.

35:31.115 --> 35:34.852
Don't you have a drug test
for that new job tomorrow?

35:38.455 --> 35:39.389
Oh, shit.

35:39.423 --> 35:40.758
Shit, you're right, dude.

35:40.792 --> 35:41.826
Yeah. Fuck.

35:41.859 --> 35:43.861
Yeah. Shit, what
are you gonna do, man?

35:45.129 --> 35:45.930
I'm fucked.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.234
What?

35:54.005 --> 35:55.272
Lady, what's your name?

35:56.708 --> 35:57.875
Doesn't fucking matter.

35:57.909 --> 35:59.509
What's your fucking name?!

36:02.180 --> 36:03.147
Dawn.

36:03.181 --> 36:05.382
Oh, Dawn. It sounds
like an old lady name.

36:07.819 --> 36:09.087
Fuck.

36:09.120 --> 36:12.255
All right, well, listen, Dawn,

36:13.558 --> 36:16.994
my buddy over here completely
forgot about his drug test,

36:17.028 --> 36:20.131
and you do wanna see him get the
job...

36:22.365 --> 36:25.235
It's my career we're talking
about here.

36:25.268 --> 36:27.504
But, you know, he's
squeaky clean and all,

36:27.537 --> 36:32.176
but it would be great, just
great, to have a backup.

36:34.011 --> 36:36.114
I already poured the soda on
my head.

36:36.147 --> 36:36.981
I know. I know.

36:37.014 --> 36:38.448
I know. I know, it was great.

36:41.886 --> 36:44.756
All you need to do is fill up
that bottle,

36:44.789 --> 36:46.190
and you can make your call.

36:47.491 --> 36:48.325
I promise.

36:50.427 --> 36:51.528
Let's make it quick.

36:54.198 --> 36:55.432
What, you can go into the woods.

36:55.465 --> 36:56.868
I mean, we won't watch.

36:56.901 --> 36:58.870
We're not pervs or anything.

36:58.903 --> 37:00.705
Come on, dude. Speak for
yourself.

37:01.639 --> 37:04.942
But, nah, no one wants to see
that shit.

37:04.976 --> 37:05.877
Come on, guys.

37:05.910 --> 37:07.712
I'm not asking, Dawn.

37:15.019 --> 37:17.855
Don't run off, all right?

37:17.889 --> 37:19.389
Got my eye on you.

37:53.423 --> 37:54.659
Hurry up, Dawn!

37:55.827 --> 37:57.562
Don't have all night!

38:07.939 --> 38:11.042
Don't.

38:15.913 --> 38:16.747
Aww.

38:17.615 --> 38:18.716
Aww.

38:18.749 --> 38:20.952
A deal's a deal.

38:20.985 --> 38:22.720
She fucking did it.

38:22.753 --> 38:23.721
No. Whoa, whoa.

38:23.754 --> 38:24.655
No. Gross.

38:24.689 --> 38:26.891
You got it all over the sides
and shit.

38:26.924 --> 38:28.358
That's fucking gnarly, dude.

38:28.391 --> 38:30.027
What, you can't aim too well,
huh?

38:37.869 --> 38:39.303
The phone, now.

38:42.607 --> 38:44.141
And what do we get in return?

38:45.576 --> 38:47.111
You're kidding me.

38:47.144 --> 38:49.247
The piss!

38:49.280 --> 38:50.348
We made a deal.

38:51.682 --> 38:54.451
You know, I can't believe
you actually fucking did it.

38:54.484 --> 38:56.654
You're a lunatic, you know that?

38:58.289 --> 39:00.625
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

39:01.559 --> 39:03.828
Why can't you just help us?

39:03.861 --> 39:04.762
You're terrible.

39:06.764 --> 39:07.832
Little shits!

39:10.902 --> 39:12.003
Who's "us"?

39:14.471 --> 39:15.573
I'm done with this.

39:17.440 --> 39:20.211
What do you mean "us"?

39:21.279 --> 39:22.647
Is there someone else here?

39:24.815 --> 39:27.184
I told you, I'm done.

39:27.218 --> 39:29.153
Dawn, come on.

39:30.520 --> 39:32.356
You're telling me you
don't got some pretty girl

39:32.390 --> 39:33.925
just lying around in the back?

39:39.931 --> 39:43.466
If you're looking for Phoebe,
she left.

39:44.635 --> 39:45.468
Oh, yeah?

39:47.437 --> 39:48.339
Where did she go?

39:49.907 --> 39:53.711
I mean, she's not in trouble or
anything,

39:53.744 --> 39:58.749
but we just wanna talk.

40:08.392 --> 40:09.226
Phoebe!

40:10.394 --> 40:11.228
Phoebe!

40:12.430 --> 40:13.564
Phoebe!

40:13.597 --> 40:15.199
- She left!
- Woo-ooh!

40:16.167 --> 40:17.835
- Anybody back there?!
- Please, just go away.

40:17.868 --> 40:18.703
Huh?!

40:21.439 --> 40:23.941
You're done with this when
I say you're done with this.

40:25.142 --> 40:27.544
That's what little shits do,
don't they?

40:31.682 --> 40:33.751
Get on your knees.

40:33.784 --> 40:34.618
Fuck you.

40:41.926 --> 40:42.860
Lie down.

40:45.629 --> 40:46.564
Lie down!

40:46.597 --> 40:48.432
Dude, don't do anything
stupid.

40:48.466 --> 40:49.767
Just shut the fuck up, man.

40:49.800 --> 40:50.835
Get back there.

40:57.942 --> 40:59.343
You want us to go away, huh?

41:02.013 --> 41:03.848
Beg, and we're gone.

41:05.016 --> 41:07.351
- Zach.
- Just shut the fuck up!

41:17.461 --> 41:18.929
Beg.

41:18.963 --> 41:19.764
Help.

41:33.177 --> 41:34.011
Get up.

41:36.414 --> 41:37.248
Get up!

41:42.486 --> 41:43.587
Get up.

41:43.621 --> 41:44.555
Get the bat, Tyler.

41:54.965 --> 41:59.970
Well, Dawn, it's been fun.

42:02.773 --> 42:04.108
Please stay in touch.

42:04.141 --> 42:06.977
And we're gonna dip now.

42:09.413 --> 42:10.681
Try following us though,

42:12.450 --> 42:15.086
and it won't be good.

42:28.199 --> 42:33.104
Bye.

42:58.829 --> 42:59.763
You okay?

43:03.167 --> 43:08.172
Those kids were a nightmare,
but they're gone now.

43:09.540 --> 43:10.374
Kids?

43:13.177 --> 43:14.011
Your age.

43:15.412 --> 43:16.247
You're safe now.

43:17.314 --> 43:18.849
How am I safe?

43:20.551 --> 43:22.486
They won't be coming back.

43:22.520 --> 43:23.588
I told them you left.

43:25.624 --> 43:27.424
He's still out there.

43:27.458 --> 43:28.392
He left.

43:29.628 --> 43:32.196
That psychopath and his
friend went on their way.

43:33.731 --> 43:37.168
I don't know who these kids
are, but that wasn't him.

43:39.436 --> 43:41.038
What do you mean?

43:41.071 --> 43:42.840
The guy who took me was your
age.

43:45.209 --> 43:48.613
What?

43:48.647 --> 43:50.047
Why didn't you tell me that?

43:51.515 --> 43:54.586
I was an inch away from
having my brains splattered

43:54.619 --> 43:55.920
across the side of my truck,

43:55.953 --> 43:58.689
and you're telling me that
wasn't the guy who took you?

44:00.024 --> 44:01.392
I begged!

44:02.259 --> 44:04.461
I was on the fucking ground

44:04.495 --> 44:07.898
begging in front of two
children trying to help you out.

44:09.601 --> 44:10.669
I had no idea.

44:10.701 --> 44:11.869
I'm sorry.

44:11.902 --> 44:12.736
For what?

44:13.771 --> 44:15.039
For what happened.

44:15.072 --> 44:15.906
Oh, good.

44:16.874 --> 44:18.709
So you're not sorry for hiding
in the dark

44:18.742 --> 44:21.580
while I was doing everything
I could to keep you safe.

44:24.181 --> 44:26.350
I thought it was him. I'm
sorry.

44:26.383 --> 44:28.552
If you were sorry, you would
have,

44:28.587 --> 44:30.721
I don't know, poked your head
out,

44:30.754 --> 44:32.823
instead of just sitting in here!

44:32.856 --> 44:34.458
I didn't know what was going
on.

44:34.491 --> 44:35.893
I froze up.

44:35.926 --> 44:38.996
Yeah, that seems to be your
go-to.

44:41.532 --> 44:42.433
What are we doing?

44:43.934 --> 44:45.637
There is no one coming for you.

44:45.670 --> 44:49.273
All you're doing is destroying
my husband's business.

44:49.306 --> 44:50.575
I'm just trying to survive.

44:50.609 --> 44:53.010
I'm trying not to spend the rest
my life

44:53.043 --> 44:54.945
rotting in someone's basement.

44:54.979 --> 44:58.048
- I was taken-
- No one is coming for you!

44:59.783 --> 45:01.485
Do you understand that?

45:03.387 --> 45:04.989
Wanna know what needs to happen?

45:06.423 --> 45:07.524
I need to sleep.

45:09.393 --> 45:12.731
And you, you need real help.

45:14.999 --> 45:18.902
Honestly, I'm sorry if your
story is true.

45:19.970 --> 45:23.874
You do whatever you need to
do, but I'm going to bed.

45:26.810 --> 45:31.650
Please, just give me a minute
and I'll explain everything.

45:35.519 --> 45:37.821
All right, I'm all ears.

45:43.327 --> 45:45.396
It was seven years ago.

45:46.430 --> 45:47.831
I was a senior in high school,

45:47.865 --> 45:51.703
and we were just trying
to have a good time.

45:51.736 --> 45:52.671
You were so loud.

45:52.704 --> 45:54.371
You're lucky we didn't get
caught.

45:55.239 --> 45:57.742
I didn't think the door
was gonna be so creaky.

46:02.580 --> 46:04.582
Watch and see how it's done.

46:06.483 --> 46:07.719
Shotty. You're driving to
Josh's.

46:07.752 --> 46:09.253
I thought we were walking.

46:09.286 --> 46:10.555
- Walk?
- Hell no.

46:10.588 --> 46:11.955
I'm gonna snag the keys.

46:12.856 --> 46:15.292
My dad's not gonna care
'cause he won't find out.

46:16.661 --> 46:18.896
Relax, I'll be right back.

46:18.929 --> 46:21.198
Okay. Remember, it's the clear
one.

46:21.231 --> 46:23.400
Yeah, I know what vodka looks
like.

46:23.434 --> 46:24.703
Thanks.

46:24.736 --> 46:26.970
Your dad's gonna flip
a shit if he wakes up.

46:27.004 --> 46:29.106
If he wakes up, I'll just
tell him I wanted to sleep

46:29.139 --> 46:30.441
in my own bed or something.

46:30.474 --> 46:32.142
Phoebe, just chill, okay?

46:32.176 --> 46:33.745
It just doesn't feel
like the smartest idea

46:33.778 --> 46:35.512
to break the law in a judge's
house.

46:35.546 --> 46:36.947
Relax, my Dad's cool.

46:38.650 --> 46:39.651
Just kidding.

46:39.684 --> 46:41.118
Okay, Whit, stop stalling.

46:41.151 --> 46:42.554
We'll keep watch.

46:43.688 --> 46:45.422
Good luck.

47:10.749 --> 47:12.584
How's Project Absolut going?

47:12.617 --> 47:15.552
The Eagle is making
its way back to the nest.

47:15.587 --> 47:19.156
Houston, we are ready for
takeoff.

47:19.189 --> 47:22.259
Text the fellas we are a go.

47:23.595 --> 47:24.928
Oh, God damn it.

47:26.497 --> 47:28.532
You okay there, Eagle?

47:29.400 --> 47:30.200
Yeah.

47:30.234 --> 47:31.068
Coming.

48:26.825 --> 48:27.659
Whitney!

51:56.601 --> 51:57.969
Hey, let me out!

52:10.048 --> 52:11.481
Why are you doing this to me?

53:23.286 --> 53:24.789
Help!

55:07.524 --> 55:09.627
I was within my rights.

55:11.361 --> 55:12.697
I had no choice.

55:19.971 --> 55:21.305
I had no choice.

56:21.265 --> 56:22.633
It's not my fault.

56:22.667 --> 56:24.168
It's not my fault.

56:54.699 --> 56:55.933
No, no, no, no!

59:31.522 --> 59:32.690
Hello?

59:58.816 --> 01:00:00.317
I can't go back.

01:00:06.591 --> 01:00:07.424
That's it.

01:00:08.459 --> 01:00:09.460
Holy shit.

01:00:11.362 --> 01:00:12.897
Holy shit.

01:00:14.098 --> 01:00:15.099
You poor thing.

01:00:17.434 --> 01:00:19.103
What do you think we should
do?

01:00:20.304 --> 01:00:21.539
I'm gonna go find those keys.

01:00:21.573 --> 01:00:22.406
No.

01:00:23.474 --> 01:00:25.709
Don't bring any attention to the
truck.

01:00:25.743 --> 01:00:27.646
He's out there looking for me.

01:00:28.846 --> 01:00:30.414
Well...

01:00:31.282 --> 01:00:32.249
Fuck.

01:00:35.452 --> 01:00:38.255
We should be safe as long
as we stay put, I guess.

01:00:41.258 --> 01:00:42.594
What was that?

01:01:04.616 --> 01:01:06.651
The floor's creaky.

01:01:06.685 --> 01:01:07.518
Phoebe?

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.354
Phoebe.

01:01:25.402 --> 01:01:28.640
So, Dawn of Nate's Haul-n-Go,
thanks.

01:01:36.146 --> 01:01:38.482
Any decent human being
would have done the same.

01:01:42.286 --> 01:01:44.455
So this is your company?

01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:47.791
Yeah, my company.

01:01:50.995 --> 01:01:53.030
That's pretty cool.

01:01:53.063 --> 01:01:55.266
Well, my husband died.

01:01:55.299 --> 01:01:56.133
What?

01:01:57.768 --> 01:01:59.571
I wasn't supposed to be a
trucker.

01:02:00.504 --> 01:02:02.006
This is my husband's business.

01:02:04.141 --> 01:02:05.442
Nate loved this truck.

01:02:07.544 --> 01:02:11.148
And when he died, I had to step
in to keep the money flowing

01:02:11.181 --> 01:02:14.018
and, you know, take care of my
daughter.

01:02:14.051 --> 01:02:14.885
You know?

01:02:16.954 --> 01:02:18.922
It's just moving shit from place
to place.

01:02:18.956 --> 01:02:20.491
Driving around alone.

01:02:22.326 --> 01:02:23.127
I hate it.

01:02:27.464 --> 01:02:29.500
Actually never said that out
loud before.

01:02:34.104 --> 01:02:36.775
Oh, yeah, Nate loved this thing.

01:02:38.342 --> 01:02:40.144
He would spend hours on end with
it.

01:02:41.812 --> 01:02:44.683
I'd say to him, "Honey,
you're spending too much time

01:02:44.716 --> 01:02:46.183
with that damn truck."

01:02:48.552 --> 01:02:52.523
And now, look at me, spending
every waking hour with it.

01:03:09.206 --> 01:03:10.775
You guys look happy.

01:03:16.046 --> 01:03:16.880
Nice bracelet.

01:03:19.116 --> 01:03:19.950
Thanks.

01:03:21.952 --> 01:03:23.320
It was Whitney's, actually.

01:03:26.457 --> 01:03:27.692
I like your belt.

01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:36.433
Your parents must be a wreck.

01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:42.039
Nah, my mom passed away when
I was still in high school

01:03:42.072 --> 01:03:45.476
and I haven't spoken
to my father in years.

01:03:48.045 --> 01:03:50.114
I don't think he's called
me since I moved out.

01:03:51.583 --> 01:03:52.483
Where to?

01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:54.485
Portland, Oregon.

01:03:55.352 --> 01:03:56.487
You live in Portland?

01:03:57.955 --> 01:04:01.392
Yeah, I grew up right outside
in a town called Beaverton.

01:04:01.425 --> 01:04:02.660
Wow.

01:04:04.061 --> 01:04:05.062
Small world.

01:04:05.963 --> 01:04:08.332
I live an hour away
from there in Silverton.

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:13.203
Yeah, I met Nate in college
and followed him out there,

01:04:13.237 --> 01:04:14.938
when I was just around your age.

01:04:16.173 --> 01:04:17.107
Haven't left since.

01:04:18.643 --> 01:04:19.778
Huh, that's wild.

01:04:21.078 --> 01:04:21.945
Yeah.

01:04:21.979 --> 01:04:22.814
Crazy.

01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:28.152
You mind if I close my eyes
for a few?

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:36.895
You sure you're okay?

01:04:40.799 --> 01:04:43.000
You're a badass, you know that?

01:04:46.838 --> 01:04:48.005
Going through what you went
through

01:04:48.038 --> 01:04:49.607
and then getting yourself here?

01:04:51.609 --> 01:04:54.011
You're like a warrior
princess or something.

01:05:59.109 --> 01:06:01.545
I'd
never wanna hold you back.

01:06:01.579 --> 01:06:04.949
You have to keep living your
life.

01:06:14.592 --> 01:06:15.425
Promise me.

01:07:35.472 --> 01:07:36.473
This is the couch?

01:07:38.342 --> 01:07:40.277
This is his couch?

01:07:40.310 --> 01:07:41.779
Whose stuff are you moving?

01:07:43.881 --> 01:07:46.316
His name's Cass Rodick.

01:07:49.186 --> 01:07:51.355
What's happening?

01:07:51.388 --> 01:07:53.256
- Oh, God damn it.
- Are you shitting me?

01:07:53.290 --> 01:07:54.424
I gotta get outta here.

01:07:54.458 --> 01:07:56.126
Hey, hey, hey.

01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:59.129
Deep breaths, okay? We're okay.

01:07:59.162 --> 01:08:00.031
I gotta go.

01:08:00.064 --> 01:08:01.431
No, whoa, whoa.

01:08:01.465 --> 01:08:03.467
We're still a needle in a
haystack.

01:08:05.168 --> 01:08:07.639
Who were you on the phone with
before?

01:08:07.672 --> 01:08:08.505
What?

01:08:09.741 --> 01:08:12.442
When I first found you, who
were you on the phone with?

01:08:12.476 --> 01:08:14.277
I was talking to him.

01:08:14.311 --> 01:08:15.379
Mr. Rodick?

01:08:15.412 --> 01:08:16.246
Yeah.

01:08:17.814 --> 01:08:19.249
You told him where we are.

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:23.755
You said the state park.

01:08:31.828 --> 01:08:33.564
You have to get outta here.

01:08:35.033 --> 01:08:36.000
What are you doing?

01:08:36.033 --> 01:08:38.770
I don't know, but you
should take something

01:08:38.803 --> 01:08:40.470
to defend yourself.

01:08:40.504 --> 01:08:41.872
You've gotta come with me.

01:08:41.906 --> 01:08:44.609
No, no, I should stay
with the truck, right?

01:08:44.642 --> 01:08:46.343
And that way, if he comes
looking for you,

01:08:46.376 --> 01:08:48.746
I can steer him in the wrong
direction.

01:08:48.779 --> 01:08:49.881
No, we gotta stick together.

01:08:49.913 --> 01:08:51.849
You don't know what he's capable
of.

01:08:51.883 --> 01:08:52.884
Come on, we can go through the
woods.

01:08:52.917 --> 01:08:54.685
No. No, you leave.

01:08:55.819 --> 01:08:57.921
I'm gonna find those keys.

01:08:57.955 --> 01:08:59.523
Yes.

01:08:59.557 --> 01:09:00.892
If we just keep running,

01:09:00.925 --> 01:09:03.127
we'll run into someone
eventually, right?

01:09:03.161 --> 01:09:04.562
No, you know what, if I find
them,

01:09:04.595 --> 01:09:06.631
I'll haul ass and I will find
help.

01:09:06.663 --> 01:09:07.932
Are you listening to me?!

01:09:07.965 --> 01:09:09.366
You can't be here!

01:09:10.868 --> 01:09:13.403
I told him there was a
girl here asking for help.

01:09:19.542 --> 01:09:22.046
If he comes, I'll tell
him we called for help,

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.380
and that the police came

01:09:23.412 --> 01:09:24.649
and picked you up and took you
away.

01:09:24.682 --> 01:09:26.818
He'll know something's up.

01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:28.452
I'd rather die than go back
there.

01:09:28.484 --> 01:09:29.587
No! No, he won't!

01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:31.388
He won't know shit!

01:09:33.523 --> 01:09:34.357
Fine.

01:09:35.926 --> 01:09:36.993
Fine.

01:09:37.028 --> 01:09:38.095
Yeah, all right. Okay.

01:09:38.129 --> 01:09:38.930
- So-
- Fuck.

01:09:38.962 --> 01:09:40.529
You good? You got this?

01:09:42.133 --> 01:09:44.669
- I think so.
- Okay, you just stay low

01:09:44.702 --> 01:09:45.703
and you keep moving.

01:09:46.904 --> 01:09:47.738
Okay?

01:09:49.006 --> 01:09:50.108
You got this.

01:09:55.245 --> 01:09:58.548
Listen.

01:09:58.583 --> 01:10:00.785
You gotta be fucking
kidding me.

01:10:01.686 --> 01:10:02.519
Shh.

01:10:05.757 --> 01:10:06.591
He's here.

01:10:11.294 --> 01:10:12.295
I'll distract him.

01:10:13.263 --> 01:10:14.232
I will leave the gate open.

01:10:14.264 --> 01:10:18.202
The second you think
you can, you run for it.

01:10:55.372 --> 01:10:56.841
Mr. Rodick?

01:10:59.043 --> 01:11:00.011
Hey, Dawn.

01:11:02.146 --> 01:11:03.313
Hey, what are you doing here?

01:11:03.346 --> 01:11:04.582
I wasn't expecting you.

01:11:05.683 --> 01:11:10.487
Oh, I was just checking
in on you and my stuff.

01:11:13.423 --> 01:11:15.259
Tried calling you half a dozen
times,

01:11:15.293 --> 01:11:18.763
but you seem like you were in
such a panic

01:11:18.796 --> 01:11:20.298
and then you just hung up.

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.533
Oh, that.

01:11:23.568 --> 01:11:25.837
Look, you remember that
girl I told you about

01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:27.738
who was asking for help?

01:11:27.772 --> 01:11:29.707
She tried to use my
phone and she broke it.

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:31.075
Oh, wow.

01:11:31.108 --> 01:11:31.943
Yeah.

01:11:32.844 --> 01:11:33.678
She okay?

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:37.782
I mean, didn't get much info
from her.

01:11:37.815 --> 01:11:40.517
She was here and then got
picked up by the police.

01:11:42.352 --> 01:11:44.889
Oh, wow, cops.

01:11:46.456 --> 01:11:47.291
That's great.

01:11:50.161 --> 01:11:51.262
How did they find you?

01:11:54.632 --> 01:11:55.465
What?

01:11:56.868 --> 01:11:58.769
I thought you said your phone
broke?

01:12:00.905 --> 01:12:02.106
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:12:02.139 --> 01:12:06.244
Well, she called right before
I was on the phone with you.

01:12:08.312 --> 01:12:09.146
Huh.

01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:13.184
Okay.

01:12:18.122 --> 01:12:19.123
What's with the bat?

01:12:21.592 --> 01:12:24.128
Sorry, it's late.

01:12:24.161 --> 01:12:25.495
And you had me nervous.

01:12:32.370 --> 01:12:34.739
Ow, when did this happen?

01:12:35.806 --> 01:12:37.041
Happened when I was sleeping.

01:12:37.074 --> 01:12:38.376
Do you wanna hit the road?

01:12:39.542 --> 01:12:42.980
If we leave now, we'll be right
on time.

01:12:43.014 --> 01:12:44.849
Oh, why's the truck left wide
open?

01:12:50.621 --> 01:12:52.556
It's a mess back here.

01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:56.426
I went over a pothole and I
heard some things fall over.

01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:58.829
I tried to clean up a bit,

01:12:58.863 --> 01:13:01.599
but I guess I didn't do such a
great job.

01:13:01.632 --> 01:13:03.367
Of course, I'll discount the
invoice

01:13:03.401 --> 01:13:04.602
once we finish the trip.

01:13:18.883 --> 01:13:19.717
Oh, well.

01:13:21.218 --> 01:13:23.287
If you don't mind finishing up
now,

01:13:23.321 --> 01:13:25.923
I'll grab some tape from
my car and we'll head out.

01:14:23.748 --> 01:14:24.849
So how I can help?

01:14:28.285 --> 01:14:29.320
Oh, no worries.

01:14:30.321 --> 01:14:31.722
This is what you pay me for.

01:14:33.958 --> 01:14:36.060
I'll let you know when I'm
ready to get back on the road.

01:14:36.093 --> 01:14:37.028
Oh, don't be silly.

01:14:37.061 --> 01:14:38.129
I'm happy to help.

01:14:40.064 --> 01:14:45.069
I guess maybe if you don't
mind picking this stuff up?

01:14:46.003 --> 01:14:47.271
Sure thing. No problem.

01:14:58.082 --> 01:14:58.916
Anything else?

01:15:00.618 --> 01:15:04.255
Yeah, can I get that tape?

01:15:14.899 --> 01:15:15.800
She still here?

01:15:21.272 --> 01:15:23.107
You don't have to be
involved in any of this.

01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:24.442
Just tell me where she is.

01:15:26.777 --> 01:15:27.845
Come on, Dawn.

01:15:30.014 --> 01:15:32.116
She deserves what's coming to
her.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.254
I don't know what you're
talking about.

01:15:37.288 --> 01:15:38.656
All I want is justice.

01:15:39.623 --> 01:15:40.825
You can understand that.

01:15:42.593 --> 01:15:47.198
My family paid the price for
what she did.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:50.634
Why shouldn't she suffer too?

01:15:53.237 --> 01:15:57.408
I'm not sure what happened
to your family, but I'm sorry.

01:16:05.349 --> 01:16:07.318
I'll ask you one more time.

01:16:07.351 --> 01:16:08.385
Where is-

01:17:21.058 --> 01:17:22.526
Dawn.

01:17:22.561 --> 01:17:24.128
Dawn, are you okay?

01:21:09.987 --> 01:21:10.822
Come on.

01:21:12.356 --> 01:21:13.157
Fuck!

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.855
Dawn!

01:22:59.162 --> 01:22:59.998
Dawn!

01:23:04.067 --> 01:23:04.903
Dawn!

01:23:06.704 --> 01:23:08.205
It's over!

01:23:08.238 --> 01:23:09.239
Come on out!

01:23:10.975 --> 01:23:13.645
This has nothing to do with you!

01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:28.026
Dawn, where are you?!

01:23:28.927 --> 01:23:30.427
I just wanna talk!

01:23:34.097 --> 01:23:35.800
Let's figure this out like
adults!

01:23:42.539 --> 01:23:44.042
Don't wanna fight!

01:23:46.076 --> 01:23:47.311
Let me explain!

01:23:49.112 --> 01:23:50.414
Phoebe is gone!

01:23:50.447 --> 01:23:51.448
She ran off!

01:23:53.317 --> 01:23:54.518
It's just the two of us!

01:23:54.551 --> 01:23:55.687
Come on, Dawn!

01:23:58.590 --> 01:24:00.758
I have no problem with you!

01:24:28.452 --> 01:24:29.286
Dawn?!

01:24:46.303 --> 01:24:49.040
Don't believe a
word Phoebe said!

01:24:50.808 --> 01:24:51.976
Come on, Dawn!

01:24:52.844 --> 01:24:53.678
Come out!

01:24:56.848 --> 01:24:58.916
Don't be a fucking bitch!

01:25:00.450 --> 01:25:05.455
You're starting to piss me off!

01:25:11.629 --> 01:25:14.197
Is that what you fucking want?!

01:25:48.166 --> 01:25:49.634
That gun isn't loaded.

01:25:51.869 --> 01:25:55.472
I found your bullets.

01:26:05.850 --> 01:26:07.517
I had to bury my only
daughter.

01:26:13.624 --> 01:26:14.726
It was all your fault.

01:26:26.838 --> 01:26:28.371
How do you live with the guilt?

01:26:34.544 --> 01:26:35.378
Huh?!

01:26:42.153 --> 01:26:44.354
Just pretend like it didn't
happen?!

01:26:49.627 --> 01:26:50.561
You did this.

01:26:52.362 --> 01:26:54.832
No, I didn't.

01:26:57.702 --> 01:26:59.003
Then whose fault is it?

01:27:07.578 --> 01:27:09.680
Why didn't you say something,
that night,

01:27:11.414 --> 01:27:13.785
when you saw me pointing
a gun at my daughter?

01:27:20.024 --> 01:27:21.324
It all happened so fast.

01:27:28.633 --> 01:27:30.433
My family doesn't exist
anymore.

01:27:32.904 --> 01:27:34.605
My job doesn't exist anymore.

01:27:34.639 --> 01:27:35.472
I...

01:27:48.853 --> 01:27:50.721
Why do you get to move on so
quickly?

01:27:54.357 --> 01:27:59.329
What about me?!

01:28:01.232 --> 01:28:06.369
It's taken me seven years
to finally restart my life.

01:28:06.403 --> 01:28:10.141
Just give me your phone,
and we can both move on.

01:28:17.347 --> 01:28:18.249
Shoot me.

01:28:22.519 --> 01:28:24.454
Just end it now.

01:28:31.428 --> 01:28:32.263
Do it.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:36.801
Do it!

01:29:14.205 --> 01:29:15.039
You lied.

01:29:17.608 --> 01:29:22.346
You're a liar.

01:29:26.584 --> 01:29:27.852
Don't move.

01:29:36.894 --> 01:29:37.728
Hey!

01:30:01.152 --> 01:30:02.954
Let me out! Let me out!

01:30:02.987 --> 01:30:03.955
No!

01:32:22.755 --> 01:32:27.755
