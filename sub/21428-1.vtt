00:06.339 --> 00:10.760
[upbeat music]

00:13.346 --> 00:14.973
I think it's really dangerous

00:15.056 --> 00:17.767
to seek personal fulfillment
through romantic relationships.

00:18.059 --> 00:18.935
I do.

00:19.019 --> 00:22.021
I'm just letting you know. FYI.

00:22.105 --> 00:22.981
Uh...

00:23.064 --> 00:25.108
You shouldn't need other people
to validate or define you.

00:25.442 --> 00:26.526
I shouldn't?

00:26.943 --> 00:28.653
No, you shouldn't. Nobody should.

00:28.737 --> 00:29.988
Oh, yeah. No. Totally.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.701
-Can I get you something to drink?
-[Jessica] No, thank you.

00:34.784 --> 00:36.244
Drinking is basic AF.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.079
Oh, yeah. I guess.

00:38.413 --> 00:39.664
I'll get you some waters.

00:39.748 --> 00:40.999
-[Jessica] Thank you.
-Awesome.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.126
-Totes presh.
-Totes presh.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.170
-What?
-Totes presh.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.171
So, uh...

00:46.629 --> 00:48.339
-have you been on Tinder long or...
-All right.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.507
I'm gonna stop you right there

00:49.591 --> 00:51.885
because I'm not loving the whole vibe
of this interaction so far.

00:51.968 --> 00:53.928
And I would literally
rather have my period

00:54.012 --> 00:55.805
for a thousand years, non-stop,

00:55.889 --> 00:57.557
than continue this portion
of the conversation.

00:57.640 --> 00:58.475
Huh?

00:58.558 --> 01:00.894
You mentioned something earlier
about wanting to bone?

01:01.728 --> 01:04.272
-Oh. Yeah. Yeah.
-See right here on Tinder, we matched.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.190
-Right.
-Awesome.

01:05.272 --> 01:07.150
And then, I texted you, "Hi."

01:07.233 --> 01:09.694
And you said, "S'up?"
And I was like, "Not much."

01:09.778 --> 01:12.322
-And then you said, "Want to bone."
-"Want to bone?" I guess I did.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.324
-Do you remember that?
-I... I guess I do. Yeah.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.576
So, did you come here tonight
expecting to bone?

01:19.704 --> 01:21.164
-Yes.
-It's not gonna happen.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.666
Well, what happened?
Did I do something wrong?

01:23.750 --> 01:24.626
Kind of.

01:24.709 --> 01:26.920
It's like, when I walked in,
you just shook my hand.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.671
Well, what should I have done?

01:28.755 --> 01:30.256
I don't know. Maybe you should have, like,

01:30.340 --> 01:31.549
grabbed me by the shoulders,

01:31.633 --> 01:33.718
and whispered something real sexy
in my ear.

01:34.093 --> 01:36.054
-Like what?
-[Jessica] Like...

01:36.137 --> 01:39.974
"Go in the bathroom
and take off your panties.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.226
I want to smell 'em."

01:41.309 --> 01:43.436
And you would have done that
if I told you to do that?

01:43.520 --> 01:45.605
Maybe. I don't know.

01:45.688 --> 01:48.274
There's a huge chance I would have
just punched you in your ding-a-ling.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.317
[Jessica] But who knows?

01:49.400 --> 01:52.487
Sort of in this weird transitional phase
in my life

01:52.570 --> 01:54.823
where I don't know what I'm gonna do next.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.283
-I'm going through a really bad breakup.
-[man] Oh.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.451
-Yeah. It sucks.
-Yeah.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.870
That's really the only reason
why either of us are here right now.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.997
-What does that mean?
-He usually comes on Fridays.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.542
So I was hoping
that he'd catch us together,

02:05.625 --> 02:06.626
and then he would freak out

02:06.709 --> 02:08.294
-and be like super devastated.
-Wait, what?

02:08.919 --> 02:10.338
Oh, my God. He's here. He's here.

02:10.420 --> 02:12.465
-He's here right now.
-Are you kidding? He's here now?

02:12.549 --> 02:15.802
Oh, frick me. He's brought a date,
and she's super-hot.

02:15.885 --> 02:17.470
I didn't even know
he liked girls like that.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.430
-Don't turn around!
-Well, what do you want me to do?

02:19.514 --> 02:20.932
I don't know.
Act like we're gonna have sex later.

02:21.015 --> 02:22.267
How do you act like
you're going to have sex?

02:22.350 --> 02:24.060
Be sexual. Do you want me
to have to figure this out for you?

02:24.144 --> 02:24.978
-Figure it out.
-I...

02:25.061 --> 02:25.895
Hey, Jess.

02:25.979 --> 02:26.813
Hey, Damon.

02:27.188 --> 02:29.023
[Jessica]
It's great to see you've moved on already.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.151
After only two-and-a-half months
of not dating.

02:31.609 --> 02:34.028
Three-and-a-half months, actually. But...

02:34.362 --> 02:35.363
Hi. I'm Heather.

02:35.446 --> 02:36.573
I'm sure you are.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.242
What's that supposed to mean?

02:39.325 --> 02:40.535
-You tell me.
-[Damon] Yeah. Um...

02:40.618 --> 02:41.995
We're gonna go eat outside.

02:42.078 --> 02:44.831
-But, um, nice to see you, Jess. Honestly.
-[Jessica] Mm-hm.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.708
Wish I could say the same to you.
But I can't.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.960
Because you broke my heart
into a million little pieces.

05:04.345 --> 05:06.597
[car horn honking nearby]

05:13.813 --> 05:15.064
[Jessica]  Take a deep breath in.

05:16.607 --> 05:18.443
And out.
[exhales]

05:18.526 --> 05:19.652

And out.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.203

05:29.370 --> 05:31.039
Right at your sides.

Oh, boy.

[children laughing]

05:34.876 --> 05:35.710
Okay.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.920
Now, close your eyes.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.631
I want you to imagine
that you're on the beach.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.717
-What beach?
-Any beach.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.343
San Diego Beach?

05:44.427 --> 05:47.472
That would be included
in the options for any beach, yes.

05:47.555 --> 05:48.931
I hate beaches.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.268
Okay. Just imagine it anyway.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.020
[Jessica exhales]

05:54.103 --> 05:57.482
It's a sunny day.
There's a sweet breeze in the air.

06:00.276 --> 06:04.363
You take off your shoes
and you wiggle your toes in the sand.

[yawns]

06:06.616 --> 06:08.284
Did I bring sunscreen?

06:08.367 --> 06:10.411
No, you didn't. But your mom did.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.121
And she's rubbing it on your back
right now.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.248
[birds chirping]

06:14.540 --> 06:15.875
[Jessica] Tell me what you see.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.460
-Water.
-[Jessica] Good.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.170
Is it calm? Or are there waves?

06:19.253 --> 06:20.296
Waves.

06:20.379 --> 06:22.256
[waves lapping]

06:22.340 --> 06:23.674
Tell me what you hear.

06:24.425 --> 06:26.177
I hear the waves?

06:28.888 --> 06:30.098
I don't hear anything.

06:30.181 --> 06:33.601
That's okay. Just relax and try.

06:34.936 --> 06:35.978
[Jessica] What do you smell?

06:36.062 --> 06:37.855
-Suntan lotion.
-Salt.

What do you feel?

06:42.193 --> 06:43.152
Good.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.237
Warm.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.905
-Hungry.
-Happy.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.615
I don't feel anything.

06:47.698 --> 06:48.616
Well, what's that like?

06:48.699 --> 06:49.700
[Shandra] I don't know.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.953
It doesn't feel like anything?

06:52.745 --> 06:54.580
[sighs]
All right, let's try something else.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.874
I want you to think about feeling nothing.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.459
And, I mean, really think about it.

06:58.543 --> 07:01.045
And I want you to write a paragraph on it
for class next week.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.422
Four sentences minimum.
Do you think you can do that?

07:03.506 --> 07:04.924
Do I have to?

07:05.007 --> 07:06.509
This is theater, Shandra.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.177
We don't have to do any of this.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.222
We do it simply because we must.

07:12.014 --> 07:12.932
What?

"Oh, nothing.
We're just collectively responsible

for the success
of every major dramatic writer

in the past 100 years."

[funky music]

08:13.534 --> 08:15.286
[Jessica]
I can get over us not being together.

08:15.369 --> 08:16.621
Really, I can.

08:16.704 --> 08:19.749
Look at me.
I'm tall, I'm pretty, I'm smart.

08:19.832 --> 08:21.292
I am a coco queen.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.503
Obviously,
I will have many great loves in my life.

08:23.836 --> 08:24.837
It's just...

08:25.671 --> 08:28.174
I feel like I lost my best friend
and it really sucks.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.219
-Are those for the guests?
-[Jessica] Yes.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.804
All right. So, we're done here?

08:35.056 --> 08:36.432
-[Tasha] Hi.
-Hi.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.850
-What are you doing?
-Oh, yes.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.434
-This is exactly what I want.
-No, no, no.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.977
We're supposed to be serving this stuff.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.313
-It's so good.
-Mm-hm.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.774
You know, when you invited me
to come here,

08:45.566 --> 08:48.027
I thought I would be a guest, not serving.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.530
It's $500 a ticket.
And I thought you needed the money.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.907
-Oh, I do need the money.
-You're gonna get us both fired.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.993
Relax, girl. These are my people.
I'm mingling.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.579
Okay, this is like, old money,
theater-subscribing Manhattan.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.665
These are so not your people.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.667
Have you been talking to them about Damon?

09:05.002 --> 09:07.088
Yeah, yeah, but...

09:07.547 --> 09:10.716
I'm going through a process right now.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.093
Okay, I'm standing in my own truth.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.887
-Dude, you need to get out.
-I am out.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.181
No, no, you need to go on a date.
A real one.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.101
Ew, no. Dating's the worst.
Have you ever actually seen a man eat?

09:20.184 --> 09:21.686
Like, there's never been a grosser thing.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.145
I've seen a live birth before.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.023
And it's still not close to a man
eating a piece of chicken.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.025
Oh, my God! I actually know somebody.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.610
-Is he cute?
-[Tasha] Yes.

09:29.694 --> 09:30.528
What's his deal?

09:30.611 --> 09:31.445
He's divorced.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.197
Tasha, there has never been a redder flag.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.242
It's perfect. You guys can just rebound
right off of each other.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.287
On to each other and into each other,
and just like...

09:39.370 --> 09:41.622
-Are you talking about sex?
-[Tasha] Hetero-ing... Yes.

09:42.331 --> 09:44.834
-[Jessica] How old is he?
-Thirty. Tops. Maybe just a little older.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.252
And he's already failed at marriage?

09:46.335 --> 09:49.630
So, what? Life is just a series
of failures in the first place. So...

09:52.425 --> 09:53.676
-What?
-What?

09:55.469 --> 09:56.429
He is nice.

-You'll have fun.
-[Jessica] I don't want to have fun.

[soft piano music playing]

-[Damon] You ready?
-[Jessica] Yeah, I'm ready.

10:08.566 --> 10:13.154
You're about to win the award
for best playwright ever of all time.

10:13.237 --> 10:15.448
Really? I don't even know
they made that award.

10:15.531 --> 10:16.866
Well, they just made it for you.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.075
-For me?
-[Damon] Mm-hm.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.828
-Oh, my gosh. Thank you, everybody.
-[Damon] Mm-hm.

10:20.911 --> 10:23.331
So, we're at the ceremony
[chuckles]

10:23.414 --> 10:25.458
and you don't know you're about to get it.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.501
-What do I think we're here for?
-[Damon] I don't know.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.045
-[Damon]  Hamilton?
-[Jessica]  Keep going.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.338
[Damon]  Then, Oprah comes out.

10:30.880 --> 10:35.217
And she announces to the whole world
that you are the best playwright

10:35.301 --> 10:37.887
- in the history of the universe.
-[Oprah]  In the history of the universe.

10:37.970 --> 10:38.929
And you turn to me, and...

10:39.013 --> 10:40.473
Hey, Oprah knows my name!

10:40.556 --> 10:42.099
[crowd cheers]

10:42.183 --> 10:43.100
Oprah knows my name.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.852
Oprah knows my name!

10:45.102 --> 10:46.520
-[Damon] So...
-I like this future.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.564
-[Damon] It's pretty cool, right?
-Yeah.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.293
[munching]

11:13.756 --> 11:16.425
[Boone] So, um, Tasha tells me
you're a playwright.

11:17.259 --> 11:19.512
Yeah. I write plays.
That's something that I do.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.181
Have you written anything
I might have seen?

11:22.264 --> 11:24.350
[Jessica sighs]
Do you see a lot of plays?

11:26.852 --> 11:28.145
Did you write  Hamilton?

11:29.355 --> 11:30.231
Have you seen  Hamilton?

11:30.314 --> 11:31.148
-No.
-[Jessica] No.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.400
No, I didn't write  Hamilton.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.944
I haven't had a play produced in New York.

11:35.027 --> 11:35.903
[Boone] Oh.

11:36.779 --> 11:39.740
I have had interest from a small handful
of theater companies, though.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.326
And they want to work with me, so...

11:43.369 --> 11:44.745
I'm just waiting.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.039
Right place, right time,
so I can make my mark.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.459
I don't know anything about theater.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.461
It's pretty much all I care about.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.629
Well, that's great.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.923
That you're committed
to something you love.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.049
Why did you get divorced?

11:57.133 --> 11:59.510
That's a pretty brutal transition.
Don't you think?

11:59.593 --> 12:01.846
No offense, but I don't even know
if I wanna be here right now.

12:01.929 --> 12:04.140
Oh, wow, why would I be offended by that?

12:04.223 --> 12:06.142
I don't know,
Tasha thought this would be good for me.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.269
To help me get over this guy
I thought I was in love with.

12:08.352 --> 12:11.480
But, to be honest, this whole thing
is making me think of him more intensely.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.731
[Boone] Oh, yeah? How so?

12:12.815 --> 12:15.067
I'm just really reminded
of how much of him you're not.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.278
Cool.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.157
I mean, I get it.

12:22.158 --> 12:22.992
Um...

12:23.617 --> 12:26.745
You are the complete opposite
to my ex-wife.

12:26.829 --> 12:29.039
What is she? Dumb, short, and fugly?

12:30.791 --> 12:31.834
What I meant was...

12:33.043 --> 12:35.838
compared to her, you are much more...

12:36.755 --> 12:37.673
forthright.

12:37.756 --> 12:39.800
Honesty is, like, the only thing
that matters to me.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.887
Oh, yeah. I believe in honesty.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.346
-[Jessica] Really?
-Mm-hm.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.765
So, can we be totally honest
with each other?

12:48.017 --> 12:48.851
Absolutely.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.103
[clinks]

12:52.062 --> 12:52.897
[soft thud]

12:57.359 --> 12:58.402
Why are you here?

12:59.069 --> 13:01.822
Well, it's been a little while
since my divorce. Bleh.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.867
And I thought if this went well,
then we could make out later.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.494
You just want to make out?

13:08.329 --> 13:11.207
Why did you say that you think
you were in love with your ex?

13:11.790 --> 13:13.209
I don't know. It's complicated.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.629
We were together for two years,
and then he just sort of gave up on us.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.631
I'm sorry. That must be rough.

13:19.715 --> 13:20.591
Why did you get married?

13:20.674 --> 13:23.093
I think I was in a hurry
to get on with my life.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.303
What went wrong?

13:24.386 --> 13:25.804
I'm still figuring that out.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.682
But I'm pretty sure it was her fault.

13:28.766 --> 13:29.850
[laughs]

13:30.643 --> 13:31.852
You have a great smile.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.271
What's your go-to karaoke song?

13:34.355 --> 13:36.440
I do not care for karaoke.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.943
Really? Boo, dude.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.653
You're booing me when I'm being honest?

13:40.736 --> 13:42.613
You're right. I'm sorry. That was rude.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.782
How do you pay your rent?

13:45.199 --> 13:47.868
I work at a non-profit in Hell's Kitchen.

13:48.369 --> 13:51.080
I teach public school kids how to write
and produce their own plays.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.373
So, how do you pay your rent?

13:52.456 --> 13:54.667
[laughs]

13:54.750 --> 13:58.420
I, uh, I live in deep Bushwick.
Like, deep, deep, deep Bushwick.

13:59.463 --> 14:00.381
What about you?

14:00.714 --> 14:02.049
I invented an app.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.051
[heavy sigh]

14:07.346 --> 14:08.264
Thank you.

14:11.767 --> 14:15.646
Okay, well, thanks. This was interesting.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.023
In, like, an anthropological way.

14:18.899 --> 14:20.234
I'm gonna take that as a compliment.

14:20.317 --> 14:21.151
Oh.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.112
Yeah, I guess you could.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.074
Look, I don't want to disappoint you
or anything, but...

14:28.325 --> 14:29.535
I don't think we should make out.

14:30.077 --> 14:32.621
Don't worry. I gave up on that idea
halfway through the meal.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.624
I enjoyed being honest with you.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.795
-That's the only way to be, so...
-[Boone] All right.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.214
Well, good night.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.633
Oh, we're hugging. Good night.

14:46.510 --> 14:47.386
[Jessica snickers]

14:47.970 --> 14:49.555
-Are you going this way, too?
-Yeah.

14:49.638 --> 14:50.890
That's awkward.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.268
I wouldn't say this is any more
or less awkward

14:54.351 --> 14:55.603
than every other part of the night.

14:55.686 --> 14:56.854
[Jessica laughs]

14:58.022 --> 14:59.023
That's funny.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.441
You're funny.

15:00.858 --> 15:01.859
Yeah.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.279
I'm also good at cunnilingus.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.532
Well, that's good to know.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.121
So, which way do you go now?

Nothing you do matters to anyone.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.859
-It feels like you don't exist."
-[Jessica] Wow.

16:26.193 --> 16:28.237
That was amazing.
That was really well put.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.614
Shandra, do you feel like that a lot?

16:31.615 --> 16:32.616
I don't know.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.327
Has anybody in this room
ever felt like that?

16:35.411 --> 16:36.453
Raise your hand if you have.

16:40.874 --> 16:43.877
Girl, you just articulated
a pretty complicated feeling

16:43.961 --> 16:46.296
that everybody in this room can relate to.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.340
[Jessica] How does that make you feel?

16:49.341 --> 16:50.259
Uh...

16:50.342 --> 16:52.177
Hey, everybody, guess what?

16:52.261 --> 16:53.512
-What?
-What?

16:53.595 --> 16:55.431
This is your one and only life.

-Yeah?
-Yeah, I made a lot of mistakes.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.182
I should have never let you go.

Damon, this is literally so crazy.
Please come off the ledge.

17:42.978 --> 17:44.438
I can't. I won't go on without you.

You're being so melodramatic right now.
I live on the second floor.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.109
I need to tell you how I feel.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.361
Okay. Fine. How do you feel?

17:51.445 --> 17:53.280
I... I don't know.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.534
You hurt me a lot. You know that, right?

17:57.618 --> 17:59.912
I know. I know, okay? I'm an asshole.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.386
Yeah, like, right now.
Like, usually, always.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.514
It's kind of been your thing
ever since we first met.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.140
Well, why didn't you tell me this before?

18:20.224 --> 18:22.226
I don't know. I guess I didn't
wanna hurt your feelings.

18:22.309 --> 18:23.936
But, you know, here we are.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.188
Well, what else did you want to tell me?

Um...

18:29.316 --> 18:31.026
You're not as funny as you think you are.

I'm getting a lot of inquiries
regarding your status.

19:30.752 --> 19:33.005
Yeah. It's my raw feminine energy.

19:33.630 --> 19:36.383
It really fucks up the room.

what most of the girls are saying.

are you rocking with these days?

Hm?

19:59.406 --> 20:01.158
I need some recommendations.

You mean, like,
what is the one vibrator I'm using?

20:04.036 --> 20:06.830
-[Jessica] Yeah.
-Do you only have one vibrator?

20:07.789 --> 20:09.416
Do you have more than one vibrator?

20:09.499 --> 20:12.878
Uh, has one man ever fulfilled
all of your needs?

20:13.921 --> 20:15.047
There was one.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.049
-Hm.
-[Jessica] Bullshit aside.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.468
He was pretty dope at sex.

Oh, how did the date go
with the divorced dude?

20:25.224 --> 20:27.392

I spent the night with him.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.687

20:30.771 --> 20:32.272
Yeah, you said he was cool.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.982
Yeah, no, I don't actually know him
that well.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.235
I only did it
because you said you knew him.

20:36.318 --> 20:39.238
No, I just acted in a diversity workshop
at a retreat for his app.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.216
Well, let me know if you wanna make out

into helping you transition.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.303
You know, just to see how it feels.

21:03.637 --> 21:07.557
Appreciate it, but I'm going to stick
with this basic peen for a while.

21:07.641 --> 21:08.475
[Tasha] Mm.

in his role-playing

22:14.583 --> 22:16.626
Marriage is an outdated social construct
anyway.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.920
-I don't care. I don't care.
-[Kayla] I don't care.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.381
[snaps finger]
[Jessica] I don't care. I don't care.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.466
I don't care.

22:22.966 --> 22:25.052
All right, guys, great job today.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.970
Also, don't forget
that I need your permission slips

22:27.054 --> 22:28.346
for our writer's weekend coming up.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.849
And I haven't gotten anything from anybody
except for Shandra.

22:30.932 --> 22:32.642
Seriously, don't forget
to ask your parents.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.145
Or I will do it myself.
I will make it weird.

22:35.228 --> 22:36.688
Kayla? Seriously.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.232
Hey, Ms. James?

22:40.150 --> 22:41.109
Hey.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.110
[Jessica] You okay?

22:42.194 --> 22:44.196
I can't go to the writer's weekend.

22:44.780 --> 22:45.614
What? Why?

22:45.697 --> 22:48.158
Shandra, no, you're the only one
who turned in your permission slip.

22:48.241 --> 22:49.493
I'm sorry.

22:50.285 --> 22:52.120
Is somebody coming to pick you up?

22:52.496 --> 22:53.622
I wanna see... Oh, there it is.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.166
Excuse me. Are you Shandra's mom?

22:57.042 --> 22:57.876
Yeah.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.878
Hey, I'm Jessica James.

23:00.170 --> 23:01.379
I know who you are.

23:02.297 --> 23:05.300
All right, uh, Shandra mentioned
something to me earlier

23:05.383 --> 23:07.636
about her possibly not making
the writer's weekend next month?

23:07.719 --> 23:09.721
-Yeah, that's right.
-She cannot miss that weekend.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.306
Well, unfortunately, she has to.

23:11.389 --> 23:14.017
-[Jessica] Why?
-It's complicated.

23:14.309 --> 23:17.020
It's just that it's a really big deal.
Sarah Jones is gonna be there.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.773
Look, I don't know who Sarah Jones is,
but Shandra can't go.

23:19.856 --> 23:22.818
[Jessica] She's an amazing playwright.
She, like, won a Tony.

23:22.901 --> 23:26.279
Do me a favor, when you get home,
google Sarah Jones  TED Talk .

23:26.363 --> 23:29.116
-Okay. Come on.
-Seriously, why can't she make it?

23:30.283 --> 23:32.119
Well, if you must know,

23:32.202 --> 23:35.122
Shandra's dad is taking her
and her brother to Six Flags that weekend.

23:36.373 --> 23:37.499
I'm sorry, Shandra's mom.

23:37.582 --> 23:39.334
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

23:39.417 --> 23:41.002
It's her dad's weekend.

23:41.419 --> 23:43.797
This is the weekend
where they actually write their plays.

23:43.880 --> 23:47.467
You know how long it took
to reach a custody agreement with my ex?

23:47.843 --> 23:48.844
Two years.

23:49.386 --> 23:53.014
[Mrs. Phillips]
Two years, six lawyers, and $34,000.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.851
We just signed an agreement last week.

23:56.351 --> 23:57.811
He gets that weekend.

23:58.436 --> 23:59.855
Do you mind if I talk to him?

24:00.313 --> 24:02.315
You're kind of an annoying person,
aren't you?

24:04.276 --> 24:05.277
Yes.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.946
[beeps]
[Jessica] Hey, uh, Mr. Phillips.

24:08.029 --> 24:10.407
This is Jessica James
from the Children's Theater Project.

24:11.241 --> 24:12.784
I was just calling because...

24:14.119 --> 24:14.995
Well, because I'm 25

24:15.078 --> 24:17.038
and I haven't been completely broken
by life yet.

24:18.498 --> 24:21.251
But also, I was hoping to try
and convince you

24:21.334 --> 24:24.296
to rethink taking Shandra to Six Flags

24:24.379 --> 24:25.881
during the writer's weekend.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.049
And I know from talking to Mrs. Phillips

24:28.133 --> 24:30.719
that you all have had a really hard time
the last couple of years

24:30.802 --> 24:32.637
and that you just reached
a custody agreement.

24:33.513 --> 24:36.266
I don't want to butt in,
but I just want to say

24:36.349 --> 24:39.227
that I kind of know
what Shandra's going through.

24:40.103 --> 24:41.730
I think it could be
really empowering for her

24:41.813 --> 24:45.650
to sort through all those really confusing
and scary emotions

24:45.734 --> 24:47.444
and turn them into something good.

24:47.527 --> 24:51.907
And, look, I know that a lot of people say
that theater is a dead art form

24:51.990 --> 24:54.659
performed by the rich
for the even richer, and...

24:54.743 --> 24:55.911
[soft chuckle]

24:55.994 --> 24:58.496
I guess I do agree with that
to some extent, but...

24:59.623 --> 25:00.957
I still really believe in it.

25:02.250 --> 25:04.294
I think it has the power
to transform lives.

25:04.377 --> 25:06.546
I mean, it completely transformed mine.

25:09.216 --> 25:12.844
So, Mr. Phillips, can you please, please
let her come to the writer's weekend?

25:12.928 --> 25:14.888
I promise you will not regret it.

25:16.556 --> 25:17.849
[phone vibrates]

25:18.600 --> 25:21.061
-Mr. Phillips?
-[Boone]  Hey. No. Uh, it's Boone.

25:21.144 --> 25:23.146
-Who?
-Yeah. We had dinner.

25:23.438 --> 25:26.483
Remember? We, um, stayed over at my place

25:26.566 --> 25:28.735
and we had dessert?

25:30.779 --> 25:31.738
The divorced guy.

25:32.447 --> 25:34.532
Oh, wow. Shit.

25:34.616 --> 25:36.534
Sorry, I forgot that was your name.

25:36.618 --> 25:39.204
No, sure, that's understandable.

25:39.704 --> 25:40.830
Uh, how are you?

25:41.164 --> 25:44.251
It's, um, kind of a weird moment for me.

25:44.334 --> 25:47.337
But... I guess I'm okay.

25:47.420 --> 25:50.257
-What about you?
-Oh, I'm great. Thanks for asking.

25:50.340 --> 25:53.051
Listen, I had a terrific time
the other night.

25:54.010 --> 25:55.720
Oh, my God. Is this a booty call?

25:56.012 --> 25:57.722
[laughs]
No.

25:58.473 --> 25:59.391
No. No.

25:59.474 --> 26:00.642
Do people still say booty call?

26:00.725 --> 26:02.477
This is totally a booty call.

26:02.686 --> 26:03.895
Oh, Boone.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.605
Okay, I guess it's kind of a booty call.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.774
But I did enjoy spending time with you.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.609
Just because you catch
a unicorn in the wild

26:09.693 --> 26:12.070
doesn't mean you get to tap it
whenever you want, buddy.

26:12.487 --> 26:13.780
Are you calling yourself a unicorn?

26:13.863 --> 26:14.948
Maybe.

26:15.615 --> 26:17.158
I didn't realize unicorns
were so arrogant.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.076
[chuckles]

26:19.160 --> 26:21.121
All right, look, we can go for a walk.

26:21.204 --> 26:23.081
But only if it's in my neighborhood.
And that's it.

26:23.164 --> 26:24.791
Okay. Cool.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.167
I'll, um, I'll take that.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.795
[Jessica]  All right. Well, don't forget.
We're just literally walking...

26:28.878 --> 26:31.172
[metal clangs]

26:31.256 --> 26:32.799
-[Jessica]  Boone, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

26:32.882 --> 26:33.967
-[Jessica]  Are you sure?
-Huh?

26:34.050 --> 26:36.428
Did some trash cans fall over on your end?
Is that your end?

26:36.511 --> 26:38.263
-[Jessica]  Ew. What?
-Oh, no, I don't know.

26:38.888 --> 26:41.558
Okay, I'll see you soon.

26:43.059 --> 26:48.398
[upbeat music]

26:51.651 --> 26:54.154
[police siren blaring in the distance]

26:56.072 --> 26:59.117
-So this is, uh, this is Bushwick, huh?
-Yeah.

26:59.659 --> 27:01.578
-It's pretty great, right?
-It's delightful.

27:02.037 --> 27:04.247
So, when are they gonna burn it down?
[laughs]

27:05.457 --> 27:07.542
Well, not all of us can afford to live
in neighborhoods

27:07.625 --> 27:09.502
where you got artisanal pickle shops
on every corner.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.588
Every person that I've seen
in this neighborhood, so far,

27:11.671 --> 27:13.089
looks like they work in a pickle shop.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.174
That is true.

27:18.553 --> 27:20.347
So, I think my wife has started seeing...

27:20.430 --> 27:22.682
My ex-wife has started seeing somebody.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.017
Oh, Boone.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.770
Is that what you wanna talk about
right now? Really?

27:26.853 --> 27:28.605
-[Jessica] Come on.
-I'm struggling.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.108
-How'd you find out?
-Fucking Instagram.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.818
-Oh, no.
-[Boone] Yeah.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.653
How many times a day
do you check her Instagram?

27:35.737 --> 27:37.697
Oh, you know, not that often.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.577
-Yeah, pretty much every waking moment.
-[Jessica] Yeah, me too.

27:43.286 --> 27:46.623
-Do you still talk to him, though?
-No. I don't want to talk to him.

27:46.706 --> 27:49.501
You just prefer to obsess
about what he's doing online?

27:49.584 --> 27:51.753
-Yeah. Yeah, I do.
-Don't think that's very healthy.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.130
Well, that's coming from a guy
who checks his ex-wife's Instagram

27:54.214 --> 27:55.256
like a thousand times a day.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.674
-Oh, true, that.
-Yeah.

27:58.885 --> 28:02.305
Hey, what do you think would happen
if you unfollowed him?

28:03.390 --> 28:04.349
I don't know.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.268
What do you think would happen
if you unfollowed her?

28:08.645 --> 28:11.022
To be honest, I'd be kind of relieved
that I didn't have to look

28:11.106 --> 28:13.149
at so many pictures of food
on my timeline.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.735
Oh, is she one of those ladies
that posts photos of food all day?

28:15.819 --> 28:17.779
It's the worst.
How could you marry somebody like that?

28:17.862 --> 28:20.615
Well, to be fair, she is an award-winning
food photographer.

28:21.408 --> 28:23.493
-Oh, that's kind of cool.
-[Boone] Yeah.

28:24.619 --> 28:27.580
Hey. I'll do it, if you do it.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.500
-Do what?
-Unfollow my ex.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.628
-Oh, are you serious?
-Yeah.

28:33.711 --> 28:36.923
Yeah, this is really good.
Actually, we should do this.

28:37.006 --> 28:38.675
That's like a really big step, Boone.

28:38.758 --> 28:41.594
No, it's just a couple of little taps.
Then, we can get on with our lives.

28:42.095 --> 28:42.929
[groans]

28:44.556 --> 28:47.559
-Okay. Fine. Fuck it, let's do it.
-You're gonna do it?

28:47.642 --> 28:49.018
-Yeah, I'm gonna do it.
-Sweet.

28:49.102 --> 28:51.187
-[Boone] Let's do it on three.
-[Jessica] Hold on.

28:52.147 --> 28:57.068
-Okay.
-[Boone] One, two, three...

28:57.819 --> 28:58.737
Bye-bye.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.447
[exhales]

29:01.990 --> 29:03.199
Okay, how do you feel?

29:04.617 --> 29:06.536
I already hate it.
[chuckles]

29:06.619 --> 29:08.872
I want to know what's going on already.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.582
[Jessica] What about you?

29:11.166 --> 29:13.626
Yeah, I've got this belly-full of regret.

29:14.711 --> 29:16.045
Oh, shit.

29:19.507 --> 29:22.761
Well, what if we followed
each other's ex's on Instagram?

29:22.844 --> 29:25.305
That way, we can tell the other person
if something big comes up.

29:25.764 --> 29:26.973
That's a really good plan.

29:27.056 --> 29:28.808
-Yeah.
-[Boone] Let's do that.

29:28.892 --> 29:31.644
-Okay, what's your fellow's name?
-At Damon Johansing.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.315
-And then what about your ex-wife?
-Mandy Moore.

29:35.398 --> 29:38.818
-Wait, what?
-Oh, it's not the singer stroke actress.

29:38.902 --> 29:39.903
It's a very common name.

29:40.487 --> 29:41.863
Holy shit. Is this him?

29:41.946 --> 29:43.865
-[Jessica] Yeah.
-[Boone] He's beautiful.

29:43.948 --> 29:44.991
I know, he's a beautiful man.

29:45.074 --> 29:46.117
-Are you kidding me?
-I know.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.036
You're never gonna get the likes
of that again.

29:48.119 --> 29:50.121
[both laughing]

29:50.205 --> 29:53.208
-[Boone] I would fuck this guy.
-[Jessica] Would you? Oh, me too.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.210
Is this her?

29:55.752 --> 29:57.337
-[Boone] Yeah.
-[Jessica] She's cute.

29:58.171 --> 29:59.672
Oh, she's blonde.

29:59.923 --> 30:02.509
-[Boone] Yeah, I'm really into blondes.
-[Jessica] Oh, sorry.

30:02.967 --> 30:05.136
[Boone] Does he make fucking
handcrafted phone cases?

30:05.220 --> 30:06.221
He does.

30:06.513 --> 30:07.764
Is there something wrong with that?

30:07.847 --> 30:09.808
Oh, no. It's just,
I really need a new phone case.

30:09.891 --> 30:11.476
Boone, we're working on boundaries
right now.

30:11.559 --> 30:13.561
There's a million places
you can get phone cases from.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.646
Yeah, okay.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.858
-He makes such pretty stuff, though.
-[Jessica] Yeah, he's really, really good.

30:19.984 --> 30:23.404
Oh, wow, she posted a beautiful photo
of a hamburger today.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.865
[Boone] Yeah, she's really knows
what to do with meat.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.492
[Jessica]
That's a weird thing to say to me.

30:27.575 --> 30:29.160
[Boone]
Oh, God. You probably thought that...

30:29.244 --> 30:30.537
No, I meant she's good with dick.

30:30.620 --> 30:31.704
[Jessica laughs]

30:31.788 --> 30:35.792
[upbeat music]

30:43.508 --> 30:44.467
[paper rustles]

30:54.644 --> 30:56.229
Tasha, are you sitting down?

30:56.312 --> 30:58.690
-[Tasha]  I'm at ease. Yeah.
-Get this.

30:58.773 --> 31:02.235
I just got a personalized rejection letter
from Tim Sanford at Playwrights Horizons.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.612
Congratulations?

31:04.863 --> 31:06.531
You don't sound that excited,
but I'll take it.

31:06.614 --> 31:08.533
Oh, I don't know. It's a rejection.

31:08.616 --> 31:10.285
Yeah, but it's a personalized
rejection letter.

31:10.368 --> 31:11.202
Get this.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.622
"Despite the eloquent and oftentimes
hilarious tone of your work,

31:14.706 --> 31:17.041
it is not right for Playwrights Horizons
at this time."

31:17.125 --> 31:19.252
Wow! That is...

31:19.669 --> 31:21.421
I don't know what that is.
What is that? That's...

31:21.504 --> 31:22.338
It's amazing.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.382
Do you know how many
form letter rejections I've gotten

31:24.465 --> 31:26.676
from lesser-known theater companies
and fellowships this year?

31:26.759 --> 31:30.179
Tim Sanford from Playwrights Horizons
read one of my plays

31:30.263 --> 31:32.265
and he gave me an encouraging response.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.100
This is huge.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.269
Oh, that is so cool.

31:36.352 --> 31:37.395
[Tasha moaning]

31:37.478 --> 31:40.189
-Are you masturbating right now?
-[Tasha]  Yeah.

31:40.273 --> 31:42.275
Okay, next time I call you
when you're doing that,

31:42.358 --> 31:44.444
-just don't answer the phone.
-[Tasha]  Okay. Good to know.

31:44.903 --> 31:48.990
[groovy music]

31:59.250 --> 32:00.501
What are you doing here?

32:01.294 --> 32:02.295
You unfollowed me.

32:03.004 --> 32:04.631
Wow. That was fast. How did you know?

32:04.714 --> 32:08.801
I only have 70 followers on Instagram
and Twitter, combined, so...

32:08.885 --> 32:11.346
-Yeah, you are not good at social media.
-[Damon] I make phone cases.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.473
All right, I don't have clever,
witty ideas

32:13.556 --> 32:16.017
that I like to share with the world
like everybody else.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.727
I just don't understand
why you unfollowed me.

32:17.810 --> 32:19.896
Well, Damon, it's not like
we're together anymore.

32:20.313 --> 32:22.482
So, what? That means we can't be friends
on Facebook?

32:23.691 --> 32:26.444
No, I don't think we can.
No. No, we cannot.

32:26.736 --> 32:27.737
I don't get it.

32:27.820 --> 32:30.198
I don't get it, how one minute
we can be in love,

32:30.281 --> 32:31.908
and the next minute
we're less than strangers.

32:31.991 --> 32:33.076
What, you're asking me?

32:33.159 --> 32:34.077
Yes. I'm asking you.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.954
I don't know.
I didn't think it'd be big of a deal.

32:36.037 --> 32:37.747
Really? You unfollowed me.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.707
I guess, secretly, I kind of hoped
that you would notice,

32:39.791 --> 32:41.542
but I didn't want you
to get all bent out of shape about it.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.378
It feels like deep down,
you wish we never would've met.

32:43.461 --> 32:44.629
I guess I kind of wish we hadn't met.

32:44.712 --> 32:46.005
-[Damon] No, don't do that.
-I do.

32:46.089 --> 32:47.465
Don't negate everything we had

32:47.548 --> 32:49.300
just because you don't like
the way it ended.

32:49.384 --> 32:50.510
Well, why not?

32:50.593 --> 32:52.512
-Because it was good.
-And then it wasn't.

32:52.595 --> 32:54.889
Well, why do you think that is?

32:55.974 --> 32:58.101
-I don't know. You tell me.
-[Damon] Oh, wow!

32:58.184 --> 32:59.102
You act so...

32:59.185 --> 33:02.855
You don't realize how frustrating it is,
how stubborn,

33:02.939 --> 33:05.441
-and hardheaded you are sometimes.
-I am not stubborn.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.610
Okay, do you want me
to explain to you why it ended?

33:07.694 --> 33:10.029
Yeah, that would be most excellent
if you could.

33:10.113 --> 33:10.947
Okay.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.366
It ended because you...

33:13.449 --> 33:14.867
[piano thuds]

33:18.371 --> 33:19.205
What?

33:21.499 --> 33:22.500
[exhales]

33:30.591 --> 33:31.843
[sighs]

33:38.307 --> 33:39.559
[birds chirping]

33:39.642 --> 33:41.227
[Jessica]  All right, everybody, listen up.

33:41.310 --> 33:42.687
This is Tasha.

33:42.770 --> 33:43.896
Tasha is an actress,

33:43.980 --> 33:45.773
and she's gonna teach you guys
an improv game.

33:46.024 --> 33:49.444
Thank you so much, Jess,
for that amazing introduction.

33:50.236 --> 33:51.320
[Tasha] Okay.

33:51.404 --> 33:54.198
Um, as was mentioned five seconds earlier,

33:54.282 --> 33:59.287
I'm Tasha and I'm going to teach you
an improv game called, "Yes, And..."

33:59.370 --> 34:01.289
Has anybody ever heard
of "Yes, And..." before?

34:03.666 --> 34:05.960
Perfect! Okay, well, it is super simple.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.295
All you have to do is agree with anything
that your partner says

34:08.379 --> 34:09.213
by saying "yes."

34:09.297 --> 34:11.049
And then, adding something to it.

34:11.132 --> 34:13.551
Jessica, would you like
to help me demonstrate?

34:13.634 --> 34:16.846
Yes. And I would also like to add
that this game rules.

34:16.929 --> 34:18.806
Yes. This game does rule.

34:18.889 --> 34:23.186
And I'm excited to play it
because your class is super attractive.

34:23.268 --> 34:24.478
[children laughing]
[Jessica] Yes.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.272
And on top of being very attractive,

34:26.355 --> 34:28.649
they also have really,
really great brains.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.359
Yes. They have great brains.

34:30.443 --> 34:34.030
And I can tell because I just so happen
to be a brain-eating zombie

34:34.112 --> 34:36.949
who loves kids' brains.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.701
[Jessica] Yes. I knew that.
[children laughing]

34:38.784 --> 34:40.911
And I have something to tell you.

34:40.995 --> 34:42.663
I'm a zombie slayer.
[Tasha gasps]

34:43.331 --> 34:44.581
Yes, you are.

34:44.665 --> 34:47.126
And we have a long feud going back...

34:47.502 --> 34:50.630
centuries, and centuries, and centuries.
[Jessica laughing]

34:50.713 --> 34:53.174
[Jessica] Yes, and for some reason,
we always seem to run in circles

34:53.257 --> 34:54.801
which is why we've been feuding
for so long.

34:54.884 --> 34:58.471
Yes, this is a cosmic dance
between two people.

34:58.554 --> 35:00.598
[Jessica] Two people who don't know
how to fight.

35:00.681 --> 35:04.393
I am your archenemy!
But I came here today to tell you...

35:04.936 --> 35:06.229
that I love you.
[Jessica gasps]

35:06.312 --> 35:09.023
[upbeat music]

35:24.372 --> 35:26.707
[phone vibrating]

35:26.999 --> 35:28.251
-Hello?
-[Boone]  Hey.

35:28.334 --> 35:29.710
-It's Boone.
-Who?

35:29.794 --> 35:31.462
Just kidding. I know who you are.
What's up?

35:31.921 --> 35:34.715
[chuckles]
I was just, um, calling to let you know

35:34.799 --> 35:36.801
that Damon finally started watching
The Sopranos

35:36.884 --> 35:38.845
and he thinks it's pretty good.

35:38.928 --> 35:40.054
Okay. All right.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.848
That's really useful information
for me to know.

35:41.931 --> 35:43.224
Thank you very much for telling me.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.476
I don't know what took him so long.
It's a really great show.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.103
I don't know.
I feel like if I want to watch

35:47.186 --> 35:48.855
a bunch of morally corrupt dudes
do some stuff,

35:48.938 --> 35:51.482
I could just, like, literally,
leave my apartment at any given moment.

35:51.566 --> 35:53.484
[laughs]
Yeah, men are horrible.

35:53.568 --> 35:56.320
Oh, my gosh. By the way,
I am loving your ex-wife's Instagram.

35:56.612 --> 35:57.905
Her photos were so good.

35:58.489 --> 36:01.367
Food photography really is an art.
It's just the dabblers I don't care about.

36:01.450 --> 36:05.913
Yeah. Food porn
is one of my top two favorite porns.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.331
What's your other favorite porn?

36:08.958 --> 36:09.834
Human.

36:09.917 --> 36:11.669
That is a good porn.
That's a good form of porn.

36:11.752 --> 36:15.506
Also, um, I was wondering
what you were up to this weekend?

36:15.590 --> 36:16.716
You were, were you?

36:17.175 --> 36:19.635
Yes, I was, I was.
[Jessica laughs]

36:20.887 --> 36:24.432
I, um, I'm actually gonna be in Ohio
for my little sister's baby shower.

36:24.891 --> 36:26.809
Oh, a lot of new information there.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.811
What, you're from Ohio?

36:28.895 --> 36:30.521
Yes. I am, unfortunately.

36:31.063 --> 36:33.482
It's weird I know more
about your ex-boyfriend than I do you.

36:34.650 --> 36:35.985
Yeah. I guess it is, huh?

36:37.862 --> 36:38.779
Maybe...

36:38.863 --> 36:43.201
um, when you get back into town,
we could go on a real date?

36:43.868 --> 36:46.162
Well, that depends, Boone.
What's your idea of a real date?

36:47.246 --> 36:48.706
Hot dogs and laser tag?

36:48.789 --> 36:50.458
-Um, I'm busy.
-I'm joking.

36:50.541 --> 36:51.959
Something brilliant.
[Jessica chuckling]

36:52.043 --> 36:53.169
No, we'll, um...

36:53.794 --> 36:55.880
We'll have a great time, I promise.

36:57.089 --> 36:58.132
Yeah, sure.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.593
I'll go on a real date with you.
It sounds fun-ish.

37:00.676 --> 37:02.887
Oh, okay. Well, thanks.

37:04.430 --> 37:06.265
[laughing]
Can you just give me a call

37:06.349 --> 37:07.975
when you're back into town?

37:08.059 --> 37:10.102
And, uh, bring me back some potatoes.

37:10.186 --> 37:12.313
-That is Idaho.
-Yes, it is.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.565
Do they grow anything in Ohio?

37:15.524 --> 37:16.442
Just weirdos.

37:16.525 --> 37:18.694
Well, bring me back some weirdos.

37:18.778 --> 37:19.612
Will do.

37:19.695 --> 37:21.447
-Bye, Jessica.
-Bye.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.283
[Mandy's boyfriend] Boone?

37:25.952 --> 37:27.078
Who wants to know?

37:27.161 --> 37:28.496
[Mandy's boyfriend] Look, man, I...

37:28.579 --> 37:30.539
I don't want to make this weird
or anything, but, um...

37:31.749 --> 37:34.085
Mandy sent me down here
to see if you want to, like,

37:34.168 --> 37:36.796
come upstairs and talk or something.

37:36.879 --> 37:38.381
[Boone] What? Why?

37:38.464 --> 37:41.467
[Mandy's boyfriend] We saw you out here
circling around the block, it's...

37:42.802 --> 37:43.678
It's sad, man.

37:43.761 --> 37:44.720
I'm what...

37:48.599 --> 37:50.559
Well, you can tell Mandy

37:50.643 --> 37:54.814
that I happen to be on the phone,
arranging a date with a girl, a woman,

37:55.398 --> 37:58.317
who is a wonderful playwright from Ohio.

37:59.485 --> 38:01.445
I didn't even know
that I was in your neighborhood.

38:01.904 --> 38:03.656
Yeah, no, I'm not gonna tell her
any of that.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.911
Fine. Don't tell her. I don't give a shit.

38:08.995 --> 38:11.289
You know, she still has a great deal
of affection for you.

38:11.372 --> 38:12.498
Oh, she does, does she?

38:12.581 --> 38:14.292
She still has a great deal
of affection for me?

38:14.375 --> 38:15.209
Yes.

38:16.252 --> 38:17.336
Did she say that?

38:17.420 --> 38:18.963
Hey, look, I know it's hard, man.

38:19.046 --> 38:21.590
I went through a divorce myself
a couple of years ago.

38:23.217 --> 38:24.802
I didn't... I didn't realize.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.638
I'm sorry. What did you say your name was?

38:27.722 --> 38:29.390
Oh, that's right. I don't give a shit.

38:31.267 --> 38:32.685

You don't even know.

[chuckles]

39:36.540 --> 39:38.292
[Jessica's mom]
It's like all she can talk about.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.210
[Kenny] Yeah.

39:39.335 --> 39:42.213
Well, it's not every day we get a visit
from our big city girl.

39:42.296 --> 39:44.590
Please do not call me "big city girl,"
Kenny.

39:46.133 --> 39:48.219
We missed you at Christmas.

39:49.637 --> 39:51.263
Yeah, I know. I know. I'm sorry.

39:51.347 --> 39:53.516
-I missed you guys, too.
-[Jessica's mom] So...

39:54.517 --> 39:56.894
Tell us everything. How's your writing?

39:56.977 --> 39:58.020
How's Damon?

39:58.771 --> 40:01.273
It's good. Writing's good, Damon's good.

40:01.357 --> 40:02.566
It's all good.

40:02.858 --> 40:03.734
Yeah?

40:03.818 --> 40:04.693
Yup.

Oh, Jess, it's so good to see you.

â™ª Now I'm back in a world â™ª

40:15.079 --> 40:17.873
â™ª That greets me with a smile â™ª

40:18.374 --> 40:21.752
â™ª And what makes it all worthwhile â™ª

40:21.836 --> 40:23.671

40:23.754 --> 40:25.214
-Hi.
-[Jerusa] Oh, my God!

40:26.632 --> 40:27.591
You actually came!

40:27.675 --> 40:29.385
Of course, I came.
[giggling]

40:29.468 --> 40:30.761
-Thank you.
-Oh, my goodness.

40:30.845 --> 40:33.973
Wow, this is amazing.
You're making a little human.

40:34.056 --> 40:35.307
Yeah. What are you wearing?

40:36.100 --> 40:37.643
What? This is a jumpsuit.

40:37.977 --> 40:40.896
-You look like an auto mechanic.
-It's cool though, right?

40:41.313 --> 40:42.314
Yeah.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.024
I mean, you're not gonna wear it
to the party?

40:44.984 --> 40:45.818
Nope.

40:46.068 --> 40:48.612
I'm not gonna wear it to the party.
This is just...

40:48.696 --> 40:49.905
This was for the plane.

40:50.990 --> 40:53.075
-[Duane] Hey, Jess.
-Hey, Duane.

40:53.325 --> 40:54.994
-[Jessica] What's up?
-Not too much.

40:55.077 --> 40:59.582
-[Jessica] What you got there?
-Cupcakes for the party, so...

41:00.249 --> 41:01.208
You look nice.

41:01.292 --> 41:02.626
-Thank you.
-[Duane] Yup.

41:04.253 --> 41:07.173
-Oh, my big sister's here!
-I know. Yay!

She's here.

-Yup. I'm gonna go change.
-Okay.

41:11.010 --> 41:12.052
Yeah. Thank you, Kenny.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.929
-[Kenny] You're welcome.
-All right. See you later.

So, you're leaving next month?

41:55.679 --> 41:58.432
-[Mrs. Taggart] Yeah.
-Excellent. Wait, Jessica.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.727
Jessica, you remember Mrs. Taggart,
don't you?

42:01.810 --> 42:04.897
-I do. Hi, Mrs. T.
-[Mrs. Taggart] Hi, Jess.

are going to New York next month.

42:07.816 --> 42:08.692
Cool.

42:10.236 --> 42:12.279
But we were hoping
that you could recommend a show

42:12.363 --> 42:14.073
for them to see while they're there.

42:14.323 --> 42:16.784
Yeah, definitely.
What sort of shows are you into?

42:17.952 --> 42:20.788
Um, well, we've heard
that  Jersey Boys  is good?

42:21.163 --> 42:23.916
Oh, yeah, but that's a musical.
That's not really what I'm into.

42:23.999 --> 42:25.459
What type of thing are you into?

42:25.543 --> 42:28.003
Dialogue driven dramas
that explore the human condition.

42:28.087 --> 42:28.963
Oh.

42:29.046 --> 42:31.382
Uh, is there anything like that
playing next month?

42:31.465 --> 42:34.093
The really great things are sort of few
and far between.

42:34.176 --> 42:37.596
Theater is in a really troubled state
in America right now.

42:38.138 --> 42:39.557
Most things are trash, like,

42:39.640 --> 42:42.643
you'd be surprised at who they allow
to do shows on Broadway.

42:43.352 --> 42:46.355
Or, I heard that  Cats  just opened

42:46.438 --> 42:48.691
and it's supposed to be good.

42:48.983 --> 42:51.527
Oh, I have heard good things
about that one.

42:51.610 --> 42:53.279
[chuckling]
Oh, great, thanks.

42:53.779 --> 42:55.781
[Jessica's mom]
Jessica studied theater in college.

42:55.864 --> 43:00.077
[heavy metal music playing]

43:01.287 --> 43:02.746
[all laughing]

43:05.749 --> 43:07.793
[indistinct chatter]

43:09.795 --> 43:13.966
Oh, Kimmy, these are adorable. Thank you.

43:14.550 --> 43:16.176
[Jerusa] So sweet.

43:17.636 --> 43:18.596
[Jessica] That one's mine.

43:18.679 --> 43:19.555
[chuckling]

43:19.638 --> 43:22.099
Uh-huh. From my big sister.

43:22.182 --> 43:24.184
-[all] Aw.
-Hello.

43:25.185 --> 43:26.604
-Mom, can you?
-Yeah.

43:26.687 --> 43:28.022
[Jerusa] Thank you.
[gasps]

43:31.734 --> 43:35.904
"The ABC's of Subverting
the Patriarchal Paradigm."

43:35.988 --> 43:37.615
[Jessica]
I figure since you're having a girl,

43:37.698 --> 43:39.825
although, boys can benefit
from that as well, right?

43:39.908 --> 43:41.118
[all laughing]

43:41.201 --> 43:44.038
Oh, "P is for Peaches.

43:44.121 --> 43:46.415
A singer performance artist,

43:46.498 --> 43:49.585
who challenges the traditional notions
of gender identity."

43:49.668 --> 43:51.086
[Jessica] I drew those pictures myself.

43:52.046 --> 43:53.005
[gasps]

43:53.088 --> 43:56.050
-Wow. This is amazing, Jess.
-[Jessica] Thank you.

43:56.133 --> 43:58.385
I figure it's never too soon, right?

43:58.469 --> 43:59.928
Never too soon for what?

44:01.388 --> 44:03.140
To start questioning the system.

44:03.390 --> 44:04.558
What system?

44:05.684 --> 44:08.479
The system that we're all prisoner to.

44:08.562 --> 44:10.898
[gasps]
I'm not prisoner to any system.

44:11.857 --> 44:12.733
You just...

44:13.609 --> 44:16.362
pretended to eat poop out
of a diaper, so...

44:17.112 --> 44:18.489
Let's open another present.

44:18.572 --> 44:20.199
-[Jerusa] Yes.
-[Jessica's mom] Yes.

44:20.658 --> 44:23.243
Thank you. Who belongs to this, huh?

44:24.495 --> 44:25.996
-[Jerusa] Yes.
-[mouths] I'm really sorry.

44:27.748 --> 44:30.834
[Madison on TV]  I think my whole life,
I've been in love with love.

44:31.168 --> 44:32.836
But I've never really felt love.

44:33.379 --> 44:34.630
Until now, Dustin.

44:34.713 --> 44:38.217
You complete my everything.
I love our love.

44:38.300 --> 44:39.134
I love you.

44:39.218 --> 44:40.844
[Dustin on TV]  Madison, I know.

44:40.928 --> 44:44.181
You made me see
that the one could be anyone.

44:44.264 --> 44:45.683
As long as there's love.

44:45.766 --> 44:48.435
And having you by my side
is what completes me.

44:48.519 --> 44:49.728
[Madison]  I can honestly tell you

44:49.812 --> 44:52.106
this has been the best day
of my whole life.

44:52.689 --> 44:56.360
When I look into your eyes,
I can see forever.

44:56.944 --> 44:58.821
And I never want it to end.

44:59.238 --> 45:01.323
[Dustin]  Madison, will you marry me?

45:01.407 --> 45:03.492
[Madison]  Yes, Dustin! Oh, my God!

45:04.034 --> 45:06.036
-[Madison]  Is this real?
-[Dustin]  It's so real.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.162
[Madison]  Oh, my God.

45:07.246 --> 45:09.331
I love you so much.

45:12.084 --> 45:16.839
[somber music]

45:25.222 --> 45:28.559
[upbeat music]

45:32.563 --> 45:34.106
[indistinct chatter]

45:40.946 --> 45:42.239
[Jessica] This is your idea of fun?

45:42.739 --> 45:44.616
No, this is my nightmare.

45:45.534 --> 45:47.661
I just, for some reason,
I thought you'd be better at it.

45:47.744 --> 45:49.496
I am both flattered and offended.
[Boone snickers]

45:49.580 --> 45:52.374
No, I just...
I can't believe you've never skated.

45:52.458 --> 45:54.209
I've been six feet tall
since I was 12 years old.

45:54.293 --> 45:56.503
Not once have I thought,
"Oh, let me put some wheels on this."

45:56.587 --> 45:57.421
[Boone laughs]

45:58.922 --> 46:00.716
-You're doing great.
-I'm not.

46:00.799 --> 46:02.259
You wanna try without the baby thing?

46:02.342 --> 46:04.970
I don't want to let go of this.

46:05.053 --> 46:06.555
Everybody's kind of sniggering at you.

46:06.638 --> 46:07.931
Nobody's doing that.

46:08.015 --> 46:09.224
Come on, take my hand.

46:09.892 --> 46:11.768
I'm rock solid over here.
[Jessica scoffs]

46:12.436 --> 46:14.062
You get this. This is no risk.

46:14.646 --> 46:16.607
-Okay, all right. Okay.
-Trust me.

46:17.566 --> 46:18.650
[Jessica] Hm...

46:18.734 --> 46:19.568
[both laugh]

46:19.693 --> 46:21.278
-Okay.
-Okay, that's good.

46:22.196 --> 46:24.531
-Nice, doesn't that feel good?
-It's okay, so...

46:24.615 --> 46:26.366
[both gasp]
Whoa. All right.

46:26.450 --> 46:27.618
[chuckling]
I got you.

46:28.827 --> 46:29.703
You're good.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.747
[Boone] Oh!
[both laugh]

46:31.830 --> 46:32.664
[thuds]

46:32.748 --> 46:33.874
[Boone groaning]

46:35.292 --> 46:36.210
Um...

46:38.837 --> 46:39.880
I also brought a picnic.

46:39.963 --> 46:41.173
[Jessica chuckles]
Tight.

46:44.259 --> 46:46.261
[Jessica] This is just like what you do
on a first date?

46:46.345 --> 46:47.387
[Boone laughing]

46:47.471 --> 46:48.305
[Boone] Yeah.

46:48.388 --> 46:49.932
So, tell me about your app.

46:50.015 --> 46:51.475
Oh, God.

46:51.558 --> 46:54.603
Okay, I'll tell you,
but you have to promise not to judge me.

46:54.686 --> 46:56.188
Is it Tinder for people who have herpes?

46:56.271 --> 46:57.981
[Boone laughs]
What? No.

46:58.732 --> 47:02.110
-That's not a terrible idea, by the way.
-Right? They have to, like, date somehow.

47:02.194 --> 47:04.655
No, mine is called "Hi, Mom."

47:05.531 --> 47:07.866
-Have you heard about it?
-No.

47:08.534 --> 47:10.410
Basically, we make it seem

47:10.494 --> 47:13.247
like you're staying in touch
with your parents or whoever,

47:13.330 --> 47:16.833
without you having to stay in touch
with your parents or whoever.

47:16.917 --> 47:18.126
[Jessica] That's insane.

47:18.210 --> 47:19.086
How do you do that?

47:19.169 --> 47:23.882
We study users' text feeds,
and social media.

47:23.966 --> 47:26.093
And we generate
a weekly personalized message

47:26.176 --> 47:28.929
in their own voice
from their own cellphone number.

47:29.388 --> 47:32.224
A typical one would be, "Hi, Mom.

47:32.307 --> 47:34.685
I was just thinking about you.
Thought I'd say hi.

47:34.768 --> 47:37.896
You're so right.
That cat video was cute and funny."

47:37.980 --> 47:38.814
[chuckling]

47:40.274 --> 47:42.776
That's amazing.
You're like a genius or something.

47:42.859 --> 47:44.987
-You don't think it's awful?
-No, I think it's trash.

47:45.070 --> 47:46.947
[chuckles]
[Jessica] But it's cool that you do it.

47:47.030 --> 47:47.990
-That's awesome.
-Thanks.

47:48.073 --> 47:50.867
Do you think I could get a hook up
for like my mom and my sister?

47:51.159 --> 47:52.953
-How thoughtful of you.
-Do you know a guy? Yeah.

47:53.036 --> 47:54.621
[both laughing]
Yeah, I, sort of, know a guy.

47:54.705 --> 47:55.539
[Jessica giggles]

47:55.622 --> 47:57.708
How about you?
Tell me about one of your plays.

47:59.876 --> 48:02.713
Nah, let's just change the subject.

48:03.297 --> 48:05.924
I don't...
I thought theater was all you cared about.

48:06.008 --> 48:07.759
-[Jessica] It is.
-So, what's going on?

48:08.427 --> 48:09.595
Uh...

48:10.637 --> 48:12.472
Do you remember when I mentioned
that there was like

48:12.556 --> 48:14.933
a handful of theater companies
that was interested in my work?

48:15.017 --> 48:15.934
Yeah.

48:16.810 --> 48:17.769
I lied.

48:18.979 --> 48:19.855
So...

48:21.481 --> 48:24.234
Oh, shit. I found something
that you feel insecure about.

48:24.901 --> 48:26.862
What? I'm like insecure about everything.

48:27.904 --> 48:29.906
-You hide it well.
-[Jessica] Well...

48:30.949 --> 48:32.242
I just really love theater.

48:32.326 --> 48:33.452
You know, I feel like I love it

48:33.535 --> 48:35.787
the way that most people
love like sports or food.

48:35.871 --> 48:37.372
-[Boone] Oh, I love food and sports.
-Yeah.

48:37.456 --> 48:39.166
-[Boone] You love it that much?
-Yes, I do.

48:39.249 --> 48:41.627
And I've been like that since I was a kid.

48:41.710 --> 48:43.795
I love everything about it.
I love reading it.

48:43.879 --> 48:46.465
I love watching it even when it's bad.

48:46.548 --> 48:50.761
I love teaching it.
I especially love making it.

48:51.178 --> 48:52.804
I just... I love it all.

48:53.180 --> 48:55.766
[Boone]
That's great. So, what's the problem?

48:56.099 --> 48:57.309
I don't know if it loves me back

48:57.392 --> 48:59.269
and that scares the shit out of me.

48:59.353 --> 49:01.396
[Boone]
Come on. I'm sure it loves you back.

49:01.480 --> 49:04.858
No, I have a wall full
of rejection letters that beg to differ.

49:04.941 --> 49:07.361
-I would love to read one.
-[Jessica] What? A rejection letter?

49:07.444 --> 49:09.821
No. I would love to read one
of your plays.

49:11.239 --> 49:14.785
Maybe, I'll think about it
and get back to you.

49:14.868 --> 49:17.120
You'd happily share it
with a room full of strangers,

49:17.204 --> 49:18.622
but for me, you have to think about it.

49:18.705 --> 49:22.626
Yeah, well, it's different to share it
with somebody that you know.

49:22.709 --> 49:23.877
It's like really intimate.

49:24.211 --> 49:25.754
I already know I'm gonna like it.

49:26.004 --> 49:27.422
Okay, well, don't do that.

49:27.923 --> 49:30.676
If I do show you my stuff, and that's if,

49:30.926 --> 49:33.553
you have to promise me
that you will be honest.

49:34.429 --> 49:37.599
Honesty is like all I care about.

49:37.808 --> 49:39.351
Was that supposed to be
an impression of me?

49:39.434 --> 49:40.936
[Boone]
Oh, it did sound like you, I guess.

49:41.019 --> 49:42.312
Yeah, it did, a little bit.

49:43.522 --> 49:45.524
[funky music]

49:53.615 --> 49:55.075
Well, this is me.

49:55.158 --> 49:58.286
Yeah. I know. I already, uh, spent
the night here, remember?

49:58.370 --> 49:59.663
-Yes.
-Mm-hm.

49:59.746 --> 50:01.540
-I had such a great time today.
-Me, too.

50:01.623 --> 50:03.667
It was really lovely.

50:04.084 --> 50:06.294
-You're such a beautiful skater.
-Thank you.

50:06.378 --> 50:07.963
I had a really terrible teacher.

50:08.046 --> 50:10.882
You're sure I don't still remind you
of how not Damon I am?

50:12.634 --> 50:14.136
[smooches]

50:14.928 --> 50:16.346
-No.
-Mm-hm.

50:16.680 --> 50:18.014
Are you gonna invite me up?

50:20.392 --> 50:22.394
I was thinking maybe not.

50:23.228 --> 50:26.273
Why? I already know your bathroom
is gross AF.

50:26.815 --> 50:28.692
First of all, I've cleaned it thoroughly.

50:28.775 --> 50:30.485
-Good.
-And second of all...

50:31.361 --> 50:33.113
I think we should slow it down
a little bit.

50:33.196 --> 50:35.115
I spent the night here
the first time we hung out.

50:35.198 --> 50:36.074
-Yes.
-Mm-hm.

50:36.158 --> 50:37.993
-And it was tremendous.
-Mm.

50:38.076 --> 50:39.995
You booty called me like four days later.

50:40.829 --> 50:43.165
-So, so fun.
-You're an excellent lover.

50:43.248 --> 50:44.958
Well, please don't call me lover.
[Boone laughs]

50:45.041 --> 50:45.959
It's disgusting.

50:46.042 --> 50:47.169
What's the problem?

50:48.295 --> 50:50.922
I probably seem to you,
like I have my shit together.

50:51.006 --> 50:52.549
But, um...

50:53.175 --> 50:55.218
I just got out of a marriage
eight months ago.

50:55.302 --> 50:58.680
And everything is just a bit shit.

50:58.764 --> 51:01.016
Boone, you so do not
seem like you have it together.

51:01.099 --> 51:02.350
And, I don't either.

51:02.434 --> 51:03.935
I just got out of a relationship, too.

51:04.019 --> 51:06.271
Well, all the more reason to...

51:07.522 --> 51:08.565
Say good night.

51:08.648 --> 51:10.484
Really? Boone.

51:10.567 --> 51:11.902
-Yeah.
-Boone, Boone, Boone.

51:11.985 --> 51:14.029
-I'm trying to be strong.
-I'm a unicorn.

51:14.112 --> 51:15.280
[Boone] Oh.

51:15.363 --> 51:18.325
That's got to mean something.

51:21.495 --> 51:22.829
Good night, Jessica.

51:24.039 --> 51:24.998
Good night.

51:34.925 --> 51:36.301
-[Boone] Mm.
-Mm-hm.

51:39.846 --> 51:41.306
Oh, fuck it.

51:42.182 --> 51:43.433
-Just come up.
-[Jessica] Yes.

51:43.517 --> 51:45.519
We can always say good night
in the morning, right?

51:45.602 --> 51:48.396
[relaxing music]

51:48.480 --> 51:49.564
[Boone moaning]

51:53.443 --> 51:54.986
[moaning continues]

51:59.032 --> 51:59.866
We're naked.

51:59.950 --> 52:02.118
We are so naked.
[Boone chuckles]

52:02.202 --> 52:03.286
[Jessica] Mm-hm.

52:05.622 --> 52:06.540
[Boone exhales]

52:07.249 --> 52:08.250
You're so beautiful.

52:08.834 --> 52:10.544
I am.
[both laughing]

52:11.294 --> 52:12.212
I'm a little nervous.

52:12.295 --> 52:14.548
Oh, no, no, no.
You don't seem nervous at all.

52:19.636 --> 52:23.348
-I love the way you feel.
-I like the way you feel me.

52:23.431 --> 52:24.391
-Yeah?
-Mm-hm.

52:26.434 --> 52:27.769
How about if I feel you here?

52:27.853 --> 52:31.690
[gasps]
Oh, shit, Boone. Yup.

52:33.608 --> 52:34.568
Oh.

52:34.651 --> 52:36.528
[Jessica whispering]
Where do you like to be touched?

52:36.611 --> 52:37.821
[Boone] Oh, you know.

52:38.321 --> 52:39.447
Anywhere is nice.

52:39.531 --> 52:40.740
-Yeah? Is that okay?
-Yeah, there.

52:40.824 --> 52:43.243
There is the best.

52:45.453 --> 52:47.038
[Boone pants]

52:47.122 --> 52:48.290
[Jessica moans]

52:56.631 --> 52:57.549
[Jessica] Yeah.

52:57.757 --> 53:00.552
[upbeat music]

53:03.346 --> 53:04.723
[Damon humming]

53:06.016 --> 53:07.017
-Hey.
-Hey.

53:07.642 --> 53:09.227
-[Jessica] You got a dog?
-I did.

53:09.311 --> 53:12.063
[Jessica] Wow, it's a really cute dog.
She's so little.

53:12.147 --> 53:13.607
Are you just walking around here?

53:14.441 --> 53:15.442
Uh, yeah.

53:15.525 --> 53:17.402
Hm? You're just walking around
the neighborhood?

53:17.485 --> 53:18.737
-You don't live around here.
-What?

53:18.820 --> 53:19.988
Why are you walking around here?

53:20.071 --> 53:22.282
-Well, honestly I've been thinking.
-Oh, you've been thinking?

53:22.365 --> 53:23.658
-You've been thinking?
-Yeah, I've...

53:23.742 --> 53:26.077
-Why do you keep doing that?
-Because you don't live around here.

53:26.161 --> 53:27.829
You're walking her over here.
That's weird.

53:27.913 --> 53:30.206
Excuse me, sir.
Is this woman bothering you?

53:30.290 --> 53:32.459
No, no. She's not bothering me, man.
It's fine.

53:32.542 --> 53:34.544
-Would you like me to call the police?
-No, man. No.

53:34.628 --> 53:35.587
I'm gonna call the police.

53:35.670 --> 53:37.797
Don't call the police, man.
I love her, okay?

53:38.381 --> 53:39.341
I love her!

53:40.258 --> 53:41.092
Good luck.

53:41.176 --> 53:42.385
I love you.

53:42.969 --> 53:45.972
Hey, listen, I know you think
you're the one with the broken heart.

53:46.056 --> 53:48.767
But, remember, you broke up with me.

53:50.685 --> 53:52.520
You didn't have to accept it so easily.

53:54.105 --> 53:55.440
Well, what was I supposed to do?

53:55.857 --> 53:58.026
-I don't know, fight for us.
-Fight for what?

53:58.109 --> 53:59.778
We were already in a relationship.

53:59.861 --> 54:01.237
I was scared shit.

54:01.321 --> 54:02.364
Scared of what?

54:02.781 --> 54:05.867
Of everything.
Of being defined as your girlfriend,

54:05.951 --> 54:08.703
of not being a writer,
of trying and failing,

54:08.787 --> 54:12.791
of losing myself in this relationship.

54:12.874 --> 54:16.252
Listen, Jess, I just think
that we deserve another chance.

54:16.336 --> 54:18.338
All right? I deserve another chance.

54:19.589 --> 54:21.257
I'm kind of seeing somebody right now.

54:21.341 --> 54:24.052
Well, would you want me to fight him?
Because I'll punch him right...

54:24.135 --> 54:26.221
No, Damon. Go home, okay?

54:26.304 --> 54:28.598
Don't walk your freaking cute ass dog
in my neighborhood anymore.

54:28.682 --> 54:30.767
-[Damon] Jess, come on.
-Go! Seriously.

54:31.267 --> 54:32.268
Jess.

54:33.687 --> 54:34.521
Jess.

54:36.231 --> 54:38.733
-Jess...
-[Boone]  Jess. Jess.

54:38.817 --> 54:39.734
Jess.

54:41.152 --> 54:42.028
You all right?

54:42.821 --> 54:44.739
I'm okay, just thinking.

54:46.700 --> 54:48.660
I was gonna make some coffee.
You want some coffee?

54:50.036 --> 54:52.622
-Oh, I am more of a tea person.
-Ah.

54:53.373 --> 54:54.833
So...

54:54.916 --> 54:56.584
Then, I shall bring you tea.
[Jessica giggles]

54:56.668 --> 54:57.627
Thank you.

55:11.057 --> 55:16.479
[somber music]

55:31.745 --> 55:32.579
[Jessica]  All right.

55:33.997 --> 55:36.499
Close your eyes and open your minds.

55:37.709 --> 55:38.877
We're gonna play another game.

55:38.960 --> 55:41.838
Except this game is not going to be
as easy as the others.

55:41.921 --> 55:42.881
Why not?

55:43.548 --> 55:44.382
You'll see.

55:45.300 --> 55:46.176
You ready?

55:49.304 --> 55:50.388
[inhales]

55:50.472 --> 55:51.723
It's your birthday,

55:51.806 --> 55:53.725
and you're in the car with your parents.

55:55.060 --> 55:56.895
[Davion]  My parents don't have a car.

55:56.978 --> 55:58.313
[Jessica]  Then use your imagination.

55:58.396 --> 56:00.565
Okay, I'm gonna imagine I'm in a Ferrari.

56:00.940 --> 56:02.734
Okay, great.

56:03.610 --> 56:06.112
[Jessica]  The whole year, you've been
telling anybody who would listen

56:06.196 --> 56:08.239
that all you wanted
for your birthday was a dog.

56:08.323 --> 56:10.408
And you think that you're on your way
to the pet store

56:10.492 --> 56:12.118
to pick one out right now.

56:12.202 --> 56:14.496
But what you don't know
is that your mom just found out

56:14.579 --> 56:16.206
that she's going to have another baby.

56:16.289 --> 56:18.708
And your parents have already
been stretching their money

56:18.792 --> 56:21.669
to make sure that they can pay
for your college education.

56:22.128 --> 56:24.255
You don't know any of this yet
because you're just a kid

56:24.339 --> 56:26.883
and they work really hard
to shield you from that stuff.

56:27.717 --> 56:31.638
But, unfortunately, this creates
a lot of tension between them.

56:32.138 --> 56:34.724
Sometimes, you hear them yelling
at each other late at night

56:34.808 --> 56:35.975
when they think you're asleep.

56:36.059 --> 56:38.394
And it really scares you.

56:40.188 --> 56:44.150
Now your dad, being the proud
and impractical man that he is,

56:44.234 --> 56:46.111
really wants to get you this dog

56:46.194 --> 56:48.071
even though he knows
that you can't afford it.

56:48.988 --> 56:52.242
And your mom is frustrated at him for this
because she works, too.

56:52.325 --> 56:54.244
And she knows that she's going
to have to quit her job

56:54.327 --> 56:55.745
to take care of this new baby.

56:55.995 --> 56:58.248
Wow. I didn't know things were so tight.

56:58.331 --> 57:00.834
My parents should probably sell
this Ferrari.

57:00.917 --> 57:01.793
Davion.

57:02.418 --> 57:03.837
Cool it with the Ferrari, okay?

57:05.255 --> 57:06.089
[Jessica] Now.

57:06.631 --> 57:07.757
Imagine that you're the dad.

57:08.341 --> 57:11.052
You're driving the car
and you look in the rear-view mirror,

57:11.136 --> 57:14.347
and you see your kid
with this big dopey smile on her face.

57:14.430 --> 57:16.349
I don't have a dopey smile.

57:16.433 --> 57:18.059
You're right, you have a beautiful smile.

57:18.601 --> 57:19.561
Thank you.

57:20.270 --> 57:22.272
Now, imagine that you're the mom.

57:22.355 --> 57:23.857
You're in the passenger seat...

57:24.357 --> 57:26.860
and you see a look of anguish
go across your husband's face

57:26.943 --> 57:28.111
as you pass the pet store.

57:28.194 --> 57:31.281
What? We're passing the pet store?
Where are we going?

57:31.364 --> 57:33.074
That's a good question.
Where are we going?

57:33.533 --> 57:35.243
I don't know. This is your game.

57:35.326 --> 57:37.620
Yeah, but it's up to you
to decide where we go next.

57:43.042 --> 57:44.002
[Shandra] Uh, hey.

57:44.085 --> 57:46.045
-Ms. James?
-Oh, hey.

57:46.171 --> 57:47.839
What are you doing over here?
Where's your mom?

57:47.922 --> 57:49.799
Oh, she's waiting for me
around the corner.

57:51.217 --> 57:52.469
Is everything okay?

57:52.969 --> 57:55.180
Well, my dad got your message.

57:55.263 --> 57:57.140
Can you just tell him
I'm sorry about that?

57:57.223 --> 58:01.936
He told me to tell you that he's glad
that you haven't been broken by life yet.

58:02.020 --> 58:04.772
And, uh, I can go to the writer's weekend.

58:05.273 --> 58:06.900
-What, are you serious?
-[Shandra] Yeah.

58:06.983 --> 58:08.193
Yes! Yes, yes.

58:08.568 --> 58:09.986
[Jessica] Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

58:10.069 --> 58:12.572
This is amazing.
This is the best news I've heard in weeks.

58:12.655 --> 58:14.032
I'm so excited.

58:14.115 --> 58:17.035
-This is gonna be great.
-Huh. Yeah, yeah, great.

58:17.869 --> 58:19.329
What's wrong?
[Shandra sighs]

58:19.412 --> 58:22.207
My dad's still taking my brother
to Six Flags.

58:22.290 --> 58:23.124
[Jessica] So?

58:23.875 --> 58:27.003
So? Six Flags seems pretty awesome.

58:28.296 --> 58:29.464
Are you kidding me?

58:30.256 --> 58:32.425
I thought you were serious
about this program?

58:33.343 --> 58:34.385
I am.

58:34.844 --> 58:37.847
Obviously not, if you're gonna ditch,
so that you can go ride roller coasters.

58:37.931 --> 58:39.891
I don't know.
I haven't made up my mind yet.

58:39.974 --> 58:42.143
You know what? Forget it.
Just do whatever you want, Shandra.

58:42.227 --> 58:43.394
Why should I care if you don't?

58:43.478 --> 58:45.146
I didn't say I didn't care.

58:45.230 --> 58:47.232
Obviously, you don't. I have to go.

58:48.525 --> 58:49.359
[Shandra] Wait.

58:50.276 --> 58:51.569
Are you mad at me?

58:51.986 --> 58:54.948
I'm not mad at you.
I'm just really disappointed.

58:57.450 --> 58:59.327
Look, you have to go
to this writer's weekend, okay?

58:59.410 --> 59:00.954
Otherwise,
I'll be super hurt if you don't.

59:01.037 --> 59:02.288
That's not fair!

59:02.372 --> 59:04.791
Wake up, Shandra.
Since when is life supposed to be fair?

59:04.874 --> 59:07.001
You know what? Whatever.

59:07.293 --> 59:09.587
I'll send you a postcard from Six Flags.

59:29.566 --> 59:30.483
[doorbell buzzes]

59:31.442 --> 59:32.485
[Boone]  Coming.

59:36.906 --> 59:37.824
Hey.

59:38.283 --> 59:39.284
Booty call.

59:40.076 --> 59:41.202
What are you doing here?

59:41.286 --> 59:43.621
Oh, uh, sorry I didn't let you know
I was coming.

59:43.705 --> 59:47.417
It's just my phone died earlier,
and I kind of had a shitty day, so...

59:47.500 --> 59:48.626
Oh, I'm sorry.

59:49.252 --> 59:50.253
Are you okay?

59:50.837 --> 59:53.172
Yeah. Uh, I wish... I wish you called.

59:54.924 --> 59:57.218
Do you want to go for a walk or something?

59:57.302 --> 59:58.219
I...

59:58.303 --> 01:00:00.680
-I got pickles in here.
-Um...

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:02.473
-Hey, I'm gonna get out of here.
-Oh, fuck.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:04.601
Just hold on a minute.

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:05.602
Hi.

01:00:06.894 --> 01:00:08.104
You must be Mandy Moore.

01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:10.189
I'm Jessica James.
It's really nice to meet you.

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:12.233
I love your work.
I love the way you shoot carrots.

01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:13.359
-Thank you.
-Jess.

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:14.444
[sighs]

01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:17.196
You suck balls.

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:20.992
I got to go.

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:23.995
[Boone] Jess, hold on.

01:00:24.078 --> 01:00:25.204
-Jess.
-What?

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.372
-Wait.
-No.

01:00:27.206 --> 01:00:28.374
Jess, come on!

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.418
She was just delivering
a  Windsurfing Magazine

01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:32.462
that keeps getting sent
to her place by accident.

01:00:32.545 --> 01:00:34.714
Then, you know, we got talking.

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:36.591
You weren't just talking.
Don't bullshit me.

01:00:36.674 --> 01:00:37.884
-[Boone] Yes.
-Where's your shirt?

01:00:38.217 --> 01:00:40.345
Okay, yeah. I'm sorry.

01:00:40.845 --> 01:00:42.764
But you, more than anyone,
must realize what it's like

01:00:42.847 --> 01:00:43.973
to have a history with someone.

01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:46.017
Those feelings don't just evaporate.

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:47.810
Yeah, no. I understand.

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:51.022
Nothing works out, people let you down,
and you should never trust anybody ever.

01:00:51.105 --> 01:00:52.357
I've known that since I was a kid.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.275
We were fucking married, Jess.

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:57.820
Our families watched us say,
"Till death do you part" together.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:00:58.821
I mean, it's...

01:00:59.572 --> 01:01:02.659
It's a little bigger than just saying,
"Oh, maybe I'm in love with this guy."

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:04.535
Oh, my gosh. Wow, I'm sorry.

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:06.746
I didn't realize that my feelings
weren't as valid as yours.

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:08.706
-That's not what I meant. I'm sorry.
-[Jessica] Okay.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:11.000
-That...
-Wait a second. You windsurf?

01:01:11.376 --> 01:01:13.753
-Yeah. I windsurf.
-Come on, man.

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:16.714
-I like the sensation of being at sea.
-[Jessica] Mm.

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:18.299
You would like it. You should come.

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:20.551
No, I'm good. And you know what?

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:21.469
What?

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:26.265
-Mature.
-Yeah.

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.225
Jessica.

01:01:28.726 --> 01:01:29.644
What?

01:01:29.727 --> 01:01:30.978
I really like you.

01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:34.691
Yeah, Boone. Of course, you do.

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:37.068
Everybody does. I'm freaking dope.

01:01:43.157 --> 01:01:43.991
[mouths]
Fuck.

01:01:46.452 --> 01:01:51.207
[somber music]

01:01:58.923 --> 01:02:01.175
-You got everyone?
-Almost.

01:02:01.759 --> 01:02:02.885
Should we wait?

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.516
No, we can go.

01:02:10.768 --> 01:02:11.978
[car engine starting]

01:02:15.314 --> 01:02:17.024
[children squealing]

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:21.738
[delightful scream]

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:23.990
Got you.

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:33.291
[relaxing music]

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:57.815
[child #1]  The Notebook.
[children giggling]

01:02:57.899 --> 01:02:59.984
[child #2]
No, or like,  The Cat and The Dog.

01:03:00.067 --> 01:03:03.321
Romeo and Juliet, you know
how, like, they're in different worlds.

01:03:03.404 --> 01:03:05.072
And, like, they're not allowed
to be together.

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:06.532
It's cat and dog...

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:09.452
I'm gonna write another story
about a mega-ultron cookie bird.

01:03:09.535 --> 01:03:10.536
[all laughing]

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.330
[child #3] D plus C...

01:03:12.413 --> 01:03:14.373
-Equals...
-[Davion] Equals five.

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:15.750
How do you spell five?

01:03:15.833 --> 01:03:17.335
[all laughing]

01:03:17.418 --> 01:03:19.837
It's supposed to be, apparently,
like a spiritual journey.

01:03:35.353 --> 01:03:36.562
-[Jessica] Excuse me?
-[Sarah] Hi.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.648
-Hey, you're Sarah Jones, right?
-Yes.

01:03:38.731 --> 01:03:41.150
Oh, I don't know why I asked that.
I knew it was you.

01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:42.443
[Jessica] Just...

01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:45.112
I really think about you a lot.
I really do.

01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:47.949
You are fierce and passionate,
and unapologetic.

01:03:48.032 --> 01:03:49.617
And I love the way
you write your characters,

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.661
and I love the way you write women. Um...

01:03:51.744 --> 01:03:54.622
And I just...
I'm so thankful that you're here.

01:03:54.705 --> 01:03:56.499
And the kids are really thankful
that you're here.

01:03:56.582 --> 01:03:59.043
I mean, not as thankful as I am
just because I, like, love you.

01:03:59.126 --> 01:04:00.962
I really do. I... And I...

01:04:01.045 --> 01:04:03.214
You're like six feet almost. I'm six feet.

01:04:03.297 --> 01:04:04.757
Uh, what is your name?

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:07.218
Oh, it's Jessica. It's Jessica James.

01:04:07.301 --> 01:04:08.553
That was really weird of me to do.

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:10.304
-And I'm sorry. I'm blabbing.
-No, don't worry.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:13.724
-Um, can I ask you something?
-[Sarah] Yeah, sure.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:18.062
When did you know
that you were gonna make it?

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.481
[Sarah] That's a big question. Uh...

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:23.276
I guess I would say
I'll let you know when I get the memo.

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.987
What do you mean when you get the memo?
You literally won a Tony.

01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:27.822
Yes, but, you know...

01:04:27.905 --> 01:04:29.657
That and a MetroCard gets me on a subway.

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:30.700
You still take the subway?

01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:32.869
Yeah, girl. How much do you think
playwrights make?

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:34.662
So, you're just saying
that no matter what I do,

01:04:34.745 --> 01:04:36.831
there's still no assurance
that I'm actually gonna make it

01:04:36.914 --> 01:04:39.333
even if I win the best award
that playwriting has to offer?

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:44.088
Yeah, it's really more about like,
what does theater actually mean to you?

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.678
-I just love it.
-[Sarah] And you're doing it.

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:53.014
Like, that's why we're here. Right?

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:54.223
This is it.

01:04:55.474 --> 01:04:57.310
There's kind of not more to it than that.

01:05:06.819 --> 01:05:11.407
[somber music]

01:05:14.285 --> 01:05:15.453
[waves rustle]

01:05:19.957 --> 01:05:20.791
[latch clicks]

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:24.253
Yeah?

01:05:24.879 --> 01:05:25.963
Is Shandra home?

01:05:26.672 --> 01:05:27.506
Yeah.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:30.551
Can I speak to her?

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:35.389
I watched those  TED Talks .

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:36.432
And?

01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:38.601
You were right, she's cool.

01:05:40.728 --> 01:05:41.771
No shoes in the house.

01:05:41.854 --> 01:05:42.730
Yes, ma'am.

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:56.160
[sighs]
[Jessica] Knock, knock.

01:05:59.038 --> 01:05:59.872
Hi.

01:06:00.414 --> 01:06:01.916
What are you doing here?

01:06:03.417 --> 01:06:04.752
I'm here to apologize.

01:06:05.419 --> 01:06:06.420
About what?

01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:08.506
I'm really, really sorry
for making you feel bad

01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:10.424
about wanting to spend time with your dad.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.263
Do you mind if I sit down?

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:25.272
Well, this is a really cool room.

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:28.776
Thanks.

01:06:30.569 --> 01:06:32.154
I thought about you a lot this weekend.

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:37.159
I thought of how it must be hard
to be 11 years old

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:40.204
and have your parents negotiating
through lawyers to spend time with you.

01:06:40.287 --> 01:06:41.831
-And my brother.
-[Jessica] Yeah.

01:06:41.914 --> 01:06:42.748
And your brother,

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:44.834
and I get how
that can make you feel invisible.

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:47.128
[Jessica]
You feel like you're forgotten, and...

01:06:51.924 --> 01:06:54.010
You know, I went through the same thing
when I was a kid.

01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:55.886
-You did?
-Yeah, I did.

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:58.180
Except my parents never got it together.

01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:00.224
Eventually, they just asked me
and my sister to choose

01:07:00.307 --> 01:07:02.101
who we wanted to spend more time with.

01:07:03.144 --> 01:07:04.979
Hm. Who did you pick?

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:07.481
My mom.

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.900
But it wasn't because I loved her more.

01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:12.278
You know, I really loved both
of my parents.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:15.322
I just thought that my mom
would have harder time without us.

01:07:16.323 --> 01:07:17.950
And that really broke my dad's heart.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:20.703
And he hasn't forgiven me for that.

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:24.915
But you never got that dog either,
did you?

01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:27.251
No.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:31.672
That's sad.

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.425
I brought you back something.

01:07:40.639 --> 01:07:41.599
Wow.

01:07:42.099 --> 01:07:44.101
It's really pretty. Thanks.

01:07:44.185 --> 01:07:47.730
I would really, really, really like
to help you work on your play.

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:51.984
Well, yeah. Sure.

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:54.445
Cool. Because your mom already told me
I could stay for dinner.

01:07:54.528 --> 01:07:57.990
And so far, it smells dope!

01:07:59.116 --> 01:08:01.118
[upbeat music]

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.390
[upbeat music continues]

01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:26.310
[beeps]

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:37.947
Hey.

01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:39.782
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:08:40.866 --> 01:08:42.158
[both laughing]

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:45.203
-Thank you for coming.
-Of course. I was so pleased you called.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.705
I brought you some tea.

01:08:46.788 --> 01:08:49.332
Oh, thank you. You remembered.

01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:50.751
That's very nice.

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:55.965
[heavy sigh]

01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:58.216
Look, I am really sorry.

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:01.136
What are you talking about? It...

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.763
You don't need to apologize for anything.

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:05.390
No, you told me early on
you were still trying to figure stuff out

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:07.100
and I guess I just didn't listen, and...

01:09:07.184 --> 01:09:08.018
Ah.

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:12.982
You know, for what it's worth,
I, uh, I called,

01:09:13.064 --> 01:09:15.901
and got my  Windsurfing Magazine
redirected to my place.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:16.819
[Jessica] Oh, good.

01:09:16.902 --> 01:09:17.819
-So...
-[Jessica] Yeah.

01:09:18.362 --> 01:09:19.863
But what about those feelings?

01:09:20.738 --> 01:09:23.242
Oh, also redirected.

01:09:23.367 --> 01:09:26.120
-Are you sure?
-[Boone] Oh, yes, I am.

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:27.787
How do you know?

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:29.290
Well, for one,

01:09:29.372 --> 01:09:31.750
you know how I used to obsess
about everything she did online?

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:32.667
[Jessica] I do.

01:09:32.751 --> 01:09:36.005
Now, the only page I refresh is yours.

01:09:36.921 --> 01:09:37.881
[clicks tongue]
Come on.

01:09:37.965 --> 01:09:40.301
Oh, that sounded better in my head.

01:09:41.468 --> 01:09:42.636
[Jessica] I, um...

01:09:44.095 --> 01:09:46.182
-Try this.
-[Boone] What is this?

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.725
That is every single play
that I've ever written.

01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:50.060
Ever.

01:09:50.144 --> 01:09:51.604
-Holy shit, it's heavy.
-I know.

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:54.523
I got a lot of thoughts and feelings,
and I have for a really long time.

01:09:55.232 --> 01:09:56.567
I can't wait to read it.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:03.782
Take your time.

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:05.659
And, uh...

01:10:06.076 --> 01:10:08.078
You know, no need to rush.

01:10:08.162 --> 01:10:10.372
-I'm gonna start.
-Okay, wait, wait. Slow down.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:12.041
Okay, I'm gonna go, and...

01:10:12.124 --> 01:10:13.417
thank you for the tea.

01:10:18.088 --> 01:10:24.303
[upbeat music]

01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:37.775
[somber music]

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:43.739
[upbeat music]

01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:56.418
Here you go, thank you.

01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:01.006
[Jessica clears throat]

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:06.804
-[Tasha] Oh! Why, hello there, sunshine.
-What's up, hoochie?

01:11:06.887 --> 01:11:08.806
What are you doing here? What's going on?

01:11:08.889 --> 01:11:11.308
Nothing. I'm just going to London.

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:13.352
Okay, what for?

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.854
I've been invited
by the Donmar Warehouse Theater

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:17.481
to teach
at a children's playmaking workshop

01:11:17.564 --> 01:11:20.317
and direct a stage reading
of one of my plays.

01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:21.610
[screams]
Oh, my God!

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:22.569
Oh, my God!

01:11:22.653 --> 01:11:23.612
[Tasha screaming]

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:25.489
Oh, congratulations!

01:11:25.572 --> 01:11:26.407
[Tasha laughing]

01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:28.075
-Thank you.
-[Tasha] Oh!

01:11:28.158 --> 01:11:30.202
Uh, anyway, I got you something.

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:32.413
Wait, are you kidding me? For me?

01:11:32.496 --> 01:11:34.331
-I should be getting you a present.
-No, but...

01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:37.376
You know how I pretty much moved here
to escape my family?

01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:39.253
Yes, you and everybody else
who moved here.

01:11:39.336 --> 01:11:41.213
Well, I got more than I bargained for.

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:42.339
I love you.

01:11:42.423 --> 01:11:44.591
And you're the first person
I wanted to tell

01:11:44.675 --> 01:11:45.926
as soon as I find out the news.

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:46.927
Aw.

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:51.640
[paper rustling]

01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:57.229
Oh, my God. It's an Ola.

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:58.397
[Tasha] It's beautiful.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.190
It captures and replays
your vibration patterns.

01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:01.942
I can't believe it.
Oh, my God. I'm gonna cry.

01:12:02.026 --> 01:12:02.901
Please don't cry.

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:05.779
You know I hate to show emotion
in public spaces.

01:12:05.863 --> 01:12:08.240
Oh, Jessica.
[sobs]

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.158
Ew.

01:12:09.616 --> 01:12:11.368
-[Tasha] Thank you.
-Of course.

01:12:11.452 --> 01:12:13.078
Okay, everybody, listen up!

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:17.082
Free coffee all around,
in honor of the incredible Jessica James,

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:21.545
whose amazing work is going to be read
by the Donmar Warehouse Theater

01:12:21.628 --> 01:12:23.255
-in London.
-Yes.

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:24.214
[applause]

01:12:24.298 --> 01:12:25.174
â™ª Bangers and mash â™ª

01:12:25.257 --> 01:12:26.383
â™ª Gonna get bangers and mash â™ª

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:28.510
- â™ª Yes, gonna get bangers and mash â™ª
- â™ª Bangers and mash â™ª

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:30.971
- â™ª Yes, gonna get bangers and mash â™ª
- â™ª Bangers and mash and this â™ª

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:31.930
Wait a minute.

01:12:32.639 --> 01:12:35.142
Are you telling me
that you're a mermaid, too?

01:12:35.225 --> 01:12:36.101
No.

01:12:36.935 --> 01:12:38.020
Not a mermaid.

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:41.565
I'm a merman!

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:43.192
[actress] Oh.

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:44.902
Cool.

01:12:45.819 --> 01:12:49.865
[applause]

01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:08.467
Hello.

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:12.096
My name is Banana McClain,
and today is my birthday.

01:13:12.179 --> 01:13:14.598
I told my parents
that I wanted a puppy for my birthday,

01:13:14.681 --> 01:13:16.809
but I'd also be happy with a turtle.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:18.977
We're on our way to the pet store now.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.605
I hope they don't try
and get me a goldfish.

01:13:21.688 --> 01:13:23.816
[scoffs]
[Tasha] Goldfish are no fun.

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:26.360
You can't pet or hug a goldfish.

01:13:26.443 --> 01:13:27.277
[audience laughs]

01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:29.613
[Tasha] I'm not sure
if you can pet or hold a turtle,

01:13:29.696 --> 01:13:31.657
but at least turtles have personalities.

01:13:32.032 --> 01:13:34.410
I think it's important for a pet
to have a personality.

01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:37.037
Which is why I want a puppy.

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:40.374
They seem like they would be nice,
and loyal, and fun.

01:13:41.291 --> 01:13:43.627
Of course, I guess there was a chance
I won't get a pet at all.

01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:45.421
And you know what? That's okay, too.

01:13:45.504 --> 01:13:47.464
Because birthdays aren't
about getting things.

01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:50.884
They're about celebrating what you have,
and what I have is pretty great.

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:52.219
Because it's a beautiful day

01:13:52.302 --> 01:13:54.430
and I'm with the two people
I love the most.

01:13:54.721 --> 01:13:57.349
And later, we're having cake.
And I love cake.

01:13:57.433 --> 01:14:00.102
[audience applauding]

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:14.241
[upbeat music]

01:14:14.575 --> 01:14:16.994
[mouths]
You're okay. You're okay.

01:14:24.084 --> 01:14:25.461
[Jessica]
Thank you so much for coming.

01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:27.004
Hey, so good.

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:30.424
You guys were so good.
You were great. You were so good.

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:32.718
Of course. Hi.

01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:35.053
-Hey, Jessica.
-Hey.

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:36.138
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:14:36.221 --> 01:14:37.723
[Tasha laughing]

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:39.099
You freaking killed it.

01:14:39.183 --> 01:14:40.309
-You really think so?
-Yeah.

01:14:40.392 --> 01:14:41.518
I wasn't too over the top?

01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:42.561
No, you were perfect.

01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:43.479
[sighs]
Thank you.

01:14:43.562 --> 01:14:45.022
I thought it was such a great character.

01:14:45.105 --> 01:14:46.773
Thank you so much for casting me.

01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:49.067
No, you... You were amazing.

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:52.988
[Jessica] You're so good.

01:14:53.071 --> 01:14:54.031
Uh-oh.

01:14:54.114 --> 01:14:56.450
-What?
-Don't look behind you. Don't, don't.

01:14:56.533 --> 01:14:58.202
-[Jessica] What do you mean?
-Just keep cool.

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:01.246
-[Jessica] Hi.
-Hi.

01:15:03.624 --> 01:15:04.625
You've got this.

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:11.924
-[Jessica] Hey.
-Hey.

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:13.717
I didn't know you were coming tonight.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.637
Yeah, well, you know,
I know how much this means to you.

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.097
That's...

01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:22.809
How are you?

01:15:22.893 --> 01:15:23.852
-[Damon] Good.
-Good?

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:25.854
I'm good, yeah. You?

01:15:28.398 --> 01:15:29.900
-Good.
-[Damon] Good.

01:15:34.404 --> 01:15:36.031
[exhales]
It's nice to see you.

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:38.075
-Yeah?
-[Jessica] Mm-hm.

01:15:38.158 --> 01:15:40.202
Well, it's nice to see you, too.
[Jessica chuckles]

01:15:54.883 --> 01:15:56.093
We should get tea sometime.

01:15:56.176 --> 01:15:58.303
Tea sounds great to me.

01:16:00.097 --> 01:16:01.640
You're a really good guy, Damon.

01:16:03.767 --> 01:16:04.935
I know?

01:16:05.018 --> 01:16:05.936
[chuckles]

01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:10.983
I'm sorry.

01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:13.777
No, it's okay.

01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:15.904
I'm all right.

01:16:19.199 --> 01:16:20.242
I'll call you.

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:22.786
I'll answer. Good to see you.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:24.454
[chuckles]

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:25.789
-[Damon] See you.
-See you.

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:50.439
It seemed like a positive interaction.

01:16:50.981 --> 01:16:52.232
Did you know he was gonna be here?

01:16:52.316 --> 01:16:54.693
-I had no idea. It was a surprise.
-[Boone] I'm sorry.

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:57.446
I could have warned you.
He posted it on Twitter three days ago.

01:16:57.529 --> 01:16:59.948
You could probably stop following him
on social media, by the way.

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:01.074
-Yeah?
-[Jessica] Yeah.

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:02.451
Are you sure you're ready for that?

01:17:03.535 --> 01:17:04.578
I guess so.

01:17:05.412 --> 01:17:08.415
Well, I guess, you should probably
stop following my ex as well, then.

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:10.167
I don't know if I can.

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:13.086
-[Boone] The food photos?
-She really knows how to handle a banana.

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:15.839
Hey, I, uh, I read your plays.

01:17:15.922 --> 01:17:18.091
-All of them already?
-[Boone] Every page.

01:17:18.425 --> 01:17:19.259
And?

01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:23.221
You're a very complicated person.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:25.098
I know. I'm sorry.

01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:26.141
No, don't...

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:29.019
You never need to apologize for that.

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:33.899
There are so many other things
you can apologize for.

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:34.816
[giggles]

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.027
Oh, my gosh. I forgot to tell you.

01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:38.528
-I am going to London.
-What?

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:41.490
The Donmar Theater wants to do
a stage reading of one of my plays.

01:17:41.573 --> 01:17:43.241
[Boone] That sounds prestigious.

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:46.244
Yeah, I know.
It's like kind of a big deal.

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:47.496
[Boone] Nice!
[taps]

01:17:47.579 --> 01:17:48.872
Good job.
[Jessica snickers]

01:17:48.955 --> 01:17:50.999
-Have you ever been to London?
-No, I haven't. How is it?

01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:53.335
[Boone] Oh, it's the best.
You're gonna have such a great time.

01:17:54.378 --> 01:17:55.337
You know, I, um...

01:17:56.254 --> 01:17:58.840
I have a ton of frequent flier miles.

01:17:59.883 --> 01:18:02.010
You know, just if you wanted
to bring someone with you

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:04.554
to show you around the town.

01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:05.681
How does it work?

01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:07.933
-How does what work?
-[Jessica] Frequent flier miles.

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.519
[dings]

01:18:12.646 --> 01:18:15.524
Dude, I can't believe your boyfriend
bought us tickets to London.

01:18:15.607 --> 01:18:17.901
Okay, who said anything about him
being my boyfriend?

01:18:17.984 --> 01:18:19.194
Wait. What are you talking about?

01:18:19.277 --> 01:18:22.072
This is like the most romantic gesture
I have ever seen.

01:18:22.155 --> 01:18:23.407
Yeah, it's dope.

01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:26.284
But it takes more than a couple
of roundtrip tickets to London

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:27.744
for somebody to be my boyf.

01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:29.705
That is so boss.

01:18:29.788 --> 01:18:32.666
-[Shandra] What is so boss?
-Uh, Jessica.

01:18:32.749 --> 01:18:34.751
Oh, yeah, duh.
[dings]

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:37.087
[woman on P.A.]  Flight attendants,
please fasten your seat belts

01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:38.505
and prepare for takeoff.

01:18:39.423 --> 01:18:42.342
It was really cool of your parents
to let you come with us to the workshop.

01:18:42.426 --> 01:18:45.470
Well, it was really cool of your boyfriend
to get me a ticket, too.

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:47.389
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Sister.

01:18:47.472 --> 01:18:50.016
Just because a guy buys a lady
a couple of roundtrip tickets to London

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:51.810
does not make him her boyfriend.

01:18:52.644 --> 01:18:54.062
Did you know that I introduced them?

01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:55.105
[chuckles]

01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:59.359
You know, I like your jumpsuit.

01:19:00.026 --> 01:19:00.944
Thank you.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.030
Yeah, it's pretty badass, right?

01:19:04.114 --> 01:19:06.825
Hm. Yeah, it is.

01:19:11.288 --> 01:19:16.293
[relaxing music]

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:20.046
[plane engine whirs]

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:30.265
[upbeat music]
