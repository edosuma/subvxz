WEBVTT

00:01.438 --> 00:03.606
All occupants take cover!

00:03.607 --> 00:05.174
This not drill.

00:05.175 --> 00:08.410
Knowhere is alive.

00:10.013 --> 00:13.148
Okay, I really,
really hate that sound.

00:13.149 --> 00:16.318
And is it just me, or
did Astro Pooch just talk?

00:16.318 --> 00:17.786
Cosmo
speak telepathically,

00:17.787 --> 00:20.789
Peter Quill, also called
Star-Lord.

00:20.790 --> 00:23.092
It's nice to see
fellow Earthling.

00:23.093 --> 00:24.527
He's not exactly...

00:24.528 --> 00:26.729
Da, Quill just learn
he is half-Spartax.

00:26.730 --> 00:28.130
Cosmo read mind.

00:28.131 --> 00:30.499
Hey! That's personal info.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.390
And I'm not exactly sure
how I feel about it yet.

00:33.391 --> 00:34.930
Then not to worry.

00:34.931 --> 00:37.195
Some of Cosmo's
best friends mixed breed.

00:39.042 --> 00:41.377
I've been waiting
a long time for this,

00:41.378 --> 00:42.778
brother.

00:46.082 --> 00:49.084
Nobody gets snuffed
what still owes me money.

00:49.519 --> 00:51.186
That's bad for business.

00:51.187 --> 00:52.788
I owe you nothing, Ravager.

00:56.326 --> 00:58.427
I delivered the box
and Quill.

00:58.428 --> 01:00.796
Ain't my fault you
couldn't hold onto 'em.

01:04.634 --> 01:06.569
So what's that
thing worth, anyway?

01:06.570 --> 01:08.137
Seriously, Yondu?

01:08.138 --> 01:10.439
What? Just 'cause
I sold you out

01:10.440 --> 01:13.075
don't mean I ain't entitled
to my share of your profit.

01:23.853 --> 01:26.088
Cosmo probe
Knowhere mind,

01:26.089 --> 01:27.656
but no one home.

01:27.657 --> 01:29.291
So what's making
a giant, dormant

01:29.292 --> 01:32.161
Celestial head
come to life, Broker?

01:32.162 --> 01:34.496
Clearly, the energy
from the Cosmic Seed

01:34.497 --> 01:36.432
inside your CryptoCube
is leaking out

01:36.433 --> 01:39.268
and triggering
a massive bio-regeneration.

01:39.269 --> 01:41.136
Right.

01:41.137 --> 01:42.271
In English?

01:42.272 --> 01:44.106
It accelerates life.

01:47.477 --> 01:48.744
I

01:48.745 --> 01:49.878
am

01:51.114 --> 01:52.815
Groot!

01:57.220 --> 01:58.854
Whoa. I could
make a killing

01:58.855 --> 02:00.589
in the fertilizer business.

02:00.590 --> 02:02.558
Poor word choice.

02:07.845 --> 02:09.008
I

02:09.008 --> 02:10.243
am

02:10.244 --> 02:12.945
Groot!

02:12.946 --> 02:15.348
Yo, Groot,
prune it back, will you?

02:15.349 --> 02:17.717
I am Groot!

02:19.720 --> 02:22.088
He's not in control.

02:22.089 --> 02:23.823
Cosmo
control with mind.

02:29.363 --> 02:31.030
Ah, stupid...

02:31.031 --> 02:32.732
This Cosmic Seed's
been nothing but trouble

02:32.733 --> 02:34.000
from the word "go. "

02:34.001 --> 02:35.868
So seal it up
and make it stop!

02:35.869 --> 02:37.336
You're still the key, right?

02:37.337 --> 02:39.238
Oh, yeah. Right.

02:40.007 --> 02:43.976
Oh, speaking of which, you knew I was
half-Spartax the whole time, didn't you?

02:43.977 --> 02:45.945
I bet you knew
my real dad, too.

02:45.946 --> 02:47.346
What else you been
holding out on...

02:49.383 --> 02:52.718
See? I kept him
distracted for you.

02:52.719 --> 02:54.420
Now about
my pay...

02:57.024 --> 02:58.758
This belongs to Thanos.

02:59.693 --> 03:00.760
Quill!

03:06.900 --> 03:09.035
Now that I got
your attention,

03:09.036 --> 03:11.137
what say you keep
the racket down?

03:11.138 --> 03:13.206
The neighbors
are complaining.

03:18.445 --> 03:21.080
This belongs
to Thanos, as well.

03:21.081 --> 03:23.416
The only thing
that belongs to Thanos

03:23.417 --> 03:26.285
is my revenge.

03:26.286 --> 03:28.354
Hey! Get a grip.

03:28.355 --> 03:30.957
Not on us,
bark-for-brains.

03:42.803 --> 03:44.971
I am Groot.

03:44.972 --> 03:46.305
Why couldn't
you shrink down

03:46.306 --> 03:48.341
before baldy dropped
you on top of me?

03:48.342 --> 03:50.409
Don't blame him.

03:50.410 --> 03:53.346
He was overcome
by Cosmic Seed energy.

03:53.347 --> 03:55.081
Which seems to have dissipated

03:55.082 --> 03:58.317
now that your friend
and his CryptoCube are gone.

03:58.318 --> 04:00.386
I'd sure like to know

04:00.387 --> 04:03.322
where Yondu got that box
in the first place.

04:03.323 --> 04:04.857
I am Groot.

04:04.858 --> 04:07.026
What do ya mean,
"Ask him yourself"?

04:07.027 --> 04:08.494
Don't tell me
Yondu's here, too.

04:08.495 --> 04:09.962
Not anymore.

04:09.963 --> 04:11.964
Yondu is small potato.

04:11.965 --> 04:15.368
We see what tiny energy
do to tree and Celestial head.

04:15.369 --> 04:19.372
Imagine what entire
Cosmic Seed can do, da?

04:19.373 --> 04:21.874
It could spawn
a new galaxy.

04:21.875 --> 04:25.044
Or, in the wrong hands,
destroy one.

04:25.045 --> 04:26.512
Hands don't get
any wronger

04:26.513 --> 04:28.381
than Korath's
boss, Thanos.

04:28.382 --> 04:31.417
We need to fire up
the Milano. As in now.

04:31.418 --> 04:33.352
Ship will not
be necessary.

04:33.353 --> 04:36.322
Cosmo know, how
you say, short cut.

04:39.359 --> 04:41.027
Continuum Cortex.

04:43.363 --> 04:45.298
Built into Knowhere's brain,

04:45.299 --> 04:47.566
is nexus point
to anywhere in universe.

04:49.836 --> 04:51.537
Cosmo beam you
onto Korath ship,

04:51.538 --> 04:53.272
so you head them off at pass.

04:56.443 --> 04:58.511
Please do wear
passport wristbands.

04:58.512 --> 05:00.513
Extras are for friends.

05:04.851 --> 05:07.286
Activate and
Cosmo retrieve you.

05:07.287 --> 05:11.857
Because Cosmo is retriever,
da?

05:13.927 --> 05:16.929
Retriever is breed
of Earth dog.

05:16.930 --> 05:18.197
Eh, never mind.

05:18.198 --> 05:20.366
Joke not funny
if Cosmo must explain.

05:21.201 --> 05:22.835
I am Groot.

05:22.836 --> 05:24.303
What do you mean,
you don't trust him?

05:24.304 --> 05:26.105
What'd a dog ever
do to a tree?

05:26.106 --> 05:27.239
Any questions?

05:27.240 --> 05:29.508
As a matter of fact...

05:29.509 --> 05:31.344
I believe
the rodent wishes to borrow

05:31.345 --> 05:33.479
from your enormous
stockpile of weapons.

05:34.114 --> 05:37.383
Oh, yeah!

05:37.384 --> 05:40.486
Lord Thanos, I am pleased
to report that I have recovered

05:40.487 --> 05:42.855
the Cosmic Seed
CryptoCube,

05:42.856 --> 05:44.457
as well as its key.

05:45.359 --> 05:47.059
Hey, how you doing?

05:47.060 --> 05:48.861
"Recovered"?

05:48.862 --> 05:52.365
I was not aware that
you had lost it, Korath.

05:52.366 --> 05:55.301
You know what happens when
my children disappoint me.

05:59.339 --> 06:01.474
I am well aware, my Lord.

06:01.475 --> 06:03.376
That is why I brought back
the prodigal...

06:07.481 --> 06:08.948
...daughter.

06:10.417 --> 06:13.285
Bring Gamora
to me, alive.

06:13.286 --> 06:16.088
I will deal with
her in person.

06:16.423 --> 06:17.990
Uh-oh.

06:17.991 --> 06:20.326
♪ Somebody's in trouble ♪

06:22.896 --> 06:24.463
Ah-ah!

06:24.464 --> 06:27.032
Daddy's not gonna like it
if you bust his key.

06:34.040 --> 06:36.409
Talk about anger issues.

06:40.647 --> 06:42.381
Open it. Now!

06:42.382 --> 06:44.116
And why
would I do that?

06:53.493 --> 06:55.161
To save her.

07:07.307 --> 07:10.409
Not fair. Her daddy
wants her alive.

07:10.410 --> 07:12.144
And she will be.

07:12.145 --> 07:14.480
But she will wish
she was not.

07:14.481 --> 07:17.016
This is
a cerebral parasite.

07:17.017 --> 07:19.318
It extracts
all her guilty memories

07:19.319 --> 07:21.353
and forces her
to experience

07:21.354 --> 07:23.422
all the pain she
inflicted in the past.

07:23.423 --> 07:24.623
No!

07:24.624 --> 07:28.527
Now, open the box.

07:32.432 --> 07:35.134
Your choice, Star-Lord.

07:35.135 --> 07:38.170
Open the box,
or let her suffer.

07:40.474 --> 07:42.007
All right, all right!

07:42.008 --> 07:43.542
Just make it stop.

07:43.543 --> 07:45.578
Quill, don't
give in to him.

07:49.216 --> 07:51.183
Quill, you imbecile.

07:51.184 --> 07:53.152
You don't know
what you're unleashing.

07:53.153 --> 07:54.987
Open it.

07:56.323 --> 07:57.590
Now!

08:01.628 --> 08:03.128
Say what?

08:10.437 --> 08:12.404
Man, oh, I'd hate
to be in your shoes

08:12.405 --> 08:15.107
when you hand Thanos
an empty box!

08:15.108 --> 08:17.543
You realize this means
that you are no longer

08:17.544 --> 08:20.312
useful to me as the key.

08:20.313 --> 08:22.248
And Thanos' punishment

08:22.249 --> 08:23.782
will be nothing
compared to the pain

08:23.783 --> 08:27.219
you are about to experience.

08:27.220 --> 08:28.387
Korath, no.

08:28.388 --> 08:30.656
He'll never survive
the guilty memories.

08:33.493 --> 08:35.227
Okay, there was
a time in the second grade

08:35.227 --> 08:36.761
when I smacked Mikey Coogan
on the playground,

08:36.763 --> 08:38.429
but he totally deserved it.

08:38.431 --> 08:40.466
Then there was that
Aaskvarian I dated once

08:40.467 --> 08:42.668
and never called, but you
know, she had an attitude.

08:42.669 --> 08:44.035
Figures.

08:44.037 --> 08:46.305
Quill has no guilt
about anything.

08:51.211 --> 08:53.746
Then we will just
have to inflict pain

08:53.747 --> 08:55.681
the old-fashioned way.

08:59.452 --> 09:03.522
Aw, and you'd just
had that wall fixed.

09:03.523 --> 09:05.391
Attack them, you fools!

09:06.493 --> 09:07.826
I am Groot!

09:15.769 --> 09:19.138
I have a message
for your boss, Thanos.

09:19.139 --> 09:22.274
Tell him when he's man enough
to stop hiding behind lackeys

09:22.275 --> 09:25.544
and show his face,
Drax will be ready for him.

09:27.747 --> 09:30.683
Careful what you wish for.

09:30.684 --> 09:33.218
Don't know how
you guys got here so fast.

09:33.219 --> 09:35.154
Just wish it was before
I had to open this.

09:35.455 --> 09:36.855
Wha... Wait.

09:36.856 --> 09:38.757
You mean I had
to bust your hairless hide

09:38.758 --> 09:43.362
out of this place,
twice, for an empty box?

09:43.363 --> 09:45.130
Well, when you
put it that way...

09:48.368 --> 09:49.768
Fine.

09:49.769 --> 09:51.270
Hey, I'll clear a path

09:51.271 --> 09:53.472
through the guards
to the ship.

09:53.473 --> 09:55.374
All right, here we go.
Comin' through!

09:55.375 --> 09:56.842
Quill, wait!
We didn't take the...

10:02.215 --> 10:04.116
You're a traitor
to Thanos,

10:04.117 --> 10:07.519
and you will
pay for your sins, sister.

10:08.555 --> 10:11.790
You first, brother.

10:18.865 --> 10:21.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

10:28.708 --> 10:30.342
Show off.

10:38.718 --> 10:40.452
We're surrounded.

10:40.453 --> 10:42.321
Just put this on
and don't ask questions.

10:44.290 --> 10:45.691
Don't worry,
I got this.

10:45.692 --> 10:47.559
Just hold your breath
until we get to the ship.

10:49.295 --> 10:50.562
Quill, no!
I am Groot!

11:00.707 --> 11:02.341
Uh, where's the ship?

11:03.410 --> 11:05.210
Cosmo is retrieving.

11:05.211 --> 11:06.679
Please do not be dead.

11:12.352 --> 11:14.420
Where's Quill?

11:21.461 --> 11:22.961
How about a little
warning next time?

11:23.930 --> 11:25.431
Should I warn you

11:25.432 --> 11:27.399
if this is only set to stun?

11:27.400 --> 11:29.301
Yeah.

11:31.871 --> 11:33.472
Oops. Forgot.

11:36.643 --> 11:37.976
Clearly,
the Cosmic Seed

11:37.977 --> 11:41.280
was inside the CryptoCube
at one time.

11:41.281 --> 11:43.282
Its residual energy
must've reanimated

11:43.283 --> 11:46.452
some of Knowhere's
biological functions.

11:46.453 --> 11:48.687
But that energy
is mostly depleted now.

11:48.688 --> 11:52.558
Still, it's a fine example
of Spartax workmanship,

11:52.559 --> 11:54.693
even without its key.

11:54.694 --> 11:57.396
I'll give you
500 units for it.

11:57.397 --> 11:58.630
You kiddin' me?

11:58.631 --> 12:00.265
There's more
than 500 units worth

12:00.266 --> 12:01.967
of lint in that dust-catcher.

12:01.968 --> 12:03.702
I'll take it.
Wait.

12:03.703 --> 12:05.537
You can't.

12:05.538 --> 12:07.673
Didn't you want to toss it
into the nearest black hole?

12:07.674 --> 12:10.676
I did, but aren't you just
a little curious to learn

12:10.677 --> 12:12.578
why you're the only one
who can open it?

12:18.251 --> 12:19.985
Peter, my little Star-Lord.

12:23.590 --> 12:26.291
So what?
I'm half-Spartax.

12:26.292 --> 12:28.360
I could be half-kangaroo,
for all I care.

12:30.497 --> 12:33.432
Does not take mind
reader to know it's not true.

12:34.868 --> 12:37.736
We are nothing
without our past.

12:37.737 --> 12:39.338
And someday,
I would like to meet

12:39.339 --> 12:40.806
one of these kangaroos.

12:40.807 --> 12:42.441
No doubt they are
fine warriors.

12:42.442 --> 12:44.943
Fine.

12:44.944 --> 12:46.545
Let's take the 500 units

12:46.546 --> 12:48.447
and run before
he changes his mind.

12:48.448 --> 12:49.882
Or something else goes wrong.

12:51.317 --> 12:52.484
Uh, uh...

12:52.485 --> 12:54.419
Had to jinx it,
didn't you?

12:54.420 --> 12:57.623
And did I mention
that I hate that sound?

12:57.624 --> 12:59.958
I understand there has
been a request

12:59.959 --> 13:03.495
for me to stop hiding
behind lackeys

13:03.496 --> 13:06.331
and show my face.

13:06.332 --> 13:08.500
I am ready
for you, Thanos.

13:09.736 --> 13:12.771
I demand the CryptoCube now!

13:12.772 --> 13:17.576
And the cowardly thief
who calls himself Star-Lord.

13:18.411 --> 13:19.578
Hey, cool!

13:19.579 --> 13:21.647
Thanos called me Star-Lord.

13:23.150 --> 13:26.185
I demand
the CryptoCube now

13:26.186 --> 13:29.522
or Knowhere, and all
of its inhabitants,

13:29.523 --> 13:32.525
will face
certain annihilation.

13:32.526 --> 13:35.094
Okay, I just have to think
of a way out of this.

13:35.095 --> 13:38.364
You have 30 seconds
to comply.

13:38.365 --> 13:40.066
I just have to think
really fast.

13:40.067 --> 13:42.468
Let's just give
Pruney Chin what he wants.

13:42.469 --> 13:44.203
The box is useless, anyway.

13:44.204 --> 13:46.872
So's Quill, but I'm not
about to hand him over.

13:46.873 --> 13:48.441
Hey!
I am Groot!

13:48.442 --> 13:50.509
Good point.
Cosmo not want

13:50.510 --> 13:52.378
all of Knowhere
blowing up either.

13:52.379 --> 13:54.380
Well, what do
you think, Drax?

13:54.381 --> 13:55.848
Drax?

13:55.849 --> 13:57.583
Aw, man!

14:02.022 --> 14:05.558
Thanos!
You destroyed my family!

14:05.559 --> 14:08.994
Now face your destroyer!

14:16.203 --> 14:19.572
I will have my revenge!

14:25.579 --> 14:28.247
That is your answer,
Star-Lord.

14:28.248 --> 14:29.982
Here is mine.

14:37.491 --> 14:39.592
Okay, fine.

14:39.593 --> 14:41.026
I'll turn myself
and the box

14:41.027 --> 14:43.662
over to the crazy dude
with the raisin face.

14:43.663 --> 14:45.364
It won't do any good now.

14:45.365 --> 14:48.067
Thanos will destroy Knowhere
just to make an example.

14:53.073 --> 14:55.908
Way to use your big brain,
chrome-dome.

14:58.011 --> 14:59.378
Big brain...

15:03.917 --> 15:06.085
Quill, where are you going?

15:06.086 --> 15:07.620
To end this
once and for all.

15:10.957 --> 15:14.193
You have persistence.

15:16.930 --> 15:18.597
I hate persistence.

15:28.041 --> 15:29.708
What will it take
to destroy you?

15:31.011 --> 15:33.078
Much more
than you have.

15:39.986 --> 15:42.087
Where have you
gone, Destroyer?

15:44.191 --> 15:45.458
Let me go.

15:45.459 --> 15:47.059
I had him right
where I wanted him.

15:53.066 --> 15:55.634
Hey, wait up!

15:55.635 --> 15:59.004
Quill, are you doing something
stupid and reckless in there?

15:59.005 --> 16:00.272
Kinda.

16:00.273 --> 16:02.141
Look, if Thanos
still wants this box,

16:02.142 --> 16:03.642
then it must
still be dangerous.

16:03.643 --> 16:05.344
I can't let him
get his hands on it.

16:05.345 --> 16:07.213
So let us in
and we'll help you.

16:07.214 --> 16:08.714
No can do.

16:08.715 --> 16:10.649
If I'm the key, there's
only one way out of this.

16:10.650 --> 16:13.419
No! You are not gonna
teleport yourself

16:13.420 --> 16:14.520
into the nearest black hole.

16:14.521 --> 16:15.988
You hear me, Quill?

16:21.661 --> 16:23.429
Come on, come on!

16:33.106 --> 16:34.406
I will not

16:34.407 --> 16:36.408
be denied my revenge!

16:40.013 --> 16:42.314
You will be denied your life.

16:47.420 --> 16:49.288
Let this serve
as an example

16:49.289 --> 16:53.158
for all those who defy
the will of Thanos!

16:56.096 --> 16:58.163
Gah! That is it, Quill!

16:58.164 --> 17:00.366
You ain't taking the
collapsar plunge on my watch.

17:03.036 --> 17:04.069
Huh?

17:04.069 --> 17:05.738
Telekinetic override

17:05.739 --> 17:08.339
is much more effective
than big boom, da?

17:12.811 --> 17:17.049
Knowhere's trying to stop him
from teleporting. But why?

17:17.050 --> 17:20.085
Quill not using
Continuum Cortex as teleport.

17:20.086 --> 17:22.721
Is using as brain.

17:22.722 --> 17:25.190
You mean he's trying
to drive the giant head?

17:26.626 --> 17:28.093
Got that right.

17:28.094 --> 17:31.397
I may be half-human,
but I'm all hero.

17:49.282 --> 17:53.085
I am Groot?
I have no idea.

17:55.822 --> 17:57.823
Obliterate them all!

17:57.824 --> 18:00.859
Show no mercy!

18:02.829 --> 18:06.131
Okay, taking
her out for a spin.

18:08.168 --> 18:10.202
I am Groot!

18:24.317 --> 18:26.151
I can't control it.

18:26.152 --> 18:29.388
Always were
a lousy pilot, Quill.

18:29.389 --> 18:31.123
You think you
could do better?

18:32.459 --> 18:34.460
I think we can do better.

18:44.304 --> 18:47.172
Go left. Left!
Your other left!

18:47.173 --> 18:49.408
Don't tell me how to drive.

18:49.409 --> 18:51.443
Kids, stop fighting or I will

18:51.444 --> 18:53.245
turn this giant head
around right now.

18:53.246 --> 18:54.546
Not to worry.

18:55.215 --> 18:56.782
Cosmo has idea.

18:56.783 --> 18:59.485
Please to divert all
Cortex teleportational field

18:59.486 --> 19:00.819
to external output.

19:02.789 --> 19:04.456
This gonna be one of those

19:04.457 --> 19:05.924
"we only got
one shot at this" deals?

19:05.925 --> 19:08.627
Da, setting
coordinates now.

19:31.184 --> 19:33.952
I am Groot.

19:33.953 --> 19:36.855
Excellent question,
my deciduous comrade.

19:36.856 --> 19:40.659
Cosmo teleport Knowhere to
remote sector of galaxy, eh?

19:40.660 --> 19:42.928
Thanos not find for some time.

19:42.929 --> 19:44.763
But he will find us.

19:44.764 --> 19:47.366
Why wait?
Send us back now.

19:47.367 --> 19:49.401
I will destroy him
with my bare hands.

19:51.438 --> 19:53.672
What?

19:53.673 --> 19:56.842
Cosmo thanks you, Peter
Quill, who is also called Star-Lord.

19:56.843 --> 19:59.812
Guardians of Galaxy
welcome back anytime.

19:59.813 --> 20:02.548
Is Knowhere like home, da?

20:02.549 --> 20:04.650
Guess I've never been big
on the whole home thing.

20:18.431 --> 20:21.266
You're thinking about going
to Spartax, aren't you?

20:21.267 --> 20:23.802
I didn't say that.

20:23.803 --> 20:26.271
You're gonna sell
that thing, right?

20:26.272 --> 20:27.740
I didn't say that either.

20:28.908 --> 20:30.542
I am Groot!

20:30.543 --> 20:32.678
Definitely
didn't say that.

20:32.679 --> 20:35.714
There's no shame in wanting to
seek out your true heritage.

20:37.917 --> 20:40.419
You know, when I was a kid
every time I'd stick up

20:40.420 --> 20:42.521
for someone weaker than me,
my mom would always say,

20:42.522 --> 20:44.323
"You remind me
of your daddy. "

20:44.324 --> 20:46.925
But she also said that
every time I'd lose my temper

20:46.926 --> 20:48.527
or do something
reckless and foolish.

20:49.796 --> 20:50.863
Right now, I think you guys

20:50.864 --> 20:52.965
are the only family
I can handle.

20:52.966 --> 20:54.900
♪ Get lost
in your rock and roll

20:54.901 --> 20:56.835
♪ And drift away ♪

21:06.913 --> 21:08.947
Oh!

21:08.948 --> 21:11.817
So that's why Thanos
wanted an empty box.

21:11.818 --> 21:13.485
It's a map.

21:13.486 --> 21:15.954
A map that can lead us
to the Cosmic Seed.

21:18.658 --> 21:21.607
This is gonna be
one heck of a ride.
