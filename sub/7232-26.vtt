- AHA.
RIGHT, I FORGOT.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.201
- THEN MAYBE YOU CAN ALSO FORGET
WHAT WE SAW, BUDDY.

17:57.284 --> 18:02.456
EITHER WAY, MAKE SURE
WE NEVER SEE IT EVER AGAIN.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.960
- AND THAT'S HOW WE GOT HERE.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.796
- GUYS, IF COVERTON'S
UP TO SOMETHING THAT TERRIBLE,

18:08.879 --> 18:11.006
WE NEED TO STOP IT.

18:11.089 --> 18:11.965
- AGREED.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.300
- [growling]

18:13.383 --> 18:14.593
- GAME FACES.

18:14.676 --> 18:15.969
WHO KNOWS
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH?

18:16.053 --> 18:18.096
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE
I'VE SAID THAT BEFORE?

18:18.180 --> 18:21.475
- [growling]

18:21.558 --> 18:24.686
[all screaming]

18:24.770 --> 18:27.189
- NOW I REMEMBER
WHAT IT WAS!

18:27.272 --> 18:29.274
- AND I REMEMBER WHY I WANTED
TO FORGET IT.

18:29.358 --> 18:33.195
- MEMORY WIPE?
- MEMORY WIPE SO HARD.

18:33.278 --> 18:37.533
- AND NOW THE 10:00 NEWS
WITH ME, CHUCK CHARLES!

18:37.616 --> 18:39.159
- DID WE JUST LOSE
ANOTHER HOUR?

18:39.243 --> 18:40.661
- I...THINK SO.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.163
- YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
GOING TO COVERTON'S QUARTERS.

18:43.247 --> 18:46.208
- BUT I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT WAS INSIDE.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.043
- RIGHT. LET'S FIND OUT
WHAT COVERTON'S HIDING.

18:48.126 --> 18:51.755
- LET IT GO, SUSAN.
YOU'LL BE HAPPIER.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.550
- THE HECK I WILL!

18:54.633 --> 18:57.845
[all screaming]

18:57.928 --> 18:59.137

19:01.765 --> 19:05.727
WITH JIMMY'S SPECIAL GUEST,
BRAD CLOONEY.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.896
- WE LOST ANOTHER HOUR?

19:07.980 --> 19:12.651
- LISTEN TO OL' B.O.B.
LET IT GO!

19:12.734 --> 19:15.279
- WE CAN'T DO THAT, B.O.B.

19:16.655 --> 19:20.409
- DON'T LIKE, DON'T LIKE!
- MEMORY WIPE ME NOW!

19:20.492 --> 19:22.744
- SHOULD'VE LISTENED
TO OL' B.O.B.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.455
- THE MIDNIGHT MOVIE MARATHON

19:25.539 --> 19:30.002
BEGINS NOW WITH
<i>BRIDE OF THE ZOMBIE MOON APE.</i>

19:30.085 --> 19:32.254
- MIDNIGHT?
NO WAY!

19:32.337 --> 19:34.256
- SERIOUSLY?
WE'RE DOING THIS AGAIN?

19:34.339 --> 19:36.592
ALSO, I MADE YOU THIS.
[chuckles]

19:37.968 --> 19:40.053
[all screaming]

19:41.221 --> 19:42.264
[all screaming]

19:43.640 --> 19:45.767
[all screaming]

19:45.851 --> 19:47.477
- GUYS, I'M WRITING A NOVEL!

19:47.561 --> 19:50.939
IT'S CALLED <i> THE BLOB</i>
<i>NOBODY EVER LISTENED TO.</i>

19:51.023 --> 19:54.943
- GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY!
IT'S 7:00 IN THE A.M.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.778
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE YOUR PANTS ARE?

19:56.862 --> 19:58.655
- I THINK WE'VE LOST
A WHOLE DAY NOW.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.490
- UGH, OKAY.
WE MAKE A PACT.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.576
WHATEVER WE SEE,
WE LIVE WITH IT.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.161
NO MEMORY WIPING.
- [typing]

20:04.244 --> 20:07.706
OKAY, BUT THIS TIME,
I'M HOLDING YOU TO IT

20:07.789 --> 20:11.919
BECAUSE I REALLY,
REALLY HATE RESPONSIBILITY.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.962
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.298
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
WE STAY STRONG.

20:16.381 --> 20:19.259

20:37.736 --> 20:39.696
[all screaming]

20:39.780 --> 20:43.992
[all retching]

20:44.076 --> 20:46.703
- SERIOUSLY?
DON'T YOU PEOPLE EVER KNOCK?

20:46.787 --> 20:49.164
- IT ATE COVERTON!

20:49.247 --> 20:51.458
- DON'T BE LUDICROUS,
FISH-APE.

20:51.541 --> 20:54.294
THIS IS
MY REJUVENATION CHRYSALIS.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.672
MY PEOPLE DO THIS ONCE A YEAR.

20:56.755 --> 20:57.631
- [gags]

20:57.714 --> 20:59.633
- CHECK ME OUT.

20:59.716 --> 21:03.261
I HAVE THE JOWLS

21:03.345 --> 21:06.098
AND OOH, MY TOENAILS--

21:06.181 --> 21:09.476

WITH THAT SWEET MEMORY WIPER!

21:12.813 --> 21:14.314
HIT ME HARD!
- NOPE.

21:14.398 --> 21:15.857
IF I HAVE TO LIVE WITH
THE MEMORY OF WHAT WE SAW,

21:15.941 --> 21:17.651
THEN SO DO YOU GUYS.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.987
[gulps]

21:20.070 --> 21:23.198
all: NO!

21:23.281 --> 21:23.949
- BUT I'LL SEE
COVERTON'S ICKINESS

21:24.032 --> 21:26.827
EVEN WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.203
I'LL NEVER FORGET.

21:28.286 --> 21:29.788
- PERHAPS THERE IS
ANOTHER WAY.

21:29.871 --> 21:31.206
[beeps]

21:31.289 --> 21:31.748
- [gasps]
<i>SENATOR CHIMP?</i>
