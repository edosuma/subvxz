02:12.549 --> 02:14.217
BACK OFF, MAN.

02:14.300 --> 02:18.221
HEY, YOU GUYS.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:18.304 --> 02:20.348
YOU'RE A WUSS,
SANDERS.

02:20.431 --> 02:21.224
I'LL KILL YOU!

02:21.307 --> 02:23.059
EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.686
EVERYTHING'S
COOL.

02:24.769 --> 02:26.396
EVERYTHING'S
FINE.

02:26.479 --> 02:27.856
ALL RIGHT.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.899
{\an1}WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?

02:29.983 --> 02:33.152
HE SAID SOMETHING
STUPID ABOUT MY MOM.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.863
{\an1}YOU FIGHT
OVER YOUR MOM?

02:34.946 --> 02:38.449
IT BUGS ME WHEN THEY SAY
SHE'S WASHED UP.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.910
THE JERK WAS
SMALLER THAN ME.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.080
{\an1}HE WAS BUILT
LIKE A WIDE-LOAD TRUCK.

02:44.163 --> 02:46.624
{\an1}IT COULD HAVE
HAPPENED TO ME.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.918
{\an1}NO.
PROBABLY NOT ME.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.253
HA HA HA!

02:50.336 --> 02:53.464
YOU KNOW WHAT,
WALSH?

02:54.632 --> 02:58.469
I'M GLAD YOU
MOVED TO TOWN.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.601
{\an5}DO YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON
UPSTAIRS?

03:04.684 --> 03:08.688
{\an5}LET ME GUESS.
COFFLER INDUSTRIES
WENT BELLY UP.

03:08.771 --> 03:09.606
WORSE.

03:09.689 --> 03:12.317
HENRY POWELL
IS IN TOWN.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.151
{\an1}YOU SURE?

03:13.234 --> 03:16.571
GANS SAW HIM.
YOU KNOW WHY HE'S HERE?

03:16.654 --> 03:18.948
{\an1}DON'T GET
PARANOID ON ME.

03:19.032 --> 03:19.574
PARANOID?

03:19.657 --> 03:21.492
DENVER LET
EIGHT GUYS GO.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.453
HENRY POWELL
WOULDN'T BE HERE

03:23.536 --> 03:25.163
UNLESS HEADS
ARE GOING TO ROLL.

03:25.246 --> 03:28.625
{\an1}I'VE BEEN WITH
THE COMPANY FOR 12 YEARS.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.586
{\an1}HENRY POWELL'S ALWAYS BEEN...
PROFESSIONAL WITH ME.

03:31.669 --> 03:36.090
{\an5}WELL,
JUST HOPE HE DOESN'T
INVITE YOU TO LUNCH.

03:53.775 --> 03:54.984
CILANTRO BASIL.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.529
{\an1}WAS IT A TWO-FOR-ONE SALE
TODAY, MOM?

03:58.613 --> 04:01.115
IT WAS SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

04:01.199 --> 04:04.160
ANNA AND I DROVE
TO THIS NURSERY

04:04.243 --> 04:06.120
THAT SPECIALIZES
IN HERBS.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.998
WOULD YOU MIND
DRIVING HER HOME?

04:09.082 --> 04:09.832
NO PROBLEM.

04:09.916 --> 04:14.045
{\an1}IF WE GO NOW,
WE CAN BEAT THE TRAFFIC.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.505

04:23.638 --> 04:26.349
I'M IN DEEP TROUBLE
AT WORK.

04:26.432 --> 04:27.517
WHAT'S WRONG?

04:27.600 --> 04:30.520
HENRY POWELL
ASKED ME TO LUNCH.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.187
AND?

04:31.270 --> 04:33.523
NOT DRINKS,
NOT BREAKFAST.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.190
SO?

04:34.274 --> 04:37.193
BY THE TIME
YOU GET BACK,

04:37.276 --> 04:39.320
YOU'RE OUT OF A JOB.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.196
{\an1}OH, HONEY.

04:40.279 --> 04:43.658
SIMONS SAYS THEY'VE
GOT A CONTINGENCY PLAN

04:43.741 --> 04:46.869
TO DUMP 25%
OF THE OFFICE.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.997
{\an1}DID YOU TALK
TO HIM?

04:49.080 --> 04:50.540
WHAT SHOULD I SAY?

04:50.623 --> 04:52.542
"LET'S TALK ABOUT
GETTING AXED"?

04:52.625 --> 04:54.877
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'D DO THAT.

04:54.961 --> 04:58.840
THESE AREN'T THE BEST
OF ECONOMIC TIMES, BREN.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.425

LAID OFF.

05:00.508 --> 05:04.595
{\an4}REMEMBER WHEN
JOHN CARTER'S FATHER
LOST HIS JOB?

05:04.679 --> 05:06.389
{\an1}THEIR HOUSE
GOT REPOSSESSED,

05:06.472 --> 05:09.559
{\an1}AND WE NEVER HEARD
FROM THEM AGAIN.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.310

THEY EVAPORATED.

IT WOULD BE ONLY
THE TWO OF US.

WOUNDED IN THE LINE
OF DUTY, MOM.

06:08.868 --> 06:12.413
{\an1}THAT WAS YOUR NAME

06:24.342 --> 06:26.302
IF MY MOM MICROWAVES
FROZEN PEAS.

06:26.385 --> 06:30.556
{\an5}MY DAD SHOULD SEND
CHILD SUPPORT HERE
FOR FEEDING ME.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.018

TO GET USED TO IT HERE.

08:00.521 --> 08:04.734

DON'T COME KNOCKING EVERY DAY.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.737

09:04.543 --> 09:05.753
THREE TO STAY?

09:05.836 --> 09:07.630
JIM, LET ME EXPLAIN.

09:07.713 --> 09:08.965
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.802
{\an1}THE WALSH FAMILY
HAS SPOKEN.

09:13.552 --> 09:16.847
{\an1}I'LL PASS
THE WORD ALONG.

09:26.607 --> 09:28.818
THAT WAS SURREAL.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.152
YEAH.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.154
I FEEL BAD FOR DAD,

09:32.238 --> 09:33.823

09:35.741 --> 09:38.661
{\an1}IT WOULD BE LIKE
REVERSE CULTURE SHOCK.

09:38.744 --> 09:42.665
{\an1}IT WAS GREAT OF HIM

09:47.920 --> 09:49.672

09:49.755 --> 09:51.841

09:51.924 --> 09:53.968
{\an1}I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU VOTED

09:54.051 --> 09:56.304
{\an1}TO STAY
IN BEVERLY HILLS.

09:56.387 --> 09:57.722
I EXPECTED A TIE,

09:57.805 --> 10:00.349
{\an1}AND BRANDON WOULD SWITCH
UNDER PRESSURE.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.561
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS
FAIR FOR THEM.

10:03.644 --> 10:06.564
{\an1}JIM WALSH
FOR MR. POWELL, PLEASE.

10:06.647 --> 10:10.693
{\an4}BLOWING MY CAREER
WON'T BE FAIR FOR THEM,

10:10.776 --> 10:12.570
MR. POWELL--

10:12.653 --> 10:15.323
ALL RIGHT--HENRY.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.408
YES...I DID...

10:17.491 --> 10:19.702
{\an1}AND THE CONSENSUS
IS, I'M AFRAID,

10:19.785 --> 10:25.541
{\an1}I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
TURN DOWN YOUR GENEROUS OFFER.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.044
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

10:28.127 --> 10:29.920
WHAT?

10:31.630 --> 10:33.924
YES, SIR.

10:34.675 --> 10:36.010
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:36.093 --> 10:38.346
DID THAT
S.O.B. FIRE YOU?

10:38.429 --> 10:40.973
{\an1}THAT S.O.B JUST
DOUBLED MY SALARY.

10:41.057 --> 10:44.352
{\an5}I'M SORRY,
BUT THE BLIND BALLOT'S
BEEN CALLED

10:44.435 --> 10:46.479
{\an1}ON ACCOUNT
OF A WINDFALL.

10:46.562 --> 10:47.772
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:47.855 --> 10:50.608
{\an1}WE'RE GOING
BACK TO MINNEAPOLIS.

11:00.576 --> 11:03.120
{\an1}I THINK WE NEED
TWO SCOOPS TONIGHT.

11:03.204 --> 11:06.582
{\an1}I'M SO UNABLE
TO COMPUTE EVEN GOING BACK.

11:06.665 --> 11:09.085
{\an1}THERE'S TIMES
THAT I WANTED TO.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.753
I NEVER WANTED
TO COME.

11:10.836 --> 11:13.923
{\an1}I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
SO GLAMOROUS.

11:14.006 --> 11:17.093
NOW IT'S JUST STARTING
TO FEEL...RIGHT.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.553
NAT JUST
GAVE ME A RAISE.

11:19.637 --> 11:23.265
{\an1}I HAVE THE BEST BOYFRIEND
IN THE WORLD.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.769
{\an1}I WAS TRYING OUT
FOR <i> ROMEO AND JULIET.</i>

11:26.852 --> 11:28.979
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

11:29.063 --> 11:29.605
COOL.

11:29.688 --> 11:31.774
{\an1}YEAH,
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.943
HOW CAN DAD DO THIS?

11:34.026 --> 11:37.113
GOT TO SEE
HIS SIDE OF IT, BREN.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.948
HE'LL BE
A MAJOR PLAYER.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.783
IT'S GOING TO
LOOK BIZARRE,

11:40.866 --> 11:43.911
{\an1}LIKE WE HAD TO RUN
BACK TO MINNEAPOLIS.

11:43.994 --> 11:44.954
PEOPLE WILL SAY,

11:45.037 --> 11:48.499
{\an4}"THOSE WALSHES
COULDN'T CUT IT
IN BEVERLY HILLS."

11:48.582 --> 11:50.459
YOU NEED
ANOTHER SCOOP.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.962
I KNOW IT'S
A BIG CHANGE,

11:53.045 --> 11:55.005
BUT EVERYTHING
WILL BE FINE.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.091
{\an1}SO WHEN'S
THE BIG MOVE?

11:57.174 --> 11:59.009
YOUR DAD
STARTS IMMEDIATELY.

11:59.093 --> 12:02.972
THE COMPANY'S LEASE HERE
ENDS JUNE 1st.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.974
THAT'S OUR MOVING DAY.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.308
THAT'S SO SOON.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.977
I'M SORRY, HONEY,

12:08.060 --> 12:09.145
BUT YOU'LL SEE.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.481
IT'S GOING TO BE
GREAT.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.858
WHO NEEDS A HOUSE?

12:13.941 --> 12:16.861
WHY DON'T WE JUST
GET A MOBILE HOME?

12:16.944 --> 12:20.406
{\an4}DO YOU THINK
MOM'S REALLY HAPPY
ABOUT THE MOVE?

12:20.489 --> 12:23.492
SHE NEVER ADJUSTED
TO LIFE IN CALIFORNIA.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.996
{\an1}I THINK
SHE LIKES IT HERE.

12:28.205 --> 12:30.291
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:30.374 --> 12:31.834
YOU'LL SEE.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.211
I HOPE IT'S NOT

12:34.295 --> 12:35.963
ANOTHER BLIND BALLOT.

12:36.046 --> 12:37.882
NO. PROS AND CONS.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.049
MINNESOTA OVER HERE.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.343
BEVERLY HILLS
ON THE RIGHT.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.971
OK. PROS OF LEAVING.

12:44.054 --> 12:47.975
{\an4}SEASONS.
SEEING THE LEAVES
CHANGE COLOR.

12:48.058 --> 12:50.060
RAKING THE LEAVES.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.103
UH...

12:51.187 --> 12:54.774
{\an4}SNOW.
REMEMBER THE FIRST
SNOW FIGHT OF THE YEAR?

12:54.857 --> 12:56.692
DON'T FORGET
ABOUT THE SLUSH,

12:56.775 --> 13:00.237
THE WET SOCKS,
THE FROZEN NOSES.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.032
ICE HOCKEY.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.034
THE BEACH.
THE SUN.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.661
{\an1}THE LAKES.
THE WATER SKIING.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.705
SURFING.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.041
OLD FRIENDS.

13:12.124 --> 13:16.837
MAYBE THEY'VE
MOVED ON, TOO.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.298
NEW FRIENDS.

13:20.799 --> 13:23.761
SOON TO BE
EX-FRIENDS.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.227
MAYBE WE'LL MEET UP
IN COLLEGE.

13:31.310 --> 13:35.105
{\an1}SURE. WE COULD
MOVE BACK OUT HERE.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.065
ANYWAY, ANDREA,

13:36.148 --> 13:39.276
{\an1}YOU'RE GOING TO BE
AT SOME IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.780
YOU GUYS COULD STILL
COME AND VISIT US.

13:42.863 --> 13:43.739
RIGHT.

13:43.822 --> 13:46.909
{\an1}WHY DON'T YOU STAY WITH ME
THROUGH THE SUMMER?

13:46.992 --> 13:49.537
KELLY, THAT WOULD
BE SUPER.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.329
YES, IT WOULD.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.915
{\an1}BRANDON, STASH YOURSELF
AT MY PLACE.

13:52.998 --> 13:57.461
{\an5}THANKS,
BUT I FEEL OBLIGATED
TO GO WITH MY FAMILY.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.631
{\an1}HERE TODAY,
GONE TO MINNESOTA.

14:00.714 --> 14:04.760
BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE
THE OFFER, MAN. THANKS.

14:04.843 --> 14:07.179
RIGHT.

14:12.643 --> 14:15.813
{\an4}I'M SORRY
ABOUT LEAVING YOU
IN THE LURCH.

14:15.896 --> 14:18.107
THAT'S NOT
WHAT'S BUGGING ME.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.776
I GOT ALONG
WITHOUT YOU BEFORE.

14:20.859 --> 14:23.237
{\an5}I'LL GET ALONG
WITHOUT YOU NOW.

14:23.320 --> 14:27.116
THAT MAKES ME
FEEL NEEDED.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.117
IT'S JUST, LIKE,

14:28.200 --> 14:31.328
I GOT USED TO
HAVING YOU AROUND.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.080
{\an1}YEAH. ME, TOO,
BUDDY.

14:33.163 --> 14:33.455
{\an1}ME, TOO.

14:33.539 --> 14:34.748
YEAH.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.792
GET OUT OF HERE.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.127
ANDREA, HEY.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.462
WHAT CAN I
DO YOU FOR?

14:40.546 --> 14:44.300
WELL,
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.259
YOU ALWAYS ARE.

14:45.342 --> 14:48.345
{\an5}WE'VE HAD SOME
PRETTY GOOD TIMES
TOGETHER.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.306
{\an1}WE CERTAINLY HAVE.
WE'RE PALS.

14:50.389 --> 14:53.809
WELL, I HAVE
A PROPOSAL FOR YOU.

14:53.892 --> 14:55.311
YOU ALWAYS DO.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.813
{\an1}WHAT?
A GOOD-BYE EDITORIAL?

14:57.896 --> 14:59.148
NO.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.942
IT'S
A GOOD-BYE DINNER.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.277
JUST...

15:03.360 --> 15:05.321
JUST YOU AND ME.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.239
ANYTIME.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.241
GREAT.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.326
UH...

15:10.409 --> 15:11.785
HOW ABOUT, UH...

15:11.869 --> 15:13.829
HOW ABOUT
TOMORROW?

15:13.912 --> 15:16.332
SURE.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.336
ANDREA ZUCKERMAN
ASKED YOU ON A DATE?

15:20.419 --> 15:24.006
IT'S A FAREWELL DINNER,
LIKE A BUSINESS THING.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.008
HONEY, DO YOU
HAVE EVERYTHING?

15:26.091 --> 15:27.801
THEY HAVE STORES
IN MINNEAPOLIS.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.679
YOU BETTER REMEMBER
TO TAKE YOUR GALOSHES.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.850
{\an5}DID YOU TELL HIM
ABOUT ME STAYING
WITH KELLY?

15:34.933 --> 15:35.684
YES, SHE DID.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.188
{\an1}I DON'T THINK THE FAMILY
SHOULD SPLIT UP.

15:39.271 --> 15:42.441
LOOK WHO'S
STARTING IT.

15:42.733 --> 15:43.859
REMEMBER
BART JENSEN?

15:43.942 --> 15:46.362
{\an5}HE STAYED
WITH FRIENDS
IN MINNEAPOLIS

15:46.445 --> 15:48.864
WHEN HIS FAMILY
MOVED TO CHICAGO.

15:48.947 --> 15:52.701
{\an1}I BET BART'S DAD
NEVER OFFERED HIM A CAR.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.370
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
DAD?

15:54.453 --> 15:56.830
{\an1}THE COMPANY'S
SWEETENING THE DEAL

15:56.914 --> 15:58.332
WITH A NEW CAR.

15:58.415 --> 16:01.377
MY CAR GOES TO YOU...

16:01.460 --> 16:02.670
AND BRENDA.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.546
IF SHE GETS
HER LICENSE.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.341
THAT'S MY LIMO.

16:07.424 --> 16:08.175
LIMO?

16:08.258 --> 16:10.761
I'M IN THE BIG TIME.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.099
HI. I'LL BE
RIGHT THERE.

16:15.182 --> 16:18.394
I DON'T LIKE
SPLITTING US UP.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.895
I'LL BE BACK SOON.

16:19.978 --> 16:23.732
{\an4}WE'LL GET A HOUSE
WITH A HUGE
VEGETABLE GARDEN.

16:23.816 --> 16:28.195
{\an5}IN THE WINTER,
WE'LL HAVE
AN OUTDOOR FREEZER.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.198
I GOT TO RUN.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.200
{\an1}TAKE CARE
OF YOUR BROTHER.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.411
{\an4}TAKE CARE
OF YOUR SISTER.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.454
SEE YOU, BIG GUY.

16:37.538 --> 16:38.914
I'LL MISS YOU.

16:38.997 --> 16:40.416
LOVE YOU, DAD.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.501
{\an1}BYE-BYE.

16:49.633 --> 16:50.551
STEVE!

16:50.634 --> 16:51.760
HEY, STEVE!

16:51.844 --> 16:53.554
HOW'S THE EYE, MAN?

16:53.637 --> 16:55.639
IT'S NOT
YOUR PROBLEM, DUDE.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.558
{\an1}SO WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

16:57.641 --> 16:59.476
I'M GOING TO CLASS,
BRANDON,

16:59.560 --> 17:03.522
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU.

17:07.108 --> 17:10.069
{\an1}THE THOUGHT OF YOU LEAVING
WIPED ME OUT.

17:10.154 --> 17:13.449
{\an1}I REALIZED HOW MUCH
I'D MISS YOU.

17:13.531 --> 17:14.450
ME, TOO.

17:14.532 --> 17:17.368
THERE'S SO MUCH
WE HAVEN'T DONE.

17:17.453 --> 17:21.790
I THOUGHT WE'VE
DONE EVERYTHING.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.959
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

17:24.041 --> 17:24.917
I MEAN, LIKE,

17:25.002 --> 17:28.589
{\an1}I HAVEN'T TAKEN YOU
TO MY FAVORITE SURF SHOP.

17:28.672 --> 17:31.300
GOING TO A SURF SHOP
TOGETHER

17:31.383 --> 17:32.968
IS PRETTY SERIOUS
STUFF.

17:33.051 --> 17:36.805
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO TAKE THAT STEP?

17:36.889 --> 17:39.349
I THINK SO.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.684
SORRY
TO INTERRUPT.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.478
IT'S OK.
WHAT'S WRONG?

17:42.561 --> 17:47.483
I'M SORRY. MY MOM SAYS
YOU CAN'T STAY WITH US.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.821
KELLY REALLY TRIED.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.407
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:55.491 --> 17:59.703
{\an5}MY MOM SAYS
SHE'S STILL READJUSTING
TO SOBER LIFE.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.330
HER A.A. SPONSOR
THINKS

18:01.413 --> 18:04.958
{\an5}A HOUSE GUEST
WOULD BE TOO MUCH
PRESSURE.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.628
I FEEL REALLY BADLY
ABOUT THIS.

18:07.711 --> 18:10.339
IT'S OK.
SO DO I.

18:10.422 --> 18:11.673
STILL FRIENDS?

18:11.757 --> 18:14.510
FOR SURE.

18:15.761 --> 18:19.848
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW?

18:19.932 --> 18:22.226
DAMN!

18:31.777 --> 18:32.903
I'M SORRY, HONEY,

18:32.986 --> 18:36.156
BUT KELLY'S MOM
DOES HAVE A POINT.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.866
THAT'S WHAT
DYLAN SAID.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.411
YOU'RE GOING TO
MISS HIM, AREN'T YOU?

18:41.495 --> 18:42.246
YEAH, I AM.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.706
{\an1}WE'VE BEEN GETTING ALONG
GREAT LATELY.

18:44.790 --> 18:48.710
SO HAVE A LITTLE FAITH
IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

18:48.794 --> 18:52.005
{\an1}I CAN'T ASK A GUY
LIKE HIM

18:52.089 --> 18:53.549
TO WAIT FOR ME.

18:53.632 --> 18:57.719
{\an4}ALL THE GIRLS
AT WEST BEVERLY
WANT HIM.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.555
HEY, GUYS.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.349
COOKING FOR 4O?

19:02.432 --> 19:04.393
I GUESS
I OVERDID IT,

19:04.476 --> 19:06.186
BUT I COULDN'T RESIST

19:06.270 --> 19:07.896
DIGGING INTO
THIS CALIFORNIA FRUIT.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.900
{\an1}I INVITED KELLY, BUT SHE'S
GOING OUT WITH DONNA.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.153
{\an1}THEY'RE MAKING
PLANS WITHOUT ME.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.113
THEIR LIFE
GOES ON, TOO.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.699
{\an1}I'M THINKING
WE'VE OVERSTAYED OUR WELCOME.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.742
{\an1}STEVE'S BEEN
DISSING ME, TOO.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.704
MAYBE YOU'RE BEING
TOO SENSITIVE.

19:23.787 --> 19:24.913
I GOT TO GO.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.666
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

19:29.001 --> 19:32.296
TO GIVE UP A FRIEND.

19:39.636 --> 19:42.764
COMING TO THE PIER
WAS A GREAT IDEA.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.600
{\an1}I COULDN'T
LET YOU LEAVE

19:44.683 --> 19:46.643
{\an1}WITHOUT SEEING
MY FAVORITE PLACE.

19:46.727 --> 19:49.396
I DIDN'T LIVE HERE
LONG ENOUGH

19:49.479 --> 19:51.565
TO HAVE
A FAVORITE PLACE.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.609
WANT TO MAKE A WISH?

19:53.692 --> 19:55.694
SURE.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.280
{\an1}I THINK I'VE
DONE THIS BEFORE.

19:58.363 --> 20:02.117
{\an1}YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER IT
FROM THE MOVIE <i> BIG.</i>

20:02.201 --> 20:03.619
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.246
{\an1}YOU KNOW,
YOU USUALLY ARE RIGHT.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.832
{\an1}IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME
MUCH ANYMORE.

20:08.916 --> 20:12.336
YOU'LL EVEN MISS IT,
WON'T YOU?

20:12.753 --> 20:13.462
I REALLY WILL.

20:13.545 --> 20:17.007
YOU WISH YOU COULD
STAY, DON'T YOU?

20:17.090 --> 20:18.634
YEAH, I DO,

20:18.717 --> 20:22.471
BUT MY DAD NEEDS
THIS OPPORTUNITY.

20:24.848 --> 20:25.766
WELL, UH...

20:25.849 --> 20:30.020
I'VE GOT A SURPRISE
FOR YOU.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.064
WHAT?

20:32.731 --> 20:36.652
FIRST WE GOT TO GET
IN THE SADDLE.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.196
COME ON.

20:41.031 --> 20:45.160
{\an1}THIS THING MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE I'M 5 YEARS OLD.

20:45.243 --> 20:48.747
IT'S ONE OF L.A.'S
HIDDEN TREASURES.

20:49.498 --> 20:52.751
{\an1}SO WHAT'S
THE BIG SURPRISE?

20:53.752 --> 20:54.795
HA HA!

20:54.878 --> 20:58.298
OH, GOD. THIS IS
MAKING ME SO NERVOUS.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.384
WHAT?

21:00.884 --> 21:02.177
UM...

21:02.260 --> 21:04.179
WELL, I, UH...

21:04.262 --> 21:07.808
I'VE GOT A GOING-AWAY
PRESENT FOR YOU.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.852
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

21:12.229 --> 21:14.773
UH, WELL, UM...

21:16.441 --> 21:18.443
TA DA!

21:19.444 --> 21:20.988
WHAT?

21:21.071 --> 21:23.490
{\an1}THE CAROUSEL?
THE HORSE? WHAT?

21:23.573 --> 21:25.826
NO. I'M...

21:25.909 --> 21:29.496
I'M GIVING YOU
THE PERSON ON MY HORSE,

21:29.579 --> 21:32.833
UH...
IF YOU'LL TAKE HER.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.919
WHAT?

21:36.003 --> 21:39.881
{\an5}LOOK, BRANDON.
WE MAY NEVER SEE
EACH OTHER AGAIN,

21:39.965 --> 21:42.884
AND I WANT
GOOD-BYE TO BE

21:42.968 --> 21:46.346
A MOMENT
WE BOTH REMEMBER.

22:05.365 --> 22:06.950
WHAT DID YOU
TELL HER?

22:07.034 --> 22:10.412
{\an1}I TOLD HER I WOULD
THINK ABOUT IT.

22:10.495 --> 22:11.663
THINK ABOUT IT?

22:11.747 --> 22:13.915
SHE'S NOT OFFERING
AN ASSIGNMENT.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.876
I KNOW THAT, BRENDA.

22:15.959 --> 22:19.755
DO YOU WANT
TO SLEEP WITH HER?

22:19.838 --> 22:21.673
{\an1}I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN...

22:21.757 --> 22:23.925
{\an1}I NEVER REALLY
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.846
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
BUT I RULED IT OUT

22:27.929 --> 22:29.639
BECAUSE OF OUR FRIENDSHIP.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.933
{\an1}ACTUALLY,
I THINK SHE'S PRETTY.

22:32.017 --> 22:32.768
I DO, TOO.

22:32.851 --> 22:35.896
I THINK YOU GUYS
MAKE A GREAT COUPLE.

22:35.979 --> 22:38.815
{\an1}THAT'S JUST IT.
WE WOULDN'T BE A COUPLE.

22:38.899 --> 22:42.110
{\an1}WE CAN DO ANYTHING,
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER

22:42.194 --> 22:44.029
{\an1}BECAUSE
WE'RE LEAVING ANYWAY.

22:44.112 --> 22:47.282
AND IF YOU TWO
ARE GREAT TOGETHER?

22:47.365 --> 22:48.950
I'LL HAVE A NICE MEMORY.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.953
WHAT GOOD ARE MEMORIES
GOING TO DO US

22:52.037 --> 22:54.790
WHEN WE'RE IN MINNESOTA
IN DECEMBER

22:54.873 --> 22:56.917
IN 8 FEET OF SNOW?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.753
KEEP YOU WARM AT NIGHT.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.756
YO, DYLAN!

23:03.090 --> 23:04.758
OH, GOD!

23:04.841 --> 23:05.842
BURY ME.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.636
{\an1}WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

23:07.719 --> 23:11.139
I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DEAL WITH DYLAN

23:11.223 --> 23:13.934
SINCE WE STARTED
SLEEPING TOGETHER.

23:14.017 --> 23:16.937
{\an1}YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH DYLAN?

23:17.896 --> 23:20.148
{\an1}GREAT! I OPEN UP
ABOUT ANDREA,

23:20.232 --> 23:23.110
{\an1}AND YOU'RE KEEPING ME
IN THE DARK

23:23.193 --> 23:24.986
{\an1}ABOUT SLEEPING
WITH DYLAN.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.823
IT'S ONLY GONE ON
THREE WEEKS.

23:27.906 --> 23:31.785
{\an1}I JUST HOPE
YOU'RE BEING CAREFUL.

23:31.868 --> 23:33.829
I'M TRYING.

23:42.629 --> 23:45.674
NO. THAT'S GOING TO
WORK OUT JUST FINE.

23:45.757 --> 23:48.552
{\an1}I HAVE ALL THE PAPERS
ON YOUR DESK,

23:48.635 --> 23:52.055
{\an1}AND YOUR OLD COFFEE CUP
IS ON YOUR DESK.

23:52.139 --> 23:53.890
THANKS, RUTH.
YOU LOOK WONDERFUL.

23:53.974 --> 23:57.853
{\an1}AND MR. RAYFIELD
ASKED IF HE COULD POP IN.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.354
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

23:59.437 --> 24:00.313
ABSOLUTELY.

24:00.397 --> 24:03.316
THANKS, RUTH.

24:06.945 --> 24:10.490
{\an1}WHO SAYS YOU CAN'T
GO HOME AGAIN?

24:10.574 --> 24:11.241
STEVE.

24:11.324 --> 24:11.992
CONGRATULATIONS,

24:12.075 --> 24:14.995
{\an1}NOT THAT YOU
DESERVE ANY OF THIS.

24:15.078 --> 24:17.205
I STILL
CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.123
GOING TO CALIFORNIA

24:18.206 --> 24:22.544
{\an1}HAD TO BE THE SAVVY
CAREER MOVE OF ALL TIME.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.171
YEAH, BUT IT'S HARD

24:24.254 --> 24:27.174
{\an5}HAVING YOUR LIFE
DISRUPTED TWICE
IN ONE YEAR.

24:27.257 --> 24:31.261
{\an5}A PERSON'S
COLD-WEATHER BLOOD
GETS THINNED OUT

24:31.344 --> 24:33.054
AFTER YOU
MISS A WINTER.

24:33.138 --> 24:37.058
HAVE YOU LOOKED
AT TODAY'S CALENDAR?

24:37.142 --> 24:38.226
NO.

24:38.310 --> 24:38.894
GOOD.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.729
I'VE MARKED DOWN
THE CHANGES.

24:40.812 --> 24:44.357
IT'S MR. FLETCHER
AT 9:OO,

24:44.441 --> 24:45.317
SUNDERSON AT 9:15.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.904
CONFERENCE CALL WITH THE BANK
IS NOW AT 9:3O.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.739
THE STAFF REPORTS ARE AT 1O:OO,

24:50.822 --> 24:55.076
BUT THEY WON'T CONFLICT
WITH THE BOARD MEETING AT 4:3O.

24:55.160 --> 24:59.206
OK? AND THE ENVELOPES
THAT ARE TAGGED PURPLE

24:59.289 --> 25:01.082
{\an1}NEED YOUR IMMEDIATE
ATTENTION.

25:01.166 --> 25:05.587
OH, AND HERE ARE THIS MORNING'S
PHONE MESSAGES.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.589
ALL OF THESE?

25:07.672 --> 25:08.924
YES.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.635
YOU'RE A POPULAR GUY.

25:14.804 --> 25:16.556
I MUST BE HALLUCINATING--

25:16.640 --> 25:19.809
{\an1}BRANDON WALSH,
BACK AT THE BEACH?

25:19.893 --> 25:23.396
I JUST CAME DOWN
TO TALK TO BRENDA.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.273
{\an5}WE TOOK THE SCENIC ROUTE.

25:25.357 --> 25:29.653
{\an1}LISTEN, B., DO YOU MIND
IF BRENDA AND I TALK?

25:29.736 --> 25:32.822
BE BACK
IN A MINUTE.

25:37.035 --> 25:39.454
{\an1}LISTEN,
I'VE BEEN THINKING...

25:39.537 --> 25:40.747
SO HAVE I.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.958
{\an5}LONG-DISTANCE
RELATIONSHIPS
SCARE ME.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.794
I SAW WHAT IT
DID TO BRANDON.

25:45.877 --> 25:48.505
THAT WAS DIFFERENT.
CHERYL HAD PROBLEMS.

25:48.588 --> 25:51.675
{\an1}ABSENCE CAN MAKE
THE HEART GROW FONDER.

25:51.758 --> 25:53.593
WHAT ABOUT
ROAMING EYES?

25:53.677 --> 25:55.804
{\an1}KNOW WHAT
I WAS THINKING?

25:55.887 --> 25:56.763
WHAT?

25:56.846 --> 25:58.807
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.517
REALLY?

26:00.600 --> 26:02.310
ME, TOO.

26:02.394 --> 26:08.692
{\an5}YOU KNOW, I WAS
MAYBE GOING TO BE
IN <i> ROMEO AND JULIET.</i>

26:08.775 --> 26:11.152
NOW I'M SORT OF
LIVING IT.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.697
{\an1}"PARTING IS SUCH
SWEET SORROW," HUH?

26:13.780 --> 26:16.783
{\an1}WE COULD ALWAYS
RUN AWAY.

26:16.866 --> 26:19.536
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

26:19.619 --> 26:23.081
I DON'T KNOW.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.060
HI.

26:45.061 --> 26:45.854
UH, HI.

26:45.937 --> 26:51.985
LISTEN, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT YOUR PRESENT,

26:52.068 --> 26:52.694
AND--

26:52.777 --> 26:53.903
ME, TOO. UH...

26:54.612 --> 26:58.742
{\an1}MAYBE I WAS BEING
A LITTLE IMPULSIVE.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.037
OK...

27:02.120 --> 27:03.413
SEE YOU.

27:03.496 --> 27:05.707
SEE YOU.

27:07.167 --> 27:10.170
I WANT YOU
TO BE IMPULSIVE.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.338
YOU DO?

27:11.421 --> 27:14.174
I CAME TO ACCEPT
YOUR GIFT

27:14.257 --> 27:17.010
WITH PLEASURE.

27:22.432 --> 27:23.516
OK. GOOD.

27:23.600 --> 27:26.394
WE GOT THAT
OUT OF THE WAY.

27:26.478 --> 27:31.107
GOOD. NOW WE CAN
DIGEST OUR FOOD.

27:32.150 --> 27:35.945
{\an1}LIKE WOODY ALLEN SAID
IN THE MOVIE <i> ANNIE HALL.</i>

27:36.029 --> 27:39.199
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE A MOVIE BUFF.

27:39.282 --> 27:44.412
{\an1}OH, THERE'S A LOT
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME.

27:44.496 --> 27:47.374
BUT I'LL SOON
FIND OUT.

27:47.457 --> 27:50.126
SOON.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.753
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

27:51.836 --> 27:54.881
WHY DON'T YOU
MEET ME AT WORK,

27:54.964 --> 27:57.926
AND WE'LL
GO FROM THERE?

28:06.309 --> 28:08.895
TONIGHT.

28:17.904 --> 28:20.156
{\an1}THEN WE WENT
TO FARMER'S MARKET

28:20.240 --> 28:22.617
{\an1}AND PICKED UP
SOME FRESH SHRIMP.

28:22.700 --> 28:28.123
I HAD TO CANCEL DINNER
WITH MITCH AND PAULA.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.417
THEY WERE DYING TO SEE YOU.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.920
{\an1}YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
HOW CRAZY THINGS ARE HERE.

28:34.003 --> 28:35.463
WITH ALL THE STREAMLINING,

28:35.547 --> 28:38.133
{\an1}I'M DOING THE WORK
OF THREE SENIOR STAFFERS.

28:38.216 --> 28:41.970
THEY'RE GETTING A BARGAIN,
AND WE'RE GETTING GYPPED.

28:42.053 --> 28:45.181
HONEY, FIRST DAYS
ARE THE HARDEST DAYS.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.143
I NEED YOU
TO BE SUPPORTIVE.

28:48.226 --> 28:49.185
I'M JUST SCARED.

28:49.269 --> 28:53.648
{\an1}I MEAN, YOU DON'T HAVE TIME
TO SEE OUR BEST FRIENDS.

28:53.731 --> 28:56.651
{\an1}MAYBE YOU WON'T
HAVE TIME FOR US.

28:56.734 --> 29:00.196
HAVE THE KIDS
GOTTEN OVER THE SHOCK?

29:00.280 --> 29:01.114
YOU TELL ME.

29:01.197 --> 29:03.324
BRENDA'S QUOTING
<i>ROMEO AND JULIET,</i>

29:03.408 --> 29:05.368
AND BRANDON
CHANGED THREE TIMES

29:05.452 --> 29:07.829
BEFORE
GOING TO WORK.

29:07.912 --> 29:11.166
WELL, I MISS YOU.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.209
BYE.

29:21.509 --> 29:23.553
HERE YOU GO.

29:23.636 --> 29:25.221
HI.

29:28.391 --> 29:34.063
{\an1}LISTEN, I FORGOT TONIGHT
IS MY MOM'S SISTER'S BIRTHDAY.

29:34.147 --> 29:35.190
OH...

29:35.273 --> 29:37.567
WELL, HOW ABOUT
TOMORROW NIGHT?

29:37.650 --> 29:40.195
WELL, LET ME SEE.

29:40.278 --> 29:41.821
{\an1}UH...

29:41.905 --> 29:46.367
{\an1}I HAVE THAT INTERSCHOOL
EDITORIAL CONFERENCE.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.369
SOUNDS HOT.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.913
YEAH, RIGHT!

29:49.996 --> 29:51.414
HOW ABOUT SUNDAY?

29:51.498 --> 29:55.418
UH, I--I AM FREE...

29:55.502 --> 29:56.711
GREAT.

29:56.794 --> 29:58.213
BUT MY HOUSE ISN'T.

29:58.296 --> 30:02.383
{\an1}THAT'S THE NIGHT
MY DAD HAS POKER NIGHT.

30:04.427 --> 30:07.263
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.892
DO YOU SEE THIS KEY?

30:10.975 --> 30:13.394
IT'S THE KEY
TO HAPPINESS.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.230
THIS IS THE KEY

30:15.313 --> 30:18.566
THAT OPENS THE DOOR
TO THE PEACH PIT

30:18.650 --> 30:19.609
ON SUNDAY

30:19.692 --> 30:23.530
WHEN IT'S CLOSED
TO EVERYBODY ELSE.

30:23.613 --> 30:27.408
{\an1}HA HA HA!
OH, MY GOD.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.244
LIKE THE MOVIE

30:29.327 --> 30:31.621
{\an1}<i>THE POSTMAN</i>
<i>ALWAYS RINGS TWICE.</i>

30:31.704 --> 30:35.416
THEY DO IT ON THE COUNTER.

30:35.500 --> 30:39.087
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
RENT THAT MOVIE.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.881
SWEET DREAMS.

30:49.305 --> 30:50.306
STEVE-O!

30:50.390 --> 30:52.308
ARE YOU STILL HERE?

30:52.392 --> 30:54.269
I'LL MISS YOU,
TOO, BUDDY.

30:54.352 --> 30:57.897
I THINK MINNESOTA GIRLS
WILL WAIT FOR ANYBODY,

30:57.981 --> 30:58.940
{\an1}EVEN YOU.

30:59.023 --> 31:01.943
{\an5}LIKE KELLY
WILL WAIT
FOR YOU?

31:02.026 --> 31:03.486
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

31:03.570 --> 31:04.445
NOTHING.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.155
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.991
WHAT'S
YOUR PROBLEM?

31:08.074 --> 31:09.325
YOU'RE MY PROBLEM.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.286
{\an1}YOU'RE GETTING
IN MY FACE.

31:11.369 --> 31:14.330
{\an1}I'M BEGINNING
TO HATE THIS DUMP.

31:14.414 --> 31:17.375
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HIM?

31:22.380 --> 31:26.050
{\an5}BRENDA, WE ARE
SO GOOD TOGETHER.

31:27.844 --> 31:31.723
{\an1}WHAT WE HAVE TO DO
IS TALK...

31:32.724 --> 31:36.185
{\an1}AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO
IS BREAK UP.

31:36.269 --> 31:39.314
THAT'S WHAT I CAME
HERE TO TELL YOU.

31:39.397 --> 31:42.025
SO ALL THIS
WAS JUST A LEAD-IN?

31:42.108 --> 31:47.280
{\an4}NO. I WANTED
TO BE WITH YOU
ONE LAST TIME.

31:47.363 --> 31:50.241
I THOUGHT WE AGREED
AT THE BEACH.

31:50.325 --> 31:53.661
{\an1}WELL, I THOUGHT
ABOUT IT SOME MORE.

31:53.745 --> 31:54.662
BREN...

31:54.746 --> 31:58.499
{\an1}DYLAN, I JUST
HAVE TO DO THIS NOW.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.753
DON'T DO THIS.

32:03.713 --> 32:05.715
I'M SORRY.

32:15.725 --> 32:19.312
{\an1}IT'S BEEN 36 HOURS,
AND I MISS HIM.

32:19.395 --> 32:23.191
{\an5}LISTEN, FUNDAMENTAL
BREAKUP SURVIVAL
TACTIC NUMBER ONE--

32:23.274 --> 32:24.651
KEEP BUSY.

32:24.734 --> 32:27.195
DO YOU WANT TO COME OVER?

32:27.278 --> 32:29.322
I PROMISED
TO HELP PACK.

32:29.405 --> 32:31.366
MMM, SOUNDS
KIND OF DEPRESSING.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.743
I'M KIND OF
OUT OF COMMISSION.

32:33.826 --> 32:36.913
SO MAYBE I'LL
SEE YOU TONIGHT?

32:36.996 --> 32:39.040
OK. BYE.

32:40.333 --> 32:44.504
GOOD MORNING, CHAMP.
ARE YOU STILL UPSET?

32:45.963 --> 32:48.966
{\an1}YEAH. ME, TOO.
IT'S STEVE.

32:49.050 --> 32:52.387
{\an1}HE'S NEVER ACTED
LIKE THIS MUCH OF A JERK.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.347
REMEMBER
BEFORE WE MOVED HERE,

32:54.430 --> 32:58.267
MARJORIE AND SARAH
FROZE ME OUT?

32:58.351 --> 33:01.104
{\an1}YEAH. THEY STOPPED
COMING OVER AND STUFF.

33:01.187 --> 33:04.065
THEY WERE MAD AT ME
FOR LEAVING THEM.

33:04.148 --> 33:08.236
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH STEVE.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.696
YEAH...

33:09.779 --> 33:10.571
MAYBE.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.825
I'M GOING TO FIND OUT.

33:17.495 --> 33:19.414
ALL RIGHT.
YOU KIDNAP ME,

33:19.497 --> 33:22.250
{\an1}DRAG ME OUT HERE,
RUIN MY SUNDAY.

33:22.333 --> 33:25.753
{\an5}STEVE,
I KNOW WHY YOU'RE
ACTING LIKE THIS.

33:25.837 --> 33:26.963
NO, YOU DON'T!

33:27.046 --> 33:28.881
I'M ANGRY
ABOUT GOING, TOO.

33:28.965 --> 33:31.467
{\an1}NO. YOU MAKE FRIENDS
IN YOUR SLEEP.

33:31.551 --> 33:36.723
{\an4}I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
BETTER THAN TO MAKE
A FOOL OF MYSELF.

33:36.806 --> 33:40.393
{\an1}I EVEN TOLD YOU
WHY I FOUGHT THAT MIDGET.

33:40.476 --> 33:43.563
STEVE, YOU THINK
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON

33:43.646 --> 33:45.273
WHO'S FELT LIKE A FOOL?

33:45.356 --> 33:49.318
{\an5}YOU KNOW WHY
I BROUGHT YOU
TO THE BEACH?

33:49.402 --> 33:51.320
SEE THAT WATER?

33:51.404 --> 33:52.947
I'M NOT BLIND.

33:53.030 --> 33:55.283
LAST SUMMER,
ALL I DREAMED ABOUT

33:55.366 --> 33:58.411
WAS MOVING TO CALIFORNIA
AND BECOMING MR. SURF.

33:58.494 --> 34:00.955
I GOT POUNDED
BY THE WAVES.

34:01.038 --> 34:03.124
{\an1}EVERYBODY WIPES OUT.
BIG DEAL.

34:03.207 --> 34:05.960
IT WAS A BIG DEAL
TO ME.

34:06.043 --> 34:08.963
IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE
I DIDN'T BELONG.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.841
I HAVEN'T BEEN BACK
SINCE SEPTEMBER,

34:11.924 --> 34:13.342
BUT I FIGURED,

34:13.426 --> 34:17.472
{\an5}"WHO BETTER
TO SHARE MY LAST
WIPEOUT WITH?"

34:24.562 --> 34:27.106
{\an1}I'M GOING TO
MISS YOU, MAN.

34:27.190 --> 34:31.735
I'M GOING TO MISS
YOU, TOO, BUDDY.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.953
HONEY, IF YOU
KEEP STARING

34:41.036 --> 34:44.123
AT THAT PICTURE
OF YOU AND DYLAN,

34:44.206 --> 34:45.833
YOU'LL HYPNOTIZE
YOURSELF.

34:45.917 --> 34:46.958
I FEEL AWFUL.

34:47.043 --> 34:50.463
I WISH YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

34:50.545 --> 34:52.507
OH, WELL,
NO MORE HIBERNATING

34:52.590 --> 34:55.635
FOR THE THERMAL
UNDERWEAR.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.971
{\an1}I MIGHT AS WELL
BURY THIS.

34:59.055 --> 35:01.849
THE SUN DOES SHINE
IN MINNEAPOLIS.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.727
YOUR LIFE WILL
SHINE AGAIN, TOO.

35:04.811 --> 35:05.520
I PROMISE.

35:05.603 --> 35:09.398
{\an1}I'M JUST SO MAD AT DAD
FOR ALL THIS.

35:09.482 --> 35:12.527
{\an1}HIS JOB KEEPS ON
RUINING OUR LIVES.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.862
OH, BABY, I KNOW.
IT'S HARD.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.532
{\an1}IT'S NOT LIKE
HE'S BEING FIRED.

35:17.615 --> 35:20.034
{\an1}HE'D STILL
HAVE A JOB HERE.

35:20.117 --> 35:21.661
WHEN YOU
HAVE A CAREER,

35:21.744 --> 35:25.123
{\an5}YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
HOW COMPLICATED
THINGS CAN BE.

35:25.206 --> 35:26.499
{\an5}[TELEPHONE RINGS]

35:26.582 --> 35:29.418
IF IT'S DYLAN,
I'M NOT HERE.

35:29.502 --> 35:33.047
{\an1}NO, I AM.
NO, I'M NOT.

35:33.130 --> 35:34.257
HELLO.

35:34.340 --> 35:35.383
OH, HI, JIM.

35:35.466 --> 35:38.553
I ONLY HAVE A SECOND.
I'M SWAMPED.

35:38.636 --> 35:39.679
YOU SOUND
HASSLED.

35:39.762 --> 35:42.598
I WAS HASSLED
WHEN I HAD A LIFE.

35:42.682 --> 35:46.227
SO I HAVE TO TAKE
A LATER FLIGHT.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.436
OH, WELL.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.563
BETTER LATE
THAN NEVER.

35:48.646 --> 35:50.231
YEAH.

35:52.483 --> 35:53.901
I MISS YOU GUYS.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.529
ME, TOO.
BYE, HONEY.

35:56.612 --> 35:57.947
BYE.

36:04.495 --> 36:05.538
ARE YOU OK?

36:05.621 --> 36:10.960
{\an5}I GUESS I HATE
THESE LONG-DISTANCE
RELATIONSHIPS, TOO.

36:17.258 --> 36:18.718
OVER HERE.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.112
UHH...

36:38.195 --> 36:42.533
SO WHAT TOOK YOU
SO LONG?

36:47.538 --> 36:49.123
STEVE?

36:49.540 --> 36:52.960
DUDE, YOU'VE BEEN
SNORING ALL DAY.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.713
THE SUN MUST
HAVE ZONED ME.

36:55.796 --> 36:57.673
{\an1}DON'T YOU
HAVE A DATE?

36:57.757 --> 36:59.926
GOD!
WE'VE GOT TO JAM.

37:00.009 --> 37:00.843
WHO'S IT WITH?

37:00.927 --> 37:04.513
ONE CONFESSION PER DAY
IS ALL YOU GET, BUDDY.

37:04.597 --> 37:07.850
HONEY, YOU'RE
HOME EARLY!

37:07.934 --> 37:09.143
OH, I COMPROMISED.

37:09.226 --> 37:14.065
{\an1}I WORKED ON THE PLANE
AND BROUGHT HOME A STACK.

37:14.148 --> 37:15.316
HI, DAD.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.568
HEY, SWEETHEART.

37:18.235 --> 37:20.571
{\an5}[TELEPHONE RINGS]

37:22.239 --> 37:23.866
HELLO.
OH, HI, NAT.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.993
UH, YEAH. HOLD ON.

37:26.077 --> 37:30.790
{\an5}BRENDA, NAT'S GOT
A PRIVATE ROAST
AT THE PEACH PIT.

37:30.873 --> 37:32.083
CAN YOU HELP?

37:32.166 --> 37:36.045
{\an1}I'M REALLY NOT
FEELING VERY SOCIABLE.

37:37.213 --> 37:40.341
BRENDA,
NAT NEEDS YOU.

37:40.424 --> 37:41.717
OK.

37:41.801 --> 37:44.303
SHE'LL
BE RIGHT THERE.

37:44.387 --> 37:45.012
HI.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.305
SORRY I'M LATE.

37:46.389 --> 37:49.684
{\an1}THAT'S OK.
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

37:49.767 --> 37:51.519
NO. I WAS
JUST IMAGINING

37:51.602 --> 37:54.063
{\an5}SOMETHING
A LITTLE
DIFFERENT.

37:54.146 --> 37:55.564
FORGET IT.

37:55.648 --> 37:56.232
{\an5}[AHEM]

37:56.315 --> 37:58.526
LISTEN, MAYBE
THE PEACH PIT

37:58.609 --> 38:00.403
ISN'T
THE RIGHT PLACE.

38:00.486 --> 38:04.657
{\an1}BRANDON,
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

38:04.740 --> 38:07.076
I JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE

38:07.159 --> 38:09.453
YOU'RE SURE
ABOUT THIS.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.205
I GUESS SO.

38:11.288 --> 38:13.624
FINE. ME, TOO.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.210
{\an1}BRANDON,
WAIT A MINUTE.

38:16.293 --> 38:19.213
BEFORE WE GO IN, UM--

38:32.685 --> 38:34.228
WOW.

38:35.354 --> 38:38.649
WE'LL JUST, UH...

38:39.650 --> 38:40.985
{\an5}SURPRISE!

38:39.650 --> 38:40.985
{\an1}SURPRISE!

38:39.650 --> 38:40.985
SURPRISE!

38:41.068 --> 38:44.363
{\an5}WH-WHAT
ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

38:44.447 --> 38:45.197
WOO!

38:45.281 --> 38:47.241
CAN WE DO IT
AGAIN?

38:47.324 --> 38:48.909
I WASN'T
SET UP.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.953
YOU CAN'T RETAKE
A SURPRISE.

38:51.037 --> 38:53.748
Was this
all a setup?

38:53.831 --> 38:54.457
No.

38:54.540 --> 38:57.251
I went to Kelly
for, you know,

38:57.335 --> 38:58.919
{\an1}advice
on being together,

38:59.003 --> 39:02.757
{\an4}and she turned
our rendezvous
into this.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.717
BRENDA WILL
BE HERE SOON.

39:04.800 --> 39:09.597
Well, there's always
the after-party.

39:09.680 --> 39:10.431
SHH...

39:10.514 --> 39:11.932
SHUT THE DOOR.

39:12.016 --> 39:15.061
ALL RIGHT.
SHH...

{\an5}SURPRISE!

39:17.021 --> 39:19.440
SURPRISE!

39:17.021 --> 39:19.440
{\an1}SURPRISE!

39:19.523 --> 39:20.816
YOU GUYS...

39:20.900 --> 39:24.195
THIS IS WHAT
WE'VE BEEN DOING.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.822
YOU KNEW,
DIDN'T YOU?

39:26.906 --> 39:28.115
GUILTY AS CHARGED.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.785
{\an1}YOUR FRIENDS
REALLY DID IT UP.

39:30.868 --> 39:32.119
GENTLEMEN...

39:32.203 --> 39:36.123
{\an5}ANYBODY WHO WANTS
TO SAY GOOD-BYE
ON CAMERA,

39:36.207 --> 39:38.250
DAVID WILL BE
IN THE CORNER.

39:38.334 --> 39:43.005
THE HAMBURGERS ARE ON.
I CAN'T RESIST HOGGING A CAMERA.

39:43.089 --> 39:47.176
BRENDA, BRANDON,
I LOVE YOU.

39:47.259 --> 39:48.677
I'LL MISS YOU.

39:48.761 --> 39:51.597
WHO WILL DO
MY DIRTY WORK?

39:51.680 --> 39:54.016
HA HA HA!

39:57.228 --> 39:59.605
UM, BRENDA,

39:59.688 --> 40:01.440
I'D EVEN LET YOU

40:01.524 --> 40:06.070
SHARE MY CLOTHES
IF IT MEANT YOU'D STAY.

40:08.572 --> 40:09.990
OK...

40:10.074 --> 40:11.992
DO I LOOK OK?

40:12.076 --> 40:13.119
UM, OK, BRENDA,

40:13.202 --> 40:17.998
I JUST WANTED TO SAY HOW COOL
OUR FRIENDSHIP HAS BEEN.

40:18.082 --> 40:22.128
{\an1}YOUR FAMILY WAS THERE
WHEN MOM HAD A BAD TIME.

40:22.211 --> 40:24.130
I'VE BECOME
LESS OF A BITCH

40:24.213 --> 40:25.464
SINCE WE STARTED
HANGING OUT.

40:25.548 --> 40:29.176
THERE REALLY WAS ONLY
ONE WAY YOU COULD GO.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.178
{\an1}WITHOUT BRANDON,
I'D PROBABLY

40:31.262 --> 40:34.223
BE HANGING OUT
DRINKING BEERS

40:34.306 --> 40:35.891
WITH AIRHEADS

40:35.975 --> 40:38.477
AND GETTING BEAT UP.

40:39.645 --> 40:41.063
UH...

40:41.147 --> 40:42.231
THANKS, BRANDON,

40:42.314 --> 40:46.777
FOR MAKING ME
THE GREAT GUY I AM.

40:47.945 --> 40:48.946
HA HA!

40:51.615 --> 40:54.535
{\an1}UM, WHEN BRANDON
FIRST SHOWED

40:54.618 --> 40:56.370
AT WEST BEVERLY,

40:56.453 --> 40:59.832
I FIGURED HE WAS
SOME CUTE, CONCEITED GUY

40:59.915 --> 41:02.001
TRYING TO TAKE
SOME SHORTCUTS.

41:02.084 --> 41:05.129
{\an1}WELL, HE TAUGHT ME
A SHORTCUT--

41:05.212 --> 41:09.884
THAT I COULD BE MORE OPEN...

41:10.968 --> 41:12.344
SOMETIMES.

41:12.428 --> 41:13.429
{\an5}[AHEM]

41:13.512 --> 41:18.225
{\an1}HE LIKED ME, SO I THOUGHT
MAYBE THE OTHERS WOULD, TOO,

41:18.309 --> 41:22.229
INCLUDING
HIS SISTER BRENDA.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.899
UM...

41:25.816 --> 41:30.696
MINNESOTA DOESN'T KNOW
HOW LUCKY IT IS, ACE.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.836
I DON'T DO CAMERAS.

41:48.964 --> 41:52.259
WELL, SLIM, WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT TOGETHER.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.178
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

41:54.261 --> 41:59.558
{\an1}THAT EVER HIT ME
AND LIVED TO TELL ABOUT IT.

42:00.851 --> 42:03.270
{\an1}YOU INVITED ME
INTO YOUR FAMILY,

42:03.354 --> 42:06.565
AND I TOOK OUT
YOUR SISTER--

42:06.649 --> 42:08.442
BRENDA...

42:08.692 --> 42:13.739
WHO SAVED ME
FROM GOING BACK TO DRINKING.

42:15.032 --> 42:17.284
SHE SAVED ME
FROM MYSELF.

42:17.368 --> 42:20.454
{\an1}I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO

42:20.538 --> 42:21.789
WITHOUT YOU GUYS.

42:21.872 --> 42:24.416
AT THE RISK
OF SOUNDING MUSHY,

42:24.500 --> 42:31.006
YOU WALSH PEOPLE
ARE THE ONLY FAMILY I'VE GOT.

42:44.561 --> 42:47.147
I GUESS I SHOULD
SAY SOMETHING.

42:47.231 --> 42:52.361
{\an1}SPEAKING FOR US
WALSH PEOPLE,

42:52.444 --> 42:54.822
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL

42:54.905 --> 42:58.325
FOR LETTING US BECOME
A PART OF YOUR WORLD.

42:58.409 --> 43:04.164
{\an1}IT KIND OF SNEAKS UP
ON YOU HERE, YOU KNOW.

43:04.248 --> 43:08.585
IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

43:08.669 --> 43:12.047
YOU KNOW...

43:12.715 --> 43:18.345
YOU'VE MADE ME REALIZE
THAT HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS,

43:18.429 --> 43:23.392
NOT WHERE THE HIGHEST
PAYCHECK IS...

43:25.436 --> 43:28.397
SO I'VE DECIDED
THAT MY FAMILY AND I--

43:28.480 --> 43:32.609
WE'RE GOING TO STAY HERE...

43:34.445 --> 43:37.489
{\an1}AND KEEP
OUR WONDERFUL LIFE.

43:37.573 --> 43:39.158

IT'S UGLY HEAD.

43:53.756 --> 43:55.716
CAN WE SQUASH IT?

43:55.799 --> 43:56.717
I DON'T KNOW.

43:56.800 --> 44:00.888
{\an1}THERE'S A LOT TO BE SAID
ABOUT OUR FRIENDSHIP.

44:00.971 --> 44:02.556
YEAH.

44:03.682 --> 44:07.686
SO WOULD YOU HAVE REALLY
GONE THROUGH WITH IT?

44:07.770 --> 44:09.396
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.

44:09.480 --> 44:12.566
WELL, ONE THING
I DO KNOW...

44:12.649 --> 44:13.067

44:13.150 --> 44:15.778
YOU'RE A GREAT KISSER.

44:15.861 --> 44:19.406

TELL ME WE WERE
STAYING?

44:19.490 --> 44:21.075

DOESN'T KNOW

HIS OFFER?

44:25.287 --> 44:27.414
WON'T HE
BE FURIOUS?

44:27.498 --> 44:30.584

HE'LL FIRE YOU?

{\an1}SO EVERYTHING'S GOING TO
BE GREAT AGAIN, RIGHT?

44:45.474 --> 44:46.558
DYLAN, I'M LATE.

44:46.642 --> 44:49.103
WHAT ARE YOU
LATE FOR?

44:49.186 --> 44:53.607
{\an1}NO. YOU KNOW,
I'M LATE.
