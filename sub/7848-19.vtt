I ASSUME
THIS WAS THE RUCKUS

20:31.100 --> 20:32.000
TO WHICH
YOU WERE REFERRING?

20:32.000 --> 20:36.567
HE PLAYED A REALLY MEAN
PRACTICAL JOKE ON ME, MOMMY.

20:36.567 --> 20:37.600
[WHISPERS] Yes.

20:37.600 --> 20:41.133
CODY,
TELL YOUR BROTHER
YOU'RE SORRY.

20:41.133 --> 20:41.700
SHAME ON YOU.

20:41.700 --> 20:44.367
SORRY, ZACH.
YOU'RE SUCH A CHICKEN.

20:44.367 --> 20:47.300
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GOT SCARED
OVER A LITTLE GHOST.

20:47.300 --> 20:48.500
THIS HOTEL
HAS A GHOST?

20:48.500 --> 20:50.300
Mr. Moseby,
high-pitched voice:
OF COURSE NOT.

20:50.300 --> 20:52.233
NOW TELL THE NICE LADY

20:52.233 --> 20:53.867
YOU WERE JUST PRETENDING.

20:53.867 --> 20:55.100
YEAH.
THERE IS NO GHOST.

20:55.100 --> 20:58.800
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE
WOULD PAY EXTRA

20:58.800 --> 21:00.100
TO STAY IN
A HAUNTED ROOM.

21:00.100 --> 21:03.400
OH, HE MEANT
NO GHOST IN THE HALLWAY.

21:03.667 --> 21:06.100
HOWEVER, THE ROOM
IS LOUSY WITH GHOSTS.

21:06.100 --> 21:09.233
THE REST OF THE HOTEL
IS HAUNTED BY THESE TWO.

21:09.233 --> 21:10.834
BOO!
BOO!

21:11.834 --> 21:14.500
THAT'LL BE A BUCK.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.667
DID YOU REALLY
LEAVE YOUR BLANKIE HERE,

21:24.667 --> 21:26.934
OR IS THIS JUST
ANOTHER STUPID PRANK?

21:26.934 --> 21:30.300
LISTEN, I DON'T KID
WHEN IT COMES TO BLANKIE.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.967
NOW HELP ME
LOOK AROUND...

21:32.967 --> 21:35.767
UNLESS
YOU'RE TOO SCARED.

21:37.667 --> 21:40.467
[THUNDER]

21:40.467 --> 21:43.000
EXCUSE ME.
IS THIS YOURS?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.200
YEAH, THANKS.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.700
DON'T MENTION IT.

21:52.767 --> 21:56.667
AAH!
AAH!

21:56.667 --> 21:59.400
AAH!
