34:04.085 --> 34:07.349
Oh, hey, man.
That was... fast.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.005
Come on, brother.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.093
[panting]

34:12.137 --> 34:14.139
Find anything
down there?

34:15.401 --> 34:17.272
Whoa.

34:17.316 --> 34:18.752
Is that...?
Yeah.

34:18.795 --> 34:20.754
And there's a ton of it.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.843
Went down on a wreck
called the Roselita.

34:22.886 --> 34:25.541
This is Arabic.

34:25.585 --> 34:26.412
GREENE:
Magnum, what the hell?

34:26.455 --> 34:27.848
I already told you I'm not...

34:29.284 --> 34:31.547
I'm not asking you
to reveal anything.

34:31.591 --> 34:33.158
I'm asking you
to confirm.

34:33.201 --> 34:35.986
Were the guys who hired Nuzo
ever suspected of stealing gold

34:36.030 --> 34:37.292
while stationed in
Iraq, yes or no?

34:37.336 --> 34:38.772
Thomas...

34:38.815 --> 34:40.904
RICK: Captain, this is
about finding the men

34:40.948 --> 34:42.297
who killed one of our own.

34:42.341 --> 34:44.647
Appealing to my patriotic side
isn't gonna work.

34:44.691 --> 34:46.736
Then how about
your parental side?

34:46.780 --> 34:49.087
Remember who you called when
your boy had that little dustup

34:49.130 --> 34:50.610
in Kabul?Are you actually standing there

34:50.653 --> 34:52.612
in clown pants trying
to blackmail me, son?

34:52.655 --> 34:54.179
Absolutely.

34:54.222 --> 34:55.832
Sir.

34:57.878 --> 35:00.620
Okay.

35:00.663 --> 35:03.231
Yes.

35:03.275 --> 35:04.928
They were suspected
of trying to steal gold

35:04.972 --> 35:06.800
from one of Saddam's strongholds
in Tikrit,

35:06.843 --> 35:09.585
but there was never enough
evidence for a court-martial,

35:09.629 --> 35:11.935
not that it mattered because we
caught 'em doing other things.

35:11.979 --> 35:13.154
But not before they managed

35:13.198 --> 35:14.764
to get their gold
on a boat to Hawaii.

35:14.808 --> 35:16.679
Yeah, only it sinks,
which for them

35:16.723 --> 35:18.681
actually turned out
to be a good thing.

35:18.725 --> 35:20.770
Those guys do a stretch in
prison while their fortune sits

35:20.814 --> 35:22.729
at the bottom of the ocean
waiting for them.

35:22.772 --> 35:25.297
When they get out,
they hire Nuzo to find it.

35:25.340 --> 35:26.907
[phone vibrates]

35:26.950 --> 35:28.213
Tanaka.

35:28.256 --> 35:29.475
You find the wreck?

35:29.518 --> 35:31.738
Yeah. Right where you said.

35:31.781 --> 35:33.174
There's just one problem.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.133
What's that?TANAKA: The gold's gone.

35:35.176 --> 35:38.136
What do you mean "gone"?TANAKA: Gone,

35:38.179 --> 35:40.138
as in there's nothing
on that wreck except barnacles.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.835
Those guys must have
followed us out there.

35:41.878 --> 35:43.793
We were the only ones
with the coordinates.

35:43.837 --> 35:45.491
That's why they didn't kill me
when they had their chance.

35:45.534 --> 35:46.840
A boatload of gold bricks?

35:46.883 --> 35:48.450
You can bet
they're long gone by now.

35:48.494 --> 35:50.931
Only way you're gonna find those
guys is with a time machine.

35:50.974 --> 35:52.846
You got one of those, Magnum?

35:52.889 --> 35:54.978
No.

35:56.806 --> 35:58.808
But I know someone who does.

36:07.252 --> 36:08.688
Higgins.Ever hear of knocking?

36:08.731 --> 36:10.080
I need a favor.
[scoffs]

36:10.124 --> 36:12.082
The last favor got me shot.

36:12.126 --> 36:13.214
Eh, technically,
you offered to help.

36:13.258 --> 36:14.520
This is a favor.

36:14.563 --> 36:17.871
That is the worst apology
I have ever heard.

36:17.914 --> 36:21.962
I'm sorry you got shot.

36:22.005 --> 36:24.225
Really am.

36:24.704 --> 36:26.662
Okay. What is it?

36:26.706 --> 36:28.795
I need you to contact
your old MI6 buddies,

36:28.838 --> 36:31.537
get me access to
a GCHQ satellite.

36:31.580 --> 36:33.669
MI6?

36:33.713 --> 36:35.541
Yeah.
I think there's been
some kind of...

36:35.584 --> 36:36.977
No. Please. Don't
give me the whole

36:37.020 --> 36:38.239
"I don't know what you're
talking about, Thomas."

36:38.283 --> 36:39.762
I know you're former
British Intelligence.

36:39.806 --> 36:42.896
MI6. I can only assume
Robin owes you, too.

36:44.767 --> 36:47.422
How do you know this?

36:47.466 --> 36:49.163
Well, I'm a private
investigator.

36:49.207 --> 36:54.037
I-I know you don't think I'm
a very good one, but... I am.

36:54.081 --> 36:56.039
If you know
I'm former MI6,

36:56.083 --> 36:58.433
then you also know
that I was disavowed.

36:58.477 --> 37:01.219
I'm sure you still
have one friend there.

37:02.829 --> 37:04.309
What is it
you want me to do?

37:04.352 --> 37:05.353
I need you to track
a boat that was out

37:05.397 --> 37:06.963
to open water in
the past four hours.

37:07.007 --> 37:09.444
I'm pretty sure the guys
that are on that boat

37:09.488 --> 37:11.446
are the same guys
that killed Nuzo.

37:11.490 --> 37:13.318
Give me the coordinates.

37:19.976 --> 37:21.717
[computer trilling]

37:21.761 --> 37:23.632
All right, I've got something.

37:23.676 --> 37:25.286
Fishing boat, 40-footer.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.549
Left your coordinates
about three hours ago.

37:27.593 --> 37:28.463
Looks like they crossed

37:28.507 --> 37:29.334
Mamala Bay, so continue east.

37:29.377 --> 37:31.553
Okay. Forget the marina.

37:31.597 --> 37:34.339
It's docked outside a warehouse
on Sand Island.

37:34.382 --> 37:35.862
Slip 14.Thanks.

37:35.905 --> 37:36.993
I can meet you there, you know.

37:37.037 --> 37:38.256
That is so sweet.

37:38.299 --> 37:40.083
Forget I offered.You can't take it back.

37:40.127 --> 37:41.433
Do you want backup or not?
I can be there

37:41.476 --> 37:43.348
in 20 minutes.I'll be fine.

37:43.391 --> 37:45.698
Magnum?Yeah?

37:45.741 --> 37:48.614
Just... bring the car back
in one piece.

37:48.657 --> 37:50.311
I think you mean me.

37:50.355 --> 37:52.618
[scoffs]
Aren't you there yet?

37:52.661 --> 37:54.097
MAGNUM:
Higgins offering to help.

37:54.141 --> 37:55.577
Normally I'd be skeptical,

37:55.621 --> 37:57.579
but that little voice
inside my head was saying

37:57.623 --> 37:59.929
she might actually be worried
about me.HIGGINS: Wait.

37:59.973 --> 38:02.105
Magnum, a truck just left
the warehouse.

38:02.149 --> 38:03.498
Looks old-school military.

38:03.542 --> 38:05.021
Short bed, canvas top,
diesel stack.

38:05.065 --> 38:06.240
My best guess: Unimog.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.502
They're leaving with the gold.

38:07.546 --> 38:08.808
Can you track it?

38:08.851 --> 38:10.331
They're headed north.
The Keyhole's positioned

38:10.375 --> 38:11.550
for open water.

38:11.593 --> 38:13.203
I'm already at the edge
of our coverage.

38:13.247 --> 38:15.118
Reconfiguring a satellite
will take time.

38:15.162 --> 38:16.555
They're not getting away.

38:16.598 --> 38:17.991
[line ringing]

38:18.034 --> 38:19.645

heading north.

38:22.430 --> 38:25.346
Gotcha, White Knight.

38:25.390 --> 38:26.608
Your chariot's
on its way.

be a thing now?

Magnum, I got access to another
satellite-- a U.S. Keyhole.

38:39.360 --> 38:40.230
How'd you do that?

38:40.274 --> 38:41.449
Don't ask.

38:41.493 --> 38:42.581
Actually, I'd like to ask.

38:42.624 --> 38:44.757
TC: Hey, Higgy,
welcome to the party.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.281
Technically I was first
to the party, but thank you.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.761
There! TC!

38:48.804 --> 38:51.503
Magnum, we got 'em.
They're headed up Tantalus.

38:51.546 --> 38:52.634
Don't lose 'em!

38:52.678 --> 38:53.679
Not gonna happen.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.122
[tires squealing,

39:02.165 --> 39:03.602
Okay, White Knight,
what's your plan?

39:03.645 --> 39:05.386
I'm working on it.

39:05.430 --> 39:08.258
You don't have a plan, do you?Right now,
I'm open to suggestions.

39:08.302 --> 39:09.738
Mine includes not destroying
another one

39:09.782 --> 39:10.957
of Mr. Masters' Ferraris.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.393
That's not a plan.

39:12.437 --> 39:15.353
Correct. Simply a wish.

39:20.401 --> 39:21.924
[engine revving]

39:21.968 --> 39:24.187
Magnum, there's a civilian
approaching.

39:24.231 --> 39:25.319
I see it!TC: If you're gonna

39:25.363 --> 39:26.712
do something, do it now.

39:34.110 --> 39:35.808
[gunshot]

39:39.159 --> 39:41.509

Remember that little stunt
from Robin Masters' book?

39:41.553 --> 39:44.817
Well, let's see
if it actually works.

39:44.860 --> 39:45.644
Higgins?Yes?

39:45.687 --> 39:46.688
Close your eyes.

39:47.733 --> 39:50.475
Why would I close my eyes?

39:52.738 --> 39:54.479

Okay. That didn't work.

40:19.721 --> 40:22.681
[sighs]

40:22.724 --> 40:25.161
MAGNUM:
Sure, Robin's gonna be pissed.

40:25.205 --> 40:27.163
He loved that car.

40:27.207 --> 40:29.644
But in the end,
we got Nuzo's killers,

40:29.688 --> 40:31.733
and now that gold gets to go
to the people

40:31.777 --> 40:33.822
who need it the most.

40:45.530 --> 40:50.186
People ask me all the time,
"What's with the ring?"

40:50.230 --> 40:51.753
The Cross of Lorraine
was the symbol

40:51.797 --> 40:54.060
of the French Resistance,
but to us,

40:54.103 --> 40:57.803
it represented our friendship,
and the pact that we made

40:57.846 --> 41:01.067
back in the POW camp to always
be there for one another.

41:01.110 --> 41:03.678
Rick, TC

41:03.722 --> 41:07.813
and the man
we're burying today--

41:07.856 --> 41:10.685
friends like those come around
once in a lifetime.

41:14.297 --> 41:16.778
But maybe I'm wrong about that.

41:23.524 --> 41:25.918
Right there.

41:25.961 --> 41:29.530
My dad's here, isn't he?

41:29.574 --> 41:32.490
Yes, he is.

it's still safer.
