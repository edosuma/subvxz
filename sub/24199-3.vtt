WEBVTT

00:00.046 --> 00:02.414
Previously on
The Americans...

00:02.516 --> 00:04.116
Guess who's in town?

00:04.218 --> 00:06.752
CIA says he's been out of
the KGB for three years.

00:06.854 --> 00:10.455
We want you to find out what
your wife is doing and tell us.

00:10.558 --> 00:12.457
And if you have to,
stop her.

00:12.560 --> 00:16.193
The future of our country
is being decided right now.

00:16.297 --> 00:18.931
I'm sorry. Look. I have to
talk to you about something.

00:19.033 --> 00:21.934
If you knew how tired I am,
you wouldn't still be talking.

00:22.036 --> 00:23.502
You are the only
person I can call.

00:23.604 --> 00:25.971
Every little thing
I ever do is wrong.

00:26.073 --> 00:27.673
I want a divorce, Stan.

00:27.775 --> 00:29.041
If you leave--

00:29.143 --> 00:31.977
Gennadi is doing
dangerous work,

00:32.079 --> 00:33.946
and you're a big part
of it.

00:34.048 --> 00:36.148
You will figure it out,
okay?

00:36.250 --> 00:40.152
The Centre wants you to contact
your old friend Lyle Rennhull.

00:40.254 --> 00:42.387
A general now.
You're to try and get something

00:42.489 --> 00:45.724
called a lithium-based
radiation sensor.

00:45.826 --> 00:47.492
I'm not going to
betray my country.

00:47.595 --> 00:48.961
Okay. Please.

00:53.467 --> 00:54.566
Mom. Are you...?

00:54.668 --> 00:56.368
Go back to your car.

00:56.470 --> 00:58.003
Now!

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.856 --> 01:53.225
You know this group
I go to sometimes?

01:53.327 --> 01:54.693
EST?

01:54.795 --> 01:58.063
It's, uh-- It's called
the Forum now, but yeah...

01:58.165 --> 01:59.865
They talk about...

01:59.967 --> 02:04.569
letting yourself
feel bad or scared,

02:04.672 --> 02:06.972
if that's what
you're feeling.

02:07.074 --> 02:09.775
I feel fine. I'm fine.

02:11.178 --> 02:14.646
It's important
not to push it away.

02:15.749 --> 02:19.251
It's better to feel bad
and go through it

02:19.353 --> 02:21.953
than to pretend
not to feel anything.

02:26.326 --> 02:30.629
Paige, these things...

02:30.731 --> 02:32.998
I saw some bad things too.

02:33.100 --> 02:36.134
It's hard to deal
with it all...

02:36.236 --> 02:39.404
You have to, but...

02:43.110 --> 02:44.843
How did you...

02:44.945 --> 02:46.578
I don't know...

02:48.115 --> 02:50.482
I don't know.
I had your mom.

02:50.584 --> 02:52.317
You do too.

02:54.855 --> 02:56.621
You okay?

02:59.960 --> 03:01.760
Yeah.

03:04.231 --> 03:05.797
What happened, Mom?

03:05.899 --> 03:08.166
What happened is
you left your position

03:08.268 --> 03:09.968
and ran straight
into the middle of a--

03:21.648 --> 03:22.547
Hello?

03:22.649 --> 03:23.815
Hey, Dad.

03:23.917 --> 03:25.217
Henry, what's up?

03:25.319 --> 03:27.819
We won! First loss
for Tilton this season.

03:27.921 --> 03:29.488
That's great.

03:29.590 --> 03:31.690
Wasn't Tilton league champions
the last two seasons?

03:31.792 --> 03:32.858
What was the score?

03:32.960 --> 03:34.626
Yeah. Three to two.

03:34.728 --> 03:37.295
- I got the game-winning assist.
- Well, that's fantastic.

03:37.397 --> 03:38.864
Look. I'm just in the
middle of a work thing.

03:38.966 --> 03:40.999
I'm gonna call you
tomorrow, okay?

03:41.101 --> 03:43.535
Yeah, sure.
Just not too late, all right?

03:43.637 --> 03:45.570
I have an AP Calc test
Monday morning.

03:45.672 --> 03:47.405
- Great news about the game.
- Thanks, Dad.

03:47.508 --> 03:49.141
Bye.

03:51.578 --> 03:53.578
I heard a shot...

03:53.680 --> 03:56.014
I didn't know if...

03:56.116 --> 03:57.916
I didn't know
what to do...

03:58.018 --> 04:00.519
You were supposed to do
what you were told to do.

04:00.621 --> 04:02.554
- I thought you were--
- You left your position

04:02.656 --> 04:05.490
and walked straight into
the middle of a meeting.

04:05.592 --> 04:08.026
If anybody else on the team
did that, they'd be finished.

04:08.128 --> 04:10.095
- I just couldn't--
- No! You don't get to talk about

04:10.197 --> 04:13.665
what you thought or how you felt
or anything else. Not now.

04:13.767 --> 04:15.500
Do you understand
what you did?

04:15.602 --> 04:19.036
Hey, this isn't great.

04:19.139 --> 04:21.540
I think there's a lot
to talk about here.

04:21.642 --> 04:22.941
There isn't, Philip.

04:23.043 --> 04:25.377
It's very simple.
You stick to the plan.

04:27.648 --> 04:30.515
I'm sorry, Mom.

04:30.617 --> 04:32.517
I screwed up.

04:37.391 --> 04:38.890
We'll talk more later.

04:40.828 --> 04:42.761
Is it okay
if I stay here tonight?

04:42.863 --> 04:45.263
- Of course.
- No, it's not all right.

04:45.365 --> 04:47.933
This is a work night.
Go home.

05:07.554 --> 05:09.888
She's pretty much
seen it all now.

05:14.494 --> 05:16.161
Not all of it.

05:30.611 --> 05:32.577
I told her
she'd have you.

05:32.679 --> 05:34.145
To talk to.

05:36.717 --> 05:39.150
What do you think
I was just doing?

05:45.459 --> 05:47.792
Paige said it was
a military guy.

05:52.966 --> 05:54.633
Rennhull.

05:54.735 --> 05:56.768
Rennhull?

05:56.870 --> 05:59.004
What are you doing with him
after all this time?

06:00.207 --> 06:04.276
He's got access
to this thing.

06:04.378 --> 06:06.811
Some kind of
radiation sensor.

06:06.914 --> 06:08.647
Had access.

06:09.883 --> 06:10.916
What?

06:11.885 --> 06:13.985
Had access.

06:16.890 --> 06:18.957
Yeah.

06:22.162 --> 06:24.529
He was an idealist.
What happened?

06:26.967 --> 06:28.566
He was going to kill me.

06:28.669 --> 06:30.969
Paige thinks
he killed himself.

06:31.071 --> 06:33.571
He did.

06:35.342 --> 06:39.044
I didn't have time
to work him, I...

06:39.146 --> 06:42.714
I moved too fast.

06:46.987 --> 06:48.853
There's trouble back home.

06:50.624 --> 06:53.058
What are you
talking about?

06:57.297 --> 07:00.265
With Gorbachev.

07:00.367 --> 07:02.300
I don't know
that much about it.

07:03.704 --> 07:06.137
What do they need
the sensor for?

07:11.678 --> 07:13.478
I ca-- I can't.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.962
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

07:52.661 --> 07:54.995
Don't try to change
my mind, Stan.

07:55.097 --> 07:58.032
- I'm not trying to--
- You are a nice guy,

07:58.134 --> 07:59.633
but you always get
what you want.

07:59.735 --> 08:00.968
From me, and Gennadi.

08:02.972 --> 08:04.872
My friend Bogdan,

08:04.974 --> 08:07.274
he says I'm too much
listening to you.

08:07.376 --> 08:09.677
I need to listen
to my heart.

08:16.085 --> 08:20.821
You talked to Bogdan
about me.

08:20.923 --> 08:22.923
I trust him.

08:25.561 --> 08:27.461
If you told him about
what you and Gennadi

08:27.563 --> 08:30.397
have been doing for us--
that would be dangerous.

08:30.499 --> 08:33.000
For Gennadi,

08:33.102 --> 08:34.668
for both of you.

08:35.770 --> 08:37.972
I am not a child, Stan.

08:39.342 --> 08:41.342
I trust Bogdan.

08:41.443 --> 08:44.645
And we are Soviets.

08:44.747 --> 08:48.315
We know how to keep secrets.
It is what we do.

09:08.004 --> 09:10.371
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

09:27.890 --> 09:29.456
St. Edward's Academy.

09:29.558 --> 09:31.191
Hi, this is, uh,
Philip Jennings,

09:31.293 --> 09:32.693
calling David Sato back.

09:32.795 --> 09:34.895
One moment.

09:34.997 --> 09:35.896
Hello?

09:35.998 --> 09:37.531
Hi, David,
it's Philip Jennings.

09:37.633 --> 09:39.366
Thanks for
calling me back.

09:39.468 --> 09:41.068
I wanted to
check in with you

09:41.170 --> 09:43.370
about this
quarter's billing.

09:43.472 --> 09:44.905
We haven't
gotten payment yet.

09:45.007 --> 09:46.540
Uh, yeah, well,
I'm real glad you did call,

09:46.642 --> 09:48.609
because I was about
to put a check in the mail.

09:48.711 --> 09:50.711
But I wanted to talk
to you first.

09:50.813 --> 09:54.415
Um, we've been having this
really big boom at work...

09:54.517 --> 09:55.916
Oh, that's good.

09:56.018 --> 09:57.785
Uh, yeah, it's
really good, actually.

09:57.887 --> 10:00.254
Uh, but it's all
happened so fast,

10:00.356 --> 10:02.890
because the office next door became
available, we had to jump on that,

10:02.992 --> 10:05.959
I hired a bunch
of new people...

10:06.062 --> 10:08.062
- Wow.
- Yeah, it's really exciting.

10:08.164 --> 10:10.898
Um, but I had to put some real
money down to cover the expansion.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.266
So, what I was
wondering, David,

10:12.368 --> 10:15.803
is if we could, uh,
restructure the, um--

10:15.905 --> 10:17.905
the tuition payments
for this year.

10:18.007 --> 10:21.075
St. Edward's doesn't
really do that, uh...

10:21.177 --> 10:23.510
No, I know. I get it.
You know, I'm in business.

10:23.612 --> 10:26.513
And, um, I've had
some long-term customers

10:26.615 --> 10:28.182
who have made
similar requests.

10:28.284 --> 10:30.250
But, you know, when I know
them, like you know me--

10:30.352 --> 10:32.352
because we've been at
St. Edward's for three years--

10:32.455 --> 10:34.154
never been late,
never will be again...

10:34.256 --> 10:37.091
Uh, you know,
it's just been an odd year.

10:37.193 --> 10:40.127
Um, and believe me,
the scholarship helps...

10:40.229 --> 10:42.162
but, uh, it's a stretch.

10:46.368 --> 10:48.469
What exactly did
you have in mind?

10:48.571 --> 10:50.604
Just let me get through
the holiday season,

10:50.706 --> 10:53.440
um, you know, that's when
things really come in for us,

10:53.542 --> 10:54.842
and then I'll catch up.

10:54.944 --> 10:57.211
If it's really
just this one time...

10:57.313 --> 10:58.145
It is.

10:59.715 --> 11:01.248
Okay.

11:02.785 --> 11:04.384
Thank you,
thank you so much.

11:04.487 --> 11:07.121
Please don't tell anyone.
If I had to do

11:07.223 --> 11:09.356
different payment options
for every family...

11:09.458 --> 11:10.791
Of course.
And if you need

11:10.893 --> 11:12.793
a really good deal
on the Bahamas...

11:12.895 --> 11:14.828
Call me.
We'll take care of you.

11:14.930 --> 11:17.664
Thanks.

11:24.941 --> 11:27.341
I made a mistake.
A really bad one.

11:27.443 --> 11:29.843
I get that.

11:29.946 --> 11:31.879
Good.

11:31.981 --> 11:34.615
I can't get...

11:34.717 --> 11:37.384
what I saw,
out of my mind.

11:37.486 --> 11:39.286
What happened?

11:42.224 --> 11:44.525
When you meet someone...
a source...

11:44.627 --> 11:47.227
you're taking a risk.
You know that.

11:47.330 --> 11:50.564
But you can't ever
really know

11:50.666 --> 11:53.767
what's going on
inside someone's head.

11:54.837 --> 11:56.637
I tried to stop him.

11:56.739 --> 11:58.505
He must've been crazy.

11:59.508 --> 12:02.076
I wouldn't say that.

12:02.178 --> 12:06.080
He was... troubled.
Desperate.

12:06.182 --> 12:08.215
About what?

12:09.986 --> 12:13.654
He was caught up in something,
and didn't see a way out.

12:13.756 --> 12:16.490
He wasn't
thinking straight.

12:18.327 --> 12:20.861
The truth is,

12:20.963 --> 12:23.864
I miscalculated, too.

12:23.966 --> 12:26.300
It shouldn't
have happened.

12:28.637 --> 12:29.870
Who was he?

12:29.972 --> 12:32.740
An American general.

12:35.011 --> 12:38.612
And I was trying to get him
to give me something

12:38.714 --> 12:42.383
that we need to keep
our country safe.

12:42.485 --> 12:47.654
So for me, no matter
how risky it is-- it's okay.

12:50.159 --> 12:52.326
What do you mean,
it's okay?

12:57.366 --> 12:59.633
That no matter
what happens to me,

12:59.735 --> 13:03.637
if I'm fighting for something
that's that important...

13:03.739 --> 13:07.408
You don't care
if you die?

13:07.510 --> 13:09.676
Well, of course I do.

13:17.053 --> 13:19.286
But I'm not afraid.

13:20.423 --> 13:22.723
You can't live your life
being afraid, Paige.

13:22.825 --> 13:25.626
There's no point.
You wouldn't do anything.

13:27.329 --> 13:29.630
You want to make a difference,
you make a difference.

13:33.002 --> 13:35.469
So, what's going to
happen with...

13:35.571 --> 13:38.272
I mean, the police,
and...?

13:40.376 --> 13:41.675
Hopefully, they think

13:41.777 --> 13:43.677
he was troubled,
and committed suicide.

13:43.779 --> 13:45.679
- What if they don't?
- If they don't, they don't.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.281
I don't have
all the answers.

13:47.383 --> 13:49.149
What I do know

13:49.251 --> 13:52.920
is that you put me, yourself,
the whole team at risk.

13:53.022 --> 13:54.488
That's why we have
the procedures.

13:54.590 --> 13:56.457
That's why you can't just
come running in there

13:56.559 --> 13:58.358
when you think
things have gone bad.

13:58.461 --> 14:01.295
Especially if you think
things have gone bad.

14:01.397 --> 14:04.898
I know, Mom. I-I get it.
I really do.

14:11.006 --> 14:12.439
You won't
have to be caught

14:12.541 --> 14:14.374
in the middle of
all this kind of stuff.

14:14.477 --> 14:16.543
Your job will
be different.

14:16.645 --> 14:18.178
But you still
have to know

14:18.280 --> 14:21.281
how to deal with things
like this, just in case...

14:30.119 --> 14:32.719
_

14:39.835 --> 14:42.136
Thank you so much for coming in.
We'll see you again.

14:42.238 --> 14:44.037
Yes.

14:44.140 --> 14:46.140
Take care. Bye.

14:46.242 --> 14:47.741
All right.
Everybody! Listen up.

14:47.843 --> 14:51.111
Rick. Stand up.
Stand up.

14:53.349 --> 14:57.751
Yesterday, you sold two
Caribbean couples' cruises.

14:57.853 --> 15:01.522
Tell us three
of the strategies you used

15:01.624 --> 15:03.924
to sell those trips.

15:04.026 --> 15:05.726
Well... uh...

15:05.828 --> 15:08.362
I talked about what an exclusive
deal we were offering...

15:08.464 --> 15:11.365
Value. All right?
Value.

15:11.467 --> 15:13.567
Value. One.

15:13.669 --> 15:18.205
I... showed them
the deck plan of the ship.

15:18.307 --> 15:19.773
Pointed out
where their cabin was

15:19.875 --> 15:22.109
in relation
to the stairways, restaurants.

15:22.211 --> 15:24.278
Images. All right?
He's bringing it to life.

15:24.380 --> 15:26.046
Great. Two.

15:26.148 --> 15:28.115
And... uh...

15:28.217 --> 15:30.851
Mm.

15:30.953 --> 15:33.954
I up-sold them on booking
their dining options onboard.

15:34.056 --> 15:35.422
And shore excursions.

15:35.524 --> 15:39.393
Perfect. Up-selling,
that's three. Great.

15:39.495 --> 15:42.062
Lacey. Why are cruises
so important to us?

15:43.132 --> 15:46.400
I...uh... profit?

15:46.502 --> 15:48.468
No, that's right.
T-The market pays.

15:48.571 --> 15:50.103
It gives our clients
excellent value

15:50.206 --> 15:52.072
and we get a commission
on the whole package.

15:52.174 --> 15:55.042
Plus... and I'm sure
Rick knows this one...

15:55.144 --> 15:57.778
what kind of customers
are they?

15:59.682 --> 16:01.215
I don't know...

16:01.317 --> 16:03.417
Think about the Duffs.

16:03.519 --> 16:04.985
Oh, they go
every spring.

16:05.087 --> 16:06.787
Repeat customers.

16:06.889 --> 16:10.090
If we get them to go once,
they will probably go again.

16:10.192 --> 16:12.125
Great. Great, Rick.

16:14.163 --> 16:15.762
Everybody.

16:18.334 --> 16:21.935
Now. Can all of you commit,
right here,

16:22.037 --> 16:24.271
to using all of
these strategies,

16:24.373 --> 16:27.107
every time you talk
to a customer?

16:27.209 --> 16:29.776
- Yes.
- Yeah.

16:29.878 --> 16:32.379
Yes! Okay! Great!

16:33.716 --> 16:35.816
Okay.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.153
So we don't know anything
about this Bogdan.

16:40.256 --> 16:42.089
Just that
he's some kind of journalist.

16:42.191 --> 16:44.791
A "senior correspondent."

16:46.595 --> 16:48.128
When's Gennadi
coming back?

16:48.230 --> 16:50.697
Four days.
If he comes back.

16:50.799 --> 16:53.367
Let's get the CIA
to pull him out.

16:53.469 --> 16:55.102
Better to do it here.

16:55.204 --> 16:56.603
Four days
is a long time.

16:56.705 --> 16:58.372
By the time they plan it,

16:58.474 --> 17:01.108
chances something
getting screwed up...

17:01.210 --> 17:03.343
Look, I'm not happy
that he's over there.

17:03.445 --> 17:05.112
But waiting it out's
our best shot.

17:05.214 --> 17:06.780
I don't know.

17:12.954 --> 17:15.355
Have we ever gotten
one good thing off that X-ray?

17:15.457 --> 17:17.824
Aw, come on. You're like
a goddamn broken record, Stan.

17:17.925 --> 17:20.527
It's been three years. How many
times you think he can fake a shit

17:20.628 --> 17:23.630
in an airport crapper
without them figuring it out?

17:23.732 --> 17:26.066
And now her,
with this Bogdan...

17:26.167 --> 17:28.367
she says to me--
we know how to keep secrets.

17:28.470 --> 17:31.071
Is she kidding me?

17:31.173 --> 17:33.907
She has no idea what a target
she just put on his back.

17:34.009 --> 17:35.676
Maybe Bogdan's okay.

17:35.778 --> 17:38.745
Yeah, I don't love a guy
who works for TASS.

17:38.847 --> 17:40.380
She works for TASS.
She's okay.

17:55.464 --> 17:58.498
You hear about the general who
committed suicide in the park?

18:02.438 --> 18:04.738
Not the place I'd do it.

18:06.442 --> 18:09.076
No history of depression.

18:09.178 --> 18:12.312
One of the key guys
working on SDI.

18:14.783 --> 18:16.550
You brought him in
a few years back, right?

18:17.853 --> 18:21.388
Yeah. He shot a guy who accused
him of being a Soviet spy.

18:21.490 --> 18:24.791
Other guy looked like
a complete lunatic.

18:24.893 --> 18:26.993
But now he shoots himself?

18:32.134 --> 18:34.234
Seen our friend
from out of town yet?

18:35.637 --> 18:37.804
Not yet.

18:40.008 --> 18:41.875
Soon would be good.

18:45.381 --> 18:46.713
There was a donation.

18:46.815 --> 18:50.817
Twenty thousand dollars.
From a man named Stenin.

18:50.919 --> 18:53.186
- First name?
- I don't know.

18:55.157 --> 18:56.990
Father Valery said,

18:57.092 --> 18:59.826
the powers that be won't
stop me from using this

18:59.928 --> 19:02.629
to rebuild the steps
leading to the choir.

19:02.731 --> 19:04.731
Everyone thought he'd have
trouble with the prior,

19:04.833 --> 19:07.534
but he hasn't
been touched.

19:12.741 --> 19:15.609
I've been teaching
my daughter about us.

19:15.711 --> 19:18.078
Our culture and history.

19:20.282 --> 19:22.082
I teach a class
with several children

19:22.184 --> 19:25.852
who have never
been home at all.

19:25.954 --> 19:28.321
It's strange when they
have to learn it from books.

19:28.424 --> 19:30.457
Mm.

19:30.559 --> 19:34.628
I-I actually think
she's getting it.

19:34.730 --> 19:37.464
I need to learn your tricks.

19:42.571 --> 19:45.105
How are things
with your husband?

19:47.876 --> 19:49.810
He's not sure I know
how to handle her.

19:52.214 --> 19:55.649
That's something
parents fight about.

19:55.751 --> 19:57.617
Hmm.

20:00.756 --> 20:03.423
It's more than that.

20:05.894 --> 20:10.363
He has his life
and I have mine now.

20:10.466 --> 20:12.499
And she's with me.

20:12.601 --> 20:14.034
I'd like to see him.

20:14.136 --> 20:17.504
Maybe next time
he can come.

20:17.606 --> 20:19.840
He's out of it now.
He quit.

20:19.942 --> 20:22.142
I know.

20:22.244 --> 20:23.743
But he can come
one time.

20:23.846 --> 20:25.412
Tell him...

20:25.514 --> 20:28.114
tell him that
I asked for him.

20:50.823 --> 20:51.855
You good?

20:53.459 --> 20:54.491
Yeah.

20:56.228 --> 20:59.096
You sure?
Because I need you okay.

20:59.198 --> 21:01.098
I'm good.

21:42.508 --> 21:44.575
- You guys ready for this?
- Yes. I am very excited.

21:44.677 --> 21:45.776
There are all
different kinds,

21:45.878 --> 21:47.778
and everybody
has their favorite.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.780
Well, Chicago has
the best pizza, hands down.

21:49.882 --> 21:52.115
Oh, it's disgusting.
It's too much bread.

21:52.217 --> 21:54.318
See? Anyways, New York
has the best pizza.

21:54.420 --> 21:56.820
- What is the difference?
- Yes...

21:56.922 --> 21:59.957
Uh, just try this one, and then
we'll get into differences...

22:08.133 --> 22:09.700
I went to
a Russian restaurant

22:09.802 --> 22:11.368
last time I was
in New York City.

22:11.470 --> 22:12.869
- It was very good.
- What-- What--

22:12.972 --> 22:14.371
What did you have?
What did you like there?

22:14.473 --> 22:16.640
Uh, it was something with meat,
and it had a potato.

22:16.742 --> 22:19.610
Every dish in Russia starts
with meat and potatoes.

22:19.712 --> 22:21.812
And Smetana.

22:21.914 --> 22:23.880
- Mm-hmm.
- It's like sour cream.

22:23.983 --> 22:28.218
I-I tried some here in America,
but it's not like home.

22:28.320 --> 22:30.354
Well, because American cows
are different.

22:42.368 --> 22:46.269
Right. Appreciate it.
Have a good day.

22:48.107 --> 22:51.241
- You'll like this.
- Hope everybody's hungry, huh?

23:01.320 --> 23:03.854
I still think the Tigers
have a chance. Martin!

23:03.956 --> 23:05.189
- Are you insane?
- No way.

23:05.291 --> 23:07.725
- With Blyleven pitching?
- Blasphemy.

23:07.827 --> 23:10.361
- You know anything about baseball?
- No, no.

23:10.463 --> 23:12.029
- Hockey is much better.
- Ah.

23:12.131 --> 23:14.298
Yeah. We've enjoyed
the Canadian Cup this year.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.632
Didn't you guys lose?

23:15.735 --> 23:18.869
Yes, we did, but to
Gretzky and Lemieux.

23:18.971 --> 23:21.372
Which is
very good competition.

23:21.474 --> 23:23.974
- Ah.
- Baseball is good too.

23:24.076 --> 23:27.544
The Twins are going
to the World Series.

23:27.646 --> 23:30.414
Two words.
Kirby Puckett.

23:30.516 --> 23:32.082
- Glenn's an optimist.
- Oh, I've been rooting

23:32.184 --> 23:33.817
for the Minnesota Twins
ever since I'm a kid

23:33.919 --> 23:36.053
way back when they were
called the Senators.

23:36.155 --> 23:38.222
I bought every baseball card,
every poster,

23:38.324 --> 23:41.792
every jacket,
every jersey I could find.

23:41.894 --> 23:44.395
And now you wear that weird
Japanese jacket instead.

23:44.497 --> 23:46.463
Every time
Glenn watches a game now

23:46.565 --> 23:48.799
he wears a Japanese
baseball jacket.

23:48.901 --> 23:51.001
When I was posted
in Japan,

23:51.103 --> 23:54.571
my wife and I used to
watch this team,

23:54.673 --> 23:56.907
the Yakult Swallows,
play all the time.

23:57.009 --> 23:59.410
We never understood a single
word the announcer said

23:59.512 --> 24:03.113
but watching them play
was such a...

24:03.215 --> 24:05.949
such a joy.

24:07.853 --> 24:09.987
My wife...

24:10.089 --> 24:12.823
she bought me
their team jacket...

24:15.895 --> 24:18.128
You guys really need to see
a game while you're here.

24:18.230 --> 24:20.664
- Yeah.
- Let's do something for the World Series.

24:20.766 --> 24:21.965
And you can come
to my house.

24:22.067 --> 24:23.767
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you but no. We cannot.

24:23.869 --> 24:27.337
- No, but thank you.
- I will come.

24:28.574 --> 24:30.007
If I understand baseball,

24:30.109 --> 24:33.043
maybe I will understand
America better.

24:34.613 --> 24:35.846
I don't know about that,

24:35.948 --> 24:38.215
but it's good to unwind
from this stuff.

24:38.317 --> 24:40.617
Yeah.
Lots of work ahead of us

24:40.719 --> 24:43.420
before Shultz
gets back from Moscow.

25:18.290 --> 25:19.556
Gonna invite me in?

25:38.110 --> 25:41.578
Everything that went down
in Moscow.

25:41.680 --> 25:43.380
They told me
they were going to do it.

25:44.550 --> 25:46.183
I told them
you weren't a traitor

25:46.285 --> 25:48.285
and it would
get you killed.

25:48.387 --> 25:49.753
I threatened them--

25:49.855 --> 25:51.922
I said I would expose
all kinds of things

25:52.024 --> 25:55.092
if they went through
with it.

25:55.194 --> 25:56.860
That's why
they backed off.

25:56.962 --> 26:00.931
But I am sorry it happened
in the first place.

26:05.571 --> 26:08.205
- That's it?
- Yeah.

26:22.321 --> 26:25.923
I'm not in
Counterintelligence anymore.

26:26.025 --> 26:29.793
I work in the Criminal
Investigative Division.

26:31.564 --> 26:32.729
What's that?

26:32.831 --> 26:35.966
Bank robbery,
money laundering, drugs...

26:36.068 --> 26:37.734
Hmm.

26:40.873 --> 26:45.509
And you?
Urban transport planning?

26:45.611 --> 26:46.910
What is that, exactly?

26:47.012 --> 26:51.748
Supply analysis,
scheduling,

26:51.850 --> 26:54.251
microeconomics of basic

26:54.353 --> 26:56.286
transportational
infrastructure--

26:56.388 --> 26:57.688
trains, subway...

26:57.790 --> 27:00.524
You came all the way
from Moscow for that?

27:00.626 --> 27:03.060
George Mason's
civil engineering department

27:03.162 --> 27:04.595
is one of the best.

27:07.800 --> 27:11.301
I saw that your course started
two and a half weeks ago.

27:11.403 --> 27:14.638
If it's so important, why
didn't you come when it started?

27:15.908 --> 27:19.409
My father asked me to.
But I said no.

27:21.714 --> 27:26.450
Then I-- I needed
some time away.

27:26.552 --> 27:29.119
From my wife.

27:29.221 --> 27:31.755
You can understand that,
right?

27:38.764 --> 27:40.297
What are you
doing here, Oleg?

27:40.399 --> 27:42.032
I told you.

27:49.808 --> 27:51.708
Do you ever...

27:51.810 --> 27:53.910
think about her at all?

27:54.013 --> 27:58.215
Or all that is
in the past for you?

28:00.653 --> 28:02.152
I think about her.

28:02.254 --> 28:05.555
'Cause I used to
think I saw her.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.327
In the streets,

28:10.429 --> 28:11.862
on the subway,

28:11.964 --> 28:14.364
parks.

28:14.466 --> 28:17.634
And it was like...
a shock.

28:18.771 --> 28:20.904
Yeah.

28:22.841 --> 28:26.343
They had the tape you made
of our conversation.

28:27.546 --> 28:30.247
And they said they were
gonna use it against me

28:30.349 --> 28:33.550
and my family
if I didn't cooperate.

28:33.652 --> 28:34.985
I'm sorry.

28:36.455 --> 28:38.755
I fought them
every step of the way.

28:38.857 --> 28:40.357
Bullshit.

28:46.465 --> 28:51.468
You are here without
a diplomatic passport, Oleg.

28:51.570 --> 28:54.371
Whatever you're
doing here--

28:54.473 --> 28:55.472
don't.

29:10.837 --> 29:14.105
It's peasant food.
They know how to survive.

29:14.207 --> 29:16.841
We're always having
droughts, famines, wars...

29:18.378 --> 29:20.611
My mother used to
make pots of this,

29:20.713 --> 29:22.113
we'd eat it for weeks.

29:22.215 --> 29:25.917
You never
got sick of it?

29:26.019 --> 29:28.653
That wasn't an issue.

29:28.755 --> 29:30.922
Vegetables ready?

29:35.562 --> 29:38.229
Mmm.

29:41.901 --> 29:43.501
Ah. Very good.

29:45.805 --> 29:48.306
Beautiful.

29:48.408 --> 29:53.711
I'm gonna spread this out
so it gets nice and golden.

29:53.813 --> 29:58.149
Lower the flame,
we don't want it to burn.

29:58.251 --> 30:00.618
After a few minutes,
we put it in the crock

30:00.720 --> 30:04.856
with meat and garlic
and broth.

30:06.726 --> 30:08.392
Rough couple of days?

30:08.495 --> 30:10.595
I'm fine.

30:11.731 --> 30:14.465
How is this different
from solyanka?

30:14.567 --> 30:16.400
Solyanka is a soup.

30:16.503 --> 30:19.303
Zharkoye is a stew.
It's thicker.

30:21.908 --> 30:24.408
Maybe we should teach her
how to make golubtsy.

30:24.511 --> 30:26.844
My grandmother
used to make that.

30:26.946 --> 30:29.881
What's golubtsy?

30:29.983 --> 30:32.183
Shredded beef
in boiled cabbage.

30:32.285 --> 30:33.751
With sour cream on top.

30:33.853 --> 30:36.153
Which was very hard to get
back home...

30:37.824 --> 30:39.690
Will you run to the store
and buy us some sour cream

30:39.792 --> 30:41.058
while we clean up?

30:41.160 --> 30:43.160
We have some.

30:43.263 --> 30:45.530
We could use
some more.

30:56.442 --> 30:58.109
Here's a new target
and ID.

30:58.211 --> 31:00.878
He's a supervisor at the
warehouse where Altheon ships

31:00.980 --> 31:03.848
and does quality assurance
for the sensors.

31:07.387 --> 31:09.720
This really does
smell good.

31:11.624 --> 31:12.823
I know.

31:34.080 --> 31:36.414
I brought you
something.

31:38.818 --> 31:40.651
I know that it's not
supposed to be in the house,

31:40.753 --> 31:43.454
but...

31:46.259 --> 31:48.626
we made zharkoye.

32:01.708 --> 32:03.608
That smells great.

32:07.046 --> 32:11.048
But I just ate a whole order
of kung pao chicken and lo mein.

32:15.088 --> 32:17.021
Can't keep it around.

32:21.628 --> 32:22.893
Wait.

32:37.610 --> 32:39.310
That is delicious.

33:07.340 --> 33:10.975
We cook...
Claudia and Paige and me.

33:11.077 --> 33:13.678
And we...
watch movies from home

33:13.780 --> 33:14.979
and... listen to music

33:15.081 --> 33:18.215
and... talk.

33:21.187 --> 33:23.120
It feels...

33:25.525 --> 33:28.025
And then
I walk out of there

33:28.127 --> 33:32.029
and it just...
hits me in the face.

33:32.131 --> 33:33.497
Here.

33:39.939 --> 33:41.172
Yeah.

33:41.274 --> 33:44.341
I hate it, Philip.

33:50.149 --> 33:53.517
Honestly, the way
things are going...

33:54.787 --> 33:56.353
I think,
in a couple years...

33:56.456 --> 33:58.689
we'll have Stan over here
for zharkoye.

34:01.627 --> 34:03.160
What are you
talking about?

34:04.797 --> 34:08.099
Things are changing back home.
Opening up.

34:08.201 --> 34:09.533
And it's not
just politics--

34:09.635 --> 34:11.969
it's-- it's the young people,
it's music.

34:12.071 --> 34:13.637
It's-- It's different.

34:13.739 --> 34:15.973
I mean, they're talking about
opening a Pizza Hut in Moscow.

34:16.074 --> 34:17.507
You see the papers.

34:19.846 --> 34:22.012
What--
"The Washington Post"?

34:23.014 --> 34:25.750
You know, all this talk--
perestroika and glasnost.

34:25.851 --> 34:28.219
The Americans eat it up.

34:28.321 --> 34:29.954
They want us to be
just like them.

34:30.056 --> 34:32.690
I don't want to be
like them.

34:33.559 --> 34:36.827
And neither do
the people back home.

34:36.929 --> 34:40.630
You haven't talked to anyone
back home in over twenty years.

34:42.902 --> 34:44.869
Neither have you.

34:54.580 --> 34:55.980
...so I told him,

34:56.081 --> 34:58.449
so why don't you let
one branch manager do it?

34:58.551 --> 35:00.618
- Mm-hmm.?
- It's not gonna open the floodgates.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.787
Our retention is up
two percent over last year.

35:02.889 --> 35:05.256
That's a lot stronger than
you're seeing industry-wide.

35:05.358 --> 35:06.824
He was thrilled.

35:06.926 --> 35:08.526
Oh, that's great,
honey.

35:08.628 --> 35:10.261
Yeah.

35:10.363 --> 35:12.863
It's nice of you
to say that.

35:12.965 --> 35:13.931
What do you mean?

35:14.033 --> 35:16.167
I know it's boring
for you.

35:16.269 --> 35:18.502
- I mean-- it is boring.
- No, it isn't.

35:18.604 --> 35:20.771
No, it's okay.
You don't have to pretend.

35:22.041 --> 35:25.176
Truth is, I think I'm jealous
of how much you care.

35:25.278 --> 35:27.678
About your job.
What you do.

35:27.780 --> 35:30.848
I wish I cared
half as much about my work.

35:30.950 --> 35:32.850
Well, you've been there
a long time.

35:32.952 --> 35:34.785
Too long.

35:34.887 --> 35:36.387
I used to like it.

35:36.489 --> 35:39.223
Or I thought I did.

35:39.325 --> 35:41.525
I just wish...

35:43.462 --> 35:45.129
What?

35:45.231 --> 35:47.231
I could do something
that made a difference.

35:47.333 --> 35:48.999
For our country.

35:49.101 --> 35:51.569
Doesn't that make you
feel proud?

35:51.671 --> 35:54.338
Sometimes.

35:54.440 --> 35:56.674
A lot of the time.

35:56.776 --> 35:58.809
But, you know, what you do
is important, too.

35:58.911 --> 36:00.511
Right.

36:06.853 --> 36:09.320
Can I tell you
something?

36:09.422 --> 36:10.554
Yeah, of course.

36:10.656 --> 36:12.256
Promise you won't laugh?

36:12.358 --> 36:14.124
I promise.

36:15.161 --> 36:17.027
I've been giving it
a lot of thought.

36:17.129 --> 36:19.430
And I just...

36:19.532 --> 36:22.499
I think it's so great
how Philip and Elizabeth

36:22.602 --> 36:24.802
work together
at the travel agency.

36:26.138 --> 36:27.571
Well, I don't know
how together they are.

36:27.673 --> 36:29.006
I mean, she's always off
dealing with

36:29.108 --> 36:30.541
their big corporate clients,
and he's--

36:30.643 --> 36:32.776
Yeah, but I mean they always
have stuff to talk about,

36:32.879 --> 36:34.612
there's never that,
"Oh, how was your day,"

36:34.714 --> 36:37.581
and the other person's
pretending to be interested...

36:37.683 --> 36:40.517
- I'm not pretending.
- I know. I'm just saying...

36:43.155 --> 36:47.558
I think what I'd really like
to do is be an FBI agent.

36:48.861 --> 36:50.995
I think I'd be
really good at it too.

36:53.399 --> 36:55.132
I think you would.

36:55.234 --> 36:56.634
Really?

36:56.736 --> 36:58.469
Yeah.

36:58.571 --> 37:00.104
Yeah.

37:00.206 --> 37:04.108
But, you know, the cutoff age
for new agents is thirty-seven.

37:05.311 --> 37:07.478
Well, they must make
exceptions.

37:07.580 --> 37:09.613
You know everybody, maybe
they can make an exception.

37:09.715 --> 37:13.117
That's not how it works, honey.
I'm sorry.

37:18.858 --> 37:20.791
Hm.

38:28.073 --> 38:29.472
- Tracy Huffs.
- Evan.

38:29.574 --> 38:31.708
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

38:33.145 --> 38:36.346
And, um...
show you this.

38:37.416 --> 38:38.949
- Can I see yours, please?
- Sure.

38:44.456 --> 38:46.690
Thank you.
And thank you for coming.

38:46.792 --> 38:48.892
Please, have a seat.

38:53.098 --> 38:55.098
You're here because
the Altheon security

38:55.200 --> 38:58.668
and compliance department
is conducting a security audit.

38:58.770 --> 39:00.570
You're not here because
you've done anything wrong

39:00.672 --> 39:03.840
or because you've made
any mistake whatsoever.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.109
We're here to evaluate
and make recommendations,

39:06.211 --> 39:07.344
and that's all.

39:07.446 --> 39:09.112
Before we get started,

39:09.214 --> 39:11.881
I need you to sign...

39:11.984 --> 39:14.417
this confidentiality
agreement.

39:14.519 --> 39:18.521
If you could just sign
and initial here

39:18.623 --> 39:20.890
and also here.

39:22.661 --> 39:25.195
Many, but not all,
of the people you work with

39:25.297 --> 39:26.563
will also be asked
to participate

39:26.665 --> 39:29.032
in this security audit
over the next month.

39:29.134 --> 39:32.469
It is imperative that they
not know about it in advance,

39:32.571 --> 39:34.804
and that you not discuss
this with anyone,

39:34.906 --> 39:38.708
even those you think may
have already met with us.

39:40.312 --> 39:41.711
Thank you.

39:41.813 --> 39:43.413
Now...

39:43.515 --> 39:45.582
the purpose
of our meeting here today

39:45.684 --> 39:48.818
is just to identify
any lapses that may exist

39:48.920 --> 39:51.154
with the security procedures
at the warehouse--

39:51.256 --> 39:52.722
or, in those cases

39:52.824 --> 39:54.958
where the procedures
are very well designed,

39:55.060 --> 39:57.460
any ways in which they
aren't being followed.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.996
Please speak freely.
No one will be penalized.

40:00.098 --> 40:03.833
We're here to identify the
problems and then solve them.

40:03.935 --> 40:06.236
I'm gonna take an occasional
note, if that's all right.

40:06.338 --> 40:07.437
Sure.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.172
Let's start
with receiving...

40:09.274 --> 40:10.707
Okay.

40:38.537 --> 40:40.403
Gennadi Bystrov?

40:42.307 --> 40:43.506
Yes?

40:44.876 --> 40:47.677
I understand
you want political asylum.

40:48.647 --> 40:49.979
We have
diplomatic immunity.

40:50.082 --> 40:51.648
I'm not here
to arrest you.

40:51.750 --> 40:54.584
Mr. Bystrov has requested
political asylum.

40:58.757 --> 41:01.524
Yes.
I want asylum.

41:01.626 --> 41:02.992
This way.

41:22.714 --> 41:24.314
Sofia Bystrova.

41:26.618 --> 41:29.419
What is this?
What do you want?

41:29.521 --> 41:32.922
Sofia Bystrova. I understand
you want political asylum.

41:33.024 --> 41:34.991
How dare you!

41:35.093 --> 41:37.460
You have no right
to be here!

41:37.575 --> 41:38.535
_

41:38.619 --> 41:40.039
_

41:40.044 --> 41:40.697
I...

41:40.799 --> 41:42.065
Get out, you get out.

41:42.167 --> 41:43.700
I'm calling our embassy.

41:43.802 --> 41:46.736
Sofia Bystrova, I understand
you want political asylum.

41:53.945 --> 41:55.512
Okay. I'm coming.

41:55.757 --> 41:58.310
_

42:02.622 --> 42:04.622
_

42:04.623 --> 42:06.356
I call embassy!

42:08.793 --> 42:12.862
For all the gold medal readers,
you get two gold stars.

42:12.964 --> 42:15.732
Excuse me. Ilia?

42:15.834 --> 42:19.369
Oh. Come with me, please.
And bring all your things.

42:28.346 --> 42:30.346
Very good.
Thanks.

42:35.687 --> 42:37.387
What happened?

42:37.489 --> 42:39.088
Oh, Gennadi...
I'm sorry...

42:39.191 --> 42:42.892
Sofia...
she told somebody.

42:42.994 --> 42:44.894
What?
What do you mean?

42:44.996 --> 42:47.197
Have a seat.

42:49.234 --> 42:53.102
It was a guy at TASS.
She says she trusts him.

42:53.205 --> 42:56.072
But we couldn't risk
something happening to you.

42:56.174 --> 42:58.241
A man?

42:58.343 --> 42:59.342
Who?

42:59.444 --> 43:02.812
Guy named Bogdan.

43:02.914 --> 43:04.480
You know him?

43:11.122 --> 43:12.488
I'm sorry.

43:16.628 --> 43:19.295
You think she's--

43:19.397 --> 43:20.797
I don't know.

43:20.899 --> 43:24.934
I have--
I have no idea.

43:25.036 --> 43:27.270
But she says
she wants a divorce.

43:27.372 --> 43:29.472
She says this
all the time.

43:38.116 --> 43:39.949
I need to talk to her.

43:40.051 --> 43:41.818
She doesn't want
to talk right now.

43:43.054 --> 43:44.520
You'll both stay
in different places

43:44.623 --> 43:47.590
while we figure out
relocation plans.

43:49.327 --> 43:50.994
What about Ilia?

43:51.096 --> 43:54.631
If she divorce me,
I can still see him, no?

43:57.569 --> 44:01.004
Well, you'll be
in separate locations.

44:01.106 --> 44:04.841
You won't know where she is,
she won't know where you are.

44:04.943 --> 44:06.409
Please. Talk to her.

44:06.511 --> 44:09.846
Gennadi, I can't--
it's not my--

44:09.948 --> 44:12.148
Please, Stan.

44:12.250 --> 44:16.486
You are the only one
who can talk to her, fix this.

44:16.588 --> 44:20.523
I want if we go,
we go together.

44:21.960 --> 44:24.761
Tell her. I love her.

44:24.863 --> 44:26.996
I love Ilia.

44:27.098 --> 44:31.167
I am alone without them...
here... alone.

44:34.272 --> 44:36.506
I'll try.

44:46.217 --> 44:49.218
But that's really only when
we get the military grade stuff.

44:49.321 --> 44:51.754
Other than that, that room
pretty much goes unused.

44:51.856 --> 44:54.590
Um, but right over here is
where they do quality assurance.

44:54.693 --> 44:56.693
That's before
shipping, obviously.

44:56.795 --> 45:00.196
Uh, but when things move from
quality assurance to shipping...

45:00.298 --> 45:02.398
you do sometimes
get uncleared people

45:02.500 --> 45:05.735
having a look
right here and here.

45:05.837 --> 45:08.404
I'm not saying it happens a lot,
I'm not saying it even matters,

45:08.506 --> 45:10.707
but you're asking.

45:10.809 --> 45:13.142
This is exactly
what we need to hear.

45:13.244 --> 45:15.211
It's so easy to fix, too.

45:15.313 --> 45:17.714
This has been so helpful,
Mr. Urqhardt.

45:17.816 --> 45:19.382
Thank you so much.

45:19.484 --> 45:21.918
And I just wanted
to remind you

45:22.020 --> 45:24.487
not to talk to anyone
at work about this.

45:24.589 --> 45:27.490
When people know in advance
about this kind of audit,

45:27.592 --> 45:29.459
it completely skews
our results.

45:29.561 --> 45:31.661
Oh, I get it. I bet my girlfriend
already knows about it.

45:31.763 --> 45:33.229
She works in security.

45:33.331 --> 45:35.932
Oh.
Who's your girlfriend?

45:36.034 --> 45:37.767
Uh, Theresa. Vasquez.

45:37.869 --> 45:40.169
Theresa? She's great...

45:40.271 --> 45:41.671
- Yeah.
- Please.

45:41.773 --> 45:43.940
Thanks.
