WEBVTT

00:02.530 --> 00:03.820
<i>Previously on</i> The Equalizer...

00:04.020 --> 00:05.250
What about we spend some
time training together?

00:05.450 --> 00:06.490
And I'm not just
talking about fighting.

00:06.690 --> 00:07.850
Hey.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.490
Where did you come from?

00:09.690 --> 00:11.160
You have to be hyperaware
of your surroundings

00:11.360 --> 00:12.730
at all times.

00:12.930 --> 00:16.300
Situational awareness,
cornerstone of self-defense.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.030
MAN:
Easy, McCall.

00:18.230 --> 00:19.170
Somebody in
this room

00:19.370 --> 00:21.270
led that hit squad
directly to us.

00:21.470 --> 00:22.670
Now, one of y'all
better start talking.

00:22.870 --> 00:25.300
You are Colton Fisk,
aren't you?

00:25.500 --> 00:26.570
You put my life in danger.

00:26.770 --> 00:27.910
You thought I was a mole.

00:28.110 --> 00:29.110
I needed to find out.

00:29.310 --> 00:31.110
Your arrangement
with the Agency

00:31.310 --> 00:32.280
is under my supervision now.

00:32.480 --> 00:33.280
You work for me.

00:33.480 --> 00:34.710
I don't work for anyone.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.220
You almost
got me killed.

00:36.420 --> 00:37.920
I'm tired of you
manipulating me, Fisk.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.390
Until you're ready to
start dealing with me

00:40.590 --> 00:42.190
openly and honestly, this thing,

00:42.390 --> 00:44.770
me and you, it doesn't work.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.980
(gunfire)
(overlapping shouting)

00:53.350 --> 00:54.370
MEL:
Go, go, go!

00:54.570 --> 00:55.980
(men shouting)

01:16.440 --> 01:17.260
We're pinned.

01:17.460 --> 01:18.320
There's no way out.

01:18.520 --> 01:19.940
What are we
going to do?

01:26.150 --> 01:27.920
* *

01:31.120 --> 01:33.070
(grunting softly)

01:33.270 --> 01:34.460
(strains)

01:38.360 --> 01:40.500
(grunting)

01:46.340 --> 01:47.890
Persistence.

01:48.090 --> 01:49.770
That's what
you taught me, right?

01:51.040 --> 01:52.680
(phone rings)

01:55.510 --> 01:57.100
VI: Robyn, can you hear me?
Hey, Aunt Vi.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.630
Sounds like a party over there.
(music playing loudly)

01:59.830 --> 02:01.130
Well, your daughter insists
on bringing me up to speed

02:01.330 --> 02:02.800
on all
the latest hits.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.100
Yeah, and she's
loving it, Mom.

02:04.300 --> 02:05.470
I don't know
about that.

02:05.670 --> 02:07.010
Why it got to be so
all up in your face

02:07.210 --> 02:08.410
all the time?

02:08.610 --> 02:09.540
What ever happened to
the power of imagination

02:09.740 --> 02:10.810
and suggestion,

02:11.010 --> 02:12.650
you know, like
Earth, Wind & Fire?

02:12.850 --> 02:13.910
ROBYN:
Ooh, the elements.

02:14.110 --> 02:16.280
It's hard to compete
with the classics.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.520
Thank you.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.820
ROBYN: But I do remember
Daddy telling me

02:19.020 --> 02:20.450
how Gran-Gran

02:20.650 --> 02:22.050
called your disco
records the Devil's music.

02:22.260 --> 02:23.860
Why you trying to
be so wise, huh?
Ooh.

02:24.060 --> 02:26.130
That's my job.
Hey, Mom, you sure
we can't pry you away

02:26.330 --> 02:27.790
from the Chevelle
to go shopping

02:27.990 --> 02:29.730
and to the movies with us?
I would love to,

02:29.930 --> 02:32.800
but I have to
pick up some air filters

02:33.000 --> 02:34.500
before the auto parts
store closes.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.270
How about dinner?
DELILAH:
Ooh, yeah, we can, uh,

02:36.470 --> 02:38.240
we can try the new
Peruvian spot downtown?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

02:38.440 --> 02:39.310
ROBYN:
Peruvian?

02:39.510 --> 02:40.910
Try not to fill up on popcorn.

02:41.110 --> 02:43.380
Don't worry.
We won't.
Mm-hmm.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.510
* When you said you
live in a dream *

02:44.710 --> 02:45.980
* We can keep that asleep *

02:46.180 --> 02:47.780
* And you gonna laugh
with all your G's *

02:47.980 --> 02:49.250
* Countin' them sheep,
sheep, sheep, sheep *

02:49.450 --> 02:51.830
* Talking about Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z *

02:54.170 --> 02:55.870
(engine idling)

02:57.240 --> 02:59.040
(chatter in Spanish)

03:04.450 --> 03:06.050
I've got a visual.

03:13.890 --> 03:15.220
<i>Vámanos.</i>

03:16.460 --> 03:17.540
I mean, can you believe

03:17.740 --> 03:18.580
the price of eggs?

03:18.780 --> 03:19.880
I mean, unless

03:20.080 --> 03:21.310
the literal golden
goose laid them...

03:21.510 --> 03:22.350
Heads up. Two men. Five o'clock.

03:22.550 --> 03:23.850
Don't look.

03:24.050 --> 03:25.380
You can't say that
and expect me not to look.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.590
Pretty sure they've
been following us

03:26.790 --> 03:28.050
since we went
into the store.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.620
Well, who do you
think they are?
I don't know,

03:29.820 --> 03:30.790
but my gun's in the car.
We're not gonna make it.

03:30.990 --> 03:31.910

03:59.470 --> 04:02.000

playing)

got to give *

04:47.270 --> 04:50.700

got to give now *

05:31.490 --> 05:33.880
VI:
So, listen.
Load up on snacks.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.300
I'm not paying movie theater
prices for Twizzlers.

06:00.390 --> 06:01.970
All right, coming in hot.

06:02.170 --> 06:03.110
Mm-hmm.

06:03.310 --> 06:04.140
(grunts)

06:04.340 --> 06:06.780
Life was safer when I was dead.

06:06.980 --> 06:09.350
I got your text.
Everything okay?

06:09.550 --> 06:11.550
Well, we lost a good
can of soup, but yeah.

06:11.750 --> 06:12.750
How about you?
Good, considering

06:12.950 --> 06:14.250
I had to fight off
three assassins.

06:14.450 --> 06:16.220
Three? We only got two.
Now I'm insulted.

06:16.420 --> 06:18.460
So this was
a coordinated attack.

06:18.660 --> 06:19.530
Yes, but
by whom?

06:19.730 --> 06:20.990
Come on, let's go downstairs.

06:21.190 --> 06:24.110
I want to try pulling
footage of the attacks.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.150
HARRY:
What the hell?

06:31.050 --> 06:32.910
MAN:
Nice place.

06:33.110 --> 06:35.290
It could use
a pool table, though.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.160
ROBYN:
Fisk.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.930
* *

06:52.610 --> 06:54.760
Keshegian.
Taller than I thought.

06:54.960 --> 06:55.960
HARRY:
You're sitting
in my chair.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.560
FISK:
It's comfy.

06:57.760 --> 06:58.300
Mel, right?

06:58.500 --> 06:59.700
Small package,

06:59.900 --> 07:00.630
big punch.

07:00.830 --> 07:01.800
You've got a lot of nerve,

07:02.000 --> 07:03.570
breaking in here.
Yeah,
about that,

07:03.770 --> 07:06.000
you might want to look into
your security measures.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.410
MEL:
Oh, yeah? You might
want to rethink

07:07.610 --> 07:08.840
that stupid grin
on your face

07:09.040 --> 07:10.840
because after everything
you've put her through,

07:11.040 --> 07:13.410
the lies, putting our lives
in danger, I ought to just...

07:13.610 --> 07:15.600
We were attacked,
and then you show up.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.750
What's going on, Fisk?

07:17.950 --> 07:19.080
I picked up some chatter

07:19.280 --> 07:20.350
that someone was
looking for a woman

07:20.550 --> 07:21.550
who fit your description.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.920
That's it?
That's your crack intel?

07:24.120 --> 07:26.320
No, but it piqued my interest.

07:26.530 --> 07:27.560
Is he... Oh, my...
No, no, no, no.

07:27.760 --> 07:28.660
You can't...
No, no, no, no, no.

07:28.860 --> 07:30.160
You got to get out
of the chair.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.850
Okay. Okay, take it easy.
Out of the chair.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.600
So, I did some digging,

07:34.800 --> 07:36.520
and I found
this.

07:45.530 --> 07:47.680
Any idea who's behind this?

07:47.880 --> 07:49.250
FISK:
No.

07:49.450 --> 07:50.950
What about your assailants?
Any distinguishing features?

07:51.150 --> 07:53.250
Masked up.
HARRY: Nothing
that stood out.

07:53.450 --> 07:55.220
MEL:
Well-trained,
that's for sure.

07:55.420 --> 07:57.770
One of them tried
to stick me with this.

08:04.410 --> 08:05.780
Bitter.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.800
I think it's midazolam.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.200
A knock-out drug used on
patients before surgery.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.610
So they weren't
trying to kill us.

08:12.810 --> 08:13.770
They were trying to abduct us.

08:13.970 --> 08:15.670
FISK:
Maybe.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.310
But whatever's
in this serum

08:17.510 --> 08:19.240
is not pure midazolam.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.410
Any idea what else is in it?

08:21.610 --> 08:23.950
No.
I know someone
who might.

08:24.150 --> 08:24.980
Jakob.

08:25.180 --> 08:26.550
Huh?

08:26.750 --> 08:28.050
He runs a
makeshift lab

08:28.250 --> 08:29.450
out of his
basement uptown.

08:29.660 --> 08:30.720
What kind of lab?

08:30.920 --> 08:32.320
The illegal kind,
which is exactly why

08:32.520 --> 08:33.760
he might know what's in that.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.260
Yeah, if he didn't make it
himself.
Yeah.

08:35.460 --> 08:36.600
FISK: I'll check into
things on my end.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.600
Guys, this is right
across the street

08:38.800 --> 08:40.530
from where you were attacked,
at the auto shop.

08:40.730 --> 08:41.870
Yeah, that looks like the van

08:42.070 --> 08:43.570
that was following
me this morning.

08:43.770 --> 08:44.670
HARRY: Okay, all I got to do
is reverse trace it

08:44.870 --> 08:46.370
back to its point of departure.

08:46.570 --> 08:47.640
I can do a little recon
while you guys check out

08:47.840 --> 08:49.810
the pharmacist.
Wait, I don't know, babe.

08:50.010 --> 08:50.810
What? I'll pick up

08:51.010 --> 08:52.340
some cans of soup.
I'm serious.

08:52.540 --> 08:55.250
Okay, if you go, bring a gun,
but don't engage.

08:55.450 --> 08:56.580
Call that Dante.

08:56.780 --> 08:58.150
He can
handle himself

08:58.350 --> 09:01.670
pretty well.
I'll be in touch.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.030
ROBYN: <i>You have</i>
<i>a split second to evaluate</i>

09:12.230 --> 09:14.020
<i>whether that signifies a threat.</i>

09:16.850 --> 09:18.200
(mutters)

09:18.400 --> 09:19.810
We have to go now.

09:20.010 --> 09:21.370
No, relax. We've got 30 minutes

09:21.570 --> 09:23.180
before that movie starts.
I'll explain outside,

09:23.380 --> 09:24.880
but we have to go now.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.010
Are you okay?
Did something happen?

09:27.210 --> 09:28.380
Not yet, but I think
there's a man up front

09:28.580 --> 09:29.820
about to
rob the store.

09:30.020 --> 09:31.630
There's an exit
sign behind you.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.120
It's locked.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.140
There's only one way out.

09:42.310 --> 09:43.810
Okay.

09:46.980 --> 09:48.020
Next.

09:53.120 --> 09:53.970
Is that him?

09:54.170 --> 09:55.140
DELILAH:
Mm-hmm.

09:55.340 --> 09:56.310
VI:
Let's go. Stay close.

09:56.510 --> 09:58.060
Stay calm.

10:01.860 --> 10:04.520
Empty the register.
Empty the register!

10:04.720 --> 10:06.020
Empty the register now!

10:06.220 --> 10:07.670
And the safe.

10:09.270 --> 10:11.810
Anybody moves, people will die!

10:16.110 --> 10:18.260
(bluesy music playing)

10:18.460 --> 10:19.880
(door opens)

10:24.120 --> 10:26.140
Hey, Dante.

10:26.340 --> 10:28.040
Harry.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.310
What are you doing here?

10:29.510 --> 10:30.640
I tried calling you
a bunch of times,

10:30.840 --> 10:32.510
but I, uh, I guess
your ringer was off.

10:32.710 --> 10:34.750
So you tracked my phone.

10:34.950 --> 10:38.020
Yeah, sorry. Desperate times.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.050
Desperation and drinks.

10:39.250 --> 10:40.950
Perfect timing.

10:41.150 --> 10:42.490
Yo.

10:42.690 --> 10:44.560
BARTENDER:
Coming up.

10:44.760 --> 10:45.990
Yeah, I got to say,
it's not exactly

10:46.190 --> 10:48.590
where I expected
to find you at, well,

10:48.790 --> 10:49.960
this early in the day.

10:50.160 --> 10:53.170
It's 5:00 somewhere.
Perks of suspension.

10:53.370 --> 10:55.500
Suspen... What happened?

10:55.700 --> 10:56.870
I was doing my job,
that's what happened.

10:57.070 --> 10:59.070
Wait, is this about
that guy that shot

10:59.270 --> 11:00.570
your pal Manny?
I was
bringing him in,

11:00.770 --> 11:02.010
doing the right thing, you know?

11:02.210 --> 11:04.740
Seems that doesn't
count for much these days.

11:04.940 --> 11:07.380
I'm sorry,
that's super messed up.

11:07.580 --> 11:10.200
I mean, we are
the good guys, right?

11:11.370 --> 11:12.350
Maybe my dad was right.

11:12.550 --> 11:13.950
Things are stacked against us.

11:14.150 --> 11:15.620
Hey, look, I get
you're going through

11:15.820 --> 11:16.960
some tough stuff
right now,

11:17.160 --> 11:19.420
but I-I could really
use your help.

11:19.620 --> 11:20.690
With what?

11:20.890 --> 11:23.230
Some pretty
hardcore mercs came after

11:23.430 --> 11:25.200
me, Mel and Rob this morning.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.430
Robyn?

11:27.630 --> 11:29.170
Is she okay? And you?

11:29.370 --> 11:31.200
Mel?
Yeah. Well,
I mean, we're okay.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.340
That could
change, though,

11:32.540 --> 11:33.470
unless we figure out

11:33.670 --> 11:34.970
who's coming for us and-and why.

11:35.170 --> 11:36.310
Any leads?

11:36.510 --> 11:38.040
I tracked a van to
some spot in Brooklyn,

11:38.240 --> 11:39.910
but, you know,
I promised the ladies

11:40.110 --> 11:42.750
I wouldn't go without backup,
so what do you say?

11:42.950 --> 11:44.480
Perks of suspension.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.050
I got nothing
but time.

11:46.250 --> 11:47.790
Besides, I could
use the distraction.

11:47.990 --> 11:50.810
Coffee to go, please. Black.
BARTENDER: Okay.

11:52.570 --> 11:53.990
ROBYN:
Jakob.

11:54.190 --> 11:55.360
What the...

11:55.560 --> 11:57.630
I thought we had a deal.
I made you those paralytics.

11:57.830 --> 11:59.700
In exchange, you don't
come around here anymore.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.000
Yes, but I need to know

12:01.200 --> 12:02.530
what's in
this syringe.
I don't know

12:02.730 --> 12:03.440
what the hell that is
and don't care.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.300
Last time you were here,

12:05.500 --> 12:06.440
I-I was in the
hospital for a week.

12:06.640 --> 12:07.670
I don't think he
wants to help us.

12:07.870 --> 12:08.610
No, and he barely looked
at that syringe,

12:08.810 --> 12:09.610
which means he definitely

12:09.810 --> 12:10.510
knows something
about it.

12:10.710 --> 12:11.510
I don't know what it is,

12:11.710 --> 12:12.810
and I don't care.

12:13.010 --> 12:14.010
Now, for the last time...

12:14.210 --> 12:15.610
Ow!

12:15.810 --> 12:17.120
You remember something now?

12:17.320 --> 12:18.680
The antidote, the antidote,
I need the antidote.

12:18.880 --> 12:19.720
MEL: Oh, I think you
jogged his memory, Rob.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.590
Okay, it's
a mixture.

12:21.790 --> 12:24.360
A cocktail of midazolam
and scopolamine.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.620
Scopolamine. What is that?

12:25.820 --> 12:27.190
Cranks up your autonomic
nervous system

12:27.390 --> 12:28.930
so much, your body
goes on autopilot.

12:29.130 --> 12:31.230
Decision-making is inhibited.

12:31.430 --> 12:32.930
You answer as asked,

12:33.130 --> 12:34.770
you do as
your told.
It's a truth serum.

12:34.970 --> 12:36.750
You become completely
compliant, until...

12:37.590 --> 12:39.400
Until what?
If you don't counteract it,

12:39.600 --> 12:41.240
your nervous system burns out.

12:41.440 --> 12:44.210
Your body literally
forgets how to function.

12:44.410 --> 12:47.710
You can't breathe, your heart
stops beating after 90 minutes.

12:47.910 --> 12:48.980
If those guys this morning

12:49.180 --> 12:51.120
were trying to inject me
with truth serum,

12:51.320 --> 12:53.050
they want some information.
But what?

12:53.250 --> 12:55.020
Well, between your military
and CIA experience,

12:55.220 --> 12:56.450
could be anything.
The antidote,

12:56.650 --> 12:57.720
I need the antidote.
It's in that cabinet

12:57.920 --> 12:59.360
right over there. Please,
MEL: All right.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.360
please, please.
Calm, calm.
You're so emotional.

13:01.560 --> 13:02.590
Give it to me, please.
Wait, wait. This one?
You want this?

13:02.790 --> 13:03.430
Yes.
I'm gonna hang on to it.

13:03.630 --> 13:05.430
Come on.
Shut up.

13:05.630 --> 13:06.700
Who'd you sell it to?

13:06.900 --> 13:08.670
Anonymous buyer.
I swear.

13:08.870 --> 13:09.840
I think he needs another dose.

13:10.040 --> 13:10.900
No, no, no. Okay, okay, okay.

13:11.100 --> 13:12.810
They had some type of accent.

13:13.010 --> 13:15.340
Cuban? South American?
I don't know.

13:15.540 --> 13:16.740
That's all I know.

13:16.940 --> 13:19.080
(crying): Now, please,
I don't want to die.

13:19.280 --> 13:20.480
ROBYN:
Ah, relax.

13:20.680 --> 13:22.630
It's just saline and whiskey.
You'll be fine.

13:23.930 --> 13:26.120
This is the serum
that you made, you genius.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.490
ROBYN:
But if I find out you lied,
I'm gonna come back here

13:28.690 --> 13:31.140
and give you the real deal.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.020
Hurry up.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.020
Hurry up.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.790
(police sirens wail)
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

13:51.990 --> 13:54.210
Nobody's coming in

13:54.410 --> 13:55.930
or getting out.

13:59.970 --> 14:01.590
DANTE:
Looks like you were right.

14:01.790 --> 14:03.390
Here's your van.

14:03.590 --> 14:05.690
So, uh,
what's the plan?

14:05.890 --> 14:07.410
DANTE:
Stay on my six.

14:17.650 --> 14:19.350
Could be squatters.

14:23.560 --> 14:24.640
You recognize that symbol?

14:24.840 --> 14:27.100
No, Rob might,
though.

14:31.270 --> 14:32.280
(phone rings)

14:32.480 --> 14:33.550
What'd you
find, Harry?

14:33.750 --> 14:34.890
HARRY:
Hey, uh, so the van's here,

14:35.090 --> 14:36.750
but the place is empty.
I just texted you

14:36.960 --> 14:37.890
a picture of a symbol.

14:38.090 --> 14:39.560
Does that mean anything to you?

14:39.760 --> 14:41.760
It's the symbol for the
Venezuelan freedom fighters,

14:41.960 --> 14:43.800
soldiers
I was helping

14:44.000 --> 14:45.400
fight Alexander Montilla.

14:45.600 --> 14:46.830
Montilla?

14:47.030 --> 14:48.970
He was a ruthless dictator
and mass murderer,

14:49.170 --> 14:50.870
heinous human rights violations.

14:51.070 --> 14:52.640
And we almost
took him down,

14:52.840 --> 14:54.140
until the U.S. changed its mind,

14:54.340 --> 14:55.810
and the CIA withdrew overnight.

14:56.010 --> 14:59.340
Leaving those freedom fighters
to his mercy.

14:59.540 --> 15:01.280
No equipment, no ammo.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.510
We betrayed them.

15:02.710 --> 15:04.380
Left them there to die.

15:04.580 --> 15:07.050
I lost my whole unit
in the extraction.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.050
Watched two of
my best friends,

15:09.250 --> 15:12.870
Ed and Michelle,
get blown to pieces.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.840
Sorry to hear that.

15:18.010 --> 15:19.200
Michelle and I

15:19.400 --> 15:22.280
came up through
the Farm together.

15:23.150 --> 15:25.440
Thought we could
change the world.

15:25.640 --> 15:27.010
Okay, so if
the freedom fighters

15:27.210 --> 15:27.970
are here,

15:28.170 --> 15:29.370
could this be a revenge mission?

15:29.570 --> 15:31.080
ROBYN:
I mean, I couldn't blame them.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.440
But why now?

15:32.640 --> 15:33.980
And why us?

15:34.180 --> 15:35.200
HARRY:
Yeah, Mel and I
weren't even there.

15:36.630 --> 15:37.920
But Bishop was.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.550
And if Bishop was there,

15:39.750 --> 15:40.950
then his protégée
probably was, too.

15:41.150 --> 15:43.290
Fisk. Which means
he probably

15:43.490 --> 15:44.760
knows more about this
than he's letting on.

15:44.960 --> 15:45.890
One way to find out.

15:46.090 --> 15:46.890
Hey, we'll call you back.

15:47.090 --> 15:48.630
Time to pay Fisk a visit.

15:48.830 --> 15:49.760
Have fun with that.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.300
We better jet.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.320
Last thing I need
is a trespassing charge.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.300
(yells)

16:17.370 --> 16:18.870
Ah!

16:20.610 --> 16:22.040
(grunting)

16:34.360 --> 16:35.670
You okay?

16:35.870 --> 16:37.490
Better than him.

16:44.300 --> 16:45.330
What?

16:47.500 --> 16:48.800
Dante.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.970
Dante. Dante!

16:57.780 --> 16:59.530
HARRY: Can you hear me? Come on.
Okay, we're gonna get you

16:59.730 --> 17:01.270
fixed up. Come on,
we're gonna get you some help.

17:01.470 --> 17:03.900
Just stay awake.
(line rings)

17:04.100 --> 17:05.070
(phone rings)

17:05.270 --> 17:06.200
Hey, babe.
Everything okay?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.510
HARRY:
Well, that depends.

17:07.710 --> 17:08.540
Dante just got
stabbed with a syringe

17:08.740 --> 17:09.540
full of maybe the same stuff

17:09.740 --> 17:11.680
they almost hit Rob with.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.550
Damn. We have the antidote,

17:13.750 --> 17:14.710
but we're already too far away.

17:14.910 --> 17:16.150
(slowly):
Is that Robyn?

17:16.350 --> 17:19.020
Hey, girl.
How you doing?

17:19.220 --> 17:20.650
Robyn has such
a great smile.

17:20.850 --> 17:22.020
Doesn't she have
a great smile, Harry?

17:22.220 --> 17:23.320
HARRY:
Yes, she does.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.820
Uh, hey, what else
was in that stuff?

17:25.020 --> 17:26.020
A very powerful

17:26.220 --> 17:26.990
truth serum.

17:27.190 --> 17:29.260
Okay, that follows.

17:29.460 --> 17:31.630
And her eyes. You could get lost

17:31.830 --> 17:34.170
in those eyes.
Like pools of warm,

17:34.370 --> 17:35.830
soothing water you just

17:36.030 --> 17:37.600
want to dive
right in.
Uh-huh.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.470
What's he saying?
HARRY:
Nothing, it's fine.

17:39.670 --> 17:40.540
Listen, I got to take him
to a hospital, okay?

17:40.740 --> 17:41.970
There's one ten minutes away.

17:42.170 --> 17:43.680
No, no, no, no.
You have to take him to Jakob's.

17:43.880 --> 17:46.040
If Dante doesn't get the
antidote in the next 90 minutes,

17:46.240 --> 17:48.250
his heart will stop.
I'll text you the address.

17:48.450 --> 17:50.150
It's in a cabinet in the back.

17:50.350 --> 17:51.320
Okay, copy that.

17:51.520 --> 17:52.550
Where's Robyn?
Where'd Robyn go?

17:52.750 --> 17:54.290
I want to see her.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.090
Okay. Hold on, Romeo.

17:56.290 --> 17:57.670
(tires screeching)

18:00.010 --> 18:01.780
(ship horn blows)

18:05.710 --> 18:06.600
ROBYN:
What do you know

18:06.800 --> 18:07.700
that you're not telling us?

18:07.900 --> 18:09.000
All right, slow down, mall cop.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.240
What are you talking about?

18:10.440 --> 18:11.840
Dante got hit with
one of those syringes.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.910
It's a truth serum,
and it's lethal,

18:14.110 --> 18:14.940
so I need to know

18:15.140 --> 18:17.410
everything you know about

18:17.610 --> 18:18.440
why Venezuelan
soldiers are here.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.500
Venezuela?

18:21.430 --> 18:24.050
Look, I don't have
all the answers,

18:24.250 --> 18:26.180
but yesterday, my personal
servers were hit

18:26.380 --> 18:29.220
with a cyberattack in
an attempt to smoke me out.

18:29.420 --> 18:31.620
Which you conveniently left out.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.640
I didn't have
all the information yet.

18:34.810 --> 18:36.060
After I repelled the incursion,

18:36.260 --> 18:38.830
my security systems
picked up the chatter

18:39.030 --> 18:40.300
about you
and your team.

18:40.500 --> 18:41.700
So they figured if they grab me,

18:41.900 --> 18:43.500
I could tell them
how to find you.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.040
But what
made them think

18:45.240 --> 18:46.720
I would know where you are?

18:50.020 --> 18:51.010
I'm sorry, McCall,

18:51.210 --> 18:53.480
but I'm afraid I might've

18:53.680 --> 18:55.350
brought this
onto you.

18:55.550 --> 18:57.060
You mentioned
Venezuelan soldiers?

19:01.070 --> 19:03.440
Vargas. God.

19:04.410 --> 19:05.090
Someone want to fill me in?

19:05.290 --> 19:06.890
Enrique Vargas.

19:07.090 --> 19:09.360
He was the leader of
the Venezuelan freedom fighters.

19:09.560 --> 19:12.030
Worked closely with the CIA.

19:12.230 --> 19:14.470
I was his contact.
He trusted me.

19:14.670 --> 19:15.800
Yeah, his first mistake.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.370
We went in with
the right intentions,

19:17.570 --> 19:19.370
but then the orders came in,
and we had to pull out.

19:19.570 --> 19:21.720
Soon after we...

19:23.060 --> 19:24.380
...abandoned them,

19:24.580 --> 19:26.810
Vargas' friends and family,

19:27.010 --> 19:30.250
they... they were
rounded up and executed

19:30.450 --> 19:31.820
by Montilla.

19:32.020 --> 19:33.750
Vargas survived,
and he's been leading

19:33.950 --> 19:35.750
an underground
rebel group ever since,

19:35.950 --> 19:39.690
but he holds me accountable
for the deaths of his people.

19:39.890 --> 19:41.990
(scoffs) Iran, Afghanistan.

19:42.190 --> 19:44.230
How many times
has the CIA done this?

19:44.430 --> 19:46.330
Sounds like this guy
was right to blame you.

19:46.530 --> 19:48.030
CIA only cares about the game,

19:48.230 --> 19:49.520
not the players.

19:50.290 --> 19:53.210
Not even our own operatives
who we've lost down there.

19:53.410 --> 19:55.410
Michelle Chambers and Ed Lee

19:55.610 --> 19:56.970
were outstanding
agents.

19:57.170 --> 19:58.380
I know how you
felt about them.

19:58.580 --> 19:59.740
I'm truly sorry.

19:59.940 --> 20:01.950
But that's not
what's relevant right now.

20:02.150 --> 20:05.120
Vargas is extremely dangerous,
and we need to take him down.

20:05.320 --> 20:06.450
Did you say "we"?

20:06.650 --> 20:07.820
Because this sounds like
a "you" problem.

20:08.020 --> 20:11.740
Vargas will not stop
coming after me. Or you.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.060
You want help?
Call your buddies at the CIA.

20:16.260 --> 20:18.630
The CIA has never acknowledged
what happened in Venezuela,

20:18.830 --> 20:20.600
and they won't start now.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.030
ROBYN:
And that's exactly
why I left.

20:22.230 --> 20:23.990
Either you have
your people's back or you don't.

20:25.590 --> 20:27.620
Good luck, Fisk.

20:35.660 --> 20:37.630
(tires screech)

20:40.170 --> 20:41.050
(grunting)

20:41.250 --> 20:42.390
FISK:
McCall!

20:42.590 --> 20:44.070
ROBYN:
Come on,
they got Fisk.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.210
Get in the back!

20:48.840 --> 20:50.650
(tires screeching)

20:57.350 --> 20:58.770
ROBYN:
<i>I knew something was off.</i>

20:58.970 --> 21:00.000
Fisk rarely leaves
himself this exposed.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.740
You think he got
nabbed on purpose?

21:01.940 --> 21:03.070
You heard him,
he wants me involved.

21:03.270 --> 21:04.440
And he knew I couldn't

21:04.640 --> 21:05.880
stand by and let that happen.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.550
Well, what if he was wrong?
What can I say?

21:07.750 --> 21:09.210
Love him or hate him,

21:09.410 --> 21:10.930
the man knows people.

21:11.700 --> 21:12.620
Rob.
I see it.

21:12.820 --> 21:13.850
Just get me close.

21:14.050 --> 21:15.550
I'll blow
their tires out.
Wait.

21:15.750 --> 21:16.750
If they wanted
him dead,

21:16.950 --> 21:17.790
they'd have killed him by now.

21:17.990 --> 21:19.160
And if we
stop them,

21:19.360 --> 21:21.490
we may never find Vargas.

21:21.690 --> 21:25.430
But if we follow them
to their hive,

21:25.630 --> 21:27.100
we can take them all down.

21:27.300 --> 21:29.120
All right.

21:31.250 --> 21:32.620
You're too good for Fisk.

21:33.390 --> 21:35.940
Hey, Dante. Just hang in there.
Just hang in there.

21:36.140 --> 21:37.480
(echoing): Stay with me.
You're doing great, buddy.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.210
Just stay with me, okay?

21:39.410 --> 21:41.410
You're a good
guy, Harry.

21:41.610 --> 21:42.580
Thanks, pal.

21:42.780 --> 21:44.350
My father
always said

21:44.550 --> 21:46.420
good was just a construct,

21:46.620 --> 21:47.890
for simple-minded people

21:48.090 --> 21:49.890
who couldn't see shades of gray.

21:50.090 --> 21:51.520
Hmm.
What do
you think?

21:51.720 --> 21:52.920
Uh...
(phone rings)

21:53.120 --> 21:54.230
Ah, saved by the bell. Hey.

21:54.430 --> 21:55.490
MEL:
How's Dante?

21:55.690 --> 21:56.930
Channeling his inner
Jim Morrison.

21:57.130 --> 21:58.360
Look, we're only a few
blocks away from Jakob's.

21:58.560 --> 21:59.500
Did you talk to Fisk?

21:59.700 --> 22:01.270
Yeah, right before
he got grabbed.

22:01.470 --> 22:03.100
Grabbed? (sighs)

22:03.300 --> 22:04.800
What is going on today?
Tracking
the van now.

22:05.000 --> 22:05.840
You focus on Dante,

22:06.040 --> 22:07.710
we'll circle back after.

22:07.910 --> 22:08.840
All right.
Robyn.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.040
She showed me
things about myself

22:11.240 --> 22:13.180
I didn't even
know were there.

22:13.380 --> 22:15.350
Showed me
that justice

22:15.550 --> 22:16.930
wasn't so
black and white.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.800
(sighs) I love her for that.

22:22.340 --> 22:23.520
Did he just say...

22:23.720 --> 22:24.890
HARRY:
No, he's good.
I don't know.

22:25.090 --> 22:26.920
It's just the radio.

22:27.120 --> 22:29.290
W-W-We're two seconds away.
We'll call you back.

22:29.490 --> 22:30.530
(door opens)

22:30.730 --> 22:32.500
HARRY:
Hello? Hello?

22:32.700 --> 22:34.470
DANTE:
Maybe they're
playing a game?
Jakob?

22:34.670 --> 22:36.000
Like hide-and-seek.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.670
Okay. Easy there,
big guy.

22:38.870 --> 22:40.170
We break it,
we buy it.

22:40.370 --> 22:41.570
Jakob?

22:41.770 --> 22:43.540
Anybody there?

22:43.740 --> 22:44.540
You know who's always there?

22:44.740 --> 22:45.810
Robyn.

22:46.010 --> 22:48.510
She's my ride-or-die.

22:48.710 --> 22:50.750
HARRY:
Oh, no. No.

22:50.950 --> 22:54.090
They must have found out
he told Rob about the serum.

22:54.290 --> 22:55.650
Call Robyn,
she'll know what to do.

22:55.850 --> 22:57.670
She always knows.

22:59.110 --> 23:01.690
(police sirens wailing)
(helicopter whirring)

23:01.890 --> 23:03.630
(phone rings)
(gasps)

23:03.830 --> 23:04.760
Who is that?

23:04.960 --> 23:06.930
(rings)
Who the hell is that?

23:07.130 --> 23:08.830
Maybe you should answer that.

23:09.030 --> 23:11.570
It could be the cops.
They probably want to find

23:11.770 --> 23:12.700
a safe way out of this.

23:12.900 --> 23:13.710
Yeah, like hell
they do.

23:13.910 --> 23:15.270
Shut up, stop ringing!

23:15.470 --> 23:17.510
Would you like me
to answer it?

23:17.710 --> 23:19.030
No!
(rings)

23:21.000 --> 23:23.350
Sir, if you don't
answer the phone,

23:23.550 --> 23:24.680
the cops are gonna come in here,

23:24.880 --> 23:25.950
and it's gonna get
a lot worse for you.

23:26.150 --> 23:28.190
I know you don't want that.

23:28.390 --> 23:29.450
None of us do.

23:29.650 --> 23:31.420
But whatever
led you here today,

23:31.620 --> 23:33.090
it's not too late
to turn back.

23:33.290 --> 23:35.990
I promise you, whatever
happened in the past,

23:36.190 --> 23:38.430
you still have
a lot to live for.

23:38.630 --> 23:41.370
You see, I did everything right.

23:41.570 --> 23:44.070
I was loyal and I worked hard,
and you know what it got me?

23:44.270 --> 23:47.000
Discarded like
a piece of trash!

23:47.200 --> 23:50.240
So, don't tell me that I got
something to live for,

23:50.440 --> 23:52.230
'cause I don't.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.760
(police sirens wailing)

23:57.970 --> 23:59.300
(gate opening)

24:06.340 --> 24:07.690
(gate closes)

24:07.890 --> 24:09.460
MEL:
So what's our move?
Try to infiltrate?

24:09.660 --> 24:11.700
No, we're gonna need

24:11.900 --> 24:13.130
backup
for this.
Who?

24:13.330 --> 24:14.870
You heard Fisk, the CIA's
not gonna touch this.

24:15.070 --> 24:17.150
That doesn't mean
we're out of options.

24:21.220 --> 24:22.490
Rob, movement.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.290
We've been made. Hold on.

24:26.860 --> 24:29.260
(coughing)

24:32.770 --> 24:34.100
ROBYN:
Michelle.

24:43.310 --> 24:45.830
Mel? Mel!

24:46.030 --> 24:47.800
Mel, wake up.
(groans)

24:48.000 --> 24:49.450
There you go.

24:50.480 --> 24:51.750
You okay?

24:53.150 --> 24:55.970
Yeah, aside from
being gassed

24:56.170 --> 24:58.980
and, you know,
tied to a chair, I'm peachy.

24:59.180 --> 25:01.810
This is gonna sound crazy, but
I think I just saw Michelle.

25:02.010 --> 25:03.650
Michelle Chambers,

25:03.850 --> 25:05.750
who was killed
in Venezuela?

25:05.950 --> 25:08.150
That's the crazy part.
Back at the car,

25:08.350 --> 25:09.940
right before I passed out...

25:11.110 --> 25:12.320
I think I saw her.

25:12.520 --> 25:14.290
I don't know,

25:14.490 --> 25:15.390
maybe I was hallucinating.

25:15.590 --> 25:16.530
Makes sense, you know?

25:16.730 --> 25:18.200
She was on your mind.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.400
Plus the gas.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.030
It seemed so real.

25:21.230 --> 25:22.330
(man screaming)

25:22.530 --> 25:24.300
Is that Fisk?
Yeah,

25:24.500 --> 25:26.840
and I'm starting to suspect this
is about more than just revenge.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.410
They were using us
to get to Fisk.

25:28.610 --> 25:31.240
Why are we still alive?

25:31.440 --> 25:33.040
I'm not waiting around
to find out.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.980
HARRY:
Okay, okay, okay.

25:35.180 --> 25:36.380
It's got to be here.
Got to be here.

25:36.580 --> 25:38.250
W-Where-- what
did Mel say?

25:38.450 --> 25:39.620
Back wall, back wall, back wall.

25:39.820 --> 25:41.490
How you doing, pal?
You doing good?

25:41.690 --> 25:43.520
(slurring):
I'm not doing so great.

25:43.720 --> 25:45.060
HARRY:
It's not here.

25:45.260 --> 25:47.260
Oh. No, no, no, no, no.

25:47.460 --> 25:48.760
Pal, pal, pal. Wake up.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.330
Wait. Dante.
Come on, come on.

25:50.530 --> 25:53.010
Don't do this.
Okay. Okay. (grunting)

25:53.780 --> 25:56.000
There's got to be a pulse.
There's got to be a pulse.

25:56.200 --> 25:57.520
Oh, come on.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.210
There's got to be
a quick-start guide, right?

26:03.410 --> 26:04.410
I can't read
upside down.

26:04.610 --> 26:06.880
You're good,
you're good, you're good.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.510
You're good, you're good.
Here we go.

26:08.710 --> 26:10.280
Here we go.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.250
Okay, okay. Sorry about this.

26:12.450 --> 26:13.840
No pain,
no gain, right?

26:14.570 --> 26:16.050
Come on, pal.
(thumps)

26:16.250 --> 26:17.890
(high-pitched whining)
Breathe. Breathe.

26:18.090 --> 26:19.220
Come on.
(thumps, heart beats)

26:19.420 --> 26:21.190
(gasps)
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

26:21.390 --> 26:24.000
You okay?

26:24.200 --> 26:25.660
Never better.
Okay.

26:25.860 --> 26:26.930
Yeah. Are you okay?

26:27.130 --> 26:28.230
Yeah, I'm good.

26:28.430 --> 26:30.620
I'm good. I think
my heart stopped. (laughs)

26:37.090 --> 26:39.760
(distant sirens wailing)

26:43.060 --> 26:44.250
I'm sorry for what you're
going through.

26:44.450 --> 26:46.720
What do you know about it?

26:46.920 --> 26:48.420
I know you're hurting.

26:48.620 --> 26:50.250
The clothes,

26:50.450 --> 26:52.920
the nonperishable items
in your-in your basket.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.890
Wool socks

26:55.090 --> 26:56.060
that you took.

26:56.260 --> 26:58.950
Keeping your feet
warm and dry is...

27:00.210 --> 27:03.020
...is important when
you don't have...

27:04.790 --> 27:08.190
...when you don't have
a home to sleep in.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.080
Yeah.

27:11.280 --> 27:13.040
I'm homeless.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.280
So?

27:14.480 --> 27:15.910
You think that makes you
better than me?

27:16.110 --> 27:16.750
No.

27:16.950 --> 27:17.750
Nothing
could be

27:17.950 --> 27:20.000
further from the truth.

27:27.370 --> 27:29.430
You have a wife.

27:29.630 --> 27:30.850
Your ring.

27:33.250 --> 27:34.650
Had.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.270
You spend your whole
life at the plant,

27:37.470 --> 27:38.870
and you're making
the steel beams

27:39.070 --> 27:41.970
for the buildings and the
bridges all over the city.

27:42.170 --> 27:43.440
And then suddenly,

27:43.640 --> 27:46.710
almost overnight,
everything changes.

27:46.910 --> 27:48.830
It becomes more automated.

27:50.900 --> 27:52.320
Suddenly they don't
need so many guys

27:52.520 --> 27:54.490
with my skill set.

27:54.690 --> 27:56.020
So, you lost your job?

27:56.220 --> 28:00.070
What am I gonna do?
Too old to learn a new trade.

28:01.410 --> 28:02.530
So, yeah,

28:02.730 --> 28:04.500
she left me.

28:04.700 --> 28:07.460
But I don't even blame her.

28:07.660 --> 28:09.530
I couldn't take...

28:09.730 --> 28:12.620
I couldn't take care
of her anymore.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.990
But she believed in me.

28:17.730 --> 28:20.810
Kind of like I believed in
the American dream.

28:21.010 --> 28:23.300
So, it turns out
we were both fools.

28:24.130 --> 28:26.920
I spent my life doing
everything right.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.840
People act like I'm invisible.

28:33.470 --> 28:35.240
(sighs)

28:40.750 --> 28:42.180
I see you.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.240
I'm Viola.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.240
What's your name?

28:49.440 --> 28:50.740
Drake.

28:50.940 --> 28:53.090
I'm sorry, Drake.

28:54.330 --> 28:55.810
You deserve better.

28:56.010 --> 28:57.750
OFFICER (over loudspeaker):
To the man inside

28:57.950 --> 29:01.190
holding hostages,
we have tried to make contact.

29:01.390 --> 29:03.860
Come out now and surrender,
or let the hostages go free.

29:04.060 --> 29:06.090
Sir, please consider
surrendering.

29:06.290 --> 29:07.980
They might shoot
you if you don't.

29:09.410 --> 29:11.250
Maybe that's for the best.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.800
Help! Please, help!

29:16.000 --> 29:18.040
She's not breathing.

29:18.240 --> 29:19.470
Help!

29:19.670 --> 29:21.310
I don't know what the hell
you people did to her.

29:21.510 --> 29:22.970
You have to
help her.

29:23.170 --> 29:24.990
She...

29:32.600 --> 29:34.970
Mel, the knife.
Okay.

29:41.540 --> 29:43.740
(grunts)

29:44.680 --> 29:46.280
Why do I feel like
you've done this before?

29:47.510 --> 29:48.980
(grunting)

29:49.820 --> 29:52.400
This reminds me
of Catholic school.

29:52.600 --> 29:53.740
You could learn
a thing or two

29:53.940 --> 29:55.120
from Sister Mary Catherine...

29:56.520 --> 29:57.470
Yes!

29:57.670 --> 29:58.740
Better!

29:58.940 --> 29:59.980
Much better!

30:00.180 --> 30:01.550
Everything's a big
joke with you.

30:01.750 --> 30:03.150
Were you laughing when you
and your CIA abandoned us?

30:03.350 --> 30:06.350
You got a raw deal,
I will not deny that,

30:06.550 --> 30:07.720
but I had nothing to do with it.

30:07.920 --> 30:09.090
Pulling out

30:09.290 --> 30:10.250
was not my call.

30:10.450 --> 30:12.010
MAN 2:
Fisk.

30:14.140 --> 30:16.910
Sticking to
the same story, I see.

30:19.010 --> 30:20.750
Enrique.

30:21.950 --> 30:24.190
Still not taking responsibility.

30:27.590 --> 30:31.890
I lost a lot of good men
when you Americans pulled out.

30:32.990 --> 30:36.160
Men who were
tortured for sport.

30:37.430 --> 30:39.030
And then killed.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.770
And their families?

30:44.040 --> 30:46.940
Montilla and his men
did far worse to them.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.780
I trusted you.

30:51.980 --> 30:54.280
I took your word.

30:58.620 --> 31:00.390
I'm sorry, Enrique.

31:04.930 --> 31:07.510
If I could've done
something, I would have.

31:07.710 --> 31:09.810
We were comrades in arms.

31:10.010 --> 31:11.980
If it weren't
for that,

31:12.180 --> 31:13.920
you'd already
be dead.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.220
Tell me
everything

31:16.420 --> 31:19.910
I need to know
to make this right.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.060
Drake, it doesn't

31:23.260 --> 31:24.230
have to be
this way.

31:24.430 --> 31:25.360
You wouldn't understand.

31:25.560 --> 31:26.760
You're right,

31:26.960 --> 31:28.470
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

31:28.670 --> 31:30.370
But I do know
what it is

31:30.570 --> 31:31.950
to live paycheck-to-paycheck.

31:33.550 --> 31:35.310
When an unpaid parking
ticket doubles,

31:35.510 --> 31:38.840
gets your car impounded,
so now you can't get to work.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.480
Lose your job,
no job, no rent.

31:41.680 --> 31:42.810
Next thing
you know, you've got

31:43.010 --> 31:44.950
an eviction notice
pinned to the door.

31:45.150 --> 31:48.090
And then things get really
desperate

31:48.290 --> 31:51.490
'cause now you're doing
whatever it takes to survive.

31:51.690 --> 31:52.890
I know that fear,

31:53.090 --> 31:55.180
and it ain't pretty.

31:57.980 --> 32:00.280
I didn't even know
who I was anymore.

32:01.280 --> 32:04.640
I didn't... I didn't think
I had anything left

32:04.840 --> 32:06.290
to contribute to this world.

32:09.190 --> 32:11.740
But thank God I had a net.

32:11.940 --> 32:13.380
My family.

32:13.580 --> 32:14.910
I was able
to move in

32:15.110 --> 32:17.650
with my niece,
to help raise

32:17.850 --> 32:19.200
her wonderful daughter.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.970
That gave me purpose again.

32:27.140 --> 32:31.050
And bought me time, time to
figure out what to do next.

32:33.380 --> 32:35.170
So...

32:35.370 --> 32:36.670
what'd you do?

32:36.870 --> 32:37.800
Believe it
or not,

32:38.000 --> 32:39.500
I started painting again.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.110
Like my life depended on it.

32:41.310 --> 32:42.840
Yeah? How'd that
work out for you?

32:43.040 --> 32:44.040
It worked
out great.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.440
I-I showed at
an art gallery,

32:45.640 --> 32:47.290
and now...

32:49.700 --> 32:51.970
I teach art to kids.

32:53.230 --> 32:56.050
Drake,
I promise you,

32:56.250 --> 32:57.620
if I can do it, you can, too.

32:57.820 --> 33:00.060
I think the world's gonna
look at us a bit differently.

33:00.260 --> 33:01.380
I think you're wrong.

33:02.810 --> 33:04.630
The buildings,
the bridges

33:04.830 --> 33:05.830
that you built
with your hands,

33:06.030 --> 33:07.400
they're
still standing.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.870
You did that.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.200
They make a
difference in our lives

33:11.400 --> 33:12.940
every single day.

33:13.140 --> 33:14.910
You're right about that,
but here I am.

33:15.110 --> 33:16.570
They may
be able to

33:16.770 --> 33:19.510
take away your pension, but they
cannot take away who you are,

33:19.710 --> 33:22.030
and what you've achieved.

33:26.070 --> 33:28.920
You can do this again.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.750
You still have so much

33:30.950 --> 33:32.210
to offer
the world.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.530
(door crashes open)
OFFICER:
He's got a gun.

33:37.730 --> 33:38.760
Take him down!
Take him down!

33:38.960 --> 33:40.230
(grunts)

33:40.430 --> 33:41.470
Drop the weapon!

33:41.670 --> 33:42.430
His gun is empty!

33:42.630 --> 33:43.700
Please, no!

33:43.900 --> 33:45.400
His gun is empty.
It's empty!

33:45.600 --> 33:46.950
It's empty.
Dee.

33:53.360 --> 33:54.010
She's right.

33:54.210 --> 33:57.000
Gun's not loaded.

33:59.070 --> 34:01.000
Delilah, what
are you doing?

34:01.770 --> 34:03.650
Come on.

34:03.850 --> 34:05.140
Don't move.

34:07.110 --> 34:10.590
You have the right
to remain silent.

34:10.790 --> 34:11.730
Anything
you say can

34:11.930 --> 34:12.930
and will be
used against you

34:13.130 --> 34:14.800
in a court
of law.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.100
You have the right
to an attorney...

34:16.300 --> 34:19.500
I meant what I said.

34:19.700 --> 34:21.440
You can do it.

34:21.640 --> 34:23.620
(handcuffs click)

34:24.630 --> 34:25.710
OFFICER:
Let's go, buddy.

34:25.910 --> 34:27.360
Come on.

34:35.400 --> 34:36.900
(grunting)

34:40.310 --> 34:41.790
Your goon can hit me

34:41.990 --> 34:43.760
as much as you want.

34:43.960 --> 34:44.830
I can't tell you

34:45.030 --> 34:46.210
what I don't know!

34:48.220 --> 34:51.950
Then I guess we'll have
to try something else, hmm?

34:53.190 --> 34:55.370
ENRIQUE:
Give me the
information I need.

34:55.570 --> 34:56.770
FISK: You're wasting
your time, Enrique.

34:56.970 --> 34:58.160
(whispering):
That's Fisk.

34:59.130 --> 35:02.110
I was hoping to avoid this,

35:02.310 --> 35:04.380
but you give me no other
choice, yeah?

35:04.580 --> 35:07.950
These side effects
are rather unpleasant,

35:08.150 --> 35:09.420
but...

35:09.620 --> 35:10.790
it seems war

35:10.990 --> 35:14.340
has made us both monsters.

35:16.180 --> 35:17.430
What do they
want with Fisk?
I don't know,

35:17.630 --> 35:19.060
but if they gave
him that drug,

35:19.260 --> 35:21.330
we've got 90 minutes
to get him out of here.

35:21.530 --> 35:25.490
We've got company.
(men shouting)

35:28.990 --> 35:30.610
(gunfire)

35:30.810 --> 35:32.530
Go, go, go!

35:53.580 --> 35:54.400
We're pinned.

35:54.600 --> 35:55.600
There's no way out.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.450
What're we
gonna do?

35:59.290 --> 36:01.440
MAN:
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

36:01.640 --> 36:02.470
(gunfire stops)

36:02.670 --> 36:03.510
MAN:
We need them alive!

36:03.710 --> 36:05.660
(shouting in Spanish)

36:13.700 --> 36:15.170
Mel?

36:17.140 --> 36:18.760
(shouts in Spanish)

36:18.960 --> 36:21.040
Where are they
taking her?

36:24.250 --> 36:27.130
If anything happens to her...

36:27.330 --> 36:28.300
WOMAN:
It's not
your friend

36:28.500 --> 36:30.080
you should be
worried about.

36:35.020 --> 36:36.070
Michelle?

36:36.270 --> 36:37.140
I thought you were dead.

36:37.340 --> 36:38.660
I thought I was, too.

36:39.730 --> 36:41.210
Many times over.

36:41.410 --> 36:44.550
But do you know
what got me through?

36:44.750 --> 36:46.780
Was waiting...

36:46.980 --> 36:48.570
for this moment.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.560
What the hell, Michelle?

37:00.760 --> 37:01.870
You left me for dead.

37:02.070 --> 37:03.430
Because I thought you were dead.

37:03.630 --> 37:05.370
We were overrun.

37:05.570 --> 37:08.040
I saw the IED
level that building.

37:08.240 --> 37:10.140
Bishop had to
pull me out of there...
You were supposed

37:10.340 --> 37:11.960
to be my Bishop.

37:13.460 --> 37:15.260
But do you know who was?

37:16.800 --> 37:18.230
Enrique Vargas.

37:19.300 --> 37:21.350
I need that info.

37:21.550 --> 37:22.750
I can't help you, Enrique,

37:22.950 --> 37:25.220
even if I wanted to,

37:25.420 --> 37:26.790
which I don't.

37:26.990 --> 37:27.990
Give him another
shot of the serum.

37:28.190 --> 37:29.810
He'll break
eventually.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.020
(groaning)

37:40.020 --> 37:44.210
Michelle, you know me
better than anyone.

37:44.410 --> 37:46.680
I would never have left you
if I had a choice.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.650
Did you know that the IEDs

37:48.850 --> 37:51.520
that took out that
building were armed

37:51.720 --> 37:52.680
with an incendiary
component?

37:52.880 --> 37:54.850
Ed and I had no way out.

37:55.050 --> 37:56.550
We took
shelter

37:56.750 --> 37:58.790
in a below-ground
supply room.

37:58.990 --> 38:01.860
When the IED detonated,
the blast was so severe

38:02.060 --> 38:03.880
that it blew out
my ear drums.

38:04.650 --> 38:05.800
And Ed?

38:06.000 --> 38:07.800
We were separated
when the roof caved in

38:08.000 --> 38:09.600
from the blast.

38:09.800 --> 38:10.900
Literally folded between us.

38:11.100 --> 38:13.740
I found a small hole
to the other side.

38:13.940 --> 38:15.210
Ed put his
hand through

38:15.410 --> 38:16.890
and reached out for me.

38:18.020 --> 38:19.840
You know,
I remember thinking,

38:20.040 --> 38:22.550
"Thank God he made it,"

38:22.750 --> 38:25.700
as I held his hand
around my arm.

38:26.500 --> 38:29.020
Only...

38:29.220 --> 38:32.090
it turns out among the supplies
on Ed's side of the room

38:32.290 --> 38:35.340
were a dozen drums of kerosene.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.060
And the blast ignited them.

38:39.260 --> 38:40.230
Yeah.

38:40.430 --> 38:42.070
The collapsed roof
protected me,

38:42.270 --> 38:43.400
but not Ed.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.100
Michelle...

38:45.300 --> 38:48.390
He held on to me
the entire time.

38:50.290 --> 38:53.310
Even as the flame
engulfed his body

38:53.510 --> 38:55.460
he never let me go.

38:56.260 --> 38:58.750
You know, I would've died myself
from smoke inhalation

38:58.950 --> 39:01.590
if Vargas hadn't pulled me out,
nursed me

39:01.790 --> 39:02.820
back to health,

39:03.020 --> 39:04.200
saved my life.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.760
We were
two survivors

39:06.960 --> 39:09.960
with a common hatred of the CIA,

39:10.160 --> 39:12.360
both victims of their betrayal

39:12.560 --> 39:14.470
and broken promises.

39:14.670 --> 39:16.280
He's using you.

39:17.280 --> 39:19.100
Oh, like the Agency
is using you?

39:19.300 --> 39:22.140
I left the Agency
after Venezuela.

39:22.340 --> 39:24.440
(laughs) And yet, here you are,

39:24.640 --> 39:26.580
still at their beck and call.

39:26.780 --> 39:29.330
Michelle, I'm so sorry. Truly.

39:31.030 --> 39:33.330
"Sorry" won't bring Ed back.

39:34.900 --> 39:36.940
(guns cock)
Put them down.

39:37.940 --> 39:38.820
I'll take care of this myself.

39:39.020 --> 39:40.270
I'm not going
to fight you.

39:44.010 --> 39:44.960
I'm not going to fight you.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.900
Why, because violence is wrong?

39:47.100 --> 39:48.330
You're like the CIA now.

39:48.530 --> 39:49.630
You're morally superior

39:49.830 --> 39:51.180
to the rest
of the world.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.810
You don't want to fight me,
that's fine. You can sit there

39:55.010 --> 39:56.910
and watch your team die
like I watched Ed

39:57.110 --> 39:59.240
after you abandoned us.

39:59.440 --> 40:02.050
I don't get it. All of this
to get revenge on me?

40:02.250 --> 40:03.450
You would
think

40:03.650 --> 40:05.100
this is only about you.

40:07.330 --> 40:09.770
But you're just the appetizer.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.150
Do you guys smell something?

40:22.050 --> 40:22.800
Yeah, it smells like...

40:23.000 --> 40:24.030
Accelerant.

40:24.230 --> 40:25.990
We got to get out
of here.
Okay.

40:26.690 --> 40:27.950
(door opens)

40:30.020 --> 40:31.510
Light it up.

40:31.710 --> 40:34.040
HARRY: No, no, no, no.
You don't want to do that.

40:34.240 --> 40:35.510
No.

40:35.710 --> 40:37.410
No, no, hold on!

40:37.610 --> 40:38.780
HARRY:
No!

40:38.980 --> 40:40.480
No!

40:40.680 --> 40:42.470
Wait, wait!
(groans)

40:44.140 --> 40:46.590
Michelle, no. They had
nothing to do with any of this.

40:46.790 --> 40:49.240
Unfortunately for them,
it's the best way to hurt you.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.020
Come on.

41:19.840 --> 41:22.080
(gunshots)

41:27.710 --> 41:32.090
(men shouting)

41:36.190 --> 41:38.440
Freeze!
(excited chatter)

41:38.640 --> 41:40.230
Don't move!

41:42.630 --> 41:45.500
(man shouts in Spanish)

41:47.070 --> 41:49.140
There's no way
around it, McCall.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.570
(coughing)

41:53.870 --> 41:55.590
You're going to watch them burn.

41:55.790 --> 41:57.490
And then I'm going to kill you.

41:57.690 --> 41:59.860
(all yelling)

42:00.060 --> 42:03.270
