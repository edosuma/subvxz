00:07.006 --> 00:09.384
Okay, are you sure the messenger
place is sending Vince?

00:09.467 --> 00:11.845
Oh, yeah, I told them
Holly hasn't seen Vince

00:11.928 --> 00:13.847
since Vince found out
Holly loves him

00:13.930 --> 00:16.433
'and now she's desperate to know
how he feels about her'

00:16.516 --> 00:19.102
so they just have to send Vince.

00:19.185 --> 00:21.354
Lauren made a funny.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.273
Don't you think this seems
a little desperate

00:23.356 --> 00:25.483
sending a fake package
just so I can see Vince?

00:25.567 --> 00:27.610
Do you wanna know how
Vince feels about you?

00:27.694 --> 00:29.446
So when he comes to the door,
we'll know.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.073
- How will you know?
- Oh, by the smell.

00:32.156 --> 00:34.242
I can smell love in the air.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.827
I've only been wrong once
and that was right after

00:35.910 --> 00:39.330
my 16th birthday
when I had a nose accident.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.293
You guys

00:43.376 --> 00:45.587
the most disgusting thing just
happened to me on the subway.

00:45.670 --> 00:48.423
- What?
- A man showed it to me.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.552
Showed you what?
I, I don't get it.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.514
Hey, you think
I am such a prude.

00:56.598 --> 00:59.100
He showed me his doodle.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.769
There, are you happy?

01:00.852 --> 01:02.812
What is this? Speedy Courier?

01:02.896 --> 01:04.230
Lauren, I told you
we can't afford

01:04.313 --> 01:05.565
to messenger packages anymore.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.400
- It's my package.
- Yours?

01:07.484 --> 01:09.068
Yeah, okay?
It's a fake package

01:09.152 --> 01:11.738
and we're sending a fake package
to get Vince to come over, okay?

01:11.821 --> 01:13.281
Go ahead, yell at me.

01:13.364 --> 01:15.658
Tell me I'm stupid,
tell me that Vince is all wrong

01:15.742 --> 01:17.285
for me, tell me
that this is a dumb plan

01:17.368 --> 01:19.162
and tell me that I'm wasting
all my time. You know what?

01:19.245 --> 01:20.830
Cancel everything.
The Vince plan is off.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.791
[knock on door]
Oh, my God, that's Vince.

01:22.874 --> 01:24.000
The Vince plan is back on.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.293
Get the package,
answer the door

01:25.376 --> 01:26.878
and stop yelling at me.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.799
Okay, wait.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.175
Okay, I'm ready now.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.386
Oh, look, Vince.

- Hey. How you been?
- Hey.

01:42.852 --> 01:44.562
- Good. You?
- Good. Anything coming back?

01:44.646 --> 01:46.648
- No. Okay.
- Cool, I'll see you.

No, it's not.

And when you don't have
a boyfriend, it gives you

I get to know myself
pretty well.

Vince was clearly all over you.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.303
Are you on crack?

03:00.138 --> 03:03.016
Maybe this is not
such a bad thing after all.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.643
When I was in college,
I was crazy about a guy

03:05.727 --> 03:07.145
who was a lot like Vince.

03:07.228 --> 03:08.605
I loved him.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.940
So did every girl on campus.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.734
And he loved every girl.

03:12.817 --> 03:15.987
I mean, he loved them.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.656
You know what I'm saying?

03:18.740 --> 03:21.200
He had sex with them?

03:22.535 --> 03:24.412
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

[telephone rings]

03:25.997 --> 03:28.458
Hang on.

03:28.541 --> 03:29.834
Hello?

03:29.918 --> 03:31.794
Yes, it is.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.713
What? Oh, my God.
Is he okay?

03:34.964 --> 03:36.674
Oh, well, thanks for calling.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.636
- What? What?
- That was Vince's dispatcher.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.263
- A cab just hit his bike.
- Oh, my God.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.515
- Is he okay?
- He's pretty banged up.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.184
- We should go.
- It's all my fault.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.144
He was delivering
my stupid fake package.

03:48.227 --> 03:50.355
Oh, honey, I am so sorry

03:50.438 --> 03:53.650
but if, God forbid, anything
should happen to that boy

03:53.733 --> 03:56.319
you tell the cops the fake
package was Tina's idea.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.031
- Lauren.
- I cannot go back to jail.

04:14.253 --> 04:17.130
Oh, my God. I killed him.

04:17.214 --> 04:18.632
I killed Vince.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.680
Oh, no, you didn't kill him.

I killed him, Gary.
Or he's okay.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.857
We're still waiting.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.568
Oh, here comes the nurse.
Hey, how's he doing?

04:37.652 --> 04:39.070
He's fine.
Just a couple of stitches

04:39.153 --> 04:40.488
and he has a concussion.

- And who might you be?
- The nurse.

04:53.418 --> 04:57.213
- Vince wants to see you.
- By Vince, do you mean you?

04:57.296 --> 05:01.759
And by see me, do you mean
you wanna take me to dinner?

That sounds lovely
and by that I mean, eww, no.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.350

see Gary first?

05:09.434 --> 05:10.768
No, don't start
reading things into that.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.437
- It could mean anything.
- Exactly.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.564
For instance, he might need
some help with the pee-pee.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.568
Are you gonna be okay?

05:18.651 --> 05:20.695

something by the end of the day.

05:20.778 --> 05:21.738
Yeah, go ahead.

05:21.821 --> 05:22.739
You know, I better go with her.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.158

05:29.996 --> 05:31.956
You girls are here
for Vince, right?

05:32.040 --> 05:34.751
Yeah, but I'm not dating him.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.086
- Yeah, is he okay?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, he's fine.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.047
But we do need to keep him
in the hospital overnight.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.841
Because of the concussion,
he needs to stay awake.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.384
But it certainly looks
like he has enough

05:43.468 --> 05:44.969

05:46.846 --> 05:48.973
Okay, Val,
you better get going now.

Just the fax, ma'am.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.481
Right, uh, you know,
I've been thinking

05:56.564 --> 05:57.857
I really wanna give you

05:57.940 --> 06:00.568
more responsibility with
the company, so you go fax.

06:00.651 --> 06:01.986
Huh, actually, uh

06:02.070 --> 06:03.446
I broke the fax machine
this afternoon

06:03.529 --> 06:04.864
when I dropped
the fake package on it

06:04.947 --> 06:07.116
so I think I'll stay.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.619
I thought you said sick people
made you want to vomit.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.747
No, I love them.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.791
[gags]

06:18.127 --> 06:20.171
So I walked outside
the club with her, okay?

06:20.254 --> 06:22.381
'Cause it was all loud inside
with the music and everything.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.883
And then they were playing,
like, this song

06:23.966 --> 06:26.427
that was like bang, bang,
bang-bang-bang-bang-bang--

06:26.511 --> 06:28.805
Gary, Gary.

06:28.888 --> 06:32.600
I know you're supposed to keep
me awake, but concussion.

06:32.683 --> 06:34.685
Oh, sorry, dude.

06:34.769 --> 06:38.314
- Look, I, I gotta talk to you.
- Sure, what's up?

06:38.397 --> 06:40.399
I kind of need your help
with something.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.528
Oh, damn. You got to pee?

06:43.611 --> 06:45.696
It's about Holly
and it's kind of..

06:45.780 --> 06:48.157
- You can't say anything, okay?
- No, no, no, dude, listen.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.535
You can't tell me,
I got into too much trouble

06:50.618 --> 06:52.495
from knowing too much stuff
about too many things.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.330
Holly's feelings,
Henry's feelings.

06:54.413 --> 06:56.666
Look, just tell me
what it was like

06:56.749 --> 06:58.876
being hit by a car.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.420
I've always wondered what
it'd be like being hit by a car.

07:03.297 --> 07:05.424
Alright, I picked up the package

07:05.508 --> 07:07.593
I got hit by the cab
and the last thing I saw

07:07.677 --> 07:09.971
before the lights went out
was Holly's face.

07:10.054 --> 07:12.056
No, no, no, no.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.184
That was a Holly story.
That was about Holly.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.769
I definitely think
it means something

07:16.853 --> 07:18.271
because even before
the accident

07:18.354 --> 07:20.356
I started
to have these feelings.

07:20.439 --> 07:22.900
Feelings. Now you got feelings.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.695
- I told you no feelings.
- Take it easy.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.572
I can't do anything
about it anyway

07:27.655 --> 07:29.574
because I told Henry
I wouldn't go there.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.702
Can I?

07:32.785 --> 07:34.787
Okay, look, I'm gonna
say this one last time

07:34.871 --> 07:37.623
and then we're never gonna
talk about it again, okay?

07:37.707 --> 07:39.876
You told Henry
you wouldn't go there.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.503
Maybe you shouldn't
go there, man.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.964
Yeah, look,
I, I know you're right.

07:45.047 --> 07:47.049
Besides, so what
if I saw her face?

07:47.133 --> 07:48.384
It doesn't mean anything.

07:48.467 --> 07:49.760
I also saw my baseball glove

07:49.844 --> 07:52.597
my gross Uncle Ruben
and an unfamiliar cat.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.726
- But then again, man--
- No, no.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.187
Don't you need help peeing
or something? Please.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.732
Maybe I should just let Holly
make her own mistakes.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.234
You know? I mean, I went through
it and I turned out okay.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.611
Let me just tell you something.

08:06.694 --> 08:09.071
I wish I had a sister
as wonderful..

08:15.703 --> 08:17.163
Yeah, actually,
we were about to leave

08:17.246 --> 08:19.040
but then I saw you
talking to that patient

08:19.123 --> 08:21.334
and I became very concerned.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.002
I was more concerned.

08:23.085 --> 08:24.253
Oh, well,
you don't have to worry.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.963
He's just having
a very small procedure.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.924
- Well, what kind of procedure?
- Oh, well.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.426
That guy has a sebaceous cyst
on his back

08:30.509 --> 08:31.802

08:35.681 --> 08:38.768
Yeah, yeah, you see, there's
this sac that fills up with pus

08:38.851 --> 08:40.937
and I have to drain it and..

08:42.647 --> 08:43.856
...pull that sac out.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.447

be okay over there?

08:51.530 --> 08:54.242
I know how the doctor stuff
makes you ill.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.619
The toughest part is the smell.

08:58.663 --> 08:59.914
Oh.

09:03.459 --> 09:06.671

to be keeping me awake.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.927
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.513
- How are you feeling?
- A little better.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.308
I bought you some stuff
from the gift shop.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.143
I got you a toothbrush,
some film

09:21.227 --> 09:24.146
and a little personalized
license plate.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.232
- Mike?
- All the good stuff was gone.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.734
Apparently, there was
a big bus accident.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.153
[clears throat]

09:31.237 --> 09:33.281
Listen, I have something
to tell you.

09:33.364 --> 09:34.532
Okay.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.242
Umm..

09:36.325 --> 09:39.829
The package that you picked up,
it was a fake

09:39.912 --> 09:43.916
and I feel sick about it
because if it weren't from Tina

09:44.000 --> 09:47.378
then you wouldn't be here.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.255
- Tina.
- Yeah, well..

09:49.338 --> 09:51.007
The truth is I hadn't seen you
since the whole thing

09:51.090 --> 09:52.967
with Henry happened
and I just wanted to make sure

09:53.050 --> 09:54.760
that we're still..

09:56.095 --> 09:57.388
...friends.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.725
Friends, yes.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.768
Hell, yeah.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.438
We're, we're great friends.
Yeah.

10:05.521 --> 10:06.897
Okay, good, just, you know

10:06.981 --> 10:10.026
'cause I didn't wanna
lose you as a friend.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.321
No way. Never happen.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.202
Okay, well, good.
I'm gonna get going.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.372
Uh, is there, uh, anything
else that you need?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.583
Well, Gary took my pillow.

10:25.666 --> 10:26.959
Oh, yeah.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.177
Great. That's perfect.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.930
My hand is stuck.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.623
[instrumental music]

11:16.467 --> 11:18.969
Oh, my God, that was..

11:19.053 --> 11:20.721
...bad. That was really bad.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.431
Well, you took me by surprise.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.266
Usually my lips are way looser.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.476
No, no.

11:25.559 --> 11:28.437
That was great.
That was fantastic.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.441
- But Henry.
- Henry?

11:32.525 --> 11:34.568
What about Henry?

11:34.652 --> 11:35.778
After you and Henry broke up

11:35.861 --> 11:39.448
I told him I would
never go there with you.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.617
Yeah, well, you know I could see
how that would be hard.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.953
But I did get whacked
in the head today

11:44.036 --> 11:46.288
so maybe I don't remember
telling him that.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.878
- I gotta talk to him.
- No, I don't know.

11:52.962 --> 11:57.049
No, like, Henry's a friend,
but I got hit by a cab today

11:57.133 --> 11:59.135
and I could have died.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.056
I never would have gotten
to kiss you.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.184
Twice.

12:08.686 --> 12:09.937
[yawns]

12:11.647 --> 12:13.983
Holly, when did you..

12:14.066 --> 12:15.526
D-did I fall asleep?

12:15.609 --> 12:17.653
Oh, I must have been
fast asleep.

12:17.736 --> 12:20.489
I was so asleep,
I had a dream I was sleeping.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.117
I didn't hear nothing.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.663
You're only supposed to have
one visitor at a time.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.957
You stay.
I had a dream about you.

12:33.752 --> 12:34.837
[sighs]

12:34.920 --> 12:36.964
You know, I've just been
reflecting on my life

12:37.047 --> 12:40.050
and I realize
that I have nothing.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.510
You have brains and beauty.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.262
You know, why shouldn't you
have a doctor boyfriend too?

12:43.345 --> 12:45.890
That way, it's even. You have
everything and I have nothing.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.936
Okay.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.564
Yeah, you should get going.
Nobody likes a sad sack.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.650
I want a doctor.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.028
I've wanted one
since I was a little girl.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.529
Lauren, that is so shallow.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.406
Oh, and you don't want a doctor?

13:02.490 --> 13:03.991
I don't care what the man does.

13:04.074 --> 13:07.203
I am attracted to him
for his warm smile

13:07.286 --> 13:08.662
and gentle sense of humor.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.207
Mm-hmm. Which part
did you find more amusing?

13:11.290 --> 13:14.084
The pus sac or the leakage?

13:14.168 --> 13:17.713
All of it. The whole stinking
mess was just hilarious.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.215
Alright, you know what?
That's it.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.758
I am pulling out the big guns.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.677
I'm heading to the ladies' and
I'm gonna pretty myself up.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.764
[gags]

13:29.308 --> 13:30.726
- Oh-oh.
- What, what, what?

13:30.809 --> 13:32.144
Uh, you're not gonna
believe what happened.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.063
- Is Vince okay?
- Yes, he's unbelievable.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.231
We kissed.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.732
Uh, my hand got stuck
under his pillow

13:36.815 --> 13:38.776
we locked eyes,
and then bam, it happened.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.571
- Oh, God, what have you done?
- What?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.573
What do you mean? What do you
mean what have I done?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.825
I kissed Vince
and it was unbelievable.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.577
It was fantastic,
it was perfect

13:48.661 --> 13:50.412
and it was exactly the way
I imagined it

13:50.496 --> 13:52.998
except for the fact that we were
in a hospital and not Paris

13:53.082 --> 13:54.416
but other than that, whoo!

13:56.126 --> 13:57.670
I know you're not
gonna like this

13:57.753 --> 14:01.298
but I'm really worried about
this thing with you and Vince.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.926
Why do you hate happy Holly?

14:04.009 --> 14:06.262
I don't.
I want you to be happy, okay?

14:06.345 --> 14:08.430
- I just, I know--
- You know, stop it.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.099
I think I know him
better than you

14:10.182 --> 14:11.767
and the way that he kissed me
and the way that he looked

14:11.850 --> 14:13.769
at me, I know that he feels
the same way about me

14:13.852 --> 14:15.813
and if you would have been
there, you would have known.

14:15.896 --> 14:18.107
It would have been weird, but
at least you would have known.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.693
Holly..

14:20.776 --> 14:22.027
[laughs]

14:29.535 --> 14:30.786
Let me help you out.

14:30.869 --> 14:32.288
I'm not listening
to what you say anyway.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.622
Thank you.

14:44.842 --> 14:45.884
Henry.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.761
- Hey, man.
- W-what are you--

14:47.845 --> 14:49.179
- I heard about Vince.
- What'd you hear?

14:49.263 --> 14:51.640
'Cause I didn't hear anything.
Nothing.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.475
Where is he?
I wanna talk to him.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.270
Talk to him? Well, after
the whole thing with Holly

14:56.353 --> 14:58.480
I thought you'd wanna
stay away from the guy.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.649
No, man, you know

15:00.733 --> 15:02.693
I've been doing a lot
of thinking about it

15:02.776 --> 15:05.362
and you know,
it wasn't his fault

15:05.446 --> 15:07.823
that Holly had feelings for him.

15:07.906 --> 15:09.742
And when that whole thing
happened, he even told me

15:09.825 --> 15:11.493
that he would stay away
from her.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.995
Yeah, well,
what's so hard about that?

15:13.078 --> 15:16.915
I mean, he doesn't like her.
I've seen no evidence of it.

15:16.999 --> 15:20.169
I'm just saying that,
you know, he's a stand-up guy

15:20.252 --> 15:22.212
and just between you and me

15:22.296 --> 15:25.591
I'm glad that he did
because, uh

15:25.674 --> 15:27.843
I still got feelings for her.

15:27.926 --> 15:30.304
Feelings, more feelings.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.972
- So where is he? In here?
- Uh, yeah.

15:32.056 --> 15:35.100
But you know, uh, he's, he's
only allowed one-one visitor

15:35.184 --> 15:37.394
at a time and I'm in there.

15:41.607 --> 15:44.151
Oh, no. Oh, God.
Did he die?

15:44.234 --> 15:46.779
Oh, please, Lord.

15:49.573 --> 15:50.991
They needed another X-ray.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.201
He'll be back
in a couple of minutes.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.661
Oh, okay, well,
listen, there was a girl

15:53.744 --> 15:54.995
hanging all over him, right?

15:55.079 --> 15:57.039
- Did you see her?
- Cafeteria.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.832
Thank you. You're hot.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.878
Hey, Henry, uh, by any chance

16:02.961 --> 16:04.213
do you have a
"Sports Illustrated" on you?

16:04.296 --> 16:05.422
- Which week?
- Any week.

16:05.506 --> 16:08.050
- No.
- Damn.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.927
You know what? Vince
really wants that real bad

16:10.010 --> 16:11.720
and I got everything but that,
but I gotta go down

16:11.804 --> 16:13.972
to the cafeteria and get him
some chili cheese fries, so--

16:14.056 --> 16:15.140
Oh, yeah, I'm on it.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.017
- Alright.
- Yeah.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.938
[all laughing]

16:21.021 --> 16:22.564
Oh, my God, are you serious?

16:22.648 --> 16:25.984
They were taking the placebo
and they had no idea.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.528
Ha, you sure tricked them.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.113
Oh, man, it was beautiful.

16:29.196 --> 16:30.572
Oh, if you like that,
I gotta tell you

16:30.656 --> 16:31.990
about this time in med school

16:32.074 --> 16:34.368
when I put a cornea
in my roommate's martini.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.036
"What, ah!"

16:36.120 --> 16:38.414
Oh, my God, I was a nut.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.710
Oh, hey, what's that?
Is that a Code Blue?

16:45.003 --> 16:48.173
Hmm, too late for a Code Blue.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.800
I lost this one.

16:49.883 --> 16:52.261
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.388
[laughs]

16:54.471 --> 16:56.682
Oh, that bit never gets old.

17:01.311 --> 17:02.938
I told you Vince loves you.

17:03.021 --> 17:05.482
I am so good at this.
I always know who loves who.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.025
So how'd he kiss?
I know it was good.

17:07.108 --> 17:08.318
I always know who kisses good.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.487
Oh, my God.
It was amazing, it was so--

17:10.570 --> 17:12.698
I saw everything, everything.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.657
I know you kissed Vince.
I know he likes you.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.785
I know he promised Henry
he wouldn't go there

17:16.868 --> 17:18.203
but now he wants to go there

17:18.287 --> 17:19.872
and he's about to tell Henry,
but he can't.

17:19.954 --> 17:21.248
Okay, what are you
talking about?

17:21.330 --> 17:22.790
Henry is not over you.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.917
If he finds out you and Vince
want to hook up, it'll kill him.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.795
You can't do this to the guy.
He's not ready.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.797
Okay, okay, calm down.
Nothing's happened.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.383
- Vince hasn't talked to Henry.
- Henry is here.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.387
- What?
- Look, he came to see Vince.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.930
But Vince had to go
and get an X-ray

17:37.014 --> 17:38.182
so we bought a little time.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.142
What if Vince tells him?

17:40.225 --> 17:42.186
Oh, I didn't think of that.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.812
Why the hell do you think
I've been running around

17:43.896 --> 17:45.564
this hospital like a chicken
with my head cut off?

17:45.647 --> 17:49.485
- Okay, come on. Let's go.
- Y'all go ahead, I'm tired.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.903
Come on.

17:55.282 --> 17:58.285
Hey, remember back when I was
gonna fight you for Dr. Turner?

17:58.368 --> 18:01.413
Well, your friendship
means too much to me.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.415
I love you, Valerie.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.836
- He nauseates me.
- Oh.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.464
I know,
I timed that placebo story.

18:10.547 --> 18:13.467
It was eight minutes
with no payoff.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.469
Well, it was better
than the perforated bowel

18:15.552 --> 18:16.553
on the subway story.

18:16.637 --> 18:17.846
Oh.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.681
You know, why does everybody
wanna date a doctor?

18:19.765 --> 18:21.016
I don't know.
I'm cured of that.

18:21.099 --> 18:22.518
- Me too.
- Yeah.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.770
Hey, uh, Lauren, I get off
in about a half an hour.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.355
I was wondering if you'd like
to join me for dinner.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.774
I would be honored, doctor.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.865
Okay, I am gonna go to the room
and see if Vince is back

18:36.949 --> 18:38.909
and you keep an eye out
for Henry, okay?

18:40.202 --> 18:42.871
- I see him.
- Hey.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.707
- Hi.
- So you saw Vince, huh?

18:45.791 --> 18:48.544
Yeah, we, uh, had a little talk.

18:48.627 --> 18:49.753
You talked?

18:49.837 --> 18:51.255
Well, you know
he has a concussion

18:51.338 --> 18:52.631
and he's been talking crazy.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.091
I mean, I was in there earlier
and he thought

18:54.174 --> 18:56.218
I was Morgan Freeman.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.387
Well, uh, he seemed
pretty clear to me.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.807
Henry, I am so sorry.

19:01.890 --> 19:04.143
- About what?
- Well, I should have told you.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.394
I shouldn't have
let Vince tell you.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.062
At least
I should have been there.

19:07.145 --> 19:09.231
Tell me what?

19:09.314 --> 19:11.066
- What?
- Vince tell me what?

19:11.149 --> 19:13.527
Vince? What are you
talking about? Are you okay?

19:15.237 --> 19:16.405
I've got to go.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.241
Uh, Gary, I'll see you later?

19:19.324 --> 19:21.326
- I'll call you.
- Alright.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.661
Henry.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.331
It was nice seeing you again.

19:34.590 --> 19:35.757
- You off?
- Yep.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.175
- Dinner?
- Nope.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.430
Breakfast, it is.

19:44.474 --> 19:46.977
[knock on door]

19:47.060 --> 19:49.313
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:49.396 --> 19:52.107
I just saw Henry and I know
you didn't say anything to him.

19:52.190 --> 19:53.650
- I couldn't.
- No, I'm glad.

19:53.734 --> 19:54.943
I mean,
I've hurt him enough already.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.194
The last thing I wanna do is--

19:56.278 --> 19:58.572
Me too. I mean,
Henry's a good guy

19:58.655 --> 20:00.657
and he's so not over you.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.328
I can't really blame him.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.000
- But..
- Yeah, but.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.713
Well, maybe after some time.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.592
Yeah, time.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.931
You think it's been enough time?

20:30.020 --> 20:32.814
Hey. What are you
still doing here?

20:32.898 --> 20:35.150
I had a weird feeling
you might need me.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.486
How's Vince?

20:37.569 --> 20:39.196
I think you're gonna
be very happy.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.739
Nothing's gonna
happen with us.

20:40.822 --> 20:43.492
- At least not for a while.
- Why?

20:43.575 --> 20:45.535
Because he's a really,
really good guy

20:45.619 --> 20:48.622
and neither one of us
wants to hurt Henry.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.791
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.293
I guess just keep being friends
and then..

20:53.377 --> 20:56.046
And that is when you break out
the colostomy bag.

20:57.464 --> 20:59.716
Okay, um, what do you do
for your patients

20:59.800 --> 21:02.636
who are, like,
so ready to vomit?

21:02.719 --> 21:04.429
Oh, that reminds me,
I gotta go check on a patient

21:04.513 --> 21:06.682
who's been coughing up massive
amounts of yellow phlegm.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.308
Okay, sweetie.

21:08.392 --> 21:11.353
Can we just save that
for dinner tonight?

21:11.436 --> 21:14.022
- You got it.
- Okay.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.775
Hey, Holly, I got me a doctor.

21:16.858 --> 21:18.110
