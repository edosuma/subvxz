00:09.109 --> 00:10.343
  Hey, Lisa.

00:10.377 --> 00:12.412
The Rigmas are having
a party Friday night.
   You wanna come?

00:12.746 --> 00:14.047
  Me?

00:14.080 --> 00:15.782
 Invited to one of
 your broad shoulders?

00:18.651 --> 00:21.821
  I mean parties.
  I'd love to. I'll be there.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.624
 -Great.
 -We'll see you there.

00:24.657 --> 00:27.460
   -Good taste, Trevor.
   -Thank you, Rick.

00:28.128 --> 00:29.162
 Hey, Morris.

00:30.230 --> 00:31.631
  We've been looking for you.

00:31.664 --> 00:34.300
   Hi, Rick. Hi, Trevor.
   You guys know my friends.

00:35.402 --> 00:37.704
 -No.
 -No.

00:37.737 --> 00:42.676
 Anyway, listen, as you know,
 we only invite the top people
  to join the Rigmas.

00:42.709 --> 00:47.847
 Oh! I'm flattered,
 but I'm just not interested.

00:48.848 --> 00:49.883
   So, Zack.

00:50.817 --> 00:52.852
 What do you say? Wanna pledge?

00:53.486 --> 00:54.854
 Me, a Rigma?

00:54.888 --> 00:57.257
 That'd be great.
 What do I have to do?

00:57.290 --> 01:00.093
   Well, we'll find you after
   school and we'll fill you
   in on the pledge rules.

01:00.126 --> 01:02.062
( chuckles ) All right.

01:02.095 --> 01:05.298
 Zack, you are so lucky,
 they have the wildest parties

01:05.331 --> 01:08.301
-and only
the best-looking girls.
-Really?

01:08.335 --> 01:12.272
  All right!
  I've changed my mind!
  I'll join!

01:12.906 --> 01:14.607
( bell rings )

01:14.641 --> 01:17.744
 <i>* When I wake up</i>
 <i>in the morning and</i>
 <i>the alarm gives out a warning</i>

01:17.777 --> 01:20.714
    <i>* I don't think</i>
    <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

01:20.747 --> 01:23.783
  <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
  <i>and I give myself a look</i>

01:23.817 --> 01:27.420
  <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
  <i>just in time to</i>
  <i>see the bus fly by</i>

01:27.454 --> 01:30.824
   <i>* It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

01:32.892 --> 01:36.262
   <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
   <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

01:36.296 --> 01:38.698
    <i>* And my dog ate</i>
    <i>all my homework last night</i>

01:38.732 --> 01:42.268
  <i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
  <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

01:42.302 --> 01:45.538
 <i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>
 <i>it'll be all right</i>

01:45.572 --> 01:49.609
   <i>* It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

02:03.690 --> 02:07.127
    <i>* It's all right</i>
    <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

02:07.160 --> 02:10.263
    <i>* It's all right</i>
    <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

02:10.295 --> 02:14.267
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

02:20.840 --> 02:24.544
  Carrie: <i>Pledging school clubs</i>
 <i>isn't for everyone.</i>

02:24.577 --> 02:27.580
<i>You have to take orders,</i>
<i>do insane things,</i>

02:27.614 --> 02:30.617
 <i>and endure</i>
 <i>constant humiliation.</i>

02:30.650 --> 02:33.253
 <i>Sort of like being a teacher.</i>

02:33.286 --> 02:35.188
   Trevor:
  <i>Hurry up, Belding's coming.</i>

02:35.221 --> 02:36.623
   Rick: <i>Pledge Zack Morris.</i>

02:36.656 --> 02:38.191
Oh, no.

02:38.224 --> 02:39.259
   Rick: <i>Now.</i>

02:41.361 --> 02:47.267
 ( singing jolly song )

02:48.601 --> 02:50.804
( sighs ) Zack.
Is it really worth it?

02:50.837 --> 02:55.342
 Sure it is.
 Besides all members had to
 go through Rigma pledge week.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.877
It's important.
It's tradition.

02:57.911 --> 03:00.246
  Or in the words of Socrates,

03:00.680 --> 03:02.148
 it's the pits.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.350
 ( bell rings )

03:03.383 --> 03:06.419
Please leave
the quizzes on your desk
and read chapter nine.

03:06.453 --> 03:09.422
   Or sing chapter nine,
   if you'd rather.

03:09.456 --> 03:13.360
   Mikey, collect the papers,
   please, I have a meeting
   with Mr. Belding.

03:13.393 --> 03:14.427
  Thank you.

03:16.763 --> 03:17.797
   Nice hat.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.434
Hey, Screech,
can I carry your books?

03:21.468 --> 03:23.436
 Why?

03:23.470 --> 03:26.673
  Well, every day he has to do
  a favor for someone's
  who's not the coolest.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.609
 Do you mean a borderline nerd?

03:29.642 --> 03:31.311
   No, not that bad.

03:31.344 --> 03:32.746
 Oh, you mean a dweeb.

03:32.779 --> 03:35.215
 Well, that's great.
 Sure, you can carry my books.

03:35.248 --> 03:37.350
 Hold on, hold on.
 You don't understand, Screech.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.553
This is your
chance to get Zack
to do anything for you.

03:40.587 --> 03:42.622
-Anything.
-Mikey.

03:42.655 --> 03:45.625
  ( chuckles evilly ) I see.

03:45.658 --> 03:48.261
Now, Screech,
let's not take advantage
of the situation.

03:48.294 --> 03:49.696
Now, let's see.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.667
  I have a snake named Phil.

03:56.836 --> 03:58.805
 All right...

03:58.838 --> 04:00.407
 All right,
 I'll take care of it.

04:02.375 --> 04:05.345
  ( sighing ) Yes, Mr. Belding,
  you wanted to see me?

04:05.378 --> 04:06.513
   Here, read this.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.218
  All principals
  are to designate
  an acting principal

04:12.252 --> 04:15.622
 to act as principal when
 the actual principal cannot be
 there to act as principal.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.625
 Have you broken this code yet?

04:19.659 --> 04:22.362
  Look,
  the school board now requires
  a substitute principal

04:22.395 --> 04:23.797
  whenever I'm not on campus.

04:23.830 --> 04:26.566
  There's a one-week trial run.
  Will you do it?

04:26.599 --> 04:29.536
 Mr. Belding,
 it would be an honor.

04:29.569 --> 04:31.538
Oh, by the way,

04:31.571 --> 04:32.605
 what's in it for me?

04:33.707 --> 04:36.242
 All right. New encyclopedias.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.312
  But it's gotta
  be the full set,
  that's A through Z.

04:39.346 --> 04:42.816
   Okay, but the Q book's
   propping up the short leg
   on my dining room table,

04:42.849 --> 04:45.085
 and now the soup
 is going to slide
 into Grandma Belding.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.294
 Hi, guys, have you seen them?

04:54.327 --> 04:55.795
  There they are! ( giggles )

04:55.829 --> 04:57.564
  That is not funny.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.432
  You have no idea what they're
  putting me through.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.434
 Whatever it is, it's worth it.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.436
   Be all you can be, Zack.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.504
  Be a Rigma.

05:06.606 --> 05:10.310
Shh, don't say anything.
I just can't do
more of this stuff.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.613
   Has anybody here
   seen Zack Morris?

05:13.646 --> 05:14.681
  Here he is.

05:15.815 --> 05:16.683
 There you are!

05:16.716 --> 05:18.585
 I've been looking
 all over for you guys.

05:18.618 --> 05:19.719
  Mr. Morris.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.521
 We would like to
 see you up on stage.

05:21.554 --> 05:23.289
   Would you like to
   see him up on stage,
   Trevor?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.592
 Rick,
 I would like that very much.

05:27.794 --> 05:31.464
  Would anybody like to see Mr.
  Morris do...

05:31.498 --> 05:32.532
  Ten jumping jacks?

05:34.734 --> 05:35.735
 How about 20?

05:35.769 --> 05:37.771
 -Twenty. Do I hear 30?
 -Thirty!

05:39.072 --> 05:40.340
  Could have said 40.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.309
Okay, it's 40.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.645
 I can't believe they're making
 you do this.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.647
   Why don't you just quit?

05:47.681 --> 05:49.416
  Red jackets.

05:50.483 --> 05:51.518
Parties.

05:52.552 --> 05:53.586
   And girls.

05:55.121 --> 05:56.790
   Don't you think
   enough is enough?

05:56.823 --> 05:58.892
   This isn't funny anymore.

05:58.925 --> 06:01.661
 Oh, come on.
 We're just having a good time.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.797
He doesn't have to do this,
if he doesn't want to.

06:03.830 --> 06:05.031
   Ah, thanks, guys.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.567
Of course, Trevor,
he won't become a Rigma.

06:08.568 --> 06:09.602
 ( chuckles awkwardly )

06:14.574 --> 06:16.309
   Morning.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.311
Miss Bliss is acting
as principal this week,

06:18.345 --> 06:20.447
 so I'll be taking over
 all of her classes.

06:22.449 --> 06:26.086
  Uh,
  Miss Bliss usually teaches us
  from inside the classroom.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.388
Inside, right.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.960
 Why don't we just have
 a regular substitute?

06:34.060 --> 06:37.731
 Well, the flu is going around,
 and there is a shortage in
 the substitute pool.

06:37.764 --> 06:41.101
  And why am I
  telling you all this?
  Everyone, sit down.

06:43.803 --> 06:45.538
 Now, what chapter are we on?

06:45.572 --> 06:47.540
 Mr. Belding, this is homeroom.

06:49.376 --> 06:50.910
 Oh... Well...

06:50.944 --> 06:52.078
  What do you do in homeroom?

06:52.078 --> 06:53.480
   Nothing.

06:53.513 --> 06:55.515
   Well, that's gonna
   change right now.

06:55.548 --> 06:58.651
 We are going to do something
 in homeroom. Does anyone have
   any suggestions?

06:58.685 --> 07:00.086
 Hey, we can go home!

07:00.120 --> 07:02.589
 -Children: Yeah!
 -No, no, no.

07:02.622 --> 07:05.325
Come on, now,
let's make this meaningful.
Let's...

07:05.358 --> 07:08.495
  Let's close this
  generation gap.
  Let's rap.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.567
All right, I'll start.
( chuckles nervously )

07:14.601 --> 07:17.904
 Last night Mrs. Belding and I
 were celebrating our
 wedding anniversary.

07:17.937 --> 07:21.041
 It was her eighth, my seventh.
 ( laughs )

07:21.041 --> 07:23.610
 She encourages me
 to be zany like that.

07:23.643 --> 07:25.712
 How romantic.

07:25.745 --> 07:28.481
So, where did you meet
the old ball and chain?

07:29.649 --> 07:32.385
 We were in high school,
 at a Halloween party.

07:32.419 --> 07:35.155
   We were bobbing for apples,
   and our retainers locked.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.157
After that we were
stuck with each other.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.664
  Surf's up.

07:44.698 --> 07:48.735
 This is so dumb. I don't know
 how I ever thought those
 guys were so cool.

07:48.768 --> 07:50.637
 So, you're not
 going to their party?

07:50.670 --> 07:54.774
Oh, I'm still going.
But I won't dance well.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.676
   Mr. Belding,
   what are you doing here?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.912
   Actually, we were
   just shooting the breeze.

07:58.945 --> 08:00.080
   By the way, Zack,

08:00.113 --> 08:01.114
  cowabunga.

08:03.516 --> 08:06.720
  Well, that was
  really a great homeroom.
  Thanks for coming.

08:06.753 --> 08:09.456
 Take care. See you real soon.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.557
   What am I doing?

08:11.925 --> 08:13.693
Zack, you have company.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.829
Hey, beach bum.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.798
 I've had about enough of this.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.800
 Why don't you guys
 just leave him alone?

08:20.834 --> 08:22.635
  -Get lost.
  -You're on your own, Zack.

08:24.871 --> 08:29.042
   Mr. Morris,
   Rick and I have a little
   surprise for you.

08:29.042 --> 08:32.178
( whispering ) I can't
watch this. Tell me
everything that happens.

08:33.645 --> 08:35.515
 Excuse me, children.

08:35.548 --> 08:37.583
   Children, would you mind
   leaving us alone?

08:37.616 --> 08:39.552
   Should we leave
   'em alone, Lisa?

08:39.586 --> 08:41.688
  -I don't know.
  What do you think, Nikki?
  -( sighs )

08:41.721 --> 08:43.789
 I think we sound
 like two jerks, Lisa.

08:47.594 --> 08:48.628
   Hi, Zack.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.098
 Uh...

08:52.132 --> 08:55.802
 I... I know this is
 none of my business,

08:55.835 --> 08:58.905
but don't you think
the Rigmas are pushing
this a little too far?

09:02.108 --> 09:04.177
  Maybe you're right.

09:04.210 --> 09:08.014
  I remember when I was
  at college they made me eat
  live goldfish. ( chuckles )

09:08.581 --> 09:10.016
Please.

09:10.016 --> 09:12.085
 So, Mr.
 Morris, how about some sushi?

09:12.118 --> 09:14.854
Aw, come on, fellas,
anything but raw fish.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.790
  We're just kidding, Morris.

09:16.823 --> 09:19.592
  You look a little cold there.
  Maybe this'll warm you up.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.663
 I'm in! I did it! All right!

09:23.697 --> 09:24.864
  Not so fast, pledge breath.

09:25.765 --> 09:27.567
-We're your friends.
-Sure you are.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.502
 Then what do you
 call the people
 that were just here.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.104
   Friends.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.640
   Correction.
   Rigmas only hang
   out with Rigmas.

09:33.673 --> 09:35.041
  As of this moment,

09:35.041 --> 09:36.443
   they're history.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.144
But they've
always been my friends.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.714
  If you wanna wear the jacket,
  you gotta pay the price.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.082
  Kiss them goodbye.

09:53.059 --> 09:56.629
  Tracey, tell Mrs.
  Barnes that I'm approving
  her field trip

09:56.663 --> 09:58.765
 under one condition.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.968
 This year she remembers
 to take her students with her.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.037
  I gotta hand it
  to you, Miss Bliss.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.473
 You run a happy ship.

10:06.506 --> 10:09.142
I'm sure Mr.
Belding would have done
the same thing.

10:09.175 --> 10:12.712
   Well, it's because of
   you I got to watch them
   tow away that blue Yugo.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.148
Felt good.
Thank you, Miss Bliss.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.784
Anything to keep
our ship happy.

10:17.817 --> 10:20.387
 I don't wanna seem ungrateful,
 Miss Bliss,
 but you know,

10:20.420 --> 10:22.522
   we could really use
   an electric leaf blower.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.057
 My men have been
 stooping over so much

10:24.090 --> 10:27.560
  they're all starting
  to look up to Shorty Beman.

10:27.594 --> 10:31.765
 I'm sure we can
 arrange something, Mylo.
 We'll talk about this later.

10:31.798 --> 10:32.832
Thank you, Miss Bliss.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.705
  Did he just thank
  you for something?

10:38.738 --> 10:41.574
   Yes. I helped him out,
   he was grateful.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.109
 Never thanks me for anything.

10:43.743 --> 10:45.045
Well...

10:45.078 --> 10:46.980
   When was the last
   time you helped him out?

10:47.013 --> 10:48.848
I don't see what
that has to do with it.

10:48.882 --> 10:49.916
  ( telephone rings )

10:50.750 --> 10:52.619
Acting Principal Bliss.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.456
Oh, hello, Mrs. Murphy.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.726
   -( mouthing ) Blah,
   blah, blah, blah.
   -Mmm-hmm.

10:59.759 --> 11:02.762
 Yes, I did receive
 the flowers and the cookies.

11:02.796 --> 11:03.830
  Thank you.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.699
Great.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.802
   I really have to go now.

11:08.835 --> 11:09.869
   Goodbye.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.073
 Mrs. Murphy sent you flowers?

11:13.073 --> 11:15.075
 And cookies.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.510
  All I ever get from her
  are complaints that the kids
  are littering her lawn.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.080
 Not anymore.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.583
  I got the crossing guard to
  move over one corner in
  front of her house.

11:23.616 --> 11:26.519
   He keeps an eye on the kids,
   and they don't litter.

11:26.553 --> 11:29.823
 I thought of that,
 I just hadn't gotten
 around to it yet, that's all.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.758
  Oh.

11:31.791 --> 11:33.626
 How are you getting
 on with the students?

11:33.660 --> 11:36.463
   Oh, fine. I'm teaching,
   they're learning.

11:36.496 --> 11:40.467
   I feel as though,
   in a small way, I'm making
   an impact on their lives.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.770
   Mr. Belding,
   you've only had homeroom.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.706
 Picky, picky, picky.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.213
 Okay,
 Morris, it's time for you
 to test your loyalty.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.118
 -Now?
 -Now.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.192
  Hey, guys.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.128
I hope you understand
that I don't want to do
what I'm about to do,

12:08.161 --> 12:10.063
  but I have to do it.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.097
  What are you talking about?

12:15.602 --> 12:18.805
So, Mikey, still in love
with Caitlin over here?

12:18.838 --> 12:20.140
 Zack!

12:20.173 --> 12:24.644
Hey, Caitlin, this
guy's got the hots for you.
Go on, ask her out.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.116
( door slams )

12:30.150 --> 12:31.184
What's wrong with him?

12:31.217 --> 12:34.587
That was one of
the meanest things
I've ever seen.

12:34.621 --> 12:35.722
Come on,
you have to understand.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.625
 Once I get into the club,
 everything will be different.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.127
   ( both chanting ) Rigma!
   Rigma! Rigma!

12:42.729 --> 12:44.664
 Remember, different.

12:44.698 --> 12:47.267
  So, Lisa, why haven't
  you told you parents
  you wear makeup at school?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.235
 You wouldn't.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.671
   555-3190.

12:52.238 --> 12:53.273
How could you?

12:56.676 --> 12:58.178
Zack, what's with you?

12:59.579 --> 13:00.513
( indistinct )

13:00.547 --> 13:01.648
Nikki,

13:02.215 --> 13:03.616
  please forgive me.

13:03.650 --> 13:04.684
   For what?

13:05.518 --> 13:06.553
   For this.

13:08.154 --> 13:09.622
   ( screeching ) You jerk!

13:09.656 --> 13:12.492
 You stupid, disgusting jerk!

13:12.525 --> 13:14.160
   All right, listen,
   I'm allergic to meringue.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.762
  Could you just
  hit me with a plate?

13:15.795 --> 13:16.830
 Just get out of here.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.565
I thought were friends.

13:18.932 --> 13:19.966
We are.

13:22.736 --> 13:25.572
   Look, why would I be friends
   with a nothing like you?

13:28.108 --> 13:30.844
Hey, Screech.
Screech, wait a second.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.812
 You are now a Rigma.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.614
 You're in, buddy.
 ( chuckling )

13:34.647 --> 13:37.917
   Rigmas. Together forever.

13:37.951 --> 13:38.985
   Forever?

13:46.259 --> 13:47.293
   Hi, guys.

13:49.195 --> 13:52.565
  Come on, I just had
  to do all that stuff
  to get in the club.

13:52.599 --> 13:53.767
Did you hear something?

13:53.800 --> 13:55.135
   I thought I did.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.937
  Did it sound like a knife
  going into someone's back?

13:57.971 --> 13:59.606
   Give me a break.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.641
   Hey, Screech, you wanna grab
   a burger after school?

14:01.675 --> 14:04.744
  I'd love to Zack,
  but nothings
  don't eat burgers.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.748
( clears throat )
I'm ready to teach now.

14:11.251 --> 14:14.721
 Good morning, class.
 As you know, my name is Mr...

14:14.754 --> 14:16.222
   Belding.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.091
 Today's lesson is...

14:19.059 --> 14:22.696
 Historical word association.

14:22.729 --> 14:25.198
 Now, what do these
 names have in common?

14:25.231 --> 14:27.834
 James Monroe and Warren G.
 Harding.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.170
  They were United
  States presidents.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.172
   Very good, Lisa.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.107
   Neil Armstrong
   and Buzz Aldrin.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.176
They were the first
astronauts on the moon.

14:36.209 --> 14:40.113
  Buzz Aldrin's real name was
  Edwin, and Neil Armstrong's
  real name was Neil.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.181
  Thank you, Samuel.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.850
  Judas and Benedict Arnold.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.719
   Relatives of Zack Morris?

14:45.752 --> 14:47.253
 -They're both traitors.
 -Belding: All right.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.823
  -That's not funny, Nikki.
  -All right!

14:49.856 --> 14:51.758
It might not be funny,
but it's true.

14:51.791 --> 14:54.194
All right, all right.
That is enough!

14:54.227 --> 14:56.930
Now, our next one is...

14:56.963 --> 14:58.998
  ( stutters )
  Keep them in order!

14:59.099 --> 15:02.936
Come on,
look, now that I'm in,
we can all be friends.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.938
On weekends and stuff.

15:05.038 --> 15:08.341
  Could we really?
  Gee, that's so nice of you.

15:08.375 --> 15:12.112
   Wow! Maybe he'd even
   let us touch his jacket.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.313
  Hey, give me that.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.381
   -Oh, sure. Here!
   -Belding: Class!

15:14.414 --> 15:16.783
 -( all clamoring )
 -Let's not throw the jacket...

15:16.816 --> 15:18.852
 Don't... What did I...
 Did I tell you not...

15:18.885 --> 15:21.688
 All right,
 all right, that's it!

15:21.721 --> 15:22.922
  To the principal's office.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.324
( scoffs ) Who?

15:24.357 --> 15:25.859
  Everybody.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.794
   Sure glad I don't
   have to handle this one.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.263
   Let's go.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.098
 -Single file.
 -Okay, okay.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.837
   ( all clamoring )

15:41.141 --> 15:43.276
 -( whistles )
 -( clamoring stops )

15:43.309 --> 15:44.344
 Okay.

15:45.211 --> 15:47.247
 Now, let me get this straight.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.215
 Mikey got hit in
 the face with a pie.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.384
 No, Nikki got hit in
 the face with a pie.

15:51.418 --> 15:54.087
And Zack only
ruined my entire life.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.257
 And then he called
 someone's parents
 and said Screech wears makeup?

15:57.524 --> 15:58.858
He did?

15:58.892 --> 16:00.427
No, it was my parents.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.163
  And I got home just in time
  to erase the message.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.031
Look, we're only in here
because these guys

16:05.031 --> 16:07.067
 had to throw my jacket
 all over the room.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.535
 -(clamoring resumes )
 -Mr. Belding,
 do you have anything to add?

16:08.568 --> 16:11.371
  Yes, I worked on
  those cards for six hours.

16:13.907 --> 16:16.910
 Zack,
 is what they're saying true?

16:16.943 --> 16:20.180
No. It wasn't a whole pie,
it was a piece of pie.

16:20.213 --> 16:23.249
  It was a pie, Zack,
  no matter how you slice it.

16:23.283 --> 16:27.053
  Mr. Belding, could you please
  take
  the students back to class?

16:27.053 --> 16:29.122
-Zack, stick around.
-I understand.

16:29.155 --> 16:32.192
 If you want to call
 his mother, she's number four
 on my speed dial.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.060
Okay, people. Move out.

16:36.629 --> 16:37.864
  Miss Bliss,

16:38.365 --> 16:39.599
 just be fair.

16:39.632 --> 16:40.867
  Expel him.

16:42.502 --> 16:46.072
   And I never wore
   makeup in my whole life.

16:46.072 --> 16:47.440
Does chap stick count?

16:51.378 --> 16:53.346
 Well?

16:53.380 --> 16:55.081
   They're just jealous because
   I'm in the club
   and they're not.

16:55.115 --> 16:59.319
Hmm. Jealousy
wasn't the emotion that
came to mind, it was...

16:59.352 --> 17:01.254
   It was more, let me see,

17:01.287 --> 17:02.522
 like murder.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.824
 You don't understand either.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.894
  Look,
  if you wanna wear the jacket,
  you've gotta pay the price.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.462
I see.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.397
Well...

17:11.431 --> 17:13.465
  Then you better
  take care of this.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.036
It was very expensive.

17:17.103 --> 17:18.371
Cost you four friends.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.882
   So, how's your day gone?

17:28.915 --> 17:31.217
   Oh, I'd say it's gone
   very, very badly.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.219
 Oh, come on.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.088
 It can't be that bad.

17:35.121 --> 17:36.222
   Let me ask you something.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.124
  Do you really give
  open-book quizzes?

17:38.391 --> 17:39.426
Never.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.528
  I knew it.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.296
 Well,
 don't be so hard on yourself.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.198
  Oh, sure,
  that's easy for you to say,

17:45.231 --> 17:47.967
  you're the perfect teacher
  and the perfect principal.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.938
  "Thank you, Miss Bliss."
  "Thank you, Miss Bliss."
 It drives me crazy.

17:51.971 --> 17:54.407
Calm down, Mr. Belding.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.442
 You're right.

17:55.475 --> 17:58.445
 Maybe I could learn from this.
 How do you do it?

17:58.478 --> 18:01.014
  Well,
  there's really nothing to it.
  I mean...

18:01.014 --> 18:04.217
 Tina needed supplies,
 so I took care of it,

18:04.250 --> 18:07.053
and Mr.
Federman wanted Friday off,
so I arranged it.

18:07.087 --> 18:10.357
   Well, I must say
   I'm impressed. When I call
   they always say no.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.059
 Who says no?

18:13.093 --> 18:14.427
People at
the Board of Education.

18:17.030 --> 18:19.366
 Where you call for approval.

18:19.399 --> 18:23.069
  ( laughs ) You did
  call for approval?

18:23.103 --> 18:26.306
  Uh, I didn't know
  I was supposed to.

18:26.339 --> 18:30.043
 Surely you don't
 need approval to have
 a car towed, do you?

18:30.043 --> 18:33.046
Oh, you mean that broken
down Yugo that's been
there for two weeks?

18:33.046 --> 18:36.082
Right. Why didn't
you ever have it towed?

18:36.116 --> 18:38.084
  Because it's mine.

18:41.054 --> 18:44.090
 Miss Bliss,
 there's a Mrs.
 Murphy on the phone.

18:44.124 --> 18:47.560
 Something about a crossing
 guard's uniform clashing with
 the color of her house.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.129
 Strange lady.

18:49.162 --> 18:52.165
 ( sighs) I'll be right there.

18:52.198 --> 18:55.468
 ( chuckles ) This whole day is
 really messed up, isn't it?

18:55.502 --> 18:56.603
  Thank you.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.706
 -Thank you?
 -You're not perfect.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.074
  She's not perfect.

19:01.107 --> 19:04.010
  There's hope.
  She's not perfect.

19:10.183 --> 19:11.384
   Uh, guys.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.687
 Look, I feel really
 bad about what I did.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.022
   Since I have to choose
   between you and the club,

19:16.056 --> 19:19.259
well, I wanna be with you.
So, your Zack is back.

19:19.292 --> 19:22.562
   Well, I guess I can
   speak for all of us
if I say

19:22.595 --> 19:23.630
   get lost.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.432
 But I chose you over the club.

19:25.465 --> 19:28.368
   And we're choosing
   nothing over you.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.436
Thanks!

19:31.738 --> 19:33.173
 Hey, Morris.

19:33.206 --> 19:34.507
   Come sit with us.

19:34.541 --> 19:35.575
 Yeah.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.310
I'd like that.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.318
   -Thanks.
   -Mmm-hmm.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.320
   You would have done anything
   to become a Rigma,
   wouldn't you?

19:47.354 --> 19:49.456
 You know it,
 and I'd do it again.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.658
  Well, we felt the same way.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.094
  Really,
  what did they make you do?

19:54.127 --> 19:55.595
   They made us find
   an eighth-grader

19:55.628 --> 19:57.630
  and make him believe
  he was pledging the Rigmas.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.366
  Wow, that's great.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.067
 How did the poor sap take it?

20:01.101 --> 20:02.135
( snickering )

20:03.203 --> 20:04.237
 You tell us.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.609
  -Me?
  -Afraid so.

20:09.642 --> 20:13.013
You mean I wasn't pledging?
None of this
stuff I did counted?

20:13.046 --> 20:15.048
 Aw, look on the bright side.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.117
  We got in.

20:17.150 --> 20:19.352
   Rigmas. Together forever.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.420
Trevor.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.431
   Now you know how
   you made us feel.

20:32.298 --> 20:33.466
 So you heard.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.835
Who'd have guessed
they were setting
you up to be a sucker?

20:35.869 --> 20:38.271
 How could they do this to me?

20:38.304 --> 20:42.475
   Well, they wanted to join
   the club so bad that they
   didn't care who they hurt.

20:42.509 --> 20:43.843
Sound familiar?

20:43.877 --> 20:46.680
 You know,
 it really seems like
 a lot of dumb stuff.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.448
  Just to get
  into a few parties.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.316
 Well, it was more than that.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.786
  I thought this was
  my chance to really
  be someone in this school.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.287
 But you already are.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.722
Yeah, to you guys I am.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.090
But that doesn't count.

20:57.123 --> 21:00.593
 What counts is
 what the other guys
 think of me. What counts is...

21:02.195 --> 21:04.764
  That I'm really
  saying dumb things.

21:04.798 --> 21:06.566
 You guys are right
 not to take me back.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.169
  What do you think?

21:09.202 --> 21:11.404
   Should we invite
   him along, Nikki?

21:11.438 --> 21:13.306
   I think that'd be
   very nice, Lisa.

21:13.340 --> 21:14.674
   What do you think, Mikey?

21:14.708 --> 21:16.409
   I think that's
   a very good idea.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.478
   Don't you agree, Screech?

21:19.212 --> 21:20.246
  About what?

21:21.715 --> 21:23.516
   Okay, you coming?

21:24.250 --> 21:25.285
 Yeah.

21:39.366 --> 21:42.402
 ( instrumental music plays )
