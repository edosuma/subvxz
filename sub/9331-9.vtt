00:00.421 --> 00:03.624
♪♪

00:06.337 --> 00:08.179
(sing-songy)
Good morning.

00:08.179 --> 00:10.221
No, great morning.

00:10.221 --> 00:11.592
Ooh!

00:11.592 --> 00:14.055
Look at you all cheery!

00:14.055 --> 00:15.726
Did you have whiskey
in your coffee too?

00:15.726 --> 00:18.269
Uh, so do you remember
when Josh told me that

00:18.269 --> 00:20.561
I should start dating again
and I was really sad?

00:20.561 --> 00:22.813
Well, I'm not anymore.
You wanna know why?

00:22.813 --> 00:24.445
One moment.

00:26.107 --> 00:28.109
Ah. Okay, lay it on me.

00:28.109 --> 00:30.571
Because I'm back
on the market, Yolanda.

00:30.571 --> 00:32.243
I signed up
for this new dating app

00:32.243 --> 00:34.325
called "What's Cookin'?"
for single foodies like me,

00:34.325 --> 00:36.617
and 48 guys already
sent me a hot pepper.

00:36.617 --> 00:38.159
Ooh!

00:38.159 --> 00:39.790
Show me the biggest one.

00:41.712 --> 00:44.295
No. Yolanda, a hot pepper
is like a wink,

00:44.295 --> 00:45.376
and I got tons of 'em.

00:45.376 --> 00:46.587
Oh, I get it.

00:46.587 --> 00:50.511
That's how you know they wanna
get jalapeño business.

00:52.593 --> 00:55.055
Exactly, and that's when
I realized enough about Josh.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.308
There are a million
Joshes in the sea!

00:57.308 --> 00:58.349
See?

00:58.349 --> 01:00.391
Ooh, he's cute.

01:00.391 --> 01:01.812
His name's Conrad.

01:01.812 --> 01:04.024
He's six-one, he has
a successful clothing business,

01:04.024 --> 01:06.687
and he's taking me to
a new tapas bar tonight.

01:06.687 --> 01:09.320
(gasps)
A topless bar
on the first date?!

01:11.152 --> 01:13.244
No. Tapas.

01:13.244 --> 01:15.406
Conrad is looking
for commitment,

01:15.406 --> 01:17.368
unlike other people
who live in this penthouse.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.539
(knocking, door opening)

01:18.539 --> 01:21.752
Ladies, by midnight tonight,

01:21.752 --> 01:23.624
we are all gonna be filthy rich!

01:25.256 --> 01:27.128
Uh-oh. What'd you do?

01:27.128 --> 01:29.089
Everyone at Soul Spin
was talking about

01:29.089 --> 01:31.212
the Mega Ball Jackpot,
and the drawing's tonight,

01:31.212 --> 01:33.134
so I thought should all
go in on a ticket.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.055
Oh, I'm sorry,
but according

01:35.055 --> 01:38.219
to my gamblers anonymous rules,
I'm not allowed to participate.

01:39.930 --> 01:41.932
Well, it's up to $500 million.

01:41.932 --> 01:43.314
Well, good thing it's anonymous!

01:45.186 --> 01:46.357
Are you doing the Mega Ball?

01:46.357 --> 01:48.229
I'm in.

01:48.229 --> 01:49.860
I'll take number three.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.443
That's how many months
before Alan and I go broke.

01:54.285 --> 01:56.447
They raised the rent
on the karaoke bar

01:56.447 --> 01:58.078
and he lost the lease.

01:58.078 --> 01:59.410
Oh, my God!
What is he gonna do?

01:59.410 --> 02:00.871
That's what I asked.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.373
Does he have any other skills?

02:02.373 --> 02:03.454
Thats' what I asked.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.007
Poor Alan. Is he okay?

02:08.299 --> 02:10.171
That's what I didn't ask.

02:11.252 --> 02:13.174
No wonder he's mad at me!

02:14.425 --> 02:16.136
Oh, my God,
I am so loving today.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.258
I am so over Josh,

02:17.258 --> 02:18.259
I have a really hot
date tonight,

02:18.259 --> 02:20.140
and we're gonna win the lottery.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.643
It's blue skies and sunshine
from here on out.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.064
(thunder crashing)

02:25.476 --> 02:27.147
Oh. You hear that, people?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.230
That's the winds
of change a'blowin'.

02:30.731 --> 02:32.152

02:38.279 --> 02:40.281

What are you doing?

02:55.556 --> 02:57.598
I am de-Kaminski-ing
our apartment.

02:57.598 --> 03:00.301
Anything Josh has given me,
I am throwing away.

03:00.301 --> 03:02.303
Oh, like this electric fork

03:02.303 --> 03:04.305
that automatically
twirls your spaghetti up.

03:04.305 --> 03:05.356
(whirring)

03:05.356 --> 03:07.308
I love that fork.

03:07.308 --> 03:09.230
-Well, get over it! It's gone!
-(clank)

03:09.230 --> 03:10.861
So do I look cute
for my date?

03:10.861 --> 03:12.813
Like hot pepper cute?

03:12.813 --> 03:15.075
You look amazing, but, uh...

03:15.075 --> 03:17.488
didn't Josh buy you that jacket?

03:17.488 --> 03:19.119
Oh, good catch!

03:19.119 --> 03:21.582
And, uh, what about
the car he bought you?

03:21.582 --> 03:23.203
Let's not go crazy.

03:24.785 --> 03:26.166
Hey, what's all that for?

03:26.166 --> 03:28.749
Well, Elliot and Yolanda
are coming over tonight

03:28.749 --> 03:31.332
to watch the Mega Ball Lottery
numbers being drawn,

03:31.332 --> 03:33.504
and I just bought
our winning ticket.

03:33.504 --> 03:34.595
Oh, that's right!

03:34.595 --> 03:36.427
Hey, what time are
we becoming millionaires?

03:36.427 --> 03:38.599
I, uh, might invite Conrad
back with me to watch.

03:38.599 --> 03:40.841
Uh, no, no. What if you win?

03:40.841 --> 03:43.183
Then you'll never know
if he likes you for you
of your money.

03:43.183 --> 03:45.346
-(knocking)
-Oh, my God, it's him.

03:45.346 --> 03:46.557
All right, have fun.

03:46.557 --> 03:48.058
I'm gonna go
put on a sports bra

03:48.058 --> 03:49.770
so when we win
and I jump up and down,

03:49.770 --> 03:51.732
my boobs don't go flyin'!

03:54.485 --> 03:56.947
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Conrad.

03:56.947 --> 03:59.410
And wow, do you look
better than your picture.

03:59.410 --> 04:01.322
Oh, thank you.
I'm really excited

04:01.322 --> 04:03.163
to go to that tapas bar
you were talking about.

04:03.163 --> 04:05.326
Oh, it just started to rain.

04:05.326 --> 04:06.577
You better put on a jacket.

04:06.577 --> 04:07.748
Oh. Okay. Thanks.

04:09.540 --> 04:10.331
Trust me...

04:10.331 --> 04:12.543
it's the only time
I'll be asking you

04:12.543 --> 04:14.295
to put on clothes.

04:23.384 --> 04:25.055
So, Josh, in our
last appointment,

04:25.055 --> 04:27.728
we talked about
you letting Gabi start dating.

04:27.728 --> 04:28.769
How'd that go?

04:30.351 --> 04:31.982
I guess it went fine.

04:31.982 --> 04:33.654
I don't feel great about it.

04:33.654 --> 04:35.566
I mean, I want her to be happy,

04:35.566 --> 04:37.448
but I want her to be
happy with me.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.401
Is it hot in here?

04:40.401 --> 04:43.203
That's your follow-up question
at 300 bucks an hour?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.119
-Josh?
-Hm?

04:49.119 --> 04:50.120
Are you staring at me?

04:51.291 --> 04:52.543
No.

04:52.543 --> 04:53.754
Mm-mm.

04:53.754 --> 04:56.256
It's not a crime
to look at my body.

04:56.256 --> 04:58.469
Is it a crime to touch it?
(chuckles)

04:58.469 --> 05:00.801
I'm kidding! I am so kidding.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.182
Which part would
you like to touch?

05:02.182 --> 05:03.303
Can I pick two?

05:04.725 --> 05:05.886
What's happening?

05:05.886 --> 05:07.267
What is happening?

05:08.689 --> 05:10.230
This is so happening.

05:10.230 --> 05:12.483
Oh, God.

05:12.483 --> 05:14.274
Josh!

05:14.274 --> 05:16.437
(both scream)

05:16.437 --> 05:18.779
Oh... Oh, my God.

05:18.779 --> 05:20.571
Oh, it was a dream.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.653
Well, speaking of dreams,

05:22.653 --> 05:24.535
you made mine come true.

05:24.535 --> 05:27.327
Thank you so much
for letting me redo your office.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.869
What?

05:28.869 --> 05:31.291
Wait, you mean
Elliot didn't tell you

05:31.291 --> 05:34.004
about how they raised the rent
on my karaoke bar,

05:34.004 --> 05:36.667
"Me Sing? I Could Never. Okay."

05:36.667 --> 05:39.089
And now I'm pursuing
my passion for interior design,

05:39.089 --> 05:41.341
which my first project is
to redo your office

05:41.341 --> 05:43.263
for a reasonable,
yet generous fee?

05:43.263 --> 05:46.226
Uh... no.

05:46.226 --> 05:48.429
Oy, I can't believe that man.

05:48.429 --> 05:49.930
This is so embarrassing.

05:49.930 --> 05:51.311
I'm horrified...

05:51.311 --> 05:52.733
like you must be
every time you walk

05:52.733 --> 05:55.185
into this hellhole
of an office.

05:55.185 --> 05:56.477
You okay?

05:56.477 --> 05:59.650
Alan... have you ever
been in therapy?

05:59.650 --> 06:03.784
Please. I'm Jewish, gay,
and I witnessed a murder.

06:03.784 --> 06:06.697
Better question is have I ever
been out of therapy.

06:06.697 --> 06:08.989
Okay. I want to talk
to you about something,

06:08.989 --> 06:12.252
but you have to promise
not to say anything to anyone.

06:12.252 --> 06:13.704
Nothing leaves this room...

06:13.704 --> 06:17.498
other than those hideous
leather football helmets,
God willing.

06:17.498 --> 06:19.129
Okay, so...

06:20.961 --> 06:25.506
The dream I was having,
was a sex dream...

06:25.506 --> 06:27.387
about my therapist.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.639
Seriously?

06:28.639 --> 06:30.220
That's nothing to worry about.

06:30.220 --> 06:32.603
I've had sex dreams
about my mother, my rabbi,

06:32.603 --> 06:34.565
you, and that was
all in one dream.

06:34.565 --> 06:36.727
Yeah, but the whole point
of me going to therapy

06:36.727 --> 06:38.689
was to fix my commitment issues
with Gabi.

06:38.689 --> 06:41.612
Gabi's the one I want.
I don't want to start
falling for Dr. Rounds.

06:41.612 --> 06:43.113
Oh, bubala please.

06:43.113 --> 06:46.076
You're not falling for her.
It's called transference.

06:46.076 --> 06:48.449
Your feelings for Gabi are being
projected onto your doctor.

06:48.449 --> 06:49.580
It's all part of the process.

06:49.580 --> 06:50.951
-It is?
-Yes.

06:50.951 --> 06:52.833
It's totally natural.

06:52.833 --> 06:54.795
Unlike this laminate flooring,

06:54.795 --> 06:56.336
which, hello,
you're a millionaire.

06:57.668 --> 06:59.209
So what do I do about it?

06:59.209 --> 07:01.502
This is the whole reason
you're paying a therapist.

07:01.502 --> 07:02.633
You have to tell her
about your dream.

07:02.633 --> 07:04.715
Oh, it's so embarrassing.

07:04.715 --> 07:05.846
Joshua.

07:05.846 --> 07:07.548
Fine, I'll tell her.

07:07.548 --> 07:11.261
And anything you want
to tell me?

07:11.261 --> 07:12.603
You're hired.

07:12.603 --> 07:14.354
What? Me design?

07:14.354 --> 07:15.976
I could never. Okay.

07:21.562 --> 07:23.564
Gabi, tonight was amazing.

07:23.564 --> 07:26.066
You're amazing.
I'm amazing.

07:26.066 --> 07:28.158
Yes, so many things are amazing.

07:28.158 --> 07:29.740
-Well, good night.
-(chuckles)

07:29.740 --> 07:31.782
I know what
that's code for.

07:31.782 --> 07:34.705
"Break me off a piece
of that Conrad."

07:36.877 --> 07:38.919
No. No codes here. Good night.

07:40.501 --> 07:42.753
Hey, hey, hey!

07:42.753 --> 07:44.004
What are you doin'?

07:44.004 --> 07:45.756
Coming in for a "drink."

07:45.756 --> 07:48.719
And just so you know,
I'm not one of those guys

07:48.719 --> 07:50.220
who ditches right after.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.852
I'm a primo cuddler.

07:51.852 --> 07:53.804
You'll find that out soon,
Little Spoon.

07:55.686 --> 07:58.398
Ew. Enough, okay?

07:58.398 --> 08:00.771
I've been trying to be nice,
but you're gross.

08:00.771 --> 08:01.692
You need to leave.

08:01.692 --> 08:03.313
Wait, you're rejecting me?

08:03.313 --> 08:07.157
You used the wrong spelling
of "your" twice in your profile,

08:07.157 --> 08:10.280
but I still thought,
"Hey, let's give the cute,
dumb girl a chance."

08:10.280 --> 08:12.993
Me dumb? You dumb!

08:12.993 --> 08:15.996
That soup you sent back
for being too cold was gazpacho!

08:15.996 --> 08:17.247
You're not a foodie at all!

08:17.247 --> 08:19.620
I bet you just go on
every dating website there is.

08:19.620 --> 08:22.212
Uh, yeah. It's called
a numbers game, dummy.

08:23.674 --> 08:25.505
-See you never!
-See you never-er!

08:28.589 --> 08:30.390
Oh, my God,
I could scream!

08:30.390 --> 08:31.802
(all scream)

08:31.802 --> 08:33.393
What? What? What?

08:33.393 --> 08:34.845
-We just won!
-What?!

08:34.845 --> 08:37.137
Oh, my God,
we won $500 million?

08:37.137 --> 08:40.440
No! We only got five
of the numbers!

08:40.440 --> 08:41.732
So why are we jumping?!

08:41.732 --> 08:45.065
Because we still won $500,000!

08:45.065 --> 08:47.818
Oh, my God! I should have
worn a sports bra too.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.449
So where's the ticket?

08:49.449 --> 08:51.111
Get the freaking ticket!

08:51.111 --> 08:53.323
Relax, okay?

08:53.323 --> 08:54.785
It's right... here.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.577
All:
Oh, my God, oh, my God...

08:56.577 --> 08:59.119
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!

08:59.119 --> 09:00.871
-What, what, what?
-I put the ticket
in the jean jacket

09:00.871 --> 09:02.212
and now the jacket's not here!

09:02.212 --> 09:03.754
The jacket's not here!

09:03.754 --> 09:05.586
(chuckles)

09:05.586 --> 09:07.507
The look on your faces
right now is so great

09:07.507 --> 09:09.720
because what happened was I was
going on my date with Conrad

09:09.720 --> 09:11.882
and I borrowed
Sofia's jean jacket instead,

09:11.882 --> 09:14.805
and that's why
I'm wearing it right now.

09:17.678 --> 09:19.229
I'm not wearing it, am I?

09:25.736 --> 09:26.947
Okay, Conrad's still
not picking up

09:26.947 --> 09:28.398
and his voice mail's full.

09:28.398 --> 09:30.741
And he's not answering
because he hates you.

09:30.741 --> 09:32.823
I hate you.
Everybody hates you.

09:32.823 --> 09:33.954
This is all your fault.

09:33.954 --> 09:37.197
Okay, yes, I left
the jacket in his car.

09:37.197 --> 09:41.752
But in my defense,
who hides a lottery ticket
in a jacket?

09:41.752 --> 09:44.254
Who wears a jean jacket
on a first date, Reba?

09:44.254 --> 09:45.796
Hey! It was raining!

09:45.796 --> 09:49.169
I just found the ugliest
jacket I could find!

09:49.169 --> 09:51.171
Oh, "ugly"? "Ugly"?
Let me tell you something

09:51.171 --> 09:52.673
-about ugly, you jacket thief!
-No, let me...

09:52.673 --> 09:55.515
Stop it, you cackling bitches!

09:56.847 --> 09:58.849
Listen, this is
not my fault, okay?

09:58.849 --> 09:59.890
You know whose fault it is?

09:59.890 --> 10:00.681
Josh's.

10:00.681 --> 10:02.352
If he didn't have
his commitment issues,

10:02.352 --> 10:03.774
which forced me to start dating,

10:03.774 --> 10:04.935
I never would have met Conrad

10:04.935 --> 10:07.688
and I never would have had
to wear Sofia's ugly jacket.

10:07.688 --> 10:08.899
Boom! Josh's fault!

10:08.899 --> 10:10.570
It's not my fault!

10:10.570 --> 10:11.611
It's called transference!

10:13.573 --> 10:14.655
Did Alan say some...

10:15.826 --> 10:17.868
thing? What you guys
talking about?

10:17.868 --> 10:20.330
Somebody lost a lottery ticket.

10:20.330 --> 10:21.411
What are you talking about?

10:21.411 --> 10:22.913
Breakfast.

10:24.414 --> 10:26.086
I want to have breakfast
in my office.

10:26.086 --> 10:28.669
Can you please transference
those scones into my office?

10:33.173 --> 10:34.214
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

10:34.214 --> 10:36.677
Drop the scone
and pick up your phone.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.810
Okay, fine.
But I don't know why

10:39.810 --> 10:42.432
you think after I called him
a thousand times he's just

10:42.432 --> 10:43.934
-suddenly gonna pick up.
-Conrad: Hello?

10:43.934 --> 10:45.435
Conrad!

10:45.435 --> 10:47.728
Hey, I got your 40 messages.

10:47.728 --> 10:48.939
What's up, Desperate?

10:50.901 --> 10:52.482
I can't do this. I hate him.

10:52.482 --> 10:54.444
I hate him. Okay, fine.

10:54.444 --> 10:56.156
Hey, Conrad.

10:56.156 --> 11:00.160
It turns out I-- I'm down
for that... primo cuddle.

11:01.912 --> 11:05.876
So, why don't you drive here
in your car and do that now?

11:07.547 --> 11:10.881
Sorry, Little Spoon,
I'm still in my PJs.

11:10.881 --> 11:13.343
But I would be willing to let
you make me dinner tonight.

11:13.343 --> 11:15.135
And since we're both foodies,

11:15.135 --> 11:17.798
I'll bring you
Conrad's famous cannoli.

11:17.798 --> 11:19.930
Oh, okay. You make cannoli?

11:19.930 --> 11:21.011
Nope.

11:23.143 --> 11:24.224
(beep)

11:29.149 --> 11:30.360
(thunder crashes)

11:30.360 --> 11:31.902
Wow.

11:31.902 --> 11:35.405
That is some storm
out there, huh?

11:35.405 --> 11:38.869
Josh, that's the third time
you've said that.

11:38.869 --> 11:40.951
In your message, you said
you really needed to talk

11:40.951 --> 11:41.912
and asked me to squeeze you in.

11:41.912 --> 11:43.083
(chuckles)

11:43.083 --> 11:45.786
I never said anything
about squeezing anything.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.749
-Josh.
-Fine.

11:51.381 --> 11:53.964
I had... a dream...

11:53.964 --> 11:57.427
that was...

11:57.427 --> 12:02.012
sexual in nature,
involving sex.

12:02.012 --> 12:05.055
Huh. Was anyone else in it?

12:05.055 --> 12:06.807
There was, there was,
there was a woman.

12:08.809 --> 12:11.852
And the woman
who it was was...

12:11.852 --> 12:13.193
(phone rings)

12:13.193 --> 12:15.986
I'm sorry.
It only rings through
if it's an emergency.

12:15.986 --> 12:17.697
-Just a moment.
-(ringing continues)

12:18.949 --> 12:20.360
Hello?

12:21.992 --> 12:23.453
What?

12:23.453 --> 12:26.036
Oh, my God!
I am on my way.

12:26.036 --> 12:27.998
A car skidded in the rain
and hit my dog.

12:27.998 --> 12:30.250
I am sorry. I have to get
to the animal hospital.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.751
-(keys plop)
-Damn it.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.753
-Um, hey, you--
you can't drive like this.
-(groans)

12:33.753 --> 12:35.045
Okay? I'll take you.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.837
It's raining cats
and dogs out there.

12:36.837 --> 12:37.968
I am so sorry.

12:43.884 --> 12:46.016
Sexy! Perfect diversion!

12:46.016 --> 12:47.647
He won't be able to keep
his eyes off of you.

12:47.647 --> 12:50.100
(groans)
Well, as long as he can
keep his hands off of me.

12:50.100 --> 12:53.814
Yeah, well, just keep
picturing $500,000.

12:53.814 --> 12:56.236
-(knocking)
-Oh, my God, he's here.

12:56.236 --> 12:58.778
Just put on that
big, giant smile.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.952
Okay, you have
exactly four minutes

13:01.952 --> 13:03.323
to get his keys
and get into his car

13:03.323 --> 13:04.955
to get the jacket
before I kill...

13:04.955 --> 13:07.037
Conrad!

13:07.037 --> 13:07.958
Hey, doll.

13:07.958 --> 13:09.459
I knew
you'd come crawling back.

13:09.459 --> 13:11.832
Oh, yeah, well,
you know me so well.

13:11.832 --> 13:14.084
(chuckles)
I'm a little creepy crawler.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.126
Yes, you are.

13:16.126 --> 13:18.298
Ha ha, that tickles.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.341
Hello, Conrad.
I'm Sofia, the roommate.

13:21.341 --> 13:23.133
Can I take your jacket?

13:23.133 --> 13:25.095
And the clothes are
coming off already.

13:25.095 --> 13:27.307
(laughs)

13:27.307 --> 13:29.689
(both laugh)

13:29.689 --> 13:31.771
Okay, well, you two have fun.

13:31.771 --> 13:33.483
All right, we will.

13:33.483 --> 13:35.896
You have fun doing
whatever you're doing
as fast as you possibly can!

13:35.896 --> 13:37.027
(door closes)

13:41.071 --> 13:42.863
It's not up here!

13:42.863 --> 13:44.074
You guys find anything?

13:44.074 --> 13:46.576
No. There's nothing back here.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.949
Yolanda? Aah!

13:48.949 --> 13:50.160
(muffled screams)

13:52.122 --> 13:54.254
Ew, licorice.

13:54.254 --> 13:55.295
What the hell?!

13:55.295 --> 13:58.128
I get low blood sugar.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.920
You ever hear
of a purse, bitch?

14:04.965 --> 14:06.596
So, Conrad...

14:08.098 --> 14:10.020
can I get you anything?

14:10.020 --> 14:13.103
Um, beer, wine, or...

14:13.103 --> 14:15.475
we could just do shots
till you pass out.

14:15.475 --> 14:18.108
Trying to get me drunk.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.940
I know that game.

14:19.940 --> 14:21.942
You wanna kiss me,
don't you?

14:21.942 --> 14:23.243
I don't...

14:24.824 --> 14:26.036
wanna rush it.

14:26.036 --> 14:29.409
No, I'm the kind of girl
that likes to get to know
a guy first.

14:29.409 --> 14:32.082
I'm 28, I run
an online clothing store,

14:32.082 --> 14:33.453
and I love Billy Joel.

14:33.453 --> 14:35.255
Let's do this.

14:35.255 --> 14:36.957
(phone chimes)

14:36.957 --> 14:38.498
Oh, damn it.

14:38.498 --> 14:39.960
Problem, babe?

14:39.960 --> 14:42.052
Uh, no. No problem.

14:42.052 --> 14:44.094
It's just that I borrowed
my roommate's jacket

14:44.094 --> 14:45.966
for our date last night
and now she can't find it.

14:45.966 --> 14:47.807
Oh, you left it in my car.

14:47.807 --> 14:50.180
But it's not
in your car. Probably.

14:52.222 --> 14:54.814
That's right.
I brought it up to my place.

14:54.814 --> 14:56.226
But here's a plan.

14:56.226 --> 14:59.569
You can get it
on our third date...

14:59.569 --> 15:01.731
so you don't get cold
the next morning.

15:01.731 --> 15:04.114
(chuckles)
Can't wait for that.

15:04.114 --> 15:07.197
So where do you live exactly?

15:07.197 --> 15:09.579
Okay, this is Conrad's place.

15:09.579 --> 15:10.991
Yolanda, you guard the door,

15:10.991 --> 15:12.292
Elliot, you watch out
for neighbors.

15:12.292 --> 15:14.084
-I'll get the jacket.
-Oh, screw that.

15:14.084 --> 15:15.245
We're coming in
to help you look.

15:15.245 --> 15:16.916
Yolanda, it's a jean jacket.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.248
How hard can it be to find?

15:22.882 --> 15:24.634
Oh, my damn.

15:24.634 --> 15:26.046
Oh, my denim.

15:31.051 --> 15:33.974
So you wanna do it
Lady and the Tramp style?

15:35.895 --> 15:37.267
Oh, you mean,
like, each taking

15:37.267 --> 15:39.019
the ends of the spaghetti
in our mouths?

15:39.019 --> 15:40.650
Nope.

15:40.650 --> 15:41.651
(slurps)

15:47.027 --> 15:48.198
(phone rings)

15:48.198 --> 15:50.700
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have to take this.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.994
It's my... chael Bolton.

15:57.417 --> 15:59.339
Hey, Michael.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.923
Gabi, I'm looking at literally
a thousand denim jackets.

16:03.923 --> 16:06.296
It's like the clothing store
from Brokeback Mountain.

16:08.298 --> 16:10.350
Elliot:
Oh, my God! Look at this!

16:10.350 --> 16:11.971
Hold on. I think Elliot
might have found it.

16:16.266 --> 16:19.059
Subtly studded
with breakaway sleeves.

16:21.101 --> 16:23.403
Viola! It's a vest!

16:23.403 --> 16:26.156
I can't quit it.

16:26.156 --> 16:28.818
Oh, let me see those.

16:28.818 --> 16:30.070
Thank you.

16:30.070 --> 16:32.202
Find! The! Jacket! Fool!

16:33.703 --> 16:35.955
Okay, well, hurry.
Please hurry.

16:38.878 --> 16:40.210
Is there a problem?

16:40.210 --> 16:43.713
Oh, no. My friend is just
having a little trouble.

16:43.713 --> 16:46.676
Finding this?

16:46.676 --> 16:47.797
(gasps)

16:47.797 --> 16:49.089
(thunder crashes)

16:53.343 --> 16:56.306
I can't believe
Sigmund's still in surgery.

16:56.306 --> 16:59.099
Look, I know it's hard,
but you should really
try to relax.

16:59.099 --> 17:01.231
Hey! Usually it's you
saying that to me.

17:03.813 --> 17:07.567
I know it's cliché,
but he's my best friend.

17:08.738 --> 17:10.530
You know what would help me
get my mind off things?

17:10.530 --> 17:12.362
If we continued
with your session.

17:14.114 --> 17:16.456
Right here, right now?

17:16.456 --> 17:19.209
It would help me focus on
something other than Sigmund.

17:19.209 --> 17:20.250
Please?

17:20.250 --> 17:21.371
Okay.

17:23.123 --> 17:25.165
So... (sighs)

17:25.165 --> 17:27.667
like I was saying,
I've been having this...

17:27.667 --> 17:30.220
sexual dream about...

17:30.220 --> 17:31.301
I'm sorry!

17:31.301 --> 17:32.762
(sobs)

17:38.348 --> 17:39.599
Thank you.

17:42.232 --> 17:44.734
Oh, my God, you had
that ticket the whole time?!

17:44.734 --> 17:47.187
Why didn't you just go cash it?!
Why would you make me sit

17:47.187 --> 17:49.279
through this whole night
with you with your gross

17:49.279 --> 17:51.361
come-ons
and your sleazy innuendos

17:51.361 --> 17:54.244
and your fog
of Euro-trash body spray?!

17:57.197 --> 17:58.748
Gabi, Gabi, Gabi.

17:58.748 --> 18:00.079
I did it for this.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.251
For what?!

18:01.251 --> 18:02.792
To watch you squirm.

18:02.792 --> 18:04.204
I liked you, Gabi.

18:04.204 --> 18:07.167
I liked you a lot
and you threw it all away.

18:07.167 --> 18:10.420
Let this be a $500,000 lesson.

18:10.420 --> 18:11.841
Hasta la bye-bye.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.134
No, no, no. Hey, hey!
No! You're not leaving
with that ticket.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.885
Oh, you're gonna stop me?

18:15.885 --> 18:17.307
You and what army?

18:18.768 --> 18:20.980
-Where is it?
-Give us our ticket.

18:22.722 --> 18:25.855
Let me ask you something, buddy.

18:25.855 --> 18:26.856
Does this come in white?

18:28.358 --> 18:30.360
Everybody back off!

18:30.360 --> 18:32.282
There's no way any of you
are getting this ticket.

18:32.282 --> 18:34.694
And there is no way
I'd ever choke you out,

18:34.694 --> 18:37.157
wrap you in a shower curtain,
and dump you in the East Bay.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.203
Fine. You want it?

18:43.203 --> 18:45.124
Come and get it.

18:47.457 --> 18:49.088
I'm out.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.172
I'm in. Ladies.

18:54.554 --> 18:56.135
(screams)

18:58.848 --> 19:00.350
Run, Elliot!

19:00.350 --> 19:01.221
Work those stubby--

19:01.221 --> 19:03.893
You're never getting
this ticket from my hands!

19:03.893 --> 19:05.315
-Never!
-Oh, no?

19:05.315 --> 19:06.526
(chuckles)
Oh!

19:06.526 --> 19:08.438
(chuckles)
It's mine!

19:08.438 --> 19:10.230
You'll never see
this ticket again!

19:10.230 --> 19:11.361
I'm rich!

19:11.361 --> 19:12.532
(thunder crashes)

19:12.532 --> 19:15.154
All:
Nooooo!

19:19.779 --> 19:23.283
So this ticket is gone forever,

19:23.283 --> 19:26.246
and yet Conrad came out
relatively unscathed.

19:26.246 --> 19:27.707
That seems fair.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.921
-(phone chimes)
-Well, looks like
Conrad is doing better.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.884
He just sent me a picture
of him high-fouring the nurse.

19:36.256 --> 19:38.258
Okay, can we just,
like, take a moment

19:38.258 --> 19:40.350
to reflect on
what happened tonight?

19:40.350 --> 19:42.101
I mean, the chances
of winning the lottery

19:42.101 --> 19:45.184
are, like, one in a gazillion,
and then the chances

19:45.184 --> 19:47.066
of lightning
striking that ticket

19:47.066 --> 19:49.229
are, like, one in a kajillion,

19:49.229 --> 19:51.361
but both of those things
happening at the same time,

19:51.361 --> 19:54.073
that will never happen again.

19:54.073 --> 19:55.695
Exactly.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.447
Do you know what that means?

19:57.447 --> 19:59.529
That I'm not getting a boat.

20:01.321 --> 20:03.953
No, that lighting
doesn't strike twice,

20:03.953 --> 20:06.205
and there aren't a million
Joshes in the sea.

20:07.497 --> 20:09.419
Sofia, I'm not dating anymore.

20:09.419 --> 20:11.881
Okay? I'm waiting for Josh.

20:11.881 --> 20:13.383
I don't care
how long it takes.

20:14.924 --> 20:16.836
He's my one in a million.

20:21.301 --> 20:23.102
(footsteps)

20:23.102 --> 20:25.054
Jessica Rounds?

20:25.054 --> 20:26.646
That's me.

20:26.646 --> 20:28.438
-How is he?
-He's out of surgery.

20:28.438 --> 20:30.730
A couple of broken bones,
but he's gonna be just fine.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.151
Oh, thank God!

20:32.151 --> 20:33.353
(squeals)

20:33.353 --> 20:34.564
(both cheer)

20:34.564 --> 20:36.946
Thank you so much
for being there for me.

20:45.785 --> 20:47.417
(thunder rumbling)

20:57.256 --> 20:58.428
(thunder rumbling)

20:58.428 --> 21:01.050
I'm really sorry you didn't get
that lottery ticket.

21:01.050 --> 21:04.514
(sighs) We just could have
really used the money.

21:04.514 --> 21:07.307
Thank God you found your calling
in interior design.

21:07.307 --> 21:08.978
Um, my little calling...

21:08.978 --> 21:10.890
heh, I should've hung up.

21:10.890 --> 21:12.442
It's a disaster.

21:12.442 --> 21:14.654
What do you think about
me becoming a therapist?

21:14.654 --> 21:16.155
Stop it.

21:16.155 --> 21:18.277
I bet it's gorgeous.
Let me be the judge.

21:20.490 --> 21:22.612
You're gonna make
an amazing therapist!
