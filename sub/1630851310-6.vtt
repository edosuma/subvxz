00:06.250 --> 00:11.400
Victim is Mr Arnie Rahul.
Consultant surgeon. 48 years of age.

00:11.500 --> 00:14.200
Good reputation, though he's fallen
out with a few people recently.

00:14.201 --> 00:16.301
He was about to start an operation.
He gets a phone call.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.820
Walks out, never comes back.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.040
Single puncture wound to
the left chest wall.

00:23.240 --> 00:26.040
What's that in his hand?
Looks like a syringe and needle.

00:26.040 --> 00:29.280
It's a Hickman line.
A long-term vascular access device

00:29.280 --> 00:31.800
for people who need chemotherapy
or blood transfusions.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.520
The assailant would have had
extensive cross contamination

00:34.520 --> 00:36.000
with the victim's blood.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.160
Stick that in to a big artery
and blood will flow out

00:38.160 --> 00:39.720
like a high-pressure hose.

00:39.720 --> 00:41.080
Simi Jacobs.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.520
He's denying everything.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.840
Simi Jacobs is not a match

00:47.840 --> 00:49.480
to the blood spatter at the scene.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.760
So, who is it? It's Wilfred Okoye.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.880
The patient?

00:52.880 --> 00:56.640
Arnie Rahul was murdered by a man
who was under general anaesthetic

00:56.640 --> 00:58.040
in a different room?

00:58.040 --> 01:01.680
Blood alcohol level, three times
the legal driving limit.

01:01.680 --> 01:04.000
You said he shouldn't be operating.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Not after the Harry Fletcher
incident.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.920
Arrested on the table
during surgery last week.

01:08.920 --> 01:11.560
I want you to do the postmortem.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.760
Technically that would be
a conflict of interest.

01:13.760 --> 01:17.040
Summarising postmortem examination,
Harry Fletcher.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.960
What are you doing?
My colleagues are here.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.920
Is that Emily Braithwaite?
She's Adam's godmother.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.040
You'd think he might have
mentioned it.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.560
Are you going to confront him?
Not yet.

01:26.560 --> 01:29.000
Your original stem cell work
was brilliant.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.880
But you tried and failed to turn
it into a viable cancer treatment.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.440
Wilfred Okoye, still in
the hospital.

01:35.440 --> 01:37.120
What's he going to know?

01:37.120 --> 01:40.080
You won't find out unless you
ask him.

01:40.080 --> 01:42.960
Mr Fletcher died because of
surgical error.

01:42.960 --> 01:46.520
Adam! You have no idea what
you've done.

01:46.520 --> 01:49.040
When I applied for this job
I falsified my CV,

01:49.040 --> 01:50.920
and Emily Braithwaite tried to
use this

01:50.920 --> 01:53.200
fact to influence my findings in
the Fletcher Case.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.880
Here's my letter of resignation.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.160
Effective immediately.

01:57.680 --> 02:03.720
# Testator silens

02:06.240 --> 02:13.400
# Costestes e spiritu

02:13.400 --> 02:20.880
# Silencium

02:28.200 --> 02:34.000
# Testator silens. #

02:45.520 --> 02:49.080
Wilfred Okoye, a Beninese
farm worker, was admitted

02:49.080 --> 02:53.240
to St Jude's hospital for the
treatment of leukaemia a week ago.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.640
Although he lost consciousness
briefly during the attack

02:56.640 --> 03:00.320
on his life last night, he seems to
have recovered with no ill effects.

03:00.320 --> 03:04.640
Awaiting toxicology from the syringe
we believe was used in the attack.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.400
Prints? Fibres?

03:06.400 --> 03:08.680
Nothing conclusive.
We're interviewing witnesses

03:08.680 --> 03:10.840
but no-one got a good look at
the attacker.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.360
How come he's being treated here
in the UK?

03:13.360 --> 03:17.200
It was set up by a charity,
and then arranged through Rahul.

03:18.800 --> 03:23.040
Here is a man who has lived his
entire life in Benin

03:23.040 --> 03:27.240
up until a week ago, and,
according to our DNA evidence,

03:27.240 --> 03:31.520
murders his surgeon while under
anaesthetic in a different room.

03:35.120 --> 03:40.720
Could the DNA at the murder scene
been a contaminant or planted?

03:40.720 --> 03:43.480
No. The spatter patterns are
too perfect.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.840
It came from someone who
was in the room at the time.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.480
So, how do you explain it?

03:50.800 --> 03:53.880
How do we know Wilfred
was anaesthetised?

03:53.880 --> 03:56.680
I mean, how do we know it was him?

03:56.680 --> 03:58.320
What, he's got an identical twin?

03:58.320 --> 03:59.800
Bit fantastical, Steve.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.640
I don't know.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.240
There's another explanation.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.440
DNA samples got mixed up.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.440
Ah! No way!

04:09.440 --> 04:12.640
Look, I'm just putting it out there.
Mm-mn. We could run the test again.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.640
Those samples were
handled correctly.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.280
Jack, shall we just run them again?

04:21.560 --> 04:23.320
Right, yep. Good.

04:24.560 --> 04:25.600
OK.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.720
Let me know when toxicology
comes back.

04:37.040 --> 04:40.520
So, the samples got mixed up,
did they? It's always possible.

04:40.520 --> 04:41.560
Mm-hm.

04:42.560 --> 04:45.800
You know who took the swab from
Simi Jacobs. Adam.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.560
What are you suggesting?

04:50.600 --> 04:52.080
Just saying.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.640
 You have reached
Dr Adam Yuen.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.240
I am unable to take your call.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.200
Please leave a message
after the tone.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.560
Do you know what I don't understand?

05:11.560 --> 05:13.760
It was just a six-month placement,

05:13.760 --> 05:16.400
and his CV is impressive
enough without it.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.560
So, why did he risk his career
and lie about it?

05:22.520 --> 05:24.840
Has he lied about anything else?

05:24.840 --> 05:27.360
Everything else checks out.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.840
Are you sure about that?

05:32.280 --> 05:35.960
You have an injury over your
left eye and a wound on your neck.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.400
How do you account for them, Simi?

05:40.640 --> 05:42.120
Yeah, I got mugged.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.560
A kid with a knife. Really?

05:46.320 --> 05:48.600
And did you report the assault?

05:48.600 --> 05:51.160
No. Why not?

05:51.160 --> 05:52.760
What, are you going to catch him?

05:54.920 --> 05:58.240
He's answered your questions,
so unless you have other evidence?

06:21.480 --> 06:24.880
Tox results from the syringe
used in the attack on Wilfred.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.640
Here we go. Let's have a look.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.960
That's it? Midazolam?

06:36.200 --> 06:38.400
That's a sedative, isn't it?

06:38.400 --> 06:39.440
Yeah.

06:41.600 --> 06:45.680
The full syringe would have had
about five milligrams in it.

06:45.680 --> 06:46.800
That's not very much.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.920
So, either the assailant
is incompetent,

06:51.920 --> 06:54.200
or this wasn't intended to kill him.

06:55.720 --> 06:58.600
So, what's the aim?

06:58.600 --> 07:00.240
Kidnapping?

07:05.080 --> 07:07.200
The guy's already ill.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.520
You know...

07:09.520 --> 07:13.480
If someone wanted him dead, it's not
going to be that hard, is it?

07:13.480 --> 07:14.800
He's got leukaemia.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.400
It would look like natural causes
if he died of sepsis.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.960
Should I get that syringe tested
again for bacteria?

07:31.720 --> 07:34.320
What's this about Mr Okoye
being moved?

07:34.320 --> 07:35.760
It's for his own safety.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.440
To the Cowley Institute?
And who's paying for that?

07:38.440 --> 07:41.400
Oh, I've been assured that they have
all the facilities required,

07:41.400 --> 07:44.160
and they've offered to do
the treatment free of charge.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.560
I will not allow it.

07:45.560 --> 07:48.800
Someone in your hospital is trying
to kill Mr Okoye.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.480
Quite frankly, Dr Braithwaite,
I don't need your permission.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.360
Haematology lab.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.760
Dr Braithwaite here.

08:10.760 --> 08:15.560
Wilfred Okoye, hospital number
1187266.

08:15.560 --> 08:18.080
I want all his stored blood
and marrow samples sent

08:18.080 --> 08:19.720
to my office immediately.

08:46.880 --> 08:49.000
Finished!

08:49.000 --> 08:53.760
79 needles swabbed and ready to go.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.680
You've got to see this.

08:57.680 --> 08:59.680
Microbiology results from
the syringe

08:59.680 --> 09:01.920
used in the attack on Wilfred.

09:01.920 --> 09:05.160
Turns out it is full of bacteria -
E coli.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.080
Well, it was lying around on
the floor.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.360
Could it be a contaminant?

09:10.360 --> 09:13.040
No. It's a pure growth -
just one type of bug in there.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.920
If it was a contaminant
you'd expect to see

09:14.920 --> 09:16.680
lots of different organisms.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.320
It's been created deliberately.

09:19.560 --> 09:23.320
So, what? The killer sneaks into
Wilfred's room pretending

09:23.320 --> 09:26.880
to be a nurse, inoculates him with
the bacteria,

09:26.880 --> 09:28.240
but adds a mild sedative...

09:30.440 --> 09:33.280
..so that when the real nurse comes
in with his medication,

09:33.280 --> 09:36.880
he's asleep and can't tell her that
someone else has already been in.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.800
He gets sepsis, he dies.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.280
Looks like natural causes.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.560
I need to tell DI Cracknell.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.160
You need to tell the doctors
looking after Wilfred.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.360
It's as we expected - extensive
peripheral oedema,

10:43.360 --> 10:46.680
multiple organ failure,
consistent with sepsis.

10:46.680 --> 10:50.680
Yep. Toxicology shows only
medications used for his treatment,

10:50.680 --> 10:54.160
antibiotics, ceftriaxone,
gentamicin present

10:54.160 --> 10:55.880
in therapeutic concentrations.

10:55.880 --> 10:59.240
So, cause of death is consistent
with deliberate inoculation

10:59.240 --> 11:02.120
of the culture of E coli,
on a background

11:02.120 --> 11:05.520
of chemotherapy-induced
immune compromise.

11:05.520 --> 11:08.640
Well, we've got no other
leads on his attacker at present.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.040
We're liaising with
the Beninese Consulate to inform

11:11.040 --> 11:13.640
the family of the deceased.

11:13.640 --> 11:19.000
DNA says Wilfred Okoye was guilty of
Rahul's murder,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.360
but being unconscious,
had the perfect alibi.

11:23.040 --> 11:26.040
When a murder suspect gets murdered,
what does that mean?

11:26.040 --> 11:27.760
Framed by the real murderer?

11:27.760 --> 11:30.360
Why would you frame someone with
the perfect alibi?

11:36.560 --> 11:38.760
Simi Jacobs.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.440
What's his home address?

11:40.440 --> 11:41.480
Erm...

11:43.320 --> 11:47.080
Let's see. Flat 32, Bardwell House,
Lincoln Street.

11:47.080 --> 11:50.720
Thought so. Okoye and Jacobs have
been living together.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.920
Simi Jacobs has already been
released, guv.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.520
What? Yeah. Lack of forensics.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.000
All right.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Might I suggest we pick
him up again?

12:07.160 --> 12:09.240
It still doesn't get us anywhere.

12:09.240 --> 12:11.000
It doesn't explain the DNA.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.400
And Simi was in custody
when Wilfred was attacked,

12:13.400 --> 12:14.800
so it doesn't even explain that.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.280
We're just going round in
circles. Yep.

12:28.160 --> 12:31.320
When he was interviewed,
Wilfred said his leukaemia

12:31.320 --> 12:34.000
was common in his region.

12:36.640 --> 12:38.000
Doesn't sound right to me.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.880
 You have reached
Dr Adam Yuen.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.320
I am unable to take your call.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.280
Please leave a message
after the tone.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.160
Wait there. He's not in, guv.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.840
And the neighbours haven't seen him.

13:06.840 --> 13:09.120
He's not been seen back at work
at the hospital either.

13:09.120 --> 13:12.000
You two stick around in case
he comes back.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.240
I'm sorry, guv. I should
have spotted the address.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.000
Don't worry about it.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.160
At least you didn't wrongly arrest
a bereaved cancer patient.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.040
I'll do that next time.

13:32.360 --> 13:33.400
Bye.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.600
Nine missed calls.
You're very persistent.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.240
I didn't want to end it like that.

13:47.880 --> 13:49.560
Can I help?

14:00.560 --> 14:03.600
You should have told me that
Emily Braithwaite is your godmother.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.520
Some godmother.

14:05.520 --> 14:08.120
No doubt you've received
the incriminating evidence about me.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.320
What evidence?

14:10.960 --> 14:13.720
She never sent it.
I should have guessed.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.880
If she tried to blackmail you,
then we'll make her answer for that.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.000
She's far too clever.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.880
Why do I think there's more to this
than you're telling me?

14:24.600 --> 14:26.840
No, I just lied to advance
my career.

14:26.840 --> 14:29.880
Really? Just to say you had a
fellowship. Why would you do that?

14:35.440 --> 14:36.960
My family are all doctors.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.960
I was always going to be a surgeon.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.680
It was more or less decided for me.

14:42.560 --> 14:45.680
Final year of medical school,
I was walking to uni

14:45.680 --> 14:48.920
and a cyclist is knocked off her
bike, right in front of me.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.760
Now, I was a keen student.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.840
I used to carry
a first aid kit around with me.

14:53.840 --> 14:57.520
If I'm honest, I was always waiting
for something like this.

14:57.520 --> 15:00.920
When I think about that it's
actually what I'm most ashamed of.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.200
She had facial injuries.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.840
Heavy, laboured breathing.
She was losing consciousness fast.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.760
So, I thought, "She's suffocating.

15:07.760 --> 15:12.120
"She needs a surgical airway,
a cricothyroidotomy."

15:12.120 --> 15:13.480
So, I made my incision.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.000
Something that I had
practised on mannequins.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.160
What I didn't know is that she had
an abnormal anatomy -

15:20.160 --> 15:23.600
an aberrant subclavian artery,
looping high in the neck.

15:24.760 --> 15:28.080
It's present in 1% of people
and 0% of mannequins.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.480
How could you have known?
It was a bloodbath.

15:38.160 --> 15:41.000
The artery retracted back into
her chest.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.600
There was nothing we could do
to save her.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.760
She bled to death in minutes.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.720
My father was furious.

15:54.400 --> 15:57.080
Not because I stupidly tried
a tracheostomy

15:57.080 --> 15:58.840
and killed an innocent young girl.

16:00.440 --> 16:04.240
But because I didn't study hard
enough to do it competently.

16:06.480 --> 16:10.960
So, he used his influence
and arranged for my fellowship

16:10.960 --> 16:12.720
as cover. For what?

16:16.640 --> 16:18.120
For my absence.

16:21.440 --> 16:24.720
It took months of therapy before
I could even leave the house.

16:33.480 --> 16:37.080
The irony in all of this is that
the one who helped me out

16:37.080 --> 16:38.760
the most was Emily Braithwaite.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.800
She visited me more often than
my parents.

16:45.840 --> 16:47.080
She understood.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.320
But there was no way I was going
to be a surgeon.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.640
So, I decided to choose pathology,

16:58.640 --> 17:02.520
and a false narrative was created as
to why I made the switch.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.120
When you start lying,

17:07.120 --> 17:09.400
you have to keep lying.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.240
Jack. Mm? I need to talk to you.

17:31.240 --> 17:32.600
Sure, what's up...?

17:35.120 --> 17:36.520
Hi.

17:36.520 --> 17:37.640
Are you kidding me?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.360
He doesn't work here any more
because he lied to us, do you

17:43.360 --> 17:46.080
remember? Do you remember that?
Adam's got a theory about Wilfred.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.640
Oh, right. Just hear him out.

17:47.640 --> 17:51.640
So, um, I just have to trust
him now?

17:51.640 --> 17:53.640
No, you've got to trust me.

17:57.520 --> 17:58.640
Think about it.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.600
Why would someone want Wilfred dead?

18:02.600 --> 18:04.880
What did he know that was such
a threat that someone

18:04.880 --> 18:05.920
had to kill him?

18:07.560 --> 18:11.000
Wilfred was being treated for acute
myeloid leukaemia.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.240
That's rare.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.760
Remember, he said there were
lots of other cases in his small

18:14.760 --> 18:16.960
village in Africa.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.680
What if Wilfred wasn't killed
because of what he knew?

18:19.680 --> 18:20.840
Don't follow.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.640
Wilfred wasn't the witness.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.120
He was the evidence.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.000
This is a trephine biopsy of
the bone marrow.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.720
We take a thin core of bone
with marrow cells in it.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.040
I've already taken an aspirate of
the fluids.

18:49.280 --> 18:52.760
So, the question is, why would so
many people from one place

18:52.760 --> 18:54.160
all get leukaemia?

18:55.400 --> 18:57.240
And that's going to tell you, is it?

18:57.240 --> 18:59.080
To be honest, I've never done
this before.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.080
Not postmortem, anyway.

19:01.080 --> 19:04.240
But you know what? It's crazy
enough for it to work. Mm-mm.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.040
Thanks.

19:19.080 --> 19:22.440
Oh, look. Here's a billion
DNA results from the needles.

19:24.040 --> 19:27.000
Want to give me a hand going
through these?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.160
Didn't think so.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.840
Nikki? The slide's ready when you
want to have a look.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.880
Good yield of cells.
More than I expected.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.320
Definitely acute myeloid leukaemia.

20:02.320 --> 20:05.800
It's not typical.
Looks more like secondary AML.

20:05.800 --> 20:08.520
Secondary to what?
A toxin of some sort.

20:08.520 --> 20:10.560
Some industrial chemical,
for example,

20:10.560 --> 20:14.560
or chemotherapy for
a different cancer.

20:14.560 --> 20:17.440
Right. And that can occur years
after the original exposure.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.440
Decades, in some cases.

20:19.440 --> 20:23.000
So, there may be other victims,
all exposed to the same thing?

20:25.040 --> 20:26.400
Makes sense.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.440
Can I help you?

20:46.440 --> 20:48.480
They told me Wilfred is here.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.320
Can I see him, yeah?

20:50.320 --> 20:52.520
Er, you are? Family.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.360
Do you want to take a seat?

20:56.360 --> 20:59.560
Will I be able to sit with him
for a bit or...? I'll just check.

21:09.040 --> 21:11.360
I've found Rahul's murder weapon.

21:11.360 --> 21:15.120
One DNA profile matching Rahul,
one matching Wilfred,

21:15.120 --> 21:16.880
just like we found at the scene.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.880
But there's a third profile.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.760
Yep. Simi Jacobs.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.800
Simi? He's here!

21:24.800 --> 21:27.720
What do you mean he's here?
He wants to see Wilfred's body.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.600
This places Simi at the scene
of Rahul's murder.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.600
We need to keep him here.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.200
Call DI Cracknell.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.600
So, hang on. Simi Jacobs just
turned up at the lab.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.760
One needle injected into
three people.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.200
Better get down here.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.200
Simi had a puncture wound
to his neck.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.160
Rahul was stabbed in the chest,
but Wilfred?

22:04.160 --> 22:05.960
And if Simi got in a fight
with Rahul,

22:05.960 --> 22:07.920
why is Wilfred's blood spattered?

22:07.920 --> 22:10.600
Wilfred would have to have
been in the room as well.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.600
Maybe he was. Genetically speaking.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.440
What if that needle only stabbed
two people?

22:16.440 --> 22:19.320
Then one of them has two different
types of DNA. Exactly.

22:19.320 --> 22:20.880
Huh? No, for that to work, it would

22:20.880 --> 22:23.600
mean Simi's walking around with
Wilfred's blood inside him.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.480
That's ridiculous. Is it?

22:27.600 --> 22:30.760
Bone marrow transplant.
And Wilfred was the donor.

22:30.760 --> 22:34.560
So, Simi's blood has Wilfred's DNA.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.800
Do you want to come this way? Yeah.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.320
Just there.

22:52.400 --> 22:55.160
Can I get you a tea?
A glass of water or...?

22:55.160 --> 22:57.040
Oh, no, no!

22:57.040 --> 22:58.080
Thanks.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.440
You said that Wilfred was family?

23:03.440 --> 23:05.200
That's right.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.840
Was he a close relative?

23:08.480 --> 23:10.800
You ask a lot of questions.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.480
Remember me?

23:14.280 --> 23:16.400
I examined you at the station.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.720
I saw a scar on your chest.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.360
That's a Hickman line scar.

23:20.960 --> 23:23.280
Did you have a bone marrow
transplant as a kid?

23:24.720 --> 23:26.520
Yeah, I'm going to go.

23:26.520 --> 23:29.360
Simi, we found your blood at
the scene of Rahul's murder.

23:31.360 --> 23:32.600
Did you kill him?

23:35.440 --> 23:40.120
No, no, no. He... He came at me!
He was insane!

23:40.120 --> 23:41.440
It was an accident!

23:45.520 --> 23:47.240
I just wanted to protect Wilfred.

23:49.400 --> 23:52.200
Wilfred saved my life
when I was a kid.

23:52.200 --> 23:55.240
But you know what? He could only do
that because he was a match.

23:55.240 --> 23:58.120
People have transplants from their
brothers or mothers or whatever

23:58.120 --> 24:01.040
because they're a match.
I had no-one.

24:02.440 --> 24:05.520
How did you find him? There's this
charity attached to our church.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.520
They helped us get
the transplant records.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.240
Only it turns out Wilfred was sick.

24:12.440 --> 24:14.640
Were there others? Yeah.

24:14.640 --> 24:17.680
I mean, loads of people in his
village died from the same thing.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.320
We found Wilfred in time.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.320
So we thought.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.400
What?

24:29.400 --> 24:31.120
You're not going to let me see him?

24:35.200 --> 24:37.920
Simi.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.160
There he is.

24:59.680 --> 25:03.120
Ah, afternoon! Present from
DI Cracknell -

25:03.120 --> 25:05.960
all the rubbish from
Simi Jacobs' address.

25:05.960 --> 25:07.440
Thought you might want to take
a look

25:07.440 --> 25:09.240
in case you find anything relevant.

25:09.240 --> 25:13.600
Joy. Can I introduce Reverend Kanu?
You've already met Jack.

25:13.600 --> 25:17.640
This is Dr Nikki Alexander
and Dr Adam Yuen. Hello.

25:17.640 --> 25:21.040
Reverend Kanu runs the charitable
organisation that was responsible

25:21.040 --> 25:22.920
for bringing Wilfred to the UK.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.720
I have some photos from our trip.

25:24.720 --> 25:28.440
Sergeant Galloway thinks
they might help you. Thank you.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.880
I have to warn you,
they're not pretty.

25:34.040 --> 25:36.280
Tell me how Mr Okoye came to
be here.

25:37.880 --> 25:42.080
My church runs a charity that helps
arrange treatment in the UK.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.880
They raise money, get doctors to
volunteer, whatever.

25:46.360 --> 25:48.720
Wilfred's case was kind of special.

25:48.720 --> 25:52.400
I mean, he helped me years ago,
and now he needed my help.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.720
The local newspaper picked up
the story, it got a lot

25:54.720 --> 25:58.120
of publicity. So, the hospital
agreed to treat him.

25:58.120 --> 26:00.600
And he stayed at your flat? Yeah.

26:02.840 --> 26:05.720
Nobody told me he don't
speak English.

26:05.720 --> 26:08.560
I couldn't tell him anything.

26:08.560 --> 26:11.800
He didn't know who I was,
what he did for me.

26:14.160 --> 26:16.960
Then I learnt that he's under
the care of this Rahul guy.

26:18.800 --> 26:23.600
I have travelled widely in Africa
as part of my ministry,

26:23.600 --> 26:28.480
and yet nothing could have prepared
me for what we found in Bwendora.

26:31.360 --> 26:34.640
The town is remote, even by
African standards.

26:36.120 --> 26:39.360
There is only very basic
health care.

26:39.360 --> 26:42.160
It became clear there was a
lot of sickness.

26:43.960 --> 26:46.760
This man died within hours of
our arrival.

26:47.920 --> 26:52.360
The illness causes bleeding
and rashes. Fever sometimes.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.520
What do the people think it's
caused by?

26:54.520 --> 26:57.640
There's a large pesticide factory
in the town.

26:57.640 --> 27:00.800
Many people think the water has
been contaminated.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.760
They organised protests.

27:03.760 --> 27:06.720
People think there has been
a cover-up.

27:06.720 --> 27:09.120
But the factory provides
a lot of employment.

27:10.480 --> 27:14.200
It is a very divisive issue.

27:14.200 --> 27:18.920
The illness has ripped the heart
out of the community.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.960
There are very few families it has
left untouched.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.920
And they've had no outside help?

27:23.920 --> 27:27.160
There is one western charity
which runs a clinic,

27:27.160 --> 27:29.040
but they only visit every
few months.

27:31.680 --> 27:32.880
Some charity.

27:35.680 --> 27:37.840
Oh, Lord.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.760
Enlighten our minds with your truth.

27:42.080 --> 27:45.240
Give us the strength and the wisdom
to seek justice.

27:46.920 --> 27:50.720
Shine your everlasting light into
our darkness.

27:53.080 --> 27:56.480
There's a lot of talk about Rahul,
all around the hospital.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.920
How the hospital is protecting him.

27:58.920 --> 28:02.360
How he messed up an operation
and no-one wants to work with him.

28:02.360 --> 28:05.080
And you thought he shouldn't operate
on Wilfred.

28:05.080 --> 28:09.080
The night before, I heard him
arguing with this woman,

28:09.080 --> 28:11.200
Dr Braithwaite.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.280
She told Rahul not to do
the operation

28:13.280 --> 28:16.080
and he just told her that
she couldn't stop him.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.600
The bag of rubbish that we
found at your home address.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.600
Was it from one of the offices?

28:20.600 --> 28:22.040
Yeah. Which one?

28:23.120 --> 28:24.520
All of them.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.960
I was looking for
something, anything,

28:26.960 --> 28:28.800
I could use against Rahul.

28:28.800 --> 28:31.280
And on the morning of the operation?

28:31.280 --> 28:34.240
I saw Wilfred getting prepared for
theatre and I panicked.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.000
I phoned Rahul.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.480
What did you say?

28:37.480 --> 28:39.840
I told him I had some information
on him.

28:39.840 --> 28:43.960
I thought I could threaten to reveal
what I knew if he did the operation.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.160
What information?

28:47.680 --> 28:50.760
I was bluffing. But I had
to stop him.

28:53.960 --> 28:55.720
Well, you certainly managed that.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.400
How's it going?

29:12.400 --> 29:15.800
Oh, I'm in my element rummaging
through the trash. You know me.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.240
Nothing much here, apart from
a criminally lax attitude

29:19.240 --> 29:20.280
to recycling.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.480
Adam's still here, is he?

29:24.480 --> 29:26.480
We wouldn't have got this far
without him.

29:26.480 --> 29:28.120
I want to trust him.

29:30.520 --> 29:31.640
What's that?

29:36.560 --> 29:37.600
Oh, my God.

29:39.080 --> 29:43.680
This was in that rubbish bag you
found at Simi Jacobs' place.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.800
It's Harry Fletcher's ECG,
taken the day of his operation.

29:46.800 --> 29:48.080
It's normal.

29:48.080 --> 29:51.920
And this is the ECG that
appeared in Fletcher's notes.

29:51.920 --> 29:55.000
Same date and time,
but grossly abnormal.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.800
We believe they were switched
to deflect blame from Rahul

29:58.800 --> 30:01.160
after the operation went wrong.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.120
So, there was a cover-up?

30:03.120 --> 30:05.840
Well, what's this got to do with
the murder investigation?

30:05.840 --> 30:08.800
Yeah, Simi Jacobs admitted to
the attack on Arnie Rahul.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.680
I mean, he claims it was an accident
as a result of self-defence.

30:11.680 --> 30:13.400
That fits with the
crime scene findings.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.760
So, how does this transplant fit in?

30:15.760 --> 30:18.520
Well, Simi was born with
sickle cell disease,

30:18.520 --> 30:22.680
and was treated with a bone marrow
transplant at St Jude's as a child.

30:22.680 --> 30:25.480
Wilfred donated his stem cells
for Simi's transplant.

30:25.480 --> 30:27.840
20 years later,
Wilfred gets leukaemia.

30:27.840 --> 30:29.720
We don't think
this is a coincidence.

30:29.720 --> 30:32.960
He had a type of leukaemia
that can be caused by over-exposure

30:32.960 --> 30:34.240
to certain drugs.

30:34.240 --> 30:37.640
There's a technique known as
mobilisation,

30:37.640 --> 30:40.520
which is designed to increase
production of stem cells.

30:40.520 --> 30:44.720
Normally, stem cell donation
involves giving a perfectly safe

30:44.720 --> 30:46.240
bone marrow stimulant.

30:46.240 --> 30:51.160
But whoever did this also gave
Wilfred high levels of chemotherapy,

30:51.160 --> 30:53.000
and did so repeatedly.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.360
They gave chemo? To a volunteer?

30:55.360 --> 30:57.520
To yield even more stem cells.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.760
What for? More transplants?

30:59.760 --> 31:04.680
Stem cells have the ability to
develop into any type of body cell.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.640
Brain, heart, blood -
you name it.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.960
So there's a huge range
of potential therapies

31:08.960 --> 31:12.520
in which they can be used,
one of which is transplantation.

31:12.520 --> 31:17.200
About ten years ago, Braithwaite
and her team identified stem cells

31:17.200 --> 31:19.400
that were very special indeed,

31:19.400 --> 31:22.960
capable of being turned into
what are called killer T-cells,

31:22.960 --> 31:27.040
part of the immune system, which can
be made to attack malignant tumours.

31:27.040 --> 31:29.400
The potential for this discovery
was enormous.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.720
These magic cells
all had the same gene,

31:31.720 --> 31:36.040
a gene we think might be common
in Wilfred's town.

31:36.040 --> 31:39.840
They went looking for transplant
donors to treat people like Simi,

31:39.840 --> 31:42.640
but what they discovered
was something much bigger,

31:42.640 --> 31:44.760
so they went back for more,
and more.

31:44.760 --> 31:47.400
Basically they were flogging him
for every last stem cell

31:47.400 --> 31:49.800
he could produce.
Him and all the others.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.120
Wilfred's town was basically
a stem cell farm.

31:52.120 --> 31:55.560
Can you prove Wilfred
was given the stimulating drugs?

31:55.560 --> 31:58.760
It may be possible,
but that's way out of my league.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.360
Sounds like we need
a second opinion.

32:22.360 --> 32:23.680
Thank you, Professor.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.320
Not at all.
It's very good to see you.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.840
Thank you.
Oh, he's away!

32:28.680 --> 32:32.120
Adam, hello again.
Hello. This is Dr Nikki Alexander.

32:32.120 --> 32:34.480
Hello. How do you do?
And you've already met DI Cracknell.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.080
Yes, of course. This way.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.720
That was Alfie.

32:38.720 --> 32:42.840
He's one of our early trial patients
- osteosarcoma.

32:42.840 --> 32:44.960
When he was referred to us,
he was in a hospice

32:44.960 --> 32:48.520
on palliative treatment,
expected to die within weeks.

32:48.520 --> 32:50.920
Please. That was two years ago.

32:52.320 --> 32:53.680
He's now disease-free.

32:56.440 --> 32:59.920
We wanted to show you some
bone marrow samples from Mr Okoye.

32:59.920 --> 33:02.160
He was moved from St Jude's
to be treated here.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.600
Hmm.

33:12.600 --> 33:14.240
Secondary leukaemia.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.600
They look very unusual.

33:18.600 --> 33:21.440
Mr Okoye was a stem cell donor.

33:21.440 --> 33:23.160
Was he?

33:23.160 --> 33:26.400
We were wondering
if it might be stimulated.

33:26.400 --> 33:27.760
You mean Cyclo-G?

33:29.080 --> 33:30.560
Oh, dear.

33:30.560 --> 33:34.120
Yes, it's possible.

33:34.120 --> 33:37.040
Is there any way we can confirm it?

33:37.040 --> 33:39.920
You would need to look into
the genetics of his blood cells.

33:39.920 --> 33:42.040
There are some telltale signs.

33:42.040 --> 33:45.400
We have several world experts
in cytogenetics here.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.640
They'd be happy to help.

33:47.640 --> 33:50.640
Your cancer therapies are based
on Braithwaite's stem cell research,

33:50.640 --> 33:54.760
are they not?
Yes. Yes. I've never denied it.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.440
Hers was an extraordinary
piece of work.

33:58.600 --> 34:01.680
She tried for years to turn it into
a practical treatment,

34:01.680 --> 34:06.280
but, in the end, she was stumped
by the obvious problem.

34:06.280 --> 34:08.160
The limited supply of donors.

34:08.160 --> 34:09.440
Precisely.

34:09.440 --> 34:13.840
So, what we brought to the party
is called gene editing.

34:15.080 --> 34:18.720
We found a way of inserting
the special gene

34:18.720 --> 34:21.120
into any old stem cell,
and the result is...

34:22.200 --> 34:23.680
Well, you met Alfie.

34:24.760 --> 34:27.240
What is your relationship
to Emily Braithwaite?

34:28.840 --> 34:30.360
Yes.

34:30.360 --> 34:33.520
Well, I suppose you'd say
we're rivals.

34:33.520 --> 34:37.400
She's never forgiven me
for succeeding where she failed.

34:37.400 --> 34:41.400
But I'm afraid her star
has been waning for some time.

34:41.400 --> 34:42.840
What makes you say that?

34:45.120 --> 34:47.120
She came to ask for my help.

34:47.120 --> 34:50.840
Believe me,
that alone suggests desperation.

34:50.840 --> 34:54.560
She had just lost a very large
research grant.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.120
Is it possible that Braithwaite
poisoned Mr Okoye

34:57.120 --> 35:00.480
and everyone else in his town
to get more stem cells?

35:00.480 --> 35:03.200
That's a serious accusation.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.040
Everything's falling apart.

35:05.040 --> 35:07.440
So, like a gambler,
she risks more and more,

35:07.440 --> 35:10.120
desperate for that big win
to get herself back on top.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.200
Now what?
Excuse me?

36:08.360 --> 36:11.600
You do realise my career is over?
And that's my fault?

36:11.600 --> 36:13.480
There's got to be a way out of this.

36:13.480 --> 36:14.800
You owe me that at least.

36:16.080 --> 36:18.720
You want Auntie Emily
to make it better?

36:20.240 --> 36:24.440
All those years I stuck up for you
with your father.

36:24.440 --> 36:27.360
You messed up. Again.

36:27.360 --> 36:29.120
For once in your life, own it.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.000
I don't get it.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.520
You and Rahul.

36:34.520 --> 36:36.720
You go to all these lengths
to protect his reputation,

36:36.720 --> 36:39.480
yet you show no interest
in who might have killed him.

36:39.480 --> 36:41.840
You don't even seem to even care
that he's dead!

36:43.240 --> 36:45.800
Maybe I've learnt to
bury my emotions.

36:47.640 --> 36:48.840
You should try it.

36:50.760 --> 36:52.840
You know they're onto you,

36:52.840 --> 36:55.560
and I'm not going to help you
this time.

36:55.560 --> 36:56.840
Oh, please.

36:58.440 --> 36:59.880
This is so painful.

37:06.640 --> 37:09.080
So, all roads lead to Braithwaite.

37:09.080 --> 37:11.400
Yes, but it's all circumstantial.

37:11.400 --> 37:14.080
There's nothing directly
connecting her to Wilfred.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.440
If you can find me something
concrete, I'll bring her in,

37:16.440 --> 37:18.360
but until then,
it's just speculation.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.760
Adam, where did you get to?

37:20.760 --> 37:23.320
Rahul's conduct during
Fletcher's operation amounted to

37:23.320 --> 37:25.280
criminal negligence.

37:25.280 --> 37:27.360
He could have been charged
for manslaughter.

37:27.360 --> 37:28.720
Well, he's dead.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.680
What if Braithwaite covered it up?

37:30.680 --> 37:33.080
That's attempting to pervert
the course of justice.

37:33.080 --> 37:34.600
Which means you can arrest her.

37:34.600 --> 37:37.680
Oh, and how do we know that
Braithwaite swaps the ECG?

37:37.680 --> 37:40.080
We can't. There are several
sets of prints on the trace,

37:40.080 --> 37:41.680
one of which could be Braithwaite's.

37:41.680 --> 37:44.120
Exactly, so we can't just arrest her
on the off-chance that

37:44.120 --> 37:45.560
her prints are on there.
I know.

37:45.560 --> 37:47.040
 I met her for a drink.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.760
Her prints are on this glass.

37:52.760 --> 37:56.000
When you find that they are
the same as the sets on the ECG,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.760
then you can arrest her.
That's not admissible as evidence!

37:58.760 --> 38:00.400
It doesn't have to be.

38:01.920 --> 38:05.320
How do we know for sure
she touched this glass?

38:05.320 --> 38:07.520
Well, you're just going to
have to trust me.

38:54.160 --> 38:55.640
You two go round the back.

39:07.280 --> 39:09.360
Her car's here.
Looks like she's home.

39:12.440 --> 39:13.480
No letterbox.

39:17.960 --> 39:19.320
Dr Braithwaite?

39:20.320 --> 39:22.680
DS Galloway.
Could you open the door, please?

39:27.040 --> 39:29.160
Police!
Dr Braithwaite?

39:41.280 --> 39:42.360
Shit.

39:48.640 --> 39:50.280
No sign of external injury.

39:52.120 --> 39:55.520
Both front and back doors
were locked from the inside.

39:55.520 --> 39:58.120
There's no signs
of forced entry.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.640
Everything's neat and tidy.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.160
Sudden chest pain, maybe?

40:04.680 --> 40:05.720
Or suicide.

40:38.160 --> 40:41.040
Nikki. Adam. Look at these.

40:46.560 --> 40:49.760
Two samples
with Wilfred Okoye's name on.

41:12.760 --> 41:14.720
Look at this.

41:14.720 --> 41:17.000
The boiler's locked out.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.920
Yeah. Mine does that all the time.

41:18.920 --> 41:20.160
Bloody things.

41:58.560 --> 42:01.120
Heart weighs 380g.

42:27.280 --> 42:30.120
Evidence of left ventricular
hypertrophy.

42:31.480 --> 42:32.960
Valves unremarkable.

42:36.280 --> 42:40.120
Left anterior descending
coronary artery.

42:40.120 --> 42:43.160
Moderate stenosis,
no evidence of thrombus.

42:51.560 --> 42:54.200
The toxicology
was entirely negative,

42:54.200 --> 42:56.760
apart from a modest level
of alcohol.

42:56.760 --> 43:00.720
No paracetamol,
no benzodiazepines, nothing.

43:00.720 --> 43:04.320
So this, together with the absence
of pills and containers

43:04.320 --> 43:07.280
at the address, and the absence
of any needle marks on the body,

43:07.280 --> 43:10.440
leads me to conclude that death
was not as a result

43:10.440 --> 43:13.000
of suicide or poisoning.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.480
In fact, the only significant
finding from the postmortem

43:16.480 --> 43:19.440
examination is moderate ischaemic
heart disease,

43:19.440 --> 43:22.880
together with hypertrophy of the
septum and left ventricular wall.

43:22.880 --> 43:25.840
But no evidence of
coronary thrombosis?

43:25.840 --> 43:28.800
The ventricular wall thickness...
Heart attack. ..and the degree

43:28.800 --> 43:32.600
of myocardial disarray on microscopy
are borderline

43:32.600 --> 43:34.640
for a diagnosis of HCM.

43:34.640 --> 43:37.560
What's that?
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

43:37.560 --> 43:40.920
It's an inherited heart condition
that can lead to sudden death.

43:40.920 --> 43:42.800
Fabrice Muamba.
Yes.

43:44.720 --> 43:48.440
Bolton Wanderers versus Tottenham.
FA Cup quarterfinal, 2012.

43:48.440 --> 43:50.400
He collapsed on the pitch.
Nearly died.

43:50.400 --> 43:52.280
Well, technically he did.

43:52.280 --> 43:54.320
In cases of high stress or exercise,

43:54.320 --> 43:58.440
the heart can lead into an abnormal
rhythm, which can be fatal.

43:58.440 --> 44:01.360
And Emily Braithwaite
was under a lot of stress.

44:01.360 --> 44:05.840
So it is possible that this caused
a dysrhythmic event...

44:05.840 --> 44:08.640
Heart attack. ..that led to
her death, don't you think?

44:12.640 --> 44:14.640
How come she didn't have
a letterbox?

44:14.640 --> 44:17.000
It's a passive house.
It's so well-insulated,

44:17.000 --> 44:19.680
it doesn't need heating.
You heat it up just by living in it.

44:19.680 --> 44:21.440
But it has to be really airtight.

44:21.440 --> 44:23.560
It's like living in a bubble.

44:23.560 --> 44:26.760
All the air goes in and out through
a single ventilation system.

44:28.400 --> 44:31.320
But why would the boiler lock out?

44:31.320 --> 44:35.760
What if it was faulty and produced
a lot of carbon monoxide?

44:35.760 --> 44:38.120
No carbon monoxide in
the toxicology.

44:42.400 --> 44:45.000
She's a suspect in a murder case.
She conveniently dies.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.840
What if others were involved?

44:46.840 --> 44:48.960
If you can tell me how they did it,
I'll believe you,

44:48.960 --> 44:52.480
but until then,
it's looking like natural causes.

44:52.480 --> 44:56.040
Right, then, provisional assumption
is that Braithwaite

44:56.040 --> 44:58.760
was guilty of conspiracy
to murder Wilfred Okoye,

44:58.760 --> 45:01.720
as well as perverting the course
of justice in the Fletcher case.

45:01.720 --> 45:02.920
What about Simi?

45:02.920 --> 45:06.960
That's up to the CPS, whether
they buy a self-defence plea.

45:06.960 --> 45:08.480
I'll keep you posted.

45:26.480 --> 45:28.760
So this is where you've been hiding.

45:30.960 --> 45:32.760
Adam told you, then?

45:32.760 --> 45:35.280
Oh, yeah. He told me everything.

46:31.680 --> 46:33.080
I don't get it.

46:33.080 --> 46:36.080
How could someone like Braithwaite
justify it to herself,

46:36.080 --> 46:37.400
let alone anyone else?

46:37.400 --> 46:39.920
They get fixated on the prize,
don't they?

46:39.920 --> 46:43.480
The breakthrough, and all
the acclaim that goes with it. Mm.

46:44.600 --> 46:47.800
Did you ever want to do something
like that? Fancy research job?

46:48.800 --> 46:50.640
I think you'd be really good
at that.

46:53.560 --> 46:54.600
I don't know.

46:55.720 --> 46:57.600
It's more Adam's world.
Mm.

46:58.760 --> 46:59.960
Not any more.

47:01.640 --> 47:04.400
You can see how liberated he's been.

47:04.400 --> 47:07.480
He's carried that secret around
for so long.

47:07.480 --> 47:11.040
Well, he's stopped trying to
be all things to all men.

47:11.040 --> 47:13.960
And I'll tell you,
he loves beating himself up.

48:13.400 --> 48:16.920
Hi. I'm working on the case
of Wilfred Okoye.

48:16.920 --> 48:19.200
I was wondering if I could get
his microbiology results

48:19.200 --> 48:20.640
from his stay here.

48:20.640 --> 48:23.120
Date of birth is 9/7/66.

48:28.440 --> 48:31.040
I just need to, er,
speak to my supervisor.

48:31.040 --> 48:32.280
OK. Thank you.

49:11.960 --> 49:13.520
It's Adam.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.320
"We were wrong about everything.

49:19.400 --> 49:22.040
"At Cowley Institute. Come quickly."
What?

49:25.440 --> 49:27.320
What are we looking at?

49:27.320 --> 49:30.160
Wilfred's blood cultures.
Microbiology report.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.240
Hang on.

49:35.560 --> 49:39.280
The antibiotic sensitivities
have been reversed.

49:39.280 --> 49:40.760
Who's done that? Braithwaite?

49:40.760 --> 49:43.320
Couldn't be. These are from
the Cowley institute.

49:45.960 --> 49:47.560
Adam needs us. Come on.

50:18.600 --> 50:21.440
Oh, great. We were supposed to
go left back at the lights.

50:38.800 --> 50:39.920
Dr Yuen?

50:39.920 --> 50:43.120
You know Emily Braithwaite
died yesterday?

50:43.120 --> 50:47.360
What? Uh, no. How did it happen?

50:47.360 --> 50:50.520
Unknown. Found dead in a house
that was bolted from the inside.

50:52.040 --> 50:54.600
Oh, look, an oxygen analyser.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.880
Do you always keep one of those
in your car?

50:57.880 --> 50:59.720
I use it for various things.

50:59.720 --> 51:03.000
So Emily died just as
you convinced us she was guilty.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.720
Her work was based on exploitation.

51:05.720 --> 51:07.920
Well, she can't deny that now,
can she?

51:07.920 --> 51:09.280
Well, whatever happened,

51:09.280 --> 51:12.560
I'm sure forensic science
will find the answer.

51:12.560 --> 51:16.040
Mm. Then I realised just how much
liquid nitrogen you go through here.

51:16.040 --> 51:18.040
Two deliveries in three days?

51:20.200 --> 51:23.600
I mean,
that is some evil genius stuff.

51:23.600 --> 51:25.760
Pretty quick and very clean.

51:25.760 --> 51:29.360
Except the pilot light in the boiler
went out at Braithwaite's house.

51:29.360 --> 51:30.760
Otherwise, the perfect crime.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.400
Are you insane?

51:33.400 --> 51:36.440
Oh, sorry. That's forensic science.
Get out.

51:40.720 --> 51:43.400
Braithwaite had Wilfred's
blood samples. She was onto you.

51:44.680 --> 51:46.480
My research is changing lives.

51:46.480 --> 51:48.200
She never made the crucial
breakthrough,

51:48.200 --> 51:49.760
but then again, neither did you.

51:49.760 --> 51:51.920
You reckon you'll crack it
any minute now, don't you?

51:51.920 --> 51:54.400
You just have to keep going,
keep blasting innocent men

51:54.400 --> 51:56.880
and women with poisonous drugs,
and then you'll get there.

51:56.880 --> 51:59.640
You know nothing. There's no
gene editing going on here.

51:59.640 --> 52:02.080
Your magic treatments are all
from stem cells that you get

52:02.080 --> 52:03.560
from killing people like Wilfred.

52:03.560 --> 52:07.240
When childhood cancer is
a thing of the past thanks to me,

52:07.240 --> 52:09.520
no-one will care.

52:09.520 --> 52:12.080
That's what it's all about,
isn't it?

52:12.080 --> 52:16.560
It's not about the money or
the power. It's about the prestige.

52:18.200 --> 52:20.800
So what are you going to do
about it, Adam?

52:20.800 --> 52:22.800
Mm? You're discredited.

52:22.800 --> 52:24.240
You're getting struck off.

52:25.480 --> 52:28.120
Of course I know!

52:28.120 --> 52:29.280
I know everything.

52:31.840 --> 52:34.240
You've no idea
who you're dealing with.

52:36.680 --> 52:37.920
Adam?

52:40.160 --> 52:41.200
Adam!

52:47.120 --> 52:49.640
Adam? What's happening?

52:49.640 --> 52:53.040
Cowley's the one exploiting Wilfred
and the rest of the donors.

52:53.040 --> 52:55.240
And he killed Braithwaite
with liquid nitrogen.

52:55.240 --> 52:57.360
He poured it in the vent
of her airtight house,

52:57.360 --> 53:00.840
turning it into a gas chamber.
She suffocated.

53:00.840 --> 53:03.840
Cowley did a deal with Rahul
to kill Wilfred during surgery.

53:03.840 --> 53:06.760
And when that failed, he attacked
Wilfred with the bacteria...

53:09.080 --> 53:11.320
..to make sure he switched
the micro reports

53:11.320 --> 53:13.320
so that the antibiotics
wouldn't work.

53:26.640 --> 53:27.840
Adam?

53:29.080 --> 53:30.400
Adam!

53:49.920 --> 53:53.720
I'm sure that's Cowley.
Really? Call Cracknell.

53:53.720 --> 53:55.920
But...
Get after him. I'll find Adam.

54:04.520 --> 54:08.520
Yeah, I'm heading north
on Colbridge Road.

54:08.520 --> 54:11.280
It's a black Mercedes.

54:11.280 --> 54:12.640
Adam?

54:12.640 --> 54:13.760
Adam!

54:13.760 --> 54:15.120
Oh, Jesus.

54:18.480 --> 54:20.000
Ambulance.

54:26.120 --> 54:28.360
Can you hear me? Adam?

54:28.360 --> 54:30.880
You took your time, mate.

54:30.880 --> 54:32.280
Come to take all the credit?

54:34.120 --> 54:35.400
Oh, man.

54:36.880 --> 54:39.600
The ambulance is on its way.
What happened?

54:39.600 --> 54:40.840
I messed up.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.120
You trusted me.

55:01.880 --> 55:02.960
That means a lot.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.480
Adam. Adam, stay with me.

55:07.480 --> 55:09.800
Adam. Come on, man. Stay with me.
Stay with me.

55:09.800 --> 55:11.080
Come on! Adam!

55:12.360 --> 55:13.400
Adam!

56:00.480 --> 56:01.520
Oh, God.

56:08.600 --> 56:10.000
Oh, no.

56:42.120 --> 56:48.480
# Testator silens

56:51.320 --> 56:58.120
# Costestes e spiritu

56:58.120 --> 57:04.600
# Silencium. #
