00:01.168 --> 00:02.761
<i>Previously on Hit the Floor.</i>

00:02.920 --> 00:05.890
Oh, my God. The guy who isn't
good enough for me to know existed

00:06.048 --> 00:07.766
is good enough
for you to have sex with?

00:07.925 --> 00:10.428
- How was she?
- This fling is over.

00:10.594 --> 00:12.062
- I have to beat her.
- What are you saying, Ahsha?

00:12.221 --> 00:14.189
Tell whoever you have to tell.

00:14.348 --> 00:17.272
Coach Davenport, what can you
tell us about Ahsha Hayes?

00:17.434 --> 00:19.732
When did you find out
she was your daughter?

00:19.895 --> 00:22.239
- I'm out. You win.
- Where will you go?

00:22.397 --> 00:25.025
I can't get my life back here
but I can have one somewhere else.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.115
What the hell?

00:27.277 --> 00:29.029
- You're not getting this back.
-It's in the Cloud now.

00:29.196 --> 00:32.200
You cannot even imagine the ways
you're gonna regret this, Raquel.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.289
- We heard rumours.
- What rumours?

00:34.451 --> 00:36.419
That you're an exotic dancer.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.127
Oh, God, no. I'm a stripper.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.007
I actually know
quite a lot about you.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.464
And what was that guy's name?
Benny Wise? That was a mess.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.883
- You blew it.
- Ms Hart.

00:47.798 --> 00:50.221
Deal's a deal.
Terrence Wall stays a Devil

00:50.342 --> 00:53.596
and you get the one thing
you want more than anything.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.101
You're breaking up with me?
- I see where this is going

00:59.226 --> 01:01.228
-even if you don't.
- You said you would fight.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.863
- Where's Ahsha?
- Pete?

01:02.980 --> 01:05.654
A Devil Girl was found floating
under the Vincent Thomas Bridge.

02:18.930 --> 02:23.777
<i>It is with great sadness that
I'm standing before you today.</i>

02:23.935 --> 02:30.238
The Devils organisation is heartbroken
over the loss of one of its own.

02:30.400 --> 02:36.498
A shining star filled with
so much promise gone too soon.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.993
Mia Sertner.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.039
<i>When Mia came to us full of life,</i>

02:43.205 --> 02:46.334
<i>we had no idea the trouble
she carried deep inside.</i>

02:46.500 --> 02:49.504
Trouble she knew
no other way out of

02:49.670 --> 02:52.719
than to step off
the Vincent Thomas Bridge.

02:52.881 --> 02:58.433
They... They pulled her from the water

02:59.471 --> 03:03.977
at 10:16 pm last night.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.944
It is a crushing loss

03:06.061 --> 03:10.191
and our hearts go out
to all those affected by her passing.

03:10.357 --> 03:13.156
- Miss Vincent. Miss Vincent.
- No, no.

03:20.701 --> 03:25.207
I shouldn't have had to do that.
That was PR's job.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.380
As director of the Devil Girls,
it was your responsibility.

03:29.501 --> 03:32.345
My job isn't to paint pictures of
my girls as depressed or overwhelmed.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.931
We have no idea what she was thinking
or what was going on in her head.

03:35.090 --> 03:38.890
- We did what we had to do.
- We?

03:39.052 --> 03:41.646
- I'm not stupid.
- This is the job you signed up for.

03:42.180 --> 03:45.104
Is it?
Or am I just covering your ass?

03:50.689 --> 03:52.532
Where is she?

03:53.650 --> 03:56.199
Look. Kyle came to cheer you up!

03:56.361 --> 03:58.284
You look like hell.

03:59.865 --> 04:03.460
Sweetheart, there's a game today
and they're announcing the All-Star

04:03.618 --> 04:05.620
and you're only 1000 votes
behind Jelena.

04:05.746 --> 04:09.216
Hell, when I heard your daddy
was Grumpy McScruff, even I voted.

04:10.876 --> 04:15.006
German broke up with me
after three and a half years.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.891
I'm never getting out of this bed
ever again.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.237
I told you
not to make me worry about you.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.898
These are the things that happen.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.776
Now, you're not getting fired,
so go get in the shower, get dressed

04:35.901 --> 04:38.745
and have your ass in my car
in ten minutes.

04:47.078 --> 04:49.456
I know you've been as worried sick
about Ahsha as I've been,

04:49.581 --> 04:51.208
but I heard through
the Devils grapevine

04:51.374 --> 04:54.218
that she spent the night last night
at Raquel's.

04:55.962 --> 04:59.011
What Mia's mother
must be going through.

04:59.174 --> 05:02.269
That poor girl.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.104
We haven't talked about Ahsha.

05:09.100 --> 05:13.901
It's all out in the open now.
I'm her dad. We have a child together.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.823
That doesn't change anything
between you and me.

05:19.986 --> 05:23.035
We're as over today
as we were yesterday.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.701
I don't understand.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.336
We were so lucky
to find each other again.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.089
How can you just
slam the door on that?

05:31.248 --> 05:34.377
After everything that
we have been through together.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.845
After these last few weeks.

05:40.757 --> 05:44.887
You want to know why I've avoided
all your talk about feelings

05:45.053 --> 05:47.101
this whole time
we've been sleeping together,

05:47.222 --> 05:50.567
why I change the subject
whenever you bring it up?

05:50.725 --> 05:52.568
Yeah.

05:52.727 --> 05:57.574
Because if I allowed myself to feel,

05:57.732 --> 06:00.076
really feel, what I felt for you...

06:02.195 --> 06:04.744
I would dissolve
into a million pieces

06:04.906 --> 06:07.500
and I would never be able
to be put back together again.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.419
You broke my heart!

06:13.540 --> 06:18.137
You cut me deeper
than anyone has my whole life.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.757
And if I tried to touch that pain...

06:24.593 --> 06:26.220
I wouldn't survive.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.860
That's how I know
we can never be together.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.323
Hello.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.614
Devils Nation!

07:22.776 --> 07:25.154
It's time to announce which dancer

07:25.320 --> 07:29.200
will be representing the Devils
at the All-Star Game.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.289
Are you ready?

07:39.501 --> 07:44.382
And the winner
of the All-Star vote is...

07:48.927 --> 07:52.101
Ahsha Hayes!

07:58.144 --> 08:00.647
See you at the All-Star Game,
Ahsha.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.943
- All right, Ahsha!
- Congratulations!

08:05.318 --> 08:07.946
You had a good run, Jelena.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.998
Another win for the Devils.
Good night, Devils Nation.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.585
Surreal. I'm overwhelmed.

08:17.747 --> 08:21.797
- Thank you guys for coming.
- Great. Appreciate it.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.840
Congrats. You won.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.844
Let me guess.
Don't enjoy it for too long?

08:30.010 --> 08:33.890
No, I was going to say
I'm impressed.

08:34.972 --> 08:38.568
You saw what you had to do to get
what you wanted and you did it.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.778
I saw you coming.

08:43.940 --> 08:48.320
When you first showed up at that first
audition with your big saucer eyes

08:48.486 --> 08:51.911
and your I have a dream speech,

08:52.073 --> 08:55.543
you were sweet, giggly.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.628
I couldn't compete with that.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.583
You were going to be trouble.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.753
Why are you telling me this now?

09:04.919 --> 09:10.801
Because you're not
that girl anymore.

09:10.967 --> 09:14.346
This Ahsha got her hands dirty.

09:14.512 --> 09:17.106
And no matter
how good you try to be,

09:17.223 --> 09:21.069
no matter how good
you want to pretend you still are,

09:21.186 --> 09:23.188
you can't wash that dirt off.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.650
This Ahsha I can compete with.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.409
This is where it gets fun.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.625
Great for Ahsha. Better for me.

09:44.167 --> 09:47.262
Jelena needed to be knocked down
a peg, that's for sure.

09:52.884 --> 09:57.014
- Something else is on your mind.
- Mia.

09:58.807 --> 10:02.402
Oscar's micromanaging every move
I make when it comes to that girl,

10:02.560 --> 10:03.982
what I say, how I say it.

10:04.104 --> 10:07.278
Mark my words, he's got
some vested interest in her.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.994
What kind of interest?

10:11.152 --> 10:14.873
Mia was involved in something.

10:15.031 --> 10:20.208
And from the way he's acting,
it's setting off my alarm.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.550
You're being paranoid. I mean,
he's like that with everything.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.633
I really wouldn't worry about it.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.229
What are you doing here?

10:42.392 --> 10:45.111
Well, you're not answering
any of my calls.

10:46.104 --> 10:49.074
I have something important
I need to tell you.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.446
Whatever I was doing with Pete,
it's over.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.284
I don't believe
anything you say anymore.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.293
I wish I was just trying to be mean,
but it's the truth.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.204
You keep saying one thing
and doing another.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.715
You can't even trust yourself.

11:07.041 --> 11:12.423
Well, from what I've heard, we've
both done things out of character.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.967
I heard what happened with German.

11:15.133 --> 11:19.183
Ahsha, don't push away the two people
who love you the most.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.773
If this is what was so important
that you needed to drive

11:21.931 --> 11:24.810
all the way down here to tell me,
you wasted your time.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.021
It's not what I came to tell you.

11:29.480 --> 11:33.405
- I came to tell you something else.
- Then you really wasted a trip.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.037
I'm just trying to make a dollar
out of 15 cents.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.578
Where are you going?

11:42.702 --> 11:46.457
I have publicity stuff
for the All-Star Game.

11:46.581 --> 11:49.755
So you just weren't going to say
anything about my losing?

11:49.918 --> 11:51.966
You don't look too crushed to me.

11:52.128 --> 11:56.258
If I didn't know you any better I'd say
you had something else going on.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.602
- Something better.
- You always think I'm scheming.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.689
Aren't you?

12:02.847 --> 12:05.475
Well, at least you always know
what you get with me.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.196
Something else is going on
with you too.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.865
I'm just considering something.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.204
Something bad or something good?

12:19.781 --> 12:22.955
Just something.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.961
Feel like celebrating
an All-Star win?

12:33.127 --> 12:35.255
Can't. I have to do something
that just won't wait.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.929
- Another girl in need of an ice bath?
- Ahsha.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.178
Rain check.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.147
Hail the conquering hero.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.018
You gonna go raise a glass
with your big baller?

12:48.142 --> 12:52.113
I don't have one.
German broke up with me.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.280
I'm sorry. Maybe not that
you and him aren't together,

12:56.442 --> 12:59.571
but you got no one to celebrate with.
Why don't you let me take you out?

12:59.737 --> 13:02.536
I don't have the energy
to fight you off all night.

13:02.699 --> 13:06.545
I told you I took it back. And in case
you forgot, you're the coach's daughter,

13:06.661 --> 13:09.585
so big time hands off.
No touchy-touchy.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.510
Believe what you want,
but the last thing I'm trying to do is

13:14.669 --> 13:16.342
ruffle anyone's feathers these days.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.260
I appreciate the offer.

13:18.381 --> 13:21.134
And it'd be nice to at least pretend
I pulled off something epic,

13:21.301 --> 13:22.974
but I'm just gonna head out.

13:23.136 --> 13:28.142
I'm feeling pretty tragic.
Perfect for drinking alone. Night.

13:39.068 --> 13:42.242
Olivia's suspicious.
Can't afford her digging.

13:42.405 --> 13:47.252
I have Olivia under control. She won't
be a problem for much longer.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.754
What? Like Mia was a problem?

13:49.912 --> 13:51.835
That's my wife you're talking about.

13:54.792 --> 13:58.217
Are you implying that I had
something to do with Mia's death?

13:58.379 --> 14:01.007
Because I could
just as easily suspect you.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.926
Mia knew a lot of things
that could have blown

14:03.092 --> 14:05.060
your big $2 billion development deal.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.563
Mia never would have been a problem
in the first place

14:07.722 --> 14:09.895
if you had kept your hands
to yourself.

14:10.058 --> 14:12.026
That night
was a misunderstanding.

14:13.227 --> 14:16.822
When Mia came to me
saying she'd been raped,

14:16.939 --> 14:19.567
she seemed pretty clear.

14:24.155 --> 14:26.704
Her death was ruled a suicide.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.040
It's all water under the bridge now.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.252
Let's be happy it all worked out
so cleanly.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.552
You're glowing.

15:27.718 --> 15:31.063
Does this have anything to do
with Jesse killing my subpoena?

15:31.180 --> 15:33.899
He is out of my hair forever.

15:34.058 --> 15:37.358
- Hit man?
- Close.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.613
- What's wrong?
- What's right?

15:42.775 --> 15:45.699
First I fool myself
into believing that...

15:46.779 --> 15:49.123
- What?
- No.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.831
I'm always sitting here
complaining to you.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.542
It's exhausting, I'm exhausted.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.539
Are you exhausted?

15:57.748 --> 16:00.592
I've never seen you
outside of this arena.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.970
What do you look like
in the real world?

16:03.129 --> 16:05.348
Do you exist in the real world?

16:07.133 --> 16:10.683
Pete Davenport,
are you asking me out on a date?

16:11.679 --> 16:14.478
Yes. Yes, I am.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.906
Still want to celebrate with me?

16:34.577 --> 16:36.579
- I saw them together.
- When?

16:36.704 --> 16:39.378
- Tonight.
- You broke up. How's that cheating?

16:39.540 --> 16:42.669
I didn't say it was cheating.
I said it was gross.

16:42.835 --> 16:46.305
We just broke up and he's already
with some other girl.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.345
It's not gross, it's disgusting.

16:48.508 --> 16:52.433
You know what?
Tonight's about you, not him.

16:52.595 --> 16:55.815
Come on. We're getting out of here.

16:55.973 --> 16:59.068
- I want to show you something.
- I know what you want to show me.

16:59.227 --> 17:03.778
Will you stop? I'm serious.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.193
I want to show you
something beautiful.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.463
Shut up.

18:05.960 --> 18:09.885
I'm gonna need CPR
'cause I am gagging on irony.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.424
Lexi's a stripper!

18:11.591 --> 18:14.640
I'm an exotic dancer and it's Candy.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.847
Hey, could I get a picture?

18:18.014 --> 18:20.938
The pay is great
and I never have to pop my top.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.900
That just tells me no one's asked.
I want a lap dance.

18:27.148 --> 18:30.618
Kidding. I'm looking for the guy
who gave me this.

18:30.776 --> 18:34.872
I recognise the serial killer
handwriting, it's from Benny.

18:35.031 --> 18:38.956
- Benny's not here.
- But he was.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.918
He just got out and he's already
been back. Okay, two things, darling.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.128
One, I don't wait for things to happen,
I make them happen.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.795
- So you tell Benny I'm coming for him.
- What's the second thing?

18:48.961 --> 18:51.305
Oh, when you drop it low, Candy,

18:51.422 --> 18:54.847
you need to clean the floor
with that ass. It's big enough.

18:55.009 --> 18:57.103
<i>Mop, MOD-</i>

19:06.187 --> 19:09.862
So, where should we go?

19:37.760 --> 19:40.138
I love it up here.

19:40.262 --> 19:43.266
I feel like I'm on top of the world.

19:54.110 --> 19:57.956
Okay. Dude, you haven't
even tried a move on me yet.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.958
Not even a hand graze. Why not?

20:01.951 --> 20:04.625
You know why not.

20:04.745 --> 20:09.842
Besides, there's way more fun
to be had. Watch this.

20:15.381 --> 20:19.261
Don't hear anything.
It just keeps falling and falling.

20:19.427 --> 20:21.054
Let me try.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.447
That was fun. This night was fun.

20:35.609 --> 20:39.204
I think I kind of needed it.
Thank you.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.870
My pleasure.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.546
I'm the coach's daughter.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.803
I won't tell him if you don't.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.660
You're like a little Madeline.

22:07.785 --> 22:10.379
What grown man lives in a hotel.

22:10.538 --> 22:14.133
I think you mean Eloise,
and are you judging me?

22:14.291 --> 22:16.635
Now I am.

22:16.794 --> 22:18.888
I'm going through
a transition period.

22:19.880 --> 22:23.054
- You're in a midlife crisis.
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:23.217 --> 22:27.393
Well, you have a daughter
you didn't know you had,

22:27.555 --> 22:29.273
a wife you wish you didn't

22:29.431 --> 22:32.230
and your home comes
with a free continental breakfast.

22:32.393 --> 22:36.443
I'm not arguing with the crisis,
it's the mid-life I take issue with.

22:36.605 --> 22:42.157
Fair enough.
You're a young, studly disaster.

22:42.319 --> 22:45.448
From crisis to disaster.
You better run.

22:45.614 --> 22:49.664
Are you kidding? I love disasters.
Can't resist them.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.398
It really is the best
continental breakfast in the city.

23:13.017 --> 23:15.190
I should go.

23:19.273 --> 23:23.779
But this was an amazing night.

23:23.903 --> 23:28.033
Well, maybe I'll get to see you
outside the arena again.

23:28.198 --> 23:30.417
Yeah. That would be nice.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.346
Yes?

23:42.463 --> 23:45.057
I tried to make this work,
but I couldn't.

23:45.215 --> 23:48.560
- What is "this"?
- You and me.

23:52.640 --> 23:56.816
It was always going to be a struggle,
from the very beginning.

23:56.977 --> 23:59.605
We're too much alike.
Someone had to go.

24:02.816 --> 24:05.740
You don't have to go, Jelena.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.080
You just have to learn
to stand down once in a while.

24:08.238 --> 24:11.287
Not be a bitch 50% of the time.

24:12.952 --> 24:17.458
Thanks for the tip,
but I'm not leaving.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.377
You are.

24:33.097 --> 24:38.900
This isn't right. This says
you own 10% of the Devil Girls.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.646
Oh, good, we can both read.

24:44.191 --> 24:47.661
When people see you now, Olivia,
they see a dead Devil Girl

24:47.820 --> 24:49.788
and the organisation
can't have that.

24:49.947 --> 24:54.669
As part owner I have the obligation
to do what's best for business.

24:54.827 --> 24:58.297
Unfortunately that means
letting you go.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.833
- Letting me--
- You're fired.

25:05.212 --> 25:07.340
You are deranged.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.684
News flash, I own 10% as well,

25:10.843 --> 25:14.518
so even if this wasn't drawn up
at a joke shop, you couldn't fire me.

25:16.890 --> 25:22.943
News flash. With Oscar's 41%,
majority stakes rules.

25:24.398 --> 25:27.868
- Oscar?
- And it's sinking in.

25:34.116 --> 25:36.084
You had a good run, Olivia.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.343
Where's the fire?

25:49.465 --> 25:51.467
In Oscar's office
in about 15 seconds.

25:51.633 --> 25:53.431
I am burning
this whole damn place down.

25:53.594 --> 25:55.221
What's going on?

25:55.345 --> 25:57.188
Oscar gave Jelena the gun
she needed to take me out with.

25:57.347 --> 26:00.476
Apparently I am bad for business.

26:00.642 --> 26:03.486
- These are legit.
- Of course it is.

26:04.980 --> 26:08.075
I knew he was making me the face
of Mia's death for a reason.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.235
He set me up for this, Chase.

26:10.402 --> 26:14.202
Who does Oscar think
could possibly do my job?

26:14.364 --> 26:17.538
With Olivia Vincent stepping down
due to recent events,

26:17.659 --> 26:20.037
the Devils Girls
needed someone truly great

26:20.204 --> 26:22.423
who knew their values and ideals

26:22.539 --> 26:25.713
and would maintain the legacy
of this fine group of women.

26:25.876 --> 26:32.350
Ladies and gentlemen, I am so happy
to introduce to you our new director.

26:32.466 --> 26:35.345
Original Devil Girl, Sloane Hayes.

26:40.224 --> 26:45.071
Sloane is the proud mother of
freshly-minted All-Star Ahsha Hayes.

26:45.229 --> 26:48.483
Ahsha's father, of course, is
our very own Pete Davenport.

26:48.649 --> 26:50.993
We've experienced loss this week,

26:51.151 --> 26:55.122
but the Devils have come out of it
even stronger.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.454
We've come out a family.

27:01.787 --> 27:08.636
I am overwhelmed to be a part
of this organisation again.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.217
It feels good to be home.

27:23.433 --> 27:25.811
- German.
<i>- I'll</i> see you inside.

27:27.980 --> 27:31.735
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry to show up at your job.

27:32.860 --> 27:36.865
- Why did you?
- You came by our place.

27:37.906 --> 27:40.910
My place. You drove away.

27:41.076 --> 27:43.750
You saw something, all right?
But you got it all wrong.

27:43.912 --> 27:46.290
There was a girl there,
but it's nothing.

27:46.456 --> 27:49.005
She's just somebody
that I work with, that's all.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.091
Look, I don't know why, all right,

27:51.253 --> 27:54.553
but it was just important to me
for you to know that.

27:55.966 --> 27:59.561
Ahsha, I would never hook with
somebody the day after we broke up.

28:00.804 --> 28:02.602
I'm not that kind of person.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.190
What did you come by to tell me?

28:09.104 --> 28:13.154
I came to...
I just wanted to celebrate.

28:14.568 --> 28:18.368
I have to go get ready for the game.
I have to go. Thanks for coming.

28:41.386 --> 28:46.734
22 years of running away
and you wind up here.

28:48.435 --> 28:53.282
I am struggling with what makes you
qualified to do this job.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.368
It'll be on-the-job training.

28:56.526 --> 28:57.903
You may have been
the better dancer,

28:58.070 --> 29:01.495
but you have no idea
how dirty this business is.

29:04.660 --> 29:08.290
- Oscar's using you.
- I came to him.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.179
Why would you want this job?

29:17.214 --> 29:20.844
After everything that's happened,
after everything you've been through.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.977
Ahsha.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.189
You should be careful, Sloane.

29:29.351 --> 29:33.151
There are some things
even you can't control.

29:46.994 --> 29:51.044
- You always look that good?
- Yeah.

29:51.206 --> 29:53.880
No ankle bracelet, Benny.
So you're out-out?

29:54.042 --> 29:57.512
I'm out-out.
Thanks to the money you kicked in.

29:57.671 --> 29:59.673
Although it wasn't the full amount.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.218
But I managed to scrape
together the rest.

30:02.342 --> 30:06.222
- I wanted to surprise you.
- Nothing you do surprises me.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.120
You ain't seen nothing yet.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.377
Who was that?

30:28.535 --> 30:30.128
My husband.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.135
Ahsha.

30:40.213 --> 30:44.844
I'm sorry. This is what I was trying
to tell you yesterday.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.312
What are you talking about?

30:49.681 --> 30:52.230
Olivia's leaving.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.440
And I agreed to take her job.

30:56.021 --> 30:59.116
I'm the new director
of the Devil Girls.

31:01.401 --> 31:04.450
Ahsha, talk to me,
I'm your mother.

31:04.613 --> 31:08.083
You're not my mother,
you're my boss and I have a game.

31:16.249 --> 31:18.593
Welcome back.

31:27.511 --> 31:29.934
Terrence, what are you doing in here?

31:31.598 --> 31:34.272
I thought long and hard

31:34.434 --> 31:39.235
and I realised that I can't change
the way I feel.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.041
Baby.

31:54.663 --> 31:56.631
Baby.

32:10.595 --> 32:14.395
- Terrence.
- I always knew what you could do.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.439
I just never thought
you could do it to me.

32:20.605 --> 32:23.779
No. No, no, no. Baby, I was scared
and you were leaving

32:23.900 --> 32:27.370
-and you weren't telling me anything.
- I don't want to hear it.

32:29.531 --> 32:32.410
Other players have girls
they screw in every city.

32:35.245 --> 32:37.247
You were it for me.

32:39.166 --> 32:40.759
You were it.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.880
I loved you.

32:47.215 --> 32:48.933
We could have had everything.

32:50.969 --> 32:54.018
I wanted you to be
the mother of my kids.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.401
But you couldn't trust it.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.109
And you destroyed it.

33:09.362 --> 33:15.165
And even while I'm telling you this,
I'm the one with the wet eyes.

33:22.918 --> 33:25.216
Have a good life, Jelena.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.756
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to Los Angeles.</i>

34:04.918 --> 34:06.920
<i>Coming up next, a performance</i>

34:07.087 --> 34:10.261
<i>from your very own
Los Angeles Devil Girls.</i>

37:23.491 --> 37:27.667
Thanks to our careful planning
and smart investing...

37:32.083 --> 37:35.678
we're gonna be breaking ground
in Hollywood a week from today,

37:35.837 --> 37:38.215
right after the All-Star Game.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.260
Cheers.

37:58.735 --> 38:00.988
Someone told me where you lived.

38:02.864 --> 38:06.334
- Sorry if I'm interrupting something.
- What...

38:08.787 --> 38:10.164
What are you doing here?

38:24.177 --> 38:26.521
Are you ready for this job?

38:27.514 --> 38:32.361
No. I'm not ready,
but I also can't sit by

38:32.519 --> 38:38.117
and watch another girl ground up
by that organisation, by that man.

38:38.274 --> 38:41.744
The league's been doing an enquiry
on Oscar Kincade for a while,

38:41.861 --> 38:44.114
but we never had a way in.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.658
When you came to us...

38:46.783 --> 38:50.333
Well, we're grateful for your help.

38:53.206 --> 38:55.208
Mia told me things.

38:56.626 --> 39:00.881
Oscar may think whatever she knew
died with her,

39:01.047 --> 39:03.391
but I'm gonna make sure it didn't.

39:05.009 --> 39:08.604
None of those girls are safe,
including my daughter,

39:08.763 --> 39:10.515
as long he's inside.

39:10.682 --> 39:14.562
That man is a cancer...

39:17.647 --> 39:19.649
and I need to cut him out.
