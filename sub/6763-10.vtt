Look, Brandon is perfectly aware
he's working on a deadline,

02:09.300 --> 02:11.000
what do you say
we just leave him alone, okay?

02:11.300 --> 02:13.100
l don't get how we're supposed
to lay out the paper

02:13.400 --> 02:14.500
without Brandon's editorial.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.300
Craig, it's gonna be fine.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.600
if l have to lay out
the paper myself, l will.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.300
- Thank you.
- Whatever you say.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.600
<i>lt was just another Friday night</i>
<i>in America</i>

02:38.900 --> 02:40.600
<i>and l don't think any of us</i>
<i>stopped to think</i>

02:40.800 --> 02:42.900
<i>that from Pompano</i> B <i>each</i>
<i>to Saint Paul,</i>

02:43.100 --> 02:46.200
<i>kids all over the country were doing</i>
<i>the exact same thing we were,</i>

02:48.100 --> 02:50.100
<i>l mean, how much more typically</i>
<i>American</i>

02:50.400 --> 02:52.300
<i>can you get than a football game,</i>

02:52.600 --> 02:55.500
<i>a high school dance</i>
<i>and a burger joint?</i>

02:57.100 --> 02:58.600
<i>What was atypical was</i>

02:58.800 --> 03:01.900
<i>that for only the third time</i>
<i>since a man walked on the moon</i>

03:02.200 --> 03:05.500
<i>West</i> B <i>everly was undefeated</i>
<i>after three games,</i>

03:05.900 --> 03:10.200
<i>And what was even more unexpected</i>
<i>was that my sister,</i> B <i>renda Walsh,</i>

03:10.600 --> 03:13.000
<i>had volunteered to become</i>
<i>the head of the dance committee,</i>

03:13.300 --> 03:16.100
Bren, why do you want to be in charge
of the Pigskin Prom, of all things?

03:16.400 --> 03:17.800
- Why do you think?
- l don't know,

03:18.000 --> 03:19.400
maybe you wanna date a jock.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.000
What can l say, Dylan?
l'm madly in lust with Tony Miller.

03:26.700 --> 03:29.800
And then again, maybe it's the fact that
all the money raised at the dance

03:30.100 --> 03:32.700
goes to the Alvarado Street Elementary
School for their Christmas drive.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.300
Maybe that has something
to do with it.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.600
l didn't know you were so civic-minded,
Bren.

03:36.900 --> 03:39.300
- And you're going to the dance with me.
- No.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.600
<i>Some of the major social issues</i>
<i>confronting this generation</i>

03:42.900 --> 03:46.000
<i>were also the subject</i>
<i>of fierce debate that night,</i>

03:46.500 --> 03:49.600
- She's definitely coming onto him.
- No, she's not.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.400
- What do you call that?
- Donna, she's a freshman.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.500
David's always been like
an older brother to her.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.600
He and Scott were best friends,
you know that, okay?

04:02.700 --> 04:05.300
She is definitely coming onto him.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.400
B <i>ut the focus was definitely football,</i>

04:07.900 --> 04:09.900
<i>Specifically next week's game,</i>

04:10.200 --> 04:13.300
<i>which everyone knew would be the</i>
<i>toughest one we'd have all season,</i>

04:13.700 --> 04:16.200
You're the sports editor, you have
an obligation to make a prediction.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.800
Yeah. Who's gonna win?
Shaw or us?

04:19.300 --> 04:20.300
All right.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.700
l predict that a mighty team will fall.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.700
Don't go out on a limb here
or anything.

04:25.900 --> 04:27.900
Hey, hey, come on guys,
it's a tough call.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.000
These guys are good,
what do they call themselves?

04:30.300 --> 04:31.800
The Masters of the Universe?

04:32.100 --> 04:33.800
Should be Armed and Dangerous.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.500
Yeah, if we survive
the ride down there,

04:36.700 --> 04:37.900
the game will be a piece of cake.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.900
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
l've got the scores here.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.800
- Hamilton smashes Jefferson 21 -6.
- Yes.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.300
Quincy and <i>V</i> an Buren tie,
1 3 apiece.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.200
- What about Shaw?
- Shaw?

04:49.500 --> 04:51.000
Come on, just the score, Sanders.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.500
Shaw 49, Wilshire zip.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.400
Like you said, piece of cake.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.700
The guy said something happened

05:02.900 --> 05:04.400
in the closing seconds
of the Shaw game.

05:04.700 --> 05:05.800
Some violence or something.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.000
Well, it's a violent game, Sanders.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.800
l think it was pretty major.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.100
<i>Maybe if we hadn't been</i>
<i>on a winning streak,</i>

05:12.400 --> 05:14.300
<i>l would have jumped on the story,</i>

05:14.600 --> 05:17.600
B <i>ut it wasn't until breakfast</i>
<i>the next morning that it registered,</i>

05:17.900 --> 05:20.100
<i>Something major</i>
<i>had indeed occurred,</i>

05:20.400 --> 05:22.200
l thought they were supposed
to increase the peace.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.500
What's wrong?

05:23.700 --> 05:24.800
The gangs are at it again.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.400
l hate hearing about that stuff.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.600
Two spectators were shot to death

05:28.900 --> 05:31.300
in the stands at a high school
football game last night.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.700
Where?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.300
You ever heard of
Shaw High School?

05:34.900 --> 05:37.300
Yeah, l've heard of them. That's
the team we're playing next week.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.200
- At their school?
- Yeah.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.400
l wouldn't count on it.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.000
<i>When l got to the team meeting,</i>

05:46.300 --> 05:49.200
<i>everybody was talking about</i>
<i>the incident at Shaw,</i>

05:49.500 --> 05:51.600
The guy on the radio said
it was panic city.

05:51.900 --> 05:53.000
l heard it wasn't anything.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.200
Two guys shot dead
is definitely something, Tony.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.000
Oh, hey, there's no way
l'm gonna play down there, man.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.000
What are you worried about?

06:00.300 --> 06:01.500
What's that supposed to mean?

06:01.800 --> 06:04.300
lt means that l have a little bit more
to worry about than you do.

06:04.600 --> 06:07.100
Hey, look, it's not about
the colour of your skin, bro.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.800
lt's about where you live
and how you talk

06:10.100 --> 06:11.600
and what kind of car you drive.

06:12.700 --> 06:13.800
All right, everybody, listen up.

06:14.700 --> 06:17.600
Now, you've probably heard rumours
about the violence at Shaw.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.800
<i>When Coach Chapman told us</i>
<i>the practise had been called off</i>

06:21.100 --> 06:23.400
<i>so he could attend an emergency</i>
<i>meeting of the school board,</i>

06:23.700 --> 06:26.400
<i>it became clear to all of us</i>
<i>that the only thing normal</i>

06:26.600 --> 06:28.800
<i>that would be happening</i>
<i>at West</i> B <i>everly that day</i>

06:29.100 --> 06:31.700
<i>would be</i> B <i>renda's band auditions</i>
<i>for the dance,</i>

06:48.400 --> 06:49.500
Where's Kelly?

06:49.800 --> 06:52.400
lf you'd just hired David
we wouldn't have to go through this.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.800
This is so cool.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.100
You better get this gig, Silver.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.400
Okay, come on, everybody.
Let's get started.

07:02.400 --> 07:03.700
Hey, you with the guitar.

07:07.800 --> 07:11.400
Okay, welcome to
the Pigskin Prom auditions.

07:11.700 --> 07:13.700
First up will be...

07:15.400 --> 07:16.400
...Grudgemaster?

07:19.800 --> 07:22.000
Just hire David.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.200
- Hello, hello.
- Hi.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.200
That smile can only mean one thing.
Big date last night?

07:28.800 --> 07:30.100
Big phone call this morning.

07:30.300 --> 07:31.300
l talked to my father.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.600
He called from Barcelona

07:32.800 --> 07:35.000
and it was definitely the best
conversation we have ever had.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.800
- Kelly--?
- l know what you're thinking, Don,

07:38.100 --> 07:39.900
and l told him straight out, l said:

07:40.200 --> 07:43.000
''l don't even want to talk to you,
if you're just going to shine me again.''

07:43.300 --> 07:47.300
But then he apologised about last year
and explained what happened

07:47.700 --> 07:49.100
and by the end we were both crying.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.400
We just have that effect
on each other.

07:52.300 --> 07:55.400
Anyway, he's flying into town
this Friday just to see me.

07:55.700 --> 07:56.700
Oh, that's great.

07:56.900 --> 07:59.100
- Finally, l get to meet him.
- Yup.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.800
But since l'm not going to the dance,

08:01.100 --> 08:02.900
maybe l should resign
from the dance committee.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.400
- Oh, Kelly.
- l'm sorry, Bren,

08:05.700 --> 08:08.200
but he's only gonna be here
for the weekend.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.900
l'll still stay for the auditions.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.200
Why don't you just hire David?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>l had tailed Coach Chapman</i>

08:28.300 --> 08:30.800
<i>to his meeting</i>
<i>at the board of education,</i>

08:31.100 --> 08:32.799
<i>l caught him and Mrs, Teasley</i>
<i>in the hallway</i>

08:33.000 --> 08:36.500
<i>just long enough to find that</i>
<i>they weren't pleased l was there,</i>

08:36.799 --> 08:39.299
<i>When they assured me that no formal</i>
<i>decision on the fate of the game</i>

08:39.700 --> 08:42.100
<i>would be made until Monday</i>
<i>at the earliest,</i>

08:42.400 --> 08:45.000
<i>l took my cue and started to leave,</i>

08:50.500 --> 08:52.200
Excuse me.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.900
Who was that guy?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.100
The coach from my school.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.600
West Beverly l presume.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.100
Yeah.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.600
l'm Brandon Walsh.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.700
Jordan Bonner, from Shaw.

09:02.900 --> 09:05.000
So, what did the coach have to say?

09:05.300 --> 09:06.900
Well, there won't be any
formal decision made

09:07.100 --> 09:09.000
until Monday at the earliest.

09:09.300 --> 09:10.700
Anything else?

09:10.900 --> 09:13.100
Well, the prime concern is to
make sure it's safe

09:13.400 --> 09:15.500
to play the game next week.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.300
No kidding.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.200
This is so unnecessary.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.300
Well, two people were killed.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.300
By a rival set from another school.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.100
lt has nothing to do with you people.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.800
Considering we're supposed
to sit in the same bleachers

09:29.100 --> 09:30.300
as the two people who were killed,

09:30.600 --> 09:32.400
l'd say, yes, it does have something
to do with us.

09:32.700 --> 09:35.500
Not to mention the fact we're gonna
have 25 players down on the field.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.400
lt was an isolated incident.

09:38.700 --> 09:40.300
You don't have anything
to worry about, man.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.800
Unless some of your West Beverly
homies are planning something.

09:44.100 --> 09:46.900
Fortunately, we don't have much
street violence in Beverly Hills.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.500
But that doesn't stop you from being
an expert on the subject, now does it?

09:53.900 --> 09:56.600
lt's been really nice talking to you,
Jordan.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.100
They're going to cancel the game.
You know that, don't you?

09:59.300 --> 10:02.700
No. What l know is that
Coach Chapman, Mrs. Teasley

10:03.000 --> 10:05.500
and the whole damn school board
is in there on a Saturday afternoon

10:05.800 --> 10:08.400
trying to figure out any way they can
to make sure this thing happens.

10:09.300 --> 10:12.200
You know, Brandon,
Brandon of Beverly Hills,

10:12.500 --> 10:14.600
you don't know squat.

10:18.300 --> 10:21.300
<i>Less than 1 5 minutes later,</i>
<i>Coach Chapman and the others</i>

10:21.600 --> 10:23.100
<i>called a press conference</i>
<i>to announce</i>

10:23.400 --> 10:27.200
<i>that West</i> B <i>everly was officially</i>
<i>forfeiting our game with Shaw,</i>

10:27.800 --> 10:30.600
So, how's it going, Ace?

10:31.200 --> 10:32.200
lt's going.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.300
Would you like to read
what l've done so far?

10:37.500 --> 10:39.800
No. This is your editorial.

10:40.100 --> 10:42.800
Just as long as it's not libellous
or profane.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.100
Oh, now you tell me.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.100
Anyhow, how are we doing on time?

10:48.100 --> 10:50.300
l can have a draught to you in about
45 minutes.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.100
That's cutting it a little close,
don't you think?

10:53.400 --> 10:55.400
Not really. l mean, the computer
is already programmed.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.800
All we have to do is lay in the text.
lt's actually basic.

10:58.500 --> 11:01.500
So you're telling me
l can cut out of here and have a life?

11:01.900 --> 11:03.600
- See you tomorrow.
- Adios.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.200
Bye, Gil.

11:10.700 --> 11:14.900
Andrea, there's no way
l can have this done in 45 minutes.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.000
- Brandon--
- l'm doing the best l can.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.500
How much time do you really need?

11:19.700 --> 11:21.300
Let's say if we don't have it done
in an hour,

11:21.600 --> 11:23.000
we'll be in deep you know what.

11:23.300 --> 11:26.400
l'll have it to you in an hour,
l promise.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.900
Hey, come on, chief,

11:28.200 --> 11:30.800
this is what makes
journalism exciting.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.200
Okay, so the gig starts at 7:30,

11:34.500 --> 11:36.000
we need to have
the sound check done by--

11:36.200 --> 11:37.300
How you doing, Donna?

11:37.500 --> 11:39.700
Are we proud of this guy or what?
The Pigskin Prom.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.000
Are we thrilled out of our minds
he's playing there?

11:42.300 --> 11:44.400
How could you ask her
to come with us?

11:44.700 --> 11:46.500
- Donna, l can explain.
- Start explaining.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.900
- You know, Donna--
- Goodbye, Steve.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.300
That's just what l was gonna say.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.000
l'll call you later.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.700
Look, Donna, l've known Sue Scanlon
since she was a little girl.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.900
Well, she's not so little anymore,
David.

12:00.100 --> 12:01.900
She likes music.
She likes musicians.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.400
She's a groupie.

12:03.700 --> 12:04.900
She's Scott's kid sister.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.800
She asked me if she could go
with the band.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.200
What was l supposed to tell her?

12:08.400 --> 12:10.500
Why don't you tell her
that the band wouldn't be playing

12:10.700 --> 12:13.300
unless your very possessive girlfriend
wasn't on the dance committee.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.300
So, what are you saying,
l wasn't the best?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.900
Well, l kind of liked
Grudgemaster myself.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.500
Look, don't worry about Sue, okay?

12:32.100 --> 12:33.800
- Okay.
- Okay?

12:34.100 --> 12:35.200
Fine.

12:44.600 --> 12:45.800
Hi.

12:46.300 --> 12:47.700
You done?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.800
No, Andrea, l'm not done.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.100
And l'll never be done
as long as l have to hear you

12:52.300 --> 12:53.700
keep walking up and down
the hallway.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.200
- l'm-- l'm sorry. l'll go.
- Andrea--

12:56.500 --> 12:58.500
Brandon, you are wasting
valuable minutes here.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.300
Andrea, face it,

13:01.600 --> 13:02.900
we aren't going to make
our deadline.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.200
- Brandon--
- Hey, it's not a crisis.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.700
The computer is
already programmed,

13:07.000 --> 13:08.100
l know how to lay out the paper,

13:08.400 --> 13:10.300
everybody will have a copy of
the B <i>laze</i> on their desk

13:10.500 --> 13:11.600
first thing tomorrow.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.400
Hey, l'm the coeditor of the paper
for God's sakes,

13:15.700 --> 13:17.100
will you give me a little credit here?

13:17.800 --> 13:20.200
lf you stick in any swear words,
l'm gonna kill you.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.400
Good night, Andrea.

13:21.700 --> 13:24.300
And don't worry.
l know exactly what l'm doing.

13:24.600 --> 13:25.800
l know.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.200
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.900
- Goodbye. Bye.
- Goodbye. Goodbye.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.600
<i>No one knew what Jordan</i> B <i>onner</i>
<i>and l had up our sleeves,</i>

13:37.900 --> 13:40.600
<i>but a window of opportunity</i>
<i>had opened,</i>

13:44.000 --> 13:45.500
Hey, it's me.

13:46.100 --> 13:48.400
Yeah, l'm alone. Are you crazy?

13:49.300 --> 13:51.000
No, nobody knows we're doing this,

13:51.300 --> 13:53.900
but they'll all find out soon enough,
won't they?

13:55.300 --> 13:58.100
Yeah, anyway come when you can,
l'll be here.

14:05.600 --> 14:08.000
<i>Even though l am editor</i>
<i>of the</i> West Beverly Blaze <i>,</i>

14:08.500 --> 14:11.200
<i>l never realised how isolated</i>
<i>our school is,</i>

14:11.900 --> 14:14.400
<i>We can't see past</i>
<i>our own concerns,</i>

14:14.700 --> 14:17.700
<i>l guess l knew that</i>
<i>before the game was cancelled,</i>

14:18.100 --> 14:21.200
B <i>ut it still caught me by surprise</i>
<i>how removed everyone was</i>

14:21.400 --> 14:23.000
<i>from what was really going on,</i>

14:23.300 --> 14:25.900
Guess who has dinner reservations
Friday night at Spago?

14:26.200 --> 14:27.200
Oh, very cool.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.400
Oh, yeah, are people still eating
at Spago?

14:29.600 --> 14:31.500
l'll let you know after l go there
with my father.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.100
So your father's in town?

14:33.300 --> 14:34.400
He called.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.200
He is coming in Friday night for sure.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.300
And wouldn't you know she's using
that as an excuse

14:38.600 --> 14:39.800
not to come to the dance.

14:39.900 --> 14:42.400
A dance without Kelly Taylor
really isn't a dance at all.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.900
Oh, thank you. Bye.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.900
So does that mean
if l get a note from my dad?

14:48.200 --> 14:49.200
No, Dylan.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.700
l have a novel idea.

14:51.300 --> 14:53.700
What if you just cancel the dance
all together?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.200
Are you out of your mind?

14:55.300 --> 14:57.800
l've got two A&R guys coming here
to scope out my main man.

14:58.300 --> 15:00.100
Gee, don't make me nervous
or anything.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.600
You'll do fine.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.300
And what about everyone else,
Donna?

15:03.500 --> 15:04.600
What are they supposed to do?

15:04.900 --> 15:07.000
You know, we're all upset
that the game was cancelled,

15:07.200 --> 15:09.300
but that doesn't mean the world
has to grind to a halt.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.400
Well, it just seems to me having
a dance in honour of the football team

15:12.700 --> 15:14.700
without a football game
is completely ludicrous.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.400
Why don't they move
the game up here?

15:16.600 --> 15:18.700
And risk a drive-by shooting
at halftime?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.900
l think the PTA
would be really into that.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.100
Brandon, you're making it sound like
it's our fault the game was cancelled.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.200
l mean, come on, the guys at Shaw,
they never agreed to play here anyway.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.800
And as much as l'm a sports fanatic,

15:29.100 --> 15:32.200
people around here are more into
having a dance than a football game.

15:32.500 --> 15:33.600
What do you think, sweetheart?

15:33.900 --> 15:35.400
You're not gonna drag me into this.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.900
l'll just stay over here in the neutral
zone if that's okay with you.

15:39.300 --> 15:41.100
The neutral zone?

15:42.500 --> 15:44.200
<i>You hear a phrase sometimes</i>

15:44.500 --> 15:46.900
<i>and something clicks</i>
<i>and you're gone,</i>

15:47.900 --> 15:50.000
<i>So there l was chasing a wild idea</i>

15:50.300 --> 15:53.000
<i>that just might get this game played</i>
<i>after all,</i>

15:53.300 --> 15:54.700
<i>And as l drove south</i>

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
<i>through a part of town</i>
<i>l'd never actually seen before,</i>

15:58.300 --> 16:00.000
<i>l kept thinking of Henry Thomas,</i>

16:00.200 --> 16:02.500
<i>my boss at the</i>
B <i>everly Hills</i> B <i>each Club,</i>

16:05.200 --> 16:07.900
<i>l couldn't help but wonder where his</i>
<i>sporting goods store was located</i>

16:08.200 --> 16:10.000
<i>before it got trashed in the riots,</i>

16:10.300 --> 16:12.800
<i>l wondered how it could be</i>
<i>that l didn't know,</i>

16:18.300 --> 16:20.200
B <i>y the time l got to</i>
<i>Shaw High School</i>

16:20.300 --> 16:22.200
<i>and made my way past</i>
<i>the metal detector</i>

16:22.400 --> 16:24.400
<i>that had been installed</i>
<i>since the shooting,</i>

16:24.700 --> 16:28.000
<i>l was convinced that we would</i>
<i>not only get the game rescheduled,</i>

16:28.300 --> 16:31.700
<i>but would absolutely have a chance</i>
<i>to change the world,</i>

16:32.000 --> 16:33.400
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

16:33.600 --> 16:37.200
<i>Jordan</i> B <i>onner didn't quite see it</i>
<i>the same way l did,</i>

16:38.100 --> 16:40.700
l'm sorry, Walsh, l don't mean
to insult your intelligence here,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.200
but either you are totally ignorant,
or naive in the extreme.

16:43.400 --> 16:46.500
What is so naive about going to
the School Board with a united front,

16:46.700 --> 16:49.700
telling them to move the game to a
neutral field, away from the violence?

16:50.100 --> 16:52.400
Switzerland, that's a neutral country.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.700
We can play the game there.

16:56.100 --> 16:58.200
You got an answer for everything,
don't you, Jordan?

16:58.500 --> 16:59.900
About this stuff...

17:00.900 --> 17:01.900
...yeah, l do.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.500
You know, l came here in good faith,
man,

17:04.700 --> 17:06.300
and you just keep dissing me,
what's with that?

17:06.599 --> 17:07.800
What do you want me to say?

17:08.400 --> 17:11.000
lt was very noble of you
to trek down here.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.200
Man, you need to understand
what's real.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.200
lf we play the game anywhere
but here,

17:15.400 --> 17:17.500
we might as well hand the community
over to the gangs.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.200
The truth is, until we can afford

17:20.500 --> 17:23.000
to have everybody in this world
live happily ever after,

17:23.300 --> 17:27.200
we need to take a stand right here
where the people can see us, hear us

17:27.599 --> 17:29.800
and understand
that we are not afraid to be.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.900
<i>And then Jordan handed me</i>
<i>an editorial he'd written</i>

17:36.200 --> 17:37.700
<i>about the last couple days,</i>

17:37.900 --> 17:40.300
<i>and another idea, a better idea</i>

17:41.100 --> 17:43.100
<i>began to take shape,</i>

17:47.900 --> 17:50.500
This was Bose Hinton's locker.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.800
One of the kids that died.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.300
He was my friend.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.500
Was he a--?

18:00.800 --> 18:02.500
A gang member?

18:03.800 --> 18:05.600
Does it matter?

18:06.800 --> 18:08.500
No, l guess not.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.000
You see, what pissed me off,

18:10.200 --> 18:13.400
was that both those dudes who died
were my friends.

18:13.700 --> 18:15.800
And all l kept hearing about from you
was a football game.

18:16.100 --> 18:19.600
Hey, man, it was never just the game.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.000
l don't know, l--

18:22.200 --> 18:24.900
The whole thing really got to me,
you know?

18:25.300 --> 18:27.400
You should write a eulogy.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.900
l didn't know your friends.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.100
A eulogy for the game, man.

18:34.100 --> 18:37.300
B <i>y the time l was ready to leave,</i>
<i>we had a plan,</i>

18:37.500 --> 18:40.600
<i>He had already written a eulogy</i>
<i>for his fallen friends,</i>

18:40.900 --> 18:42.400
<i>l'd write one for the game,</i>

18:42.600 --> 18:44.100
<i>For a way of life,</i>

18:44.400 --> 18:47.800
<i>We'd publish our pieces together,</i>
<i>in both our papers,</i>

18:48.200 --> 18:49.900
<i>Side by side,</i>

18:51.100 --> 18:53.600
<i>l remember thinking things</i>
<i>were beginning to fall into place</i>

18:53.900 --> 18:56.300
<i>as l crossed back into the greenbelt</i>
<i>of</i> B <i>everly Hills,</i>

18:56.600 --> 19:00.700
<i>l only had one potential problem now,</i>
<i>Gil and Andrea,</i>

19:06.800 --> 19:09.000
We can't publish this. This--

19:09.500 --> 19:11.700
l don't even know what to call this,
it's so over the top.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.700
That's the point,
it's supposed to be incendiary.

19:13.900 --> 19:14.900
And racist?

19:15.200 --> 19:17.900
He practically calls Coach Chapman
a Nazi. We'll be sued.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.000
And why did he have to use
so many swear words?

19:20.300 --> 19:21.900
Because he's angry.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.600
You want us to put a warning label
on it like they do on CDs?

19:24.900 --> 19:26.000
Pretend it's a rap song?

19:26.300 --> 19:27.500
- Brandon.
- Come on, Gil.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.400
This is the best take we're gonna get
on the two kids that were killed.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.100
- Look, what if Brandon edits it?
- No.

19:33.700 --> 19:36.300
Jordan and l are not gonna edit
each other, l insisted on that.

19:36.600 --> 19:37.600
Brandon, it's too long.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.600
Swear words or not,
it's gotta be edited.

19:39.900 --> 19:41.400
Really, Brandon.
l mean, help us out here,

19:41.600 --> 19:43.800
because l'm having a very hard time
convincing myself

19:44.100 --> 19:45.400
that you believe what l'm reading.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.900
The point is that he believes it.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.000
And that's why he should publish it.

19:49.300 --> 19:51.200
You want to take a stand,
then write your own editorial.

19:51.500 --> 19:52.600
but this isn't gonna fly.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.400
Sorry, Ace.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.200
And whatever you write,
make it great.

20:03.400 --> 20:07.500
<i>Two kids were shot to death and the</i>
<i>buzz on this quad continues to be,</i>

20:07.900 --> 20:09.700
<i>''At least they didn't cancel</i>

20:10.000 --> 20:11.500
<i>And we wonder</i>

20:12.800 --> 20:14.400

20:36.400 --> 20:37.800
- Jordan?
- Brandon, how are you doing?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.900
- Good, how are you doing?
- Okay.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.900
- l got something for you, man.
- What's this?

20:43.200 --> 20:44.600
My editorial.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.700
Oh, l already programmed it
into the computer, man.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.800
l didn't change a word.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.600
- You were gonna print that?
- Yeah, we made a deal.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.400
You really are naive.

20:55.900 --> 20:56.900
What do you mean?

20:57.100 --> 20:59.900
That was me getting through
my anger.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.200
This is me getting through.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.500
lt's only two paragraphs.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.200
Yeah. Short, sweet, lean and clean.

21:16.800 --> 21:20.000
''Anything quieter than a gunshot
people don't hear.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.900
And even then,
they don't listen for long.''

21:24.200 --> 21:26.100
- lt's good.
- Thanks.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.700
A lot of people are gonna get
to read that, thanks to you.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.500
And thanks to you,
l gotta redo the layout.

21:33.700 --> 21:35.900
So, what do you got for
the readers of the <i>Shaw Courier?</i>

21:36.200 --> 21:38.200
Hot off the presses.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.900
- This looks very professional.
- Well, we try.

21:44.900 --> 21:48.200
- What?
- l appreciate the invite, bro,

21:48.500 --> 21:50.700
but l think we're doing
a huge thing here

21:51.000 --> 21:52.600
just by publishing
these two pieces together.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.600
Yeah, but if we really want
to shake things up,

21:55.900 --> 21:57.800
we gotta do something
everybody's gonna remember

21:58.000 --> 21:59.300
for the rest of their lives.

22:00.700 --> 22:01.800
l think they will, man.

22:02.900 --> 22:04.600
Yeah, me too.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.400
Hey, Bren, how are you doing?

22:18.600 --> 22:21.000
''Since the administration
didn't let us have a football game,

22:21.300 --> 22:24.300
l, Brandon Walsh, personally invite
each of you at Shaw High School

22:24.600 --> 22:27.200
to join me Friday
at the Pigskin Prom.''

22:27.500 --> 22:28.600
You had no right to do that.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.700
Oh, come on, Bren.
lt'll be good for ticket sales.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.600
From the beginning, you've been
telling me how trivial this dance is.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.900
Well, congratulations, Brandon,
you win.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.100
- They're now going to cancel it.
- Brenda, will you relax?

22:39.400 --> 22:41.000
Let's just wait and see what happens,
okay?

22:41.300 --> 22:44.300
Wait and see? Mrs. Teasley is in there
talking to Mr. Meyers right now.

22:44.500 --> 22:47.400
Brenda, l really think
you're overreacting.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.600
Brandon.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.800
Brandon.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.100
Brandon.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.900
l'm sorry that you feel betrayed,
Andrea, l really am,

23:08.200 --> 23:09.600
but this was just something
l had to do.

23:09.900 --> 23:12.200
You had to lie? You had to print
these editorials behind my back?

23:12.500 --> 23:15.200
After all we've been through, you
couldn't take me in your confidence?

23:15.500 --> 23:18.200
Look, Andrea, this isn't happening
the way it was supposed to.

23:18.500 --> 23:20.800
lt probably would have worked out
if you'd trusted your friends.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.000
Hey, l said l'm sorry.

23:23.300 --> 23:25.700
But not really, are you?

23:27.600 --> 23:29.600
You and l have got some
repair work to do, pal.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.200
What did you say to Mrs. Teasley?

23:31.500 --> 23:33.100
l said we were struggling
to meet a deadline

23:33.400 --> 23:35.200
and some copy fell
through the cracks.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.200
Excuse me,
nothing fell through the cracks.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.800
You could have told her the truth, Gil.

23:39.100 --> 23:41.100
The truth would have gotten you
booted out of school.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.000
You covered up for him?

23:43.300 --> 23:45.200
Let's try to keep this in perspective.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.600
No, let's just try to remember
my name was on the masthead

23:47.900 --> 23:49.100
before either one of you came here.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.500
- Andrea, come on--
- Look, l'm sorry.

23:51.900 --> 23:53.600
l gotta take a walk.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.400
Talk about some repair work.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.000
Brandon, l wouldn't have covered
for you

24:03.300 --> 24:05.200
if l hadn't read Jordan's first editorial

24:05.500 --> 24:08.800
and realised what a big concession
you made by changing it.

24:09.200 --> 24:10.700
l didn't change it. Jordan did that.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.500
Well, at least one of you
used good judgement.

24:15.800 --> 24:19.200
l'm sorry, Gil, but two kids got shot
watching a high school football game

24:19.500 --> 24:21.600
and nobody around here
gives a damn.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.500
l mean, we live on this
sheltered island.

24:23.800 --> 24:25.700
That's why l had to invite
the Shaw kids to the dance.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.400
Look, l know your motives
are solid,

24:27.600 --> 24:30.000
but l've got to be back in
Mrs. Teasley's office in 1 5 minutes

24:30.300 --> 24:33.000
to try to talk her out
of cancelling the dance.

24:33.500 --> 24:37.000
- Why you?
- Because l'm the faculty sponsor.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.300
You're kidding, right?

24:39.600 --> 24:43.200
What can l say?
l'm a sucker for girls in party shoes.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.600
Well, Brenda's positive Mrs. T's
gonna cancel it.

24:47.900 --> 24:50.300
She probably thinks l did this
just to ruin her life.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.800
Don't defend my brother, Dylan.
He's a heinous traitor.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.100
l'm not talking about Brandon.

24:55.400 --> 24:56.900
l'm talking about this guy,
Jordan Bonner.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.600
The thing he wrote is right on.

24:58.800 --> 25:00.200
Well, what's it say?

25:00.500 --> 25:03.200
Well, paraphrased,
you should be nice to your brother.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.400
What do you care if the dance
is cancelled, anyway?

25:05.700 --> 25:07.100
You weren't ever going to go,
admit it.

25:07.300 --> 25:10.100
Oh, that's not true. l was gonna
swoop in for the last tango.

25:10.500 --> 25:11.900
Well, if the dance is called off,

25:12.100 --> 25:14.500
why don't we go to Spago
so l can finally meet Kelly's dad.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.100
Bren, the odds of Kelly's father
showing aren't that great.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.500
He just called her last weekend.

25:19.700 --> 25:20.700
l still wouldn't bet on it.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.800
Well, maybe she knows more about it
than you do.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.200
l mean, why is it around here
that everyone is so certain

25:25.500 --> 25:27.300
they know what's best
for everyone else?

25:32.600 --> 25:36.400
Hey, Walsh,
stick to sports reporting.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.900
- That hurt.
- lt was supposed to.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.600
So is this all an elaborate ruse to get
out of going to the dance with me?

25:45.900 --> 25:47.600
Believe me, l'm not that clever.

25:47.900 --> 25:48.800
Brandon.

25:51.700 --> 25:54.000
lt's my fan club. l'll see you later.

25:54.300 --> 25:57.200
For what it's worth,
l really admired what you wrote.

25:57.500 --> 25:58.900
Thanks.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.700
- Brandon, if this dance is cancelled--
- And it's gonna be.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.900
Next time you find two A&R guys
willing to come to a high school dance.

26:09.500 --> 26:12.700
Brandon, we sold over 400 tickets.
When will David get another chance?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.800
Hopefully tonight.
Guys, it's not over until it's over.

26:23.400 --> 26:26.600
Look, a lot of people think
l screwed up.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Can l say screwed up?

26:28.200 --> 26:29.700
Brandon, Mr. Meyers already explained

26:29.900 --> 26:32.500
how complex laying out the paper is
with the new computer system.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.500
lt's not that.

26:35.700 --> 26:38.400
l know he's gonna be talking with you
about not cancelling the dance.

26:38.600 --> 26:43.300
We went over these exact same issues
when we decided to cancel the game.

26:43.800 --> 26:48.300
Our first obligation is the safety
of students at West Beverly.

26:48.700 --> 26:51.600
The violence at Shaw
really leaves us no choice.

26:51.900 --> 26:54.900
Mrs. Teasley, l've been to Shaw
and l've met some of the students

26:55.200 --> 26:56.500
and they're not so different from us.

26:56.700 --> 27:00.600
This isn't about the colour of people's
skin or how much money they have.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.500
lt's about gunshots.

27:05.200 --> 27:07.700
So, what you're saying
is if the shooting hadn't happened,

27:08.000 --> 27:09.900
they would be welcome here,
right, Mrs. Teasley?

27:12.000 --> 27:13.600
Correct me if l'm wrong,

27:13.800 --> 27:15.000
students from Shaw High School

27:15.200 --> 27:17.900
have never been welcome
at this school, have they?

27:20.800 --> 27:23.000
So Mrs. Teasley called
the principal at Shaw,

27:23.300 --> 27:25.600
and he said that none of the kids
would probably show up anyway.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.400
And then they talked to Jordan,
the other editor that Brandon knows,

27:28.700 --> 27:30.500
and he said he wasn't even going.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.900
Sounds like quite the popular event
you've got going.

27:33.200 --> 27:36.200
Yeah, at least it's going. All we're doing
is adding a couple of security guards.

27:36.500 --> 27:39.100
Well, whoever said there's no more
heroes, never met your brother.

27:39.400 --> 27:42.000
Yeah, Brandon's really good
at making you feel grateful to him

27:42.200 --> 27:44.300
for saving something
that he screwed up in the first place.

27:44.900 --> 27:47.500
Well, the only bummer is that
Sue Scanlon is back in the picture.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.600
l mean, she was cornering David
at the DJ booth

27:49.900 --> 27:52.000
before Mrs. Teasley even finished
her announcement.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.800
Donna, Sue's a good kid.
She just has a couple of problems.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.100
Oh, and lucky me.

27:59.300 --> 28:01.200
l get to worry about them.

28:01.500 --> 28:03.800
Looking like that, you don't have
to worry about anything.

28:04.100 --> 28:05.800
Okay, what do you think?

28:07.200 --> 28:08.300
Bren?

28:08.500 --> 28:09.700
Kelly, are you sure about this?

28:10.300 --> 28:11.300
Too mature?

28:11.700 --> 28:13.600
No, it's just--

28:13.900 --> 28:16.100
l mean, when was the last time
you actually saw your father?

28:18.200 --> 28:20.500
What right do you have
to make judgements on my family?

28:20.800 --> 28:21.800
Kelly, l didn't.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.900
Brenda, you live in Walsh-land.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.400
You have no idea what goes on
in other people's families.

28:26.700 --> 28:29.800
And if you don't know anything about
something, maybe you should shut up.

28:35.300 --> 28:38.300
So tell me honestly.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.500
Well, it looks a little like...

28:43.300 --> 28:44.700
Like what?

28:45.600 --> 28:48.300
Like something your so-called
manager would pick out for you.

28:49.900 --> 28:52.200
l told him that,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.100
Okay, now me.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.700
Be honest.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.000
You look beautiful.

28:58.600 --> 28:59.800
Thank you.

29:00.700 --> 29:03.600
So you sure about not going
to the dance?

29:06.400 --> 29:08.700
My father's just running a little late.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.700
- But what's new, right?
- Right.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.400
Well, if you change your mind...

29:15.100 --> 29:16.100
Thanks.

29:18.300 --> 29:19.400
Wish me luck.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.400
Good luck.

29:22.400 --> 29:23.600
David?

29:27.300 --> 29:28.700
Good luck.

29:35.700 --> 29:37.700
Hey, guys, take the night off.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.300
Gil Meyers will be looking
after us tonight.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.000
That's very reassuring, Brandon.

29:42.300 --> 29:44.600
lt was meant to be, Dad.
He takes his job very seriously.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.900
Then where was he when you drove
by yourself down to Shaw?

29:48.600 --> 29:50.300
l didn't mention it to him
until afte <i>rw</i> ards.

29:50.900 --> 29:52.800
That ought to tell you something.

29:53.100 --> 29:54.700
Look, Brandon,

29:54.900 --> 29:57.600
we're very proud
of your journalistic skills,

29:57.800 --> 30:00.000
but what are we supposed to do
when there are gunshots

30:00.300 --> 30:02.500
and you drive toward them?

30:03.000 --> 30:04.400
l don't know, Mom.

30:04.600 --> 30:07.500
Building a fence around Beverly Hills,
lock me in my room.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.300
l'll get that,

30:11.600 --> 30:12.600
if you think it's safe.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.300
Oh, honey, you look terrific.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.000
Yeah, well, l better.
l'm on my own tonight.

30:22.500 --> 30:24.000
- No Dylan?
- Nope.

30:24.300 --> 30:25.400
l'm a totally independent woman,

30:25.600 --> 30:27.100
which is why
l need to borrow the car.

30:27.400 --> 30:28.900
Oh, the keys are--

30:29.200 --> 30:30.300
On the table by the door.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.700
Thanks.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.700
- Who was it?
- Jordan.

30:39.600 --> 30:40.900
What's wrong?

30:41.100 --> 30:42.100
He said some kids from Shaw--

30:42.400 --> 30:44.500
A lot of kids from Shaw
are on their way to the dance.

30:45.100 --> 30:46.700
Oh, that's because you invited them,
Brandon.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.200
Yeah, but he said some of them
have been drinking.

30:51.300 --> 30:52.600
The mood's not pretty, Bren.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.200
This isn't good.

30:55.400 --> 30:56.500
We better get over there.

30:56.700 --> 30:58.200
<i>Mike, mike check it</i>

30:58.500 --> 31:00.900
<i>Yo, yo, here l am</i>

31:01.200 --> 31:02.900
<i>Mike, mike check it</i>

31:03.000 --> 31:04.900
<i>Yo, l want a, want a,</i>
<i>Want a mike check</i>

31:05.200 --> 31:07.200
<i>l want a mike, l want a,</i>
<i>Want a, Want a mike check</i>

31:07.400 --> 31:09.300
B <i>ring the level up</i>
<i>l want a mike check</i>

31:09.800 --> 31:12.400
<i>Yeah, l want a mike check, yo</i>

31:12.600 --> 31:14.000
We need some more reverb here.

31:14.300 --> 31:15.300
He sounds terrific.

31:15.500 --> 31:19.000
That comes from knowing you're part
of a professional management team.

31:19.700 --> 31:21.200
Hey, l hooked him up with the band,
didn't l?

31:21.400 --> 31:22.700
l thought David found them.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.500
l was in the room when he called.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.500
Yeah. He really is terrific.

31:41.100 --> 31:43.000
That girl has got to go.

31:43.300 --> 31:46.300
Yeah, she definitely is user-friendly,
huh?

31:48.400 --> 31:50.000
Donna.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.100
Where's Mr. Meyers?

31:53.400 --> 31:55.800
- He headed outside for some coffee.
- Well, when is he coming back?

31:56.100 --> 31:57.800
- He didn't say.
- Great.

31:57.900 --> 31:59.600
Look, don't worry.
Everything's under control.

31:59.900 --> 32:01.200
- l wish, Donna.
- What's going on?

32:01.500 --> 32:02.500
What is going on?

32:02.700 --> 32:04.000
Guess who's coming to dinner?

32:04.200 --> 32:06.600
l realise the dance
hasn't officially started yet,

32:06.900 --> 32:08.500
but you can let him in. He's with me.

32:08.700 --> 32:10.900
- Well, who are you?
- l'm the head of the dance committee.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.600
And they're both with me.

32:17.300 --> 32:18.300
All right, go ahead.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.800
Hi, l'm Brenda Walsh,
l'm Brandon's sister.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.500
- Jordan Bonner.
- Hi, l'm Donna.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.100
- Hi, Donna. How you doing?
- Good.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.700
Those guards, should have known
we'd get stuck with a bunch of bozos.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Well, maybe nobody will show.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.900
l don't see them losing interest
on their way down here.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.000
You might wanna get
some metal detectors.

32:36.300 --> 32:37.900
Metal detectors?

32:39.300 --> 32:40.300
Where's Mr. Meyers?

32:43.200 --> 32:44.900
lf these dudes crash, l'm dead meat.

32:45.100 --> 32:47.800
Just be glad you don't do
country and western.

32:48.500 --> 32:51.400
Oh, God. Do me a favour,
just get her to back off, will you?

32:51.800 --> 32:53.800
David, just so we're on
the same wavelength.

32:54.100 --> 32:56.900
People usually go into this business
to get babes.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.700
Where's your rock 'n' roll attitude,
man?

32:58.900 --> 33:00.000
You're pond scum.

33:00.300 --> 33:02.500
That's it. That's the attitude.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.700
Go for it, big guy.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.100
Your band is hot.

33:07.400 --> 33:11.000
Yeah, well, we wanna sound our best
when the riots break out.

33:15.300 --> 33:17.100
Don't be nervous.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
- Here. l'm good at this.
- Sue.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.600
Just relax.

33:22.900 --> 33:25.600
Sue, where's Donna?

33:26.700 --> 33:27.900
Three's a crowd.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.600
Don't you think?

33:29.800 --> 33:32.200
Look, it's a real ego trip for you
to be here with me, okay,

33:32.500 --> 33:36.200
but l just can't get it out of my mind
the fact that you're Scott's little sister.

33:37.900 --> 33:40.300
You may think of me that way...

33:40.700 --> 33:42.900
...but that's not the way
you look at me.

33:43.100 --> 33:44.400
Sue, it's a reflex.

33:44.700 --> 33:46.700
Like when the doctor hits your knee
and your foot jumps.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.800
lt doesn't mean anything.

33:49.300 --> 33:51.800
- lt means something.
- Sue.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.800
Look, your brother
was my best friend, okay.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.900
l mean, this is like incestuous
or something.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.700
You don't know what you're missing,
David.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.199
- How many are coming?
- lt doesn't matter.

34:19.500 --> 34:21.600
- We'll be ready for them.
- Hey, guys, l'm telling you this

34:21.900 --> 34:24.199
so everything will stay cool,
not that you'll be ready for them.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.199
Yeah, that's why God
created security guards.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.100
l just wish he'd created more of them.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.800
Gil.

34:31.100 --> 34:32.800
- Gil.
- Hey Brandon, look who l found.

34:33.100 --> 34:34.600
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:35.400 --> 34:36.800
What's wrong?

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Just about everything.

34:45.699 --> 34:47.199
Hey, Nat.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.600
What do you recommend tonight,
bud?

34:49.900 --> 34:51.800
Try the corner table.

34:54.199 --> 34:55.400
Here, take this to her.

34:55.699 --> 34:57.000
But a word to the wise,

34:57.100 --> 35:00.000
don't compliment her on her dress.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.900
Nat used to tell me

35:09.200 --> 35:12.800
that there were very few problems
a mega-burger couldn't solve.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.900
He didn't even have the courtesy
to call this time.

35:19.600 --> 35:22.300
He had some woman
who claimed to be his secretary

35:22.600 --> 35:24.700
call and leave a message for me
at Spago.

35:27.700 --> 35:30.000
''Your father is very sorry,

35:30.300 --> 35:32.900
but he'll make it up to you next time.''

35:34.400 --> 35:36.200
Some things just never change.

35:37.900 --> 35:40.900
Last time this happened,
l called Cliff Burman

35:41.200 --> 35:44.700
and we got high in his parents'
pool house for three days.

35:46.200 --> 35:50.000
My mom didn't even know l was gone,
she was so coked up.

35:53.400 --> 35:54.800
Well, l hear Cliff's in town.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.800
We could call him right now
if you want to.

35:58.600 --> 35:59.800
What are you saying?

36:00.000 --> 36:02.600
l'm saying that that was back then.

36:02.900 --> 36:04.700
And some people do change, Kelly.

36:11.300 --> 36:13.000
l was so messed up back then.

36:14.500 --> 36:15.900
You know, Steve was right.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.100
Steve?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.800
And what did Steve have to say
about me?

36:21.100 --> 36:22.700
He said that a dance
without Kelly Taylor

36:23.000 --> 36:25.500
isn't really a dance at all.

36:25.700 --> 36:27.800
lt's just a bunch of people
in a big room

36:28.100 --> 36:32.000
kind of waving their limbs around
to very loud music.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.700
<i>V</i> ery loud David Silver music.

36:35.600 --> 36:39.700
- So do you wanna go check it out?
- Yeah.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.300
- All right.
- Dylan.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.100
l don't know whether to laugh or cry.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.700
Nobody does.

36:54.900 --> 36:56.500
Come on.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.200
This seems like the happening spot.

37:04.400 --> 37:07.100
l don't know, Kell.
Something's not right.

37:13.500 --> 37:16.200
Look, look, look. This dance
is for West Beverly students only.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.700
Yo, man, l was personally invited
by Brandon Walsh, okay?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.300
We gonna form a circle, all right?

37:20.600 --> 37:21.800
- A circle, man.
- All right?

37:22.000 --> 37:23.100
Just turn around and walk away.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.400
Gentlemen, excuse the lady, please.

37:25.700 --> 37:27.500
- So, what is this?
- What's up, man?

37:27.700 --> 37:29.900
- Why are they getting in?
- Because they go to school here.

37:30.100 --> 37:32.100
- You're out of here.
- So it's like that, huh?

37:32.400 --> 37:34.300
- We gotta go to school here.
- Hey, look.

37:35.300 --> 37:36.900
Now, see,
l told you we're invited, man.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.700
That guy's from my school.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.700
Hey, guys, let them in.

37:41.500 --> 37:42.500
Are you in charge here?

37:42.600 --> 37:43.700
No, are you?

37:44.000 --> 37:45.800
Hey, l'm in charge here.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.900
Let them in.

37:50.700 --> 37:51.700
Your call.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.300
That's right.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.800
- Hey, one at a time.
- Get off me, man.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.300
Hey, man, these guys your friends?

38:20.900 --> 38:21.900
l don't think so.

38:24.000 --> 38:24.900
Look around you.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.400
- Nice guy.
- Loc's cool,

38:29.700 --> 38:31.900
but some of these other guys...

39:08.900 --> 39:11.100
Hey, hey, hey, guys. Guys come on.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.100
Give it a rest, would you?

39:16.000 --> 39:17.300
David, let's get
some music happening.

39:30.900 --> 39:32.700
Why isn't anybody dancing.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.700
l think they're too paralyzed by fear.

39:34.900 --> 39:36.600
l really wish somebody would dance.

39:39.800 --> 39:42.200
- l just didn't see this coming.
- No one could have, man.

39:42.500 --> 39:44.500
Are you out of your mind, Brandon?
Anybody could have.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.900
We've positioned ourselves.
How do we turn up the lights?

39:47.200 --> 39:49.600
Why don't you just give it a rest?
You're only making things worse.

39:49.900 --> 39:51.100
Hey, that's enough, Brandon.

39:51.700 --> 39:54.300
Brandon? So you're the genius
who invited these guys.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.100
David, just keep playing.

40:07.600 --> 40:09.600
Wach out. Wach out. Wach out.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.700
Break it up.
Get the Shaw kid out of here.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.700
Hey, hey, hey, they're both ours.
Let them go.

40:15.900 --> 40:17.200
He goes to West Beverly.

40:18.600 --> 40:20.700
- Just messing around.
- Like we always do.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.300
Man, you guys been in everybody's
face since we got here, man.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.700
- Yo, man, it's all right.
- No, man, it's not all right.

40:26.800 --> 40:27.800
What you want?

40:28.100 --> 40:29.900
Do you want to dance?

40:38.600 --> 40:41.500
Come on, we have the whole floor
to ourselves.

41:03.800 --> 41:06.400
So, Brandon of Beverly Hills,

41:06.700 --> 41:08.400
wanna dance?

41:08.800 --> 41:09.900
No.

41:10.200 --> 41:12.500
Don't you know me
better than that, chief?

41:13.200 --> 41:15.500
But does this mean l'm forgiven?

41:15.700 --> 41:17.200
Maybe.

41:17.500 --> 41:19.900
Maybe l just want to torture you.

41:21.200 --> 41:22.800
<i>Yup, switch it up, up, up</i>

41:23.100 --> 41:25.100
B <i>ecause the problem</i>
<i>Of the racist nation is growing</i>

41:25.400 --> 41:27.100
<i>And l'm not going to sit back, back</i>
<i>And relax</i>

41:27.300 --> 41:28.400
<i>While brothers kill each other</i>

41:29.300 --> 41:30.900
Hey, don't touch that.
You'll ruin the sound.

41:31.200 --> 41:32.400
Trust me.

41:32.500 --> 41:34.400
<i>And l'm not going to sit back back</i>
<i>And relax</i>

41:34.600 --> 41:35.700
<i>While brothers kill each other</i>

41:36.000 --> 41:38.100
<i>How one cannot respect another</i>
<i>Makes me wonder</i>

41:38.400 --> 41:40.200
<i>l use the Force just like a Jedi</i>
<i>Obi-Wan can't touch me</i>

41:40.400 --> 41:42.600
<i>My lyrics furl along the sides</i>
<i>Of what's to make a positivity</i>

41:42.900 --> 41:45.000
<i>No dissin' me</i>
B <i>ecause of a position</i>

41:45.200 --> 41:46.200
<i>Clear my throat</i>

41:46.500 --> 41:49.100
<i>Listen, they say follow the many</i>
B <i>ut the many can't catch knowledge</i>

41:49.300 --> 41:51.400
<i>l learned about the hurt</i>
<i>When they bust us up in college</i>

41:51.700 --> 41:53.500
<i>They tried to suck me in</i>
<i>And made me go crazy</i>

41:53.700 --> 41:55.600
<i>Acted hazy, thought to myself</i>
<i>''Me shouldn't be lazy''</i>

41:55.800 --> 41:57.900

<i>So l was respected</i>

41:58.200 --> 42:00.000

<i>Come on</i>

42:56.800 --> 43:00.000
l told you l'd show up
for the last waltz.

43:05.700 --> 43:06.700
Hey.

43:07.300 --> 43:09.100
Oh, yeah.

43:09.400 --> 43:10.900
Come here.

43:15.100 --> 43:16.800
You were great.

43:17.100 --> 43:18.800
You are great.

43:22.500 --> 43:24.800
Listen, that thing about Sue--

43:25.100 --> 43:28.800
Donna, there is no thing with Sue.

43:34.400 --> 43:36.100
Bose Hinton and Paul Browning,

43:36.200 --> 43:38.600
my two friends who got shot,

43:38.900 --> 43:41.000
they would have liked
to have been here tonight.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.200
They would have liked you,
Brandon Walsh.

43:43.500 --> 43:45.700
You would have pissed them off.

43:46.900 --> 43:49.700
Walsh pisses everybody off.

43:54.700 --> 43:56.000
So who are those guys anyway.

43:56.600 --> 43:58.500
They're football players.

43:59.400 --> 44:00.800
Those are them, huh?

44:01.800 --> 44:05.300
Undefeated, untied,
the Masters of the Universe.

44:05.900 --> 44:08.700
Really? Because, you see,
l have this theory

44:09.000 --> 44:10.900
that if you get a couple of guys
from one team,

44:11.200 --> 44:14.100
a couple of guys from another team
together at--

44:14.400 --> 44:16.600
l don't know,
we'll say a high school dance.

44:17.600 --> 44:22.700
That sometimes, somewhere,
like maybe 1 0 a.m. tomorrow,

44:23.000 --> 44:25.300
a football game will be played.

44:26.600 --> 44:28.600
l bet you they're looking for referees
right now.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.800
There's no off on your switch,
is there, Walsh?

44:34.100 --> 44:35.700
lt'll be a great game.

44:35.900 --> 44:37.800
Nobody could have predicted this.

44:38.100 --> 44:39.700
Jordan, my man,

44:40.000 --> 44:42.400
anybody could have predicted this.
