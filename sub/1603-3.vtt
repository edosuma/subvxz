Three years.

BECKY:<i> I know you're sick.</i>

00:09.043 --> 00:10.642
There's no cure, I'm dying.

00:10.644 --> 00:13.145
You come to my house
and pull a gun on me?

00:13.147 --> 00:14.613
I want what's mine.
(gunshot)

00:14.615 --> 00:16.682
VERNON:
<i> They shot him in the face.</i>

00:16.684 --> 00:19.551
We gotta tell Cookie. No, that
was her closest cousin, man.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.553
You just want to have sex with
me now 'cause I'm a celebrity

00:21.555 --> 00:24.123

MAN:
Get in the car.

00:25.659 --> 00:28.193
We need you to testify
in front of a grand jury.

00:28.195 --> 00:31.730
You gonna get me killed. LUCIOUS:
<i> No matter</i> <i> what you do with Jamal,</i>

00:31.732 --> 00:33.966
he's never gonna be
as big as Hakeem.

00:33.968 --> 00:35.234
COOKIE:
<i> I want to show you a sissy</i>

00:35.236 --> 00:36.802

When you're about

01:50.411 --> 01:53.212
Wiz Khalifa performed
at the Webster Ballroom.

It's time to book a gig.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.415
No, you get back

Laviticus was dope and all,

Okay!

02:21.775 --> 02:23.909
Cut, cut! Let's reset.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.678
Reset. We'll try it again, everybody.
Where's my manager, Mel?

02:26.680 --> 02:29.148
Um, it's all gonna be okay.
You pushed me on purpose.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.083
DIRECTOR: No, she didn't, Veronica.
Whatever.

02:31.085 --> 02:32.017
It's all gonna be fine.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.018
We'll take a little break,

02:33.020 --> 02:34.286
we'll start again.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.687
I ain't happy
about this, Lucious.

02:36.523 --> 02:37.789
Veronica belongs out front,

02:37.791 --> 02:39.958
and you know it.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.593
And you are?

02:41.595 --> 02:42.694
Mel.

02:42.696 --> 02:43.962
Her manager.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.631
Oh, I know you.
You're that

02:45.633 --> 02:47.866
freeloading cousin
out of Atlanta.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.435
You know, I'm-a hold you to all
them promises you ain't kept

02:50.437 --> 02:52.037
when you signed her...

02:52.039 --> 02:53.939
or you gonna need
some more protection.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.174
Yo, watch
how you talkin', homey.

02:55.176 --> 02:57.609
No, no, no, relax.

02:57.611 --> 03:01.380
Well, actually, uh, Veronica
and I are gonna have a...

03:01.382 --> 03:03.482
discussion later on
this afternoon.

03:03.484 --> 03:06.351
Yeah. I'm-a be there.

03:06.353 --> 03:09.121
We can have this discussion
right now, if you'd like.

03:09.123 --> 03:10.522
Right in my trailer.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.790
Let's talk.

03:15.895 --> 03:17.996
I'm sorry if you've had
any type of confusion

03:17.998 --> 03:19.698
with what we were
supposed to do, right?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.466
We're gonna handle it.
Yeah, absolutely.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.402
Let's talk. Can I have
this for a second, babe?

03:23.404 --> 03:24.703
Sure.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.972
I don't want
to be disturbed.

03:30.476 --> 03:31.910
(muffled): Now, what the...
(thumping)

03:31.912 --> 03:33.312
(Mel grunting)
LUCIOUS: What'd you say?

03:33.314 --> 03:34.680
Protection.
Now who needs protection?

03:34.682 --> 03:36.582
(thud, groaning)
Huh, huh?

03:41.254 --> 03:42.521
Mel had a little accident.

03:42.523 --> 03:43.889
You might need
to clean that up.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.557
Yes, sir.
And tell Veronica

03:45.559 --> 03:48.493
her ex-manager won't be
joining us for the meeting.

03:48.495 --> 03:50.095
Cookie, what are you doing?

03:50.097 --> 03:51.997
Nothing.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.765
Why you blocking me?

03:53.767 --> 03:55.901
'Cause this is Anika's shoot
and I'm not letting you

03:55.903 --> 03:59.938
mess this up. Come on. Ain't nobody
trying to go in there, anyway.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.341
I came down here
to talk to you.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.076
I'm here.

04:04.078 --> 04:07.112
You ain't got nothing to tell me
about Bunkie's funeral?

04:07.114 --> 04:08.747
I've been calling you.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.515
Look, I'm handling that, okay?

04:10.517 --> 04:13.552
Oh... okay.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.554
Well, can you share?

04:15.556 --> 04:17.623
He was my cousin, Lucious.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.591
Look, I got something really
special planned for Bunkie.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.760
But right now, I gotta
get back to work.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.262
You gotta trust me.

04:23.264 --> 04:26.965
Let me go in...
No, I'm-I'm working, Cookie.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.634
Get off of me.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.270
Better be glad I don't
feel like no scene today,

04:31.272 --> 04:34.039
'cause I'd shut it down.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.841
You look nice.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.551
And once you've made
your selection, E.W. Green

04:46.553 --> 04:48.153
will take care of getting
all the floral tributes

04:48.155 --> 04:49.254
from the church
to the cemetery.

04:49.256 --> 04:51.657
Hey, Becky, um,

04:51.659 --> 04:53.258
we heard back from Gladys

04:53.260 --> 04:54.826
concerning Bunkie's funeral?

04:54.828 --> 04:56.295
Yes, sir, Gladys Knight is in.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.930
Sorry to
interrupt, Dad.

04:58.932 --> 05:01.199
I wanted you
to see this right away.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.508
MAN:
<i> This guy's intricacies</i>

05:09.510 --> 05:11.276
of rap are on a par
with Tupac's

05:11.278 --> 05:13.979
as far as street
and D-Boy lyrics.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.281
I think he's an ace of spades
that we should have...

05:16.283 --> 05:19.184
Who in here
was aware that

05:19.186 --> 05:21.586
Kidd Fo-Fo signed
with Creedmoor?

05:21.588 --> 05:24.256
Well, I hadn't heard, but
I don't see what the problem is,

05:24.258 --> 05:26.358
since we're the ones
that dropped him.

05:28.494 --> 05:29.795
The problem is,

05:29.797 --> 05:32.130
Beretti's
controlling the story.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.300
And that article makes it look
like he was poached from me.

05:35.302 --> 05:38.470
And I want to hit him back.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.872
Mo-Mo-Most of Creedmoor's
biggest stars

05:40.874 --> 05:43.942
are in EDM, and Empire
doesn't really do EDM.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.644
Billy Beretti
tried to ruin me.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.112
He is my enemy.

05:47.114 --> 05:50.115
Go after him.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.717
I want to know
who the hairy

05:51.719 --> 05:53.151
dingleberry had dinner

05:53.153 --> 05:54.720
with last night,
what parties

05:54.722 --> 05:56.488
he went to,
who he's trying

05:56.490 --> 05:58.023
to sign.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.359
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

06:00.361 --> 06:03.061
(whispers): There's a
detective waiting for you

06:03.063 --> 06:04.329
in your office.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.764
It's about Bunkie.

06:09.001 --> 06:11.236
So sorry to keep you
waiting, Detective.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.572
Not a problem. You
want anything to drink?

06:13.574 --> 06:16.675
No, thank you.
Thank you.

06:16.677 --> 06:19.745
Sorry to interrupt you
in your office, Mr. Lyon.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.814
It's all right.
I'm your biggest fan, though.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.249
I appreciate that.
All right.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.651
Have a seat, Detective.
Oh, thank you.

06:26.653 --> 06:31.223
Y'all got any leads
on who killed my friend?

06:31.225 --> 06:34.159
As a matter of fact, we had our
first break early this morning.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.561
A man checked into
the Bowery Mission

06:36.563 --> 06:39.097
late last night, and...

06:39.099 --> 06:41.466
he claimed that
he witnessed the murder.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.736
Wow-- saw it
with his own eyes?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.772
We believe we have
an eyewitness.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.174
That's... that's great news.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.843
(chuckles)
Yeah, wow.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.912
ANDRE:
<i> So, Dad, you wanted to see me?</i>

06:53.914 --> 06:56.748
You still got your contact
down at city hall?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.583
Yeah, why?

06:58.585 --> 07:01.119
Well, the police think they got
a witness for Bunkie's murder.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.221
I don't trust those clowns
not to screw it up,

07:03.223 --> 07:06.291
so I want to find out who it is,
so when the DA decides

07:06.293 --> 07:09.928
not to pursue it, I can make
sure that justice gets served.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.463
Can you get on that?

07:11.465 --> 07:13.799
Yes, sir.

(deep sigh)

07:47.267 --> 07:49.234
Andre, did you
hear that mess?

07:49.236 --> 07:51.436
Back in the day,
there were songwriters

07:51.438 --> 07:53.138
who actually knew
how to write songs.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.174
You should talk
to the Jorgensons.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.009
They're out
by the conference room.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.111
Porsha.

08:00.113 --> 08:03.081
Get your notebook.
Follow me.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.584
I know, I will handle
the Gaga deal,

08:05.586 --> 08:07.419
you handle the Usher.

08:07.421 --> 08:08.920
You gotta be
kidding me--

08:08.922 --> 08:11.122
those two white boys
are the Jorgensons?

08:11.124 --> 08:12.457
ANDRE:
Those two white boys charted

08:12.459 --> 08:14.759
four number-one
hits last year.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.495
Really?

08:17.263 --> 08:19.698
Hi. I'm Cookie Lyon.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.433
I founded the company.

08:21.435 --> 08:23.869
I need you to write a song
for my son, Jamal Lyon.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.871
He's one of our most
promising new artists.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.206
Found it?
I believe it means originated.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.609
Mm-hmm.
I do not know company Jamal?

08:30.611 --> 08:32.277
No, no, no, no. I founded...
ANIKA: Hans,

08:32.279 --> 08:33.645
Bjorn. (laughs)

08:33.647 --> 08:35.714
Hey!
Morning, Anika!

08:35.716 --> 08:37.682
Oh, I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.150
Oh, no, no.
No, no, no.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.753
Oh... (speaks Norwegian)

08:50.963 --> 08:54.032
(imitates Norwegian)
I'll talk to y'all later, okay?

08:54.034 --> 08:56.568
(quietly):
Bitch.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.136
Why are you auditioning
songwriters, Mom?

08:58.138 --> 09:00.071
I didn't know I wasn't
supposed to tell him.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.307
Sorry. You wasn't<i> wasn't
</i> supposed to tell him.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.809
Look, Jamal, I listened to your
stuff, and you're good, baby,

09:04.811 --> 09:06.578
but you don't have
that breakout hit, okay?

09:06.580 --> 09:09.247
And you bitched out
on me after you told me

09:09.249 --> 09:12.083
you was gonna come out in public, so...
Just step off, all right?

09:12.085 --> 09:15.153
Your brother Hakeem blew
up after Laviticus. Okay.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.522
Now there is only one thing
that can compete with that,

09:17.524 --> 09:19.591
and that is a num...
A song that's a hit.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.026
She my manager now, too?

09:21.028 --> 09:22.093
Porsha, please sit down.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.595
Give us some space.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.597
Every artist

09:25.599 --> 09:27.566
from Michael Jackson to Usher

09:27.568 --> 09:29.167

09:29.169 --> 09:30.368
Even your father.

09:30.370 --> 09:34.072
Ma, I write my own stuff.
Period.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.374
Okay, look, I know I've been
out of the game for a while,

09:36.376 --> 09:38.443
but I still got my instinct.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.445
And you got to trust me.

09:40.447 --> 09:43.348
Hakeem is good, but you
are more talented...

09:43.350 --> 09:45.584
Why don't you stop pitting me
against him? He is my brother...

09:45.586 --> 09:48.286
I will talk about him
any way I want.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.357
Total shares of common stock
private offering is gonna be

09:52.359 --> 09:54.292
thirty...
Lucious, we got to talk.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.731
What is this?

09:59.733 --> 10:01.399
This is Gus. He's a private
detective that I hired.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.767
You did what?!

10:02.769 --> 10:04.369
He ain't cheating on you.

10:04.371 --> 10:08.306
I hired him to follow
Cookie, fool.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.643
Baby, I...

10:11.645 --> 10:13.411
I don't trust her.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.213
She's mad at you,
and I had a feeling

10:15.215 --> 10:16.881
she was gonna
do something to hurt you.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.483
And?

10:18.485 --> 10:19.784
These were taken
last Friday night,

10:19.786 --> 10:21.152
right outside
Laviticus.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.887
What is this?

10:25.057 --> 10:26.491
All right, well, who...

10:26.493 --> 10:27.959
who are these people
she's talking to?

10:27.961 --> 10:29.427
Well, I ran the plates,

10:29.429 --> 10:31.162
nothing came up,
so I got no proof,

10:31.164 --> 10:32.897
but I do got a lot
of experience in this

10:32.899 --> 10:35.834
sort of thing, and I would
bet my bottom dollar

10:35.836 --> 10:37.502
that those two are Feds.

10:43.175 --> 10:46.845
What happened
to you, cousin?

10:50.082 --> 10:51.683
(cries quietly)

10:51.685 --> 10:54.686
I thought I might find you here.

10:59.025 --> 11:01.292
If it wasn't
for Bunkie,

11:01.294 --> 11:03.995
none of us would've
made it out of here.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.665
He was loyal.

11:08.634 --> 11:12.270
I wish I could say
the same thing about you.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.939
(sniffles)
What?

11:16.809 --> 11:19.210
Who have you been
meeting with, Cook?

11:19.212 --> 11:22.147
Did you snitch on me so you
could get out of jail early?

11:22.149 --> 11:26.885
If I snitched on you, Lucious,
would you be standing here?

11:26.887 --> 11:30.021
You can play country dumb
with anyone but me.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.356
Now, a week ago,

11:31.358 --> 11:32.824
you walked
into my office

11:32.826 --> 11:34.693
and said you were gonna
go to the SEC  (sighs)

11:34.695 --> 11:37.662
and tell them that Empire
was started with drug money.

11:37.664 --> 11:40.131
You're the mother
of my children.

11:40.133 --> 11:44.436
Regardless of what has happened
between us, Cookie, I love you.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.806
But if anybody gets
in the way of my plans

11:47.808 --> 11:51.209
for my company or my family,

11:51.211 --> 11:53.211
I see as an enemy,
This is my family, too,

11:53.213 --> 11:55.380
and I stop at nothing
Lucious, and my company.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.716
to destroy my enemies.
It's my company, too.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.988
(indistinct chatter)

12:03.990 --> 12:05.657
COOKIE:
<i> I got a bone to pick with you.</i>

12:05.659 --> 12:08.159
Pick 'em.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.028
'Cause I got bones, too.

12:10.030 --> 12:13.398
Did you tell Lucious about
the deal I have with the Feds?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.899
Look, I ain't told nobody
nothing.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.000
Shh... Look, I
ain't seen Lucious

12:16.002 --> 12:17.736
in years.
Yeah, well,

12:17.738 --> 12:20.205
he knows something,
and you're the only one I told.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.539
You're
my big sister.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.441
I swear on my kids,
okay, Cookie?

12:23.443 --> 12:25.477
I ain't told nobody nothing.

12:27.279 --> 12:30.949
Oh, my God, is that...
is that Ronny Brown?

12:30.951 --> 12:32.584
Damn!

12:32.586 --> 12:33.718
He had a hit record

12:33.720 --> 12:35.086
when I went away.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.756
Man, it all went to hell
when Puma bailed.

12:37.758 --> 12:40.892
Mmm. Puma wrote
all his hits.

12:40.894 --> 12:43.862
Puma...

12:43.864 --> 12:47.298
You know, that's not
a bad idea for Jamal.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.800
You got Puma's number?

12:48.802 --> 12:50.769
Mm-mm. No, I told you,
he up and disappeared.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.137
Yeah, well, I
need his number.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.972
(crowd cheering)
Work on that, Carol.

12:55.641 --> 12:58.276
(cheering, whooping, applause)

13:06.252 --> 13:08.219
What are you crying about?

13:08.221 --> 13:10.889
His daddy would always rap him
your songs.

13:12.391 --> 13:15.293
My daddy died
when I was little like you.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.395
Not too far from here.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.031
But, you know, men don't cry.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.067
You want to be a rapper
when you grow up?

Well, it is nice to see you
again, Deputy Mayor Alvarez.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.589
You're looking lovely.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.992
And you're very charming, as
always, Mr. Lyon. Are you here

16:00.994 --> 16:03.761
to discuss the mayor's
music educational program?

16:03.763 --> 16:08.066

Mmm.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.445
Walker...

16:20.447 --> 16:25.083
investigating the murder of
my father's business associate.

16:26.185 --> 16:27.585
I need to know
who his key witness is.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.254
Of course, Mr. Lyon.
Yeah.

16:30.256 --> 16:33.191
The city would love
to help you.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.662

Wow. Doctor said I wouldn't have

16:43.103 --> 16:46.971
This is funny.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.940
Babe, you've got
to see this.

16:48.942 --> 16:51.809
This is so cute.
(chuckles)

16:51.811 --> 16:54.312
(grunts)
You okay?

16:54.314 --> 16:56.714
Yeah. My leg went to sleep.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.983
Oh. It's 'cause you've been
standing on it all day.

16:58.985 --> 17:00.351
You know, I think I know why

17:00.353 --> 17:02.053
Beretti's coming
after me so hard.

17:02.055 --> 17:04.789
Why?
He's trying to sink this IPO.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.991
Baby, relax.

17:06.993 --> 17:10.194
You got to focus
on all the positive, okay?

17:10.196 --> 17:13.398
Like the fact that we have
the number two, three,

17:13.400 --> 17:15.833
and five albums in the country.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.636

And Hakeem's single

17:18.638 --> 17:21.339

Ooh! Look at this.

This is them at SPiN.
That was a couple days ago.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.347
She's gonna do well
for Empire.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.982
You know what I want to do?
What?

17:30.984 --> 17:32.984
I want to keep them
together.

17:32.986 --> 17:35.686
Let's throw a little
get-together this weekend

17:35.688 --> 17:37.588
here at the house.
Really?

17:37.590 --> 17:39.557
Like a little dinner.
Yeah?

17:39.559 --> 17:41.059
Mm-hmm.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.860
I think I'd like that.

17:42.862 --> 17:45.930
You know what I would like?
What?

17:45.932 --> 17:48.499
I would like...

17:48.501 --> 17:51.702
the number...

17:51.704 --> 17:56.441

17:56.443 --> 17:59.277
I think we can work on that.
Mmm.

18:04.183 --> 18:05.783
Found him here this morning.
His name is--

18:05.785 --> 18:08.453
and I'm not kidding here--
Ol' Salty.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.556
(scoffs) Good luck getting
anything intelligible out of him.

18:11.558 --> 18:12.990
All right.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.433
How you doing, Ol' Salty?

18:22.435 --> 18:24.535
I'm drinkin'
my liquor, sir.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.471
We understand
you witnessed a murder.

18:26.473 --> 18:31.109
Woe to them that are
mighty men of strength

18:31.111 --> 18:34.212
to mingle with
strong drink.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.914
Nothing he says
will be admissible.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.483
This is
a waste of time.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.451
All right.

to tell me, old man?

18:55.934 --> 18:58.803
Yeah, good luck with that.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.077
All right.

19:06.079 --> 19:08.613
You know what,

Yeah.

He was hired by Anika Calhoun.

22:05.692 --> 22:09.260
We took care of Berger.
It's your ex.

22:09.262 --> 22:11.028
Lucious can't
know we're FBI.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.998
We spent five years building
this case against Frank Gathers.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.101
We won't have it compromised
by your nosy ex-husband.

22:17.103 --> 22:19.503
So we gotta come up
with something, but fast.

22:19.505 --> 22:22.006
We can't have anybody knowing
what we're doing.

22:22.008 --> 22:26.010
Okay, but I'm gonna need y'all
to help me find somebody.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.346
Cookie, we are the FBI.

22:28.348 --> 22:31.649
It is not like you scratch
our back, we scratch your back.

22:31.651 --> 22:34.151
I need you to help me find
an old friend, okay?

22:34.153 --> 22:35.720
His name is Puma.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.154
All right. All right.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.556
Shut up. Get out of here.

22:38.558 --> 22:41.058
Thank you.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.963
COOKIE: Yeah, I was loaded.
Yeah.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.699
So this is
the last time, Cookie.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.135
Yeah. You fail
another alcohol test,

22:51.137 --> 22:52.636
and I'm hauling your tushy
right back in.

22:52.638 --> 22:54.004
Oh, please do,

22:54.006 --> 22:55.973
and in honor of this
wonderful occasion,

22:55.975 --> 22:57.742
let me buy the first drink.
(scoffs)

22:57.744 --> 22:59.877
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Mmm.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.179
This is Officer Judy Carter,
my...

23:02.181 --> 23:05.516
Your parole officer. I know.
Oh. Nice to meet you, Mr. Lyon.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.184
Pleasure. Listen, I have
to tell you, the reason

23:07.186 --> 23:09.019
why I asked for this meeting
here today was, uh,

23:09.021 --> 23:11.422
so I can get your autograph
for my kid.

23:11.424 --> 23:14.158
I hope you don't mind.
No, not at all.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.826
I mean, if it means
you're gonna lock her back up...

23:15.828 --> 23:17.395
I was wondering why
you all were meeting

23:17.397 --> 23:18.996
in my conference room.
Yeah, well, if she skips

23:18.998 --> 23:20.898
another check-in
or fails another alcohol test,

23:20.900 --> 23:23.100
that's exactly
what's gonna happen to her.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.102
Hey, could you
make it out to Sebastian?

23:25.104 --> 23:26.937
Yes. I have my own.
Oh, sure.

23:26.939 --> 23:29.073
Is there a bathroom around here?
Yeah.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.708
Straight down the hall
to the right.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.576
Then jump out the window.
It's straight down.

23:32.578 --> 23:33.944
It's down the hall

23:33.946 --> 23:35.045
to the right.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.647
Thanks.

23:42.053 --> 23:43.621
You know, she reminds me

23:43.623 --> 23:46.524
of the probation officer
I had, back in the day.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.259
Um...

23:48.261 --> 23:51.395
Rosenberg... baum...
stein, whatever.

23:51.397 --> 23:53.798
Couldn't stand that bitch.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.733
(sighs)

23:55.735 --> 24:00.204
Look, I'm sorry about the attack
at... Bunkie's funeral.

24:00.206 --> 24:01.906
I was just really upset.

24:01.908 --> 24:05.176
Yeah, I was upset, too, but
I didn't take it out on you.

24:06.978 --> 24:08.712
Well, let me
make it up to you.

24:08.714 --> 24:10.147
(scoffs)

24:10.149 --> 24:11.982
I'm inviting the family
over to my house tomorrow

24:11.984 --> 24:13.951
to welcome Tiana,
Hakeem's new girlfriend,

24:13.953 --> 24:15.319
(scoffs)
into the family.

24:15.321 --> 24:18.756
So my sons are invited,
but I'm not.

24:18.758 --> 24:21.926
I'm inviting you now.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.761
Come on, you gonna
come or not?

COOKIE: (sighs)
Okay, Lucious.

24:25.598 --> 24:27.565
Nice meeting you,
Officer Carter.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.600
Nice meeting you, Mr. Lyon. And,
mind you, I'll be the first one

24:29.602 --> 24:30.734
to let you know
Oh...

24:30.736 --> 24:32.136
if she does anything wrong.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.571
(laughs)
Well, thanks for this.

24:33.573 --> 24:34.972
My kid will
cherish it.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.807
I will cherish you
locking her back up.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.509
Yeah.

24:40.779 --> 24:42.847
All right,
Dwayne Robinson,

24:42.849 --> 24:44.815
aka Puma.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.984
Want to know
where to find him?

24:54.125 --> 24:55.826
MAN (in distance):
Get a firm grip on the reign.

24:55.828 --> 24:56.961
Never stand right
in front of them,

24:56.963 --> 24:58.429
'cause they will
step on you.

24:58.431 --> 25:00.498
Big animals,
but you know...

25:00.500 --> 25:02.199
Cookie?!

25:03.001 --> 25:04.602
Puma?

25:04.604 --> 25:06.504
Cookie?!

25:06.506 --> 25:08.506
Wait... oh, wait!
Don't step in the poo.

25:08.508 --> 25:11.342
(both laughing)

25:12.878 --> 25:15.379
Everyone calls me
Dwayne now.

25:15.381 --> 25:17.348
Nicely done, fellas.

25:17.350 --> 25:20.050
I don't go by Puma
much anymore.

25:22.053 --> 25:23.787
Please, have a seat.

25:23.789 --> 25:26.624
Wow, you've really done
good for yourself.

25:30.061 --> 25:31.896
Damn, you look
good, woman.

25:31.898 --> 25:35.299
What have you been doing,
bathing in buttermilk baths?

25:35.301 --> 25:37.401
Your skin is so
smooth and soft

25:37.403 --> 25:39.670
and stuff...

25:39.672 --> 25:41.171
You are still the charmer.

25:41.173 --> 25:44.241
Yeah... it never really
worked with you, though.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.313
Um... I think,
I think I should go.

25:49.315 --> 25:50.848
No, no, no, no, wait.

25:50.850 --> 25:51.882
(laughs quietly)

25:51.884 --> 25:53.551
You didn't come
all this way

25:53.553 --> 25:56.320
just to turn me down again,
after 20 years, did you?

25:57.722 --> 25:59.490
Nah, um...

25:59.492 --> 26:03.494
I came because you are still
the best songwriter I ever knew.

26:03.496 --> 26:07.031
I wanted to see
if I could get a song from you.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.899
Ah.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.502
(chuckles)
Well...

26:11.504 --> 26:13.504
I'm not in the game
anymore, Cookie.

26:13.506 --> 26:18.242
Besides, I'm not feeling exactly
generous towards Lucious.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.743
Oh, no, no,
it's not for Lucious,

26:19.745 --> 26:20.844
it's for my son Jamal.

26:20.846 --> 26:23.247
Puma, he is dope.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.716
I mean, he is just
as talented as Lucious.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.618
But... with a heart.

26:27.620 --> 26:28.852
(both laugh)

26:28.854 --> 26:30.921
I wish I could
help you, Cookie.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.790
I really do.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.858
But everything I do
now is just trying

26:34.860 --> 26:36.527
to save these kids
you see out here

26:36.529 --> 26:39.029
from getting in the
same mess we did.

26:39.031 --> 26:41.098
You know?

26:42.801 --> 26:45.936
Lucious is a son of a bitch
for having you go down for him.

26:51.910 --> 26:54.945
If you were my lady,
you'd never have to do that.

26:58.817 --> 27:00.217
Cookie, wait.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.455
I'm gonna send
you a song.

27:04.457 --> 27:06.390
I think it'll work
for your son.

27:06.392 --> 27:09.493
Hell, I think
you'll remember it.

but the, um...

27:42.461 --> 27:44.528
lyrics suck.

27:44.530 --> 27:47.364
Lucious, the song is about a man

(whooping)

34:10.883 --> 34:12.182
Wow!  HAKEEM:  Hey..

34:12.184 --> 34:14.051
LUCIOUS:
Wow!

34:14.053 --> 34:15.685
HAKEEM: Did you just
make that, though?

34:15.687 --> 34:17.721
LUCIOUS: Bravo, that was nice.
ANIKA: It was.

34:17.723 --> 34:20.557
So you went to see... Puma.

34:20.559 --> 34:21.892
Yes.

34:21.894 --> 34:23.427
Does he still like you?

34:23.429 --> 34:24.694
That's none of your business.

34:24.696 --> 34:26.163
But I'll tell you
what is my business:

34:26.165 --> 34:27.831
That song.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.666
That song...

34:29.668 --> 34:33.603
I had never really liked it
until I heard

34:33.605 --> 34:35.372
your version of it.

34:35.374 --> 34:37.741
I mean, now I think that John
Legend would kill that song...

34:37.743 --> 34:39.042
COOKIE:
Lucious!

34:39.044 --> 34:40.644
...on his new album.

34:41.712 --> 34:43.513
I own the song.

34:44.348 --> 34:45.882
I bought it from Puma,

34:45.884 --> 34:47.284
but I never saw
its true potential

34:47.286 --> 34:48.552
until this moment, right here.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.053
I think, son,

34:50.055 --> 34:51.221
you've got a great career

34:51.223 --> 34:53.423
as an arranger.
(sighs)

34:53.425 --> 34:55.125
What has this money done to you?

34:55.127 --> 34:56.626
We need to...
What has happened to you?

34:56.628 --> 34:58.562
Ma. Ma. Ma. Ma...

34:58.564 --> 35:00.897
I complimented it--
I said I liked the song.

35:00.899 --> 35:02.265
Ma...

35:02.267 --> 35:04.267
You know that ain't worth it.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.103
Come on.

35:06.105 --> 35:07.370
I...

35:07.372 --> 35:09.039
You mean you wanted
to do the song?

35:09.041 --> 35:11.208
You could keep the song, man.

35:11.210 --> 35:13.110
I ain't want the song
anyway, right?

35:13.112 --> 35:14.444
LUCIOUS: I'm sorry.
I didn't know you

35:14.446 --> 35:16.646
wanted the song;
I didn't know that.

35:16.648 --> 35:19.149
She told me, back in the day,
that you couldn't

35:19.151 --> 35:20.550
make the song work.

35:20.552 --> 35:22.219
LUCIOUS:
Hmm?

35:22.221 --> 35:23.653
Tell me, how does
it feel that

35:23.655 --> 35:25.155
your little girl could do

35:25.157 --> 35:26.423
something that you couldn't?

35:26.425 --> 35:28.725
You washed up.

35:28.727 --> 35:31.228
And the songs that I'm writing
will only further prove

35:31.230 --> 35:32.996
that I'm you, but on steroids.

35:32.998 --> 35:35.332
Baby... Come on,
Jamal, don't leave.

35:35.334 --> 35:36.800
I'm leavin'.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.001
No, no, no, let him go.

35:38.003 --> 35:39.402
I mean, this night
is to celebrate

35:39.404 --> 35:40.637
a man and his woman,

35:40.639 --> 35:43.306
not some sensitive punk
and his bitch.

35:43.308 --> 35:44.674
You are going straight to Hell.

35:44.676 --> 35:46.143
(door closes)

35:51.315 --> 35:53.583
(sighs heavily)

35:53.585 --> 35:55.051
Jamal's song was hot,
wasn't it?

35:57.255 --> 35:59.156
It was good. Yeah.

35:59.158 --> 36:01.525
Look, Hakeem,

36:01.527 --> 36:03.326
you are a made man.

36:03.328 --> 36:05.128
Dad's boy.

36:05.130 --> 36:07.531
So it doesn't matter whether
you're as talented as Jamal.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.533
Dad's gonna pick you,
no matter what.

36:09.535 --> 36:10.967
What did you just say to me?

36:10.969 --> 36:12.869
I said Dad's gonna pick you,
no matter what.

36:12.871 --> 36:14.971
I'm not Dad's boy.
(chuckles)

36:14.973 --> 36:16.840
I'm my own man.
Okay.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.141
And if I'm his favorite,
maybe it's because

36:18.143 --> 36:19.142
I'm the most talented.

36:19.144 --> 36:21.678
You the most
talented?

36:21.680 --> 36:23.780
You know, I think you'd
do a real good backup

36:23.782 --> 36:25.949
for "Up All Night." That sounds
nice, right? You know what, man?

36:25.951 --> 36:27.150
I can't even... You
know, brothers...

36:27.152 --> 36:28.785
the brothers
getting together...

36:28.787 --> 36:30.187
You know I'm just messing
with you, Mr. Insecurity.

36:30.189 --> 36:31.421
Hakeem...

36:34.225 --> 36:35.559
Mmm, bubu kitty.

36:35.561 --> 36:37.827
Just 'cause I asked
Jesus to forgive you

36:37.829 --> 36:39.196
don't mean I do.

36:39.198 --> 36:41.131
You need to watch your back.

36:41.133 --> 36:43.633
Cookie, my father is a doctor.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.336
And my mother was a
debutante, and so was I.

36:46.338 --> 36:47.871
Now, I know you been
in jail for a minute,

36:47.873 --> 36:49.539
but do you even know
what a debutante is?

36:49.541 --> 36:52.342
Hmm...

36:52.344 --> 36:54.144
A boozy ho with a lot of money.

36:54.146 --> 36:56.479
A ho who can slice your throat

36:56.481 --> 36:58.215
without even disturbing
her pearls.

36:58.217 --> 37:00.150
Oh...

37:00.152 --> 37:01.985
Damn, that made me hot.

37:01.987 --> 37:03.954
I aim to please.

37:16.701 --> 37:18.134
What's that?

37:21.239 --> 37:22.505
Nothin'.

37:22.507 --> 37:25.075
Just a little
hypertension.

37:25.077 --> 37:26.910
I thought you left.

37:26.912 --> 37:31.014
I watched you
while Jamal played tonight.

37:31.016 --> 37:33.116
You're afraid of him,
aren't you?

37:33.118 --> 37:34.918
I'm not afraid of nothing.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.187
Yeah, you are.

37:37.189 --> 37:40.023
You're afraid,
because he's a true artist,

37:40.025 --> 37:42.425
and you can't deny it anymore.

37:44.262 --> 37:48.732
Something's got you
shook, Lucious.

37:48.734 --> 37:50.433
Like it's chasing you

37:50.435 --> 37:52.936
and you don't want it
to catch you.

37:52.938 --> 37:57.107
Now, I don't know if it has
anything to do with Jamal,

37:57.109 --> 38:00.076
but whatever it is,
you're trying to hide it.

38:00.078 --> 38:03.213
But you know
you can't hide from me.

38:04.782 --> 38:08.485
(whispering): You can't hide
from me, Lucious.

38:08.487 --> 38:09.786
Baby.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.288
Hm.

38:19.063 --> 38:21.665
(soft kissing sounds)

38:33.844 --> 38:36.313
You think Jamal
more talented than me?

38:36.315 --> 38:38.148
Who cares?

38:38.150 --> 38:39.916
You're the one.

38:39.918 --> 38:42.085
You are going
to inherit the kingdom.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.987
Why does everyone say that?

38:43.989 --> 38:45.922
Like the only reason
I'm where I am

38:45.924 --> 38:47.791
is 'cause my father
cut checks for me?

38:47.793 --> 38:50.327
You know I killed it
at Laviticus last week.

38:50.329 --> 38:51.661
That was me.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.630
Nobody else did that.

38:53.632 --> 38:55.598
I read about it.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.201
Unfortunately, I wasn't invited.

38:58.203 --> 39:00.403
You know why I gotta
keep us on the low.

39:01.706 --> 39:04.007
But you're everything to me.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.275
Right? You know that.

39:05.277 --> 39:07.277
I'm not sure I do, my darling.

39:07.279 --> 39:10.480
I mean... we've been seeing
each other for over a year.

39:10.482 --> 39:12.982
Tell me...

39:12.984 --> 39:15.385
tell me, who am I to you?

39:15.387 --> 39:16.653
You're my mama.

39:16.655 --> 39:17.887
Tell me again.

39:17.889 --> 39:19.155
Who am I to you?

39:19.157 --> 39:20.590
My mama.

39:21.859 --> 39:23.727
MICHAEL:
<i> Just let it go.</i>

39:23.729 --> 39:25.495
I can't let it go.

39:25.497 --> 39:28.131
The more I play it,
the more I want to win.

39:29.133 --> 39:31.701
(phone ringing)

39:35.673 --> 39:37.474
Hello?

39:40.077 --> 39:41.578
Right now?

39:45.750 --> 39:47.851
My dad's downstairs.
He's coming up, right now.

39:47.853 --> 39:50.153
What?!

40:03.100 --> 40:05.268
JAMAL: Don't look back there.
It's the bedroom.

40:05.270 --> 40:06.870
It's where we make
the gay love.

40:06.872 --> 40:07.837
Enough.

40:07.839 --> 40:09.572
(door slams)

40:20.284 --> 40:22.519
Why are you here?

40:29.293 --> 40:31.494
I don't know.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.634
I wanted to see you.

40:37.636 --> 40:40.303
You saw me tonight.

40:41.572 --> 40:43.706
I sang a song for you.

40:43.708 --> 40:45.642
I arranged that
song for you

40:45.644 --> 40:47.243
because I love you

40:47.245 --> 40:50.146
and you spit
in my face.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.648
Spit in your face?

40:51.650 --> 40:53.082
I've tried to tell you

40:53.084 --> 40:54.317
since you were a baby

40:54.319 --> 40:56.219
that it's not about black eyes

40:56.221 --> 40:58.054
or bloody noses in this world,

40:58.056 --> 41:00.557
it's life or death,
and if you don't toughen up,

41:00.559 --> 41:03.726
these streets will
eat your ass alive.

41:03.728 --> 41:05.628
Since I was a baby,
you beat me.

41:05.630 --> 41:08.565
You told me that was
to "toughen me up."

41:08.567 --> 41:10.800
That was a lie.

41:12.570 --> 41:14.571
You beat me
because you hate me.

41:14.573 --> 41:15.939
And you always will,

41:15.941 --> 41:17.774
because I'm always
gonna be who I am.

41:17.776 --> 41:19.442
I don't hate you.

41:19.444 --> 41:20.977
I don't know you.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.645
I didn't bring any women

41:22.647 --> 41:25.949
into this world, and to see my
son become somebody's bitch?

41:25.951 --> 41:27.517
I don't understand you!

41:27.519 --> 41:30.587
You don't have to understand me.

41:32.189 --> 41:33.690
You don't have
to understand me

41:33.692 --> 41:35.258
or have anything to do with me.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.626
I'm a man.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.161
A<i> man.</i>

41:39.530 --> 41:42.198
So you can keep
that stupid-ass song

41:42.200 --> 41:43.833
and your money and...

41:43.835 --> 41:47.270
and whatever else that Lucious
Lyon thinks that he owns.

41:47.272 --> 41:50.406
My obedience is
no longer for sale.

42:03.821 --> 42:06.723
Nice speech, kid.

42:06.725 --> 42:08.324
Especially hearing it

42:08.326 --> 42:11.027
in the apartment
that I pay for.

42:19.303 --> 42:20.770
Michael.

42:22.473 --> 42:23.907
Yeah?

42:23.909 --> 42:25.775
Pack your bags.
We're getting out of here.

42:26.977 --> 42:27.911
You serious?

42:27.913 --> 42:30.380
Dead serious.

42:36.487 --> 42:38.821
We'll be out in 15 minutes.

42:38.823 --> 42:41.758
Jamal, why you gotta
be so dramatic?

42:41.760 --> 42:43.760
Look, I'll leave the keys
on the table for you;

42:43.762 --> 42:46.729
you'll probably need 'em
in the morning.

42:47.765 --> 42:50.667
I really won't.

42:52.169 --> 42:54.137
(quietly):
Yeah, you will.

42:57.841 --> 42:59.175
Where are we gonna go?

42:59.177 --> 43:00.944
I don't know,
we'll figure it out.

43:00.946 --> 43:03.279
You sure you want to give
everything up?

43:03.281 --> 43:04.781
Hey!

43:05.783 --> 43:08.651
JAMAL:
I'm not giving up anything.

43:09.887 --> 43:12.121
I'm going after his Empire.

43:13.257 --> 43:15.592
I'm gonna take it.
