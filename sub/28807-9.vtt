15:46.779 --> 15:48.280
My dad just called to check in.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.033
I think maybe he went outside.
He wasn't feeling well.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.577
Let's split up. I'll look inside
and you two look out here.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.162
Okay. He's in a blue jacket.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.455
We're gonna find him.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.290
It's gonna be okay.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.335
["Outshine" playing]

16:11.971 --> 16:13.138
Spencer!

16:15.641 --> 16:16.809
Spencer!

16:20.813 --> 16:21.855
Spencer?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.126
Spencer.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.546
Spencer?

16:47.047 --> 16:48.215
[Spencer] Hello?

16:50.134 --> 16:51.260
Spencer!

16:52.094 --> 16:53.178
Are you in there?

16:53.554 --> 16:55.139
[Spencer] Can anyone hear me?

16:56.807 --> 16:58.851
-Spencer?
-[Spencer] Hello?

17:02.813 --> 17:03.731
I think he's in there.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.487
-Spencer?
-Spencer!

17:10.571 --> 17:12.072
-[Spencer] Elodie?
-Spencer!

17:13.365 --> 17:14.450
Spencer!

17:14.783 --> 17:16.452
-[Spencer] Elodie!
-Spencer?

17:16.869 --> 17:18.537
-Are you in there?
-[Spencer] Elodie?

17:18.954 --> 17:20.706
Hey, are you okay?

17:21.081 --> 17:22.374
[Spencer] I'm stuck!

17:23.208 --> 17:24.293
Hold on.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.132
[Spencer] Over here.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.428
I can't get my seatbelt...

17:34.928 --> 17:37.347
-Damn buckle.
-Hey, bud. Hey.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.683
I can't get out.

17:40.684 --> 17:41.810
Okay.

17:42.936 --> 17:43.771
[Elodie grunts]

17:46.023 --> 17:47.357
Hey, it's okay.

17:47.858 --> 17:48.984
You're okay.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.625
-What's wrong, sweetie?
-Mom, I was so scared.

18:05.417 --> 18:08.504
-I was lost.
-Wait. What? You-- You lost him?

18:08.587 --> 18:11.215
I mean, just for a second.
He wandered off.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.552
You were supposed to be watching him.
What the hell is wrong with you?

18:16.345 --> 18:18.889
[sighs] There's something wrong with me.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.726
-Hey, no, that's not--
-I ruin everything.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.311
It's my fault.

18:24.770 --> 18:25.854
Even mom.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.232
What?

18:29.024 --> 18:33.070
Your mom was killed by drunk driver.
You had nothing to do with her accident.

18:35.572 --> 18:36.949
No, you don't get it.

18:37.366 --> 18:41.411
If I hadn't called her
to pick me up early from that party...

18:42.204 --> 18:43.831
that never would've happened.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.543
Elodie, is that what you really think?

18:51.004 --> 18:52.798
That was not your fault.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.716
Do you hear me?

18:57.636 --> 18:59.388
Every morning I wake up...

19:00.180 --> 19:01.890
and for a split second...

19:02.683 --> 19:03.851
I forget.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.981
-I just miss her so much.
-Come here.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.059
[knocking at door]

19:52.733 --> 19:54.568
-Hey.
-Sorry I'm late.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.486
It's okay, my mom is still out.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.200
Wow.

20:01.283 --> 20:04.161
When you said to meet at your house,
I wasn't expecting this.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.663
Well, it's my parents. It's not me.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.667
I feel stupid letting you go on and on
about my shitty little apartment,

20:10.751 --> 20:12.085
when this is where you live.

20:12.169 --> 20:15.339
No, your apartment's not shitty.
It's yours.

20:16.548 --> 20:17.883
That's all that matters.

20:20.677 --> 20:21.762
Come here.

20:21.845 --> 20:22.971
[laughs]

20:36.360 --> 20:38.278
[thunder crackling]

20:46.495 --> 20:47.496
Hey.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.833
I want to do the deposition.

20:53.293 --> 20:54.336
For Mom.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.340
Okay.

21:01.677 --> 21:02.844
That's all.

21:12.187 --> 21:14.356
[phone ringing]

21:17.234 --> 21:19.111
-Paula?
-Hey, Moe, are you free?

21:19.528 --> 21:21.154
Uh, yeah. Why, what's up?

21:21.238 --> 21:23.282
Can you get down to the restaurant?
It's an emergency.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.534
-What happened?
-Just get down here.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.881
[soft music playing  in background]

21:46.430 --> 21:48.265
What is all this?

21:50.559 --> 21:54.730
I hear the cherry blossoms in Seoul
are supposed to be pretty epic, and...

21:55.647 --> 21:57.691
I was wishing I get to see them with you.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.694
So... you get it.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.784
I don't want to make any excuses, okay?

22:08.785 --> 22:09.703
I'm sorry.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.209
All I want is you.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.840
Yeah, you say that...

22:22.716 --> 22:23.800
-but--
-I mean it.

22:25.635 --> 22:27.304
Yeah, but once you have me...

22:29.097 --> 22:30.849
maybe you won't want me anymore.

22:31.725 --> 22:32.976
Don't you see?

22:36.104 --> 22:37.230
I'm here.

22:38.565 --> 22:39.941
I'm not going anywhere.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.154
Like, you live at Paula's now?

22:44.988 --> 22:46.823
Yeah, if that's what it takes.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.118
I'll be missing you like crazy,

22:50.202 --> 22:52.454
but I'll be right here waiting for you
when you get back.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.250
[speaking Korean]

22:58.001 --> 23:00.170
-Excuse me?
-It means...

23:00.253 --> 23:02.964
"I maybe love you too." In Korean.

23:07.677 --> 23:08.762
Shit.

23:09.513 --> 23:10.555
You're good.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.274
[camera beeps]

23:22.484 --> 23:23.777
[woman] Do you solemnly swear

23:23.860 --> 23:27.197
to tell the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

23:27.572 --> 23:28.573
I do.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.534
Please, state your full name
for the record.

23:31.034 --> 23:32.494
Elodie Davis.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.788
And are you aware
why you're being deposed?

23:35.288 --> 23:36.331
Yes.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.708
Okay. Let's begin.

23:41.086 --> 23:44.798
[Spencer making racing noises]

23:49.469 --> 23:52.264
Red takes over the lead,
black is gaining fast.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.393
He hits the turn. He loses control.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.938
[Jenna] Spencer!
Come get washed up for dinner!
