WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.068
<i>Previously on</i> reign...
Was it your gift

00:03.070 --> 00:06.171
Or your medicine
that healed me?
I saved your life.

00:06.173 --> 00:08.273
Say you'll marry me,
or we're over.
I can't.

00:08.275 --> 00:10.476
We may have
a promising future.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.277
Then let's see
if we're good together.

00:12.279 --> 00:15.080
Louis was approached by
elizabeth's envoy.

00:15.082 --> 00:17.583
You knew about this? That
condÃ© was courting England?

00:17.585 --> 00:20.219
Because he felt he had no
other choice. I abandoned him.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.021
Francis: <i>Do you realize</i>
<i>that by helping condÃ© escape,</i>

00:22.023 --> 00:24.656
<i>Elizabeth could have</i>
<i>a foothold in France?</i>

00:24.658 --> 00:26.125
CondÃ©'s army is
loyal to him.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.127
If he becomes king
consort of England,

00:28.129 --> 00:31.497
We will essentially have
an enemy army on our soil.

00:31.499 --> 00:34.166
Mary, this is the most dangerous
thing you have ever done.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.068
Akers: Her majesty
elizabeth still rejoices

00:36.070 --> 00:37.770
In the idea of marrying you.

00:37.772 --> 00:39.738
And she's ready to give you
her backing, if you take

00:39.740 --> 00:40.739
<i>The throne of France.</i>

00:40.741 --> 00:42.674
King louis of France!

00:42.676 --> 00:45.477
(men cheering)

00:49.149 --> 00:52.251
These are the regions where
lord condÃ© has been sighted.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.086
We've searched them all,
but found nothing.

00:54.088 --> 00:56.155
It's been four weeks
since condÃ© was last seen.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.589
You mean since
you helped him escape.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.825
My point is that

00:59.827 --> 01:01.560
He might not be
in France anymore.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.063
Our spies in England and abroad

01:04.065 --> 01:06.765
Haven't heard so much
as a whisper from him.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.534
He's still here.

01:08.536 --> 01:09.735
There are reports
some of his men

01:09.737 --> 01:11.236
Were seen
in the bouconne forest.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.838
He could be
gathering his troops.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.740
I want that forest searched.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.275
Take whoever you need.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.846
(door opens, closes)

01:20.848 --> 01:24.116
You think condÃ©'s a threat. Why?

01:24.118 --> 01:26.585
He's lost everything, there's
a warrant out for his head.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.387
Exactly. If I were him,
I'd want revenge.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.222
Whatever you think of him,
he's not vindictive.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.224
Maybe not to you.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.193
But I'm the one
who signed his death warrant.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.428
What could he have to gain
from striking out against you?

01:36.430 --> 01:38.764
The throne.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.399
He's a prince of the blood.

01:40.401 --> 01:43.135
All that stands between
him and the crown is my head.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.703
My brothers are
too young to rule,

01:44.705 --> 01:47.739
And no lords would accept
catherine as regent.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.408
You think condÃ© is
planning a coup.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.143
It's a prime opportunity.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.278
He has the support of the
english queen, who would like

01:53.280 --> 01:56.148
Nothing more than
to plunge France into chaos.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.583
And he knows
that we're vulnerable,

01:57.585 --> 01:59.418
What with the bulk of troops
in scotland

01:59.420 --> 02:01.320
Fighting to protect your throne.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.821
If you truly believe
that we are under threat,

02:02.823 --> 02:03.822
Then recall the troops.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.290
My throne in scotland

02:05.292 --> 02:06.558
Is meaningless
if France falls.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.227
I have considered it,
believe me,

02:08.229 --> 02:09.895
But bringing them back
would take too long.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.464
And it would look like
we're folding on another front.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.233
Then appeal to one of
your closer allies.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.300
Your brother-in-law,
king philip of Spain.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.302
I have, already.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.238
King philip is willing
to send troops,

02:19.240 --> 02:21.240
But only when there is
a clear and imminent threat.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.909
Not just my fears and
conjecture about what

02:23.911 --> 02:27.346
My wife's former lover might do.

02:27.348 --> 02:30.215
I understand your anger at me,

02:30.217 --> 02:32.251
But if you could
just look past it,

02:32.253 --> 02:34.186
You would see how sorry I am.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.488
Save your apologies.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.324
Your words have no meaning
for me anymore.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.596
(door opens)

02:50.537 --> 02:52.204
You weren't going to leave

02:52.206 --> 02:54.773
Without saying good-bye,
were you?

02:54.775 --> 02:57.376
It seemed a shame
to wake you.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.545
Do you have to go?

02:59.547 --> 03:01.680
If you stay, I can
make it worth your while.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.448
Tempting as that is,

03:03.450 --> 03:05.918
I doubt the king
would understand.

03:07.954 --> 03:09.254
Francis is relying
on your services

03:09.256 --> 03:10.856
More and more every day.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.525
You keep this up, you could
become his lead general.

03:16.296 --> 03:19.364
(moans softly)

03:19.366 --> 03:20.666
What?

03:20.668 --> 03:22.668
You're so beautiful.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.803
And I want to have my way
with you without worrying

03:24.805 --> 03:26.405
Who might see us.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.839
I thought that
added to the allure.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.374
It did, at first.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.643
But in the few weeks
we've had together,

03:31.645 --> 03:34.213
I've come to care for you.

03:34.215 --> 03:36.848
I see the life
I could have with you.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.350
Then I remember...

03:38.352 --> 03:40.953
You're married.
Well, that could change.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.789
Leave it to me.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.357
Once you return
victorious,

03:45.359 --> 03:47.359
Perhaps we'll both have
a change in status.

03:55.368 --> 03:56.568
(indistinct conversations)

03:56.570 --> 03:57.903
(goat bleating)

04:03.443 --> 04:04.810
Leith.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.314
It's been weeks
since we last spoke.

04:09.316 --> 04:10.582
I was beginning to think
you were avoiding me.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.784
Because I was. I am.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.653
But princess claude
insisted on

04:14.655 --> 04:16.288
A shopping trip to town.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.589
And what the princess
wants, she gets.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.259
Can I just say how sorry I am,

04:20.261 --> 04:22.327
About the way
things ended with us?

04:22.329 --> 04:24.363
How's business?

04:24.365 --> 04:26.665
Good. Thanks to your generosity.

04:26.667 --> 04:30.435
Actually, business is booming,
so I'll be able to pay you back.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.770
There's no need.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.406
I have no use
for the money.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.842
Not anymore.

04:52.325 --> 04:55.527
So, how are wedding plans
coming along?

04:55.529 --> 04:57.396
That's one perk
of being engaged to a madam,

04:57.398 --> 04:58.864
I bet she throws
a roaring party.

04:58.866 --> 05:01.767
Ready to return to the castle?

05:01.769 --> 05:03.335
Look at you, all business.

05:03.337 --> 05:05.437
Once you couldn't stop
talking about the epic,

05:05.439 --> 05:07.606
Insufferable love
you and greer share.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.474
Is the wedding
going to be in her whorehouse?

05:09.476 --> 05:11.343
With whore guests
and a whore officiant?

05:11.345 --> 05:13.979
If so, you have to invite me.

05:19.919 --> 05:21.320
I'm only teasing.

05:21.322 --> 05:22.421
But I am desperately curious

05:22.423 --> 05:23.755
About your upcoming nuptials.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.791
I command you
to give me details.

05:25.793 --> 05:29.728
You can command me to escort you
to every dress shop in town,

05:29.730 --> 05:31.697
Or to stand by your door
until I collapse.

05:31.699 --> 05:35.100
But there are some things that
even a princess has no claim to.

05:42.475 --> 05:44.476
Spruce bark.

05:44.478 --> 05:47.379
It's good for treating
infections and colds.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.548
You hunt, you trap,

05:49.550 --> 05:53.118
You bring people back
from the brink of death.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.487
You mean the ladies
at court can't do all that?

05:55.489 --> 05:58.890
Or read a man's past
and future by touching him?
(chuckles)

05:58.892 --> 06:01.059
They're more interested
in dancing and embroidery.

06:01.061 --> 06:04.429
But I think your skills
are far more useful.

06:04.431 --> 06:05.997
Well, I'm glad you think so.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.733
For the longest time,

06:07.735 --> 06:10.569
I prayed my gift
would be taken from me.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.037
Why?

06:12.039 --> 06:14.473
When I was a little girl,

06:14.475 --> 06:16.508
I saw the men in my village

06:16.510 --> 06:18.577
Drag a woman by her hair,

06:18.579 --> 06:20.879
Strap her to a post and...

06:20.881 --> 06:24.483
Plunge her into a freezing river
until she drowned.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.551
She was a midwife.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.987
But when one of the babies
she delivered was stillborn,

06:28.989 --> 06:31.022
The mother accused her
of using witchcraft.

06:31.024 --> 06:34.926
Said she stole
the baby's soul for the devil.

06:34.928 --> 06:38.897
Women who stick out
are apt to be killed.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.766
I suppose that's why
you've carved out

06:40.768 --> 06:42.567
A quiet life
for yourself.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.537
I've found it's best
to avoid people altogether.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.439
Must be lonely.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.508
You get used to it.

06:50.843 --> 06:52.878
You're a gifted seer,

06:52.880 --> 06:55.781
And there are places where your
talents would be appreciated.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.582
Do you know of nostradamus?

06:57.584 --> 06:59.684
I heard the queen mother herself
depended on his counsel.

06:59.686 --> 07:03.121
With him gone, the court
is in need of a new seer.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.524
Me? At court?

07:05.526 --> 07:06.992
You wouldn't
have to hide who you are

07:06.994 --> 07:09.094
Or what you do.
I doubt

07:09.096 --> 07:12.030
The court ladies would welcome
me into their embroidery group.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.598
You don't need them.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.133
You'd have me.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.668
At least
visit the castle,

07:16.670 --> 07:19.538
And see if it's a place
where you could be happy.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.808
I know I would be,
if I could...

07:22.810 --> 07:25.010
Look at your face
every day.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.618
â™ª I hear

07:34.787 --> 07:37.622
â™ª metal hearts

07:40.660 --> 07:42.727
â™ª clicking heels...

07:45.064 --> 07:47.599
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

07:50.503 --> 07:52.804
â™ª they all need something

07:52.806 --> 07:57.676
â™ª to hold on to,
they all mean well â™ª

07:57.678 --> 08:01.179
â™ª you could never
feel my story â™ª

08:01.181 --> 08:05.116
â™ª it's all you know... Oh!

08:05.118 --> 08:08.487
â™ª

08:20.066 --> 08:22.000
Conde:
Looking for me?

08:26.706 --> 08:28.273
That was a warning shot.
The next

08:28.275 --> 08:29.841
Will hit you between the eyes.

08:33.079 --> 08:35.614
How unfortunate that your men
are canvassing a section

08:35.616 --> 08:38.783
Of these woods miles away.
Lay down your weapon.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.687
Are you taking me prisoner?

08:42.689 --> 08:44.623
No. I'm making you an offer.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.691
You and your men can live
if you pledge yourself

08:46.693 --> 08:48.527
And your army to me.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.762
You want us to join your coup?

08:50.764 --> 08:53.932
My forces are stronger than
you or the king suspect.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.167
And there's something else
that might change your mind.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.673
Bertraud.
Father!

09:01.675 --> 09:02.841
My son.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.210
It's impossible--
he was captured

09:05.212 --> 09:07.746
At the battle of calais
by the english.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.748
You have the backing
of England.

09:09.750 --> 09:13.685
I hate to use a man's son
as a bargaining chip,

09:13.687 --> 09:15.720
But queen elizabeth
insisted.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.056
Help me take down
king francis and elizabeth

09:18.058 --> 09:19.691
Will release your son.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.760
And you could become
general to all

09:21.762 --> 09:23.728
France's armies under
the new order.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.764
The new king.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.632
You.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.701
I know what my future holds.

09:29.703 --> 09:32.103
The question is, do you?

09:37.610 --> 09:39.177
When do we start?

09:42.915 --> 09:44.883
It already has.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.785
We took the whole town
in two hours.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.588
They never saw us coming.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.823
The weapons facility
is entirely under our control.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.864
Set him free.

10:02.768 --> 10:05.070
Deliver a message
to king francis.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.706
Tell him prince condÃ© is coming.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.716
This is where the royal
family take their meals

10:17.718 --> 10:19.818
When it's not a
special occasion.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.920
It's a bit ostentatious.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.855
It's not that.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.791
I'm just more interested
in seeing your quarters.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.827
Your bedchamber, perhaps?

10:28.829 --> 10:32.263
We could finish
what we started in the woods?

10:32.265 --> 10:34.265
Kenna:
Bash!

10:34.267 --> 10:36.001
I've been looking
for you all day.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.702
If you could excuse
your woodsman,

10:37.704 --> 10:39.371
We have business
to discuss.

10:39.373 --> 10:42.307
Oh, good lord.
You're a woman.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.843
Oh, you must be
bash's mysterious friend

10:44.845 --> 10:46.645
Who lives in the forest.

10:46.647 --> 10:49.381
And you must be
kenna, his wife.

10:49.383 --> 10:50.982
You're exquisite.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.718
Oh.

10:53.720 --> 10:57.822
You have such a radiant
energy about you.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.824
Oh.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.060
Can you excuse us?

11:02.062 --> 11:03.795
Mm.

11:03.797 --> 11:08.066
Well, your new lady love
is quite the character.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.402
What do you want?
I'm happy for you. Truly.

11:10.404 --> 11:12.237
In fact, it just so happens

11:12.239 --> 11:14.305
That I, too, have moved on
with another.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.740
General renaude.

11:15.742 --> 11:18.143
Renaude? The mercenary?

11:18.145 --> 11:20.945
Former mercenary.
Quickly becoming

11:20.947 --> 11:23.114
Francis's right-hand man.
No offense.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.850
None taken,
but how is this my concern?

11:25.852 --> 11:27.152
Well, it concerns you

11:27.154 --> 11:29.788
In that you and I are still
husband and wife.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.089
You said you'd grant me
an annulment

11:31.091 --> 11:32.424
If the right man
came along, and,

11:32.426 --> 11:33.892
Well, he has.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.460
You're sure about him? Renaude?

11:35.462 --> 11:37.028
Sure as I can be.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.265
I'll talk to francis.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.934
Good luck to you.

11:42.936 --> 11:46.071
You, too.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.409
Bash (sighs):
Now you've met kenna.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.145
I hope
that wasn't uncomfortable.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.413
No, it wasn't.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.115
I'm not threatened by her.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.917
I had a vision of our future.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.885
Both of us, together,

12:00.887 --> 12:02.987
Surrounded by our children.

12:02.989 --> 12:05.190
Children? It seems...

12:05.192 --> 12:07.459
(chuckles)
...Premature.

12:08.994 --> 12:10.361
Man:
My lord,

12:10.363 --> 12:13.264
The king urgently
requests your presence.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.500
Excuse me.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.736
Man:
<i>By the time we realized</i>

12:17.738 --> 12:20.271
We were under attack, lord
condÃ©'s men had overwhelmed us.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.773
They took toulouse
in a matter of hours.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.007
Go with my men.

12:23.009 --> 12:24.342
We'll need details

12:24.344 --> 12:25.944
Of everything you saw and heard.

12:29.281 --> 12:31.516
So it's confirmed.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.518
CondÃ© means to take my crown.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.521
Toulouse is the main supplier
of our weapons to our troops.

12:36.523 --> 12:39.057
Taking it was a smart
tactical move, but

12:39.059 --> 12:41.526
Why would condÃ© announce
that he's coming for us?

12:41.528 --> 12:44.796
To intimidate us.
Bash:
Maybe he hopes

12:44.798 --> 12:47.465
To demoralize the soldiers
we have into deserting.

12:47.467 --> 12:50.401
Order general renaude and his
army to return to the castle.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.904
We'll need as many men
as we can get.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.405
And send messengers
to Spain.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.941
Tell king philip
to send troops immediately.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.210
We have an uprising to crush.

13:06.318 --> 13:08.486
(horse neighing)

13:08.488 --> 13:10.555
(sputtering and neighing)

13:10.557 --> 13:12.190
(catherine laughs)

13:12.192 --> 13:14.826
Narcisse:
This is it?
Catherine:
Mm-hmm.

13:14.828 --> 13:19.998
I confess, when you said you
had a fun surprise planned,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.866
An hour-long ride to
the middle of nowhere

13:21.868 --> 13:23.835
Was not what I had in mind.

13:23.837 --> 13:27.972
Mm.
I brought you here
to give you a present.

13:27.974 --> 13:31.042
(catherine laughs,
horse neighing)

13:33.479 --> 13:35.880
(horse sputters)

13:35.882 --> 13:37.215
(giggles)

13:37.217 --> 13:39.484
It can't be.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.853
Arion?

13:41.855 --> 13:44.556
(catherine laughs)

13:44.558 --> 13:48.226
He was the finest
andalusian in all of France.

13:48.228 --> 13:52.931
Many lords wanted him,
but I outbid them all.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.333
You know, back
then, my lands

13:55.335 --> 13:57.502
Stretched from rouen all
the way down to the coast.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.538
Arion and I would
ride all day,

14:00.540 --> 14:03.141
Knowing that everything
we surveyed was ours.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.944
I thought him lost,

14:05.946 --> 14:08.112
Dead, when my
lands were taken

14:08.114 --> 14:09.981
And my property sacked.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.150
(sighs)

14:12.152 --> 14:14.853
(horse chuffing)
how?

14:14.855 --> 14:17.288
Well, I may be cooped up
in a castle.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.458
Never forget, my reach is far.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.961
Think of this
as a gesture

14:22.963 --> 14:25.930
Of my continued appreciation
for your faithfulness.

14:25.932 --> 14:30.435
You do not need incentives
to ensure my loyalty.

14:30.437 --> 14:34.339
Surely by now I've proven
that you <i>can</i> trust me.

14:34.341 --> 14:37.342
I want to believe that.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.943
Then do.

14:38.945 --> 14:41.346
(hoofbeats approaching)

14:43.549 --> 14:46.017
(horse neighing)

14:47.553 --> 14:49.988
Your majesty, the
king has ordered

14:49.990 --> 14:52.190
All members of the royal family
return to the castle at once.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.925
What's happened?
I don't know.

14:53.927 --> 14:56.361
I was only told that your
safety could be at risk.

14:56.363 --> 14:59.130
(horse neighing)

14:59.132 --> 15:02.567
Catherine:
<i>I knew it was</i>
<i>a matter of time before</i>

15:02.569 --> 15:04.269
CondÃ© showed his true colors.

15:04.271 --> 15:07.205
I should have poisoned
him when I had the chance!

15:07.207 --> 15:10.608
A few weeks ago,
he was running for his life.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.076
Must we take his
threat seriously?

15:12.078 --> 15:13.378
I'm afraid we must.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.946
We're consolidating
the troops we have

15:14.948 --> 15:16.414
At the castle,
and reinforcements from Spain

15:16.416 --> 15:19.017
Should be arriving
within days.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.251
Bash:
The royal family
will be evacuated.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.120
For your safety, you
will be scattered,

15:22.122 --> 15:23.621
And sent abroad
to wait out the coup.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.324
Take only
what you need.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.559
God willing,
we'll be home soon.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.095
This is all your fault.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.563
We're all thinking it.

15:34.300 --> 15:37.168
(baby fussing)

15:39.605 --> 15:41.272
Before you go,

15:41.274 --> 15:43.174
I want john to
have something.

15:44.343 --> 15:47.111
This was mine
when I was a babe.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.147
My mother says
that it should be passed on

15:49.149 --> 15:50.949
To my royal heir.
I know that

15:50.951 --> 15:53.117
John will never be king,
but he should know

15:53.119 --> 15:55.119
Who his father was, and that
I claimed him to the world

15:55.121 --> 15:56.654
As my own.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.157
If anything were to
happen, tell him every day

15:59.159 --> 16:00.658
How much his
father loved him.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.394
I will, I promise.

16:03.396 --> 16:06.064
(baby cooing)

16:06.066 --> 16:09.434
Be safe.

16:09.436 --> 16:12.403
I won't be needing
a teary farewell,

16:12.405 --> 16:14.005
As I'm staying

16:14.007 --> 16:16.107
In the castle
as long as you are.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.242
Your younger sister and
brothers are safely abroad.

16:18.244 --> 16:22.180
My only concern
now is you.

16:25.684 --> 16:28.052
Perhaps I should
stay, as well.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.420
That's not a good idea.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.122
I could be of help.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.190
Our differences
aside...
It's not that.

16:32.192 --> 16:35.026
I failed to protect you
once before.

16:35.028 --> 16:37.261
If anything were
to happen to you,

16:37.263 --> 16:39.430
I would never be able
to live with myself.

16:40.566 --> 16:42.467
Very well.

16:43.569 --> 16:45.169
I'll do as you ask.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.371
I'll leave at first light.

16:53.078 --> 16:55.546
(horse sputtering)

16:57.783 --> 17:00.651
Man 1:
Whoa!
Man 2: Whoa!

17:03.322 --> 17:05.556
General renaude.
Is something the matter?

17:05.558 --> 17:07.158
Your majesty, thank
goodness we found you.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.060
The path ahead is
crawling with condÃ©'s men.

17:09.062 --> 17:10.528
It's not safe.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.164
I'm headed to the castle,
as the king commanded.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.233
But my men could guide
you to another route.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.734
You'll be safe
in their charge.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.136
(horse sputters)

17:18.138 --> 17:20.138
Very well.

17:21.507 --> 17:24.142
(horse sputtering)

17:24.144 --> 17:26.244
(horse neighing)

17:27.679 --> 17:29.147
I'll send word to lord condÃ©

17:29.149 --> 17:30.715
That we've captured the queen.

17:39.324 --> 17:41.225
(horse neighing,
indistinct chatter)

17:41.227 --> 17:44.829
Before the horses are rested
and we continue on our way,

17:44.831 --> 17:47.498
I wanted to be sure that we
weren't trading one unsafe route

17:47.500 --> 17:49.267
For another.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.102
When you saw condÃ©'s men,
where were they headed?

17:51.104 --> 17:52.537
One of our scouts
saw lord condÃ©

17:52.539 --> 17:54.105
Leading a company
across the river road

17:54.107 --> 17:55.673
From the direction
of st. Serafina's abbey.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.408
Then they were headed east.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.110
Yes.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.512
But condÃ© was last sighted
in toulouse,

18:01.514 --> 18:03.648
Which is east
of st. Serafina's.

18:04.616 --> 18:06.117
If he was approaching

18:06.119 --> 18:07.852
Our last position,

18:07.854 --> 18:09.754
He would have been heading west,

18:09.756 --> 18:12.156
Wouldn't he?

18:12.158 --> 18:14.125
Perhaps the scout
was confused.

18:14.127 --> 18:16.260
You also seem confused.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.696
Or is it something else?

18:21.867 --> 18:23.868
(horse neighing)

18:23.870 --> 18:25.503
Order your guards to stand down.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.238
If you come with us,

18:27.240 --> 18:29.407
Lord condÃ© says
no harm will come to you.

18:31.243 --> 18:33.878
(groaning and grunting)

18:35.481 --> 18:39.317
(groaning and grunting continue)

18:39.319 --> 18:41.886
(horse neighing,
men grunting)

18:44.289 --> 18:47.291
(horse neighing,
men shouting and grunting)

18:51.697 --> 18:54.198
Bash.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.300
(groans)

18:56.302 --> 18:57.702
Damn.
(inhales sharply)

18:57.704 --> 18:59.670
Aah.
Oh, you're bleeding.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.239
Let me help.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.207
I'm... I'm all right.

19:03.209 --> 19:06.310
You're used to taking care
of yourself, aren't you?

19:06.312 --> 19:08.779
You don't need anyone telling
you what's in your future.

19:08.781 --> 19:09.914
(sighs)
or who.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.282
I saw your face

19:11.284 --> 19:13.184
When I described
our future together.

19:13.186 --> 19:14.485
It's not that I don't wish
to be with you...

19:14.487 --> 19:15.820
No need to explain.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.788
Destiny can feel
like a burden.

19:17.790 --> 19:21.492
A yoke, as if we have no role
to play,

19:21.494 --> 19:23.227
No choices of
our own to make.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.662
That's not
how it works.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.264
I've seen a <i>likely</i>
<i>path ahead,</i>

19:26.266 --> 19:28.499
Not the only path.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.301
I suppose I should be grateful

19:30.303 --> 19:32.270
You've seen any path
at all, given

19:32.272 --> 19:35.173
The threats we face. Thank you
for explaining yourself.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.440
Better?

19:36.442 --> 19:39.210
Much.

19:43.582 --> 19:46.184
I should go.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.819
I'll have servants
prepare you a guest chamber.

19:51.423 --> 19:53.891
(door opens and closes)

20:01.466 --> 20:03.868
Could you fetch
some warm clothes for john?

20:03.870 --> 20:06.337
Our carriage
will be leaving soon.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.773
(sighs)
god save us on our journey.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.609
(john cooing)

20:11.611 --> 20:13.444
Lola.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.379
Stephan.

20:15.381 --> 20:18.349
What are you doing here?
I heard

20:18.351 --> 20:19.650
That you and john were leaving.
I came to say good-bye.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.486
Mm. And what about you?

20:22.488 --> 20:25.489
I would think a man
who values self-preservation
as much as you do

20:25.491 --> 20:27.658
Would have similar plans
to flee the castle.
The queen mother

20:27.660 --> 20:29.660
Has elected
to go down with the ship.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.429
Therefore, so will I.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.431
Should I expect
more embarrassing drawings

20:33.433 --> 20:34.732
Of me to appear,

20:34.734 --> 20:36.367
Once catherine learns
of this visit?

20:36.369 --> 20:37.668
You've heard
of our relationship.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.503
I had a feeling that your wager

20:39.505 --> 20:41.372
With the lords was a charade.

20:41.374 --> 20:43.407
Your real aim was
to push me away.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.676
And who else
but catherine would want that?

20:45.678 --> 20:47.745
I don't know what's
more contemptible, the fact

20:47.747 --> 20:50.548
That she asked you to humiliate
me or that you agreed.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.483
I deserve that.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.485
You're better than this.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.420
You don't have
to be catherine's lap dog.

20:56.422 --> 21:00.491
No one ends a relationship
with catherine de medici.

21:00.493 --> 21:01.892
Then why are you here
with me now?

21:01.894 --> 21:05.563
Why do people commit acts

21:05.565 --> 21:08.566
That defy sense, even...

21:08.568 --> 21:11.569
Self-preservation?

21:11.571 --> 21:15.306
Why did mary risk her throne
for a man she could never marry?

21:15.308 --> 21:16.741
Why did francis see
what his wife was doing

21:16.743 --> 21:19.010
And still look away?

21:19.012 --> 21:21.445
What are you saying?

21:21.447 --> 21:25.683
I'm saying that should anything
happen to either of us, I hope

21:25.685 --> 21:27.451
That you will remember me
not as the man who lied,

21:27.453 --> 21:29.387
Who betrayed you.

21:30.589 --> 21:32.456
I hope you will remember me

21:32.458 --> 21:33.991
As the man
who would have cherished you,

21:33.993 --> 21:35.760
If he had had the chance.

21:57.382 --> 21:58.983
Kenna:
Mary!

21:58.985 --> 22:00.985
Shouldn't you be on
your way to naples?

22:00.987 --> 22:02.720
Where is francis?
I need to see him.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.955
The watchman saw you arrive.
Are you all right?

22:04.957 --> 22:07.058
Francis, listen carefully.

22:07.060 --> 22:09.360
Renaude has changed sides.
He serves condÃ© now.

22:09.362 --> 22:11.696
General renaude?
Are you certain?
If my guards hadn't defended me,

22:11.698 --> 22:14.031
I would be his prisoner now.
Did they try to hurt you?

22:14.033 --> 22:16.701
They said condÃ© ordered them
not to harm me.

22:16.703 --> 22:17.968
He probably wanted you
as a hostage.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.603
What better wedding gift
for elizabeth

22:19.605 --> 22:21.472
Than her greatest rival
for the english throne?

22:21.474 --> 22:23.741
It's not important what condÃ©
planned to do with me.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.444
The question is what he plans
to do with renaude.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.879
You said all condÃ© needs to do
to win is kill you.

22:28.881 --> 22:32.783
Who better to deploy than
a general who's close to court?

22:32.785 --> 22:35.419
Toulouse was a ploy.

22:35.421 --> 22:38.823
CondÃ© knew
that I'd send for renaude.

22:38.825 --> 22:40.358
We need to keep him
and his army away

22:40.360 --> 22:41.492
From the castle at all costs.

22:41.494 --> 22:43.561
It might be
too late.

22:44.996 --> 22:47.498
(portcullis chains clinking)
(indistinct chatter)

23:05.384 --> 23:08.052
(indistinct chatter)

23:15.594 --> 23:18.095
Lower the portcullis!
By command of the king!

23:18.097 --> 23:20.831
But my men...
Loose the chains
and let it fall!

23:20.833 --> 23:21.699
Watch out!
Move!

23:21.701 --> 23:22.833
They're coming!

23:23.902 --> 23:25.069
Engage renaude and his men!

23:25.071 --> 23:27.538
They are
traitors!

23:27.540 --> 23:28.572
Keep them off
the ramparts!

23:28.574 --> 23:30.975
(shouting, grunting)

23:45.490 --> 23:47.925
Man:
Archers, loose!

23:47.927 --> 23:49.126
(shouting)

23:57.135 --> 23:58.903
Where is everybody?

23:58.905 --> 24:00.905
They're hiding.
We're under siege.

24:00.907 --> 24:03.007
You're being
frightfully overdramatic.

24:03.009 --> 24:04.875
We have walls,
don't we?

24:04.877 --> 24:07.711
Walls can be
breached. Run.

24:07.713 --> 24:09.613
Run!

24:15.520 --> 24:17.188
Back! Everyone back!

24:17.190 --> 24:19.623
Don't fire
until they top the wall!

24:21.893 --> 24:23.494
Hold for my command!

24:25.897 --> 24:27.031
Hold!

24:28.867 --> 24:29.934
Hold!

24:32.671 --> 24:33.871
(shouts)

24:36.608 --> 24:37.741
Fire!

24:37.743 --> 24:42.046
(shouting)

24:42.048 --> 24:43.614
Nock and ready
for the next wave!

24:48.019 --> 24:49.854
I'm outnumbered,
but I won't let them take you.

24:49.856 --> 24:51.856
We have to find someplace
to hide.
The passageways.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.524
We used to play in them
when we were children.

24:53.526 --> 24:54.525
Renaude's men
won't know of them.

24:54.527 --> 24:57.895
Where are they?
All around.

24:57.897 --> 25:00.164
You just have to know
where to look.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.736
(men shouting, grunting)

25:19.918 --> 25:22.686
(grunting)

25:29.661 --> 25:30.661
Bash! Behind you!

25:35.667 --> 25:37.902
(grunting)

25:50.181 --> 25:52.583
(shouts, grunts)

25:52.585 --> 25:54.552
Man:
The general's
been taken!

25:54.554 --> 25:56.120
Fall back!
Fall back!

25:56.122 --> 25:58.856
Well done, men.
The first victory is ours.

25:58.858 --> 26:01.091
(men cheering)

26:08.233 --> 26:10.768
(grunting)

26:10.770 --> 26:13.270
(panting)

26:14.973 --> 26:17.641
(birds calling)

26:19.077 --> 26:21.612
Kenna:
This was your plan
all along, wasn't it?

26:21.614 --> 26:23.814
To get close to me,
to gain access to court,

26:23.816 --> 26:26.250
To learn all you could
about the king's weaknesses.

26:26.252 --> 26:27.651
She has my son, kenna.

26:27.653 --> 26:29.653
Queen elizabeth
holds bertraud captive.

26:29.655 --> 26:31.655
I saw him
with my own eyes.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.991
She blackmailed me,
through condÃ©.

26:33.993 --> 26:35.826
Betraying the crown
against my will

26:35.828 --> 26:38.162
Was the only chance I had
of saving his life.

26:38.164 --> 26:40.965
And now that you've failed...

26:40.967 --> 26:43.734
I'm sorry. Truly.

26:43.736 --> 26:46.770
I meant everything I said.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.639
I wanted
a life with you.

26:48.641 --> 26:51.842
Elizabeth took that life
from us.

26:51.844 --> 26:54.678
And now I'd like
to take something from her.

26:54.680 --> 26:57.815
What do you mean?

26:57.817 --> 27:02.186
These may be my last hours
on earth.

27:02.188 --> 27:06.690
I'd like to use them
in service to my sovereign king.

27:07.692 --> 27:09.860
Kenna:
Mary!

27:09.862 --> 27:13.030
Kenna. What's wrong?
It's condÃ©'s army.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.366
He doesn't only have
his and renaude's men.

27:15.368 --> 27:17.368
<i>But thanks to elizabeth's gold</i>
<i>and support,</i>

27:17.370 --> 27:19.370
<i>He has the armies of hundreds</i>
<i>of french protestant lords</i>

27:19.372 --> 27:21.772
<i>At his command.</i>

27:21.774 --> 27:23.841
(men shouting, horses neighing)

27:23.843 --> 27:26.343
They started arriving
in the last hour.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.946
And more
all the time.

27:36.354 --> 27:39.690
Bash:
My watchman puts condÃ©'s forces
at 900, maybe 1,000 men.

27:39.692 --> 27:42.359
There's still a chance for us to
get you beyond the castle walls

27:42.361 --> 27:44.361
And to safety.
Francis:
It's too late for that.

27:44.363 --> 27:47.765
The fight is upon us, and
a king must stand his ground.

27:47.767 --> 27:50.200
The castle's a good stronghold.
It's built to withstand

27:50.202 --> 27:52.202
Any siege.
Not against these odds.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.104
Our numbers
are vastly inferior.

27:54.106 --> 27:57.141
Which is why you're arming
women and teenage boys.

27:57.143 --> 28:00.878
But what chance do they have
against 900 trained soldiers?

28:00.880 --> 28:03.847
We need every able-bodied person
we can get.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.849
King philip's troops
are still days away.
Can we hold off

28:05.851 --> 28:07.785
CondÃ©'s army until then?

28:07.787 --> 28:10.821
We have to. It's our only chance
for survival.

28:10.823 --> 28:14.692
My lord. We've received
a message from the enemy.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.760
Prince condÃ© requests
a meeting with the king.

28:17.962 --> 28:19.430
One-on-one.

28:27.038 --> 28:28.906
(clattering in distance)

28:28.908 --> 28:30.474
Who's there?

28:31.843 --> 28:34.144
It's all right. You're safe.

28:34.146 --> 28:37.915
I have orders to escort you
to the ballroom, where women

28:37.917 --> 28:39.917
And children will be safe
and under heavy guard.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.051
You might have saved my life

28:41.053 --> 28:43.053
By helping me reach
the tunnels.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.989
I protected you. It's my duty.
I'm sorry.

28:45.991 --> 28:48.992
For being difficult,
for constantly poking about

28:48.994 --> 28:50.260
In your private life.

28:50.262 --> 28:51.829
Claude...
No.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.230
You take your job seriously.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.998
You proved that today.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.468
I can take it seriously, too.

29:02.907 --> 29:06.143
Yesterday I snapped
at you, when you asked

29:06.145 --> 29:08.779
About greer
and the wedding.
Leith, you don't have to...

29:08.781 --> 29:10.414
There isn't going
to be any wedding.

29:10.416 --> 29:11.882
It's over. Greer ended it.

29:11.884 --> 29:13.817
She'd rather
be alone

29:13.819 --> 29:15.886
Than with a man who can never
make her feel safe.

29:17.956 --> 29:21.358
Greer has a fierce streak
of independence,

29:21.360 --> 29:23.160
And that's something
I can relate to.

29:23.162 --> 29:25.996
But having you in my corner
like I did today,

29:25.998 --> 29:28.265
If I could have that for life...

29:32.337 --> 29:33.303
(screams)

29:33.305 --> 29:34.872
Who's there?!

29:34.874 --> 29:37.341
(gasping)
who was it? What did you see?

29:37.343 --> 29:39.810
Something in the shadows.
Someone.

29:39.812 --> 29:43.046
He was
right there.
Go back inside.

29:50.889 --> 29:56.293
Your invitation
was most unexpected.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.128
The other women and children
are all huddled together

29:58.130 --> 29:59.363
In the ballroom,

29:59.365 --> 30:02.399
Contemplating their mortality.

30:02.401 --> 30:07.237
And as scintillating as I'm sure
their company would prove to be,

30:07.239 --> 30:10.841
I'd prefer to go out
with a fine meal in my belly.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.050
Mm.

30:20.052 --> 30:22.085
I appreciate the gesture,
but the men

30:22.087 --> 30:24.922
Could use my help in preparing
for the battle to come.

30:24.924 --> 30:28.859
I'm sure bash and his team
are more than prepared.

30:28.861 --> 30:30.961
I led armies.

30:30.963 --> 30:33.997
Surely those skills
still count for something.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.866
Something more than just

30:35.868 --> 30:37.935
Occupying the queen mother.

30:39.571 --> 30:42.039
Perhaps your annoyance
stems not from

30:42.041 --> 30:44.007
Missing out
on the impending fight,

30:44.009 --> 30:46.210
But from missing
your precious

30:46.212 --> 30:49.012
Lady lola?

30:50.415 --> 30:52.449
I thought we'd
put that particular

30:52.451 --> 30:54.952
Brand of jealousy to bed.

30:54.954 --> 30:57.521
I've been watching you, stephan.
Oh, you mean
you've been having me followed?

30:57.523 --> 30:59.289
My spies--

30:59.291 --> 31:01.558
They saw you and lola
outside a <i>brothel</i>

31:01.560 --> 31:03.026
In the village.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.295
That was weeks ago,
and it was nothing more

31:05.297 --> 31:06.964
Than a chance encounter.

31:06.966 --> 31:09.633
And just today
you were seen embracing her

31:09.635 --> 31:12.469
Mere feet
from where

31:12.471 --> 31:15.138
My grandson lay sleeping.

31:16.641 --> 31:18.609
Was that also nothing?

31:18.611 --> 31:20.510
I was saying good-bye.

31:20.512 --> 31:23.881
Because even after swearing
your allegiance to me,

31:23.883 --> 31:26.383
Nothing could stop you
from stealing a kiss

31:26.385 --> 31:28.051
From that child as she

31:28.053 --> 31:29.453
Fled the castle.

31:29.455 --> 31:31.021
What's wrong?

31:31.023 --> 31:32.356
Have you lost
your appetite?

31:32.358 --> 31:34.124
Had I known
the strings attached,

31:34.126 --> 31:35.626
I might have
declined the offer.

31:35.628 --> 31:38.028
No.

31:38.030 --> 31:41.999
Not after I worked so hard
to prepare you a special dinner.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.502
I hope your steak
wasn't too gamey.

31:45.504 --> 31:48.105
With the castle on
lockdown, provisions

31:48.107 --> 31:49.573
Are low, and the kitchen staff--

31:49.575 --> 31:52.342
They're not accustomed
to preparing horsemeat.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.411
Especially on
such short notice.

31:56.681 --> 31:58.181
Arion?

31:58.183 --> 31:59.917
My horse.

32:01.686 --> 32:03.120
(gags)

32:03.122 --> 32:05.055
(coughing)

32:07.125 --> 32:08.692
I love you.

32:09.661 --> 32:10.961
I'm your equal!

32:10.963 --> 32:13.096
You convinced
me of that.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.097
We belong together.

32:14.099 --> 32:16.099
I won't lose you
to another.

32:16.101 --> 32:18.101
And especially not her.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.436
This is love to you?

32:19.438 --> 32:21.505
Strangling someone
with threats

32:21.507 --> 32:25.142
And ruthlessly controlling them
just to ease your own fears?

32:25.144 --> 32:27.444
I ease my fears
because they're mine,

32:27.446 --> 32:29.112
Because they matter.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.614
I'm a woman.
I won't accept

32:30.616 --> 32:33.984
What that means anymore.
I won't bow to a lover.

32:33.986 --> 32:36.119
I was forced to do
that once for a king.

32:36.121 --> 32:39.990
But you... Are most
certainly not a king.

32:39.992 --> 32:42.326
And you honestly think
that we can move forward?

32:42.328 --> 32:43.994
That I can accept
this behavior

32:43.996 --> 32:46.263
And remain at your side?
You claimed

32:46.265 --> 32:48.665
To love me
for my fierce will.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.600
But you seem to have remained
a man of your times,

32:50.602 --> 32:51.668
Who must learn that

32:51.670 --> 32:53.971
Loving me
means loyalty

32:53.973 --> 32:56.073
And sacrifice.

32:56.075 --> 32:59.009
I have faith. In time,

32:59.011 --> 33:01.712
You will exercise both

33:01.714 --> 33:04.581
Because I've given
you my heart.

33:04.583 --> 33:06.717
But should you not...

33:06.719 --> 33:10.153
Should I feel mistreated...

33:10.155 --> 33:13.090
Well, mark my words,

33:13.092 --> 33:14.558
My response will be

33:14.560 --> 33:18.161
A hell of a lot worse
than a gristly piece of meat.

33:26.270 --> 33:30.107
War is nearly upon us.
I will pray for your safety.

33:36.047 --> 33:38.081
It was some sort of demon.
You're frightened.

33:38.083 --> 33:39.416
But I searched
the tunnel.

33:39.418 --> 33:41.018
If someone was there,
they're gone.

33:41.020 --> 33:42.152
You don't believe me.

33:42.154 --> 33:43.286
But I know what I saw.

33:43.288 --> 33:44.721
Come with me.

33:44.723 --> 33:47.090
You'll feel better
when you join the others.

33:47.092 --> 33:48.558
Nothing can get to you there.

33:59.604 --> 34:02.205
Man:
Archers, hold.

34:18.489 --> 34:21.658
I wish there was a way
to end this without bloodshed.

34:21.660 --> 34:24.194
Whose blood
concerns you more--

34:24.196 --> 34:26.229
Your husband's
or your lover's?

34:38.242 --> 34:40.177
As my archers would indicate,
I don't appreciate

34:40.179 --> 34:41.678
Being summoned
by a traitor.

34:41.680 --> 34:44.214
Give up the castle.
Surrender peacefully.

34:44.216 --> 34:45.749
Surrender?

34:45.751 --> 34:47.717
I am the king of France.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.419
Surrender will save the soldiers

34:49.421 --> 34:51.621
And innocent lives
you still have left.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.123
It could save mary.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.358
Mary is elizabeth's chief rival.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.294
If I allow you
to take the castle,

34:57.296 --> 34:58.261
She'll demand the
queen of scots'

34:58.263 --> 34:59.529
Head on a platter.
Elizabeth

34:59.531 --> 35:01.131
Is backing my bid
for the crown.

35:01.133 --> 35:02.232
Protestant France

35:02.234 --> 35:04.234
Would be reward enough for her.

35:04.236 --> 35:06.369
She will always see
mary as a threat.

35:06.371 --> 35:08.672
Not if mary becomes my wife.

35:08.674 --> 35:10.273
She could convert.
She wouldn't be the first person

35:10.275 --> 35:12.209
To do so
for political gain.

35:12.211 --> 35:15.145
And as the ruler of a protestant
country allied with England,

35:15.147 --> 35:16.613
She would no longer
be a threat to elizabeth.

35:16.615 --> 35:19.149
Do you honestly
believe that I would

35:19.151 --> 35:21.351
Give up my kingdom, my wife?

35:21.353 --> 35:23.253
Surrender now
and mary will live.

35:23.255 --> 35:24.654
Your plan relies on the
cooperation of a fickle

35:24.656 --> 35:26.289
English queen who does not

35:26.291 --> 35:28.225
Take kindly to the
advice of others.

35:28.227 --> 35:30.827
It also relies
on me losing my head.

35:30.829 --> 35:33.230
There can't be two kings.
No.

35:33.232 --> 35:35.398
There cannot.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.701
Which is why I
reject your offer.

35:37.703 --> 35:39.503
I refuse to surrender.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.738
My reign will not end
without a fight.

35:41.740 --> 35:42.839
Doesn't mary's life
mean anything to you?

35:42.841 --> 35:44.841
It means a great deal.

35:44.843 --> 35:47.210
Which is why you're the
last man I'd entrust it to.

35:47.212 --> 35:49.913
You still think
you can win, don't you?

35:49.915 --> 35:53.216
That there's help on the way,
that king philip will save you?

35:53.218 --> 35:55.719
That's right. I know
all about the messengers.

35:55.721 --> 35:58.388
The urgent cry
to Spain for help.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.190
The first
didn't reach the border

36:00.192 --> 36:01.525
Before my men
intercepted him.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.360
The second, too,
fought valiantly,

36:03.362 --> 36:04.794
But he was outmatched
and captured.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.530
The third...

36:11.169 --> 36:12.402
Well, he's
no longer with us.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.438
There is no help
on the way.

36:15.440 --> 36:18.175
No one
is coming for you.

36:18.177 --> 36:20.610
Surrender, francis...

36:20.612 --> 36:23.480
Or we'll attack at dawn.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.331
Delphine:
How do you feel now?
Rather well.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.366
Perfect.

36:43.368 --> 36:44.768
What are you doing?

36:44.770 --> 36:46.269
What's that?

36:46.271 --> 36:47.771
Preparations.

36:47.773 --> 36:50.674
A bloody shirt?
I'm just a servant.

36:50.676 --> 36:52.876
While I appreciate you
sharing your wine with me....

36:53.978 --> 36:55.478
Don't worry.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.380
I think you'll be pleased.

36:57.382 --> 36:58.882
Is this because
we're all gonna die?

37:00.318 --> 37:02.519
Heard the armies
outside attack at dawn.

37:02.521 --> 37:04.921
I couldn't help thinking
myself I'd rather

37:04.923 --> 37:06.690
Like to have a last go.

37:06.692 --> 37:08.291
Is that what
this is?

37:08.293 --> 37:10.327
It's a binding ritual.
A what?

37:12.330 --> 37:13.697
Lie down, please.

37:15.299 --> 37:18.301
â™ª we'll take it all

37:19.971 --> 37:21.538
<i>Ay bluntar</i>

37:21.540 --> 37:23.373
<i>Et raynim stuntabli.</i>

37:23.375 --> 37:24.441
What was that?

37:24.443 --> 37:25.442
What did I just say?

37:25.444 --> 37:27.444
You're speaking pagan.

37:27.446 --> 37:30.380
I don't feel
like myself.

37:30.382 --> 37:32.882
That's because
you're not yourself.

37:39.390 --> 37:42.592
â™ª so it begins.

37:42.594 --> 37:45.428
If I thought for a moment
that condÃ© could guarantee

37:45.430 --> 37:48.398
Your survival,
I would have agreed.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.733
Surrendered?

37:49.735 --> 37:51.301
Lost the castle
and your life

37:51.303 --> 37:52.636
Without a fight?

37:52.638 --> 37:54.471
I am the king, but I am also

37:54.473 --> 37:57.507
A husband. CondÃ©'s still
in love with you, mary.

37:57.509 --> 38:01.278
That's why he kidnapped you.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.980
He sees a future for
the two of you after my death.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.816
Nothing has changed
for him.

38:06.818 --> 38:09.052
And he probably justifies
this whole thing-- the coup

38:09.054 --> 38:11.821
And waging war on
his home country--

38:11.823 --> 38:14.691
By clinging to the idea that
he can somehow save your life.

38:14.693 --> 38:17.327
But he can't

38:17.329 --> 38:19.729
Save you,
not from elizabeth.

38:19.731 --> 38:21.931
And come tomorrow,

38:21.933 --> 38:23.933
Barring a miracle,

38:23.935 --> 38:26.469
We will both be dead.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.583
Just know, whatever happens,

38:40.585 --> 38:42.519
This is not

38:42.521 --> 38:44.754
The end I dreamed for us.

38:58.969 --> 39:01.037
â™ª

39:16.387 --> 39:18.021
I told you
not to disturb me.

39:19.457 --> 39:21.558
Mary.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.426
Leave us.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.529
Francis told me what you said.

39:26.531 --> 39:27.897
That you wanted to keep me safe.

39:27.899 --> 39:31.000
That you wanted to take
the crown and make me your wife.

39:31.002 --> 39:34.637
That's all I ever wanted.
I've come to tell you
that's what I want, too.

39:34.639 --> 39:37.841
No. What sort of trickery...
It's not a trick. Louis, please.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.509
You know
I loved you.

39:39.511 --> 39:41.544
And real love
never fades, not truly.

39:41.546 --> 39:42.846
You have to believe me.

39:42.848 --> 39:44.714
I can't be with francis.

39:44.716 --> 39:47.584
Not now.
Yet you've chosen him
over me, time and again.

39:47.586 --> 39:49.652
He is my husband and I don't
want harm to come to him.

39:49.654 --> 39:52.689
But something has happened.

39:52.691 --> 39:54.991
If francis wins this fight--

39:54.993 --> 39:56.493
If he holds on to his crown--

39:56.495 --> 39:58.661
Then my fate is sealed.
My death is sealed.

39:58.663 --> 40:02.599
Francis would never
let that happen to you.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.534
No matter how much
you've hurt him.

40:04.536 --> 40:07.470
There is evidence of our affair.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.472
Of our love and my treason.

40:09.474 --> 40:12.809
Evidence that even francis
could never pardon.

40:14.745 --> 40:16.679
I haven't shared a bed
with my husband in months.

40:16.681 --> 40:18.081
And yet, still...

40:19.917 --> 40:23.086
Louis, I am pregnant.

40:23.088 --> 40:25.555
I am carrying
your child.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.891
Please, save me.
