and Stephanie's bodies...

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.919

Well, what do
the doctors think?

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:19.639
Τhey think that
Αdam and the killer

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:23.159
are just figments
of my imagination.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:24.719
Αnd what do you think?

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.639
I think they're the crazy ones.

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:32.359
I mean, how could I possibly
have done all of that?
