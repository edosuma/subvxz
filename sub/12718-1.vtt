01:09.486 --> 01:10.652
Nice view.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.955
Perfect timing.

02:15.009 --> 02:17.177
Wait a minute. He's not alone.

02:17.345 --> 02:19.388
That's a heartbreaking piece of news.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.640
Pull the plug, Ned.
There's a kid in the car.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.559
There's a drug lord
in the car, Ray.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.770
- Kid just took a bad ride, that's all.
- Abort the action.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.898
You're the rigger.
I am the trigger. I make the call.

02:30.066 --> 02:34.278
You just sit back and
watch the show. Okay, sport?

02:35.738 --> 02:37.948
Activate the fail-safe,
you fucking psycho.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.285
Here's a tip, Ray.
There is no fail-safe.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.495
Come on. Come on.

03:06.102 --> 03:07.352
You'll never make it.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.339
You're an arrogant man,
Raymond.

04:18.507 --> 04:21.969
I taught you everything you know
and you dare to turn on me.

04:22.136 --> 04:23.762
Are you gonna kill me too,
colonel?

04:23.930 --> 04:26.890
You're a specialist, captain.
You deserve better.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.029
Don't forget to write, partner.

05:06.889 --> 05:09.599
You like watching her die?
You like taking them down?

05:09.767 --> 05:13.520
Now I'm taking... you down.
You're finished in the agency.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.897
You're going nowhere.

05:16.065 --> 05:18.942
You're as dead as those people...

05:19.110 --> 05:23.101
in the river.
We both are.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.934
<i>Have you decided to take the job?</i>

07:16.102 --> 07:17.936
I saw your ad today.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.105
- I know it's late...
- It's never too late.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.275
<i>After all,
you're about to give me a new life.</i>

07:24.527 --> 07:25.527
Really? When?

07:25.695 --> 07:27.946
<i>When you kill those three bastards.</i>

07:28.114 --> 07:30.282
I'm flattered.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.034
Look, uh,
you better get somebody else.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.203
<i>I like your voice.</i>

07:35.371 --> 07:37.914
Yeah, but you don't need
an explosives contractor for a job like this.

07:38.082 --> 07:40.208
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

07:40.918 --> 07:43.211
<i>- You are my only hope.
- Go to court, use the law.</i>

07:43.379 --> 07:45.505
<i>The law's been bought.</i>

07:46.716 --> 07:49.259
- Then you gotta use a bullet.
- Bullets...

07:49.427 --> 07:50.594
are imprecise.

07:50.761 --> 07:55.098
<i>I heard that you control your explosions,
that you shape your charges.</i>

07:55.266 --> 07:57.726
What I shape and who I shape them for
is my business.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.269
<i>All I'm saying...</i>

07:59.437 --> 08:01.938
<i>word is you were the best.</i>

08:02.106 --> 08:03.356
Whose word?

08:03.524 --> 08:04.983
<i>If we could just meet...</i>

08:05.151 --> 08:08.403
I don't meet, I don't work in Miami
and I don't do jobs like this.

08:08.571 --> 08:11.239
<i>Then why do you keep
calling me back?</i>

08:11.407 --> 08:14.920
Why?
I like your voice.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.041
What is it? My cologne?

09:21.644 --> 09:23.144
So, what do you think, uh,
you guys, uh, coming?

09:23.312 --> 09:24.312
Go ahead, please.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.981
- All right, all right.
- How many are there?

09:26.148 --> 09:27.399
Two or eight?

10:20.411 --> 10:23.371
<i>These guys are killers.
You'd be doing the world a favor.</i>

10:23.539 --> 10:27.083
<i>I don't owe the world any favors.
Why did you wait so long?</i>

10:27.251 --> 10:28.293
<i>I thought...</i>

10:29.670 --> 10:32.047
<i>I thought maybe it would pass.</i>

10:32.214 --> 10:34.674
<i>Every day is worse.</i>

10:35.009 --> 10:37.010
<i>Remembering what happened...</i>

10:37.178 --> 10:40.013
<i>That's what I do
instead of being alive.</i>

10:40.431 --> 10:43.266
<i>My father hid me in a closet.</i>

10:44.060 --> 10:46.061
<i>I could still see.</i>

10:47.521 --> 10:49.147
<i>My mother... suffered.</i>

10:50.149 --> 10:51.816
<i>- No.
- I don't know anything.</i>

10:51.984 --> 10:54.027
<i>They tortured her
to get my father to talk.</i>

10:54.195 --> 10:55.570
<i>We're gonna have to kill her.</i>

10:55.988 --> 10:58.448
<i>He walked by something
he shouldn't have seen.</i>

11:00.576 --> 11:03.119
<i>They covered his face
with the pillow from my bed.</i>

11:03.579 --> 11:05.038
<i>- Mommy.
- Waste 'im.</i>

11:05.623 --> 11:07.040
<i>But it was too small.</i>

11:07.958 --> 11:09.501
<i>So they shot 'im.</i>

11:11.253 --> 11:14.381
<i>I never thought...
blood would be so sticky.</i>

11:15.758 --> 11:18.301
<i>Sometimes I think
I can never wash it off.</i>

11:30.106 --> 11:33.650
<i>The only thing I understand
anymore is revenge.</i>

11:33.818 --> 11:36.444
<i>I'm going in
and I'm gonna do it myself.</i>

11:36.612 --> 11:39.030
<i>- You'll only get one of 'em.
- That's why I need you.</i>

11:41.450 --> 11:42.992
<i>- To do it right.
- I told you...</i>

11:43.160 --> 11:45.453
<i>I don't do
this kinda job anymore.</i>

12:01.303 --> 12:04.556
<i>I know you've been watching me,
trying to decide...</i>

12:04.724 --> 12:08.643
<i>if I'm on the level,
if you're gonna take the job.</i>

12:08.811 --> 12:10.729
<i>Well, I can't wait anymore,
I'm going in.</i>

12:10.896 --> 12:13.648
<i>- They'll make you.
- I have an alias.</i>

12:13.816 --> 12:15.316
<i>Adrian Hastings.</i>

12:15.484 --> 12:17.318
<i>Wish me luck.</i>

12:50.186 --> 12:51.519
Senor Leon.

12:55.357 --> 12:58.109
So, uh, how's it coming in?

12:59.987 --> 13:01.988
Oh, boy.
You don't give up, hm?

13:03.574 --> 13:07.243
It's packed in Monopoly boxes.

13:07.411 --> 13:09.496
Oh, he's right over here.
I want you to meet him.

13:09.663 --> 13:11.498
That's great, papa.

13:11.665 --> 13:16.377
- All right, you get it in, I'll put it on the street.
- Sure, sure, sure. You do that.

13:18.714 --> 13:20.840
Tomayo, come 'ere.

13:21.008 --> 13:24.135
- Ahem. How you doing, Ned?
- This is a very nice party.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.430
- Yeah.
- You went all out. It's fantastic.

13:30.100 --> 13:33.311
- So let's talk numbers.
- Ah, forget business tonight.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.397
Go grab yourself
a nice little mulatta.

13:37.566 --> 13:40.068
I want my money, Tomayo.

13:42.029 --> 13:45.073
An advance.
Small token of my family's goodwill.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.950
Token?

13:47.493 --> 13:49.077
Token.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.457
Now, listen to me, boy.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.084
You know
what the Dark Ages are?

13:56.252 --> 13:59.128
The Dark Ages are what I brought
the Leon family out of.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.880
I computerized your operation.

14:01.048 --> 14:05.927
I streamlined your security.
I dragged you into the 20th century.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.638
So don't fuck with me on this.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.139
What is this?

14:10.307 --> 14:13.643
A tip? I don't work for tips.
She works for tips, okay?

14:13.811 --> 14:16.229
Now, I want my money.
I want it now.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.314
Go get it.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.485
It's always a pleasure
working with you, Ned.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.200
Champagne, please.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.693
Thank you.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.725
Is there something you want?

16:19.061 --> 16:21.896
What I want, I take.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.439
Champagne?

16:24.149 --> 16:26.192
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.906
Welcome to our bank.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.410
I've never seen you before.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.121
I used to live here
when I was a little girl.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.082
A lot's happened
since you've been gone.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.724
- Like what?
- Like me.

16:46.171 --> 16:50.059
- Insecurity is a terrible thing.
- It would be.

16:52.636 --> 16:53.761
I'd like to dance.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.139
What's wrong with keeping
the conversation goin'?

16:56.306 --> 16:59.267
Later. Right now,
I'm taking what I want.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.689
You look beautiful tonight.

17:40.893 --> 17:46.731
I'll have my driver to pick you up tomorrow
and I'll show you my Miami.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.250
Now.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.171
Right on time.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.641
Should I do it, Timer?

18:29.483 --> 18:31.359
Morning, sir.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.862
Yeah.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.301
Hey.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.746
- Hey, let him play.
- Hey, baby.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.248
- Come on.
- Kinda young

18:45.415 --> 18:48.042
- to be riding this bus alone, aren't you?
- Stop it.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.878
- What? I'm not good enough for you?
- Come on, young one.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.713
Don't move over. I wanna play.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.507
Come on, baby.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.176
- Come on.
- Stop. Leave me alone.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.636
Come on now, what's up, huh?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.813
Come on, baby. Don't be shy.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.357
Here, why don't you take my seat?

19:12.401 --> 19:13.985
Thank you.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.530
Yo, check her out, man.

19:20.617 --> 19:21.659
That seat's taken.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.203
- Quit it. Ah!
- Fuck you.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.707
- Excuse me?
- Fuck you.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.313
Come on.

19:29.751 --> 19:30.960
It's all right.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.091
Hold these, please.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.676
Give it back to her.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.469
Stop.

19:46.602 --> 19:47.768
Hey.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.898
What's goin' on?

19:52.774 --> 19:53.774
You asshole!

19:53.942 --> 19:55.026
Stop that!

20:01.200 --> 20:02.685
You're dead.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.949
I hate knives.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.091
Fuck you, you son of a... Oh!

20:35.817 --> 20:38.236
I believe there's a vacancy.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.610
- So, what do you drink?
- Martini.

21:21.321 --> 21:25.533
Martini on the rocks.
Gold tequila, straight up.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.328
No one knows Miami like I do.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.582
You like spending the day with me?

21:33.750 --> 21:35.126
Yeah.

21:36.586 --> 21:39.005
- Do you?
- Mm-hm.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.841
- Kiss me.
- Hardly know you.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.057
Wait till you try
spending the night.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.278
Thanks.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.465
Stay here.
I gotta take care of something.

22:23.550 --> 22:25.343
Got a light?

22:32.434 --> 22:34.643
Is this that piece of shit? Hm?

22:46.656 --> 22:48.767
- Where were you?
- I was home.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.121
Thanks.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.642
Thanks, amigo.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.527
What happened to you?

23:24.986 --> 23:28.124
- I just didn't like the show, that's all.
- Uh-huh.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.324
You don't...

23:30.492 --> 23:32.410
walk away from me...

23:33.995 --> 23:35.371
ever.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.706
You understand?

23:38.458 --> 23:39.500
Sorry.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.671
- Get in the car.
- Sure.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.654
<i>Every time...</i>

24:09.322 --> 24:11.574
<i>he touches me, I...</i>

24:13.076 --> 24:16.495
<i>I mean,
he's the man who shot my father.</i>

24:16.663 --> 24:18.205
<i>And he's...</i>

24:20.459 --> 24:24.846
<i>kissing me and...
Oh, God.</i>

24:26.756 --> 24:28.716
<i>You don't have to do it.</i>

24:28.884 --> 24:32.720
<i>It's the only way I can get
close enough to kill 'im.</i>

24:37.058 --> 24:39.894
<i>See, I have this... dream.</i>

24:40.061 --> 24:42.980
<i>I'm right there when it happens.</i>

24:43.315 --> 24:47.193
<i>He looks at me...
like I'm a stranger.</i>

24:47.360 --> 24:49.653
<i>Then I say my name.</i>

24:50.989 --> 24:55.618
<i>And it's the last thing
he ever hears.</i>

24:56.328 --> 25:00.046
<i>- They don't suspect you?
- I'm trusted, for the moment.</i>

25:03.210 --> 25:05.085
<i>He's with you all the time.
How do you live?</i>

25:05.253 --> 25:06.795
<i>Alone.</i>

25:07.964 --> 25:09.632
<i>That's not what I mean.</i>

25:10.091 --> 25:12.092
<i>How do you live...</i>

25:12.761 --> 25:13.761
<i>with yourself?</i>

25:13.929 --> 25:15.930
<i>How do you?</i>

26:32.674 --> 26:34.341
Hey, you!

26:36.845 --> 26:38.053
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

26:41.349 --> 26:42.516
You think you know me?

26:43.476 --> 26:46.186
I asked you a question.
You think you know me?

26:47.188 --> 26:50.190
Cause the way you're looking at me,
we must be old friends.

26:50.358 --> 26:53.436
- Where did we meet?
- Nowhere.

26:54.974 --> 26:59.366
Nowhere...
You like the bitch? Huh?

27:06.166 --> 27:08.000
Maybe you like me.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.712
No, I don't like you.

27:13.882 --> 27:16.342
Then don't stare so hard.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.969
Somebody could...

27:20.055 --> 27:21.430
put something in your eye.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.403
Fucking pervert.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.762
Let's move it.

28:03.264 --> 28:04.823
Good night.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.438
- Adrian.
- Mm.

29:27.390 --> 29:30.517
- Yeah.
- Are you listening?

29:31.468 --> 29:33.729
- Uh-huh.
- First rule:

29:34.063 --> 29:36.857
Don't go near them again.

29:37.025 --> 29:38.984
Second rule:

29:39.152 --> 29:40.903
Don't contact me.

29:41.070 --> 29:44.420
- I'll contact you.
- Maybe I can help you.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.441
- Let me see...
- No.

29:46.951 --> 29:49.495
They're my problem now
and I'm theirs.

29:53.082 --> 29:55.209
Are you close enough
to walk over?

30:03.885 --> 30:05.886
Rule three:

30:06.846 --> 30:08.388
<i>If this is a setup...</i>

30:09.265 --> 30:11.767
I... kill you.

30:49.430 --> 30:51.849
- Hey, Manny.
- Now what?

30:52.016 --> 30:54.935
I'm serious. That cop was a regular.
Juanita's moving in on me.

30:55.103 --> 30:58.480
Get the hell outta here.
I don't solve domestic problems.

30:58.648 --> 31:00.086
Asshole.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.923
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.468
Lucky me.

32:00.335 --> 32:04.066
- Hey, Charlie.
- Senor...

32:18.061 --> 32:20.187
The word is, Manny...

32:20.355 --> 32:21.480
you're skimming.

32:22.523 --> 32:26.045
Somebody's lying.
Hey, hey, I never took a dollar.

32:26.861 --> 32:28.826
I hope it ain't you.

32:29.322 --> 32:32.282
Because if you're trying
to screw Joe Leon...

32:32.450 --> 32:36.401
Come on, Charlie, you know me,
what, 10 years?

32:37.372 --> 32:41.465
- Hey, I'm clean.
- Good. Very good.

32:42.543 --> 32:45.128
Then you have nothing
to worry about, do you?

32:47.048 --> 32:48.173
Let me see the books.

33:18.621 --> 33:21.415
I can't take this anymore.
That is it. What?

33:21.582 --> 33:24.342
- How 'bout a drink?
- Sure.

33:28.256 --> 33:29.297
September's missing.

33:31.050 --> 33:33.010
See you, Manny.

33:45.314 --> 33:46.732
What do you feel like doin'?

33:58.786 --> 34:00.203
What?

34:00.371 --> 34:02.122
I'm working here.

34:02.290 --> 34:03.790
You have two fucking hours,
come mierda.

34:21.641 --> 34:23.143
Get another job, kid.

34:36.032 --> 34:39.493
They got two bodies in there.
Something that used to be Charlie...

34:39.659 --> 34:41.703
and a clean hit
on your brothel manager.

34:41.871 --> 34:42.954
That was a bright move.

34:43.121 --> 34:45.581
Something you ordered, Tomas,
and didn't bother to tell me about?

34:45.750 --> 34:46.792
He was a thief.

34:47.293 --> 34:49.210
- Tell me about the bomb.
- Very clean.

34:49.670 --> 34:52.255
There was no damage
to the left or right of the blast.

34:52.422 --> 34:55.391
The item that was used to set it off
was impacted inside the C4

34:55.391 --> 34:58.553
so the arming device was vaporized.
Brilliant planning, totally professional.

34:58.721 --> 35:00.180
Gotta be a specialist.

35:00.556 --> 35:02.682
- This guy is good, Joe.
- Yeah, okay.

35:02.850 --> 35:05.874
He could put a bomb in your crab shell
you wouldn't even know it.

35:07.980 --> 35:09.314
I'll kill the son of a bitch.

35:09.482 --> 35:13.068
You can't kill anybody, Tomayo,
until we know who he is, can you?

35:14.237 --> 35:15.570
I'll find 'im.

35:15.738 --> 35:18.729
The important thing to find out,
who he works for, right?

35:19.408 --> 35:20.700
Maybe he works for the CIA.

35:20.868 --> 35:23.537
Maybe he works for the Mafia,
the Italians, I don't know,

35:23.704 --> 35:26.039
but we have
to find out who, okay?

35:26.207 --> 35:27.207
Overview, Joe.

35:28.042 --> 35:31.002
We have to ask ourselves
what does eliminating Charlie mean

35:31.170 --> 35:32.879
- in the overall picture?
- Nothing.

35:33.047 --> 35:35.465
Less than nothing.
So this target wasn't territorial.

35:35.883 --> 35:36.925
It was personal.

35:38.302 --> 35:40.345
How the fuck
do you know so much?

35:40.513 --> 35:44.127
He's guessing, papa. Let me take a couple
of the boys, I'll find out who this bastard is.

35:44.127 --> 35:47.435
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. Gimme
a second here. I have to make a decision.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.637
Little time to think here, huh?

35:55.069 --> 35:57.112
Okay.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.530
You take over, okay?

35:59.448 --> 36:03.118
- Papa...
- I said, Trent will handle it, okay?

36:03.286 --> 36:05.495
- I don't hear you saying "okay".
- Okay, papa.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.080
- What did you say?
- Okay, papa.

36:07.248 --> 36:09.260
That's nice. Thank you.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.698
I'm gonna need resources
on this one, Joe.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.595
And also, the place was crawling
with cops.

36:21.762 --> 36:24.649
I can't be tripping over fucking
civil servants every move I make.

36:24.649 --> 36:28.602
- I need total control.
- Yeah, okay, well, I will, uh...

36:28.769 --> 36:31.646
I will take care of that,
you know?

36:34.942 --> 36:38.028
Personally. Okay?

38:00.111 --> 38:02.070
Hello, Timer.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.714
Having a good day?

38:09.912 --> 38:13.331
Here you go.
Knock yourself out.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.576
<i>I saw it on the news.</i>

38:50.036 --> 38:52.245
<i>You got the first one.</i>

38:52.413 --> 38:53.663
<i>Thank you.</i>

38:54.290 --> 38:57.751
<i>- Thank you.
- Well, I'm just doing my job.</i>

38:57.918 --> 39:00.628
<i>- You gotta stay away from the other two.
- I could help you.</i>

39:00.796 --> 39:03.006
<i>I could... set them up for you.</i>

39:03.174 --> 39:06.176
<i>No, no. You just
stay away from those guys.</i>

39:06.719 --> 39:09.804
<i>Their future is about
to become very dark.</i>

39:09.972 --> 39:14.467
<i>You're still following me.
Aren't you?</i>

39:15.936 --> 39:18.688
<i>- It's gotten so I can feel you.
- It's all part of the work.</i>

39:20.066 --> 39:23.243
<i>Do you think about me?
I think about you.</i>

39:24.070 --> 39:26.154
<i>My own personal ghost.</i>

39:27.239 --> 39:28.365
<i>Or angel maybe.</i>

39:29.617 --> 39:32.077
<i>- We could meet.
- You are a beautiful woman.</i>

39:32.787 --> 39:33.953
<i>But I don't meet.</i>

39:34.121 --> 39:37.799
<i>- When this is over, I should leave.
- When are you gonna do it?</i>

39:38.751 --> 39:41.588
<i>Soon. Very soon.</i>

39:46.684 --> 39:50.261
Amigos. Trent,
you know the... chief of police.

39:50.429 --> 39:52.764
Trent is gonna work with us
on this problem.

39:52.932 --> 39:58.990
You know, I mean,
he was a former employee of the, uh, CIA.

39:59.146 --> 40:03.483
And he is an explosives expert
and I think he can be a big help.

40:03.651 --> 40:04.651
I don't know.

40:04.819 --> 40:07.987
This has become very public,
and I'm sure you wanna keep a low profile.

40:09.448 --> 40:10.663
Yeah, please.

40:11.534 --> 40:14.411
It'd be hard for Ned to go unnoticed,
if you know what I mean.

40:15.496 --> 40:19.207
Well, you know, I think there's more
involved here than keeping a low profile.

40:22.002 --> 40:26.297
I venture to say that I'm the one you can trust,
which is the main word here, Joe. Trust.

40:26.465 --> 40:29.509
- To take him out clean.
- Our bomb boys are some of the best in the world.

40:29.677 --> 40:31.845
Really, chief?
Well, I hope that's true.

40:32.012 --> 40:35.515
They'd better be fucking magicians
because this is one very impressive man.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.016
What are you, a fucking fan?

40:37.518 --> 40:40.562
Okay, come on now.
Stop that, this is serious, right?

40:40.729 --> 40:42.147
Don't you two start.

40:43.023 --> 40:46.276
We're here to find a way to protect
the business. Don't forget that.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.862
Is that understood?

40:49.530 --> 40:54.534
Okay, chief, uh, I have to tell you...
that this one is not negotiable.

40:54.702 --> 40:58.163
Look, Joe, I'll do what I can.
Put him on as a fed or something.

41:01.465 --> 41:05.152
Okay. Hasta luego, amigos.

41:05.212 --> 41:06.379
- Joe.
- Take care.

41:06.547 --> 41:08.882
Chief, always a pleasure.

41:09.049 --> 41:11.718
- Hey, chief, good to see you again.
- Hey, Tomas.

41:11.886 --> 41:13.636
See you, papa.

41:14.889 --> 41:18.349
Okay, Danny, here,
help me up.

41:18.976 --> 41:21.561
Oh, boy.
I hate that deep couch.

41:23.439 --> 41:27.859
Okay. Now, listen.
Danny, you'll do me a favor.

41:28.027 --> 41:30.904
You do your best to make
this thing look official.

41:31.405 --> 41:34.532
No, please. You do that,
and I promise you...

41:34.700 --> 41:36.701
I will not forget you.

41:36.869 --> 41:37.952
Okay?

41:40.372 --> 41:41.684
Danny.

41:43.959 --> 41:46.303
A man's gotta eat, no? Heh.

41:52.686 --> 41:53.581
Idiota.

42:01.477 --> 42:05.591
Hey, Gonzales, wait up.
I wanna show you those files.

42:07.566 --> 42:09.554
Hey, sport,
where's the bomb squad?

42:20.663 --> 42:24.040
Hey, come on, boys and girls. Come on.
What are we doing here? Let's look alive, huh?

42:24.458 --> 42:27.335
- What've you got?
- We're looking into everyone at the party...

42:27.503 --> 42:29.504
doing a complete
background check, okay?

42:31.465 --> 42:32.924
Give me the next one,
all right?

42:43.644 --> 42:48.574
Tell you what. I'll handle the biographies.
You go back to tracing C4. Okay, ace?

42:50.985 --> 42:53.444
Chief says you're on this. Fine.

42:53.988 --> 42:58.157
But I don't take orders from
any ex-anything. All right, ace?

42:59.868 --> 43:02.996
And I gotta tell you something.
I'm-I'm sorry, but I thought your chief said

43:03.163 --> 43:05.832
that the fullest cooperation
would be forthcoming.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.334
And I gotta tell you something, sport.

43:08.502 --> 43:10.878
This doesn't feel like
full cooperation to me.

43:11.046 --> 43:13.715
I mean, look at this shit here.
What is this? This is, uh...

43:13.882 --> 43:16.843
Shouldn't this be in the lock-up?
I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

43:17.011 --> 43:20.013
You guys are the experts.
Maybe you don't need me.

43:20.180 --> 43:22.890
I mean, like, what is this?
This is, um...

43:24.059 --> 43:25.101
This is Semtex.

43:25.269 --> 43:27.437
Am I right? Plastique.

43:27.605 --> 43:30.732
Plastic explosive. Am I right?
I don't know, you're the expert.

43:30.899 --> 43:34.068
I mean, this little bit could blow up
this whole area, and if this area goes...

43:34.236 --> 43:36.362
the whole building could go up.
Am I right?

43:36.739 --> 43:38.197
Gosh, I don't know.
I mean...

43:39.116 --> 43:41.242
maybe if I put this in here...

43:43.245 --> 43:45.038
What else
do we have here? Oh.

43:45.205 --> 43:49.292
This is a-a... a plunger detonator, am I right?
And that's a little mini receiver.

43:49.752 --> 43:53.630
You know, this looks like American circuitry to me.
And I gotta tell you, call me a patriot...

43:53.797 --> 43:57.258
but American craftsmanship,
it's the greatest in the world.

43:57.426 --> 44:00.268
See? Watch this. Here we go.

44:00.804 --> 44:02.600
Let's just see.

44:02.681 --> 44:07.644
Yup. Perfect fit, first time,
every time. Screw it on.

44:08.103 --> 44:09.479
And one little twist.

44:09.647 --> 44:14.233
And voila.
A perfect receiver bomb.

44:14.401 --> 44:15.449
Which of course is...

44:16.153 --> 44:18.738
absolutely worthless without a...

44:19.615 --> 44:21.286
transmitter.

44:23.077 --> 44:24.827
But hey!

44:29.416 --> 44:31.668
Twenty seconds and...
we're hot.

44:32.586 --> 44:34.045
Okay?

44:34.213 --> 44:37.256
Okay. Now you deactivate it,
you sanctimonious prick.

44:37.424 --> 44:40.051
- Okay, you cut that shit, Trent.
- Oh, yeah. Huh?

44:40.219 --> 44:42.428
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay, you made your point, all right?

44:42.596 --> 44:44.514
Have I? Huh? Huh?

44:44.682 --> 44:46.516
- Hey, that's enough.
- What do you mean, it's enough?

44:46.684 --> 44:49.894
You think I give a shit if this whole
fucking block goes up? I don't.

44:50.062 --> 44:52.605
Maybe you've had enough.
Isn't that what you're saying?

44:52.773 --> 44:55.066
Yes, that's what I'm saying.
Enough is enough!

44:55.234 --> 44:57.110
- I can't do it.
- Twelve.

44:57.277 --> 44:59.404
What the hell,
are you crazy or something?

44:59.571 --> 45:02.407
I'm the craziest person
you'll ever meet in your life.

45:03.659 --> 45:06.411
Six, five...

45:06.578 --> 45:09.622
- four, three...
- Please.

45:19.550 --> 45:21.183
Now, here's a tip.

45:21.385 --> 45:23.594
You take care of the shit work.

45:24.054 --> 45:27.890
You leave the folks
at the party to me. Okay?

45:28.058 --> 45:30.226
We on the same page here?

45:32.855 --> 45:34.313
Ace.

46:13.854 --> 46:15.938
How do you like it?
Those go upstairs.

46:16.106 --> 46:17.926
I like where I live.

46:19.401 --> 46:23.179
- I like you where I live.
- Thanks.

46:24.198 --> 46:26.699
Close the doors. Get out.

46:40.464 --> 46:41.923
Better than
what you're used to, huh?

46:42.382 --> 46:44.383
You know,
the next time you order a hit,

46:44.551 --> 46:47.365
you might wanna consider
taking out your decorator.

46:51.642 --> 46:53.726
You like to live dangerously,
don't you?

46:54.561 --> 46:56.979
A little danger
never killed anybody.

46:57.147 --> 46:58.773
Right, baby?

47:00.025 --> 47:02.109
Sometimes.

47:15.707 --> 47:17.208
You know...

47:17.376 --> 47:19.669
when I look at you...

47:20.921 --> 47:24.048
I see something
I like very much.

47:25.133 --> 47:29.069
- You know what it is?
- I'm breathless with anticipation.

47:30.472 --> 47:31.722
I see me.

47:44.903 --> 47:46.654
<i>Let's get this shit over with.</i>

48:08.552 --> 48:09.837
Wait a minute.

48:11.263 --> 48:13.036
You're the mob's accountant, Bill.

48:13.515 --> 48:15.641
Is, uh that all you got for me?

48:15.809 --> 48:19.812
No, no.
I have something else for you.

48:25.152 --> 48:26.485
See you guys. Peace.

48:26.653 --> 48:30.573
Don't touch that!
It could be a bomb.

48:32.910 --> 48:34.667
Very funny.

49:46.066 --> 49:47.959
Son of a bitch.

50:05.335 --> 50:06.419
Hey, kid.

50:08.755 --> 50:10.923
Look at the way you parked
my fucking car.

50:12.370 --> 50:15.302
But, sir,
I-I didn't park your car.

50:16.847 --> 50:19.265
Sorry. I'll get it for you.

50:57.846 --> 50:59.805
Here's your tip.

52:30.730 --> 52:33.566
<i>Keep everybody back.
Everybody back, please.</i>

52:36.570 --> 52:39.613
- Some ride that must've been.
- Black and white coming. Let them in.

52:39.781 --> 52:41.574
Is this the decoy?

52:42.325 --> 52:44.493
Who the fuck
was this supposed to fool?

52:46.580 --> 52:49.456
- Any witnesses?
- Over there.

52:49.708 --> 52:51.008
The kid?

52:52.294 --> 52:53.889
Here you go.

52:55.630 --> 52:57.454
Nice one, Ray.

52:58.091 --> 52:59.532
Clever boy.

53:05.098 --> 53:06.140
<i>Everybody back.</i>

53:08.602 --> 53:10.644
"Bye-bye."

53:11.104 --> 53:13.397
Well, at least he hasn't lost
his sense o' humor.

53:19.112 --> 53:20.946
Who gave you permission
to smile?

53:21.615 --> 53:22.907
Shut up.

53:46.973 --> 53:49.117
Quite a step up for you,
isn't it?

53:49.643 --> 53:51.412
Depends on how you look at it.

53:52.312 --> 53:55.564
- Look, Ned, Tomas is on his way...
- Shut up.

53:55.732 --> 53:58.181
Who are you? Hm?

53:58.360 --> 54:00.069
I said, who are you?

54:00.612 --> 54:01.820
Who are you? Huh?

54:01.988 --> 54:05.157
I'll tell you who you are.
You are nobody.

54:05.325 --> 54:08.327
I created Adrian Hastings.
I got you inside.

54:08.495 --> 54:11.705
You work for me. And please
don't you ever fucking forget it.

54:13.917 --> 54:16.502
Now, you're supposed to have him
out in the open by now.

54:16.670 --> 54:18.837
You get your three corpses,
I get Ray Quick.

54:19.005 --> 54:21.706
That was the bargain.
What happened, May?

54:21.925 --> 54:24.718
I can't keep him on the line
long enough to get a trace.

54:24.886 --> 54:26.512
He doesn't wanna
take a meeting.

54:27.347 --> 54:29.890
What do you want me to do, Ned?
Wish him out of hiding?

54:30.058 --> 54:31.934
You know, May, maybe
you're in over your head on this thing.

54:32.102 --> 54:34.812
Maybe you've outlived your usefulness.
Is that possible?

54:34.980 --> 54:36.647
Listen, to me, Ned,
you need me.

54:37.607 --> 54:39.817
I studied him, I drew 'im out.

54:41.528 --> 54:44.947
It was my voice, it was my ads.
He trusts me.

54:45.824 --> 54:47.533
Why do I need you, May?

54:47.951 --> 54:51.036
Why don't I just grab 'im
before he brings Tomas down?

54:51.204 --> 54:53.122
Why do you even need...

54:53.290 --> 54:54.707
to live at all, May?

54:54.874 --> 54:59.253
Cause maybe he's not interested in
a big-mouth, hotshot asshole like you, Ned.

55:02.257 --> 55:05.301
You know what I've always loved
about you, May?

55:06.511 --> 55:09.445
It's not just this... poetry.

55:12.058 --> 55:13.851
It's your heart.

55:14.561 --> 55:17.479
It's the heart
you bring to your work.

55:17.981 --> 55:20.316
But I promise you,
if you don't get him to set up a meeting

55:20.483 --> 55:22.443
before he drops the third target,

55:22.610 --> 55:25.321
you will pray for a lifetime
of Tomas's attentions...

55:25.488 --> 55:27.740
his... delicate touch.

55:27.907 --> 55:30.242
- I promise.
- Don't touch me, Ned.

55:30.410 --> 55:31.452
I'm sorry.

55:35.707 --> 55:38.000
I've always wondered, May...

55:39.085 --> 55:41.045
what was it like...

55:42.297 --> 55:44.590
after you watched
your parents die.

55:44.758 --> 55:46.800
Did you go over to the bed?

55:47.761 --> 55:50.478
Did little May... hug them?

55:51.222 --> 55:53.766
Did you try to shake them awake?

55:55.185 --> 55:56.602
How much blood?

55:56.770 --> 55:59.188
I'm just curious, was there...

56:00.357 --> 56:02.208
a lot of blood, May?

56:02.442 --> 56:04.077
Don't push me, Ned.

56:22.170 --> 56:25.964
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Take it easy, hotshot.

56:26.224 --> 56:27.758
I'm just checking up on you.

56:27.926 --> 56:30.636
I don't need you goddamn
babysitting for me, Trent.

56:31.596 --> 56:33.806
Why the hell aren't you out
looking for who's hittin' on us?

56:33.973 --> 56:36.058
That's great, Tomas.
What's the first move? Hum?

56:36.226 --> 56:39.630
- Door-to-door search? Hum?
- I'm sick of you.

56:40.647 --> 56:42.439
My father thinks he needs you.

56:43.233 --> 56:45.109
When he finds out he doesn't...

56:45.276 --> 56:46.610
you're mine.

56:47.301 --> 56:52.533
- Well... I feel threatened.
- You are threatened.

56:52.534 --> 56:53.534
Ciao.

58:15.742 --> 58:17.451
- Tommy, Miguel, you in?
- I'm in, boss.

58:17.619 --> 58:19.027
- Me too.
- Come on.

58:19.329 --> 58:20.717
Get it together.

58:21.289 --> 58:22.770
Five hundred.

58:33.426 --> 58:35.280
Okay, I'm outta here.

59:40.702 --> 59:42.035
Just a second.

59:45.540 --> 59:46.873
May Munro.

59:53.285 --> 59:54.161
Come on!

59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.345
- Where are you going?
- Come on! Get up!

01:00:00.513 --> 01:00:03.265
Go in there! Get 'im!
Get the fuck in there!

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:05.976
Get back.

01:00:07.353 --> 01:00:09.187
Keep them back.

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:13.025
Come on, get 'em out!

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:15.736
Get 'em... out!

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:24.655
Good one, Ray.
Really good.

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:13.168
Joe, I am so sorry.

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:24.837
You're sorry?

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.651
My son...

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:34.272
is in a closed casket...

01:01:35.608 --> 01:01:40.195
and... heh, you are sorry.

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:43.949
Well... I hold you responsible.

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:45.867
He wouldn't lay low.

01:01:46.327 --> 01:01:47.869
What'd you say?

01:01:50.998 --> 01:01:52.457
I said he wouldn't lay low.

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:57.129
Are you trying to tell me
that was his fault now?

01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:58.296
That's the way it was.

01:01:58.464 --> 01:02:02.175
The way it was?
You were supposed to protect his back.

01:02:02.343 --> 01:02:04.344
His life was in your hands.

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:06.304
You know what you do?

01:02:06.472 --> 01:02:09.516
You... cut my heart out,
you know?

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:12.728
And now you look, my...

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:16.982
My son...

01:02:17.775 --> 01:02:20.277
is lying in a box.

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:21.987
- Joe, I...
- And you know...

01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:24.156
you were the one...

01:02:24.323 --> 01:02:25.782
who let it happen.

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:30.162
- Joe, you're not thinking straight.
- Jesus Christ, don't you try to tell me.

01:02:30.329 --> 01:02:32.372
I swear to God,
don't say another word.

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.583
Not another word. I'll kill you here.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:37.836
You understand? Hm?

01:02:47.221 --> 01:02:48.722
Now...

01:02:49.682 --> 01:02:54.311
you... you go out...

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:59.274
you go out and you find
this explosive expert...

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:00.734
and you...

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:07.082
bring him to me alive,
before I bury Tomas.

01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:32.075
"Adrian Hastings. Miami, Dade County.
Services 3 p.m., Friday.

01:04:32.243 --> 01:04:33.618
San Juan De Bosco."

01:04:33.786 --> 01:04:35.430
Too bad, May.

01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:42.043
Her body's in cold storage
at County General.

01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:47.132
How does this sound?

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.635
"Lonely, needy, deeply hurt.
Will be discreet."

01:04:50.803 --> 01:04:53.068
Story of my life.

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:58.310
Yeah. So get this on every major
bulletin board service.

01:04:58.477 --> 01:05:00.896
Put the response number
through a long-distance exchange

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:03.982
- and be ready to trace. Okay?
- Okay.

01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:38.391
Guys like this, they're really good,
they're not gonna advertise.

01:05:38.559 --> 01:05:41.549
You gotta draw them out.
Just do your best.

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:46.608
<i>Hi, baby.
You wearing any underwear?</i>

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:47.817
<i>Could you send it to me?</i>

01:05:47.985 --> 01:05:51.237
- Get rid of this asshole.
- Yeah, well, I don't think your experience

01:05:51.405 --> 01:05:53.365
- matches my needs, buddy.
- Get rid of him.

01:05:53.532 --> 01:05:54.908
That's what I'm doing.

01:05:55.868 --> 01:05:59.412
We've had 30 calls and nothing.
I don't know if this makes any sense.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:02.614
You know what? I'll decide if
it makes any sense or not, okay?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.460
Go on, take it. Take it!

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:07.429
Line five and...

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.422
- Go.
- Hello?

01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:11.911
<i>Calling about the ad, right?</i>

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:15.562
Yeah.

01:06:16.889 --> 01:06:18.316
Right.

01:06:18.891 --> 01:06:20.558
I thought
you were someone else.

01:06:21.894 --> 01:06:23.742
<i>The ad was similar to others.</i>

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.532
Yeah, well, give me a number
cause I can't talk on this phone.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:28.858
No. Forget it.

01:06:29.026 --> 01:06:31.027
You have a message from May.

01:06:31.195 --> 01:06:33.530
<i>I've got a message...</i>

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:34.948
from May.

01:06:36.575 --> 01:06:38.451
- Who is this?
- She's okay.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.328
She wants to meet you.

01:06:41.205 --> 01:06:42.747
No, I don't think so.

01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:48.670
Put Trent on the line.

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:49.879
What did you say?

01:06:50.047 --> 01:06:52.882
Trent should be standing next to you.
Put him on the line. I wanna talk to 'im.

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:56.386
Put 'im on the line!

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:01.641
<i>Hey, Ned, can you hear me?</i>

01:07:02.643 --> 01:07:05.020
Come on, talk to me.
Come on, talk to me, Ned.

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:06.688
<i>New playmates know
what kind of man</i>

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:09.831
<i>they're dealing with?
Why the agency fired you? Huh?</i>

01:07:10.317 --> 01:07:13.204
That killing people, pulling the trigger
was like jerking off for you?

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:17.032
Cause watching bloody bodies going though the air
is what really gets you off, doesn't it, Ned?

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:19.451
<i>- Come on, talk to me, Ned.
- I need time.</i>

01:07:19.618 --> 01:07:23.621
<i>When you crawl into your hole at night, all alone,
you are alone, aren't you, big guy?</i>

01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:25.498
Tell me what burns you the most.

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:28.918
<i>Losing your job
as a CIA attack dog</i>

01:07:29.086 --> 01:07:32.589
or knowing that I turned you in
and I'm still alive?

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:34.288
Come on, talk to me!

01:07:35.092 --> 01:07:38.620
You sell your service to the highest bidder,
won't you, you stinking maggot!

01:07:38.804 --> 01:07:42.368
Fuck you, Ray! Fuck you!
You killed!

01:07:42.975 --> 01:07:44.059
Your bombs!

01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:47.979
How many? Ten? Fifty?
A hundred before you lost count?

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:52.650
It was your bombs on the bridge in Bogota.
Your bomb in the cabana.

01:07:52.818 --> 01:07:55.612
<i>But you're getting sloppy, Ray.
You broke your famous code, didn't you?</i>

01:07:56.072 --> 01:08:00.283
You killed an innocent bystander, Ray.
It is just eating you up inside, isn't it?

01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:03.661
Well, you were always
too fucking sensitive. But guess what.

01:08:04.171 --> 01:08:07.165
<i>I'm comin', Ray. I'm comin'
to take all the pain away.</i>

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:09.259
I'm gonna fucking cut it
right out of you

01:08:09.259 --> 01:08:11.544
and I'm gonna close your heart
in my hand.

01:08:11.712 --> 01:08:14.506
I'm right behind you
and I know you. I know you.

01:08:14.673 --> 01:08:19.059
You got no mercy.
You got no fucking loyalty.

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:20.553
And you got no code.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.015
- Listen to me, you son of a bitch...
- Hey, time's up, 58 seconds.

01:08:24.322 --> 01:08:27.417
Ray! Ray! God! Wait.

01:08:28.562 --> 01:08:30.814
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

01:08:30.981 --> 01:08:33.483
I'll fucking kill you!
I'll vaporize your ass!

01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:35.517
What're you looking at?!

01:08:38.697 --> 01:08:40.149
Turn around!

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:48.747
Nobody...

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:50.959
says a word.

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:55.305
Now you tell me
that you got a trace.

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:57.309
Just tell me.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.341
He jumped off
before we locked him.

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:00.926
- Okay.
- We got a partial trace.

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:02.761
Shut up.

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:30.957
She gave of herself...

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.648
for 40 years.

01:09:33.919 --> 01:09:36.671
She dedicated her life...

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:38.381
generously...

01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:40.633
courageously...

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:43.803
to all of us,
Cuban orphans everywhere.

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:47.432
She has shown us the road.

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.853
For the wages sin pays is death.

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:55.023
But the gift God gives...

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:56.900
is everlasting life...

01:09:57.067 --> 01:09:59.569
by Christ, Jesus, our Lord.

01:11:03.425 --> 01:11:04.717
So how did I look?

01:11:43.048 --> 01:11:46.828
- Why did you do this?
- I wanted to meet you.

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:52.772
I wanted to know if you were
everything I thought you'd be.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.892
Nobody ever is.

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:21.669
Hold it.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.381
Open the casket.

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:30.094
- Who are you?
- I said, open the fucking casket.

01:12:39.563 --> 01:12:42.403
Bitch. Fuck!

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:19.612
We shouldn't be here.
Not if we wanna stay alive.

01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:23.868
- Is it worth it?
- I think so.

01:13:28.195 --> 01:13:29.695
I hope so.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:54.795
Let me see this beautiful face.

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:15.119
- Why'd you leave me to think I killed you?
- I thought it was the only way

01:16:15.119 --> 01:16:18.781
- I could get Tomas's men off my back.
- You wanna give me details?

01:16:19.645 --> 01:16:22.296
Poor lady OD'd
in the emergency room.

01:16:24.204 --> 01:16:27.560
So I dropped my wallet
in her purse and... here I am.

01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:34.868
That's pretty good, especially...
if you're an amateur.

01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:39.268
You could've been killed.

01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:44.941
I had to be there when he died.
I needed to see it.

01:16:48.186 --> 01:16:50.187
Anyway...

01:16:51.898 --> 01:16:54.951
I knew you'd pick
the safest route for everybody.

01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:57.820
I've studied your style.

01:16:59.197 --> 01:17:01.699
I know you always focused
your detonation.

01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:07.997
So I knew...

01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:13.711
that if I was facing Tomas,
right in front of him, like this...

01:17:14.504 --> 01:17:16.316
A little bit closer, like this...

01:17:20.927 --> 01:17:23.399
I knew I'd feel safe.

01:17:32.689 --> 01:17:35.608
Ahem. Excuse me.
Police are looking for these two people.

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:39.820
If you happen to see 'em,
call the number on the back, okay?

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:41.758
Hey, wait.

01:17:42.074 --> 01:17:43.967
I have seen them.

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:46.045
May?

01:17:49.404 --> 01:17:50.595
May?

01:18:26.175 --> 01:18:27.028
May?

01:18:29.621 --> 01:18:30.788
- Back from the dead.
- Ned.

01:18:32.165 --> 01:18:34.709
Jesus. Thank God.

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:36.780
You know,
I was just going to call you.

01:18:37.587 --> 01:18:40.766
About the funeral thing.
Look, I'm sorry, there's just...

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:43.186
You know, it was the only way
to really draw him out. And...

01:18:43.186 --> 01:18:48.732
it worked. I don't have to tell you. You know,
I used the attachment thing... and I got 'im.

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:51.809
Couldn't stay away from me. So?

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:54.061
I just wanna get
one thing straight here, May.

01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:58.107
- Yeah.
- You did all this to deliver him to me?

01:18:58.275 --> 01:18:59.260
Uh-huh.

01:19:00.026 --> 01:19:02.862
Ned, we had a deal.
I hold up my end of a deal.

01:19:03.363 --> 01:19:05.322
You're a classic, May.

01:19:05.490 --> 01:19:07.241
- Now, where is he?
- He's here.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:08.743
- I know he's here. Where?
- He's in the hotel.

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:12.455
- I know he's in the hotel. Where?
- Well, I got a key. I think it...

01:19:12.622 --> 01:19:15.124
- This key?
- No, no, no.

01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:17.752
Yeah. This key?

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:20.296
God, I mean, I do have a key.

01:19:20.464 --> 01:19:21.714
Ned, he's on a high floor.

01:19:21.882 --> 01:19:23.411
- I think it's like 10...
- Take her to the car.

01:19:23.411 --> 01:19:24.518
... or it's 11.

01:19:24.551 --> 01:19:26.719
- Go on.
- I left my purse in the room, Ned.

01:19:26.887 --> 01:19:30.222
- Shut up. Take her to the car.
- Ned, I have a couple of things I have...

01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:33.984
Stop yanking me around.
All right, all right.

01:19:35.395 --> 01:19:37.828
Oh, Harry,
you've gotta be kidding.

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:40.191
You're so adorable. No.

01:19:40.358 --> 01:19:43.444
He made me so nervous. Look, I just...
it'll take me one second.

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:44.960
Where can I go?

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.073
Great.

01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:53.996
Harry, listen...

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:56.962
- Harry, she'll call you back.
- Hey.

01:19:58.293 --> 01:19:59.418
Give me my phone.

01:20:04.007 --> 01:20:05.257
Room 1205.

01:20:16.686 --> 01:20:19.605
- Yeah.
- Leon's men are on their way up.

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:21.816
You set me up.

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:23.317
- Why?
- I did not.

01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:48.425
Come on, hit it. Okay, let's go, get out.
Come on, there's a fire. Let's go. Rush.

01:20:48.593 --> 01:20:49.996
Come on, come on.

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:54.075
Where you going? Hey, use the stairs.
This one's full. Get outta here. Get a new shirt.

01:21:34.806 --> 01:21:37.725
<i>We're sorry.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.</i>

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:42.322
<i>Please check the number and dial again
or call your operator to help you.</i>

01:21:49.195 --> 01:21:52.323
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.</i>

01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:55.910
<i>If you need help,
hang up and then dial your operator.</i>

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:09.965
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.</i>

01:22:10.133 --> 01:22:13.844
<i>If you need help,
hang up and then dial your operator.</i>

01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:15.271
No!

01:22:24.564 --> 01:22:27.775
Don't move.
Don't touch anything.

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.398
Come on, gimme your hand.

01:23:02.902 --> 01:23:03.942
Shit!

01:23:12.423 --> 01:23:14.123
Go! Go, go!

01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:26.583
- Hey, what's with the lights here?
- He's in here.

01:23:26.751 --> 01:23:28.335
- Security, get 'im.
- Hey!

01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:03.287
Come on, asshole. Come on.

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:33.942
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.945
<i>There's no cause
for alarm or panic.</i>

01:24:37.113 --> 01:24:40.157
<i>There has been an accident,
but there is currently no danger</i>

01:24:40.325 --> 01:24:43.467
<i>and no cause for alarm.</i>

01:25:09.479 --> 01:25:11.188
That's her.

01:25:11.689 --> 01:25:14.650
- Her who?
- That's the bitch that was banging Tomas.

01:25:14.818 --> 01:25:18.195
Her ID was faked.
Ray Quick is working for her.

01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:25.410
Alice and Stan Munro.

01:25:26.704 --> 01:25:28.247
What are you talkin' about?

01:25:29.249 --> 01:25:32.459
I was the kid your little boy missed
in the closet.

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:40.676
- That was a long time ago.
- Not to me.

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:44.138
Now I understand.

01:25:44.305 --> 01:25:46.431
Now I understand. You...

01:25:46.599 --> 01:25:48.767
You think...

01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:53.730
that my son Tomas gave the orders
for the killings. Yeah? Well, you are wrong.

01:25:53.898 --> 01:25:59.236
If anybody in this house
has power to give orders, it's me.

01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:01.572
You understand?
I give the orders.

01:26:01.739 --> 01:26:04.324
I give the orders
of who is killed

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:09.079
and who is not killed.
Is that understood?

01:26:09.247 --> 01:26:10.914
I need her, Joe...

01:26:11.082 --> 01:26:12.332
to get to Ray.

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:16.044
I have to make one more telephone call,
then you can have 'er. But I need her now.

01:26:16.713 --> 01:26:18.181
You sure?

01:26:18.923 --> 01:26:20.299
Joe, please.

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.408
Take the bitch.

01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:47.643
Show time.

01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:52.539
- Hello?
- It's me.

01:26:52.957 --> 01:26:56.293
Look, I'm sorry, Ray. I didn't know
they were coming. You gotta believe me.

01:26:56.461 --> 01:26:57.886
<i>I'll tell you what I believe.</i>

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.464
I believe
you're very good on the phone.

01:27:00.632 --> 01:27:01.851
Fuck.

01:27:02.967 --> 01:27:04.499
<i>I need to see you.</i>

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:09.290
What, me set up again?
No, I'll pass.

01:27:10.475 --> 01:27:13.560
<i>- I'm through taking risks.
- So that's it?</i>

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:16.563
We just walk away? Forever?

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:19.107
It's safer for everybody.

01:27:21.986 --> 01:27:25.239
Come on, Ray, I don't know
what... this relationship is about

01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:28.116
but there's one thing I know,
it's not based on safety.

01:27:28.284 --> 01:27:31.036
You're too much of an unknown.

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:35.207
<i>Adrian Hastings, May Munro.
Who the hell are you?</i>

01:27:37.835 --> 01:27:40.963
<i>- Do you remember the fountain?
- I remember.</i>

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:45.968
Do you remember touching me, Ray?

01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:49.697
<i>Do you remember my voice?</i>

01:27:50.598 --> 01:27:52.817
Not over the phone...

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:56.520
but carried on breath.

01:27:58.064 --> 01:27:59.106
<i>On you.</i>

01:28:00.733 --> 01:28:02.427
Near you.

01:28:04.779 --> 01:28:06.863
<i>Close enough to feel.</i>

01:28:07.031 --> 01:28:08.490
Why are you saying this to me?

01:28:10.201 --> 01:28:11.978
Because I have to.

01:28:14.038 --> 01:28:15.205
<i>Come on, Ray.</i>

01:28:16.749 --> 01:28:18.571
You gotta see me.

01:28:19.544 --> 01:28:20.585
Please?

01:28:22.046 --> 01:28:23.380
Please, baby?

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:35.984
Double M Seafood,
right now.

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:39.896
All right. And, Ray?

01:28:40.648 --> 01:28:41.982
I'm here.

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:44.735
Do you remember the note
our relationship ended on?

01:28:45.611 --> 01:28:48.071
The last thing I said to you?

01:28:48.781 --> 01:28:49.906
I remember everything.

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.242
I meant every word.

01:29:16.267 --> 01:29:17.559
You're going in alone, May.

01:29:18.269 --> 01:29:23.315
You know, if this is a trap,
I promise you, you're gonna die.

01:29:23.483 --> 01:29:24.949
But if he's in there...

01:29:25.068 --> 01:29:27.486
I want you to make 'im
feel safe... and secure...

01:29:28.154 --> 01:29:31.211
And I'll be listening...
on this microphone.

01:29:31.949 --> 01:29:34.951
The second I hear his voice,
we move in.

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:36.411
You understand?

01:29:36.746 --> 01:29:38.538
Now get out of the fucking car.

01:29:56.099 --> 01:30:00.060
This thing is all over, I could see us
spending some time together again.

01:30:00.645 --> 01:30:05.982
You know, you wash
the, uh, stink of Tomas and Ray off you...

01:30:06.442 --> 01:30:10.223
- you might clean up pretty good.
- Okay.

01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:19.204
Go ahead.

01:30:20.331 --> 01:30:22.833
And then you can go in
and get 'im yourself.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.668
I don't give a shit.

01:30:27.338 --> 01:30:29.297
Go on.

01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:32.008
Move.

01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:41.852
If she blinks...

01:30:42.812 --> 01:30:44.020
<i>kill 'er.</i>

01:31:09.338 --> 01:31:11.282
<i>Bad plan, Ned.</i>

01:31:11.716 --> 01:31:13.633
That's it, boys,
we got 'im. Move in.

01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:39.367
Go! Go, you chicken shits!

01:31:39.535 --> 01:31:42.871
What do you think, he's gonna
top that? Get in there!

01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:45.916
Watch the river!
Watch the river and the side streets.

01:31:46.083 --> 01:31:48.001
Fucking crabs.
Nice one, Raymond.

01:31:50.325 --> 01:31:51.305
Damn it.

01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:55.800
Assholes, watch the river.
Where are you, Raymond?

01:31:56.886 --> 01:31:59.179
All right, side one!

01:32:19.575 --> 01:32:22.880
<i>What, me set up again?
No, I'll pass.</i>

01:32:23.329 --> 01:32:24.516
What's that?

01:32:24.705 --> 01:32:26.188
Break it down.

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.468
Air brakes.

01:32:30.795 --> 01:32:32.128
<i>It's safer for everybody.</i>

01:32:32.296 --> 01:32:34.839
Complex sound, slightly muffled.

01:32:35.225 --> 01:32:38.009
People talking,
clamping down steps.

01:32:39.303 --> 01:32:40.637
A clapping shut.

01:32:41.347 --> 01:32:44.224
Voices... mechanical sounds...

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:47.894
- A hiss.
- People getting off a bus. Yes. Yes.

01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:51.982
See, you have to have an overview. It's people
getting off a bus. Are these sounds on both tapes?

01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:53.775
- Yes.
- Yes, I knew it. Okay, buses.

01:32:53.943 --> 01:32:56.653
We gotta have bus routes.
What do we have? Okay.

01:32:56.821 --> 01:33:00.574
He... uses pay phones,
but he gets there by bus.

01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:03.326
Oh, Ray,
you're always so precise.

01:33:03.494 --> 01:33:06.788
Let's say, he gets on a bus
wherever he lives and he...

01:33:06.956 --> 01:33:10.250
goes in both directions. Right? Which is
good counter-surveillance technique.

01:33:10.418 --> 01:33:13.878
And he takes the bus 20 to 25 minutes
in each direction. So we have...

01:33:14.213 --> 01:33:15.475
- Come on, come on.
- Four.

01:33:15.475 --> 01:33:17.465
Four, four and four.

01:33:17.633 --> 01:33:19.551
Here we go, triangulation.

01:33:19.719 --> 01:33:23.930
Three routes, that's it. Bingo. Okay, we wanna
have, uh, checks in five-minute intervals.

01:33:24.098 --> 01:33:25.682
- Right?
- How about the restaurants in the area?

01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:28.602
- Restaurants?
- He's gotta eat sometime.

01:33:29.604 --> 01:33:31.237
Try to remember. He would've
gotten off the bus,

01:33:31.237 --> 01:33:32.790
walked in alone,
maybe bought a pack of cigarettes.

01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:34.858
- Look at that face. Come on.
- I told you...

01:33:35.026 --> 01:33:37.444
we have a lot of regular customers,
but he ain't one of 'em.

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:40.753
- Look at that face again. Come on. Come on!
- Nothing.

01:33:41.991 --> 01:33:43.116
Hey, Henry.

01:33:44.994 --> 01:33:47.047
I forgot to tell you, we deliver.

01:34:07.266 --> 01:34:09.059
Now, there's a vision.

01:34:14.398 --> 01:34:18.255
- Good morning, stranger.
- I gotta go.

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:21.838
Where? I think we already wore out
our welcome at the Hilton.

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.830
I wanna stay with you.

01:34:32.458 --> 01:34:36.503
But it's not over for me.
Joe Leon ordered the hit.

01:34:37.546 --> 01:34:39.589
Let me get this right.

01:34:41.258 --> 01:34:44.302
You think that killing Joe Leon
is gonna make everything all right?

01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:46.429
Something has to.

01:34:48.766 --> 01:34:51.525
You did the job. I'm not asking
for your help.

01:34:51.525 --> 01:34:54.487
- I'll take care of it. I owe him.
- No!

01:34:55.439 --> 01:34:56.981
You owe her.

01:35:00.111 --> 01:35:02.278
Her. A whole life. Come 'ere.

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.865
Come 'ere.

01:35:13.999 --> 01:35:18.169
Put all this behind you now
or the past is gonna eat you alive.

01:35:18.337 --> 01:35:20.755
I know
what I'm talkin' about.

01:35:24.510 --> 01:35:28.409
I have to go.
Wish me luck.

01:35:28.806 --> 01:35:30.849
No.

01:35:39.734 --> 01:35:41.651
Come 'ere. 
You're not goin'.

01:36:26.572 --> 01:36:29.741
<i>Detonation sequence... primed.
Enter code.</i>

01:36:29.909 --> 01:36:30.950
Top o' the world, mom.

01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:34.120
<i>Controlled.</i>

01:36:34.288 --> 01:36:35.622
One, two, three.

01:36:45.925 --> 01:36:47.300
I'm afraid to ask.

01:36:47.468 --> 01:36:50.929
This place is rigged for controlled explosion
if the inner perimeter is breached.

01:36:51.096 --> 01:36:54.911
Each one of these lights is a pressure-mine
sequence. If one goes, they all go.

01:36:55.267 --> 01:36:56.559
- Where are they?
- Everywhere.

01:36:56.727 --> 01:37:00.438
But don't worry, they're not armed yet.
But if these lights turn red... worry.

01:37:10.282 --> 01:37:12.367
This is good.
Nice sneak attack.

01:37:12.535 --> 01:37:16.746
<i>Do not approach
the warehouse. Perimeter is armed.</i>

01:37:16.914 --> 01:37:19.165
Uh, please, cut the bullshit.

01:37:25.631 --> 01:37:27.841
That's a good one.
I taught 'im that.

01:37:30.177 --> 01:37:32.929
Nice sense of irony,
blowing up the Bomb Disposal unit.

01:37:33.097 --> 01:37:34.180
Nice work, Ray.

01:37:35.599 --> 01:37:36.766
<i>Warning.</i>

01:37:36.934 --> 01:37:39.811
<i>Gunfire will automatically
detonate B20s</i>

01:37:39.979 --> 01:37:42.981
<i>sufficient to destroy
two square miles.</i>

01:37:43.469 --> 01:37:45.143
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

01:37:45.818 --> 01:37:47.068
Go, go, go! To the left!

01:37:47.236 --> 01:37:48.945
Give me that.

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:55.201
Listen up. Anybody shoots,
anybody shoots, and I shoot them.

01:37:56.245 --> 01:37:59.622
This whole place is wired
and I'm gonna take 'im alive. You got that?

01:38:05.129 --> 01:38:06.296
Move back!

01:38:06.463 --> 01:38:07.775
Look out.

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:11.426
<i>Air unit, stand by.</i>

01:38:11.969 --> 01:38:13.140
Oh, that's new.

01:38:13.304 --> 01:38:15.179
How's that feel, ace?

01:38:16.307 --> 01:38:18.933
Don't shoot. Go!

01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:21.315
Fuck this amateur hour.

01:38:21.478 --> 01:38:24.439
<i>- Bravo Unit One, back up Three.</i>

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:33.072
You're crazy.

01:38:39.663 --> 01:38:42.665
All the highly trained professionals
in the world...

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:47.921
all the hardware...

01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:50.328
all the technology,
 what do you got?

01:38:51.508 --> 01:38:53.136
Nothin'.

01:38:53.844 --> 01:38:56.023
You gotta do everything yourself.

01:38:57.264 --> 01:38:58.782
And why?

01:39:00.225 --> 01:39:02.795
You can't get good help
these days.

01:39:04.188 --> 01:39:06.105
<i>Side 5, report in.</i>

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:08.816
<i>On command...</i>

01:39:17.159 --> 01:39:20.203
<i>Sir, we have a problem
with possible booby traps...</i>

01:39:29.046 --> 01:39:31.450
A surprise for you, Ray.

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:36.552
<i>Inner perimeter breech, Ray.</i>

01:39:37.054 --> 01:39:38.596
Right. It's set. Let's go.

01:39:44.395 --> 01:39:47.146
<i>- Final destruction sequence initiated.
- Don't move.</i>

01:39:47.314 --> 01:39:49.732
- I'll lead you through the pressure pads.
- Evacuate.

01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:51.067
Ray?

01:39:53.404 --> 01:39:55.655
I'm sorry.
Should I have knocked?

01:39:58.867 --> 01:40:00.159
All right, Ray.

01:40:01.495 --> 01:40:02.578
You lose, I win.

01:40:05.082 --> 01:40:08.668
Eh-eh! She's hot, Ray.
Semtex, sprayed with nitro.

01:40:09.086 --> 01:40:12.255
Cigarette case.
Honest Injun, take a look.

01:40:13.757 --> 01:40:15.425
Just a peek, no touch.

01:40:21.015 --> 01:40:26.394
And May, you might ask yourself
"Why is today my time to die?"

01:40:30.357 --> 01:40:33.109
Take it out. Slowly.

01:40:34.236 --> 01:40:36.112
Slowly.

01:40:37.614 --> 01:40:38.948
Open it up.

01:40:41.577 --> 01:40:44.203
Everybody deserves to die.

01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:48.374
Ask God.
He kills across the board.

01:40:50.502 --> 01:40:52.128
So why shouldn't I?

01:40:53.672 --> 01:40:54.915
Bye.

01:40:56.425 --> 01:40:58.667
And here's a tip
I learned from you, Ray.

01:40:58.667 --> 01:41:00.670
It's a focused detonation.
Only she blows.

01:41:00.705 --> 01:41:02.722
- Pretty nifty, huh?
- Don't move it.

01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:05.683
The mercury switch.
Any change in attitude or altitude, it goes.

01:41:05.851 --> 01:41:07.643
Got it.

01:41:07.811 --> 01:41:09.937
Anyway, Ray, she's dead already.
What I need...

01:41:10.802 --> 01:41:13.566
what I need is to take you alive
because, you see, my boss...

01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:15.809
he wants to look in your eyes
when you die.

01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:18.071
- Okay?
- Sick fuck.

01:41:18.614 --> 01:41:19.947
I'm touched, really.

01:41:20.115 --> 01:41:21.616
What happened to us, Ray?

01:41:23.494 --> 01:41:25.119
We were...

01:41:26.121 --> 01:41:27.246
We were good together.

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:31.793
You were the rigger
and I was the trigger.

01:41:34.588 --> 01:41:36.384
You shouldn't have taken me down.

01:41:37.174 --> 01:41:39.309
Because now, you fuck...

01:41:42.471 --> 01:41:45.632
Ohh, I see you're still into
the old memories, Ray.

01:41:46.975 --> 01:41:49.402
Well, that's what always does you in,
you know, memories.

01:41:49.853 --> 01:41:51.940
It's that tryin' to save the innocent.

01:41:53.148 --> 01:41:55.316
You know your problem, Ray?

01:41:56.443 --> 01:41:57.693
You're too sentimental.

01:41:57.861 --> 01:42:00.530
There's nothing wrong
with being sentimental.

01:42:01.532 --> 01:42:04.200
Sometimes you could save your ass.

01:42:07.704 --> 01:42:10.498
- Fuck me.
- Here's a tip: No fail-safe.

01:42:10.666 --> 01:42:11.966
Pressure pads.

01:42:19.591 --> 01:42:22.093
<i>Thirty seconds
to total destruction.</i>

01:42:22.261 --> 01:42:26.013
All right. Now, slide it to me.

01:42:30.894 --> 01:42:33.000
<i>Twenty-five seconds.</i>

01:42:33.355 --> 01:42:38.423
It's all right. Just do it, May.
Slide your hands out.

01:42:39.736 --> 01:42:40.736
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

01:42:45.784 --> 01:42:48.536
Now get the hell outta here.
Straight down the right side.

01:42:48.704 --> 01:42:50.746
Not without you.

01:42:51.331 --> 01:42:53.833
<i>- Fifteen seconds.
- I'm right behind you.</i>

01:42:58.797 --> 01:43:01.090
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

01:43:04.428 --> 01:43:05.678
Oh, no!

01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:09.557
<i>- Five seconds.
- Come on! Come on!</i>

01:43:11.768 --> 01:43:13.186
<i>Three seconds.</i>

01:43:52.851 --> 01:43:54.185
Come on!

01:44:35.018 --> 01:44:36.686
Thank you.

01:44:46.863 --> 01:44:49.865
You are a kind God.

01:44:51.034 --> 01:44:52.827
Thank you.

01:45:18.061 --> 01:45:19.562
You bastarda!

01:45:32.409 --> 01:45:35.244
- How do you feel?
- Better.
