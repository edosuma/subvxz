WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:01.500
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.501 --> 00:03.768
No, he's a musician too. Classical.

00:03.770 --> 00:05.737
Well, maybe you're just
a little too buttoned up.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.572
Dude, you gotta come jam with us sometime.

00:07.574 --> 00:09.173
- Just think about it.
- Yeah, I know who you are.

00:09.175 --> 00:11.075
- You're Robert Quinn.
- As soon as I saw you I knew.

00:11.077 --> 00:12.676
You're my daughter. I brought you this.

00:12.678 --> 00:14.078
Just read it when you have the time.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.713
Dear Callie, My name is Sophia.

00:15.715 --> 00:18.416
I'm your sister. I would
really, really like to meet you

00:18.418 --> 00:19.850
and I hope you wanna meet me too.

00:19.852 --> 00:22.320
I'm sorry. You were way better than her.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.455
She only made the team because she's Latin.

00:24.457 --> 00:25.490
They have to have diversity.

00:25.492 --> 00:27.125
No, I like how independent you are.

00:27.127 --> 00:28.959
I just feel like sometimes it's
kinda like you're dating yourself.

00:28.961 --> 00:30.561
Like it doesn't even matter
whether I'm here or not.

00:30.563 --> 00:32.997
- Well, congrats. It doesn't anymore.
- Emma.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.499
- Emma.
- I know it's not true,

00:34.501 --> 00:36.033
but my dad won't let me
sleep over at your house

00:36.035 --> 00:37.934
because he thinks you're gay.

00:40.971 --> 00:44.407
Oh, I've got some people coming over
to play in the garage again tonight.

00:44.409 --> 00:46.510
- Is that still cool?
- Yeah, of course. How's it going?

00:46.512 --> 00:48.111
Good. We're still trying
to find our rhythm.

00:48.113 --> 00:49.746
What's the matter?

00:49.748 --> 00:52.449
Nothing. The girls on the dance team.

00:52.451 --> 00:54.851
They keep posted pics of them
hanging out together without me.

00:54.853 --> 00:55.952
How come they didn't invite me?

00:55.954 --> 00:57.454
Maybe because you're E-stalking them?

00:57.456 --> 00:59.022
- I am not!
- Mariana, please...

00:59.024 --> 01:00.690
would you please help your siblings here?

01:00.692 --> 01:02.058
When do we get to hear something?

01:02.060 --> 01:04.861
Uh... I don't think inviting
my moms to band practice

01:04.863 --> 01:07.630
is the best idea this early
in the creative process,

01:07.632 --> 01:09.098
but I'll let you know
when the single drops?

01:09.100 --> 01:12.168
I see. You know what? He doesn't
think that we are cool enough.

01:12.170 --> 01:14.077
I will have you know that your mother and I

01:14.078 --> 01:15.078
used to listen to rock
and roll all the time.

01:15.173 --> 01:16.505
Oh yeah? Like who?

01:16.507 --> 01:19.542
- Like Springsteen and REM...
- Right.

01:19.544 --> 01:22.011
and... Bananarama.

01:22.013 --> 01:24.047
I can't believe you just said that.

01:24.049 --> 01:27.483
I'll have you know that I went
to a Nirvana concert, once.

01:28.586 --> 01:30.853
So, why'd you stop? Listening, I mean.

01:30.855 --> 01:34.222
Just... remember we used to
have dance parties all the time?

01:37.494 --> 01:39.961
I don't know. Guess we just... got busy.

01:39.963 --> 01:41.129
So what's the deal with this weekend?

01:41.131 --> 01:43.598
Are you guys still doing
on your babymoon thing?

01:43.600 --> 01:47.069
Actually, your grandmother had
a shuffle in her conference plans

01:47.071 --> 01:49.537
and she's not gonna be able
to come and stay with you guys.

01:49.539 --> 01:51.139
Yeah, so, I think the
babymoon's gonna have to wait.

01:51.141 --> 01:52.407
What's a babymoon?

01:52.409 --> 01:54.242
It's kind of like a honeymoon

01:54.244 --> 01:56.544
only instead of going
away after you get married,

01:56.546 --> 01:59.247
you go away after you get pregnant.

01:59.249 --> 02:01.027
Before the baby comes and
there's no more time for fun,

02:01.028 --> 02:02.910
or travel, or romance.

02:03.553 --> 02:05.587
Um, I think you guys should go anyway.

02:05.589 --> 02:08.356
We're old enough to
stay alone for one night.

02:08.358 --> 02:10.024
That's a very nice
offer, sweetie, thank you.

02:10.026 --> 02:11.326
But I don't think so.

02:11.328 --> 02:14.862
You know, we could put Brandon
and Callie in charge, honey.

02:14.864 --> 02:18.266
We could... uh, I don't... um...

02:18.268 --> 02:21.736
- I don't know that...
- Honey, we need this.

02:21.738 --> 02:23.738
It's just for one night.

02:26.208 --> 02:30.478
♪ Honey, drop the melodrama ♪

02:30.480 --> 02:35.115
♪ Tonight and do something crazy ♪

02:35.117 --> 02:37.183
♪ All right ♪

02:37.185 --> 02:41.555
♪ Won't you come my way ♪
♪ Won't you come my way ♪

02:41.557 --> 02:43.490
♪ All I see is your face... ♪

02:43.492 --> 02:45.726
What's going on? Lou, hold up.

02:45.728 --> 02:48.528
Uh, nothing, I'm sorry.

02:48.530 --> 02:51.398
I wonder if Lou's coming on a
little strong in the choruses.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.466
I'm sorry?

02:52.468 --> 02:54.334
Well, it's just that we're all

02:54.336 --> 02:56.002
in mezzo forte in that section,

02:56.004 --> 02:58.605
and I was wondering if maybe
you should just follow us?

02:58.607 --> 03:01.174
- Follow you?
- Yeah,

03:01.176 --> 03:04.110
I mean, you don't wanna give
it all away from the top, right?

03:04.112 --> 03:07.147
You gotta start with some pianos...

03:07.149 --> 03:08.181
Pianos?

03:08.183 --> 03:12.551
Yeah. Piano means softly, plain.

03:12.553 --> 03:16.622
Gee, my favorite kind of
rock and roll, soft and plain.

03:16.624 --> 03:17.957
Maybe he has a point, Lou.

03:17.959 --> 03:21.327
Yeah, and maybe I know how
to sing my songs. In my band.

03:28.270 --> 03:29.535
Ok, fine.

03:29.537 --> 03:31.771
Tomorrow night's open mic at Groundspace.

03:31.773 --> 03:35.008
I will put the word out to a few
friends, and we can let them weigh in.

03:35.010 --> 03:37.143
I actually can't do tomorrow night,

03:37.145 --> 03:39.846
my moms are out of town
and I'm kind of in charge.

03:39.848 --> 03:41.314
Ok, so we'll just do it here.

03:41.316 --> 03:44.184
Well, I can't just have people over.

03:44.186 --> 03:45.885
Shocker.

03:48.789 --> 03:51.790
Ok, yeah, sure. But only a few people.

03:51.792 --> 03:53.658
You're the one in charge.

03:56.262 --> 03:58.363
One, two, three, four...

04:39.699 --> 04:40.145
Hey, wait up!

04:40.772 --> 04:43.706
Where you been? I was
looking for you at lunch.

04:45.342 --> 04:47.309
Is this about what my dad said?

04:47.311 --> 04:50.079
Because, you know, I don't
care if you're... you know.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.081
If that's what you are.

04:53.517 --> 04:54.583
Are you?

04:54.585 --> 04:57.687
What, gay? You can say it,

04:57.689 --> 04:59.622
it's not a bad word.

04:59.624 --> 05:01.090
But why do I have to be anything?

05:01.092 --> 05:02.792
- What do you mean?
- Why does everybody

05:02.794 --> 05:06.062
go around labeling people all
the time, putting us in boxes?

05:06.064 --> 05:09.131
- I don't get it.
- No, you're right. I'm sorry.

05:09.133 --> 05:11.333
I won't do that anymore.

05:11.335 --> 05:12.793
And what about your dad?

05:12.794 --> 05:14.635
He doesn't want us hanging out, right?

05:14.639 --> 05:15.638
He doesn't have to know.

05:17.507 --> 05:19.141
Yeah...

05:19.143 --> 05:20.609
I don't want to be anybody's secret.

05:20.611 --> 05:24.413
Tell your dad I said
it was nice knowing ya.

05:37.008 --> 05:39.143
Hey. You gonna be home tonight?

05:39.145 --> 05:41.312
Unfortunately, yes.

05:41.314 --> 05:44.315
Um, ok. It should be fun though.

05:44.317 --> 05:45.550
What should?

05:45.552 --> 05:48.786
Your brother's having people
over, to hear the band.

05:48.788 --> 05:50.722
He didn't tell you?

05:50.724 --> 05:53.558
No. Wait, we're having a party?!

05:53.560 --> 05:58.229
No, just a few people over,
listening to music. Low key.

05:58.231 --> 06:00.665
Got it. Right. Cool.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.299
Ok, so, see you tonight?

06:09.474 --> 06:13.142
Is this you? Cute.

06:13.144 --> 06:15.945
That's my half-sister.

06:18.249 --> 06:19.383
Wait, what?

06:19.385 --> 06:22.318
Mm-hmm. Her name's Sophia.

06:22.320 --> 06:25.455
She is fourteen and she wants to meet me.

06:25.457 --> 06:27.056
Holy hell...

06:29.627 --> 06:30.627
What did Jude think?

06:30.629 --> 06:32.328
Haven't told him.

06:32.330 --> 06:35.999
I don't know how he's gonna... take it.

06:36.001 --> 06:37.800
What about Stef and Lena? You tell them?

06:37.802 --> 06:38.801
Not yet.

06:40.904 --> 06:43.539
Well, how about I take
your mind off of it tonight?

06:44.674 --> 06:47.543
You're sweet, um... I can't.

06:47.545 --> 06:51.013
I have to be home,
like, right after school.

06:51.015 --> 06:52.548
Stef and Lena are going away for the night,

06:52.550 --> 06:54.517
so they left me and Brandon in charge.

06:54.519 --> 06:56.719
Can I come over?

06:56.721 --> 07:00.055
No guests allowed. I'm sorry.

07:00.057 --> 07:03.793
Hey girls, change of plans,
party at Mariana's tonight!

07:03.795 --> 07:06.360
- Awesome!
- Uh... sorry.

07:06.362 --> 07:08.763
Where'd you hear that
Mariana was throwing a party?

07:08.765 --> 07:10.899
From her.

07:19.742 --> 07:21.976
Let the babymoon begin!

07:28.651 --> 07:31.453
- Hmm.
- What?

07:31.455 --> 07:35.222
Uh, I don't know. Just seems a
little small, don't you think?

07:35.224 --> 07:39.560
Doesn't feel a little
claustrophobic to you?

07:39.562 --> 07:41.762
We should've asked for the upgrade.

07:41.764 --> 07:44.432
How much room do we need?

07:44.434 --> 07:45.799
All right, we should
call the kids, I think.

07:45.801 --> 07:47.634
- Honey, you just called them from the car.
- What...

07:47.636 --> 07:51.705
The whole point of us being
here is so we can unplug.

07:51.707 --> 07:54.275
I'm unplugged, I'm unplugged.

07:54.277 --> 07:55.476
- No, no, no! Wait!
- What?

07:55.478 --> 07:57.211
Do you have any idea
how expensive that is?!

07:57.213 --> 08:00.046
Did you know that some hotels charge
if you just open up the fridge.

08:00.048 --> 08:01.448
Seriously?

08:01.450 --> 08:03.649
How about I go to the grocery
store that's just up the road

08:03.651 --> 08:05.785
and I'll grab us some snacks and some water

08:05.787 --> 08:08.221
I'm sure that Dana's gift
didn't include incidentals

08:08.223 --> 08:10.556
and we can't afford to splurge right now.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.327
What?

08:14.329 --> 08:15.828
I guess this wouldn't be
the best time to tell you

08:15.830 --> 08:17.663
about the couples massage I ordered?

08:20.534 --> 08:21.968
That's... that's fine.

08:21.970 --> 08:24.137
Sounds good. Can I get
you anything in particular?

08:24.139 --> 08:27.073
- Stef.
- It's fine. I want to. I want to.

08:27.075 --> 08:28.341
It'll give me a chance to call the kids.

08:28.343 --> 08:30.743
and I'll get the little
crackery thingys that you love.

08:30.745 --> 08:32.778
Just... I'll be back before you know it.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.246
You just... you sit there and relax.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.734
You told people we were
having a party tonight?

08:38.736 --> 08:40.669
Don't look at me... it was Brandon's idea.

08:40.672 --> 08:43.173
What? Why would Brandon be telling
people we're having a party?

08:43.174 --> 08:46.442
OK, it's not a party. I'm
just inviting a few people over

08:46.444 --> 08:48.678
to, you know, hear the band practice.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.281
No. You heard Moms. We're not
supposed to have any people over.

08:51.283 --> 08:54.050
Hey, all I did was invite the dance girls.

08:54.052 --> 08:56.152
Who are inviting people, who
are probably inviting people...

08:56.154 --> 08:57.853
Well, that's not my fault.

08:57.855 --> 09:01.390
I don't care who's fault it is, but you
both have to call them all and cancel.

09:01.392 --> 09:05.594
No. Last I checked, I
don't take orders from you.

09:05.596 --> 09:08.197
Well, Stef and Lena left me in charge.

09:08.199 --> 09:09.431
- So...
- No.

09:09.433 --> 09:11.300
They left us both in charge.

09:11.302 --> 09:13.736
Exactly, which is why we should both...

09:13.738 --> 09:16.806
You know, it's our babymoon, too, you guys!

09:16.808 --> 09:18.340
There's gonna be a baby.

09:18.342 --> 09:22.211
Which means this is the last time
our moms are ever go away again.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.646
Do you hear what I'm saying? Ever. Again.

09:24.648 --> 09:27.016
Which means that this is our
only chance to have a party.

09:27.018 --> 09:29.018
- We're having a party?
- No!

09:30.319 --> 09:31.753
Come on, you guys, seriously.

09:31.755 --> 09:33.554
You guys wanna get in more trouble?

09:33.556 --> 09:34.889
We only get in trouble if we get caught.

09:34.891 --> 09:36.658
So, we don't get caught.

09:38.360 --> 09:42.631
Well, I'm not gonna have any part of this.

09:42.633 --> 09:45.366
Stef and Lena said that nobody
comes inside the house except for us.

09:45.368 --> 09:48.136
So, nobody is going to
step inside this house.

09:48.138 --> 09:50.304
Ok. We'll have the party
in the backyard then.

09:50.306 --> 09:52.707
Fine. But if you get caught, that's on you.

09:52.709 --> 09:55.110
Jude and I are gonna
follow the rules, right?

09:55.112 --> 09:56.344
Fine.

09:59.148 --> 10:00.615
Ok.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.519
Who're you calling?

10:04.521 --> 10:07.888
Uh, Wyatt.

10:07.890 --> 10:09.923
If we're going to be keeping
people out of the house,

10:09.925 --> 10:13.293
- we're gonna need help.
- Isn't that breaking the rules?

10:13.295 --> 10:14.528
No, it's...

10:14.530 --> 10:19.533
sometimes you gotta break
the rules to keep them.

10:19.535 --> 10:25.372
In that case, can I ask Maddie
to come? You know, to help.

10:29.071 --> 10:31.104
Yes, we're fine, Mom.

10:31.106 --> 10:33.874
We actually just ordered some
pizzas for dinner tonight.

10:33.876 --> 10:36.276
So... Callie?

10:36.278 --> 10:39.612
Oh, you know, she's, uh,
holdin' down the fort.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.482
So while everyone's
throwing down out there,

10:43.484 --> 10:44.884
we're just gonna hole up in here?

10:44.886 --> 10:46.653
Yep. That's the plan.

10:46.655 --> 10:49.923
Gotcha. But if I were to
step outside, you know,

10:49.925 --> 10:52.191
for a little bit, that would be... ?

10:52.193 --> 10:54.961
Not cool. You're only here
because you're my bouncer.

10:54.963 --> 10:58.097
Security. Yeah, I didn't call
you over so you could have fun.

10:58.099 --> 11:00.033
Yeah. No risk in that.

11:00.035 --> 11:02.935
Look, I'm not taking any chances, ok?

11:02.937 --> 11:05.271
Remember how destroyed your house
got after the foreclosure party?

11:05.273 --> 11:06.672
Yeah, but that was kinda the point.

11:08.641 --> 11:10.609
Oh, wow.

11:10.611 --> 11:13.479
I feel like I just walked into
the house that boring built.

11:13.481 --> 11:15.847
You need something? Kinda busy.

11:15.849 --> 11:19.017
Uh, what are people supposed to do
when they need to use the bathroom?

11:19.019 --> 11:21.019
Guess that's your problem, isn't it?

11:21.021 --> 11:25.857
Ok. So, people are just gonna pee all
over Moms' flowers, is that what you want?

11:25.859 --> 11:29.461
No. What I want is to prevent
this house... our house

11:29.463 --> 11:32.830
from being, I dunno, vandalized.

11:32.832 --> 11:36.101
Vandalized? Don't you think
you're over-reacting a little bit?

11:36.103 --> 11:39.571
People get drunk and things
get destroyed, Brandon.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.073
God, when did you become so anal?

11:42.075 --> 11:43.341
When did you become such an ass?

11:43.343 --> 11:47.378
Ok, um... a suggestion.

11:47.380 --> 11:50.948
What if you let people use the
bathroom just off the kitchen?

11:53.685 --> 11:54.685
I'm just trying to help.

11:57.022 --> 11:59.423
Ok. But one at a time.

11:59.425 --> 12:01.925
And we are going to monitor it all night.

12:03.294 --> 12:05.395
- We are?
- Mm-hmm.

12:05.397 --> 12:08.865
It was your idea. Or are we
not trying to help anymore?

12:08.867 --> 12:13.770
Fine. If that's how you guys want to
spend your night. Sounds like a plan.

12:19.777 --> 12:22.579
- What?
- I've never seen you two act like that before.

12:22.581 --> 12:24.414
Like what?

12:24.416 --> 12:26.517
Brother and sister.

12:31.756 --> 12:34.323
Thanks for letting Chelsea come. My
parents wouldn't let me come alone.

12:34.325 --> 12:37.560
Can I see your dog? I love dogs.

12:37.562 --> 12:40.263
Oh. Um, we don't have a dog.

12:40.265 --> 12:43.066
Callie thinks it'll keep
people out of our moms' bedroom,

12:43.068 --> 12:45.268
just in case they get inside the house.

12:45.270 --> 12:47.570
So... is Connor coming?

12:48.739 --> 12:53.910
No. He's at his dad's for the weekend. Why?

12:53.912 --> 12:55.045
Do you like him?

12:55.047 --> 12:57.513
- I don't.
- Shut up!

12:57.515 --> 13:00.817
It's not like I'm the only one with
a crush on someone in our class...

13:00.819 --> 13:03.053
Oh, my God. I'm gonna kill you. Come on.

13:10.661 --> 13:13.029
So, where you from?

13:13.031 --> 13:16.799
- Serbia.
- Ahh. Nice.

13:16.801 --> 13:19.034
How long have you been in this country?

13:19.036 --> 13:21.804
Uh, about ten years.

13:21.806 --> 13:23.972
Yeah? What made you come to America?

13:23.974 --> 13:28.077
- You have family here?
- I did. But I came to start my own.

13:28.079 --> 13:30.779
Wow, that's very brave
of you. Do you have kids?

13:30.781 --> 13:34.316
- Yes, one. You?
- Mmm.

13:34.318 --> 13:35.951
Five.

13:35.953 --> 13:39.654
This is the first night that
they are staying home alone.

13:39.656 --> 13:44.459
Wow. So is this a girl's
getaway from your husbands, then?

13:44.461 --> 13:48.296
Uh, actually, we're a couple.

13:48.298 --> 13:52.634
Hence the couple's massage?

13:52.636 --> 13:57.606
Oh... oh. Nice.

14:01.645 --> 14:03.345
Hey, ladies!

14:03.347 --> 14:07.014
Um, what's with all the signs?
Are we not allowed in the house?

14:07.016 --> 14:10.084
Oh. We just had the
floors redone, actually.

14:10.086 --> 14:11.986
So, no one can walk on them.

14:13.088 --> 14:14.421
Besides, it's so nice out.

14:14.423 --> 14:16.790
It's kinda chilly, actually.

14:16.792 --> 14:19.226
Are there, like, outdoor
heaters or anything?

14:19.228 --> 14:22.929
Ah, no. But some of the
seniors did bring beer.

14:26.234 --> 14:30.437
So listen, Hayley's douche of a
boyfriend dumped her this afternoon,

14:30.439 --> 14:32.606
so she's super vulnerable right now.

14:32.608 --> 14:35.142
Oh, my God, that's terrible.

14:35.144 --> 14:36.443
Is there anything I can do?

14:36.445 --> 14:38.379
No. We just need to keep an eye on her.

14:38.381 --> 14:39.813
Make sure she doesn't drink too much.

14:39.815 --> 14:42.182
We can't have her breaking
the code of excellence tonight.

14:42.184 --> 14:44.117
The code of what?

14:44.119 --> 14:46.853
Right, I forgot. Since we haven't
really hung out socially before,

14:46.855 --> 14:49.122
you should know, we have a few rules.

14:49.124 --> 14:50.657
Ok...

14:50.659 --> 14:52.692
We all stick to one drink maximum.

14:52.694 --> 14:55.361
We don't dress like sluts.
We don't hook up with randos.

14:55.363 --> 14:58.098
And if there's dancing, we don't
use any of our patent moves,

14:58.100 --> 14:59.532
those are exclusive to the team.

14:59.534 --> 15:03.103
And if anybody breaks the
code, they're kicked off.

15:03.105 --> 15:04.771
But thanks for having us over!

15:10.912 --> 15:12.445
Hey, uh, where is she?

15:12.447 --> 15:14.547
You don't think she'd,
like, bail on us, do you?

15:14.549 --> 15:18.651
Nah, it's just Lou... this is
how she rolls. She'll be here.

15:23.424 --> 15:26.793
Hey, man. Can I have a sip?

15:30.531 --> 15:32.498
- What the... ?
- What's wrong with you?!

15:32.500 --> 15:34.667
Get outta here. Go.

15:38.673 --> 15:40.940
Yeah, toilet won't flush.

15:40.942 --> 15:44.043
Great. And thank you for telling
us that after you used it.

15:44.045 --> 15:45.712
You're welcome!

15:45.714 --> 15:49.215
Well, don't let anyone in.
I'm gonna go get a plunger.

15:54.922 --> 15:56.621
Hey. Is Jude here?

15:56.623 --> 16:00.893
Um, upstairs. Hurry. Hurry!

16:00.895 --> 16:03.896
See, this is why I didn't
want anyone using the bathroom.

16:06.499 --> 16:09.000
Nope.

16:09.002 --> 16:11.169
I take it back, that is why.

16:13.906 --> 16:16.475
Ok, that brings the
count to two hand-holds,

16:16.477 --> 16:18.276
three kisses, one butt-grab,

16:18.278 --> 16:21.279
and one "so deep it looked like he
was gonna eat her head" make out.

16:21.281 --> 16:26.418
Ok, I'm bored. This is worse
than when my dad watches golf.

16:26.420 --> 16:31.055
Oh. I don't know... that ping
pong game looked kinda funny.

16:31.057 --> 16:34.459
Well, maybe we should play a game, too.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.461
I could be into that.

16:36.463 --> 16:39.830
Oh, uh, ok. I'll go check the game closet?

16:39.832 --> 16:43.067
What about... spin the bottle?

16:43.069 --> 16:47.939
Um... we don't have a bottle.

16:47.941 --> 16:49.774
There's an app for that.

16:51.643 --> 16:53.211
Well, there are only three of us.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.748
- Hey.
- Hey!

16:57.750 --> 17:00.018
- What are you... ?
- I told my dad I wanted to come over.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.986
And he said it was ok?

17:01.988 --> 17:04.722
I didn't ask him if it was ok.

17:07.326 --> 17:09.093
So, you guys are having a party?

17:09.095 --> 17:12.730
We are... now that there are four of us.

17:23.409 --> 17:25.175
Sorry. I didn't see anyone was in here.

17:25.176 --> 17:27.511
Have you seen a cooler anywhere?

17:27.512 --> 17:30.781
Hey, are you ok?

17:35.687 --> 17:38.422
My boyfriend and I broke up.

17:41.426 --> 17:44.562
Seriously? That sucks.

17:44.564 --> 17:48.064
For what it's worth my girlfriend
just broke up with me too, so...

17:48.066 --> 17:49.398
I get it.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.667
Emma?

17:50.669 --> 17:53.870
Well, that was dumb of her.

17:53.872 --> 17:55.805
You're hot.

17:55.807 --> 17:58.040
I could say the same about you.

18:02.346 --> 18:04.213
So, why did this idiot break up with you?

18:04.215 --> 18:07.249
He said it's because I was too needy.

18:07.251 --> 18:08.918
But, honestly?

18:08.920 --> 18:11.654
I think it's just because he
wanted to hook up with older girls.

18:11.656 --> 18:13.556
He's in college.

18:15.726 --> 18:17.159
What about you?

18:17.161 --> 18:18.795
Well, we weren't really a good match.

18:18.797 --> 18:20.196
So...

18:23.701 --> 18:26.068
I probably look like such a mess right now.

18:27.237 --> 18:28.937
Is my mascara running?

18:30.072 --> 18:31.239
A little.

18:32.709 --> 18:34.042
- Will you get it?
- Here.

18:55.974 --> 18:57.209
Uh, toilet's out of order.

18:57.211 --> 18:58.543
What about our bathroom?

18:58.545 --> 18:59.944
No. No one goes upstairs.

18:59.946 --> 19:02.581
What about if I like just
pee in the kitchen sink?

19:02.583 --> 19:05.450
I mean... sure?

19:05.452 --> 19:09.053
All right, fine. Five minutes
but just her, OK? No one else.

19:14.127 --> 19:16.794
Hey! No, no, no. Take it outside!

19:19.765 --> 19:23.400
Ok, so you have to kiss
whoever the bottle points to.

19:23.402 --> 19:26.738
Those are the rules. Maddie, you're first.

19:36.181 --> 19:37.749
Are you ready?

19:37.751 --> 19:39.717
Yeah.

19:42.354 --> 19:46.123
Ok, who's next! Jude?

19:46.125 --> 19:50.594
Um, sure, just... gimme two secs?

20:13.685 --> 20:17.554
Oh! Sorry, I didn't
know anyone was in here.

20:17.556 --> 20:20.556
It's ok. You gotta go? It's all yours.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.433
Psst...

20:31.568 --> 20:33.736
What's... going on?

20:33.738 --> 20:36.372
I don't think your
friend's feeling very well.

20:50.854 --> 20:52.522
Hey! Off the swing!

20:52.524 --> 20:55.825
It's not a playground!

21:07.103 --> 21:10.172
- Where's Kaitlyn?
- Um... she already came down.

21:10.174 --> 21:12.442
- You didn't see her?
- No.

21:12.444 --> 21:14.444
Hmm. That's weird.

21:18.248 --> 21:20.082
Wait here.

22:08.364 --> 22:09.964
Whooo!

22:09.966 --> 22:13.034
- I like this ride!
- Yeah, well, ride's over.

22:13.036 --> 22:16.170
- Come on, we gotta go downstairs.
- Aw, you're no fun.

22:16.172 --> 22:18.039
Yep. Been hearing that all night. Come on.

22:18.041 --> 22:19.974
- Let's go.
- Ok.

22:23.780 --> 22:25.579
- Wait.
- What?

22:25.581 --> 22:29.350
- Wait, wait, wait.
- No, no, no, no, no.

22:36.159 --> 22:38.726
Hey, they've got lesbian porn.

22:38.728 --> 22:41.262
How does Breakfast On Tiffany sound?

22:41.264 --> 22:45.233
That sounds horrifying.

22:45.235 --> 22:47.802
Oh, come on, it'll help get us in the mood.

22:47.804 --> 22:53.007
Please. No bigger turn off than two
straight girls in stilettos pretending,

22:53.009 --> 22:55.843
for men, that they're hot for each other.

22:55.845 --> 22:57.377
Gimme a break.

22:59.448 --> 23:01.214
Ok.

23:06.855 --> 23:09.089
So how was your massage? Was it good?

23:09.091 --> 23:12.759
- It was pretty good.
- Yeah? Cool.

23:12.761 --> 23:16.596
How about you, how was
your interview with Inka?

23:16.598 --> 23:19.732
- My what?
- You seemed more interested in her life story

23:19.734 --> 23:21.335
than anything I've had to say lately.

23:21.337 --> 23:22.869
I was just making conversation.

23:22.871 --> 23:25.572
During a couples massage?

23:25.574 --> 23:27.474
Yeah, well, as soon as she heard we were

23:27.476 --> 23:30.043
a couple'a lesbians that
shut her up, didn't it?

23:36.217 --> 23:37.250
Where are you going?

23:37.252 --> 23:38.751
I'm gonna take a bath.

23:49.830 --> 23:52.631
I'm so sorry. I had no
idea how drunk she was.

23:52.633 --> 23:54.700
Just tell her friends that
she came with to take her home.

23:54.702 --> 23:57.736
I can't do that. None of
the girls on the dance team

23:57.738 --> 23:59.372
can see her like this, she
can get kicked off the team.

23:59.374 --> 24:01.340
- Why?
- Because of the code.

24:01.342 --> 24:03.642
- Code?
- Yeah, the code. You're not allowed...

24:03.644 --> 24:06.879
Actually, I don't care. Just
tell Wyatt to take her home.

24:06.881 --> 24:08.381
Ok, come on.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.519
I'm looking for my son, Connor.

24:14.521 --> 24:15.987
Are Jude's parents even here?

24:15.989 --> 24:18.056
Oh yeah, yeah. They're... they're out back.

24:18.058 --> 24:19.324
Well, is Connor here?

24:19.326 --> 24:20.691
You know, I don't know.

24:20.693 --> 24:23.128
Well, you mind letting
me go take a look around?

24:23.130 --> 24:24.129
Wha's happening?

24:26.765 --> 24:28.033
Stay.

24:33.705 --> 24:36.474
Uh, Connor's dad is here!

24:36.476 --> 24:40.345
Wait, why would Connor's dad
be here? Connor's not here.

24:45.784 --> 24:48.653
Ok, Connor, your turn.

24:56.795 --> 24:57.795
We don't have to kiss, do we?

24:57.797 --> 24:59.864
Well, those are the rules.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.534
Fine.

25:03.536 --> 25:05.436
No, this is dumb.

25:05.438 --> 25:07.371
- We should stop.
- No, it's cool.

25:07.373 --> 25:08.739
Let's just do it.

25:13.078 --> 25:14.378
Connor, your dad's here!

25:14.380 --> 25:16.547
Oh, my God, he cannot find me here.

25:16.549 --> 25:17.347
Why not?

25:18.784 --> 25:20.250
I snuck out.

25:21.553 --> 25:23.320
I've actually only been
up here a couple of times,

25:23.322 --> 25:25.555
so I can't...

25:30.995 --> 25:33.763
- Where's Connor?
- I dunno.

25:33.765 --> 25:35.531
I thought he wasn't allowed to come over.

25:35.533 --> 25:38.367
I'm just hanging with my girls.

25:46.043 --> 25:48.945
Hey, where have you
been? This was your idea.

25:48.947 --> 25:51.781
And in case you've forgotten,
I'm risking my ass to do this.

25:51.783 --> 25:53.917
Cool it, Beethoven.
We'll start in a minute.

25:55.285 --> 25:57.386
Well, contrary to what you might think,

25:57.388 --> 25:59.756
you're not talented
enough to make people wait.

25:59.758 --> 26:02.225
Really?

26:02.227 --> 26:03.726
Well, contrary to what you might think,

26:03.728 --> 26:04.994
you're not a member of this band

26:04.996 --> 26:07.630
and we don't need you or
your big fat classical ego.

26:07.632 --> 26:08.797
Well, then why are we even doing this?

26:08.799 --> 26:13.436
You know what, we're not. Peace.

26:17.874 --> 26:19.808
Ok. You need to get everybody
out of the house now.

26:19.810 --> 26:21.677
How am I supposed to do that, Callie?

26:21.679 --> 26:22.845
- I can't just...
- Play.

26:22.847 --> 26:24.447
Ok. That's why they're all here, isn't it?

26:24.449 --> 26:26.582
So if you start playing they
will come outside and listen.

26:26.584 --> 26:28.184
Well, Lou just bailed, so I...

26:28.186 --> 26:30.319
So play without her,
ok? But play something,

26:30.321 --> 26:32.955
or I swear I'll call the police
and shut this party down myself!

26:44.826 --> 26:46.227
Mind if I join you?

26:50.232 --> 26:53.801
Listen, I thought about
what you said and...

26:53.803 --> 26:56.371
you're right.

26:56.373 --> 26:59.407
We should watch Breakfast On Tiffany.

27:03.778 --> 27:06.447
You know what, I think...

27:06.449 --> 27:07.848
we should just go home.

27:10.052 --> 27:11.252
All right, what's wrong?

27:11.254 --> 27:13.421
We need to connect.

27:13.423 --> 27:16.457
- I am trying.
- No, you're not.

27:16.459 --> 27:19.693
What do you want me to do?

27:19.695 --> 27:22.363
I want you to talk to me.

27:22.365 --> 27:25.332
About something other
than money or the kids.

27:25.334 --> 27:27.167
Why don't you talk to me?

27:27.169 --> 27:29.603
Because half the time I really
don't think you're listening.

27:32.407 --> 27:34.274
So, when I don't talk, it's my fault.

27:34.276 --> 27:36.243
And when you don't talk it's my fault, too.

27:36.245 --> 27:37.978
I get it. It's all on me.

27:37.980 --> 27:40.648
I'm the one failing in this relationship.

27:40.650 --> 27:41.749
I didn't say that.

27:41.751 --> 27:42.983
Well, that's how it feels.

27:51.927 --> 27:54.161
Ok, back downstairs. Now!

27:54.163 --> 27:55.963
- Go.
- All right.

27:55.965 --> 27:58.699
Come on, let's go. Whatever.

28:03.571 --> 28:06.973
Hey, I thought you left.

28:06.975 --> 28:09.375
That's what Brandon said anyway.

28:09.377 --> 28:11.177
Brandon.

28:11.179 --> 28:13.680
He always been such a pompous ass?

28:13.682 --> 28:16.916
You know, he acts like he's
doing us some big frickin' favor.

28:18.351 --> 28:20.019
Guess all these...

28:20.021 --> 28:22.655
ribbons and trophies have
really gone to his head?

28:22.657 --> 28:24.891
Brandon's not pompous.

28:24.893 --> 28:26.693
So he's just an ass?

28:28.629 --> 28:32.098
You know, to be honest, I'm
surprised this didn't go to his head.

28:32.100 --> 28:35.501
He was brilliant. Like,
really, majorly brilliant.

28:35.503 --> 28:37.837
He even got into the junior symphony.

28:37.839 --> 28:39.472
Was brilliant?

28:39.474 --> 28:42.475
Yeah, he... got beaten up.

28:42.477 --> 28:46.412
His hand was shattered
and he lost all this.

28:46.414 --> 28:50.516
He'll never play classical
piano again, not like he used to.

28:52.519 --> 28:56.688
Brandon's not doing you a
favor. You're doing him one.

29:16.123 --> 29:18.156
Hey, has anyone seen Kaitlyn?

29:18.158 --> 29:19.924
Anyone?

29:19.926 --> 29:22.026
Sing something already!

29:24.297 --> 29:25.263
Dude, do you sing?

29:25.265 --> 29:27.732
I do, but...

29:27.734 --> 29:30.469
unless you want, like, a sonata,
I kinda only know one song.

29:30.471 --> 29:33.037

Oh yeah, I just...

32:12.518 --> 32:14.351
Got a condom?

32:14.353 --> 32:15.686
I'll be right back.

32:23.161 --> 32:25.596
You know, it's not all on you, ok?

32:26.765 --> 32:28.365
It's on me, too.

32:33.105 --> 32:38.342
When we got married, that
night and the next morning...

32:40.077 --> 32:42.879
... I felt like we were...

32:42.881 --> 32:44.680
... we were more in love than ever.

32:44.682 --> 32:49.552
Like we were just zipped
up in the same skin.

32:49.554 --> 32:53.189
I have never felt so happy...

32:55.059 --> 32:56.860
... so close to you.

32:59.063 --> 33:01.364
I want that feeling back.

33:02.566 --> 33:06.169
I want us back.

33:08.939 --> 33:13.309
I know that we can't always be as
connected as we were on our wedding night.

33:16.814 --> 33:19.482
But you can't blame me
for wishing that we could.

33:21.785 --> 33:24.419
And for missing you.

33:24.421 --> 33:26.354
I miss you too.

33:27.791 --> 33:28.957
And I'm sorry.

33:30.827 --> 33:34.396
I get so stressed and
worried about everything

33:34.398 --> 33:38.633
that I forget how important it is
for us to take care of each other.

33:38.635 --> 33:41.270
And I know we make these
promises all the time, but

33:41.272 --> 33:44.039
I'm gonna do better.
Ok? I'm gonna do better.

33:57.954 --> 33:59.721

I've never done anything like this before.

34:54.744 --> 34:58.679
I know people say that,
but I actually mean it.

35:02.417 --> 35:04.718
I haven't either.

35:04.720 --> 35:07.554
You're only the second guy I've been with.

35:09.858 --> 35:11.458
You're my second, too...

35:11.460 --> 35:14.561
... girl. I haven't been with any guys.

35:18.867 --> 35:22.503
So, can I call you? Can I have your number?

35:24.171 --> 35:25.171
I'd like that.

35:31.746 --> 35:33.447
- Hey, that was...
- No need to gloat.

35:33.449 --> 35:35.748
You were right.

35:39.352 --> 35:41.421
Dude, we have a serious problem.

35:41.423 --> 35:43.823
I just butt-dialed Mama and she
called me back and left a message.

35:43.825 --> 35:45.825
What should I do?

35:45.827 --> 35:50.430
Um, Moms are calling me.
What do I do? What do I do?!

35:50.432 --> 35:52.698
You guys, Lena is calling me.

35:52.700 --> 35:53.733
Answer it, now!

35:53.735 --> 35:55.601
Shut up!

35:57.738 --> 36:00.339
Hey, what's up?

36:00.341 --> 36:02.308
Nope, everyone's fine, why?

36:03.911 --> 36:05.845
Oh, really? Um...

36:05.847 --> 36:11.483
Well, we were just watching some dumb action
movie with the volume all the way up, so...

36:11.485 --> 36:14.019
maybe that's why nobody heard your calls.

36:15.521 --> 36:17.121
Yeah, no, everyone's here.

36:17.123 --> 36:18.457
- Hey.
- Hey, Moms!

36:18.459 --> 36:19.558
Hi, Moms!

36:19.560 --> 36:21.225
Where's Jude?

36:21.227 --> 36:24.395
Uh, Jude? Jude is... in the bathroom

36:24.397 --> 36:25.831
he'll be right back.

36:25.833 --> 36:26.898
What were you guys watching?

36:26.900 --> 36:29.935
It wasn't some violent
shoot 'em up, was it?

36:29.937 --> 36:32.337
No, no. It was um, it was just...

36:32.339 --> 36:34.339
The Fast And The 2 Fast 2 Furious.

36:36.175 --> 36:40.946
Hi, Moms. Sorry, I was
playing video games...

36:40.948 --> 36:44.015
in the bathroom. On Callie's phone.

36:44.017 --> 36:47.085
I thought we were
talking on Callie's phone?

36:47.087 --> 36:50.654
That's my phone, Jude! Geez. Ask next time!

36:51.890 --> 36:55.058
All right, don't go to
bed too late, you guys.

36:55.060 --> 36:56.126
We won't.

36:56.128 --> 36:57.361
Good night. Love you.

36:57.363 --> 36:59.096
Good night.

37:00.632 --> 37:02.199
- You think they bought it?
- They better have.

37:02.201 --> 37:05.202
Don't go thanking me
all at once, or anything.

37:05.204 --> 37:07.437
Well, at least nothing horrible happened...

37:07.439 --> 37:10.975
so can we just get everyone
out of here, please?

37:10.977 --> 37:12.910
Yep. You got it.

37:30.292 --> 37:32.760
Yeah, ten bucks says
they're having a party.

37:32.762 --> 37:35.163
Oh, so now we're just throwing money away?

37:35.165 --> 37:38.599
I'm serious. Yeah, ok. What do you think?

37:38.601 --> 37:42.937
I think they said everyone
was fine, so, everyone is fine.

37:42.939 --> 37:44.806
Fine.

37:44.808 --> 37:46.874
But you probably want to go home anyway?

37:46.876 --> 37:49.443
- So we can just pack up...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

37:49.445 --> 37:52.680
No, look, they are
obviously still alive, right?

37:52.682 --> 37:54.615
And if they're having a party,

37:54.617 --> 37:57.318
we will certainly find
out about it soon enough.

38:00.888 --> 38:04.491
In the meantime, why don't
we have one of our own?

38:05.894 --> 38:08.995
Kick off our shoes. Oh, oh. Just like that.

38:08.997 --> 38:10.631
And we'll dance... What?

38:10.633 --> 38:13.234
Our son basically signed
us up for AARP this morning.

38:13.236 --> 38:17.871
So we can either roll
with it, or we can dance.

38:19.741 --> 38:20.807
Come on.

38:50.138 --> 38:53.373
So? Was it "excellent", like you wanted?

38:54.942 --> 38:59.179
Meh... not really.

38:59.181 --> 39:02.014
I spent the whole night
cleaning up after everyone.

39:02.016 --> 39:03.616
I felt like such a mom.

39:03.618 --> 39:05.451
The dance girls?

39:05.453 --> 39:09.389
Yeah. I just... I don't get it.

39:09.391 --> 39:11.824
Kaitlyn made this huge deal
about all these rules they had.

39:11.826 --> 39:15.428
And then no one seemed to care when they
basically broke every single one of them.

39:15.430 --> 39:17.930
And if I hadn't been
babysitting them the whole night,

39:17.932 --> 39:19.666
I could've actually had a good time.

39:19.668 --> 39:23.235
Maybe I could've broken
a rule or two myself.

39:23.237 --> 39:25.638
That's a bad idea.

39:25.640 --> 39:29.776
Their rules, whatever they are,

39:29.778 --> 39:33.346
they still apply to you,
because of who you are.

39:35.415 --> 39:38.818
Why, because I'm Latina?

39:38.820 --> 39:41.687
No, because you're not like those girls,

39:41.689 --> 39:43.488
and you never will be.

39:44.825 --> 39:45.825
Don't you know that?

39:51.832 --> 39:53.632
So Connor snuck out, huh?

39:55.435 --> 39:57.402
Well, his dad seemed pretty mad.

39:57.404 --> 40:02.174
Um. Yeah, his... dad
doesn't really like me.

40:03.443 --> 40:04.576
Why not?

40:04.578 --> 40:06.212
What are we gonna tell Moms?

40:06.214 --> 40:09.849
Um, maybe a bird flew through the window?

40:09.851 --> 40:13.918
What, like a pterodactyl? No, they're
gonna know that we had a party.

40:13.920 --> 40:15.286
I could fix it.

40:16.655 --> 40:18.522
I worked last summer in construction.

40:18.524 --> 40:20.158
Plating a window's not
that hard. All we gotta do

40:20.160 --> 40:21.692
is get the glass
first-thing in the morning.

40:21.694 --> 40:24.162
Then I can just pop it in and glaze it.

40:24.164 --> 40:25.629
Glaze it?

40:27.066 --> 40:28.099
I'm not just a bouncer, you know.

40:30.102 --> 40:31.435
How can I help?

40:31.437 --> 40:32.770
You got a broom and dustpan?

40:38.677 --> 40:41.812
Hey, so... listen, I'm
sorry you had to be, like,

40:41.814 --> 40:44.481
the Gestapo tonight. I should never have...

40:44.483 --> 40:46.383
Sucks being the responsible one.

40:46.385 --> 40:48.118
Yeah. Tell me about it.

40:48.120 --> 40:50.220
It was worth it, though.

40:50.222 --> 40:52.622
Getting to hear you play again.

40:54.692 --> 40:56.927
That first song.

40:56.929 --> 40:58.428
Um...

40:58.430 --> 41:00.163
I know that's, like, ours.

41:00.165 --> 41:02.465
The only reason I played it was because...

41:02.467 --> 41:05.835
Because it's good. And you knew
they'd love it. And they did.

41:07.305 --> 41:08.671
You don't have to say that.

41:08.673 --> 41:11.308
I know. Brandon, you're really good.

41:11.310 --> 41:15.312
And, with you, that band
could really be something.

41:18.849 --> 41:21.217
Thanks.

41:21.219 --> 41:25.354
For being such a good... sister.

41:35.032 --> 41:36.565
- They're here, everyone.
- Come on, they're here.

41:40.570 --> 41:42.771
- Hey!
- Welcome back!

41:42.773 --> 41:46.074
Well, hey, what's going on?

41:46.076 --> 41:49.645
Nothing. We all just wanted to be
here when you got home, that's all.

41:49.647 --> 41:51.046
Yeah, we missed you!

41:51.048 --> 41:53.715
Aw, we missed you too, munchkin.

41:53.717 --> 41:55.751
Lemme take this.

41:55.753 --> 41:57.419
Well, isn't that nice.

41:59.590 --> 42:02.791
So how was it? What'd
you do? Was it romantic?

42:02.793 --> 42:05.193
Actually, it was.

42:05.195 --> 42:08.163
- We, uh, started...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. We don't wanna hear about it.

42:09.633 --> 42:12.901
We haven't even said anything.

42:12.903 --> 42:15.902
Ok, so, what about you
guys? How was your night?

42:15.904 --> 42:17.804
Uh, uneventful.

42:17.806 --> 42:19.172
It was super mell...
