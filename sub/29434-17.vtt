09:18.179 --> 09:19.790

09:19.833 --> 09:21.008

09:21.052 --> 09:22.923
exactly, he fits into this situation

09:22.967 --> 09:26.536

if any, in his own death.

09:26.539 --> 09:27.979
<i>I can tell you right now, this story</i>

09:27.980 --> 09:30.975
of Ali pulling a weapon
on a cop is suspect.

09:31.018 --> 09:34.283
Mitchell's service record
in the Navy is outstanding.

09:34.326 --> 09:36.546
Two letters of commendation
from his commanding officer,

09:36.589 --> 09:38.983
perfect evals, and
he's on the short list

09:39.026 --> 09:41.681

Petty Officer Second Class.

09:41.725 --> 09:44.767
This is... this, uh, was a stand-up guy.

09:44.810 --> 09:46.103
SEBASTIAN: <i>No, it doesn't sound</i>

09:46.146 --> 09:48.035
like someone that would
pull a gun on a cop.

09:48.079 --> 09:51.256
Bradley's police record
is less impressive.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.562
Seven years on the job

09:52.605 --> 09:54.825

for excessive force.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.228
GREGORIO: <i>We've all got complaints.</i>

09:56.229 --> 09:58.219
Doesn't necessarily mean
the guy's a bad actor.

09:58.263 --> 09:59.623
No, but given the circumstances,

09:59.625 --> 10:00.962
it's worth noting.

10:01.005 --> 10:02.267
<i>Was there a connection between</i>

10:02.311 --> 10:04.574
Gerald Young and Ali Mitchell?

10:07.272 --> 10:08.926
What?! No.

10:11.668 --> 10:13.104
<i>Gerald Young and Ali Mitchell</i>

10:13.147 --> 10:14.867
both grew up in the same
neighborhood, okay?

10:14.910 --> 10:15.998
It's a natural question.

10:16.042 --> 10:17.865
The bigger question is: where's the gun?

10:17.909 --> 10:19.470
<i>It's been 12 hours since the shooting.</i>

10:19.471 --> 10:20.633
<i>It still hasn't been found.</i>

10:20.677 --> 10:22.243
Maybe someone picked it up.

10:22.287 --> 10:24.115
Or maybe there is no gun.

10:24.158 --> 10:27.031
PRIDE: <i>Look, this is
a sensitive subject.</i>

10:27.074 --> 10:31.078

10:41.088 --> 10:42.612

10:42.655 --> 10:44.213
I'm godfather to his son.

10:44.256 --> 10:45.397
Even more reason.

10:45.441 --> 10:46.920
Gene, you're not impartial.

10:46.964 --> 10:49.227
And I couldn't release the
findings if I wanted to.

10:49.230 --> 10:50.670
You know what they're saying, right?

10:50.671 --> 10:52.622
White cop kills unarmed black man,

10:52.665 --> 10:54.275
business as usual for the NOPD.

10:54.319 --> 10:55.625
But that's not Bradley.

10:55.668 --> 10:58.062
They're saying the same
thing about Ali Mitchell,

10:58.105 --> 11:00.978
calling him a thug, that
he deserves to die.

11:01.021 --> 11:02.545
All those opinions are asinine.

11:02.588 --> 11:04.895
And none based in facts.

11:04.938 --> 11:06.723
They're calling him a racist, Loretta.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.028
This same racist

11:08.072 --> 11:10.204
is Big Brother to a kid in the 9th Ward.

11:10.208 --> 11:11.808
Doesn't mean he couldn't make a mistake.

11:11.809 --> 11:13.207
Not this kid.

11:13.251 --> 11:14.992
And that'll be proven
once we find a gun.

11:15.035 --> 11:16.776
If you find a gun.

11:16.820 --> 11:19.866
Now, we are working
hard to get to the truth.

11:19.910 --> 11:21.955
Hope the NOPD is doing the same.

11:21.999 --> 11:23.435
I support Bradley,

11:23.479 --> 11:26.438
and I will overturn every
rock there is to help him.

11:26.482 --> 11:30.355
But I will not be placing
rocks where there are none.

You seem to be everywhere, Holloway.

11:32.188 --> 11:33.445

Actually, I was, uh,

11:34.968 --> 11:36.753

11:39.059 --> 11:40.496
I'm okay with that.

11:41.714 --> 11:43.281
In the interest of transparency.

11:50.070 --> 11:53.204
Petty Officer Ali

11:53.247 --> 11:54.814

11:54.858 --> 11:56.686

11:56.729 --> 11:58.775
<i>The second bullet hit the liver</i>

11:58.818 --> 12:00.994
and was lodged inside the spinal cord.

12:02.996 --> 12:07.131
Only thing that really confirms
is that Bradley is responsible

12:07.174 --> 12:09.525

17:48.167 --> 17:50.735
State police just found a gun.

17:53.036 --> 17:55.036
<i>♪ ♪</i>

17:56.337 --> 17:59.037
<i>♪ ♪</i>

17:59.973 --> 18:01.844
Been on the phone with
the governor's office.

18:01.888 --> 18:04.159
They want a press conference to update

18:04.203 --> 18:07.633
the shooting investigation
and quell the growing unrest.

18:07.676 --> 18:10.357
Bit premature with no
actual updates yet.

18:10.401 --> 18:12.354
We found the weapon
Detective Bradley says

18:12.398 --> 18:13.839
<i>Petty Officer Mitchell brandished.</i>

18:13.842 --> 18:15.462
Weapon hasn't even been analyzed.

18:15.463 --> 18:17.925
Bradley saw a gun, we found a gun.

18:17.969 --> 18:19.231
In my experience,

18:19.274 --> 18:20.915
the straightest line leads to the truth.

18:20.959 --> 18:24.262
A gun was found three
blocks from the crime scene,

18:24.305 --> 18:26.525
hidden behind a loose brick
in an abandoned building.

18:26.568 --> 18:28.044
Not exactly a straight line.

18:28.088 --> 18:29.745
COOPER: <i>It's progress.</i>

18:29.789 --> 18:31.573
<i>And the governor isn't asking.</i>

18:31.617 --> 18:34.620
He wants a joint press
conference. United front.

18:34.663 --> 18:37.492
I'd just as soon wait for
the analysis of the gun.

18:37.536 --> 18:39.059
And frankly,

18:39.103 --> 18:41.496
I'd like my team to perform it.

18:41.540 --> 18:45.500
The state's lab is perfectly
capable of analyzing a firearm.

18:45.544 --> 18:48.547
You'll get the report
once it's complete.

18:48.590 --> 18:50.830
And I'll be happy to participate
in your press conference

18:50.831 --> 18:52.116
once I do.

18:52.159 --> 18:53.334
HOLLOWAY: <i>Dwayne,</i>

18:53.378 --> 18:54.727
<i>be reasonable.</i>

18:54.770 --> 18:56.555
This could lead to riots in the streets.

18:56.598 --> 18:58.731
It'll be worse if we get it wrong, Gene.

18:58.774 --> 19:00.994
HANNAH: I wonder
what they're discussing.

19:01.038 --> 19:02.958
Probably how far to throw
Mitchell under the bus.

19:02.959 --> 19:04.855
Not Pride. Still too many
unanswered questions.

19:04.898 --> 19:06.883
Yeah, like where that
gun's been this whole time.

19:06.927 --> 19:08.276
And how it magically appeared.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.360
We have all the pieces,
they just don't seem to fit.

19:10.403 --> 19:11.881
There's one person who might be able

19:11.883 --> 19:13.823
to shed some light on this Gerald Young.

19:13.824 --> 19:14.874
<i>Bradley was chasing him</i>

19:14.917 --> 19:16.791
<i>- before the shooting.</i>
- GREGORIO: <i>No, He's a fugitive now.</i>

19:16.792 --> 19:18.443
Every cop in the state is after him.

19:18.486 --> 19:21.057
What if we take another crack
at his girlfriend Jasmine?

19:21.058 --> 19:22.450
Not treat her like a suspect.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.017
She could give us the inside scoop.

19:24.061 --> 19:25.714
Worth a try.

19:25.758 --> 19:27.438
HOLLOWAY: <i>I'm not
asking for myself, Pride.</i>

19:27.439 --> 19:28.543
I'm asking for Bradley.

19:28.587 --> 19:30.067
A press conference could help him.

19:30.110 --> 19:31.590
<i>He's been receiving death threats.</i>

19:31.633 --> 19:33.553
Last night they threw a
brick through his window.

19:33.554 --> 19:35.028
He deserves a fair shake, too.

19:35.072 --> 19:36.334
Oh, I'm not so sure he does.

19:37.422 --> 19:39.032
And who are you?

19:39.036 --> 19:40.436
Special Agent Carter, investigating

19:40.437 --> 19:42.470
- Ali Mitchell's shooting.
- Well,

19:42.514 --> 19:45.169
maybe Pride neglected to
tell you, they found the gun.

19:45.212 --> 19:46.387
The investigation's over.

19:46.431 --> 19:48.607
That's not how investigations work.

19:48.650 --> 19:50.609
Son, I know how investigations work.

19:50.652 --> 19:52.741
I don't need a lecture
from the freshman class.

19:52.785 --> 19:55.222
Does the food taste better
in the house than in the field?

19:55.266 --> 19:57.920
Boy, who the hell do you think you are?

19:57.964 --> 20:00.793
- That's enough, Carter.
- No, no, no. He started this.

20:00.836 --> 20:02.664
Let him finish.

20:02.708 --> 20:04.753
Well?

20:05.798 --> 20:06.842
Hmm.

20:06.886 --> 20:08.061
Know what?

20:08.105 --> 20:10.020
I got a lead I need to follow anyway.

20:10.063 --> 20:12.587
Hmm.

20:12.631 --> 20:15.242
Who the hell is this kid?

20:15.286 --> 20:17.549
I need this.

20:17.592 --> 20:19.029
[QUIETLY] Hannah.

20:19.072 --> 20:20.987
- Go with him, please.
<i>- Okay.</i>

20:22.162 --> 20:24.034
HANNAH: <i>What was that about</i>

20:24.077 --> 20:25.426
back there, with Holloway?

20:25.470 --> 20:26.601
Don't worry about it.

20:26.645 --> 20:28.081
<i>Oh, well, I am worried.</i>

20:28.125 --> 20:29.685
'Cause we're about to talk to a witness

20:29.688 --> 20:31.528
that might be the only
person that can help us,

20:31.529 --> 20:33.534
and you're distracted.

20:35.523 --> 20:36.742
[EXHALES] Believe it or not,

20:36.785 --> 20:38.613
I want to help.

20:38.657 --> 20:40.833
- You can't.
- You're not the only person

20:40.876 --> 20:43.792
that's ever experienced
discrimination, you know?

20:43.836 --> 20:44.956
- I never said I was.
- Yeah,

20:44.960 --> 20:46.520
but you made a few assumptions about me

20:46.521 --> 20:47.968
back there that weren't fair.

20:48.667 --> 20:49.929
Maybe.

20:51.757 --> 20:54.803
Let's work together on this, okay?

20:54.847 --> 20:59.678
Because, look, I may not
have walked in your shoes,

20:59.721 --> 21:01.767
but I'm gonna have your back.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.858
What can I do?

21:07.860 --> 21:09.818
You can give me a hand.

21:09.862 --> 21:11.690
Just brought you some
things for the baby.

21:11.733 --> 21:14.388
Uh, diapers, snacks, milk.

21:14.432 --> 21:18.131
I'll take the groceries, but I'm
not giving Gerald up to you.

21:18.175 --> 21:19.393
CARTER: <i>That's okay.</i>

21:19.437 --> 21:21.569
I just want to give
this back to you, too.

21:24.094 --> 21:25.834
Figured those other cops took it.

21:25.878 --> 21:27.401
Ali and Gerald were real close, huh?

21:27.445 --> 21:29.142
Almost like brothers.

21:29.186 --> 21:31.057
But everybody loved Ali.

21:31.101 --> 21:32.189
He was a good man.

21:32.192 --> 21:33.632
<i>We know Gerald got into some trouble</i>

21:33.633 --> 21:35.322
back then. Was Ali part of that?

21:35.366 --> 21:37.150
As teenagers, yeah.

21:37.194 --> 21:38.847
But it was just kid stuff,

21:38.891 --> 21:40.741
and Ali grew out of
it after junior year.

21:40.785 --> 21:42.155
He found a new interest.

21:42.199 --> 21:44.288
- What was that?
- The Navy.

21:44.331 --> 21:46.333
Recruiter came by the
school. Took to Ali.

21:46.377 --> 21:48.118
Said he had potential.

21:48.161 --> 21:50.642
Helped clean up his
record, changed his life.

21:50.685 --> 21:53.123
This is really important, Jasmine.

21:53.166 --> 21:55.864
Was Ali helping Gerald with
those warehouse robberies?

21:55.908 --> 21:57.257
Ali? Hell no.

21:57.301 --> 21:59.781
He was the one nagging
Gerald to quit the game.

21:59.825 --> 22:02.175
And Gerald never would've
even asked him to join in.

22:02.219 --> 22:04.743
He respected the path that Ali took.

22:04.786 --> 22:06.146
HANNAH: <i>Do you think it's possible</i>

22:06.190 --> 22:07.790
that he had a gun on
him the other night?

22:07.791 --> 22:09.182
No, ma'am.

22:09.226 --> 22:10.749
Not possible.

22:10.792 --> 22:12.794
And Gerald would tell you the same.

22:12.838 --> 22:14.840
I'd like to hear what he has to say.

22:14.883 --> 22:17.234
Come on, you've seen the news.

22:17.277 --> 22:18.626
<i>How they're portraying Ali.</i>

22:18.670 --> 22:20.150
Like some kind of thug.

22:20.193 --> 22:21.953
HANNAH: <i>Look, we're
trying to clear his name.</i>

22:21.954 --> 22:24.893
Okay, Gerald's statement
could really help.

22:24.937 --> 22:26.465
Jasmine, you're the mother of a son.

22:26.508 --> 22:27.766
A black son.

22:27.809 --> 22:29.246
Imagine something like that

22:29.289 --> 22:30.769
happens to him one day.

22:30.812 --> 22:33.424
Then his legacy was
tarnished by these lies.

22:33.467 --> 22:37.210
Now think about Ali's mother, Jasmine.

22:38.733 --> 22:41.171
Tell us where Gerald is.

22:44.086 --> 22:45.653
Jasmine doesn't know where Gerald is,

22:45.697 --> 22:48.265
but she gave Carter and
I this list of possibilities.

22:48.268 --> 22:49.828
Okay, so this is the closest we've come

22:49.829 --> 22:51.093
- to finding him so far.
- Yeah.

22:51.137 --> 22:53.137
- Let's get warrants and search them.
- Yeah, yeah.

22:53.138 --> 22:54.619
Hey, hold up, hold up.

22:54.662 --> 22:56.403
Y'all need to see this.

22:58.379 --> 23:00.781
- _
- My son Ali...

23:02.017 --> 23:03.671
...was a good man.

23:03.715 --> 23:07.458
<i>He didn't deserve to leave
this life the way that he did.</i>

23:07.501 --> 23:10.156
And now they're calling him a thug.

23:10.200 --> 23:13.725
A-a gangbanger, a drug dealer.

23:13.768 --> 23:16.989
<i>They're saying he got
what was coming to him.</i>

23:17.032 --> 23:18.730
Why are they doing this?

23:18.773 --> 23:20.688
God, this woman must
be in a living hell.

23:20.732 --> 23:24.344
The Mitchell family have
been upstanding members

23:24.388 --> 23:27.217
- of this community.
- How many unarmed black men have to die

23:27.260 --> 23:30.394
- before enough is enough?
- MAN: <i>Danziger!</i>

23:30.437 --> 23:32.700
CROWD [CHANTING]: <i>Danziger! Danziger!</i>

23:32.744 --> 23:35.137
Danziger! Danziger!

23:35.181 --> 23:38.358
<i>- Danziger!</i>
- Why are they chanting "Danziger"?

23:38.402 --> 23:40.055
Danziger Bridge.

23:40.099 --> 23:41.709
<i>After Hurricane Katrina hit,</i>

23:41.753 --> 23:44.722
police shot six unarmed black
people waiting to get rescued.

23:44.765 --> 23:46.323
Two died.

23:46.366 --> 23:48.368
I never heard about that.

23:48.412 --> 23:50.718
It's not New Orleans' finest hour.

23:50.762 --> 23:52.442
<i>They're not gonna put
that on the brochure.</i>

23:52.459 --> 23:53.721
<i>But it happens all the time.</i>

23:53.765 --> 23:55.593
Hell, I was almost a statistic.

23:55.636 --> 23:57.290
Police pulled me over.

23:57.334 --> 23:59.174
Said I fit the description
of a murder suspect.

23:59.175 --> 24:01.425
Had me sprawled on the
ground with a gun in my face.

24:01.468 --> 24:03.035
That was before my accident, though.

24:03.078 --> 24:04.602
Did things change after that?

24:04.645 --> 24:07.222
Well, people feel sorry for
me because of the chair.

24:07.266 --> 24:08.827
That accident's probably the best thing

24:08.828 --> 24:09.885
that ever happened to me.

24:09.929 --> 24:11.304
Oh, come on, Patton, really?

24:11.348 --> 24:13.828
Look, don't get me
wrong. I miss walking.

24:13.872 --> 24:15.830
But the police don't treat
me the same no more.

24:15.874 --> 24:18.485
It's as if the chair erased my race.

24:18.529 --> 24:20.313
I'm no longer seen as a threat.

24:20.357 --> 24:22.357
- As if you could ever be threatening.
- [CHUCKLES]

24:22.359 --> 24:23.403
Thank you, baby.

24:23.447 --> 24:25.318
But it is a problem for black men.

24:25.362 --> 24:27.886
Carter probably has his own stories.

24:27.929 --> 24:30.169
And I'm positive that Wade
had the talk with her two boys

24:30.170 --> 24:33.544
about how to act, not <i>if,</i> but <i>when</i>

24:33.587 --> 24:35.981
they get stopped by the police.

24:37.722 --> 24:40.333
It's just a fact of life.

24:40.377 --> 24:42.509
At least for now.

24:49.908 --> 24:51.431
Got your message. What's so urgent?

24:51.475 --> 24:52.476
WADE: <i>Well,</i>

24:52.519 --> 24:53.719
I'm not supposed to have this.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.348
It's not official yet.

24:55.392 --> 24:57.524
But a friend of mine at the state lab

24:57.568 --> 24:58.960
slipped it to me.

24:59.004 --> 25:01.109
Analysis of the weapon
state police found?

25:01.111 --> 25:02.178
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:02.221 --> 25:05.576
<i>30 distinct different
fingerprints were lifted.</i>

25:05.619 --> 25:08.056
None belonging to Ali Mitchell.

25:08.100 --> 25:10.798
My friend at the lab thinks

25:10.842 --> 25:13.323
it's a community gun, whatever that is.

25:13.366 --> 25:16.021
People on probation or parole
will hide guns in public areas,

25:16.064 --> 25:19.677
rather than hold on their person
and risk going back to jail.

25:19.720 --> 25:22.070
Well, whatever kind of gun it was...

25:22.114 --> 25:24.508
it didn't belong to Ali Mitchell.

25:28.425 --> 25:30.078
Watching all these videos,

25:30.122 --> 25:32.642
- I think I'm starting to hallucinate.
- PATTON: <i>Hey, Sebastian.</i>

25:32.643 --> 25:35.168
Check this out, man. Think
it's happening to me, too.

25:35.211 --> 25:37.042
Look at this.

25:37.085 --> 25:39.305
Well, that's definitely on the video.

25:39.349 --> 25:40.567
<i>Think it might be a gun?</i>

25:40.611 --> 25:42.743
I don't know. Looks more
like a shadow to me.

25:42.787 --> 25:45.746
- How we doing in here?
- Oh, we found something, but

25:45.790 --> 25:47.400
can't quite figure out what it is.

25:47.444 --> 25:49.141
Might not be good news for Ali Mitchell.

25:49.184 --> 25:51.056
It could be a gun, could be a shadow.

25:51.099 --> 25:52.739
But if it was anything,
it would have been

25:52.782 --> 25:54.523
bagged and tagged
right after the shooting.

25:54.567 --> 25:56.017
Unless...

25:56.061 --> 25:57.981
- [PHONE RINGING]
- I mean, unless it disappeared

25:57.982 --> 25:59.151
in there.

25:59.194 --> 26:00.834
I could go back to the
scene, take a look.

26:00.835 --> 26:03.851
Uh, yeah, get on it, Sebastian.

26:05.395 --> 26:07.420
Special Agent Pride speaking.

26:07.464 --> 26:10.684
Uh, I-I-I understand, but...

26:10.728 --> 26:13.252
well, I think it's a terrible idea.

26:13.295 --> 26:14.906
We still haven't...

26:14.949 --> 26:17.735
Yes, ma'am.

26:17.778 --> 26:19.301
Understood.

26:20.520 --> 26:21.956
I've just been ordered

26:22.000 --> 26:24.306
to participate in the press conference.

26:24.350 --> 26:25.525
Seems official Washington

26:25.569 --> 26:27.962
wants a united front, too.

26:29.399 --> 26:31.444
COOPER: <i>I'm Detective Christina Cooper</i>
