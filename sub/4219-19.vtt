WEBVTT

00:00.709 --> 00:04.003
I took a couple of pills.
I had a flare up with my back.

00:04.129 --> 00:06.214
- You need to get into rehab.
- I will go to rehab.

00:06.340 --> 00:10.176
- We're going to find a great place.
- Maybe we should stop looking.

00:10.302 --> 00:14.722
- You and Casey?
- I got a lot of baggage, Donna.

00:14.848 --> 00:18.059
- The past is the past, Wallace.
- And I can't put you through that.

00:18.394 --> 00:21.479
CFD is not right for everyone.

00:21.605 --> 00:23.981
It's the one thing that
I've wanted, my whole life.

00:24.108 --> 00:25.650
And he's taking it away from me.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.568
Tell Dawson I stopped by?

00:29.196 --> 00:32.323
Jones. They...
They just found her body.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.328
We work a dangerous job.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.956
We all knew that when we signed up.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.628
A fire-fighter dies in the line of duty,
we are shocked, our hearts are broken,

00:45.754 --> 00:47.672
but in some dark corner of our mind

00:47.798 --> 00:50.133
we are bracing ourself
for that possibility.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.434
When a fire-fighter takes her own
life...

01:02.438 --> 01:05.064
that is not a contingency
that we can prepare for.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.570
We can't change what happened.
But we can learn from it.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.407
We all missed the signs here.

01:16.827 --> 01:22.081
And we can never let it happen again.
So, you reach out to each other.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.083
You be there for each other.

01:25.294 --> 01:30.006
Not just for today, or this week,
always.

01:31.091 --> 01:35.261
I never want to see another member of
this family slip through the cracks.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.432
Let's go to work.

01:47.983 --> 01:50.526
Let's go for a ride.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.155
This place isn't so bad.
How's it working out for him?

01:54.281 --> 01:56.032
I don't know. I haven't
checked up on him yet.

01:56.158 --> 01:56.991
I've been too busy.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.619
But Boden's speech got me thinking,

01:59.745 --> 02:02.079
Bloom could use some
more encouragement right about now.

02:06.668 --> 02:07.835
Hey, Severide.

02:08.295 --> 02:11.297
- Seriously?
- It'll cheer him up.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.674
- Come on, Mills.
- No. I'll pass.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.428
All right. Room service!

02:22.726 --> 02:24.393
He was supposed to be in 109.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.521
Well, I'm sorry to
have to tell you this,

02:26.647 --> 02:28.356
but Mr Bloom checked himself out.

02:28.482 --> 02:34.779
- How long did he last?
- About 12 hours into a 28-day program.

02:35.239 --> 02:36.989
I've seen worse.

02:46.542 --> 02:48.376
- Thanks for coming, Shay.
- Yeah.

02:48.502 --> 02:51.045
Listen, before you say
anything, I know.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.005
I am moving a little fast.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.550
- It's not that. It...
- Things haven't been perfect.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.593
She's trying to make
a big career shift,

02:57.719 --> 02:59.804
and she thinks I'm on
the fence about it.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.265
That's why I want to let her know
this is real.

03:02.391 --> 03:05.309
And in light of recent events, why wait?

03:06.478 --> 03:08.521
Tomorrow isn't guaranteed for anybody.

03:08.647 --> 03:10.439
OK.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.110
- You want to see?
- Yeah.

03:18.282 --> 03:21.701
Oh, this one.
That's Dawson, right there.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.661
That was my pick.
Back me up. That was my pick.

03:23.787 --> 03:26.414
- That was his pick.
- It's really pretty.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.459
- I'm gonna do it.
- I'll get one in her size.

03:30.586 --> 03:33.170
- What is it?
- Er...

03:34.423 --> 03:35.423
I'm on the case.

03:38.302 --> 03:43.222
Hey, roomie. Cable bill's due.
Make with the cheddar.

03:43.348 --> 03:47.351
- $140?!
- Yeah, that includes the set-up fee.

03:47.477 --> 03:51.689
- Yeah, and your NFL package.
- Your half is $70.

03:53.150 --> 03:56.694
Haven't seen Clarke this morning.
He still subbing over at 25?

03:56.820 --> 04:01.866
- He's not subbing out. He transferred.
- Just like that? No explanation?

04:01.992 --> 04:04.702
No goodbye? What a jerk.

04:04.828 --> 04:09.123
- That's her.
- Gabriela Dawson?

04:09.249 --> 04:11.542
- Oh, God, what did you do this time?
- Yeah?

04:11.668 --> 04:15.087
This note was left behind for you
in Rebecca Jones' apartment.

04:21.011 --> 04:24.263
- Why?
- I wouldn't know.

04:37.861 --> 04:40.196
Why would
she leave me a note?

04:42.157 --> 04:44.241
Only one way to find out.

05:02.886 --> 05:06.931
Engine 51, Truck 81,
Squad 3, Ambulance 61.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.599
Fire. Grand and Ashland.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.692
You OK?

05:19.152 --> 05:23.698
No. No, I'm not.
I want some answers.

05:23.824 --> 05:27.785
I mean, how does someone like Jones,
who's so driven, so determined,

05:27.911 --> 05:33.290
how does she just... give up on herself?

05:34.751 --> 05:36.377
I don't know.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.049
What's it say?

05:43.260 --> 05:44.468
Nothing.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.223
Oh, wow.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.988
Otis, make sure the pumps are
shut down!

06:04.114 --> 06:07.992
Everyone get in with extinguishers!
Don't wait for 51!

06:12.039 --> 06:13.831
You've got to get my wife!
She's in the car!

06:13.957 --> 06:15.332
We'll take care of her.
Get out!

06:15.459 --> 06:19.920
- Shay!
- Got him, Herrmann!

06:20.047 --> 06:24.175
- OK, let's get you out of there!
- I... I can't! I can't!

06:24.301 --> 06:26.677
All right, all right, just stay put!
Stay put!

06:26.803 --> 06:30.097
Listen, she can't get out of here!
She's in a full leg brace!

06:30.223 --> 06:31.515
Let's get this fire out!

06:31.641 --> 06:34.101
Come on. Come with me.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.943
- I got you, Janice! I got you!
- Sir, wait!

06:43.070 --> 06:44.278
Casey!

06:44.404 --> 06:45.613
Hey!

06:48.658 --> 06:51.452
What are you doing!

06:52.662 --> 06:54.205
Stop!

06:55.749 --> 06:57.875
Get all under the pick-up!

06:58.752 --> 07:00.294
I got you!

07:01.755 --> 07:02.880
- You're OK.
- I got you.

07:03.006 --> 07:05.800
- Get out of there, numbnuts!
- Herrmann!

07:08.220 --> 07:11.972
Sir, please step out of the vehicle,
if you'd be so kind.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.897
That was the dumbest move
I've seen in a long time.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.566
Yeah, Darwin Award
thinking right there.

07:22.692 --> 07:23.734
What a call.

07:23.860 --> 07:28.072
Hey, what do you guys suppose Jones said
in that note to Dawson?

07:31.785 --> 07:33.744
I'm just curious.

07:35.789 --> 07:40.292
The other night
Jones stopped by Molly's,

07:40.418 --> 07:42.002
she was looking for Dawson.

07:42.129 --> 07:47.967
- Really? What for?
- No idea.

07:48.969 --> 07:54.265
But she apparently went straight home
and... you know the rest.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.648
OK, you guys, pony up.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.234
I talked to Bloom's
old Battalion Chief in Denver

08:05.360 --> 08:07.361
and I got an idea how to help him out.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.947
First step, we fill up this boot.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.871
$5. Really?

08:16.997 --> 08:20.124
OK, do you guys know the warehouse fire
that derailed Bloom's career?

08:20.250 --> 08:22.877
Yeah, ten guys got killed.

08:23.003 --> 08:27.798
- Cos of a tough call he had to make.
- He was the incident commander.

08:27.924 --> 08:31.093
That's right.
Fire was in the structure.

08:31.219 --> 08:34.889
He had to give an order,
no one else goes in.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.600
He made those guys stand there

08:37.726 --> 08:41.061
and listen to their brothers
dying over the radio.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.982
They spit in his face,
tried to go around him.

08:45.108 --> 08:50.946
He wrestled a few of them to the ground.
That's how he hurt his back.

08:51.072 --> 08:56.869
He was trying to protect them
but the way they saw it,

08:56.995 --> 09:00.873
he abandoned all those guys inside.
Got them all killed.

09:04.252 --> 09:09.673
That is a heavy weight for a man to
carry around, don't you think?

09:11.718 --> 09:14.261
We can stop by the ATM.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.392
Hey, I know why you're doing this,

09:20.518 --> 09:22.269
but this guy's gonna keep
letting you down.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.271
- You know that, right?
- Uh-huh.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.857
But you're gonna try anyway.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.694
When Jones first arrived at 51,

09:30.820 --> 09:33.697
I made it clear that I wasn't someone
that she could come to for help.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.616
I thought she needed
a little tough love.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.035
- You can't put that on yourself, Kelly.
- I'm not.

09:38.161 --> 09:41.330
I... I didn't know
where her head was at.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.249
But if Bloom goes into a tailspin,

09:43.375 --> 09:46.126
I can't claim that
I didn't see it coming.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.223
Look, you guys, you got to agree

09:59.349 --> 10:01.642
that that's a pretty heavy weight
for a man to carry around.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.520
Look, personally,
I would love to give to the cause,

10:04.646 --> 10:06.063
but I have to subsidise Cruz's need

10:06.189 --> 10:08.899
to see every single televised
sporting event known to man.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.986
Come on, man. We agreed we were
gonna split everything 50-50.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.779
Can we just focus for like,
two seconds...

10:13.905 --> 10:16.156
You could watch every single game
at Molly's for free.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.492
Oh, yeah, and then all my beer money
goes into your pocket.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.785
You'd like that, I bet.

10:19.911 --> 10:21.829
As if you ever pay a tab anyway.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.040
- What did you say?
- Otis.

10:25.166 --> 10:28.502
- I need you to clear out Jones' locker.
- Why me?

10:28.628 --> 10:31.964
Well, you're the one with the box.

10:32.090 --> 10:35.092
- Great.
- What is the big deal?

10:41.308 --> 10:43.017
- Hey, Shay?
- Mmm?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.519
- I got a favour to ask.
- No.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.354
It has to do with Jones.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.857
We need to clear out her locker,

10:49.983 --> 10:54.528
but in the interest
of gender sensitivity, would you mind?

10:54.654 --> 10:58.574
God forbid you guys
have to touch a box of tampons.

10:58.700 --> 11:02.369
- I owe you so much.
- You're going to hell, you know that?

11:02.495 --> 11:03.871
It's worth it.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.166
You guys just don't think
that you owe Jones at least that much?

11:10.295 --> 11:12.421
What do you mean, we owe Jones?

11:15.300 --> 11:17.593
Nothing.

11:17.719 --> 11:22.848
I'm gonna leave this here for a while.
You guys do what you think is right, OK?

11:22.974 --> 11:24.808
Thanks.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.689
I just...

11:31.983 --> 11:35.277
I wish she left behind some clue
as to why she did it.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.780
Oh, you mean, like a note?

11:37.906 --> 11:40.491
That note did not answer any questions,
trust me.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.120
Huh!
She was in the class of 300.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.289
A lot older than she looked.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.755
I wonder what this ring
would look like on a person.

11:54.881 --> 11:59.468
- Whoa, what are you doing? Stop!
- OK, I'm just goofing around, gosh.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.888
Honestly, what do you expect to find?

12:07.435 --> 12:09.311
I just want to know how
a girl as tough as Jones

12:09.437 --> 12:13.273
could let her father push her
to the breaking point.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.404
So it's all her dad's fault?

12:19.823 --> 12:22.408
Don't go down that rabbit hole, Dawson.

12:22.534 --> 12:26.412
Trying to find a rational explanation
for an irrational act.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.001
I made that mistake once, remember?

12:39.134 --> 12:40.968
You know how it is, Chief.

12:41.094 --> 12:45.431
Bunch of hard-ass fire-fighters
avoiding real emotion at all costs.

12:45.557 --> 12:50.436
- How are you holding up?
- Not too bad.

12:50.562 --> 12:55.732
- It helps to have someone to lean on.
- Yeah.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.318
Have you reconnected with Donna?

13:00.029 --> 13:02.739
We are supposed to be talking about you.

13:04.576 --> 13:09.413
- Chaplain.
- Er, sorry. I can wait.

13:09.539 --> 13:13.417
No, no, no. It's fine.
We're all done here.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.462
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, sir.

13:18.298 --> 13:25.179
Er... Wallace.
I'm real sorry about your candidate.

13:28.016 --> 13:31.185
The Commissioner sent me over
to check up on your house.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.438
I got it covered, Bill.
Or, at least I'm trying.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.940
Look, Chief, I can go if you want me to.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.109
But your people have suffered a loss,

13:39.235 --> 13:42.529
and they may need help
getting through this rough patch.

13:45.283 --> 13:49.411
Peter Mills is one of my people now.

13:49.537 --> 13:52.539
- Did you know that?
- I did.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.210
So don't botch it,
the way you did with his father.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.465
OK.

14:09.265 --> 14:13.143
Hey! Chaplain Orlovsky's in the house!
How you doin', padre?

14:13.269 --> 14:15.395
Ah, real good, Christopher,
thanks for asking.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.147
- Yeah.
- How's everybody?

14:17.273 --> 14:18.815
- Good!
- Hey, Chaplain.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.235
I need one of you guys
to take this stuff

14:21.361 --> 14:23.362
over to Chief Jones' office
after shift.

14:23.488 --> 14:26.490
Can't be me. I got to get my
mother-in-law over to the podiatrist.

14:26.616 --> 14:29.326
Guys, guys.

14:29.452 --> 14:32.663
I don't care who does it,
just make sure it gets done.

14:36.459 --> 14:40.837
- Hey, Chaplain Orlovsky.
- Peter, good to see you, buddy.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.173
You, too.

14:43.299 --> 14:46.176
- My recipe book.
- Huh?

14:46.302 --> 14:49.471
Er, she needed a little help in
that department.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.265
Oh!

14:51.391 --> 14:52.683
- Oh...
- Oh.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.936
- Oh. Nice catch, padre.
- She was a bowler.

14:56.062 --> 14:59.356
- Who, Jones?
- This is a 300 ring.

14:59.482 --> 15:03.277
- She bowled a perfect game.
- Whoa, she was a serious bowler.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.572
That is not how I would have guessed
she spent her time.

15:06.698 --> 15:09.449
Hey, here's an idea.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.994
How about after shift, we all go out
and bowl a couple of games.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.371
You know, in honour of Jones.

15:15.873 --> 15:18.208
Yeah, maybe.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.755
Man, you guys are cold.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.716
Why? Cos we're not in a bowling mood?

15:25.842 --> 15:27.968
No, you should have been nicer to her.

15:28.094 --> 15:31.305
- Whoa.
- Excuse me?

15:31.431 --> 15:35.934
I'm just saying that I know what it's
like to be a candidate in this house.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.186
And that girl, she tried like hell,

15:38.313 --> 15:41.565
you guys wouldn't let her sit
with the cool kids.

15:41.691 --> 15:46.445
Hey, Mills, are you trying
to pin this on us?

15:46.571 --> 15:49.323
No.
No, that's not what I'm saying.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.824
Then what are you saying?

15:50.950 --> 15:54.745
Mills! Severide wants to
take another field trip.

16:01.252 --> 16:05.547
Yeah, yeah, go on back
to your squad buddies!

16:28.738 --> 16:32.658
Hey, Bloom, you in there?
It's me, Kelly. I'm coming in.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.348
Bloom!

16:58.142 --> 17:00.519
What the hell? You just sit there
and watch him give me the slip?

17:00.645 --> 17:02.187
What? I honked!

17:26.963 --> 17:31.049
- Right here.
- Hey, Chief, what's up?

17:31.175 --> 17:33.260
Come on in, close the door.

17:35.847 --> 17:38.390
You OK to take
the fire-fighter's test next week?

17:38.516 --> 17:42.811
Yeah, yeah, my paperwork's in order.

17:44.522 --> 17:48.734
No, I mean, are you...
Are you OK?

17:48.860 --> 17:53.238
What with the Jones' thing and all?

17:53.364 --> 17:56.575
I'm pissed off, Chief.

17:56.701 --> 18:00.954
- At who?
- I don't know. Everything.

18:01.080 --> 18:05.292
- I'll be fine.
- No, no, no. Don't you bottle that up.

18:05.418 --> 18:09.212
I'm right here.
You can talk to me any time.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.008
OK. Thanks.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.095
Have you given any more thought
to where it is

18:17.221 --> 18:19.723
that you might want to land
when you pass your test?

18:19.849 --> 18:23.268
I am more than willing
to make some calls on your behalf.

18:24.979 --> 18:29.191
Well, I don't mean to sound like a...
a vulture circling overhead,

18:29.317 --> 18:32.319
but doesn't 81 need a new candidate?

18:33.571 --> 18:36.406
Jones' spot is not an option for you.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.576
You must know that
you have to find another company.

18:39.702 --> 18:42.370
You can't serve under Casey.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.416
You mean, because we're involved?

18:48.211 --> 18:50.170
Give it some more thought.

19:22.787 --> 19:25.539
Hey. How are you holding up?

19:25.665 --> 19:28.875
Why's everyone so worried about me?

19:31.170 --> 19:34.214
I'm sorry. I mean, I'm good. Thanks.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.634
Listen, erm, I got us into RPM.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.553
They're booked like two months out

19:39.679 --> 19:42.138
but I charmed our way in
two weeks from Saturday.

19:42.265 --> 19:45.767
- So keep it free.
- Cool.

19:45.893 --> 19:51.398
- We can raise a glass to Jones.
- Absolutely.

19:53.609 --> 19:57.571
Ambulance 51. Sick person.
705 South Oakley.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.539
In here! She's in here!

20:07.665 --> 20:11.543
I don't know what happened to her!
My beautiful girl, look at her!

20:12.628 --> 20:15.839
- What's the matter, honey?
- Show them, Ella. Let them see!

20:20.720 --> 20:23.597
She insisted on going to
this sleep-over last night.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.724
I knew it was a bad idea,
and now she's sick!

20:25.850 --> 20:28.935
- Dad.
- Sir, give us some space, please.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.062
- She's running a fever.
- Meningitis?

20:31.188 --> 20:33.523
Meningitis?! Oh...
Oh, that's perfect.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.442
With these lesions?
I don't know.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.069
Sweetheart, does your head hurt,
or your neck?

20:38.195 --> 20:40.614
Ella, you see,
this is why I didn't want you to go.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.449
- Sir...
- But you don't want to listen to me!

20:42.575 --> 20:43.617
No, of course not!

20:43.743 --> 20:45.785
- Let us examine your daughter...
- She never listens.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.162
- Not to me, her mother!
- Hey!

20:47.288 --> 20:49.706
Your little girl needs
exactly one thing from you right now,

20:49.832 --> 20:52.042
and that's your unwavering support.
You understand?

20:52.168 --> 20:53.877
Dawson...

20:56.589 --> 20:58.924
Did any other girls
from the sleep-over have these symptoms?

20:59.050 --> 21:02.135
- I don't think so.
- When did this come on?

21:02.261 --> 21:03.345
Just this morning.

21:03.471 --> 21:05.931
I mean, she had strep throat last week,
but she got over that.

21:06.057 --> 21:07.057
Strep throat?

21:07.183 --> 21:08.975
Yeah, that's why
I didn't want her to go.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.519
- I figured her immune system was...
- Was she on antibiotics?

21:11.646 --> 21:13.939
Er, yeah. Amoxicillin.

21:16.150 --> 21:18.818
- Heard of Stevens-Johnson syndrome?
- No.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.737
Get the fluids ready.
We need to load and go.

21:20.863 --> 21:23.323
Your daughter's having
a reaction to the amoxicillin.

21:23.449 --> 21:27.077
- She needs to get to the ER right now.
- Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.620
- Daddy...
- It's OK.

21:28.746 --> 21:31.873
Oh, my, God. I'm so sorry.

21:31.999 --> 21:35.543
So, er, what else can
you guys tell me about Rebecca?

21:35.670 --> 21:39.297
I never had the pleasure of meeting her.

21:39.423 --> 21:43.718
She was tall. Kind of funny sometimes.

21:43.844 --> 21:48.014
- Funny, like a good sense of humour?
- Mm-hmm.

21:51.769 --> 21:56.272
So, Peter.
You were teaching Rebecca how to cook?

21:56.399 --> 22:00.026
- I was trying to.
- So, you two were friends?

22:00.152 --> 22:02.028
Yeah. Yeah, we were.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.115
- They were bestest buddies.
- Let it go, Herrmann.

22:05.241 --> 22:09.369
He apologises for what he said,
I'll let it go.

22:09.495 --> 22:12.038
You know, I...
I see a lot of your dad in you.

22:12.164 --> 22:15.208
He was a pretty caring guy, too.

22:18.754 --> 22:22.549
- Did you know him well?
- Not as well as I wish I had.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.639
Hey. What's the matter, Clarke,
you lost?

22:29.765 --> 22:34.728
Don't be like that.
I had to transfer out.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.813
- I had no choice.
- Why?

22:39.275 --> 22:44.738
You made Lieutenant.
I didn't even know you took the test.

22:44.864 --> 22:48.324
You son of a gun!
Congratulations!

22:48.451 --> 22:49.909
Why didn't you say anything?

22:50.036 --> 22:52.203
You're waiting for
your promotion to come through.

22:52.329 --> 22:54.831
- I didn't want it to get awkward.
- With you it's always awkward.

22:56.542 --> 22:59.169
I'm happy for you, buddy.
Come here.

23:00.296 --> 23:05.091
- Yeah, I don't like people touching me.
- See? Awkward.

23:08.596 --> 23:12.766
- Look who it is.
- To what do we owe the honour?

23:12.892 --> 23:16.895
Just checking in on you guys.
This whole thing with Jones, you know.

23:17.021 --> 23:20.523
Yeah, it's, er...
It's unbelievable, right?

23:22.151 --> 23:25.862
Unbelievable. I'm working with
her oldest brother now, Brandon.

23:25.988 --> 23:28.448
And, er, this poor guy's beside himself.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.118
That reminds me,
from the guys at 25.

23:32.244 --> 23:35.121
Hey! Awesome. Thank you, Clarke.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.792
I hope Jones' brothers
don't let their dad off too easy.

23:38.918 --> 23:42.420
- Gabby...
- I don't care if it's inappropriate.

23:42.546 --> 23:43.671
I won't keep my mouth shut.

23:43.798 --> 23:47.467
Please tell me someone's taking him
to task for what he did to Jones.

23:47.593 --> 23:50.386
Dawson, we were ready
to go to bat for her.

23:50.513 --> 23:51.846
It was up to her to stand up to him...

23:51.972 --> 23:54.682
He wore her down! OK?

23:57.103 --> 24:00.980
All she wanted out of life
was to be a fire-fighter,

24:01.107 --> 24:07.320
and she did it despite his constant
discouragement and interference.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.073
But he still had to
take that away from her.

24:14.411 --> 24:18.623
Look, all Brandon said about it was that
she had depression her whole life.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.542
Really?

24:20.668 --> 24:25.171
Apparently she tried this once before,
when she was 16.

24:26.423 --> 24:30.468
And knowing that, he still bullied her?

24:30.594 --> 24:33.513
He still berated her?
Pushed her to the brink?

24:33.639 --> 24:34.973
Dawson...

24:35.099 --> 24:38.560
We're talking about
a Deputy District Chief.

24:41.188 --> 24:43.189
You better keep that man
far away from me,

24:43.315 --> 24:46.192
because if I see him,
he's getting both barrels.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.749
Donna.

25:04.461 --> 25:07.422
- Hey.
- Wallace.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.217
Here's the thing.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.678
I run into burning buildings
for a living,

25:13.804 --> 25:17.765
but I run away from relationships.

25:17.892 --> 25:25.023
And I guess I just...
I got scared, Donna.

25:25.149 --> 25:29.611
And now, you were the best thing
that happened to me...

25:29.737 --> 25:32.030
I can't get into this right now.

25:32.156 --> 25:37.410
I, er, I have a meeting with
the administration.

25:37.536 --> 25:43.541
I can come back later... after my shift.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.669
I'll think about it.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.068
- Hey.
- Shh.

26:25.376 --> 26:28.586
- What are you doing?
- Hmm? Nothing.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.510
You're in business.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.641
Oh, so I should just
paint a little white line

26:41.767 --> 26:43.518
down the fridge, his side, my side?

26:43.644 --> 26:46.020
Yo, I didn't freak out when
he drank all the orange juice.

26:46.146 --> 26:47.814
This was
a really nice piece of walleye.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.566
- Just call it fish!
- And you left the dishes for me!

26:50.693 --> 26:53.778
Have you two ever considered that maybe
you've been roommates for too long?

26:53.904 --> 26:56.781
Oh, we just moved in together.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.034
You want to pick this back up later?

27:06.333 --> 27:08.960
You know, I don't need Judge Judy
in my firehouse.

27:09.086 --> 27:11.212
- Wallace...
- I need someone who can be there

27:11.338 --> 27:14.549
for my people, offer them support,
spiritual guidance,

27:14.675 --> 27:15.967
actually get them to open up.

27:16.093 --> 27:19.262
I can't order your men to open up,
Chief.

27:19.388 --> 27:21.222
They have to find their own way.

27:21.348 --> 27:24.767
You left Henry Mills
to find his own way.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.728
As I recall, he never quite found it.

27:28.355 --> 27:31.316
Wallace, you've been holding that
against me for a long time.

27:31.442 --> 27:34.736
He was trying to repair a broken
marriage, needed someone to lean on.

27:34.862 --> 27:37.780
It couldn't be me, obvious reasons,
which is why I asked you to talk to him.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.782
And I had every intention of doing so.

27:39.908 --> 27:43.202
If he hadn't walked into that fire
carrying so much anger,

27:43.329 --> 27:46.998
he just might have
walked back out again.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.796
You know what I think?

27:55.466 --> 28:00.178
- I think you lost a good man that day.
- He was a friend.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.390
And, er...

28:04.516 --> 28:06.934
I wonder if losing Rebecca Jones

28:07.061 --> 28:09.562
has brought back
some of the guilt that you felt

28:09.688 --> 28:11.981
about Henry Mills' death.

28:17.279 --> 28:23.451
Chaplain, if you can't help my people,
get out of my firehouse.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.256
Hey, Chief, you OK?

29:05.786 --> 29:07.036
Chief Jones?

29:17.381 --> 29:18.881
I brought Rebecca's things.

29:22.428 --> 29:26.347
I just wanted to offer
our deepest condolences

29:26.473 --> 29:28.474
on behalf of everyone at 51.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.729
And also to say...

29:36.442 --> 29:39.735
...she would have made
a great fire-fighter.

29:43.866 --> 29:46.409
I was trying to protect her.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.748
I didn't think she could handle
the stress of the job.

29:55.752 --> 29:59.005
I was only trying to protect her.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.219
Instead...

30:09.391 --> 30:12.768
Ambulance 61,
take in a traffic accident at...

30:21.028 --> 30:23.321
I'm very sorry, Chief.

30:34.124 --> 30:38.503
We got a driver pinned in the car,
hurt but conscious.

30:39.338 --> 30:40.505
What about the bus?

30:40.631 --> 30:43.424
Er, kids on their way to the prom banged
up, but nothing too serious.

30:43.550 --> 30:46.552
Casey, Severide,
we have a pin-in in the grey car.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.346
- Get them out.
- Copy that.

30:48.472 --> 30:49.639
Dawson, check on the victim.

30:49.765 --> 30:52.308
- Shay, assess these kids.
- On it.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.602
All right, whoever's injured,
I want to take a look at you.

30:55.479 --> 30:57.438
Hang in there, sir,
we're gonna get you out, OK?

31:01.193 --> 31:04.737
- Casey, we're good.
- All right! Let's move this car.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.240
Ready? Lift!

31:07.366 --> 31:08.741
Ready? Lift!

31:08.867 --> 31:10.493
Ready? Lift!

31:10.619 --> 31:11.661
Ready? Lift!

31:11.787 --> 31:13.162
- I don't know where Paige is.
- Huh?

31:13.288 --> 31:14.747
You guys, where's Paige?

31:14.873 --> 31:17.625
- Mouch, Otis, check the bus.
- Yep.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.461
Sweetie, have a seat here.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.675
Where was she sitting?

31:25.801 --> 31:27.552
I don't know.
We were all goofing around.

31:27.678 --> 31:29.095
Then we hit something,

31:29.221 --> 31:32.807
and the bus started swerving
and that's when I hit my head.

31:34.309 --> 31:37.812
- There's nobody else in here.
- Why is this window open?

31:37.938 --> 31:40.189
Oh, no. Chief!

31:41.358 --> 31:44.527
- I think somebody was ejected!
- Oh, my God.

31:51.660 --> 31:51.701
The girl could have fallen out
wherever the bus first lost control.

31:51.702 --> 31:54.704
The girl could have fallen out
wherever the bus first lost control.

31:54.830 --> 31:57.206
We are going to shut down the road,
run a search.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.542
My guys have been up this road,
they didn't see anything.

31:59.668 --> 32:01.460
We should have some
fire-fighters take a look.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.546
Be my guest,
but I can't close this road.

32:03.672 --> 32:06.549
You do realise you have
a girl that is unaccounted for?

32:06.675 --> 32:10.011
Yes, but my guess is that she got out
with the others and she wandered off.

32:10.137 --> 32:12.805
You have an open emergency exit!
Somebody was ejected!

32:12.931 --> 32:15.099
- Chief, let me talk to him.
- I'm shutting down this road!

32:15.225 --> 32:18.102
- I can't let you do that.
- Truck 81, block off this road.

32:18.228 --> 32:21.981
- Last warning, Chief.
- Go ahead, Cruz.

32:25.861 --> 32:29.196
Mouch, Herrmann, Otis!
Fan out, search back along the road!

32:29.323 --> 32:33.200
This is my scene, Chief.
Are you really gonna make me arrest you?

32:33.327 --> 32:36.037
You're just gonna have to do
what the hell you need to do.

32:39.249 --> 32:40.875
Really?

32:46.173 --> 32:49.383
- You've got to be kidding me.
- You picked the wrong cop to piss off.

32:49.509 --> 32:51.636
Oh, I haven't even started on you.

32:53.096 --> 32:55.890
- You seeing this?
- Yes, I am, Chief.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.817
I got her!

33:06.943 --> 33:10.446
I got her!
We need a backboard and a black bag!

33:10.572 --> 33:12.573
- Yeah, I'm on it.
- Is she OK?

33:12.699 --> 33:14.659
She's in good hands, just hold tight.

33:17.287 --> 33:22.500
Officer Woodall? Is this really
the hill you want to die on?

33:32.135 --> 33:34.095
Whoa, watch her arm.

33:34.221 --> 33:37.682
I got it. Stay out of my way.

33:40.811 --> 33:42.186
Come on.

33:45.065 --> 33:46.607
Paige!

33:46.733 --> 33:47.942
I'm OK.

33:50.696 --> 33:53.239
Hey. No harm, no foul.

34:12.217 --> 34:17.179
- After you. I insist.
- Hey!

34:17.305 --> 34:19.765
Whatever's going on between you two,
can you drop it?

34:19.891 --> 34:22.184
I'll drop it when he apologises.

34:22.310 --> 34:24.311
Apologise for what?
For speaking the truth?

34:24.438 --> 34:26.605
Knock it off, both of you.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.525
Yeah? He's saying that
we made Jones suicidal

34:29.651 --> 34:31.402
- and I'm supposed to swallow that?
- No! No!

34:31.528 --> 34:33.988
Just own up to your behaviour

34:34.114 --> 34:37.158
and admit that you could have
handled things better!

34:37.284 --> 34:39.702
- How dare you!
- Herrmann!

34:39.828 --> 34:41.954
I was the last one to see her alive!

34:42.080 --> 34:45.249
You think I didn't wonder
over and over again

34:45.375 --> 34:47.793
what I might have done different?

34:47.919 --> 34:51.464
What else I might have said
that would have changed her mind?

34:53.967 --> 34:57.011
Is this what you all took
from what I said this morning?

34:59.347 --> 35:02.057
Is this really how
we're gonna get through this thing?

35:08.106 --> 35:09.815
Severide?

35:09.941 --> 35:11.734
Bloom is inside.

35:13.153 --> 35:16.322
Sorry, Chief.
I got one more save to make tonight.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.201
Hey.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.162
See where those guys are.

35:25.207 --> 35:29.126
Well, I guess I'm gonna get a lecture
about skipping out on rehab.

35:29.252 --> 35:30.836
Let's get it over with.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.630
No, Bloom.
I got no more lectures for you.

35:32.756 --> 35:34.799
Yeah? Then give me my wallet.

35:34.925 --> 35:38.552
Just relax,
Capp's getting it from my locker.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.348
What are you all looking at?

35:45.393 --> 35:47.394
What, you need an audience?

35:49.898 --> 35:52.107
You ruined my white board.
That was permanent ink.

35:52.234 --> 35:56.654
- I'll get you another one.
- What is this?

35:56.780 --> 35:58.197
I know. I'm not staying.

35:58.323 --> 36:01.033
Severide asked me
to pick these two up at O'Hare.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.869
- Chaplain.
- Lieutenant.

36:03.995 --> 36:07.331
This is Damien and this is Aaron.

36:07.457 --> 36:09.667
- Screw this.
- Bloom, just give me one second.

36:09.793 --> 36:12.419
You are a son of a bitch.

36:14.464 --> 36:16.924
- Hey, it's not like that, Captain.
- Oh. Captain!

36:17.926 --> 36:19.927
Captain. Aren't you cute?

36:22.806 --> 36:24.139
You can mail me my wallet.

36:24.266 --> 36:27.017
We didn't know what happened to you,
Bloom.

36:28.645 --> 36:29.937
Now you do.

36:30.063 --> 36:31.856
We're sorry.

36:33.108 --> 36:35.067
That's what we came to tell you.

36:35.193 --> 36:40.030
The way we treated you back in Denver,
you got to understand, we were upset.

36:40.156 --> 36:43.033
Oh, you were upset.

36:43.159 --> 36:45.995
You were upset.
I was the Captain!

36:46.121 --> 36:50.124
Those were my men in there!
They were my men!

36:50.250 --> 36:52.835
We said a lot of awful things
in the heat of the moment.

36:52.961 --> 36:55.754
But we had a lot of time
to think about it.

36:57.299 --> 37:00.467
We were wrong.
You made the right call.

37:01.761 --> 37:02.970
If you would have let us inside,

37:03.096 --> 37:06.015
we would've still been in there
when the roof came down.

37:06.141 --> 37:09.018
There's no question,
you saved our lives.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.980
Your boy could only
afford two plane tickets,

37:13.106 --> 37:15.274
otherwise there would have been
a dozen of us here.

37:16.526 --> 37:17.693
We all feel the same way.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.995
This is my daughter, Lily.

37:29.164 --> 37:33.709
She wouldn't exist
if you hadn't tackled me that day.

37:35.170 --> 37:37.296
Cos I was going in, Captain.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.467
I was going in.

38:16.044 --> 38:18.128
It's not easy losing a fire-fighter.

38:21.216 --> 38:22.967
I've lost my fair share.

38:23.802 --> 38:27.346
81 alone, Andy Darden, Rebecca Jones.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.975
I can't imagine.

38:32.978 --> 38:36.563
You came here today to help.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.275
I gave you a hard time.

38:42.737 --> 38:46.949
I get it, Chief.
You're just looking out for your house.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.252
They're all that I got.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.615
Talk to me.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.872
I'm scared.

39:37.125 --> 39:38.584
Of what?

39:43.423 --> 39:45.215
Everything.

39:47.343 --> 39:48.761
The future.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.975
I don't know what's gonna happen, Matt.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.981
That's why they call it the future.

40:03.860 --> 40:06.820
One thing I know will happen for sure...

40:09.282 --> 40:11.700
...you and I are gonna face it together.

40:40.605 --> 40:41.814
Donna.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.942
Wallace, I owe you an explanation.

40:45.068 --> 40:48.028
No, no, I owe you an explanation.

40:48.154 --> 40:51.365
Please, just listen.

40:51.491 --> 40:53.659
You need to understand
where my head's at.

40:55.537 --> 40:57.371
When you pulled the plug
on our relationship,

40:57.497 --> 40:59.498
I had to assume that
I'd never see you again.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.834
So, erm...

41:03.461 --> 41:07.756
...I need you to imagine how tough
it's been this past week,

41:07.882 --> 41:11.844
ever since I found out that
I'm carrying your baby.

41:41.416 --> 41:43.000
For Jones.
