- YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO GO TO DETROIT

09:19.159 --> 09:20.525
FOR MY GRANDMAMA'S
80TH BIRTHDAY PARTY.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.093
THEN YOU PASSED OUT.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.828
I THOUGHT IT WAS WEIRD BECAUSE
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HER.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.064

BOBBY SENT ME HERE
TO GET MORE POTTED MEAT.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.775
HE'S TOO SCARED
TO GO OUTSIDE.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.811
- WHY'S HE AFRAID
TO GO OUTSIDE?

10:12.813 --> 10:14.279
- BECAUSE BOBBY FOUND A DEED
FROM THE OLDEN DAYS,

10:14.281 --> 10:15.981
AND THEN HE KICKED THEM
RANGERS' ASSES OUT,

10:15.983 --> 10:17.749
AND THEN THEY CAME BACK
AND TRIED TO GET US TO LEAVE,

10:17.751 --> 10:19.718
AND WE SAID NO, AND THEN
BOBBY THREW THAT FAT FELLA

10:19.720 --> 10:21.219
AND THAT GIRL WITH
THE BLONDE HAIR INTO THE MUD,

10:21.221 --> 10:22.921
AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS MAKEUP,
BUT IT WAS PIG SHIT.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.956
NOW EVERYBODY'S LIVING THERE
IN THEIR TRAILERS

10:24.958 --> 10:26.891
AND CAMPING FOR FREE 'CAUSE
BOBBY'S NOT CHARGIN' NO RENT.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.660
BUT HE TOLD ME NOT SAY NOTHIN',
THEN HE SLAPPED ME ON THE HEAD

10:28.662 --> 10:30.895
SO HARD IT MADE MY PETER
SHRINK BACK UP INSIDE ME.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.597
- HOLD ON, HE AIN'T CHARGIN'
NO RENT?

10:32.599 --> 10:34.065
- YEAH, BUT I'M SMART,
SO I DIDN'T TELL NOBODY.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.001
HOW MUCH I OWE YOU
FOR THE POTTED MEAT, AUBREY?

10:36.003 --> 10:38.003

BODEAN, IT'S ON THE HOUSE.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.804
- THANKS, AUBREY.
I SURE APPRECIATE IT

'CAUSE BOBBY REALLY LIKES
POTTED MEAT WITH SALTINES,

10:41.675 --> 10:42.841

I GET THE SHITS

10:45.245 --> 10:47.078

WHAT WIFI WAS...
