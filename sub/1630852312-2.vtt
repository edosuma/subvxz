WEBVTT

00:05.222 --> 00:06.745
- Okay, so we all like
this bar,

00:06.789 --> 00:07.703
and we're all interested

00:07.746 --> 00:08.704
in getting more into wine.

00:08.747 --> 00:10.314
Agreed?
all: Agreed.

00:10.358 --> 00:12.447
- Well, I think to ensure that
this remains the go-to spot,

00:12.490 --> 00:13.839
we need to set
some ground rules.

00:13.883 --> 00:14.840
I'll go first.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.059
Ground rule number one,

00:16.103 --> 00:18.975
Noah cannot date
anybody that works here.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.498
- Okay.
Okay, yeah, I can do that.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.326
- Ground rule number two,
Noah cannot introduce himself

00:22.370 --> 00:23.414
to anyone who works here.

00:23.458 --> 00:24.850
It's a slippery slope.
- Mm-hmm.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.243
- Then the bartenders are
gonna think I'm mean.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.244
- Okay,
then just the tip them more.

00:27.288 --> 00:28.593
Ooh, I got one.

00:28.637 --> 00:30.856
Ground rule number three,
Noah can't even date

00:30.900 --> 00:32.380
anyone in the immediate area,

00:32.423 --> 00:34.121
'cause that'll prevent
awkward run-ins.

00:34.164 --> 00:35.687
- How are we defining
the immediate area?

00:35.731 --> 00:36.688
- Fantastic question.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.081
Ground rule number four,

00:38.125 --> 00:40.127
the immediate area
is a one-mile radius.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.215
- For real?
- Yes.

00:41.258 --> 00:42.694
- I like that.
- Come on, y'all.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.174
Can we please make up a ground
rule about someone else?

00:44.218 --> 00:45.523
- Okay,
this one's for all of us.

00:45.567 --> 00:48.178
Ground rule number five,
if anybody complains

00:48.222 --> 00:50.311
about the ground rules,
they got to buy a round.

00:50.354 --> 00:52.356
- That's it right there.
- I see what you did there.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.618
- But no one else
is gonna complain

00:53.662 --> 00:55.403
because all the ground rules
are about me.

00:55.446 --> 00:56.665
- Sounds like
a complaint to me.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.101
- Damn it,
I just bought this round.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.363
- Another complaint,
another round.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.713
- This is unfair.
- Another one.

01:01.757 --> 01:04.412
- I'm gonna stop
because I cannot afford this.

01:05.761 --> 01:07.502
It's just that y'all--
all: Another one.

01:47.063 --> 01:49.718
- Very funny, but, you know,
I've been single before,

01:49.761 --> 01:51.415
and I'm not always
looking for love.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.765
- Okay, stop the show.
I'm your sister.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.289
I've seen you in the tub.
- What's that mean?

01:55.332 --> 01:57.117
- We were bucky
as babies together.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.466
I know your truth.

01:58.509 --> 02:00.381
You are always
trying to be boo'd up.

02:00.424 --> 02:02.600
That's why you are so obsessed
with rom-coms.

02:02.644 --> 02:03.906
You think
they're how life should be.

02:03.949 --> 02:06.474
- So what?
I may prefer companionship,

02:06.517 --> 02:08.432
and I have a taste
for romantically-based films.

02:08.476 --> 02:10.608
What is so bad about that?

02:10.652 --> 02:12.436
- Remember your
"Love & Basketball" fiasco?

02:12.480 --> 02:14.177
- I'll play you.
- For what?

02:14.221 --> 02:15.700
- Your heart.

02:24.883 --> 02:26.146

02:26.189 --> 02:27.234
- That love would win
in the end.

02:27.277 --> 02:28.278
- You're dumb.

02:28.322 --> 02:29.453
You need to stop
looking for love

02:29.497 --> 02:30.715
every second of the day.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.282
You need to learn
how to love yourself.

02:32.326 --> 02:33.631
You know what you need.
- What?

02:33.675 --> 02:34.980
- Self-care.

02:35.024 --> 02:36.156
- I self-care constantly.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.374
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

02:37.418 --> 02:38.767
As a matter of fact,
I'm taking myself out

02:38.810 --> 02:40.116

02:40.160 --> 02:42.292
Just me and an empty seat
across from the table.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.989
And you know what?
I was thinking

02:44.033 --> 02:45.295
I'll maybe even do a Sudoku.

Oh.

Anthony.

02:57.742 --> 02:58.874
- What was that?
- Explain that.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.397
- I'm just saying hey
to my friend.

03:00.441 --> 03:02.051
- Nah, look at your posture.
Y'all are too erect.

03:02.094 --> 03:03.400
Something's up.
- Fine.

03:04.749 --> 03:08.188
This afternoon, I caught
Anthony here in the bathroom.

03:08.231 --> 03:09.885
- Naked?
- Worse.

03:11.756 --> 03:14.063
- Oh, God.
Are you crying?

03:14.106 --> 03:15.282
- [sniffles]
Look away.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.588
- I don't understand.
So crying is worse

03:17.632 --> 03:18.894
than seeing
someone's genitalia?

03:18.937 --> 03:22.680
- Way worse.
He saw my emotional genitalia.

03:22.724 --> 03:23.942
It's one thing
to cry on your own,

03:23.986 --> 03:25.161

03:25.205 --> 03:27.642
Nah.
Real Gs cry in silence.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.296
- Back up.
Why were you crying?

03:29.339 --> 03:30.645
- I had just watched
"Paddington 2."

03:30.688 --> 03:32.473
- The kid's movie
with the talking bear?

03:32.516 --> 03:34.953
both: It has adult themes.
- Thank you, Noah.

03:34.997 --> 03:36.868
That damn bear really made me
feel some things.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.435
- Y'all are being ridiculous.
This is silly.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.089
- Man, you ain't seen
what I've seen.

03:40.132 --> 03:41.395
Can't shake the sight.

03:41.438 --> 03:44.267
Those bare,
glistening, wet cheeks

03:44.311 --> 03:45.703
on his face.

03:45.747 --> 03:47.879
- You said
they weren't that wet.

- I lied.

Hi. What are you doing here?

03:56.932 --> 03:59.282
- Well, I was in the area.
I remembered your little lunch.

03:59.326 --> 04:00.979
I figured I'd drop by

Hi.
- Aww.

04:02.198 --> 04:03.199
That's really nice of you.

Um, I would offer you a seat,

Myself, Nicky.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.642
You're here
trying to meet a girl.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.427

I'm interested in meeting

04:13.470 --> 04:14.906
is a better me.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.908
What are you doing?
- Sherlocking your ass.

04:16.952 --> 04:20.085
You got a weathered moleskin
to make yourself seem artistic,

Oh, we got a book.

I did all that stuff for me.

- Yeah, right?
