00:42.914 --> 00:46.334
Hey, Damien, what you gonna do
when the space war is over?

00:46.418 --> 00:49.486
Open a Lady Foot Locker,
hang myself in the back.

00:49.538 --> 00:51.022
You know, take it easy.

00:53.191 --> 00:55.426
It's an ambush!

01:14.413 --> 01:16.747
They're everywhere!

01:16.815 --> 01:19.650
Tell my wife that I loved you.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.250
Just in time, Phillip.

01:36.318 --> 01:38.269
Dino-sorry we're late.

01:38.336 --> 01:40.304
You guys really
saved our asses.

01:40.372 --> 01:42.540
You mean your cabooses.

01:42.607 --> 01:44.008
Train!

01:44.076 --> 01:45.176
I'm a train!

01:47.312 --> 01:49.914
Dad, I was playing there!

01:49.981 --> 01:52.116
That's why I threw my
briefcase on top of it.

01:52.184 --> 01:54.101
The symbolism is
just too delicious.

01:54.169 --> 01:55.986
Adulthood is crashing
down on you, Steve.

01:56.054 --> 01:57.721
You're too old to be
playing with toys.

01:57.773 --> 01:59.006
What?

01:59.074 --> 02:01.158
You're never too old to play.

02:01.226 --> 02:02.927
Using your imagination's
a healthy way

02:02.994 --> 02:04.812
to escape reality for a spell.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.714
No, that's what drugs
and alcohol are for.

02:06.782 --> 02:09.265
Steve, you're 14;
no more make-believe.

02:09.334 --> 02:10.851
But I love making believe.

02:10.919 --> 02:13.237
Well, it's time to give all
that up and become an adult.

02:13.305 --> 02:15.072
Never!

02:15.140 --> 02:17.374
Jet pack activate!

02:17.426 --> 02:19.977
To forever and above!

02:29.387 --> 02:31.755
You're a dick, Steve.

02:33.708 --> 02:35.459
Ugh, I don't have
the fingers for this.

02:35.527 --> 02:37.478
I have the fingers
for a lot of things...

02:37.562 --> 02:40.448
Seasoning pizza dough,
snapping along to R&B songs,

02:40.515 --> 02:41.782
finger banging.

02:41.867 --> 02:43.501
Bang-bang! Bang-bang!

02:43.568 --> 02:44.902
Good, right?

02:44.970 --> 02:47.138
Not at first but then
yes, it got very good.

02:47.205 --> 02:48.139
Damn, bitch!

02:48.206 --> 02:49.540
What happened to you?

02:49.608 --> 02:52.810
I slipped at the market
and landed on my head and nose.

02:52.878 --> 02:55.312
The manager was so scared
I was gonna sue,

02:55.380 --> 02:58.382
he gave me free steaks!

03:00.385 --> 03:02.853
Smart. There's no way
a lawsuit could have been

03:02.921 --> 03:05.322
more lucrative than
two supermarket steaks.

03:05.390 --> 03:08.008
Right. So I was thinking,
Stan's working late,

03:08.076 --> 03:10.928
how 'bout I cook up a nice
steak dinner for the two of us?

03:10.996 --> 03:13.264
Hey! Fun!

03:13.331 --> 03:14.965
Not a lot of fun, but enough.

03:15.033 --> 03:16.267
What can I bring?

03:16.334 --> 03:18.536
Mm, maybe a nice
bottle of wine?

03:18.603 --> 03:20.821
Oh, you bitch.

03:20.889 --> 03:22.289
You did it.

03:22.357 --> 03:24.525
Stupid, stupid bitch

03:24.609 --> 03:26.026
doesn't even know.

03:26.111 --> 03:28.245
She is gonna get
the best bottle of wine

03:28.313 --> 03:30.164
of her stupid bitch life.

03:31.783 --> 03:34.869
She-she doesn't even know!

03:44.346 --> 03:45.279
Oh, no.

03:45.347 --> 03:46.547
Where's the Rain Duck?

03:46.615 --> 03:48.449
Damn it, all out.
Got to hit the store.

03:48.517 --> 03:50.401
But what car to take?

03:57.008 --> 03:59.927
Ah, '97 Toyota Camry.

03:59.995 --> 04:02.446
Only 32 made in the world.

04:13.742 --> 04:15.809
Maybe I'll take my bike.

04:15.877 --> 04:18.212
Such a nice day.

04:21.048 --> 04:23.284
<i>Now stay tuned</i>
<i>for</i> Jimmy Kimmel Live.

04:23.351 --> 04:25.085
Oh, man!

04:25.153 --> 04:26.971
This is gonna be so good.
I need this.

04:27.038 --> 04:28.806
I don't know if you've
picked up on my vibe lately,

04:28.874 --> 04:30.174
but I've been pretty upset.

04:30.242 --> 04:31.842
Steve won't stop
playing with toys.

04:31.910 --> 04:33.310
Oh, you're bugging, huh?

04:33.378 --> 04:34.812
Yeah, but not for long.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.614
Because tonight,
when Steve's asleep,

04:36.681 --> 04:38.949
I'm gonna go in
and get rid of all his toys.

04:39.017 --> 04:40.301
Nice.

04:46.024 --> 04:47.557
Ninety-eight-point-six.

04:47.609 --> 04:48.993
I'm telling you, I feel warm.

04:49.060 --> 04:50.411
Check it again.

05:03.858 --> 05:04.992
Evening, Robbie.

05:05.060 --> 05:06.710
Any intelligence to report?

05:06.778 --> 05:08.145
Tonight, when Steve's asleep,

05:08.213 --> 05:10.414
I'm gonna go in
and get rid of all his toys.

05:10.482 --> 05:12.650
Oh, dear Lord.

05:12.717 --> 05:14.802
I knew this day would come.

05:14.869 --> 05:17.671
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention.

05:17.739 --> 05:21.875
Tonight, we fight for our lives!

05:25.146 --> 05:27.665
Yeah!

05:35.090 --> 05:36.724
String on tail.

05:36.791 --> 05:38.409
Obviously, that's nothing.

05:39.461 --> 05:40.327
Ooh!

05:47.385 --> 05:48.919
Steve, h-hand over
the gun, okay?

05:48.987 --> 05:50.254
L-Let's talk.

05:50.322 --> 05:53.057
I think we'll leave the talk
to Tavis Smiley,

05:53.124 --> 05:54.758
weeknights on PBS.

06:10.592 --> 06:11.959
Good job, men.

06:12.027 --> 06:14.795
Our victory was hard-fought
and well-deserved.

06:14.863 --> 06:17.698
Please, make the pain go away.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.855
I, uh, think he meant,
like, an Advil.

06:27.542 --> 06:29.510
What am I gonna do about Steve?

06:29.577 --> 06:30.978
He's gonna play
with toys forever!

06:31.046 --> 06:32.846
Calm down.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.615
Steve will leave
his toys behind

06:34.683 --> 06:36.817
when he gets interested
in adult things.

06:36.885 --> 06:38.719
What, like,
mung beans and regret?

06:38.787 --> 06:41.321
No. <i>Sex.</i>

06:41.389 --> 06:44.224
As soon as Steve
gets a taste of vachooch,

06:44.292 --> 06:46.493
those toys will be
a thing of the past.

06:46.561 --> 06:48.062
But that could take forever.

06:48.129 --> 06:51.098
Steve is not a... sensual boy.

06:51.166 --> 06:54.034
No, but my cologne is.

06:58.339 --> 07:01.275
<i>Sensual Boy by Klaus.</i>

07:01.342 --> 07:04.411
Smell it.

07:07.182 --> 07:10.517
And that's why it's virtually
impossible for me to get fired,

07:10.585 --> 07:11.985
no matter what I do.

07:12.053 --> 07:13.604
Hi-ya!

07:15.740 --> 07:17.775
Karate.

07:17.842 --> 07:19.943
Steve, get up.
We're going to Mexico.

07:20.011 --> 07:22.212
I'm taking you to a whorehouse
to get you laid.

07:22.280 --> 07:25.115
Uh, okay.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.851
Didn't see my day
going this way, but good, okay.

07:37.345 --> 07:39.930
Hi-ya!

07:43.805 --> 07:46.140
Now, son, these Mexican
call girls have seen

07:46.224 --> 07:48.809
thousands of men, so when
they tell you you're the best

07:48.894 --> 07:50.895
they've ever had,
it's quite a compliment.

07:50.946 --> 07:51.896
Steve?

07:51.947 --> 07:53.230
You all right, Philip?

07:53.281 --> 07:55.116
You look a little green.

07:56.585 --> 07:58.452
Hey! Where'd that
toy come from?!

07:58.520 --> 08:00.071
You got to have a road toy.

08:00.122 --> 08:01.789
Son, I am bringing
you to Mexico

08:01.857 --> 08:03.624
to show you that you
don't need toys anymore!

08:03.709 --> 08:05.710
And by the way,
father of the year here.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.795
This is how I wish
I lost my virginity.

08:07.879 --> 08:09.397
Not to some coked-up airhead.

08:09.464 --> 08:11.082
Didn't you lose
your virginity to Mom?

08:11.133 --> 08:12.349
Mm-hmm.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.342
Roget!

08:21.410 --> 08:23.277
Seb!

08:28.700 --> 08:33.037
Seb, <i>mon ami,</i> a sweet stupid
lady has invited me for steaks,

08:33.105 --> 08:35.339
and only a bottle
of Rain Duck will do.

08:35.407 --> 08:37.541
<i>Oh, je regrette.</i>

08:37.609 --> 08:39.643
They are no longer
making the Rain Duck,

08:39.711 --> 08:42.613
and we just sold
our last bottle.

08:42.681 --> 08:44.148
What? To who?!

08:44.216 --> 08:46.217
To the homosexual news team.

08:46.284 --> 08:48.385
Oh, my God, Greg and Terry--
they love me!

08:48.453 --> 08:49.653
They'll totally
give me that bottle!

09:07.355 --> 09:09.573
<i>Hola.</i>

09:09.641 --> 09:11.175
Business or pleasure?

09:11.243 --> 09:14.612
Buying pleasure is my business.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.013
Oh!

09:16.081 --> 09:21.385
Oh-ho-ho, ho-ho-ho!

09:21.453 --> 09:23.020
Yes.

09:23.088 --> 09:26.357
Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha,

09:26.424 --> 09:28.375
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

09:28.443 --> 09:31.979
Hee! He-he-he-he, he-he!

09:32.047 --> 09:33.147
Steve, what are you doing?

09:33.215 --> 09:34.598
Just trying to get in on it.

09:34.666 --> 09:36.033
Well, don't.

09:36.101 --> 09:38.335
You're embarrassing me
in front of my best friend.

09:42.090 --> 09:44.675
Hey, Terry, it's me--
Wait, who do you know me as?

09:44.743 --> 09:45.976
Stan's Uncle Roger.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.711
Good for me
for keeping it simple.

09:47.779 --> 09:51.315
So, the guys over at the wine
store accidentally sold you

09:51.383 --> 09:53.684
a bottle of Rain Duck
they were holding for me.

09:53.752 --> 09:55.085
I'll just grab the wine,

09:55.153 --> 09:58.122
and in return, I will
give you back your garage keys.

09:58.190 --> 10:00.291
I sometimes sleep
under your car.

10:00.358 --> 10:02.660
Like a cat or a meth addict.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.695
I'm not a cat.

10:06.298 --> 10:08.098
Listen, <i>we</i> bought
the Rain Duck.

10:08.166 --> 10:09.934
It's <i>our</i> Rain Duck.

10:10.001 --> 10:12.887
You're out of luck.
You're out of Duck.

10:14.523 --> 10:16.223
Good one, T!

10:16.291 --> 10:17.875
Oh. Well.

10:17.943 --> 10:19.677
That's surely the last
you'll hear from me

10:19.744 --> 10:20.678
regarding this matter.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.880
Good day.

10:22.948 --> 10:25.933
Francine, postpone the steaks!

10:26.017 --> 10:27.501
Are you talking to me?!

10:27.569 --> 10:30.104
You have to talk louder
if you want me to hear you!

10:30.171 --> 10:32.006
I said postpone the steaks!

10:32.073 --> 10:33.407
I don't have the wine!

10:33.475 --> 10:35.326
Can't we just drink
a different wine?!

10:35.393 --> 10:36.377
You're getting a punch!

10:36.444 --> 10:37.695
What?!

10:37.762 --> 10:39.830
When I get over there,
I'm going to punch you!

10:39.898 --> 10:41.382
Please don't!
Two punches!

10:41.449 --> 10:42.950
What?! Why?!

10:43.018 --> 10:44.485
I'm gonna keep adding punches.

10:50.425 --> 10:51.725
Here we are, son.

10:51.793 --> 10:53.861
Behind that door lies a goddess

10:53.929 --> 10:55.729
who will usher you
into adulthood.

10:55.797 --> 10:57.498
Man, I'm excited.

10:57.566 --> 10:58.899
Sh-Should I,
should I get one, too?

10:58.967 --> 11:00.017
Sh-Should-- no, no.

11:00.085 --> 11:01.852
I mean, maybe. I mean, no, no.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.387
I don't know, I don't know,
probably.

11:11.062 --> 11:13.647
<i>Quieres sex?</i>

11:17.235 --> 11:18.152
Whew!

11:18.236 --> 11:19.336
That was unexpected.

11:19.404 --> 11:21.338
Was she... was that...

11:21.406 --> 11:22.907
was she cooking?

11:22.974 --> 11:24.825
I-I don't know what
the plan was for that tortilla.

11:26.444 --> 11:29.163
Not to worry though, plenty of
first-class cathouses down here.

11:29.247 --> 11:30.364
We'll just go to another.

11:32.867 --> 11:36.470
Now, this is more like it, eh?

11:38.006 --> 11:40.641
Take your pick of the ladies.

11:40.709 --> 11:42.576
Line up, girls!

11:43.878 --> 11:46.246
Pick me! Pick me!

11:46.314 --> 11:50.851
No, pick me, Papi,
I do it better!

11:57.042 --> 11:58.609
What he hell's
going on down here?

11:58.677 --> 12:00.844
Well, son, I guess
finding a good brothel

12:00.912 --> 12:02.713
is a bit like "Goldilocks
and the Three Bears."

12:02.781 --> 12:05.349
I'm sure the third one
will be just right.

12:10.555 --> 12:11.622
I was wrong!

12:11.690 --> 12:13.157
The third one was the worst!

12:33.912 --> 12:34.878
<i>Horchata!</i>

12:34.946 --> 12:37.047
<i>Horchata deliciosa!</i>

12:37.115 --> 12:39.116
Dad, this is awful.

12:39.184 --> 12:40.351
Can we go home?

12:40.418 --> 12:41.719
You think I'm not upset?

12:41.786 --> 12:43.754
I wanted to watch
my little boy with a whore.

12:45.724 --> 12:48.125
Aw, seriously, Mexico?

12:51.012 --> 12:53.013
Hi!

12:53.081 --> 12:56.150
I'm Christopher, and this is
my adopted daughter Opal Louise.

12:56.217 --> 12:58.218
We are having <i>quite</i> a day.

12:58.286 --> 13:00.587
My Prius's nickel battery
is acting up,

13:00.655 --> 13:02.222
my iPhone's as dead
as Farrah Fawcett,

13:02.290 --> 13:03.824
and my life partner Michael

13:03.892 --> 13:05.626
is at a Grey Goose
event in Reykjavik.

13:05.694 --> 13:06.894
Can I use your phone?

13:06.961 --> 13:10.764
Get... in... my
house... now.

13:15.036 --> 13:17.037
Can you take my baby
into the other room?

13:17.105 --> 13:19.506
I prefer her not to
see me use landlines.

13:19.574 --> 13:21.392
I get it.

13:25.380 --> 13:26.847
Wait a minute.

13:26.915 --> 13:29.450
There's no Grey Goose event
in Reykjavik this week...

13:29.517 --> 13:30.918
Who are you?

13:30.985 --> 13:32.386
<i>Ouah!</i>
Roger!

13:34.222 --> 13:35.689
What about your baby?

13:35.757 --> 13:36.757
Keep it!

13:39.210 --> 13:42.663
Hey... you can't drive
with no wheels.

13:42.731 --> 13:43.764
Thank you, genius!

13:43.832 --> 13:45.899
My cousin sells tires.

13:45.967 --> 13:47.634
You want me take you there?

13:47.702 --> 13:49.036
Really?

13:49.104 --> 13:51.205
Wow, I was just about to
give up on this country.

13:51.272 --> 13:52.473
Thank you, Mexican.

13:55.226 --> 13:59.396
Friends, burritos, you are the
first good thing to happen to us

13:59.464 --> 14:00.814
in this godforsaken country.

14:00.899 --> 14:03.600
You know, most of
our country is wonderful.

14:03.651 --> 14:04.685
Oh, by the way?

14:04.769 --> 14:06.854
You're being kidnapped
right now.

14:06.938 --> 14:08.906
<i>Oh, come on, Mexico!</i>

14:08.973 --> 14:10.441
<i>Dad, I don't feel so good.</i>

14:12.577 --> 14:13.677
<i>Horchata!</i>

14:18.782 --> 14:20.332
What do you want from us?

14:20.400 --> 14:23.085
Firstly? For you not to yell.
I am right here.

14:23.153 --> 14:24.520
We're a drug cartel,

14:24.588 --> 14:26.388
so it's just good to have
white people around.

14:26.456 --> 14:29.058
Maybe we sell you,
maybe we make sex with you...

14:29.126 --> 14:31.360
Well, son, this is where we die.

14:31.428 --> 14:32.795
We had a good run.

14:32.879 --> 14:35.564
Mine better than yours,
but it's not a competition.

14:35.632 --> 14:36.966
I win.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.617
Dad, you'll think of
something else, right?

14:38.685 --> 14:40.853
Nope, Daddy's shuttin' down.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.777
Pop, you need to eat.

14:47.844 --> 14:49.345
You're wasting away.

14:49.412 --> 14:51.547
You're doing
a reverse Vince Vaughn.

14:51.615 --> 14:54.950
Sorry, kiddo,
it's time to face reality.

14:55.018 --> 14:56.418
We're gonna die.

15:01.374 --> 15:03.409
Well, if you won't eat for me,

15:03.477 --> 15:05.861
maybe you'll do it for...

15:05.929 --> 15:06.929
Pedro!

15:08.632 --> 15:10.332
That's right, man!

15:10.417 --> 15:13.285
You need to eat,
so you can get strong

15:13.336 --> 15:15.254
and come on
a wonderful adventure!

15:15.321 --> 15:17.273
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

15:17.340 --> 15:19.892
I... I don't
want to play, Steve.

15:19.960 --> 15:20.993
Mmm.

15:21.044 --> 15:22.878
This food can be
anything you want

15:22.963 --> 15:24.563
if you use your imagination.

15:24.631 --> 15:26.632
I'm eating taquitos!

15:26.700 --> 15:29.051
My favorite, except
they make me toot.

15:30.303 --> 15:31.804
Whoops, there I go.

15:32.873 --> 15:34.240
Can you smell it?

15:34.307 --> 15:35.407
Is it stinky?

15:36.510 --> 15:37.676
Stop farting, Pedro!

15:37.744 --> 15:38.911
It's so stinky!

15:40.013 --> 15:41.080
I smell it!

15:41.148 --> 15:43.015
I can smell your farts, Pedro!

15:45.502 --> 15:48.304
And Pedro, you're so...

15:48.371 --> 15:49.939
handsome.

15:50.006 --> 15:52.308
Welcome to the world
of imagination.

15:52.375 --> 15:55.277
In here, you can
imagine whatever you want.

15:55.345 --> 15:56.278
Anything?

15:56.346 --> 15:58.180
Anything.

16:01.968 --> 16:03.018
You're quite good.

16:03.086 --> 16:04.820
I know.

16:07.557 --> 16:09.859
Okay, the steaks
are almost ready.

16:09.926 --> 16:10.893
Where's the wine?

16:10.961 --> 16:12.361
Just moments away, sweetheart.

16:12.429 --> 16:15.164
My Rube Goldberg device
will deliver the Rain Duck

16:15.232 --> 16:16.232
right into our hands.

16:20.570 --> 16:23.372
When I was a little
girl, Grover Cleveland was President.

17:20.096 --> 17:22.397
Now we wait until they
notice our power is out

17:22.464 --> 17:24.300
and come over to check on us.

17:27.237 --> 17:28.337
Ah, screw it.

17:28.405 --> 17:30.339
I'm done waiting for this wine.

17:30.407 --> 17:32.408
Damn Rube Goldberg,
family of flies...

17:32.475 --> 17:34.209
600 bucks on dominos...

17:34.277 --> 17:35.778
Hey, Francine.

17:37.447 --> 17:38.847
Oh God! My face!

17:38.915 --> 17:41.784
Oh...

17:41.851 --> 17:43.519
Your face.
<i>Your</i> face!

17:43.586 --> 17:45.371
Our faces...

17:48.808 --> 17:50.209
You got it!

17:50.277 --> 17:52.645
That's how you get
a bottle of Rain Duck!

17:53.513 --> 17:55.614
String on a corkscrew...

17:55.682 --> 17:57.516
Obviously that's nothing.

18:02.305 --> 18:04.106
You wanted both steaks.

18:04.174 --> 18:06.408
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.

18:06.476 --> 18:07.876
Is Francine dead?

18:07.944 --> 18:09.011
I don't know.

18:10.313 --> 18:12.448
You know who else
was a cockroach?

18:12.515 --> 18:14.316
Theo Huxtable's best friend.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.118
Oh, that's right, that's right.

18:18.271 --> 18:19.388
Hey, Dad! Look!

18:19.456 --> 18:20.556
It's a food drop!

18:23.093 --> 18:25.394
It's coming in for a landing!

18:30.233 --> 18:31.700
Nom, nom, nom.

18:33.486 --> 18:34.436
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

18:35.889 --> 18:37.539
Wow.

18:37.607 --> 18:39.675
When was the last time
you had that much fun?

18:39.743 --> 18:41.110
Years.

18:41.177 --> 18:43.696
Oh. So you didn't have fun
at my birthday party last week?

18:43.763 --> 18:47.066
Dude, there was a huge fire;
all those people died.

18:47.133 --> 18:49.168
Oh, God, yeah.

18:49.235 --> 18:51.236
Wow, those guys look so bummed.

18:51.304 --> 18:53.105
That gives me an idea.

18:53.173 --> 18:54.573
Hey, amigos.

18:54.641 --> 18:56.508
Wanna play?

19:00.213 --> 19:01.830
Hey, look!

19:01.898 --> 19:04.466
Two handsome Latino astronauts!

19:04.534 --> 19:06.735
Yes! We are back
from space!

19:06.803 --> 19:08.337
We went to Jupiter...

19:08.405 --> 19:10.572
We went to...

19:10.640 --> 19:12.641
one of those other planets.

19:12.709 --> 19:15.778
Hey, while you were gone,
the space puppies were born.

19:15.845 --> 19:17.830
Oh my God,
I knew that would happen!

19:17.897 --> 19:18.897
Can we see them?

19:18.965 --> 19:20.532
Can you see them?

19:20.600 --> 19:21.600
You're their uncles.

19:21.668 --> 19:23.285
I hope you'll see them.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.471
I hope you'll have a great
relationship with them.

19:31.478 --> 19:32.678
So cute! Oh, so cute!

19:32.746 --> 19:34.913
I know!
I'm freaking out about it!

19:34.981 --> 19:36.298
You guys want to pet them?

19:36.383 --> 19:37.916
Yes, yes, <i>si.</i>

19:37.984 --> 19:38.917
Yes, yes!

19:38.968 --> 19:40.869
All right, I'll let you in,

19:40.937 --> 19:43.155
but you gotta keep the door
closed so they don't escape.

19:43.223 --> 19:46.558
We'll be right out here,
taking pictures and waving.

19:49.312 --> 19:51.596
Come on, Dad! Let's go!

19:53.616 --> 19:54.566
Oh...

19:54.617 --> 19:56.952
Deceived once again by whimsy.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.491
I am impressed, son.

20:02.575 --> 20:04.293
How did you trick
those guards like that?

20:04.377 --> 20:06.611
I could see they were desperate
to escape their reality,

20:06.663 --> 20:08.580
so I just provided
an opportunity.

20:08.631 --> 20:10.449
I do it all the time at home.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.251
Geez, is your life
really that bad?

20:12.302 --> 20:13.752
Sometimes.

20:13.803 --> 20:15.637
More often than I'd like.

20:15.722 --> 20:18.140
It'd be really nice
to talk to somebody about it.

20:23.963 --> 20:25.630
Anyway...

20:25.682 --> 20:27.649
Well, I gotta hand it to you.

20:27.734 --> 20:30.969
I would've starved to death if
you hadn't shown me how to play.

20:31.020 --> 20:32.404
You keep your toys.

20:32.472 --> 20:33.972
Thanks, Dad.

20:34.023 --> 20:36.608
And thank you, Pedro.

20:36.659 --> 20:37.876
See you around.

20:40.913 --> 20:42.163
"See you around"?!

20:42.231 --> 20:43.548
Are you kidding me?

20:43.616 --> 20:45.500
I saved your lives!

20:45.568 --> 20:46.518
Come back, you cowards!

20:46.585 --> 20:48.002
I'll kill you!

20:48.070 --> 20:50.438
I'll hunt you down
and kill you!

20:53.042 --> 20:55.160
Bye! Have a beautiful time.
