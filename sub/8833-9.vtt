<i>Leonardo.</i>

00:03.235 --> 00:05.703
It speaks with
my mother's voice!

00:07.539 --> 00:09.140
Don't take the book away
from my people.

00:09.208 --> 00:10.808
There was no book.

00:12.177 --> 00:14.612
<i>Duke Federico</i>
<i>surrounds Florence.</i>

00:14.680 --> 00:17.181
Perhaps it is
time to strike.

00:17.249 --> 00:19.083
<i>Lorenzo di Medici.</i>

00:19.151 --> 00:22.353
What a priceless opportunity
to discuss your surrender.

00:23.589 --> 00:24.889
She was your mother.

00:24.957 --> 00:26.924
This is where faith
has carried me.

00:28.227 --> 00:29.694
What personal business would
the son of the Sultan

00:29.761 --> 00:32.563
have with the prized mistress
of Lorenzo di Medici,

00:32.631 --> 00:33.531
Signora Donati?

00:33.599 --> 00:36.067
You came here
expecting peace?

00:36.134 --> 00:38.102
Rid my house
of this filth.

00:38.170 --> 00:39.737
We shall soon know
the truth

00:39.805 --> 00:41.138
without laying a hand
upon you.

00:41.206 --> 00:42.874
How could that device
be built without

00:42.941 --> 00:44.842
the knowledge
of the Book of Leaves?

00:44.910 --> 00:48.212
Leo, it's a miracle!
The quest is far from over.

<i>As I recall,</i>

02:04.222 --> 02:06.490
<i>the mechanism was only</i>
<i>minimally damaged.</i>

02:06.558 --> 02:08.158
Your talent for
compounding disaster

02:08.226 --> 02:11.729
is truly impressive.

02:11.797 --> 02:15.900
I have compounded nothing.

02:15.968 --> 02:17.435
In order to repair it,

02:17.502 --> 02:18.836
I had to take it apart
to examine its inner workings.

02:18.904 --> 02:22.406
Without access
to the correct tools...

02:28.013 --> 02:30.748
I will get it
functioning again.

02:30.816 --> 02:32.083
<i>Possibly.</i>

02:32.150 --> 02:34.552
But you would be wiser to
forsake this fatal quest

02:34.620 --> 02:36.854
and resume your
artistic endeavors.

02:36.922 --> 02:38.589
You sound like my maestro.

02:38.657 --> 02:40.157
Return to him,
Da Vinci.

02:40.225 --> 02:42.627
As I will return
to mine.

02:46.431 --> 02:47.498
You're going back to Rome?

02:47.566 --> 02:51.402
Without the Church, I...

02:51.470 --> 02:52.970
Well, I'm nothing.

02:54.172 --> 02:57.775
I will place myself entirely
at the Pope's mercy.

03:04.583 --> 03:08.586
You do realize...

03:08.654 --> 03:10.388
..Sixtus may show you none?

03:13.659 --> 03:17.561
Perhaps that's what I deserve
for worshiping false idols.

03:20.499 --> 03:22.299
<i>Land ho!</i>

03:49.828 --> 03:52.596
It's felt surprisingly
civilized to be your ally.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.669
Well, we may have survived
this journey together.

03:58.737 --> 04:00.137
But in a few moments,

04:00.205 --> 04:04.241
any alliance we may have had
will come to an end.

04:19.391 --> 04:20.757
<i>Where are you from?</i>

04:20.826 --> 04:21.926
Florence.

04:21.993 --> 04:24.595
<i>Who sent you here?</i>

04:24.663 --> 04:26.931
The Pope.

04:26.998 --> 04:28.933
What is your name?

04:29.000 --> 04:32.570
Lucrezia...Donati.

04:32.637 --> 04:33.471
<i>Where are you from?</i>

04:33.538 --> 04:34.872
Florence.

04:34.940 --> 04:36.774
Who sent you here?
The Pope.

04:36.842 --> 04:38.976
What is your name?
Lucrezia Donati.

04:39.044 --> 04:40.544
Where are you from?
Florence.

04:40.612 --> 04:41.879
Who sent you here?
The Pope.

04:41.947 --> 04:43.380
What is your name?
Lucrezia...

04:43.448 --> 04:45.049
<i>Where are you from?</i>
Florence.

04:45.117 --> 04:46.198
<i>Who sent you here?</i>
The Pope.

04:46.251 --> 04:47.585
<i>What is your name?</i>
Lucrezia...

04:47.652 --> 04:49.553
Where are you from?
Who sent you here?

04:49.621 --> 04:52.256
<i>What is your name?</i>

04:52.324 --> 04:53.724
What does it matter?

04:53.792 --> 04:57.094
Day after day, you've asked me
the same three questions,

04:57.162 --> 05:00.531
over and over again -
it's insanity.

05:00.599 --> 05:01.599
Where are you from?

05:04.770 --> 05:06.804
Florence.
Who sent you here?

05:06.872 --> 05:10.407
Pope Sixtus....
Bishop of Rome...

05:10.475 --> 05:13.711
Holy Father of
the Christian Church.

05:13.779 --> 05:16.680
His Holiness sends
an invitation to parley.

05:16.748 --> 05:19.884
As I've already
told you,

05:19.951 --> 05:23.420
my father
only seeks peace.

05:30.128 --> 05:31.996
Where are you sending him?
What's happening?

05:32.063 --> 05:33.330
Signora Donati?

05:33.398 --> 05:37.234
I gather you have finally
revealed your truth to us.

05:39.504 --> 05:42.606
You seem to think that this
slave woman is an oracle.

05:42.674 --> 05:44.942
But she has asked me
only the same questions

05:45.010 --> 05:48.779
and I have given her
only the same answers.

05:48.847 --> 05:50.581
That's where
you're wrong.

05:50.649 --> 05:54.618
With each answer, a prisoner
gives slight variations.

05:54.686 --> 05:59.123
A word changed here or there,
a hesitation at someone's name.

05:59.191 --> 06:02.726
What have you discovered?

06:02.794 --> 06:04.562
There are two popes.

06:04.629 --> 06:08.699
One remains hidden,
he is her father.

06:08.767 --> 06:11.702
He seeks no peace.

06:11.770 --> 06:15.906
He seeks war.

06:19.945 --> 06:24.048
Ah, Florence, you wretched hive
of shit and sin!

06:24.115 --> 06:26.584
I have fucking missed you!

06:29.454 --> 06:33.090
Is it after curfew?

06:33.158 --> 06:36.694
It shouldn't be.

06:36.761 --> 06:38.796
The lamps in Giotto's tower
are dark.

06:40.532 --> 06:44.702
Something's amiss.
Exactly! I'm not drunk yet.

06:44.769 --> 06:45.870
There you and I agree.

06:45.937 --> 06:48.939
Come on, painter,
our first round's on me.

06:49.007 --> 06:51.108
That'll be
the fucking day!

06:51.176 --> 06:53.143
When I've finished my maps...

06:53.211 --> 06:55.045
Listen! ..of the New World,

06:55.113 --> 06:57.615
my Pisan friend Cristoforo will
make me a rich man.

06:57.682 --> 07:01.385
You two go along without me.
There's someone I must see.

07:03.088 --> 07:04.154
Great.

07:32.484 --> 07:33.786
One way or another,

07:34.345 --> 07:36.655
I knew that fate
would bring you home.

07:38.890 --> 07:41.592
Maestro.

07:41.660 --> 07:43.527
It's so good to see you.

07:43.595 --> 07:45.863
And you, my boy.

07:45.931 --> 07:48.565
It's wonderful to know
that you're both still alive.

07:48.633 --> 07:51.502
I've something to show you.
Before you do, Leo...

07:51.569 --> 07:56.140
I know you've always believed my
quest is foolish fire, but...

07:56.207 --> 07:58.042
I need your help.

07:58.109 --> 08:00.044
Now, we found this
in the city made of stone.

08:00.111 --> 08:03.781
What in God's name...

08:03.848 --> 08:05.716
It's a Brazen Head.

08:05.784 --> 08:06.884
That's impossible.

08:06.952 --> 08:10.688
It's just a myth.
No, it's very real.

08:10.755 --> 08:14.358
This device, its machinations
are like nothing I've ever seen.

08:14.426 --> 08:17.361
We must hide it.

08:17.429 --> 08:18.462
Andrea, I need your help.

08:18.530 --> 08:21.265
Stop. There's
something you must know.

08:21.333 --> 08:22.499
<i>They came in here!</i>

08:24.302 --> 08:27.104
There they are.

08:27.172 --> 08:29.373
Oh, for fuck's sake.

08:29.441 --> 08:32.208
We've literally
just got back.

08:32.277 --> 08:34.378
So tell Captain Dragonetti

08:34.446 --> 08:36.714
he can save his harassment
until tomorrow.

08:36.780 --> 08:40.384
No need. Things have changed in
your absence, artista.

08:40.452 --> 08:43.620
I'm captain now.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.990
He hey.

08:48.059 --> 08:51.862
What's happened?
I was trying to tell you, my boy.

08:51.930 --> 08:53.797
This place is no longer home.

08:53.865 --> 08:55.933
<i>Bring these two</i>
<i>to the palace.</i>

09:44.783 --> 09:45.916
Signora?

09:45.984 --> 09:49.319
Who did this to you?
I did.

09:51.623 --> 09:53.524
Welcome home, artista.

09:53.591 --> 09:57.628
I wondered when Florence's famed
war engineer would turn up.

09:57.695 --> 09:59.530
Not quite the challenge
I expected.

09:59.597 --> 10:01.565
Why are you here?
For money.

10:01.633 --> 10:06.303
The Holy Father paid my forces
a tidy sum to take Florence.

10:06.371 --> 10:08.605
Where's Lorenzo?

10:08.673 --> 10:10.774
He's gone to undo Naples'
alliance with Rome.

10:10.842 --> 10:14.344
You still believe that tale?

10:14.412 --> 10:16.246
It's more likely he's taken
another mistress.

10:16.314 --> 10:19.850
And slithered off to the safety
of France or Spain.

10:19.918 --> 10:21.952
Lorenzo would never
abandon Florence.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.320
Yet here I am,

10:23.388 --> 10:27.458
sitting in his throne
among his many luxuries.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.594
His blade.

10:30.662 --> 10:33.664
It looks valuable.
I know this piece.

10:33.731 --> 10:35.566
It's a bit smaller
than I remember.

10:35.633 --> 10:39.269
Old Cosimo's sword he bequeathed
to his grandsons.

10:39.337 --> 10:41.371
How'd you get
your hands on it?

10:41.439 --> 10:44.508
I swore to follow
its instructions.

10:47.011 --> 10:49.246
"Freedom of the people"?

10:49.314 --> 10:51.397
Look what freedom you

10:51.422 --> 10:53.765
and Lorenzo have
achieved for your people.

10:54.319 --> 10:56.086
The fight's not over yet.

10:57.322 --> 10:59.690
Lorenzo will return.

10:59.757 --> 11:04.194
Of course he will.
Where else will we bury him?

11:11.669 --> 11:14.671
Your obstinacy
is becoming tedious.

11:14.739 --> 11:18.442
If you simply point
to where you relocated

11:18.510 --> 11:20.511
your bank's
golden stockpile,

11:20.578 --> 11:22.012
you and your family
will be allowed

11:22.080 --> 11:23.480
to live out the rest
of your days

11:23.548 --> 11:26.350
on a small plot of land.

11:26.417 --> 11:30.120
Well, it is safely hidden behind
the walls of Florence.

11:30.188 --> 11:31.622
That's a lie.

11:31.689 --> 11:32.956
We've searched every
corner of the city.

11:33.024 --> 11:36.860
Impossible.

11:36.928 --> 11:38.896
What if I told you
that Duke Federico

11:38.963 --> 11:41.598
sacked your
beloved Florence...

11:41.666 --> 11:44.134
..at my behest?

11:45.303 --> 11:47.104
Perhaps you
should ask someone

11:47.172 --> 11:49.006
with direct knowledge
of the situation.

11:51.109 --> 11:53.877
The soul survivor
of your own militia.

11:59.751 --> 12:01.213
You're Bianchi's boy,
are you not?

12:01.300 --> 12:02.781
His youngest son.

12:02.820 --> 12:04.721
I'm now his only son.

12:06.457 --> 12:07.591
You have served
your republic well.

12:07.659 --> 12:09.526
Aargh!

12:09.594 --> 12:11.795
I beg to differ.

12:16.534 --> 12:17.601
Here lies proof,
Lorenzo,

12:17.669 --> 12:20.237
that all Florence
is under our command.

12:20.305 --> 12:22.906
Its citizens,
your daughters...

12:22.974 --> 12:24.875
your wife.

12:24.943 --> 12:27.744
Perhaps under Federico,
she will finally bear a son.

12:31.950 --> 12:33.283
You kill me...

12:33.351 --> 12:35.319
and I swear,
the Medici wealth

12:35.386 --> 12:38.455
will forever remain
beyond your grasp.

12:38.523 --> 12:41.058
The men who guard it are
the only people, save myself,

12:41.125 --> 12:42.926
who know its location.

12:42.994 --> 12:47.130
They will die before you ever
lay a hand on a single florin.

12:47.198 --> 12:48.365
Usurer.

12:48.433 --> 12:51.768
You are no better than
heathens, Turks or Jews.

12:51.836 --> 12:56.840
But I will willingly give
all the Medici gold to you...

12:56.908 --> 13:00.277
Your Grace,

13:00.345 --> 13:01.445
if you can guarantee
the safety

13:01.512 --> 13:03.880
of my republic
and its citizens.

13:06.284 --> 13:07.751
What balls!

13:07.819 --> 13:10.387
Our forces control
all of Tuscany.

13:10.455 --> 13:13.824
Alfonso, serious discussions are
no place for children.

13:13.891 --> 13:17.227
We will find their gold
eventually.

13:17.295 --> 13:18.962
Remove yourself!

13:21.766 --> 13:26.937
I remind Your Majesty,
we are already allied.

13:27.005 --> 13:29.906
This is not a negotiation.

13:29.974 --> 13:34.878
He is offering to make me
the richest man in Italy.

13:34.946 --> 13:37.014
This just became
a negotiation.

13:53.398 --> 13:54.831
<i>Nico?</i>

13:54.899 --> 13:56.133
<i>Nico!</i>

13:56.200 --> 13:57.401
Vanessa!

13:57.468 --> 13:58.635
Leo!

13:58.703 --> 14:00.304
There you are!

14:02.407 --> 14:04.875
I knew you wouldn't stay gone.

14:04.942 --> 14:07.177
Oh, look at you.
Look at you.

14:07.245 --> 14:10.447
The physic said
I'm due any day now.

14:10.515 --> 14:11.915
Those monsters
keeping you in here?

14:11.983 --> 14:13.644
Do they know you carry
Giuliano's child?

14:13.669 --> 14:15.152
They don't care.

14:15.153 --> 14:17.587
Oh!
Hey, hey!

14:19.657 --> 14:20.657
Move!

14:23.594 --> 14:26.163
You need medical attention?
<i>Da Vinci!</i>

14:32.437 --> 14:34.371
Yes.

14:39.644 --> 14:41.445
You should be honored.
Why?

14:41.512 --> 14:43.780
The Duke has sent
his personal torturers

14:43.848 --> 14:45.582
to have
a word with you.

14:52.824 --> 14:54.558
Look at you,
making yourself at home.

14:54.625 --> 14:58.228
My husband has been pacing
the halls for hours.

14:58.296 --> 15:00.564
But you seem vigorous
as ever.

15:00.631 --> 15:02.192
Well, you know I have
a robust appetite.

15:02.233 --> 15:03.367
Indeed.

15:03.434 --> 15:08.638
I must say, I'm very happy
to see you clean shaven.

15:08.706 --> 15:10.173
As you remember.

15:10.241 --> 15:11.908
Mm.

15:55.753 --> 16:00.390
For weeks, I have
imagined this moment.

16:00.458 --> 16:04.895
I rejoice that
it has finally arrived.

16:04.962 --> 16:07.731
Why are you here,
Girolamo?

16:07.799 --> 16:12.102
Because you're the true hand
of God on earth.

16:12.170 --> 16:14.838
Because I was
a fool to believe

16:14.906 --> 16:16.173
I could gain
the Lord's grace

16:16.240 --> 16:18.542
by following my father.

16:22.513 --> 16:25.649
I throw myself entirely
at your mercy.

16:25.716 --> 16:27.451
I beg you for
your forgiveness.

16:31.856 --> 16:33.990
Rise.

16:43.968 --> 16:47.237
My own father would have taken
the lash to me or worse.

16:50.141 --> 16:52.876
You'll never know how your
absolution soothes my soul.

16:54.412 --> 16:57.681
There is no absolution.

16:57.748 --> 17:00.083
Not from me.

17:02.887 --> 17:07.991
You stood by as your father
murdered my child.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.728
You commanded
Lucrezia to whore herself

17:11.796 --> 17:13.430
in the name
of a false pope!

17:14.799 --> 17:18.568
I will do whatever
you require to restore you

17:18.636 --> 17:21.938
to your rightful place...

17:22.006 --> 17:23.339
..to expose my father,

17:23.406 --> 17:25.342
to put an end to
all the suffering

17:25.409 --> 17:27.644
we've brought upon
the world in God's name.

17:27.712 --> 17:32.182
This will not be an end
of suffering, Girolamo.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.985
Not for you.

17:35.052 --> 17:38.555
Your suffering will not end
until the day you die!

17:40.558 --> 17:43.059
If what you seek
is forgiveness,

17:43.127 --> 17:45.095
then I suggest you look
elsewhere.

17:47.231 --> 17:49.132
I cannot serve my father.

18:08.486 --> 18:10.654
If you will not take me...

18:13.791 --> 18:16.192
..I have nothing.

18:18.462 --> 18:20.897
"Nothing"
is what you deserve.

19:35.006 --> 19:37.440
You're the sodomite?

19:37.508 --> 19:39.776
You might actually
enjoy this.

20:03.401 --> 20:05.368
Da Vinci?

20:05.436 --> 20:06.970
Yes?

20:07.038 --> 20:09.305
I always wanted to meet you.

20:09.373 --> 20:12.709
Though perhaps under different
circumstances.

20:12.777 --> 20:15.178
Carlo di Medici,
Cosimo's son.

20:15.246 --> 20:18.381
Yes.
A bastard, like yourself, I believe.

20:18.449 --> 20:21.217
So I've been told.

20:21.285 --> 20:25.021
I returned to aid
my family...

20:25.089 --> 20:27.824
rather unsuccessfully.

20:27.892 --> 20:29.826
Well, is there no one left
who can fight for Florence?

20:29.894 --> 20:33.496
There may be some,
hidden in the shadows.

20:33.564 --> 20:37.367
But those who can fight
have been jailed.

20:37.435 --> 20:38.768
Or worse.

20:46.844 --> 20:49.646
I'm feeling hoggish.

20:49.714 --> 20:51.915
Get us one more.

20:51.982 --> 20:54.317
The Duke knows his business.

20:54.385 --> 20:57.821
It's not every day we see
torturers with these credentials.

20:57.888 --> 20:59.723
This way.

21:01.625 --> 21:02.859
Move.

21:02.927 --> 21:07.063
It would be an honor
if you let me watch.

21:07.131 --> 21:11.401
The painter and I
have some history.

21:11.469 --> 21:13.636
I'd love it if you'd allow me
to deliver the opening blow.

21:13.704 --> 21:17.273
Torture is a learned art.

21:17.341 --> 21:21.344
But we may allow you,
if you are willing to...

21:21.412 --> 21:24.614
..fondle our balls.

21:24.682 --> 21:25.882
Urgh!

21:31.188 --> 21:32.689
How the...
It's a gift.

21:32.757 --> 21:37.060
Oh, we must release him
as well.

21:37.128 --> 21:38.228
He's a Medici.

21:41.665 --> 21:43.700
Right, now, put this on.

21:43.768 --> 21:45.735
What about the others?
No time.

21:45.803 --> 21:47.971
They'll figure us out
unless we leave now.

21:48.038 --> 21:50.406
You're more use to them outside
of these walls Da Vinci.

21:50.474 --> 21:52.008
Put this on.

21:52.076 --> 21:54.778
The loyalists are holed up
at the Barking Dog.

22:15.866 --> 22:19.068
Those fucking dogs are out for
blood tonight.

22:19.136 --> 22:20.136
They're looking for us,
Leo.

22:20.204 --> 22:21.504
We've got to get out
of Florence,

22:21.572 --> 22:23.506
They'll turn this city upside
down till they find us.

22:23.574 --> 22:24.874
We're not leaving Florence.

22:24.942 --> 22:26.676
We have to take
the city back.

22:26.744 --> 22:28.812
You're out of your mind.
He's right.

22:28.879 --> 22:30.847
Captain Dragonetti.

22:30.915 --> 22:33.216
Not since they stripped me
of my title.

22:33.284 --> 22:35.451
The Officers
of the Night.

22:35.519 --> 22:36.986
Some of those are still
your own men.

22:37.054 --> 22:40.056
Traitors.

22:40.124 --> 22:42.859
How is she?
Da Vinci confirms Clarice is still alive.

22:42.927 --> 22:44.460
I failed her
and the whole city.

22:44.528 --> 22:46.763
There must be a way
of winning the city back.

22:46.831 --> 22:48.164
Duke Federico.

22:48.232 --> 22:52.869
His men work for money.
Take him out, they'll disperse.

22:52.937 --> 22:54.237
The Duke's no fool.

22:54.305 --> 22:55.905
He's covered
all points of entry.

22:55.973 --> 22:57.974
The palace can't
be impenetrable.

22:58.042 --> 23:00.577
I may have a way.

23:00.644 --> 23:02.178
One Urbino may not think
to guard.

23:02.246 --> 23:04.380
There's a grated opening
that provides ventilation

23:04.448 --> 23:05.615
for the blacksmith's forge.

23:05.683 --> 23:07.717
And you'd enter the furnace?

23:07.785 --> 23:10.320
It leads up the chimney
to the roof.

23:10.387 --> 23:12.956
What if the forge is lit? You'd
be broiled alive.

23:13.023 --> 23:15.058
I've examined the entire palace
structure for weaknesses,

23:15.125 --> 23:16.526
there are none.

23:16.594 --> 23:19.195
And yet three assassins entered
through windows just weeks ago.

23:19.263 --> 23:21.898
Windows?
The clerestory windows.

23:21.966 --> 23:23.933
The ones in the roof.

23:24.001 --> 23:28.705
They open up to the bedrooms,
the gallery and the great hall.

23:28.772 --> 23:32.308
That may work.

23:32.376 --> 23:34.544
You'll never reach them
without being spotted.

23:38.282 --> 23:40.183
I need these items:

23:40.251 --> 23:42.652
Zo, eight planks of wood,
as pliable as possible.

23:42.720 --> 23:45.321
I'm not wandering the streets.
They're searching for us.

23:45.389 --> 23:47.357
I need a ten pound
iron weight,

23:47.424 --> 23:48.725
the bladder
of a freshly-killed cow,

23:48.792 --> 23:50.593
and some spongia soporifica.

23:50.661 --> 23:51.628
You'd poison their food?

23:51.695 --> 23:52.896
They're trained mercenaries.

23:52.963 --> 23:54.864
They avoid traps like
this by eating in shifts.

23:54.932 --> 23:56.633
They don't breathe in shifts.

23:56.700 --> 23:57.406
Fumes?

23:57.431 --> 23:59.995
Exactly. Hit them from above
and knock them out.

24:00.271 --> 24:02.705
Sorry. Sorry,
with all due respect,

24:02.773 --> 24:04.507
how are we gonna
infiltrate a palace

24:04.575 --> 24:08.444
guarded by the most
brutal soldiers in Italy?

24:08.512 --> 24:09.612
Creatively.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.322
Relieve your thirst.

24:19.390 --> 24:21.324
Now you offer me help.

24:23.794 --> 24:25.061
No, wait.

24:36.674 --> 24:38.007
I did help you.

24:38.075 --> 24:41.711
You wanted them to know about
your father, did you not?

24:50.220 --> 24:54.157
Your only mission was
to get the son of the Sultan to Rome.

24:54.224 --> 24:58.428
Once that was accomplished, the
outcome was all but assured.

24:59.763 --> 25:01.864
If Bayezid is killed,
the result is war.

25:01.932 --> 25:03.800
If he is imprisoned,
war again.

25:03.867 --> 25:06.002
If he is dishonored
and dismissed...

25:06.070 --> 25:09.672
...retaliation
will be required.

25:09.740 --> 25:13.743
The only outcome that would
undo your father's plan,

25:13.811 --> 25:18.982
is if the pretender
were to consider peace.

25:19.049 --> 25:21.484
Which is an impossibility.

25:21.552 --> 25:25.855
When my father regains
his position,

25:25.923 --> 25:28.491
and all of Italy
are united behind him,

25:28.559 --> 25:31.327
he will restore peace.

25:31.395 --> 25:34.063
Yes.

25:34.131 --> 25:36.766
He will.

25:36.834 --> 25:38.568
The dead are
always peaceful.

25:53.617 --> 25:56.519
I trust you are
as happy to see me

25:56.587 --> 25:58.821
as I am to see you.

26:08.899 --> 26:09.939
I suppose even King Arthur

26:09.967 --> 26:11.367
won a battle or two
with witchcraft.

26:11.435 --> 26:13.703
Arthur had a magician
at his disposal.

26:13.771 --> 26:16.205
And you are?

26:16.273 --> 26:19.675
I'm just a man.

26:19.743 --> 26:23.579
With varied interests,
like your father, Cosimo.

26:23.647 --> 26:26.916
Duke Federico has more men
outside the city gates.

26:26.984 --> 26:28.317
If we fail to deliver
your concoction,

26:28.385 --> 26:29.419
they'll execute us all.

26:29.486 --> 26:30.887
We won't fail.

26:30.954 --> 26:31.988
The trajectories
of flying objects

26:32.056 --> 26:36.659
is something I've
become versed in of late.

26:36.727 --> 26:39.162
This...

26:39.229 --> 26:41.998
This armature employs a
semi-elliptical lead spring.

26:42.066 --> 26:44.300
It improves upon any catapult
those mercenaries

26:44.368 --> 26:45.701
will have encountered.

26:49.073 --> 26:52.008
You are like my father.

26:52.076 --> 26:54.944
I'd wager you're just
as interested in the Book of Leaves.

26:56.313 --> 26:57.613
I've heard of it.

26:59.316 --> 27:01.084
We've got a problem!

27:01.151 --> 27:03.152
Dragonetti,
Vespucci and your friend,

27:03.220 --> 27:05.154
the Duke's soldiers
just caught them

27:05.222 --> 27:07.356
taking wood
for your catapult.

27:09.626 --> 27:11.661
We have to help them.
Da Vinci, wait!

27:11.728 --> 27:13.663
You'll fail.

27:15.999 --> 27:20.169
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

27:22.506 --> 27:24.140
The palace can be breached.

27:24.208 --> 27:26.209
That furnace.
Yes.

27:26.276 --> 27:28.596
The grate providing ventilation
for the blacksmith's forge.

27:28.645 --> 27:29.857
Dragonetti said that
was too dangerous.

27:29.882 --> 27:30.813
He did.

27:30.814 --> 27:33.449
But he's no bastard.

27:41.325 --> 27:44.060
This way. This way.

27:45.329 --> 27:48.131
It's warm.
We only have a few moments

27:48.198 --> 27:49.838
before it's hot enough
to cook us through.

27:57.141 --> 27:59.008
After you.

28:13.123 --> 28:15.091
You, girl.

28:15.159 --> 28:17.093
Come with me.

28:19.163 --> 28:22.665
You!
She's pregnant, you pig.

28:22.733 --> 28:24.867
Her mouth isn't pregnant.

28:32.709 --> 28:36.279
I may not win
this fight.

28:36.346 --> 28:38.381
But you may not leave this cell
with all of your parts.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.388
Get up, you little shit.

29:00.871 --> 29:05.074
I bet you're not even
the one who stuck it in her.

29:05.142 --> 29:06.776
Shit!

29:08.879 --> 29:11.514
Nico, are you okay?
It's alright.

29:35.372 --> 29:36.439
Aargh!

29:54.157 --> 29:56.192
Thank you.

29:56.260 --> 29:59.895
Are you ready?
Okay.

29:59.963 --> 30:01.697
Let's go.

30:13.443 --> 30:14.710
Oh.

30:14.778 --> 30:17.513
Thank you.
Are you alright?

30:17.581 --> 30:22.285
I will be when this is over.

30:22.352 --> 30:24.186
Get to the great hall.

30:39.836 --> 30:41.337
<i>More wine!</i>

30:49.513 --> 30:51.280
Oh, yeah! Ohh!

30:58.121 --> 31:01.724
Sure you don't want
a taste?

31:01.792 --> 31:04.327
Soon enough, you'll give
yourself to me willingly.

31:04.394 --> 31:07.830
It's the only way
I'll have you.

31:07.898 --> 31:11.200
Signore, the Florentine rebels
that we caught.

31:11.268 --> 31:15.037
That one's caused me lots
of grief since we arrived.

31:25.382 --> 31:28.084
Yes, I've taken shits more
impressive than these two.

31:28.151 --> 31:31.053
What do you think? Shall we have
some entertainment?

31:33.724 --> 31:36.092
More wine!

31:41.565 --> 31:46.335
More wine, come on.

31:46.403 --> 31:48.738
Ruff! Ruff!

32:29.146 --> 32:32.782
<i>Clarice?</i>

32:35.218 --> 32:37.486
Carlo? You took long enough.

32:37.554 --> 32:41.390
It's okay.

32:41.458 --> 32:44.393
It's okay.

32:54.538 --> 32:58.274
We only need one
of them to dangle

32:58.341 --> 33:01.811
in front of the city
as an example.

33:01.878 --> 33:04.847
Let's leave it up to them to choose.
Yeah!

33:04.915 --> 33:08.284
100 on the skinny one!

33:11.555 --> 33:12.655
They expect us
to fight?

33:12.722 --> 33:15.191
To the death,
for their amusement.

33:15.258 --> 33:16.725
Well, they're
fucking mad!

33:16.793 --> 33:18.093
Especially if they
bet on you.

33:18.161 --> 33:21.063
You'll be dead
before second course.

33:21.131 --> 33:22.765
You would kill me?

33:54.397 --> 33:57.766
Go on!

33:57.834 --> 33:58.934
Who's the cum-chucker now?

34:11.248 --> 34:15.150
Wait, look!

34:15.217 --> 34:16.299
What in God's name is that?

34:19.589 --> 34:20.922
Leo.

34:23.659 --> 34:25.860
Wait!

34:25.929 --> 34:28.464
Bastard!

35:21.217 --> 35:23.919
You're a sly little
swordsman for a painter.

35:52.248 --> 35:55.584
That the best you can do?

36:27.150 --> 36:28.283
Oh, nearly.

36:41.364 --> 36:42.531
Why do I keep fucking
missing you?

36:42.599 --> 36:44.800
One eye, maybe?

36:44.868 --> 36:46.168
Well, you said it yourself,

36:46.236 --> 36:48.671
I'm a sly little
swordsman for a painter.

36:48.738 --> 36:51.473
And you've got one weakness that I've
been forced to exploit.

36:56.079 --> 36:57.446
You lack perspective.

36:58.515 --> 37:02.051
Da Vinci, stay your hand!

37:02.118 --> 37:03.318
Tell him, woman.

37:03.386 --> 37:04.787
I'm the Duke of Urbino.

37:04.854 --> 37:06.155
There'll be a tribunal.

37:06.222 --> 37:09.692
My fate won't be decided
by some Florentine bastard.

37:09.759 --> 37:12.494
I'll be judged by my
fellow heads of state.

37:12.562 --> 37:15.964
That you will.

37:20.303 --> 37:21.804
Guilty.

37:53.536 --> 37:57.339
Why are you doing this?

37:57.407 --> 38:02.211
To prepare you,
for what comes next.

38:32.375 --> 38:35.711
I will embrace your mercy
that you granted.

38:37.313 --> 38:40.415
Or if you so desire,

38:40.483 --> 38:42.217
I will embrace my penance.

40:20.250 --> 40:22.618
Duke Federico's men
have abandoned the city.

40:25.788 --> 40:29.825
I thank you, Leonardo.

40:29.893 --> 40:33.495
Anyone would have done
the same in my position.

40:33.563 --> 40:35.664
Where does this
humility come from?

40:35.732 --> 40:37.199
It doesn't suit you.

40:37.267 --> 40:42.704
I've had an enlightening
few months, Signora.

40:42.772 --> 40:45.540
As have I.

40:45.608 --> 40:49.044
I believe this is yours.

40:49.112 --> 40:51.847
I may carry it but it
belongs to your husband.

41:04.961 --> 41:07.496
There's a reason Lorenzo
wanted you to have it.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.635
<i>Leo, my boy!</i>

41:13.703 --> 41:15.337
Oh. I'm sorry, Signora.

41:15.405 --> 41:18.874
I won't keep him long
but he must come with me at once.

41:18.942 --> 41:21.076
I have something
to show you.

41:35.191 --> 41:37.292
Your Grace.

41:37.360 --> 41:39.361
In our conversation
last night, we...

41:39.429 --> 41:42.331
we found that we both

41:42.398 --> 41:46.101
have something of value
to offer each other.

41:48.771 --> 41:53.008
Please accept my offer
to share my good fortune

41:53.076 --> 41:54.710
with Naples

41:54.777 --> 41:59.314
and our successes
will know no bounds.

42:02.652 --> 42:04.486
Your Grace, will you...?

42:06.889 --> 42:09.691
It seems as if my father's
desire to negotiate

42:09.759 --> 42:12.961
has cooled.

42:15.264 --> 42:20.369
My father valued power
above all else.

42:20.436 --> 42:24.339
He taught me well.

42:24.374 --> 42:28.443
His cruelty prepared me
for this moment.

42:31.681 --> 42:35.617
He was going to accept
your offer.

42:35.685 --> 42:38.820
But in the end

42:38.888 --> 42:43.825
I could not allow
that to happen.

42:43.893 --> 42:46.128
Join me, my queen.

43:01.477 --> 43:04.146
Would you be so kind as
to tell your old friend

43:04.213 --> 43:06.448
the King's verdict?

43:09.452 --> 43:14.389
King Alfonso pledges to
act as the sword of Rome

43:14.457 --> 43:17.559
rejecting your offer
of alliance.

43:17.627 --> 43:21.797
I look forward to our
deepening communion, Your Highness.

43:21.864 --> 43:24.332
Now, Lorenzo,

43:24.400 --> 43:27.769
shall we discuss
the pending matter of your gold?

43:33.209 --> 43:34.910
Well, this is all
foreign to me.

43:39.982 --> 43:41.550
For the first time,
my boy,

43:41.617 --> 43:46.455
I think there may be something
to this Book of Leaves of yours.

43:46.522 --> 43:48.090
Oh.

43:48.157 --> 43:50.058
Well, what happened
to foolish fire?

43:50.126 --> 43:55.397
Well, perhaps
the only fool is me.

43:55.465 --> 43:59.568
Well, this device runs
using gold helical springs.

43:59.635 --> 44:01.269
Right.
As luck would have it,

44:01.337 --> 44:03.138
my experience
as a goldsmith

44:03.206 --> 44:06.308
has allowed me
to repair this wonder.

44:06.375 --> 44:10.512
I took a closer look at the
circular discs inside the mechanism.

44:10.580 --> 44:11.980
Yes.
And you can see

44:12.048 --> 44:16.685
these curious grooves
and ridges etched into them

44:16.752 --> 44:18.286
like a sculpture.

44:18.354 --> 44:21.957
I realized that they must
have been chiseled in.

44:22.024 --> 44:24.493
With amazing precision.
Yes.

44:24.560 --> 44:28.430
And this needle-like piece when placed
upon the corresponding grooves

44:28.498 --> 44:30.732
moved along
at a steady pace.

44:33.769 --> 44:38.240
The resulting combination
created sound.

44:38.307 --> 44:42.177
My mother's message.
Yes. In its entirety.

44:57.226 --> 44:58.860
<i>Leonardo, my dearest.</i>

44:58.928 --> 44:59.885
<i>I was betrayed.</i>

44:59.910 --> 45:02.931
<i>I could not keep</i>
<i>the Book of Leaves here.</i>

45:02.932 --> 45:05.567
<i>The only way you</i>
<i>will find its location</i>

45:05.635 --> 45:07.903
<i>is if you give</i>
<i>up your quest for me.</i>

45:07.970 --> 45:10.572
<i>You must beware</i>
<i>of The Labyrinth.</i>

45:10.640 --> 45:13.441
<i>Beware the enemies of man.</i>

45:13.509 --> 45:16.011
<i>They are everywhere.</i>

45:21.884 --> 45:25.487
So is that...
Is that...that's all?

45:28.257 --> 45:31.126
I expected more.
There is.

45:31.194 --> 45:33.562
If you're
truly listening.

45:39.535 --> 45:41.469
<i>- Leonardo, my dearest.</i>
<i>- #</i>

45:41.537 --> 45:43.738
<i>- I was betrayed.</i>
<i>- #</i>

45:43.806 --> 45:46.374
<i>- I could not keep the Book of Leaves here.</i>
<i>- #</i>

45:46.442 --> 45:48.310
<i>The only way you will...</i>
There are other hidden ridges.

45:48.377 --> 45:50.745
Other channels.

45:50.813 --> 45:52.814
Those musical tones
in the background.

45:52.882 --> 45:55.650
You've been trying to decode
a message in your mother's voice

45:55.718 --> 45:59.788
but beyond the voice...

45:59.855 --> 46:03.391
#
Leonardo my dearest...

46:03.459 --> 46:06.261
There's a code in the music.

46:06.329 --> 46:08.830
The words are
smoke and mirrors, Leo.

46:08.898 --> 46:12.367
Like everything we do.
Yes.

46:12.435 --> 46:13.802
Paints on canvas.

46:13.869 --> 46:17.138
But in the end, what are we but
masters of illusion?

46:17.206 --> 46:19.708
And my mother is...
One of us.  She's one of us.

46:19.775 --> 46:24.079
What separates us from the
garment maker and the stone mason?

46:24.146 --> 46:25.380
Ideas.

46:25.448 --> 46:27.882
<i>Vibrant colors,</i>
<i>yes, but beneath them,</i>

46:27.950 --> 46:30.485
<i>out of sight</i>
<i>from the untrained eye,</i>

46:31.520 --> 46:33.054
meaning.

46:59.982 --> 47:03.485
Girolamo Riario.

47:03.552 --> 47:07.155
You were dead.

47:07.223 --> 47:11.026
Now you're born again.

47:11.093 --> 47:13.094
Who are you?

47:14.497 --> 47:19.167
We are
the enemies of man.

47:32.181 --> 47:34.102
Heard of the Spanish
theorist Ramos de Pareja?

47:34.127 --> 47:34.883
No.

47:34.884 --> 47:37.786
He translated musical
notation into a 21-letter system

47:37.853 --> 47:39.688
as a way of
spelling words with notes.

47:39.755 --> 47:42.490
Do you know,
all these years,

47:42.558 --> 47:43.958
I never knew
you could read music.

47:44.026 --> 47:45.827
I learnt to play
the lute when I was eight.

47:45.895 --> 47:46.828
There was a girl involved.

47:46.904 --> 47:47.530
Naturally.

47:47.555 --> 47:49.154
And a boy.
Of course.

47:49.198 --> 47:50.999
You never took
the simple path.

47:58.374 --> 47:59.874
Look, look, look,
What, what, what?

47:59.942 --> 48:02.344
These notes correspond
to the same three words in Latin

48:02.411 --> 48:03.845
repeated again and again.

48:03.913 --> 48:07.849
Liber. Domus. Parvulus.

48:07.917 --> 48:11.519
Book. Home.
And child.

48:11.587 --> 48:13.855
But what does it mean?

48:16.459 --> 48:17.859
It means
my mother's alive.

48:19.729 --> 48:21.096
She left the vault
with the Book of Leaves

48:21.163 --> 48:23.598
and took it somewhere
she knew I would find it.

48:23.666 --> 48:26.768
A child's home.
It's my childhood home.

48:26.836 --> 48:29.270
It's in Vinci.

48:29.338 --> 48:32.774
Oh...
Right.

48:32.842 --> 48:34.175
I'll ready some horses.

48:34.243 --> 48:37.145
You're not coming with me.

48:37.213 --> 48:39.581
After all the nonsense this quest
of yours has put me through,

48:39.648 --> 48:42.417
how could I not?

48:47.957 --> 48:49.023
I heard you.

48:49.091 --> 48:54.362
I had faith that you
still thought of me.

48:54.430 --> 48:55.930
And you do.

48:59.969 --> 49:03.037
You do.

49:11.747 --> 49:13.815
<i>A fascinating device.</i>

49:17.920 --> 49:22.290
Yes. It's one I picked up
on my recent travels.

49:22.358 --> 49:25.360
A precious gift
from your mother.

49:25.428 --> 49:28.129
How...
She's a lot like you.

49:28.197 --> 49:34.002
And just the same, she too will pay
for the sins of Daedalus.

49:38.140 --> 49:40.842
What did you just say?
I have said enough!

49:46.782 --> 49:49.184
I knew Caterina
for years.

49:49.251 --> 49:50.985
She spoke in codes.

49:51.053 --> 49:55.356
You'll realize soon enough Vinci
is not what she meant.

49:56.692 --> 50:00.161
You?
You're The Labyrinth?

50:00.229 --> 50:02.497
We go by many names.

50:02.565 --> 50:05.533
The Bible describes the Devil
as a serpent lying in wait.

50:05.601 --> 50:08.403
That would be fitting.
Except there's only one serpent

50:08.471 --> 50:12.674
and we are as plentiful
as blades of grass.

50:12.741 --> 50:15.543
Your...
your father Cosimo

50:15.611 --> 50:17.445
was a Son of Mithras.

50:17.513 --> 50:21.816
Right until the day
I took his life.

50:21.884 --> 50:25.053
They came here when I
was just a little girl.

50:25.120 --> 50:27.789
We call them the Sun
and the Moon.

50:27.857 --> 50:32.794
The man
was dark as night.

50:32.862 --> 50:34.062
It was you.

50:34.129 --> 50:35.463
As I claimed the book
from the Vault of Heaven

50:35.531 --> 50:38.166
your mother took it
from me and vanished.

50:38.234 --> 50:42.670
She's good at that.
Disappearing.

50:42.738 --> 50:45.039
Like you
we've searched for her.

50:45.107 --> 50:49.344
She has eluded our grasp
at every turn.

50:49.411 --> 50:50.979
But she made a mistake.

50:51.046 --> 50:53.181
She left us one last way
to find the book,

50:53.249 --> 50:54.516
one last map.

50:54.583 --> 50:57.485
She left us you.

50:57.553 --> 51:00.388
And you just fulfilled
your destiny, Da Vinci.

51:00.456 --> 51:02.423
You led us right to it.

51:06.061 --> 51:07.629
<i>Is everything alright?</i>

51:07.696 --> 51:10.031
I heard a commotion.

51:10.099 --> 51:11.332
Leo.
No...

51:11.400 --> 51:13.668
No, run. Run.

51:13.736 --> 51:17.105
Run. Run.

51:18.574 --> 51:20.642
What have you
done to him?

51:20.709 --> 51:24.312
- Answer me!
-  No!

51:41.230 --> 51:42.096
<i>Who's in there?</i>

51:42.164 --> 51:44.632
<i>Call the guards!</i>
<i>Guards!</i>

51:44.700 --> 51:45.967
<i>Quickly!</i>

52:15.531 --> 52:18.866
It's alright...

52:21.070 --> 52:24.472
Oh, Maestro.

52:24.540 --> 52:25.907
I will fix this.

52:25.975 --> 52:28.076
Maestro.

52:30.546 --> 52:32.747
I swear to you.

52:35.184 --> 52:37.051
I will make this right.

52:41.256 --> 52:43.925
I know you will, my boy.

52:46.729 --> 52:50.698
You know no other way.
