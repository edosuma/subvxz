"SURPRISE ME."

09:30.269 --> 09:32.872
&gt;&gt; BUT I BET YOUR PARENTS
ARE WORRIED SICK ABOUT YOU,

09:32.939 --> 09:34.607
AREN'T THEY COSMO?

09:34.674 --> 09:38.544
&gt;&gt; [unintelligible]

09:38.611 --> 09:40.179
&gt;&gt; AND WHAT'S THAT, COSMO?

09:40.246 --> 09:42.748
WE SHOULD POOF TIMMY BACK HOME
BEFORE HE WISHES US NOT TO?

09:42.815 --> 09:43.749
OKAY!

09:43.816 --> 09:44.717
&gt;&gt; UH...

09:45.851 --> 09:47.887
THAT WAS SO UNCOOL.

09:47.954 --> 09:48.888
&gt;&gt; WEENIES.

09:48.955 --> 09:49.989
WEENIES!

09:50.056 --> 09:51.691
WHEREFORE ARE THOU,
WEENIES?

09:51.757 --> 09:53.926
&gt;&gt; HI-I-YAAH!

09:53.993 --> 09:54.894
[knocking at door]

09:54.961 --> 09:56.095
&gt;&gt; OH, TIMMY.

09:56.162 --> 09:57.296
ARE YOU HOME?

09:57.363 --> 09:58.431
&gt;&gt; SEE?

09:58.497 --> 10:00.099
I TOLD YOU
YOUR PARENTS MISSED YOU

10:00.166 --> 10:01.634
AND ARE WORRIED SICK.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.569
&gt;&gt; OKAY,
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.305
&gt;&gt; HEY, SWEETIE.

10:06.372 --> 10:09.208
YOUR FATHER AND I JUST GOT BACK
FROM OUR AMAZING SKI TRIP,

10:09.275 --> 10:10.776
AND WE WERE WONDERING...

10:10.843 --> 10:11.777
&gt;&gt; DID WE FORGET TO BRING YOU?

10:14.280 --> 10:15.548
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT IT'S OKAY.

10:15.614 --> 10:16.649
I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.

10:16.716 --> 10:17.917
&gt;&gt; both: GREAT.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.051
&gt;&gt; 'CAUSE NOW IT'S TIME
TO PACK

10:19.118 --> 10:21.420
FOR OUR TROPICAL VACATION.

10:21.487 --> 10:24.757
&gt;&gt; AND THIS TIME,
WE PROMISE NOT TO FORGET YOU.

10:24.824 --> 10:27.193
&gt;&gt; OOH, A VACATION
WITH YOUR PARENTS,

10:27.259 --> 10:29.128
A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
TO RECONNECT

10:29.195 --> 10:30.796
WITH YOUR PARENTS AND EARTH.

10:30.863 --> 10:32.298
&gt;&gt; THREE, TWO, ONE...

10:32.365 --> 10:34.066
[tires squeal]

10:34.133 --> 10:35.368
&gt;&gt; TIMMY WAS RIGHT,
YOU WERE WRONG,

10:35.434 --> 10:36.902
AND I WANT MY WEENIES BACK.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.604
&gt;&gt; AND I WANT
ALL THE OTHER STUFF.

10:38.671 --> 10:39.638
&gt;&gt; FINE.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.342
&gt;&gt; MUST ELIMINATE WEENIE.

10:43.409 --> 10:44.443
&gt;&gt; HYAH!

10:44.510 --> 10:45.344
HUMPH.
YEAH!

10:45.411 --> 10:46.312
OH.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.549
&gt;&gt; AND NOW IT'S TIME
TO GET BACK TO FAIRY WORLD.

10:50.616 --> 10:52.385
I'M AN ACTION HERO, WANDA.

10:52.451 --> 10:53.686
IF THERE'S A CRY FOR HELP,

10:53.753 --> 10:56.122
THE CHOSEN ONE MUST HEED
THAT CALL.

10:56.188 --> 10:57.957
&gt;&gt; BUT THE DARKNESS
HASN'T COME BACK,

10:58.024 --> 10:59.859
AND NOBODY IS CRYING FOR HELP.

10:59.925 --> 11:02.795
&gt;&gt; TIMMY TURNER,
LIKE, HELP!

11:04.230 --> 11:05.898
TIMMY TURNER.
HI.

11:05.965 --> 11:09.668
MY PLANET WAS, LIKE, ATTACKED
BY METAL ROBOT DUDES

11:09.735 --> 11:14.006
AND EATEN
BY A BIG SWIRLY THING OF GAS.

11:14.073 --> 11:16.175
&gt;&gt; SO THE DARKNESS IS BACK.

11:16.242 --> 11:18.310
WELL, I HOPE IT WANTS
A BIG FILET OF...

11:18.377 --> 11:20.079
THE DARKNESS IS BACK.

11:20.146 --> 11:21.947
AAAAH!

11:23.082 --> 11:25.718
&gt;&gt; SPOKEN
LIKE A TRUE ACTION HERO.

11:25.785 --> 11:28.387
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU ARE,
LIKE, THE CHOSEN ONE,

11:28.454 --> 11:30.790
AND YOU MUST HELP ME FIGHT.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.658
&gt;&gt; [laughs]
YEAH.

11:32.725 --> 11:35.327
SEE, TECHNICALLY,
I'M NOT THE CHOSEN ONE.

11:35.394 --> 11:37.263
ALTHOUGH THEY CALL ME
THE CHOSEN ONE,

11:37.329 --> 11:38.798
IT'S ACTUALLY INCORRECT,

11:38.864 --> 11:40.433
AND HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS THE CHOSEN ONE?

11:40.499 --> 11:41.767
I NEVER TOLD YOU,

11:41.834 --> 11:43.903
AND YOU'RE HOLDING ME
KIND OF TIGHT.

11:43.969 --> 11:45.538
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE I MUST...

11:45.604 --> 11:48.374
&gt;&gt; ELIMINATE TIMMY TURNER.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.443
&gt;&gt; IT'S AN ELIMINATOR!

11:50.509 --> 11:52.745
&gt;&gt; I WISH
THAT MARK ELIMINATOR WAS GONE.

11:55.481 --> 11:56.916
AAAAAH!

11:56.982 --> 11:59.051
&gt;&gt; both: TIMMY!
NO!

11:59.118 --> 12:01.420
&gt;&gt; AAAAH!

12:06.225 --> 12:09.195
&gt;&gt; YO, EARTH BUDS.

12:09.261 --> 12:10.196
SUP?

12:13.399 --> 12:15.668
&gt;&gt; THE DARKNESS IS BACK.

12:15.734 --> 12:18.270
[speaking gibberish]

12:23.809 --> 12:25.978
OH, GREATEST WARRIOR
IN THE UNIVERSE,

12:26.045 --> 12:28.180
YOU MUST HELP ME
DEFEAT THE METAL WARRIORS

12:28.247 --> 12:29.915
AND SWIRLY EVIL

12:29.982 --> 12:32.952
THAT HAS DESTROYED
MY ENTIRE PLAN-ET.

12:33.018 --> 12:35.254
[metal squeaks]

12:36.555 --> 12:38.390
&gt;&gt; AND THEY STOLE
YOUR FAKE-I-FIERS.

12:38.457 --> 12:40.926
&gt;&gt; [gasps]
A NEW FAKE-I-FIER!

12:40.993 --> 12:42.461
WITH WI-FI.

12:42.528 --> 12:43.963
SHYEAH.

12:48.801 --> 12:51.604
COOL,
I'M JUSTIN JAKE ASHTON,

12:51.670 --> 12:53.906
EARTH TEEN DREAM
WITH THREE FIRST NAMES.

12:53.973 --> 12:55.741
&gt;&gt; SO THAT'S HOW
THE ELIMINATOR WAS ABLE

12:55.808 --> 12:57.276
TO DISGUISE HIMSELF AS MARK.

12:58.811 --> 13:01.447
&gt;&gt; BUT WHY WOULD THE DARKNESS
DESTROY YUGOPOTAMIA

13:01.514 --> 13:03.349
AND NOT THE REST
OF THE UNIVERSE?

13:03.415 --> 13:05.551
&gt;&gt; MAYBE IT DOESN'T WANT
TO DESTROY THE UNIVERSE,

13:05.618 --> 13:07.753
JUST TIMMY.

13:07.820 --> 13:09.822
I MEAN, IF I TRIED
TO EAT THE UNIVERSE

13:09.889 --> 13:11.657
AND A SOFT-GLUTED BOY
STOPPED ME,

13:11.724 --> 13:14.126
I'D WANT TO TAKE HIM OUT
BEFORE I TRIED AGAIN,

13:14.193 --> 13:15.394
WOULDN'T YOU?

13:15.461 --> 13:17.997
&gt;&gt; DID COSMO JUST FIGURE
THIS WHOLE THING OUT?

13:18.063 --> 13:19.698
&gt;&gt; GOT THAT RIGHT.
CORN DOG WHAT?

13:19.765 --> 13:22.168
&gt;&gt; THIS LOOKS LIKE A JOB
FOR THE CHOSEN ONE.

13:22.234 --> 13:24.069
&gt;&gt; YES!

13:24.136 --> 13:28.007
I KNEW YOU'D, LIKE,
HELP ME, TIMMY TURNER.

13:28.073 --> 13:30.009
&gt;&gt; NOT ME.
TURBO THUNDER.

13:30.075 --> 13:32.378
THERE'S NO WAY I'M FIGHTING
THE DARKNESS AGAIN.

13:32.444 --> 13:33.612
&gt;&gt; IS THAT
YOUR NEW ACTION PHRASE?

13:33.679 --> 13:35.381
'CAUSE IT'S KIND OF LONG.

13:35.447 --> 13:37.216
&gt;&gt; WE JUST FIND TURBO THUNDER,

13:37.283 --> 13:39.418
HE FIRES HIS THUNDER PITS
AT THE DARKNESS,

13:39.485 --> 13:41.253
THE DARKNESS GOES BYE-BYE,

13:41.320 --> 13:43.589
AND I LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER
IN DIMMSDALE

13:43.656 --> 13:44.957
AND MARRY TRIXIE TANG.

13:45.024 --> 13:46.225
HI, TRIXIE!

13:46.292 --> 13:47.960
&gt;&gt; HELP! POLICE!

13:48.027 --> 13:49.428
[screams]

13:49.495 --> 13:50.696
&gt;&gt; SHE DIGS ME.

13:50.763 --> 13:53.832
NOW FIRST UP,
FIND TURBO THUNDER.

13:57.436 --> 13:59.505
&gt;&gt; THE DARKNESS IS COMING BACK.

14:02.107 --> 14:03.075
THANKS.

14:03.142 --> 14:04.310
AND YOU'LL ALL BE SORRY

14:04.376 --> 14:06.645
YOU REJECTED
THE TRUE CHOSEN ONE,

14:06.712 --> 14:09.081
TURBO THUNDER!

14:09.148 --> 14:10.416
&gt;&gt; [shrieks]

14:10.482 --> 14:12.184
&gt;&gt; I AM ONLY SORRY
I DIDN'T BAN YOU

14:12.251 --> 14:13.719
FROM FAIRY WORLD SOONER.

14:13.786 --> 14:14.887
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

14:14.954 --> 14:17.056
I'M TURBO THUNDER.

14:17.122 --> 14:18.857
YOU CAN'T BAN TURBO THUNDER
FROM...

14:20.626 --> 14:21.794
&gt;&gt; HEY,

14:21.860 --> 14:24.330
YOU JUST MISSED ME
BANNING TURBO BLUNDER

14:24.396 --> 14:25.864
FROM FAIRY WORLD.

14:25.931 --> 14:27.733
&gt;&gt; together:
OH, NO, YOU DIDN'T.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.901
&gt;&gt; WHERE IS HE?

14:28.968 --> 14:30.803
&gt;&gt; WHO KNOWS?
WHO CARES?

14:30.869 --> 14:33.772
HE KEPT RANTING,
"THE DARKNESS IS COMING BACK."

14:33.839 --> 14:35.574
[laughs]

14:35.641 --> 14:37.977
&gt;&gt; together:
THE DARKNESS <i> IS</i> COMING BACK.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.179
&gt;&gt; [laughs]
OH.

14:43.949 --> 14:45.317
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,

14:45.384 --> 14:47.586
THAT I MISSED THE HIDDEN PART
OF THE CAVE PROPHECY?

14:47.653 --> 14:49.888
TURNER, I HAVE THE EYES
OF AN EAGLE,

14:49.955 --> 14:51.190
THE SPEED OF A PUMA,

14:51.257 --> 14:52.691
AND THE WISDOM
OF A GREAT HORNED OWL.

14:52.758 --> 14:54.226
[owl hoots]

14:56.895 --> 14:58.664
&gt;&gt; "PART TWO.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.200
HOW TO FIND THE SECOND WAND?"

15:01.267 --> 15:03.335
&gt;&gt; OKAY, MAYBE IT'S THE EYES
OF A MOLE

15:03.402 --> 15:04.937
AND THE WISDOM
OF A CLOTHES HAMPER,

15:05.004 --> 15:06.905
BUT I STILL HAVE THE STRENGTH
OF A LION.

15:06.972 --> 15:08.841
&gt;&gt; THERE'S A SECOND WAND?

15:11.110 --> 15:13.078
&gt;&gt; [laughs]
CHECK IT OUT.

15:13.145 --> 15:14.513
THIS CAVE PICTURE
LOOKS LIKE

15:14.580 --> 15:16.915
THE ELIMINATORS TAKING OVER
FAIRY WORLD.

15:16.982 --> 15:18.450
[laughs]
CORN DOG WHAT?

15:22.087 --> 15:23.889
&gt;&gt; UH, THIS IS SOLID.

15:23.956 --> 15:25.124
I SAID I WANTED
MY CHOCOLATE HEART

15:25.190 --> 15:26.392
FILLED WITH NOUGAT!

15:26.458 --> 15:28.260
&gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SALAD
FOR ONCE?

15:28.327 --> 15:30.195
CARAMEL MAKES YOU IRRITABLE.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.830
NO,
WHAT MAKES ME IRRITABLE

15:31.897 --> 15:33.365
IS HOW BUSY
IT IS DOWNTOWN TODAY.

15:33.432 --> 15:36.001
WHAT IS WITH ALL THE FAIRIES?

15:36.068 --> 15:37.169
&gt;&gt; [shrieking]

15:37.236 --> 15:38.837
&gt;&gt; THOSE ARE NOT FAIRIES.

15:38.904 --> 15:40.306
THEY ARE ELIMINATORS.

15:40.372 --> 15:41.774
&gt;&gt; [shrieks]

15:46.979 --> 15:49.715
&gt;&gt; I JUST FELT A DISTURBANCE
IN THE FAIRY FORCE,

15:49.782 --> 15:52.384
LIKE A THOUSAND FAIRIES
CRIED OUT IN AGONY.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.687
WE MUST QUICKLY DECIPHER
PART TWO OF THE PROPHECY,

15:54.753 --> 15:56.889
FIND THE WAND,
AND STOP THE DARKNESS.

15:56.955 --> 15:58.257
AGAIN.

15:58.324 --> 15:59.625
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

15:59.692 --> 16:04.963
IT SAYS, "THE SECOND WAND LIES
ON THE DARK SIDE

16:05.030 --> 16:07.499
OF THE BLUE MOON."

16:07.566 --> 16:09.735
&gt;&gt; IT'S WRITTEN IN YUGOPOTAMIAN?

16:09.802 --> 16:10.969
&gt;&gt; SHYEAH.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.004
WHICH I GOT TO TELL YOU,

16:12.071 --> 16:13.706
IT'S KIND OF FREAKING ME OUT.

16:13.772 --> 16:15.140
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE FREAKED?

16:15.207 --> 16:17.943
I THINK MY MOLE VISION
SAW THOSE STALAGMITES MOVE.

16:23.415 --> 16:24.783
OUR WANDS!

16:29.688 --> 16:31.557
&gt;&gt; AAH!
HOLD ME, TURNER.

16:31.623 --> 16:34.393
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE NO POWER NOW,
CHOSEN ONE,

16:34.460 --> 16:37.196
AND I WILL FINALLY ELIMINATE
YOU.

16:37.262 --> 16:41.200
&gt;&gt; AAAH!
&gt;&gt; AAAH!

16:42.901 --> 16:45.604
&gt;&gt; WE DIDN'T SEE
THAT ESCAPE PORTAL EARLIER.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.439
&gt;&gt; AND I HAVE THE EYES
OF A PUMA.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.174
&gt;&gt; PUT THESE WITH THE OTHERS,

16:49.241 --> 16:52.778
THEN FIND
AND ELIMINATE TIMMY TURNER.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.047
&gt;&gt; WHAT DOES HE MEAN
BY "OTHERS?"

17:00.386 --> 17:02.755
&gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT KEEP
ALL OF FAIRY WORLD LOCKED UP.

17:02.821 --> 17:05.156
LOVE ALWAYS CONQUERS DARKNESS.

17:05.223 --> 17:07.459
&gt;&gt; AND MY SEXINESS
CAN NEVER BE CONTAINED.

17:07.526 --> 17:08.394
SEE?

17:11.930 --> 17:13.065
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

17:13.132 --> 17:14.867
WE'RE LOCKED IN ABRACATRAZ,

17:14.933 --> 17:17.569
FAIRY WORLD'S
MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON,

17:17.636 --> 17:19.972
AND WHO KNOWS
WHAT HAPPENED TO TIMMY.

17:22.007 --> 17:23.776
&gt;&gt; [yelling]

17:23.842 --> 17:25.109
&gt;&gt; COOL.
WE'RE WALL VOMIT.

17:25.176 --> 17:27.146
NOW, WHAT'S GOING ON, BRO?

17:27.212 --> 17:28.947
THE DARKNESS IS TRYING
TO DESTROY ME,

17:29.014 --> 17:30.382
SO I HAVE TO FIND
THE SECOND WAND

17:30.449 --> 17:32.017
AND DESTROY THE DARKNESS FIRST.

17:32.084 --> 17:33.051
AND...
OH, YEAH,

17:33.118 --> 17:34.420
YOU'RE MY NEW SIDEKICK.

17:34.486 --> 17:35.621
&gt;&gt; YEAH....

17:35.687 --> 17:37.389
NO.

17:37.456 --> 17:41.527
SEE, IT'S THE CHOSEN <i> UNO,</i>
NOT THE CHOSEN DUO.

17:41.593 --> 17:44.396
SO YOU GO OUT
AND BATTLE THE SUCKY BOTS

17:44.463 --> 17:47.566
AND THE NOT-CHOSEN ONE,
THAT'S <i> MOI,</i>

17:47.633 --> 17:49.535
WILL STAY HERE
AND NOSH

17:49.601 --> 17:51.236
ON THESE TINY TUBES
OF SPICY FLESH.

17:51.303 --> 17:52.204
[laughs]

17:52.271 --> 17:53.539
[munching sounds]

17:53.605 --> 17:54.840
&gt;&gt; MAY I REMIND YOU

17:54.907 --> 17:57.009
THAT YOU LOST YOUR ENTIRE PLANET
TO THAT THING,

17:57.075 --> 17:58.944
AND YOU READ THE PROPHECY.

17:59.011 --> 18:01.046
NOW, ARE YOU A MAN,
OR A MOUSE?

18:03.649 --> 18:05.184
&gt;&gt; LIKE, SQUEAK.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.219
&gt;&gt; FINE.
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

18:07.286 --> 18:09.154
THE DARKNESS MAY HAVE TAKEN
MY FAIRIES,

18:09.221 --> 18:12.724
BUT I HAVE THE WISDOM
OF A REALLY SMART ANIMAL

18:12.791 --> 18:16.261
