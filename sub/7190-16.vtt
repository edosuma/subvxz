- It's a dare.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.309
I already told you
the rules about a dare.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.311
You--you can't back down from--

09:22.395 --> 09:23.813
- Okay, okay.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.232
I don't want to hear
the dare lecture again.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.987
[imitating Maddie]
"Panthers, do my homework."

09:31.070 --> 09:33.364
- No, no, no, no.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.366
A magic imitation.

09:35.449 --> 09:36.909
- How do I do that?

09:36.993 --> 09:38.494
- Like this.

09:38.577 --> 09:41.998
Just focus on the person
you want to imitate and...

09:42.081 --> 09:44.375
[zapping]

09:44.458 --> 09:46.210
[Mr. Alonso's voice]
"Emma, did you go through

09:46.294 --> 09:48.045
"my private files?

09:48.129 --> 09:50.673
That's not the goody two-shoes
daughter I know."

09:52.174 --> 09:53.759
- Wow.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.886
That was both awesome
and terrifying.

09:55.970 --> 09:56.762
- Your turn.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.183
- Panthers, do my homework,
brush my hair,

10:01.267 --> 10:04.562
brush my teeth--
stat!

10:04.645 --> 10:07.189
Emma, your shoes
are hideous, ew.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.649
Oh, my Panther.

10:08.733 --> 10:12.695
- [laughs] You get
extra points for that one.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.239
- [laughs] Good, huh?

10:15.323 --> 10:16.449
Okay, my turn--
- Oh, wait.

10:16.532 --> 10:19.243
Emma, you might want
to change back.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.037
- Oh, yeah.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.205
[zapping]

10:23.289 --> 10:25.166
[clears throat]
Okay, truth or dare.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.127
- Dare.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.378
- Again?
I'm trading in my extra points

10:29.462 --> 10:31.797
to make you choose truth.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.175
- Fine. Truth.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.593
- Tell me about your family.

10:35.676 --> 10:38.596
- You're seriously gonna use
your only truth on that?

10:41.432 --> 10:43.559
Well, there's my dad,

10:43.642 --> 10:46.312
my uncle Leon,
my auntie Becky,

10:46.395 --> 10:49.982
and my cousin Bill.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.777
He's kind of the black sheep
of the family.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.070
[whispering]
He's a doctor.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.864
- And your mom?

10:58.157 --> 10:59.575
What's her name?

10:59.658 --> 11:02.411
- [normal voice]
Her name was Liana.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.831
- That's a pretty name.

11:05.915 --> 11:06.916
What happened to her?

11:09.335 --> 11:10.503
- It was a long time ago.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.296
I was only--

11:12.380 --> 11:14.423
[wall crunches]

11:14.507 --> 11:14.715
- What's that?

11:16.342 --> 11:18.761
- This wall is fake.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.807
- The ex-principal had
a secret room back there.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.725
My dad found it
and thought it was some

11:24.809 --> 11:27.436
weird medieval-themed lounge,
so he got rid of it.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.773
- Looks like he didn't get rid
of everything.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.571
- Facing off against
an ex-Chosen One gone mad,

11:37.655 --> 11:41.117
that sounds scary and awesome.
[laughs]

11:41.200 --> 11:43.953
- It was definitely
more scary than awesome.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.622
- Not scarier
than losing your powers.

11:46.705 --> 11:49.625
- It was only for a few days.
It wasn't that bad.

11:49.708 --> 11:50.960
- I couldn't even deal
with losing my powers

11:51.043 --> 11:52.503
for a few minutes.

11:52.586 --> 11:53.504
What's this?

11:53.587 --> 11:55.381
- Oh, this was her plan.

11:55.464 --> 11:56.924
This is Diego.

11:57.007 --> 11:58.634
And this is me,

11:58.717 --> 12:01.804
as she sucks my powers out
during the eclipse.

12:01.887 --> 12:02.805
- Really?

12:02.888 --> 12:03.889
This is you?

12:03.973 --> 12:06.642
You're a lot prettier
in person.

12:06.725 --> 12:08.018
- [laughs]
Well, she didn't like me,

12:08.102 --> 12:10.312
so that must have influenced
her artwork.

12:10.396 --> 12:11.897
- And what's this?

12:11.981 --> 12:13.357
Plan B?

12:13.441 --> 12:15.151
- I don't know what this is.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.318
- Well, let's have a look.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.821
This is the Fool Moon.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.449
And this is the entrance
to the Fool Moon.

12:21.532 --> 12:25.578
And this is it exploding.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.872
This is a guide to using
the last light of the Fool Moon

12:27.955 --> 12:28.497
to destroy the Realm.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.834
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

12:32.251 --> 12:34.253
- Ready?

12:35.754 --> 12:36.797
- Um, ready.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.260
- One...

12:41.343 --> 12:43.012
two...

12:43.095 --> 12:45.890
three...

12:45.973 --> 12:47.683
go.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.560
- [sighs]

12:53.272 --> 12:55.441
- My turn.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.529
- [laughs]

13:00.613 --> 13:03.949
That was...fun!
- I told you.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.368
- Why didn't we ever do
anything like this

13:06.452 --> 13:08.454
when we were dating?

13:08.537 --> 13:12.041
- Well, you were more, um,
uptight back then.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.459
- I was not!

13:13.542 --> 13:14.543
- You wouldn't even ride
the teacups at the carnival.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.546
- Those cups spin very fast.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.215
They messed up my hair.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.175
- But you're different.

13:21.258 --> 13:23.636
Now that you're dating Diego,
you've changed.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.638
- Proxy and I aren't dating.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.723
- Don't you guys
always hang out?

13:27.806 --> 13:28.933
- Yes.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.267
- And you get along
really well?

13:30.351 --> 13:33.729
- Mm, I guess.

13:33.812 --> 13:37.066
- And you care about him,
and he cares about you?

13:37.149 --> 13:38.609
- He cares about me.

13:38.692 --> 13:39.652
So?

13:39.735 --> 13:41.195
- So that's a relationship.

13:41.278 --> 13:44.823
- Mm, that's not what
I've learned from the hundreds

13:44.907 --> 13:46.742
of romantic comedies
I've seen.

13:46.825 --> 13:48.035
- And what do those teach you?

13:48.118 --> 13:49.495
- A relationship is when
you're always fighting,

13:49.578 --> 13:52.456
so you can make up by getting
them to do whatever you want.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.042
- So that's why you were
always picking fights with me.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.253
- [laughs] Yeah, duh.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.046
Isn't that why you're
in a fight with Emma?

13:59.129 --> 14:00.297
- No.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.383
We're in a fight because
she got her powers back

14:02.466 --> 14:03.717
and didn't tell me.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.511
- So you're mad at her
for being a witch?

14:05.594 --> 14:08.180
- Mm, not exactly.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.516
- But if you two were still
together, you'd want her

14:10.599 --> 14:12.184
to stop using her powers?

14:12.268 --> 14:13.686
- Maybe.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.771
- Then you don't accept Emma
for who she is.

14:15.854 --> 14:18.023
And as a fellow witch,
I'm offended for her.

14:19.942 --> 14:23.696
Wait.
Did I just defend Emma?

14:23.779 --> 14:25.698
What's happening to me?

14:25.781 --> 14:26.532
- It's the Diego effect.

14:26.615 --> 14:27.992
You should embrace it.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.498
- Hey, um,
h-how do we get down?

14:34.582 --> 14:36.584
- I don't know.
- [gasps]

14:36.667 --> 14:37.209
- Tommy!

14:37.293 --> 14:39.461
Dad!

14:39.545 --> 14:41.922
- Why would anyone want
to destroy the Magic Realm?

14:42.006 --> 14:43.465
- Lots of reasons.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.758
My mom told me that the Realm

14:44.842 --> 14:47.428
is divided into good witches
and wizards like her

14:47.511 --> 14:50.180
and bad witches
and wizards like my dad.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.016
- Oh.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.393
- She wanted me to be
a good wizard.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.978
- You are.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.688
- But I take after my dad.

14:57.771 --> 14:59.481
- That's not true.

14:59.565 --> 15:00.983
What was she like?

15:01.066 --> 15:03.235
- She was...

15:03.319 --> 15:06.113
[chuckles]
She was funny.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.699
She used to do this bit where
she pretended to be a beaver.

15:08.782 --> 15:10.451
[laughs] Tch, tch,
tch, tch, tch, tch.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.956
<i>- You take after your mother</i>

15:16.040 --> 15:17.666

15:27.092 --> 15:28.177
- No.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.511
This can't be happening.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.013
- I know!

15:31.096 --> 15:32.598
And I can't blog about it.

15:32.681 --> 15:34.808
- No, no, no!

15:36.852 --> 15:39.897
[wind roaring]

15:46.320 --> 15:48.405
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.699
That was weird.
- Very.

15:50.783 --> 15:54.286
- Maybe we should take a break
from the blueprints.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.954
- Yeah, sure.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.876
Maybe we could play
some chess.

16:00.959 --> 16:02.961
I haven't played without
my powers before, but--

16:03.045 --> 16:05.381
- How do you play
magical chess?

16:05.464 --> 16:06.465
- With real horses

16:06.548 --> 16:08.092
<i>and real knights.</i>

16:08.175 --> 16:09.718
<i>It's pretty awesome.</i>

16:16.558 --> 16:20.104
- Apple attack!

16:20.187 --> 16:20.562
- Orange assault!

16:20.646 --> 16:22.398
- Aah!

16:22.481 --> 16:23.774
[gasps]

16:23.857 --> 16:24.650
Oh!

16:24.733 --> 16:26.902
- Ha ha!

16:26.985 --> 16:28.237
Aah!

- [laughs] Wow, I've never
seen you so fired up before.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.122
And over chess.

16:38.205 --> 16:41.208
- Sorry.
It must be Andi's influence.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.752
She's competitive
about everything--

16:43.836 --> 16:45.254
swimming, chess,

16:45.337 --> 16:46.630
walking speed, you name it.

16:46.714 --> 16:47.923
- Don't apologize.

16:48.006 --> 16:50.092
I like seeing you so fired up.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.428
It reminds me of...

16:52.511 --> 16:54.304
Ah, don't worry.

16:54.388 --> 16:55.973
- What? Reminds you of what?

16:56.056 --> 16:57.266
- The other you.

16:57.349 --> 17:00.894
She was so intense and fun,
like that.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.855

I did that.

<i>Also awesome.</i>

<i>- How do you do it?</i>

17:18.871 --> 17:19.747
<i>Get along with Jax Junior?</i>

17:19.829 --> 17:21.915
- It's not complicated.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.709
He's me, and I'm him.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.752
So I just give him
whatever makes me happy.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.253
- Which is?

17:27.337 --> 17:28.922
- A turkey sandwich
and a motorbike ride.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.133
[laughs]
So how about it?

17:31.216 --> 17:33.051
Give your clone another shot.

17:33.135 --> 17:36.221
And not the lazy one

17:44.980 --> 17:47.816

- [laughs]
Stop, Jax.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.779
That tickles.

17:53.614 --> 17:57.117
- Escape attempt number 1,334.

18:01.163 --> 18:05.876
I made it.
I'm free! I'm free!

18:05.959 --> 18:07.294
Aah!

[horn honking]

18:10.756 --> 18:12.758
[breathing heavily]

18:12.841 --> 18:14.718
Excuse me, where am I?

18:14.802 --> 18:17.179
- In Los Angeles.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.598
- Limbo's in Los Angeles?

18:19.681 --> 18:21.892
Who knew?

18:25.187 --> 18:28.190
- So you gonna meet up
with your boyfriend, Diego,

18:28.273 --> 18:30.067
and tell him
you're officially a couple?

18:30.150 --> 18:31.485
- Maybe.

18:31.568 --> 18:34.196
Are you gonna go and meet up
with your witch, Emma.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.531
and tell her you accept her...

18:35.614 --> 18:37.616
witchiness?

18:37.699 --> 18:38.951
- Maybe.
- [scoffs]

18:39.034 --> 18:40.661
Look, it's more complicated
for me.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.372
Adding a fourth Panther would
make Sophie and Katie jealous,

18:43.455 --> 18:45.124
and then Diego--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.584
Diego is a Shark,
not a Panther.

18:47.668 --> 18:48.919
- Whatever.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.921
The point is, Katie's jealous

18:51.004 --> 18:52.798
of all the time I spend
with Diego.

18:52.881 --> 18:55.092
And it was kind of fun
watching them bicker at first.

can be exhausting.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.725

You're talking about me.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.478
- Or Katie.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.230
Isn't her birthday coming up?

19:08.313 --> 19:10.065
You could throw her
a surprise party.

19:10.148 --> 19:12.484

- I'm fine.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.807
Jax and I are both fine.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.392

19:47.686 --> 19:48.770
Thank you.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.147

19:50.230 --> 19:51.648
I should probably get home now.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.942
- Oh, if you wait a while,
I can check out the school,

19:54.026 --> 19:54.651
and then I can drive you home.

19:54.735 --> 19:55.736

Council meeting about?

20:13.295 --> 20:14.838
- I have proof

20:14.922 --> 20:17.633
that Emma Alonso
cloned herself.

20:17.716 --> 20:18.967
- You do?

20:19.051 --> 20:20.218
- That spell is illegal.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.680
- The Chosen One
can't be trusted

20:23.764 --> 20:25.390
and needs to be punished

20:25.474 --> 20:28.477
to the fullest extent
of the Magic Realm law.

her hands on that spell?

gave it to her.

He has always been
a troublemaker.

She made four clones.

breaking all the rules.

She knew all about it.

Didn't you?

something to me.

We are supposed to protect

to talk about the play?

they found out on their own.

- Found out what?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.947

have been multiplying.

since the third grade.

Nice try.

breaking at least
a dozen Council rules.
