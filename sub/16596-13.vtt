And look at me. Closer.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.413
I am terrified.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.052
You're not the only one.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.720
Are you terrified because
on live TV there's no way
to fix a mistake?

00:54.722 --> 00:57.222
Because that would
terrify me.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.893
Now, I'm really scared.

01:01.862 --> 01:05.397
This week, don't even say
the word "mistake."

01:05.399 --> 01:08.734
Okay. Why don't we
start rehearsing?

01:08.736 --> 01:10.402
Yes. Great. Right.

01:10.404 --> 01:14.740
The three of you are
about to stop the sale
of Monahan Academy

01:14.742 --> 01:17.309
to the evil developer,
Larrabee Peaslee.

01:18.846 --> 01:21.246
The live episode is so huge.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.582
We got a superstar to play
Larrabee Peaslee.

01:23.584 --> 01:27.786
Justin Timberlake is flying
out from New York tonight.

01:27.788 --> 01:30.089
Both: Can we meet him?
Can we meet him?

01:30.091 --> 01:32.191
Yeah, absolutely.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.196
Justin is also
hosting the show,

01:37.198 --> 01:40.299
so in between scenes,
he'll explain what's
going on backstage,

01:40.301 --> 01:42.367
interact with the live audience,

01:42.369 --> 01:48.440
and stand there
looking all...
Timbery and Lakey.

01:49.944 --> 01:52.811
Let's rehearse
Liv's show-stopping,

01:52.813 --> 01:55.314
Broadway-will-be-calling song.

01:55.316 --> 01:58.083
Liv, you go
to the top of the stairs
for your entrance

01:58.085 --> 01:59.751
and you descend.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.488
Singing, like honey

02:02.490 --> 02:04.189
poured over thunder.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.326
Um, about that, um...

02:07.328 --> 02:09.161
So, my throat has been
bothering me lately

02:09.163 --> 02:11.230
and I was hoping
to save my voice
for the live show.

02:11.232 --> 02:14.933
You know, gotta make sure
I have all that honey for
all that thunder.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.002
(both laugh)

02:17.004 --> 02:18.437
Of course.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.506
Of course, you do
what you have to do.

02:20.508 --> 02:23.609
Because you are
the fantastic Liv Rooney.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.444
And you always deliver.

02:25.446 --> 02:29.448
She is good enough
for Justin Timberlake.

02:29.450 --> 02:30.716
Are the rest of you!

02:37.358 --> 02:39.625
Your throat's been
bothering you for weeks.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.293
That can't be good.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.028
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.330
We've just been rehearsing
a lot, you know,
it's just tired.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.065
So totally normal.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.970
This isn't normal.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.506
She sings every time
we rehearse.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.575
I'm really worried
about her, Priya.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.044
I should say something
to her mom.

02:59.046 --> 03:01.180
I think it's a mistake not to.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.183
Who just said "mistake"?

Sorry, Liv,
I'm really worried
about you.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.424
I had to say
something.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.759
Oh.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.527
Well, Ruby...

04:22.529 --> 04:24.930
I really appreciate
your concern,

04:24.932 --> 04:28.267
but I think you're all
overreacting.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.669
Oh, are we, Liv? Are we?

04:34.308 --> 04:37.276
Okay. Okay.
Yeah, I am. I am.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.046
Really, my voice is just tired
from a long season.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.614
I'm fine.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.616
Liv, honey, I made you
an appointment to see
the doctor.

04:44.618 --> 04:48.220
Yeah, and Liv, you're going
so do not even try to fight.

04:48.222 --> 04:49.721
Okay, I'll go.

04:49.723 --> 04:50.789
Liv, I said--

04:50.791 --> 04:52.557
Really?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.229
Well, that was easier
than I thought it would be.

04:58.666 --> 05:02.634
I mean, I'm pretty positive
that everything's fine,

05:02.636 --> 05:04.636
but if it will make you guys
feel better, I'll go.

05:04.638 --> 05:07.139
It sounds like you
are under reacting.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.774
Joey, overreact.

05:08.776 --> 05:11.176
Okay. This isn't about us,

05:11.178 --> 05:12.511
Liv,

05:12.513 --> 05:14.313
this is about you!

05:17.151 --> 05:19.484
-Nailed that.
-Oh, thanks, buddy.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.153
Oh.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.524
Thanks for driving me, Joey.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.693
Uh-huh, yeah.
Where's Justin Timberlake?

05:27.695 --> 05:29.194
(sighs)

05:29.196 --> 05:31.330
J.T.'s flight
got delayed.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.631
(groans)

05:32.633 --> 05:34.599
We've been practicing
our cool guy handshake.

05:34.601 --> 05:37.202
Starts up here,
ends-- ba-cha!

05:37.204 --> 05:39.204
Right down here
in friendship town.

05:41.141 --> 05:45.544
You know, I think I saw
a cool guy somewhere not
on this set.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.079
Why don't you guys
go find him?

05:48.549 --> 05:50.716
Okay. Ruby, in this scene,

05:50.718 --> 05:54.319
you sneak back into the theater
using the elaborate tunnels
you've built

05:54.321 --> 05:56.188
under Monahan Academy.

05:58.359 --> 06:01.059
Whoa. Sounds like
the Parker Tunnels.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.695
You call them the Sasha Tunnels.

06:03.697 --> 06:07.065
They're exactly
the Parker Tunnels.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.536
You're putting
my tunnels on TV?

06:11.538 --> 06:12.738
Pretty cool, huh?

06:12.740 --> 06:14.639
Yeah, how much
am I getting paid?

06:14.641 --> 06:17.709
What if I make you famous?

06:19.213 --> 06:22.447
-I'm listening.
-And I am standing
next to him.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.218
During the live show,
we'll be cutting
to viewers at home.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.653
We can send a camera
to your house

06:28.655 --> 06:31.656
and give you
thirty seconds
of airtime.

06:31.658 --> 06:34.459
You'll become
semi-celebrities.

I thought it was Liv,
finally home from the doctor.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.293
-She's not back yet?
-No.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.462
-Is that bad?
-I mean, it can't
be good.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.597
Doctors never say,
"Everything's fine.

07:12.599 --> 07:15.367
Just, why don't you stick
around all afternoon."

07:16.770 --> 07:18.703
Okay, Joey,
you're freaking me out.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.041
Hey! Hey, what happened?
What did the--

07:23.043 --> 07:24.576
What'd the doctor say?

07:24.578 --> 07:25.710
Um...

07:27.915 --> 07:29.481
Mom, can you say?

07:30.784 --> 07:32.117
So...

07:33.086 --> 07:34.686
Liv has vocal nodes.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.123
They're like little blisters
on your vocal chords

07:38.125 --> 07:41.393
and if you don't treat them,
they can destroy your voice.

07:43.130 --> 07:46.198
Okay. How do you
treat them?

07:48.001 --> 07:49.801
(smacks lips) Um...

07:49.803 --> 07:51.937
I need a surgery.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.806
Basically,
as soon as possible.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.141
Whoa.

07:57.778 --> 07:58.877
Um...

08:00.581 --> 08:03.582
but then, you'll be okay
after that?

08:03.584 --> 08:06.418
I don't know.

08:06.420 --> 08:08.920
There's a chance
that my singing voice

08:08.922 --> 08:10.922
may never come back
after the surgery.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.459
Julie Andrews had it done,

08:14.461 --> 08:16.628
and she was never able
to sing the same way again.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.798
But Adele had it, and she
got her voice back completely.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.034
So sweetie, we just--
We just have to
hope for the best.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.873
The doctor told me to stop
singing now to...

08:27.875 --> 08:29.741
prevent any further damage.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.780
Liv, I'm so sorry.

08:35.782 --> 08:38.550
What about
the live show tomorrow?

08:38.552 --> 08:41.887
I'm gonna have to tell Gemma
that I can't do ♪ Sing-- ♪

08:43.490 --> 08:44.923

08:47.728 --> 08:50.929
Well, don't tell me
I'm overreacting now.
This is bad!

08:54.835 --> 08:56.968
Okay, five minutes
to tech rehearsal.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.704
Camera three,
check your back focus.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.475
Hey, Gemma.

09:03.477 --> 09:04.843
Oh.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.578
Um, there's something that
I need to talk to you about.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.813
Oh, anything
for my star.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.348
(phone chimes)

09:10.350 --> 09:11.650
Oh, one sec.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.851
Okay.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.286

09:21.562 --> 09:24.829
Um... was that something
important?

09:24.831 --> 09:27.566
Mm-mm. Mm-hmm.

09:29.036 --> 09:33.071
Justin Timberlake's plane
is grounded in New York
because-- Who cares why!

09:33.073 --> 09:34.739
He's not gonna
get here on time.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.576
I mean, my career is ruined.
The show is ruined.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.177
(sighs)

09:39.179 --> 09:41.746
I mean...

09:41.748 --> 09:44.583
I'm sure it's not
that bad.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.052
You're right.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.853
I still have you.

09:48.855 --> 09:50.522
My rock.

09:50.524 --> 09:52.857
My golden-throated
song bird.

09:52.859 --> 09:55.260
This is a triumphant moment.

09:55.262 --> 09:59.431
I mean, the whole world
will hear Liv Rooney's
magnificent singing voice.

10:00.467 --> 10:02.033
Now, what did you
want to say to me?

10:07.374 --> 10:08.773
Just...

10:09.977 --> 10:13.144
that tonight is gonna be
so amazing.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.047
And I can't wait
to sing.

10:16.049 --> 10:20.118
Oh, Liv,
you give me strength.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.822
Everyone, get on your phones!
We need a new Larrabee Peaslee.

10:23.824 --> 10:27.826
Find me a major celebrity
or just someone who looks
like Justin Timberlake!

10:29.162 --> 10:32.998
Liv, honey,
you cannot do the show.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.968
I know, Mom,
and I hear you,
but you don't understand.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.472
I have to sing.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.019
Munch,

10:54.021 --> 10:57.656

11:08.635 --> 11:11.169

11:15.676 --> 11:19.010

my newest invention.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.752
It's underwear...

11:29.022 --> 11:31.022
that makes your farts
smell like bacon.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.959

11:46.006 --> 11:49.674
But, it's a super gross
product, so we have to keep
our message classy.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.376
Mm. M'kay,
that makes sense.
That makes sense.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.311
Oh, oh, oh!

11:53.313 --> 11:56.481
A classy slogan
just came to me.

11:57.584 --> 11:58.950
Release the fog...

12:00.020 --> 12:02.454
smell the hog.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.892
Not gonna lie,
I love it!

12:07.894 --> 12:11.663
But I think that we have to
go even a little classier.

12:11.665 --> 12:13.498
Okay, I understand.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.568
I don't know if I can grow
a mustache by tonight,
but I will definitely try.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.970
(grunts)

12:26.079 --> 12:28.780
Titles are rolling.
Okay, we have thirty seconds

12:28.782 --> 12:30.882
before we go live
to the whole country.

12:30.884 --> 12:34.085
So, who'd you get
to replace Justin Timberlake
as host of the show?

12:34.087 --> 12:36.187
Was Hugh Jackman available?
Because I'm a fan.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.922
Better.

12:37.924 --> 12:42.961
We got a star who
really understands the gravitas
of live television.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.130
All right, people,
come on. And...

12:45.132 --> 12:46.865
Cue the host.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.934
-(cheers and applause)
-Hello, America!

12:49.936 --> 12:53.738
That includes you,
Puerto Rico, Guam,
and American Samoa!

12:53.740 --> 12:56.341
You hired your husband
to host the show?

12:57.377 --> 12:59.444
Karen, he was
the best man for the job.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.147
He's the best man for every job.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.983
<i>I'm your host,</i>
<i>Johnny Nimbus.</i>

13:04.985 --> 13:08.119
And I got a question for you.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.722
Are you ready
to ♪ Sing it Live? ♪

13:10.724 --> 13:14.058
Well, let's take a trip over
to Monahan Academy.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.860
(cheers and applause)

13:22.669 --> 13:24.068
What's wrong?

13:24.070 --> 13:26.771
The Monahan Academy
Talent Show
is tonight.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.006
I thought you'd be
so excited.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.175
How can I be excited?

13:30.177 --> 13:34.145
Larrabee Peaslee
is going to close
Monahan Academy.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.348
No, we are not

13:37.350 --> 13:39.517
going to let
that happen.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.187
That rich jerk
is gonna be
at the show tonight.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.489
We could steal the documents
that prove that he doesn't
own the school

13:44.491 --> 13:46.357
and show everyone
what a liar he is.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.992
How?

13:47.994 --> 13:50.428
Through the power
of two.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.298

13:53.300 --> 13:55.166

14:00.207 --> 14:01.773

14:01.775 --> 14:04.843
Mom! I thought
Liv wasn't gonna sing?

14:04.845 --> 14:07.111
She didn't want
to let everyone down.

14:07.113 --> 14:10.215
(scoffs) But the doctor said
that singing could make
things so much worse

14:10.217 --> 14:12.517
and she still has that
gigantic song at the end
of the show.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.986
I know, and I tried to stop her
but she would not listen.

14:14.988 --> 14:17.522
All right, I'm her twin.
Let me go talk to her.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.023
Ruby and Liv:
<i>♪ Power of two ♪</i>

14:19.025 --> 14:21.226
And go to commercial break.

14:21.228 --> 14:24.229
We just nailed that act break.

14:24.231 --> 14:27.532
All of America can't wait
to see what happens next.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.638
(cheers and applause)

14:33.640 --> 14:35.340
Wow!

14:35.342 --> 14:38.509
Welcome back
to ♪<i> Sing it Live ♪</i>

14:38.511 --> 14:42.013
Hey, everybody, we are getting
ever so close to that
big finish.

14:42.015 --> 14:45.049
But first, let's check in
with some fans watching at home.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.552
We'll swing on out
to Santa Luego, California

14:47.554 --> 14:48.820
and meet Joey
and Parker.

14:48.822 --> 14:51.589
<i>Hey boys!</i>
<i>Oh, you are looking</i>
<i>classy.</i>

14:51.591 --> 14:53.091
(classical music plays)

14:53.093 --> 14:55.226
Why thank you,
Mr. Nimbus.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.930
Oh. Oh, dear.

15:00.867 --> 15:03.268
-Ooh.
-What's the rumpus, chum?

15:03.270 --> 15:06.604
Oh, the rumpus
is coming from my rump.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.940
Oh. Oh.

15:08.942 --> 15:13.077
I do believe I may ruin
our tea with a noxious emission
from my posterior.

15:14.781 --> 15:18.950
Worry not, old sport.
Slap on some Bacon Briefs.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.452
Oh.

15:21.454 --> 15:27.358
I give them thirty seconds
of air time and this is what
they do with it?

15:27.360 --> 15:29.861
Each pair of underwear
transforms the odor

15:29.863 --> 15:31.696
of your body's
gaseous expulsions

15:31.698 --> 15:34.866
into the delicious
smell of bacon.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.303
Oh, my word.

15:39.105 --> 15:42.140
They turn flatulence...
(sniffs)

15:42.142 --> 15:43.408
into decadence.

15:43.410 --> 15:47.245
<i>You can trust the strips</i>
<i>and let one rip.</i>

15:47.247 --> 15:50.615
<i>Joey:</i>
<i>I cannot wait to try this</i>
<i>marvelous invention at home...</i>

15:50.617 --> 15:53.451
Karen Rooney,
your sons are disgusting.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.956
Bacon Briefs?
Oh, how about it, folks?

15:57.958 --> 16:00.291
I smell a gold mine!

16:01.661 --> 16:03.428
All right, let's get
back to the show

16:03.430 --> 16:06.597
because the Monahan kids
are gonna try to save
their school

16:06.599 --> 16:07.966
at the talent show.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.902
We have one more scene
before Liv takes the stage

16:10.904 --> 16:13.404
and ends our show with
the beautiful sound
of her singing.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.239
Um...

16:15.241 --> 16:17.575
Gemma, about that.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.243
What?

16:19.245 --> 16:22.647
What has your horrible,
horrible family done to me now?

16:24.951 --> 16:26.617
Liv needs throat surgery

16:26.619 --> 16:29.120
and Maddie has gone
to stop her from singing.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.655
What?

16:30.657 --> 16:34.459
<i>Ah, the guests are arriving</i>
<i>here at Monahan Academy</i>
<i>for the talent show.</i>

16:34.461 --> 16:37.495
Including the diabolical
Larrabee Peaslee

16:37.497 --> 16:39.464
who recently purchased
the school.

16:39.466 --> 16:44.168
In fact... I believe
I see him now.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.375
(with accent)
Hello.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.477
Larrabee Peaslee here.

16:52.479 --> 16:56.381
-(booing)
-I do hope that you're enjoying
your little talent show.

16:56.383 --> 17:00.051
For it will be the last one ever
at Monahan Academy.

17:00.053 --> 17:03.221
For I plan on
bulldozing it tomorrow.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.822
(laughs evilly)

17:04.824 --> 17:10.294
-Wow, he's really...
horrible. Oh.
-Magnificent. Oh.

17:12.665 --> 17:18.703
For my first illusion,
I will make Sasha...
disappear.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.745
North, South, East, Westo,

17:27.747 --> 17:30.281
disappear with a presto!

17:40.593 --> 17:41.993
Priya:
She's lost
in the Netherworld...

17:41.995 --> 17:43.327
-Liv.
-Maddie.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.730
What are you doing here?
It's almost my cue to sing.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.231
I'm not letting you sing.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.766
Presto!

17:52.338 --> 17:56.107
This magic trick
isn't the only
trick tonight.

17:56.109 --> 17:59.210
These documents are phony.

17:59.212 --> 18:03.214
Larrabee Peaslee
doesn't own Monahan Academy.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.450
-(sputters) But I--
-(crowd booing)

18:05.452 --> 18:08.920
You miserable kids
ruined my perfect plan!

18:10.023 --> 18:13.357
Monahan Academy
lives to fight another day.

18:14.761 --> 18:18.262
And now, the grand finale
of the talent show,

18:18.264 --> 18:20.264
Stephanie Einstein!

18:26.606 --> 18:29.307
Maddie, that's my cue.
I have to get out there
and sing.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.375
Liv, you could
ruin your voice!

18:31.377 --> 18:32.477
Forever!

18:33.713 --> 18:34.946
Where's Liv?

18:34.948 --> 18:37.348
This is dead air
going out to
a national audience.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.484
(clears throat)

18:39.486 --> 18:40.885
Little girl,

18:40.887 --> 18:43.754
you know, this reminds
old Larrabee of the tale

18:43.756 --> 18:46.524
of the elephant
and the snow globe.
Ever heard of it?

18:47.760 --> 18:49.260
Well, I should
tell you then.

18:49.262 --> 18:52.130
You see, there was
a brave elephant

18:52.132 --> 18:53.831
who wanted to cross
the Himalayas.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.833
What is he doing?

18:55.835 --> 19:00.071
He is filling the dead air
with sweet, sweet
Nimbus nonsense.

19:00.073 --> 19:01.339
He's saving the show?

19:01.341 --> 19:03.307
Back off, Karen.
He is mine.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.612
Singing is so important to you.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.780
Do you really want
to risk your voice?

19:09.782 --> 19:13.618
It may never come back anyway.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.953
The doctor said there's
no guarantee that my voice

19:15.955 --> 19:19.857
is even gonna be
okay after the surgery.

19:19.859 --> 19:23.294
Liv, just please don't do this
just because you think
everyone's counting on you.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.263
No, I'm not, Maddie.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.198
I'm doing this for me.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.768
Am I scared?
I'm so scared.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.940
But this may be
the last song that
I ever sing.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.344
You know, I have to sing it.

19:47.554 --> 19:48.786
Hey, Liv.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.321
Yeah?

19:50.323 --> 19:51.522
You knock 'em dead.

19:55.828 --> 19:59.230
So the elephant is trying
to step on the snow globe.
He was--

20:02.168 --> 20:05.736
Uh, but he decided
snow globes need love too.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.505
The end.

20:07.507 --> 20:10.208
Uh, Sasha, I believe
you were saying something.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.442
Oh, um...

20:14.247 --> 20:17.982
And now, for the grand finale

Oh, I'm so proud of you.

we'll get you to a hospital.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.584

23:06.586 --> 23:09.220

23:09.222 --> 23:11.555
Uh, 937,000.

23:11.557 --> 23:15.393
