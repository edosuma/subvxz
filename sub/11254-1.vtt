00:02.335 --> 00:04.421
- Church, we need volunteers
over at our food pantry.

00:04.504 --> 00:07.006
Now the sign-up sheets
are right outside the door.

00:07.090 --> 00:10.385
You see, it's not enough
to just scream out

00:10.468 --> 00:11.761
how much you love God.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.430
- Mm-hmm.

00:13.513 --> 00:17.600
- It's not about your "Jesus
Is My Homeboy" bumper sticker

00:17.684 --> 00:19.811
or your praying hand emojis.

00:19.894 --> 00:21.479
- Preach, Boyce.
- Amen.

00:21.563 --> 00:25.442
- So let's turn those amens
into some signatures.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.609
- Yeah!
- Amen!

00:26.693 --> 00:28.153
- Amen!
- Amen!

00:28.236 --> 00:29.779
- Tell us!
- Amen!

00:29.863 --> 00:32.824
- Dad, would you look at this?

00:32.907 --> 00:34.451
Nobody signed up.

00:34.534 --> 00:37.328
{\an1}All them "Amens"
and "Tell it, Pastors,"

00:37.412 --> 00:38.621
those were fake.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.707
{\an3}- Did you put a pen
on a string?

00:40.790 --> 00:43.084
{\an1}- Yes, I put a pen
on a string.

00:43.168 --> 00:46.796
{\an3}- Well, you did everything
you could do.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.549
{\an1}- You know what, Dad,
nobody wants to get involved.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.092
When I first got the calling,

00:51.176 --> 00:53.136
{\an1}I thought I was gonna
help people.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.888
You know, change some lives.

00:54.971 --> 00:58.475
{\an1}Now I'm wondering
if I'm having any effect at all.

00:58.558 --> 01:02.103
{\an1}Lollipop, baby,
look at this.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.980
- Wow, this is--

01:04.063 --> 01:06.649
this is great.

01:06.733 --> 01:10.820
- It's great that nobody signed
up to help at our food pantry?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.489
- Uh--uh, yes,

01:12.572 --> 01:16.493
{\an3}because now there's more room
for me to sign up.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.911
- Come on, Lolli.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.954
{\an1}Admit it.
You can't even read this.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.581
You got to call the eye doctor.

01:21.664 --> 01:24.876
- Boyce, I'm not having
my eyes checked, okay?

01:24.959 --> 01:27.504
{\an1}So those quacks can tell me
I got glaucoma

01:27.587 --> 01:30.840
or cataracts or scurvy.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.176
{\an3}- Scurvy?
You not a pirate.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.929
- Tell that to the quacks!

01:36.012 --> 01:37.972
{\an3}- Well, fine, if you're not
gonna call the doctor,

01:38.056 --> 01:40.099
{\an3}then you can work
at the food pantry.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.394
- Oh, fine.
- All right.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.437
{\an1}- Boom.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.855
{\an3}- Whoa.
[chuckles]

01:45.939 --> 01:48.525
{\an3}6:00 a.m. shift.
That is impressive.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.568
- Oh, say what now?

01:50.652 --> 01:51.820
{\an1}Wha--

01:51.903 --> 01:52.946
Yeah, I'ma--

01:53.029 --> 01:54.781
{\an1}I'ma go on
and call the eye doctor.

01:54.864 --> 01:57.075

03:39.719 --> 03:40.762

03:40.845 --> 03:42.889
- Okay, all right.

03:46.059 --> 03:50.146
Hi, I got this moving
violation back in January,

03:50.229 --> 03:52.649
but I had to wait for
my next paycheck to cover it

03:52.732 --> 03:54.317
because, well,
I-I'd just bought

03:54.400 --> 03:57.153
that remote control "Star Wars"
droid that rolls around,

03:57.236 --> 03:58.446
which, by the way, is amazing.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.073
See, it has this app
that you can use--

04:00.156 --> 04:01.824
{\an1}- Stamps,
would you get on with it?

04:01.908 --> 04:03.117
- Oh, right.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.495
Anyway, when I finally
had the money to cover it,

04:05.578 --> 04:07.497
they told me I owed a late fee,

04:07.580 --> 04:09.832
which I couldn't afford until
<i>that</i> week's paycheck came in,

04:09.916 --> 04:12.961
because, well, I'd rolled
my first droid off a balcony

04:13.044 --> 04:14.545
and had to buy a new one.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.589
- Sir, if there's a late fee,

04:16.673 --> 04:19.341
{\an3}you have to pay that at
Collections on the third floor.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.843
{\an3}- I'll have to find you
in the system.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.220
Can I see your driver's license?

04:22.303 --> 04:23.972
- Well, the cop took it.

04:24.055 --> 04:27.392
{\an3}- Oh, then you're gonna need
a temporary identification card.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.310
{\an1}- Okay, well,
just give us one.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.062
- That's $15.

04:31.145 --> 04:33.272
{\an1}- $15?

04:33.356 --> 04:34.899
Fine, we'll pay it.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.026
{\an3}- Payments are
on the second floor.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.903
{\an3}- Attach your check,
fill this out,

04:38.987 --> 04:40.321
but don't write in this box.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.739
Any marks in the box,
we have to start over.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.658
- So why is there a box?

04:43.741 --> 04:46.411
{\an3}- It shows you
where not to write.

04:46.494 --> 04:49.247
{\an3}Just complete that
and take it up to three.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.207
{\an3}- Okay, everything
looks in order.

04:51.290 --> 04:52.709
{\an1}- Great.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.003
- You'll have your license
within ten business days.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.254
- Ten days?

04:56.337 --> 04:57.964
How am I even supposed
to get to work?

04:58.047 --> 05:00.967
{\an1}- Ma'am, he can't afford
to miss two more weeks of work.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.594
All right, there's got to be
a way to get this done today.

05:03.678 --> 05:06.973
{\an3}- Sorry, but the only way would
be to use the expedited form.

05:07.056 --> 05:09.767
- So why aren't we using
the expedited form?

05:09.851 --> 05:12.061
{\an3}- He didn't ask
for the expedited form.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.064
- Well, you didn't tell him
you had an expedited form.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.359
- Don't you get snippy with me.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.819
Here you go.

05:19.902 --> 05:23.656
{\an3}There's $130 convenience fee
for expedited processing.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.034
- For a $55 ticket?

05:26.117 --> 05:28.036
{\an1}- By the time I pay
the convenience fees,

05:28.119 --> 05:29.412
the handling fees,
and the late fees,

05:29.495 --> 05:31.247
{\an1}I won't be able to afford
to pay the ticket.

05:31.330 --> 05:35.460
{\an3}- You can fill out the financial
hardship application...

05:35.543 --> 05:37.003
{\an3}on one.

05:37.086 --> 05:41.632
- Hold on, so the financial
hardship application costs $25?

05:41.716 --> 05:43.760
- No, the application is free.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.179
The processing fee is $25.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.555
- You know what?

05:47.638 --> 05:49.682
This man just wants
to pay his traffic ticket

05:49.766 --> 05:51.225
so he can get his life back,
all right?

05:51.309 --> 05:54.062
I demand somebody
who can help me with that.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.439
Who's in charge
of all these damn windows?

05:56.522 --> 05:59.067
{\an1}- Sir, I have to ask you
to calm down.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.401
- I am calm!

06:00.485 --> 06:01.944
- You're losing your temper.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.030
{\an3}- That's because you're saying
I'm not calm.

06:04.113 --> 06:06.282
{\an3}But I have
a legitimate complaint.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.659
My brother had a $55 ticket,

06:08.743 --> 06:11.496
and now it's a $250 ticket,

06:11.579 --> 06:13.289
and y'all won't even let him
pay it!

06:13.372 --> 06:16.501
{\an1}- Sir, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.294
- [scoffs]
Oh, you want me to leave?

06:18.377 --> 06:19.796
Now all of a sudden--
I've been here all day,

06:19.879 --> 06:21.089
and you tryin'
to ask me to leave.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.423
Only way I'm leavin' out
of here

06:22.507 --> 06:23.508
is you gonna have to tase me.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.009
- Tase him.
- Yeah, partner.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.594
You have to--oh, don't tase me.

06:26.677 --> 06:27.887
Ooh, don't tase me with that.

06:27.970 --> 06:31.099
That man was actually
gonna tase me.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.518
Stamps!

06:37.563 --> 06:39.232
- That was embarrassing.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.692
I've never heard so much
screaming and carrying on

06:41.776 --> 06:43.861
at the eye doctor's.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.988
- It's not my fault, Barton.

06:46.072 --> 06:49.492
{\an3}They shined a bright light
in my eyes.

06:49.575 --> 06:52.453
{\an3}They held my eyelids open
and put drops in there!

06:52.537 --> 06:55.998
{\an3}And then they interrogated me!
Right?

06:56.082 --> 06:58.417
They were screaming
all kind of stuff.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.671
{\an3}What letter is this?
Is that a Q?

07:01.754 --> 07:02.672
Is that a G?

07:02.755 --> 07:06.008
Like I don't know my letters!

07:06.092 --> 07:08.678
{\an1}- Lolli, look,
there's no reason to fight this.

07:08.761 --> 07:12.223
We all get old.

07:12.306 --> 07:14.183
- Who is "we"?

07:14.267 --> 07:17.812
{\an3}I'm <i> way</i> younger than you,
Barton.

07:17.895 --> 07:21.649
{\an1}- But I don't need glasses,
do I?

07:21.732 --> 07:24.527
I think I'll read the paper...

07:24.610 --> 07:26.696
with my naked eyes.

07:28.322 --> 07:31.075
- Oh, Barton, I'm sorry.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.078
{\an3}It's just that I don't want
Boyce to see me

07:34.162 --> 07:38.374
{\an3}as some old
eyeglass-wearing lady.

07:38.457 --> 07:41.752
Lollipop keeps it spicy.

07:41.836 --> 07:42.712
- I know you do.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.006
I walked in on you three times.

07:45.089 --> 07:47.008
{\an3}- Oh, you know what,
and I'm sorry.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.510
{\an3}Boyce and I will start
locking the door.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.263
- Once was in the backyard.

07:52.346 --> 07:56.142
{\an3}- Right.
[laughs nervously]

07:56.225 --> 07:58.477
{\an1}- Look, Lolli, I know
what you're worried about.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.606
But trust me, Della and I
were married for 41 years.

08:01.689 --> 08:05.234
{\an3}- And you guys were able to keep
the fire going that long?

08:05.318 --> 08:07.570
- Oh, God, no.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.740
{\an1}But a long marriage
isn't about fire.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.992
It's about companionship.

08:13.075 --> 08:18.581
It's about going out to dinner
at 5:00 and beatin' the crowd.

08:18.664 --> 08:23.502
Helpin' each other find the car
in the parking lot at the mall.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.713
{\an1}Listenin' to the Cardinals
on the radio

08:25.796 --> 08:28.591
{\an1}while the woman you love
shaves your neck.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.509
- Thank you, uh, Barton.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.804
{\an3}I have so much
to look forward to.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.640
- Oh, my goodness.
I can't believe it.

08:35.722 --> 08:38.392
{\an1}I mean, 3 hours,
7 different lines,

08:38.476 --> 08:39.769
20 different forms.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.979
{\an1}We had the money,
and they still wouldn't take it.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.981
- Yeah, it's like they
didn't want me to pay my ticket.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.399
{\an3}- Well,
why would they do that?

08:45.483 --> 08:47.235
- Baby, that's how they get you.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.987
You know, they just keep
adding on penalties

08:50.071 --> 08:52.615
until you owe them
for the rest of your life.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.116
- What do you expect, son?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.369
The expression is,
"You can't fight city hall."

08:56.452 --> 08:58.246
{\an1}Not, "Go ahead
and fight city hall.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.789
"That's a good thing to do.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.124
You'll almost definitely win."

09:05.253 --> 09:07.755
- I tried to pay a ticket
ten days after I got it.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.257
{\an1}They told me
it was already late.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.300
{\an1}They had sent it
to a collection agency.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.927
- What was your ticket for?

09:13.010 --> 09:16.430
- You know those signs with
the man sitting on the circle?

09:16.514 --> 09:18.849
- Handicap signs.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.851
- Oh, no, I'm talking about
the blue ones

09:20.935 --> 09:24.146
that they paint
on the parking spots.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.481
- Handicap signs.

09:25.564 --> 09:27.858
- Apparently, you're
not supposed to park there

09:27.942 --> 09:31.988
unless you got a matching sign
for your car.

09:32.071 --> 09:35.491
- 'Cause you not handicapped.
- It's a handicap spot.

09:35.574 --> 09:38.911
- Well, whatever it was,

09:38.995 --> 09:41.831
my fine is growing faster
than I can pay it.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.124
If I could just pay it off,

09:43.207 --> 09:46.877
I wouldn't have to steal
so much Splenda.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.921
{\an3}- How much Splenda
do you need?

09:49.005 --> 09:50.423
- Some I keep,

09:50.506 --> 09:54.010
some I sell.

09:54.093 --> 09:57.221
- Hey, this is bad.
This is bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.514
{\an3}- I know.

09:58.597 --> 10:02.351
She ain't the only one
who want sweet coffee.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.395
{\an1}- No, babe, I'm talking
about the city

10:04.478 --> 10:06.772
{\an1}and the way that they just
jackin' people up.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.983
{\an1}And Shirley, well, that is--
you know what?

10:09.066 --> 10:11.861
{\an1}We been to Costco
like three times this week.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.824
Brothers and sisters,
by show of hands,

10:16.907 --> 10:19.910
how many of you have gotten
a simple traffic ticket

10:19.994 --> 10:25.124
that has spiraled into
a never-ending cycle of debt?

10:25.207 --> 10:27.376
Uh-huh, yeah.
See, that's what I thought.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.671
Church,
let me break this down to you.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.424
37% of the city's
operating budget

10:33.507 --> 10:36.969
comes from traffic fines
and late fees.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.430
It's like the police
aren't servin' and protectin',

10:39.513 --> 10:41.390
they're servin' and collectin'.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.683
- That's right.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.769
- And Mayor Saxby needs
to understand

10:44.852 --> 10:46.187
what a problem this is.

10:46.270 --> 10:47.271
- Oh, yeah!

10:47.355 --> 10:48.773
- So--so I need all of you

10:48.856 --> 10:53.152
to call his office,
and send emails, and fax.

10:53.235 --> 10:55.946
Daddy, you can write a letter.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.532
Now y'all remember
four years ago

10:58.616 --> 11:01.077
when Mayor Saxby was first
running for office, huh?

11:01.160 --> 11:02.620
- Mm-hmm.
- Absolutely.

11:02.703 --> 11:06.207
- He would come down here
and shake hands and kiss babies.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.876
But now that we need him,
where is he?

11:08.959 --> 11:11.420
In Arizona playing golf!

11:11.504 --> 11:14.215
Well, Mayor Saxby,
we need you here!

11:14.298 --> 11:15.591
- Right now!
- Show your face!

11:15.674 --> 11:19.095
all: Show your face!
Show your face!

11:19.178 --> 11:22.014
Show your face!
Show your face!

11:22.098 --> 11:25.851
- Uh, I've just been informed
that Mayor Saxby

11:25.935 --> 11:28.938
is actually in Arizona
for a funeral.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.606
Okay?
So...

11:30.689 --> 11:32.900
- [inaudible whisper]

11:32.983 --> 11:35.194
- His grandmama died.

11:35.277 --> 11:39.115
So let's say a prayer
for Nana Saxby.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.116
Amen.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.784
all: Amen.

11:41.867 --> 11:46.914
- But still, we demand
that Mayor Saxby show his face

11:46.997 --> 11:49.583
and address our concerns...

11:49.667 --> 11:53.462
after a reasonable period
of mourning.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.631
Show your face.
all: Show your face.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.675
- Show your face.
all: Show your face!

11:57.758 --> 11:59.301
- Show it!
all: Show your face!

11:59.385 --> 12:01.053
- Show your face.
all: Show your face!

12:01.137 --> 12:02.638
- I want to see your face.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.432
I'ma need some face time.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.017
Face the fact!
Face it!

12:09.562 --> 12:11.397
{\an3}- Uh-huh, good.
I look forward to it.

12:11.480 --> 12:15.192
{\an3}Babe, just got off the phone
with Mayor Saxby's office.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.652
{\an1}- And?

12:16.735 --> 12:17.820
{\an3}- He's coming
to the service on Sunday.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.655
{\an3}We did it.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.574
{\an1}- Ah!
I'm so proud of you, Boyce!

12:21.657 --> 12:23.159
- Oh, baby, it's not just me.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.827
It was the whole congregation.

12:24.910 --> 12:28.330
{\an3}The mayor's office said he got
hundreds of faxes and emails

12:28.414 --> 12:32.168
and one letter.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.086
Come on, let's go celebrate.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.671
I am starving, man.

12:35.754 --> 12:37.465
- Well, Boyce, it's just 5:00.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.259
{\an1}- I know.
We can beat the crowd.

12:40.342 --> 12:43.929
{\an3}- Boyce, we are not
going to dinner at 5:00.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.765
And I'm not shaving your neck.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.644
- It's packed in there, son.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.189
You got standing room only.
- As he should.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.399
The mayor's coming, and he's
gonna have to answer to me.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.693
- No, Stamps.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.069
{\an3}He's coming to address
the congregation.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.571
{\an3}Don't talk to him.
I mean it.

13:00.654 --> 13:02.490
No, not one word.

13:02.573 --> 13:05.201
I just thought of another
question for the mayor.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.619
Shirley, you got a pen?

13:06.702 --> 13:10.289
Oh, Lord.
Shirley.

13:10.372 --> 13:14.126
- You don't know my struggle.

13:14.210 --> 13:18.047
- Boyce, a town car just pulled
up outside in the parking lot.

13:18.130 --> 13:21.217
- Oh, good.
All right, guys, it's show time.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.552
- Baby, I am so proud of you.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.221
I mean, you demanded respect,

13:25.304 --> 13:28.098
{\an3}and you got a meeting
with the mayor.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.975
- Knock knock?

13:30.059 --> 13:31.685
- Hey, you're not the mayor.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.604
- No, I'm Nick Peters
from Mayor Saxby's office.

13:33.687 --> 13:36.398
- And where is Mayor Saxby?

13:36.482 --> 13:38.567
- Well, uh, Mayor Saxby
sends his regrets.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.902
- So he's blowing us off.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.821
{\an3}- No, this meeting is a priority
for the mayor.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.448
{\an3}And he just respects you
too much to come

13:44.532 --> 13:46.408
{\an3}if he can't give the matter
his full attention.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.827
- Oh, so he's blowing us off
as a favor.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.372
- You could say that, yeah!

13:51.455 --> 13:52.456
And I have good news.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.291
{\an1}The mayor has reviewed
your brother's case

13:54.375 --> 13:57.044
{\an1}and agreed to waive all fines
and return his license.

13:57.127 --> 13:59.922
{\an3}- Ah, I knew
I liked you, Nick.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.258
{\an1}- Hold on.
We didn't ask for a bribe.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.718
{\an3}- Didn't ask for it,
but we're not mad at it.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.512
- You don't get it, do you?

14:06.595 --> 14:07.763
This isn't about one guy.

14:07.846 --> 14:10.099
{\an1}This about a mayor
who doesn't give a damn

14:10.182 --> 14:12.101
{\an1}about the very people
who elected him,

14:12.184 --> 14:15.145
including the 300 people
sitting in the sanctuary

14:15.229 --> 14:18.607
{\an1}who Mayor Saxby
respects too much to face.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.443
{\an1}- How old are you anyway?
12?

14:21.527 --> 14:24.446
{\an1}Does your mama even know
you're here?

14:24.530 --> 14:26.323
- Uh, she does.

14:26.407 --> 14:29.118
{\an3}I'm the assistant director
of community outreach.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.161
{\an3}I've got, like,
500 business cards.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.289
{\an1}- You know what?
You can keep your cards.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.000
{\an1}And you can tell Mayor Saxby
he can keep his bribe.

14:36.083 --> 14:39.962
{\an3}- Or we--we can really
teach him a lesson

14:40.045 --> 14:41.297
by taking the bribe

14:41.380 --> 14:44.174
{\an3}and telling him
to kiss our butts.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.759
- We're done here.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.345
{\an3}- Can I leave some campaign
buttons or, uh, bumper stickers?

14:48.429 --> 14:50.681
{\an1}- Get out!

14:50.764 --> 14:52.975
{\an3}- You know what, bro?
I don't know what's worse.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.476
That you just did that,

14:54.560 --> 14:56.186
{\an3}or that everyone's gonna
tell you how great it was.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.480
- It was so great, Boyce.
- It sure was.

14:58.564 --> 14:59.940
- I'm proud of you, son.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.358
- Oh, come on.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.360
{\an3}I'm gonna be the one to have
to get a second job now.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.529
{\an1}- You know what?
I'm done with Saxby.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.448
This city needs
to elect a mayor,

15:07.531 --> 15:09.491
somebody who will fight
for the little guy.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.910
You know, the people
that make this city great.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.621
He's got to be out there
somewhere.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.332
- Son, I think you should take
a page from your own sermon.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.959
You've been telling your
congregation to get involved,

15:19.043 --> 15:20.252
take some action.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.504
I think you should practice
what you preach.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.381
- Seriously, Dad?

15:24.465 --> 15:27.176
Me, run for Mayor?

15:27.259 --> 15:29.970
{\an1}- I think that is a great idea,
Barton.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.263
- Okay, see--

15:31.347 --> 15:32.640
{\an3}- I don't see any reason
why I shouldn't.

15:32.723 --> 15:35.392
You know, why not me?

15:35.476 --> 15:37.645
- Why not you?

15:37.728 --> 15:39.313
{\an3}- I am a pillar
of the community.

15:39.396 --> 15:41.523
- A pillar!

15:41.607 --> 15:43.025
- My face is already out there.

15:43.108 --> 15:46.028
{\an1}- Face. Boom.
Everywhere.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.447
{\an3}- And I know
what this city needs.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.074
- Feed the need, Boyce!

15:50.157 --> 15:51.700
- I meant you should start
a petition

15:51.784 --> 15:54.078
or maybe go to the news.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.789
{\an3}- No, no, no, you were right
the first time, Daddy.

15:56.872 --> 16:00.042
{\an3}You know, it is time to
take some serious action here.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.919
{\an3}All right, the congregation
is sitting out there

16:02.002 --> 16:04.755
{\an3}waiting to hear from the mayor,
but instead,

16:04.838 --> 16:06.632
they are gonna hear
from the next mayor.

16:06.715 --> 16:08.967
I'm gonna do it.

16:09.051 --> 16:09.593
{\an3}Come on, baby, let's go tell
the congregation.

16:09.677 --> 16:13.013
{\an1}- Oh, me too?
Oh!

16:14.014 --> 16:16.266
- Say, uh, Pop,

16:16.350 --> 16:18.686
think you can spot me $250?

16:18.769 --> 16:19.436
- Oh, let me think about it.

16:19.520 --> 16:23.148
{\an3}No.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.067
{\an3}- Shirley, how much do you get
for that Splenda?

16:25.150 --> 16:29.029
{\an1}- I better not catch you
on my block, sucker.

16:34.785 --> 16:36.412
- Babe, that was amazing.

16:36.495 --> 16:40.040
{\an3}- Boyce, that congregation was
eatin' you up with a spoon.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.417
- Yeah, you know,

16:41.500 --> 16:44.420
{\an1}I wish they got that excited
when I talked about Jesus.

16:44.503 --> 16:48.340
{\an1}And that ain't on you, Lord,
that's all on me.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.884
- Boyce, I'm so proud of you.

16:50.968 --> 16:53.595
{\an1}- Look how many people signed up
to work on my campaign.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.560
{\an3}- Boyce, I'm not gonna lie.
I can't see that.

16:59.643 --> 17:00.728
- Well, you know
what would help,

17:00.811 --> 17:02.020
if you put on your glasses.

17:02.104 --> 17:06.108
{\an3}- Nuh-uh, you are never seeing
me in those ugly things.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.694
{\an1}- So you just never gonna
read again?

17:08.777 --> 17:11.280
{\an3}- Stamps never reads
and he's happy.

17:11.363 --> 17:14.407
- Lolli.
- Fine.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.201
Okay, Boyce.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.328
{\an3}We had a good run,
me and you.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.247
Mm-hmm, right now,

17:20.329 --> 17:22.415
we are about to pour cold water

17:22.499 --> 17:25.377
on the fire of our marriage.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.463
Once I put these glasses on,

17:27.546 --> 17:30.340
the nasty's over.

17:33.135 --> 17:36.054
{\an1}- Say, what's up?
Say, hello!

17:36.138 --> 17:37.931
What's the matter?

17:38.015 --> 17:40.350
Yeah!
- Really?

17:40.434 --> 17:42.311
{\an3}Boyce, stop it.
Just stop.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.646
{\an1}- I like that.
Look.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.691
{\an1}Lolli, you remind me of
my sixth grade Spanish teacher,

17:47.775 --> 17:49.985
Mrs. Guzman.

17:50.068 --> 17:53.155
{\an1}Ah, she had the long hair,
and she had those glasses on.

17:53.238 --> 17:56.575
{\an1}And she would look at me
and she'd be, "Boythe, Boythe."

17:56.658 --> 17:58.994
{\an1}It got me through.
Come on, come, put 'em back on.

17:59.077 --> 18:02.831
Put 'em back on.
- Are you sure?

18:02.915 --> 18:05.584
- Ooh, muy caliente!

18:05.667 --> 18:06.835
[scatting Latin melody]

18:06.919 --> 18:09.880
- Aah!
Boyce!

18:09.963 --> 18:11.590
Okay, Boyce, okay.

18:13.425 --> 18:16.595
{\an1}you know, well, you know,

18:16.678 --> 18:20.015

18:36.615 --> 18:37.866
This is my wife, Lolli.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.618
And I'm officially running
for mayor.

18:39.701 --> 18:43.288
I have the signatures of 1,000
of my fellow citizens.

18:43.372 --> 18:46.208
And I have a plan
to revitalize this city.

18:46.291 --> 18:49.837
I have message of hope
for all of St. Louis.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.757

uh, is it EG?

18:56.844 --> 19:00.389
Yeah, we have that.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.808
{\an3}- It's not notarized.
You have to go to three.

19:02.891 --> 19:05.519

to revitalize this city.

19:05.602 --> 19:09.022
And I have a message of hope

19:09.106 --> 19:10.440

19:10.524 --> 19:12.401
{\an3}is that you have
a driver's license and a thumb.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.194
Don't be shy.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.697
- Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, ah!

19:16.780 --> 19:17.781
- Your fingers are pretty meaty.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.200
- Give me my finger.
Give me my thumb.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.660

19:32.379 --> 19:34.089
- I told you I was gonna
have to get another job

19:34.173 --> 19:35.257
to pay for my ticket.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.967
Let me see what you got.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.553
{\an3}Oh, you smudged some ink
in the "do not write here" box.

19:39.636 --> 19:42.931
{\an3}You're gonna have to get
a waiver on two.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.433
- Stamps, let me--

19:44.516 --> 19:46.310
