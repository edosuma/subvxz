00:00.619 --> 00:04.632
Justice for Katherine,
justice for women!

00:06.880 --> 00:09.720
Here to help save an innocent
woman from the scaffold?

00:10.166 --> 00:12.905
I believe that only God should have
the power to take a life,

00:12.920 --> 00:14.960
but I can assure you
that Katherine Corven

00:15.000 --> 00:16.160
is far from innocent.

00:16.160 --> 00:17.880
Don't tell me you're gullible enough

00:17.880 --> 00:19.920
to believe the police's
version of events?

00:19.960 --> 00:23.238
I was there when she was arrested.
I have no doubt about her guilt.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.240
But it seems, finally,

00:26.280 --> 00:28.840
she has decided to seek
the forgiveness of God.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.360
I should've known.

00:31.360 --> 00:34.320
Another pawn in the male conspiracy
to kill a strong-minded woman.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.280
Shame on you! Shame on you!

00:39.160 --> 00:40.520
Excuse me.

00:42.640 --> 00:43.600
Justice for Katherine!

00:43.640 --> 00:47.480
All I know is she wants
to make a confession.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.920
Is the prison chaplain
not available?

00:49.920 --> 00:52.160
She asked for you by name.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.400
Said she wouldn't speak
to anybody else.

00:54.400 --> 00:57.440
Do you believe
she is truly repentant?

00:57.480 --> 00:59.520
HE CHUCKLES

00:59.520 --> 01:03.360
George will be outside,
so shout if you need him.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.959
Thank you.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.960
A word of advice, Father.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.320
Don't turn your back on her.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.600
Not for a second.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.360
Katherine. Father.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.560
So lovely to see you again.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.080
I wasn't sure if you'd come.

01:39.480 --> 01:42.520
I understand you're ready
to confess your sins to God.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.120
Oh, absolutely. I can't wait.

01:49.840 --> 01:54.120
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

01:56.560 --> 01:59.000
It's been years since
my last confession.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.560
What I tell you won't go
any further, will it?

02:01.560 --> 02:04.840
Whatever you say is between
you, me, and Almighty God.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.320
Wonderful. That's what I thought.

02:11.160 --> 02:14.000
The Seal of the Confessional
cannot be broken.

02:14.040 --> 02:17.240
So, if you truly wish to confess,
leave nothing out.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.880
The affair, your husband's murder...

02:20.920 --> 02:22.000
While there's nobody

02:22.040 --> 02:24.560
I'd sooner share my darkest secrets
with, Father,

02:24.600 --> 02:26.560
I've told you before,

02:26.600 --> 02:29.400
my poor Bertie died of
a completely natural heart attack.

02:31.320 --> 02:32.960
Then why have you summoned me?

02:34.840 --> 02:37.160
I wanted to get something
off my chest.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.600
You see...

02:40.400 --> 02:42.920
..I've just arranged
the death of my lover.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.680
You remember Raymond, don't you?

02:45.720 --> 02:49.000
Tell me, was that terribly naughty?

03:32.440 --> 03:35.440
Knick-knacks for the tombola
this weekend.

03:35.480 --> 03:37.480
What's wrong? Nothing.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.960
Why are you holding
a letter behind your back then?

03:40.960 --> 03:42.400
I'm not.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.200
Let me see it.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.640
This is no concern of yours.

03:47.880 --> 03:51.120
How dare you?!
Just give that back this instant!

03:51.160 --> 03:55.400
"Prepare yourself, Father. For soon
your flock will learn the truth. R."

03:56.880 --> 04:00.520
Who sent this?
I can't begin to imagine.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.440
What did Father Brown say?

04:02.480 --> 04:04.920
I haven't showed it to him yet.

04:04.920 --> 04:07.960
Why not?! Well, he's just
not himself today.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.440
Do you remember that
Katherine Corven woman?

04:11.440 --> 04:15.280
The Black Widow? Who could forget?

04:15.280 --> 04:17.959
Even the broadsheets went gaga
for her trial.

04:17.959 --> 04:21.560
Father Brown cracked the case,
didn't he? Yes, he did.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.200
And today he went to visit her
in prison.

04:24.240 --> 04:28.440
It probably dredged up
some bad memories for him.

04:28.480 --> 04:31.800
Anyway, this letter is just
some foolish prank.

04:31.840 --> 04:35.200
Be that as it may, if someone is
sending this vile nonsense to him,

04:35.200 --> 04:37.640
he should know about it. Maybe so.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.160
DOOR OPENS

04:39.160 --> 04:40.480
Father!

04:45.640 --> 04:48.600
Ah, Bunty, how are you?

04:48.600 --> 04:50.200
Just peachy, thanks, Father.

04:50.240 --> 04:53.600
Um, Mrs M has something
she'd like to discuss with you.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.680
There's someone I need to visit.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.400
Can it wait till I get back?

04:58.400 --> 05:01.520
Father, whatever is the matter?
You look quite pale.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.000
He has a right to know.

05:36.560 --> 05:39.160
GUNSHOT

05:55.480 --> 05:57.880
Raymond? I thought I told you to...

05:59.280 --> 06:01.160
Don't shoot! Forgive me, Father.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.920
I thought you were one of
those blasted journalists.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.240
I'm rather glad I'm not.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.840
I heard the shot.

06:09.800 --> 06:10.840
What happened?

06:11.800 --> 06:12.880
That?

06:13.920 --> 06:16.840
I was scaring off a bird of prey.
An eagle, I think.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.320
It was circling over my chickens.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.720
I'm sorry if I alarmed you.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.680
It's good to see you. Likewise.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.560
I'm sorry we didn't get a chance
to talk after the trial.

06:27.560 --> 06:31.160
I thought it best to make myself
scarce before the mob descended.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.400
Very wise.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.840
So...to what do I owe the pleasure?

06:39.120 --> 06:41.320
I just wondered how you were.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.160
In that case,
how about I put the kettle on?

06:57.800 --> 06:59.160
There you are.

07:01.640 --> 07:05.080
So, you've decided to move on.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.400
As far away from Kembleford
as possible.

07:08.440 --> 07:11.800
I'm sick of the press hounding me,
the voyeurs snooping around,

07:11.800 --> 07:15.000
hoping to catch a glimpse of
Katherine Corven's lover.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.680
That must be difficult.

07:16.680 --> 07:19.720
I still get spat at in the street
by people who think

07:19.720 --> 07:21.720
I was involved in
her husband's murder.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.640
And then there are the letters.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.200
Letters?

07:26.240 --> 07:29.240
From Katherine, trying
to convince me of her innocence.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.680
Begging me to visit her.

07:31.920 --> 07:32.840
And have you?

07:32.840 --> 07:36.600
Once, recently,
to tell her I was going away.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.560
She got angry, so I left.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.320
Why did you really come here?

07:45.320 --> 07:47.760
I was concerned about you.

07:47.760 --> 07:51.600
I assume you lock your door, with
all these people snooping around?

07:53.240 --> 07:56.040
Don't worry about me, Father.
I'll soon be long gone.

07:57.920 --> 08:01.520
Actually, I'm glad you're here.
I'd like to ask a favour.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.080
Wait there.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.200
Take it.

08:23.920 --> 08:27.760
I'll be honest with you, Father,
I don't trust myself with it.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.280
I will put it somewhere safe.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.600
Thank you.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.280
One other thing...

08:35.320 --> 08:37.200
My spare key to the cottage.

08:37.240 --> 08:38.960
With all the press lurking around,

08:38.960 --> 08:41.799
I'd sooner not leave it
under a flowerpot.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.680
Will you do me something in return?

08:46.160 --> 08:47.480
Name it.

08:47.480 --> 08:49.920
Please will you take care
of yourself?

08:52.360 --> 08:53.760
I intend to.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.240
Sorry to bother you, Inspector.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.720
What have I told you,
Sergeant? Knock!

09:02.720 --> 09:04.320
Sorry, sir.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.200
Well, it's a bit late now!

09:06.200 --> 09:07.560
Well?

09:07.600 --> 09:09.200
Gunshot reported near Frimley Copse.

09:09.240 --> 09:12.480
Probably a farmer
firing at a troublesome pest.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.440
Thing is, sir,

09:15.480 --> 09:18.760
the witness reported the gunshot
came from Raymond Worrall's cottage.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.760
And?

09:20.800 --> 09:24.280
Seeing as Worrall was involved
in that Katherine Corven case,

09:24.280 --> 09:27.080
I thought maybe...
They were right, you know.

09:29.840 --> 09:32.560
A policeman's lot
is not a happy one.

09:40.880 --> 09:41.920
Inspector.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.920
Padre. Looks like you need
a celestial chariot

09:44.960 --> 09:47.600
to descend from Heaven
and give you a tow.

09:47.600 --> 09:51.480
Sergeant. Father.
Where're you off to, anyway?

09:51.480 --> 09:54.000
Thought you normally cycled
TOWARDS gunshots.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.120
Gunshots?

09:56.160 --> 09:57.800
Oh, that was nothing.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.720
What's that?

10:01.720 --> 10:04.680
It's something I've been given
to look after.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.280
For a member of my flock.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.960
Don't suppose it was
Raymond Worrall?

10:08.960 --> 10:11.960
We believe the gunshot came
from his property.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.360
He was scaring an eagle.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.800
An eagle?

10:15.840 --> 10:16.840
That's what he said.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.920
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm wanted in Kembleford.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.240
Shall we head back
to the station now, sir?

10:31.480 --> 10:32.440
Not yet.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.080
ENGINE STARTS

10:48.760 --> 10:50.240
Try round the back.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.360
Righty-o, sir.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.120
Wait!

11:01.160 --> 11:02.080
Sir?

11:06.440 --> 11:08.040
Funny-looking eagle.

11:09.680 --> 11:13.120
KNOCKING ON DOOR

11:13.120 --> 11:15.320
DOOR OPENS
Where is he?

11:15.360 --> 11:18.480
Inspector, this is most improper!

11:18.520 --> 11:21.680
Know what's even more improper?
Having a hole in your skull!

11:21.680 --> 11:22.760
Inspector?

11:22.760 --> 11:25.920
Why exactly did you go to see
Mr Worrall earlier?

11:25.920 --> 11:27.120
I can't tell you.

11:27.160 --> 11:30.840
You can't remember something
that happened an hour ago?

11:30.880 --> 11:32.600
No, I can't tell you.

11:33.880 --> 11:37.240
You certainly can.
I'm an officer of the law!

11:37.240 --> 11:39.120
I believe Father Brown's referring

11:39.160 --> 11:40.960
to the Seal of the Confessional,
sir.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.640
I don't care if he's referring
to the walrus at Chester Zoo!

11:43.640 --> 11:45.440
A man is dead!

11:45.480 --> 11:46.840
Who?

11:46.840 --> 11:50.320
Raymond Worrall,
your eagle-bothering chum.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.120
He was shot in the head
from close range.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.960
So you'll have to do better than
"I can't tell you".

11:58.000 --> 12:01.440
There was no weapon found
with Mr Worrall's body.

12:01.480 --> 12:04.480
The doors and windows
were all locked,

12:04.520 --> 12:09.160
so whoever did it must've taken
the gun and the key with them.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.760
Where's that box?

12:32.760 --> 12:34.720
What have we got here?

12:41.280 --> 12:43.080
It's recently been fired.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.120
As I told you, he...

12:44.160 --> 12:45.720
The eagle, yes.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.400
One shot fired.

12:50.440 --> 12:51.440
I'll be honest, Padre,

12:51.440 --> 12:54.040
if it were anyone else,
you'd already be in cuffs.

13:08.640 --> 13:13.440
"Prepare yourself, Father, for soon
your flock will learn the truth. R."

13:13.480 --> 13:15.800
I'm guessing the R
stands for Raymond?

13:15.800 --> 13:18.040
I've never seen that letter
before in my life.

13:18.080 --> 13:21.120
That is true.
It came first thing this morning.

13:21.120 --> 13:24.680
I opened it, I read it
and then I threw it away.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.245
Is that right?

13:26.270 --> 13:28.800
It sounds to me like you wanted
Mr Worrall to keep his mouth

13:28.840 --> 13:30.040
shut about something.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.240
Is that why you went to his cottage?

13:32.280 --> 13:33.480
As I said, I...

13:33.480 --> 13:34.480
I've had enough of this.

13:34.520 --> 13:38.600
Father Brown, you're under arrest
on suspicion of murder.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.880
Inspector!
Sir, are you sure about this?

13:41.920 --> 13:44.000
You're not obliged to say anything,

13:44.040 --> 13:46.240
but apparently
you already know that.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.160
Your lunch, Mrs Corven.

13:54.320 --> 13:56.400
Not in the mood for chicken today.

13:56.440 --> 13:58.440
Tell the cook to make me
an omelette.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.560
But... Problem?

14:01.120 --> 14:02.640
No, Mrs Corven.

14:04.160 --> 14:07.040
Good. I don't have many days left.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.600
I'd hate to waste them
destroying you.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.000
I have bigger fish to fry.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.080
I'll go and ask Cook straight away.

14:29.320 --> 14:33.800
I assure you, Raymond Worrall's
death was none of my doing.

14:33.800 --> 14:37.520
You assure me?
Well, that's all right, then!

14:37.560 --> 14:41.520
No need to bother collecting
evidence, interviewing witnesses.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.560
If you let me go,
I can find out what happened.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.280
And how are you planning to do that?

14:48.320 --> 14:50.480
I have certain information.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.560
What information?

14:55.560 --> 14:56.720
I'm afraid...

14:57.800 --> 15:00.200
You can't tell me? What a surprise!

15:00.200 --> 15:02.240
Sorry, Padre,
but if you want out of here,

15:02.240 --> 15:05.360
you're going to have to be
a little more forthcoming.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.880
How about I leave you alone
to think about that?

15:14.560 --> 15:16.040
Is the inspector in?

15:16.080 --> 15:19.080
Of all the ridiculous things
you've done, Inspector,

15:19.120 --> 15:21.080
this really takes the biscuit!
Here we go!

15:21.120 --> 15:24.800
How could you be so stupid
as to believe that Father Brown

15:24.800 --> 15:26.120
could murder anyone?

15:26.160 --> 15:28.440
He can't even kill the slugs
in his own garden!

15:28.480 --> 15:31.000
Ladies, while I appreciate you
coming here to tell me how to

15:31.000 --> 15:36.120
do my job, I have concrete evidence
of Father Brown's involvement.

15:36.160 --> 15:39.240
He had the murder weapon in his
possession, for goodness' sake!

15:39.240 --> 15:40.520
It wasn't him.

15:40.560 --> 15:45.080
And you can't just fling him into
a cell like a common criminal.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.320
I think you'll find I can.

15:47.360 --> 15:50.960
Can't we come to some arrangement?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.840
I don't know what you're implying.

15:54.080 --> 16:02.160
How about you let Father Brown go
and I don't call my uncle at

16:02.160 --> 16:05.680
the Home Office and get you a new
job directing traffic in Coventry?

16:05.680 --> 16:10.880
Threats or no threats,
Father Brown is staying put!

16:12.520 --> 16:15.520
I never want any of that!
I'm just a respectable fella,

16:15.520 --> 16:17.760
trying to keep going
with his little operation.

16:17.800 --> 16:18.800
What's he done now?

16:18.840 --> 16:21.880
Stole a bicycle from outside
Mr Botham's cottage.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.760
I thought it had been left out
for scrap.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.360
Put him in cell two.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.720
An innocent misunderstanding...

16:27.760 --> 16:29.040
There you go, ladies.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.800
The Padre will have someone
to keep him company.

16:31.840 --> 16:32.760
Oh!

16:39.640 --> 16:43.960
He's coming now.
Father, I wanted to say that...

16:45.960 --> 16:46.960
No need.

16:47.849 --> 16:49.419
I'm sure it'll get ironed out.

16:55.840 --> 16:59.000
I'll admit it, I'm surprised.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.720
Not much shocks me, but this is
a right old turn-up for the books.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.079
We've retrieved
a bullet from the body.

17:09.119 --> 17:12.440
It matches the calibre of revolver
that you had in your possession -

17:12.480 --> 17:14.839
a revolver that was recently fired.

17:14.880 --> 17:17.920
We've searched the house,
but there's no other weapon.

17:17.960 --> 17:21.400
Furthermore, Mr Worrall was
discovered in a locked house,

17:21.400 --> 17:26.000
but there's no other key was found
on the body or during the search.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.760
Then maybe the murderer
took it with them?

17:28.800 --> 17:30.720
My thoughts exactly.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.240
And then there's this.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.080
A letter from the victim,

17:43.120 --> 17:47.000
threatening to expose
some grubby little secret.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.200
So what did you do, Padre?

17:49.440 --> 17:53.280
Get too friendly with one
of your parishioners?

17:53.280 --> 17:54.880
Embezzle money from the church?

17:57.440 --> 17:59.560
My conscience is clear.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.200
That won't help you in court.

18:02.240 --> 18:09.120
You see, we have method, motive and
opportunity here - the Holy Trinity.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.480
So, for the last time,

18:13.480 --> 18:18.480
can you please explain what you were
doing in Raymond Worrall's cottage?

18:23.120 --> 18:25.360
I'll give you the night
to think about it.

18:25.400 --> 18:30.240
In the morning, either you tell me
everything you know,

18:30.240 --> 18:32.120
or I charge you with murder.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.600
DOOR OPENS

18:40.440 --> 18:41.600
Any news?

18:41.640 --> 18:45.440
Nothing. This is all my fault.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.640
If I had told him about
the letter...

18:47.640 --> 18:50.920
You did what you thought was best.
SHE SIGHS

18:50.920 --> 18:53.200
Why do you think
he went down to that cottage?

18:53.200 --> 18:55.000
He didn't say.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.040
But he's been out of sorts
ever since

18:57.080 --> 19:00.880
he came back from seeing
that terrible Corven woman.

19:00.920 --> 19:03.360
Raymond Worrall was her lover.

19:03.360 --> 19:07.400
So, more than likely,
she has something to do with it.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.040
Well, I hate to put
a dampener on things,

19:09.040 --> 19:12.280
but isn't Katherine Corven
very much behind bars?

19:12.320 --> 19:15.120
It's not like they'd let her nip out
to shoot someone.

19:15.160 --> 19:18.760
But what if she got someone else
to do it for her?

19:18.800 --> 19:22.000
Maybe a cellmate
due for release or...

19:22.040 --> 19:24.880
If only we could get in
and talk to her.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.760
Why can't we?

19:26.760 --> 19:29.760
One can't simply saunter
into a prison.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.360
I don't see why not.

19:31.400 --> 19:35.040
After all, my godfather is
chairman of the Board of Governors.

19:35.080 --> 19:38.280
Is there any institution in
this country that is not run by

19:38.320 --> 19:40.280
one of your relatives?

19:40.280 --> 19:41.320
Not that I can think of.

19:42.680 --> 19:48.440
Impossible!
Mrs Corven is awaiting execution.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.280
She's being held
under the strictest conditions.

19:52.720 --> 19:53.880
My godfather assured us...

19:53.920 --> 19:57.720
Your godfather should know
the rules.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.200
Very well.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.520
I will file a report which states
that your prison breaches

20:03.520 --> 20:07.720
the 1948 Criminal Justice Act,
section 23C.

20:07.760 --> 20:08.760
Excuse me?

20:10.080 --> 20:13.840
It states that every prisoner
has the right to meet in private

20:13.840 --> 20:17.280
with a spiritual advisor
or representatives thereof.

20:17.320 --> 20:21.120
You are spiritual advisors?

20:21.160 --> 20:23.040
Representatives thereof.

20:23.080 --> 20:27.880
We were sent by Father Brown.
He is...currently indisposed.

20:35.400 --> 20:39.600
This is an unexpected treat.
Friends of Father Brown, I hear?

20:39.640 --> 20:41.040
How is he?

20:41.080 --> 20:43.600
He's in a prison cell,
as I'm sure you know.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.880
Excellent!

20:44.880 --> 20:46.880
What did you say to him yesterday?

20:46.880 --> 20:48.720
That's private, I'm afraid.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.600
Oh, we'll find out one way
or another.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.400
No, you won't.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.040
Only two of us know what was said,

20:54.080 --> 20:55.800
and Father Brown
isn't allowed to tell.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.280
His god won't let him.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.760
Such a tragedy -
destroyed by his own faith.

20:59.760 --> 21:02.160
If you don't put an end to this,
young lady...

21:02.200 --> 21:03.720
You'll do what?

21:03.720 --> 21:07.240
I'm being executed in a few days,
thanks to our mutual friend.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.320
What exactly have I left to lose?

21:09.320 --> 21:13.080
We'll prove that Father Brown had
nothing to do with Raymond's death.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.440
I doubt it.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.960
But I'd hate for your journey to be
a complete waste,

21:16.960 --> 21:19.000
so would you pass on
a message from me?

21:19.000 --> 21:21.480
Tell Father Brown that
I'll see him in hell.

21:32.880 --> 21:35.680
Katherine must have recruited
someone to murder Raymond and

21:35.720 --> 21:37.240
frame Father Brown.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.800
All we have to do is find out who.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.920
I wonder what they got in return.
Ahem!

21:43.146 --> 21:44.310
Follow my lead.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.520
You survived, I see?

21:49.520 --> 21:52.560
Yes. And we know what
Katherine's been up to.

21:55.520 --> 21:56.600
I'll show them out.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.080
What do you mean?

22:01.120 --> 22:03.000
You know exactly what I mean.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.720
She told us everything.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.360
She made a deal.

22:08.240 --> 22:11.200
Please. Don't tell the governor.

22:14.720 --> 22:17.120
If you want to keep your job,

22:17.160 --> 22:20.120
you are going to tell us
your side of the story.

22:20.120 --> 22:21.760
And don't leave anything out.

22:23.880 --> 22:27.480
Katherine found out
about the affair.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.760
Relationships between the officers
is strictly forbidden.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.960
And of course George is married.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.960
So she blackmailed you?

22:35.960 --> 22:39.680
She told me she'd keep her mouth
shut in return for certain

22:39.680 --> 22:44.600
favours - special meals,
privileges...

22:44.640 --> 22:46.840
and the letters. Go on.

22:49.240 --> 22:54.720
All correspondence is supposed to go
via the governor's office,

22:54.720 --> 22:57.120
but I'd sneak them out.

22:57.160 --> 22:59.640
At first, they were just letters
to her lover,

22:59.680 --> 23:01.560
Raymond or whatever he's called.

23:03.080 --> 23:06.280
I think Katherine was trying to get
back into his affections.

23:07.520 --> 23:13.000
Then they tailed off, and other
notes were going back and forth.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.840
Other notes? To whom?

23:14.840 --> 23:17.120
DISTANT: We demand justice!
Set Katherine free!

23:17.160 --> 23:20.680
We demand justice!
Set Katherine free...

23:20.720 --> 23:22.480
Her?

23:22.480 --> 23:24.840
What were these notes about?

23:24.880 --> 23:26.560
I don't know.

23:26.560 --> 23:29.840
Honestly. I never opened them.
That was part of the deal.

23:29.880 --> 23:33.560
Please. It was just a few letters.

23:34.920 --> 23:38.200
No. I think it was much more
than that.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.360
DISTANT: Set Katherine free!
We demand justice...

23:41.600 --> 23:46.240
Something to keep you going, Father.
Don't tell the inspector, though.

23:46.240 --> 23:49.360
He thinks you'd be more cooperative
on an empty stomach.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.960
It is much appreciated.

23:53.240 --> 23:57.040
Look, Father, I know you wouldn't
kill anybody and

23:57.080 --> 24:00.520
so does the inspector, he's just
being too pig-headed to admit it.

24:00.560 --> 24:03.720
Is there anything I can do to help?

24:03.760 --> 24:05.400
That's very kind of you, Sergeant.

24:05.440 --> 24:09.400
But I wouldn't want to get
you into trouble.

24:09.440 --> 24:12.320
And when has a bit of trouble ever
stopped you from helping others?

24:12.320 --> 24:15.760
Well, if you really want to help,

24:15.800 --> 24:19.000
perhaps you could tell me who it was
who alerted the police to

24:19.040 --> 24:21.600
the gunshot at
Raymond Worrall's cottage.

24:22.880 --> 24:26.320
It was a young lady, but she
wouldn't give her name. Sorry.

24:26.360 --> 24:29.360
Said she was calling from the public
telephone on Ridley Street,

24:29.400 --> 24:30.480
if that's any help?

24:30.520 --> 24:32.640
Yes. It is, thank you.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.840
Anything else? No.

24:34.880 --> 24:40.120
Yes. Erm...could you fetch me
a piece of chalk, please?

24:42.000 --> 24:46.240
Justice for Katherine Corven!
Justice for women!

24:46.240 --> 24:48.520
Justice for Katherine Corven!

24:48.520 --> 24:49.680
You!

24:51.160 --> 24:53.588
Guilty conscience?

24:53.619 --> 24:55.019
Why should I have?

24:55.044 --> 24:56.160
One man is dead.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.840
And another man is in a police cell
for a crime he didn't commit.

24:59.840 --> 25:02.880
And a woman is due to be hanged
for defending herself against

25:02.880 --> 25:04.080
a husband's tyranny.

25:04.120 --> 25:07.240
Oh, we know Katherine Corven has
been feeding you her lies. Lies?

25:07.280 --> 25:09.960
She killed her husband
and now she's killed Raymond.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.240
Or at least got someone else
to do it for her.

25:12.240 --> 25:14.520
You don't know
what you're talking about.

25:14.560 --> 25:17.520
Katherine had nothing to do with
Raymond's death! She loved him.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.120
She was trying to protect him.

25:19.160 --> 25:20.960
Protect him? From whom?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.360
She wouldn't tell me.
She said it would put me in danger.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.280
But someone intended to hurt
Raymond,

25:25.320 --> 25:29.080
and she asked me to watch
the cottage that morning.

25:29.120 --> 25:32.000
If anything happened, I was to call
the police immediately.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.160
So what did happen?

25:33.160 --> 25:36.200
I heard a gunshot, so I ran
to the nearest telephone box.

25:36.240 --> 25:39.640
Did you see anyone else near
the cottage? Anyone at all.

25:39.680 --> 25:43.040
No. Well except that
rag-and-bone man.

25:43.080 --> 25:46.040
The one who lives in the old barn
on Fletcher's Lane.

25:46.080 --> 25:49.200
He was pushing his barrow
towards Kembleford.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.680
But what could he have
against Mr Worrall?

25:51.720 --> 25:54.640
You're wasting your time.
Father Brown did it.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.680
Katherine warned me about him.

25:56.720 --> 25:59.520
Said he's a corrupt, evil,
selfish...

25:59.520 --> 26:01.800
Father Brown is the best man
I have ever met.

26:01.840 --> 26:04.240
And if you say one more word against
him, I will take your silly

26:04.280 --> 26:08.040
little sign and insert it into a
place where no-one can read it. Huh!

26:13.640 --> 26:16.200
DISTANT VOICE

26:42.240 --> 26:43.840
Are you there, Father?

26:45.360 --> 26:46.440
Yes.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.480
Do you believe in luck?

26:50.760 --> 26:52.160
I believe in God.

26:52.200 --> 26:55.640
Maybe that's what you want
to call it.

26:55.640 --> 26:58.560
I believe in Lady Luck.

27:00.160 --> 27:04.760
To look at me, most people wouldn't
think I'm a fortunate fellow,

27:04.800 --> 27:06.200
but I am.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.800
I am free, see.

27:08.840 --> 27:10.640
Even in here.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.640
Take this morning.

27:12.680 --> 27:17.320
I'd just finished my last bottle
when fate provided.

27:17.360 --> 27:18.800
DOOR OPENS

27:18.800 --> 27:21.200
Right. Time to go.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.640
See?
HE LAUGHS

27:23.680 --> 27:25.640
Lucky man, me!

27:26.920 --> 27:29.120
# Now my song is over

27:29.160 --> 27:31.440
# I've got no more to say

27:31.480 --> 27:34.000
# Just give me an egg and brandy

27:34.040 --> 27:36.960
♪ And I'll be on my way. ♪

27:36.960 --> 27:39.680
Ugh! What is that smell?

27:39.720 --> 27:41.480
I don't want to know.

27:47.960 --> 27:51.280
Do we even have any idea
what we are looking for?

27:51.320 --> 27:54.320
Something to link him
to Raymond, I suppose.

27:54.360 --> 27:56.960
In all this rubbish?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.360
It's like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

27:59.400 --> 28:00.680
Maybe you're right.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.760
No, wait. Look at this.

28:17.040 --> 28:20.120
So you want me to arrest him
for owning a photograph?

28:20.160 --> 28:22.360
Katherine Corven recruited someone

28:22.360 --> 28:25.000
to kill Raymond and frame
Father Brown.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.280
Harry Slow was seen in the area
at the time, and that photograph

28:28.280 --> 28:31.040
proves the connection between them.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.080
And what connection is that?

28:33.120 --> 28:36.360
We don't know!
That's why we've come to you.

28:36.400 --> 28:40.000
Sorry, but one photograph does not
a murder conviction make.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.640
Did you find a gun? A key?

28:42.680 --> 28:44.280
Any actual evidence?

28:45.880 --> 28:47.120
No, but...

28:47.160 --> 28:48.560
Where do you think you are going?!

28:48.600 --> 28:50.360
Dentist appointment. Toothache.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.840
And thanks to you two,
now I have earache as well!

28:52.840 --> 28:55.640
Can't you at least bring Harry
in for questioning?

28:55.680 --> 28:57.840
We've only just let him go!

29:01.800 --> 29:03.480
All right! I'll bring him in.

29:03.520 --> 29:07.400
But unless he has an identical
revolver, another key and the

29:07.440 --> 29:10.840
motive to use them, I fully intend
to charge the Padre with murder.

29:10.840 --> 29:13.280
Father Brown is no murderer!

29:13.280 --> 29:16.440
How many criminals
has he helped to put behind bars?

29:16.440 --> 29:18.560
Yes, I've been thinking
about that one.

29:18.560 --> 29:22.040
It's hard to know what came first,
the chicken or the egg.

29:22.080 --> 29:25.800
Was the Padre corrupted by his
exposure to so many murderers,

29:25.840 --> 29:28.360
or is his skill
at catching killers just

29:28.400 --> 29:30.600
a symptom of his own
homicidal instinct?

29:30.600 --> 29:32.840
For goodness' sake!

29:32.880 --> 29:34.240
Come on, this is useless.

29:34.280 --> 29:35.920
Goodbye, Inspector.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.720
Oh, and if finely-honed detective

29:39.760 --> 29:42.120
skills are a sign that somebody
might be

29:42.120 --> 29:46.600
a violent maniac, I'm sure none of
us has anything to fear from you.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.200
Right, sir.

29:57.440 --> 29:59.000
Sit yourself down.

29:59.040 --> 30:03.920
What happened? Missed me?
Where did you get this?

30:05.760 --> 30:07.440
Can't remember.

30:09.400 --> 30:13.600
Look, we normally turn a blind eye
to your "activities".

30:13.640 --> 30:15.880
Mostly because
whenever we bring you in,

30:15.920 --> 30:18.280
Goodfellow has to hose down the cell
afterwards.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.880
But if you want to end up in prison,
be my guest.

30:22.920 --> 30:27.280
No need for that, Inspector.
I think it's coming back to me.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.200
It's a miracle(!)

30:31.040 --> 30:33.160
I was walking into town

30:33.200 --> 30:37.600
first thing yesterday,
passing Frimley Copse,

30:37.640 --> 30:40.200
when I saw a man digging a hole.

30:40.240 --> 30:42.520
What did he look like?

30:42.520 --> 30:47.160
Oh, you know...average.
Average height, average build...

30:47.200 --> 30:51.240
I get the picture.
Why was he digging a hole?

30:51.280 --> 30:53.600
He was burying something.

30:53.600 --> 30:57.000
A wooden box.
Beautiful carved thing, it was.

30:58.080 --> 30:59.960
Anyway, he clearly didn't want it,

31:00.000 --> 31:03.160
so I waited for him to go
and then I dug it up.

31:03.200 --> 31:05.120
Where is it now?

31:05.160 --> 31:08.280
I sold it to the landlord
of the Red Lion.

31:08.320 --> 31:12.400
Paid off my tab and got a few bob
left over to top myself up again.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.000
Sergeant.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.040
I'll go and see if the landlord's
still got it, sir.

31:17.080 --> 31:20.160
So the photograph was inside?

31:20.200 --> 31:24.440
That and a few letters.
Did you read them?

31:24.480 --> 31:26.600
Never been my strong point, reading.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.080
Why keep the picture?

31:31.480 --> 31:32.880
Look at it.

31:36.880 --> 31:39.400
I can dream, can't I?

31:42.880 --> 31:46.640
DOOR OPENS

31:47.880 --> 31:51.440
I don't have long. The inspector
will wonder where I've got to.

31:51.480 --> 31:54.000
A man was seen burying it
in the woods yesterday morning.

31:54.040 --> 31:58.680
Judging from the initials,
I'm guessing it was Raymond Worrall.

31:58.720 --> 32:02.440
Or the murderer.
Maybe it's stolen from the house.

32:02.480 --> 32:05.240
These letters are from Katherine.
"Fear not, my love,

32:05.280 --> 32:07.080
"death cannot part us.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.480
"One day we shall be together
again."

32:10.920 --> 32:13.280
It sounds like they were still
a couple.

32:13.280 --> 32:16.480
Which is funny because Mrs McCarthy
reckons this Corven woman is

32:16.480 --> 32:18.160
the one that wanted him dead.

32:18.200 --> 32:23.040
So what changed to make Katherine
want to have Raymond murdered?

32:23.080 --> 32:26.800
Maybe he'd told her that
he was planning to move away and she

32:26.800 --> 32:28.760
felt abandoned?

32:28.760 --> 32:30.320
Possibly. Sergeant!

32:33.040 --> 32:34.560
Sergeant!

32:37.880 --> 32:39.920
What are you doing in here?

32:39.920 --> 32:41.520
Just checking on the inmate, sir.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.760
I heard a cry of pain.

32:43.800 --> 32:47.600
I just wanted to make sure
he wasn't doing himself a mischief.

32:50.720 --> 32:51.800
I stubbed my toe.

32:56.160 --> 33:00.040
This for our benefit?
Don't waste your time, Padre.

33:00.040 --> 33:03.640
We know you're guilty,
don't we, Sergeant?

33:03.680 --> 33:05.520
Seems that way, sir.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.120
Is that it?

33:08.160 --> 33:09.160
Yes, sir.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.080
Get all this cleaned up.

33:11.080 --> 33:12.800
And send that other
troublemaker home,

33:12.840 --> 33:14.720
and tell him to lay off the sauce.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.240
Right away, sir.

33:16.280 --> 33:18.520
I might be able to prove
my innocence,

33:18.520 --> 33:22.240
but only if I can get out of here.

33:22.280 --> 33:24.000
The inspector will never allow it.

33:25.760 --> 33:28.960
But...perhaps there's another way.

33:33.560 --> 33:36.360
Did you get rid of that drunkard
like I asked?

33:36.400 --> 33:38.400
I did. Yes, sir.

33:38.440 --> 33:39.440
Good.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.440
Sweet dreams, Padre.

33:53.480 --> 34:02.560
SNORING

34:04.120 --> 34:08.000
You can do what you like,
but I am going to gather the

34:08.000 --> 34:11.719
congregation and we will maintain
a vigil in front of that police

34:11.760 --> 34:14.400
station until Father Brown
has been released!

34:14.400 --> 34:17.600
They're not going to let him go
because a bunch of octogenarians

34:17.639 --> 34:21.280
are sat outside with a flask of tea
and cucumber sandwiches!

34:21.280 --> 34:24.199
Did you actually say octogenarians?!

34:24.199 --> 34:25.520
SHE MOUTHS

34:25.560 --> 34:27.199
FOOTSTEPS

34:28.400 --> 34:31.920
Nice to see you are both getting
along so well during my absence.

34:31.960 --> 34:33.480
Father!

34:33.520 --> 34:36.400
So, Inspector Mallory
finally saw sense?

34:36.400 --> 34:39.360
No offence, Father,
but if cleanliness is next to

34:39.360 --> 34:42.159
godliness, then don't expect
any help from above.

34:42.199 --> 34:43.880
What happened to your cassock?

34:43.920 --> 34:47.280
Long story. No time to explain.

34:47.320 --> 34:50.120
But we need to get over
to Raymond Worrall's cottage.

34:50.120 --> 34:52.320
But the place is all locked up.

34:52.360 --> 34:53.840
How do you intend to get in?

34:53.880 --> 34:56.600
Present from Sergeant Goodfellow.

34:56.639 --> 34:57.840
We need to be quick,

34:57.880 --> 35:00.920
before Inspector Mallory
notices I'm missing.

35:00.920 --> 35:04.160
You broke out?! I'm impressed!

35:04.160 --> 35:06.160
Was that wise?

35:06.200 --> 35:08.520
Not entirely. No.

35:20.800 --> 35:24.840
So, somebody shot Raymond Worrall,
left with the gun,

35:24.880 --> 35:26.440
and then locked the door
behind them.

35:26.480 --> 35:27.920
That protestor?

35:29.040 --> 35:30.680
Impossible.

35:30.680 --> 35:33.360
Because she alerted the police
after she heard the first shot,

35:33.400 --> 35:35.720
from the public telephone box
in Kembleford.

35:35.760 --> 35:38.000
She couldn't have got back here
in time to kill him.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.200
It could have been
that prison officer.

35:40.200 --> 35:42.720
I mean, what if she
and Katherine had

35:42.760 --> 35:45.960
a deal that ran to more than
just delivering a few letters?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.600
She was on duty.

35:48.640 --> 35:51.880
Or that rag-and-bone man? He clearly
had a thing for Katherine.

35:51.920 --> 35:54.280
Maybe he killed Raymond
in a jealous rage?

35:54.320 --> 35:56.600
I don't think Blind 'Arry
was capable.

35:56.600 --> 35:59.440
And why would he help me escape
from the police station if

35:59.480 --> 36:00.600
he was responsible?

36:00.640 --> 36:02.240
Well, who, then?

36:02.280 --> 36:06.520
You don't think Katherine Corven
broke out of prison,

36:06.520 --> 36:08.720
shot Raymond and then broke
back in again?

36:08.760 --> 36:10.280
Hardly.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.040
I think the answer
will come from on high.

36:18.920 --> 36:22.560
Father, aren't you a bit long in
the tooth for this kind of caper?

36:22.600 --> 36:23.760
I'll be fine.

36:23.760 --> 36:26.440
Don't be so stubborn
and hold my handbag.

36:28.576 --> 36:29.826
Shall I come up as well?

36:29.851 --> 36:31.005
No need.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.560
Oh, do be careful, Penelope.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.560
You say that like
I've never clambered across

36:37.600 --> 36:39.160
a stranger's rooftop before.

36:39.160 --> 36:42.280
I'm never sure if she says those
things just to try and shock me.

36:51.800 --> 36:54.000
What is it exactly
that I am looking for?

37:13.240 --> 37:15.480
CLATTER

37:21.280 --> 37:22.840
I still don't understand.

37:22.880 --> 37:25.440
Why did the murderer hide
the gun up the chimney?

37:25.480 --> 37:27.360
Why didn't he take it with him?

37:28.680 --> 37:30.400
'He never left the house.

37:32.680 --> 37:37.880
'The stone on the end of the cord
acts as a counterweight.'

37:37.920 --> 37:45.720
So, when Raymond let go of the gun,
it disappeared up the chimney.

37:45.760 --> 37:48.880
An old conjurer's trick, designed
to put the police off the scent.

37:48.880 --> 37:51.120
Raymond shot himself?

37:51.120 --> 37:54.120
And framed me, because he believed

37:54.120 --> 37:57.280
that I sent his lover
to the scaffold.

37:57.320 --> 38:03.480
And the soot on his gardening
gloves from the fire meant that

38:03.520 --> 38:06.560
no-one noticed any burn marks
from the gun.

38:06.600 --> 38:10.200
She must have convinced him to do
it. Lovers reunited in death.

38:10.240 --> 38:15.280
But question - how did you know
that the gun was up the chimney?

38:15.320 --> 38:16.440
An egg.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.360
Jackdaws nest in chimneys.

38:21.400 --> 38:25.640
'And when I found a jackdaw egg
so close to the house,

38:25.680 --> 38:27.960
'I knew that Raymond
must have cleared his out.'

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
But why now, in this warm summer?

38:33.200 --> 38:35.680
And this grate hasn't been used
for months.

38:35.720 --> 38:38.040
All right. Second question.

38:38.040 --> 38:40.800
How on earth are you going to
convince Mallory that that's

38:40.800 --> 38:41.917
what happened?

38:43.560 --> 38:44.920
I'm not.

38:50.640 --> 38:52.680
Sergeant!

38:52.680 --> 38:54.040
Sir?

38:54.080 --> 38:56.920
These letters -
just a load of soppy nonsense.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.960
Is the Padre awake yet?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
I don't think so, sir.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.760
Then wake him up and get him
into the interview room.

39:03.760 --> 39:06.120
Let's see if he'll finally
start talking.

39:06.160 --> 39:09.920
It might take a while, sir.

39:09.960 --> 39:11.960
He's quite a deep sleeper.

39:11.960 --> 39:16.400
Throw a bucket of water
over him if you have to!

39:16.440 --> 39:17.720
Yes, sir.

39:17.720 --> 39:20.880
# And now my song is over

39:20.920 --> 39:23.160
# I've got no more to say

39:23.160 --> 39:27.960
♪ Give us my eggs and brandy
And I'll be on my way. ♪

39:29.520 --> 39:30.760
Is it time for bed yet?

39:30.760 --> 39:33.560
Would somebody please put this man
in a cell where he belongs!

39:33.600 --> 39:35.920
Now what's he done?

39:35.960 --> 39:38.440
We found him trying to steal
the communion wine.

39:38.440 --> 39:40.480
SERGEANT: I'll sort him out, sir.

39:40.480 --> 39:44.240
Good. And don't forget
to wake up the Padre.

39:47.640 --> 39:48.920
What an idiot.

40:08.440 --> 40:13.240
Where have you been?
I asked you to fetch the Padre.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.320
I had to pop out, sir.

40:16.520 --> 40:18.360
"Pop out"?!

40:30.120 --> 40:32.400
Where did you find those?

40:32.400 --> 40:34.480
I had a hunch, sir.

40:34.480 --> 40:38.200
You see, I think Raymond Worrall
killed himself.

40:41.160 --> 40:44.840
I'm sure you understand
I was just doing my job.

40:44.840 --> 40:48.440
Absolutely. No apology necessary.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.600
Well, I'll leave you to it.

40:51.720 --> 40:54.520
I hope it goes without saying
that none of this ever happened.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.360
If the inspector knew I went
behind his back...

40:57.400 --> 40:59.120
My lips are sealed.

40:59.120 --> 41:02.440
And I've spoken to Harold and
he won't be spilling the beans.

41:02.480 --> 41:04.080
How much did that cost you?

41:04.080 --> 41:05.840
A rather fine bottle of Scotch.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.560
Sergeant, you are a good man.

41:08.560 --> 41:11.440
Some of my strawberry scones.

41:11.480 --> 41:12.480
Extra cream.

41:12.520 --> 41:15.200
You didn't need to do that.

41:15.240 --> 41:18.080
Nonsense.
You are a credit to the force.

41:18.120 --> 41:20.520
I couldn't agree more. Thank you.

41:23.200 --> 41:26.640
Right. Duty calls.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.200
So, what now?

41:32.360 --> 41:34.440
Hot meal, hot bath.

41:37.640 --> 41:39.600
What's this?

41:39.640 --> 41:43.280
Get used to it. There'll be
no more special treatment.

41:44.480 --> 41:46.600
That's a big mistake.

41:46.640 --> 41:49.360
I assume you and your gentleman
friend are still playing

41:49.400 --> 41:50.720
hide the truncheon?

41:50.720 --> 41:52.240
You know I wouldn't hesitate
to tell.

41:52.240 --> 41:54.240
Tell whoever you like.

41:54.280 --> 41:57.880
I've handed in my resignation
and he's left his wife.

41:59.160 --> 42:03.040
You may not have long left
in this world,

42:03.040 --> 42:06.240
but I don't intend to be your slave
for another second.

42:06.240 --> 42:08.280
You don't want to be one
of my enemies.

42:08.280 --> 42:10.920
Things don't turn out
so well for them.

42:10.920 --> 42:13.280
Oh, yeah. I nearly forgot.

42:14.800 --> 42:19.160
A little bird told me that
Father Brown has been released.

42:19.200 --> 42:22.680
Turns out Raymond committed suicide.

42:22.720 --> 42:24.960
Such a shame(!)

42:24.960 --> 42:26.560
SHE LAUGHS

42:30.200 --> 42:32.960
Argh!
BANGING ON DOOR

42:36.640 --> 42:37.840
This is very kind of you.

42:37.840 --> 42:41.760
Well, after everything you've been
through? Now, shush, and eat.

42:41.800 --> 42:44.520
We know it was Katherine Corven,
by the way.

42:44.560 --> 42:47.640
And we also know
that you can't speak about it.

42:49.280 --> 42:50.600
Maybe you should go and see her

42:50.600 --> 42:53.560
and show her she's not nearly clever
enough to get one over on the

42:53.600 --> 42:54.760
great Father Brown.

42:56.560 --> 42:59.320
Have you ever heard the story
of the eagle and the daw?

43:01.920 --> 43:03.080
I can't say I have.

43:04.920 --> 43:07.840
A jackdaw sees an eagle swoop down
on a spring lamb,

43:07.840 --> 43:09.280
carrying it away to eat.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.771
The jackdaw believes himself
to be as powerful,

43:13.796 --> 43:17.990
so he flies over, lands on
the back of another lamb,

43:18.034 --> 43:22.143
grips it with his claws and flaps
away with all his might.

43:24.080 --> 43:29.760
But he can't lift the lamb, and
the shepherd sees him, catches him,

43:29.760 --> 43:31.760
clips his wings

43:31.800 --> 43:38.600
and gives him to his children
as a pet in a cage.

43:41.369 --> 43:44.049
Vanity is very dangerous.

43:45.800 --> 43:47.760
But she tried to...

43:47.800 --> 43:49.920
I have no desire to gloat.

43:52.560 --> 43:55.680
I shall pray for the soul
of Katherine Corven,

43:55.720 --> 43:58.760
and that she may finally seek
forgiveness.
