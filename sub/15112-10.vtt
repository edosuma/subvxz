WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:03.420
So you would move?

00:04.291 --> 00:06.131
If that's what she needs,
I'll make it work.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.111
Living in Oregon, your mind

00:08.361 --> 00:10.080
will eventually
have to let go of L.A.

00:10.330 --> 00:11.281
I will be...

00:11.678 --> 00:14.117
incredibly sad to see you go.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.558
Our problem just walked
out of my office.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.852
He resigned.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.021
What girlfriend?
You don't have a girlfriend.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.272
Yeah, I do.

00:23.649 --> 00:24.608
I like him.

00:24.858 --> 00:25.818
Why haven't I met him before?

00:26.068 --> 00:27.319
Dad, I got her pregnant.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.738
You know how you said
that you knew when it happened?

00:29.988 --> 00:30.697
When was that?

00:30.947 --> 00:32.408
Just before Mom died.

00:32.918 --> 00:35.124
Where are you going
? Movers are coming today.

00:35.374 --> 00:35.911
I know.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.740
- Emma?
- Mr. Britten, hi.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.308
Are you...

00:39.706 --> 00:41.810
How... how did you know?

00:42.209 --> 00:43.879
It's... it's Rex's.

00:44.252 --> 00:46.114
Guys, can you give us five, please?

00:46.505 --> 00:47.464
What's going on?

00:49.734 --> 00:51.702
There's something
we need to talk about.

00:55.606 --> 00:57.090
I don't understand.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.559
She's... she's pregnant?

00:58.809 --> 01:00.160
Yeah.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.431
And you're sure
that Rex is the father?

01:03.814 --> 01:06.816
Yeah. Pretty sure.

01:08.952 --> 01:12.338
So, uh, who is she?

01:12.588 --> 01:13.184
Here name is Emm...

01:13.434 --> 01:15.242
No, I mean, not...
not what's her name.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.996
I mean, who is she?

01:21.030 --> 01:22.449
She was Rex's girlfriend.

01:22.699 --> 01:25.084
Why wouldn't he
have told me about her?

01:25.460 --> 01:27.920
You know, I drove him everywhere.

01:28.297 --> 01:29.488
I picked him up.
I took him to practice.

01:29.738 --> 01:31.523
I-I chaperoned his dances.

01:31.773 --> 01:33.759
You know, he...
he told me everything.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.263
Apparently not.

01:44.396 --> 01:46.315
Dad, I got her pregnant.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.402
Well, uh...

01:50.991 --> 01:52.677
we sort of found each other.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.145
Wait, wait.
Okay, so if she's already...

01:55.395 --> 01:57.348
she's five months pregnant, then...

01:57.598 --> 01:59.283
she's decided to keep this baby.

01:59.661 --> 02:00.650
I guess.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.738
What did she say about...
about raising it?

02:04.499 --> 02:06.022
She didn't.

02:06.418 --> 02:07.920
And you didn't ask?

02:10.505 --> 02:12.829
Michael, this girl
is carrying Rex's child.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.731
Before we go anywhere,

02:15.135 --> 02:16.599
we got to figure out

02:17.429 --> 02:19.431
how we're
going to be involved, right?

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:57.844 --> 02:59.606
Mr. Dion Driggs.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.108
Four counts of marijuana possession

03:02.358 --> 03:03.709
with intent to distribute.

03:03.959 --> 03:05.310
Yeah, the neighbors say

03:05.560 --> 03:06.913
he wasn't violent, but...

03:07.163 --> 03:09.015
he did bring scumbags
to the building.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.948
Yeah, looks like
one of them jacked him.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.721
Okay, how do you see it?

03:16.071 --> 03:17.757
Well...

03:18.156 --> 03:20.284
suspect here,
bursts through the door,

03:20.842 --> 03:22.527
shoots Mr. Driggs in the head,

03:22.911 --> 03:25.030
and then grabs the laptop...

03:25.414 --> 03:26.665
a game console, whatever.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.400
All right, so this guy's
a drug dealer, right?

03:29.650 --> 03:31.870
And I'm looking around,
and I don't see any drugs.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.255
Maybe that was it.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.305
Maybe they took the stash.

03:39.428 --> 03:40.763
Okay, so let's keep it going.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.145
He gets that,

03:42.395 --> 03:43.480
runs out the door,

03:43.890 --> 03:45.849
goes down the hallway, okay?

03:46.099 --> 03:47.918
He's trying to make the escape.

03:48.168 --> 03:49.820
He gets to the staircase.

03:50.070 --> 03:51.321
In there, he runs into...

03:51.571 --> 03:54.390
This is Mrs. Maya King.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.026
83 years old.

03:57.276 --> 03:59.562
Never leaves the apartment
except to buy groceries.

03:59.812 --> 04:01.130
Wrong place, wrong time.

04:01.380 --> 04:03.332
He's got a stolen stash in his hand.

04:03.582 --> 04:05.234
He's got a dead body behind him.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.003
Shoots her, runs out.

04:07.253 --> 04:08.670
Whole thing's over in less
than five minutes.

04:08.920 --> 04:10.459
The landlord's waiting
to show us her place.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.336
You ready?

04:16.261 --> 04:18.480
This is Mrs. King's apartment.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.548
Thank you, Mr. Wilson.

04:20.798 --> 04:21.950
Of course.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.390
I'm afraid
police intervention has become

04:24.640 --> 04:26.487
quite a thing in this building.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.657
Still, I was surprised
that it was Mrs. King.

04:29.907 --> 04:31.230
She was a wonderful tenant.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.127
Moved in here with her husband

04:33.523 --> 04:35.997
over 50 years ago, long before
I bought the building.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.695
Do you know of any family or
next of kin that we can notify?

04:38.945 --> 04:40.634
Well, her husband
passed away years ago.

04:40.884 --> 04:42.168
She had an only son.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.370
Was a soldier, died in Vietnam.

04:44.785 --> 04:45.839
Did she have any close friends

04:46.089 --> 04:47.704
or neighbors you can think of?

04:47.954 --> 04:48.942
Well, she outlived most of them.

04:49.192 --> 04:51.333
Any neighbor that was close
to her age got out of here

04:51.583 --> 04:52.545
a long time ago.

04:52.795 --> 04:54.294
I-I told her it was unsafe.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.814
I got out of here years ago.

04:56.064 --> 04:57.482
I wanted her to get out of here,

04:57.732 --> 04:58.799
but she wouldn't listen.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.552
She had faith in the community.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.387
I'm sorry she was so wrong.

05:05.722 --> 05:06.391
I'll talk to patrol,

05:06.641 --> 05:08.027
see if there's
anything on the street.

05:08.277 --> 05:09.895
Get somebody started
looking at the gang database

05:10.145 --> 05:11.311
for known associates.

05:11.646 --> 05:13.965
I'm gonna get some guys
from the pawn shop detail,

05:14.215 --> 05:15.533
check some things out for us.

05:15.783 --> 05:16.901
We might get lucky.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.270
Let's, uh...

05:19.520 --> 05:20.529
knock on all these doors here,

05:20.854 --> 05:22.807
see if anybody saw
the shooter going in or out.

05:23.057 --> 05:23.841
Yeah.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.160
Poor Maya should've moved out.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.328
The landlord was right.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.681
Sometimes you got to know

05:30.931 --> 05:32.249
when it's time to move on.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.851
I understand. I get it.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.953
You don't want
a good-bye party, then fine.

05:37.203 --> 05:38.822
No party.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.839
Thanks.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.511
I mean, I just...

05:44.761 --> 05:47.496
wanted to express my gratitude.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.642
Thank you for everything you
taught me in the past six months.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.235
- If you want to deprive me of that...
- I do.

05:53.485 --> 05:54.570
So be it.

05:54.980 --> 05:57.173
- Good.
- I am, you know?

05:57.566 --> 05:58.774
Grateful.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.374
Heads up.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.945
Just got a call...
Sampson Trujillo is back.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.580
- In Los Angeles?
- Yep.

06:05.830 --> 06:06.848
I don't believe it.

06:07.098 --> 06:08.416
Nobody called me.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.704
- Hold up. Who's Trujillo?
- Cocaine dealer, arms dealer,

06:10.954 --> 06:12.748
you name it.
He was a big player in L.A.

06:12.998 --> 06:14.750
We can tie him
to at least three open murders.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.256
Vega, I'm attaching you
to the federal task force.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.959
You're going to take the
lead for our office.

06:19.379 --> 06:19.420
Me?

06:19.670 --> 06:21.465
Yeah, I'm going to put
you with DaSilva.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.097
Captain?

06:23.508 --> 06:24.531
Captain...

06:24.926 --> 06:26.845
I got a... I got a file
this big on this guy.

06:27.584 --> 06:29.014
I've been working on it for years.

06:29.264 --> 06:30.170
I could write a book.

06:30.420 --> 06:31.934
You're going to
be gone in three days.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.906
I need somebody who
can close these cases.

06:34.156 --> 06:35.187
All right?

06:45.167 --> 06:46.252
All right, sit down.

06:46.502 --> 06:48.268
You got a lot to learn.

06:59.914 --> 07:02.014
Come on.

07:02.839 --> 07:03.901
It's one cigarette.

07:04.151 --> 07:06.137
You said that last time,

07:06.551 --> 07:08.888
but everyone could smell it on me.

07:13.193 --> 07:15.512
My distributors are getting anxious.

07:15.936 --> 07:19.283
I told you, Britten is
going to be gone in three days.

07:19.533 --> 07:21.017
Three days?
Are you sure?

07:21.267 --> 07:22.318
Yes.

07:22.734 --> 07:25.989
I just chipped in 300 bucks
for the champagne.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.532
You know, I need to move the
last Westfield shipment quickly,

07:28.908 --> 07:30.760
and I can't do anything
until he's gone.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.871
You need to be patient.

07:36.748 --> 07:39.084
You know what the two
worst things are for heroin?

07:40.818 --> 07:42.671
Let's assume that I don't.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.773
Oxygen and humidity.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.134
Our product's been in storage
since Britten's accident.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.261
It's oxidizing.

07:50.361 --> 07:52.146
I've waited patiently

07:52.556 --> 07:53.781
because you told me
you could handle this.

07:54.031 --> 07:56.583
So now I'm going to wait
three more days,

07:56.833 --> 08:00.397
and if he's still a problem,
I'm going to take care of him.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.724
So tell me how this works.

08:04.974 --> 08:06.993
I'm awake with my
wife, and I close my eyes,

08:07.612 --> 08:09.562
I open them, I'm awake with my son.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.242
And this has been happening
since the accident?

08:14.745 --> 08:16.236
So you begin working on one case

08:16.663 --> 08:18.082
here in reality, and then suddenly

08:18.957 --> 08:21.043
you begin working another case
there in your dream.

08:21.293 --> 08:24.009
It all feels completely real to me.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.256
You can't tell whether
you're awake or asleep

08:26.506 --> 08:27.341
at this very moment?

08:27.591 --> 08:28.008
Well, I can assure you,

08:28.675 --> 08:30.302
Detective Britten,
this is not a dream.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.929
That's exactly
what the other shrink said.

08:44.393 --> 08:45.609
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:45.932 --> 08:47.917
I'm Angela.
This is my husband Joaquin.

08:48.167 --> 08:48.987
Pleasure.

08:49.335 --> 08:50.572
And,

08:50.904 --> 08:52.422
this, of course, is Emma.

08:52.908 --> 08:53.589
Mr. Britten.

08:53.839 --> 08:54.701
Hi, Emma.

08:55.041 --> 08:56.995
I'm Michael.

08:58.945 --> 09:00.029
- Hi, and this...
- Hannah, hi.

09:00.279 --> 09:01.375
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

09:01.713 --> 09:03.419
- Hi. Come on in.
- Thank you.

09:05.551 --> 09:07.136
- Mrs. Britten.
- Hi.

09:07.506 --> 09:09.258
I heard so much about you.

09:09.587 --> 09:12.678
I like your shirt.
Are you a Vampire Weekend fan?

09:13.024 --> 09:15.097
Yeah, I guess so.

09:15.427 --> 09:18.559
You know, Rex was really into them.

09:18.809 --> 09:20.348
When he was 14 he
practically forced Michael

09:20.598 --> 09:22.020
to take him to a concert.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.903
That's his shirt.

09:32.409 --> 09:35.033
We consider ourselves

09:35.379 --> 09:36.864
fairly progressive,

09:37.114 --> 09:39.633
but we definitely weren't
prepared for this.

09:39.883 --> 09:40.873
Yeah, believe me,

09:41.217 --> 09:43.036
we're still trying to get
our heads around it.

09:43.286 --> 09:44.209
Of course you are.

09:44.553 --> 09:45.872
One thing we realized is that...

09:46.122 --> 09:49.339
this doesn't have to limit
the rest of Emma's life.

09:49.658 --> 09:51.884
She's gonna finish school
with her classmates.

09:52.228 --> 09:54.094
Go to college.

09:54.430 --> 09:56.513
Yeah, have you thought
about where you want to go?

09:56.832 --> 09:58.516
I've narrowed it down
to a few schools

09:58.766 --> 10:00.142
on the east coast.

10:00.469 --> 10:03.395
Yeah, uh, Rex wanted to go back east.

10:06.574 --> 10:08.260
Actually, that's something

10:08.510 --> 10:11.096
that Michael and I wanted
to talk to you about.

10:11.346 --> 10:14.490
Well, we would

10:14.815 --> 10:17.034
love to be as involved as,

10:17.351 --> 10:18.302
as you would let us.

10:18.552 --> 10:20.079
A-And just to be there for

10:20.421 --> 10:21.806
you and the baby.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.574
For anything, doctor's appointments,

10:23.824 --> 10:25.501
babysitting,

10:25.826 --> 10:26.978
whatever we can do.

10:27.228 --> 10:28.646
That's a really beautiful offer.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.964
Really, it is but...

10:31.297 --> 10:35.135
I'm afraid we've made
other arrangements.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.013
Other arrangements?

10:38.338 --> 10:39.455
We've been working with an agency,

10:39.705 --> 10:42.225
and we found a couple...

10:42.475 --> 10:44.561
who we're sure will
make great parents.

10:44.877 --> 10:47.529
We looked into this thoroughly.

10:47.779 --> 10:49.149
We weighed all our options,

10:49.481 --> 10:52.027
and what we've decided
is that adoption

10:52.451 --> 10:54.203
would give Emma the most closure.

10:54.453 --> 10:57.699
And as we said,
that's our top priority.

10:58.057 --> 11:00.119
We understand you're
focused on this new child,

11:00.492 --> 11:04.164
but Emma's still our child,
and we have to put her first.

11:04.529 --> 11:07.126
What if we adopt it?

11:07.498 --> 11:09.044
The-the baby. We...

11:13.256 --> 11:15.384
The truth is that Hannah and I

11:15.739 --> 11:17.428
had been talking about having

11:17.774 --> 11:19.388
another baby, anyway, so...

11:19.742 --> 11:21.494
No, I'm sorry.
We've all agreed

11:21.744 --> 11:23.964
that a closed adoption
is what's best.

11:24.214 --> 11:26.599
Emma felt that maintaining
any connection to this baby

11:26.849 --> 11:28.355
would just be too hard for her.

11:28.718 --> 11:30.482
We're moving to Portland, and,

11:30.732 --> 11:32.609
you could have as much or as little

11:32.956 --> 11:34.026
involvement as you would want.

11:34.276 --> 11:36.339
Look, I realize how
hard this is for you,

11:36.589 --> 11:39.345
and we're not insensitive
to what you're going there,

11:40.033 --> 11:42.244
but at the end of the day,
this is Emma's decision.

11:42.598 --> 11:45.622
And this is what she wants.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.104
It is.

12:00.281 --> 12:02.765
Did you see Emma's face?

12:04.285 --> 12:07.204
She looked pretty shaken up, but...

12:07.454 --> 12:09.980
it was an awkward
situation for all of us.

12:10.324 --> 12:12.276
No, uh-uh, it was more than that.

12:12.526 --> 12:13.777
It was like...

12:14.027 --> 12:15.612
they were talking for Emma

12:15.986 --> 12:18.530
saying she wanted to put
this baby up for adoption.

12:18.898 --> 12:20.282
Well, she agreed.

12:20.634 --> 12:21.985
She said she agreed...

12:22.235 --> 12:25.621
but it was like they were
making the decision for her.

12:28.241 --> 12:30.209
You didn't pick up on that?

12:31.744 --> 12:34.046
Honestly... no.

12:36.749 --> 12:40.335
Maybe you can want
something so much that...

12:40.585 --> 12:42.388
it's easy to project.

12:42.754 --> 12:43.906
I'm not projecting, Michael.

12:44.156 --> 12:47.475
I... I'm telling you...

12:47.726 --> 12:49.978
they're pushing her to do
something she doesn't want.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.798
I know how much it means to you.

13:03.207 --> 13:05.035
Game machine.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.277
And, uh...

13:09.112 --> 13:11.375
All right, the laptop
has the same serial number

13:11.625 --> 13:13.166
as the receipt we found
in the apartment.

13:13.416 --> 13:14.968
We got to take this stuff in.

13:15.218 --> 13:16.469
It's evidence in a crime scene.

13:16.719 --> 13:18.471
That's 150 bucks down the toilet.

13:18.721 --> 13:20.759
I don't suppose you took the I.D.

13:21.123 --> 13:23.053
of the guy who sold it to you?

13:23.303 --> 13:25.305
Yeah. Sure.

13:26.695 --> 13:28.600
He was real big with, like, a...

13:28.963 --> 13:31.283
patchy beard and crazy bug eyes.

13:31.533 --> 13:32.617
Sounds delightful.

13:32.867 --> 13:35.608
Who do you think we got coming
in here, the Kardashians?

13:36.938 --> 13:38.723
2642 Hibbing Street.

13:38.973 --> 13:40.487
All right, we got an address.

13:40.842 --> 13:42.427
He was here for over a year.

13:42.677 --> 13:45.263
But he couldn't make rent,
so they gave him the boot.

13:45.513 --> 13:47.161
He had trouble with drinking.

13:47.515 --> 13:48.899
Any idea where he might be now?

13:49.149 --> 13:51.069
I hear he's living on the streets.

13:51.319 --> 13:53.083
What streets?

14:14.673 --> 14:16.092
How you guys doing?

14:16.342 --> 14:17.816
You know someone called Perry?

14:18.176 --> 14:19.777
Perry Jenkins?
Big tall bald guy?

14:20.112 --> 14:23.197
Perry! These guys
are looking for you.

14:26.252 --> 14:27.159
Jenkins! Stop!

14:30.355 --> 14:31.439
Go!

14:31.689 --> 14:32.915
I'm going!
Where are you?

14:33.258 --> 14:34.208
Stop!

14:49.205 --> 14:49.932
Stop!

14:52.942 --> 14:55.611
Where were you?

14:58.482 --> 14:59.400
Murder?

14:59.650 --> 15:00.818
What, are you kidding me?

15:01.151 --> 15:03.002
So why'd you run, Perry?

15:03.252 --> 15:04.279
Why do you think?

15:04.620 --> 15:05.572
Where'd you get it?

15:05.921 --> 15:06.839
Found a whole bag of weed

15:07.089 --> 15:08.033
in the Dumpster behind the Kwikmart.

15:08.356 --> 15:09.741
Come on, man,
look, we know you brought

15:09.991 --> 15:11.120
Dion's items into the pawnshop.

15:11.459 --> 15:13.789
Dion? What, you mean
the video games and stuff?

15:14.128 --> 15:17.459
I found all that in the trash, too.

15:17.799 --> 15:19.753
Where's this Kwikmart?

15:20.101 --> 15:21.420
It's down there by the Video Den.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.174
I'll take you.

15:24.805 --> 15:26.301
- It's on the way.
- No. No.

15:40.357 --> 15:43.706
If nothing turns up in here,
I'm gonna lock you away forever.

15:43.956 --> 15:45.195
You get that?

15:53.333 --> 15:54.750
This doesn't make any sense.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.331
Who would kill Driggs for his stuff

15:56.768 --> 15:59.031
and then turn around and
throw it into a Dumpster?

15:59.281 --> 15:59.668
I don't know.

16:00.004 --> 16:02.504
But not that guy.

16:31.993 --> 16:33.119
Hi.

16:35.196 --> 16:36.205
Hi.

16:36.597 --> 16:38.165
It was so awkward the other night,

16:38.666 --> 16:40.084
I came to say I'm sorry.

16:43.204 --> 16:44.704
Here.

16:45.740 --> 16:48.126
A peace offering.

16:48.376 --> 16:50.010
I saw you drinking

16:50.410 --> 16:52.262
out of that plastic bottle,
and I read somewhere

16:52.645 --> 16:54.515
it's bad for the baby, so...

16:54.982 --> 16:56.767
Glass.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.187
Thanks.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.088
Yeah.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.474
I also came because...

17:05.724 --> 17:07.152
I saw something that night,

17:07.560 --> 17:08.904
and...

17:09.295 --> 17:12.031
if I'm wrong,
you can tell me to get out.

17:16.167 --> 17:19.665
I'm not really sure what you mean.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.593
You didn't seem as
certain as your parents

17:24.843 --> 17:26.130
about giving up this baby,

17:26.512 --> 17:28.674
and I want to be sure that

17:29.080 --> 17:30.098
you're doing this for you,

17:30.348 --> 17:32.719
because you want to and not
because they want you to.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.703
Look, you don't even know my parents.

17:34.953 --> 17:37.273
Well, I don't need
to know them, Emma.

17:37.523 --> 17:38.684
This isn't about them.

17:38.934 --> 17:41.242
This is your decision.

17:41.812 --> 17:44.440
It's about you and...
and this baby.

17:47.298 --> 17:48.068
Nobody else.

17:48.466 --> 17:49.517
Really?

17:49.767 --> 17:52.573
Because right now it seems
like it's all about you.

17:52.970 --> 17:54.700
All about you

17:55.104 --> 17:56.869
not getting to raise this baby.

17:57.273 --> 17:59.747
You can tell yourself

18:00.143 --> 18:01.228
whatever you want,

18:01.478 --> 18:03.363
that you came here to...

18:03.613 --> 18:04.793
save me.

18:05.181 --> 18:08.047
You're just wasting your time.

18:09.686 --> 18:12.134
I've made my decision.

18:15.324 --> 18:17.577
I'm such an idiot.

18:18.056 --> 18:20.684
You did what you thought was right.

18:20.934 --> 18:24.417
No, I mean, she must think
I'm, like, some kind of stalker.

18:24.667 --> 18:26.398
And you know the worst part?

18:26.801 --> 18:27.719
What?

18:27.969 --> 18:30.054
I really did think I was helping her,

18:30.304 --> 18:32.591
like I was stopping her
from making some...

18:32.841 --> 18:33.947
decision that she

18:34.342 --> 18:35.909
was gonna regret.

18:37.612 --> 18:40.037
How'd I get it so wrong?

18:40.414 --> 18:44.000
Look, sometimes you
want something so badly

18:44.250 --> 18:46.502
that it blinds you
to everything else.

18:50.056 --> 18:51.575
I did, Michael.

18:51.825 --> 18:54.827
I-I wanted it that badly.

18:56.363 --> 18:57.930
I know, honey.

19:05.204 --> 19:07.189
Thank you.

19:07.573 --> 19:08.958
For what?

19:09.208 --> 19:10.442
I don't know, just...

19:10.843 --> 19:13.696
listening to me and...

19:13.946 --> 19:15.572
being there.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.616
You're stuck with me.

19:21.753 --> 19:23.455
I love you.

19:25.023 --> 19:26.991
I love you, too.

19:33.030 --> 19:34.967
Police seized nearly
20 kilos from the scene, making it

19:35.365 --> 19:38.387
one of the largest busts
L.A. has seen in recent memory.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.488
Police Captain Tricia Harper
commended SWAT

19:40.738 --> 19:41.807
and lead detective

19:42.205 --> 19:44.810
Efrem Vega on a job well done.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.833
I look good on TV.

19:54.319 --> 19:55.669
Don't you think, Mike?

19:55.919 --> 19:59.454
I don't really gauge the
attractiveness of other men, you know?

20:00.790 --> 20:02.661
Okay, but you can appreciate
a good cheekbone.

20:03.058 --> 20:06.290
People in the quiet
neighborhood were surprised to learn

20:06.662 --> 20:09.710
that this house had been a home
to one of the largest drug rings

20:10.098 --> 20:11.670
Los Angeles has seen this year.

20:25.434 --> 20:27.186
Mike, you're not supposed
to be down here.

20:27.582 --> 20:28.766
I'm looking for the video games

20:29.016 --> 20:30.835
from the double murder in
the apartment the other day.

20:31.085 --> 20:32.316
All right, just wait, okay?

20:32.687 --> 20:33.671
How do you find anything here?

20:33.921 --> 20:35.444
Nothing's in order.
It's chaos.

20:35.822 --> 20:36.940
No, there is a system.

20:37.190 --> 20:38.739
Just don't touch anything.

20:41.227 --> 20:42.979
It just got back from processing.

20:43.229 --> 20:45.287
Thank you.

20:45.665 --> 20:47.765
Come on.

20:53.205 --> 20:54.505
That's it.

20:56.174 --> 20:57.549
Where's the disk?

20:57.943 --> 21:01.595
I don't know. Maybe some detective
came down here and took it.

21:01.981 --> 21:03.639
Maybe it's in his machine.

21:04.016 --> 21:05.391
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

21:05.784 --> 21:06.768
How do I switch this on?...

21:07.018 --> 21:08.728
turn the TV to game mode.

21:11.889 --> 21:12.981
No, it's the...

21:13.357 --> 21:14.525
The button.

21:14.892 --> 21:16.318
It's... Can I...?

21:16.694 --> 21:19.488
Here. And then you, uh,
press the center button

21:19.864 --> 21:21.573
and you toggle the left switch.

21:21.823 --> 21:23.617
We are... online.

21:28.238 --> 21:30.223
I have friends who...

21:30.473 --> 21:31.583
play them.

21:31.975 --> 21:33.168
Okay.

21:35.145 --> 21:36.839
So... now what?

21:37.147 --> 21:38.924
I'm not sure.

21:44.219 --> 21:45.431
Is that part of the game?

21:45.821 --> 21:47.933
Yeah, it's a message
from another player.

21:48.323 --> 21:49.574
- Live? Now?
- Yeah, yeah.

21:49.824 --> 21:51.076
- Can I talk to him?
- Yeah.

21:51.326 --> 21:52.938
No, you, here,

21:53.328 --> 21:54.246
I just type here?

21:54.496 --> 21:56.317
He can see you. Just talk...

21:57.232 --> 21:58.527
Where's Dion?

21:58.900 --> 22:00.419
I'm Detective Britten.

22:00.669 --> 22:01.653
This is Detective Bird.

22:01.903 --> 22:03.615
Where with the Los Angeles
Police Department.

22:04.004 --> 22:05.123
No. I knew it.

22:05.373 --> 22:07.119
I knew something bad had happened.

22:07.508 --> 22:08.370
Where are you?

22:08.742 --> 22:09.955
Stockholm.

22:10.344 --> 22:11.039
He's in Sweden.

22:11.412 --> 22:14.132
Yeah, I-I know where Stockholm is.
Thanks.

22:14.382 --> 22:15.669
How do you know Dion?

22:16.050 --> 22:18.338
I've never met him, but we used
to play together for years...

22:19.152 --> 22:20.966
until the other day.

22:21.354 --> 22:22.705
What happened then?

22:22.955 --> 22:23.844
I don't know.

22:24.224 --> 22:26.305
We were playing the Crime Spree,

22:26.555 --> 22:28.724
and he said he heard a gunshot.

22:29.095 --> 22:31.518
And then, he paused the game

22:31.898 --> 22:35.606
to go look, and he never came back.

22:35.967 --> 22:37.983
Is he okay?

22:38.370 --> 22:41.487
Maya was killed before
Dion, not after.

22:41.907 --> 22:44.760
So Mrs. King is coming up
the stairs with her groceries,

22:45.240 --> 22:47.078
and the shooter's here...

22:48.744 --> 22:49.565
...and he takes her out

22:49.815 --> 22:51.997
before she has a chance
to witness anything.

22:52.850 --> 22:54.150
Why?

22:54.852 --> 22:57.805
Maybe he had to kill her first
before he could take out Dion.

22:58.055 --> 22:59.507
For what? For his stuff?

22:59.757 --> 23:01.076
He didn't want the guy's stuff.

23:01.326 --> 23:02.508
He put it in the Dumpster.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.562
Okay, so what was he looking for?

23:09.765 --> 23:11.018
Cover.

23:11.268 --> 23:12.752
That's why he shot him second.

23:13.268 --> 23:15.322
That's why he dumped the stuff.

23:15.572 --> 23:17.324
He didn't come for him.

23:17.574 --> 23:19.858
He came here to kill Maya King.

23:26.043 --> 23:27.795
Maya King...

23:28.325 --> 23:30.531
really is so sad.

23:30.781 --> 23:32.432
Maya was Miss Pearl's best friend.

23:32.682 --> 23:34.498
How did she take the news?

23:35.119 --> 23:37.584
Okay, in her own way.

23:37.834 --> 23:38.672
Hello, Pearl.

23:38.922 --> 23:40.673
We'd like to ask you a few questions

23:40.923 --> 23:42.339
about your friend Maya.

23:43.492 --> 23:45.192
Pearl?

23:48.095 --> 23:49.972
You think you can help us?

23:50.222 --> 23:51.974
I'd like to,

23:52.224 --> 23:55.254
but I don't know why
I should help Myron.

23:55.504 --> 23:57.255
You are a lousy grandson.

23:57.505 --> 24:01.775
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but I'm not your grandson.

24:02.025 --> 24:03.902
You missed Christmas,
you missed my birthday.

24:05.153 --> 24:07.823
Pearl, the reason that Myron here

24:08.073 --> 24:10.492
hasn't been to visit is because

24:10.742 --> 24:13.120
he's been helping the police
with special investigations.

24:13.370 --> 24:15.289
What kind of investigations?

24:15.539 --> 24:17.207
Well, he helps us find killers,

24:17.708 --> 24:19.585
like the person who hurt Maya.

24:19.835 --> 24:22.337
Is that true, Myron?

24:22.587 --> 24:24.287
Myron?

24:25.699 --> 24:27.426
Yes, ma'am.

24:27.676 --> 24:29.619
I'm proud of you.

24:29.970 --> 24:33.122
So, can you help us?

24:33.372 --> 24:35.934
Can you tell us
something about Maya?

24:36.184 --> 24:38.127
She liked cooking.
She loved it.

24:38.729 --> 24:39.896
And she loved cats,

24:40.146 --> 24:43.484
and the music of Mr. Sammy Davis Jr.

24:43.734 --> 24:47.235
Okay, and was there anybody
she didn't get along with?

24:47.485 --> 24:48.864
Everybody loved her.

24:49.114 --> 24:51.173
Even those rude boys
out on the corner...

24:51.423 --> 24:53.542
they'd tip their hats and say,

24:53.792 --> 24:56.121
"Good Morning, Miss Maya."

24:56.371 --> 24:58.080
What about her friends?

24:58.330 --> 25:01.282
Anyone she was close to
in the building?

25:01.532 --> 25:03.629
Well, at one time, we were all close.

25:03.879 --> 25:06.220
But little by little,
people moved out,

25:06.470 --> 25:08.556
passed away or ended up here.

25:08.806 --> 25:10.677
Isn't this lovely?

25:13.930 --> 25:16.683
So, there's more than one person
from the building here?

25:17.180 --> 25:19.686
Yes, of course..

25:19.936 --> 25:22.268
And at one time,
there was more than that,

25:22.814 --> 25:24.270
but you know, at my age,

25:24.520 --> 25:26.707
you get used to that sort of thing.

25:26.957 --> 25:28.320
It was dangerous there.

25:28.925 --> 25:31.011
It's so much safer here.

25:31.365 --> 25:32.845
Right.

25:33.095 --> 25:35.180
And did you all want
to stay together?

25:35.430 --> 25:37.246
Why did you all end up here?

25:37.496 --> 25:39.706
Mr. Wilson. Curtis.

25:40.236 --> 25:42.167
He pays for everything.

25:45.574 --> 25:48.340
Your landlord pays
for you to be here?

25:48.590 --> 25:50.361
Yes. He pays for all of us.

25:51.176 --> 25:54.432
It's too bad poor Maya
didn't take that offer, too.

25:54.682 --> 25:56.367
So, he wanted Maya to move?

25:56.723 --> 25:58.369
Yes, but she didn't want to.

25:58.619 --> 26:00.227
Pearl, why do you think

26:00.721 --> 26:02.874
Mr. Wilson would pay
for everybody to be here?

26:03.124 --> 26:04.875
I've known him for 30 years.

26:05.125 --> 26:06.877
He's a nice boy.

26:07.484 --> 26:10.487
Which is more than I can
say for Myron over here.

26:14.408 --> 26:15.452
Turns out, when Curtis Wilson said

26:15.702 --> 26:16.854
he wanted out of the neighborhood,

26:17.104 --> 26:17.828
he's not kidding.

26:18.272 --> 26:19.422
He basically owns this whole block.

26:19.672 --> 26:21.057
He's been taking offers for a year.

26:21.307 --> 26:23.860
So, how much does a block in
Westlake go for these days?

26:24.110 --> 26:25.169
North of ten million.

26:25.419 --> 26:26.195
Ten million?...

26:26.445 --> 26:28.131
Hell, I'd take you out
for ten million.

26:28.381 --> 26:29.423
The problem is,

26:29.673 --> 26:31.300
Maya King, Pearl,
the other senior residents...

26:31.550 --> 26:33.670
they were all there
before he bought the place.

26:33.920 --> 26:34.928
They were on rent control.

26:35.178 --> 26:36.171
So, let me guess.

26:36.421 --> 26:37.514
He can't sell the building
without their consent?

26:37.764 --> 26:38.674
Exactly.

26:39.057 --> 26:41.743
So he ships Pearl and the others
to nursing homes,

26:41.993 --> 26:43.395
and then, when Maya won't go...

26:43.645 --> 26:45.113
Boom. Shoots her,
shoots Dion to make it look

26:45.363 --> 26:46.690
like she got caught in the crossfire.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.942
And who's going to question
a guy like Dion getting

26:49.192 --> 26:50.736
shot in that neighborhood?
Happens every day.

26:50.986 --> 26:52.696
The thing is, his alibi checks out.

26:53.137 --> 26:54.656
I mean, I verified it myself.

26:54.906 --> 26:55.990
So, he's didn't do it himself.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.725
Look, he's not the kind of guy

26:57.975 --> 26:59.787
to get his hands dirty,
anyway, is he?

27:00.037 --> 27:02.081
Okay, well, let's pull
the phone and bank records.

27:02.331 --> 27:04.374
See if we can establish contact
with the shooter.

27:04.624 --> 27:06.293
Sound just like a detective.

27:26.168 --> 27:29.521
Did a lot of good work at this desk.

27:29.900 --> 27:31.568
I don't know.
Maybe we should have it bronzed.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.525
Can we?

27:33.904 --> 27:36.528
It's not in the budget.

27:36.907 --> 27:39.497
At least you have
your memories, right?

27:39.993 --> 27:41.493
Yeah.

27:42.049 --> 27:45.169
I seem to remember a sensitivity
seminar in Culver City

27:45.419 --> 27:50.507
with a very skinny
narcotics detective with

27:50.879 --> 27:52.243
- a big red fro.
- No.

27:52.631 --> 27:53.477
An out to here fro.

27:53.727 --> 27:55.092
You had to go there, didn't you?

27:55.342 --> 27:57.013
Who stuffed all the brownies
from the buffet into her purse.

27:57.263 --> 27:58.637
I didn't take 'em all.
You know what?

27:58.887 --> 28:00.097
I think I gave you one, right?

28:00.347 --> 28:01.551
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.

28:01.801 --> 28:03.851
You always had my back.

28:06.478 --> 28:08.564
You okay?

28:13.078 --> 28:15.397
I'm going to miss you.

28:15.779 --> 28:18.407
Back at you, boss.

28:29.302 --> 28:30.961
You got here early.

28:32.298 --> 28:34.963
Yeah, I got an e-mail a few hours
ago with Curtis Wilson's records.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.175
I thought I'd get a jump on it.

28:36.644 --> 28:38.969
Nice. You find anything interesting?

28:39.412 --> 28:40.464
The bank records were useless,

28:40.714 --> 28:42.299
but the phone records
turned up something interesting.

28:42.549 --> 28:44.201
He received a call
from a throwaway phone

28:44.451 --> 28:46.226
just before and just after
the murder.

28:46.686 --> 28:48.812
So, I went to the U.S. Marshals,
got a subpoena. Turn out,

28:49.256 --> 28:50.640
they're the only two calls
ever made from that phone,

28:50.890 --> 28:51.607
and they were both made

28:52.058 --> 28:53.576
from this building...

28:53.826 --> 28:56.312
the 1800 block of Figueroa.

28:56.562 --> 28:57.321
30 units.

28:57.763 --> 28:59.848
Went through the residents,
the records.

29:00.098 --> 29:01.033
Comes down to this guy.

29:01.500 --> 29:04.387
Milo Owens, 30 years old.

29:04.637 --> 29:06.288
Parolee, history of heroin use,

29:06.739 --> 29:09.124
uh, possession, dealing,
armed robbery, bunch of

29:09.575 --> 29:11.159
really nasty stuff, and I'm saying,

29:11.409 --> 29:14.838
Mr. Owens here is due a call
from L.A.'s finest.

29:27.224 --> 29:28.519
- Get down on the ground!
- Police!

29:28.958 --> 29:30.062
- Show me your hands!
- Get down!

29:30.527 --> 29:31.397
- Down!
- On the floor!

29:31.861 --> 29:33.399
Down! Get down!
Get on the floor!

29:34.898 --> 29:35.818
Milo Owens?

29:36.266 --> 29:36.693
Yeah.

29:37.133 --> 29:38.195
Just checking.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.574
All right, let's search the place.

29:46.575 --> 29:48.122
Mike?

29:50.313 --> 29:51.531
Under the mattress.

29:51.959 --> 29:53.881
Criminal mastermind, no?

29:56.652 --> 29:58.340
All right, Milo,

29:58.654 --> 30:00.372
we have everything we need on you.

30:00.622 --> 30:01.468
You know that.

30:01.923 --> 30:03.608
Essentially, we own you right now.

30:03.858 --> 30:05.097
You got that?

30:05.560 --> 30:08.642
I mean, we know you shot Dion
and that nice old lady.

30:09.096 --> 30:10.982
And we're here to help
save you the trouble

30:11.232 --> 30:12.646
of having to pretend
you didn't do it.

30:13.100 --> 30:13.981
No, I didn't.
I was at home.

30:14.436 --> 30:15.566
- I was in my apartment.
- Shh, shh, shh. Milo.

30:16.002 --> 30:16.900
- No, I didn't. I...
- Shh, shh.

30:17.338 --> 30:18.289
You're just hurting yourself.

30:18.539 --> 30:19.194
Just shut up.

30:19.640 --> 30:22.781
Lucky for you, what we really want

30:23.243 --> 30:24.562
is the guy that hired you.

30:24.812 --> 30:26.430
So, if you play ball with us,

30:26.680 --> 30:27.664
you're nice, you help us,

30:27.914 --> 30:29.455
we tell the D.A.
you were cooperative,

30:29.916 --> 30:32.291
and then maybe,
you spend your jail time

30:32.752 --> 30:34.835
cleaning up, watching
TV, getting an education.

30:35.287 --> 30:36.406
Anything.

30:37.045 --> 30:38.756
But you don't help us out...

30:39.191 --> 30:41.341
The next needle will be your last.

30:41.794 --> 30:44.053
Who hired you

30:44.497 --> 30:47.347
to kill Mrs. King and Mr. Driggs?

30:47.799 --> 30:50.642
It was Curtis. Wilson.
Mr. Wilson.

30:51.102 --> 30:52.144
He paid me five grand.

30:52.604 --> 30:55.773
- He told me nobody would find out.
- Well,

30:56.207 --> 30:57.459
he was wrong.

30:58.025 --> 30:59.777
So now help us bring him in.

31:00.211 --> 31:02.696
You have any kind of proof
that he made contact with you?

31:03.147 --> 31:04.615
Some, uh...
something written maybe?

31:05.048 --> 31:06.325
- A text, an e-mail?
- No.

31:06.784 --> 31:07.659
Got a voice mail?

31:08.118 --> 31:10.204
He just always wanted
to meet in person.

31:10.654 --> 31:12.122
Okay, well, then,

31:12.556 --> 31:15.918
this is going to be a little bit
more difficult... for you.

31:16.360 --> 31:19.296
Mr. Wilson, it's Milo.

31:20.096 --> 31:22.674
Why are you calling me?

31:23.366 --> 31:25.218
I'm sorry. I-I...

31:25.468 --> 31:28.021
I know you said not to, but,

31:28.271 --> 31:31.258
I've been thinking about it,
and, uh, I want more money.

31:31.508 --> 31:32.810
It's not fair that...

31:33.242 --> 31:34.927
Stop. I'll meet you.

31:35.177 --> 31:36.105
At the park on Harvard.

31:36.512 --> 31:37.596
3:00.

31:37.846 --> 31:39.400
Okay, c-could we, uh...

31:41.050 --> 31:42.568
He hung up.

31:42.944 --> 31:44.370
Okay.

31:44.620 --> 31:45.989
Let's get you wired.

31:46.422 --> 31:48.742
Just get him to say
as much as you can.

31:49.125 --> 31:51.495
And as soon as you get him
to admit that he paid you,

31:52.360 --> 31:54.206
that money exchanged
hands, we've got him.

31:54.662 --> 31:55.580
Okay?

31:55.830 --> 31:56.875
Money exchanged. Okay.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.001
- Got it.
- Yeah. All right?

31:58.433 --> 31:59.350
Yes. Okay, where's the...

31:59.600 --> 32:00.518
the mic again?

32:00.768 --> 32:01.755
Don't...
don't touch it.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.055
It's right here. Look.

32:03.305 --> 32:04.222
Okay.
See that?

32:04.472 --> 32:05.509
Yeah, yeah. It's gonna be find.

32:05.941 --> 32:06.792
- Okay?
- Yes, yes.

32:07.042 --> 32:07.678
- All right.
- Got it, got it.

32:08.108 --> 32:08.762
Should I, like, lean into him

32:09.209 --> 32:09.888
- so he...
- No.

32:10.344 --> 32:10.723
No.

32:11.178 --> 32:12.641
- No. No.
- Sorry.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.810
That's okay. It's understandable.

32:15.249 --> 32:16.729
Just be yourself, and be natural.

32:17.184 --> 32:18.397
The conversation

32:18.852 --> 32:19.732
is gonna go great.

32:20.187 --> 32:21.105
I got it. I just...

32:21.355 --> 32:22.735
I'm rattling man, you know?

32:23.190 --> 32:24.862
Damn it.
He's crashing.

32:25.291 --> 32:27.573
Just, you know, if I...

32:27.823 --> 32:30.284
If I could just get a, uh,
quick taste,

32:30.729 --> 32:31.647
I'd be a lot better.

32:31.897 --> 32:32.882
I could do this.

32:33.132 --> 32:34.417
Are you asking us for heroin?

32:34.667 --> 32:35.685
Yeah.

32:35.935 --> 32:37.458
In a police station?

32:40.305 --> 32:41.920
Let's see what we can do, okay?

32:42.374 --> 32:43.380
Okay.

32:43.808 --> 32:45.309
All right.

32:47.379 --> 32:49.431
Maybe we should call it off;
he's falling apart.

32:49.681 --> 32:51.566
He's our best chance to get Wilson.

32:51.816 --> 32:53.515
Without him, we got nothing.

32:53.765 --> 32:55.437
Look, he's desperate.

32:55.687 --> 32:57.638
He's gonna come across as desperate,

32:57.888 --> 32:59.741
and that works in our favor.

32:59.991 --> 33:01.475
He knows what's at stake.

33:01.725 --> 33:03.650
He can do it.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.528
You think?

33:07.531 --> 33:10.031
I hope so.

33:28.617 --> 33:30.770
Why is he looking at us?

33:31.178 --> 33:33.680
He's not. He's just looking
this way; it's fine.

33:36.125 --> 33:37.351
State your business
and do it quickly.

33:37.792 --> 33:40.562
I want more money.

33:40.996 --> 33:43.315
How much money do you want?

33:43.765 --> 33:44.942
I, uh...

33:47.535 --> 33:48.552
Come on.

33:48.802 --> 33:50.288
10,000, 20,000...
doesn't matter.

33:50.538 --> 33:51.949
Just say anything.

33:53.374 --> 33:54.868
More.

33:55.309 --> 33:56.360
You said that already.

33:56.610 --> 33:57.246
It's not fair.

33:57.678 --> 33:58.372
I took all the risks.

33:58.812 --> 34:00.707
Your pupils are tiny.
Are you high?

34:01.148 --> 34:02.632
- No!
- That's why you want money.

34:02.882 --> 34:03.627
For more drugs.

34:04.051 --> 34:05.836
No, I want you to admit
that you used me.

34:06.086 --> 34:07.404
What is this? Who are you looking at?

34:07.654 --> 34:08.674
Are you wearing a wire?

34:09.121 --> 34:12.136
What do you think, I'm some
kind of narc or something?!

34:12.559 --> 34:14.679
I think you're a very
troubled young man.

34:15.128 --> 34:16.139
Everyone stay where you are.

34:16.562 --> 34:17.641
We got nothing.

34:18.063 --> 34:19.768
You know what?
You know what I think?!

34:20.331 --> 34:21.895
I think you're trying
to pin this on me.

34:22.333 --> 34:24.188
Yeah, I think you want
me to go down with this.

34:24.636 --> 34:26.222
Yeah, make me the fall guy,

34:26.472 --> 34:27.484
Have you lost your mind?

34:27.906 --> 34:28.657
I bet you're wearing a wire.

34:28.907 --> 34:29.445
- Come on.
- Stop it.

34:29.875 --> 34:30.960
- Stop it!
- No! Come on.

34:31.210 --> 34:33.460
You keep this up and we're both
going to end up in jail.

34:33.710 --> 34:35.197
You should have thought about
that before you hired me!

34:35.447 --> 34:36.201
I never would've hired you

34:36.647 --> 34:38.036
if I had known you were
a complete and total junkie.

34:38.483 --> 34:39.433
Okay, we got him.

34:39.683 --> 34:40.246
Let's go.

34:40.684 --> 34:42.248
- No more!
- I want more!

34:50.694 --> 34:52.176
Stop!

34:52.596 --> 34:53.696
Stop! Police!

34:55.130 --> 34:55.915
Give me your hands.

34:56.165 --> 34:57.139
I was accosted by that man.

34:57.567 --> 34:59.308
I didn't know you were the police.

34:59.735 --> 35:00.820
I thought you were with that junkie.

35:01.070 --> 35:02.019
Yeah, I'm sure.

35:02.269 --> 35:03.223
That's what I thought you were.

35:03.473 --> 35:04.980
I didn't realize you were the police.

35:12.880 --> 35:14.380
Emma.

35:16.918 --> 35:18.670
What you said the other day...

35:18.920 --> 35:22.307
I can't get it out of my head.

35:22.557 --> 35:24.249
You're right.

35:24.959 --> 35:26.893
I don't want to give up this baby.

35:27.928 --> 35:30.005
Sweetie, come here.

35:39.985 --> 35:42.654
So what did they say?

35:44.394 --> 35:46.508
At first, they really
seemed like they understood,

35:46.758 --> 35:47.943
like they were actually listening

35:48.193 --> 35:50.079
that I wanted to do this.

35:50.525 --> 35:51.747
But as more time went on,

35:51.997 --> 35:54.916
they just were trying
to change my mind.

35:55.166 --> 35:57.286
I told them to stop, and...

35:57.741 --> 36:00.744
that's when they freaked out.

36:06.411 --> 36:07.663
Lemon and honey.

36:08.126 --> 36:09.580
How'd you know?

36:14.132 --> 36:16.103
So you just walked out?

36:16.551 --> 36:19.774
They didn't give me any choice.

36:20.024 --> 36:23.844
They pulled the whole
"not under our roof" thing.

36:24.309 --> 36:26.879
I had to get out of there.

36:27.354 --> 36:28.939
Before I knew it, I was here.

36:29.189 --> 36:31.451
All right,
I think you should call them.

36:31.900 --> 36:33.200
Why?

36:33.902 --> 36:35.654
It's not like they tried to stop me.

36:35.904 --> 36:36.989
They don't know where you are,

36:37.239 --> 36:39.559
and I am sure
they're worried about you.

36:40.033 --> 36:41.260
And they're probably trying
to figure it out themselves.

36:41.510 --> 36:42.703
You know, they had
certain expectations

36:42.953 --> 36:45.331
that they have to readjust.

36:45.872 --> 36:48.334
It's gonna take some time,
Emma, but they love you and...

36:48.792 --> 36:49.835
they'll come around.

36:50.085 --> 36:51.670
I hope so.

36:52.020 --> 36:53.439
Because I don't know
where we're gonna live,

36:53.689 --> 36:54.798
what we're gonna eat.

36:55.048 --> 36:57.643
I mean, I don't even know
my insurance.

36:58.093 --> 36:59.344
It's gonna be okay.

37:00.053 --> 37:01.512
Yeah.
We meant what we said.

37:01.972 --> 37:04.014
Whatever you need,

37:04.474 --> 37:06.884
we're here for you.

37:07.352 --> 37:08.285
Really?

37:08.535 --> 37:09.897
Really.

37:12.649 --> 37:15.225
Meanwhile, can I make you
breakfast or...?

37:15.694 --> 37:18.428
Could I take a bath?

37:18.905 --> 37:20.405
Yeah.

37:33.959 --> 37:35.711
So I just talked to Emma's father.

37:35.961 --> 37:36.712
And?

37:37.174 --> 37:37.946
And he's angry.

37:38.196 --> 37:39.259
Very angry.

37:39.509 --> 37:40.683
At Emma?

37:40.933 --> 37:41.851
No, at us.

37:42.304 --> 37:43.386
For changing his daughter's mind.

37:43.636 --> 37:45.599
He says we are taking
advantage of her,

37:45.849 --> 37:47.188
we're manipulating her.

37:47.643 --> 37:48.356
That's crazy.

37:48.606 --> 37:49.770
Coming from a guy who's trying

37:50.020 --> 37:51.926
to make her give up
her baby, you know.

37:52.397 --> 37:55.530
He's not gonna, like,
kick her out of the house?

37:55.984 --> 37:57.365
He's bringing a suitcase over.

37:57.615 --> 38:00.134
He's... they're trying to scare her.

38:00.384 --> 38:02.866
Yeah, well, it's working.

38:11.427 --> 38:12.746
Did I make a mistake?

38:13.210 --> 38:15.254
I mean, we've got somebody else's kid

38:15.799 --> 38:17.317
upstairs in our bathroom.

38:17.798 --> 38:19.318
You listen to me.

38:19.568 --> 38:23.055
You are the only person that
realized what she really wanted.

38:23.305 --> 38:24.972
I missed it, her parents missed it.

38:25.222 --> 38:27.226
So don't beat yourself up over this.

38:27.683 --> 38:29.977
I don't know how this is
gonna play out, but right now,

38:30.345 --> 38:32.264
she's exactly where she needs to be.

38:32.729 --> 38:35.232
What about us?

38:41.863 --> 38:44.867
Maybe we're where
we're meant to be, too.

38:46.895 --> 38:50.038
I'm gonna call the movers,
get our stuff back,

38:50.665 --> 38:52.316
and you got to call work.

38:52.791 --> 38:54.585
Are you sure?

38:55.043 --> 38:55.961
Yeah.

38:59.589 --> 39:00.891
We're supposed to be watching
the game at O'Malley's tonight

39:01.141 --> 39:02.134
with a bunch of the guys.

39:02.384 --> 39:04.470
So I'll talk to the captain then.

39:04.720 --> 39:07.264
About tonight.

39:09.266 --> 39:11.268
Surprise!

39:26.965 --> 39:28.065
Hi.

39:28.744 --> 39:30.644
Thanks.

39:31.663 --> 39:33.163
Yeah.

39:37.308 --> 39:38.393
Give me a hug.

39:38.643 --> 39:39.794
Captain.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.562
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

39:41.812 --> 39:44.331
So, well, your partner
sure throws a great party.

39:44.801 --> 39:46.100
Yeah, I wish he was half
as good a detective.

39:46.350 --> 39:47.262
Okay, all right.

39:47.684 --> 39:49.737
Can I get a minute
alone with the captain?

39:50.223 --> 39:51.225
Yeah, cool. I'll go check on Hannah.

39:51.475 --> 39:53.107
All right, thanks.

39:53.357 --> 39:54.590
What's up?

39:56.726 --> 39:59.728
I know this is gonna
sound kind of crazy.

40:02.966 --> 40:04.696
I'm not leaving.

40:06.569 --> 40:07.587
What?

40:07.837 --> 40:09.923
Some personal stuff came up.

40:10.173 --> 40:12.558
Me and Hannah.

40:13.038 --> 40:15.160
And I'm gonna stay.

40:15.410 --> 40:17.630
Wait, I'm-I'm confused.

40:17.880 --> 40:19.169
Personal stuff...?

40:19.419 --> 40:24.202
Before he died,
Rex got his girlfriend pregnant.

40:24.675 --> 40:27.238
And turns out, she's
having the-the...

40:27.719 --> 40:30.806
Well, we're gonna be grandparents.

40:37.198 --> 40:38.449
That is amazing.

40:38.699 --> 40:40.941
I know. Right?

40:41.702 --> 40:43.787
I mean, it's weird.

40:44.569 --> 40:47.572
So you're not gonna be
leaving anytimee soon?

40:50.844 --> 40:52.429
Not planning on it.

40:52.679 --> 40:54.997
I mean, we're taking it
day by day, but...

40:57.124 --> 40:58.500
Hope that's okay with you.

41:01.020 --> 41:02.171
Of course.

41:11.029 --> 41:12.779
Think I better tell them.

41:17.853 --> 41:19.320
I saw Vega welling up

41:19.813 --> 41:21.389
when you said you were gonna stay.

41:21.639 --> 41:23.057
He was so drunk by the end,

41:23.307 --> 41:25.861
he would've cried if I told hi
I liked his hair.

41:27.377 --> 41:28.428
You're up.

41:28.905 --> 41:30.324
Did you guys have fun?

41:30.574 --> 41:32.066
Yeah. How was your night in?

41:32.534 --> 41:34.602
First, I was bored out of my mind,

41:34.995 --> 41:36.937
but then this X Files marathon
came on.

41:37.414 --> 41:39.205
Have you guys seen this show?

41:39.455 --> 41:40.640
Yeah, I-I taped them.

41:41.126 --> 41:42.408
It's messed up.

41:42.878 --> 41:44.744
You want a plate for your pizza?

41:45.213 --> 41:47.174
I'm good.

41:50.266 --> 41:51.929
Okay, don't stay up too late.

41:52.179 --> 41:54.056
I won't. I just want
to watch one more.

41:54.306 --> 41:55.349
All right.

41:57.601 --> 42:00.959
Do you guys want to watch with me?

42:01.438 --> 42:03.774
Kind of freaks me out.

42:07.082 --> 42:08.582
Sure.

42:14.054 --> 42:15.119
This good?

42:25.807 --> 42:26.558
I know this one.

42:26.808 --> 42:27.840
Yeah?...

42:28.809 --> 42:30.175
It's good.
