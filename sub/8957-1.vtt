00:32.500 --> 00:36.254
Okay, game point. 15-14.
This team serves.

00:36.421 --> 00:38.465
Let's go. Service!

00:38.631 --> 00:40.091
Come on! Come on!

00:44.889 --> 00:48.976
Keep it up! Let's go!
Teamwork! Keep playing!

00:51.937 --> 00:56.317
- Hit it to Carrie! She'll blow it!
- Don't blow it, Carrie! Hit it!

00:58.319 --> 01:00.405
- Carrie...!
- She blew it again!

01:00.572 --> 01:05.285
- We almost had the game!
- We can't win with her on the team.

01:05.452 --> 01:08.121
Look at her! Just standing there!

01:08.205 --> 01:10.582
You eat shit!

04:37.967 --> 04:40.304
Help me! Help me!

04:40.429 --> 04:42.389
Help me!

04:42.514 --> 04:44.558
Aah!

04:44.725 --> 04:46.560
Help me! Help me!

04:46.685 --> 04:48.729
Have a Tampax!

04:48.979 --> 04:50.064
Help me!

04:54.234 --> 04:56.529
Help me! Help me!

04:58.573 --> 05:00.116
Help me!

05:01.284 --> 05:03.286
Gross! Gross!

05:05.413 --> 05:09.292
Carrie! Here! Plug it up! Plug it up!

05:11.836 --> 05:13.380
Plug it up! Plug it up!

05:13.630 --> 05:15.966
Plug it up! Plug it up!

05:16.175 --> 05:18.511
Plug it up! Plug it up!

05:18.719 --> 05:20.763
Plug it up! Plug it up!

05:21.055 --> 05:24.058
Plug it up! Plug it up!

05:24.183 --> 05:26.185
What's happening?

05:26.310 --> 05:29.772
Plug it up! Plug it up!

05:30.022 --> 05:31.357
Plug it up! Plug it up!

05:31.607 --> 05:33.026
Plug it up! Plug it up!

05:33.151 --> 05:37.739
- Sue! What are you doing?!
- Carrie... she just got her period!

05:37.864 --> 05:40.033
- Who's got her period?
- Carrie.

05:40.158 --> 05:41.576
What are you doing?!

05:41.743 --> 05:43.495
Plug it up! Plug it up!

05:43.662 --> 05:45.497
Plug it up! Plug it up!

05:45.664 --> 05:47.374
Plug it up! Plug it up!

05:47.541 --> 05:50.210
Carrie! Come on, Carrie!

05:50.335 --> 05:52.296
Carrie, quit it! Come on!

05:52.422 --> 05:55.800
Stop it! Now relax! Calm down.
Listen to me.

05:56.050 --> 06:01.013
It's okay. It's okay. Just stand up
and take care of yourself. Come on.

06:01.139 --> 06:04.392
Grow up. Stand up and take care
of yourself. Come on, do it. Do it.

06:04.517 --> 06:05.518
- Do it!
- Aah!

06:08.146 --> 06:09.565
Did you see that?

06:09.732 --> 06:12.067
No...!

06:13.277 --> 06:16.238
Get out of here. Go on. Right now. Move!

06:20.951 --> 06:21.994
Carrie...

06:25.706 --> 06:30.754
Carrie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't know, okay? I'm sorry.

06:30.879 --> 06:33.923
Baby, come on, now. Don't you know?

06:34.090 --> 06:39.179
I'm gonna talk to you about it.
Now just calm down. Just relax.

06:39.304 --> 06:42.474
See? They're all gone. They're all gone.

06:42.599 --> 06:44.726
It's gonna be okay.

06:59.200 --> 07:03.663
- Isn't she a bit old for her, uh...
- Her first period.

07:03.830 --> 07:05.624
Um... yes.

07:07.584 --> 07:14.257
Morty, until a half-hour ago, I don't even
think she knew there was such a thing.

07:14.424 --> 07:17.219
It's really... hard to believe

07:17.386 --> 07:20.347
a girl in high school
wouldn't know something.

07:20.472 --> 07:22.475
Uh, facts...

07:22.600 --> 07:24.143
Well, she didn't.

07:24.268 --> 07:27.814
But I don't know why that should
surprise us, knowing that mother of hers.

07:27.939 --> 07:32.402
- We can't interfere with people's beliefs.
- I know, I know.

07:32.568 --> 07:35.446
- As for the girls...
- Carrie's always been their scapegoat.

07:35.571 --> 07:38.658
- You've got to do something.
- I will.

07:39.283 --> 07:42.162
But see, the thing is, Morty, that, um...

07:42.287 --> 07:44.289
I knew how they felt.

07:44.456 --> 07:49.837
The whole thing just made me
wanna take her and shake her, too.

07:49.962 --> 07:54.717
- It was just her period, for God sake!
- Well, we'll send her home.

07:54.883 --> 07:58.011
Miss Finch,
will you send in Cassie Wright?

07:58.179 --> 08:00.181
It's Carrie White.

08:04.602 --> 08:06.229
Come in, Cassie.

08:06.354 --> 08:08.148
Carrie.

08:08.273 --> 08:11.234
Miss Finch, would you
bring in a dismissal slip?

08:12.652 --> 08:15.613
I thought you might take
the rest of the day

08:15.739 --> 08:18.409
and go home,
take care of yourself, Cassie.

08:22.747 --> 08:25.750
We're all very sorry about this incident.

08:31.922 --> 08:33.466
It's Carrie.

08:36.219 --> 08:38.346
Thank you.

08:42.517 --> 08:47.689
- Would you like to go to the infirmary?
- I think Carrie can go home.

08:52.027 --> 08:56.282
Would you like a ride?
We could call you a cab.

08:56.449 --> 08:58.618
I'm sure she can walk home.

08:58.743 --> 09:03.873
And, Carrie, you're dismissed from gym
for a week. Just take study hall instead.

09:05.374 --> 09:08.169
We're all sorry about this, Cassie.

09:08.336 --> 09:09.379
It's Carrie!

09:37.992 --> 09:41.162
Creepy Carrie! Creepy Carrie! Ha-ha!

09:41.287 --> 09:42.455
Ohh!

09:42.622 --> 09:44.958
Ohh! Ohh...

09:59.098 --> 10:01.642
Were you in Chicago two years ago?

10:01.767 --> 10:03.018
Chicago?

10:03.144 --> 10:06.064
Yes, Bill. Chicago.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.692
Why, yes, I was living in Chicago.

10:08.817 --> 10:13.321
- You knew that. I told you that, didn't l?
- No, you didn't. I found out.

10:13.447 --> 10:16.616
You're looking at me so, uh, strangely...

10:17.159 --> 10:18.952
Oh, Mrs White.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.455
- How have you been, Mrs Snell?
- Fine.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.000
- And the doctor?
- Fine.

10:24.167 --> 10:27.795
- And your daughter?
- Sue is fine.

10:29.797 --> 10:33.384
- Won't you come in, Mrs White?
- Oh, how kind of you.

10:37.430 --> 10:41.350
- Carrie is in some of Sue's classes.
- Yes.

10:41.476 --> 10:46.857
- Perhaps sometime she might like to visit.
- I'm here on the Lord's work, Mrs Snell.

10:46.982 --> 10:51.361
Spreadin' the gospel of God's salvation
through Christ's blood.

10:51.445 --> 10:52.696
Yes, of course.

10:52.821 --> 10:56.742
I have something here I know is gonna
interest the doctor and you.

10:56.867 --> 11:00.872
The teenager's path to salvation
through the cross of Jesus.

11:00.955 --> 11:03.583
I don't think Sue would be very interested.

11:03.708 --> 11:07.796
The children are wandering through the
wilderness of sin these days, Mrs Snell.

11:07.921 --> 11:10.048
My Sue is a good girl.

11:10.173 --> 11:12.300
These are godless times, Mrs Snell.

11:12.425 --> 11:14.427
I'll drink to that!

11:14.511 --> 11:16.471
We'll... all read these.

11:17.931 --> 11:20.393
Excuse me. Please sit down, Mrs White.

11:23.062 --> 11:24.730
Hello?

11:24.897 --> 11:29.026
Betty, can I call you back?
Margaret White is here.

11:29.110 --> 11:31.153
Are you accusing me...

11:31.278 --> 11:32.196
White.

11:32.321 --> 11:35.616
Just let me get rid of her
and I'll call you back.

11:39.246 --> 11:42.082
And now... I'm going to kill you!

11:42.249 --> 11:46.503
I have something here, Mrs Snell,
that I think you might profit from.

11:46.628 --> 11:50.715
- Look, Mrs White, I'd like to contribute 5...
- Exodus.

11:50.882 --> 11:52.634
$10.

11:54.804 --> 11:56.514
I see.

12:11.571 --> 12:14.491
I pray you find Jesus.

12:21.039 --> 12:25.502
- Wasn't that Carrie White's mother?
- Hey, I didn't hear you come in.

12:25.627 --> 12:27.254
What did she want?

13:10.342 --> 13:11.927
Yes?

13:14.012 --> 13:15.555
Yes?

13:33.199 --> 13:34.992
Thank you.

13:40.873 --> 13:42.875
I know you're listening.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.337
Come on downstairs.

14:02.647 --> 14:04.649
Mama?

14:04.816 --> 14:07.485
Who was that? Who called?

14:16.786 --> 14:18.788
You're a woman now.

14:18.913 --> 14:22.042
Why didn't you tell me, Mama?

14:22.168 --> 14:23.127
Aah!

14:25.504 --> 14:28.549
And God made Eve
from the rib of Adam

14:28.674 --> 14:31.927
and Eve was weak and
loosed the raven on the world.

14:32.094 --> 14:34.889
And the raven was called sin. Say it.

14:35.055 --> 14:37.725
Why didn't you tell me, Mama?

14:37.850 --> 14:39.728
- Say it.
- No.

14:39.853 --> 14:41.104
The raven was called sin.

14:41.271 --> 14:43.857
No, Mama... And the raven was called sin!

14:44.024 --> 14:47.277
And the first sin was intercourse.

14:47.444 --> 14:48.945
First sin was intercourse.

14:49.112 --> 14:50.447
I didn't sin, Mama.

14:50.614 --> 14:53.116
- Say it!
- I didn't sin, Mama!

14:53.241 --> 14:54.326
The first sin was intercourse.

14:54.451 --> 14:55.535
First sin was intercourse.

14:55.786 --> 14:56.788
First sin was intercourse.

14:56.954 --> 14:58.456
And the first sin was intercourse!

14:58.623 --> 15:03.544
I was so scared, I thought I was dyin'.
The girls, they all laughed at me, Mama.

15:03.669 --> 15:05.588
- And Eve was weak. Say it.
- No, Mama!

15:05.713 --> 15:07.298
- Eve was weak.
- No!

15:07.423 --> 15:09.008
- Eve was weak.
- No!

15:09.133 --> 15:11.219
- Eve was weak. Say it, woman.
- No, Mama!

15:11.344 --> 15:12.261
Say it!

15:12.386 --> 15:13.596
Eve was weak!

15:13.846 --> 15:15.099
Eve was weak!

15:15.265 --> 15:18.560
And the Lord visited Eve with a curse.

15:18.727 --> 15:21.480
And the curse was the curse of blood!

15:21.647 --> 15:25.442
You should have told me, Mama!
You should have told me!

15:25.567 --> 15:26.652
O Lord!

15:26.777 --> 15:31.031
Help the sinning woman
see the sin of her days and ways.

15:31.156 --> 15:36.079
Show her that if she had remained sinless
the curse of blood would not be on her.

15:36.246 --> 15:40.708
She may be tempted by the Antichrist.
She may have had lustful thoughts...

15:40.834 --> 15:41.793
No, Mama!

15:41.960 --> 15:45.130
Don't lie, Carrietta!
Don't you know I can see inside you?

15:45.296 --> 15:47.257
I can see the sin as surely as God can!

15:47.424 --> 15:49.509
- Let me go, Mama.
- We'll pray!

15:49.634 --> 15:51.387
- We'll pray, woman!
- No!

15:51.512 --> 15:54.223
Pray to Jesus for all the lustful,
sinning souls.

15:54.348 --> 15:55.141
No!

15:55.266 --> 15:58.727
God visited Eve with the curse.
And the curse was the curse of blood.

15:58.853 --> 15:59.812
No, Mama!

15:59.937 --> 16:04.191
And he visited Eve with the second curse.
And this was the curse of childbearing.

16:04.316 --> 16:07.153
And Eve brought forth Cain
in sweat and blood.

16:07.319 --> 16:08.779
Genesis 3:16!

16:08.904 --> 16:11.199
Mama! Let me out!

16:11.324 --> 16:13.577
Mama, please! Let me out!

16:13.702 --> 16:15.412
Mama, please!

16:15.579 --> 16:18.331
Let me out, Mama! God...!

16:34.182 --> 16:37.852
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

16:37.977 --> 16:39.353
Thy kingdom...

17:04.297 --> 17:06.299
Thank you, Mama.

17:11.471 --> 17:13.890
You can go to bed now.

17:48.885 --> 17:53.807
There is power, power,
wonder-working power in the blood

17:53.974 --> 17:55.642
of the lamb...

18:02.692 --> 18:04.694
Carrie?

18:05.069 --> 18:07.113
Carrie?

18:11.576 --> 18:13.161
Carrie?

18:17.875 --> 18:19.585
Carrie?

18:19.752 --> 18:21.128
Carrie?

18:21.295 --> 18:23.130
Open the door.

18:23.255 --> 18:25.382
It's open, Mama.

18:35.018 --> 18:37.020
What was that noise?

18:38.146 --> 18:39.981
What noise?

18:43.860 --> 18:45.445
Go to bed.

18:45.612 --> 18:48.698
Yes, ma'am. Saying my prayers...

19:07.635 --> 19:12.682
"What are you going to leave
for us, you people in your big cars,

19:12.849 --> 19:15.727
spewing pollution into the air?"

19:18.021 --> 19:21.024
"You people with heavy feet,

19:21.191 --> 19:23.693
trampling down the wilderness."

19:25.320 --> 19:29.826
"You people who peer into
the back seats of our cars,

19:29.992 --> 19:34.914
hours after you come out
of the back doors of your motels."

19:36.457 --> 19:41.796
"Soon all we will have is each other."

19:41.921 --> 19:44.924
"And that could be enough."

19:45.049 --> 19:47.761
"If you will let us have room enough

19:47.928 --> 19:50.097
and air enough

19:50.222 --> 19:52.474
and peace enough

19:52.641 --> 19:55.352
to love each other

19:55.477 --> 19:58.647
as you never could."

19:58.814 --> 19:59.773
Hm.

19:59.898 --> 20:03.527
I... I really must say... I must confess

20:03.694 --> 20:08.450
this poem displays
the most extraordinary talent.

20:11.745 --> 20:15.540
Talent extraordinary for you,
Tommy Ross.

20:17.333 --> 20:18.710
You know, Tommy,

20:18.835 --> 20:22.964
this is slightly different from running
touchdowns and hitting home runs.

20:26.177 --> 20:27.511
Class,

20:27.636 --> 20:29.638
any criticisms?

20:33.476 --> 20:34.810
Anyone?

20:36.353 --> 20:38.147
It's beautiful.

20:43.570 --> 20:46.281
Carrie White!

20:46.406 --> 20:47.491
Beautiful.

20:48.658 --> 20:50.660
Beautiful.

20:51.369 --> 20:53.163
Beautiful!

20:55.624 --> 20:58.668
"Oh, beautiful for spacious skies,

20:58.835 --> 21:01.672
for amber waves of grain" !

21:01.798 --> 21:06.302
Is that the beautiful you mean?
Is it, Carrie, hmm?

21:06.385 --> 21:09.764
Well, Carrie, this is hardly a criticism.

21:09.931 --> 21:11.557
You suck.

21:11.724 --> 21:16.395
Tommy, did you say something, Tommy?

21:16.562 --> 21:19.233
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

21:19.358 --> 21:22.111
I said "Aw, shucks."

21:29.952 --> 21:31.787
Roll call: Blake.

21:31.912 --> 21:32.454
Present.

21:32.579 --> 21:33.497
- Borne.
- Here.

21:33.622 --> 21:34.540
- Gogin.
- Present.

21:34.665 --> 21:36.375
- Grace.
- Here.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.002
- Hargenson.
- Here.

21:38.128 --> 21:39.337
- Litton.
- Yeah.

21:39.504 --> 21:40.797
- MacDermit.
- Present.

21:40.922 --> 21:42.590
- O'Shea.
- Present.

21:42.715 --> 21:44.092
- Pollock.
- Here.

21:44.217 --> 21:45.718
- Shires.
- Present.

21:45.844 --> 21:47.011
- Snell.
- Here.

21:47.137 --> 21:48.388
- Watson.
- Present.

21:48.555 --> 21:50.515
- And the Wilsons.
- We're here.

21:50.640 --> 21:51.599
Okay, line up.

21:53.309 --> 21:54.477
Line up!

21:55.729 --> 21:57.148
Move it!

21:59.442 --> 22:02.987
On your feet right now! Two lines!

22:05.406 --> 22:09.034
Alice and Mary, eyes front.

22:09.201 --> 22:10.786
Katie...

22:13.123 --> 22:15.167
You, too, Chris.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.794
And spit out that gum.

22:17.961 --> 22:21.590
- Where'll I put it, Miss Collins?
- You can choke on it for all I care.

22:21.715 --> 22:24.050
Just get it out of your mouth.

22:36.814 --> 22:39.734
Wipe that smirk off your face, Norma.

22:42.320 --> 22:47.825
Okay. Now I want you all to know that
you did a really shitty thing yesterday,

22:47.950 --> 22:49.536
a really shitty thing.

22:53.999 --> 22:58.462
Did any of you ever stop to think
that Carrie White has feelings?

23:00.089 --> 23:03.133
Do any of you ever stop to think?

23:06.428 --> 23:10.308
No, I guess you're too busy
thinking about your dates

23:10.433 --> 23:12.393
and the prom.

23:14.479 --> 23:20.026
I guess you can take your pick, Chris.
Who's the lucky guy?

23:20.193 --> 23:21.694
Billy Nolan.

23:21.820 --> 23:24.697
- Who?
- Billy Nolan.

23:24.823 --> 23:27.326
- I'm sorry, could you speak up?
- Billy Nolan.

23:27.451 --> 23:29.620
Well, isn't he the lucky one!

23:36.252 --> 23:38.254
What about you, Sue?

23:39.672 --> 23:41.632
Who's taking you?

23:41.757 --> 23:43.300
Tommy Ross.

23:44.386 --> 23:45.679
Right.

23:51.601 --> 23:58.066
Now, my idea for this little trick you pulled
was three days' suspension

23:58.191 --> 24:00.861
and refusal of your prom tickets.

24:01.069 --> 24:01.862
Oh!

24:01.987 --> 24:04.198
What...?

24:04.407 --> 24:06.951
God!

24:07.118 --> 24:10.663
That'd get you where you live, wouldn't it?

24:10.788 --> 24:12.790
And you deserve it.

24:12.957 --> 24:20.089
I don't think any of you have any idea
of just how nasty what you did really was.

24:22.342 --> 24:27.306
But the office has decided
you're to have one week's detention.

24:32.644 --> 24:35.230
Still, there's one little catch.

24:35.355 --> 24:37.483
It's to be my detention.

24:37.649 --> 24:39.903
That's 50 minutes

24:40.028 --> 24:41.404
every day

24:41.529 --> 24:43.156
starting today

24:43.281 --> 24:45.116
on the athletic field.

24:45.283 --> 24:46.743
Get the picture?

24:46.868 --> 24:48.161
I'm not coming.

24:53.958 --> 24:55.960
That's up to you, Chris.

24:57.421 --> 24:59.924
That's up to all of you.

25:00.466 --> 25:03.302
Punishment for skipping detention

25:03.469 --> 25:06.138
is three days' suspension

25:06.263 --> 25:09.266
and refusal of your prom tickets.

25:11.477 --> 25:13.479
Any other thoughts?

25:15.232 --> 25:17.943
Good. Now change up.

25:18.985 --> 25:21.655
Where are you going?

25:22.489 --> 25:25.242
- Where you going?
- Gotta go.

25:25.408 --> 25:28.286
- I'm not coming.
- You're really not gonna come?

25:28.411 --> 25:32.666
- I'm not coming.
- You're gonna miss the prom.

25:32.791 --> 25:34.669
Fuck!

25:34.919 --> 25:36.838
And... 1 , 2, 3, 4.

25:36.963 --> 25:38.923
2, 2, 3, 4.

25:39.048 --> 25:41.050
3, 2, 3, 4.

25:41.217 --> 25:43.094
4, 2, 3, 4.

25:43.219 --> 25:44.053
5, 2...

25:44.178 --> 25:46.055
Energy, Norma! Come on!

25:46.180 --> 25:47.807
8, 2, 3, 4.

25:47.974 --> 25:50.059
1 , 2, 3, 4.

25:50.226 --> 25:52.187
2, 2, 3, 4.

25:52.354 --> 25:53.981
3, 2, 3, 4.

25:54.106 --> 25:56.150
Stretch, 2, 3, 4.

25:56.316 --> 25:57.985
Stretch, 2, 3, 4.

25:58.152 --> 26:00.237
Stretch, Norma, stretch!

26:00.362 --> 26:02.114
Stretch, 2, 3, 4.

26:02.239 --> 26:03.699
1 , 2,

26:03.866 --> 26:05.117
bend, up.

26:05.284 --> 26:06.493
Bend, up.

26:06.660 --> 26:07.911
1 , 2.

26:08.036 --> 26:09.204
1 , 2.

26:09.329 --> 26:10.582
1 , 2.

26:10.748 --> 26:11.833
Faster.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.001
And 1 , 2.

26:13.168 --> 26:14.002
1 , 2.

26:14.169 --> 26:15.587
1 , 2, 1 ,

26:15.712 --> 26:18.173
and 2

26:18.339 --> 26:20.425
and 3

26:20.550 --> 26:21.384
Uhh!

26:21.551 --> 26:23.386
..and 4

26:23.511 --> 26:26.181
and 5

26:26.306 --> 26:28.642
and 6

26:28.809 --> 26:31.353
and 7

26:31.520 --> 26:34.190
and 8

26:34.315 --> 26:36.525
and 9

26:36.692 --> 26:38.611
and 10

26:38.736 --> 26:40.529
and 11

26:40.696 --> 26:42.656
and 12

26:42.823 --> 26:44.700
and 13

26:44.825 --> 26:46.870
and 14

26:47.037 --> 26:48.914
and 15.

27:22.699 --> 27:25.369
1, 2, 1 , 2, 1 , 2, 1 , 2,

27:25.536 --> 27:26.829
1, 2, 1 , 2,

27:26.995 --> 27:28.205
1, 2, 1 , 2.

27:28.330 --> 27:29.581
Get your knees up!

27:29.748 --> 27:30.999
1, 2, 1 , 2,

27:31.166 --> 27:32.417
1, 2, 1 , 2.

27:32.543 --> 27:34.628
Come on, you hotshots!

27:34.795 --> 27:37.673
She can't get away with this.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.842
I'm gonna get her.

27:39.967 --> 27:41.594
Let it go, Chris.

27:42.470 --> 27:44.472
Like hell I will.

27:45.849 --> 27:48.101
1 , 2, 1 , 2, 1 , 2.

27:48.893 --> 27:51.271
The period's not up, Hargenson.

27:51.438 --> 27:54.107
- It is for me.
- Keep running!

27:54.190 --> 27:55.650
There are 10 minutes left.

27:55.817 --> 27:57.819
Stick 'em up your...

28:01.699 --> 28:04.827
You can't hit us!
You'll get canned for this,

28:04.952 --> 28:06.036
you bitch!

28:06.162 --> 28:08.831
One more word and I'll knock you down!

28:08.956 --> 28:13.043
She can't get away with this
if we all stick together, Norma!

28:14.503 --> 28:16.338
Helen?

28:16.505 --> 28:17.466
Sue?!

28:17.632 --> 28:19.301
Shut up, Chris.

28:19.426 --> 28:21.011
Just shut up.

28:22.721 --> 28:24.598
This isn't over.

28:24.764 --> 28:27.058
This isn't over by a long shot!

28:27.225 --> 28:29.936
You're out of the prom, Hargenson.

28:30.979 --> 28:32.981
Okay, the show's over.

28:33.148 --> 28:35.193
In place, run!

28:35.359 --> 28:37.445
1 , 2, 1 , 2, 1 , 2.

29:19.447 --> 29:23.159
Hang 'em high! Hang 'em low!
Come on, Bates, let's go!

29:23.284 --> 29:26.788
Hang 'em high! Hang 'em low!
Come on, Bates, let's go!

29:26.955 --> 29:28.289
- Give me a B!
- B!

29:28.456 --> 29:29.583
- Give me an A!
- A!

29:29.708 --> 29:31.127
- Give me a T!
- T!

29:31.293 --> 29:32.461
- Give me an E!
- E!

29:32.628 --> 29:34.672
- Give me an S!
- S!

29:35.005 --> 29:37.049
Bates! Bates! Yeah!

29:37.258 --> 29:41.804
- Guess who's entering the nationals?
- Are you kidding?

29:41.971 --> 29:43.973
Hey, terrific!

29:44.640 --> 29:46.642
What's up?

29:46.809 --> 29:48.603
Can I talk to you?

29:48.770 --> 29:51.940
- Right now?
- It's real important.

29:52.732 --> 29:54.151
All right.

29:54.276 --> 30:00.157
Tommy, if I asked you to do something
very special for me,

30:00.282 --> 30:02.242
would you do it?

30:02.409 --> 30:04.202
Yeah.

30:05.537 --> 30:08.708
I want you to take Carrie White
to the prom.

30:22.597 --> 30:24.600
How's it looking there?

30:44.579 --> 30:45.997
Ha ha ha!

30:46.122 --> 30:47.248
Freddy!

30:47.373 --> 30:50.752
Wanna go over to Minsky's
for some hard stuff?

30:55.840 --> 30:56.382
No.

30:56.508 --> 30:58.635
- Huh?
- Some other time, huh?

30:58.760 --> 31:01.555
- You pussy!
- Gimme one of them beers!

31:01.680 --> 31:03.891
- Suck on this, huh?
- All right!

31:18.322 --> 31:19.282
Yee-hoo!

31:19.407 --> 31:21.660
- Hey, man!
- Oh, man, those stripes!

31:21.827 --> 31:22.661
Ooh!

31:22.828 --> 31:23.703
Aah!

31:23.829 --> 31:25.330
Yes!

31:30.085 --> 31:31.461
Oh, shit.

31:31.586 --> 31:33.713
Watch it, you stupid shit!

31:44.892 --> 31:46.602
Don't call me that, huh?

31:46.727 --> 31:48.604
Well, look what you did!

31:52.817 --> 31:53.901
Stupid shit.

31:55.571 --> 31:57.739
- I told you not to call me that.
- Look out!

31:57.948 --> 32:00.534
Dumb punk!

32:00.701 --> 32:05.539
- What, are you scared?
- What, do you want to get us killed?

32:08.375 --> 32:10.210
Dumb shit.

32:11.670 --> 32:13.673
You fuck!

32:48.501 --> 32:50.170
Okay, I'll do it.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.519
Take the streets!

33:07.771 --> 33:10.107
Hi, friend! What's up?

33:13.861 --> 33:15.822
Don't be in such a hurry.

33:15.988 --> 33:17.907
Oh.

33:18.032 --> 33:20.034
Come on...

33:20.243 --> 33:22.078
"Don't be in such a hurry."

33:22.245 --> 33:25.414
- I'm hurrying away from you.
- No, you're not.

33:25.540 --> 33:28.585
- Pain right in the ass.
- You don't mean that.

33:28.752 --> 33:30.587
I don't mean that.

33:33.048 --> 33:35.843
You're crazier than a son of a bitch.

33:36.009 --> 33:38.345
Give me everything

33:38.512 --> 33:39.847
Oh,

33:40.013 --> 33:42.057
sweet sigh

33:43.142 --> 33:44.519
Come here.

33:46.646 --> 33:48.565
Oh, shit.

33:50.525 --> 33:51.943
Ooh!

33:59.868 --> 34:01.578
Mmm...

34:02.287 --> 34:03.664
Mm!

34:03.873 --> 34:06.542
Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you!

34:06.709 --> 34:11.297
- Can't you wait a minute?
- Well, what for? We do this all the time.

34:11.464 --> 34:13.466
You're so ignorant.

34:14.717 --> 34:18.888
Yeah, but... that's what
you like about me, right?

34:19.054 --> 34:20.347
I know that.

34:20.514 --> 34:21.850
Shit.

34:22.016 --> 34:22.851
No?

34:23.018 --> 34:23.851
No?

34:24.018 --> 34:26.228
I know what you like about me.

34:26.396 --> 34:27.230
This.

34:27.397 --> 34:28.732
Touch it.

34:28.899 --> 34:29.940
No!

34:32.735 --> 34:34.404
Dumb shit!

34:36.114 --> 34:43.164
I told you never to call me that!
You are totally fucked up! You really are.

34:43.414 --> 34:45.166
I'm convinced.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.378
Billy...

34:52.672 --> 34:54.675
Come here.

34:55.510 --> 34:57.513
Billy... Come on.

35:02.351 --> 35:04.353
Come on.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.861
I want you to do something...

35:14.154 --> 35:16.157
Something important.

35:19.869 --> 35:21.538
Mm-hm?

35:21.663 --> 35:23.248
Billy...

35:26.501 --> 35:28.086
Billy...

35:29.838 --> 35:31.631
Oh, Billy...

35:32.340 --> 35:34.009
Billy...

35:34.176 --> 35:36.011
Oh, Billy...

35:36.846 --> 35:39.807
Oh, Billy... Billy... Oh, Billy...

35:42.852 --> 35:45.813
Oh, Billy, I hate Carrie White.

35:46.480 --> 35:48.107
Who?

36:13.259 --> 36:15.261
Hi, Carrie.

36:16.804 --> 36:18.473
Hi.

36:18.598 --> 36:21.184
- How are you?
- Okay.

36:21.309 --> 36:23.478
Good. Uh...

36:25.062 --> 36:27.023
What are you doing?

36:27.148 --> 36:28.942
Reading.

36:29.234 --> 36:31.528
Yeah? What are you reading?

36:32.571 --> 36:34.573
It's about, uh

36:34.698 --> 36:36.241
sewing.

36:36.366 --> 36:38.368
Sewing. That's good.

36:38.535 --> 36:39.786
Um...

36:39.912 --> 36:42.581
If you don't have a date for the prom
next Friday,

36:42.623 --> 36:45.501
would you like to go with me?

36:45.667 --> 36:51.966
To the prom? It's next Friday. I know
this is late notice, but, uh... Carrie?

36:52.133 --> 36:54.135
Carrie, let...

36:58.765 --> 37:04.020
You guys go on. Practise those drills
from yesterday. I'll be right there.

37:14.281 --> 37:16.283
Carrie?

37:16.450 --> 37:17.868
Carrie.

37:20.412 --> 37:22.456
Carrie, what's the matter?

37:22.582 --> 37:25.293
- What happened?
- Nothin'.

37:25.460 --> 37:27.337
Was it one of the girls?

37:27.462 --> 37:30.298
Did one of the girls do something to you?

37:30.465 --> 37:32.175
No.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.886
Well, what is it, then?

37:35.011 --> 37:37.722
You can trust me. You know that?

37:38.140 --> 37:40.142
Would you tell me?

37:40.225 --> 37:42.645
I got invited to the prom.

37:44.522 --> 37:46.774
That's great! That's fantastic!

37:46.941 --> 37:49.819
So what are you moping around for?

37:50.570 --> 37:52.572
Tommy Ross asked me.

37:52.697 --> 37:54.574
That's even better.

37:54.699 --> 37:59.121
- He's really cute, huh?
- I know who he goes around with.

37:59.246 --> 38:02.666
They're just trying
to trick me again, I know.

38:02.791 --> 38:04.793
Maybe not.

38:05.252 --> 38:08.839
I mean... maybe he really meant it.

38:09.006 --> 38:10.716
Let's think about this, now.

38:10.841 --> 38:14.219
It might be terrific.
You might have a really good time.

38:14.386 --> 38:16.388
Carrie?

38:16.638 --> 38:21.186
Carrie, I wanna talk about this attitude
you have about yourself.

38:21.311 --> 38:25.815
You're always walking around
with your hair down, all moping around.

38:25.940 --> 38:27.609
Carrie?

38:27.734 --> 38:29.736
Come here, you big silly.

38:29.861 --> 38:33.031
I want you to look at yourself.

38:35.074 --> 38:37.077
Would you look at that?

38:37.786 --> 38:39.371
Come on.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.042
Now that's a pretty girl.

38:43.209 --> 38:45.211
Look at your eyes!

38:45.336 --> 38:48.589
Little mascara to bring it out? Little?

38:48.756 --> 38:52.927
Your lips. Try some lipstick.
You have nice, pretty lips.

38:53.052 --> 38:54.888
And your cheekbones.

38:55.055 --> 39:00.393
Look at your hair. It's beautiful hair. You
could just put it up a little, add a little curl.

39:00.519 --> 39:02.354
What do you think?

39:02.521 --> 39:04.397
Yeah!

39:06.233 --> 39:07.901
Well?

39:08.026 --> 39:10.028
Well, what do you wanna know?

39:10.153 --> 39:12.657
Why Tommy asked her to the prom.

39:13.991 --> 39:15.368
Well?

39:15.535 --> 39:17.537
I asked him to.

39:18.496 --> 39:20.331
Why?

39:20.832 --> 39:22.625
What for?

39:23.167 --> 39:26.003
What could you possibly
have had in mind?

39:26.170 --> 39:32.177
I thought it would be a good thing for
Carrie, to join in and be with people...

39:32.302 --> 39:35.013
- Make her a part of things?
- Right.

39:35.097 --> 39:37.099
Come on, Sue.

39:37.641 --> 39:39.643
We're not that stupid.

39:39.768 --> 39:43.730
- Neither is Carrie.
- That means... I don't know.

39:43.897 --> 39:48.820
You mean you're not gonna go.
Stay home and miss your own prom?

39:48.987 --> 39:51.406
Come in.

39:52.365 --> 39:55.368
- What is it?
- The attendance sheets, Miss Collins.

39:55.493 --> 39:57.704
You know you can't go without a date.

40:01.666 --> 40:03.668
Is there anything else, Norma?

40:03.793 --> 40:06.129
- No, Miss Collins.
- Thank you, Norma.

40:10.634 --> 40:12.678
Which brings us to you.

40:12.845 --> 40:15.973
- I have to get to practice.
- Well, that's too bad.

40:16.098 --> 40:20.811
- If you don't mind, it's between Sue and l.
- But I do mind... unless, of course,

40:20.936 --> 40:25.025
you'd like to continue this little
discussion in Mr Morton's office.

40:25.150 --> 40:27.152
What is the big deal?!

40:27.277 --> 40:31.865
Because it is a very big deal
for Carrie White, and you know it.

40:31.990 --> 40:33.950
She already said no, anyway.

40:34.075 --> 40:37.454
- Yeah, well, you can change that.
- Don't count your chickens.

40:37.579 --> 40:40.624
- Just don't try...
- Fine. I won't try.

40:40.749 --> 40:43.252
Wait a second! It's not fine!

40:43.377 --> 40:47.423
You can't order someone
not to take someone to the prom!

40:47.590 --> 40:51.010
I can make sure you don't hurt
Carrie White any more.

40:51.135 --> 40:55.181
We're not trying to hurt her, Miss Collins.
We're trying to help her!

40:55.348 --> 40:57.350
How?!

41:02.981 --> 41:07.319
Hey, Tommy, um... Don't you think
you'll look a little ridiculous

41:07.444 --> 41:10.030
when you walk in the prom
with Carrie White?

41:10.155 --> 41:12.741
We don't care how we look.

41:13.992 --> 41:15.994
Do we?

41:21.292 --> 41:23.002
What?

41:23.127 --> 41:24.546
I...

42:19.437 --> 42:21.355
- Hi, Carrie.
- Hi.

42:21.522 --> 42:23.816
So this is where you live, huh?

42:23.983 --> 42:27.862
- What are you doing here?
- You gonna ask me in?

42:28.654 --> 42:30.156
Why not?

42:33.827 --> 42:35.829
Mama's resting.

42:35.954 --> 42:40.876
- What do you want?
- God, right to the point. Um...

42:41.502 --> 42:44.004
- About the prom...
- I already told you.

42:44.129 --> 42:48.258
- But you can change your mind.
- Why are you doing this?

42:48.342 --> 42:50.386
- Cos I want to.
- No, you're not.

42:50.512 --> 42:52.514
I don't do anything I don't want.

42:52.639 --> 42:54.641
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

42:54.766 --> 42:55.850
Carrie!

42:55.934 --> 42:59.479
- You'd better go.
- Not till you say yes.

42:59.562 --> 43:02.023
- No. I can't.
- Yes, you can.

43:02.148 --> 43:04.150
I said I can't.

43:04.275 --> 43:06.277
Carrie!

43:06.361 --> 43:08.322
Yes, you can.

43:08.447 --> 43:11.534
- Will you please go?
- Not till you say yes.

43:11.700 --> 43:13.994
Why is this so important to you?

43:14.119 --> 43:16.831
I don't know.

43:16.997 --> 43:19.834
Maybe because, um... you liked my poem.

43:19.917 --> 43:21.961
Carrie!

43:24.964 --> 43:29.135
- Okay, okay, I'll go.
- Good. I'll pick you up at 8 o'clock.

43:30.971 --> 43:32.556
Okay.

43:35.892 --> 43:37.894
What's the matter, Willie?

43:38.019 --> 43:41.106
We gonna wake up the little piggies?
Oink, oink!

43:41.273 --> 43:44.569
You know, this is a hell of a risk for a joke.

43:44.652 --> 43:50.032
- You want out?
- No, no. It's a good joke. It's a good joke.

43:50.158 --> 43:52.201
Look at this!

43:52.326 --> 43:54.579
- What?
- All these pigs!

43:54.704 --> 43:56.706
What are you talking about?

43:56.873 --> 43:58.875
These painted pigs!

43:59.000 --> 44:02.086
Lauren Hanky's nitwit cousin
painted them.

44:02.253 --> 44:03.422
Shh!

44:03.589 --> 44:07.718
I went out with the girl that posed for 'em.
She was a real pig!

44:07.843 --> 44:10.554
- Will you shut up?!
- Will you let me up there?

44:10.721 --> 44:13.348
You're gonna kill that pig, right?

44:15.100 --> 44:16.643
Piggy!

44:16.727 --> 44:18.770
Here, piggy!

44:18.937 --> 44:21.774
I'm gonna bash your little heads in,

44:21.900 --> 44:25.487
and you don't have to worry
about the bomb no more.

44:25.612 --> 44:29.782
Come here, little piggy!
Come here, you little sucker!

44:29.908 --> 44:34.037
- Will you shut up and do it!
- We gotta give it a chance to burn!

44:34.162 --> 44:36.706
- Oh, yeah?
- Come here, piggy!

44:36.789 --> 44:40.878
You can't do it standin' out here.
Get 'er done, man, get 'er done.

44:40.961 --> 44:44.882
- I can't. I can't. You.
- Oh, I knew this would happen!

44:45.007 --> 44:48.802
- Just... hold it there, you pig. You fuck-up!
- Do it, Billy!

44:48.928 --> 44:51.013
- And you shut up!
- Just do it!

44:51.138 --> 44:56.101
All right, move it out, move it out!
That's it! Come on! Move it out!

44:57.938 --> 44:59.898
Yeah, that's my baby! Yeah!

45:00.023 --> 45:00.565
Do it!

45:01.233 --> 45:01.608
Do it!

45:02.234 --> 45:02.734
Do it!

45:16.666 --> 45:19.919
Carrie, you haven't touched
your apple cake.

45:20.044 --> 45:22.088
Gives me pimples, Mama.

45:22.171 --> 45:25.508
Pimples are the Lord's way
of chastising you.

45:26.342 --> 45:28.386
- Mama?
- Yeah?

45:28.511 --> 45:32.890
Mama, please see that I've gotta
try and get along with people.

45:33.015 --> 45:35.519
What are you going on about, Carrie?

45:36.311 --> 45:38.522
I've been invited to the prom.

45:39.982 --> 45:41.859
The prom?

45:43.110 --> 45:46.446
Yeah, the senior prom. Everybody's goin'.

45:46.613 --> 45:49.867
It's that teacher that called... wasn't it?

45:49.992 --> 45:52.370
Please say I'm not like you, Mama.

45:52.495 --> 45:55.456
I'm funny. All the kids think I'm funny.

45:55.665 --> 45:56.958
I wanna be normal.

45:57.083 --> 46:00.503
I wanna try and be a whole person
before it's too late for...

46:03.590 --> 46:05.592
His name is Tommy Ross.

46:05.717 --> 46:07.218
- He's a very nice boy.
- No.

46:07.343 --> 46:10.556
- He promised to stop in and meet you.
- I said no.

46:10.681 --> 46:14.393
- Mama, I've accepted. I've accepted.
- I said no. No, no, no!

46:14.518 --> 46:15.477
I've accepted!

46:15.603 --> 46:17.855
- Come to your closet.
- No.

46:17.980 --> 46:20.900
- After all you've been taught...
- Everyone isn't bad!

46:21.025 --> 46:23.027
Everything isn't a sin!

46:23.152 --> 46:26.197
Come to your closet and pray.
Ask to be forgiven.

46:26.322 --> 46:30.076
He's a nice boy, Mama. You'll like him.
You'll really like him, Mama.

46:30.202 --> 46:32.037
"Boy."

46:35.040 --> 46:38.001
The boys! The boys! Yes, the boys...

46:38.502 --> 46:41.004
After the blood come the boys....

46:41.129 --> 46:43.673
- Mama...
- Like sniffing dogs,

46:43.798 --> 46:49.305
grinning and slobbering and trying
to find out where that smell comes from.

46:49.430 --> 46:53.518
I know where they take them
cos I've seen it all!

46:53.643 --> 46:56.771
- Well, you're not going.
- Already said I would.

46:56.896 --> 47:00.483
Tell that boy you're not going,
or we're gonna move from here!

47:00.608 --> 47:01.567
No.

47:01.692 --> 47:04.362
We'll move and never see that boy again!

47:04.487 --> 47:08.951
- Mama, please say that Tommy and me...
- I'm gonna close the window.

47:09.076 --> 47:11.453
Mama, please sit and talk to me!

47:21.713 --> 47:23.716
I'm goin', Mama.

47:24.926 --> 47:27.929
And things are gonna change
around here.

47:29.514 --> 47:31.307
Witch.

47:32.225 --> 47:34.227
Got Satan's power.

47:34.394 --> 47:37.063
It's nothin' to do with Satan, Mama.

47:37.188 --> 47:39.607
It's me. Me.

47:39.732 --> 47:43.070
If I concentrate hard enough,
I can move things.

47:43.237 --> 47:46.699
- Satan is clever.
- No, Mama.

47:46.991 --> 47:48.993
I'm not the only one.

47:49.160 --> 47:52.580
Other people can do it. I read about it.

47:52.788 --> 47:58.502
You poor child. He doesn't let you know
he's working through you.

47:58.627 --> 48:01.506
Mama... I know.

48:01.673 --> 48:05.135
He entered your father
and carried him off!

48:05.260 --> 48:08.805
- He ran away, Mama.
- The devil tempted him!

48:08.930 --> 48:11.266
He ran away with a woman, Mama.

48:11.391 --> 48:13.351
Everybody knows that.

48:13.476 --> 48:17.356
You must renounce this power.
You must give it up. Never use it.

48:20.151 --> 48:22.153
I'm goin', Mama.

48:23.487 --> 48:25.490
You can't stop me.

48:25.615 --> 48:28.451
And I don't wanna talk about it any more.

48:45.135 --> 48:48.180
- Keep that damn light straight.
- Hurry up!

48:48.305 --> 48:53.185
Watch it, you stupid shit!
You're getting blood all over the place!

48:53.352 --> 48:55.313
Who you calling a stupid shit?

48:55.438 --> 48:59.234
I mean, you can't even keep
that fuckin' light straight.

48:59.359 --> 49:01.361
Just hurry up.

49:01.486 --> 49:06.032
Yes, ma'am! We's doin' the bes' we can!
We really are, boss!

49:06.157 --> 49:08.409
Hurry up. I wanna go home.

49:13.499 --> 49:16.043
Just... ..keep your tits, huh?

49:16.210 --> 49:20.089
And I'll let you pull the rope
when the time comes.

49:20.214 --> 49:21.549
I plan to.

49:21.674 --> 49:23.759
I know.

49:42.529 --> 49:46.032
Ernest, tonight's prom night.
Everything all right?

49:46.157 --> 49:50.788
- I didn't know you were interested.
- I'm a student here, amn't I?

49:50.913 --> 49:53.499
- I don't know. Are you?
- Sure I am.

49:53.624 --> 49:55.960
I wanna be on the committee.

49:56.085 --> 50:00.381
You're a little late.
I could've used you a week ago.

50:00.506 --> 50:04.385
I'm not late. I'm right on time.
I wanna collect the ballots

50:04.510 --> 50:07.973
for the king and queen and the voting.

50:08.098 --> 50:12.436
- Think we could arrange that?
- Okay. Can you be here at 6.30?

50:12.603 --> 50:14.980
No. No, I can't be here at 6.30.

50:15.147 --> 50:17.482
I'll be here at 8. How's 8?

50:17.649 --> 50:20.652
- Yeah, that'll do.
- See you then.

50:20.777 --> 50:24.198
- Take it easy.
- I'll take it any way I can get it, pal.

50:24.323 --> 50:25.825
Hey, Helen.

50:25.992 --> 50:27.118
Helen!

50:27.327 --> 50:28.119
Helen!

50:28.286 --> 50:30.788
- What?
- Did you hear about Tommy Ross?

50:31.039 --> 50:33.750
- What?
- Did you hear about Tommy Ross?

50:33.958 --> 50:37.295
- What?
- He's taking Carrie White to the prom.

50:37.462 --> 50:39.297
- No!
- Yeah!

50:41.716 --> 50:45.971
- He can't do that! Where's Sue?
- Yes, he can. He asked her.

50:46.096 --> 50:48.599
- What's she gonna wear?
- Who, Carrie?

50:48.724 --> 50:50.184
A sackcloth?!

50:51.727 --> 50:55.689
- Sweetie, keep those stars coming faster.
- They're coming.

50:55.814 --> 50:59.485
What's this I hear about Tommy
taking Carrie to the prom?

50:59.610 --> 51:02.280
Whatever you've heard, it's true.

51:02.364 --> 51:05.992
Why is he doing it?
Everybody is talking about it.

51:06.117 --> 51:09.162
I asked him to
cos I thought I owed it to Carrie.

51:09.287 --> 51:12.999
- Where's that put everybody else?
- They gotta deal with it in their own way.

51:13.124 --> 51:15.710
- What do you mean?
- Oh... just something.

51:15.836 --> 51:19.382
- Well, you're not going to the prom.
- Oh, I'll be here.

51:19.507 --> 51:22.343
You'll be here?
What, you're going to the prom?

51:22.468 --> 51:25.888
I will tell you later.
You're gonna be in on it.

51:26.013 --> 51:27.974
I'm gonna be in on it? What?

51:28.099 --> 51:30.184
I'm telling you later!

51:30.309 --> 51:33.145
- I want to know now, Chris.
- Just wait.

51:33.312 --> 51:40.404
I won't tell anybody, I promise. I won't say
a word. I'm your best friend. Come on.

51:40.529 --> 51:42.114
Okay.

52:16.150 --> 52:20.487
- You gotta rent a tuxedo for the prom.
- I only got 10 bucks, though.

52:20.613 --> 52:23.449
You can rent a tuxedo!
You don't have to look great!

52:23.574 --> 52:24.575
Hey.

52:24.700 --> 52:26.368
Does this look nice?

52:26.493 --> 52:29.997
He looks beautiful. Make a good
impression for once in your life.

52:30.122 --> 52:32.500
- Would you go out with me?
- Not with ruffles.

52:32.626 --> 52:35.754
You don't have to get ruffles for yourself.

52:35.879 --> 52:38.882
- I don't like ruffles...
- You don't have to get ruffles!

52:39.049 --> 52:40.800
Don't I look sharp?

52:40.967 --> 52:44.304
It looks good on you,
but I don't look right in a tuxedo.

52:44.429 --> 52:48.058
- Have you ever put on a tuxedo?
- I don't have a tuxedo body.

52:50.811 --> 52:54.774
- I know they have tuxedos here for you.
- But I wouldn't look right.

52:54.899 --> 52:56.901
I know just the tuxedo for him.

52:57.068 --> 53:01.405
- Well, what do you think?
- I like it. I think it's terrific.

53:01.531 --> 53:03.658
Look at that. No ruffles at all!

53:14.378 --> 53:17.673
Red. I might've known it would be red.

53:18.841 --> 53:20.843
It's pink, Mama.

53:22.719 --> 53:24.847
Look what Tommy gave me, Mama.

53:25.013 --> 53:27.016
Aren't they beautiful?

53:31.980 --> 53:34.524
I can see your dirty pillows.

53:35.024 --> 53:37.026
Everyone will.

53:37.652 --> 53:39.654
Breasts, Mama.

53:39.821 --> 53:41.865
They're called breasts.

53:41.990 --> 53:43.992
And every woman has them.

53:48.455 --> 53:50.457
Take off that dress.

53:50.583 --> 53:51.709
No.

53:51.834 --> 53:55.713
- We'll burn it and pray for forgiveness.
- No, Mama.

54:08.935 --> 54:10.937
Well, he's not coming.

54:11.062 --> 54:14.608
He is coming, Mama.
Now stop it. I'm nervous enough.

54:20.030 --> 54:22.033
No, he's not coming.

54:23.868 --> 54:25.870
He's not gonna come.

54:31.375 --> 54:33.169
Go away!

54:34.337 --> 54:36.172
Stop it, Mama!

54:36.297 --> 54:39.718
- Stop hurting yourself, Mama!
- I'm not!

54:39.843 --> 54:43.347
He's gonna laugh at you!
They're all gonna laugh at you!

54:43.472 --> 54:46.558
- They're not gonna laugh at me!
- Stay here with me.

54:46.683 --> 54:48.727
I don't wanna stay with you, Mama!

54:48.852 --> 54:51.063
I'll tell him you're sick!

54:51.230 --> 54:53.899
- I'll say you changed your mind!
- Be quiet.

54:53.982 --> 54:55.359
Sit down! Be quiet!

55:07.038 --> 55:09.874
I'll tell him you changed your mind!

55:09.999 --> 55:11.834
Sit down!

55:12.961 --> 55:17.424
Just sit there, Mama,
and don't say a word until I'm gone.

55:20.010 --> 55:22.012
I'll be home early.

55:24.473 --> 55:26.475
I love you, Mama.

55:29.395 --> 55:32.147
Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

55:57.842 --> 55:59.677
Tommy,

56:01.012 --> 56:03.264
could we wait here just a minute?

56:11.815 --> 56:13.817
Are you scared?

56:13.984 --> 56:15.777
Mm-hm.

56:21.074 --> 56:23.118
Maybe this was a mistake.

56:23.285 --> 56:27.122
Oh, no. It's not gonna be that bad.

56:27.289 --> 56:30.210
They're a good crowd. Really.

56:31.544 --> 56:33.213
Really.

56:33.796 --> 56:35.840
Don't be so nervous.

56:36.007 --> 56:40.261
Besides, I'd look awfully stupid
dancing by myself, wouldn't l?

56:40.386 --> 56:41.971
Now come on.

56:51.774 --> 56:54.193
When I look back on my younger days

56:54.318 --> 56:57.112
I really was a maniac,

56:57.279 --> 56:58.656
blowing up the john

56:58.822 --> 57:00.157
with a cherry bomb,

57:00.324 --> 57:02.660
giving the janitor a cardiac.

57:02.826 --> 57:04.328
Well, the teacher could say

57:04.495 --> 57:05.956
they should lock you away

57:06.122 --> 57:08.500
and throw away all the keys
if you please.

57:08.667 --> 57:10.669
He's outta control.

57:10.794 --> 57:13.964
The devil's got a hold of his soul.

57:14.089 --> 57:15.131
Oh!

57:15.298 --> 57:16.633
Man, you wanted the time

57:16.800 --> 57:18.134
so my buddies and I

57:18.260 --> 57:20.470
choked upon a cigarette.

57:20.637 --> 57:22.138
Too tired to jog

57:22.305 --> 57:23.641
and you could barely walk,

57:23.766 --> 57:26.811
swearin' for the hell of it.

57:26.978 --> 57:28.646
Then when it's your right to see

57:28.813 --> 57:29.856
the president's daughter,

57:29.981 --> 57:31.941
the daughter's been so outta sight.

57:32.108 --> 57:32.984
Right.

57:33.109 --> 57:34.443
Dancin' till dawn,

57:34.610 --> 57:37.613
my parents were clear uptown.

57:37.780 --> 57:38.823
Yeah!

57:38.948 --> 57:40.283
High school.

57:40.449 --> 57:41.326
Pre-school.

57:41.451 --> 57:43.412
No, 12 long years

57:43.537 --> 57:44.955
of the education blues.

57:45.122 --> 57:46.290
Teachers.

57:46.415 --> 57:47.666
Preachers.

57:47.833 --> 57:49.167
Don't know how

57:49.334 --> 57:51.837
I ever made it through.

57:52.004 --> 57:53.422
Oh, yeah!

58:06.352 --> 58:08.354
Come on.

58:08.479 --> 58:12.358
Ross, if I knew you'd look this sharp,
I would've taken you instead of, uh...

58:12.483 --> 58:13.443
What's her name?

58:13.568 --> 58:16.613
Don't bother about them.
If they self-destruct,

58:16.738 --> 58:18.741
I'll dance with you.

58:20.659 --> 58:23.954
Hey, where did you buy that dress?
I love it!

58:24.121 --> 58:26.415
- Oh, I made it.
- Made it?!

58:26.665 --> 58:30.628
- The decorations... don't they look great?
- Yeah...

58:30.753 --> 58:35.090
- I'm so nervous.
- It's okay. You can sit with us.

58:35.257 --> 58:38.094
- Hey, what time is it?
- 8 o'clock.

58:38.220 --> 58:39.304
Gotta go.

58:39.429 --> 58:42.098
- Where are you going?
- Just out.

58:42.224 --> 58:43.934
See you later.

58:44.059 --> 58:45.644
Sue!

58:57.031 --> 59:01.369
- Would you like to dance?
- Could we just sit here for a minute?

59:01.494 --> 59:02.662
Sure.

59:02.828 --> 59:04.872
Sure. Anything you want.

59:10.711 --> 59:12.088
Carrie.

59:13.173 --> 59:15.050
Hi, Miss Collins.

59:15.217 --> 59:17.177
You look so pretty!

59:17.344 --> 59:19.221
You, too. You look beautiful.

59:19.346 --> 59:23.475
Thank you! I know I don't, not really,
but thank you, anyway.

59:23.600 --> 59:25.185
May I sit down?

59:25.352 --> 59:28.021
- Yeah. Chair...
- Thank you.

59:29.314 --> 59:32.193
I'm gonna go and talk to some people.

59:52.006 --> 59:55.259
I remember my prom.
I had a date with the, uh

59:55.384 --> 59:57.970
the captain of the basketball team.

59:58.095 --> 01:00:01.891
And he was 6ft 7in tall, so

01:00:02.016 --> 01:00:07.731
I bought a pair of 3-inch spike heels
so that our kiss goodnight would be, um

01:00:07.898 --> 01:00:11.693
Less awkward.
Anyway, we went in his pick-up truck,

01:00:11.818 --> 01:00:16.698
which of course broke down, and we
had to walk the last half-mile to the prom.

01:00:16.865 --> 01:00:20.994
By the time I got there, my feet were
so blistered that all I could do was

01:00:21.119 --> 01:00:27.168
just sit there. I couldn't dance.
So we just sat there and, uh... just talked.

01:00:27.293 --> 01:00:28.878
And, uh

01:00:29.045 --> 01:00:33.007
it was... magic. Is it like that for you?

01:00:33.132 --> 01:00:35.134
It's, um...

01:00:36.594 --> 01:00:38.596
it's nice.

01:00:38.763 --> 01:00:41.682
- Just nice?
- No...! It's...

01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:44.853
It's like, uh...

01:00:46.021 --> 01:00:49.858
- It's like being on Mars.
- You'll never forget it.

01:00:49.983 --> 01:00:52.361
I don't think I will.

01:00:54.321 --> 01:00:55.822
Thank you.

01:00:55.989 --> 01:00:58.242
Hey, what's goin' on here?

01:00:58.367 --> 01:01:01.579
What are you doing with my date?

01:01:01.704 --> 01:01:03.998
- Oh, we're just talking.
- Yeah?

01:01:04.165 --> 01:01:06.876
Have a lovely time, okay?

01:01:07.001 --> 01:01:09.003
And you, too!

01:01:09.629 --> 01:01:11.214
Bye.

01:01:13.758 --> 01:01:17.136
Don't let me catch you
hugging any guys like that.

01:01:17.303 --> 01:01:19.138
I won't.

01:01:19.305 --> 01:01:20.516
Better not.

01:01:20.683 --> 01:01:22.893
I won't.

01:01:30.401 --> 01:01:33.279
Do you really have to be home so early?

01:01:33.404 --> 01:01:35.406
Yeah, I promised.

01:01:36.115 --> 01:01:37.701
Okay.

01:01:38.827 --> 01:01:41.413
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

01:01:42.831 --> 01:01:47.252
Some of the kids are going
over to Nolston's after the prom.

01:01:47.377 --> 01:01:49.045
That's okay.

01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:50.672
What?

01:01:50.797 --> 01:01:54.009
If you wanna go with your friends,
I don't wanna spoil anything.

01:01:54.175 --> 01:01:55.802
Would you let me finish?

01:01:55.928 --> 01:01:59.849
What I was gonna say is that,
if you'd like to,

01:01:59.974 --> 01:02:02.393
we could stop in at The Beehive.

01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:04.812
I've never been there.

01:02:04.937 --> 01:02:05.897
No?

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:08.691
Good! Well, then, let's go!

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:10.234
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:12.528
For sure. Great.

01:02:15.991 --> 01:02:17.993
Are you ready to dance?

01:02:19.369 --> 01:02:21.371
Tommy, l...

01:02:21.496 --> 01:02:22.581
Come on.

01:02:22.706 --> 01:02:25.709
I don't know how. I can't, Tommy. I can't.

01:02:25.876 --> 01:02:28.295
Sure you can.

01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:34.844
I'm not sure

01:02:35.011 --> 01:02:37.931
but the more that it's real

01:02:38.056 --> 01:02:41.851
the more it's right.

01:02:42.018 --> 01:02:45.647
Ooh, one night...

01:02:45.772 --> 01:02:48.942
It's as though we've been lovers

01:02:49.067 --> 01:02:52.571
all of our lives.

01:02:52.696 --> 01:02:56.242
There must be a God.

01:02:56.408 --> 01:03:01.330
Could it be that he's heard me at last?

01:03:01.455 --> 01:03:05.292
Because you look at me

01:03:06.835 --> 01:03:08.420
as the one beautiful...

01:03:08.672 --> 01:03:12.425
Yeah, you can. Come on.
Give me your hand. Just put it there.

01:03:12.551 --> 01:03:15.720
- Like that?
- Yeah. Put this on your shoulder.

01:03:15.845 --> 01:03:17.055
That's right.

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:20.141
Okay, just relax. All right?

01:03:21.393 --> 01:03:24.896
Okay. Just listen to the music.

01:03:25.063 --> 01:03:27.275
That's right.

01:03:27.441 --> 01:03:30.611
See, you got it? That's good.

01:03:30.736 --> 01:03:33.781
You're as good as anyone else out here.

01:03:34.448 --> 01:03:36.033
Got it?

01:03:39.704 --> 01:03:41.873
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

01:03:41.998 --> 01:03:44.125
- It's just...
- That's all right.

01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:45.627
No harm...

01:03:45.794 --> 01:03:47.212
No foul.

01:03:47.379 --> 01:03:49.840
- I can't do anything.
- Yeah, you can.

01:03:49.965 --> 01:03:53.343
I can't dance. I can't even... I don't know.

01:04:16.242 --> 01:04:18.244
- Tommy?
- Yeah?

01:04:18.411 --> 01:04:20.455
Why...

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:24.001
- Why what?
- Why am I here?

01:04:25.502 --> 01:04:27.630
Because it's the prom.

01:04:27.796 --> 01:04:30.049
Why am I here with you?

01:04:32.092 --> 01:04:34.511
Because I asked you.

01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:37.932
Why'd you ask me?

01:04:38.057 --> 01:04:40.060
Because I wanted to.

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:43.813
Why'd you want to?

01:04:44.356 --> 01:04:46.816
Because you liked my poem.

01:04:48.026 --> 01:04:51.613
Only, I didn't write it. Somebody else did.

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:53.365
Oh.

01:04:53.865 --> 01:04:56.368
Carrie, we're here

01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:59.997
and we're together

01:05:00.164 --> 01:05:01.916
and I like it.

01:05:02.542 --> 01:05:04.168
I do, I like it!

01:05:04.335 --> 01:05:07.171
Where there are other girls

01:05:07.296 --> 01:05:11.384
but tonight there's only me.

01:05:11.551 --> 01:05:16.056
I never dreamed someone like you

01:05:16.223 --> 01:05:21.687
could love someone like me.

01:05:45.253 --> 01:05:47.630
All right, ladies and gentlemen!

01:05:47.755 --> 01:05:49.090
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:05:49.257 --> 01:05:52.303
And you two behave yourselves, okay?

01:05:52.928 --> 01:05:57.933
Take your seats, please. We've gotta vote
for the king and the queen.

01:06:05.983 --> 01:06:07.401
Tommy,

01:06:07.526 --> 01:06:09.528
we are here.

01:06:09.653 --> 01:06:11.406
I know.

01:06:12.616 --> 01:06:14.784
Do you wanna decline?

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:16.286
Do you?

01:06:17.579 --> 01:06:22.792
Hell, no. If you win, all they do is put you
up there for a school song and a dance.

01:06:22.918 --> 01:06:25.337
Then they take your picture
for the yearbook,

01:06:25.462 --> 01:06:28.632
so everyone can see
we look like a couple of idiots.

01:06:29.467 --> 01:06:32.136
Anyway, it's the last year. Why not?

01:06:32.261 --> 01:06:33.971
It's so beautiful!

01:06:38.434 --> 01:06:39.769
Hey...

01:06:39.894 --> 01:06:42.897
You're beautiful.

01:06:48.111 --> 01:06:53.075
Well, who should we vote for?
They're more your crowd than mine.

01:06:53.283 --> 01:06:55.285
I don't even have a crowd.

01:06:57.162 --> 01:06:58.705
Let's vote for ourselves.

01:07:00.123 --> 01:07:01.458
No.

01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:03.001
Why not?

01:07:03.126 --> 01:07:06.256
Please don't vote for ourselves.

01:07:08.466 --> 01:07:10.051
Carrie...

01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:22.188
Come on. To the devil with false modesty.

01:07:23.732 --> 01:07:25.401
The devil!

01:08:00.563 --> 01:08:02.565
Billy! Shh!

01:08:02.732 --> 01:08:05.151
Will you close that a little bit?

01:08:05.318 --> 01:08:07.653
Jesus, you wanna get caught?

01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:12.533
- That Carrie White, she sure is cute.
- Shut up.

01:08:12.658 --> 01:08:17.537
- Thought you said they were gonna win.
- They will. Won't even be close.

01:08:17.662 --> 01:08:20.042
I called in a few favours.

01:08:20.167 --> 01:08:22.294
Can I have your ballot, please?

01:08:27.424 --> 01:08:29.426
Hello, guys. Thank you.

01:08:30.469 --> 01:08:33.305
Can I have your ballots, please?

01:08:39.145 --> 01:08:40.979
- Thank you.
- Thanks, there.

01:08:41.147 --> 01:08:42.982
Thank you.

01:08:44.192 --> 01:08:46.152
Thank you, there.

01:08:46.277 --> 01:08:48.279
Ballots, please. Thank you.

01:08:48.404 --> 01:08:49.363
Thank you.

01:08:49.488 --> 01:08:51.241
Freddy, hurry up, please.

01:08:51.407 --> 01:08:53.785
Ballots...

01:08:53.952 --> 01:08:56.872
Good, good. Thanks a lot there, Vic.

01:08:58.957 --> 01:09:00.960
Get all of them?

01:09:03.921 --> 01:09:07.216
They're right in back of you,
so start kicking.

01:09:15.559 --> 01:09:18.478
- See you.
- Good luck.

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:22.357
More ballots? Thank you.

01:09:22.482 --> 01:09:24.943
I have some more ballots for you.

01:09:25.068 --> 01:09:26.819
Thank you.

01:10:14.037 --> 01:10:16.915
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've got the winners.

01:10:17.081 --> 01:10:18.750
All right!

01:10:18.917 --> 01:10:21.878
I give you Tommy Ross and Carrie White!

01:16:45.115 --> 01:16:49.246
They're all gonna laugh at you!

01:16:49.371 --> 01:16:52.040
They're all gonna laugh at you!

01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:54.292
They're all gonna laugh at you!

01:16:54.417 --> 01:16:57.963
- Plug it up! Plug it up!
- They're all gonna laugh at you!

01:16:58.296 --> 01:17:00.799
- Plug it up! Plug it up!
- They're all gonna laugh at you!

01:17:00.924 --> 01:17:02.759
We're all sorry, Cassie.

01:17:02.926 --> 01:17:05.721
- They're all gonna laugh at you!
- We're all sorry, Cassie.

01:17:05.846 --> 01:17:08.349
Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.

01:17:08.641 --> 01:17:11.686
Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.

01:17:12.144 --> 01:17:15.189
Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.

01:17:18.651 --> 01:17:20.987
Come on, let's go, Billy!

01:17:21.112 --> 01:17:23.865
- They're all gonna laugh at you!
- We're sorry, Cassie.

01:17:23.991 --> 01:17:25.742
They're all gonna laugh at you!

01:17:25.867 --> 01:17:26.868
We're sorry, Cassie.

01:17:26.994 --> 01:17:29.162
- Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.
- They're all gonna laugh at you!

01:17:29.288 --> 01:17:31.123
We're sorry, Cassie.

01:17:31.206 --> 01:17:32.082
They're all gonna laugh at you!

01:17:32.207 --> 01:17:33.166
We're sorry, Cassie.

01:17:33.292 --> 01:17:34.126
Trust me, Carrie.

01:17:46.973 --> 01:17:49.183
Somebody open this door!

01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:50.685
Open this door now!

01:17:54.606 --> 01:17:56.608
Help! Help!

01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:36.484
Look at him!

01:19:01.635 --> 01:19:03.470
Have these students calm down!

01:19:05.639 --> 01:19:07.182
Mr Fromm! Mr Fromm!

01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:35.421
Carrie!

01:19:36.839 --> 01:19:38.132
Carrie...!

01:26:09.753 --> 01:26:11.547
Mama?

01:26:15.176 --> 01:26:17.386
Mama?

01:26:17.511 --> 01:26:20.848
Mama? Mama, it was bad, Mama.

01:26:21.015 --> 01:26:23.100
They laughed at me.

01:26:23.225 --> 01:26:25.770
Mama, hold me.

01:26:25.937 --> 01:26:28.898
Mama, please, hold me.

01:26:37.449 --> 01:26:38.408
Hold me, Mama.

01:26:38.533 --> 01:26:40.911
Please, hold me!

01:26:43.622 --> 01:26:46.833
I should have killed myself
when he put it in me.

01:26:48.336 --> 01:26:51.422
After the first time,
before we were married.

01:26:51.589 --> 01:26:54.050
Ralph promised never again.

01:26:55.802 --> 01:26:59.305
He promised, and I believed him.

01:27:01.724 --> 01:27:03.726
But sin never dies.

01:27:05.478 --> 01:27:07.481
Sin never dies.

01:27:09.275 --> 01:27:11.277
At first it was all right.

01:27:11.402 --> 01:27:13.737
We lived sinlessly.

01:27:13.904 --> 01:27:17.408
We slept in the same bed,
but we never did it.

01:27:18.993 --> 01:27:23.163
And then, that night,

01:27:24.749 --> 01:27:28.003
I saw him looking down at me that way.

01:27:32.132 --> 01:27:35.719
We got down on our knees
to pray for strength.

01:27:37.262 --> 01:27:40.348
I smelled the whisky on his breath.

01:27:42.226 --> 01:27:46.939
And he took me... He took me.

01:27:48.482 --> 01:27:53.070
With the stink of the filthy
roadhouse whisky on his breath.

01:27:53.154 --> 01:27:55.364
And I liked it.

01:27:55.489 --> 01:27:57.700
I liked it!

01:27:59.452 --> 01:28:05.000
Well, all that dirty touching in his hands
and coming all over me...

01:28:05.125 --> 01:28:09.087
I should have given you to God
when you were born.

01:28:09.254 --> 01:28:12.716
But I was weak and backsliding.

01:28:16.136 --> 01:28:19.682
But now the devil has come home.

01:28:19.807 --> 01:28:21.351
Oh!

01:28:23.561 --> 01:28:24.771
We'll pray.

01:28:24.937 --> 01:28:26.773
Yes.

01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:28.942
We'll pray.

01:28:30.193 --> 01:28:32.195
We'll pray.

01:28:32.612 --> 01:28:34.614
We'll pray.

01:28:34.739 --> 01:28:36.240
For the last time,

01:28:36.951 --> 01:28:38.577
we'll pray.

01:28:44.541 --> 01:28:47.670
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:50.547
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done...

01:29:42.019 --> 01:29:43.061
Aghh!

01:29:49.109 --> 01:29:49.777
Ohh!

01:29:51.362 --> 01:29:51.946
Aghh!

01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:54.073
Aaghhh...!

01:34:12.429 --> 01:34:14.431
Hello?

01:34:14.681 --> 01:34:17.225
Oh, Betty, thank God it's you.

01:34:17.392 --> 01:34:21.730
I don't think I could have handled
one more reporter.

01:34:21.897 --> 01:34:26.110
Yeah, well, we're all a little edgy.

01:34:27.904 --> 01:34:31.908
She's better. Well, uh,
sleeping too much, I guess,

01:34:32.033 --> 01:34:38.206
but Dr Schnieder said that's to be
expected after all she's been through.

01:34:38.373 --> 01:34:43.879
Well, he said that she's young enough,
so that she'll forget about it in time.

01:34:44.046 --> 01:34:49.969
No. I wouldn't let her go to the funerals,
with Tommy and all the others gone.

01:34:50.135 --> 01:34:53.222
It's best we just go away for a while.

01:36:25.361 --> 01:36:27.196
It's all right!

01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:37.290
It's all right. I know. It's all right.

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.418
It's all right. I'm here.
