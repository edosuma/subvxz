00:35.467 --> 00:36.760
The ancient book say...

00:36.794 --> 00:38.394
That in the beginning...

00:38.627 --> 00:40.494
There was no light in our world.

00:41.367 --> 00:43.237
It took a super strong man...

00:43.262 --> 00:46.339
To bring the sun down
to our little planet.

00:49.515 --> 00:50.948
The guardian of the sun...

00:50.973 --> 00:54.270
Regulates the seasons, looks
after land and stuff like that.

00:55.675 --> 00:56.815
As for the moon...

00:56.975 --> 00:59.015
It was brought over from
the world of dreams...

00:59.040 --> 01:00.700
By the first guardian of the moon.

01:03.042 --> 01:04.025
Actually,

01:04.282 --> 01:06.660
he is someone who brought
dreams into our world as well.

01:09.148 --> 01:10.039
And that's...

01:10.064 --> 01:11.699
How the balance was created...

01:11.724 --> 01:13.624
Between day and night.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.045
Sohone!

01:55.869 --> 01:56.416
Hye, girls.

01:58.401 --> 01:59.538
How you doin'?

02:02.811 --> 02:03.897
Tomorrow is the big day.

02:04.286 --> 02:07.004
Guess who is about to become the
next "guardian of the sun".

02:07.604 --> 02:09.514
Sohone!

02:10.221 --> 02:11.066
Damn right.

02:28.632 --> 02:29.132
Glim!

02:29.413 --> 02:32.583
I know what you're upto and I
forbid you to even think about it.

02:32.967 --> 02:34.702
You are not going to that ridiculous show.

02:34.727 --> 02:35.396
If you say, dad.

02:35.397 --> 02:37.618
It's not your business and
it was too dangerous.

02:38.129 --> 02:39.392
I told you a million times,

02:39.596 --> 02:40.527
but, no no no no no!

02:40.863 --> 02:42.623
Why should you listen
to an old candle, han.

02:42.989 --> 02:43.999
Well, young lady

02:44.024 --> 02:46.253
because this old candle knows better.

02:46.769 --> 02:48.679
You know you can't go out in the sun.

02:49.220 --> 02:52.023
Last time you snucked out your
arms melted down your feet...

02:52.048 --> 02:52.218
Yep!

02:52.243 --> 02:54.955
I'm not good to spend my
life resculpturing you.

02:54.980 --> 02:55.687
Of course!

02:55.771 --> 02:57.211
You want to end up like your mother.

02:57.537 --> 02:59.669
She also wanted to see the world.

03:00.499 --> 03:03.390
Oh, Ursula, my poor precious darling!

03:03.882 --> 03:07.612
Why did you have to go out for big carrots in
a terrible heat flame at 3 in the afternoon.

03:07.781 --> 03:10.086
I told you the fields weren't safe.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.609
Nightfall!

03:12.812 --> 03:13.726
Quick! Get to bed

03:13.751 --> 03:15.311
and find something else to dream about.

03:15.539 --> 03:17.380
If I catch you trying to go tomorrow...

03:17.381 --> 03:18.901
You are gonna be in big trouble...

03:18.926 --> 03:19.635
Young lady.

03:19.804 --> 03:23.435
You making me boil and the
melting's giving me wrinkles

03:23.460 --> 03:24.929
end of a conver...

03:24.954 --> 03:26.146
Sa...

03:26.171 --> 03:26.683
Tion.

04:10.714 --> 04:12.409
My, friends.

04:13.386 --> 04:14.737
As you all know

04:15.315 --> 04:16.950
tomorrow I shall be named...

04:17.028 --> 04:19.428
The new "guardians of the moon".

04:21.134 --> 04:23.080
It will be a historic moment...

04:23.081 --> 04:25.449
For all, people

04:25.450 --> 04:27.132
of the night.

04:39.453 --> 04:39.953
Miss me!

04:46.898 --> 04:48.078
You can catch me, come on.

04:51.685 --> 04:52.565
And I will be will...

05:02.363 --> 05:05.004
Mune can't you be responsible for once.

05:05.324 --> 05:07.105
You've embarrassed me in front of leeyoon.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.812
I forbid you to go to
the ceremony tomorrow.

05:12.351 --> 05:14.820
You can come out when you are
ready to make yourself useful.

05:22.294 --> 05:23.458
But I am useless.

06:12.367 --> 06:13.289
Ya!

06:13.461 --> 06:14.609
Today is the day.

06:15.062 --> 06:17.054
Everyone to the arena.

06:39.175 --> 06:41.464
Oh poor daddy, still frozen!

06:43.544 --> 06:45.384
This day is going to go
down in historic, dad.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.379
I can't miss it.

06:47.309 --> 06:48.749
Don't worry, I'll stay in the shade.

06:49.028 --> 06:49.637
I promise.

06:50.621 --> 06:51.129
Love you.

06:53.426 --> 06:54.347
I'll be back for lunch.

07:19.112 --> 07:19.870
People of the day!

07:21.070 --> 07:22.270
Give you applause...

07:22.327 --> 07:23.267
For the mench...

07:23.760 --> 07:24.600
The mighty...

07:25.253 --> 07:26.593
The legendary...

07:27.043 --> 07:28.650
Guardian of the sun.

07:28.683 --> 07:30.919
Master xolal.

07:33.050 --> 07:37.337
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you...

07:45.326 --> 07:47.526
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

07:48.732 --> 07:50.023
Thank you! Thank you!

07:52.532 --> 07:54.758
Thank you my dear krrrack!

07:54.772 --> 07:57.471
You have the sweetest heart of stone.

07:59.755 --> 08:01.822
People of the day.

08:01.832 --> 08:04.392
I've been in charge of the sun's past...

08:05.792 --> 08:08.982
For 350 years now.

08:09.101 --> 08:11.199
It's time for me to step down.

08:11.331 --> 08:13.961
I call upon my disciple

08:14.184 --> 08:15.644
to come forward

08:20.038 --> 08:20.896
ya!

08:30.761 --> 08:31.261
Ya!

08:35.405 --> 08:35.905
Sohone!

08:35.929 --> 08:36.279
Ya!

08:36.304 --> 08:37.323
Sohone!

08:42.881 --> 08:46.961
As long as the sun shines brightly

08:47.335 --> 08:50.045
the moon will glow humbly.

08:52.582 --> 08:57.621
I am yule, the guardian of the moon.

08:58.152 --> 09:02.455
I call upon my disciple

09:02.702 --> 09:05.429
to step forward

09:11.233 --> 09:12.946
oh, sun!

09:14.087 --> 09:16.555
I present to you, my disciple

09:17.355 --> 09:19.682
he has a heart of fire.

09:19.981 --> 09:22.541
And I believe him worthy of you.

09:29.815 --> 09:31.721
I acknowledge him!

09:46.646 --> 09:48.556
We're all gonna die!

09:49.951 --> 09:50.951
Help me.

09:58.546 --> 10:01.811
The sun recognizes its new guardian

10:01.836 --> 10:03.404
I name

10:05.544 --> 10:06.868
sohone!

10:06.869 --> 10:08.387
Yes, sohone!

10:14.445 --> 10:18.018
Thank you! Thank you! Hello darling!

10:22.165 --> 10:24.838
Sohone!

10:33.559 --> 10:34.286
Kukku!

10:36.065 --> 10:37.474
Oh, moon.

10:38.205 --> 10:42.713
I present to you my disciple...

10:42.925 --> 10:44.758
He has a heart...

10:44.798 --> 10:46.396
Oh goody!

10:46.421 --> 10:47.729
And I believe him...

10:48.421 --> 10:49.181
Of you.

10:49.603 --> 10:52.883
But, only one creature on the planet

10:52.887 --> 10:54.521
can be the judge of this.

10:56.949 --> 10:59.815
The purest creature of all.

11:02.022 --> 11:03.978
The moon...

11:03.979 --> 11:06.145
Recognizes...

11:30.981 --> 11:31.972
What is this?

11:32.278 --> 11:34.477
Mune! Get out of there, right now!

11:35.407 --> 11:36.153
Mune!

11:38.017 --> 11:39.555
Who do you think you are.

11:39.568 --> 11:39.963
I...

11:39.973 --> 11:41.955
You are ruining my ceremony.

11:45.908 --> 11:47.225
Go!

11:47.250 --> 11:48.618
Go!

11:48.643 --> 11:49.885
Get out of here!

11:51.944 --> 11:52.444
Stay!

11:52.806 --> 11:53.704
Stay still!

11:53.775 --> 11:57.022
What's your name, little creature?

11:57.023 --> 11:57.877
Mune!

11:57.895 --> 11:58.998
Well then

11:59.242 --> 12:00.468
mune!

12:00.482 --> 12:04.241
You are the new guardian of the moon.

12:05.802 --> 12:07.273
What! Him?

12:07.713 --> 12:10.722
But, you said this whole
ritual was a formality.

12:10.723 --> 12:11.560
Well,

12:11.561 --> 12:14.935
the moon felt otherwise.

12:30.066 --> 12:33.406
There can be no day without night.

12:33.966 --> 12:37.433
The same goes for the guardians.

12:37.626 --> 12:42.177
The harmony of the planet
now rests in your hands.

12:43.584 --> 12:45.972
Prove yourselves worthy.

12:53.721 --> 12:55.528
You double crossed leeyoon

12:55.529 --> 12:57.154
you little blue rat!

12:57.155 --> 12:58.785
But I never wanted this.

12:58.786 --> 13:02.382
The big one is as arrogant as you were.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.562
The small one is as naive as you were.

13:05.593 --> 13:09.426
It was an honor to serve
as guardian with you.

13:10.173 --> 13:11.818
Come here, old chap!

13:42.057 --> 13:42.979
Necross!

13:43.093 --> 13:44.697
Necross!

13:47.670 --> 13:49.324
Xolal's reign is over.

13:49.325 --> 13:51.513
The old lizard is on his way out out.

13:51.727 --> 13:53.464
Spleen, get your butt over here, quick.

13:53.470 --> 13:55.050
Come on. Chill out, mox.

13:55.114 --> 13:57.675
All this negative energy stressing me out.

13:57.682 --> 13:58.562
What? You wanna fight.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.179
I will mess you up!

14:00.180 --> 14:01.509
Silence!!!

14:05.466 --> 14:11.656
I have been burning with desire to hear
that delightful news for centuries!

14:11.693 --> 14:16.319
Now the time has come
to steal back the sun!

14:18.418 --> 14:20.116
The boss is on fire.

14:20.117 --> 14:23.627
We are gonna so chaos
and misery everywhere!

14:23.824 --> 14:24.957
Yepi.

14:26.901 --> 14:29.168
My precious one's!!!!

14:30.253 --> 14:31.191
What are those?

14:31.194 --> 14:34.000
These are evil corruptors.

14:34.106 --> 14:38.108
They find darkness in
even the purest of souls.

14:39.761 --> 14:41.083
Here! Here! Make me evil!

14:41.107 --> 14:42.353
Make me evil!

14:42.378 --> 14:43.573
Please...

14:43.924 --> 14:44.599
Well.

14:45.186 --> 14:46.210
Whatever!

14:46.236 --> 14:50.122
Soon, that the sun will be mine

14:56.873 --> 14:59.173
years of training.

14:59.393 --> 15:02.336
I was going to be the perfect guardian.

15:02.939 --> 15:04.208
Moon was meant for me,

15:04.514 --> 15:05.668
no one else.

15:08.161 --> 15:11.517
Obviously, the moon was meant for you.

15:11.524 --> 15:13.178
Right, me!

15:13.473 --> 15:16.546
Precisely, no one else.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.209
Certainly not that...

15:18.210 --> 15:20.278
Ridiculous little blue rat.

15:20.900 --> 15:23.454
That thing, a guardian!

15:23.473 --> 15:25.580
Exactly, give me a break!

15:25.581 --> 15:27.118
Clearly the old guardian's...

15:27.119 --> 15:29.775
Made an absurd choice.

15:30.083 --> 15:32.256
Necross agrees with you.

15:32.269 --> 15:33.281
Necross?

15:33.323 --> 15:35.612
Mune stole your place.

15:35.637 --> 15:37.112
Really.

15:37.137 --> 15:40.823
What does necross think
I should do about it?

15:40.837 --> 15:43.137
Take back whats rightfully yours.

15:43.707 --> 15:44.577
Meaning?

15:44.664 --> 15:46.057
The sun for him

15:47.110 --> 15:49.037
the moon for you.

15:49.377 --> 15:50.330
Come on, leeyoon!

15:50.581 --> 15:53.404
You know you deserve the moon.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.034
Ya!

15:56.998 --> 15:58.802
I do.

16:20.499 --> 16:21.783
Well, mune.

16:22.610 --> 16:25.179
This is your home now.

16:30.578 --> 16:34.158
I felt the same way, the first time.

16:34.749 --> 16:35.965
Whats that for?

16:35.997 --> 16:39.499
Well, to steer the temple, of course.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.703
And what's this?

17:10.540 --> 17:13.868
You know where the moon
comes from, don't you.

17:13.965 --> 17:14.873
No.

17:15.097 --> 17:17.635
It comes from the world of dream.

17:18.141 --> 17:21.465
The first guardian carved the moon...

17:21.470 --> 17:25.584
And brought it into our
world through this trap door.

17:25.593 --> 17:29.492
And now it's your turn to watch over it.

17:29.510 --> 17:31.391
But I don't know what I am supposed to do?

17:31.392 --> 17:35.582
The role of guardian of the
moon is extra complexity...

17:35.583 --> 17:38.556
And all this made
this extremely careful.

17:38.576 --> 17:42.876
You should never put dire consequences.

17:42.877 --> 17:45.397
Goodbye!

17:52.808 --> 17:55.256
Look, I really think there's been a mistake

17:55.257 --> 17:57.949
I'm scared of the dark, the
stars, all look the same to me.

17:57.950 --> 17:59.969
I get dawn and dusk mixed up.

17:59.970 --> 18:02.574
I'm a terrible singer, so...

18:02.575 --> 18:03.849
Guardian of the moon!

18:05.584 --> 18:06.682
Master yule?

18:09.345 --> 18:11.195
Master yule, are you okay?

18:47.241 --> 18:48.167
It's...

18:50.909 --> 18:53.282
I got no words, it is just...

18:54.049 --> 18:55.588
It's just...

18:55.622 --> 18:56.431
Am I right?

18:57.153 --> 18:58.408
My bad.

18:58.560 --> 19:01.536
Don't worry, I'm used to it.

19:01.586 --> 19:02.706
And yes, it's just...

19:03.997 --> 19:06.772
Man! This dude was cool.

19:07.245 --> 19:08.528
Can you imagine!

19:08.545 --> 19:12.064
That guy harpooned the sun and
brought it to our planet.

19:12.089 --> 19:13.931
So, let's get down to business.

19:14.150 --> 19:15.328
Where are the harpoons, han?

19:15.329 --> 19:17.022
We hardly ever used them.

19:17.035 --> 19:20.188
Being guardian of the sun
has become more complex...

19:20.201 --> 19:24.144
Since the discovery of astronomy,
astrophysics, quantum physics.

19:24.169 --> 19:26.471
But harpooning is what I trained for.

19:26.521 --> 19:31.092
Well, there are other skills that you
need to learn other than harpooning star.

19:31.104 --> 19:35.825
Season calibration, photosynthesis,
proper solstice management.

19:35.845 --> 19:39.086
You are paying tribute to master xolal.

19:39.449 --> 19:43.995
Like all his predecessors, he has
transformed into a majestic statue.

19:45.759 --> 19:49.785
It is an honor serving you. Master xolal.

19:50.929 --> 19:53.475
And now it's time for fearless guardians...

19:53.500 --> 19:57.292
To embark upon their thrilling
cosmic adventures and...

19:59.595 --> 20:00.424
Hello.

20:00.561 --> 20:02.513
Hey! Come back here!

20:05.832 --> 20:06.551
No.

20:07.354 --> 20:08.099
Glim!

20:08.124 --> 20:09.514
Where are the kill cupboards?

20:11.832 --> 20:13.569
Same place as usual, dad!

20:25.521 --> 20:26.630
I am guardian...

20:26.649 --> 20:28.562
Of the moooon!

20:43.696 --> 20:46.536
I'm pretty sure this thing can go faster.

20:52.029 --> 20:52.529
No!

20:52.580 --> 20:54.809
No! No! No! No! No! No!

20:57.105 --> 20:58.171
Wrong note.

21:02.632 --> 21:04.819
This, this chord?

21:04.844 --> 21:05.479
Maybe...

21:05.900 --> 21:08.830
No! No! No! No! No! No!

21:21.008 --> 21:22.567
Give me that, this chord!

21:22.592 --> 21:23.331
No!

21:23.356 --> 21:24.633
Or this one!

21:49.650 --> 21:51.377
Hello, my fine feathered friend.

21:52.063 --> 21:55.083
Would you like to rest on my broad
and perfectly tend shoulder.

21:57.396 --> 21:58.536
Master sohone!

21:58.546 --> 22:01.289
This much heat could damage the crops.

22:01.521 --> 22:02.945
It's time to raise the sun.

22:02.972 --> 22:05.824
Listen krrrack! Times are changing.

22:05.827 --> 22:08.289
People want the sun that shines you around.

22:08.521 --> 22:09.714
Shines like me.

22:13.607 --> 22:15.319
What the heck is he doing there?

22:21.148 --> 22:21.988
Stop!

22:23.100 --> 22:24.183
Stop!

22:24.826 --> 22:27.501
Stop, you are wrecking everything.

22:31.738 --> 22:33.803
Sorry!

22:40.620 --> 22:42.200
What's mune doing with the night?

22:48.187 --> 22:49.277
Please, stop!

22:58.360 --> 22:59.412
This is a nightmare.

23:12.014 --> 23:12.754
Night time?

23:13.387 --> 23:14.086
At this hour?

23:25.678 --> 23:26.882
The temple's gone off course.

23:28.267 --> 23:29.894
Its latitude is all wrong.

23:32.690 --> 23:35.090
Don't worry, everything is under control.

23:46.776 --> 23:47.801
Where are you going?

23:48.340 --> 23:48.965
Stay here!

24:09.661 --> 24:12.150
Nooooooo!

24:30.183 --> 24:31.584
Oh, man.

24:35.869 --> 24:38.439
That little fuz ball is messing
up my first day on the job.

24:40.077 --> 24:43.204
I have come to pay my
respects to an old friend.

24:43.231 --> 24:45.627
You have my "congratulations".

24:46.449 --> 24:47.471
Oh, leeyoon!

24:47.654 --> 24:49.651
I'm about sorry what happened to you.

24:49.654 --> 24:52.732
But, as you can see I have got a
situation with the night here and...

24:52.757 --> 24:53.933
Yes, I can see that.

24:54.404 --> 24:57.295
Yule made a terrible mistake
choosing that fraud.

24:57.320 --> 25:00.315
Lucky for us, I have got day under control.

25:00.340 --> 25:06.290
Mune's not only hurting the night, sohone.
He is threatening the harmony of our planet.

25:06.315 --> 25:11.851
You will have to deal the
consequences of his failures.

25:11.866 --> 25:13.723
That is so not cool!

25:13.724 --> 25:15.904
You must set things right.

25:16.494 --> 25:19.340
You and me... as guardians.

25:26.328 --> 25:28.421
Master sohone, where are you going?

25:28.446 --> 25:29.898
To get rid of that poser.

25:30.573 --> 25:32.748
I am not gonna let him
jeopardize my career.

25:33.547 --> 25:35.015
But you can't leave the temple

25:35.016 --> 25:36.742
its your duty as a guardian to

25:36.745 --> 25:37.699
to do what?

25:38.154 --> 25:40.314
Have you seen the size of this thing!
Or you worried?

25:40.339 --> 25:42.512
Someone's gonna steal it by guard!

25:54.316 --> 25:54.974
Oh no!

25:56.044 --> 25:57.322
The moon is drifting.

26:15.447 --> 26:16.590
I have an idea.

27:20.054 --> 27:22.943
I don't think I have a
back bone in my body.

27:23.214 --> 27:25.885
Well, I don't have any
bones in my body, really.

27:26.161 --> 27:29.774
But, I just feel like I am a lousy daemon.

27:29.783 --> 27:31.512
I'm bad and...

27:31.518 --> 27:34.596
Hush!

27:35.745 --> 27:37.316
I think I'm doomed.

27:37.341 --> 27:41.065
It's just... I love nature, you know.

27:55.770 --> 27:58.629
Well, nature doesn't love you back.
Get used to it.

27:58.654 --> 28:00.644
Now, let's bust this thing.

28:10.598 --> 28:12.162
What's that fool doing?

28:12.338 --> 28:14.824
Stay here, let me handle this.

28:15.505 --> 28:16.518
Come on, take it.

28:16.527 --> 28:19.068
The moon's fine. Just
put it back in the sky.

28:19.093 --> 28:20.653
And let's forget about the whole thing.

28:21.167 --> 28:23.740
Come on! Maybe no one noticed.

28:23.765 --> 28:25.121
It will be our little secret.

28:30.990 --> 28:33.141
With this wind velocity and
this pressure gradient,

28:33.166 --> 28:35.463
the moon should hit the
lower troposphere and...

28:37.341 --> 28:38.182
What was that?

28:45.698 --> 28:47.844
You come on!!

28:48.118 --> 28:49.962
What are you doing over there?!

28:50.157 --> 28:52.231
I'm carrying this entire thing.

28:53.486 --> 28:57.413
Working pretty hard, back here.
Getting sweaty.

29:05.641 --> 29:06.408
The sun!

29:06.745 --> 29:07.492
No!

29:14.089 --> 29:16.590
And, where do you think!!
You are you going?

29:16.596 --> 29:18.193
Two little devils are stealing the sun.

29:18.216 --> 29:20.499
Its none of your business, let
the guardians handle this.

29:20.524 --> 29:21.611
But I need to tell them

29:21.612 --> 29:23.417
you need do as I say.

29:25.156 --> 29:25.656
Dad!

29:26.330 --> 29:27.245
Give me back my hand.

29:29.384 --> 29:30.008
Dad!

29:31.650 --> 29:34.597
Sweetheart. You're just too fragile.

29:34.631 --> 29:37.529
All I want is to protect you from danger.

29:39.854 --> 29:41.730
You have to trust me, daddy.

29:45.372 --> 29:47.411
Glim, get back here.

29:48.941 --> 29:52.116
You are made of the same
wax as your mother.

29:52.670 --> 29:53.990
Just like all your night friends.

29:54.015 --> 29:56.687
Creeping and crawling and
when you come into the light

29:56.699 --> 29:57.621
its a disaster.

29:57.646 --> 29:58.573
Its not my fault.

29:58.598 --> 29:59.945
Its a responsibility.

30:00.051 --> 30:02.045
Its an honor to be a guardian.

30:02.112 --> 30:03.807
Its an honor I never wanted.

30:03.832 --> 30:04.340
Sohone!

30:04.365 --> 30:05.280
A girl?

30:05.305 --> 30:06.014
Sohone!

30:06.822 --> 30:07.765
Ladies first.

30:07.892 --> 30:09.652
I'll will finish with you later.

30:18.634 --> 30:20.328
A fan.

30:20.353 --> 30:22.971
You came here to see your
hero in action, ay doll?

30:27.261 --> 30:28.275
The sun!

30:28.300 --> 30:29.679
Somebody stole the sun!

30:30.535 --> 30:32.086
What?!

30:33.447 --> 30:35.011
I'll be right back.

30:55.900 --> 30:58.323
No! No! No! No! No! No!
This can't be happening!

30:58.348 --> 31:00.076
It can't be!

31:00.101 --> 31:01.228
The sun!

31:05.124 --> 31:06.861
This is my fault.

31:11.798 --> 31:12.968
Night?

31:12.993 --> 31:14.951
At this time of day?

31:14.976 --> 31:15.976
That's weird!

31:17.292 --> 31:19.214
It probably just an eclipse!

31:20.683 --> 31:21.850
Well! Well!

31:22.960 --> 31:24.858
You are mine once again!

31:25.895 --> 31:28.543
For years I've been watching you.

31:28.568 --> 31:31.488
I spread your light to run the planet.

31:31.513 --> 31:33.536
I spread life.

31:33.561 --> 31:35.801
Still they took you back.

31:35.826 --> 31:38.395
The took your light away from me.

31:38.420 --> 31:41.178
And then plunged me into darkness.

31:42.171 --> 31:43.171
Fine...

31:43.429 --> 31:44.642
Then..

31:49.395 --> 31:52.055
Bring on darkness!

31:52.702 --> 31:53.895
Oh ya!

31:53.920 --> 31:56.274
Have you seen how slap happy the boss is?

31:56.299 --> 32:00.148
Nothing like a little chaos and
destruction to make him smile.

32:03.482 --> 32:06.077
Put the sun somewhere safe!

32:06.102 --> 32:09.004
Where I can watch its heart grow cold.

32:09.029 --> 32:10.228
And die

32:11.216 --> 32:12.217
you are an idiot.

32:12.242 --> 32:13.907
But its not my fault, I...

32:13.932 --> 32:14.352
No!

32:14.377 --> 32:16.377
That wasn't you riding the
temple of the moon like

32:16.402 --> 32:17.500
a wild goroon!

32:17.525 --> 32:18.920
The temple of the moon!

32:18.945 --> 32:21.200
Every guardian has their own style.

32:21.225 --> 32:23.380
Mine, well its a work in progress.

32:24.547 --> 32:25.851
A work in progress?

32:25.876 --> 32:27.212
Oh boy!

32:27.237 --> 32:29.606
You have obviously never
studied the ancient books

32:29.631 --> 32:31.063
or any celestial laws.

32:31.088 --> 32:32.786
And you claim to be a guardian?

32:34.413 --> 32:36.130
Seriously.

32:36.155 --> 32:37.588
You're right.

32:37.613 --> 32:39.641
I'm just a regular kid from the forest.

32:39.666 --> 32:43.003
All I'm good at is calming down
babies who have nightmares.

32:43.028 --> 32:45.012
But yule put me in charge

32:45.037 --> 32:45.979
right?

32:46.004 --> 32:47.910
It must be for a good reason?

32:48.170 --> 32:49.311
So I made one

32:49.336 --> 32:50.593
small mistake, but

32:50.618 --> 32:51.487
you!

32:51.512 --> 32:52.640
I am gonna...

32:52.665 --> 32:53.801
Hey!

32:54.211 --> 32:56.378
Get back here so I can hit you.

32:56.925 --> 32:59.253
I'm a laughing staff because of you.

32:59.278 --> 33:01.657
You're gonna pay for this.

33:01.682 --> 33:03.933
First the moon, now the sun!

33:03.958 --> 33:06.085
I am the one who has to clean up your mess!

33:06.110 --> 33:06.543
But...

33:06.568 --> 33:09.402
You're gonna have the shortest
career of any guardian ever!

33:11.826 --> 33:13.145
Hey! Hands off!

33:15.413 --> 33:17.673
Necross was the thief.

33:17.698 --> 33:19.298
How could only be him.

33:20.494 --> 33:23.113
He must've been plotting his revenge.

33:23.138 --> 33:28.095
Tonight mune gave him the
opportunity to take it.

33:28.120 --> 33:29.984
Okay, let's set a few things straight.

33:30.092 --> 33:31.958
Here! You're the real guardian.

33:32.253 --> 33:34.602
Mune, you are just not up to it.

33:39.791 --> 33:40.872
Hurry, sohone.

33:40.897 --> 33:42.577
Without the sun's light,

33:42.602 --> 33:45.281
the moon will wane and could soon go out.

33:45.306 --> 33:47.265
Don't worry, I'm on it.

33:47.290 --> 33:48.938
I've to get that sun back.

33:51.106 --> 33:53.077
Wait, I'm coming with you.

33:56.292 --> 33:58.102
You are warm.

33:58.127 --> 34:00.420
And if you get too far away I'll freeze.

34:00.501 --> 34:01.974
Listen sweetheart...

34:01.999 --> 34:03.492
You're not gonna leave me here?

34:03.517 --> 34:05.109
Alone...

34:05.134 --> 34:06.622
In the dark...

34:06.647 --> 34:08.083
In the forest.

34:08.108 --> 34:09.782
Unprotected!

34:43.170 --> 34:44.184
Oh no!

34:47.902 --> 34:49.389
What have I done?

34:49.414 --> 34:52.598
You destroyed what was most sacred to us.

34:54.174 --> 34:55.446
My friends!

34:55.818 --> 34:58.502
I'm sorry, I never meant to cause any harm.

34:58.527 --> 34:59.546
But you did.

35:00.392 --> 35:02.397
You are not the moon.

35:03.300 --> 35:05.073
I was trying to get it back.

35:05.098 --> 35:06.382
I almost did, but...

35:06.407 --> 35:09.191
Don't you realize the
consequences of what you've done?

35:10.138 --> 35:12.598
You don't belong here anymore.

35:14.927 --> 35:16.065
No!

35:16.580 --> 35:18.010
No! Don't leave.

35:18.035 --> 35:19.862
I can still fix it, I...

35:25.626 --> 35:26.876
Dad.

35:26.901 --> 35:28.094
I'm sorry.

35:29.070 --> 35:31.365
I promise I'll find a
way to make this right!

35:47.233 --> 35:47.908
Glim!

35:48.846 --> 35:49.963
Gliiimmm!

35:50.705 --> 35:52.638
Where is that girl?

35:53.236 --> 35:54.673
Gliiimmm!

35:56.422 --> 35:57.422
Seriously?

36:02.315 --> 36:05.299
See, harpoons are way more
complex than they look.

36:05.710 --> 36:06.710
If you want good results,

36:06.735 --> 36:09.382
you gotta handle them
with care and attention.

36:10.030 --> 36:11.470
Just like the ladies.

36:11.495 --> 36:13.327
You're right.

36:15.429 --> 36:16.624
Can I get a hand here?

36:16.649 --> 36:17.553
I'm stuck!

36:17.578 --> 36:19.031
Stuck with me?

36:20.932 --> 36:21.893
Lucky girl!

36:22.626 --> 36:24.989
Check me out.

36:25.014 --> 36:28.619
Can't find biceps like
these on night guys, han!

36:28.644 --> 36:29.770
By the way

36:29.797 --> 36:31.817
are you from night or day?

36:31.842 --> 36:32.858
I am mixed!

36:32.883 --> 36:34.337
I am from dawn and dusk.

36:34.362 --> 36:35.722
Do you have any problem with that?

36:35.747 --> 36:37.365
You are not prejudice, are you?

36:37.390 --> 36:39.384
What? No, of course not?

36:39.409 --> 36:40.876
I mean is just that night guys...

36:40.907 --> 36:42.650
They're, different.

36:43.258 --> 36:44.380
They scare kids.

36:44.413 --> 36:45.642
Wait a minute.

36:45.667 --> 36:48.470
The fourth star of the zebra
constellation indicates north.

36:48.495 --> 36:50.048
Which means we're heading east!

36:50.073 --> 36:52.254
We're going round in circles!

36:52.279 --> 36:53.279
Noooo!

36:53.304 --> 36:55.453
No, I know exactly where we're going.

36:57.651 --> 36:59.145
I know my stars, sohone.

36:59.170 --> 37:00.648
I'll take the lead from here.

37:17.545 --> 37:18.406
Really?

37:18.431 --> 37:21.436
No need to swoon over
three blinking insects!

37:24.603 --> 37:26.711
I'm coming to look for the sun with you.

37:26.736 --> 37:28.529
No, can't do, bug boy.

37:28.554 --> 37:30.756
I'm on my way down to the underworld.

37:30.781 --> 37:32.546
Like you could ever handled that.

37:32.571 --> 37:34.357
I wanna fix the damage I did.

37:34.818 --> 37:36.151
That's cute.

37:36.180 --> 37:37.874
And what do you gonna do to necross, han!

37:37.899 --> 37:39.119
Sing him a lullaby!

37:39.166 --> 37:40.933
You won't make it through the forest alone.

37:45.469 --> 37:46.218
You need me.

37:46.272 --> 37:48.891
Finding the sun is serious
business, small fry!

37:48.892 --> 37:50.892
You guys keep arguing that
about who is man enough

37:50.917 --> 37:52.097
I'm going.

37:55.741 --> 37:58.084
Alright, you can guide
me out of the forest.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.780
But after that you're out of the picture.

37:59.805 --> 38:01.885
You are not strong enough
for what's waiting for us.

38:01.910 --> 38:02.640
Hurry!

38:02.665 --> 38:03.799
I'm freezing here!

38:13.719 --> 38:14.673
I am...

38:14.698 --> 38:16.891
Guardian of the moooonnn!

38:17.048 --> 38:20.075
Chu chu chu chu moon moon!

38:20.116 --> 38:21.721
Chu chu chu chu moon moon!

38:21.746 --> 38:23.339
Didn't see you there!

38:24.002 --> 38:25.428
Now...

38:25.453 --> 38:28.693
Rise and go forth into the night!

38:37.615 --> 38:38.498
What?

38:38.523 --> 38:39.333
But, but...

38:39.358 --> 38:40.890
Why won't you stay up?

38:46.489 --> 38:47.489
Sohone!

38:48.021 --> 38:50.251
Aren't you afraid of the lightning monster?

38:50.276 --> 38:51.240
The who?

38:51.265 --> 38:52.386
Well...

38:52.411 --> 38:55.383
You know, the ancient book say that
in order to get to the underworld,

38:56.208 --> 38:58.454
you have to dive into a giant blue hole

38:58.479 --> 39:00.775
and face the terrifying, bloodsucking,

39:00.800 --> 39:03.981
bone crushing lightning monster
guarding the entrance.

39:04.006 --> 39:05.739
No one even knows what it looks like.

39:05.764 --> 39:07.974
Because no one has ever
survived the journey.

39:07.999 --> 39:08.812
Ever!

39:09.635 --> 39:10.951
I don't read books, but

39:10.976 --> 39:12.630
I can throw a harpoon.

39:12.655 --> 39:14.441
You're safe as long as you stay with me.

39:14.466 --> 39:15.890
What about necross?

39:15.915 --> 39:18.435
The ancient books say he became
a gigantic lava monster who...

39:18.460 --> 39:19.880
I told you I don't read it!

39:34.656 --> 39:35.809
Leeyoon?

39:35.834 --> 39:37.796
Whats happening with the moon?

39:37.821 --> 39:39.433
My powers, they're gone!

39:39.458 --> 39:42.471
Never fear, good people of the night

39:42.542 --> 39:44.959
I'm in charge now.

39:56.674 --> 39:58.807
We better hurry!

40:01.626 --> 40:02.782
Don't panic!

40:02.807 --> 40:04.074
Not to worry.

40:15.810 --> 40:17.352
The giant blue hole!

40:17.377 --> 40:20.380
Its exactly how the books described it.

40:20.405 --> 40:21.679
Amazing.

40:21.704 --> 40:22.290
Right!

40:22.315 --> 40:25.788
And how do we get down there?
Disguise ourselves as sardines?

40:29.064 --> 40:31.341
This algae is filled with oxygen.

40:31.366 --> 40:33.206
It will provide enough
air under water for...

40:33.231 --> 40:34.868
Ya, ya, I get it!

40:34.893 --> 40:35.679
OK!

40:36.066 --> 40:38.115
Not too, bitter for you?

40:38.140 --> 40:39.081
Nope.

40:39.106 --> 40:40.120
Delicious.

40:40.145 --> 40:41.059
What?

40:41.084 --> 40:41.979
Strange! I mean

40:42.011 --> 40:44.621
helium algae is known
for being quite bitter.

40:44.646 --> 40:46.709
You've did...

40:46.734 --> 40:48.585
Come here you little...

40:48.626 --> 40:50.882
This over here is oxygen algae.

40:53.344 --> 40:54.528
You see.

40:56.479 --> 40:57.492
Glim.

40:57.517 --> 40:58.523
Here's one for you.

40:58.548 --> 41:00.032
I won't need any.

41:00.057 --> 41:00.891
But...

41:00.916 --> 41:03.298
You should, this stuff
is extra pretty good.

41:03.323 --> 41:05.136
The water is too cold for me.

41:05.161 --> 41:07.388
I might freeze and break.

41:07.413 --> 41:09.413
Why, you thought adventure
was all riding unicorns

41:09.438 --> 41:11.094
and dancing with elves?

41:11.119 --> 41:12.415
Bad news honey!

41:12.440 --> 41:14.704
We are not living in a fairy tale!

41:14.729 --> 41:15.844
Its gonna be okay.

41:15.869 --> 41:18.070
I'll take you with me.

41:18.095 --> 41:19.666
Hot!

41:26.093 --> 41:27.874
Don't let me sink, okay!

41:27.899 --> 41:29.186
You'll be safe.

41:32.858 --> 41:34.736
Just, let yourself go.

41:39.270 --> 41:41.246
I won't let you down.

41:41.271 --> 41:42.699
I promise.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.507
Man, you are really bad with the ladies.

42:03.532 --> 42:04.849
What?

42:04.874 --> 42:05.895
Nothing.

42:27.932 --> 42:28.933
You!

42:29.570 --> 42:30.570
Help me!

42:30.595 --> 42:32.311
The moon is dying.

42:35.159 --> 42:37.265
Hurry! I'm talking to you!

42:37.290 --> 42:38.441
Do something!

42:46.589 --> 42:47.589
No!

42:51.247 --> 42:52.247
No!

43:12.413 --> 43:13.659
No!

43:44.754 --> 43:45.761
Oh no!

43:45.786 --> 43:47.151
Its the big black house!

43:47.176 --> 43:48.753
Its the end of the world!

43:55.816 --> 43:59.308
Darkness is spreading all over the planet.

44:00.358 --> 44:03.019
Chaos! Chaos! Chaos! Chaos!

44:03.292 --> 44:05.870
Stop talking about chaos.

44:05.895 --> 44:07.975
I'm gonna have nightmares again.

44:09.227 --> 44:10.801
Chaos! Chaos! Chaos!

44:10.996 --> 44:12.617
Chaos! Chaos! Chaos!

44:12.870 --> 44:14.577
A chaos hou! A chaos hou!

44:33.053 --> 44:34.452
Glimmmm!

44:34.477 --> 44:36.530
Hey! Unhand the lady!

44:39.269 --> 44:40.254
Glim!

44:40.279 --> 44:41.613
Glim, I'm coming!

44:43.467 --> 44:44.508
I am here!

44:44.533 --> 44:46.016
Let her go!

44:55.448 --> 44:56.467
Glim!

45:08.886 --> 45:09.525
Sohone!

45:09.550 --> 45:11.335
Sohone, do something!

45:11.360 --> 45:12.360
I'm trying!

45:18.942 --> 45:20.067
Up there you go!

45:20.092 --> 45:21.247
You got him!

45:25.629 --> 45:27.169
The lightning monster!

45:27.393 --> 45:29.255
He's gonna rip us apart!

45:29.280 --> 45:30.877
Swim for your life, mune!

45:30.902 --> 45:32.589
Who're you calling monster!

45:32.621 --> 45:33.872
Snort fish.

45:33.897 --> 45:34.604
Hey!

45:34.629 --> 45:36.096
I am the guardian of the sun.

45:36.121 --> 45:37.181
Show some respect.

45:37.206 --> 45:38.273
And I'm...

45:38.298 --> 45:39.811
Phospho!

45:43.006 --> 45:45.121
Are you the guardian of the underworld?

45:45.146 --> 45:47.274
I used to be guardian of the moon, boko!

45:47.299 --> 45:49.699
For that with one I wish you holding spray.

45:49.731 --> 45:52.565
Come on, spiky, get the girl back now.

45:53.187 --> 45:54.637
Atta boy!

45:54.662 --> 45:56.319
A cute little chick.

45:56.344 --> 45:57.770
Ignore to chat here, han.

45:59.168 --> 46:00.897
We need to get to the underworld.

46:00.922 --> 46:02.355
Necross has stolen the sun.

46:02.380 --> 46:03.632
So why didn't you stop him?

46:03.657 --> 46:06.092
I thought you are the guardian?

46:06.117 --> 46:07.543
He sent two little devils.

46:07.568 --> 46:08.849
Wait.

46:08.874 --> 46:11.612
You got aborted by two little minions?

46:13.254 --> 46:14.470
No, but...

46:14.495 --> 46:16.029
Well its his fault.

46:16.054 --> 46:17.335
Quit.

46:17.367 --> 46:18.566
Its giving me a headache.

46:18.591 --> 46:19.658
Master phospho!

46:20.495 --> 46:21.739
I was picked by accident.

46:21.764 --> 46:22.419
But you...

46:22.444 --> 46:24.291
You are a real guardian.

46:24.316 --> 46:25.686
We need your help.

46:26.568 --> 46:28.501
I haven't heard that in a while.

46:28.526 --> 46:29.541
So tell me.

46:29.566 --> 46:31.793
Why try to take the sun back?

46:32.548 --> 46:34.003
To impress the ladies.

46:36.490 --> 46:38.010
Now you are talking?

46:41.191 --> 46:43.071
Impress the ladies!

46:43.096 --> 46:44.176
Brilliant!

47:05.844 --> 47:06.958
Here we are.

47:06.983 --> 47:08.603
On the road to the underworld.

47:09.508 --> 47:12.890
Come on, it got a long
and gloomy decade once.

47:12.915 --> 47:13.915
What about glim?

47:14.617 --> 47:16.228
We can't leave her like this.

47:18.168 --> 47:19.481
Oh right.

47:20.015 --> 47:21.006
The chatty one.

47:22.323 --> 47:23.694
Move aside.

47:23.719 --> 47:26.156
And let the artist work.

47:38.127 --> 47:39.711
Hands off!

47:39.736 --> 47:42.136
Is that any way to thank your savior?

47:42.161 --> 47:44.178
I strengthened your wax, girl!

47:44.203 --> 47:46.842
You should be more flexible for a change.

47:46.867 --> 47:48.328
Or a little kissy will do.

47:48.353 --> 47:50.288
Can I do that too?

47:50.313 --> 47:52.891
Every guardian develops his own gift.

47:52.916 --> 47:53.922
Here's clear

47:53.947 --> 47:56.071
you're screwing everything off.

47:56.096 --> 47:57.540
Who is that guy?

47:57.565 --> 47:59.457
He says he was the guardian of the moon.

47:59.818 --> 48:00.871
Phospho, something!

48:01.167 --> 48:02.185
Phospho!

48:02.210 --> 48:03.370
But the ancient books say...

48:03.395 --> 48:04.660
Come on!

48:04.685 --> 48:06.193
This way!

48:07.590 --> 48:08.738
Mune!

48:08.763 --> 48:10.183
Thank you.

48:10.208 --> 48:11.910
For watching over for me.

48:13.036 --> 48:14.048
Glim.

48:14.073 --> 48:15.987
You can hold on to me
if you feeling scared.

48:16.021 --> 48:17.968
May I hold on to you too

48:18.009 --> 48:20.308
if I'm feeling that we
have been frightened?

48:20.333 --> 48:21.409
No.

48:21.434 --> 48:22.698
Master phospho.

48:22.723 --> 48:24.476
I've read all the history books about him.

48:24.501 --> 48:25.827
But you were actually there.

48:25.852 --> 48:28.168
Could you tell us what really
happened with necross?

48:28.193 --> 48:29.155
Necross

48:30.016 --> 48:33.879
well, a traitor, he is simply
a great guardian of the sun.

48:33.904 --> 48:36.413
But he is not.

48:40.315 --> 48:43.681
He tried to keep the sun all for himself.

48:44.446 --> 48:47.049
Luckily xolal stooped him.

48:47.074 --> 48:47.900
Xolal?

48:47.925 --> 48:49.180
That dried old prune?

48:49.205 --> 48:51.084
Ya my friend, but then...

48:51.109 --> 48:54.241
He was the most powerful
warrior on the planet.

48:54.266 --> 48:58.523
So, there was a clash of titans.
A nasty one.

49:00.172 --> 49:01.705
He smashed necross...

49:01.730 --> 49:05.025
Pulled away down, into the underworld.

49:05.050 --> 49:06.883
And the underworld's...

49:06.908 --> 49:10.750
Whats waiting for you at
the bottom of this casam.

49:12.365 --> 49:14.715
But I don't understand why
xolal had to step in.

49:14.740 --> 49:15.942
As guardian of the moon,

49:15.989 --> 49:18.429
weren't you supposed to watch
over the harmony of the planet?

49:18.454 --> 49:20.053
Yes, and I did.

49:20.078 --> 49:22.037
I watched over the moon.

49:27.681 --> 49:29.558
But then why would you
into exile after that?

49:29.583 --> 49:31.352
Chapter 35 of the book 4 says...

49:31.377 --> 49:33.016
Somebody's gonna research, han?

49:33.384 --> 49:35.251
Well, if you know so much

49:35.276 --> 49:37.394
I guess you won't need my help.

49:37.419 --> 49:38.792
That's not what she meant. We

49:38.817 --> 49:40.443
good luck, kiddos.

49:42.448 --> 49:43.816
Nice job.

49:43.841 --> 49:45.434
What? I was just asking.

49:55.107 --> 49:56.126
The temple!

49:56.151 --> 49:57.998
Whats it doing here?

50:04.096 --> 50:05.190
The moon?

50:05.215 --> 50:06.221
No.

50:06.285 --> 50:07.706
The moon is gone.

50:07.731 --> 50:09.074
The temple has gone insane.

50:09.099 --> 50:10.690
I have to stop it.

50:10.715 --> 50:12.139
We don't have time for that.

50:12.164 --> 50:13.719
The sun is dying.

50:13.744 --> 50:15.237
It might be too late already.

50:15.961 --> 50:17.201
You take care of the sun.

50:17.681 --> 50:18.791
I have to save the moon.

50:19.476 --> 50:22.045
No, mune, remember, the
guardians are linked.

50:22.070 --> 50:23.304
The ancient book said...

50:23.329 --> 50:25.415
You really gotta stop
reading those books, babe?

50:25.440 --> 50:26.489
Come on.

50:30.371 --> 50:32.197
Get lost, marble head!

50:42.351 --> 50:43.351
Goroun!

50:43.376 --> 50:45.055
What are you doing here?

50:46.788 --> 50:47.841
Come here boy!

50:53.243 --> 50:54.139
Quick!

50:54.164 --> 50:55.606
We have to catch him.

50:55.673 --> 50:57.617
Okay, now lets stop that temple!

50:57.642 --> 50:59.375
We have a planet to save.

50:59.400 --> 51:00.229
Go!

51:32.946 --> 51:34.566
Careful!

51:35.229 --> 51:36.148
Don't worry.

51:37.354 --> 51:39.080
This I know how to do.

51:52.573 --> 51:53.573
Hang on!

51:59.575 --> 52:03.399
Mune, don't leave me! Mune!!!!

52:03.424 --> 52:05.967
Oh no, no, no, noooooo.

52:05.992 --> 52:08.588
I don't know how to steer this thing!

52:15.879 --> 52:16.619
Calm down!

52:16.726 --> 52:17.353
Calm down!

52:28.782 --> 52:30.195
Easy boy!

52:30.220 --> 52:31.433
Calm down!

52:31.458 --> 52:32.487
I'm here.

52:47.533 --> 52:48.757
Its working!

52:51.038 --> 52:51.835
Calm...

52:51.905 --> 52:53.870
Down!

53:02.894 --> 53:04.840
That was amazing!

53:10.791 --> 53:11.791
Mune!

53:13.124 --> 53:14.217
Mune!

53:18.661 --> 53:19.794
Did you see that?

53:19.819 --> 53:21.529
My dust worked on him!

53:26.143 --> 53:27.344
Well, look at that.

53:28.050 --> 53:30.517
The legend I got the temple to settle.

53:31.717 --> 53:32.717
He's got guts!

53:34.210 --> 53:37.010
Maybe more than I ever had it.

53:47.065 --> 53:49.098
Who is this?

53:49.361 --> 53:52.799
It looks like the guardian of the sun!

53:53.111 --> 53:54.780
I am the guardian of the sun!

53:55.032 --> 53:57.598
Is that the moron who lost the sun?

53:57.623 --> 53:58.258
Hey!

53:58.352 --> 54:00.462
What a loser!

54:00.702 --> 54:03.035
Mune is the real hero.

54:03.859 --> 54:06.182
You just cleanup.

54:06.316 --> 54:08.848
You are just a loser.

54:09.063 --> 54:10.735
Useless!

54:10.974 --> 54:12.516
Whats he doing now?

54:13.855 --> 54:16.162
He wants to get by?

54:16.307 --> 54:17.780
Moron!

54:18.101 --> 54:20.173
What a pathetic hope!

54:20.450 --> 54:24.383
You're the worst guardian of the sun ever.

54:28.312 --> 54:30.375
Pathetic!

54:30.622 --> 54:34.348
Is that really one you gosh, sheron!

54:38.971 --> 54:39.971
Mother!

54:48.514 --> 54:49.014
Leeyoon!

54:49.389 --> 54:50.577
Leeyoon, where're you?

54:50.912 --> 54:51.892
Leeyoon.

54:51.917 --> 54:53.113
What are you doing?

54:53.138 --> 54:54.565
Leeyoon!

54:54.590 --> 54:55.520
Come on!

54:55.741 --> 54:56.741
Wake up!

54:56.766 --> 54:57.885
Where is the moon?

54:57.932 --> 54:59.185
It died!

54:59.210 --> 55:02.428
I became a guardian and it died!

55:02.453 --> 55:04.041
Everything went wrong.

55:04.122 --> 55:05.400
Why me?

55:05.481 --> 55:07.239
Why me?

55:07.896 --> 55:09.411
So this is the end!

55:09.647 --> 55:10.714
Its not fair.

55:11.060 --> 55:12.806
How could necross betray me?

55:13.744 --> 55:15.545
I did everything he asked.

55:15.570 --> 55:17.383
Those lying snakes!

55:17.408 --> 55:20.295
Those lying liars!

55:20.320 --> 55:21.818
Always picking on me.

55:21.843 --> 55:24.444
I'm in pretty quite love
of already get to know me.

55:24.469 --> 55:25.929
Go then yourselves...

55:26.223 --> 55:28.416
I will get a new moon
from the world of dreams.

55:28.783 --> 55:30.369
Who do you think you are?

55:31.053 --> 55:32.264
A God?

55:32.289 --> 55:34.636
You can't just create a moon.

55:35.117 --> 55:36.403
The first guardian did.

55:38.141 --> 55:40.580
We're all doomed!

55:40.605 --> 55:42.122
Doomed, I tell you!

55:52.525 --> 55:53.357
Come on glim.

55:53.858 --> 55:54.858
Let's go!

55:56.426 --> 55:58.371
Hey, wait for me.

56:04.050 --> 56:04.870
Hello!

56:14.638 --> 56:16.068
What's that?

56:22.444 --> 56:23.644
Are we in the world of dreams?

56:23.669 --> 56:25.481
Nightmares... nightmare everywhere.

56:33.573 --> 56:34.573
Stop!

56:39.267 --> 56:40.147
You did it again!

56:40.751 --> 56:41.284
Ya.

56:42.738 --> 56:43.711
I have got powers!

56:48.854 --> 56:50.740
Maybe the moon was right after all.

56:52.525 --> 56:53.112
Okay!

56:53.601 --> 56:55.424
Now I'm gonna show these ugly monsters

56:55.449 --> 56:57.091
who the real master of dreams is.

56:57.860 --> 57:00.390
Enough with the nightmares.

57:00.415 --> 57:02.922
Lets have some dream!

57:38.378 --> 57:39.778
The moon core!

57:40.586 --> 57:41.985
I thought that was a legend!

57:43.458 --> 57:45.520
By the mighty power of the guardians,

57:45.720 --> 57:48.896
I command a new moon to appear.

58:28.982 --> 58:29.836
Mune!

58:29.861 --> 58:31.007
I saw him!

58:31.032 --> 58:33.814
He carved a new moon!

58:34.094 --> 58:34.994
Who cares!

58:35.101 --> 58:36.054
The sun is dying.

58:36.268 --> 58:38.451
And the moon is as good as dead

58:42.609 --> 58:44.783
this is ridiculous!

58:44.870 --> 58:47.249
This is embarrassing!

58:48.433 --> 58:51.170
They call him the guardian of the sun?

58:51.284 --> 58:53.091
Give me a break.

58:53.116 --> 58:54.704
Stop it!

58:54.831 --> 58:56.031
I'll fight you.

58:57.458 --> 58:58.358
Yes!

58:58.438 --> 58:59.741
Such anger!

58:59.841 --> 59:01.067
So hatred!

59:01.328 --> 59:03.006
Whats happening to me?

59:03.031 --> 59:04.742
You are darker than necross!

59:05.184 --> 59:06.184
Daemon!

59:07.677 --> 59:09.856
You forked tongues mindless worms.

59:14.734 --> 59:17.510
I know you're nearby, necross

59:17.535 --> 59:19.510
you've spread your chaos once.

59:19.535 --> 59:22.579
I won't get away with it again.

59:22.849 --> 59:23.682
Phospho!

59:24.348 --> 59:27.733
That useless fraud is your backup!

59:27.758 --> 59:30.865
I'm surprised to see you
here, my old friend.

59:31.441 --> 59:35.968
I thought you beclouding somewhere...
Behind the rock!

59:37.711 --> 59:40.146
Don't listen to these snakes, boko!

59:40.367 --> 59:43.744
They're trained to make evil
just like they did with necross.

59:44.619 --> 59:46.217
Shut up, mop.

59:46.242 --> 59:48.921
I've enough of your old drooling face.

59:50.516 --> 59:52.954
I'll crush you into dust.

01:00:00.747 --> 01:00:03.307
Respect the mop, kiddo!

01:00:04.486 --> 01:00:05.953
Back on your feet!

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.320
Its too late!

01:00:19.786 --> 01:00:20.949
How're you doing that?

01:00:22.437 --> 01:00:23.270
I don't know.

01:00:23.992 --> 01:00:25.343
I just am.

01:00:52.293 --> 01:00:54.060
I like dreaming with you.

01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:18.412
I...

01:01:18.947 --> 01:01:20.419
I had a funny dream!

01:01:21.048 --> 01:01:22.167
Ya!

01:01:23.401 --> 01:01:24.699
Me too.

01:01:52.648 --> 01:01:53.181
Mune!

01:01:53.206 --> 01:01:54.788
I misjudged you.

01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:56.503
Forgive me.

01:01:56.957 --> 01:01:59.557
You really are the guardian of the moon.

01:02:04.459 --> 01:02:05.119
Well...

01:02:05.144 --> 01:02:06.979
I better put this back in the sky then.

01:02:07.631 --> 01:02:09.603
The moon can't shine
without the sun's light.

01:02:09.628 --> 01:02:11.505
They're connected.

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:12.965
Like the guardians, remember?

01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:14.247
No time to lose then.

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:15.525
Lets find sohone.

01:02:53.045 --> 01:02:54.512
Calm down, kiddo.

01:02:56.364 --> 01:02:58.121
Deep breath!

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:01.345
Here,

01:03:01.593 --> 01:03:03.413
take my energy!

01:03:08.998 --> 01:03:10.412
You look

01:03:10.437 --> 01:03:12.727
much better when you shine.

01:03:16.568 --> 01:03:17.168
Phospho!

01:03:18.225 --> 01:03:19.669
Phospho, what're you doing?

01:03:19.694 --> 01:03:22.093
I'm going out in style.

01:03:22.803 --> 01:03:25.059
For the ladies, right!

01:03:25.439 --> 01:03:27.246
No! Nooo!

01:03:42.284 --> 01:03:44.023
Thank you phospho!

01:03:48.171 --> 01:03:51.157
Now that was a great explosion!

01:03:53.664 --> 01:03:55.952
You're going to have to
try a little harder.

01:03:55.977 --> 01:03:56.611
Spleen!

01:03:56.636 --> 01:04:00.139
You bunch of evil sloshing imbecile!

01:04:01.062 --> 01:04:04.082
I'll have to take care of this myself!

01:04:09.141 --> 01:04:10.164
Sohone!

01:04:12.017 --> 01:04:13.071
Sohone!

01:04:13.096 --> 01:04:14.262
Glim!

01:04:14.287 --> 01:04:15.289
Mune!

01:04:15.314 --> 01:04:17.658
I think I was never gonna see you again.

01:04:22.152 --> 01:04:23.942
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

01:04:26.723 --> 01:04:28.564
We missed you too, my friend.

01:04:30.323 --> 01:04:31.167
Well!

01:04:31.192 --> 01:04:32.221
Shall we.

01:04:59.787 --> 01:05:02.102
Welcome guardians.

01:05:02.127 --> 01:05:03.173
Necross!

01:05:03.198 --> 01:05:06.667
The sun and the moon in the underworld?!

01:05:06.692 --> 01:05:08.092
What a treat!

01:05:08.117 --> 01:05:09.240
Hang on.

01:05:11.492 --> 01:05:12.992
Sohone, watch out!

01:05:13.017 --> 01:05:14.137
Get the sun.

01:05:14.162 --> 01:05:15.931
I'll take care of lava pan.

01:05:17.662 --> 01:05:20.372
You shall know come for
them for such a failure.

01:05:20.397 --> 01:05:22.921
You brought disgrace in the
guardians of the sun's honor.

01:05:22.946 --> 01:05:24.939
I'm gonna enjoy crushing you.

01:05:25.628 --> 01:05:27.095
Quick, we gotta go.

01:05:41.274 --> 01:05:43.148
You're mine, sucker

01:05:43.259 --> 01:05:47.729
and right now your girlfriend is in
the clutches of my evil accomplice.

01:05:47.754 --> 01:05:49.367
Yellow flowers are nice,

01:05:49.392 --> 01:05:50.996
but they're more fragile, right?

01:05:51.021 --> 01:05:52.589
Right... and...

01:05:52.614 --> 01:05:53.809
That's why I gotta go.

01:05:53.834 --> 01:05:55.080
Gotta water them.

01:05:55.105 --> 01:05:56.419
Of course.

01:05:56.444 --> 01:05:57.444
Bye then!

01:06:00.087 --> 01:06:03.684
You thought you can spread
darkness on my planet?

01:06:03.709 --> 01:06:05.376
Then get away with it.

01:06:06.508 --> 01:06:08.732
Not on my watch.

01:06:13.918 --> 01:06:15.385
You're too late.

01:06:15.699 --> 01:06:17.240
The sun is dead.

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:23.496
There's nothing you can do
to save you planet now.

01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:27.351
Oh yaa?

01:06:28.162 --> 01:06:30.162
Take this!

01:06:32.365 --> 01:06:35.411
You bite like a mosquito.

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:42.999
That hurts!

01:06:53.081 --> 01:06:53.773
Glim!

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.467
Don't go any closer.

01:06:57.882 --> 01:06:58.736
Got ya now.

01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:00.536
Its chaos time!

01:07:46.561 --> 01:07:47.334
Glim!

01:07:47.947 --> 01:07:50.370
She is gonna make a nice candle.

01:07:50.457 --> 01:07:53.169
Get your stinking breath out of my face.

01:07:58.421 --> 01:07:59.081
Glim!

01:08:32.723 --> 01:08:33.790
I saved the sun!

01:08:35.268 --> 01:08:35.768
Ya.

01:08:36.261 --> 01:08:37.261
You did.

01:08:37.568 --> 01:08:39.698
You have to help sohone.

01:08:40.259 --> 01:08:41.220
No!

01:08:41.246 --> 01:08:43.179
No, I need to save you.

01:08:43.203 --> 01:08:44.106
No.

01:08:44.131 --> 01:08:45.370
It's too late for me.

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.537
But, you can defeat necross!

01:08:50.278 --> 01:08:52.653
I have seen your power.

01:08:52.678 --> 01:08:55.133
Go!

01:08:55.158 --> 01:08:56.828
My sandman.

01:09:12.631 --> 01:09:16.831
You think you can light the
sun just by puffing it.

01:09:16.856 --> 01:09:20.884
I'll blow it down quicker than
it took your girlfriend to melt

01:09:21.102 --> 01:09:24.576
you're trapped, little blue rat.

01:09:31.027 --> 01:09:31.736
Sohone!

01:09:32.649 --> 01:09:33.598
Quick, mune

01:09:33.622 --> 01:09:34.488
get out of here!

01:09:35.259 --> 01:09:36.636
I can't hold it for long.

01:09:36.662 --> 01:09:39.246
I have enough of you. Die

01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:40.161
insects.

01:09:59.748 --> 01:10:01.135
What's going on?

01:10:02.737 --> 01:10:04.270
I can feel it too.

01:10:05.903 --> 01:10:07.542
Let's show him what we're made of.

01:10:07.608 --> 01:10:10.895
Yah, lets finish him off.

01:10:18.565 --> 01:10:19.565
I got him.

01:10:20.806 --> 01:10:22.466
Nighty night!

01:10:24.033 --> 01:10:24.752
What?

01:10:25.172 --> 01:10:26.758
What've you done to me?

01:10:27.358 --> 01:10:29.211
You're taking a nap, big guy.

01:10:29.238 --> 01:10:30.238
I put you to sleep.

01:10:30.684 --> 01:10:32.317
You dirty little blue rat!

01:10:34.418 --> 01:10:35.951
I am the master of dreams.

01:10:36.317 --> 01:10:37.997
There's nothing you can you do to me here.

01:10:38.022 --> 01:10:39.261
You're gonna pay.

01:10:40.011 --> 01:10:41.730
You really need a cook.

01:10:55.594 --> 01:10:57.728
Hold still, dummy.

01:11:20.833 --> 01:11:23.153
This snake has been squeezing
your heart for too long.

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:09.624
Mune!

01:12:11.753 --> 01:12:12.339
Mune!

01:12:15.943 --> 01:12:17.976
You pulled out the fires of the underworld.

01:12:23.984 --> 01:12:25.737
That was epic!

01:12:36.838 --> 01:12:38.571
I never thought I'd say this, but...

01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:39.522
Bro!

01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:43.709
You really are the most
powerful guardian of all time.

01:12:54.159 --> 01:12:55.159
You okay, mox?

01:12:55.433 --> 01:12:57.079
I bloomed.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.991
We're gonna be fine here.

01:14:57.635 --> 01:14:58.902
That's mune!

01:14:58.927 --> 01:15:00.206
The guardian of the moon.

01:15:01.656 --> 01:15:03.616
Ya, I always knew he would make it.

01:15:05.229 --> 01:15:06.056
What?

01:15:53.361 --> 01:15:54.361
Glim!

01:15:55.133 --> 01:15:56.033
Glim!

01:16:02.012 --> 01:16:04.304
This is gonna be good!

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:20.368
Glim!

01:17:21.538 --> 01:17:23.437
Sohone!

01:17:23.462 --> 01:17:24.462
Glim!

01:17:32.406 --> 01:17:34.617
Glim! Glim! I'm over here!

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.538
Daddy loves you!

01:17:36.539 --> 01:17:39.515
Sweetheart! Glim look around.
I'm on the left.

01:18:21.654 --> 01:18:23.326
My baby kid...

01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.768
I love happy endings!

01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:03.157
My bad!

01:19:04.305 --> 01:19:10.512
