WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:05.481
God, you're beautiful.

00:06.090 --> 00:08.484
Why are we fighting this?

00:08.718 --> 00:12.822
You know you want it to happen
as much as I do.

00:12.888 --> 00:17.076
I want you. I need you.

00:19.437 --> 00:22.081
Let me make love to you.

00:22.148 --> 00:25.084
I don't wanna stand in the way
of, uh, true love or anything...

00:25.151 --> 00:28.587
but I think a cantaloupe
might hurt less.

00:28.654 --> 00:31.173
No, I'm, uh, rehearsing my lines.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.135
They're giving me a romantic story
on Days of our Lives.

00:34.243 --> 00:38.055
It's the first time my character's got one.
I'm nervous. I want it to be good.

00:38.122 --> 00:42.726
Wow, I haven't seen you this worked-up
since you did that dog-food commercial...

00:42.793 --> 00:47.106
and you thought you were gonna be
with a real talking dog.

00:47.173 --> 00:49.859
Yeah, that was a disappointment.

00:49.925 --> 00:53.946
Ooh, hey, you wanna, uh, come down
to the set and tell me if I'm doing okay?

00:54.055 --> 00:55.739
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

00:55.848 --> 00:58.742
You just have to promise not
to get thrown out again.

00:58.809 --> 01:01.662
- That was an honest mistake.
- Right.

01:01.729 --> 01:06.250
"Oh, my God. Is this the men's room?
I feel so foolish.

01:06.317 --> 01:10.254
Have you always known
you wanted to be an actor?"

01:11.197 --> 01:14.466
Yeah, that was an awesome day.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074

01:52.488 --> 01:55.424
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:55.491 --> 01:59.053
You guys wanna come eat dinner
at the restaurant in the next few weeks?

01:59.161 --> 02:00.512
- Sure!
- I'd love to.

02:00.663 --> 02:01.972
Well, you can't.

02:03.207 --> 02:06.852
- We're booked solid for the next month.
- Well, I can't give you a massage...

02:06.919 --> 02:10.481
because my license
has been revoked again.

02:10.548 --> 02:14.235
- Phoebe, what happened?
- Well, it was an accident, you know.

02:14.301 --> 02:17.821
It's a lot of oil and sometimes
the hand just slips.

02:19.515 --> 02:22.409
Have I got a surprise for you.
Pack your bags.

02:22.476 --> 02:26.997
Oh, no. You guys aren't supposed
to get divorced for seven years.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.835
What? No, I'm taking Monica
to a romantic inn in Vermont.

02:31.902 --> 02:37.591
Oh, good. Okay, good for you.
Trying to recapture the magic.

02:38.868 --> 02:41.303
- So can you get out of work?
- Honey, I can't.

02:41.370 --> 02:45.224
- Things are crazy at the restaurant.
- You're really that busy?

02:45.332 --> 02:48.102
Yeah. I'm sorry, I really am.

02:48.169 --> 02:51.605
That's okay.
I'll just, uh, try and reschedule.

02:52.965 --> 02:56.193
Hi, this is Chandler Bing.
I made a reservation there...

02:56.260 --> 02:58.153
and I need to change it.

02:58.846 --> 03:03.033
What do you mean it's nonrefundable?
Well, can I just come some other time?

03:04.018 --> 03:05.703
Can't you make an exception?

03:05.811 --> 03:08.706
Tell them I'm a chef
at a big New York restaurant.

03:08.814 --> 03:13.335
Tell them that in two weeks, I will once
again be a masseuse in good standing.

03:14.612 --> 03:18.382
Look, this is ridiculous.
I'm not paying for that room, okay?

03:18.449 --> 03:21.427
Well, thank you very much.

03:21.744 --> 03:24.596
Yeah, I'm going to Vermont.

03:24.663 --> 03:28.684
- Don't worry, use your travel insurance.
- I don't have travel insurance.

03:28.792 --> 03:33.314
Well, this is what happens
when people live on the edge.

03:33.422 --> 03:34.690
Why don't you take Ross?

03:34.840 --> 03:40.112
Heh. Don't you think that'll be a little
weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn?

03:40.304 --> 03:44.199
- No, not if the room has two beds.
- I guess.

03:44.266 --> 03:48.287
It still seems a little...
"Moonlight boat ride"?

03:52.983 --> 03:56.045
Joey, is this the bed
where Olivia lost her virginity?

03:56.153 --> 03:58.964
I don't know,
but one of the extras sure did.

03:59.031 --> 04:02.593
Listen, Rach. Thanks again
for coming down to watch my scenes.

04:02.701 --> 04:06.305
Please, honey. Just the fact that you
want me here to support you, I'm...

04:06.372 --> 04:11.310
Oh, my God. Is that Christian Saunders?
He is so gorgeous!

04:11.418 --> 04:14.188
And also, so gay.

04:14.255 --> 04:18.274
Well, in my head,
he's done some pretty not-gay stuff.

04:18.384 --> 04:22.863
Well, at the Christmas party, him and
Santa did some definitely-gay stuff.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.990
Joey? Joey, we're ready for you.

04:25.057 --> 04:27.451
- Oh. Ahem.
- Okay. All right, wish me luck.

04:27.518 --> 04:31.330
Okay. Not that you need it, but good...
God! Is that Chase Lassiter?

04:31.563 --> 04:34.750
- He's straight, right?
- Rash, if you weren't here wondering...

04:34.817 --> 04:38.462
if these guys were gay,
I don't know if I could do this.

04:38.570 --> 04:42.925
- I'm sorry, you're right. I'm sorry. Good luck.
- On a bell, please.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.594
Quietly.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.471
And action!

04:48.747 --> 04:50.599
Drake, what are you doing here?

04:50.666 --> 04:52.810
Stopping you from marrying
the wrong man...

04:52.876 --> 04:55.062
and making the biggest
mistake of your life.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.398
- Get out.
- You don't love him.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.149
What do you know about love?

04:59.258 --> 05:02.111
I know what I felt that night
when we kissed under the bridge.

05:02.219 --> 05:05.656
- That kiss never happened.
- Well, what about this one?

05:07.975 --> 05:10.869
Now, I told you to get out.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.996
Fine, I'll go.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.749
But let me ask you one question.

05:15.816 --> 05:20.170
- You look real familiar. Have we...?
- Shh! He's asking her a question.

05:20.988 --> 05:25.092
Can you live the rest of your life never
knowing what we could have been?

05:25.200 --> 05:28.262
- I don't have a choice.
- Yes, you do.

05:28.329 --> 05:33.016
Yes, you do. I'm the one who doesn't
have a choice because I...

05:33.083 --> 05:36.270
Because I can't stop loving you.

05:36.337 --> 05:40.315
- Don't say that.
- Tell me to stop.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.693
Just

05:43.135 --> 05:46.363
tell me to stop.

05:46.472 --> 05:49.324
- Cut!
- No!

05:50.351 --> 05:53.954
Or, cut. You know, that's your call.

05:55.731 --> 05:57.833
- Everything was delicious.
- Thank you.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.544
It was. The duck in particular
was superb.

06:00.611 --> 06:03.046
Thank you.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.093
You haven't said anything.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.804
Actually, I do have one small complaint.

06:10.871 --> 06:15.601
Oh, well, please, I welcome criticism.

06:16.168 --> 06:19.563
The musician right outside the restaurant
is kind of a mood killer.

06:19.671 --> 06:20.856
What musician?

06:21.006 --> 06:24.026
<i>And there's</i> a <i>country called Argentina</i>

06:24.093 --> 06:26.820
<i>It's a place I've never seen</i>

06:26.887 --> 06:33.285
<i>But I'm told for 50 pesos
You can buy a human spleen</i>

06:33.352 --> 06:37.331
<i>Human spleen</i>

06:37.398 --> 06:38.707
<i>Ol√©!</i>

06:40.734 --> 06:42.252
What are you doing here?

06:42.361 --> 06:46.465
You said you had customers lined up
in the street, so I'm here to entertain.

06:46.532 --> 06:49.426
- Great.
- Yeah, it really has been great too.

06:49.535 --> 06:51.553
They must have seen me
play before...

06:51.620 --> 06:54.181
because they requested
a bunch of my songs.

06:54.248 --> 06:56.725
Yeah, "You Suck"...

06:56.792 --> 06:58.810
and, um, "Shut Up and Go Home."

07:00.546 --> 07:02.105
- Listen, Phoebe.
- Yeah.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.150
You know how much
I love listening to your music...

07:05.217 --> 07:08.195
- but...
- But what?

07:08.262 --> 07:13.283
Um, this is kind of a classy place.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.993
Okay, say no more.

07:15.102 --> 07:19.164
<i>It wasn't just that she was fat
The woman smelled like garbage</i>

07:19.231 --> 07:20.374
Everyone!

07:20.441 --> 07:25.504
<i>It wasn't just that she was fat
The woman smelled like garbage</i>

07:25.863 --> 07:27.631
Classy, huh?

07:33.120 --> 07:35.180
Hi, Chandler Bing. I have a reservation.

07:35.247 --> 07:38.225
Welcome to the Chestnut Inn.
Where are you joining us from?

07:38.333 --> 07:41.436
- New York.
- The Big Apple.

07:41.503 --> 07:45.649
He's wound up. We had to stop at every
maple-candy stand on the way here.

07:45.716 --> 07:49.069
I ate all my gifts for everybody.

07:50.471 --> 07:53.824
I'm sorry, there's no record
of your reservation in the computer.

07:53.932 --> 07:58.829
- That's impossible. Check again, please.
- Check again, please.

07:59.688 --> 08:03.417
- I'm sorry, it's not here.
- It's not there.

08:03.484 --> 08:07.129
Let me get this straight.
I called to try to cancel my reservation...

08:07.196 --> 08:11.133
was told it's not refundable.
We drove six hours all the way up here...

08:11.200 --> 08:14.469
- and now we don't have a reservation?
- I don't know what to say.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.888
She doesn't know what to say.

08:16.955 --> 08:19.182
Just give us
the cheapest room you have.

08:19.291 --> 08:23.395
The only thing we have available
is our deluxe suite. The rate is $600.

08:23.504 --> 08:26.023
- That's insane.
- It's totally insane.

08:26.089 --> 08:30.235
Let's drive home. We'll hit all the
maple-candy stores on the way back...

08:30.302 --> 08:36.450
and if they're closed, then maybe we'll
tap a tree and make some ourselves.

08:36.517 --> 08:40.703
Does that room have a closet
I can lock him in?

08:41.230 --> 08:44.416
- We'll take it.
- Great.

08:44.525 --> 08:47.586
- They are totally ripping us off!
- Dude, don't worry about it.

08:47.653 --> 08:51.840
I know how to make your money back.
This is a nice hotel. Plenty of amenities.

08:51.907 --> 08:56.219
We just load up on those.
Like those apples. Instead of taking one...

08:56.286 --> 08:59.222
um, I take six.

08:59.706 --> 09:03.518
Great. At $100 an apple, we're there.

09:03.585 --> 09:07.981
Come on, you get the idea. You know,
we'll make our money back in no time.

09:08.090 --> 09:13.028
- Dude, you're shaking.
- It's the sugar. Could you hold the apple?

09:17.724 --> 09:19.242
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:19.309 --> 09:24.206
Joey, I got to tell you, I have been
thinking all day about that scene you did.

09:24.273 --> 09:26.458
- You were amazing.
- Oh.

09:26.650 --> 09:30.003
You know, the writing was good.
And the director's good.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.297
And my costar's good.

09:32.364 --> 09:34.508
But they're not as good as me!

09:35.909 --> 09:38.136
You have to tell me
what happens tomorrow.

09:38.245 --> 09:41.139
I'm going over the script now.
Wanna read lines with me?

09:41.206 --> 09:44.768
Me? Oh, I'm not an actress.

09:44.876 --> 09:47.396
- I can ask Monica.
- Screw her! That part is mine!

09:47.504 --> 09:48.814
Right.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.775
Okay, so, uh, just from the top
of the page right here.

09:51.842 --> 09:53.527
Okay.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.950
Hello, Drake.
I'm surprised to see you here.

10:00.058 --> 10:03.453
- I can't believe you married him.
- Well, what choice did I have?

10:03.520 --> 10:06.915
He was keeping my sister in a dungeon.

10:09.443 --> 10:12.796
So, what about us?
Everything we feel for each other?

10:12.904 --> 10:15.465
It's over. You have to accept that.

10:15.532 --> 10:20.137
How can I, knowing I'll never
hold you in my arms again...

10:20.203 --> 10:24.349
or touch your skin or feel your lips...

10:24.833 --> 10:28.061
knowing I'll never make love to you?

10:28.128 --> 10:31.231
How can I accept
that I can never kiss you again...

10:31.298 --> 10:34.401
when it's all I can do not
to kiss you right now?

10:37.638 --> 10:38.905
Kiss me.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.867
What?

10:42.559 --> 10:43.994
Kiss me.

10:44.102 --> 10:49.583
- Uh, Rach, it doesn't say that.
- No, I'm saying it.

10:49.650 --> 10:52.586
- But...
- Just don't talk.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.678
Well, that's new.

11:10.671 --> 11:14.232
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.193
Um, I've forgotten a couple of things.

11:16.259 --> 11:20.655
Could you have some complimentary
toiletries sent up to my room?

11:20.722 --> 11:24.618
Thank you.
Okay, a toothbrush, toothpaste...

11:24.685 --> 11:30.832
razor, mouthwash, deodorant, floss,
Band-Aids, shaving cream, after shave.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.626
And I feel like I'm forgetting something.

11:32.693 --> 11:37.881
Um, is there anything else you have
that I haven't asked for already?

11:38.073 --> 11:41.384
Yeah, go ahead,
send up some tampons.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.430
- What'd you get?
- USA Today.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.599
Nice. Put it with the others.

11:47.749 --> 11:51.812
And I also got two more apples.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.939
We're four short of a bushel!

11:54.798 --> 11:58.944
God, I feel so alive.
I love being in the country!

11:59.010 --> 12:01.446
Also, got these great
salt and pepper shakers...

12:01.513 --> 12:03.907
- from the restaurant.
- That's not cool.

12:05.016 --> 12:07.828
Dude, none of this is cool.

12:08.311 --> 12:11.998
Look, Chandler, you have to find
the line between stealing...

12:12.065 --> 12:14.459
and taking what the hotel owes you.

12:14.526 --> 12:17.462
For example: a hair dryer, no, no, no.

12:17.571 --> 12:20.757
But shampoos and conditioners,
yes, yes, yes.

12:21.950 --> 12:25.512
Now, the salt shaker is off limits. Ah.

12:25.579 --> 12:29.599
But the salt...

12:29.666 --> 12:32.519
I wish I'd thought this through.

12:32.586 --> 12:36.731
I think I get what you mean, though.
Like, the lamp is the hotel's...

12:36.798 --> 12:40.068
but the bulbs...
Oh, you already got that.

12:40.177 --> 12:43.196
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.116
- Okay, uh, how about this?
- No, no, no.

12:46.224 --> 12:50.787
- You can't take the remote control.
- Yes, but the batteries.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.544
Thank you. Thank you very much.

12:57.652 --> 13:01.172
- Ooh! Let's celebrate with some maple candy.
- No!

13:02.491 --> 13:05.969
At least tell me where you hid it.

13:09.498 --> 13:12.517
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.812
Have you ever had any...

13:15.879 --> 13:20.525
weird, romantic dreams?

13:21.676 --> 13:23.361
Hmm, let me think.

13:23.470 --> 13:28.825
Oh. When I was younger, I used to dream
that I got married to Mayor McCheese.

13:28.892 --> 13:32.078
And on our wedding night,
I ate his head.

13:33.605 --> 13:36.041
Okay.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.668
Well, this is like that...

13:38.735 --> 13:40.754
in no way.

13:40.821 --> 13:44.883
I had a dream last night
that I wanted to kiss Joey.

13:44.950 --> 13:48.011
Wow! You mean like
"kiss him" kiss him?

13:48.078 --> 13:51.514
Oh, yeah.
I mean, it was pretty intense.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.850
- What brought that on?
- I don't know.

13:53.959 --> 13:57.062
Maybe it had to do with the fact
I saw him do a love scene.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.564
- A love scene? With who?
- Olivia.

13:59.673 --> 14:03.068
Olivia?
I thought she was marrying Connor?

14:03.134 --> 14:06.363
Oh, right. Real life more important.

14:06.471 --> 14:09.991
- You think my dream means anything?
- I don't know.

14:10.100 --> 14:14.621
I mean, you saw him do a love scene.
Maybe you don't have a thing for Joey.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.832
Maybe you have a thing for Drake.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.751
Huh...

14:20.110 --> 14:24.631
Well, it was Joey reading
Drake's lines in the dream.

14:24.739 --> 14:28.593
Of course it was.
Trust me, when it comes to psychology...

14:28.660 --> 14:32.013
I know what I'm talking about.

14:32.080 --> 14:36.351
- I took two psych classes in college.
- You took the same class twice.

14:36.459 --> 14:39.104
- It was hard!
- I know.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.107
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:42.173 --> 14:47.237
Here, Monica, look what I got to wear
when I play at your restaurant.

14:50.724 --> 14:53.827
Ah. Ah. Wait.

14:55.186 --> 15:00.125
Right? I think this might even class up
"The Ballad of the Uncircumcised Man."

15:01.860 --> 15:04.587
Um, Phoebe...

15:04.654 --> 15:07.716
maybe I wasn't clear before.

15:07.782 --> 15:11.386
I really love listening
to your music here.

15:11.453 --> 15:14.431
But my restaurant,
it's sort of an upscale place.

15:14.539 --> 15:19.394
Right, yeah, okay. I'll ask the butler
to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.

15:19.461 --> 15:22.439
Phoebe, it's not what you wear.

15:22.505 --> 15:25.775
It's sort of your songs.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.987
I just don't think you should play
at the restaurant anymore.

15:29.930 --> 15:34.701
Oh. Okay. Fine, I'll just...

15:34.768 --> 15:37.620
I'll take the hat back.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.624
There.

15:46.821 --> 15:50.050
Hey, so you guys, the funniest
thing happened at work the...

15:50.158 --> 15:52.343
My songs aren't good enough
for your restaurant?

15:52.452 --> 15:55.138
Okay, we're still on that.

15:55.246 --> 15:58.850
- I didn't say they weren't good enough.
- Then what's wrong with them?

15:58.917 --> 16:02.103
What, they don't go with your
tiny portions of pretentious food?

16:02.212 --> 16:05.565
- Tiny portions?
- Yeah, well, um, "Excuse me.

16:05.632 --> 16:10.945
I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer,
but I can't see it. I can't see it."

16:12.973 --> 16:17.035
- Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
- Well, it's not about quality.

16:17.227 --> 16:20.288
Oh, really?
You wanna talk about quality?

16:20.438 --> 16:24.834
Have you ever heard of a "key"?
It's what some people sing in.

16:24.943 --> 16:29.005
Well, at least all my songs
don't taste like garlic.

16:29.114 --> 16:31.716
Yeah, there are other
ingredients, Monica.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.344
So that's what we're doing.

16:34.411 --> 16:37.514
When I'm in a coffeehouse bopping
along to one of your songs...

16:37.580 --> 16:41.392
- I'm wearing earplugs.
- Earplugs or cloves of garlic?

16:43.253 --> 16:45.522
You know what?
I take back what I said before.

16:45.588 --> 16:49.442
Keep playing at the restaurant, because
with your music driving people inside...

16:49.509 --> 16:51.486
my bar sales
have gone up like crazy.

16:51.553 --> 16:54.656
What are people having,
the garlic martini?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.911
Here's your bill.
We hope you enjoyed your stay.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.915
Oh, we did.
And you still have all your lamps.

17:05.817 --> 17:09.671
- I didn't factor in the room tax.
- Dude, don't worry about it.

17:09.738 --> 17:14.925
I found an unattended maid's cart.
We're way ahead of the game.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.387
- Oh, my God.
- What?

17:17.454 --> 17:20.181
There's something new in the bowl.

17:20.248 --> 17:25.145
- Look, we have enough. Just walk away.
- No, but I want the pine cones.

17:25.920 --> 17:29.774
- There's a forest right outside.
- It's not the same.

17:29.883 --> 17:32.527
Okay, go quick.

17:39.350 --> 17:42.245
Thank you for a delightful stay.

17:50.653 --> 17:53.715
MY maple candy!

17:56.910 --> 18:00.430
<i>The food here at Javu
Will kill you</i>

18:00.538 --> 18:04.184
<i>The food here at Javu
Will kill you</i>

18:04.250 --> 18:09.230
It's just you. I thought someone was
swinging a bag of cats against the wall.

18:09.464 --> 18:14.110
You'd better get back in that kitchen.
The garlic's not gonna overuse itself.

18:14.177 --> 18:16.821
- Okay, you have to stop playing now.
- Why?

18:16.888 --> 18:19.282
The only person my playing
is bothering is you.

18:19.349 --> 18:24.662
- Oh, yeah? Let's settle this. Come on.
- Get your garlic peelers off me.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.248
Excuse me? Excuse me?

18:27.315 --> 18:30.960
Hi, I'm Monica Geller.
I'm the head chef here.

18:31.486 --> 18:35.131
Okay, I was actually expecting
a little applause there, but whatever.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.092
Quick question.
By a show of hands...

18:38.159 --> 18:42.472
how many of you were bothered
by this woman's singing outside?

18:43.081 --> 18:46.935
Okay, okay. How many of you
enjoyed the music outside?

18:48.461 --> 18:49.604
Ha!

18:49.671 --> 18:52.899
Let me ask you this question.
How many thought the music was fine...

18:52.966 --> 18:56.361
but not in keeping with the tone
of the restaurant?

18:56.427 --> 19:02.450
Who identified this restaurant's tone
as "pretentious-comma-garlicky"?

19:02.517 --> 19:08.748
Okay, who thinks the food is delicious
and a little pretension never hurt anyone?

19:09.399 --> 19:13.002
Okay, well, all right, who thinks
the food is fine, the music was fine...

19:13.069 --> 19:16.673
but your evening was ruined
by this incessant poll-taking?

19:20.243 --> 19:22.804
Excuse us.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.600
All right, here's a question.

19:27.667 --> 19:31.729
Uh, who was so worried about
her restaurant being fancy...

19:31.796 --> 19:35.108
that she made a big deal about
her friend playing her music...

19:35.175 --> 19:38.569
and feels really bad about it now?

19:39.512 --> 19:42.198
Well, who was so stupid
and stubborn...

19:42.265 --> 19:44.784
that she lashed out
against her friend's cooking...

19:44.851 --> 19:48.288
which she actually thinks
is pretty great?

19:48.396 --> 19:51.416
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

19:51.608 --> 19:54.669
Hey, you wanna stick around
and I'll whip you up some dinner?

19:54.777 --> 19:59.590
Yeah, as long as it's free.
The food here is ridiculously overpr...

20:02.118 --> 20:07.098
Who hopes the hand-raising thing is still
cute enough that you won't hate me?

20:09.459 --> 20:11.394
- Hey!
- Hey.

20:12.670 --> 20:17.483
Joey, do you have peanut butter
on the back of your head?

20:19.761 --> 20:23.114
Oh, man. I thought I got it all.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.034
How...?

20:26.100 --> 20:27.994
How?

20:28.144 --> 20:30.705
I was making a peanut butter
smoothie, right?

20:30.772 --> 20:35.043
I couldn't find this little plastic thingy
that goes in the top of the blender.

20:35.109 --> 20:39.380
And I thought, "Well, you know,
how important can that be?" Right?

20:39.864 --> 20:41.716
Turns out, very.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.428
Wow, definitely just Drake.

20:45.954 --> 20:48.306
- What?
- How's it going with Drake?

20:48.456 --> 20:51.768
- I don't think it's going very well.
- What?

20:51.876 --> 20:53.811
That scene I saw was so good.

20:53.920 --> 20:58.649
Well, I'm feeling really insecure
about the one we're shooting tomorrow.

20:58.841 --> 21:03.071
Is this that thing you do when you say
you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?

21:03.304 --> 21:05.406
A little.

21:05.473 --> 21:11.954
No, I really am worried. I have to make it
convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.

21:12.021 --> 21:15.124
- So?
- So I've never played that.

21:15.233 --> 21:19.128
Oh, honey, it can't be that hard.
I mean, you've been in love before.

21:19.737 --> 21:23.174
Uh, well, just once...

21:23.241 --> 21:25.635
with you.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.305
Okay. Well, this could be
a little awkward.

21:29.372 --> 21:31.974
I'm just gonna blow past it.

21:32.041 --> 21:35.186
Well, look, can't you just use
that method-actor thing...

21:35.295 --> 21:40.274
where you use your real-life memories
to help you in your performance?

21:40.341 --> 21:42.819
What the hell are you talking about?

21:45.179 --> 21:51.160
All right, look, just, um, try to remember
how you felt when you were in love...

21:51.227 --> 21:54.205
and think about that
when you're playing the scene.

21:54.272 --> 21:55.915
Oh.

21:56.983 --> 22:00.378
Okay. Yeah, I think I can do that.

22:00.445 --> 22:03.423
Yeah. Okay, there's this
party scene coming up.

22:03.489 --> 22:06.050
- Uh-huh.
- And Olivia and her husband are there...

22:06.159 --> 22:11.431
and all Drake wants to do is
grab her and kiss her, but he can't.

22:11.497 --> 22:16.144
That makes me think about those times
I wanted to grab you and kiss you...

22:16.210 --> 22:19.605
but you didn't know, so I would
just pretend everything was cool...

22:19.672 --> 22:21.816
but really it was killing me.

22:23.718 --> 22:27.822
Joey, you never
talked about that before.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.657
Well...

22:29.849 --> 22:32.952
Hey, you know what else I could use?

22:33.019 --> 22:36.456
There's this scene where Drake
sneaks into Olivia's bedroom...

22:36.522 --> 22:41.002
and she doesn't know he's there,
which never happened with us.

22:42.278 --> 22:47.341
I mean, he knows he shouldn't be there,
but he just wants to look at her.

22:48.659 --> 22:50.219
You know?

22:50.286 --> 22:55.391
And I remember all those mornings
before you even put on your makeup...

22:55.458 --> 23:00.938
when I would think to myself,
"My God, she is beautiful."

23:02.548 --> 23:07.695
And it hurt so much because I knew
I could never tell you.

23:10.306 --> 23:15.411
But it was worth it just to be there
looking at you.

23:20.942 --> 23:22.919
Thanks, dude. This is great!

23:33.955 --> 23:36.349
I got you something from Vermont.

23:36.457 --> 23:38.726
Besides tampons and salt?

23:40.211 --> 23:42.021
Oh, my God.

23:42.130 --> 23:45.816
Maple candy. That's so sweet of you.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.819
That's weird, it's empty.

23:49.095 --> 23:54.450
Hi, you guys. What's going on?
You guys wanna hang out, or...?

24:00.690 --> 24:02.625
Do you guys hear a buzzing?
