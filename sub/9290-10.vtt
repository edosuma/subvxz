00:12.200 --> 00:14.664
"Previously on" 24.

00:14.760 --> 00:16.808
- Julia.
- Mr. President.

00:16.904 --> 00:19.847
David is wondering why
I want him to fire Wayne.

00:19.943 --> 00:22.119
- Wayne and I became involved.
- They had an affair.

00:22.216 --> 00:23.847
I think you'll agree, David.

00:23.943 --> 00:26.983
You wouldn't be where you are
without my support over the years.

00:27.079 --> 00:29.798
I've never asked you
for anything in return.

00:29.895 --> 00:31.719
But I'm asking you now.

00:31.814 --> 00:34.918
- Fire Wayne.
- I'm sorry, Alan. I can't do that.

00:35.015 --> 00:38.822
Then you know me well enough
not to be surprised if there are repercussions.

00:38.918 --> 00:40.710
Bauer's with the Salazar brothers
in Mexico.

00:40.805 --> 00:43.397
His transponder signal
stopped working.

00:43.494 --> 00:45.158
We're doing everything
to reestablish contact.

00:45.254 --> 00:48.389
Now tell the Delta units to hold their position
till I get back to you.

00:48.485 --> 00:51.653
- Kim. Do you know how to do a frequency scan?
- Yeah.

00:51.749 --> 00:53.957
We're trying to pick up your
father's transponder signal.

00:54.052 --> 00:56.548
Michelle's already begun the scan.
Coordinate with her.

00:56.645 --> 00:59.524
I have a message from Jack.
The virus that they're going to buy...

00:59.621 --> 01:02.084
Jack is going to take it
from them.

01:02.181 --> 01:05.188
Jack promised to get me and my family
out of here if I help you.

01:05.284 --> 01:07.300
Then help me.

01:07.396 --> 01:11.043
There's been a complication.
Another buyer's interested in the virus.

01:11.140 --> 01:14.116
We'll hold an auction,
and the virus will go to the highest bidder.

01:14.211 --> 01:18.722
Your bid is $225 million.
Hers is 240.

01:18.819 --> 01:21.698
Nina, you win.

01:21.795 --> 01:25.058
You're of no use to us
anymore. You failed!

01:25.155 --> 01:26.883
Ramon, don't do this!

01:26.978 --> 01:29.346
Five hours ago, you were in
an American prison!

01:29.442 --> 01:31.362
And now you're free
because I broke you out!

01:31.457 --> 01:33.794
- We can get the virus!
- How do you get the virus?

01:33.889 --> 01:37.377
The woman, Nina! If I fail,
you get to kill me. Fine.

01:37.474 --> 01:40.065
But if I succeed, the deal will go forward.
We'll be back on track.

01:40.161 --> 01:42.721
We'll all get paid!

01:47.649 --> 01:51.712
The following takes place between
10:00 p.m. And 11:00 p.m.

02:09.407 --> 02:11.295
How many more are coming, huh?

02:15.359 --> 02:17.823
Are they "americanos"
or "federales" or both?

02:38.108 --> 02:40.509
So where are we on this?

02:40.604 --> 02:43.132
Jack's last known position
is here.

02:43.228 --> 02:45.500
N.S.A. Says they might be able
to reposition a satellite...

02:45.596 --> 02:49.052
- but it's gonna take at least two orbits
to get it over.
- That'll be too late.

02:49.148 --> 02:50.971
Sporadic satellite coverage
is probably why...

02:51.068 --> 02:55.387
the sellers of the virus chose that place to meet.

02:55.483 --> 02:58.587
- It's Hector.
- Direct the call through our
system before you answer it.

02:58.683 --> 03:01.178
I wanna trace this on all networks. Remember,
you're gonna need an explanation.

03:01.275 --> 03:03.867
"They haven't heard from you in over two hours."

03:03.963 --> 03:06.747
We're set.

03:10.682 --> 03:13.049
- Ortega.
- Gael, what's going on?

03:13.146 --> 03:16.922
- I've been trying to reach you.
- I was at Division with the bureau chief.
Couldn't talk.

03:17.050 --> 03:20.057
- Is there a problem?
- No. I'm back at C.T.U. Now.

03:20.153 --> 03:21.977
Nobody suspects you
are working with us?

03:22.074 --> 03:24.857
If they did, we wouldn't
be having this conversation.

03:24.953 --> 03:27.928
All right, listen.
We have a problem.

03:28.025 --> 03:30.424
This seller double-crossed us.
He brought in a second bidder.

03:30.521 --> 03:34.425
- Second bidder?
- Yes. S-Some woman named Nina Myers.

03:34.520 --> 03:38.296
Amador held an auction.
We lost.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.728
- So you don't have the virus?
- "No."

03:40.824 --> 03:43.864
- What do you want me to do?
- Bauer says he knows this woman, Nina.

03:43.959 --> 03:46.744
We're going to try to get it through her.
Hold on.

03:48.439 --> 03:50.711
- Gael, it's Jack.
- Jack.

03:50.807 --> 03:54.871
I'm gonna give you a number
to a cell phone Michael Amador's
been using for the last few hours.

03:54.967 --> 03:56.694
Ping it until you get his location.

03:56.790 --> 04:00.727
The number's 011-5255...

04:00.822 --> 04:04.150
3224-0135.

04:04.278 --> 04:07.734
Got it.
Hey. Are you all right?

04:07.829 --> 04:12.469
Yeah. Get back to me on this number
as soon as you've got his location.

04:12.565 --> 04:16.309
One more thing.
Bauer's partner showed up.

04:16.404 --> 04:18.869
- You have him?
- Yes. We have him.

04:18.964 --> 04:21.589
- " Alive?"
- Yes, for now.

04:21.685 --> 04:23.572
Is he working alone
or does he have backup?

04:24.660 --> 04:26.484
Chase Edmunds is
in Field Ops.

04:26.580 --> 04:28.404
I don't have access
to their mandate.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.412
You get access, okay?
What are we paying you for?

04:31.508 --> 04:35.700
If I try, it might blow my cover. Best bet is
to keep Edmunds alive until we find out.

04:35.795 --> 04:38.707
All right.
Track Amador.

04:38.803 --> 04:41.299
Do you have a location on Jack?

04:41.395 --> 04:44.787
Here... Uh, about four miles from
our last contact point.

04:44.882 --> 04:48.210
All right. Tell the Delta units to adjust
their positions and wait for further orders.

04:48.339 --> 04:50.770
- Run a passive triangulation on Amador's phone.
- " Got it."

04:59.090 --> 05:01.297
Kim?

05:01.393 --> 05:03.441
We found your father.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.905
He's undercover with
the Salazars. He's fine.

05:06.033 --> 05:08.657
Thank God. What about Chase?

05:10.673 --> 05:12.561
He's been captured.

05:12.657 --> 05:15.601
- Captured... Is he okay?
- He's alive. They're holding him.

05:15.696 --> 05:19.024
- What do you mean by "holding him"?
- My guess is they're interrogating him.

05:21.264 --> 05:24.560
Once we get the virus,
we'll go in for Chase.

05:26.479 --> 05:29.584
- Thank you for not keeping this from me.
- Sure.

05:31.631 --> 05:33.615
Uh...

05:35.183 --> 05:37.007
Do you need anything else?

05:37.102 --> 05:40.046
No. Just making sure
you're okay.

05:40.142 --> 05:42.830
I'm fine. Thank you.

05:47.022 --> 05:48.846
- Did you tell her?
- About Chase? Yeah.

05:48.942 --> 05:52.558
- But not about Nina?
- No. She doesn't need to know about that now.

06:11.404 --> 06:14.764
Jack? How long will it take
to trace Amador's phone?

06:14.860 --> 06:16.683
If everything goes right,
10 minutes.

06:16.780 --> 06:19.595
I'm going to call our client
and tell them there's been a delay.

06:19.691 --> 06:22.347
I'll see if they're getting
anywhere with his partner.

06:22.443 --> 06:24.811
Good. Let's go.

06:28.395 --> 06:31.498
- "Hector!"
- Sergio.

06:31.594 --> 06:34.410
- What are you doing here?
- My sister says we're going.

06:34.506 --> 06:36.522
She's taking me and my father
away from you.

06:40.489 --> 06:42.794
Did she say when
this would happen?

06:42.890 --> 06:45.417
Soon. But I don't want
to leave you, Hector.

06:45.513 --> 06:48.650
I would never let
that happen.

06:48.745 --> 06:51.721
Okay, now.
You go back to bed...

06:51.817 --> 06:54.088
but don't tell your sister
anything about this, okay?

06:54.185 --> 06:57.096
And I'll make sure
everything works out. Eh?

06:57.193 --> 07:00.872
- You'll talk to her?
- Yes, I'll talk to her. Okay?

07:00.969 --> 07:02.792
Go on.

07:24.294 --> 07:26.214
- How is Chase?
- Holding on.

07:26.310 --> 07:28.134
I'm gonna go with Ramon
to pick up the virus soon.

07:28.230 --> 07:30.758
The second you've got
a chance to get out, take it.

07:30.854 --> 07:33.094
Go down and get Chase.
Tell him to call C.T.U.

07:33.189 --> 07:35.110
They'll know how to get
in touch with the rescue units.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.806
They'll get you and your family out.

07:46.981 --> 07:49.925
- Are you planning on going somewhere?
- What do you mean?

07:50.020 --> 07:54.532
- Don't play games with me, woman.
- Don't play games with "me."
What are you talking about?

07:54.628 --> 07:58.116
Sergio tells me he was packing a bag to go away.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.036
What's so funny?

08:00.132 --> 08:03.108
He was being bad.
Something he picked up from you, I think.

08:03.203 --> 08:05.475
I told him I was taking
him away from here.

08:05.572 --> 08:09.251
- I was trying to keep him in line.
- That's all?

08:09.346 --> 08:12.035
Just trying to keep him in line?

08:12.131 --> 08:15.427
He said he wanted a gun like yours.
I said no.

08:15.522 --> 08:18.626
He got nasty,
so I scared some sense into him.

08:31.490 --> 08:35.232
He's a good boy.
Don't scare him like that.

08:35.328 --> 08:37.889
Don't encourage him
to play with guns.

08:50.624 --> 08:54.207
- "Jack."
- Yeah.

08:54.303 --> 08:56.479
Let's go.

09:09.759 --> 09:12.798
- Adam says we're back in touch with Jack.
- Yeah, we just heard from him.

09:12.894 --> 09:16.158
- How close are we to the virus?
- We have the phone number of the seller...

09:16.254 --> 09:18.077
a Michael Amador.

09:18.173 --> 09:20.925
- We're running a passive triangulation right now.
- Then what?

09:21.021 --> 09:25.437
We pass the location of Amador on to Jack
and let Jack call the shots.

09:25.533 --> 09:28.221
All right.
I'll bring Division up to speed.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.781
Ryan, there's one more thing.

09:30.876 --> 09:32.988
We just found out that
there's another player in the deal.

09:33.084 --> 09:35.868
- Who is it?
- Nina Myers.

09:37.180 --> 09:39.067
I thought we had her restricted
to North Africa...

09:39.164 --> 09:40.988
after the president gave her
exiled immunity.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.739
We did.

09:43.836 --> 09:45.916
Apparently she slipped out.

09:46.012 --> 09:48.283
Jack's trying to get her
to help him.

09:48.379 --> 09:51.963
Help him? She killed his wife.
That's a hard sell.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.075
I don't know the details.

09:54.171 --> 09:56.219
- Does Kim know about it?
- No.

09:56.314 --> 09:58.683
I'd like to keep it
that way for now.

10:00.538 --> 10:02.778
All right.
Keep me updated.

10:25.176 --> 10:27.096
I owe you an apology.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.616
You don't.

10:30.712 --> 10:35.320
Look, if you thought I wasn't fit to do my job,
then you had a duty to report it.

10:35.415 --> 10:39.319
But you know I'd never risk the effectiveness
of this unit just to prove how tough I am.

10:39.415 --> 10:41.303
I know that.
I just felt that people...

10:41.399 --> 10:44.279
I know what you felt.
You made that perfectly clear.

10:47.095 --> 10:50.935
- Yeah?
- " Excuse me, sir."
We need Michelle downstairs.

10:51.030 --> 10:52.982
Yeah, all right.

11:11.284 --> 11:13.812
What? What do you mean
you have to go?

11:13.909 --> 11:17.396
- I have to go.
- Sarah, I am in the middle of a crisis.
I can't just leave.

11:17.492 --> 11:19.476
- I'm sorry, but I have other responsibilities...
- Where are you now?

11:19.572 --> 11:22.836
- I'm here right now.
- Oh, for God's sake.

11:22.932 --> 11:26.483
All right. Okay.

11:36.467 --> 11:38.707
He's very stubborn, Hector.

11:38.802 --> 11:40.691
Move!

11:57.489 --> 12:00.497
C.T.U. Doesn't have your travel plans
in their records.

12:00.592 --> 12:03.984
Did you come down here by yourself?

12:04.081 --> 12:06.193
Tell me,
and this will all be over.

12:07.248 --> 12:09.456
Did you come down here
by yourself?

12:21.647 --> 12:26.415
Keep at it.
If he doesn't crack soon, use gasoline.

12:26.542 --> 12:29.006
Si, patron.

12:48.909 --> 12:50.925
- Are all the agencies up to speed on this?
- Yes. They're coordinating...

12:51.021 --> 12:52.781
with the military
to put a net around the virus.

12:52.876 --> 12:56.045
- The Mexican government?
- Full cooperation. They've given us a free hand.

12:56.140 --> 12:58.989
"Mr. President? May I please have a word?"

12:59.084 --> 13:01.453
Thank you, Jerry.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.363
- Sir.
- Thanks, Jerry.

13:06.156 --> 13:09.035
I just got off the phone with Sullivan.
"He's" pulling his vote.

13:09.164 --> 13:11.403
How many senators have we lost?

13:11.499 --> 13:14.507
Three.
All proteges of Milliken's.

13:14.604 --> 13:16.427
David, I'm sorry, but unless
Milliken calls off his dogs...

13:16.523 --> 13:18.762
we're not gonna get
health care passed.

13:18.859 --> 13:21.451
He's sabotaging a bill that can
benefit millions of people.

13:21.547 --> 13:23.786
What he's doing is showing you that,
not only did he have the power...

13:23.882 --> 13:27.818
to help start your political career,
but he also has the power to put an end to it.

13:30.506 --> 13:32.329
David, you can't afford
to lose this debate...

13:32.425 --> 13:35.273
and fail at getting the most important
legislation of your presidency through.

13:35.401 --> 13:37.226
We'd be handing Keeler this election.

13:37.321 --> 13:41.673
- We haven't lost the Senate vote yet.
- We will.

13:41.769 --> 13:45.769
Unless you give in to his demands
and fire me, we will.

13:48.072 --> 13:50.184
David, you don't have
a choice here.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.584
I told you before...
That's not an option.

13:54.152 --> 13:56.040
Listen, l...

13:58.056 --> 14:01.351
I know you wanna do
the right thing by me.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.367
But I'm the one
who made this mistake.

14:05.351 --> 14:09.735
My affair with Milliken's wife
was... stupid and wrong...

14:09.830 --> 14:13.703
Yes, it was.
But what he's trying to do is worse.

14:13.799 --> 14:16.295
For personal revenge,
he's willing to kill a piece of legislation...

14:16.390 --> 14:19.206
that's good for this country,
and we can't let that happen.

14:21.222 --> 14:23.494
There has to be a way
to get to him.

14:24.550 --> 14:26.918
Yes?

14:27.014 --> 14:29.317
I have Senator Hayes for you, sir.

14:31.142 --> 14:33.285
- Senator.
- Mr. President.

14:33.381 --> 14:35.397
No. Push them off the stacks.
I'll be back in a minute.

14:35.493 --> 14:38.244
- The current files...
- No. Just what I said.

14:38.340 --> 14:42.372
Learn to follow instructions, Justin.

14:49.379 --> 14:51.747
- I have every right to be angry with you.
- I'm sorry...

14:51.875 --> 14:55.619
- but it's a family emergency.
- Well, there are two family emergencies now,
aren't there?

14:55.715 --> 14:59.619
Hi, baby girl.

14:59.715 --> 15:02.082
And of the two, yours is less important.
Don't you think?

15:02.211 --> 15:05.954
- Not to me it's not.
- Your job is in serious jeopardy.

15:06.051 --> 15:07.874
Whatever.

15:13.442 --> 15:15.394
Hector, what did you learn
from Edmunds?

15:15.490 --> 15:18.209
He can take a bullet through the hand without
saying anything useful.

15:26.145 --> 15:28.993
- Gael?
- Yeah. We're tracking Amador.

15:29.089 --> 15:33.056
He's seven miles north of Palo Verde,
moving west on a rural highway.

15:33.152 --> 15:36.896
- Any idea where he's going?
- No. Just get back to me as soon as he's stopped.

15:36.992 --> 15:42.304
They've located Amador. He's on a highway
seven miles north of Palo Verde, moving west.

15:42.399 --> 15:45.087
Must be Highway 14. We should get moving.
We can't let him get too far ahead.

15:45.184 --> 15:47.007
Okay, get everyone ready.

15:47.103 --> 15:49.215
No. You can't ambush Amador
unless you're absolutely certain...

15:49.311 --> 15:51.775
- he's got the virus with him.
- What are you saying we should do?

15:51.870 --> 15:54.111
Let him lead us to Nina.

15:54.207 --> 15:57.758
When we're sure they've got the virus,
then we go in, but not with an army of men.

15:57.855 --> 15:59.678
You have to let me
go in alone.

15:59.774 --> 16:01.630
You are not going
anywhere alone.

16:01.726 --> 16:04.126
- I'm not letting you out of my sight.
We go together.
- Ramon...

16:04.254 --> 16:08.349
Hector, you're better off here. And make sure
that everyone is ready, just in case.

16:08.445 --> 16:11.325
Jack, give me the phone.

16:12.350 --> 16:14.237
You're driving.

16:23.389 --> 16:25.949
You're still not asleep?

16:28.764 --> 16:30.588
It's okay, Sergio.

17:29.623 --> 17:31.863
Papa!

17:31.959 --> 17:35.351
- What do they want with that man?
- I don't know, but at least he's still alive.

17:35.447 --> 17:37.270
Get everything ready.
We're leaving.

17:37.367 --> 17:40.439
- Ramon's gone. Hector's resting.
This is our best chance.
- No! We can't!

17:40.534 --> 17:42.998
- Please, don't argue! I need you to help me.
- What do you want me to do?

17:43.094 --> 17:45.270
Do something to the trucks
so they can't follow us.

17:45.366 --> 17:48.789
Pull wires, whatever.
Then get Sergio ready and keep him quiet.

17:48.886 --> 17:50.262
Put him in the truck
and wait for me.

17:50.357 --> 17:52.981
- What are you going to do?
- What I have to. Now go.

17:53.078 --> 17:55.670
Be careful!

18:14.611 --> 18:16.660
Emilio.
Do you have a light?

18:16.755 --> 18:19.603
Sure.

19:08.175 --> 19:10.064
Julia.

19:10.159 --> 19:12.623
It's been a long time.

19:12.719 --> 19:15.535
Hi.

19:17.295 --> 19:19.119
Thanks for meeting me.

19:21.199 --> 19:24.911
I guess you're here because my husband
is trying to force the president to fire you.

19:25.006 --> 19:28.398
Yeah, well, there's much more at stake here
than just my job, you know.

19:28.494 --> 19:30.317
It's about my brother...

19:30.414 --> 19:33.229
being able to run his administration the way
that he sees fit.

19:33.325 --> 19:38.317
Now, it's not fair to the people of this country
that the president be extorted.

19:38.413 --> 19:41.133
- I do love it when you get all noble.
- Julia.

19:41.229 --> 19:45.196
What am I supposed to do?
All this is out of my control.

19:45.293 --> 19:47.181
No, it's not.

19:47.308 --> 19:49.292
It's not, and I think
you know that.

19:51.372 --> 19:54.156
Everybody thinks
Alan dominates you.

19:54.252 --> 19:56.396
The truth is he needs you.
You know that.

19:58.443 --> 20:02.635
- Tell him you'll leave him if he doesn't back off.
- He'd never believe me.

20:02.732 --> 20:05.355
Make him believe you.

20:08.907 --> 20:10.730
I miss you.

20:16.106 --> 20:18.027
Do you miss me?

20:19.274 --> 20:21.258
Oh, what difference
would it make?

20:21.353 --> 20:24.202
It could make a lot
of difference.

20:30.857 --> 20:32.745
Oh, Julia, stop it.

20:32.872 --> 20:34.697
We can't.

20:36.041 --> 20:38.376
Do you think of me?

20:38.473 --> 20:40.296
Don't do this.

20:40.392 --> 20:43.432
It's a simple question.
Do you think about me?

20:47.176 --> 20:49.064
Yes.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.615
Yes, I think about you.

20:52.711 --> 20:55.048
But it doesn't
mean anything.

20:55.143 --> 20:58.823
I think about you,
and it does mean something.

20:58.919 --> 21:02.214
I didn't come here for this.

21:02.311 --> 21:04.614
You came here because
you wanted something.

21:05.735 --> 21:08.358
I want something too.

21:08.454 --> 21:10.470
I like being
Mrs. Alan Milliken.

21:13.350 --> 21:18.565
But that does not have
to have anything to do with you and me.

21:20.805 --> 21:23.109
Come back to me.

21:23.205 --> 21:27.429
That's what I want in return.

21:30.884 --> 21:33.412
It worked once.

21:33.508 --> 21:35.780
It can work again.

21:40.516 --> 21:43.460
It never worked.

21:43.556 --> 21:45.731
Not for me.

21:51.938 --> 21:55.139
Then I'm afraid
I can't help you.

22:05.378 --> 22:07.906
Talk to me, you bastard!

22:08.001 --> 22:12.705
- No!
- What you don't understand...

22:12.802 --> 22:16.257
What you don't understand is if you don't talk,
Hector will take it out on me!

22:16.353 --> 22:18.497
Talk to me!

22:18.593 --> 22:21.600
Eduardo! Back off.

22:21.696 --> 22:24.769
Hector thinks he might talk to me.

22:31.776 --> 22:35.551
Tell these men what they want to know...

22:35.679 --> 22:37.888
and your suffering will end.

22:37.983 --> 22:40.575
You won't be killed,
I swear.

22:40.671 --> 22:42.655
Why should I believe you?

22:42.751 --> 22:44.799
Because if you don't,
they'll burn you alive.

22:46.111 --> 22:48.030
He's a stubborn one,
isn't he?

22:48.159 --> 22:50.046
We can handle him.

22:58.846 --> 23:03.325
Check his pockets! He's got a phone!

23:04.957 --> 23:07.612
There's a gun on the table.

23:15.132 --> 23:16.956
Aaah!

23:19.996 --> 23:24.507
- What are you doing?
- I gotta stop the bleeding, or I could die.

23:43.771 --> 23:47.993
- Come on. We have to go.
- You need a gun.

23:58.393 --> 24:00.537
- Stay down, Sergio! Stay down!
- What's going on?

24:00.633 --> 24:02.521
Everything's going
to be fine!

24:03.865 --> 24:06.488
Come on! Come on! Let's go!

24:13.047 --> 24:15.448
Hurry! Hurry! Get down! Get down!

24:20.183 --> 24:22.391
Where are you going?

24:22.487 --> 24:24.759
- Hector wants me to pick up something for him.
- What?

24:24.855 --> 24:27.223
It's none of your business.

24:52.180 --> 24:54.580
- Papa, what's happening?
- It's okay, Sergio! Stay down!

24:54.708 --> 24:58.004
" Get him!"

25:04.308 --> 25:07.092
Claudia!

25:28.818 --> 25:31.986
Thank you.

25:32.081 --> 25:34.193
Thank you.

26:19.790 --> 26:22.126
Chloe.

26:23.533 --> 26:25.709
Are Delta teams
in position yet?

26:25.806 --> 26:28.845
Yes, they're in the area. As soon as we give
the okay, they'll go in to pick up Chase.

26:28.941 --> 26:32.717
All right. Make sure everyone knows
this is subordinate to obtaining the virus.

26:32.813 --> 26:34.861
- Yep. It's in the brief.
- And once we have Chase...

26:34.957 --> 26:38.669
link in Division, District and someone
from the attorney general's office.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.717
A lot of people
want answers from him.

26:45.259 --> 26:47.948
- What was that?
- Nothing.

26:55.532 --> 26:58.603
Is this your child?

26:58.699 --> 27:01.322
Yes, and she hasn't been
interfering with my work.

27:01.418 --> 27:03.402
Technically, there's no specific rule
preventing me from bringing her...

27:03.498 --> 27:07.082
There's no specific rule
because it's common sense. Now get rid of it.

27:07.178 --> 27:09.642
If I could, I would.
Unfortunately, my babysitter hit me...

27:09.738 --> 27:11.690
with some very
unprofessional behavior.

27:11.818 --> 27:14.537
I want the baby out of here, Chloe.
Now.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.746
Or find someone else
to do your job.

27:16.842 --> 27:20.649
Parents are a protected group,
Mr. Chappelle. This is not fair.

27:31.273 --> 27:35.496
Amador's stopped,
about 200 yards up a dirt road...

27:35.592 --> 27:40.103
that intersects with Highway 14,
about two miles west of Rancho Guadalupe.

27:40.200 --> 27:43.176
Okay. Good work.
We'll find him.

27:43.272 --> 27:45.447
Gael said Amador stopped
about half a mile up the road.

27:45.543 --> 27:48.615
- So what do we do?
- Nina's either with him now,
or she will be any minute.

27:48.711 --> 27:51.271
We've gotta find a way
to isolate her.

28:12.197 --> 28:14.821
Let me see the nightscope.

28:18.276 --> 28:22.180
" One, two..."

28:22.277 --> 28:24.100
three.

28:24.196 --> 28:28.292
- Okay, I'm ready to go in.
- I told you... I'm not letting you out of my sight.

28:28.388 --> 28:30.532
Ramon, I am trained
to do this.

28:30.627 --> 28:32.548
If I go in myself,
I "might" succeed.

28:32.675 --> 28:34.980
If we go in together,
both of us will get killed.

28:35.076 --> 28:37.859
- How long?
- As long as it takes.

28:37.956 --> 28:40.867
You're gonna have to start trusting me.
I want this money as bad as you do.

28:40.995 --> 28:43.075
- I'll trust you when we have the virus.
- Let me make that happen.

28:43.171 --> 28:46.242
I promise you...
I can make her work with us.

28:46.338 --> 28:48.418
You can watch me through the nightscope.
As soon as you see...

28:48.514 --> 28:50.914
that I've entered the building safely,
go back to the main road.

28:51.042 --> 28:53.922
Just in case Amador tries to mobilize
his resources outside this perimeter...

28:54.049 --> 28:56.770
we've gotta be ready,
okay?

28:58.018 --> 29:00.321
All right. Go.

29:49.886 --> 29:51.709
All right. All right.

30:34.042 --> 30:36.250
Soon as it's done.
That's all.

31:06.072 --> 31:09.207
The funds are ready to be transferred.
When do I get the virus?

31:09.304 --> 31:11.799
I'll call you with the location
in half an hour.

31:11.895 --> 31:14.935
You'll transfer 50% of the funds then,
as agreed.

31:15.031 --> 31:17.399
I don't like jumping
through all these hoops.

31:17.495 --> 31:20.471
The hoops are here
to protect us, Nina.

31:20.566 --> 31:22.967
Just wait here
for my call.

31:28.150 --> 31:30.390
Let's go!

31:40.821 --> 31:43.925
Freeze!

31:44.020 --> 31:46.677
Just take it easy.
Take it easy. I'm unarmed.

31:46.773 --> 31:50.260
The Salazars... they just wanted me to set up
a meeting with your employer.

32:17.330 --> 32:19.698
"Nina! Don't move!"

32:21.426 --> 32:24.690
Drop the gun.

32:25.969 --> 32:27.793
Get back in the church.

32:38.225 --> 32:40.944
Take a seat.

32:47.248 --> 32:50.351
Don't worry.
If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead by now.

32:50.448 --> 32:53.520
Put the briefcase down.

33:17.133 --> 33:20.589
- Tony, it's Chase. He just called in.
- All right. Source the call.

33:22.445 --> 33:25.292
- Chase, where are you?
- The truck we're in broke down.

33:25.389 --> 33:28.013
As far as I can tell, we're about 15 miles east
of the Salazars' base camp.

33:28.108 --> 33:29.932
You should be able
to lock onto this cell.

33:30.029 --> 33:33.228
We got Delta teams in the area.
We'll send a chopper as soon as we triangulate.

33:33.324 --> 33:36.556
- What about Jack?
- He went with Ramon Salazar
to find Amador and the virus.

33:36.652 --> 33:39.404
- How long ago?
- About half an hour.

33:39.500 --> 33:42.699
Tony, can you tell the chopper
I'm bringing two people out with me...

33:42.796 --> 33:44.843
and the body of the woman
who helped me escape?

33:44.940 --> 33:46.955
- Who was she?
- Claudia.

33:47.051 --> 33:49.611
It's Hector Salazar's girlfriend.
I've got her father and her brother.

33:49.707 --> 33:51.594
Got 'em. There's a Delta team less than
10 minutes away.

33:51.723 --> 33:54.667
- Can you hang tight for 10?
- I don't know. Just get 'em here.

33:54.763 --> 33:56.586
Just sit tight.
They're on their way.

33:56.682 --> 33:59.339
And can you tell Kim that...

33:59.434 --> 34:02.730
- Tell her I'll call her when I'm on safe ground.
- Yeah. You got it.

34:02.826 --> 34:05.066
Ah...

34:05.161 --> 34:08.777
Claudia.

34:13.321 --> 34:15.145
Mia Claudia.

34:34.759 --> 34:38.087
So, Jack, if you didn't come here to kill me,
why are you here?

34:38.215 --> 34:41.286
- I need to talk to you alone.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.

34:44.646 --> 34:47.463
How much is your buyer
paying you?

34:47.558 --> 34:49.830
Two million,
once I deliver the virus.

34:49.927 --> 34:52.326
The Salazars are willing
to pay you a lot more.

34:52.454 --> 34:54.981
- How much more?
- What is this?

34:55.078 --> 34:56.870
- Shut up.
- This guy shouldn't be breathing.

34:56.966 --> 35:01.285
I'm handling it.
How much more, Jack?

35:01.414 --> 35:04.293
At least 10 times more than
what you're getting paid right now.

35:04.421 --> 35:06.373
Really?

35:07.397 --> 35:09.541
That's a pretty
great deal.

35:11.781 --> 35:14.149
Except, what happens when
my buyer doesn't get his virus?

35:14.245 --> 35:16.036
You know he's just gonna
hunt me down and kill me.

35:16.132 --> 35:19.140
You know with that kind of money
you could disappear and never be found.

35:19.236 --> 35:22.436
Yeah, and what about you?

35:22.531 --> 35:25.923
The Salazars are paying me enough money
to do whatever I want for the rest of my life.

35:27.651 --> 35:32.099
I don't believe you, Jack.
I think you're still working for C.T.U.

35:32.195 --> 35:34.018
Well, you're wrong.

35:34.115 --> 35:37.442
Come on, Jack.
You're not the type of guy to sell out.

35:39.042 --> 35:40.995
You'd do anything
for your country.

35:41.122 --> 35:42.946
There was a time
when that was true.

35:43.043 --> 35:46.114
But what did it ever get me?
I lost everything!

35:46.210 --> 35:49.474
When I went undercover with the Salazars,
I had to give them my soul.

35:49.570 --> 35:52.866
When I brought Ramon Salazar in,
what was waiting for me?

35:52.961 --> 35:55.297
No one, nothing!

35:57.249 --> 35:59.073
What about Kim?

36:00.768 --> 36:04.640
She never forgave me for
what happened to her mother.

36:07.168 --> 36:10.720
I want to give her most of the money...
Help her try and get through everything.

36:13.216 --> 36:17.343
Okay, so,
say you are working alone.

36:17.439 --> 36:19.264
I killed your wife.

36:19.359 --> 36:22.623
What's gonna keep you from killing me
the first chance you get?

36:22.719 --> 36:24.991
I don't have a choice.

36:25.086 --> 36:28.062
I broke Ramon Salazar out
of an American prison.

36:28.159 --> 36:30.590
I can never
go back there again.

36:30.719 --> 36:33.502
This is my one shot
at a big score.

36:35.998 --> 36:39.069
After that, I swear to you,
I just wanna disappear.

36:40.733 --> 36:43.902
We've wasted enough time,
Nina. You kill him...

36:43.997 --> 36:46.461
or I'm calling in.

36:48.701 --> 36:50.588
Fair enough.

37:06.428 --> 37:07.740
Aaah!

37:13.115 --> 37:15.003
What are you up to, Jack?

37:22.107 --> 37:25.818
" Let me in."

37:32.922 --> 37:34.970
Oh, thank you.

37:35.065 --> 37:37.689
Just down here in this conference room.

37:42.073 --> 37:44.984
- I went to see Julia.
- What?

37:45.113 --> 37:47.289
Just to see if she would
help us with Alan.

37:56.855 --> 37:59.544
- And?
- She said no.

37:59.640 --> 38:03.287
Listen, I've been thinking,
and, uh...

38:03.383 --> 38:05.751
you don't have
an alternative here, David.

38:06.807 --> 38:09.174
This is my mess.
I'll take the heat.

38:09.271 --> 38:13.398
- Let me resign.
- I may ask you to when this is over.

38:13.494 --> 38:15.894
But it won't be because
Milliken is forcing my hand.

38:18.102 --> 38:21.493
Wayne.

38:21.622 --> 38:25.142
I've been doing some thinking, too,
and there is an alternative.

38:25.237 --> 38:29.173
If Milliken wants to play dirty,
we have to lower ourselves to his level.

38:29.270 --> 38:31.189
By doing what?

38:34.965 --> 38:36.788
Give me a moment.

39:14.609 --> 39:17.137
- Hello?
- Sherry?

39:17.233 --> 39:19.121
David.

39:20.561 --> 39:22.897
David, what... what's wrong?

39:22.993 --> 39:24.912
I need your help.

39:25.041 --> 39:27.121
All right.
I'm listening.

39:27.217 --> 39:29.329
I'm downtown.
I need to see you tonight.

39:29.424 --> 39:31.600
Tell me more.

39:31.696 --> 39:35.280
I can't say much over the phone.
It's about Alan Milliken.

39:37.712 --> 39:41.232
- Fine.
- I'll send a car.

40:16.748 --> 40:19.053
You really did break Salazar
out of prison.

40:19.149 --> 40:21.581
I'm not the man
you knew before.

40:21.708 --> 40:25.420
Well, I don't know about that.

40:26.571 --> 40:29.836
For $20 million,
I'm gonna keep an open mind.

40:33.707 --> 40:37.003
So, Jack...

40:37.099 --> 40:40.107
if we're gonna go forward with this,
I have to know one thing.

40:42.059 --> 40:44.810
Are you gonna be able to forgive me
for killing Teri?

40:44.907 --> 40:48.458
If I wanted revenge, Nina,
I would have killed you already.

40:48.554 --> 40:50.378
You know that.

40:53.962 --> 40:55.786
It's like I said...

40:55.881 --> 41:00.073
All I wanna do is finish this deal
and disappear for good.

41:17.800 --> 41:19.677
Convince me.
