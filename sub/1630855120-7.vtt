Fatal Attraction...

00:08.736 --> 00:10.638
"You are fantastic."

00:10.638 --> 00:11.605
<i>MAN Well, he's definitely leaving</i>

00:11.605 --> 00:12.640
<i>the door open.</i>

00:12.640 --> 00:13.774
<i>Leaving it up to you</i>

00:13.774 --> 00:15.042
<i>to walk through it, though.</i>

00:15.042 --> 00:15.943
But that is what he wants me

00:15.943 --> 00:17.278
to do, though?

00:17.278 --> 00:18.779
<i>She's building a world</i>

00:18.779 --> 00:20.714
<i>in her fucking head
because you were mad</i>

00:20.714 --> 00:22.516
you were gonna have to wait
to be a fucking judge, man.

00:23.417 --> 00:26.320
"Ruined" is such a weird word

00:26.320 --> 00:27.621
to use about people,

00:27.621 --> 00:29.323
<i>about their lives, but</i>

00:29.323 --> 00:31.325
<i>you've been seen.</i>

00:31.325 --> 00:32.493
She's a stalker.

00:32.493 --> 00:33.994
I don't even know
where she lives.

00:33.994 --> 00:35.896
Yeah, I need to...

00:35.896 --> 00:38.199
figure out what to do about
how your prints are all over

00:38.199 --> 00:39.900
<i>the bathroom sink...</i>

00:39.900 --> 00:42.503
Get the fuck up.
<i>...kitchen, bedframe</i>

00:42.503 --> 00:43.971
that you say you've never seen.

00:43.971 --> 00:47.474
I did not kill her,
and I'm going to prove it.

01:09.230 --> 01:10.631
Thank God for Mike.

01:10.631 --> 01:12.633
It's a shitshow up there
with all the reporters.

01:12.633 --> 01:14.001
He snuck me out the back

01:14.001 --> 01:16.570
before they can
get their shit together.

01:16.570 --> 01:18.873
They found the body?

01:20.708 --> 01:22.343
Did they actually find it?

01:22.343 --> 01:24.345
I mean, I don't know
for sure, but...

01:25.880 --> 01:27.748
They're not exactly
sharing information with me

01:27.748 --> 01:29.516
at this point, but,
given everything that's happened

01:29.516 --> 01:30.618
with Brooker
and everything else,

01:30.618 --> 01:32.753
I think we have to assume yes.

01:51.872 --> 01:52.973
Sorry.

01:54.475 --> 01:56.143
We should go.

02:00.648 --> 02:03.684
<i>Julia called to make sure
the bail money went through,</i>

02:03.684 --> 02:06.020
and to check on you.

02:06.887 --> 02:09.623
God, those guys, they're...

02:09.623 --> 02:11.725
Believers.

02:11.725 --> 02:14.361
So who's gonna prep me
to testify?

02:14.361 --> 02:17.798
Because, no offense, but I think
it should be him. I'm worried

02:17.798 --> 02:19.333
there's just gonna be
a part of me that doesn't

02:19.333 --> 02:21.235
take it seriously because
of all the fights we've had

02:21.235 --> 02:24.038
over the years,
and how I always won them.

02:24.038 --> 02:26.340
Also, I was thinking,
the jury's gonna be

02:26.340 --> 02:27.508
reading the room
from the get-go.

02:27.508 --> 02:29.143
We got to be a united front.

02:29.143 --> 02:31.045
Yeah, so, I had a lot of time
to think about this

02:31.045 --> 02:32.313
last night while
I wasn't sleeping,

02:32.313 --> 02:35.449
and what I'm thinking is...

02:35.449 --> 02:38.752
I can't tell them
that I had an affair.

02:38.752 --> 02:41.221
- What?
- If I do, the jurors,

02:41.221 --> 02:43.324
they're not gonna believe
anything else I have to say.

02:43.324 --> 02:45.259
I'm just gonna be the bastard
who betrayed his family,

02:45.259 --> 02:48.495
and the prosecutors will play
that card 'cause it works.

02:48.495 --> 02:50.364
I can't let them
convict me of murder

02:50.364 --> 02:51.765
just 'cause they don't like me.

02:51.765 --> 02:54.935
Okay, but that is...
that's an enormous risk.

02:54.935 --> 02:57.204
I mean, does Cabral,
is he on board with it?

02:57.204 --> 02:58.539
I'm not gonna ask him.

02:58.539 --> 02:59.773
I can't tell him the truth
about the affair

02:59.773 --> 03:01.675
because, if I testify and I lie,

03:01.675 --> 03:04.011
I'm perjuring myself,
and he's suborning it.

03:04.011 --> 03:06.613
He's a pain in the ass,
but he's not unethical.

03:06.613 --> 03:07.815
What's the point
of having a lawyer

03:07.815 --> 03:09.316
if you can't confer about...

03:09.316 --> 03:11.118
His only job is to show
that there's no proof

03:11.118 --> 03:12.853
that I did it. He doesn't want
to know the truth.

03:12.853 --> 03:14.455
No good defense attorney does.

03:14.455 --> 03:15.889
And since I didn't
commit the crime,

03:15.889 --> 03:17.825
all I have to do
is give him a strategy

03:17.825 --> 03:20.127
- that he can use.
- Which is what?

03:21.695 --> 03:24.098
Stalker? Delusional stalker?

03:24.098 --> 03:27.735
Yes, stalker,
delusional, obsessive.

03:27.735 --> 03:30.471
What couldn't happen
to a person like that?

03:30.471 --> 03:33.040
If you testify, and they ask you
about the affair on the stand,

03:33.040 --> 03:36.643
you're gonna have to lie, and
you're not a good liar, Beth.

03:37.611 --> 03:40.414
I can't let you do that.

03:40.414 --> 03:42.449
They want to hear that I believe

03:42.449 --> 03:44.852
that you would never be capable
of killing somebody.

03:44.852 --> 03:46.453
We'll be fine. I don't care.

03:46.453 --> 03:48.722
I do.

Quiet. Quiet, you.

05:32.426 --> 05:35.129

07:22.035 --> 07:24.805
Yeah, she's up.

07:24.805 --> 07:28.242
How am I supposed
to do that, exactly?

07:28.242 --> 07:30.477
Or do you want me to haul
a sick kid to the library

07:30.477 --> 07:33.313

the periodicals room

07:33.313 --> 07:35.315

07:36.750 --> 07:38.385
Yep.

07:38.385 --> 07:41.154
Yep. We'll be here.

07:46.526 --> 07:48.829
Making a federal case
about how hard it is for her

07:48.829 --> 07:50.631
to get any time at work

07:50.631 --> 07:53.267
to call home and check in,

07:53.267 --> 07:55.569
like she even knows
what a hard time at work is.

07:55.569 --> 07:57.638
Walk in my shoes, why don't you?

07:57.638 --> 07:59.873
Walk in them
at these interviews.

07:59.873 --> 08:02.075
Some kid who can't even
hold my jock

08:02.075 --> 08:03.543
asking about my bona fides

08:03.543 --> 08:07.047
when I could do their job
with a quarter of my ass.

08:07.047 --> 08:09.416
Not to mention,
I went into engineering

08:09.416 --> 08:12.119
to work in the defense industry,
combat systems,

08:12.119 --> 08:14.655
not a goddamn utility company.

08:14.655 --> 08:17.557
She acts like there's
no difference, a job's a job.

08:17.557 --> 08:21.361
How do you even talk
to a woman like that?

08:23.163 --> 08:25.499
You can't.

08:25.499 --> 08:28.335
You can try, but they're just
never gonna get it.

08:31.405 --> 08:34.007
Here we go.
Where's the clothespins?

08:39.012 --> 08:40.647
What's your teacher's
name again?

08:40.647 --> 08:42.182
Miss Ross.

08:42.182 --> 08:44.885
She always has spit
in the corners of her mouth.

08:47.554 --> 08:50.023
Ah, make sure you tell her
about these.

08:50.023 --> 08:51.591
Make sure she knows,

08:51.591 --> 08:54.227
while she was boring
the other kids to death all day,

08:54.227 --> 08:56.396
we made our own sparklers.

09:17.517 --> 09:20.020
Where's your father?

09:21.154 --> 09:23.523
Where'd he say he was gonna be?

09:25.025 --> 09:27.561
Well, he said
it was Henry's birthday.

09:27.561 --> 09:29.896
Like I'm really supposed
to believe he'd choose to spend

09:29.896 --> 09:31.865
four and a half hours
with Henry,

09:31.865 --> 09:34.067
- no matter what day it is.
- Why not?

09:34.067 --> 09:35.602
Aren't they, like,
friends from college?

09:35.602 --> 09:38.372
So, he's with Henry?

09:38.372 --> 09:40.307
Out, with Henry?

09:40.307 --> 09:43.043
If that's what he said.

09:43.043 --> 09:44.745
He did say that.

09:44.745 --> 09:46.246
And so did you,

09:46.246 --> 09:49.049
which is how I know
it's bullshit.

09:50.150 --> 09:52.719
It must feel so...

09:52.719 --> 09:55.021
wicked and fun

09:55.021 --> 09:57.758
to have someone
to put things over on together.

09:57.758 --> 09:59.659
Hmm?

09:59.659 --> 10:02.329
Especially someone so stupid.

10:03.096 --> 10:04.731
Can you even remember a time

10:04.731 --> 10:07.734
when the two of you weren't
ganging up against me?

10:08.935 --> 10:10.971
Me, either.

10:10.971 --> 10:13.573
You are so proud

10:13.573 --> 10:16.777
in thinking because
he trusts you to lie for him

10:16.777 --> 10:18.912
that means he loves you.

10:18.912 --> 10:20.380
When what it really means

10:20.380 --> 10:23.583
is that
he doesn't love you, either.

10:24.951 --> 10:28.455
No, no, I know. What do I know?

10:28.455 --> 10:29.656
Nothing.

10:29.656 --> 10:33.160
I don't know anything about him,
compared to you.

10:33.160 --> 10:36.163
I don't know anything
about anything.

10:36.163 --> 10:39.800
I guess, eventually,
we will see who knows what.

10:41.668 --> 10:43.270
Or not.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.706
Or maybe, one of these days,

10:46.706 --> 10:49.242
you'll come home and...

10:49.242 --> 10:52.078
I just won't be here anymore.

10:55.615 --> 10:57.317
<i>Just talk to her a little,</i>

10:57.317 --> 10:59.252
<i>keep her entertained.
That so much to ask?</i>

10:59.252 --> 11:01.455
I don't even know
what her name is.

11:01.455 --> 11:03.690
That's why you're acting
like such a brat

11:03.690 --> 11:06.760
over someone asking
for one small favor?

11:06.760 --> 11:09.996
It's Abby. Okay? Jesus wept.

11:09.996 --> 11:12.165
Hi.
- Hey, ladies.

11:13.934 --> 11:16.136
Hope you weren't waiting
too long.

11:16.136 --> 11:18.438
Abby, this is my daughter Alex.

11:18.438 --> 11:20.941
She took too long
to get ready because

11:20.941 --> 11:22.843
she was so excited
to come meet you.

11:22.843 --> 11:24.411
Have you been here before?

11:24.411 --> 11:26.780
Because I think
that you are gonna

11:26.780 --> 11:28.815
love it.

11:32.819 --> 11:34.988
WOMAN
Let's go sit, okay?

11:34.988 --> 11:36.923
You just went in my room
and took it?

11:36.923 --> 11:38.492
- For her?
- What are you talking about?

11:38.492 --> 11:41.161
What were you gonna say
when I realized it was gone?

11:41.161 --> 11:44.064
Were you just gonna
let me think I was crazy?

11:44.064 --> 11:46.299
I forgot, that's all.

11:46.299 --> 11:48.935
Honestly, I didn't think
a 15-year-old would still care

11:48.935 --> 11:51.638
about a toy, that's probably why
it slipped my mind, but...

11:51.638 --> 11:54.641
It's not like
I was trying to upset you.

11:54.641 --> 11:56.309
I'll just tell the kid
I made a mistake,

11:56.309 --> 11:57.577
and you still want that thing.

11:57.577 --> 11:59.913
Okay? I'm sure
she'll understand.

11:59.913 --> 12:02.482
I'll make it up to her, somehow.

12:02.482 --> 12:04.017
Okay?

12:04.017 --> 12:06.653
Come on, they're waiting.

12:09.723 --> 12:13.193
<i>Deeply troubled,
delusional fixation.</i>

12:13.193 --> 12:15.362
Then Brooker...

12:15.362 --> 12:18.031
...rush to judgement,
only suspect,

12:18.031 --> 12:20.467
tunnel vision...
I mean,

12:20.467 --> 12:23.203
this is how innocent people
end up on trial.

12:23.203 --> 12:26.072
It can happen to any one of you.

12:26.072 --> 12:27.541
I like that,

12:27.541 --> 12:29.175
bringing the jury into that.
I like that.

12:29.175 --> 12:31.545
Mm. (laughs) Uh,
political pressure, headlines,

12:31.545 --> 12:35.282
victim of a broken system
you served so faithfully,

12:35.282 --> 12:38.151
heinous crime
you did not commit.

12:38.151 --> 12:40.120
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:40.120 --> 12:43.123
- Ballpark?
- Yeah.

12:43.123 --> 12:44.524
Okay.

12:44.524 --> 12:47.894
That's the defense's
opening statement.

12:47.894 --> 12:50.130
Now you tell me,

12:50.130 --> 12:52.332
Deputy D.A. Gallagher,

12:52.332 --> 12:55.468
what is Deputy D.A. Ruiz's
opening statement gonna be?

12:55.468 --> 12:58.505
<i>Daniel Gallagher
is an entitled man.</i>

12:58.505 --> 13:00.340
<i>His father was an influential</i>

13:00.340 --> 13:03.176
<i>and well-connected judge
who got him a powerful position</i>

13:03.176 --> 13:05.378
<i>as a prosecutor
fresh out of law school.</i>

13:05.378 --> 13:07.714
RUIZ and DAN:
From his first day in that job,

13:07.714 --> 13:10.250
Daniel Gallagher
did what he wanted

13:10.250 --> 13:11.718
when he wanted,

13:11.718 --> 13:13.153
with whomever he wanted.

13:13.153 --> 13:16.656
Because that is what men
of privilege do.

13:16.656 --> 13:18.458
Mm-hmm.

13:18.458 --> 13:22.495
They think nothing
of engaging in sexual affairs

13:22.495 --> 13:24.864
outside of their marriage

13:24.864 --> 13:27.867
with women who work for them.

13:27.867 --> 13:30.403
In this case, that woman

13:30.403 --> 13:33.673
was Alexandra Forrest, whose job

13:33.673 --> 13:35.408
was to support

13:35.408 --> 13:38.278
and advocate
for victims of crime.

13:38.278 --> 13:41.514
And when Dan Gallagher got...

13:41.514 --> 13:44.417
tired of Alex Forrest,

13:44.417 --> 13:46.920
he told her to go away,

13:46.920 --> 13:48.922
and he expected her

13:48.922 --> 13:51.091
to do what he said.

13:51.091 --> 13:52.726
But she didn't.

13:52.726 --> 13:55.895
And she made it very clear
that she wouldn't.

13:55.895 --> 13:57.130
So, when a man of privilege

13:57.130 --> 13:59.165
is faced with a threat

13:59.165 --> 14:00.934
to his family,

14:00.934 --> 14:04.337
his career, his reputation...

14:06.139 --> 14:08.041
...what do you think

14:08.041 --> 14:10.343
he might do?

14:10.343 --> 14:12.679
As a homicide prosecutor,

14:12.679 --> 14:15.515
my privilege is to speak
for the dead.

14:15.515 --> 14:18.585
So, today,
I speak for Alex Forrest,

14:18.585 --> 14:21.254
and I ask you, in her name,

14:21.254 --> 14:24.290
to find Daniel Gallagher guilty

14:24.290 --> 14:26.059
of murder.

14:27.193 --> 14:28.795
Thank you.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.932
We just wanted to
kind of talk, generally,

14:32.932 --> 14:34.401
about goals and...

14:34.401 --> 14:36.436
In the sense that
we're objective oriented

14:36.436 --> 14:38.905
and competitive...
Which makes sense,
it's law school, but...

14:38.905 --> 14:42.008
And, as long as what
we're doing is productive

14:42.008 --> 14:44.344
for everyone, then

14:44.344 --> 14:45.912
we don't have to get along,

14:45.912 --> 14:47.614
- but...
- Just tell her.

14:48.581 --> 14:50.250
It isn't working.

14:50.250 --> 14:54.354
We just approach things differently.

14:56.056 --> 14:57.924
Okay.

14:57.924 --> 15:00.460
Say more about that.

15:00.460 --> 15:01.995
Okay, like,

15:01.995 --> 15:04.397
whenever you leave me a message,
and I call you back

15:04.397 --> 15:07.701
right away, you act like
I'm bothering you,

15:07.701 --> 15:10.470
but if I wait to call back,

15:10.470 --> 15:12.472
you freak out about
how long it took me.

15:12.472 --> 15:15.008
You called me stupid
for going through index cards

15:15.008 --> 15:16.676
in the "wrong" order.

15:16.676 --> 15:18.111
You didn't hand in my
legal writing assignment

15:18.111 --> 15:19.713
with yours
like you said you would,

15:19.713 --> 15:21.881
and then, when I saw it
in your bag, you were like,

15:21.881 --> 15:25.051
"Oh, you just did such a bad job
on it, I wanted to protect you."

15:25.051 --> 15:27.654
When I said I didn't have time
to run hypos

15:27.654 --> 15:29.589
with you on my mom's birthday,

15:29.589 --> 15:30.890
you threw a cup of coffee...

15:30.890 --> 15:32.092
I didn't throw it at you.

15:32.092 --> 15:33.893
Does that matter?

15:39.199 --> 15:41.034
We just think it'd be better

15:41.034 --> 15:43.269
if you went to another group.

15:43.269 --> 15:44.971
For you, too.

15:46.573 --> 15:47.941
Just so you know,

15:47.941 --> 15:51.010
there hasn't been
a single session since September

15:51.010 --> 15:54.013
that Mark hasn't
rolled his eyes at least once

15:54.013 --> 15:56.015
while you were speaking.

15:56.015 --> 15:59.586
And Paula doesn't understand
how you got into

15:59.586 --> 16:01.488
any law school,
let alone this one.

16:01.488 --> 16:03.490
And she also wonders if you've
ever had a single thought

16:03.490 --> 16:04.858
that you didn't feel
the need to express

16:04.858 --> 16:07.660
out loud, so...

16:07.660 --> 16:10.063
Oh... your watch, the one

16:10.063 --> 16:12.198
that you lost at the gym?

16:12.198 --> 16:15.001
Why don't you ask Leo
where that went?

16:17.170 --> 16:20.573
<i>So I finally just told them
that I was sick of it.</i>

16:20.573 --> 16:23.343
I don't want to deal with
the resentfulness and the-the

16:23.343 --> 16:26.045
passive aggression anymore.
It's distracting.

16:26.045 --> 16:28.848
Especially when I can handle
my own workload myself,

16:28.848 --> 16:30.016
so...

16:30.016 --> 16:32.652
- I mean, I would hope so, honey.
- Right?

16:32.652 --> 16:35.188
Well, it's not like
you're at Yale or something.

16:35.188 --> 16:36.556
It's sad those idiots

16:36.556 --> 16:38.391
need a study group
at a state law school,

16:38.391 --> 16:40.560
not impressive that you don't.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.562
UW's...

16:42.562 --> 16:44.697
It's in the top 25%.

16:44.697 --> 16:47.233
Hey, before I forget,

16:47.233 --> 16:49.869
Lacey and I are
going skiing Friday.

16:49.869 --> 16:52.472
Her sister has a condo
on Schweitzer Mountain.

16:52.472 --> 16:55.041
You hate skiing.

16:55.041 --> 16:57.010
What? No, I don't.

16:57.010 --> 16:59.712
Your mom just never wanted
to go, so we didn't.

16:59.712 --> 17:01.447
She said that you hated it,
and you never

17:01.447 --> 17:04.050
wanted to go
'cause you're so bad at it.

17:04.050 --> 17:06.386
I mean, that is just
complete bullshit,

17:06.386 --> 17:08.588
but have it your way.

17:09.923 --> 17:12.625
I like how you
always have one of her little

17:12.625 --> 17:15.495
poison poppers in the chamber
these days, though.

17:15.495 --> 17:18.164
Little blindside jabs

17:18.164 --> 17:19.566
all stored up.

17:19.566 --> 17:21.234
When she was still alive,
who knew

17:21.234 --> 17:23.570
you were such a fan of hers?

17:23.570 --> 17:25.471
She sure didn't.

17:27.473 --> 17:29.475
Anyway, we'll be there
through next week.

17:29.475 --> 17:33.012
Doing Turkey Day in Idaho.

17:34.781 --> 17:37.050
So happy Thanksgiving
in advance.

18:01.140 --> 18:03.543
<i>That's what's surprising,
that's what's so crazy.</i>

18:03.543 --> 18:05.445
<i>That's what you should be
asking yourself.</i>

18:05.445 --> 18:07.380
<i>I mean, the real question
should be,</i>

18:07.380 --> 18:09.816
<i>how she could leave you,
her daughter,</i>

18:09.816 --> 18:12.385
<i>who she's supposed to love unconditionally,</i>

18:12.385 --> 18:13.887
<i>for life?</i>

18:13.887 --> 18:17.056
<i>Why a mother would abandon
her own child,</i>

18:17.056 --> 18:18.691
<i>her daughter?</i>

18:18.691 --> 18:20.159
<i>That's what's surprising,
that's what's so crazy.</i>

18:20.159 --> 18:22.128
<i>That's what you should be
asking yourself.</i>

18:22.128 --> 18:25.298
<i>Why a mother would abandon
her own child, her daughter?</i>

18:25.298 --> 18:27.867
<i>How could she leave you?
She's supposed to love you.</i>

18:36.042 --> 18:37.277
Ah!

18:39.145 --> 18:40.647
Ah.

19:14.019 --> 19:17.189
Have you had any therapy before?

19:17.189 --> 19:19.591
No. Are you a doctor?

19:19.591 --> 19:21.860
No. I'm a doctoral intern

19:21.860 --> 19:24.196
in clinical psychology.

19:24.196 --> 19:26.398
My final training year.

19:26.398 --> 19:28.901
So that's why this is free.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.804
No. The university's counseling

19:31.804 --> 19:34.606
service is provided
as part of your tuition,

19:34.606 --> 19:37.176
so it's actually not free.

19:38.744 --> 19:41.547
If you feel more comfortable
with a medical doctor,

19:41.547 --> 19:43.916
- I can refer you.
- It's fine. It's...

19:43.916 --> 19:46.385
It's fine.

19:46.385 --> 19:48.420
Well, in the meantime,

19:48.420 --> 19:50.122
I can try to help you figure out

19:50.122 --> 19:53.058
- what you might...
- I just feel like
there's no one.

19:55.694 --> 19:59.064
That sounds very hard

19:59.064 --> 20:01.667
and isolating.

20:02.801 --> 20:04.870
Can you talk about
some recent examples

20:04.870 --> 20:07.106
that made you feel this way?

20:07.106 --> 20:09.274
Like, Thanksgiving
having just happened,

20:09.274 --> 20:11.477
a lot of complicated feelings

20:11.477 --> 20:14.480
tied up with
those kinds of gatherings.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.982
I can see that
being especially tough.

20:16.982 --> 20:19.952
What was your holiday like?

20:21.787 --> 20:24.623
I bet yours
was really nice, right?

20:24.623 --> 20:27.059
Mm...

20:27.059 --> 20:29.695
I actually kind of boycott
the holidays these days.

20:31.397 --> 20:35.300
Just... family issues.

20:36.802 --> 20:38.837
What did you do instead?

20:38.837 --> 20:42.541
Went to the movies
with my husband.

20:42.541 --> 20:43.876
What'd you see?

20:43.876 --> 20:46.512
Uh, <i>The Waterboy.</i>

20:48.781 --> 20:51.283
Do you have kids?

20:51.283 --> 20:53.852
No.

20:53.852 --> 20:56.555
Maybe once I get my doctorate.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.390
What does your husband do?

20:58.390 --> 21:02.861
He's a research fellow here,
in population health.

21:05.564 --> 21:08.400
I don't know what that is.

21:23.749 --> 21:26.218
I've got my witness list here.

21:27.319 --> 21:28.720
Okay,

21:28.720 --> 21:32.157
who is Stanley Forrest?

21:32.157 --> 21:33.592
Who?

21:33.592 --> 21:36.829
He's the victim's father.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.265
She told me her father was dead.

21:40.265 --> 21:41.800
Be cool.

21:42.601 --> 21:44.103
Chill.

21:54.246 --> 21:56.348
I thought the whole point of
law school was not to have to do

21:56.348 --> 21:58.283
- things like internships.
- I guess, but...

21:58.283 --> 22:00.919
they rotate you
through all the bureaus

22:00.919 --> 22:03.155
and the programs, so...

22:03.155 --> 22:06.258
you see basically the whole
Seattle justice system.

22:06.258 --> 22:07.559
It's pretty fascinating.

22:07.559 --> 22:09.728
Take your word for it, I guess.

22:09.728 --> 22:11.063
I mean, if you were thinking
about trying

22:11.063 --> 22:12.865
to actually be the city attorney

22:12.865 --> 22:14.399
or the D.A. even,
I guess that might be something.

22:14.399 --> 22:18.270
My favorite rotation
was the crime survival services.

22:18.270 --> 22:20.372
So, you help
the victims negotiate

22:20.372 --> 22:23.909
the trial and
the sentencing process,

22:23.909 --> 22:25.978
you know, you comfort them,

22:25.978 --> 22:27.579
connect with them.

22:27.579 --> 22:30.015
It was really satisfying.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.851
I don't know,
it-it made sense to me.

22:33.785 --> 22:36.054
Some of the staff there,
they have MSWs,

22:36.054 --> 22:38.824
but you can do it
with a bachelor's degree.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.927
- Okay, so what?
- So...

22:41.927 --> 22:44.329
law school's not for me.

22:44.329 --> 22:46.565
I just... Not really.

22:46.565 --> 22:48.600
Not right now. I don't know.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.068
And then this job opened up,

22:50.068 --> 22:51.737
right,
at the Crime Advocacy Program,

22:51.737 --> 22:53.472
and I thought,
"Oh, this is, it's a sign."

22:55.908 --> 22:57.609
What kind of sign?

22:57.609 --> 23:00.012
The sign for someone who knows
they can't cut the mustard?

23:00.012 --> 23:01.413
No one's gonna even know

23:01.413 --> 23:03.048
what this thing is
you're talking about,

23:03.048 --> 23:04.483
or if they do,
they don't know it's a job.

23:04.483 --> 23:06.051
What the fuck
am I supposed to tell them?

23:06.051 --> 23:08.453
God. When I think
about how hard I worked

23:08.453 --> 23:11.023
to set you up so now
you can just throw it all away.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.758
I'm sorry, what exactly
did you do again?

23:12.758 --> 23:14.159
Other than never hold
a fucking job

23:14.159 --> 23:16.061
'cause you were always
too amazing to work.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.996
No, please, tell me again
how you'd be running

23:17.996 --> 23:20.199
fucking Naval System
Ordnance Command

23:20.199 --> 23:22.768
if every single other person
in the world

23:22.768 --> 23:24.937
wasn't a dick
who was jealous of you.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.143
You finished here, sir?

23:33.812 --> 23:37.382
Ask my daughter.
She knows everything.

23:40.452 --> 23:42.854
<i>If your father was a paraplegic,</i>

23:42.854 --> 23:45.057
confined to a wheelchair
your whole life,

23:45.057 --> 23:48.227
it would be simple for you
to accept that he can't walk.

23:48.227 --> 23:49.895
But what he actually is
is someone

23:49.895 --> 23:52.497
who can't give you
anything you want or need.

23:52.497 --> 23:55.534
But so, fighting back,

23:55.534 --> 23:59.304
pointing out the lies,
calling him out, it's useless.

23:59.304 --> 24:01.940
You can't get milk

24:01.940 --> 24:03.542
from a hardware store.

24:05.143 --> 24:07.980
Winning can't be the goal

24:07.980 --> 24:10.182
when winning
isn't possible, right?

24:10.182 --> 24:13.385
What does the goal have to be?

24:14.453 --> 24:17.723
Not getting destroyed.

24:17.723 --> 24:20.058
Not getting destroyed
is the goal.

24:20.058 --> 24:22.995
So what do we have to do
to help you with that?

24:26.565 --> 24:29.001
One of the other advocates

24:29.001 --> 24:31.870
was talking the other day
about a case,

24:31.870 --> 24:33.705
this client, um,

24:33.705 --> 24:36.208
her ex-husband's
a sociopath, I think.

24:36.208 --> 24:39.111
And so,
Aaron was advising her to

24:39.111 --> 24:42.347
limit all contact
to just over the phone,

24:42.347 --> 24:44.316
so he can't see
her body language,

24:44.316 --> 24:46.652
he can't read
her facial expressions

24:46.652 --> 24:49.054
and, like, feed off them.

24:49.054 --> 24:51.323
And he also said
that she should smile,

24:51.323 --> 24:52.824
even if she doesn't
want to smile,

24:52.824 --> 24:55.127
just smile
when she's talking to him

24:55.127 --> 24:56.862
because it'll change her voice

24:56.862 --> 24:59.898
and-and confuse him.

24:59.898 --> 25:02.734
Well, if you think
you can do it,

25:02.734 --> 25:04.202
might be worth a try.

25:04.202 --> 25:07.005
It is true nothing makes
your father happier

25:07.005 --> 25:09.441
than seeing the effect
he has on you.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.616
It's five minutes till, so...

25:17.616 --> 25:19.885
we have to switch gears now.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.954
We don't have to,
but, yeah, okay.

25:22.954 --> 25:25.824
After the voice mails
this past weekend, again,

25:25.824 --> 25:28.760
- we absolutely do.
- Which wouldn't happen
if you would just

25:28.760 --> 25:30.262
give me your direct line,

25:30.262 --> 25:31.963
so we could just talk
and be done with it, but...

25:31.963 --> 25:34.366
Be here with me now, please.

25:36.335 --> 25:38.403
I'm not mad at you.

25:38.403 --> 25:42.207
So, over this next week, you
don't have to worry about it,

25:42.207 --> 25:44.443
or leave messages asking if I am

25:44.443 --> 25:48.080
or telling me you just need
to hear me say I'm not,

25:48.080 --> 25:51.016
because I'm not mad
at you, Alex.

25:51.016 --> 25:53.518
Am I mad at you?

25:53.518 --> 25:54.986
No.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.991
<i>STANLEY How long are we gonna do this?</i>

25:59.991 --> 26:03.095
<i>How many work emergencies am I
supposed to believe you have?</i>

26:03.095 --> 26:05.731
<i>I mean, isn't the point
of a "job"</i>

26:05.731 --> 26:07.199
<i>working with crime victims</i>

26:07.199 --> 26:09.434
<i>that the emergency
already happened?</i>

26:10.535 --> 26:13.038
<i>You don't have meals,
you don't drink coffee,</i>

26:13.038 --> 26:14.172
<i>you work all day and night?</i>

26:14.172 --> 26:16.641
I told you, I'm busy, really.

26:16.641 --> 26:18.310
I don't have any time, but...

26:18.310 --> 26:20.779
when things open up,
I definitely

26:20.779 --> 26:22.547
will be able
to make something...

26:22.547 --> 26:24.783
<i>What's funny?</i>

26:24.783 --> 26:27.152
- What?
<i>- You sound weird.</i>

26:28.320 --> 26:30.122
<i>You're not the only person
who's busy, you know.</i>

26:30.122 --> 26:32.891
<i>I know you think you are,
but you're not.</i>

26:32.891 --> 26:36.128
After intensive investigation,
the victim's body was recovered

26:36.128 --> 26:37.929
from the water
in Marina Del Rey.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.065
Upon this discovery,
we sent the body

26:40.065 --> 26:43.034
to the medical examiner's office
for an autopsy,

26:43.034 --> 26:45.303
which was conducted
by Herbert Hong,

26:45.303 --> 26:48.840
the Chief Medical Examiner,
and Dr. Hong's report showed...

26:48.840 --> 26:50.208
...a large crack.

26:50.208 --> 26:51.810
As a result, I removed the brain

26:51.810 --> 26:54.679
and noted a massive contusion
to the left hemisphere.

26:54.679 --> 26:56.982
These discoveries led me
to conclude cause of death

26:56.982 --> 26:58.550
was blunt force trauma.

26:58.550 --> 27:00.886
The forensic team recovered
multiple fingerprints

27:00.886 --> 27:04.122
in the deceased's apartment,
which were sent for analysis.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.091
According to
Detective Lenz's report...

27:06.091 --> 27:07.592
...24 were not hits,

27:07.592 --> 27:09.361
meaning those prints
belonged to individuals

27:09.361 --> 27:10.962
who are not in the system.

27:10.962 --> 27:13.498
But ten prints did match
with one individual.

27:13.498 --> 27:15.000
The defendant.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.203
...denied ever having been
inside Ms. Forrest's apartment.

27:18.203 --> 27:20.972
H-He also denied ever having
a personal relationship

27:20.972 --> 27:22.641
with Ms. Forrest. However, upon

27:22.641 --> 27:24.810
subsequent interviews
with other parties...

27:24.810 --> 27:26.278
I saw her wink at someone,

27:26.278 --> 27:28.113
and when I looked to see who,

27:28.113 --> 27:29.648
I saw it was Dan Gallagher.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.551
And then Ms. Forrest
motioned to Mr. Gallagher,

27:32.551 --> 27:34.486
like to tell him
that he had something,

27:34.486 --> 27:36.388
some-some food on his face
or something.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.023
After a short conversation,

27:38.023 --> 27:40.425
I then used the restroom,
and when I returned,

27:40.425 --> 27:43.028
I noted both the defendant
and Ms. Forrest

27:43.028 --> 27:44.629
had left the premises.

27:44.629 --> 27:47.365
I next attempted to speak
to a, uh, Mr. Rodney Scanlon,

27:47.365 --> 27:50.535
who works as the head bartender
at Andolini's Restaurant.

27:50.535 --> 27:52.237
I don't recall.

27:52.237 --> 27:54.473
Did you ever see the defendant

27:54.473 --> 27:57.175
in Andolini's with Ms. Forrest?

27:57.175 --> 27:58.577
I don't recall.

27:58.577 --> 28:00.378
Have you ever heard

28:00.378 --> 28:02.180
that the defendant
and Ms. Forrest

28:02.180 --> 28:03.882
were involved
in a personal relationship?

28:03.882 --> 28:05.784
I don't recall.

28:05.784 --> 28:08.753
He subsequently came
to my office to request

28:08.753 --> 28:10.555
she be assigned
to another case he had pending.

28:10.555 --> 28:12.757
Hmm. Was that unusual?

28:12.757 --> 28:15.727
Yes. It was the kind of thing
that, before then,

28:15.727 --> 28:17.662
he would've had
someone else do for him,

28:17.662 --> 28:19.331
or done over the phone.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.433
The defense has indicated that

28:21.433 --> 28:24.202
Ms. Forrest struggled with...

28:24.202 --> 28:27.105
That she was, in their words,

28:27.105 --> 28:29.140
unstable.

28:29.941 --> 28:32.277
Did you ever see any signs

28:32.277 --> 28:33.778
of instability?

28:33.778 --> 28:37.415
No. Our job is very stressful, psychologically,

28:37.415 --> 28:40.785
so I-I try to watch
for the effects of that,

28:40.785 --> 28:42.287
manage for them.

28:42.287 --> 28:44.289
Alex never confided in me

28:44.289 --> 28:46.091
that she was struggling
in any way,

28:46.091 --> 28:47.993
and I never saw
any sign of it in her.

28:47.993 --> 28:50.662
I saw a caring
and dedicated advocate.

28:52.364 --> 28:54.666
One of the best we ever had.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.136
Have you talked to him about it?

28:58.136 --> 29:00.171
Are you going to?

29:00.171 --> 29:02.674
Well, putting that aside
for right now,

29:02.674 --> 29:04.476
let's try to honor

29:04.476 --> 29:06.311
this decision
with an explanation

29:06.311 --> 29:08.179
before you make it.

29:08.179 --> 29:10.482
What are you looking for
with this move?

29:10.482 --> 29:13.151
What other ways
could it be good for your life?

29:13.151 --> 29:15.320
How-how am I
supposed to know how

29:15.320 --> 29:17.923
a place I've never even been to
is gonna be good for me

29:17.923 --> 29:19.257
before I even get there?

29:19.257 --> 29:21.927
It's not a question
about Los Angeles.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.995
It's a question about

29:23.995 --> 29:26.131
what you might be trying
to go toward

29:26.131 --> 29:28.433
- and why.
- Clean slate.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.136
A fresh start.

29:31.136 --> 29:33.271
Less conceptual, more specific.

29:33.271 --> 29:34.973
I am going toward

29:34.973 --> 29:37.142
a job.

29:37.142 --> 29:39.477
Something that I'm good at,

29:39.477 --> 29:42.914
you know,
but on a bigger scale and-and

29:42.914 --> 29:46.017
there's just more opportunity,
there's more need.

29:46.017 --> 29:48.253
Plus, a new set of colleagues

29:48.253 --> 29:50.822
you don't have any
uncomfortable history with,

29:50.822 --> 29:52.724
too, right?

29:55.694 --> 29:58.597
You're kind of
all over the place today.

29:58.597 --> 30:00.565
It's fine, but I just--
I don't know, I thought

30:00.565 --> 30:02.300
I should point it out in case
you're not doing it on purpose.

30:02.300 --> 30:05.670
I just want to make sure
this very big move

30:05.670 --> 30:07.339
has a goal,

30:07.339 --> 30:10.275
besides running away
from your father.

30:10.275 --> 30:12.243
Because you know that saying,

30:12.243 --> 30:14.779
"Wherever you go,
there you are."

30:15.847 --> 30:19.417
<i>He said you'd been gone
for ten days. Ten!</i>

30:21.653 --> 30:24.222
<i>You have any idea
what that was like?</i>

30:24.222 --> 30:26.891
<i>Getting laughed at
by this asshole because</i>

30:26.891 --> 30:29.861
<i>I don't know
my own fucking daughter moved?</i>

30:29.861 --> 30:31.696
<i>Or where she went?</i>

30:31.696 --> 30:33.565
<i>I should call the cops
and report you missing.</i>

30:33.565 --> 30:35.934
<i>Tell them
you're a danger to yourself.</i>

30:35.934 --> 30:38.403
<i>That's what you deserve.</i>

30:38.403 --> 30:40.105
<i>You expect people
to care about you</i>

30:40.105 --> 30:41.673
<i>when you treat them like this?</i>

30:41.673 --> 30:43.842
<i>Not to mention,
if no one knows where you are,</i>

30:43.842 --> 30:46.411
<i>what do you think you're gonna
do when you need something?</i>

30:46.411 --> 30:48.346
<i>Because you are gonna
need something, honey.</i>

30:48.346 --> 30:51.683
<i>You're a fucking
black hole of need.</i>

31:04.200 --> 31:06.236
<i>I'm diving into
all this stuff again.</i>

31:06.236 --> 31:08.171
<i>It's taking me
right back to college,</i>

31:08.171 --> 31:10.674
<i>finding a copy of</i> Man And His
Symbols <i>in the used bookstore.</i>

31:10.674 --> 31:12.475
<i>I feel like I should be
wearing a rugby shirt</i>

31:12.475 --> 31:13.910
<i>and drinking Snapple.</i>

31:13.910 --> 31:15.545
Anyway,

31:15.545 --> 31:17.180
<i>there is some stuff
about the Toni Wolff affair</i>

31:17.180 --> 31:18.648
<i>in the Hannah memoir.</i>

31:18.648 --> 31:20.050
<i>About how the three of them
were able</i>

31:20.050 --> 31:21.384
<i>to coexist through it,</i>

31:21.384 --> 31:23.286
<i>with Jung's wife
being fully aware</i>

31:23.286 --> 31:25.855
<i>and Toni being aware
she was aware.</i>

31:46.609 --> 31:48.211
<i>STELLA Skater buddy Ellen.</i>

31:48.211 --> 31:50.313
Hey. What you up to?

31:50.313 --> 31:52.816
<i>Um... just got home
from Pilates,</i>

31:52.816 --> 31:55.852
<i>which means
I'm about to order tacos.</i>

31:55.852 --> 31:57.954
<i>You want in?</i>

31:57.954 --> 32:00.757
- Be right over.
<i>- Cool.</i>

32:06.396 --> 32:08.998
<i>I wanted you to have this.</i>

32:08.998 --> 32:10.667
What is it?

32:10.667 --> 32:12.402
It's my paperwork

32:12.402 --> 32:14.437
that I need to submit
to a judge for a new trial.

32:14.437 --> 32:17.440
Why I deserve one.
Alternative suspects,

32:17.440 --> 32:19.876
people who weren't
looked at the time.

32:19.876 --> 32:22.412
- Like who?
- Well, like a guy she dated,

32:22.412 --> 32:23.947
a guy who lived in the building,

32:23.947 --> 32:26.683
people who were identified
by fingerprints

32:26.683 --> 32:29.419
who hadn't been arrested
at the time, things like that.

32:30.420 --> 32:32.388
Now that it's ready,
we're gonna do it.

32:32.388 --> 32:34.724
We're gonna submit it.

32:37.227 --> 32:39.863
And I-I wanted you to have it.

32:39.863 --> 32:41.297
Obviously,
you don't have to read it.

32:41.297 --> 32:42.999
No, I want to read it.

32:42.999 --> 32:45.001
Okay.

32:45.001 --> 32:46.836
That's great.

32:48.004 --> 32:49.572
It just seems like...

32:51.674 --> 32:53.543
...like there's-there's so...

32:53.543 --> 32:55.712
much of it. I mean, I...

32:55.712 --> 32:57.514
I get about the fingerprints,

32:57.514 --> 32:59.749
but did they not even, like...

32:59.749 --> 33:01.651
try to find out
any of this stuff then?

33:01.651 --> 33:03.853
Why wouldn't they look
at other people in her life?

33:03.853 --> 33:05.722
Because I lied.

33:09.726 --> 33:11.261
I lied.

33:11.261 --> 33:14.564
And I made it easy for them.

33:14.564 --> 33:17.066
But I hope this makes...

33:17.066 --> 33:20.036
anything...

33:20.036 --> 33:22.806
easier for you.

33:28.711 --> 33:31.948
It was clear to me that he was
coming from her apartment.

33:31.948 --> 33:35.451
But you didn't actually
see him leave it.

33:35.451 --> 33:37.654
Ms. Rauch,
when was the last time

33:37.654 --> 33:39.422
you had your vision checked?

33:39.422 --> 33:40.623
Can you recall?

33:40.623 --> 33:43.159
This year, last year?

33:43.159 --> 33:45.295
Probably around...

33:45.295 --> 33:46.563
three years ago?

33:46.563 --> 33:48.231
Did you ever see my client

33:48.231 --> 33:51.801
inside Ms. Forrest's apartment?

33:53.203 --> 33:54.537
No.

33:54.537 --> 33:57.874
Did you ever see my client
with Ms. Forrest?

33:57.874 --> 33:59.843
No.

34:00.610 --> 34:04.180
Get out! Nothing. We're nothing.

34:04.180 --> 34:06.082
We are nothing.

36:35.064 --> 36:38.201

You sure?</i>

36:40.470 --> 36:42.472
Yeah, I'm sure.

36:43.339 --> 36:45.708
<i>Well, since you're calling
all this attention</i>

36:45.708 --> 36:48.745
<i>to how long it's been,
how did you want me to be?</i>

36:48.745 --> 36:51.981
<i>Or were you thinking
about me at all?</i>

36:53.816 --> 36:55.752
<i>I mean,
is there an upward trajectory?</i>

<i>You keep talking

<i>who runs the show there.
How did you get that job?</i>

37:00.056 --> 37:03.192
<i>Or maybe you'd rather
just be told what to do forever.</i>

37:03.192 --> 37:05.728
<i>That's what it seems like, honestly.</i>

37:06.529 --> 37:09.132
- Is it an apology?
<i>- No. For what?</i>

37:09.132 --> 37:11.567
<i>I don't know.
For the things that you said,</i>

37:11.567 --> 37:13.536
<i>for the way that you said them.</i>

37:13.536 --> 37:15.071
<i>Okay, wait.</i>

37:15.071 --> 37:17.774
<i>Which time
that you overreacted was this?</i>

37:17.774 --> 37:19.776
<i>Okay, then,
how about you apologize</i>

37:19.776 --> 37:22.478
<i>for how
you fucking ruin everything?</i>

37:22.478 --> 37:24.047
<i>What are we ruining again?</i>

37:24.047 --> 37:26.349
<i>What... what is there to ruin?
Seriously...</i>

37:26.349 --> 37:29.152
<i>...tell me, Alex,
because I... I don't know.</i>

37:29.152 --> 37:31.788
<i>He's your age,
but he's not married?</i>

37:31.788 --> 37:33.389
<i>Is he divorced?</i>

37:33.389 --> 37:35.758
No.

37:38.694 --> 37:40.363
<i>Well, that's just weird.</i>

37:40.363 --> 37:41.998
<i>You don't think that's weird?</i>

37:41.998 --> 37:43.533
No, I don't think that's weird.

37:43.533 --> 37:45.101
I think that he's really busy.

37:45.101 --> 37:48.137
Like, he's busy being head
of Major Crimes Bureau.

37:48.137 --> 37:50.440
He's so busy,
they offered him a judgeship,

37:50.440 --> 37:52.642
and he had to turn it down.

37:52.642 --> 37:54.410
<i>I think
something's wrong with him.</i>

37:54.410 --> 37:56.779
There must be, right,

37:56.779 --> 37:59.115
because he's interested in me?

37:59.916 --> 38:01.818
<i>Is that what I said?</i>

38:01.818 --> 38:03.820
<i>But you probably don't have</i>

38:03.820 --> 38:05.221
<i>to worry about it, anyway,</i>

38:05.221 --> 38:07.123
<i>because it doesn't sound
like he is.</i>

38:07.123 --> 38:08.958
Okay.

38:08.958 --> 38:11.227
So you still think
that there's nothing to ruin?

38:11.227 --> 38:14.197
<i>Well, he's a lawyer.
You say he's a good one.</i>

38:14.197 --> 38:16.032
<i>I'm not a lawyer,
but even I know--</i>

38:16.032 --> 38:18.201
<i>you leave a door open,
someone's gonna come in.</i>

38:18.201 --> 38:19.936
Right, so I should
just call him.

38:19.936 --> 38:22.138
Shit.

38:22.138 --> 38:24.874
<i>Maybe you're a little bit jealous.</i>

38:24.874 --> 38:26.909
<i>Of what?</i>

38:26.909 --> 38:28.945
That I finally found somebody

38:28.945 --> 38:32.682
who loves me
and who wants to be with me.

38:32.682 --> 38:34.383
<i>Why would I be jealous?</i>

38:34.383 --> 38:36.319
<i>I'm happy for you.</i>

38:36.319 --> 38:38.554
<i>You make me sound like
some kind of monster.</i>

38:40.123 --> 38:42.558
<i>Just manage your expectations,
that's all.</i>

38:42.558 --> 38:45.695
<i>It's bad to go into something
already thinking it's forever.</i>

38:45.695 --> 38:48.664
<i>Just let it be
what it's going to be.</i>

38:48.664 --> 38:50.233
<i>Why is it a jealous thing</i>

38:50.233 --> 38:52.068
<i>to remind you
to live in the moment?</i>

38:52.068 --> 38:55.004
<i>I'm just protecting you, honey.</i>

38:55.004 --> 38:57.473
<i>That's all
I'm ever trying to do.</i>

38:57.473 --> 38:59.575
And after she found out

38:59.575 --> 39:02.345
he was married,
what happened then?

39:02.345 --> 39:05.148
Well, she confronted him,
and he turned on her.

39:06.249 --> 39:08.050
He told her if she tried
to make any trouble for him,

39:08.050 --> 39:10.853
he'd start by making sure
she lost her job.

39:10.853 --> 39:13.923
And what did you think
at that point?

39:13.923 --> 39:15.925
I was devastated for her.

39:15.925 --> 39:18.995
And I was... worried.

39:18.995 --> 39:22.098
The way she was describing him,
he was a...

39:22.098 --> 39:23.933
a completely different person

39:23.933 --> 39:27.403
than the one I'd been
hearing about.

39:27.403 --> 39:29.405
Instead of a loving boyfriend, suddenly,

39:29.405 --> 39:34.277
there's this angry,
powerful guy, and...

39:34.277 --> 39:38.648
my daughter's not
his girlfriend now,

39:38.648 --> 39:41.350
she's his problem.

39:43.152 --> 39:45.388
And what happened next,
Mr. Forrest?

39:45.388 --> 39:47.690
She called me.

39:47.690 --> 39:50.793
She was hysterical.

39:50.793 --> 39:53.896
She said
she'd tried to talk to him.

39:54.931 --> 39:56.766
Then he got violent,

39:56.766 --> 39:59.168
put hands on her.

40:00.736 --> 40:03.172
She'd been scared for her life.

40:07.777 --> 40:10.613
I didn't know what to do.

40:10.613 --> 40:13.382
I felt so helpless.

40:13.382 --> 40:15.885
I just told her...
told her to get out of there,

40:15.885 --> 40:18.588
come home, I'd take care of her.

40:26.062 --> 40:28.864
And she said
she was going to, but before

40:28.864 --> 40:31.367
she could leave, he...

40:31.367 --> 40:33.803
You broke her,
and then you killed her!

40:33.803 --> 40:35.938
She was my best friend!

40:38.140 --> 40:40.376
Nothing further, Your Honor.

40:55.157 --> 40:59.028
I'm very sorry
for your loss, Mr. Forrest.

41:01.063 --> 41:03.466
One question.

41:05.801 --> 41:09.572
You have no actual evidence

41:09.572 --> 41:11.774
for this "relationship"

41:11.774 --> 41:14.043
between your daughter

41:14.043 --> 41:16.579
and Mr. Gallagher, do you?

41:19.849 --> 41:22.118
Yes, I do.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.589
And...

41:28.190 --> 41:30.960
...what would that be?

41:39.935 --> 41:41.671
There.

42:03.264 --> 42:05.299
Epic. I mean, holy shit.

42:05.299 --> 42:07.501
Come on. This is a page-turner.

42:07.501 --> 42:08.869
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:08.869 --> 42:10.338
I remember the one case.

42:10.338 --> 42:12.473
A restaurant, the son
beating the dad to death.

42:12.473 --> 42:13.808
Unbelievable.

42:13.808 --> 42:15.609
And the pill mill
across the hall?

42:15.609 --> 42:18.079
- Alex threatening the guy
in actual words?
- Yeah.

42:18.079 --> 42:19.947
That's what he's saying now.

42:19.947 --> 42:21.615
And how many cases,
historically, have we seen

42:21.615 --> 42:24.618
of people like him killing
people like her for less?

42:26.454 --> 42:28.656
I do have kind of a hard time
thinking of Gabriel Ibarra

42:28.656 --> 42:31.425
as a guy who'd solve
that problem that way, but...

42:31.425 --> 42:33.160
this is a trial application, right?

42:33.160 --> 42:34.829
You got to pull out
all the stops.

42:34.829 --> 42:37.698
But you can't expect me to be
that happy about it, though.

42:37.698 --> 42:40.768
I mean, I had you sewn up as one
of the greatest secret weapons

42:40.768 --> 42:42.770
any law firm could have.

42:42.770 --> 42:45.339
You working here was gonna
make me so look so good,

42:45.339 --> 42:47.375
I should have known
it couldn't last.

42:48.376 --> 42:50.444
Anyway...
Hey, I almost forgot

42:50.444 --> 42:52.413
the Ukrainian woman's husband
trying to beat Dan up,

42:52.413 --> 42:54.815
- thinking he was you.
- Yeah, yeah, and the best part

42:54.815 --> 42:56.684
about it is,
he violated his parole,

42:56.684 --> 42:59.687
so for the next five to ten,
we'll know where he is.

42:59.687 --> 43:01.756
Hey, do you put a full bakery
like this out every day,

43:01.756 --> 43:03.457
or just on Mondays?
You want to come do
some freelance

43:03.457 --> 43:05.126
investigating for us?
Hmm?

43:05.126 --> 43:07.128
Every day is muffin day here.

43:07.128 --> 43:09.597
And an omelet bar on Fridays.

43:09.597 --> 43:11.932
Shut your mouth.

43:13.267 --> 43:15.069
<i>when Marcella Leyva</i>

43:15.069 --> 43:17.071
was elected D.A., she asked me

43:17.071 --> 43:19.340
to come over
as chief investigator.

43:19.340 --> 43:24.145
Dan was already being promoted
as head of Major Crimes.

43:24.145 --> 43:25.880
And he said
he'd put in a word for me.

43:25.880 --> 43:28.849
And did
your professional relationship

43:28.849 --> 43:33.087
with Mr. Gallagher change
as a result of these promotions?

43:33.087 --> 43:35.089
Um, we made a good team.

43:35.089 --> 43:38.192
And it deepened our friendship.

43:38.192 --> 43:41.328
Can you tell us,
over your career,

43:41.328 --> 43:44.765
how many homicide investigations
have you conducted

43:44.765 --> 43:46.600
or supervised?

43:46.600 --> 43:50.337
- Uh, hundreds.
- And that vast experience

43:50.337 --> 43:52.440
must have helped you
develop a sense

43:52.440 --> 43:56.076
for whether someone is capable
of that crime.

43:56.877 --> 43:58.312
I believe it has, yes.

43:58.312 --> 44:00.714
So, putting aside
your friendship,

44:00.714 --> 44:04.018
can you give us
your professional opinion

44:04.018 --> 44:07.154
as to whether Dan Gallagher...

44:08.722 --> 44:10.825
...could commit

44:10.825 --> 44:13.160
murder?

44:14.962 --> 44:16.864
Never.

44:16.864 --> 44:18.966
He couldn't do it. It's just...

44:18.966 --> 44:20.935
It's not in the guy.

44:20.935 --> 44:23.037
<i>You said you were concerned</i>

44:23.037 --> 44:27.141
that the victim was
delusional and dangerous.

44:27.141 --> 44:29.743
Did you report those concerns

44:29.743 --> 44:31.412
to Human Resources?

44:31.412 --> 44:33.314
I didn't want
to escalate the situation...

44:33.314 --> 44:35.416
It's a "yes or no" question.

44:36.383 --> 44:37.852
No.

44:37.852 --> 44:39.787
Did you report the situation

44:39.787 --> 44:44.725
to the district attorney,
or to the victim's supervisor,

44:44.725 --> 44:46.427
- Ms. Lewis?
- No.

44:46.427 --> 44:48.128
Did you contact the LAPD

44:48.128 --> 44:50.130
to report this delusional

44:50.130 --> 44:52.500
and dangerous woman?

44:52.500 --> 44:54.034
No, I did not.

44:54.034 --> 44:56.270
Thank you, Detective.

45:07.581 --> 45:10.017
Detective,
is it true that you went

45:10.017 --> 45:11.752
to Ms. Forrest's
apartment building

45:11.752 --> 45:14.421
on the day of her murder?

45:15.256 --> 45:17.591
- I...
- Yes or no, please.

45:26.066 --> 45:27.601
Yes.

45:27.601 --> 45:29.937
That's all, Detective.
Thank you.

45:36.677 --> 45:38.946
<i>I got her address
from the employee roster,</i>

45:38.946 --> 45:41.115
and I went there
to speak with her.

45:41.115 --> 45:45.252
I thought maybe if we spoke
someplace that she felt safe,

45:45.252 --> 45:47.254
she would hear me
when I told her

45:47.254 --> 45:48.722
that I am a family man,

45:48.722 --> 45:51.892
that I would never
reciprocate her feelings.

45:51.892 --> 45:55.396
And I wanted to avoid
a public spectacle for her sake.

45:56.463 --> 45:59.934
In retrospect,
I know that was naive.

46:02.303 --> 46:04.638
I don't think I realized
how far gone she was.

46:06.941 --> 46:09.209
Until she kidnapped my daughter.

46:10.744 --> 46:13.213
So that's why
they recovered your fingerprints

46:13.213 --> 46:15.616
inside Alex's apartment?

46:16.784 --> 46:18.218
Yes, it is.

46:19.486 --> 46:22.256
Well, why did you tell
Detective Brooker

46:22.256 --> 46:24.558
you didn't know where she lived?

46:26.360 --> 46:28.629
Uh, he's mistaken.
I didn't say that.

46:34.835 --> 46:36.937
Dan...

46:36.937 --> 46:41.275
did you kill Alexandra Forrest?

46:42.910 --> 46:44.979
No, I did not.

46:48.015 --> 46:50.084
I have spent my entire life

46:50.084 --> 46:51.919
in the service of justice.

46:51.919 --> 46:55.456
It would go against
everything that I believe

46:55.456 --> 46:57.791
to take someone else's.

46:58.959 --> 47:01.395
No matter how afraid I was,
I just couldn't do that.

47:02.363 --> 47:04.365
Not to Alexandra Forrest,
not to anyone else.

47:04.365 --> 47:06.200
<i>Mr. Gallagher, when</i>

47:06.200 --> 47:09.336
you realized your daughter had
been kidnapped by Alex Forrest,

47:09.336 --> 47:11.972
did you call the police?

47:11.972 --> 47:14.274
- No.
- The FBI?

47:16.443 --> 47:18.445
I was preparing
to call the FBI.

47:18.445 --> 47:22.016
So, faced with every parent's
greatest nightmare,

47:22.016 --> 47:25.352
you had to prepare
to call the FBI.

47:25.352 --> 47:27.621
Did you ever call them?

47:30.357 --> 47:32.259
- No.
- Did you already

47:32.259 --> 47:35.696
know when you came up
with the kidnapping story

47:35.696 --> 47:38.932
that you were going
to murder her?

47:38.932 --> 47:40.868
<i>I wa-- I di-- No.</i>

47:40.868 --> 47:43.470
<i>You used her, and then
you tried to throw her away.</i>

47:43.470 --> 47:45.105
I didn't. I...

47:45.105 --> 47:46.840
<i>And when she wouldn't go,</i>

47:46.840 --> 47:49.309
you threatened her,
you physically assaulted her,

47:49.309 --> 47:50.577
<i>and you killed her.</i>

47:50.577 --> 47:52.079
<i>She's ready</i>

47:52.079 --> 47:54.448
to say good night.

47:59.620 --> 48:01.221
You should know
that you can say "no"

48:01.221 --> 48:03.657
to what I'm about to ask you.

48:05.259 --> 48:09.396
But you should also know that,
after how today went...

48:09.396 --> 48:11.932
...I'm probably gonna need you
to say "yes."

48:14.668 --> 48:18.272
Mm, she just said
she was a friend of my dad's,

48:18.272 --> 48:21.308
and that he needed me
to go with her.

48:21.308 --> 48:24.545
I asked her things,
and she knew it all--

48:24.545 --> 48:26.613
my dad's name,
my mom's name,

48:26.613 --> 48:30.884
their jobs,
and even my dog's name, so...

48:30.884 --> 48:35.055
Hmm, okay,
and where'd you two go?

48:36.390 --> 48:38.625
Just to a park,
and we walked around.

48:38.625 --> 48:40.394
Hmm.

48:40.394 --> 48:43.030
I'm going to show you a book.

48:43.030 --> 48:45.132
Okay?

48:48.202 --> 48:49.870
Do you recognize it?

48:49.870 --> 48:52.306
Yeah, it's mine.

48:52.306 --> 48:55.609
<i>The Story Of Layla
and Majnun.</i>

48:55.609 --> 48:57.845
This book was found
inside the apartment

48:57.845 --> 48:59.813
of the woman
you went to the park with.

48:59.813 --> 49:02.649
- Do you know how she got it?
- I gave it to her.

49:02.649 --> 49:04.651
Can I have it back, please?

49:04.651 --> 49:07.421
Of course.
As soon as the trial is over.

49:07.421 --> 49:09.590
Is this a picture of the woman

49:09.590 --> 49:11.825
who took you to the park?

49:11.825 --> 49:13.494
Yeah, that's her.

49:13.494 --> 49:15.195
For the record, the photo

49:15.195 --> 49:18.098
is of Alexandra Forrest.
Nothing further.

49:18.098 --> 49:20.067
Thank you.

49:21.668 --> 49:22.836
Ms. Ruiz?

49:22.836 --> 49:24.571
No questions, Your Honor.

49:24.571 --> 49:26.707
Okay, then. Thank you, Ellen.

49:26.707 --> 49:28.842
Thank you.

49:49.163 --> 49:51.198
All rise.

50:03.110 --> 50:06.113
I'll remind you all
we're here today because

50:06.113 --> 50:09.683
an innocent woman named
Alexandra Forrest was murdered,

50:09.683 --> 50:12.286
and because
a jury found Mr. Gallagher

50:12.286 --> 50:14.621
guilty of this terrible crime.

50:15.722 --> 50:17.724
I read your application.

50:17.724 --> 50:21.428
Not only was it well-written
and considered,

50:21.428 --> 50:24.531
it raises
very compelling questions.

50:24.531 --> 50:28.068
But the salient,
relevant argument to be made

50:28.068 --> 50:29.837
is that you are a liar.

50:29.837 --> 50:33.173
You lied
to the investigating detective,

50:33.173 --> 50:34.908
Earl Brooker.

50:34.908 --> 50:37.444
You lied under oath
at your trial.

50:37.444 --> 50:39.813
You lied
at your parole hearing.

50:39.813 --> 50:42.649
So I don't think
it's unfair to presume

50:42.649 --> 50:44.818
you've probably lied

50:44.818 --> 50:47.287
in this application
before the court.

50:47.287 --> 50:50.991
As a result, it's impossible
to know, as I sit here today,

50:50.991 --> 50:54.995
which version of your story
I'm supposed to believe.

50:54.995 --> 50:57.831
In this court,
the truth is important.

50:57.831 --> 51:00.634
And the truth
in this court today is

51:00.634 --> 51:04.238
that you have received
more than enough attention

51:04.238 --> 51:06.273
and indulgence

51:06.273 --> 51:08.709
on this case already.

51:08.709 --> 51:11.778
Simply stated,
the criminal justice system

51:11.778 --> 51:14.781
has given you all the justice
you deserve.

51:14.781 --> 51:17.517
So I'm not going
to give you any more.

51:17.517 --> 51:20.721
I'm denying your motion
for a new trial.

51:20.721 --> 51:23.557
Please give the defendant
written notice

51:23.557 --> 51:25.926
of his right to appeal.

51:33.567 --> 51:35.168
<i>As to the charge of murder,</i>

51:35.168 --> 51:38.372
how do you find the defendant,
Daniel Gallagher?

51:38.372 --> 51:40.674
Guilty.

52:18.245 --> 52:21.181
- ...have the time.
- The library, right?

52:21.181 --> 52:22.749
Okay.

52:22.749 --> 52:25.886
Oh, hey. Hi.
You have a Stella, uh, Chapman

52:25.886 --> 52:28.188
- in your Research Methods
section, right?
- Mm-hmm.

52:28.188 --> 52:30.557
Well, when's the last time
you talked to her?

52:30.557 --> 52:32.592
I... don't know.

52:32.592 --> 52:34.027
- Huh.
- How come?

52:34.027 --> 52:35.929
Well, I mean, she hasn't
showed up to work study

52:35.929 --> 52:37.464
since Tuesday,
and Dr. Ranum said

52:37.464 --> 52:39.099
he didn't see her
in morning seminar.

52:39.099 --> 52:40.701
And she's not answering
her texts,

52:40.701 --> 52:42.402
and her voice mailbox is full.

52:42.402 --> 52:44.404
Wow. I...

52:44.404 --> 52:47.007
- I-I wish I could help.
- Okay.

52:47.007 --> 52:49.142
Okay.

52:49.977 --> 52:52.245
Yeah, that'd be great.

52:53.814 --> 52:55.949
I kept finding reasons
not to go to the office

52:55.949 --> 52:57.751
till Arthur finally pointed out

52:57.751 --> 53:01.221
that I hadn't been there
in person in an actual year.

53:01.221 --> 53:04.524
So, we, uh...

53:04.524 --> 53:06.526
wiggled out of the lease

53:06.526 --> 53:09.730
and just started working
from here.

53:09.730 --> 53:11.732
I can see why.

53:11.732 --> 53:13.133
Yeah, it's crazy.

53:13.133 --> 53:15.235
Sometimes
I can't believe I live here.

53:24.578 --> 53:26.813
How are you doing?

53:30.550 --> 53:32.753
I had my hearing.

53:33.653 --> 53:36.656
I was able to stand
in front of a judge.

53:37.491 --> 53:40.427
And she denied my application.

53:40.427 --> 53:42.829
And what does that mean?

53:42.829 --> 53:45.432
I will not be getting
a new trial.

53:47.534 --> 53:49.770
But did she read
the application?

53:49.770 --> 53:52.005
There was so much
new information.

53:52.005 --> 53:55.075
Ellen and I...
How can they just...?

54:00.614 --> 54:02.883
I'm so sorry.

54:02.883 --> 54:05.152
I have wanted this for so long.

54:05.152 --> 54:07.587
Because even after
the way that I hurt you,

54:07.587 --> 54:09.856
you just always...

54:09.856 --> 54:12.692
believed in me.

54:13.727 --> 54:17.564
I wanted you to be able to know
that you'd been right to do it.

54:17.564 --> 54:22.135
Now, you will forever have
to just take that on faith.

54:28.675 --> 54:30.610
I don't need another trial

54:30.610 --> 54:33.180
to tell me what I already know.

54:36.950 --> 54:39.786
It's what my mom always said.

54:39.786 --> 54:42.823
Faith is knowing
without being shown.

54:54.067 --> 54:56.036
I need you to take Ellen.

54:56.036 --> 54:57.904
- Take her with you.
- Okay.

54:57.904 --> 55:00.907
- Where are you going?
- The house
on Satsuma's a shitshow.

55:00.907 --> 55:03.110
I've been leaving Arthur
to deal with all of it.

55:03.110 --> 55:05.245
I'll be back.
Just distract her.

55:05.245 --> 55:09.015
Don't say anything
about us to her, please.

55:10.350 --> 55:12.419
Of course. I wouldn't.

55:18.758 --> 55:20.760
The special.

55:24.731 --> 55:27.234
I'll have the same.

55:37.611 --> 55:39.412
Thank you for coming.

55:39.412 --> 55:41.148
Why wouldn't I?

55:41.148 --> 55:44.184
How else was I going
to find out what you want?
