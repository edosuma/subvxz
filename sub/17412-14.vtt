00:02.001 --> 00:03.402
All right, you may be wondering

00:03.404 --> 00:07.673
     Budgetary constraints.

00:07.675 --> 00:10.342
 I've decided it's time for me
  to take it to the next level

00:10.344 --> 00:11.477
         With my loml.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.112
        - Your what now?
            - Loml.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.680
         It stands for
       "love of my life."

00:14.682 --> 00:16.548
     I'm trying to make it
     the next big acronym.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.217
        That's gonna be
       an uphill battle.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.452
  Darling, what do you mean by
         "next level"?

00:20.454 --> 00:22.488
       I want to ask shea
      to be my girlfriend.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.455
Oh, n-na--

00:23.457 --> 00:25.024
Wha-ha-ha-ha-ha,
ho-ho-ho...

00:25.026 --> 00:26.358
Hold on. Hold on.
I don't know--

00:26.360 --> 00:30.262
    I don't know if we could
    be any happier for you.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.363
           - Really?
           - Really.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.631
           - Really?
            - Yeah.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.366
         - Go get her.
         - Go get her.

00:34.368 --> 00:37.069
       Thanks, you guys.
  I'm gonna go work on my ask.

00:38.571 --> 00:41.373
What was--what--
what was that? Huh?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.809
Because shea is not
who I intend

00:43.811 --> 00:45.411
To be my someday
daughter-in-law.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.079
            - What?
  - Yeah. No, it could happen.

00:47.081 --> 00:50.382
Then marcus is struggling
to pay child support

00:50.384 --> 00:51.617
For their unplanned twins.

00:51.619 --> 00:52.684
Job market's crap,

00:52.686 --> 00:54.053
And the next thing
you know,

00:54.055 --> 00:57.056
He's had to take a job
modeling to pay the bills.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.557
                    He--he does?

00:58.559 --> 00:59.591
      First it's catalog.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.527
         But the runway
     always comes calling.

01:01.529 --> 01:04.495
                 Shea and marcus
        are never going to date.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.398
                 Shea will never
                 say yes to him.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.800
      How do you know that
           for sure?

01:07.802 --> 01:10.302
            (marcus)
      give me an s-h-e...

01:10.304 --> 01:12.137
         Give me an a.
     What does that spell?

01:12.139 --> 01:13.172
            [groans]

01:13.174 --> 01:14.540
            - Shea!
            - Yeah.

01:14.542 --> 01:17.242
       His irrepressible
         <i> joie de vivre</i>

01:17.244 --> 01:19.278
Will be wasted
on the likes of shea.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.347
           Yup, so why forbid it
          and become the bad guy

01:22.349 --> 01:23.482
                  For no reason?

01:23.484 --> 01:24.850
                 I am brilliant.
                 You're welcome.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.419
So what, we just let him go out
there and get his heart broken?

01:27.421 --> 01:28.854
              Look, I don't want
                 the little dude

01:28.856 --> 01:30.289
                Hurting any more
                    than you do.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.558
             You know, but being
              rejected by a girl

01:32.560 --> 01:34.693
                 Is kind of like
         a male rite of passage.

01:34.695 --> 01:37.096
           Like, it's like going
           from briefs to boxers

01:37.098 --> 01:39.531
                       Or boxers
                to boxer-briefs.

01:39.533 --> 01:40.766
Yeah, but he still
wears the ones

01:40.768 --> 01:42.468
With the spider-man
on his bottom.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.470
                Trust me on this
                      one, okay?

01:44.472 --> 01:45.804
                It's not our job
                   to intervene.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.372
              It's our job to be
            there to comfort him

01:47.374 --> 01:48.540
                  And to pick up
                     the pieces.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.109
Okay.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.777
I suppose you're right.

01:51.779 --> 01:52.878
I hate saying that.

01:55.181 --> 01:56.582

          here we go.

02:28.682 --> 02:29.715
            - Hello.
             - Hey.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.683
How are you?

02:31.685 --> 02:33.318
Oh, wait.
Did we have plans?

02:33.320 --> 02:35.154
I'm so confused
since I switched

02:35.156 --> 02:37.222
From the jewish calendar
to the lunar calendar.

02:37.224 --> 02:38.390
         No, no, no, no, no, no.
           We didn't have plans.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.392
               Tonight is a huge
                  meteor shower,

02:40.394 --> 02:41.827
                    And I figure
                if we leave now,

02:41.829 --> 02:43.595
          We have time to get up
      to my friend's observatory

02:43.597 --> 02:44.730

02:45.933 --> 02:47.566
                    We are going
          on an adventure, baby.

Oh, that sounds
incredible...

02:50.671 --> 02:52.371
     Baby.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.873
But you know, I've got
to stay with marcus tonight.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.375
                 Yes, of course.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.709
               Ah, I'm so sorry.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.178

              in the excitement.

      I mean, you know how I get
                  about meteors.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.648
I know, well, you go
and enjoy the shower,

03:02.650 --> 03:04.516
And then we're still on
for tomorrow, right?

03:04.518 --> 03:05.584
                 Yes, of course.

                      like that.

                     No, no, no.

gonna make pesto.

I'm gonna infuse
the pine nuts

03:20.768 --> 03:23.302

Pink pesto.

      - How wild is that?

03:28.375 --> 03:29.541
     - That's pretty wild.
            - Right?

03:29.543 --> 03:30.842
        - I can't wait.
            - Okay.

          Oh, cabbage.

We've experienced

                   Texts are up.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.627
        And last month,
         one butt dial.

03:52.298 --> 03:57.669
             Basically, what I'm
          trying to say here is:

03:57.671 --> 03:59.871
                     Will you be
                  my girlfriend?

03:59.873 --> 04:01.306
  Why?

04:01.308 --> 04:02.307
                     I like you.

04:02.309 --> 04:03.475
Have you ever had
a girlfriend?

04:03.477 --> 04:04.610
             - No.
- Then why do you want one now?

04:04.612 --> 04:05.978
         - I like you.
      - What's the catch?

04:05.980 --> 04:08.480
                           I am.
                        [laughs]

04:08.482 --> 04:10.315
             It's a little joke.

04:10.317 --> 04:11.883
                   Uh, no catch.

04:15.989 --> 04:19.458
Grieving but healing.

04:19.459 --> 04:20.659
      What is that smell?

04:20.661 --> 04:23.395
 Why are you spraying lingerie
        with sour juice?

04:23.397 --> 04:25.297
            It's not sour juice.
           It's patchouli water.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.633
                  I am preparing
                 a grieving robe

04:27.635 --> 04:30.035
         For marcus to deal with
               shea's rejection.

04:31.504 --> 04:33.872
Are you comforting marcus
or a middle-aged lesbian?

04:33.874 --> 04:35.641
I am gonna help marcus
get over shea

04:35.643 --> 04:38.844

and some dead animals.

04:39.847 --> 04:40.846

actually.

Hey, guys.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.019
         - Hi, darling.

Wait.
And you made me ribs.

to celebrate.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.062

                          Buddy.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.331
       Those are completely raw.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.700

from salmonella.

from shutting down

05:22.022 --> 05:23.922

the grand love story

05:23.924 --> 05:25.324
Of marcus's life.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.459
                          I did?

05:27.461 --> 05:29.895
                     Yeah, yeah.
                    Yeah, I did.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.830
                       You know,
            the thing is, fiona,

05:31.832 --> 05:34.933
            I always had a hunch
                about that shea.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.002
It's quite ironic

05:37.004 --> 05:41.373
That marcus's love flower
blossoms while mine wilts

05:41.375 --> 05:44.042
Or, rather, dries up
from boredom.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.477
               Okay, number one:

05:45.479 --> 05:47.813
          Never, ever talk about
                your love flower

05:47.815 --> 05:49.748
                      Drying up,
                 and number two:

05:49.750 --> 05:50.916
                   What's wrong?

05:50.918 --> 05:53.719
        Is there trouble brewing
        in swarthy teacher land?

05:53.721 --> 05:56.788
Chris always wants to go on
these spontaneous adventures.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.057
"let's go surfing
right now," he says.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.859
But I'm a mom.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.694
I need notice.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.463
I really want to plan

06:04.465 --> 06:05.997
An adventurous date.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.966
            Well, you can't plan
         an adventure, you know.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.569
             That undermines its
        inherent adventure-ness.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.870
What should I do?

06:11.872 --> 06:13.138
                   I don't know.
             You know, anything.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.374
            You could be sitting
                 down for dinner

06:15.376 --> 06:17.576
    And you'd be like, "you know
          what would be awesome?

06:17.578 --> 06:18.744
              Some truffle oil."

06:18.746 --> 06:20.445
               And then you guys
                    just get up.

06:20.447 --> 06:22.748
                 You just forage
                   for truffles.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.982
                     Okay, well,
          it'd be awesome--what?

06:23.984 --> 06:24.983
                    What was the
                 last bit there?

06:24.985 --> 06:26.752
Wha--truffle oil,
but that--

06:26.754 --> 06:28.520
That was just
an example, fiona.

06:28.522 --> 06:31.123
              A perfect example.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.791
            Hold on to your hat,
                          chris.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.127
     We're going truffle hunting

06:35.129 --> 06:37.162
                            On a
                [whispers] whim.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.401

                 in ten minutes,

07:38.058 --> 07:40.859
            I got to get started
             on shea's homework.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.594
You shouldn't be doing
errands for shea.

07:42.596 --> 07:43.895
That's not
what a boyfriend does.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.564
          - It's not?
             - No.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.472
                         How?

07:53.474 --> 07:54.906
By taking her on a date

07:54.908 --> 07:58.210
And making her see you
as a man, all right?

08:06.587 --> 08:07.953
      Laurie's eyeglasses

08:07.955 --> 08:10.755
  And then get her skirt suits
     from the dry cleaner.

08:10.757 --> 08:12.891
What?

08:12.893 --> 08:15.060
Why are you guys looking
at me like that?

          I'm turning into andy.

  You still got a lot of time.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.165

08:26.573 --> 08:27.639
    All right, what are you
           gonna do?

08:27.641 --> 08:28.740
      You do a little text
            action?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.303

                 shooting stars.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.871

              and in the moment.

                   one of those?

09:05.711 --> 09:08.246
Oh, no.
This pasta is terribly bland.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.548
                     No, I think
                 it's delicious.

09:09.550 --> 09:10.916
I wonder what it needs.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.050
                  Maybe a little
                   black pepper.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.092

blow out the candles

to the date plan

she says.

Always hold the door.
Never hold her purse.

             here, off the grid.

          it has been

11:16.710 --> 11:17.909
      A lovely adventure,
           hasn't it?

11:17.911 --> 11:20.679
But should we head back
and truffle up our dinner?

11:20.681 --> 11:22.347
                 We could, or...

11:22.349 --> 11:24.182
              I know a fantastic
                      hot spring

11:24.184 --> 11:25.316
                About 15 minutes
                    up the road.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.418
                  We could hike.

11:26.420 --> 11:29.320
Oh, well, we don't
have our bathing suits.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.722
       Neither did adam and eve.

         strictly true,

fig leaf two piece.

                  Just trust me.

11:38.731 --> 11:40.932
All right, so you got
your classic flavors:

11:40.934 --> 11:43.902
You got chocolate,
vanilla, peanut butter,

11:43.904 --> 11:45.937
But if you're feeling
a little adventurous,

11:45.939 --> 11:47.939
You could take a walk on
the peppermint mocha side.

                 samples, pasty.

11:49.443 --> 11:50.475

11:54.347 --> 11:55.947
         - What's that?
         - Chaperoning?

11:55.949 --> 11:58.183
    We do the whole "be cool
     and hang back" thing.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.085
      - Which one's yours?
         - Uh, marcus.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.920
           Oh, marcus is the one
         that's dating shea now.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.088
         - Oh, my gosh.
       - It's very weird.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.222
It's a very weird
relationship.

          That dark little storm
       cloud behind the counter.

12:13.867 --> 12:18.937
      I'm saying that shea
        is using marcus

12:18.939 --> 12:19.938
      To make viper jelly.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.940
        And jelly means jealous?

12:21.942 --> 12:23.208
             Obvi.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.275

       Man, I got to work
       on my facial hair.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.622
I think shea might be using you
     to make viper jealous.

14:50.624 --> 14:51.589
            No way.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.124
   Shea would never do that.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.626
     Well, then why did she
        bring you here?

   how she's ugly and stupid

15:28.528 --> 15:32.063
 And worthless, I think my name
    for her is much better.

didn't talk about her that way.

                  Well, that's--
                    that's okay.

it's okay for me.

at a moment's notice

16:32.092 --> 16:35.727
And go see a meteor shower
or go surfing

16:35.729 --> 16:37.662
Or skinny dipping.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.998

for you not to sue?

                       like you,

I'd be your girlfriend,

I liked having you around

18:03.550 --> 18:04.816

make viper jealous.

hard to believe

18:15.562 --> 18:16.561
That you were
for real,

18:16.563 --> 18:17.695

guys date me

Because they've heard
rumors about me

my mom's never home

have beer in our fridge.

that nice stuff about me...

you're for real.

           Here I am!
         How did it go?

19:00.140 --> 19:01.405
                     Sorry I was
                   off the grid.

19:01.407 --> 19:02.406
             Tell me everything.

19:02.408 --> 19:05.143
So shea was only
using me

19:05.145 --> 19:06.277
To make her
ex jealous.

19:06.279 --> 19:07.411
                           What?

19:07.413 --> 19:09.147
                           Will!

19:09.149 --> 19:10.548
But then I
stood up to viper.

19:10.550 --> 19:13.484
            Wait--shea has an ex
                 called "viper"?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.419
And then shea realized
she wanted to be

19:15.421 --> 19:17.588
My girlfriend for real,
and I got kissed.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.690
                    Oh, darling,
                 you got kissed!

19:19.692 --> 19:22.360
It was pretty much the
best night of my life.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.395
                 Marcus, that is
                   so wonderful.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.631
And next time,
he's gonna kiss back.

19:28.233 --> 19:29.567
                Darling, listen,
                 you go upstairs

19:29.569 --> 19:30.768
          And get ready for bed.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.503
           I'm gonna come up and
           hear all the details.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.305
           All right.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.274
         Wait until you
      hear about the part

19:36.276 --> 19:37.575
      Where I got punched
        in the stomach.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.610
                You got punched?

19:40.812 --> 19:42.313
               But that could've
                 been the worst.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.582
          You know he has a very
               sensitive stomach

19:44.584 --> 19:46.551
                  Because of the
               lactose allergies

19:46.553 --> 19:48.419
          And his hypersensitive
              navel, you can't--

19:48.421 --> 19:50.688
        What is going on
     with your fingertips?

19:50.690 --> 19:52.190
        Why do you have
          ink on them?

19:52.192 --> 19:54.959
      That's--that is just
     some rubber stamp work

19:54.961 --> 19:56.427
      From holiday cards.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.695
   Christmas was months ago.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.397
     What's going on here,
             fiona?

19:59.399 --> 20:01.866
      It's fingerprint ink
    from down the precinct,

20:01.868 --> 20:04.202
     Where we got arrested
      for skinny dipping.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.703
          Ho-ho-ho-ho!

20:05.705 --> 20:08.739
       Adventurous fiona
        skinny dipping!

20:08.741 --> 20:12.310
      Looks like someone's
 dried-up love flower got wet!

20:12.312 --> 20:14.979
       Listen, I'm gonna
        make you a deal.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.949
  You're gonna take my skinny
  dipping arrest to the grave,

20:17.951 --> 20:19.684
    And I'm gonna spare you
          the lecture

20:19.686 --> 20:21.219
  On what a rubbish chaperone
            you are.

20:22.854 --> 20:23.854
           All right.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.223
 Although, your skinny dipping

20:25.225 --> 20:26.824
       Definitely trumps
        my chaperoning.

20:26.826 --> 20:27.825
                          Right.

20:27.827 --> 20:28.926
                Now you're gonna
                  get a lecture.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.661
                   One: You're a
              rubbish chaperone.

20:30.663 --> 20:33.531
        Two: You are a very poor
             judge of character.

20:33.533 --> 20:36.434
               Three: You're far
            too tall, sasquatch.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.835
          Four: You're an idiot.

20:37.837 --> 20:41.239
          Five: Snip, snip, snip
         on your eyebrows, okay?

20:41.241 --> 20:45.309
       Six: Your hair's too big,
      and it's not the humidity.
