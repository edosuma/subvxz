01:01.411 --> 01:03.712
( exhales )

01:05.498 --> 01:07.666
I thought you were
going to open it up.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.301
I got a hell
of a shaker on 130.

01:09.336 --> 01:10.802
What are you afraid of?

01:10.838 --> 01:12.337
That was fast.

01:12.339 --> 01:14.005
Apparently not.

01:14.007 --> 01:16.341
So, what do you think?

01:16.343 --> 01:17.676
Can we go to El Mirage?

01:17.678 --> 01:19.177
You and your record books.

01:19.229 --> 01:21.680
You got to take care
of that shimmy.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.849
You won't lose control,
but I bet it creates drag.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.517
You know an awful lot
about cars

01:25.519 --> 01:27.018
for a guy who hasn't got one.

01:28.355 --> 01:29.855
We just need a stake.

01:29.857 --> 01:32.023
A couple hundred bucks
for a flatbed rig,

01:32.025 --> 01:33.191
some parts.

01:33.243 --> 01:35.360
And beer and gas.

01:46.223 --> 01:48.807
Drive from O'Hare
Airport to breakfast

01:48.809 --> 01:51.359
with Sears Roebuck
senior vice presidents.

01:51.395 --> 01:55.146
Then the Chicago Ad Club.

01:55.148 --> 01:57.482
12:30 luncheon,
1:30 speech.

01:57.484 --> 02:00.201
I translated your speech
into Pig Latin.

02:00.237 --> 02:03.405
That was a joke.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.573
And?

02:05.625 --> 02:08.910
And I've arranged
for that package

02:08.961 --> 02:11.663
to be delivered to your suite
at the Stanhope tomorrow.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.164
What package?

02:13.166 --> 02:17.552
The package from Canada
with all the luggage?

02:17.587 --> 02:19.504
She knows about Marie.

02:19.506 --> 02:23.091
She's Megan's mother.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.926
I'm going to leave
you two alone.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.479
- Do I have to?
- Yes.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.070
Sweetheart,
I have some sad news.

02:35.105 --> 02:36.738
Is he dead?

02:36.773 --> 02:39.941
Don? No.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.527
I don't think so. I think we
would have heard about that.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.245
Oh.

02:44.281 --> 02:48.450
That said, our secret plan
here has been discovered.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.285
They know I don't need
two secretaries.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.453
I'm sorry.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.254
I really thought
he'd be back by now.

02:53.290 --> 02:55.707
Well, I hope he's in
a better place.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.876
He's not dead.
Stop saying that.

02:57.878 --> 03:00.879
There are a lot of
better places than here.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.886
I'll give you the
recommendation he would have.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.637
I know you'll land
on your feet.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.773
I always do.

03:15.228 --> 03:18.396
So that covers Del Monte,
Roman Meal,

03:18.448 --> 03:21.566
and Diamond Walnuts.
Bon appetit.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.486
That is all the accounts,
all assigned.

03:24.538 --> 03:28.540
And don't ask me again about
SO Research and Engineering.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.492
It's over.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.913
Why did they take us
off Chevalier?

03:34.965 --> 03:37.248
Did Ted say anything
to you about it?

03:37.300 --> 03:38.583
Ted's not
the creative director.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.252
They moved it to David's group.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.388
Does David know
they took us off?

03:43.423 --> 03:46.558
There's plenty to go around.

03:46.593 --> 03:48.593
It's over. It's done.
You have four good accounts.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.844
Now get to work.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.063
Lorraine, do you have a moment?

03:52.099 --> 03:54.432
Not really.

03:54.434 --> 03:56.935
Why are we off Chevalier?

03:56.987 --> 04:00.271
Because Stu Riley took over from Pete
Campbell and he has his favorites.

04:00.273 --> 04:02.740
I thought David
wanted us on it.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.275
I guess he didn't.

04:04.277 --> 04:05.994
Well, does he know?

04:06.029 --> 04:08.913
I don't know.
Why don't I call David

04:08.949 --> 04:10.782
and let him know
you're unhappy?

04:12.619 --> 04:14.035
You know what, Lorraine?

04:15.622 --> 04:17.255
Call David.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.757
In fact, why don't we go
over and see him right now?

04:19.793 --> 04:21.959
I'm sure he'd love
to get involved.

04:24.297 --> 04:25.930
Fine.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.465
You want it, you can have it.

04:29.302 --> 04:30.802
Thanks so much.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.117
You hung up my jeans.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.486
I like having a man
to take care of.

04:50.657 --> 04:52.824
My wallet didn't happen
to fall out, did it?

04:53.994 --> 04:55.827
What the hell does that mean?

04:55.829 --> 04:58.079
Should I go look?

05:00.667 --> 05:03.218
Maybe I wanted to know
who you were.

05:03.253 --> 05:04.886
Everybody thinks
you're from Detroit,

05:04.921 --> 05:07.222
come to steal their secrets.

05:07.257 --> 05:09.174
Did you leave me anything?

05:09.176 --> 05:11.559
( sighs )

05:11.595 --> 05:13.428
You've never paid for it, huh?

05:17.601 --> 05:20.902
I have and I will.

05:20.937 --> 05:22.854
I just like it to be voluntary.

05:24.774 --> 05:26.524
Get your purse.

05:41.625 --> 05:43.007
Could have asked me.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.126
That's never worked.

05:48.798 --> 05:50.298
Whose ring is that?

05:50.350 --> 05:51.933
( chuckles )

05:51.968 --> 05:53.301
Weren't you gonna steal it?

05:53.353 --> 05:56.104
( laughs )

05:56.139 --> 05:57.639
Thank you.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.232
We're leaving tomorrow.

06:07.234 --> 06:10.401
You know we're going to
beat those postcards home.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.570
I want them to say Key West.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.578
Who gave you cocaine
as a birthday present?

06:20.580 --> 06:23.915
My old partner.
It's all over Malibu.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.386
We said we'd try everything.

06:29.756 --> 06:32.307
Okay.

06:32.342 --> 06:34.926
I think you're supposed

06:34.928 --> 06:36.761
to sniff it off
your fingernail.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.938
( snorts )
Mmm.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.273
Okay, my turn.

06:52.779 --> 06:54.996
( snorts )

06:58.618 --> 07:00.418
( snorts )

07:00.453 --> 07:02.370
( coughs )

07:02.422 --> 07:06.040
Ooh. That's fast.

07:06.092 --> 07:09.377
I feel like someone just
gave me some very good news.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.549
You know, we could live
like this all the time.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.551
You just enjoy corrupting me.

07:16.603 --> 07:20.388
Not the cocaine. I'm talking about
taking advantage of all I have.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.724
All you have.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.642
You should be spoiled.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.394
I couldn't be more spoiled.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.229
The way I've been
living in New York,

07:28.281 --> 07:30.198
it's hard to tell
when the vacation started.

07:30.233 --> 07:31.899
Kevin's going to school soon,

07:31.951 --> 07:33.534
so I know you have
to be in one place.

07:33.570 --> 07:34.902
But if you think about it,

07:34.954 --> 07:37.238
why does that place
have to be New York?

07:37.290 --> 07:39.741
There are good schools everywhere
and you hate your mother.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.125
I don't hate her.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.244
Is that all you heard?
You're cheating yourself.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.913
That tiny apartment.
I don't want to make plans,

07:45.965 --> 07:48.249
but we could get a place in
the mountains or the country,

07:48.301 --> 07:49.667
or a place in the mountains
and the country.

07:49.669 --> 07:51.002
Have you been looking
for a place?

07:51.004 --> 07:52.420
It's a hobby.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.005
I mean, I guess
what I'm trying to say

07:54.007 --> 07:57.675
is I want you to let yourself
have a future with me.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.144
Do you want to get married?

08:00.180 --> 08:02.847
Sure. If you do.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.350
But it seems to me your life
is undeveloped property.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.018
You can turn it
into anything you want.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.187
It's got a hell of a view.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.656
Do we have to get married?

08:11.691 --> 08:13.074
Hell, no.

08:13.109 --> 08:16.828
I want you so much right now.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.366
I'm sorry.
I got held up.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.368
No, I'm sorry.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.869
Samsonite is shooting tomorrow,

08:24.921 --> 08:27.205
and they changed everything.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.706
I feel horrible,

08:28.708 --> 08:30.375
but I'm afraid it's just
you and Harry for lunch.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.710
That's my going away present?

08:32.761 --> 08:34.095
What else did you get?

08:34.130 --> 08:36.381
The account girls
got a little sentimental.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.049
Sarah baked cookies.

08:38.101 --> 08:41.018
And this is a cactus.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.886
What's that have
to do with Kansas?

08:42.889 --> 08:44.272
I don't know.

08:44.307 --> 08:45.827
Do you want it?
I have a five-year-old.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.394
Let's go.
I'm starving.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.396
She's not coming.
She has work to do.

08:51.448 --> 08:52.897
Don't do that.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.282
You know who I was supposed
to have lunch with?

08:54.317 --> 08:55.700
Someone important?

08:55.735 --> 08:58.069
Doesn't anything
mean anything to you?

08:58.121 --> 08:59.237
Here, this will hold you over.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.072
I'll meet you by the elevator.

09:04.744 --> 09:07.712
He acts like we're the Three Musketeers.
We've never had lunch.

09:07.747 --> 09:10.214
( laughs )

09:10.250 --> 09:14.385
I just wanted to say
that I'm very happy for you.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.887
And everyone's
going to miss you

09:15.922 --> 09:18.673
who doesn't hate you
for getting that big job.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.058
Well, you're doing fine.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.761
Keep it up, you'll be
a creative director by 1980.

09:23.763 --> 09:26.764
God, that sounds
like a long time.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.566
I'm telling you,
it will happen.

09:28.601 --> 09:30.067
They just have to
get used to the idea.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.736
Someday people
are going to brag

09:31.771 --> 09:33.271
that they worked with you.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.159
What am I supposed
to say to that?

09:38.194 --> 09:41.112
I don't know. No one's
ever said it to me.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.082
A thing like that.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.420
I'll be back.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.289
That thing better be alive.

09:58.731 --> 10:00.398
So you're in Utah?

10:00.450 --> 10:02.366
I sent you a clipping.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.702
They broke the land speed
record right up in Bonneville.

10:04.737 --> 10:07.238
Uh-huh.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.741
622 miles an hour in a car
that looked like a jet.

10:12.912 --> 10:13.961
Sally?

10:13.997 --> 10:16.747
I'm glad you're having fun.

10:16.749 --> 10:18.966
Sorry, I already
went to high school.

10:19.002 --> 10:21.085
I got to go.

10:21.087 --> 10:23.721
Hold on.
What's wrong?

10:23.756 --> 10:26.557
It's nothing.

10:26.593 --> 10:27.925
Boy problems?

10:27.927 --> 10:30.728
( <i>"Benshaw Glenn" playing</i> )

10:30.763 --> 10:32.563
I'm not supposed to tell you.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.265
What?

10:36.936 --> 10:38.686
Mom's dying.

10:38.738 --> 10:42.073
Look, your mother's
a hypochondriac.

10:42.108 --> 10:43.441
Don't go off the deep end.

10:43.493 --> 10:46.911
Dad, listen to me.
She has lung cancer.

10:46.946 --> 10:49.447
The doctors gave her
six months to live.

10:53.620 --> 10:54.919
What?

10:54.954 --> 10:56.921
She doesn't want you to know,

10:56.956 --> 10:59.123
but I just thought...

10:59.125 --> 11:02.293
No, you did the right thing.
I'm coming home.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.011
No, I'm telling you

11:04.047 --> 11:06.931
because she wants Gene and Bobby
to live with Uncle William.

11:06.966 --> 11:09.183
Don't worry. You're all going
to live with me. I promise.

11:09.218 --> 11:12.386
Let me finish. I've thought
about this more than you have.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.689
<i>You have to tell her</i>

11:14.724 --> 11:17.441
<i>that you think it's best</i>
<i>that they stay with Henry.</i>

11:17.477 --> 11:18.893
No.

11:18.945 --> 11:22.029
Daddy, it's going to be
so hard for them already.

11:22.065 --> 11:23.864
They should at least
be in the same bed

11:23.900 --> 11:25.282
and at the same school.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.201
Sally, grown-ups
make these decisions.

11:27.236 --> 11:30.488
Do you understand I'm
betraying her confidence?

11:31.908 --> 11:33.374
I'm not being dramatic.

11:33.409 --> 11:36.043
Now, please, take me seriously.

11:39.882 --> 11:41.832
- I have to go.
- Hold on.

11:41.884 --> 11:43.417
Please, I can't talk right now.

11:43.469 --> 11:45.753
- Sally, wait a minute.

- Don't you want the boys?
- Don: <i> No.</i>

12:21.708 --> 12:24.291
You know I talked
to Sally, don't you?

12:26.546 --> 12:27.878
Yes, of course.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.380
I'm coming home.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.215
You are definitely not!

12:31.217 --> 12:34.635
I want to be there.
The kids need me.

12:34.687 --> 12:37.388
I don't want to upset them.

12:37.390 --> 12:40.057
It's my business.

12:40.059 --> 12:42.393
I didn't even want her to know.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.562
But no one can keep
their mouth shut.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.280
I don't want you
to worry about them.

12:46.315 --> 12:48.115
They're going to come
live with me.

12:48.151 --> 12:49.400
You don't even have to ask.

12:49.452 --> 12:51.285
I wasn't going to.

12:53.239 --> 12:56.741
Please don't let your pride
interfere with my wishes.

12:56.793 --> 12:58.709
I'm their father.

13:00.246 --> 13:04.165
What they really need
is a woman in their life.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.333
A regular family.

13:06.385 --> 13:09.170
Living with my brother and Judy
is in their best interests.

13:09.222 --> 13:12.089
You don't have
the right to decide.

13:12.091 --> 13:15.676
What am I supposed to do?

13:15.728 --> 13:18.679
This way you see them exactly
as much as you do now,

13:18.731 --> 13:21.515
on weekends and--

13:21.567 --> 13:24.435
Oh, wait, Don.
When was the last time you saw them?

13:30.743 --> 13:33.110
Betty, I didn't know.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.700
Don, honey,
I-- I appreciate your intentions.

13:39.752 --> 13:43.037
I really do.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.872
But I'm not going to waste

13:44.924 --> 13:49.043
the rest of my time
arguing about this.

13:49.095 --> 13:52.546
I want to keep things
as normal as possible,

13:52.598 --> 13:55.432
and you not being here
is part of that.

14:01.858 --> 14:03.524
Birdie...

14:13.202 --> 14:15.319
I know.

14:15.371 --> 14:17.705
( sniffles )

14:25.047 --> 14:26.997
I have to go.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.085
( sighs )

14:31.137 --> 14:32.670
I'll talk to you soon.

14:35.057 --> 14:36.724
Okay.

14:44.233 --> 14:46.684
<i>( truck horn blaring )</i>

14:51.691 --> 14:53.858
( chuckles )
Mwah!

14:53.910 --> 14:55.910
Let me get you a glass.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.363
How was Florida?

14:59.415 --> 15:01.582
Compelling.

15:01.617 --> 15:04.869
I assume you held on to your
Rolodex when you retired?

15:04.921 --> 15:07.204
Can I taste the wine first?

15:10.626 --> 15:12.209
You know, you look great.

15:12.261 --> 15:15.179
( laughs )

15:15.214 --> 15:17.348
Thank you.

15:17.383 --> 15:19.016
What do you want?

15:19.051 --> 15:22.019
Every department at Dow has
to make an industrial film

15:22.054 --> 15:23.520
for the national sales meeting,

15:23.556 --> 15:25.856
and our script just came in.

15:25.892 --> 15:28.275
I fell asleep on
page two of 30.

15:28.311 --> 15:29.727
How long is this film?

15:29.729 --> 15:31.362
See? You know that.

15:31.397 --> 15:33.397
The producer is
as drunk as a skunk.

15:33.449 --> 15:35.399
I have to replace him.

15:35.451 --> 15:37.868
Do you remember the name of the
guy who produced Birds Eye?

15:37.904 --> 15:39.620
I'm sure I have
his number somewhere.

15:39.655 --> 15:42.823
It's $50,000 for eight minutes.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.042
A good producer
could pocket half of it,

15:45.077 --> 15:47.127
but he has to know
writers and directors.

15:47.163 --> 15:50.047
And I need it yesterday.
Joan, I can't be eclipsed

15:50.082 --> 15:51.999
by plastics
and packaging again.

15:52.051 --> 15:54.585
Relax, Kenny.
For that kind of money,

15:54.587 --> 15:56.553
there'll be 10 men for the job.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.506
Great.
So how's the family?

16:02.011 --> 16:04.762
Wonderful.
How's Eddie?

16:04.814 --> 16:06.146
He's a little weird, actually.

16:06.182 --> 16:07.681
I think there might be
something wrong with him.

16:07.733 --> 16:10.150
( laughs )

16:10.186 --> 16:11.852
( knocks on door )

16:13.689 --> 16:15.689
Come in.

16:20.696 --> 16:22.780
We can't ask him
for money like this.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.249
( groans )

16:25.284 --> 16:27.835
Don, you don't have
to come along,

16:27.870 --> 16:29.670
but you promised to stake us.

16:29.705 --> 16:32.006
( groans )

16:32.041 --> 16:33.424
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

16:35.711 --> 16:37.544
Should we pack you?

16:41.217 --> 16:43.017
I'm packed.

16:43.052 --> 16:45.719
- You can drop me in LA.
- Whoa!

16:57.298 --> 16:58.797
( TV playing )

16:58.799 --> 17:00.883
Hello, bigshot.

17:00.935 --> 17:03.602
I was hoping we could grab
lunch or a drink and catch up.

17:03.637 --> 17:05.971
It's so good to hear from you.

17:05.973 --> 17:08.807
I thought you forgot about me.

17:08.809 --> 17:11.059
How about...
the end of next week?

17:11.111 --> 17:13.896
I can't wait.
Is your weekend busy?

17:15.482 --> 17:17.281
You really want to catch up?

17:17.318 --> 17:19.534
Well, I ran
into Ken, and--

17:19.569 --> 17:21.486
Oh, how is he?

17:21.488 --> 17:23.655
Did you tell him I said hi?

17:23.656 --> 17:24.990
Why would you do that?

17:25.041 --> 17:27.826
Dow needs a script yesterday

17:27.828 --> 17:29.494
for an industrial film.

17:29.496 --> 17:30.996
You know the account,

17:30.998 --> 17:33.415
and, well,
we both thought of you.

17:33.467 --> 17:35.467
I don't have time to moonlight.

17:35.502 --> 17:38.387
It's $1,200
for a 10-page script.

17:38.422 --> 17:40.505
Jeez.

17:40.507 --> 17:42.391
Well, anything for a friend.

17:42.426 --> 17:46.011
We can chat when
I drop off the research.

17:46.013 --> 17:47.846
Obviously, not there.

17:47.848 --> 17:49.681
Of course.

17:54.021 --> 17:56.571
<i>( airplane passing )</i>

17:58.359 --> 18:00.192
( knocks )

18:05.332 --> 18:08.083
- Dick.
- Hello.

18:12.339 --> 18:15.040
What are you doing here?
How'd you find me?

18:15.092 --> 18:16.792
I was in LA.
I called your folks.

18:16.844 --> 18:18.460
They told me you were in town.

18:18.512 --> 18:20.295
Uh-huh.

18:20.347 --> 18:22.047
And they sent
you here for what?

18:22.099 --> 18:24.299
The didn't tell me
anything but your address.

18:24.351 --> 18:26.768
Patty's pretty mad
I gave you money.

18:26.804 --> 18:28.720
Well, that's more than she did.

18:28.772 --> 18:30.138
Do you have any liquor?

18:30.190 --> 18:31.556
I've been drinking beer
all night.

18:31.558 --> 18:34.393
Sit down.
I'll make coffee.

18:39.283 --> 18:41.116
( sighs )

18:42.870 --> 18:44.536
What's going on?

18:44.571 --> 18:48.991
Nothing much.
I'm retired.

18:49.043 --> 18:51.159
Been on the road.

18:51.211 --> 18:53.495
Just wanted to see
how you were doing.

18:53.547 --> 18:55.047
Meet the little one.

18:55.082 --> 18:56.832
This is bullshit.

18:56.884 --> 18:58.583
Did they fly you in
from some drunk tank

18:58.635 --> 19:00.168
to make me feel guilty?

19:00.220 --> 19:01.920
Stephanie, no.

19:01.972 --> 19:03.588
What happened?

19:08.812 --> 19:10.262
He's not here.

19:10.314 --> 19:13.432
He lives with Ronnie's parents.
His dad.

19:13.434 --> 19:16.151
I understand.

19:19.323 --> 19:20.822
Listen.

19:22.659 --> 19:24.076
I also thought...

19:27.998 --> 19:29.948
this should be with you.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.118
Megan and I are...

19:33.170 --> 19:34.586
well...

19:34.621 --> 19:37.172
I'm sorry about that.

19:37.207 --> 19:39.791
Anna always wanted
you to have it.

19:39.793 --> 19:42.878
Come on, Dick. What am I
going to do with that?

19:42.930 --> 19:44.846
Fine. Sell it.

19:46.183 --> 19:47.632
Is that the problem?
Do you need money?

19:48.852 --> 19:50.802
I appreciate you
trying to help me out,

19:50.854 --> 19:53.555
but I'm pretty sure you're
the one who's in trouble.

20:00.864 --> 20:02.864
A lot has happened.

20:05.369 --> 20:07.319
Well, you're welcome
to crash here.

20:07.321 --> 20:09.037
I'm going away for a few days.

20:09.073 --> 20:10.372
I don't want to put you out.

20:10.407 --> 20:12.040
I just need a shower
and a shave.

20:14.411 --> 20:15.710
Where you going?

20:15.746 --> 20:17.662
Up the coast.

20:17.714 --> 20:20.132
It's some kind of retreat.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.170
Why don't you close your eyes?

20:25.222 --> 20:28.006
I'll open a can of stew.

20:28.058 --> 20:29.391
Okay.

20:38.068 --> 20:41.069
( gasps )
Are you trying to kill me?

20:44.074 --> 20:46.691
I'm trying to make you happy.

20:46.743 --> 20:48.743
That was our agreement.

20:52.249 --> 20:54.866
Du Maurier.
They taste like "le shit."

20:54.918 --> 20:56.701
( laughs )
I miss them.

20:56.753 --> 20:59.087
Too bad.

20:59.123 --> 21:02.174
You're done with Canada.

21:02.209 --> 21:05.343
My children live there.
You'll learn to love it.

21:05.379 --> 21:07.345
As long as I don't have
to see what's his name.

21:07.381 --> 21:10.715
Poor soul. He suddenly
discovered that he wants me.

21:12.886 --> 21:14.386
You saw Emile?

21:14.388 --> 21:16.354
Oh, he was such
a tragic figure.

21:16.390 --> 21:18.690
I hope you told him
it's too late.

21:18.725 --> 21:21.226
Not everything
is your business.

21:21.228 --> 21:23.228
Wait. Did you
sleep with him?

21:23.230 --> 21:25.397
Don't raise your voice.
You're not my husband.

21:25.399 --> 21:28.066
You went up there to divorce him.
I forbid you to see him.

21:28.068 --> 21:30.202
<i>Arrête.</i> You are the one
that will throw me over

21:30.237 --> 21:31.903
and leave me
for your secretary.

21:31.905 --> 21:34.239
You know what a low blow is?

21:34.241 --> 21:36.433
_

21:36.682 --> 21:37.883
_

21:37.884 --> 21:41.435
_

21:41.436 --> 21:43.323
_

21:43.358 --> 21:44.883
All I got was "suitcase."

21:44.918 --> 21:46.668
Yell at me slower
or in English.

21:46.720 --> 21:48.553
You live in a hotel.

21:48.589 --> 21:49.921
Go get another room.

21:49.923 --> 21:51.723
- What?
- Out!

21:51.758 --> 21:54.059
Sleep on the sofa.
The television's in there.

21:54.094 --> 21:55.343
That is your friend.

22:23.340 --> 22:25.290
You're coming with me.

22:34.885 --> 22:37.802
- Hi, Genie.
- Hi, Sally.

22:37.854 --> 22:40.105
I didn't know
you were coming home.

22:40.140 --> 22:42.807
I missed you guys.
I took the train.

22:44.561 --> 22:46.645
Is it going to happen now?

22:46.647 --> 22:48.563
Is what going to happen?

22:55.239 --> 22:56.738
Gene, go watch TV.

22:56.790 --> 22:58.206
No.

22:58.242 --> 22:59.991
Get out of here.

23:08.502 --> 23:11.503
- Where are they?
- Henry's still at work.

23:11.505 --> 23:14.673
She's lying down.
That's all she can do.

23:15.926 --> 23:18.176
I don't know
what she thinks I think,

23:18.178 --> 23:21.179
but I heard everything before
they stopped fighting.

23:22.849 --> 23:24.516
I don't know how long she has,

23:24.518 --> 23:27.352
but I'm not going
to Madrid anymore.

23:27.354 --> 23:29.521
She's not going to like that.

23:32.025 --> 23:34.693
What happened in here?
Smells like a fire.

23:36.363 --> 23:37.946
I was making dinner.

23:37.998 --> 23:39.864
Get the frying pan.

23:39.866 --> 23:41.366
I'll show you how to do it.

23:57.217 --> 23:58.967
There's someone in here.

23:59.019 --> 24:01.803
It's more communal this way.

24:01.855 --> 24:03.638
Sun salutation's at dawn,

24:03.690 --> 24:05.307
with yoga and tai chi.

24:05.359 --> 24:06.975
A silent meal
at 7:00 AM,

24:07.027 --> 24:09.477
and the seminars
begin at 9:00.

24:09.529 --> 24:10.812
Get some rest.

24:10.864 --> 24:13.365
Tomorrow is going to
be beautiful.

24:15.035 --> 24:17.202
You are so generous.

24:21.541 --> 24:24.326
Where are we?

24:24.378 --> 24:26.328
"Psychotechnics"?

24:26.380 --> 24:28.997
"Anxiety and Tension Control"?

24:29.049 --> 24:31.333
"Divorce, A Creative Experience"?

24:31.385 --> 24:34.419
Be open to this.
You might feel better.

24:34.421 --> 24:36.588
She took my money.
That's a good sign.

24:36.590 --> 24:38.089
Shh.

24:42.679 --> 24:44.979
( man snoring )

24:48.485 --> 24:51.102
Good night, Dick.

24:51.154 --> 24:53.688
( snoring continues )

24:56.513 --> 24:58.513
Careful.
He's a little sticky.

24:58.565 --> 25:00.565
I had pancakes.

25:00.601 --> 25:03.268
- ( TV playing )
- Roger: OK

25:09.743 --> 25:11.193
Do you have a minute?

25:11.245 --> 25:12.744
Of course.

25:16.166 --> 25:18.283
<i>( changes channel )</i>

25:22.089 --> 25:24.206
Look, I've been
revising my will.

25:24.258 --> 25:26.708
And with Margaret lost,

25:26.760 --> 25:29.211
I'm dividing most of my
estate between Ellery and...

25:31.882 --> 25:34.216
- Roger.
- I know you don't want it.

25:34.268 --> 25:36.551
But it's for him. And I
don't want it to put you

25:36.603 --> 25:39.221
in an awkward position when
some man you used to work with

25:39.273 --> 25:41.389
leaves your son
a small fortune.

25:41.441 --> 25:43.391
The good doctor, for example.

25:43.393 --> 25:45.227
Greg had twins with some nurse.

25:45.279 --> 25:47.445
As far as he's concerned,
Kevin never happened.

25:47.481 --> 25:50.815
- So he knows?
- No, he's just a terrible person.

25:50.868 --> 25:53.869
What about the guy you've
been hiding from me?

25:53.904 --> 25:56.655
Richard is a man of the world.

25:58.742 --> 26:01.493
Roger, this is an expensive
way to mark your territory.

26:01.545 --> 26:03.211
What? No.

26:03.247 --> 26:04.880
I've just been thinking

26:04.915 --> 26:07.215
that you get
to a point in your life

26:07.251 --> 26:08.800
where it's
the last chapter, and--

26:08.835 --> 26:10.919
Are you ill?
Is everything okay?

26:10.921 --> 26:13.972
For the time being,
but I'm getting married.

26:16.093 --> 26:19.477
Well, those skirts
are pretty short at McCann.

26:19.513 --> 26:21.563
Nah. I met her
through Megan Draper.

26:21.598 --> 26:24.065
She's old enough
to be her mother.

26:24.101 --> 26:25.934
Actually, she is her mother.

26:25.936 --> 26:28.153
( laughs )

26:30.274 --> 26:32.574
That's spectacular.

26:32.609 --> 26:34.326
What a mess.

26:34.361 --> 26:36.945
You'd be surprised.
Nobody cares.

26:36.997 --> 26:40.832
I guess somebody finally
got their timing right.

26:42.286 --> 26:43.785
So you'll accept?

26:43.787 --> 26:46.087
( sighs )

26:46.123 --> 26:47.923
If this is what
you really want,

26:47.958 --> 26:49.541
I'm not going to say no.

26:51.461 --> 26:53.762
It would be a relief
to know that no matter what

26:53.797 --> 26:55.764
our beautiful
little boy is secure.

26:55.799 --> 26:57.882
Good.

26:57.935 --> 26:59.801
Get over here.

27:02.556 --> 27:05.690
Little rich bastard.

27:05.726 --> 27:07.225
He really is, I guess.

27:07.277 --> 27:10.362
( laughs )

27:10.397 --> 27:12.113
Thank you.

27:12.149 --> 27:14.482
<i>( wind chimes tinkling )</i>

27:26.380 --> 27:27.829
I didn't want
to leave it in the room.

27:27.881 --> 27:29.664
Be open.

27:31.251 --> 27:33.001
Let's go.

27:40.594 --> 27:43.311
That's right. Just
walk around the room.

27:46.933 --> 27:48.984
<i>No aiming.</i>

27:49.019 --> 27:52.904
<i>No purpose</i>

27:52.939 --> 27:55.523
<i>other than to move your legs.</i>

27:58.695 --> 28:00.195
<i>That's it.</i>

28:00.197 --> 28:02.614
Stop.

28:05.202 --> 28:07.702
Look at the person nearest you.

28:14.711 --> 28:17.712
What does that person
make you feel?

28:19.216 --> 28:22.884
Now, find a way, without words,

28:22.886 --> 28:24.552
to communicate that feeling

28:24.554 --> 28:26.221
<i>to the other person.</i>

28:29.726 --> 28:32.060
Does hugging feel honest?

28:33.063 --> 28:35.196
( laughs )

28:46.927 --> 28:50.011
( <i>"Piano Nocturne" playing</i> )

28:50.013 --> 28:52.847
- So happy to see you.
- Me, you, as well.

28:54.017 --> 28:56.484
It's not the only
reason I came.

28:58.989 --> 29:00.822
Can we get a couple
of Bloody Marys?

29:02.776 --> 29:04.075
Holy shit.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.327
That's the tip
of the iceberg, Peggy.

29:06.363 --> 29:08.663
I never know
if that's good or bad.

29:08.698 --> 29:12.450
The director, Jeff Dole,
has two more industrials

29:12.502 --> 29:14.285
and he's asked me
to produce them.

29:14.337 --> 29:15.920
And they both need scripts.

29:15.956 --> 29:17.956
And when Ken turned
your idea in,

29:18.008 --> 29:19.958
they put him in charge
of the corporate presentation.

29:20.010 --> 29:22.627
It's got a $60,000 budget.

29:22.679 --> 29:25.046
I already have
a very demanding job.

29:25.098 --> 29:26.631
Do you have a contract?

29:28.518 --> 29:30.268
I really thought you'd
be on a beach by now.

29:30.303 --> 29:32.470
I've been to the beach.

29:32.522 --> 29:34.138
But when I talked to Ken,

29:34.191 --> 29:35.974
I realized it would be easy

29:36.026 --> 29:38.776
to turn this into an
actual production company.

29:40.063 --> 29:41.813
Eventually I could hire writers

29:41.865 --> 29:43.615
to help you with the workload.

29:43.650 --> 29:45.783
Slow down.

29:45.819 --> 29:48.119
Harris-Olson.

29:48.154 --> 29:51.039
You need two names
to make it sound real.

29:52.709 --> 29:54.292
Are you serious?

29:56.213 --> 29:57.462
Could you give us a minute?

30:01.051 --> 30:03.334
We won't answer to anyone.

30:03.386 --> 30:06.254
It'll be something of ours
with our name on it.

30:08.225 --> 30:09.841
I'm so flattered.

30:11.228 --> 30:12.927
So?

30:14.898 --> 30:17.065
I don't know.

30:17.100 --> 30:19.851
I can't believe
you're hesitating.

30:19.903 --> 30:21.402
How can you work at that place?

30:21.438 --> 30:23.488
It's a huge decision.

30:26.076 --> 30:27.859
Well, you can think about it,

30:27.911 --> 30:29.744
but I need to find someone
by the end of the week.

30:29.779 --> 30:31.613
Find a partner?

30:31.615 --> 30:34.032
Find a writer.

30:34.084 --> 30:36.084
The partnership
is just for you.

30:56.856 --> 31:00.308
You don't have to say
why you're here.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.977
Why don't you tell me how
you're feeling right now?

31:05.699 --> 31:10.485
I feel like
everyone's judging me.

31:11.821 --> 31:15.156
And how does it feel
to tell us that?

31:18.878 --> 31:20.578
Like I'm a little girl

31:20.630 --> 31:23.498
and my parents
are looking at me

31:23.550 --> 31:26.417
the way that they
look at me now.

31:29.556 --> 31:33.841
Like all I do is screw up.

31:33.893 --> 31:37.845
"You shouldn't have
dropped out of school.

31:37.897 --> 31:41.182
You shouldn't have been
with a lowlife.

31:41.234 --> 31:42.734
Shouldn't have gotten pregnant.

31:42.769 --> 31:44.769
You should have loved
being a mother."

31:49.743 --> 31:51.693
Life is full
of "shoulds."

31:51.695 --> 31:54.862
Yeah, but I made a mistake,

31:54.914 --> 31:58.032
and I just want
to get it together now.

31:59.035 --> 32:01.085
So you can be with your baby?

32:01.121 --> 32:03.621
What?
No.

32:05.709 --> 32:08.259
See?
They are judging me.

32:10.213 --> 32:12.347
Why don't you tell
Angie how it feels

32:12.382 --> 32:14.015
to hear her say that?

32:14.050 --> 32:18.219
It makes me feel small
and insignificant, Angie.

32:20.890 --> 32:23.024
What I feel

32:23.059 --> 32:25.860
when I hear about your baby

32:25.895 --> 32:27.729
is sadness.

32:31.701 --> 32:34.869
My mother left,
and I can tell you

32:34.904 --> 32:36.404
that your baby
is going to spend

32:36.406 --> 32:39.374
the rest of his life
staring at the door

32:39.409 --> 32:42.243
waiting for you to walk in.

32:45.715 --> 32:48.082
( crying )

32:49.753 --> 32:52.053
Stephanie,
is it okay if I tell you

32:52.088 --> 32:53.755
how this is making me feel?

33:09.189 --> 33:10.938
Don't listen to them.

33:10.990 --> 33:13.858
You think this is
a big laugh, don't you?

33:13.910 --> 33:16.828
You weren't raised with Jesus.

33:16.863 --> 33:18.329
You don't know
what happens to people

33:18.364 --> 33:20.114
when they believe in things.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.333
It's true.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.452
You think that I don't
want to hear the truth?

33:24.454 --> 33:28.089
I could help you.
I could move to LA.

33:28.124 --> 33:30.508
Look, I don't know
what you're doing.

33:30.543 --> 33:33.344
You show up with
some family heirloom.

33:34.964 --> 33:37.598
You're not my family.
What's the matter with you?

33:37.634 --> 33:40.852
I just know how people work.

33:40.887 --> 33:43.855
You can put this behind you.

33:43.890 --> 33:46.808
It'll get easier
as you move forward.

33:48.561 --> 33:52.396
Oh, Dick, I don't think
you're right about that.

33:55.201 --> 33:56.651
I have to lie down.

33:56.653 --> 33:58.653
I'll see you after dinner.

34:08.764 --> 34:10.565
I'm going to split.

34:10.600 --> 34:14.268
We'll, I'm going to sit here
and look at these four walls.

34:14.270 --> 34:17.021
Well, if you're not going to
work, I can try and catch up.

34:17.072 --> 34:19.072
Get the door.

34:24.831 --> 34:26.581
Do you like it here?

34:30.286 --> 34:32.753
Yeah. It's grown on me.

34:32.789 --> 34:36.290
Joan said she wants
to go into business.

34:36.292 --> 34:40.127
She's going to be a producer

34:40.129 --> 34:42.847
and I'd be her partner.

34:42.882 --> 34:45.132
Oh.

34:45.134 --> 34:47.635
You don't like that?

34:47.637 --> 34:49.971
I can have my name on the door,

34:49.973 --> 34:51.772
be my own boss.

34:51.808 --> 34:54.609
That's not a good reason.

34:54.643 --> 34:56.476
You think it'll fail?

34:56.529 --> 34:59.647
No. You have such
a rare talent.

34:59.699 --> 35:02.450
Stop looking over your shoulder
at what other people have.

35:02.485 --> 35:03.951
You don't think I can do it.

35:03.987 --> 35:06.487
I said the opposite.

35:06.539 --> 35:10.408
You're just excited
about being in charge.

35:10.460 --> 35:11.909
Working for a producer?

35:11.961 --> 35:13.244
That's not even what you do.

35:13.296 --> 35:14.996
You have no ambition.

35:15.048 --> 35:18.249
I'm just very happy
being good at my job.

35:18.301 --> 35:19.834
I've got nothing else to prove.

35:19.886 --> 35:22.503
Spoken like a failure.

35:26.809 --> 35:29.927
I hope you're really drunk,

35:29.979 --> 35:32.146
because you're going
to need an excuse.

35:32.181 --> 35:33.898
Stan.

35:33.933 --> 35:37.318
There's more to life than work.

35:41.774 --> 35:44.358

36:16.084 --> 36:18.201
Is the coast clear?

36:18.253 --> 36:21.537
Who'd you think I was talking to?
They're gone.

36:21.589 --> 36:23.923
I could eat a dozen eggs.

36:26.761 --> 36:28.211
I'm sorry, but I just found out

36:28.263 --> 36:30.046
I can't go to Old Lyme
this afternoon.

36:30.098 --> 36:32.381
Well, I just wanted you
to look at a boat.

36:32.433 --> 36:34.383
Sounds lovely.

36:34.435 --> 36:36.552
But Jeffrey says
Nathan's Frankfurters

36:36.604 --> 36:38.020
wants to show me around.

36:38.056 --> 36:40.056
Coney Island.
We can make a day of it.

36:41.609 --> 36:43.726
It's a business meeting.

36:47.782 --> 36:49.782
Because you've
started a business?

36:49.817 --> 36:52.151
We'll see.

36:52.203 --> 36:54.237
What are you doing?

36:54.289 --> 36:57.123
It's just a couple
of little projects.

36:57.158 --> 36:59.075
Don't you want to be with me?

36:59.077 --> 37:01.711
Of course.

37:01.746 --> 37:03.379
But I don't know,

37:03.414 --> 37:06.048
it seems like this might be a
chance to build something.

37:06.084 --> 37:08.384
Well, it's going to take
all your time,

37:08.419 --> 37:10.753
all your energy,
and all your attention.

37:10.755 --> 37:12.421
That's not true.

37:12.473 --> 37:14.724
It is. I did it.

37:14.759 --> 37:16.592
And you loved it.

37:16.644 --> 37:18.227
I want to be with you,

37:18.263 --> 37:20.062
and I don't want to be
rooting for you to fail

37:20.098 --> 37:22.181
so that can happen.

37:23.768 --> 37:25.601
Do you want to get married?
We can get married?

37:25.603 --> 37:27.903
<i>( telephone ringing )</i>

37:27.939 --> 37:30.606
No, I don't want to be
back where I was.

37:30.608 --> 37:32.525
This can be different.

37:32.577 --> 37:34.443
We're different people.

37:34.445 --> 37:36.579
I want you in my life.

37:36.614 --> 37:40.116

<i>( ringing continues )</i>

37:43.955 --> 37:47.423
No, but I probably should.

37:47.458 --> 37:51.093
You act like this
is happening to you,

37:51.129 --> 37:52.962
but you're making a choice.

37:53.014 --> 37:57.350
I can't just turn off
that part of myself.

37:57.385 --> 38:00.219
I would never dream
of making you choose.

38:02.890 --> 38:05.441
When something's wrong,
it's always wrong.

38:14.736 --> 38:16.152
Hello.
Joan Harris speaking.

38:16.154 --> 38:17.787
Could you please hold
for a second?

38:17.822 --> 38:20.039
Richard. Wait.

38:20.074 --> 38:21.490
You're being silly.

38:23.578 --> 38:25.411
Good luck, Joan.

38:31.336 --> 38:33.669
<i>( door closes )</i>

38:42.263 --> 38:44.930
Well, hello, Jeff.
Sorry about that.

39:01.032 --> 39:02.748
Have you seen Stephanie?

39:02.784 --> 39:05.034
She took off a few hours ago.

39:05.036 --> 39:06.836
Did she say where
she was going?

39:06.871 --> 39:08.454
I'm sorry.
I would have asked

39:08.506 --> 39:10.539
if I'd known
you needed to know, man.

39:18.716 --> 39:22.017
How do I get out of here?
My friend took the car.

39:22.053 --> 39:25.271
We can get you a car and driver
with a couple day's notice.

39:25.306 --> 39:27.690
Or you could hitch,

39:27.725 --> 39:30.059
but you'll be standing
there all day.

39:30.061 --> 39:32.061
You can thank
Charlie Manson for that.

39:32.063 --> 39:35.064
( sighs )

39:35.066 --> 39:37.116
Damn it.

39:37.151 --> 39:40.403
I'm sure you can get a ride back with
somebody by the end of the week.

39:40.405 --> 39:42.238
You're all paid up.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.240
People just come and go

39:44.242 --> 39:46.909
and no one says good-bye?

39:46.911 --> 39:49.912
I'm sorry, but people are free

39:49.914 --> 39:51.797

Did everything
fall apart without me?

40:16.524 --> 40:18.941
It's not about that.
You just took off.

40:18.943 --> 40:21.277
People were worried.

40:21.279 --> 40:23.078
What have you been doing?

40:30.621 --> 40:33.622
I don't know.

40:33.624 --> 40:35.591
I have no idea.

40:35.626 --> 40:37.793
Look...

40:37.795 --> 40:41.130
I know you get sick of
things and you run,

40:41.132 --> 40:44.600
but you can come home.

40:46.637 --> 40:48.053
Where?

40:48.105 --> 40:50.473
McCann will take you back
in a second.

40:50.475 --> 40:51.974
Apparently,
it's happened before.

40:51.976 --> 40:54.193
Don't you want to work on Coke?

40:57.281 --> 40:59.732
I can't.

40:59.784 --> 41:02.318
I can't get out of here.

41:05.456 --> 41:08.791
Don, come home.

41:11.462 --> 41:13.295
I messed everything up.

41:19.637 --> 41:21.637
I'm not the man you think I am.

41:28.646 --> 41:32.598
Don, listen to me.

41:32.650 --> 41:36.602
What did you ever do
that was so bad?

41:36.654 --> 41:39.655
I broke all my vows.

41:42.660 --> 41:44.994
I scandalized my child.

41:47.498 --> 41:50.449
I took another man's name

41:50.501 --> 41:52.167
and made...

41:55.089 --> 41:56.755
nothing of it.

41:58.292 --> 42:00.593
That's not true.

42:10.605 --> 42:13.105
I only called because I...

42:16.110 --> 42:18.444
realized I never said
good-bye to you.

42:25.953 --> 42:29.955
I don't think you should
be alone right now.

42:29.991 --> 42:33.242
I'm in a crowd.

42:33.294 --> 42:35.744
I just wanted to hear your voice.
I'll see you soon.

42:35.746 --> 42:37.296
Wait.

42:44.722 --> 42:47.506
( exhales )

42:49.093 --> 42:51.677
( breathing heavily )

43:02.106 --> 43:03.906
( telephone rings )

43:03.941 --> 43:06.775
- Rizzo.
- It's me.

43:06.777 --> 43:08.661
What do you want?

43:08.696 --> 43:11.280
I just got off
the phone with Don.

43:11.282 --> 43:14.416
Are you kidding me?
Where the hell is he?

43:14.452 --> 43:17.920
California. But he
didn't say where.

43:17.955 --> 43:19.505
And I'm really worried
about him.

43:19.540 --> 43:22.958
( sighs )
He--

43:29.133 --> 43:31.934
He always does this
and he always comes back.

43:31.969 --> 43:34.470
He's a survivor.
He's going to be okay.

43:34.522 --> 43:36.271
You didn't hear him.

43:36.307 --> 43:37.973
He wasn't making any sense.

43:38.025 --> 43:41.276
You've got to let him go.

43:41.312 --> 43:43.562
It doesn't mean you stop
caring about him.

43:49.987 --> 43:52.621
I'm sorry I said those
shitty things to you.

43:54.075 --> 43:55.791
I don't believe them.

43:55.826 --> 44:00.212
Look, you're going to do
great no matter what you do.

44:00.247 --> 44:03.549
I think you were right.

44:03.584 --> 44:05.000
I mean, I'm going to stay.

44:05.052 --> 44:08.170
Good, because
I didn't want you to leave.

44:08.222 --> 44:10.389
Then why didn't you
just say that?

44:10.424 --> 44:12.891
Because every time
I'm face to face with you,

44:12.927 --> 44:14.510
I want to strangle you.

44:16.013 --> 44:18.897
And then I miss you
when I go away.

44:18.933 --> 44:20.733
And I miss you
and I call you on the phone

44:20.768 --> 44:22.935
and I get the person
I want to talk to.

44:22.987 --> 44:24.653
That's not true.

44:24.689 --> 44:26.405
Yeah, well,
I don't know what it is,

44:26.440 --> 44:28.073
but when I'm standing
in front of you,

44:28.109 --> 44:30.192
I bring out something terrible.

44:32.780 --> 44:35.280
I think about how
you came into my life

44:35.332 --> 44:40.085
and how you drove me
crazy and now I--

44:40.121 --> 44:42.087
I don't even know
what to do with myself

44:42.123 --> 44:45.708
because all I want
to do is be with you.

44:47.294 --> 44:48.927
What?

44:48.963 --> 44:50.713
What did you just say?

44:52.466 --> 44:55.551
I want to be with you.

44:57.722 --> 44:59.221
I'm in love with you.

45:02.109 --> 45:03.692
What?

45:05.062 --> 45:07.312
I love you, Peggy.

45:09.233 --> 45:11.066
Oh, my God.

45:13.904 --> 45:15.738
That's what I thought you said.

45:18.576 --> 45:21.744
I-- I--
I don't know what to say.

45:21.746 --> 45:25.080
Whew. I feel like
I can't breathe almost.

45:25.082 --> 45:27.549
I mean, I don't even
think about you.

45:27.585 --> 45:29.802
<i>Uh...</i>

45:29.837 --> 45:32.254
I mean, I do all the time,

45:32.256 --> 45:35.257
because you're there.

45:37.428 --> 45:41.096
And you're here.

45:41.098 --> 45:43.766
And you make everything okay.

45:43.768 --> 45:45.267
You always do.

45:47.938 --> 45:50.405
No matter what.

45:56.080 --> 45:59.531
I mean, I must be.

45:59.583 --> 46:01.583
Because you're always right.

46:05.923 --> 46:08.090
I can't believe this.

46:09.760 --> 46:11.927
I think I'm in love
with you, too.

46:16.433 --> 46:18.267
I really do.

46:25.276 --> 46:26.775
Stan?

46:28.779 --> 46:30.779
Are you there?

46:36.954 --> 46:38.570
Stan?

46:42.960 --> 46:44.660
What were you saying?

46:47.131 --> 46:49.331
I love you.

47:20.966 --> 47:22.633
Are you waiting
for a phone call?

47:25.304 --> 47:26.470
What?

47:27.973 --> 47:30.341
Have you taken something?

47:37.650 --> 47:41.402
You know what? Why don't you
come with me to my seminar?

47:42.488 --> 47:44.772
I can't move.

47:44.774 --> 47:46.940
Sure you can.

47:46.992 --> 47:50.944
I'm late. I don't want
to walk in by myself.

47:58.120 --> 48:00.421
I guess what I feel

48:00.456 --> 48:04.591
is I had my hang-ups.

48:04.627 --> 48:07.878
She had her hang-ups.

48:07.930 --> 48:12.299
But one of us was willing
to reduce the conflict.

48:16.389 --> 48:20.140
How would you feel about
starting with that next time?

49:01.767 --> 49:05.736
My name's Leonard
and I don't know

49:05.771 --> 49:09.239
if there's anything that
complicated about me.

49:09.275 --> 49:11.608
And so I should be
happier, I guess.

49:12.945 --> 49:16.864
Do you remember what I said
to Daniel about "should?"

49:16.916 --> 49:19.082
Oh.

49:19.118 --> 49:23.253
Well, it's good for him.
He's interesting.

49:23.289 --> 49:27.424
But I've never been
interesting to anybody.

49:27.460 --> 49:30.427
I, um--
I work in an office.

49:32.631 --> 49:34.264
People walk right by me.

49:34.300 --> 49:37.601
I know they don't see me.

49:37.636 --> 49:41.188
And I go home and I watch
my wife and my kids.

49:43.309 --> 49:45.976
They don't look up
when I sit down.

49:51.867 --> 49:54.618
How does it feel to say that?

49:54.653 --> 49:57.321
I don't know.

50:00.493 --> 50:03.293
It's like no one cares
that I'm gone.

50:09.168 --> 50:10.968
They should love me.

50:11.003 --> 50:13.136
I mean, maybe they do,

50:13.172 --> 50:17.508
but I don't even know
what it is.

50:19.845 --> 50:23.146
You spend your whole life
thinking you're not getting it,

50:23.182 --> 50:27.484
people aren't giving it to you.

50:27.520 --> 50:32.322
Then you realize they're trying

50:32.358 --> 50:36.276
and you don't even
know what it is.

50:39.248 --> 50:42.199
I had a dream I was on a shelf

50:42.251 --> 50:44.451
in the refrigerator.

50:46.705 --> 50:51.458
Someone closes the door
and the light goes off,

50:51.460 --> 50:53.594
and I know everybody's
out there eating.

50:56.131 --> 51:00.968
And then they open the door
and you see them smiling.

51:00.970 --> 51:05.305
And they're happy to see you,

51:05.307 --> 51:09.643
but maybe they don't
look right at you,

51:09.645 --> 51:11.478
and maybe they don't pick you.

51:20.656 --> 51:22.623
And then the door closes again.

51:24.994 --> 51:26.827
The light goes off.

51:33.168 --> 51:36.553
( sighs )

51:36.589 --> 51:39.840
( sobbing )

52:03.499 --> 52:05.999
( sobbing )

52:43.038 --> 52:44.871
Welcome aboard.

How may I help you?

53:00.973 --> 53:02.806
Of course.
Please hold for Joan.

53:04.643 --> 53:06.843
This is Joan.

53:11.650 --> 53:12.933
Look at them.

53:12.985 --> 53:14.768
One day that will be us.

53:14.820 --> 53:16.653
Yeah, tomorrow.
