Toucher un raton laveur mort
n'est pas une recherche scientifique.

00:50.591 --> 00:52.228
C'mon, boy.
Take your pill.

00:57.516 --> 00:59.371
Mom, the dog won't
take his medicine.

00:59.532 --> 01:02.091
It helps if you wrap it
in a slice of cheese.

01:06.249 --> 01:06.838
Free cheese!

01:07.391 --> 01:09.214
Homer, that was
for the dog.

01:09.273 --> 01:10.678
What's happened
to us, Marge?

01:10.679 --> 01:14.375
We used to feed each other
cheese and laugh all night.

01:14.406 --> 01:16.239
Then came
the heart attacks.

01:18.419 --> 01:19.958
What's that rumble?

01:20.631 --> 01:22.349
It's a media circus.

01:22.690 --> 01:23.841
The circus!

01:24.028 --> 01:25.545
A media circus.

01:26.133 --> 01:27.285
I don't know the difference!

01:27.585 --> 01:29.279
ABC, CBS...

01:30.404 --> 01:33.087
the Christian Science
Monitor has a flat tire.

01:33.438 --> 01:34.469
I'll get the spare.

01:34.622 --> 01:37.148
No. We must wait
for God to jack us.

01:37.399 --> 01:41.483
In Springfield today, a sex scandal has
brought in reporters from around the world.

01:41.798 --> 01:44.080
Why, here's Fox News.

01:51.033 --> 01:52.689
The cause of all this commotion...

01:52.690 --> 01:55.226
is mayor and suspected
illegal immigrant Joe Quimby,

01:55.242 --> 01:59.587
named today in paternity suits
by 27 different women.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.930
Why won't you
acknowledge our love child?!

02:07.179 --> 02:09.276
that is not my baby.

02:11.382 --> 02:13.067
Raise this as your own.

02:17.013 --> 02:18.977
This is the most
exciting scandal

02:18.978 --> 02:20.927
since the Juice
was on the loose.

02:21.117 --> 02:22.913
The Juice is still
on the loose.

02:23.905 --> 02:27.253
Mr. Mayor, just how many
illegitimate children are you hiding?

02:27.404 --> 02:29.151
Kent, I'm hiding nothing...

02:29.316 --> 02:31.288
Except this puppy.

02:33.058 --> 02:36.096
Look into his eyes
and tell me I'm lying.

02:36.344 --> 02:40.140
Well, I'm placated, and so are all
my friends in the local media.

02:41.798 --> 02:42.655
I have a question.

02:42.877 --> 02:45.047
Chloe Talbot,
Global News Network.

02:45.221 --> 02:49.229
it seems a big shot reporter
from some major news outlet

02:49.458 --> 02:51.016
isn't satisfied.

02:51.196 --> 02:53.952
Well, if it isn't local
news legend Kent Brockman.

02:53.953 --> 02:56.779
Hey, Kent, run over
any more pedestrians?

02:56.927 --> 02:58.282
Those records are sealed.

02:59.111 --> 03:00.951
She's from Springfield.

03:01.061 --> 03:02.448
I knew her in high school.

03:02.449 --> 03:05.122
I didn't think anyone successful
came from Springfield.

03:05.180 --> 03:06.908
What about that
two-headed goat?

03:07.014 --> 03:09.091
Technically, he was born
in Shelbyville.

03:09.092 --> 03:11.292
Yes, but he came here to die.

03:12.314 --> 03:14.444
One of you ate tin cans,

03:14.445 --> 03:16.018
one of you ate health food.

03:16.019 --> 03:18.484
How you solved crimes,
I'll never know.

03:18.854 --> 03:20.058
Mr. Mayor,

03:20.090 --> 03:22.144
you claim to be
faithful to your wife,

03:22.336 --> 03:25.515
but I have obtained
this exclusive video tape.

03:27.779 --> 03:30.076
Come on, baby,
read my sash.

03:30.106 --> 03:32.281
You're the major?

03:32.336 --> 03:34.717
That's mayor,
you fertile moron.

03:35.370 --> 03:37.045
Two things are certain--

03:37.207 --> 03:38.773
the mayor is in deep trouble,

03:38.914 --> 03:41.650
and the local newsmen
in this town are idiots.

03:41.927 --> 03:43.612
Channel Six News rocks.

03:43.670 --> 03:47.339
A car chase every night, or the
weather girl wears a tube top.

03:47.420 --> 03:49.844
And if she doesn't,
you win a pizza.

03:51.884 --> 03:54.703
Chloe sure turned out
successful.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.489
You're successful,
too, Mom.

03:56.641 --> 04:00.057
You made a chore wheel
that's both fair and wise.

04:09.292 --> 04:12.588
Marge, I figured out a way we
can get in on this Quimby lawsuit.

04:12.629 --> 04:13.560
Bart, go ahead.

04:13.718 --> 04:18.108
Mayor Quimby is my father.
Give me one million dollars.

04:21.815 --> 04:25.880
Diamond Joe's got to go!
Diamond Joe's got to go!

04:27.946 --> 04:30.074
Mr. Mayor, will you answer
one question?

04:30.192 --> 04:32.145
Only if it is submitted
in writing.

04:35.210 --> 04:36.268
Checkmate.

04:36.747 --> 04:37.295
Marge?

04:37.550 --> 04:38.206
Marge Simpson?

04:38.494 --> 04:41.383
Chloe, hi.

04:43.488 --> 04:44.989
where are you living now?

04:45.657 --> 04:46.648
Evergreen Terrace.

04:46.871 --> 04:47.642
Paris?

04:47.891 --> 04:49.933
Just like you always dreamed.

04:50.127 --> 04:51.212
Terrace.

04:51.410 --> 04:53.039
Evergreen Terrace.

04:53.169 --> 04:54.754
The street that
smells like pee.

04:54.949 --> 04:56.292
This is my daughter,

04:56.463 --> 04:57.159
Lisa.

04:57.507 --> 05:00.381
Chloe, I really admire
how you got out of Springfield

05:00.382 --> 05:02.043
and became such a success.

05:02.245 --> 05:04.335
Hey, only the lame-os stay.

05:04.532 --> 05:05.966
And your mother.

05:06.391 --> 05:07.194
Super lady.

05:08.832 --> 05:10.799
Well,  it is good
to see you, Chloe.

05:10.975 --> 05:13.007
Would you like to come over
for dinner tomorrow?

05:13.247 --> 05:14.830
Oh, I'd love to.

05:14.984 --> 05:17.706
I'm getting so sick of
these greasy catered meals.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.239
You insult me, you insult Italy.

05:21.423 --> 05:22.513
Which is shaped like a boot.

05:22.561 --> 05:23.418
Who knew?

05:29.414 --> 05:30.632
Homer Simpson.

05:30.939 --> 05:34.335
I sawed you
on the television.

05:34.531 --> 05:36.545
I remember you
from high school.

05:36.730 --> 05:38.702
You barfed in my tuba.

05:38.904 --> 05:41.170
I believe it was
the school's tuba.

05:45.538 --> 05:47.670
These kebabs you made....

05:47.670 --> 05:50.832
are as good or better than
anything I've ever had at this table.

05:51.890 --> 05:52.646
Homer.

05:52.849 --> 05:55.193
Oh, Marge,
I'm just being polite.

05:59.156 --> 06:01.715
My back pain's completely cured.

06:03.687 --> 06:05.119
That was one too many.

06:06.416 --> 06:09.033
I got the recipe for these
in Istanbul.

06:09.265 --> 06:10.552
More.

06:12.719 --> 06:14.923
I was writing a story
for Harper's Magazine.

06:15.099 --> 06:16.164
Harper's Magazine.

06:16.365 --> 06:18.998
I have a picture of
Lewis Lapham on my binder.

06:21.478 --> 06:24.406
Oh, but I've been yapping
about myself all night.

06:24.770 --> 06:27.602
Marge, what's exciting
in your life lately?

06:27.777 --> 06:28.766
Well...

06:29.725 --> 06:34.329
We finally found out why the dog
was scooting around on his butt all day.

06:34.866 --> 06:38.075
Turns  out he had an
impacted anal gland.

06:42.711 --> 06:44.232
The excitement
never stops.

06:44.998 --> 06:47.864
Chloe, would you like to see
slides of our trip to Athens...

06:48.152 --> 06:50.437
Boulevard Recreational Center?

06:50.547 --> 06:51.754
I'd love to...

06:52.076 --> 06:53.518
Ooh, my show's on.

06:53.562 --> 06:54.684
Mind if we watch a little?

06:54.842 --> 06:55.969
I guess.

06:56.347 --> 06:57.996
The Talbot Report

06:58.212 --> 06:59.235
with Chloe Talbot.

07:01.376 --> 07:04.056
Tonight, Chloe
interviews Bob Dylan.

07:04.262 --> 07:05.402
So Bob,

07:05.551 --> 07:07.641
what religion
are you converting to now?

07:07.948 --> 07:11.211
Well, I'll tell you one thing...

07:16.082 --> 07:16.716
...shalom.

07:16.880 --> 07:17.761
Followed by

07:17.930 --> 07:21.399
Chloe's  triumphant return  to
her depressing little  hometown:

07:21.581 --> 07:22.508
Springfield.

07:23.156 --> 07:23.628
Hello, Ned.

07:23.858 --> 07:25.732
Hey, Comic Book Guy,

07:25.880 --> 07:27.306
Krusty the Clown...

07:27.539 --> 07:28.679
I thought he was dead.

07:29.057 --> 07:32.837
Yeah? I guess you ain't been to too
many supermarket openings lately.

07:34.557 --> 07:37.359
You know, Chloe, some of
us stayed in this town

07:37.360 --> 07:38.666
and made it a better place.

07:38.951 --> 07:40.089
Oh, come on, Marge.

07:40.300 --> 07:42.501
The only reason we don't
move out of this dunghill

07:42.508 --> 07:44.945
is because of my court-
ordered ankle bracelet.

07:45.827 --> 07:47.592
I'm here! I'm here!
Quit buggin' me.

07:47.728 --> 07:50.253
Why do you always have
to show that to company?

07:50.516 --> 07:52.298
It's a conversation starter.

07:56.390 --> 07:59.842
This is the dance the Chinese
government makes dissidents perform

07:59.992 --> 08:01.159
before they shoot them.

08:10.272 --> 08:11.689
Homer, what are you doing?

08:11.908 --> 08:13.193
I swallowed a chicken bone.

08:18.283 --> 08:20.767
Chloe, you've lived so many
fascinating places.

08:20.964 --> 08:23.046
Yes, but down deep in my heart,

08:23.194 --> 08:25.995
I'll always be the girl who
wanted to leave Springfield.

08:26.212 --> 08:27.699
Gee, with all that travel,

08:27.858 --> 08:31.144
you probably haven't had much
time to find that special someone.

08:31.457 --> 08:32.759
Oh, I've had a few flings.

08:33.558 --> 08:34.315
Bill Clinton.

08:35.070 --> 08:36.065
Schwarzenneger.

08:36.066 --> 08:37.034
Oh, excuse me.

08:37.255 --> 08:40.107
But not all of us can be
as lucky as you, Marge.

08:40.323 --> 08:42.024
Homer's a wonderful man.

08:44.706 --> 08:46.635
Did you just swallow
another bone?

08:46.957 --> 08:47.799
Same one.

08:49.104 --> 08:50.382
Chloe is amazing.

08:50.588 --> 08:53.398
Even her serving bowl
smells glamorous.

08:54.787 --> 08:56.417
That's ridiculous.

08:56.603 --> 08:59.163
No one's bowl smells...

09:00.022 --> 09:02.515
It's like Christmas in Aspen.

09:04.951 --> 09:08.418
Did you know back in high school
that she'd be such a star?

09:08.615 --> 09:10.325
Back then, we
were both stars...

09:10.598 --> 09:13.905
in the thrill-a-minute world
of high school journalism.

09:17.035 --> 09:20.473
Together we broke the biggest
story of the semester.

09:20.795 --> 09:24.178
One of the cafeteria workers
was spitting in the soup.

09:24.456 --> 09:27.131
I'll teach you to give me my
first job out of prison.

09:29.245 --> 09:30.683
When we published the story,

09:30.879 --> 09:33.636
we received the school's
highest award.

09:33.903 --> 09:37.173
Ladies, it is my great pleasure to
award you these certificates of merit.

09:37.174 --> 09:39.090
In this box marked "honoree,"

09:39.343 --> 09:40.357
fill in your names.

09:40.573 --> 09:42.520
And over here,
write in what you did.

09:42.682 --> 09:43.366
I'll be back.

09:43.522 --> 09:45.665
You ain't tasted
the last of my spit.

09:47.114 --> 09:48.723
Oh, that Moe.

09:49.015 --> 09:50.444
But good for you, Mom!

09:50.631 --> 09:53.023
Why didn't you follow Chloe
into journalism?

09:53.237 --> 09:55.492
Well, we both faced
a tough decision...

09:56.857 --> 09:58.570
...go off to journalism school,

09:58.735 --> 10:01.875
or stay in Springfield
with our sweethearts.

10:06.243 --> 10:07.303
Stay with me, Marge,

10:07.498 --> 10:09.742
and I promise we'll travel
the world...

10:09.930 --> 10:11.401
and perhaps outer space.

10:24.366 --> 10:25.485
I love you, Chloe...

10:25.689 --> 10:28.053
and I love you
too, brake fluid.

10:32.912 --> 10:35.495
Chloe left town
as soon as Barney proposed.

10:35.817 --> 10:37.147
I would've followed her,

10:37.271 --> 10:38.528
but  my plans changed

10:38.746 --> 10:42.288
when God brought me a
wonderful little boy...

10:42.377 --> 10:43.689
Bart,  stop that!

10:44.042 --> 10:45.550
This isn't what it looks like.

10:49.637 --> 10:52.430
Why would Homer write
his name in grime?

10:56.050 --> 10:57.589
Ah, that's better.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.764
Mom, Chloe just won
the Peabody Award!

11:02.054 --> 11:05.629
Well, I just made the bathroom
floor smell like lemons.

11:05.808 --> 11:07.762
Where's the award for that?

11:07.955 --> 11:10.087
Oh, Mom, don't feel bad.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.972
Everybody
appreciates your...

11:12.810 --> 11:14.370
I'm late for my dinner...

11:14.406 --> 11:16.659
with Chloe!

11:19.968 --> 11:20.724
Good news, Marge!

11:20.972 --> 11:24.098
I've learned to walk
naked on stilts!

11:30.562 --> 11:34.602
There's  Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw
hanging out with Kent Brockman!

11:34.816 --> 11:37.133
You want your mic back,
local anchor?

11:37.291 --> 11:39.231
This just in...
I'm pissed off!

11:39.402 --> 11:40.644
Hi, fellas!

11:41.378 --> 11:43.527
Chloe, wanna
feel my muscle?

11:44.341 --> 11:46.585
Chloe has such
an amazing life.

11:48.734 --> 11:52.231
I wonder what would have happened
if I'd stuck with journalism.

11:52.391 --> 11:55.083
Oh, honey, her life can't
compare to yours.

11:55.311 --> 11:56.850
You've got three kids,

11:57.019 --> 11:59.486
a TV tray from Expo '67,

11:59.643 --> 12:01.572
and you're married
to King Stink!

12:01.869 --> 12:03.296
Yeah, I guess.

12:03.581 --> 12:04.855
Marge, listen to me.

12:05.031 --> 12:06.475
Chloe may have a flashy job,

12:06.476 --> 12:08.194
but you're the backbone
of this family.

12:09.183 --> 12:12.094
You're like the electrical tape that
holds the two halves of my car together.

12:12.344 --> 12:14.368
That's a sweet
thought, Homie.

12:14.629 --> 12:16.528
I just hate to see
you upset, honey.

12:17.289 --> 12:20.188
You know what would be
a good name for Maggie?

12:20.725 --> 12:22.030
Chloe !

12:23.936 --> 12:26.147
That was such
an exciting night.

12:26.148 --> 12:29.966
Morley Safer has the biggest
head I've ever seen.

12:30.207 --> 12:31.845
I really had fun.

12:32.957 --> 12:35.673
It's gonna be a let-down
going to school tomorrow.

12:35.849 --> 12:37.950
We have to make
a pilgrim out of felt.

12:39.715 --> 12:43.475
I'm covering the U.N. Women's
Conference in Capital City tomorrow.

12:43.628 --> 12:44.809
You want to come with me?

12:45.674 --> 12:46.839
That'd be wonderful!

12:47.132 --> 12:49.402
I'd... I'd have
to ask my Mom.

12:49.516 --> 12:50.915
Well, you can ask her right now.

12:51.106 --> 12:53.100
She's glaring at us
from the front lawn.

12:55.230 --> 12:57.606
Marge, it's my fault
we're a little late.

12:57.793 --> 13:01.908
How dare you show my daughter
a life of fun and possibility?

13:02.802 --> 13:05.193
Keep your dish-washing
hands off the Armani!

13:05.372 --> 13:06.856
For your information,

13:06.857 --> 13:09.779
our electric dishwasher
is on the fritz.

13:11.087 --> 13:14.839
Not that you care about the
ups and downs of my appliances.

13:14.840 --> 13:17.065
Do ya? Huh, do ya?

13:17.691 --> 13:18.535
That's it!

13:18.694 --> 13:21.792
I'm going to show you some moves
I learned from G. Gordon Liddy!

13:21.950 --> 13:23.549
I'm so sick of names!

13:31.808 --> 13:32.637
Ladies!

13:33.733 --> 13:35.826
There is no need
to fight over me.

13:36.081 --> 13:37.993
No one's fighting over you!

13:38.184 --> 13:40.021
Oh. Well, then, carry on.

13:42.352 --> 13:43.945
You don't know
when to quit!

13:48.526 --> 13:49.864
"Shiner-Be-Gone."

14:09.454 --> 14:13.107
Lisa, honey, let me explain
what happened tonight.

14:13.290 --> 14:16.594
Sometimes when your mom
has half a glass of wine,

14:16.857 --> 14:18.722
she goes cuckoo bananas.

14:19.935 --> 14:23.608
So is it okay if I go to the
women's conference with Chloe?

14:23.766 --> 14:25.607
Let me think about it.

14:26.206 --> 14:26.723
No.

14:40.171 --> 14:42.018
I've never disobeyed Mom before.

14:42.265 --> 14:44.942
Is this a step I'm really willing to take?

14:45.685 --> 14:47.512
I don't know.
The more I think about it...

14:48.612 --> 14:50.241
Thinking is for losers!

14:50.502 --> 14:51.355
Bart!

14:51.444 --> 14:53.678
Thanks for helping me
make up my mind.

14:54.014 --> 14:55.501
Thanks for cushioning my fall.

14:55.571 --> 14:57.216
I didn't cushion your...

15:01.292 --> 15:03.335
I saw your report
on Kuala Lumpur.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.031
Truly hard-hitting.

15:05.166 --> 15:07.459
Thanks, Tom.
I really appreciate that.

15:07.625 --> 15:10.178
So, I, you know, I was wondering...
- Yes?

15:11.705 --> 15:15.006
Would you like to come to my
celebrity racquetball tournament?

15:15.185 --> 15:16.539
I'll have to check
my schedule.

15:18.897 --> 15:20.988
I'll give you
a first-round bye.

15:21.015 --> 15:22.146
Gotta go, Tom.

15:22.191 --> 15:23.346
I'll think about it.

15:26.714 --> 15:28.951
Lisa, breakfast!

15:29.203 --> 15:30.923
I know you're mad at me,

15:31.102 --> 15:33.385
but I hope you're not mad
at Cap'n Crunch.

15:38.978 --> 15:40.860
Homer, we've
gotta get Lisa!

15:41.106 --> 15:41.836
All right.

15:42.044 --> 15:44.917
While I'm gone, boy,
you think about what you did.

15:45.775 --> 15:46.565
What did I do?

15:46.947 --> 15:48.970
You, uh...
Why, you little...!

15:50.593 --> 15:52.948
Need a reason
for strangling, do ya?

15:53.371 --> 15:54.772
I'll fix your wagon!

15:59.452 --> 16:00.187
Hello.

16:00.188 --> 16:01.925
Chloe, forget about
the women's conference!

16:02.066 --> 16:03.570
I need you to get over
to Mount Springfield.

16:03.743 --> 16:04.869
It's about to erupt!

16:05.074 --> 16:07.871
Don't we have a reporter who
specializes in natural disasters?

16:08.060 --> 16:10.454
Yeah, he's busy covering
Julia Roberts' last haircut.

16:11.699 --> 16:12.700
But seriously, he's dead.

16:12.894 --> 16:13.827
Now get going!

16:25.117 --> 16:25.841
Hey, there!

16:25.973 --> 16:26.748
The name's Chet.

16:27.116 --> 16:30.028
I'm your cameraman
for this here 'cano story.

16:30.159 --> 16:33.830
Let's see. I've been to
Afghanistan, Serbia, Lebanon...

16:37.227 --> 16:38.402
Okay, okay, I lied.

16:38.570 --> 16:40.999
I shoot wedding videos

16:43.136 --> 16:44.021
Just Fort Worth!

16:46.055 --> 16:47.955
Hello, U.N. Women's Conference!

17:00.511 --> 17:01.238
We're trapped!

17:01.572 --> 17:03.194
Lisa, we may not make it,

17:03.343 --> 17:06.117
but at least we can go out as the great
journalists we are. I'm not a journalist.

17:06.347 --> 17:07.825
I'm not a journalist.

17:08.064 --> 17:09.229
You are now.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.146
Remember to keep
my boobs in the shot.

17:11.381 --> 17:13.817
And we're on
in five, four, three...

17:18.708 --> 17:21.069
I don't see Lisa
in any of the seminars.

17:21.329 --> 17:23.828
And I'm growing ashamed
of my penis.

17:24.568 --> 17:25.367
Homer, look!

17:25.635 --> 17:28.481
I'm here at the long-dormant
Springfield Volcano,

17:28.728 --> 17:31.625
which is now spewing noxious
debris into the air.

17:31.814 --> 17:32.506
How male.

17:33.996 --> 17:36.061
With me is my
eight-year-old cameragirl,

17:36.229 --> 17:37.162
Lisa Simpson.

17:38.963 --> 17:42.397
She's taken my daughter
to an erupting volcano?

17:42.502 --> 17:44.004
That's it!

17:44.007 --> 17:46.088
She is off the Christmas card list.

17:46.164 --> 17:47.573
Marge, that's crazy talk.

17:47.731 --> 17:49.377
Now look.
I'll save Lisa.

17:49.433 --> 17:50.633
Your place is here
with the women.

17:52.152 --> 17:53.763
Okay, you go save Lisa.

17:53.921 --> 17:55.194
I'll stay here
with the women.

17:56.638 --> 17:58.608
What do women want?!

18:01.425 --> 18:02.865
We've gotta go now!

18:03.068 --> 18:06.599
Okay. I'll run as fast as I can,
but I'm full of potato salad.

18:11.832 --> 18:12.836
I'm sorry, folks.

18:12.982 --> 18:14.113
You're not allowed
to go up there.

18:14.412 --> 18:16.098
In fact, I don't even
know why I'm here.

18:16.325 --> 18:18.979
This lava is not a criminal.
It hasn't hurt anybody.

18:23.596 --> 18:24.774
Anybody I know.

18:25.084 --> 18:26.769
Chief, my daughter's up there.

18:26.978 --> 18:28.379
You're a father, too.

18:28.545 --> 18:29.953
Yeah, but I'm
a cop first...

18:30.158 --> 18:31.505
then a boat enthusiast...

18:31.669 --> 18:34.112
amateur historian...
yo-yo dieter...

18:34.246 --> 18:35.671
then I'm a cop again...

18:35.674 --> 18:37.763
Help! Help!

18:37.941 --> 18:41.006
So much sulfur dioxide!

18:41.186 --> 18:43.030
I'm coming, sweetheart!

18:49.321 --> 18:51.346
I'll save you, Lisa!

18:57.526 --> 18:58.991
Be careful, Mom!

18:59.134 --> 19:01.303
There's hot lava
under the ground!

19:01.740 --> 19:03.472
Actually, when
it's underground,

19:03.683 --> 19:05.868
lava is called magma.

19:06.162 --> 19:08.300
You're so smart,
Chloe!

19:08.590 --> 19:11.173
Walter Cronkite told me
the same thing.

19:11.460 --> 19:12.371
Shut up!

19:26.648 --> 19:28.271
Mom, that
was incredible!

19:28.463 --> 19:31.974
Nothing's more powerful
than a mother's love.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.993
Mom, your hair!

19:34.274 --> 19:37.380
Don't worry. We've got two hours
before it burns down to my head.

19:37.537 --> 19:39.161
Our top story tonight:

19:39.319 --> 19:40.487
I'm about to die!

19:47.046 --> 19:49.073
Barney, you
saved my life.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.827
Chloe, when you left me,
I was devastated.

19:52.019 --> 19:54.716
But I sobered up long
enough to become a pilot.

19:54.885 --> 19:56.268
With you beside me,

19:56.403 --> 19:58.603
I think I could
make it work.

19:59.873 --> 20:01.578
How 'bout a half hour
of pity sex?

20:01.782 --> 20:03.348
Is there any
other kind?

20:11.277 --> 20:13.425
In the wake of the
devastating eruption,

20:13.470 --> 20:15.360
one Springfielder proved
herself a hero:

20:15.627 --> 20:16.904
Marge Simpson.

20:17.301 --> 20:18.994
She's won herself
a free hero...

20:19.231 --> 20:21.532
sandwich at Springfield
Sub Shops.

20:22.067 --> 20:23.725
Extra charge
for warm-ups!

20:24.028 --> 20:25.397
Mom, I wanna be just like you.

20:25.637 --> 20:26.596
I mean the lava part,

20:26.820 --> 20:27.703
not saving Lisa.

20:27.907 --> 20:29.655
Pretend to care!

20:32.016 --> 20:33.692
Well, looking at you kids,

20:33.882 --> 20:36.555
I know I made
the right choice in life.

20:36.850 --> 20:38.395
I'm sure you did.

20:38.621 --> 20:39.912
But  still, don't you ever wonder

20:39.913 --> 20:42.201
what might  have happened if
things had gone differently?

20:42.364 --> 20:42.960
Well...

20:44.998 --> 20:46.537
This is Marge Simpson

20:46.538 --> 20:48.336
reporting from Lake Placid

20:48.513 --> 20:52.006
where  the miracle on
ice never happened.

20:52.832 --> 20:54.384
No!

21:02.803 --> 21:04.664
Lisa, what are you doing
in there?

21:04.828 --> 21:05.920
Praying to Buddha,

21:06.128 --> 21:07.727
Jesus, SpongeBob.

21:07.893 --> 21:09.116
There's no time
to be picky.

21:09.819 --> 21:11.237
Perhaps we should help.

21:11.415 --> 21:12.196
Screw her!

21:13.305 --> 21:19.507
