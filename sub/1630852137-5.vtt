WEBVTT

00:05.960 --> 00:07.240
With Christmas coming up,

00:07.280 --> 00:10.480
the 20/21 season is nearing
its halfway point.

00:11.400 --> 00:14.080
Juventus is in the midst of a renewal,

00:14.160 --> 00:15.600
but a bad loss

00:15.680 --> 00:18.440
shows that the team
needs to find an identity.

00:18.520 --> 00:19.800
Fiorentina ahead.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.600
It's 3-0, here in Turin.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.920
The club has put its faith
in the younger players,

00:25.000 --> 00:27.680
which paid off with goals
against the leading team.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.000
McKennie!

00:32.480 --> 00:34.840
Will this alchemy be the key to success?

00:34.920 --> 00:36.640
And so ends the game.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.320
Only the rest of the season will tell.

00:48.080 --> 00:51.320
It's early January,
and Juventus is playing Genoa

00:51.400 --> 00:53.440
in the first game of the Italian Cup

00:53.520 --> 00:56.360
in search their fourth consecutive
advantageous result.

00:56.440 --> 00:59.080
These are the two midfielders.

00:59.480 --> 01:02.720
Pass to their sides.
Strong ball, goes wide.

01:03.080 --> 01:06.400
Lateral, you. Control it and play forward.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.360
After missing 12 games due to injury,

01:09.440 --> 01:12.280
captain Giorgio Chiellini
returns to the field.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.000
TURIN
JANUARY 13, 2021

01:18.080 --> 01:20.120
A new competition, a new beginning.

01:20.200 --> 01:24.200
As they start out,
Juventus is looking to dominate

01:24.280 --> 01:26.640
the 2020/2021 Italian Cup.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.960
Single-elimination, round of 16,
the winner moves on.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.960
The loser is out of the running.

01:32.040 --> 01:35.400
The goal is the same as always,
to go all the way.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.520
And here we go with Juventus-Genoa.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.480
Faster!

01:41.560 --> 01:43.680
Chiellini. Looks for Kulusevski.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.840
Kulusevski! Juventus takes the lead!

01:47.920 --> 01:50.520
For Chiellini,
it's as if no time has passed.

01:50.640 --> 01:53.520
Ninety seconds in,
he sets up Kulusevski's goal.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.520
A wonderful assist by Chiellini!

01:55.600 --> 01:57.040
It's 1-0, Juventus!

01:57.760 --> 02:01.760
It's Kulusevski, looking to score,
kicks to Morata, Morata!

02:02.400 --> 02:03.600
Álvaro Morata!

02:03.680 --> 02:05.840
It's 2-0, 23 minutes in,

02:05.920 --> 02:09.040
Juventus' offensive tandem works.

02:10.280 --> 02:12.080
But Genoa does not give up.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.440
Genoa scores.

02:13.520 --> 02:15.400
And the ball goes into the net.

02:15.440 --> 02:16.400
And it's a tie,

02:16.440 --> 02:19.280
forcing Juventus into overtime.

02:19.360 --> 02:22.120
At this delicate moment,
Pirlo, surprisingly,

02:22.240 --> 02:26.600
decides to bring in the under-23 rookie
Hamza Rafia.

02:26.680 --> 02:31.280
Substitution for Juventus.
Coming in, it's number 50, Hamza Rafia.

02:32.880 --> 02:33.840
Wide for Morata

02:33.880 --> 02:37.160
who pounces in, Morata, the cross, Rafia!

02:39.800 --> 02:40.880
Rafia!

02:41.800 --> 02:43.880
Hamza Rafia in his debut!

02:44.080 --> 02:46.840
Juventus 3, Genoa 2.

02:47.960 --> 02:52.320
The 21-year-old Tunisian
wins the quarter-finals for Juventus.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.840
The contribution of young people
to the team's victories

03:05.920 --> 03:10.080
is the result of the great work done
by Juventus at the Vinovo Center.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.800
I live the daily routine
of the first team,

03:14.040 --> 03:17.440
maintaining a responsibility
for what's underneath...

03:19.400 --> 03:22.240
...the under-23s, the youth teams
and the women's team.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.720
Young players train here

03:25.800 --> 03:28.240
who will become future Juventus champions.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.360
It moves me to see
12- and 13-year-old kids,

03:33.440 --> 03:36.160
and then maybe see them a few years later

03:36.240 --> 03:39.520
as established players
who might be playing Serie A soccer.

03:51.080 --> 03:54.080
Their next game will be
among the trickiest.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.480
Juventus will be playing Inter
and Antonio Conte,

03:58.160 --> 04:00.400
a former Juventus player and coach.

04:01.280 --> 04:04.760
For Pirlo and the veterans,
Conte is an opponent to overcome

04:04.880 --> 04:07.000
and a threat to the scudetto.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.680
Before meeting the press,

04:09.760 --> 04:13.160
Pirlo speaks with Press Office Chief
Gabriella Ravizzotti,

04:13.280 --> 04:15.560
First Team Press Officer Riccardo Coli

04:15.680 --> 04:18.760
and Chief Football Officer Fabio Paratici.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.520
Conte already spoke two minutes ago.

04:22.640 --> 04:26.600
They will certainly place a lot
of emphasis on what it's like to face

04:26.680 --> 04:29.680
the one who inspired your choice and is

04:30.360 --> 04:34.440
connected to you by a special relationship
more than any other coach.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.880
And on the roster too, I think,
because he plays

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
on the quality of the roster,
that's also a theme.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.760
We're a little bit higher.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.800
It's two rosters, both very...

04:44.880 --> 04:48.120
Us with the younger guys
and them with the experienced ones.

04:48.200 --> 04:51.000
-Two totally different lines.
-Right.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.720
They've made choices

04:54.800 --> 04:59.560
for the present,
and we've made them for the future.

04:59.640 --> 05:03.160
Playing Conte as a coach is strange,

05:03.480 --> 05:07.800
because, not so long ago, he was my coach.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.640
He remains a special person to me.

05:13.360 --> 05:18.000
The night before the game,
Pirlo and Technical Coach Roberto Baronio

05:18.120 --> 05:21.200
analyze Inter's games so far this season.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.360
You used to say,

05:22.520 --> 05:25.360
"If ever I'm a coach,
I'll do what Antonio does."

05:25.800 --> 05:27.240
Yes, but I didn't do it.

05:27.320 --> 05:30.120
Well, maybe you have
two different concepts.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.240
He was the one who got me thinking,

05:32.320 --> 05:36.920
"With all the things he tells me
in the videos, I can coach too."

05:37.000 --> 05:39.280
He tells you every last detail,

05:39.360 --> 05:40.800
everything becomes easier.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.960
He was tough when he played.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.400
-Yes.
-He is as a coach too, though...

05:46.960 --> 05:49.360
-When he played, he was a hammer.
-Yes.

05:49.440 --> 05:50.960
The little tiger!

05:51.080 --> 05:52.680
I'm going to bed, Daddy.

05:52.760 --> 05:54.520
-Good night!
-Going to bed?

05:54.600 --> 05:56.120
They want to say good night.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.440
Nice shoes.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.640
Nice slippers.

06:01.720 --> 06:02.920
Big belly!

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
MILAN
JANUARY 17, 2021

06:17.400 --> 06:19.480
Welcome to Italy's derby,

06:19.560 --> 06:22.040
one of Italian soccer's biggest games,

06:22.120 --> 06:24.240
one of the biggest challenges.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.400
Andrea Pirlo versus Antonio Conte.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.240
Many duels within the game.

06:29.920 --> 06:32.800
The long-term goal is the scudetto.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.920
In the short term, three points.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.400
Puglia is a passionate place.

06:37.480 --> 06:41.720
Here, Juventus fans have not forgiven
fellow Antonio Conte

06:41.800 --> 06:45.200
for having become coach
of arch-enemy Inter.

06:45.760 --> 06:48.560
The Derby of Italy is
also in our pizzeria.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.640
Juventus fan against Inter fan. Giuseppe!

06:51.920 --> 06:54.720
The Inter fan pizza maker, there he is.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.560
I'm a restaurateur.
Juventus fans come here

06:57.720 --> 07:00.440
from all over
because I'm quite well-known.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.960
A competition of fascination and passion,

07:03.040 --> 07:05.720
competitive spirit and charisma.
Go, Juventus.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.880
Seven points separate the teams
in Inter's favor.

07:12.520 --> 07:15.000
For Pirlo, it's a chance
to make up some ground

07:15.080 --> 07:17.880
and test himself against
his friend and mentor.

07:20.200 --> 07:23.200
Conte and Pirlo embrace, Giuseppe.

07:23.560 --> 07:26.160
The student will surpass
the master tonight.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.680
We'll see.

07:28.920 --> 07:32.040
The field is one thing,
friendship is another.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.720
On the field, you can fight, maybe argue.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.520
He's very energetic.

07:37.600 --> 07:42.560
I'm much quieter and calm,
but then with regard to soccer,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.080
we're both crazy about the sport

07:45.160 --> 07:48.280
and want to achieve victory
any way we can.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Like Conte, Vidal, now with Inter,

07:52.080 --> 07:54.400
will play his former team tonight.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.480
Look, the kiss, look!

07:56.560 --> 07:59.600
Oh, my God, Vidal is one of us! For sure.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.280
I hope it was the Judas kiss,

08:02.360 --> 08:04.560
that is, the betrayal of that shirt.

08:04.640 --> 08:07.320
Tension rises. Here they go.

08:08.560 --> 08:13.360
Here we go with Inter-Juventus,
Serie A, day 18. Chiellini.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.720
Frabotta, targets Hakimi, goes back.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.680
-Looks for Lukaku, header.
-Go, Fede.

08:18.760 --> 08:19.640
Chiesa.

08:20.480 --> 08:24.520
Number 22 again, runs down the wing,
crosses in the middle, Morata gets it,

08:24.600 --> 08:29.440
pressed by de Vrij, Morata again,
passes it to Rabiot, he shoots!

08:29.520 --> 08:31.560
Save, cross into the net, Ronaldo!

08:36.240 --> 08:37.120
It's a goal!

08:37.760 --> 08:40.040
Offside by CR7.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.840
The second assistant's flag went up.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.880
The Juventus goal is canceled.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.640
Hold on tight, Fede!

08:48.880 --> 08:52.600
Edge of the area to Vidal, hook,
spreads towards Barella,

08:52.640 --> 08:55.520
Barella inside the area, cross, header.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.080
Ball goes in.

08:57.160 --> 09:00.520
And so, it is Vidal who breaks
the Juventus fans' hearts

09:00.640 --> 09:02.600
taking Inter into the lead.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.720
Juventus is now forced

09:05.760 --> 09:07.200
to look for a comeback.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.000
Adri, there.

09:17.280 --> 09:18.240
Fede!

09:19.440 --> 09:21.480
Go, Leo, go!

09:22.240 --> 09:23.840
Follow him!

09:24.600 --> 09:27.480
Deep pass to Barella, very precise.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.240
Barella, look at this, it's Barella!

09:35.160 --> 09:36.960
Goal. Inter doubles the score.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.080
It's like they've already
won the scudetto.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.280
And so ends the game.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.080
Inter beats Juventus 2-0.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.080
You just had to score today, didn't you?

09:54.760 --> 09:57.240
It's right that there
should be criticism now.

09:57.320 --> 10:02.080
I will only be able to make it stop
with hard work and good results

10:02.160 --> 10:04.440
that the team will have to carry out.

10:06.760 --> 10:10.480
You have to fight back,
you have to move on quickly.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.640
TURIN

10:15.080 --> 10:19.280
Juventus annihilated by its exes,
Conte and Vidal.

10:19.760 --> 10:23.520
This Juventus doesn't die. It never died.

10:23.600 --> 10:27.520
It's an attempt, a work in progress,
that is not working now.

10:35.640 --> 10:39.200
The negative result versus Inter
fuels suspicion

10:39.280 --> 10:42.880
that Juventus may not win
their tenth consecutive scudetto.

10:44.480 --> 10:47.280
Yesterday was the first time I felt

10:47.440 --> 10:51.040
in 10 years, that a team
in the Italian league can beat us.

10:51.840 --> 10:52.840
It can win.

10:53.240 --> 10:55.120
But there is no time to think.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.760
In two days, Juventus plays Napoli
in the Super Cup final.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.760
This will be their first chance
to raise a trophy.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.640
Good morning.
We need to lift our heads back up.

11:05.080 --> 11:08.080
Let's forget the game of the other day.

11:08.160 --> 11:11.280
Our attitude was not right.
We were too fearful.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.760
The first 10 minutes went well,

11:13.840 --> 11:16.120
then we fell apart.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.080
Now we have the final.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.840
Finals are not played, they are won.

11:20.920 --> 11:25.200
We need to focus, recover our energy,
prepare well for tomorrow's game.

11:27.960 --> 11:31.160
Wes, when Kulu guards Manolas,

11:31.240 --> 11:33.560
then you guard Bakayoko.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.400
In the back, it's two against one.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.800
Be ready to be aggressive
if they pass to Petagna.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.280
Go, Kulu, push him out!

11:51.640 --> 11:53.880
Midfielders should be close together

11:53.960 --> 11:56.440
for maximum freedom
and play here in the middle.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.600
We'll win by playing in the middle.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.640
Let's do penalties.
We could go to penalties tomorrow.

12:01.720 --> 12:04.520
Fate has played another trick
on the coach.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.440
In the next game
he'll face off with another old friend,

12:07.520 --> 12:11.480
his former Milan and national team
teammate Gennaro Gattuso.

12:11.560 --> 12:12.880
BERLIN
JULY 9, 2004

12:12.960 --> 12:15.600
After years together
on the Milan and national teams,

12:15.680 --> 12:17.480
their friendship developed

12:17.560 --> 12:21.480
in a very classic way,
between two very different personalities,

12:21.560 --> 12:25.800
volcanic and sunny Gattuso

12:25.880 --> 12:29.720
and the more introverted and quiet Pirlo,

12:29.800 --> 12:34.640
the perfect duo, the perfect comedy duo,

12:34.720 --> 12:37.840
like Bud Spencer and Terence Hill

12:37.920 --> 12:39.760
or Laurel and Hardy.

12:40.920 --> 12:44.160
In all the rivalry
between Juventus and Napoli,

12:44.240 --> 12:46.920
the fact that the two of them
are on the bench

12:47.400 --> 12:49.200
is a breath of fresh air.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.800
You won't see any hatred there,

12:51.880 --> 12:56.000
just a great respect
and mutual admiration.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.480
TURIN
JANUARY 19, 2021

12:57.560 --> 12:59.680
It's the eve of the Super Cup final

12:59.760 --> 13:03.360
between Italian champions Juventus

13:03.440 --> 13:06.480
and the Italian Cup holders, Napoli.

13:09.280 --> 13:12.480
It should be noted
that, this season, Juventus,

13:12.560 --> 13:16.040
whenever they've had to play well,
they have.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.840
We're playing for a trophy tomorrow.

13:18.920 --> 13:23.160
We've just had a bad loss,
now's the time for us to come back.

13:23.960 --> 13:27.360
I've always liked to talk using facts,
and I hope

13:27.440 --> 13:31.560
we will play like I know we can,
regardless of the result.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.040
At the table, to ease the tension,

13:38.120 --> 13:43.400
Pirlo entertains the staff by recounting
some jokes they played on Gattuso.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.520
We once made a bet.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.120
You know the shell-less snails this big?

13:49.360 --> 13:52.320
We said, "Rino, if you eat it,

13:52.400 --> 13:55.960
"we'll give you 10,000 euros,
you can give it to the stock boys."

13:56.040 --> 13:57.920
"All right." He took the slug,

13:58.480 --> 14:01.680
swallowed it. We didn't give him shit.
He wanted to kill us.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.080
If he spoke at dinner,
we would be like, "Shh!"

14:06.160 --> 14:08.240
from the other tables. He'd go crazy.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.160
He's speak, so we'd go, "Shh!"

14:11.240 --> 14:12.480
He'd turn around,

14:13.320 --> 14:15.880
get up and start hitting someone.

14:16.360 --> 14:18.800
REGGIO EMILIA
JANUARY 20, 2021

14:18.880 --> 14:20.960
It's the morning of the Super Cup final

14:21.040 --> 14:23.240
and the tension is tangible.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.200
At stake for Coach Pirlo

14:25.280 --> 14:27.280
is his first trophy as coach,

14:27.360 --> 14:29.800
which he will have to contend
with his friend

14:29.880 --> 14:32.480
and former teammate Gennaro Gattuso.

14:33.320 --> 14:36.640
Last night was impossible
when we were in the field.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.760
-Yesterday?
-And it was 7:00 p.m.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.840
Yesterday it was 7:00 p.m.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.360
It was minus three.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.000
A few hours before the game, surprisingly,

14:47.080 --> 14:50.840
Pirlo recovers a key player
who had been taken out by Covid.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.160
Oh! What's up? Are you okay?

14:54.240 --> 14:56.120
-Good. You?
-You recovered?

14:56.200 --> 14:57.320
Very good.

14:59.600 --> 15:03.600
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, you? You okay?

15:03.680 --> 15:06.320
We're fine.
What's important is that you're fine.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.240
We've been waiting for you.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.920
It's been a tough day.

15:10.720 --> 15:14.040
I woke up at 7:00 a.m.
Had the swab, oh, my God.

15:14.880 --> 15:19.400
At 11:00 they told me
I could come in, and I was so happy.

15:19.480 --> 15:22.680
Two and a half hours by car,
and here we are,

15:22.760 --> 15:24.440
and I'm ready for the final.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.480
The Super Cup is here.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.800
It will go to the best team.

15:30.880 --> 15:33.600
Juventus and Napoli will be vying for it.

15:33.680 --> 15:37.480
For some games, the concentration
and adrenaline just come.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.600
I believe that this month
will be a measure

15:48.680 --> 15:51.320
of how much this group has progressed.

15:52.040 --> 15:52.960
Go!

15:53.040 --> 15:55.160
Juventus wants their Ninth Symphony,

15:55.240 --> 15:58.440
but to get the trophy
they will need a perfect game.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.360
Napoli plays the first ball with Petagna.

16:15.120 --> 16:18.080
Cuadrado, one on one with Mario Rui.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.160
Good, all right!

16:21.520 --> 16:23.880
Bakayoko is in trouble, Ronaldo trips.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.440
Ball to Demme, Demme in the area.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.600
He jumps in, Demme, crossing,
header, Szczęsny!

16:31.040 --> 16:33.280
Unbelievable intervention by Szczęsny!

16:36.440 --> 16:38.880
The first half ends
here at the Mapei Stadium

16:38.960 --> 16:40.960
in Reggio Emilia, 0-0.

16:46.560 --> 16:49.320
Here we go, once again, at Mapei Stadium.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.920
Let's go, come on.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.160
The second half of the 2020
Italian Super Cup is about to begin.

16:56.840 --> 17:00.240
The score is 0-0 for Juventus and Napoli.

17:02.720 --> 17:06.800
Here we go again.
Enjoy the second half of Juventus-Napoli.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.880
Good, Fede, go, inside!

17:08.960 --> 17:12.280
McKennie wants the cross,
finds it in the middle, deflection!

17:12.320 --> 17:13.560
Save by Ospina.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.800
Ronaldo, on the right,
cross into the middle!

17:16.920 --> 17:18.680
The ball is out. Nothing!

17:21.280 --> 17:24.720
The referee whistles, Bernardeschi,
header, look at this!

17:26.240 --> 17:27.480
Ronaldo scores!

17:27.760 --> 17:29.480
Juventus takes the lead!

17:31.160 --> 17:33.280
The odds have changed at Reggio Emilia,

17:33.400 --> 17:35.320
it's Juventus 1, Napoli 0.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.480
Cristiano Ronaldo,
the king has scored again.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.400
It's 1-0, Juventus.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.560
Go, Arthur!

17:47.560 --> 17:49.760
And the score is 1-0, Juventus.

17:52.720 --> 17:53.880
Go, Kulu!

17:57.040 --> 17:58.040
McKennie.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.560
Mertens is down.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.480
-Penalty for Napoli.
-Penalty.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.080
Watch out!

18:08.200 --> 18:10.080
The score remains 1-0.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.080
The game can begin again.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.800
Go, pass it!

18:28.760 --> 18:31.280
Napoli goes wide with Politano.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.560
Come on, Berna! Come!

18:32.640 --> 18:35.800
Politano, goes away on the right
watch out, crossing!

18:35.880 --> 18:37.800
He shoots, deflection, Szczęsny!

18:38.240 --> 18:39.280
Szczęsny!

18:39.640 --> 18:41.040
The miracle with feet.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.560
Four minutes of stoppage time gone.

18:47.640 --> 18:51.040
Sixty seconds left till it's game over.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.080
Berna, go!

18:52.160 --> 18:55.400
And it's Juventus with Morata,
Cuadrado has the ball.

18:55.480 --> 18:59.200
Cuadrado aims at the net,
here comes Morata!

18:59.320 --> 19:03.080
Morata!

19:03.200 --> 19:06.280
And Álvaro Morata doubles the score
for Juventus!

19:06.440 --> 19:09.080
And that's the end of the game! Juventus,

19:09.320 --> 19:10.960
for the ninth time,

19:11.200 --> 19:13.080
wins the Italian Super Cup.

19:16.080 --> 19:19.200
The Old Lady raises
the cup to the sky once again.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.320
The boys have won it again.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.000
Olé, olé

19:24.080 --> 19:30.040
Champions, champions
Olé, olé, olé

19:55.320 --> 19:56.480
Did he warn you or not?

19:56.640 --> 19:59.720
-Kulu, get out.
-No!

19:59.800 --> 20:02.880
-Get out. You can't do it.
-Show him how it's done.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.320
Go for it!

20:07.520 --> 20:09.680
Move it, come on!

20:09.800 --> 20:11.960
-Hey!
-Go!

20:23.480 --> 20:25.800
I'll buy you a drink

20:28.080 --> 20:29.520
Thank you!

20:34.760 --> 20:38.040
Charter train reserved
for the first team and staff.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.560
All present underwent FIGC Covid protocol.

20:40.680 --> 20:44.280
This is one of the most beautiful cups
that we have ever won.

20:44.440 --> 20:47.160
One of the most beautiful so far.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.040
Everything is new, everything's changed,

20:52.320 --> 20:54.800
new players, everything's rejuvenated.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.520
They won on their first shot.
They did a great job.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.240
I'm happy. For the hard times,
for everything.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.640
The young ones were happy, Kulu, Chiesa...

21:05.720 --> 21:08.440
Of course,
getting used to winning right away...

21:08.520 --> 21:11.320
They know how it feels to win and lose.

21:11.560 --> 21:14.440
-Exactly.
-It's a big difference.

21:14.960 --> 21:19.560
I approached Cristiano
at the end of the game to thank him

21:19.680 --> 21:22.720
for winning me another cup.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.040
Really, every time.

21:24.080 --> 21:27.280
He said, "Out of 22 finals,

21:27.640 --> 21:31.080
"I've only lost four.
I've won five Champions,

21:32.160 --> 21:33.560
"a thousand Golden Balls."

21:36.080 --> 21:37.080
To the coach!

21:37.480 --> 21:39.720
Congratulations, guys.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.080
Awesome, Coach!

21:44.880 --> 21:49.760
After last night's festivities,
not everyone is at work this morning.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.720
-Have you seen Coach Pirlo?
-No.

21:59.320 --> 22:02.920
He plays it cool at night,
"If you don't drink, we won't win."

22:03.000 --> 22:05.240
-Where is he? Still in his room?
-Yes.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.200
-No way.
-Still no sign of him.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.160
We're all here waiting for him.

22:10.320 --> 22:12.200
-Good morning.
-Look who's here.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.720
-Oh, Coach!
-We've been waiting for you.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.040
What are you doing here?

22:16.120 --> 22:20.080
We've been in the gym and here
since 9:30, waiting for you.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.400
The confidence gained
from winning the Super Cup

22:26.480 --> 22:30.280
pushes Juventus to three victories
in championship and Italian Cup.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.760
Arthur, shoots, goal!

22:32.960 --> 22:36.720
Juventus takes the lead,
Arthur at the 15th minute.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.960
McKennie can do no wrong.

22:43.080 --> 22:46.880
Chiesa, Ronaldo and Morata
are a potent offensive combination.

22:46.960 --> 22:49.840
He raises his head
and catches the ball, Ramsey!

22:49.920 --> 22:53.320
And Morata scores the first
of four goals against Spal,

22:53.400 --> 22:56.200
taking Juventus
into the Italian Cup semifinals.

22:56.280 --> 22:57.840
Go!

22:59.960 --> 23:00.840
Chiesa!

23:01.640 --> 23:02.760
Chiesa!

23:07.920 --> 23:09.600
In the Italian Cup semifinals,

23:09.680 --> 23:13.080
Juventus faces Conte's Inter again.

23:13.760 --> 23:17.680
For Pirlo, this is an opportunity
for revenge on his friend and mentor.

23:18.720 --> 23:22.040
But Juventus may have to play
without Chiellini,

23:22.120 --> 23:24.480
who is once again stuck
with a muscle injury.

23:24.560 --> 23:27.520
I ran another 10, 15 minutes
without discomfort.

23:28.280 --> 23:31.120
In the middle of the field,
he gave me the ball,

23:31.200 --> 23:32.960
I do this,

23:33.040 --> 23:37.640
I feel a contraction,
a strong stretching of the entire calf.

23:39.280 --> 23:41.840
Chiellini, being an optimist, wants to do

23:42.640 --> 23:45.440
a lot more things,
but we try to be careful

23:45.560 --> 23:48.720
about what is really necessary
for him to do.

23:49.880 --> 23:52.080
I only played a game and a half.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.360
So, Leo had to play

23:54.840 --> 23:57.160
more than he should have.

23:59.080 --> 24:00.280
Bonucci and I...

24:01.000 --> 24:02.400
We did an MRI.

24:03.680 --> 24:06.720
Around the scar there is some edema.

24:06.800 --> 24:09.360
We have to be careful.

24:13.640 --> 24:15.880
With Chiellini and Bonucci injured,

24:15.960 --> 24:19.720
Pirlo thinks the solution for defense
is the centerback de Ligt,

24:19.800 --> 24:22.240
who has just finished
a long rehabilitation.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.520
A champion at 20, looks like he's 30.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.560
I think he's the best investment
Juventus has made.

24:29.640 --> 24:32.840
TURIN
JULY 18, 2019

24:32.920 --> 24:37.200
De Ligt was only 19
when Ajax sold him to Juventus

24:37.280 --> 24:40.360
for the staggering sum
of 75 million euros.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.880
He's a special person.

24:44.960 --> 24:46.440
A remarkable guy.

24:46.760 --> 24:49.120
He has all the makings of a champion.

24:50.080 --> 24:50.920
Five.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.320
Unfortunately, his first season
didn't go as planned.

25:02.800 --> 25:03.640
DEFENDER

25:14.440 --> 25:16.240
After surgery to his shoulder,

25:16.320 --> 25:19.360
the player underwent
a long rehabilitation.

25:37.520 --> 25:40.480
Pirlo will have to decide
whether to field him versus Inter

25:40.560 --> 25:41.840
by evaluating his form.

25:46.560 --> 25:50.000
We'll do specific physical work
on Matthijs.

25:50.080 --> 25:51.600
Let's see how he reacts.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.040
If he's okay.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.080
Go!

26:01.440 --> 26:03.640
When he stops and starts again,

26:04.200 --> 26:05.840
he leaves everyone behind.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.120
Watch when he changes. He changes,

26:09.200 --> 26:12.120
the others are still there,
he has already turned.

26:12.760 --> 26:14.280
Like a star player.

26:14.680 --> 26:15.800
He's ready.

26:47.400 --> 26:51.240
MILAN
FEBRUARY 2, 2021

26:59.920 --> 27:02.360
Sixteen days after
the championship challenge,

27:02.440 --> 27:05.800
Juventus returns to San Siro,
on Inter's field.

27:07.920 --> 27:11.160
Again this season,
Pirlo meets his old mentor,

27:11.240 --> 27:12.920
this time in the Italian Cup,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.360
and hopes to surprise him
by changing tactics.

27:20.880 --> 27:22.640
Here we go with Inter-Juventus.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.240
Go, quick, Berna!

27:28.320 --> 27:30.920
Sanchez on Barella, runs to the right.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.520
A cross in the middle by Lautaro Martínez!

27:35.560 --> 27:38.680
Goal, Lautaro Martínez
gives Inter the lead.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.560
There is still plenty of time.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.120
Despite the disadvantage...

27:44.200 --> 27:45.440
All right, come on!

27:45.520 --> 27:48.600
...Juventus shows no signs of yielding.

27:50.240 --> 27:52.520
Alex Sandro, wide ball on the left.

27:53.760 --> 27:55.440
Contact in the penalty area.

27:59.320 --> 28:00.280
It's a penalty.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.200
-Penalty for Juventus.
-Bravo.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.680
Juventus ties!

28:13.480 --> 28:15.640
All right, good, all right!

28:17.280 --> 28:20.920
De Vrij again, goes back to Bastoni,
Handanovič comes out.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
Look out, Ronaldo gets the ball, Ronaldo!

28:26.080 --> 28:29.080
Ball in the net! Juventus takes the lead!

28:29.160 --> 28:30.640
Cristiano Ronaldo!

28:30.720 --> 28:34.360
Taking advantage of a serious error
from Inter's rearguard.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.120
That's the end of the first half.

28:39.480 --> 28:42.960
Juventus will have to defend the 2-1
for another 45 minutes.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.640
They don't have our quality
to get out of it.

28:47.520 --> 28:49.200
The plays are all memorized.

28:49.280 --> 28:52.120
If we block them,
they don't know what to do.

28:53.720 --> 28:57.000
Now, the second half of Inter-Juventus.

28:58.880 --> 29:02.840
More for Sanchez, watch out,
wants to kick, goes wide, Darmian,

29:02.920 --> 29:03.800
he shoots!

29:05.240 --> 29:07.760
Buffon, Buffon's miracle

29:07.840 --> 29:09.840
against Darmian, incredible save.

29:09.920 --> 29:12.160
The amazing Gianluigi Buffon.

29:13.920 --> 29:17.040
And so ends the game.
Juventus wins at San Siro.

29:17.120 --> 29:19.520
Wins 2-1 on Inter's field.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.040
Pirlo gets his victory and revenge.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.280
For the final of the Italian Cup

29:25.360 --> 29:27.200
there is still the second leg,

29:27.280 --> 29:29.840
but Juventus will face it
with an advantage.

29:37.040 --> 29:39.800
Training resumes at the JTC Continassa,

29:39.920 --> 29:41.840
the first team's training center,

29:41.920 --> 29:43.960
in view of the game against Roma.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.800
Carlo Pinsoglio, from Turin,

29:47.920 --> 29:51.000
has been Juventus' third goalkeeper
since 2017.

29:53.360 --> 29:56.200
Although the chances of playing are slim,

29:56.280 --> 29:59.480
Pinsoglio is an important person
in the locker room

29:59.600 --> 30:03.080
because of his drive in training
and in supporting the team.

30:03.800 --> 30:07.120
Beloved by the fans
for his passion for Juventus,

30:07.280 --> 30:10.520
Pinsoglio has also made friends
with Cristiano Ronaldo,

30:10.880 --> 30:12.560
who has a birthday in a few days.

30:12.640 --> 30:13.960
CARLO PINSOGLIO
GOALKEEPER

30:14.040 --> 30:17.680
I'd only ever experienced Cristiano
on television.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.920
When I heard that he was coming
to Juventus,

30:21.120 --> 30:24.760
"Man," I said, "I'm gonna meet
one of the best in the world."

30:25.880 --> 30:29.160
It's great when Cristiano shoots

30:29.280 --> 30:30.600
and you make the save.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.920
It's also personally satisfying.

30:33.600 --> 30:34.680
Come on, Pinso!

30:37.520 --> 30:39.560
Pinsoglio and his girlfriend

30:39.640 --> 30:41.960
are looking for a gift for CR7.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.920
But what do you give to a man
who has everything?

30:45.000 --> 30:48.400
I don't know.
What about a shirt, a sweatshirt?

30:48.480 --> 30:49.880
Maybe a watch.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.040
No?

30:54.280 --> 30:57.040
-He probably has a watch.
-Yes.

30:57.120 --> 31:01.280
We could make a watch
with your face on the dial.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.640
Yeah, sure.

31:03.360 --> 31:07.160
It's not easy finding
a gift for Cristiano.

31:09.760 --> 31:12.720
Why don't we give him 50 cream puffs?

31:14.640 --> 31:16.680
Or a Venetian-style mask.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.600
-With a long beak. Too much?
-No, honey.

31:20.280 --> 31:21.640
That would be nice.

31:22.440 --> 31:23.880
-Hello.
-Hi, guys.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.760
I'd like a hashtag.

31:26.120 --> 31:30.080
"Give a little uh." A particular gift
with a particular phrase.

31:31.160 --> 31:34.320
In the locker room,
I always say, "Give a little uh."

31:34.400 --> 31:37.160
So this thing came out,
then Cris came along

31:37.240 --> 31:39.240
and it rose to world-class status.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.040
-They charge up?
-Gigi, everyone.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.800
-White?
-Yes, white.

31:42.880 --> 31:45.360
With the pig emoticon.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.400
Perfect. The finishing touch.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.320
-Let's go to press.
-Voilà.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.040
Sold.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.680
This year I made a choice.

31:56.840 --> 31:58.680
I chose heart, friendship,

31:59.080 --> 32:00.640
something nice

32:00.880 --> 32:03.000
that maybe he can use everywhere.

32:03.400 --> 32:04.840
Everything is fucked up!

32:06.080 --> 32:07.680
Happy birthday, Cristiano.

32:09.240 --> 32:11.360
Come here for a second?

32:11.520 --> 32:13.360
-Hey, Cris.
-Good morning.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.600
-Happy Birthday.
-Thank you.

32:15.680 --> 32:18.040
Cristianau! Look.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.200
All fucked up!

32:34.760 --> 32:36.200
-Thanks.
-Welcome, bro.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.600
A little something from the heart.

32:39.320 --> 32:42.680
Cristiano is a simple, serene person,
he laughs, he jokes.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.320
You see him on the field
and he seems to...

32:45.400 --> 32:46.720
but he's not that way.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.320
-Happy Birthday.
-Morning.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.280
I was thinking the usual.

32:50.920 --> 32:52.200
Happy Birthday!

32:55.440 --> 32:57.680
After beating Inter in the Italian Cup,

32:57.760 --> 33:01.360
Juventus will play the second leg
championship against Roma.

33:01.600 --> 33:05.280
A win would take the team
from fourth to third in the rankings.

33:06.200 --> 33:08.240
Roma is one of the best teams...

33:09.440 --> 33:11.960
...from an offensive point of view.

33:12.720 --> 33:16.880
For fluidity of play
and offensive solutions,

33:17.240 --> 33:18.920
they probably are the best.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.080
In the first leg game,

33:24.160 --> 33:26.720
Pirlo takes a lesson from Roma...

33:26.800 --> 33:28.640
SEPTEMBER 2020
SERIE A - DAY II

33:28.720 --> 33:31.000
...because he attacks Roma high,

33:31.080 --> 33:34.920
Roma has very good dribblers
to get out of the pressing.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.200
Careful, Juventus is very exposed.

33:37.360 --> 33:42.480
And Juventus finds themselves
repeatedly trapped by Roma's restarts.

33:42.600 --> 33:43.680
It's 2-1 for Roma.

33:44.400 --> 33:45.600
The game ends 2-2.

33:46.080 --> 33:47.680
By the skin of their teeth.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.560
Juventus ties!

33:49.720 --> 33:52.800
But Roma prevailed in that game.

33:57.720 --> 34:00.280
To overcome Roma and get to third place,

34:00.400 --> 34:03.440
Pirlo and his staff must find
a new tactical set-up

34:03.520 --> 34:05.680
to counter Roma's restarts.

34:06.520 --> 34:09.920
We go with Cristiano on the first central.

34:10.040 --> 34:13.320
Shorten with our center backs
on Mkhitaryan.

34:13.680 --> 34:15.880
We'll put Morata in Kulu's place,

34:15.960 --> 34:19.880
McKennie will come inside the field
and helps the midfielders.

34:26.280 --> 34:29.360
Countermeasures,
which at first are theoretical,

34:29.640 --> 34:31.600
must then be tested on the field,

34:31.800 --> 34:34.400
so that the next day in the game

34:34.760 --> 34:37.120
they succeed as effectively as possible.

34:37.880 --> 34:39.120
They are tall.

34:39.360 --> 34:40.680
They're good at headers.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.880
The coach must synthesize
different opinions.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.480
Ball at the first post.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.680
I think it's important

34:48.800 --> 34:52.400
that there are also
different opinions and visions,

34:52.480 --> 34:55.400
so as to enrich the coach's vision,

34:56.120 --> 35:00.160
who then has the burden and honor
of making the final decisions.

35:00.280 --> 35:04.160
Alva, when the ball goes the other way,
go a little inside.

35:04.280 --> 35:08.120
Leave that one uncovered,
but you can help inside the field. Go!

35:11.680 --> 35:13.200
TURIN
FEBRUARY 6, 2021

35:13.320 --> 35:16.360
From the Allianz Stadium,
this is Enrico Zambruno

35:16.480 --> 35:19.880
on day 21 of the Serie A championship,

35:19.960 --> 35:22.640
and this is Juventus versus Roma.

35:23.080 --> 35:27.280
The game analysis team, headed
by Antonio Gagliardi, is in position,

35:27.360 --> 35:29.080
supported by Riccardo Scirea,

35:29.160 --> 35:30.440
game analyst manager.

35:31.040 --> 35:34.880
It will be fundamental to interpret
the match from a tactical point of view

35:34.960 --> 35:37.000
and communicate promptly with the coach,

35:37.080 --> 35:39.000
who will make the final decisions.

35:39.920 --> 35:40.840
Testing.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.080
Yes, I hear you.

35:42.280 --> 35:45.640
All set at Allianz Stadium,
Orsato has the whistle.

35:45.800 --> 35:48.760
This is it, here we go.
It's Juventus-Roma,

35:48.840 --> 35:51.160
day 21 of the championship.

35:51.200 --> 35:54.560
They're defending 5-3-2
with Cristante as second forward.

35:54.960 --> 35:57.520
It looks like Cristante
is playing up front.

35:58.040 --> 36:01.160
Long ball to Veretout,
followed by Bonucci.

36:01.360 --> 36:05.520
He pops in, crosses the ball,
a deflection again by Alex Sandro,

36:05.640 --> 36:07.680
providential action in the game.

36:07.840 --> 36:12.320
They're keeping Villar low
and raising Veretout and Cristante.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.920
Do that with Morata.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.400
It looks like Cristante is playing
from three-quarters with Mkhitaryan.

36:18.480 --> 36:21.600
Veretout gets up there as well.
If he stays on the play...

36:22.280 --> 36:25.160
We can keep Morata on the play, on Villar,

36:25.360 --> 36:27.280
and make the exit we planned.

36:27.800 --> 36:30.120
Alex Sandro runs on the side lane.

36:30.160 --> 36:33.440
Alex Sandro again, no one presses him,
in the penalty area.

36:33.520 --> 36:35.680
Morata, Alex Sandro, personal action,

36:35.800 --> 36:37.640
Alex Sandro, the ball inside,

36:37.920 --> 36:40.960
ball out for Ronaldo, shoots, scores!

36:41.040 --> 36:43.920
Juventus is ahead, Cristiano Ronaldo!

36:44.000 --> 36:46.080
The odds have changed!

36:46.160 --> 36:49.040
Juventus 1, Roma 0.
The king has scored again,

36:49.360 --> 36:50.960
CR7, 1-0.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.520
Roma in the penalty area,

36:53.600 --> 36:55.560
space created by Borja Mayoral.

36:56.640 --> 36:59.320
Second corner kick for Roma.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.360
Alex Sandro takes Cristante.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.480
Alex! Cristante!

37:03.680 --> 37:05.960
Morata stays on Karsdorp.

37:07.080 --> 37:11.160
Veretout, cross in the middle,
header by McKennie, very high.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.120
Roma edging the area, wants a shot.

37:14.160 --> 37:17.200
Ibañez rebounds, Cristante,
ball misses by a hair.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.520
With tactical support from the staff,

37:19.600 --> 37:22.160
Pirlo manages to tame Roma
in the first half

37:22.200 --> 37:25.040
and then seals the game
in the 69th minute.

37:25.120 --> 37:28.280
Opening for Kulusevski,
in the middle, watch out!

37:28.360 --> 37:30.880
Own goal! 2-0 for Juventus!

37:30.960 --> 37:33.920
What an important goal!

37:36.160 --> 37:37.520
And so ends the game.

37:37.600 --> 37:40.040
Juventus beats Roma 2-0.

37:40.440 --> 37:45.600
The three points won against Roma
consolidates Juventus in the rankings

37:45.680 --> 37:47.400
behind Inter and Milan.

37:47.480 --> 37:51.800
Now the team can focus on the second leg
of the Italian Cup against Inter.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.880
TURIN
FEBRUARY 9, 2021

38:00.680 --> 38:04.040
Juventus takes the field
strong from their first-leg win,

38:04.120 --> 38:05.960
and an outcome with no goals

38:06.080 --> 38:08.120
would be enough to pass the leg.

38:08.760 --> 38:12.440
But Pirlo will have to defend against
the attacks of a fierce Inter

38:12.640 --> 38:14.880
that will try to overturn the result.

38:16.840 --> 38:22.000
Don't be surprised by
their aggressiveness. We must be ready.

38:22.520 --> 38:24.520
We need to be stronger.

38:26.840 --> 38:30.000
Guys, one body on the field, all united.

38:30.320 --> 38:32.320
In good times and in bad.

38:33.360 --> 38:36.280
Juventus-Inter, the second leg.

38:36.360 --> 38:37.600
It comes down to this.

38:37.640 --> 38:42.040
Today we will know the first finalist
of the 2020-2021 Italian Cup.

38:43.360 --> 38:44.600
It will be a battle.

38:44.640 --> 38:46.560
Juventus needs to come out strong.

38:46.640 --> 38:51.040
These games are about the details.
We will play it all the way.

38:52.680 --> 38:56.000
A final focus,
some last looks between teammates

38:56.080 --> 38:57.840
before the referee's okay.

39:00.120 --> 39:03.200
This is it, we're off.
Here we go with Juventus-Inter.

39:05.360 --> 39:06.800
Go!

39:12.840 --> 39:14.320
Go for it, guys!

39:14.680 --> 39:19.160
Off Bastoni's chest, CR7 arrives,
slips him the ball,

39:19.200 --> 39:21.760
then Darmian slips on his ankles.

39:25.120 --> 39:26.480
-Yellow!
-Call the foul!

39:26.560 --> 39:28.400
Absolutely untimely entry

39:28.560 --> 39:29.760
on Cristiano Ronaldo.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.440
Yellow card for Darmian.

39:33.000 --> 39:33.920
Go!

39:37.840 --> 39:40.440
Cross into the middle for Lukaku,

39:40.920 --> 39:43.080
-exit of Gianluigi Buffon.
-Go ahead!

39:43.480 --> 39:44.520
Alone!

39:46.480 --> 39:48.960
-Come on, Fede!
-Go, Fede!

39:51.160 --> 39:53.160
Despite a hard-fought start,

39:53.280 --> 39:55.800
they reach the break with no goals scored.

40:02.760 --> 40:04.480
Good, come on, get some rest.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.480
The ball on Lukaku,

40:06.560 --> 40:08.400
you don't have to stick to him.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.400
If you stick to him,
he'll turn and put it in.

40:11.760 --> 40:13.520
Let's keep playing,

40:13.840 --> 40:16.760
carrying better the ball
with the two center backs.

40:16.920 --> 40:18.200
Let's bring it higher.

40:18.400 --> 40:19.920
So here we start playing.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.440
We shoot to get it here.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.400
To resist Inter's forays,

40:24.480 --> 40:27.400
Pirlo modifies his own game plan,

40:27.480 --> 40:30.320
focusing on the defense
in his half of the field.

40:30.400 --> 40:31.480
We can't go back.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.680
Throw it in the middle. Someone will come.

40:34.800 --> 40:38.480
Don't be afraid. Be in control, but play.

40:40.400 --> 40:43.640
And so the second half
of Inter-Juventus begins.

40:47.840 --> 40:49.160
Barella wants to shoot.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.160
Widening. He shoots,
it's over the crossbar.

40:52.280 --> 40:53.520
Hakimi tried.

40:56.280 --> 41:01.160
Ronaldo aims at the goal,
Cristiano Ronaldo, Handanovič saves.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.840
You got it! Here it comes!

41:04.200 --> 41:07.000
Pirlo's intuition turns out
to be a winner.

41:07.080 --> 41:10.160
De Ligt and the defense
have tightened their ranks,

41:10.360 --> 41:12.960
conceding only two shots on goal to Inter.

41:13.160 --> 41:15.640
The Swede is stopped.

41:15.760 --> 41:17.080
The foul is clean.

41:17.160 --> 41:19.600
Buffon out towards Lukaku.

41:19.640 --> 41:22.640
Pirlo's Juventus gives it their all.

41:22.760 --> 41:23.760
Very good, Gio!

41:23.840 --> 41:28.160
A proof of pride
that thwarts Inter's attempts.

41:29.480 --> 41:31.760
Shoots, outside of the net.

41:32.280 --> 41:35.040
Closure again, Buffon holds the ball.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.400
And so ends the game!

41:41.080 --> 41:45.280
Juventus makes it to the final
of the Italian Cup, 0-0 against Inter.

41:46.160 --> 41:48.560
The tie is a loss for Conte.

41:48.640 --> 41:52.880
Pirlo's real victory is in the tactics
he used to overcome his teacher,

41:56.040 --> 41:58.960
leading Juventus
for the second time this season

41:59.040 --> 42:01.400
to the possibility of winning a trophy.

42:05.560 --> 42:07.280
We came together,

42:07.360 --> 42:10.160
understanding that this would be difficult

42:10.280 --> 42:12.800
and we had all to do something more.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.160
The passion for the sport,

42:15.560 --> 42:18.200
the adrenaline rush of victory
is so beautiful

42:18.800 --> 42:22.160
whether you are 15 or 50 years old.

42:38.640 --> 42:40.840
Welcome to the Champions League!

42:46.840 --> 42:50.160
Juventus fans are obsessed
with the Champions League.

42:50.280 --> 42:53.160
We are Juventus
and we have to move forward.

42:53.280 --> 42:56.280
Bravery, guys. Bravery and confidence.
