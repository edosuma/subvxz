00:02.042 --> 00:03.167
NARRATOR: Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.250 --> 00:04.333
FIONA: What is this?

00:04.542 --> 00:06.167
-FIONA: Oh, look at that.
-Oh, my God.

00:06.292 --> 00:08.125
That looks like
the handle of something.

00:08.250 --> 00:10.333
We suspect that
it's from the 1700s.

00:10.542 --> 00:11.833
Even earlier.

00:12.042 --> 00:13.458
-Really?
-JEFF: Absolutely.

00:13.667 --> 00:16.000
MARTY:
We have an opening
into this cavern.

00:16.083 --> 00:19.333
-Yeah. It looks man-made.
-It's amazing.

00:19.542 --> 00:20.500
Okay. Going in.

00:20.667 --> 00:22.125
MARTY: We're all eager to see

00:22.292 --> 00:23.708
-Aladdin's cave.
-ALEX: Stop!

00:23.875 --> 00:25.000
-STEVE: What is that?
-ALEX: Wow.

00:25.167 --> 00:26.542
This is different.

00:26.708 --> 00:27.750
This is way different
than anything we've seen.

00:31.375 --> 00:34.417
NARRATOR:
There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:34.542 --> 00:37.000
where people
have been looking for

00:37.208 --> 00:41.000
an incredible treasure
for more than 200 years.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.042
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.208 --> 00:46.250
with strange symbols
carved into it...

00:47.375 --> 00:50.417
...man-made workings
that date to medieval times,

00:50.583 --> 00:55.000
and a lead cross
whose origin may be connected

00:55.125 --> 00:56.125
to the Knights Templar.

00:56.292 --> 00:59.000
To date, six men have died

00:59.208 --> 01:01.833
trying to solve the mystery.

01:01.958 --> 01:07.000
And according to legend,
one more will have to die

01:07.208 --> 01:09.667
before the treasure
can be found.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.292
♪ ♪

01:21.208 --> 01:22.292
PAUL:
Hey, Steve. Alex.

01:22.375 --> 01:23.792
Everything's
set operating, Paul?

01:23.958 --> 01:25.208
Yep. We just need to attach
the camera

01:25.375 --> 01:27.375
and then we should be
good to go.

01:27.542 --> 01:30.167
NARRATOR:
A new day of fresh excitement
and anticipation

01:30.375 --> 01:32.417
has begun on Oak Island

01:32.583 --> 01:35.500
for brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina and their team.

01:35.708 --> 01:37.292
So I guess we're gonna
get a look down the hole?

01:37.458 --> 01:38.417
Yes, we are.

01:38.625 --> 01:40.833
We'll see what the camera
has to say.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.875
NARRATOR:
They, along with underwater
imaging expert Blaine Carr,

01:45.000 --> 01:46.500
are about to begin

01:46.708 --> 01:49.792
a two-step operation
in the Money Pit area

01:49.875 --> 01:51.792
that they hope will reveal

01:51.958 --> 01:53.333
the answers
that could help solve

01:53.542 --> 01:56.167
a 228-year-old treasure mystery.

01:56.375 --> 02:00.125
So we're gonna enter the cave
today at 140 to 142 feet.

02:00.292 --> 02:02.292
Aladdin's cave,
as you deemed it last year.

02:02.375 --> 02:03.833
So, what do we hope to see

02:04.000 --> 02:04.792
once we get
to the bottom of the hole?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.625
Treasure chests, doubloons.

02:06.833 --> 02:09.167
We want to know
whether this cave is natural

02:09.292 --> 02:11.833
or whether it's been
influenced by people.

02:12.042 --> 02:13.208
RICK: Secondarily to that,

02:13.375 --> 02:15.708
we'd like to see
a way in and a way out.

02:17.375 --> 02:19.292
The primary targets

02:19.458 --> 02:21.500
we were looking for
were tunnels, vaults,

02:21.667 --> 02:23.958
and of course,
any high-density anomalies

02:24.125 --> 02:25.375
that could reflect treasure.

02:26.375 --> 02:28.042
NARRATOR:
One week ago,

02:28.208 --> 02:30.542
representatives
from Ideon Technologies

02:30.708 --> 02:34.167
presented a stunning report
on data that had been collected

02:34.375 --> 02:37.083
deep underground
over the past two years

02:37.292 --> 02:39.167
all across the Money Pit area.

02:39.375 --> 02:41.500
Today what we're gonna be
discussing are results

02:41.708 --> 02:43.708
from the Money Pit
targets of interest.

02:44.750 --> 02:47.000
NARRATOR:
Five devices known
as Muon detectors

02:47.167 --> 02:50.000
had been placed
at various depths

02:50.167 --> 02:52.000
in previously drilled boreholes

02:52.125 --> 02:56.458
to scan for possible voids,
tunnels and large objects.

02:56.667 --> 02:59.417
Incredibly, a number
of potential targets

02:59.542 --> 03:02.333
were identified suggesting
that there could be

03:02.542 --> 03:06.125
multiple treasure deposits
buried in the Money Pit area.

03:07.167 --> 03:12.625
Two were located at depths of
65 and 115 feet respectively,

03:12.792 --> 03:16.542
near the 82-foot-deep
mid-18th century Garden Shaft,

03:16.667 --> 03:19.625
which the team
is currently refurbishing

03:19.792 --> 03:22.667
and deepening
for extensive investigations

03:22.833 --> 03:26.958
with a company named
Dumas Contracting Ltd.

03:27.167 --> 03:28.667
So, this is quite
interesting for us.

03:28.875 --> 03:33.125
This low-density anomaly
perfectly overlaps the void

03:33.250 --> 03:34.958
that you guys call
Aladdin's cave.

03:35.875 --> 03:36.875
NARRATOR:
However,

03:37.042 --> 03:39.000
another compelling target

03:39.167 --> 03:42.708
was identified
several feet to the southwest

03:42.875 --> 03:44.208
within a deep cavity

03:44.375 --> 03:46.792
that was first discovered
one year ago

03:46.958 --> 03:50.167
that has been affectionately
named Aladdin's cave.

03:50.375 --> 03:52.375
It's not some simple cave.

03:52.542 --> 03:54.083
It kind of extends out.

03:54.250 --> 03:56.417
NARRATOR:
A cavity where water testing

03:56.583 --> 04:00.250
has also detected trace evidence
of silver and gold

04:00.417 --> 04:03.417
some 150 feet underground.

04:04.458 --> 04:05.667
The borehole we're gonna
put the camera down

04:05.750 --> 04:07.375
is in borehole L-14,

04:07.542 --> 04:10.375
and L-14 appears
in this cavity or cave

04:10.542 --> 04:12.125
on the southern end
as we know it.

04:12.292 --> 04:15.000
So we're pretty keen on this.
Let's have a look.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.125
All right, so I'm gonna go
open the hole

04:17.292 --> 04:18.250
and I'm gonna start lowering.

04:18.375 --> 04:20.333
Okay. Let's go.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.583
NARRATOR:
Now, after drilling
a new borehole

04:22.792 --> 04:24.333
into Aladdin's cave,

04:24.500 --> 04:27.042
the team will first
investigate it

04:27.208 --> 04:29.000
using a high-definition camera

04:29.167 --> 04:31.208
to look for more
definitive evidence

04:31.375 --> 04:34.000
that it may have been
artificially created,

04:34.167 --> 04:36.292
and also what it might contain.

04:36.458 --> 04:38.083
Okay. Lights are on.

04:38.250 --> 04:39.167
-You good?
-You're good.

04:39.375 --> 04:40.542
Just go for it.

04:40.708 --> 04:42.458
NARRATOR:
If they are successful,

04:42.625 --> 04:46.042
Blaine will then conduct
a comprehensive sonar scan

04:46.250 --> 04:49.500
to create a detailed map
of the feature.

04:49.625 --> 04:51.625
PAUL:
Okay, so, we can see the water.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.583
RICK:
I mean, we're gonna run
the camera down first.

04:53.708 --> 04:58.500
Why not put eyes on that void
and see if we see anything?

04:58.708 --> 05:01.000
Because if we happen to see
a feature down there

05:01.167 --> 05:03.458
that we can orient off
with the camera,

05:03.583 --> 05:05.667
it will be helpful
to the 3D mapping sonar.

05:05.875 --> 05:07.958
We should almost be
to the water by the look of it.

05:08.083 --> 05:09.167
Okay.

05:09.333 --> 05:11.500
-Now you're right there.
-There.

05:11.708 --> 05:13.833
RICK:
So, hopefully,
this photographic imagery

05:14.042 --> 05:16.333
will help us come
to a greater understanding

05:16.500 --> 05:19.333
of what this cave represents.

05:19.542 --> 05:22.000
PAUL:
We're still seeing
the side of the casing

05:22.167 --> 05:23.208
as it's going down.

05:23.375 --> 05:25.125
Where are we at?

05:25.333 --> 05:28.292
PAUL:
Right there, stop.
We're right into it now.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.500
-ALEX: Yep.
-RICK: There.

05:30.667 --> 05:32.208
-PAUL: Right there.
-ALEX: That's the edge
of the casing, I think.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.542
Okay. Rotate around.

05:37.583 --> 05:39.833
ALEX:
Yeah. Those are the teeth,
right there.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.083
MARTY:
You want him
to lower it another foot?

05:43.208 --> 05:45.542
Yeah. Can you go down
another six inches to a foot?

05:47.583 --> 05:50.375
There we go.
A little bit more...

05:50.583 --> 05:52.917
and... stop there.

05:53.917 --> 05:56.417
So this would be
the actual cavity here.

05:56.583 --> 05:58.000
Got to be
a couple feet in by now.

05:58.167 --> 05:59.625
ALEX:
Yep.

05:59.792 --> 06:01.375
Well, there's the wall.
Isn't that the ledge?

06:01.542 --> 06:03.708
-PAUL: Yeah.
-MARTY: It is a ledge.

06:03.875 --> 06:07.000
As we break into the cavity,
we can start to see

06:07.208 --> 06:09.542
the walls,
the sides of this cave.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.500
So I would think there's
something else there,

06:11.708 --> 06:14.333
but that something else
could be covered by silt

06:14.417 --> 06:16.000
and might not be obvious.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.167
I want to get under that ledge.

06:18.333 --> 06:20.000
Okay, Steve, can you really
slowly lower it,

06:20.208 --> 06:22.083
like, three inches.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.000
There you go.

06:26.333 --> 06:27.792
RICK:
It looks like it's open.

06:27.958 --> 06:29.458
-To me.
-BLAINE: Yeah.

06:29.667 --> 06:31.250
Now you have
a much bigger opening.

06:31.417 --> 06:32.958
RICK:
That's good that it's open,

06:33.125 --> 06:36.083
-because that means
we can map it.
-BLAINE: Yeah.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.667
RICK:
The expansiveness
of Aladdin's cave,

06:40.833 --> 06:42.875
it's quite interesting,
very exciting.

06:43.042 --> 06:45.583
We see some features.

06:45.750 --> 06:49.333
It's certainly very plausible
that the camera is not seeing

06:49.542 --> 06:51.750
something which may be
on the floor of the cave.

06:51.917 --> 06:53.667
-Do you want
to lower it down even more?
-MARTY: Yes. Yes.

06:53.875 --> 06:55.583
-ALEX: Yeah.
-We'll see what you can see
on the bottom.

06:55.750 --> 06:57.083
MARTY:
We need to see exactly
where the bottom is,

06:57.250 --> 06:58.125
without any doubt.

06:59.625 --> 07:00.917
Go.

07:01.875 --> 07:03.583
ALEX:
I think we're facing down now.

07:03.750 --> 07:06.083
So, Steve, just very slowly,
another six inches or so.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.875
-Six?
-ALEX: Yep.

07:09.875 --> 07:11.125
That's good.

07:11.208 --> 07:12.917
Little bit more.
Same again, please.

07:14.875 --> 07:16.292
RICK:
There. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.667
Hold up.

07:18.958 --> 07:20.917
Spin around 360.

07:23.708 --> 07:25.667
-There. What's that?
-BLAINE: What's that?

07:25.875 --> 07:27.750
ALEX:
I can't tell if that's...

07:27.917 --> 07:29.417
-the bottom or...
-PAUL: I'll wait
for it to settle out.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.250
ALEX:
There we go. There's something.

07:32.375 --> 07:35.167
Visibility is actually
better than we've seen.

07:35.375 --> 07:37.292
What's this
over here on the right?

07:37.458 --> 07:38.833
Something sticking out.

07:40.250 --> 07:41.125
Right there.

07:41.292 --> 07:43.250
This piece, right in here?

07:43.375 --> 07:45.667
The way the shape is
is kind of angular.

07:45.875 --> 07:47.500
-RICK: That flat thing,
you mean?
-BLAINE: Yeah.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.542
That's a piece of debris
or something.

07:50.625 --> 07:53.333
This is a very exciting thing
and it's important

07:53.542 --> 07:55.542
to see whether
it's man-made or not.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.167
I think there's a chance

07:57.375 --> 07:59.458
the treasure might be
placed there,

07:59.625 --> 08:01.792
which would answer
a lot of questions.

08:02.833 --> 08:04.333
I mean, we're not gonna see
anything more here, are we?

08:04.500 --> 08:05.667
ALEX:
I don't think so.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.667
I think that's all
we're gonna see.

08:07.833 --> 08:10.000
Slowly come out
of the hole now, Steve.

08:10.208 --> 08:11.542
Yes, sir.

08:11.708 --> 08:12.667
RICK:
Bottom line is

08:12.875 --> 08:14.667
this is open enough to map it.

08:14.833 --> 08:17.583
-And that's what's good.
-Yep.

08:17.708 --> 08:19.667
We should be able to find out
if there's anything else

08:19.875 --> 08:21.458
other than just being
a cavity with the sonar.

08:21.583 --> 08:24.250
So, whether there is a tunnel
or some other feature.

08:24.417 --> 08:25.667
Then let's get going
with the sonar, right?

08:25.875 --> 08:27.333
I mean, we've seen
what we need to see here.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.333
Okay. We're gonna get
a scan of that cavity.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.000
-Perfect. Let's go.
-PAUL: Okay.

08:31.083 --> 08:33.000
-MARTY: Let's do this.
-PAUL: Sounds good.

08:34.083 --> 08:36.750
NARRATOR:
While members of the team
make preparations

08:36.917 --> 08:39.750
for the sonar operation
in Aladdin's cave...

08:40.792 --> 08:41.625
-LAIRD: Hello.
-CRAIG: Hello.

08:41.792 --> 08:42.792
RICK: Good morning.

08:42.958 --> 08:43.958
Hi, guys.

08:44.125 --> 08:45.458
What do we have today?

08:45.583 --> 08:48.875
Well, I got the magnetometer
analysis back.

08:49.042 --> 08:50.333
Good.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.583
LAIRD:
Yeah, Saint Mary's University

08:51.708 --> 08:53.083
processed the data for us.

08:53.292 --> 08:54.833
-Yeah.
-Okay. Sounds great.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.750
NARRATOR:
...Rick Lagina
and his business partner

08:56.917 --> 08:58.667
Craig Tester

08:58.833 --> 09:00.583
join archaeologists Laird Niven

09:00.750 --> 09:02.250
and Jamie Kouba

09:02.417 --> 09:04.250
in the Interpretive Centre.

09:04.417 --> 09:05.583
Surprises?

09:05.750 --> 09:06.792
Yes, there are surprises.

09:06.958 --> 09:08.542
-Great.
-(Jamie chuckles)

09:08.708 --> 09:10.125
NARRATOR:
They are about to see a report

09:10.250 --> 09:13.333
regarding an extensive
magnetometry survey

09:13.500 --> 09:15.000
that was recently conducted

09:15.125 --> 09:17.333
around a mysterious
circular stone feature

09:17.542 --> 09:19.083
on Lot 5,

09:19.208 --> 09:23.500
located on the western side
of Oak Island--

09:23.708 --> 09:25.875
a feature which
may have been created

09:26.042 --> 09:28.083
more than a century
before the discovery

09:28.250 --> 09:31.667
of the Money Pit in 1795

09:31.875 --> 09:34.125
and which is also
located in the area

09:34.333 --> 09:35.917
where the team has not only

09:36.125 --> 09:39.083
unearthed a 14th-century
lead barter token,

09:39.250 --> 09:41.708
which may be related
to the lead cross

09:41.875 --> 09:45.292
discovered
at Smith's Cove in 2017,

09:45.458 --> 09:48.333
but also four Roman coins

09:48.500 --> 09:52.542
dating back
as much as 2,000 years.

09:52.750 --> 09:55.667
What we are hoping
to see are walls.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.167
-Mm-hmm.
-Stone features.

09:57.333 --> 09:58.708
-Yeah.
-Even voids.

09:58.875 --> 10:00.917
Okay.

10:01.042 --> 10:03.833
NARRATOR:
Now, after having
the survey data processed

10:04.042 --> 10:06.667
by experts from
the anthropology department

10:06.833 --> 10:08.208
at Saint Mary's University

10:08.417 --> 10:10.167
in Halifax, Nova Scotia,

10:10.375 --> 10:14.333
Laird and Jamie are prepared
to share the results.

10:14.542 --> 10:16.542
So this is what it looks like

10:16.667 --> 10:19.583
on the magnetic susceptibility.

10:19.708 --> 10:23.417
This area right through here
is our around feature.

10:23.542 --> 10:26.417
So if we could
turn this on its side,

10:26.542 --> 10:29.333
it would look like
a big hole, right? Um...

10:30.375 --> 10:32.250
There's your highlight.
That kind of gives you an idea.

10:32.417 --> 10:35.792
So, around it, we're noticing

10:35.958 --> 10:41.125
some rather large features
that actually suggest

10:41.250 --> 10:44.875
that there is
a stone feature underneath it

10:45.042 --> 10:47.792
that is larger
than the round feature.

10:47.917 --> 10:49.167
Oh.

10:49.375 --> 10:52.833
So our feature is actually
much more substantial.

10:55.542 --> 10:56.750
RICK:
Wow.

11:00.875 --> 11:03.583
JAMIE: We're noticing
a stone feature underneath it.

11:03.708 --> 11:06.333
that is larger
than the current feature

11:06.458 --> 11:08.000
that we are aware of.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.125
Wow.

11:09.292 --> 11:10.750
It's quite large, too.

11:10.917 --> 11:12.792
Yeah.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.333
NARRATOR:
In the Oak Island
Interpretive Centre,

11:14.417 --> 11:16.833
archaeologist Jamie Kouba

11:17.042 --> 11:19.667
has just presented
the magnetometry data

11:19.833 --> 11:22.542
suggesting that the potentially

11:22.750 --> 11:26.833
17th to 18th century
circular depression on Lot 5

11:27.042 --> 11:31.583
appears to have a much larger
feature buried beneath it.

11:31.750 --> 11:35.417
So, our feature is actually
much more substantial.

11:35.583 --> 11:37.750
It's a pretty
good size structure.

11:38.708 --> 11:40.000
It's kind of odd.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.667
So I'd really
like to explore that, too.

11:42.875 --> 11:44.167
Yeah. It's-it's exciting.

11:44.375 --> 11:45.250
Great.

11:45.417 --> 11:46.667
When I look at it,

11:46.833 --> 11:48.833
to me, it's quite
daunting because

11:49.042 --> 11:50.875
we're still engaged
in trying to determine

11:51.042 --> 11:53.500
the extent
of the circular feature.

11:53.667 --> 11:56.542
But now we have
a large structure,

11:56.708 --> 11:58.667
which continues to puzzle.

11:58.875 --> 12:02.000
So I think there's a lot of work
that needs to be done

12:02.167 --> 12:05.667
before we can associate
these various structures.

12:05.875 --> 12:07.708
What does that tell you

12:07.875 --> 12:10.167
in terms of why
this one is here?

12:10.333 --> 12:13.083
To me, it suggests
that this wasn't somebody

12:13.208 --> 12:14.792
who was staying there
for a week or two.

12:14.958 --> 12:16.458
They built a structure.

12:16.625 --> 12:18.667
-They lived there.
-LAIRD: Yeah.

12:18.875 --> 12:20.125
That could be separate.

12:20.333 --> 12:21.750
Yes.

12:21.917 --> 12:22.833
Those may be completely
different time periods.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.375
-LAIRD: Yeah.
-JAMIE: Yeah.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.167
Obviously, until we dig,
we don't know what it is.

12:26.333 --> 12:27.792
-Yeah.
-LAIRD: I agree.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.708
I hope we can find some way

12:30.875 --> 12:33.875
to identify a time period
for when whatever that is

12:34.042 --> 12:35.000
-was put in.
-Yeah.

12:35.167 --> 12:36.833
I think that is the key to us

12:37.000 --> 12:39.083
finally solving the mystery,

12:39.208 --> 12:41.833
I feel. (laughs)

12:42.000 --> 12:45.792
I'm dying to answer the question
of "who were these people?"

12:45.958 --> 12:47.625
Yeah, we're dying to answer
the who, what, when,

12:47.792 --> 12:49.500
where, why, and how
on the whole island, right?

12:49.667 --> 12:51.208
-JAIME: Right.
-Yes.

12:51.375 --> 12:52.875
RICK:
That's what we wanted
to do from day one.

12:53.042 --> 12:55.333
Slowly but surely,
I think we're making progress.

12:55.500 --> 12:59.750
The belief that this
was a multi-generational effort

12:59.875 --> 13:02.875
on the part of people--
sure, that's all possible.

13:03.042 --> 13:05.458
Hopefully, there will be
a find that explains

13:05.542 --> 13:08.958
the possible relevance
of Lot 5 to the original work.

13:09.167 --> 13:13.292
There is a very unique story
and maybe multiple stories

13:13.458 --> 13:14.667
now on the island.

13:14.875 --> 13:17.000
-Yeah.
-RICK: And sometimes I think,

13:17.208 --> 13:18.792
"Wow, how can...

13:19.000 --> 13:22.375
how can it be so rich,
so interesting, so compelling?"

13:22.542 --> 13:24.042
Yeah, absolutely.

13:24.208 --> 13:27.000
This is definitely
telling a story.

13:27.125 --> 13:28.833
-Yeah.
-RICK: It's a testament

13:29.042 --> 13:32.750
to all of our beliefs
that something is uniquely here,

13:32.875 --> 13:34.500
meaning story
or treasure or both.

13:34.667 --> 13:36.208
-Yeah.
-JAMIE: Yeah.

13:36.417 --> 13:38.792
Maybe we're on the cusp
of getting some real answers.

13:38.958 --> 13:40.250
-I hope so.
-That would be nice.

13:41.208 --> 13:42.583
-CRAIG: Okay. Appreciate it.
-RICK: Let's go, Craig.

13:42.750 --> 13:43.875
-CRAIG: Talk to you guys later.
-JAMIE: See you guys soon.

13:44.042 --> 13:45.500
RICK:
Thank you.

13:48.042 --> 13:50.250
NARRATOR:
The following morning...

13:51.583 --> 13:52.625
CHARLES:
Hey, Paul.

13:52.792 --> 13:53.958
Hey, Charles.
How's it going?

13:54.125 --> 13:55.208
-Good. How are you?
-All right.

13:55.375 --> 13:56.458
NARRATOR:
...while the team awaits

13:56.583 --> 13:58.292
the return of Blaine Carr

13:58.458 --> 13:59.833
to conduct the sonar scan

14:00.000 --> 14:01.708
of Aladdin's cave,

14:01.917 --> 14:04.500
Charles Barkhouse arrives
in the Money Pit area

14:04.708 --> 14:09.000
for an update on the operation
to deepen the Garden Shaft.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.583
PAUL:
We're assembling the shoe.

14:11.708 --> 14:13.292
CHARLES:
Okay.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.333
So this will be to protect
ourselves from the soil itself.

14:16.542 --> 14:17.500
Okay.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.000
So, you just dig underneath this

14:19.208 --> 14:20.583
and then put another section in?

14:20.750 --> 14:21.417
-Is that how it works?
-Yeah. Yeah.

14:21.583 --> 14:22.667
So this is gonna be

14:22.875 --> 14:24.375
one section of the shoe.

14:24.542 --> 14:26.458
We got five of these piled
one on top of the other.

14:26.583 --> 14:28.292
Oh, okay.

14:28.417 --> 14:31.375
NARRATOR:
After installing
a protective metal frame

14:31.542 --> 14:33.083
known as a shoe

14:33.250 --> 14:36.500
at the bottom of
the 82-foot-deep Garden Shaft,

14:36.708 --> 14:40.208
in the coming weeks,
Dumas will extend the structure

14:40.333 --> 14:44.125
down to a total depth
of some 95 feet,

14:44.292 --> 14:47.750
where the team hopes to breach
a seven-foot-high tunnel

14:47.917 --> 14:50.167
they have encountered
in numerous boreholes

14:50.375 --> 14:53.458
leading to an area
known as the Baby Blob.

14:53.625 --> 14:56.542
It is here where
water testing has detected

14:56.708 --> 15:00.667
the highest trace evidence
of gold, silver and other metals

15:00.833 --> 15:05.250
between depths
of 80 and 120 feet.

15:06.333 --> 15:09.958
How long is it gonna take you
to actually get this down there?

15:10.167 --> 15:12.000
It's gonna take us
maybe a couple hours

15:12.208 --> 15:14.167
once we get everything fitted.

15:14.375 --> 15:16.417
Well, that's-that's
really fantastic.

15:16.542 --> 15:17.750
-Yeah.
-I wish you luck.

15:17.917 --> 15:18.833
-Very good.
-I'll be checking in again.

15:19.042 --> 15:19.875
-Take care.
-Very good.

15:20.042 --> 15:20.833
CHARLES: Carry on, Paul.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.333
PAUL: Yeah. Will do.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.875
NARRATOR:
As the operation continues

15:24.042 --> 15:25.875
in the Garden Shaft...

15:27.833 --> 15:28.708
JACK:
Hey, everybody.

15:28.875 --> 15:30.625
-FIONA: Morning.
-JAMIE: Morning!

15:31.875 --> 15:33.708
So, you guys
just got started back

15:33.875 --> 15:35.333
-on this round feature, right?
-Yeah. Yeah.

15:35.542 --> 15:37.875
NARRATOR:
...Jack Begley joins members

15:38.000 --> 15:41.167
of the archeology team on Lot 5,

15:41.333 --> 15:43.125
where they are meticulously
searching for new clues

15:43.292 --> 15:47.375
within the mysterious
circular stone depression.

15:47.542 --> 15:49.000
In the magnetometer data,

15:49.208 --> 15:51.958
it appeared that there's
a larger rectangular feature

15:52.167 --> 15:54.500
underneath the round feature.

15:54.583 --> 15:56.500
And how is that oriented--
over on this side?

15:56.708 --> 15:57.958
We think that this right here

15:58.125 --> 16:00.333
is the outside
of the wall, so...

16:01.792 --> 16:02.958
It kind of appears that it goes

16:03.125 --> 16:05.167
all the way out
and around, so...

16:05.375 --> 16:07.167
Once we do more work,
we'll be able to see the walls

16:07.292 --> 16:09.250
-more clearly.
-Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

16:09.417 --> 16:11.833
Well, I think
I'll get to screening

16:12.000 --> 16:13.208
and let's figure out

16:13.375 --> 16:14.833
-what's going on here.
-Perfect.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.583
Yay. Thanks.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.208
Take your bucket first, Lindy.

16:20.417 --> 16:22.167
JAMIE:
The round feature is covering up

16:22.375 --> 16:24.542
something that's
a lot larger than we thought.

16:24.708 --> 16:26.833
And so, we're going to see

16:27.042 --> 16:29.833
if we can uncover
the entire thing.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.500
So, in archeology,

16:31.625 --> 16:33.167
we would love to be able
to just tear something apart

16:33.375 --> 16:34.958
with an excavator
to find the answers faster,

16:35.167 --> 16:36.833
but we just can't.
It's very destructive.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.167
So, instead, what we're
gonna do is very careful

16:39.292 --> 16:42.208
and very methodical excavation
of this structure.

16:42.375 --> 16:44.083
FIONA:
There's a couple of bigger
pieces of creamware, Jamie.

16:44.250 --> 16:45.833
-Look at those.
-Oh, nice.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.542
FIONA:
Good sizes.

16:47.750 --> 16:49.417
JAMIE: What we're doing
is we're putting test pits

16:49.583 --> 16:51.583
directly over top of
the feature, and, essentially,

16:51.750 --> 16:54.833
we have a delineated area
that we're excavating

16:55.000 --> 16:56.333
and taking it further
and further out,

16:56.500 --> 16:57.875
and hopefully, find the edges
of this whole thing

16:58.042 --> 16:59.583
and uncover it.

16:59.750 --> 17:00.875
NARRATOR:
As the archaeologists

17:01.042 --> 17:02.833
dig around the stones,

17:02.958 --> 17:05.167
exposing more of the feature

17:05.375 --> 17:08.667
and hopefully the larger
structure beneath it...

17:08.833 --> 17:10.625
All right, time to get dirty.

17:10.750 --> 17:13.333
NARRATOR:
...Jack will carefully
sift through the spoils

17:13.500 --> 17:17.333
in search of artifacts
or clues that may be related

17:17.458 --> 17:20.375
to the 228-year-old mystery.

17:20.542 --> 17:23.167
-Oh, look at that.
-Yes, Jack found those.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.833
-Those are good,
big pieces, too.
-Yeah.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.292
It's gonna be enough for...
to put a vessel together soon.

17:28.417 --> 17:31.083
JACK:
Well, the real stuff
that we're looking for is,

17:31.250 --> 17:34.167
like, at the bottom of this
feature entirely, right?

17:34.375 --> 17:35.875
FIONA:
And we were finding
different ceramics

17:36.042 --> 17:37.667
when we were down
a little deeper, too.

17:37.792 --> 17:39.833
-JACK: Older ceramics.
-MOYA: Yeah.
-FIONA: Yeah.

17:39.958 --> 17:43.083
We haven't even
hit pay dirt yet.

17:44.208 --> 17:45.667
JACK:
There's a lot of work to do

17:45.792 --> 17:47.708
and we really want to try
to find a wall.

17:47.833 --> 17:50.625
Because if there are walls
around this feature,

17:50.792 --> 17:52.667
if they lose artifacts

17:52.833 --> 17:56.333
in the initial construction
of this building,

17:56.500 --> 17:58.125
that can tell us
a beginning date

17:58.250 --> 18:00.500
of when this was
originally built.

18:00.583 --> 18:02.292
♪ ♪

18:03.708 --> 18:05.542
Give it a good shake.

18:10.083 --> 18:11.042
Oh. Oh, wow.

18:11.167 --> 18:12.167
Look at this.

18:12.375 --> 18:14.167
JAMIE:
Oh, my gosh.

18:18.750 --> 18:20.083
JACK:
Oh, wow. Look at this.

18:20.208 --> 18:21.917
Definitely a square fastener.
Like a nail.

18:22.083 --> 18:24.458
Yeah. Absolutely.
Like, hand-cut.

18:24.667 --> 18:27.208
NARRATOR:
While searching
the spoils excavated

18:27.375 --> 18:30.958
from the mysterious stone
feature on Lot 5 on Oak Island,

18:31.042 --> 18:34.667
Jack Begley
and archaeologist Jamie Kouba

18:34.875 --> 18:38.292
have just found
a potentially important clue.

18:38.458 --> 18:40.292
Could that be a rose head?

18:40.458 --> 18:41.917
I kind of wonder if maybe...

18:42.042 --> 18:43.958
Because notice
how much bigger the head is

18:44.167 --> 18:46.208
compared to down here, even.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.208
-It makes me think
it's, like, 1700s.
-JAMIE: Yeah.

18:51.542 --> 18:55.708
I will say, the older the iron,
the more it corrodes outward.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.542
And so I think it's interesting

18:57.750 --> 19:00.625
that there's almost these,
like, bubbles of corrosion.

19:00.750 --> 19:03.708
That kind of tells me
that it could be older.

19:04.667 --> 19:06.375
NARRATOR:
So-called rose head spikes

19:06.583 --> 19:10.000
are hand-forged iron fasteners
with hammered heads

19:10.083 --> 19:12.958
that resemble
the petals of a flower.

19:13.125 --> 19:14.167
Although they were
generally used

19:14.375 --> 19:16.292
in the construction of buildings

19:16.500 --> 19:20.167
and large sailing vessels
as late as the 19th century,

19:20.375 --> 19:23.000
the Oak Island team has found

19:23.208 --> 19:25.583
similar fasteners
in the Money Pit area

19:25.750 --> 19:30.042
that have dated back
to as early as the 17th century.

19:30.208 --> 19:32.333
We have to put it
in the CT scanner.

19:32.542 --> 19:35.167
JAMIE: Yeah, I can't wait
to get it analyzed.

19:35.333 --> 19:36.708
It's definitely
not modern, for sure.

19:36.917 --> 19:38.292
-JACK: Yeah.
-(chuckles)

19:38.417 --> 19:40.208
-I'll get back to sifting.
-JAMIE: All right.

19:40.375 --> 19:42.000
NARRATOR:
Could Jamie Kouba be correct

19:42.125 --> 19:44.500
that this spike
may offer more evidence

19:44.708 --> 19:48.500
that this feature on Lot 5
may have been created

19:48.708 --> 19:52.667
more than a century before
the discovery of the Money Pit?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.333
FIONA:
Okay. What is this? Is this...

19:57.500 --> 19:59.750
Oh, you know what,
I think that's...

19:59.875 --> 20:01.542
That's a big chunk of metal.

20:01.667 --> 20:02.958
-Oh, my God.
-JACK: What is it?

20:03.125 --> 20:05.167
That looks like
the handle of something.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.542
Look at that.
It's beautiful.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.083
What is that?

20:09.250 --> 20:10.792
FIONA:
It's like a tool of some sort.

20:10.958 --> 20:13.167
It's not very heavy.

20:15.167 --> 20:16.583
JAMIE:
That is hollow.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.875
And it's, it's really light.

20:20.042 --> 20:21.250
-Yeah.
-You're right.

20:21.417 --> 20:24.000
JAMIE:
Why is it hollow?
That is bizarre.

20:24.167 --> 20:25.417
Almost feel like there'd be

20:25.625 --> 20:27.167
a piece of wood that'd
be jammed in there.

20:27.375 --> 20:30.042
Like at the end of a tool.

20:30.167 --> 20:31.625
-Like a handle.
-JAMIE: Oh, my God.

20:31.792 --> 20:34.333
Jack, you're brilliant.

20:34.542 --> 20:36.208
They had a wood handle in it.

20:37.208 --> 20:39.333
RICK:
A structure
of this size presents

20:39.500 --> 20:42.583
a possible answer to:
where were the people

20:42.750 --> 20:47.125
associated with the original
construct of the Money Pit?

20:47.333 --> 20:50.083
Let's figure out
what happened there.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.167
But we've got
a lot of work to do.

20:52.292 --> 20:55.542
FIONA:
Let's see if the rest of it's
down, still, in the dirt.

20:55.708 --> 20:57.042
-I'll get back to sifting.
-Okay.

20:57.208 --> 20:58.667
JACK:
Good luck finding more.

20:58.875 --> 21:01.208
NARRATOR:
As Jack and the archaeologists

21:01.375 --> 21:04.000
continue their
investigation on Lot 5...

21:04.208 --> 21:06.292
-PAUL: Hey, Rick, Marty.
-ALEX: Hey.

21:06.458 --> 21:07.958
-So, how are we doing?
-Good.

21:08.125 --> 21:09.917
...Rick and Marty Lagina

21:10.083 --> 21:11.917
join sonar expert Blaine Carr

21:12.083 --> 21:14.000
and other members of the team

21:14.125 --> 21:15.875
in the Money Pit area...

21:16.000 --> 21:18.333
BLAINE:
It's your brand-new,
shiny, 3D sonar.

21:18.542 --> 21:20.167
MARTY:
Ooh, baby!

21:20.333 --> 21:23.125
NARRATOR: After obtaining
video one day ago

21:23.333 --> 21:25.125
of possible man-made workings

21:25.333 --> 21:27.917
some 150 feet underground

21:28.125 --> 21:31.375
in a large cavern
known as Aladdin's cave...

21:31.542 --> 21:32.792
We can tie a rope to it.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.333
Let's do that.

21:34.542 --> 21:35.167
We'll start putting it
down the hole that way.

21:35.375 --> 21:36.708
Yeah.

21:36.917 --> 21:37.833
NARRATOR:
...they are now scanning it

21:38.042 --> 21:39.500
with a sonar device

21:39.708 --> 21:42.625
in order to determine
its exact dimensions

21:42.833 --> 21:45.375
and to also see
if there are tunnels

21:45.542 --> 21:47.167
leading into the feature.

21:47.333 --> 21:50.000
Okay, Scott. Good.

21:50.167 --> 21:51.708
Okay. Going in.

21:52.958 --> 21:56.667
NARRATOR:
The Echologger
DASS710 sonar device

21:56.833 --> 21:59.708
emits high-intensity
radar pulses

21:59.875 --> 22:02.917
that reflect off of objects
and barriers,

22:03.083 --> 22:04.708
such as the walls of a cavern,

22:04.875 --> 22:07.875
in order to produce
a three-dimensional map

22:08.042 --> 22:09.833
of the underwater environment.

22:11.083 --> 22:13.458
140 feet down hole, right now.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.542
Go on in and let's look at this.

22:19.333 --> 22:21.708
BLAINE:
We've got it in a position
where it's getting returns.

22:21.875 --> 22:23.583
-It's starting to spit out data.
-Oh, yeah. I see it. Yeah.

22:24.708 --> 22:25.750
PAUL:
What we're seeing looks like

22:25.917 --> 22:28.333
the outline or perimeter
of the cavity.

22:28.458 --> 22:29.625
How long will it be
before we have

22:29.792 --> 22:31.917
kind of a picture to look at?

22:32.042 --> 22:34.500
I think what we'll do
is we're gonna let it run

22:34.708 --> 22:36.667
-and we come back
in the morning,
-Okay.

22:36.875 --> 22:38.500
hopefully everything
will be finished

22:38.708 --> 22:40.708
and we're gonna see
up into this cavity.

22:40.833 --> 22:42.500
MARTY:
All will be revealed.

22:42.667 --> 22:44.500
I can wait till tomorrow
to get good data.

22:44.708 --> 22:46.542
Let's let it do its thing.

22:46.708 --> 22:47.917
BLAINE:
Absolutely.

22:48.083 --> 22:49.792
MARTY:
I got dibs on the lamp.

22:49.958 --> 22:51.458
NARRATOR:
While the sonar
operation continues

22:51.625 --> 22:54.042
in Aladdin's cave
on Oak Island...

22:55.333 --> 22:57.500
Right this way.

22:57.625 --> 22:59.583
-Thank you, sir.
-You're welcome.

23:00.542 --> 23:02.208
NARRATOR:
...50 miles northeast

23:02.375 --> 23:04.417
in the city of Dartmouth,
Nova Scotia...

23:04.583 --> 23:06.333
-How are you?
-Not too bad, sir.

23:06.542 --> 23:07.917
-How're you doing today?
-Good.

23:08.083 --> 23:09.833
NARRATOR:
...archaeologist Laird Niven

23:10.000 --> 23:12.500
and Oak Island historian
Doug Crowell

23:12.708 --> 23:14.542
have arrived at Nova Tactical

23:14.750 --> 23:17.833
to meet with
weapons expert Jeff Parker.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.625
We have something we're hoping
you can enlighten us on.

23:20.792 --> 23:22.250
Absolutely.

23:22.417 --> 23:25.667
This is an artifact
found on Lot 5

23:25.833 --> 23:27.750
on Oak Island.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.833
We suspect that it's
a ramrod guide.

23:32.875 --> 23:35.667
Looking at it, your suspicions
would be correct.

23:37.458 --> 23:40.292
That is an unusual find.

23:40.375 --> 23:43.458
NARRATOR:
Three weeks ago,
while investigating the spoils

23:43.542 --> 23:46.208
from the mysterious
feature on Lot 5...

23:46.375 --> 23:48.250
It almost looks like a sight.

23:48.375 --> 23:49.667
NARRATOR:
...the team unearthed

23:49.875 --> 23:51.708
a potentially
ancient ramrod guide

23:51.875 --> 23:54.708
designed
for muzzle-loading firearms.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.500
LAIRD:
It looks like "VIIII."

23:57.708 --> 23:58.875
Yeah.

23:59.042 --> 24:00.750
NARRATOR:
The artifact was inscribed

24:00.917 --> 24:03.833
with Roman numerals
representing the number nine.

24:03.958 --> 24:07.833
However, rather than
the conventional symbols of IX,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.208
the characters were
denoted by a V

24:11.375 --> 24:12.958
followed by four I's.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.875
Curiously,
this is the same style

24:17.042 --> 24:20.167
of Roman numerals that were
discovered on a section

24:20.375 --> 24:22.000
of the so-called
U-shaped structure

24:22.167 --> 24:26.458
that the team unearthed
at Smith's Cove in 2018.

24:28.292 --> 24:31.417
These were predominantly used
to hold the ramrods in place

24:31.583 --> 24:33.667
on either
the muskets themselves...

24:33.875 --> 24:34.958
Right.

24:35.042 --> 24:36.125
...or even on their
smaller counterparts

24:36.292 --> 24:38.000
on flintlock handguns as well.

24:38.208 --> 24:39.792
-Really?
-Yeah.

24:39.958 --> 24:42.125
Just due its overall
size and length,

24:42.292 --> 24:46.250
I can say that it would
be fixed up to a smaller rifle

24:46.417 --> 24:47.833
or one
of the flintlock handguns.

24:48.875 --> 24:52.167
Which is interesting because
a rifle's expected...

24:52.292 --> 24:53.167
-Yes.
-...on an island.

24:53.375 --> 24:54.667
-Yes.
-You know,

24:54.833 --> 24:56.000
for people hunting
and things like that.

24:56.208 --> 24:58.583
-Yep.
-A handgun,
I wouldn't think so much.

24:58.708 --> 25:00.750
Yeah.
Very, very interesting find.

25:00.917 --> 25:03.792
Laird and his team in our lab
have been able to identify

25:04.000 --> 25:05.875
some unique markings
on that particular piece.

25:06.042 --> 25:07.833
LAIRD:
Yeah. It has Roman numerals.

25:08.042 --> 25:11.083
-VIIII.
-Mm.

25:11.208 --> 25:13.583
That's definitely not something
you would typically find.

25:13.792 --> 25:15.292
Especially on a piece like this.

25:15.458 --> 25:17.542
That is something that I,
quite honestly,

25:17.708 --> 25:19.333
have not seen before.

25:19.542 --> 25:21.708
Is there a first used

25:21.875 --> 25:24.417
and last used
for this type of rifle?

25:24.625 --> 25:26.958
We suspect
that it's from the 1700s.

25:27.083 --> 25:28.500
-Even earlier.
-Yeah.

25:28.667 --> 25:31.583
The period date
for this particular artifact

25:31.750 --> 25:34.542
could date anywhere
from the 16th century

25:34.708 --> 25:37.333
all the way up
to about the late 1700s.

25:37.458 --> 25:39.542
-DOUG: Really?
-JEFF: Absolutely.

25:39.708 --> 25:41.625
DOUG:
Wow.

25:45.542 --> 25:47.042
JEFF:
So this would date anywhere

25:47.208 --> 25:48.667
from the 16th century

25:48.833 --> 25:51.292
all the way up to, like,
the late 1700s.

25:52.458 --> 25:54.333
-Really?
-Absolutely.

25:54.542 --> 25:57.333
NARRATOR:
At Nova Tactical
in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia,

25:57.500 --> 26:02.250
firearms expert Jeff Parker
has just given his assessment

26:02.375 --> 26:06.000
that the ramrod guide
that was recently found on Lot 5

26:06.167 --> 26:08.500
could predate the discovery
of the Money Pit

26:08.667 --> 26:11.000
by as much as two centuries.

26:11.125 --> 26:13.833
During the 1800s,
they moved away from muskets

26:14.042 --> 26:16.250
and then when
Winchester Repeating Arms

26:16.417 --> 26:19.917
developed their repeating rifle,
largely, muskets fell off.

26:20.125 --> 26:21.708
You know what
I'm hearing, Laird--

26:21.875 --> 26:23.292
that this particular piece

26:23.417 --> 26:24.708
would fit into
William Phips' time.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.208
Yeah.

26:26.375 --> 26:28.500
NARRATOR:
Nearly two months ago,

26:28.667 --> 26:31.458
members of the team
unearthed an iron latch

26:31.625 --> 26:33.667
in the mysterious
feature on Lot 5

26:33.875 --> 26:36.917
that was designed
for lifting heavy cargo.

26:37.083 --> 26:40.875
Astonishingly,
metallurgical analysis revealed

26:41.042 --> 26:43.000
that it was
a compositional match

26:43.125 --> 26:46.833
to artifacts known to have
belonged to Sir William Phips,

26:47.000 --> 26:50.500
the 17th century
privateer and politician

26:50.625 --> 26:52.000
who is believed by some

26:52.208 --> 26:54.167
to have buried a vast
cache of treasure

26:54.333 --> 26:57.125
on Oak Island in 1687.

26:58.167 --> 27:01.333
Could Doug be correct
that this ramrod guide

27:01.542 --> 27:05.500
could offer further evidence
that this theory is true?

27:05.667 --> 27:08.000
Makes you wonder
how that was lost, eh?

27:08.208 --> 27:10.500
We didn't find the other parts
of the gun, but we found this.

27:10.625 --> 27:11.667
-They might still be out there.
-Yeah.

27:11.833 --> 27:13.833
-Yeah.
-We've got some more work to do.

27:14.042 --> 27:16.083
-(all laughing)
-We do. For sure.

27:16.250 --> 27:18.000
Can't thank you enough
for your time, sir.

27:18.208 --> 27:19.375
It has been my pleasure, guys.
Appreciate you guys coming in.

27:19.542 --> 27:20.833
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

27:21.042 --> 27:22.375
-LAIRD: Excellent.
-DOUG: Take care.

27:22.542 --> 27:23.333
-LAIRD: See you later.
-JEFF: Take care, guys.

27:27.292 --> 27:29.542
NARRATOR:
The following morning...

27:29.750 --> 27:30.917
Well, the rain has set
back in big brother.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.458
Yeah.

27:32.667 --> 27:34.708
At least those guys are
staying nice and dry.

27:34.875 --> 27:36.333
NARRATOR:
... despite the heavy rains

27:36.542 --> 27:38.833
that are once again challenging
the team's efforts...

27:39.042 --> 27:41.667
ALEX:
Hey. Come on in. Take a look.

27:41.833 --> 27:44.167
NARRATOR:
...Rick and Marty Lagina arrive

27:44.375 --> 27:46.833
at the Money Pit for an update

27:47.000 --> 27:48.875
on the ongoing sonar scan
being conducted

27:49.083 --> 27:54.125
more than 150 feet deep
in Aladdin's cave.

27:54.292 --> 27:55.667
What's going on,
what am I looking at?

27:55.833 --> 27:58.083
The sonar,
as far as we can determine,

27:58.250 --> 28:00.792
is sitting a foot, maybe two,
off the bottom.

28:00.958 --> 28:02.458
-Right.
-BLAINE: So what we're seeing

28:02.625 --> 28:05.458
is a pretty solid
wall face over here.

28:05.667 --> 28:08.250
MARTY:
Is there any evidence that this
is natural or man-made?

28:08.417 --> 28:10.833
If you had to guess, right now.

28:11.042 --> 28:13.333
Now, the geologist
might look at this and say,

28:13.500 --> 28:14.500
"Yeah, that's natural erosion."

28:14.708 --> 28:17.375
But that's a flat face.

28:17.583 --> 28:19.750
And there is a distinct
possibility that

28:19.917 --> 28:22.250
that was carved out.

28:23.875 --> 28:26.667
Well, the obvious thing
is this right here.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.458
Doesn't that look
like an entrance?

28:30.833 --> 28:32.125
It's possible
there is an opening there.

28:33.375 --> 28:34.500
You have a flat face

28:34.583 --> 28:37.458
and something
sliding down underneath.

28:37.542 --> 28:39.625
I can't see
where it's sloping into,

28:39.792 --> 28:40.958
so we're gonna
have to look at this

28:41.125 --> 28:42.750
in the software that Paul has.

28:42.917 --> 28:43.958
Well, that's interesting.

28:44.125 --> 28:46.542
All the other so-called cavities

28:46.708 --> 28:49.500
are filled with,
you know, sand and stuff.

28:49.708 --> 28:50.875
-Yep.
-Yeah.

28:51.042 --> 28:53.542
That's a pretty
smoothed out cavity.

28:53.708 --> 28:55.000
This is different.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.417
This is way different
than anything we've seen.

28:56.583 --> 28:58.875
ALEX:
Yep.

28:59.917 --> 29:01.292
RICK:
It's imperative that we let

29:01.417 --> 29:03.083
the sonar map
the entirety of the room.

29:03.292 --> 29:06.750
Our interest is define
the extent of the cavity,

29:06.917 --> 29:08.792
see if there's a way in.

29:08.917 --> 29:12.875
So, we have to be patient
and wait for the data.

29:13.917 --> 29:15.000
MARTY:
Every time we do
anything, I'm hoping

29:15.125 --> 29:16.833
for indices of treasure!

29:17.042 --> 29:18.292
That's why we're here.

29:18.458 --> 29:20.333
What we can see indicates

29:20.542 --> 29:22.333
that it's a wide-open cavity,

29:22.542 --> 29:24.333
so I would think
there's something else there.

29:24.458 --> 29:25.833
Okay.

29:26.042 --> 29:27.833
Let's let this gentleman
finish everything up.

29:28.042 --> 29:29.750
Really, I would like you

29:29.917 --> 29:31.167
to kind of put it all together

29:31.292 --> 29:33.500
and then come to us
with results, please,

29:33.708 --> 29:35.167
and recommendations

29:35.375 --> 29:36.917
-once you have a chance
to digest it all.
-Yep.

29:37.875 --> 29:39.458
MARTY:
All right. Let's go.

29:43.417 --> 29:45.667
NARRATOR: While
the sonar operation continues

29:45.875 --> 29:47.208
in the Money Pit area...

29:47.417 --> 29:48.583
MARTY: Gentlemen.

29:48.750 --> 29:50.792
These are a couple pieces
found on Lot 5.

29:50.958 --> 29:53.500
We're gonna have Emma
bring up the results.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.667
NARRATOR:
...Rick, Marty, Craig

29:55.792 --> 29:57.708
and Peter Fornetti
meet with Laird Niven

29:57.875 --> 30:00.417
and archaeometallurgist
Emma Culligan

30:00.542 --> 30:02.333
in the Interpretive Centre

30:02.500 --> 30:05.208
to review Emma's analysis
of the two artifacts

30:05.375 --> 30:07.167
found one day ago

30:07.292 --> 30:10.583
in the mysterious
stone feature on Lot 5.

30:10.792 --> 30:12.708
Can you bring up
the indeterminate object?

30:12.875 --> 30:14.750
The indeterminate object.

30:14.917 --> 30:16.917
Do you want the CT or the XRF?

30:17.042 --> 30:18.958
-I think CT first.
-EMMA: Okay.

30:19.917 --> 30:20.833
NARRATOR:
Earlier this morning,

30:21.042 --> 30:23.083
Emma processed each artifact

30:23.208 --> 30:26.875
using the SkyScan 1273
CT scanner,

30:27.042 --> 30:30.625
which emits non-destructive
X-ray radiation

30:30.750 --> 30:33.000
that can penetrate
built-up corrosion

30:33.208 --> 30:36.208
in order to reveal
finer details.

30:37.167 --> 30:38.792
She also scanned them

30:38.958 --> 30:41.292
using the X-ray
fluorescence spectrometer,

30:41.458 --> 30:45.750
or XRF device, which can
identify the types of metals

30:45.958 --> 30:49.000
that make up
each objects' composition.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.417
EMMA:
This is the CT.

30:57.625 --> 30:59.375
This is interesting because
it was certainly attached

30:59.583 --> 31:01.542
to something.

31:03.208 --> 31:05.958
-Is that a nail or something?
-Is that a real rivet?

31:06.125 --> 31:09.333
EMMA:
Yeah. So, there's
two holes, at least.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.792
MARTY:
I see what you're saying now.

31:10.958 --> 31:13.625
This would've been attached.

31:13.750 --> 31:15.625
What does the metallurgy say?

31:15.708 --> 31:18.000
EMMA:
It's pretty pure iron.

31:18.208 --> 31:20.542
There's no modern indicators,
so that's a good thing.

31:20.708 --> 31:21.792
No manganese?

31:22.000 --> 31:23.500
No manganese. Okay.

31:23.625 --> 31:24.958
-So it's old.
-EMMA: Yeah.

31:25.125 --> 31:27.250
So, in looking at this
compositional lineup,

31:27.417 --> 31:29.000
it does have a high aluminum
to silicon ratio,

31:29.125 --> 31:32.167
which is a consistent
characteristic I've seen

31:32.375 --> 31:36.083
with late 1600s,
1700s English artifacts.

31:36.208 --> 31:38.458
Is it a match
for the Phips' stuff?

31:38.667 --> 31:39.833
EMMA:
Yes.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.333
It is matching
William Phips' artifacts.

31:44.708 --> 31:45.833
MARTY:
There you have it, guys.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.250
RICK:
Wow. That's exciting.

31:51.458 --> 31:52.833
EMMA: It is matching
William Phips' artifacts

31:53.000 --> 31:55.333
pretty closely.

31:55.458 --> 31:57.458
NARRATOR: In the Oak Island
Interpretive Centre,

31:57.542 --> 32:00.083
archaeometallurgist
Emma Culligan

32:00.250 --> 32:02.167
has just informed the team

32:02.333 --> 32:06.167
that an iron tool handle
found one day ago on Lot 5

32:06.375 --> 32:09.667
is a compositional match
to other artifacts

32:09.875 --> 32:13.125
known to have belonged
to the 17th-century politician

32:13.250 --> 32:16.500
and privateer Sir William Phips.

32:16.708 --> 32:20.042
MARTY:
When you show that sort
of compositional likeness,

32:20.167 --> 32:23.000
are those two likely related?

32:23.167 --> 32:25.208
EMMA:
Yes, there's a possibility.

32:25.375 --> 32:27.917
That is a unique
characteristic that is

32:28.083 --> 32:29.833
tied to William Phips' artifacts

32:30.000 --> 32:33.250
which is, yes, late 1600s, 1700s

32:33.417 --> 32:37.083
-iron from England.
-MARTY: Interesting.

32:37.292 --> 32:40.875
You know, there's no denying
that you have some points

32:41.042 --> 32:43.125
of connective tissue
between the Concepcíon

32:43.292 --> 32:44.458
and the salvage of it

32:44.625 --> 32:46.667
by Sir William Phips
and the island.

32:48.208 --> 32:51.000
We know that Phips found
silver on the Concepcíon,

32:51.167 --> 32:53.167
and I believe
some of the treasure

32:53.333 --> 32:55.917
from the Concepcíon
was secreted to Oak Island.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.083
Very interesting.

32:57.208 --> 32:59.917
NARRATOR:
In 2021,

33:00.083 --> 33:02.167
32nd-degree Freemason
Scott Clarke

33:02.333 --> 33:04.500
presented an incredible theory

33:04.708 --> 33:07.125
regarding Sir William Phips'
possible connection

33:07.292 --> 33:09.208
to the Oak Island mystery.

33:09.375 --> 33:14.167
In 1687, Phips
discovered the wreck of

33:14.375 --> 33:17.500
the Spanish treasure galleon
known as the Concepcíon,

33:17.708 --> 33:19.292
which sank in 1641

33:19.458 --> 33:21.792
off the coast of
the Dominican Republic

33:21.917 --> 33:23.792
with more than 100 tons

33:23.958 --> 33:27.000
of silver, gold and jewels.

33:27.208 --> 33:29.583
Following an initial recovery

33:29.750 --> 33:32.083
of some 34 tons of silver,

33:32.250 --> 33:34.542
Phips, who was knighted
by King James II of England

33:34.708 --> 33:37.167
for his efforts,
was ordered to make

33:37.333 --> 33:39.875
a second salvage
of the wreckage.

33:40.042 --> 33:43.167
In preparation for that mission,

33:43.250 --> 33:46.625
Sir William Phips recruited
Captain Andrew Belcher,

33:46.792 --> 33:48.833
a high-ranking Freemason

33:49.000 --> 33:51.083
who owned property
in Mahone Bay,

33:51.250 --> 33:53.083
where Oak Island is located.

33:53.250 --> 33:56.292
Curiously, after completing

33:56.417 --> 33:58.292
the secondary salvage operation,

33:58.417 --> 34:00.625
Phips and Belcher
returned to England

34:00.792 --> 34:03.458
with only a small fraction
of valuables

34:03.625 --> 34:07.250
compared to the original
recovery from the Concepcíon.

34:07.417 --> 34:08.917
SCOTT:
I strongly believe

34:09.083 --> 34:10.833
that Belcher and his comrades
were actually

34:11.042 --> 34:12.500
transferring treasure
from the Concepcíon

34:12.667 --> 34:14.542
to the Oak Island area.

34:14.708 --> 34:16.083
Wow.

34:16.250 --> 34:17.667
Here's what's interesting,

34:17.875 --> 34:19.292
and really
sort of gratifying about

34:19.458 --> 34:22.208
this potential Phips
connection to this island:

34:22.375 --> 34:24.958
We know he was in these waters.

34:25.125 --> 34:27.250
We know he had treasure.

34:27.417 --> 34:29.083
He had motive and opportunity.

34:29.208 --> 34:32.583
It feels like
a realistic theory to me.

34:33.875 --> 34:36.208
It would be interesting to
see what Carmen says about that.

34:36.417 --> 34:38.708
Yeah, show it to Carmen. Yep.

34:38.875 --> 34:40.333
Okay, what's this other one?

34:40.500 --> 34:42.292
LAIRD:
The other one's
called a fastener.

34:42.458 --> 34:45.667
Again, from the southeast
quadrant of Lot 5,

34:45.875 --> 34:47.292
the circular feature.

34:47.458 --> 34:49.083
It almost looks like it has

34:49.250 --> 34:51.250
some specialized purpose.

34:51.417 --> 34:54.125
-The CT should show us more.
-EMMA: Yeah.

34:56.333 --> 34:57.625
This is the fastener.

34:57.833 --> 34:59.667
You've got the flat head,
and there is tapering

34:59.875 --> 35:02.792
on all sides, so it's
definitely hand-forged.

35:02.958 --> 35:04.000
What's the metallurgy?

35:04.167 --> 35:05.708
No modern indicators.

35:05.875 --> 35:08.750
And then I am seeing a high
aluminum silicon content,

35:08.875 --> 35:11.000
which is what I am seeing

35:11.083 --> 35:14.333
in the artifacts
from William Phips.

35:14.500 --> 35:16.375
It matches our man Phips again.

35:16.583 --> 35:17.667
Yeah.

35:17.792 --> 35:20.292
RICK:
You know, that's
recorded history,

35:20.458 --> 35:22.417
that the majority
of the recoverable

35:22.542 --> 35:24.917
precious metals on
the Concepcíon were silver.

35:25.083 --> 35:27.042
Right? And silver went missing.

35:27.250 --> 35:30.667
We have high silver in the water
here on the Money Pit.

35:30.833 --> 35:32.417
We're making our way towards

35:32.542 --> 35:34.458
connecting Sir Williams Phips
here on Oak Island,

35:34.583 --> 35:38.250
and these stand
representative of that.

35:38.375 --> 35:40.333
NARRATOR:
Could the numerous discoveries

35:40.500 --> 35:42.417
that the team has made on Lot 5

35:42.583 --> 35:44.333
that have been
scientifically matched

35:44.500 --> 35:47.125
to artifacts connected
to Sir William Phips

35:47.250 --> 35:50.125
be related to
the high trace evidence

35:50.292 --> 35:52.542
of precious metals
that have been detected

35:52.708 --> 35:56.583
some 100 feet underground
near the Garden Shaft

35:56.708 --> 35:59.958
or explain the recent
muon tomography scans

36:00.125 --> 36:02.542
along with
the indications of valuables

36:02.708 --> 36:06.500
nearly 150 feet deep
in Aladdin's cave?

36:06.667 --> 36:10.042
MARTY:
We know that Phips
was in these waters.

36:10.208 --> 36:13.000
We know that silver or gold
was missing from the Concepcíon.

36:13.208 --> 36:15.375
You know, to me,
it's starting to look like

36:15.542 --> 36:18.458
Lot 5 was some sort of
staging area for something.

36:18.625 --> 36:20.083
Yeah.

36:20.250 --> 36:22.292
RICK:
It's a very curious observation

36:22.458 --> 36:23.833
backed up by science.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.167
Right now, I don't think

36:26.292 --> 36:28.667
any of us around this table
are gonna say

36:28.875 --> 36:30.958
Sir William Phips was not part
of the Oak Island mystery.

36:31.125 --> 36:32.542
But there's
a lot more work to do

36:32.708 --> 36:35.458
-on the Lot 5 feature.
-Yeah, yeah.

36:35.583 --> 36:37.083
Okay, let's get back out there.

36:37.208 --> 36:38.792
I want to find
the damning thing. The proof.

36:38.917 --> 36:40.250
-Yes.
-Let's go.

36:40.458 --> 36:42.042
-RICK: Thanks, Laird.
-MARTY: Thanks, Emma, as always.

36:42.208 --> 36:43.708
EMMA:
Thank you.

36:45.083 --> 36:47.083
NARRATOR:
The following morning...

36:47.208 --> 36:49.500
-JACK: Hey, Rick.
-MARTY: Hey, Rick.

36:49.667 --> 36:52.083
-Hey, everybody.
-MARTY: All right, today

36:52.208 --> 36:54.333
we get to find out a little
bit more about Aladdin's cave.

36:54.542 --> 36:57.167
NARRATOR:
...Marty Lagina
has gathered the team

36:57.333 --> 36:59.167
in the war room,

36:59.375 --> 37:01.375
with Rick Lagina joining
via video conference,

37:01.542 --> 37:03.958
for a highly anticipated report

37:04.083 --> 37:06.500
from sonar expert Blaine Carr

37:06.708 --> 37:08.667
regarding the mysterious cavern

37:08.875 --> 37:11.208
known as Aladdin's cave.

37:11.375 --> 37:14.417
We're all eager to see
what you've got to show us.

37:14.542 --> 37:16.917
Okay, so, the view
that we're looking at here

37:17.042 --> 37:18.667
is looking straight down.

37:18.875 --> 37:20.375
MARTY:
Okay.

37:20.583 --> 37:22.167
BLAINE:
So, we're gonna
try to just slide it up

37:22.375 --> 37:24.875
into a 3D image.

37:25.042 --> 37:26.958
So, you can see
the yellow-green.

37:27.083 --> 37:28.333
Mm-hmm.

37:28.542 --> 37:30.500
BLAINE:
That's sloping down.

37:30.625 --> 37:32.250
This darker red is the wall

37:32.375 --> 37:34.625
in between us
and the floor of the cavern.

37:34.708 --> 37:36.042
That being said,

37:36.208 --> 37:38.250
we can't see the bottom.

37:38.417 --> 37:41.208
The aspect
of the sonar looking out--

37:41.375 --> 37:42.667
the wall is blocking us

37:42.875 --> 37:44.917
-from seeing any further down.
-Mm-hmm.

37:45.042 --> 37:46.292
What I can see--

37:46.375 --> 37:47.875
see those blue lines
crossing over

37:48.042 --> 37:49.583
what look like two gaps?

37:49.792 --> 37:51.250
-MARTY: Yeah.
-BLAINE: It looks like

37:51.417 --> 37:52.458
an opening right through here.

37:52.667 --> 37:54.833
-MARTY: Really?
-BLAINE: Yeah.

37:55.042 --> 37:56.417
BLAINE:
There may indeed be

37:56.625 --> 37:59.708
an entrance and exit
into this cavern.

38:01.083 --> 38:02.292
MARTY:
That is amazing.

38:06.458 --> 38:08.292
So, there may indeed
be an entrance, exit

38:08.458 --> 38:10.042
into this cavern.

38:10.208 --> 38:11.708
-Oh.
-MARTY: So, perhaps

38:11.875 --> 38:14.750
we have an opening
into this cavern.

38:14.875 --> 38:17.500
-Correct.
-Well, this is all
real interesting.

38:17.667 --> 38:19.208
NARRATOR: In the war room,

38:19.375 --> 38:21.750
underwater imaging
expert Blaine Carr

38:21.958 --> 38:24.708
has just presented
compelling sonar data

38:24.917 --> 38:27.833
revealing a possible
tunnel entrance

38:27.958 --> 38:32.000
some 150 feet deep
in the Money Pit area,

38:32.167 --> 38:34.167
connected to the large cavern

38:34.375 --> 38:36.667
known as Aladdin's cave.

38:36.833 --> 38:40.625
So, I think
you have the potential

38:40.792 --> 38:43.125
for man-made ingress
into a natural

38:43.250 --> 38:45.875
-cavern.
-Right.

38:46.042 --> 38:48.500
What's the size of the cavity?

38:48.667 --> 38:49.667
Without being
able to see the bottom,

38:49.833 --> 38:51.208
I just don't
know the right answer,

38:51.375 --> 38:52.750
because it's on a slope.

38:52.917 --> 38:55.125
So, it varies.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.458
It does slope off
in one direction

38:56.542 --> 38:58.667
about 30 degrees.

38:58.875 --> 39:01.125
Which is why the sonar can't
see to the bottom of that hole.

39:01.292 --> 39:03.292
-Okay.
-MARTY: I was real interested

39:03.458 --> 39:05.333
in what you might see
on the floor.

39:05.417 --> 39:07.000
Well, because
the floor is sloping away,

39:07.167 --> 39:10.167
it's hard to say what may
or may not have been there.

39:10.292 --> 39:11.250
Yeah, sure.

39:11.375 --> 39:12.833
But if anything was gonna

39:13.042 --> 39:14.250
be there, I mean, gravity's
gonna take everything

39:14.417 --> 39:15.542
to the bottom of that slope.

39:15.750 --> 39:17.333
Right. Something
could be buried in there.

39:17.542 --> 39:19.167
For sure.

39:19.333 --> 39:20.333
Maybe the treasure.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.792
I suppose it's quite possible.

39:21.917 --> 39:23.833
RICK:
I'm pleasantly surprised,

39:24.042 --> 39:25.792
that there might be

39:25.958 --> 39:28.500
a way into the cave.

39:28.708 --> 39:30.167
It'd be even more interesting

39:30.333 --> 39:32.583
if we saw some
man-made feature in there.

39:32.750 --> 39:35.708
Perhaps it's buried
in the silts on the floor.

39:35.875 --> 39:37.833
It's an interesting
thing to investigate.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.833
It's something
that makes you go, "Hmm,

39:40.042 --> 39:42.417
-we need to see more of this."
-Yeah.

39:42.583 --> 39:43.750
There's some indication
that the cave

39:43.917 --> 39:46.500
has some things that
aren't natural cave-like.

39:46.667 --> 39:48.875
It could be some
sort of treasure chamber.

39:49.042 --> 39:51.042
That's why we're
spending all this money

39:51.208 --> 39:52.542
and time investigating it.

39:52.708 --> 39:55.333
And it checks
a lot of the boxes.

39:55.500 --> 39:56.833
Let's put it this way:
we can't walk away

39:56.958 --> 39:58.625
from this thing
without knowing what it is.

39:58.833 --> 39:59.875
It's unique.

40:00.042 --> 40:02.750
So, what I would do
at this point,

40:02.917 --> 40:04.667
if we're really interested
in seeing something else,

40:04.833 --> 40:06.833
-Yeah.
-is we would move over

40:07.000 --> 40:10.167
about five, six feet.

40:10.375 --> 40:11.875
-Mm-hmm.
-Put another hole down

40:12.042 --> 40:13.500
so the sonar could now see

40:13.667 --> 40:15.458
back into this area and tell us,

40:15.625 --> 40:18.000
are we indeed
in an isolated cavern

40:18.167 --> 40:19.125
or is there an opening?

40:19.333 --> 40:20.208
-Right.
-BLAINE: And see

40:20.375 --> 40:21.917
if this actually carries on.

40:22.042 --> 40:23.167
Yep.

40:23.333 --> 40:24.500
I would dearly love

40:24.625 --> 40:25.417
to put a hole right there,

40:25.583 --> 40:26.917
but I don't know.

40:27.083 --> 40:29.000
Rick, what do you think?
What do you want to do?

40:29.125 --> 40:31.167
I think you have to
put another hole in

40:31.375 --> 40:32.833
to get a different perspective.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.333
Yep.

40:35.458 --> 40:37.208
But you can't walk away.
You have to exploit it

40:37.375 --> 40:39.458
-as much as we can.
-MARTY: All right.

40:39.667 --> 40:42.125
I think we're all in agreement

40:42.250 --> 40:43.292
as to that particular point.

40:43.458 --> 40:44.750
Let's get some more data.

40:44.917 --> 40:46.167
-Sounds good.
-MARTY: All right.

40:46.375 --> 40:47.875
Back to it. Let's go.

40:48.042 --> 40:49.333
We're gonna find
that treasure.

40:49.542 --> 40:50.792
JACK:
I agree.

40:52.042 --> 40:54.667
NARRATOR:
As another week of
compelling discoveries

40:54.792 --> 40:58.583
and potential revelations
comes to a close

40:58.750 --> 41:02.125
for Rick, Marty and their team,

41:02.333 --> 41:04.125
they may be closer than ever

41:04.292 --> 41:08.375
to finally solving
a 228-year-old mystery.

41:08.542 --> 41:10.625
But as the dig continues

41:10.792 --> 41:12.208
for critical clues,

41:12.375 --> 41:14.792
what might they find?

41:14.958 --> 41:17.958
Priceless religious artifacts?

41:18.125 --> 41:22.042
A vast cache of gold,
silver and jewels?

41:23.250 --> 41:26.667
Or will they discover
that all of the above

41:26.833 --> 41:29.083
have been waiting for centuries

41:29.250 --> 41:33.167
to be recovered from deep below?

41:35.667 --> 41:37.708
Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:37.833 --> 41:39.750
MARTY:
All right. Here we go.
Let's do this.

41:39.917 --> 41:42.417
We're going underground
in the Garden Shaft.

41:42.583 --> 41:44.292
What in the hell
is going on here?

41:44.458 --> 41:46.667
ROGER:
It's crazy. We're
encountering a lot of water.

41:46.875 --> 41:48.250
MARTY:
I don't like
the sound of that.

41:48.417 --> 41:49.583
JAMIE:
Oh, look at this.

41:49.750 --> 41:51.000
JACK:
Oh, wow.

41:51.167 --> 41:53.042
HELEN:
It's pre-Money Pit discovery.

41:53.208 --> 41:55.167
This could have been
used in the Money Pit.

41:55.292 --> 41:56.583
-PAUL: Going in right now.
-RICK: We're gonna run

41:56.792 --> 41:58.292
a camera in Aladdin's cave.

41:58.458 --> 42:00.333
-SCOTT: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-MARTY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

42:00.458 --> 42:01.667
SCOTT:
Oh, my God. Look at that.

42:01.833 --> 42:03.000
MARTY:
It could be man-made.
