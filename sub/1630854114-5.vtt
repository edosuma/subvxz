00:03.003 --> 00:04.395
Previously on
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:04.526 --> 00:07.572
How do you break through
to an executive position?

00:07.703 --> 00:09.052
Oh, it's simple.

00:09.183 --> 00:11.141
I had to be willing to do
whatever it takes.

00:11.272 --> 00:13.796
Do whatever it takes, okay.

00:23.327 --> 00:24.763
Morning, boss.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.592
Hi.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.072
Really, Jared?

00:29.203 --> 00:31.814
You told them I coerced you?You said

00:31.944 --> 00:34.904
to do whatever it takes.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.647
Not to me, to other people.

00:39.735 --> 00:41.084
What are you doing here?

00:41.215 --> 00:43.304
Oh, I just had a free afternoon.

00:43.434 --> 00:46.698
You know,
for the rest of my life.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.439
Are you drunk?Don't worry.

00:48.570 --> 00:49.745
I Ubered.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.051
I may be a sexual predator,

00:51.181 --> 00:53.096
but I am not irresponsible.

00:53.227 --> 00:54.315
Boop.
[laughs]

00:54.445 --> 00:57.144
What are you talking about?[sighs]

00:57.274 --> 00:58.623
I was terminated

00:58.754 --> 01:01.583
for having
inappropriate sexual relations

01:01.713 --> 01:02.888
with a "subordinant."

01:03.019 --> 01:04.847
No...

01:04.977 --> 01:06.631
You'll get through this.

01:06.762 --> 01:09.460
Doesn't feel like it.You will.

01:09.591 --> 01:12.028
And I'll be with you
every step of the way.

01:13.769 --> 01:15.423
I love you, Mom.

01:15.553 --> 01:17.077
I love you, too, sweetie.

01:20.602 --> 01:21.820
So, did you use protection

01:21.951 --> 01:24.127
or am I gonna finally
get that grandbaby?

01:30.220 --> 01:31.352
Hello.Hey, honey.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.267
How did things go at
the hospital today?

01:33.397 --> 01:34.355
It was good.

01:34.485 --> 01:36.400
Only two people died.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.794
Your good days and mine
are different.

01:39.925 --> 01:41.101
Dele and I had a fun day.

01:41.231 --> 01:43.625
What kind of fun day?

01:43.755 --> 01:45.105
I took him for a haircut,

01:45.235 --> 01:47.498
then I played Xbox
while he did homework.

01:47.629 --> 01:49.283
I guess I had a fun day.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.981
E kaale,Mum. Kaale.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.070
What's with the hat?
Show your mom your new haircut.

01:54.201 --> 01:58.205
She just got home.
I don't want to bother her.

01:58.335 --> 01:59.684
What did you do?

01:59.815 --> 02:02.731
I got to say,
it's pretty fly.

02:02.861 --> 02:05.168
You know, that's the same look
everyone gave me

02:05.299 --> 02:07.039
when I said it
at the barber shop.

02:08.432 --> 02:11.957
Dele.
Let me see this fly haircut.

02:15.352 --> 02:16.440
[exclaims softly]

02:16.571 --> 02:18.225
What is this?

02:18.355 --> 02:20.270
Apparently, they're
called twists.

02:20.401 --> 02:22.577
I don't care
what they are called.

02:22.707 --> 02:23.969
You know better.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.536
Take them out.

02:26.581 --> 02:27.669
I don't want to.

02:29.236 --> 02:30.150
Excuse me?

02:31.412 --> 02:34.066
I like them
and I want to keep them.

02:34.197 --> 02:37.287
I did not ask you
what you liked.

02:37.418 --> 02:40.029
This is my house.
Take them out.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.639
No.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.902
Have you lost your mind?!

02:44.033 --> 02:46.427
All right, let's everybody
chill out for a second.

02:46.557 --> 02:47.645
You, go and chill yourself.

02:48.907 --> 02:50.257
Who do you think
you are talking to?

02:50.387 --> 02:51.997
Okay, you're overreacting.

02:52.128 --> 02:54.565
Two other kids at the
barber shop were getting

02:54.696 --> 02:56.176
the exact same cut.

02:56.306 --> 02:58.787
Did these two other children
have foolish stepfathers?

02:58.917 --> 03:00.180
It's a haircut.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.007
Not a face tattoo.

03:02.138 --> 03:03.618
I can't even look
at you anymore.

03:03.748 --> 03:04.967
Go to your room.

03:05.097 --> 03:07.752
Hang on, let's just
take a minute.

03:07.883 --> 03:11.060
There's no problem so big
that we can't talk about.

03:12.583 --> 03:15.195
Maybe there is.
Dele, go to your room.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.938
["Ifanla" by Sola Akingbola
playing]

03:42.091 --> 03:44.398
[phone ringing]

03:45.790 --> 03:48.750
Dele's phone,
his mother is speaking.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.143
Damn, you took
the boy's phone?

03:51.274 --> 03:54.930
No, he will not be studying
with you tonight, Steven.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.932
Erase this number.

03:57.062 --> 03:59.064
Very smart.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.240
"Studying" could be code

04:00.370 --> 04:02.546
for robbing a liquor store.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.244
I should have dragged him
to the bathroom

04:04.374 --> 04:06.202
and combed out his hair myself.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.986
Instead, you let him win,

04:08.117 --> 04:11.294
and now Dele will never
respect your authority again.

04:11.425 --> 04:12.948
He's just pushing the limits.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.906
And it's gonna happen
more and more.

04:15.037 --> 04:16.168
Especially now that

04:16.299 --> 04:17.648
he knows you have gone soft.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.607
Mm-mmm.
I sent him to his room

04:19.737 --> 04:21.609
and I took away
all his video games.

04:21.739 --> 04:23.915
Does he still have a bed?Yes.

04:24.046 --> 04:25.177
Soft.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.616
I think he's been punished
enough for getting a haircut.

04:28.746 --> 04:31.706
Mm-mmm. Dele knows when people
see him with his hair like that,

04:31.836 --> 04:33.142
they will make assumptions.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.449
It'll keep him from
getting into a good school

04:35.579 --> 04:37.407
or getting a decent job.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.279
Eh. That is not entirely true.

04:39.409 --> 04:41.672
He could play a criminal on CSI.[exclaims]

04:41.803 --> 04:43.021
GLORIA:
Are you kidding me?

04:43.152 --> 04:45.372
A hairstyle
makes the boy a criminal?

04:45.502 --> 04:47.287
I did not make the rules.

04:47.417 --> 04:48.940
No, white people did.

04:49.071 --> 04:51.073
But just because
they're the "rules,"

04:51.203 --> 04:53.031
does that mean
we have to play by 'em?

04:54.032 --> 04:54.990
I think so.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.774
You think so?

04:56.905 --> 04:58.907
Soft.

05:03.825 --> 05:05.217
[sighs]

05:05.348 --> 05:07.132
Oh, my God.What?

05:07.263 --> 05:08.830
Everyone on Facebook

05:08.960 --> 05:11.223
found out about me and Jared.

05:11.354 --> 05:14.401
They're calling me
the Toesey Hoesey.

05:14.531 --> 05:15.880
Oh, big deal.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.621
You know what we called
sleeping with a coworker

05:17.752 --> 05:19.101
when I was your age?

05:19.231 --> 05:21.277
What?Sex.

05:21.408 --> 05:24.193
It wasn't even that good.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.065
It's like going to prison
for stealing a Honda Civic.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.241
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.331
Mama's gonna fix everything.

05:31.461 --> 05:33.724
It's gonna be okay.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.987
Nothing will ever
be okay again.

05:36.118 --> 05:39.556
That's the same thing you said
junior year of high school

05:39.687 --> 05:42.080
when you didn't
get cast in Oklahoma!

05:42.211 --> 05:45.606
I practiced so hard.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.218
I know you did, sweetheart.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.394
But that night we ate

05:51.525 --> 05:53.483
an entire pound cake and sang

05:53.614 --> 05:54.963
"People Will Say We're in Love."

05:55.093 --> 05:56.878
And you felt better, didn't you?

05:57.008 --> 05:58.401
I did.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.056
But look at me now.

06:01.186 --> 06:03.537
I'm a total mess.All I see

06:03.667 --> 06:07.671
is my beautiful little girl
with a rat's nest on her head.

06:13.590 --> 06:16.506
That's nice, right?Mm-hmm.

Okay, maybe just let mama sing.

06:43.185 --> 06:45.622
Okay, the router's connected,
the Wi-Fi should be up.

06:45.753 --> 06:48.451
Ah. Hold on.
I will Google a question.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.367
Success. [chuckles]

06:51.498 --> 06:54.065
Brad Pitt is five, 11.

06:54.196 --> 06:57.678
Tunde, it looks as if
the dog is driving the car.

06:57.808 --> 06:59.680
[laughs] That's so funny.[laughs]

06:59.810 --> 07:01.116
Thank you, Bob.

07:01.246 --> 07:02.726
All right, you guys
have a fun night.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.119
Would you like
to stay for dinner?

07:04.249 --> 07:06.817
Or perhaps until Dele
graduates from high school?

07:08.079 --> 07:10.952
You guys hear everything
that goes on in our house?

07:11.082 --> 07:13.041
You live with Abishola's mother.

07:13.171 --> 07:14.825
So, yes.

07:14.956 --> 07:17.437
Here is a picture of you
sleeping on the couch.

07:17.567 --> 07:21.049
I'm not wrong in how
I handled Dele's haircut.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.486
If you're going to insist
on having opinions,

07:23.617 --> 07:25.749
I suggest you buy
an air mattress.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.796
I get that I don't
have the life experience

07:28.926 --> 07:30.493
to deal with raising
a young Black man,

07:30.624 --> 07:33.017
but I do know some stuff
that could be helpful.

07:33.148 --> 07:34.758
What stuff?

07:35.933 --> 07:38.022
Well, off the top of my head,
I know a haircut

07:38.153 --> 07:40.460
is a way of expressing
a person's individuality,

07:40.590 --> 07:42.070
and that should be encouraged.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.640
All right, what's for dinner?

07:50.557 --> 07:52.994
[knocking]Hey.

07:53.124 --> 07:54.517
I went ahead
and booked us a spot

07:54.648 --> 07:56.084
for the trade show in Chicago.

07:56.214 --> 07:56.867
Wonderful.

07:56.998 --> 07:58.042
Who should we send?

07:58.173 --> 08:00.001
I was thinking Christina.Wait.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.611
Christina does not work here.

08:01.742 --> 08:05.136
I know. I'm gonna
throw her a lifeline.Wait.

08:05.267 --> 08:07.138
You cannot make a decision
like that on your own.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.053
You got a problem
with me helping my daughter?

08:09.184 --> 08:11.142
Oh, no, I love
nepotism.

08:11.273 --> 08:14.058
One day, this building
will be filled with Olayiwolas.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.495
Well, then what's the big deal?

08:15.625 --> 08:17.235
According to the company bylaws,

08:17.366 --> 08:19.455
the addition
of any executive salaries

08:19.586 --> 08:21.283
must go through
the board of directors.

08:21.413 --> 08:24.112
You read the company bylaws?Yes.

08:24.242 --> 08:27.158
It is the MaxDot Magna Carta.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.944
[chuckles softly]
Look, when you run a business,

08:30.074 --> 08:31.641
you don't always
do everything by the book.

08:31.772 --> 08:33.034
Then why write the book?

08:33.164 --> 08:34.731
Because the lawyers
said we had to.

08:34.862 --> 08:36.994
Let me give you an example.

08:37.125 --> 08:39.431
Let's say you run a factory

08:39.562 --> 08:41.695
and the wiring isn't up to code.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.261
Is our wiring not up to code?

08:43.392 --> 08:44.959
Don't interrupt.

08:45.089 --> 08:47.352
Now, you know
the compliance officer

08:47.483 --> 08:51.139
who's inspecting your factory
is a real big football fan.

08:51.269 --> 08:52.619
Would you spend

08:52.749 --> 08:55.360
half a million dollars
rewiring your factory

08:55.491 --> 08:58.842
or a couple of grand
on Lions season tickets?

08:58.973 --> 09:03.891
Bringing the factory up to code
is a better long-term decision.

09:04.021 --> 09:06.894
It's like you're so smart
it makes you dumb.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.813
[knocking]Come in.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.510
You got a minute?

09:14.641 --> 09:16.338
I've got a month.

09:17.382 --> 09:19.123
I just want to be clear
about something.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.082
You knew your mom
was gonna go nuclear

09:21.212 --> 09:22.562
when she saw your hair.

09:22.692 --> 09:23.475
I did.And you didn't think

09:23.606 --> 09:24.868
to give me a heads-up?

09:24.999 --> 09:26.522
I was standing there clueless.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.481
I used the word "fly."

09:29.612 --> 09:32.049
She's not mad at you.
She's mad at me.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.356
Did you not see me
on the couch last night?

09:34.486 --> 09:36.880
But I don't care about that.

09:37.011 --> 09:39.143
If I had known,
I could have helped.

09:39.274 --> 09:40.362
How?

09:40.492 --> 09:42.277
I don't know.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.845
Tell her you're quitting school
to join the circus.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.673
She freaks out,
I say, "Just kidding,"

09:46.803 --> 09:48.631
thenyou take your hat off

09:48.762 --> 09:50.851
and suddenly
your hair's not so bad.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.983
That's a terrible plan.

09:53.114 --> 09:56.204
Is it? We'll never know.

09:57.509 --> 09:58.554
I'm just saying,

09:58.685 --> 10:01.165
I got your back if you let me.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.341
It's good to know.[door closes in distance]

10:03.472 --> 10:05.474
Okay, I hear the front door,
which means your mother's home,

10:05.605 --> 10:06.649
so I'm gonna go.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.043
This conversation
never happened.

10:12.394 --> 10:13.874
[mutters]

10:22.839 --> 10:25.407
I know it feels
strange to be back,

10:25.537 --> 10:26.626
but it'll all work out.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.149
I'll see to it.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.673
Thanks, Mom.

10:30.804 --> 10:31.979
You don't have to thank me.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.720
We were roommates, remember?

10:35.025 --> 10:37.288
I wish I was in there now.

10:37.419 --> 10:39.421
Don't make it weird, honey.

10:39.551 --> 10:40.640
And you wait right here.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.380
I'll be right back.Okay.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.078
Try not to sleep with
any employees while I'm gone.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.167
Mom!

10:46.297 --> 10:48.256
We have to be able to make
a joke about it, Christina.

10:48.386 --> 10:50.867
No we don't.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.828
Bobby, it's good to see you
back in the building.

10:54.958 --> 10:57.482
MaxDot CEO in the house.

10:57.613 --> 10:58.919
Kofo, question for you.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.529
You ever think about
doing your hair up

11:00.660 --> 11:01.965
in those little twists?

11:02.096 --> 11:04.576
Are you trying to get me killed?

11:04.707 --> 11:06.274
Enough of the chitchat.

11:06.404 --> 11:09.059
Yes, Mr. Olayiwola.

11:09.190 --> 11:11.279
We have called the board
together to discuss

11:11.409 --> 11:14.064
the addition of an employee
at the executive level.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.240
You mean my desperate sister.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.155
In order to maintain
objectivity,

11:18.286 --> 11:21.419
I suggest we only refer to
this person as the applicant.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.595
The desperate applicant.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.423
Bobby, can you believe
this guy read the bylaws?

11:25.554 --> 11:26.947
We have bylaws?

11:27.077 --> 11:28.513
DOTTIE:
All right,

11:28.644 --> 11:29.993
let's do your
precious vote.

11:30.124 --> 11:31.386
I'll start with yes.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.344
Boys, raise your hands.The voting comes

11:33.475 --> 11:35.607
after the discussion stage.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.044
Oh, for crying out loud.

11:37.174 --> 11:39.568
Does anyone have thoughts
on this matter?

11:39.699 --> 11:41.309
I'm just wondering,

11:41.439 --> 11:43.877
Christina's in kind of a fragile
mental state right now.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.879
Is coming back here
really best for her?

11:46.009 --> 11:48.708
Good question. Yes.
Hands up.

11:48.838 --> 11:51.972
We cannot legally discuss
a person's mental state

11:52.102 --> 11:54.365
while considering them
for a job.

11:54.496 --> 11:55.715
There you go, Bobby.

11:55.845 --> 11:57.281
You can't talk about
how crazy she is.

11:57.412 --> 11:59.153
I don't know
how I feel about this either.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.894
Oh, shut up.

12:01.024 --> 12:03.331
It's not fair.
I've been working my ass off,

12:03.461 --> 12:05.507
and she gets to bail
on the family company

12:05.637 --> 12:06.508
and come back
and be my boss again?

12:06.638 --> 12:09.685
Boo-hoo.
Life ain't fair.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.252
Douglas makes a good point.

12:11.382 --> 12:14.821
This decision could
impact employee morale.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.997
Not to mention her morale.
Maybe she's better off

12:17.127 --> 12:19.173
taking some time
to figure things out.

12:19.303 --> 12:21.218
Oh, go sit in your boat.

12:21.349 --> 12:24.178
Let us try to stay on track.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.658
I would like to
say something.Yes, Kofo, go ahead.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.922
If Christina comes back
and takes my job,

12:29.052 --> 12:32.012
I will sue every member
of this board.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.495
Yeah, it didn't work out.

12:42.544 --> 12:44.720
Smells great, buddy.

12:46.156 --> 12:47.331
Ah-ah.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.464
What are you doing
out of your room?

12:49.594 --> 12:51.031
Uh, that's on me.

12:51.161 --> 12:52.075
I thought Dele making
dinner for the family

12:52.206 --> 12:53.685
would be a nice way
to apologize.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.992
If he wanted to apologize,

12:56.123 --> 12:58.429
he would not be standing here
looking like...

12:58.560 --> 13:00.127
Snoop Doggy.

13:00.257 --> 13:01.345
Go to your room.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.521
I told you.

13:05.697 --> 13:08.004
Come on, dinner's gonna be ready
in, like, five minutes.

13:08.135 --> 13:11.268
Then in five minutes
he will eat in his room.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.662
Don't you think there's
a better way to handle this?

13:13.793 --> 13:16.447
You are right.
We will shave his head.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.319
What?
That's crazy.

13:18.449 --> 13:19.973
Is it?
Abishola,

13:20.103 --> 13:21.104
do you remember
when you came home

13:21.235 --> 13:23.803
with all those
terrible ear piercings?

13:23.933 --> 13:25.543
Yes, Mummy.And what did I do?

13:25.674 --> 13:27.415
You destroyed my jewelry

13:27.545 --> 13:29.983
and kept me in the house
until all the holes closed up.

13:30.113 --> 13:32.637
And you never did
it again, did you?

13:32.768 --> 13:34.465
ABISHOLA: No, Mummy.Mm.

13:34.596 --> 13:37.077
Didn't you guys have a rough
patch where you didn't speak?

13:37.207 --> 13:39.688
It was six years.

13:40.689 --> 13:43.300
Well, is that the relationship
you want for you and your son?

13:43.431 --> 13:46.564
Yes, it is.Excuse me, I'm
talking to my wife.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.697
[music playing on TV][phone vibrates]

13:51.265 --> 13:52.570
Oluwa mi o!

13:52.701 --> 13:54.877
Bob stood up to Ebun.

13:55.008 --> 13:55.965
[clicks tongue]

13:56.096 --> 13:57.837
I'll make up
the couch for him.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.584
I want to talk to you.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.891
I want to talk to you, too.

14:09.022 --> 14:10.806
You've told me
how to dress

14:10.937 --> 14:13.069
and how to look my entire life.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.679
I'm 15.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.464
I want to make
my own choices.

14:16.594 --> 14:17.813
Are those clippers?

14:17.944 --> 14:19.597
This is how
your granny suggested

14:19.728 --> 14:21.556
I deal with your haircut.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.952
Did... did you
like her suggestion?

14:26.996 --> 14:28.432
I prefer to handle
things differently.

14:28.563 --> 14:29.564
Sit down.

14:30.913 --> 14:33.742
I want to tell you a story.

14:33.873 --> 14:34.743
Does it have a happy ending?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.963
Shh!

14:37.093 --> 14:39.966
When I was your age,
I also defied my mother.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.228
You did?

14:41.358 --> 14:43.056
One night,

14:43.186 --> 14:45.101
I climbed out
of my bedroom window

14:45.232 --> 14:48.017
and went to a nightclub
on the other side of the city.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.714
Granny must have been
really mad.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.151
She never found out.

14:51.281 --> 14:52.195
[scoffs softly]

14:52.326 --> 14:54.284
And you will never tell her.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.156
Yes, Mum.

14:56.286 --> 14:57.897
While I was there,

14:58.027 --> 15:00.464
someone stole my bag
with all my money.

15:00.595 --> 15:03.728
I was so frightened of the way
my mother would react,

15:03.859 --> 15:05.687
I could not call her for help.

15:05.817 --> 15:08.690
Instead, I took a ride
from a stranger

15:08.820 --> 15:10.822
so I could get home
before she woke up.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.215
So, you got away with it.

15:12.346 --> 15:14.478
That is not the point.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.872
I put myself in danger

15:17.003 --> 15:18.961
because I was
so afraid of my mother.

15:19.092 --> 15:22.530
I never want you to feel
that way about me.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.924
Don't worry.
I'm not afraid of you.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.449
Be a little bit afraid.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.016
Yes, Mum.

15:31.321 --> 15:33.454
Here is your phone.

15:33.584 --> 15:36.152
Come and join us for dinner.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.545
Thank you.

15:40.243 --> 15:41.984
[door closes]

15:44.247 --> 15:45.422
I did it.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.076
I won.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.690
Why are all my contacts deleted?

15:56.781 --> 15:58.392
Last piece of business.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.611
I have decided to send
Douglas and Kofo

16:00.742 --> 16:02.309
to the Chicago trade show.

16:02.439 --> 16:03.875
Thank you for your trust,
Mr. Olayiwola.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.747
Yeah, we won't
let you down.

16:05.877 --> 16:07.270
Remember, these shows are about

16:07.401 --> 16:09.533
creating relationships.
Taking

16:09.664 --> 16:10.795
new clients
out to dinner

16:10.926 --> 16:11.796
and winning them over
with that

16:11.927 --> 16:13.363
MaxDot hospitality.

16:13.494 --> 16:16.236
That used to mean
cocaine and hookers.

16:16.366 --> 16:17.759
Thanks, Mom. Big help.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.543
They called your father
the Snowman.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.154
Okay, enough.

16:21.284 --> 16:23.243
All right,
meeting adjourned.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.636
Just one more
piece of business.

16:25.767 --> 16:29.249
Hey, it's the Toesey Hoesey.

16:29.379 --> 16:32.904
Yes, it is. And yes,
I know I messed up.

16:33.035 --> 16:35.429
First, by leaving
this company.

16:35.559 --> 16:39.433
Then, by succumbing to
my base animal instincts.

16:39.563 --> 16:40.608
Oh, just say sex.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.653
I can call it whatever I want.

16:42.784 --> 16:47.180
But should one mistake
define a person's entire life?

16:47.310 --> 16:49.878
Or should it serve
as an opportunity

16:50.009 --> 16:52.098
for personal growth?

16:52.228 --> 16:55.057
I believe it was
Jesus of Nazareth

16:55.188 --> 16:56.754
who said,"Let he

16:56.885 --> 17:00.454
who is without sin
cast the first stone."

17:00.584 --> 17:04.023
Tell the truth. I'm looking
pretty good right now.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.024
Christina, what do you want?

17:05.154 --> 17:07.548
What any human being wants:

17:07.678 --> 17:08.853
a chance.

17:08.984 --> 17:10.638
A chance at redemption,

17:10.768 --> 17:12.248
at rebirth.

17:12.379 --> 17:15.425
Kofo, Goodwin, you guys
came to this country

17:15.556 --> 17:17.210
for a chance.

17:17.340 --> 17:21.344
It's the central promise
of this nation.

17:21.475 --> 17:24.956
I pledge allegiance
to the flag...

17:25.087 --> 17:26.523
A-All right, pipe down,
Betsy Ross.

17:28.438 --> 17:29.570
What do you think?

17:29.700 --> 17:32.312
Well, we do need a new janitor.

17:32.442 --> 17:35.315
[scoffs]I move we make Christina
the warehouse janitor.

17:35.445 --> 17:36.794
Oh, I second it!

17:36.925 --> 17:37.926
All in favor?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.145
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.

17:39.275 --> 17:40.102
No, no, no, no aye!
No aye.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.713
Meeting adjourned.Welcome back.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.717
Where's your Jesus now, sis?
