<i>Previously on</i> Cloak and Dagger...

00:01.633 --> 00:04.375
<i>I'm not over my dad the
way I wish I was over my dad.</i>

00:04.422 --> 00:06.875
You're afraid if I don't
do everything just right,

00:06.891 --> 00:07.892
you're gonna lose me.

00:07.926 --> 00:10.083
Leaving someone who
hurts you isn't hard.

00:10.108 --> 00:11.275
<i>You just leave.</i>

00:12.558 --> 00:13.865
<i>I have to be perfect.</i>

00:13.898 --> 00:15.234
<i>Like I have to do everything right.</i>

00:15.267 --> 00:17.336
Like I'm trying to
make up for two lives.

00:17.368 --> 00:19.470
You have to refuse to be a victim,

00:19.504 --> 00:21.173
and you have to take away their power.

00:23.074 --> 00:24.909
<i>What were you thinking, Tyrone?</i>

00:24.943 --> 00:26.511
<i>I'm making the city
a better place, O'Reilly.</i>

00:26.543 --> 00:28.881
<i>Tandy, I was in your head.
You have no one.</i>

00:28.913 --> 00:31.031
If you did half the things that she did,

00:31.056 --> 00:32.482
you'd be sitting in a nine-by-nine.

00:32.516 --> 00:33.618
Mom?

00:37.721 --> 00:39.690
<i>- Did everyone just...
- They all just disappeared!</i>

00:39.723 --> 00:41.372

were here, and the next...

03:07.318 --> 03:08.754
What happened?

03:11.863 --> 03:13.090
When I threw my knife, did it...

03:13.124 --> 03:15.284
Kill him? No.

03:18.812 --> 03:20.815
Whatever he was trying to do,

03:20.848 --> 03:23.684
it was enough before
we could do anything.

03:23.717 --> 03:25.353
Sounds like it.

03:27.487 --> 03:28.990
You hear that, too, right?

03:30.760 --> 03:33.563
The trumpet playing on the wind?

03:33.595 --> 03:35.097
That's him. That's Andre.

03:35.131 --> 03:36.316
How do you know?

03:36.340 --> 03:38.528
He used to sit in the center
of that motel,

03:38.567 --> 03:40.917
surrounded by others' despair.

03:40.942 --> 03:42.905
And it was giving him strength,
and he used that strength

03:42.939 --> 03:44.107
to play his horn.

03:44.139 --> 03:46.242
So he's using his horn to
play to a bigger audience.

03:46.274 --> 03:48.243
The city is his motel now.

03:48.276 --> 03:49.845
Maybe even the world.

03:49.879 --> 03:51.982
- Where's he taken them?
- I don't know.

03:53.782 --> 03:56.786
We need to find someone
who can get us the answers.

03:56.811 --> 03:58.108
<i>I'm surprised you came to me.</i>

03:58.202 --> 04:00.255
To be honest, you
don't seem like the type

04:00.303 --> 04:01.757
to ask for help at all.

04:01.791 --> 04:03.560
<i>I'm surprised to be needing it.</i>

04:03.593 --> 04:06.728
But I'm having a bit
of an identity crisis.

04:06.762 --> 04:09.132
See, I smushed my two mouses together.

04:09.157 --> 04:11.058
<i>And oddly, I feel like I know less</i>

04:11.100 --> 04:12.302
<i>about who I'm supposed to be.</i>

04:12.334 --> 04:14.536
<i>If that makes any sense.</i>

04:14.570 --> 04:16.805
Well, let's try to make sense of it.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.608
Oh, and, technically, it's "mice."

04:18.640 --> 04:20.041
How about you?

04:20.075 --> 04:21.577
<i>How about me, what?</i>

04:21.611 --> 04:24.313
You seem like you know
exactly who you are.

04:24.346 --> 04:25.981
Your drive, your purpose.

04:26.014 --> 04:27.550
It's so clear.

04:27.582 --> 04:29.918
Like you've always known
who you were going to be.

04:29.952 --> 04:33.889
My whole life was about
harnessing this special energy.

04:33.923 --> 04:35.725
Maybe I should have been less driven.

04:35.757 --> 04:37.827
Well, why's that?

04:37.860 --> 04:40.330
<i>Well, look what this energy did.</i>

04:40.363 --> 04:43.399
<i>Last year, to the whole city.</i>

04:43.432 --> 04:44.835
<i>To you.</i>

04:46.801 --> 04:48.504
Everyone else seems to
have forgotten about it.

04:49.971 --> 04:51.608
<i>But you didn't.</i>

04:51.640 --> 04:53.942
<i>You're still fighting
it on some level. Why?</i>

04:53.976 --> 04:57.447
It affected me, too, when
that terror touched me.

04:57.479 --> 04:59.414
I lost control.

04:59.447 --> 05:00.950
I lost myself.

05:00.983 --> 05:03.353
<i>And while I know it's not my fault,</i>

05:03.385 --> 05:06.188
<i>it doesn't make things any better.</i>

05:06.221 --> 05:08.690
<i>So, if I can just understand it...</i>

05:08.724 --> 05:10.459
You can control it.

05:12.861 --> 05:13.929
Do you think that's true?

05:13.962 --> 05:16.365
<i>Not in the least.</i>

05:16.399 --> 05:18.000
The only alternative to doing nothing

05:18.034 --> 05:20.002
is doing something, you know?

05:20.036 --> 05:21.637
I do.

05:24.373 --> 05:25.942
So, how's my brain looking?

05:25.974 --> 05:27.976
You get my good side?

05:28.010 --> 05:29.678
<i>I got both sides.</i>

05:29.712 --> 05:32.815
<i>The rage is still there,
and it's prominent.</i>

05:32.848 --> 05:35.074
But it's not the only thing anymore.

05:35.099 --> 05:37.809
<i>There is empathy,</i>

05:38.154 --> 05:40.257
<i>and there is compassion.</i>

05:41.856 --> 05:42.925
Is there love?

05:44.659 --> 05:47.029
<i>Well, we haven't learned to map it yet.</i>

05:47.063 --> 05:50.132
<i>But, like any brain, it can be trained</i>

05:50.166 --> 05:52.868
<i>to make certain parts stronger.</i>

05:52.901 --> 05:53.904
Doctor Hess?

05:55.570 --> 05:56.839
Doctor Hess?

06:11.786 --> 06:13.356
What?

06:13.389 --> 06:15.058
Look, last time we talked,
she made it pretty clear

06:15.091 --> 06:17.260
she didn't want anything to do with me.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.162
Uh, I think she meant romantically.

06:19.195 --> 06:20.863
Well, whatever she meant,

06:20.896 --> 06:23.833
- I feel like I should respect her...
- No.

06:23.865 --> 06:26.736
No, this is not about her.

06:26.769 --> 06:28.772
Or about it being easy for you.

06:29.805 --> 06:32.408
Ty, people are disappearing.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.876
So I'm sorry that your
girl is now your ex,

06:34.909 --> 06:36.067
but she's probably the only one

06:36.092 --> 06:37.780
who can help us sort this crazy out.

06:37.813 --> 06:38.949
Fine.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.746
- Fine, let's just...
- You know this door's made of thin,

06:41.770 --> 06:42.879
wooden slats, right?

06:42.918 --> 06:45.707
I can hear everything
the two of you are saying.

06:50.959 --> 06:52.262
First, we look at the past.

06:56.599 --> 06:58.200
Ancient Loa made rare exceptions

06:58.233 --> 07:00.435
allowing responsible
mortals into their ranks.

07:00.469 --> 07:02.904
Then, the present.

07:02.938 --> 07:05.339
Where, it seems, some force
has been given all of the power

07:05.364 --> 07:06.776
with none of the responsibility.

07:06.808 --> 07:08.243
That would be Andre.

07:08.276 --> 07:10.313
Despair.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.447
It's all I see in his future.

07:12.481 --> 07:14.651
It's all he brings to
everything he touches.

07:14.683 --> 07:16.084
So how do we stop him?

07:16.118 --> 07:18.053
- I can't say.
- Then how do we find him?

07:18.087 --> 07:20.389
You two need to go where most cannot.

07:20.423 --> 07:21.858
Okay...

07:23.192 --> 07:24.194
Where's that?

07:27.962 --> 07:29.931
Uh, is this really necessary?

07:29.964 --> 07:32.635
Knowing Tyrone? Yeah.

07:32.668 --> 07:33.836
What's that supposed to mean?

07:33.868 --> 07:35.904
I need you to open a doorway
and then walk through it.

07:35.938 --> 07:38.341
You've never done that before, have you?

07:38.373 --> 07:40.475
I don't know how good I'm gonna
be in there without my hoodie.

07:40.509 --> 07:42.078
I've just learned to master it.

07:42.111 --> 07:43.980
You're humble as pie, Tyrone.

07:44.012 --> 07:46.181
It's adorable. Most of the time.

07:46.214 --> 07:48.450
But today, it's dangerous.

07:48.483 --> 07:50.919
Okay? Today, we need an emperor,

07:50.952 --> 07:52.621
not the clothes.

07:54.389 --> 07:56.259
Look, I'm all in for pepping up Ty,

07:56.298 --> 07:58.435
but I mean, the only
way that this door opens

07:58.461 --> 07:59.962
is when he's deathly afraid.

07:59.995 --> 08:01.998
Hold on. Don't worry about that.

08:02.031 --> 08:04.300
All those people are missing.

08:04.332 --> 08:05.868
Including your mom.

08:05.901 --> 08:07.770
I've never been more
scared in my damn life.

08:09.839 --> 08:11.507
This doorway's on a timer.

08:13.041 --> 08:14.844
That timer is this one candle.

08:14.877 --> 08:17.880
So as long as it stays
lit and I concentrate,

08:17.913 --> 08:19.049
you can come back.

08:20.048 --> 08:21.216
And if it goes out?

08:23.017 --> 08:25.454
You may be stuck in a
world of despair for good.

08:25.488 --> 08:27.656
You'll keep us safe.

08:27.690 --> 08:29.325
Got you.

08:56.785 --> 08:58.186
- Tandy?
- Yeah.

08:58.220 --> 08:59.689
Where are you?

09:23.745 --> 09:24.947
Hello?

09:27.216 --> 09:28.885
Papa Legba?

09:32.554 --> 09:35.757
I thought you said Andre's
record store was in the mall.

09:35.790 --> 09:37.260
It is.

09:40.629 --> 09:43.566
But if this place is
ripped apart and empty

09:43.598 --> 09:45.767
and this viewfinder is destroyed,

09:45.801 --> 09:48.137
we can't get there.

09:57.533 --> 10:00.102
Come on, come on!

10:00.154 --> 10:01.750
Dammit!

10:01.784 --> 10:03.952
- Tandy, we have to...
- Ty, I can't.

10:03.986 --> 10:05.455
I just can't.

10:05.487 --> 10:07.289
Look, of course you can.

10:07.322 --> 10:09.358
We can. Right?

10:11.092 --> 10:12.761
Look, Tandy, your mom is in there,

10:12.794 --> 10:13.981
and so are all those other girls.

10:14.006 --> 10:16.097
I might as well be, too.

10:20.269 --> 10:22.272
They need a hero to save them.

10:23.672 --> 10:26.274
And what if I'm not strong enough?

10:26.308 --> 10:28.111
You know who you sound like?

10:29.778 --> 10:32.182
- A loser.
- You sound like me.

10:35.985 --> 10:40.056
You are the strongest
person I have ever met.

10:41.657 --> 10:45.761
You're Tandy frickin' Bowen, okay?

10:45.793 --> 10:47.763
Master thief.

10:47.795 --> 10:49.364
Kick-ass ballerina.

10:49.398 --> 10:51.534
Manipulator of light.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.168
And harbinger of hope.

10:56.337 --> 10:57.994
We'd be better off if I was a master

10:58.019 --> 10:59.975
of space and time like you are.

11:05.246 --> 11:06.849
Maybe you can be.

11:16.891 --> 11:18.427
Point where you want to go.

11:22.239 --> 11:24.900
Finished the heart, and I'm
almost done with the crosses.

11:24.933 --> 11:28.370
Crosses? Those aren't crosses.

11:28.404 --> 11:30.740
Of course they are.
What else would they be?

11:30.773 --> 11:32.575
Look like daggers to me.

11:33.942 --> 11:35.010
Daggers?

11:36.278 --> 11:38.175
Yeah. Not a knife,

11:38.913 --> 11:40.636
not a sword,

11:40.956 --> 11:42.717
but they can do the job of either.

11:42.750 --> 11:44.666
The special ones?

11:46.020 --> 11:47.856
They're full of pure hope.

11:47.889 --> 11:49.692
The opposite of despair.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.529
What's a more powerful weapon than that?

11:56.097 --> 11:58.700
So, what do I do now?

12:00.468 --> 12:02.213
Just take a breath

12:02.971 --> 12:05.240
and think of where you need to be.

12:05.274 --> 12:06.741
You really believe in that?

12:06.774 --> 12:08.077
I don't need to.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.248
I believe in Tandy Bowen.

12:22.824 --> 12:24.292
Why are you smiling?

12:32.167 --> 12:34.637
Okay, maybe daggers are kind of cool.

12:34.669 --> 12:36.705
- I hate to say I told you so.
- No, you don't.

12:36.739 --> 12:37.507
Yeah. No, I don't.

12:38.606 --> 12:41.977
The windows are broken.

12:42.010 --> 12:44.447
Like somebody was trying to get in.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.215
No...

12:46.284 --> 12:47.819
Not in.

12:48.516 --> 12:50.368
Look at the glass.

12:51.059 --> 12:53.362
Looks like something
was trying to get out.

12:53.395 --> 12:54.963
Out to where?

13:34.213 --> 13:36.471
Has this place always
been such a shithole?

13:36.505 --> 13:37.874
No.

13:37.906 --> 13:39.876
No, it's like he's throwing off

13:39.909 --> 13:42.946
the supernatural order of things.

13:44.579 --> 13:45.948
Which way to the record store?

13:45.981 --> 13:47.950
To the map, then the mirrors,

13:47.982 --> 13:49.819
- then past the...
- Past the what?

13:50.961 --> 13:52.330
Camping store.

14:13.541 --> 14:14.944
I take it the kids aren't home?

14:16.178 --> 14:19.347
Tyrone and Tandy went in the
rabbit hole to stop a god.

14:19.381 --> 14:20.916
Then what was that thing I just threw?

14:20.957 --> 14:23.928
My guess, it's what gods
send to stop people like me.

14:23.953 --> 14:25.554
To blow this candle out.

14:26.322 --> 14:28.090
Why are you here?

14:28.122 --> 14:29.925
I think to protect that candle.

14:29.958 --> 14:32.460
More people are starting to
disappear all over the city.

14:32.493 --> 14:34.696
If Tandy and Tyrone can't stop them...

14:36.531 --> 14:37.934
I don't know if anyone can.

14:37.967 --> 14:39.669
Let's see if we can give them a chance.

14:45.006 --> 14:46.876
What's this all about?

14:46.909 --> 14:48.857
All these versions of you and me.

14:48.882 --> 14:51.046
Possibilities, I guess?

14:52.982 --> 14:55.050
Do what I do.

15:58.948 --> 16:00.216
What is it?

16:01.950 --> 16:05.184
This place used to be filled
to the gills with records.

16:05.209 --> 16:07.812
That's how he collected
everybody's pain.

16:07.894 --> 16:09.696
Where do you think they went?

16:14.161 --> 16:15.830
This way.

16:27.664 --> 16:29.946
He's not collecting records anymore.

16:40.813 --> 16:42.415
He's collecting people.

16:51.197 --> 16:52.399
Mom?

16:54.139 --> 16:56.240
Back in the day, when
we used to play the clubs,

16:56.284 --> 16:58.886
you never knew who would walk in
the door and come and jam with you.

16:58.919 --> 17:01.289
Miss Bowen and Mr. Johnson,

17:01.323 --> 17:03.392
I appreciate your enthusiasm

17:03.424 --> 17:06.094
and your effort to make your way here.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.858
But ain't no geek off the street

17:07.888 --> 17:10.209
can just jump in and
jam with me anymore.

17:21.026 --> 17:22.861
- What did you do to her?
- I sent her back to a conflict

17:22.886 --> 17:25.821
that's a little more her cup of tea.

17:38.409 --> 17:39.744
Ty?

17:41.413 --> 17:42.982
Tyrone, are you there?

17:45.573 --> 17:47.709
Mom?

17:47.741 --> 17:49.911
Mommy's not here right now.

17:51.301 --> 17:52.838
Maybe Daddy can help?

17:54.870 --> 17:56.040
Tandy?

17:59.516 --> 18:00.753
Tandy, are you here?

18:05.740 --> 18:06.942
Where are you?

18:09.941 --> 18:11.043
Mom?

18:12.883 --> 18:13.972
Billy?

18:28.703 --> 18:30.740
Were you expecting someone else?

18:39.461 --> 18:40.662
Is this some kind of joke?

18:40.687 --> 18:43.374
I'm the one looking at a joke, joke.

18:43.407 --> 18:44.943
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

18:46.310 --> 18:48.822
- Where's Andre? Where's Tyrone?
- Who are they?

18:49.439 --> 18:51.475
Are they boyfriends?

18:51.556 --> 18:53.484
Aren't you a little too young to date?

18:55.168 --> 18:56.750
Sweetheart, what's wrong?

18:56.797 --> 18:58.283
Man, what happened to you?

18:58.315 --> 18:59.985
You were supposed to
be better than this.

19:00.017 --> 19:02.219
You had all this potential.

19:02.253 --> 19:03.789
Two loving parents.

19:03.822 --> 19:05.991
An education most people
in this life don't get,

19:06.024 --> 19:08.893
and you threw it all away.

19:08.927 --> 19:10.562
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Like what?

19:10.594 --> 19:11.848
Like I don't know what you did.

19:11.873 --> 19:14.132
You couldn't control yourself.

19:15.799 --> 19:19.904
You couldn't keep your
head down or your pants up.

19:19.938 --> 19:21.907
- You couldn't let it go.
- He killed Billy.

19:21.939 --> 19:24.809
Guess who's still dead.

19:24.843 --> 19:27.446
<i>This is all a big misunderstanding.</i>

19:27.478 --> 19:29.680
There are two sides to every story,

19:29.714 --> 19:34.446
- and I never got a chance to explain.
- Okay, so explain.

19:34.471 --> 19:36.663
Mom already told you there
was no good in harping on it.

19:36.688 --> 19:38.390
But you didn't listen.

19:39.754 --> 19:42.204
And now, for all your efforts,

19:42.649 --> 19:44.096
you're a wanted man.

19:44.142 --> 19:46.533
Yeah, everybody else's fault,

19:46.558 --> 19:47.841
but you couldn't share any blame.

19:47.865 --> 19:49.000
And I'm not buying any of this.

19:49.034 --> 19:52.004
Maybe you should've
been the one who died.

19:53.904 --> 19:55.574
I knew you were gonna do that.

19:56.975 --> 19:58.944
And that too.

20:00.844 --> 20:03.848
Do you think that it's
easy to support a family?

20:03.881 --> 20:05.616
To raise a child?

20:05.650 --> 20:07.319
Billy getting shot
screwed up our family,

20:07.352 --> 20:08.786
but it didn't break it.

20:08.820 --> 20:10.655
The tiny rebellions did.

20:10.688 --> 20:11.790
It also broke her.

20:11.823 --> 20:13.057
<i>I don't think anything's so hard</i>

20:13.091 --> 20:14.892
that you'd have to
raise your hand at mom.

20:14.917 --> 20:15.980
Ever.

20:16.005 --> 20:17.395
- She's a murderer now.
- No.

20:17.429 --> 20:18.909
That shows how much you know.

20:18.934 --> 20:21.427
I know how a man's supposed to act,

20:22.233 --> 20:24.369
and I'm sad I didn't
have one for a father.

20:24.401 --> 20:25.703
She's a murderer now, and

20:25.729 --> 20:27.831
she's not gonna be able to come back...

20:27.872 --> 20:29.941
You ungrateful...

20:31.117 --> 20:34.445
You can't hurt me, pumpkin.
I'm already dead.

20:34.478 --> 20:36.747
You gonna be able to
look her in the eye?

20:47.358 --> 20:49.194
- Tandy!
- Tyrone?

20:49.227 --> 20:51.228
There's nobody there, Tandy.

20:51.262 --> 20:53.732
<i>Tyrone, can you hear me?</i>

20:53.765 --> 20:55.699
Your friends are all gone.

20:57.368 --> 20:59.538
Not this friend.

20:59.571 --> 21:01.607
Tyrone!

21:04.042 --> 21:05.377
Tandy...

21:15.085 --> 21:16.921
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>
- Tandy, I hear you!

21:20.091 --> 21:21.760
You can't just get rid of me.

21:21.793 --> 21:23.695
I'm a part of you.

21:23.727 --> 21:26.398
Of who you are.

21:26.430 --> 21:29.030
<i>There are certain
things you can't escape.</i>

21:29.077 --> 21:30.701
Whether you like it or not.

21:36.908 --> 21:38.764
- Where are we?
<i>- Ty?</i>

21:38.810 --> 21:40.378
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- Tandy!

21:40.410 --> 21:41.746
Tandy, he put us here.

21:41.778 --> 21:42.780
<i>Andre!</i>

21:42.814 --> 21:44.149
He separated us!

21:45.749 --> 21:46.984
Screw that!

21:49.454 --> 21:51.323
Follow my voice.

22:00.198 --> 22:01.333
Tandy!

22:06.753 --> 22:09.096
<i>Ty, you're getting louder.</i>

22:09.121 --> 22:09.975
So are you!

22:12.635 --> 22:14.112
Stop fighting it.

22:15.846 --> 22:17.471
<i>Tandy, this way!</i>

22:23.720 --> 22:25.489
You're only making it
harder on yourself, kids.

22:39.705 --> 22:42.774
- He's not here.
- Well, technically, I'm everywhere.

22:42.806 --> 22:45.027
I thought you went to
Catholic school, Mr. Johnson.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.802
You two, on the other
hand, have one place to be:

22:48.872 --> 22:50.508
in your own heads.

22:50.582 --> 22:53.618
There ain't no way out of
a hole you dig yourself.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.399
Please, no!

23:12.769 --> 23:15.239
- Fuchs?
- Come on, O'Reilly.

23:15.273 --> 23:17.641
Are you ever gonna stop hurting me?

23:19.910 --> 23:22.147
Hey, you know that thing we do?

23:22.179 --> 23:23.715
Which one?

23:23.747 --> 23:26.517
The thing where we see each other's
shit more clearly from the outside?

23:28.119 --> 23:29.755
I do know that one.

23:33.757 --> 23:35.427
We switch partners?

23:36.794 --> 23:38.796
If anyone can kick my ass, it's you.

23:52.576 --> 23:54.712
- This isn't you.
- Look who's talking.

23:54.746 --> 23:57.381
I mean, what have you become?

23:59.217 --> 24:01.018
Please stop.

24:01.052 --> 24:04.856
All your anger, all your pain.

24:04.889 --> 24:06.558
Don't let it eat you up.

24:09.093 --> 24:10.461
I miss you.

24:19.265 --> 24:21.372
And I'm sorry.

24:21.406 --> 24:22.774
You should be.

24:22.806 --> 24:25.242
You all but killed me yourself.

24:25.276 --> 24:27.478
You'll never be able
to escape your past.

24:29.947 --> 24:31.750
I wasn't talking about the past.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.796
This is not your fight.

24:45.830 --> 24:47.716
What's up? You don't hit men?

24:50.000 --> 24:51.735
It was stilted enough when
I was fighting your boy,

24:51.768 --> 24:53.674
but this? This is silly.

24:54.971 --> 24:56.974
I don't know who you are

24:57.007 --> 24:58.742
or what Tandy told you, but...

24:58.793 --> 25:00.277
You do light tricks.

25:00.311 --> 25:01.646
Okay? I can move through space.

25:01.671 --> 25:04.173
Tyrone can move through space.

25:04.215 --> 25:05.750
All you can do is play the watered-down,

25:05.783 --> 25:08.285
insert-in-a-matinee-playbill
version of him.

25:08.318 --> 25:09.820
<i>Let me tell you who I am.</i>

25:09.853 --> 25:11.789
<i>I'm the guy who knows
everything you did.</i>

25:11.823 --> 25:13.525
<i>To your wife and your daughter.</i>

25:15.293 --> 25:16.921
I am the perfect version of him.

25:16.946 --> 25:18.471
You're not even half the man.

25:20.631 --> 25:21.766
<i>I see you.</i>

25:21.798 --> 25:23.468
<i>And I see that you need
someone to tell you</i>

25:23.500 --> 25:25.336
<i>that she came out the other side a hero.</i>

25:26.704 --> 25:27.939
<i>He tried to be perfect.</i>

25:27.978 --> 25:29.715
He operated out of fear.

25:29.740 --> 25:31.197
- I'm not afraid.
- That's all you are.

25:32.677 --> 25:34.346
<i>You let down your family.</i>

25:34.379 --> 25:35.756
<i>Your wife, your daughter.</i>

25:35.781 --> 25:37.920
My best friend was strong
enough to hold himself up

25:37.945 --> 25:40.053
in a world hell-bent
on knocking him down.

25:40.078 --> 25:41.720
Again and again.

25:41.753 --> 25:43.688
I was working to make
the world a better place.

25:43.720 --> 25:45.656
And he keeps getting up.

25:45.689 --> 25:47.499
Again and again.

25:47.524 --> 25:49.793
<i>You were working to break
down two beautiful people,</i>

25:49.826 --> 25:51.528
<i>because it was too damn inconvenient</i>

25:51.562 --> 25:53.132
<i>to build them up, wasn't it?</i>

25:53.157 --> 25:54.865
He's not aiming for some ideal

25:54.899 --> 25:56.868
a bunch of assholes
who don't understand him

25:56.901 --> 25:57.916
set for him,

25:57.941 --> 25:59.804
because that line moves.

25:59.836 --> 26:02.410
<i>Always.</i>

26:13.822 --> 26:14.978
Ty?

26:15.003 --> 26:16.688
<i>She came out amazing.</i>

26:16.720 --> 26:18.522
<i>Despite all you piled
up on her doorstep.</i>

26:18.555 --> 26:20.891
- Leave me alone.
- <i>She came out a fighter.</i>

26:23.127 --> 26:24.863
See, the real Ty wouldn't
have come at me like that.

26:26.863 --> 26:28.600
- He's not basic.
<i>- She's smarter than you.</i>

26:28.632 --> 26:30.735
- Not predictable.
<i>- She's better than you.</i>

26:30.767 --> 26:32.464
He rolls with everything
the world throws at him.

26:37.909 --> 26:39.511
You know, he lost his brother,

26:39.544 --> 26:41.885
then he put it all on his own shoulders.

26:41.910 --> 26:44.248
<i>She's gonna rise out
of the ashes of your anger.</i>

26:44.282 --> 26:46.444
<i>You just watch.</i>

26:46.469 --> 26:51.696
And I was in trouble, and
he reached out and saved me.

26:54.958 --> 26:56.460
You can't hold a candle to...

26:57.628 --> 26:58.963
That's enough of that.

27:14.245 --> 27:15.979
Tandy?

27:16.013 --> 27:17.682
Tandy, where are you?

27:18.949 --> 27:22.586
Tandy! Tandy!

27:26.423 --> 27:27.625
Nice move, there.

27:28.993 --> 27:31.196
You can run all you want, Mr. Johnson.

27:32.830 --> 27:35.133
But there's no escaping yourself.

27:35.166 --> 27:38.169
Now it's time to turn
back to your own fear.

27:38.704 --> 27:39.737
Tandy?

27:41.339 --> 27:42.807
Tandy's not here anymore.

27:42.840 --> 27:44.442
Where is she?

27:44.475 --> 27:46.178
You got bigger fish to fry.

27:52.883 --> 27:54.818
Time to finish what we started.

27:54.852 --> 27:56.388
Tandy. Sweetheart.

27:57.988 --> 27:59.356
Look what you got yourself into.

28:06.831 --> 28:08.657
Screw you.

28:08.682 --> 28:09.701
What?

28:12.169 --> 28:14.572
You think you can just
send your friend after me?

28:14.597 --> 28:16.306
And put me away?

28:16.340 --> 28:19.677
You're too afraid to face me yourself.

28:19.709 --> 28:21.446
It's just you and me!

28:21.478 --> 28:23.948
Your own worst enemy!

28:23.980 --> 28:25.717
You couldn't save your brother,

28:25.749 --> 28:27.951
you couldn't save your family.

28:27.985 --> 28:30.221
You're afraid of me knowing about this,

28:30.254 --> 28:31.689
about your friend, Tyrone, knowing.

28:33.858 --> 28:34.860
No.

28:36.826 --> 28:38.729
Not anymore.

28:38.763 --> 28:40.798
I can't hide anything in my past.

28:40.831 --> 28:43.635
I can't put it away.

28:43.668 --> 28:45.503
I can't put you away,
and I get that now.

28:45.535 --> 28:47.839
It occurred to me...

28:47.872 --> 28:49.806
You're supposed to be
the perfect version of me?

28:49.840 --> 28:51.729
I've been fighting you my whole life.

28:52.768 --> 28:56.347
I told you, you can't hurt me with that.

29:00.284 --> 29:01.819
How about this?

29:01.852 --> 29:03.821
Does this work for you?

29:03.853 --> 29:06.723
<i>Day after day,</i>

29:06.756 --> 29:08.727
trying to be the perfect student.

29:09.776 --> 29:10.896
The perfect son.

29:12.362 --> 29:15.199
- For what?
- The things you did won't define me.

29:16.766 --> 29:18.805
They'll affect me for sure, but...

29:19.135 --> 29:20.939
only as much as I let them.

29:20.971 --> 29:22.606
<i>I am not perfect.</i>

29:22.640 --> 29:25.008
- I've never been.
<i>- Now all I can do</i>

29:25.979 --> 29:27.766
is level up.

29:29.412 --> 29:32.273
Be better than you.

29:33.217 --> 29:35.352
Than Andre, than the world.

29:35.385 --> 29:38.390
Being angry at the world,
when you lean into it, is okay.

29:39.390 --> 29:40.925
So long as it allows you to see

29:40.958 --> 29:44.228
the things that make you
angry and change them.

29:45.729 --> 29:46.764
My friend taught me that.

29:46.796 --> 29:48.799
I wish it could be that easy.

29:50.284 --> 29:52.620
But I will always be a part of you.

29:54.270 --> 29:55.305
You're right.

29:56.806 --> 30:00.143
But I get to decide how big a part.

30:00.177 --> 30:01.446
Me.

30:01.478 --> 30:04.783
The expectations I've been
forcing myself to live up to?

30:05.850 --> 30:07.718
They're not mine.

30:07.752 --> 30:09.287
And they're not real.

30:09.888 --> 30:12.665
And you know what, Perfect Tyrone?

30:12.689 --> 30:13.759
Neither are you.

30:15.359 --> 30:17.166
In a world where the
most important thing

30:17.191 --> 30:18.895
in my life is an "A,"

30:18.929 --> 30:20.797
<i>and the second is a "B,"</i>

30:20.824 --> 30:22.660
I have a pretty good idea

30:22.699 --> 30:25.192
what I'm going to file you under, "Dad."

30:25.268 --> 30:26.379
And where's that?

30:54.965 --> 30:57.201
Y'all ready for the main show now?

31:09.220 --> 31:10.473
What did you think
you were gonna do there?

31:10.497 --> 31:12.383
- Tyrone, get out!
- I can't.

31:15.852 --> 31:17.312
The light can't be
good for the migraines.

31:22.930 --> 31:25.516
- You missed.
- I wasn't aiming for you.

31:28.833 --> 31:30.301
How'd you know that was gonna work?

31:30.333 --> 31:32.737
A wise man once told
me they're made of hope.

31:41.077 --> 31:42.513
Looking for this?

32:11.941 --> 32:13.777
Your girl seems to have disappeared.

32:13.811 --> 32:15.640
And it looks like you
two are out of tricks.

32:15.665 --> 32:17.448
Almost.

32:17.480 --> 32:18.749
We got one more.

32:52.315 --> 32:55.082
Let's see what kind of
despair you have under there.

33:14.138 --> 33:16.439
What are you looking for?

33:16.472 --> 33:18.675
The one you play the most.

33:24.814 --> 33:27.285
All the pain you don't
put on anyone else?

33:29.385 --> 33:31.522
Your victimless crimes?

33:35.793 --> 33:37.408
This is what it feels like.

33:56.145 --> 33:57.915
Someone being in your head?

33:58.815 --> 34:00.985
It sucks, doesn't it?

34:10.237 --> 34:12.369
Where did they all disappear to?

34:27.377 --> 34:28.946
Welcome back.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.228
What are you doing here?

34:33.040 --> 34:35.753
It's church. It's where
you find yourself, right?

34:45.929 --> 34:47.764
You know, speaking of which...

34:48.933 --> 34:51.436
I might need a favor to ask a cop.

34:53.437 --> 34:54.772
What do you got in mind?

35:28.117 --> 35:29.820
<i>Including evidence of a cover-up</i>

35:29.867 --> 35:31.741
<i>in what looks like police fratricide</i>

35:31.782 --> 35:34.953
<i>in a case that framed local
student Tyrone Johnson.</i>

35:34.978 --> 35:36.379
<i>Details are still...</i>

38:16.339 --> 38:17.874
No. No, man. No deal.

38:17.908 --> 38:19.210
Don't want your business.

38:19.243 --> 38:20.744
The hell are you talking about?

38:20.777 --> 38:23.181
Hey, you heard my boy. Move it on.

39:08.324 --> 39:09.826
I called aisle seat.

39:20.169 --> 39:21.704
That all the stuff you got from Brigid?

39:21.737 --> 39:24.038
Should we even call her that anymore?

39:24.674 --> 39:26.359
What else would we call her?

39:26.843 --> 39:29.580
Brigid is fine.

39:31.381 --> 39:34.489
That the place?

39:34.514 --> 39:36.953
Yeah.

39:36.986 --> 39:39.556
Brigid said a bunch of girls
were found dead on the beach.

39:39.589 --> 39:40.723
Outside the city.

39:42.893 --> 39:44.395
Never been there before.

39:46.096 --> 39:48.498
Never been anywhere.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.201
But I think some change

39:52.226 --> 39:54.138
could be good for me right now.

39:56.739 --> 39:58.882
You and me both.

40:08.785 --> 40:10.187
Do you think we can do it?

40:12.355 --> 40:13.690
What's that?

40:15.259 --> 40:16.927
Be good.

40:17.852 --> 40:21.132
Be heroes.

40:22.765 --> 40:25.602
Be divine and paired in other places?

40:29.640 --> 40:31.808
Let me answer that question
with another question.

40:33.076 --> 40:34.678
And what question is that?

40:37.781 --> 40:39.949
Waffles or pancakes?

40:46.323 --> 40:48.359
Waffles.

40:48.391 --> 40:49.460
Duh.
