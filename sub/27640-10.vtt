WEBVTT

00:02.156 --> 00:03.956
I don't know why I'm
feeling this like deep,

00:04.024 --> 00:05.558
aching sense of dread.

00:05.583 --> 00:07.703
David, I'm more than capable
of looking after your store

00:07.728 --> 00:09.462
while you and Stevie
work the flea market.

00:09.487 --> 00:12.074
Why did Patrick have
to book today of all days

00:12.099 --> 00:13.062
for his tax seminar?

00:13.087 --> 00:15.898
Like who voluntarily
goes to a tax seminar?

00:15.923 --> 00:18.759
Maybe the kinds of people who
want to keep their businesses?

00:19.874 --> 00:20.827
Okay, hi.

00:20.852 --> 00:24.043
You are literally only
here to receive a package.

00:24.068 --> 00:26.103
So I cannot have you
distracted your phone...

00:26.128 --> 00:28.863
unless there's an emergency.
And then immediately call...

00:28.888 --> 00:30.222
Call Patrick. I know!

00:30.247 --> 00:32.293
No! Patrick is at the tax seminar!

00:32.319 --> 00:33.887
Are you hearing anything I'm saying?!

00:33.912 --> 00:36.532
Yes. Stay off your phone.
Wait for the delivery man

00:36.557 --> 00:38.558
to drop off whatever. You can trust me.

00:38.583 --> 00:39.983
Okay, can I?

00:40.008 --> 00:41.820
Because the last time I left
you in charge of something...

00:41.845 --> 00:44.740
Ugh! This is about
those stupid Tamagotchi?

00:44.765 --> 00:47.066
- Actually it is.
- Okay guys...

00:47.091 --> 00:48.959
You left me with six of them, David.

00:48.984 --> 00:51.219
Taking care of that many
is like a full-time job!

00:51.244 --> 00:55.417
I left you with six adult
Tamagotchis in perfect health!

00:55.442 --> 00:58.077
And by the time I came
home, they were all dead.

00:58.102 --> 01:00.689
You have to like actively murder them

01:00.714 --> 01:02.982
- in order for that to happen!
- Okay, David,

01:03.007 --> 01:05.828
um, as much as I love carrying
out all these boxes by myself,

01:05.853 --> 01:07.499
I think she's going to be okay,

01:07.524 --> 01:09.725
so maybe you could give me a hand?

01:09.906 --> 01:12.073
How did David con
you into this anyway?

01:12.559 --> 01:14.571
It gives me an excuse to
take a break from rehearsals

01:14.595 --> 01:16.429
with your mom for a day?

01:16.454 --> 01:18.593
Um, last night she texted me at 3 A.M.

01:18.618 --> 01:20.786
and all it said was "leggings."

01:21.468 --> 01:23.546
- Hmm...
- We have to go.

01:23.571 --> 01:25.648
Um, you're welcome,
by the way, David.

01:26.026 --> 01:27.507
Who knows, maybe after today

01:27.532 --> 01:30.100
you'll finally stop
talking about... Tamagotchi.

01:30.125 --> 01:32.727
Unlikely... murderer.

01:42.747 --> 01:44.833
Unfortunately for everyone, John,

01:44.858 --> 01:46.859
Stevie turned out to be quite the find.

01:47.037 --> 01:49.964
She'll need a lot of
direction obviously, but...

01:49.989 --> 01:52.024
you know, ballet intensive,

01:52.049 --> 01:54.386
perhaps some mittens
to curb the nail biting.

01:54.411 --> 01:56.478
Moira, I love the
way you pour yourself

01:56.503 --> 01:57.589
into your projects.

01:57.614 --> 01:59.596
But the whole point of this spa trip

01:59.621 --> 02:02.290
was to take a breather from cabaret.

02:02.315 --> 02:05.754
Yes John. I promise to
enjoy the 60 minutes I'll spend

02:05.779 --> 02:08.047
having my deepest tissues palpated.

02:08.148 --> 02:10.745
Then a few sips of cucumber water.

02:10.770 --> 02:12.871
Factor in five minutes for
you to use the facilities

02:12.917 --> 02:14.418
and we'll be back home by noon.

02:14.443 --> 02:16.534
And we're not rushing
through this, Moira.

02:16.559 --> 02:19.428
We've got an entire day
of treatments ahead of us.

02:19.453 --> 02:21.776
Today is for slowing down,

02:21.801 --> 02:25.386
and getting reacquainted
with our bodies.

02:26.600 --> 02:29.102
Okay, just please give me
a moment to make a decision

02:29.127 --> 02:30.433
on this chaise lounge.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.063
Oh, put the phone down, Moira.

02:32.088 --> 02:33.655
Whatever it is can wait.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.815
It's for Fraulein Schneider's Salon.

02:35.962 --> 02:38.420
Do you prefer the olive
suede to the Merlot?

02:38.445 --> 02:41.987
Similar texture but falls
apart in emotional complexity.

02:42.012 --> 02:44.183
I can't look right
now, Moira. I'm driving.

02:44.208 --> 02:45.809
All right. I'll hold it up for you.

02:45.834 --> 02:47.235
No, Moira, I can't right now.

02:47.260 --> 02:48.927
It's just a quick glance, John!

02:48.952 --> 02:50.596
All right, then you
need to hold it straighter.

02:50.621 --> 02:52.522
That... oh-oh, what was that?

02:52.926 --> 02:55.294
- A tiny speed bump.
- Speed bump?

02:55.319 --> 02:56.686
We're in the middle of nowhere.

02:56.711 --> 02:58.111
Why would there be a speed bump?

02:58.136 --> 03:00.704
No, I think I, I think I hit an animal.

03:00.886 --> 03:03.053
Oh, it's the circle of life, John.

03:03.303 --> 03:05.671
You've just provided
a nice Passover Seder

03:05.696 --> 03:07.797
for a family of hawks.

03:08.963 --> 03:10.830
No... ew...

03:14.453 --> 03:16.654
John,

03:17.026 --> 03:18.518
don't get too close, dear.

03:18.619 --> 03:20.853
We can't afford you contracting mange.

03:20.878 --> 03:24.136
It's a cat, Moira. I hit a cat!

03:24.691 --> 03:27.093
Well, what kind of ailurophobe

03:27.118 --> 03:28.618
sends their kitty out to play

03:28.643 --> 03:31.278
on such a busy stretch of highway?

03:31.303 --> 03:33.604
It's got a collar!
This is someone's pet.

03:35.753 --> 03:37.746
There's a farmhouse right there,

03:37.771 --> 03:39.878
probably belongs to them.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.376
Or not.

03:47.781 --> 03:49.282
Okay, so this is really good,

03:49.383 --> 03:51.684
we just need everything
facing forward. Facing forward.

03:51.861 --> 03:54.596
Facing forward. See what I'm doing here?

03:54.621 --> 03:56.189
Okay, like a serial killer?

03:56.290 --> 03:59.025
David Rose!

03:59.126 --> 04:02.097
- Oh God!
- Would you look at that?

04:02.122 --> 04:04.263
If this isn't a full circle moment,

04:04.288 --> 04:08.158
- then I'm not twice divorced.
- My God, Wendy!

04:08.183 --> 04:10.351
This must be your wife.

04:10.432 --> 04:11.511
- No.
- God, no.

04:11.536 --> 04:13.870
No, no, Wendy, this
is my friend, Stevie.

04:13.928 --> 04:15.295
Stevie, this is Wendy.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.654
Wendy used to employ
me at the Blouse Barn.

04:17.911 --> 04:20.913
I'm so sorry, I don't
mean to jump to conclusions.

04:20.938 --> 04:24.401
I guess I've got marriage
on the brain again.

04:24.500 --> 04:27.201
If you can believe it, I'm engaged!

04:27.654 --> 04:29.822
- Hmm, wow.
- Congratulations.

04:29.847 --> 04:32.849
Well, you know what
they say about love,

04:32.874 --> 04:34.842
it's like target practice,

04:34.867 --> 04:37.651
if you just keep shooting at it...

04:40.138 --> 04:44.698
Anyway, David, I was hoping you
would have settled down by now!

04:44.805 --> 04:47.440
Oh, I actually own this
business with my partner.

04:47.465 --> 04:48.999
Get outta town!

04:49.024 --> 04:51.692
I know, I am as shocked as you are.

04:51.764 --> 04:54.900
Well, I guess that
makes us flea buddies.

04:54.925 --> 04:56.472
I've got my own booth.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.796
Wow, so we're
reopening the Blouse Barn?

04:58.828 --> 05:02.986
Oh, no, no, no, just test
driving a new business idea,

05:03.011 --> 05:07.780
brought to me by my
new partner, Antonio.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.875
Antonio!

05:10.335 --> 05:11.902
What are you doing?

05:11.927 --> 05:14.562
Come over here, so I can show you off!

05:17.062 --> 05:18.763
Hey.

05:18.788 --> 05:21.523
Well, Antonio, say hi to everyone.

05:21.706 --> 05:23.807
- Hi.
- You look very familiar.

05:23.892 --> 05:25.827
Have I seen you in my store before?

05:25.905 --> 05:27.505
I don't think so.

05:27.530 --> 05:29.431
Okay.

05:32.949 --> 05:34.717
He seems sweet.

05:34.742 --> 05:36.676
He reminds me a lot of you.

05:36.701 --> 05:39.770
Well, isn't that a
compliment. For him.

05:40.227 --> 05:43.414
I better get back and
help Tony set up the booth.

05:43.439 --> 05:47.209
It was such a treat seeing you, David!

05:47.507 --> 05:49.272
And you, Karen!

05:51.186 --> 05:52.569
Karen's a new one.

05:52.594 --> 05:55.963
I have... definitely seen
that guy in my store before.

05:55.988 --> 05:58.967
Do you think that
Wendy knows her fiancé

05:58.999 --> 06:01.108
has been checking out every guy in here?

06:01.133 --> 06:03.892
She has the worst taste in men.

06:03.917 --> 06:05.418
At one point, she told me

06:05.443 --> 06:08.111
she was looking for a Jon Gosselin type.

06:11.992 --> 06:13.960
Sorry, we're closed.

06:13.985 --> 06:15.061
Very funny.

06:15.086 --> 06:17.697
Ugh, I was hoping you
were the delivery guy.

06:17.722 --> 06:19.990
- Thanks.
- No, I'm just like, so bored.

06:20.015 --> 06:23.250
Well, I am not the delivery
guy, but I come bearing gifts.

06:26.050 --> 06:28.084
But I didn't pay for that.

06:28.109 --> 06:30.844
I know, I got it at the flea market.

06:31.445 --> 06:33.788
Thank you for the delivery.

06:33.813 --> 06:36.281
Do you need my signature?

06:36.683 --> 06:38.303
Oops.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.243
Oh... wow!

06:41.427 --> 06:44.186
Uh... um, miss,

06:44.715 --> 06:48.084
seems that the strap has
fallen off of your shoulder.

06:48.232 --> 06:50.530
I'd offer to put it back for you,

06:50.555 --> 06:53.090
but as a delivery guy,

06:53.312 --> 06:54.779
I don't know if it's my place.

06:54.804 --> 06:57.600
Oh, how respectful.

06:57.810 --> 07:00.845
Now, if only you had that
much respect for my time.

07:01.048 --> 07:03.449
I've been waiting here forever.

07:03.474 --> 07:05.942
Um, sorry that I'm late...

07:05.967 --> 07:10.342
my... grandmother passed this morning.

07:10.367 --> 07:12.288
Ew! Oh my God, Ted!

07:12.489 --> 07:14.724
Sorry, I wasn't prepared for an improv.

07:14.749 --> 07:16.583
No, it's fine, it's fine.

07:17.010 --> 07:20.879
Okay, what else
weren't you prepared for?

07:21.632 --> 07:25.311
- The... import taxes?
- Hmm...

07:25.832 --> 07:27.277
Okay, obviously I'm not good at this,

07:27.301 --> 07:28.578
can we just skip to the good part?

07:28.602 --> 07:31.037
Yes. Okay.

07:32.788 --> 07:35.408
So, you and I just
innocently witnessed

07:35.433 --> 07:36.673
an 18-wheeler barreling down...

07:36.698 --> 07:38.458
Moira, I'm just gonna
be honest, all right?

07:38.483 --> 07:41.957
There was an accident, it
was tragic, unavoidable,

07:42.136 --> 07:44.217
and then we'll be on our way.

07:44.242 --> 07:46.443
Mm-Kay.

07:52.911 --> 07:54.845
Can I help you?

07:56.006 --> 07:58.574
What... beautiful day, isn't it?

07:58.683 --> 08:01.052
- Crops need rain.
- Yes, yes.

08:01.169 --> 08:03.370
Oh, as they often do.

08:04.277 --> 08:08.125
Um... well, we just had
an unfortunate thing...

08:08.150 --> 08:12.220
My husband struck down
your feline with our car.

08:12.499 --> 08:14.534
Well, we don't necessarily know

08:14.559 --> 08:17.479
whether the cat belongs
to this uh, gentleman.

08:17.504 --> 08:19.105
Well, what did it look like?

08:19.130 --> 08:22.671
The name on the tags was "Sergio"?

08:23.233 --> 08:25.701
Well, that was him.

08:25.726 --> 08:28.733
Oh, these city people
driving too damn fast

08:28.758 --> 08:30.303
up and down this road.

08:30.328 --> 08:33.158
No, I-I don't think speed
was-was the thing here.

08:33.183 --> 08:36.178
No, my husband has what's
called a feather foot.

08:36.203 --> 08:38.971
Well then, why did you stop?

08:39.072 --> 08:43.008
We thought it was...
the decent thing to do.

08:43.033 --> 08:44.577
Um, now that's done,

08:44.602 --> 08:46.803
and we have a very
pressing engagement so.

08:47.169 --> 08:48.969
Well, my wife is so right,

08:48.994 --> 08:51.596
we're running very late right now.

08:51.621 --> 08:54.870
The Hammam Spas are
notoriously fickle about refunds.

08:54.895 --> 08:56.629
You're going to the spa?

08:56.957 --> 08:59.194
Well, that does sound important,

08:59.219 --> 09:01.120
but since you just
killed my daughter's cat,

09:01.145 --> 09:02.779
coming inside to break the news to her

09:02.804 --> 09:04.504
might be a little bit more important.

09:04.529 --> 09:06.272
Don't you think?

09:07.054 --> 09:09.599
Hm, John, shall I pick
you up on the way back?

09:09.624 --> 09:12.777
I know how desperate you were
for me to have my day of detox.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.060
No! No, Moira!

09:15.085 --> 09:18.741
I think it's better if
you... come inside with me,

09:18.766 --> 09:20.333
so we can uh,

09:20.956 --> 09:23.691
break the news together.

09:27.398 --> 09:28.918
Okay, this is the last of them,

09:28.943 --> 09:31.044
unless you wanted me to
bring in the 14 coffee cups

09:31.145 --> 09:33.665
and 3 empty chip bags that
are also in your back seat?

09:33.690 --> 09:37.325
Mhmm. David, remember when
you thought Wendy's partner

09:37.350 --> 09:39.237
had been in your store before?

09:39.262 --> 09:41.412
He has been in my store before.

09:41.437 --> 09:43.048
Well, I think I know
why he wasn't being

09:43.072 --> 09:44.373
so upfront about it.

09:44.398 --> 09:45.878
Okay, I know what you're gonna say,

09:45.903 --> 09:47.483
and I also thought that he
was into me for a second,

09:47.508 --> 09:49.499
but I'm pretty sure
that's just his face.

09:49.524 --> 09:51.758
No. Look over at their booth,

09:51.783 --> 09:54.819
and tell me you don't
notice any similarities.

09:58.383 --> 10:01.175
- What the actual fuck?!
- I know.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.359
- They've ripped off our entire store.
- Yeah.

10:04.384 --> 10:07.119
Tulips instead of roses? Woof!

10:07.296 --> 10:09.831
Similar products. The
labels even look like ours.

10:09.856 --> 10:11.524
Except, their stuff's half price.

10:11.549 --> 10:13.283
What?

10:13.308 --> 10:14.852
Well, we have a very loyal customer base

10:14.877 --> 10:18.316
who would not be fooled
by some skanky knockoff.

10:18.341 --> 10:20.709
Okay, Dave, I'm
ready to check out here.

10:20.734 --> 10:22.435
Roland! What are you doing here?

10:22.460 --> 10:23.837
You're supposed to be at the motel!

10:23.862 --> 10:26.597
I'm on my coffee break,
and I ran out of foot cream.

10:26.925 --> 10:30.591
- Those are 3 for 15, yes?
- These are not from our store.

10:30.616 --> 10:31.953
Well, what are you talking about?

10:31.978 --> 10:33.612
I just got 'em off
your table over there.

10:33.637 --> 10:34.975
That's not our table.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.068
Well then, why were
you standing there?

10:37.215 --> 10:40.382
That's not me! And
he's still standing there!

10:41.487 --> 10:44.155
Okay um, do you want the sale, or not?

10:44.180 --> 10:47.102
Uh no, you can buy
our superior foot cream

10:47.127 --> 10:48.461
at a slightly higher price.

10:48.638 --> 10:50.472
Geez. You were a lot nicer

10:50.497 --> 10:52.565
when I was talking to you over there.

10:58.694 --> 11:00.292
How far do you think we'd get

11:00.317 --> 11:02.218
if we just started running?

11:04.196 --> 11:06.816
When might we expect
your daughter to show up,

11:06.841 --> 11:10.635
because we do have a
very busy day ahead of us?

11:10.660 --> 11:12.894
Well, baby's still sleeping,

11:12.934 --> 11:15.636
but if you wanna go and wake her up,

11:15.661 --> 11:17.862
tell her what happened, by all means.

11:18.100 --> 11:20.836
Where is Bebe's chamber?

11:22.295 --> 11:24.630
Oh, there she is now.

11:24.655 --> 11:26.856
She's either up, or takin' a leak.

11:27.109 --> 11:30.445
Either way, great progress for Bebe.

11:30.470 --> 11:32.301
Here she is.

11:32.473 --> 11:34.807
What's all this?

11:35.002 --> 11:36.703
Who are you?

11:36.728 --> 11:40.668
Uh, hi, Johnny Rose, Baby.

11:42.627 --> 11:44.728
- This is my uh...
- Sergio's dead!

11:44.753 --> 11:46.321
Ugh.

11:47.727 --> 11:49.094
What the hell?

11:49.119 --> 11:51.183
Yes, it seems he had taken ill,

11:51.208 --> 11:53.738
and stumbled out on the road poor thing,

11:53.763 --> 11:56.031
presumably to end it all.

11:56.056 --> 11:57.923
And then?

11:58.239 --> 11:59.773
And then we ran over him.

12:01.000 --> 12:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:09.854 --> 12:14.082
Anyway, this feels like a
very private family moment...

12:14.458 --> 12:17.494
that we're more than willing to share.

12:27.333 --> 12:29.167
That's for you.

12:29.268 --> 12:31.557
Clearly that brand loyalty
you were talking about

12:31.582 --> 12:33.438
is really paying off.

12:33.463 --> 12:36.231
Like to pay you off
to not be here anymore.

12:37.786 --> 12:40.054
Roland, what are
you still doing here?

12:40.079 --> 12:41.680
This will only take a second.

12:41.857 --> 12:44.225
Dave, I don't know if
you remember or not,

12:44.250 --> 12:46.451
but I purchased some foot
cream from you earlier?

12:46.476 --> 12:48.329
That wasn't our foot cream.

12:48.354 --> 12:50.222
Yeah, okay, well
you took my 15 bucks,

12:50.247 --> 12:52.081
and now I'd like a refund,

12:52.106 --> 12:53.817
because I realized I've
used this stuff before,

12:53.842 --> 12:56.577
- and it makes my feet stink.
- Give me that.

12:58.698 --> 13:00.332
Ugh!

13:00.433 --> 13:02.434
It smells like pennies and burps!

13:02.535 --> 13:04.921
Oh yeah! Wait, that
smells exactly like the stuff

13:04.946 --> 13:06.280
we used to use at the motel.

13:06.305 --> 13:09.004
- Ugh.
- Like, exactly.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.385
Wait a second...

13:15.157 --> 13:16.991
That's why!

13:17.016 --> 13:18.550
Gel Time Moist Liquid.

13:18.575 --> 13:21.565
Contains 100% moist liquid.

13:21.590 --> 13:24.033
- Uh
- oh, Davey got busted!

13:24.058 --> 13:25.924
Okay, this is not our product, Roland!

13:25.949 --> 13:28.994
Anyone who sells counterfeit
luxury beauty products

13:29.019 --> 13:30.659
is clearly a sociopath.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.171
Dave, I don't wanna tell
you how to run your business,

13:33.196 --> 13:36.507
but 3 or 15 dollars for
Gel Time is a total rip-off.

13:36.532 --> 13:39.444
I mean, pharmacies hand those
out for free on Halloween.

13:39.469 --> 13:41.703
David, you have to talk to Wendy.

13:41.728 --> 13:43.039
Okay, what am I gonna tell her?

13:43.063 --> 13:46.385
That her curious life partner,
who looks nothing like me,

13:46.410 --> 13:48.644
is some big old con artist?

13:50.428 --> 13:51.895
$18 for toner?

13:51.920 --> 13:54.241
Why don't you just on some Gel Time?

13:54.266 --> 13:56.567
That stuff will strip
your skin right off.

13:57.965 --> 14:00.033
Ooh.

14:00.734 --> 14:02.868
Whoa! That was...

14:03.383 --> 14:05.651
I know, like are good,
but that was like...

14:05.676 --> 14:07.611
You pulled some new tricks out.

14:07.725 --> 14:08.992
New to you.

14:09.156 --> 14:11.657
Anyway, David should
leave you in charge

14:11.758 --> 14:13.726
of the store more often.

14:13.751 --> 14:16.638
Um... Ted, the door was
unlocked the entire time!

14:16.663 --> 14:18.264
What?

14:18.441 --> 14:20.342
Someone could've
like, walked in on us.

14:20.367 --> 14:22.568
They would've gotten quite the show!

14:22.731 --> 14:27.035
It's very... irresponsible
and dangerous of us.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.941
Well, now we know for next time.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.210
Oh, um, I almost forgot,

14:31.235 --> 14:33.737
I never signed for that parcel.

14:33.990 --> 14:36.425
Uh, I don't think the guy showed up?

14:36.450 --> 14:37.883
No, Ted...

14:38.984 --> 14:43.680
Oh uh... oh, yeah I...
I'd get your signature,

14:43.705 --> 14:47.269
but I guess I left my clipboard

14:47.294 --> 14:49.428
and scanner thing somewhere, so.

14:49.605 --> 14:52.007
Do you think it might
be in David's new bathroom?

14:52.108 --> 14:54.009
Apparently it's just for customers,

14:54.034 --> 14:55.835
but he never lets anyone use it.

14:56.012 --> 14:58.547
I remember now, I definitely
left my scanner thing in there.

14:58.572 --> 15:01.807
- Mhm... let's go
- let's go find your scanner thing.

15:01.907 --> 15:03.619
Can I just request we
actually drop the scanner

15:03.644 --> 15:05.560
thing bit just 'cause
it's kinda throwing me off.

15:05.585 --> 15:06.919
Yeah, okay.

15:08.815 --> 15:10.149
Oh, this is nice!

15:10.250 --> 15:12.451
- Uh
- Oh! Is that a sink?

15:12.552 --> 15:13.886
Oh! A sink it is!

15:15.646 --> 15:17.914
Help me up, babe.

15:20.060 --> 15:22.161
- Oh my God!
- Fuck! Ugh!

15:24.640 --> 15:28.243
How are we still trapped
in this Gothic horror show?

15:28.344 --> 15:31.447
You know, I think we've
already missed the seaweed wrap,

15:31.472 --> 15:34.574
and at this rate, it's not
looking good for the salt scrub.

15:35.885 --> 15:38.253
You know, I wish there was
something else we could do here,

15:38.278 --> 15:42.057
but uh, I really feel we've
overstayed our welcome.

15:42.082 --> 15:44.250
Yes, we should really hit the road.

15:44.275 --> 15:46.776
In that big, fancy car of yours?

15:46.801 --> 15:50.374
Oh it's... it's big, but
it's not that fancy.

15:50.921 --> 15:52.324
Listen folks,

15:52.426 --> 15:53.959
we don't want much,

15:54.420 --> 15:58.256
but you should cover the
expenses of the funeral.

15:58.882 --> 16:01.250
The funeral... for your cat?

16:01.601 --> 16:03.736
Well, it was Baby's only cat.

16:03.761 --> 16:05.981
Perhaps it's the lack of air,

16:06.006 --> 16:08.140
but I believe I saw three or four cats

16:08.165 --> 16:10.500
running around since
this interrogation began.

16:10.622 --> 16:12.757
It was my only tabby.

16:12.782 --> 16:15.590
Okay, well maybe there's
something we can do.

16:15.615 --> 16:18.250
Does Bebe enjoy the theater?

16:18.275 --> 16:19.676
Hmm?

16:19.701 --> 16:22.501
How about two complimentary,

16:22.526 --> 16:25.823
partially-obstructed
view seats to Cabaret?

16:25.848 --> 16:28.617
No! She likes the Kinky Shoes.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.481
You got tickets to Kinky Shoes?

16:31.506 --> 16:34.541
I believe it's Kinky Boots. And no.

16:34.566 --> 16:38.407
Well, maybe a professional massage

16:38.432 --> 16:41.183
might help ease Baby's pain.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.075
I like massages.

16:43.100 --> 16:45.320
So, now you're
taking Bebe to the spa?

16:45.765 --> 16:48.090
No, I wouldn't be taking her Moira,

16:48.115 --> 16:52.184
but maybe Baby can take
her uh, grandmother.

16:52.209 --> 16:53.777
- I'm her mother!
- Yes, well that...

16:53.802 --> 16:55.497
Yes, you are!

16:55.522 --> 16:59.892
And you are going to adore
the rejuvenating facial peel.

17:00.079 --> 17:02.681
Can I keep the slippers?

17:04.564 --> 17:06.298
This is my favourite after shave.

17:06.476 --> 17:07.476
This is for you.

17:07.501 --> 17:09.001
- Go!
- Okay.

17:09.102 --> 17:12.338
On my feet...

17:12.363 --> 17:14.431
- Hi.
- Wendy, hi!

17:14.455 --> 17:16.685
David! Isn't this great?

17:16.710 --> 17:19.078
The two of us, back together!

17:19.103 --> 17:22.972
Successful in business!
Successful in love.

17:23.150 --> 17:25.718
- Mhmm, totally.
- Quick question for you, Wen...

17:25.819 --> 17:28.507
You know, when Antonio
came to me with this idea,

17:28.531 --> 17:30.766
I wasn't sure there was a market

17:30.791 --> 17:32.491
for another general store.

17:32.668 --> 17:34.302
Everyone is doing them now.

17:34.327 --> 17:36.214
Yeah, I was one of
the first, but I get it.

17:36.239 --> 17:38.340
And they sell all the same stuff.

17:38.365 --> 17:41.201
I'm sure you've noticed a similarity

17:41.226 --> 17:44.546
- between our products and yours.
- Sure did.

17:44.571 --> 17:46.272
Wendy can I speak with you for a moment?

17:46.297 --> 17:47.630
Sure.

17:48.226 --> 17:50.361
Why don't we go over to your booth?

17:50.386 --> 17:52.888
It's so much quieter.

17:52.913 --> 17:54.413
Okay.

17:55.549 --> 17:59.270
Um, I don't wanna be the
one to have to tell you this,

17:59.295 --> 18:01.463
but it's about your fiancé...

18:01.720 --> 18:03.609
You know Brad?

18:04.425 --> 18:07.335
- Who's Brad?
- My fiance.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.695
I thought you and Antonio were...

18:09.720 --> 18:11.721
Oh David...

18:11.746 --> 18:14.348
We're business partners.

18:14.601 --> 18:17.085
Oh! Okay.

18:17.737 --> 18:19.705
Well, that's gonna make
this a little easier.

18:19.730 --> 18:22.884
Turns out Antonio is a common criminal.

18:23.034 --> 18:25.169
- What?
- Stevie give me the...

18:26.088 --> 18:27.656
Look at this, please.

18:27.857 --> 18:30.892
100% moist liquid?

18:31.351 --> 18:34.563
Antonio said it was locally sourced.

18:34.588 --> 18:36.874
Sure. If you consider
the dollar store local.

18:36.899 --> 18:38.967
These sell for 99 cents.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.993
Well, he's been charging me way more!

18:41.507 --> 18:43.338
I'm so sorry, you had to hear this.

18:43.363 --> 18:45.264
No, David,

18:45.441 --> 18:46.975
I'm glad you told me.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.602
I was gonna go into
business with this person.

18:50.429 --> 18:52.814
And I'm ashamed to say,

18:52.839 --> 18:55.074
in my weaker moments,

18:55.417 --> 18:59.086
I've been tempted to
cheat on poor, sweet Brad.

19:00.867 --> 19:02.047
With Antonio?

19:02.224 --> 19:04.893
Well, obviously you picked up

19:04.918 --> 19:07.342
on the intense heat between us

19:07.367 --> 19:10.532
- if you thought we were a couple.
- Yeah.

19:10.557 --> 19:12.024
Wendy, for several reasons

19:12.049 --> 19:14.135
I think you need to
say goodbye to Antonio.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.705
Ugh. How I'm gonna tell Brad.

19:17.046 --> 19:19.674
He and Antonio are roommates.

19:19.775 --> 19:23.044
They share this tiny
one-bedroom together.

19:23.437 --> 19:25.513
And it is so crowded in there,

19:25.538 --> 19:27.740
they had to put the
mirror on the ceiling.

19:29.318 --> 19:31.052
Yeah. Best to shut
all that down, I think.

19:31.153 --> 19:33.288
David,

19:33.579 --> 19:36.258
what would I do without you?

19:36.446 --> 19:38.613
I literally don't know, Wendy.

19:39.671 --> 19:42.982
You wanna get high?

19:43.007 --> 19:46.078
- No, but thank you.
- Okay.

19:51.702 --> 19:54.146
Okay. So, the delivery man came in,

19:54.171 --> 19:56.007
used the bathroom,

19:56.032 --> 19:58.000
somehow broke the sink,

19:58.025 --> 20:01.060
and then left without
delivering the package.

20:02.405 --> 20:04.373
That is correct.

20:04.550 --> 20:06.851
I just find it strange that
he would then leave a note

20:06.876 --> 20:08.710
saying, "sorry I missed you".

20:09.690 --> 20:10.956
Yeah. No...

20:10.981 --> 20:12.533
I think he meant, like,
sorry I missed you.

20:12.558 --> 20:14.659
Because I was here the entire time.

20:14.684 --> 20:16.729
And I actually think that he
was like a little bit drunk,

20:16.753 --> 20:19.121
because he knocked over a lot of things.

20:19.146 --> 20:20.647
And you were here for this?

20:20.672 --> 20:22.439
Um, no...

20:22.768 --> 20:25.470
Well, you were here for part of it.

20:25.495 --> 20:28.304
Right. But I got here late...

20:28.632 --> 20:31.076
my grandmother passed away.

20:31.101 --> 20:33.102
- Oh God!
- A few years ago.

20:33.127 --> 20:35.295
And it just been real tough to get over.

20:35.441 --> 20:36.874
Mhmm.

20:36.899 --> 20:38.984
Well, fortunately we had these
security cameras installed,

20:39.009 --> 20:41.277
so I guess I'll just show
that to the insurance people?

20:41.302 --> 20:42.735
I don't really know how this works,

20:42.760 --> 20:44.468
Patrick went to that seminar.

20:44.881 --> 20:46.348
Oh. Um...

20:46.373 --> 20:49.828
honestly, I-I don't think
that you wanna do that.

20:52.188 --> 20:54.256
You said that I could trust you.

20:54.433 --> 20:56.501
First, the Tamagotchies, now this!

20:56.602 --> 20:57.960
Get out of my store.

20:57.985 --> 20:59.629
Okay, fine. You can
take the money for the sink

20:59.654 --> 21:01.465
out of what you were
going to pay me for today.

21:01.490 --> 21:03.135
I wasn't planning
on paying you anything.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.660
Get out!

21:04.901 --> 21:06.568
You too. Very disappointed.

21:06.746 --> 21:08.380
And if we're pointing fingers, David,

21:08.405 --> 21:10.873
I've done it on a lot of sinks
and I've never had an issue.

21:10.974 --> 21:12.852
When you say you've done
it on a lot of sinks...

21:12.876 --> 21:14.076
Out!

21:14.177 --> 21:15.911
Hmm.

21:15.936 --> 21:19.187
Ugh! I don't wanna touch this.
