NARRA TOR:
Previously on Heroes.

00:03.838 --> 00:04.953
I had a dream.

00:05.047 --> 00:06.378
I know what
we have to do now.

00:06.465 --> 00:08.001
We need to bring
this family together.

00:08.092 --> 00:09.878
And then we need
to go visit my sister.

00:09.969 --> 00:13.678
Do you know about
what happened at the place
called Coyote Sands?

00:13.764 --> 00:17.348
When your grandmother has
a dream, it's a good idea
to pay attention.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.095
My father started
writing the government

00:19.187 --> 00:23.226
looking for information
on an abandoned government
project in the 1960s.

00:23.316 --> 00:24.726
If you know something...

00:24.817 --> 00:27.854
Never said what but
it was around the time
his nightmares kicked in.

00:27.945 --> 00:30.231
I could hear him
yelling up here
night after night.

00:30.323 --> 00:33.736
MOHINDER: The files are
heavily redacted, but it
mentions medical research

00:33.826 --> 00:35.908
at a place
called Coyote Sands.

00:35.995 --> 00:37.280
My father was there.

00:38.247 --> 00:39.327
There it is.

00:39.415 --> 00:40.825
Peter and l are
headed there now.

00:40.917 --> 00:43.124
I spoke with Nathan.
He and Claire will meet us.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.246
I need you with us.

00:44.337 --> 00:46.669
This is where
our story really begins.

00:46.756 --> 00:49.793
And to prepare
for the future, you have
to understand the past.

00:49.884 --> 00:50.964
You want the answers?

00:51.052 --> 00:52.667
Then you'll have to dig.

00:52.762 --> 00:54.923
It's time everyone
knew the truth.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.279
This is just wrong,

01:22.375 --> 01:24.366
digging up these graves.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.503
Why is she
making us do this?

01:26.587 --> 01:30.045
Mom has her reasons, Pete.
She'll share when she's ready.
Give her time.

01:47.692 --> 01:48.932
Look who
he's turned us into.

01:49.026 --> 01:52.518
He knows what he's done,
and he's carrying
enough guilt for all of us.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.194
But he's here,
isn't he?

01:55.032 --> 01:57.114
He needs our support.

01:57.201 --> 02:01.865
Boy, he charmed you.
Don't worry,
happens to all of us.

02:04.542 --> 02:06.203
I'm gonna go talk to her.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.634
What are we doing here,
Mom?

02:18.723 --> 02:20.884
You said we came here
to find your sister.

02:21.726 --> 02:24.217
We didn't know
you had a sister.

02:25.396 --> 02:29.230
Look, we need some answers.
Mom, what happened out here?

That's everybody.

And the best popcorn
you've ever had.

You have a funny accent.
So do you.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.246
So, where are you from?

03:33.297 --> 03:36.710
These are your quarters,
and your parents
are just across the quad.

03:36.801 --> 03:38.883

will show you the way.

but this isn't a prison.

The guards are here
for your protection.
We want to keep you safe.

with the glasses
is Bobby Bishop.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.464
I didn't think boys
were allowed
in the girls' bunk.

04:26.559 --> 04:28.220
Yes, yes, well,

04:28.310 --> 04:32.223
Bobby here, he wanted to
tell you how beautiful
he thought you were.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.638
I did not.
What?

04:34.733 --> 04:36.519
You don't think
she's beautiful?

04:36.610 --> 04:37.861
(EXHALES)

04:38.863 --> 04:40.694
Anyway, we just
wanted to say hi.

04:47.872 --> 04:51.114
I don't like this.
I wanna be
with Mom and Dad.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.244
We already
talked about this.

04:53.335 --> 04:56.122
It's gonna be fun.
Just like camp.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.378
Let's get you unpacked.

05:01.719 --> 05:03.300
You said pack what I need.

05:04.889 --> 05:08.723
You need clothes, Alice.
Pants, shirts, socks.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.676
And how many times
have you read
Alice in Wonderland?

05:15.274 --> 05:16.980
(SIGHS)

05:17.067 --> 05:21.857
I wanna go home,
Banana, and so do you.
Prom is coming.

05:24.033 --> 05:27.992
The doctor told Mom and Dad
that this place is gonna
make my nightmares go away.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.488
No more screaming?

05:32.041 --> 05:34.157
But what I have
is genetic,

05:34.251 --> 05:37.618
so we all need
to deal with it,
the entire family.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.922
Who snuck you out
to see Sleeping Beauty?

05:42.009 --> 05:45.877
And who gave Jackie Jacobs
an Indian burn when
she stole your barrette?

05:49.475 --> 05:52.888
I'll always be there
for you, I promise.

05:53.771 --> 05:55.932
But I need you
to be there for me, too.

05:59.735 --> 06:01.191

gonna be fine.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.285
PETER: Mom?

06:16.377 --> 06:20.290
My sister, my parents,
they all died here.

06:20.798 --> 06:24.461
And ifwe don't come
together, ifwe don't
settle our differences,

06:25.761 --> 06:28.628
I'm afraid
history is going
to repeat itself.

06:53.914 --> 06:58.658
1961 was a different time.
Kennedy was president.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.413
We were all patriots.

07:01.505 --> 07:05.043
When the government
found out about us, they
told us they could cure us,

07:05.134 --> 07:06.965
and we believed them.

07:08.012 --> 07:11.004
And they rounded us all up,
and they put us here.

07:11.807 --> 07:13.343
What happened here?

07:13.434 --> 07:19.680
I don't know. I was lucky,
I survived, but Alice,
my entire family, didn't.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.732
So, why are we here, Mom?
You could have told us
this in a restaurant.

07:23.819 --> 07:26.060
Why here?
Why are we digging
up those bodies?

07:27.281 --> 07:29.613
I've been dreaming
about my sister.

07:32.036 --> 07:33.151
Alive.

07:34.038 --> 07:36.780
That doesn't make sense,
but my dreams often don't.

07:36.874 --> 07:39.160
They're open
to interpretation.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.993
They're confusing,
but I think, I think

07:43.464 --> 07:45.125
l have to see her
for myself.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.467
l have to find her body,
find a piece of clothing.

07:47.551 --> 07:50.258
Something, anything,
to give her
a proper burial.

07:50.346 --> 07:52.632
You should have told us
about this place,

07:53.098 --> 07:54.804
that you had a sister.

07:54.892 --> 07:57.349
I didn't want you
to know the pain. Mothers
are allowed to do that.

07:57.436 --> 07:58.972
I'm allowed
to protect you.

07:59.063 --> 08:01.349
You're absolutely
allowed to do that, Ma.

08:02.274 --> 08:03.810
It's my nightmare, Peter.

08:04.777 --> 08:08.315
I never wanted you
to know what I suffered.
I tried to forget.

08:09.073 --> 08:10.734
We made everyone forget.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.402
Who's "we"?

08:14.244 --> 08:16.326
How do you think
the Company was formed?

08:16.413 --> 08:20.656
It started here,
with a vow to never
let this happen again.

08:20.751 --> 08:25.871
We destroyed files,
erased memories.
We blackmailed, we killed,

08:26.840 --> 08:32.176
anything to keep
our existence secret.
And it worked for 50 years.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.887
Now, Noah and l have
tried to fix this
current situation,

08:35.974 --> 08:39.137
but Mr. Danko has
proved resourceful.

08:40.479 --> 08:42.515
So, that's what
you were trying to do?

08:43.315 --> 08:44.521
Yes.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.065
But you blew it?

08:47.861 --> 08:48.976
Yeah.

08:49.697 --> 08:53.281
The important thing is
to put our secret back,

08:53.367 --> 08:56.655
so we can all stop running,
return to our lives.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.745
It's time to go back
to the old methods.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.948
You mean erasing people's
memories and killing?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.453
It's a necessary evil.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.503
I'm sorry about
what happened here, Mom,

09:08.424 --> 09:11.131
but it didn't give you
the right to do the things
that you've done,

09:11.218 --> 09:12.924
and it still doesn't.

09:13.846 --> 09:15.336
We need you, Peter.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.971
I need you.
The Company tore
this family apart.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.970
I'm not gonna be
a part of it again.

Look, I heard you
talking to your sister,

09:45.210 --> 09:47.075
about how your nightmares
come true.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.041
Look, you're not
the only one
who's realized

09:50.132 --> 09:52.293
there's something strange
happening to them.

I don't know what
you're talking about.

They're gonna
make us normal.
And you're blind.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.627
Why do you think
they have armed guards?

10:27.711 --> 10:31.249
We've done nothing wrong.
It's not like
we're communists.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.750
My dad said
we can trust them.

10:32.841 --> 10:36.425
This has happened before.

10:36.512 --> 10:38.844

This is different.
We're different.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.929

10:46.897 --> 10:48.637
My dreams are confusing.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.481
They're not always right.

10:52.736 --> 10:57.571
You have to stop
being afraid
and start believing.

I heard what you
were saying to the boys,
about Dr. Suresh.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.502
Those boys just have
an overactive imagination.

12:02.556 --> 12:08.017

away the TV and dessert.

to get back inside.

Pete, we need
to get through whatever
it is that's between us,

and you're not helping
by running away every time
things get a bit tough.

Running away?
So, when you just
up and disappear,

15:21.880 --> 15:25.168
you go wherever it is
that you went, instead
of staying in Washington

and dealing
with the problem
that you created...

Yeah.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.347
How Dad had two tickets
to the World Series,

15:41.441 --> 15:44.524
that he had two other
tickets to the playoffs,

and you convinced me
to go to the playoffs
with him.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.362
I wanted to make sure
you got to see a game, yeah.

15:51.827 --> 15:54.284
Come on, Pete.
I couldn't have known the Mets
were gonna beat the Astros.

15:54.371 --> 15:58.831
