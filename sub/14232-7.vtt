( groaning )
Yes! Yes!
Now somebody
grab the wand!

01:02.730 --> 01:03.796
Lobster claws, you!

01:03.798 --> 01:06.598
Oh, yeah!
I got this.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.934
Go, red boy.
Go, red boy.

01:08.936 --> 01:14.339
Go, red boy!
Stop flexing your thorax
and get it already!

01:14.341 --> 01:17.042
This is happening now!

01:23.617 --> 01:24.616
What the--

01:24.618 --> 01:25.617
( gasping )

01:25.619 --> 01:28.320
You got clawed.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.355
Eww.

Ooohh.

01:40.601 --> 01:44.336
I love cupcakes!
Ahh! ( crying )

01:44.338 --> 01:45.737
Ahhh!

01:45.739 --> 01:47.739
<i>Uhhh!</i>
<i>Uhhhh.</i>

01:47.741 --> 01:49.308
( sighing )

01:49.310 --> 01:52.244
That was fun!
But we gotta go to school.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.213
Oh, you're
on my backpack.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.648
Here.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.151
All right, morons.

01:59.153 --> 02:01.453
Walk of shame.
You know the drill.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.921
( all wincing )

02:02.923 --> 02:05.190
Quit crying and
rub some dirt on it.

02:05.192 --> 02:06.792
Wh-wh-whoa.
Who-whoa.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.393
Where do you think
you're going, hm?

02:08.395 --> 02:12.197
Uh, back home.
To celebrate how close
we came with my bros.

02:12.199 --> 02:13.999
After that performance?

02:14.001 --> 02:17.102
You, sir, are a steaming pile
of monster garbage.

02:17.104 --> 02:20.973
( hysterical )
And you're fired!

02:20.975 --> 02:22.941
Ha ha ha!
Good one!

02:22.943 --> 02:25.010
You really had me going,
boss.

02:25.012 --> 02:28.847
Ugh, you're even bad
at getting fired!

02:28.849 --> 02:31.150
I can't believe
I was friends with him.
<i>What a loser.</i>

that kite monster

02:47.334 --> 02:49.735
with his electric
lightning powers?

02:49.737 --> 02:53.138
Like, whoa.
( laughs weakly )
Yeah. That's not
what happened.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.206
Hey, look.

02:55.742 --> 02:58.310
Ahhh!

02:58.312 --> 03:02.014
You want seconds
on those cupcakes?!

03:02.016 --> 03:04.850
Um, this is the part
where you fight back.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.152
( sobbing )
Go ahead!

03:07.154 --> 03:08.954
Blast me!
Do it!

03:08.956 --> 03:10.289
( yelps )

03:10.291 --> 03:11.890
Um. Are you okay?

03:11.892 --> 03:15.127
Well, uh, the thing is...
( sobbing )

03:15.129 --> 03:18.931
Master Ludo fired me.

03:18.933 --> 03:22.100
I can never show my face
on Mewni again.

03:22.102 --> 03:25.137
Oh, man.
He's taking
this really hard.

03:25.139 --> 03:27.272
This is probably
just a monster trick.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.775
I don't think
he's faking it.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.810
We should do something.
Like what?

03:31.812 --> 03:35.280
I don't know.
But we can't just
leave him like this.

03:35.282 --> 03:36.782
Marco,
why do you even care?

03:36.784 --> 03:39.117
He's a monster!

03:39.119 --> 03:40.152
( squirrels chittering )

03:40.154 --> 03:42.087
Ahhhh!

03:42.089 --> 03:44.122
Monsters
are the bad guys.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.325
I don't have to be bad.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.293
In fact, I've always
secretly wanted to be good.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.394
Really?

03:49.396 --> 03:51.263
Well, maybe
we can show you how.

03:51.265 --> 03:52.931
What?
That's crazy!

03:52.933 --> 03:56.335
Monsters...are...evil!

03:56.337 --> 03:57.402
It's just their nature.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.204
No, it's not!
Look!

03:59.206 --> 04:00.305
( squirrel whimpering
like a dog )

04:00.307 --> 04:01.873
See?

04:01.875 --> 04:04.943
Yeah. ( gulps )
See?

04:06.112 --> 04:08.981
( squirrel chittering )
Okay, lobster claws.

04:08.983 --> 04:13.352
The key to being good is
"Do unto others as you'd
have them do to you."

04:13.354 --> 04:14.853
( grunts )
(    <i>screaming )</i>

04:14.855 --> 04:16.188
Like that?

04:16.190 --> 04:18.090
Actually, that's
100 percent wrong.

04:18.092 --> 04:19.258
You want to do
the opposite.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.259
Now say you're sorry.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.860
That's all right!

04:21.862 --> 04:23.428
I landed on a sprinkler!

04:23.430 --> 04:27.466
This is too hard.
I'm never gonna get this.

04:27.468 --> 04:30.168
Yeah.
You should just give up.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.204
( laughing ) Okay.
Don't listen to her.

04:32.206 --> 04:34.806
Uh, the next time you get
the urge to punch somebody,

04:34.808 --> 04:38.176
just imagine how it would
feel if it happened to you.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.180
I got the urge!!

04:42.182 --> 04:45.450
Wow, that totally
would've hurt.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.952
(   <i>sobbing )</i>

04:46.954 --> 04:50.022
( sobbing )
Aww, what's wrong?

04:50.024 --> 04:53.859
My kitty's stuck
in the twee.
( purrs )

04:53.861 --> 04:57.929
Lobster claws,
this is your chance.

04:57.931 --> 05:01.066
Careful with
my Mr. Mittens!

05:01.068 --> 05:03.535
Ta-da!

05:03.537 --> 05:07.105
Thank you so much,
Mr. Lobster Man!

05:07.107 --> 05:08.373
I knew there
was some good in him.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.242
( cat screeching )

05:10.244 --> 05:12.144
( yelps )
( gagging )

05:12.146 --> 05:14.279
( mews )
Now do you see what
we're dealing with?

05:14.281 --> 05:17.282
Mr. Mittens is fine.
No harm, no fou--

05:17.284 --> 05:19.117
( girl's muffled screams )
( yells )

05:19.119 --> 05:20.952
Okay,
that was my fault.

05:20.954 --> 05:24.523
I assumed you knew
this but...
you can't eat children.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.325
Really?
Not even annoying ones?

05:26.327 --> 05:28.260
Never!
WOMAN:  <i>Help! Help!</i>

05:28.262 --> 05:32.164
Help me!
My baby is still inside!

05:32.166 --> 05:33.365
MARCO AND STAR:
Your baby?

05:33.367 --> 05:36.168
Don't worry.
Red boy's got this.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.237
Wait!
And I'm totally
not gonna eat it!

05:40.206 --> 05:42.507
Cotton Candy
Fire Extinguish!

05:45.144 --> 05:49.147
My baby!
Oh, my baby,
my sweet baby...

05:49.149 --> 05:51.350
( minor notes )
...grand piano.

05:51.352 --> 05:54.453

Are you scared?
Tell me what you're feeling.

05:58.092 --> 06:00.625
I was wondering
where that piano music
was coming from.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.694
Um...
Where's lobster claws?

06:08.068 --> 06:11.103
Well, he's not eating humans,
that's a step forward.

06:16.175 --> 06:17.309
Okay,
here's an easy one.

06:17.311 --> 06:20.045
Help the old lady
cross the street.

06:20.047 --> 06:23.115
( scurrying )
I'll help you, miss.

06:23.117 --> 06:24.583
I'd say he's starting
to get this.

06:24.585 --> 06:27.953
Well, I'm not taking
my eyes off him for one sec--

06:27.955 --> 06:29.054
BOTH:
Ahhh!

06:29.056 --> 06:32.124
Ahh!
Where's a sprinkler?!

NEWSCASTER:  <i>Tragedy today</i>

06:52.146 --> 06:54.646
( laughing weakly )
Yeah, you know how
the news sensationalizes
things.

06:54.648 --> 06:57.015
I still believe
you can be good.

06:57.017 --> 07:00.051
But until then,
I'm gonna find some
rubber bands for your claws.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.386

MARCO: Save it.

07:01.388 --> 07:05.590
Why is being
good so hard?

07:05.592 --> 07:09.227
The problem is Marco
is trying to make you
something you're not.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.363
You're a vile,
repulsive monster.

07:11.365 --> 07:12.397
Why fight it?

07:12.399 --> 07:15.133
Yeah. I am repulsive.

07:15.135 --> 07:18.136
I shouldn't be
helping humans,
I should be hurting them.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.504
You, in particular.

07:19.506 --> 07:22.307
And I wish I could
just get back
to smashing your face!

07:22.309 --> 07:25.644
Maybe there's a way
we can both get what we want.

Shh.

07:49.602 --> 07:53.205
Ludo!
I was just dreaming
about kicking your butt.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.540
I couldn't find
any giant rubber bands,

07:55.542 --> 07:58.343
but...teddy bear mittens!

07:58.345 --> 08:00.045
Guys?

08:03.683 --> 08:04.683
Star!!

08:09.088 --> 08:10.722
They're back?
Yeah.
I lured them here.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.757
To get lobster claws
his old job back.

08:12.759 --> 08:15.360
I'm gonna let him
beat me up. Play along.

08:15.362 --> 08:17.295
( screams )
What?
That's crazy!

08:17.297 --> 08:21.099
All right, Ludo,
I got more than
cupcakes this time!

08:21.101 --> 08:24.769
Uhh, I said, "I got more
than cupcakes this time."

08:24.771 --> 08:27.539
Go, red boy!

08:27.541 --> 08:29.608
Ahh!
Boo-yah, ka-sha!

08:29.610 --> 08:32.143
Don't worry, boss.
I got this.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.012
Raahhh!!
Boss?

08:34.014 --> 08:36.214

Pew pew pew! Zing!
Ahh! Ahh!

LOBSTER CLAWS:
Ahh! Ahh!

08:43.757 --> 08:45.357
You know,
he has gotten way better.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.425
Very impressed.
( gibberish  )

08:47.427 --> 08:50.028
Yes. Yes. I do see
marked improvement.

08:50.030 --> 08:55.100
But I'd really
be impressed if you would
just grab the wand!

08:55.102 --> 08:58.036
He's defeated me!

08:58.038 --> 08:59.738
Ahhhh!!

08:59.740 --> 09:01.139
Hey!

09:01.141 --> 09:02.607
Yeeesss!
( laughs )

09:02.609 --> 09:05.043
Ahh!
Wahhh!

09:11.784 --> 09:16.154

What's happening
to me?

09:18.124 --> 09:22.127
( growling )

09:23.696 --> 09:25.564
Oh, not again!

09:25.566 --> 09:30.602
Being bad feels
so good.

09:30.604 --> 09:31.603
How could you do this?

09:31.605 --> 09:33.738
I was trying
to help you!

09:33.740 --> 09:36.474
( growling )

09:36.476 --> 09:38.109
Whoa.

09:38.111 --> 09:41.680
Don't listen to her.
She's the enemy!

09:41.682 --> 09:45.383
No, I saw the good
in you! Don't do it!

09:45.385 --> 09:49.821
Act like a monster
and give it to me!

09:49.823 --> 09:53.124
Lobster claws, please!

09:53.126 --> 09:55.393

Hii...yah!

Ahh!
I always forget
about that karate boy!

Daisy Devastation!

10:15.781 --> 10:16.848

10:17.817 --> 10:20.185
Retreat!

10:20.187 --> 10:23.188
Wh-wh-wh-whoa.
You.

10:23.190 --> 10:27.692
You had the wand
in the palm of your claws!

10:27.694 --> 10:30.762
What did it feel like?
It kind of tingled.

10:30.764 --> 10:34.799
I knew it!
I'm so jealous.
Can I touch your claws?

10:34.801 --> 10:37.736
( gushing )
Nice!

10:37.738 --> 10:40.138
After you.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.473
Don't do it, lobster claws!

10:41.475 --> 10:43.508
What about wanting
to be good?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.678
LUDO:
That's my monster!

10:46.680 --> 10:48.780
Ahh. Marco.
You were right.

10:48.782 --> 10:51.416
There was some good
in him, after all.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.586
Not much.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.893
( yawns )

11:02.962 --> 11:04.629
( squawks )
Wha--?

11:04.631 --> 11:06.931
( all squawking )

11:06.933 --> 11:09.601
Huh?
( jungle noises )

11:09.603 --> 11:12.771
Wow, Star's getting
better at her magic.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.572
This is really peaceful.

11:14.574 --> 11:15.807
( creature roaring )
Ahh!!

11:15.809 --> 11:17.909
Help! Ahh!
( creature growling )

11:17.911 --> 11:20.679
Mega Explosive
Crystal Laser!

11:22.648 --> 11:23.815
( screeching
like a cat )

11:23.817 --> 11:24.949
Here, kitty kitty.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.386
( gasping )
Thanks for saving me.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.756
Again, that makes it
28 saves for you,

11:31.758 --> 11:36.761
and four for me,
but... ( laughs )
Who's counting?

11:36.763 --> 11:42.267
Wow, Marco.
I just love what
you've done with the place.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.401
( squawking )

11:43.403 --> 11:45.770
Aw, so cute.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.906
( laughing )
What? I didn't do this.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.842
Well, somebody did.
Somebody?

11:50.844 --> 11:54.379
Birds and rainbows and...
whatever that is.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.414
'Sup?
This has to be you.

11:56.416 --> 11:59.284
Sorry, it wasn't me.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.021
Eh, looks more
like your dad's work.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.989
This was my work.

12:04.991 --> 12:08.993
Ha ha ha ha!
But the rest of this, no.

12:11.230 --> 12:14.299
MARCO:
( snoring )

12:16.435 --> 12:17.635
Huh?!

12:23.576 --> 12:26.611
( gasping )
( shooting off lasers )

12:26.613 --> 12:28.246
N-N-N-No.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.314
( gibberish )

12:29.316 --> 12:31.449
( yelps )

12:31.451 --> 12:33.318
Star?
What are you doing?

12:33.320 --> 12:35.320
( hissing gibberish )

12:37.256 --> 12:40.425
Ahhh! Okay. Oh,
whoa whoa.
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Playing messages.

12:40.427 --> 12:45.764
Star. Just calling
with your daily reminder
to behave like the queen-
in-training that you are.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.732
Paper. Tornado.

12:47.734 --> 12:50.301
What?
( screaming )

12:50.303 --> 12:51.903
Ow. Star!
Wake up!

12:51.905 --> 12:56.407
Beanbag. Monster.
Metamorphosis.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.642
( growling )

12:57.644 --> 12:59.444
( roaring )
( yelling )

12:59.446 --> 13:00.445
Star!

13:00.447 --> 13:01.813
( yawning )

13:01.815 --> 13:03.681
Morning, Marco.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.683
Morning,
beanbag chair monster.

13:05.685 --> 13:08.686
Marco! Lightning
to the rescue!

13:08.688 --> 13:11.489
Ahh! Ughh.
( sighs )

13:11.491 --> 13:13.291
( heavy sigh )
You saved me.

13:13.293 --> 13:17.362
That's, uh, 29 to 4.

13:17.364 --> 13:20.965
( snoring )
What happened?

13:20.967 --> 13:23.334
You were spelling
in your sleep!

13:23.336 --> 13:25.403
( battle cry )

13:25.405 --> 13:28.740
That must be why
you don't remember turning
our living room into a jungle.

13:28.742 --> 13:31.309
Oh, no, you gotta fix me,
Diaz.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.879
( inhaling )
Now's my chance
to save you.

13:34.881 --> 13:37.315
With psychology!

13:37.317 --> 13:38.650
Psychology?

13:38.652 --> 13:44.956
Psychology.
Yeah.
Psychology.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.424
What is it?

13:46.426 --> 13:48.993
Psychology is like karate
for your mind.

13:48.995 --> 13:52.564
I'm gonna dig deep
in your brain to see
what makes you tick.

13:52.566 --> 13:56.668
Ohh. Yeah, we have
something like that on Mewni.

13:56.670 --> 13:57.902
( screaming )

13:57.904 --> 14:01.039
Yeah, this
is pretty different.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.874
Now, before we start,

14:02.876 --> 14:05.643
I must transform myself.
Transform?

14:05.645 --> 14:08.513
Ahhh.
Glasses. Paper.

14:08.515 --> 14:12.650
Clothes. Book.
Dr. Marco, Ph.D.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.853
What does Ph.D. stand for?

14:14.855 --> 14:16.621
Pretty handsome dude.

14:16.623 --> 14:19.023
Mom! Go back to bed.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.526
All right,
Miss Butterfly.

14:21.528 --> 14:26.698
I'm going to administer
a series of psychological tests
to uncover what's bothering you.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.500
Oooh. Tests.
Sounds fun!

14:29.502 --> 14:30.602
Oh, wait, no it doesn't.

14:30.604 --> 14:32.837
Test number one.
Role playing.

14:32.839 --> 14:35.840
I want you to pretend
to be someone close to you.

14:35.842 --> 14:39.644
Hi, I'm Marco.
My skinny jeans are awesome!

14:39.646 --> 14:41.880
Ooh, here comes
Jacquelyn Thomas!

14:41.882 --> 14:44.115
I'm gonna impress her
with my karate.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.516
I got this cute
little mole.

14:45.518 --> 14:46.885
( exasperated sigh )

14:48.420 --> 14:50.488
Test number two.
Art therapy.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.124
Paint me a picture
of your childhood.

14:54.526 --> 14:57.662
Mmmm. Such depth.
So many symbols.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.898
What does it say
about your childhood?

14:59.900 --> 15:02.634
I was just drawing
unicorns and monsters
'cause they're cool.

15:02.636 --> 15:05.570
Rawr! Egh! Rawr!
Test three!

15:05.572 --> 15:06.905
Ink blot test.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.840
Tell me what you see
on this paper.

15:08.842 --> 15:10.508
An ink blot!
I win!

15:10.510 --> 15:13.745
Okay, no no no.
What does this
remind you of?

15:13.747 --> 15:14.879
A fat porcupine.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.681
Oh, yes,
that's good.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.584
What about this one?
A little alien guy
in a gnome cap.

15:19.586 --> 15:24.422
( gasps )
Maybe I'm sleep-spelling
because I'm secretly a little
alien guy in a gnome cap.

15:24.424 --> 15:29.093
No. Now what about--
ugh, wait. Hold on,
this is a mistake.
( gasps )

15:29.095 --> 15:31.529
That reminds me
of my overbearing mother
suffocating me

15:31.531 --> 15:34.532
with all the duties
of becoming a queen
for the rest of my life.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.770
I think we may have found
the root of your problem.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.772
You have mother issues!

15:40.774 --> 15:43.007
Yay! I have Mother Issues.

15:43.009 --> 15:46.511
No, that's bad.
Aww.
I have mother issues.

15:46.513 --> 15:50.448
It's okay, Star.
Identifying the problem
is the first step to recovery.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.717
Recovery.

15:56.055 --> 15:57.121
( yelps )

16:00.459 --> 16:01.993
( snoring )

16:03.662 --> 16:07.065
Aw, man.
STAR:  <i>Get away!</i>

16:07.067 --> 16:09.033
( grunting )
Huh?

16:09.035 --> 16:10.601
( yawning )

16:10.603 --> 16:14.605
Wait. What the--?
Ahh! Oof. Ahh!

16:14.607 --> 16:16.507
Undy pants?
Oh, no.

16:16.509 --> 16:17.475
Marco's naked.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.010
No,
I'm in my jam jams.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.912
Look.

16:20.914 --> 16:22.146
I want your face!

16:22.148 --> 16:24.082
Ugh, you weren't
sleep-spelling,

16:24.084 --> 16:25.516
you were just
defending yourself

16:25.518 --> 16:28.186
against that
sleep-goblin-elephant.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.221
Wow! I'm hardcore.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.823
I came here
for your face!

16:31.825 --> 16:33.758
To steal your face!

16:33.760 --> 16:35.226
You hurt me
in my butt!

16:36.562 --> 16:37.729
( shuddering )
Ew.

16:37.731 --> 16:39.697
Could you...
stop yelling?

16:39.699 --> 16:43.835
Well, I'm sorry.
I don't have any ears.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.537
Camera phone.
( clicks )

16:46.539 --> 16:48.873
I'm on the run
from St. O's.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.241
Well, you can't stay here.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.843
I don't want
to go to St. O's!

16:51.845 --> 16:53.878
Oh, you're going
to St. O's.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.247
You see,
we're both big girls.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.716
We got the same
highs and lows,

16:58.718 --> 17:02.353
the same east and west.
You can hardly tell us apart.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.322
Except for
in the face.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.224
Camera phone.

17:06.226 --> 17:10.061
So I'm gonna laser finger
your face off of your head.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.929
Oh, you can have my face.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.564
See, I'm gonna wear
your face

17:13.566 --> 17:16.267
and then you can go to jail.
'Cause you look like me.

17:16.269 --> 17:20.638
It's just a classic
face-switch scenario.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.076
( guffawing )

17:25.078 --> 17:28.279
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that is the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.247
It is not funny.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.315
( screams )
Star!

17:31.317 --> 17:33.718
Don't worry, Star.
I'll save you!

17:35.220 --> 17:37.789
Whoaaa! Ughh.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.997
Ahem.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.131
( laughs nervously )

17:50.903 --> 17:52.804
Camera phone.

17:54.206 --> 17:56.074
Ahhh!

17:56.076 --> 17:57.842
Nose grab.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.649
( evil laugh )
MARCO: Stop!

18:04.651 --> 18:07.285
Whoaaa.
Ahhh.
Be careful on this roof.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.954
It is slippery
from the evening dew.

18:09.956 --> 18:11.689
Let me go,
you weirdy weirdo!

18:11.691 --> 18:13.357
Is Marco small?

18:13.359 --> 18:15.760
Or is he just really
far away? I can't tell.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.328
Laser finger.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.763
( screaming )
Marco!

18:18.765 --> 18:19.764
Nooo!

18:19.766 --> 18:21.833
( grunting )
Whoa. Unhh.

18:23.635 --> 18:25.803
Glasses. Paper.
Clothes.

18:25.805 --> 18:29.107
Book. Dr. Marco, Ph.D.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.241
You don't have
to do this.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.043
I have an 'A'
in psychology.

18:32.045 --> 18:33.644
I can help you.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.613
No, thank you.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.815
Use your mind karate!

18:37.817 --> 18:39.250
Listen to me.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.919
I already told you.
I don't have any ears.

18:41.921 --> 18:45.723
Well, maybe that's why
you're in this mess.

18:45.725 --> 18:50.294
( sad music )
Okay, I do have ears.
But I don't use them

18:50.296 --> 18:52.130
to listen to people.

18:52.132 --> 18:55.733
The only people
I listen to is my mind.

18:55.735 --> 19:00.905
And right now,
my mind is telling me
to steal her face.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.174
But you can't keep
running from your problems.

19:03.176 --> 19:05.276
When you steal
other people's faces,

19:05.278 --> 19:09.180
all you're really
stealing is your future.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.016
But I like my future.

19:16.421 --> 19:19.657
I don't like my future.
Camera phone.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.325
( laughing )

19:28.167 --> 19:29.800
( growling )

19:29.802 --> 19:32.170
( screaming )
Ahhh!

19:35.707 --> 19:39.777
Wow, Marco.
You really saved my face.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.280
Yes!
Finally.

19:42.282 --> 19:47.351
I don't get it.
Why is this tally thing
such a big deal to you?

19:47.353 --> 19:50.087
Uhhh...I don't know.

19:50.089 --> 19:54.258
I guess... you're
this magic princess
from another dimension

19:54.260 --> 19:59.096
and I'm just...
( clears throat )

19:59.098 --> 20:03.234
Star, Ph.D. Marco,
you are awesome.

20:03.236 --> 20:06.170
We don't need to get
caught up in who saves who.

20:06.172 --> 20:10.007
All that matters
is that we have
each other's back.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.909
Yeah.
But this time,

20:11.911 --> 20:14.378
I totally saved you.
Woohoo!

20:14.380 --> 20:16.280
Whoa.

20:16.282 --> 20:19.317
You're right.
We shouldn't keep
track anymore.
