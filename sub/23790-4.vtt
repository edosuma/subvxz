Nice.

So, I was thinking.
Well... we were thinking.

01:10.653 --> 01:13.907
Maybe all of the unfortunate things
that have happened recently

01:13.990 --> 01:15.742
are actually good things.

01:16.367 --> 01:19.746
No offense, but why spend
all this time rehearsing a play

01:19.829 --> 01:22.123
that people can only watch once?

01:22.207 --> 01:24.209

that thousands of actors
have already played?

01:40.350 --> 01:43.812
We make a movie that you guys star in.

-[Jessica] Right.

01:48.399 --> 01:51.569
You guys saw the music video he made?
It was embarrassing.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.989
Well, that's because the three of us,
we're terrible actors.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.909
If we had real actors,
we could make something cool.

I just assume he's grounded.

she'd be grounded for a month, maybe two.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.186

04:02.325 --> 04:07.247
Unfortunately, most of the attention I get
comes from passengers in first class,

to go to the mile-high club.

Is that a frequent flier thing?

04:42.448 --> 04:43.283
[laughs]

04:43.616 --> 04:46.244
And so, even though
it's gonna be set in the future,

04:46.327 --> 04:48.329
it's gonna feel like a...

04:49.664 --> 04:52.542
like a bad science fiction movie
from the 1950s.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.127
And I know what you're thinking,

04:54.627 --> 04:56.337
that we're gonna make
a deliberately bad movie.

04:56.421 --> 04:59.674
No. It's gonna be, like, accidentally bad.

-It's very complicated, intricate.
-...three, two...

05:19.485 --> 05:21.487
-[Luke] I don't know.
-It's an alien invasion movie.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.452
Totally.

05:27.785 --> 05:32.123
Totally. Yeah. Alien invasion.
Like, um...<i> Independence Day.</i>

05:32.623 --> 05:37.795
Right. And there's this
super-secret service-type, astronaut guy.

05:37.879 --> 05:41.257
And he has to save
the President of the United States.

05:41.924 --> 05:44.010
[clears throat] Who plays the President?

05:44.093 --> 05:45.845
[Kate] Um, a woman.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.847
The President's a woman.

05:47.930 --> 05:52.101
And he doesn't just save her, though.
He has to save everyone from the aliens.

05:52.185 --> 05:56.230
There's this big space battle at the end.
And a smaller one in the middle.

05:56.314 --> 05:59.150
Ooh! And there's this bad guy
space commander dude.

05:59.233 --> 06:02.445
It's like really complex
and three-dimensional, Oliver.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.238
-Does he die?
-No?

06:04.322 --> 06:06.574
-He should die.
-Okay, great. He dies.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.910
[Emaline] Barf!

06:09.702 --> 06:14.207
Sounds like another
stupid action movie to me.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.376
[Kate] Well, there's one more thing.

06:18.044 --> 06:22.965
Our hero, even though he wants
to save all of humanity from the aliens,

06:23.549 --> 06:24.384
he can't...

06:25.676 --> 06:26.844
because he's in love.

06:28.846 --> 06:30.431
[Luke] With one of the aliens.

06:34.143 --> 06:38.815
So, even though it has
this sci-fi look, really--

06:38.898 --> 06:40.775
It's a love story...

06:42.360 --> 06:43.402
in space.

06:43.486 --> 06:46.906
It's like, uh... like<i> Romeo and Juliet,</i>

06:46.989 --> 06:49.659
just except they don't die.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.994
They live happily ever after.

06:52.870 --> 06:58.501
Well, sounds ambitious, but talk is cheap.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.630
How do I know that you are
going to be able to pull this off?

07:04.507 --> 07:05.675
You don't.

07:07.426 --> 07:09.303
I guess you'll have to trust me.

07:09.804 --> 07:10.847
Yes, I would.

07:12.557 --> 07:16.018
But I don't trust anyone
I haven't had a drink with.

07:19.397 --> 07:20.648
Start drinking.

07:20.731 --> 07:21.899

-[Sherry] Oh, boy.
-Every last drop counts.

And... <i>fini!</i>

07:27.947 --> 07:29.198
[laughing]

07:30.825 --> 07:32.577
Can I admit one thing?

07:32.660 --> 07:34.370
Okay, but just one.

07:34.454 --> 07:40.334
Look, I know that what
Luke confessed to was bad,

07:40.418 --> 07:44.755
but, um... I was kinda proud of him
for getting in trouble.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.966
-Oh!
-[both laughing]

07:47.049 --> 07:50.219
-That's a new one.
-Yeah. Kids need to mess up, right?

07:50.303 --> 07:53.431
It builds character. It teaches lessons.

07:54.474 --> 07:59.479
As the Principal of Boring High, I--

07:59.562 --> 08:02.273
-[laughs]
-Well, my position is I disagree.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.152
But as a human being...

08:07.153 --> 08:08.070
absolutely.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.489
-Thank you.
-Yes!

08:09.572 --> 08:11.032
[laughing]

08:11.115 --> 08:13.451
I bet you never got in trouble
when you were a kid.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.744
Oh...

08:14.827 --> 08:15.953
No.

08:16.829 --> 08:17.997
Never.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.082
Huh. I was always very good.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.709
I wasn't.

08:22.043 --> 08:26.881
But I had Luke when I was in high school,
and that straightened me out pretty quick.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.178
Is there anything you wish you did?

08:33.804 --> 08:34.931
Like what? [chuckles]

08:35.014 --> 08:36.974

08:37.058 --> 08:38.893

08:39.810 --> 08:41.687
Mm. [clears throat] Not really.

08:45.650 --> 08:46.859

Never.

I got your trust now?

09:38.369 --> 09:41.664

you mind me saying something?

10:52.026 --> 10:53.653
Of course not, Dylan. What?

10:53.736 --> 10:57.615
It's just that,
all those times I f'd up in school.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.076
All those times
I should have been expelled,

11:00.159 --> 11:02.578
and you sat me down
and talked straight shit.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.915
-You don't have to get into any of that.
-I was a dumb-ass.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.793
Most people in your position
would've bounced me,

11:08.876 --> 11:10.920
but you took the time.

11:11.420 --> 11:15.383
You talked me through it.
I wouldn't have graduated if not for you.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.259
And look at me now.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.763
And I'm not being ironic.

11:21.138 --> 11:22.598
The way I see it,

11:23.099 --> 11:25.142
one day you're slinging hot dogs
and butt wipes,

11:25.726 --> 11:27.436
and the next day, you run the place.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.271
That's because of you.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.857
Well, thank you, Dylan.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.360
No. Thank you, Mr. M.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.198
How much do I owe you?

11:39.615 --> 11:43.285
[chuckles] Wow. You kinda changed
Dylan Barker's life, Mr. M.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.495
No.

11:44.578 --> 11:45.788
Yeah, you did.

11:45.871 --> 11:50.709
You motivate those kids.
Motivate them to get their lives in order.

11:50.793 --> 11:51.877
I suppose.

11:51.961 --> 11:56.048
While I motivate people
to, um, stow their tray tables

11:56.132 --> 11:58.884
and put their seats
in the upright position.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.553
No, you do more than that.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.055
You hand out peanuts.

12:03.639 --> 12:06.350
[chuckles] And those little bags
that are impossible to open.

12:07.184 --> 12:10.855
-Sorry. No, I--
-[laughs] Yeah. I'm just kidding.

12:10.938 --> 12:15.359
It's okay.
I just think it's pretty sweet.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.532
You ready?

Ken!

13:27.723 --> 13:29.183
I can see your car.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.435
Oh!

13:32.102 --> 13:33.604
[woman] Seriously?

13:35.397 --> 13:36.440
Very mature!

13:36.524 --> 13:37.525
[laughs]

13:38.526 --> 13:40.361
[woman] I can hear you!

13:43.614 --> 13:45.157
I'm going to sleep.

13:46.659 --> 13:50.621
This had better be gone in the morning,
or so help me...

13:56.669 --> 13:57.878
[door closes]

13:59.630 --> 14:00.798
So...

14:01.757 --> 14:03.342
we went out a few times.

14:03.425 --> 14:04.927
[laughing]

14:07.346 --> 14:10.975
And the aliens will have blue faces!

14:11.058 --> 14:15.396
Now, I know what everybody's thinking,
"Luke, aliens are always green!"

14:15.813 --> 14:18.357
Not ours! Ours will be blue.

14:18.941 --> 14:22.903
Oh, and we'll shoot it at Dominguez Rocks!

14:22.987 --> 14:25.656
And what is Dominguez Rocks?

14:27.575 --> 14:29.743
You've never been to Dominguez Rocks?

14:30.703 --> 14:34.582
Neither have I. It's in California.
I have a poster of it in my room!

14:34.665 --> 14:37.418
It's been
in so many classic sci-fi flicks.

14:37.501 --> 14:39.753
It's these rocks.
They're all colorful and stuff.

14:39.837 --> 14:43.883
And it totally looks like another planet.
Mm-hmm.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.760
Oh, wait. I have an announcement.
I have an announcement, okay?

14:46.844 --> 14:51.265
I wanna give it up to one special person
and that is my girlfriend Kate.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.476
She helped me come up
with this entire thing.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.230
My girlfriend is the greatest!

14:59.064 --> 15:00.733
[applause]

15:00.816 --> 15:02.651
Give it up for Kate, everybody.

15:03.694 --> 15:05.154
[Luke] I want another Zima.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.490
-Come with me.
-[Luke] Whoo!

15:08.574 --> 15:12.077
Yes! Whoo! Zima. Whoo!

15:12.161 --> 15:13.537
Everybody sing along.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.049
How long you known this kid?

15:26.133 --> 15:27.217
Luke?

15:27.301 --> 15:30.095
Um, pretty much forever.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.182
What's his deal?

15:33.724 --> 15:35.392
H-His deal?

15:36.477 --> 15:41.231
Yeah, his deal. Is he Meisner?
Is he Stanislavsky? Come on.

15:42.733 --> 15:47.655
Um, a lil-- a little bit of both.
With some Kevin Smith mixed in.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.074
-Nice.
-Yeah.

15:50.157 --> 15:53.661
We made a movie this summer:
<i>Ace Ventura and the Temple of Gravy.</i>

15:53.744 --> 15:55.454
-It was good.
-It sounds stupid.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.208
Who was Ace?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.961
-I played him, actually.
-You?

16:02.461 --> 16:03.504
[chuckles]

16:04.254 --> 16:07.007
So, then you like Jim Carrey?

16:07.508 --> 16:09.510
He's okay.

16:10.260 --> 16:13.889
Jim Carrey is the most underrated actor
of our time.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.351
Oh, y-yeah. I mean, totally.
He should-- He should win an Oscar.

16:17.434 --> 16:18.852
No, he will.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.980
You think he won't?

16:21.063 --> 16:23.899
-No, no, no, no, I-I think he should.
-He will.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.821
Which one are you, again?

16:28.904 --> 16:29.905
Tyler?

16:29.989 --> 16:31.031
No.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.617
Don't throw it away like that.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.995
It's your name. You only get one of them.

16:36.078 --> 16:39.164
Actually, I have four.
Tyler Edward Randolph Bowen.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.290
So, then say it!

16:40.374 --> 16:41.583

[Oliver exhales]

16:48.757 --> 16:49.883
We'll work on it.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.222
[Luke] Whoo, whoo! All right! [grunts]

17:00.686 --> 17:02.855
[exhales] Spin the bottle, anyone?

17:05.607 --> 17:07.609
[laughing] Tonight was a blast.

17:07.693 --> 17:11.363
Yeah, I think it was one
of the most fun nights of my entire life.

17:11.447 --> 17:12.489
[laughs]

17:16.577 --> 17:18.287
So, thanks for dinner, Ken.

17:18.370 --> 17:19.705
Thank you.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.253
-So...

17:37.931 --> 17:39.224
Okay.

17:42.686 --> 17:43.937
Hey, uh, Ken.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.356
Yeah.

17:47.357 --> 17:50.152
We don't need to tell the kids
about this, right?

17:51.612 --> 17:53.155
There's really nothing to tell.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.365
Totally.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.201
Okay.

17:57.284 --> 17:58.368
Bye.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.542

18:21.850 --> 18:25.104
Rules are whoever it lands on

18:25.187 --> 18:28.524
has to go into the prop closet
for Seven Minutes in Heaven.

18:30.067 --> 18:33.529
No apple-bobbing,
cherry-picking or pumpkin-patching.

18:34.029 --> 18:38.325
Tongue is encouraged, but not required.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.045
Ladies first.

18:52.047 --> 18:53.674
I'm not playing.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.592
If you're here, you're playing.

18:56.718 --> 18:57.970
Unless you're afraid.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.807
We're not afraid.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.022
[Luke] Come on.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.798
Well, well, well.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.012
Ugh.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.763
-Doesn't count.
-Why not?

19:41.847 --> 19:44.057
[Jessica] It's two girls? Doesn't count.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.310
It's fine by me.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.686

Smells like wet dog in here.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.967
I don't mind it. [chuckles]

20:22.679 --> 20:23.722
So...

20:23.805 --> 20:26.516
I should-- I should put on some lip gloss.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.894
-Oh.
-Obviously.

20:29.728 --> 20:30.646
Duh.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.242
I've never kissed a girl.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.078
In case I suck.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.164
S-So, you know why.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.607
Wow.

21:19.069 --> 21:20.237
Wow.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.656
I think I'm a lesbian.
