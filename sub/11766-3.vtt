WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
JULES?

00:02.133 --> 00:03.434
OH, GOOD. IT'S JUST YOU.

00:03.434 --> 00:05.576
WERE YOU NAPPING
UNDER YOUR DESK?

00:05.576 --> 00:07.338
BONNIE AND JERRY
JUST LEFT A MESSAGE

00:07.338 --> 00:10.411
SAYING THEY'RE POPPING IN
TO ASK ME A FAVOR.

00:10.411 --> 00:12.613
THOSE TWO ARE SO ANNOYING.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.185
JULES, YOUR OBLIGATION
TO THE CLIENT ENDS

00:14.185 --> 00:15.786
ONCE THEY MOVE
INTO THE HOUSE.

00:15.786 --> 00:18.419
I KNOW, BUT THEY CALL ME
CONSTANTLY FOR HELP.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.791
TODAY, I'M PUTTING
MY FOOT DOWN.

00:20.791 --> 00:22.193
HELL, YEAH, YOU ARE.

00:22.193 --> 00:23.594
MM.
EXCEPT FOR YOU WON'T.

00:23.594 --> 00:25.196
OKAY, HERE THEY ARE.

00:25.196 --> 00:27.758
(gasps) HEY, JULES!
HI... GRAYSON.

00:27.758 --> 00:29.260
BONNIE.

00:29.260 --> 00:31.432
UH... (stammers)

00:31.432 --> 00:33.104
ALL RIGHT.

00:33.104 --> 00:34.765
JULES, WE CAN'T DECIDE
ON A COLOR FOR THE DEN.

00:34.765 --> 00:37.538
PINE GREEN? FOREST GREEN?
ASPARAGUS?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.039
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
SPARE A DAY

00:39.039 --> 00:41.312
TO GO OVER SOME SWATCHES
WITH US?

00:41.312 --> 00:43.644
(inhales deeply) YOU KNOW,
I DON'T THINK...

00:45.176 --> 00:48.249
I'M DOING ANYTHING TODAY,
SO... SURE.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.520
YOU'RE THE BEST.
OKAY. (chuckles)

00:49.520 --> 00:50.751
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
OKAY.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.523
BYE, GRAYSON.
(Grayson) BYE.

00:54.125 --> 00:55.356
(lowered voice) HELP ME.

00:55.356 --> 00:56.827
(lowered voice) YOU DID THIS
TO YOURSELF.

00:56.827 --> 00:58.489
UGH.

00:58.489 --> 01:03.464
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:03.464 --> 01:07.338
(singsongy) OKAY.
WHO WANTS COOKIES?

01:07.338 --> 01:08.839
AGAIN?
(scoffs)

01:08.839 --> 01:12.072
WE HAVE A FREEZER FULL
OF LAST YEAR'S THIN MINTS.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.504
YOU KNOW,
YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL.

01:13.504 --> 01:15.406
THOSE SALESKIDS ARE
SUPER GOSSIPY.

01:15.406 --> 01:17.148
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

01:17.148 --> 01:18.779
EVERY PRETEEN COOKIE PUSHER
IS GONNA BE STALKING YOU

01:18.779 --> 01:20.411
LIKE I STALKED
MY SEVENTH GRADE BOYFRIEND

01:20.411 --> 01:21.682
AFTER I CAUGHT HIM

01:21.682 --> 01:23.214
TONGUE-STABBING
MY FOSTER SISTER.

01:23.214 --> 01:25.286
IRONICALLY, I PRETENDED
TO SELL COOKIES,

01:25.286 --> 01:27.518
AND THAT'S HOW I GOT
INTO HIS HOUSE.
(door closes)

01:27.518 --> 01:29.089
(whispers) WAH!
JULES, WHY WERE THE COOKIE GIRLS

01:29.089 --> 01:30.721
HIGH-FIVING YOU
AFTER THEY LEFT OUR HOUSE?

01:30.721 --> 01:32.223
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

01:32.223 --> 01:34.465
(gasps) HEY, SEXY!

01:34.465 --> 01:35.696
HOW'D YOU GET YOUR ABS
SO TIGHT?

01:35.696 --> 01:37.128
NICE TRY.

01:37.128 --> 01:38.529
YOU'RE A PUSHOVER.
JUST CAN'T SAY "NO."

01:38.529 --> 01:40.271
AND SINCE YOU'RE ASKING,

01:40.271 --> 01:42.833
REVERSE CRUNCHES.
(gravelly voice) SHRED ME UP.

01:42.833 --> 01:44.475
(gasps) OH.

01:44.475 --> 01:46.237
I'M NOT A PUSHOVER.

01:46.237 --> 01:47.808
SAID THE GIRL
WHO SPENT YESTERDAY

01:47.808 --> 01:50.481
LOOKING AT PAINT SWATCHES
WITH TWO LUNATICS.

01:50.481 --> 01:51.782
SPEAKING OF, THEY DROPPED OFF

01:51.782 --> 01:53.814
A SURE-TO-BE-INSANE
THANK YOU GIFT.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.686
MY MONEY'S ON
TOENAIL CLIPPINGS.

01:55.686 --> 01:57.618
(mouths word)
OH. IT'S A WEDDING INVITATION.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.320
OH, THANK GOODNESS
I ALREADY DECIDED

01:59.320 --> 02:01.622
I'M NEVER ATTENDING
ANOTHER WEDDING.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.294
WHAT IF TRAV AND I
GET MARRIED?

02:03.294 --> 02:04.655
JULES WILL TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT.

02:04.655 --> 02:06.157
WHY DO THEY WANT US
AT THEIR WEDDING ANYWAY?

02:06.157 --> 02:07.558
I MEAN, I'VE ONLY MET 'EM,
LIKE, TWICE,

02:07.558 --> 02:10.601
AND BOTH TIMES, BONNIE TRIED
TO EYE-MOLEST ME.

02:10.601 --> 02:12.463
(laughs)
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

02:12.463 --> 02:15.836
SHE STARED AT MY SNACK PACK
LIKE IT WAS A MAGIC EYE POSTER.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.638
WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD GO.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.870
MNH. SORRY,
BUT THEY'RE GETTING MARRIED

02:19.870 --> 02:22.743
ON THE DAY OF
MY ROLLER HOCKEY FINALS.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.715
I'M NOT GOING.
(Ellie) AH.

02:24.715 --> 02:27.318
THE CLASSIC
HUSBAND AND WIFE STANDOFF.

02:27.318 --> 02:30.321
SHE WANTS ONE THING,
HE WANTS ANOTHER.

02:30.321 --> 02:33.184
WHAT WILL THEY CHOOSE?
HMM?

02:33.184 --> 02:35.426
WELL, HOW DO YOU AND ANDY DECIDE
THINGS LIKE THIS?

02:35.426 --> 02:37.658
HMM. LET ME THINK.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.191
WE COMPROMISE.

02:40.191 --> 02:42.433
(snorts and laughs)

02:42.433 --> 02:46.197
WELL, THIS IS OUR LAST LAP,
SO PLEASE DO YOUR THING,

02:46.197 --> 02:47.798
TRY NOT TO EAT IT.

02:47.798 --> 02:49.840
(whines)
WHAT IS IT, BUD?

02:49.840 --> 02:51.372
(Dog Travis barks)

02:54.805 --> 02:57.548
I'M TELLING YOU, THOSE ARE
DOG TRAVIS' PUPPIES.

02:57.548 --> 02:59.210
DAD, YOU HAD DOG TRAVIS FIXED.

02:59.210 --> 03:01.782
YOU MADE US BURY HIS
LITTLE BUDDIES IN THE BACKYARD.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.554
(chuckles)
I JUST KNOW
THEY'RE UP THERE NOW,

03:03.554 --> 03:05.616
WATCHING OVER ALL OF US.

03:05.616 --> 03:07.558
MUST NOT HAVE TAKEN.

03:07.558 --> 03:10.321
LUCKILY, I GOT SOME PUPPY FUR,
AND I KNOW A GUY WITH DNA KITS.

03:10.321 --> 03:12.793
THE PUP-TERNITY RESULTS ARE IN.

03:12.793 --> 03:15.766
DOG TRAV...

03:15.766 --> 03:17.228
IS THE FATHER!

03:17.228 --> 03:18.499
OHH!
YEE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE!

03:18.499 --> 03:20.731
HA HA!
MAURY POVICH DANCE!

03:20.731 --> 03:22.473
(both) WHOO! WHOO!

03:22.473 --> 03:24.705
(singing indistinctly)
(singsongy) D.T.'s A FATHER!

03:24.705 --> 03:26.577
D.T.'s A FATHER!

03:26.577 --> 03:28.639
YEE-HEE-HEE-HOO!

03:28.639 --> 03:30.210
HEY.
(utensil clatters)

03:30.210 --> 03:31.812
I FOUND A WAY TO GET THROUGH
ALL THOSE COOKIES.

03:31.812 --> 03:36.447
TASTE THE THIN MINT JULEP.

03:36.447 --> 03:39.219
HMM.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.891
WOW! THAT'S TERRIBLE.

03:40.891 --> 03:43.524
I KNOW. I JUST WANTED IT TO WORK
BECAUSE I LOVE THE NAME SO MUCH.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.926
LOOK, YOU HAVE HOCKEY GAMES
ALL THE TIME.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.559
BONNIE AND JERRY ARE ONLY GONNA
GET MARRIED ONCE.

03:48.559 --> 03:50.761
PROBABLY.
WELL, THEN YOU GO TO
THE WEDDING,

03:50.761 --> 03:52.363
AND I'LL GO TO MY GAME.

03:52.363 --> 03:54.305
GO TO A WEDDING BY MYSELF?!

03:54.305 --> 03:55.936
OH, YOU'RE PROBABLY ONE OF THOSE
PEOPLE THAT THOUGHT IT WAS COOL

03:55.936 --> 03:58.339
TO GO STAG TO YOUR PROM.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.611
TRAVIS WENT STAG
TO HIS PROM.

04:00.611 --> 04:01.872
YEAH, UNTIL I SHOWED UP.

04:01.872 --> 04:03.644
AND THEN
WE DANCED THE NIGHT AWAY.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.746
IT WAS A MASQUERADE THEME.
HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ME.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.848
I WONDER WHY HE'S SO WEIRD.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.280
YOU CAN'T SAY NO
TO PEOPLE,

04:09.280 --> 04:10.851
NOT EVEN TO PEOPLE
YOU BARELY KNOW.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.853
I KNOW THEM.
REALLY?

04:12.853 --> 04:14.985
OKAY,
WHAT'S BONNIE'S LAST NAME?

04:14.985 --> 04:17.328
WHAT'S JERRY'S LAST NAME?

04:17.328 --> 04:18.689
UH, WHERE ARE THEY FROM?

04:18.689 --> 04:19.930
WHAT'S THEIR PHONE NUMBER?

04:19.930 --> 04:22.563
5-6-4... 2-1.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.034
LOOK, YOU CAN'T SAY "NO"
TO PEOPLE,

04:24.034 --> 04:26.537
BUT FORTUNATELY...

04:26.537 --> 04:27.768
I CAN.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.900
SEINFELD!
THAT'S HIS LAST NAME!

04:29.900 --> 04:32.272
HIS NAME IS NOT
JERRY SEINFELD.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.774
THEN HOW COME IT SOUNDS
SO FAMILIAR?

04:33.774 --> 04:36.347
(chuckles)
(scoffs)

04:36.347 --> 04:40.511
HEY, TOM? WE RAN OUT OF WINE.
CAN WE BORROW SOME...

04:40.511 --> 04:43.814
HOLY SHI--NIA TWAIN.

04:43.814 --> 04:46.617
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

04:46.617 --> 04:49.320
IT'S MY MINI CUL-DE-SAC.

04:49.320 --> 04:50.921
MODELING'S ALWAYS BEEN
A-A HOBBY.

04:50.921 --> 04:53.564
(laughs)
YEAH, AT FIRST I JUST STARTED
WITH ONE HOUSE,

04:53.564 --> 04:57.828
BUT AS IT GREW, I REALIZED I WAS
IN CONTROL OF THE WHOLE WORLD.

04:57.828 --> 05:00.331
(chuckles)
LIKE A GOD.

05:00.331 --> 05:02.903
UH, PRETTY COOL, HUH?

05:02.903 --> 05:05.906
IT'S ALL EXACTLY TO SCALE.

05:05.906 --> 05:09.079
WHAT'S GRAYSON'S DOING
LAYING FACEDOWN IN THE BATHTUB?

05:09.079 --> 05:10.541
OH, NO. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

05:10.541 --> 05:11.882
IT'S ME!

05:11.882 --> 05:13.344
YOU GAVE ME TRICEPS.
(chuckles)

05:13.344 --> 05:14.585
I NOTICED
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING.

05:14.585 --> 05:16.517
(doll clatters)
YEAH. (gasps)

05:16.517 --> 05:19.750
OH. MOM WILL LIKE THE SIZE
OF HER BOOBS.
YEAH.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.622
AND HER HAIR COLOR
IS PERFECT.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.754
I USED PRINTER INK.

05:23.754 --> 05:26.357
MRS. TORRES!
OKAY, THIS IS WEIRD.

05:26.357 --> 05:28.999
THIS DOLL IS PHYSICALLY COLDER
THAN THE OTHERS.
(whispers) UH, YEAH.

05:28.999 --> 05:32.933
WHOA. HOLD UP.
TOM, IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE ME?

05:32.933 --> 05:36.607
I DON'T WEAR THIS MUCH MAKEUP.
THIS DOLL LOOKS INSANE.

05:36.607 --> 05:37.968
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

05:37.968 --> 05:40.541
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU.
IT'S IDENTICAL.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.443
SERIOUSLY?!

05:42.443 --> 05:44.875
UH-OH.

05:44.875 --> 05:46.647
HEY, TOM, I CAN'T HELP
BUT NOTICE THAT, UH,

05:46.647 --> 05:48.719
GRAYSON IS VERY TINY,

05:48.719 --> 05:51.652
AND YOU ARE
EXTREMELY JACKED.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.925
THAT'S, UH, FORCED PERSPECTIVE.
YOU--YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

05:54.925 --> 05:56.457
LET'S SEE WHAT BOBBY AND ANDY
ARE UP TO.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.429
(Bobby) I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET
MY GRANDPUPPIES.

05:58.429 --> 05:59.830
WELCOME TO THE FAMILY,
BIG GUY.

05:59.830 --> 06:01.832
I'M YOUR IN-LAW BOBBY COBB.

06:01.832 --> 06:03.093
EXCUSE ME?

06:03.093 --> 06:05.796
THE PUPS.
MY DOG IS THEIR POP.

06:05.796 --> 06:07.137
HOW'S THIS WORK? I NAME HALF,
AND YOU NAME HALF?

06:07.137 --> 06:08.999
'CAUSE I WANNA CALL HIM GIZMO.

06:08.999 --> 06:10.801
(giggles) THAT TICKLES.
(laughs)

06:10.801 --> 06:12.543
HEY, IS IT TOO EARLY
TO TALK HOLIDAYS?

06:12.543 --> 06:14.875
'CAUSE YOU CAN HAVE THANKSGIVING
BUT I NEED CHRISTMAS,

06:14.875 --> 06:16.847
'CAUSE I WANNA PUT 'EM ALL
IN LITTLE TINY SANTA HATS.

06:16.847 --> 06:18.148
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHO THE HELL
YOU GUYS ARE,

06:18.148 --> 06:19.980
BUT STAY AWAY FROM MY DOGS!

06:19.980 --> 06:23.153
(dog barking)

06:23.153 --> 06:25.155
(puppies whine)

06:25.155 --> 06:26.957
(man) STAY AWAY!

06:26.957 --> 06:30.621
HI. WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUY
SOME COOKIES?

06:30.621 --> 06:33.023
FINE. I'LL BUY THE WHOLE BAG.
(chuckles)

06:33.023 --> 06:34.725
HERE YOU GO.
(Ellie) JELLYBEAN WAS RIGHT.

06:34.725 --> 06:36.066
THE WORD IS SPREADING.

06:36.066 --> 06:37.728
OH, CRAP--BONNIE AND JERRY.

06:37.728 --> 06:40.000
ACT LIKE YOU'RE SAD WE CAN'T
MAKE IT TO THE WEDDING.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.472
HEY, GUYS!

06:41.472 --> 06:42.703
HI! OH!
(chuckles)

06:42.703 --> 06:44.475
COME HERE! MMM!

06:44.475 --> 06:46.637
OH!
NOPE.

06:46.637 --> 06:48.408
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE HAVING LUNCH.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.840
(Jules) ACTUALLY,
WE WERE JUST LEAVING.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.182
GOTTA GO. SEE YA.
I'M SORRY. BYE, GUYS.

06:52.182 --> 06:54.144
(exhales deeply)

06:55.586 --> 06:57.688
OH! WE GOT YOUR R.S.V.P.

06:57.688 --> 07:00.991
WE ARE SO HAPPY YOU'RE COMING
TO THE WEDDING.

07:00.991 --> 07:02.623
GREAT.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.455
(high-pitched whine)

07:04.455 --> 07:06.597
WE'RE REGISTERED
AT RADIO SHACK.

07:06.597 --> 07:08.098
(chuckles)
THAT'S FUNNY.

07:08.098 --> 07:09.530
I'M PRETTY SURE I MARKED "NO,"
SEALED THE ENVELOPE,

07:09.530 --> 07:10.931
AND PUT INTO THE MAILBOX.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.202
SO UNLESS SOMEBODY GOT IT
OUT OF THE MAILBOX

07:12.202 --> 07:14.434
AND CHANGED OUR REPLY...

07:14.434 --> 07:16.937
OH, MY GOD.
YOUR ABS ARE TIGHTER TODAY.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.509
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

07:18.509 --> 07:20.010
(chuckles) I ADDED PILATES
TO MY WORKOUT.

07:20.010 --> 07:21.972
OH, SO SMART.

07:24.044 --> 07:27.217
TRAVIS IS RIGHT. THIS IS INSANE.

07:27.217 --> 07:28.679
THAT'S FUNNY.

07:28.679 --> 07:29.980
MY DOLL'S SHIRT
IS THE SAME MATERIAL

07:29.980 --> 07:31.482
AS MY FAVORITE DRESS
THAT I CAN'T FIND.

07:31.482 --> 07:33.223
(laughs nervously)

07:33.223 --> 07:34.825
THAT IS FUNNY.

07:34.825 --> 07:37.828
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
MAKING ME MISS MY HOCKEY GAME.

07:37.828 --> 07:39.960
OH, WAIT.
I JUST HAD A BRAIN-FLOOD.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.092
(chuckles) IF YOU MEAN
"A REALLY GOOD IDEA,"

07:42.092 --> 07:43.664
IT'S A BRAINSTORM.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.536
WHY? STORMS ARE DARK
AND CONFUSING.

07:45.536 --> 07:47.467
A FLOOD IS A HUGE RUSH.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.699
ELLIE?

07:48.699 --> 07:50.000
(Tom, deep voice)
CHANGE APPROVED!

07:50.000 --> 07:51.572
(Tom laughs)

07:51.572 --> 07:53.243
MM. WHY DON'T WE GO TO BOTH?

07:53.243 --> 07:55.676
THE WEDDING'S AT 3:00.
THE GAME'S AT 4:00.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.108
WE HIT THE WEDDING,
WE SHOW OUR FACES,

07:58.108 --> 07:59.650
AND THEN WE GO TO THE GAME.

07:59.650 --> 08:01.051
I PROMISE YOU THIS WILL WORK.

08:01.051 --> 08:03.554
HEY, TOM,
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT

08:03.554 --> 08:06.116
ONE OF MY BOOBS IS
SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN THE OTHER?

08:06.116 --> 08:09.990
THAT'S IT. I'M GOING TO
CHECK OUR ROOM FOR CAMERAS.

08:12.122 --> 08:15.526
(singsongy)
HE WON'T FIND THEM.

08:15.526 --> 08:18.268
WHAT KIND OF MAN WANTS TO KEEP
A BUNCH OF ADORABLE DOG PUPS

08:18.268 --> 08:21.131
AWAY FROM THEIR LOVING
HUMAN GRANDPAPPY?

08:21.131 --> 08:22.533
I'D SAY A NORMAL ONE.

08:22.533 --> 08:23.834
BABE, BACK ME UP HERE.

08:23.834 --> 08:25.135
NO, I'M SORRY. WHAT?

08:25.135 --> 08:26.977
IT'S JUST, I CAN'T HEAR YOU

08:26.977 --> 08:29.810
THROUGH ALL THE LAYERS OF
CLOWN MAKEUP THAT I'M WEARING.

08:29.810 --> 08:33.884
AND IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M DUE BACK AT THE CIRCUS.

08:33.884 --> 08:37.117
YOU KNOW,
WHERE CLOWNS WORK.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.620
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?
HUH?

08:39.620 --> 08:41.992
I ACCIDENTALLY SAID SOMETHING
THAT HURT HER FEELINGS.

08:41.992 --> 08:43.223
TRAVIS, YOU SHOULD NEVER

08:43.223 --> 08:45.125
ACCIDENTALLY HURT
SOMEONE'S FEELINGS.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.528
IT SHOULD BE DONE WITH INTENT
AND PURPOSE.

08:48.528 --> 08:52.002
THOSE SHORTS ACCENTUATE
YOUR BALDNESS.

08:52.002 --> 08:53.734
(Travis laughs) GOOD ONE.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.235
I SHOULD REALLY GO AFTER HER.

08:55.235 --> 08:58.839
HONEY, YOUR NASTINESS
JUST GAVE ME A GREAT IDEA.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.210
DID YOU HAVE A BRAIN-FLOOD?

09:00.210 --> 09:01.742
WHAT? WHERE'D THAT COME FROM?

09:01.742 --> 09:04.144
I HAVE NO IDEA.
BUT I APPROVE.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.216
ALL RIGHT.
YOU CAN HELP BOBBY.

09:06.216 --> 09:07.678
I'M OUT.

09:07.678 --> 09:09.620
COME ON! HE NEEDS A LAWYER.

09:09.620 --> 09:12.552
YOU'RE THE MOST SAVAGE, RUTHLESS
BALLBUSTER I'VE EVER MET.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.224
GO ON.

09:14.224 --> 09:16.226
YOU LOOK SMOKING HOT WHEN YOU
WEAR YOUR ASS-KICKING HEELS...

09:16.226 --> 09:17.988
MM-HMM.
AND YOU'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
GOING BACK TO WORK.

09:17.988 --> 09:19.760
THIS JACKASS WON'T EVEN
LET ME VISIT

09:19.760 --> 09:21.962
DOG TRAVIS' BASTARD PUPPIES.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.995
I DO LOVE DESTROYING
JACKASSES.

09:24.995 --> 09:26.837
HOW BIG A JACKASS IS HE?

09:26.837 --> 09:28.198
HE WEARS
A PUKA SHELL NECKLACE.

09:28.198 --> 09:30.000
WHEN DO WE START?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.603
THEY'RE HAVING THEIR WEDDING
IN BOBBY'S BOAT YARD?

09:32.603 --> 09:35.976
WELL, BOBBY OWED JERRY 6 BUCKS,
AND THIS IS HOW THEY SQUARED UP.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.608
I LOVE IT!

09:37.608 --> 09:39.009
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE THEME IS?

09:39.009 --> 09:41.782
MM, AN A.A. MEETING?
craigslist?

09:41.782 --> 09:43.183
S.T.D. CLINIC.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.655
I WAS THINKING MORE LIKE

09:44.655 --> 09:46.657
AN AFTERNOON
IN A BEACHSIDE PARADISE.

09:46.657 --> 09:48.258
AND THEN THERE'S THAT GUY.

09:48.258 --> 09:51.191
I'M WATCHING THE CLOCK, OKAY?
I GOTTA MAKE MY GAME.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.593
I THOUGHT THIS THROUGH.
YOU HAVE YOUR JACKET?

09:53.593 --> 09:55.165
CHECK.
GOOD.

09:55.165 --> 09:57.027
YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE IT ON
THE BACK OF YOUR DINNER CHAIR.

09:57.027 --> 09:59.770
AND THAT WAY, PEOPLE WILL THINK
WE'RE UP MINGLING ALL NIGHT.

09:59.770 --> 10:02.673
MNH. MY DAD LEFT THIS JACKET
TO ME WHEN HE DIED.

10:02.673 --> 10:04.174
DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE GAME OR NOT?

10:04.174 --> 10:05.936
GREAT.

10:05.936 --> 10:07.607
(bird squawks)
LET'S GO PHOTO BOMB
SOME PICTURES.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.239
THAT GUY'S GOT A BIRD
ON HIS HEAD.

10:09.239 --> 10:11.311
(chuckles)

10:11.311 --> 10:13.844
(high-pitched voice)
TRAV, WHAT HAPPENED?

10:13.844 --> 10:15.946
(normal voice) WELL,
AFTER THE METEOR HIT,

10:15.946 --> 10:18.789
I WOKE TO FIND
I HAVE A NEW POWER--

10:18.789 --> 10:21.321
HUMAN FLIGHT!

10:21.321 --> 10:23.093
HEY! WHOA! HI.

10:23.093 --> 10:24.624
I WAS JUST--JUST, UH...
SHH, SHH, SHH.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.857
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S A SAFE PLACE.

10:26.857 --> 10:29.029
JUST LET YOUR IMAGINATION
RUN FREE.

10:29.029 --> 10:32.332
I DO. (inhales deeply)
BELIEVE ME.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.805
(muffled voice) HEY, GUYS.

10:34.805 --> 10:36.036
WOW. (chuckles)

10:36.036 --> 10:37.708
I WOULD SAY THAT WAS INSANE

10:37.708 --> 10:39.870
IF I WASN'T HOLDING
A DOLL VERSION OF MY OWN MOTHER.

10:39.870 --> 10:41.211
(visor clacks)
WELL...

10:41.211 --> 10:43.073
SINCE YOU OBVIOUSLY THINK

10:43.073 --> 10:45.816
THAT I HAVE
A RIDICULOUS CLOWN FACE,

10:45.816 --> 10:47.678
I'VE DECIDED TO HIDE IT
FROM YOU.

10:47.678 --> 10:49.049
SO YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.380
WELL, NOW I NEED TO MAKE
A TINY LITTLE HELMET.

10:50.380 --> 10:51.782
(visor clacks)

10:51.782 --> 10:53.954
LAURIE, I'M SORRY.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.957
(visor clacks)
THIS IS THE NEW ME, TRAVIS.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.388
YOU SHOULD JUST
GET USED TO IT.

10:58.388 --> 11:00.130
(visor clacks)

11:00.130 --> 11:01.792
LAURIE!
(door opens)

11:01.792 --> 11:03.193
99 PROBLEMS.

11:03.193 --> 11:04.995
LET'S SEE WHAT BOBBY AND ELLIE
ARE UP TO.

11:04.995 --> 11:07.097
(Ellie)
YOU ARE IN GOOD HANDS.

11:07.097 --> 11:08.668
I HAVE NEVER LOST
IN THIS SUIT.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.141
I CALL IT "THE WIDOW-MAKER."

11:11.141 --> 11:13.774
GAME TIME.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.776
HEELS.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.248
DAMN!
YOU BROUGHT THE HEAT, GIRL.

11:18.248 --> 11:20.450
LET'S GO KICK
THIS GUY'S ASS.

11:20.450 --> 11:21.882
(babbles)

11:21.882 --> 11:23.253
EXCUSE ME?

11:23.253 --> 11:24.885
IF YOUR POOP SCOOPING SCHEDULE
WILL ALLOW,

11:24.885 --> 11:27.818
I'D LIKE TO HAVE A WORD
ABOUT THOSE POOCHES.

11:27.818 --> 11:30.320
ME?
NO, THE OTHER GUY WITH
THE WAGON FULL OF PUPPIES.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.962
ARE YOU AWARE

11:31.962 --> 11:35.966
THAT CHAPTER 61 OF
FLORIDA FAMILY LAW STATUTES

11:35.966 --> 11:41.001
STATE THAT YOU MUST COMPLY
WITH ALL PARENTING SCHEDULES?

11:41.001 --> 11:42.432
THREE DAYS A WEEK
AND ALTERNATING HOLIDAYS

11:42.432 --> 11:44.074
WILL BE FINE.
MM-HMM.

11:44.074 --> 11:47.137
I'M ALSO AWARE THAT
FLORIDA FAMILY LAW

11:47.137 --> 11:49.840
ONLY APPLIES TO HUMANS.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.083
HONEY, YOU'RE NOT AS SCARY
AS YOU THINK.

11:53.083 --> 11:55.045
BUH-BYE NOW.

11:57.247 --> 11:58.789
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

11:58.789 --> 12:00.751
DID WE LOSE?

12:00.751 --> 12:03.153
OH, WOULD YOU STOP LOOKING
AT YOUR WATCH?

12:03.153 --> 12:05.996
JUST RELAX AND ENJOY
THE INSANE ASSORTMENT OF PEOPLE.

12:05.996 --> 12:08.759
OKAY, FINE. HEY, LOOK--
SCOTT BAIO. (laughs)

12:08.759 --> 12:10.260
(laughs)
HEY, LOOK OVER THERE.

12:10.260 --> 12:12.863
THERE'S THE BAD GUY FROM
EVERY BLACK-AND-WHITE MOVIE.

12:12.863 --> 12:15.235
(laughs evilly)
(laughs evilly)

12:15.235 --> 12:17.137
OH, YOU THINK THAT'S BAD?

12:17.137 --> 12:19.069
CHECK OUT "HOW MANY MEATBALLS
CAN I FIT INTO MY MOUTH?" GUY.

12:19.069 --> 12:20.871
OH, NO. A-A DIFFERENT GUY.

12:20.871 --> 12:22.342
OH!
(man, amplified voice)
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

12:22.342 --> 12:23.874
PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEATS.
WE'RE ABOUT TO START.

12:23.874 --> 12:25.976
WOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE STARTING ON TIME.

12:25.976 --> 12:28.879
THIS ACTUALLY MIGHT WORK.
I TOLD YOU I KNEW
WHAT I WAS DOING.

12:28.879 --> 12:30.120
NOW THE SECOND THEY WALK
DOWN THE AISLE,

12:30.120 --> 12:31.321
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!

12:31.321 --> 12:33.023
MMM!
MMM!

12:33.023 --> 12:36.927
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING
IN THE CHEAP SEATS?

12:36.927 --> 12:39.960
MAID OF HONOR AND BEST MAN
NEED TO BE UP FRONT.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.932
I'M SORRY.
M-MAID OF WHAT NOW?

12:41.932 --> 12:44.965
HURRY UP! WE'RE STARTING!
GOT THE RINGS?

12:44.965 --> 12:46.937
WHAT?

12:46.937 --> 12:49.339
I'M KIDDING! (laughs)
I'VE GOT THE RINGS. COME ON!

12:51.171 --> 12:54.875
WELL, THAT'S A SMALL
LITTLE WRINKLE IN THE PLAN.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.150
I THOUGHT THAT "FIRST MATE" WAS
JUST A CUTESY NAME FOR "GUEST."

13:00.150 --> 13:02.282
WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST SAY "NO"
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

13:02.282 --> 13:05.215
SO I'M MAKING A VIRAL VIDEO
OUT OF THIS.

13:05.215 --> 13:08.118
ACT SURPRISED WHEN MY FRIEND
FAT DAVE STREAKS THE CEREMONY.

13:08.118 --> 13:10.490
MM, OKAY.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.062
(exhales deeply)
(organ playing "Bridal Chorus"
from Wagner's "Lohengrin")

13:12.062 --> 13:14.264
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD.
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER.

13:14.264 --> 13:16.096
в™Єв™Єв™Є

13:16.096 --> 13:18.398
SERIOUSLY? RIGHT NOW?

13:18.398 --> 13:20.971
ALL RIGHT, UM,
I'LL TAKE ONE BOX.

13:20.971 --> 13:23.133
(whispers) PEANUT BUTTER.
PAY YOU LATER.

13:26.877 --> 13:30.440
IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW MUCH
THIS DOLL LOOK LIKES ME.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.512
I'D SUE YOU FOR USING
MY LIKENESS,

13:32.512 --> 13:34.885
BUT I'D PROBABLY LOSE.

13:34.885 --> 13:38.118
YEAH, WELL, THIS BOBBY DOESN'T
HAVE ANY PUPPIES EITHER.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.350
THAT GUY WASN'T AFRAID AT ALL.

13:40.350 --> 13:42.422
I'VE LOST MY EDGE.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.495
NO. YOU'RE STILL AS TERRIFYING
AND VICIOUS AS EVER.

13:45.495 --> 13:49.399
TOM, SHOW HER YOUR ELLIE DOLL.

13:49.399 --> 13:51.831
NO, NO. THE OTHER ONE.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.133
ANGRY ELLIE.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.265
NO, THANK YOU.
I DON'T WANT TO.

13:55.265 --> 13:57.267
TOM, DO IT.

13:57.267 --> 13:58.568
SEE, ELLIE?

13:58.568 --> 14:01.611
THIS IS HOW TOM ENVISIONS YOU
IN HIS HEAD--

14:01.611 --> 14:03.573
AS A GIANT, HORRIBLE DRAGON.

14:03.573 --> 14:06.076
YOU DO?

14:06.076 --> 14:07.577
(whispers) OH, TOM...

14:07.577 --> 14:09.119
(stifles sob)

14:09.119 --> 14:12.222
NOW GO FIND
THAT PUPPY-HOARDING JACKASS

14:12.222 --> 14:15.155
AND LET HIM TASTE THE WRATH
OF THE DRAGON LADY.

14:15.155 --> 14:18.228
PUKA SHELL IS GOIN' DOWN.

14:18.228 --> 14:19.960
YEAH!

14:24.194 --> 14:26.466
KNOCK-KNOCK. (chuckles)

14:26.466 --> 14:29.469
OKAY, CAN YOU JUST TAKE
THAT THING OFF SO WE CAN TALK?

14:29.469 --> 14:34.004
LOOK, I'M SORRY THAT
I HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

14:34.004 --> 14:35.205
I LIKE THAT YOU WEAR
A LOT OF MAKEUP.

14:35.205 --> 14:36.947
I MEAN...

14:36.947 --> 14:39.379
UH, YOU'RE LIKE A...
LIKE A BEAUTY PAGEANT QUEEN.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.282
NOT ONE OF THOSE SLUTTED OUT
"TODDLERS & TIARA" FREAKS.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.614
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:44.614 --> 14:46.586
AAH!
WHY CAN'T I JUST SAY THIS?

14:46.586 --> 14:48.258
YOU KNOW, WE NEVER FOUGHT
ABOUT ANYTHING

14:48.258 --> 14:51.461
BEFORE THOSE STUPID
YET SKILLFULLY CRAFTED DOLLS.

14:51.461 --> 14:53.163
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:53.163 --> 14:56.226
THIS IS ALL BECAUSE OF TOM
AND HIS FREAKY DOLLS.

14:56.226 --> 15:00.430
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA PUT
AN END TO THIS RIGHT NOW.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.203
WAIT UP!

15:05.505 --> 15:07.207
GUESS I WON'T BE NEEDING THAT.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.079
YOU WERE WEARING A GROIN CUP?

15:09.079 --> 15:11.681
YEAH, BECAUSE I WAS GONNA TRY
AND SKATE RIGHT INTO THE GAME.

15:11.681 --> 15:15.986
ALSO 'CAUSE BONNIE TRIED TO GRAB
ME THERE TWICE ALREADY TODAY.

15:15.986 --> 15:17.547
BUT WHO CARES NOW ANYWAY?

15:17.547 --> 15:19.919
BECAUSE WE'RE STUCK AT THIS
STUPID CRAPFEST OF A WEDDING.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.251
(feedback whines)
(amplified voice) ALL RIGHT,

15:21.251 --> 15:24.654
SO NOW IT IS TIME
FOR THE TOASTS, EVERYBODY.

15:24.654 --> 15:26.326
(cheers and applause)

15:26.326 --> 15:27.597
WHAT?

15:27.597 --> 15:29.459
OH.
(sighs)

15:29.459 --> 15:32.062
(amplified voice) HI.

15:32.062 --> 15:35.165
MARRIAGE IS SUPPOSED TO BE
ABOUT COMPROMISE.

15:35.165 --> 15:38.068
BUT THEN YOU GET STEAMROLLED
BY YOUR PEOPLE-PLEASING WIFE

15:38.068 --> 15:39.569
AND YOU MISS
YOUR STREET HOCKEY PLAYOFF GAME,

15:39.569 --> 15:42.973
ALL TO HANG OUT WITH
A BUNCH OF JACKASSES. CHEERS.

15:42.973 --> 15:45.015
(thud)

15:45.015 --> 15:46.446
HOW GREAT IS THIS GUY?

15:46.446 --> 15:49.679
(amplified voice) JULES' TURN!
JULES' TURN! OW!

15:49.679 --> 15:51.121
(feedback whines)
(chuckles)

15:51.121 --> 15:52.522
(amplified voice)
OKAY, UM...

15:52.522 --> 15:54.454
FIRST OFF, CONGRATULATIONS
TO YOU, BONNIE.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.156
I SAW THAT BABY BUMP.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.358
(lowered voice)
WHAT'S SHE TALKING ABOUT?

15:58.358 --> 15:59.589
OH.

15:59.589 --> 16:03.033
OH. A-ANYWAY, UM...

16:03.033 --> 16:04.634
WELL, MY WEDDING DAY--

16:04.634 --> 16:06.196
WELL,
MY SECOND WEDDING DAY---

16:06.196 --> 16:08.598
WAS THE HAPPIEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

16:08.598 --> 16:11.141
AND I HOPE THE SAME FOR YOU,
BONNIE AND JERRY.

16:11.141 --> 16:14.504
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU TRY
SO HARD TO...

16:14.504 --> 16:16.446
MAKE EVERYONE ELSE
AROUND YOU HAPPY

16:16.446 --> 16:18.178
THAT YOU OVERLOOK

16:18.178 --> 16:22.252
THE HAPPINESS OF THE PERSON
THAT YOU LOVE MOST.

16:22.252 --> 16:24.514
AND THAT'S NOT OKAY.

16:24.514 --> 16:26.416
SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY,
BON AND JER,

16:26.416 --> 16:30.620
IS JUST ALWAYS PUT
THE OTHER PERSON FIRST.

16:32.062 --> 16:34.494
ALL RIGHT. NOW IT'S TIME TO
TOSS THE GARTER! LINE UP, BOYS!

16:34.494 --> 16:38.068
HOLD ON.
I GOT SOMETHING TO ADD.

16:38.068 --> 16:40.370
(sighs deeply)
I JUST WANNA ADD THAT,

16:40.370 --> 16:43.273
IF YOU'RE THE WOMAN
THAT GOES OUT OF THEIR WAY

16:43.273 --> 16:44.704
TO MAKE EVERYONE ELSE HAPPY--

16:44.704 --> 16:46.206
AND I'M OBVIOUSLY TALKING
ABOUT YOU HERE, BONNIE.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.607
YEAH.
YOU DO SO BECAUSE

16:47.607 --> 16:50.540
YOU'VE GOT THE BIGGEST HEART
OF ANYONE I KNOW.

16:50.540 --> 16:54.684
AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES YOU
IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTIVE TO ME.

16:54.684 --> 16:56.416
OH. (chuckles)

16:56.416 --> 16:57.747
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

16:57.747 --> 16:59.689
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

16:59.689 --> 17:01.451
(mouths word)

17:01.451 --> 17:05.195
OH. (chuckles)

17:05.195 --> 17:06.426
(clears throat)

17:06.426 --> 17:08.128
(voice breaks)
AND I LOVE YOU...

17:08.128 --> 17:10.530
BON AND JER.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.062
YOU'VE NEVER LOOKED
MORE BEAUTIFUL

17:12.062 --> 17:13.503
THAN YOU LOOK RIGHT NOW.

17:13.503 --> 17:15.565
(applause)

17:15.565 --> 17:17.467
(mics thud)

17:17.467 --> 17:21.171
(woman chuckles) OOH!

17:21.171 --> 17:22.512
(chuckles)

17:22.512 --> 17:24.174
OOH. DESSERT CAME EARLY.

17:24.174 --> 17:26.416
(chuckles)

17:26.416 --> 17:29.249
HEY, PUKA-FACE.

17:29.249 --> 17:32.452
(flatly) OH, YAY.

17:32.452 --> 17:35.725
I'LL ADMIT, LAST TIME I BROUGHT
THE WEAK SAUCE.

17:35.725 --> 17:37.287
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED

17:37.287 --> 17:39.489
WHY I BECAME A LAWYER
IN THE FIRST PLACE--

17:39.489 --> 17:41.561
TO SEE THE LOOK IN THE EYE

17:41.561 --> 17:45.095
OF SOME COCKY, D-BAG JACKASS

17:45.095 --> 17:47.737
THE MOMENT HE REALIZES
THAT HIS TESTICLES

17:47.737 --> 17:50.200
ARE GONNA BE LEGALLY RIPPED

17:50.200 --> 17:54.674
FROM HIS BODY AND SHOVED UP
HIS POMPOUS ASS.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.706
YOU MEAN...

17:58.848 --> 18:02.212
HERE IS YOUR HALF
OF THE LITTER.

18:02.212 --> 18:03.453
WAIT. WHAT?

18:03.453 --> 18:05.155
I OWN 'EM?

18:05.155 --> 18:06.686
NO, I JUST WANTED TO BE ABLE
TO PLAY WITH 'EM.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.718
I DIDN'T WANT TO OWN 'EM.

18:08.718 --> 18:10.190
BABE, YOU DID IT.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.721
I KNEW YOU STILL HAD IT.

18:11.721 --> 18:13.563
THANK YOU
FOR ALWAYS REMINDING ME

18:13.563 --> 18:16.566
WHAT A BALLBUSTER I AM,
BOO.

18:16.566 --> 18:18.097
A QUICK?
YEAH.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.569
(both speak indistinctly)

18:19.569 --> 18:21.171
HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! HEY!

18:21.171 --> 18:24.304
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH ALL THESE PUPPIES?

18:24.304 --> 18:25.575
(puppies whine)

18:25.575 --> 18:28.278
HEY. HEY! STOP HUMPING!
THAT'S YOUR KIN!

18:28.278 --> 18:30.240
OH, HEY!

18:30.240 --> 18:31.481

18:31.481 --> 18:33.143
NO, NO, NO, NO! NO TINKLIN'!

18:33.143 --> 18:35.285
OH, YOU!

18:35.285 --> 18:37.687
(clicks lighter)
I'M GONNA GO LEFT EYE
ON THIS DOLLHOUSES.

18:37.687 --> 18:39.219
(Tom, as Laurie) OH, TRAV,

18:39.219 --> 18:40.890
Y-YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR ME.

18:40.890 --> 18:43.593
I GREW UP IN
A DOZEN FOSTER HOMES,

18:43.593 --> 18:46.296
JUST ANOTHER KID HAULING
FERTILIZER AND GASOLINE

18:46.296 --> 18:48.598
ACROSS STATE LINES.

18:48.598 --> 18:51.901
I WANTED A WAY TO STAND OUT
AND KEEP MY IDENTITY.

18:51.901 --> 18:53.733
DOING MY MAKEUP DIFFERENT
THAN EVERYBODY ELSE

18:53.733 --> 18:55.635
IS HOW I GOT THAT.

18:55.635 --> 18:59.138
SO IT KINDA FELT LIKE YOU WERE
MAKING FUN OF WHO I AM.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.312
(as Travis) AW, I-I THINK
YOU'RE ALWAYS GORGEOUS.

19:02.312 --> 19:05.915
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, I WANNA
SEE THE PLAIN AND NATURAL YOU.

19:05.915 --> 19:08.248
(as Laurie)
AW, YOU REALLY MEAN THAT?

19:08.248 --> 19:09.749
WHAT, WHAT?!

19:09.749 --> 19:11.581
(as Travis) YEAH. COME HERE.

19:11.581 --> 19:13.523
(acoustic version of Nonono's
"Pumpin Blood" playing)

19:13.523 --> 19:15.585
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT TO SAY.

19:17.327 --> 19:20.260
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.293
I GUESS MAYBE I CAN MIX IT UP
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

19:23.293 --> 19:25.665
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
(laughs)

19:25.665 --> 19:28.768
в™Є AND IF YOUR HEART IS ALIVE в™Є

19:28.768 --> 19:31.201
(as Laurie) YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL?

19:31.201 --> 19:32.742
HERE, LET ME GET THIS TOP OFF.

19:32.742 --> 19:34.374
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.645
в™Є IS WHISTLING в™Є

19:35.645 --> 19:40.910
(whistling melody)

19:40.910 --> 19:43.513
I'M NOT SURE THAT MOVE IS SAFE
FOR A PREGNANT WOMAN.

19:43.513 --> 19:45.255
MNH.

19:45.255 --> 19:48.488
YOU KNOW, OUR WEDDING WAS
THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE, TOO.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.759
EVEN HAPPIER THAN WHEN
SOMEONE THOUGHT YOU WERE GAY

19:49.759 --> 19:51.221
BECAUSE YOU WERE IN
SUCH GOOD SHAPE?

19:51.221 --> 19:52.892
(chuckles)
THAT WAS A GOOD DAY.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.525
STILL, I'D RATHER BE HERE
WITH YOU AT THIS CRAPPY WEDDING

19:55.525 --> 19:58.898
THAN AT MY STUPID HOCKEY GAME
ANYWAY.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.670
OOH! YOU'RE SO SWEET. MMM.

20:00.670 --> 20:01.901
YOU'RE SUCH A LIAR.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.473
NO, I'M NOT.

20:03.473 --> 20:05.775
REALLY? THEN WHY ARE YOU
WEARING YOUR SKATES?

20:05.775 --> 20:08.308
(grunts)

20:08.308 --> 20:10.410

20:10.410 --> 20:11.711

20:11.711 --> 20:13.913
I'M GONNA KICK SOME ASS!

(laughs)

20:13.913 --> 20:15.745
в™Єв™Єв™Є

20:15.745 --> 20:17.517
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

20:17.517 --> 20:20.520
в™Є 'CAUSE IT'S YOUR HEART,
IT'S ALIVE в™Є

20:23.353 --> 20:24.924
(as Jules) OH, TOM,
THANKS FOR COMING BY.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.556
(as himself) OH, SURPRISE,
NO PROBLEM. WHERE'S GRAYSON?

20:26.556 --> 20:27.997
(as Grayson) HEY,
HAS ANYBODY MENTIONED MY NAME?

20:27.997 --> 20:29.759
I GOT STUNG IN THE FACE
BY A BUNCH OF HORNETS.

20:29.759 --> 20:31.501
IT'S ALL PUFFY.

20:31.501 --> 20:33.503
I CAN'T REALLY HEAR ANYTHING
AND I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

20:33.503 --> 20:34.834
OH! I JUST TRIPPED.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.606
(as Jules) I HAVE TO DEAL
WITH HIM NOW.

20:36.606 --> 20:38.808
YOU KNOW, I FEEL SUCH
A CONNECTION TO YOU SOMETIMES.

20:38.808 --> 20:40.540
(as himself) HA. YEAH, ME, TOO.

20:40.540 --> 20:41.811
(as Jules) NO, I MEAN IT.
LIKE A REAL CONNECTION.

20:41.811 --> 20:43.012
(as himself) WHAT?

20:43.012 --> 20:44.874
(as Jules) SHH. DON'T TALK.

20:44.874 --> 20:47.417
(as himself) WHAT IS THAT? IT
LOOKS LIKE A GIANT MUTANT PUPPY.

20:47.417 --> 20:49.719
(as Jules) TOM! TOM! SAVE ME!

20:49.719 --> 20:50.980
(as himself) OH, NO!

20:50.980 --> 20:54.524
AND HIS FRIEND DESTRUCTO

20:54.524 --> 20:57.357
IT'S GOT GRAYSON!
