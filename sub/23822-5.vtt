00:02.770 --> 00:05.106

00:05.139 --> 00:07.707

and the Infinity Guard</i>

00:07.741 --> 00:09.410

00:11.911 --> 00:14.414
<i>Oh, no!...

00:14.447 --> 00:16.282
<i>a huge mystery threatening Earth.</i>

00:16.315 --> 00:17.884
<i>Oh, double no.</i>

00:17.917 --> 00:20.454
<i>My slacks are tightening
just thinking about this.</i>

00:20.486 --> 00:23.456
<i>Oh, triple no.</i>

00:25.058 --> 00:28.596
<i>Gary, you have 5 minutes
of oxygen left.</i>

00:28.628 --> 00:29.963
I lived a good life.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.700
Medium to good/ borderline crappy.

00:32.732 --> 00:35.903
Saw some side boob once.
That was cool.

00:35.935 --> 00:38.304
H.U.E., have you
ever seen side boob?

00:38.337 --> 00:40.240
<i>Side boob?
No, Gary.</i>

00:40.273 --> 00:42.642
<i>The more you talk,
the more oxygen you...</i>

00:42.675 --> 00:46.045
You're missing out.
I guess it wasn't all that bad.

00:46.078 --> 00:49.649
In fact, I take it back.
I lived a good one.

00:52.019 --> 00:53.754
Of course! This is...

00:53.787 --> 00:56.791
Thank you!
My life sucks!

01:25.785 --> 01:27.754
This is where Captain Gary wields

01:27.787 --> 01:30.990
the great giant scepter of power.

01:31.023 --> 01:33.960
You're not a Captain.
Communication output requested.

01:33.993 --> 01:36.462
Requesting a communications
output, are we?

01:36.496 --> 01:39.166
You really know how to press my buttons.

01:39.198 --> 01:42.386
- Press!
- Ugh. Let me unpress your button

01:42.387 --> 01:44.038
painfully short and clear.

01:44.070 --> 01:48.108
It is never going to
happen between us. Ever.

01:49.209 --> 01:51.678
That was painfully short...
and clear!

01:51.712 --> 01:53.680
Come on, Quinn.
Why won't you give me a chance?

01:53.713 --> 01:56.016
You impersonated a member
of the Infinity Guard

01:56.049 --> 01:58.519
and blew up 92 Imperium Cruisers.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.553
That doesn't inspire a lot of trust.

02:00.587 --> 02:02.489
Then I guess this precious
thing we have between us

02:02.522 --> 02:04.859
is not gonna work out.
I'm sorry.

02:04.891 --> 02:08.027
- Did you just break up with me?
- Quinn, it's over.

02:08.060 --> 02:10.363
I pulled the Cupid's arrow out,
snapped it,

02:10.396 --> 02:12.166
and threw it into
the break-up flames.

02:12.198 --> 02:15.368
Toast a marshmallow
and get on with your life.

02:15.401 --> 02:17.303
I don't have time for this.

02:17.337 --> 02:19.806
I need to get the password
to the Infinity Guard network.

02:19.839 --> 02:23.176
<i>Does someone need the password
to the Infinity Guard network?</i>

02:23.209 --> 02:25.345
- How did you know?
- How did I know?

02:25.379 --> 02:27.648
<i>- I'm always listening.
- Really?</i>

02:27.680 --> 02:29.549
Can you stop that, like, immediately?

02:29.583 --> 02:32.786
<i>Can I?
No, I can't.</i>

02:34.554 --> 02:36.357
There it is, H.U.E.
Zoom in.

02:36.389 --> 02:38.358
<i>The breach has the characteristics</i>

02:38.392 --> 02:41.060
<i>of a black hole,
and it's growing.</i>

02:41.094 --> 02:42.763
You told the Infinity Guard this

02:42.796 --> 02:45.531
and they didn't listen
and they want to arrest you?

02:45.565 --> 02:47.067
They're total bad guys.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.236
That smell coming from
the Infinity Guard kitchen?

02:49.268 --> 02:51.938
A little dish I call
Corruption Stew!

02:51.971 --> 02:54.073
The Infinity Guard is not corrupt.

02:54.107 --> 02:56.410
I get it. You're mad
I broke up with you.

02:56.442 --> 02:59.579
- My patience is whittling away.
- Whittle away, temptress.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.348
Your words can't hurt me anymore.

03:01.381 --> 03:03.339
Wow. How pretty!
What is that?

03:03.374 --> 03:08.388
<i>Plasmic energy is firing from that
planet directly into the breach.</i>

03:08.422 --> 03:11.525
<i>If the laser continues,
the breach will widen,</i>

03:11.558 --> 03:14.094
<i>and Earth will be consumed.</i>

03:14.126 --> 03:16.596
H.U.E., scan that planet
for inhabitants.

03:16.630 --> 03:19.532
<i>That is an Infinity Guard Outpost.</i>

03:19.566 --> 03:22.970
It's not a soup.
It's not a broth.

03:23.002 --> 03:26.139
Oh!
I know. It's a stew!

03:26.173 --> 03:30.911
- Corruption stew!
- There has to be a good explanation.

03:30.943 --> 03:33.380
We're going. H.U.E.,
prime the lightfold engines.

03:33.412 --> 03:35.249
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:35.281 --> 03:38.751
The moment we broke up, that
right went back to el capitan...

03:38.785 --> 03:42.790
- H.U.E., how do we get to the surface?
- ...with a Captain's finesse.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.127
Cutting the engines and gliding in

03:48.161 --> 03:52.399
like a glorious coasting
stealth squirrel was a bad idea!

04:09.189 --> 04:14.506
Good news.
If this is the right place, we're here.

04:15.128 --> 04:18.833
<i>Assessing damage.
The deflector array is offline.</i>

04:18.866 --> 04:23.870
<i>The power cells are offline.
The bake shop is offline.</i>

04:23.903 --> 04:26.139
Wait! There's a bake shop
on this thing?!

04:26.172 --> 04:27.874
Avocato and I will scout on foot.

04:27.907 --> 04:29.677
The rest of you stay back
and repair the ship.

04:29.710 --> 04:32.179
Come on, Avocato, let's go.
What?!

04:32.212 --> 04:34.782
If I could pour
a tall glass of truth-juice

04:34.814 --> 04:38.652
for you real quick, Quinn...
I am not feeling the trust.

04:38.684 --> 04:40.520
I only trust three people
in this world...

04:40.554 --> 04:41.955
my dog, my sister,

04:41.989 --> 04:43.791
and every single member
of the Infinity Guard.

04:43.823 --> 04:47.527
You're insane, my lady.
The Infinity Guard tried to kidnap you.

04:47.561 --> 04:49.496
And they tried to take
over the Galaxy One.

04:49.528 --> 04:51.030
And dogs aren't even people.

04:51.064 --> 04:53.032
I have no reason to trust any of you,

04:53.066 --> 04:56.472
so I'm going with the guy
literally covered in guns.

04:58.237 --> 05:01.241
KVN, fix the ship.
Also, don't touch any of my stuff.

05:01.275 --> 05:04.210
Or Quinn's stuff. Or Avocato's.
Or the cookies. Ju...

05:04.244 --> 05:06.914
Jus... Just don't touch anything.
Specifically buttons.

05:06.946 --> 05:09.148
And especially flamethrowers.

05:09.181 --> 05:11.518
But do fix the ship, and then die.

05:11.551 --> 05:14.221
Okay?
Okay. Okay, come on, Mooncake!

05:14.253 --> 05:19.227
- Wow!
- Ugh.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.402
Hooray!

05:33.040 --> 05:35.408
Watch this.

05:35.441 --> 05:37.578
Stop! Stop staring.

05:37.611 --> 05:40.281
Flamethrowers! Hooray!

05:40.314 --> 05:41.347
I'm burning things!

05:43.744 --> 05:45.271
<i> Aah.</i>

05:49.121 --> 05:50.958
<i>Dad, these are my coordinates.</i>

05:50.991 --> 05:52.726
<i>Come find me.</i>

05:52.758 --> 05:56.396
Stupid thing won't work!

05:56.429 --> 05:58.932
<i>- Be brave.
- Huh?</i>

05:58.965 --> 06:02.523
<i>We're going to get you out of here.</i>

06:04.164 --> 06:08.469
- Why should I trust you?
- We share the same enemy.

06:08.501 --> 06:11.806
I gotta send a message to my father.
Can you amplify my signal?

06:11.839 --> 06:15.109
<i>There's a transmitting station.
I can show you the way.</i>

06:15.142 --> 06:17.187
<i>Now run!</i>

06:22.082 --> 06:23.818
Chocli.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.823
Ooh!

06:40.826 --> 06:43.508
Hey, man... Oh!
Oh, my gosh!

06:43.543 --> 06:45.952
You just don't cleave everybody
in the neck meat, Avocato!

06:45.987 --> 06:49.103
- What the freak?!
- Let me give you some advice, buddy.

06:49.136 --> 06:51.672
- Yes.
- If you want Quinn to trust you,

06:51.704 --> 06:53.773
you gotta step up
and show her you can lead.

06:53.807 --> 06:55.475
Make direct eye contact,

06:55.509 --> 06:59.045
then don't let go until you kiss
her soul with your eyelashes.

06:59.079 --> 07:03.350
Like this.
Too much, or just enough?

07:03.382 --> 07:06.652
Oh, my wow. Oh, my wow!
It's glorious!

07:06.685 --> 07:09.288
- Yeah. So you got it?
- I got it. It's done.

07:09.322 --> 07:10.324
Done and done.

07:10.357 --> 07:15.996
Hi, Quinn.
Too little, or just enough?

07:16.028 --> 07:17.230
Ahhhh!

07:17.384 --> 07:20.086
Just go back to the ship.
You're not a trained soldier.

07:20.119 --> 07:22.855
- You're a... nobody.
- Okay.

07:22.889 --> 07:24.591
I didn't expect that hurt coin deposit

07:24.624 --> 07:26.826
in my sadness savings.
Good Lord.

07:26.860 --> 07:29.295
Look, Gary,
I'm not trying to be mean.

07:29.329 --> 07:31.165
If you get hurt or die...

07:31.197 --> 07:34.033
Well, that's a responsibility
I don't want.

07:34.067 --> 07:36.636
- That's just the truth.
- I don't accept your truth.

07:36.670 --> 07:37.838
And that was incredibly mean.

07:37.870 --> 07:39.438
- I'm sorry.
- I don't think you are.

07:39.471 --> 07:41.607
You're right. I'm not.

07:41.641 --> 07:43.343
You have a bite to you.
I like that.

07:43.376 --> 07:45.712
I promise, you will end up trusting me.

07:45.744 --> 07:48.182
And revel in my awesomeness as I...

07:48.215 --> 07:51.185
karate chop this magnificent...

07:51.218 --> 07:55.533
disturbingly agile...
freaking bug angel!

07:56.655 --> 07:58.158
I think that thing just bit me.

07:58.191 --> 08:00.194
- Ahhhh!
- Holy crap!

08:00.227 --> 08:02.730
It's a beautiful nightmare
shrinking demon!

08:06.400 --> 08:08.402
Aah!

08:08.434 --> 08:10.470
Hoorah!

08:10.502 --> 08:12.038
- Stay with me, Avocato!
- Aah!

08:12.071 --> 08:14.307
I won't rest until a cure is found.

08:16.843 --> 08:20.012
- Mooncake, give Avocato a ride.
- Aah!

08:20.045 --> 08:21.881
Mmm-hmm!

08:21.915 --> 08:25.385
Whoa!

08:25.417 --> 08:29.355
I got your back, Mooncake!
Yee-haw!

08:30.957 --> 08:32.390
What was that?!
I mean, wha... like a little...

08:32.424 --> 08:34.659
a little silly string
shooting out of your gun?

08:34.693 --> 08:37.575
Like...
I mean, that's...

08:37.610 --> 08:39.732
that's like... What were you even
trying to accomplish right there?

08:39.765 --> 08:42.368
I mean...
Okay, foll-follow me!

08:52.045 --> 08:53.780
Spider!
Spider!

08:53.813 --> 08:56.917
It's a spider!

08:56.949 --> 08:58.451
Ohhh, it's a spider!

09:00.453 --> 09:03.089
Aah! Oh!

09:03.122 --> 09:04.123
Aah!

09:04.156 --> 09:07.560
That's weird.
It says we're... here?

09:07.593 --> 09:10.797
Dear Heavenly Lightning Lord!
Are you not seeing this?!

09:10.829 --> 09:15.535
- Seeing what? Ugh.
- It's right here.

09:15.568 --> 09:18.771
Seeing... this.

09:18.805 --> 09:20.838
What the hell is that thing?

09:25.011 --> 09:26.413
Are you talking about the giant laser?

09:26.445 --> 09:28.047
Because if you're talking
about the giant laser,

09:28.080 --> 09:31.083
- it's a giant laser.
- I know it's a giant laser.

09:31.117 --> 09:34.621
Giant doesn't even begin
to describe what I'm seeing.

09:41.493 --> 09:44.130
<i>Laser activation commencing.</i>

09:54.540 --> 09:57.444
That's what's been creating
the gravitational disturbance.

09:57.477 --> 09:59.146
I thought the Earth was being sucked

09:59.179 --> 10:01.448
into a black hole, but I was wrong.

10:01.481 --> 10:03.750
This whole thing is
being orchestrated...

10:03.782 --> 10:05.484
By who?
Or is it whom?

10:05.517 --> 10:09.889
Either way, it's probably
by some serious bad guy.

10:12.025 --> 10:13.694
What a twist!

10:13.727 --> 10:14.995
<i>For the galaxy!</i>

10:15.027 --> 10:18.030
<i>For eternity!
For Lord Commander!</i>

10:18.064 --> 10:22.636
<i>With each blast, we get
closer to Final Space!</i>

10:22.669 --> 10:24.338
<i>So, keep it up.</i>

10:24.371 --> 10:28.475
<i>Good job, Jeff.
Hearing great things.</i>

10:28.507 --> 10:30.142
Yes!

10:30.175 --> 10:32.535
<i>Now, how the hell do I  turn this off?</i>

10:32.570 --> 10:34.944
<i>Eric! How do I turn this off?</i>

10:35.015 --> 10:37.950
<i>Is it the red knob?
Do I turn it left?</i>

10:37.983 --> 10:42.790
<i>Eric, stop crying!
I'm just going to walk away.</i>

10:42.988 --> 10:46.793
The Lord Commander.
He's taken over the Infinity Guard.

10:46.825 --> 10:50.731
- They're destroying Earth. They're...
- Corrupt! Told ya!

10:50.763 --> 10:52.198
Now do you trust me?

10:52.232 --> 10:55.736
No. Now I'm the only person
I can trust.

10:55.769 --> 10:58.839
And Gary. You left out Gary.
And Hot Wheels Avocato.

10:58.872 --> 11:01.875
What I lack in size
I make up for in wisdom.

11:01.907 --> 11:04.978
So now that you're tiny you're
like the new Socrates or something?

11:05.011 --> 11:08.314
Whatever. C'mon, squad!
She needs backup.

11:09.181 --> 11:10.550
Oh, well, I guess not.

11:10.583 --> 11:13.687
I guess I could just sit here
and pop my lips.

11:19.626 --> 11:20.927
♪ Burning love ♪

11:20.959 --> 11:23.596
♪ Burning love, hot burning love ♪

11:23.630 --> 11:26.600
♪ Love, love, love burning love ♪

11:26.632 --> 11:28.200
Beth, I want you to know

11:28.233 --> 11:30.569
that this has been the happiest
moment of KVN's life.

11:30.603 --> 11:33.106
I can see it on your face.
We are so happy.

11:33.138 --> 11:35.074
<i>- She is so hot.
- Stop!</i>

11:35.107 --> 11:37.209
Stop staring.
So creepy.

11:37.242 --> 11:38.944
Now do my bidding!
Fix the ship.

11:38.978 --> 11:41.881
<i>I will kill KVN
and take Beth for my own.</i>

11:41.915 --> 11:43.583
<i>Over my cold, dead hands.</i>

11:43.616 --> 11:45.886
<i>Death fight.
We've got a death fight.</i>

11:45.919 --> 11:47.587
Now, where were we?

11:53.632 --> 11:56.435
How the hell does Jeff do it?

12:02.275 --> 12:03.276
Aah!

12:03.309 --> 12:08.281
- Ugh.
- I told you, I'm doing this on my own.

12:08.314 --> 12:10.617
The hell you are.
Like it or not, we're a team.

12:10.650 --> 12:14.020
And you can't spell "team"
without "M" and "E",

12:14.052 --> 12:16.723
and you know what that spells...
"Us."

12:16.756 --> 12:18.091
- Fine.
- Fine.

12:18.123 --> 12:20.893
A job worth doing is
worth doing together.

12:20.926 --> 12:24.097
- Thank you, Avocato.
- But a vision becomes a nightmare

12:24.129 --> 12:27.099
when the leader has
a big dream and a bad team!

12:27.132 --> 12:29.134
Okay, okay!
Shut up with that stuff.

12:29.167 --> 12:31.203
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

12:31.237 --> 12:33.540
<i>Laser activation in four minutes.</i>

12:33.573 --> 12:36.440
Geez. Oh, my gosh.

12:36.809 --> 12:41.204
Superior Stone, that bastard.

12:42.348 --> 12:45.384
Come on, we're running out of time.
We gotta go around.

12:48.454 --> 12:52.173
Ohhhh, crap.

12:54.093 --> 12:57.464
- Aah! Laser hell...
- Shhh! The walls are thin.

12:57.497 --> 12:59.632
Do not make a sound, or they'll hear us!

12:59.666 --> 13:01.401
You expect us... Ow!...

13:01.434 --> 13:03.269
to climb through
this electric pain-maze

13:03.301 --> 13:05.638
without making a sound?
We're not wizards.

13:05.671 --> 13:09.175
- Ow!
- Will everyone please shut up!

13:09.208 --> 13:11.645
- Aah!
- Okay! We'll do it your...

13:11.677 --> 13:12.778
Ohhhhh!

13:12.811 --> 13:15.281
Aa-ga-gaah!
Aa-ga-gaah!

13:15.314 --> 13:17.617
Right on the downstairs mustache.

13:17.650 --> 13:19.819
Do you not see
this is the worst possible

13:19.852 --> 13:22.789
- ti-i-i-ime... for this?!
- Tuff titty whompas!

13:22.821 --> 13:24.523
- Company hold.
- Titty whompas!

13:24.556 --> 13:27.493
- Did you hear that?
- Sounded like "tuff titty whompas."

13:27.526 --> 13:30.530
What the hell is
a tuff titty whompas?

13:30.563 --> 13:34.034
- It's probably a rat.
- Do rats say "tuff titty whompas"?

13:34.066 --> 13:36.567
The big ones do.

13:38.805 --> 13:41.007
Oh!

13:42.842 --> 13:44.210
Oh, my God! Aah!

13:44.243 --> 13:48.514
You're like a tiny little
Avocato bobble head!

13:48.547 --> 13:49.782
Aah!

13:54.010 --> 13:56.955
Alert!
Escapee. Lock it down!

14:00.892 --> 14:02.661
- Now run!
- Ya think?

14:06.331 --> 14:09.602
<i>Laser activation in 90 seconds.</i>

14:13.271 --> 14:15.007
Have you all lost your minds?!

14:15.041 --> 14:18.244
You're working for the Lord Commander!
We're Infinity Guard...

14:18.276 --> 14:20.412
the last vestige of hope
in the universe.

14:20.445 --> 14:25.418
What you're doing here is going
to destroy the Earth, our home.

14:25.450 --> 14:28.420
Stop this.
I'm begging you.

14:28.454 --> 14:33.592
- Stop.
- That's a good speech, but, nah.

14:33.626 --> 14:34.394
Nah, ain't happening.

14:40.134 --> 14:43.070
<i>- No way!
- Yeah, no, we're not stopping.</i>

14:44.237 --> 14:46.455
You know what to do, Avocato.
Hoorah!

14:52.945 --> 14:56.849
I'm back, baby!
Whoo! Yeah!

14:56.882 --> 14:59.352
I'm electrified, baby!

14:59.385 --> 15:02.956
Whoo! Murder Beam activate!
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

15:02.988 --> 15:06.792
I go high, you go low!
Yes!

15:09.661 --> 15:12.031
Yeah! Gary, how're them
guns back there?

15:12.064 --> 15:14.668
They're hot, baby!

15:16.802 --> 15:17.970
Yes!

15:26.311 --> 15:28.882
Stone! You traitor!

15:28.915 --> 15:33.419
What I do, I do for the Infinity Guard!

15:33.451 --> 15:35.988
You double-crossing sphincter sack.

15:36.021 --> 15:40.893
Quinn, you can still join us.
You're just about the only one

15:40.926 --> 15:46.166
who hasn't pledged allegiance
to the Lord Commander.

15:46.199 --> 15:49.169
Don't do it, Quinn!
Don't do it!

15:49.201 --> 15:51.670
We have such
a good thing going here!

15:51.704 --> 15:54.140
I'm not joining him,
you freaking weirdo.

15:54.172 --> 15:57.976
Don't join forces with this guy!

15:58.010 --> 16:01.480
- Don't do it!
- Why are you doing this?

16:01.513 --> 16:04.616
The Lord Commander has seen
what's on the other side.

16:04.650 --> 16:07.587
Once we break into Final Space,

16:07.619 --> 16:10.789
we'll flood the world with light,

16:10.823 --> 16:14.194
and there will be no more death.

16:14.227 --> 16:16.362
That's because there
will be no more life.

16:16.395 --> 16:19.199
At first.
But not at second.

16:19.232 --> 16:22.035
And don't even get me
started on thirdly.

16:22.068 --> 16:25.505
Anyway, Quinn,
we should thank you.

16:25.537 --> 16:28.390
- What?
- Your scribbling on a bar napkin

16:28.436 --> 16:30.709
allowed us to finally break
through the quantum barriers

16:30.743 --> 16:33.213
and tear through this universe.

16:33.246 --> 16:36.716
So you see, this is all your work.

16:39.064 --> 16:43.871
_

16:48.087 --> 16:49.390
Cheer up.

16:49.423 --> 16:53.059
You won't have to live
with the guilt much longer...

16:55.227 --> 16:57.096
...because now
there's no stopping us

16:57.130 --> 17:01.335
from tearing a hole
into Final Space.

17:01.367 --> 17:04.369
<i>Commencing laser fire in 30 seconds.</i>

17:04.404 --> 17:07.707
Hey, sphincter sack!
Rock, paper, scissors.

17:07.741 --> 17:09.710
I'm not playing this game.

17:09.742 --> 17:12.611
Close! Paper!

17:15.214 --> 17:17.416
Aah!

17:17.451 --> 17:21.121
Guy just got sucked
into a big ol' butthole.

17:21.154 --> 17:23.021
Gary, we got a laser to take out.

17:23.056 --> 17:26.559
- O-O-Okay! Okay, let's go!
- It's all my fault.

17:26.593 --> 17:31.064
- Quinn, it's not your fault.
- I can't even trust myself anymore.

17:31.097 --> 17:33.733
Okay, you're digging deep,
and there's some real powerful

17:33.767 --> 17:35.269
self-discovery stuff going on here,

17:35.301 --> 17:37.937
but there's a giant laser about to fire,

17:37.971 --> 17:40.039
so if we could just stick a pin in this

17:40.073 --> 17:41.909
and pick it up
over snacks soon-ish?

17:41.942 --> 17:44.979
<i>Laser activation in 10 seconds.</i>

17:45.011 --> 17:48.048
Stone shot out the controls.
The laser can't be stopped.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.983
<i>Laser activation commencing now.</i>

17:50.017 --> 17:51.218
Mooncake, shoot the laser!

17:51.250 --> 17:52.920
- Are you crazy?
- Yes! Shoot the laser!

17:52.952 --> 17:54.054
- Chocli.
- Shoot the laser!

17:54.087 --> 17:55.088
- Chocli?
- Shoot the laser!

17:55.122 --> 17:56.423
- Chocli!
- Shoot it! Shoot it!

17:56.455 --> 17:58.424
<i>- Shoot the laser!
- Chocli!</i>

18:07.834 --> 18:11.172
Ooh...
- Oh. My. Crap.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.649
The elevator! Hurry!

18:22.014 --> 18:23.316
Tuff titty whompas!

18:23.349 --> 18:26.153
KVN? H.U.E.? We need
an emergency extraction!

18:29.722 --> 18:32.291
Whoa!
Mooncake!

18:42.836 --> 18:44.038
Aah!

18:47.979 --> 18:50.476
We're going to die!

18:50.510 --> 18:55.215
- Not if you trust me.
- I'm sorry. I can't.

18:55.248 --> 18:59.153
- I think you can.
- Okay.

18:59.185 --> 19:04.040
Okay. And don't worry.
I have one of these.

19:04.356 --> 19:08.127
Aaah!

19:08.161 --> 19:11.398
Aah! Why would they
connect the nerve endings

19:11.431 --> 19:15.334
to my robot hand?!
Aah!

19:15.367 --> 19:16.537
Whyyyy?!

19:18.605 --> 19:21.541
Whoa!

19:21.575 --> 19:22.742
Aah!

19:22.776 --> 19:25.079
Aah! Whoa!

19:25.112 --> 19:28.347
<i>When I woke up this morning,
I did not think, "I'm going to die."</i>

19:28.381 --> 19:31.485
<i>But look at us.
Look at me, look at her.</i>

19:31.518 --> 19:35.154
<i>Here we are. A unit.
Dying together.</i>

19:35.187 --> 19:37.857
<i>Oh, no, wait!
Look, the Galaxy One! Yeah!</i>

19:37.891 --> 19:39.393
Aah!

19:39.425 --> 19:41.861
Oh!

19:48.769 --> 19:50.069
You came through.

19:50.103 --> 19:53.140
<i>I told you...
we fight the same war.</i>

19:54.741 --> 19:57.376
But it's key locked.

19:57.410 --> 20:00.914
<i>4-3-7-2-8.</i>

20:02.081 --> 20:04.784
I'm in.
Thanks. I owe you.

20:04.818 --> 20:07.253
<i>Dad, these are my coordinates.
Come find me.</i>

20:07.287 --> 20:10.057
<i>I mean, at your leisure, but
like, for me, preferably fast.</i>

20:10.089 --> 20:11.257
<i>That'd be great.</i>

20:11.290 --> 20:12.725
And... send!

20:12.759 --> 20:15.762
<i>You did it! You did!</i>

20:15.796 --> 20:18.899
<i>You... You did it!</i>

20:18.932 --> 20:24.037
<i>You sent your father
and Mooncake right to me.</i>

20:24.069 --> 20:26.240
No, no, no, no, nooooo!

20:39.019 --> 20:41.822
What, uh...
what are you doing?

20:41.855 --> 20:44.825
Starting over.
You were right about everything.

20:44.857 --> 20:46.960
I know.
It's a blessing.

20:46.992 --> 20:49.061
And my curse.

20:49.095 --> 20:51.097
If the Lord Commander
corrupted the Infinity Guard

20:51.131 --> 20:54.101
it means there's no good guys left.

20:54.134 --> 20:56.770
- Yes, there are.
- Who?

20:56.802 --> 20:57.937
- Us.
- Chocli.

20:57.971 --> 21:02.608
Healthy people trust.
We need more of that, not less.

21:02.642 --> 21:06.646
- But how can I?
- You begin right here...

21:08.949 --> 21:10.951
...with this guy.

21:10.983 --> 21:16.455
- We're the good guys now.
- Okay, then.

21:16.489 --> 21:20.527
- Us.
- Yeah. Us.

21:21.559 --> 21:23.429
<i>Oh, KVN!</i>
