00:00.043 --> 00:02.689
Previously on
<i>"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

00:02.741 --> 00:03.770
What kind of egg is that?

00:03.850 --> 00:06.650
- It's a dragon egg.
- Oh.

00:07.490 --> 00:09.520
Okay, you got
possessed by Neron.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.980
I can't stop!

00:12.060 --> 00:13.520
I give up.
Do you hear me, Neron?

00:13.530 --> 00:15.660
Spare Nate
and I'll let you have me.

00:17.750 --> 00:21.000
- Neron?
- I can make you whole again.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.160
- My nipple.
- Gary, no!

00:27.620 --> 00:28.920
Nora, I need your help.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.670
I am asking you
to face another demon

00:30.740 --> 00:32.040
<i>as a member of the Time Bureau.</i>

00:32.049 --> 00:33.210
Let's do this.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.050
All right,
enough of the sightseeing.

00:42.130 --> 00:43.420
Can we go now?

00:43.500 --> 00:45.430
I'm a bit knackered,
to be honest with you, mate.

00:45.440 --> 00:46.770
We're not here as tourists,
Johnny.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.100
Ah, right, you're
gonna get rid of me

00:48.180 --> 00:49.730
in some dramatic fashion.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.350
Get on with it, will you?

00:51.430 --> 00:53.780
I'm not gonna kill you.
Not yet, anyway.

00:53.860 --> 00:55.940
I need you for a favor.
Is that right?

00:55.950 --> 00:58.240
Mm, I need you to open up
a doorway to hell.

00:58.310 --> 01:01.290
Oh, right.
Well, why didn't you say so?

01:01.370 --> 01:04.450
I will gladly open up
a vortex right here

01:04.459 --> 01:07.240
and give you the old heave-ho
to the great beyond.

01:07.320 --> 01:09.540
The door is not for me, Johnny.

01:09.610 --> 01:12.540
It's to bring someone here
from the other side.

01:12.620 --> 01:15.290
Tabitha.
Ah, that's right.

01:15.370 --> 01:16.800
If she comes straight
through the doorway,

01:16.880 --> 01:19.090
she doesn't need a human vessel.

01:19.170 --> 01:21.230
And what in that demented
demon brain of yours

01:21.300 --> 01:23.890
makes you think that I'm going
to open a vortex for you, eh?

01:23.960 --> 01:26.600
Unlike Gary,
I've still got both my nipples,

01:26.670 --> 01:28.100
so you don't have much
to bargain with.

01:28.180 --> 01:30.140
Speaking of which,

01:30.150 --> 01:31.430
what have you done
with the Muppet?

01:31.510 --> 01:32.890
Gary's just fine.

01:32.970 --> 01:35.980
He's back at the Time Bureau
taking care of business.

01:41.020 --> 01:42.990
<i>Okay, Nora, you can do this.</i>

01:43.000 --> 01:46.410
Just... be normal.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.830
You can be normal.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.340
'Cause you are normal.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.580
- Next.
- Come on!

01:53.700 --> 01:55.670
That's your ID picture?

01:55.680 --> 01:57.170
They wouldn't let me retake it.

01:57.180 --> 01:59.630
Oh, it can't be that bad.
Let me see.

02:02.060 --> 02:06.690
Uh, maybe we'll just use your
photo from the wanted poster.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.970
So your ID is in process.

02:09.050 --> 02:11.360
And you have me to help you
with your orientation.

02:11.440 --> 02:12.530
All that's left is this.

02:13.640 --> 02:14.940
What the hell's that?

02:15.010 --> 02:16.060
It's your start paperwork.

02:16.140 --> 02:19.270
No, I should be out
looking for Ray.

02:19.290 --> 02:20.780
I really have to fill
all this out?

02:20.850 --> 02:21.990
I know.
I know, Nora.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.200
But until we have
a line on Neron,

02:23.210 --> 02:24.450
there's really nothing
we can do.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.610
And let's be honest, Nora.

02:25.690 --> 02:27.870
You have a storied history here.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.950
I need you to prove that you
can be a team player.

02:31.030 --> 02:32.170
Have fun.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.370
Oh, and you know what, Nora?

02:37.330 --> 02:38.540
I'm really, really proud of you.

02:40.170 --> 02:41.420
Welcome to the Bureau.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.850
Director Sharpe.
I've been waiting for you.

02:52.930 --> 02:54.180
Gary, I told you,
no playing with my chair

02:54.260 --> 02:55.400
until after hours.

02:55.480 --> 02:57.520
Oh, playtime's over.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.280
Shut the door.

02:59.360 --> 03:00.980
We need to talk.

<i>If Neron wanted John dead,</i>

03:10.160 --> 03:12.200
<i>he would have killed him
on the spot.</i>

03:12.280 --> 03:13.920
He must need something from him.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.420
We have to find them before
he can get what he wants.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.010
Who knows what he's doing
in Ray's name...

03:18.090 --> 03:20.590
or his perfectly grass-fed
organic butter body?

03:20.600 --> 03:21.920
If Haircut's even there.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.490
We don't know that Ray is gone.

03:23.490 --> 03:25.510
Look, everybody just breathe.
Gideon's already on it.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.510
<i>I've attuned the magic-o-meter</i>

03:26.580 --> 03:28.270
<i>to Constantine's frequency.</i>

03:28.350 --> 03:30.930
<i>When he uses his abilities,
I can zero in on his location.</i>

03:30.940 --> 03:32.270
And what do we do till then?

03:32.350 --> 03:33.850
- Stress eat.
- Drink.

03:33.860 --> 03:35.430
Yeah, how'd you lot
survive until now?

03:35.440 --> 03:37.440
Look, until we get an alert,
we wait.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.600
Right, we wait.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.730
I gotta go clear my head.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.860
<i>What do you think this is about?</i>

03:45.940 --> 03:47.900
With everything
that's been going on,

03:47.980 --> 03:51.370
I bet Director Sharpe is about
to lay down the plan of attack.

03:53.080 --> 03:55.130
I've gathered you here because
today we're setting time aside

03:55.210 --> 03:57.040
to conduct performance reviews.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.870
But this time, I thought
it would be useful

03:58.950 --> 04:00.630
if you were assessed
by one of your peers,

04:00.710 --> 04:02.420
Agent Gary Green.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.470
Gary?

04:04.550 --> 04:05.560
- Seriously?
- Huh?

04:05.630 --> 04:06.880
Thanks, doll.

04:09.310 --> 04:10.800
How are my babies doing?

04:10.810 --> 04:12.390
Let's rap for a sec.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.010
Is Gary cool now?

04:14.090 --> 04:15.560
That's impossible.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.600
Now, I know performance
reviews can be quite a drag,

04:18.680 --> 04:20.320
but this year's gonna be
different 'cause you've got

04:20.399 --> 04:22.610
superagent Gary Green
in your corner.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.230
So no need to stress...

04:24.310 --> 04:26.900
unless your infraction is
looking too good in that suit.

04:26.980 --> 04:29.160
Agent Reyes knows
what I'm talking about.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.820
Oh, my God.
I think she just swooned.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.160
This is a nightmare.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.830
So I'll be meeting
with agents one-on-one,

04:35.900 --> 04:37.880
and, uh, wait till
I call your name.

04:38.870 --> 04:41.170
Looking forward
to some good face time.

04:44.510 --> 04:47.130
Ava, are you sure
this is the best time

04:47.210 --> 04:48.670
for performance reviews?

04:48.680 --> 04:50.050
There's no better time
to assess the performance

04:50.060 --> 04:51.510
of our operation.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.760
But are you sure
Gary's qualified for...

04:53.840 --> 04:55.180
responsibilities?

04:55.190 --> 04:56.860
Of course, Mona.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.810
Gary Green
is all the man we need.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:08.200 --> 05:12.860
Oh, my, what a big,
scary knife you've got.

05:12.880 --> 05:16.040
I'd sooner be filleted
than do your bidding.

05:16.120 --> 05:19.120
This knife is not for you.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.500
It's for Raymond.

05:21.570 --> 05:23.460
The human body is fascinating.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.130
Delicate, fragile.

05:26.540 --> 05:28.510
Did you know that if I cut
this artery right here,

05:28.580 --> 05:30.510
it will take only
a matter of minutes

05:30.580 --> 05:32.840
before Ray's body
goes into shock

05:32.920 --> 05:35.800
and eventually expires?

05:35.880 --> 05:37.180
Hey, big man.

05:37.260 --> 05:38.220
Come on.
I know you're in there.

05:38.230 --> 05:40.190
Snap out of it, eh?

05:40.270 --> 05:41.480
Ray's gone.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.440
I've taken over his body.
We made a deal.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.560
And you of all people
should know what it means

05:46.580 --> 05:48.860
to make a deal with a demon.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.900
Now, if Ray was still in here,

05:50.910 --> 05:52.860
would he do this?

06:00.740 --> 06:02.410
I knew I could make you
use your magic.

06:02.420 --> 06:05.220
Great, yeah.
So you got me.

06:06.410 --> 06:08.210
What's that big grin
all about, eh?

06:08.220 --> 06:09.760
Patience.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.410
You'll see.

06:15.420 --> 06:17.680
Huh, I always took you
to be more Springsteen

06:17.760 --> 06:19.390
than "The Rite of Spring."

06:19.470 --> 06:23.020
It's not for me.
It's...

06:23.090 --> 06:27.110
I read that classical music
is good for babies.

06:27.190 --> 06:29.280
Wow, this is very,
um, impressive.

06:30.510 --> 06:31.610
Yeah, I found a book
about dragons

06:31.620 --> 06:34.070
in Constantine's collection.

06:35.790 --> 06:37.780
"The egg must incubate
under the mother

06:37.790 --> 06:40.450
at her body temperature
lest the egg expire."

06:40.460 --> 06:42.200
Yeah, I'm not gonna sit
on that thing.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.290
I figured as much.
That's why I got a heat lamp.

06:45.780 --> 06:50.880
We have to do
everything possible

06:50.960 --> 06:53.420
to make sure nothing bad
happens to this egg.

06:55.670 --> 06:57.690
- Hey.
- Hmm?

06:57.760 --> 06:59.810
The egg's gonna be okay.

06:59.890 --> 07:01.150
I know it.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.390
Wait till Ray sees
that we have a dragon.

07:03.470 --> 07:06.230
- He's gonna love it.
- Yeah.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.560
<i>I've picked up an alert</i>

07:07.640 --> 07:09.480
<i>with Constantine's
magical signature.</i>

07:09.490 --> 07:11.900
That's them.

07:11.980 --> 07:14.570
<i>The signal is coming
from 1.3 million years ago.</i>

07:14.650 --> 07:15.890
That's the Ice Age.

07:15.890 --> 07:17.410
<i>He's in the part
of North America</i>

07:17.480 --> 07:19.060
<i>that would come to be known
as the Donner Pass,</i>

07:19.060 --> 07:21.080
<i>named after a doomed group
of settlers in the 1800s</i>

07:21.150 --> 07:22.450
<i>who resorted to cannibalism</i>

07:22.530 --> 07:23.910
<i>after their food supplies
ran out.</i>

07:23.990 --> 07:26.920
There is such thing
as too much exposition, Gideon.

07:33.260 --> 07:36.590
Hah, there they are.
Our heroes.

07:43.510 --> 07:46.850
<i>Captain Lance, thanks
for coming all this way.</i>

07:46.860 --> 07:48.520
<i>If you're looking for Ray,</i>

07:48.600 --> 07:50.240
he's, uh, checked out.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.810
Is Neron on comms?

07:51.890 --> 07:53.360
<i>But if you'd like to join him,</i>

07:53.370 --> 07:54.480
I can make arrangements.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.280
Sara, open fire now.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.870
<i>This may be your only chance.</i>

07:57.950 --> 07:59.110
We can't fire.
That's Ray.

07:59.190 --> 08:01.040
Ray made a deal with a demon.
He's gone.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.040
<i>We can't lose anyone else
to this bastard.</i>

08:03.120 --> 08:04.660
<i>Do it.</i>
What about you?

08:04.740 --> 08:06.450
Blow us both to kingdom come.

08:06.530 --> 08:08.510
I'll be happy to go to hell
for the cause.

08:08.580 --> 08:10.830
Gideon, ready the blasters.

08:10.910 --> 08:11.830
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

08:11.910 --> 08:13.280
Whoa, whoa.
Hold up!

08:13.280 --> 08:16.460
If we kill Neron in Ray's body,
we lose Ray forever.

08:16.540 --> 08:18.520
But if you let Neron walk,
then things are gonna get

08:18.590 --> 08:20.640
much, much worse.
Trust me.

08:21.690 --> 08:24.510
Sara?
Well, come on, boss.

08:26.980 --> 08:28.310
Something's wrong.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.190
<i>Awaiting orders, Captain.</i>

08:30.260 --> 08:31.560
Gideon...

08:31.570 --> 08:33.200
Fire.

08:36.820 --> 08:37.780
It's a trap!

08:50.260 --> 08:51.250
We gotta move!
They're getting away!

08:51.330 --> 08:52.590
Get us out of here, Gideon!

08:55.420 --> 08:56.380
That's not good.

08:56.460 --> 08:57.960
<i>By my calculations,</i>

08:58.040 --> 09:00.760
<i>we're buried beneath
357 feet of ice and snow.</i>

09:00.840 --> 09:02.860
<i>Plus, our primary temporal
delineator has been rendered</i>

09:02.930 --> 09:05.020
<i>nonfunctional
with the extreme weather.</i>

09:05.030 --> 09:06.860
Well, so that's it, then?
We're just snowed in?

09:06.940 --> 09:08.350
Yeah, at the Donner Pass.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.400
No one's turning me
into beef jerky!

09:10.470 --> 09:13.110
Everyone calm down.
Gideon, hail the Bureau.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.880
Should we leave a voice mail?

09:26.960 --> 09:29.540
Ava will get the alert.
In the meantime, we wait.

09:29.550 --> 09:31.380
Gideon, how long
until the ice thaws?

09:31.450 --> 09:34.250
<i>The Ice Age ends
in 11,121 years.</i>

09:34.260 --> 09:35.380
All right, who we eating first?

09:35.460 --> 09:36.800
'Cause shotgun, not.

09:36.870 --> 09:38.800
<i>Captain, we're running
on reserve power.</i>

09:38.880 --> 09:40.550
<i>I recommend disabling
all nonessential functions</i>

09:40.560 --> 09:42.390
<i>to conserve energy
for life support.</i>

09:42.470 --> 09:43.790
Do it.

09:43.790 --> 09:46.010
We need to be responsible
and conserve power.

09:46.090 --> 09:48.890
Cut off the main generator,
the fabricator,

09:48.900 --> 09:50.100
and the thermostat.

09:50.180 --> 09:52.810
Neron is out there
with Ray and Constantine

09:52.890 --> 09:55.820
all because we fell for his
trap because you fired on Ray.

09:55.890 --> 09:57.690
And what was your plan, pretty?

09:57.770 --> 09:59.580
Beat him to death
in a snowball fight?

09:59.660 --> 10:00.990
We were supposed to take him in,

10:01.060 --> 10:03.320
not take him out, Mick.
Ray's gone!

10:03.400 --> 10:05.250
When a team member goes dark,

10:05.330 --> 10:07.700
you end them
before they end you.

10:11.750 --> 10:13.040
Rory, with me.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.170
You made the call.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.710
You're helping us
get out of here.

10:15.790 --> 10:18.420
- No problem.
- All right.

10:18.430 --> 10:20.880
Always assumed
I'd go out alone, anyway.

10:26.630 --> 10:28.270
First you kill my friends,
and now you bring me

10:28.350 --> 10:29.890
to this miserable era.

10:29.970 --> 10:32.110
Oh, Johnny,
quit being such a crybaby.

10:32.190 --> 10:34.100
I just did what I had to do.

10:34.120 --> 10:35.950
Can't have your friends
getting in the way of us

10:36.020 --> 10:37.190
creating that door to hell.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.360
There's still no way
I'm helping you.

10:39.440 --> 10:42.070
Besides, the vortexes I make
are strictly one-way.

10:42.150 --> 10:44.120
They suck you in.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.370
And don't you think,
if my magic was powerful enough

10:46.440 --> 10:48.870
to stabilize a vortex,
I wouldn't have saved Desmond

10:48.950 --> 10:50.250
or Astra?

10:50.320 --> 10:53.120
Yes, and that's why we're here.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.920
As powerful as your magic is,
you can always teach

10:55.990 --> 10:58.970
an old dog new tricks.

10:59.050 --> 11:01.470
And it's more than magic
that you need to learn.

11:01.480 --> 11:02.760
Oh, yeah, right.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.590
So I'm supposed to learn
something off one

11:04.670 --> 11:06.260
of these yokels, am I?

11:06.340 --> 11:07.890
No, Johnny.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.760
Not from them.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.600
From a king.

11:15.010 --> 11:18.270
Hold on a minute.
That bloke's got my face.

11:18.350 --> 11:20.070
That's because
he's your ancestor.

11:20.140 --> 11:22.990
King Konstentyn,
ruler of these parts

11:23.000 --> 11:25.660
and progenitor
of your magical bloodline.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.950
What kind of creature
do you think they're hunting?

11:31.030 --> 11:32.160
Can't be sure,

11:32.170 --> 11:34.010
but I'm guessing
it wasn't rabbits.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.500
Make way for your king!

11:39.970 --> 11:41.960
Start paperwork, am I right?

11:42.040 --> 11:45.130
My forms keep getting
rejected because records show

11:45.210 --> 11:48.010
I'm 15 and living
in a mental institution.

11:48.020 --> 11:51.900
I forget that we don't
have normal problems anymore.

11:51.980 --> 11:55.020
Speaking of which,
Ava's having Gary

11:55.030 --> 11:57.270
do performance reviews.
Okay.

11:57.350 --> 12:00.520
I mean, he's not my first
choice for... responsibilities,

12:00.530 --> 12:01.650
but don't we have bigger issues?

12:01.730 --> 12:02.980
Exactly.

12:03.060 --> 12:05.040
And when I pointed that out,
Ava shut me down.

12:05.110 --> 12:06.990
Not to stereotype,
but I think a clone

12:07.070 --> 12:09.160
might have replaced her,
and we need to look into it.

12:09.230 --> 12:10.160
- No.
- Yes.

12:10.240 --> 12:11.160
- No.
- Yes.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.160
- No!
- Yes!

12:12.240 --> 12:14.170
No!
I just earned my freedom.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.460
And I don't wanna get caught
going behind Ava's back.

12:16.530 --> 12:17.830
You heard what she said.

12:17.910 --> 12:19.380
I need to focus on being
a team player.

12:19.390 --> 12:22.130
She said Gary
is all the man we need.

12:22.210 --> 12:24.170
That's not weird to you?

12:24.250 --> 12:26.310
Why is that weird?

12:26.390 --> 12:28.390
Gary Green
<i>is</i> all the man we need.

12:32.730 --> 12:35.480
Okay, I will check on Gary,

12:35.550 --> 12:39.020
and you contact the Waverider
and see if Sara knows anything.

12:39.100 --> 12:41.240
- Mm-hmm.
- And then...

12:41.320 --> 12:44.150
we're gonna find out
what form 37-C is.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.150
Okay.

12:52.490 --> 12:54.240
Ah, this is useless!

12:54.260 --> 12:56.040
Why don't we just
blast a way out?

12:56.110 --> 12:57.910
<i>Using your heat gun in here,
Mr. Rory,</i>

12:57.930 --> 12:59.550
<i>will deplete our low supply
of oxygen.</i>

12:59.630 --> 13:00.760
Yeah, ease up, Mick.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.170
Last time you pulled
the trigger,

13:02.250 --> 13:04.170
we ended up here.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.010
You're pissed at me
for firing on Haircut.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.510
Well, it's a good thing
that this Snart bloke

13:07.580 --> 13:09.380
kept a supply of jackets,
though, isn't it?

13:09.460 --> 13:10.680
They smell good too, actually.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.550
What is that?
Is it sandalwood?

13:12.630 --> 13:14.010
Look, I'm pissed at you
because that

13:14.090 --> 13:16.320
wasn't your call to make.
Someone had to make it.

13:16.390 --> 13:18.390
It was our only chance
to take out Neron.

13:18.470 --> 13:20.190
I made the call you should have.

13:20.260 --> 13:22.440
All right, guys, come on.
Just pick away, will you?

13:22.450 --> 13:23.730
No, this is good.

13:23.810 --> 13:27.240
All of a sudden,
now you care about the mission?

13:27.310 --> 13:30.070
Where were you when Neron
took Ray in the first place?

13:30.150 --> 13:31.740
Oh, you're gonna put that
on me as well!

13:31.820 --> 13:33.830
All right, as much as I wanna
watch you guys duke it out,

13:33.900 --> 13:36.040
lets save it for when
we're not freezing to death.

13:36.110 --> 13:37.520
You know what?

13:37.520 --> 13:40.260
Both of you off scamming people
at some book convention

13:40.330 --> 13:42.340
while there is a demon
on our ship.

13:42.420 --> 13:44.710
Mm, let me get
this straight, Captain.

13:44.790 --> 13:47.810
You're the only one that can
have fun outside of this

13:47.880 --> 13:49.760
rusted bucket of bolts?

13:49.830 --> 13:51.810
All you do is spend time
with the girlfriend

13:51.890 --> 13:55.060
and nothing's ever,
ever your fault!

13:56.820 --> 13:57.810
You know what?

13:57.820 --> 13:59.100
You have all the answers.

14:00.560 --> 14:01.900
You get us out of here.

14:04.070 --> 14:08.330
Oh, when I was a boy,
we used to run wild

14:08.400 --> 14:10.660
in these woods
around the village.

14:10.740 --> 14:12.830
Not a care in the world.

14:14.240 --> 14:18.580
These same woods where
your children play today

14:18.660 --> 14:20.750
and where my hunting party
just encountered

14:20.820 --> 14:25.000
another dangerous beast that
threatens not just our safety

14:25.010 --> 14:27.630
but our entire way of life.

14:27.710 --> 14:30.670
Oh, this bloke is right tedious.

14:30.680 --> 14:32.180
Why are we here?

14:32.250 --> 14:34.140
Because I want you to learn

14:34.210 --> 14:36.360
that it was your ancestor
that created the rift

14:36.430 --> 14:39.180
between humans
and magical creatures.

14:39.190 --> 14:41.360
And why would he do that?

14:41.440 --> 14:44.940
Because fear is a powerful
source of energy for magic.

14:45.010 --> 14:47.480
The more he exploits these
creatures to stir up fear

14:47.560 --> 14:49.370
in his people, the more powerful

14:49.440 --> 14:51.160
his magic becomes.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.110
I come from a long line
of bastards,

14:53.190 --> 14:54.870
but not even we
would resort to that.

14:54.950 --> 14:57.040
Because your kin
are always so right.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.380
Yes.

14:58.450 --> 15:00.290
And if the king is sending
this creature to hell,

15:00.360 --> 15:03.050
then surely it deserves it.

15:03.130 --> 15:04.830
Do you really think
that everyone in hell

15:04.910 --> 15:06.290
deserves to be there?

15:06.370 --> 15:07.960
What about Astra

15:08.040 --> 15:09.800
or Raymond Palmer

15:09.870 --> 15:11.170
or my Tabitha?

15:11.250 --> 15:14.130
This is your opportunity
to make things right,

15:14.210 --> 15:15.730
starting with her.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.720
You know, if your plan
is to guilt me

15:17.730 --> 15:19.900
into doing what you want
by showing me the sins

15:19.980 --> 15:23.640
of my forefather,
it ain't working, sunshine.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.850
But to another.

15:25.930 --> 15:29.400
Behold the unholy beast!

15:31.900 --> 15:33.900
Hold on a minute.
That's a Púca.

15:33.910 --> 15:38.320
May not look threatening,
but sometimes

15:38.400 --> 15:42.450
in order to see
the true nature of a creature,

15:42.460 --> 15:44.540
one must draw it out.

15:45.910 --> 15:47.080
No, no, no.
He's got it all wrong.

15:47.090 --> 15:48.760
They aren't evil.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.550
Guess your bloodline isn't as
righteous as you think it is.

15:51.620 --> 15:53.800
He's clearly misinformed.

15:53.810 --> 15:55.720
Well, if you think that,
maybe you should go

15:55.790 --> 15:57.550
and have a chat with the king.

15:57.630 --> 16:00.390
You are truly blessed
that I am here,

16:00.470 --> 16:04.480
for I alone can save you
from these monsters.

16:04.560 --> 16:07.900
And tonight at the rise
of the low moon,

16:07.970 --> 16:13.110
I will banish this creature
straight to hell.

16:22.270 --> 16:24.360
<i>Agent Powell,
please report to my office</i>

16:24.370 --> 16:25.690
<i>for your performance review.</i>

16:37.270 --> 16:40.050
Just need a signal
on the Waverider.

16:41.460 --> 16:42.710
That's weird.

16:46.310 --> 16:48.380
What are you doing in here?

16:48.460 --> 16:52.720
Uh, just thought I would
check on the timeline.

16:52.730 --> 16:55.230
Yep, looks good.

16:55.310 --> 16:56.480
You have clearance for this?

16:56.560 --> 16:57.850
Have you completed
your performance review?

17:01.890 --> 17:04.520
Yes, I've had
my performance review.

17:04.599 --> 17:07.400
And how did it go?

17:09.440 --> 17:13.530
Gary Green
is all the man we need.

17:13.609 --> 17:15.750
Gary Green
is all the man we need.

17:15.829 --> 17:17.329
Mm.

17:22.740 --> 17:24.619
Nora!

17:24.640 --> 17:26.250
You were right.
We have to talk.

17:26.260 --> 17:27.710
But we can't do it here.

17:30.420 --> 17:31.720
The heat lamp
must have turned off

17:31.790 --> 17:33.840
when Sara shut down
the generator.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.680
It's okay, Wickstable.
You're gonna be okay.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.110
What... what did you call it?

17:39.610 --> 17:40.850
Wickstable.

17:40.930 --> 17:43.440
The drawing I made
of Heyworld when I was a kid,

17:43.450 --> 17:45.440
the one that inspired my dad,
the dragon in it,

17:45.450 --> 17:47.270
I named it Wickstable.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.230
I thought we could
just name it that.

17:49.310 --> 17:51.190
But I'm open to other ideas.

17:51.270 --> 17:54.030
No, uh, I-I like...
I like Wickstable.

17:56.070 --> 17:58.870
Our little Wicksty.

18:01.110 --> 18:02.370
I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

18:02.450 --> 18:03.910
but I think it needs
skin-to-skin contact

18:03.990 --> 18:05.630
like the book said.

18:11.460 --> 18:14.510
I think it's working.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.220
Hey, uh, why does it feel
like we skipped past

18:18.300 --> 18:22.100
all the fun stuff
into, you know, this?

18:22.180 --> 18:23.930
We can still do the fun stuff.

18:29.890 --> 18:31.070
What about the egg?

18:31.140 --> 18:33.660
Um, there's other ways
we could create heat.

18:33.740 --> 18:35.410
Seriously, dude?

18:37.150 --> 18:38.200
Yeah.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.160
Come on, Gideon.

18:41.170 --> 18:43.750
There's gotta be a way
to boost the engines.

18:43.820 --> 18:46.580
Ray would know
how to read this.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.960
How much longer do we have
on life support?

18:50.040 --> 18:52.340
<i>Power reserves
are at 34 hours, Captain.</i>

18:52.350 --> 18:55.130
- Hey, you got a second?
- Not now, Rory.

18:55.210 --> 18:58.970
I actually came here
to apologize for, uh,

18:59.050 --> 19:00.680
blowing up before.

19:00.690 --> 19:04.430
Wow, that's... thank you.

19:04.440 --> 19:07.850
And I should have never...
And another thing!

19:09.940 --> 19:12.370
Give it up, Charlie.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.780
Why were you wearing my face?

19:18.790 --> 19:20.450
And were you about to apologize?

19:20.530 --> 19:22.660
Only because Charlie
was catfishing me.

19:22.740 --> 19:23.940
All right, shut up.

19:23.940 --> 19:25.660
Do you think Ray would be
fighting right now?

19:25.740 --> 19:27.880
No, he would be trying
to get us out of here.

19:30.470 --> 19:33.000
Yeah, you're right.
He's always got a plan.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.210
It's annoying.

19:34.220 --> 19:35.880
All right,
let's search Ray's quarters,

19:35.890 --> 19:37.800
see if we can find
something helpful.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.770
Thanks.

19:44.850 --> 19:45.970
Hmm.

19:47.890 --> 19:49.810
I tried talking to Ava,
and all she'd say was,

19:49.890 --> 19:51.980
"Gary Green
is all the man we need."

19:52.060 --> 19:53.740
Gary must be controlling
the Bureau somehow.

19:53.820 --> 19:55.480
It's those performance reviews.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.240
If we can find out
how he's doing it,

19:57.320 --> 19:59.490
maybe we can find a way
to snap them out of it.

19:59.560 --> 20:00.870
I can try tapping
into my powers,

20:00.950 --> 20:02.250
see if I can read him.

20:02.330 --> 20:04.080
If I can get to his office...
No!

20:04.090 --> 20:05.250
We're all we have left.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.910
We can't risk losing each other.

20:07.990 --> 20:09.330
I've got it.

20:09.410 --> 20:11.670
We'll tell Gary you found
some security issues

20:11.740 --> 20:13.080
in the containment cells.

20:13.100 --> 20:17.010
You walk him
over here like this.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.770
Then I'll close the cell doors
and you courier out,

20:19.840 --> 20:22.440
trapping him.
That's a great idea.

20:25.970 --> 20:28.480
Yeah, just like that.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.110
Okay, it works.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.480
You can let me out now.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.230
I'm sorry.
I can't do that right now.

20:36.310 --> 20:38.280
Sure, you can.
Just use the hand thing.

20:38.290 --> 20:41.070
No, Mona, you need a time-out.

20:41.150 --> 20:43.240
Gary Green
is all the man we need.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.620
No.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.460
Go and tell the others to
prepare the ritual for tonight.

20:50.470 --> 20:52.750
As you wish, my lord.

20:52.830 --> 20:55.790
You're wasting your time,
focusing on that monster.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.050
A Púca only reflects
the person it's with.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.340
It's only angry because
you scared the fur off it.

21:00.420 --> 21:03.130
That creature doesn't deserve
to go to hell.

21:03.150 --> 21:06.810
I see not why I should heed
the advice of a stranger.

21:06.820 --> 21:10.980
Then perhaps you will heed
the advice... of your kin.

21:17.020 --> 21:19.940
I know not of any kin
outside of this village.

21:20.020 --> 21:22.280
And yet the similarities
of your features...

21:22.360 --> 21:25.410
I'm a cousin from afar and a
practitioner of magic like you.

21:25.480 --> 21:28.240
If you want to rid your village
of a real monster,

21:28.320 --> 21:30.290
then I know of a demon
in our midst

21:30.360 --> 21:32.760
that we can banish together.

21:32.830 --> 21:34.670
A demon?

21:34.680 --> 21:36.130
In my village?

21:38.060 --> 21:40.180
Well, then lead the way, my kin.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.260
But this face stealer
with the other creature.

21:47.340 --> 21:48.510
Aye, my liege.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.140
Hell shall have two more guests

21:50.220 --> 21:51.780
by the end of the night.

21:55.030 --> 21:58.170
"Cards to Save the Timeline:

21:58.240 --> 22:02.050
a team-building card game
by Ray Palmer."

22:02.130 --> 22:06.380
Ah, I miss hating him.

22:06.390 --> 22:08.140
You remember that night
when we all met,

22:08.210 --> 22:10.390
standing up on that rooftop,
and Rip told us

22:10.460 --> 22:12.220
that we were gonna be legends?

22:12.230 --> 22:15.680
Mm-hmm, embarrassing.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.690
You know what?

22:17.760 --> 22:21.150
We're the last of the originals.

22:21.220 --> 22:22.150
Weird.

22:22.230 --> 22:24.080
Yeah, weird.

22:27.110 --> 22:28.750
Legends were different
back then.

22:28.820 --> 22:30.740
We were different back then.

22:32.610 --> 22:35.750
Look, I know
that book convention

22:35.760 --> 22:37.090
was important to you.

22:37.170 --> 22:40.170
And I'm really glad
that you got to go.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.840
I'm glad you have Ava.

22:41.910 --> 22:43.750
Thanks.

22:45.250 --> 22:48.010
Guess we're growing up...

22:48.090 --> 22:50.430
and hopefully not growing apart.

22:52.760 --> 22:55.020
Ah, here we are.

22:55.090 --> 22:56.480
What is it?

22:56.550 --> 22:58.770
"Ray Palmer's
Survival Guide."

22:58.780 --> 23:00.440
Let me see this.

23:00.510 --> 23:02.620
Oh, hey.

23:02.690 --> 23:05.780
"What to do if you're caught
in an avalanche."

23:05.860 --> 23:07.280
Uh-huh, what does it say?

23:07.290 --> 23:09.780
Yeah, we've already tried
all of these.

23:09.790 --> 23:12.870
"If all fails, remember
you still have each other,

23:12.940 --> 23:14.870
so enjoy that as long
as it lasts."

23:14.950 --> 23:16.800
Ah, we're dead.

23:16.870 --> 23:19.710
Yeah. Maybe.

23:25.790 --> 23:27.800
Hey, it's all right, little one.

23:27.810 --> 23:29.050
I don't bite.

23:29.130 --> 23:31.800
Ah!

23:31.810 --> 23:34.390
I see your talk went well.

23:35.820 --> 23:38.230
Knew you'd be here.

23:38.300 --> 23:42.230
Ah, so I come from
a long line of bloody bastards.

23:42.310 --> 23:44.270
Big reveal.

23:46.480 --> 23:49.240
Have you even considered
what it's really gonna be like

23:49.310 --> 23:52.780
for you in hell with all those
pissed-off folks you sent there

23:52.860 --> 23:55.950
just waiting for you?

23:56.030 --> 23:57.410
Including my Tabitha.

23:57.490 --> 23:59.160
Tabitha.

23:59.170 --> 24:01.000
Who is this bird, anyway?

24:01.010 --> 24:02.680
Why is she so important?

24:02.750 --> 24:05.420
- Who is she?
- Yeah.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.300
You're just like your ancestor.

24:07.370 --> 24:09.090
So convinced
you're always right.

24:09.170 --> 24:11.680
You don't even know
who you're sending away.

24:11.760 --> 24:14.890
Fitting that he's about
to do the same to you.

24:14.960 --> 24:18.230
But once you see
how powerful magic can be

24:18.310 --> 24:21.270
when fueled by fear,
you can save yourself

24:21.340 --> 24:23.020
from being sucked to hell.

24:26.220 --> 24:29.700
Oh, you would love for me
to stabilize that vortex,

24:29.780 --> 24:31.200
wouldn't you?

24:31.280 --> 24:32.710
You see, the thing is,

24:32.780 --> 24:35.040
I'm not afraid of going to hell.

24:35.120 --> 24:39.200
I've always counted on the fact
that I'd end up there one day

24:39.210 --> 24:41.370
no matter what.

24:41.380 --> 24:44.960
And what about this
innocent creature beside you?

24:50.390 --> 24:54.720
Well, I guess I'm just a
bloody bastard, then, aren't I?

25:02.740 --> 25:04.360
What's the bad news now?

25:04.440 --> 25:06.100
Oh, no bad news.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.980
And no more fighting.

25:08.060 --> 25:10.480
Gideon, fire up the ship.

25:10.560 --> 25:11.990
<i>If I do that,
life support capacity</i>

25:12.060 --> 25:13.530
<i>will be reduced by half.</i>

25:13.610 --> 25:14.910
You heard me, Gideon.

25:14.920 --> 25:18.030
Turn on the fabricators
and turn on the heat.

25:18.110 --> 25:23.160
I'm thinking s'mores,
maybe some hot cocoa.

25:23.240 --> 25:24.380
The captain's gone mad.

25:24.460 --> 25:27.210
She's not mad.
She's right.

25:27.290 --> 25:28.670
I could go for a s'more.

25:28.750 --> 25:30.350
Look, Ray would want us
to have faith

25:30.420 --> 25:31.710
that we will escape.

25:31.790 --> 25:33.770
He wouldn't want us
cold and miserable.

25:33.840 --> 25:37.730
So right now, we are going
to enjoy our time together.

25:37.810 --> 25:39.220
Let's go.

25:39.300 --> 25:41.940
Finally.
Let's get some music going.

25:45.110 --> 25:49.730
Who's gonna bring me food
if I'm stuck in here?

25:49.810 --> 25:52.360
This is how I'm gonna die,
isn't it?

25:52.440 --> 25:56.030
Without any books or laughter

25:56.110 --> 25:58.740
in the basement
of a government building?

25:58.820 --> 26:00.460
Whoa.

26:18.220 --> 26:21.980
You're right.
I'm not alone.

26:22.060 --> 26:23.980
I have you.

26:29.660 --> 26:32.860
I'm sorry you're stuck here
with me, little one.

26:32.870 --> 26:36.360
Ah, you should be out there
in the woods, frolicking about.

26:36.440 --> 26:40.280
Or whatever it is you Púcas
get up to these days.

26:41.670 --> 26:44.040
You know, to tell you the truth,

26:44.110 --> 26:46.660
I'm bloody well terrified.

26:46.670 --> 26:48.620
No.

26:48.700 --> 26:51.500
It's not the eternity of torture

26:51.510 --> 26:55.050
or the people
who are after my head, no.

26:55.120 --> 27:01.520
It's that I'll have to watch
Raymond and Astra

27:01.600 --> 27:05.400
and all the others I've failed
be tortured along with me.

27:06.640 --> 27:09.140
Even led the Legends
to their death.

27:11.390 --> 27:13.150
And you're next in line.

27:13.230 --> 27:15.150
Yeah, that's right.

27:15.230 --> 27:17.370
You sense the rottenness
inside me, don't you?

27:17.450 --> 27:20.320
No better than the bloody king.

27:29.870 --> 27:32.380
Why would you heal
a bastard like me?

27:37.040 --> 27:38.550
Up with you.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.010
Time to see the king.

27:41.380 --> 27:43.050
All right, then, little one.

27:43.060 --> 27:45.720
Let's go see what this party's
all about, shall we?

27:49.340 --> 27:54.110
We live in a world
of wonder and amazement.

27:54.180 --> 27:59.400
At times, it's beautiful,
breathtaking.

27:59.410 --> 28:03.530
At other times, cruel,
dangerous...

28:05.330 --> 28:07.410
And monstrous.

28:12.330 --> 28:16.600
Before you are two
foul creatures of the dark,

28:16.670 --> 28:19.380
one a grotesque
woodland creature

28:19.460 --> 28:21.380
that would not hesitate
to tear out your heart,

28:21.460 --> 28:24.340
the other an imposter,

28:24.420 --> 28:26.510
a wielder of the dark arts

28:26.590 --> 28:31.690
that would usurp
my very body and soul.

28:31.760 --> 28:35.860
Now, my people,
I seek your wisdom

28:35.930 --> 28:38.230
in these matters.

28:38.310 --> 28:42.780
What would you have me do
with such wretched beasts?

28:42.790 --> 28:45.030
To hell! To hell!

28:45.040 --> 28:48.740
To hell! To hell! To hell!

29:04.720 --> 29:06.060
We're very excited
for you to receive

29:06.070 --> 29:07.470
your performance review.

29:07.480 --> 29:11.490
But what actually happens
at the meeting?

29:11.560 --> 29:13.650
Feel free to give me
any spoilers.

29:14.990 --> 29:18.610
Don't worry.
I had my doubts too.

29:18.690 --> 29:21.000
But then I met with Gary
and realized

29:21.070 --> 29:23.160
Gary Green
is all the man we need.

29:23.170 --> 29:26.410
Gary Green
is all the man we need.

29:32.250 --> 29:33.460
Bye.

29:33.530 --> 29:36.920
Please step forward,
Ms. Wu.

29:39.350 --> 29:41.520
Take a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

29:45.690 --> 29:46.800
Mint?

29:46.880 --> 29:48.760
Eh, no, thanks.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.390
Don't mind if I do.

29:53.270 --> 29:55.940
Let's see.

29:56.020 --> 29:57.370
Mm.

29:57.440 --> 29:59.030
I see you've made
quite an impression

29:59.110 --> 30:01.530
in your brief time here.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.530
But lately you've been
slacking off.

30:06.030 --> 30:10.040
It says right here
you've been very disloyal

30:10.050 --> 30:12.160
to the Time Bureau.

30:12.170 --> 30:14.040
Not yet, Wolfie.

30:15.530 --> 30:17.460
Okay, I'll judge this round.

30:17.540 --> 30:19.460
You and your team are stuck
in a trash compactor

30:19.540 --> 30:22.390
in an impromptu and possibly
fatal homage to "Star Wars."

30:22.470 --> 30:23.620
What do you do?

30:23.620 --> 30:26.930
Boom, that's the one.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.860
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Yep.

30:28.930 --> 30:30.270
Ooh, gonna have to go with,

30:30.350 --> 30:32.180
"Steel up as Sara
scales a wall."

30:32.260 --> 30:34.690
- Another point for me.
- Favoritism!

30:34.760 --> 30:36.650
Why would I display favoritism?

30:36.720 --> 30:39.150
'Cause you two
are obviously shagging.

30:39.220 --> 30:40.690
- What?
- Hmm?

30:40.770 --> 30:42.400
Yeah.

30:42.410 --> 30:46.240
Yes, finally!
This is great.

30:46.250 --> 30:47.740
Maybe you guys
won't be so weird now.

30:47.750 --> 30:50.410
Okay, I'll judge next.

30:50.420 --> 30:54.620
A teammate turns on you,
lost to the dark side.

30:54.700 --> 30:55.830
What do you do?

30:57.910 --> 31:00.040
Mm.

31:03.250 --> 31:05.260
"Escape via musical number."

31:05.270 --> 31:06.550
Not this time.

31:06.630 --> 31:09.720
"Fabricate eveningwear
and infiltrate a party."

31:09.800 --> 31:12.010
You guys know I love
a good party sneak.

31:12.090 --> 31:14.600
"Don't give up on each other.
Work together.

31:14.610 --> 31:17.190
You're more than a team.
You are a family."

31:21.810 --> 31:23.190
Well, I guess that card's
the winner, then.

31:23.270 --> 31:25.190
Point to Charlie.
I'm on the board.

31:28.110 --> 31:29.950
- The hell was that?
<i>- Due to your reckless use</i>

31:29.960 --> 31:31.500
<i>of our rapidly depleting energy,</i>

31:31.580 --> 31:33.290
<i>internal temperature
of the ship has melted</i>

31:33.290 --> 31:35.800
<i>the surrounding ice enough
to shake the ship loose.</i>

31:35.870 --> 31:36.960
What do we do?

31:37.030 --> 31:38.420
We work as a team.

31:38.490 --> 31:40.790
Zari, engine room.
Get the thrusters back online.

31:40.870 --> 31:42.920
Seal the cargo bay.
You two with me.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.650
My dear people!

31:50.720 --> 31:53.970
I hear your cries
and feel your anger.

31:53.980 --> 31:56.480
And therefore, by your command,

31:56.490 --> 31:58.770
I send these creatures

31:58.850 --> 32:00.230
where they belong.

32:00.310 --> 32:01.270
Straight to hell!

32:01.350 --> 32:03.900
Straight to hell!
Straight to hell!

32:03.980 --> 32:06.490
Straight to hell!
Straight to hell!

32:20.590 --> 32:24.840
Begone, you unclean beasts!

32:33.170 --> 32:36.690
Come on, Johnny.
You know what you need to do.

32:36.770 --> 32:40.060
Oh, bollocks.

32:53.900 --> 32:58.160
Here. Run, run.

33:00.720 --> 33:02.880
What have you done?

33:02.950 --> 33:05.140
I've used your own magic
against you.

33:13.250 --> 33:16.430
We may be kin,
but we are not the same.

33:22.010 --> 33:25.360
Now, you may not agree
with my methods,

33:25.430 --> 33:28.870
but I will always
protect my people.

33:47.760 --> 33:50.140
Now, the question is,
Ms. Wu,

33:50.220 --> 33:53.550
what shall we do
about your disloyalty?

33:53.630 --> 33:56.510
Uh, maybe...

33:56.590 --> 33:59.560
I lose my snack room
privileges for a week.

33:59.630 --> 34:01.730
Oh, no!
Not my almonds!

34:01.800 --> 34:05.100
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about your almonds.

34:05.110 --> 34:07.270
Because as I'm sure
you've heard,

34:07.280 --> 34:10.360
Gary Green
is all the man you need.

34:10.440 --> 34:14.199
Now, gaze into the nipple.

34:19.610 --> 34:22.040
Wolfie!
Now!

34:22.110 --> 34:23.630
What's a Wolfie?

34:28.550 --> 34:30.460
W-W-W-Wolfie?

34:37.090 --> 34:38.300
Bravo.

34:38.370 --> 34:40.760
I knew you could exploit fear
to make yourself

34:40.840 --> 34:42.139
even more powerful.

34:42.150 --> 34:43.770
Well, it looks like
you taught this old dog

34:43.840 --> 34:45.650
some new tricks after all.

34:45.730 --> 34:48.940
But now I'm gonna use those
new tricks to strike you down.

34:49.020 --> 34:52.070
You know, I do have
a few tricks of my own.

34:57.650 --> 34:59.740
<i>We're running on very low
reserve power.</i>

34:59.820 --> 35:01.660
<i>The odds of us successfully
pushing through the avalanche</i>

35:01.670 --> 35:04.080
<i>above us are 3,720 to 1.</i>

35:04.160 --> 35:05.910
Never tell me the odds, Gideon.

35:05.990 --> 35:07.580
Everyone hold on tight.

35:07.660 --> 35:09.130
Oh, this better work.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.290
It will.

35:13.020 --> 35:14.890
- You got Wicksty?
- Yeah, I'm not letting go.

35:20.210 --> 35:22.430
Come on, come on.

35:26.550 --> 35:28.150
- Boom!
- Whoo!

35:28.160 --> 35:29.510
Yes!

35:29.590 --> 35:31.020
<i>All systems are back online,
Captain.</i>

35:31.030 --> 35:32.320
Fantastic, Gideon.

35:32.390 --> 35:35.330
Now let's go find
Constantine and Ray.

35:43.570 --> 35:45.720
Oh, damn executive
privacy button.

35:45.790 --> 35:47.550
Uh, hey.

35:47.630 --> 35:49.840
Can you do me a solid and press
that button over there,

35:49.910 --> 35:50.960
if you...

35:52.620 --> 35:55.050
Do you really think I'm letting
you get out of here alive?

35:57.540 --> 35:58.470
Help!

36:00.430 --> 36:02.260
Get away from him, you beast!

36:14.770 --> 36:15.820
What happened?

36:15.900 --> 36:17.910
I don't know.

36:17.990 --> 36:22.030
But I'm guessing he had
something to do with it.

36:47.430 --> 36:50.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:50.100 --> 36:52.110
It may be too late to save Ray

36:52.120 --> 36:55.070
or Desmond or the Legends.

36:55.140 --> 36:57.790
But at least I'll get to send
you back where you belong.

37:04.500 --> 37:06.580
Oh, you bastards.
You did it.

37:06.660 --> 37:07.960
You bloody survived.

37:07.970 --> 37:10.970
I've never been so happy
to be wrong in my life.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.840
Don't do it, John.
Don't kill him.

37:12.910 --> 37:15.100
Don't give up on Haircut.

37:15.170 --> 37:17.140
What are you gonna do, Johnny?

37:17.220 --> 37:18.640
You're all out of moves.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.060
No, I'm not.

37:29.560 --> 37:32.060
I'll see you lovely lot
at the end.

37:32.140 --> 37:33.810
I'm gonna save Ray.

37:39.150 --> 37:40.400
John!

38:07.350 --> 38:08.430
The magic-o-meter's picking up

38:08.510 --> 38:09.930
strange activity on the ground.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.270
Tabitha, show yourself.

38:20.350 --> 38:21.490
Ah.

38:21.560 --> 38:24.370
So wonderful to be back.

38:24.450 --> 38:27.200
Brimstone was so awful
for my complexion.

38:27.210 --> 38:29.240
Oh, but you look ravishing,
my love.

38:31.700 --> 38:34.120
Hold on.
Is he kissing...

38:34.200 --> 38:36.130
Oh, the Fairy Godmother.

38:36.200 --> 38:37.890
Is that tongue?

38:37.960 --> 38:39.840
More singing.

38:39.920 --> 38:41.720
We're so screwed.

38:44.380 --> 38:46.180
Come with me, my pet.

38:46.260 --> 38:48.180
Let's find you a new host.

38:49.380 --> 38:51.140
It's his nipple.

38:52.810 --> 38:55.650
He tried to hypnotize Mona
with his nipple.

38:57.770 --> 39:00.150
His nipple?

39:00.230 --> 39:03.070
Neron gave you back your nipple
which became bad in hell,

39:03.150 --> 39:05.530
which is now poisoning
your mind and making you evil,

39:05.610 --> 39:07.490
and that's why you came back
to the Time Bureau...

39:07.570 --> 39:09.490
So that you could
nip-notize everyone

39:09.570 --> 39:12.250
and Neron could take over.
Yeah.

39:12.260 --> 39:15.260
You will do no more harm
with your nipple!

39:17.180 --> 39:19.840
No, no, no, no!

39:19.910 --> 39:21.340
No, no, please no!

39:29.140 --> 39:30.810
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

39:30.820 --> 39:32.400
It wasn't me.
It was my nipple.

39:32.480 --> 39:33.430
I swear.

39:37.100 --> 39:38.990
Save me!

39:39.070 --> 39:40.520
As you wish.

39:48.460 --> 39:50.130
You have to go.

39:50.200 --> 39:51.750
Tell the Legends
what's going on.

39:51.750 --> 39:54.130
- Wait, what about you?
- I'm not leaving Mona behind.

39:54.210 --> 39:55.620
Always knew you were
a team player.

40:00.140 --> 40:01.920
Ava.
You okay?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.050
It's a long story,
but Gary took over the Bureau.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.470
He nip-notized everyone.

40:05.480 --> 40:07.010
Yeah, you're gonna have
to explain that.

40:07.020 --> 40:08.720
The germ turned.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.720
Well, it's not just him.
It's Neron and...

40:10.800 --> 40:12.480
The Fairy Godmother, Tabitha.

40:12.560 --> 40:13.650
She's Tabitha?

40:13.730 --> 40:15.390
Yeah, you missed a lot.

40:15.400 --> 40:16.810
And Ray is still in hell.

40:16.820 --> 40:17.990
I know he hasn't given up,

40:18.060 --> 40:19.650
so we're not gonna
give up on him.

40:19.660 --> 40:21.450
Now, let's do this...

40:21.530 --> 40:23.200
for Ray.

40:57.530 --> 40:59.270
Bloody hell.
