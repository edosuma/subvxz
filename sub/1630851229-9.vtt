06:44.963 --> 06:46.554
Ow! Right there.

06:46.556 --> 06:47.964
Can you describe
your pain for me?

06:47.966 --> 06:49.482
Throbbing.

06:49.484 --> 06:51.392
Or maybe stabbing.

06:51.394 --> 06:53.227
Are you having any nausea
or vomiting?

06:53.229 --> 06:54.654
I thought I was
just nervous at first,

06:54.656 --> 06:57.732
you know, existential angst,
which I am prone to,

06:57.734 --> 07:00.160
and it is kind of
my occupational wheelhouse.

and vomiting?

07:07.594 --> 07:11.004
Oh, right, yes.

07:11.006 --> 07:13.323
Just keeps on coming up.

07:13.325 --> 07:14.916
We'll start with a CT scan
to take a closer look,

07:14.918 --> 07:17.251
and we can admit you
to get control over your pain

07:17.253 --> 07:18.437
and we'll go from there.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.497

07:20.499 --> 07:22.065
DEVON:
All right, we'll be back.

07:27.263 --> 07:28.930
It's a large hepatic hemangioma.

07:28.932 --> 07:30.264
That's a good catch, Dr. Devi.

07:30.266 --> 07:32.266
LEELA:
I haven't seen one
of these before.

07:32.268 --> 07:33.601
Well, they're more common
than you'd think.

07:33.603 --> 07:35.361
They're benign tumors
made up of clusters

07:35.363 --> 07:36.529
of blood-filled cavities.

07:36.531 --> 07:38.290
And usually
they don't cause symptoms.

07:38.292 --> 07:41.126
Well, I'm relieved it's benign.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.020
My patient will be, too.
She's a little kooky.

07:44.022 --> 07:46.298
Sweet, though.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.208
Should I book an OR for us
this afternoon?

07:48.210 --> 07:50.635
Oh, not so fast.
Surgery's not a slam dunk here.

07:51.788 --> 07:53.363
A benign tumor causing pain?

07:53.365 --> 07:55.456
Well, surgery on the liver
is always high-risk,

07:55.458 --> 07:57.458
even in the best hands,
and pain can be managed.

07:57.460 --> 07:59.552
Okay, so I tell her
we're not operating,

07:59.554 --> 08:02.222
and I need a repeat scan
in two months.

08:02.224 --> 08:03.707
And that's not
the answer, either.

08:03.709 --> 08:06.392
This is not something
we can decide here.

08:06.394 --> 08:07.635
You need to talk
to your patient

08:07.637 --> 08:09.212
and get a sense
of her risk tolerance

08:09.214 --> 08:10.471
and the seriousness
of her symptoms,

08:10.473 --> 08:13.992
and then you tell me
what path you think makes sense.

08:16.054 --> 08:17.570
All right. Can you come with?

08:17.572 --> 08:19.498
Nope. She's your patient,
you handle it.

08:19.500 --> 08:24.894
Then meet me in OR 3--
an, uh, emergent splenectomy.

08:24.896 --> 08:26.046
Uh, 15 minutes.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.082
<i> LEELA:</i>
<i> So, you have two options.</i>

08:29.084 --> 08:30.324
If you go with the surgery
and it goes well,

08:30.326 --> 08:32.677
-your symptoms go away.
-Awesome.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.738
But surgery on the liver
is never an easy call to make.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.681
It's an organ
with many large blood vessels,

08:36.683 --> 08:39.000
which means we could run
into significant bleeding.

08:39.002 --> 08:40.227
Oh. Not awesome.

08:40.229 --> 08:41.669
And that circumstance
would require

08:41.671 --> 08:43.855
a much larger abdominal surgery
with complications

08:43.857 --> 08:45.732
and a long recovery.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.434
Are you with me?

08:48.436 --> 08:49.677
Uh, sort of.

08:49.679 --> 08:52.756
Uh, you understand, right?
I'm not a doctor.

08:52.758 --> 08:54.348
I'm a cartoonist.

08:54.350 --> 08:55.867
Right.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.036
Um...

08:59.097 --> 09:00.263
Do you take risks?

09:00.265 --> 09:02.599
If you do,
then we go with the surgery.

09:02.601 --> 09:05.359
Are you cautious?
Then we hold off for now,

09:05.361 --> 09:07.212
so long as your pain
is tolerable.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.196

09:10.625 --> 09:12.884
Okay, you know what? Look.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.202
It's okay. Big decision.

09:15.204 --> 09:17.055
Think about it,
and I will check in

09:17.057 --> 09:18.798

from surgery, okay?

09:18.800 --> 09:20.433
Okay.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.565
Heart block. What is that?

09:26.567 --> 09:28.491
Because of the sarcoid,
your heart's electric circuit

09:28.493 --> 09:30.460
isn't working correctly,
so your heartbeat

09:30.462 --> 09:33.129
slows to a dangerously low rate.

09:33.131 --> 09:34.480
In some cases,
it can stop completely.

09:34.482 --> 09:36.633
Which, to state the obvious,
is fatal.

09:36.635 --> 09:39.226
This morning,
your heartbeat slowed so much

09:39.228 --> 09:41.321
that you fainted
and you crashed your bike.

09:41.323 --> 09:43.081
AUSTIN:
But there is some good news.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.324
Told you guys.

09:44.326 --> 09:46.976
The solution to your problem

09:46.978 --> 09:48.086
is safe and simple.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.495
We put in a pacemaker,

09:49.497 --> 09:51.497
and your heart goes back
to beating normally again.

09:51.499 --> 09:53.258
So you're saying
I need a surgery?

09:53.260 --> 09:55.076
Yeah, and it's just
an outpatient procedure.

09:55.078 --> 09:56.986
No general anesthesia,
no operating room.

09:56.988 --> 09:58.763
It's super simple.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.098
TREVOR:
Another narrow escape
from death.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.659
The Wyatt Barnes legend grows.

10:02.661 --> 10:04.585
-Hey.
-(laughter)

10:04.587 --> 10:06.846
I'd like to admit you
for observation, and then

10:06.848 --> 10:09.107
we'll schedule the procedure
as soon as possible.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.358
Oh, I don't want the pacemaker.

10:11.519 --> 10:13.612
A-Admit me, fine,
but, you know, finish

10:13.614 --> 10:16.263
fixing me up and...
(tongue clicks) send me home.

10:16.265 --> 10:17.340
No, you don't understand.

10:17.342 --> 10:18.766
If we don't put
the pacemaker in,

10:18.768 --> 10:20.693
you will almost certainly die.

10:20.695 --> 10:21.578
Almost?

10:22.864 --> 10:25.106
I'll take those odds.

10:25.108 --> 10:26.532
AUSTIN:
We are doctors,

10:26.534 --> 10:29.519
advising you on a procedure
that will save your life.

10:29.521 --> 10:33.948
Sorry, but it's my body,
my decision.

10:33.950 --> 10:36.051
No pacemaker.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.511
No, thanks.

10:44.552 --> 10:47.461
-Hey, we need a cart over here!
-Now that you're spending

10:47.463 --> 10:48.388
more time on research
and clinical trials,

10:48.390 --> 10:49.630
we need a new ER doctor.

10:49.632 --> 10:51.391
And I'd like you to do
the interviews today.

10:51.393 --> 10:53.151
I would, of course,
but I'm only filling in

10:53.153 --> 10:54.486
for a few hours today.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.562
And I didn't set aside time
for that.

10:56.564 --> 10:58.731
There must be someone else
who can help.

10:58.733 --> 11:00.307
There's no one.
And I worked here all night.

11:00.309 --> 11:03.477
I'm sorry.
Here are the candidates.

11:03.479 --> 11:06.331
Dr. Voss, I have to get my
grant proposal in by 6:00 p.m.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.482
Your proposal will have to wait.

11:08.484 --> 11:09.726
And I don't need
to remind you why

11:09.728 --> 11:11.378
we're short-staffed in the ER.

11:13.156 --> 11:14.488
Yeah. I get it.

11:14.490 --> 11:16.065
-(pager beeping)
-Thank you.

11:16.067 --> 11:18.343
I'm counting on you.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.994
Happy to help.

11:19.996 --> 11:22.055
(phone chiming and buzzing)

11:33.009 --> 11:35.068
♪

11:42.202 --> 11:45.111
So, our Mr. Lucky
has complete AV block

11:45.113 --> 11:47.188
with wide ventricular escape.

11:47.190 --> 11:48.765
He's not gonna live
long enough to cash in

11:48.767 --> 11:50.542
his third lotto ticket
without a pacemaker.

11:50.544 --> 11:51.525
(sighs)

11:51.545 --> 11:53.861
I mean, you think
he wants to die?

11:53.863 --> 11:55.196
(phone ringing)

11:55.198 --> 11:59.050
Yeah, the guy's super cheerful.
It's bizarre.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.469
Mom, listen,
I'm in the middle of...

12:03.372 --> 12:05.223
Well, is-is the cough
getting any better?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.559
Did you call the oncologist?

12:07.561 --> 12:11.045
Mom, just do it now, please.

12:11.047 --> 12:13.565
Yes, I will see you
before I go to the airport.

12:15.810 --> 12:17.794
Tell Carol I'll call her,

12:17.796 --> 12:21.740
talk her through some options
for her respiratory symptoms.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.158
Appreciate it, man.

12:24.319 --> 12:26.560
Look, I-I wish I could engage.

12:26.562 --> 12:29.155
All right? I-If there were
28 hours in the day,

12:29.157 --> 12:31.065
I would gladly wax poetic
with the patient

12:31.067 --> 12:32.658
about the benefits
of a pacemaker,

12:32.660 --> 12:34.494
but I do not have the time.

12:34.496 --> 12:37.997
I have way too many patients
who would kill for an easy cure.

12:37.999 --> 12:40.650
I got too many,
too many obligations.

12:40.652 --> 12:42.243
All right, you get him
to see reason,

12:42.245 --> 12:43.595
I have no doubt that you will,

12:43.597 --> 12:46.598
then I will come back,
I'll put in the pacer.

12:49.418 --> 12:50.769
(exhales)

12:50.771 --> 12:52.920
Okay. Have you, uh...

12:52.922 --> 12:54.180
you seen this problem before?

12:54.182 --> 12:57.442
All the time
during the pandemic.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.594
We had a lot of patients who
died claiming COVID was made up.

13:00.596 --> 13:02.614
Well, what do we do next?

13:02.616 --> 13:05.766
He agreed to a brief admission,
so we bring him up to the ICU,

13:05.768 --> 13:09.028
start him on isoproterenol
to raise his heart rate

13:09.030 --> 13:10.179
while I figure out
a way to respectfully

13:10.181 --> 13:11.122
get him to see reason.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.625
I will watch and learn.

13:15.020 --> 13:16.869
Hey, Brit,
have you had some time

13:16.871 --> 13:18.630
to review your options?

13:21.693 --> 13:24.385
She was here a minute ago.
She should be back soon.

13:33.371 --> 13:37.707
And if you had to change one
thing about emergency medicine,

13:37.709 --> 13:38.799
what would it be?

13:38.893 --> 13:40.151
Well, we're letting money
walk out the door.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.561
That's for sure.

13:41.563 --> 13:44.305
Uh, I personally would deploy
a-a number of strategies

13:44.307 --> 13:46.341
that would be more lucrative
for the hospital.

13:46.343 --> 13:47.492
Uh, I mean, you can't fix

13:47.494 --> 13:49.494
all the inefficiencies at once,
you know?

13:49.496 --> 13:53.164
You got to let this, uh,
this pig work its way through

13:53.166 --> 13:55.725
the-the boa constrictor,
so to speak.

13:55.727 --> 13:58.394
So, I created some slides here,
uh, with ideas

13:58.396 --> 14:00.154
for how to capitalize
on low-hanging fruit.

14:00.156 --> 14:02.489
I'll talk you through it.

14:02.491 --> 14:04.676
Uh, shouldn't be more than,
uh, an hour.

14:05.753 --> 14:07.011
Or two.

14:09.757 --> 14:11.741
Brit?

14:11.743 --> 14:14.519
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

14:15.597 --> 14:17.856
Has your abdominal pain
gotten worse?

14:17.858 --> 14:20.859
You shouldn't be out here.
We should get you back inside.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.527
It's not that, Dr. Devi.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.530
I had to get some air
so I could think.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.698
Okay.

14:29.185 --> 14:31.202
I can't decide
about the surgery.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.779
I tell myself, "Go for it."

14:33.781 --> 14:36.690
Then I think
it's too dangerous.

14:36.692 --> 14:40.603
What if I bleed to death
in the OR and my cat dies alone?

14:40.605 --> 14:43.715
Or I go home and die and no one
finds me and Tinkerbell eats me.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.292
-You have to take it easy, Brit.
-Sometimes I wake up

14:46.294 --> 14:48.444
and she's staring at me
like I'm a goldfish.

14:48.446 --> 14:49.946
There's a darkness in her.

14:49.948 --> 14:52.465
I'm indecisive.

14:52.467 --> 14:55.059
Even about things
that don't matter.

14:55.061 --> 14:58.062
My cartoons poke fun
at people like me.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.024
Brit.

15:02.794 --> 15:05.695
What can I do to help you
make this decision?

15:07.482 --> 15:09.073
Make it for me?

15:10.059 --> 15:11.910
Just be my doctor.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.661
I'll do whatever you say.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.291
(monitor beeping steadily)

15:20.995 --> 15:23.737
How am I doing?

15:23.739 --> 15:26.591
CONRAD:
Your heart rate
is dangerously slow.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.484
38.

15:28.486 --> 15:31.095
Meds helped transiently,
but they can't fix this,

15:31.097 --> 15:32.430
and it's getting worse.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.839
I feel fine.

15:33.841 --> 15:35.249
That's impossible, okay?

15:35.251 --> 15:36.935
You have to be tired,
light-headed...

15:36.937 --> 15:38.061
Not really.

15:39.088 --> 15:40.254
I'm hungry.

15:40.256 --> 15:42.106
This place have ice cream?

15:43.259 --> 15:45.501
Yes...
(chuckles)

15:45.503 --> 15:48.095
...but let's finish
talking first.

15:48.097 --> 15:50.173
A pacemaker is a simple device.

15:50.175 --> 15:52.508
It is not dangerous to put in,

15:52.510 --> 15:54.118
and it will keep you
from falling off your bike

15:54.120 --> 15:55.511
in the middle of traffic.

15:55.513 --> 15:57.121
Or dying today.

15:57.123 --> 16:00.458
Which could happen.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.276
It's not gonna happen.

16:02.278 --> 16:04.520
-What are you afraid of, Wyatt?
-(scoffs)

16:04.522 --> 16:06.689
I'm not afraid.
I just don't like the idea

16:06.691 --> 16:08.466
of having a foreign object
put into my body.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.876
Do you know anyone
with type 1 diabetes?

16:10.878 --> 16:12.303
Yeah. My old boss.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.305
Did your boss use
an insulin pump?

16:14.307 --> 16:16.641
She does, but what
you're talking about

16:16.643 --> 16:18.718
is putting something in
to control my heart.

16:18.720 --> 16:19.960
That's different.

16:19.962 --> 16:21.462
No. Not really.

16:21.464 --> 16:22.814
Uh, complications
from pacemakers are rare.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.707
WYATT:
I'm sorry, but I do
my own research.

16:24.709 --> 16:27.376
I'm part of this Facebook group.

16:27.378 --> 16:28.969
-Oh, here we go.
-And they just published a list

16:28.971 --> 16:30.822
of unsafe products from China.

16:30.824 --> 16:33.899
Know what's on top? Pacemakers.

16:33.901 --> 16:35.401
Now, they're assembled here,

16:35.403 --> 16:37.478
but guess where the parts
come from.

16:37.480 --> 16:41.073
Yep. Guy in the group
got poisoned by some bad metals.

16:41.075 --> 16:43.726
Those posts aren't truthful,
Wyatt.

16:43.728 --> 16:47.563
They are propaganda
from unqualified people

16:47.565 --> 16:49.232
who have politicized health
and medicine.

16:49.234 --> 16:51.175
They either want to sow distrust
in science

16:51.177 --> 16:52.326
or sell you snake oil.

16:52.328 --> 16:53.827
TREVOR:
The real truth, Wyatt?

16:53.829 --> 16:55.496
Bad metal is not a thing.

16:55.498 --> 16:57.240
Dr. Hawkins is who you want
giving you advice.

16:57.242 --> 16:58.924
He's an actual expert.

16:58.926 --> 17:00.426
I form my own opinions, okay?

17:00.428 --> 17:03.429
-You have yours.
-Okay, this isn't an opinion.

17:03.431 --> 17:05.097
It's fact versus fiction.

17:05.099 --> 17:06.566
-Do you understand?
-CONRAD: All right.

17:07.769 --> 17:09.527
We hear you, Wyatt.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.154
Okay?

17:14.092 --> 17:15.758
Be back to check on you
in a bit.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.326
Thanks, Doc.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.763
He was getting
more and more dug in.

17:20.932 --> 17:22.265
-You have to know
how to take a step back.
-Okay, but if Wyatt dies,

17:22.267 --> 17:23.491
it won't be sarcoid
that kills him,

17:23.493 --> 17:26.602
it'll be i-irrational fear
and misinformation.

17:26.604 --> 17:29.196
And those are difficult
conditions to cure.

17:29.198 --> 17:30.882
-I...
-Some people only
accept information

17:30.884 --> 17:32.366
that confirms their beliefs.

17:32.368 --> 17:34.293
You have to give them the facts,

17:34.295 --> 17:35.887
tell them how important
the science is,

17:35.889 --> 17:38.781
-but then if you push
too hard...
-I get that, but if...

17:38.783 --> 17:42.134
...we lose what little trust
we may have earned.

17:42.136 --> 17:44.562
Even when you're 1,000% right.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.473
-Uh-- He's gonna...
-Gentlemen.

17:47.475 --> 17:50.401
So I don't see your patient
on my cath lab schedule.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.904
-What happened? No pacemaker?
-Uh, not yet.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.055
We were just getting ready
to discuss next steps.

17:55.057 --> 17:57.133
The guy actually
believes in luck.

17:57.135 --> 17:58.559
As in, he's too lucky to die.

17:58.561 --> 18:01.245
He did tell us
he's always felt protected

18:01.247 --> 18:03.414
in an "otherworldly" way.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.566
An argument could be made that
he doesn't have the capacity

18:05.568 --> 18:08.068
to make medical decisions
for himself.

18:08.070 --> 18:09.312
Well, if he's making
his decision based on

18:09.314 --> 18:11.330
otherworldly information,
you may be right.

18:11.332 --> 18:13.482
I'll call Dr. Malco
in the psych department.

18:13.484 --> 18:16.469
Let's hope this works.
Wyatt's running out of time.

18:26.164 --> 18:28.589
Wyatt, why don't you tell me
in your own words

18:28.591 --> 18:30.108
what's going on
with your health right now?

18:30.110 --> 18:31.834
It's pretty simple.

18:31.836 --> 18:34.112
I've never liked hospitals,

18:34.114 --> 18:36.597
but I came here
because of a bike accident.

18:36.599 --> 18:39.266
They escalated the whole thing
by threatening

18:39.268 --> 18:41.193
to put in a pacemaker.

18:41.195 --> 18:43.679
Do you know how many people
get a pacemaker?

18:43.681 --> 18:46.290
They're slapping them
into everybody these days.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.275
Why don't you trust
your doctors?

18:48.277 --> 18:50.294
I make up my own mind.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.355
And, look, I'm not crazy.

18:52.357 --> 18:54.132
You know, agreeing to have
doctors I just met

18:54.134 --> 18:57.618
implant something into my body
is what's crazy.

18:57.620 --> 19:00.805
We just need to make sure that
you understand the consequences

19:00.807 --> 19:03.199
of the decision
you're making here.

19:03.201 --> 19:05.626
I've been listening
to those two all day.

19:05.628 --> 19:07.294
Of course I understand.

19:07.296 --> 19:11.131
And there's something you need
to understand about me.

19:11.133 --> 19:13.058
And what is that?

19:13.060 --> 19:15.211
You're not gonna change my mind.

19:15.213 --> 19:17.713
And if I do die,
I don't want anyone

19:17.715 --> 19:21.325
going wild and
pounding on my chest, okay?

19:21.327 --> 19:24.328
Write that down
in your little notepad.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.581
We all have to die someday.

19:28.059 --> 19:30.126
And I am not going out
like that.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.249
-Dr. Bell?
-Yeah.

19:37.251 --> 19:40.011
-Do you have a second?
-Mm-hmm.

19:40.013 --> 19:42.096
(exhales)

19:43.016 --> 19:44.740
Please tell me this gets easier.

19:44.742 --> 19:46.575
Is this about making
a life-or-death decision

19:46.577 --> 19:49.187
-for a person you just met?
-Yes.

19:50.415 --> 19:53.098
It should never be easy.
This is the job.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.266
It's not irrational
for a patient to think

19:54.268 --> 19:56.677
we know more
and should decide for them.

19:56.679 --> 19:58.254
What if I can't figure out
what's the best way to go?

19:58.256 --> 20:00.448
You will, because you have to.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.275
That's what your patient needs.

20:03.277 --> 20:05.352
So go with your gut, Dr. Devi,

20:05.354 --> 20:08.855
informed by your experience
and your schooling.

20:08.857 --> 20:12.043
-Okay?
-Okay.

20:16.958 --> 20:18.216
<i> PADMA:</i>
<i> Dr. Voss.</i>

20:18.218 --> 20:20.200
Tell me what you need.
I'm here to help.

20:20.202 --> 20:23.279
Well, I'm realizing
that all our doctors

20:23.281 --> 20:25.389
are in danger of burnout.

20:25.391 --> 20:28.709
The stress at times
can be unrelenting.

20:28.711 --> 20:31.395
Maybe your program can help.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.972
I would love that.

20:32.974 --> 20:35.399
I offer yoga sessions,
meditation,

20:35.401 --> 20:37.401
sleep counseling
and positive affirmations.

20:37.403 --> 20:42.356
Plus, fresh-baked
resiliency cookies. Gluten-free.

20:42.358 --> 20:47.303
I think I could make everybody
ten percent happier, at least.

20:47.305 --> 20:50.063
I would invest
in ten percent happier.

20:50.065 --> 20:51.231
When can you start?

20:51.233 --> 20:53.066
Shall we start now?

20:53.068 --> 20:55.753
(laughs):
Yes. Sign me up.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.237
-Come sit down.
-Oh.

20:57.239 --> 21:00.132
Just five minutes.

21:02.653 --> 21:05.321
-Lie down, put your feet up.
-Oh, wait, I can't. I'd be...

21:05.323 --> 21:07.932
(laughing):
All right. Okay.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.934
(clears throat)

21:09.936 --> 21:11.352
Close your eyes.

21:12.663 --> 21:17.758
And now just take
a deep, cleansing breath.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.018
(pager beeping)

21:19.020 --> 21:20.528
Ooh, sorry.

21:23.024 --> 21:24.490
-Later. I promise.
-Okay.

21:26.027 --> 21:27.676
(laughs softly)

21:27.678 --> 21:29.537
♪

21:31.774 --> 21:33.624
(speaking Spanish)

21:37.522 --> 21:39.538
-Do you speak Spanish?
-(chuckles) No.

21:39.540 --> 21:41.707
I don't think there's room
in my head

21:41.709 --> 21:44.451
for any more words
I'm supposed to understand.

21:44.453 --> 21:47.863
Do you mind turning it down?
I promise to keep this simple.

21:47.865 --> 21:50.549
(TV turns off)

21:50.551 --> 21:53.552
Based on the size of your
hemangioma and your symptoms,

21:53.554 --> 21:56.647
if it were me,
I would go with the surgery.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.298
(exhales)

21:58.300 --> 22:00.893
Surgery it is. When?

22:00.895 --> 22:02.320
Well, we can operate
later today.

22:02.322 --> 22:05.031
But I would like to take you
through the consent.

22:07.718 --> 22:09.476
There are risks.

22:09.478 --> 22:13.556
Bleeding, infection,
damage to your liver.

22:13.558 --> 22:15.666
It's possible but unlikely
that we'll have trouble

22:15.668 --> 22:17.743
getting you off the ventilator.

22:17.745 --> 22:20.229
And as with any surgery,
there is a risk of death.

22:20.231 --> 22:22.340
Have you done
this operation often?

22:22.342 --> 22:25.084
Uh, no, I haven't,
but the senior surgeon

22:25.086 --> 22:27.828
I work with has,
and he'll be there.

22:27.830 --> 22:29.830
(exhales)

22:29.832 --> 22:31.423
Pen.

22:31.425 --> 22:33.517
All right.

22:35.003 --> 22:36.729
BRIT:
Thank you.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.983
(pen scratching)

22:48.851 --> 22:50.259
He's clear and consistent.

22:50.261 --> 22:51.685
I don't find him
to be influenced

22:51.687 --> 22:54.613
by untreated depression,
and he's not suicidal.

22:54.615 --> 22:56.523
His choice isn't one
that I would make for myself

22:56.525 --> 22:59.768
or someone I love, but it's one
he has a right to make.

22:59.770 --> 23:02.863
What do you make of his belief
that he's cosmically protected?

23:02.865 --> 23:05.290
Hearing celestial voices
is one thing,

23:05.292 --> 23:08.034
but it's human nature to search

23:08.036 --> 23:10.279
for explanations
for our experiences.

23:10.281 --> 23:12.223
Just describing them
in ways that are fantastical

23:12.225 --> 23:14.633
doesn't signify
a lack of capacity.

23:14.635 --> 23:16.468
Um, I'm sorry,
it makes no sense.

23:16.470 --> 23:20.289
I mean, look how young he is,
and he even requested a DNR?

23:20.291 --> 23:24.217
Which is a sign that
he's-he's clear and coherent.

23:24.219 --> 23:25.719
Look, lack of capacity
is a high bar,

23:25.721 --> 23:27.721
and Wyatt doesn't reach it.

23:27.723 --> 23:29.465
I'm sorry.

23:29.467 --> 23:32.493
-You have to respect his wishes.
-All right, thank you, Leslie.

23:35.973 --> 23:37.415
Uh...

23:37.417 --> 23:39.399
Is that really it?

23:39.401 --> 23:40.325
If he's determined
to have capacity,

23:40.327 --> 23:41.660
we can't force him
to be treated.

23:41.662 --> 23:43.421
Wait, hold on, I thought
you were the renegade.

23:43.423 --> 23:44.997
I heard you drilled
into a guy's head

23:44.999 --> 23:46.498
and you're not even a surgeon.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.575
But you're gonna sit here
and let this man die?

23:48.577 --> 23:50.261
If the guy would've said,
"Whatever you do,

23:50.263 --> 23:54.390
don't drill into my head,"
I wouldn't have.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.493
It's pretty simple.

23:57.495 --> 24:00.496
You can't do
what the patient doesn't want.

24:00.498 --> 24:03.348
Okay, this is what
we're gonna do.

24:03.350 --> 24:05.501
I did a deep dive
into temporary pacers.

24:05.503 --> 24:08.094
Wyatt passes out,
we get the pads on him,

24:08.096 --> 24:09.930
shock him if we need to,
slip it in

24:09.932 --> 24:11.115
-at his bedside.
-Hey.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.491
(Wyatt shouting)

24:18.106 --> 24:19.290
CONRAD:
Let's get him some O2.

24:19.292 --> 24:21.158
I'm nauseous. My stomach hurts.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.109
What's going on?

24:23.111 --> 24:25.796
Gut ischemia
from poor perfusion.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.447
Your heart rate's too low.

24:27.449 --> 24:29.041
Let's get him some pain meds.

24:29.043 --> 24:30.468
Page Bell.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.094
-Okay.
-(panting)

24:34.456 --> 24:35.639
(crying softly)

24:40.796 --> 24:42.396
BELL:
Okay.

24:45.559 --> 24:48.393
Yeah, he's-he's calmer now
with the pain meds on board.

24:48.395 --> 24:51.547
It's highly likely
he has dying bowel,

24:51.549 --> 24:54.383
but he's not a viable candidate
for surgery.

24:54.385 --> 24:55.901
Unless we get him
to agree to a pacer.

24:55.903 --> 24:59.404
And, yeah, if you do, tell me,
and I'll take him to the OR.

24:59.406 --> 25:01.332
As of now, all the complications

25:01.334 --> 25:03.834
from his untreated
heart condition are fixable,

25:03.836 --> 25:06.420
-but I don't know for how long.
-(pager beeping)

25:08.323 --> 25:10.424
He's refusing all intervention.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.994
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

25:13.996 --> 25:15.513
I wish there were.

25:20.928 --> 25:23.336
Okay, just... just hear me out.

25:23.338 --> 25:25.764
All right, you know
the Dax Cowart case, right?

25:25.766 --> 25:28.934
He wanted to die after suffering
catastrophic burns.

25:28.936 --> 25:31.420
He was in pain,
terribly disfigured, went blind.

25:31.422 --> 25:33.346
And he was ruled
to have capacity, too,

25:33.348 --> 25:37.451
but his doctors disregarded
his wishes and saved his life.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.353
Mm-hmm.

25:40.355 --> 25:43.265
Yeah, he had a career,
he had a family,

25:43.267 --> 25:46.026
I mean, he lived
until he was 71.

25:46.028 --> 25:48.862
Wyatt can have the same thing.

25:48.864 --> 25:51.197
Dax Cowart became a lawyer
and built a career

25:51.199 --> 25:52.941
on fighting
for patients' rights.

25:52.943 --> 25:55.553
He used his own case to show
what the doctors did,

25:55.555 --> 25:59.390
what you want to do to Wyatt,
was a betrayal of those rights.

25:59.392 --> 26:00.616
It's not a betrayal
of his rights.

26:00.618 --> 26:02.059
Hey, I'm as frustrated
as you are.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.211
As doctors,
our purpose is to help.

26:05.213 --> 26:06.546
And you got that part right.

26:06.548 --> 26:09.308
But Wyatt needs
to want to be helped.

26:09.310 --> 26:10.985
No, until he's dead,
I'm not giving up.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.492
Then neither am I.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.061
(washing hands)

26:21.063 --> 26:22.154
(door opens)

26:22.156 --> 26:23.730
BELL:
Sorry I'm late.

26:24.733 --> 26:27.400
Had a rough consult
with Conrad's patient.

26:27.402 --> 26:29.478
The exact opposite of Brit.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.738
He doesn't trust Conrad,
for all the wrong reasons.

26:31.740 --> 26:33.816
And here I am tied up in knots

26:33.818 --> 26:36.409
over a patient who trusts me
too much.

26:36.411 --> 26:38.003
You made
the best decision you could

26:38.005 --> 26:39.763
with the information you have.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.724
(water running)

26:44.829 --> 26:46.829
You have a very unusual
career path.

26:46.831 --> 26:49.848
What brought you from oncology
to emergency medicine?

26:49.850 --> 26:51.424
So much suffering and death.

26:51.426 --> 26:54.186
The patients call you
weeping at all hours

26:54.188 --> 26:56.429
of the day and night.

26:56.431 --> 26:59.950
I-I was worn out
from the stress.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.678
Those days ruined me. And now?

27:02.680 --> 27:05.122
Just off a shift, look at me--
I'm still fresh.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.124
Well, it must have been
a challenge to go back

27:07.126 --> 27:09.534
to residency and learn
all the ER procedures.

27:09.536 --> 27:12.187
Hmm, I'm not one
for new techniques.

27:12.189 --> 27:14.781
I pretty much slept
through that residency.

27:14.783 --> 27:17.801
-It was no big deal.
-I see.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.285
(monitor beeping steadily)

27:19.287 --> 27:20.471
WYATT:
I told you, Doc.

27:20.473 --> 27:24.683
If God wants me to live,
I'll live.

27:26.011 --> 27:29.438
He'll reach His hand down to me.

27:30.465 --> 27:33.133
He's always been so good to me.

27:33.135 --> 27:35.319
TREVOR:
Is this about luck now, Wyatt?

27:35.321 --> 27:36.195
Or God?

27:38.232 --> 27:41.992
He can't save you right now.
We can.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.161
Leave me alone, Doc.

27:46.891 --> 27:49.574
No. Wyatt...

27:49.576 --> 27:52.318
-Trevor.
-You just, you got to listen
to what I'm...

27:52.320 --> 27:54.088
Trevor. Trevor, take a walk now.

28:06.760 --> 28:08.018
He's young.

28:09.580 --> 28:12.147
But he cares deeply.

28:14.435 --> 28:17.695
And I respect your faith
in God's will.

28:17.697 --> 28:20.105
I'm in His hands now.

28:20.107 --> 28:24.259
And you always have been, right?

28:25.262 --> 28:29.623
How do you know He is not
using us to save you?

28:31.711 --> 28:34.453
You think he wasn't sitting
beside Rune Elmqvist in Sweden

28:34.455 --> 28:37.272
half a century ago
when he invented the pacemaker?

28:37.274 --> 28:40.551
He is sending you one lifeline
after another.

28:44.281 --> 28:45.472
Hey.

28:48.210 --> 28:50.728
I'll ask Him.

28:52.623 --> 28:54.189
Wyatt?

29:09.731 --> 29:12.065
Wyatt.

29:12.067 --> 29:15.235
(laughs)

29:15.237 --> 29:17.379
(ragged breathing)

29:27.266 --> 29:29.433
BELL:
Yeah, the liver is exposed.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.009
LEELA:
Ready to begin the enucleation.

29:31.011 --> 29:33.328
BELL:
Remember, the beauty
of this technique is that we,

29:33.330 --> 29:35.939
we work along existing planes
to pop the mass out

29:35.941 --> 29:37.441
and we leave the liver intact.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.259
That's how we avoid
massive bleeding.

29:39.261 --> 29:42.521
And note the vessels
extending into the liver.

29:42.523 --> 29:45.098
Divide and ligate.

29:45.100 --> 29:47.743
Be careful.

29:49.029 --> 29:50.529
LEELA:
Ugh, I have a tiny bleeder.

29:50.531 --> 29:51.747
Cautery.

29:54.184 --> 29:56.368
And another one.

29:56.370 --> 29:57.628
Okay, suction.

30:03.043 --> 30:04.551
Okay, that's arterial. Clamp.

30:07.197 --> 30:09.348
JESSICA:
Dr. Bell? Here's the clamp.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.562
LEELA:
Are you okay?

30:16.965 --> 30:18.206
BELL:
Uh, no.

30:18.208 --> 30:19.566
LEELA:
Jessica, I'll take it.

30:21.303 --> 30:22.802
BELL:
Uh, Dr. Devi, I have to leave.

30:22.804 --> 30:24.729
LEELA:
What?

30:24.731 --> 30:26.064
BELL:
I-I'll find someone to cover
as soon as possible.

30:26.066 --> 30:27.324
Uh, as soon as possible.

30:31.497 --> 30:32.746
LEELA:
Dr. Bell.

30:39.246 --> 30:40.712
JESSICA:
You can do this.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.923
LEELA: I've got the mass
on the last vascular pedicle.

30:51.925 --> 30:53.666
Any word from Bell?

30:53.668 --> 30:55.093
JESSICA:
Nothing yet. You'll probably
get this sucker out of here

30:55.095 --> 30:56.728
before anyone comes.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.356
(monitor beeping rapidly)

30:59.358 --> 31:01.859
CHU:
Pressure's drifting down,
Dr. Devi.

31:01.861 --> 31:04.753
LEELA:
She's losing blood. Let's get
some blood products in her.

31:04.755 --> 31:06.029
JESSICA:
Tell me what you need.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.757
Lap pads and suction.
I'm operating underwater here.

31:08.759 --> 31:10.258
If I can't find the source for
the bleeding, I can't fix it.

31:10.260 --> 31:11.593
CHU:
Two units are in,
and I activated

31:11.595 --> 31:14.096
massive transfusion protocol.
We're maxed on norepi.

31:14.098 --> 31:16.356
LEELA:
Found it.

31:16.358 --> 31:17.357
CHU:
You've got to get control.
She won't tolerate

31:17.359 --> 31:19.192
this blood loss much longer.

31:19.194 --> 31:20.878
LEELA:
I need to remove the portion
of the liver

31:20.880 --> 31:22.454
the vessel is feeding.
Prepare for a hepatectomy.

31:22.456 --> 31:24.940
JESSICA:
That's a serious change
in plans.

31:24.942 --> 31:25.941
We should call Dr. Bell first.

31:25.943 --> 31:27.459
LEELA:
No time. Clamp, now.

31:27.461 --> 31:30.779
Chu, give her 1:1:1
resuscitation to keep up.

31:30.781 --> 31:32.598
-Jessica, do not stop
that suction.
-JESSICA: Got it.

31:38.789 --> 31:40.022
LEELA:
Got it.

31:42.050 --> 31:43.308
CHU:
We've got a stable pressure.

31:43.310 --> 31:45.961
-(chuckles)
-CHU: Strong work, Dr. Devi.

31:45.963 --> 31:48.130
(Leela sighs)

31:48.132 --> 31:49.573
JESSICA:
You did it.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.891
-(chuckles)
-LEELA: Let's get her closed up

31:51.893 --> 31:53.577
and off this table.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.402
What do you think
the evidence is

32:02.404 --> 32:03.828
behind cookies
for stress relief?

32:03.830 --> 32:05.238
NOLAN:
Anecdotal

32:05.240 --> 32:07.332
-but robust.
-I'm really feeling

32:07.334 --> 32:09.484
-the chocolate chip.
-HUNDLEY: Dr. Austin?

32:09.486 --> 32:10.761
Of all people.

32:10.763 --> 32:12.578
Do raptors do yoga?

32:12.580 --> 32:16.174
I'm only here because my CEO
told me I had to be here.

32:16.176 --> 32:17.342
But I won't be here for long.

32:17.344 --> 32:19.161
I have to round
on the post-ops again

32:19.163 --> 32:20.512
before I fly
to Manhattan tonight

32:20.514 --> 32:22.922
-for talk shows tomorrow.
-DEVON: Well, I'm stiff,

32:22.924 --> 32:23.999
my back is in knots.

32:24.001 --> 32:25.425
I've been in interviews all day,

32:25.427 --> 32:28.503
looking for an actual doctor
who likes actual doctoring.

32:28.505 --> 32:30.030
PADMA:
Welcome, health care heroes.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.008
Uh, listen, I am not a man

32:33.010 --> 32:34.600
that you will find
in Child's Pose.

32:34.602 --> 32:36.194
So I'm just gonna be
on my way to...

32:36.196 --> 32:37.729
AJ, I happen to know
from personal experience

32:37.731 --> 32:40.699
that you could really benefit
from a little extra flexibility.

32:40.701 --> 32:44.586
-(laughter)
-All right, come lie down
and grab a mat.

32:46.356 --> 32:49.207
-Close your eyes.
-(grunting)

32:49.209 --> 32:53.453
Let the world fade away
and just relax.

32:53.455 --> 32:55.455
-(pager beeps)
-It's the ER.

32:55.457 --> 32:56.364
(pagers beeping)

32:56.366 --> 32:57.790
Oh, that's my next interview.

32:57.792 --> 32:59.367
Med-surg floor.

32:59.369 --> 33:01.436
My mother's having
another complication.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.208
-(beeping stops)
-I mean, I feel

33:06.210 --> 33:07.467
so blissed out right now.

33:07.469 --> 33:09.802
I feel like I'm back to zero.
I feel great.

33:09.804 --> 33:12.547
You know,
after this is all done,

33:12.549 --> 33:15.325
I think that you and I should go
to this great little vegan place

33:15.327 --> 33:16.551
that I know about in Inman Park.

33:16.553 --> 33:17.736
It-It's wonderful.

33:17.904 --> 33:20.222
It's the best tempeh à la King
you will ever have.

33:20.224 --> 33:23.583
You're cute. Not a chance.

33:24.728 --> 33:25.711
(sighs)

33:27.489 --> 33:29.673
-That's a, that's a no, then?
-(pager beeps)

33:32.660 --> 33:35.403
Okay, Wyatt Barnes' heart rate
is in the 20s.

33:35.405 --> 33:37.072
He has gut ischemia,
his kidneys are failing.

33:37.074 --> 33:38.240
Without a pacer, he's dying.

33:38.242 --> 33:40.075
We're running out of time,
and he's waiting

33:40.077 --> 33:41.259
for the hand of God
to reach down

33:41.411 --> 33:43.020
-and-and save him from...
-First of all, back up.

33:43.022 --> 33:44.579
You're in my personal space.

33:44.581 --> 33:46.748
And you have intern coffee
breath, which I do not like.

33:46.750 --> 33:48.416
Okay, look, look, look,
with all due respect,

33:48.418 --> 33:50.585
Dr. Hawkins seems
to have lost his edge,

33:50.587 --> 33:52.512
it's gonna cost
a young dude his life.

33:52.514 --> 33:53.755
Can you please
just put in a pacer, please?

33:53.757 --> 33:55.940
-I have one right here, come on.
-Put that away.

33:55.942 --> 33:57.275
You are a green recruit

33:57.277 --> 33:59.427
questioning the general
on the field.

33:59.429 --> 34:00.779
W-Wait, hold up. If someone came
into this hospital

34:00.781 --> 34:02.931
after slitting their wrists
or-or taking pills,

34:02.933 --> 34:04.115
we'd save them, right?

34:04.117 --> 34:05.617
Wyatt Barnes is doing
the same thing.

34:05.619 --> 34:07.360
This is not a suicide.

34:07.362 --> 34:10.438
This is a man with capacity
refusing intervention.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.440
That's a right
we cannot abridge.

34:12.442 --> 34:13.866
His recalcitrance
is not jeopardizing

34:13.868 --> 34:15.460
anyone else's health.

34:15.462 --> 34:17.629
-He's only hurting himself.
-Okay, but he is
hurting himself...

34:17.631 --> 34:18.947
Trevor, stop.

34:18.949 --> 34:22.208
Now you go back
to your patient's room.

34:22.210 --> 34:26.137
You watch Dr. Hawkins
and you do what he says.

34:26.139 --> 34:29.048
Stop second-guessing him.

34:29.050 --> 34:30.692
You might learn something.

34:36.057 --> 34:39.058
(monitor beeping steadily)

34:39.060 --> 34:41.745
Please let me save you, Wyatt.

34:44.583 --> 34:47.459
I have everything we need.
You just say the word.

34:51.164 --> 34:53.090
Think of all
the beautiful things

34:53.092 --> 34:56.093
you'll never be able
to experience again.

34:56.095 --> 34:59.429
I don't know what happens
when you die,

34:59.431 --> 35:01.681
but I bet you don't get
to kiss a woman...

35:03.343 --> 35:06.520
...and know you want to be with
her for the rest of your life.

35:08.256 --> 35:11.775
Don't you want to wake up
on the first day of fall?

35:11.777 --> 35:13.835
Eat a peach?

35:13.837 --> 35:15.428
(laughs)

35:15.430 --> 35:18.115
Laugh your ass off
with your best friends?

35:18.117 --> 35:20.099
You don't have to give up
any of that.

35:20.101 --> 35:22.844
Think of how lucky
that makes you.

35:22.846 --> 35:25.038
(laughs softly)

35:42.975 --> 35:45.058
Is he still saying no?

35:55.803 --> 35:57.896
(exhales)

35:57.898 --> 35:59.114
Do it.

36:00.642 --> 36:02.075
Please.

36:15.823 --> 36:18.733
What are we here for,
anyway, huh?

36:18.735 --> 36:24.572
To watch people
we could save just... just die?

36:24.574 --> 36:27.392
I was here to save him.

36:28.836 --> 36:33.440
Now we're just here to make sure
he doesn't die alone.

36:36.086 --> 36:37.694
(sniffles)

36:51.768 --> 36:53.585
(flatlining)

37:12.973 --> 37:15.523
He's your first death.

37:19.312 --> 37:21.554
Yeah.

37:21.556 --> 37:24.132
Not how I imagined
it would go down.

37:24.134 --> 37:28.152
You pictured a different
kind of heroism,

37:28.154 --> 37:31.665
blood spattered
all over your white coat.

37:33.827 --> 37:36.402
(exhales)

37:36.404 --> 37:39.005
Do you ever get used to it?

37:40.074 --> 37:43.093
It never gets easier. It just...

37:43.095 --> 37:45.095
It just gets different.

37:46.673 --> 37:52.435
But today was no small
accomplishment. Dr. Daniels.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.610
We allowed him to live and die
according to his principles,

38:00.612 --> 38:03.530
and because of that,
we managed to keep ours.

38:11.515 --> 38:15.292
Look, again, I'm-I'm sorry
about what happened in there.

38:15.294 --> 38:17.276
Well, I'm relieved you're okay.

38:17.278 --> 38:19.296
No, I-I'll be fine, it's just...

38:19.298 --> 38:21.706
It's a pinched nerve and...

38:21.708 --> 38:23.858
little bit of vertigo
that came on suddenly.

38:23.860 --> 38:26.494
I think, you know,
I-I overreacted,

38:26.496 --> 38:29.697
but in the moment, I-I thought
if I stayed in the OR,

38:29.699 --> 38:32.383
you'd have two patients
to deal with, so...

38:32.385 --> 38:34.811
Well, then,
you did the right thing.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.980
So did you.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.464
This time.

38:38.466 --> 38:41.401
But, to be honest,
it could have gone either way.

38:49.328 --> 38:51.719
-Hi.
-So?

38:51.721 --> 38:54.164
Did you find anything else
horrible inside me?

38:54.166 --> 38:56.482
I'm vaguely optimistic

38:56.484 --> 38:59.836
because I have a familiar sense
of existential dread,

38:59.838 --> 39:02.897
and I'm pretty sure that can't
be removed surgically.

39:02.899 --> 39:04.399
The surgery went great.

39:04.401 --> 39:05.917
You're going to be fine.

39:05.919 --> 39:07.569
Thanks to Dr. Devi.

39:07.571 --> 39:10.238
There was a complication
during surgery.

39:10.240 --> 39:12.015
We had to remove
a small piece of your liver.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.075
But it will grow back.

39:14.077 --> 39:15.501
And the hemangioma
is gone for good.

39:15.503 --> 39:18.596
Thank you.
I mean, really, thank you.

39:18.598 --> 39:21.599
And you made the right decision
for me, too.

39:21.601 --> 39:25.086
Can I call you next time
I'm buying a new car?

39:25.088 --> 39:26.254
-(laughs)
-Or don't know what to do

39:26.256 --> 39:28.256
when I get in a fight
with my mom?

39:28.258 --> 39:29.699
I actually am
a triple board-certified

39:29.701 --> 39:30.850
mother vanquisher.

39:30.852 --> 39:32.160
(chuckles)

39:36.600 --> 39:38.691
DEVON:
So...

39:38.693 --> 39:40.585
it's a no.

39:42.363 --> 39:44.472
Even the former oncologist?

39:44.474 --> 39:45.698
He's burnt out.

39:45.700 --> 39:47.942
He's not interested
in learning anything new.

39:47.944 --> 39:50.795
H-He doesn't love medicine.

39:50.797 --> 39:52.296
None of them do.

39:52.298 --> 39:54.039
Keep looking.
It's just the first round.

39:54.041 --> 39:55.950
No need to be discouraged.

39:55.952 --> 39:57.543
And the thing is, Dr. Voss,

39:57.545 --> 40:00.121
when I was talking to them,
I realized

40:00.123 --> 40:01.731
I might not be so different.

40:02.959 --> 40:04.317
Of course you are, Dr. Pravesh.

40:05.720 --> 40:09.072
I am judging people
for not loving medicine enough

40:09.074 --> 40:11.799
while trying to cut down
on clinical time

40:11.801 --> 40:12.892
to go do research.

40:12.894 --> 40:14.652
I think about being in the ER

40:14.654 --> 40:19.323
year after year after year,
with no outlet for research,

40:19.325 --> 40:22.401
and I don't know how we don't
drown in the sickness,

40:22.403 --> 40:25.997
the sadness, the pressure,
the paperwork.

40:25.999 --> 40:27.590
(exhales)

40:27.592 --> 40:31.428
Half of my med school class
isn't doing medicine anymore.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.432
That means something.

40:36.250 --> 40:40.728
Yes, I think it does.

40:57.030 --> 40:58.413
BELL:
Hey.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.852
Hell of a day.

41:04.854 --> 41:07.297
Yeah, I heard.

41:07.299 --> 41:09.615
So, how tempted were you
to put in the pacer

41:09.617 --> 41:13.118
-against the patient's wishes?
-More than I'd like to admit.

41:13.120 --> 41:15.863
But there are some rules
we can't break.

41:15.865 --> 41:18.499
Do I know I made
the right choice? Yeah.

41:18.501 --> 41:21.627
Do I wish I'd made
the wrong one? Maybe.

41:21.629 --> 41:23.462
I know my intern thinks so.

41:23.464 --> 41:27.800
I heard Dr. Daniels has
a hard time with the rules.

41:27.802 --> 41:30.394
But maybe the example you set
saved his medical career.

41:30.396 --> 41:32.489
To say nothing of your
responsibility to your patient.

41:32.491 --> 41:34.398
Yeah, he's a bright kid,
that Trevor,

41:34.400 --> 41:36.326
but too much confidence
and passion,

41:36.328 --> 41:38.703
not nearly enough restraint.

41:44.151 --> 41:46.461
He learned something today.

41:52.919 --> 41:54.402
If I'd have saved Wyatt,

41:54.404 --> 41:57.013
would he have come back
in ten years

41:57.015 --> 41:59.331
with an armload of kids,

41:59.333 --> 42:02.477
grateful that we didn't
listen to him?

42:05.765 --> 42:07.065
(exhales)

42:09.586 --> 42:12.028
And now I realize none of this
is why you are here.

42:15.349 --> 42:16.616
Nope.

42:18.094 --> 42:20.036
I got a favor to ask you.

42:24.876 --> 42:26.284
What?

42:26.286 --> 42:29.212
But, look, before
I even-even spell it out,

42:29.214 --> 42:32.790
can I count on you
for full confidentiality?

42:32.792 --> 42:34.425
Go on.

42:36.721 --> 42:40.056
Something's wrong with me,
a-and I'm not quite sure what.

42:41.968 --> 42:43.726
But I think it may be serious.

42:44.929 --> 42:46.396
You want me to examine you?

42:46.398 --> 42:48.064
Yeah, I'll clear
my schedule tomorrow.

42:48.066 --> 42:50.291
Let's come in early.

42:50.293 --> 42:53.978
And the fact that I'm being
tested at all,

42:53.980 --> 42:57.465
the results,
all under the radar.

42:57.467 --> 42:59.725
So, is that something
you can do?

42:59.727 --> 43:01.744
(sighs)
