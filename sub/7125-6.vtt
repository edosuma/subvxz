WEBVTT

00:09.450 --> 00:12.060
since I have to rely on other 
people to tell me who I am

00:12.110 --> 00:14.350
I don't get to spend that much time alone.

00:14.450 --> 00:19.300
In fact the last time I had some peace 
and quiet was when I was in my coma.

00:19.580 --> 00:23.160
I'm so looking forward to the day
when I can be completely independent.

00:23.210 --> 00:24.470
but in the meantime,

00:24.520 --> 00:28.360
it's pretty cool when I figure 
something out all by myself.

00:30.510 --> 00:33.820
- oh,no! Oh,no!
- Unplug it! Unplug it!

00:35.840 --> 00:38.500
What are you doing? Don't you know you're 
not supposed to put metal in a microwave?

00:38.550 --> 00:39.840
Well,I do now!

00:39.890 --> 00:43.520
God,you'd think something that important
they'd have it written on there or something.

00:43.570 --> 00:45.460
Why are you cooking in my apartment?
Why aren't you home?

00:45.510 --> 00:47.110
Because my mom won't 
let me use the stove

00:47.160 --> 00:49.000
cause she said I'll burn the house down.

00:49.100 --> 00:50.540
Oh,man.

00:50.590 --> 00:51.600
What's wrong with your leg?

00:51.650 --> 00:54.860
Nothing.I just--I had to go up and down the 
stairs five times to get stuff from the grocery.

00:54.910 --> 00:57.000
I swear when I get my own apartment,

00:57.050 --> 00:59.030
I am going to live in a one-story building

00:59.080 --> 01:02.160
inhabited only by people who share 
my dislike of elevators.

01:02.210 --> 01:05.040
Dislike?
Is that what we call a paralyzing phobia now?

01:05.090 --> 01:06.130
Have you ever been in an elevator?

01:06.180 --> 01:09.320
It is like riding in a coffin falling down a mine shaft.

01:09.410 --> 01:13.420
Look,I'm just frustrated with my learning curve
or my relearning curve.

01:13.470 --> 01:16.480
Someday I'm gonna have to be taking care of myself
and I'm gonna have to learn how to cook.

01:16.530 --> 01:18.070
Well,that'll be a first
You never cooked before.

01:18.170 --> 01:19.950
Yeah,well,I do now.

01:20.190 --> 01:23.380
Check this out.

01:29.620 --> 01:31.760
That'S,saucy.

01:31.810 --> 01:34.270
Did you put oregano in that?

01:34.480 --> 01:36.060
Why?

01:36.270 --> 01:37.110
Oh.

01:37.160 --> 01:40.700
so I'm allergic to oregano.

01:40.750 --> 01:43.970
- Whats oregano again?
- It's a spice.

01:44.450 --> 01:46.000
you guys suck.

01:46.050 --> 01:49.550
Oh,I would kill to have a food allergy
It's like nature's diet.

01:49.600 --> 01:53.150
I spent five years trying to 
become lactose-intolerant.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.310
God,I can't take care of myself.
I can't even feed myself.

01:57.410 --> 02:00.340
Okay,enough with sam time
Now it's andrea time.

02:00.390 --> 02:04.100
So.I remember this guy 
I dated named peter

02:05.300 --> 02:07.760
Can we make sure to leave

02:07.810 --> 02:11.330
Because sometimes we run 
out most of the time,

02:11.380 --> 02:14.800
- if not
-So,sam,you remember peter,right?

02:14.850 --> 02:17.330
We met him here the night we 
discovered sake bombs?

02:17.380 --> 02:20.080
No,andrea.I don't remember

02:20.130 --> 02:24.430
because I have amnesia.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.510
Okay,back to me.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.870
Anyway,I cannot remember 
his phone number,

02:28.920 --> 02:31.580
so I went to this hypnotherapist to 
see if she could help.

02:31.630 --> 02:34.010
- Ooh!Did it work?
- Not yet,but...

02:34.060 --> 02:35.200
wait a minute.

02:35.250 --> 02:40.390
A hypno was it hypnotherapist can 
help you get your memories back?

02:40.440 --> 02:45.330
Oh,yeah. They can help with lots 
of things insomnia,smoking.

02:45.770 --> 02:47.270
fear of dinosaurs.

02:47.320 --> 02:50.120
Can you maybe put me in touch 
with your hypnotherapist?

02:50.170 --> 02:52.030
Yes,that is a great idea!

02:52.080 --> 02:55.730
Yes,you were here the night peter 
gave me his number!
Maybe you'll remember it!

02:55.780 --> 02:57.380
Um,actually.

02:57.430 --> 02:58.610
andrea,I was thinking about

02:58.660 --> 03:01.560
you know maybe getting some 
of my memories back

03:01.610 --> 03:03.230
you know,about me

03:04.050 --> 03:06.050
it's still andrea time.

03:06.180 --> 03:10.060
Okay,so guess what I remember?

03:18.880 --> 03:22.610
Samantha,you are not going to to 
see any hypnotherapist.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.240
And what is wrong with me trying to 
get my memories back?

03:25.290 --> 03:27.670
Don't do it,sam.Those guys are charlatans.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.210
We saw one in branson.
He made me think I was a duck.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.790
- Howard!That was a hypnotist
- I don't care what he was.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.050
He made me quack the 
oscar mayer wiener song.

03:36.100 --> 03:37.540
It was humiliating.

03:37.590 --> 03:38.990
Why,why are you being like this?

03:39.040 --> 03:41.300
I mean,is there something that you 
don't want me to find out about?

03:41.350 --> 03:43.500
I just don't want you digging 
around in your past.

03:43.550 --> 03:45.990
You know,most people would pay to 
forget the things you've done.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.990
Well,it's too bad because they're my 
memories,and I want them.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.230
Well,you may think you want them.

03:50.280 --> 03:52.020
- You remember when you were 8?
- No.

03:52.070 --> 03:55.850
You thought you wanted a trampoline
until you hit your head on that beehive.

03:56.270 --> 03:59.650
Why would you put a trampoline underneath a beehive?

03:59.700 --> 04:02.170
To keep you from jumping too high.

04:02.220 --> 04:05.090
- Everything I have done is for your own good.
- Really?

04:05.140 --> 04:07.990
- Even when you tell me things that aren't true?
- I've never lied to you.

04:08.040 --> 04:12.780
Two weeks ago,you told me that my best friend in high school
was an exchange student from prague.

04:12.830 --> 04:15.490
- But you loved helena.
- You made her up!

04:15.540 --> 04:18.730
Well,forgive me for trying to broaden your ctural experiences.

04:21.089 --> 04:22.940
when I count backward from three,

04:22.990 --> 04:26.520
you'll open your eyes and remember everything we just uncovered.

04:26.570 --> 04:30.720
Ready?Three.Two.One.

04:30.810 --> 04:32.660
I'm adopted!

04:36.480 --> 04:38.960
I am adopted!Yes!

04:39.010 --> 04:41.930
I am not genetically destined to turn out like those two.

04:41.980 --> 04:43.870
I wonder what your birth parents are like.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.900
Maybe your mom's a princess.ooh!

04:46.940 --> 04:48.760
Maybe your dad's a ninja.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.980
what if your dad's hot?

04:51.090 --> 04:52.320
I'm just saying.

04:52.390 --> 04:54.750
You might wanna stay away from dating older men right now

04:54.890 --> 04:57.680
- just in case
- I think something's wrong with you.

04:57.730 --> 04:59.270
Why wouldn't they tell me about this?

04:59.320 --> 05:01.040
What? Who cares? You're adopted.

05:01.090 --> 05:02.950
It is so in right now,I can't even tell you.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.750
Really,get some bronzer
You can be from anywhere in the world.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.950
Did I mention the necklace?

05:07.000 --> 05:10.550
I remember that I had this heart-shaped necklace
that my birth parents gave me.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.500
Oh,god.I want it.Where is it?

05:12.550 --> 05:15.430
It's all very stressful.
Oh,I need a cigarette.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.930
- No,no,you don't smoke.
- Well,apparently,I used to.

05:18.980 --> 05:20.560
Thank you,hypnotherapy.

05:20.610 --> 05:23.760
Actually,you started smoking because of me,you know?

05:23.860 --> 05:25.890
Yeah,we used to hide cigarettes in the vent

05:25.940 --> 05:28.840
in your room and smoke when your mom was out.

05:28.910 --> 05:31.610
I thought it would make us fit in better with the cool kids.

05:32.170 --> 05:34.060
It worked for one of us.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.160
Guess which one?

05:37.100 --> 05:37.880
all right.

05:37.930 --> 05:41.530
Well,I'm gonna go home
and I'm gonna tell them that I know that I'm adopted,

05:41.580 --> 05:43.220
and you know what? We're gonna sit down

05:43.270 --> 05:46.950
and we're gonna have a grown-up conversation like grown-ups.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.250
And ding!
Did you remember peter's number?

05:52.560 --> 05:54.420
- Mom
- ad?

05:55.180 --> 05:57.430
I found out what you didn't want me to know.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.950
I'm adopted.

06:04.050 --> 06:05.880
adopted!

06:05.930 --> 06:07.280
No such luck,kiddo.

06:07.330 --> 06:08.900
Is that what the hypnotherapist told you?

06:08.950 --> 06:13.840
Yes,but it's okay
because families can be made in many different ways,

06:13.890 --> 06:16.770
and because you chose me,that makes me special.

06:16.820 --> 06:19.190
Chose you?No.We didn't choose you.

06:19.240 --> 06:22.550
Oh,honey,this is what I warned you about
You let people fill your head with ideas.

06:22.600 --> 06:26.340
It's like when you went to that guidance counselor
and he told you you were gifted.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.760
Okay.Well,then can I please see my birth certificate?

06:29.810 --> 06:31.230
You don't have one.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.730
You drew all over it with a green marker when you were 4 years old.

06:33.780 --> 06:35.950
- Well,I can still see it
- No.

06:36.130 --> 06:38.180
- Then we lost it
- Hmm.

06:38.230 --> 06:40.750
Well,then I will just order another one.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.940
Well,good luck with that
You were born in international waters.

06:43.990 --> 06:46.620
Really? On a pirate ship?

06:46.670 --> 06:49.250
- A cruise ship.
- Almost named you "carnival."

06:49.440 --> 06:53.580
mm,wow.
You guys must have some really amazing photos from that trip,huh?

06:56.540 --> 07:01.770
- We should tell her
- What? It's okay.Just tell me.

07:02.710 --> 07:06.180
One night,your dad and i were out back in the garden,

07:06.480 --> 07:10.080
and somebody broke into the house
and stole all your photo albums.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.330
Oh,not someone.

07:11.540 --> 07:13.340
It was that shawn miller kid.

07:13.390 --> 07:16.080
And if I wanted to find this shawn miller kid.

07:16.310 --> 07:17.740
turns out it wasn't even his real name.

07:17.790 --> 07:19.000
Of course not!

07:19.050 --> 07:20.260
His family was here illegally.

07:20.310 --> 07:22.790
They got deported before we got any of the pictures back.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.170
Yeah,they were kurds or something.

07:24.220 --> 07:26.000
Oh,honey,they were icelandic.

07:26.050 --> 07:28.620
Yeah,see,no one suspects an icelander.

07:28.670 --> 07:33.750
You ever noticed that "reykjavik" and "wreak havoc" are eerily s--

07:33.830 --> 07:35.780
where'd she go?

07:37.280 --> 07:40.600
- Maybe the hynotherapist was wrong
- Mnh-mnh.No.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.850
You should have heard them
They had an answer for everything.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.690
Now I'm not worried that I was adopted.
I'm afraid I was kidnapped.

07:45.770 --> 07:49.440
- You have a very interesting life.
- Mm,don't I?

07:49.620 --> 07:51.450
I just want the truth,that's all.

07:51.530 --> 07:53.320
And a cigarette.Ugh!

07:53.370 --> 07:56.570
Ooh,you know,something funny did happen to me today.

07:56.620 --> 08:00.220
well,my dog into my closet,and when he came out...

08:00.270 --> 08:01.730
that's hilarious.I gotta go.

08:03.510 --> 08:06.170
damn it.I forgot to call "dena time."

08:33.230 --> 08:34.940
What? What is that?

08:35.070 --> 08:37.470
Don't look,regina.She's trying to hypnotize us.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.850
This is a necklace given to me by my birth parents.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.890
I knew it! Admit it.I'm adopted.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.200
No,no,samantha.Look,come and talk.

08:45.250 --> 08:46.650
Why? So you can tell me more lies?

08:46.700 --> 08:48.400
Oh,no.No,let me guess.Um,

08:48.450 --> 08:52.310
I'm from the future
or maybe you rescued me from the pit of a volcano.

08:52.360 --> 08:55.150
- Okay,just calm down.
- I'm not gonna calm down!

08:55.200 --> 08:58.410
I trust you two to tell me the truth
but obviously,you can'T.

08:58.460 --> 09:02.260
And you know what?
I can't afford to have relationships that are based in lies

09:02.310 --> 09:04.560
because I need to know who I am.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.490
I don't even care if I'm adopted,

09:06.540 --> 09:09.090
but I just don't feel safe here with you anymore.

09:09.140 --> 09:09.810
You know what?

09:09.860 --> 09:13.230
I'm leaving,'cause you're not my parents and this is not my home!

09:13.280 --> 09:17.790
- Samantha,don't do this!
- Ugh! I'm not a duck!I'm not a duck!

09:18.780 --> 09:20.410
bestfriends are there for you

09:21.820 --> 09:23.440
so.i just left

09:24.310 --> 09:27.180
Whoever those people are I just I couldn't be there anymore.

09:27.230 --> 09:30.260
Well,good for you.You did the right thing.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.430
so.where are you gonna stay?

09:33.480 --> 09:35.580
Well,I thought I would just stay here.

09:35.630 --> 09:38.050
Mm!Oh,why would you think that?

09:38.100 --> 09:42.140
- Because we're best friends.
- Yes,we are!

09:42.190 --> 09:46.140
But we're also grown-ups
and grown-ups take care of themselves.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.960
This isn't--this is not how this was supposed to happen.

09:49.010 --> 09:51.050
You're--you're supposed to say,you know,

09:51.100 --> 09:53.970
"oh,sam,sweetie,you can stay as long as you want

09:54.020 --> 09:56.520
and--and--and then we eat cookies.

09:56.570 --> 09:58.610
Well,sam,you're making me feel like a bad friend.

09:58.660 --> 10:01.050
Well,you're being a bad friend.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.280
Look at this.See that hole?

10:03.520 --> 10:05.520
That hole is when you and i tried to live together.

10:05.570 --> 10:07.210
You threw a lamp at me.

10:07.260 --> 10:09.640
- Why did I do that?
- Because I threw a lamp at you.

10:09.690 --> 10:14.310
- Over what?
- I don't know.It was something about a scrunchie.

10:14.700 --> 10:17.120
- Point is,no.
- But,andrea,I'm different now.

10:17.170 --> 10:23.140
But I'm not,and I care about being your friend
way too much to be here for you,okay?

10:23.190 --> 10:26.370
- Yeah.
- Get your bag.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.610
- Did you remember peter's nu--
- no!

10:29.660 --> 10:31.860
ex-boy friends are there for you

10:33.720 --> 10:35.160
Thank you for letting me stay here.

10:35.210 --> 10:36.580
Is it okay if I move these pillows?

10:36.630 --> 10:38.190
Oh,it's your place.You can do whatever you want.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.740
You used to freak out if the little one ended up behind the big one.

10:40.790 --> 10:41.810
You know what?

10:41.860 --> 10:45.040
I apologize for everything that I have ever said.

10:45.090 --> 10:47.320
I'm actually gonna make little cards that have that printed on it.

10:47.370 --> 10:48.420
Well,it's not so much what you said,

10:48.470 --> 10:52.610
but the skin on your face would kind of pull back,and al your eyes.

10:52.770 --> 10:54.650
teeth and skull.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.980
You kinda looked like a great white shark.

10:58.370 --> 11:00.230
you know,maybe I'll put these pillows back like they were.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.410
No,no,no,no.
Please,it's fine.It's fine.

11:02.460 --> 11:06.190
See?
You were always straight with me,even if it makes me look bad.

11:06.450 --> 11:09.090
- Right
- That's what I like about you,though,todd.

11:09.370 --> 11:10.730
You always tell me the truth.

11:10.780 --> 11:12.810
You are just a good and decent human being,

11:12.860 --> 11:15.770
and there just aren't a lot of you out there in the world.

11:15.820 --> 11:18.210
No,I promise you.
I will get out of here first thing in the morning.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.790
I am gonna go find my own place.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.540
Well,this is your place.

11:22.590 --> 11:24.640
that's very nice of you,but I don't wanna get in the way.

11:24.690 --> 11:26.560
No,I-I mean,

11:26.700 --> 11:29.410
this is your place.

11:29.460 --> 11:33.990
You  iughtt with your money that.

11:34.330 --> 11:35.840
- that you made.
- Hmm.

11:36.670 --> 11:41.610
You're telling me.that I own this apartment?

11:41.660 --> 11:42.200
Yeah.

11:42.420 --> 11:45.820
This is my ple?

11:45.870 --> 11:47.930
There it is--the great white shark!

11:47.980 --> 11:50.880
- You let me move out?
- You said you wanted to.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.700
Beuse I thought that I had to!

11:52.750 --> 11:56.100
It would have been nice for me
to be able to make that decision on my own.

11:56.100 --> 11:59.430
Oh,god,and you just let me stand there
and thank you for telling me the truth

11:59.480 --> 12:03.750
when at any point
you could've just added that you're just a big,fat freeloading liar.

12:03.800 --> 12:04.360
Get out.

12:04.410 --> 12:06.810
- Wait,sam
- no,no.Get out.Out.

12:06.810 --> 12:10.600
I cannot believe anything that you or my friends
or my family tell me anymore

12:10.650 --> 12:13.980
so I am living in a liar-free zone.

12:14.030 --> 12:15.040
Where am I supposed to go?

12:15.090 --> 12:19.180
Can't hear you! Liar-free zone.

12:21.630 --> 12:23.160
Finally.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.380
Samantha time.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.320
[who needs 'em?]
Uh,yeah,I'd like to order something.

12:28.370 --> 12:30.410
Yeah,uh,that's the thing,actually.

12:30.740 --> 12:32.600
I don't really know what it is that I can eat,

12:32.650 --> 12:36.640
so,um,kung pao beef--is that dangerous?

12:36.740 --> 12:38.100
No?Oh.

12:38.150 --> 12:41.400
'Cause it says it says "pow" right in it.

12:41.450 --> 12:46.650
Actually,uh,can you just bring me a bunch of stuff
and stand next to me to see if I die?

12:49.750 --> 12:51.520
Gum.Cigarettes!Cigarettes.!

12:51.900 --> 12:53.590
That'll kill my appetite.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.420
Okay.

12:57.290 --> 12:59.700
(Mouth full) matches,matches,matches,matches.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.290
Mm.Okay,no.

13:09.450 --> 13:12.630
Oh!Oh,my god!

13:32.550 --> 13:34.950
ugar es grande.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.860
finally,the truth

13:40.050 --> 13:41.290
Hey,frank.

13:41.390 --> 13:45.830
Isn't it just great to just be all by yourself like you are
just all day long?

13:45.880 --> 13:48.650
Please keep moving in a forward motion.Thank you.

13:48.650 --> 13:50.650
Yeah,you know what?
I can do whatever I want,too.

13:50.700 --> 13:53.200
Like,just now,I just got back from the hypnotherapist.

13:53.250 --> 13:57.100
You know what?
I learned more in that 45-minute session than anybody in my life

13:57.150 --> 13:58.580
has been telling me in weeks.

13:58.630 --> 14:02.570
First of all,I'm adopted.I don't know if I told youhat.

14:02.570 --> 14:06.730
But I also remember this big,tall,bald man
who I'm pretty sure is my birth father,

14:06.810 --> 14:10.030
and he gave me this beautiful heart-shaped locket,

14:10.080 --> 14:16.530
and I had all these friends and we would just sing all the time
and have these amazing adventures.

14:16.530 --> 14:17.850
And did you have a dog?

14:18.010 --> 14:19.100
Yeah!I did.

14:19.150 --> 14:21.240
- Named sandy?
- Yes.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.180
How did you know that?

14:22.230 --> 14:24.590
- Because that's "annie.
- Annie?

14:25.080 --> 14:31.210
- Who's annie?
- Maybe far away or maybe real nearby

14:31.300 --> 14:34.290
he may be pouring her coffee
(coffee)

14:35.220 --> 14:40.120
she may be straightening his tie

14:40.620 --> 14:43.570
oh!That is "annie."

14:43.620 --> 14:48.470
I played annie.Oh,gosh,my parents.My mom!

14:48.760 --> 14:51.600
I said some very bad things.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.840
I guess that means I didn't meet president roosevelt,huh?

14:58.200 --> 15:00.500
I feel so stupid for not remember this.

15:00.550 --> 15:02.810
I was even in the play,too.See?

15:02.860 --> 15:05.460
"Understudy

15:05.510 --> 15:08.370
but you never got sick.Not one night,no.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.950
Healthy as a horse.

15:11.790 --> 15:15.140
My poor mom.I can neve hfaceer again.

15:15.190 --> 15:16.420
Why don't you tell her you're sorry?

15:16.470 --> 15:19.730
"Sorry" is not gonna be good enough,not after what I said.

15:20.630 --> 15:24.700
Thank you,though,for,um,being the keeper of all my memories.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.670
You're welcome.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.460
It's a little weird,you know? You have so many.

15:29.550 --> 15:31.290
I know,but it's worth it.

15:31.670 --> 15:35.240
- shawn miller certainly thought so.
- Shawn miller?

15:35.790 --> 15:37.680
- The icelander?
- Mum-mmm

15:37.850 --> 15:39.850
He was real?

15:40.010 --> 15:43.320
How do you think I got this picture of your first dance recital?

15:45.920 --> 15:48.880
oh,no.

15:53.030 --> 15:53.850
Hi.

15:54.130 --> 15:55.810
Cheer up,miss newly.

15:56.130 --> 15:57.580
The sun'll come out.

15:58.100 --> 16:00.990
- Guess when?
- Suck it,frank.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.260
So in one day,I destroyed my parents,

16:05.310 --> 16:07.050
got kicked out by my best friend,

16:07.100 --> 16:11.070
made my ex-boyfriend homeless and almost burned down my own apartment.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.250
Oh,yeah.Independence is awesome.

16:22.230 --> 16:24.660
- Oh.
- May I come in? Mm-hmm.

16:28.830 --> 16:32.300
Well,uh,I brought you tta lile something
a little care package from my home to yours.

16:32.350 --> 16:37.630
It's nothing special.Just,um,some decorations and some food,and--

16:37.680 --> 16:39.120
food!

16:43.390 --> 16:47.760
- I'm so sorry about what happened
- You can save what you wanna say until after you've swallowed.

16:47.760 --> 16:50.090
I made the food.I don't need to see it again.

16:50.850 --> 16:52.790
Sorry.

16:54.130 --> 16:57.180
Oh!I brought you something else.

17:05.530 --> 17:07.760
I looked for that for five hours last night.

17:08.180 --> 17:09.750
It was in with your dad's tools,

17:09.859 --> 17:13.050
which means it was special to him
It was special to me,too.

17:15.180 --> 17:17.260
Think is still wet.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.319
So?

17:20.050 --> 17:22.500
Look,I.I don't know what you want from me.

17:22.550 --> 17:25.599
I just wanna know what is true and what is not true

17:25.650 --> 17:27.640
not what you think that I wanna hear.

17:27.690 --> 17:30.840
The truth is,I never wanted you
to go to that hypnotherapist in the first place.

17:30.890 --> 17:33.010
Yeah,I know,because you were looking out for me.

17:33.060 --> 17:37.000
No,'cause I was looking out for me.

17:38.660 --> 17:40.950
I.I wasn't a perfect mother.

17:41.810 --> 17:45.770
I was selfish sometimes,and--and I made mistakes,

17:46.610 --> 17:50.120
and I-I let you down.

17:50.610 --> 17:53.340
And I was afraid that if you remembered who I was,

17:53.390 --> 17:56.990
that you.
wouldn't want me around anymore.

17:58.050 --> 18:00.700
I was annie!

18:01.710 --> 18:04.378
- What?
- I know I wasn't adopted.

18:04.378 --> 18:08.087
I remembered playing "annie".in school.

18:09.270 --> 18:12.420
Oh,that's right.Oh,that's right,you did.

18:12.470 --> 18:15.780
Uh.and not--not your best role.

18:16.100 --> 18:19.830
You don't play "adorable" well.It comes off as snide.

18:20.910 --> 18:22.370
(Sighs) look.

18:22.770 --> 18:27.600
I am so sorry for all those things that I said
I do wanna have a relationship with you.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.990
so I get to be your mother again?

18:31.160 --> 18:34.870
Mm-hmm.You're my mommy.

18:35.820 --> 18:37.200
I need you!

18:37.250 --> 18:38.800
I need help.

18:39.000 --> 18:44.450
I'm very hungry,but I keep starting fires.

18:45.560 --> 18:48.970
poor baby.It's okay.

18:50.040 --> 18:53.780
That's my girl.That's my girl.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.810
That's my girl!That's my girl!

18:58.860 --> 19:00.440
Ooh!You're so naughty.

19:00.590 --> 19:05.160
- I learned it from you,slut!
- Oh,yeah.Oh,yeah.Oh!Peter!

19:05.300 --> 19:09.060
Watch my moneymaker.
Ah,ah-ah,ah-ah,oh.

19:18.140 --> 19:21.530
312-555-0192.

19:21.580 --> 19:23.450
now what are you saying?You're mumbling.

19:23.500 --> 19:24.860
Nothing.Nothing.

19:24.910 --> 19:27.540
- can we please go home?
- Of course.

19:27.950 --> 19:30.110
You always have a home with us.

19:30.940 --> 19:34.130
Oh,n-now when you see your room
you might notice your father's old soloflex.

19:34.180 --> 19:37.160
I'll have him move it back out.Now don't get hysterical.

19:44.100 --> 19:48.320
okay,so maybe I'm not ready to be completely independent just yet.

19:48.370 --> 19:49.970
I mean,I'm trying to catch up on three decades of a life here.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.320
Cut me some slack.

19:51.560 --> 19:54.410
Look,I know I don't have to remember it all right now,

19:54.460 --> 19:58.870
and I guess sometimes
I forget that figuring out who I am is hard on everybody.

19:58.920 --> 20:02.240
We're all trying our best,and we're going to make mistakes.

20:02.240 --> 20:03.850
We have to go easy on each other.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.180
Oh,you know what?Uh,frank,

20:05.230 --> 20:08.640
I called todd and he's--he's coming back,so you can just let him in.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.110
He apologized and everything
and I said,"it's okay.You know,I'm not really actually ready--"

20:11.160 --> 20:12.720
I'm sorry.Can I interrupt?

20:12.870 --> 20:14.230
Yeah.What is it?

20:14.280 --> 20:16.310
I'm sure I'll think of something.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.270
So.how's the hypnotherapy going?

20:22.320 --> 20:25.860
Oh,that was a big bust.Total waste ofanime d money.

20:26.290 --> 20:27.910
Oh,I wouldn't say that.

20:28.050 --> 20:31.550
- How come?
- I noticed you ok the elevator down.

20:31.760 --> 20:32.980
What?

20:45.080 --> 20:47.070
the road to independence takes time,

20:47.240 --> 20:49.930
but no matter where you came from or where you're headed,

20:49.980 --> 20:53.210
the journey's always better when you get to turn to someone and say,

20:53.260 --> 20:54.840
"thanks for being here.

20:54.890 --> 20:59.710
How you can manage to get filthy
walking from a building to a car is absotely amazing.

20:59.760 --> 21:02.120
You get that from your father,not from me.
