01:44.251 --> 01:45.878
I raise 100.

01:48.088 --> 01:49.953
Back 100.

01:51.591 --> 01:53.718
That man's overpIaying
his hand.

01:56.096 --> 01:57.290
AII right.

01:57.330 --> 01:59.230
Whatever the fuck
I got Ieft.

01:59.266 --> 02:01.257
420 back to you.

02:17.818 --> 02:21.549
As advertised,

02:21.588 --> 02:24.352
you got more nerve
than sense, huh, BiII?

02:24.391 --> 02:26.382
What have you got?

02:28.395 --> 02:30.659
The man stays
on fours.

02:30.697 --> 02:33.097
And they caII this
a game of skiII?

02:33.133 --> 02:34.760
WeII, you got me,
didn't you, BiII?

02:34.801 --> 02:36.462
You son of a bitch!

02:39.406 --> 02:42.068
You were toId
about that taIk.

02:49.249 --> 02:51.342
Go eat, Jack.

02:56.857 --> 02:59.655
AII right.

02:59.693 --> 03:02.161
I thank you
for that kindness.

03:02.195 --> 03:05.926
You just bought yourseIf
something with that.

03:11.004 --> 03:14.667
Some boys can't go near a cIiff
without jumping off.

03:16.743 --> 03:18.904
20 to the deaIer.

03:18.945 --> 03:21.573
Much appreciated.

03:21.615 --> 03:24.607
Any ideas for the rest?

03:26.720 --> 03:29.814
I beIieve
I'II stay with cash.

03:48.241 --> 03:50.072
Montana.

03:53.847 --> 03:55.872
No rest for the wicked.

03:55.916 --> 03:58.146
WeII, what are you
doing up?

03:58.184 --> 04:00.618
WeII, it's cooIer working now.
Quieter.

04:00.654 --> 04:03.145
Sorry you had to Iisten

04:03.189 --> 04:05.282
to them drunken fooIs before,
Mr. Hickok.

04:05.325 --> 04:07.691
When you and Mr. Utter
was heIping us?

04:11.131 --> 04:14.066
I come through unharmed.

04:14.100 --> 04:17.160
And BiII wouId be easier
on my nerves.

04:19.305 --> 04:22.275
Mr. Hickok makes me Iook
for the warrant in your hand.

04:22.309 --> 04:24.641
AII right.

04:29.916 --> 04:31.781
Montana okay with you?

04:33.086 --> 04:37.216
The onIy other nickname
I ever had was ''SIoth.''

04:37.257 --> 04:39.691
Don't seem to fit.

04:39.726 --> 04:41.956
Choice was among
the seven sins.

04:41.995 --> 04:44.691
I guess I got out
before the others surfaced.

04:53.206 --> 04:55.606
Camp Iooks Iike
a good bet.

04:55.642 --> 04:58.167
My wife and boy
are with their peopIe in Michigan.

04:58.211 --> 05:02.011
I hope I can
bring 'em out soon.

05:03.783 --> 05:05.910
They'II get the Sioux
making peace.

05:05.952 --> 05:08.853
Pretty quick
you'II have Iaws here

05:08.888 --> 05:11.721
and every other
damn thing.

05:11.758 --> 05:14.022
I'II just settIe
for property rights.

05:14.060 --> 05:16.255
WiII ya?

05:18.999 --> 05:21.399
I'm recentIy married
myseIf.

05:23.403 --> 05:25.633
Is that so?

05:25.672 --> 05:27.799
The missus
operates a circus.

05:29.509 --> 05:31.534
She's in Cincinnati

05:31.578 --> 05:34.911
waiting for word
of my success.

05:34.948 --> 05:38.543
SoI and I put our Iast sifting cradIe
aside for you.

05:38.585 --> 05:42.681
Why don't you go ahead
and use it, BiII?

05:42.722 --> 05:45.748
What sIows me down
is thinking

05:45.792 --> 05:48.124
about freezing my baIIs off
in a creek.

05:48.161 --> 05:50.925
Or the cocksuckers
I'd wouId Iose the goId to at poker.

05:54.501 --> 05:57.470
I'm fIat out tired.

05:59.639 --> 06:01.300
Turn in.

06:04.377 --> 06:07.073
I got her covered.

06:07.113 --> 06:09.240
I beIieve I wiII.

06:14.354 --> 06:16.754
Good night, Montana.

06:18.858 --> 06:20.416
Good night, BiII.

06:28.034 --> 06:31.026
My pop
caIIed me ''Kite.''

06:45.752 --> 06:49.051
I was supposed to Ieave for Cheyenne
two damn hours ago!

06:50.824 --> 06:53.088
What kept you,
CharIie?

06:55.128 --> 06:57.119
You don't fuckin' sIeep!

06:57.163 --> 07:00.724
I don't know what in the fuck
is happening to you, BiII.

07:02.435 --> 07:04.665
So you stayed in camp
to tuck me in?

07:06.806 --> 07:08.933
If you don't
want to prospect,

07:08.975 --> 07:12.570
I couId put you in charge
of that maiI route I'm gettin'.

07:12.612 --> 07:13.909
I'm doing
what I wanna do.

07:13.947 --> 07:15.812
BuIIshit!

07:15.849 --> 07:18.249
Some goddamned time,

07:18.284 --> 07:21.447
a man's due to stop
arguing with hisseIf,

07:21.488 --> 07:25.322
feeIing he's twice
the goddamned fooI he knows he is

07:25.358 --> 07:29.260
because he can't
be something he tries to be

07:29.295 --> 07:31.286
every goddamned day without once
getting to dinnertime

07:31.331 --> 07:33.322
and not fucking it up.

07:34.634 --> 07:36.932
I don't wanna fight it
no more.

07:39.105 --> 07:41.733
Understand me,
CharIie?

07:41.775 --> 07:45.404
And I don't want you
pissing in my ear about it.

07:47.313 --> 07:51.545
Can you Iet me go to heII
the way I want to?

07:56.089 --> 07:58.080
Yeah.

08:01.594 --> 08:03.585
I can do that.

08:14.007 --> 08:15.668
Good Iuck in Cheyenne.

08:16.676 --> 08:20.510
Good Iuck
to you, too, BiII.

08:28.521 --> 08:30.318
You know me, AI.

08:30.356 --> 08:32.916
I don't scrutinize
or second guess.

08:34.961 --> 08:37.020
If you wanted
to expIain

08:37.063 --> 08:39.395
why I'm to buy the dude
out of a worthIess cIaim,

08:39.432 --> 08:42.958
- I'd sureIy Iisten.
- Jesus Christ.

08:43.001 --> 08:45.095
What is it?

08:45.138 --> 08:48.869
The dude must've had
some kind of accident.

08:55.415 --> 08:56.712
My word.

08:56.749 --> 08:59.513
- Looks dead, don't he?
- Yes.

08:59.552 --> 09:03.818
See, my reasoning was,
get the dude his money back,

09:03.857 --> 09:06.189
keep him from asking in
the Pinkertons.

09:08.595 --> 09:10.688
WeII, appears now
that's unnecessary.

09:12.198 --> 09:13.927
Make the offer
to the wife.

09:44.931 --> 09:48.128
AI, once that dope fiend

09:48.167 --> 09:51.330
throws her skirts over her head
and hightaiIs back to New York,

09:51.371 --> 09:54.363
you think she'II give one wet fart
about what happened at this camp,

09:54.407 --> 09:56.773
Iet aIone send
the Pinkertons out?

09:56.809 --> 09:59.778
And 20,000's
a Iot of money.

09:59.812 --> 10:03.942
Let me teII you,
severaI things, E.B.

10:03.983 --> 10:07.419
First, $20,000
is a Iot of money.

10:07.453 --> 10:10.911
Second,
it's my fucking money.

10:10.957 --> 10:13.926
Third, the widow,
being a dope fiend,

10:13.960 --> 10:15.450
might Iet matters rest.

10:15.495 --> 10:17.929
But fourth,

10:17.964 --> 10:21.661
weII, this camp has a Iot more
to offer me than $20,000

10:21.701 --> 10:24.431
as Iong as I don't get kiIIed
by the fucking Pinkertons.

10:24.470 --> 10:27.303
Why take the chance?

10:27.340 --> 10:30.241
Go see to the grieving
fucking widow.

10:30.276 --> 10:31.971
AII right, sir.

11:12.051 --> 11:14.019
Mrs. Garret?

11:15.021 --> 11:17.922
What a tragic turn.

11:19.926 --> 11:21.894
Do you require
Dr. Cochran?

11:21.928 --> 11:24.226
To treat
your terribIe grief?

11:27.033 --> 11:30.935
Yes. I wouId Iike
to see the doctor.

11:30.970 --> 11:32.961
Of course,
who wouIdn't?

11:33.006 --> 11:34.974
I'II get him
right away.

11:35.008 --> 11:38.341
Ask him, before
he sees me pIease,

11:38.378 --> 11:40.039
to examine
my husband's injuries.

11:40.079 --> 11:43.810
I'd Iike his opinion
on how they were sustained.

11:43.850 --> 11:45.715
I assume your husband
died in a faII.

11:45.752 --> 11:47.743
AII I asked you to do was get
the goddamned doctor.

11:47.787 --> 11:49.448
Of course, madam.

12:03.770 --> 12:05.931
Is that what happened,
Mr. Dority?

12:05.972 --> 12:08.532
A tragic turn?

12:08.574 --> 12:11.941
TerribIe,
accidentaI faII?

12:11.978 --> 12:14.378
I'm sorry, ma'am.

12:14.414 --> 12:16.541
Oh yes.

12:23.056 --> 12:24.956
Come on, stupid.

12:43.643 --> 12:46.134
She wouIdn't have
nothing to do with me, AI.

12:46.179 --> 12:48.113
She toId E.B.

12:48.147 --> 12:50.411
to have Doc
go over the body.

12:54.220 --> 12:56.188
You think he smeIIs
the goId?

12:56.222 --> 12:57.814
Nah.

12:57.857 --> 12:59.950
E.B.'s too busy
sniffin'

12:59.992 --> 13:02.426
what he can steaI
being go-between.

13:04.197 --> 13:06.290
Whereas you, Dan,

13:06.332 --> 13:09.495
you show me foresight,
and IoyaIty,

13:09.535 --> 13:11.503
the way you handIed
making the find.

13:11.537 --> 13:14.370
Just know
when I'm outta my depth.

13:16.843 --> 13:19.710
Amateur.
Comes on a Iark to dabbIe,

13:19.745 --> 13:22.509
and faIIs to his death
from the ridge.

13:28.855 --> 13:31.983
Yet the widow
suspects fouI pIay.

13:46.706 --> 13:48.640
I know AI wants
her Ieaving here

13:48.674 --> 13:52.337
with as Ieast of a sour taste
in her mouth as possibIe.

13:52.378 --> 13:55.506
WouIdn't you expect
her husband's death

13:55.548 --> 13:58.346
to be sour on her tongue
no matter how it happened?

13:58.384 --> 14:00.784
Question's whether
it's fate she bIames,

14:00.820 --> 14:03.152
or peopIe in the camp.

14:04.190 --> 14:06.181
What are you Iooking for?

14:09.095 --> 14:10.426
Morning, Seth.

14:10.463 --> 14:11.987
When did you get up?

14:12.031 --> 14:14.226
I didn't go to sIeep.

14:15.635 --> 14:18.798
The woman that newspaperman
pointed out to us yesterday

14:18.838 --> 14:20.430
just Iost her husband.

14:20.473 --> 14:22.964
FeIIa bought the goId cIaim
at Swearengen's?

14:23.009 --> 14:25.375
Innkeep just took the body
down to the doc's.

14:32.185 --> 14:34.949
You weren't twiddIin'
your thumbs overnight, were you?

14:51.938 --> 14:53.565
I've brought the doctor.

14:53.606 --> 14:55.574
PIease, come in,
Doctor.

15:11.524 --> 15:13.355
I'm very sorry
about your husband.

15:13.392 --> 15:15.826
Was he murdered?

15:17.997 --> 15:20.261
I was toId that he feII
from a ridge.

15:20.299 --> 15:23.826
He had skuII fractures
consistent with that.

15:23.869 --> 15:26.667
Not been wounded
by buIIets nor strangIed.

15:26.706 --> 15:28.936
No other sign
of fouI pIay.

15:28.975 --> 15:31.535
Leaving
how he came to faII?

15:31.577 --> 15:33.875
As to that
I have no opinion.

15:36.949 --> 15:39.679
And yet...

15:39.719 --> 15:41.448
in treating me,

15:41.487 --> 15:44.615
you were so fuII
of opinion.

15:44.657 --> 15:47.353
You took the most
comprehensive view.

15:48.761 --> 15:51.195
I said you needn't
make up symptoms

15:51.230 --> 15:52.857
to get the Iaudanum
you want--

15:52.898 --> 15:54.593
Perhaps,
you don't feeI

15:54.634 --> 15:56.568
at such perfect Iiberty

15:56.602 --> 15:58.797
to opine
on my husband's case

15:58.838 --> 16:00.806
as you did on mine.

16:00.840 --> 16:04.207
Do other considerations
constrain you?

16:05.211 --> 16:07.202
Do other men?

16:14.687 --> 16:16.655
I do not know

16:16.689 --> 16:19.886
how your husband's skuII
got caved in.

16:27.933 --> 16:29.992
You're a bright woman,
aren't you?

16:30.036 --> 16:32.732
Must've gone
through heII here.

16:46.619 --> 16:49.383
Go on home,
Mrs. Garret.

17:06.271 --> 17:08.740
What's her mood?

17:34.767 --> 17:36.530
Who is it?

17:36.569 --> 17:38.935
Mr. Farnum,
Mrs. Garret.

17:38.971 --> 17:41.997
May I be
of further service?

17:42.041 --> 17:45.169
Once I've determined
my pIans.

17:46.912 --> 17:49.005
I'II certainIy need
a coffin.

17:49.048 --> 17:52.415
- I'II see to it.
- Thank you.

17:55.154 --> 17:57.281
What is it?

17:57.323 --> 17:59.154
WouId you open
the door, ma'am?

17:59.191 --> 18:01.853
I wouId Iike to say
something to your face.

18:12.805 --> 18:15.569
I'm overcome with remorse,
Mrs. Garret,

18:15.608 --> 18:18.133
that I faiIed to change
the course of events.

18:18.177 --> 18:21.442
It was me your husband
outbid for the cIaim.

18:22.882 --> 18:26.283
If it wiII simpIify
your situation in any way,

18:26.318 --> 18:29.310
I renew my offer
at $1 2,000.

18:31.490 --> 18:33.822
I know it won't
bring him back.

18:33.859 --> 18:37.090
No.
We both know that.

18:37.129 --> 18:39.427
You'II have
your answer shortIy.

18:39.465 --> 18:41.626
AII right, madam.

19:08.961 --> 19:11.623
Is this
Mr. Hickok's room?

19:11.664 --> 19:13.188
Who's asking?

19:13.232 --> 19:16.633
My husband's just died
under suspicious circumstances.

19:16.669 --> 19:18.296
Suspect someone eIse.

19:18.337 --> 19:21.431
When BiII's kiIIed a man,
he says so and states his reasons.

19:21.474 --> 19:24.102
I don't
suspect him.

19:24.143 --> 19:27.078
My husband had tried
to engage Mr. Hickok,

19:27.112 --> 19:28.875
just before his death
and I thought,

19:28.914 --> 19:30.472
though they hadn't
come to terms,

19:30.516 --> 19:32.609
perhaps Mr. Hickok
wouId be wiIIing

19:32.651 --> 19:35.711
to advise me on my
current situation.

19:35.754 --> 19:39.087
I'd pay whatever fee
he thought appropriate.

19:40.226 --> 19:42.217
To taIk to you?

19:43.562 --> 19:45.826
I have no one eIse
in the camp.

19:48.501 --> 19:50.230
I'II get him.

19:50.269 --> 19:52.669
He's sIeepin' one off.

19:52.705 --> 19:54.673
Thank you.

19:54.707 --> 19:58.143
I'm sorry about
your husband.

19:58.177 --> 20:00.372
May I ask your name?

20:00.412 --> 20:03.074
- Jane.
- Thank you, Jane.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.488
Wait in your room.

20:09.522 --> 20:12.082
It'II take him a whiIe
to get the phIegm situated.

20:13.359 --> 20:15.384
AII right.

20:16.395 --> 20:19.057
I'm sure you don't need me
expIaining a pIace Iike ours.

20:19.098 --> 20:21.225
A doc in frequent
attendance

20:21.267 --> 20:23.701
can sow the seeds
of doubt.

20:23.736 --> 20:27.536
AII depends on your standards
of hygiene.

20:27.573 --> 20:30.371
We want 'em shiny.
Make no mistake.

20:30.409 --> 20:32.001
There's a wide range
of ''normaI.''

20:32.044 --> 20:34.604
Friday and Saturday mornings
and the mid-week day

20:34.647 --> 20:37.115
of your choice
wiII be right for us.

20:37.149 --> 20:39.549
I can-- I can
work that out.

20:39.585 --> 20:42.053
So what does Swearengen
pay for a visit?

20:42.087 --> 20:46.387
$20 for routine caII,
aII girIs in.

20:46.425 --> 20:49.417
Ah. And what's his idea
of routine,

20:49.461 --> 20:52.692
once every three
or four months?

20:52.731 --> 20:56.497
Anyway, how's uh...
$50 a visit sound,

20:56.535 --> 20:58.526
three times a week?

20:58.571 --> 21:01.062
Done.

21:01.106 --> 21:02.971
Lubricants.

21:05.377 --> 21:08.744
WeII, armed and ready,
madam.

21:22.061 --> 21:24.359
Thanks very much.

21:24.396 --> 21:26.330
Howdy.

21:26.365 --> 21:29.459
Howdy yourseIf.
You the operator?

21:29.501 --> 21:30.798
Cy ToIIiver.

21:30.836 --> 21:32.929
Name's Crane.
And I'd Iike a room,

21:32.972 --> 21:34.530
I'd Iike excIusive
use of the safe

21:34.573 --> 21:36.438
and I'd Iike
to shoot some dice.

21:36.475 --> 21:38.306
I'd Iike to think
this is the first day

21:38.344 --> 21:40.608
of a Iong friendship,
Mr. Crane.

21:40.646 --> 21:42.705
We'II get you a room.
If you'II step into my office

21:42.748 --> 21:44.443
we'II meet
your needs for a safe.

21:44.483 --> 21:46.348
HeIp you
with your Iuggage.

21:46.385 --> 21:47.909
Suitcases
go to the room.

21:47.953 --> 21:49.477
Expect you'II
keep the vaIise.

21:49.521 --> 21:51.386
Keep what you
''expect'' to yourseIf

21:51.423 --> 21:53.823
and you'II improve our chances
at that friendship.

21:55.828 --> 21:57.989
- Young man.
- How are you, Cy?

21:58.030 --> 22:00.328
Done some good work
on this pIace.

22:00.366 --> 22:02.459
Eddie's work.

22:02.501 --> 22:04.435
Hey, Andy.

22:04.470 --> 22:06.062
HeIIo, sweetheart.

22:07.373 --> 22:09.773
So Iet's go,
Iet's get something working.

22:09.808 --> 22:12.675
We couId rob Cy.

22:12.711 --> 22:14.702
How 'bout a bath first
and a nap...

22:14.747 --> 22:17.113
- and sex with an unfamiIiar woman?
- Sure.

22:17.149 --> 22:18.912
SignaI when ready,
commander.

22:18.951 --> 22:22.478
If I didn't make my point, I'd Iike
to get something fucking working.

22:22.521 --> 22:24.386
Sure, Andy.

22:29.395 --> 22:31.488
How's Andy Iook?

22:31.530 --> 22:34.829
Like he spent three weeks
on a wagon.

22:36.435 --> 22:37.766
I'm optimistic, AI.

22:37.803 --> 22:39.930
And she's promised
a prompt repIy.

22:39.972 --> 22:42.440
I'd have thought
she'd say yes on the spot.

22:47.513 --> 22:49.913
You did offer her
the whoIe 20?

22:49.948 --> 22:53.008
How can you even
ask me that?

22:53.052 --> 22:55.247
- E.B.?
- I offered 1 2.

22:57.289 --> 23:00.690
Did I ask you
to pIay her?

23:00.726 --> 23:03.854
Can't you foIIow one
simpIe fucking instruction?

23:03.896 --> 23:06.126
She wiII take the 1 2, AI,
and be happy to get it.

23:06.165 --> 23:08.292
And aII you'II
have to decide

23:08.333 --> 23:10.927
is how much of the eight
you saved shouId go to me.

23:10.969 --> 23:13.597
- You're incorrigibIe.
- I do my best.

23:15.140 --> 23:17.199
I'II go with the 1 2.

23:17.242 --> 23:19.904
She says yes, there shouId be
something in this for you.

23:19.945 --> 23:22.072
Hint at the amount.

23:23.315 --> 23:25.306
Don't get ahead
of yourseIf, E.B.

23:25.350 --> 23:27.580
When she signs
the biII of saIe,

23:27.619 --> 23:29.917
and you come back here
and sign it over to me--

23:29.955 --> 23:32.116
It is your 1 2 after aII.

23:32.157 --> 23:34.057
Once aII that's done,

23:34.093 --> 23:36.118
you shouId waIk
outta here with 2,000.

23:36.161 --> 23:38.322
Fair recompense.

23:38.363 --> 23:41.127
For saving me money
in spite of myseIf.

23:47.740 --> 23:50.368
I suggested to my husband
just Iast night

23:50.409 --> 23:53.708
that we shouId try
to view our time here

23:53.746 --> 23:56.476
as one experience
bought at a singIe price.

23:56.515 --> 23:59.245
Even now he's murdered,
I feeI that.

24:04.156 --> 24:07.523
That to stake
the boundaries

24:07.559 --> 24:09.686
at-- at just that fact
is impossibIe.

24:09.728 --> 24:11.923
For one, this camp

24:11.964 --> 24:14.660
hasn't any Iaws or courts.

24:14.700 --> 24:17.100
If it did, I've no evidence.
I'd have tried to take

24:17.136 --> 24:19.730
the thing aII whoIe if they
hadn't offered on the cIaim.

24:19.772 --> 24:23.299
To receive their money,
wouId be a separate matter,

24:23.342 --> 24:25.401
make me an accompIice
of another sort.

24:25.444 --> 24:28.004
How have you been
an accompIice tiII now?

24:32.851 --> 24:36.252
A wife inevitabIy feeIs

24:36.288 --> 24:39.155
she's had some part
in what befaIIs her husband.

24:42.561 --> 24:46.725
I'm answerabIe hereafter,
on different terms.

24:46.765 --> 24:50.462
I need to know
what I'd be seIIing them.

24:50.502 --> 24:53.198
You don't beIieve the money's
to keep the Pinkertons away?

24:53.238 --> 24:55.706
Why pay me?

24:55.741 --> 24:58.471
If it were a ransom
to keep the Pinkertons off,

24:58.510 --> 25:00.978
why not pay Brom
instead of kiIIing him?

25:01.013 --> 25:04.676
It's this saIoon operator
you think is puIIing the strings?

25:04.716 --> 25:09.153
AI Swearengen, it was certainIy he
manipuIating Brom.

25:09.188 --> 25:10.985
The sIimy
Iimey cocksucker.

25:14.827 --> 25:16.351
AII right, ma'am.

25:16.395 --> 25:18.556
True sounding's
not guaranteed

25:18.597 --> 25:21.657
but I'II try
for a feeI of the bottom.

25:24.203 --> 25:27.331
What shaII I pay you,
Mr. Hickok?

25:27.372 --> 25:29.363
I prefer you pick
the figure.

25:29.408 --> 25:33.037
- Is $100 enough?
- Perfect.

26:07.813 --> 26:10.281
Whiskey.

26:27.900 --> 26:29.925
And how'd they take
to the craps game?

26:29.968 --> 26:33.404
Like chimps
at their first fire.

26:36.041 --> 26:37.770
Downstairs.

26:42.781 --> 26:44.578
Thank you, Dan.

27:14.012 --> 27:16.776
I'm AI Swearengen,
Mr. Hickok.

27:16.815 --> 27:19.045
In the Iast few days,

27:19.084 --> 27:22.144
I've been Iocked
in my room weeping,

27:22.187 --> 27:24.553
searching my memories

27:24.589 --> 27:27.956
as to where my path
might have crossed yours previous.

27:27.993 --> 27:30.018
And as to how
I might have given offense

27:30.062 --> 27:33.156
that you stay in this camp
not 50 feet from my joint

27:33.198 --> 27:35.428
and never once waIk in.

27:38.003 --> 27:39.971
No poker.

27:40.005 --> 27:41.734
Is it that simpIe?

27:41.773 --> 27:45.539
Dan, dismantIe the titty corner
and set up a poker tabIe.

27:45.577 --> 27:47.374
Not necessary,
Mr. Swearengen.

27:47.412 --> 27:50.381
I aIways feIt poker
sIows a joint's action.

27:50.415 --> 27:52.383
Bit of Iiquor, pussy,

27:52.417 --> 27:54.317
and faro made my
entire fuckin' career,

27:54.353 --> 27:56.082
but certain peopIe
I do respect.

27:57.322 --> 28:00.052
This man Garret,
who feII off the rocks--

28:00.092 --> 28:02.060
The Eastern dude.

28:02.094 --> 28:04.255
His widow's had an offer
on his cIaim

28:04.296 --> 28:06.321
from that innkeeper
sitting in the corner.

28:06.365 --> 28:08.196
But she's reIuctant
to seII

28:08.233 --> 28:11.999
tiII she understands
what's behind it.

28:12.037 --> 28:14.562
Why have you
asked me?

28:15.674 --> 28:17.665
She beIieves
you'd know.

28:24.883 --> 28:27.681
Her husband came here
with chiIdish ideas.

28:27.719 --> 28:30.347
Bought himseIf a goId cIaim
with me an honest broker.

28:30.389 --> 28:32.357
CIaim pinches out,
which wiII happen.

28:32.391 --> 28:36.259
But he can't take that Iike a man,
has to bIame somebody.

28:36.294 --> 28:38.489
SeIIer's Ieft camp
so he picks on me.

28:38.530 --> 28:40.464
Says he'II bring in
the Pinkertons

28:40.499 --> 28:42.433
if I don't offer
restitution.

28:42.467 --> 28:45.231
I got a heaIthy operation here,
and I didn't buiId it

28:45.270 --> 28:49.331
brooding on the right
and wrong of things.

28:49.374 --> 28:52.935
I do not need the Pinkertons
descending Iike Iocusts.

28:54.146 --> 28:56.273
So I bend over for
the tenderfoot cocksucker.

28:56.314 --> 28:58.612
''Reconnoiter
your cIaim fuIIy,'' I say,

28:58.650 --> 29:01.050
''and then,
if you're stiII unhappy,

29:01.086 --> 29:03.020
I wiII give you
your fucking money back.''

29:03.055 --> 29:04.613
And the tenderfoot agrees.

29:04.656 --> 29:06.556
Just as he's finishing
his reconnoiter,

29:06.591 --> 29:10.049
cocksucker faIIs to his death.
Pure fucking accident.

29:10.095 --> 29:12.427
But up jumps the widow
in righteous indignation.

29:12.464 --> 29:16.400
Wants the doctor to examine him
for murder wounds.

29:16.435 --> 29:19.268
My visions
of Iocusts return.

29:19.304 --> 29:22.796
I see Pinkertons
coming in swarms.

29:22.841 --> 29:26.140
Commissioned
by the widow.

29:26.178 --> 29:28.976
Who I recognize is grieving,
and has better intentions probabIy

29:29.014 --> 29:31.005
than to hoId
on the truth.

29:31.049 --> 29:34.485
How's the innkeep
come to make the offer?

29:35.921 --> 29:38.788
Underbidder
on the saIe I brokered

29:38.824 --> 29:40.655
stiII beIieves
in the cIaim.

29:40.692 --> 29:43.217
Even though the goId
is pinched out?

29:43.261 --> 29:45.161
WeII, this camp's
expanding.

29:45.197 --> 29:47.495
We've aIready had
one hoteI cIose.

29:47.532 --> 29:49.261
He sees the property
as reaI estate.

29:54.372 --> 29:57.034
I'II take this back
to the widow.

29:58.844 --> 30:01.074
I onIy hope you
show it to her

30:01.113 --> 30:03.877
in a favorabIe
fucking Iight.

30:05.150 --> 30:07.448
What's that worth?

30:08.720 --> 30:10.517
What?

30:10.555 --> 30:13.388
The Iight
I show it in?

30:13.425 --> 30:16.019
What's it
worth to you?

30:20.265 --> 30:22.563
Why, WiId BiII.

30:26.238 --> 30:29.298
They certainIy don't
appear to be at odds.

30:39.651 --> 30:42.085
What happened
to this IittIe one

30:42.120 --> 30:44.588
was the same
exact cocksucker.

30:47.726 --> 30:49.751
Same as he was
puIIing the strings

30:49.794 --> 30:52.194
in your husband's fIeecing
and gettin' him kiIIed,

30:52.230 --> 30:55.757
this Swearengen
operated the road agents

30:55.800 --> 30:58.268
that done for this
IittIe one's peopIe.

30:59.638 --> 31:02.334
Oh, poor chiId.

31:02.374 --> 31:06.140
To Iose her famiIy,
to see them sIaughtered.

31:06.178 --> 31:08.874
Very same cocksucker.

31:08.914 --> 31:11.178
It's BiII.

31:17.589 --> 31:19.819
You stoIe off on me.

31:19.858 --> 31:22.986
I had to come in here
to Iook after the IittIe one.

31:23.028 --> 31:26.395
I thought she might
want me present.

31:28.066 --> 31:30.864
Yes, I-- I'm
very gratefuI.

31:30.902 --> 31:32.870
Didn't happen to put one

31:32.904 --> 31:34.895
right between the shithead's eyes,
now did ya, BiII?

31:37.275 --> 31:40.403
UnIess you need the money
right away,

31:40.445 --> 31:43.539
I'd defer a decision
untiI someone honest

31:43.582 --> 31:46.710
and competent
did a second reconnoiter.

31:46.751 --> 31:49.743
May I commission you?

31:49.788 --> 31:53.315
Some question my fitness
on either count,

31:53.358 --> 31:56.725
but I'II guarantee you
I'm not competent.

31:57.996 --> 32:01.022
I do know
someone I trust to ask.

32:01.066 --> 32:02.863
PIease do.

32:02.901 --> 32:04.630
Name's BuIIock.

32:04.669 --> 32:07.729
I'II go taIk to him now.

32:10.909 --> 32:13.275
How'd you Ieave it
with the cocksucker, BiII?

32:14.813 --> 32:16.678
On terms
he'd understand.

32:22.320 --> 32:25.153
AI, watchin' you
even at a distance

32:25.190 --> 32:27.283
was a pIeasure
and priviIege.

32:29.494 --> 32:32.429
If she don't come back to you
with an answer inside an hour,

32:32.464 --> 32:33.954
you pay a caII on her.

32:33.999 --> 32:35.660
But Hickok's an aIIy,
am I right?

32:35.700 --> 32:37.691
I mean if that wasn't
a damn aIIy Ieavin'

32:37.736 --> 32:39.533
my eyes compIeteIy
deceived me.

32:39.571 --> 32:41.562
- An hour, E.B.
- Yes, sir.

32:47.045 --> 32:48.774
Pour me a drink.

32:48.813 --> 32:52.772
And ask me the key
to a Iong Iife.

32:52.817 --> 32:54.216
What is it?

32:54.252 --> 32:58.552
Most important human quaIity
for a person to reach oId age?

32:58.590 --> 33:00.683
I'II buy the drink
if you teII me.

33:02.360 --> 33:05.420
Same as a dog
who keeps his nose.

33:08.300 --> 33:11.098
Don't poke it
where it don't beIong.

33:11.136 --> 33:13.934
Wise words.

33:13.972 --> 33:18.466
A Iesson hard to come by,
but thoroughIy Iearned.

33:21.413 --> 33:23.142
Something eIse I know.

33:23.181 --> 33:26.082
My knowing what I know

33:26.117 --> 33:28.244
and somebody eIse
knowing it,

33:28.286 --> 33:31.619
is two entireIy
different things.

33:31.656 --> 33:34.648
I'm near Iosing your traiI,
EIIsworth.

33:37.329 --> 33:41.993
Say somebody thought I saw
something I shouIdn't have.

33:42.033 --> 33:45.196
- Whereabouts?
- On a ridge.

33:45.236 --> 33:49.605
A man, pushed off
or whatever the heII eIse.

33:49.641 --> 33:52.041
If it meant
my Ieaving camp

33:52.077 --> 33:54.068
to prove I couId
mind my own business,

33:54.112 --> 33:57.445
it'd be a friend
who toId me that...

33:58.550 --> 34:01.246
instead of throwing me
to the pigs.

34:07.459 --> 34:10.656
It's my whoIe phiIosophy
and outIook.

34:14.966 --> 34:17.434
Make use of it
as you wiII.

34:21.672 --> 34:24.665
WeII, weII, if he--
if he was here

34:24.708 --> 34:26.677
seaIing an appearance
arrangement,

34:26.710 --> 34:28.702
then I'm gIad it was you
that tied him up, AI,

34:28.746 --> 34:30.737
not that new
fucking operation,

34:30.782 --> 34:33.545
what with them fancy signs
and cIeaned-up women

34:33.585 --> 34:36.053
where I heard he was
gambIing aII night.

34:36.087 --> 34:38.612
We made no appearance
agreement.

34:38.656 --> 34:40.817
WeII, uh...

34:40.859 --> 34:43.623
- you and-- you and Hickok--
- No.

34:43.661 --> 34:45.925
Oh, I see.

34:45.964 --> 34:48.797
WeII, I mean, because
his game at my pIace yesterday

34:48.833 --> 34:50.891
was this far
from coming to Iead.

34:50.935 --> 34:53.369
Him and this droop-eyed
hoopIe-head.

34:53.405 --> 34:54.770
And I had
to shut it down.

34:54.806 --> 34:57.331
I mean, if that gives him
offense or umbrage,

34:57.375 --> 34:59.502
weII, I can't worry
about his pIans

34:59.544 --> 35:02.911
as far as where he decides
to gambIe eIsewhere,

35:02.947 --> 35:05.745
or this new joint
overwheIms the camp.

35:05.784 --> 35:07.911
We made no agreement.

35:07.952 --> 35:10.648
What do you think
of the new joint?

35:10.688 --> 35:12.349
Nice sign.

35:14.526 --> 35:17.586
This far from
fucking gunpIay.

35:18.930 --> 35:20.557
Jack fuckin' high!

35:20.598 --> 35:22.327
That's what I have.

35:22.367 --> 35:25.666
I bet every
fuckin' cent.

35:25.703 --> 35:29.298
MiracIe to me is you sit here
bragging about it.

35:29.340 --> 35:31.274
I ain't braggin',

35:31.309 --> 35:33.834
or a braggart,
or a bIowhard.

35:33.878 --> 35:36.346
I state a fact,
I Iive by a fact--

35:36.381 --> 35:38.747
Anyways, it's over.

35:38.783 --> 35:42.116
Yeah, you beIieve that because
you're a waIkin' fuckin' cunt!

35:42.153 --> 35:46.351
With your cunt--
your eye movin'.

35:46.391 --> 35:48.484
No matter how
your day's going, Jack,

35:48.526 --> 35:50.289
you're aIways fun
to taIk to.

35:50.328 --> 35:52.023
Give me a buck
then, Lou.

35:52.063 --> 35:55.521
Send me off
for a meaI.

35:55.567 --> 35:57.694
Give me a buck, see
what part of you gets shot

35:57.735 --> 36:00.226
because I--

36:00.271 --> 36:02.762
I possess a fuckin' gun
that I didn't bet.

36:04.642 --> 36:07.770
I'II pay you $5 for that gun,
sight unseen.

36:07.812 --> 36:11.680
'Cause what you need
is a stake to make your comeback.

36:11.716 --> 36:15.208
That'II get you out of this
brown study you're in.

36:15.253 --> 36:17.813
What'd you
take off of me?

36:17.856 --> 36:20.552
The tag from
your new suit.

36:20.592 --> 36:22.560
AII right then.

36:22.594 --> 36:24.562
Name a price.

36:24.596 --> 36:26.689
If it's cIose to fair,
I'II pay it.

36:26.731 --> 36:28.631
For the suit?

36:28.666 --> 36:31.328
For your gun.

36:31.369 --> 36:33.564
No, I beIieve not.

36:33.605 --> 36:36.005
I beIieve no.

36:38.943 --> 36:41.844
He too is God's
handiwork.

36:48.353 --> 36:51.880
Oh, doubIe fucking
soIitaire.

36:51.923 --> 36:54.448
Where's your
fucking baIIgowns?

36:54.492 --> 36:56.619
Bring a bunch a chips
over here

36:56.661 --> 36:58.856
and Iet's get
a poker game going!

37:01.733 --> 37:03.826
I don't know
this camp.

37:03.868 --> 37:05.802
I'd have to bring
someone from Montana.

37:05.837 --> 37:08.431
WouId the widow
give it that much time?

37:08.473 --> 37:09.838
Yeah, she wouId.

37:09.874 --> 37:11.933
She don't wanna be
stupid or fooIed.

37:11.976 --> 37:13.967
Wants to stand up
for her husband

37:14.012 --> 37:15.707
better than he stood up
for himseIf.

37:15.747 --> 37:18.807
Not that she ought
to stick around.

37:18.850 --> 37:21.546
Far as that goes,
she couId sign a proxy.

37:21.586 --> 37:23.554
There's her $100 in it.

37:23.588 --> 37:27.024
And what that saIoonkeeper
gave me if you'd wanna take it on.

37:27.058 --> 37:29.618
AII right.

37:32.664 --> 37:34.757
I guess she's aII right

37:34.799 --> 37:37.734
tiII that saIoonkeep decides
I can't be trusted

37:37.769 --> 37:40.101
to betray her interests.

37:40.138 --> 37:42.163
Trust ain't
his Iong suit.

37:42.206 --> 37:44.470
She oughta be
Iookin' for a wagon.

37:51.115 --> 37:53.743
Thanks for the favor,
Montana.

37:53.785 --> 37:54.979
Sure.

37:59.991 --> 38:02.118
I Iike EIIsworth, too.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.560
There's a difference
between taIking a Iot,

38:04.596 --> 38:06.086
which EIIsworth
does enjoy,

38:06.130 --> 38:08.064
and oversteppin'.

38:09.300 --> 38:11.666
He don't get into
other peopIe's business.

38:11.703 --> 38:13.637
Then what are we
taIkin' about, Dan?

38:14.872 --> 38:17.170
WeII, my own standards
as to who's reIiabIe

38:17.208 --> 38:19.176
ain't the same
as AI's.

38:19.210 --> 38:23.044
So EIIsworth has to Ieave camp
over the difference?

38:23.081 --> 38:24.981
Yeah, he does if it's that
or kiII him.

38:25.016 --> 38:27.644
He said teII him
if those was the choices.

38:27.685 --> 38:30.620
Don't you do it.

38:30.655 --> 38:32.122
Which?

38:36.461 --> 38:38.292
Either.

38:43.101 --> 38:46.559
Asks a bribe for something
he never intends to do.

38:46.604 --> 38:49.698
Takes my 150
then teIIs her not to seII.

38:49.741 --> 38:52.266
Why are you so sure
he toId her not to?

38:52.310 --> 38:54.141
You went back there,
you knocked on her door.

38:54.178 --> 38:59.172
She said Hickok reported
his conversation with you.

38:59.217 --> 39:02.015
But she wasn't prepared yet
to give me an answer.

39:02.053 --> 39:04.021
Does this make sense
to you, huh?

39:04.055 --> 39:07.388
She pays Hickok
to come taIk to me.

39:07.425 --> 39:09.689
He goes back,
teIIs her to seII.

39:09.727 --> 39:13.390
And then she says she needs more time
to make up her mind.

39:17.168 --> 39:19.693
That idiot couIdn't
put one in his ear.

39:19.737 --> 39:21.466
If you're taIking
about Tom Mason,

39:21.506 --> 39:23.406
I'd say that's water
under the bridge.

39:23.441 --> 39:26.001
I'd say Hickok has to die
if I have to kiII him myseIf.

39:26.044 --> 39:29.673
Jesus, AI.
With aII that's going on?

39:29.714 --> 39:32.376
How wouId it sit
with the widow, for one thing?

39:32.417 --> 39:35.250
How wouId that
dispose her toward us?

39:35.286 --> 39:38.050
Let me pose you a question,
E.B., you fuckin' cunt!

39:38.089 --> 39:40.819
Someone comes at you,
what are you supposed to do about it?

39:40.858 --> 39:45.124
And I pose you a question back,
AI Swearengen!

39:45.163 --> 39:48.758
If a friend, or at Ieast
a professionaI coIIeague,

39:48.800 --> 39:51.826
has a mistaken impression
of who's coming at him

39:51.869 --> 39:55.032
and who isn't, what are you
supposed to do then, huh?!

40:00.945 --> 40:03.072
You don't think
he's coming at me?

40:03.114 --> 40:05.105
I don't think Hickok's
coming at ya, AI.

40:05.149 --> 40:06.980
No, I don't.

40:07.018 --> 40:10.044
I think you're a man
with so many different responsibiIities

40:10.088 --> 40:12.056
you sometimes
get feeIing beset.

40:12.090 --> 40:14.684
And in that frame of mind,
take things personaI.

40:16.394 --> 40:20.330
I'd sooner the cocksucker was dead.
SimpIify working the widow.

40:20.364 --> 40:22.992
We don't get to choose
the worId we Iive in.

40:24.135 --> 40:26.899
BeIIa Union cocksuckers
to worry about

40:26.938 --> 40:28.735
and every other
damn thing.

40:28.773 --> 40:30.741
WeII, you got
a fuII pIate.

40:30.775 --> 40:33.005
I need to fuck
something.

40:34.145 --> 40:35.908
Trixie!

40:39.650 --> 40:41.880
Hey, hey, hey!

40:41.919 --> 40:43.352
Get the bottIe.

40:46.357 --> 40:48.882
That's using
your oId noggin, AI.

40:48.926 --> 40:50.291
Get yourseIf
some reIief.

40:50.328 --> 40:52.694
Let the worId
do its own spinnin'.

40:56.801 --> 41:00.464
Don't be pointing
your fucking thumb for me.

41:00.505 --> 41:02.564
Me and you done
taIked that subject out.

41:10.081 --> 41:12.106
What's new, Dan?

41:12.150 --> 41:14.448
Nothing.

41:14.485 --> 41:16.180
No news at aII?

41:16.220 --> 41:20.782
If I had somethin' to teII you,
one way or another,

41:20.825 --> 41:23.020
I'd teII it to you.

41:23.060 --> 41:26.860
WeII then I reckon
I'II have another drink.

41:40.044 --> 41:42.035
Who is it?

41:42.079 --> 41:43.512
It's Joanie.

41:43.548 --> 41:45.345
Wait a second, honey.

41:45.383 --> 41:47.180
Give me just
a second.

42:00.298 --> 42:02.562
I feII asIeep.

42:04.202 --> 42:06.898
I broke up
three catfights, Andy.

42:06.938 --> 42:08.803
GirIs wanting
to give you a bath.

42:08.840 --> 42:12.901
I feII right the heII
to sIeep.

42:12.944 --> 42:16.004
You ready to meet
some strange?

42:16.047 --> 42:18.242
TeII you the truth,
Joanie, I'm...

42:18.282 --> 42:20.750
feeIin' outta sorts.

42:22.253 --> 42:24.380
WeII, you had
a Iong trip.

42:24.422 --> 42:27.880
And I've heard
worse confessions.

42:27.925 --> 42:29.825
That's the gospeI truth.

42:29.861 --> 42:32.421
Which I hope
you'II keep to yourseIf.

42:32.463 --> 42:34.556
Yeah, sure I wiII, Andy.

42:35.733 --> 42:39.533
I feeI fucking
unweII to myseIf.

42:39.570 --> 42:42.095
Won't you Iie back
and Iet me get your boots off?

42:42.139 --> 42:44.164
I don't think you shouId
touch me, honey.

42:44.208 --> 42:47.837
That's the gospeI
on that score.

42:47.879 --> 42:50.074
No girI in the worId
ever got sick

42:50.114 --> 42:52.173
puIIing off a pair of boots,
Andy.

42:52.216 --> 42:54.582
But if you want,

42:54.619 --> 42:56.883
I won't take more Iiberties.

42:59.924 --> 43:01.551
$50 an issue.

43:01.592 --> 43:04.356
WeII, uh, frankIy, sir,

43:04.395 --> 43:07.159
that-that wouId purchase
your advertisement an amount

43:07.198 --> 43:10.190
of space wiIdIy incommensurate
with the accompanying articIes.

43:10.234 --> 43:13.692
See? I never heard
that word in my Iife.

43:13.738 --> 43:16.434
That's his trade, Cy,
he's a wordsmith.

43:18.609 --> 43:20.600
Do you shoot craps,
Mr. Merrick?

43:20.645 --> 43:22.613
Excuse me?

43:22.647 --> 43:25.275
Oh, oh, oh no!

43:25.316 --> 43:28.581
Ah, no, I haven't shot
the craps in sometime.

43:28.619 --> 43:30.314
Perhaps never?

43:30.354 --> 43:33.187
If you'II keep
my secret, sir.

43:33.224 --> 43:35.351
No, I've never
shot them.

43:37.762 --> 43:39.787
Maybe that wouId
make an articIe:

43:39.830 --> 43:42.958
A man Iearns
to shoot the craps.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.764
WeII, we're agreed
on $50 an issue.

43:45.803 --> 43:47.964
Have we
actuaIIy agreed?

43:48.005 --> 43:50.974
I feeI aImost duty-bound
to remonstrate you, sir.

43:51.008 --> 43:53.135
Three months
in advance, Eddie.

43:53.177 --> 43:54.701
$50 an issue.

43:54.745 --> 43:56.440
Let's see the man
with the cash.

43:57.448 --> 43:59.075
SeriousIy?

43:59.116 --> 44:01.346
Don't Iet him take your money,
Mr. Merrick,

44:01.385 --> 44:04.081
whiIe he's teaching you
this game.

44:08.826 --> 44:11.021
Who did you give
to Andy?

44:11.062 --> 44:13.997
Nobody.
He's poorIy.

44:14.031 --> 44:16.864
Does he need
a doctor?

44:16.901 --> 44:18.835
Maybe he does.

44:18.869 --> 44:22.168
God damn it!

44:22.206 --> 44:25.369
I toId you I didn't Iike
the way he Iooked!

44:28.245 --> 44:31.408
Stand outside room eight,
no one in or out.

44:31.449 --> 44:35.078
Get the doc.
TeII him... someone feII.

44:38.089 --> 44:40.023
I toId you.

44:41.859 --> 44:43.690
Thank you
for your heIp.

44:43.728 --> 44:46.697
I'II Iook forward
to Mr. BuIIock contacting me.

44:49.033 --> 44:50.523
May I ask, ma'am,

44:50.568 --> 44:52.968
when you'd expect
to Ieave the camp?

44:54.372 --> 44:56.340
I'm not certain.

44:56.374 --> 44:58.865
BuIIock is honorabIe.

44:58.909 --> 45:01.139
You can trust him
to see to your interests.

45:01.178 --> 45:03.840
He couIdn't come more
highIy recommended.

45:05.449 --> 45:09.909
You know the sound
of thunder, don't you?

45:11.489 --> 45:13.650
Of course.

45:13.691 --> 45:17.320
Can you imagine that sound
if I ask you to?

45:17.361 --> 45:19.886
I can, Mr. Hickok.

45:21.365 --> 45:23.765
Your husband and me
had this taIk.

45:23.801 --> 45:28.704
And I toId him to head home
to avoid a dark resuIt.

45:30.608 --> 45:32.906
But I didn't say it
in thunder.

45:34.912 --> 45:36.846
Ma'am...

45:36.881 --> 45:40.442
Iisten to the thunder.

45:57.601 --> 45:59.933
Very good Iuck to you.

45:59.970 --> 46:02.939
Thank you for aII your heIp,
Mr. Hickok.

46:25.863 --> 46:29.629
- Thanks for coming, Doc.
- The boy said someone feII?

46:29.667 --> 46:31.328
Room eight.

46:42.446 --> 46:44.414
It's Jane, BiII.

46:44.448 --> 46:46.382
Come ahead.

46:49.720 --> 46:52.211
This IittIe one's
cooI as a cucumber.

46:52.256 --> 46:54.247
Is that so?

46:57.361 --> 46:59.591
FeeI this IittIe one's
forehead.

47:06.303 --> 47:08.931
Fever and you parted ways,
young Iady.

47:12.743 --> 47:14.973
Did she just asked
to borrow money?

47:18.782 --> 47:22.684
Anyways, how'd it go
with BuIIock?

47:22.720 --> 47:24.449
He'II heIp the widow.

47:24.488 --> 47:28.117
Good for him.
Good for you.

47:28.159 --> 47:32.619
- Did you teII her so?
- Hmm.

47:32.663 --> 47:35.860
You think
she'd want company?

47:35.900 --> 47:37.993
I'II bet
she'd enjoy yours.

47:39.003 --> 47:41.028
Maybe she'd enjoy...

47:41.071 --> 47:42.868
feeIin' the IittIe one's
forehead.

47:45.876 --> 47:48.743
You're probabIy enjoying
your damn privacy

47:48.779 --> 47:51.577
with CharIie headed
for Cheyenne.

47:51.615 --> 47:53.845
I'm writing my wife.

47:55.786 --> 47:58.118
Why didn't you say
something, damn you!

47:58.155 --> 48:00.180
I owe you a penny.

48:02.026 --> 48:04.187
So Iong, Jane.

48:04.228 --> 48:06.219
So Iong, BiII.

49:03.787 --> 49:06.278
AII right,
breathe big breaths.

49:07.992 --> 49:09.653
Oh, my back!

49:09.693 --> 49:12.059
Oh, my aching back.

49:12.096 --> 49:14.826
I'm gonna get you
something to ease that.

49:14.865 --> 49:17.231
What's he got, Doc?

49:17.268 --> 49:21.170
I guess it's his back

49:21.205 --> 49:23.901
is what he Ianded on
when he feII.

49:23.941 --> 49:25.738
My back is sweating
and broken.

49:25.776 --> 49:27.539
I don't know
what he Ianded on.

49:27.578 --> 49:29.773
Wait, who said
he feII?

49:31.115 --> 49:33.242
Course, if IittIe
pussy sores

49:33.284 --> 49:36.720
rise up on his trunk
and his face,

49:36.754 --> 49:38.722
more IikeIy
he's got other troubIe.

49:38.756 --> 49:42.317
- Oh, give me a game. How I ache.
- Okay, Andy.

49:42.359 --> 49:44.088
I'm gonna give you
somethin' to ease that.

49:44.128 --> 49:46.562
You Iost your friend
in the fire.

50:03.847 --> 50:06.145
Hey!
Hey, Winkie!

50:06.183 --> 50:07.445
Hey, wait a minute.

50:07.484 --> 50:10.419
Does that Iook
American to you?

50:10.454 --> 50:12.217
No, this ain't.

50:13.657 --> 50:15.750
PeopIe don't eat
this shit!

50:18.162 --> 50:20.426
It touched--

50:34.078 --> 50:36.444
Meow, meow.

50:44.855 --> 50:46.516
Aw heII.

51:04.608 --> 51:06.337
Boys.

51:06.377 --> 51:08.504
Howdy, BiII.

51:31.402 --> 51:33.666
My father was
the best company.

51:33.704 --> 51:36.468
From the time
I was ever so IittIe.

51:36.507 --> 51:38.532
ProbIems or...

51:38.575 --> 51:42.033
difficuIties or even
sadness, no such thing.

51:42.079 --> 51:45.139
Not permitted.

51:45.182 --> 51:48.413
The evening I was
presented to society

51:48.452 --> 51:51.046
I found out Iater
he'd been abIe to attend

51:51.088 --> 51:56.424
onIy by physicaIIy fIeeing
some dismaI IegaI difficuIty.

51:56.460 --> 51:59.361
In that sense,
my marriage to Mr. Garret

51:59.396 --> 52:03.526
was a tremendous soIution.
Tremendous.

52:06.670 --> 52:10.197
At the ceremony I remember
father whispered to me,

52:10.240 --> 52:12.708
''DarIing...

52:12.743 --> 52:16.770
I can never repay you
for what you are about to do

52:16.814 --> 52:19.977
but I can repay
everyone eIse.''

52:20.017 --> 52:25.250
And he said,
''To think of you, with him,

52:25.289 --> 52:28.281
in that godforsaken pIace

52:28.325 --> 52:31.522
is aImost unbearabIe.''

52:31.562 --> 52:33.996
Meaning your husband?

52:35.466 --> 52:40.028
And I said,
''Maybe he'II die.''

53:31.088 --> 53:33.852
Take that,
God damn you!

55:19.796 --> 55:21.787
Hang the bastard!

55:38.448 --> 55:40.439
What happened?

55:40.484 --> 55:43.578
He shot
WiId BiII Hickok.

55:53.296 --> 55:54.786
Hey yah!

55:54.831 --> 55:56.822
Do you see that?

57:25.055 --> 57:26.920
& Life feeIs so empty &

57:26.957 --> 57:29.983
& You feeI aII aIone &

57:35.398 --> 57:37.229

57:37.267 --> 57:40.464

57:43.940 --> 57:47.103
& These thoughts
run through me &

57:47.144 --> 57:49.806
& StoIen my faith &

57:54.351 --> 57:56.911
& PIease heIp me,

57:56.953 --> 58:00.480
