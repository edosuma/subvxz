-[heartbeats]
-[siren wails]

00:36.161 --> 00:37.287
[Jess] Somebody help!

00:37.704 --> 00:39.205
Somebody help, please!

00:40.457 --> 00:41.458
[Foundry] Back up!

00:43.293 --> 00:45.545
[indistinct announcement over PA]

00:47.297 --> 00:48.757
[Clay] That was a week ago.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.593
[heart monitor beeps]

00:54.137 --> 00:56.264
He's been in the hospital ever since.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.686
Intensive care.

01:02.228 --> 01:05.148
[Ellman] Your mother called
to cancel your Tuesday appointment.

01:05.231 --> 01:07.484
She told me some of what Justin's facing.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.236
Yeah, it's not great.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.363
How does it make you feel?

01:13.448 --> 01:15.366
What the fuck does it matter what I feel?

01:15.450 --> 01:17.285
I think it matters a great deal.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.662
-You know that.
-I don't know that!

01:19.746 --> 01:22.916
I don't know anything.
We talk and talk, and nothing happens,

01:22.999 --> 01:26.044
and I still feel like I'm gonna spin off
the face of the fucking Earth,

01:26.127 --> 01:28.213
then we keep talking,
and we don't get anywhere!

01:28.296 --> 01:31.216
You don't think we made any progress
these past few months?

01:31.299 --> 01:34.010
No! I just... All of this just seems so...

01:34.094 --> 01:35.845
I don't know! Like selfish!

01:36.262 --> 01:38.431
Talking about feelings...

01:38.890 --> 01:39.849
to you...

01:40.433 --> 01:42.143
when Justin is... is...

01:45.355 --> 01:46.314
is sick.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.400
Because what he's going through
is so serious.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.904
And what you're going through
seems less important now

01:52.987 --> 01:55.281
because his life hangs in the balance.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.283
Yes.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.077
But in the work we do together,

01:59.494 --> 02:01.412
in trying to help you get well,

02:02.247 --> 02:04.582
doesn't your own life hang in the balance?

02:06.292 --> 02:07.210
[clicks tongue]

02:09.629 --> 02:10.547
[whispers] Yes.

02:11.506 --> 02:12.882
So let's keep working.

02:15.593 --> 02:18.138
Do you wanna tell me
how it's been at the hospital?

02:20.431 --> 02:22.684
[woman] Justin has given me permission

02:22.767 --> 02:25.770
to discuss his treatment
and diagnosis with you.

02:27.897 --> 02:30.233
I'm afraid
I have some difficult news to share.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.029
Justin has tested positive for HIV-1.

02:35.905 --> 02:38.700
And based on his symptoms,
we believe...

02:39.242 --> 02:41.244
it has progressed to AIDS.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.456
-That's...
-[sniffles]

02:46.666 --> 02:48.251
[Matt] How is that possible?

02:48.334 --> 02:49.460
He... he had the flu.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.171
He's been tired.

02:51.254 --> 02:54.465
Well, HIV has a long period of latency
after infection,

02:54.883 --> 02:57.594
which means that Justin
may not have shown any symptoms

02:57.677 --> 02:58.803
for some time.

02:58.887 --> 03:03.224
With his IV drug use
and extended periods of homelessness,

03:03.308 --> 03:05.643
this would have made him more susceptible

03:05.727 --> 03:07.312
to rapid progression.

03:07.395 --> 03:10.273
And according to his records,
he was never tested.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.442
How... how has he never been tested?

03:12.984 --> 03:15.820
We got him the best GP.
He had a complete physical.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.864
[doctor] Testing requires patient consent.

03:17.947 --> 03:21.993
It's not uncommon for a young man
with a history of IV drug use and sex work

03:22.076 --> 03:23.620
to avoid testing.

03:23.703 --> 03:24.746
Sex work?

03:27.749 --> 03:30.919
Justin never spoke to you
about the time he spent homeless?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.715
Not about that part, no.

03:38.801 --> 03:41.971
The pneumocystis pneumonia has
an indolent presentation,

03:42.430 --> 03:46.351
which means that the symptoms
develop slowly over some weeks,

03:46.434 --> 03:48.519
and there was a late diagnosis...

03:50.521 --> 03:52.982
There is also a neurological infection.

03:54.859 --> 03:58.488
A fungal meningitis
that has not advanced quite so far,

03:59.656 --> 04:01.574
but is pervasive.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.867
[heart monitor beeps]

04:06.162 --> 04:06.996
Hey.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.958
-Hey. [chuckles]
-[Clay] Um...

04:10.041 --> 04:11.334
How is it today?

04:11.709 --> 04:13.544
[Justin] Uh, it's like yesterday.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.088
Just a little worse.

04:15.171 --> 04:16.339
[Justin chuckles weakly]

04:17.757 --> 04:21.344
Uh, so, there's, like, a lineup of people
who'd like to see you,

04:21.427 --> 04:23.805
but I understand
if you don't wanna see them.

04:23.888 --> 04:26.307
And I've organized a list
and given time limits, and--

04:26.766 --> 04:28.434
[both chuckle]

04:28.518 --> 04:29.686
Of course you have.

04:29.769 --> 04:30.812
[laughs awkwardly]

04:32.772 --> 04:33.898
Yeah, sure.

04:35.817 --> 04:36.734
Bring it on.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.238
I'll send in the first appointment.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.502
[Clay sighs]

04:56.004 --> 04:57.130
[exhales slowly]

04:58.840 --> 05:00.174
Listen, the, uh...

05:01.467 --> 05:05.263
The doctor was talking us through stuff,
and, uh...

05:05.346 --> 05:06.180
[Alex] Hey.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.934
-I'm sorry, Charlie made me.
-[chuckles]

05:10.435 --> 05:11.519
[laughs wheezily]

05:12.478 --> 05:14.314
Charlie can come in too.

05:17.191 --> 05:19.777
See, I told you he wouldn't mind
both of us at once.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.655
-[Alex] I'll put it here.
-Uh...

05:22.739 --> 05:25.158
They wouldn't let us
bring in any flowers, so...

05:25.241 --> 05:27.702
So, giant bears.
Basically, the same thing.

05:27.785 --> 05:28.870
[all laugh]

05:29.370 --> 05:32.206
-[Charlie] His name's Tiger.
-[Alex] This is a panda.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.459
-[Justin laughs] Tiger panda.
-[Alex] Yeah.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.585
[Justin] I like it.

05:35.668 --> 05:38.755
[Clay] It's like the whole world
just shifted out from under our feet.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.300
Like the darkness just closed in.

05:44.385 --> 05:45.386
Prom pictures.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.972
Some good ones of you and Estela.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.142
You should frame one for her.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.310
Oh, wow.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.645
Wow, these are really great.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.147
Hey, thank you.

05:58.232 --> 05:59.442
I know it was Jessica...

06:01.069 --> 06:02.111
who killed Bryce.

06:03.112 --> 06:06.783
And I know Clay and Ani
and some group of you framed Monty.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.952
I almost have what I need
to go to the police.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.663
But I don't have to include you.

06:12.747 --> 06:13.748
[inhales deeply]

06:14.123 --> 06:15.208
You got it all wrong.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.126
You don't really know anything,

06:17.210 --> 06:20.171
and Jessica and Clay and Ani,

06:20.254 --> 06:21.255
they're my friends.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.426
So anything you do to them,
you do to me too.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.470
[tense music plays]

06:32.433 --> 06:33.768
[door opens]

06:37.355 --> 06:38.356
[door closes]

06:45.822 --> 06:47.198
[wind howling]

06:52.537 --> 06:54.122
I think he was ashamed.

06:55.373 --> 06:56.874
That's why he didn't tell you?

06:58.251 --> 07:01.170
I... I wouldn't have, like, judged.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.463
[Jess] It's not that.

07:03.005 --> 07:03.923
It just...

07:04.882 --> 07:06.134
It takes time.

07:07.385 --> 07:08.928
To deal with what is.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.806
[message alert pings]

07:13.057 --> 07:14.392
Zach's downstairs.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.102
He says he can't come in.

07:17.353 --> 07:18.646
Fucking Zach.

07:25.069 --> 07:25.945
Hey.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.321
Hey, what the fuck?

07:27.947 --> 07:30.533
-All right, get upstairs.
-I can't, man. I just...

07:32.034 --> 07:33.911
Hospitals. [clears throat, sniffs]

07:33.995 --> 07:35.246
You need to see him.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.251
Man, I watched my dad die
in this hospital.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.336
Yeah?

07:43.921 --> 07:47.049
Yeah, me and my dad
brought my mom home from this hospital

07:47.133 --> 07:48.843
so she could die in her own bed.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.219
[Zach sniffs]

07:50.303 --> 07:53.806
And you know what? Right now,
your best friend is really sick upstairs,

07:53.890 --> 07:54.974
and if you don't go see him,

07:55.057 --> 07:57.894
you are gonna regret this
for the rest of your fucking life!

08:01.230 --> 08:02.648
I can't, man. [sniffles]

08:03.065 --> 08:05.693
-I can't.
-[Charlie scoffs]

08:06.110 --> 08:09.197
[Clay] Like, prom was actually
our last chance at being kids.

08:10.823 --> 08:11.908
Then all of a sudden,

08:12.742 --> 08:13.784
playtime over.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.668
There's no more hiding from it,

08:23.252 --> 08:24.337
what's out there.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.843
Hi. I was really surprised you texted me.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.054
It was me.

08:37.099 --> 08:38.559
I killed Bryce Walker.

08:44.398 --> 08:45.775
-You're lying.
-[Alex] No.

08:46.567 --> 08:49.153
I found him on the pier. I was alone.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.197
I tried to help him up.
He threatened to hurt Zach.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.241
I shoved him in the river. He drowned.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.328
-Alex.
-[Alex] Yeah, so...

08:58.579 --> 09:00.331
that information is yours now.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.167
Do what you want with it.

09:09.632 --> 09:12.343
-[heart monitor beeps]
-[ventilator draws in air]

09:16.556 --> 09:17.723
[doctor clears throat]

09:18.516 --> 09:20.518
The ventilator breathes for him.

09:21.018 --> 09:25.690
It keeps his blood oxygenated
and helps protect against organ failure.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.403
How long does he have to be on it?

09:32.446 --> 09:33.573
[doctor clears throat]

09:34.115 --> 09:35.116
Uh, honey...

09:40.121 --> 09:42.665
He may never be able to breathe
without it again.

09:46.043 --> 09:49.171
So, like,
when he gets out of the hospital?

09:53.718 --> 09:56.095
[doctor] The disease in his lungs
is quite advanced.

09:56.178 --> 09:59.599
And we're also starting to see
advanced neurological symptoms.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.978
The goal is
to keep him as comfortable as possible

10:04.061 --> 10:06.939
and manage the symptoms as best as we can.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.983
[panting]

10:09.984 --> 10:11.694
Honey! Clay?

10:11.777 --> 10:14.488
I feel like I just... I need some air.
[panting]

10:14.614 --> 10:17.950
-[Matt] Clay!
-[Lainie] Does he just need some space?

10:18.743 --> 10:19.994
Should we give him space?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.079
Now? Is that really a good idea?

10:23.664 --> 10:24.832
[Lainie sniffles]

10:28.127 --> 10:29.170
[tense music plays]

10:29.253 --> 10:32.131
Whoa! Clay! Clay, what happened?
Is everything OK?

10:33.049 --> 10:34.675
What do you fucking think, Zach?

10:35.176 --> 10:37.637
He's never getting any better!
He's fucking dying!

10:41.349 --> 10:42.808
Should we go after him?

10:43.267 --> 10:44.977
[sighs] Jesus, I don't know.

10:47.104 --> 10:48.105
Where'd he go?

10:48.439 --> 10:49.857
Uh, up the street, that way.

10:49.940 --> 10:53.069
-Where's he going? What's down there?
-No clue, Mr. Jensen.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.907
[breathing heavily]

11:00.826 --> 11:03.496
[Clay] And we can't stop it.
We can't stop it.

11:03.579 --> 11:04.705
We can't.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.667
We're spinning and spinning,
and we're about to disappear.

11:20.971 --> 11:22.598
[breathing heavily]

11:23.599 --> 11:25.309
[suspenseful music plays]

11:59.552 --> 12:00.594
[quietly] I, um...

12:02.513 --> 12:03.597
I have a gun.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.937
[yells] I said I have a gun!

12:10.020 --> 12:11.522
[panicked shrieking]

12:11.605 --> 12:13.524
And I'll fucking use it if I have to,

12:13.607 --> 12:15.151
so everybody back the fuck up!

12:15.234 --> 12:17.027
I have a gun. I have a gun!

12:17.111 --> 12:18.529
Clay. [shushes]

12:18.612 --> 12:20.823
[Diaz] Clay, hey.
Hey, what's going on here?

12:20.906 --> 12:22.116
I... I have a gun.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.452
All right,
well, let's just take a breath here.

12:24.785 --> 12:27.872
Slowly take your hands outta your pockets
so no one gets hurt.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.039
People are already hurt!

12:29.123 --> 12:33.294
Nobody pays for the things that happen!
No one ever pays! And someone should!

12:33.961 --> 12:35.337
You must hurt so much.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.299
Put the gun down,
and we'll talk about it. OK?

12:42.470 --> 12:43.429
Clay?

12:44.930 --> 12:45.890
Clay?

12:48.267 --> 12:49.769
-Clay!
-[Diaz] Get down!

12:49.852 --> 12:50.770
Hey, get down!

12:51.228 --> 12:52.521
Clay! What the fuck?

12:52.605 --> 12:54.940
Put your guns down!
Guys, put your guns down!

12:55.024 --> 12:56.692
-Guns down, everybody!
-[Clay] Tony?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.652
Put your guns down.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.530
Hey, Clay.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.365
Clay, listen to me, buddy.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.621
I know you're going through a lot
right now.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.748
I know you've been through a lot.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.292
More than any kid
should ever have to deal with.

13:15.252 --> 13:16.295
But listen to me.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.800
Everyone in this room?
Every one of those deputies?

13:20.883 --> 13:22.468
Everyone wants the same thing,

13:23.135 --> 13:24.678
and that's for you to be safe.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.014
To stay alive. OK?

13:29.767 --> 13:32.269
Tony... He's your best friend, right?

13:34.855 --> 13:36.357
Tony wants you to be safe.

13:37.191 --> 13:39.109
And that's all that matters right now.

13:40.736 --> 13:43.155
I can't promise
that it gets better right away.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.325
But the only chance we have,

13:47.076 --> 13:49.411
the only way things can start
to feel better...

13:50.955 --> 13:52.331
is if you give me that gun.

13:53.791 --> 13:54.750
OK?

13:55.918 --> 13:58.003
I promise you, no one will hurt you.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.297
Just give me the gun.

14:03.634 --> 14:04.802
You can talk to me.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.306
[tense music plays]

14:16.230 --> 14:18.440
[Clay breathes shakily]

14:20.526 --> 14:21.527
[sobs quietly]

14:24.113 --> 14:24.947
[Diaz] It's OK.

14:26.115 --> 14:26.991
All right.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.410
[sobs loudly]

14:31.954 --> 14:32.955
[Diaz] All right.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.374
[wailing sobs]

14:38.377 --> 14:40.588
[Ellman] Did you feel
that you wanted to die?

14:40.671 --> 14:42.256
[Clay] No, that wasn't it.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.467
I just...

14:48.178 --> 14:49.471
I wanted someone to...

14:51.015 --> 14:52.099
To notice you.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.645
To see you were hurting.

14:58.647 --> 14:59.481
Yeah.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.108
[Diaz] All right, buddy.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.653
[pats Clay] All right, I'm here.

15:05.696 --> 15:06.697
You're safe.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.743
-[Clay] We talked for a while...
-[Diaz] It's all right.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.119
...me and the Sheriff.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.956
He didn't bust me for pulling that stunt.

15:16.749 --> 15:17.791
And it was, like,

15:19.043 --> 15:20.669
almost like he understood.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.255
Understood what?

15:23.339 --> 15:25.591
[Clay] That I was freaking out. And why.

15:25.674 --> 15:29.595
And I realized that all that attention
he'd been giving me this spring?

15:29.678 --> 15:33.182
Like, showing up at school
and meeting with my parents,

15:34.308 --> 15:35.643
he was worried about me.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.687
And that surprises you.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.023
I mean, he arrested me once.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.734
But in both cases, then and now,

15:43.817 --> 15:45.569
wasn't he just doing his job?

15:45.653 --> 15:49.406
Yeah. And... And I think
maybe he's pretty good at his job.

15:51.492 --> 15:52.493
In a...

15:53.035 --> 15:55.079
sneaky, manipulative way.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.082
Like you.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.875
I'll take the compliment.

16:01.919 --> 16:06.048
[Clay] After that, he, um, put me and Tony
in a room while he talked to my dad.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.300
Tony had been in a street fight.

16:09.134 --> 16:12.972
I'm not sure if they put me in here
to look after you or the other way around.

16:14.473 --> 16:17.267
We haven't been doing that so great
for each other lately.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.984
[Ellman] How's Justin doing now?

16:28.320 --> 16:29.321
Not better.

16:34.660 --> 16:38.288
[Clay] There's this thing. I mean,
I've been calling it hospital time.

16:38.872 --> 16:40.541
You lose track of days.

16:40.624 --> 16:42.167
It's all one long day.

16:43.627 --> 16:46.505
Time moves so slowly,
and then a week has gone by.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.848
And I think it's got everyone messed up.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.224
The waiting.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.350
The not knowing.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.270
Or the knowing.

17:04.815 --> 17:05.983
[Zach groans lightly]

17:12.322 --> 17:14.867
Something tells me
you boys aren't here to party.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.076
Oh... OK.

17:16.618 --> 17:20.247
Whoa! Hey, that's a single barrel
small batch Corlett. What the fuck?

17:20.330 --> 17:23.042
Fuckin' bourbon, guys.
You can't even tell the difference!

17:23.500 --> 17:25.502
There are two more in the car, black.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.880
You're gonna get those in you,
and go see Justin.

17:28.547 --> 17:29.715
All right, look,

17:30.257 --> 17:31.467
Mothers Teresa.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.512
Learn to know a lost cause
when you see one, like me.

17:36.513 --> 17:37.431
Like Justin.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.143
[sighs] OK, Zach.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.439
Do you remember on the rooftop?
The night I kissed you?

17:45.522 --> 17:48.442
-You kissed him?
-It was a shit show. I'll explain later.

17:48.525 --> 17:50.527
-But you remember that night?
-Yeah.

17:51.028 --> 17:54.156
[Alex] OK. That kiss was embarrassing.
It was a disaster.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.532
But right before that,

17:56.158 --> 17:57.242
when I almost fell,

17:58.035 --> 17:59.912
you pulled me back from the ledge.

17:59.995 --> 18:03.165
And I'll never forget the feeling
of your hands grabbing me

18:03.248 --> 18:04.500
and keeping me safe.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.294
I needed it. I didn't know it.

18:08.670 --> 18:09.922
And now you need it.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.049
[sighs]

18:12.758 --> 18:15.552
The kiss wasn't a disaster,
it was a nice kiss, per se.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.638
-Wait, it was?
-Yeah. Yeah.

18:17.721 --> 18:20.974
I don't love Justin,
but I love you, and you love him.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.851

18:55.926 --> 18:58.387
[Clay] I guess it's like high school,
in its way.

18:59.763 --> 19:02.182
It seems like I was a freshman
a decade ago.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.309
But then it seems like yesterday.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.151
I don't know where all that time went.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.195
I don't know what we do now.

19:19.700 --> 19:20.909
[Caleb] Here he is now.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.202
Who are you talking to?

19:22.286 --> 19:23.328
It's, uh...

19:24.121 --> 19:25.164
It's your dad.

19:29.543 --> 19:30.878
Antonio! [chuckles]

19:33.255 --> 19:34.464
How's your friend?

19:35.799 --> 19:37.217
He's not good, papá.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.304
[Arturo] You good to be there for him.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.806
You're a good friend.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.435
That's always important, m'hijo.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.396
I guess... I guess so, yeah.

19:49.813 --> 19:52.357
But you have to think
about yourself sometimes.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.402
Caleb told me about the college offer.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.821
He did?

19:58.488 --> 19:59.573
[Arturo] Damn proud of you.

20:01.658 --> 20:02.784
It's time, m'hijo.

20:03.952 --> 20:07.247
It's time you sell the shop
and get on with your life.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.542
We can't afford that, papá.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.753
We have work here.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.546
We're gonna be fine.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.175
The shop is your dream.

20:18.258 --> 20:19.426
[Arturo] Listen to me.

20:19.885 --> 20:20.886
That shop...

20:21.845 --> 20:23.388
was never my dream.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.017
You...

20:28.769 --> 20:30.812
You are my dream.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.607
Why do we do everything?

20:34.024 --> 20:36.485
So that you can have a better life
than we did.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.820
This is your better life, m'hijo.

20:39.696 --> 20:41.240
Don't fuck up my dream.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.871
[Clay] Ancient history is
somehow present tense.

20:47.955 --> 20:50.457
Everything is ending, but nothing is over.

20:51.416 --> 20:55.087
And none of us knows how to make sense
of the jumble of things that happened.

20:59.883 --> 21:00.884
I win.

21:03.887 --> 21:05.847
Come on, why the silent treatment?

21:05.931 --> 21:08.100
I'm just here to pay my respects to Justy.

21:08.183 --> 21:09.434
You killed him.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.106
Yeah, I did.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.444
I don't rape Hannah,
none of us are here, right?

21:20.404 --> 21:21.822
He doesn't run away.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.449
Doesn't start shooting up.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.286
Letting men fuck him.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.080
How can one person cause so much pain?

21:30.163 --> 21:31.373
Look in the mirror.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.834
-You let me die.
-You deserved to die.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.419
Yeah, maybe.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.672
But here we are.

21:41.258 --> 21:42.634
You probably have it too.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.846
Fuck you.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.181
[snickers] Yeah.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.309
-I win.
-[Clay] Jess.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.314
Um... he's up.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.691
If you wanna say hey.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.902
He can't say anything back,
but he writes, so...

22:01.486 --> 22:03.071
-If... if you want to.
-Yeah.

22:08.493 --> 22:11.830
["Salesman at the Day of the Parade"
by Rogue Wave plays]

22:22.466 --> 22:25.177
[Clay] You start to wonder
if anything meant anything.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.057
If all we're doing is reacting,

22:32.976 --> 22:35.437
and the reactions
don't even make any difference.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.026
I got into Brown.

22:41.485 --> 22:42.652
That crazy interview?

22:43.487 --> 22:44.571
Didn't even matter.

22:45.197 --> 22:48.533
So if nothing fucking matters,
like, why bother?

22:53.080 --> 22:54.539
[Foundry] How's Justin doing?

22:57.667 --> 22:59.044
[Clay] He's not any better.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.129
[Foundry] I'm so sorry.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.843
I've lost, in my life,
a number of friends...

23:07.386 --> 23:09.805
and one very good friend to that disease.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.265
I'm very sorry.

23:14.643 --> 23:15.477
Thank you.

23:16.686 --> 23:20.065
I'm sure you're not thinking about
graduation right now, but... [sighs]

23:20.148 --> 23:23.652
it's my duty to tell you
that you have been voted class speaker.

23:29.116 --> 23:29.950
What?

23:33.745 --> 23:34.663
Me? Uh...

23:35.622 --> 23:36.540
How?

23:37.040 --> 23:40.669
Apparently, your classmates think you have
something relevant to say to them.

23:41.628 --> 23:45.048
I imagine it might have something to do
with your sermon on the car

23:45.132 --> 23:46.883
at the disturbance a few weeks ago.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.218
That's, uh...

23:48.844 --> 23:51.096
[clicks tongue] That wasn't really me.

23:51.179 --> 23:54.433
[Foundry] Then reach out to whoever it was
'cause he's needed on stage June 22nd.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.476
I need to review his speech in advance,

23:56.560 --> 23:59.938
just to ensure it doesn't start any riots,
that sorta thing.

24:00.021 --> 24:02.315
[inhales deeply] Congratulations, Clay.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.534
[Clay] It doesn't make any sense.
I have nothing to say.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.121
Well, your classmates disagree.

24:17.372 --> 24:19.916
And as someone who's been talking to you
for many weeks now,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.544
I think you have a great deal to say.

24:24.087 --> 24:25.297
Who's the signature?

24:25.380 --> 24:27.340
Ah, you probably haven't heard of him.

24:28.049 --> 24:29.176
Lindsey Buckingham.

24:30.635 --> 24:31.887
Fleetwood Mac.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.638
Although I prefer his solo stuff.

24:34.848 --> 24:35.849
I do too.

24:37.058 --> 24:38.351
You think I'm stalling?

24:38.435 --> 24:39.769
[Ellman] Are you stalling?

24:40.520 --> 24:42.522
What kind of bullshit speech can I give?

24:42.606 --> 24:45.901
I can't...
I can't get up there and say, like,

24:46.318 --> 24:48.570
"Hope for the future!
And the best days are ahead!"

24:48.653 --> 24:49.613
I mean, Jesus!

24:50.280 --> 24:53.241
Justin is lying there in that hospital.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.202
He's never coming out, he's dying,

24:55.285 --> 24:58.371
and I'm supposed to give some speech
about the future?

24:59.122 --> 25:00.415
There is no future!

25:01.249 --> 25:05.587
It's hard to think about your own future
when Justin's future is so uncertain.

25:06.546 --> 25:09.591
Oh, my God, if you continue on
with that fucking calm tone,

25:09.674 --> 25:12.844
I'm gonna lose it.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna fucking lose it!

25:13.303 --> 25:14.262
OK.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.599
Now you're just messing with me.
[sighs]

25:17.682 --> 25:19.142
No, Clay. I'm not.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.770
Honest, I'm just saying that...

25:23.522 --> 25:24.606
it's OK...

25:25.273 --> 25:27.317
in here... with me...

25:28.401 --> 25:30.111
if you lose it a little bit.

[Clay sighs]

25:49.839 --> 25:51.174
Look, to give a speech,

25:52.717 --> 25:55.554
about anything,
you have to make some kind of sense.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.307
And nothing makes sense.

26:01.893 --> 26:04.771
-[Clay] And all the pieces are just...
-[door opens]

26:04.854 --> 26:06.565
...scattered all over the floor.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.150
I ran to Monet's. I just...

26:09.859 --> 26:10.860
Hospital coffee.

26:10.944 --> 26:12.028
I couldn't anymore.

26:12.445 --> 26:13.572
Good call.

26:14.364 --> 26:15.407
[sighs]

26:21.788 --> 26:25.041
I keep thinking this'll get easier,
and it just gets harder.

26:26.376 --> 26:27.502
Every day of this.

26:28.211 --> 26:31.381
Well, you don't want it
to start to feel normal, do you?

26:32.674 --> 26:33.675
No. [chuckles]

26:35.885 --> 26:38.638
[Matt] I remember my grandfather dying
when I was 14.

26:40.515 --> 26:42.017
My first experience of it.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.020
And you...

26:46.313 --> 26:48.982
You've looked at death too many times
for a young person.

26:49.065 --> 26:50.692
Your generation, it's...

26:51.192 --> 26:52.193
it's not right.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.616
I'm sorry if I scared you the other night.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.745
I won't scare you ever again.

27:02.537 --> 27:03.747
Clay... [Matt chuckles]

Too much hate,

43:33.944 --> 43:35.321
anger, and hurt.

43:36.989 --> 43:39.825
We talk a good game
about protecting our children,

43:39.908 --> 43:44.038
but we leave too much on the table
that might surely save their lives.

43:45.289 --> 43:48.250
Justin Foley died of a disease

43:48.334 --> 43:50.586
that, from its inception,

43:50.669 --> 43:52.880
thrives in silence.

43:53.797 --> 43:56.383
And there are a number of such diseases,

43:56.467 --> 44:01.764
a number of ills
that thrive when we are silent about them.

44:02.765 --> 44:05.976
Because we let our fears, our shame,

44:06.060 --> 44:10.439
our twisted moral codes
keep us in silence,

44:10.522 --> 44:13.484
as death stalks more children.

44:13.567 --> 44:15.611
I say, enough.

44:18.280 --> 44:19.907
Enough shifting blame.

44:20.616 --> 44:22.201
Enough pointing fingers.

44:22.743 --> 44:26.163
Enough confusing those
who report the damage

44:26.246 --> 44:28.290
with those who cause it.

44:29.875 --> 44:33.212
Let us remember Justin
for his accomplishments

44:33.295 --> 44:35.798
on the football field
and the basketball court.

44:36.799 --> 44:39.176
Let us remember his smile

44:39.718 --> 44:43.013
that I am told melted a hundred hearts.

44:44.056 --> 44:46.600
But let's also remember his death

44:47.309 --> 44:49.645
with sorrow and determination

44:50.312 --> 44:51.814
that spur us...

44:52.481 --> 44:53.565
to action.

44:56.110 --> 44:57.027
Amen.

45:04.910 --> 45:06.036
Um...

45:07.287 --> 45:08.414
I...

45:10.040 --> 45:12.209
I'm not sure I can do this. Uh...

45:14.002 --> 45:14.962
[sighs]

45:15.421 --> 45:16.255
Um...

45:17.840 --> 45:18.674
Uh...

45:19.341 --> 45:20.300
I believe...

45:20.843 --> 45:21.927
[stammering] I believe...

45:23.971 --> 45:27.641
I believe
Justin Foley helped save my life.

45:29.435 --> 45:30.644
I didn't like him.

45:32.146 --> 45:33.564
And he didn't like me.

45:34.148 --> 45:35.023
But...

45:36.150 --> 45:37.776
when I needed him,

45:39.653 --> 45:40.738
he helped me.

45:43.824 --> 45:44.658
Um...

45:45.117 --> 45:46.660
Sorry, I'm... [voice catches]

45:48.662 --> 45:49.663
Go. Go get him.

45:54.001 --> 45:55.794
[Clay] Alex tried to say something...

45:55.878 --> 45:57.671
-[Bill] You all right?
-Yeah.

45:57.755 --> 45:58.964
OK, let's go sit down.

45:59.047 --> 46:00.674
[Clay] ...as much as he could.

46:03.552 --> 46:06.013
But there's so much
none of us could ever say.

46:09.433 --> 46:10.851
Last time I was up here,

46:12.478 --> 46:14.188
I said I was my brother's keeper.

46:15.397 --> 46:16.482
That we all are.

46:18.317 --> 46:20.194
Even though I didn't live up to that.

46:25.574 --> 46:26.867
Justin hated running.

46:29.661 --> 46:32.414
Coach Kerba would make him do a mile,
and he would bitch

46:32.498 --> 46:33.957
-and complain...
-[chuckles]

46:34.041 --> 46:35.000
...the whole time.

46:36.335 --> 46:39.588
Coach Kerba would tell him that pain

46:39.963 --> 46:42.424
is the feeling of weakness
leaving the body.

46:46.136 --> 46:48.430
But we're all weak, I think.

46:50.599 --> 46:52.226
But we're trying to be stronger.

46:53.143 --> 46:55.771
And the pain that we are feeling today...

46:57.481 --> 46:59.399
is to remind us every day...

47:02.444 --> 47:03.445
to do better.

47:05.322 --> 47:06.406
To be better.

47:11.954 --> 47:16.041
-[Zach] A few of us are going to Monet's.
-[Jess] I'm gonna head home, I think.

47:16.124 --> 47:17.334
I'm with my folks.

47:19.503 --> 47:21.004
[mournful music plays]

47:50.033 --> 47:52.578
[Clay] After the funeral, I couldn't move.

47:53.662 --> 47:54.830
Couldn't even stand.

47:55.330 --> 47:56.290
Stuck.

47:58.250 --> 47:59.626
This is my life now.

48:03.839 --> 48:06.717
[footsteps approaching]

48:09.636 --> 48:11.638
[mournful music continues]

48:38.540 --> 48:39.750
[Jess breathes shakily]

49:04.942 --> 49:05.984
Um... Can I...

49:06.944 --> 49:08.654
I just wanted to say...

49:10.113 --> 49:12.032
I think you saved my life too.

49:13.075 --> 49:14.284
More than anyone.

49:15.285 --> 49:16.411
So, thank you.

49:17.412 --> 49:19.623
And I was mean to you when you got back.

49:19.706 --> 49:22.542
I didn't even think
about everything you were going through.

49:23.251 --> 49:24.586
But anyway, I'm...

49:25.337 --> 49:26.380
I'm sorry.

49:26.880 --> 49:27.923
And thank you.

49:31.760 --> 49:32.761
Alex.

49:35.222 --> 49:36.223
I'm just...

49:37.140 --> 49:39.434
I'm just really happy
to be alive right now.

49:44.272 --> 49:45.190
[Ani] Yeah.

49:46.274 --> 49:47.275
Me too.

49:54.282 --> 49:55.742
[door opens, bell rings]

50:03.333 --> 50:04.292
Can we...

50:06.503 --> 50:07.629
Can we talk?

50:09.172 --> 50:10.048
Yeah.

50:12.759 --> 50:15.012
[Clay] And what if the past
follows us everywhere?

50:18.140 --> 50:19.891
What if we can never get away from it?

50:38.535 --> 50:39.661
Can I ask you,

50:41.246 --> 50:42.247
why'd you do it?

50:47.294 --> 50:48.670
Yeah. OK.

50:51.214 --> 50:54.843
Zach had hurt him pretty bad,
he'd broken his leg, his arm.

50:55.218 --> 50:58.138
He begged me to help him up, so I did.

50:59.097 --> 51:02.559
And then he started on
about how he was gonna ruin Zach's life,

51:03.101 --> 51:04.436
which he already had done.

51:05.854 --> 51:08.065
And he was just spewing all this shit.

51:08.690 --> 51:10.108
And I saw this...

51:11.068 --> 51:12.069
anger.

51:14.780 --> 51:17.240
I didn't see any soul or anything.

51:17.324 --> 51:18.325
I just didn't.

51:19.034 --> 51:24.873
And then I realized
that he had ruined everyone I ever loved.

51:26.374 --> 51:27.709
And I got this...

51:30.212 --> 51:32.881
this flash of rage.

51:33.965 --> 51:38.386
Ever since my TBI,
I get these flares, like, I go red.

51:39.638 --> 51:41.681
And then I pushed him off the dock.

51:49.481 --> 51:50.774
[Winston inhales sharply]

51:53.151 --> 51:54.486
Are you sorry you did it?

51:57.114 --> 51:58.949
More than I can ever say.

52:01.868 --> 52:03.328
Was Jessica with you?

52:04.538 --> 52:05.872
[tense music plays]

52:12.379 --> 52:14.131
[chuckles lightly]

52:19.719 --> 52:21.805
[sighs] Did you ever really like me?

52:25.058 --> 52:27.060
Yeah. Yes.

52:29.229 --> 52:31.606
You opened up a new world for me.

52:32.816 --> 52:35.569
You helped me figure out stuff
about myself.

52:35.652 --> 52:37.154
I loved being with you.

52:39.281 --> 52:40.574
[sighs]

52:42.284 --> 52:43.368
Yeah, me too.

52:46.705 --> 52:47.831
[Winston inhales shakily]

52:54.462 --> 52:55.755
[sighs heavily]

53:00.135 --> 53:01.553
I'm not gonna do anything.

53:05.265 --> 53:06.558
I thought I was...

53:08.643 --> 53:09.644
because...

53:09.728 --> 53:11.021
[inhales, exhales deeply]

53:11.771 --> 53:13.231
...because I loved Monty.

53:14.816 --> 53:16.109
I knew him somehow.

53:16.526 --> 53:17.569
I swear I did.

53:22.657 --> 53:23.909
But I loved you too.

53:26.661 --> 53:28.246
And I am trying not to...

53:29.623 --> 53:31.124
but I still fucking do.

53:35.712 --> 53:36.713
OK.

53:38.256 --> 53:39.257
Thank you.

53:41.760 --> 53:42.928
Can I hug you?

53:52.229 --> 53:53.438
[Winston sniffles]

54:23.843 --> 54:24.678
All right.

54:25.053 --> 54:29.099
It's done. The sales papers are drawn up.
All it needs is a buyer's signature.

54:29.182 --> 54:30.976
Tony, that's great.

54:31.810 --> 54:33.103
-Right?
-I don't know!

54:33.186 --> 54:35.480
I... I... I don't know if it's great!

54:35.563 --> 54:37.107
I don't know what to think!

54:37.190 --> 54:38.024
Fuck!

54:38.108 --> 54:41.069
Second thoughts are natural,
but this is a solid plan, Tony.

54:41.152 --> 54:42.237
This is safe.

54:42.320 --> 54:45.657
No plan in this fucking world
is safe, Caleb.

54:45.740 --> 54:47.784
Safe is not a word I believe in anymore.

54:47.867 --> 54:50.328
[Caleb] OK. OK.
But the garage is protected.

54:50.412 --> 54:52.914
This gives you a chance to...
to have a life.

54:53.623 --> 54:55.000
What if I like this life?

54:55.083 --> 54:57.294
What if I like this right now?

54:57.377 --> 54:58.628
The garage is protected.

54:58.712 --> 55:01.089
I mean, the buyer doesn't know shit
about fixing cars,

55:01.172 --> 55:02.799
but Javi's ready to manage the place.

55:02.882 --> 55:03.883
He does already.

55:03.967 --> 55:06.720
What if one of the businesses
takes a dive?

55:07.053 --> 55:09.139
What if it's too much
for one person to handle?

55:09.222 --> 55:11.891
Tony, I've lived with you
for more than a year.

55:11.975 --> 55:13.810
Nothing's too much for me to handle.

55:14.686 --> 55:15.603
Here.

55:19.232 --> 55:20.775
-Javi and I...
-[groans]

55:22.610 --> 55:23.945
...will take good care.

55:24.696 --> 55:27.073
What if I'm not good enough
to stay on the team?

55:27.157 --> 55:29.492
What if I flunk out?
I'm no good at school!

55:29.576 --> 55:31.453
You're good at anything
you wanna be good at.

55:31.536 --> 55:33.455
Oh, my God. This is so easy for you.

55:33.538 --> 55:36.166
-Why is this so fucking easy for you?
-It's not easy!

55:36.249 --> 55:37.625
This is fucking killing me.

55:38.418 --> 55:41.421
But this gives you a chance
to live a whole life.

55:41.504 --> 55:43.298
[inhales deeply, exhales]

55:43.381 --> 55:44.924
[shakily] What if I can't do it?

55:48.303 --> 55:50.055
I don't know. What if I'm lonely?

55:50.722 --> 55:52.766
Well, I'm eight hours away by car.

55:53.725 --> 55:55.602
Seven the way that you drive.

55:55.685 --> 55:57.187
[both chuckle]

55:57.270 --> 55:58.730
-[Tony sniffles]
-Here.

56:03.193 --> 56:04.736
Oh, fuck.

56:09.115 --> 56:10.158
I'm scared.

56:11.368 --> 56:12.369
I know.

56:14.037 --> 56:15.163
And that's OK.

56:18.083 --> 56:19.209
-OK.
-Yeah.

56:19.626 --> 56:20.794
Come here.

56:20.877 --> 56:21.836
It's OK.

56:26.049 --> 56:27.759
-It's OK, Tony.
-No.

56:27.842 --> 56:29.803
It's OK to be scared. I'm scared too.

56:30.553 --> 56:33.223
[Clay] What if what's ahead of us
is even more terrifying

56:33.306 --> 56:34.849
than what we've been through?

56:34.933 --> 56:35.934
OK.

56:36.393 --> 56:37.811
[breathes deeply]

56:37.894 --> 56:39.270
[keyboard clattering]

56:44.984 --> 56:45.860
You good?

56:46.277 --> 56:49.948
Yeah. I'm good. I'm just finishing up
these patrol reports.

56:50.490 --> 56:51.699
[Diaz] I was thinkin'.

56:52.659 --> 56:56.037
I always say that this job
is everything to me.

56:57.205 --> 56:58.498
I don't come from much.

56:59.290 --> 57:00.625
I know you don't either.

57:00.708 --> 57:04.754
No, sir. My two boys are the first
in my family to go to college.

57:05.213 --> 57:06.464
[Diaz] Same with my kids.

57:07.424 --> 57:10.093
And I say this job is everything,
but it's not true.

57:11.052 --> 57:14.556
I live my life for family,
for God, for country.

57:15.014 --> 57:16.015
In that order.

57:16.349 --> 57:18.601
And a father's love is a, uh...

57:19.644 --> 57:21.604
fierce and complicated thing.

57:22.021 --> 57:24.399
As I'm sure my daughter Valerie
would tell you.

57:25.567 --> 57:26.568
But family...

57:28.903 --> 57:30.071
Family comes first.

57:31.072 --> 57:32.073
Wouldn't you agree?

57:33.241 --> 57:34.242
I do.

57:35.618 --> 57:36.453
Hmm.

57:37.912 --> 57:38.913
[inhales slowly]

57:38.997 --> 57:40.832
The Bryce Walker files, um...

57:41.583 --> 57:43.626
they're going down to permanent storage.

57:46.671 --> 57:48.548
That case is closed for good.

57:54.804 --> 57:55.889
Understood.

58:00.852 --> 58:02.145
Don't work too late, Bill.

58:05.315 --> 58:06.357
[Bill] Hey, Sheriff.

58:09.569 --> 58:10.570
Thank you.

58:16.910 --> 58:17.911
[relieved sigh]

58:19.370 --> 58:20.371
[door closes]

58:24.209 --> 58:26.294
[Clay] How do we get on with our lives?

58:31.716 --> 58:32.759
Hey.

58:33.760 --> 58:35.345
You waited for me.

58:35.845 --> 58:37.305
Of course I waited for you.

58:39.557 --> 58:41.434
Um... Negative.

58:42.602 --> 58:43.520
Good.

58:44.062 --> 58:45.188
Yeah, me too.

58:46.523 --> 58:50.235
Um, thanks for telling me,
and coming with me.

58:50.610 --> 58:51.569
Of course.

58:52.320 --> 58:53.446
I wasn't worried.

58:53.863 --> 58:57.784
He'd never do it without protection.
He was pretty hardcore on that.

59:00.245 --> 59:02.455
They, uh... They tell you about PrEP?

59:03.623 --> 59:05.375
That seems like a good thing.

59:05.458 --> 59:06.417
Yeah.

59:06.793 --> 59:09.754
Though I don't plan on
having sex again, ever, so...

59:12.423 --> 59:13.758
Look, I'm sorry...

59:15.134 --> 59:16.427
about Justin. I...

59:17.887 --> 59:19.597
I know how much you loved him.

59:21.683 --> 59:23.017
How would you know that?

59:24.561 --> 59:25.562
I...

59:25.645 --> 59:27.397
I saw you dance together.

59:33.111 --> 59:33.945
And...

59:34.696 --> 59:35.822
a guy can tell...

59:36.698 --> 59:38.575
when a girl's heart is spoken for.

59:53.006 --> 59:54.132
I'm sorry...

59:54.549 --> 59:55.383
for...

59:56.134 --> 59:58.469
everything I put you through.

59:59.554 --> 1:00:01.222
I'm done with it. I just...

1:00:03.558 --> 1:00:04.892
I couldn't let it go.

1:00:07.020 --> 1:00:08.062
I... [breathes shakily]

1:00:08.146 --> 1:00:10.690
I miss Monty so much.

1:00:12.191 --> 1:00:13.192
But it...

1:00:13.901 --> 1:00:16.904
It can't be anything
like what you miss Justin.

1:00:17.739 --> 1:00:18.740
[Jess sighs]

1:00:19.699 --> 1:00:20.658
I don't know.

1:00:22.493 --> 1:00:23.745
Missing is missing.

1:00:29.917 --> 1:00:31.461
[chuckles lightly] I...

1:00:32.629 --> 1:00:37.216
I know it's very much too soon
to be saying anything like this, but...

1:00:38.217 --> 1:00:41.846
if you ever need someone
to miss people with,

1:00:41.929 --> 1:00:45.099
I would like to maybe
ask you out sometime.

1:00:45.808 --> 1:00:47.018
To go out with me.

1:00:48.311 --> 1:00:49.270
Again.

1:00:49.646 --> 1:00:51.898
But in a new way, sometime.

1:00:56.194 --> 1:00:58.696
Maybe I can...
Can I start asking in about a month?

1:01:00.615 --> 1:01:01.741
Maybe in a month.

1:01:04.452 --> 1:01:07.080
[Clay] How do we even imagine
starting something new?

1:01:09.499 --> 1:01:11.084
You'd think I'd know these answers.

1:01:12.335 --> 1:01:14.504
You'd think I'd be good at goodbyes
by now.

1:01:14.587 --> 1:01:16.297
[tense music plays]

1:01:31.396 --> 1:01:33.064
[tense music continues]

1:02:04.470 --> 1:02:05.972
[Clay] Mrs. Baker sent them.

1:02:07.515 --> 1:02:10.226
The court had returned them to her
after, like, months,

1:02:10.309 --> 1:02:12.854
and she thought
Tony and I should have them.

1:02:13.271 --> 1:02:14.772
That they were never hers.

1:02:15.231 --> 1:02:18.609
That they were something of Hannah
that we got, and she never would.

1:02:20.445 --> 1:02:23.448
-[Ellman] What do you think that was?
-I don't know.

1:02:24.532 --> 1:02:25.450
Think harder.

1:02:26.409 --> 1:02:27.410
I don't know.

1:02:28.494 --> 1:02:31.330
I think you do.
And I think you're being lazy.

1:02:32.874 --> 1:02:34.459
What the hell? Screw you!

1:02:34.542 --> 1:02:35.626
[Ellman] There we go.

1:02:36.169 --> 1:02:39.797
I was worried we'd have Mumbles McGee
for the whole session.

1:02:39.881 --> 1:02:40.798
[stutters]

1:02:40.882 --> 1:02:42.800
What the fuck is this? Tough love?

1:02:42.884 --> 1:02:43.968
Some shit like that?

1:02:45.470 --> 1:02:47.972
Why did Hannah's mother
send you the tapes?

1:02:49.307 --> 1:02:52.185
Why do you and Tony feel
so responsible for Tyler?

1:02:52.268 --> 1:02:55.313
Why did your graffiti say,
"Monty was framed"?

1:02:55.396 --> 1:02:56.481
Why do you care?

1:02:56.564 --> 1:02:59.108
-Because I care about you.
-You care about a paycheck.

1:02:59.192 --> 1:03:00.693
You think I only care 'cause I'm paid?

1:03:00.777 --> 1:03:02.570
Would you wanna see me
if the bill wasn't paid?

1:03:02.653 --> 1:03:03.654
If you needed me.

1:03:03.738 --> 1:03:04.739
Yeah, bullshit!

1:03:07.158 --> 1:03:08.743
What are you really asking, Clay?

1:03:09.494 --> 1:03:13.539
I'm not asking anything,
I'm just... I'm fucking fed up!

1:03:13.623 --> 1:03:15.416
Well, good. Why?

1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:18.753
Because! Because none
of this fucking matters! OK?

1:03:18.836 --> 1:03:20.630
If Justin is dead,

1:03:21.380 --> 1:03:23.424
then none of the rest of it matters!

1:03:27.220 --> 1:03:28.137
It's...

1:03:29.972 --> 1:03:31.682
[sobs] How could he let it happen?

1:03:31.766 --> 1:03:33.935
How could he let himself
get sick like that?

1:03:34.018 --> 1:03:36.646
We... It would've been so easy
to save him!

1:03:38.147 --> 1:03:42.318
[Ellman] Maybe deep down, he didn't think
he was worth saving or worth loving.

1:03:43.736 --> 1:03:45.530
But Jessica loved him.

1:03:45.613 --> 1:03:47.365
And my... my... my parents did.

1:03:47.740 --> 1:03:48.616
And I did!

1:03:48.699 --> 1:03:51.244
But what if there was some part of him
from a long time ago

1:03:51.327 --> 1:03:53.120
that couldn't let himself be loved?

1:03:53.830 --> 1:03:55.623
Couldn't let himself be cared for?

1:03:55.706 --> 1:03:57.959
That makes no sense!

1:03:58.042 --> 1:03:59.043
Really, Clay?

1:03:59.126 --> 1:04:02.922
You can't imagine a kid who keeps secrets
from the people who love him most?

1:04:03.005 --> 1:04:05.091
A kid who won't let himself be cared for?

1:04:06.759 --> 1:04:07.844
Fuck you.

1:04:10.471 --> 1:04:11.472
[Clay sighs]

1:04:33.119 --> 1:04:35.955
My Guild Starfire. I love that guitar.

1:04:39.667 --> 1:04:41.085
I grew up here, you know.

1:04:42.837 --> 1:04:43.838
In Evergreen.

1:04:46.382 --> 1:04:48.676
It was the late '60s and early '70s.

1:04:48.759 --> 1:04:51.262
It was a turbulent, difficult time.

1:04:51.929 --> 1:04:54.056
Country was desperately divided.

1:04:54.140 --> 1:04:55.766
Drugs were everywhere.

1:04:56.642 --> 1:04:58.102
I was a troubled kid.

1:04:59.937 --> 1:05:01.731
Yeah, I'm sure you were a hellion.

1:05:02.565 --> 1:05:03.691
I stole a car.

1:05:07.069 --> 1:05:08.779
So I could steal a guitar amp.

1:05:10.364 --> 1:05:11.490
I sniffed glue.

1:05:11.991 --> 1:05:13.159
Dropped acid.

1:05:13.576 --> 1:05:14.660
Smoked dope.

1:05:14.744 --> 1:05:16.078
Occasionally I sold it.

1:05:17.538 --> 1:05:18.372
Shit.

1:05:18.789 --> 1:05:20.791
[Ellman] I was going down a dark road,

1:05:20.875 --> 1:05:24.629
and then a teacher in my high school
saw something in me.

1:05:25.546 --> 1:05:26.505
Saw...

1:05:27.798 --> 1:05:28.633
me.

1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:31.761
She believed I had something to offer.

1:05:31.844 --> 1:05:34.055
She was an English teacher.

1:05:34.722 --> 1:05:36.223
She thought I could write.

1:05:36.307 --> 1:05:40.019
And I said something to her
very much like what you said to me.

1:05:41.145 --> 1:05:42.730
Nothing makes sense.

1:05:42.813 --> 1:05:44.523
None of the pieces fit together.

1:05:44.899 --> 1:05:46.192
And she said to me...

1:05:47.068 --> 1:05:47.902
"Try."

1:05:49.528 --> 1:05:50.529
She said...

1:05:53.032 --> 1:05:53.950
"Begin."

1:05:57.453 --> 1:05:58.621
So I began.

1:05:59.830 --> 1:06:04.418
And years later I found myself back here,
in my home town,

1:06:04.502 --> 1:06:06.170
to help kids like me.

1:06:08.422 --> 1:06:09.423
Like you.

1:06:10.758 --> 1:06:14.595
I can't promise
the story has a happy ending, Clay.

1:06:15.346 --> 1:06:16.889
What happens to us,

1:06:17.682 --> 1:06:20.184
it may only have the sense
that we make of it.

1:06:22.436 --> 1:06:26.190
But I do know
that it's in telling the story...

1:06:27.650 --> 1:06:29.276
that we learn who we are.

1:06:30.236 --> 1:06:32.780
And maybe see who we might become.

1:06:37.994 --> 1:06:38.995
[Clay sniffles]

1:06:48.212 --> 1:06:50.840
[breathes shakily]

1:07:15.031 --> 1:07:16.032
[clicks tongue]

1:07:18.993 --> 1:07:21.120
It starts with Hannah Baker.

1:07:25.916 --> 1:07:27.960
[Bolan] Graduation is that special time,

1:07:28.044 --> 1:07:31.547
not only to celebrate
but to acknowledge the hard work

1:07:31.630 --> 1:07:36.635
and the countless sacrifices it took
to transform dreams into reality.

1:07:37.053 --> 1:07:39.138
And let's not forget the fortitude

1:07:39.638 --> 1:07:42.016
to carry on in the face of adversity.

1:07:42.683 --> 1:07:44.560
This graduating class

1:07:44.643 --> 1:07:47.021
has shown a special kind of fortitude.

1:07:47.646 --> 1:07:49.023
I admire you all.

1:07:49.106 --> 1:07:50.483
You've been tested

1:07:51.025 --> 1:07:52.443
well beyond the classroom,

1:07:53.277 --> 1:07:54.737
and you have endured.

1:07:55.780 --> 1:07:57.990
Now, you may not believe me.

1:07:58.074 --> 1:07:59.450
Your... [chuckles]

1:07:59.992 --> 1:08:04.789
...class president and class speaker,
in particular, may not believe me.

1:08:05.790 --> 1:08:08.000
But all we have ever wished for,

1:08:08.459 --> 1:08:11.587
myself, the educators here today,

1:08:12.129 --> 1:08:13.255
all of your parents,

1:08:13.339 --> 1:08:15.925
all we have truly wished for

1:08:16.008 --> 1:08:20.304
is to see that you are all happy
and healthy and safe.

1:08:20.638 --> 1:08:22.556
This class, in particular,

1:08:23.099 --> 1:08:25.142
has made that hellishly hard.

1:08:25.226 --> 1:08:26.685
[laughter]

1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:31.690
But I have faith in you. [chuckles]

1:08:32.191 --> 1:08:33.359
All of you.

1:08:33.442 --> 1:08:35.694
And I hope that we have taught you well.

1:08:37.029 --> 1:08:38.864
I know you have taught me.

1:08:41.492 --> 1:08:42.535
I'm grateful.

1:08:43.953 --> 1:08:45.287
And I'm proud of you all.

1:08:45.621 --> 1:08:47.790
[cheering, whistling]

1:08:50.251 --> 1:08:51.836
[Jess] Look, here's the thing.

1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:54.713
There should be more of us here.

1:08:57.049 --> 1:09:00.010
And lately, I have been thinking about
why they're not here.

1:09:01.345 --> 1:09:04.807
I have a history of causing trouble
with my speeches.

1:09:05.724 --> 1:09:08.269
Principal Bolan
actually had to approve my speech

1:09:08.352 --> 1:09:10.146
just so I wouldn't make trouble.

1:09:11.856 --> 1:09:13.315
But that was a month ago.

1:09:14.358 --> 1:09:16.527
And my life has changed since then.

1:09:18.904 --> 1:09:22.992
But don't worry,
I'm not causing any trouble today.

1:09:25.244 --> 1:09:27.454
Because I just want you to hear me.

1:09:28.789 --> 1:09:31.167
Some of you circulated a petition
this year,

1:09:31.250 --> 1:09:33.377
demanding I be removed from office.

1:09:33.919 --> 1:09:35.504
Saying that I was a one-issue president,

1:09:35.588 --> 1:09:38.507
and I had made my point,
and I should just shut up.

1:09:38.591 --> 1:09:40.426
Well, no girls signed that petition.

1:09:40.509 --> 1:09:41.802
-[laughter]
-So, news, boys,

1:09:42.344 --> 1:09:43.971
our point is far from made.

1:09:44.555 --> 1:09:46.056
And we're not shutting up.

1:09:46.140 --> 1:09:47.474
-Yeah!
-[whistling]

1:09:49.643 --> 1:09:51.645
[whooping]

1:09:52.354 --> 1:09:54.773
[Jess] But you are right about one thing:

1:09:55.191 --> 1:09:56.901
I am a one-issue president.

1:09:58.569 --> 1:10:00.279
I'm a one-issue person.

1:10:01.864 --> 1:10:04.491
I spent the last couple of years angry.

1:10:05.576 --> 1:10:06.493
Hurt.

1:10:06.911 --> 1:10:07.912
Scared.

1:10:09.288 --> 1:10:11.081
But I'm not gonna do that anymore.

1:10:12.625 --> 1:10:15.252
I'm gonna focus on my one issue.

1:10:17.254 --> 1:10:18.380
Which is love.

1:10:18.464 --> 1:10:19.924
[laughter, jeering]

1:10:20.299 --> 1:10:23.594
Oh, what? Does talking about love
make you embarrassed?

1:10:24.345 --> 1:10:25.679
Is it girly? What?

1:10:26.472 --> 1:10:28.474
Because it's the thing.

1:10:29.475 --> 1:10:31.894
It's the only thing.

1:10:33.479 --> 1:10:34.813
It's easy to hate.

1:10:35.606 --> 1:10:37.066
It's easy to fear.

1:10:37.691 --> 1:10:39.652
It's goddamn hard to love.

1:10:41.028 --> 1:10:42.238
But it's not optional.

1:10:43.364 --> 1:10:44.573
It's essential.

1:10:47.743 --> 1:10:49.203
It's life or death.

1:10:50.663 --> 1:10:51.956
I challenge you.

1:10:52.456 --> 1:10:53.999
Love each other.

1:10:54.083 --> 1:10:55.084
Do it.

1:10:55.167 --> 1:10:56.710
Do it better.

1:10:56.794 --> 1:10:59.088
Now and every day.

1:11:00.130 --> 1:11:01.340
I love you all.

1:11:05.511 --> 1:11:07.346
Oh, and fuck the patriarchy.

1:11:07.763 --> 1:11:09.723
[cheering, whistling]

1:11:09.807 --> 1:11:11.684
[whooping]

1:11:13.519 --> 1:11:14.853
[raucous applause]

1:11:19.400 --> 1:11:21.318
[Clay] It comes down to one question.

1:11:23.362 --> 1:11:25.030
Will you survive high school?

1:11:25.698 --> 1:11:26.699
Will I survive?

1:11:28.409 --> 1:11:30.577
Because I know too many people who didn't.

1:11:44.133 --> 1:11:45.884
In the past two years,

1:11:48.470 --> 1:11:51.432
three people who I loved have died.

1:12:00.107 --> 1:12:02.359
And two... two other people...

1:12:02.443 --> 1:12:04.570
[sniffling] ...who I thought I hated,

1:12:05.195 --> 1:12:06.238
also died.

1:12:08.407 --> 1:12:10.743
But I learned that hate is too simple.

1:12:11.577 --> 1:12:12.536
Jessica's right.

1:12:12.619 --> 1:12:13.704
Hate is easy.

1:12:15.039 --> 1:12:17.791
Love and understanding are harder.

1:12:18.208 --> 1:12:20.753
But they are how we take care
of each other,

1:12:21.795 --> 1:12:23.047
how we survive.

1:12:24.590 --> 1:12:25.758
[sniffs]

1:12:31.555 --> 1:12:34.808
My dad loves to tell me stories
about when he was in high school.

1:12:36.977 --> 1:12:39.688
The stories usually involve chess club

1:12:39.772 --> 1:12:42.649
and obscure bands with funny haircuts,

1:12:42.733 --> 1:12:45.652
because the '80s were a strange,
strange time.

1:12:45.736 --> 1:12:47.279
[laughter]

1:12:49.448 --> 1:12:51.367
But he always gets one thing right.

1:12:55.371 --> 1:12:57.664
He knows high school can hurt.

that things will get better.

1:14:28.672 --> 1:14:30.591

maybe they won't.
