Well, that was a lot of fun.
Thanks for inviting us, guys.

00:38.541 --> 00:40.832
- Sure. You bet.
- Are you guys parked over here?

00:41.041 --> 00:42.915
Oh, no, no, no.
We -- We took a Handicar.

00:43.125 --> 00:44.165
It was easier that way.

00:44.375 --> 00:45.832
A Handicar?
What's that?

00:46.041 --> 00:46.957
You don't use Handicar?

00:47.166 --> 00:48.874
No, see, you just get
the Handicar app.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.415
It uses GPS
to locate where you are,

00:50.625 --> 00:52.040
and a Handicar comes
and picks you up.

00:52.250 --> 00:52.874
Wow.

00:53.083 --> 00:54.499
Yeah, and it's cheaper
than a taxi.

00:54.708 --> 00:56.832
I'm telling you, it's the future
of transportation.

00:57.041 --> 00:57.832
Oh, here it comes.

00:58.041 --> 00:59.790
Honey, our Handicar's here.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.665
Timmy!

01:01.875 --> 01:04.707
Have fun driving home.
I'll be relaxing on my iPad.

01:04.916 --> 01:07.207
- Lucky.
- Timmy!

01:07.416 --> 01:10.415
Download the app!
It works great!

01:20.000 --> 01:22.999
Uh, excuse me.
I think someone puked back here.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.999
You don't like puke?

01:25.208 --> 01:26.457
Could you turn
the radio down

01:26.666 --> 01:28.165
and the air-conditioning up,
please?

01:28.375 --> 01:30.499
No air-conditioning.
Too expensive.

01:31.875 --> 01:33.499
Aah!

01:33.708 --> 01:35.457
Not enough people taking cab.

01:35.666 --> 01:36.832
Don't know what's wrong.

01:37.041 --> 01:38.499
Timmy!

01:43.541 --> 01:45.415
What the fuck?

01:47.458 --> 01:50.457
We got a big sales event
going on, folks!

01:50.666 --> 01:51.582
Hey, guys!

01:51.791 --> 01:54.332
Can I get you
in a 2014 Hummer?

01:54.541 --> 01:57.040
Rocktober sales event, guys!

01:57.250 --> 01:58.207
No, thanks.

01:58.416 --> 02:00.582
Only a few more
guitar licks left

02:00.791 --> 02:01.957
in Rocktober, guys!

02:02.166 --> 02:03.457
We're good!
Shut up!

02:03.666 --> 02:05.415
Oh, here's our Handicar.

02:05.625 --> 02:06.665
Timmy!

02:11.625 --> 02:13.290
What the fuck?

02:13.500 --> 02:15.999
All right, kids, you know
what time of year it is?

02:16.208 --> 02:17.790
That's right.
It's autumn.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.290
And that means
our fund-raising

02:19.500 --> 02:21.415
for next year's summer camp
is in full gear.

02:21.625 --> 02:23.624
Is everyone psyched
for next year's summer camp?

02:25.291 --> 02:28.374
So far,
Jimmy has raised $16!

02:29.958 --> 02:32.249
Francis has raised $29.32.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.832
And Timmy has raised $2,063!

02:38.041 --> 02:39.915
Timmy!

02:40.125 --> 02:41.790
All righty,
if you guys keep this up,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.082
we'll raise the money
for summer camp in no time!

02:50.958 --> 02:52.582
I won't do it, Mimsy.

02:52.791 --> 02:56.124
I won't spend another summer
at that stupid camp.

02:56.333 --> 02:58.249
Derr, we don't like camp,
boss?

02:58.458 --> 02:59.624
We hate camp, Mimsy.

02:59.833 --> 03:01.749
The singing,
the competitions,

03:01.958 --> 03:04.207
Jimmy Valmer
getting all the chicks.

03:04.416 --> 03:06.415
Oh, yeah, and don't forget
last year at summer camp,

03:06.625 --> 03:07.624
you got raped by a shark.

03:07.833 --> 03:08.915
Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha!

03:09.125 --> 03:10.665
Shut up, Mimsy!

03:10.875 --> 03:13.665
I'm not gonna spend
my summer trapped at camp

03:13.875 --> 03:16.207
with these
punch-happy assholes.

03:16.416 --> 03:17.790
We got to find a way

03:18.000 --> 03:21.040
to put Handicar
out of business and fast.

03:21.250 --> 03:23.165
Oh, boy, we're gonna wreck
Timmy's business, huh, boss?

03:23.375 --> 03:24.165
Shh, shh!

03:24.375 --> 03:27.499
Hey, boys. Are you excited
for camp next year?

03:27.708 --> 03:30.915
Yes, Counselor Steve.
We like the tug of war.

03:31.125 --> 03:34.582
All right, well, just keep
working on those donations.

03:34.791 --> 03:35.749
Come on, Mimsy.

03:35.958 --> 03:38.499
We got to figure out
how we're gonna make Handicar

03:38.708 --> 03:40.332
a thing of the past.

03:40.541 --> 03:42.290
Oh, boy!

03:44.083 --> 03:45.874
We are united as brothers

03:46.083 --> 03:48.540
because just as Handicar's
taken away jobs

03:48.750 --> 03:51.040
from honest, hardworking
cab drivers,

03:51.250 --> 03:53.457
it's also taking food
from the mouths

03:53.666 --> 03:55.165
of the children
of car salesmen!

03:55.375 --> 03:56.999
I don't have any children.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.999
Who does this handicapped boy
think he is?

04:00.208 --> 04:01.707
He's not even in union.

04:01.916 --> 04:03.124
He's taking
all our business

04:03.333 --> 04:05.249
because people find it
more convenient!

04:05.458 --> 04:07.249
And because he's handicapped,

04:07.458 --> 04:10.374
he can use special access points
and parking spaces.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.915
That kid was born
with an unfair advantage!

04:13.125 --> 04:14.124
Who is this rat?

04:14.333 --> 04:16.082
His name is Timmy Burch.

04:16.291 --> 04:19.457
And if you don't
do something quick,

04:19.666 --> 04:22.124
you're all gonna be
out of work for good.

04:22.333 --> 04:23.165
Who are you?

04:23.375 --> 04:25.290
Just someone
who doesn't like to see

04:25.500 --> 04:28.624
hard workers like yourselves
lose their jobs, that's all.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.165
Nobody takes jobs
away from us!

04:31.375 --> 04:32.832
We need to speak to mayor

04:33.041 --> 04:36.415
and tell her to shut down
this illegitimate business.

04:36.625 --> 04:38.749
Or maybe we could have
the police shut him down.

04:38.958 --> 04:40.540
Hey, I got an idea!

04:40.750 --> 04:41.624
Why don't you guys

04:41.833 --> 04:43.707
just make your cars
cleaner and nicer

04:43.916 --> 04:45.874
and try to be
better to your customers

04:46.083 --> 04:47.124
so that you can compete

04:47.333 --> 04:50.749
with Handicar's popularity
in the marketplace?

04:50.958 --> 04:54.290
Just ignore my friend.
He's mentally disabled.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.915
Oh, yeah.
Don't mind me.

04:56.125 --> 04:57.707
Now, listen, everybody.

04:57.916 --> 04:59.624
If you're a sheep herder

04:59.833 --> 05:02.540
and there's a snake
taking away your sheep,

05:02.750 --> 05:04.665
what do you do
to the snake?

05:04.875 --> 05:08.582
Offer it last year's
Christmas in Rocksummer prices?

05:08.791 --> 05:12.999
No, you fucking moron.
You kill the snake.

05:21.416 --> 05:23.415
Timmy, Timmy.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.540
Timmy, Timmy.

05:26.583 --> 05:28.749
Timmy, Timmy, Timmy.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.874
Hey, wake up, you little scab.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.499
T-T-Timmy?

05:35.708 --> 05:39.665
We got a message for ya
from the union.

05:45.041 --> 05:46.999
Just imagine it, Mimsy --

05:47.208 --> 05:49.707
a whole summer to ourselves
to do what we want.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.832
It's going to be awesome.

05:53.708 --> 05:55.332
Well, well.
Hello, gentlemen.

05:55.541 --> 05:58.665
I understand you've taken care
of our little problem?

05:58.875 --> 06:00.165
Yeah, we sure did.

06:00.375 --> 06:02.707
Let's just say
he'll be laid up awhile.

06:02.916 --> 06:05.165
Yeah, we snuck in his room
last night,

06:05.375 --> 06:07.874
and we broke his legs.

06:08.083 --> 06:10.374
Oh, boy, that's gr--
Wait, you what?

06:10.583 --> 06:11.499
Timmy!

06:11.708 --> 06:12.999
♪ I am Lorde ♪

06:13.208 --> 06:14.540
♪ Lordy, Lordy, Lorde ♪

06:14.750 --> 06:17.499
But we broke his legs.
Both of them!

06:17.708 --> 06:20.415
Let me give you guys
a hot news flash.

06:20.625 --> 06:23.207
If you want to hurt
a crippled kid,

06:23.416 --> 06:26.707
you don't break
his fucking legs!

06:26.916 --> 06:29.999
How can people be
so ineffectual, Mimsy?

06:30.208 --> 06:31.207
Derr, I don't know, boss.

06:31.416 --> 06:33.040
These are supposed
to be men

06:33.250 --> 06:35.124
who care about
their occupation.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.832
Maybe if they're
that incompetent,

06:37.041 --> 06:38.874
we shouldn't be trying
to save their jobs.

06:39.083 --> 06:41.790
Maybe Handicar's a kind of
economic natural selection,

06:42.000 --> 06:42.957
where the more diligent workers

06:43.166 --> 06:44.624
are weeding out
the useless ones.

06:44.833 --> 06:45.874
Derr!

06:47.250 --> 06:48.957
Shut up, Mimsy!

06:50.250 --> 06:52.082
Right here is good.
Thank you.

06:52.291 --> 06:53.999
I can just use the app
to tip you, right?

06:54.208 --> 06:54.957
Timmy!

06:55.166 --> 06:57.540
Oh, this is so handy.
Thank you.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.374
Timmy.

07:00.583 --> 07:02.874
- Timmy, Timmy.
- Hey, Timmy.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.582
It's your friend from camp,
Nathan.

07:04.791 --> 07:05.749
Timmy!

07:05.958 --> 07:07.790
Listen,
you can't possibly handle

07:08.000 --> 07:09.415
all this business
you're getting.

07:09.625 --> 07:10.540
Admit it.

07:10.750 --> 07:13.040
You've got more customers
than you can handle.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.915
Timmy.

07:15.125 --> 07:16.790
I've got an amazing idea.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.165
Why don't you let other people
drive Handicars, too?

07:20.375 --> 07:22.582
Think of all the money
you could raise for camp

07:22.791 --> 07:24.207
if you expand your business.

07:24.416 --> 07:26.124
Hmm. Timmy.

07:26.333 --> 07:29.124
I'm sure you could find
a lot of interested drivers.

07:29.333 --> 07:31.207
Timmy.

07:31.416 --> 07:34.040
That's great.
Summer camp, here we come.

07:35.625 --> 07:38.332
Now kiss your business goodbye,
asshole.

07:40.291 --> 07:43.040
Derr, I don't get it, boss.
I thought you hated Handicar.

07:43.250 --> 07:44.957
How's come now
you want to work for him?

07:45.166 --> 07:46.749
It's very simple, Mimsy.

07:46.958 --> 07:49.790
I'm gonna take down Handicar
by being an employee

07:50.000 --> 07:52.249
who sexually harasses
the passengers.

07:52.458 --> 07:55.332
- Derr, sexual harassment, boss?
- It's simple.

07:55.541 --> 07:56.874
If you're a sheep herder

07:57.083 --> 07:59.124
and a snake
is killing your sheep,

07:59.333 --> 08:00.749
you just need
to have the snake

08:00.958 --> 08:02.665
get sued
for sexual misconduct.

08:02.875 --> 08:06.082
Now, you find me a female
passenger on that app

08:06.291 --> 08:07.665
and leave the rest to me.

08:07.875 --> 08:09.540
Derr, oh, boy!

08:16.416 --> 08:18.124
Timmy.

08:18.333 --> 08:21.165
Hello, ma'am.
Handicar at your service.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.457
Climb on in.

08:23.916 --> 08:26.749
So, let me
ask you a question.

08:26.958 --> 08:30.540
Would you like
to see my dick?

08:31.875 --> 08:33.915
Sure.
Would you like to see mine?

08:34.125 --> 08:36.040
Uh-oh!

08:36.250 --> 08:37.749
Mimsy!

08:37.958 --> 08:40.624
Aah! Aah! Mimsy!

08:45.750 --> 08:48.290
And I thought
a shark was bad.

08:52.750 --> 08:53.540
Come on, honey.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.999
It says our Handicar
is just pulling up.

08:56.208 --> 08:57.124
Timmy.

08:57.333 --> 08:58.624
Oh, hi, Gerald, Sheila.

08:58.833 --> 09:00.332
Steven?
What are you doing?

09:00.541 --> 09:02.665
You didn't know? Anyone can be
a Handicar driver now.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.582
All you have to do
is get your own wheelchair,

09:04.791 --> 09:05.957
and you can earn a Handicap.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.124
I've had my Handicap
for about three days now.

09:08.333 --> 09:09.124
Get on in.

09:11.291 --> 09:12.915
I'm telling you, Gerald,
having a Handicap

09:13.125 --> 09:14.874
is a great way to make
some money on the side.

09:15.083 --> 09:15.957
Timmy!

09:16.166 --> 09:18.207
- Timmy!
- Timmy!

09:18.416 --> 09:20.999
The world of transportation
is really changing, Gerald.

09:22.750 --> 09:24.749
Derr, gee, your idea
to have Handicar expand

09:24.958 --> 09:25.874
really worked, boss.

09:26.083 --> 09:27.582
Excuse me.
Out of my way, please.

09:27.791 --> 09:29.165
I have a Handicap.

09:29.375 --> 09:30.540
I had a handicap

09:30.750 --> 09:33.457
way before you got paid
to have one!

09:33.666 --> 09:36.082
Ha! You sound like that
Matthew McConaughey guy.

09:36.291 --> 09:37.457
Derr, "I drove a Lincoln

09:37.666 --> 09:39.165
way before I got paid
to drive one."

09:39.375 --> 09:40.457
Derr!

09:40.666 --> 09:42.957
Shut up, Mimsy!

09:45.791 --> 09:47.290
For the past eight years,

09:47.500 --> 09:48.790
Tesla has been
the leading innovator

09:49.000 --> 09:50.874
in the world
of automotive transport.

09:51.083 --> 09:55.957
And now the president and CEO
of Tesla Motorcars, Elon Musk.

10:00.541 --> 10:04.290
Today I am proud to announce
the Tesla D,

10:04.500 --> 10:06.415
the most innovative
and efficient,

10:06.625 --> 10:09.374
world-friendly mode
of transportation ever created.

10:09.583 --> 10:10.582
Any questions?

10:10.791 --> 10:13.499
Yes, uh, what about Handicar?

10:13.708 --> 10:14.415
What about it?

10:14.625 --> 10:15.540
Well, all over the country,

10:15.750 --> 10:17.749
people are realizing
that using an app to ride-share

10:17.958 --> 10:20.040
is even more convenient
and eco-friendly

10:20.250 --> 10:21.082
than electric cars.

10:21.291 --> 10:22.290
How do you intend to compete

10:22.500 --> 10:24.249
with this boy genius
in Colorado?

10:25.583 --> 10:29.624
I am so sick of hearing
about app-based ride-sharing!

10:29.833 --> 10:32.207
The future of transportation
is the electric car,

10:32.416 --> 10:33.582
not wheelchairs!

10:33.791 --> 10:34.582
Don't worry, Elon.

10:34.791 --> 10:36.249
Handicar is just
a small company.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.707
Oh, sure, operating
in a few small towns.

10:38.916 --> 10:40.874
But when they start absorbing
the taxi markets,

10:41.083 --> 10:43.082
bringing taxi service
to any part of the world,

10:43.291 --> 10:45.290
driving your kids
to and from school,

10:45.500 --> 10:47.290
delivering both
people and things?

10:47.500 --> 10:50.790
We can't compete with Handicar.
It's just so damn handy!

10:51.000 --> 10:51.957
If there is a way

10:52.166 --> 10:54.124
to reduce Handicar's
positive publicity,

10:54.333 --> 10:55.749
then we need to do it now.

10:55.958 --> 10:58.707
And you -- You say
it's theoretically possible?

10:58.916 --> 11:01.624
Of course.
It's very simple.

11:01.833 --> 11:03.249
If you're a sheep herder

11:03.458 --> 11:05.249
and a snake is killing
all your sheep,

11:05.458 --> 11:07.749
how do you
get rid of the snake?

11:08.500 --> 11:09.915
Who's the sheep herder?

11:10.125 --> 11:11.457
You are.

11:11.666 --> 11:12.999
Who's the snake?

11:13.208 --> 11:14.790
Handicar.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.290
Derr, it's an analogy!

11:18.500 --> 11:19.540
Shut up, Mimsy!

11:19.750 --> 11:20.999
If you're a sheep herder

11:21.208 --> 11:22.874
and a snake
is killing your sheep,

11:23.083 --> 11:23.957
all you have to do

11:24.166 --> 11:25.999
is prove to the sheep
that the snake

11:26.208 --> 11:29.957
is a completely
inferior entity.

11:34.958 --> 11:37.374
- Timmy!
- Timmy!

11:40.291 --> 11:42.124
Hey, Timmy.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.457
How is the fund-raising
for camp going?

11:44.666 --> 11:46.332
- Timmy!
- That's great.

11:46.541 --> 11:48.249
I can't wait
for camp this year.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.540
We are doing
some fund-raising, too.

11:50.750 --> 11:53.624
Have you heard of my friend,
Elon Musk, from Tesla?

11:53.833 --> 11:55.124
Good day to you.

11:55.333 --> 11:56.124
Timmy!

11:56.333 --> 11:57.874
Hey, how would you
like to have

11:58.083 --> 11:59.332
a friendly little race?

11:59.541 --> 12:00.749
It would be great publicity

12:00.958 --> 12:02.915
for your fund-raising
and for ours.

12:03.125 --> 12:05.915
Derr, we're gonna get Timmy
killed in the race, huh, boss?

12:06.125 --> 12:07.707
Shut up, Mimsy!

12:07.916 --> 12:10.999
What do you say, Timmy?
A friendly race this Saturday?

12:11.208 --> 12:13.457
We'll see you
at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.999
Hey, everyone!
You need to see this!

12:29.208 --> 12:31.415
What started
as a simple contest

12:31.625 --> 12:34.082
is quickly escalating
into an international crisis.

12:34.291 --> 12:36.707
As electronic cars challenge
the oil industry

12:36.916 --> 12:39.124
and transportation alternatives
fight for dominance,

12:39.333 --> 12:41.290
the unavoidable outcome
may be a conflict

12:41.500 --> 12:43.790
the likes the world
has not seen since the '70s.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.915
It appears that the world
is once again on the brink

12:47.125 --> 12:49.082
of Wacky Races.

12:49.291 --> 12:51.165
Wacky Races?
Holy shit!

12:51.375 --> 12:53.207
The prime minister of Japan
has insisted

12:53.416 --> 12:55.582
that any race would break
the Treaty of Salzburg,

12:55.791 --> 12:57.790
which called for a cease-fire
to the Wacky Races

12:58.000 --> 12:59.165
for their senseless brutality.

12:59.375 --> 13:01.374
They also claim that
if a race does take place,

13:01.583 --> 13:02.540
they would have no choice

13:02.750 --> 13:05.165
but to enter their completely
self-driven prototype Lexus

13:05.375 --> 13:06.415
into the conflict.

13:06.625 --> 13:07.915
The Canadians and Chinese
are also saying

13:08.125 --> 13:09.374
they would be forced to race,

13:09.583 --> 13:12.082
and no one yet has heard
from Dick Dastardly or Muttley.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.499
Unless a miracle happens,
this Saturday morning

13:14.708 --> 13:16.749
the world will witness
the first Wacky Races

13:16.958 --> 13:19.290
in nearly 50 years.

13:19.500 --> 13:22.624
Wacky Races are on!
Wacky Races are back on!

13:22.833 --> 13:24.957
Oh, my God,
Wacky Races are back on!

13:25.166 --> 13:27.749
Randy, they're bringing back
Wacky Races Saturday morning!

13:27.958 --> 13:29.665
I know! Are we watching
at your house?

13:29.875 --> 13:32.165
That's it, everyone!
We're out of cereal!

13:32.375 --> 13:34.665
- No! I didn't get any!
- That guy has two!

13:34.875 --> 13:37.165
I'm sorry, there's none left,
don't you understand?!

13:37.375 --> 13:38.957
Don't you see
what they're doing?

13:39.166 --> 13:40.832
This is just another example
of corporations

13:41.041 --> 13:43.207
trying to keep down people
with Handicaps.

13:43.416 --> 13:44.249
Don't do the race.

13:44.458 --> 13:46.040
You don't have to
prove anything.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.665
He has to do it.
Don't you see?

13:47.875 --> 13:49.582
He has people
that are depending on him

13:49.791 --> 13:51.332
to raise as much money
as possible.

13:51.541 --> 13:54.040
There are hundreds of people
with Handicaps now.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.457
Timmy.

13:55.666 --> 13:56.874
But isn't that the problem?

13:57.083 --> 13:57.999
I mean, let's face it.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.624
It's not like he's able
to keep the driver quality up.

14:00.833 --> 14:02.332
Anyone can have
a Handicap now.

14:02.541 --> 14:04.207
I mean,
even Matthew McConaughey's

14:04.416 --> 14:06.207
a Handicar driver,
for Christ's sake.

14:06.416 --> 14:07.624
McCONAUGHEY: Hey...

14:09.166 --> 14:12.332
I was driving a Handicar

14:12.541 --> 14:15.832
way before I got paid
to drive one.

14:17.125 --> 14:20.540
I just like how it feels.

14:20.750 --> 14:21.749
Look, the point is

14:21.958 --> 14:25.082
that this is your opportunity
to make Handicar -- Oop, sorry.

14:25.291 --> 14:26.874
Hold on. Sorry.
I went too far.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.999
This is your opportunity
to make Handicar

14:29.208 --> 14:31.374
the transportation
of the future.

14:31.583 --> 14:34.415
Think what you could do
with all that money.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.165
And here they are,

14:38.375 --> 14:40.374
the most daredevil group
of shared-ride drivers

14:40.583 --> 14:42.832
to ever whirl their wheels,
in the Wacky Races,

14:43.041 --> 14:46.124
competing for the title of
the future of transportation.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.207
Cars are approaching
the starting line.

14:48.416 --> 14:50.082
First off is the Lyft car,

14:50.291 --> 14:52.624
a ride-sharing company
out of San Francisco.

14:52.833 --> 14:54.374
Next up is the Zipcar,

14:54.583 --> 14:57.707
a pay-by-the-hour concept
based on Chinese bicycles.

14:57.916 --> 14:59.040
Maneuvering for position

14:59.250 --> 15:01.749
is a standard taxicab
driven by an angry Russian.

15:01.958 --> 15:03.665
Right behind
is a Hummer salesman

15:03.875 --> 15:05.790
in his 2014 Hummer No Class.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.540
And there's ingenious inventor
Elon Musk in his new Tesla D.

15:09.750 --> 15:12.499
Oh, and here's the lovely
Canadian actress Neve Campbell

15:12.708 --> 15:14.374
in the Canadian concept vehicle
the Queef,

15:14.583 --> 15:16.749
powered completely
on female natural gas.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.665
Next we have the Handicar
with Timmy Burch,

15:19.875 --> 15:22.249
and there's the completely
automated self-driving car

15:22.458 --> 15:23.249
from Japan.

15:23.458 --> 15:24.249
Limping along last

15:24.458 --> 15:25.999
are those
double-dealing do-badders,

15:26.208 --> 15:28.415
Dick Dastardly
and his sidekick, Muttley.

15:29.791 --> 15:33.124
And away they go
on the way-out Wacky Races.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.749
And this live coverage
of the event

15:34.958 --> 15:37.290
will be broadcast all morning,
of course, on CNN.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.040
Jesus. It's begun.

15:39.250 --> 15:40.582
God help them all.

15:40.791 --> 15:41.915
All I know is,

15:42.125 --> 15:44.707
if Dastardly and Muttley
are up to their old tricks,

15:44.916 --> 15:47.624
there's gonna be
a lot of violence today.

15:49.958 --> 15:52.290
You are watching BBC World.

15:52.500 --> 15:55.582
The violent conflict
over transport is under way,

15:55.791 --> 15:58.957
and it is even more senseless
and vile than many remember.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.082
We return you now

16:00.291 --> 16:03.124
to our live coverage
of the Wacky Races.

16:06.458 --> 16:08.957
As the Wacky Racers
roll down the roadway,

16:09.166 --> 16:11.124
we see that the taxicab
is in the lead,

16:11.333 --> 16:13.374
with Handicar
pulling up the rear.

16:13.583 --> 16:14.915
Timmy!

16:15.125 --> 16:17.124
All the cars
must follow the same route.

16:17.333 --> 16:18.874
First they'll leave
the town of South Park,

16:19.083 --> 16:20.540
then navigate
through Giggling Gulch

16:20.750 --> 16:22.582
on the final stretch
to pick up the passenger,

16:22.791 --> 16:24.082
a Miss Dotty Applegate.

16:24.291 --> 16:25.499
Once the passenger
is picked up,

16:25.708 --> 16:27.249
the vehicle must
successfully deliver her

16:27.458 --> 16:28.332
to the destination point

16:28.541 --> 16:29.790
at her daughter's house
in Morrison.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.082
It looks like the Zipcar

16:31.291 --> 16:33.374
is trying to vie for position
past the Hummer vehicle.

16:33.583 --> 16:35.040
It's neck and neck
as the Wacky Racers

16:35.250 --> 16:37.665
all push to be first
to pick up the passenger.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.374
Miss Applegate
is waiting patiently.

16:41.583 --> 16:45.165
And Elon Musk's Tesla
appears to take the lead.

16:45.375 --> 16:46.165
Slow down!

16:46.375 --> 16:48.332
I need Timmy to pick up
the passenger before we do.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.790
But I thought we wanted Handicar
to lose the race!

16:52.000 --> 16:53.707
He can't just lose the race.

16:53.916 --> 16:56.207
He has to get sued
and lose the whole business.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.332
That's why,
when he gets the passenger,

16:58.541 --> 17:00.832
I've got a little surprise
waiting for him.

17:01.041 --> 17:03.832
Hey, boss, it seems like every
time you come up with a plan,

17:04.041 --> 17:05.332
it kind of backfires on you.

17:05.541 --> 17:07.915
If you really don't want
to go to summer camp so bad,

17:08.125 --> 17:09.832
why don't you just tell
your parents how you feel?

17:10.041 --> 17:11.790
You know, tell them
you don't want to go,

17:12.000 --> 17:13.499
and just see how they react.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.457
Wait, wait.
I got it.

17:16.666 --> 17:18.832
Shut up, Mimsy!

17:19.041 --> 17:20.499
- Hey, Mimsy.
- Yeah?

17:20.708 --> 17:22.124
Shut up!

17:22.333 --> 17:25.207
The Canadian car
overtakes the self-driving car.

17:25.416 --> 17:26.957
And now here comes the Zipcar,

17:27.166 --> 17:29.707
which is being driven
by Matthew McConaughey.

17:32.250 --> 17:35.332
I was driving a Zipcar

17:35.541 --> 17:38.790
way before I got paid
to drive one.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.832
And look at this --
the Lyft car is

17:41.041 --> 17:43.124
the first to arrive
and pick up the passenger.

17:44.375 --> 17:45.957
Now the Lyft car
must take the passenger

17:46.166 --> 17:47.999
to her destination,
but look at this.

17:48.208 --> 17:51.165
The Hummer salesman is running
the Lyft car off the road.

17:51.375 --> 17:53.707
And the Hummer salesman is
taking the passenger to the car,

17:53.916 --> 17:55.624
and he is going to
let her drive herself.

17:56.958 --> 17:59.082
You've got
a fully automated sound system,

17:59.291 --> 18:00.790
and your sunroof
is operated right here.

18:01.000 --> 18:01.915
What do you think, huh?

18:02.125 --> 18:03.832
Can you see yourself
in one of these puppies?

18:04.041 --> 18:06.749
Elon Musk is using
one of his kooky inventions

18:06.958 --> 18:08.582
to put the Hummer
out of commission for good.

18:10.333 --> 18:12.582
- Oh, God!
- Jesus! Did you see that? Oh!

18:12.791 --> 18:15.415
The passenger is
being taken to the Tesla D now.

18:16.791 --> 18:17.415
No, wait.

18:17.625 --> 18:18.415
She just got snatched

18:18.625 --> 18:20.749
by the pissed-off Russian
in his taxi.

18:20.958 --> 18:23.082
Miss Applegate is now
in the back of the taxi,

18:23.291 --> 18:25.707
and she's being forced
to watch Jimmy Fallon.

18:25.916 --> 18:27.082
Uh-oh.

18:27.291 --> 18:30.040
The Canadian car's
completely run out of queefs.

18:31.625 --> 18:32.915
With the race nearly over,

18:33.125 --> 18:35.457
it's the taxi out in front,
followed by self-driving car,

18:35.666 --> 18:37.665
and then pulling up in third
is Handicar.

18:37.875 --> 18:39.165
Timmy!

18:39.375 --> 18:41.124
It's gonna be a close one.

18:41.333 --> 18:43.249
Not too close, Boopsie.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.249
Oh, no -- Dick Dastardly

18:46.458 --> 18:47.915
is up to no-do-goodery again.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.165
Oh! Oh! Dude!

18:55.291 --> 18:56.082
- Oh!
- Oh, dude!

18:56.291 --> 18:57.582
- Boom!
- Boom!

18:57.791 --> 19:01.082
And there's Handicar
to pick Mrs. Applegate up!

19:02.291 --> 19:04.374
That's it.
Handicar has the passenger.

19:04.583 --> 19:07.832
We're almost in range.
Another 100 feet.

19:08.041 --> 19:08.957
Wait a minute.

19:09.166 --> 19:10.665
What the hell
are all those cars?

19:12.041 --> 19:13.082
Holy shit!

19:13.291 --> 19:16.040
Timmy!

19:16.583 --> 19:18.707
Timmy!

19:18.916 --> 19:19.915
Aah!

19:20.125 --> 19:21.665
Liv-a-la!
Timmy!

19:21.875 --> 19:23.290
We're near the finish line.

19:23.500 --> 19:24.874
The race is almost over.

19:25.083 --> 19:26.415
Handicar is in the lead,

19:26.625 --> 19:28.040
still way out in front
of the Zipcar

19:28.250 --> 19:29.874
driven by Matthew McConaughey.

19:32.541 --> 19:37.290
Sometimes you got to go forward
by going backward.

19:37.500 --> 19:41.874
Are we driving cars,
or are cars driving us?

19:42.083 --> 19:43.999
The Dastardly car
is racing past both.

19:44.208 --> 19:45.790
This could be an upset, folks.

19:48.583 --> 19:49.499
Timmy!

19:49.708 --> 19:51.790
Good night,
you son of a bitch.

19:55.375 --> 19:57.832
Mimsy, I told you
to put the explosives

19:58.041 --> 19:58.957
under Timmy's seat!

19:59.166 --> 20:00.582
Derr, you told me
to put the explosives

20:00.791 --> 20:02.915
under the seat of that fake,
soft-spoken douche bag

20:03.125 --> 20:04.124
that everyone loves!

20:04.333 --> 20:06.499
Not that fake,
soft-spoken douche bag

20:06.708 --> 20:07.874
that everyone loves!

20:08.083 --> 20:09.124
Oh, my.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.457
It appears that an explosion
has opened up a wormhole

20:11.666 --> 20:13.332
with Matthew McConaughey inside.

20:13.541 --> 20:16.374
Mimsy...

20:17.416 --> 20:18.540
And there's the finish.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.207
It looks like Handicar
has done it.

20:20.416 --> 20:21.415
Timmy!

20:25.250 --> 20:28.207
A big congratulations
to our fund-raising champion.

20:28.416 --> 20:31.040
After selling the Handicar
rights to Elon Musk,

20:31.250 --> 20:35.082
Timmy has raised $2.3 billion
for summer camp.

20:36.875 --> 20:37.957
Great job to all of you.

20:38.166 --> 20:40.624
This is sure to be
the best summer camp ever!

20:44.375 --> 20:45.624
All set for bed, honey?

20:45.833 --> 20:47.915
Yeah, I like to sleep
at nighttime!

20:48.125 --> 20:50.207
All right.
Good night.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.040
Wait.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.082
Wait. Mom?

20:55.291 --> 20:56.207
Can we talk?

20:56.416 --> 20:59.040
Um, yes.
O-Of course.

20:59.250 --> 21:01.582
This is very difficult, Mom.

21:01.791 --> 21:03.207
But, um...

21:03.416 --> 21:06.499
You know how every year
I go to summer camp?

21:06.708 --> 21:08.999
Well, I hate it.

21:09.208 --> 21:12.999
I hate it, and I don't want
to go anymore.

21:13.208 --> 21:14.957
I'm sorry.
I can't understand you, honey.

21:15.166 --> 21:16.207
You're handicapped.

21:16.416 --> 21:17.999
What's to understand?

21:18.208 --> 21:19.582
I'm telling you
I don't want to go

21:19.791 --> 21:21.790
to that stupid camp anymore!

21:22.000 --> 21:24.207
You want water?
Is that what you want?

21:24.416 --> 21:26.540
No!
I don't want to go to camp!

21:26.750 --> 21:29.374
Oh, yes. Okay, honey.
I'll turn off the lamp.

21:30.708 --> 21:31.415
No!

21:31.625 --> 21:33.207
That's not
what I fucking said!

21:33.416 --> 21:35.124
Goddamn it!
Now I can't even see!

21:35.333 --> 21:36.665
Ow!

21:36.875 --> 21:37.874
What's he saying?

21:38.083 --> 21:39.665
That he doesn't want to go
to summer camp this year,

21:39.875 --> 21:41.874
but I'll be damned if he's
gonna ruin our Italy trip.

21:42.083 --> 21:42.707
Right.

21:42.916 --> 21:45.665
Oh! Aah! Mimsy!
