18:20.638 --> 18:23.343
JARRETT: You better have some good news
for me, boy.

18:23.432 --> 18:26.932
JARRETT: l got McCullen and Bailey
breathing down my spine...

18:27.019 --> 18:29.593
'cause no workers showed up again
this morning.

18:29.688 --> 18:32.642
CROSS: They're hanging in there.
Don't know how, but they are.

18:32.733 --> 18:34.275
JARRETT: Then break them.

18:34.360 --> 18:38.108
JARRETT: You told me nobody got enough
food out of that market to feed a gnat.

18:38.197 --> 18:41.198
l swear to you,
if they got a mouthful, it would be a lot.

18:41.283 --> 18:43.821
-They gotta cave in pretty soon.
-They better.

18:43.911 --> 18:47.114
'Cause that crop ain't gonna last any more
than a couple of days.

18:47.206 --> 18:50.207
These skies open up, and we're awash.

18:50.501 --> 18:52.494
And you told me that wouldn't happen.

18:52.586 --> 18:54.579
CROSS: Don't worry.
JARRETT: l am worried!

18:54.672 --> 18:56.748
JARRETT: That means
you better worry, too.

18:56.841 --> 19:00.007
Okay. l'll get Giddings
and we'll get them out of there tomorrow.

19:00.094 --> 19:02.585
Those bulldogs we had the fight with
at the market...

19:02.680 --> 19:05.550
had checked out of the hotel
when we got there this morning.

19:05.641 --> 19:07.681
CROSS: l'm damn sure
they weren't union reps.

19:07.768 --> 19:10.342
That's all we need,
a couple of Robin Hood types.

19:10.438 --> 19:13.604
Well, they're probably just passing through.
Long gone by now.

19:15.317 --> 19:17.808
What are you doing with them beans?

19:17.903 --> 19:21.438
l spent seven hours on every bean
in that stinking pot.

19:22.658 --> 19:25.576
l don't want them bashed around
like a bucket of bolts.

19:25.661 --> 19:28.745
When it says stir them beans, stir them.

19:29.331 --> 19:31.454
lt's not a bludgeon murder.

19:36.255 --> 19:39.291
Looks like it's about time
for the main course.

19:44.889 --> 19:46.680
HANNlBAL: Down here, you two.

19:51.103 --> 19:53.012
Ladies and gentIemen...

19:53.647 --> 19:57.099
we apologise for interrupting your party
with gunfire.

19:58.235 --> 20:00.311
But it was the only way...

20:00.613 --> 20:03.946
that we could collect
Mr. Jarrett's generous food donation...

20:04.033 --> 20:07.200
without getting blown out of our socks
by his bodyguards.

20:07.286 --> 20:10.904
Now, Miss Allen here will supervise
the loading of the truck...

20:10.998 --> 20:14.284
and l'm sure you four gentlemen
will be happy to assist the lady.

20:14.377 --> 20:15.657
You four, now!

20:15.753 --> 20:19.798
Let's go. You boys wanna move this pig?
Be careful not to drop the apple, please.

20:19.882 --> 20:24.129
l don't know what you think you're doing,
but you're never going to get away with this.

20:24.220 --> 20:28.052
You've shorted your workers' pay
to the degree they can't feed their families.

20:28.140 --> 20:30.097
There's hungry women and chiIdren
out there.

20:30.184 --> 20:31.215
Hungry children?

20:31.310 --> 20:33.931
lf they don't wanna work here,
they can get another job!

20:34.021 --> 20:36.429
No, they can't!
They've already been here 10 weeks.

20:36.524 --> 20:38.730
lt's too late in the season
to go anywhere else.

20:38.818 --> 20:42.767
lt's 50 miles to the nearest bus station,
and they have no means of transportation.

20:42.863 --> 20:44.903
You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
Jarrett.

20:44.990 --> 20:47.446
So, to make things right...

20:47.535 --> 20:50.868
l think you ought to cough up
what you owe them. Right now.

20:50.955 --> 20:54.620
Unless you want us to take you back
and you can explain it to the workers.

20:54.709 --> 20:57.793
-Without your guards.
-Read him the score, Face.

21:06.470 --> 21:09.471
You got 45 workers you shorted $20 a week.

21:09.765 --> 21:13.597
That's $900 for 10 weeks,
or $9,000 you owe us.

21:13.686 --> 21:16.603
FACE: Not counting what you cheated them
for at the market...

21:16.689 --> 21:19.559
which is what put them in this situation
in the first place.

21:19.650 --> 21:23.066
Of course, we would look kindly
on any donations.

21:23.154 --> 21:26.487
That diamond ring you're wearing there,
for instance.

21:31.537 --> 21:32.782
Nice.

21:33.164 --> 21:35.156
About $8,500?

21:35.249 --> 21:37.621
JARRETT: How'd you know that?
FACE: Hobby of mine.

21:37.710 --> 21:41.043
That leaves us $1,000 you owe us...

21:41.130 --> 21:45.507
plus 9.9%% interest of $891 .25.

21:45.885 --> 21:47.509
Ante up, Jarrett.

21:54.643 --> 21:55.675
[Face exclaims]

21:55.770 --> 21:57.596
$1,500. Very good.

21:57.813 --> 22:02.641
Well, that still leaves us $391 .25.

22:03.235 --> 22:06.023
Don't you wanna help out your boss, pal?

22:06.947 --> 22:08.572
There's $400.

22:11.911 --> 22:14.615
$400. Here's your change.

22:15.164 --> 22:17.833
Let's see, that's $8...

22:19.001 --> 22:21.290
and 75 cents.

22:22.463 --> 22:24.788
Your heart's in the right place.

22:26.550 --> 22:27.630
HANNlBAL: l thank you.

22:27.718 --> 22:30.090
The A-Team thanks you.

22:30.388 --> 22:33.721
The newly founded Workers' Cooperative
thanks you.

22:33.808 --> 22:36.096
You're never gonna get away with this!

22:36.185 --> 22:39.305
You'll have a union in this valley
over my dead body!

22:39.397 --> 22:42.563
That's exactly what l was telling
our union members this morning.

22:42.650 --> 22:44.892
We're working on a theme song
and uniforms...

22:45.069 --> 22:46.896
and l'm pushing for matching bow ties.

22:46.987 --> 22:49.941
And not that cIip-on junk.
Those are for geeks.

22:50.032 --> 22:52.108
And geeks are a whole other union.

22:52.201 --> 22:53.232
You're nuts!

22:53.327 --> 22:56.363
No, l'm not, l'm condiments.
l've been promoted.

22:56.455 --> 22:57.784
HANNlBAL: Go, B.A.

23:01.460 --> 23:03.453
[Fast-paced instrumental music]

23:03.546 --> 23:05.254
Giddings, close the gate.

23:14.432 --> 23:16.009
Things are coming together nicely.

23:16.100 --> 23:19.884
You've got a funny idea of how things
come together. Look at the gate.

23:23.399 --> 23:26.316
Watch how l make things come apart.

23:41.167 --> 23:42.365
See?

23:48.966 --> 23:51.753
FACE: This is one of Jarrett's fields.
Pull over, B.A.

23:59.101 --> 24:03.728
Oh, man, there's nothing like the smell
of fresh vegetables in the earth...

24:04.607 --> 24:06.350
to make a man's heart sing.

24:06.442 --> 24:08.435
Especially cabbages, don't you think?

24:08.527 --> 24:10.603
l hate cabbages.
Don't be talking about them.

24:10.696 --> 24:13.104
That is because you don't know anything
about them.

24:13.199 --> 24:15.654
For instance,
here is a little bit of trivia for you:

24:15.743 --> 24:19.278
Did you know that if you take a cabbage
from the field where it grew up...

24:19.371 --> 24:23.452
and sell it to somebody 100 miles away,
often it will escape and find its way home?

24:23.542 --> 24:26.579
That particular strain of cabbage
is called a homing cabbage...

24:26.670 --> 24:28.165
or in Latin, Headius homus.

24:28.255 --> 24:29.880
-Now, shall we say it together?
-No.

24:29.965 --> 24:33.797
What do you mean, ''no''?
l'm telling you, it's a great vegetable.

24:34.470 --> 24:37.969
Nice catch. Next time, try tomatoes.
l hear he loves tomatoes.

24:38.057 --> 24:39.599
l like cabbages.

24:42.144 --> 24:45.845
Excuse me, ma'am. l've got something
l would like you to read after work.

24:45.940 --> 24:48.431
lt might be helpful for you and the little girl.

24:48.526 --> 24:49.605
Thank you.

24:49.693 --> 24:50.773
B.A.: Hi.

24:53.656 --> 24:55.732
[Murdock speaking Russian]

25:06.085 --> 25:07.365
Excuse me, senor.

25:07.461 --> 25:09.952
We'd like for you to read this
when you get off work.

25:10.047 --> 25:14.127
Hiya, fellows. How you doing?
l got something for you to read here.

25:14.510 --> 25:18.590
On your break, of course.
l wouldn't want you to read it until then.

25:18.681 --> 25:20.555
There you go. Then, take a look at it...

25:20.641 --> 25:25.350
talk it over, and if you have any questions,
l'll be around to answer them. There you go.

25:25.938 --> 25:27.598
No, l guess not.

25:28.274 --> 25:31.939
Remember, fellows, there's no legal way
your employer can stop you...

25:32.027 --> 25:34.104
from reading this material on your own time.

25:34.196 --> 25:36.153
All right, that's enough.

25:36.240 --> 25:39.526
You're getting these people's mind
off their work. Move it.

25:39.618 --> 25:43.319
You heard me. l told them not to read it
unless it was on one of their breaks.

25:43.414 --> 25:47.162
-lt's perfectly legal, pal. Ask any lawyer.
-Move, or l drop you.

25:47.626 --> 25:49.085
You don't believe me.

25:49.170 --> 25:52.704
Perhaps you would care
to check with our union representative.

25:52.798 --> 25:56.214
-Union rep? What are you talking about?
-Right there.

25:59.972 --> 26:02.641
He's talking about me hurting you.

26:03.642 --> 26:06.893
l had a feeling he could explain it to you
better than l.

26:06.979 --> 26:08.936
Thanks for your support.

26:09.315 --> 26:13.526
While you're standing around
looking tough, why not take a look?

26:14.320 --> 26:16.775
Or get somebody to read it to you.

26:28.751 --> 26:31.372
What is this garbage?
Who do they think they're kidding?

26:31.462 --> 26:33.419
They're not kidding. They're dead serious.

26:33.506 --> 26:36.376
They've opened up a union hall
here in town and everything.

26:36.467 --> 26:37.630
Then what l heard is true.

26:37.718 --> 26:40.470
They're supposed to be having
a secret meeting someplace.

26:40.554 --> 26:43.923
lf they vote that union in,
they could make it stick.

26:44.100 --> 26:47.682
That means none of the crops here
will get picked for a decent profit...

26:47.770 --> 26:50.178
and that means a lot of money lost, Cross.

26:50.272 --> 26:51.553
That's not gonna happen.

26:51.649 --> 26:54.566
We're gonna find out
where that meeting is, and when.

26:54.652 --> 26:58.436
You just make sure you stop them
before they ever get to vote.

26:58.781 --> 27:00.608
And l don't care how.

27:01.909 --> 27:03.949
Yes, sir. Get right on it.

27:04.912 --> 27:07.699
FACE: That'll give us plenty of room
for the square dance.

27:07.790 --> 27:11.455
Darling, don't worry about the Guernseys.
We'll move them.

27:12.044 --> 27:14.120
Do we have enough paper?

27:15.840 --> 27:18.544
Do we have enough staples?

27:19.844 --> 27:21.302
GARY: ls he okay?

27:21.512 --> 27:26.221
-Actually, l think it's a quiet day.
-Yes, absolutely. Ciao.

27:27.184 --> 27:29.391
That does it. l just got us a meeting place.

27:29.478 --> 27:31.601
lt's a barn over on old Peach Tree Road.

27:31.689 --> 27:35.639
Yeah. l can't believe you got someone
to lend their private property around here.

27:35.735 --> 27:39.602
When you have a good cause,
things are bound to come your way.

27:39.697 --> 27:41.654
-What was her name?
-lnga.

27:42.366 --> 27:45.403
HANNlBAL: Very Continental.
FACE: Yeah, she certainly is.

27:45.828 --> 27:47.452
Gary, are those banners ready?

27:47.538 --> 27:50.159
Not yet, but they'll be ready
by meeting time.

27:50.249 --> 27:53.084
Do we have enough staples?

27:54.545 --> 27:58.922
Please answer, big one,
for we sense great danger.

28:02.636 --> 28:03.881
There you have it, guys.

28:03.971 --> 28:06.379
We can rest easy on the staple front.
We got plenty.

28:06.474 --> 28:10.554
Staples isn't what l'm worried about. Does it
say anything about Cross and Jarrett?

28:10.644 --> 28:14.773
You know they're not gonna sit back and
let us establish this union without a fight.

28:14.857 --> 28:17.146
This thing ain't got nothing to say
about nothing.

28:17.234 --> 28:19.856
lt's this fool moving it all the time.

28:20.946 --> 28:23.651
B.A., you've got to expand your mind...

28:23.741 --> 28:26.944
beyond rational, intelligent,
justifiable explanations.

28:27.036 --> 28:29.953
They ought to open up your head
and give you a new brain.

28:30.039 --> 28:31.616
That will help us all.

28:31.707 --> 28:35.123
Please tell me, great spirit...

got all blown up.

l'm sorry, Hannibal. That's right, you did.

when you tell him. Don't you?

with his next crop, man.

some good news for him.

every piece of muscle in this valley...

-Hold it. Talk to me first.

is that union meeting taking place?

-lt's just the jazz.
-The jazz?

it's sort of nature's way...

31:26.465 --> 31:28.624
of putting your fingers in a light socket.

31:28.759 --> 31:31.084
Our problem is he likes it.

31:31.178 --> 31:33.254
-Say, Face.
-What?

31:33.556 --> 31:34.884
You got a great barn here.

31:34.974 --> 31:38.094
You asked for a meeting hall, Hannibal.
l got you a meeting hall.

31:38.310 --> 31:41.146
Yeah, but we need a little window dressing.

31:42.857 --> 31:44.019
Window dressing.

31:44.108 --> 31:45.388
[Clears throat]

31:48.863 --> 31:52.279
FACE: Can you believe that
''window dressing'' crack Hannibal made?

31:52.366 --> 31:55.818
He doesn't realise what it takes
to procure something from nothing.

31:55.911 --> 31:58.782
-The training and experience.
-Man, who you trying to kid?

31:58.873 --> 32:02.573
You probably conned all the babies
at the maternity ward in the hospital...

32:02.710 --> 32:06.957
-where you was born.
-l know l have a certain flair for persuasion.

32:07.048 --> 32:10.499
But Hannibal, he overlooks the fact
that it takes a real talent.

32:10.593 --> 32:12.550
Like any other fine art.

32:12.636 --> 32:15.044
Let me roll the window down.
Getting smoky in here.

32:15.181 --> 32:17.257
FACE: And there's a lot that goes into it.

32:17.391 --> 32:20.760
lt's a very delicate balance. lt's not easy.

32:21.937 --> 32:26.599
And, if l do say so myself,
l am rather gifted at it.

32:27.276 --> 32:29.482
Man, if Hannibal didn't put you
on the team...

32:29.570 --> 32:32.488
-you'd probably be in jail right now.
-True.

32:36.786 --> 32:39.989
-Pull up there, just ahead of that flatbed.
-Right.

32:50.257 --> 32:51.633
FACE: Hi, there.

32:51.759 --> 32:56.053
-Arturo Wainright. l'm with G.V.F.T.M.B.
-Say what?

32:56.180 --> 32:58.636
Greater Valley
Farm Truck Maintenance Bureau.

32:58.724 --> 33:01.809
Newsweek did a rather flattering article
on us.

33:01.894 --> 33:05.393
FACE: Good reading, if l do say so myself.
FARMER: Greater Valley?

33:05.481 --> 33:07.889
Ain't never heard of that one.

33:07.983 --> 33:11.566
Well, you see,
we're sort of a new consumer organisation.

33:11.862 --> 33:13.938
FACE: Ralph Nader has approved us.

33:14.031 --> 33:17.696
What we do is run random checks
of agro-vehicles.

33:18.285 --> 33:22.200
Make sure they are all operating
up to U.S. Department standards.

33:23.249 --> 33:26.415
Your vehicle's lucky enough
to have been chosen.

33:26.711 --> 33:28.086
[Clears throat]

33:28.170 --> 33:31.005
Congratulations. lt's kind of a privilege.

33:32.508 --> 33:35.711
-By the way, l didn't catch the name.
-Didn't throw it.

33:35.803 --> 33:38.970
Anyway, see, we give you
a few legal papers...

33:39.432 --> 33:44.094
guaranteeing that we'll bring
your truck back exactly like we found it.

33:44.645 --> 33:47.397
And we do some
actual documented farm work.

33:47.481 --> 33:51.099
Real hauling on a pre-arranged test farm...

33:51.193 --> 33:53.435
right here in this very area.

33:55.364 --> 33:58.567
-So you wanna take the truck?
-There you go.

33:59.285 --> 34:02.985
And at absolutely no cost or obligation
to you whatsoever.

34:03.456 --> 34:06.540
Darn good deal,
if you want a little off-the-record opinion.

34:08.960 --> 34:12.295
Now, you check these legal papers here.

34:12.715 --> 34:15.882
They promise you
that we'll bring the truck back.

34:16.385 --> 34:19.552
lf not, you can call
the U.S. Department of Agriculture yourself.

34:19.638 --> 34:22.426
You sure do dress up for a government man.

34:22.891 --> 34:25.596
Those a pair of them hoochie shoes?

34:27.646 --> 34:29.271
That's Gucci.

34:29.940 --> 34:34.400
-No, these are just a regular kind of brown--
-What size you say them slippers was?

34:34.987 --> 34:36.612
[Stuttering] l didn't.

34:37.489 --> 34:39.399
Looks like about a 10.

34:39.742 --> 34:41.201
Same as mine.

34:51.253 --> 34:54.456
HANNlBAL: Great work, Face.
Priceless creativity.

34:56.842 --> 34:58.586
That's a wonderful pair of boots.

34:58.677 --> 35:02.675
The farmer l negotiated with wanted
a little rental fee for the use of his truck.

35:02.765 --> 35:06.300
So, my priceless creativity
is gonna cost you.

35:08.312 --> 35:10.352
What do you think, B.A.?
Can you convert it?

35:10.439 --> 35:12.681
Of course. l just have to change
the feed system.

35:12.775 --> 35:14.435
Go to it, Sergeant.

35:14.819 --> 35:17.310
B.A.: Get down from there, sucker,
we got work to do.

35:17.405 --> 35:18.947

38:03.821 --> 38:08.613
-Are you sure nobody knows we're coming?
-My contact says they don't know a thing.

38:08.701 --> 38:11.239
l don't want anybody
running out of that barn.

38:11.328 --> 38:13.570
Not until they realise
what happens to people...

38:13.664 --> 38:16.831
who come into this valley to try to shove
a union down my throat.

38:16.917 --> 38:18.577
Don't worry, boss.

38:19.128 --> 38:22.960
FACE: Ladies and gentlemen,
l wanna thank you for showing up today.

38:23.049 --> 38:25.753
l wanna thank you,
because when you leave...

38:25.843 --> 38:30.054
there's gonna be a union in this valley
that the growers cannot stop.

38:33.100 --> 38:34.131
That's right.

38:34.226 --> 38:37.560
No longer are they gonna be able
to pay you less than you deserve...

38:37.688 --> 38:40.096
for the kind of work you're doing.

38:40.316 --> 38:41.514
Time now.

38:41.609 --> 38:45.191
And another thing, you're never gonna get
ripped off again!

38:48.991 --> 38:50.782
What do you think? Pretty good turnout.

38:50.868 --> 38:53.441
l got to be honest.
l never thought we'd get this far.

38:53.537 --> 38:56.111
l thought Jarrett would stop us, for sure.

38:58.042 --> 38:59.417
FACE: All right, folks, listen.

38:59.502 --> 39:01.993
We're gonna hand out some ballots
for you to vote on.

39:02.088 --> 39:04.792
Now, all you do is check ''yes''
for ''l want a union''...

39:04.882 --> 39:05.913
or ''no'' for ''l don't.''

39:06.008 --> 39:09.175
FACE: Then we'll gather them, count them,
and see where we stand.

39:09.261 --> 39:10.804
But l wanna urge you to vote ''yes.''

39:10.888 --> 39:13.557
That's the only choice
that makes any sense here.

39:13.641 --> 39:15.016
Murdock, you copy?

HANNlBAL: Murdock, wake up.

39:20.314 --> 39:21.725
Do you copy?

39:22.400 --> 39:25.769
Of course l copy. Four cents a copy.
Do you copy?

39:25.861 --> 39:27.901
Are you watching the road?

39:28.239 --> 39:32.283
Sure. lt's just laying there
like a big old tongue, going....

39:32.576 --> 39:34.201
Can l come down now?

39:34.286 --> 39:37.572
There ain't nobody come or gone
in an hour. l'm lonely up here.

39:37.790 --> 39:40.826
Besides, you Iuck-outs have gotten
aII the punch and cookies.

39:40.960 --> 39:42.787
We'll save you some. Just hang in there.

39:42.878 --> 39:45.500
Jarrett's gonna crash this place
sooner or later.

39:45.965 --> 39:49.334
Okay. 10-4, from a listless guy.

39:51.595 --> 39:53.802
What are you looking at, pal?

39:56.475 --> 40:00.176
As you cast your vote, remember,
this is a message that will tell Jarrett...

40:00.271 --> 40:02.228
you're not
a bunch of scared people anymore.

40:02.314 --> 40:05.268
You're a union, and as a union,
you cannot be pushed around.

40:05.359 --> 40:06.937
Not now, not ever.

40:07.027 --> 40:10.646
He sure is talking up a storm.
ls that the jazz?

40:11.115 --> 40:13.072
More like a tap dance.

the real thing very soon.
