Detective! Hello!

00:05.933 --> 00:07.252
John? How's it going?

00:07.453 --> 00:10.684
- John Irvin, Andy Sipowicz.
JOHN: Good to meet you.

00:10.853 --> 00:12.252
Yeah, how's it going?

00:12.453 --> 00:14.967
I'm temping until your
Miss Abandando returns.

00:15.173 --> 00:20.167
My purse was stolen once
before in law school.

00:20.333 --> 00:22.801
- Oh, yeah?
- And I was attacked.

00:23.013 --> 00:24.890
You don't want to get too settled in.

00:25.053 --> 00:27.487
No. I understand Miss Abandando
is expected back.

00:27.693 --> 00:32.049
You probably don't want to be using
her clerical materials or so forth.

- Thank you.

00:57.693 --> 01:01.732
SIPOWICZ: I had a stronger stream.
- What?

01:01.893 --> 01:05.203
My stream was stronger.
Maybe I don't have to see this guy.

01:05.373 --> 01:06.965
JOHN:
Pardon me.

01:07.453 --> 01:10.251
You've had problems for a week,
right? Go see a doctor.

01:10.413 --> 01:13.928
Hey, at my age, you get a pain for
every bad thought you ever had.

01:14.093 --> 01:15.811
Can't run to the doctor every minute.

01:15.933 --> 01:17.924
Was the last time you saw
a doctor when you got shot?

01:18.093 --> 01:20.323
Haven't had a finger
up my ass since longer than that.

01:20.533 --> 01:23.206
Which is how this guy's
gonna examine my prostrate.

01:23.413 --> 01:25.847
JOHN: Here you go.
- Excuse me, are you writing a book?

01:26.013 --> 01:27.765
- I'm sorry?
- You seem extremely...

01:27.973 --> 01:29.691
...interested in our conversation.

01:29.893 --> 01:31.849
I haven't heard a word
you were saying.

01:32.053 --> 01:35.284
Hey, Andy. You and Bobby
got a shooting, Third and 12th.

01:35.453 --> 01:37.091

02:12.653 --> 02:15.042
I'm Councilman Paul Manos.
There's a woman bleeding!

02:15.213 --> 02:17.044
Our crime scene's a couple
of blocks down.

02:17.253 --> 02:19.483
I called 911.
Cop cars keep passing by!

02:19.653 --> 02:21.086
SIPOWICZ: All right.
MANOS: This woman's been shot!

02:21.253 --> 02:23.164
- Why won't you help?
- I got this. All right!

02:23.333 --> 02:24.891
SIMONE: Be around the corner.
- Yeah.

02:25.053 --> 02:27.248
MANOS: I'm Councilman Paul Manos.
- Yeah, I heard.

02:27.413 --> 02:30.246
A guy came in, shot and ran away.
I got a carry permit...

02:30.413 --> 02:34.292
...but I didn't want to endanger anybody.
- Put that away.

02:38.933 --> 02:42.323
- Help! Can't you see I've been shot?
SIMONE: Ma'am?

02:42.533 --> 02:44.171
- Ma'am!
- Somebody help me!

02:44.373 --> 02:47.888

and wait for the ambulance to come.

SIMONE: I'm not gonna let that happen.

Here's the ambulance.
Everything's fine.

02:54.213 --> 02:55.646
- Am I gonna be fine?
- It's fine.

- What happened?
- I don't know what happened.

Anybody hit?

03:11.973 --> 03:14.806
SIMONE: What do we got?
- Radio cars chased him in the garage.

03:14.973 --> 03:17.965
He opened fire. Picked off
all our guys. We returned fire.

03:18.133 --> 03:19.930
- We had him pinned down.
- Where is he now?

03:20.093 --> 03:22.288

- We don't know. Clear them out!

REPORTER: Is there anybody dead?
MAN: We know of two dead.

04:40.693 --> 04:44.242
That kid over there in the blue jacket
is a rookie, Officer Piccone.

04:44.413 --> 04:49.851
He was in a deli. Hears a gunshot,
looks out, sees this guy staggering.

04:50.053 --> 04:52.613
Piccone runs out,
sees the guy fall, right?

04:52.813 --> 04:56.010
He sees the shooter. He's walking
with his weapon in his hand.

04:56.173 --> 04:59.370
Piccone calls it in, closes in on
this guy walking up Third Avenue.

04:59.573 --> 05:01.643
The shooter turns, sees him,
fires off a round.

05:01.813 --> 05:02.848
Thanks.

05:03.013 --> 05:06.210
Piccone's firing back. It's like
a running gun battle for a block.

05:06.373 --> 05:08.933
- Jeez. Go ahead.
- Sector car responds.

05:09.093 --> 05:12.529
Perp opens fire, hitting both officers.
But they were returning fire too.

05:12.693 --> 05:16.322
Two more civilians go down.
If you ask me, we're lucky it's not more.

05:16.493 --> 05:18.882
- What about the garage?
- The shooter runs in here.

05:19.053 --> 05:22.602
A couple of blue and whites arrive. He
opens fire. Two more of ours go down.

05:22.773 --> 05:24.809
They're returning fire.
They got him pinned.

05:25.013 --> 05:26.890
- A standoff.
- What happened to the guy?

05:27.653 --> 05:29.245
He disappears.

05:30.133 --> 05:32.283
BASS: Look at all these cameras.
- How's the kid?

05:32.693 --> 05:35.366
SIMONE: Piccone's a rookie.
He wasn't even on patrol today.

05:35.653 --> 05:38.725
This kid's doing clerical work.
They got him going for sandwiches.

05:38.933 --> 05:41.288
- Everybody on this, lieutenant.
- Yeah.

05:41.453 --> 05:43.409

- Hey.
- What do we got?

05:58.013 --> 06:02.689
Anna PeÃ±a: Waitress, 35 years old.
Around 11: 15 a white male walks in...

06:02.853 --> 06:06.050
...puts a gun to her chest,
fires one shot, walks out. Not a word.

06:06.213 --> 06:08.488
- Anybody ID the guy?
SIPOWICZ: Nobody knew him.

06:08.653 --> 06:13.283
Coworkers said she's got a husband.
I found her address in her purse.

06:13.493 --> 06:15.961
- I sent a uniform to pick him up.
- Any shell casings?

06:16.333 --> 06:18.608
9 mm. Steel, not brass.

06:18.813 --> 06:20.565
- Which is unusual.
- Gotta be the same guy.

06:20.733 --> 06:22.644
We're picking up steel casings
on the sidewalk.

06:22.813 --> 06:25.373
- Must've started here.
- Third Avenue's a battlefield.

06:25.533 --> 06:27.569
- Four cops down, three civilians.
SIPOWICZ: Perp got away?

06:27.733 --> 06:30.486
- Yeah.
- Owner of the place is Colombian.

06:30.693 --> 06:34.083
- Off the bat, you gotta think drugs.
- Rough way to take care of business.

06:34.253 --> 06:36.289
We got two blocks of chaos out there.

06:36.453 --> 06:40.162
All right, anybody who saw anything,
get them into the house.

06:45.373 --> 06:48.683
This woman's life could
have been saved.

06:49.013 --> 06:51.732

from the time I called 911...

06:51.933 --> 06:56.290
...it took 25 minutes for help. I want
to know why several ambulances...

06:56.493 --> 06:58.802
I told that clown to go
to the station house.

06:58.973 --> 07:00.884
He's a politician.
He can't help himself.

07:01.093 --> 07:03.004
I'm gonna find out about it.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.050
Hey, excuse me.

07:12.013 --> 07:16.768
Mm-mm. He didn't know a damn thing
about handling firearms, I'll tell you that.

07:16.933 --> 07:18.127
Put two cops in the hospital.

07:18.213 --> 07:20.249
He must've knew
something about what he was doing.

07:20.413 --> 07:23.689
No, if you're shooting to hit a target,
you gotta have a two-handed grip.

07:23.893 --> 07:25.167
- None of this.
- Guys.

07:25.333 --> 07:29.690
Don't talk to each other about what you
saw. Wait till you sit with a detective.

07:29.853 --> 07:32.048
- Excuse me!
- Yeah?

07:32.253 --> 07:34.448
I'm Councilman Paul Manos.

07:34.613 --> 07:37.332

Here you go.

07:49.573 --> 07:51.484
- Thanks a lot.
SIMONE: Yeah.

07:52.253 --> 07:54.562
You gave them my weapon
for ballistics, huh?

07:54.733 --> 07:58.726
Yeah, every cop who discharged a round,
just so we can figure out who did what.

07:58.933 --> 08:03.688
- I should've put that guy down.
- It's not so easy when you're under fire.

08:03.853 --> 08:05.366
I don't even think I hit him once.

08:05.573 --> 08:10.169
Officer Piccone, right now we gotta
concentrate on finding this guy, all right?

08:10.333 --> 08:13.086
Most people out there on Third Avenue,
once they hear gunshots...

08:13.253 --> 08:15.084
...they're ducking inside
or on the ground.

08:15.253 --> 08:18.723
If you can do any better here
on your description, man...

08:22.053 --> 08:24.806
- White male.
- How old do you figure?

08:27.373 --> 08:31.048
See, I never got a clean look at his face.
I was coming up behind him.

08:31.213 --> 08:32.566
Mm-hm.

08:32.773 --> 08:37.847
- Well, what color hair then?
- Kind of blondish, like I said.

08:38.533 --> 08:42.003
His height, his build.
You said average.

08:42.212 --> 08:47.128
Detective, the guy's walking
with the gun raised up...

08:47.293 --> 08:49.124
...then he starts firing.
- I understand.

08:49.293 --> 08:51.887
The only clear thing
in my mind is that gun.

08:57.613 --> 08:59.365

Thank you.

09:00.853 --> 09:02.206
Excuse me.

GRIFFIN: Hey, Arthur.
- Hey, Dick. How you doing? Come in.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.965
You got a madhouse
on your hands, huh?

09:09.133 --> 09:11.283
Yeah, something like that.
So, what's up?

09:11.453 --> 09:14.525
I know you probably want
the kid to fend for himself...

09:14.693 --> 09:17.765
...but just so you know, your brother got
himself jammed with his sergeant.

09:18.373 --> 09:19.692
Jammed how?

09:19.853 --> 09:22.731
They had a blow-up yesterday in
the squad. I don't know the particulars...

09:22.893 --> 09:24.884
...but MacNamara may be
looking to hurt him.

09:25.053 --> 09:28.329
- Reggie might have it coming.
- But you don't know the particulars.

09:28.533 --> 09:31.093
I don't wanna see MacNamara
jammed up either with this thing.

09:31.253 --> 09:32.652
You guys know each other, right?

09:32.813 --> 09:35.611
- We went through the academy together.
- That's a good thing.

09:35.773 --> 09:38.287
- Maybe you two can talk it through.
- Yeah, maybe.

09:38.573 --> 09:41.212
I hate to distract you
with all you got going here...

09:41.373 --> 09:44.445
...but if this thing escalates, it might
ripple through the whole precinct.

09:44.653 --> 09:47.333
- Wouldn't be good for anybody.
- Okay, Dick. I'll look into it.

09:47.333 --> 09:47.970
- Wouldn't be good for anybody.
- Okay, Dick. I'll look into it.

09:48.133 --> 09:52.046
- Thanks for stopping down, okay?
- I had to go to the borough anyway.

09:52.213 --> 09:53.885
I'll see you.

09:58.533 --> 10:02.162
- You didn't see the gunman at all?
- No.

10:02.333 --> 10:03.766
Sit down.

10:04.413 --> 10:08.406
And you have no idea why somebody
would want to harm Miss PeÃ±a?

10:08.773 --> 10:11.924
- Not at all. She's a lovely person.
- How long did she work for you?

10:12.093 --> 10:15.722
Four months. Honestly, I didn't need her.
I hired her because of her husband.

10:15.893 --> 10:17.212
- I'm a fan of his.
- Husband?

10:17.853 --> 10:24.326
- That would be Javier PeÃ±a?
- He plays trumpet, jazz. He's very good.

10:24.533 --> 10:26.967
While he makes himself known,
I give his wife work.

10:27.133 --> 10:31.092
- Three days a week.
- Tell me...

10:31.253 --> 10:36.373
...you thought of the possibility that this
thing was directed at you, Mr. Bellisario?

10:36.533 --> 10:38.285
I'm sorry, what?

10:38.453 --> 10:42.571
Maybe somebody was trying to get
at you, make trouble in your life.

10:42.973 --> 10:46.283
By murdering a waitress? How do
you come to a thought like that?

10:46.493 --> 10:51.521
Bellisario, the restaurant business,
you know, maybe you got enemies.

10:53.093 --> 10:57.689
- I see.
- How long you been in business?

10:58.013 --> 11:03.292
A strange man, white man,
walks into my place, shoots Anna PeÃ±a.

11:03.493 --> 11:06.246
Goes out, shoots more people,
shoots police.

11:06.413 --> 11:08.802
How is this about how
long have I been in business?

11:09.013 --> 11:10.969
If I want to delve into
your business...

11:11.133 --> 11:14.762
...if I want to talk to everybody
you ever served beans, I will do that.

11:14.933 --> 11:18.005
Because all that which went
down today, started at Bellisario's.

11:18.173 --> 11:20.562
- And you are point A.
- And I'm Colombian...

11:20.733 --> 11:23.691
...so I must be in the drug business.
That's where we're going, right?

11:23.853 --> 11:26.925
Being honest,
I can't remember the last time...

11:27.093 --> 11:31.803
...I dealt with Colombians on a police
matter that drugs weren't involved.

11:32.733 --> 11:33.893
Have a nice day.

11:33.893 --> 11:34.882
Have a nice day.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.483
What time's your
doctor's appointment?

11:54.653 --> 11:57.929
I got all these interviews.
I can't get over there.

11:58.893 --> 12:00.611
I called Narcotics
on that restaurant owner.

12:00.773 --> 12:02.092
Anything there?

12:02.253 --> 12:05.609
His brother took one collar
for possession.

12:06.653 --> 12:09.770
I gotta talk
to that loudmouth councilman.

12:12.333 --> 12:16.292
- I gotta go to the doctor.
- Mm-hm.

12:17.493 --> 12:20.326
You know, you're losing
an hour a shift in the john.

12:22.933 --> 12:24.924
- Here you go.
WOMAN: Thanks.

12:27.133 --> 12:28.486
All right.

12:28.653 --> 12:30.371
If this is the speed you operate at...

12:30.533 --> 12:32.569
...I understand why that
waitress bled to death.

12:32.773 --> 12:36.732
Sorry to hold you up, councilman.
We're taking people in turn.

12:37.253 --> 12:39.926
That is what I heard
you said before, isn't it?

12:40.133 --> 12:42.601
You hope no one got
preferential treatment.

12:42.773 --> 12:44.968
I want your DD5's to reflect...

12:45.133 --> 12:47.772
...I phoned in that 911.
- I'll make sure that gets in.

12:49.133 --> 12:53.684
With the shooter still at large,
we're focusing on physical description.

12:53.853 --> 12:56.606
Anything you might have seen him do
or heard this guy say.

12:56.773 --> 12:59.367
White, average height,
about 5' 10".

12:59.573 --> 13:02.531
- That's what everyone's saying.
- Did you get a look at his face?

13:03.213 --> 13:05.681
- I didn't really. No.
- Searching your recollection...

13:06.253 --> 13:09.802
...could he have muttered anything?
Done anything peculiar?

13:09.973 --> 13:13.522
All I can give you is, he was
wearing faded blue jeans...

13:13.693 --> 13:18.164
...unraveling at the cuffs,
with dirty, white Converse sneakers.

13:18.573 --> 13:21.212
You got a pretty good look
from the ankles down.

13:21.373 --> 13:23.762
Surprising what details
stick in the mind.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.685
Mm-hm.

13:26.133 --> 13:28.442
I gotta get back to my office.

13:28.613 --> 13:31.571
Could you have been under
the table, councilman?

13:32.693 --> 13:35.491
Is that why you happened
to notice the shooter's feet?

13:36.213 --> 13:38.044
What kind of smart-ass
question is that?

13:38.253 --> 13:42.326
We are just trying to situate
everyone in the restaurant, sir.

13:44.333 --> 13:47.484
On the DD5's,
I'll note that you were on the floor.

14:02.933 --> 14:05.845
- Lieutenant?
- Hey, Reggie.

14:08.693 --> 14:10.172
How you been, man?

14:11.493 --> 14:13.449
I've been getting along.
How about you?

14:13.613 --> 14:15.012
FANCY:
I'm good.

14:16.373 --> 14:19.365
You need to come over
and see your new nephew.

14:21.333 --> 14:23.688
Yeah, I've been meaning to do that.

14:24.493 --> 14:30.045
- So anything we need to talk about?
- Hey, you summoned me, remember?

14:30.213 --> 14:34.092
All right then, I hear you're
in a jam with your sergeant.

14:34.253 --> 14:35.971
Nothing I can't handle.
What, you got...

14:36.133 --> 14:38.442
...somebody looking over my shoulder?
- What happened?

14:38.653 --> 14:41.121
- It don't concern you.
- It does. I'm your brother.

14:43.133 --> 14:46.284
Well, he told me to change a tire.

14:46.453 --> 14:49.729
Four white cops standing around
and my black ass.

14:49.893 --> 14:52.327
And MacNamara talks
to me like some field hand.

14:52.493 --> 14:54.927
So you called him a
"red-faced donkey son of a bitch"?

14:55.693 --> 14:57.923
- He was looking to piss me off.
- And you went for it.

14:58.293 --> 15:01.126
Look, MacNamara's got a problem
with black police, bottom line.

15:01.293 --> 15:03.602
I don't care what you did
to get where you're at...

15:03.773 --> 15:06.845
...I got too much integrity to have
these fools talk any kind of way.

15:07.053 --> 15:09.362
Me and MacNamara go back a ways.
If you're lucky...

15:09.533 --> 15:11.524
...he might do me a good turn.
- Please, man.

15:11.693 --> 15:14.844
- I don't need your bowing and shuffling.
- Quit being a knucklehead.

15:15.053 --> 15:18.489
I do my job. If you're saying I gotta
get talked to like I'm picking cotton...

15:18.693 --> 15:22.572
...for the privilege of keeping on with it,
no, man. Hell, no! I ain't with that!

15:22.733 --> 15:24.883
You're willing to leave the
force over this?

15:25.053 --> 15:26.964
I am not kissing any ass to stay on it.

15:27.133 --> 15:30.170
- So you want me to stay out of it?
- I don't know. Is that in your nature?

15:31.653 --> 15:36.443
Just stay clear of MacNamara until I've
had a chance to sit down with him.

15:42.333 --> 15:46.167
- Am I dismissed?
- Yeah, Reggie, you're dismissed.

15:56.693 --> 15:58.763
SIPOWICZ: Now?
DOCTOR: Now.

16:00.733 --> 16:04.169
- Nasty scars.
- I had an accident at work.

16:04.333 --> 16:07.166
- Bear down.
- Whoa, boy!

16:07.333 --> 16:10.131
Try not to pull away,
it just takes me longer.

16:10.293 --> 16:13.763
- Are you pitching a tent up there?
- Just another second.

16:13.933 --> 16:18.006
- All right. You can stand up.
- What makes you think so?

16:18.173 --> 16:21.413
Because of your age, I'll run a PSA test.
I felt no nodules or hard spots.

16:21.413 --> 16:22.892
Because of your age, I'll run a PSA test.
I felt no nodules or hard spots.

16:23.053 --> 16:26.682
And I have no suspicion of a tumor.
What you've got is a prostatitis.

16:26.893 --> 16:29.646
- What am I gonna do about that?
- Give another urine sample.

16:29.853 --> 16:34.643
Then you're gonna take ciprofloxin
for a month. Then you're gonna be fine.

16:34.813 --> 16:39.568
- I've been abstaining on sex.
- No reason to.

16:39.733 --> 16:42.372
If anything, sex in moderation
relieves your condition.

16:43.293 --> 16:46.330
When you finish this medicine, I wanna
see you for a follow-up appointment.

16:46.493 --> 16:50.406
Yeah, I'll circle that on my
calendar with a big happy-face.

16:55.333 --> 16:58.086
Okay. You got a good
look at the shooter?

16:58.253 --> 17:00.642
I was right there when
he shot that Spanish guy.

17:00.853 --> 17:05.404
The Spanish man said something,
I couldn't hear what. And then, bam.

17:05.573 --> 17:10.442
From the look on his face, it meant
nothing to him. He just went on his way.

17:10.613 --> 17:14.810
- Can you describe him?
- Yeah. He's 5' 10", if that.

17:14.973 --> 17:19.171
Medium build, call it 170 pounds.
His hair was sandy brown.

17:19.772 --> 17:26.212
Not well kempt, fairly long.
He has a pale, angular face.

17:26.373 --> 17:31.572
Kind of haunted look to it.
I'd put him early to mid 30s.

17:31.733 --> 17:36.602
- Let's see. Thin lips, small nose.
- Are you sure about all this?

17:36.773 --> 17:40.971
He passed right in front of me. Besides,
I make a habit of studying people.

17:41.133 --> 17:43.601
Something I like to do.
Hundreds of people a day.

17:43.813 --> 17:47.442
- I won't soon be forgetting this one.
- This is very good.

17:47.613 --> 17:50.286
- I've been a help?
- Yeah.

17:50.453 --> 17:53.525
- I want to put you with a police artist.
- Fine, fine.

17:53.733 --> 17:56.645
Then you can help me?
I help you, you help me?

17:56.853 --> 18:02.325
- Yeah, sure. You want a few dollars?
- I want you to help me warn people.

18:03.533 --> 18:07.526
- Concerning what?
- I must warn mankind...

18:07.693 --> 18:12.164
...as to the identity of the wicked
son of perdition, the beast.

18:12.373 --> 18:14.489
- I know who he is.
- Oh, boy.

18:14.653 --> 18:18.009
Hey, open your mind to this, all right?
Open your mind to my knowledge.

18:18.173 --> 18:22.132
I have all knowledge going
back 236 trillion years.

18:22.333 --> 18:26.372
Let me show you what I'm talking
about here. I want to show you.

18:26.533 --> 18:30.606
Listen. Listen. I don't want to know
about the trillion years.

18:30.773 --> 18:33.082
I don't want to know about
the son of perdition.

18:33.253 --> 18:37.849
- I want to know if you saw the guy.
- Yeah, I saw him.

18:38.013 --> 18:41.528
Can I use that description?
People's lives may be at stake.

18:42.213 --> 18:46.889
You can use it. He looked
just like what I said.

18:47.973 --> 18:50.168
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:55.013 --> 18:57.129
The shooter entered
Bellisario's at 8:45.

18:57.293 --> 18:59.887
He fired one round into Anna PeÃ±a,
killing her.

19:00.053 --> 19:03.329
Then walked out of the restaurant
and moved north, up Third Avenue.

19:03.493 --> 19:04.892
300 feet from the restaurant...

19:05.053 --> 19:07.851
...he shot a pedestrian
named David Casteneta in the chest.

19:08.013 --> 19:09.969
Casteneta was DOA at the hospital.

19:10.133 --> 19:13.205
The shot that killed Casteneta
was heard by Officer Piccone...

19:13.373 --> 19:15.329
...who called it in
and began pursuit on foot.

19:15.493 --> 19:18.610
Was Piccone able take the guy out
before the guy shoots again?

19:18.773 --> 19:22.004
He was concerned about discharging
his weapon on a busy sidewalk.

19:22.173 --> 19:24.482
AIELLO: Was he under the impression
the perp shared his concern?

19:24.653 --> 19:27.292
FANCY: The shooter fires
on Piccone at this point.

19:27.493 --> 19:30.132
- Officer Piccone returns fire.
- Missing the shooter.

19:30.613 --> 19:33.571
Patrolman Evans and Byrne arrive
in a radio car at this point...

19:33.733 --> 19:35.371
...and join in the exchange of fire.

19:35.533 --> 19:39.082
Both patrolmen in the car are struck
and wounded, and a British tourist...

19:39.253 --> 19:42.325
...an Amelia Rose, who's stable,
but didn't get a look at the perp.

19:43.133 --> 19:47.923
Also, a 60-year-old female in a
grocery store was struck in the head.

19:48.133 --> 19:51.842
She was DOA. According to ballistics,
the stray was a police round.

19:52.013 --> 19:54.846
- We don't know yet which officer.
- Probably that rookie.

19:55.013 --> 19:57.527
We got no idea who the perp is,
what his problem was?

19:57.693 --> 19:59.411
- Racial? What? Anything?
FANCY: Not yet.

description from a vagrant.

20:05.973 --> 20:09.568
It squares with our partials. But it's
much more detailed and complete.

20:10.373 --> 20:11.726
We've made a sketch.

20:11.933 --> 20:13.651

- This going to TV?

20:13.813 --> 20:16.805
Everywhere, including psychiatric
facilities on the chance he's under care.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.203
As you know,
there can be confidentiality problems.

20:20.413 --> 20:23.769
Oh, yeah. Confidentiality's more
important than a few dead citizens.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.009
Where do we stand on this stink
about EMS response time?

20:26.213 --> 20:30.331
That was Councilman Manos. I think
he's gonna be leaving that issue alone.

20:30.533 --> 20:35.243
The media's already got it. Did we bypass
a dying waitress to get to wounded cops?

20:35.413 --> 20:39.486
We're looking into the 911 call.
Also how he escaped from the garage.

20:39.693 --> 20:41.445
Looks like he made it out
over the roof.

20:41.653 --> 20:43.325
Which is worse,
letting him get away...

20:43.493 --> 20:45.768
...or not nailing him
before he got in the garage?

20:45.973 --> 20:48.771
I want you to cut two detectives loose.
Send them back down.

20:48.973 --> 20:51.965

be getting this guy identified.

with his sergeant.

I can be back inside two hours.

All right. I'll run it from here.

to contact Javier PeÃ±a?

at his place. We'll try again later.

Something might've happened.

22:14.653 --> 22:16.484

He had an audition this morning. He never
showed up. An audition to play music.

22:20.533 --> 22:23.730
It was important to him. He wouldn't
have missed it without calling.

22:23.933 --> 22:26.049
All right. We'll go there ourselves.
Thanks.

go back to my place.

25:56.493 --> 25:57.812
Come here.

26:02.413 --> 26:04.210
I asked Reggie
to do something for me...

26:04.373 --> 26:06.568
...he gives me mouth
in the middle of the station house.

26:06.733 --> 26:09.088
- He knows he reacted wrong.
- I got a platoon to run.

26:09.253 --> 26:11.972
- I take that disrespect off of no one.
- I wouldn't expect you to.

26:12.173 --> 26:15.370
You know what I mean. They put you
in a position of authority yourself.

26:15.533 --> 26:20.561
You do me a good turn here, I'd be
very grateful. I'll keep on top of him.

26:20.733 --> 26:23.884
Plus, he's running around saying
it's some kind of a racial thing.

26:24.053 --> 26:26.931
- You and me always got along, right?
- Right.

26:27.133 --> 26:28.964
In this station,
I get along with anybody.

26:29.133 --> 26:32.170
- Blacks, women...
- Mac, I'm asking you for a favor.

26:32.373 --> 26:34.489
Reggie's got a problem
with white bosses.

26:34.653 --> 26:37.531
- It's him who's in the wrong line of work.
- I don't think he is, Mac.

26:37.693 --> 26:40.048
I'd like to keep him on the job.

26:40.773 --> 26:45.051
Look, as far as I'm concerned,
he keeps his mouth under control...

26:45.213 --> 26:46.693
...we don't have a problem.
- Good.

26:46.693 --> 26:46.966
...we don't have a problem.
- Good.

26:47.133 --> 26:49.169
This thing, I'm willing to let it slide.

26:49.373 --> 26:51.284
- Okay. I won't forget.
- But I tell you...

26:51.973 --> 26:53.372
...he pops off at me again...

26:53.533 --> 26:56.366
...never mind the paperwork.
It's gonna be me and him...

26:56.533 --> 26:58.603
...and the badges get set aside.
- Okay.

26:58.813 --> 27:02.886
If I need Reggie to fix a tire,
he's gonna get on his knees and do that.

27:03.053 --> 27:05.931
But you won't go out of turn
and ask him to fix a tire, right?

27:06.093 --> 27:08.482
If it's somebody else's turn,
you don't call on Reggie.

27:09.413 --> 27:13.531
- No. Why would I do that?
- Just so that's clear.

27:14.733 --> 27:16.166
Sure.

27:16.333 --> 27:18.324
Hey, nice seeing you, Fancy.

27:18.533 --> 27:21.605
Yeah, you take care of yourself, Mac.

27:29.053 --> 27:31.772
SIMONE: Take a look at this man.
- Oh, yeah. That's definitely him.

27:32.253 --> 27:34.847
- Steven Capers.
- I suppose I should recognize him.

27:35.373 --> 27:38.888
- Living next to him for five years.
- Yeah, up until a few months ago.

27:39.053 --> 27:42.409
- I liked him, but he was a troubled man.
- How could you tell that?

27:42.573 --> 27:45.724
He muttered to himself,
more and more as time went on.

27:45.893 --> 27:50.045
He talked to me more than anybody else,
but it was just neighbor chatter.

27:50.213 --> 27:52.966
You know, when we'd run
into each other. "Hi, Mrs. Eubanks."

27:53.133 --> 27:55.966
I'd say, "Hi, Steven. How are you?"
And then we'd talk a bit.

27:56.173 --> 27:59.563
- You never had problems with him?
- No, but since he's been evicted...

27:59.973 --> 28:05.093
...I've been seeing him outside
with a strange look, even when I'd pass.

28:05.253 --> 28:08.404
- I mentioned it to Mr. Bernstein.
- This is the landlord.

28:08.573 --> 28:10.848
- We're trying to get with him.
- He's out of town.

28:11.013 --> 28:15.086
Did Steven ever have any words with
the people that took over his old place?

28:15.253 --> 28:17.323
I don't think so.
Well, not that I'm aware of.

28:17.533 --> 28:20.366
I do know that he was on disability
of some sort...

28:20.533 --> 28:23.127
...and he lost his benefits recently.

28:23.293 --> 28:26.046
- He was upset.
- So you did see him this morning?

28:26.253 --> 28:28.972
Yeah, standing across the street,
but that wasn't unusual.

28:29.133 --> 28:33.365
About 9:00, I heard this loud noise
next door. You know, like a gunshot.

28:33.533 --> 28:37.128
So I peeked out the door and I saw
Steven. And he's holding a pistol.

28:37.293 --> 28:41.366
He backed me into my apartment. I was
so flabbergasted I couldn't say a word.

28:41.533 --> 28:45.048
He says, "Get in the closet,
Mrs. Eubanks. " He could've killed me.

28:45.413 --> 28:48.371
- He must've liked you.
- Pays to be neighborly, I guess.

28:52.253 --> 28:53.652
Hey.

28:56.813 --> 29:00.044
Sarge said we got another body
and an ID on the perp.

29:00.213 --> 29:03.603
BASS: New DOA is the husband
of the waitress that got shot.

29:03.773 --> 29:06.890
Simone and Sipowicz found him
when they went to make notification.

29:07.173 --> 29:10.449
The perp barricaded the woman
in the next apartment in her closet.

29:10.613 --> 29:13.446
Simone and Sipowicz heard her.
They got her in Interview One.

29:13.613 --> 29:16.252
- What'd she say about the perp.
- He used to live in...

29:16.453 --> 29:19.604
...the apartment where they found
the new DOA. They're getting details.

29:19.773 --> 29:22.924
- So all hell broke loose while I was gone.
- We all got family.

29:24.133 --> 29:26.442
I heard we got a witness
and an ID, is that right?

29:26.613 --> 29:28.888
Yeah. Lt. Fancy
was just bringing me up to speed.

29:29.053 --> 29:30.850
- Good.
- Yeah.

29:32.613 --> 29:35.923
PICCONE: I'm here to see Martinez.
JOHN: He's right over there.

29:37.653 --> 29:40.451
- You got a minute for me, detective?
- Sure. How's it going?

29:40.613 --> 29:42.171
PICCONE:
I wrote up a statement.

29:42.333 --> 29:45.325
When I talked to Simone,
I couldn't get my thoughts together.

29:45.493 --> 29:47.961
That was verbal, right?
Your interview with Detective Simone?

29:48.133 --> 29:49.122
Yeah.

29:49.293 --> 29:51.204
You gave him what you knew
in terms of looking for the guy?

29:51.373 --> 29:52.931
- Right.
- I don't think you want...

29:53.093 --> 29:55.846
...to make a written statement
until you talk to your delegate.

29:56.013 --> 29:58.288
- All right.
- The way you discharged your weapon.

29:58.453 --> 30:01.206
- Well, it looks like I didn't hit anybody.
- Uh-huh.

30:01.373 --> 30:04.206
I hope I didn't hit anybody,
because I know I didn't hit the perp.

30:05.253 --> 30:06.652
They're testing all the guns.

30:06.853 --> 30:11.165
I'd hate to think that I hit a civilian.
It's bad enough to miss the guy.

30:11.333 --> 30:16.248
You did your best out there. Anyway,
I'd trash your written statement for now.

30:16.413 --> 30:18.165
- All right?
- Yeah.

30:18.893 --> 30:23.205
- Okay. Thanks for the advice, detective.
- Anytime.

30:31.893 --> 30:32.882
[DOOR OPENS]

30:34.213 --> 30:37.250
COSTAS: Hi, Andy.
- Hi.

30:38.533 --> 30:42.128
I've got Thai food in the fridge.
Lemongrass soup.

30:42.293 --> 30:44.249
That sounds great.

30:44.853 --> 30:48.004
I heard you guys found another victim
connected with the street shooter.

30:48.173 --> 30:51.245
SIPOWICZ: Yeah. We like a guy
in the homicides. Some headcase...

30:51.453 --> 30:54.729
...from the apartment building
where two of the victims live.

30:55.373 --> 30:56.852
What's that?

30:58.773 --> 31:00.411
I, uh...

31:00.933 --> 31:04.050
- I went to the doctor today.
- What for?

31:04.213 --> 31:06.522
Turns out I got
an inflamed prostrate.

31:06.693 --> 31:10.003
He gave me this medicine,
said it's nothing to worry about.

31:10.373 --> 31:12.011
- Good.
- Yeah.

31:12.173 --> 31:17.122
Actually, he gave me the okay
in the area of relations...

31:17.293 --> 31:21.491
...which I've been concerned about.
- You had?

31:21.653 --> 31:24.042
Like you haven't noticed?

31:24.213 --> 31:28.889
No, I noticed that we
weren't having relations.

31:29.053 --> 31:32.966
- I didn't think it was medical reasons.
- No?

31:34.773 --> 31:38.322
What did you think? Because
of finding out about that incident...

31:38.493 --> 31:41.644
...where the guy attacked you?
- Yeah.

31:41.813 --> 31:44.805
No, it was this other thing.

31:45.293 --> 31:49.650
- Well, I wish you'd told me.
- What am I gonna tell you about?

31:49.813 --> 31:54.091
I'm peeing in two different directions?
I'm falling apart in all my systems?

31:57.653 --> 31:59.644
Andy, we're gonna grow old together...

31:59.813 --> 32:03.567
...and what's gonna happen
to our bodies will happen.

32:04.373 --> 32:06.523
But let's always talk...

32:06.693 --> 32:09.571
...so we don't misunderstand
each other.

32:09.733 --> 32:12.884
Okay. It's a deal.

32:14.293 --> 32:19.845
And this with my prostrate,
he says it's completely correctable.

32:20.013 --> 32:21.526
Good.

32:21.693 --> 32:28.041
He says this medicine's good.
He also said relations were good.

32:29.813 --> 32:34.443
Well, have some soup
and we'll try a treatment.

32:50.773 --> 32:53.810
- Good morning, detective.
- How's it going?

32:53.973 --> 32:56.885
- Could I talk to you for just a minute?
- Yeah.

32:57.053 --> 33:00.443
I just want to assure you,
in regard to your concerns yesterday...

33:00.653 --> 33:03.804
...I would never eavesdrop
on a conversation.

33:03.973 --> 33:06.726
I was having a medical problem,
maybe I overreacted.

33:06.893 --> 33:10.886
We work in such proximity here.
Trust is very important.

33:11.053 --> 33:14.329
I was having prostrate difficulties,
but I think I'm on a mend.

33:14.653 --> 33:16.245
I'm glad.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.523
Have I been mispronouncing
that word all these years?

33:18.733 --> 33:22.169
- I always thought it was "prostate."
- No, it's "prostrate."

33:22.493 --> 33:25.724
I'm Harry Bernstein. I'm looking
for Detective Simone or Sipowicz.

33:25.893 --> 33:29.169
I'm Sipowicz. You the landlord
of that building on Second Avenue?

33:29.333 --> 33:30.732
- Yeah.
- Come on in.

33:30.893 --> 33:35.045
I got your messages off my machine.
This dead guy, wow!

33:36.053 --> 33:39.090
That should give you some indication
how my luck was going.

33:39.253 --> 33:42.165
- So you were out of town, huh?
- Yeah, I was in Atlantic City.

33:42.333 --> 33:44.642
This is Harry Bernstein.
He owns that building.

33:44.813 --> 33:48.601
- How's it going, Mr. Bernstein?
- Some horror story at my place.

33:48.773 --> 33:51.003
I understand you're looking
for Steven Capers.

33:51.173 --> 33:53.164
- Yeah, that's right.
- When he came to my place...

33:53.373 --> 33:56.126
...he was a graduate student at NYU.
- No kidding.

33:56.293 --> 33:58.761
All that deep thinking,
he must've blown a gasket...

33:58.933 --> 34:00.730
...because by the time
I had to evict him...

34:00.893 --> 34:04.010
...he was a total nutbar.
- We're looking to find this guy.

34:04.653 --> 34:07.770
He started in your building,
now he's shooting people on the street.

34:08.612 --> 34:11.605
- I wouldn't know where to look.
- What's up with the notebooks?

34:12.253 --> 34:16.405
He had hundreds of these in the place.
He'd written on every page too.

34:16.572 --> 34:18.404
I got them in a storage
room over there.

34:19.773 --> 34:23.208
Out of curiosity. You know,
eavesdropping on an unsound mind.

34:23.373 --> 34:25.170
- He ever ask for these back?
- No.

34:25.333 --> 34:27.688
You haven't had any contact
with this guy recently?

34:27.853 --> 34:31.766
Not since I kicked him out.
Mrs. Eubanks said she'd seen him.

34:31.933 --> 34:34.969
I guess he had strong feelings
about that apartment...

34:35.132 --> 34:38.603
...to go back and kill those people.
- I guess.

34:38.773 --> 34:41.844
- Anything?
SIMONE: Nothing I can make out so far.

34:42.013 --> 34:44.925
Look, Mr. Bernstein,
I want to talk to our boss about these...

34:45.092 --> 34:48.005
...then we'll take a ride to your building.
I'll wanna see all of these.

34:48.172 --> 34:52.530
Yeah, sure. Let me ask you,
the city's gonna pay...

34:52.693 --> 34:54.763
...to replace the door
you guys busted, right?

34:54.933 --> 34:57.447
You gotta make a claim
with the Corporation Council.

34:57.613 --> 35:00.207
- How old do you plan to live to be?
- Perfect.

35:02.413 --> 35:03.687
SIMONE: Lieu.
FANCY: Yeah?

35:03.853 --> 35:05.969
- We're talking to the landlord.
- He give you anything?

35:06.173 --> 35:09.483
The perp kept lots of notebooks. This
guy saved them. We'll go pick them up.

35:09.693 --> 35:12.571
Okay. I gotta talk to this kid.

35:12.733 --> 35:14.564
Ballistics came back with his gun.

35:14.773 --> 35:16.684
- The stray that killed the woman?
- Yeah.

35:16.853 --> 35:20.892
That's rough. All right, I'll let
you know about the notebooks.

35:21.053 --> 35:23.726
- How you doing, Officer Piccone?
- Okay.

35:25.013 --> 35:28.050
- You wanted to see me, lieutenant?
- Yeah, come on in.

35:32.333 --> 35:34.005
How you doing?

35:34.733 --> 35:40.091
Pretty bad night. To tell you
the truth, my mind wouldn't sleep.

35:40.653 --> 35:43.247
You understand why I didn't
shoot at first, don't you?

35:43.413 --> 35:46.086
Officer Piccone,
listen to what I'm gonna tell you.

35:46.253 --> 35:48.130
- This is off the record.
- Off the record?

35:48.293 --> 35:52.047
I'm not sure when you'll receive official
notification, but I wanted you to know.

35:52.213 --> 35:54.733
The civilian who died, the bullet
they took from her in autopsy...

35:54.733 --> 35:55.961
The civilian who died, the bullet
they took from her in autopsy...

35:56.173 --> 35:58.323
...matches up to your weapon.

35:58.893 --> 36:01.612
- Oh, man.
- I'm sure there's no criminal problem...

36:01.773 --> 36:03.764
...but there will be an investigation.

36:03.933 --> 36:05.969
- My weapon?
- PBA representation...

36:06.173 --> 36:11.372
Who? Who was killed? You said "her."
A woman? The woman in that store?

36:11.573 --> 36:13.165
That's right.

36:13.773 --> 36:17.925
You should plan on this getting
to the press sooner rather than later.

36:18.493 --> 36:21.371
I've seen cops who did exactly
the right thing and still got hung up.

36:21.533 --> 36:23.524
- Let alone what I did.
- Just the magnitude...

36:23.693 --> 36:27.402
...of what happened yesterday,
you need to be ready for media scrutiny.

36:27.573 --> 36:29.768
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

36:33.013 --> 36:37.689
Son, your life changed forever
when that guy fired that first shot.

36:37.893 --> 36:39.804
You gotta deal with those changes.

36:40.013 --> 36:45.246
And you have to decide if you ever
want to be in that position again.

36:46.253 --> 36:49.768
- You think I should quit?
- That's not for me to say.

36:49.933 --> 36:53.323
But maybe you should ask yourself, are
you doing what you should be doing?

36:53.533 --> 36:57.242
I've wanted to be a cop
all my life! All right, so...

36:57.413 --> 36:59.643
...I didn't do the right
thing this one time.

36:59.813 --> 37:03.408
This job, it can do a lot
to you emotionally...

37:03.573 --> 37:08.010
...and it's just a job.
There's other jobs.

37:09.013 --> 37:11.447
You really believe that, lieutenant?

37:12.253 --> 37:15.086
The notification will come
through your sergeant.

37:17.773 --> 37:19.331
Okay.

37:24.573 --> 37:26.803
Let me ask you, these notebooks...

37:26.973 --> 37:29.441
...I can get them back at some point?
- Want them back?

37:29.613 --> 37:32.081
- Of course I want them.
- Wait, I gotta use the can.

37:32.253 --> 37:34.926
- Now I can't stop going.
- You're making up for lost time.

37:35.093 --> 37:36.811
The guy's a notorious killer.

37:36.973 --> 37:40.568
Maybe this stuff turns out to be
worth something. I got a solid claim.

37:40.733 --> 37:43.531
He's in arrears to me
for four months' rent.

37:44.813 --> 37:46.371
Andy!

38:01.853 --> 38:04.048
BERNSTEIN:
That's this maniac.

38:35.533 --> 38:36.932
Thanks.

38:38.653 --> 38:42.646
- How's it going, Reggie?
- Did a 4 to 12 yesterday.

38:42.813 --> 38:47.011
- MacNamara treated me okay.
- Good.

38:50.893 --> 38:53.407
Did he make you lick
the shine off his shoes?

38:53.573 --> 38:56.246
- He made me lick a little.
- I didn't ask you to see him.

38:56.453 --> 39:00.446
No, you weren't stand up enough for
that. You told me to follow my nature.

39:00.613 --> 39:04.652
No one asked you, but I know
you reached out to that guy.

39:04.813 --> 39:07.566
- I came to say thanks.
- That's big of you, Reggie.

39:07.773 --> 39:09.491
Now, here's some free advice.

39:09.693 --> 39:12.924
Get enough self-respect so when
some fool talks to you like a nigger...

39:13.093 --> 39:15.732
...you don't go nuts and jam yourself
to prove he isn't right.

39:15.893 --> 39:17.963
You got funny ideas
about self-respect.

39:18.173 --> 39:20.846
My idea is, when I hear an ass
out in the field braying...

39:21.013 --> 39:24.449
...I don't feel any deep need
to start braying back.

39:24.613 --> 39:28.811
From where you sit, Reggie, I could
never do anything right for you.

39:28.973 --> 39:31.771
I don't expect that to change now.

39:31.973 --> 39:35.648
If you and MacNamara train wreck,
maybe you should transfer out of there.

39:36.253 --> 39:40.007
Maybe I should. I'll see how it goes.

39:42.773 --> 39:45.128
When can I come check junior out?

39:46.013 --> 39:50.564
Anytime. Lillian and the girls
want to see you too.

39:51.053 --> 39:55.365
- How about this weekend? Saturday?
- Good.

39:56.053 --> 39:59.363
- Maybe Sunday.
- Either way.

40:19.733 --> 40:21.485
FANCY: You okay, Bobby?
- Yeah.

40:22.053 --> 40:24.772
Bass already signed off on
your weapons discharge report.

40:24.973 --> 40:28.124
- Did he make it a good shooting?
- Yeah, he made it a good shooting.

40:29.653 --> 40:33.805
I heard you found a witness that
saw this guy run from the garage.

40:34.253 --> 40:36.562
He split over the roof.

40:38.173 --> 40:43.042
Got a tape of that
councilman's 911 call.

40:43.253 --> 40:46.768
MANOS: <i>He's been shot! Oh, God,</i>
<i>send an ambulance right now!</i>

40:46.933 --> 40:49.208
<i>- A man 's been shot!</i>
WOMAN: <i>A man 's been shot?</i>

40:49.373 --> 40:53.161
MANOS: <i>Yes, Just now! It's happening</i>
<i>right now! Right in front of me. Oh, God!</i>

40:53.333 --> 40:56.166
WOMAN: <i>Where are you, sir?</i>
MANOS: <i>I'm Councilman Paul Manos.</i>

40:56.333 --> 40:58.244
WOMAN:
<i>No, where are you, sir?</i>

40:58.413 --> 41:01.803
MANOS: <i>Bellisario 's. Corner of Third</i>
<i>Avenue and 10th. Send the police!</i>

41:01.973 --> 41:05.932
WOMAN: <i>Third Avenue and 10th Street?</i>
MANOS: <i>He walked out with the gun!</i>

41:06.093 --> 41:08.812
<i>- Send help right now!</i>
WOMAN: <i>I'm sending help, sir.</i>

41:08.973 --> 41:12.329
<i>You said Bellisario 's at the corner</i>
<i>of Third Avenue and 10th Street?</i>

41:12.493 --> 41:15.053
MANOS: <i>Yes! Yes!</i>
WOMAN: <i>Who is it that's been shot?</i>

41:15.253 --> 41:18.609
MANOS: <i>I don 't know. A man.</i>
WOMAN: <i>Is it Just one person?</i>

41:18.773 --> 41:21.048
MANOS:
<i>I think so.</i>

41:21.613 --> 41:22.693
- "A man's been shot"?
- From underneath the table.

41:22.693 --> 41:24.126
- "A man's been shot"?
- From underneath the table.

41:24.333 --> 41:26.972
He didn't see who the hell got shot.
The paramedics arrive...

41:27.173 --> 41:29.403
...they see a pedestrian bleeding
further down the block...

41:29.573 --> 41:31.609
...they think that's the job.

41:35.973 --> 41:38.123
So that's what happened there.

41:38.493 --> 41:41.405
Do you want to get any trauma
treatment on your shooting?

41:41.853 --> 41:43.411
No, I'm all right.

41:46.733 --> 41:49.088
Just gotta type this mess up.

42:02.013 --> 42:03.844
Did you put this on my desk?

42:04.013 --> 42:07.005
Yes, detective. I was looking up
something else and I noticed...

42:07.213 --> 42:09.568
...that word we had talked about.
- Live and learn.

42:09.733 --> 42:12.566
- Thought you might find it interesting.
- Oh, absolutely.

42:12.773 --> 42:16.686
This way, if I'm ever on <i>Jeopardy</i>
and they ask about prostrate...

42:16.893 --> 42:20.772
...some other idiot's gonna say "the
gland behind the nuts. " And I'll say:

42:20.973 --> 42:24.773
"No, no, no, that means 'to lie face
down in a posture of submission.'

42:24.773 --> 42:25.683
"No, no, no, that means 'to lie face
down in a posture of submission.'

42:25.853 --> 42:28.526
My old friend PAA Irvin
told me that.

42:28.733 --> 42:31.930
That other civilian aide we had,
all she did was gave us our messages.

42:32.133 --> 42:35.364
But this guy,
he gives us definitions and everything.

42:35.533 --> 42:38.093
I'm sorry. Was I inappropriate?

42:39.773 --> 42:45.769
No. I'm just a little chatty.
I almost got murdered earlier.

42:49.333 --> 42:51.369
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:51.573 --> 42:53.484
So...

42:53.653 --> 42:57.089
...I was thinking, maybe I could
wash your car for a year...

42:57.253 --> 43:00.006
...or something like that.
- Yeah, that'd be good.

43:02.173 --> 43:07.566
The other guy, all the jams we were in,
that never came up.

43:07.773 --> 43:10.241
Yeah, but I'm sure
he was always looking out for you.

43:10.413 --> 43:13.291
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

43:13.453 --> 43:16.525
- Bass sign off on the shooting?
- Yeah.

43:17.253 --> 43:23.601
Because I'm prepared to nominate it
among my all-time favorites.

43:27.613 --> 43:29.888
I'm gonna get some lunch.
You want something?

43:30.093 --> 43:31.765
No, I'm good.

43:34.133 --> 43:36.966
- Thanks.
- Anytime, partner.
