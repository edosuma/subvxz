Previously onB Positive...[computer chimes]

00:04.047 --> 00:07.877
Hey, Mr. Nomad,
how's your trip going?

00:07.920 --> 00:09.835
Great. Just great.

00:09.879 --> 00:12.142
The freedom of the open road
is truly exhilarating.

00:12.186 --> 00:14.840
Just do me a favor.
Text me your location

00:14.884 --> 00:18.496
every few hours, you know,
to help with the search.

00:18.540 --> 00:21.412
So, tomorrow I have to be
at the hospital...

00:21.456 --> 00:22.935
9:00 a.m. I know.

00:22.979 --> 00:24.328
It's in my calendar.

00:24.372 --> 00:26.983
You're the reason
I'm doing this.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.941
And you remember that
when you're able to run

00:28.985 --> 00:31.161
and play with
the other children.

00:31.205 --> 00:33.990
I saw a hip replacement surgery
on YouTube.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.601
They pretty much
hang you from the ceiling.

00:36.645 --> 00:39.474
If you're trying to make me
jealous, it's working.

00:39.517 --> 00:43.130
[barking]

00:43.173 --> 00:46.307
Meredith.
Oh, my God.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.572
Is everything okay?

00:50.615 --> 00:52.443
Call 911.

00:52.487 --> 00:55.359
How's Harry?GINA: I haven't talked
to him yet.

00:55.403 --> 00:56.665
You're not at the hospital?

00:56.708 --> 00:58.580
I'm in jail.

01:02.323 --> 01:04.803
Hey. Any word on Meredith?

01:04.847 --> 01:06.370
She's still in the ICU.

01:06.414 --> 01:08.198
Let's just get there.
We'll get my car later.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.765
What were you busted for?

01:09.808 --> 01:11.854
Remember a few years ago

01:11.897 --> 01:14.204
when I got arrested for
selling fake IDs?
Yeah.

01:14.248 --> 01:15.727
Why is it even illegal?

01:15.771 --> 01:18.861
All you were trying to do
is help kids drink.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.953
We come here too damn much.

01:23.996 --> 01:27.435
My third husband
died in this hospital.

01:27.478 --> 01:29.045
No, my second.
My third died on a boat.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.700
Well, in the ocean.

01:31.743 --> 01:34.877
He almost made it back
to the boat.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.444
I don't want to die
in a hospital.

01:36.487 --> 01:38.359
I want to be out in the woods.

01:38.402 --> 01:41.753
Perhaps a sylvan glade,
like Walden Pond.

01:41.797 --> 01:44.016
That just means your corpse
will get eaten

01:44.060 --> 01:47.411
by the coyotes
and rats and whatnot.That's fine.

01:47.455 --> 01:50.153
I'll still be part
of the cycle of life.

01:50.197 --> 01:51.502
They'll start with your eyes.

01:51.546 --> 01:54.157
Would you please shut up?!

01:55.332 --> 01:57.769
Any news?Not yet.

01:57.813 --> 02:00.468
I can't believe
you're walking already.

02:00.511 --> 02:03.645
They made me, sadistic
sons of bitches.

02:03.688 --> 02:05.125
Thank you.

02:06.561 --> 02:07.910
Is your doctor American?

02:07.953 --> 02:09.607
What does that have to do
with anything?

02:09.651 --> 02:11.522
So... no.

02:13.524 --> 02:14.786
Hey, how's Meredith?

02:14.830 --> 02:15.961
We don't know.
Harry's with her.

02:16.005 --> 02:17.920
Oh. Norma,

02:17.963 --> 02:19.356
I am so sorry I wasn't here.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.315
Can we please
not do this now?

02:21.358 --> 02:22.751
Do you forgive me?

02:22.794 --> 02:24.622
What's important is that
you forgive yourself.

02:24.666 --> 02:27.147
I don't.
Then I'm happy.

02:31.716 --> 02:32.804
How is she?

02:32.848 --> 02:34.893
She's gone.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.123
[knock on door]

02:47.167 --> 02:48.472
Hey.

02:48.516 --> 02:51.649
Hey. Oh,
I'm so glad you're here.

02:51.693 --> 02:53.825
I came as quick as I could.Oh...

02:53.869 --> 02:55.000
How's Harry?

02:55.044 --> 02:56.654
He hasn't come out
of his room,

02:56.698 --> 02:58.047
and he won't talk to anybody.

02:58.090 --> 03:00.310
Mm. I'll check on him.Thank you.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.007
Here, sit.

03:02.051 --> 03:04.271
Sorry you had to
cut your trip short.

03:04.314 --> 03:06.273
Oh, it's okay.

03:06.316 --> 03:07.709
Things weren't going
that great.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.406
Oh. Why not?

03:09.450 --> 03:11.582
Well, I met a woman.

03:11.626 --> 03:14.150
We got drunk and, uh,

03:14.194 --> 03:16.674
you know...

03:16.718 --> 03:18.415
No, I don't know.

03:18.459 --> 03:22.376
Come on, you know...

03:22.419 --> 03:25.727
I don't know. Tell me.

03:25.770 --> 03:28.512
We had intimate relations.

03:28.556 --> 03:31.211
Which I was led to believe
were mutually satisfying.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.169
However, upon my awakening,

03:33.213 --> 03:34.823
I discovered she had robbed me.

03:34.866 --> 03:37.695
[laughing]

03:37.739 --> 03:40.263
Oh, oh...

03:42.091 --> 03:44.398
She took my cash,
credit cards, laptop,

03:44.441 --> 03:45.877
even my EpiPen.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.488
Luckily she didn't find
my backup. Heh.

03:47.531 --> 03:49.707
You poor thing.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.187
I thought we had
a real connection.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.754
Then she took everything.

03:52.797 --> 03:55.235
It was like a two-hour
version of my marriage.

03:57.846 --> 03:58.847
So what about you?

03:58.890 --> 04:00.892
You spent the night in jail.

04:00.936 --> 04:02.720
Oh, it's not a big deal.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.722
Me and a shoplifter
from TJ Maxx,

04:04.766 --> 04:07.377
we talked about winter looks
for under $30.

04:07.421 --> 04:10.815
Still, behind bars with
a common thief. Frightening.

04:10.859 --> 04:13.253
You had sex with a common thief.

04:13.296 --> 04:16.691
Yes. Yes, I did.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.093
Ugh.

05:11.136 --> 05:14.270
I know you're in there.
I heard you grunt.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.620
Hi.

05:16.664 --> 05:19.144
Yeah.

05:19.188 --> 05:21.321
I'm so sorry about Meredith.

05:21.364 --> 05:25.063
She was a wonderful woman.Yeah. Thank you.

05:27.892 --> 05:31.374
So, uh, how you doing?

05:31.418 --> 05:32.984
You want to talk?

05:33.028 --> 05:34.377
Well, we're talking now.

05:34.421 --> 05:37.337
Can you not hear me?

05:37.380 --> 05:39.034
Harry...

05:39.077 --> 05:40.992
There's nothing to talk about.

05:41.036 --> 05:42.037
I knew she was gonna die,

05:42.080 --> 05:45.040
she died, I'm sad.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.347
End of story.

05:50.698 --> 05:53.483
So what's going on here?

05:53.527 --> 05:54.615
I'm giving away her clothes.

05:54.658 --> 05:58.009
See anything you like?

05:58.053 --> 05:59.924
You don't have
to do that today.

05:59.968 --> 06:01.709
You might want to take
some time.

06:01.752 --> 06:04.015
[scoffs] For what?

06:04.059 --> 06:07.671
It's just stuff.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.891
Doesn't mean anything.

06:09.934 --> 06:12.284
I'm just saying you might not
be ready to part with...

06:12.328 --> 06:16.027
Drew, I appreciate
you stopping by.

06:16.071 --> 06:17.725
But I'm good.

06:17.768 --> 06:21.337
Okay. Well, I'm here
if you need me.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.034
Thank you.

06:31.565 --> 06:34.785
You know, that thank you
kind of implied goodbye.

06:38.659 --> 06:39.877
Oh, let me give
you a hand.

06:39.921 --> 06:42.402
Ah, thank you.
Gabby,

06:42.445 --> 06:43.794
do me a favor.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.622
Go to my room
and get my painkillers.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.581
Okay.I've counted them.

06:47.624 --> 06:48.799
[sadly]:
Okay.

06:50.322 --> 06:52.499
So, how you feeling?

06:52.542 --> 06:54.675
Tired, but for the first time
in months

06:54.718 --> 06:56.067
my hip didn't
wake me up last night.

06:56.111 --> 06:59.723
Hip-hip hooray!

06:59.767 --> 07:01.290
Did you see what
I did there?

07:02.204 --> 07:03.640
I hope you don't have a scar.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.903
Aw, who cares?
No one's gonna see it.

07:05.947 --> 07:09.516
Ah, sure. For you
that's probably true.

07:10.604 --> 07:12.649
[knock on door]It's open.

07:12.693 --> 07:15.391
Hey.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.567
Ugh.

07:17.611 --> 07:20.918
I was wondering
how it went with Harry.

07:20.962 --> 07:21.963
He'll be okay.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.573
He just needs some time.

07:23.617 --> 07:26.620
Uh, I hope so.
What's that smell?

07:26.663 --> 07:28.578
Oh, I microwaved
some salmon last night.

07:28.622 --> 07:29.927
Do you want a chunk?

07:29.971 --> 07:32.887
I think I'm eating it now.

07:32.930 --> 07:34.976
Is that dill I'm tasting?

07:35.019 --> 07:36.281
Good for you.

07:36.325 --> 07:39.023
I just wanted to say again

07:39.067 --> 07:40.851
how happy I am
that you're back.

07:40.895 --> 07:42.723
Yeah. Me, too.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.986
Yeah.

07:45.029 --> 07:47.292
Hmm.

07:47.336 --> 07:49.120
So this van girl...

07:49.164 --> 07:50.905
Hannah.Hannah.

07:50.948 --> 07:54.212
Yeah. What's the deal
with Hannah?

07:54.256 --> 07:55.692
Well, I told you.

07:55.736 --> 07:56.911
You know,
we spent the night together,

07:56.954 --> 07:58.434
and then she ripped me off.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.045
Wow, that's crazy.
[forced laugh]

08:01.089 --> 08:02.525
Is she cute?

08:02.569 --> 08:04.875
I think so, yeah.

08:04.919 --> 08:07.182
In a "doesn't shave her arms
or legs or really anywhere"

08:07.225 --> 08:08.923
kind of way.

08:08.966 --> 08:10.011
Huh.

08:10.054 --> 08:12.448
Why do you care?

08:12.492 --> 08:15.495
Well, why wouldn't I?

08:15.538 --> 08:18.541
You know, you're my friend
and... [awkward chuckle]

08:18.585 --> 08:20.021
You're my friend!

08:20.064 --> 08:22.284
[awkward laugh]

08:22.327 --> 08:24.416
Mm.

08:24.460 --> 08:25.896
Interesting.

08:25.940 --> 08:28.203
What's interesting?
Nothing's interesting.

08:28.246 --> 08:32.250
You know what, it's cold
and it stinks in here,

08:32.294 --> 08:33.687
so I'm going.

08:33.730 --> 08:36.516
Bye.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.518
Interesting.It's not interesting!

08:38.561 --> 08:40.520
Oh, it's interesting.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.741
Can I tell you something?Sure.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.787
I'm more comfortable
with all the touching

08:46.830 --> 08:48.832
because you're gay,
but it'd be a lot sexier

08:48.876 --> 08:50.486
if you were straight.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.575
You sound like my
high school girlfriend.

08:52.619 --> 08:53.968
[chuckles]

08:54.011 --> 08:55.273
We gotta get that hip moving
before you start

08:55.317 --> 08:56.361
your physical therapy.

08:56.405 --> 08:57.667
Now, hang on.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.495
[clears throat]

08:59.539 --> 09:01.889
Ooh, careful with those.
They're pretty strong.

09:01.932 --> 09:04.413
Oh, I can handle it.

09:04.456 --> 09:07.459
I took the brown acid
at Woodstock.

09:08.722 --> 09:11.072
[knock on door]

09:11.115 --> 09:13.030
Who is it?

09:13.074 --> 09:14.075
Spencer.

09:14.118 --> 09:15.729
Ugh. All right.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.951
What do you want?

09:22.736 --> 09:24.259
Okay, come in.

09:27.436 --> 09:30.613
The cashier tried to sell me
some fruity seltzer.

09:30.657 --> 09:34.399
I reminded her
that I pee standing up.

09:34.443 --> 09:36.010
[grunts]

09:36.053 --> 09:39.100
All right. Thanks.
Thanks, thanks.
Ah.

09:39.143 --> 09:42.320
And I won't waste your time
asking how you're doing.

09:42.364 --> 09:44.235
Thanks again.

09:48.239 --> 09:52.592
You know, when my Jackie
passed, everybody was all,

09:52.635 --> 09:55.464
"How are ya? How you doing?"

09:55.507 --> 09:57.640
And I'm like, "How the hell
do you think I am?

09:57.684 --> 10:01.818
I'm sad, and I don't know how
to work the dishwasher."

10:03.515 --> 10:06.301
You know what I hate?
"I'm here for you."

10:06.344 --> 10:07.650
Ay...

10:07.694 --> 10:10.044
Well, will you go
somewhere else for me?

10:10.087 --> 10:11.436
The weirdest thing,

10:11.480 --> 10:13.700
I started having
terrible heartburn.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.789
Really?Yeah.

10:15.832 --> 10:20.620
So I went to my doctor--
American, by the way--

10:20.663 --> 10:25.886
and he says, "Have you had
any changes in your lifestyle?"

10:25.929 --> 10:28.497
So I tell him my wife died,

10:28.540 --> 10:31.152
and it was like a pipe burst.

10:31.195 --> 10:33.720
All of a sudden I'm spilling
my guts about Jackie

10:33.763 --> 10:35.504
like I'm at a slumber party.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.288
Don't tell me you cried.

10:37.332 --> 10:40.422
Like I was watching
Brian's Songall over again.

10:40.465 --> 10:45.819
But, I gotta tell you,
right after that,

10:45.862 --> 10:47.516
the heartburn was gone.

10:47.559 --> 10:49.561
So what are you saying?

10:49.605 --> 10:51.912
You're gonna do what
you want to,

10:51.955 --> 10:55.698
but talking helped me.

10:55.742 --> 10:58.048
Mm. So you want me to talk?

10:58.092 --> 10:59.702
You want me to open up.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.617
Yeah.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.054
All right, how's this?

11:04.098 --> 11:08.015
I can never look at you again
without picturing you crying.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.453
That's fair.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.681
I was told that
this was your idea.
Yeah.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.857
I was thinking maybe we could
start a tradition.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.511
Every time a resident passes,
we could gather together

11:26.555 --> 11:28.165
and celebrate their life.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.385
Every time?Is that a problem?

11:30.428 --> 11:32.256
It is during flu season.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.738
Here, try this.

11:35.782 --> 11:38.828
I made it specially for
our older residents.
Mmm!

11:38.872 --> 11:40.395
Delish. What's in it?

11:40.438 --> 11:42.789
Kahlua and Ensure.

11:45.617 --> 11:48.272
You gotta be kidding me.What?

11:48.316 --> 11:50.361
Does my attire not
meet your approval?

11:50.405 --> 11:52.668
Uh, no. I mean...

11:52.712 --> 11:54.409
[stammering]

11:54.452 --> 11:56.977
You gotta be kidding me
that a woman could look so hot

11:57.020 --> 11:59.501
and yet appropriate.

11:59.544 --> 12:02.634
Thank you.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.985
Good save.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.901
Bert, what is this?

12:07.944 --> 12:10.077
Baby back ribs, baby.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.905
I thought you were
making finger foods.

12:11.948 --> 12:13.645
Ribs are finger food.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.909
Show me how you eat 'em
without using your fingers.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.433
No, I was thinking
little sandwiches and canapes,

12:18.476 --> 12:19.782
hors d'oeuvres.

12:19.826 --> 12:20.957
Take a bite.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.742
Bert, I don't want to.Take a bite.

12:27.703 --> 12:29.749
Oh, my God.Right?

12:29.792 --> 12:33.883
I forgot there was
a dead woman for a second.

12:33.927 --> 12:37.321
Pork. It's the meat that
heals a broken heart.

12:38.888 --> 12:40.672
Mmm.

12:43.240 --> 12:47.027
Thank you for coming
to celebrate Meredith.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.290
I bet you she's
in heaven right now

12:49.333 --> 12:51.596
with some serious FOMO.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.859
Serious what?

12:52.902 --> 12:56.036
FOMO.
Fear Of Missing Out.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.647
Would it kill you to say that?

12:58.690 --> 13:00.170
Sorry.

13:01.128 --> 13:04.218
Harry, would you like
to say a few words about

13:04.261 --> 13:06.873
your wonderful wife
of 55 years?

13:06.916 --> 13:09.136
I'm good.

13:09.179 --> 13:12.922
Oh, um...

13:12.966 --> 13:16.752
Okay, would anyone like
to share some memories?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.885
I've got something.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.803
When I first moved here,
which was years ago,

13:23.846 --> 13:25.456
I was going through
a rough time.

13:25.500 --> 13:29.112
Meredith,
whom I'd never spoken to,

13:29.156 --> 13:32.246
one day invites me
to a casino.

13:32.289 --> 13:35.162
We played penny slots
for hours,

13:35.205 --> 13:37.251
and then hit
the all-you-can-eat buffet.

13:37.294 --> 13:41.385
Then she pulls out
this big tote bag.

13:42.734 --> 13:45.128
What we lost gambling,
we took home

13:45.172 --> 13:47.391
twice as much
in king crab legs.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.611
[laughter]

13:49.654 --> 13:52.657
She was my first friend
here, Harry.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.007
To Meredith.

13:54.050 --> 13:55.530
To Meredith.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.054
I-I'd like to say something.

14:01.579 --> 14:02.885
Some time ago,

14:02.929 --> 14:05.453
Meredith and I started
a book club.

14:05.496 --> 14:08.456
We never got a chance to talk
about our last book,

14:08.499 --> 14:10.806
Catcher in the Rye,

14:10.850 --> 14:13.026
but she left me her thoughts.

14:17.987 --> 14:21.817
"Holden Caulfield was a schmuck.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.560
"All he does
is call people phonies.

14:25.603 --> 14:29.042
"I wish he'd taken the time
to get to know them.

14:29.085 --> 14:32.262
"He would have seen
everyone has something

14:32.306 --> 14:34.308
"that makes them special.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.398
"And connecting with people

14:37.441 --> 14:40.531
is what gives life its meaning."

14:41.750 --> 14:45.623
Meredith enriched
my life's meaning.

14:45.667 --> 14:49.976
Her passing means the end
of our book club,

14:50.019 --> 14:54.458
but I'll always be grateful
for our time together.

14:54.502 --> 14:56.634
I got her hooked
on the classics,

14:56.678 --> 14:59.899
she got me hooked on
The Bachelorette.

14:59.942 --> 15:04.381
And this year...
she's black!

15:04.425 --> 15:07.080
To Meredith!To Meredith.
To Meredith.

15:09.169 --> 15:11.345
Gina, thank you for
putting this together.

15:11.388 --> 15:12.912
It was very nice.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.957
You're welcome.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.220
Are you sure you don't want
to say a few words?

15:17.264 --> 15:18.961
Oh, very.

15:19.005 --> 15:23.400
Okay, um, then I will.

15:23.444 --> 15:25.794
[groans]

15:25.837 --> 15:27.796
[groans]

15:27.839 --> 15:29.493
Watch it.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.280
Everybody! Hello!

15:33.323 --> 15:34.411
Um, will you turn off
the music?

15:34.455 --> 15:36.109
Thank you.

15:36.152 --> 15:39.851
I would like to take this moment
to talk about

15:39.895 --> 15:41.984
what Meredith meant to me.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.508
Who wants buffalo wings?

15:44.552 --> 15:45.770
Bert, not now.

15:45.814 --> 15:47.120
Sorry.

15:47.163 --> 15:48.948
Even before I bought
Valley Hills...

15:48.991 --> 15:50.210
I'll just put 'em here.

15:50.253 --> 15:52.647
Thanks!

15:52.690 --> 15:53.735
There's spicy and mild.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.215
Okay.

15:55.258 --> 15:57.217
They're all mixed together,
so be careful.

15:57.260 --> 15:58.566
Bert!

15:58.609 --> 16:01.438
She said she wanted
finger foods.

16:01.482 --> 16:04.311
Even before I bought
Valley Hills,

16:04.354 --> 16:06.182
Meredith was...

16:06.226 --> 16:09.881
one of my favorite people here.

16:09.925 --> 16:13.407
And after I took over,
we got even closer.

16:15.800 --> 16:20.370
I guess I've... I've grown
closer to all of you.

16:20.414 --> 16:21.981
And so...

16:26.159 --> 16:27.856
And so now that she's...

16:30.685 --> 16:33.209
I'm so sorry.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.867
Oh, boy, I got a hot one.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.180
Hey, buddy.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.619
Meredith's not here anymore.

16:54.317 --> 16:56.058
[entry panel beeps]

17:03.109 --> 17:06.112
Don't believe me, huh?

17:10.986 --> 17:12.683
Yeah.

17:16.122 --> 17:18.515
It still smells like her, huh?

17:21.910 --> 17:24.521
I miss her like hell already.

17:26.175 --> 17:29.526
But honestly...

17:29.570 --> 17:31.876
part of me is relieved.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.229
I dreaded losing her
for so long,

17:36.272 --> 17:37.926
but now that she's,
you know...

17:37.969 --> 17:41.103
I feel like this, this...
this weight has been lifted.

17:41.147 --> 17:44.063
And I... I hate myself
for thinking like that.

17:47.979 --> 17:50.591
The worst part is that

17:50.634 --> 17:54.595
she would know exactly
what to say

17:54.638 --> 17:56.292
to make me feel better.

18:03.256 --> 18:05.040
[sniffles]

18:06.389 --> 18:07.390
[door opens]

18:07.434 --> 18:08.522
DREW:
There you are.

18:10.350 --> 18:13.004
You okay?No.

18:13.048 --> 18:16.834
I'm sorry.

18:16.878 --> 18:21.056
It's not just Meredith, it's...

18:21.100 --> 18:22.971
it's everyone in this place.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.800
What do you mean?

18:25.843 --> 18:27.889
When I looked around

18:27.932 --> 18:31.501
and I saw all their faces,

18:31.545 --> 18:35.288
um... I realized
they're all gonna die,

18:35.331 --> 18:36.680
and I'm gonna have
to give that speech

18:36.724 --> 18:38.291
over and over again.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.206
You've worked here for years.

18:40.249 --> 18:41.468
Other people have died.

18:41.511 --> 18:46.386
Yeah. It was always sad, but...

18:46.429 --> 18:48.997
it feels different now.

18:49.998 --> 18:52.174
When I was driving the van,
I was just trying

18:52.218 --> 18:53.741
to get through the day
so I could go back

18:53.784 --> 18:54.872
to my real life.

18:54.916 --> 18:57.136
And now these people are
my life.

18:57.179 --> 19:00.443
And when they die,
it feels like

19:00.487 --> 19:02.706
I'm losing a family member.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.187
Except you actually
like these people.

19:05.231 --> 19:08.147
I'm just gonna keep
getting close to them,

19:08.190 --> 19:11.193
and I'm gonna keep
losing them.

19:11.237 --> 19:14.370
And when they go,
a whole new batch

19:14.414 --> 19:17.286
will come in, and then
they'll become family,

19:17.330 --> 19:20.681
and then they'll die,
and I-I can't handle that.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.771
You're thinking about this
all wrong.

19:23.814 --> 19:27.340
It's not about losing people,

19:27.383 --> 19:29.037
it's about connecting with them.

19:30.778 --> 19:33.694
Drew, that's what
makes this so hard.

19:33.737 --> 19:34.695
Well, yeah.

19:34.738 --> 19:36.871
It's never gonna be easy.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.873
But you are making
a huge difference

19:38.916 --> 19:41.484
in their lives when they
need someone the most.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.051
Just like you did with me.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.880
So what do I do now?

19:47.011 --> 19:51.015
You go back in there
with the people you love,

19:51.059 --> 19:54.410
and you enjoy every moment

19:54.454 --> 19:56.107
you are lucky enough
to have with them.

19:59.328 --> 20:02.070
I'm glad you got robbed
and came back.

20:03.724 --> 20:04.725
Interesting.

20:04.768 --> 20:06.074
It's not interesting.

20:06.117 --> 20:07.031
Oh, I'm telling you,
it's interesting.

20:15.866 --> 20:18.565
[yawning]

20:18.608 --> 20:20.915
[birds singing]

20:20.958 --> 20:22.090
Harry?

20:22.133 --> 20:23.744
Morning.

20:23.787 --> 20:25.267
What are you doing?

20:25.311 --> 20:27.617
Going on the road with you.

20:27.661 --> 20:31.099
Get out of my bed.

20:31.142 --> 20:33.144
What?
