CLYDE: <i>13 Bannerman Road</i>
<i>is where Sarah</i>
<i>Jane Smith lives</i>

00:07.307 --> 00:09.409
<i>and it's home to things</i>
<i>way beyond your imagination.</i>

00:12.812 --> 00:15.849
<i>There's an extraterrestrial</i>
<i>supercomputer in the wall,</i>

00:15.915 --> 00:19.786
<i>her son, a genetically</i>
<i>engineered boy genius,</i>

00:19.853 --> 00:22.422
<i>a schoolgirl investigator</i>
<i>across the road</i>

00:22.489 --> 00:25.925
<i>and a whole</i>
<i>universe of adventure</i>
<i>right here on the doorstep.</i>

00:29.462 --> 00:30.430
(SCREAMS)

00:46.112 --> 00:47.647
-Ready?
-Always.

00:49.949 --> 00:51.584
My name is Miss Myers

00:51.651 --> 00:54.087
and you're going to
help me find my child.

00:54.154 --> 00:56.189
Whoever left her
on my doorstep,
that was no accident.

00:56.256 --> 00:58.391
I think someone needs me
to protect this baby.

00:58.458 --> 00:59.793
Before they come
looking for her.

00:59.859 --> 01:01.127
<i>This was a bloke.</i>

01:01.194 --> 01:04.364
<i>Fell out of the sky.</i>
<i>His skin was all metal.</i>

01:04.431 --> 01:05.765
Bannerman Road.

01:05.832 --> 01:07.000
MYERS: Get in,
if you want the child to live!

01:07.066 --> 01:09.769
She is no child.
She is a weapon.

01:09.836 --> 01:11.871
Sky's energy,
it's flooding out of her.

01:11.938 --> 01:14.674
MYERS:
The doom of the Metalkind
has come!

01:32.792 --> 01:34.828
What just happened?

01:34.894 --> 01:37.730
I think Sky just grew up.

01:37.797 --> 01:39.933
What, with no birthdays?
That's just rubbish!

01:40.133 --> 01:41.668
I am too late.

01:41.734 --> 01:44.471
Face your destruction,
Metalkind.

01:44.537 --> 01:46.372
The child is your doom!

01:46.439 --> 01:48.541
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

01:48.608 --> 01:49.876
What's happening to me?

01:52.612 --> 01:54.380
MYERS: Destroy him.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.015
(GRUNTING)

01:59.018 --> 02:01.888
-Again, my child!
-SARAH JANE: No!

02:06.025 --> 02:08.995
-What am I?
-Oh, Sky, don't be frightened.

02:09.062 --> 02:12.265
You are the hammer
to crush the Metalkind.

02:12.332 --> 02:16.569
You are the weapon and
salvation of our species.
Destroy your enemy!

02:16.636 --> 02:19.272
No, Sky.
You don't have to
destroy anything.

02:19.339 --> 02:20.940
You don't have any enemies.

02:21.007 --> 02:23.142
Just be calm.
Trust me. It's all right.

02:25.345 --> 02:26.579
Sarah Jane?

02:28.047 --> 02:30.083
Everything's
going to be all right.
I promise.

02:30.149 --> 02:32.318
Stop your meddling!

02:32.385 --> 02:35.855
Come with me.
Return home and
fulfil your purpose.

02:40.426 --> 02:42.428
I don't think she
wants to go with you.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.264
I am the child's mother!

02:44.330 --> 02:47.834
Introducing Miss Myers.
She spells it the alien way.

02:47.901 --> 02:53.006
Well, my name is Sarah Jane
Smith and I don't think
you're a fit parent.

02:53.072 --> 02:54.741
She is a weapon!

02:54.807 --> 02:59.145
Grown in
a laboratory to destroy
the enemies of my species.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.548
-I grew her!
-What does she mean?

03:01.614 --> 03:03.349
Oh, don't listen to her, Sky.

03:03.416 --> 03:06.152
Wow, none of us can help
the way we come
into this universe.

03:06.219 --> 03:08.454
But we all have
a say in what we become.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.691
And whatever you had planned
for her, this is an innocent
child, not a weapon.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.326
And I will protect her
from the Metalkind

03:13.393 --> 03:14.861
and I will
protect her from you!

03:15.795 --> 03:16.863
Run!

03:18.431 --> 03:22.201
-Should I stop them?
-I have a better idea.

03:22.268 --> 03:25.471
I have to get you as far away
from that woman as I can.

03:26.306 --> 03:28.107
Is she really my mother?

03:28.174 --> 03:30.209
All I know for sure is
somebody brought you to
me to protect you.

03:30.276 --> 03:31.878
And that's what
I'm going to do.

03:34.747 --> 03:38.918
Have you come
to finish the job, Fleshkind?

03:38.985 --> 03:41.888
Perhaps your weapon
isn't as
powerful as you thought.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.490
The weapon will do its job.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.159
And you're going to help me.

03:48.628 --> 03:49.929
Wire him up.

03:54.434 --> 03:56.703
This is where you live,
I remember.

03:56.769 --> 03:59.005
What, you remember
when you were a baby?

03:59.072 --> 04:01.507
It was only about
half an hour ago.

04:01.574 --> 04:04.911
Why do you call a man
who wears paper
trousers Russell?

04:04.978 --> 04:07.513
-I beg your pardon, hmm?
-It was a joke.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.516
It was meant to be funny, you
know, it was supposed
to make her laugh.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.286
-Boy, does this feel familiar.
-You were telling her jokes?

04:13.353 --> 04:14.921
I was only trying
to stop her from crying.

04:14.988 --> 04:18.391
By making her laugh?
You know what she
does when she laughs.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.858
I like Sid the Sleeve.

04:21.226 --> 04:22.862
You had to be there.
It was great.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.765
Everything's so green.

04:25.832 --> 04:28.201
Well, this is England.
It rains most of the time.

04:28.267 --> 04:31.971
Sky, do you remember
being brought here,
do you remember by who?

04:32.038 --> 04:35.808
-You're the first
thing I remember.
-Oh, I see.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.878
Well,
now that you're grown up,
can you control your powers?

04:40.179 --> 04:41.247
I think so.

04:41.314 --> 04:42.548
Then you've got
to promise that you will,

04:42.615 --> 04:44.784
because I need you
to meet a friend of ours.

04:45.818 --> 04:47.654
Welcome to the Batcave.

04:49.555 --> 04:51.391
There's a cave on
top of the house?

04:51.457 --> 04:54.394
RANI: It's not a cave.
It's an attic.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.530
Clyde was joking again.
He does that. Sort of.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.632
Mr Smith, I need you.

05:01.534 --> 05:04.103
-What's going on?
-It's all right.
Sky won't hurt you.

05:09.742 --> 05:12.045
Wow!

05:12.111 --> 05:13.813
MR SMITH:
<i>Is the child under control?</i>

05:13.880 --> 05:16.449
It's all right. I promise.

05:16.516 --> 05:18.851
-What are you?
-MR SMITH: <i>I am a Xylok.</i>

05:18.918 --> 05:22.588
<i>A crystalline life form with</i>
<i>highly sensitive</i>
<i>cybernetic interfaces.</i>

05:22.655 --> 05:24.624
<i>I would be grateful</i>
<i>if you remain distant.</i>

05:24.691 --> 05:26.626
But can we still be friends?

05:26.693 --> 05:28.728
<i>Provided my</i>
<i>circuits remain intact.</i>

05:28.795 --> 05:33.232
Sky has undergone a
metamorphosis. I need you to
make sure she's unharmed.

05:33.299 --> 05:34.834
Don't worry. It won't hurt.

05:36.836 --> 05:37.937
<i>Scanning.</i>

05:40.239 --> 05:43.409
-It tickles!
<i>-Please, try not to laugh.</i>

05:43.476 --> 05:46.212
Mr Smith, stop fussing
and analyse the scan.

05:46.279 --> 05:49.916
<i>Biologically,</i>
<i>Sky appears to be</i>
<i>a healthy 12-year-old child.</i>

05:49.982 --> 05:51.851
Twelve? Is that a good age?

05:51.918 --> 05:54.020
Well, until the spots start.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.155
Rani, take Sky,
have a look
through Luke's things.

05:56.222 --> 05:57.523
See if you can find
her something to wear.

05:57.590 --> 05:58.858
Sure. Come on, Sky.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.831
Mr Smith, how did she
transform into a teenager?

06:04.897 --> 06:08.568
<i>Sky's synthetic DNA was</i>
<i>programmed for</i>
<i>this level of maturity</i>

06:08.634 --> 06:10.269
<i>to maximize her effectiveness.</i>

06:10.336 --> 06:12.672
-As a weapon?
<i>-As a bomb.</i>

06:12.739 --> 06:16.843
<i>Full activation would not only</i>
<i>destroy Miss Myers' enemies</i>
<i>across the universe,</i>

06:16.909 --> 06:18.077
<i>but also kill Sky.</i>

06:22.582 --> 06:27.286
-Is Sarah Jane Luke's mother?
-Yeah. She adopted him.

06:27.353 --> 06:32.959
But Luke was made by aliens
that wanted to
take over Earth.

06:33.025 --> 06:37.530
I like Earth.
It's beautiful, noisy, smelly.

06:37.597 --> 06:39.499
(LAUGHS) Yeah. It's all that.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.935
This must be so weird for you.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.872
Like, seeing the world
for the first time?

06:45.938 --> 06:48.341
Everyone else, they just
sort of grow up with it.

06:48.407 --> 06:49.776
It's exciting!

06:51.611 --> 06:53.312
Try these.

06:53.379 --> 06:57.250
Now,
they're not exactly fashion
but you'll be all right.

06:57.316 --> 06:58.851
What's fashion?

06:58.918 --> 07:01.888
Well, clothes. Like wearing
nice clothes, made for a girl.

07:03.289 --> 07:04.590
What's a girl?

07:05.691 --> 07:07.126
(SIGHS)

07:07.193 --> 07:10.963
And Clyde thought he had
it tough with Luke. Okay.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.866
Let's log on to Ranipedia!

07:13.933 --> 07:16.869
Why have they done this,
create a child that's a bomb?

07:16.936 --> 07:19.071
What sort of sick
species is Miss Myers?

07:19.138 --> 07:23.209
<i>There is a binary planetary</i>
<i>system at the eye of</i>
<i>the Tornado Nebula.</i>

07:23.276 --> 07:26.546
<i>One has</i>
<i>carbon-based life-forms</i>
<i>similar to those on Earth.</i>

07:26.612 --> 07:28.748
<i>The other evolved</i>
<i>as boron-based life.</i>

07:28.815 --> 07:30.516
And for those of us
who watching the netball team

07:30.583 --> 07:32.151
out the window
during chemistry?

07:32.218 --> 07:34.620
<i>Boron is a metalloid element.</i>

07:34.687 --> 07:38.324
On one planet, people evolved
like us, blood, bones, flesh.

07:38.391 --> 07:39.992
On the other, metal.
That's amazing!

07:40.059 --> 07:42.662
So, this Fleshkind planet,
that's where Sky's from?

07:42.728 --> 07:47.033
<i>Yes. The Metalkind and</i>
<i>Fleshkind have been at</i>
<i>war for centuries.</i>

07:47.099 --> 07:49.869
<i>I believe Sky was created</i>
<i>as a doomsday weapon,</i>

07:49.936 --> 07:51.437
<i>to destroy the Metalkind.</i>

07:51.504 --> 07:53.439
Of all
the terrible things I've seen,

07:53.506 --> 07:57.410
I've never known anything
as hideous as using
a child as a bomb!

07:57.476 --> 07:58.477
What's a bomb?

08:00.413 --> 08:03.449
-Oh, Sky.
-Miss Myers said
I was a weapon.

08:04.350 --> 08:05.585
That's bad, isn't it?

08:06.619 --> 08:08.154
-Am I bad?
-No.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.957
No way. Miss Myers,
she's the bad one, not you.

08:11.023 --> 08:14.660
-What am I, then?
-The thing inside you,

08:14.727 --> 08:19.398
Miss Myers created you like
that to kill her enemies,
the Metalkind.

08:19.465 --> 08:21.067
Kill? What's kill?

08:23.936 --> 08:28.474
To take away life. It dies.
It no longer exists.
And that's wrong.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.042
It's always wrong!

08:30.109 --> 08:33.078
But if that's what I was made
to do, that makes me bad.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.715
No,
because it's not your fault.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.650
Mr Smith, there must
be some way to reverse

08:37.717 --> 08:40.453
-what Miss Myers
been done to her.
<i>-I regret not.</i>

08:40.519 --> 08:43.623
<i>At a molecular level, Sky</i>
<i>is a weapon</i>
<i>programmed to destruct</i>

08:43.688 --> 08:46.692
<i>on contact with the energies</i>
<i>of massed Metalkind.</i>

08:46.759 --> 08:49.862
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>this cannot be undone.</i>

08:49.929 --> 08:53.733
Okay, if she's a bomb,
can't we just defuse her?

08:53.799 --> 08:56.602
Oh, Clyde! That's brilliant!

08:56.669 --> 08:59.372
Turn off the genetic trigger.
Stop her detonating.

08:59.438 --> 09:00.840
Mr Smith, is that possible?

09:00.907 --> 09:03.342
So, genetically she would
still be
a weapon but disarmed?

09:03.409 --> 09:05.678
<i>Only Sky's</i>
<i>creator can do that.</i>

09:05.745 --> 09:07.446
Then let's go ask her!

09:07.513 --> 09:10.082
Sky, it's not going
to be as easy as that.

09:10.149 --> 09:13.486
Taking you back to
the power station,
that's dangerous.

09:13.552 --> 09:14.854
What's "dangerous"?

09:18.491 --> 09:20.559
You could die.

09:20.626 --> 09:22.395
Mr Smith said I
could die anyway.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.531
I don't want to be a bomb.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.067
Sarah Jane, will you help me?

09:33.372 --> 09:35.441
I can't help thinking
this is a bad idea.

09:35.508 --> 09:36.943
I know.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.612
The last thing I want is that
woman anywhere near Sky!

09:39.679 --> 09:41.948
But Miss Myers is the only one
that can deprogram her DNA

09:42.014 --> 09:43.549
so she has to come with us.

09:43.616 --> 09:45.584
Before we get as far as that,
right, small point.

09:45.651 --> 09:47.820
Miss Myers may have put
all the techies into a trance

09:47.887 --> 09:49.689
but that guard
still looks lively.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.824
I don't want to
risk the gates again.

09:51.891 --> 09:54.193
Old investigative
reporter's superstition.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.928
Never break in
the same way twice.

09:58.497 --> 09:59.732
I can do this.

10:11.077 --> 10:13.546
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

10:13.612 --> 10:14.847
(CAR ALARMS SOUNDING)

10:35.634 --> 10:39.005
Now, I need you to stay here
with Clyde and Rani.

10:39.071 --> 10:41.507
-What for?
-Yeah, ditto!

10:41.574 --> 10:44.210
You need to make sure that
Sky is safe until I'm ready.

10:44.276 --> 10:46.545
Oh, great,
so we get babysitting duty?

10:46.612 --> 10:48.447
Who are you calling a baby?

10:48.514 --> 10:50.516
We're doing this
by my rules, Sky.

10:50.583 --> 10:53.452
Until I can convince Miss
Myers that there's another
way to end this war,

10:53.519 --> 10:55.421
a peaceful way,
then you're still in danger.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.224
And I need you to stay here
with Clyde and Rani.
Now, do you promise me?

10:58.290 --> 11:00.693
-I suppose.
-Right.

11:12.371 --> 11:13.139
Oh!

11:20.312 --> 11:24.050
Oh! Good.
Now, take me to your leader.

11:30.556 --> 11:33.392
-She might need our help.
-She told us to stay here.

11:33.459 --> 11:37.463
Do you always do
what Sarah Jane tells you to?

11:37.530 --> 11:40.366
Look, this is a nuclear power
station, which makes going
in there with you

11:40.433 --> 11:44.370
like doing a Houses
of Parliament tour
with Guy Fawkes.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.005
What are you talking about?

11:46.072 --> 11:49.108
He means it's not safe.
Anyway, you promised.

11:49.175 --> 11:50.876
I don't really
understand promises.

11:52.178 --> 11:53.879
Hey, wait!

11:53.946 --> 11:55.848
That kid's going to get
us in so much trouble!

12:04.390 --> 12:06.892
MYERS: Miss Smith.
Welcome back.

12:08.027 --> 12:08.928
Complete your work.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.802
I trust you're taking
good care of my child?

12:16.869 --> 12:18.237
Yes.

12:18.304 --> 12:21.107
You won't be getting
your hands on her again.

12:21.173 --> 12:23.042
Don't judge me.

12:23.109 --> 12:26.612
Do you think I like what this
war has forced me
to do, to become?

12:26.679 --> 12:29.148
Then I'm asking you,
deactivate what
you've done to Sky.

12:29.215 --> 12:32.384
Deactivate?
She is our saviour.

12:32.451 --> 12:36.989
Her touch carries the power
and the fury of
an exploding sun.

12:37.056 --> 12:40.960
Once fully unleashed,
it will destroy
every Metalkind in existence.

12:41.026 --> 12:42.962
And Sky will be destroyed
along with them!

12:43.028 --> 12:45.965
A sacrifice for
the preservation
of the Fleshkind.

12:46.031 --> 12:49.168
That's not a sacrifice.
That's slaughter!

12:49.235 --> 12:53.038
Listen to me, please.
There are other
ways to end a war.

12:53.105 --> 12:56.842
You just have to want peace
more than death.

12:56.909 --> 12:59.111
(SIGHS) You know nothing.

13:00.913 --> 13:04.383
For centuries the Metalkind
have savaged my people.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.752
They have sworn to
destroy all flesh.

13:06.819 --> 13:11.323
And what chance does flesh
have against the jaws and
blades of iron and steel?

13:11.390 --> 13:12.858
But perhaps you will learn!

13:18.230 --> 13:19.999
What is this?

13:20.065 --> 13:23.369
The child damaged the
Metalkind just enough for
me to make use of it.

13:23.435 --> 13:26.705
-As a homing device.
-A homing device? For what?

13:26.772 --> 13:29.008
It is being wired
into the nuclear core.

13:29.074 --> 13:32.011
At the flick of a switch,
it will summon all Metalkind

13:32.077 --> 13:34.180
and they will swarm here
in their hordes.

13:34.246 --> 13:36.482
You're bringing
your war to Earth?

13:36.549 --> 13:40.619
Once your flesh can
experience Metalkind savagery,

13:40.686 --> 13:43.822
you will
realise that the child
will save us all.

13:43.889 --> 13:46.625

13:46.692 --> 13:50.262

nothing to hurt your people!

<i>our planet's womb to</i>
<i>make their dumb slaves.</i>

13:56.302 --> 13:58.837
<i>They stole our children.</i>

<i>on all Fleshkind,</i>
<i>on any world!</i>

He thinks he's calling all
Metalkind to a glorious
battle against Flesh,

14:11.050 --> 14:12.751
not to its destruction.

14:13.752 --> 14:15.754
You're wasting your time.

14:15.821 --> 14:18.857
-I will never give you Sky!
-It doesn't matter.

14:18.924 --> 14:21.594
The child is primed
to activate on exposure

14:21.660 --> 14:23.796
to the massed
energy of the Metalkind.

14:23.862 --> 14:27.132
When they come,
they will be destroyed.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.635
She cannot stop it.
And neither can you!

What is it?

14:47.820 --> 14:49.688

I can feel them.
They're coming!

14:49.755 --> 14:51.624

14:58.931 --> 15:02.001
If you bring
the Metalkind to Earth,
you're worse than they are.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.203
You're bringing war
an innocent planet!

15:04.270 --> 15:06.205
This is survival.

15:06.272 --> 15:08.941
But there's still time
before I open the portal.

15:09.008 --> 15:12.311
Bring the child to me and I
will take her home
to face our enemy

15:12.378 --> 15:16.081
and your planet
will never know
the butchery of the Metalkind!

15:16.148 --> 15:18.717
What would you put first,
Miss Smith?

15:18.784 --> 15:20.986
One child or
your entire world?

15:23.355 --> 15:26.125
Wait and see!

15:26.191 --> 15:30.863
Whatever you choose,
Sarah Jane Smith,
Sky will fulfil her destiny!

15:35.367 --> 15:37.770
Sky! I thought I told
you to keep her away!

15:37.836 --> 15:39.271
She says
the Metalkind are coming.

15:39.338 --> 15:40.939
I've got to stop them!

15:41.006 --> 15:43.909
No! Wars are ended by
people talking,
not by killing.

15:43.976 --> 15:46.011
But Earth won't
stand a chance!

15:46.078 --> 15:49.081
You've been kind
to me, Sarah Jane.
You've tried to keep me safe.

15:49.148 --> 15:50.949
But this is what
I was created for.

15:51.016 --> 15:55.087
Sky, listen to me.
This is wrong.
Killing is always wrong.

15:55.154 --> 15:57.856
If you confront the Metalkind,
you will die.

15:57.923 --> 16:00.159
If I don't, you will!

16:00.225 --> 16:02.861
Maybe this is why I was
brought here, to save Earth.

CLYDE: Sky!

16:09.068 --> 16:10.569

-No. I'll go after Sky,

16:10.636 --> 16:12.438
you get to the control room

16:12.504 --> 16:14.340
and shut down
the reactor to stop
the Metalkind coming through!

16:14.406 --> 16:17.109
Shut down a nuclear reactor?
How exactly are we
supposed to do that?

This is what controls

Pull out the rods, close
the reactor and
save the world.

17:32.418 --> 17:34.286
Only this is like
James Bond meets Mario.

17:34.353 --> 17:36.622
Which is ace,

brilliant at Mario.
