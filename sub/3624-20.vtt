You should be hearing from him

Ugh. Ok. Round one

Kim, this isn't
just "some guy."

What is the sitch?!

10:09.610 --> 10:12.677
Hey, I was the kissee here,
not the kisser.

10:12.679 --> 10:15.847
It took you 12 stinkin'
years to kiss me.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.682
Oh, whew!
Hey, wait a minute.

10:17.684 --> 10:19.184
I don't know what you're up to,

10:19.186 --> 10:21.152
but this is a new low,
even for you.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.455
Oh, yeah, well,
speaking of low...

10:23.457 --> 10:24.789
which I am.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.758
You... you're...

10:26.760 --> 10:29.227
well?
Well, I...

10:29.229 --> 10:31.363

Ok, um, er.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.537
Uh, I don't speak hysterics.

Br... Br... Up...

10:47.180 --> 10:48.346
W...Eeee!

10:48.348 --> 10:50.448
How do you know
what she's saying?

10:50.450 --> 10:53.451
It's a girl thing.
So I'm the rebound guy?

10:53.453 --> 10:56.921
Cool! I've never been
the rebound guy.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.289
Uh, but, you know,

10:58.291 --> 10:59.891
it's not as wonderful

10:59.893 --> 11:02.560
as being your guy.

11:02.562 --> 11:03.995
Bonnie, uh,

11:03.997 --> 11:05.830
I wish I could help.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.833
Me? Needing help
from you?

11:08.835 --> 11:10.301
I should be horrified.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.871
But I don't even
have my pride any more.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.305
Fine. I accept.

11:14.307 --> 11:20.245
Ok. There's plenty
of seniors out there

11:20.247 --> 11:23.381
what about Rotiffle?
Never heard of him.

11:23.383 --> 11:28.820
No, he's the idol of serious
snackers everywhere.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.222
Do not tell me
he's missing again.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.291
Who cares?
I have a real problem here.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.560
Which is much more
important than my mission.

11:35.562 --> 11:36.828
Finally, you're getting it.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.397
Ok. We'll split
into teams.

11:39.399 --> 11:40.832
[Bell rings]

11:40.834 --> 11:43.468
I want somebody else

This will work.

11:46.239 --> 11:49.374
Thank you for coming.
Go, mad dogs.

11:54.581 --> 11:55.847
Hey, tiny.
Yo.

11:55.849 --> 11:59.551
"Big" was not a shot about
your size, by the way.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.486
It's about how she is so hugely

12:01.488 --> 12:04.289
not into you,
so no hard feelings?

12:04.291 --> 12:10.528
You know, you bear a strong
resemblance to my favorite queen.

12:10.530 --> 12:13.965
Idalia of the planet grocknoss.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.301
This is not happening to me.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.680
Oh, yeah.
The geek thing pays.

12:28.682 --> 12:30.415
How are you
at gate-jumping.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.884
I don't usually
find it necessary.

12:32.886 --> 12:35.320
[Beeps] [Gate squeaks]

12:41.495 --> 12:43.328
No problem. Hmm.

"Compatibility

Genius light reading, anyone?

12:52.439 --> 12:54.506
Look out!

12:57.009 --> 12:58.676
Oof!

13:01.814 --> 13:04.415
That must be the M.D.D.

13:16.562 --> 13:19.430
I think we can safely
call this "foul play."

13:19.432 --> 13:22.300
Wow. Those super-genius
analytical skills

13:22.302 --> 13:24.969
really come in handy
in the field.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.337
This is a waste.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.872
Oh, come on.
You haven't even gotten

13:27.874 --> 13:31.843
to the world rap Cuban
techno-blues jazz section.

13:32.378 --> 13:35.413
I just want a regular,
normal, shallow hottie,

preferably not too bright.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.026
Didn't crack the code yet, huh?

13:48.028 --> 13:50.762
But I'll decrypt
Ricky's computer.

13:50.764 --> 13:52.063
That, I'm not worried about.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.531
It's the
Bonnie-boyfriend code.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.367
Yeah, which frankly
cannot be cracked.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.040
Well, it's not easy!
Got it!

14:02.042 --> 14:03.875
The last web search Ricky made

14:03.877 --> 14:04.976
was for venice, Italy.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.044
We've gotta move fast.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.378
All right,
you got it, K.P.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.646
What about me?

14:08.648 --> 14:10.815
Well, I mean, you could
come along, I guess.

14:10.817 --> 14:13.384
Not sure that's a great idea.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.486
So you would ditch me
in my darkest hour?

14:15.488 --> 14:17.422
Bonnie, it's just that, um...

14:17.424 --> 14:19.657
When it comes to
heartless cruelty,

14:19.659 --> 14:23.695
anything is possible
for a possible.

14:25.130 --> 14:27.765
Really appreciate the lift,
mister banana.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.133
I said thanks
for the lift, coco!

14:29.135 --> 14:32.070
And he promised he'd be
back for homecoming.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.706
Snap! Oh, no,
he didn't.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.407

So simple. So pliable.

not deserve you.

14:43.617 --> 14:46.417
There's gotta be a guy
out there for Bonnie.

There is, my friend.

girlfriend.

it's a little harsh

15:12.879 --> 15:16.180
to call her the "mean
girl." She's got... ok, yeah.

15:16.182 --> 15:18.616
I mean, that's true,
she's pretty bossy.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.551
And she can be cruel,
but, I mean, come on,

15:20.553 --> 15:23.955

we love about her? Hey.

So?

You know, college has
actually made him smarter.

15:31.464 --> 15:34.465
He's completely moved on.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.107
Actually, no, um...
Then I cannot help you.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.976
Well, if you could just
look at the picture, uh...

15:44.978 --> 15:47.445
Oh, so you need my assistance
in an investigation?

15:47.447 --> 15:51.015
Yes. That, too,
requires a reservation.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.660
Can I help you, signorina?

16:02.662 --> 16:04.562
I need a boyfriend.
Then no.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.732
And they're looking for some
missing computer geek.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.635
Hmm. I saw
such a geek earlier.

16:10.637 --> 16:14.472
He was with another
young man with nice hair.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.873
They went that way.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.208
You're sure she meant
this museum?

16:17.210 --> 16:19.944
Absolutely.
I shouldn't have come here.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.212
It's all too beautiful.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.747
I brought you a surprise.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.816
Might make you feel better.

The symbol of my superiority!

A little.

Excuse me.

Oh, she's not really,
um, you know...

16:42.769 --> 16:44.702

16:44.704 --> 16:46.104
You may cast your gaze upon me.

Where, where, where is she?

16:54.614 --> 16:57.281
I'm hungry.
I want to eat now!

Ah, a definite royalty.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.085
My dear friends,
you must join me

17:01.087 --> 17:02.754
for this afternoon's regatta.

17:02.756 --> 17:07.558
But I'd rather look
at boats instead.

[Retching]

17:15.835 --> 17:18.236
I wonder if you might
help us find someone.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.538
Venice is my home.
If I can help...

17:27.212 --> 17:30.214
I know who captured Ricky.

He's threatening Ricky
right now.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.158
There, see?

We've got to catch
the criminal now.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.800
[Speaks italian]

17:48.802 --> 17:52.236
Exactly.
Look out, junior.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.771
He hasn't seen us yet.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.773
Junior, pull your boat over!

17:55.775 --> 17:58.142

time for this.

Ha ha ha ha!

18:10.322 --> 18:11.889
Why are they chasing me?

18:11.891 --> 18:13.891
I have no desire
to speak to them.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.259
Please do not crash my boat!

Don't worry!
She can do anything.

18:27.306 --> 18:28.372
I must warn you.

In my way is a bad place to be.

Uh. Ugh.

19:06.345 --> 19:08.179
They got away.
Now what?

19:08.181 --> 19:11.315
I think we know
where to find him.

19:15.921 --> 19:17.321
Everyone ok?

19:17.323 --> 19:20.191
Even in Italy,
nobody wanted me.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.325
Ugh, there she goes.

19:21.327 --> 19:25.029
Well, you could have fooled me.
What was that?

19:25.031 --> 19:26.931
Uh, you can count on me.

19:26.933 --> 19:30.334
Just as soon as we
wrap things up here.

19:31.737 --> 19:35.206
Looks like the seniors have
upgraded their security.

19:36.943 --> 19:40.845
This one rolls through
a variety of frequencies

19:40.847 --> 19:41.913
on a random basis.

19:41.915 --> 19:44.448
Ok. A very special
laser grid.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.816
This is a disaster.

19:45.818 --> 19:50.121
Then what? Where does the
downward spiral take me?

19:50.123 --> 19:52.890
Oh, no. What if I end up...

19:52.892 --> 19:55.893
Uh, Bonnie, this is
the part of sneaking in

19:55.895 --> 19:58.329
that we like
to call quiet time.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.097
Fine.

Can you shut it down?

See the control box
way over there?

20:04.971 --> 20:06.971
Super magnet.
Go for it.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.106
[Beeps]

20:12.144 --> 20:13.844
You should come along
more often.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.080
It is nice to get out.

20:19.418 --> 20:23.754
Can't we sneak
any faster? Hmm!

and I want them now.

Ok, hold on, amigo.
I'm trying.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.900

the meaning of this?

How dare you
interrupt my quest.

Worry not, snack man.
You're safe now. Again.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.377
So what's junior
forcing you to do?

20:46.379 --> 20:50.314
You see, uh, well, he's not
forcing as much as paying.

20:50.316 --> 20:52.316
What? He hired me
to use the M.D.D.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.151
As a global data crunch.
Objective?

20:54.153 --> 20:56.053
To find his perfect love match.

20:56.055 --> 20:59.390
Junior captured you to
search the personals?

20:59.392 --> 21:02.493
I will not be ridiculed
on matters of the heart.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.929
My plan is to search
the entire world

21:04.931 --> 21:08.432

the girl of my dreams.

21:09.234 --> 21:11.269

21:11.271 --> 21:13.771
It takes.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.274
[Gasps]

21:18.844 --> 21:20.811
Yeah...

21:20.813 --> 21:22.213
So it wasn't so much

21:22.215 --> 21:24.415
that he captured me, as...

21:24.417 --> 21:28.319
señor senior junior
pays extremely well.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.387
Ron: He's a bad guy!

21:29.389 --> 21:33.057
At first I thought I could
whip up a new program,

21:33.059 --> 21:34.325
but it was too much data.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.193
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

21:36.195 --> 21:40.197
to find the right combo of
shallow, selfish, and insensitive,

21:40.199 --> 21:42.033
but still hot enough
for this guy?

21:42.035 --> 21:43.167
Yeah...
Actually...

21:43.169 --> 21:45.970
We've got a pretty good idea.

21:53.545 --> 21:55.579
[Bonnie sighs]

21:57.582 --> 22:01.185
Well, I guess our trip to
venice really was a success.

22:01.187 --> 22:04.021
Mm-hmm. We got to see
a beautiful city,

22:04.023 --> 22:05.423
have a semi-romantic
boat ride,

22:05.425 --> 22:08.159
and it put an end
to the queen-kissing.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.094
Now, wait. You know
that I didn't...

22:10.096 --> 22:11.862
it's ok. I get it.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.198
[Bonnie giggles] Oh, junior.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.167
So happy ending.

22:16.169 --> 22:19.270
Yup. Weird happy ending.

22:21.606 --> 22:23.240
Bonnie: Don't go anywhere,
Stoppable.

22:23.242 --> 22:24.909
That dweeb from
the yearbook committee

22:24.911 --> 22:27.244
insists that we pose
for a royal portrait.

22:27.246 --> 22:30.181
A picture of me
with you in the yearbook.

22:30.183 --> 22:33.184
That's like photograph
evidence that we associated.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.219
You know, some of us
learn and grow

22:35.221 --> 22:36.487
from our little adventures.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.556
Whatever, loser.
