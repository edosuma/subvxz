WEBVTT

00:04.871 --> 00:05.872
Tonight,

00:06.206 --> 00:07.841
Bella LaRouche
has chosen a theme.

00:08.108 --> 00:10.176
Ladies choose their partners.

00:10.443 --> 00:11.411
Bella started her journey

00:11.745 --> 00:12.879
through some
other neighborhoods, too,

00:13.213 --> 00:16.463
ones with more
experimental architecture.

00:16.783 --> 00:17.717
Where do you come up
with that stuff?

00:18.051 --> 00:19.119
Are you shooting food porn?

00:19.452 --> 00:20.687
I need a creative
outlet, okay?

00:21.034 --> 00:22.389
You know that I haven't
been feeling fulfilled lately.

00:22.702 --> 00:24.004
I'm looking
for my next gig here.

00:24.324 --> 00:25.939
Just waiting for the stars
to align.

00:26.259 --> 00:27.474
You'll be fine.
Everyone loves you.

00:27.794 --> 00:30.497
What do you say
we drive up the coast...

00:30.797 --> 00:32.298
get lost where
no one can reach us?

00:32.545 --> 00:33.533
You brought Constance in,

00:33.833 --> 00:34.901
you pitched her
the global vision,

00:35.268 --> 00:36.369
and now, you're about
to make it happen.

00:36.669 --> 00:38.471
- You should run the thing.
- Yeah.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.040
Why don't you
make us a cocktail,

00:40.440 --> 00:43.543
and we'll have a little chat
about this company's future?

00:43.690 --> 00:44.911
And yours.

00:45.245 --> 00:46.746
If we get on the cover
of Rolling Stone,

00:47.080 --> 00:49.749
it'll launch us
to outer fucking space.

00:59.092 --> 01:00.794
Oh, sorry.
I, uh, thought you'd be gone.

01:01.094 --> 01:02.796
Flight's not
for a couple hours.

01:03.163 --> 01:05.565
Two full days in the office
between trips, Joycie?

01:05.932 --> 01:07.233
Careful, somebody might think
you work here.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.102
Vassar is thanking me
for endowing

01:09.436 --> 01:11.438
the new Fellowship
for Women in Print.

01:11.771 --> 01:13.206
Whole English department
will be there.

01:13.473 --> 01:14.441
How much is that gonna cost ya?

01:14.707 --> 01:16.009
It's not about the money, Doug.

01:16.443 --> 01:18.411
It's about smoothing the path
for the women who follow me.

01:18.778 --> 01:20.914
Hey! That is my wall!

01:21.281 --> 01:22.849
- What are you--
- Yeah, it used to be mine.

01:23.183 --> 01:25.985
Oh, my God, please do not be
a murder weapon.

01:26.319 --> 01:28.188
No, no, no.
I put this here for safekeeping

01:28.455 --> 01:29.823
after I got out over my skis

01:30.123 --> 01:31.558
with a waitress
at Trader Vic's.

01:32.892 --> 01:34.594
Oh, my God.

01:34.861 --> 01:36.262
You're proposing to Tina?

01:36.529 --> 01:37.530
Yeah, the timing's right.

01:37.864 --> 01:39.499
I can't go to Europe
without that woman.

01:39.732 --> 01:41.034
There's a time difference.

01:41.367 --> 01:42.502
You know, and then the...
and then the cost

01:42.869 --> 01:44.137
of international calls
is... is through the roof.

01:44.370 --> 01:45.605
Okay, couple notes.

01:46.005 --> 01:48.842
Um, how heavily do logistics
feature in this proposal?

01:49.075 --> 01:50.210
Ah, don't worry, Joycie.

01:50.577 --> 01:51.878
This isn't my first time
around the marriage block.

01:52.178 --> 01:53.179
Maybe don't mention that, either.

01:53.513 --> 01:54.714
It's her mother's
big retirement thing,

01:55.081 --> 01:56.749
so I'm just gonna slide
in there as we're getting ready

01:57.050 --> 01:58.685
and I'm gonna tell her that, um...

02:01.354 --> 02:02.622
...just gonna tell her
that she's the first person

02:02.922 --> 02:05.492
I want to tell my news to,
you know?

02:05.692 --> 02:06.493
Good or bad.

02:06.759 --> 02:08.895
And that my life does not...

02:09.142 --> 02:10.563
doesn't make any sense
without her.

02:10.897 --> 02:12.398
And when I met her,
everything just kind of

02:12.665 --> 02:14.067
changed for me for the better.

02:15.568 --> 02:16.636
You know, something like that.

02:17.003 --> 02:18.938
I think of you two
as only existing at work,

02:19.239 --> 02:20.707
but you have
this whole other life

02:20.940 --> 02:22.876
that is just so beautiful.

02:23.209 --> 02:25.512
Jeez, Prigger.
I never took you for a sap.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.848
Marriage is still
a patriarchal prison

02:29.115 --> 02:30.396
akin to indentured servitude.

02:30.617 --> 02:32.185
And there she is.

02:32.519 --> 02:33.419
That better be fixed
when I get back

02:33.620 --> 02:34.754
from Poughkeepsie.

02:46.199 --> 02:49.169
♪ All around the world
I'd rather be a fly ♪

02:49.469 --> 02:51.004
♪ I'd light on my baby... ♪

02:51.371 --> 02:52.939
Of course it's free.
It's included.

02:53.106 --> 02:53.940
Hello.

02:54.207 --> 02:55.575
Here you are.

02:55.822 --> 02:57.010
- And for you.
- Oh!

02:57.277 --> 02:58.912
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

02:59.879 --> 03:02.882
Ah!

03:03.082 --> 03:04.617
Mm!

03:04.984 --> 03:06.452
When was the last time
we had a moment alone,

03:06.653 --> 03:07.453
you and me?

03:07.654 --> 03:08.855
And listen,

03:09.222 --> 03:11.724
it's been a whirlwind
at the Lambert house.

03:11.991 --> 03:13.560
Lots to report.

03:13.893 --> 03:15.428
I cannot wait
to show you campus.

03:15.662 --> 03:16.729
It's gonna be great.

03:17.096 --> 03:18.565
I just... I have
to do this one little speech,

03:18.898 --> 03:20.466
and then
it's just gonna be you and me.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.369
Oh, I wanna see all the stuff
you used to write home about,

03:23.636 --> 03:25.071
like the... the Rose Parlor?

03:25.338 --> 03:27.106
And the strawberry scones, yes.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.509
And you'll get to meet
Professor Merrim.

03:29.809 --> 03:31.811
Oh!
The famous Professor Merrim.

03:32.078 --> 03:33.112
She's where it all started!

03:33.313 --> 03:34.814
I... you know...

03:35.094 --> 03:36.316
I could barely string
a sentence together

03:36.583 --> 03:37.350
when I got to Vassar.

03:37.584 --> 03:38.451
Oh, that's not true.

03:38.751 --> 03:39.532
On your sixth-grade
report card,

03:39.766 --> 03:41.334
it said,
"aggressive with words."

03:41.754 --> 03:44.057
I was flailing compared
to the boarding school girls.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.793
But she... she saw something--

03:47.126 --> 03:48.494
I don't know--
special in me, you know?

03:48.828 --> 03:51.531
I remember she sat me down
and she said,

03:51.864 --> 03:54.467
"Stop worrying
about what other people hear

03:54.801 --> 03:57.837
and fall in love
with your own unique voice."

03:58.137 --> 04:00.106
- Gosh. I like her already.
- Yeah.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.041
She's the only person
I can imagine

04:02.342 --> 04:03.476
writing the prologue for my book.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.144
Bringing it full-circle.

04:05.478 --> 04:07.480
I mean, there's poetry in that, Joycie.

04:16.456 --> 04:17.323
Who wants melon?

04:17.624 --> 04:20.093
It's Saturday.
Why are you here?

04:20.493 --> 04:22.362
I knew you'd be here working,
so I brought you brunch.

04:22.629 --> 04:23.396
- Oh.
- Bellini?

04:23.630 --> 04:24.998
Oh, no. I can't.

04:25.331 --> 04:27.634
My new agent wants
an updated portfolio,

04:28.001 --> 04:31.304
including a self-portrait
that shows the real me,

04:31.504 --> 04:32.305
whoever that is.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.243
You ready?

04:37.577 --> 04:39.579
Old headshot's not cutting it.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.447
I forgot you came to LA to act!

04:41.714 --> 04:43.696
And dance.

04:48.968 --> 04:51.357
- Mm.
- Oh, I thought you'd sip it.

04:52.859 --> 04:54.060
What did you do?

04:54.260 --> 04:55.561
It's from NASA.

04:55.762 --> 04:56.863
What's from NASA?

04:57.196 --> 04:58.831
The pill I cut into quarters,
ground up,

04:59.165 --> 05:00.633
and muddled
into the peach juice.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.702
It's called M-D-M...

05:03.002 --> 05:05.471
something.
Letters don't matter.

05:05.738 --> 05:07.140
Bambi, we talked about this.

05:07.373 --> 05:08.241
I know. I just...

05:08.541 --> 05:09.876
I wanted to talk
about our feelings

05:10.209 --> 05:12.445
and go on a healing journey,
you know?

05:12.745 --> 05:13.713
The work will figure
itself out.

05:14.013 --> 05:14.981
Drugs are great
for inspiration.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.629
I know.

05:16.863 --> 05:19.085
That's why I'm already on them.

05:19.352 --> 05:20.219
I took two purple nurples

05:20.520 --> 05:21.888
the second I got
off the freeway.

05:22.221 --> 05:24.290
I guess the only
responsible thing to do is

05:24.624 --> 05:26.426
give me two of those
so we're on the same ride.

05:26.626 --> 05:28.094
What kind of ride?

05:28.361 --> 05:30.563
I'm guessing... a fast one?

05:39.739 --> 05:40.940
Hey, good-lookin'.

05:41.187 --> 05:44.444
Oh, no!
Now I have to start over!

05:44.757 --> 05:46.926
You know how my mom is
about my makeup, my hair.

05:47.213 --> 05:47.947
Yeah, your everything.

05:48.214 --> 05:49.615
Hey, can I get a minute

05:49.916 --> 05:51.584
to chat with you
before the party?

05:51.951 --> 05:54.187
I forgot to tell you
you're off the hook tonight.

05:54.387 --> 05:55.321
Trust me.

05:55.621 --> 05:56.669
It's the last place
you wanna be.

05:56.956 --> 05:57.957
What are you talking about?

05:58.157 --> 05:59.225
Mom retiring?

05:59.559 --> 06:00.193
Marvin taking over
the stationery store?

06:00.426 --> 06:01.627
It's gonna be intense.

06:01.894 --> 06:03.096
Those are more reasons

06:03.463 --> 06:05.198
why I should be there as
somebody who's more than your==

06:05.565 --> 06:07.567
My family doesn't know
that we're back together.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.569
Are you kidding me?

06:09.802 --> 06:11.437
You didn't tell them?

06:11.771 --> 06:13.406
They weren't thrilled
the first time.

06:13.673 --> 06:15.274
- Then we broke up...
- Okay.

06:15.575 --> 06:16.676
Then you married someone else.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.277
And they were actually happy
about that, but...

06:18.444 --> 06:19.412
Okay.

06:19.612 --> 06:20.413
The second time?

06:20.680 --> 06:21.814
Okay, okay, okay. Tins, look.

06:22.181 --> 06:24.751
We have had a lot of zags,
but this is different.

06:24.984 --> 06:27.053
This is our zig. Okay?

06:27.286 --> 06:28.154
So call your mother

06:28.454 --> 06:29.655
and tell her
we are back together

06:29.956 --> 06:31.791
and let me handle the rest, okay?

06:33.426 --> 06:34.374
Okay.

06:34.627 --> 06:35.628
Oh, that's, uh...

06:35.962 --> 06:36.943
that's where
Persephone Rising gathered

06:37.263 --> 06:38.931
- to celebrate the equinox.
- Oh!

06:39.298 --> 06:40.633
Well, it sounded silly
when you told me about it,

06:40.867 --> 06:41.868
but now that we're here,

06:42.168 --> 06:43.236
I kind of wanna throw on
a white dress

06:43.469 --> 06:45.438
and a flower crown.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.507
That's Cushing House,
home of The Miscellany.

06:47.774 --> 06:48.721
And where's the Rose Parlor?

06:49.041 --> 06:50.476
I could really go
for some scones.

06:50.777 --> 06:53.179
Um, we already took our break.

06:53.479 --> 06:54.861
What, when I peed
at New Rochelle?

06:55.148 --> 06:57.116
And we lost five minutes? Yes.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.018
I had to wash my hands.

06:59.285 --> 07:00.987
I don't mean to be so rigid.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.055
We're all just very excited
to have an icon

07:03.356 --> 07:05.191
of sexual liberation
back among us.

07:05.558 --> 07:07.827
Never apologize for
complimenting me to my face.

07:09.662 --> 07:10.863
It's an honor to be back,

07:11.230 --> 07:14.167
reaching out a hand
to lift up the next generation.

07:14.467 --> 07:15.601
That's from my speech.
Too much?

07:15.835 --> 07:16.769
Almost not enough.

07:24.143 --> 07:28.214
Oh, look at this, Joycie.

07:28.514 --> 07:29.816
You think Jackie O
got this turnout

07:30.049 --> 07:31.284
when she came back?

07:31.651 --> 07:34.987
Well, yeah,
but her husband had just died.

07:35.254 --> 07:36.222
Where's, uh, Professor Merrim?

07:36.422 --> 07:37.356
Uh, office hours.

07:37.657 --> 07:38.391
But she'll be here
for the event.

07:38.658 --> 07:39.692
Of course. Great, no.

07:39.992 --> 07:40.993
I would never wanna steal
her away

07:41.327 --> 07:42.495
from shaping the minds
of tomorrow.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.664
That's where she gave me
my first sip of whiskey.

07:45.031 --> 07:46.899
Oh, I wouldn't mind a drink.
Should we find a bar?

07:47.233 --> 07:48.734
Actually, Joyce has
President Simpson

07:48.935 --> 07:50.503
right now for ten.

07:50.670 --> 07:51.671
Oh.

07:51.938 --> 07:54.240
- Um...
- Go, go. I'm a big girl.

07:54.507 --> 07:55.241
- You sure?
- Yes, yes!

07:55.508 --> 07:56.843
Okay, great. Bye!

07:57.009 --> 07:58.811
Oh.

08:08.387 --> 08:10.156
Just pick a genre!

08:10.389 --> 08:11.657
Everything's good!

08:11.891 --> 08:13.426
No, it's not right.

08:13.759 --> 08:15.728
There's a perfect song,
and I'm gonna find it.

08:16.095 --> 08:18.831
It's not the song that matters,
it's who you jam with.

08:19.065 --> 08:20.433
Wrong!

08:20.733 --> 08:21.767
When I listen to music
with family,

08:22.034 --> 08:23.102
everything sounds right.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.104
We're not family.

08:25.404 --> 08:26.806
We're friends
who work together.

08:27.039 --> 08:28.608
That is so mean.

08:28.941 --> 08:31.344
It's not.
I-it's a statement of fact.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.079
Why do you wanna hurt me?

08:33.312 --> 08:36.282
I don't! I love you!

08:36.616 --> 08:39.819
Then why are you screaming?

08:40.086 --> 08:41.554
You're in Joyce's office.

08:41.787 --> 08:42.655
And you're in Doug's.

08:42.955 --> 08:44.390
- Bad vibes!
- Oh, my God!

08:44.724 --> 08:46.292
Ah! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

08:48.427 --> 08:51.264
Did you at least tell your mom
that I'm driving a Rolls?

08:51.597 --> 08:53.299
I feel like you should've led
with that.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.301
We didn't discuss
what you're currently driving.

08:55.668 --> 08:57.370
I feel like
she might've been impressed.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.218
Hey, hey. You tickled me.

08:59.572 --> 09:01.073
That's my...
that's my ticklish spot.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.441
Since when are you ticklish?

09:02.775 --> 09:04.043
Oh, you get older,
you can't drink as much,

09:04.410 --> 09:05.811
you can't run as fast,
and you get ticklish.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.147
What do you want me to say?

09:08.481 --> 09:09.515
How you feeling?
You feeling ready for this?

09:09.815 --> 09:11.083
- This is a big night.
- Are you ready?

09:11.317 --> 09:12.251
Don't worry about me.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.120
Call my mom Mrs. Lewis,
not Evelyn.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.254
Okay, of course.

09:15.588 --> 09:16.756
The silent guy
with the captain's hat

09:17.123 --> 09:18.791
is not her boyfriend,
he's her bachelor companion.

09:19.158 --> 09:21.007
- And the hat is not for show.
- The man is a hero.

09:21.327 --> 09:22.628
Whatever you do,
don't mention Midway.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.397
You brought this sack of shit?

09:24.664 --> 09:25.998
Hey, Ruby. Good to see ya.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.068
I thought you said that

09:29.435 --> 09:30.970
your sister liked me the best
out of everybody.

09:31.203 --> 09:32.672
She does.

09:32.939 --> 09:35.308
It's an honor to be back.

09:35.541 --> 09:38.144
And I have one request.

09:38.377 --> 09:40.379
Don't just surprise me.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.048
Surprise yourselves.

09:49.555 --> 09:50.823
Thank you, thank you.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.191
Thank you, Ms. Prigger.

09:52.558 --> 09:54.527
One of our most accomplished
and generous alumni.

09:54.694 --> 09:55.795
Mm-hmm.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.331
And now, in your honor,
the Night Owls.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.080
You want this
to be mom's retirement

10:14.313 --> 10:15.114
and her funeral?

10:15.381 --> 10:16.349
I knew this was a bad idea.

10:16.682 --> 10:17.717
I'm here to help,
not be a problem.

10:18.050 --> 10:20.419
Too late.
Let's just get this over with.

10:21.854 --> 10:24.156
Mama, congratulations!

10:24.357 --> 10:25.625
Ah! You're late.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.660
Hey, my man.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.229
Mwah.

10:30.496 --> 10:31.464
Where's Doug sitting?

10:31.764 --> 10:32.465
I'm good to sit right here
next to my--

10:32.698 --> 10:34.567
Sorry, man. No room.

10:35.534 --> 10:37.536
Don't slap your brother.
He's a sensitive boy.

10:37.903 --> 10:40.740
You called so late,
I couldn't get a bigger table.

10:40.940 --> 10:42.375
But don't worry.

10:42.708 --> 10:45.211
We'll find a spot
for your supervisor.

10:48.681 --> 10:50.082
Listen, if my eldest

10:50.416 --> 10:53.319
would just ejaculate
into one dedicated sock

10:53.686 --> 10:55.554
instead of anything
that was close at hand,

10:55.921 --> 10:58.024
I tell you,
I would save years on laundry.

10:58.290 --> 10:59.892
Years!

11:00.259 --> 11:02.895
The point is, that stain
will come out, no problem.

11:03.095 --> 11:04.397
Club soda, salt.

11:04.697 --> 11:07.066
Soak, yes.

11:09.602 --> 11:13.072
Oh, Joycie! Oh, you were great.

11:13.439 --> 11:15.441
Let me introduce you
to my new friend, Doreen.

11:15.808 --> 11:18.878
We met at the bar,
but we bonded over petit fours.

11:19.111 --> 11:20.479
Professor Merrim!

11:20.746 --> 11:22.381
Wait, you're Professor Merrim?

11:22.715 --> 11:24.750
- You can call me Doreen now.
- Okay.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.185
Hi, Doreen.

11:26.485 --> 11:27.520
I can't...
This is Professor Merrim.

11:27.720 --> 11:28.754
I know!

11:29.088 --> 11:30.723
- You're quite the success.
- Oh!

11:31.123 --> 11:34.326
Your magazine is everywhere,
and you're not far behind.

11:34.627 --> 11:35.394
We are having
a bit of a moment.

11:35.594 --> 11:36.495
Yes.

11:36.796 --> 11:37.930
And I hear
you're writing a book.

11:38.297 --> 11:40.466
Yes, and I have been dying
to talk to you about it.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.101
So... okay.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.270
I'm actually thinking
of using my thesis

11:44.503 --> 11:45.905
as the jumping-off point.

11:46.272 --> 11:47.773
So that makes you
the perfect person to ask to--

11:48.007 --> 11:48.908
I can't wait to read it.

11:49.241 --> 11:50.609
You'll have
to sign a copy for me.

11:50.843 --> 11:51.744
And what about you?

11:52.078 --> 11:53.012
Did you stay out West
for school?

11:53.312 --> 11:55.214
Well, I, um...
I started at Berkeley.

11:55.614 --> 11:57.983
What? No, you married Lenny
right out of high school.

11:58.250 --> 12:01.420
No, I did a semester at Cal.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.724
Then Mom left and-and...

12:05.091 --> 12:07.460
somebody needed to come home
and-and help Dad.

12:07.860 --> 12:10.663
Certainly wasn't gonna raise
an eight-year-old on his own,

12:10.863 --> 12:11.897
so I dropped out.

12:12.198 --> 12:13.466
Sisters forced to navigate

12:13.799 --> 12:16.135
the gender revolution
without a mother.

12:16.435 --> 12:17.503
Now that's a book I would read.

12:17.703 --> 12:18.671
Oh.

12:18.971 --> 12:20.072
Not sure anyone cares
about... no.

12:20.439 --> 12:24.176
It's more, um,
ideas that I'm interested in.

12:24.443 --> 12:28.481
Sociopolitical commentary...

12:28.814 --> 12:30.349
Uh, you know,
Shelly is a writer, too.

12:30.616 --> 12:32.284
Oh, that makes sense.

12:32.618 --> 12:33.853
A natural raconteur.

12:34.053 --> 12:34.987
What's your genre?

12:35.287 --> 12:36.322
- Well, I--
- Oh, it's so fun.

12:36.655 --> 12:38.891
Her voice really reminds me
of Djuna Barnes.

12:39.191 --> 12:40.659
Do you remember Cora
from seminar,

12:40.993 --> 12:42.128
and she could never say
Djuna Barnes?

12:42.461 --> 12:44.196
She would always say D-Juna.
Remember?

12:44.630 --> 12:46.398
And then she drove down with us
to the city to see that play,

12:46.732 --> 12:48.701
the-the all-female Hamlet
in Central Park?

12:49.034 --> 12:51.871
I recall
seeing that production.

12:52.037 --> 12:52.838
Turgid.

12:53.038 --> 12:54.340
Well, you know,

12:54.740 --> 12:56.208
obviously, you're not gonna
remember every single student.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.478
You remember me, though.

12:59.712 --> 13:02.047
Yes! How could I forget

13:02.414 --> 13:06.118
your, uh, recontextualization
of Sor Juana de la Cruz?

13:06.418 --> 13:07.820
Yeah, that got thesis
of the year,

13:08.154 --> 13:10.389
but, um, my friend Maggie
wrote that.

13:10.656 --> 13:12.458
Uh, Joycie did the Brontes.

13:12.691 --> 13:14.593
Of course. I'm so sorry.

13:14.860 --> 13:16.829
Oh, it's fine.

13:17.196 --> 13:19.298
I obviously don't remember
all of my professors.

13:19.665 --> 13:22.001
Well, and now you brought
the Brontes to life.

13:22.334 --> 13:24.136
Two sisters,
two formidable writers.

13:24.403 --> 13:25.437
Well, mine are just scribbles.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.773
Don't diminish your talent
like that.

13:28.174 --> 13:31.577
The key is to stop worrying
about what other people hear

13:31.911 --> 13:35.514
and fall in love
with your own unique voice.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.550
There's nothing like it.

13:39.451 --> 13:41.187
Well, thank you.

13:43.689 --> 13:44.690
Are you all right, dear?

13:44.924 --> 13:47.459
Joyce. My name is Joyce.

13:48.794 --> 13:50.296
I need some air.

13:55.568 --> 13:56.669
Meatball?

13:56.869 --> 13:58.437
Oh, yeah.

13:58.737 --> 14:00.039
Mm!
Needs a little bit more sauce.

14:00.272 --> 14:01.140
I licked it off.

14:03.075 --> 14:05.411
So you sell magazines
about vaginas, huh?

14:05.611 --> 14:06.412
About vaginas?

14:06.712 --> 14:07.813
No, we're mostly in the, uh...

14:08.147 --> 14:09.381
in the... in the penis business
now, actually.

14:09.548 --> 14:10.850
Mm.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.118
So Benji, you've been with
this family longer than me.

14:13.452 --> 14:16.589
How do I get from this table
to that one?

14:16.822 --> 14:18.357
What's in it for me?

14:18.657 --> 14:19.391
Helping me out.
What do you mean?

14:19.625 --> 14:20.759
What do you want, cash?

14:20.993 --> 14:21.961
Minx subscription.

14:22.228 --> 14:23.729
Full year, plus back issues.

14:24.063 --> 14:25.231
You're too young.
How old are you, kid?

14:25.431 --> 14:26.265
13.

14:26.565 --> 14:28.000
- You are 13?
- Yeah.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.035
- You got a place to store it?
- Yeah.

14:30.336 --> 14:32.004
'Cause I used to keep mine,
you know,

14:32.338 --> 14:33.572
ladies underwear catalogue,
under a mattress.

14:33.839 --> 14:34.540
Where are you keeping yours?

14:34.740 --> 14:35.674
Amateur.

14:35.975 --> 14:37.243
That's the first place
they look.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.645
I got a spot under
the floorboard of the kitchen.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.780
There's still moonshine
in there.

14:41.981 --> 14:43.749
All right.

14:43.983 --> 14:44.783
All right, fuck it.

14:45.084 --> 14:47.486
You got a deal. Let's do this.

14:47.653 --> 14:48.754
Marvin.

14:50.689 --> 14:53.626
Grandma likes him best
'cause he needs her most.

14:53.959 --> 14:56.829
That is
really insightful stuff, man.

14:57.129 --> 14:58.731
Do you want my spaghetti?

14:58.964 --> 14:59.865
Oh, no thank you.

15:00.165 --> 15:00.933
Thank you, though,
for the offer.

15:01.133 --> 15:01.934
It's so funny.

15:02.167 --> 15:03.402
I can hear the colors.

15:03.669 --> 15:05.037
And this one's screaming.

15:05.337 --> 15:07.406
- More taupe, please.
- No.

15:07.673 --> 15:08.874
You're perfect.

15:13.145 --> 15:14.613
Josefina.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.348
How gorgeous are you?

15:18.050 --> 15:20.519
I can see it now.

15:20.819 --> 15:23.722
Why you have to leave
our family.

15:24.056 --> 15:26.292
You have so much more
to give this world.

15:26.558 --> 15:29.995
Not a family. Just a workplace.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.564
And you have more to give, too.

15:32.898 --> 15:37.202
You're-you're so good
at loving and nurturing.

15:40.039 --> 15:42.741
You have a real gift, Bambi.

15:43.142 --> 15:46.879
♪ Waiting for someone
To come on home ♪

15:54.586 --> 15:57.056
Drugs are amazing.

15:57.356 --> 16:00.125
What? What is it?

16:00.359 --> 16:02.061
We should do more.

16:02.227 --> 16:03.662
Yes.

16:05.931 --> 16:07.766
Benji said you like
a white Russian.

16:09.001 --> 16:10.069
Mind if I sit down?

16:12.504 --> 16:14.206
Well, thank you.

16:14.573 --> 16:17.576
I gotta ask you, Marvin,
why do you hate me so much?

16:18.010 --> 16:19.878
Why does everybody hate me?
Is it 'cause I was Tina's boss?

16:20.079 --> 16:21.847
Is that it?

16:22.114 --> 16:24.016
Nobody cares about that, man.

16:24.383 --> 16:26.585
How do you think my dad
got together with my mom?

16:26.785 --> 16:28.354
Then what is it?

16:28.687 --> 16:29.955
'Cause I'm really trying
to make this work.

16:30.356 --> 16:32.057
There's a chance you and I
are gonna be brothers one day.

16:32.391 --> 16:35.594
Mm, I don't see that happening
for us.

16:37.863 --> 16:39.798
The store was Tina's.

16:40.065 --> 16:41.934
That was always the plan.

16:42.267 --> 16:44.269
Then you come along
and hire her away.

16:44.536 --> 16:46.672
Dad dies, Mom steps in.

16:46.972 --> 16:49.908
Now it's my turn.
You did all that.

16:50.275 --> 16:51.643
Look, I've done a lot of
questionable things in my life,

16:51.944 --> 16:53.178
but offering a talented woman
a job

16:53.445 --> 16:54.413
I don't see as one of them.

16:54.646 --> 16:56.015
She loves her family.

16:56.315 --> 16:57.750
She would never have
just walked away.

16:57.983 --> 16:59.051
You hypnotized her.

16:59.385 --> 17:00.619
There was always a fire
within her.

17:00.986 --> 17:02.755
Maybe I fanned the flames
a little bit, but that's it.

17:02.988 --> 17:03.722
- Nah.
- Yeah.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.457
You talked her into it.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.292
Hey, what did you even say, anyway?

17:07.559 --> 17:08.927
I just told her the truth.

17:09.161 --> 17:10.696
Judy, you'd be fascinated

17:10.963 --> 17:12.598
by what Shelly's
been working on.

17:12.931 --> 17:14.767
Shelly,
how would you describe it?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.468
Oh, uh, I don't know.

17:16.735 --> 17:20.305
Um, I guess I'd say, uh...

17:20.572 --> 17:22.875
I take Madame Bovary, uh,

17:23.142 --> 17:25.444
a touch of the Marquis de Sade,

17:25.778 --> 17:27.946
mix in a little Donna Reed...

17:28.247 --> 17:29.581
...and then use it all
to explore

17:29.848 --> 17:32.184
America's suburban anxiety.

17:33.819 --> 17:34.920
Fuck, that sounds good.

17:35.187 --> 17:36.955
She's been publishing at Minx.

17:37.289 --> 17:38.791
I'm teaching a seminar
next semester

17:39.024 --> 17:40.492
on the modern erotic.

17:40.826 --> 17:42.594
This sounds exactly like
the type of thing

17:42.861 --> 17:44.296
I should include
on the syllabus.

17:44.463 --> 17:45.531
Oh.

17:48.634 --> 17:50.335
You remember Jared
from First Baptist?

17:50.636 --> 17:53.672
- Mm-hmm.
- He has four sons now.

17:53.939 --> 17:55.174
I bet he's a great dad.

17:55.541 --> 17:59.011
You could give him a call
since you love married men.

18:01.513 --> 18:02.614
Mm.

18:02.848 --> 18:05.250
Happy retirement!

18:05.451 --> 18:06.919
Mm.

18:07.119 --> 18:08.787
Okay.

18:14.993 --> 18:16.728
Oh, my goodness.

18:16.962 --> 18:17.996
It's the day that--

18:18.330 --> 18:20.365
Your daddy took over the store
from Grampy.

18:20.666 --> 18:23.268
- Yes.
- Oh, baby!

18:23.535 --> 18:25.871
Thank you!

18:26.171 --> 18:29.141
- I'm glad you like it.
- Thank you.

18:29.341 --> 18:30.976
Mm.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.045
Now listen, Mama.

18:33.245 --> 18:34.980
About Doug.

18:35.314 --> 18:36.181
Don't you think it's time
that we--

18:38.016 --> 18:39.051
Hey, let's bring it in, everybody.

18:39.384 --> 18:41.753
My lovely family, one second,
one second.

18:42.087 --> 18:43.288
I know
we're all gathered here today

18:43.555 --> 18:45.524
to celebrate Mama's retirement

18:45.891 --> 18:48.827
and the next generation
taking over Lewis Stationers.

18:51.196 --> 18:53.232
Hey, hey!

18:54.600 --> 18:59.171
Now, I had a nice conversation
with my brother, Doug Renetti.

18:59.371 --> 19:01.440
Smart man.

19:01.707 --> 19:02.674
Now, he convinced me that

19:03.008 --> 19:05.177
I gotta start living
my dreams,

19:05.544 --> 19:08.046
and that means becoming
a long-haul trucker...

19:10.115 --> 19:12.718
...and exploring the highways
and byways of this great land.

19:12.951 --> 19:13.752
Jesus Christ.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.654
To Doug!

Oh, God.

19:42.080 --> 19:42.948
Oh, God.

19:45.050 --> 19:46.084
Ah!

19:46.285 --> 19:47.286
Snake charmer!

19:47.586 --> 19:48.453
I didn't tell him to leave!

19:48.754 --> 19:50.088
I just told him
what I told Tina!

19:50.389 --> 19:51.657
- That's it!
- Confidence man!

19:51.924 --> 19:54.493
Mama, stop it!

19:55.661 --> 19:56.828
It's not Doug's fault

19:57.229 --> 19:59.364
nobody wants to work
at the damn stationery store.

19:59.598 --> 20:00.732
If he hadn't come along,

20:01.066 --> 20:02.634
I would've found another way
to escape.

20:02.968 --> 20:04.169
Hell, Ruby married
the first guy she met

20:04.469 --> 20:05.537
to get out of
running the store.

20:05.904 --> 20:06.738
- Hey, hey, hey. Hold up.
- Sorry, Dave.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.574
Love you.

20:08.941 --> 20:11.076
And Marvin,
since when are you into trucks?

20:11.343 --> 20:13.245
The road calls.
Always has.

20:13.512 --> 20:14.446
The road calls because you--

20:14.746 --> 20:15.814
Because you killed his father.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.617
Mama, you gotta stop that.

20:18.917 --> 20:20.619
You know
Daddy died of emphysema.

20:20.852 --> 20:22.487
After you left the store!

20:22.854 --> 20:24.990
If anything killed Daddy,
other than emphysema,

20:25.190 --> 20:26.091
it was the store,

20:26.425 --> 20:27.392
which he hated
more than any of us.

20:27.626 --> 20:28.594
Not more than me!

20:28.794 --> 20:29.928
Then sell it!

20:30.295 --> 20:32.431
Don't pass it along
like a haunted hot potato.

20:32.778 --> 20:36.401
I would never turn my back
on what this family built.

20:36.635 --> 20:38.971
I understand duty,

20:39.117 --> 20:40.138
unlike you,

20:40.472 --> 20:42.975
who threw it all away
to be secretary

20:43.275 --> 20:45.811
to a twice-divorced,
philandering

20:46.044 --> 20:48.280
white pornographer!

20:48.614 --> 20:50.449
Yeah.

20:50.816 --> 20:53.819
I haven't been a secretary
for more than a year.

20:54.152 --> 20:56.989
And as a matter of fact,
I was just promoted.

20:57.222 --> 20:58.257
I'm going to be running

20:58.557 --> 21:00.692
the entire Minx
international division.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.195
Eight editions,
four continents.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.063
And I get to move to Europe!

21:07.399 --> 21:09.201
So what exactly
did I throw away?

21:14.706 --> 21:15.574
What was that?

21:15.874 --> 21:17.109
What were you doing...
in there?

21:17.476 --> 21:19.311
And would you please put a sock
on the door?

21:19.578 --> 21:20.879
Okay, I'm sure that was a lot.

21:21.179 --> 21:22.948
Since when are you a...
you know...

21:23.181 --> 21:24.416
with Professor Merrim?

21:24.716 --> 21:26.852
Oh, God.
Just call her Doreen already.

21:27.185 --> 21:30.289
I don't want to, Shelly.
This is-this is a...

21:30.522 --> 21:31.790
What about Lenny?

21:32.137 --> 21:36.161
Well, Lenny and I have
a sophisticated relationship.

21:36.395 --> 21:37.863
We're, you know...

21:40.399 --> 21:42.000
Holy shit.
You're Bella LaRouche.

21:43.268 --> 21:45.070
Light dawns on Marblehead.

21:45.370 --> 21:48.206
This is just out of nowhere, Shel.

21:48.507 --> 21:50.142
I've been trying
to talk to you.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.244
This trip is
about my fellowship

21:52.577 --> 21:55.080
and asking Professor--
Doreen if she would...

21:55.447 --> 21:57.616
if she would write my prologue,
and now you've just...

21:58.016 --> 22:01.520
you've just twisted it
into your sexual exploration.

22:01.887 --> 22:04.856
Jesus, Joyce.
This isn't about you for once.

22:05.190 --> 22:06.124
- What does that mean?
- What?

22:06.425 --> 22:08.794
It-it means just that
I am sick of you

22:09.194 --> 22:12.230
paying zero attention to anyone
other than Joyce Prigger.

22:12.464 --> 22:13.465
I mean, for Chrissake,

22:13.799 --> 22:15.067
you didn't even remember
I went to college?

22:15.400 --> 22:18.170
Oh, come on.
Shel, I was eight years old.

22:18.403 --> 22:19.471
And I was, you know,

22:19.805 --> 22:21.173
a bit distracted
by the fact that Mom had left.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.641
What do you want from me?

22:23.041 --> 22:25.410
Well, for starters,
how about some gratitude, okay?

22:25.744 --> 22:28.080
I let go of my dreams
to take care of you.

22:28.413 --> 22:30.949
You've gotten to be
whoever you wanted.

22:31.216 --> 22:32.551
Why can't it be my turn?

22:32.884 --> 22:36.054
It can.
It can, Shel, it-it's just...

22:37.489 --> 22:39.825
Just why here? Why now?

22:40.158 --> 22:42.027
Joyce, I know you wanted
to come back here

22:42.327 --> 22:43.995
so the world could gather
at your feet

22:44.296 --> 22:45.464
and tell you
how brilliant you are,

22:45.797 --> 22:47.999
but I am sick
of putting my life on hold

22:48.233 --> 22:49.968
to talk about yours.

22:51.403 --> 22:52.504
Now, if you'll excuse me,

22:52.838 --> 22:54.406
I've been promised
the full Vassar experience,

22:54.740 --> 22:56.675
and I don't want
to keep her waiting.

22:59.010 --> 23:00.245
Okay.

23:00.445 --> 23:01.613
This is a sock.

23:01.980 --> 23:04.683
I'm putting it on the doorknob
just so we're clear.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.320
Did I just do that?

23:08.620 --> 23:09.588
I can't believe
I just did that.

23:09.821 --> 23:10.922
I slapped her finger!

23:11.656 --> 23:14.059
- Nobody stands up to my mom.
- You did.

23:14.426 --> 23:17.229
I'm so glad you were there
and you saw that!

23:17.429 --> 23:18.363
Yeah.

23:18.663 --> 23:19.331
It was a real
breakthrough moment.

23:19.598 --> 23:21.166
It was.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.602
Hey, why didn't you tell me
about Minx International, Tins?

23:23.835 --> 23:25.804
I'm a little confused.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.306
Well, it happened
while you were in Vegas.

23:28.673 --> 23:30.308
Constance made me promise
not to tell anybody, so...

23:30.609 --> 23:32.477
Well, I'm not anybody, right?

23:34.780 --> 23:36.114
I know it was your idea.

23:36.348 --> 23:37.349
So the fuck what?

23:37.616 --> 23:39.384
You've kinda had a bad run.

23:42.554 --> 23:45.023
Well, I'm happy for you.

23:45.290 --> 23:47.192
This is a big deal for you.

23:50.128 --> 23:51.463
But you didn't tell me
about business school.

23:51.797 --> 23:54.366
You didn't tell me about this. I...

23:54.699 --> 23:57.068
I guess I didn't know
how you'd take it.

24:01.473 --> 24:03.642
You're the first person
I wanna share my news with,

24:03.842 --> 24:06.211
good and bad.

24:06.478 --> 24:08.580
I want to be that for you.

24:10.348 --> 24:11.917
I want that, too.

24:29.234 --> 24:30.435
Apology scones.

24:32.884 --> 24:34.039
Thanks.

24:36.107 --> 24:37.275
I will be the first to admit

24:37.576 --> 24:40.378
that we both said things
we didn't mean.

24:40.612 --> 24:42.247
I meant every word.

24:44.783 --> 24:47.132
- Really?
- I regret yelling.

24:47.385 --> 24:50.355
Okay.

24:50.755 --> 24:53.225
Okay, well, we can talk more
about it in the car, I guess.

24:53.472 --> 24:55.160
Doreen invited me to breakfast.

24:55.460 --> 24:58.363
I-I've decided
to extend my stay.

24:58.563 --> 24:59.364
For how long?

24:59.598 --> 25:02.434
I-I... I don't know.

25:02.634 --> 25:04.236
What?

25:04.469 --> 25:05.604
Shel, what about the kids?

25:05.971 --> 25:08.707
Oh, Lenny's more than capable
of handling them.

25:09.020 --> 25:11.676
And hey, a flight alone?
You can work on your book.

25:13.144 --> 25:14.112
There's not much
to go on, really.

25:14.312 --> 25:15.947
It's just a title.

25:16.281 --> 25:17.382
Well, if you spend some time
with yourself

25:17.749 --> 25:19.284
rather than seeking out
other people's praise,

25:19.584 --> 25:21.319
maybe you'll know
where to start.

25:24.556 --> 25:26.591
