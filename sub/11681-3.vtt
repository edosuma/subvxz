Can't be too careful.

Don't say I didn't warn you.

Is that what brought you
down to Miami?

02:16.287 --> 02:19.022
Yeah. Yeah, I was looking at weapons

Found a connection
right here at the port.

that passed through Algeria.

02:24.429 --> 02:25.629
I made contact with a guy

02:25.697 --> 02:26.897
Shipping artillery
for one of the operations,

02:26.965 --> 02:28.399
Told him I wanted to move
some guns of my own.

02:28.466 --> 02:30.567
Did you get a name or a face?

02:30.635 --> 02:31.869
Only spoke on the phone.

02:31.936 --> 02:34.738
He had this, uh...
This trippy voice.

02:34.806 --> 02:37.207
It was, like,
sort of like a low hiss.

02:37.275 --> 02:38.509
It was weird,
so I called him cobra.

with him a couple weeks ago.

02:50.622 --> 02:51.789
He didn't show up.

02:51.856 --> 02:53.857
Now, I don't know if he
got cold feet or what,

But if we can find him, we can
crack this thing wide open.

Oh, is he gonna be comfortable
when you wire him up?

on these guys,

We can wrap it up in a nice
little bow for the cops.

How about

Yep, Tony caro.

What is it you do, again?

08:28.050 --> 08:30.185
Michael said, what,
government work?

08:30.253 --> 08:32.654
I used to, yeah.
Mm.

08:32.722 --> 08:34.556
Does that have anything to do
with why you always

08:34.624 --> 08:36.191
Leave the house
through a different door?

08:36.259 --> 08:39.895
Or you never park your car
in the same spot on the street?

08:39.962 --> 08:41.663
[ chuckles ]

08:41.731 --> 08:44.099
Superstitious, I guess.

08:44.166 --> 08:45.133
Mm-hmm.

08:48.537 --> 08:50.472
<i>I think he's here
to see me.</i>

08:50.539 --> 08:52.107
'course he is.

08:53.609 --> 08:55.377
Your mom is no joke.

08:55.444 --> 08:58.246
Could give most counterintel
agents a run for their money.

08:58.314 --> 08:59.881
<i>I'm surprised she hasn't
broken you yet.</i>

08:59.949 --> 09:01.283
Oh, trust me, I can handle it.

09:01.350 --> 09:03.051
What's the latest
on our mob problem?

09:03.119 --> 09:04.252
Well, they're careful.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.754
Best bet is to convince them

09:05.821 --> 09:07.656
That the feds are
on to their port operation,

09:07.723 --> 09:08.990
Get them to walk away.

09:09.058 --> 09:10.392
Okay.
How do we do that?

09:10.459 --> 09:11.860
<i>We aren't doing anything.</i>

09:11.928 --> 09:13.628
<i>Uh, yes, we are.
I want in on it.</i>

09:13.696 --> 09:15.330
They've seen your face, Jesse.

09:15.398 --> 09:17.632
I need to get ears on them.

09:17.700 --> 09:19.868
Okay, so you're gonna bug
a bunch of wiseguys?

09:19.936 --> 09:22.771
Good luck with that.
They'll be looking for it.

09:22.838 --> 09:24.372
<i>Trust me,
I can handle it.</i>

09:25.341 --> 09:28.310
<i>Ideally, a bug should
never be seen by anyone.</i>

09:28.377 --> 09:30.445
<i>But when there's
a possibility it may be,</i>

09:30.513 --> 09:32.013
<i>It's best to make it
look like something</i>

09:32.081 --> 09:33.715
<i>People won't want to touch.</i>

09:33.783 --> 09:36.217
<i>A wad of gum stuck
to a balled-up piece of tissue</i>

09:36.285 --> 09:38.520
<i>And a sprinkling of whatever's
in your lint trap</i>

09:38.587 --> 09:40.055
<i>Will usually do the trick.</i>

09:43.659 --> 09:45.560
Okay, that's disgusting.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.929
Thanks, Sam.

09:47.997 --> 09:49.397
What do you have?

09:49.465 --> 09:51.032
Proud of this one, Mikey.

09:51.100 --> 09:53.068
Figured we needed a guy

09:53.135 --> 09:56.338
Who had to appear willing to
sell information to a mobster,

09:56.405 --> 09:57.639
Right?

09:57.707 --> 09:59.674
So, went through a few files,

09:59.742 --> 10:02.110
And I found a guy
whose identity you could borrow

10:02.178 --> 10:03.745
And whose history
over the last six months

10:03.813 --> 10:05.880
You could make up and nobody
would know the difference.

10:05.948 --> 10:07.749
The suspense is
killing me, Sam.

10:07.817 --> 10:11.353
Ned Gordon,
recently suspended FBI agent.

10:11.420 --> 10:13.321
Real guy apparently
is on a drinking binge

10:13.389 --> 10:15.090
Somewhere
in the alaskan wilderness.

10:15.157 --> 10:18.326
Here you go.
What do you think?

10:18.394 --> 10:20.128
Not bad, Sam.

10:20.196 --> 10:23.198
Not bad? Short of being in the federal
computer system, you are all set.

10:23.265 --> 10:26.068
Now all you need is a cheap
sports coat and some ugly shoes.

10:26.436 --> 10:28.704
<i>Organized crime bosses,</i>

10:28.771 --> 10:30.739
<i>Like senior administrators
in any business,</i>

10:30.807 --> 10:32.608
<i>Have a lot of people
who want to meet with them.</i>

10:32.675 --> 10:35.276
<i>Hang around long enough
asking for some face time,</i>

10:35.544 --> 10:37.378
<i>And you can get yourself
on the schedule,</i>

10:37.446 --> 10:38.846
<i>But don't count
on the receptionist</i>

while you wait.</i>

10:40.282 --> 10:41.549
Tony: Listen,
you son of a bitch!

10:41.617 --> 10:42.884
I'm doing you a favor

10:42.952 --> 10:44.752
Letting you sell those TVs
in your store!

10:44.820 --> 10:46.054
Man: I'm sorry.
It's my son.

10:46.121 --> 10:47.589
I needed to buy some medicine.

10:47.656 --> 10:48.990
When am I gonna get my money?

10:49.058 --> 10:50.491
Today, in the afternoon,
I swear.

10:50.559 --> 10:52.227
Don't let this happen again,

10:52.294 --> 10:53.828
Or your kid's gonna have
other problems

10:53.896 --> 10:56.097
That no amount of medicine's
gonna fix, you understand me?

10:56.165 --> 10:59.867
Do you understand me?! Get him
out of here before I kill him.

You been standing in front
of my place for half a day.

11:11.146 --> 11:12.747
You got something you want to
talk to me about?

11:12.815 --> 11:15.717
Yeah. If I, uh -- if I had
some, uh, information

11:15.784 --> 11:19.087
About an ongoing
investigation into y--

11:19.154 --> 11:20.588

How much would that
be worth to you?

Investigation? I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:33.435 --> 11:36.371
Tell you what --
why don't we take it like this?

11:36.438 --> 11:39.407
You tell me who you are
and what you got,

11:39.475 --> 11:40.875
And I'll decide
what it's worth.

I think I found out how Tony
knew that you weren't FBI.

off the bug, earlier.

Oh, he's got a fed
in his pocket. Nice.

14:41.587 --> 14:43.754
That would explain how he avoided
getting busted all these years.

14:43.822 --> 14:45.189
So, why are we here, Sam?

14:45.257 --> 14:47.191
So you can tell us
Tony's untouchable?

14:47.259 --> 14:49.760
Have a little faith, Mike.
I think I found a new angle.

14:49.828 --> 14:51.529
Now, you see that guy in there
talking to Tony?

14:51.597 --> 14:53.531
That's Gio Russo.

15:22.394 --> 15:23.694
Tony's not gonna stop
squeezing him.

15:23.762 --> 15:25.496
Yeah, but it means
he might be desperate enough

15:25.564 --> 15:27.064
To make a stupid move.

15:27.132 --> 15:29.100
If we can get him to do
some dirty work himself,

We can get him busted
for something

His fed buddies
can't get him out of.

a little more time, okay?

we can talk about.

Yeah, about that...

you could use them.

17:10.202 --> 17:11.602
Uh, yeah, yeah.

17:11.670 --> 17:14.238
She actually passed away
when I was 9.

17:14.306 --> 17:16.641
Oh, I'm sorry.
What happened?

17:16.708 --> 17:19.542
Uh, she was killed

17:19.611 --> 17:22.012
During a robbery
at a convenience store.

17:22.079 --> 17:24.515
She was working
the graveyard shift.

17:24.583 --> 17:26.349
Uh, killer ran off
with less than 50 bucks,

17:26.417 --> 17:29.487
And she bled out on the floor.

17:29.554 --> 17:32.256
There was people watching
from the parking lot, too.

17:32.324 --> 17:34.125
Nobody did anything.

17:34.192 --> 17:38.829
So, uh, by the time the cops
got there, she was dead.

17:38.897 --> 17:41.932
Now you've hooked up
with Michael.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.668
Gonna try and save the world.

17:43.735 --> 17:44.869
[ chuckles ]

17:44.936 --> 17:46.704
Something like that, yeah.

17:46.772 --> 17:48.372
[ cellphone rings ]

17:48.440 --> 17:51.142
Yeah, Sam?

17:51.209 --> 17:53.344
Yeah, let me get changed.
I'll be right there.

18:06.892 --> 18:09.326
<i>Grabbing someone
who travels with protection</i>

18:09.394 --> 18:11.996
<i>Is about finding the moments
when they're least protected.</i>

18:17.636 --> 18:20.905
<i>Fortunately,
even the most paranoid gangster</i>

18:20.972 --> 18:23.007
<i>Insists on doing
some things alone.</i>

18:26.244 --> 18:28.679
<i>Executing a successful
close-quarters assault</i>

18:28.747 --> 18:30.614
<i>Is all about setting the stage.</i>

18:30.682 --> 18:33.818
<i>You'll want to dull
any reflective surfaces...</i>

18:33.885 --> 18:36.721
<i>Corral your target
into a corner...</i>

18:36.788 --> 18:40.624
<i>And hit him
when he's most vulnerable.</i>

18:42.861 --> 18:45.730
Easy. Easy, now.

18:45.797 --> 18:46.931
Mm!

18:46.998 --> 18:48.699
Night-night.

18:48.767 --> 18:51.368
<i>And it never hurts to have
a prearranged exit strategy.</i>

18:51.436 --> 18:53.037
You really think
you can scare this dude

18:53.105 --> 18:54.972
Into pulling something
that'll get him busted, huh?

18:55.040 --> 18:56.607
<i>Oh, I know I can.</i>

18:56.675 --> 18:59.777
Really? 'cause you don't
look that scary.

18:59.845 --> 19:01.846
You haven't seen Chuck Finley
in action.

19:04.216 --> 19:05.316
Sorry.
Coming through.

19:05.383 --> 19:07.118
Somebody can't handle
his liquor.

19:11.289 --> 19:13.057
Tony: You know who I'm with?
You know who I am?

19:13.125 --> 19:14.425
I'm a made guy.

19:14.493 --> 19:15.793
You touch me --

19:15.861 --> 19:18.028
[ laughs ] you're gonna
threaten me with the family?

19:18.096 --> 19:19.830
Who do you think
wants you dead?

19:19.898 --> 19:23.567
Look, you know as well as anyone
you haven't been earning.

19:23.635 --> 19:27.238
Is it gio?
Is gio behind this?

19:27.305 --> 19:28.973
You didn't hear it from me.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.508
[ sighs ]

19:30.575 --> 19:32.676
Wait a minute.
You don't want to do this.

19:32.744 --> 19:34.011
What do you want --
money?

19:34.079 --> 19:35.146
I got 20 grand.

19:35.213 --> 19:38.382
[ laughs ] 20 grand?
You're funny.

19:38.450 --> 19:40.584
Come on.

19:40.652 --> 19:42.353
If you wanted to kill me,
I'd be dead already.

19:42.420 --> 19:44.989
Nah.
I just like the company.

19:45.056 --> 19:46.657
Look, it's nothing personal,

19:46.725 --> 19:48.259
But I got a job to do here,

19:48.326 --> 19:50.361
Or it's my ass
swinging in the wind.

19:50.428 --> 19:51.996
It's just the way
of the wild, brother.

19:52.063 --> 19:53.497
You don't see the gazelle

19:53.565 --> 19:55.266
Bargaining with the lion,
do you?

19:55.333 --> 19:56.634
Listen to me.
Listen to me!

19:56.701 --> 19:58.235
Hey, hey, hey.

19:58.303 --> 20:00.371
You don't want to wake
the other guests, do you?

20:00.438 --> 20:01.972
Look, if you're gonna
keep bellyaching

20:02.040 --> 20:03.240
While I'm shining
Mr. Slicey,

20:03.308 --> 20:04.975
We're gonna have to go back
to Mr. Needle.

20:05.043 --> 20:07.044
Wait a minute.
Hold on a second!

20:07.112 --> 20:08.379
What's your name?

20:11.116 --> 20:12.516
Chuck.
Chuck.

20:12.584 --> 20:15.386
Let me talk to New York.
I'll clear it with them.

20:15.453 --> 20:18.756
No, you know New York only
listens in $50s and $100s.

20:18.824 --> 20:21.759
Now, look, you got a couple mil you can
kick upstairs, maybe they'll listen.

20:21.827 --> 20:23.594
But, seriously,
this is so much easier.

20:23.662 --> 20:25.362
Hey, hey, I can get it!
I can get the money!

20:25.430 --> 20:26.964
Yeah? How?

20:27.032 --> 20:29.800
You got some kind of score that
can pull down that kind of cash?

20:29.868 --> 20:32.336
I don't think so.
Hey, hey, at the docks.

20:32.404 --> 20:34.271
Yeah, they got a big shipment
coming in.

20:34.339 --> 20:35.840
Oh, it's huge.

20:35.907 --> 20:37.174
I mean,
I was just gonna skim it,

20:37.242 --> 20:38.542
But, you know,
we can hit the whole thing.

20:38.610 --> 20:40.311
$5 mil, easy.

20:43.582 --> 20:45.015
Hmm.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.585
So, you're just gonna
waltz in there

20:47.652 --> 20:51.322
And take $5 million
off the docks by yourself?

20:51.389 --> 20:53.357
Hey, I got guys in my crew.

20:53.425 --> 20:56.760
<i>No, gio has guys
in your crew.</i>

20:56.828 --> 20:59.096
All right, look,
I'm telling you, I can do this.

20:59.164 --> 21:00.931
Just give me 48 hours.

21:00.999 --> 21:03.067
I'll cut you in --
say, a mil.

21:03.134 --> 21:06.604
Now is not the time to write
checks that you can't cash.

21:06.671 --> 21:08.138
No! Oh! No, no, no!

21:08.206 --> 21:11.442
I'll get you the money!
I swear!

21:13.812 --> 21:15.312
All right.

21:15.380 --> 21:17.681
Fine.

21:17.749 --> 21:20.484
48 hours...

21:20.552 --> 21:22.686
$1 mil.

21:22.754 --> 21:24.889
'cause I like you.

21:26.391 --> 21:28.125
All right, run along now.

21:28.193 --> 21:30.461
But don't be a stranger,
you understand.

21:30.528 --> 21:32.196
'cause if I have to
find you again,

21:32.264 --> 21:33.797
I'm not gonna be so friendly.

21:37.135 --> 21:39.336
And neither will
Mr. Slicey.

21:43.308 --> 21:44.642
Jesse:
So, check this out.

21:44.709 --> 21:46.577
I cross-referenced the documents
we got at the docks,

21:46.645 --> 21:48.445
Figured out which shipment
belonged to our boy cobra.

21:48.513 --> 21:50.114
Cobra -- that name...
Live with it.

21:50.181 --> 21:51.849
Anyway, the, uh, weapons

21:51.917 --> 21:54.118
Went from algerian ships
in the port...

21:54.185 --> 21:55.753
Onto the trucks.

21:55.820 --> 21:57.821
And they show up again
at the Opa-Locka airport.

21:57.889 --> 21:59.523
Any idea where they're headed?

21:59.591 --> 22:01.258
There's no way of telling.
The manifests were all forged.

22:01.326 --> 22:03.160
I'm trying to figure out which
hangar they went to, though.

22:03.228 --> 22:06.463
<i>[ cellphone rings ] my guess is that
cobra is working out of there.</i>

22:06.531 --> 22:08.499
Yeah, Sam?
How'd it go with Tony?

22:08.566 --> 22:10.868
Yeah, Mike, I got good news
and bad news.

22:10.936 --> 22:13.270
Good news is, Tony's gonna hit
the docks -- something big.

22:13.338 --> 22:14.371
Bad news?

22:14.439 --> 22:15.673
Well, he's back at his place,

22:15.740 --> 22:17.308
Making calls to his crew
to pull off the score.

22:17.375 --> 22:19.276
I tried to convince him
that he couldn't trust them,

22:19.344 --> 22:20.744
But I guess he's sentimental.

22:20.812 --> 22:22.980
Well, we'll just have to
cure him of that, won't we?

22:23.048 --> 22:25.716
Right there with you, Mikey.
Already called Fi.

22:25.784 --> 22:28.819
<i>Convincing a general that
he can't trust his soldiers</i>

22:28.887 --> 22:31.188
<i>Is an ancient
and time-honored strategy.</i>

22:31.256 --> 22:34.892
<i>In ancient Rome,
staging a botched assassination</i>

22:34.960 --> 22:37.761
<i>Usually involved
poisoning a few slaves.</i>

22:37.829 --> 22:40.097
<i>Today, the same effect
can be achieved</i>

22:40.165 --> 22:42.700
<i>With a cheap cellphone
and a brick of explosive.</i>

22:42.767 --> 22:44.368
[ beeping ]

23:02.320 --> 23:03.988
[ beeps ]

23:12.197 --> 23:14.131
[ breathing heavily ]

23:19.671 --> 23:21.605
Hey, there.

23:21.673 --> 23:25.042
Got your message.
What's up?

23:25.110 --> 23:28.645
You know how, uh, you said
my guys couldn't be trusted?

23:28.713 --> 23:30.147
Indeed I do.

23:30.215 --> 23:32.249
Well, you were right.
They just tried to take me out.

23:32.317 --> 23:33.684
Well, then,
we have a problem, don't we?

23:33.752 --> 23:36.220
'cause I seem to recall I was
promised a million dollars.

23:36.287 --> 23:37.755
I can get the money, all right.

23:37.822 --> 23:38.622
Yeah?
Yeah.

23:38.690 --> 23:39.857
How?

23:39.924 --> 23:42.626
You and me, together.
We can do this.

23:42.694 --> 23:44.194
Listen, it'll be a great score.

23:44.262 --> 23:45.596
You put the guys
together --

23:45.663 --> 23:46.997
Look, if I put together
the crew,

23:47.065 --> 23:48.665
My cut's gonna be
a lot bigger than a mil.

23:48.733 --> 23:50.034
Fine, $2 million.

23:50.101 --> 23:51.969
That's more like it.

23:52.037 --> 23:53.537
All right, tell you what.

23:53.605 --> 23:55.539
You come up with a plan,
I'll make some calls,

23:55.607 --> 23:57.541
Put together some manpower.

23:57.609 --> 23:59.410
All right.
I'll be in touch.

23:59.477 --> 24:01.912
Hey, Tony.

24:01.980 --> 24:03.914
I'm really glad I didn't
cut you into little pieces.

24:06.151 --> 24:07.251
Don't make me regret
my decision, huh?

24:17.262 --> 24:19.229
Yeah, Mike.
It's me.

24:19.297 --> 24:22.032
Looks like
I'm Tony's new partner.

24:24.822 --> 24:27.758
Hank, it's not
that complicated.

24:27.825 --> 24:29.359
Tony's gonna try
to rob the docks.

24:29.427 --> 24:31.595
We're gonna make sure
he gets caught doing it.

24:31.663 --> 24:33.730
He gets busted,
his operation rolls up,

24:33.798 --> 24:35.299
And your problem goes away.

24:35.366 --> 24:37.501
Wait, but you're gonna
actually help him do this?

24:37.568 --> 24:39.369
Nothing's gonna get stolen.

24:39.437 --> 24:40.771
We just have to make sure

24:40.838 --> 24:42.506
That the mouse
goes after the cheese.

24:42.573 --> 24:43.740
And when he does...

24:47.211 --> 24:48.779
Shouldn't we talk
to the police?

24:48.846 --> 24:50.647
Look, Hank, we're not
supposed to tell you this.

24:50.715 --> 24:52.149
Tony's got an FBI agent
in his pocket.

24:52.216 --> 24:54.084
He'd just get tipped off.
This is how it has to be.

24:54.152 --> 24:56.720
All right.
What do I have to do?

24:56.788 --> 24:59.323
Well, that's the good part,
Hank. You get to be the hero.

24:59.390 --> 25:01.391
You get to be the one
who stops the heist.

25:01.459 --> 25:03.427
Sam's gonna be meeting
with Tony later.

25:03.494 --> 25:05.395
You just go to work.
Everything will be fine.

25:07.398 --> 25:08.999
Yeah, okay.
I'll see you guys later.

25:11.002 --> 25:12.202
[ sighs ]

25:12.270 --> 25:13.737
Sam's gonna need some backup.

25:13.805 --> 25:15.005
I'm there.

25:15.073 --> 25:17.674
Fi, you know as well as I do

25:17.742 --> 25:20.177
That Tony's going to be
expecting Sam's right-hand man

25:20.244 --> 25:22.179
To be...

25:22.246 --> 25:24.715
Well...A man.

25:26.484 --> 25:28.218
Looks like I'm coming
off the bench, then.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.728
Now, the shipment's
coming in there.

25:37.795 --> 25:39.062
Usually, we'd just hit
a few crates,

25:39.130 --> 25:40.330
But if we take
this whole thing,

25:40.398 --> 25:41.531
It's gonna be
a hell of a score.

25:41.599 --> 25:43.800
What's in the crates?
Microprocessors.

25:43.868 --> 25:46.136
You know, the stuff
they put in computers?

25:46.204 --> 25:49.706
50,000 units.
Street value -- $5 million.

25:49.774 --> 25:51.708
Guess that would explain
the security --

25:51.776 --> 25:54.044
The electric fence, gate...

25:54.112 --> 25:55.145
Rent-a-cops.

25:55.213 --> 25:56.580
The shipment's gonna be

25:56.647 --> 25:58.682
In a box truck
inside that warehouse.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.584
You guys can get in there, you're
gonna be able to drive right out.

26:00.651 --> 26:02.652
I'll take care of the
sales, any -- hold on.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.321
<i>We're going in there?</i>

26:04.389 --> 26:06.723
Yeah. Unh-unh.
You're coming with us.

26:06.791 --> 26:09.493
Uh -- no, no, no, no,
you don't understand.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.161
I don't do that stuff anymore.

26:11.229 --> 26:13.497
You see, I've paid my dues.
I'm a boss.

26:13.564 --> 26:15.932
Well, my friend, you will not
be a boss for much longer

26:16.000 --> 26:17.467
Unless you plan
on coming with us.

26:17.535 --> 26:19.336
I'm not doing it.

26:19.404 --> 26:21.171
Look, Tony, you're on a team with
Chuck, he takes care of you.

26:21.239 --> 26:22.639
I'm not gonna do it.
He takes care --

26:22.707 --> 26:24.107
Tell him about the time

26:24.175 --> 26:25.642
You, uh, saved your
navy seal buddy in El Salvador.

26:27.678 --> 26:29.646
Come on, tell him, man.

26:34.252 --> 26:35.585
[ clears throat ]

26:35.653 --> 26:37.087
It was the '80s.
Uh...

26:37.155 --> 26:40.590
I led a fact-finding team
into the country.

26:40.658 --> 26:43.427
There were five of us,
including my buddy Pete.

26:43.494 --> 26:46.630
'course, the, uh, death squads
were none too happy to see us,

26:46.697 --> 26:50.133
So we came under fire,
and Pete took one in the spine.

26:50.201 --> 26:53.236
He wanted me to dump him,
leave him behind.

26:53.304 --> 26:55.972
I sent the team ahead,
and Pete and I hole up

26:56.040 --> 26:58.008
In some church
for a couple days,

26:58.075 --> 27:00.577
Living off of communion wafers.

27:00.645 --> 27:05.048
Finally, a couple black hawks
airlifted us out of there.

27:05.116 --> 27:07.184
The point is,
no man left behind.

27:07.251 --> 27:12.322
That's the promise I make,
the promise I keep.

27:16.461 --> 27:18.061
That's a hell
of a story, Chuck.

27:19.497 --> 27:22.499
So, what do you say?
You in?

27:27.338 --> 27:29.473
Yeah, I'm in.
Let's do this.

27:33.044 --> 27:35.579
What the hell was that?

27:35.646 --> 27:37.013
What? The story?
Michael mentioned it.

27:37.081 --> 27:39.015
No, it's not just a story.

27:39.083 --> 27:41.451
<i>This is me.
It's my real life.</i>

27:41.519 --> 27:43.854
I don't pimp my past
to bad guys, you understand?

27:45.823 --> 27:47.324
It worked, didn't it?

27:53.631 --> 27:56.066
Bingo. Bingo.

27:56.133 --> 27:58.902
[ dialing ]

27:58.970 --> 28:00.937
Hey, Michael? It's Jesse.
I need to talk to you, man.

28:01.005 --> 28:03.039
Yeah, I heard about
what happened with Sam.

28:03.107 --> 28:06.076
Word to the wise -- stay out
of his war stories from now on.

28:06.143 --> 28:08.044
Come on, man,
the guy's an ex-navy seal.

28:08.112 --> 28:09.246
He's probably told that story
a million times.

28:09.313 --> 28:10.347
That's not the point, Jesse.

28:10.414 --> 28:11.481
You know, okay.
Point taken.

28:11.549 --> 28:13.049
Point taken.
That's not why I called.

28:13.117 --> 28:14.985
Listen, I think I found cobra's
warehouse at the airport.

28:15.052 --> 28:16.620
Well, I think
we should get over there.

28:16.687 --> 28:18.321
Yeah, I think we should.
I'm gonna come pick you up.

28:18.389 --> 28:19.556
All right.

28:19.624 --> 28:22.459
Fresh-baked
chocolate chips.

28:22.527 --> 28:24.728
Hey.

28:24.795 --> 28:27.731
What? Word got out
about my cookies, huh?

28:27.798 --> 28:29.399
Oh, good.

28:29.467 --> 28:31.101
You heading out somewhere?

28:31.168 --> 28:32.502
Yeah, I'm gonna
go meet Michael.

28:32.570 --> 28:34.371
That doesn't
narrow it down much.

28:36.707 --> 28:38.675
You're not gonna stop, are you?
What?

28:38.743 --> 28:40.877
You're just gonna keep on pushing
till you find out who I am.

28:40.945 --> 28:42.546
So you know what? I'm gonna save
us both some time, all right?

28:42.613 --> 28:44.514
I was
a counterintelligence agent

28:44.582 --> 28:47.183
Up until about a month ago,
when I was...

28:47.251 --> 28:48.418
Fired.

28:48.486 --> 28:49.986
Uh, somebody used
my security access

28:50.054 --> 28:51.388
To steal some classified files.

28:51.455 --> 28:52.889
Lucky for me,
your son was there to help me.

28:52.957 --> 28:54.658
Was he?

28:54.725 --> 28:56.426
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he saved my life.

28:56.494 --> 28:59.529
You raised a good man.

28:59.597 --> 29:01.431
You should know that.

29:01.499 --> 29:03.266
I'll see you later, all right?

29:21.552 --> 29:24.788
<i>Well, if it is cobra's hangar,
he's not here now.</i>

29:24.855 --> 29:26.923
I wish he was,
just so we could ask him

29:26.991 --> 29:29.492
<i>What he thinks
of the code name "cobra."</i>

29:29.560 --> 29:31.061
It's the same tail number

29:31.128 --> 29:33.463
As the plane he used
to move his weapons.

29:33.531 --> 29:35.599
What do you think?
We could wait for him.

29:35.666 --> 29:37.601
Just no telling
when he'd show up.

29:42.073 --> 29:45.875
<i>One reason it's tough
to pull off the perfect crime</i>

29:45.943 --> 29:49.245
<i>Is destroying evidence
leaves its own evidence.</i>

29:49.313 --> 29:50.914
<i>If a section of floor</i>

29:50.982 --> 29:53.350
<i>Has been cleaned
with a powerful surfactant,</i>

29:53.417 --> 29:55.852
<i>It sticks out like a drop
of bleach on a shirt,</i>

29:55.920 --> 29:57.420
<i>Begging the question,</i>

29:57.488 --> 30:00.824
<i>What did someone go
to so much trouble to clean?</i>

30:02.793 --> 30:05.061
What is that, grease?

30:05.129 --> 30:07.597
Blood. Looks like somebody
was dumping a body.

30:07.665 --> 30:09.799
Think it was cobra? That would
explain why he disappeared.

30:09.867 --> 30:11.801
<i>Well, if it was him,
he'll be tough to find.</i>

30:11.869 --> 30:13.236
Dump a body this way,

30:13.304 --> 30:16.039
It just drops out of the sky
when the landing gear deploys.

30:16.107 --> 30:18.375
Guess we're gonna have to track
down the last place this baby flew.

30:19.744 --> 30:21.144
Yeah, we're all set, Tony.

30:21.212 --> 30:23.046
The team's ready.

30:23.114 --> 30:25.715
Oh, you're excited?
Uh-huh.

30:25.783 --> 30:30.053
W-well, it's not exactly like
the mission in El Salvador.

30:30.121 --> 30:32.589
I-I guess
they're similar.

30:32.657 --> 30:34.457
Yeah, okay, I'll see you there.

30:34.525 --> 30:36.159
Ugh. The guy
will not stop calling me.

30:36.227 --> 30:38.328
He thinks he's part
of a frickin' platoon now.

30:38.396 --> 30:39.863
Aww, he likes you, Sam.

30:39.930 --> 30:41.364
Yeah, I don't need
friends like that,

30:41.432 --> 30:43.133
'cause when this is over,
he wants me to kill

30:43.200 --> 30:44.467
His whole crew,
families included.

30:44.535 --> 30:46.069
The guy's a piece of work.

30:46.137 --> 30:47.871
What's up, Hank?

30:47.938 --> 30:49.906
He's gonna see me.

30:49.974 --> 30:52.409
Look, by the time he sees you,
he's gonna be halfway to prison.

30:52.476 --> 30:54.077
So just stick
with the plan, Hank.

30:54.145 --> 30:55.712
It'll be fine.

31:03.087 --> 31:05.121
This it?
This the whole team?

31:05.189 --> 31:06.456
I got a few others around.

31:06.524 --> 31:08.158
What about on the road,
looking out for cops?

31:08.225 --> 31:09.292
Yeah.
Around the perimeter, too.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.694
Don't worry.
I got it covered.

31:10.761 --> 31:12.095
All right,
we're on the clock here.

31:12.163 --> 31:13.596
Three minutes from the time
we breach the fence

31:13.664 --> 31:15.098
To the time we drive out.

31:15.166 --> 31:16.399
Anything goes wrong,
we scatter and regroup.

31:16.467 --> 31:17.567
Roger that.

31:19.336 --> 31:20.970
Road team, set?

31:21.038 --> 31:22.405
Set.

31:22.473 --> 31:23.873
Perimeter team, set?

31:23.941 --> 31:24.908
[ gruffly ] set.

31:24.975 --> 31:26.643
Sniper team, set?

31:26.711 --> 31:27.711
[ Southern accent ] set.

31:27.778 --> 31:29.612
I got eyes on security,

31:29.680 --> 31:30.980
South side of the building.

31:31.048 --> 31:32.215
Take the shot --
give them a flat tire

31:32.283 --> 31:33.416
As they come around the corner.

31:33.484 --> 31:34.751
Roger that.

31:38.756 --> 31:41.191
Security car disabled.
Copy that.

31:41.258 --> 31:43.426
Okay.
We're good to go.

31:43.494 --> 31:45.428
<i>If you're cutting through
a high-powered electric fence,</i>

31:45.496 --> 31:46.963
<i>You need more
than rubber gloves</i>

31:47.031 --> 31:49.733
<i>And a pair
of thick-soled shoes.</i>

31:49.800 --> 31:52.068
<i>Covering a fence
with spray-on insulation</i>

31:52.136 --> 31:55.138
<i>And using a set of
fiberglass-handled bolt cutters</i>

31:55.206 --> 31:57.240
<i>Will keep you from lighting up
like a Christmas tree.</i>

32:02.913 --> 32:05.448
Hold on there, Chuck.
All right, you're clear.

32:08.285 --> 32:10.920
<i>A shape charge large enough
to go through a wall</i>

32:10.988 --> 32:13.823
<i>Is also large enough to let
everyone for several miles</i>

32:13.891 --> 32:15.759
<i>Know what you're doing.</i>

32:15.826 --> 32:18.695
<i>A smaller charge
can be just as useful</i>

32:18.763 --> 32:20.330
<i>And a lot less noisy.</i>

32:20.397 --> 32:23.333
<i>A hydraulic spreader
puts out enough pressure</i>

32:23.400 --> 32:25.068
<i>To rip a door off a humvee.</i>

32:25.136 --> 32:27.837
<i>Placed correctly,
it will make short work</i>

32:27.905 --> 32:30.006
<i>Of reinforced concrete.</i>

32:37.848 --> 32:40.183
$5 million!
It's a beautiful thing.

32:40.251 --> 32:41.785
We can admire it later.

32:41.852 --> 32:43.052
Get it started.
Let's get out of here.

32:47.091 --> 32:48.892

We got two minutes!

32:48.959 --> 32:50.960
[ engine turns over ]

32:52.897 --> 32:54.264
All right, I'll get the guard
to open the gate.

32:54.331 --> 32:55.632
You meet me on the other side.
You got it?

32:55.699 --> 32:57.467
I'll be there.

33:06.143 --> 33:08.011
Okay, Hank. This is it.
Open the gate.

33:08.078 --> 33:09.612
You sure about this?

33:09.680 --> 33:11.347
Look, we've already called in
the stolen truck.

33:11.415 --> 33:12.749
Every cop in Miami
is gonna be waiting for him

33:12.817 --> 33:14.184
About a mile from the port.

33:14.251 --> 33:16.553
But he's not gonna be there
unless you open the gate now.

33:17.354 --> 33:19.022
Good.

33:19.089 --> 33:20.623
Take my gun and lead me out.

33:20.691 --> 33:22.025
You sell this, we're home free.

33:24.195 --> 33:26.029
Just point the end
with the hole at me,

33:26.096 --> 33:28.064
And, uh,
try not to shake too much.

33:32.369 --> 33:35.638
Go!
Get out of here!

33:42.413 --> 33:43.746
Is it over?

33:43.814 --> 33:45.882
Sam:
Yeah, will be soon.

33:45.950 --> 33:47.083
Cops should be
closing in shortly.

33:47.151 --> 33:48.852

33:48.919 --> 33:51.020
Jesse and Fi clear?
[ normal voice ] all clear.

33:51.088 --> 33:52.422
You got a visual on Tony?

33:52.489 --> 33:54.190
Looking good, Sam.

33:56.060 --> 33:59.829
He stopped, Sam.
Something's wrong.

33:59.897 --> 34:01.598
What do you mean, he stopped?

34:01.665 --> 34:04.767
<i>A spy's job is to get into
the heads of his adversary,</i>

34:04.835 --> 34:07.604
<i>To know how he'll behave
and use it against him.</i>

34:07.671 --> 34:10.572
<i>But human behavior's about
as predictable as the weather.</i>

34:10.641 --> 34:12.442
<i>Sometimes
the most hardened criminal</i>

34:12.509 --> 34:15.911
<i>Can decide to be Noble
at the most inconvenient time.</i>

34:15.980 --> 34:18.114
Looks like Tony

34:18.181 --> 34:20.183
Had second thoughts
about leaving you behind.

34:20.251 --> 34:23.719
What?!
He's coming back, Sam.

34:23.786 --> 34:26.222
Okay, Hank,
I got to hit you in a second.

34:26.290 --> 34:27.924
And when I do, you run like hell
and don't look back.

34:27.992 --> 34:29.158
[ tires screech ]

[ siren wailing in distance ]

34:41.338 --> 34:43.239
What the hell happened?

34:43.306 --> 34:44.574
Leave no man behind, right?

34:44.641 --> 34:45.842
You didn't leave your buddy
in El Salvador,

34:45.909 --> 34:47.243
And I'm not leaving you.

34:47.311 --> 34:49.112
The truck is trashed.
We got to get out of here.

34:49.179 --> 34:50.780
Come on, let's go!

34:54.150 --> 34:56.152
[ panting ] hang on.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.187
I don't hear the sirens
anymore.

34:58.255 --> 35:00.223
I think we can stop running.

35:00.290 --> 35:02.158
What happened back there? My gun jammed.
The guy got the drop on me.

35:02.226 --> 35:03.526
What the hell are we gonna do?

35:03.594 --> 35:04.861
I don't know what to tell you.

35:04.928 --> 35:06.963
You got a big problem here,
Tony.

35:07.031 --> 35:09.298
Look, maybe you should just run.
Just get the hell out of town.

35:09.366 --> 35:11.000
No, no, no, no.
I'm not gonna lam it.

35:11.068 --> 35:13.169
You've got New York after you.

35:13.237 --> 35:15.872
Look, we caught
a bad break today.

35:15.939 --> 35:18.441
But you and me,
we make a great team.

35:18.509 --> 35:20.443
You got a good crew.

35:20.511 --> 35:22.812
Come on, we can do something
here, make a move.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.180
What are you trying
to say, Tony?

35:24.248 --> 35:26.749
You and me, we take out gio.

35:26.817 --> 35:28.985
I take over,
show New York who's boss.

35:29.053 --> 35:30.219
Wait a second.

35:30.287 --> 35:32.121
You're trying to get me
to help you kill gio?

35:32.189 --> 35:34.257
I'm telling you, this'll work.

35:34.324 --> 35:35.892
We take him out,
his guys, everyone.

35:35.959 --> 35:37.727
Hey, how many bodies
you gonna drop here?

35:37.795 --> 35:39.662
As much as it takes!
Tried to kill me!

35:39.730 --> 35:41.564
I'm telling you, this'll work.

35:41.632 --> 35:43.933
We hit 'em hard,
leave no one alive.

35:44.001 --> 35:46.669
Come on. Listen.

35:46.737 --> 35:49.305
Gio and his crew go
to the track every Friday.

35:49.373 --> 35:50.673
We can hit him then.

35:50.741 --> 35:52.942
All we need is cars,
muscle, and guns.

35:53.010 --> 35:55.078
Come on, are we in?
Huh?

35:55.145 --> 35:56.679
You're in.
Let's go!

35:59.917 --> 36:02.518
Okay, I am now officially
the closest friend

36:02.586 --> 36:04.954
Of a total psychopath.

36:05.022 --> 36:07.523
This is great.
This is just great.

36:07.591 --> 36:08.958
<i>I don't even want this.</i>

36:09.860 --> 36:12.095
So what did you say?

36:12.162 --> 36:14.097
<i>Well, what could I say? I told
him I would think about it.</i>

36:14.164 --> 36:15.832
I mean, what the hell
we gonna do now?

36:15.899 --> 36:17.934
He wants to go after Gio's crew
and start a war,

36:18.001 --> 36:19.302
All because his best buddy,
Chuck,

36:19.369 --> 36:21.504
Was such a stand-up guy
back in El Salvador.

36:21.572 --> 36:22.638
All right, so let's
let him start a war.

36:24.708 --> 36:27.210
We wanted Tony to stick
his neck out, right?

36:27.277 --> 36:29.579
It's just as easy to get him
busted for going after gio

36:29.646 --> 36:31.781
As it is to get him busted
for ripping off some warehouse.

36:31.849 --> 36:34.584
Tell me he's joking.
We don't have a lot of other choices, Sam.

36:34.651 --> 36:36.085
I'm not saying I love the idea,

36:36.153 --> 36:38.788
But it could help Hank get out
from under Tony's thumb.

36:38.856 --> 36:40.723
I kind of like it, actually.

36:40.791 --> 36:44.327
Taking out half of Miami's
wiseguys in one afternoon?

36:44.394 --> 36:45.628
We haven't done that before.

36:45.696 --> 36:47.463
Look, I hate to be
the naysayer here,

36:47.531 --> 36:49.098
But Tony is expecting an army,

36:49.166 --> 36:51.200
<i>And last time I checked,
we don't have an army.</i>

36:51.268 --> 36:53.069
Ohh.

36:53.137 --> 36:55.538
Oh, we'll give him an army.

36:55.606 --> 36:57.573
<i>Creating the illusion of force</i>

36:57.641 --> 36:59.575
<i>Is one of the oldest tricks
in warfare.</i>

36:59.643 --> 37:01.444
<i>The rise
of the private security guard</i>

37:01.512 --> 37:02.945
<i>Has made it a lot easier.</i>

37:03.013 --> 37:05.248
<i>Post a job opening
on the Internet in the morning,</i>

37:05.315 --> 37:06.883
<i>And by lunch,
you can have a whole platoon</i>

37:06.950 --> 37:08.584
<i>Of muscular guys
in black blazers.</i>

37:08.652 --> 37:10.219
17-inch arms?

37:10.287 --> 37:12.855
Huh.

37:12.923 --> 37:14.524
Lose the jacket.
Let me see 'em.

37:17.027 --> 37:18.594
Hmm.

37:18.662 --> 37:20.563
You've got a job.

37:20.631 --> 37:22.231
<i>Hire some heavy duty s.U.V.S</i>

37:22.299 --> 37:23.833
<i>To put your "security force"
in place...</i>

37:23.901 --> 37:25.234
Next!

37:25.302 --> 37:26.702
<i>...And it'll look just like</i>

37:26.770 --> 37:28.204
<i>You've got troops
ready for battle.</i>

37:28.272 --> 37:30.273
All right, you guys are gonna
follow the lead car

37:30.340 --> 37:31.807
To this spot, okay?

37:31.875 --> 37:34.343
Single-file line.
Keep it tight. Let's go.

37:39.516 --> 37:42.852
You ready to do this? Yes, I am.
You won't regret this.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.654
Once I'm the boss,
I'm gonna need some guys --

37:44.721 --> 37:46.222
<i>Good guys.</i>

37:46.290 --> 37:48.057
I won't forget what you did for me.
I'm sure you won't.

37:48.125 --> 37:49.692
Now, look,
as soon as we see gio,

37:49.760 --> 37:51.794
My snipers are gonna put a few
slugs through his engine block.

37:51.862 --> 37:54.263
We drive up,
you pop out with that bad boy.

37:54.331 --> 37:56.399
You let gio know
who's running the show here.

37:56.466 --> 37:58.201
My snipers
have got you covered,

37:58.268 --> 37:59.435
And I'm behind you all the way.

37:59.503 --> 38:01.170
All right, let's do this.

38:01.238 --> 38:04.273
You're the boss.
Will be soon, anyway. [ laughs ]

38:04.341 --> 38:07.109
We've got eyes on gio.

38:07.177 --> 38:08.411
[ beeps ]

38:08.478 --> 38:10.313
Okay, let's light him up.

38:10.380 --> 38:13.049
<i>Military leaders since
the city-states of early greece</i>

38:13.116 --> 38:14.817
<i>Have known that a tried
and tested method</i>

38:14.885 --> 38:16.419
<i>For getting rid of an adversary</i>

38:16.486 --> 38:20.122
<i>Is to provoke him to attack
a more powerful enemy.</i>

38:20.190 --> 38:21.591
Provide an ambitious adversary

38:21.658 --> 38:23.526
<i>With the backing
of a seemingly invincible army,</i>

38:23.594 --> 38:27.196
<i>And he's bound to go hunting
for even his toughest rival.</i>

38:34.938 --> 38:37.740
Get out, you son of a bitch,

38:37.808 --> 38:40.376
And face me like a man!

38:47.084 --> 38:49.819
Tony, what the hell
are you doing?

38:49.886 --> 38:51.854
You think you can take me out

38:51.922 --> 38:53.256
'cause I was
a few dollars short?

38:53.323 --> 38:55.358
What the hell
are you talking about?

38:55.425 --> 38:56.792
Okay, let's move.

38:56.860 --> 38:58.160
Tony: I'll tell you
what I'm talking about.

38:58.228 --> 39:00.396
I'm mixing things up right now.

39:00.464 --> 39:04.700
I got a new crew, and I got
a new way of doing things.

39:04.768 --> 39:08.437
And this town's
got a new boss -- me.

39:09.606 --> 39:13.175
Chuck...Get up here!

39:13.243 --> 39:15.211
<i>Making sure your adversary
is eliminated...</i>

39:15.279 --> 39:17.513
Chuck, what are you doing?!

39:17.581 --> 39:19.749
<i>...Then becomes
about pulling that backing</i>

39:19.816 --> 39:22.785
<i>Once he's declared war
on his rival...</i>

39:25.389 --> 39:26.956
Chuck!

39:27.024 --> 39:31.027
<i>...When it's too late for him
to take it all back.</i>

39:31.094 --> 39:34.397
You just made
a very big mistake, Tony.

39:40.637 --> 39:42.571
You mother...

39:42.639 --> 39:44.106
[ gunfire ]

39:46.943 --> 39:48.811
Sam: 10 arrests so far
on the docks,

39:48.879 --> 39:50.780
And they're only
getting started.

39:50.847 --> 39:51.947
About Tony --
what happened?

39:52.015 --> 39:53.115
He's in the miami-dade
prison hospital.

39:53.183 --> 39:55.318
Charged with killing gio.

39:55.385 --> 39:57.953
I don't think anyone will be
hearing from him for a while.

39:58.021 --> 39:59.555
What happens when people
start asking questions

39:59.623 --> 40:01.357
About the security team
that cleaned up the docks.

40:01.425 --> 40:02.425
What should I say?

40:02.492 --> 40:03.426
Uh...

40:05.329 --> 40:07.096
Probably best
if you don't say anything.

40:07.164 --> 40:08.731
Some stories,
you just don't tell.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.902
So, got some information
on that cargo plane

40:28.970 --> 40:31.004
That was in the hangar
at, uh, Opa-Locka.

40:31.072 --> 40:33.073
Last flight --
the Bahamas.

40:33.141 --> 40:34.541
And wouldn't you know it?

40:34.609 --> 40:36.944
Same day a John Doe
washed ashore.

40:37.011 --> 40:39.146
Ah. I should head down there
and check it out.

40:39.214 --> 40:40.714
Fiona has some connections.

40:40.782 --> 40:42.482
She can make some arrangements.

40:42.550 --> 40:44.518
What, you can get me
off the no-fly list?

40:44.586 --> 40:46.320
Not exactly, but I can get you

40:46.387 --> 40:48.522
Into the cargo bay
of a cigarette boat.

40:48.590 --> 40:50.858
Trip's about two hours.

40:50.925 --> 40:53.293
Can't think of a nicer way
to spend a Saturday.

40:59.267 --> 41:01.134
Mom, you came to visit?
What's the occasion?

41:01.202 --> 41:04.371
The occasion?
How about what you did to Jesse?

41:04.439 --> 41:05.672
I don't know
what he told you --

41:05.740 --> 41:07.241
He didn't tell me anything,

41:07.308 --> 41:09.276
Except that he lost his job
last month.

41:09.344 --> 41:11.645
And you think I have something to do with that?
Michael, just stop!

41:13.414 --> 41:16.316
I was there when you decided
to join the army,

41:16.384 --> 41:17.484
And I remember
the look on your face

41:17.552 --> 41:18.719
When you had to tell
your brother about it,

41:18.786 --> 41:20.120
How you felt like
you were betraying him

41:20.188 --> 41:21.521
By leaving him behind
with your father.

41:21.589 --> 41:23.290
And you had
the same look on your face

41:23.358 --> 41:24.791
When you brought Jesse around!

41:24.859 --> 41:27.361
I knew you did
this kind of stuff,

41:27.428 --> 41:29.162
But seeing it up close
and personal like this is...

41:31.666 --> 41:33.133
You know, you have no idea

41:33.201 --> 41:35.102
How delicate
of a situation I'm in.

41:35.169 --> 41:36.937
There are things
you don't know,

41:37.005 --> 41:39.539
Things I can't talk about,
things I can't explain.

41:39.607 --> 41:40.974
Oh, please.

41:41.042 --> 41:44.177
I'm not gonna give away
your secret, Michael.

41:44.245 --> 41:46.179
I just want to know how you can
pretend to be his friend.

41:46.247 --> 41:48.282
I am his friend! I'm the best
friend he has right now!

41:48.349 --> 41:49.583
<i>I'm helping him!</i>

41:49.651 --> 41:51.285
<i>You're lying to him!</i>

41:51.352 --> 41:53.921
Take it from me, lies get out.

41:53.988 --> 41:57.524
30 years with your father
taught me that.
