00:25.380 --> 00:27.180
Thank you.

00:27.180 --> 00:30.060
Thank you.

00:33.340 --> 00:35.060
Hello and welcome to Top Gear.

00:35.060 --> 00:38.300
I'm here, he's here, he's
still here, and you're all here!

00:41.820 --> 00:44.660
Yes. How good is this?
How good is this?

00:44.660 --> 00:48.580
It's so good to be presenting our
first show and we know Top Gear

00:48.580 --> 00:51.100
has had more rebirths than
Doctor Who recently,

00:51.100 --> 00:53.100
but look, we've kept
the little Dalek.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.140
Yeah!

00:58.140 --> 01:02.260
And I would just like to say...
Exterminate!

01:02.260 --> 01:05.140
..that I genuinely...
Exterminate, no?

01:05.140 --> 01:08.580
I genuinely cannot understand
a single word you two are saying.

01:08.580 --> 01:11.220
It's just mangled
northern vowels, isn't it?

01:11.220 --> 01:14.220
Probably for the best, to be honest.
Right, let's get on with the show.

01:14.220 --> 01:16.780
We'll be with you every Sunday
for the next few weeks,

01:16.780 --> 01:19.220
and here's
what you've got to look forward to.

01:26.820 --> 01:27.940
Oh!

01:31.180 --> 01:32.220
Come on.

01:32.220 --> 01:34.380
We're going in!

01:36.940 --> 01:38.420
Oh!

01:39.860 --> 01:42.620
Get in, Sam! Argh!

01:42.620 --> 01:45.940
That's the funniest face
I've ever seen.

01:49.940 --> 01:51.620
I've no engine. Argh!

01:52.580 --> 01:55.140
All right, Chris, I've got this.

01:57.860 --> 01:59.860
Are you all right?

02:02.780 --> 02:04.780
Oh, you absolute whopper.

02:04.780 --> 02:06.220
He's a berk.

02:06.220 --> 02:08.500
Hello, patty, patty cake.

02:08.500 --> 02:11.100
Oh, God, it's the German. I thought
they got rid of her.

02:15.020 --> 02:16.340
Stop the car!

02:35.860 --> 02:38.820
My name is Chris Harris
and I am a chassis enthusiast.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.020
Wow, wow.

02:55.820 --> 02:59.260
So basically what you need to know
is that he crashes

02:59.260 --> 03:01.380
everything he drives.

03:01.380 --> 03:05.940
And he gets terrified if he travels
more than ten miles from Bolton!

03:05.940 --> 03:09.620
And as it is our first show,
we wanted to go right back

03:09.620 --> 03:11.980
to the beginning - first cars.
Yeah.

03:11.980 --> 03:15.860
Did you know that the average young
person now spends £4,000

03:15.860 --> 03:17.260
on their first car?
Four grand!

03:17.260 --> 03:19.580
And it's not that they're buying
some future classic.

03:19.580 --> 03:22.180
It's going to be a bit mundane,
it's going to be economical,

03:22.180 --> 03:25.540
practical, like an Aygo,
or a Picanto or something.

03:25.540 --> 03:27.860
When we were younger,
first cars were exciting

03:27.860 --> 03:30.340
and they were cheap.
They don't know they're born, Chris.

03:30.340 --> 03:31.900
They don't know they're born, no.

03:31.900 --> 03:33.620
So the producer said, prove it.

03:33.620 --> 03:37.020
They gave us each four grand
and told us to buy the nearest thing

03:37.020 --> 03:38.980
to our own first car
that we could find,

03:38.980 --> 03:42.260
and then they said,
take them to Ethiopia.

03:42.260 --> 03:43.300
Obviously.

03:56.140 --> 03:58.180
Look at this, the bustle
of an African town.

03:58.180 --> 03:59.260
Nothing beats it.

03:59.260 --> 04:01.420
What do you make of it, Paddy?

04:03.380 --> 04:05.980
It's mind-blowing, isn't it, really?

04:09.180 --> 04:11.980
I'm quite excited
about receiving my car, to be honest.

04:11.980 --> 04:13.540
Really? Yeah.

04:13.540 --> 04:15.860
Mine's a car that's
impossible to dislike.

04:15.860 --> 04:17.899
I'd say mine is as well,
Paddy, to be honest.

04:17.899 --> 04:19.500
Really? Yeah.

04:19.500 --> 04:20.899
He's being very quiet, isn't he?

04:20.899 --> 04:23.020
Well, I'm just, I'm just
soaking up the memories.

04:23.020 --> 04:26.540
The last time I saw my version
of the car that we're about to meet,

04:26.540 --> 04:30.260
it was upside down in
Knowle West playing field,

04:30.260 --> 04:33.380
on fire, cos someone had nicked
it, so I feel a bit sad about that,

04:33.380 --> 04:35.860
and then you talk about
the things that I did in the car.

04:35.860 --> 04:38.860
I'm not sure they are suitable
for a family show, actually.

04:38.860 --> 04:41.500
Don't pretend, don't pretend you had
girls in there, Chris!

04:41.500 --> 04:42.540
On his own!

04:42.540 --> 04:43.580
On your own.

04:55.660 --> 04:58.100
Is this it? This is it.

04:58.100 --> 04:59.140
Cheers, mate.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.700
Very excited, sun's out.
Wait there.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.420
I'm going to get my car.

05:06.780 --> 05:09.580
Ladies.
What are you thinking?

05:09.580 --> 05:13.860
Late '80s, Bolton - Ford Fiesta.

05:13.860 --> 05:15.260
MK1?

05:15.260 --> 05:17.580
No, it will be a MK2 or maybe...

05:17.580 --> 05:19.660
Oh!

05:19.660 --> 05:20.700
Is it a Ford?

05:23.500 --> 05:26.140
Turn round, look at that!

05:26.140 --> 05:28.460
Oh. MK2 Escort.

05:28.460 --> 05:30.460
That is lovely.
That's a delicious car.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.860
I'm not going to tell him, though.
Wow. Wow. Hey!

05:33.900 --> 05:35.860
Hey!

05:35.860 --> 05:39.100
The MK2 Escort, boys.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.340
Rolling back the years.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.900
Look at her.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.860
Look at her, come on.
Don't give me that face.

05:43.860 --> 05:46.060
No, no, I don't know
whether to congratulate you,

05:46.060 --> 05:47.740
cos the car's wonderful.
Thank you.

05:47.740 --> 05:49.740
Or to point out that
you're a cheating sod.

05:49.740 --> 05:50.780
Why?

05:52.340 --> 05:54.660
Gauteng.
Where did you buy that?

05:54.660 --> 05:57.180
Yeah, well, this is
the genius of it all. Yes.

05:57.180 --> 05:59.540
These cars in the UK,
you're looking anything

05:59.540 --> 06:02.140
between ten grand and 30 grand.
Yes.

06:02.140 --> 06:05.300
South Africa, £2,100.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.740
Went on the net, boom - job done.

06:07.740 --> 06:09.260
You went on the net?
Went on the net.

06:09.260 --> 06:11.500
What came up when you
googled "old escorts"?

06:11.500 --> 06:15.780
You don't want to know,
and I've since burnt my hard drive,

06:15.780 --> 06:18.500
but this is a thing of beauty.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.140
I'm not going to lie, Paddy.

06:20.140 --> 06:22.660
You've pulled it out
of the bag here, mate.

06:22.660 --> 06:23.860
You like it, don't you?

06:23.860 --> 06:25.020
That steering wheel.

06:25.020 --> 06:27.660
Lovely, isn't it?
I, oh... How do you do it?

06:27.660 --> 06:28.980
Just pull that handle, Fred.

06:28.980 --> 06:31.140
I know you get...
It's the basics with Fred.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.340
Look at this!
It's beautiful.

06:33.340 --> 06:35.500
Its little touches.
Why are you so miserable?

06:35.500 --> 06:38.100
Because I'm, I feel
I've been beaten already.

06:38.100 --> 06:39.220
A British classic.

06:39.220 --> 06:41.020
I think it's a great car in a great

06:41.020 --> 06:43.420
colour and he's bought it for great
money.

06:43.420 --> 06:45.980
See what you've got there, raise it.
This is music to my ears.

06:45.980 --> 06:48.380
However, however,
you wait till you see

06:48.380 --> 06:50.420
what I've got, boys.
Really?

06:51.500 --> 06:53.500
What do you think it's going to be?

06:53.500 --> 06:55.460
It's going to be small, isn't it?

06:55.460 --> 06:57.180
I'm praying this is him.

06:58.220 --> 07:00.100
A horse!

07:00.100 --> 07:01.900
I've gone old school British, lads.

07:01.900 --> 07:04.100
First car I ever had.

07:05.340 --> 07:07.700
Oh, here he comes, look at this.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.700
As if it was going
to be any other car. Yeah.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.820
The tuk-tuks are bigger.

07:14.820 --> 07:17.140
The tuk-tuks are
bigger than his car!

07:17.140 --> 07:18.380
Look at... he's smiling.

07:18.380 --> 07:20.060
Chris! Wow.

07:20.060 --> 07:21.100
Now...

07:22.180 --> 07:23.740
Look at his little face.

07:23.740 --> 07:25.100
I tell you what.

07:25.100 --> 07:27.260
Oh, here we go.
I'm wistful. Are you?

07:27.260 --> 07:29.180
You're wistful.

07:29.180 --> 07:31.860
What year is this?
Gorgeous. 1990.

07:31.860 --> 07:34.180
It's a little bit younger than mine,
but it's the same spec.

07:34.180 --> 07:37.780
It's lovely.
998CC, four speed gearbox.

07:37.780 --> 07:41.020
I mean, the genius of Issigonis'
design.

07:41.020 --> 07:43.260
Put the gearbox under the engine.
Yeah.

07:43.260 --> 07:45.020
Less space up front required.

07:45.020 --> 07:46.220
What did you pay for this?

07:46.220 --> 07:47.660
3,300.

07:47.660 --> 07:50.380
I paid a grand for my original one.
They're worth good money now.

07:50.380 --> 07:53.260
You're genuinely
excited, aren't you? Look at you.

07:53.260 --> 07:54.660
Of course I am, it's arguably

07:54.660 --> 07:56.580
the greatest British object ever
made.

07:56.580 --> 07:59.420
I've got it, listen,
I like the Mini.

07:59.420 --> 08:02.100
I can't wait to see his.
Should I just go and get it?

08:02.100 --> 08:03.220
Yeah.

08:03.220 --> 08:04.500
Go on.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.420
What do you reckon he's got?

08:06.420 --> 08:08.220
First of all look at
the size of him.

08:08.220 --> 08:11.500
He's a big bloke, big car -
I'm saying Land Rover.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.420
What, for a first car?

08:15.540 --> 08:18.660
I'd keep, I'm sorry. What's that?
That...

08:18.660 --> 08:20.820
No way.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.060
No way!

08:26.340 --> 08:28.300
First car. What?

08:31.220 --> 08:33.380
All right, lads?
That's a Porsche Boxster.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.780
Hey, you know your cars, don't you?

08:35.780 --> 08:38.100
Your first car was
a Porsche Boxster?

08:38.100 --> 08:41.780
Well, I did have a Rover 216
when I passed my test,

08:41.780 --> 08:43.179
but it was a lease car.
Right.

08:43.179 --> 08:45.380
Then I had a few sponsored cars.

08:45.380 --> 08:47.380
Hang on, you leased a Rover?

08:47.380 --> 08:49.980
Lancashire, you paid 1%
of the car's value a month

08:49.980 --> 08:52.900
and you got your insurance.
A no-brainer. The first car

08:52.900 --> 08:54.820
I actually bought
was when I was 22.

08:54.820 --> 08:56.140
It was a Porsche Boxster.

08:56.140 --> 08:58.660
So at 22 years of age,
how much did you pay for that at 22?

08:58.660 --> 09:01.140
At 22 years of age I'd been
a professional cricketer

09:01.140 --> 09:03.220
for six years. And?

09:03.220 --> 09:07.020
The car was 35 grand.

09:07.020 --> 09:08.980
30...

09:08.980 --> 09:11.860
35 grand, 22!

09:11.860 --> 09:14.500
You played cricket,
is that what you get, you lads?

09:14.500 --> 09:16.340
So you know all this,
"I grew up the hard way,

09:16.340 --> 09:18.980
"Lancashire, took my own coal
to school, had to burn other

09:18.980 --> 09:21.820
"children and eat other
people to live"... It was all...

09:21.820 --> 09:23.540
I made my debut for England at 20.

09:23.540 --> 09:26.580
What happened was, right, I found a
talent young, when I was 16.

09:26.580 --> 09:28.020
I was a professional cricketer.

09:28.020 --> 09:29.940
You two, you're still
on that journey.

09:29.940 --> 09:31.940
It'll happen to you one day, lads.

09:31.940 --> 09:34.020
Absolutely speechless.
It doesn't happen often.

09:34.020 --> 09:35.060
How much?

09:35.060 --> 09:36.900
£3,700.

09:36.900 --> 09:39.260
You paid £400 more
than I did for this?

09:39.260 --> 09:41.460
For a Porsche Boxster? Yeah.
Yeah. How many miles has it done?

09:41.460 --> 09:44.100
124,000.

09:44.100 --> 09:46.740
Eh up, oh.

09:46.740 --> 09:47.780
Thank you.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.700
Welcome to Ethiopia.

09:51.820 --> 09:55.500
If your first cars are as good
as you say, they'll have no problem

09:55.500 --> 10:00.740
crossing the vast Semian mountain
range to reach the Afar Triangle.

10:00.740 --> 10:07.340
Birthplace of humankind
and the hottest place on Earth.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.700
Get an 'at.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.620
And you owe me a fiver. Why?

10:10.620 --> 10:12.260
You can read.

10:12.260 --> 10:13.860
I told you I can read.

10:15.660 --> 10:19.900
So this was the journey
we'd need to overcome.

10:19.900 --> 10:24.380
A three-day trek across Ethiopia's
ancient mountainous landscapes

10:24.380 --> 10:28.940
to reach the deep desert depression
of the Afar Triangle,

10:28.940 --> 10:32.540
the lowest point in Africa,
long thought to be the area

10:32.540 --> 10:36.260
where humankind took its first
steps into the world.

10:41.540 --> 10:45.220
Not a bad place for a nostalgic road
trip, then,

10:45.220 --> 10:49.100
but a big ask of our first cars.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.340
Although it sounds good
that I bought a Porsche

10:51.340 --> 10:53.820
for under four grand,
I'll let you into a little secret.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.620
I'm not going to tell the other two.

10:55.620 --> 10:57.500
I've had to compromise a little bit.

10:57.500 --> 11:00.620
The clutch is slippy,
it's prone to overheating,

11:00.620 --> 11:02.580
which is not great in this weather.

11:02.580 --> 11:06.060
I've got no air conditioning.
After you, yeah, you carry on.

11:06.060 --> 11:09.220
Yeah, the roof is not working,
hence why I've got it up.

11:09.220 --> 11:12.220
But I'm in a Porsche!

11:14.300 --> 11:18.020
This is what the Mini was built for.

11:18.020 --> 11:22.700
Urban chaos, small and nimble,
I can duck into gaps.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.340
I just love it.

11:24.340 --> 11:25.620
I love being in a Mini.

11:25.620 --> 11:27.780
I've forgotten how much
I love being in a Mini.

11:27.780 --> 11:29.460
Come back, brake pedal.

11:35.100 --> 11:38.100
Being back in my first car,
the first car I bought

11:38.100 --> 11:40.220
with my own money that
I'd worked hard for,

11:40.220 --> 11:43.780
I worked at Morrisons at the time,
worked in the warehouse,

11:43.780 --> 11:47.820
90 quid I saved up, and everything
about this car is exactly

11:47.820 --> 11:50.500
as it is when I owned it.

11:50.500 --> 11:55.140
In fact, this is in better condition
than my original car,

11:55.140 --> 11:59.060
because the original MK2 I had,
the steering rack was hanging off,

11:59.060 --> 12:01.580
the carburettor was all over
the show, that's why I swapped

12:01.580 --> 12:03.020
it for the twin Webers.

12:03.020 --> 12:04.740
This is actually better.

12:08.620 --> 12:11.980
Leaving the city of Gondar behind,
we headed north-east

12:11.980 --> 12:15.540
towards the Semian mountains
and our first glimpse

12:15.540 --> 12:17.460
at what Ethiopia had in store.

12:17.460 --> 12:19.740
That is amazing.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.540
Beautiful.

12:26.420 --> 12:30.260
It's safe to say I'm not
a very well travelled man.

12:30.260 --> 12:32.260
Portugal's about
as far as I've gone,

12:32.260 --> 12:36.980
but growing up in the '80s the only
thing you saw of Ethiopia on the TV

12:36.980 --> 12:39.660
was really famine and Live Aid

12:39.660 --> 12:43.580
and the images were harrowing,
and I'm out here now

12:43.580 --> 12:45.100
and it's totally different.

12:45.100 --> 12:49.700
Obviously it was a long time ago
but it's a beautiful country.

12:50.860 --> 12:56.820
And with a lot of it to cover,
we settled in for the drive.

12:56.820 --> 12:59.020
You know what,
I'm not an emotional person,

12:59.020 --> 13:00.820
I don't really get emotional, but

13:00.820 --> 13:03.980
this car, driving it again is
stirring up a few thoughts.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.820
Not all that I'm proud
of, to be honest.

13:09.820 --> 13:14.060
I think a lot of sportsmen,
or people go through that stage

13:14.060 --> 13:17.660
in your life, where
you're a bit of a knobhead.

13:19.660 --> 13:22.020
I played for England,
I thought I was cracking it,

13:22.020 --> 13:24.500
but my career was terrible,
I wasn't scoring any runs,

13:24.500 --> 13:27.700
I wasn't taking any wickets,
I was unfit and I took my eye

13:27.700 --> 13:29.180
off the ball.

13:29.180 --> 13:32.220
I got carried away with everything
off the field and didn't concentrate

13:32.220 --> 13:33.540
what was going on on the field.

13:33.540 --> 13:37.620
And when I sold it,
my career turned round.

13:37.620 --> 13:39.180
I realised what's important.

13:39.180 --> 13:41.660
If I get my cricket right,
if I get my game right,

13:41.660 --> 13:44.620
all the things like the cars,
the house and all that will follow,

13:44.620 --> 13:48.100
but I've got to get that right,
and it sounds strange to say

13:48.100 --> 13:52.460
but, yeah, it really did teach me
a lesson, this car.

13:52.460 --> 13:57.540
It was time we started finding out
who really had the best first car,

13:57.540 --> 13:59.340
and a little further up the road...

13:59.340 --> 14:01.900
Wow, look at that down there.

14:01.900 --> 14:04.980
Lads, I've got a fantastic idea.

14:04.980 --> 14:09.660
..I spotted a good place to knock
together a little nostalgic test.

14:12.220 --> 14:14.300
Lovely this, Chris, isn't it?

14:16.300 --> 14:18.340
Gentlemen, welcome to

14:18.340 --> 14:21.380
the Driving Test Greatest
Hits Rally Race.

14:21.380 --> 14:24.380
Basically, all of your favourite
bits of the driving test

14:24.380 --> 14:26.540
wrapped up in a rally stage, OK?

14:26.540 --> 14:29.340
Down here, flat out,
round through the equipment,

14:29.340 --> 14:31.660
down there, emergency stop,
three-point turn.

14:31.660 --> 14:32.820
Were you good at that?
No.

14:32.820 --> 14:35.060
And then reverse all the way
back through the course,

14:35.060 --> 14:37.020
back up there, don't go
up through the barrel

14:37.020 --> 14:39.740
because it's about 90 foot
down into the quarry.

14:39.740 --> 14:42.340
It's your go, isn't it?
You go first, your game. Ow!

14:42.340 --> 14:44.940
Go on, yeah, go on, the
Smurf, go on, Papa Smurf.

14:44.940 --> 14:46.140
Go on, son.

14:46.140 --> 14:47.380
Bless him.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.660
Are you ready, Chris?
Yeah.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.620
No pressure, but you're an actual
racing driver so you've got

14:56.620 --> 14:58.780
to win this.
I'm not a racing driver.

14:58.780 --> 15:00.420
I do some racing.

15:00.420 --> 15:03.780
Three, two, one, go!

15:05.380 --> 15:06.580
Come on, old girl.

15:06.580 --> 15:09.260
I thought he was going
to be faster down there.

15:09.260 --> 15:11.620
Right, I'm going to finish first.

15:11.620 --> 15:14.180
We're at altitude,
2,500 metres here,

15:14.180 --> 15:16.340
and the Mini is a rally weapon.

15:16.340 --> 15:17.620
Come on, Mini.

15:17.620 --> 15:19.420
I'm Paddy Hopkirk.

15:19.420 --> 15:23.500
I'm Rauno Aaltonen, I'm every
Mini rally hero ever!

15:24.940 --> 15:27.900
Nice, tidy through the chicane.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.500
We need to slow him down, Fred.

15:29.500 --> 15:33.500
Three-point turn,
what the Mini was made for.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.980
Oh, might have got a bit
of dust going there.

15:35.980 --> 15:38.380
You've gone the wrong way!
You've gone the wrong way!

15:38.380 --> 15:40.700
Oh!
You've gone the wrong way, son!

15:40.700 --> 15:42.420
What's this?

15:42.420 --> 15:44.140
No, you're all right, keep going!

15:44.140 --> 15:46.620
No, you lying BLEEP,
Paddy McGuinness!

15:46.620 --> 15:48.700
He's having an absolute 'mare.

15:48.700 --> 15:49.900
He's 55 seconds.

15:51.020 --> 15:52.660
I can't see a thing.

15:55.780 --> 15:56.820
Go on, Chris!

16:02.980 --> 16:05.500
You shouted, you've
gone the wrong way!

16:05.500 --> 16:07.700
Don't listen to us. Play to the
whistle, Chris.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.340
What were you listening to us for?

16:09.340 --> 16:12.940
That's a horrendous piece
of cheating, Paddy McGuinness.

16:12.940 --> 16:15.260
My God.

16:15.260 --> 16:18.700
One minute 21 to beat.

16:18.700 --> 16:21.980
And McGuinness and his
Escort were up next.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.300
Three, two, one, go.

16:26.460 --> 16:27.580
Come on.

16:29.340 --> 16:32.260
Does that look visually
quicker than I was going? Yeah.

16:32.260 --> 16:34.260
Does it?
Yeah, it does.

16:34.260 --> 16:35.980
Wide line here, wide line.

16:35.980 --> 16:39.100
Whoa, whoa, round we go,
round we go,

16:39.100 --> 16:41.340
there we go, back end out,

16:41.340 --> 16:43.220
let's get on it.

16:43.220 --> 16:46.780
He's quicker than
you at this point, Chris.

16:46.780 --> 16:49.020
Is he?
Yeah, he really is.

16:49.020 --> 16:52.580
Now this three-point turn now,
here we go, straight

16:52.580 --> 16:53.820
up into this.

16:56.980 --> 17:00.780
Paddy, you're on fire,
your car is on fire, stop! Stop!

17:00.780 --> 17:02.260
Oh, sorry about that, no.

17:02.260 --> 17:04.380
Carry on, buddy, carry on.
You BLEEP!

17:08.300 --> 17:10.700
I can't believe he's gone for that!

17:10.700 --> 17:13.180
He's spewing, look at him!

17:15.260 --> 17:16.859
I wondered what you were doing.

17:16.859 --> 17:19.220
You got me then as well!

17:23.500 --> 17:24.700
Run, run, run.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.020
Come on, come on.

17:27.859 --> 17:30.420
It's going to be close this,
Chris, one minute ten.

17:30.420 --> 17:32.540
Go, Paddy!
What do you mean, go, Paddy?

17:32.540 --> 17:35.420
That's it, never leaves you.
Jesus Christ.

17:35.420 --> 17:36.700
Jesus!

17:36.700 --> 17:39.700
Oh, he's gone, he's gone,
he was going to do you then as well.

17:39.700 --> 17:41.700
Oh, where is he going?
No!

17:45.220 --> 17:48.100
And stop there.
One minute, 27, point 66.

17:48.100 --> 17:51.300
What did I do?
1.21. Cheating BLEEP.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.820
Oh, he doesn't like it
when it's him, does he?

17:53.820 --> 17:56.140
Do you want to know the time now?
Go on.

17:56.140 --> 17:59.020
One minute, 27.66.

17:59.020 --> 18:00.980
Oh, what a pisstake.

18:00.980 --> 18:03.860
All I can say is your performance
was woeful, cheats never prosper,

18:03.860 --> 18:05.540
back you come.

18:05.540 --> 18:07.020
A moral victory for me.

18:07.020 --> 18:09.300
Cheats never prosper.
Oh, yeah.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.660
I've got no chance!

18:13.500 --> 18:15.060
You ready, son?

18:15.060 --> 18:16.740
Ready, big lad.

18:16.740 --> 18:19.460
Three, two, one, go.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.540
Quick start.

18:25.460 --> 18:28.580
Come on, nice, nice
and smooth through here.

18:29.540 --> 18:32.020
It's all over the place!

18:32.020 --> 18:34.180
The back end, it's too much power.

18:34.180 --> 18:37.340
Is this the bit where I say,
your car's got a grenade on top

18:37.340 --> 18:39.260
of it and rocket
launchers everywhere?

18:39.260 --> 18:41.220
I can't see a thing!

18:41.220 --> 18:43.740
I can't see a thing at the back.

18:43.740 --> 18:46.820
He can't see!

18:46.820 --> 18:48.300
He can't see.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.580
Get it round, get it round,
come on, don't panic.

18:51.580 --> 18:52.980
Where the BLEEP is it?

18:52.980 --> 18:58.140
I can't see anything
out the back.

18:58.140 --> 18:59.700
I'm stuck!

19:00.820 --> 19:02.420
I'm stuck! No!

19:04.460 --> 19:09.580
He's beached it, he's beached it.
Shush, shush. Hear it. No!

19:12.100 --> 19:15.100
It's still running.
We're going.

19:15.100 --> 19:18.780
Here you go, see it.
Oh, good arm.

19:18.780 --> 19:21.180
Now, OK, so we've got
a winner and a loser. Yeah.

19:21.180 --> 19:25.660
The winner of my Greatest Driving
Test Hits Classic Rally Challenge

19:25.660 --> 19:28.900
thing, I have to present
the loser with his prize.

19:30.580 --> 19:32.860
Sorry about this.
Loser?

19:32.860 --> 19:35.020
Well, you did lose.
OK.

19:35.020 --> 19:36.660
Oh, dear God.

19:36.660 --> 19:39.580
As the loser, Andrew Flintoff,
I'd like to present

19:39.580 --> 19:43.900
you with the chunky
knit jumper of failure,

19:43.900 --> 19:46.700
to be worn until our next challenge.

19:48.140 --> 19:49.380
Get it on.

19:49.380 --> 19:53.260
Roll neck as well,
that will be lovely and warm.

19:53.260 --> 19:56.980
Now that's it, be careful
snagging your teeth on it.

19:56.980 --> 19:59.780
Beautiful, that. How hot is it now?
85, 87?

19:59.780 --> 20:01.620
It's a bit clammy.

20:01.620 --> 20:03.620
Shall we get back on the road?

20:03.620 --> 20:05.660
Yeah. I'll catch you up.

20:10.900 --> 20:13.100
I think failing my driving test was

20:13.100 --> 20:15.900
one of the worst days
of my life.

20:15.900 --> 20:17.860
What did you fail on, Chris?

20:17.860 --> 20:21.460
Couldn't reach the pedals!

20:21.460 --> 20:22.900
When did you pass, Fred?

20:22.900 --> 20:24.500
Third time.

20:24.500 --> 20:28.460
I passed the second time
and I'm not proud of it,

20:28.460 --> 20:31.260
but I used my sexuality.
Go on.

20:31.260 --> 20:34.220
What happened was the first time
it was a guy with a little pencil

20:34.220 --> 20:36.580
'tache, I knew I were going
to fail straight away.

20:36.580 --> 20:39.660
I was a young good-looking lad
from Bolton, he got a bit jealous.

20:39.660 --> 20:43.300
Anyhow, the second time
it was a lady instructor,

20:43.300 --> 20:47.180
and what you two boys don't know
is underneath these trousers

20:47.180 --> 20:51.060
I've got two sticks of dynamite,
known as my legs,

20:51.060 --> 20:55.220
and when I was a young lad, oh,
they were tanned and they were lean.

20:55.220 --> 21:01.740
I had this pair of the shortest blue
silk shorts, little white ankle

21:01.740 --> 21:06.180
socks and a skin-tight Juventus
football top

21:06.180 --> 21:09.300
and I passed
with flying colours, boys.

21:12.020 --> 21:15.900
Have you ever used your sexuality
for anything, Chris?

21:22.260 --> 21:24.180
Harris' detour had left

21:24.180 --> 21:27.340
the morning's silky smooth tarmac
far behind us.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.860
This is pretty sketchy
at the minute.

21:30.860 --> 21:32.820
Just don't think about
the drop to your right.

21:32.820 --> 21:36.220
That's the best way,
just imagine it's about a foot.

21:36.220 --> 21:41.940
I mean, if at any point
this steering rack goes awry for me

21:41.940 --> 21:44.820
on this road, it's game over.

21:46.220 --> 21:48.820
We've now climbed high
into the mountains.

21:48.820 --> 21:50.940
Good God, look at that.

21:50.940 --> 21:53.980
And for me in the Boxster the state
of the road was the least

21:53.980 --> 21:56.020
of our problems.

21:56.020 --> 21:58.980
I've lost one of the fans,
which I think was in the quarry,

21:58.980 --> 22:03.020
but it's a bump so obviously
temperature gauge is up to 100.

22:03.020 --> 22:05.420
The air conditioning doesn't work.

22:05.420 --> 22:07.700
My roof doesn't work.

22:07.700 --> 22:09.060
So hot in here.

22:10.180 --> 22:14.060
But then Paddy's Escort
gave us all a break.

22:14.060 --> 22:16.180
Oy, pull in, pull in.
Oh!

22:18.540 --> 22:19.820
Flat.

22:19.820 --> 22:23.500
The rules are I've got
to wear the jumper.

22:24.820 --> 22:29.700
Nobody said anything
about wearing my trousers.

22:35.460 --> 22:37.380
Oh, that's better.

22:37.380 --> 22:39.660
What, what, what has
happened to your...

22:39.660 --> 22:41.420
Oh, Jesus wept.

22:41.420 --> 22:44.340
What's up, Pad?

22:50.780 --> 22:54.380
Now, buying a car over the internet
can have its pitfalls.

22:54.380 --> 22:56.620
How are you going
to get that on that?

22:56.620 --> 22:58.220
Where's the jack?

22:58.220 --> 23:00.820
Luckily, though, Harris knew
an old rally technique

23:00.820 --> 23:02.340
that could help us out.

23:02.340 --> 23:04.740
Drive the car into a ditch.

23:04.740 --> 23:09.260
You want me to drive this car
with a flat tyre into a ditch?

23:09.260 --> 23:10.460
Come on, Paddy.

23:10.460 --> 23:11.900
All you do is crash the car...

23:11.900 --> 23:13.660
Stop.

23:13.660 --> 23:16.500
Get yourself in an utterly
inappropriate position on the boot.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.220
The right foot should be rising up.

23:18.220 --> 23:19.940
It's rising up, Chris, trust me.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.180
And invite some locals
over to join in.

23:22.180 --> 23:23.700
Thanks, lads.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.420
Right, we're up, we're up.

23:25.420 --> 23:27.660
I'm just getting a bit,
I need to adjust myself.

23:27.660 --> 23:28.820
No, no!

23:28.820 --> 23:31.260
It's horrible!

23:31.260 --> 23:32.700
Will you hurry up?

23:32.700 --> 23:34.660
Right, let me down.

23:34.660 --> 23:37.140
Fred, Fred get off me.

23:38.260 --> 23:40.660
All of which, remarkably...
Ready?

23:40.660 --> 23:41.940
Yeah, go.

23:41.940 --> 23:43.420
..did the trick.

23:43.420 --> 23:45.140
We're on, boys!

23:47.740 --> 23:52.100
Back up and running we got
reacquainted with the dirt road.

23:53.300 --> 23:56.540
Man, it's dusty.

23:56.540 --> 24:00.220
But before long, our
perseverance paid off.

24:00.220 --> 24:04.220
Lads, eyes forward,
look what's over that bridge.

24:04.220 --> 24:06.780
We found tarmac boys!

24:10.780 --> 24:13.420
Oh, the Porsche is
stretching its legs.

24:13.420 --> 24:15.300
Oh, look at this up here?

24:15.300 --> 24:20.060
Oh, go on!

24:20.060 --> 24:23.940
Just when we were finally making
some decent progress, though...

24:23.940 --> 24:27.820
Oh, I don't like that,
every time I drop a gear and start

24:27.820 --> 24:30.940
climbing, my temperature gauge
just goes straight up.

24:30.940 --> 24:34.660
Lads, I hate to do this to you,
but I have to pull over.

24:34.660 --> 24:36.740
Oh, you are kidding me?

24:36.740 --> 24:37.780
Brilliant.

24:45.140 --> 24:46.620
Well, we can't stay here.

24:46.620 --> 24:50.420
We can't stay here,
in the middle of nowhere.

24:50.420 --> 24:55.980
When I was changing the tyre before,
there's an old tow rope in the back.

24:55.980 --> 24:58.780
Right.

24:58.780 --> 24:59.860
The indignity.

24:59.860 --> 25:02.060
You all right, you're all right.

25:02.060 --> 25:04.380
I'm not I'm being towed by
Paddy McGuinness.

25:04.380 --> 25:05.900
Right, let's give it a whirl.

25:07.780 --> 25:08.820
You ready?

25:08.820 --> 25:10.780
All right, mate, nice and easy.

25:12.100 --> 25:14.260
Go on.

25:15.500 --> 25:18.060
We're off.

25:18.060 --> 25:22.500
I'm just in a MK2 Escort
in Ethiopia towing a Porsche Boxer.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.660
Other side of the road, Paddy.

25:25.780 --> 25:29.100
Other side of the road, Paddy!

25:29.100 --> 25:31.780
Paddy, other side of the road.

25:31.780 --> 25:34.580
That's a very good point, Fred.

25:43.620 --> 25:45.580
I get confused. In the heat.

25:45.580 --> 25:49.940
Never mind any of that,
I never thought I'd see the day

25:49.940 --> 25:52.340
that a Porsche gets towed
off a little old Escort.

25:52.340 --> 25:54.060
You should be ashamed of yourself.

25:54.060 --> 25:56.300
That's a bit rich from a man
they didn't know what side

25:56.300 --> 25:57.340
of the road to drive on.

25:57.340 --> 26:00.260
Like, seriously, have you travelled
anywhere around the word

26:00.260 --> 26:01.500
apart from Benidorm?

26:01.500 --> 26:04.020
And technically that is England.

26:04.020 --> 26:08.460
I was distracted by your
massive big pasty legs.

26:08.460 --> 26:10.060
Too much white flesh on show.

26:10.060 --> 26:13.060
It was like towing
a Christmas turkey.

26:13.060 --> 26:16.180
Anyway, we'll get back to Ethiopia,
and you two clowns.

26:16.180 --> 26:18.900
But first let's talk about fast
Ferraris. Have a look at these.

26:18.900 --> 26:20.940
The greatest hits.

26:20.940 --> 26:26.340
360 Challenge Stradale,
430 Scuderia, 458 Speciale.

26:26.340 --> 26:30.940
Yep, for track focused supercars,
Ferrari was always the place to go.

26:30.940 --> 26:34.300
And from the look of its latest
efforts, it still is.

26:34.300 --> 26:35.860
Flintoff, you are an arse.

26:35.860 --> 26:38.580
Brilliant, brilliant,
brilliant Chris.

26:42.780 --> 26:44.420
It's called the Pista.

26:44.420 --> 26:48.620
And it costs £250,000.

26:49.700 --> 26:54.900
Based on a Ferraris 488
supercar, it has a 3.9 litre twin

26:54.900 --> 26:57.060
turbo-charged V-8 engine.

26:57.060 --> 27:01.700
Only, where the 488 may do
with 660 horsepower,

27:01.700 --> 27:04.820
this one has over 700.

27:11.700 --> 27:15.340
This is the most powerful
V-8 Ferrari ever made.

27:16.860 --> 27:19.900
It'll do nought to 60
in around 3 seconds.

27:19.900 --> 27:22.660
But then so does every other
grown-up supercar these days.

27:25.100 --> 27:28.060
What really matters here
is that from a standing start,

27:28.060 --> 27:32.380
after 10 seconds it's doing 140mph.

27:32.380 --> 27:35.460
10 seconds.

27:35.460 --> 27:37.820
Crikey, that's fast.

27:45.100 --> 27:50.220
And the 488's comprehensive
rewrite doesn't stop at the engine.

27:50.220 --> 27:55.220
A quarter of a million pounds also
buys you F1 grade aerodynamics

27:55.220 --> 27:59.660
and an exhaust made of inconel,
which is the same stuff they use

27:59.660 --> 28:01.260
in rocket engines.

28:03.340 --> 28:07.420
Inside, meanwhile, every inch
of the interior has been pared back

28:07.420 --> 28:09.820
to save 90 kilos in weight.

28:11.060 --> 28:14.460
All of which makes the Pista
about nine tenths

28:14.460 --> 28:16.620
of a racing car for the road.

28:18.580 --> 28:20.900
Which comes with its downsides.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.980
But if you're going to go
pared back and minimal,

28:22.980 --> 28:25.140
at least make sure it's pleasant.

28:25.140 --> 28:28.660
I mean, this seat here,
it's as bony as an old donkey.

28:28.660 --> 28:31.900
And what's left of the dash,
well, it's 10 years old.

28:31.900 --> 28:34.500
It's from a Ferrari 458.

28:34.500 --> 28:37.500
And then there's this thing
down here, it's a carbon fibre sort

28:37.500 --> 28:39.580
of spur with buttons on it.

28:39.580 --> 28:42.660
It looks like a medieval sex toy.

28:47.460 --> 28:50.020
Beaneath the threadbare surface,
however,

28:50.020 --> 28:53.620
lurks a lot of very clever
electronic assistance.

28:53.620 --> 28:56.620
But not the boring stuff
that boings to warn you that

28:56.620 --> 28:59.460
you're wandering out
of your motorway lane,

28:59.460 --> 29:02.900
or that there's a scooter in your
blind spot - oh, no.

29:02.900 --> 29:04.860
The Pista's computers concern

29:04.860 --> 29:07.980
themselves with something far more
exciting...

29:07.980 --> 29:10.020
Drifts on demand.

29:15.820 --> 29:19.860
Ferrari calls it side
slip angle control 6.

29:21.980 --> 29:26.460
Basically, will tickle a brake
alongside electronic differential,

29:26.460 --> 29:28.500
to keep you in line.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.180
Or rather, out of line.

29:31.180 --> 29:32.220
It's genius.

29:35.740 --> 29:39.260
Sliding a 700 horsepower
Ferrari shouldn't be this easy.

29:39.260 --> 29:44.540
But the Pista makes it child's
play.

29:44.540 --> 29:46.740
There's no question
that with the Pista,

29:46.740 --> 29:49.500
Ferrari has done it again.

29:52.300 --> 29:56.340
What you're looking
at is the new benchmark

29:56.340 --> 29:58.420
for the track focus supercar.

30:00.660 --> 30:04.140
But there is a problem
with being the best,

30:04.140 --> 30:06.340
it does put a target on your back.

30:10.340 --> 30:14.060
And this is the Pista's newest
rival.

30:14.060 --> 30:16.980
The McLaren 600 LT.

30:18.100 --> 30:23.220
This is the latest car to get
McLaren's longtail treatment.

30:23.220 --> 30:29.020
It gets a twin turbo-charged 3.7
litre V-8, and like the Pista,

30:29.020 --> 30:31.220
its main focus is the track.

30:35.420 --> 30:38.860
But with over hundred horsepower
less than the Ferrari,

30:38.860 --> 30:41.740
and starting at £65,000 cheaper,

30:41.740 --> 30:47.780
it shouldn't really be a rival,
at all.

30:47.780 --> 30:51.140
Here's the thing, though,
a couple of years ago McLaren gave

30:51.140 --> 30:56.700
us the 720S that was supposed
to be a rival for the Ferrari 488.

30:57.660 --> 31:01.460
But in reality, it was so much
more advanced and so much faster

31:01.460 --> 31:06.180
than the Ferrari, it might as well
have come from another planet.

31:08.260 --> 31:11.100
And now there's this 600 LT.

31:11.100 --> 31:14.300
Which might be £65,000
cheaper than the Pista,

31:14.300 --> 31:18.340
but I'm not sure it's £65,000
less car.

31:20.220 --> 31:22.260
I reckon this could be very close.

31:42.860 --> 31:44.860
That's 60...

31:44.860 --> 31:48.740
Oh he's gone, he's gone.
Look at him go!

31:48.740 --> 31:50.220
What, come on!

31:50.220 --> 31:53.820
What are we doing, 130,
140, he's pulling away!

31:54.980 --> 31:58.300
Ah, 65 grand does buy you a bit
more straight line performance.

32:02.220 --> 32:04.220
180 over the line.

32:04.220 --> 32:07.820
OK, it's quicker but
it's not night and day.

32:07.820 --> 32:10.340
It's not night and day.

32:13.700 --> 32:16.860
And it's not like McLaren
has been any less committed

32:16.860 --> 32:17.900
to the details.

32:19.060 --> 32:22.940
The Longtail is nearly a 100 kilos
lighter than the 570S

32:22.940 --> 32:25.060
on which its based.

32:25.060 --> 32:30.700
The windscreen is 2mm
thinner, saving 1,500 g.

32:30.700 --> 32:34.700
They've even reworked the exhaust,
to exit straight out the top

32:34.700 --> 32:37.620
for less piping and more flame.

32:44.220 --> 32:47.380
McLaren has gone to town
on this car, bigger carbon

32:47.380 --> 32:48.780
ceramic brakes.

32:48.780 --> 32:52.020
New springs, new dampers,
revised anti-roll bars.

32:54.700 --> 32:58.940
And for me, McLaren is still
the master of the supercar cabin.

32:58.940 --> 33:01.500
I get a great view
straight down on the road,

33:01.500 --> 33:03.940
I can see the top
of the wings there.

33:03.940 --> 33:07.660
It means it's light, airy,
it's not intimidating.

33:10.620 --> 33:13.900
By supercar standards,
it's pretty good value.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.980
Looks like someone wants to play.

33:26.340 --> 33:29.340
Now, we know he's got
more straight-line speed than me,

33:29.340 --> 33:33.020
but I'm not convinced
he's more agile.

33:35.980 --> 33:39.620
Look at that, the Ferrari's
just a great big 700

33:39.620 --> 33:40.980
horsepower drift machine!

33:46.700 --> 33:49.500
The McLaren's different,
it's an accurate car,

33:49.500 --> 33:51.340
this wants to carve up corners.

33:51.340 --> 33:55.220
The whole thing, to me,
feels better connected.

33:57.780 --> 34:01.100
The Ferrari's got the speed,

34:01.100 --> 34:03.380
but I'm getting more entertained
here.

34:05.860 --> 34:11.739
Special car, you don't come
across these very often.

34:11.739 --> 34:13.540
Hasta la vista, baby!

34:20.940 --> 34:24.699
The truth is, there
are no losers here.

34:24.699 --> 34:27.460
Forget the million pound
hypercars,

34:27.460 --> 34:29.699
for sheer driver experience

34:29.699 --> 34:33.820
this is the best McLaren
you can buy right now,

34:33.820 --> 34:36.780
and that is the best Ferrari.

34:36.780 --> 34:38.540
So, which would I have?

34:39.540 --> 34:41.659
Well, the McLaren.

34:41.659 --> 34:44.780
Yeah, it's cheaper than the Ferrari
and it's not as fast,

34:44.780 --> 34:48.139
but this is a proper,
pure driver's car.

34:48.139 --> 34:51.580
And it's the one that I feel
most connected to.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.980
That one there, that is the one.

35:05.980 --> 35:07.180
That is the one.

35:07.180 --> 35:10.540
So, 600LT, LT as we know, stands

35:10.540 --> 35:11.820
for Longtail, explain.

35:11.820 --> 35:15.740
OK, it references McLaren's F1
race cars from Le Mans in the '90s.

35:15.740 --> 35:18.660
They grafted a load of body work
onto the back to make them longer,

35:18.660 --> 35:21.220
to go faster, hence Longtail.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.380
Look, it's a brilliant car, OK?

35:23.380 --> 35:26.500
I know that's 250 grand,
but that's 185,

35:26.500 --> 35:28.100
it's an absolute bargain.

35:28.100 --> 35:32.460
Oh, 185 grand, yeah, it
for nothing that, isn't it?

35:32.460 --> 35:34.580
You're like the Martin Lewis
of cars, aren't you?

35:34.580 --> 35:35.940
Come on.

35:35.940 --> 35:38.540
What we all want to know
is which is the fastest?

35:38.540 --> 35:41.940
So earlier today, we sent The Stig
out on the track to find out.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.380
What'd you reckon, Chris?

35:43.380 --> 35:45.780
I reckon the Ferrari's the fastest,
it's got more power,

35:45.780 --> 35:47.620
more grip, it's a really,
really fast car.

35:47.620 --> 35:50.180
But that's not what it's all about,
but show us the lap times,

35:50.180 --> 35:51.300
come on.

35:51.300 --> 35:53.780
Right, we'll start with
the McLaren, 600 LT.

35:53.780 --> 36:00.940
I can tell you it went around
the track and the 1 minute 15.1.

36:00.940 --> 36:02.500
Yes! Which...

36:06.420 --> 36:09.180
Did you expect higher?
What is up with them?

36:09.180 --> 36:12.940
That's a great result,
great result for Woking.

36:12.940 --> 36:14.260
For Woking?

36:14.260 --> 36:16.660
Well, next up you've got
the Ferrari 488 Pista.

36:16.660 --> 36:18.700
How far are we going
to be going up, Chris?

36:18.700 --> 36:21.500
Oh, we're right up the top here,
in the clouds where I can't reach.

36:21.500 --> 36:23.900
That's where you're doing it, Fred.
You reckon? Yeah.

36:23.900 --> 36:26.860
Well, I can tell you that

36:26.860 --> 36:32.180
the Ferrari went around in
1 minute 12... No way!

36:32.180 --> 36:36.620
.7, which makes it our fastest
ever car,

36:36.620 --> 36:38.380
beating the Porsche 911 GT2 RS.

36:38.380 --> 36:43.140
.7 of a second, that's
an absolute mauling,

36:43.140 --> 36:45.260
that is the new weapon on the block.

36:45.260 --> 36:48.860
All the people who've just rushed
out buying a McLaren

36:48.860 --> 36:51.380
on your advice, are going to feel
very, very silly now.

36:51.380 --> 36:53.500
You're the car
expert here, Chris.

36:53.500 --> 36:56.460
You not here for the eye candy.
It's not all about speed...

36:56.460 --> 36:58.140
What?

36:58.140 --> 37:00.700
That's the discerning choice,
that's a peacock car that's

37:00.700 --> 37:02.780
more of your Paddy McGuinness,
this is more me.

37:02.780 --> 37:06.820
The thinking man's supercar.
Really?

37:06.820 --> 37:09.060
You got a link to do.

37:10.300 --> 37:12.660
The thinking man, he says.

37:12.660 --> 37:14.700
The thinking man.

37:14.700 --> 37:15.980
Priceless.

37:15.980 --> 37:19.300
Right, time to get back to our first
cars in Ethiopia where

37:19.300 --> 37:21.340
you'll remember some genius...

37:21.340 --> 37:23.900
..bought a Porsche Boxster
for less than four grand

37:23.900 --> 37:26.020
which unsurprisingly
had broken down.

37:26.020 --> 37:27.780
He was having a rest, Chris.

37:27.780 --> 37:30.380
We pick up the journey the next
morning still heading east

37:30.380 --> 37:34.540
towards the birthplace of humankind.
Humankind.

37:34.540 --> 37:37.380
He was right the first time.
Correct.

37:50.300 --> 37:54.540
What in the name of God's green
Earth have you done to that Porsche?

37:56.980 --> 38:00.100
I've addressed the issue
of overheating.

38:00.100 --> 38:03.940
It's a bit different,
but they are doing a great job.

38:03.940 --> 38:07.180
That is now a great-looking vehicle,
I reckon you could sell that kit to

38:07.180 --> 38:09.300
people who have bought a Boxter.

38:11.540 --> 38:16.940
So day one in Ethiopia had asked
a few questions of our cars,

38:16.940 --> 38:21.420
but we'd crossed the Semien Mountains
and were now well on our way

38:21.420 --> 38:23.740
to the Afar Triangle.

38:23.740 --> 38:28.540
And let's remember that so far only
one of our cars was yet to give us

38:28.540 --> 38:30.620
any kind of trouble.

38:30.620 --> 38:35.220
Well, the Mini continues to demonstrate
its core brilliance, really.

38:35.220 --> 38:37.820
We're out a bit lower,
so a little bit more power,

38:37.820 --> 38:39.460
chassis feels good.

38:39.460 --> 38:41.460
Oh, it's joyous.

38:41.460 --> 38:44.660
Lads, it's genuinely weird
driving a car I've not driven

38:44.660 --> 38:46.380
for two and a half decades.

38:46.380 --> 38:48.980
Because the muscle
memory is still there,

38:48.980 --> 38:52.700
the thing feels totally familiar,
all the controls exactly

38:52.700 --> 38:53.940
where I remember them.

38:53.940 --> 38:58.020
Honestly, I could drive this thing
with my eyes closed.

38:58.020 --> 39:02.740
Now, there was no way
we were going to let that slide.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.940
And in the time it took to look
up local Ethiopian airstrip

39:05.940 --> 39:09.460
on the Internet, Freddie
had come up with a plan.

39:11.620 --> 39:13.220
You are going to love this.

39:13.220 --> 39:16.580
This is how it works,
you start down there, get up to 40

39:16.580 --> 39:20.220
mile an hour, cruise down the runway
and get as close to the cone

39:20.220 --> 39:23.380
as you possibly can.
Straightforward enough.

39:23.380 --> 39:25.900
Oh, no, Paddy, we're going
to be doing this blindfolded.

39:25.900 --> 39:27.300
Blindfolded? Yeah.

39:27.300 --> 39:29.940
You said that you could
drive your Mini, you're at one

39:29.940 --> 39:31.220
with it, with your eyes shut.

39:31.220 --> 39:32.900
Here's your time
to shine a young man.

39:32.900 --> 39:35.420
Well, you know,
it was a phrase I used. It was.

39:35.420 --> 39:37.700
So how do you know
you're doing 40mph?

39:37.700 --> 39:38.900
Glad you asked.

39:38.900 --> 39:42.020
I've got an app for that.
This will beep.

39:42.020 --> 39:43.460
Confident? No.

39:43.460 --> 39:45.380
No, not really, cos
I've just put a new tyre on.

39:45.380 --> 39:48.100
And I've not had the tracking done,
the balancing might be off.

39:48.100 --> 39:51.540
There's just one other thing, lads.

39:51.540 --> 39:54.860
Feels good.
Whoever loses, wears the jumper.

39:54.860 --> 39:55.940
Go on, then.

39:57.180 --> 39:58.860
Oh, it's wet.

39:58.860 --> 40:01.620
With the next stint
and the chunky knit at stake,

40:01.620 --> 40:02.940
it was game on.

40:02.940 --> 40:06.020
And McGuinness was up first.

40:06.020 --> 40:08.380
Now, you can't see owt, can you?

40:08.380 --> 40:10.020
Come on.

40:10.020 --> 40:11.740
Click me in, son.

40:11.740 --> 40:12.980
What is... Oh, it's you!

40:12.980 --> 40:14.500
It's me.

40:14.500 --> 40:17.540
I felt something wet,
I'm like, "What's that?!"

40:17.540 --> 40:19.980
All right, Paddy,
in your own time, mate.

40:19.980 --> 40:22.780
It's like Bird Box. Get out!
You pulled it up.

40:31.700 --> 40:34.060
It's got to be getting to 40, that.

40:34.060 --> 40:35.100
Oh, Jesus!

40:38.020 --> 40:40.900
What in the name
of God's green Earth?!

40:44.060 --> 40:45.820
Oh, I don't know where I am.

40:45.820 --> 40:48.500
He's lifted his blindfold up,
he's way too close.

40:48.500 --> 40:49.940
He's way too close.

40:49.940 --> 40:52.180
Oh, come on, Paddy,
I'm not having that.

40:52.180 --> 40:54.500
I've got to be near, now.

40:54.500 --> 40:57.180
Oh, I'm just going to take a risk,
I'm going to take a risk.

40:59.100 --> 41:01.140
I'm going to take a risk there.

41:01.140 --> 41:04.260
No, no, no! No chance.

41:04.260 --> 41:05.940
He's basically by the cone!

41:10.860 --> 41:12.620
Oh, my God!

41:12.620 --> 41:16.740
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

41:16.740 --> 41:19.020
Oh, my God!

41:20.500 --> 41:22.780
Ohhhh! Yeah!

41:24.380 --> 41:26.980
Hey, look at that!

41:26.980 --> 41:29.060
Can you see it?

41:30.060 --> 41:31.580
Get in!

41:31.580 --> 41:34.860
Do you think he sounds pleased?
I think he's happy with himself.

41:34.860 --> 41:38.020
Whooo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

41:41.020 --> 41:44.180
Boys, I took a gamble,
I'm not going to lie, lads.

41:44.180 --> 41:46.540
But you're not going
to get nearer than that.

41:46.540 --> 41:50.260
I'm literally about one, two, three
away from the cone.

41:50.260 --> 41:51.620
Absolutely nailed it, boys.

41:51.620 --> 41:54.900
One thing I learned... Can't reach,
can you? I'll come down. Nice one.

41:54.900 --> 41:57.700
Nice one. One thing I learned about
these kind of activities,

41:57.700 --> 41:59.220
if you take your blindfold off,

41:59.220 --> 42:01.340
you can get quite close.
It does help.

42:01.340 --> 42:03.580
Oh, I see! Something happened there,
Paddy, come on.

42:03.580 --> 42:06.140
Oh, I see. We've watched you
literally driving at it...

42:06.140 --> 42:08.500
All right, all right.
..slow down and then go again!

42:08.500 --> 42:09.940
Listen, your go next.

42:09.940 --> 42:12.980
Here, get that wrapped round
your face.

42:12.980 --> 42:14.900
What a winner!

42:14.900 --> 42:18.620
No jumper for McGuinness. Get in!

42:19.740 --> 42:20.780
Yes!

42:23.060 --> 42:24.980
So Paddy had laid down the gauntlet

42:24.980 --> 42:28.380
and the pressure was now
all on Harris and his Mini.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.700
You said you could drive this car
with your eyes shut.

42:30.700 --> 42:32.700
Now's your chance, come on.

42:32.700 --> 42:35.220
Go, go, go!

42:40.500 --> 42:41.820
Where's he going?

42:42.980 --> 42:44.700
Oh, this is horrible.

42:46.860 --> 42:48.820
Oh, he's on the grass!

42:48.820 --> 42:51.380
Oh, yes, oh, lovely.

42:51.380 --> 42:54.820
Go on, keep going, keep going.
Keep going. He's passed it.

42:56.940 --> 42:58.500
I'm stopping there.

43:01.780 --> 43:02.940
Wow.

43:04.900 --> 43:06.420
Literally nowhere near.

43:07.740 --> 43:09.380
Not too bad.

43:09.380 --> 43:10.940
Not great either.

43:10.940 --> 43:13.700
Which meant the door
had been left wide open

43:13.700 --> 43:15.700
for me and the Boxster.

43:15.700 --> 43:17.180
Best of luck to you.

43:17.180 --> 43:18.460
Off you go.

43:19.540 --> 43:20.660
There he goes.

43:20.660 --> 43:22.700
This is horrible.

43:22.700 --> 43:25.100
He's gone wrong immediately!

43:25.100 --> 43:27.220
Come on, nice and straight.

43:27.220 --> 43:28.860
Into third gear.

43:28.860 --> 43:30.780
One, two...

43:30.780 --> 43:32.980
Wow, that's massive to the right.

43:32.980 --> 43:34.740
He's going to hit that
at some speed.

43:39.060 --> 43:41.180
Oh, I'm on the grass!

43:41.180 --> 43:43.620
Where's he going? He's going...

43:45.620 --> 43:49.060
Nine, 10, 11...

43:49.060 --> 43:51.740
I'm on the runway again, 12.

43:51.740 --> 43:53.140
Oh, now, this is worrying.

43:53.140 --> 43:56.220
What'd I do there, I'd stop
if I were him. I'd stop just there.

43:56.220 --> 43:58.220
15. See, I don't know why
I'm counting,

43:58.220 --> 43:59.820
I've not got a clue where I am.

43:59.820 --> 44:01.260
Ooh, he's close.

44:01.260 --> 44:04.260
Maybe a little bit more?
Oh, I don't know!

44:04.260 --> 44:06.780
Be closer than Harris.

44:06.780 --> 44:08.780
Oh...

44:15.300 --> 44:17.180
Get in, Harris.

44:17.180 --> 44:19.300
Oh, oh...

44:19.300 --> 44:21.340
Someone's wearing the jumper.

44:22.420 --> 44:24.300
Someone's wearing the jumper.

44:24.300 --> 44:25.780
You're going to be hot, Chris.

44:25.780 --> 44:28.380
You're going to be
very, very hot, Christopher.

44:40.780 --> 44:44.580
I'm not going to lie, boys,
it's good to be back in front.

44:44.580 --> 44:46.140
Well done, Paddy.

44:46.140 --> 44:47.300
Thanks, Fred.

44:47.300 --> 44:50.860
I've got to say, those fans look
good on the front of the car, pal.

44:50.860 --> 44:52.980
I'm really pleased with them, Paddy.

44:52.980 --> 44:55.140
I think it adds something
to the car.

44:55.140 --> 44:56.380
Looks better.

44:56.380 --> 45:00.180
How's that jumper, Chris, at the
back? Is it as warm as I remember?

45:01.780 --> 45:04.660
Oh, Fred, I think
you were so good in that one,

45:04.660 --> 45:06.220
oh, I think the Boxster's wonderful.

45:06.220 --> 45:08.780
Oh, Paddy,
I think you were so magnificent

45:08.780 --> 45:11.700
the way that you cheated
in that last competition.

45:12.780 --> 45:13.940
Oh, dear.

45:15.260 --> 45:18.540
And to think, with the day
still warming up,

45:18.540 --> 45:21.820
the chunky knit
was only getting hotter.

45:21.820 --> 45:24.900
It smells like
a marathon runner's ballbag.

45:24.900 --> 45:28.140
By midday, the mini in the Mini
had had enough.

45:28.140 --> 45:32.020
Lads, any chance we can stop
and get a drink, please?

45:37.740 --> 45:39.300
No!

45:39.300 --> 45:41.100
These lads are good, aren't they?

45:41.100 --> 45:42.740
You play a bit of this?

45:42.740 --> 45:44.180
I've dabbled a bit.

45:44.180 --> 45:45.580
Back in the day at the youth club.

45:45.580 --> 45:47.820
Do you want a game?
What are you doing?

45:47.820 --> 45:50.380
What are you doing?
Come on, do us proud.

45:50.380 --> 45:53.500
Let me... I'm going to... I'm just
going to nip for a wee first.

45:53.500 --> 45:54.780
I'm just going to nip for a wee.

45:54.780 --> 45:56.580
I've just teed you up with a game.
Come on!

45:56.580 --> 45:58.980
Quick wee and I'll be back.
I'm not playing with him.

46:09.300 --> 46:11.780
Right, boys, I'm back.
Oh, my word.

46:11.780 --> 46:13.620
Step aside, sunshine.

46:13.620 --> 46:15.100
Oh, wow.

46:15.100 --> 46:18.780
I've got full 17-year-old
driving test attire on.

46:18.780 --> 46:19.900
What are you doing?

46:19.900 --> 46:21.780
Don't be intimidated, boys.

46:21.780 --> 46:24.020
First to ten. Let's go.

46:24.020 --> 46:26.500
Hit it, Paddy!
I just did, you clown.

46:26.500 --> 46:28.140
Do something in midfield.

46:29.860 --> 46:31.900
You can't dress like this
and be this bad.

46:33.260 --> 46:34.740
Look at this. This is silky now.

46:34.740 --> 46:36.820
Oh, the pressure!

46:40.180 --> 46:42.540
Ohhhh! Teamwork!

46:42.540 --> 46:44.540
Yeah, nine-all!

46:44.540 --> 46:46.220
9-9, this is it!

46:46.220 --> 46:48.900
9-9!

46:48.900 --> 46:50.420
Go on, Fred! Go on, Fred!

46:55.580 --> 46:57.060
It's like Italia '90.

46:59.380 --> 47:02.060
Thanks very much, thank you.
Cheers, Bob.

47:04.900 --> 47:07.260
Oh, boys, I've got to tell you,
I feel alive.

47:07.260 --> 47:09.060
It brings it all back to me, this.

47:09.060 --> 47:12.980
Late '80s, early '90s,
got the blue shorts back on,

47:12.980 --> 47:16.740
got my Juventus top back on,
driving my MK2 Escort.

47:16.740 --> 47:20.540
Everything about this car
is fantastic.

47:20.540 --> 47:24.820
Ford really did break the mould
with the MK2.

47:24.820 --> 47:28.500
In fact, there's only one thing
they got wrong with it.

47:28.500 --> 47:31.340
It would be the name they gave it
when they developed it.

47:31.340 --> 47:36.580
I mean, the Ford Mustang, codename
for that was Project Falcon.

47:36.580 --> 47:38.020
Sounds good.

47:38.020 --> 47:41.980
The GT - Project Phoenix.

47:41.980 --> 47:43.340
Cool.

47:43.340 --> 47:48.660
The Ford Escort MK2,
Project Brenda.

47:50.660 --> 47:51.900
Brenda?

47:56.300 --> 48:00.900
Whatever her name was, though,
the Escort was in for a treat.

48:00.900 --> 48:02.900
Oh, what a road!

48:04.340 --> 48:06.140
Oh, my word!

48:06.140 --> 48:08.580
Come on, Paddy. Open her up.

48:08.580 --> 48:10.420
Get a wriggle on, boy.

48:17.460 --> 48:19.820
Whoohoo! This is a lot of fun.

48:21.580 --> 48:23.740
Oh, fully airborne in the Mini!

48:25.180 --> 48:31.180
Tell you what, this is what the Boxster
was designed for, perfect tarmac.

48:31.180 --> 48:33.980
Whoa! And there's goats! Be careful!

48:33.980 --> 48:36.260
Don't get them on the Col de Turini.

48:40.100 --> 48:41.380
Geez!

48:45.740 --> 48:48.620
Life's good, life is very good.

48:50.060 --> 48:51.180
Man alive!

48:51.180 --> 48:54.140
What a day it's been.

48:59.540 --> 49:01.220
I rather like Ethiopia.

49:04.860 --> 49:06.180
I love this place.

49:09.020 --> 49:10.900
It just gets better
and better and better,

49:10.900 --> 49:12.380
the more you travel through it.

49:15.340 --> 49:19.300
It has a sense of calm about it
that I've not experienced before.

49:19.300 --> 49:22.820
Maybe that's because
it is the most ancient place

49:22.820 --> 49:24.740
where human beings
have lived on the planet,

49:24.740 --> 49:26.860
I don't know,
but there's a calmness to it.

49:28.500 --> 49:30.940
The landscape is utterly stunning.

49:34.100 --> 49:35.780
It's joyous.

49:47.260 --> 49:50.380
I just had a thought in my head
that I find it very difficult

49:50.380 --> 49:53.420
to associate
what we've seen of this country

49:53.420 --> 49:56.220
with that appalling famine
30 years ago.

49:56.220 --> 49:57.700
I just can't believe it happened,

49:57.700 --> 50:00.780
because it doesn't feel like the
kind of place where it has happened.

50:03.380 --> 50:05.380
Go on, lads!

50:05.380 --> 50:08.780
I don't know what I expected
when I came here,

50:08.780 --> 50:11.060
but I didn't expect this.

50:14.060 --> 50:16.820
Today, the Boxster
has done me proud.

50:20.260 --> 50:24.980
I'd even go so far as to say
this has been my best day

50:24.980 --> 50:26.900
in a Porsche Boxster ever.

50:28.820 --> 50:30.260
Thank you, Ethiopia.

50:32.220 --> 50:33.460
Thank you.

50:38.020 --> 50:41.300
But Ethiopia
wasn't finished with us yet.

50:43.940 --> 50:46.180
The next morning, we were closing in

50:46.180 --> 50:49.300
on the vast desert
of the Afar Triangle.

50:49.300 --> 50:54.260
Our destination was within reach
but the terrain was getting tougher.

50:56.740 --> 50:58.020
Look at that!

50:58.020 --> 50:59.540
What's happened to the road?

51:00.580 --> 51:02.820
Even the safety wall's
given up there.

51:08.220 --> 51:09.660
Oh!

51:09.660 --> 51:11.820
Big ones here, lads, big ones.

51:12.860 --> 51:15.460
As we kept winding downhill, though,

51:15.460 --> 51:17.460
the air was getting thicker

51:17.460 --> 51:20.100
and, frankly,
the risk of being wiped out by

51:20.100 --> 51:21.980
a landslide was nothing...

51:23.220 --> 51:25.620
..compared to the relentless heat.

51:27.100 --> 51:30.620
Oh, even with this wind here,
even the wind is hot.

51:34.180 --> 51:36.180
Boys, I've just had a bit of a...

51:36.180 --> 51:38.340
I got very, very hot,
very quickly then.

51:38.340 --> 51:39.540
I'm about to chunder.

51:39.540 --> 51:42.460
Have you got anything
with sugar in it?

51:42.460 --> 51:44.900
Sounds a bit disconcerting.

51:44.900 --> 51:46.660
Is that jumper
getting to you, Chris?

51:54.460 --> 51:56.500
Oh... You all right?

52:01.820 --> 52:07.220
I wasn't all right. And with the
mercury rising towards 40 degrees,

52:07.220 --> 52:10.700
a little further down the road,
it soon became clear

52:10.700 --> 52:14.420
that things were only
going to get worse.

52:14.420 --> 52:16.300
Boys, boys, stop, stop, stop.

52:16.300 --> 52:17.860
Road's run out.

52:17.860 --> 52:19.220
Stop.

52:21.660 --> 52:22.780
Challenge.

52:24.660 --> 52:26.020
It's baking!

52:26.020 --> 52:28.180
What have you got, Paddy?

52:29.340 --> 52:30.460
"Congratulations.

52:30.460 --> 52:33.180
"You have reached the edge
of the Afar Triangle,

52:33.180 --> 52:35.700
"birthplace of humankind.

52:35.700 --> 52:39.300
"It's now time to find out
how good your first cars really are

52:39.300 --> 52:44.220
"by crossing the Danakil Depression
to the sulphur pools at Dallol,

52:44.220 --> 52:48.100
"the hottest and most
inhospitable place on Earth."

52:48.100 --> 52:49.380
So it's going to get hotter?

52:49.380 --> 52:52.180
It's going to get hotter?
It's going to get hotter.

52:52.180 --> 52:55.500
"Good luck.
You and your cars will need it."

52:59.500 --> 53:01.140
Um, I don't feel well.

53:01.140 --> 53:02.620
I feel badly dehydrated.

53:02.620 --> 53:04.940
I've definitely got heatstroke now.

53:06.540 --> 53:08.260
Oh, and they've gone without me.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.340
Ugh...

53:19.820 --> 53:21.060
Right, let's get a move on.

53:21.060 --> 53:22.780
Lads, I've got to get
a bit of a move on here.

53:22.780 --> 53:25.460
Do you want to open it up a bit,
get some air in the car?

53:27.660 --> 53:29.460
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

53:31.060 --> 53:32.580
This is more like it.

53:32.580 --> 53:36.060
Oh! Oh, maybe not.

53:38.780 --> 53:40.100
You dickhead!

53:40.100 --> 53:41.740
You absolute whopper!

53:44.020 --> 53:46.460
If I was you,
I'd get back in your car.

53:46.460 --> 53:48.780
You braked!
Because there was a big lump.

53:48.780 --> 53:50.940
You braked!
You saw I was right behind you.

53:50.940 --> 53:55.740
How, in the Afar Triangle,

53:55.740 --> 54:00.300
barren,
you can't see anything for miles,

54:00.300 --> 54:04.700
do you crash a Mini
into a Porsche Boxster?

54:04.700 --> 54:07.060
Never mind the start of life,
I'm going to wipe one out.

54:12.060 --> 54:14.420
Whoa, Chris, stop the car!

54:14.420 --> 54:16.980
The heat was starting
to get to all of us.

54:16.980 --> 54:18.980
Absolute bellends.

54:18.980 --> 54:22.420
And since driving fast to keep us
cool hadn't worked...

54:22.420 --> 54:24.300
40 degrees!

54:24.300 --> 54:26.060
..I resorted to Plan B.

54:26.060 --> 54:29.780
Lads, lads, I'm going to try
and get this roof off.

54:40.220 --> 54:42.580
Oh, God, that's...
That's just warm water.

54:44.140 --> 54:46.460
Just poured warm water
all over myself.

54:49.860 --> 54:52.100
Now we were properly
up and running...

54:52.100 --> 54:54.740
Oh, I'm happy.

54:54.740 --> 54:56.380
I can feel the air.

54:56.380 --> 54:59.380
Tiger, the Boxster Tiger.

54:59.380 --> 55:04.220
But then, immediately,
the desert had other ideas.

55:04.220 --> 55:07.220
This is hard, hard going.

55:07.220 --> 55:08.700
And before long...

55:09.820 --> 55:11.100
Are you all right, Harris?

55:11.100 --> 55:13.180
..we'd stopped again.

55:22.220 --> 55:23.380
Right, what's up?

55:23.380 --> 55:26.060
The engine, and the clutch.

55:26.060 --> 55:28.260
It won't start and it won't idle.

55:28.260 --> 55:31.020
The suspension's completely rooted.
It's smashed to bits.

55:31.020 --> 55:33.620
All right. You've pointed it
all out. What can we do to help?

55:33.620 --> 55:34.900
Let's not think of problems,

55:34.900 --> 55:36.740
let's think of solutions.
What can we do?

55:36.740 --> 55:38.820
I tell you what will fix the car
immediately

55:38.820 --> 55:40.780
is if the driver
can take off the jumper.

55:40.780 --> 55:43.780
No. No, no, no. No, no, no, Chris.

55:43.780 --> 55:45.180
That's not happening.

55:45.180 --> 55:47.900
And, do you know what,
you're letting yourself down

55:47.900 --> 55:49.580
by even thinking that way.

55:49.580 --> 55:51.340
Don't take it off!

55:51.340 --> 55:53.780
And then, when we get to
the end of the Afar Triangle,

55:53.780 --> 55:56.180
wherever that is, you can
take it off then

55:56.180 --> 55:59.500
and you'll feel good about yourself,
you've achieved something.

55:59.500 --> 56:02.020
Look yourself in the mirror tonight,
if you get a step.

56:02.020 --> 56:03.220
You'll be all right.

56:03.220 --> 56:04.980
Now get in the Mini.
Come on, son.

56:04.980 --> 56:07.980
Let's get out there. Chris, Chris!

56:07.980 --> 56:11.540
And, as well, this...
We've let this one slide.

56:11.540 --> 56:14.140
You've got the sleeves up.
He didn't.

56:16.100 --> 56:19.660
Better. Better. This is better.

56:19.660 --> 56:20.860
This is better now.

56:20.860 --> 56:22.540
You feel better, don't you?

56:22.540 --> 56:23.780
You feel better.

56:23.780 --> 56:26.340
Get yourself in, go on.
Get yourself in.

56:26.340 --> 56:27.940
Good lad. Go on, Harris.

56:30.220 --> 56:31.580
To glory!

56:35.260 --> 56:37.780
But, unfortunately,

56:37.780 --> 56:40.900
glory was on the other side of this.

56:42.340 --> 56:45.860
The vast salt plains
of the Danakil desert.

56:47.660 --> 56:51.340
Mile after mile
of car-killing punishment.

56:55.340 --> 56:57.700
Jesus wept!

56:57.700 --> 57:00.140
Oh, no, no, no, no.

57:00.140 --> 57:02.220
No, no, no, no, no, no.

57:02.220 --> 57:05.020
Oh, listen to it, listen to it!

57:06.180 --> 57:09.060
I am literally
praying for this to end.

57:10.340 --> 57:12.580
It just goes on and on and on.

57:13.940 --> 57:15.580
Oh!

57:15.580 --> 57:17.140
There's something going on now.

57:17.140 --> 57:18.860
I think the fan's come off.

57:18.860 --> 57:20.700
Oh, my word. I'm not even steering.

57:20.700 --> 57:23.780
Chris, can you see what's happening
on my car at the front?

57:23.780 --> 57:26.780
It's making some weird noises.
Is that the fan?

57:26.780 --> 57:29.620
Fred, I'm afraid I've got
my own problems at the moment.

57:32.740 --> 57:34.980
We've got to keep moving!

57:38.980 --> 57:41.340
Oh, come on, Escort.

57:41.340 --> 57:43.260
I've got to tell you, though...

57:44.580 --> 57:50.700
..this little 1600 rear-wheel drive
monster of a car

57:50.700 --> 57:52.500
is handling it!

57:52.500 --> 57:56.380
I wouldn't say no problem,
but it's doing the do.

58:01.140 --> 58:04.700
Actually,
I think it's getting better.

58:06.220 --> 58:09.780
Come on, little Mini. Come on.

58:09.780 --> 58:11.380
It's flattening out, lads.

58:11.380 --> 58:13.060
It's flattening out.

58:13.060 --> 58:14.700
Come on.

58:14.700 --> 58:16.900
Keep trucking, Boxster.

58:16.900 --> 58:18.620
And then...

58:18.620 --> 58:22.180
We're out the rough, boys!
We're out the rough!

58:22.180 --> 58:24.540
Keep going, Chris! Keep going!

58:27.500 --> 58:29.660
Oh, yes! Yes!

58:31.500 --> 58:33.700
Now we're rolling.

58:33.700 --> 58:35.380
She's singing!

58:35.380 --> 58:37.340
What a wicked little car.

58:38.740 --> 58:42.460
Oh, here he comes.
Here comes the Boxster!

58:43.740 --> 58:46.540
Oh, here he comes!

58:53.660 --> 58:55.140
Good to have you back, Chris.

58:55.140 --> 58:58.940
Against the odds, we'd all made it.

58:58.940 --> 59:00.900
The finish line.

59:00.900 --> 59:02.700
Lead us in, son.

59:08.300 --> 59:09.740
Come on, boys!

59:16.060 --> 59:17.500
Whoohoo!

59:29.460 --> 59:31.980
We made it, boys!

59:31.980 --> 59:33.700
Who'd have thought?

59:33.700 --> 59:35.020
Chris Harris...

59:35.020 --> 59:36.580
You did it, Harris!

59:36.580 --> 59:37.780
Come here, you.

59:37.780 --> 59:39.460
You little superstar.

59:39.460 --> 59:42.620
Eh? Never thought you were
getting through. But...

59:42.620 --> 59:45.940
Come on. We did it, boys!
We did it!

59:45.940 --> 59:48.580
We did it! We did it!

59:50.180 --> 59:54.420
This was it,
the heart of the Danakil.

59:57.620 --> 01:00:00.420
Bought for just a few thousand
pounds,

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:04.340
our first cars had journeyed to
the cradle of humankind

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:08.820
and then withstood one of the most
hostile environments on Earth.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.540
But more than that,
through trials and triumphs,

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:17.340
they'd taken us back to
that first thrill of driving.

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:28.660
That wonder of the open road,

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:30.740
and where it might take you.

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:33.020
Oh, my word.

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.500
Can I take the jumper off now?

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.860
No. No.

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:59.060
First off, Ethiopia, what a place!

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.940
Truly, truly beautiful.

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:02.620
Stunning scenery, spoiled only

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:04.860
by bits of
Freddie's Porsche everywhere.

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:09.780
Anyhow, gents, we have to decide
which of us bought the best car, OK?

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:12.300
Yeah, true, that's true.
I can't believe I'm saying this,

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.740
but we have to agree that
one of these cars was standout,

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:17.460
better than the others, wasn't it,
and it was that flipping Escort?

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:20.020
I don't want to say it, Chris,
but I have to give it to him.

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:22.340
Yes! Thank you. It was so good.

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:23.780
And I pulled, everyone.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.140
I pulled a Porsche!

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.500
Can you believe it?

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:31.700
I pulled a Porsche. Credit where
it's due, credit where it's due.

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:34.100
Genuinely, it is a great car.

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.020
It's the greatest car of the three

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.380
and if you can remember which side
of the road to drive on,

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:41.700
you might, one day, you might make
a decent Top Gear host.

01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:45.260
Just one thing before we go,

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:49.620
Paddy never got the chance in
Ethiopia to wear the chunky knit.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:52.340
So... Thank you. No, no.
So I've got...

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:55.820
No. I can smell it!
..the stinky chunky jumper. No, no.

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:58.060
No, no!

01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:01.020
Right! That's all
we've got time for tonight.

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:04.060
We're back next week
with an electric car collection

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:06.980
and our guests will be
Danny Boyle and Himesh Patel.

01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.500
Thanks for watching, goodnight!
