00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
THIS IS ONE OF THEIR STORIES.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
REALLY WAS MY FAULT.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
JUST FINISHED UP WITH THE
CLERK.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
HE'S SHOOK UP BUT OKAY.

TILL THE WAR IS WON

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
FAULT, GRANDDAD.

00:20.000 --> 00:20.000
IF WE DIE, I AIN'T NEVER GONNA

DAMN, THAT IS SEXY.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000

THERE'S ONLY ONE 19-YEAR-OLD
BLACK MALE THAT MATCHES THAT

WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000

PRETTY BOY FLIZZY.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
AFFLUENT, QUIET, TREE-LINED SUBURB.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
>> Riley: FIRST THING YOU NEED

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
UM, ONLY THE HOTTEST
UP-AND-COMING R&B STAR!

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
TO DO IS GET SOME CLOTHES ON.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
HERE IS WHERE ROBERT JEBEDIAH FREEMAN, WAR

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
YOU'VE HEARD OF HIS SONGS --
"TITTY TELETHON"?

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
HERO AND CIVIL-RIGHTS LEGEND, DECIDED TO SPEND HIS FINAL

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
DAYS.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
ALL RIGHT, THINK.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
HOW WOULD I HAVE HEARD THIS?

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
BUT THINGS DIDN'T QUITE WORK OUT AS PLANNED.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
WE GOT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
OKAY, I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD,
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH!"

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
GONNA DO.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
HUEY, WHAT DO WE DO?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
ALL DAY LONG ON THE RADIO,
THAT'S ALL I HEAR, EVEN ON THE

Granddad: BOYS!

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Huey: WE'RE RIGHT HERE,
GRANDDAD.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
WHITE STATIONS.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
>> Granddad: WHAT HOME?

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
NO, I HAVEN'T HEARD
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH!"

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Granddad: IMPORTANT FAMILY
ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
WE HAVE NO HOME.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
WE ARE LEAVING WOODCREST
FOREVER.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
WE HAVE NO FUTURE.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
OUR LIVES HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE
DISASTER SINCE WE MOVED HERE.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
WE HAVE NOTHING!

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
EH, IT'S NOT MY THING, BUT
IT'S WHAT PASSES FOR R&B NOW,

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
ALL RIGHT?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Riley: TRUE THAT. TRUE THAT.

00:59.000 --> 00:59.000
WHAT CAN I SAY?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Huey: NOW, THAT'S TRUE,
GRANDDAD.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I GOT TEENAGE DAUGHTERS.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Granddad: WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
HAVE SAFE, BORING LIVES.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
THEY'RE INTO BLACK GUYS, SO THIS
IS WHAT I GOT TO HEAR.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GOOD OLD
DAYS WHEN BLACK SINGERS WOULD

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
I WAS SUPPOSED TO FIND SOME HOT,
FINANCIALLY DESPERATE OR

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
DRESS IN HIGH-HEEL BOOTS OR BURN
HOOKERS WITH CRACK PIPES?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
SEXUALLY FRUSTRATED MAMA AND
SETTLE DOWN.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
BUT NOTHING WORKED OUT AS
PLANNED.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
YOU'RE SHOWING YOUR AGE, MY
FRIEND.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
FLIZZY'S IN TOWN, DOING A SHOW
AT WOODCREST POST PAVILION

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
IT'S JUST BEEN ONE RIDICULOUS,
STUPID, BIZARRE EPISODE AFTER

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I WAS HOPING TO GO.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
NOW I HAVE AN EXCUSE.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
I'M TAKING RESPONSIBILITY.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
>> Huey: GRANDDAD, COME ON.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Riley: WELL, I SAY IT'S ABOUT
TIME!

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
END OF THE ROAD FOR ME.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
I BEEN SAYIN' THIS PLACE SUCKS

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
INSPIRATION THAT MADE LADY SING

01:24.000 --> 01:24.000
WE'RE LEAVING.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Huey: WAIT A MINUTE,
GRANDDAD.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
I'M NOT COMING.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
I'M GOING TO STAND IN THE MIDDLE

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
OF THE ROAD IN MY DRAWERS WITH

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000

MR. RUCKUS, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
WELL, YOU SEE, TO BE HONEST, I'M

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Ruckus: GET OFF ME, ROBERT!

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
GET YOUR NIGGA HANDS OFF ME!

06:13.000 --> 06:23.000
OH, WHAT A SURPRISE -- THE

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
HELLO?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
HELLO?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Tom: I REALLY DON'T THINK
IT'S PRUDENT TO RECORD AN

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
I'M NOT RECORDING.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
ALWAYS HAD A HARD TIME WITH

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
THIS IS A LIVE STREAM.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
ED WUNCLER AND I ARE OLD BUDDIES
NOW.

06:26.000 --> 06:26.000
WOMEN.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I'M NOT VERY FIT.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
WHAT'S UP?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
HE'LL FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT
WORK, RIGHT?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Y'ALL KNOW WHO IT IS --
PRETTY BEEZY FLEE-YEEZEY-WEEZY,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I'M NOT VERY FUNNY.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
I'M NOT PARTICULARLY GOOD AT

I APPRECIATE ALL THE LOVE AND
SUPPORT Y'ALL BEEN SENDING ME

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
LORD KNOWS I'M NOT GOOD IN BED.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
SINCE THE WHOLE INCIDENT WENT
DOWN.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
NEVER FEAR.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Riley: I HOPE THAT'S THAT

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
BUT I HAD MONEY, AND AS LONG AS

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
GOT BIG LAWYERS ON THE CASE.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
SAY WHAT'S UP TO TOM DuBOIS.

06:36.000 --> 06:43.000
SHOW THAT BUILDS HOUSES FOR POOR
PEOPLE.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
I HAD MONEY, I COULD HAVE A

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
MODERATELY SATISFYING SEX LIFE.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Tom: FLIZZY, I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO TURN IT OFF, NOW.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
>> Riley: UGH.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
KILL THE CAMERA, B.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Tom: I ALSO THINK THESE
PEOPLE SHOULD LEAVE.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
FREEMAN.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
"THESE PEOPLE?"
YOU MEAN "THESE PEOPLE?"

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Tom: I MEAN THESE PEOPLE.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000

Granddad: OH. HUH?

YEAH, WE NEVER MET, BUT MY
FATHER TALKS ABOUT YOU SO MUCH,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
ANYTHING YOU CAN SAY TO ME YOU

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
IF ANYTHING, NIGGA, YOU THE
STRANGER HERE.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
I FEEL LIKE I KNOW YOU.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
DAD TURNED OVER THE PROPERTY
MANAGEMENT TO ME.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
YOU SHOULD LEAVE THE ROOM.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Tom: IT'S MY OFFICE.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
OKAY, THEN, SO WHAT'S THE BIG
SECRET THAT YOU CAN'T

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Granddad: WELL, UH...IT'S A
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU,

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
MATTER OF FACT, WHY AM I EVEN
HERE?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
MR. WUNCLER THE SECOND.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Tom: YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT YOUR CRIMINAL CASE.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
CALL ME EDDIE.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
CAN I COME IN?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
OH, THAT'S RIGHT!

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Tom: I REVIEWED THE CASE, AND
I'VE WATCHED THE SECURITY

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Tom: DID YOU ROB THE LIQUOR
STORE, FLIZZY?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
WELL, DID YOU TRY IT?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000

WE'RE GONNA BE

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000

Tom: DON'T GET TOO EXCITED.

08:54.000 --> 08:54.000
GOT TO RUN.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
IT'S ALL GONNA BE OKAY.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING BOMBS FOR?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
I'M NOT TAKING THE CASE.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Tom: I GUESS HITTING A WOMAN
IS OKAY IF YOU HAVE ABS,

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Nothing is going to be okay.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Listen to me.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000

Sarah: OUR PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN
ROUGH ON HER.

A SEPARATE UNIT -- TWO BEDROOMS,

10:26.000 --> 10:26.000
Tom: WELL, IT'S NOT YOU.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
We need to get up out of here,

SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
THEY HATE TO BE BORED.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
EDDIE WUNCLER'S THE OWNER OF
THIS HOUSE

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
THIS STUFF.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
A WOMAN WOULD RATHER BE WITH A
GUY THAT BEATS THEM TO DEATH

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Granddad: I WAS HOPING TO USE

IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TELL

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Granddad: YES, BUT I WOULD
PREFER TO U--

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
>> Granddad: YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
WHAT IS THE SECRET TO MY
SEXINESS?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
STAND YOU.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
STUFF IS DANGEROUS.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
ARE WE ABOUT TO HAVE A NIGGA
MOMENT?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
IT'S A HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
COMPOUND.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
ABSOLUTELY.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
ARE WE ABOUT TO HAVE A NIGGA
MOMENT?!

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
IT'S A HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
BUT, REALLY, IT'S BECAUSE I'M A

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Granddad: NO, PLEASE.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
>> Granddad: DAMN IT, BOY.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
I DON'T WANNA HAVE A NIGGA
MOMENT.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
I'M GONNA BEAT YOUR ASS WHEN WE

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I JUST HAVE TO GO TO THE
BATHROOM.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
THAT'S WHAT ALL WOMEN WANT.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
EXPLOSIVE?

12:09.000 --> 12:09.000
Tom: WHY?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
YOU THINK THEM BITCHES OUT THERE

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
BECAUSE WOMEN HAVE NO
SELF-RESPECT!

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
CARE ABOUT A LITTLE FIRE?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Tom: WELL, MY WIFE HAS

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
THIS HERE WILL TURN YOUR BRAIN

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
SELF-RESPECT.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
GREEN.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
REALLY? YOU SURE?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
THIS STUFF HAS PLUTONIUM.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Tom: YES!

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
SHE'S AN EDUCATED, WELL-ROUNDED,
CONFIDENT WOMAN.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
THIS ONE HERE IS ACID.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
THAT'S IT!

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
JUST ACID.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I MAY NEED TO MEET HER.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
HE RENTED MY BATHROOM!

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Tom: NO, NO, NO. NO.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
OH, THAT'S THE WHOLE HOUSE.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
DON'T YOU GET IT?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I KNOW WHERE THIS GOES.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
A MAN CAN'T TRULY CALL HIMSELF A
MAN ONCE A STRANGER'S ASS CHEEKS

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
THESE BITCHES WOULD PUT NAPALM

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO MY WIFE.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
ON THEIR HAIR IF IT WOULD MAKE

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
DO YOUR WIFE?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
IT STRAIGHT.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
TOM, I WOULDN'T DO YOUR WIFE.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
PUT A WARNING LABEL ON IT.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Tom: YOU HAVE A SONG CALLED
"I WILL DO YOUR WIFE!"

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Riley: THIS ALL YOUR FAULT,
GRANDDAD.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
YOU REALLY TURNED OUR LIFE INTO
"GOOD TIMES."

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I DIDN'T MEAN  YOUR  WIFE!

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Granddad: OUR LIFE IS NOT
"GOOD TIMES."

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I MEANT THAT METAPHORICALLY.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
WE STILL LIVE IN A NICE
NEIGHBORHOOD.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Riley: YEAH, FOR NOW.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Tom: MM, I STILL DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Huey: YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GET A
JOB, GRANDDAD.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
NIGGA, I SWEAR ON MY ABS --
ON MY ABS, NIGGA! -- I WILL NOT

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Granddad: WHY DO  I  HAVE TO
GET A JOB?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
WHY CAN'T Y'ALL GET JOBS?

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Huey: CHILD LABOR LAWS,
UNSAFE WORKPLACES, REALLY SMALL

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
TOUCH YOUR WIFE.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Tom: WELL, MY DAUGHTER WOULD
LOVE TO MEET YOU.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
HANDS.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000

12:45.000 --> 12:45.000
Granddad: THAT'S GARBAGE!

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
YOUR GENERATION IS JUST LAZY,
THAT'S ALL.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
NO ENTOURAGE!

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
NO PROBLEM.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
PLUS, WHO'S EVEN HIRING NOW?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Ruckus: I DIDN'T GIVE UP
WORK.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Tom: WELL, MAYBE IF YOU

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
HOW THEY LINE UP FOR THIS

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000

AND START WAXING HOODS.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
OKAY, SO, CHECK IT.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
KEY WITH CHICKS IS TO INSULT

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
WAX ON, WAX OFF, NIGGA!

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000

Tom: WHAT ELSE WAS FAKE?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
THEN A PINCH AND A SPLASH.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
WERE THE NICARAGUAN GUNS FAKE?

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
OR IS IT A SPLASH, THEN A PINCH

DID YOU REALLY EVEN BEAT

Granddad: SLAVERY?!

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
YOU GOT TO ACT LIKE AN IDIOT
JUST TO STAY IN THEIR

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
FACES!

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
BUT IF I CAN STAY IN JUST THE
RIGHT AMOUNT OF TROUBLE, I'LL BE

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT AS
"SLAVERY."

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
>> Huey: GRANDDAD!

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I THINK ABOUT IT AS INVESTING IN
PEOPLE.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

19:50.000 --> 19:50.000

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
IT BETTER NOT BE NOTHIN' GAY.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
IF WE DIE, I AIN'T NEVER GONNA

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
NO.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
FORGIVE YOU.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
I DON'T LIVE IN YOUR WORLD.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
IT JUST MEANS YOU GET TO LIVE IN
100% OF THE HOUSE 100% OF THE

I'M A SIMPLE GUY.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
I JUST WANT TO DO MY JOB, TAKE
CARE OF MY FAMILY, AND I NEEDED

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
TIME, AND, IN EXCHANGE...

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
SOME HELP TRYING TO GET MY WIFE

Huey: YOU OWN US.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
AAH!

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
NO, I JUST OWN 100% OF YOUR
TIME UNTIL THE DEBT IS PAID.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
OH, YOU WANT YOUR WIFE BACK?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
THAT'S FAIR, RIGHT?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
HOW ABOUT NOT INVITING A NIGGA
THAT'S RICHER THAN YOU AND

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Huey: NO!

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
SURE, IT IS.

FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY I COME BY
UNANNOUNCED, IN THE MIDDLE OF

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I'M TIRED OF YOUR PUNK-ASS!

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
