00:07.529 --> 00:10.358
<i>We created a portal inside
a building in 10,000 B.C.</i>

00:10.358 --> 00:12.012
And as long as that portal
remains open,

00:12.012 --> 00:14.057
these sinkholes will continue
to randomly generate.

00:15.450 --> 00:16.929
<i>I'm gonna do
whatever I have to,</i>

00:16.929 --> 00:18.714
to win you back.

00:18.714 --> 00:19.715
<i>I love your father,</i>

00:19.715 --> 00:21.891
but I love Levi.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.502
<i>As hard as it is,</i>

00:24.502 --> 00:26.026
sooner or later, you're gonna
have to make a choice.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.332
I was married before.

00:28.332 --> 00:30.552
<i>I'm finally ready to be
happy with you.</i>

00:30.552 --> 00:32.945
- Who is that?
- My husband.

00:32.945 --> 00:35.905
He and his followers,
they'll come for all of us.

00:37.863 --> 00:39.691
<i>These are the exact same
burns that were on Eddie.</i>

00:40.823 --> 00:42.042
<i>You wanna prove
yourself to me?</i>

00:42.042 --> 00:43.652
Let us use that portal.

00:43.652 --> 00:44.609
Let's go get Josh.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.135
- Josh!
- Riley!

00:48.135 --> 00:49.179
Dad?

00:49.179 --> 00:50.485
Another sinkhole's coming.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.791
But this one we might
be able to stop.

00:56.404 --> 00:58.232
<i>Just over an hour ago,</i>

00:58.232 --> 01:01.148
<i>a 4.6 earthquake struck
in Los Angeles.</i>

01:01.148 --> 01:03.889
<i>Seismologists report
the epicenter was 10 miles</i>

01:03.889 --> 01:05.413
<i>off the coast of Santa Monica.</i>

01:05.413 --> 01:06.805
<i>No casualties were reported,</i>

01:06.805 --> 01:09.634
<i>and infrastructure
damage was minimal.</i>

01:17.773 --> 01:19.688
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:21.603 --> 01:23.213
Gavin, listen.

01:23.213 --> 01:24.954
We finally got
the family back together.

01:24.954 --> 01:26.651
That's no small feat.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.871
Yeah. Yeah.

01:28.871 --> 01:31.221
We're gonna find your mom.

01:31.221 --> 01:33.005
And we'll figure out
the next step.

01:33.005 --> 01:35.921
You're right. Yeah.

01:35.921 --> 01:37.880
Besides, we can't let
a tidal wave destroy

01:37.880 --> 01:39.534
where we had our first date.

01:39.534 --> 01:40.926
No.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.537
No, we cannot.

01:43.929 --> 01:47.107
You remember being on top
of that Ferris wheel?

01:47.107 --> 01:48.543
We were stuck up there awhile.

01:48.543 --> 01:50.153
Almost like you planned it.

01:53.983 --> 01:56.072
I needed the time
to get to know you better.

01:56.072 --> 01:58.118
Hey.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.380
I got something.

02:00.990 --> 02:02.470
It's a simple radio receiver.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.036
Caroline must have
taken the transmitter

02:04.036 --> 02:06.169
and left this behind
to help you guys find her.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.866
Okay, but how can
an old radio do anything

02:07.866 --> 02:08.954
besides play music?

02:08.954 --> 02:10.260
Think of it like

02:10.260 --> 02:12.132
Find My Friends'
great-grandfather.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.307
The closer we are
to the target,

02:13.307 --> 02:14.786
the shorter the time
between the beeps.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.136
Did you get a location?

02:16.136 --> 02:18.747
The beeps suggest
she's 10 to 15 miles east.

02:18.747 --> 02:20.140
Okay, that puts her
near downtown.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.315
So we can do this.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.447
We save Caroline.
She stops the sinkhole.

02:23.447 --> 02:26.189
Everyone in Santa Monica lives
to eat another corndog.

02:26.189 --> 02:27.669
So you guys got any idea
who took her?

02:27.669 --> 02:29.845
No, but Caroline
did say something

02:29.845 --> 02:31.368
about someone named James.

02:34.502 --> 02:36.025
Okay, what's our plan
for getting downtown?

02:36.025 --> 02:37.722
Well, my dad owns a van.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.115
I mean, right about now
he should be off

02:39.115 --> 02:41.335
on his annual fishing trip
with his Marine buddies,

02:41.335 --> 02:43.293
which means we can help
ourselves to his ride.

02:43.293 --> 02:44.729
We better get going.

02:44.729 --> 02:47.123
In 48 hours, all of this
will be underwater.

02:58.003 --> 02:59.353
Did you spot Caroline?

02:59.353 --> 03:01.311
Ground floor, northeast
corner of the building.

03:01.311 --> 03:02.443
- Anyone armed?
- Two guards.

03:02.443 --> 03:03.574
But the room
they're keeping her in

03:03.574 --> 03:04.880
has multiple access points.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.708
Snatch and grab sounds
like our best bet.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.449
We go through the back,
we take them out together.

03:08.449 --> 03:10.102
That's too risky.
There could be guards

03:10.102 --> 03:11.278
down any of those hallways.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.062
We need to clear
that property first.

03:13.062 --> 03:14.368
She's in danger
right now, okay?

03:14.368 --> 03:16.239
There's no time for that.
- There's always time.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.198
It's my mother.
This is what we're doing.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.855
Enough.

03:23.855 --> 03:24.856
We go with Gavin's plan.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.471
Fine. Lead the way.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.215
Be careful, all of you.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.520
Yeah.

03:43.658 --> 03:46.530
We've gone to a lot
of trouble tracking you down.

03:46.530 --> 03:49.707
Just tell us where
you're keeping the virus.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.755
I guess we do this
the hard way then.

04:03.373 --> 04:06.246
Hey, we're getting you
out of here.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.769
Do I know you?

04:09.466 --> 04:13.296
It's me, Isiah.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.083
Oh, thank God.

04:20.912 --> 04:23.088
I can't believe it.

04:23.088 --> 04:24.916
How?

04:24.916 --> 04:26.570
I'll explain everything
once we're out here.

04:26.570 --> 04:27.702
- Okay.
- Hey, should we be

04:27.702 --> 04:29.181
expecting any more company?

04:29.181 --> 04:30.226
There were more of them,

04:30.226 --> 04:31.532
but I don't know
where they went.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.273
I'm gonna go clear
the rest of the building.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.492
Levi, wait for us!

04:35.492 --> 04:38.103
Levi!

04:47.374 --> 04:48.897
Levi!

04:48.897 --> 04:50.159
Start the van.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.349
- Okay.
- Easy.

05:06.349 --> 05:08.003
Okay, okay.

05:09.178 --> 05:10.484
Oh, my God.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.096
Ah.

05:14.096 --> 05:16.359
Riley, my dad kept a first
aid kit inside the trailer.

05:16.359 --> 05:17.578
Go grab it.
- Got it.

05:17.578 --> 05:18.666
Gonna move you on your side.

05:18.666 --> 05:19.884
- Okay.
- Easy.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.324
Ah. Ah.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.847
Is he gonna be okay?

05:25.847 --> 05:27.109
Yeah, it looks like
a through and through.

05:27.109 --> 05:28.545
Won't be pretty,
but he'll be all right.

05:28.545 --> 05:29.590
Well, that's great to hear.

05:29.590 --> 05:30.678
Thank God.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.335
Hey, what's going on?

05:35.335 --> 05:37.380
I need to get home
and finish my work.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.381
The virus isn't done.

05:38.381 --> 05:39.730
Your place is compromised.

05:39.730 --> 05:40.992
You said there are more
of those guys

05:40.992 --> 05:42.298
from the warehouse.
They're--they're gonna

05:42.298 --> 05:43.430
come looking for you.
- Well, that's a risk

05:43.430 --> 05:44.692
I have to take
if you want any chance

05:44.692 --> 05:45.606
at stopping the tidal wave.

05:47.172 --> 05:49.392
Okay, but you're not
doing this alone.

05:49.392 --> 05:50.828
We can take that Jeep.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.308
The keys are on the dash.
- No.

05:52.308 --> 05:54.092
Dad, we are coming with you.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.355
We can't split up,

05:55.355 --> 05:57.139
not right after we just
got back together.

06:00.490 --> 06:01.578
Okay, we stay together.

06:01.578 --> 06:03.406
Let's go.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.234
Ah! Ah!

06:06.714 --> 06:08.585
I'll be right there. Hey.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.070
Gavin and the kids are
gonna go with Caroline.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.288
She's gonna finish the virus.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.034
Eve, go with your family.

06:23.034 --> 06:24.775
They could use the backup.

06:26.255 --> 06:28.518
I'm in good hands. Go.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.128
Go.

07:03.814 --> 07:05.337
Don't move, Taamet.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.504
Take him to the cell.

07:43.724 --> 07:45.595
Ty! Paara!

07:45.595 --> 07:47.249
We need help!

07:47.249 --> 07:48.293
Lucas?

07:48.293 --> 07:49.469
Come on.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.644
Come on, come on. Come on.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.646
Hey.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.386
Lucas. Lucas?

07:54.386 --> 07:55.431
When I was here before,

07:55.431 --> 07:57.259
I saw a man
with the same marks.

07:57.259 --> 07:59.000
I thought you'd know
how to cure him.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.960
I'm sorry, but we don't.

08:06.007 --> 08:08.052
I have a way.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.793
What we need is nearby.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.360
I can show you.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.970
No, he's lying.

08:12.970 --> 08:14.232
Your friend got his marks

08:14.232 --> 08:16.104
thanks to someone
from the tower, yes?

08:16.104 --> 08:17.584
He did.

08:17.584 --> 08:20.108
As the marks spread,
his body's begun to turn numb.

08:20.108 --> 08:21.849
- Yeah, that's right.
- Soon, your friend won't

08:21.849 --> 08:25.679
be able to feel
or move any part of himself.

08:25.679 --> 08:28.899
Then he'll be hours from death.

08:28.899 --> 08:30.858
Unless I help.

08:30.858 --> 08:33.556
I think we should
listen to him.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.040
Fine.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.563
Then tell us what you need.

08:40.563 --> 08:43.305
I need my wife

08:43.305 --> 08:46.308
to swear that she'll let me go
once I heal him.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.918
You can't talk your way
out of this, Taamet.

08:47.918 --> 08:50.834
Then let me face it

08:50.834 --> 08:52.444
in my people's way...

08:54.925 --> 08:58.973
Trial by combat.

09:00.452 --> 09:03.238
I lose, you keep me,
and I give you the cure.

09:03.238 --> 09:05.457
I win, I go free.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.722
Fine.

09:08.722 --> 09:09.723
I accept.

09:11.507 --> 09:13.553
I'm not challenging you.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.206
I'm challenging him.

09:17.818 --> 09:20.864
Unless he doesn't
feel up to it.

09:27.871 --> 09:31.396
No, I accept.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.224
No, he doesn't.

09:35.662 --> 09:36.880
Take him away.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.118
Wait here.

10:05.866 --> 10:08.129
Okay, the house is clear.

10:08.129 --> 10:10.000
Good.
I'll work as fast as I can.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.785
Okay.
We'll keep an eye out.

10:11.785 --> 10:13.569
Y-you sh--you should go.

10:13.569 --> 10:15.005
It's not every day
you get to meet your mom

10:15.005 --> 10:16.572
for the first time. Go.

10:19.488 --> 10:20.837
I'll watch out back.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.665
Call out if you need me.
- Okay.

10:36.548 --> 10:37.854
I missed you.

10:39.203 --> 10:41.205
I don't know why, but I did.

10:41.205 --> 10:43.991
Wow.
I wish I had that on tape.

10:47.081 --> 10:48.691
I missed you too.

10:52.477 --> 10:53.957
It's so good
to finally see Dad again.

10:53.957 --> 10:56.394
How--how's he been?

10:58.309 --> 11:00.572
Honestly, pretty incredible.

11:00.572 --> 11:03.010
I mean, he's like
a different person.

11:03.010 --> 11:06.100
I feel like such an ass.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.537
I was so angry at him
for all those years.

11:08.537 --> 11:09.799
He didn't deserve it.

11:09.799 --> 11:12.715
You didn't know
what he was going through.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.891
He didn't even know.

11:17.241 --> 11:19.940
Just say you're sorry
and move on.

11:22.159 --> 11:24.161
When did you get so smart?

11:25.772 --> 11:27.382
I was born this way.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.821
I know things
have been hard, Iz.

11:31.821 --> 11:36.217
But don't you think Mom and Dad
actually seem happy together?

11:39.786 --> 11:41.091
Totally.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.229
That's it.

11:48.229 --> 11:50.013
You're all done, my friend.

11:50.013 --> 11:51.754
You're a natural. Thanks.

11:51.754 --> 11:54.061
A natural who might just
end up going to med school

11:54.061 --> 11:56.063
if we ever get home.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.412
Your mom would be proud.

12:00.807 --> 12:01.895
I'll clean this up.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.033
Now that you're
all patched up,

12:10.033 --> 12:10.947
you want to tell me
what happened

12:10.947 --> 12:12.775
back in the warehouse?

12:12.775 --> 12:14.951
I made a bad call.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.474
You did a hell
of a lot more than that.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.346
You nearly got yourself killed.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.652
I know.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.742
I just--

12:22.742 --> 12:25.266
I let myself get distracted

12:25.266 --> 12:27.921
by everything going on
with Eve.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.315
I need to get my head right.

12:31.315 --> 12:34.014
I just don't know how.

12:37.321 --> 12:38.932
I'm not gonna tell
you what to do here,

12:38.932 --> 12:40.977
but she's just reunited
with her family.

12:40.977 --> 12:43.937
I know it's not easy, but...

12:43.937 --> 12:46.896
you need to figure
some things out.

12:58.603 --> 13:00.692
Nice hiding spot.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.346
So everything you need

13:02.346 --> 13:04.827
to stop the sinkholes,
it's on that?

13:04.827 --> 13:06.089
That's the hope.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.656
I've been here for years,

13:07.656 --> 13:09.658
trying to cobble together
whatever tech I could find

13:09.658 --> 13:11.051
to write this virus.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.356
But I'm close.

13:16.534 --> 13:18.449
How old was I when you left?

13:21.713 --> 13:23.367
You were three.

13:24.847 --> 13:25.979
Mm.

13:30.505 --> 13:35.379
Leaving me with my father was,
uh, out of the question?

13:35.379 --> 13:40.210
Your father
is a complicated man.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.430
Yeah, I got that
from meeting him.

13:42.430 --> 13:44.736
- You met him?
- I did.

13:44.736 --> 13:48.349
If his goal was
to save the Earth,

13:48.349 --> 13:50.003
there must be a way
of reaching him, right?

13:50.003 --> 13:51.308
He sent those men to stop me

13:51.308 --> 13:52.919
from saving thousands
of people.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.877
He also helped me
find my son.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.139
Believe me.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.967
He's more dangerous
than he appears.

14:02.058 --> 14:03.712
So what's the plan?

14:03.712 --> 14:07.194
You go back to 10,000 B.C.
through the Hollywood sinkhole,

14:07.194 --> 14:08.848
just go into the building and--

14:08.848 --> 14:10.414
and upload the virus?

14:10.414 --> 14:14.549
And stop the sinkholes and
destroy the portal for good.

14:14.549 --> 14:17.073
Wait, wait, hold--
destroy the portal?

14:17.073 --> 14:19.249
Yes.
As long as it's operational,

14:19.249 --> 14:20.598
the sinkholes will
keep opening.

14:20.598 --> 14:23.906
No, but you can still
send us back home first,

14:23.906 --> 14:25.212
right, back to our time?

14:25.212 --> 14:27.257
Every time that portal
is bent to a new time,

14:27.257 --> 14:29.390
it creates a new sinkhole,
potentially even more

14:29.390 --> 14:32.219
catastrophic than the ones
we've already seen.

14:32.219 --> 14:35.048
I'm sorry.

14:35.048 --> 14:37.050
Your family can't go home.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.452
So what does that mean?
We have to stay here in '88?

14:48.452 --> 14:50.411
Or we go back to 10,000 B.C.,

14:50.411 --> 14:51.716
which is definitely worse.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.457
Okay, hey, I--I know
this is hard to hear,

14:53.457 --> 14:55.372
but, hey,
look on the bright side.

14:55.372 --> 14:57.026
The four of us, we're together.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.726
Yeah. Your dad's right.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.511
We fought so hard
to get back together.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.252
And now we're here.
Who cares when it is?

15:06.949 --> 15:09.909
Josh, what do you think?

15:09.909 --> 15:12.215
You want to trade the LA Rams
for the Raiders?

15:12.215 --> 15:15.958
Hey, Josh, what's going on?

15:15.958 --> 15:18.961
I--I guess I'm just thinking
about everything I can

15:18.961 --> 15:20.963
make up for.

15:20.963 --> 15:23.792
I was so unfair to you, Dad.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.489
You needed us,
and I wasn't there.

15:25.489 --> 15:29.015
Hey, kiddo,
it's not your fault.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.755
No one knew
my visions were real.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.366
Yeah, but--but they were.
It's the only reason

15:32.366 --> 15:34.020
we're here right now.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.717
You needed someone
to trust you.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.501
And I--I should have
believed you.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.416
Hey, you weren't the only one
who didn't listen.

15:39.416 --> 15:42.245
Hey, no one has anything
to apologize for.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.900
Okay?
- Okay.

15:44.900 --> 15:47.250
Okay. Hey.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.648
I love you.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.519
I love you too.

15:58.174 --> 16:01.264
Iz, well, what do you think?

16:01.264 --> 16:02.787
The four of us in '88?

16:09.751 --> 16:12.580
That sounds great.

16:12.580 --> 16:14.234
I'm gonna go check out back.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.498
I-I'll go.

16:20.501 --> 16:21.676
Hey.

16:23.765 --> 16:25.985
It's okay to be confused
about this whole

16:25.985 --> 16:26.986
living in the '80s.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.291
It's a lot to process.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.815
It's not the '80s
that confuse me, Mom.

16:30.815 --> 16:31.947
It's you.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.514
What do you mean?

16:33.514 --> 16:36.430
Are you and Dad
back together again?

16:36.430 --> 16:38.171
Look, that is all I want,

16:38.171 --> 16:41.652
but only if you really
want it too.

16:41.652 --> 16:44.307
Of c--yes,
of course I want it too.

16:44.307 --> 16:47.484
Are you sure?

16:47.484 --> 16:50.052
I saw you back there
at the trailer with Levi.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.271
Mom, you didn't want to leave.

16:51.271 --> 16:54.056
Yes, because he had just
been shot, Izzy.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.623
Levi's been a part
of our family.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.320
He has been for years,
your dad's included.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.062
Yeah, but you told me
you still love him.

17:00.062 --> 17:03.631
Look, if you get back together
for the wrong reasons--

17:03.631 --> 17:06.721
because of me,
because of Josh--

17:06.721 --> 17:09.071
it will not last.

17:09.071 --> 17:10.986
And the only thing harder
than you guys splitting up

17:10.986 --> 17:14.598
the first time would be having
to live through that again.

17:18.863 --> 17:20.343
We should tell them

17:20.343 --> 17:22.215
what Caroline said.

17:23.912 --> 17:26.219
Do you need help?

17:36.142 --> 17:38.840
On a scale of 1 to 10,
what's your pain level?

17:38.840 --> 17:40.189
Shut up, Scott!

17:40.189 --> 17:42.104
Sounds like a 10.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.714
I just spoke to Ty.

17:43.714 --> 17:45.368
He's gonna try and get Paara
to reconsider.

17:45.368 --> 17:46.717
What's the point?

17:46.717 --> 17:49.372
There's no way
Ty is gonna beat that guy.

17:49.372 --> 17:50.634
There's got
to be painkillers

17:50.634 --> 17:53.594
or mushrooms
or something in here.

17:55.639 --> 17:56.858
Damn it!

17:56.858 --> 17:58.599
None of this looks
like it'll work.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.603
We need Taamet's cure.

18:04.953 --> 18:05.954
What are you thinking?

18:13.309 --> 18:14.397
Keep him hydrated.

18:14.397 --> 18:15.616
I got to go.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.792
What? Where? Scott!

18:20.882 --> 18:22.013
Here.
- No.

18:22.013 --> 18:23.624
I don't want any.
- You need it, Lucas.

18:23.624 --> 18:24.886
I thought you wanted
to fight this.

18:24.886 --> 18:27.584
I did when I thought
there was a chance.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.717
But there isn't one.

18:32.328 --> 18:34.939
Maybe I don't
deserve one anyway.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.941
Why would you say that?

18:36.941 --> 18:40.858
Because I've done a lot of
things in my life, Veronica.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.125
And a lot of people would say

18:46.125 --> 18:47.691
that this is what I had coming.

18:49.737 --> 18:50.912
I don't believe that.

18:50.912 --> 18:54.437
Yeah, well, you should.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.787
I was a heroin dealer.

18:59.964 --> 19:01.009
Lucas--

19:06.319 --> 19:08.712
Veronica, I can't move my arms.

19:10.279 --> 19:12.542
I can't move anything.

19:12.542 --> 19:13.978
It's just like Taamet said.

19:13.978 --> 19:15.154
Oh, God.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.122
Paara.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.474
You have to let me
fight Taamet.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.998
Ty, no.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.565
It's the only way
to save Lucas.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.219
Taamet is a trained warrior.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.699
If you take him on,
he'll kill you.

19:38.699 --> 19:41.658
Paara... I have to.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.965
Why?

19:43.965 --> 19:45.140
Look...

19:47.621 --> 19:49.753
This disease I have,

19:49.753 --> 19:52.278
it robbed me everything I was.

19:52.278 --> 19:56.586
I lost family, friends,
my practice.

19:56.586 --> 19:59.415
I very nearly lost myself.

19:59.415 --> 20:00.808
I haven't told you this before,

20:00.808 --> 20:04.768
but I almost took my own life.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.774
Ty, I'm sorry.

20:10.774 --> 20:11.906
But I didn't.

20:11.906 --> 20:14.778
I've found a new purpose
down here,

20:14.778 --> 20:16.911
and I promised myself to fight

20:16.911 --> 20:19.218
for my own life and
for the people I care about.

20:19.218 --> 20:23.091
If I don't do this,
if I don't fight,

20:23.091 --> 20:24.658
it's as if I'm giving up
on life itself.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.486
I've been there before.

20:26.486 --> 20:27.835
I can't go back there again.

20:29.576 --> 20:31.186
Ty.

20:33.319 --> 20:36.060
I can't send you off to die.
- I know.

20:36.060 --> 20:38.411
Taamet won't show mercy.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.283
He'll enjoy this.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.853
What do you mean?

20:45.853 --> 20:47.550
Despite everything,
I believe Taamet is still

20:47.550 --> 20:48.856
in love with me.

20:53.904 --> 20:58.474
I understand why this is
so important to you.

20:58.474 --> 21:00.781
But you're important to me too.

21:02.696 --> 21:05.133
And you won't win.

21:06.613 --> 21:10.181
Well, as much as I appreciate
the vote of confidence,

21:10.181 --> 21:14.360
who says you have to win
with a spear?

21:14.360 --> 21:16.797
What are you thinking?

21:16.797 --> 21:18.929
That there are other ways
to win a fight.

21:23.586 --> 21:26.589
Hey. Caroline says she's
almost done with the virus.

21:26.589 --> 21:28.461
When she is, we'll bring her
to the Hollywood sinkhole.

21:28.461 --> 21:30.027
Okay.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.856
What is it?

21:32.856 --> 21:36.338
I think we should
go with her.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.732
Are you serious?

21:38.732 --> 21:41.778
What, you want to go back and
get eaten by a woolly mammoth?

21:41.778 --> 21:44.694
Dad, we can stay in 1988.

21:44.694 --> 21:46.653
At least here,
we have lights, plumbing,

21:46.653 --> 21:48.698
medical school.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.309
And we have the Harrises.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.049
The Harrises are not
our family.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.356
But they're our friends.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.358
That's not good enough.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.534
We're going back, and we're
gonna find a way home.

21:58.534 --> 21:59.883
How?

22:01.407 --> 22:03.060
The world's top expert
in this just said

22:03.060 --> 22:04.148
that the portal needs
to be destroyed.

22:04.148 --> 22:05.236
Then we'll find an Aurora.

22:05.236 --> 22:07.064
The Auroras are
gonna be gone too.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.631
Caroline's virus stops everything.

22:08.631 --> 22:10.851
She's not the only scientist
that knows about this stuff.

22:10.851 --> 22:13.375
We'll find someone else.

22:13.375 --> 22:17.988
Riley, this is our family
we're talking about.

22:17.988 --> 22:20.077
I don't know how to give up
on getting back to them.

22:21.514 --> 22:24.734
I know I can't make up
for Mom and Andrew being gone.

22:24.734 --> 22:27.084
- That's--
- But Dad,

22:27.084 --> 22:29.609
at least here we have a future.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.408
Should you be up
and walking around?

22:46.408 --> 22:47.496
Probably not.

22:50.934 --> 22:52.762
Hey, what happened
back in the warehouse?

22:55.548 --> 22:57.593
I was thinking about you,

22:57.593 --> 22:59.160
you know, when, um--

22:59.160 --> 23:02.511
when Gavin disappeared
into a bottle.

23:02.511 --> 23:06.254
I was the one you came to
when things got hard.

23:08.169 --> 23:11.302
Eve, showing up made me happy.

23:13.653 --> 23:17.091
I'm thinking about what's best
for everyone,

23:17.091 --> 23:21.008
for this family and for you.

23:21.008 --> 23:23.140
It's me, Eve.

23:25.839 --> 23:28.102
I want to stay here

23:28.102 --> 23:30.409
and build the kind of family
that you deserve.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.803
We gotta move!

23:33.803 --> 23:36.415
Hey! We gotta move!

23:36.415 --> 23:38.242
The Lazarus agents,
they're here.

23:38.242 --> 23:40.810
Two vehicles just landed
50 yards up the street.

23:40.810 --> 23:42.464
Josh and Izzy are out back.
They're keeping watch.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.466
I'll get them in the van.
- I'll grab Caroline.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.079
Our friends are back.

23:49.079 --> 23:50.994
Is the virus done?

23:50.994 --> 23:52.082
Is it done?
- Yes, but I--

23:52.082 --> 23:53.780
Okay, we got to go now.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.438
Quick, they're coming. In here.

24:18.108 --> 24:20.546
You're burning up.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.069
- Mm-mm.
- You need water.

24:22.069 --> 24:23.505
Mm-mm.

24:23.505 --> 24:27.074
Just promise me...

24:27.074 --> 24:29.250
you'll bury me next to my mom.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.252
You can't give up, Lucas.

24:33.080 --> 24:36.562
I know it's hard.

24:36.562 --> 24:39.869
But I've seen people as low
as you find a way through.

24:43.090 --> 24:46.528
Before I went into foster care,
I lived with my mom.

24:46.528 --> 24:50.010
She was a good person.

24:50.010 --> 24:52.578
But she was an addict.

24:52.578 --> 24:59.062
And... whenever she tried
to get clean,

24:59.062 --> 25:01.761
she'd do this ritual where
she'd write down her regrets

25:01.761 --> 25:05.547
on a piece of paper
and light them on fire.

25:05.547 --> 25:10.117
She told me if--
if you name them,

25:10.117 --> 25:13.512
you can burn away the parts
of yourself you didn't like.

25:15.557 --> 25:17.211
She got clean, Lucas,

25:17.211 --> 25:20.867
and I know that if my mom could
fight through all of that,

25:20.867 --> 25:23.478
then you can too.

25:23.478 --> 25:26.437
What am I fighting for,
Veronica?

25:28.352 --> 25:30.006
Seriously.

25:32.008 --> 25:34.837
No one's gonna miss me
when I'm gone.

25:37.187 --> 25:39.015
I would.

25:41.627 --> 25:44.804
You're the only person
down here who understands me.

25:47.197 --> 25:49.548
No one else has been through
what we have.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.094
I'll have that water.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.856
Remember what
we talked about,

26:36.856 --> 26:39.075
how to strike at his weakness.

26:45.429 --> 26:48.171
Are we fighting or not?

26:57.746 --> 27:01.794
You fight until one yields
or one dies.

27:08.670 --> 27:11.064
Come on, Ty.

27:11.064 --> 27:12.239
Begin!

27:30.257 --> 27:31.650
She's not impressed.

27:42.486 --> 27:43.662
She doesn't love you.

27:44.619 --> 27:45.620
She never will.

27:45.620 --> 27:46.969
Shut your mouth.

27:56.283 --> 27:57.980
She loves me, Taamet.

27:57.980 --> 27:58.981
Ah!

28:00.461 --> 28:01.549
How does that feel?

28:16.390 --> 28:17.521
Aah!

28:28.968 --> 28:31.100
How does that feel, Paara?

28:35.757 --> 28:40.719
Do you yield?

29:03.437 --> 29:04.612
The sinkhole's just up ahead.

29:04.612 --> 29:06.570
Let's keep moving.

29:10.574 --> 29:13.012
You're hiding something.

29:13.012 --> 29:15.536
I could tell back at the house.

29:15.536 --> 29:17.364
What is it?

29:17.364 --> 29:18.800
The virus is ready.

29:18.800 --> 29:21.063
But uploading it is gonna be
a complicated process.

29:21.063 --> 29:23.500
I need to get past
a security lock.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.807
I thought I could code my way
around it, but I couldn't.

29:25.807 --> 29:28.418
Okay.
What kind of lock?

29:28.418 --> 29:29.724
It's genetic.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.552
We need a handprint.

29:31.552 --> 29:37.993
Gavin, only two people in this
world can get past that lock.

29:40.691 --> 29:42.258
Me and my father?

29:43.825 --> 29:45.609
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you earlier.

29:45.609 --> 29:46.741
I--I thought I could fix it.

29:46.741 --> 29:48.003
I thought I could
prevent you having

29:48.003 --> 29:51.224
to sacrifice the way I did.

29:51.224 --> 29:53.313
What does this mean?

29:54.967 --> 29:57.230
If you don't come back
to 10,000 B.C. with me,

29:57.230 --> 30:00.755
we can't stop these sinkholes
or that tidal wave.

30:00.755 --> 30:02.626
You have to come with me.

30:02.626 --> 30:04.759
Hey.

30:04.759 --> 30:06.630
We've got an issue.

30:16.945 --> 30:20.035
Look, more Lazarus agents.

30:20.035 --> 30:21.602
They're here for Caroline.

30:23.734 --> 30:25.649
How are we gonna
get past them?

30:29.175 --> 30:31.438
Hey.

30:31.438 --> 30:34.093
I've got an idea.

30:34.093 --> 30:35.834
But we're gonna have
to give them what they want.

30:50.761 --> 30:52.241
There she is.

30:52.241 --> 30:53.634
Hey!

30:55.941 --> 30:57.986
What the hell's she doing?

31:26.972 --> 31:28.147
Huh!

31:43.205 --> 31:44.815
You good?

31:44.815 --> 31:45.947
Yeah.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.048
I hope Taamet didn't
poison this.

32:00.048 --> 32:01.832
Have a little bit more.

32:01.832 --> 32:03.660
It's not like
you have another choice.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.662
Here, come on.

32:05.662 --> 32:07.403
Come on.

32:08.317 --> 32:10.493
- A little more.
- Mm.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.931
Mm-hmm, okay.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.758
Ugh.

32:18.284 --> 32:20.373
Hey.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.558
Hey.

32:31.558 --> 32:33.342
It's working.

32:34.691 --> 32:37.781
Hey, can you move anything?

32:47.052 --> 32:48.618
Thank you, Ty.

32:48.618 --> 32:49.750
I don't know
how you beat that guy,

32:49.750 --> 32:52.231
but I'm glad you did.

32:52.231 --> 32:54.973
Yeah, it was something.

32:57.671 --> 32:59.978
I-I'm gonna be right back.

33:17.212 --> 33:19.693
Your cure worked.

33:21.347 --> 33:22.739
Good.

33:22.739 --> 33:25.394
I held up my end of the deal.

33:25.394 --> 33:27.048
Are you ready to do the same?

33:30.573 --> 33:33.098
We agreed.

33:33.098 --> 33:34.882
If I threw the fight,
I'd give you the cure,

33:34.882 --> 33:37.406
and you'd let me go.

33:37.406 --> 33:38.451
Right.

33:38.451 --> 33:40.453
But you didn't throw the fight.

33:40.453 --> 33:41.541
Ty beat you.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.630
I don't lose.

33:43.630 --> 33:44.848
You're lying.

33:44.848 --> 33:47.982
You lost fair and square.

33:47.982 --> 33:50.680
That means no deal.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.247
You're going to let me go.

33:52.247 --> 33:55.555
If you don't,
your friend will still die.

33:58.993 --> 34:00.777
What are you talking about?

34:00.777 --> 34:03.432
I left out one ingredient.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.696
But I saw him.

34:06.696 --> 34:07.654
He was getting better.

34:07.654 --> 34:10.048
Would you bet his life
on that?

34:14.226 --> 34:16.663
Now cut me loose.

34:28.892 --> 34:30.459
Now give me the ingredient.

34:48.825 --> 34:52.177
You and everyone you know
will pay for this.

34:52.177 --> 34:54.092
I can promise you that.

35:15.156 --> 35:16.810
We have less than 24 hours

35:16.810 --> 35:21.075
before that tidal wave
destroys Santa Monica.

35:21.075 --> 35:22.816
We have to go now.

35:28.038 --> 35:30.128
I need to talk to my family.

35:41.791 --> 35:43.097
I don't like that look.

35:46.187 --> 35:50.278
For her plan to work,
she needs me.

35:50.278 --> 35:51.932
I don't understand.

35:51.932 --> 35:53.412
There's a lock on the portal.

35:53.412 --> 35:57.155
It requires a handprint
to open it.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.983
Only my father and I can do it.

35:59.983 --> 36:01.550
So you have to go back?

36:01.550 --> 36:02.943
Dad, that is not fair.

36:02.943 --> 36:04.640
Yeah, I know.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.294
It isn't.

36:06.294 --> 36:07.774
Are you going?

36:12.257 --> 36:15.956
Gavin,
you don't have a choice.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.392
You have to go.

36:19.307 --> 36:21.309
We're the ones
who have to make a choice.

36:21.309 --> 36:23.006
No.
No, no, no, no, you can't,

36:23.006 --> 36:25.270
Okay?
It's too dangerous.

36:25.270 --> 36:26.488
I can't risk losing you.

36:26.488 --> 36:27.881
If you go without us,
you already have.

36:30.275 --> 36:31.667
I'm in.

36:33.843 --> 36:35.323
Me too.

36:37.673 --> 36:39.153
Looks like we're
going with you.

36:43.244 --> 36:44.680
Okay.

36:48.858 --> 36:49.816
Yeah.

36:52.122 --> 36:54.821
Give me a second, okay?

36:54.821 --> 36:56.388
Yeah.

37:03.873 --> 37:05.484
I get it, you know?

37:05.484 --> 37:08.704
I think about Mom and Andrew
every minute of every day.

37:08.704 --> 37:12.491
I know.

37:12.491 --> 37:15.537
I'm just not ready to give up.

37:15.537 --> 37:18.584
Are you?

37:18.584 --> 37:20.847
No.

37:20.847 --> 37:21.891
I'm going with you.

37:30.335 --> 37:33.773
I can't say that I'm happy,

37:33.773 --> 37:36.428
but I get it.

37:36.428 --> 37:37.733
Levi, you--
you helped me through one

37:37.733 --> 37:39.126
of the hardest times
of my life,

37:39.126 --> 37:42.172
and I will never forget that.

37:53.619 --> 37:56.274
Good luck down there.

37:58.928 --> 38:00.278
What are you gonna do?

38:02.758 --> 38:04.412
I think I'll start
with a beer on the beach

38:04.412 --> 38:06.545
and then figure out
what's next.

38:16.816 --> 38:23.910

39:59.440 --> 40:02.051
Still can't move it.

40:02.051 --> 40:04.358
Give it time.

40:10.799 --> 40:13.367

41:19.085 --> 41:20.913
<i>Wake up.
Eve!</i>

41:22.958 --> 41:24.786
You all right?

41:27.093 --> 41:29.574
You had that look,

41:29.574 --> 41:31.401
the one you used to get
before you had a vision.

41:31.401 --> 41:33.186
Did you see something?

41:35.449 --> 41:37.103
- Nothing.
- You sure?

41:37.103 --> 41:41.107
As long as you're with me,
I'm fine.

41:41.107 --> 41:42.978
All of you.

41:44.589 --> 41:46.155
Okay?

41:47.896 --> 41:49.028
Let's go.
