08:39.920 --> 08:44.620
Aha. So you think
it might get serious,

08:44.620 --> 08:47.710

serious is on the table.

some pre-algebra.

11:39.790 --> 11:41.830
Mr. Brown
went grocery shopping--

11:41.830 --> 11:44.380
How come
someone's always shopping
in these problems?

11:44.380 --> 11:46.250
Come up here
and work it out.

11:46.250 --> 11:48.290
Nah. I can do it from here.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.750
(sighs)

11:59.750 --> 12:01.460
Twenty-five.

12:01.460 --> 12:03.880
How did you arrive
at that answer?

12:03.880 --> 12:05.080
Is it right?

12:05.080 --> 12:07.920
-No.
-Then who cares
how I got it?

12:07.920 --> 12:10.040
Because it helps
to know your thought process.

12:10.040 --> 12:11.500
I guessed.

12:11.500 --> 12:12.620
Does that help?

12:13.790 --> 12:17.120
T.J., if you don't know
the answer, that's fine.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.120
But you have to be
honest with me.

12:19.120 --> 12:22.250
Do any of these types
of problems even look
familiar to you?

12:22.250 --> 12:25.000
Sure.
I've seen 'em before.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.080
Couldn't do them then,
and I can't do them now.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.120
Maybe you need to do
some warm-up exercises?

12:31.120 --> 12:35.000
Like with basketball!
You have a better chance
of making a tough basket

12:35.000 --> 12:36.250
if you're warmed up.

12:36.250 --> 12:39.500
Seriously?
You're gonna
use basketball analogies?

12:39.500 --> 12:42.120
Like, do you think
that's the only thing
I'll understand?

12:42.120 --> 12:44.080
Hey, you know
what really helps me?

12:45.330 --> 12:47.460
The multiplication tables!

12:47.460 --> 12:49.080
And you gotta try this board.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.290
It's super fun!

12:50.290 --> 12:51.290
Pass.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.420
Fine. Use paper if you want.

13:01.540 --> 13:05.460
You do know the
multiplication tables, right?

13:05.460 --> 13:08.080
You think I'm stupid?

13:08.080 --> 13:10.000
I never said that.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.920
Well... I am.

13:21.170 --> 13:24.250
You know, I'm starting
to think that I don't
wanna meet Miranda.

13:24.250 --> 13:27.170
Because if I do,
that means it's serious,

13:27.170 --> 13:29.170
and I can't handle
another parent

13:29.170 --> 13:31.080
or parent equivalent.

13:31.080 --> 13:34.210
Hey... no matter
what happens,

13:34.210 --> 13:37.170
we're his family,
and you're his daughter.

13:37.170 --> 13:39.830
Nothing's gonna change that.

13:39.830 --> 13:42.000
Yeah. I know.
You're right.

13:43.420 --> 13:46.580
Besides, we both know
that this story ends
with Bex and Bowie

13:46.580 --> 13:48.250
living happily ever after.

to get a hall pass.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.460

17:16.460 --> 17:20.250
No, I mean, I think
you have a learning disability.

You can learn math.

17:29.290 --> 17:30.960
You're just wired differently.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.830
The first step
is to get you tested.

to Mr. Coleman.
