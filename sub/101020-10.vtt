00:12.429 --> 00:14.431
How did Alyssa just disappear like that?

00:14.806 --> 00:16.891
She didn't just disappear.

00:18.059 --> 00:20.729
-She simply slowed time...

00:22.022 --> 00:23.231
to her advantage.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.983
Oh, yeah. "Simply."

00:25.567 --> 00:29.821
Alyssa Drake is an accomplished
practitioner, Mr. Morton.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.365
The Vade Maecum
is still in her possession.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.492
She would never try and do
what Coventry did.

00:34.576 --> 00:35.744
It's still a grimoire,

00:36.327 --> 00:38.747
and those spells can be performed
à la carte.

00:41.916 --> 00:46.963
How did you know Salvador was going
to attempt a murder-suicide?

00:47.047 --> 00:48.965
Alyssa mentioned a quote from Salvador

00:49.049 --> 00:51.509
about Psophis, Lycaon's daughter.
She made the same move.

00:53.636 --> 00:55.013
You saved my life.

00:56.973 --> 00:57.974
Thank you.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.686
Yeah, I mean, thank Professor Benson.

01:02.145 --> 01:04.272
I only knew it because it was on the test.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.528
You actually use silver bullets.

01:10.904 --> 01:14.491
Unnecessary, I know,
but why take the risk?

01:14.741 --> 01:15.867
You know what you've done?

01:15.950 --> 01:17.452
Cut the head off a snake?

01:17.535 --> 01:19.579
Turned Salvador into a martyr,

01:19.662 --> 01:21.164
galvanized Alyssa against you.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.624
She'll be dealt with.

01:22.707 --> 01:25.502
Look, we were supposed to stop this
before anyone else got hurt.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.963
Praxis has made their intentions
perfectly clear.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.757
Well, I'm not gonna kill
a bunch of civilians

01:30.840 --> 01:33.051
that think magicking their way
to a free beer is cool.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.470
You know they are
far more dangerous than that.

01:35.553 --> 01:36.846
Alyssa is not Salvador.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.473
She knows our strengths,

01:38.556 --> 01:41.142
and she knows all of our weaknesses.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.852
That makes her exceedingly dangerous.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.354
Why do you hate her so much?

01:47.315 --> 01:50.193
Mr. Morton, you're relieved
from temple duties until further notice.

01:50.276 --> 01:53.404
-You're benching me?
-Your infatuation has become a liability.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.410
Yeah, well, uh, you're welcome
for saving your life.

01:59.494 --> 02:01.454
I said thank you.

02:02.872 --> 02:04.624
- What did you do to her?
<i>-</i>Nothing.

02:04.707 --> 02:07.085
I came in and found her passed out
in front of the lockers.

02:10.755 --> 02:11.798
Oh, shit.

02:13.174 --> 02:14.384
She didn't transform.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.468
Was she supposed to?

02:15.552 --> 02:16.469
Give me a hand.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.430
Okay. Yep.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.017
Usually that's how this works.

02:23.309 --> 02:26.479
The hide jumps you,
the hide bonds with you,

02:26.563 --> 02:28.314
then you run off and kill something.

02:28.731 --> 02:30.775
Maybe we should take her to Emergency.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.193
Hospitals can't help.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.197
Knowing Gabrielle,

02:36.281 --> 02:39.534
she's just waiting to make an entrance.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.496
She <i>is</i> going to wake up, right?

02:45.665 --> 02:46.666
Absolutely.

02:55.341 --> 02:56.259
Hello?

03:04.184 --> 03:05.143
Where am I?

03:07.770 --> 03:09.105
Where is everybody?

03:13.526 --> 03:14.611
This isn't funny!

03:19.866 --> 03:22.243
Still the baby badass, I see.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.039
Kyle?

03:27.582 --> 03:28.958
And now a werewolf.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.335
<i>-Mazel tov!</i>
<i>-</i>No.

03:31.252 --> 03:34.005
The last thing I remember,
I was being attacked by a shag rug.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.591
Oh, fuck me.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.843
This is all your fault, isn't it?

03:39.344 --> 03:40.178
You dick!

03:40.720 --> 03:41.596
You dead dick!

03:41.679 --> 03:43.681
Yeah. Thanks for that.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.975
You were the one who sent me
on that stupid werewolf hunt.

03:46.517 --> 03:47.727
Don't come any closer.

03:47.810 --> 03:48.728
Or what?

03:51.814 --> 03:53.816
Yeah, no magic here.

03:54.275 --> 03:55.693
Not for you, at least.

03:56.277 --> 03:59.155
Welcome to the collective unconscious,
new Midnight.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.951
A werewolf hide jumps me,
and I end up in some Jungian Six Flags?

04:03.034 --> 04:05.203
Oh, my God. Drop the act, okay?

04:06.120 --> 04:07.247
You wanted this.

04:07.622 --> 04:08.581
To be a werewolf?

04:09.249 --> 04:10.083
Gross.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.042
To belong.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.425
And as the current representative
of Midnight,

04:20.051 --> 04:21.928
the most noble of the Knights,

04:22.011 --> 04:24.514
you have a very important job to complete,

04:24.597 --> 04:27.433
and I think you're going to like it.
I know I would.

04:29.143 --> 04:31.271
You have to take down Silverback,

04:31.729 --> 04:34.482
which means you get to kill Jack Morton.

04:37.110 --> 04:37.944
Lucky.

04:48.788 --> 04:49.789
I will miss her.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.333
And I know she'd say,

04:52.625 --> 04:54.711
"This isn't about you, Alyssa."

04:56.838 --> 04:57.880
And she'd be right.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.049
It isn't about me.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.594
Just like it was never about her.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.771
Salvador Grant was brave...

05:15.940 --> 05:16.774
smart...

05:19.193 --> 05:20.111
selfless...

05:24.324 --> 05:26.492
and I will never be
everything that she was.

05:29.620 --> 05:30.788
But I can...

05:31.706 --> 05:33.249
carry her vision forward.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.376
We all can...

05:36.711 --> 05:38.713
by giving magic to anyone who wants it

05:38.796 --> 05:41.549
and bringing down those
who try to keep it for themselves.

05:42.425 --> 05:43.760
So to honor her...

05:45.136 --> 05:46.721
to honor Praxis...

05:48.306 --> 05:50.266
we cast a flame incantation

05:50.725 --> 05:52.977
without sacrifice.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.938
But that might cause one of the eruptions.

05:56.022 --> 05:56.856
Exactly.

05:58.024 --> 06:02.653
Which is why going forward, all magic
we perform will be done without sacrifice.

06:02.737 --> 06:06.616
That's like asking to be turned
into puppies, or inside out.

06:07.241 --> 06:08.659
Or inside-out puppies.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.204
Salvador wanted magic for the masses.

06:11.287 --> 06:14.082
The Order has the spell
that can make it a reality.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.250
So we're going to generate eruptions,

06:17.043 --> 06:20.588
and we'll keep generating them
until the Order gives us what we want.

06:22.715 --> 06:23.758
And if we refuse?

06:25.885 --> 06:26.803
Then go.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.513
If you're afraid...

06:29.347 --> 06:30.181
leave.

06:30.264 --> 06:31.682
If you disagree...

06:32.683 --> 06:33.559
leave.

06:34.435 --> 06:35.686
There will be no judgment.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.438
No reprisal.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.732
Salvador wanted us all to be free...

06:40.942 --> 06:45.113
to explore magic in our own way,
on our own terms.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.740
But Praxis will always be your home.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.701
And we will always welcome you back.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.465
On the count of three...

07:06.217 --> 07:07.510
we unleash Hell.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.096
One...

07:11.347 --> 07:12.223
two...

07:13.474 --> 07:14.308
three.

07:29.323 --> 07:31.367
Now! Run!

07:52.638 --> 07:54.515
Why does Midnight want Jack dead?

07:55.391 --> 07:56.392
He doesn't.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.644
Silverback's the problem.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.438
He's selfish.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.440
He chooses losers to be his champion,

08:02.523 --> 08:04.108
which explains Morton.

08:05.234 --> 08:08.988
The last time Silverback was unboxed,
he nearly completed the Vade Maecum.

08:10.114 --> 08:12.366
So now it's up to you
to put him back in his crate.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.784
No way.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.579
Jack's basic,
but it's not a killing offense.

08:16.662 --> 08:17.538
Fine.

08:17.955 --> 08:21.083
So then stay here for a few hours
and let Midnight take the driver's seat.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.045
Once Morton's dead
and Silverback's in his locker,

08:24.128 --> 08:25.338
then you get your body back.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.423
Midnight's happy, I'm happy,

08:27.507 --> 08:28.633
everyone's happy!

08:28.716 --> 08:30.676
I'm not letting some stupid wolf
take me over.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.013
Well, if you're not gonna listen to me...

08:35.389 --> 08:36.224
how about him?

08:38.309 --> 08:39.769
Another bad choice, I see.

08:40.811 --> 08:41.646
Papa?

08:41.729 --> 08:44.065
This is what we get
for all our sacrifices.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.149
I'm doing well this year.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.235
You got a 60 on your Ethics exam.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.154
I should've left the money
to your younger sister.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.614
Then it wouldn't be wasted.

08:51.697 --> 08:52.990
I'm trying, <i>Tatay.</i>

08:53.491 --> 08:54.534
I work so hard.

08:54.617 --> 08:57.245
Yet this is the best that you can do.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.789
And when you're done here,

09:00.289 --> 09:02.458
you'll come crawling back home

09:02.542 --> 09:04.585
with nothing and no one.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.379
That's not true. I have friends.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.256
I'm part of something big.

09:08.923 --> 09:09.924
Something important.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.260
You'll ruin that, too.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.845
So needy.

09:18.432 --> 09:19.517
This isn't real.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.440
Hm. I thought for sure
Daddy would have broke you.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.775
You seem the type.

09:29.193 --> 09:30.987
-None of this is real.

09:31.946 --> 09:32.780
It's real.

09:33.364 --> 09:34.198
Trust me.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.034
And this is a fight you can't win.

09:39.453 --> 09:40.329
Bring it.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.165
Disappointment doesn't even begin
to describe you.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.585
I don't even know why
we're wasting time on a loser like her.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.628
I can describe her. Incompetent...

09:47.712 --> 09:48.588
No.

09:48.671 --> 09:49.630
...uncoordinated...

09:49.714 --> 09:51.215
-No.
-...unattractive.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.884
-Useless.
-Weak.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.428
We love your hair.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.805
-No! No!
-Useless and weak.

09:57.888 --> 10:00.266
None of you are real!

10:01.517 --> 10:03.269
<i> We are not waiting any longer.</i>

10:03.352 --> 10:05.896
-It's already been two days.
- We have no choice.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.815
The eruptions are growing more unstable.

10:07.898 --> 10:09.692
Which is all the more reason to go now.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.110
We need to get Lilith out

10:11.193 --> 10:12.778
before those eruptions
make it impossible.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.698
-You're assuming the Order will lose.
-You're assuming they'll win.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.409
We will, when Vera performs
the<i> obquidio niquaedo.</i>

10:18.492 --> 10:20.286
And murders God knows how many people.

10:20.369 --> 10:21.704
To save God knows how many others.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.457
You've seen the news.
The eruptions are out of control.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.042
The <i>respondeos</i> aren't working anymore.

10:26.125 --> 10:30.254
No. All Vera has to do is give them
that damn<i> Fors Factoram</i> spell.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.006
This conversation is moot.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.301
We need four powerful practitioners
to get Lilith back.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.887
-We need Vera.
-We've got Nikki.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.055
She's only a magistratus.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.349
We're only magistratuses... eses.

10:41.432 --> 10:42.683
We're werewolves.

10:42.933 --> 10:47.021
A human magistratus isn't powerful enough
to open a passage to the demon realm.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.815
"Open a passage
to the demon realm." What...

10:50.441 --> 10:52.777
What happened to me?
I was gonna be a marine biologist.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.571
Oh, shit! Dude,
you finally figured out your major.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.824
Marine biology, or film school.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.951
That's what the apocalypse needs,
more film students.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.204
There isn't going to be an apocalypse,

11:03.287 --> 11:06.832
because we're going to rescue Lilith and
she's going to help us clean up this mess.

11:09.418 --> 11:11.545
And we just found our fourth practitioner.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.382
Who? Who is it?

11:14.465 --> 11:16.634
Out of my way, wench.
I have to find the others.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.511
I already told you, they're coming.

11:18.594 --> 11:19.887
Ju-- They'll be here soon.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.555
I should trust the lies of a witch?

11:21.639 --> 11:24.141
I'm not a witch, I'm a practitioner.
And so are you.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.811
You take that back
or I'll rip your heart out!

11:27.645 --> 11:28.521
Hey!

11:29.230 --> 11:30.231
She's all yours.

11:30.815 --> 11:31.899
I knew you weren't dead.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.238
Right. You're a werewolf now.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.491
-You're getting sloppy, Greybeard.

11:40.574 --> 11:41.659
Ow. Yep.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.035
So, Gabrielle,

11:43.119 --> 11:44.495
how are you feeling?

11:44.912 --> 11:46.497
I feel fine, Tundra.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.416
It's Hamish.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.917
You look...

11:50.000 --> 11:51.335
You look sturdy.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.837
Do you feel sturdier?

11:52.920 --> 11:55.589
I am sturdy, and strong.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.842
Committed to the cause.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.886
And Midnight, how is he treating you?

12:06.934 --> 12:08.436
With respect,

12:08.519 --> 12:10.730
which is more than I can say for you.

12:10.813 --> 12:11.981
Yeah.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.900
Okay. Look, don't take it personal.
We have been a little distracted.

12:14.984 --> 12:15.901
Distracted?

12:16.444 --> 12:18.946
That's an interesting term
for your selfishness.

12:19.029 --> 12:19.905
I'm not selfish.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.783
You nearly destroyed
the Knights of Saint Christopher

12:22.867 --> 12:24.118
and all we represent.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.911
And you two yaldsons stood by and let him.

12:26.328 --> 12:27.288
"Yaldsons"?

12:27.371 --> 12:30.499
That's an archaic term
for the son of a prostitute.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.251
Oh. Hey!

12:32.334 --> 12:33.210
Okay.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.045
What do you propose?

12:35.713 --> 12:38.048
Your wench apprised me
of Timber's predicament.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.468
Uh, that wench has a name.

12:41.635 --> 12:42.845
We retrieve our comrade,

12:42.928 --> 12:44.346
and we set things right.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.681
Damn.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.058
The new werewolf came to slay.

12:49.226 --> 12:50.144
Okay.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.445
Thank you, Algernon.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.281
I can pour the blood,

13:02.364 --> 13:05.326
but the four of you need to perform
the chant, or the incantation won't work.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.455
-Ready?
-Yeah, just watch out for my sneakers.

13:10.915 --> 13:11.832
On three.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.210
One...

13:15.920 --> 13:16.962
two...

13:17.630 --> 13:18.464
three.

13:34.438 --> 13:36.190
-Okay, try again.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.208
It's not working. Why isn't it working?

13:54.291 --> 13:55.292
I don't know.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.585
We did everything right.

13:58.879 --> 13:59.755
Everybody out!

13:59.839 --> 14:00.756
Go! Go! Go!

14:16.730 --> 14:17.815
Maybe it was a dud.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.025
That was a Tartarus eruption.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.360
It did something.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.333
Um...

14:36.417 --> 14:41.088
Does anyone remember there
being a vortex inside this thing?

14:45.634 --> 14:46.886
It smells like demon.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.013
Then the spell worked.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.223
Whoa. That's a portal to the demon realm,

14:51.307 --> 14:53.183
but we have no idea
where it's gonna take you.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.268
Hamish is right.

14:54.351 --> 14:57.271
The incantation is supposed
to take you directly to Lilith.

15:02.943 --> 15:03.861
That's not good.

15:03.944 --> 15:06.447
The hide locker's the only tether
we have to Lilith.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.575
We need to complete that spell
before that vortex sucks it away.

15:09.658 --> 15:12.036
We can't do anything
until we figure out where we went wrong.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.746
The only person
that did anything wrong is me.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.497
I never should have suggested that heist.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.124
Hey, we all agreed to it.

15:17.207 --> 15:20.044
Vera is the only person
with the power to rescue Lilith.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.463
Vera? No. No way.

15:22.546 --> 15:25.174
What if she says no?
What if she takes away the lockers?

15:25.257 --> 15:27.009
-She won't.
-You don't know that.

15:27.092 --> 15:27.968
Actually, I do.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.261
There is another option.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.139
Are you serious?
After what happened at the gallery?

15:32.222 --> 15:33.891
Look, I have to try. This is my fault.

15:34.224 --> 15:36.310
Gabrielle? What do you think?

15:37.478 --> 15:38.771
I think you're all pathetic.

15:38.854 --> 15:39.855
Cool, good talk.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.024
Last time I checked,
this wasn't a democracy.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.610
I'm going to go get Vera.
You guys, stay here.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.825
I'll work on the incantation.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.665
I'll, uh, secure the locker.

16:03.462 --> 16:04.922
Fuck this.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.425
Classic Silverback.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.521
I thought the <i>respondeos</i>
had lost their efficacy.

16:20.604 --> 16:24.650
Actually, we've been preparing
for the<i> Obcidione Caedo.</i>

16:24.733 --> 16:26.193
You're going through with it.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.947
Miss Drake has left me no choice.

16:30.739 --> 16:33.575
You would know this if you were here,
as ordered.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.244
I got tied up on something.

16:36.453 --> 16:39.456
Something more important
than defeating Praxis?

16:39.540 --> 16:40.791
Actually, yes.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.209
Would you like a drink?

16:42.710 --> 16:43.794
I'm awake, aren't I?

16:50.509 --> 16:51.510
The eruption...

16:52.386 --> 16:53.679
at Praxis headquarters.

16:55.806 --> 16:56.724
That was you.

16:58.642 --> 16:59.727
You killed Bennett.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.150
Council wouldn't listen to reason.

17:07.735 --> 17:09.486
So I gave them fear.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.282
Stopping Praxis is the only way
to stop these eruptions.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.325
Or is it the only option you'll consider?

17:17.244 --> 17:19.538
They're asking for something
I can't give them.

17:19.621 --> 17:20.497
Or won't?

17:23.584 --> 17:26.045
Look, I don't have time
for a game of Moral High Ground.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.796
Why don't you just tell me what you want?

17:28.547 --> 17:30.841
We need to rescue Lilith. Now.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.261
What did you idiots do?

17:35.262 --> 17:37.222
We attempted a rescue ourselves.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.348
Something went wrong.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.476
And you caused an eruption.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.228
You know how dangerous
these things get.

17:43.312 --> 17:46.398
I don't need my own people
helping along the apocalypse.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.109
We're close to critical mass as it is,
thanks to Alyssa Drake.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.153
-You're welcome.

18:06.293 --> 18:07.961
I told you this wasn't over.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.640
You know what I want.

19:04.893 --> 19:05.894
Go to Hell.

19:07.604 --> 19:08.605
You first.

19:40.512 --> 19:43.724
I'm gonna tear your soul apart.

19:43.807 --> 19:47.477
Great.
Uh, hey, do you know Lilith Bathory?

19:47.561 --> 19:48.770
Typical human.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.315
Of course, I'm from down there
so I know everybody.

19:51.398 --> 19:53.525
Never mind.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.196
What the hell was that?

19:57.279 --> 19:59.156
It's another soldier demon.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.824
-Another one?

20:00.908 --> 20:02.659
When did demons start coming up?

20:02.743 --> 20:04.995
Uh, about...

20:05.078 --> 20:06.705
...three demons ago.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.375
Thought it couldn't get any worse.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.419
Of course it could, and of course it did.

20:12.502 --> 20:13.837
And of course it's my fault.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.255
Hey, hey, come on.

20:15.339 --> 20:20.594
Yes, things are really, really,
really, really, really, really bad,

20:20.677 --> 20:22.429
but they're not terrible.

20:22.512 --> 20:25.265
I translated the incantation
using medieval Latin.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.309
I should have used Hiberno-Latin.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.478
Honestly,
I can see you making that mistake.

20:29.978 --> 20:30.854
D-- Randall!

20:31.396 --> 20:34.274
The owl we sacrificed
wasn't supposed to be an owl.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.859
It was supposed to be a witch.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.654
A witch? Like, a real witch?

20:39.029 --> 20:40.906
Like, a practitioner? That can't be right.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.783
This is the only way to rescue Lilith.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.702
We need to give a magical life
to get one back.

20:48.121 --> 20:50.582
Have you learned nothing
from your past mistakes?

20:50.666 --> 20:52.042
What is your problem, Gabrielle?

20:52.125 --> 20:53.961
You. This is all your fault.

20:54.044 --> 20:54.920
I know that.

20:55.003 --> 20:57.339
You should have listened to Midnight
when you had the chance.

20:57.422 --> 21:00.133
Yeah, he had great advice.
"Kill them all, burn them to the ground."

21:00.550 --> 21:02.302
At least you would have known victory.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.762
Instead, what did you do?

21:04.179 --> 21:05.305
A robbery.

21:05.514 --> 21:08.517
A pathetic half-measure, doomed to fail.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.060
What did I always tell you?

21:11.270 --> 21:12.187
Snap and shine?

21:12.521 --> 21:15.315
Strike first, strike fast, no prisoners.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.234
You'd better watch that hide, Gabrielle.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.444
Midnight can be a real mean bastard
when he wants to.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.906
And Silverback has always let
his emotions dictate his actions.

21:23.240 --> 21:27.536
You can't stop the chaos he causes,
but you can accept responsibility.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.205
Surrender his hide.

21:30.497 --> 21:32.791
Stop him from doing any more damage.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.961
Are you suggesting that I kill myself?
Are you serious?

21:37.004 --> 21:40.007
Your death would be a noble sacrifice.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.384
It's not going to happen.

21:42.467 --> 21:43.719
We'll see about that.

21:52.936 --> 21:54.479
What the hell?

22:03.322 --> 22:04.239
Vera?

22:04.948 --> 22:06.950
Thank God. I thought she'd kill you.

22:09.202 --> 22:11.079
Oh, it's far worse than that.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.427
She took your magic?

22:28.221 --> 22:30.223
She's holding it hostage...

22:31.975 --> 22:35.645
until I give her the <i>Fors Factoram.</i>

22:36.104 --> 22:38.273
Devil's advocate. Give it to her.

22:40.817 --> 22:43.070
No, it's far too dangerous.

22:45.113 --> 22:48.158
That incantation turns you...

22:49.534 --> 22:51.244
into the sacrifice.

22:51.912 --> 22:52.829
So...

22:53.622 --> 22:58.210
while you enjoy the pleasure
of easy incantations,

22:58.293 --> 23:02.631
a magic cancer slowly eats you alive.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.593
It may kill you in years...

23:08.845 --> 23:10.013
or months.

23:10.931 --> 23:14.059
But if you give it to them,
the eruptions stop,

23:14.142 --> 23:16.436
and Praxis wipes themselves out.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.231
I'd only be paving the way
for a different kind of chaos.

23:19.314 --> 23:20.816
At least you'd have your magic back.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.275
Please.

23:24.945 --> 23:27.572
She has no intention of giving it back.

23:31.034 --> 23:32.869
I imagine she...

23:34.955 --> 23:39.084
like you, finds me a selfish woman.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.381
Vera, I don't think you're selfish.

23:44.464 --> 23:47.676
You're demanding and weirdly ticklish,

23:47.759 --> 23:49.761
but not selfish.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.222
How can you be so sure?

23:52.305 --> 23:54.891
Because of all the times
you could have killed us,

23:54.975 --> 23:58.186
but you didn't because
you wanted us to learn, to live.

24:01.189 --> 24:02.065
Don't.

24:04.317 --> 24:07.028
It's all right to let someone
care about you.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.535
There's no point.

24:18.206 --> 24:20.917
You performed the <i>Fors Factoram?</i>

24:30.385 --> 24:32.053
All right, yeah,
I'll catch up later.

24:32.137 --> 24:32.971
Gabrielle.

24:34.806 --> 24:35.640
Gabrielle!

24:35.724 --> 24:37.142
I'll be there in a minute.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.146
-Jack! You're in danger.
-We're all in danger.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.190
No, you idiot. Midnight wants to--

24:48.820 --> 24:51.198
-I will not be denied!
-Denied what, Midnight?

24:51.656 --> 24:53.366
You're smarter than you look, Jack Morton.

24:53.450 --> 24:56.036
And you're a Knight that wants to kill
another Knight. Not exactly noble.

24:56.119 --> 24:59.748
The most selfish werewolf in the pack
preaches to me about nobility?

24:59.831 --> 25:02.918
If you were truly noble,
you'd kill yourself before it's too late.

25:07.005 --> 25:07.964
Too late.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.551
You've finally done it, Silverback.

25:11.635 --> 25:14.387
The world is doomed, and so are you.

25:15.430 --> 25:16.890
<i>There's a way to fix this.</i>

25:16.973 --> 25:18.141
You're right. There is.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.268
We find Alyssa Drake and eat her heart.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.854
Vera gets her power back
and she can use it to mend the eruption.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.273
-And Alyssa's dead.
-And the Order is back in power.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.943
At least the Order's trying to stop
the magic apocalypse.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.194
Yeah, this time.

25:29.277 --> 25:32.447
It doesn't matter if we're the Knights
of the Blue Rose or Saint Christopher.

25:32.531 --> 25:35.200
Our job remains the same,
keeping the Order in check.

25:35.283 --> 25:38.787
That Tartarus eruption is
as much Vera's fault as it is Alyssa's.

25:38.870 --> 25:41.665
Okay? They both need to be
held accountable for it.

25:41.748 --> 25:45.168
They're also the only practitioners
that are capable of dealing with it.

25:45.252 --> 25:46.753
Well, look who showed up.

25:47.295 --> 25:48.463
An actual Knight.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.383
Where exactly is the real Gabrielle?

25:52.217 --> 25:53.343
Is she okay?

25:53.760 --> 25:54.719
Did she ask about me?

25:54.803 --> 25:56.513
-Oh! Fuck.

25:56.596 --> 25:57.764
Vera has the knowledge,

25:57.847 --> 26:00.308
Alyssa has the power.
We have to convince them to work together.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.351
That's your plan?

26:01.434 --> 26:02.435
You have a better idea?

26:04.020 --> 26:06.398
No. Actually, it's a good one.

26:07.941 --> 26:09.359
-Thanks.
-Still gonna kill you.

26:09.442 --> 26:10.485
Yeah, I got it.

26:11.319 --> 26:14.531
Alyssa won't lift a finger unless
Vera gives her the<i> Fors Factoram,</i>

26:14.614 --> 26:15.991
and that's not gonna happen.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.077
The world is on the brink of destruction,

26:19.160 --> 26:21.955
and you're letting people's feelings
dictate your actions?

26:22.038 --> 26:25.041
None of you are fit to carry my shield,
let alone fight alongside me.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.586
Here's what we're going to do,
plague sores.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.589
Is "plague sores" the plan?

26:30.672 --> 26:32.173
I think she means it as an insult.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.717
We're going with Silverback's plan.

26:34.301 --> 26:37.345
We get the witches
to fix the eruption together.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.889
I already tried to convince Vera.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.975
For God's sake, we're werewolves.

26:42.392 --> 26:43.935
We tell people what to do.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.395
Yeah, Hamish, you're...

26:46.438 --> 26:49.441
-You're talking to Hamish, right?
-I'm talking to all of you.

26:49.649 --> 26:51.443
Stop being so damned human.

26:51.526 --> 26:54.487
-It's embarrassing.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.537
Whatever we're going to do,
we better do it fast.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.667
What you're proposing is impossible.

27:07.751 --> 27:10.462
Then you didn't hear me correctly.
It's not a proposal.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.049
Watch your tone, disciple.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.550
I won't be powerless forever.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.926
No, you'll be dead.

27:17.385 --> 27:18.887
Do you want to take that risk?

27:19.387 --> 27:20.555
'Cause I don't.

27:21.931 --> 27:24.726
What I want is my magic back.

27:30.106 --> 27:33.485
And I'd still have it if you werewolves
had done what you were told.

27:34.819 --> 27:35.737
Get out.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.795
Make the arrangements.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.425
Yes.

28:32.836 --> 28:33.837
...Alyssa Drake.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.222
-You gotta be kidding me.

28:47.016 --> 28:47.892
Alyssa?

28:50.812 --> 28:52.522
Took you long enough to get here.

28:53.732 --> 28:54.858
You knew I was coming?

28:54.941 --> 28:56.609
Salvador taught me some tricks.

28:57.444 --> 28:58.987
Vera ready to cooperate?

28:59.070 --> 29:03.032
She will give you the <i>Fors Factoram</i>
after you help her seal the eruption.

29:04.451 --> 29:05.410
Before.

29:06.286 --> 29:07.120
I'll tell them.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.206
You know, everyone else thought that

29:10.290 --> 29:12.751
taking Vera's magic
was a straight revenge play.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.794
We're not interested in revenge.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.338
I wasn't talking about Praxis.

29:20.133 --> 29:21.217
Is there anything else?

29:22.427 --> 29:24.512
Not unless you want to tell me

29:25.054 --> 29:26.723
where Alpha's hide locker is.

29:26.806 --> 29:30.018
It's somewhere safe,
waiting for an appropriate champion.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.144
So not you?

29:34.606 --> 29:35.440
We should go.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.525
That eruption isn't gonna seal itself.

29:37.609 --> 29:38.818
Hey, hey.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.781
I'm sorry about Salvador.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.369
I don't blame you.

29:50.413 --> 29:52.582
But I'm not ready to forgive you, either.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.251
When you are, tell me what to do.
I'll do it.

29:55.335 --> 29:56.669
Just stop talking, okay?

29:56.753 --> 29:57.879
I need you to understand--

29:57.962 --> 29:59.923
I understand, I do.

30:00.006 --> 30:03.092
But I need you to understand that
I really want to hate you right now,

30:03.176 --> 30:04.844
and you're making it kind of hard.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.556
You know, a part of me wishes
that eruption would do its worst...

30:09.849 --> 30:11.643
and the rest of the world
would just disappear.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.104
And then it would just be you...

30:16.606 --> 30:17.440
and me...

30:18.441 --> 30:20.860
in this overpriced hotel room...

30:22.320 --> 30:23.905
for the rest of our lives.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.035
You need to be careful what you wish for.

30:32.747 --> 30:33.748
Time to go.

30:59.524 --> 31:00.400
Nicole?

31:00.900 --> 31:01.734
Another demon?

31:02.235 --> 31:03.903
Jack and Alyssa are heading to the temple,

31:03.987 --> 31:06.030
and Hamish texted that Vera is on board.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.448
This is it.

31:07.532 --> 31:08.825
We're gonna get her back.

31:11.327 --> 31:12.161
How?

31:13.454 --> 31:15.623
We can't kill anyone.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.333
This is our only chance.

31:18.334 --> 31:19.335
Then it should be me.

31:20.044 --> 31:22.589
That's all there is to it.
I'm a witch, so kill me.

31:22.672 --> 31:23.965
No, it's not gonna be you.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.342
Well, it can't be you.
We need you for the incantation,

31:26.426 --> 31:28.887
and we have no right to place
this judgment over anyone else.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.722
Nicole, if I sacrifice you,

31:30.805 --> 31:32.140
Lilith will kill me.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.058
I'm the only logical choice.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.394
-Nicole...
-When the Order invited me to join,

31:36.477 --> 31:39.314
all I could think about was
all the good I'd do with magic.

31:40.023 --> 31:42.483
You know the most altruistic thing
I've ever done?

31:43.526 --> 31:44.444
Fix someone's car.

31:44.527 --> 31:46.446
-Nicole...
-We can't leave her there.

31:47.697 --> 31:50.283
And I can't live with
that kind of blood on my hands.

31:52.869 --> 31:53.912
You won't have to.

31:57.916 --> 31:58.875
Okay.

32:03.338 --> 32:04.547
Your name is Nicole Birch.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.425
You're a student at Belgrave
and a member of the Order.

32:07.842 --> 32:09.928
You mistranslated the incantation.

32:10.011 --> 32:11.971
The sacrifice needs to be two owls.

32:14.515 --> 32:15.975
I figured out my mistake.

32:16.893 --> 32:17.894
Uh...

32:18.436 --> 32:20.229
It's supposed to be two owls,
not just one.

32:21.648 --> 32:24.359
-Did I fall asleep?
-Yeah, you did.

32:24.442 --> 32:25.610
And we're going ahead.

32:26.819 --> 32:28.863
Vera and Alyssa are on board.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.574
It's really happening.

32:31.658 --> 32:32.492
I'm on it.

32:32.575 --> 32:34.827
You stay here
and keep an eye on the locker.

32:34.911 --> 32:36.663
We don't want any more demons
getting through.

32:36.746 --> 32:38.373
-But--
-It's really easy.

32:38.456 --> 32:41.209
These are all lower-caste demons
we're dealing with.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.795
The second they pop out, you swing.

33:11.739 --> 33:12.824
What's he doing here?

33:13.199 --> 33:14.325
We're not staying.

33:14.409 --> 33:15.535
Yes, we are.

33:15.618 --> 33:16.953
No, you're not.

33:18.454 --> 33:19.706
It's not safe.

33:20.331 --> 33:21.708
I'm no threat to her.

33:21.791 --> 33:22.875
Not anymore.

33:38.474 --> 33:39.517
Is this it?

33:40.268 --> 33:41.686
<i>Fors Factoram.</i>

33:49.193 --> 33:51.112
Congratulations, Miss Drake.

33:52.030 --> 33:52.947
You now possess

33:53.031 --> 33:56.159
two of the most powerful incantations
ever created,

33:56.701 --> 34:00.204
and I pray you never complete either one.

34:07.253 --> 34:08.129
Please.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.547
I am begging you.

34:10.923 --> 34:14.052
The <i>Fors Factoram</i> is dangerous.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.637
Only Magus-level practitioners
get to see it,

34:16.721 --> 34:19.640
and fewer still ever elect to use it.

34:19.724 --> 34:20.683
Until now.

34:22.435 --> 34:24.771
You know what this incantation does?

34:24.854 --> 34:26.147
Yes, Vera.

34:26.856 --> 34:29.942
It frees a practitioner from sacrifices.

34:33.154 --> 34:36.365
Nothing frees practitioners
from sacrifice.

34:36.824 --> 34:37.742
You pay now,

34:38.117 --> 34:39.452
or you pay later.

34:40.787 --> 34:43.706
Later costs more.

34:49.670 --> 34:50.838
Let's finish this.

35:02.141 --> 35:03.476
Maddox, let's go.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.066
I hate fencing.

35:10.149 --> 35:12.360
Really? I would have never guessed.

35:12.568 --> 35:15.196
It's not like you say that
after every single class.

35:15.279 --> 35:16.322
I wanna quit.

35:17.323 --> 35:20.660
Well, you can't.
Your dad left very clear instructions.

35:21.035 --> 35:22.161
When is Dad getting home?

35:22.245 --> 35:23.955
I keep telling you he'll be home soon.

35:24.038 --> 35:24.956
Now get in.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.543
Fucking kids.

35:42.765 --> 35:43.766
Aunt Bitsy?

35:52.441 --> 35:53.359
Aunt Bitsy?

35:59.949 --> 36:00.950
Aunt Bitsy?

36:08.875 --> 36:10.793
For this incantation to work...

36:11.627 --> 36:15.715
you have to aim the knife at the eruption
and speak the incantation.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.264
No, listen.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.068
Good.

36:39.405 --> 36:41.490
And then you'll slice your palm,

36:42.325 --> 36:44.035
and place your hand on the loom.

36:49.999 --> 36:51.167
That's it?

36:52.919 --> 36:53.836
That's it.

36:55.963 --> 36:56.797
I have to say

36:56.881 --> 36:59.508
I think I'm finally impressed with you,
Miss Drake.

36:59.592 --> 37:03.846
You brought us to the brink of destruction
for a single incantation.

37:05.890 --> 37:08.142
It was never about
a single incantation, Vera.

37:08.643 --> 37:11.604
The <i>Fors Factoram</i> will help us realize
Salvador's dream.

37:12.438 --> 37:15.441
Yes, a world full of magic and wonder.

37:15.524 --> 37:18.361
Now, why hasn't anyone
ever thought of that before?

37:18.444 --> 37:19.820
Oh, that's right.

37:20.279 --> 37:21.447
They have.

37:36.504 --> 37:37.338
What now?

37:38.005 --> 37:41.008
Pray the loom works
faster than the eruption.

37:46.806 --> 37:48.641
Guys, they've activated the loom.

37:49.225 --> 37:50.226
Nicole?

37:51.644 --> 37:52.478
We're ready.

37:52.979 --> 37:55.231
Seems like a lot of blood for two owls.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.568
Randall, how many owls did you kill?

37:59.652 --> 38:01.487
I needed to make sure
the spell worked, okay?

38:01.570 --> 38:03.572
-Dude--
-We're not talking about this.

38:09.537 --> 38:10.371
Okay.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.925
If I don't make it back,

38:23.009 --> 38:24.093
don't touch my stuff.

38:51.746 --> 38:53.664
If this doesn't work,
their blood is on your hands.

38:53.748 --> 38:54.582
It's gonna work.

38:54.665 --> 38:57.418
Last time one of Silverback's
other champions said that to me,

38:57.501 --> 38:58.627
we were betrayed.

38:58.711 --> 38:59.879
Then take it up with that guy.

38:59.962 --> 39:01.756
-One day's heroism...
-Guys, the ropes.

39:01.839 --> 39:05.092
...isn't going to overcome
decades of selfishness, Silverback.

39:05.176 --> 39:08.387
I'm not my hide,
and I'm not your history, Midnight.

39:08.471 --> 39:09.513
-Midnight's a zealot.
-Guys!

39:09.597 --> 39:12.058
Yeah, and still pissed off at me
for breaking up with him.

39:12.141 --> 39:13.601
None of this is personal.

39:13.684 --> 39:16.312
Your first duty as a Knight
is to your mission--

39:16.395 --> 39:17.480
Shut up and start pulling!

39:23.986 --> 39:24.987
Randall, is that you?

39:25.571 --> 39:26.405
Oh, it's Randall!

39:26.489 --> 39:28.616
Guys, on three. One, two, three!

39:34.372 --> 39:37.249
There's no such thing as easy magic!

39:37.333 --> 39:39.126
Seriously? Right now?

39:39.210 --> 39:44.256
The second you complete the <i>Fors Factoram,</i>
your life begins stripping away from you.

39:44.340 --> 39:47.343
That doesn't give you
the right to keep it from us.

40:01.649 --> 40:02.650
Lilith.

40:05.277 --> 40:07.738
So, that was hell.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.365
It wasn't Hell.

40:10.074 --> 40:12.576
It was a trans-dimensional plane.

40:13.327 --> 40:15.496
I was talking about the experience.

40:16.205 --> 40:18.165
- Portal seems to be closed.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.292
I think we're gonna be okay.

40:21.001 --> 40:21.961
You seeing this?

40:22.044 --> 40:23.671
Yeah. We got bigger things to worry about.

40:26.715 --> 40:28.092
It's really good to see you.

40:28.592 --> 40:29.718
We missed you so much.

40:30.511 --> 40:32.096
We're gonna give you guys a minute.

40:32.179 --> 40:33.264
You would not believe

40:33.347 --> 40:35.975
how many incantations we attempted
to bring you home.

40:37.059 --> 40:37.935
Home?

40:41.188 --> 40:42.815
This isn't my home.

40:44.108 --> 40:46.068
You took me from my home.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.947
And you need to send me back.

40:59.748 --> 41:00.708
You did it.

41:02.001 --> 41:02.877
We did it.

41:05.004 --> 41:07.339
-So, Midnight...

41:08.799 --> 41:10.509
the apocalypse was averted.

41:11.010 --> 41:11.886
Lilith's back.

41:11.969 --> 41:13.053
What's it going to be?

41:13.345 --> 41:17.349
I can't decide if you're the worst
champion Silverback has selected,

41:17.433 --> 41:18.309
or the best.

41:19.852 --> 41:20.769
I'll let you live.

41:21.145 --> 41:21.979
For now.

41:22.062 --> 41:23.314
That's a relief.

41:26.567 --> 41:27.443
Dude.

41:27.526 --> 41:28.611
Midnight may let me live,

41:28.694 --> 41:30.821
-but no way he'll let Vera and Alyssa go.
-What?

41:30.905 --> 41:34.450
Midnight only agreed to my plan because
it puts Vera and Alyssa in the same room.

41:40.831 --> 41:42.333
And here we are.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.585
The eruption is sealed,

41:45.127 --> 41:47.630
and your plan will fail.

41:49.715 --> 41:50.716
Time will tell.

41:50.799 --> 41:53.219
It already has.

41:53.719 --> 41:55.554
Several times.

42:01.477 --> 42:02.311
Well...

42:03.312 --> 42:05.856
if you're going to kill me, Miss Drake...

42:10.069 --> 42:11.195
Just not the face.

42:16.033 --> 42:17.993
You deserve to die for what you did.

42:18.077 --> 42:19.828
For saving the world?

42:20.412 --> 42:23.290
Please. You saw
what those eruptions can do.

42:24.583 --> 42:27.378
And if Salvador was
any kind of a real leader,

42:28.045 --> 42:29.588
she would have done the same.

42:29.672 --> 42:33.425
Salvador was a greater leader
than you ever were.

42:34.301 --> 42:35.386
Alyssa, don't.

42:40.808 --> 42:42.434
Revenge is never worth the cost.

42:43.435 --> 42:44.812
You're the one that taught me that.

42:45.437 --> 42:46.605
This isn't revenge.

42:46.689 --> 42:48.315
-This is justice.
-No.

42:49.149 --> 42:50.526
It's revenge.

42:50.609 --> 42:51.485
This is anger.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.572
Alyssa, I know because I've been there.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.200
Don't make the mistake
you stopped me from making.

42:58.284 --> 43:01.328
After everything she's done,
she doesn't deserve to live.

43:03.872 --> 43:05.082
Well, then neither do I.

43:06.417 --> 43:07.876
If all this is anyone's fault,

43:08.377 --> 43:09.253
it's mine.

43:10.838 --> 43:13.882
And if you have to kill someone
to feel better, make it me.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.387
Because once you kill Vera,
the Order targets you.

43:20.222 --> 43:23.350
And I can't live in a world
without you in it.

43:27.980 --> 43:30.149
it's always about you, isn't it?

43:30.941 --> 43:32.818
I like being the center of attention.

43:40.451 --> 43:41.827
Alyssa, you have to go now.

43:43.120 --> 43:46.332
All right? Gabrielle is possessed
by Midnight, and as far as he's concerned,

43:46.415 --> 43:47.708
you're both the enemy.

43:48.500 --> 43:50.169
Return my magic.

43:50.252 --> 43:51.253
Not going to happen.

43:55.007 --> 43:55.966
Go.

44:05.392 --> 44:06.268
Goodbye, Jack.

44:20.824 --> 44:22.159
-No!

44:37.174 --> 44:39.218
-Alyssa. Alyssa.

44:39.927 --> 44:40.928
Vera, help her.

44:42.554 --> 44:44.264
-I-- I can't, I don't--
-Please.

44:45.265 --> 44:47.476
Alyssa, you have to return Vera's magic.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.061
Alyssa?

44:49.645 --> 44:51.397
Alyssa, you have to return her magic.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.148
No. Alyssa!

44:55.818 --> 44:57.736
No. No.
