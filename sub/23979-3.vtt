"Life Sentence"...

00:02.969 --> 00:04.529
Stella: Sure, I married a guy
I barely knew,

00:04.570 --> 00:05.765
but I had cancer.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.734
It was a six-to-eight month
commitment, tops.

00:07.770 --> 00:09.033
I'm cured.

00:09.070 --> 00:10.367
My cancer was gone

00:10.410 --> 00:12.538
and the eight years my family
spent taking care of me

00:12.580 --> 00:14.469
had kind of ruined
their lives.

00:14.510 --> 00:15.204
Mom just left Dad.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.174
I thought
I made you happy.

00:17.210 --> 00:18.678
You did, Peter.
A long time ago.

00:18.710 --> 00:21.714
We have to sell the house
and work until we're 80.

00:21.750 --> 00:23.718
If we sell the house,
where am I going to live?!

00:23.750 --> 00:26.219
I help Lizzie
get into a writers' retreat

00:26.260 --> 00:27.113
so she could finally focus.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.128
Diego: See you, babe!
I got the kids!

00:29.160 --> 00:31.128
You know I'm gonna kill
you, right? Makes sense.

Sadie:
Um, I don't think patients

00:32.330 --> 00:34.253

to drink wine.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.189

this was my room.

newest volunteer,

00:45.470 --> 00:47.837
I vowed to make a big
difference in patients' lives

nail polish tomorrow?

00:55.850 --> 00:57.579
Absolutely.

00:58.750 --> 01:01.390
Oh, so, Jill, hi.

01:01.420 --> 01:04.253
Uh, I was just wondering
if maybe I could have

01:04.290 --> 01:06.122
a little more responsibility
around here.

What is happening? Is
there an emergency? No.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.663
There's a new oncologist
on the floor,

01:15.700 --> 01:16.804

01:16.840 --> 01:18.535
Okay. Well, back to me.

01:18.570 --> 01:20.208
I was just asking
if I could be

01:20.240 --> 01:21.173
a little more hands-on
with the patients.

my dad was struggling

01:28.880 --> 01:30.518
to get used to life
in the guest house

01:30.550 --> 01:32.757
after the new owners agreed
to let him stay.

01:32.790 --> 01:35.418
Unfortunately,
it came with a roommate.

Aiden: Again?

01:39.300 --> 01:40.790
I asked you
not to stand there.

01:40.830 --> 01:42.764
And I asked you to use
the bathroom sink.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.293
That's 23 steps away
and 18 of those are stairs.

to get someone
to watch his kids,

02:03.320 --> 02:04.742

I could catch you here.

02:10.930 --> 02:12.898
Did she?
Thanks, Poppy.

02:12.930 --> 02:15.149
I could really use some help
with the kids tomorrow night.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.362
Oh, Diego.
I love those kids.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.199
They are the pride and joy

And besides,

08:06.780 --> 08:08.874
Aiden, Dad let you
move in with him for free,

08:08.920 --> 08:11.116
and he's always
been there for you,

08:11.150 --> 08:14.211
so I think it's your turn
to be there for him.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.888
Okay,
I'm gonna do it.

08:16.930 --> 08:20.525
I'm gonna hang out with
my own father on purpose,

08:20.560 --> 08:22.255
like an adult.
Great.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.563
Can I still borrow
that cash?

08:23.600 --> 08:26.661
<i>* Xk</i>

08:26.700 --> 08:28.566
-Uncle Wes!
-Hey!

08:28.600 --> 08:30.637
Yeah! Unh!

08:30.670 --> 08:31.660
I brought a few things.

08:31.710 --> 08:33.075
Oh, you did
You got that?

08:33.110 --> 08:34.839
Yep, that's it, then.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.575
No, not quite.
Just got a couple more bags.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.245
It is still just
the one night, right?

08:40.280 --> 08:42.145
Yeah, totally.
Okay.

08:42.179 --> 08:44.649
Um, okay, so, uh,
the kid toothpaste --

08:44.690 --> 08:46.010
it's somewhere in there.

08:46.050 --> 08:47.586
And, uh,
it doesn't really matter

08:47.620 --> 08:48.587
'cause their teeth
are gonna fall out anyways.

08:48.620 --> 08:49.655
But...

08:49.690 --> 08:51.624
Are you good?
Great. Got it.

08:51.660 --> 08:52.821
Hey, I really
appreciate this, man.

08:52.860 --> 08:54.726
I've been leaning on Mom
a lot lately, so --

08:54.760 --> 08:55.693
Wait, wait.
You call Ida "Mom"?

08:55.730 --> 08:57.789
Yeah.
What do you call her?

08:57.830 --> 08:59.662
I generally avoid
calling her anything.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.566
I just don't really
have experience

09:01.600 --> 09:03.807
being around a mother
that's so maternal, you know.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.660
Ida's a hugger.
My mom was not.

09:05.710 --> 09:06.973
Your mom didn't hug you?

09:07.010 --> 09:08.705
Well, she patted me
on the back once,

09:08.740 --> 09:09.741
but I was on fire,

09:09.780 --> 09:11.270
so I can't be sure
that was genuine affection.

09:11.310 --> 09:12.709
Oh, well, hey.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.570
You got Ida now,
and she is great.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.576
Uh, by the way, my friend,

09:15.620 --> 09:17.748
you are gonna need this
for Miss Fiona tonight.

09:17.790 --> 09:18.882
Cool.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.289
I'm sure it's fine.

09:21.320 --> 09:22.719
Yeah, probably not,

09:22.760 --> 09:24.580
but, hey, I will pay for
whatever it is

09:24.630 --> 09:25.620
or whatever it was.

09:25.660 --> 09:27.321
Um, I got a four-hour drive

09:27.360 --> 09:28.828
and, uh,
24 hours on the ground

09:28.860 --> 09:29.964
before I have
to turn around.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.694
Not to worry.

09:30.730 --> 09:31.868
Stella's
gonna be home soon,

09:31.900 --> 09:33.664
so two of us,
two of them.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.635
Hey, seriously,
very thankful.

09:36.670 --> 09:38.206
Not a problem.

09:40.740 --> 09:43.778
Okay, who wants to play
a fun game called

09:43.810 --> 09:46.040
"sit still
and don't break anything"?

09:46.080 --> 09:51.917
<i>* Xk</i>

09:51.950 --> 09:53.816
Aah!

09:53.860 --> 09:55.350
I am sorry
I had to do that.

09:55.390 --> 09:56.858
But it's for your own good.

09:56.890 --> 09:58.358
You are obsessing
over the new owners.

09:58.390 --> 09:59.357
I am not obsessing.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.791
I'm checking to see
if they're still planning

10:01.830 --> 10:03.264
to remove that
Japanese maple tree.

10:03.300 --> 10:06.691
Your mom and I planted it
when we moved in.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.367
It looks great there.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.663
Mistake to move it!

10:09.710 --> 10:12.702
Dad, you have to move on.

10:12.740 --> 10:13.878
Mom has.

10:13.910 --> 10:15.173
So I'm taking you out
tonight.

10:15.210 --> 10:17.247
I don't want to go out.
We have to.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.645
Stella said so.

10:19.750 --> 10:20.945
Look, I told her about

10:20.980 --> 10:22.311
your whole "Rear Window"
situation,

10:22.350 --> 10:24.819
and she suggested that we go
and do something,

10:24.850 --> 10:26.215
just the two of us.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.718
And she's right.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.353
You got to stop clinging
to this old life.

10:29.390 --> 10:31.028
I'm not clinging.

10:31.060 --> 10:32.221
Oh, no.
I know you're not.

10:32.260 --> 10:33.398
I'm just curious. though.

10:33.430 --> 10:34.920
What color did they end up
going with in the living room?

10:34.960 --> 10:36.894
Like a beige,
but a yellow-beige.

10:36.930 --> 10:38.898
You can tell she liked it
better than he did.

10:38.930 --> 10:42.366
He just caved like a fool
and --

10:42.400 --> 10:44.232
Yeah, we should get me
out of here.

10:44.270 --> 10:49.845
<i>* Xk</i>

10:49.880 --> 10:50.870
I knew if I got caught

10:50.910 --> 10:52.378
breaking into
Ms. French's office,

10:52.410 --> 10:54.219
it would not be good.

10:57.820 --> 10:59.686
But I wasn't
going to get caught.

10:59.720 --> 11:04.681
<i>* Xk</i>

11:04.730 --> 11:07.153
Hey,
what are you doing in here?

11:07.200 --> 11:10.795
<i>* Xk</i>

11:13.870 --> 11:14.940
<i>* Xk</i>

11:14.970 --> 11:16.062
What are you doing in here?

11:16.100 --> 11:17.864
I'm here to see
Ms. French.

11:17.910 --> 11:19.366
Well, I'm here to...

11:20.340 --> 11:22.434
...steal confidential
patient information,

11:22.480 --> 11:23.402
but, to be fair,

11:23.450 --> 11:24.872
it is information about
the clinical trial

11:24.910 --> 11:26.173
that cured my cancer.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.918
I didn't know
you had cancer.

11:28.950 --> 11:30.145
I did.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.817
But it's gone now.

11:31.850 --> 11:33.784
So I need to know the name
of the anonymous donor

11:33.820 --> 11:35.117
who funded my trial.

11:35.160 --> 11:35.956
Why?

11:35.990 --> 11:37.879
Because he pulled
all the funding,

11:37.930 --> 11:39.250
and I need to ask him
to put it back in

11:39.290 --> 11:41.349
for Sadie.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.789
I'm living proof that
this trial is worth it.

11:43.830 --> 11:45.821
It literally saved my life,

11:45.870 --> 11:47.929
which is why I need
to get it started again.

11:47.970 --> 11:50.302
But this is crazy, Stella.

11:50.340 --> 11:51.899
I know it's a long shot,

11:51.940 --> 11:53.374
but I promised Sadie
that I would fight for her.

11:53.410 --> 11:55.833
And the only thing
standing in the way of that

11:55.880 --> 11:58.303
is this donor named...

11:58.350 --> 11:59.442
Roger Shaw.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.244
Roger Shaw?
He's the donor?

12:01.280 --> 12:03.510
Why, do you know him?
Well, kind of, yeah.

12:03.550 --> 12:04.585
He owns the 44 Park Hotel.

12:04.620 --> 12:06.281
Matter of fact, they're having
a party there tonight

12:06.320 --> 12:07.481
for the opening
of his new bar.

12:07.520 --> 12:08.783
So he'll be there.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.785
Can you introduce me?
No, I -- I feel like

12:11.830 --> 12:12.991
he kind of
wants to be anonymous.

12:13.030 --> 12:14.452
Why would he want
to be anonymous?

12:14.500 --> 12:16.355
So that people don't
ask him for money. Right.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.268
Well, what if I didn't
ask him directly?

12:20.870 --> 12:22.190
I feel like
you're plotting something.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.969
I am plotting something,

12:24.010 --> 12:26.069
and you are a part of it.

12:26.110 --> 12:27.805
<i>* Xk</i>

12:27.840 --> 12:30.002
-Oh.

have arrived!

12:31.980 --> 12:32.674

Uncle Wes, come back!

Quick, back in!

12:37.250 --> 12:38.945
Come on, grab a pillow
if you want to live.

12:38.990 --> 12:39.889
So, listen,

12:39.920 --> 12:42.890
I know we agreed
to watch the kids tonight.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.250
Um, did we
or did you volunteer us?

12:44.290 --> 12:45.883
I'd rather not get
caught up in semantics,

12:45.930 --> 12:49.025
because there is something
I really need to do tonight.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.165
Seriously? I know.
Terrible timing.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.838
But I'm trying
to get Sadie

12:52.870 --> 12:54.463
the same experimental
treatment I got.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.695
At 8:00 p.m.
on a Saturday?

12:55.740 --> 12:58.960
I know where the guy who
funded the trial is gonna be tonight

12:59.010 --> 13:01.377
and I need to talk to him
about funding another one.

13:01.410 --> 13:02.969
Stells?
Yeah?

13:03.010 --> 13:03.806
Are you sure about this?

13:03.850 --> 13:05.306
I mean,
you barely know this guy,

13:05.350 --> 13:06.840
and I don't want
you getting hurt

13:06.880 --> 13:08.041
in case
it doesn't work out.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.275
Wes,
I have to do more than

13:09.320 --> 13:10.947
just wipe the counters
at the hospital.

13:10.990 --> 13:13.550
I -- I want
to make a difference

13:13.590 --> 13:15.979
and this is how I can help.

13:16.020 --> 13:17.522
Okay.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.925
I can handle
the kids on my own.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.849
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.267
You know, I think this
might be the first time

13:24.300 --> 13:26.064
either one of us has gone out
without the other one.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.966

You look --

13:36.010 --> 13:37.500
having a little trouble
understanding

13:37.550 --> 13:39.507
why you need to look like that

into a disco after 10:007?

I am not
going to the hospital.

Oh, okay.
Mm-hmm.

13:47.060 --> 13:47.982
Why do you have to go alone?

13:48.020 --> 13:49.215
Nope, not going alone.

Sadie's new doctor
knows this guy,

13:51.060 --> 13:52.130
so he's coming
to introduce me.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.925
He's go

Wait, so, you're going
to a hotel,

13:57.030 --> 13:58.293

Come on, Dad.
We got to go.

14:33.370 --> 14:34.565
And now, I have to stop.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.670
What

14:35.700 --> 14:36.929
Because we're
going to a bar,

14:36.970 --> 14:38.040
not small-claims court.

14:38.070 --> 14:41.279
You know,
just leave you here

14:41.310 --> 14:42.675
so that you can tie it
on a door handle

14:42.710 --> 14:43.871
when you have company later.

14:43.910 --> 14:46.948
In fact, we should probably
figure out the architecture

14:46.980 --> 14:48.539
for when we both
have company,

14:48.580 --> 14:52.016
the basic floor plan
for that inevitable scenario.

14:52.050 --> 14:53.415
I wouldn't worry
about it.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.088
I haven't had company like that
in a long time.

14:56.120 --> 14:57.588

I'm gonna need you

14:57.630 --> 15:00.349
to take that ring off.

15:03.030 --> 15:05.362
It feels too weird
not to have it on.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.936
How about this?

15:08.140 --> 15:08.834
It's a start.

15:08.870 --> 15:10.964
Maybe I'm not ready
to date.

15:11.010 --> 15:14.002
Whoa, who said anything
about dating?

15:14.040 --> 15:15.633
We're talking
about casual sex

15:15.680 --> 15:18.069
for morale purposes
only.

15:18.110 --> 15:20.442
Dad, I'm gonna be
your wingman tonight.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.086
I'm gonna teach you
everything I know.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.212
Not to brag,

15:24.250 --> 15:26.218
but I have an almost 100 percent
success rate with women.

definition of bragging.

15:58.490 --> 16:01.187
I think I'm gonna
throw up. N-n-no, no.

16:01.220 --> 16:03.029
Sweetheart, listen, um,
here's the deal. Wait.

16:03.060 --> 16:03.856
What's going on?

16:03.890 --> 16:06.154
If you throw up,
I throw up, okay?

16:06.190 --> 16:07.555
Uncle Wes doesn't want
to throw up,

16:07.600 --> 16:09.056
so please...

16:10.170 --> 16:13.037
I know exactly
what you should do.

16:13.070 --> 16:15.698
I brought two thermometers,
tummy bear, ginger --

16:15.740 --> 16:17.105
just in case
she pukes again.

16:17.140 --> 16:18.562
Frank, go get a bucket.

16:18.610 --> 16:20.032
Fiona, honey,

16:20.080 --> 16:21.605
I need you
to take this probiotic.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.199
It's delish.
Drink up.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.708
Don't worry, Wes.
Mom's here.

16:25.750 --> 16:27.343
Everything's under control.

16:27.380 --> 16:29.178

16:29.220 --> 16:30.244
Fiona:

16:36.820 --> 16:42.259
<i>* Xk</i>

16:42.300 --> 16:44.268
Four scotch and sodas,
please.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.519
It's happy hour so we buy
all of our drinks now.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.163
I feel like
that's self-explanatory,

16:48.200 --> 16:50.669
but I'm not entirely sure
what you do and do not know.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.303
Well, I know that we are not
buying the drinks,

16:52.340 --> 16:54.172
because that was
my credit card.

16:54.210 --> 16:57.100
I will get the next round.

16:57.150 --> 17:00.211
Okay. Hot chick.
Four o'clock.

17:01.650 --> 17:03.084
That's not
four o'clock.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.190
Do you know
how to tell time?

17:04.220 --> 17:06.518
Stop stalling.
Go get her, tiger.

17:07.119 --> 17:08.383
Hi.

17:10.560 --> 17:11.630
IIHill?

17:11.660 --> 17:12.786
Hi...

17:12.829 --> 17:14.093
I can't believe
we're related.

17:14.130 --> 17:17.623
Watch this.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.422
Excuse me, miss.

17:19.470 --> 17:20.835
I don't mean
to embarrass you,

17:20.869 --> 17:22.634
but you have something
on your face.

17:22.670 --> 17:24.160
What?

17:25.640 --> 17:27.199
Beauty.

17:27.240 --> 17:30.107
That is the cheesiest thing
I have ever heard.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.402
That can't possibly work!

17:31.450 --> 17:32.508
Oh, it does.

17:32.550 --> 17:34.245
They laugh, I laugh.
It breaks the ice.

17:34.280 --> 17:35.020
And you follow up
with something

17:35.050 --> 17:36.449
that shows
who you really are.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.312
No one wants to hear
about my sad life.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.511
Modern women want a man

17:39.550 --> 17:42.110
who can communicate,
be vulnerable.

17:42.160 --> 17:42.956
Now we just
got to figure out

17:42.990 --> 17:44.458
what the winning play
for you is.

17:44.490 --> 17:45.423
You know what's been
working for me lately?

17:46.360 --> 17:48.328
I'm from a broken home.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.624
That could work
for you, too.

17:50.670 --> 17:51.330
They don't need to know that

17:51.370 --> 17:52.769
you're the guy
who broke it.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.234
Hey, there.

17:55.170 --> 17:56.137
Hi.

17:56.170 --> 17:59.140
You remind me
of my father.

17:59.540 --> 18:03.147
But I really love
my father.

18:09.220 --> 18:10.847
Stella, hey.
Hi.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.312
Wow.
You look great.

18:12.350 --> 18:14.409
Oh, so do you.
Thank you.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.155
Ooh.
Oh, hey.

18:16.190 --> 18:17.089
First day on the new feet,
huh?

18:17.130 --> 18:18.757
Yeah, I haven't spent
much time in heels

18:18.790 --> 18:20.155
in the last eight years,
SO...

18:21.900 --> 18:23.220
Oh, my God.

18:26.330 --> 18:27.593
Hands off, lady.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.165
He's my daddy tonight.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.163
This is his fault.

18:31.210 --> 18:34.202
This was
your father-son idea,

18:34.240 --> 18:35.503
bringing Dad here
to meet women?

18:35.540 --> 18:37.577
Don't judge me
when you're at a bar

18:37.610 --> 18:39.248
with some dude
who isn't your husband.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.214
Oh, no, no.
We just -- we work together.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.240
Yeah.
Dr. William Grant.

18:42.280 --> 18:45.181
Hi.
And this is my phone.

18:45.220 --> 18:46.085
Excuse me.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.350
Okay, well.
I appear to be going away.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.250
Aah!
Ugh.

18:52.290 --> 18:54.292
I should probably go
monitor that situation.

18:55.700 --> 18:58.192
That's a drastic drop
in the white-blood cell count.

18:58.230 --> 18:59.891
Go ahead
and put her on oxygen.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.830
There's not much we can do
for her at this point.

19:01.870 --> 19:03.201
Thank you.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.662
What

19:04.710 --> 19:06.405
Wh
Oh, no, no. Sadie's fine.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.329
This is a totally
different patient.

19:08.380 --> 19:09.370
Oh, thank God.

19:09.410 --> 19:11.276
I -- I mean, no,
not "thank God"

19:11.310 --> 19:13.210
that your other patient's
getting worse.

19:13.250 --> 19:14.615
I just mean,
"Thank God Sadie's okay" --

19:14.650 --> 19:15.515
well, at least for now,

19:15.550 --> 19:17.917
and, hopefully,
for a really long time

19:17.950 --> 19:19.816
once we nail down
our mission.

19:19.850 --> 19:21.318
You talk a lot.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.816
I know, but don't worry

19:22.860 --> 19:25.522
because my ability to talk
will be a great asset

19:25.560 --> 19:27.289
when we casually
run into Roger Shaw

19:27.330 --> 19:28.525
and I casually mention

19:28.560 --> 19:30.221
that his clinical trial
saved my life

19:30.270 --> 19:31.590
and he reinstates
the trial.

19:32.430 --> 19:34.637
I could use some
liquid courage, though.

19:34.670 --> 19:36.263
Two habanero martinis,
please.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.062
Thank you.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.306
How do you have any idea
what I like?

19:38.340 --> 19:39.808
It's just a guess.

19:42.410 --> 19:46.608
Thank you.

19:46.650 --> 19:48.812
Oh, God.

19:48.850 --> 19:50.318
I love it.
Told you.

19:50.350 --> 19:52.444
But I can order myself.

19:52.490 --> 19:55.312
One habanero martini,
please.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.328
Are you always like this? Yes.

19:57.360 --> 19:58.589
Are you always like that?
Like what?

19:58.630 --> 20:01.258
Like you know all the answers
to everything?

20:01.300 --> 20:02.199
Oh, that.

20:02.230 --> 20:03.527
Yeah, no, I've been
like that since birth.

20:03.570 --> 20:04.765
So is that why
you became a doctor,

20:04.800 --> 20:06.393
so you can tell
people what to do?

20:06.430 --> 20:08.262
Okay,
I'm offended by that

20:08.300 --> 20:09.938
because I became a doctor
for one reason

20:09.970 --> 20:10.960
and one reason only --

20:11.010 --> 20:12.899
my high-school emo band
didn't get a record deal.

20:13.940 --> 20:15.339
Excuse me.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.973
It's the hospital.
sorry.

20:17.010 --> 20:18.444
Dr. Grant.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.516
What happened
to your handsy friend?

20:23.550 --> 20:25.382
She left me for someone
who, apparently,

20:25.420 --> 20:27.286
looks even more
like her father.

20:31.930 --> 20:33.625
Hi. What's up?

20:33.660 --> 20:34.889
Uh, hi.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.566
I'm Peter,

20:38.600 --> 20:39.567
Peter Abbott.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.396
Peter Rabbit?

20:40.440 --> 20:41.965
Just call me Peter.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.331
Okay.

20:43.370 --> 20:45.862
So, uh,
just to be vulnerable,

20:45.910 --> 20:49.369
I'm kind of having
a rough time right now.

20:49.410 --> 20:51.606
My wife left me.

20:51.650 --> 20:54.813
I'm living in a guesthouse
with my adult son.

20:55.780 --> 20:57.339
That is so, uh --

20:57.390 --> 20:59.040
I feel sorry for you.

20:59.090 --> 21:00.649
Well, you should.

21:00.690 --> 21:04.422
It's truly horrible.

21:04.460 --> 21:06.849
You have something
on your face.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.654
Oh, my God.

21:08.700 --> 21:09.690
Stacy?

21:09.730 --> 21:11.425
Why didn't you tell me
I had something on my face?

21:11.470 --> 21:13.598
Okay, I can't do this.

21:13.640 --> 21:17.463
<i>* Xk</i>

21:17.510 --> 21:20.002
That was --
you're great at this.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.474
Pretty run-of-the-mill
stuff.

21:21.510 --> 21:23.444
My mom would have
told me to buck up

21:23.480 --> 21:24.550
and stop embarrassing her

21:24.580 --> 21:27.413
in the bathroom,
in our house,

21:27.450 --> 21:28.713
with no one else around.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.684
You don't talk about
your mom much.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.690
Yeah, well.
Don't talk to my mom much.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.586
Not everyone's
as lucky as your kids.

21:35.620 --> 21:38.749
Well, I am lucky to have
a son-in-law like you.

21:41.360 --> 21:42.327
Oh, it's Diego.

21:42.360 --> 21:43.589
Finally responded to my text.

21:43.630 --> 21:45.496
Well, I'll check on Fiona
before I go.

21:45.530 --> 21:47.020
Okay.

21:47.070 --> 21:48.060
What's up, buddy?

21:48.100 --> 21:49.499
Look,
I'm sorry to bother you.

21:49.540 --> 21:51.429
Fiona threw up
and I kind of panicked.

21:51.470 --> 21:53.063
Yeah, there's a little flu bug
going around their school.

21:53.110 --> 21:54.839
Is she okay? Yeah, yeah.
Everything's under control.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.507
I called Ida 'round
for backup.

21:56.540 --> 21:58.474
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Wes, no.

21:58.510 --> 22:00.478
Ida doesn't do well
with sick.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.578
What are
you talking about?

22:01.620 --> 22:04.419
Let's just say that she has
a tendency to overreact.

22:04.450 --> 22:05.849
She seems fine.

22:05.890 --> 22:09.087
Fiona's good
and Ida's about to head home.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.451
Okay.

22:10.490 --> 22:12.652
All good here.
Don't worry about a thing.

22:12.690 --> 22:13.589
Okay.

22:13.630 --> 22:15.450
Wes, we have a problem!

22:15.500 --> 22:18.094
Fiona has a fever.
It's nearly 101.

22:18.130 --> 22:20.326
We need to take her
to urgent care, right now!

22:21.540 --> 22:24.805
Dr. Grant: Try doubling the
Narcan, but don't intubate.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.365
She's CTD.

22:26.410 --> 22:27.832
Thank you.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.405
What's CTD?

22:29.440 --> 22:32.046
Um, it's, uh --
it's just doctor speak.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.411
For...

22:34.480 --> 22:36.073
For circling the drain.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.145
Wow, that is...

22:38.190 --> 22:39.510
really heartless.

22:39.550 --> 22:41.416
No, this is how
all doctors talk.

22:41.460 --> 22:42.416
It's just
our way of detaching.

22:42.460 --> 22:43.655
It's not personal.

22:43.690 --> 22:44.885
That's just
another way of saying

22:44.930 --> 22:45.829
that you don't care.

22:45.860 --> 22:47.498
You don't think I care?

22:47.530 --> 22:51.023
Stella, you have no idea
the things that I've seen.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.492
Okay, you-- you've been
working at the hospital

22:52.530 --> 22:53.497
for, what, a week now?

22:56.870 --> 22:57.530
Oh.

22:57.570 --> 22:59.004
Wait,
where are you going?

22:59.040 --> 23:00.633
To the hospital.
My CTD is crashing.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.978
I'm sorry, my patient.

23:03.010 --> 23:09.916
<i>* Xk</i>

23:14.060 --> 23:16.415
I may have been abandoned
by Dr. Grant,

23:16.460 --> 23:17.427
but I wasn't giving up.

23:17.460 --> 23:19.485
I still had an ace
up my sleeve.

23:19.530 --> 23:20.622
Stella: Hi, where's Dad?

23:20.660 --> 23:22.424
Just look
for the sweater vest.

23:22.460 --> 23:23.689
He'll be the guy inside it.
Why?

23:23.730 --> 23:25.027
Well, he gave this speech

23:25.070 --> 23:27.459
that got me
into my clinical trial,

23:27.500 --> 23:28.490
and now I need
his help with Sadie.

23:28.540 --> 23:29.894
I'm gonna
have to say "No".

23:29.940 --> 23:31.010
No to what?

23:31.040 --> 23:33.771
You told me earlier today
to take care of Dad, right?

23:33.810 --> 23:36.177
Dad's done
fighting cancer.

23:36.210 --> 23:38.474
I'm trying to get him to
take a step forward tonight,

23:38.510 --> 23:39.909
not two steps back.

23:41.250 --> 23:42.843
Okay. You're right.

23:43.790 --> 23:44.985
Well, I'll just figure out

23:45.020 --> 23:46.545
how to talk to Roger Shaw
myself.

23:46.590 --> 23:47.853
You got this, sis.

23:47.890 --> 23:49.016
If there's one thing
you don't need help with,

23:49.060 --> 23:50.050
it's talking.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.621
Okay. Back at it.

23:58.670 --> 24:00.695
This is a great
conversation starter.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.959
Don't know what's in it,
just pretend to like it.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.469
Aiden,
I really appreciate this.

24:05.510 --> 24:06.568
It's no problem.

24:06.610 --> 24:07.361
I just told the bartender

24:07.410 --> 24:08.639
to dump in all the stuff
with colors.

24:08.680 --> 24:09.738
I mean, tonight.

24:09.780 --> 24:11.908
Uh,
tonight's not over yet.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.179
It is for me.

24:13.210 --> 24:14.678
N

24:14.720 --> 24:18.748
Thank you for trying,
but I can't do it.

24:19.890 --> 24:23.485

be able to do it again.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.521
Maybe your mother
was it for me.

24:25.560 --> 24:26.959
Dad, you're old.

24:26.990 --> 24:28.594
You're not dead.

24:28.630 --> 24:29.995
You can still have
a great time tonight.

24:30.030 --> 24:31.998
I did have a great time

24:32.030 --> 24:34.135
because I got
to spend time with my son.

24:34.170 --> 24:39.529
You know the last time
you asked me to hang out?

24:39.570 --> 24:41.629
We saw the Mariners lose
to the Yankees.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.977
I must have been 15.

24:43.010 --> 24:45.672
I can't believe
you remember that.

24:45.710 --> 24:47.747
You were 12, actually.

24:47.780 --> 24:50.511
That was one of
the best days of my life.

24:50.550 --> 24:53.611
<i>* Xk</i>

24:53.660 --> 24:55.879
So, the next time
you want to do something,

24:55.920 --> 24:59.652
I don't need all this,
whatever this is.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.527
I just...

25:04.570 --> 25:05.594
need you.

25:07.030 --> 25:08.737
And maybe a beer.

25:08.770 --> 25:11.740
All right,
let's get out of here

25:11.770 --> 25:13.829
before you make me cry
in this bar.

25:13.880 --> 25:14.676
You stay.

25:14.710 --> 25:16.235
I'm fine on my own.
Not a chance.

25:16.280 --> 25:17.805
This is our night out.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.674
Or this is
a decent stopping point

25:22.720 --> 25:24.119
if we just
want to call it.

25:24.150 --> 25:26.619
Bye, son.
Bye.

25:29.660 --> 25:30.889
We're making a mistake!

25:30.930 --> 25:32.921
We need to take her
to urgent care.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.724
I spoke
to Lizzie and Diego.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.797
They said a 100.8 fever
is no cause for concern.

25:36.830 --> 25:38.195
Then let's check again!

25:38.230 --> 25:40.631
No, we've already
checked it three times.

25:40.670 --> 25:41.796
I need to call Lizzie.

25:41.840 --> 25:42.932
No, we just got off the phone
with Lizzie.

25:42.970 --> 25:44.608
Please,
just relax for a minute.

25:44.640 --> 25:45.710
I can't relax.

25:45.740 --> 25:46.536
Something could turn
on a dime.

25:46.570 --> 25:48.231
I'm checking her
temperature again.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.702
I -- no, Ida. Listen.

25:49.740 --> 25:50.673
I'm gonna have to ask you

25:50.710 --> 25:52.269
to put the thermometer down
and step back.

25:52.310 --> 25:54.620
Lizzie and Diego said
they want her to rest.

25:54.650 --> 25:56.015
That's what she needs
right now.

25:56.050 --> 25:56.869
They're not here.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.217
They -- they don't see
what I'm seeing.

25:58.250 --> 25:59.718
She's sleeping peacefully.

25:59.750 --> 26:00.751
I think you're being
irrational about this.

26:00.790 --> 26:03.725
It's not irrational
to make sure Stella's okay.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.683

26:05.730 --> 26:07.129

26:14.970 --> 26:18.008
Oh, thank you,
but I probably shouldn't.

26:18.740 --> 26:21.038
Actually, yes, I could use
a little more courage.

26:22.380 --> 26:24.109
Courage for what?

26:24.150 --> 26:25.743
Oh, I'm waiting for the owner
of the hotel.

26:25.780 --> 26:27.270
I scoped it out
with the waiter,

26:27.310 --> 26:29.312
and he's gonna be
sitting at that table

26:29.350 --> 26:31.614
and I'm gonna give
this big, uplifting speech

26:31.650 --> 26:33.209
so he gives me
a bunch of money.

26:33.250 --> 26:34.854
That's gonna be some speech.

26:34.890 --> 26:36.710
Right?
I can't wait to hear it.

26:36.760 --> 26:37.625
So, what do you
need money for?

26:37.660 --> 26:40.789
I am a volunteer
at Lone Pine Hospital.

26:40.830 --> 26:41.854
He's a big donor,

26:41.900 --> 26:43.322
but he pulled the funding
for this clinical trial.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.725
Why did he pull
the funding?

26:45.670 --> 26:48.093
My theory is
he's a huge d-bag

26:48.140 --> 26:50.700
who just wanted to invest
his money in fancy hotels,

26:50.740 --> 26:51.662
instead of people.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.838
Maybe.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.871
Or maybe all clinical trials

26:55.910 --> 26:58.345
have to present
a standard rate of repetition

26:58.380 --> 27:00.303
that this one
couldn't attain.

27:00.350 --> 27:01.909
You know, for a bartender,

27:01.950 --> 27:05.284
you sure do know a lot
about clinical trials.

27:09.790 --> 27:11.349
Oh, my God.
Please don't tell --

27:11.390 --> 27:12.824
Roger Shaw.

27:12.860 --> 27:13.952
Huge d-bag.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.035
Spinning wheel of death.

27:28.080 --> 27:31.004
Probably my crappy karma
jamming the hotel Wi-Fi.

27:32.210 --> 27:35.817
You could take it up
with the hotel concierge,

27:35.850 --> 27:37.818
but she's waiting
for an Uber

27:37.850 --> 27:40.683
because her ex-husband
just had her car repossessed.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.279
Eesh.
Yeah.

27:42.320 --> 27:43.685
This whole divorce thing

27:43.730 --> 27:45.789
is turning out to be
a real drag.

27:45.830 --> 27:48.754
Going through one
myself.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.689

27:51.970 --> 27:53.790

Uh-huh.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.831
Did your ex
serve you divorce papers

27:55.870 --> 27:56.894
on your birthday?

27:56.940 --> 27:58.101
Oh, ho.

27:58.140 --> 28:00.404
Did your ex
take a sledgehammer

28:00.440 --> 28:01.737
to a wall in your house?

28:01.780 --> 28:03.771
Did your ex
take everything?

28:03.810 --> 28:05.448
I mean, everything.

28:05.480 --> 28:06.709
Mine took tampons.

28:08.780 --> 28:10.885
Mine left those for me
because there were plenty

28:10.920 --> 28:12.888
at her
new girlfriend's house.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.059
Damn. You win.

28:16.890 --> 28:18.221
I'm Lauren.

28:18.260 --> 28:20.149
Oh, I'm Peter.

28:20.190 --> 28:21.749
Nice to meet you.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.792
Yeah, it really is.

28:24.830 --> 28:26.229
Huh.

28:28.940 --> 28:30.806
I keep my special stash
back here.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.899
I'm particular
with my cocktails.

28:32.940 --> 28:33.930
Have a wonderful evening.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.301
Oh, my God, Stella.
Start talking.

28:36.340 --> 28:37.899
Wait!
I need your money!

28:37.950 --> 28:39.008
Stop talking.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.779
Was that
your uplifting speech

28:40.820 --> 28:42.219
"cause, I got to say, I
expected it would be a bit longer.

28:42.250 --> 28:44.844
What I'm trying to say
is that --

28:44.890 --> 28:46.483
It's okay.
You said it earlier.

28:46.520 --> 28:47.954
You need my money.

28:47.990 --> 28:49.219
I said,
"I pulled the funding

28:49.260 --> 28:51.820
because the trial
wasn't effective".

28:51.860 --> 28:52.930
Yes, it was.

28:52.960 --> 28:54.826
<i>* Xk</i>

28:54.860 --> 28:57.864
That trial saved my life

28:57.900 --> 29:00.096
and now it could save
my friend's.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.137
Her name is Sadie,

29:03.170 --> 29:04.899
and I
should probably tell you

29:04.940 --> 29:07.466
that she's sweet and kind
and optimistic,

29:07.510 --> 29:08.932
but, truthfully,

29:08.980 --> 29:10.379
she's a sarcastic,
little cynic --

29:10.410 --> 29:11.844
totally the anti-me --

29:11.880 --> 29:13.370
but that is
what I love about her.

29:13.410 --> 29:16.948
And she's also a little wise
beyond her years,

29:16.980 --> 29:19.017
which is so amazing,

29:19.050 --> 29:20.859
but it also breaks my heart,

29:20.890 --> 29:25.953
because I don't know
if she'll make to those years.

29:25.990 --> 29:28.891
But if you put
the money back in,

29:28.930 --> 29:30.329
maybe she will.

29:31.100 --> 29:33.831
Now that was
a good speech.

29:35.000 --> 29:35.660
I'll tell you what.

29:35.700 --> 29:37.429
I'll put
the money back in.

29:39.410 --> 29:40.468
As soon as they figure out

29:40.510 --> 29:41.978
how to repeat
the results you got.

29:43.110 --> 29:45.044
The FDA
rejected the protocol.

29:45.080 --> 29:47.447
Only one person survived.

29:48.480 --> 29:49.845
What?

29:49.880 --> 29:51.882
I was the only one?

29:52.990 --> 29:55.379
Oh.

29:55.420 --> 29:58.390
Well, how long will it take
to start the trial back up?

29:58.430 --> 30:00.057
A year, maybe two.

30:00.090 --> 30:01.990
What if Sadie doesn't
last that long?

30:02.030 --> 30:04.124
Well, that's the best
I can do.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.365
<i>* Xk</i>

30:05.400 --> 30:07.960
I wanted to scream
that the best wasn't enough,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.901
I wanted to tell him
too many kids were dying.

30:10.940 --> 30:12.829
Instead I said...

30:12.870 --> 30:14.133
Thank you.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.308

30:21.080 --> 30:24.243
So, a week after camping,
my son comes home,

30:24.290 --> 30:27.988
and he refuses to pee
anywhere but outside.

30:28.020 --> 30:30.990
Oh, my son still nature-pees
whenever he can,

30:31.030 --> 30:31.849

Ugh, I can't believe
how late it is.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.060
Ah, I'm sorry.
I'm rambling.

30:39.100 --> 30:40.590
I should let you
get home.

30:40.630 --> 30:43.099
Why?

30:46.040 --> 30:48.429
Any interest
in grabbing a drink

30:48.480 --> 30:50.175
somewhere...not here.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.970

What about you?

31:12.370 --> 31:14.236
I don't know.

Is that what you think?

31:27.110 --> 31:30.114
Stella, it was never easy.

31:30.150 --> 31:32.585
And that's when Aiden told me
the truth

about what my parents
went through for me.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.020

uplifting speech

that got me
into that trial.

31:41.330 --> 31:43.924
Week after week,
my parents would come in,

31:43.970 --> 31:46.598
sludge their way through
healthcare bureaucracy,

31:46.630 --> 31:48.064
and plead my case.

32:18.700 --> 32:21.431
It was a long road,

32:21.470 --> 32:24.110
and it took
a lot out of them.

32:25.710 --> 32:29.135
They were in there
all the time,

32:29.180 --> 32:31.000
making sure the air vents
in your room

32:31.050 --> 32:31.801
were pointed the right way,

32:31.850 --> 32:34.012
getting you
the latest equipment.

32:34.050 --> 32:37.315
They fought hard.

32:37.350 --> 32:39.648
They went through hell,
huh?

32:39.690 --> 32:43.354
They did.

32:43.390 --> 32:48.089
But you're worth it.

32:48.130 --> 32:53.125
Yes, Sadie is, too.

But...
what if I can't do it?

32:55.570 --> 32:57.095
What if I can't give her

32:57.140 --> 32:59.563
the same happy ending
that Mom and Dad gave me?

32:59.610 --> 33:01.430
You can't think like that.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.006
You can't stop trying.

33:04.050 --> 33:06.007
You just have to know,
going into it,

33:06.050 --> 33:10.009
- that sometimes
it's gonna hurt a lot.

33:10.050 --> 33:14.180

34:14.580 --> 34:16.810
When Stella was 15,

34:16.850 --> 34:18.340
she told me
she was feeling sick,

34:18.389 --> 34:21.212
but she couldn't describe
exactly what was wrong,

34:21.260 --> 34:24.422
so I chalked it up
to back-to-school stress.

34:24.460 --> 34:27.179
<i>* Xk</i>

34:27.230 --> 34:30.530
It took me a month
to take her to the doctor.

34:30.560 --> 34:31.766
<i>* Xk</i>

34:31.800 --> 34:35.565
For the longest time,
I blamed myself,

34:35.600 --> 34:38.638
"If only I had
taken her sooner".

34:39.670 --> 34:41.570
But she's okay now.

34:41.610 --> 34:44.601
But sometimes,
I'm just not sure I am.

34:44.909 --> 34:46.378
Hey,
we're all here for you.

34:46.409 --> 34:49.072
It's what family's for.

34:50.219 --> 34:51.415
Thank you.

34:53.320 --> 34:54.754
Oh.

34:54.790 --> 34:56.417
Speaking of family.
Hm.

34:56.460 --> 34:58.679
Hey, Diego.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.550
Hey, just wanted
to make sure

35:00.590 --> 35:02.149
that everything
was okay over there.

35:02.200 --> 35:02.894
Everything's great.

35:02.930 --> 35:04.694
Kids are sleeping.

35:04.730 --> 35:08.166
I am just sitting here
with...Mum.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.532
Did you just
call me Mum?

35:10.570 --> 35:11.708
He totally did.

35:12.940 --> 35:14.704
Yeah.

35:14.740 --> 35:16.230
I love my boys.

35:16.280 --> 35:19.170
Oh, I'm so glad
that tonight was a success

35:19.210 --> 35:21.645
because I was actually
wondering if you're free,

35:21.680 --> 35:22.841
maybe you could --

35:22.880 --> 35:24.188
You're breaking up,
mate.

35:24.220 --> 35:26.439
Oh, I --
I was just gonna ask --

35:26.490 --> 35:28.356
Hard to hear.
What?

35:28.390 --> 35:29.585
I can see you.

<i>* Xk</i>

35:33.460 --> 35:35.258
<i>* Xk</i>

35:35.300 --> 35:38.463
Now that I knew what
it was like to lose a battle,

35:38.500 --> 35:41.868
I understood why Dr. Grant
needed to detach.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.267
Hey.

35:47.310 --> 35:48.573
Dr. Grant: Hey.

35:48.610 --> 35:50.408
Are you okay?

35:50.440 --> 35:52.204
Yeah, I'm fine.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.218
I came to apologize

35:54.250 --> 35:56.469
about the whole
"heartless" thing.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.784
Clearly, you're not.

35:58.820 --> 36:01.460
Did your patient...

36:01.490 --> 36:07.623
<i>* Xk</i>

36:07.660 --> 36:09.150
I was wrong.

36:10.930 --> 36:13.228
This isn't just
a job to you.

36:13.270 --> 36:18.959
<i>* Xk</i>

36:19.010 --> 36:21.274
My big brother's name
was Jesse.

36:21.310 --> 36:24.940
And, uh, he liked BMX

36:24.980 --> 36:28.769
and the Seahawks

36:28.820 --> 36:31.414
and any song by The Shins.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.311
He was my hero.

36:38.990 --> 36:40.685
And in every single patient
I treat,

36:40.730 --> 36:43.927
every single one,
I see him.

36:45.730 --> 36:49.360
And when I lose one,

36:49.400 --> 36:51.767
I lose my brother
all over again.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.562
<i>* Xk</i>

36:53.610 --> 36:55.339
I'm so sorry.

36:55.380 --> 36:58.304

36:58.350 --> 37:02.275
Stella, I know
what you're going through

37:02.320 --> 37:03.640
because I know
what it's like

37:03.680 --> 37:07.685
to wake up every single day
and wonder...

37:07.720 --> 37:09.381
"Why am I
the one that lived?"

37:09.420 --> 37:11.559
<i>* Xk</i>

37:11.590 --> 37:13.627
How do you do it?

37:13.660 --> 37:16.960
How do you keep going?

37:17.000 --> 37:20.265
You take the wins
when you can get them...

37:21.400 --> 37:23.038
...and you try not
to let the losses

37:23.070 --> 37:25.368
throw you too far
off track.

37:27.010 --> 37:29.570
There's a reason that
you want to help people.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.030
I'm glad.

38:22.060 --> 38:23.892
I missed you.

38:23.930 --> 38:26.900
I missed you, too.

38:27.830 --> 38:29.036
How are the kids?

38:29.070 --> 38:30.765
The kids are great.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.336
And...?

38:32.370 --> 38:34.372
Mum? She's good.

38:34.410 --> 38:35.775
She left about
20 minutes ago.

38:35.810 --> 38:37.539
Did you just call her
Ilmumll?

38:37.580 --> 38:39.378
My mom?
I did.

38:40.750 --> 38:41.774
How did your mission go?

38:41.820 --> 38:45.085
Uh, I failed.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.782
But I'm gonna keep trying.

38:47.820 --> 38:50.357
Do you know you don't
have to do this?

38:50.390 --> 38:52.779
Most people wouldn't want
to set foot in a hospital

38:52.830 --> 38:54.082
after what
you went through.

38:54.130 --> 38:55.928
Well,
I'm not most people.

Aiden?

39:19.590 --> 39:21.012
What are you doing here?!

39:21.050 --> 39:24.987
I live here

whose room
you just came out of,

39:27.760 --> 39:28.989

Yeah...

So, I guess what
I'm saying is...

I'm sorry
that I didn't tell you

39:38.840 --> 39:40.433
the trial had been pulled.

39:40.470 --> 39:41.972
But it should be
up and running

39:42.010 --> 39:44.035
in a year or two.

to stick around until then.

Oh, I insist.

sit around waiting.

gonna submit you for,

you see that, too.

the brochures.

her on the team. I know.
