of veterans day,

00:04.839 --> 00:07.705
We've got a very special
guest speaker.

00:07.708 --> 00:10.309
A real, live war hero:

00:10.311 --> 00:12.277
Woody johnson.

00:12.279 --> 00:15.447
- Hi, kids, she's right.
I am a war hero.

00:15.449 --> 00:16.949
- My dad's a fireman.

00:16.951 --> 00:19.351
- Your dad is a pussy.
- Aw.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.387
- While your fathers
were all smoking doobies

00:21.389 --> 00:23.222
And washing out
their vaginas,

00:23.224 --> 00:25.357
I was in the shit
fighting for your freedom...

00:25.359 --> 00:28.827
When I wasn't giving iraqi
whores my veiny hussein-y.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.396
[laughs]

00:30.398 --> 00:32.197
- Can you skip to the part
where you got your medal?

00:32.198 --> 00:33.866
- I'm getting to that,
bitch.

00:33.868 --> 00:37.336
I was in an elite special ops
unit called the red skulls.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.071
One day when we were
on patrol,

00:39.073 --> 00:41.306
A fellow soldier,
private jackubowski,

00:41.308 --> 00:42.541
Got wounded.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.209
I saved his life.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.812
I dragged that half-dead bastard
over three miles

00:46.814 --> 00:48.647
Of war-torn desert.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.883
It was a truly brave act.

00:50.885 --> 00:53.018
- How did the soldier
get hurt?

00:53.020 --> 00:54.153
- What are you,
the [bleep] hague?

00:54.155 --> 00:55.354
It was a long time ago.

00:55.356 --> 00:56.922
Like I can remember
all the details.

00:56.924 --> 00:58.223

Now we are blood brothers
for life.

We'll always have
each others' backs.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.864

You and malloy already live

have to spring for indoor snow?

- Gonna what?
You can't fire me.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.583
I'm in the goddamn
ranger union.

08:04.585 --> 08:07.085
- There's no such thing
as a ranger union.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.453
- Huh?
- Ooh, sorry.

08:08.455 --> 08:10.322
I forgot I made that up.
- What?

08:10.324 --> 08:12.290
- You deserve to be terminated,
johnson.

08:12.292 --> 08:15.827
But I've got a better idea:
A demotion.

08:16.929 --> 08:18.763
Sorry, a lowly ranger

08:18.765 --> 08:21.766
Can't stay in this cabin,
but I can.

08:21.768 --> 08:23.802
You two will have to find
housing elsewhere.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.538
- Elsewhere?
Elsewhere where?

08:26.540 --> 08:27.939
- Not a chance.
- Not with me.

08:27.941 --> 08:28.940
- No way in hell.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.876
- Then where are we supposed
to stay?

08:32.111 --> 08:33.645
- Now if you gotta shit,

08:33.647 --> 08:35.179
Go on the newspaper.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.515
The sink's stopped up.
- Perfect.

08:41.721 --> 08:42.953
- Great job, woody.
This place is almost as bad

08:42.956 --> 08:44.188
As a comfort inn.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.525
- Goddamn you, jim. I told you
to pay the light bill.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.527
- I hope they do shut it off
so I won't be able to see

08:48.529 --> 08:50.228
Your damn ugly face!

[objects crash]

08:53.000 --> 08:54.733
- Oh! Oh, god. Ow!

08:54.735 --> 08:57.569
- You're the one who told me
to stand up to the secretary.

08:57.571 --> 09:00.338
- I'm a bear.
You took advice from a bear.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.574
- Good point.
I won't do that again.

09:02.576 --> 09:03.808
- Now I've got some advice
for you.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.577
- Lay it on me.
- From now on,

09:05.579 --> 09:07.412
You are going to do
everything she says,

09:07.414 --> 09:09.681
And beg her
for your old job back.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.383
- I hate you,
you son of a bitch.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.051
- Aah!

09:13.053 --> 09:15.487
- I can't spend another night
in this stump dump.

09:15.489 --> 09:16.688
We've gotta
get our place back.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.557
- We will, malloy.
I promise.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.058
Let's just try
to make the best of it.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.561
- Oh! Oh! Oh, lord.
- Ooh! Oh, yeah, give it to me.

09:22.563 --> 09:25.230
Oh, yeah, give it to me, jim.
- Oh! Oh! Oh, lord.

09:26.432 --> 09:28.733
- Please. Please,
give me my job back.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.535
I saw an amputated stump
go somewhere

09:30.537 --> 09:32.237
It shouldn't of last night.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.072
- Get up, johnson,
you slob.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.708
If you want your old job back,
you have to earn it.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.843
Start by doing everything
on this list.

09:38.845 --> 09:41.646

You've gotta try

10:32.499 --> 10:33.832
They're yumsters.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.134

10:36.136 --> 10:37.569
Mmm, these are great.

10:37.571 --> 10:39.004
Did you bake them?

10:39.006 --> 10:41.439

denzel's yard sale.

Wait. What?

- Okay, miss secretary, ma'am.
I did everything on your list.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.756
- I know, johnson.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.591
Woody, it gives me
great pleasure

10:59.593 --> 11:02.260
To tell you
the new head ranger

11:02.262 --> 11:04.496
Is denzel jackson.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.964
- What?
- No!

11:05.966 --> 11:08.099
- That's awesome.
Thank you, secretary.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.669
- What the hell?
I did everything you asked!

11:10.671 --> 11:12.604
Why are you
ruining my life?

11:12.606 --> 11:15.173
- Because a loser like you
doesn't deserve a life.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.942
You actually thought I was
going to give you your job back?

11:17.944 --> 11:21.613
Ha! You'll never be
head ranger again on my watch.

11:21.615 --> 11:23.281
- Why, you dirty
piece of sh--

11:23.283 --> 11:26.484
- Don't lose your temper, woody.
We can handle this like adults.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.619
We are going to kill her.

11:27.621 --> 11:29.454
- Now that's good advice.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.356
Hey, can you kill
the secretary for us?

11:31.358 --> 11:33.158
- Already done.
[snaps fingers]

11:33.160 --> 11:36.394
- That's a secretary,
not the secretary.

11:36.396 --> 11:39.531
Oh, don't worry. I've got like
15 more in the truck.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.566
There's going to be a lot
of unbrewed coffee

11:41.568 --> 11:43.768
And empty spread sheets
next week.

11:44.637 --> 11:46.404
- Okay. We can ride this out.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.906
We just need to stay calm.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.542
- You're right.
We'll be fine by tomorrow.

11:50.544 --> 11:51.743
Tomorrow?

11:51.745 --> 11:53.578
Connie. The drug test
is tomorrow.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.080
- Aah!

11:55.082 --> 11:56.648
- We have to find
some clean urine.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.249
- I've got a fake penis.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.684
- What good will that do us?

11:59.686 --> 12:01.953
- I'm just saying.

12:02.755 --> 12:04.756
- Head ranger denzel jackson.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.324
I like the sound of that.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.926
- Looking good, buddy.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.662
I think that this is cause
for a little celebration, huh?

12:10.664 --> 12:12.263
- Steve, what the hell, man?

12:12.265 --> 12:14.566
- Head rangers give drug tests,
not take them.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.267
So you can get high again.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.702
- I don't want to get high,

12:17.704 --> 12:18.737
And it's messed up
that you of all people

12:18.739 --> 12:20.205
Would try to get me to.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.906
- It's just you've been
a little uptight.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.109
You haven't seemed
like yourself since you quit.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.577
- This is myself.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.546
The pothead who laughed at all
your dumb bullshit was not me.

12:28.548 --> 12:31.316
I'm never smoking again.

the clean pee...

12:49.703 --> 12:51.302
- No!
Oh, we're finished!

12:51.304 --> 12:53.438
- We can just come up
with another plan.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.739
- We're high!

12:54.741 --> 12:56.741
It took 17 hours to
come up with this plan.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.877
- I've got it.
We need to go see jorge.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.513
He can fix anything.
But we gotta hurry.

13:02.414 --> 13:05.350
- Slow down, connie!

13:06.418 --> 13:09.320
No! You're gonna kill us!

13:10.589 --> 13:12.223
- Well, like my daddy
always said,

13:12.225 --> 13:14.726
You want to kill somebody right,
you gotta kill them yourself.

13:15.761 --> 13:18.263
- Who the hell put rice
in my coffee?

13:18.265 --> 13:19.664
- Yes!

13:19.666 --> 13:23.134
- Ricin, you idiot.
Not "rice in."

13:23.136 --> 13:25.303
- Hurry up, malloy.
Cut the brakes.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.437
- Got it.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.506
- Ha-ha! Aah!

13:31.443 --> 13:33.778
All right, lady, we'll make this
quick and painless.

13:33.780 --> 13:36.581
- Don't.
I like pain.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.917
- Ow! Ow!
- You mother--

13:42.688 --> 13:44.656
- Hey, you two,
shit's about to get weird.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.257
Get the cool whip.

13:46.259 --> 13:49.661
- Well, we're in for
another rough night, malloy.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.696
She won.
She beat us.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.766
We'll just start a new life
somewhere else.

13:54.768 --> 13:55.767
- We're not going out
like this, woody.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.101
You are a war hero.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.537
Before we leave,
we should shit in her mailbox.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.506
- Malloy, you are on
an advice roll.

14:02.474 --> 14:03.942
- What do you want?

14:03.944 --> 14:06.211
- Look, it was wrong
to try and get you to smoke.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.847
I'm sorry.
I brought you a peace offering.

14:08.849 --> 14:11.616
Your favorite thing
in the world.

14:11.618 --> 14:12.684
- A macrib?

14:12.686 --> 14:14.118
- They're out of season,

14:14.120 --> 14:15.854
So don't ask me what I had to do
to get it.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.188
Here's a hint:

14:17.190 --> 14:20.024
It involved grimace
and a hand job.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.560
- Steve, I only liked those
because I was high.

14:22.562 --> 14:23.895
- You don't want it?

14:23.897 --> 14:25.396
- Damn it, steve.
Look what you did.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.731
Get the hell out of here
and leave me alone.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.066
- All I want--I just--

14:28.068 --> 14:29.634
- Well, I guess it's not
just the macrib

14:29.636 --> 14:30.735
I only like when I'm high.

14:30.737 --> 14:31.870

- No.

- Seth rogen?
- No!

14:33.240 --> 14:36.708
You, steve.
I don't like you anymore.

14:36.710 --> 14:40.678
- Denzel, you may have gotten
your short-term memory back,

14:40.680 --> 14:42.380
But you forgot
who you were.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.915

I can't hold you much longer.

14:49.155 --> 14:52.590

to take a horizontal shit.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.330
What the hell
is she doing?

14:59.332 --> 15:00.865
- Oh, my god.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.734
She is obsessed with you.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.903
- It all makes sense now.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.871
That's why she's been
treating me like shit.

15:06.873 --> 15:09.540
- This is great.
We can have our lives back.

15:09.542 --> 15:10.775
You just need to ram her.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.911
Ram her hard.
Ram her long.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.846
Ram her deep.
- Ew, no way.

15:14.848 --> 15:16.180
She's disgusting.

Now come on home.

to hose down beulah.

after a good screwing.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.122
- Okay, I'll ram her.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.490
Ram her hard, ram her long,
ram her deep.

- Oh, no.

Here comes the secretary.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.131
- She's catching up
with the car.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.466
She's like <i> terminator 2!</i>

15:35.468 --> 15:36.734
Oh, crap, we're dead.

15:36.736 --> 15:39.237
- Just act straight, connie.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.106
- I'm straight. I love penis.
- What?

15:42.108 --> 15:44.742
This is about
your drug tests.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.077
You passed.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.645
- We did?
- How's that possible?

- You took it yesterday,
remember?

15:49.616 --> 15:50.915
- That's right.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.417
We must have been so high
that we forgot.

15:55.255 --> 15:58.489
- What did you say?
- She knows!

16:04.997 --> 16:06.831
- I can't stand
steve's silly ass.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.600
He doesn't know anything
about work ethic.

Hello, denzel.

16:12.906 --> 16:14.505
- Aah! What the hell are you?

16:14.507 --> 16:17.942
- You don't remember me?
I'm your childhood friend.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.344
- Reefer sutherland?

16:19.346 --> 16:21.446
- That's right.
I'm here to stop you

16:21.448 --> 16:24.182
From losing your best friend
steve,

16:24.184 --> 16:26.517
Because you're all uptight
and kind of a dick.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.586
- Well, what can I do
to save our friendship?

16:28.588 --> 16:31.489
- Smoke me, denzel.
Smoke me.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.924
- No, I won't do it.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.459
I'm making something
of my life.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.928
- I'm going to show you
what life will be like

16:36.930 --> 16:38.930
If you never smoke again.

16:38.932 --> 16:40.665
Abraca-dopey.

16:42.034 --> 16:43.868
- Oh, look.
That's my old drug dealer.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.304
- I'm sorry.
I lost my best client, denzel.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.806
There'll be no operation
for whiny tim.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.042
- But, dad!

16:51.044 --> 16:52.844
- Shut your whiny ass up!

16:52.846 --> 16:55.113
- Hocus smoke-us.

16:55.115 --> 16:59.350
Without you as a friend,
steve hit rock bottom.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.120
- Oh, my god.
Steve's a homeless bum?

17:02.122 --> 17:05.189
- No.
He blows homeless bums.

17:05.191 --> 17:08.059
- Now will you be my friend?
- No.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.361
- That's terrible.
But what happens to me, reefer?

17:10.363 --> 17:13.464
- Without weed, you were
a workaholic overachiever.

17:13.465 --> 17:16.834
You become the first
all-black president.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.704
Presto-weedo.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.138
- Hell, yeah!
That's awesome!

17:21.141 --> 17:22.707
Wait a minute.
Why am I blind?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.175
- Glaucoma.

17:24.176 --> 17:27.244
You made marijuana possession
a capital offense.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.347
- Who's that?
- Whiny tim.

17:29.349 --> 17:32.750
- Why'd you have to ruin
my childhood?

17:32.752 --> 17:35.586
Now I have to kill you.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.022
- Run, blind president me!

17:38.024 --> 17:40.591
Aah! Aah! Aah!

17:42.594 --> 17:44.662
[inhales]

17:44.664 --> 17:46.831
Steve, warm up
that macrib

17:46.833 --> 17:48.599
And paint some eyeballs
on your titties.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.069
I'm back, bitch!

17:51.071 --> 17:53.638
- Be right there, buddy.
- No.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.609
- Johnson, what the hell
are you doing?

17:58.611 --> 18:00.211
- I know your secret.

18:00.213 --> 18:03.114
I saw your little
love shrine to me.

18:03.116 --> 18:06.417
I'm here to give you what
you want: Johnson's johnson.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.686
- You're a very clever man,
woody.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.588
That's exactly
what I want.

18:10.590 --> 18:14.592
- Man, it is good to be back
in the upper middle class.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.661
Where's my controller?

18:17.596 --> 18:19.430
Holy shit.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.033
There it is.

18:23.135 --> 18:25.303
- Ooh, kinky.
Daddy like.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.572
- Woody, you think you know
my secret.

18:27.574 --> 18:30.641
But there's one gaping hole
you missed.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.044
- Aah! What the hell is that?

18:33.046 --> 18:35.279
- You don't like it?

18:35.281 --> 18:38.416
- No. It looks like someone
spilled a can of ravioli.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.784
- Okay. I--

18:39.786 --> 18:42.920
- It looks like the elephant man
after a pie-eating contest.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.589
- You done?

18:44.591 --> 18:46.757
- No. It looks like
a bangladeshi street vendor

18:46.759 --> 18:47.925
Flipped over his food cart!

18:47.927 --> 18:49.093
- Enough.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.595
This is your handiwork.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.563
- What the hell
are you talking about?

18:52.565 --> 18:55.433
- You don't remember
your "brother"?

18:55.435 --> 18:56.601
- Oh, my god.

18:56.603 --> 18:57.768
Private jackubowski?

18:57.770 --> 18:59.437
- That's right, woody.

18:59.439 --> 19:02.473
After you threw me on that
grenade and blew my dick off,

19:02.475 --> 19:05.276
It was less humiliating
to live as a woman.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.278
The thought of revenge
was the only thing

19:07.280 --> 19:09.914
That kept me from blowing
my brains out.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.650
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.951
- Are you going to kill me?

19:13.953 --> 19:15.753
- That's much
too quick and easy.

19:15.755 --> 19:16.921
An eye for an eye.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.357
A dong for a dong.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.591
[laughs]

19:20.593 --> 19:22.793
- Not the dong! Not the dong!
Not the dong!

19:22.795 --> 19:24.829
[woody screams]

19:24.831 --> 19:27.565
- Yeah, woody.
You get that job back.

19:30.869 --> 19:32.436
- I've taken your job,

19:32.438 --> 19:34.505
Your house,
your dignity.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.708
Now it's time
for the final piece.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.644
You took my manhood.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.946
Now I'm taking yours.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.114
- No!

19:43.116 --> 19:45.650
[gasps]
- remember the day we got those?

19:45.652 --> 19:49.287
We were brothers, jackubowski,
and I'm sorry I let you down.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.022
I know I deserve this.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.291
Just--just get it over with.

19:55.460 --> 19:59.697
- As much as I hate you,
I'm still a red skull.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.132
I took a vow.

20:01.134 --> 20:03.868
Respect and protect.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.169
- You know something,
jackubowski?

20:05.171 --> 20:06.971
Even without
your hose and clankers,

20:06.973 --> 20:08.739
You're a better man
than I am.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.241
What I did to you
was wrong.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.543
I'd do anything
to make it up to you.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.146
- Well, I haven't had sex
since the incident.

20:15.148 --> 20:17.081
- [laughs]
wait, you're serious?

20:17.083 --> 20:19.183
- [laughs]
- that's not even a real vagina.

20:19.185 --> 20:20.751
- Oh, yeah.
- No! Aah! Aah!

20:20.753 --> 20:22.920
Okay, it ain't bad.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.555
- I'm glad our plan worked.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.891
- I don't want
to talk about it.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.427
What the hell happened
to you two?

20:29.429 --> 20:30.528
- Don't ask.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.096
We've had a rough
couple of days.

20:32.098 --> 20:34.732
- We're never
getting high again.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.867
- Oh, there's my weed water.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.436
[both gulp]

20:38.438 --> 20:40.204
- Well, I've learned
a lesson,

20:40.206 --> 20:42.840
To respect and protect
my staff.

20:42.842 --> 20:46.677
- You left the top off
the cool whip, asshole!

20:46.679 --> 20:48.679
- Aah!
- Whoa!

20:50.082 --> 20:53.251
- [laughs]

20:53.253 --> 20:55.753
Steve, you a funny
mother[bleep].
