00:00.225 --> 00:01.720
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.812 --> 00:04.788
I've decided to pursue the
Maggi's franchise in New York.

00:05.137 --> 00:06.671
- Huh!
- You know, this opportunity,

00:06.705 --> 00:08.340
it's the start of
something of something big.

00:08.374 --> 00:10.442
You bought me a horse?

00:11.270 --> 00:13.245
- Peter. Hi.
- Peter: Hey.

00:13.279 --> 00:14.679
Nice lookin' horse.

00:14.714 --> 00:16.047
Yeah, it's just a horse.
It doesn't matter.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.649
It doesn't mean anything.

00:17.683 --> 00:19.951
Hey, Amy, how are ya?

00:19.986 --> 00:21.386
You look a little tired.

00:21.420 --> 00:23.822
Actually, I'm... I'm great.

00:23.856 --> 00:26.258
I signed up for a prenatal class.

00:27.159 --> 00:29.060
I wish I could be there
with you right now.

00:29.567 --> 00:30.562
Me too.

00:33.232 --> 00:34.599
(Mongolian music)

00:37.570 --> 00:39.170
(Camels bellow)

00:40.740 --> 00:42.674
(Mongolian music)

00:48.281 --> 00:49.948
(Jeep rumbles)

00:53.452 --> 00:55.654
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

00:57.890 --> 00:59.791

01:08.370 --> 01:10.201
Tim: No. There's no way!

01:10.236 --> 01:11.570
It's not happening.

01:11.604 --> 01:13.838
Dad, it's a job.
I signed up for it months ago.

01:13.873 --> 01:15.273
I'm not gonna let them down!

01:15.308 --> 01:16.675
When you signed up months ago

01:16.709 --> 01:17.675
you weren't six months pregnant.

01:17.757 --> 01:19.477
How can you teach a clinic?

01:19.512 --> 01:21.622
- You're not even allowed to ride.
- I don't need to ride, okay?

01:21.705 --> 01:22.490
It's a Liberty clinic.

01:22.552 --> 01:24.805
I can do ground work,
and Karen knows I'm pregnant.

01:24.909 --> 01:26.149
- She's fine with it.
- She's fine with it?

01:26.252 --> 01:27.781
I'm not fine with it!

01:27.905 --> 01:29.354
(Exasperated sigh) Dad.

01:29.389 --> 01:30.241
You really need to stop this

01:30.324 --> 01:31.750
over protective thing
you've got going on.

01:31.853 --> 01:32.825
It's driving me crazy.

01:32.949 --> 01:35.360
I bet you haven't told Ty about this.

01:35.395 --> 01:39.231
No,
but he has enough on his plate already.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.665
Dad, I've got a really busy morning.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.067
I've got to get to the doctor

01:42.101 --> 01:43.435
before I can even leave for this clinic.

01:43.469 --> 01:44.870
Good. Good.

01:44.904 --> 01:46.238
You ask her what she thinks
of you doing a clinic.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.306
- I will.
- She'll say you're crazy.

01:48.341 --> 01:50.142
(Sighs) (Door slams shut)

01:50.176 --> 01:51.910
Just do what Amy does.

01:51.944 --> 01:53.478
It's like a dance.

01:53.513 --> 01:55.680
I know how to dance. I take lessons!

01:55.715 --> 01:57.849
Really! (Giggles)

01:57.884 --> 01:59.251
(Sings) Ta da!

02:00.620 --> 02:02.454
And plie! (Giggles)

02:02.488 --> 02:03.855
Good job!

02:03.890 --> 02:06.358
(Truck rumbles) (Horn honks)

02:06.392 --> 02:08.860
Amy: Hey, Katie!

02:08.895 --> 02:12.397
Katie: Amy, look! Monty likes to dance!

02:12.432 --> 02:15.033
Georgie: Show her your dance moves!

02:15.067 --> 02:17.302
Hey! (Monty snorts)

02:17.336 --> 02:18.670
(Panicked gasps)

02:18.704 --> 02:20.071
Monty! No!

02:20.106 --> 02:22.207
Georgie: Monty! (Whistles)

02:22.241 --> 02:23.942
Ow!

02:23.976 --> 02:25.877
- You okay?
- I hurt my knee!

02:25.912 --> 02:28.380
Okay, just stay there. I'll get Monty.

02:28.414 --> 02:30.215
No!

02:30.249 --> 02:31.750
(Worried gasp)

02:31.784 --> 02:33.118
Katie...

02:33.152 --> 02:34.553
Well, I agree with ya.

02:34.587 --> 02:36.087
I don't think Amy should be draggin'
a trailer

02:36.122 --> 02:37.789
through the mountains on her own either,

02:37.824 --> 02:40.025
but haven't you heard of a thing called

02:40.059 --> 02:41.426
reverse psychology?

02:41.461 --> 02:43.728
The more you tell Amy she can't go,

02:43.763 --> 02:46.364
the more she's gonna push to do it.

02:46.399 --> 02:49.201
So, I'm supposed to tell her she can go.

02:49.235 --> 02:50.602
What kind of sense does that make?

02:50.636 --> 02:52.938
(Cell phone chimes)

02:54.540 --> 02:55.907
Look, hey, I got a text from Lou.

02:55.942 --> 02:57.309
Uh?

02:57.343 --> 02:58.710
(Reading) "Big rainstorm in New York.

02:58.744 --> 03:01.780
Flights are backed up and delayed."

03:01.814 --> 03:04.282
Does not know "when she will arrive."

03:04.317 --> 03:05.951
When's Peter supposed to get here?

03:05.985 --> 03:08.520
Oh, sometime this afternoon. I think.

03:08.554 --> 03:10.388
He was vague.

03:10.423 --> 03:12.624
As usual?

03:12.658 --> 03:14.626
So you and I get to
entertain the General

03:14.660 --> 03:17.329
until Lou gets here,
and who knows when that'll be.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.164
That's just fantastic.

03:19.198 --> 03:20.599
I don't know.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.667
Maybe the less time
those two spend together

03:22.702 --> 03:25.904
under one roof the better, considering.

03:26.733 --> 03:28.707
Considering what?

03:28.741 --> 03:30.442
Oh, nothin'.

03:33.346 --> 03:35.747
- Monty!
- Wait for me, Georgie!

03:37.783 --> 03:39.751
Mitch! Monty won't come back

03:39.785 --> 03:41.586
and he's going to fall
in the pond and drown!

03:41.621 --> 03:42.954
He doesn't know how to swim!

03:42.989 --> 03:44.389
You stay with Georgie. I'll get him!

03:44.423 --> 03:45.824
(Monty squeals)

03:47.226 --> 03:48.927
Hey, whoa, whoa! Monty! Hiya!

03:48.961 --> 03:50.362
Come here! Get back here!

03:50.396 --> 03:51.997
(Monty snorts)

03:52.031 --> 03:54.266
Hey, come here!

03:54.300 --> 03:56.334
Easy, easy!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wha...

03:56.369 --> 03:58.136
(Monty squeals) Whoa! Whoa! Come on!

03:58.170 --> 04:00.639
(Relieved sigh)

04:00.673 --> 04:02.374
Here you go. Here's your little monster.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.709
Monty, never do that again!

04:04.744 --> 04:06.144
Bad!

04:06.178 --> 04:07.546
Thanks, Mitch.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.914
I'm just glad I could help.

04:08.948 --> 04:10.348
Thank you! You saved Monty's life!

04:10.383 --> 04:12.951
Mitch: (Chuckles)

04:12.985 --> 04:14.586
(Pants)

04:19.190 --> 04:20.926
(Truck rumbles)

04:27.500 --> 04:30.468
Ty:
I discovered that I'm okay on my own,

04:30.503 --> 04:33.104
but I know something else, too...

04:34.674 --> 04:37.042
I don't want to do it on my own.

04:37.076 --> 04:39.411
Amy, I wanna do it with you.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.246
Okay?

04:41.280 --> 04:42.847
Okay.

04:48.921 --> 04:50.255
(Sighs heavily)

05:01.386 --> 05:03.401
Amy: I have a gift for you too.

05:03.436 --> 05:05.403
- You do?
- I do.

05:05.438 --> 05:06.871
What have you got?

05:08.441 --> 05:10.775
You're gonna be a father.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.411
(Laugh happily) Ty: Really?

05:15.581 --> 05:16.915
(Sniffs sadly)

05:16.949 --> 05:18.316
(Jeep rumbles)

05:23.456 --> 05:25.457
(Loud bangs) Easy!

05:25.491 --> 05:27.192
You tryin' to hit every pot hole?

05:27.226 --> 05:28.593
It's hard to miss 'em!

05:28.628 --> 05:30.495
Both: (Laugh)

05:36.235 --> 05:37.736
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.137
Yeah, yeah.

05:41.774 --> 05:44.676
Whoa.

We can listen. We can
listen a lot better

06:53.946 --> 06:56.214
if you just put your guns down.

06:57.285 --> 06:59.150
Are you doctors?

06:59.185 --> 07:01.152
- Yeah.
- Yes.

07:01.187 --> 07:03.154
Yeah, we're, we're animal doctors.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.160
A bear's been shot.

07:10.663 --> 07:12.330
A female.

07:12.364 --> 07:13.998
We saw it happen.

07:14.033 --> 07:15.967
We fired at the hunter,

07:16.001 --> 07:19.204
frightened him away, and his guide,

07:19.238 --> 07:21.909
but the bear is still there.

07:22.885 --> 07:24.442
Dead.

07:24.477 --> 07:25.844
There was a cub.

07:25.878 --> 07:27.679
It ran away.

07:27.713 --> 07:29.114
Maybe wounded.

07:29.148 --> 07:31.182
Can, can you take us there?

07:31.217 --> 07:33.936
(Speaking in Mongolian)

07:35.054 --> 07:36.721
Money?

07:36.756 --> 07:38.389
(Sighs)

07:38.424 --> 07:41.226
No, we don't...
we don't travel with any money.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.694
Are you sure? No money?

07:42.728 --> 07:44.129
No money, man!

07:46.766 --> 07:49.134
It's okay... man.

07:51.670 --> 07:53.004
(Speaks in Mongolian)

07:53.038 --> 07:54.439
Ty: No, wait!

07:54.473 --> 07:55.726
Wait, we can pay you later, all right?

07:55.776 --> 07:57.925
Just tell us where the bear
is so we can find the cub!

08:00.980 --> 08:03.014
We wanna help!

Tim: So, Amy, your doctor's appointment.
How'd it go?

08:14.460 --> 08:16.361
Really good. Yeah, everything's normal

08:16.395 --> 08:18.963
and just so you know, I asked her

08:18.998 --> 08:23.802
and she's totally fine with
me going to the clinic today.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.637
Okay, good. You should go.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.038
(Laughs)

08:27.072 --> 08:29.407
Why did you change your mind?

08:29.441 --> 08:31.309
You're a grown woman.
You can make your own decisions.

08:31.343 --> 08:32.744
Thanks, Dad!

08:32.778 --> 08:34.611
You know how refreshing it
is to hear you say that?

08:37.750 --> 08:39.583
Tim: Reverse psychology, please!

08:39.618 --> 08:41.019
Amy, listen to me.

08:41.053 --> 08:42.720
You are not driving into
the mountains pregnant!

08:42.755 --> 08:44.255
What happened to me
making my own decision?

08:44.290 --> 08:45.824
Tim: Yeah, well forget that, okay?

08:45.858 --> 08:48.026
I'm gonna change my schedule.
I'll drive. No arguments.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.394
Georgie: I can go too,

08:49.428 --> 08:51.462
just in case any of the
horses need to be ridden.

Jack: Remember your Dad's comin' today.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.233
Georgie: Well,
I'll just see him when I get back.

08:55.267 --> 08:57.302
Amy: Why does everyone have
to make this so complicated?

08:57.336 --> 09:01.472
Amy, your Dad and Georgie
just offered to help you out.

09:01.507 --> 09:05.243
- Why don't you take advantage of it?
- Okay, fine!

09:05.277 --> 09:07.712
(Slams bottle down) Jeez!

09:07.746 --> 09:09.547
You're welcome.

09:12.318 --> 09:13.651
Amy: Let's go.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.220
(Hooves clop)

09:15.254 --> 09:16.621
Come on!

09:16.655 --> 09:18.690

09:18.724 --> 09:20.592
Tim: Come on, let's get goin'! (Claps)

09:20.626 --> 09:22.093
Amy, what time do you have to be there?

09:22.127 --> 09:24.462
We have plenty of time to get there,
Dad, just relax,

09:24.496 --> 09:26.464
and I don't know why we're bringing hay.

09:26.498 --> 09:27.832
They have plenty there!

09:27.867 --> 09:29.500
You never know these things.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.402
- Thank you.
- You're welcome!

09:31.437 --> 09:33.938
Oh and there's more sandwiches
and fruit in there...

09:33.973 --> 09:35.715
'Cause I know how hungry you get.

09:35.748 --> 09:37.475
Thank you, you two,
but you didn't have to do this.

09:37.509 --> 09:38.843
I am not an invalid!

09:38.878 --> 09:40.245
Can everybody please remember that?!

09:40.279 --> 09:42.347
- Yeah, you're not an invalid.
- (Frustrated groan)

09:42.381 --> 09:44.349
Dad, really? Four hours of this?

09:44.383 --> 09:46.184
- Bye. Let's get goin'.
- All right.

09:46.218 --> 09:47.685
- See ya.
- All right.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.320
Safe travels!

09:49.355 --> 09:51.623
- Come on.
- Okay, okay!

09:51.657 --> 09:54.359
- Are you on there?
- See ya.

09:54.393 --> 09:56.294
(Truck rumbles)

09:59.665 --> 10:01.532
Okay, what do you say you and me,
we go inside,

10:01.567 --> 10:04.903
we figure out what to make
your Dad and Mom for dinner?

10:04.937 --> 10:06.471
Mitch: (Clicks tongue) (Hooves clop)

10:06.505 --> 10:07.872
Mitch!

10:07.907 --> 10:09.407
Hey, kiddo!

10:10.876 --> 10:12.543
(Playful grunt)

10:12.578 --> 10:14.512
Hey, I'll watch her, Jack. No worries.

10:16.649 --> 10:18.016
(Clicks tongeue) (Monty snorts)

10:18.050 --> 10:19.450

10:19.485 --> 10:20.818
(Mongolian music)

10:24.189 --> 10:26.157
It all looks the same.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.027
We gotta keep going.

10:31.430 --> 10:33.731
It's like a needle in a haystack.

10:41.674 --> 10:44.075
(Truck rumbles)

10:47.146 --> 10:48.579
(Truck rumbles)

10:52.051 --> 10:54.352
(Truck rumbles to a stop) (Door opens)

10:54.386 --> 10:56.020
Amy! (Truck turns off)

10:56.055 --> 10:59.257
Karen, it is so nice to see you again.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.725
Yes, it's been a while.

11:00.759 --> 11:02.560
There have been some changes.

11:02.594 --> 11:04.429
- You look fabulous!
- (Chuckles) Thanks.

11:04.463 --> 11:05.830
Hey, let me help you with your horse.

11:05.864 --> 11:08.499
Oh, that's okay.
I have plenty of extra help.

11:08.534 --> 11:10.101
This is Georgie, my niece.

11:10.135 --> 11:11.536
Hi, nice to meet you.

11:11.570 --> 11:12.937
Amy: And my Dad, Tim.

11:12.972 --> 11:14.305
Tim: Hi. Tim Fleming.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.740
Good to meet you both.

11:15.774 --> 11:17.241
Hey, I had a, uh, an old rodeo buddy

11:17.276 --> 11:19.143
named Marty Shannon
that lived on this road.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.578
Do you know if he's still here?

11:20.612 --> 11:22.480
He is. I know him and
his wife really well.

11:22.514 --> 11:24.816
Amy: Dad, you should go see your buddy.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.184
No, you need me here.

11:26.218 --> 11:27.585
Amy: No, actually I'm good,

11:27.619 --> 11:29.420
and you're gonna be
bored out of your mind.

11:29.455 --> 11:31.022
You hate clinics. (Doors open)

11:31.056 --> 11:32.457
Well, hate's a strong word, honey.

11:32.491 --> 11:35.426
Dad, just go see your friend.
You can pick us up after.

11:35.461 --> 11:36.861
We'll text you when we're done.

11:36.895 --> 11:38.262
(Hooves thud on metal ramp)

11:38.297 --> 11:39.664
You sure?

11:39.698 --> 11:41.199
Positive.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.101
Go.

11:43.135 --> 11:44.502
(Laughs)

11:45.938 --> 11:47.739
(Spartan snorts)

11:47.773 --> 11:50.908
Good boy, Spartan. (Clicks tongue)

11:50.943 --> 11:52.343
(Whistles)

11:52.378 --> 11:53.711
(Whip whips)

11:53.746 --> 11:55.113
(Clicks tongue)

11:56.548 --> 11:57.915
(Whip whips)

11:57.950 --> 11:59.350
(Spartan snorts)

11:59.385 --> 12:00.651
(Clicks tongue)

12:02.087 --> 12:03.855
(Spartan snorts)

12:03.889 --> 12:05.256
(Clicks tongue)

12:05.290 --> 12:06.691
(Whistles)

12:09.094 --> 12:11.763
The goal of today's
clinic is to build a bond

12:11.797 --> 12:15.633
and create a strong and honest
connection with your horse.

12:15.667 --> 12:17.101
Now we form this connection

12:17.136 --> 12:18.669
through the use of Liberty work.

12:18.704 --> 12:20.238
In my opinion, Liberty training

12:20.272 --> 12:22.640
is the foundation of everything!

12:24.877 --> 12:26.544
(Light tapping) Lie down.

12:26.578 --> 12:29.347
Good boy.

12:29.381 --> 12:32.016
Students: (Laugh and clap)

12:32.051 --> 12:33.418
Wow.

12:34.853 --> 12:36.220
(Taxi rumbles)

12:44.863 --> 12:46.230
(Door opens)

12:48.567 --> 12:49.934
(Door shuts)

12:51.403 --> 12:53.504
Katie:
(Chatters happily) (Taxi rumbles away)

12:53.539 --> 12:55.139
Okay!

12:56.708 --> 12:58.176
Peter: Knock, knock.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.644
Daddy!

12:59.678 --> 13:01.012
(Laughing) Hi!

13:01.046 --> 13:02.447
- Hah!
- Hey, Kitty Kat!

13:02.481 --> 13:03.815
- (Happy squeal)
- (Playful grunt)

13:03.849 --> 13:05.650
(Playful snuggling)

13:05.684 --> 13:07.185
Uh, hi, Peter.

13:08.587 --> 13:10.021
Hey.

13:10.055 --> 13:12.323
Mitch, right?

13:12.357 --> 13:15.026
Katie: Daddy, look at Monty!
Isn't he beautiful?

13:15.060 --> 13:16.928
Yeah, yeah, he sure is.

13:16.962 --> 13:21.032
That is one fancy-dancy
hair-do he's go there too!

13:21.066 --> 13:22.767
I got an idea:
Why don't we saddle him up,

13:22.801 --> 13:24.135
I'll take you on a pony ride?

13:24.169 --> 13:26.237
I don't do pony rides anymore, Daddy.

13:26.271 --> 13:27.839
Oh, well, okay then,

13:27.873 --> 13:30.141
let's go on a real ride. How about that?

13:30.175 --> 13:34.345
You don't know anything about
riding horses. Mitch does!

13:34.379 --> 13:37.548
Mitch saved Monty's life this morning.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.250
Well, not, not exactly.

13:39.284 --> 13:40.651
He did, Daddy. (Monty whinnies)

13:40.686 --> 13:42.420
Peter: I'm sure he did.

13:42.454 --> 13:44.522
I'm sure he did. I believe you.

13:44.556 --> 13:46.757
Hey, why don't you come inside with me,
okay? Help me unpack.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.127
No, I want to stay here with Mitch.

13:50.596 --> 13:51.963
Okay.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.434
(Water flows)

13:57.836 --> 13:59.537
(Door opens and closes)

14:01.406 --> 14:03.074
(Water stops) Peter! How are ya?

14:03.108 --> 14:05.710
Hey. Good, good.

14:05.744 --> 14:07.778
(Hands clap together)

14:07.813 --> 14:10.615
- So, how was your flight?
- Oh, it was good, you know.

14:10.649 --> 14:11.983
Up and down. (Small chuckle)

14:12.017 --> 14:13.417
Yeah, well.

14:13.452 --> 14:14.785
Better luck than Lou.

14:14.820 --> 14:17.622
- Why's that?
- Ah, a big storm down East.

14:17.656 --> 14:19.123
It's messin' up all the flights

14:19.158 --> 14:21.058
- from New York there.
- Oh.

14:21.093 --> 14:22.994
Um, Georgie around?

14:23.028 --> 14:25.563
Yeah, well, Georgie, she's helpin' Amy

14:25.597 --> 14:27.798
with a clinic up in the Kananaskis,

14:27.833 --> 14:30.635
but Katie's here. Did you see her?

14:30.669 --> 14:32.737
Yeah. Yeah, she's, she's out in the barn

14:32.771 --> 14:35.072
with that ranch hand. Um...

14:35.107 --> 14:37.775
Uh, so look,
I'll just throw my stuff in Amy's room

14:37.809 --> 14:39.143
until I know where I'm stayin'.
Is that...

14:39.178 --> 14:41.345
Uh, yeah, yeah, that's good, yeah.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.047
Thanks.

14:45.951 --> 14:47.351
This is Darby.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.819
Now I was speaking with Darby's owner,
Helen,

14:48.854 --> 14:50.354
before the clinic, and she told me

14:50.389 --> 14:52.990
he is almost impossible
to collect from the field.

14:53.025 --> 14:54.825
So, we're gonna work with him today

14:54.860 --> 14:58.262
to see if we can get him over that.

14:58.297 --> 14:59.697
I've brought along Georgie.

14:59.731 --> 15:02.099
Now Georgie is incredible with horses,

15:02.134 --> 15:04.569
but like you guys,
she's new to Liberty work.

15:04.603 --> 15:06.003
She's just learning.

15:06.038 --> 15:08.573
So, Georgie,
now that he's kind of with you,

15:08.607 --> 15:11.609
I want you to bring him
in and unclip his lead.

15:11.643 --> 15:13.077
Whoa.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.982
Now see if you can do the same thing,

15:18.016 --> 15:20.318
but with him going around you freely.

15:20.352 --> 15:21.953
(Clicks tongue) (Hooves thud)

15:21.987 --> 15:23.554
That's it.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.489
(Clicks tongue)

15:25.524 --> 15:28.426
- There you go.
- (Clicks tongue)

15:28.460 --> 15:30.328
Amy: You're turning into him a little.

15:30.362 --> 15:32.296
Keep your body open to him.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.065
Georgie: (Clicks tongue)

15:34.099 --> 15:36.467
(Whip whips)

15:36.501 --> 15:38.302
(Clicks tongue)

15:38.337 --> 15:40.438
Now see this,
he is feeding off her body language

15:40.472 --> 15:41.906
and he's with her now,

15:41.940 --> 15:44.709
paying attention to all
of her cues and signals.

15:44.743 --> 15:46.711
(Hooves thud)

15:46.745 --> 15:48.913
(Clicks tongue) (Whip whips)

15:48.947 --> 15:50.514
(Darby snorts)

15:50.549 --> 15:52.617
Now when Helen or someone else

15:52.651 --> 15:54.252
goes to the field to collect him,

15:54.286 --> 15:55.853
Darby should be more willing to listen,

15:55.887 --> 15:58.689
because he's aware of those
simple and subtle cues

15:58.724 --> 16:00.124
that she's giving him.

16:00.158 --> 16:01.859
Okay, Georgie,

16:01.893 --> 16:04.295
when you're ready call him into you.

16:05.764 --> 16:07.098
Now that doesn't look like a horse

16:07.132 --> 16:08.532
that's gonna run away, does it?

16:08.567 --> 16:10.901
Students: (Chuckle) (Darby snorts)

16:10.936 --> 16:12.403
Perfect. Now I want you to
back away from him slowly,

16:12.437 --> 16:16.507
but use your body language
to keep him there.

16:16.535 --> 16:18.209
- Whoa.
- Amy: He's paying attention to you.

16:18.243 --> 16:20.077
He's focused. This is good.

16:31.123 --> 16:33.124
Okay, now call him to you.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.759
Okay. (Clicks tongue)

16:34.793 --> 16:36.327
(Clicks tongue)

16:36.361 --> 16:38.262
- Good boy.
- (Clicks tongue)

16:38.297 --> 16:40.665
- Good boy!
- Students: (Murmur excitedly)

16:40.699 --> 16:42.099
Amy: That's it.

16:42.134 --> 16:43.868
Amy and Georgie: (Laugh)

16:43.902 --> 16:46.037
Hey, bud.

16:46.071 --> 16:47.438
(Clapping)

16:47.472 --> 16:49.407
- Woo!
- Great job!

16:49.441 --> 16:51.142
(Jeep rumbles)

16:55.814 --> 16:57.348
Hey, hey, Ty, stop!

16:57.382 --> 16:59.417
(Jeep rumbles to a stop)

17:03.155 --> 17:04.689
(Jeep turns off)

17:09.861 --> 17:12.396
I don't know.
Does that look interesting?

17:17.234 --> 17:18.803
Well, it's somethin'.

17:18.837 --> 17:20.771
Let's check it out.

17:23.175 --> 17:26.676
(Hooves thud) (Truck rumbles to a stop)

17:26.712 --> 17:28.646
Woman: Amy?! (Door opens)

17:28.680 --> 17:30.648
- Amy Fleming?!
- Yes.

17:30.682 --> 17:32.817
(Door slams shut) Woman: Oh,
thank God you're still here!

17:32.851 --> 17:34.952
I am so sorry that I'm late!

17:34.986 --> 17:36.620
And the reason that I am late

17:36.655 --> 17:39.223
is the very problem that
I'm hoping you can solve.

17:39.257 --> 17:41.592
I'm sorry, but the clinic's over.

17:41.626 --> 17:42.993
No.

17:43.028 --> 17:44.428
No, no, no. You've got to help me.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.530
I'm desperate. Please!
Just look at my horse!

17:48.934 --> 17:50.634
(Truck rumbles)

17:52.137 --> 17:54.438
(Latch clanks) (Door squeaks open)

17:55.874 --> 17:57.241
(Horse snorts rapidly)

17:58.677 --> 18:00.044
(Horse snorts shrilly)

18:00.078 --> 18:01.379
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:01.413 --> 18:03.280
Hey!
(Grunts sharply) (Horse squeals loudly)

18:03.315 --> 18:04.682
Georgie: Amy!

18:04.716 --> 18:06.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:06.118 --> 18:08.252
Georgie: Amy!
Woman: Oh my God, are you okay?!

18:08.286 --> 18:10.121
Yeah. (Horse whinnies shrilly)

18:10.155 --> 18:11.522
That's it, come on.

18:11.556 --> 18:13.290
(Horse whinnies shrilly) Hey!

18:13.325 --> 18:15.559
Easy, easy, come on! (Horse shrieks)

18:15.594 --> 18:18.496
Come on! Settle down!
Settle! (Horse shrieks)

18:18.530 --> 18:20.798
Ooh! Yeah! (Horse snorts wildly)

18:20.832 --> 18:22.199
Whoa. (Horse squeals)

18:22.234 --> 18:24.201
See? He's unmanageable.

18:24.236 --> 18:26.036
My daughter and I can't
do anything with him!

18:26.071 --> 18:28.539
Tim: Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

18:28.573 --> 18:30.508
(Horse settles)

18:30.542 --> 18:32.810
What the heck's goin' on here?!

18:51.866 --> 18:53.900
Watch yourself.

18:53.935 --> 18:55.369
Yeah.

19:06.614 --> 19:08.415
(Sighs) Damn.

19:10.118 --> 19:12.052
(Grimaces)

19:17.759 --> 19:20.160
(Horse snorts) (Hooves thud)

19:23.965 --> 19:25.298
See that?

19:25.333 --> 19:26.700
The animal's crazy.

19:26.734 --> 19:28.101
And who knew?

19:28.136 --> 19:30.437
When my daughter and I
bought him he seemed perfect.

19:30.471 --> 19:31.872
(Hooves thud)

19:31.906 --> 19:33.273
He was calm. (Horse snorts wildly)

19:33.307 --> 19:34.975
He was easy to manage.

19:35.009 --> 19:36.643
And now he's the opposite...

19:36.678 --> 19:38.211
unpredictable,

19:38.246 --> 19:40.614
and just plain nasty!

19:40.648 --> 19:43.316
He bit my daughter last week.

19:43.351 --> 19:46.280
It's been my experience that

19:47.288 --> 19:48.722
sometimes certain horses

19:48.756 --> 19:50.891
are suited to certain owners.

19:50.925 --> 19:52.459
It's not always a horse problem.

19:52.493 --> 19:54.261
It's usually a people problem.

19:55.730 --> 19:57.064
(Huffs) Well...

19:57.816 --> 20:00.133
if anyone can fix this horse, you can.

20:00.168 --> 20:03.303
You're the miracle girl horse whisperer,
aren't you?

20:03.337 --> 20:05.706
Amy: From what you've described

20:05.740 --> 20:07.974
these things can't be solved
overnight or at a clinic.

20:08.009 --> 20:10.477
Woman:
You advertise as though that's the case!

20:10.511 --> 20:12.579
No, actually, I don't.

20:13.457 --> 20:15.348
Tim: Amy.

20:15.383 --> 20:16.750
Can I talk to you for a second?

20:16.784 --> 20:18.318
Excuse me.

20:20.922 --> 20:23.256
- Yeah.
- It's gettin' late.

20:23.291 --> 20:24.991
I don't want to drive in the dark.

20:25.026 --> 20:26.593
Get rid of this woman and her horse.

20:26.627 --> 20:28.995
Dad, I would like to go, too, but...

20:29.030 --> 20:31.198
You just tell her you can't do it,
not in your condition.

20:31.232 --> 20:33.333
In my condition? Really?

20:33.367 --> 20:34.735
(Annoyed sigh)

20:34.769 --> 20:36.136
(Horse snorts)

20:37.193 --> 20:38.939
Please, just...

20:39.987 --> 20:41.742
just work with him.

20:46.848 --> 20:48.248
(Flies buzz)

20:51.686 --> 20:55.021
Female, just like those guys said.

20:56.958 --> 20:58.458
Shot through the heart.

20:58.493 --> 21:00.560
Very professional.

21:05.994 --> 21:07.768
Hey. Look.

21:08.722 --> 21:10.537
Prints!

21:10.571 --> 21:11.938
Cub size.

21:11.973 --> 21:13.340
And blood.

21:14.776 --> 21:16.710
Looks like he was wounded and ran off.

21:16.744 --> 21:18.712
I guess our friends were
right about that too.

21:18.746 --> 21:21.047
Yeah. Let's grab some gear and track it.

21:21.082 --> 21:22.449
Yeah.

21:25.753 --> 21:28.555
I can't get Lou on the phone.
She's not answering.

21:28.589 --> 21:30.290
Well, maybe she's on a plane.

21:30.324 --> 21:31.858
That's a good thing, isn't it?

21:31.893 --> 21:33.260
I don't know.

21:33.294 --> 21:34.928
You don't know what?

21:34.962 --> 21:36.863
I think she's avoiding the issue.

21:36.898 --> 21:38.532
What issue? (Coffee flows)

21:39.648 --> 21:41.368
Divorce papers.

21:41.402 --> 21:43.270
Ah.

21:43.304 --> 21:44.871
That issue.

21:44.906 --> 21:47.340
Well, there's a storm in New York.

21:47.375 --> 21:50.544
That doesn't mean that
Lou's avoiding the issue.

21:50.578 --> 21:52.779
No, I've just been tryin'
to nail her down with this

21:52.814 --> 21:54.447
for a few weeks now though.

21:54.482 --> 21:57.050
I should have just
mailed the things to her.

21:57.084 --> 21:58.685
Although we did agree that
we were gonna sign them

21:58.719 --> 22:00.153
together in person.

22:00.188 --> 22:02.055
At least, I think we did.

22:02.089 --> 22:03.490
Well, it's tough when she's in New York.

22:03.524 --> 22:05.859
Well, yes. That's to be expected.

22:05.893 --> 22:07.527
She's pretty darn busy.

22:07.562 --> 22:08.929
She's still in touch with the girls

22:08.963 --> 22:10.330
on a daily basis, though.

22:10.364 --> 22:12.065
That hasn't changed.

22:12.099 --> 22:13.433
Well, that's good.

22:13.467 --> 22:15.135
So I'm the only one
she's out of touch with.

22:15.169 --> 22:17.103
(Exasperated chuckle)

22:17.138 --> 22:19.110
Can Mitch stay for dinner?

22:20.775 --> 22:22.142
Um...

22:22.176 --> 22:23.743
Jack: Well, your Dad's here.

22:23.778 --> 22:26.980
I think he'd like to have
you all to himself at dinner.

22:28.516 --> 22:30.417
- No fair.
- (Chuckles)

22:33.788 --> 22:35.121
(Clicks tongue)

22:36.724 --> 22:38.859
(Horse whinnies softly)

22:38.893 --> 22:41.094
(Clicks tongue)

22:41.128 --> 22:43.230
(Horse whinnies shrilly)

22:43.264 --> 22:45.031
(Horse snorts harshly)

22:46.801 --> 22:48.735
How long was he trailered for?

22:48.769 --> 22:50.871
Woman: Uh,
it took us a few hours to get here.

22:50.905 --> 22:53.840
Amy: Where do you keep him?
You have a ranch or...?

22:53.875 --> 22:55.390
In a stall.

22:55.407 --> 22:57.410
Amy: But you don't keep him in
a stall all the time, do you?

22:57.445 --> 22:58.845
Pretty much.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.114
He's not good with the
other horses in the field.

23:01.148 --> 23:03.116
(Sighs heavily)

23:03.150 --> 23:05.585
(Clicks tongue) (Horse snorts)

23:05.620 --> 23:06.987
Get up! (Clicks tongue)

23:07.021 --> 23:08.855
(Horse snorts sharply)

23:08.890 --> 23:10.357
(Hooves thud)

23:21.202 --> 23:22.769
(Gate clanks)

23:23.847 --> 23:25.805
She should be careful.

23:25.840 --> 23:28.475
(Lead rattles)

23:29.877 --> 23:31.511
(Horse snorts)

23:33.147 --> 23:35.482
(Horse whinnies softly)

23:42.556 --> 23:44.624
(Horse snorts)

23:44.659 --> 23:46.226
(Sighs)

23:49.363 --> 23:51.464
Whoa. He needs to run, Amy.

23:51.499 --> 23:54.167
He hates being cooped up in
a stall and in a trailer.

23:54.201 --> 23:56.369
We just need to let him run.

23:56.404 --> 23:58.538
Okay. Go for it.

24:00.007 --> 24:02.809
(Lead clatters)
- Okay.

24:02.843 --> 24:04.210
(Horse whinnies)

24:04.245 --> 24:06.046
(Clicks tongue)

24:06.080 --> 24:08.481
(Horse snorts) (Hooves thud)

24:09.917 --> 24:11.384
Get! (Clicks tongue)

24:12.820 --> 24:15.555
That's it, Georgie, keep him goin'.

24:17.258 --> 24:18.858
(Clicks tongue)

24:21.429 --> 24:24.197
I thought you were gonna get rid of her.

24:24.231 --> 24:26.166
Dad, I don't know what to say.

24:26.200 --> 24:28.601
- I will.
- No, please don't.

24:31.505 --> 24:33.673
Good boy.

24:33.708 --> 24:35.775
(Clicks tongue)

24:37.178 --> 24:38.878
(Hooves thud rhythmically)

24:38.913 --> 24:41.214
(Clicks tongue)

24:44.251 --> 24:46.720
(Horse snorts)

24:46.754 --> 24:48.388
(Hooves thud)

24:56.964 --> 24:58.431
Hoo...

24:58.466 --> 25:01.514
That was amazing!

25:02.603 --> 25:04.704
Absolutely amazing!

25:04.739 --> 25:06.439
Tim: It was absolutely amazing, Georgie.

25:06.474 --> 25:08.008
Great join up.

25:08.042 --> 25:09.743
Time to go!

25:09.777 --> 25:12.712
I realize miracles
don't happen overnight,

25:12.747 --> 25:14.180
but can I bring him to your ranch?

25:14.215 --> 25:17.384
I have read all about Heartland on-line.

25:17.418 --> 25:19.152
(Sighs)

25:20.223 --> 25:22.789
All right. I'll work with him.

25:23.695 --> 25:25.592
I'll bring my trailer closer.

25:25.626 --> 25:26.993
We'll have way more
trouble getting him into it

25:27.028 --> 25:29.396
than we did getting him out.

25:31.298 --> 25:33.066
(Gate clanks)

25:33.100 --> 25:34.534
(Horse snorts)

25:34.568 --> 25:37.683
Georgie, you were amazing!

25:37.782 --> 25:39.572
Thanks.

25:39.607 --> 25:41.474
How are you?

25:41.509 --> 25:42.909
I'm exhausted.

25:42.943 --> 25:44.778
Don't you dare tell my Dad! (Chuckles)

25:54.021 --> 25:55.555
You see anything?

25:55.589 --> 25:57.390
Nothin'.

25:58.517 --> 26:00.560
The blood trail's gone.

26:01.996 --> 26:03.663
The blood probably coagulated,

26:03.697 --> 26:05.565
which is great news for the cub.

26:05.599 --> 26:06.966
(Grunts with effort)

26:07.001 --> 26:08.401
So now what?

26:08.436 --> 26:09.803
Ty, look!

26:09.837 --> 26:11.471
(Cub calls out)

26:14.442 --> 26:15.942
(Cub calls out)

26:19.213 --> 26:20.847
- Come on!
- Okay!

26:20.881 --> 26:22.515
- Ah! Watch your step!
- Yeah.

26:22.550 --> 26:24.484
(Cub calls out)

26:24.518 --> 26:27.320
Georgie: I don't get it. Where is she?

26:27.354 --> 26:28.721
I don't know.

26:29.705 --> 26:32.859
This is ridiculous. Come on, let's load.

26:35.496 --> 26:36.963
(Hooves clop)

26:39.200 --> 26:40.867
She's gone?

26:42.970 --> 26:45.505
She left without her horse.

26:45.539 --> 26:48.575
- Call her.
- How? I don't have her number.

26:56.252 --> 26:57.840
Karen: This woman, whoever she was

26:57.877 --> 26:59.745
she didn't pre-register.

26:59.779 --> 27:01.980
Everyone on this list did
and they all attended.

27:02.015 --> 27:03.916
And because she came in
late she didn't sign in.

27:03.950 --> 27:05.617
- I guess not.
- I don't believe this.

27:05.652 --> 27:07.486
So there's no way of tracing her!

27:07.520 --> 27:11.156
I, I didn't even get her name,
or her horse's name.

27:11.191 --> 27:13.158
Okay, like I said it's time to go.

27:13.193 --> 27:14.826
We can't just leave this horse here.

27:14.861 --> 27:16.528
Amy:
Maybe this was a big misunderstanding.

27:16.563 --> 27:18.430
Maybe she thought that we were
taking her horse to Heartland.

27:18.464 --> 27:19.865
No, it wasn't a misunderstanding.

27:19.899 --> 27:22.901
The woman abandoned her horse. To you.

27:22.936 --> 27:26.238
Okay, so then he's my responsibility.

27:26.272 --> 27:27.906
We're taking him with us.

27:27.941 --> 27:29.374
Maybe she'll regret what she did

27:29.409 --> 27:32.244
and come and pick him up.
She knows where Heartland is.

27:32.278 --> 27:34.213
- I am sorry about this.
- Karen: It's not your fault

27:34.247 --> 27:35.714
there are crazies in this world.

27:35.748 --> 27:38.617
I promise if I hear anything
about this mystery woman

27:38.651 --> 27:40.018
I'll let you know.

27:40.053 --> 27:41.587
- Thanks, Karen.
- Karen: Mm-hm.

27:42.384 --> 27:44.423
Thanks. Come on.

27:44.457 --> 27:45.991
(Cub calls out)

27:49.295 --> 27:50.796
(Brush rustles)

27:53.933 --> 27:55.701
Come on!

27:57.303 --> 27:58.637
(Cub calls out)

28:10.597 --> 28:12.084
Where'd he go?

28:12.118 --> 28:13.552
I don't know.

28:15.955 --> 28:17.322
(Horse whinnies shrilly)

28:17.357 --> 28:18.890
- Amy: Dad!
- Whoa, whoa. Back. Stay back!

28:18.925 --> 28:20.292
(Horse whinnies shrilly) Whoa, whoa!

28:20.326 --> 28:22.227
Dad, I know you're in a hurry,
okay, please!

28:22.262 --> 28:23.350
Wait! Get back.

28:23.383 --> 28:25.931
Amy: You're stressing him out!
Just let Georgie do it.

28:25.965 --> 28:27.933
(Horse whinnies shrilly)

28:29.936 --> 28:31.570
(Horse whinnies shrilly) Georgie...

28:31.604 --> 28:33.438
Whoa, bud. Whoa. Whoa.

28:36.476 --> 28:38.928
It's okay. Hey, hey.

28:39.812 --> 28:41.179
Hey.

28:42.615 --> 28:44.449
(Horse snorts restlessly)

28:46.121 --> 28:47.753
You're okay.

28:49.246 --> 28:51.990
Come on.

28:52.025 --> 28:53.425
Good boy.

28:53.459 --> 28:54.826
Up.

28:54.861 --> 28:56.161
Good.

29:02.168 --> 29:04.603
(Internal door squeaks and shuts)

29:06.472 --> 29:09.308
Tim: Okay, I got him, I got him.

29:09.342 --> 29:11.910
I got him. Come on, boy.
Good boy, Spartan.

29:11.944 --> 29:13.745
Tim: Come on, boy. That a boy.

29:13.780 --> 29:15.147
That's it.

29:16.816 --> 29:18.150
Okay.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.988
(Door bangs shut)

29:23.022 --> 29:24.389
(Grimaces)

29:24.424 --> 29:25.924
Okay.

29:25.958 --> 29:28.627
- What? What is it? Amy?
- Nothing I'm...

29:30.029 --> 29:31.396
It's just a little twinge. I'm okay.

29:31.431 --> 29:33.598
I warned you about gettin'
near the horses today.

29:33.633 --> 29:35.434
I warned ya!

29:35.468 --> 29:37.235
- I'm fine.
- Okay...

29:37.270 --> 29:39.171
All right, it's gettin' late.
I'm gonna take a back road.

29:39.205 --> 29:40.939
It'll be a lot faster than takin'
the highway.

29:40.973 --> 29:43.263
Okay. I'm good.

29:44.110 --> 29:46.144
(Pants)

29:50.083 --> 29:51.650
(Truck rumbles)

29:56.055 --> 29:58.190
You know,
Tim should be on his way back by now,

29:58.224 --> 30:01.727
but I can't seem to get a hold of any of
'em.

30:01.761 --> 30:03.662
Let's eat. The bar-bq's on.

30:04.729 --> 30:06.732
Wait, wait, wait. Toronto?

30:06.766 --> 30:09.301
Lou, what are you doing in Toronto?
I thought...

30:09.335 --> 30:10.731
No, I had two days off!

30:10.781 --> 30:12.871
I thought you wanted to sign
these divorce papers together.

30:12.905 --> 30:14.406
Is that not what we...?

30:15.311 --> 30:17.743
Okay. Yeah.
No, I know it's not your fault.

30:17.777 --> 30:20.569
Okay. Next flight. Yeah. Bye.

30:21.081 --> 30:22.948
Mitch! Please, please, GG,

30:22.982 --> 30:25.050
say that Mitch can stay for dinner!

30:25.084 --> 30:27.853
Um, here's the invoice
for the feed I picked up.

30:27.887 --> 30:29.554
Please!

30:29.589 --> 30:30.956
Sorry, kiddo, I already ate.

30:30.990 --> 30:32.324
Katie: (Sad sound)

30:33.166 --> 30:34.770
See ya.

30:38.798 --> 30:41.166
That was kinda sneaky, wasn't it?

30:41.200 --> 30:43.201
You heard me when I
said no the first time.

30:43.236 --> 30:45.237
You need to spend some
time with your Dad.

30:45.271 --> 30:47.272
I don't want to spend
time with my Daddy.

30:47.306 --> 30:49.174
I want to spend time with Mitch!

30:49.208 --> 30:52.444
Jack: Well guess who you're
gonna spend time with? Nobody.

30:52.478 --> 30:54.579
You can go to your room right now.

30:54.614 --> 30:56.047
Katie: Hmm.

31:01.554 --> 31:03.255
(Truck rumbles)

31:03.289 --> 31:04.756
(Birds chirp)

31:08.094 --> 31:09.895
(Truck hums)

31:13.332 --> 31:15.133
Georgie: Was that lady crazy or what?

31:15.168 --> 31:16.501
(Chuckles)

31:16.536 --> 31:17.936
Loopy as they come.

31:17.970 --> 31:19.304
Dad! Look out!!

31:19.338 --> 31:20.739
(Truck rumbles) (Tires screech)

31:20.773 --> 31:22.107
(Horses squeal)

31:22.141 --> 31:23.508
(Loud banging)

31:23.543 --> 31:24.910
(Huge bang)
- Ah!

31:24.944 --> 31:26.311
(Rocks thunder) Amy: Dad, look out!

31:26.345 --> 31:27.712
(Trailer screeches)

31:27.747 --> 31:30.081
(Glass shattering bang) All: (Scream)

31:30.116 --> 31:32.384
(Horses squeal) (Boulder thunders)

31:32.418 --> 31:34.019
(Gravel crunches)

31:35.488 --> 31:37.289
(Thunderous bangs)

31:43.662 --> 31:45.830
(Laboured breathing)

31:47.966 --> 31:50.034
(Grunts) - (Grunts)

31:50.068 --> 31:51.603
(Grimaces) Tim: Amy, talk to me.

31:51.702 --> 31:53.207
- Yeah.
- Amy.

31:53.305 --> 31:54.672
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

31:54.706 --> 31:56.107
Georgie?

31:56.141 --> 31:57.508
I'm, I'm good.

31:57.543 --> 31:58.910
The baby?

31:58.944 --> 32:01.479
Yes! Good, uh...

32:01.513 --> 32:03.881
Tim: Okay, careful. (Door bangs open)

32:03.916 --> 32:05.483
(Grimaces)

32:05.517 --> 32:06.884
(Grunts)

32:06.919 --> 32:08.352
Uh! Ah...

32:08.387 --> 32:10.488
Ah! Amy: Dad! (Grunts)

32:10.522 --> 32:12.590
Dad!

32:12.624 --> 32:13.991
You gonna be okay?

32:14.026 --> 32:15.393
- (Grunts and grimaces)
- Hey.

32:15.427 --> 32:16.861
- I'm sorry. I'm fine.
- (Pants)

32:17.867 --> 32:19.664
Oh my God.

32:25.037 --> 32:27.772
Be careful. (Door bangs shut)

32:27.806 --> 32:28.563
Be careful. (Horse whinnies sharply)

32:28.630 --> 32:30.208
Spartan!

32:30.242 --> 32:31.576
- Oh, we've gotta get them out!
- Amy! Amy, slow down!

32:31.610 --> 32:32.977
Georgie: Amy, wait!

32:33.012 --> 32:34.379
Tim: Girls, be careful!

32:34.413 --> 32:36.014
(Horse whinnies) Georgie: Stop! Stop!

32:36.048 --> 32:37.816
It's okay. We're gonna get you.

32:37.850 --> 32:39.217
(Horse whinnies) We're
gonna get you out.

32:39.251 --> 32:40.985
(Grimaces and grunts)

32:41.020 --> 32:42.654
Georgie: It's all right!
(Horses bang and whinny)

32:42.688 --> 32:45.090
- You girls, girls...
- Hey, bud. It's okay.

32:45.124 --> 32:47.125
- It's okay. Whoo...
- Careful! Careful!

32:47.159 --> 32:48.560
Amy: You're all right. (Horse snorts)

32:48.594 --> 32:49.961
You're good.

32:49.995 --> 32:52.664
Easy, Spartan. Easy, easy. Easy!

32:52.698 --> 32:53.998
- You're okay.
- Good boy!

32:54.033 --> 32:55.400
- He looks okay.
- Here, I've got him.

32:55.434 --> 32:57.869
Good boy. (Thudding footsteps)

32:59.472 --> 33:00.839
(Latch clanks) (Horse
whinnies in distress)

33:00.873 --> 33:04.109
(Grunts with effort)
(Metal bangs loudly)

33:04.143 --> 33:05.477
(Grunts with effort)
(Metal bangs loudly)

33:05.511 --> 33:07.579
(Hooves thud violently)

33:07.613 --> 33:08.980
Dad, he doesn't look good.

33:09.014 --> 33:10.381
(Grunts loudly) (Loud metallic bang)

33:10.416 --> 33:11.883
Amy: He really doesn't!
- (Grimaces)

33:11.917 --> 33:13.318
What's goin' on? Are you okay?

33:13.352 --> 33:15.854
- Yeah I'm fine, Amy, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

33:15.888 --> 33:17.222
Yeah, it's nothin'.

33:17.256 --> 33:18.623
Just get out of the trailer.
It's not safe.

33:18.657 --> 33:20.024
Dad...

33:20.059 --> 33:22.560
(Horse kicks violently) (Shrieks wildly)

33:23.963 --> 33:25.330
(Pants)

33:25.364 --> 33:26.898
(Grimaces)

33:29.802 --> 33:31.803
(Horse snorts and bangs)

33:33.806 --> 33:35.707
(Grunts with effort)
(Loud metallic bang)

33:35.741 --> 33:37.475
(Grunts with effort)
- Dad!

33:37.510 --> 33:38.910
(Grunts with effort)
(Loud metallic bang)

33:38.944 --> 33:40.311
(Grunts with effort)
(Loud metallic bang)

33:40.346 --> 33:41.713
Amy: Dad!

33:41.747 --> 33:44.115
Amy, get out of the trailer!

33:44.150 --> 33:45.049
If I get this I don't want him
to fly out and trample you!

33:45.084 --> 33:46.818
Okay!

33:46.852 --> 33:49.254
(Grimaces and gasps)

33:49.288 --> 33:51.823
There's gotta be another way!

33:53.259 --> 33:54.993
Listen... I tried that!

33:55.027 --> 33:56.394
That's, that's jammed!

33:56.428 --> 33:57.795
It's not gonna open. I tried it!

33:57.830 --> 33:59.197
(Grunts with effort)

33:59.231 --> 34:01.199
Get away! Amy, please get back. Honey...

34:01.233 --> 34:02.567
(Rocks clatter) Dad,
we've gotta do something!

34:02.601 --> 34:03.968
- Honey, honey, honey.
- I've gotta get him out!

34:04.003 --> 34:06.171
Georgie, get away from the rock slide!

34:06.205 --> 34:07.572
(Gasps nervously)

34:07.606 --> 34:08.973
Come on!

34:09.007 --> 34:10.408
(Horse shrieks and
bangs) (Clicks tongue)

34:10.442 --> 34:11.909
Can, can we still drive it out?

34:11.944 --> 34:14.212
No, no,
we're not going anywhere in that.

34:14.246 --> 34:15.612
(Pants)

34:15.648 --> 34:17.248
Just, just, just get back.
Please, both of you.

34:17.283 --> 34:19.250
(Horse whinnies in pain)

34:22.821 --> 34:24.455
Nothing.

34:31.130 --> 34:33.831
(Grunts)

34:33.866 --> 34:35.600
Anything?

34:37.036 --> 34:39.304
It just disappeared.

34:39.338 --> 34:40.804
(Sighs)

34:42.241 --> 34:43.574
We've lost it.

34:45.678 --> 34:47.911
Both: (Sigh)

34:50.216 --> 34:52.283
(Footsteps crunch)

34:57.382 --> 34:59.224
So Lou landed. She's in Calgary.

34:59.258 --> 35:01.226
Oh, good. That's good.

35:01.260 --> 35:02.660
Where's Katie?

35:02.695 --> 35:05.897
Ah, Katie is sulking in her room.

35:05.931 --> 35:08.600
(Chuckles)

35:08.634 --> 35:10.201
Ah.

35:10.236 --> 35:11.903
It appears as though I've
completely lost my place

35:11.937 --> 35:13.571
in this family.

35:15.040 --> 35:16.774
No.

35:16.809 --> 35:19.344
No, I don't think so. (Chuckles)

35:20.701 --> 35:23.581
But I guess it is tough when
a marriage is breakin' up

35:23.616 --> 35:26.851
and you live kinda far
away from each other.

35:26.885 --> 35:28.253
(Water flows)

35:37.162 --> 35:38.596
You okay?

35:40.299 --> 35:42.800
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm good, I'm...

35:44.203 --> 35:46.137
It's my birthday tomorrow.

35:46.171 --> 35:48.306
I'm startin' to hate birthdays.
(Water flows)

35:48.340 --> 35:49.707
Yeah, tell me about it.

35:49.742 --> 35:52.910
I'd rather forget about 'em altogether.

35:52.945 --> 35:54.379
But you're young.

35:54.413 --> 35:55.780
(Chuckles)

35:55.814 --> 35:58.116
I'm as old as I've ever felt.

36:01.587 --> 36:04.422
And as alone as I've ever felt.

36:04.456 --> 36:06.924
Well, then I gotta ask ya

36:06.959 --> 36:09.193
why are you pressurin' Lou so hard

36:09.228 --> 36:12.030
to sign those divorce papers?

36:14.500 --> 36:16.768
I know. She might have mentioned it.

36:18.203 --> 36:19.637
Um...

36:21.073 --> 36:23.675
I don't know. I guess I...

36:23.709 --> 36:27.545
I just feel like if we just get it done,

36:27.579 --> 36:29.814
you know, that...

36:29.848 --> 36:33.851
maybe that door closes
and another one opens.

36:33.886 --> 36:35.553
Or maybe, you now,

36:35.587 --> 36:41.045
once Lou actually physically
sees how final they are...

36:41.894 --> 36:43.361
Reconsider.

36:45.130 --> 36:48.089
Hey, is there something goin'
on between her and Mitch?

36:49.068 --> 36:52.003
I see him around Katie.
She's all over him and I...

36:52.037 --> 36:54.991
Ah, no, Katie's just...

36:55.341 --> 36:58.242
well it's a kid thing - hero worship.

36:58.277 --> 36:59.877
Apparently he saved her pony

36:59.912 --> 37:02.547
from gettin' stuck in the pond, so.

37:02.581 --> 37:03.948
It's nothin'.

37:05.384 --> 37:07.452
Well, if there is somethin' goin' on

37:07.486 --> 37:09.987
between Lou and Mitch,
I don't know about it.

37:10.022 --> 37:12.523
Not that she'd say anything.

37:17.329 --> 37:18.663
(Grimaces)

37:18.697 --> 37:20.331
- Hey, any service?
- No.

37:20.366 --> 37:21.766
(Horse whinnies shrilly)

37:21.800 --> 37:23.134
Me either.

37:27.473 --> 37:28.806
How are you holdin' up?

37:28.841 --> 37:30.208
(Exhales loudly)

37:30.242 --> 37:32.276
I just wish Ty was here.

37:37.216 --> 37:39.350
(Grunts)

37:39.385 --> 37:42.153
You have any more water?

37:42.187 --> 37:44.155
I'm all out.

37:46.325 --> 37:48.159
(Grunts)

37:48.193 --> 37:49.594
(Cub calls out)

37:49.628 --> 37:51.929
Hey! (Cub calls out)

37:51.964 --> 37:53.731
Look at that, man!

37:57.636 --> 37:59.303
(Sighs heavily)

38:00.906 --> 38:02.940
(Distorted sound)

38:14.453 --> 38:17.922
(Horse whinnies shrilly)
(Hooves bang loudly)

38:17.956 --> 38:19.357
Okay, girls...

38:19.391 --> 38:20.758
(Distorted sound)

38:20.793 --> 38:22.860
(Distorted) This is,
this is what we're gonna do.

38:22.895 --> 38:24.629
The um...

38:26.899 --> 38:29.333
(Normal sound resumes) The, uh,
saddles are locked in the trailer.

38:29.368 --> 38:32.703
I'm gonna, I'm gonna take...
I'm gonna take the horse.

38:32.738 --> 38:34.105
(Distorted sound)

38:34.139 --> 38:35.473
Take this horse...

38:36.122 --> 38:38.309
And we're gonna...

38:38.343 --> 38:40.278
I'm gonna ride up to where...

38:40.312 --> 38:41.746
the ranch where you had the clinic.

38:41.780 --> 38:43.214
Dad, that's miles away. (Horse bangs)

38:43.248 --> 38:45.082
If I get a cell signal before then

38:45.117 --> 38:47.552
I'll, I'll call for help and...

38:49.488 --> 38:51.823
and everything will be fine.
(Horse whinnies and bangs)

38:51.857 --> 38:54.192
Just stay off the road, okay,

38:54.226 --> 38:56.861
because somebody's gonna come barrelin'
around that corner.

38:56.895 --> 39:00.331
I gotta do...
haven't ridden bareback in a long time.

39:00.365 --> 39:02.533
Oh! (Spartan snorts)

39:02.568 --> 39:03.901
(Pants)

39:05.337 --> 39:06.737
(Hooves clop)

39:06.772 --> 39:09.340
Just stay away-stay away
from the rock slide please!

39:11.043 --> 39:12.510
(Hooves clop)

39:27.486 --> 39:30.154
(Cub squeals weakly from inside cave)

39:31.991 --> 39:34.259
- Easy, easy.
- Sure.

39:40.933 --> 39:43.568
(Rocks clatter from inside cave)

39:43.602 --> 39:45.403
(Patter of feet) Something moved.

39:45.437 --> 39:46.771
- Bob: There he is!
- Ty: Yeah.

39:46.805 --> 39:49.475
(Cub squeals) Oh my God!

39:53.145 --> 39:54.479
(Cub cries)

39:54.513 --> 39:55.880
Ty: We gotta get him outta there.

39:55.915 --> 39:57.649
Yeah, we do. (Cub cries)

39:59.051 --> 40:00.952
We'll tranq him,
get him back to the camp.

40:00.986 --> 40:03.121
(Bullets click) (Cub cries in pain)

40:03.155 --> 40:04.589
No.

40:04.623 --> 40:06.057
I'm a better shot than you.

40:06.091 --> 40:07.859
We all know I've had a
bit more practice, right?

40:07.893 --> 40:09.759
All right.

40:10.796 --> 40:12.664
(Cub cries)

40:14.066 --> 40:15.433
(Cub cries)

40:20.873 --> 40:23.074
(Hard thwap) (Cub grunts in pain)

40:23.108 --> 40:25.410
Georgie: Whoo, bud.
(Horse snorts quietly)

40:25.444 --> 40:28.631
Easy, you're okay.
Shh... (Horse snorts quietly)

40:29.582 --> 40:30.949
Whoo...

40:32.384 --> 40:33.751
(Gasps in pain) (Horse whinnies softly)

40:33.786 --> 40:35.757
- You're okay.
- Ow.

40:36.589 --> 40:38.289
- Easy.
- (Pants loudly)

40:40.292 --> 40:42.794
- Easy, bud.
- (Pants loudly)

40:44.463 --> 40:46.130
Ah!

40:46.165 --> 40:48.866
(Grimaces in pain, pants)

40:48.901 --> 40:50.368
Are you okay?

40:50.402 --> 40:51.703
(Pants)

40:51.737 --> 40:55.173
Yeah, I just...
I have these really weird cramps.

40:55.207 --> 40:56.574
(Horse snorts and thumps)

40:56.609 --> 40:58.109
Well, you're not...

40:58.143 --> 40:59.811
Is, is the baby okay?

40:59.845 --> 41:01.879
(Exhales loudly) (Horse
snorts and bangs)

41:01.914 --> 41:05.516
They're probably just these
Braxton Hicks contractions.

41:05.551 --> 41:07.793
I've had them before.

41:08.887 --> 41:11.956
So,
you didn't injure yourself when we...

41:13.359 --> 41:15.059
No. (Pants)

41:15.094 --> 41:16.820
I'll be okay.

41:17.564 --> 41:19.230
I'll just... (Pants)

41:19.264 --> 41:20.632
try to walk them off.

41:20.666 --> 41:22.590
See if I can get rid of 'em.

41:23.450 --> 41:26.170
Do you mind stayin' with him?
(Horse whinnies and bangs)

41:26.205 --> 41:27.538
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.

41:27.573 --> 41:28.973
(Pants)

41:29.008 --> 41:30.208
(Horse whinnies and bangs)

41:36.048 --> 41:37.882
(Hooves thud)

41:39.918 --> 41:42.620
(Distorted sound) (Spartan snorts)

41:42.655 --> 41:44.288
Whoa, whoa.

41:46.091 --> 41:48.526
(Distorted sound)

41:51.263 --> 41:52.864
(Hooves thud)

41:54.600 --> 41:56.134
They should be back in range by now.

41:56.168 --> 41:58.202
- What the heck is goin' on?
- I don't know.

41:58.237 --> 41:59.604
I'll try Amy again.

41:59.638 --> 42:01.239
(Door shuts) Hello!

42:01.273 --> 42:02.640
- Hey!
- (Chuckling) Hey!

42:02.675 --> 42:04.609
I'm so glad to be home!

42:04.643 --> 42:06.310
What a nightmare!

42:06.345 --> 42:08.246
Ah, hi.

42:08.280 --> 42:09.747
You would not have believed the mess

42:09.782 --> 42:11.115
at the New York airport.

42:11.150 --> 42:13.551
And Toronto? Even worse.

42:13.585 --> 42:15.753
Straight to voice-mail.

42:15.788 --> 42:17.155
What's going on?

42:20.926 --> 42:22.260
(Horse bangs loudly) Hey, hey, whoa!

42:22.294 --> 42:23.695
Whoa, it's okay.

42:23.729 --> 42:25.096
Once we get you back to Heartland

42:25.130 --> 42:27.131
we'll never coop you up in
a stall again, I promise!

42:27.166 --> 42:29.567
- This is so insane.
- Easy, easy!

42:29.601 --> 42:31.102
What was I thinking? My Dad was right!

42:31.136 --> 42:33.271
I should have, I should have
never have done the clinic!

42:33.305 --> 42:34.839
(Horse whinnies sharply)

42:34.873 --> 42:36.874
Look at this! (Horse bangs loudly)

42:36.909 --> 42:40.311
And that woman!
Why-why did I listen to her?!

42:40.345 --> 42:41.879
We didn't know she was
gonna try to leave us

42:41.914 --> 42:43.281
with her horse!

42:43.315 --> 42:44.682
(Hooves bang loudly)

42:44.717 --> 42:47.085
When has that ever happened to you?
Never!

42:47.119 --> 42:48.619
Well he's my responsibility now

42:48.654 --> 42:50.588
and because of me he's probably hurt!

42:50.622 --> 42:52.123
(Horse whinnies loudly) Listen to him!

42:52.157 --> 42:54.592
(Loud bang) I know! I know.

42:54.626 --> 42:58.029
But there's nothing we can do
about that right now, okay?

42:58.063 --> 42:59.464
(Horse whinnies and bangs)

42:59.498 --> 43:02.300
(Pants)
It could have been a lot worse.

43:02.334 --> 43:04.168
I know. (Pants)

43:05.604 --> 43:07.371
Just... just breathe.

43:08.841 --> 43:10.174
Breathe.

43:11.610 --> 43:13.377
- Okay?
- Okay.

43:13.412 --> 43:15.847
(Horse whinnies in distance)

43:19.218 --> 43:20.685
Spartan.

43:25.624 --> 43:27.258
(Hooves thud)
