Let's go back 2 weeks before I
ruined Christmas.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.017
Don't even think about that
until after breakfast.

01:41.100 --> 01:45.438

to your sister.

01:52.111 --> 01:54.697
You are a good size,
don't get any bigger.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.158
Studies show babies
with larger heads

01:57.242 --> 01:59.327
can grow up to
have higher IQs.

01:59.410 --> 02:00.537

that decision.

02:13.132 --> 02:14.384
I will do it today.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.844
Maybe we should
have penalty points

02:15.927 --> 02:16.886
for not sticking
to the timetable.

02:16.970 --> 02:17.929
Excellent idea.

02:18.012 --> 02:20.014
We can start with

02:27.647 --> 02:28.606
But what if there's a
complication?

02:28.690 --> 02:30.400
Hospitals have
machines and doctors

02:30.483 --> 02:32.735

might need them.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.438
Alright. What did
you do this time?

10:47.521 --> 10:50.316
I threw a paper ball
at Miss Adolf.

Good one.

Apparently I'm supposed to
have something called

a lesson plan.

10:55.279 --> 10:56.405
I mean who knew,
how do you plan music.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.158
-You can't.
-You see that's what I think.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.035
I thought you just kind of
grabbed the guitar,

11:01.118 --> 11:03.913
turn up the volume and
let the Reindeers Rock.

11:04.955 --> 11:08.084
[dramatic rock band music]

11:19.178 --> 11:20.346
Well the music
was so loud,

11:20.429 --> 11:21.389
that the white board just
shattered off the wall.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.682
That sounds awesome!

11:23.766 --> 11:25.351
Yeah. Except Mr. Joy
thought it sounded like

'an orchestra trapped
inside a tumble dryer'.

worse than his bite.

But then, they said that
about my Grandma's dog

11:37.321 --> 11:38.781
and he ate the mailmen.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.631
You covered Miss Adolf
in green gunge?

11:55.714 --> 11:57.550
It was more a
sort of turquoise.

11:57.633 --> 12:00.261
It's not funny, Hank.

12:00.344 --> 12:02.304
Mr. Joy says this is
your final warning.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.556
One more incident and
you'll get suspended.

12:03.639 --> 12:07.226
Hank, you've got to stop
getting into trouble.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.394
It was an accident.

12:08.477 --> 12:11.272
Well it's always an
accident isn't it?

12:18.946 --> 12:20.823
Emily? What are you doing?!

12:20.906 --> 12:22.992
DAD:
I said I'd get the tree

12:23.075 --> 12:25.161
when I'd finished
building the cradle.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.663
Yeah, I thought it would be
nice to have one before Easter.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.248
Emily, you don't
need to be cheeky,

12:29.331 --> 12:30.416
your father's doing his best.

12:30.499 --> 12:33.419
Oh thank you for the
vote of confidence.

12:33.502 --> 12:35.254
So, who wants to
help me decorate it?

12:35.337 --> 12:36.172
Me!

12:36.255 --> 12:38.090
Remember what
happened last time

12:38.174 --> 12:38.507
you decorated the tree?

12:52.271 --> 12:53.189
Sorry!

12:54.231 --> 12:54.607
It was an accident...

12:55.691 --> 12:58.319
Okay, well we can all
decorate the tree.

12:58.402 --> 13:01.197
Come on everybody,
grab a bauble.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.324
Best not, I'll only break it.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.759
HANK: That's odd,
my head feels breezy

13:23.928 --> 13:25.763
Oh that is not good.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.696
CLASS:
No brain. No brain. No brain.

13:42.780 --> 13:46.408
As I always suspected Zipzer -

13:46.492 --> 13:47.576
you're brainless!

13:47.660 --> 13:49.620
[evil cackle]

13:52.706 --> 13:54.500
Don't let me ever
go back to sleep.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.222
Why don't you just
ask Dad to help

14:08.305 --> 14:09.390
and be done with it?

14:09.473 --> 14:10.599
And what?
Be reminded of my failure

14:10.683 --> 14:12.810
every time I put this little
guy down to sleep?

14:14.311 --> 14:15.354
Did he kick?

14:15.437 --> 14:16.689
Yeah. He could kick for
Liverpool!

14:16.772 --> 14:19.191
No Arsenal!

14:22.861 --> 14:25.281
Dad always wanted me
to play football

14:25.364 --> 14:26.907
but I was never any good.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.784
Are you sure about having
a home birth?

14:28.867 --> 14:30.327
Wouldn't you feel more
comfortable in hospital?

14:31.203 --> 14:33.914
I didn't feel comfortable
with Hank

14:33.998 --> 14:34.957
concussing two nurses?

14:35.040 --> 14:38.919
No this time everything's
gonna be perfect.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.713
Nothing is gonna
go wrong.

14:40.796 --> 14:43.882
I can't wait to meet him.

14:43.966 --> 14:44.717
Me too,

14:45.801 --> 14:48.596
I've got a good
feeling about this one.

14:48.679 --> 14:49.930
I think he's gonna
be a genius.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.390
[mum laughs]

14:51.473 --> 14:53.183
Maybe he could help me
put this cradle together.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.643
He's going to do
something amazing.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.438
Just you wait and see.

15:04.361 --> 15:06.113
What they really
mean is -

15:06.196 --> 15:07.823
they hope he doesn't
turn out like me.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.300
Hayden Jason's
gone number one

15:26.383 --> 15:27.551
in the download chart!

15:27.635 --> 15:29.386
Oh! She's spreading
like a virus.

15:30.512 --> 15:31.930
I have to find a cure.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.022
Have you seen
the inspectors?

15:40.105 --> 15:41.398
They were heading for
Mr. Rock's classroom.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.734
One can only hope they've
brought protective headgear.

15:46.904 --> 15:51.075
♪ Just once I want to
hear Santa say... ♪

15:51.158 --> 15:55.788
♪ Go Rudolph, tonight you
can guide the sleigh. ♪

15:58.290 --> 15:59.208
And then the other
reindeers get lost

15:59.291 --> 16:02.169
and Rudolph has
to save the day.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.295
That sounds wonderful.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.421
Wonderful.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.006
You know the beauty
of music lies

16:06.090 --> 16:07.466
in the ear of
the beholder.

16:07.549 --> 16:10.010
And you two have
exquisite ears!

16:10.094 --> 16:11.512
[they laugh]

16:11.595 --> 16:12.388
This is exactly the sort of
imaginative approach

16:12.471 --> 16:13.138
that we're looking for.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.140
I can't wait to see it.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.725
You, you know,
neither can I.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.061
But the musicals
been cancelled.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.772
[laughing]
Cancelled?! Cancelled?!

16:21.855 --> 16:25.567
Mr. Rock's musical is the
highlight of the year!

16:25.651 --> 16:28.278
The staff and pupils
absolutely love it.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.197
It's something that would
never be cancelled.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.490
Ever.

16:31.573 --> 16:34.034
Must have been an admin
error, or something.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.078
You, you know how
wonderful this man is?

16:36.161 --> 16:38.831
He said you all get more money
for costumes this year.

16:38.914 --> 16:39.832
I did?

16:39.915 --> 16:40.874
You did

16:40.958 --> 16:42.710
I did. I did.

16:42.793 --> 16:46.714
And then he went on and
said a new lighting rig.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.006
How generous is that.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.050
That was unexpected but
if that's what it takes

16:50.134 --> 16:53.220
to get this show on the
road, then we must do it.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.388
Oh my goodness.

16:54.471 --> 16:57.266
And then this Headmaster
of Headmasters.

16:57.349 --> 17:02.187
He said the entire orchestra
gets a new instrument

17:02.271 --> 17:05.232
AND a confetti canon
for the finale.

17:05.315 --> 17:06.608
I just get carried away.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.569
It's great to see
a Headmaster

17:08.652 --> 17:09.695
supporting the
creative arts.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.447
And this show is the
perfect opportunity

17:11.530 --> 17:12.114
to see what
Westbrook can do.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.366
Westbrook can do.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.702
With all this new
equipment this better be

17:16.785 --> 17:18.579
the greatest
Christmas musical

17:18.662 --> 17:19.621
the world has ever seen!

17:19.705 --> 17:21.290
Rock on!

17:23.709 --> 17:25.669
Oh rock on.

17:26.670 --> 17:27.838
Hey look! The show's back on!

17:27.921 --> 17:29.798
Awesome!

17:29.882 --> 17:33.135
I think I'm gonna give the
auditions a miss.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.720
C'mon Hankster, you're
amazing on stage.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.472
You have to audition.

Hank Zipzer!

17:43.353 --> 17:44.897
Yeah... maybe...

17:46.231 --> 17:48.067
Yeah, you're totally right!

17:48.150 --> 17:50.235
This could be my
chance to make Mum and Dad

17:50.319 --> 17:51.403
proud of me!

17:53.989 --> 17:56.742
Another day and
still no cradle.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.160
I'll just make a note of that.

Has anyone seen my gherkins?

18:09.171 --> 18:10.339
By the sink.

18:10.422 --> 18:11.715
Enough nonsense
about cradle.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.343
Where are we going to
put the birthing pool?

18:14.426 --> 18:15.677
We're out of gherkins!

18:15.761 --> 18:17.513
It's the vitamin K
your body's craving.

18:17.596 --> 18:18.263
Have some broccoli instead.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.014
I don't want broccoli!

18:19.097 --> 18:22.100
I WANT GHERKINS!

18:22.184 --> 18:24.853
No-one make any
sudden movements.

18:24.937 --> 18:28.148
I can trot to the deli
and get you a jar?

18:28.232 --> 18:29.316
Reindeers do trot, right?

18:29.399 --> 18:30.651
If you would do that,

18:30.734 --> 18:33.320
you would officially
be my favourite child.

18:33.403 --> 18:36.198
I can report you
for saying that.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.493
Go straight to the
deli, no dawdling,

18:39.576 --> 18:42.996
no stopping to, to, to
look at amusing pigeons.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.291
This is an emergency!
Run like the wind!

18:46.375 --> 18:48.043
There only gherkins Dad,
I can do this.

18:48.126 --> 18:50.629
I'm not completely useless.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.968
That was Rudolph, not me!

19:08.981 --> 19:11.233
Sorry son, you'll
have to wait.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.693
Please! It's an emergency!

19:12.776 --> 19:14.820

not an emergency.

it very difficult to...

of course.

It's just I lost your number

34:24.729 --> 34:27.398
in a gherkin related incident.

34:29.567 --> 34:30.735
Okay. I guess you're forgiven.

34:30.818 --> 34:31.819
TAMMY: Hayden get out here -
we got work to do!

34:31.903 --> 34:33.905
Sorry I gotta go, Hank.

34:33.988 --> 34:38.284
Tammy's hollering. Time to go
dress-up doll again.

34:38.367 --> 34:39.494
Can't you get out of it?

34:39.577 --> 34:39.994
Do something fun instead.

34:40.077 --> 34:42.163
I wish.

34:42.246 --> 34:45.082
Say that you've had an idea
for a hit song

34:45.166 --> 34:46.751
Then sneak out when
she's not looking.

34:46.834 --> 34:48.127
That could actually work.

34:48.836 --> 34:50.505
Hank you're a genius.

34:50.588 --> 34:51.756
People don't often
call me that.

34:51.839 --> 34:54.425
If I do escape I'll need
someone to hang out with.

34:54.509 --> 34:57.386
So are you free tonight?

34:59.347 --> 35:03.142
Hello? You still there?

35:03.226 --> 35:04.477
Yeah. Yeah.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.520
I was just erm,
checking my calendar...

35:05.603 --> 35:08.147
I think I might have
a window free.

35:08.231 --> 35:09.982
Great, Okay I'll text you
where to meet.

35:10.066 --> 35:12.777
See you later Rudolph.

35:12.860 --> 35:14.695
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, YES!!!!

35:14.779 --> 35:15.738
No.

35:23.162 --> 35:24.705
You've skated before, right?

35:24.789 --> 35:27.416
No, but how hard can it be?

35:35.466 --> 35:37.552
I don't have to do that
with my arm,

35:37.635 --> 35:40.054
I just think it looks cool.

35:40.137 --> 35:42.265
Don't worry; I got you.

35:42.348 --> 35:43.766
I'm gonna have
a fun time tonight.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.893
I'm not gonna let
anything ruin it.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.277
How's it going in there, hon?

35:56.612 --> 35:58.114
Sugar? You in there?

35:59.490 --> 36:02.243
Will you stop being
so terrified,

36:02.326 --> 36:03.411
this is supposed to be fun.

36:03.494 --> 36:05.163
Have you seen how sharp
these skates are?

36:05.246 --> 36:06.414
Alright look.

36:06.497 --> 36:07.456
Whenever I get nervous
before I go on stage

36:07.540 --> 36:10.376
I just imagine I'm
somewhere else -

36:10.459 --> 36:12.211
like making pancakes
with my mom.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.254
It relaxes me, you should
try it sometime.

36:13.337 --> 36:15.840
Last time I made
pancakes with my mum

36:15.923 --> 36:17.925
I set off every smoke
alarm for about a mile.

36:18.009 --> 36:18.885
You don't like your family?

36:18.968 --> 36:21.304
I love my family,
it's just ...

36:22.722 --> 36:25.516
My sister wants me to be
put in a lab and tested.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.643
My dad wishes I could
score the winning goal

36:27.727 --> 36:29.437
at the world cup and my mum

36:29.520 --> 36:31.522
still basically thinks I'm a
work in progress.

36:31.606 --> 36:32.440
I'm kind of a disappointment.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.568
I'm sure they
love you really.

36:35.651 --> 36:36.777
This Christmas
they're replacing me

36:36.861 --> 36:37.862
with another boy.

36:37.945 --> 36:38.654
No way!

36:38.738 --> 36:40.698
Yeah, my mum's due any day now

36:40.781 --> 36:42.617
and my baby brother's all
they can talk about.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.368
Okay I thought you
were being serious.

36:44.452 --> 36:45.494
I am!

36:45.578 --> 36:48.205
I bet you they call him
"Hank Two Point Oh",

36:48.289 --> 36:49.582
"New and Improved".

36:49.665 --> 36:51.459
Okay then forget about your
home and think about

36:51.542 --> 36:53.336
somewhere else that
makes you happy.

36:55.796 --> 36:56.714
[they laugh]

36:59.008 --> 37:07.350
[more laughter]

37:07.433 --> 37:08.434
Where did you go?

37:08.517 --> 37:11.312
The Spicy Salami,
the family deli.

37:11.395 --> 37:12.313
With my granddad.
It's my favourite place.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.065
Well it worked,
you're skating!

37:15.733 --> 37:18.027
That's amazing!
How did you do that?

37:18.110 --> 37:20.446
[Hayden laughs]

37:21.822 --> 37:22.698
[laughter]

37:29.413 --> 37:30.998
[slow motion: Woooaaahhhh!]

37:31.082 --> 37:32.041
Woah!

37:37.880 --> 37:40.341
Hayden! I am so so sorry!

37:40.424 --> 37:42.510
Are you okay?
Please be okay.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.098
[Hayden laughs]

37:50.434 --> 37:53.354
Skating is SO
not your thing!

37:53.437 --> 37:55.189
Ooh! Help me!
I'm Hank!

37:55.272 --> 37:57.900
And I was really starting
to like you.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.826
Hey, it's Hayden Chase!

38:06.909 --> 38:09.161
[CAMERA CLICKS & CROWD CHATTER]

38:15.751 --> 38:16.502
Those are your fans?!

38:16.585 --> 38:18.921
I thought they'd rip us apart.

38:19.005 --> 38:21.007
Oh it's all part of the job,
I guess.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.633
It was like one of
those wildlife shows

38:22.717 --> 38:24.468
where the hyenas jump on
the cute gazelle

38:25.469 --> 38:26.178
You calling me cute?

38:27.638 --> 38:28.973
[nervous chuckle]

38:29.056 --> 38:30.725
I'll take that
as a yes.

38:36.230 --> 38:38.357
Did you see that?

38:38.441 --> 38:40.526
Please tell
me you saw that.

39:01.005 --> 39:04.383
Did I ever tell you
I grew up on a ranch?

39:04.467 --> 39:09.472
My daddy gave me a
pony for my tenth birthday.

39:09.555 --> 39:13.976
Her coat was so white
I called her Snowflake.

39:14.060 --> 39:17.688
I loved her so much
some nights

39:17.772 --> 39:19.231
I used to sneak down and sleep
in the stable with her.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.111
Then one day
out of the blue...

39:26.197 --> 39:27.865
she bit my hand.

39:29.158 --> 39:31.410
She near took
my finger off.

39:32.369 --> 39:35.581
My daddy said
she'd gone bad,

39:35.664 --> 39:39.251
that we had to send her to
the big ranch in the sky.

39:39.335 --> 39:43.130
I begged him
not to do it....

39:43.214 --> 39:45.925
but in the end,
like he said,

39:46.008 --> 39:47.593
"when they
turn on you,

39:47.676 --> 39:49.720
you gotta show
them who's boss".

39:52.807 --> 39:57.019
Don't you ever
bite me again.

39:57.103 --> 39:58.771
Do I make
myself clear?

40:00.898 --> 40:02.149
Now give me your phone.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.736
We don't want you
running off with that boy.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.531
Zipzer, was it?

40:08.614 --> 40:10.282
Guard this door,
don't let her leave.

40:25.172 --> 40:26.173
Look! There!

40:26.257 --> 40:27.967
That's my arm!

40:28.050 --> 40:28.759
See I was with Hayden.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.761
That could be anyone's arm.

40:30.845 --> 40:31.679
You are losing it. Seriously.

40:31.762 --> 40:34.557
Okay first positions everyone.

40:38.602 --> 40:41.105
You'll never be able to pull
this sleigh on your own Zipzer.

40:41.188 --> 40:42.606
You're too weak.

40:42.690 --> 40:46.110
Okay One house down,
two billion to go.

40:46.193 --> 40:49.738
Rudie can you can pull
this sleigh by yourself?

40:49.822 --> 40:51.031
All aboard Santa!

40:51.115 --> 40:52.825
We've got plenty of
presents to deliver --

40:52.908 --> 40:54.451
all across the world!

40:54.535 --> 40:55.452
Let's go!

40:56.328 --> 40:58.372
I'm in!

41:04.295 --> 41:06.380
[derisive laugh]

41:10.759 --> 41:12.595
Woah!

41:13.220 --> 41:13.345
I'm so sorry.

41:15.472 --> 41:17.308
Oooohhhh OoooHhhhh..!

41:19.268 --> 41:21.687
Oooh... Oooh...

41:21.770 --> 41:24.815
If you have any questions my
door is always open.

41:30.779 --> 41:31.864
...Hoooooooo!

41:33.115 --> 41:35.367
It gives me no pleasure to
tell you I told you so.

41:35.451 --> 41:37.703
Who am I kidding?

41:37.786 --> 41:38.204
I've never been happier.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.835
Ah, now, now will you
call the ambulance,

41:44.919 --> 41:45.252
or shall I?

41:45.336 --> 41:48.756
Ho?

41:48.839 --> 41:51.342
You are despicable,
everything about you.

41:55.179 --> 41:57.765
He fired me from
MY own musical!

41:57.848 --> 41:59.350
What? He can't do that!

41:59.433 --> 42:00.601
What's gonna happen
to the show?

42:00.684 --> 42:02.728
I don't know! And he did!

42:06.148 --> 42:09.777
Lose the sleigh:
much too dangerous.

42:09.860 --> 42:12.529
We're going to try
something different.

42:12.613 --> 42:15.074
Miss Adolf! Anybody
but Miss Adolf!

42:15.157 --> 42:16.492
Silence at the back!

42:16.575 --> 42:19.203
I've got a lot of work to do

42:19.286 --> 42:21.622
knocking this monstrosity
into shape.

42:21.705 --> 42:23.249
This is a masterpiece!

42:23.332 --> 42:25.209
Don't you change one note.

42:25.292 --> 42:26.752
That would be like
painting a m...

42:26.835 --> 42:29.129
a moustache on
the Mona Lisa!

42:29.213 --> 42:31.715
Beethoven's Fifth
is a masterpiece.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.968
The Nutcracker Suite
is a masterpiece.

42:34.051 --> 42:37.263
This is an assault
on Christmas.

42:37.346 --> 42:39.431
I'm begging you,
don't ruin it!

42:39.515 --> 42:41.934
I'm going to rescue it.

42:42.017 --> 42:47.564
That would be like the
iceberg rescuing the Titanic.

42:47.648 --> 42:51.777
Toodle oooh Mr. Clause.

42:56.657 --> 42:59.868
You can't give up!
This is your show!

42:59.952 --> 43:02.246
Hank sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose.

43:02.329 --> 43:03.998
Sometimes you play
Glastonbury,

43:04.081 --> 43:06.000
sometimes you get stuck
in the portaloo

43:06.083 --> 43:07.793
and you never make it
to the stage.

43:07.876 --> 43:09.837
Oh yes! That happened.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.047
What if I say I won't do it?

43:12.131 --> 43:12.965
They can't put it on
without Rudolph?

43:13.048 --> 43:15.968
This is your
moment to shine.

43:16.051 --> 43:18.095
I need you to make
that show fabulous!

43:18.178 --> 43:19.513
I will. By getting you
your musical back.

43:19.596 --> 43:21.932
Wait!

43:22.016 --> 43:24.560
Wait! No! No! Hank!

43:24.643 --> 43:28.480
Oh I have to work on this
teacher/pupil obedience thing.

43:30.774 --> 43:31.442
Oh!

43:32.860 --> 43:33.986
Why?

43:37.156 --> 43:38.157
Hello?

43:38.240 --> 43:41.035
Oh erm, yes, yes,
there's a lot of dust.

43:41.118 --> 43:42.119
I'm just checking.

43:43.662 --> 43:44.705
Dust.

43:44.788 --> 43:45.664
I know how to impress
the inspectors.

43:45.748 --> 43:47.833
You're moving to
a new school?!

43:47.916 --> 43:49.543
No. But I can get
Hayden Chase

43:49.626 --> 43:51.879
to sing in the
Christmas Show.

43:51.962 --> 43:52.755
Oh and I can
get the Queen

43:52.838 --> 43:54.882
to tap dance
with penguins.

43:54.965 --> 43:56.550
You can?!

43:59.011 --> 44:00.471
Oh. But I really CAN get
Hayden Chase - she's my friend!

44:00.554 --> 44:01.555
Ridiculous! What are you? Six?

44:01.638 --> 44:04.516
You're nothing. No-one.

44:04.600 --> 44:08.771
Stars like Hayden Chase
don't even know you exist.

44:08.854 --> 44:10.105
Lucky for them!

44:10.189 --> 44:13.233
Now get out of my sight before
I give you detention -

44:13.317 --> 44:14.318
for a whole year!

44:14.401 --> 44:16.028
If I can get Hayden to do it,

44:16.111 --> 44:18.280
will you put Mr. Rock back in
charge of the show?

44:18.364 --> 44:19.823
Oh I'll do one
better.

44:19.907 --> 44:21.825
If Hayden Chase sings
in our musical -

44:21.909 --> 44:23.535
I'll eat my socks in front
of the whole school.

44:23.619 --> 44:25.579
You heard it here first!

44:28.874 --> 44:30.793
Out with the new
and in with the old.

44:30.876 --> 44:33.295
You can't go wrong
with a classic.

44:33.379 --> 44:34.755
But the show's on Saturday!

44:34.838 --> 44:36.799
I've got an IQ of a
hundred and forty six

44:36.882 --> 44:38.717
and even I couldn't
rehearse a whole new play

44:38.801 --> 44:39.927
in two days!

44:40.010 --> 44:42.930
Where there's a will
there's a way Emily.

44:43.013 --> 44:44.264
Now let's show the inspectors

44:44.348 --> 44:46.433
what Westbrook really stands
for.

44:46.517 --> 44:47.851
Indecisiveness?

44:49.061 --> 44:52.314
Tradition. Ohh...

44:53.899 --> 44:55.651
Hi Hayden,
it's me Hank.

44:55.734 --> 44:56.902
Again.

44:56.985 --> 44:58.445
Are you getting any of
these messages?

44:58.529 --> 45:00.114
I really need
you to call me back,

45:00.197 --> 45:01.240
it's kind of urgent.

45:01.323 --> 45:02.741
I've got a massive
favour to ask.

45:02.825 --> 45:04.284
Dude, this isn't funny
anymore.

45:04.368 --> 45:06.286
You know it actually wasn't
that funny to begin with.

45:06.370 --> 45:07.788
Why isn't she calling me back?

45:07.871 --> 45:09.623
Maybe her phone's broken?

45:09.706 --> 45:12.042
Maybe you need to
leave planet Hank

45:12.126 --> 45:13.877
and join the rest of
us back on Earth.

45:13.961 --> 45:14.962
I know! I'll go to the hotel

45:15.045 --> 45:16.380
and ask her face to face.

45:16.463 --> 45:17.464
Hank! Getting into
more trouble

45:17.548 --> 45:18.966
isn't going to help
Mr. Rock or you.

45:19.049 --> 45:20.092
You're wasting your
time anyway.

45:20.175 --> 45:21.969
She's singing in City
Square tonight.

45:22.052 --> 45:25.055
Tell Mum and Dad
I'm rehearsing late!

45:25.139 --> 45:26.223
"She's singing in City
Square tonight."

45:26.306 --> 45:27.975
Why didn't you just
call him a cab?

45:28.058 --> 45:29.810
I don't sounds like
that, just so you know.

45:29.893 --> 45:30.978
Come on, big mouth.

45:31.061 --> 45:32.730
We need to find someone to
stop him.

45:34.398 --> 45:35.524
Wait a minute.

45:35.607 --> 45:36.650
This is like looking for a
snowball in a blizzard!

Right now! This is your
last warning!

59:31.651 --> 59:38.783
[chanting continues]

59:38.866 --> 59:42.078
Very well, we'll do the
show without them.

59:43.288 --> 59:45.623
But Nick can't play all
sixteen parts by himself.

59:45.707 --> 59:47.583
I am very versatile.

59:47.667 --> 59:49.335
You're really not.

59:49.419 --> 59:52.171
Please, Miss. Go outside
and talk to them.

59:52.255 --> 59:55.258
I refuse to negotiate
with anarchists.

59:55.341 --> 59:58.052
Okay let's take
it from the top.

1:00:00.096 --> 1:00:02.849
[customers shout & chatter]

1:00:02.932 --> 1:00:04.475
Uno alla volta! One at a time!

1:00:04.559 --> 1:00:08.855
Don't make me use
the squirty cream.

1:00:10.773 --> 1:00:13.276
Hank! My hero!

1:00:13.359 --> 1:00:16.654
Clear those plates and
wash up, will you?

1:00:16.738 --> 1:00:19.615
At least Papa Pete's
still pleased to see me.

1:00:19.699 --> 1:00:21.826
Hands off!

1:00:21.909 --> 1:00:25.621
My last panettone
is for Mrs Trapani.

1:00:27.248 --> 1:00:30.710
Save yourself while
you still can, Mrs Trapani!

1:00:32.754 --> 1:00:33.963
Buon Natale.

1:00:34.756 --> 1:00:36.799
Do you know a Hank Zipzer?

1:00:40.094 --> 1:00:41.637
Hi.

1:00:43.973 --> 1:00:47.518
Hayden! I, I don't...
what are you...

1:00:47.602 --> 1:00:50.355
it's so good to see you!

1:00:50.438 --> 1:00:52.315
I just really wanted
to apologise

1:00:52.398 --> 1:00:54.025
for the whole
'stalker' thing.

1:00:54.108 --> 1:00:55.318
Tammy was way out of line.

1:00:55.401 --> 1:00:56.527
How did you find me?

1:00:56.611 --> 1:00:58.905
You told me this was your
happy place, remember?

1:00:58.988 --> 1:01:01.032
So what were you doing
crawling under the stage?

1:01:01.115 --> 1:01:03.534
I err, needed to
ask you something

1:01:03.618 --> 1:01:04.994
but it doesn't matter now.

1:01:05.078 --> 1:01:06.371
What? Tell me.

1:01:06.454 --> 1:01:08.539
I messed up, that's what I do.

1:01:08.623 --> 1:01:12.377
I mess up people's lives
and make them worse.

1:01:12.460 --> 1:01:13.461
It's the one thing
I'm really good at.

1:01:13.544 --> 1:01:15.963
That and rocking an apron.

1:01:17.507 --> 1:01:19.342
Here let me help you
with the dishes.

1:01:19.425 --> 1:01:21.094
You've got much better
things to be doing

1:01:21.177 --> 1:01:23.096
than washing up
here with me.

1:01:23.179 --> 1:01:25.223
No. I don't.

1:01:25.306 --> 1:01:27.183
You know I really like
hanging out with you Hank.

1:01:27.266 --> 1:01:28.768
You're the only person I know

1:01:28.851 --> 1:01:30.061
that doesn't want
anything from me.

1:01:30.144 --> 1:01:32.855
Tammy will be furious if she
finds out you're here.

1:01:32.939 --> 1:01:36.025
I just realised
Tammy's always mad.

1:01:36.109 --> 1:01:38.277
Now I'm gonna choose who
my friends are, not her.

1:01:38.361 --> 1:01:40.947
I choose you.

1:01:42.990 --> 1:01:46.035
I am the ghost of
Jacob Marley.

1:01:46.119 --> 1:01:47.328
It cannot be!

1:01:47.412 --> 1:01:49.747
You died seven years ago
this Christmas Eve.

1:01:49.831 --> 1:01:54.627
Woah. You will be
visited by three ghosts.

1:01:54.710 --> 1:01:56.629
I can't do this,
it's impossible.

1:01:56.712 --> 1:01:58.631
Impossible is winning
the Eighty Eight

1:01:58.714 --> 1:02:01.926
Fencing World Championships

1:02:02.009 --> 1:02:04.470
with a broken epe
and chronic diarrhea.

1:02:04.554 --> 1:02:06.222
Then you do it.

1:02:11.310 --> 1:02:13.563
Children today
have no backbone.

1:02:15.940 --> 1:02:16.899
Pathetic!

1:02:35.084 --> 1:02:37.295
Don't even think
about asking.

1:02:37.378 --> 1:02:38.546
Oh. Very well, then I SHALL
play all the parts.

1:02:40.756 --> 1:02:44.010
At least with my
performance Dickens' words

1:02:44.093 --> 1:02:49.140
will be en-un-ci- ate-ed
with per-fect cla-ri-ty.

1:02:54.687 --> 1:02:57.815
A little something for you,

1:02:57.899 --> 1:02:59.859
you two saved my life!

1:02:59.942 --> 1:03:02.945
Papa Pete makes the
best pasta in London.

1:03:04.197 --> 1:03:06.073

My grandson says
the nicest things.

1:03:08.284 --> 1:03:09.827
Oh wow. This is amazing.

1:03:09.911 --> 1:03:13.372
And he has excellent
choice in friends.

1:03:14.916 --> 1:03:17.418
Hayden! Hayden Chase!

What a result!

1:03:58.000 --> 1:03:58.793
You came through!

1:03:58.876 --> 1:04:03.172
Hank? What was
he talking about?

1:04:03.256 --> 1:04:06.551
I was trying to help
my music teacher Mr. Rock.

1:04:06.634 --> 1:04:09.095
I thought if you could sing
in the show then...

1:04:09.178 --> 1:04:10.137
So that's what all this
has been about?

1:04:10.221 --> 1:04:12.557
You just wanted
something from me?

1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:14.225
No, no it's, it's
not like that.

1:04:14.308 --> 1:04:15.351
You know, I thought
you were different

1:04:15.434 --> 1:04:17.436
and now you're just like
all the others.

1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:18.437
Please, let me explain.

1:04:18.521 --> 1:04:21.107
No don't, Okay I've
heard it before.

1:04:21.190 --> 1:04:23.234
Goodbye Hank.

1:04:29.073 --> 1:04:32.076
She doesn't like my pasta?

1:04:32.159 --> 1:04:33.536
She doesn't like me.

CHANTING:
I want Rock! I want Rock!

1:04:43.170 --> 1:04:46.007
I feel so bad about
not believing Hank.

1:04:46.090 --> 1:04:47.758
I feel bad we don't
have a show

1:04:47.842 --> 1:04:48.718
for Hayden to sing in.

1:04:48.801 --> 1:04:50.261
And for Hank, obviously.

1:04:50.344 --> 1:04:51.345
Well, it's not over yet.

How did that get
in my head?!

She's a witch.

1:05:03.149 --> 1:05:04.442

She is going to be right here.

1:05:16.162 --> 1:05:18.664
How's that for an early
Christmas present.

1:05:24.754 --> 1:05:26.505
I told you we should
have believed Hank.

1:05:26.589 --> 1:05:28.132
Really?

1:05:28.215 --> 1:05:30.843
I must have missed that piece
of parenting brilliance.

1:05:30.926 --> 1:05:34.347
Oh ok, well I THOUGHT it.

1:05:34.430 --> 1:05:36.182
If that Tammy knew
they were friends,

1:05:36.265 --> 1:05:38.017
why would she call him
a stalker?

1:05:38.100 --> 1:05:39.518
Cause she didn't
think that Hank

1:05:39.602 --> 1:05:42.688
was good enough for
her precious star.

1:05:42.772 --> 1:05:45.316
I tell you if I ever see that
massive-haired madam

1:05:45.399 --> 1:05:46.400
I'm gonna...

1:05:46.484 --> 1:05:49.528
Go into early labour
so calm down.

1:05:49.612 --> 1:05:53.366
Keep breathing,
in, out, in,

1:05:55.284 --> 1:05:57.453
out, big breaths.

1:05:58.788 --> 1:06:00.289
This won't take a minute.

1:06:02.625 --> 1:06:04.877

make no sense.

got no cradle!

So, so were are we
gonna put the baby?!

He can't live in
here forever!

1:06:13.719 --> 1:06:17.056
Oh, I will buy
you another one.

1:06:17.139 --> 1:06:18.432

ghosts.

No!

No. No.

Present.

Argh!

Productions Yet to Come.

Who am I?

I am a soul of the night,
while I travel...

1:07:10.943 --> 1:07:12.862
Just take a look, at what the
audience thinks

1:07:12.945 --> 1:07:16.949
of what you've done.

1:07:17.032 --> 1:07:20.786
Not exactly laughing in the
aisles, are they?

1:07:20.870 --> 1:07:22.204
You know what they're
all thinking?

1:07:22.288 --> 1:07:23.539
They love Dickens?

1:07:23.622 --> 1:07:26.500
How quickly will this be over?

1:07:26.584 --> 1:07:30.546
Don't be a Scrooge,
Miss Adolf.

1:07:31.714 --> 1:07:36.177
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me!

1:07:42.141 --> 1:07:45.644
Are you alright Miss Adolf?

1:07:45.728 --> 1:07:48.814
No! I need to find Mr. Rock!

1:07:48.898 --> 1:07:51.358
I have to save Christmas!

If I was a washed up
old music teacher,

1:07:53.068 --> 1:07:55.946
where would I go...?

Do you want me to help you
fill it with water's

1:07:58.240 --> 1:07:59.283
No, it's fine.

1:07:59.366 --> 1:08:00.618
Alright.

1:08:00.701 --> 1:08:02.661
I mean I would be the one
filling it, you know?

1:08:02.745 --> 1:08:05.247
Knowing me I'd probably flood
the flat or something.

1:08:05.331 --> 1:08:07.458
I mean I'd just, just
stand over here and watch.

1:08:07.541 --> 1:08:10.085
No you can fill it
when the time comes.

1:08:10.169 --> 1:08:11.086

believe you about Hayden.

now anyway.

1:09:42.970 --> 1:09:45.431
I need you! Alright?

1:09:45.514 --> 1:09:47.600
Almost got it,
a little louder.

1:09:47.683 --> 1:09:48.100
I SAID I NEED YOU.

1:09:49.935 --> 1:09:52.062
NOT THE PRODUCTION.
NOT THE SCHOOL.

1:09:52.146 --> 1:09:54.940
ME! I NEED YOU.

1:09:55.024 --> 1:09:57.526
Well why didn't you say so!
Course I'll help!

1:09:57.610 --> 1:09:58.319
Where are you going?

1:09:58.402 --> 1:10:00.779
I'm in the middle of a gig,

1:10:00.863 --> 1:10:02.239
I can't just walk away.

1:10:02.323 --> 1:10:04.491
I could use a little help.

1:10:04.575 --> 1:10:05.659
Oh no.

1:10:05.743 --> 1:10:10.206
Y.E.S. Pick it up.
Come on.

1:10:12.666 --> 1:10:13.959
Hit against your thighs.

1:10:14.043 --> 1:10:15.419
Go on.

1:10:21.342 --> 1:10:25.346
I tell you something
dancing, would be great...

1:10:25.429 --> 1:10:27.681
You'll make a lot of
money dancing.

1:10:27.765 --> 1:10:28.641
You are an insufferable
little man

1:10:28.724 --> 1:10:31.602
and I curse the
day we ever met.

1:10:37.900 --> 1:10:38.567
We shouldn't be here Mum.

1:10:38.651 --> 1:10:40.486
You need to talk to her

1:10:40.569 --> 1:10:41.820
before she flies out tonight.

1:10:41.904 --> 1:10:42.947
I really don't.

1:10:43.030 --> 1:10:43.989
Please can we just go?

1:10:44.073 --> 1:10:45.199
Listen, if you don't tell
her how you feel,

1:10:45.282 --> 1:10:47.493
you'll regret it.

1:10:47.576 --> 1:10:48.535
I'm starting to regret being
here with you.

1:10:48.619 --> 1:10:52.581
Oh sorry, I just had
to do that.

1:10:52.665 --> 1:10:56.585
Ow... Erm no. I think it's
started it.

1:10:56.669 --> 1:10:58.629
I'll have to sit down!

1:11:02.675 --> 1:11:04.385
Shouldn't Rudolph
have bigger antlers?

1:11:04.468 --> 1:11:06.178
I am the star of the show.

1:11:06.261 --> 1:11:08.639
What do you think?

1:11:08.722 --> 1:11:10.516
Your show, your decision.

1:11:10.599 --> 1:11:12.309
We're gonna stay
with your antlers.

1:11:12.393 --> 1:11:14.687
You know what I'm thinking?

1:11:14.770 --> 1:11:17.064
I'm thinking we should go
much bigger antlers.

1:11:19.149 --> 1:11:22.695
Remember when
you first come out

1:11:22.778 --> 1:11:27.491
the other reindeers have
no respect for you.

1:11:27.574 --> 1:11:31.954
So be tentative, nervous.

1:11:33.288 --> 1:11:37.209
[gasps & whimpers]

1:11:40.295 --> 1:11:43.173
You must feel what
Rudolph feels.

1:11:43.257 --> 1:11:48.262
You must BECOME
a reindeer.

1:11:48.345 --> 1:11:52.391
Ok, from the top!

1:12:08.782 --> 1:12:10.284
HAYDEN: Hi Mom, sorry I'm not
gonna be home for Christmas.

1:12:10.367 --> 1:12:12.369
I'll call you from Tokyo.

1:12:12.453 --> 1:12:16.081
She does spell
Christmas wrong like me...

1:12:16.582 --> 1:12:17.791
Oh a muffin.

1:12:22.087 --> 1:12:23.756
I'm not gonna sing in
your school show

1:12:23.839 --> 1:12:24.923
so you might as well leave.

1:12:25.007 --> 1:12:27.551
I don't care about the show,
I care about...

1:12:27.634 --> 1:12:28.427
What you think of me.

1:12:28.510 --> 1:12:30.929
That's private.

1:12:31.930 --> 1:12:33.557
You've got dyslexia
like me.

1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:35.100
You should probably go,

1:12:35.184 --> 1:12:36.268
though your the one with
the problem not me.

1:12:36.351 --> 1:12:40.898
I get it, you're a
big pop star.

1:12:40.981 --> 1:12:43.776
You don't want it to damage
your perfect image.

1:12:43.859 --> 1:12:46.195
I never said I was perfect.

1:12:46.278 --> 1:12:50.449
Deep down just as messed
up as my spelling.

1:12:50.532 --> 1:12:53.744
I didn't tell you
about the show

1:12:53.827 --> 1:12:56.580
because I didn't want
to be another person

1:12:56.663 --> 1:12:59.792
asking you for something.

1:12:59.875 --> 1:13:01.043
You weren't using me?

1:13:01.126 --> 1:13:03.337
Only to help with
the washing up.

1:13:04.922 --> 1:13:06.715
I'm sorry Hank.

1:13:06.799 --> 1:13:09.468
Oh no, your granddad must
think I'm really rude.

1:13:09.551 --> 1:13:10.719
I didn't eat his pasta.

1:13:10.803 --> 1:13:11.762
He's a mess.

1:13:11.845 --> 1:13:13.931
The only way to
make it up to him is

1:13:14.014 --> 1:13:16.141
to come back with me.

1:13:16.225 --> 1:13:18.977
I wish I could but we're
flying out tonight.

1:13:19.061 --> 1:13:20.979
Well you don't have too,
if you don't want to.

1:13:21.063 --> 1:13:22.231
Try telling Tammy that.

1:13:22.314 --> 1:13:24.483
Well maybe it's time you
just stood up to Tammy?

1:13:24.566 --> 1:13:27.111
And maybe it's time you
stopped sticking your snout

1:13:27.194 --> 1:13:29.154
where it's not wanted.

1:13:29.238 --> 1:13:30.781
Get this loser out of here!

1:13:34.326 --> 1:13:35.869
Get moving honey,
you are on in five.

1:13:35.953 --> 1:13:37.162
Hank!

1:13:37.246 --> 1:13:38.372
Hayden!

1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:44.711
Aww. Ooo.

1:13:47.131 --> 1:13:49.258
Get your hands off my son!

1:13:49.341 --> 1:13:52.845
You were faking?!
Who even does that?

1:13:52.928 --> 1:13:54.429
I told you to keep him
away from my star.

1:13:54.513 --> 1:13:56.306
She's worth a lot of
money to me and

1:13:56.390 --> 1:13:58.892
I won't see her
sidetracked by a loser

1:13:58.976 --> 1:14:00.519
like him!

1:14:00.602 --> 1:14:02.688
The only loser
around here is you.

1:14:02.771 --> 1:14:03.522
Lying about my son
being a stalker!

1:14:03.605 --> 1:14:07.234
You knew they were friends!

1:14:07.317 --> 1:14:08.402
I don't have to listen
to this trailer trash -

1:14:08.485 --> 1:14:11.864
throw her out along
with her dumb kid.

1:14:11.947 --> 1:14:12.865
Oh trailer trash?!

1:14:12.948 --> 1:14:15.284
I'll show you
trailer trash!

1:14:15.367 --> 1:14:16.577
[grunting & fighting]

1:14:18.245 --> 1:14:19.454
Don't just stand there!
Do something!

1:14:19.538 --> 1:14:21.456
I'm not fighting
a pregnant lady!

1:14:21.540 --> 1:14:23.458
Agh!

1:14:30.591 --> 1:14:35.179
[Tammy screams]

1:14:51.236 --> 1:14:52.571
You're fired!

1:14:52.654 --> 1:14:54.323
Fired, fired, fired, fired,

1:14:54.406 --> 1:14:55.365
fired, fired, FIRED!

1:14:58.243 --> 1:15:01.163

1:15:04.666 --> 1:15:06.627
[she groans again]

1:15:06.710 --> 1:15:07.628
It's okay Mum, you can
stop pretending now.

1:15:07.711 --> 1:15:10.172
No I'm, I'm not
pretending!

1:15:10.255 --> 1:15:12.424
Oh the baby really
is coming!

1:15:12.507 --> 1:15:14.635
I'll call Dad!

1:15:18.805 --> 1:15:19.932
Lift. Lift. Lift.

1:15:20.015 --> 1:15:21.058
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1:15:21.141 --> 1:15:22.100
Oh. No. No. No.

1:15:22.184 --> 1:15:23.143
Argh!

1:15:23.227 --> 1:15:24.728
I told you it was too big.

1:15:24.811 --> 1:15:25.562
Oh shut up.

1:15:25.646 --> 1:15:29.316
[phone rings]

1:15:33.487 --> 1:15:34.446
Oh.

1:15:34.529 --> 1:15:38.367
You couldn't answer
that could yer?

1:15:38.450 --> 1:15:39.701
It's going to voicemail!

1:15:39.785 --> 1:15:40.786
I've gotta get home!

1:15:40.869 --> 1:15:41.912
I'll call Emily!

1:15:41.995 --> 1:15:43.205
No. No. No. She'll
just boss me about.

1:15:43.288 --> 1:15:45.457
It's, it's you Hank.
You're my birth partner now!

1:15:45.540 --> 1:15:47.751
Mum. You don't want me.

1:15:47.834 --> 1:15:49.211
I'll mess up! Something
bad will happen.

1:15:49.294 --> 1:15:50.963
It always does. I'll get help!

1:15:51.046 --> 1:15:53.298
Argh! the baby's coming! oh!

1:15:56.885 --> 1:15:58.053
Stop!

1:16:03.016 --> 1:16:04.434
Bethlehem's a
bit far love,

1:16:04.518 --> 1:16:06.103
but I can drop you
at St. Thomas's?

1:16:06.186 --> 1:16:07.229
It's just over the river.

1:16:07.312 --> 1:16:08.772
No. No. I need
to get home.

1:16:08.855 --> 1:16:10.107
I'm having a home birth.

1:16:10.190 --> 1:16:12.234
It's. It's all going to
be perfect this time.

1:16:12.317 --> 1:16:13.443
We won't make it, Mum.
It's too far!

1:16:13.527 --> 1:16:14.528
Take us to the hospital.

1:16:19.157 --> 1:16:21.827
No. No. You need to lift
your end higher.

1:16:21.910 --> 1:16:24.121
You need to lower your
end and twist.

1:16:24.204 --> 1:16:26.790
It won't twist! Lift!

1:16:26.873 --> 1:16:28.834
I said don't choose
a big one?

1:16:28.917 --> 1:16:29.960
What did he do?

1:16:30.043 --> 1:16:31.503
You said this cradle
was fit for a king!

1:16:31.586 --> 1:16:36.049
Yes. But you don't
live in a castle!

1:16:36.133 --> 1:16:39.886
[message chime]

1:16:39.970 --> 1:16:44.016

Rosa's having the baby!!!

1:16:47.144 --> 1:16:49.229
I've gotta get out.
Let me out!

1:16:50.188 --> 1:16:51.815
Oh. What about the cradle?!

1:16:51.898 --> 1:16:52.482
It looks good there.

1:16:57.446 --> 1:16:59.906
Dad's on his way.
He won't be long!

1:16:59.990 --> 1:17:02.826
I don't wanna be here!
I wanna be at home!

1:17:04.328 --> 1:17:05.829
You'll be better off
without me.

1:17:05.912 --> 1:17:07.039
I'm a total failure.

1:17:07.122 --> 1:17:08.332
Don't say that.

1:17:09.416 --> 1:17:09.499
Don't ever say that.

1:17:11.626 --> 1:17:14.463
You know what's
important is not,

1:17:14.546 --> 1:17:15.547
good grades and
all that stuff.

1:17:15.630 --> 1:17:17.507
What is important
is that you have

1:17:17.591 --> 1:17:23.055
a good heart and
you've got a great heart.

Did he just lose his voice?

1:17:52.417 --> 1:17:53.502
I thought so.

1:17:53.585 --> 1:17:55.170
My Rudolph has
lost his voice.

You're exactly right,

be a disaster.

Now is not the time
for a nap Hank.

It's a trick that
Hayden taught me.

1:18:31.373 --> 1:18:33.041
You close your eyes
and imagine that

1:18:33.125 --> 1:18:34.960
you're in a place that
makes you happy.

1:18:35.043 --> 1:18:38.505

1:20:07.594 --> 1:20:10.055
Bella bambino!

1:20:11.264 --> 1:20:15.060
Oh he is beautiful love!

1:20:15.143 --> 1:20:17.813
I am so sorry I
wasn't with you.

1:20:17.896 --> 1:20:23.068
Well you were,
thanks to Hank.

1:20:23.151 --> 1:20:25.028
I'm so glad
you're here.

1:20:25.111 --> 1:20:28.406
But we do need to talk
about the importance

1:20:28.490 --> 1:20:31.243
of sticking to timetables.

1:20:31.326 --> 1:20:33.411
Hey. If you hurry you
can still make it

1:20:33.495 --> 1:20:34.371
back to school
before curtain up.

1:20:34.454 --> 1:20:35.872
I'm not in the
show anymore.

1:20:35.956 --> 1:20:38.124
Well you are now!

1:20:43.505 --> 1:20:45.215
We're just heading
for the airport now.

1:20:45.298 --> 1:20:47.050
Well soon as we're
wheels down in Tokyo

1:20:47.133 --> 1:20:49.094
let's talk turkey on those
extra dates in Sydney.

1:20:49.177 --> 1:20:51.221
I want top dollar, Brett.

1:20:51.304 --> 1:20:53.598
Okay. Don't you
lowball me.

1:20:53.682 --> 1:20:55.016
Come on darlin'
let's hustle,

1:20:55.100 --> 1:20:56.309
we got a plane to catch.

1:20:58.645 --> 1:20:59.729
I said c'mon. Like now!

1:21:11.074 --> 1:21:12.242
What do you mean,
Hayden Chase isn't coming?!

1:21:12.325 --> 1:21:15.412
She had no choice.
She had to go to Japan.

1:21:15.495 --> 1:21:17.330
Man, it would've been
great to sing with her.

1:21:17.414 --> 1:21:18.540
And get a selfie.

1:21:18.999 --> 1:21:21.042
What?

1:21:21.126 --> 1:21:23.461
I have five thousand
of these printed!

1:21:23.545 --> 1:21:26.381
The audience are expecting
Hayden Chase!

1:21:26.464 --> 1:21:27.465
The inspectors
have arrived,

1:21:27.549 --> 1:21:29.134
I've shown them
to their seats.

1:21:31.177 --> 1:21:33.513
They can't see this!
I'll lose my job!

1:21:33.597 --> 1:21:36.641
We must empty
the hall, but how?

1:21:36.725 --> 1:21:40.103
What if we had
a sudden fire?

1:21:40.186 --> 1:21:43.481
Oh no you don't.
The show must go on.

1:21:43.565 --> 1:21:45.400
Never admit defeat.

1:21:50.572 --> 1:21:51.865
Right! The show must go on.

1:21:56.578 --> 1:21:58.997
How about here? Can you
see the stage okay?

1:22:00.707 --> 1:22:02.500
Err, the cravings
are supposed to stop

1:22:02.584 --> 1:22:05.045
after the baby's
born you know...

1:22:05.128 --> 1:22:07.255
Just shush and zoom
in on the stage.

1:22:07.339 --> 1:22:10.342
[applause]

1:22:10.425 --> 1:22:13.470
Welcome to
Westbrook Academy!

1:22:13.553 --> 1:22:15.013
We are delighted to
have you here with us

1:22:15.096 --> 1:22:18.683
within these hallowed
halls of learning.

1:22:18.767 --> 1:22:21.102
Where education
is the name

1:22:21.186 --> 1:22:22.938
and excellence
is the game!

1:22:23.021 --> 1:22:27.651
Christmas is a time
for, for love,

1:22:27.734 --> 1:22:28.985
peace and understanding,

1:22:29.069 --> 1:22:32.822
definitely NOT a time for
throwing things at headmasters.

1:22:32.906 --> 1:22:36.368
On an unrelated
matter Hayden Chase

1:22:36.451 --> 1:22:37.702
will not be
appearing tonight.

1:22:37.786 --> 1:22:39.746
[crowd boos]

1:22:40.622 --> 1:22:42.666
In another tiny
cast change,

1:22:42.749 --> 1:22:45.210
our hugely talented lead,
Nick McKelty,

1:22:45.293 --> 1:22:47.796
has lost his voice and
will be replaced

1:22:47.879 --> 1:22:52.175
by the marginally
talented Hank Zipzer.

1:22:52.258 --> 1:22:55.011
CROWD: STALKER!
STALKER! STALKER!

1:22:56.304 --> 1:22:58.807
Hank and Hayden are friends!

1:22:58.890 --> 1:23:01.726
She's eaten at my deli!

1:23:01.810 --> 1:23:04.771
The Spicy Salami!
It's very good.

1:23:04.854 --> 1:23:07.190
Two for One
lunch deals.

1:23:07.273 --> 1:23:08.817
[crowd jeers]

1:23:08.900 --> 1:23:10.735
So without further ado,

1:23:10.819 --> 1:23:14.739
sit back and endure -
enjoy -

1:23:14.823 --> 1:23:18.410
the very first, and possibly
the very last performance

1:23:18.493 --> 1:23:21.746
of 'Rudolph the
Rock 'n' Roll Reindeer.'

1:23:21.830 --> 1:23:24.165
Be aware: no
refunds will be admitted.

1:23:24.249 --> 1:23:26.251
[crowd jeers]

1:23:26.334 --> 1:23:27.085
No throwing things...

1:23:27.168 --> 1:23:29.963
No... I am the headmaster...

1:23:40.515 --> 1:23:42.517
Good luck Rudolph.

1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:43.101
You can do this.

1:23:43.184 --> 1:23:45.645
No I can't.

1:23:46.563 --> 1:23:48.648
Hold it,

1:23:48.732 --> 1:23:52.694
kids, you know I
don't care that much

1:23:52.777 --> 1:23:54.571
about my musical but
what I care about

1:23:54.654 --> 1:23:56.614
is that your willing to
walkout because of

1:23:56.698 --> 1:23:58.116
those people out there.

1:23:58.199 --> 1:24:00.785
You're Hank Zipzer right.

1:24:00.869 --> 1:24:02.787
You're made of
stronger stuff right.

1:24:02.871 --> 1:24:05.457
The answer to that
question is yes...

1:24:05.540 --> 1:24:06.791
So here is
the question,

1:24:06.875 --> 1:24:08.710
you've gotta
answer yourself,

1:24:08.793 --> 1:24:11.296
are you a reindeer
that rocks

1:24:11.379 --> 1:24:14.048
or are you a
reindeer that rolls?

1:24:18.553 --> 1:24:21.890
[crowd jeers]

1:24:32.567 --> 1:24:34.152
Why doesn't he speak?

1:24:34.235 --> 1:24:37.739
C'mon Hank, you can do it.

1:24:37.822 --> 1:24:38.990
CROWD: Get off!

1:24:39.073 --> 1:24:41.159
[crowd jeers]

1:24:41.242 --> 1:24:42.702
Shut up! Let him sing!

1:24:42.786 --> 1:24:43.912
I take it back!

1:24:43.995 --> 1:24:45.789
None of you are
welcome at my deli!

1:24:46.915 --> 1:24:49.375
[crowd jeers]

1:25:08.103 --> 1:25:10.855
Room for one
more elf?

1:25:14.025 --> 1:25:17.737
[crowd wails
with excitement]

1:25:22.325 --> 1:25:23.660
It's Hayden Chase!

1:25:26.871 --> 1:25:28.790
CHAAAAAASE!

1:25:36.464 --> 1:25:37.549
What are you
doing here?

1:25:37.632 --> 1:25:38.842
I wanted to see you again.

1:25:38.925 --> 1:25:40.260
What about your tour?

1:25:40.760 --> 1:25:41.845
What tour?

1:25:41.928 --> 1:25:43.137
Hey!

1:25:44.305 --> 1:25:45.223
Get away from
that loser!

1:25:45.306 --> 1:25:48.518
He's not a loser!

1:25:48.601 --> 1:25:51.521
We don't like her;
she is not a nice lady.

1:25:51.604 --> 1:25:52.897
You're getting
in that car and

1:25:52.981 --> 1:25:54.399
you're getting on that
plane to Tokyo! Missy!

1:25:54.482 --> 1:25:56.901
No Tammy! I'm going
to the airport

1:25:56.985 --> 1:25:59.571
and getting on a plane to go
home for Christmas.

1:25:59.654 --> 1:26:00.363
I built you up from nothing!

1:26:00.446 --> 1:26:03.074
You're no-one without me!

1:26:03.157 --> 1:26:05.785
You do as I say or
I will destroy you!

1:26:06.786 --> 1:26:08.705
Remember me?

1:26:08.788 --> 1:26:09.289
I work for
Miss Chase now.

1:26:09.372 --> 1:26:11.541
[she laughs]

1:26:11.624 --> 1:26:13.001
You're fired.

1:26:13.084 --> 1:26:14.711
Stings, doesn't it?

1:26:14.794 --> 1:26:17.171

1:26:19.132 --> 1:26:21.718
Yes! Ahah!

1:26:21.801 --> 1:26:23.928
Who's the loser
now, missy!?

1:26:24.012 --> 1:26:25.930
Say bye bye to
the nasty lady.

Hello? Are we doing
this show or what?

1:26:43.364 --> 1:26:44.532
You ready?

1:26:44.616 --> 1:26:46.868
Where's the mistletoe
when you need it?

1:26:49.203 --> 1:26:51.915
