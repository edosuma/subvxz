00:44.567 --> 00:46.000
AAH...!

00:46.067 --> 00:47.667
HANK, MY MOWER
WON'T START.

00:47.732 --> 00:49.432
MIND IF I BORROW YOURS?

00:49.500 --> 00:51.899
( chuckling ):
ALMOST TURNED
OVER, DIDN'T SHE?

00:51.966 --> 00:54.299
( chuckling ):
YEAH, SHE WAS TEASING ME.

00:54.366 --> 00:57.033
( chuckling ):
YOU DIDN'T TRY
TO START IT, DALE.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.633
THERE WERE NO ENGINE NOISES.

00:58.700 --> 01:01.067
I'LL TRY TO START IT.

01:01.067 --> 01:02.667
CAN I BORROW SOME GAS?

01:02.732 --> 01:04.066
DON'T WASTE MY GAS.

01:04.066 --> 01:06.067
WE BOTH KNOW IT'S
NOT GOING TO START.

01:06.067 --> 01:09.067
THEN WHY MUST YOU
TORTURE ME LIKE THIS?

01:09.099 --> 01:10.766
( disgusted sigh )

01:10.832 --> 01:13.400
NOW, THAT'S WHERE
I WANT THE TANK
WHEN IT COMES BACK.

01:13.466 --> 01:15.667
WITH GAS, NOT WATER,
THIS TIME.

01:15.733 --> 01:18.432
THAT WAS AQUAHOL.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.632
DALE!

01:20.700 --> 01:22.233
( frustrated groan )

01:22.299 --> 01:24.567
Hank:
...SO I TAPPED HIM
ON THE SHOULDER

01:24.632 --> 01:26.332
AND SAID WITH
A STRAIGHT FACE

01:26.400 --> 01:28.667
"MAYBE YOU WANT TO
PUT A LITTLE LACQUER

01:28.733 --> 01:31.533
IN THAT VARNISH."

01:31.599 --> 01:35.167
UH, LONG STORY SHORT,
HE PUT SOME LACQUER IN IT.

01:35.233 --> 01:37.766
WAIT A MINUTE.
I KNOW THAT ENGINE.

01:40.567 --> 01:42.500
DAMN IT, DALE!

01:42.567 --> 01:44.332
HANK, I'M ONLY
HALFWAY DONE.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.667
YOU CAN'T GO OUT
LOOKING LIKE THAT.

01:46.733 --> 01:48.067
( gasping )

01:55.067 --> 01:57.167
HEY, I'M GOING
TO BORROW YOUR DRILL.

01:57.233 --> 01:58.533
WHERE'S MY MOWER?!

01:58.599 --> 02:01.933
OH. SO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHERE YOUR MOWER IS.

02:02.067 --> 02:02.733
YES!

02:02.799 --> 02:03.900
IT RAN OUT OF GAS

02:03.966 --> 02:05.233
DOWN PAST THE GAS STATION.

02:05.299 --> 02:06.966
I'LL HELP YOU
PICK IT UP TOMORROW.

02:07.067 --> 02:09.167
YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING
MY MOWER EVER AGAIN.

02:09.233 --> 02:10.765
YOU LEFT IT OUT
IN THE STREET

02:10.832 --> 02:13.366
WHERE ANY WEIRDO
COULD JUST RUB
UP AGAINST IT.

02:13.432 --> 02:15.266
HANK, WHAT WOULD
WEIRDOS BE DOING

02:15.332 --> 02:16.667
NEAR THE GAS STATION?

02:18.332 --> 02:22.567
WHAT WOULD WEIRDOS BE DOING
NEAR THE GAS STATION?

02:29.199 --> 02:30.800
( sighs )

02:30.866 --> 02:32.800
OH, MY GOD!

02:34.067 --> 02:35.266
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

02:35.332 --> 02:36.432
NOTHING!

02:39.099 --> 02:41.900
UH, HANK, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
FINISH MOWING MY LAWN!

02:41.966 --> 02:45.067
DON'T EVEN ASK IF YOU
CAN BORROW MY MOWER, DALE.

02:45.099 --> 02:47.366
LIKE I WOULD BORROW
THAT PIECE OF JUNK.

02:47.432 --> 02:48.699
( scoffs )

02:48.766 --> 02:50.699
BOOMHAUER, CAN I BORROW
YOUR MOWER?

02:50.766 --> 02:52.067
I'LL TELL YOU

03:02.233 --> 03:03.832
BILL, CAN I BORROW

03:03.900 --> 03:05.133
OKAY.

03:05.199 --> 03:08.067
LIKE I WOULD BORROW
THAT PIECE OF JUNK.

03:15.067 --> 03:16.667
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

03:16.733 --> 03:18.432
YOUR FLY IS DOWN.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.400
IT'S MY YARD.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.332
YEP.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.332
YEP.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.866
MM-HMM.

03:29.932 --> 03:32.332
DALE, PROBABLY DOESN'T
WANT TO SHOW HIS FACE--

03:32.400 --> 03:34.332
HIS LAWN BEING
SO SHAGGY AND ALL.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.167
HE'S FEELING
LIKE LESS THAN A MAN.

03:37.233 --> 03:39.067
CASTRATED, YOU KNOW.
I'VE BEEN THERE.

03:39.067 --> 03:40.832
WELL, DON'T FEEL
SORRY FOR DALE.

03:40.900 --> 03:43.067
DALE ABUSED OUR TRUST.

03:43.067 --> 03:44.667
( gasping )

03:44.733 --> 03:46.067
OH, MY GOD...

03:46.067 --> 03:47.900

03:49.233 --> 03:50.199
NO, IT'S DALE!

03:50.266 --> 03:52.366
ON A NEW MOWER!

03:52.432 --> 03:53.900
( horn beeping )

03:53.966 --> 03:57.866
SAY HELLO TO THE ALLEGRO X9J--

03:57.932 --> 04:01.199
CODE-NAMED REDEEMER

04:01.266 --> 04:02.866

04:02.932 --> 04:07.366
73 DECIBELS OF TWIN-BARREL,
FOUR-STROKE WAR CRY!

04:07.432 --> 04:10.699
ALL AT A PRICE
I CAN'T REALLY AFFORD.

04:10.766 --> 04:12.366
( laughing )

04:12.432 --> 04:13.832
SHE'S A BEAUTY, DALE.

04:13.900 --> 04:16.067
DID YOU GET
A GOOD TRADE-IN
ON YOUR OLD ONE?

04:16.100 --> 04:17.367
THAT THING?

04:17.432 --> 04:19.533
I PUSHED IT INTO A LAKE
THREE MONTHS AGO.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.199
Bill:
YOU LOOK SO... MANLY
SITTING UP THERE.

04:22.266 --> 04:24.300
CAN I TAKE HER
FOR A SPIN?

04:24.367 --> 04:29.199
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT WOULD
VIOLATE THE WARRANTY, BILL.

04:29.266 --> 04:31.800
OH, COME ON, DALE.
YOU USED HANK'S MOWER
AND EVERYTHING...

04:36.167 --> 04:38.699
THAT IS A WATERTIGHT SEAL.

04:38.766 --> 04:41.199
I CAN MOW MY LAWN
IN A HURRICANE.

04:41.266 --> 04:43.533
CAN YOU MOW YOUR LAWN
IN A HURRICANE, BILL?

04:43.600 --> 04:44.500
I DON'T KNOW.

04:44.567 --> 04:45.867
YOU CAN'T MOW YOUR LAWN

04:45.932 --> 04:46.867
IN A HURRICANE.

04:46.932 --> 04:48.300
CAN YOU, BOOMHAUER?

04:48.367 --> 04:50.867

BULLCORN!

04:56.067 --> 04:57.300
OH, ALMOST FORGOT.

04:57.367 --> 04:59.533
HANK, CAN YOU MOW YOUR LAWN
IN A HURRICANE?

04:59.600 --> 05:00.766
NOPE. DIDN'T THINK SO.

05:00.833 --> 05:01.899
HA-HA-HA-HA!

05:12.500 --> 05:16.167
HOW DO I KNOW
IT'S JACK RUBY'S HAT?

05:16.233 --> 05:19.167
WELL, IF I'M GOING
TO SPEND MONEY ON IT

05:19.233 --> 05:22.332
I GOT TO KNOW
IT'S JACK RUBY'S HAT.

05:22.399 --> 05:25.500
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT COLORS DOES IT COME IN?

05:25.567 --> 05:26.699
( gun pops )
AAH!

05:26.766 --> 05:28.699
( laughing )

05:28.766 --> 05:30.966
NEXT TIME IT MIGHT NOT BE A BB!

05:31.067 --> 05:33.667
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE HERE FOR.

05:33.733 --> 05:37.300
DALE, THIS ISN'T HOW
I WANTED YOU TO FIND OUT.

05:37.367 --> 05:39.667
QUIT SCREWING AROUND
WITH MY MOWER!

05:39.733 --> 05:42.167
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

05:42.233 --> 05:44.067
I DON'T KID ABOUT MY MOWER.

05:44.067 --> 05:47.632
NOW, GET INSIDE
AND START MASSAGING MY WIFE.

05:47.699 --> 05:50.667
HE'S TAKING SOME OF THE FUN
OUT OF THIS.

05:55.699 --> 05:58.067
IF DALE WATERED DOWN
THE GAS AGAIN...

05:58.067 --> 06:01.399
MMM, NOPE.
THIS IS SODA POP, HANK.

06:02.733 --> 06:04.833
THAT'S JUST GREASE.

06:04.899 --> 06:07.567
RACE YOU
AROUND THE BLOCK.

06:07.632 --> 06:10.666
YOU WRECKED MY MOWER
WITH YOUR DAMN SODA!

06:10.733 --> 06:12.333
MMM. IT'S MR. PIBB.

06:12.399 --> 06:14.333
I HEARD BOBBY
SAY HE DID IT.

06:14.399 --> 06:16.667
SAID HE HAD A SCORE
TO SETTLE WITH YOU.

06:16.733 --> 06:18.832
SOMETHING ABOUT A WOMAN.

06:18.899 --> 06:21.167
I THINK SOMETHING BAD

06:21.233 --> 06:23.332
IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN
TO THAT MOWER.

06:23.399 --> 06:25.067
OH, I DOUBT THAT, HANK.

06:25.067 --> 06:26.733
IT'S A BRAND-NEW MOWER.

06:28.399 --> 06:30.067
OH, I GET IT.

06:32.067 --> 06:33.367

07:40.233 --> 07:42.600

YOU MIGHT ASK?

07:47.766 --> 07:49.432
THE PAPER BOY.

07:51.367 --> 07:54.067
THAT'S TODAY'S PAPER, DALE.

07:54.100 --> 07:56.899
THE DATE ON MY WATCH
HAS BEEN SET INCORRECTLY.

07:56.966 --> 08:02.067
WHEN DID THE PAPER BOY
HAVE ACCESS TO MY WATCH?

08:06.833 --> 08:10.666
AAH, IT'S PROBABLY
HALFWAY TO MEXICO.

08:10.733 --> 08:13.300
THAT IS A MEXICAN DOG.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.632
OH, YOU THINK
THAT DOG DID IT?

08:15.699 --> 08:18.966
THAT DOG I-IS
UP TO NO GOOD.

08:19.067 --> 08:20.367
HANG IN THERE, DALE.

08:20.432 --> 08:22.966
EVEN IF YOU NEVER GET
TO SEE YOUR MOWER AGAIN

08:23.067 --> 08:24.800
YOU'LL STILL HAVE
THE BROCHURE.

08:24.867 --> 08:26.167
THANKS.

08:26.233 --> 08:29.067
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS
ARE MY BEST FRIENDS.

08:34.366 --> 08:36.299
( all chortling )

08:36.366 --> 08:38.299
THE JOKE'S ALWAYS
BEEN ON ME.

08:38.366 --> 08:39.832
( snickering )

08:39.899 --> 08:43.533
ALL MY LIFE, FOLKS WERE
ALWAYS PLAYING JOKES ON ME.

08:43.600 --> 08:44.966
AND NO WONDER--

08:45.067 --> 08:46.299
IT'S FUN!

08:46.366 --> 08:48.767
( evil chuckle )

08:48.832 --> 08:52.366
THIS ISN'T SOME KIND
OF ELABORATE JOKE ON ME, IS IT?

08:54.966 --> 08:57.567
( snickering )

09:00.633 --> 09:03.399
I FOUND THIS
ON OUR DOORSTEP.

09:03.466 --> 09:07.067
D-UH... THAT'S MY OIL FILTER.

09:07.100 --> 09:09.966
SUG, I'M NOT A LICENSED
BOUNTY HUNTER

09:10.067 --> 09:12.299
BUT SHOULDN'T THEY EITHER
ASK FOR RANSOM

09:12.366 --> 09:13.966
OR STOP SENDING YOU CLUES?

09:14.067 --> 09:18.167
WHY WOULD SOMEONE
SENSELESSLY TORTURE ME

09:18.232 --> 09:20.299
UNLESS THEY WERE...

09:20.366 --> 09:23.932
MY ENEMIES.

09:24.067 --> 09:26.167
BOIL UP SOME MOUNTAIN DEW.

09:26.232 --> 09:29.567
IT'S GONNA BE
A LONG NIGHT.

09:40.633 --> 09:41.966
DAD'S A THIEF.

09:42.067 --> 09:43.966
MOM, CAN I CHECK
HIS DRAWERS

09:44.067 --> 09:45.633
FOR THAT HOT WHEELS
I LOST?

09:45.700 --> 09:46.966
HANK, BOBBY TELLS ME

09:47.067 --> 09:48.966
WE HAVE A NEW VEHICLE
IN THE GARAGE.

09:49.067 --> 09:51.200
MAYBE YOU WOULD
LIKE TO EXPLAIN
TO YOUR SON

09:51.267 --> 09:53.299
WHY YOU STOLE YOUR
BEST FRIEND'S MOWER.

09:53.366 --> 09:54.832
OH. ( chuckles )

09:54.899 --> 09:57.633
UH, WELL, YOU SEE, BOBBY...

09:57.700 --> 09:59.633
UH, THIS ISN'T STEALING.

09:59.700 --> 10:03.299
WE WERE GOING TO GIVE IT BACK
AFTER WE MADE MR. GRIBBLE...

10:03.366 --> 10:06.932
UH, SOMETIMES,
THINGS THAT ARE JOKES

10:07.000 --> 10:09.633
SEEM A LITTLE MEAN,
BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY FUNNY.

10:09.700 --> 10:12.299
OH, I SEE.

10:12.366 --> 10:15.299
KIND OF LIKE WHEN THEY FED
THE FOURTH-GRADE GERBIL

10:15.366 --> 10:16.966
TO THE FIFTH-GRADE SNAKE.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.633
NO, BOBBY. THIS IS FUN.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.567
IT'S NOT MEAN OR DISHONEST.

10:20.633 --> 10:22.567
BUT DON'T TELL JOSEPH, OKAY?

10:22.633 --> 10:23.899
Peggy:
BOBBY, HONEY

10:23.966 --> 10:25.267
GO PLAY OUTSIDE.

10:25.332 --> 10:27.466
YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE
SOMETHING TO DISCUSS.

10:34.366 --> 10:36.500
ALL RIGHT, WE CAN
USE PHOTO SHOP

10:36.567 --> 10:39.299
AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
LEE HARVEY OSWALD'S

10:39.366 --> 10:40.732
RIDING ON HIS MOWER.

10:40.799 --> 10:43.832
Hank:
HAVE YOU BEEN SLEEPING, DALE?

10:43.899 --> 10:46.432
YOU GOT KIND OF THAT
COUNTY FAIR SMELL.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.732
CHECK IT OUT.

10:47.799 --> 10:50.366
IT'S FINALLY MAKING SENSE.

10:50.432 --> 10:55.932
OSWALD... MOWER...
  GRASSY KNOLL... HUH?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.399
THAT PHOTO
DOESN'T EVEN
LOOK REAL, DALE.

10:58.466 --> 11:00.667
( chuckling )

11:00.732 --> 11:02.232
WELL, I'D LIKE TO LIVE

11:02.299 --> 11:04.299
IN YOUR FAIRY-TALE
WORLD, HANK

11:04.366 --> 11:06.633
BUT THE FAIR PLAY

11:06.700 --> 11:08.767
IS RETROFITTING
MY MOWER'S ENGINE

11:08.832 --> 11:10.332
TO POWER FIDEL CASTRO'S

11:10.399 --> 11:12.567
ONE-MAN ESCAPE-SUB.

11:12.633 --> 11:16.432
HUH. DALE, WHY DON'T YOU RELAX.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.700
HAVE A BEER.

11:17.767 --> 11:18.899
NO BEER.

11:18.966 --> 11:20.866
GOT TO STAY SHARP.

11:22.767 --> 11:24.700
( chuckling )

11:24.767 --> 11:26.700
HE'S GOING CRAZY.

11:26.767 --> 11:28.466
YEAH, MAN,
TELL YOU WHAT, MAN.

11:28.533 --> 11:30.232
THAT DANG OL' MARGOT KIDDER, MAN

11:30.299 --> 11:33.267
WANDERING AROUND IN THE DANG OL'
CURLED-UP CARDBOARD BOX.

11:33.332 --> 11:34.299
♪ WHEET-WHEET. ♪

11:34.366 --> 11:36.067
YEAH, BUT I THINK

11:36.067 --> 11:39.133
WE OUGHT TO GIVE
THE MOWER BACK.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.567
WE'RE PUTTING EXTRA STRESS
ON A STRUCTURE

11:41.633 --> 11:44.100
THAT WASN'T UP TO CODE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

11:44.167 --> 11:45.633
LET'S TELL HIM IT WAS US.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.500
WELL, THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

11:47.567 --> 11:49.899
IT'S NOT YOUR NAKED BUTT
IN THAT PICTURE.

11:49.966 --> 11:51.966
YOU TOOK
THE MONEY.

11:52.067 --> 11:53.567
STILL...

12:02.966 --> 12:04.299
It's me, Sug.

12:04.366 --> 12:05.432
NANCY?

12:05.500 --> 12:07.067
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BUZZ YOU IN.

12:10.100 --> 12:13.899
( making long buzzing sound )

12:14.966 --> 12:16.633
SHOULDN'T YOU GET SOME SLEEP?

12:16.700 --> 12:17.899
SLEEP?

12:17.966 --> 12:20.366
I'VE NEVER FELT SO ALIVE.

12:23.700 --> 12:26.832
THIS IS WHERE ALL THE
PREPARATION PAYS OFF.

12:29.366 --> 12:30.432
THE BINGING.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.633
THE PURGING.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.533
THE CONSTANT INOCULATIONS.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.767
( phone ringing )

12:35.966 --> 12:37.332
IT'S ME.

12:37.399 --> 12:40.899
( lawnmower motor
 running sounds )

12:40.966 --> 12:43.633
( Bill giggling on phone )

12:43.700 --> 12:46.567
THEY KNOW I'M GETTING CLOSE.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.299
SUG, YOU'VE GOT
TO GET UP EARLY

12:48.366 --> 12:50.633
TO KILL THE TERMITE
LARVA AT THE COLLEGE.

12:50.700 --> 12:53.633
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO STAY DOWN HERE
ALL NIGHT, ARE YOU?

12:53.700 --> 12:55.366
TIME HAS NO MEANING FOR ME.

12:55.432 --> 12:56.533
WHAT IS IT?

12:56.600 --> 12:58.767
1:00 A.M.? 3:00 A.M.?

12:58.832 --> 13:00.500
IT'S 6:00.

13:00.567 --> 13:02.167
A.M.?

13:02.232 --> 13:03.167
NO.

13:03.232 --> 13:04.232
OH.

13:04.299 --> 13:06.366
IS DINNER READY?

13:06.432 --> 13:08.700
ALL RIGHT, I WAS
GOING TO HAVE JANE FONDA

13:08.767 --> 13:09.932
OBSERVING THE AUTOPSY.

13:10.067 --> 13:11.500
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
IS THAT TOO MUCH?

13:11.567 --> 13:14.067
THE BOY AT KINKO'S SAID
IT WAS TOO MUCH.

13:14.100 --> 13:15.432
( sighs )

13:15.500 --> 13:18.432
WELL, WHEN HE GETS HOME,
TELL HIM IT WAS A JOKE

13:18.500 --> 13:22.167
AND THE MOWER WAS COMFORTABLY
LUBRICATED AT ALL TIMES.

13:22.232 --> 13:23.932
OKAY.

13:24.067 --> 13:26.700
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'D WANT TO FOOL
DALE LIKE THAT.

13:26.767 --> 13:28.067
I MEAN,
IT'S NOT HARD

13:28.100 --> 13:29.899
IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY
HE TRUSTS.

13:29.966 --> 13:32.732
BUT, HEY, WHATEVER
TURNS YOU ON.

13:32.799 --> 13:35.567
THAT'S WHAT
I ALWAYS SAY.

13:37.466 --> 13:39.100
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO SPEAK CLEARER.

13:39.167 --> 13:40.567
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
WHATEVER IT IS

13:40.633 --> 13:42.167
THAT YOU'RE EATING, BILL,
TAKE IT OUT.

13:42.232 --> 13:44.232
OUT! OUT! TAKE IT OUT!

13:44.299 --> 13:47.067
OKAY, THAT'S BETTER.
THANK YOU.

13:47.133 --> 13:48.133
UH-HUH.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.432
HANK, IT'S BILL.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.500
HE SAYS DALE'S
GONE CRAZY.

13:51.567 --> 13:55.366
I WAS AT JUNIOR COLLEGE PLAYING
SOME PINBALL WITH THE BOYS

13:55.432 --> 13:57.133
AND DALE'S UP IN THE TOWER.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.799
HE'S UP THERE WITH A GUN!

13:58.866 --> 14:00.432
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.067
DON'T CALL THE POLICE

14:02.100 --> 14:03.567
unless Dale starts shooting.

14:03.633 --> 14:05.533
OKAY-- I ALREADY
CALLED THE POLICE.

14:08.700 --> 14:09.832
WHAT THE...?

14:09.899 --> 14:10.899
CLEAR THE AREA.

14:10.966 --> 14:11.899
GO, GO, GO!

14:11.966 --> 14:13.133
GET SOME SHARP SHOOTERS

14:13.200 --> 14:14.799
ON THE ROOF
ACROSS THE STREET-- NOW!

14:14.866 --> 14:17.832
( humming )

14:24.899 --> 14:26.067
WHERE IS HE?

14:26.067 --> 14:27.466
IS HE STILL UP
IN THE TOWER?

14:27.533 --> 14:28.832
WHO? THE SNIPER?

14:28.899 --> 14:30.832
HE'S NOT A SNIPER,
HE'S MY FRIEND.

14:30.899 --> 14:32.667
DALE WOULDN'T
SHOOT ANYBODY.

14:32.732 --> 14:35.232
BUT HE IS PRESIDENT
OF THE GUN CLUB.

14:35.299 --> 14:37.366
YES, HE IS PRESIDENT.

14:37.432 --> 14:41.267
BUT ONLY BECAUSE HE OWNS
THE MOST GUNS.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.767
YES, IT'S ALL A BIG JOKE,
ISN'T IT?

14:45.832 --> 14:47.366
UNTIL SOMEONE GETS HURT.

14:47.432 --> 14:48.667
MR. GRIBBLE

14:48.732 --> 14:50.366
WE HAVE THE TOWER SURROUNDED.

14:50.432 --> 14:51.600
PUT DOWN YOUR GUN.

14:58.232 --> 15:00.167
IT'S JUST A WAND.

15:01.633 --> 15:04.299
( screaming )

15:14.799 --> 15:16.232
THAT'S RIGHT, DALE!

15:16.299 --> 15:17.667
SHOW 'EM WHO'S BOSS!

15:19.432 --> 15:21.633
THE POLICE AREN'T
TRAINED FOR THIS.

15:21.700 --> 15:22.966
LET'S GO, GUN CLUB.

15:23.067 --> 15:24.700
BUT DALE'S
OUR PRESIDENT.

15:24.767 --> 15:26.100
I DIDN'T VOTE
FOR HIM.

15:26.167 --> 15:28.232
Dale:
I HAVE A HOSTAGE.

15:28.299 --> 15:30.167
A RUSTY SHACKELFORD.

15:30.232 --> 15:32.133
( Rusty's voice ):
GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS.

15:33.299 --> 15:34.866
I CAN'T SEE THE HOSTAGE.

15:34.932 --> 15:36.366
THERE IS NO HOSTAGE.

15:36.432 --> 15:38.700
"RUSTY SHACKELFORD"
IS THE FAKE NAME

15:38.767 --> 15:40.067
HE ORDERS PIZZA WITH.

15:40.133 --> 15:41.600
LOOK, HERE'S HIS MOWER.

15:41.667 --> 15:43.432
THIS WAY, SIR.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.899
JUST TELL HIM
YOU'VE GOT HIS MOWER

15:45.966 --> 15:47.399
AND THAT IT'S SAFE.

15:47.466 --> 15:49.732
WE HAVE YOUR MOWER.

15:49.799 --> 15:52.267
I KNOW THAT, FIDELITO.

15:52.332 --> 15:54.067
HANK, I WAS RIGHT.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.432
THESE CUBANS HAVE MY MOWER.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.700
WATCH OUT!

15:57.767 --> 16:00.466
OH... PLEASE,
THIS IS MY FAULT.

16:00.533 --> 16:04.633
DALE, COME DOWN HERE
BEFORE SOMEBODY GETS HURT!

16:04.700 --> 16:05.832
TOO LATE.

16:05.899 --> 16:07.832
I KILLED SHACKELFORD.

16:07.899 --> 16:10.133
( gasps )

16:10.200 --> 16:11.633
NO, NO. CORRECTION.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.667
SHACKELFORD WANTS A PIZZA.

16:13.732 --> 16:16.167
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON UP THERE?

16:16.232 --> 16:17.966
AND I WANT MY MOWER BACK

16:18.067 --> 16:20.466
WITH ENOUGH GAS
TO GET TO CANADA.

16:20.533 --> 16:22.366
WHAT DOES THE BOOK SAY?

16:22.432 --> 16:23.700
I DON'T KNOW.

16:23.767 --> 16:26.932
UH... MAYBE...
TEAR GAS.

16:27.067 --> 16:28.332
...AN APOLOGY.

16:28.399 --> 16:30.167
I WANT THE CIA
TO SELL OFF

16:30.232 --> 16:31.432
ITS FANTASTIC SAMS

16:31.500 --> 16:33.732
HAIRSTYLE AND SUBSIDIARY.

16:35.767 --> 16:37.767
( sniffing )

16:37.832 --> 16:40.667
AAH. IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?

16:40.732 --> 16:45.200
I USE STRONGER THAN THIS
TO KILL SQUIRRELS.

16:47.232 --> 16:50.633
Boomhauer:
HEY, YO, DALE, MAN.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.500
COME ON, MAN.
WHAT YOU DOING UP THERE?

16:52.567 --> 16:54.966
MAN, ALL COMIN' CRAZY, MAN.
COME ON DOWN, MAN...

16:55.067 --> 16:59.332
BOOMHAUER, IF I EVER HEARD
ANYONE READING A SCRIPT

16:59.399 --> 17:00.767
THAT WAS IT.

17:09.767 --> 17:10.732
Hank:
WAIT, NO!

17:10.799 --> 17:12.200
LET ME GO UP THERE.

17:12.267 --> 17:13.665
HE'LL LISTEN TO ME.

17:13.732 --> 17:14.833
WELL, GEE, HANK

17:14.900 --> 17:16.067
I'D THINK YOU'D BE THE PERSON

17:16.098 --> 17:17.400
DALE WOULD MOST WANT TO KILL.

17:17.467 --> 17:19.333
HANK, I LOVED DALE, TOO

17:19.400 --> 17:22.400
BUT THE DALE WE KNEW
NO LONGER EXISTS.

17:22.467 --> 17:24.866
NOW, THERE'S JUST A
BLOODTHIRSTY MAD DOG

17:24.932 --> 17:26.400
OUT TO KILL, KILL, KILL.

17:26.467 --> 17:27.400
OH...

17:27.467 --> 17:28.833
OFFICER, PLEASE

17:28.900 --> 17:30.400
LET ME GO.

17:31.599 --> 17:33.532
IF HE STARTS FREAKING OUT,
JUST DUCK

17:33.599 --> 17:35.532
AND WE'LL SHOOT HIM
IN THE HEAD.

17:35.599 --> 17:37.200
DON'T SHOOT HIM IN THE HEAD.

17:37.267 --> 17:39.133
BOOK SAYS "HEAD."

17:43.432 --> 17:44.900
Hank:
HEY, DALE?

17:44.967 --> 17:48.099
DALE, IT'S HANK HILL,
YOUR FRIEND.

17:48.166 --> 17:52.299
OUR THIRD-GRADE TEACHER
WAS MR. ST. GEORGE.

17:57.767 --> 17:59.366
OH, I KNEW IT.

17:59.432 --> 18:02.900
THERE'S NO GUN,
SO YOU CAN ALL GO HOME NOW.

18:02.967 --> 18:04.900
DRIVE SAFELY.

18:04.967 --> 18:07.467
Sergeant ( on radio ):
We're not quite done here.

18:07.532 --> 18:10.767
Why don't you bring Mr. Sniper
down and we'll talk this over.

18:10.833 --> 18:12.400
NO. THAT'S THEIR PLAN.

18:12.467 --> 18:16.267
ONE SHOT ON THE WAY DOWN
ELIMINATES THE GRIBBLE PROBLEM.

18:16.333 --> 18:18.267
THEN THE CUBAN ROBOT SOLDIERS

18:18.333 --> 18:23.067
HAVE ONLY STEVE WYNN
STANDING BETWEEN
THEM AND WICHITA.

18:23.133 --> 18:24.567
DALE, THERE ARE NO ROBOTS

18:24.633 --> 18:26.067
AND THERE ARE NO CUBANS.

18:26.133 --> 18:27.599
IF THERE ARE NO CUBANS

18:27.666 --> 18:29.599
HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT
FOR DESI ARNAZ?

18:29.666 --> 18:31.400
OKAY, THERE ARE CUBANS

18:31.467 --> 18:33.900
BUT THEY HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH... ( sighs )

18:33.967 --> 18:36.267
ALL RIGHT. YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

18:36.333 --> 18:37.833
WHEN YOU GOT YOUR MOWER

18:37.900 --> 18:40.732
YOU WERE SORT OF ACTING
LIKE A JERK, AND...

18:40.799 --> 18:43.400
WELL, I'M NOT PROUD
OF WHAT I DID, BUT...

18:43.467 --> 18:46.932
Sergeant:
Mr. Hill, move six inches
to your left to clear a path

18:47.067 --> 18:49.900
for the you-know-what
into Mr. Gribble's head.

18:49.967 --> 18:51.932
NO!

18:52.067 --> 18:55.267
LISTEN, DALE, WE'RE THE ONES
WHO TOOK YOUR MOWER.

18:55.333 --> 18:57.799
BILL, BOOMHAUER AND ME--
YOUR FRIENDS.

18:57.866 --> 18:58.967
IT WAS MY IDEA.

18:59.067 --> 19:03.067
UH... WH... WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

19:03.099 --> 19:05.366
Mr. Hill, you dropped something.

19:05.432 --> 19:06.700
Don't you want to bend down...

19:06.767 --> 19:07.700
CUT IT OUT.

19:07.767 --> 19:09.432
PLEASE, DALE,
COME ON DOWN

19:09.500 --> 19:11.500
BEFORE YOU
GET YOURSELF KILLED.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.166
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

19:13.232 --> 19:15.366
THE ONLY POSSIBLE SCENARIOS

19:15.432 --> 19:18.500
ARE CASTRO'S ESCAPE-SUB
OR YOU TOOK IT

19:18.567 --> 19:21.067
AND YOU WOULD NEVER BETRAY ME.

19:21.067 --> 19:22.166
( sighs )

19:22.232 --> 19:23.532
WE TOOK IT, DALE.

19:23.599 --> 19:26.833
YOU, UH, WROTE YOUR NAME
UNDER THE SEAT.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.099
CALLED YOURSELF A COLONEL.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.500
IT WAS JUST A JOKE.

19:32.567 --> 19:34.833
JOKES START WITH
"KNOCK, KNOCK"

19:34.900 --> 19:38.067
OR "WHAT DO YOU GET
WHEN YOU CROSS A..."

19:38.067 --> 19:42.133
YOU KNOW, YOU USED TO BE
ON MY LIST OF TRUSTABLES

19:42.200 --> 19:44.232
AND IT WAS A
VERY SHORT LIST.

19:44.299 --> 19:46.866
I WASN'T EVEN ON IT.

19:46.932 --> 19:50.232
BUT NOW... I
JUST DON'T KNOW.

19:50.299 --> 19:53.799
I GUESS YOU'RE
NOT MY FRIEND.

19:53.866 --> 19:56.633
DALE, IF I COULD
DO IT AGAIN, I'D...

19:56.700 --> 19:58.532
HEY, WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?

19:58.599 --> 20:00.099
I AM TOO YOUR FRIEND.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.432
I'M AS GOOD A FRIEND

20:01.500 --> 20:03.666
AS A WEIRDO LIKE YOU
IS EVER GOING TO HAVE.

20:03.732 --> 20:05.866
NOW, COME ON,
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

20:05.932 --> 20:07.267
DO YOU TRUST ME OR NOT?

20:18.532 --> 20:21.467
ATTENTION, MEN IN POLICE SUITS:

20:21.532 --> 20:23.467
I HAVE DECIDED TO
TRUST YOUR PATSY--

20:23.532 --> 20:25.432
MY GOOD FRIEND
HANK HILL.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.467
NOT YET.

20:30.532 --> 20:31.866
I'M COMING DOWN.

20:31.932 --> 20:34.166
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SHOOT ME

20:34.232 --> 20:36.700
I WANT BOBBY HILL
TO TAKE THE SHOT

20:36.767 --> 20:39.500
BECAUSE BOBBY WILL
PUT ME DOWN CLEAN.

20:39.567 --> 20:40.900
OKAY.

20:42.599 --> 20:44.200
STAY CALM.

20:44.267 --> 20:46.032
IF THEY WERE
GOING TO SHOOT YOU

20:46.099 --> 20:47.767
THEY'D HAVE
DONE IT ALREADY.

20:47.833 --> 20:50.432
THEY WANT ME TO WET
MY PANTS FROM FEAR

20:50.500 --> 20:53.032
BUT THEY'RE TOO LATE.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.200
WHO'S THAT?

21:00.267 --> 21:01.299
VIGILANTE!

21:04.366 --> 21:05.567
HANK!

21:05.633 --> 21:06.932
THERE HE IS!
UP ON THE ROOF!

21:07.067 --> 21:08.767
HANK, NO! UH...

21:08.833 --> 21:11.366
HANK, NO, DON'T-DON'T DIE.

21:11.432 --> 21:13.267
OH, GOD, YOU'RE DYING.

21:13.333 --> 21:14.567
( gasps )

21:14.633 --> 21:16.567
I'LL NEVER
FORGET YOU, HANK.

21:16.633 --> 21:18.866
I WILL BURY YOU
IN MY BACKYARD.

21:18.932 --> 21:21.900
I'LL-I'LL DEDICATE
MY LIFE TO PROPANE

21:21.967 --> 21:24.432
AND DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT PEGGY.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.767
I'LL KEEP BILL
AWAY FROM HER.

21:26.833 --> 21:28.166
I'M FINE, DALE.

21:28.232 --> 21:29.967
BUT IF YOU'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT THE PROPANE

21:30.067 --> 21:31.500
I'VE GOT SOME PAMPHLETS...

21:31.567 --> 21:32.833
YOU'RE FINE!

21:32.900 --> 21:36.532
YOU'RE WEARING
A BULLETPROOF VEST.

21:36.599 --> 21:38.833
YOU THOUGHT I WAS
GOING TO SHOOT YOU.

21:38.900 --> 21:42.366
WELL, THAT, OR SPRAY ME
WITH POISONOUS CHEMICALS.

21:42.432 --> 21:45.500
I THOUGHT YOU'D KILL YOURSELF
RIGHT AFTER.

21:46.833 --> 21:48.833
I WOULD HAVE, TOO.

22:27.299 --> 22:28.666
CAN YOU MOW YOUR LAWN
 IN A HURRICANE?

22:28.732 --> 22:29.900
NOPE. DIDN'T THINK SO.
 HA-HA-HA-HA!
