WEBVTT

00:05.256 --> 00:07.417
Crichton:
Oh, you have got to be kidding!

00:07.508 --> 00:11.217
Tell me there is some kind of
sick punchline coming.

00:11.304 --> 00:12.419
Zhaan:
Unfortunately, John, it's true.

00:12.513 --> 00:16.051
Great!
Abso-fudging-Iutely great.

00:16.142 --> 00:17.382
We must go after him.

00:17.476 --> 00:19.853
No, two pods out there would
just compound the problem.

00:19.937 --> 00:22.349
No change in his course.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.351
He's accelerating away
from Moya.

00:24.442 --> 00:25.727
Let's be anything but surprised.

00:25.818 --> 00:27.809
Our weakest link is often
the smallest.

00:27.904 --> 00:30.190
Can't we do something?
He's about to exit the
asteroid field.

00:30.281 --> 00:33.193
Peacekeepers haven't spotted
him yet, but they will
shortly. Pilot?

00:33.284 --> 00:35.991
I shall attempt to contact
him again.

00:36.078 --> 00:39.491
Rygel, please respond.

00:41.209 --> 00:45.293
Your Eminence,
I beg you, respond.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.041
Remember, Rygel, Moya's
baby has weaponry.

00:48.132 --> 00:52.125
Rygel's already too distant,
and the asteroids block
a clear salvo.

00:52.220 --> 00:55.053
Rygel, listen to me.

00:55.139 --> 00:58.006
And listen very, very carefully.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.306
Hmm?

00:59.393 --> 01:03.978
Tre bawk ru fishalto chenias
prami bukeko.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.930
Huh.

01:06.025 --> 01:08.016
What the hell did you just say?

01:08.110 --> 01:11.773
Something about his corpse
and a body function.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.570
Oh, that'll help.

01:13.658 --> 01:15.819
Rygel, what you are
doing is wrong.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.070
To you, maybe.

01:17.161 --> 01:19.152
Rygel, they'll take
your head off.

01:19.247 --> 01:22.159
Whatever deal you cut with them,
Crais will never honor it.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.241
Rygel, kill your engines,
float dead.

01:24.335 --> 01:26.667
Maybe they won't spot you;
let's talk about this.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.836
And isn't that the whole
point, Crichton?

01:28.923 --> 01:31.164
That's all your people
ever do is talk.

01:31.259 --> 01:34.877
lam a Dominar of action.

01:41.227 --> 01:45.095
One unarmed transport flying
straight towards us.

01:45.189 --> 01:46.395
Makes no sense.

01:46.482 --> 01:51.476
A pity we can't follow its
trail back to the Leviathan.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.982
Any other vessels in motion
out there?

01:54.073 --> 01:59.909
Just our own outbound Marauder
with the alien girl you adopted.

01:59.996 --> 02:03.238
Have you found my Security
Officer assigned to watch her?

02:03.332 --> 02:07.996
Why would the Hynerian be
traveling alone?

02:09.922 --> 02:18.216
Perhaps he wishes to become
part of your collection.

02:20.016 --> 02:22.803
This is just a game
to you, isn't it?

02:23.352 --> 02:25.843
On the contrary.

02:25.938 --> 02:29.396
I care a great deal about
one thing.

02:29.483 --> 02:34.978
The knowledge of wormhole
technologies the human Crichton
holds locked in his memory.

02:38.617 --> 02:43.611
Sirs. This Hynerian royal was
alone aboard the Leviathan
transport.

02:43.706 --> 02:45.446
You want the Leviathan,

02:45.541 --> 02:47.702
the Leviathan gunship offspring,

02:47.793 --> 02:49.704
the other escaped prisoners,

02:49.795 --> 02:52.286
the defector Aeryn Sun,

02:52.381 --> 02:56.624
and especially you want the
one called Crichton.

02:56.719 --> 03:00.553
Well, I want my freedom.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.550
Interested?

03:07.438 --> 03:09.349
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

03:09.440 --> 03:12.773
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

03:12.860 --> 03:15.351
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship.

03:15.446 --> 03:19.109
A living ship full of strange
alien life-forms...

03:19.200 --> 03:20.030
Help me...

03:20.117 --> 03:21.232
Listen, please.

03:21.327 --> 03:23.409
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:23.496 --> 03:27.580
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

03:27.666 --> 03:29.952
...doing everything I can...

03:30.044 --> 03:32.410
I'm just looking for
a way home.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.728
They may not be on their way
now, but they will be coming.

03:58.823 --> 04:01.314
If the Peacekeepers knew where
we were, D'Argo, they'd
be here already.

04:01.409 --> 04:04.776
Look, is it possible he's
just stalling for us?

04:08.040 --> 04:10.952
Right. Okay. Well, let's think
this through. What do we know?

04:11.043 --> 04:13.079
The map of this asteroid field
you took from the botanist

04:13.170 --> 04:16.879
has allowed Pilot to plot
Starburst path away from
the Peacekeepers.

04:16.966 --> 04:18.297
Moya will not abandon her baby.

04:18.384 --> 04:20.090
Who is too young to Starburst
on his own.

04:20.177 --> 04:23.169
Is there any way we can use
the offspring's weaponry to
our advantage?

04:23.264 --> 04:27.223
Well, against a Command Carrier,
until he's fully grown, it'll be
like throwing stones.

04:27.309 --> 04:30.016
Well I can tell you this for
free. I will not be taken alive.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.720
I've been in the goddamn chair
and I am not going back in it.

04:32.815 --> 04:35.181
I know of the concept, but
there is no Luxan word for it.

04:35.276 --> 04:38.518
-Suicide?
-I am not talking about suicide.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.477
But it doesn't look like we're
going to get out of this one,

04:40.573 --> 04:42.905
and if we're going to go down,
I want to go down swinging.

04:42.992 --> 04:44.528
Then we shall do so together.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.985
Oh, just to be in the warm glow
of all this testosterone.

04:48.080 --> 04:52.119
The smallest ship Crais and
Scorpius will send can
overpower us effortlessly.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.540
Okay. What'd we see?

04:53.627 --> 04:57.119
Rygel flew that Transport
right into their ship.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.125
Presumably screaming "l
surrender" all the way.

04:59.216 --> 05:02.174
Yeah, but what if one of us
did the same thing, but
at the last second,

05:02.261 --> 05:04.547
veered off straight into the
bridge? A Trojan horse.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.094
Won't cripple their operations.

05:06.182 --> 05:08.889
And what if the transport is
loaded down with explosives?

05:08.976 --> 05:11.137
What if we blow the holy hell
out of their nerve center?

05:11.228 --> 05:14.891
Would that buy us enough time
for the rest of us to get away?

05:22.948 --> 05:24.404
That's your third helping.

05:24.492 --> 05:27.199
Mmm. That's for my
third stomach.

05:27.286 --> 05:28.867
That's what happens, you see?

05:28.954 --> 05:31.331
By the time it's full, the
first one's empty again.

05:31.415 --> 05:37.786
Dominar Rygel, my Gammak Base
is but a short distance away.

05:37.880 --> 05:41.919
Once seated in my Aurora Chair,
your hunger pangs...

05:42.009 --> 05:43.294
( belches )

05:43.385 --> 05:45.171
will be the least of
your discomforts.

05:45.262 --> 05:48.425
Um, with all due respect, wrong.

05:48.516 --> 05:51.303
You won't get anything
out of me that way.

05:51.393 --> 05:52.553
Ask him.

05:52.645 --> 05:54.385
My physiology won't
tolerate it.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.311
He would be dead
almost instantly.

05:56.398 --> 05:58.855
Oh, no need to travel to
accommodate that.

05:58.943 --> 06:03.061
Look, if I were afraid, I
wouldn't have come, would I?

06:03.155 --> 06:05.487
Pass the terleum mollusks,
please?

06:08.285 --> 06:13.325
I believe your offer

06:13.415 --> 06:19.331
was the capture of John Crichton
in exchange for your
own freedom.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.286
And the Leviathan and
the others...

06:21.382 --> 06:23.373
Insignificant, Captain.

06:27.297 --> 06:27.388
A simple deal, to which I agree.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.878
Hardly simple.

06:28.973 --> 06:33.888
I also require a ship,
a qualified crew,
negotiable currency,

06:33.978 --> 06:36.264
a map to my home world
and a full pardon.

06:36.355 --> 06:37.515
You're lying.

06:37.606 --> 06:38.937
All right, I could
forego the cash.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.980
You're lying about why
you're here.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.274
No, I'm not.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.226
You're wasting our time.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.312
lmprison him.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.773
We will capture the others
in due course.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.778
ldon't think so.

06:50.869 --> 06:53.611
Look, I know him.

06:53.706 --> 06:57.369
John Crichton will not
be taken alive.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.706
Now he's telling the truth.

07:03.757 --> 07:08.217
And are you willing to help me
capture the human, Crichton?

07:12.182 --> 07:13.592
Chiana:
I will not!

07:13.684 --> 07:15.390
You can't make me.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.433
Listen, Chiana, it is
the only way.

07:17.521 --> 07:20.263
What do you care?
You'll be dead!

07:22.234 --> 07:25.522
You are the only one of us who
the Peacekeepers do not hunt.

07:25.613 --> 07:28.320
I went down to their base with
Crichton. They know who I am.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.898
That is why you must wear
these restraints.

07:30.993 --> 07:33.700
I doubt I'll be able to subdue
them with those.

07:33.787 --> 07:37.120
When they board Moya, lock
yourself in one of the cells,

07:37.207 --> 07:40.165
slip these on and maintain no
matter how many times they ask,

07:40.252 --> 07:41.662
that we forced you to help.

07:41.754 --> 07:44.336
Don't tell me how to lie.
It's one of the best
things I do!

07:44.423 --> 07:47.039
You are a real pain in the eema!

07:49.595 --> 07:52.553
But one that l have
grown to enjoy.

07:55.476 --> 07:58.934
Exactly how volatile is
this lutra oil?

07:59.021 --> 08:00.682
Not at all.

08:00.773 --> 08:04.937
But once it's injected into
containers filled with
kronite shavings

08:05.027 --> 08:07.643
from the floor of Moya's
cargo hold,

08:07.738 --> 08:11.105
the mix becomes
highly explosive.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.158
Almost anything will
set it off.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.611
Say like, a high-speed impact?

08:19.458 --> 08:22.040
John, are you sure there's
no other way?

08:23.420 --> 08:25.752
(laughing)

08:25.839 --> 08:27.124
Oh, yeah.

08:27.216 --> 08:30.424
Ah, the tools of the
chief anarchist.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.595
John?

08:35.683 --> 08:38.720
I've made new family here
surrounded by all of you

08:38.811 --> 08:40.847
but now I sense it's
coming to an end.

08:40.938 --> 08:46.854
Well, it's a Jerry Springer
kind of family,

08:46.944 --> 08:49.902
but for what it's worth, Zhaan,

08:49.988 --> 08:52.365
you are family.

08:54.535 --> 09:01.657
I appreciate your concern,
Officer Sun, but I no longer
require a chaperone.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.866
Are you sure, Pilot?

09:03.961 --> 09:05.622
You seemed quite upset.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.624
Yes.

09:07.715 --> 09:11.879
Moya is terrified for her
offspring and herself.

09:11.969 --> 09:16.178
That anxiety translates through
her being into mine.

09:16.265 --> 09:19.302
Combine it with my
own fear, and...

09:19.393 --> 09:23.682
Pretty potent adrenaline surge
for you. I understand.

09:26.442 --> 09:28.683
Officer Sun.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.027
Aeryn.

09:33.115 --> 09:39.452
You and l, we've shared quite
a lot in the time we have
been together.

09:39.538 --> 09:42.621
DNA, for one.

09:42.708 --> 09:46.166
You've helped me learn some
rudimentary science.

09:46.253 --> 09:50.166
You've kept me alive when
no one else could.

09:50.257 --> 09:55.752
There's no reason we all
need to be recaptured.

09:55.846 --> 09:59.839
You have your Prowler.

09:59.933 --> 10:04.393
Don't think that option hasn't
entered my mind.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.224
I'm not going anywhere.

10:13.781 --> 10:19.697
Moya wants to know, have you
come up with a name for
her offspring yet?

10:19.787 --> 10:22.904
In case something happens.

10:22.998 --> 10:27.207
She doesn't want her son named
by the Peacekeepers.

10:31.048 --> 10:38.295
Please tell Moya that it remains
my honor to name her son.

10:38.388 --> 10:44.133
It will be a good, strong name
that he will bear proudly.

10:44.228 --> 10:49.973
In freedom, if I have anything
to say about it.

10:52.778 --> 10:54.939
I will tell her.

10:58.951 --> 11:06.323
Toward that end, we need the
DRDs to start scooping kronite
shavings from the cargo holds.

11:14.967 --> 11:17.299
Dad...

11:17.386 --> 11:20.128
this is probably the last note
in a bottle you're going to get.

11:20.222 --> 11:23.180
Things have gone bad
here and, uh...

11:23.267 --> 11:24.928
( recorder clicks off)

11:27.521 --> 11:32.185
Why don't I just start
screaming and leave him
a really happy memory?

11:41.243 --> 11:42.653
Is he anything like
the man I met?

11:42.744 --> 11:44.359
Oh...

11:44.746 --> 11:46.156
no,no,no,no.

11:46.248 --> 11:51.242
The man you met was an alien
who'd taken the form
of my father.

11:51.336 --> 11:54.954
But he was constructed from
your memories, so was
it accurate?

11:55.048 --> 12:00.509
A little idealized but,
uh... mostly, yeah.

12:02.431 --> 12:04.342
You're lucky, you know.

12:07.686 --> 12:11.053
When I was very young,
one night,

12:11.148 --> 12:14.857
a soldier appeared over
my bunk,

12:14.943 --> 12:17.104
battle hardened, scarred.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.901
Cool, your father.

12:18.989 --> 12:21.025
My mother.

12:21.116 --> 12:26.110
She told me that I wasn't
merely an accident or a genetic
birthing to fill the ranks,

12:26.204 --> 12:32.165
that she and a male that she
had cared about had chosen
to yield a life.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.288
Mine.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.711
And what about your father?

12:36.798 --> 12:39.084
I know even less.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.256
Well...

12:46.391 --> 12:49.303
leave him a message.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.180
You never know.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.228
He might get it.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.569
(groaning)

13:27.516 --> 13:28.926
Excuse me.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.553
Do you mind?

13:34.398 --> 13:36.309
You have eaten.

13:37.109 --> 13:39.566
You have bathed.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.689
What next? A nap?

13:41.780 --> 13:43.486
Hmm, as a matter of fact...

13:43.573 --> 13:48.784
We must talk about your future.

13:48.870 --> 13:52.704
Hmph! You're clearly not the
one to decide my future, Crais.

13:52.791 --> 13:53.997
What do you mean?

13:54.084 --> 13:56.621
Well, you've lost control here,
haven't you?

13:56.712 --> 14:00.375
Not that it troubles me, but
this Scorpius fellow.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.922
He's obviously the one
in power now.

14:03.010 --> 14:08.346
Be that as it may, allow me to
make a case for my value
in these...

14:08.432 --> 14:11.094
negotiations, Your Highness.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.594
Hmm?

14:20.402 --> 14:21.266
You madman!

14:21.361 --> 14:22.862
Do you know what this is?

14:22.946 --> 14:24.277
You madman!

14:24.364 --> 14:26.855
This is your death certificate.
Proof you expired.

14:26.950 --> 14:29.487
You're early.
Come back tomorrow.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.364
I am not your reaper.

14:31.455 --> 14:33.571
Scorpius is.

14:33.665 --> 14:37.658
Did you really think you could
strike an honest bargain with a
Scarran half-breed like him?

14:37.753 --> 14:40.620
The moment Crichton is in
custody he's ordered
your execution

14:40.714 --> 14:43.000
to show everyone what he
thinks of traitors.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.708
Slow death.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.260
Why tell me?

14:52.350 --> 14:58.641
Because ironically, we find
ourselves in similar situations.

14:58.732 --> 15:06.150
No matter what I do, I have no
life beyond court-martial,
incarceration, execution.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.197
So what do you want?

15:09.284 --> 15:12.276
To survive, as you do.

15:12.370 --> 15:15.362
And just how do we do that?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.494
What the frell is he
doing back?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.701
You know what he's doing back.
It's a trap.

15:20.796 --> 15:22.502
He was assuring Pilot
that it wasn't.

15:22.589 --> 15:23.669
And you believe him.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.167
Well, he wasn't followed.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.247
Which makes no sense.

15:26.343 --> 15:28.334
This is definitely a trap.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.885
They wouldn't just let Rygel
go, I'm sure of that.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.634
If given provocation, I will
shoot him in such a way

15:33.725 --> 15:36.637
that he still is able to answer
all your questions.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.558
No Peacekeeper tail ships.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.231
So far.

15:43.318 --> 15:47.527
Moya's sensors detect no
military activity directed
towards us.

15:54.121 --> 15:56.203
Please don't shoot.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.873
Of course, I would have demanded
the same precautions myself.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.872
Off the ThroneSled, Rygel, and
face down on the ground.

16:02.963 --> 16:06.296
Well, hardly. Then I'd miss
your reaction to whatever's
about to happen.

16:06.383 --> 16:13.004
And please, whatever your
reaction, don't let it
include weapons fire.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.223
(laughing)

16:24.317 --> 16:27.150
My boy Crais!

16:27.237 --> 16:29.944
Clearly an awkward situation.

16:30.031 --> 16:35.742
However, I have asked Dominar
Rygel the Sixteenth for asylum,

16:35.829 --> 16:37.285
and he has accepted.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.579
By the goddess, that's insane.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.952
What do you need asylum from?

16:42.043 --> 16:43.874
Before I can answer your
questions,

16:43.962 --> 16:47.830
I would feel safer in protective
custody, with passions calmer.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.175
Protective custody.

16:49.259 --> 16:52.592
Pilot, have the DRDs check the
Transport for tracking devices.

16:52.679 --> 16:56.922
At once. Chiana, reinstate the
cell door functions on
Tier Seven.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.008
With pleasure.

16:59.603 --> 17:01.139
Move it.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.220
As you can see, I am unarmed.

17:07.777 --> 17:12.191
As you can see, I'm
also unarmed.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.954
Crais:
You've always said you
wanted to kill me.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.577
You knew.

17:23.668 --> 17:26.045
You knew all along.

17:26.129 --> 17:27.869
Tell them.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.875
Tell them!

17:29.966 --> 17:34.209
Ka D'Argo did not commit
the crime that he was
imprisoned for.

17:36.806 --> 17:40.094
His mate was killed by
someone else.

17:41.228 --> 17:44.015
Aeryn:
Her own brother. A Peacekeeper.

17:44.105 --> 17:47.472
You knew, and you kept
him in chains?

17:47.567 --> 17:54.279
No matter what I knew, only a
tribunal order can release a
convicted murderer.

17:54.366 --> 17:56.322
Crichton:
Easy answer.

17:56.409 --> 18:00.823
Crais:
There is much in life
that is unfair.

18:00.914 --> 18:04.782
( panting ):
We are all proof of that.

18:04.876 --> 18:09.290
Crichton:
If life was fair, you'd be dead.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.342
So.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.515
Is there anything you want
to say to me?

18:26.606 --> 18:29.848
I think we covered it all when
you left me for dead in the
Aurora Chair.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.059
Good.

18:32.153 --> 18:35.771
I'm going to go and check out
their Transport. I still don't
trust either of them.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.207
(hydraulic whirring)

18:56.011 --> 18:58.002
What are you doing here, Crais?

18:58.096 --> 19:00.178
Really.

19:00.265 --> 19:04.804
I believe my best chance is to
let the Hynerian explain my
position to you.

19:04.894 --> 19:08.261
You're letting Rygel be
your advocate?

19:10.191 --> 19:12.682
You're worse off than you look.

19:12.777 --> 19:16.065
Rygel:
If you'd seen Crais aboard his
own ship, you'd know it was no act.

19:16.156 --> 19:20.115
This Scorpius character is
carrying Crais' mivonks around
in his hip pocket.

19:20.201 --> 19:23.489
So you decided to take pity
on poor Captain Crais.

19:23.580 --> 19:27.289
I don't take pity on orphans,
much less that butcher.

19:27.375 --> 19:30.663
However, as the mind that
engineered our original escape

19:30.754 --> 19:36.249
and virtually every correct
decision since then, I
recognize his value.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.208
Like Crais is really going
to help us.

19:38.303 --> 19:41.215
No choice. He's a walking
corpse on his own ship.

19:41.306 --> 19:44.139
All the more reason why
Scorpius would not let him go.

19:44.225 --> 19:47.638
Again, for the tiny part of your
brain that calculates strategy,

19:47.729 --> 19:50.345
we didn't present it that way.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.648
Crais told Scorpius that, if he
came here under a flag of truce,

19:53.735 --> 19:55.566
he'd be able to convince
you all to surrender.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.268
So Crais must know what
they're planning.

19:57.364 --> 20:00.322
Well, that could be
useful to us.

20:01.451 --> 20:02.941
Possibly.

20:03.828 --> 20:06.786
But something went wrong.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.374
You went there to sell
us out, Rygel.

20:08.458 --> 20:11.245
You bet your shiny blue ass,
I did.

20:11.336 --> 20:14.920
But I didn't. So make the
most of it now.

20:15.006 --> 20:19.716
Zhaan, do I inject the catalyst
into every one of these kronite
shaving containers,

20:19.803 --> 20:21.509
or only the first row?

20:23.681 --> 20:25.637
She didn't say.

20:27.352 --> 20:29.388
Perhaps she doesn't even know.

20:37.362 --> 20:40.525
D'Argo, there won't be much
time later.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.690
I know.

20:43.785 --> 20:48.950
We've had our differences,
but you've become someone
I rely on now.

20:49.040 --> 20:52.749
I have become similarly
affected.

20:55.505 --> 20:58.212
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance
to meet your son Jothee.

20:58.299 --> 21:01.086
I miss being a part of his life
more and more each day.

21:01.177 --> 21:04.465
Your blood runs through him,
D'Argo. That's influence enough.

21:04.556 --> 21:06.763
I'm sure he's very
much like you.

21:06.850 --> 21:08.932
Hopefully his mother's nose.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.929
(giggles )

21:16.317 --> 21:20.276
I always thought I would
live much longer.

21:20.363 --> 21:23.105
I never thought I'd live
this long.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.701
Zhaan!

21:33.835 --> 21:35.541
Scorpius:
Report, Lieutenant.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.370
As the vector narrows,
our search team is confident

21:38.465 --> 21:40.956
of locating the Leviathan
within several arns.

21:41.050 --> 21:44.292
Excellent, Lieutenant.
Keep me informed.

21:44.387 --> 21:46.218
Any word from Captain Crais?

21:46.306 --> 21:48.422
None, sir.

21:52.729 --> 21:54.094
Sir?

21:54.189 --> 21:55.770
Permission to speak freely?

21:55.857 --> 22:02.228
Of course, Lieutenant. If you
weren't free to, I would not
have you here.

22:02.322 --> 22:07.066
If you suspected the Captain
might not return of his
own volition,

22:07.160 --> 22:09.697
why did you let him go?

22:13.541 --> 22:16.874
We all have windows
of usefulness.

22:16.961 --> 22:22.957
If we don't take advantage of
them, our careers may fade.

22:23.051 --> 22:26.168
For example,

22:26.262 --> 22:32.474
my instincts tell me that your
career may well be on the rise.

22:46.324 --> 22:48.736
How you doing?

22:49.869 --> 22:51.450
Why would you ask?

22:51.538 --> 22:54.029
I look at you,

22:55.291 --> 22:59.204
and I get homesick.

22:59.295 --> 23:04.915
I'm desperate for human male
to male conversation
and I figure...

23:06.261 --> 23:09.549
cars, football, they're
out of the question.

23:11.808 --> 23:15.892
Do you think it's an accident
our species are so much alike?

23:15.979 --> 23:18.140
Do you know the answer to that?

23:18.231 --> 23:19.346
No.

23:19.440 --> 23:23.103
It's one of the mysteries
I will miss solving.

23:23.194 --> 23:24.980
Yeah.

23:26.614 --> 23:29.276
Kind of makes you feel your
mortality, doesn't it?

23:30.243 --> 23:32.529
Being in there.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.077
That's what it's like for us,

23:35.164 --> 23:42.582
every day, every hour,
every minute,

23:42.672 --> 23:48.338
every second with you
riding our asses.

23:50.430 --> 23:54.048
I understand you didn't mean
to kill my brother.

23:56.185 --> 23:59.313
It was an accident.

23:59.397 --> 24:04.312
I realize that now, as I look
back and try to understand
it all.

24:06.237 --> 24:08.728
Do you have any idea what
you put me through?

24:09.365 --> 24:11.196
All of us, through?

24:11.284 --> 24:14.151
I thought it was about
my brother.

24:16.122 --> 24:19.330
It should have been about
my brother.

24:21.878 --> 24:26.463
Somewhere along the way
my priorities decayed.

24:26.549 --> 24:33.296
I realized l'd become more
concerned with my own
image and career.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.644
Do you mean to help?

24:41.522 --> 24:43.899
Now's the time.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.605
D'Argo:
The Transport Pod
is almost loaded.

24:48.696 --> 24:52.985
Zhaan says that there's enough
lutra oil to cause an immense
chain reaction.

24:53.076 --> 24:55.863
How long is Scorpius likely
to delay attacking us?

24:55.953 --> 24:59.366
Crais:
Once he discovers your
location, expect no delay.

24:59.457 --> 25:03.245
Fly a Transport into the bridge
of a Command Carrier?

25:03.336 --> 25:05.201
Suicide.

25:05.296 --> 25:08.129
The ship's sensors will detect
explosive content,

25:08.216 --> 25:10.332
and you will be destroyed
well out of range.

25:10.426 --> 25:14.214
Zhaan:
The kronite won't be active
until the catalyst is added.

25:14.305 --> 25:16.466
It will appear to be a
perfectly normal Transport.

25:16.557 --> 25:19.094
With weighted tonnage,
moving slowly?

25:20.978 --> 25:23.765
What do you think, Officer Sun?

25:26.359 --> 25:29.317
It's a long shot but
it's all we've got.

25:29.404 --> 25:31.144
D'Argo:
No.

25:31.239 --> 25:34.276
I have another idea.

25:34.367 --> 25:37.200
What does Scorpius value more
than this Leviathan?

25:39.372 --> 25:42.864
l'd wager that precious research
base down on that moon.

25:42.959 --> 25:45.541
The oil-covered moon.

25:46.379 --> 25:47.869
Brilliant.

25:47.964 --> 25:50.205
Light his world on fire.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.915
Rygel:
No, Scorpius is no fool.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.591
He'll never allow it.

25:54.679 --> 25:55.964
Perfect.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.262
If he is as clever as you
all say that he is,

25:58.349 --> 26:02.217
he will see the weight and
explosive content for
exactly what it is.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.563
A flying ignition source.

26:04.647 --> 26:06.228
Which would force him
to do what?

26:06.315 --> 26:10.228
Theoretically, to turn and
pursue, closing range
to destroy you.

26:10.319 --> 26:12.184
And when they change course?

26:12.280 --> 26:15.443
Moya has the time to get clear
of the asteroid field and
Starburst to freedom.

26:16.617 --> 26:18.778
-Solid, D'Argo.
-What about Moya's baby?

26:18.870 --> 26:24.456
Oh, he tucks in close and we
take him through Starburst
with us.

26:24.542 --> 26:26.783
Someone still has to
fly it, though.

26:28.796 --> 26:32.755
One of us will have to sacrifice
ourselves for the others.

26:34.051 --> 26:36.667
Crais:
Your plan is flawed.

26:36.763 --> 26:39.345
Scorpius will not chase
the Transport,

26:39.432 --> 26:43.971
because there's one thing
that he values more than
his precious base.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.274
It is not open for discussion.

26:56.365 --> 26:59.072
You're being ridiculous.
We were going to draw lots.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.115
I did draw lots.

27:00.203 --> 27:02.285
I lost, matter closed.

27:02.371 --> 27:03.872
You are not the captain here.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.821
No one is. It is anarchy.

27:05.917 --> 27:08.124
And today, it is my
day to rule.

27:08.211 --> 27:09.326
D'Argo, will you just...

27:09.420 --> 27:10.284
Listen to me!

27:10.379 --> 27:13.587
Time is short, and
so is my temper.

27:13.674 --> 27:17.212
Fetch me some more kronite!

27:17.303 --> 27:19.510
D'Argo insists on flying
this suicide mission

27:19.597 --> 27:22.930
and says I have to stay behind
and deal with Moya's offspring.

27:23.017 --> 27:24.223
Well, he's right.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.222
You're the only one of us
that the baby trusts.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.224
Have you selected a
name for him yet?

27:29.315 --> 27:32.273
No. Any suggestions?

27:32.360 --> 27:36.148
Christening a warship is
out of my purview.

27:36.239 --> 27:38.275
You know, you amaze me
being a priest.

27:38.366 --> 27:44.157
To live in a such a violent
world and yet somehow manage
to keep your center.

27:44.247 --> 27:48.240
The instant I committed murder,
l sacrificed my right to exist.

27:49.043 --> 27:52.456
Since then, I view every microt

27:52.547 --> 27:55.630
as a generous yet undeserved
gift from the goddess.

27:55.716 --> 27:56.842
Aeryn...

27:56.926 --> 27:59.167
more kronite.

28:07.937 --> 28:09.552
What's the matter?

28:09.647 --> 28:14.311
You're going flying with that
crazy Luxan, aren't you?

28:14.402 --> 28:15.812
Well, you heard Crais.

28:15.903 --> 28:19.771
Scorpius wants me, and if
I'm in the Transport

28:19.866 --> 28:24.155
it's more likely to draw the
Command Carrier away from
the rest of you guys.

28:27.331 --> 28:30.038
Well, uh...

28:30.126 --> 28:33.243
what if other people
want you too?

28:35.548 --> 28:41.088
Is this some sort of weird
alien send-off?

28:45.016 --> 28:47.428
Call it what you like.

28:48.811 --> 28:53.180
I know no other way to thank
you for what you're doing.

28:56.944 --> 29:04.817
Never before the big game, hmm?

29:07.204 --> 29:08.410
But thanks.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.910
You saved my life.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.369
Pass it on.

29:16.464 --> 29:17.795
What?

29:17.882 --> 29:21.591
When someone else needs it,
return the favor.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.378
You pass it on.

29:50.373 --> 29:54.082
High Command has responded
to your communique, sir.

29:54.168 --> 29:57.251
Due to his now prolonged
contact with the fugitives
aboard their vessel,

29:57.338 --> 30:02.674
Captain Crais has now been
officially pronounced
lrrevocably Contaminated.

30:02.760 --> 30:08.881
You are officially authorized
to take control of the
situation as you see appropriate.

30:08.975 --> 30:11.136
Congratulations, sir.

30:11.227 --> 30:14.014
Well, let's prove them correct,
Lieutenant.

30:14.105 --> 30:15.185
Search status?

30:15.272 --> 30:16.933
Any moment and we'll have them.

30:17.024 --> 30:19.766
I suggest we broadcast an
appeal for surrender.

30:19.860 --> 30:25.230
Since that'll only lead to
an act of desperation,
we attack unannounced.

30:26.283 --> 30:27.489
Orders of engagement?

30:27.576 --> 30:30.864
Cripple the Leviathan so it
can no longer function.

30:30.955 --> 30:34.573
If the offspring responds to our
signal take it into custody.

30:34.667 --> 30:37.204
If it attempts to
retaliate or flee,

30:38.379 --> 30:40.335
destroy it.

30:40.423 --> 30:43.130
You want Crichton.

30:43.217 --> 30:45.048
What of Captain Crais and
the other fugitives?

30:45.136 --> 30:47.377
Insignificant. Dispensable.

30:47.471 --> 30:49.132
Sir.

30:52.643 --> 30:55.385
Crais:
Magnificent.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.804
Kal tanega, chivoko.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.981
A crowning glory for whom?

31:01.068 --> 31:03.445
For us, Officer Sun.

31:03.529 --> 31:10.116
Peacekeeper minds who believed
that a Leviathan-warship
hybrid was possible.

31:10.202 --> 31:14.036
Are you aware of other attempts
to breed a ship such as this?

31:14.123 --> 31:15.829
Numerous.

31:15.916 --> 31:20.034
All ending disastrously,
killing both mother and child.
But now I know why.

31:20.129 --> 31:23.212
Well, the other Leviathans
were in captivity, wearing
control collars,

31:23.299 --> 31:26.006
whereas this one was free
when she gave birth.

31:26.093 --> 31:29.756
Your intelligence would qualify
significantly for promotion.

31:29.847 --> 31:33.760
Pity. I don't think a referral
from you would mean
anything now.

31:36.312 --> 31:38.303
To answer your question,

31:38.397 --> 31:43.312
this ship will have zero effect
on Scorpius, no matter how
it is used.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.986
Unlike his mother, this ship
responds to direct
voice command.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.029
By design.

31:49.116 --> 31:54.861
What captain would want a Pilot
such as the one on Moya
interpreting his commands?

31:54.955 --> 31:56.866
This ship will never
have a Pilot?

31:56.957 --> 31:58.242
It can support one but why?

31:58.334 --> 32:02.703
Why dilute the direct command
and response possibilities?

32:04.673 --> 32:06.709
Don't get too excited.

32:06.801 --> 32:10.635
If we don't escape from
Scorpius there'll be
no possibilities.

32:10.721 --> 32:14.839
Agreed. This ship would have
no part in our escape,

32:14.934 --> 32:19.394
and I repeat, our escape.

32:19.480 --> 32:23.314
Not until it is fully grown.

32:25.194 --> 32:28.732
So let's leave him
right out of it.

32:43.129 --> 32:45.461
You're not joking?
I can have your possessions?

32:45.548 --> 32:49.211
If I die and you don't,
yeah, have at it.

32:49.301 --> 32:50.757
Why?

32:50.845 --> 32:54.087
Well, you're a material kind of
guy, Rygel. Have some material.

32:54.181 --> 32:55.887
What does that mean?

32:55.975 --> 33:01.060
It means, Sparky, that you're
a soulless bastard.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.012
I am not.

33:03.107 --> 33:04.313
Hey, who knows? Maybe you'll
get lucky,

33:04.400 --> 33:06.391
we'll all die, and
you can have all our stuff.

33:06.485 --> 33:09.397
That's not fair.

33:09.488 --> 33:14.983
Sparky, Spanky, Fluffy,
Buckwheat the Sixteenth.

33:15.870 --> 33:18.202
You tried to sell us out.

33:18.289 --> 33:20.280
But I didn't, did I?

33:20.374 --> 33:23.081
They weren't buying, were they?

33:25.004 --> 33:26.540
(gasps )

33:28.549 --> 33:30.130
No.

33:30.217 --> 33:35.587
And I became convinced that
after I turned you in,
I would be next.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.137
Oh.

33:38.309 --> 33:40.015
Now how does that taste
in your mouth?

33:40.102 --> 33:45.222
Look, I know I can be selfish,
but given a chance I
can usually...

33:45.316 --> 33:49.150
Do what? Do the right thing?

33:49.236 --> 33:50.225
Yes.

33:50.321 --> 33:52.357
Rygel,

33:52.448 --> 33:55.986
I figure the right thing starts
at the beginning of the day,

33:56.076 --> 33:58.453
not after you've been caught.

34:08.297 --> 34:09.753
Thank you.

34:12.259 --> 34:14.921
For the possessions.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.847
Aeryn:
Why have you brought
us here, Chiana?

34:20.935 --> 34:25.474
Chiana:
Zhann said we still had half an
em before the final batch of lutra oil distills down.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.270
D'Argo:
So?

34:27.358 --> 34:29.474
So, I, uh...

34:29.568 --> 34:35.063
I wanted to, uh, let you all
know how much I appreciate
everything you've done for me.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.948
For each of you...

34:38.035 --> 34:40.401
your favorite dishes.

34:47.253 --> 34:49.118
Krawldar...

34:49.213 --> 34:51.955
smoked pronga sinew...

34:52.049 --> 34:54.290
Hepatian minced stew...

34:54.385 --> 34:58.378
and of course, crispy grolack.

34:59.014 --> 35:01.005
One other thing, Dad.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.341
You remember the day I left?

35:03.435 --> 35:09.271
You told me that every man has
a chance to be his own
kind of hero.

35:09.358 --> 35:12.145
Well, I don't think I'm
ever coming home,

35:12.236 --> 35:16.149
so I won't get that
ticker tape parade,

35:16.240 --> 35:18.982
and I doubt that I'm ever
going to have kids

35:19.076 --> 35:21.988
so I won't get a chance to
be a hero to them.

35:22.079 --> 35:24.786
But I think I know what
you meant.

35:26.542 --> 35:30.034
(laughing)

35:30.129 --> 35:35.965
I've got a strange life
here, Dad.

35:36.051 --> 35:40.465
It's different,
but it's my own.

35:41.849 --> 35:45.467
l have people who rely on me,

35:45.561 --> 35:47.552
people who I care about,

35:47.646 --> 35:51.559
people who mystify me,

35:51.650 --> 35:54.858
and people who've become
allies.

35:55.237 --> 35:58.229
Friends.

35:58.324 --> 36:01.282
And people who teach me
paﬂence,

36:01.368 --> 36:06.488
and people who teach me
other things.

36:08.167 --> 36:11.785
Well, you said the time would
come and I think it has.

36:13.088 --> 36:18.299
I have a job to do,
and I am unafraid.

36:18.385 --> 36:22.469
That's what you said when they
asked you what it was like
to walk on the moon.

36:27.019 --> 36:29.305
You did good, Dad.

36:30.147 --> 36:32.229
You taught me well.

36:37.571 --> 36:41.189
This is John Crichton,

36:41.283 --> 36:44.400
somewhere in the universe.

36:53.587 --> 36:58.297
Ka dare-e sincono,
apudax a-helio

36:58.384 --> 37:02.172
frotar Ii pluro sincano.

37:02.262 --> 37:06.005
In the eyes of the goddess,
all are equal, all are worthy.

37:06.100 --> 37:10.218
May yourjourney bear the
fruits of success, of safety.

37:10.312 --> 37:16.308
Any blessings earned over time
by my soul I now extend to you.

37:23.117 --> 37:24.323
I hate this stuff.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.366
Chicks love it.

37:29.331 --> 37:33.074
You know I'd do the same for
you if it made sense.

37:33.168 --> 37:35.784
No, wait, don't read into that.
It's not what I meant. Umm...

37:35.879 --> 37:38.211
Sparky, it's okay.

37:38.298 --> 37:40.163
I know what you meant, and...

37:40.259 --> 37:41.590
Thanks.

37:47.224 --> 37:52.184
So, you got any final
words of wisdom?

37:52.271 --> 37:55.729
Our pilots are trained to
expect evasive maneuvers.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.642
Fly a direct course.

38:03.365 --> 38:05.196
Right.

38:09.663 --> 38:11.654
Come back to us.

38:19.715 --> 38:23.173
This holds the holo-image of
your mate, Lolaan, and your son.

38:23.260 --> 38:25.592
Make sure that he remembers me.

38:26.472 --> 38:28.337
Remember, if you get this right,

38:28.432 --> 38:30.798
the Peacekeepers will be so
focussed on the Transport Pod

38:30.893 --> 38:32.474
they'll never notice the
two of you.

38:32.561 --> 38:34.176
-Zero margin for error.
-|'|| be there.

38:34.271 --> 38:36.432
-I can only last a quarter
of an arn...
-|'|| be there.

38:40.277 --> 38:42.108
I, uh...

38:42.196 --> 38:44.858
I wasn't going to say goodbye.

38:44.948 --> 38:47.155
Neither was I.

39:01.131 --> 39:03.463
Braca:
A Leviathan transport has
emerged from the asteroid field,

39:03.550 --> 39:06.257
just out of cannon range,
heading silka vector nine...

39:06.345 --> 39:07.630
Toward our Gammak Base?

39:07.721 --> 39:10.303
Apparently, yes. I can engage
the Prowler squadron...

39:10.390 --> 39:14.258
Until you bring me more
information, do nothing,
Lieutenant.

39:15.395 --> 39:17.226
It could be Crais.

39:18.732 --> 39:20.939
It could be anything.

39:30.911 --> 39:33.698
Zhaan said to inject the lutra
oil into the largest container.

39:33.789 --> 39:36.246
That will start the
chain reaction.

39:36.333 --> 39:39.291
How much time do we
have after it starts?

39:39.378 --> 39:43.121
She was vague to the point that
I suspect that she doesn't
have a clue.

39:43.215 --> 39:44.421
Excellent.

39:44.508 --> 39:46.169
Pilot:
Commander Crichton?

39:46.260 --> 39:47.375
Ka D'Argo, come in.

39:47.469 --> 39:49.585
Pilot, what happened to
maintaining comm silence?

39:49.680 --> 39:50.886
Pointless now.

39:50.973 --> 39:52.759
Peacekeeper voice traffic
indicates

39:52.849 --> 39:56.307
they are now aware of your
presence and your destination.

39:56.395 --> 39:57.680
Crichton:
Are they following us?

39:57.771 --> 40:01.104
Negative. They remain poised to
discover us at any moment.

40:01.191 --> 40:02.897
Good luck to you both.

40:02.985 --> 40:04.976
The visual image is
still processing,

40:05.070 --> 40:09.279
but our intra-scan reveals the
Luxan and the human to be
aboard the Transport.

40:14.204 --> 40:16.411
Break position. Go after them.

40:16.498 --> 40:20.332
And notify the base. Tell them
to expect to come under attack.

40:20.419 --> 40:22.205
But, sir, it's just one...

40:22.296 --> 40:23.502
Do it!

40:31.847 --> 40:33.633
How you doing?

40:34.308 --> 40:36.094
I have to pee.

40:38.562 --> 40:42.146
(both laughing)

40:46.945 --> 40:48.321
It worked.

40:48.405 --> 40:50.691
The Peacekeepers are withdrawing
to chase Crichton and D'Argo.

40:50.782 --> 40:53.239
Is there enough room for us to
Starburst to safety yet?

40:53.327 --> 40:54.658
Not yet.

40:54.745 --> 40:56.827
And we're going to give Aeryn
every chance we can to
rescue them.

40:56.913 --> 40:59.325
Why risk it?
They volunteered for this!

40:59.416 --> 41:01.452
Oh, quiet, Rygel!

41:01.543 --> 41:04.410
Pilot, please make sure the
baby Leviathan understands

41:04.504 --> 41:08.918
that once Moya Starbursts he
must stay close enough to be
sucked along behind us.

41:09.009 --> 41:10.374
Yes, lwill.

41:15.307 --> 41:17.389
All pursuing Prowler Commanders.

41:17.476 --> 41:20.138
This is Scorpius.

41:20.228 --> 41:25.268
The occupants of that Transport
are to be taken alive.

41:25.359 --> 41:28.772
That is my direct,
inviolate order.

41:31.406 --> 41:34.523
Crichton:
There's a fleet of bogies on
the way. Fly faster, Rasta man.

41:34.618 --> 41:36.984
If I could fly any faster,
don't you think I would?

41:37.079 --> 41:38.740
Just a figure of speech, D'Argo.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.162
Figure less and speak less.

41:41.249 --> 41:42.864
Arm the kronite shavings.

41:42.959 --> 41:44.620
I'm on it.

41:50.425 --> 41:53.713
Come on, you guys.
Do it. Do it!

41:53.804 --> 41:58.138
Pilot:
Officer Sun, the offspring is
not responding to my entreaty.

41:58.225 --> 41:59.260
Perhaps you should...

41:59.351 --> 42:01.888
Call him by his name, Pilot.

42:01.978 --> 42:03.593
You have chosen a name for him?

42:03.689 --> 42:05.179
Yes, I have.

42:05.273 --> 42:07.138
It's Talyn.

42:07.234 --> 42:10.317
It was my father's.

42:10.404 --> 42:14.192
Sensors indicate an explosive
device aboard the Transport
has just been armed.

42:14.282 --> 42:15.488
What shall we do?

42:15.575 --> 42:17.907
Admire Crichton his strategy.

42:17.994 --> 42:21.157
If he ignites the oil surface
of that moon,

42:21.248 --> 42:25.617
we will have to abandon our
research and evacuate the base.

42:25.711 --> 42:28.623
Should we shoot him down, sir?

42:28.714 --> 42:32.298
I cannot risk killing the
knowledge that he possesses.

42:32.384 --> 42:34.670
And he knows that.

42:34.761 --> 42:37.252
Das-trak krjtor!

42:42.811 --> 42:45.348
Kronite armed and cooking.

42:45.439 --> 42:47.020
Won't be long before these
babies blow.

42:47.107 --> 42:49.849
I've set a crash collision
course for the frelling moon.

42:49.943 --> 42:52.525
It's time we got out of here.

42:52.612 --> 42:57.527
Hey, D'Argo, how come
I'm not afraid?

42:57.617 --> 43:00.905
Fear accompanies the
possibility of death.

43:00.996 --> 43:03.487
Calm shepherds its certainty.

43:05.208 --> 43:06.994
I love hangin' with you, man.

43:10.005 --> 43:11.415
My Dad's good luck charm.

43:11.506 --> 43:13.497
Does it work?

43:14.342 --> 43:16.003
I'm alive.

43:18.472 --> 43:20.053
So far.

43:29.065 --> 43:30.350
Kirk and Spock.

43:30.442 --> 43:31.807
( chuckles )

43:31.902 --> 43:34.143
Abbott and Costello!

43:35.405 --> 43:36.736
First base.

43:43.747 --> 43:47.114
Aeryn, go and get them!
D'Argo can't survive for more
than a quarter of an arn.

43:47.209 --> 43:49.416
I know. Searching now.

43:51.213 --> 43:53.169
Aeryn, can you read me?

43:53.256 --> 43:56.089
Yes. But I can't see you yet.
How's D'Argo?

44:00.138 --> 44:01.844
He's good.

44:01.932 --> 44:04.264
But we may have screwed up here.

44:04.351 --> 44:07.969
The Transport should have hit
the oil sea by now.

44:14.361 --> 44:16.022
Whoo!

44:16.112 --> 44:17.397
Whoo-hoo!

44:21.993 --> 44:25.281
Ignition! Look at that
mother burn!

44:25.372 --> 44:26.327
Whoo!

44:26.414 --> 44:29.781
(laughing)

44:29.876 --> 44:32.993
All right, you guys Starburst
the hell out of here.
Don't let this be for nothing.

44:33.088 --> 44:35.204
Just relax, John.
We get one chance to grab you.

44:35.298 --> 44:36.879
That was the plan.

44:36.967 --> 44:39.333
The Peacekeepers are still
moving away from us, John.

44:39.427 --> 44:41.258
Find them, Aeryn. There's time.

44:41.346 --> 44:44.804
Someone has boarded
Moya's offspring.

44:46.434 --> 44:48.299
It's Crais.

44:52.607 --> 44:54.689
Hey, you bastards.

44:55.735 --> 44:58.317
John Crichton was here.

45:08.081 --> 45:10.447
Aeryn, where are you?

45:10.542 --> 45:12.248
I'm losing D'Argo.

45:12.335 --> 45:14.826
I can see you, John, but
there are too many other
Prowlers around.

45:14.921 --> 45:19.881
If I swing in to pick you up
they'll spot my maneuver and
shoot us all down.

45:19.968 --> 45:21.504
Just try to hang on.

45:21.595 --> 45:23.631
Pilot:
The offspring Leviathan, Talyn,

45:23.722 --> 45:27.635
has broken from Moya's side and
is operating independently.

45:27.726 --> 45:33.312
Ship, deeper into the asteroid
field where the debris
is densest.

45:33.398 --> 45:35.764
Crais, what the yotz
are you doing?

45:35.859 --> 45:38.942
Saving myself, Your Eminence.
I'm sure to your envy.

45:39.029 --> 45:41.270
Zhaan:
Talyn is not mature
enough to Starburst!

45:41.364 --> 45:45.073
If you attempt this, you will
damage him! You may die.

45:45.160 --> 45:47.276
Thank you, Priest,
but I know that.

45:47.370 --> 45:48.576
We'll be fine.

45:48.663 --> 45:51.120
Where no one can follow us,
you or the Peacekeepers.

45:51.207 --> 45:52.788
Crais, you listen to me now!

45:52.876 --> 45:56.039
You stop what you're doing and
you leave the ship now!

45:56.129 --> 46:02.341
Officer Sun, if by some strange
quirk you survive your
current situation

46:02.427 --> 46:05.510
and we manage to encounter
each other again,

46:05.597 --> 46:09.215
I hope that our relationship
away from the Peacekeepers

46:09.309 --> 46:11.265
will be a much different
one next time.

46:11.353 --> 46:13.469
You cannot take a child
from its mother!

46:13.563 --> 46:17.602
You forget. It was done to me
and it was done to you.

46:18.193 --> 46:20.309
Goodbye, Officer Sun.

46:20.862 --> 46:21.772
No!

46:21.863 --> 46:23.319
No.

46:31.915 --> 46:34.201
Oh, my Veen!

46:35.377 --> 46:37.789
The Command Carrier.

46:37.879 --> 46:39.289
It's coming back.

46:39.381 --> 46:41.167
Chiana is correct.

46:41.257 --> 46:44.875
Peacekeeper Command Carrier is
locked on to our position and
is moving in.

46:44.970 --> 46:48.133
You guys got to get out of here.
Starburst now.

46:48.223 --> 46:50.259
We can not leave you and D'Argo.

46:50.350 --> 46:53.308
No. We can't and we won't.

46:53.395 --> 46:57.354
Rygel, this is not the time
to give up selfishness.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.101
Starburst!

46:59.192 --> 47:00.648
But Aeryn's not back yet either.

47:00.735 --> 47:02.271
I'm not leaving John and D'Argo.

47:02.362 --> 47:03.272
Aeryn.

47:03.363 --> 47:05.354
Pilot, Starburst.
Save as many as you can.

47:05.448 --> 47:08.281
I believe that, too,
is now impossible.

47:08.368 --> 47:09.733
Why?

47:09.828 --> 47:12.035
Because Moya will not leave
without her offspring.

47:12.122 --> 47:17.082
She fears Talyn does not
understand what he's doing by
listening to Crais' orders.

47:17.168 --> 47:19.784
The Peacekeepers are nearly in
position to block our path.

47:19.879 --> 47:22.962
Pilot, patch me through to Moya.

47:23.049 --> 47:25.381
Uh, done.

47:25.468 --> 47:27.925
Moya, listen to me.

47:28.013 --> 47:33.178
We know how much you care about
your baby. We feel the same way.

47:33.268 --> 47:36.351
That's why we've gone to
all this trouble.

47:36.438 --> 47:41.933
It's not just to save ourselves
but to save you and him.

47:42.027 --> 47:47.363
Your only chance of rescuing
him is to save yourself first.

47:47.449 --> 47:52.318
Moya, thanks for everything.

47:52.412 --> 47:56.246
Now, do what you have to do.

47:56.332 --> 47:58.789
Fifteen microts and it won't
matter anymore.

48:04.174 --> 48:06.460
Prepare for Starburst, people!

48:10.013 --> 48:12.220
Goodbye.

48:33.161 --> 48:34.321
Aeryn?

48:34.412 --> 48:35.401
I'm still here.

48:35.497 --> 48:37.362
But I still can't get to you.

48:37.457 --> 48:39.243
It may not matter.

48:40.251 --> 48:41.957
D'Argo's unconscious.
