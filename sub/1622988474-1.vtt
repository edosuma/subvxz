WEBVTT

00:28.420 --> 00:30.463
Wait, don't run away.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.253
Come back here.

00:33.260 --> 00:34.250
Don't run away.

00:39.329 --> 00:42.079
A pet or a monster?

00:49.798 --> 00:53.498
Wherever he
is, I've got to find him,

00:53.500 --> 00:55.418
if I have to search every
street, every house,

00:55.420 --> 00:56.754
every alley, every inch of this...

01:04.400 --> 01:05.233
Come back.

01:12.789 --> 01:13.990
Hey, boy, where are you?

01:21.910 --> 01:22.978
Where are you, pal?

01:22.980 --> 01:24.103
Come here.

01:45.509 --> 01:46.926
Noah?

03:38.167 --> 03:40.933
- Did you wipe the tires off?
- Yes, Owen.

04:00.136 --> 04:01.053
Oh, okay.

04:08.960 --> 04:09.793
Shoes.

04:18.139 --> 04:22.222
Yo, I can start this over,
if you wanna watch it.

04:25.170 --> 04:27.988
It's a good one.

04:27.990 --> 04:30.958
This woman, she was walking
her dog late one night,

04:30.960 --> 04:32.498
and then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere,

04:32.500 --> 04:35.298
she gets sucked up into the
sky by extraterrestrials.

04:35.300 --> 04:36.638
Now, when she was a kid,

04:36.640 --> 04:39.128
the same thing happened
to her younger brother,

04:39.130 --> 04:40.657
but he was just five.

04:40.659 --> 04:43.278
Now, while she was in this lost spaceship,

04:43.280 --> 04:46.332
she found her long, lost younger brother,

04:47.842 --> 04:51.288
but he was still five.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.108
Oh, man, had I been abducted,

04:53.110 --> 04:55.193
I would never want to come back.

05:00.629 --> 05:03.046
You're awfully quiet tonight.

05:08.372 --> 05:10.429
What are you doing?

05:10.431 --> 05:11.264
Nothing.

05:15.521 --> 05:16.438
You sure?

05:17.580 --> 05:22.107
Yeah, yeah, I just
missed you, that's all.

05:22.109 --> 05:26.458
Uh-uh, now I know you're lying.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.468
Grab me a soda from the fridge.

05:28.470 --> 05:29.720
Geez, what are you, 13?

05:44.175 --> 05:45.888
You out of school already?

05:45.890 --> 05:46.940
It's summer, idiot.

05:51.340 --> 05:53.218
Oh, shit.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.108
Ah, ah, what time is it?

05:55.110 --> 05:56.418
Is that the time?

05:56.420 --> 05:58.157
Oh, Noah, get on your coat.

05:58.159 --> 05:59.258
We've gotta go.

05:59.260 --> 06:01.959
Come on, let's go, Noah,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

06:01.961 --> 06:05.540
Oh, shit, let's go, get up, come on, man.

06:05.542 --> 06:07.542
What are you doing, kid?

06:18.440 --> 06:22.817
Hey, let's go, let's go.

06:43.887 --> 06:45.458
- Ah, there he is.
- Hey, Joe,

06:45.460 --> 06:47.818
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Ah, don't sweat it.

06:47.820 --> 06:50.598
Right, we've got a lot to go out today.

06:50.600 --> 06:51.549
Almost forgot.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.663
- That one's kind of heavy.
- Okay.

06:59.822 --> 07:02.901
Yup, you weren't kidding.

07:02.903 --> 07:05.128
- Got it?
- Who me?

07:05.130 --> 07:06.728
Yeah, of course.

07:06.730 --> 07:09.876
Now, remember, if you
got comics, I want 'em.

07:09.878 --> 07:11.639
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:11.641 --> 07:13.048
Nostalgia's a powerful drug.

07:13.050 --> 07:14.549
Sure is.

07:14.551 --> 07:15.880
Later, Joe.

07:15.882 --> 07:16.715
Bye.

07:21.987 --> 07:22.818
Thank you.

08:14.020 --> 08:14.853
Number 46.

08:18.803 --> 08:20.803
Head out, let's go, huh?

08:24.310 --> 08:28.208
Hey,
man, don't drop the package.

08:28.210 --> 08:29.408
We need that.

08:32.178 --> 08:36.870
Boy, I love this weather.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.836
Oh, no, we don't want magazines or...

08:45.838 --> 08:47.641
It's cool, it's just a package.

08:47.643 --> 08:49.755
Oh, sweet, one sec.

08:49.757 --> 08:51.010
- Me?
- Yeah, you heard me.

08:51.012 --> 08:52.901
He wants you to fix the bell.

08:52.903 --> 08:54.798
Oh, it's just a pinball machine.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.881
Well, listen, why don't
you let me get Arland?

08:55.883 --> 08:57.098
He's got all the tools.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.010
He knows all about it.

08:58.012 --> 08:59.549
I don't know.

08:59.551 --> 09:00.718
Here you go.

09:01.825 --> 09:04.242
- Oh, thanks.
- Have a good one.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.433
Where the tips?

09:23.030 --> 09:23.863
Good?

09:24.920 --> 09:26.744
- Hungry?
- Starving.

09:26.746 --> 09:28.037
My man.

09:57.980 --> 10:00.501
Where the hell do
you think you're going?

10:00.503 --> 10:01.358
- What's it to you?
- No, no,

10:01.360 --> 10:02.618
we're not done talking yet.

10:02.620 --> 10:05.713
Yeah, well, I am.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.472
You don't make the rules
around here, you got I?

10:08.474 --> 10:10.183
Get off of me.

10:56.060 --> 10:57.508
I'm telling you, man, it was a dead body.

10:57.510 --> 10:58.588
- No way, man.
- He put it in that car.

10:58.590 --> 10:59.868
No way, you're making this up.

10:59.870 --> 11:03.668
Listen, it looked like
he put a girl in that car.

11:03.670 --> 11:04.830
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

11:07.128 --> 11:09.758
I think you've been watching

11:09.760 --> 11:10.958
too many scary movies, kid.

11:10.960 --> 11:11.793
Shut up.

11:17.350 --> 11:19.910
Hey, dude, that's expensive, man.

11:26.361 --> 11:27.778
Come on.

11:29.659 --> 11:30.808
Get out the way, get out the way.

11:30.810 --> 11:32.160
Oh, this key's not working.

11:38.230 --> 11:39.480
You okay?

11:39.482 --> 11:41.373
Just please don't let him in.

11:41.375 --> 11:46.375
Hey, hey, everything's
going to be okay, all right?

11:46.380 --> 11:48.080
I won't let him anywhere near you.

11:50.163 --> 11:52.108
Oh, shit.

11:52.110 --> 11:54.193
I know you're in there.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.503
Hey, go to the bathroom,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

12:02.610 --> 12:04.383
Come on, I'm just here for the kid.

12:05.540 --> 12:07.258
Ah, what's up, my brother?

12:07.260 --> 12:08.518
You seem very angry.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.128
Where's the kid?

12:10.130 --> 12:12.058
Huh, what, what?

12:12.060 --> 12:13.468
Listen, I don't know who you are

12:13.470 --> 12:15.768
but give me my goddamn kid and
stay the hell away from him,

12:15.770 --> 12:16.958
- got it?
- Sir,

12:16.960 --> 12:18.791
I think you have the wrong room, sir.

12:18.793 --> 12:20.806
, you goddamn fool.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.303
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.077
You good?

14:34.987 --> 14:36.803
Yeah, I'm fine, why?

14:37.800 --> 14:40.702
Well, everything go okay?

14:40.704 --> 14:41.713
What do you mean?

14:43.740 --> 14:45.628
The delivery.

14:45.630 --> 14:48.763
Oh, yeah, that,

14:50.100 --> 14:50.933
just peachy.

14:52.082 --> 14:52.915
Peachy?

14:55.267 --> 14:56.369
Dude, you're weird.

14:56.371 --> 14:57.621
Leave me alone.

15:03.800 --> 15:07.958
Oh, why today of all days?

15:07.960 --> 15:08.860
I just want sleep.

15:13.820 --> 15:15.343
- Can I help you?
- No.

15:17.140 --> 15:19.123
Yes, actually.

15:26.750 --> 15:27.581
One moment.

15:29.520 --> 15:30.353
Do you mind?

15:31.962 --> 15:33.281
- Yeah.
- Oh, oh, oh.

15:33.283 --> 15:34.116
Mm-hmm.

15:39.323 --> 15:41.248
What the hell were you doing in my room?

15:41.250 --> 15:42.668
Well, look, I swear,

15:42.670 --> 15:45.102
I didn't even know that you were in there.

15:45.104 --> 15:47.168
He dropped his room key.

15:47.170 --> 15:49.148
Yeah, yeah, you should
totally have it back up.

15:49.150 --> 15:50.970
I'm sorry about that.

15:52.510 --> 15:55.128
I saw him walking around
with dirt and stuff in there

15:55.130 --> 15:57.708
and he never really talks to anyone.

15:57.710 --> 16:00.538
I thought that I saw him carry
a dead body into his car,

16:00.540 --> 16:03.418
and I don't know, just the
whole thing looked really shady.

16:03.420 --> 16:04.698
Shady?

16:04.700 --> 16:06.953
Yeah, like maybe he's
a killer or something.

16:08.150 --> 16:09.518
My brother?

16:09.520 --> 16:11.188
Yeah, I don't know.

16:11.190 --> 16:12.023
He's not.

16:13.150 --> 16:16.808
Okay, well, that's cool, I guess.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.193
I just wasn't feeling good,

16:20.480 --> 16:22.603
and the dirt's for the bath, obviously.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.817
It's not that strange.

16:25.819 --> 16:30.618
Oh, no, no, I've heard of
people take mud baths and stuff

16:30.620 --> 16:32.818
because it's supposed to be
good for your skin and stuff,

16:32.820 --> 16:35.978
but I've just never really done that.

16:35.980 --> 16:38.173
Yeah, I always shower.

16:39.270 --> 16:40.103
Not always.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.488
I don't shower all the time.

16:42.490 --> 16:44.778
I don't have some sort
of a weird odor problem

16:44.780 --> 16:45.880
or anything like that.

16:46.719 --> 16:49.018
I'm a clean person.

16:49.020 --> 16:50.453
I shower the normal amount.

16:52.310 --> 16:55.428
Gotcha, well, look,
whatever your name is,

16:55.430 --> 16:57.698
don't come into my room again, got it?

16:57.700 --> 16:58.913
Yeah, of course.

17:03.470 --> 17:04.303
Noah.

17:05.819 --> 17:06.948
What?

17:06.950 --> 17:08.063
I'm Noah.

17:09.150 --> 17:11.203
Yeah, I just thought you should know.

17:13.097 --> 17:13.930
Zooey.

17:14.800 --> 17:15.700
Nice to meet ya.

17:27.910 --> 17:28.743
What?

17:31.480 --> 17:32.573
Who was that?

17:32.575 --> 17:33.408
Nobody.

17:34.710 --> 17:36.558
Does nobody have a name?

17:36.560 --> 17:38.688
- Just forget it.
- All right, fine.

17:38.690 --> 17:40.348
If you don't wanna share.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.748
I just walked into the
wrong room, that's all.

17:42.750 --> 17:44.918
It's a motel.

17:44.920 --> 17:47.408
- There's numbers on the door.
- Yeah, just drop the subject.

17:47.410 --> 17:50.403
I'm off, I'm off.

17:56.790 --> 17:58.168
She was cute.

17:58.170 --> 17:59.434
Shut up.

18:21.845 --> 18:25.393
Oh, sorry, I didn't
know anyone was in here.

18:26.360 --> 18:29.173
No, no, it's fine, really, totally.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.243
It's fine.

18:59.650 --> 19:02.263
So you planning on swimming?

19:03.210 --> 19:04.358
What?

19:04.360 --> 19:05.623
Oh, no.

19:06.819 --> 19:10.413
Oh, I get it, you
don't know how to swim.

19:14.960 --> 19:18.318
Oh my God, you actually
don't know how to swim.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.373
It's fine.

19:22.570 --> 19:23.573
Nobody taught me.

19:29.660 --> 19:30.777
How about you?

19:31.670 --> 19:33.288
Well, I wouldn't come to the pool

19:33.290 --> 19:34.740
if I didn't know how to swim.

19:36.110 --> 19:36.943
I did.

20:08.782 --> 20:09.615
Ah, okay,

20:17.558 --> 20:19.975
I'm just gonna have to go in.

20:21.135 --> 20:22.802
I can do this, okay.

20:28.890 --> 20:31.338
Oh, God, I'm sorry,

20:31.340 --> 20:34.233
it just looked like you were
maybe drowning or something.

20:35.298 --> 20:36.129
I don't know.

20:36.131 --> 20:37.783
You were just under there
for a very long time.

20:41.150 --> 20:44.148
Were you gonna jump in?

20:44.150 --> 20:45.470
- Well, I was...
- Zooey.

21:10.480 --> 21:11.730
What were you thinking?

21:13.350 --> 21:16.278
You can't just run off like that.

21:16.280 --> 21:17.858
I didn't run off.

21:17.860 --> 21:18.988
I went to go swim.

21:18.990 --> 21:21.508
I don't care where you went.

21:21.510 --> 21:22.860
What if something happened?

21:23.980 --> 21:25.298
You're being paranoid.

21:25.300 --> 21:27.198
I'm being cautious, Zooey.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.608
Do you want to spend the
rest of your time in a place

21:29.610 --> 21:31.608
that doesn't understand you?

21:31.610 --> 21:33.723
A place that'll hurt you until it does?

21:35.240 --> 21:36.468
No.

21:36.470 --> 21:37.558
Because that's what's going to happen

21:37.560 --> 21:40.293
if somebody finds out.

21:50.920 --> 21:52.583
I'm just trying to keep you safe.

21:55.730 --> 21:58.420
If anything were to happen to you, I...

22:01.760 --> 22:03.493
Just please?

22:05.111 --> 22:06.611
You don't have much more time.

22:08.760 --> 22:09.593
I'm sorry.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.023
I know.

22:17.990 --> 22:19.263
Who was that out there?

22:22.090 --> 22:22.923
Just some kid.

22:26.359 --> 22:27.192
Okay.

22:34.167 --> 22:39.073
What are you doing?

22:41.791 --> 22:42.624
Nothing.

22:45.340 --> 22:46.340
You're weird, kid.

22:47.410 --> 22:50.527
Don't go in there for awhile.

23:21.357 --> 23:22.857
Extraterrestrials.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.360
Can't sleep, huh?

24:18.290 --> 24:19.788
Milkshake time, let's go.

24:19.790 --> 24:21.008
What time?

24:21.010 --> 24:23.197
You heard me, it's milkshake time.

24:23.199 --> 24:24.032
Go, let's go.

24:28.050 --> 24:28.881
Come on.

24:37.410 --> 24:39.143
Ow, brain freeze.

24:43.120 --> 24:44.503
Oh, I love milkshakes.

24:47.860 --> 24:48.693
So?

24:50.560 --> 24:52.048
What?

24:52.050 --> 24:52.923
That girl.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.418
- Zooey?
- Bingo.

24:56.420 --> 24:58.206
She has a name.

24:58.208 --> 24:59.041
Shut up.

24:59.919 --> 25:04.048
Oh, man, so how's she doing?

25:04.050 --> 25:07.058
- Fine.
- Oh, you think she's fine?

25:07.060 --> 25:08.553
That is not what I said.

25:08.555 --> 25:12.823
Oh, man,

25:14.240 --> 25:17.998
to be young again, chasing girls around.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.600
You did a lot of girl chasing?

25:21.030 --> 25:21.863
Nope.

25:22.800 --> 25:23.823
Just aliens then?

25:26.840 --> 25:31.840
Yo, wait, is that...?

25:33.170 --> 25:34.113
Yo, what is that?

25:35.420 --> 25:37.598
That's a freaking UFO.

25:37.600 --> 25:38.738
That's a goddamn...

25:38.740 --> 25:42.623
Wait, my bad, that's a plane.

25:45.580 --> 25:49.883
Anyway, I'm happy for you, kid, truly.

25:53.843 --> 25:56.313
You should ask her out.

26:02.512 --> 26:07.262
Oh, man, I don't know about you,

26:08.101 --> 26:10.633
but all this sugar's making me tired.

26:12.270 --> 26:13.103
Ready to go?

26:14.516 --> 26:17.185
Let's do it.

26:17.187 --> 26:20.848
Yes, dear, what is it?

26:20.850 --> 26:25.300
When I came to your
place, it was because of...

26:26.150 --> 26:27.150
Yes?

26:28.230 --> 26:30.357
I just arrived here.

26:30.359 --> 26:31.988
I did not know where else to go,

26:31.990 --> 26:35.483
but everything was so strange to me.

26:37.740 --> 26:42.580
I'm glad you came, so is grandpa.

26:43.533 --> 26:45.543
Gotta meet family and friends.

27:16.457 --> 27:17.336
Hey.

27:17.338 --> 27:18.171
Hey.

27:19.590 --> 27:21.313
So what's up?

27:22.470 --> 27:23.301
Nothing.

27:25.690 --> 27:28.173
Okay, guess I'll see you later then.

27:29.130 --> 27:29.961
Oh, wait, wait,

27:29.963 --> 27:31.498
I came over here to ask you

27:31.500 --> 27:36.083
if you wanted to go see
something or go do something?

27:37.170 --> 27:40.163
Go out to do something with me?

27:42.270 --> 27:43.623
Yeah, sure.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.558
Yeah?

27:46.560 --> 27:47.393
Yeah.

27:48.826 --> 27:49.659
Yeah?

27:50.618 --> 27:52.234
Mm-hmm.

27:52.236 --> 27:53.819
Yeah, okay, cool.

27:56.960 --> 28:01.960
I'll just go and find with
something for us to do.

28:02.920 --> 28:04.633
I'll get back to you.

28:05.890 --> 28:06.723
Sounds good.

28:08.660 --> 28:09.493
For awesome.

28:15.620 --> 28:16.523
For awesome?

28:23.092 --> 28:25.057
For awesome.

31:20.270 --> 31:21.103
Mind if I sit?

31:22.380 --> 31:23.213
Plenty of room.

32:05.688 --> 32:07.618
You live next door, right?

32:07.620 --> 32:08.453
Taylor?

32:09.930 --> 32:10.763
Yeah.

32:14.130 --> 32:14.963
Owen.

32:22.738 --> 32:24.405
Want a beer, Owen?

32:25.870 --> 32:27.663
Yeah, yeah.

32:59.360 --> 33:01.383
- So...
- They can't be together.

33:06.503 --> 33:10.328
Zooey doesn't have time
to be playing around

33:10.330 --> 33:11.893
with your little Noah.

33:15.280 --> 33:16.448
What do you mean?

33:16.450 --> 33:18.188
They're pretty good together.

33:18.190 --> 33:19.723
Yeah, that's the problem.

33:23.040 --> 33:25.113
It's not gonna work, it can't work,

33:26.400 --> 33:29.250
so there's no point in them both

33:30.250 --> 33:31.650
getting their feelings hurt.

33:38.820 --> 33:41.333
But isn't that just a process though?

33:42.550 --> 33:43.381
They're young.

33:43.383 --> 33:45.810
It's not like they're going
to be together forever.

33:53.350 --> 33:54.183
What's going on?

33:55.850 --> 33:56.683
I'm sorry.

33:59.900 --> 34:00.848
You're fine.

34:00.850 --> 34:01.683
No, it's okay.

34:05.428 --> 34:06.843
Zooey's got a condition

34:09.940 --> 34:14.503
and we don't have much longer,

34:15.880 --> 34:18.713
so we just drove,

34:25.670 --> 34:28.918
figured we'd see the country.

34:28.920 --> 34:31.078
I'd never been further
west than Wisconsin,

34:31.080 --> 34:34.003
so you know what's in Wisconsin?

34:35.900 --> 34:36.733
Cheese?

34:37.920 --> 34:40.253
Yeah, yeah, and nothing else.

34:43.960 --> 34:46.060
- So you're just gonna...
- Just gonna go.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.822
We figured we'd just really go.

34:57.270 --> 34:59.520
This can't be the
final destination though.

35:00.560 --> 35:04.203
No, no, it is nice though.

35:24.510 --> 35:25.343
Yeah?

35:27.160 --> 35:27.993
She picked it.

35:33.610 --> 35:34.560
That'll be great.

35:54.300 --> 35:58.413
So how long's she have left?

35:59.870 --> 36:04.411
I don't know, I don't know,

36:04.413 --> 36:07.883
a couple of weeks or less.

36:09.880 --> 36:10.933
You can finish the beer.

36:32.290 --> 36:34.140
Okay, I want to show you something,

36:35.010 --> 36:37.857
but you have to promise
not to scream or anything?

36:37.859 --> 36:38.798
What?

36:38.800 --> 36:39.631
Promise.

36:39.633 --> 36:41.783
Okay, I promise.

36:52.850 --> 36:57.220
Oh, hey, that's...

37:03.580 --> 37:04.413
You're a...

37:06.300 --> 37:07.999
What are you?

37:08.001 --> 37:11.408
I'm not from here.

37:11.410 --> 37:12.818
Does anybody else know?

37:12.820 --> 37:13.720
Just my brother.

37:14.820 --> 37:16.468
This is amazing.

37:16.470 --> 37:18.348
Can you do that tongue thing again?

37:18.350 --> 37:19.181
What?

37:19.183 --> 37:20.016
No.

37:22.770 --> 37:26.128
This is crazy, crazy.

37:26.130 --> 37:28.478
My girlfriend is an alien.

37:28.480 --> 37:32.593
Hang on, girlfriend?

37:33.740 --> 37:35.228
Did I say girlfriend?

37:35.230 --> 37:36.438
No, no.

37:36.440 --> 37:37.514
What I meant to say was...

37:37.516 --> 37:41.078
No, no, I like it.

37:41.080 --> 37:42.573
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:43.830 --> 37:46.573
It just seems right.

37:50.420 --> 37:52.438
I have so many questions.

37:52.440 --> 37:53.390
Where are you from?

37:54.690 --> 37:56.398
I don't know.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.348
Oh, and the mud baths.

37:58.350 --> 38:00.972
Is that how you feed or something?

38:00.974 --> 38:02.288
No.

38:02.290 --> 38:03.468
Can you breathe under water?

38:03.470 --> 38:04.878
Oh, oh, oh, can you fly

38:04.880 --> 38:07.030
or do you have super
strength or something?

38:16.720 --> 38:18.943
Wow.

38:31.000 --> 38:36.000
So out of all the places,

38:38.200 --> 38:40.273
why in a motel?

38:45.420 --> 38:50.140
Before I was adopted by Richard,

38:54.150 --> 38:55.463
he found me here.

38:57.860 --> 39:01.683
I guess my parents just
left me there on the steps.

39:04.120 --> 39:05.703
I don't know, dude.

39:07.600 --> 39:11.773
I just feel like I've
always felt at home here,

39:13.240 --> 39:15.123
more than any other place anyway.

39:17.380 --> 39:19.080
I didn't know my parents either.

39:21.680 --> 39:23.168
I always thought,

39:23.170 --> 39:26.483
out of all the places they
could've left me in the galaxy,

39:28.380 --> 39:29.223
they chose here.

39:34.510 --> 39:37.313
Your brother, is he...?

39:39.100 --> 39:43.203
No, he just found me,

39:45.010 --> 39:45.903
saved me.

39:48.806 --> 39:51.670
He never told anyone what I was.

39:54.900 --> 39:57.493
He always protected me.

39:59.740 --> 40:01.213
What about your parents?

40:02.420 --> 40:05.383
Do you think they'll ever come back?

40:11.920 --> 40:14.121
It doesn't matter anymore.

40:14.123 --> 40:15.223
It doesn't matter?

40:16.400 --> 40:17.850
What's that supposed to mean?

40:19.840 --> 40:23.173
I just don't care.

40:25.020 --> 40:29.403
Do you think your parents
are out there somewhere?

40:31.500 --> 40:32.750
I don't know.

40:34.670 --> 40:35.503
Maybe.

40:39.210 --> 40:40.043
Maybe not.

40:41.430 --> 40:44.963
Well, I'm glad now that
my parents left me here.

40:47.520 --> 40:48.353
I'm happy.

41:21.038 --> 41:22.371
Mm, whoa, man.

41:26.280 --> 41:27.141
Why you so smiley?

41:27.143 --> 41:30.338
We live about 20 steps
from her door to mine.

41:30.340 --> 41:31.440
I think I'm in love.

41:35.010 --> 41:38.828
Whoa, hold up, love?

41:38.830 --> 41:40.828
Like love love?

41:40.830 --> 41:42.378
Yeah.

41:42.380 --> 41:43.213
Shit,

41:50.500 --> 41:51.333
what's it like?

41:53.705 --> 41:55.478
It's really weird.

41:55.480 --> 41:58.248
Yeah, well, considering
the circumstances.

41:58.250 --> 42:01.289
I just don't even know
what to do with my life.

42:02.400 --> 42:03.468
What?

42:03.470 --> 42:04.301
- What's so funny?
- You don't know what to do

42:04.303 --> 42:06.048
with your life.

42:06.050 --> 42:08.688
Kid, I'm 30 years old,
living out of a motel,

42:08.690 --> 42:11.378
using an empty chip bag
as a damn trashcan liner,

42:11.380 --> 42:12.671
not to mention the only socializing I do

42:12.673 --> 42:14.828
is with a 14 year old.

42:14.830 --> 42:17.198
And whose fault is that?

42:17.200 --> 42:19.158
Entirely mine.

42:19.160 --> 42:22.813
No, wait, so tell me what happened.

42:25.360 --> 42:26.697
Oh, that's what you're going...

42:26.699 --> 42:27.530
You're not going to tell me?

42:27.532 --> 42:28.363
You're just going to...

42:28.365 --> 42:29.348
Okay, okay, all right, fine.

42:29.350 --> 42:30.181
No donuts for you.

42:30.183 --> 42:31.016
Get out of here.

42:55.690 --> 42:58.098
I can see why you like this stuff.

42:58.100 --> 42:59.608
It's so...

42:59.610 --> 43:00.688
Sugary?

43:00.690 --> 43:02.338
Yeah.

43:02.340 --> 43:04.568
Here, have one of these.

43:04.570 --> 43:07.423
It's always been one of my favorites.

43:16.150 --> 43:17.540
Your eyes...

43:20.180 --> 43:22.918
I've just never seen them like that.

43:22.920 --> 43:26.028
Yeah, they do that sometimes.

43:26.030 --> 43:30.463
No, it's beautiful.

43:35.390 --> 43:37.690
I can't believe you've
never had any of these.

43:39.030 --> 43:41.498
Yeah, my brother
doesn't really allow it.

43:41.500 --> 43:42.333
That sucks.

43:43.657 --> 43:46.408
One time, Owen and I got a huge
bucket full of these things

43:46.410 --> 43:48.323
and we downed it in 15 minutes.

43:49.570 --> 43:50.868
Owen?

43:50.870 --> 43:52.928
Yeah, the guy I live with.

43:52.930 --> 43:53.880
Oh, your brother.

43:57.050 --> 43:57.923
Not exactly.

43:59.070 --> 44:02.803
He's like family.

44:03.970 --> 44:04.887
Like family?

44:08.740 --> 44:12.693
Is, I guess, is family.

44:17.190 --> 44:19.123
Here, try one of these.

44:20.460 --> 44:22.363
I do have to warn you though,

44:23.630 --> 44:27.352
they tend to get a little bit...

44:28.560 --> 44:29.393
Oh, no.

44:31.170 --> 44:32.568
Sour.

44:32.570 --> 44:33.401
Noah.

44:33.403 --> 44:34.780
Sorry, Owen.

44:34.782 --> 44:38.328
Boy, you and that girl,
you're lucky, mm-hmm,

44:38.330 --> 44:41.013
but you not sleeping
here tonight, go on home.

44:53.630 --> 44:55.423
So what's going on?

44:56.750 --> 44:57.583
Here.

44:58.658 --> 45:00.568
Zooey, what are you doing with those?

45:00.570 --> 45:02.738
Aren't you a little curious?

45:02.740 --> 45:04.268
About what?

45:04.270 --> 45:05.483
To try it, dummy.

45:06.430 --> 45:07.263
No.

45:08.950 --> 45:13.371
Okay, fine, it doesn't smell too bad.

45:13.373 --> 45:16.468
What if you're allergic
to it or something?

45:16.470 --> 45:18.848
I don't have any problems with gluten.

45:18.850 --> 45:20.098
That's not what I'm talking about.

45:20.100 --> 45:23.468
It's fine, Noah, here, try some.

45:23.470 --> 45:24.303
No.

45:25.418 --> 45:28.513
Fine, you're going to
make me drink alone then.

45:29.870 --> 45:32.248
Oh, nice, peer pressure now.

45:32.250 --> 45:33.681
Suit yourself.

45:40.520 --> 45:41.920
Why do we adults drink that?

45:43.130 --> 45:44.763
I honestly don't know.

45:45.890 --> 45:47.298
You can finish it.

45:47.300 --> 45:48.131
After all that,

45:48.133 --> 45:50.297
you honestly think that
I'm going to want some?

45:51.750 --> 45:53.668
Let's go do something else.

45:53.670 --> 45:54.813
Oh my God.

46:35.491 --> 46:38.123
Owen, hey, what's going on?

46:42.323 --> 46:45.510
I think I might have something for you.

46:45.512 --> 46:47.679
Okay, let's have a look.

46:52.720 --> 46:54.423
Oh, wow,

46:57.030 --> 46:59.980
I haven't seen one of these
come in here for quite a while.

47:00.916 --> 47:03.217
Where'd you get it?

47:03.219 --> 47:04.669
I had it since I was a kid.

47:06.189 --> 47:07.289
It was my first comic.

47:12.911 --> 47:13.828
You sure?

47:15.520 --> 47:17.048
You sure you want to sell?

47:17.050 --> 47:17.883
I do.

47:19.410 --> 47:20.243
Yeah.

47:23.960 --> 47:28.268
Okay, well, the last
one we had come in here

47:28.270 --> 47:30.070
was pretty beat up, let me tell you.

47:31.150 --> 47:33.693
Still, it went for quite a bit,

47:35.710 --> 47:40.710
but since this one's
mint, or basically mint,

47:43.540 --> 47:44.790
probably looking at...

47:53.660 --> 47:56.148
- Bull shit.
- No, sir.

47:56.150 --> 47:58.113
What?

47:59.060 --> 48:01.878
I know a guy who would
buy this in a heartbeat.

48:01.880 --> 48:02.713
Who?

48:03.810 --> 48:05.818
- Me.
- Really?

48:05.820 --> 48:08.965
You say the word, I'll get
my cheque book right now.

48:08.967 --> 48:13.967
You promise to
take good care of it, yeah?

48:15.817 --> 48:16.817
Of course.

48:25.096 --> 48:27.263
Let me get my cheque book.

49:31.172 --> 49:32.005
Zooey.

49:39.340 --> 49:41.340
It's okay, just breathe.

49:43.787 --> 49:45.287
Hey, just breathe.

49:48.844 --> 49:50.344
You're doing okay.

49:54.937 --> 49:56.187
You'll be okay.

49:59.655 --> 50:01.905
Keep breathing, okay, okay.

50:24.133 --> 50:25.657
Zooey's busy right now.

50:27.026 --> 50:28.295
Yeah, okay, I was just...

50:46.484 --> 50:50.073
,
my sisters are calling.

50:51.180 --> 50:52.693
Wake up, wake up now.

50:54.960 --> 50:57.063
Our sisters are awake.

50:57.065 --> 50:58.518
They're hungry.

50:58.520 --> 51:00.460
They've slept it off.

51:00.462 --> 51:02.879
It's time to go into the sea.

51:32.911 --> 51:33.742
Zooey?

51:54.974 --> 51:56.391
Where you been?

52:00.380 --> 52:03.630
Are you just gonna ignore me like that?

52:33.600 --> 52:35.628
I didn't even know you were coming.

52:35.630 --> 52:36.463
Yeah.

52:38.830 --> 52:41.018
Do you want to go somewhere?

52:41.020 --> 52:43.143
Can we just sit and talk?

52:44.890 --> 52:45.793
Yeah, sure.

52:55.750 --> 52:57.328
I came over and knocked earlier...

52:57.330 --> 52:58.163
I know.

52:59.840 --> 53:02.428
He just seemed pretty upset with me.

53:02.430 --> 53:03.918
It's not you.

53:03.920 --> 53:04.888
Really?

53:04.890 --> 53:07.793
Sometimes he just gets like that.

53:09.670 --> 53:10.743
Like what?

53:13.740 --> 53:17.753
Stressed out, mad or something,

53:18.920 --> 53:20.848
usually because of me.

53:20.850 --> 53:22.950
I'm sure it's not always because of you.

53:24.150 --> 53:25.450
You're just saying that.

53:26.880 --> 53:28.893
No, I'm really not.

53:31.760 --> 53:33.753
Look, Noah,

53:36.364 --> 53:38.293
I don't think we should see each other.

53:40.270 --> 53:43.358
What, you don't think...?

53:43.360 --> 53:44.193
Why not?

53:46.560 --> 53:49.593
We can't hang out, not anymore.

53:52.990 --> 53:54.268
Is it Taylor?

53:54.270 --> 53:56.143
No, it's not my brother.

54:02.690 --> 54:03.628
What did I do?

54:03.630 --> 54:04.880
You didn't do anything.

54:07.920 --> 54:12.523
It's just because it's what I want.

54:15.210 --> 54:17.128
I don't understand.

54:17.130 --> 54:18.430
It's what's best for me.

54:22.247 --> 54:23.080
Okay.

54:53.830 --> 54:57.063
New, bold, daring, I hate it.

55:00.500 --> 55:01.400
Yo, you all right?

55:08.410 --> 55:09.253
Talk to me, kid.

55:11.910 --> 55:14.458
Zooey doesn't want to see me anymore.

55:14.460 --> 55:15.510
Why? What happened?

55:17.380 --> 55:18.263
I don't know.

55:19.200 --> 55:21.475
I guess I'm just not good enough.

55:21.477 --> 55:24.088
Oh, what the hell are you talking about?

55:24.090 --> 55:25.493
She's just so special.

55:26.830 --> 55:27.758
I'm just me.

55:27.760 --> 55:28.683
No way.

55:29.930 --> 55:31.203
I should have known.

55:32.130 --> 55:34.738
Why would anyone like her
wanna be with someone like me?

55:34.740 --> 55:36.440
Hey, what are you talking about?

55:39.400 --> 55:40.458
He's right.

55:40.460 --> 55:41.343
Who's right?

55:42.200 --> 55:43.031
- Richard.
- Oh, no, no.

55:43.033 --> 55:44.758
- He's always been right.
- Hold on.

55:44.760 --> 55:46.758
I'm just a piece of shit.

55:46.760 --> 55:48.278
Hold on.

55:48.280 --> 55:49.823
- It's all I am.
- No, hey,

55:51.525 --> 55:52.442
look at me.

55:53.768 --> 55:55.268
I know you're not about to believe a word

55:55.270 --> 55:57.220
that comes out of that asshole's mouth.

56:00.130 --> 56:01.348
He's right.

56:01.350 --> 56:03.463
No, he's wrong, Noah.

56:05.040 --> 56:06.108
When he says stuff like that,

56:06.110 --> 56:08.368
that has nothing to do with you.

56:08.370 --> 56:10.853
It has everything to do with him.

56:11.734 --> 56:13.573
Since when are you the expert?

56:14.440 --> 56:16.643
Trust me, I know.

56:20.390 --> 56:21.883
My parents were the same way.

56:25.550 --> 56:29.433
As hard as it may seem, we
just can't believe that shit.

56:30.940 --> 56:35.218
You gotta focus on you
and what makes you great,

56:35.220 --> 56:36.923
because you are great.

56:38.950 --> 56:39.783
Cool?

56:49.540 --> 56:50.373
What?

56:54.061 --> 56:55.728
It's not that weird.

56:57.706 --> 56:59.289
It is that weird.

57:01.610 --> 57:02.653
A little, yeah.

57:04.420 --> 57:07.763
Point is, Richard's a loser.

57:08.880 --> 57:10.080
You're nothing like him.

57:12.240 --> 57:13.073
Who?

57:14.190 --> 57:15.023
My man.

57:17.010 --> 57:17.841
What?

57:17.843 --> 57:19.408
Get away from me with all that, dude.

57:19.410 --> 57:20.938
My mustache?

57:20.940 --> 57:22.638
Yeah, shave it off and
then you can come back.

57:22.640 --> 57:24.006
God, come give me a hug, man, at least.

57:24.008 --> 57:25.558
- Stop.
- Show your boy some love.

57:25.560 --> 57:26.709
- Stop.
- Oh.

57:36.430 --> 57:39.708
I knew it, God damn it.

57:39.710 --> 57:41.048
I knew you were staying
at that guy's house.

57:41.050 --> 57:42.379
His name's Owen.

57:42.381 --> 57:44.168
I don't give a shit what his name is.

57:44.170 --> 57:45.348
Do you know how long you've been gone?

57:45.350 --> 57:46.288
You tell me, asshole.

57:46.290 --> 57:47.338
Hey, watch your mouth.

57:47.340 --> 57:48.408
It's been weeks.

57:48.410 --> 57:49.360
What do you care?

57:50.260 --> 57:51.488
Excuse me?

57:51.490 --> 57:53.633
You've never given a shit about me.

57:55.561 --> 57:56.711
Say the same for you.

57:57.852 --> 58:00.018
- Come on, let's go.
- Ow, Owen.

58:00.020 --> 58:00.970
- Shut up.
- Owen.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.868
Hey, Noah, we've
got some more deliveries.

58:10.870 --> 58:11.828
Where you at, man?

58:11.830 --> 58:13.728
Give me a call back as soon as you can.

58:13.730 --> 58:14.563
All right, bye.

58:16.920 --> 58:19.388
Noah, you are way late, man.

58:19.390 --> 58:22.178
Okay, are you with Zooey again?

58:22.180 --> 58:23.158
Give me a call.

58:23.160 --> 58:24.053
All right, bye.

58:26.490 --> 58:28.723
Yo, it's Owen.

58:30.560 --> 58:31.823
I found your bike, man.

58:33.005 --> 58:35.838
Did Taylor give you two a ride somewhere?

58:35.840 --> 58:36.673
Give me a call.

58:39.390 --> 58:42.563
Noah, Zooey's here.

58:43.670 --> 58:44.825
What's going on?

58:47.160 --> 58:49.896
I'm coming, kid, just hang on.

1:00:11.320 --> 1:00:12.958
What do you want?

1:00:12.960 --> 1:00:14.560
To break you out of here, kid.

1:00:29.900 --> 1:00:32.298
Come on, let's get you out of here.

1:00:32.300 --> 1:00:33.138
What about Richard?

1:00:33.140 --> 1:00:35.263
Oh, I think he's preoccupied.

1:00:38.970 --> 1:00:43.723
Hey, oh, sorry.

1:00:46.740 --> 1:00:47.573
Come on.

1:00:49.940 --> 1:00:51.292
What's the point?

1:00:51.294 --> 1:00:53.266
What do you mean?

1:00:53.268 --> 1:00:55.318
He's just going to keep on coming back.

1:00:57.375 --> 1:00:58.708
I'm not even getting any sleep,

1:00:58.710 --> 1:01:00.118
just worrying about the next time he...

1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:01.103
He hits you?

1:01:07.500 --> 1:01:08.331
We're going to call

1:01:08.333 --> 1:01:09.808
Child Protective Services or something.

1:01:09.810 --> 1:01:12.448
I don't wanna cause anymore problems.

1:01:12.450 --> 1:01:13.281
Problem?

1:01:13.283 --> 1:01:17.283
No, no, no, you're not
causing the problem, he is.

1:01:18.540 --> 1:01:19.907
Please, don't.

1:01:28.727 --> 1:01:31.894
Okay, I think I know we're gonna do.

1:01:35.250 --> 1:01:36.200
What do you mean?

1:01:38.523 --> 1:01:43.523
I've got an idea, but
I need you to watch.

1:01:44.713 --> 1:01:45.663
What's your idea?

1:01:49.630 --> 1:01:52.168
- I'm gonna fight him.
- What?

1:01:52.170 --> 1:01:54.578
Yeah, come on, let's go quickly,

1:01:54.580 --> 1:01:56.513
before I realize how stupid this is.

1:01:57.444 --> 1:01:58.527
Wait, okay.

1:02:25.793 --> 1:02:27.376
Eye of the tiger.

1:02:31.160 --> 1:02:32.233
- Hey.
- What?

1:02:34.861 --> 1:02:36.913
What the hell are you doing in my house?

1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:39.448
I'm taking Noah with me.

1:02:39.450 --> 1:02:40.427
Like hell you are.

1:02:40.429 --> 1:02:42.228
You heard me.

1:02:42.230 --> 1:02:43.698
You think I'm just gonna let you go?

1:02:43.700 --> 1:02:45.171
Yeah.

1:02:45.173 --> 1:02:46.123
Are you an idiot?

1:02:47.380 --> 1:02:48.598
Probably.

1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:52.628
So let me get this straight,
you come into my house,

1:02:52.630 --> 1:02:54.045
you try to take my kid

1:02:54.047 --> 1:02:56.942
and you think I'm just gonna
let you walk out the door?

1:02:56.944 --> 1:02:58.544
Why don't you try and stop me?

1:03:15.377 --> 1:03:16.960
Go, go, go, go, go.

1:03:21.716 --> 1:03:23.108
Oh, shit, oh, go, go, go, go, go.

1:03:23.110 --> 1:03:26.530
There's the car, there's
the car right there.

1:03:27.509 --> 1:03:29.264
Where's my keys?

1:03:42.150 --> 1:03:44.245
Why'd you make me watch that?

1:03:44.247 --> 1:03:45.297
I needed a witness.

1:03:52.360 --> 1:03:53.693
Now I need a payphone.

1:04:05.038 --> 1:04:06.922
911.

1:04:37.018 --> 1:04:39.298
What a day, huh?

1:04:39.300 --> 1:04:40.133
Yeah.

1:04:43.811 --> 1:04:46.328
I never thought

1:04:46.330 --> 1:04:48.728
I'd get my first black eye this way.

1:04:48.730 --> 1:04:50.288
First?

1:04:50.290 --> 1:04:51.123
Yeah.

1:04:52.015 --> 1:04:53.468
It doesn't surprise me.

1:04:53.470 --> 1:04:54.420
What do you mean?

1:04:55.820 --> 1:04:58.213
I wouldn't want to be the
guy who gets hit by you.

1:05:07.450 --> 1:05:08.283
Hey,

1:05:11.790 --> 1:05:16.790
I'm thinking about buying
some land out in the valley.

1:05:21.697 --> 1:05:26.138
Either you can help me get it started...

1:05:26.140 --> 1:05:27.700
Do you want me to work
for you or something?

1:05:27.702 --> 1:05:28.785
No, no, no,

1:05:32.830 --> 1:05:37.473
you could come help do some chores.

1:05:42.530 --> 1:05:43.889
You're asking me to move in with you?

1:05:43.891 --> 1:05:46.383
No, what, you crazy?

1:05:51.660 --> 1:05:55.793
Yeah, I am actually.

1:05:58.020 --> 1:05:58.853
Yeah.

1:06:03.105 --> 1:06:03.938
Okay,

1:06:08.600 --> 1:06:10.758
but no talking during my alien movies.

1:06:10.760 --> 1:06:12.998
You and those damn movies, dude.

1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:14.700
You'll grow to love them, watch.

1:06:16.058 --> 1:06:16.946
Is that so?

1:06:16.948 --> 1:06:19.281
Mm-hmm, just give it time.

1:06:23.348 --> 1:06:24.181
You okay?

1:06:25.888 --> 1:06:26.721
Yeah.

1:06:27.978 --> 1:06:28.811
Sure?

1:06:30.894 --> 1:06:31.977
I think so.

1:07:27.204 --> 1:07:28.500
Let's go.

1:07:28.502 --> 1:07:30.518
What time is it?

1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:31.458
It doesn't matter.

1:07:31.460 --> 1:07:32.588
Let's go.

1:07:32.590 --> 1:07:33.423
Why?

1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:37.278
Wake up.

1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:38.111
Through the window?

1:08:36.304 --> 1:08:38.493
This summer with you,

1:08:41.420 --> 1:08:42.733
it's been awesome.

1:08:44.340 --> 1:08:45.490
For awesome.

1:09:04.979 --> 1:09:07.317
So I'll see you tomorrow?

1:09:07.319 --> 1:09:08.208
Yeah.

1:09:08.210 --> 1:09:09.042
See ya.

1:09:11.490 --> 1:09:12.323
Bye, Noah.

1:09:29.550 --> 1:09:31.300
No, no, no, no, no.

1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:30.938
Dear,
Noah, I wasn't really sure

1:10:30.940 --> 1:10:32.608
what to put down here,

1:10:32.610 --> 1:10:34.858
but I knew that I had to say something,

1:10:34.860 --> 1:10:36.362
even if I couldn't directly.

1:10:38.889 --> 1:10:43.889
Goodbyes have never been hard
for me, but this one hurts,

1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:46.850
and I hope that you
won't hold it against me.

1:10:52.290 --> 1:10:54.198
When Taylor and I came out here,

1:10:54.200 --> 1:10:56.300
I didn't think I'd end up meeting anybody,

1:10:57.280 --> 1:10:59.930
and there was this stupid
boy who broke into my room.

1:11:08.889 --> 1:11:11.508
Well, that's everything.

1:11:11.510 --> 1:11:12.341
All right.

1:11:12.343 --> 1:11:13.658
Being
with you has made my time here

1:11:13.660 --> 1:11:15.702
really, really special,

1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:21.263
but it also makes what's about
to happen so much harder,

1:11:22.100 --> 1:11:25.618
because I think that, in some kind of way,

1:11:25.620 --> 1:11:28.112
I feel like maybe I love you.

1:11:42.670 --> 1:11:45.670
Maybe in a while, you and Owen
could check on Taylor for me.

1:11:46.650 --> 1:11:48.038
Give him some time,

1:11:48.040 --> 1:11:50.378
but I know he'll need somebody to talk to,

1:11:50.380 --> 1:11:52.023
somebody that really knows.

1:12:25.191 --> 1:12:27.608
Goodbye, Noah, and thank you.

1:12:29.566 --> 1:12:30.648
Yours, Zooey.
