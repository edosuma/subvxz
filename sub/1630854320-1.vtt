- (Frantic background speech)

01:26.232 --> 01:28.711
(Dramatic music)

01:37.467 --> 01:40.066
(Basem) Hakim, we'll need
to distribute the guns tomorrow,

01:40.146 --> 01:42.264
and guard them for now.

01:42.344 --> 01:44.943
(Heavy patter of rain)

01:48.261 --> 01:50.021
Marco, Medhi, you're staying.

01:50.101 --> 01:52.899
Basem will call you first thing.

01:52.979 --> 01:55.778
I'll stay too. Not a problem.

01:57.137 --> 01:59.536
(Truck doors slam shut)

02:01.415 --> 02:03.574

02:23.044 --> 02:25.043

Do it like Uncle Basem. Go on.

02:25.123 --> 02:27.682
Let's go.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.120
Cheers.

02:32.199 --> 02:34.718
(Algerian music playing
in the background)

02:37.437 --> 02:38.796
Whoa!

02:38.876 --> 02:40.515
(Chuckling)

02:40.595 --> 02:42.154
The fuck are you doing?

02:42.234 --> 02:44.313
Check this.

02:47.592 --> 02:49.671
You putting it back together?

02:49.751 --> 02:51.750
No? Don't think so...
(Laughter)

Wow, wow, wow.

(Georgian gangster)
Stay seated.

03:11.100 --> 03:13.099
(Dramatic music)

03:25.693 --> 03:27.292
Okay.

03:27.372 --> 03:31.570
I see you Algerians are busy
so this will take only a few minutes.

03:46.522 --> 03:48.521
(Cocking gun)

03:52.119 --> 03:55.518
One of you can walk away. Okay?

03:58.236 --> 04:00.555
(Whistles) Off, you can go.

04:02.594 --> 04:04.393
(Gunshot)

04:04.473 --> 04:06.872
(Groan)

04:10.110 --> 04:13.869
(Medhi whispering prayer)

04:23.184 --> 04:25.583
(Gun parts snapping into place)

04:26.822 --> 04:29.181
Who sold you this?

04:31.580 --> 04:33.779
No? Okay.

04:49.931 --> 04:52.169
Swallow, please.

04:53.129 --> 04:55.128
Ah.

04:56.687 --> 04:58.686
Ah...

05:00.125 --> 05:02.124
Ah.

05:05.563 --> 05:08.441
Swallow. Yes?

05:08.521 --> 05:10.640
(Gulping)

05:11.640 --> 05:14.039
(Gagging)

05:19.876 --> 05:21.875
Again, please.

05:29.431 --> 05:31.430
(Koba) Mm.

05:31.910 --> 05:33.909
(Faz gulping and spluttering)

05:34.508 --> 05:37.427
- (Koba) Just one more.
- (Faz gagging and moaning)

05:39.266 --> 05:41.265
(Gulping)

05:42.744 --> 05:44.183
Yes...

05:44.263 --> 05:47.062
(Moaning and gagging)

05:49.301 --> 05:52.259
(Cocking gun)

05:54.378 --> 05:56.377
(Koba)
It's okay. It's okay.

05:59.416 --> 06:02.694
Ask him if he knows
who sold you the guns.

06:02.774 --> 06:07.212
No answer, you shoot.
You go free. I promise.

06:12.769 --> 06:16.167
We don't know anything...
I swear we don't!

06:16.687 --> 06:19.686
(Koba)
So shoot. Three...

06:19.766 --> 06:22.164
- (Marco) We don't know anything!
- (Koba) Two...

06:22.244 --> 06:23.244
One...

06:23.324 --> 06:24.643
(Dramatic music builds)

06:24.723 --> 06:26.802
(Gunshot)

06:26.882 --> 06:28.721
(Discordant music)

06:28.801 --> 06:30.760
(Faz breathing heavily)

06:30.840 --> 06:33.039
- (Marco moaning)
- (Blood squirting)

06:38.316 --> 06:43.354
Look, I'm here to make the rules now
and secrets are a bad thing.

06:43.914 --> 06:46.752
A really very, very bad thing.

06:51.270 --> 06:53.549
Go tell Uncle Basem.

06:54.308 --> 06:59.146
- Tell him Koba says so. Mm?
- (Faz quivering)

06:59.226 --> 07:01.225
Go.

07:01.625 --> 07:03.024
Go...

07:03.104 --> 07:05.303
(Shouting) Go!

07:05.383 --> 07:08.061
(Georgian gangsters laughing
in the background)

07:26.732 --> 07:28.571
(Whir of washing machine)

(Music stops)

10:29.201 --> 10:31.800
(Elliot gasping and coughing)

10:41.875 --> 10:44.953
(Quiet suspenseful music)

10:53.189 --> 10:55.828
(Phone camera shutter)

11:22.134 --> 11:24.533
(Paper rustling)

11:36.447 --> 11:39.006
(Eerie music)

11:44.523 --> 11:46.522
(Distant sirens)

11:52.319 --> 11:55.478
(Music builds)

11:56.677 --> 11:59.236
(Alex) This is my city.

11:59.316 --> 12:01.315
(Quiet dramatic music)

12:05.553 --> 12:07.592
This is my city.

12:10.390 --> 12:12.389
This is my city.

12:15.228 --> 12:17.227
(Sniffs)

12:23.504 --> 12:28.221
This is my city. I was born
on these streets. They're inside me.

12:28.981 --> 12:31.660
I've seen them change
from year to year

12:31.740 --> 12:34.498
and I know this city's heartbeat
because it's here.

12:34.578 --> 12:36.657
I feel it.

12:36.737 --> 12:40.375
Your startup is looking
for 100 million.

12:40.455 --> 12:42.334
My competitors
will offer you the moon.

12:42.414 --> 12:44.213
Some will throw in a few stars

12:44.293 --> 12:48.011
but I'm the only one
that can join this... to this.

12:49.491 --> 12:53.369
Plus... a buy-in of 200 million.

12:54.928 --> 12:57.127
- (Champagne cork pops)
- Thank you for your trust.

12:57.207 --> 12:59.006
Thank you.

12:59.086 --> 13:01.045
(Soft jazz music in the background)

13:01.125 --> 13:03.724
(Muffled chatter)

13:07.881 --> 13:10.920
2 minutes.
Help yourselves to drinks, yeah?

13:14.878 --> 13:16.877
I'm early.

13:22.194 --> 13:26.232
(Alex) Abdullah Shafak, one of my
clients, was killed in Turkey last night.

13:26.312 --> 13:27.831
Were you aware?

13:27.911 --> 13:30.910
(Asif) The 200 million you laundered
for Shafak wasn't his to give,

13:30.990 --> 13:33.269
nor was it yours to invest elsewhere.

13:33.349 --> 13:37.507
Our investors would like it back.
Does it give you any trouble?

13:39.865 --> 13:42.064
Nothing I can't handle.

13:44.103 --> 13:49.541
You're worried your new friends
will see who they're dealing with.

13:50.420 --> 13:56.377
They're dealing with Dumani Finances.
Clean funds all the way.

13:56.457 --> 13:59.416
- Ignorance is bliss.
- And I don't like surprises,

13:59.496 --> 14:03.654
so next time something like this needs
to happen, how about you tell me?

14:04.173 --> 14:05.852
Reasonable.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.652
Remember, though,
everyone thought

14:07.732 --> 14:10.570
that the Wallaces would
take you down with them.

14:10.650 --> 14:14.008
I never doubted you.

14:16.167 --> 14:18.006
I remember everything.

14:18.086 --> 14:20.405
(Suspenseful music)

14:27.322 --> 14:30.280
Let me know
when you've transferred the funds.

14:38.516 --> 14:40.715
(Suspenseful music fades)

14:43.674 --> 14:45.673
(Tap running)

14:46.272 --> 14:48.471
(Clapping)

14:48.551 --> 14:51.390
(Exhales deeply)

14:53.149 --> 14:55.268
(Sean in a muffled whisper)
Alex...

14:56.707 --> 14:59.746
Alex... Help me.

14:59.825 --> 15:02.024
(Dramatic music)

15:08.741 --> 15:10.700
(Loud clattering)

15:10.780 --> 15:11.859
(Music stops)

15:11.939 --> 15:14.058
Oh, excuse me.

15:26.412 --> 15:28.011
(Sniffs)

15:28.091 --> 15:30.090
(Quiet suspenseful music)

16:00.435 --> 16:03.034
(Muffled chatter)

16:24.423 --> 16:26.422
(Basem)
Can you fix this, Ed?

16:27.422 --> 16:29.940
It's a bit late for that,
don't you think?

16:30.020 --> 16:32.179
Can you fix it?

16:42.574 --> 16:44.573
(Knocking)

16:47.971 --> 16:50.530
(Asif)
I appreciate your presence here

16:50.610 --> 16:54.328
so that we can sort out
this unnecessary mess.

16:54.408 --> 16:56.407
Who chose this shithole?

16:57.487 --> 17:00.485
I think you all know
his name by now.

17:03.604 --> 17:05.802
Koba.

17:05.882 --> 17:09.281
Don't forget
why he was invited to London.

17:09.361 --> 17:12.119
If the bodies were not
piling up on the streets,

17:13.958 --> 17:16.277
if you would have listened
to the warnings,

17:16.357 --> 17:18.636
there would be no need for Koba.

17:19.715 --> 17:21.794
I've given them my word.

17:22.634 --> 17:25.593
The Investors asked for order

17:26.752 --> 17:28.751
and order is what I'm giving them.

17:30.950 --> 17:34.708
I expect you all
to fall in line.

17:36.107 --> 17:38.626
(Suspenseful music)

17:45.343 --> 17:47.342
(Car door slams loudly)

17:53.419 --> 17:55.578
(Thud)

18:02.734 --> 18:05.932
(Clatter of guns)

18:07.492 --> 18:09.491
(Exhales)

18:11.490 --> 18:13.489
Would you mind standing,
please?

18:19.206 --> 18:20.765
(Basem grunts)

18:20.845 --> 18:23.324
(Koba)
Some of you may know Mr Soudani.

18:23.404 --> 18:25.283
You haven't seen
them round this table

18:25.363 --> 18:28.761
but today he's here to help.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.840
Who sold you this?

18:34.198 --> 18:36.397
It was a blind deal.

18:36.477 --> 18:39.116
Ooh! Exciting.
Tell me about that.

18:39.835 --> 18:45.712
Er... No names, no faces.
And er... payment was off-shore.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.151
(Koba)
Good. Very good.

18:48.231 --> 18:52.469
Exactly what I would do,
if I wanted to insult Mr Afridi.

18:53.549 --> 18:56.587
If I wanted to make a fool of me.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.786
That's what I would do.

19:00.825 --> 19:02.824
Boss here said this.

19:04.063 --> 19:08.221
Nobody sells guns
in this city except me.

19:12.859 --> 19:16.177
Which bit of that was fuzzy?
Which bit didn't add up?

19:19.016 --> 19:23.134
You owe a debt to myself,
to Mr Afridi. Yes?

19:30.850 --> 19:33.369
But that's for later.

19:38.486 --> 19:41.165
Business has rules.

19:42.644 --> 19:44.763
I see they are followed.

19:46.442 --> 19:51.719
Our friend here made a mistake.
He knows that.

19:51.799 --> 19:54.798
But whoever sold these guns
doesn't want rules.

19:54.878 --> 19:56.877
They think they are special.

19:57.357 --> 20:01.115
Shall I tell you who else
thought they were special?

20:01.195 --> 20:03.194
Finn Wallace.

20:03.713 --> 20:05.792
His lunatic son.

20:06.952 --> 20:09.351
Do they sit with us now?

20:12.109 --> 20:15.268
Ed Dumani knows
what I'm talking about.

20:15.348 --> 20:18.546
Did he make mistakes back then?
Maybe so.

20:19.745 --> 20:22.904
But he understands
things had to change.

20:24.903 --> 20:27.502
There's a future for you,
right, Edward?

20:27.582 --> 20:30.260
And your son, Alex.

20:34.898 --> 20:38.176
Somebody here
wants to start a war.

20:38.856 --> 20:40.615
One they cannot win.

20:40.695 --> 20:43.254
I gave Mr Afridi my word.

20:45.533 --> 20:47.731
I will find you.

20:50.170 --> 20:54.248
And you will make amends.

20:56.047 --> 20:58.246
(Loud bang)

20:58.326 --> 21:00.525
(Dramatic music)

21:05.882 --> 21:07.881
(Watch fastening clicking)

21:09.121 --> 21:11.120
(Koba sighs)

21:24.673 --> 21:27.591
(Ed) He doesn't know
the first thing about this city.

21:27.671 --> 21:29.710
(Asif)
Why do you think I chose him?

21:29.790 --> 21:31.869
No affiliations.

21:32.549 --> 21:34.708
- He's a clean skin.
- He's a wind-up.

21:34.788 --> 21:38.066
Help me find out
who's behind the guns.

21:40.665 --> 21:46.422
These people still listen
to Ed Dumani... don't they?

21:49.860 --> 21:51.859
(Music fades)

21:51.939 --> 21:55.138
- (Muffled chatter)
- (Hum of traffic)

21:59.815 --> 22:01.814
(Groaning)

22:03.653 --> 22:05.652
(Munching)

22:08.411 --> 22:10.410
(Groaning)

22:10.930 --> 22:14.368
(Basem) Such a tragedy.
His family is waiting.

22:14.888 --> 22:16.887
(Groaning)

22:18.806 --> 22:22.564
Blessings be upon you.
Marco was a good boy.

22:28.121 --> 22:31.480
Faz, help me get this down...
Faz?

22:40.355 --> 22:42.354
(Tea being poured)

22:51.110 --> 22:53.109
(Music fades)

22:55.268 --> 22:57.746
(Indistinct Algerian Arabic speech)

22:57.826 --> 23:00.265
(Saba)
They're saying it's a car accident?

23:02.824 --> 23:05.183
Wasn't that, was it?

23:07.182 --> 23:09.381
(Subdued music)

23:32.369 --> 23:34.368
Faz.

23:38.446 --> 23:41.045
What's going on? Huh? What?

23:42.524 --> 23:45.642
- You knew, innit?
- What you talking about?

23:45.722 --> 23:49.201
You knew Koba was coming.
That's why you didn't want me there.

23:49.281 --> 23:52.399
All right. Let's go and tell
Marco's little daughters what happened.

23:52.479 --> 23:56.277
That big man Faz blew Marco's fucking
brains out to save his own skin.

23:57.876 --> 24:02.074
Look at me.
Basem doesn't know what day it is.

24:02.154 --> 24:04.913
He's got us
in the wrong fucking sight.

24:07.152 --> 24:09.151
Now we got to cover
for that Albanian prick.

24:09.630 --> 24:11.949
We just arrived.

24:12.029 --> 24:14.588
Yeah, the removal guys are here too.

24:14.668 --> 24:17.227
Okay, come tonight.
We'd love to see you.

24:18.426 --> 24:20.625
No problem, no.

24:20.705 --> 24:23.464
(Gentle orchestral music
plays in the background)

24:23.543 --> 24:26.262
No socks on the shiny stairs.

24:26.342 --> 24:28.341
We just arrived.

24:28.981 --> 24:30.980
(Kiss)

24:31.060 --> 24:33.139
(Sighs)

24:33.219 --> 24:36.497
From Saranda.
They're coming over this afternoon.

24:36.577 --> 24:38.256
But we said tomorrow, right?

24:38.336 --> 24:42.214
What, so I say don't come?
She's too excited.

24:42.294 --> 24:44.293
Zamir's bringing his guitar.

24:44.373 --> 24:46.372
(Laughs)

24:46.732 --> 24:48.731
My sweetheart.

24:55.008 --> 24:57.726
(Suspenseful music)

25:12.159 --> 25:14.158
(Suspenseful music fades)

25:20.195 --> 25:22.194
My sister-in-law made that.

25:23.753 --> 25:25.752
Thank you.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.709
Nice place.

25:32.789 --> 25:34.788
Thank you.

25:37.706 --> 25:41.025
Basem did a fantastic cover-up job.

25:53.019 --> 25:55.857
What are you talking about? (Sigh)

25:55.937 --> 26:01.534
Luan, I know you sold him those guns.

26:02.214 --> 26:05.093
- And who am I talking to?
- I'm here to help you.

26:06.132 --> 26:09.890
Help me... or yourself?

26:11.489 --> 26:13.209
You choose sides so fast.

26:13.289 --> 26:15.328
That kind of weaponry
is unprecedented.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.407
My partners need
to defend themselves.

26:19.406 --> 26:20.925
I need to defend myself.

26:21.005 --> 26:22.764
So you're plotting a war?

26:22.844 --> 26:27.681
I know how volatile things are right now
but that's not good for anyone's business.

26:30.360 --> 26:33.039
Heroin is my business now.

26:34.598 --> 26:37.556
I've always used my own suppliers.

26:37.636 --> 26:41.474
Trusted, productive people
from back home.

26:41.554 --> 26:47.831
Now Koba wants me to buy from Asif.

26:48.951 --> 26:50.950
Only him.

26:52.749 --> 26:55.268
Do you know why?

26:55.348 --> 26:57.506
So he can control me.

26:57.586 --> 26:59.585
I won't do it.

27:01.824 --> 27:04.303
Because next time
he's gonna come around,

27:04.983 --> 27:08.861
it's not my supply he'll want.
It's my profit.

27:10.100 --> 27:13.259
And he already got his boot
on my neck.

27:15.897 --> 27:18.776
This is not how we do business

27:18.856 --> 27:20.975
- in this city.
- (Slam)

27:23.254 --> 27:25.093
What if I offer you reassurances?

27:25.173 --> 27:27.172
From Koba?
(Scoffs)

27:27.731 --> 27:29.970
- Bullshit.
- From the Investors.

27:30.050 --> 27:32.169
I'm not gonna lay down
and beg like the others.

27:32.249 --> 27:34.648
Then you're going to have
to give something in return, Luan.

27:34.728 --> 27:37.367
Who supplied those guns?

27:41.325 --> 27:43.324
First things first.

27:44.763 --> 27:47.761
Talk to the Investors.
I need guarantees.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.319
I'm glad you're listening.

27:54.958 --> 27:56.957
Thinking about all this.

27:59.475 --> 28:01.474
All this is why I fight.

28:02.714 --> 28:05.472
(Suspenseful music)

28:12.069 --> 28:14.068
(Mirlinda and children giggling)

28:16.547 --> 28:18.626
(Mirlinda and children exclaim)

28:18.706 --> 28:21.105
(Mirlinda's and children's voices echo)

28:21.185 --> 28:23.184
(Music fades)

28:24.263 --> 28:27.741
(Shower running)

28:39.455 --> 28:42.654
(Heavy breathing)

28:44.813 --> 28:49.810
- (Quiet suspenseful music)
- (Glass shard clattering)

28:49.890 --> 28:51.889
(Miss Kane)
What's going on Elliot?

28:54.008 --> 28:57.366
You were told to hit Mr Shafak
on arrival in his car.

28:59.565 --> 29:04.523
You were late. You were drunk.
You drew undue attention to us.

29:05.562 --> 29:09.880
We plan these things.
You follow the plan.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.959
Or there are consequences.

29:15.597 --> 29:19.355
We own you
and your father, Elliot.

29:19.435 --> 29:21.554
Do you have a problem with that?

29:24.433 --> 29:26.192
(Whispering) No.

29:26.272 --> 29:28.271
(Pills rattling)

29:28.671 --> 29:30.670
Good.

29:31.230 --> 29:34.108
The fee has been released
to the usual accounts.

29:34.188 --> 29:36.187
Wait one second...

29:41.624 --> 29:43.943
Did you receive the itinerary?

29:44.583 --> 29:46.622
(Eerie music)

29:48.741 --> 29:51.100
Been a while, hasn't it?

29:51.180 --> 29:53.618
I've let our contacts know
you'll be arriving.

29:54.898 --> 29:57.976
The order of things has shifted
since you were last there.

29:59.335 --> 30:01.334
Elliot...

30:01.414 --> 30:05.213
I know when you left it was difficult

30:05.293 --> 30:07.331
but don't get distracted by the past.

30:07.411 --> 30:10.250
(Muffled shouting and banging)

30:11.769 --> 30:14.088
(Metallic clang echoes)

30:15.527 --> 30:17.966
(Buzzing)

30:20.885 --> 30:23.124
(Suspenseful music)

30:32.319 --> 30:34.318
(Prison officer)
Signature there.

30:37.037 --> 30:41.514
Don't tell my family anything.
Understood?

30:48.631 --> 30:50.630
Cop killer!

31:04.943 --> 31:07.142
(Suspenseful music fades)

31:10.180 --> 31:12.459
Espresso, please.

31:15.138 --> 31:19.535
So Luan is distributing the guns.
I wish I could say I was surprised.

31:19.615 --> 31:22.774
It's a play for leverage.
He needs peace to run his business.

31:22.854 --> 31:26.612
He wants to maintain his own supply.
He doesn't want to buy from you.

31:26.692 --> 31:29.211
- It's a good price.
- For now.

31:29.290 --> 31:31.649
But Luan's not stupid.

31:31.729 --> 31:33.608
He has a major stake
in this town now.

31:33.688 --> 31:36.847
Manpower. Allies.
He's not to be underestimated.

31:37.766 --> 31:39.565
What would he settle for?

31:39.645 --> 31:42.204
A guarantee from the Investors.

31:42.284 --> 31:47.401
A degree of independence
in return for his loyalty.

31:47.481 --> 31:51.639
And all this nonsense
with guns... stops?

31:51.719 --> 31:53.798
And he will tell us
who supplied them.

31:53.878 --> 31:56.717
He will. Trust me.

31:57.596 --> 32:01.235
(Asif) Of course.
I'll instruct Koba to hold off for now.

32:01.314 --> 32:05.312
But until he gives us his supplier,
Luan is on thin ice.

32:05.392 --> 32:07.671
(Muffled rock music
in the background)

32:07.751 --> 32:09.750
(Asif)
Thank you for looking into this, Ed.

32:13.388 --> 32:17.906
You know, Finn Wallace
was an old fool.

32:17.986 --> 32:21.584
But he was smart...
when he chose you.

32:21.664 --> 32:23.783
(Soft piano music
in the background)

32:23.863 --> 32:25.862
(Chuckles)

32:29.740 --> 32:32.179

32:32.259 --> 32:34.738

32:34.818 --> 32:39.815

(Music intensifies)

33:44.783 --> 33:46.782
(Music fades)

33:46.862 --> 33:48.861
(School bell ringing)

33:52.339 --> 33:53.778
- Bye.
- Bye, Danny.

33:53.858 --> 33:56.017
(Quiet suspenseful music)

33:59.775 --> 34:02.174
Here, I'll carry it.
How was football.?

34:13.208 --> 34:15.207
- Mum?
- Hey. Hi!

34:15.847 --> 34:18.246
Sorry. Excuse me?
Ms Dumani?

34:21.085 --> 34:23.084
(Phone vibrating)

34:28.121 --> 34:29.121
Yes?

34:29.200 --> 34:32.959
(Jamya) Mr Dumani.
Your daughter, she's taken Danny.

34:35.957 --> 34:37.596
(Ed)
Thank you, Jamya.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.395
What should I do? She just...

34:39.475 --> 34:41.514
I'll take it from here.

34:52.629 --> 34:54.628
Shannon's out.

34:56.387 --> 34:58.426
(Ed)
I spoke to her lawyer.

34:58.506 --> 35:00.785
The police messed up
evidence procedures.

35:00.865 --> 35:02.904
Her case would have
fallen apart at trial.

35:02.984 --> 35:04.383
That's the best news.

35:04.463 --> 35:06.862
She told her lawyer
not to contact the family.

35:08.261 --> 35:11.979
(Ed) I told her I would get her out
once things had calmed down.

35:12.059 --> 35:15.018
She killed a cop, Alex.
I don't have a magic wand.

35:15.098 --> 35:17.416
She knew my hands were tied.

35:17.496 --> 35:19.975
She told you she understood.
She told me she understood.

35:20.055 --> 35:22.214
That's what we wanted to hear.

35:22.294 --> 35:23.853
What?

35:23.933 --> 35:25.372
She killed that cop to protect us.

35:25.452 --> 35:27.531
Our lives carried on as usual.

35:27.611 --> 35:30.050
Look... She'll come home.

35:32.049 --> 35:34.048
We should celebrate.

35:35.887 --> 35:37.766
I did everything in my power.

35:37.846 --> 35:40.165
- You did.
- (Sighs) What a day.

35:42.164 --> 35:44.163
She's back.

35:45.842 --> 35:48.521
We got her back.

35:48.601 --> 35:50.960
This means we can be a family again.

36:05.073 --> 36:07.791
(Suspenseful music builds
then fades)

36:08.591 --> 36:11.749
- Uncle Alex.
- How you doing, big man? Hey!

36:11.829 --> 36:16.347
Danny, um, I need to speak
to Uncle Alex. Take this for me.

36:20.425 --> 36:22.904
Your lawyer told me you were here.

36:22.984 --> 36:25.662
Oh, you paid her? That's nice.

36:25.742 --> 36:30.340
I had to see you. I'm sorry.
You can beat me up if you like.

36:30.420 --> 36:32.819
No, don't. Don't.
I'm not doing it like that.

36:32.899 --> 36:35.137
- I'll do it however you like.
- I want to be with Danny.

36:36.577 --> 36:41.934
So you can go back to your tower
and do... whatever it is you do.

36:42.014 --> 36:43.133
Work.

36:43.213 --> 36:46.332
You and Dad decided it's a fuck sight
more important than my life.

36:48.051 --> 36:50.730
- Look...
- That was the deal you made.

36:55.487 --> 36:58.126
You're right. We gave in.

36:59.525 --> 37:01.324
The people I work for,
the Investors,

37:01.404 --> 37:04.763
they didn't want a Dumani
walking free on a cop killing.

37:04.843 --> 37:06.642
I'm bad for the brand.

37:06.722 --> 37:10.440
I'm getting us out.
Out of all of this.

37:11.399 --> 37:13.638
And I'm so close, Shannon.

37:13.718 --> 37:16.877
Soon I'll have us out
of this whole fucking world. I promise.

37:16.957 --> 37:19.395
No more laundering.
No more Investors.

37:19.475 --> 37:21.154
I'll take care of all of us.

37:21.234 --> 37:23.233
Everything I'm doing...

37:24.673 --> 37:26.872
I can make this right.

37:26.952 --> 37:29.790
Better than right, I swear.

37:29.870 --> 37:31.869
It's on me now.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.986
I'll sort myself out.

37:39.665 --> 37:44.463
If you do want to help...
leave us alone.

38:01.214 --> 38:03.213
(Asif) I hear you're meeting
with the Investors tonight

38:03.293 --> 38:05.172
about your start-up
financing scheme.

38:05.252 --> 38:07.251
Do you really think that's wise?

38:08.411 --> 38:10.690
Look, like I said before,

38:10.770 --> 38:16.007
this model is completely compatible
with what I do for the Investors.

38:17.326 --> 38:20.365
The more it thrives, the better partner
I can be for them and their business.

38:20.445 --> 38:22.444
For how long?

38:23.603 --> 38:25.642
Looking at the direction of your travel,

38:25.722 --> 38:28.521
is your plan to escape
from them completely?

38:28.601 --> 38:32.479
You need that 200 million
for your new business, don't you?

38:33.398 --> 38:37.116
I'm told the Investor concerned
would like it passed over to him.

38:37.196 --> 38:38.916
Don't make him wait.

38:38.996 --> 38:41.354
I've made more money for them
than anyone in this city.

38:41.434 --> 38:46.232
We were attacked today, Alex.
It's not a good time for negotiations.

38:46.312 --> 38:48.591
Pretty sure I know how they think.

38:48.671 --> 38:51.949
Maybe even better than you.
All due respect.

38:55.107 --> 38:57.266
(Laughs)

38:58.746 --> 39:00.745
Forgive me.

39:01.064 --> 39:04.143
You think clean money
means a clean soul?

39:04.223 --> 39:08.461
What happened to Sean,
to your family... it was just business.

39:08.541 --> 39:10.580
Fuck you.

39:10.660 --> 39:12.899
You've bitten the hand
that feeds you.

39:12.979 --> 39:16.097
Don't be surprised
if it bites you back.

39:19.255 --> 39:21.614
You should have let me
handle this.

39:29.690 --> 39:31.689
Good luck with your meeting.

39:34.528 --> 39:37.286
(Suspenseful music)

39:40.565 --> 39:43.403
(Suspenseful music continues)

39:43.483 --> 39:45.802
(Car unlocking beep)

40:06.512 --> 40:08.711
(Car engine starting)

40:08.791 --> 40:11.189
(Dramatic music)

40:12.109 --> 40:14.588
(Car accelerating)

40:17.666 --> 40:19.945
(Music builds)

40:32.219 --> 40:35.857
Hold off on the next delivery.
There is an issue on my end.

40:35.937 --> 40:37.936
Everything is okay.

40:38.616 --> 40:40.775
I'll share details later.

40:40.855 --> 40:42.534
(Sigh)

40:42.614 --> 40:47.131
Please confirm no delivery.
I'll wait for a call.

40:50.810 --> 40:53.568
(Mirlinda humming)

41:00.085 --> 41:02.764
(Gentle music)

41:10.840 --> 41:12.839
Honey.

41:32.949 --> 41:34.948
Hey.

41:42.544 --> 41:44.543
(Laughter)

41:48.781 --> 41:50.780
(Knocking)

41:52.379 --> 41:54.378
Save me a slice, yeah?

42:30.320 --> 42:32.319
(Bag zipping shut)

42:39.675 --> 42:42.034

42:44.433 --> 42:48.911
(Sniffs) Uh, I'm expecting guests
so send them up to the terrace.

43:33.328 --> 43:34.808
Asif.

43:34.888 --> 43:36.887
Ed...

43:37.366 --> 43:39.605
The Investors have made it clear.

43:40.205 --> 43:43.163
Anyone who acts out of line
is to be dealt with.

43:44.003 --> 43:46.082
Zero tolerance.

43:48.161 --> 43:50.680
I'm sorry but my hands are tied,

43:50.760 --> 43:52.759
(Mirlinda)
Luan. What's wrong?

44:08.471 --> 44:10.670
(Deep exhale)

44:11.909 --> 44:13.908
(Sniff)

44:14.668 --> 44:16.946

(Cocking gun)

44:39.575 --> 44:42.054
(Music quietens)

44:52.089 --> 44:55.487
Just put it down and we'll talk.

44:58.806 --> 45:00.805
Sit.

45:32.709 --> 45:34.708
You're working for them?

45:37.506 --> 45:39.825
That's almost funny.
(Light chuckle)

45:40.545 --> 45:42.544
Fuck!

45:47.981 --> 45:51.659
You killed Sean for them?
You fucking snake.

45:51.739 --> 45:53.858
- I didn't have a choice.
- Poor Elliot.

45:53.938 --> 45:58.616
You know, you're only here
because they wanted you here.

45:59.815 --> 46:03.973
And now they don't.
Too much of a liability.

46:09.970 --> 46:11.969
What the fuck are you waiting for?

46:16.487 --> 46:17.966
(Deep inhale)

46:18.046 --> 46:19.485
(Gun clicks)

46:19.565 --> 46:21.884
(Music fades)

46:26.322 --> 46:29.520
(Contemplative melancholic music)

46:33.638 --> 46:37.916
Our bosses.
Years of incrimination.

46:37.996 --> 46:40.475
Years of wrongdoing.
It's all there.

46:45.632 --> 46:48.391
- Sean gave you this?
- Can't go to the police.

46:48.471 --> 46:51.189
Courts. Media.
The Investors own it all.

46:52.948 --> 46:55.827
But with you, this...

46:57.786 --> 46:59.705
this is how we get out.

46:59.785 --> 47:01.544
You want to blackmail the Investors?

47:01.624 --> 47:04.023
And you'll know how.
Better than anyone.

47:05.742 --> 47:09.900
I can't do this by myself, Alex.
I've tried.

47:11.859 --> 47:15.137
But you know who to contact.
Make a deal.

47:15.217 --> 47:17.696
Think about it.

47:17.776 --> 47:21.054
My father. Your family.
Both of us.

47:22.494 --> 47:26.012
This will keep us safe,
all right?

47:32.129 --> 47:35.527
Was there anything
I could have done...

47:35.607 --> 47:37.606
to save Sean?

47:38.925 --> 47:40.924
No.

47:42.764 --> 47:44.763
No.

47:47.241 --> 47:49.840
Open your laptop.
Look at these files.

47:57.836 --> 47:59.835
Please, Alex.

48:00.515 --> 48:03.953
They'll find me.
They'll kill my family.

48:07.351 --> 48:09.350
I can't allow that to happen.

48:20.345 --> 48:22.783
Go to Shannon. She needs you.

48:23.783 --> 48:25.782
What?

48:26.102 --> 48:28.341
Watch over my father.

48:33.178 --> 48:35.297
No, Alex! Stop!

48:36.137 --> 48:37.536
You can't beat them.

48:37.616 --> 48:39.615
No! No! No... Alex!

49:07.921 --> 49:09.920
(Melancholic music fades)

49:11.319 --> 49:13.958
(Voicemail)
You have no new messages.

49:18.196 --> 49:20.195

50:30.680 --> 50:32.479
(Dog barking loudly)

50:32.559 --> 50:35.797
Zeus. What's up, my boy?

50:37.116 --> 50:38.915
You want some cheese?

50:38.995 --> 50:40.994
Come. Come.

50:42.634 --> 50:44.593
Come.

50:44.673 --> 50:46.672
Wanna pee?

50:48.111 --> 50:50.110
Come. Get out.

Wake up, girls. Quick...

52:02.234 --> 52:04.233
Papa?

52:06.911 --> 52:08.830
What's happened?

52:08.910 --> 52:10.310
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

52:10.390 --> 52:12.708
- What's happening?
- Go inside.

52:12.788 --> 52:15.347
- Something's wrong.
- Get the girls in first.

52:15.427 --> 52:17.426
Go, babe, go.

52:17.986 --> 52:19.785
Mummy loves you.

52:19.865 --> 52:22.184
(Beeping)

52:23.223 --> 52:24.782
Tell me what's going on.

52:24.862 --> 52:26.542
Quiet, take your sister.
What's happening?

52:26.622 --> 52:29.260
- Nothing.
- Don't tell me it's nothing...

52:29.340 --> 52:31.579
- Listen to me.
- What's going on?

52:31.659 --> 52:34.857
- What's the code to the safe?
- The code?

52:35.897 --> 52:37.936
It's your birthday.
But tell me what's happen...

52:38.016 --> 52:40.455
(Kiss) Everything's okay.
Stay with the girls.
