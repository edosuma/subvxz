31:36.807 --> 31:38.984
Listen, I've been thinking
a lot about you today.

31:39.027 --> 31:41.769
Back in the day,
when I told you why I enlisted.

31:41.812 --> 31:43.684
I remember.

31:43.727 --> 31:46.513
See, I told myself it wasbecause I wanted to help people,

31:46.556 --> 31:49.342
I wanted to see the world.

31:49.385 --> 31:51.344
And not because
I wanted to hurt you.

31:52.736 --> 31:55.174
The truth is,

31:55.217 --> 31:57.916
part of it is because
I did want to hurt you.

31:59.482 --> 32:01.615
I understand.
You were 17 years old.

32:01.658 --> 32:04.183
Back then, I thought if
I followed your wishes,

32:04.226 --> 32:05.836
chased your dream...

32:05.880 --> 32:08.970
it would bring us close
again, and I...

32:09.014 --> 32:11.625
I just didn't want that.
I wanted to hurt you.

32:11.668 --> 32:14.671
And I know that I hurt you, too.

32:16.064 --> 32:20.286
I wish I had old-man wisdom
back then.

32:20.329 --> 32:22.766
You were afraid
of losing me again,

32:22.810 --> 32:25.726
and I deserved that hurt.

32:25.769 --> 32:29.425
But love is worth
the inevitability of loss, son.

32:31.993 --> 32:33.995
I'm still here.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.476
We both are.

32:38.043 --> 32:41.002
Young blood, what do youthink of all this?

32:41.046 --> 32:43.004
It's crazy.

32:43.048 --> 32:44.527
I thought this all started
from the Black Lives Matter,

32:44.571 --> 32:45.746
Blue Lives Matter stuff.

32:45.789 --> 32:49.663
New name. Same issues.
Different decades.

32:49.706 --> 32:51.404
Isn't that frustrating?

32:51.447 --> 32:53.014
Depends on what timeof the day you ask me.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.624
[scoffs]

32:54.668 --> 32:57.366
Don't you think
we made progress?

32:57.410 --> 32:59.847
We're still trying, D.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.548
Every year, the purpose
of this event

33:05.592 --> 33:07.333
is to bring people together.

33:07.376 --> 33:10.945
Make sure you know the faces of
your law enforcement officers.

33:10.989 --> 33:15.167
Make sure law enforcement
officers humanize the faces

33:15.210 --> 33:16.995
they help and interact with.

33:17.038 --> 33:19.867
The last thing we want
is to repeat '92.

33:19.910 --> 33:23.784
We encountered our share of...

33:23.827 --> 33:25.829
You seem really nervous.

33:25.873 --> 33:28.136
I'm just observing.

33:28.180 --> 33:32.053
I can't wait to hear
this story of yours.

33:32.097 --> 33:34.055
You know, you and I havecome a long way.

33:34.099 --> 33:35.709
I'm not sure I always liked you.

33:35.752 --> 33:37.319
And now?

33:38.581 --> 33:40.931
[phone chimes]

33:43.064 --> 33:44.848
Now you look nervous.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.546
Is that the mayor again?Yeah.

33:46.589 --> 33:48.852
It's the coronavirus.

33:48.896 --> 33:50.898
The mayor's been on the phone
with the CDC and the governor.

33:50.941 --> 33:52.856
They may have
to shut the city down.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.902
Shelter at home, businesses
closed down; the whole shebang.

33:54.945 --> 33:56.034
What's that mean for SWAT?

33:56.077 --> 33:58.384
It means the world's
about to change.

34:01.430 --> 34:03.693
So, uh, you ever gonna tell me?

34:03.737 --> 34:06.740
Tell you what?Your memories of the riots.

34:06.783 --> 34:07.915
There's obviously something

34:07.958 --> 34:09.569
rattling aroundin that head of yours.

34:09.612 --> 34:11.831
So you think you can
read me or something?

34:11.875 --> 34:14.139
Of course I can.[chuckles]

34:14.181 --> 34:15.313
Just spit it out.

34:15.357 --> 34:18.926
Okay, um, I don't remember much,

34:18.969 --> 34:21.233
but I got my first CD player
during the riots.

34:21.275 --> 34:22.799
My mother gave it to me
as a gift.

34:24.279 --> 34:27.282
I later realized that
she looted it from some store,

34:27.326 --> 34:30.371
along with a microwave
and a hair curler.

34:31.851 --> 34:33.505
[sighs]

34:33.549 --> 34:35.420
Something really awful
was going on out there,

34:35.464 --> 34:38.598
and her drunk ass saw it
as an opportunity

34:38.641 --> 34:41.034
to steal some stuff.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.516
Thought that counts?

34:46.127 --> 34:48.434
I gotta admit,
I loved that CD player.

34:50.739 --> 34:52.873
You know, I imagine
that the expectation is

34:52.916 --> 34:56.050
for me to get up here
and talk about my experience

34:56.094 --> 34:57.834
during the '92 riots.

34:57.878 --> 35:00.359
Back then I was younger,

35:00.402 --> 35:02.361
inexperienced.

35:02.404 --> 35:04.406
I was a patrol officer.

35:06.191 --> 35:09.716
Probably not
a very good cop back then.

35:09.759 --> 35:11.674
The thing is,

35:11.718 --> 35:14.416
I didn't work the riots.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.723
The day when everything
went down,

35:16.766 --> 35:20.770
my partner and I were ordered
by our superior officer

35:20.814 --> 35:22.729
to vacate your neighborhoods.

35:22.772 --> 35:27.603
We were reassigned
to protect Century City.

35:27.647 --> 35:29.170
We could have gone
against those orders

35:29.214 --> 35:31.520
and suffered the consequences,

35:31.564 --> 35:33.174
but we didn't.

35:34.958 --> 35:38.353
So our view of the riots
was watching our city burn

35:38.397 --> 35:39.659
from ten miles away.

35:41.835 --> 35:44.968
But today I hold
my SWAT officers

35:45.012 --> 35:46.622
to a much higher standard.

35:48.233 --> 35:51.671
And 28 years ago, I wishI had lived up to that standard.

35:51.714 --> 35:55.588
Yesterday, one of my sergeants
made a judgement call.

35:55.631 --> 35:58.156
Went against my orders

35:58.199 --> 36:00.854
because he thought
it would save lives.

36:00.897 --> 36:01.985
And it did.

36:03.509 --> 36:06.164
I wish I had called an audible
back in '92.

36:07.556 --> 36:10.342
Maybe I could have helped
in some way.

36:10.385 --> 36:12.082
But I have to live with that.

36:15.260 --> 36:18.567
But then there's days
like today...

36:18.611 --> 36:23.703
when I'm reminded of
how far I've come...

36:23.746 --> 36:25.922
and how far I hope
our city has come.

36:30.579 --> 36:32.102
Is something up?

36:33.756 --> 36:36.237
What are you celebrating?

36:36.281 --> 36:38.239
Like '92 was the end of it.

36:39.414 --> 36:43.723
It's still going on.
The same problems.

36:43.766 --> 36:46.204
A system that never got fixed.

36:46.247 --> 36:48.467
Let me explain
something to you.

36:48.510 --> 36:52.471
When I was 17,
same age as you,

36:52.514 --> 36:55.561
I'm walking home from school--
band practice.

36:55.604 --> 36:57.954
I had my trumpet
in my case.

36:57.998 --> 37:02.132
And an unmarked car
rolls up on me,

37:02.176 --> 37:06.963
and two grown white men
with badges jump out,

37:07.007 --> 37:10.793
pushed me up against the wall,
threw my horn on the ground.

37:10.837 --> 37:12.839
It gets all bent up.

37:12.882 --> 37:14.319
And then they take out
a switchblade,

37:14.362 --> 37:17.017
and they laughing
and chuckling.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.933
And they took that blade,

37:19.976 --> 37:23.937
and they put it
right across my throat.

37:23.980 --> 37:27.332
And they said,
"Get your ass out of here,

37:27.375 --> 37:31.771
or we'll kill you,
and nobody will care."

37:35.644 --> 37:38.168
I was just...

37:38.212 --> 37:40.910
walking home.

37:40.954 --> 37:44.566
So...

37:44.610 --> 37:49.005
you choose to put on a badge,you better know what that means.

37:49.049 --> 37:52.879
'Cause ain't no easy solution

37:52.922 --> 37:54.663
when Black people are
being treated

37:54.707 --> 37:56.752
like they're disposable.

37:58.841 --> 38:02.280
And all a police
officer needs is

38:02.323 --> 38:07.328
reasonable fear
to kill you, me...

38:07.372 --> 38:11.506
or Hondo, if he ain't
wearing that uniform.

38:14.988 --> 38:16.294
What's going on?

38:16.337 --> 38:19.427
That day...

38:19.471 --> 38:23.126
that you told me you enlisted.

38:23.170 --> 38:24.737
Did you know what
you were signing up for?

38:24.780 --> 38:28.828
I thought we done
been past this, Pop.

38:28.871 --> 38:30.830
Didn't you tell me
if I want things to change,

38:30.873 --> 38:32.005
be the change?

38:32.048 --> 38:35.617
And? What have
we seen change, son? Huh?

38:37.140 --> 38:38.838
Let me tell you abouta little boy I once knew.

38:38.881 --> 38:41.754
Somebody asked him,

38:41.797 --> 38:45.497
"How will it be okay?"

38:45.540 --> 38:49.152
His answer?

38:49.196 --> 38:51.807
"It ain't me, it ain't us,

38:51.851 --> 38:54.244
"it ain't them.

38:55.724 --> 38:58.205
"It's the cops.

38:58.248 --> 39:01.556
Y'all are the onesthat's killing us."

39:01.600 --> 39:05.691
He said that in 1965,
but it sounds like today.

39:05.734 --> 39:08.215
See, it's a generational wound
that just keeps...

39:08.258 --> 39:10.870
getting picked at
every few decades

39:10.913 --> 39:14.613
because we refuse
to learn the lesson.

39:14.656 --> 39:17.398
Maybe we learn
the lesson this time.

39:17.442 --> 39:18.965
Don't do that.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.576
Don't be naive.

39:25.014 --> 39:29.279
You're the son of a...

39:29.323 --> 39:32.152
a renegade Slauson.

39:32.195 --> 39:34.110
At least you used to be.

39:36.461 --> 39:39.420
I saw Watts burn

39:39.464 --> 39:43.555
while police went killing.

39:43.598 --> 39:45.470
You saw it in '92.

39:49.125 --> 39:51.389
What's this boy gonna see?

40:10.843 --> 40:12.671
Yo, sellout pig!

40:12.714 --> 40:15.195
No justice, no peace!

40:15.238 --> 40:17.502
Damn these racist-ass police.[protesters shouting]

40:17.545 --> 40:20.853
No justice, no peace!

40:20.896 --> 40:22.855
Damn these racist-ass police!

40:22.898 --> 40:25.379
No justice, no peace!

40:25.423 --> 40:27.642
Damn these racist-ass police!

40:27.686 --> 40:29.992
No justice, no peace!

40:30.036 --> 40:32.995
Damn these racist-ass police!

40:33.039 --> 40:35.041
These were George Floyd's
final words

40:35.084 --> 40:37.783
before he died
at the hands of police.

40:37.826 --> 40:41.177
"It's my face, man.

40:41.221 --> 40:44.790
"I didn't do nothing
serious, man, please...

40:44.833 --> 40:48.315
please... please..."

40:48.358 --> 40:49.708
[chanting continues]

40:49.751 --> 40:52.711
"I can't breathe.

40:52.754 --> 40:54.321
"Please, man, please.

40:54.364 --> 40:57.498
"Somebody, please, man.I can't breathe.

40:57.542 --> 40:59.544
I can't breathe."

40:59.587 --> 41:00.936
PROTESTERS [chanting]:
I can't breathe.

41:00.980 --> 41:01.981
"Please.

41:03.852 --> 41:06.812
I can't breathe. My face.
Just get up."

41:06.855 --> 41:09.249
PROTESTERS:
I can't breathe!

41:09.292 --> 41:11.991
"I can't breathe. Please!"

41:12.034 --> 41:14.384
PROTESTERS: I can't breathe!"Shit."

41:15.385 --> 41:16.517
[chanting continues]

41:20.478 --> 41:23.916
"I can't move, Mama.

41:23.959 --> 41:26.614
"Mama, I'm through.
I'm through.

41:26.658 --> 41:28.137
"I'm claustrophobic.

41:28.181 --> 41:31.619
"My stomach hurts, my neck hurt.Everything hurt.

41:31.663 --> 41:34.535
"Some water or something,
please.
