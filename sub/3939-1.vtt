<i>THE GIFTED HANDS</i>

01:57.545 --> 01:59.446
The miracle

01:59.514 --> 02:03.315
was in this cup of water

02:05.286 --> 02:07.255
After my business went bankrupt

02:07.322 --> 02:09.291
I hit rock bottom and found myself
holding a fistful of pills

02:09.389 --> 02:12.360
In what would've been
the last sip of water of my life,

02:12.427 --> 02:15.488
I smelt a hint of disinfectant and

02:15.563 --> 02:19.364
came face to face
with my personal miracle

02:20.335 --> 02:21.303
Water!

02:21.402 --> 02:23.303
Water that we drink from the moment

02:23.371 --> 02:26.239
we're born to the day we die

02:26.307 --> 02:28.242
Yes! Water!

02:28.443 --> 02:30.469
ZK Communications was born

02:30.545 --> 02:33.447
with a company motto:

02:33.548 --> 02:39.579
'Present the world with a cup of miracle'

02:44.359 --> 02:45.452
Some might call us

02:45.560 --> 02:49.258
a pyramid scheme

02:49.297 --> 02:51.493
Despite such, pardon me,
'bullshit',

02:51.599 --> 02:54.433
such a slanderous accusation,

02:54.636 --> 02:56.604
is ZK Communications
a pyramid scheme?

02:56.604 --> 02:57.639
No

02:57.639 --> 02:59.707
What is ZK Communications?

02:59.707 --> 03:01.573
A network marketing company

03:01.643 --> 03:02.610
One more time

03:02.610 --> 03:06.205
Network marketing

03:06.381 --> 03:08.145
This revolutionary marketing system

03:08.249 --> 03:10.150
developed in advanced countries

03:10.251 --> 03:13.346
will bring you lifelong
financial security

03:14.589 --> 03:18.492
I shall now announce
the Master of the Month

03:19.727 --> 03:21.320
Let's have a drum roll

03:21.429 --> 03:23.091
What an outstanding achievement!

03:23.231 --> 03:27.862
With 300,000 points
earned this week alone,

03:28.303 --> 03:30.329
the honor goes to Mr...

03:30.405 --> 03:32.499
- Yang Chun-dong
- Kim Jeong-sik!

03:34.042 --> 03:36.443
You're under arrest on charges of
investment and employment fraud

03:36.744 --> 03:37.768
What's going on?

03:39.414 --> 03:40.780
Remain in your seats

03:40.848 --> 03:42.612
Nobody move

04:09.577 --> 04:10.601
Get out of the way

04:13.548 --> 04:14.516
Out of my way

04:20.521 --> 04:21.656
Sneaky bastard

04:21.656 --> 04:24.683
Where do you think you're going?

04:28.796 --> 04:30.526
Who are you?

04:31.332 --> 04:33.426
I'm an undercover officer

04:33.501 --> 04:36.335
Detective Sgt. Yang
from Mapo precinct

04:36.471 --> 04:37.495
But this is Guro

04:37.572 --> 04:40.201
Let's not get hung up
on a technicality

04:40.408 --> 04:43.344
What matters is that
we got the bad guy, right?

04:43.478 --> 04:45.413
But, Master Yang...

04:47.682 --> 04:49.651
What a disgrace!

04:49.717 --> 04:52.687
A police detective involved
in a pyramid scheme?

04:52.687 --> 04:58.319
Why don't you make it
your full-time job?

04:59.160 --> 05:01.288
It's not a pyramid scheme
It's network marketing...

05:01.396 --> 05:04.366
Network marketing?!

05:04.465 --> 05:09.335
Is that why you've been selling
water dispensers to police stations?

05:10.405 --> 05:11.839
Have you learned nothing after

05:11.906 --> 05:13.875
3 years working as a detective?

05:14.042 --> 05:16.238
Are you that gullible or
just plain stupid?

05:17.745 --> 05:18.769
Ouch, hot!

05:19.747 --> 05:23.685
You should press the button
and not pull the lever

05:23.685 --> 05:26.754
Push the red button or you'll break it

05:26.754 --> 05:29.691
That's the least of your worries now

05:29.691 --> 05:34.629
Not after what you did
to our reputation

05:34.796 --> 05:37.561
Alright! Fine! Guilty as charged

05:37.699 --> 05:39.567
Is it so wrong for us

05:39.567 --> 05:40.802
to have a little side job?

05:40.802 --> 05:42.430
We depend on
a rat's ass of a wage

05:42.503 --> 05:45.530
risking our lives everyday

05:52.513 --> 05:53.572
What are you nodding about?

05:55.283 --> 05:57.377
Shouldn't we be allowed to set aside
a few bucks for our funerals?

05:57.552 --> 05:59.316
I won't hear any more of it

06:00.722 --> 06:03.692
That hurts, man

06:08.796 --> 06:11.664
You get yourself burned
because you don't listen

06:12.333 --> 06:13.357
What are you looking at?

06:14.802 --> 06:18.637
Bring in petty criminals
if you can handle it

07:15.196 --> 07:17.324
Quite an artist, aren't you?

07:17.532 --> 07:20.434
But what you're doing is illegal
You know that

07:21.302 --> 07:25.103
It's a misdemeanor
Don't let me catch you again

07:25.239 --> 07:28.334
And urinating in public isn't?

07:28.509 --> 07:29.442
What the heck, punk?

07:30.178 --> 07:33.273
Stop right there

07:33.514 --> 07:36.211
I don't appreciate your damn tone

07:37.652 --> 07:38.711
A cop?

07:42.323 --> 07:43.313
Let me see your face

07:49.530 --> 07:50.623
Hey

07:50.698 --> 07:52.690
Son of a bitch!

08:12.653 --> 08:15.623
What a fantastic end
to a spectacular day

08:15.690 --> 08:16.680
Yang

08:16.757 --> 08:18.282
You're on duty tonight?

08:18.392 --> 08:19.360
Yeah

08:22.730 --> 08:27.100
See that woman over there?
She says her child's gone missing

08:27.268 --> 08:29.430
I explained that she can only file
report after 24 hours

08:29.470 --> 08:31.371
and she wants to wait it out

08:31.472 --> 08:34.340
Have a chat with her and send her home

08:34.509 --> 08:36.477
Why should I talk to her?

08:42.750 --> 08:44.752
Ma'am,

08:44.752 --> 08:48.746
when kids don't come home
when they're expected

08:49.056 --> 08:50.922
in 80% of the cases, they return
home safely within 24 hours

08:51.225 --> 08:52.887
Detective

08:53.361 --> 08:55.296
My baby will be alright

08:55.630 --> 08:57.622
won't she, Detective?

09:01.702 --> 09:04.505
She'll be fine, right?

09:04.505 --> 09:06.633
Of course

09:07.642 --> 09:10.703
We're continuing with
a door-to-door inquiry

09:11.212 --> 09:12.475
As for the T-junction robbery,

09:13.147 --> 09:15.275
we're interviewing
the suspect's friends and family

09:15.616 --> 09:16.515
Oh, and...

09:16.584 --> 09:20.021
there was a report of a missing child
but we're ruling out

09:20.187 --> 09:23.123
- the possibility of a crime
- It could be a kidnapping

09:26.060 --> 09:28.029
What? Kidnapping?

09:28.195 --> 09:30.721
In most kidnap cases, the kidnappers
make their demands within 10 hours

09:30.898 --> 09:31.729
It clearly isn't the case here

09:31.866 --> 09:34.267
In most cases, not all of them

09:34.435 --> 09:36.301
Don't you know
what the point of kidnapping is?

09:36.437 --> 09:38.303
In 90% of the cases,
it's about money

09:38.639 --> 09:42.474
Which means the other 10%
isn't about money

09:42.610 --> 09:43.611
What are you basing
your claim on?

09:43.611 --> 09:46.547
Family issues?
Anyone holding grudge?

09:46.614 --> 09:50.484
The kid wasn't a toddler or
mentally-handicapped

09:50.484 --> 09:53.545
A perfectly healthy girl vanished
on her way home from school

09:53.621 --> 09:56.557
Shouldn't we at least
consider the possibility?

09:56.657 --> 09:59.660
Shall we set up a task force?

09:59.660 --> 10:02.663
With what budget? Manpower?

10:02.663 --> 10:05.656
Don't you know that we're
short on resources as we are?

10:07.435 --> 10:08.630
I'm just saying that

10:08.703 --> 10:10.571
a missing child is
just as important

10:10.571 --> 10:12.673
as major crime cases

10:12.673 --> 10:14.505
Who says it isn't?

10:14.575 --> 10:17.545
I'm saying that we need to prioritize

10:17.545 --> 10:20.514
Put yourself in
the shoes of the mother

10:20.514 --> 10:22.550
She lives alone with her daughter

10:22.550 --> 10:23.684
Enough!

10:23.684 --> 10:26.620
We gotta get our priorities straight

10:27.521 --> 10:28.682
That's all for the morning meeting

10:29.423 --> 10:32.526
Alright, everyone

10:32.526 --> 10:33.516
For the

10:33.628 --> 10:34.652
right of the people

10:39.533 --> 10:40.568
Yang

10:40.568 --> 10:41.627
Sir

10:48.676 --> 10:50.645
How convinced are you about this?

10:53.714 --> 10:56.912
It needs to be looked into if there is

10:57.118 --> 11:02.489
even the tiniest possibility of a crime

11:05.426 --> 11:06.485
Go for it

11:07.662 --> 11:08.595
Are you serious?

11:08.663 --> 11:09.697
I mean it

11:09.697 --> 11:12.633
It's better than having you
go around selling water dispensers

11:13.668 --> 11:16.661
As you command, Lieutenant

11:21.676 --> 11:24.512
Excuse me, ma'am

11:24.512 --> 11:25.912
<i>Have you seen this girl?
Missing</i>

11:26.213 --> 11:27.203
Sorry, I haven't

11:32.653 --> 11:36.681
Have you seen this kid
by any chance?

11:46.667 --> 11:48.659
Missing...
On the way home...

11:59.680 --> 12:02.411
I'm telling you, man

12:02.516 --> 12:03.643
I gotta take a leak

12:03.718 --> 12:06.415
- Really?
- Give me a smoke, man

12:06.487 --> 12:08.649
- That's serious shit
- We were friends before

12:39.520 --> 12:40.419
What's the matter?

12:42.523 --> 12:44.583
Block off the crowd!

12:47.461 --> 12:48.554
Take pictures there

12:56.570 --> 12:57.560
A kid turned up dead

13:03.711 --> 13:05.543
You're early

13:06.580 --> 13:08.606
It looks like she's been
dead for a while

13:08.716 --> 13:11.083
Take a look at the ankle

13:11.218 --> 13:13.119
I'm positive it's the missing girl

13:13.187 --> 13:14.155
You can't go in there

13:14.455 --> 13:16.690
I'm the officer in charge

13:16.690 --> 13:18.626
Just need to check for burn marks

13:18.626 --> 13:21.595
The cause of death will be
confirmed after the autopsy

13:21.595 --> 13:24.498
but it appears the body had been
kept frozen for a while post-mortem

13:24.498 --> 13:28.435
There's no apparent signs
of sexual assault

13:28.502 --> 13:31.666
It wasn't about money
or the act of a pedophile

13:32.006 --> 13:33.998
The killer killed her
for no reason?

13:34.241 --> 13:35.300
There are psychos like that

13:35.442 --> 13:38.276
Those that kill for
no reason or motive

13:39.513 --> 13:40.674
Eun-ji

13:40.748 --> 13:42.376
Excuse me

13:42.449 --> 13:43.417
My baby

13:43.484 --> 13:45.453
- Hey
- Don't touch me

13:45.519 --> 13:47.545
Ma'am, you can't go in there

13:48.722 --> 13:51.458
Eun-ji...

13:51.458 --> 13:53.586
Get her out of here

13:53.694 --> 13:54.662
Detective Choi

13:55.563 --> 13:56.531
Eun-ji!

13:56.597 --> 13:58.532
Ma'am, you shouldn't be here

13:58.599 --> 14:00.568
Let me find you a seat

14:01.569 --> 14:04.403
Who's in charge here?

14:05.472 --> 14:06.540
Bring her back

14:06.540 --> 14:07.564
Officer, please save my little girl

14:08.576 --> 14:12.138
She was killed then dumped
in a garbage bag

14:12.346 --> 14:14.474
only to be discovered
a month later

14:16.584 --> 14:20.021
The police didn't take the report
of her missing seriously

14:20.154 --> 14:22.020
and failed to carry out
a preliminary investigation

14:22.056 --> 14:23.991
and we haven't got a clue
about the suspects

14:24.225 --> 14:25.454
What mess did we get ourselves into?

14:26.026 --> 14:27.460
If you give us a little time...

14:27.494 --> 14:31.363
Set up a task force team
with your top men

14:31.966 --> 14:34.060
Who was in charge of the case?

14:36.237 --> 14:37.466
Suspension?

14:49.583 --> 14:52.553
Why should I be suspended?

14:52.553 --> 14:54.488
You laughed it off
when I said it was kidnapping

14:54.488 --> 14:57.458
Can someone explain?

14:57.458 --> 15:00.394
- Yang
- Get your hands off of me

15:00.461 --> 15:01.394
Yang Chun-dong

15:04.465 --> 15:06.434
You said it wasn't a kidnap case

15:13.307 --> 15:18.177
Are you gonna
take a swing at me?

15:24.551 --> 15:30.047
Let me take this case

15:30.257 --> 15:31.384
Sir

15:35.262 --> 15:37.288
You heard me

15:52.980 --> 15:54.346
I'm so sorry

16:11.565 --> 16:16.437
<i>The girl who'd been missing for 30 days
was found dead earlier today</i>

16:16.437 --> 16:19.430
<i>Her body was discovered
only 300 meters</i>

16:19.573 --> 16:22.643
<i>from her daycare center</i>

16:22.643 --> 16:26.603
<i>The police hasn't been able to
identify the motive</i>

16:26.680 --> 16:30.549
<i>other than possible links
to money or pedophilia</i>

16:33.687 --> 16:36.521
<i>According to the crime lab,
the victim's body was kept frozen</i>

16:36.790 --> 16:37.558
<i>before it was buried</i>

16:37.558 --> 16:40.494
It was way before the
crime scene was discovered

17:19.599 --> 17:21.432
Happiness

17:28.474 --> 17:29.610
Hey, stop! Stop!

17:29.610 --> 17:31.579
What do you think you're doing?

17:31.645 --> 17:33.680
What are you yelling at me for?

17:33.680 --> 17:35.649
I'm in the middle of carrying out
public service

17:35.649 --> 17:39.486
You don't understand
how important this graffiti is

17:39.486 --> 17:41.512
Did you paint this?

17:41.655 --> 17:44.420
Look at the mess you left for me

17:44.591 --> 17:48.460
You got it all wrong
I'm a police officer

17:48.529 --> 17:50.589
Let me show you

17:52.466 --> 17:54.526
Police officer, my ass

17:54.601 --> 17:57.604
Jeez... Hey!

17:57.604 --> 17:59.573
Hold that for a second

17:59.640 --> 18:00.674
Let go of me!

18:00.674 --> 18:02.576
You haven't got a clue
how important this is for me

18:02.576 --> 18:05.444
This is very important for me, too
I gotta finish this before lunch

18:05.679 --> 18:07.648
Let go of me

18:07.648 --> 18:10.550
If you're a police officer
I'm the mayor of Seoul

18:11.618 --> 18:13.644
He's wasting my lunch time.

18:19.626 --> 18:22.563
Did you take my picture?

18:22.563 --> 18:23.564
Did you take my picture just now?

18:23.564 --> 18:25.632
- Back off, lady
- What the hell did you do that for?

18:25.632 --> 18:27.430
I gotta make record
before you paint it over clean

18:27.501 --> 18:28.635
Get the camera off my face
Stop taking pictures

18:28.635 --> 18:30.126
What's wrong with you, woman?

18:30.237 --> 18:32.229
I'm hungry. That's what...
Let go of this

18:32.372 --> 18:33.362
Jeez... Woman, you're strong

18:37.644 --> 18:39.613
Get out of my way

18:39.613 --> 18:41.548
Stop it!
I'm not wearing any make-up

18:45.552 --> 18:48.689
Happiness, happiness...

18:48.689 --> 18:52.524
Where the fuck did I see it?

18:55.529 --> 18:58.465
Don't use f-word talking about happiness

19:00.467 --> 19:03.562
Go home to your mom, kid

19:08.509 --> 19:09.636
<i>Happiness</i>

19:14.481 --> 19:15.505
What?

19:16.550 --> 19:17.483
What!

19:31.298 --> 19:33.233
Hey, kid

19:35.736 --> 19:37.398
Come here

19:39.673 --> 19:43.542
Don't go anywhere
I'll be right back

19:47.681 --> 19:48.614
Here

19:51.251 --> 19:52.913
If a stranger tries to talk to you,

19:53.086 --> 19:55.351
blow it hard and loud

19:55.789 --> 19:56.882
Alright?

19:59.393 --> 20:01.385
I'm not the bad guy

20:41.235 --> 20:42.328
Jeez!

21:35.689 --> 21:37.385
<i>Kim Eun-ji</i>

22:19.599 --> 22:20.589
Son of a bitch!

22:36.583 --> 22:38.552
Did you see a man in a black cap?

22:56.536 --> 22:59.673
All these items
belonged to the victim

22:59.673 --> 23:02.743
It's quite far from her house

23:02.743 --> 23:04.711
but close to where
her body was discovered

23:04.711 --> 23:07.408
Looks like the perp found this spot

23:07.481 --> 23:09.507
on the way to bury the victim's body

23:10.584 --> 23:12.519
If the killer saw the news

23:12.586 --> 23:13.918
he might come back

23:14.020 --> 23:15.545
- to get rid of the evidence
- What the heck?

23:15.622 --> 23:18.592
How did you know about this place?

23:18.658 --> 23:19.557
How did you find out?

23:19.626 --> 23:21.561
What brings you here?

23:21.628 --> 23:23.119
You're on suspension

23:23.230 --> 23:24.528
You should be laying low

23:24.598 --> 23:27.667
I discovered this place and went inside

23:27.667 --> 23:31.705
when the bastard
in a cap attacked me

23:31.705 --> 23:34.539
What are you talking about?
We found this place

23:34.608 --> 23:37.644
What the heck, man?

23:37.644 --> 23:39.545
- Don't touch the evidence!
- Hey!

23:39.679 --> 23:43.582
The bastard hit me
over the head and got away

23:43.650 --> 23:48.622
This is the task force search area
How did you know about this place?

23:48.622 --> 23:51.558
What task force?

23:54.428 --> 23:57.398
I got something to show you
Look

23:58.498 --> 23:59.659
I got it all on camera

23:59.733 --> 24:02.464
One ballsy son of a...

24:06.106 --> 24:07.199
Is that your girlfriend?

24:07.274 --> 24:08.264
Where did it go?

24:08.408 --> 24:15.042
I'm telling you, he painted
this apartment on the wall!

24:15.182 --> 24:18.118
Get a grip, man

24:18.218 --> 24:20.414
Get a hold of yourself

24:20.654 --> 24:21.655
Son a bitch

24:21.655 --> 24:24.420
Hey! Come here

24:46.446 --> 24:48.608
<i>Seoul Art Supplies</i>

24:48.849 --> 24:50.545
Detective Yang

24:50.684 --> 24:53.381
Come on, man
You're in way over your head

24:53.453 --> 24:55.513
After all I did for you, fucking fraud

24:55.589 --> 24:58.592
Look!
A cop bashing innocent citizen

24:58.592 --> 25:01.084
I'm only playing

25:01.228 --> 25:02.355
Cheeky

25:03.563 --> 25:06.600
Come on, man
Let me borrow your car

25:06.600 --> 25:08.668
Use your own car

25:08.668 --> 25:10.470
Can't you see that I'm working?

25:10.470 --> 25:12.996
I sold it and invested the money
in the damn venture

25:13.139 --> 25:15.074
How is that my problem?

25:15.208 --> 25:17.268
I only introduced you to
a good investment opportunity

25:17.344 --> 25:20.974
Network marketing is
the way of the future

25:21.181 --> 25:24.117
Alright, alright
Just for a week

25:24.251 --> 25:26.345
No can do. I'm in a tight spot

25:26.586 --> 25:27.687
and the business is slow

25:27.687 --> 25:30.452
Have a fishcake on the house

25:33.293 --> 25:34.488
That's all you can say?

25:36.630 --> 25:37.531
Yup

25:37.531 --> 25:38.632
The hell with you

25:38.632 --> 25:39.600
Hey!

25:40.634 --> 25:41.602
See you around

25:51.645 --> 25:53.307
Would you like some more soup?

25:53.446 --> 25:54.277
Thanks

25:58.585 --> 25:59.619
Where are you going?

25:59.619 --> 26:01.588
What the...? Is it me?

26:01.655 --> 26:05.490
Damn you, Yang!

26:06.626 --> 26:08.424
You alright, man?

26:09.496 --> 26:12.432
You could've cooperated
when I asked you nicely

26:12.499 --> 26:14.491
You make me resort to violence

26:15.468 --> 26:16.959
Help me out here

26:17.103 --> 26:19.038
You know this neighborhood
like the back of your hand

26:20.440 --> 26:24.138
The guy lives on his own

26:24.344 --> 26:25.334
Where did that come from?

26:25.545 --> 26:28.105
You said the perp dumped
the poor kid in a garbage bag

26:28.248 --> 26:30.240
It means he treated
the girl like trash

26:30.350 --> 26:34.117
Why did he freeze her?

26:34.321 --> 26:38.019
When you leave food waste
lying around it stinks

26:38.058 --> 26:40.994
Most single people
freeze their food waste

26:41.161 --> 26:42.288
Don't you do that?

26:42.429 --> 26:45.399
I put mine in the food container
for delivery guys to pick up

26:45.465 --> 26:48.958
But you smart man!
That's a valid point

26:49.169 --> 26:50.137
So what you're saying is that

26:50.270 --> 26:53.138
our perp is likely to be a man
who lives alone

26:53.273 --> 26:57.233
I spent 3 years in the big house

26:57.477 --> 26:59.646
What the hell am I doing?

26:59.646 --> 27:03.683
Do you know how much reward
is at stake in this case?

27:03.683 --> 27:05.413
How much?

27:05.518 --> 27:07.453
Prepare to be impressed

27:08.455 --> 27:10.515
Fifty thousand dollars

27:11.658 --> 27:13.593
Fifty-fucking-grand?

27:14.527 --> 27:15.695
I know this art shop

27:15.695 --> 27:18.494
Go straight then take a left

27:18.565 --> 27:20.625
Run the red light
There is no camera

27:20.700 --> 27:21.668
Okay

27:23.503 --> 27:26.667
There're hundreds of college students
that use spray paint

27:27.007 --> 27:30.876
But there's got to be a few
that buy particularly a lot

27:31.044 --> 27:32.979
We're right in front of
Seoul's biggest art school

27:33.113 --> 27:34.308
There are hardly any art students

27:34.414 --> 27:36.315
who have never bought spray paint from me

27:36.449 --> 27:37.417
Mister

27:37.484 --> 27:41.285
The kids that do graffiti art,
they must buy

27:41.521 --> 27:43.581
tons of these at a time, right?

27:43.657 --> 27:45.592
Think again, please?

27:45.659 --> 27:47.494
Well

27:47.494 --> 27:52.398
There was no one in particular
that caught your attention?

27:53.033 --> 27:56.526
Now that you mention it

28:03.677 --> 28:05.543
You sent me the wrong color

28:05.645 --> 28:09.649
I ordered bright red
but you sent me brown-red

28:09.649 --> 28:13.520
It's the same color

28:13.520 --> 28:15.512
I use the Montana series

28:15.622 --> 28:18.592
Oh, the Montana series

28:20.093 --> 28:24.121
Sometimes the delivery boys
make mistakes

28:24.330 --> 28:25.389
I'm sorry about that

28:26.566 --> 28:27.625
Hey

28:28.501 --> 28:29.628
You forgot your change

28:41.681 --> 28:43.650
He gave me the creeps

28:43.650 --> 28:45.619
He sounds like our guy

28:49.723 --> 28:53.460
That's the one
That's from the Montana series

28:53.460 --> 28:55.622
You saw his face, right?
Pale complexion,

28:55.695 --> 28:57.596
face kind of longish... Right?

28:58.498 --> 28:59.632
That's right

28:59.632 --> 29:02.569
With handsome eyes and nose

29:02.569 --> 29:04.435
You have his address?

29:05.572 --> 29:08.440
Fifty thousand bucks,
fifty thousand bucks

29:08.508 --> 29:09.532
Fifty thousand bucks

29:10.677 --> 29:12.543
What... What?

29:12.645 --> 29:14.614
Wait here

29:17.484 --> 29:20.453
And whack him over the head
if he runs out, okay?

29:20.453 --> 29:21.978
This is fucking exciting

29:22.088 --> 29:24.057
- Keep your focus
- For fifty thousand bucks, sure!

30:55.448 --> 30:56.416
Yo, punk

31:10.563 --> 31:11.656
Remember me?

31:14.434 --> 31:15.458
Public urination?

31:17.503 --> 31:18.664
You do remember

31:20.240 --> 31:21.435
Happiness Apartment,
you painted it

31:22.809 --> 31:24.038
That's not all you painted

31:24.711 --> 31:28.580
You also painted where
the girl's body was buried

31:28.648 --> 31:30.241
How come all the places
in your graffiti

31:30.383 --> 31:32.750
relate back to the dead girl?

31:33.586 --> 31:34.610
The answer is

31:35.588 --> 31:37.580
because you were there

31:39.158 --> 31:41.059
Why did you kill her, motherfucker?

31:50.136 --> 31:54.005
More importantly,
why did you paint about it?

31:54.173 --> 31:57.200
You screwed yourself big time
pursuing your artistic hobby

31:57.277 --> 31:59.212
Detective Yang

31:59.445 --> 32:02.176
I think we got the wrong guy

32:03.650 --> 32:06.620
He doesn't freeze his trash

32:33.913 --> 32:38.977
How can he know
the crime scene so well?

32:39.485 --> 32:41.317
To the last detail

32:43.589 --> 32:44.613
He had an accomplice

32:54.634 --> 32:55.658
Go get him

33:18.157 --> 33:21.127
Hey man
What are you doing?

33:23.629 --> 33:25.655
Keeping yourself busy?

33:26.466 --> 33:27.559
Paint

33:27.633 --> 33:30.470
Erase

33:30.470 --> 33:32.572
Paint

33:32.572 --> 33:34.438
Erase

33:37.710 --> 33:39.440
and run

33:50.356 --> 33:51.380
Hey buddy

33:52.158 --> 33:54.218
This way is blocked, too

33:59.499 --> 34:00.592
I'm faster than you might think...

34:01.734 --> 34:03.669
That idiot...

34:03.669 --> 34:05.570
I got him!

34:08.541 --> 34:10.567
Hold his legs! Hold him down

34:10.743 --> 34:13.474
Get his cell phone!

34:13.646 --> 34:14.614
Here it is

34:14.614 --> 34:17.413
You like vintage?

34:18.451 --> 34:19.475
Check the call records

34:20.453 --> 34:23.480
There is nothing
No incoming nor outgoing calls

34:23.556 --> 34:25.422
Check the inbox

34:25.491 --> 34:26.424
Inbox... Inbox...

34:26.492 --> 34:28.016
It's cleaned out, too

34:28.094 --> 34:30.063
You just erased everything, bastard

34:30.396 --> 34:31.364
Get him up

34:35.435 --> 34:37.063
Kim Jun

34:37.203 --> 34:38.330
You must have a lot to hide

34:38.404 --> 34:41.101
covering up your
painting and text messages

34:41.574 --> 34:44.476
It's a free country

34:44.543 --> 34:46.445
Son of a bitch!

34:46.512 --> 34:48.648
There is one entry
in the address book

34:48.648 --> 34:50.446
Kim Seung-gi?

34:51.650 --> 34:53.553
Give me the phone

34:53.553 --> 34:56.489
Now you're interested?

34:56.556 --> 34:58.491
Kim Seung-gi

34:58.558 --> 34:59.582
He's your accomplice, isn't he?

35:01.461 --> 35:04.431
You don't have to answer

35:07.533 --> 35:11.471
It's Yang
Can you run an ID check?

35:11.471 --> 35:12.632
It's urgent

35:48.574 --> 35:49.598
Excuse me, Kim Seung-gi?

35:50.643 --> 35:52.441
You bastard!

36:00.453 --> 36:02.479
I'm sorry about earlier

36:02.588 --> 36:06.559
But you weren't surprised
when I grabbed you

36:06.559 --> 36:08.494
Because I've done nothing wrong

36:08.561 --> 36:10.563
Of course

36:10.563 --> 36:13.666
So you know Kim Jun
from high school?

36:13.666 --> 36:20.505
And you haven't seen him
in the last 5 years?

36:20.573 --> 36:23.600
You're high school friends
and lost touch

36:24.644 --> 36:26.545
Just friends, huh?

36:27.713 --> 36:30.478
If you're done, please leave

36:30.683 --> 36:33.653
What the hell is this about?

36:34.420 --> 36:38.658
Talking about police brutality

36:38.658 --> 36:40.693
Aren't they supposed to
protect the rights of the public?

36:40.693 --> 36:43.492
Not abuse those
by bashing up citizens

36:44.430 --> 36:45.420
Here

36:51.604 --> 36:52.594
Portrait

36:54.207 --> 36:55.300
It's really good

36:55.408 --> 36:58.970
Good as a photograph

36:59.212 --> 37:01.078
Did you draw it yourself?

37:01.447 --> 37:02.847
Kim Jun

37:09.422 --> 37:10.390
Take it

37:13.659 --> 37:15.525
What, man?

37:17.396 --> 37:18.455
Fraud

37:19.398 --> 37:21.367
Frauds can be cops these days?

37:22.568 --> 37:24.594
That's quite a rap sheet you've got

37:24.670 --> 37:27.572
You make a great sidekick

37:27.640 --> 37:29.632
What are you?

37:33.279 --> 37:37.182
You really haven't seen him
in 5 years?

37:37.250 --> 37:39.219
How can I when he's in America?

37:39.385 --> 37:40.353
America?

37:42.622 --> 37:44.420
What the hell happened?

37:45.691 --> 37:47.387
What happened, man?

37:47.460 --> 37:50.396
Hey! Wake up

37:50.463 --> 37:51.564
Come on! Open your eyes

37:51.564 --> 37:52.623
Where did he go?

37:55.601 --> 37:56.591
Where'd he go?

37:56.669 --> 37:59.400
Where the fuck is he?

37:59.538 --> 38:02.575
That kid is weird
He's a freak

38:02.575 --> 38:05.511
Are you high or something?

38:22.728 --> 38:25.630
<i>Attempted kidnapping
All officers report to station</i>

38:28.567 --> 38:29.669
Detective Yang

38:29.669 --> 38:33.572
What did he say to you?

38:33.572 --> 38:37.576
He said that I was pretty

38:37.576 --> 38:42.648
and that his puppy was sick
He asked me if I could watch it

38:42.648 --> 38:45.482
He told me to get in the car

38:46.552 --> 38:49.622
So what did you do, sweetie?
Did you get in the car?

38:49.622 --> 38:52.490
No, because something wasn't right

38:54.527 --> 38:56.496
The puppy

38:59.665 --> 39:02.430
It was frozen

39:26.058 --> 39:27.048
Hey, kid

39:28.561 --> 39:29.529
Yes?

39:30.896 --> 39:32.159
Can you come here for a second?

39:37.636 --> 39:38.660
Why?

39:39.405 --> 39:42.341
My puppy seems to be sick

39:42.375 --> 39:46.312
I was wondering if you could
watch him for a while

39:46.445 --> 39:49.381
Is he very sick?

39:49.582 --> 39:53.576
Yeah... He's acting weird

39:53.652 --> 39:56.520
He seems to have no energy

40:02.628 --> 40:04.563
Wanna come around
and take a look?

40:06.499 --> 40:07.592
Come on

40:17.710 --> 40:19.576
You can take a closer look

40:21.614 --> 40:22.673
Touch it if you want to

41:59.512 --> 42:00.571
Daddy

42:01.480 --> 42:02.573
What?

42:03.482 --> 42:06.652
Someone was chasing me

42:06.652 --> 42:09.554
What? Who?

42:09.622 --> 42:11.457
Who the fuck?

42:11.457 --> 42:13.688
Who's there?

42:14.426 --> 42:16.554
There is nothing for you
to take from this shit hole

42:16.629 --> 42:18.621
Motherfuckers

42:21.734 --> 42:26.399
There's nobody

42:26.472 --> 42:29.642
You little lying bitch

42:29.642 --> 42:30.666
Where is my booze?

42:31.610 --> 42:34.546
You used the money for yourself,
didn't you?

42:34.613 --> 42:35.714
No

42:35.714 --> 42:38.548
Hell no! Sneaky little bitch

42:38.617 --> 42:40.586
- I didn't
- Don't lie to me

42:40.586 --> 42:42.452
I'm telling the truth

42:53.499 --> 42:55.468
Go out and get me my booze

43:58.697 --> 43:59.665
It was roughly 1 am?

43:59.665 --> 44:01.600
I'm not sure about the time

44:01.600 --> 44:03.469
This neighborhood goes
totally dark at night

44:03.469 --> 44:04.637
Anything else you remember?

44:04.637 --> 44:06.435
- The kid's father was...
- Excuse me

44:06.505 --> 44:08.531
complaining all night that
she wasn't bringing back booze

44:08.674 --> 44:10.542
That shoe

44:10.542 --> 44:14.638
That shoe and the whistle
were on the ground

44:17.516 --> 44:19.652
She wasn't taken by nobody

44:19.652 --> 44:22.383
It doesn't make sense

44:22.454 --> 44:27.459
What could a kidnapper
want from me?

44:27.459 --> 44:31.624
Cut out the fuss and go back
She'll come back

44:31.697 --> 44:33.465
Get flyers distributed

44:33.465 --> 44:34.433
Yes, sir

44:35.701 --> 44:37.431
What's the matter?

44:42.708 --> 44:43.676
What?

44:43.676 --> 44:44.643
Damn it

44:44.643 --> 44:46.544
- What's wrong? Hey!
- Hey! Yang!

44:49.448 --> 44:51.650
Gas and water will be
cut off in a few days

44:51.650 --> 44:53.686
I'll leave the papers for you

44:53.686 --> 44:57.384
We'll have no choice
but to enforce eviction

45:04.496 --> 45:06.465
I said I don't need your help

45:08.534 --> 45:11.537
Let's suppose
you didn't kill the girl

45:11.537 --> 45:13.706
You must know
where she is being held

45:13.706 --> 45:15.641
Tell me, you son of a bitch

45:18.677 --> 45:19.667
Tell me now

45:24.650 --> 45:27.779
How did you
paint the graffiti? Explain

45:28.087 --> 45:31.114
I painted from imagination

45:32.458 --> 45:34.552
That's it!
I'll kill you with my own hands

45:35.060 --> 45:38.053
Go ahead. Do it

45:46.538 --> 45:47.471
Son of a bitch

45:49.441 --> 45:51.467
A kid's life is hanging by a thread

45:51.543 --> 45:52.636
and you painted from imagination?

45:54.480 --> 45:55.504
Where is she?

45:55.714 --> 45:58.445
Answer me, damn it

45:58.517 --> 45:59.507
Answer me

46:03.555 --> 46:05.456
Get up on your feet, bastard

46:05.657 --> 46:06.556
Get up

46:07.693 --> 46:10.527
Tell me
Tell me now

46:18.704 --> 46:20.639
Is that what this is all about?

46:20.706 --> 46:21.935
What did you say?

46:22.040 --> 46:24.134
You think that if you
find the missing kids,

46:24.243 --> 46:26.303
your brother will
come back from dead?

46:29.648 --> 46:31.412
Cute name

46:32.551 --> 46:33.575
Gi-dong

46:37.523 --> 46:38.547
Yang Gi-dong

46:50.636 --> 46:52.502
Wait up, Chun-dong

46:56.475 --> 46:57.602
Wait up, Chun-dong

46:58.577 --> 47:00.512
Can I tag along?

47:00.579 --> 47:02.514
Can I tag along?

47:03.582 --> 47:06.575
Stay here and play with your toy

47:07.586 --> 47:09.418
Take me with you

47:09.621 --> 47:11.590
Take me with you

47:12.491 --> 47:15.518
Chun-dong, take me with you

47:15.594 --> 47:17.654
<i>Chun-dong</i>

47:56.635 --> 47:58.433
Gi-dong

47:58.637 --> 48:00.435
Gi-dong

48:00.706 --> 48:02.538
Gi-dong

48:02.741 --> 48:04.505
Gi-dong

49:06.138 --> 49:08.607
Don't pick at the scab
or it'll get infected. Okay?

49:16.615 --> 49:20.575
<i>Missing</i>

49:47.012 --> 49:51.245
I rarely do 'thinking'

49:51.316 --> 49:56.254
Pretending to be thinking
is so hard

49:56.421 --> 49:57.480
Let's take five

49:57.622 --> 50:00.456
Don't move, mister

50:01.193 --> 50:04.095
Don't call me that
Call me 'big brother'

50:04.296 --> 50:06.458
Only old men like to
be called 'big brother'

50:08.700 --> 50:11.499
Listen to me carefully
while you're drawing

50:12.604 --> 50:16.608
You're walking on the street

50:16.608 --> 50:19.644
and some guy pulls up
and asks you to help him

50:19.644 --> 50:20.668
What do you do?

50:21.213 --> 50:23.341
- Help him
- Don't help him

50:25.150 --> 50:28.348
You should never
get in the car, okay?

50:29.021 --> 50:31.115
You should never help him either

50:31.189 --> 50:33.055
Why? Because you're kids

50:33.158 --> 50:35.184
Kids don't have to help adults

50:35.260 --> 50:38.162
So, you should never
try to help them. Okay?

50:38.263 --> 50:39.390
Yeah

50:39.498 --> 50:41.262
I can't hear you

50:41.400 --> 50:43.301
Yes

50:47.139 --> 50:49.267
I don't have long to talk, Detective

50:49.574 --> 50:52.544
Let me ask you one question

50:56.581 --> 50:59.949
What do you think about this picture?

51:00.152 --> 51:04.146
It's an bird's-eye-view image
painted from imagination

51:04.289 --> 51:06.190
Imagination?

51:06.324 --> 51:07.155
Yes

51:07.259 --> 51:11.094
This composition
couldn't have been possible

51:11.196 --> 51:13.256
unless he was looking down
from the sky

51:22.040 --> 51:23.633
Where did you get that picture?

51:23.708 --> 51:27.440
It's a depiction of the crime scene
where the missing girl's body was discovered

51:27.679 --> 51:29.581
Are you surprised?

51:29.581 --> 51:31.607
What you would find
more surprising is that

51:33.452 --> 51:35.554
Kim Jun painted this long before

51:35.554 --> 51:38.524
the crime scene was
discovered by the police

51:39.591 --> 51:41.560
Kim Jun?

51:41.626 --> 51:44.563
You didn't know

51:44.563 --> 51:47.431
He never went to America

51:59.678 --> 52:02.409
I lost my little brother
when I was younger

52:03.482 --> 52:07.419
I never told anyone about it

52:08.653 --> 52:11.452
but Jun knew about it

52:12.491 --> 52:15.427
I decided to become a police officer
after I lost my brother

52:17.462 --> 52:18.657
You know

52:19.464 --> 52:23.492
I'm a detective with
the worst performance record

52:23.602 --> 52:25.503
but one thing I know for sure

52:26.538 --> 52:29.599
is that another child will
never be lost on my watch

52:30.575 --> 52:36.412
In order to do that,
I must know what Jun knows

52:36.515 --> 52:38.609
I have to know that
to save the missing children

52:48.727 --> 52:50.525
Hey, emo!

52:51.530 --> 52:53.658
They tell me you do freaky tricks

52:57.569 --> 52:58.628
Something to do with your hand

52:58.703 --> 53:01.606
See things by touching
Is that right?

53:01.606 --> 53:03.507
Show me what you do

53:06.111 --> 53:07.272
Didn't you hear me, punk?

53:07.379 --> 53:09.348
I'm asking you nicely, aren't I?

53:11.049 --> 53:12.073
That's enough

53:12.250 --> 53:13.411
What the fuck are you looking at, freak?

53:13.552 --> 53:15.350
What do you think you're doing?

53:16.588 --> 53:20.525
Will you give it a rest
before I call the teacher?

53:22.527 --> 53:25.564
This is hilarious

53:25.564 --> 53:27.590
Tell your teacher on me

53:27.666 --> 53:30.500
Go on, bitch

53:35.674 --> 53:37.506
Piss pants

53:37.576 --> 53:38.577
What?

53:38.577 --> 53:40.579
You went to middle school in Busan

53:40.579 --> 53:43.481
You pissed in your pants
and got bullied for 3 years

53:43.548 --> 53:45.540
Begged your parents
to transfer you to a new school

53:46.685 --> 53:48.517
What the fuck, freak?

53:48.587 --> 53:50.385
Want me to say more?

53:51.523 --> 53:55.483
<i>Jun had a special ability</i>

53:55.560 --> 53:56.528
<i>A special ability?</i>

53:56.528 --> 53:57.621
<i>Supernatural powers</i>

54:05.670 --> 54:07.571
<i>Ability to see the past</i>

54:17.449 --> 54:19.611
<i>Psychometry</i>

54:20.518 --> 54:24.478
An ability to see memory or information

54:24.556 --> 54:27.526
entombed in an object
through physical contact

54:32.631 --> 54:34.657
Psychometry

54:38.670 --> 54:42.505
<i>Not long after the incident,
Jun left school</i>

54:42.574 --> 54:44.576
<i>and we lost touch</i>

54:44.576 --> 54:46.711
<i>You haven't seen him since?</i>

54:46.711 --> 54:49.547
<i>Did you hear anything about him?</i>

54:49.547 --> 54:52.550
<i>I heard there was an accident</i>

54:52.550 --> 54:53.540
<i>An accident?</i>

54:59.691 --> 55:00.681
That's right

55:03.595 --> 55:05.427
I see things, too

55:06.698 --> 55:08.566
But don't worry

55:08.566 --> 55:11.559
I won't kill myself like dad did

55:11.636 --> 55:13.662
Let's talk about this later

55:13.738 --> 55:16.474
After I get off work, okay?

55:16.474 --> 55:17.601
What work?

55:17.676 --> 55:21.477
You mean selling smiles to men?

55:22.180 --> 55:24.581
I told you that's not what I do

55:24.683 --> 55:26.584
Then give me your hand

55:26.651 --> 55:28.687
- Don't do this to me
- Give me your hand

55:28.687 --> 55:30.417
Go on

55:32.624 --> 55:35.594
Why can't you hold my hand?

55:38.163 --> 55:39.324
Do I scare you, too?

55:43.702 --> 55:44.635
Mom...

56:49.601 --> 56:51.467
Good morning

56:57.509 --> 56:58.602
Hey

57:08.620 --> 57:12.523
Let's put hard feelings aside
and talk this out

57:12.690 --> 57:14.625
I've got nothing to say to you
Piss off

57:16.628 --> 57:17.618
Psychometry

57:21.599 --> 57:26.504
I don't care if you're a psychic
or an alien or God-knows-what

57:26.504 --> 57:28.473
But I know that

57:28.473 --> 57:30.601
you're not lying

57:35.180 --> 57:39.242
Hey, I really envy your ability

57:39.584 --> 57:42.452
I'd buy it off you if I could

57:42.620 --> 57:46.557
It'll make my job
a whole lot easier

57:50.695 --> 57:52.459
Kim Jun

57:53.465 --> 57:55.667
Who doesn't have
a story from the past?

57:55.667 --> 57:58.398
Don't be melodramatic

58:00.705 --> 58:04.608
How long will you confine yourself
in this dark hole?

58:05.610 --> 58:07.408
You're wasting your life away

58:08.713 --> 58:10.579
Do you have any friends?

58:11.616 --> 58:13.448
Ever been in a relationship?

58:15.420 --> 58:18.413
A prickly bastard like you
can't have been in a relationship

58:20.525 --> 58:25.691
What happened to your mother
wasn't your fault

58:26.064 --> 58:28.226
It was an accident and
you know that

58:28.366 --> 58:31.165
How long will you live in the past?

58:34.105 --> 58:38.008
I'm sure your mother
would be real proud of you

58:45.617 --> 58:47.609
What the fuck do you think you know?

58:57.262 --> 58:59.231
I said I don't need your money

58:59.330 --> 59:02.266
You're home today, Mr. Kim

59:02.333 --> 59:03.426
You know it's your last day

59:03.535 --> 59:06.300
Let's just get this done
and over with

59:07.505 --> 59:08.666
Hey...

59:11.676 --> 59:13.611
Punk

59:13.678 --> 59:16.546
Why couldn't you just
move out quietly?

59:16.614 --> 59:17.582
Get out of the way

59:21.452 --> 59:23.488
Sign with your thumbprint

59:23.488 --> 59:25.582
Don't fight it

59:28.626 --> 59:30.628
I would think twice
about touching his hand

59:30.628 --> 59:32.664
Who the hell are you?

59:32.664 --> 59:33.597
Me?

59:33.665 --> 59:34.655
I'm his big brother

59:37.735 --> 59:39.537
Get up

59:39.537 --> 59:40.561
Fuck!

59:44.709 --> 59:47.440
Don't get smart with me

59:49.480 --> 59:51.616
Since when have
civil servants been

59:51.616 --> 59:54.415
so dedicated to their jobs?

01:00:01.659 --> 01:00:04.458
Sneaky son of a bitch
Motherfucker!

01:00:10.702 --> 01:00:11.670
Get up

01:00:14.639 --> 01:00:15.663
I said get up

01:00:18.476 --> 01:00:19.444
You think it's funny?

01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:20.603
Hilarious

01:00:29.621 --> 01:00:30.645
Son of a bitch!

01:00:32.657 --> 01:00:33.658
Get the hell out of here

01:00:33.658 --> 01:00:36.594
Get the fuck out of here
Fucking bastards

01:00:39.464 --> 01:00:40.432
Fucking thugs

01:00:46.738 --> 01:00:48.539
Hey

01:00:48.539 --> 01:00:49.707
You alright?

01:00:49.707 --> 01:00:51.542
I'm okay, I'm okay

01:00:51.542 --> 01:00:52.669
You alright, man?

01:00:54.679 --> 01:00:58.683
Just a little tired, that's all

01:00:58.683 --> 01:01:03.688
Let's talk later
I'm out of here

01:01:03.688 --> 01:01:05.452
I'm just gonna go...

01:01:05.523 --> 01:01:06.616
Hey! Hey!

01:01:39.457 --> 01:01:40.447
Eun-ji!

01:01:58.710 --> 01:02:00.474
I just saw

01:02:03.448 --> 01:02:05.440
Girls' Generation

01:02:06.584 --> 01:02:07.643
I know

01:02:10.655 --> 01:02:13.648
It's been a while since
someone made ramen for me

01:02:20.498 --> 01:02:23.491
Just the wayl like it

01:02:24.469 --> 01:02:25.528
Got any kimchi?

01:02:27.472 --> 01:02:29.634
I'm asking too much of you

01:02:31.576 --> 01:02:33.636
How can I help?

01:02:44.555 --> 01:02:46.524
It's not like I can see everything

01:02:47.658 --> 01:02:51.527
Because memories fade

01:02:54.465 --> 01:02:58.469
But some things stay with you
for a long time

01:02:58.469 --> 01:03:00.529
It puts a strain
on my body afterwards

01:03:01.572 --> 01:03:03.404
How did you know
about the crime scene?

01:03:03.474 --> 01:03:05.534
Did you touch something?

01:03:18.556 --> 01:03:20.525
I touch these guys

01:03:20.591 --> 01:03:23.584
I can see some of the things
they saw

01:03:25.463 --> 01:03:27.398
A bird's-eye-view, of course

01:03:31.602 --> 01:03:35.640
Summoning pigeons,
is that one of your special powers?

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:37.541
Anyone can do this

01:03:37.608 --> 01:03:38.598
Really?

01:03:38.709 --> 01:03:40.575
After practicing for about 4 years

01:03:43.714 --> 01:03:47.378
Why didn't you report it
to the police?

01:03:48.486 --> 01:03:51.650
And tell them what?

01:03:52.423 --> 01:03:54.483
Well, you know...

01:03:54.559 --> 01:03:56.687
Do you think they'll take me seriously?

01:04:01.065 --> 01:04:04.126
So, you painted it on the wall

01:04:04.335 --> 01:04:06.304
hoping somebody would see it

01:04:14.712 --> 01:04:16.510
Can I have some privacy?

01:04:44.876 --> 01:04:45.910
Touch it if you want to

01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:47.469
Kim Eun-ji

01:04:58.489 --> 01:05:01.482
Little fox, little fox

01:05:17.575 --> 01:05:19.669
Hey! Hey!

01:05:19.744 --> 01:05:22.513
Wake up, man

01:05:22.513 --> 01:05:24.414
Hey!

01:05:25.416 --> 01:05:26.406
What's happening?

01:05:26.684 --> 01:05:28.619
Let go
Let it go

01:05:34.725 --> 01:05:36.523
Get me some paper

01:05:37.595 --> 01:05:41.532
We tracked down
a specific model of freezer

01:05:41.532 --> 01:05:44.635
matching the mark left on the body

01:05:44.635 --> 01:05:46.604
These large capacity freezers are
for commercial use

01:05:46.604 --> 01:05:48.673
typically used by caterers,
meat packers and the like

01:05:48.673 --> 01:05:50.708
We'll start with visiting
relevant businesses...

01:05:50.708 --> 01:05:52.677
You're kidding, right?

01:05:52.677 --> 01:05:55.446
When every second is crucial

01:05:55.446 --> 01:05:57.548
Get out of here
Detective Park

01:05:57.548 --> 01:05:59.550
Come on, man

01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:00.609
Sir

01:06:00.751 --> 01:06:03.653
I think we should confine
the search to daycare centers

01:06:03.688 --> 01:06:07.489
Didn't you hear me
telling you to leave?

01:06:07.558 --> 01:06:09.560
I'm talking, for crying out loud!

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.493
You little piece of shit!

01:06:10.561 --> 01:06:11.529
Stop

01:06:11.595 --> 01:06:13.496
Stop messing around in here

01:06:14.598 --> 01:06:17.435
I'm not talking out of my ass

01:06:17.435 --> 01:06:19.503
Please hear me out

01:06:19.503 --> 01:06:21.563
Han! Let him speak

01:06:24.508 --> 01:06:25.532
Go on

01:06:28.512 --> 01:06:31.482
I'm just coming back from the lab

01:06:31.482 --> 01:06:33.451
I hear nursery rhymes

01:06:33.517 --> 01:06:35.519
Also children's giggle

01:06:35.519 --> 01:06:37.579
I see balls

01:06:37.655 --> 01:06:39.557
Colorful balls

01:06:39.557 --> 01:06:41.559
According to the analysis,
they discovered

01:06:41.559 --> 01:06:44.495
traces of polycarbonate
from the victim's clothes

01:06:44.495 --> 01:06:47.556
The sort that can be found in

01:06:47.631 --> 01:06:50.701
play balls you see in ball pools

01:06:50.701 --> 01:06:52.536
But

01:06:52.536 --> 01:06:54.664
she may have been to a play room
before she got snatched

01:06:55.006 --> 01:06:55.564
No

01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:57.575
I talked to the mother

01:06:57.575 --> 01:06:59.610
The vic had a severe atopic allergy

01:06:59.610 --> 01:07:01.612
and she was kept away from plastic

01:07:01.612 --> 01:07:03.481
The only explanation is that

01:07:03.481 --> 01:07:05.507
she came in contact with these balls
after she was kidnapped

01:07:05.583 --> 01:07:09.720
We can deduce from
the facts we gathered

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:13.524
that the kidnapper owns
a large capacity commercial freezer

01:07:13.524 --> 01:07:15.493
and runs some sort of play facility

01:07:15.493 --> 01:07:18.520
Who has both these thing?

01:07:18.596 --> 01:07:20.462
That's why l'm suggesting

01:07:20.531 --> 01:07:22.533
we start with daycare centers

01:07:22.533 --> 01:07:26.470
Furthermore, in child-related crimes

01:07:26.537 --> 01:07:28.706
perps are likely to keep
recordings of the crime

01:07:28.706 --> 01:07:31.574
as a trophy

01:07:31.742 --> 01:07:35.543
I suggest we check
he suspect's cellphones, too

01:07:35.713 --> 01:07:37.443
Yang

01:07:37.615 --> 01:07:38.605
Yes, sir

01:07:38.682 --> 01:07:40.548
Are you sure about this?

01:07:46.624 --> 01:07:48.559
Are you really sure?

01:07:48.559 --> 01:07:49.686
Yes, sir

01:07:50.494 --> 01:07:51.655
I'm sure this time

01:07:54.498 --> 01:07:57.491
Fine. We'll take Yang's angle

01:07:58.636 --> 01:08:00.538
Get moving

01:08:00.538 --> 01:08:02.540
Yes, sir

01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:04.475
Come on
Every second counts

01:08:13.651 --> 01:08:14.641
Detective Yang

01:08:15.653 --> 01:08:18.589
Do you know what time it is?
What took you so long?

01:08:18.589 --> 01:08:20.490
- You're sure this time?
- Get moving

01:08:21.725 --> 01:08:23.523
- Is this the place?
- Come on

01:08:25.529 --> 01:08:27.564
We're investigating
a case of a missing girl

01:08:27.564 --> 01:08:28.599
May we see your freezer?

01:08:28.599 --> 01:08:31.591
- Mind if I see your cellphone?
- Here

01:08:39.542 --> 01:08:40.475
Thank you

01:08:41.511 --> 01:08:44.582
We don't mess with the food we feed
to the children in our care

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:46.448
Thank you for your time

01:08:50.554 --> 01:08:54.457
You screwed me again

01:09:01.499 --> 01:09:03.661
Detective Yang

01:09:03.734 --> 01:09:05.566
If you're gonna complain
Go home

01:09:05.636 --> 01:09:08.572
Plastic balls and freezer

01:09:08.572 --> 01:09:10.666
They're not just in daycare centers

01:09:11.642 --> 01:09:12.710
Look

01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:15.578
<i>Barbecue
Kiddie ball pool</i>

01:09:18.482 --> 01:09:21.452
Good evening! A table for two?

01:09:21.618 --> 01:09:25.488
Sir, you can't go in there
with your shoes on

01:09:25.488 --> 01:09:27.457
We're from the police

01:09:30.361 --> 01:09:33.194
They have a freezer
of the same model

01:09:34.631 --> 01:09:36.567
What is it you're looking for?

01:09:37.568 --> 01:09:38.591
Can we speak to your boss?

01:09:38.669 --> 01:09:40.604
He's not here yet

01:09:40.671 --> 01:09:42.572
When is he coming in?

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.438
He should be here soon

01:09:44.508 --> 01:09:46.533
So when?

01:09:48.578 --> 01:09:50.548
Well.. There he comes

01:10:00.624 --> 01:10:02.459
Can I help?

01:10:02.459 --> 01:10:04.121
Are you the owner of this restaurant?

01:10:04.261 --> 01:10:06.230
- Can I see your cellphone?
- What's this regarding?

01:10:06.397 --> 01:10:09.390
I'm from Mapo precinct
We're investigating a case

01:10:09.633 --> 01:10:11.397
My cellphone?

01:10:12.203 --> 01:10:14.172
It's in the car
Let me get it for you

01:10:16.173 --> 01:10:18.165
- Want one?
- I'm good

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.583
Hey, hey!

01:10:25.583 --> 01:10:26.650
Open the door

01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:28.414
Open the goddamn door

01:10:31.422 --> 01:10:32.617
Son of a bitch!

01:10:44.668 --> 01:10:46.569
- Yang-su!
- I got it

01:10:58.449 --> 01:11:00.384
Fifty grand, man

01:11:00.451 --> 01:11:01.612
Jeez, man

01:11:04.622 --> 01:11:06.457
Where is she?

01:11:06.457 --> 01:11:08.692
Who are you talking about?

01:11:08.692 --> 01:11:11.457
What girl?

01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:14.665
Don't get smart with me

01:11:14.665 --> 01:11:15.633
What the...?

01:11:16.667 --> 01:11:19.398
Hey! Let go of this

01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:20.563
Let him go

01:11:21.672 --> 01:11:23.538
What are you talking about?

01:11:23.607 --> 01:11:26.042
He was abroad
when the victim went missing

01:11:26.176 --> 01:11:28.236
We've been shooting canons
to catch a fly

01:11:28.412 --> 01:11:30.278
I mobilized a whole damn division

01:11:30.381 --> 01:11:33.249
What am I supposed
to tell them upstairs?

01:11:33.384 --> 01:11:34.317
Lieutenant

01:11:36.553 --> 01:11:38.454
We have a problem

01:11:38.555 --> 01:11:41.692
<i>The mother of the missing girl</i>

01:11:41.692 --> 01:11:45.429
<i>who was recently discovered dead</i>

01:11:45.429 --> 01:11:47.631
<i>has taken her own life</i>

01:11:47.631 --> 01:11:51.534
<i>It was reported that the deceased had
been suffering from severe depression</i>

01:11:51.602 --> 01:11:53.971
<i>The shock of the recent tragedy</i>

01:11:53.971 --> 01:11:56.507
<i>may have driven her
to take extreme measures</i>

01:11:56.507 --> 01:11:59.476
<i>The kidnap-murder victim
had gone missing on April 17</i>

01:11:59.476 --> 01:12:02.378
<i>on her way home from daycare</i>

01:12:02.446 --> 01:12:05.439
<i>Her body was discovered
in a nearby playground</i>

01:12:05.549 --> 01:12:07.643
<i>3 weeks after
she was reported missing</i>

01:12:07.718 --> 01:12:10.487
<i>The police were criticized for
initially ruling out kidnapping</i>

01:12:10.487 --> 01:12:13.514
The kidnap story's
on the news all day

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:15.626
Scary world we're living in

01:12:15.626 --> 01:12:16.650
It really is

01:12:16.727 --> 01:12:20.687
<i>The police is yet to come up
with a breakthrough</i>

01:12:21.432 --> 01:12:22.766
<i>in the case of the missing girl</i>

01:12:22.766 --> 01:12:25.202
<i>believed to be the work
of the same kidnapper</i>

01:12:25.202 --> 01:12:26.970
<i>With inadequate response</i>

01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:28.672
<i>in the crucial early stages
of the investigation,</i>

01:12:28.672 --> 01:12:31.665
<i>it will be hard for the police
to escape blame...</i>

01:12:42.553 --> 01:12:44.579
Good morning

01:12:47.624 --> 01:12:49.616
You're really getting
back on your feet

01:12:49.693 --> 01:12:51.389
Come here

01:12:53.464 --> 01:12:56.633
Oh no! Are you okay?

01:12:56.633 --> 01:12:59.603
I'm alright

01:13:00.671 --> 01:13:04.438
What did you do with the remains
of the euthanized animals?

01:13:04.508 --> 01:13:07.644
I processed them as medical waste

01:13:07.644 --> 01:13:08.612
Good

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:11.572
You can leave, now

01:13:11.648 --> 01:13:13.378
Yes, doctor

01:14:00.631 --> 01:14:01.621
Yang

01:14:01.698 --> 01:14:05.533
Is their something
you're not telling me?

01:14:07.738 --> 01:14:10.606
What are you talking about?

01:14:11.642 --> 01:14:14.445
I spoke with the lab yesterday

01:14:14.445 --> 01:14:16.613
You never went there

01:14:16.613 --> 01:14:19.583
What's more surprising is that
they processed the vic's clothes

01:14:19.650 --> 01:14:23.553
and found a trace of polycarbonate

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:27.421
How did you know about that
even before the lab found out?

01:14:28.492 --> 01:14:32.429
I consulted a private facility...

01:14:37.601 --> 01:14:39.570
Yang

01:14:39.636 --> 01:14:41.605
There is something I gotta say

01:14:41.605 --> 01:14:44.708
I saw you in the apartment
basement the other day

01:14:44.708 --> 01:14:47.576
You were running after someone
and your shoe came off

01:14:47.644 --> 01:14:50.546
I know that you were first to discover the scene

01:14:51.482 --> 01:14:52.575
Cut it out

01:14:53.417 --> 01:14:54.612
It's all in the past, right?

01:15:01.625 --> 01:15:03.560
What I want to know is

01:15:03.627 --> 01:15:06.654
how you knew about all this

01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:11.532
You had such strong conviction
about the daycare angle

01:15:15.706 --> 01:15:20.667
A lot of heads are on the line here

01:15:21.645 --> 01:15:24.513
My twins are going
to college this year

01:15:24.615 --> 01:15:27.414
and Han's set a date for his wedding

01:15:28.418 --> 01:15:29.442
Yang

01:15:32.623 --> 01:15:34.455
So tell us

01:15:34.525 --> 01:15:37.654
Where did you get
all this information?

01:15:42.699 --> 01:15:44.600
Yang Chun-dong

01:15:44.668 --> 01:15:46.603
Are you gonna let this kid die?

01:15:53.544 --> 01:15:54.637
Promise me

01:15:55.712 --> 01:15:57.578
that you'll never try to find me

01:15:57.648 --> 01:15:59.640
or tell anyone about me

01:16:04.688 --> 01:16:06.452
Give me your phone

01:16:08.625 --> 01:16:10.526
Give it to me

01:16:10.627 --> 01:16:12.619
What are you doing?

01:16:21.672 --> 01:16:23.674
Call me if anything happens

01:16:23.674 --> 01:16:25.666
Call me even if nothing happens, okay?

01:16:28.478 --> 01:16:30.447
<i>Thanx for today, bro.
I'll buy you a big dinner</i>

01:16:30.447 --> 01:16:32.439
<i>when we find her</i>

01:16:34.618 --> 01:16:38.487
<i>Did you catch the kidnapper?</i>

01:16:41.558 --> 01:16:42.582
Kim Jun

01:16:44.461 --> 01:16:45.520
Get him

01:16:47.664 --> 01:16:48.654
Stay still

01:16:56.673 --> 01:16:59.676
What? Psychometry?

01:16:59.676 --> 01:17:02.512
What do you think
you're talking about?

01:17:02.512 --> 01:17:04.481
You got tricked into some
absurd scam again?

01:17:04.548 --> 01:17:07.518
He's not a suspect
How many times do I have to tell you?

01:17:07.618 --> 01:17:12.420
We gotta get him to talk about
how he knows about the crime scene

01:17:12.489 --> 01:17:13.557
Lieutenant,

01:17:13.557 --> 01:17:16.652
he could be putting on a show
after killing them all

01:17:17.728 --> 01:17:20.630
Just leave this to me, will you?

01:17:44.621 --> 01:17:46.487
I'm sorry about this

01:17:58.669 --> 01:18:00.535
Can you touch these?

01:18:07.678 --> 01:18:10.480
You've got no choice

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.972
You can't get out of here

01:18:13.216 --> 01:18:15.208
unless you give us information

01:18:19.656 --> 01:18:20.624
Come on

01:18:24.661 --> 01:18:25.629
Touch it

01:18:26.663 --> 01:18:28.393
Touch what?

01:18:29.666 --> 01:18:32.465
Do that thing that you showed me

01:18:32.569 --> 01:18:34.435
What did I show you?

01:18:35.472 --> 01:18:36.531
Don't mess with me

01:18:44.448 --> 01:18:45.472
Touch it

01:18:52.656 --> 01:18:55.455
We're running out of time

01:18:55.525 --> 01:18:58.518
You're different from us
You can do this

01:19:01.431 --> 01:19:04.526
You're right. I'm different

01:19:06.670 --> 01:19:08.571
I'm a monster

01:19:11.708 --> 01:19:15.406
What do you want to see?

01:19:17.514 --> 01:19:18.538
This?

01:19:24.488 --> 01:19:26.389
What the hell is he doing?

01:19:27.457 --> 01:19:29.619
It's okay.
He's supposed to do that

01:19:39.703 --> 01:19:40.671
What do you see?

01:19:45.542 --> 01:19:46.532
What the...?

01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:48.512
What's wrong?

01:19:48.512 --> 01:19:49.502
What's going on?

01:19:51.581 --> 01:19:52.480
Jun...

01:19:54.584 --> 01:19:55.517
Let go

01:19:55.585 --> 01:19:57.611
Let it go, man

01:19:57.687 --> 01:20:00.623
I said, let go!

01:20:01.691 --> 01:20:02.659
Let it go

01:20:05.462 --> 01:20:06.657
Jun! Jun!

01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:08.454
Wake up, man

01:20:08.532 --> 01:20:09.556
Wake up

01:20:09.666 --> 01:20:11.568
Come on

01:20:11.568 --> 01:20:12.501
Jun

01:20:12.569 --> 01:20:13.737
What are you doing?

01:20:13.737 --> 01:20:16.473
Let it go, man

01:20:16.473 --> 01:20:18.465
You're gonna die!

01:20:22.512 --> 01:20:24.915
Hey!

01:20:24.915 --> 01:20:25.883
Jun

01:20:30.854 --> 01:20:32.686
Did you see something?

01:20:32.756 --> 01:20:33.883
You saw something, didn't you?

01:20:35.926 --> 01:20:38.623
Idiots

01:20:39.896 --> 01:20:41.592
What?

01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:44.890
See what?

01:20:48.872 --> 01:20:50.704
You're a bunch of morons
for letting me fool you

01:20:52.642 --> 01:20:54.736
Fine

01:20:56.746 --> 01:20:57.848
Tell us how you knew
about the crime scene

01:20:57.848 --> 01:21:02.843
before the police did

01:21:02.919 --> 01:21:05.753
It's easy

01:21:08.892 --> 01:21:10.690
Because it was me

01:21:12.896 --> 01:21:14.831
I did it

01:21:17.634 --> 01:21:21.628
I.

01:21:21.705 --> 01:21:23.674
Killed. Them.

01:21:25.675 --> 01:21:26.665
Liar

01:21:29.846 --> 01:21:31.882
Don't lie, you crazy bastard

01:21:31.882 --> 01:21:34.684
Why are you lying?

01:21:34.684 --> 01:21:36.812
Have you gone mad?

01:21:36.887 --> 01:21:39.656
- You lost your mind
- Hey!

01:21:39.656 --> 01:21:41.818
Stop that

01:22:08.885 --> 01:22:09.875
Stop these people

01:22:13.857 --> 01:22:15.655
Bring our baby back

01:22:17.694 --> 01:22:18.684
Get out of the way

01:22:19.896 --> 01:22:20.864
Clear the way

01:22:22.632 --> 01:22:23.725
Why did you kill her?

01:22:30.473 --> 01:22:33.341
I got a special promotion
and a vacation reward

01:22:34.811 --> 01:22:36.712
He's right next to me

01:22:37.847 --> 01:22:38.815
What?

01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:43.620
Are you trying to embarrass me?

01:22:43.687 --> 01:22:46.623
Alright, alright... Wait

01:22:46.823 --> 01:22:48.692
- Choi
- Sir

01:22:48.692 --> 01:22:49.853
- Take a picture for me
- Yes, sir

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:53.830
This is embarrassing...
Lift your head for the camera

01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:56.629
One, two

01:23:19.789 --> 01:23:20.757
Jun!

01:23:22.826 --> 01:23:23.816
Jun

01:23:24.728 --> 01:23:25.752
Kim Jun

01:23:38.775 --> 01:23:42.712
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault

01:23:44.647 --> 01:23:45.740
I trusted you

01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:48.716
I trusted you

01:23:50.053 --> 01:23:53.046
You were gonna use me
That was your plan all along

01:23:53.223 --> 01:23:54.213
It's not like that

01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:56.987
Because I'm different from others

01:23:57.193 --> 01:23:58.320
Because I'm a freak

01:24:02.799 --> 01:24:03.823
Put the gun down

01:24:05.668 --> 01:24:06.795
Why couldn't you leave me alone?

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:12.741
I never wanted this

01:24:14.244 --> 01:24:16.179
It's not my fault

01:24:17.847 --> 01:24:20.817
So I was gonna live in hiding
as if I didn't exist

01:24:26.423 --> 01:24:27.584
It's all because of this hand

01:24:29.325 --> 01:24:30.384
This cursed hand

01:24:31.361 --> 01:24:31.885
No!

01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:39.692
Are you alright, man?

01:24:43.873 --> 01:24:44.806
Alright

01:24:49.312 --> 01:24:51.281
Why did you do it?

01:24:51.448 --> 01:24:53.610
Why did you lie? Why?

01:24:54.384 --> 01:24:57.320
Because it's better
that I'm in prison

01:24:58.354 --> 01:25:00.448
This is a hand that kills people

01:25:01.858 --> 01:25:03.724
My mom died because of it...

01:25:07.363 --> 01:25:09.355
It wasn't your fault

01:25:09.499 --> 01:25:11.491
Leave me alone

01:25:11.601 --> 01:25:14.469
I don't care what happens to me now

01:25:15.438 --> 01:25:16.337
Look at me

01:25:18.475 --> 01:25:21.377
I'm never gonna leave you
hanging again

01:25:21.511 --> 01:25:23.446
Give me one more chance

01:25:29.719 --> 01:25:31.688
<i>Kidnap-murder suspect escaped
I repeat, suspect on the run</i>

01:25:31.688 --> 01:25:32.922
<i>Runaway vehicle is silver Carnival</i>

01:25:32.922 --> 01:25:37.727
<i>Registration number 60-ga 5223</i>

01:25:37.727 --> 01:25:39.753
<i>Expected route in the direction
of Outer Circular</i>

01:25:40.663 --> 01:25:42.291
What do we do now?

01:25:42.398 --> 01:25:45.493
Catch the kidnapper. What else?

01:25:45.568 --> 01:25:49.369
It looks like if we don't
we're both going to jail

01:25:54.777 --> 01:25:57.770
Did you find anything, man?

01:25:58.748 --> 01:26:01.718
Those commercial freezers
have a short life

01:26:01.718 --> 01:26:03.687
If the perp sold his
on the second hand market

01:26:03.753 --> 01:26:05.788
it ought to be out here somewhere

01:26:05.788 --> 01:26:09.725
Only there are...

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.355
so many of them

01:26:13.863 --> 01:26:15.661
What do we do now?

01:26:20.770 --> 01:26:21.760
Hey

01:26:22.872 --> 01:26:24.670
You can't

01:26:36.886 --> 01:26:39.651
This is a hand

01:26:39.722 --> 01:26:40.815
that saves lives

01:27:26.836 --> 01:27:28.668
Jun! Jun!

01:27:31.774 --> 01:27:32.764
You alright?

01:27:37.747 --> 01:27:38.806
I found it

01:27:49.859 --> 01:27:53.626
You must be hungry
Have some supper

01:28:01.771 --> 01:28:03.740
I told you not to touch the wound

01:28:06.876 --> 01:28:07.844
Come here

01:28:10.813 --> 01:28:11.803
Come on out

01:28:20.523 --> 01:28:22.549
It'll leave a scar

01:28:29.365 --> 01:28:30.526
Let's clean it before you eat

01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:50.743
I got the address

01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:52.880
Tripolis, Gongdeok-dong...

01:28:53.623 --> 01:28:54.716
What's the apartment number?

01:29:21.751 --> 01:29:23.720
I was gonna be nice to you

01:29:24.787 --> 01:29:27.848
But you leave me with no choice

01:29:31.794 --> 01:29:33.763
How are we supposed to find him
without the house number?

01:29:33.763 --> 01:29:36.799
You take floors 1 to 10

01:29:36.799 --> 01:29:37.900
I'll do 11 and above

01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:39.835
Knock on every door

01:29:39.902 --> 01:29:41.871
If there is anything strange,
call me right away

01:29:42.071 --> 01:29:42.629
Got it

01:29:42.872 --> 01:29:44.738
Jun, stay here

01:29:44.807 --> 01:29:47.810
and call the police
if we're not back in 30 minutes

01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:48.709
Let's go

01:29:55.752 --> 01:29:57.744
I'm sorry

01:30:01.758 --> 01:30:02.817
Who are you?

01:30:06.829 --> 01:30:07.797
Oops

01:30:08.765 --> 01:30:10.631
It's this house

01:31:16.866 --> 01:31:18.596
Excuse me

01:31:21.437 --> 01:31:25.374
Which floor are you going to?

01:31:30.847 --> 01:31:32.849
I'm going to 20, too

01:31:32.849 --> 01:31:33.817
I see

01:31:44.894 --> 01:31:46.624
<i>20th floor</i>

01:31:52.935 --> 01:31:55.598
You live on 20, too?

01:31:55.905 --> 01:31:58.674
I've never seen you around

01:31:58.674 --> 01:32:01.803
I'm visiting a friend

01:32:01.878 --> 01:32:02.777
I see

01:32:20.897 --> 01:32:22.627
Da-hui

01:32:23.866 --> 01:32:24.856
Da-hui

01:32:37.213 --> 01:32:39.375
But there is only my condo
on 20th floor

01:32:47.823 --> 01:32:48.847
Who are you, kid?

01:33:00.803 --> 01:33:01.793
Da-hui

01:33:05.841 --> 01:33:06.900
Da-hui

01:33:29.932 --> 01:33:31.696
<i>Prickly bastard</i>

01:33:32.835 --> 01:33:34.667
Jun?

01:33:35.671 --> 01:33:39.675
<i>Where are you, man?</i>

01:33:39.675 --> 01:33:40.843
Can you hear me? Jun?

01:33:40.843 --> 01:33:42.835
Son of a bitch

01:34:12.708 --> 01:34:13.835
Does it hurt a lot?

01:34:34.830 --> 01:34:36.822
Huh?

01:34:49.712 --> 01:34:50.839
It must

01:34:54.884 --> 01:34:57.718
Never stabbed a man before

01:34:57.787 --> 01:34:59.847
It feels weird

01:34:59.922 --> 01:35:03.859
It feels so weird

01:35:06.762 --> 01:35:08.731
Where is she?

01:35:08.798 --> 01:35:09.766
Well

01:35:12.435 --> 01:35:13.596
I killed her already

01:35:21.744 --> 01:35:22.837
Don't move

01:35:23.879 --> 01:35:26.610
It will hurt more if you let air in

01:35:29.685 --> 01:35:30.846
Why the children?

01:35:31.887 --> 01:35:34.857
There is no why
I just kill them

01:35:36.325 --> 01:35:40.194
Do you know how many animals
I put down everyday?

01:35:40.296 --> 01:35:42.458
It's only another child

01:35:43.899 --> 01:35:46.698
If I have to answer

01:35:48.204 --> 01:35:50.332
They're cutest when they're little

01:35:50.873 --> 01:35:53.776
They're cute and they listen to you

01:35:53.776 --> 01:35:58.646
But sometimes they misunderstand
my good intentions

01:35:58.748 --> 01:36:00.580
and try to bite me

01:36:01.784 --> 01:36:03.810
What choice does that leave me

01:36:06.889 --> 01:36:08.687
but to put them down?

01:36:18.801 --> 01:36:19.894
Hello?

01:36:23.773 --> 01:36:27.733
I must have put the TV on too loud

01:36:27.810 --> 01:36:29.642
Sure

01:36:43.893 --> 01:36:46.896
Whether it's human or animal,

01:36:46.896 --> 01:36:49.832
your brain pumps out endorphins
when you die

01:36:50.866 --> 01:36:54.735
They must have felt good

01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:02.572
Don't!

01:37:08.784 --> 01:37:09.843
This is exciting

01:37:12.922 --> 01:37:16.689
Maybe I didn't give you
a sufficient dose

01:37:46.655 --> 01:37:47.816
Don't let go

01:38:03.672 --> 01:38:04.765
Let go, Jun

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:06.741
Let him go or you'll die, too

01:38:23.792 --> 01:38:25.658
Let him go, you fool

01:38:27.029 --> 01:38:29.089
I'm begging you

01:38:33.869 --> 01:38:35.633
Not yet

01:38:36.739 --> 01:38:38.640
Not just yet

01:39:00.796 --> 01:39:01.786
Got it

01:39:21.717 --> 01:39:22.741
Help me

01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:25.844
Save me

01:39:33.862 --> 01:39:35.763
Save me

01:39:53.849 --> 01:39:54.839
Jun

01:39:56.885 --> 01:39:58.820
Jun

01:40:00.689 --> 01:40:01.850
Come on, man

01:40:02.825 --> 01:40:03.758
Jun

01:40:05.828 --> 01:40:06.818
Jun?

01:40:07.863 --> 01:40:10.628
First floor of this building

01:40:11.734 --> 01:40:13.669
Veterinary clinic

01:40:15.704 --> 01:40:16.763
In the freezer

01:40:18.707 --> 01:40:19.834
She's alive

01:40:35.524 --> 01:40:37.584
Hand that save lives, you said

01:40:49.271 --> 01:40:50.239
Over here

01:40:50.406 --> 01:40:51.396
- Over here, Park
- Yes, sir

01:40:51.507 --> 01:40:53.476
Look for a freezer

01:40:53.709 --> 01:40:54.743
Freezer... Fridge...

01:40:54.743 --> 01:40:56.268
- There isn't one
- Lieutenant

01:40:56.378 --> 01:40:57.368
Over there... What's that?

01:40:57.446 --> 01:40:58.414
This way

01:41:03.452 --> 01:41:04.420
Hurry

01:41:10.726 --> 01:41:11.659
Da-hui

01:41:12.761 --> 01:41:13.796
Da-hui

01:41:13.796 --> 01:41:15.788
Wake up, sweetie

01:41:16.799 --> 01:41:17.823
Good girl

01:41:18.767 --> 01:41:20.702
Breathe

01:41:31.713 --> 01:41:32.848
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

01:41:32.848 --> 01:41:37.616
What do you think?

01:41:37.686 --> 01:41:39.655
A huge kitchen knife
went through my guts

01:41:39.721 --> 01:41:41.690
not once but over and over again

01:41:41.690 --> 01:41:45.627
then he twisted the blade

01:41:45.694 --> 01:41:49.654
and put his finger and
pulled my intestines

01:41:49.731 --> 01:41:51.632
Do you think I'll be alright?

01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:52.768
Let's pray

01:41:52.768 --> 01:41:54.634
The doctor said

01:41:54.703 --> 01:41:58.707
it's a miracle that I survived it

01:41:58.707 --> 01:42:00.709
<i>What happened to my reward money?</i>

01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:01.768
Money-grubbing bastard

01:42:01.844 --> 01:42:03.679
<i>What happened to
my fifty grand, man?</i>

01:42:03.679 --> 01:42:06.849
I barely survived a vicious knife attack

01:42:06.849 --> 01:42:10.652
You never came by to look in on me
All you gotta talk about is money?

01:42:10.652 --> 01:42:11.620
<i>Yeah</i>

01:42:14.823 --> 01:42:18.624
Not a single visitor to the last day

01:42:18.694 --> 01:42:21.663
Your brother was here
a few days ago

01:42:21.663 --> 01:42:22.865
My brother?

01:42:22.865 --> 01:42:25.734
The handsome one...
With a sharp nose?

01:42:25.734 --> 01:42:28.795
He came by late and
stayed till morning

01:42:35.344 --> 01:42:36.403
Wasn't it your brother?

01:42:36.845 --> 01:42:39.815
Yes, it's him

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.786
Prickly bastard

01:42:49.858 --> 01:42:52.760
Jun! Are you in there, man?

01:43:08.911 --> 01:43:11.745
<i>The number you have dialed
is not available</i>

01:43:11.813 --> 01:43:14.715
<i>Please check and try again</i>

01:43:20.389 --> 01:43:22.381
<i>Suspect runaway vehicle
registration number as follows..</i>

01:43:22.491 --> 01:43:27.361
<i>54-ja 2810, I repeat, 54-ja 2810</i>

01:43:27.496 --> 01:43:29.397
<i>Suspect is in Jongro heading
in the direction of Myeongdong</i>

01:43:29.531 --> 01:43:32.524
<i>Nearby patrol cars please report</i>

01:43:32.668 --> 01:43:34.034
<i>Confirm your location</i>

01:43:34.136 --> 01:43:36.469
Does he want Myeongdong or Jongro?

01:43:36.638 --> 01:43:38.903
Make up your mind, man

01:43:39.141 --> 01:43:41.633
Which one shall we go to?

01:43:44.713 --> 01:43:46.682
Pull over for a second

01:44:25.754 --> 01:44:27.746
<i>Hapjeong Station</i>

01:44:33.495 --> 01:44:34.588
How are you, bro?

01:44:35.305 --> 01:44:41.355
