They need to know everything.

13:04.522 --> 13:07.003
One inch of reinforced steel
on every window.

13:07.047 --> 13:09.527
I don't think we're
getting through those.

13:09.571 --> 13:11.312
I'll figure
something out.

13:11.355 --> 13:13.793
I know you will.

13:13.836 --> 13:17.361
Listen, man, I'm sorry
about before.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.320
Like I said, things
have been intense.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.365
So much depends
on this working out.

13:21.409 --> 13:23.411
My nephew's life depends
on this working.

13:23.454 --> 13:25.500
I know it does.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.241
I never asked--
how old is he?

13:27.284 --> 13:29.286
Sixteen.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.549
Oh, hell.

13:32.681 --> 13:34.161
T-BAG:
Knock knocka.

13:34.204 --> 13:35.989
What do you want?

13:36.032 --> 13:38.556
Me? I just came by
to slip something

13:38.600 --> 13:39.819
into your mail slot.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.472
It's from
El Patrón himself,

13:41.516 --> 13:43.997
but it was made
for your eyes only.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.041
Grabby.

13:45.085 --> 13:47.478
That don't look
like no invitation

13:47.522 --> 13:48.784
to the Sona-Hawkins Dance.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.090
What do you got cooking up
with Lechero, huh?

13:50.133 --> 13:52.396
It's none of your business,
Theodore.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.224
You want to keep secrets?

13:54.268 --> 13:56.966
You want to treat me
like a pesky insect? Fine.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.794
Just remember,
information, like crumbs,

13:58.838 --> 14:01.231
always trickles down
to the vermin on the floor.

14:10.414 --> 14:12.547
4:00?

14:12.590 --> 14:16.681
It's a sketch of
Lechero's quarters.

14:28.563 --> 14:32.349
To be honest, when a tenant
pays a year's rent in advance

14:32.393 --> 14:33.307
and then gets locked up,

14:33.350 --> 14:34.699
I normally rent
the place out

14:34.743 --> 14:37.441
and double my
money, but, uh,

14:37.485 --> 14:39.661
James was a good man.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.924
I was hoping things would
turn out well for him.

14:45.580 --> 14:48.888
Look, uh, miss...

14:48.931 --> 14:50.977
a lot of guys have a little
something on the side.

14:51.020 --> 14:54.502
This apartment, I mean,
whoever he brought here,

14:54.545 --> 14:56.678
doesn't mean
he didn't love ya.

14:58.158 --> 15:02.423
You said you have James'
insurance paper?

15:02.466 --> 15:04.468
Right on. Right on.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.427
I'll, uh, I'll go get them.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.342
[keys jingling]

15:18.134 --> 15:20.354
[sighs]

15:29.406 --> 15:31.321
Oh, God.

15:44.552 --> 15:47.207
There's another door in here.

15:52.560 --> 15:56.390
"4413."

15:56.433 --> 15:57.652
[keypad beeping]

15:57.695 --> 15:59.436
[latch clicks]

16:14.538 --> 16:18.629
4413, huh?

16:18.673 --> 16:20.370
[grunts]

16:23.504 --> 16:25.462
[sighs]

16:27.551 --> 16:29.553
What about Scofield?

16:29.597 --> 16:30.859
Kill him.

16:30.902 --> 16:33.775
You know, if Lechero
didn't send this,

16:33.818 --> 16:36.821
T-Bag might be setting
me up for someone.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.736
What do you say we
get out of here?

16:38.780 --> 16:41.391
I'm truly sorry you got caught
up in my troubles, Michael.

16:50.444 --> 16:51.575
[latch clicks]

16:56.624 --> 16:58.452
LECHERO:
Scofield.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.586
I take it there's
another code.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.197
I'm the only one that knows it.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.415
For a man who likes
keeping a secret,

17:05.459 --> 17:06.590
using T-Bag as a go-between

17:06.634 --> 17:08.331
might not be the smartest move.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.899
Yeah, by the time
he figures it out,
we'll be long gone.

17:10.942 --> 17:13.989
Sammy's on his way back.
Let's go.

17:32.921 --> 17:35.010
What the hell's this?

17:36.620 --> 17:37.839
Underground tunnel.

17:37.882 --> 17:40.102
The old administration
used it

17:40.146 --> 17:42.844
to travel between cellblocks
A and B.

17:42.887 --> 17:47.501
After the riots,
they moved us all to B.

17:47.544 --> 17:50.591
And then the soldiers
came in,

17:50.634 --> 17:52.332
blew this tunnel up.

18:02.168 --> 18:05.127
MICHAEL:
Looks like someone already tried
to get through the debris.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.956
I never planned to spend
my whole life in Sona.

18:07.999 --> 18:10.785
Just didn't expect
it to end so soon.

18:10.828 --> 18:13.222
You're the engineer,
though, right?

18:13.266 --> 18:15.094
You can dig
our way out of this?

18:15.137 --> 18:18.445
Yeah, me and a couple
of payloaders.

18:18.488 --> 18:19.707
LECHERO:
Now, you listen.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.448
You're gonna dig
out of this place.

18:21.491 --> 18:26.714
We're not digging out,
but we might be digging up.

18:39.248 --> 18:40.815
Hello, Sofia.

18:42.469 --> 18:43.861
Hello. Who are you?

18:43.905 --> 18:45.863
Friend of James.

18:45.907 --> 18:46.908
Old friend.

18:46.951 --> 18:50.433
Well, he isn't here.

18:50.477 --> 18:53.262
I know where he is.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.355
I can see why James loves you.

19:00.704 --> 19:02.358
You are beautiful.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.665
But if you keep sticking
your nose where

19:04.708 --> 19:05.927
it doesn't belong,

19:05.970 --> 19:08.451
I'm gonna make him miss you
very, very much.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.714
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

19:12.673 --> 19:14.588
Good.

19:16.372 --> 19:18.418
You don't need to
worry about this.

19:18.461 --> 19:22.117
Now listen very carefully to me,
Sofia, and you won't get hurt.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.293
I want you to go home
and do your hair

19:24.337 --> 19:26.513
and paint your nails
and get all ready

19:26.556 --> 19:28.341
for when James comes home.

19:28.384 --> 19:30.081
You two will live
happily ever after.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.866
What do you want from him?

19:31.909 --> 19:33.041
[chuckling lightly]

19:33.084 --> 19:35.739
See? You're not
listening already.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.654
Don't get in
the way,

19:37.698 --> 19:40.875
or I promise you things
will get very bad for you.

19:45.836 --> 19:48.187
You are truly beautiful.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.671
I hope you can stay that way.

19:55.977 --> 19:58.197
Get the hell out of here.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.037
MICHAEL:
All right,
if we can get through

20:13.081 --> 20:15.562
the ceiling, the foundation
and the earth on top of that,

20:15.605 --> 20:18.129
we can make it out
into the middle of no-man's-land

20:18.173 --> 20:20.349
and maybe hit the fence
before we get shot.

20:20.393 --> 20:22.873
Yeah.
Well, we wouldn't want that.

20:22.917 --> 20:25.136
Yes, but you can
dig out, though, right?

20:25.180 --> 20:27.878
Based on gravity and the kind
of sand that Sona's built on,

20:27.922 --> 20:30.794
we're gonna need some kind
of support brace for the tunnel.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.187
Or...

20:32.231 --> 20:33.580
Or what?

20:33.623 --> 20:37.279
The whole thing collapses
and we're buried alive.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.459
Go on and relax, huh?

20:43.503 --> 20:45.766
I'll get some rum.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.420
[chuckling]

20:47.463 --> 20:49.378
LECHERO:
How long will this take?

20:49.422 --> 20:51.293
Maybe two days.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.164
I got to get upstairs,
estimate exactly where

20:53.208 --> 20:55.297
in no-man's land
that tunnel's gonna let out.

20:55.341 --> 20:56.864
[latch clicks]

21:02.913 --> 21:04.828
Where you going?
I'm meditating.

21:04.872 --> 21:07.440
Just getting rum
for Cristobal and his boys.

21:07.483 --> 21:09.006
Rum?! His boys?!

21:09.050 --> 21:11.661
No, I said I'd meet
with Cristobal,

21:11.705 --> 21:12.923
not every half-breed in Sona.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.751
All right, well,
they up there right now.

21:14.795 --> 21:15.970
So, let's go.

21:16.013 --> 21:17.319
Let me just
get some rum, now.
No, man.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.408
Them drink beer
like everyone else.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.280
Look, man, I offered
them something good.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.673
Don't make me look the fool.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.109
[grabs arm]

21:25.153 --> 21:26.763
The rum is for me, Sammy.

21:26.807 --> 21:28.330
Now...

21:28.374 --> 21:29.766
you have a problem with that?

21:32.769 --> 21:34.902
No, sir.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.817
Good.

21:36.860 --> 21:39.428
Let's go.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.738
Let's get back to work.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.615
Hey, only Lechero has the code.

21:52.659 --> 21:54.748
We don't need
a code.

21:58.969 --> 22:00.580
Now, get inside

22:00.623 --> 22:01.798
before Sammy comes back.

22:09.023 --> 22:11.025
Alex?

22:15.464 --> 22:18.119
Where's Agent Lang?

22:18.162 --> 22:19.599
Agent... I don't know.

22:19.642 --> 22:22.123
But what the hell's wrong
with you? What's going on?

22:22.166 --> 22:24.517
I have a right to be nervous.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.257
My life is on the line,
you know?

22:26.301 --> 22:27.824
What are you
talking about?

22:27.868 --> 22:31.132
You have given live press
conferences your entire life.

22:31.175 --> 22:32.394
I've see you many times.
You're an old pro.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.918
Now, splash some water
on your face.

22:34.962 --> 22:37.094
The panel wants us there
right now, immediately.

22:37.138 --> 22:38.966
What?Get dressed.

22:39.009 --> 22:40.315
Or would you rather
have me

22:40.359 --> 22:41.708
drag your ass
back to Sona?

22:41.751 --> 22:44.972
Water on the face.
Get your suit on. We're going.

22:48.932 --> 22:50.064
Yeah, it's Sullins.

22:50.107 --> 22:52.066
Uh, we're almost ready
to move here.

22:52.109 --> 22:53.763
Where the hell is Lang?

22:53.807 --> 22:55.896
No.

22:55.939 --> 22:57.593
Where are we at?

22:57.637 --> 22:59.073
Everything's in place.

22:59.116 --> 23:00.770
Good. We've done our part.

23:00.814 --> 23:04.078
Now it's time for Whistler
to step up and do his.

23:04.121 --> 23:07.211
Come 5:00, he'd better be ready.

23:07.255 --> 23:09.257
Three feet
of concrete and rebar,

23:09.300 --> 23:11.520
plus ten feet
of dirt and sand,

23:11.564 --> 23:13.653
before we see sky.

23:17.570 --> 23:18.614
Are you all right?

23:18.658 --> 23:22.270
To be completely honest...

23:22.313 --> 23:23.880
no,

23:23.924 --> 23:25.186
not really.

23:25.229 --> 23:27.449
I have this thing
for, uh, confined spaces.

23:27.493 --> 23:28.929
Are you telling me
you're claustrophobic?

23:28.972 --> 23:30.278
Ever since I was a...

23:30.321 --> 23:31.410
boy.

23:31.453 --> 23:33.455
Um, you know,
I need to be upstairs.

23:33.499 --> 23:35.283
That's not really
an option right now.

23:35.326 --> 23:38.112
Well, staying here is
not really an option
for me, either.

23:38.155 --> 23:39.983
I suggest you get
yourself together.

23:40.027 --> 23:41.855
I just need some air.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.207
What the hell's the
matter with you?

23:46.250 --> 23:49.036
I need to get out
of here; I need air.Hey, you walk

23:49.079 --> 23:52.039
through that door with
Sammy on the other side,
you'll never need air again.

23:52.082 --> 23:55.695
You don't understand--
I need to get out of here now.

23:55.738 --> 23:58.480
Why don't you tell me
what's really going
on here, Whistler?

23:58.524 --> 24:00.264
Why do you keep
looking at your watch?

24:00.308 --> 24:02.092
What are you really up to?

24:02.136 --> 24:05.705
Scofield, the men are gone--
let's move.

24:11.275 --> 24:13.364
I need your cell phone.

24:13.408 --> 24:15.497
No, Sammy's on his way--
get out of here.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.804
I have to call my brother.No, cell phone stays with me.
Now, get out of here!

24:20.850 --> 24:23.026
MAN:
Well, just so that
we're clear, Americano,

24:23.070 --> 24:25.725
she's got no electricity
and no running water.

24:25.768 --> 24:28.902
Septic's out, too, but there's
an outhouse in the woods.

24:28.945 --> 24:32.166
It's perfect.
A hundred bucks a month.$200.

24:32.209 --> 24:34.385
A hundred bucks a month.

24:35.517 --> 24:36.910
Deal.

24:36.953 --> 24:39.652
But I don't want growing
no drugs on the land.

24:39.695 --> 24:40.914
No marijuana.

24:42.176 --> 24:43.612
You got that?

24:51.054 --> 24:53.535
Welcome home, my friend.Thanks.

24:55.406 --> 24:57.060
LINCOLN:
Listen, man, if you want

24:57.104 --> 24:59.802
to get out of here,
I'd get it and
Michael would, too.

24:59.846 --> 25:02.370
You've done more
than enough.
If I had a kid

25:02.413 --> 25:04.415
in the same situation
as your son,

25:04.459 --> 25:06.896
would you and your brother
walk out on me?

25:06.940 --> 25:08.028
Yeah.

25:08.071 --> 25:10.291
[laughs]
Here, this is good.

25:10.334 --> 25:11.901
Put it down there.

25:13.163 --> 25:15.470
Okay, hold on.

25:17.559 --> 25:19.169
You ready?

25:19.213 --> 25:19.909
Yeah.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.742
I hope this works,
papi.

25:27.743 --> 25:30.659
All right, let's go.

25:33.532 --> 25:34.794
McGrady.

25:38.319 --> 25:40.016
I need your help.

25:40.060 --> 25:42.366
Not now, bro-- my father finally
got here; I'm gonna go see him.

25:42.410 --> 25:45.239
Actually, uh,
I need his help, too.

25:45.282 --> 25:47.589
What you want from my old man?

25:47.633 --> 25:49.199
I just need
someone to deliver

25:49.243 --> 25:51.767
a message on the outside,
someone I can trust.

25:51.811 --> 25:53.726
Hell, no. My papa's
straight as razor blade.

25:53.769 --> 25:56.642
He don't get into kind
of trouble like you do.

25:56.685 --> 26:00.297
It's not trouble--
it's just a phone call.No.

26:00.341 --> 26:01.777
I love my father.

26:01.821 --> 26:03.474
And I love my brother--
and if he doesn't

26:03.518 --> 26:06.521
get this message, something
horrible's gonna happen to him.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.523
Something really
bad is going on.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.655
Please.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.445
Hello, son.

26:17.488 --> 26:19.229
Papa.

26:19.273 --> 26:21.884
You look very handsome.

26:21.928 --> 26:23.103
Like your school picture.

26:23.146 --> 26:25.235
Gracias.

26:25.279 --> 26:28.108
I cleaned a guy's cell
for this shirt.

26:28.151 --> 26:30.719
You should be in school now...

26:30.763 --> 26:32.852
It's okay, Papa.with your friends.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.421
Papa, please,
don't get upset.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.989
I-I have friends in here.

26:40.033 --> 26:41.687
The American?

26:41.730 --> 26:43.689
Yes. He's nice.

26:43.732 --> 26:47.083
He keeps his word--
it's very rare in Sona.

26:47.127 --> 26:48.345
And, uh...

26:48.389 --> 26:50.652
he needs my help.

26:52.436 --> 26:54.525
Thank God you're here.

26:54.569 --> 26:56.440
Thought you might have
come a little earlier,

26:56.484 --> 26:58.312
just to make sure I was okay.

26:58.355 --> 27:01.576
I read the newspaper;
I knew you were safe.

27:01.620 --> 27:05.406
I am for now--
but you might not be.

27:05.449 --> 27:07.364
Now, listen
to me carefully.

27:07.408 --> 27:11.194
Promise me you won't go anywhere
near Lincoln Burrows today.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.631
Lincoln?It's just too dangerous

27:12.674 --> 27:15.198
to be around him,
to be with him, to be near him.

27:15.242 --> 27:18.288
Just go home
and stay there,

27:18.332 --> 27:20.464
and I will call you tonight.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.379
That's all I can say.

27:22.423 --> 27:24.555
Do you understand?

27:24.599 --> 27:27.863
Call me? From where?Do you understand me?

27:27.907 --> 27:29.169
Yeah.

27:29.212 --> 27:30.257
Promise me.

27:30.300 --> 27:31.650
Say it out loud.

27:31.693 --> 27:33.956
I promise.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.655
Why are you
so scared?

27:36.698 --> 27:40.049
Because I can't
have you get hurt.

27:42.356 --> 27:46.273
[voice breaking]:
Because I love you...
more than anything in the world.

27:47.578 --> 27:49.668
Do you?

27:50.625 --> 27:52.279
Yeah.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.455
[sniffles]
James,

27:54.498 --> 27:55.717
I got a call today

27:55.761 --> 27:58.024
from a man who said
he's your landlord.

27:59.416 --> 28:01.941
Talking about another apartment.

28:03.333 --> 28:04.378
Should I call him back?

28:04.421 --> 28:05.988
Must have been a wrong number.

28:06.032 --> 28:08.382
He asked for you by name.

28:08.425 --> 28:09.731
The man is clearly confused.

28:09.775 --> 28:12.081
I don't know anything
about another apartment.

28:12.125 --> 28:13.648
Sofia,

28:13.692 --> 28:17.304
all I know is that you've got
to stay away from Lincoln.

28:17.347 --> 28:19.349
Please.

28:19.393 --> 28:22.352
[softly]:
Okay, James.

28:22.396 --> 28:24.964
I'll wait for your call.

28:29.446 --> 28:31.753
McGRADY'S FATHER:
Here.

28:31.797 --> 28:34.364
I have this.

28:34.408 --> 28:36.671
I don't want to see it.

28:37.541 --> 28:40.327
I'll... put it with the others.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.372
I'm not coming home.

28:42.416 --> 28:43.939
Accept that.

28:47.856 --> 28:49.771
You should go.

28:51.773 --> 28:54.994
Make that call for my friend.

28:58.345 --> 29:01.174
Happy birthday, son.

29:12.489 --> 29:15.362
Maybe we should
pick up some locks

29:15.405 --> 29:17.843
and secure the house.It can't have
anything new on it.

29:17.886 --> 29:20.236
[phone ringing]The place needs
to look abandoned.

29:21.672 --> 29:22.935
Yeah?

29:22.978 --> 29:24.675
McGRADY'S FATHER:
I have a message for you.

29:24.719 --> 29:26.373
Don't come home for dinner.

29:26.416 --> 29:27.548
Who is this?

29:27.591 --> 29:29.245
I'm supposed to tell you,

29:29.289 --> 29:31.639
don't come home for dinner.

29:31.682 --> 29:32.640
What?

29:32.683 --> 29:34.947
When me and
Mikey were kids,

29:34.990 --> 29:36.775
we had a code when
Social Services

29:36.818 --> 29:39.429
were trying to get me
into juvie.

29:39.473 --> 29:41.692
He's telling me
to watch my back.

29:44.739 --> 29:46.872
LINCOLN:
What the hell
are you doing here?

29:46.915 --> 29:49.657
SOFIA:
Why haven't you returned
my calls or my car?

29:49.700 --> 29:51.050
SUSAN B. [over phone]:
You have him?

29:51.093 --> 29:53.704
MAN:
Yeah, he just arrived
back at his hotel.

29:53.748 --> 29:55.445
But Whistler's girl
tracked him down.

29:55.489 --> 29:56.446
And she's talking

29:56.490 --> 29:59.406
to Lincoln and the Mexican.

29:59.449 --> 30:01.625
After what she saw today, she
could be complicating things.

30:01.669 --> 30:02.801
You have a directive?

30:02.844 --> 30:04.585
SUSAN B:
I warned her.

30:04.628 --> 30:06.021
Take them all out.

30:06.065 --> 30:07.414
What will Whistler say?

30:07.457 --> 30:10.417
I said take them all out.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.467
LINCOLN:
I don't care about
your boyfriend's apartment

30:17.511 --> 30:18.729
on the side,
I just don't care.

30:18.773 --> 30:20.470
SOFIA:
No, I went there.

30:20.514 --> 30:21.950
And a woman showed up;

30:21.994 --> 30:23.256
she threatened me.

30:23.299 --> 30:24.518
She knows James.

30:25.606 --> 30:27.521
Susan.

30:27.564 --> 30:28.522
You know her?

30:28.565 --> 30:30.219
She's the one who has LJ.

30:30.872 --> 30:34.441
She took
something I found,

30:34.484 --> 30:35.529
a passport.

30:35.572 --> 30:36.835
It had James' picture
and birthday

30:36.878 --> 30:39.794
but his name said Gary Miller.

30:39.838 --> 30:40.882
Lincoln, I don't know
what's going on.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.536
I'll tell you
what's going on--

30:42.579 --> 30:43.450
your boyfriend's a liar.

30:43.493 --> 30:44.668
I told you that from the start.

30:44.712 --> 30:46.627
James told me to stay away
from you today,

30:46.670 --> 30:48.237
that it was dangerous.

30:49.195 --> 30:50.849
Let's go.

31:00.989 --> 31:02.730
[phone ringing]

31:02.773 --> 31:04.427
Pronto.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.560
LINCOLN:
I need to speak
to Michael Scofield.

31:06.603 --> 31:07.256
I'm his brother.

31:08.823 --> 31:10.564
How you get this number?

31:12.653 --> 31:13.523
He called me a few days back.

31:13.567 --> 31:14.916
I-I didn't answer.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.571
But, listen,
I-I need to speak to him now.

31:17.614 --> 31:18.833
[closes phone]

31:27.015 --> 31:28.930
Let's go.

31:28.974 --> 31:30.714
You'll never guess
who that was--

31:30.758 --> 31:32.978
Michael Scofield's brother.

31:33.021 --> 31:34.588
Who calls me...

31:34.631 --> 31:36.982
and who I call,

31:37.025 --> 31:38.287
is my business.

31:44.511 --> 31:45.425
Where's your friends?

31:45.468 --> 31:46.252
I don't know.

31:46.295 --> 31:47.644
Where's your friends?

31:47.688 --> 31:49.995
I don't know,
Please don't shoot. Please.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.432
Drop it.

31:52.475 --> 31:54.216
[gun clatters on ground]Why are you
coming after us?

31:54.260 --> 31:55.000
[grunts]

31:56.479 --> 31:58.873
[grunting]

32:12.278 --> 32:15.542
Different day,
same problem, huh, Lincoln?

32:15.585 --> 32:17.587
You know how it turned out
when LJ was in this position,

32:17.631 --> 32:20.982
and today
is no different...

32:21.026 --> 32:24.159
so be a good boy
and put down the gun.

32:25.639 --> 32:27.597
Come on, Linc.

32:27.641 --> 32:29.556
I know you've learned
your lesson.

32:35.127 --> 32:37.520
You're right, I have.

32:40.784 --> 32:42.612
[silenced gunshot]

32:42.656 --> 32:44.875
[body thuds]

32:53.493 --> 32:56.017
MAN:
For the record, this is
an international hearing,

32:56.061 --> 32:58.324
requested by the United States
government,

32:58.367 --> 33:03.198
for the purpose of hearing
testimony from one

33:03.242 --> 33:04.808
Mr. Alexander Mahone.

33:04.852 --> 33:07.507
You gotta be kidding me.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.248
So, Mr. Mahone,

33:09.291 --> 33:11.859
when were you first contacted
by anyone

33:11.902 --> 33:16.081
from the group referred to
as the Company?

33:16.124 --> 33:17.560
They told me...

33:17.604 --> 33:21.956
that if I didn't kill every one
of the Fox River Eight

33:22.000 --> 33:24.263
that they would
come after me.

33:24.306 --> 33:25.786
They had all worked
with-with Scofield

33:25.829 --> 33:27.309
on-on-on the escape,

33:27.353 --> 33:29.964
so the Company wasn't sure
what they knew.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.401
Mr. Mahone, I'm
going to ask you

33:32.445 --> 33:35.404
to please keep your answer
related to the question.

33:35.448 --> 33:36.666
It's-it's
all connected.

33:36.710 --> 33:38.668
It's just... it's-it's a web.

33:38.712 --> 33:41.671
And-and it's a web
that I got caught in.

33:41.715 --> 33:43.673
And Lincoln Burrows
got caught in,

33:43.717 --> 33:46.241
and Michael Scofield
got caught in.

33:46.285 --> 33:47.242
SULLINS:
I, if I may,

33:47.286 --> 33:48.722
I think what Mr. Mahone...

33:48.765 --> 33:50.289
We're all
just like flies...was trying to say...

33:50.332 --> 33:51.420
Thank you, Mr. Sullins,

33:51.464 --> 33:52.465
but we're here to hear
from Mr. Mahone.

33:52.508 --> 33:54.641
Now, we're going
to try this again.

33:54.684 --> 33:57.557
When were you
first contacted

33:57.600 --> 33:59.472
by the Company?

34:01.474 --> 34:03.563
I cannot say.

34:03.606 --> 34:05.391
You know...

34:05.434 --> 34:08.394
they could be in contact
with you or-or-or...

34:08.437 --> 34:10.309
you could be in contact
with them, you'd never know.

34:10.352 --> 34:14.617
It's-it's... they could be
in contact with us right now.

34:14.661 --> 34:16.271
I know...

34:16.315 --> 34:17.577
it sounds crazy, right?

34:17.620 --> 34:19.448
It's craz...
and...

34:19.492 --> 34:22.060
and it would be, except for
the simple fact that...

34:22.103 --> 34:23.626
it's true.

34:23.670 --> 34:26.064
The government that I had
dedicated my life to

34:26.107 --> 34:28.805
manipulate
and extorted me.

34:28.849 --> 34:30.807
Blackmailed me.

34:30.851 --> 34:33.897
So that I would kill for them.

34:33.941 --> 34:37.988
And I did the things
that they made me do

34:38.032 --> 34:41.122
so I could protect my family.

34:43.777 --> 34:44.778
And so...

34:48.390 --> 34:50.653
I would like to go home.

34:54.527 --> 34:57.530
So can I do that, please?

35:01.751 --> 35:02.709
Hey.

35:04.885 --> 35:06.582
Where have you been?

35:06.626 --> 35:08.062
I came looking

35:08.106 --> 35:10.108
for scrap metal for the support
brace for the tunnel.

35:10.151 --> 35:11.544
Really?

35:12.675 --> 35:15.722
Looks like a pretty
tight squeeze up there.

35:15.765 --> 35:16.897
You sure there's
enough fresh air,

35:16.940 --> 35:18.290
or does the claustrophobia
come and go?

35:18.333 --> 35:22.294
What's it like going through
life always distrustful?

35:22.337 --> 35:24.339
You tell me, James.

35:24.383 --> 35:25.993
Hate to break up
the brouhaha, gentlemen,

35:26.036 --> 35:28.300
but Lechero
would like to see you.

35:28.343 --> 35:31.085
Says it has something to do
with your big brother.

35:42.357 --> 35:46.231
Give us a moment,
will you, Teodoro?

35:57.242 --> 36:00.070
If your brother should ever
call my cell phone again,

36:00.114 --> 36:04.727
you tell him you're
the one that's gonna pay.

36:15.738 --> 36:17.566
[line ringing]

36:17.610 --> 36:18.828
Yeah?

36:18.872 --> 36:20.787
You got the message.Yeah, you were right.

36:20.830 --> 36:22.484
They just tried to take us out.

36:22.528 --> 36:23.659
I know.

36:23.703 --> 36:25.313
Whistler got a visit
from the Company.

36:25.357 --> 36:26.749
He's been acting
strange ever since.

36:26.793 --> 36:28.229
I'm telling you, Linc,
something's up.

36:28.273 --> 36:29.752
Doing more than
acting strange, man.

36:29.796 --> 36:30.840
He just told Sofia
not to be

36:30.884 --> 36:32.755
near me 'cause it's dangerous.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.628
The Company's coming after us.

36:37.891 --> 36:39.719
They don't need us anymore.

36:39.762 --> 36:42.200
Here we go.

36:42.243 --> 36:45.638
They're breaking him out
on their own.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.473
[over radio]:
We're 100 yards
from the target.

36:54.516 --> 36:57.302
All right, keep your
eyes open-- let's get
in and out fast.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.436
Come on!

37:09.923 --> 37:10.924
Damn!

37:30.639 --> 37:31.858
Come on!
Keep it coming!

37:33.816 --> 37:34.861

We can't-- we're taking
too much fire.

38:33.398 --> 38:36.183
MAN:
Can't get a clean shot!

38:36.226 --> 38:38.620
I'll get lower,
take him out!

38:38.664 --> 38:42.711
Stay on 'em, stay on 'em.

38:44.191 --> 38:47.368
Driver's side assume
covering fire.

38:47.412 --> 38:50.415
Fire, go, fire,
fire, fire!

38:50.458 --> 38:53.635
[heavy gunfire]

38:53.679 --> 38:54.854
[grunts]

38:54.897 --> 38:57.030
[over radio]:
Man down. Man down.

38:57.073 --> 38:59.249
Let go, you
son of a bitch!

39:04.037 --> 39:05.734
We're losing him.

39:05.778 --> 39:07.562
[grunting]

39:07.606 --> 39:11.827
[over radio]:
We lost Whistler. Abort. Abort.

39:11.871 --> 39:12.872
Mission failure.

39:12.915 --> 39:16.571
Return to Base One immediately.

39:22.098 --> 39:25.841
[alarm blaring]

39:38.158 --> 39:40.987
[overlapping shouting]

40:00.006 --> 40:02.661
[alarm continues]

40:19.242 --> 40:22.550
[cell phone ringing]

40:28.556 --> 40:31.559
[ringing continues]

40:46.095 --> 40:48.446
Alex...

40:48.489 --> 40:50.796
I'm so sorry.

40:50.839 --> 40:54.626
I'm going to have
to take you back to Sona.

40:54.669 --> 40:57.977
[man yells in Spanish]

40:58.020 --> 41:00.806
Cállase la boca!

41:03.504 --> 41:06.551
[indistinct Spanish chatter]

41:31.053 --> 41:32.881
You, get up.

41:41.237 --> 41:43.109
Mr. Scofield,

41:43.152 --> 41:49.289
there have been two escape
attempts in the past two days.

41:49.332 --> 41:50.595
Somehow, I don't think
it's a coincidence

41:50.638 --> 41:54.294
that you arrived shortly
before they happened.

41:54.337 --> 41:56.557
I had nothing
to do with that.

41:59.604 --> 42:04.347
You've caused too many
problems here in Sona,

42:04.391 --> 42:07.916
so maybe you shouldn't
be here in Sona.

42:09.135 --> 42:11.703
Llevenlo!

42:11.746 --> 42:15.924
Say good-bye to
Sona, Mr. Scofield.

42:21.364 --> 42:23.671
[man shouts in Spanish]
