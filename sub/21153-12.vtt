JAMIE: Ten years ago,
the animal population mutated,

00:04.605 --> 00:06.707
endangering human
life on the planet.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.309
Our team managed to
cure the animals,

00:08.342 --> 00:10.778
but at a terrible cost.

00:10.811 --> 00:14.048
In an attempt to return
the planet to the animals,

00:14.082 --> 00:16.550
a secretive group called
the Shepherds released a gas

00:16.584 --> 00:18.352
that sterilized all of humanity.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.188
And then,
lab-made creatures called "hybrids"

00:20.221 --> 00:22.323
devastated the West Coast.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.691
(roaring)

00:23.724 --> 00:25.726
So a massive barrier
was constructed

00:25.759 --> 00:29.097
to protect the rest
of North America.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.165
But new breeds have
started to appear,

00:32.200 --> 00:33.567
so we reassembled our team.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.603
We battle on many fronts,

00:35.636 --> 00:37.671
searching for a
cure to sterility

00:37.705 --> 00:39.840
while racing to stop the hybrids

00:39.873 --> 00:42.243
and the rogue Shepherd
who created them

00:42.276 --> 00:45.413
to end the human race.

00:45.446 --> 00:48.482
The fight for mankind's
survival has just begun.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.852
Previously on Zoo...

00:51.885 --> 00:53.763
Jackson, what the hell?!
I don't trust you, Jamie.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.856
Leaving Mitch as
Duncan to kill Abigail?

00:55.889 --> 00:57.558
She's trying to end the world.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.293
She was raised by a mad man.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.829
I knew it! All this time,
you've been trying to save her.

01:01.862 --> 01:03.631
You destroyed my life once!

01:03.664 --> 01:05.275
ABIGAIL: We were both
on Pangaea ten years ago

01:05.299 --> 01:07.211
when you and your friends
released the razorbacks

01:07.235 --> 01:08.802
into the Shepherd compound.

01:08.836 --> 01:11.339
Sam lost both his parents that
day, thanks to you.

01:11.372 --> 01:13.674
ABRAHAM: A beacon was
just activated in Japan.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.177
It must have activated
when her heart stopped,

01:16.210 --> 01:18.146
like a dead man's switch.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.481
These beacons are waking
up thousands of hybrids.

01:20.514 --> 01:21.758
JACKSON: I think
I just found a way

01:21.782 --> 01:23.127
into Abigail's beacon
operating system.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.161
The dead man's switch is okay.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.486
Jackson, you need to get

01:25.519 --> 01:26.530
that dead man's switch
here to command.

01:26.554 --> 01:29.323
There's an access panel
in the electrical room,

01:29.357 --> 01:31.292
but you can't do that.
If you change the filter,

01:31.325 --> 01:32.693
you'll be exposed to the spores.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.228
Spores are down. All clear.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.296
That's your window.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.569
Time to save the world, genius.

01:37.465 --> 01:38.599
Clem had the baby.

01:38.632 --> 01:42.170
And he's perfect.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.243
And in a few hours,
he's gonna save the whole world.

If Max and I did have

I feel like all we do is lose.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.341
But we're so close.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.176
Literally.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.178
Victory lies just
to the east of us.

12:25.212 --> 12:27.480
There you go.

12:27.514 --> 12:28.949
Glass half full.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.084
Always.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.486
We can't lose sight of the end.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.823
Not now.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.291
Not when we're just
about to solve sterility.

12:38.325 --> 12:41.161
All we have to do
is get that child

12:41.194 --> 12:43.130
to the barrier,
and we can end this.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.901
Just think...

12:47.935 --> 12:50.904
I could have another child.

12:50.938 --> 12:54.842
You and Tessa could
start a family.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.110
I had a family 20 years ago.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.916
Never thought I
wanted another one.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.418
Come on.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.188
Don't suppose there are
any diapers under there?

13:08.221 --> 13:11.258
Well, that'd make more
sense than a batting helmet.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.326
Well, little guy,
looks like we're stuck

13:13.360 --> 13:15.095
with dish-towel diapers for now.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.064
He really is beautiful, Clem.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.165
Do you want to hold him?

13:18.198 --> 13:19.599
No, that's okay.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.268
You won't hurt him.
Really, it's okay.

13:22.635 --> 13:26.173
Got it.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.508
Now, why don't you
want to hold the baby?

13:28.541 --> 13:30.277
I said I'm fine.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.013
I've got the battery.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.586
I'm gonna find Jackson and Abe.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.254
Something I said?

13:45.125 --> 13:47.594
What was that about?

13:47.627 --> 13:49.329
We're all gonna die.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.282
Are you seriously asking
why I won't hold a baby?

14:00.140 --> 14:02.075
It's crazy.

14:02.109 --> 14:04.211
We made a little human.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.416
Yeah.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.052
We still have to name
that little human.

14:12.085 --> 14:15.923
I was always a fan of Samuel.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.257
Maybe Sam for short.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.227
We're not naming him after you.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.029
Clementine is a pretty
bad name for a boy.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.098
(radio static
humming, crackling)

14:27.267 --> 14:29.269
Hello. Is anyone there?

14:29.302 --> 14:30.470
(static crackling)

14:30.503 --> 14:32.472
Hello. Do you read me?

14:32.505 --> 14:34.474

14:34.507 --> 14:36.910
Come in. Do you hear me?

14:36.944 --> 14:37.677
IADG Command, come in.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.913
Do you hear me?

14:39.947 --> 14:41.481
IADG Command,
this is Clementine Lewis.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.951
Hello?
Unknown caller, this is IADG.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.085
Are you all right?

14:45.118 --> 14:47.620
This is Clementine Lewis.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.574
I need to talk to Dariela
Kenyatta or Logan Hale.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.628
Clem, is everybody okay?

14:55.662 --> 14:58.131
Given the circumstances.

14:58.165 --> 15:01.401
Uh, listen, whatever you
do, don't leave the plane.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.070
There's hybrids everywhere.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.572
We figured that out.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.975
I've pinpointed
your location here.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.179
We'll get to you soon, Clem.
Sit tight.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.713
Tessa and I will
lead a tac team.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.515
Okay. Thank you.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.684
Please, hurry.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.452

15:47.380 --> 15:49.249
Okay, when you get to the plane,

15:49.282 --> 15:51.151
I want a tight formation
around the targets.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.686
Lay down cover fire as needed
for the escort back to base.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.358
Priority one and
two are the baby

15:58.391 --> 16:00.093
and the dead man's switch.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.429
DARIELA: Copy that.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.763
All right, we got razorbacks.

Okay. Don't panic.

Logan?

16:55.315 --> 16:56.559
There's something
I need to tell you.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.551
What? What happened?

16:58.585 --> 17:01.621
The tac teams are down.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.257
What about Dariela?

17:04.290 --> 17:05.625
Tessa?

17:05.657 --> 17:08.228
There's no response
from anybody.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.175
They're stuck out there
with our best option

17:22.209 --> 17:23.643
for shutting down the beacons.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.478
We need to mobilize
another tac team.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.156
I'm not sure if you've
been paying attention

17:27.180 --> 17:28.523
to current events,
but we are spread thin

17:28.548 --> 17:29.716
all over the globe.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.551
We don't have
another team to send.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.496
Okay, so then we recall
the South American troops.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.288
At the rate the
beacons are activating,

17:35.322 --> 17:36.156
it won't make a difference.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.524
We only need the
dead man's switch

17:37.557 --> 17:39.159
to shut off all of the beacons.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.736
But who knows how and
when that's gonna happen?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.529
If that clock goes down to zero,

17:42.562 --> 17:45.232
no amount of fight is gonna
stop the hybrid spread.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.865
So, I've got to consider
the alternative.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.569
What alternative?

17:49.602 --> 17:52.172
An IADG contingency plan,

17:52.205 --> 17:54.841
coordinating the
military warships

17:54.874 --> 17:56.409
of the G5 countries.

(explosions)

18:09.422 --> 18:11.491
Are you out of your mind?

18:13.460 --> 18:16.663
You're talking about firing
Tomahawk missiles at cities.

18:16.696 --> 18:19.632
To eliminate every last
beacon and hybrid nest.

18:19.666 --> 18:23.236
If you do this...
the loss of life will be catastrophic.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.338
If we don't do this,
the loss of life

18:25.372 --> 18:26.473
will be extinction level.

18:26.506 --> 18:29.242
You think I want
to give that order?

18:31.478 --> 18:33.358
Two hours, 20 minutes
till we hit the threshold.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.684
Your friends have until then.

DARIELA: It's okay.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.553
You're all right,
but we got to move.

19:13.586 --> 19:14.721

Where's the rest of the team?
All dead.

Radio's out.

19:22.795 --> 19:23.795
Mine, too.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.699
We can check the onboard.

19:26.733 --> 19:27.767
Copy.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.302
Cover me.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.644
Logan, come in.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.512
Logan, are you there?

19:39.546 --> 19:41.548
Come in.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.284
Dariela. Is anybody else alive?

19:44.317 --> 19:46.886
Me and Tessa.
We're all that's left.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.897
But we need to start moving
or we're gonna get torn apart.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.991
My monitor shows
one intact vehicle

19:52.024 --> 19:53.793
just to the north
of your location.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.628
If you get to that ATV,

19:55.662 --> 19:56.705
you should have a clear
path to the plane.

19:56.729 --> 19:57.764
Copy that.

19:57.797 --> 19:58.731
Let's move north.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.333
Copy.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.406
(snarling)

20:07.940 --> 20:11.344
Logan, do you copy?
Any word on Tessa or Dariela?

20:11.378 --> 20:12.821
I just got ahold of
them; they're alive.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.957
With any luck,
they're headed towards you with an ATV.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.683
(sighs)

20:16.716 --> 20:17.716
Okay.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.921
That's our ticket back
to the barrier. Maybe.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.823
Still a whole lot of
hybrids between us and it.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.334
ABRAHAM: And they seem
to have an appetite

20:25.358 --> 20:26.959
for moving vehicles.

20:26.993 --> 20:29.462
What are the chances
they will make two trips?

20:29.496 --> 20:31.831
Then we build the
pheromone diffuser.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.266
We've been through that.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.534
We carry it on the ATV.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.011
Lure the hybrids
away, clearing a path

20:36.035 --> 20:37.870
from here to the barrier
for everybody else.

LOGAN: Guys, listen,
whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.309
We have less than two
hours before Garrison

20:42.342 --> 20:45.478
orders missile strikes to take
out the beacons and the nests.

20:45.512 --> 20:48.715
That'll kill hundreds
of thousands of people.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.617
Don't let him do anything.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.385
We'll be there soon.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.526
Sam's diffuser is
our best chance.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.661
Okay. Who's gonna drive? You?

21:01.694 --> 21:03.062
JACKSON: I will.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.365
You build it, I'll drive it.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.736
I'm going, too. Sam, come on.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.271
All that matters is getting
you and the baby to safety.

21:15.742 --> 21:18.345
MITCH: All right, hero.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.079
You pull this off,
I might consider

21:20.112 --> 21:22.415
letting you call me Dad.

21:22.449 --> 21:23.750
For real?

21:23.783 --> 21:25.318
Oh, no.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.929
What do you got there?

21:36.963 --> 21:38.431
Taking a portable?

21:40.533 --> 21:42.902
Figure we might not
be back for a while.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.838
Seemed a shame to leave any
of the good stuff behind.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.781
Funny, automatic weapons
you don't even blink at,

21:54.814 --> 21:57.784
but a newborn baby...

21:57.817 --> 22:00.052
Really? Again with the baby?

22:00.086 --> 22:01.788
This is not a big deal.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.366
Except for you're
kind of making it one.

22:03.390 --> 22:04.657
I think that might be you.

22:04.691 --> 22:05.811
Why won't you hold the baby?

22:09.161 --> 22:10.897
Because you're right.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.600
I know I'm right.
Want to be more specific?

22:15.868 --> 22:18.405
I'm the darkness.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.507
I...

22:20.540 --> 22:23.410
I thought that I was...

22:23.443 --> 22:27.079
doing the right thing,
hunting the Shepherds,

22:27.113 --> 22:29.015
torturing Mansdale,

22:29.048 --> 22:32.885
keeping you Duncan, but...

22:32.919 --> 22:36.923
somewhere along the
way, I lost the ability

22:36.956 --> 22:40.493
to tell the difference.

22:40.527 --> 22:44.964
And that baby is
perfect and innocent.

22:44.997 --> 22:47.700
And I shouldn't be
anywhere near it.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.605
(knocking on door)

22:52.639 --> 22:54.907

22:54.941 --> 22:56.476
Dariela?

23:01.514 --> 23:03.883
All right.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.619
This is the full menu.

23:06.653 --> 23:07.854
Perfect.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.121
You okay?

23:09.155 --> 23:10.890
(groans softly) I'm fine.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.759
You sure?

23:12.792 --> 23:16.028
I'm fine.
I just need to sit down for a bit.

23:16.062 --> 23:19.098
DARIELA: I heard there were some
civilians in need of a rescue.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.533
You made it.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.769
This is where all the
cute guys are hanging out?

23:30.477 --> 23:33.713
You are a sight for sore eyes.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.482
You look beautiful.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.650
And you look horrible.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.654
Let me guess.

23:41.688 --> 23:43.923
You drew the short straw

23:43.956 --> 23:46.058
for driving the ATV as hybrid bait?
Hmm?

23:46.092 --> 23:49.596
No. I volunteered.

23:49.629 --> 23:50.839
No matter what
name you're using,

23:50.863 --> 23:53.032
you always got to play hero.

23:55.067 --> 23:57.003
(baby cooing softly)

and we'll be set.

24:47.086 --> 24:51.223

then when we're ready, poke a small hole,

24:51.257 --> 24:54.561
and when the scent hits the air,
we'll be the hybrid Pied Piper.

24:54.594 --> 24:57.697
You sure know your hybrids.

24:57.730 --> 25:00.166

25:00.199 --> 25:01.834

25:07.607 --> 25:10.777
Every day since I left Pangaea,

25:10.810 --> 25:13.112
all I thought about
was tracking you down.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.615

the death of my parents.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.617
I had a plan for
the day I found you.

25:17.650 --> 25:20.119
I knew exactly what
I was gonna say,

25:20.152 --> 25:23.690
exactly what I was going to do.

25:23.723 --> 25:26.893
But what I didn't plan for...

25:26.926 --> 25:28.661
was Clem.

25:31.097 --> 25:34.867
Holding my son...

25:34.901 --> 25:38.004
it changes things,
in ways I didn't expect.

25:40.272 --> 25:43.209
I'm not sure if
I can explain it.

25:45.612 --> 25:47.580
You don't have to.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.327
Good to go?

26:01.360 --> 26:02.862

switch, huh?

26:22.281 --> 26:23.850
Not very impressive, is it?

26:26.853 --> 26:28.888
You think maybe we
should rename it?

26:28.921 --> 26:32.358
Since, you know,
it didn't come from a man,

26:32.391 --> 26:34.994
and also your sister's not dead.

26:35.027 --> 26:38.264

want, okay?
