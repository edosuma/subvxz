02:08.270 --> 02:10.707
<i>This is the
process of starting, simply enough.</i>

02:10.740 --> 02:13.243
<i>It's gotta happen eventually,
but it might not be tomorrow.</i>

02:13.276 --> 02:16.847
<i>Meanwhile, over on the west side of
the city, things were good for a bit,</i>

02:16.880 --> 02:19.950
<i>and now we're starting to see the
beginnings of it here in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

05:24.000 --> 05:24.968
Morning.

05:25.335 --> 05:26.336
Hey.

05:29.339 --> 05:32.075
- How was your weekend?
- It was all right, I guess.

05:35.011 --> 05:37.914
Hey, the grosses,
we need them printed out,

05:37.947 --> 05:40.216
maybe by rank
and also by market.

07:36.332 --> 07:39.202
WME came back
with 250K and three points.

07:39.235 --> 07:42.540
- Gross?
- Adjusted gross. We can get them down.

07:45.443 --> 07:47.411
- I can check with biz affairs over there...
- What time is he in?

07:47.445 --> 07:49.212
And we can't give him an "And."

07:49.245 --> 07:51.047
- What?
- He can't get an "And."

07:51.080 --> 07:52.583
He gets a single card.

07:52.616 --> 07:55.051
I get it. I get it.

08:13.102 --> 08:14.137
No bagels.

08:14.170 --> 08:15.171
What'd you get?

08:18.241 --> 08:20.076
Hey, check your in-box.

08:20.109 --> 08:22.011
They want to
move the test screening up.

08:22.045 --> 08:23.279
- Wait, Los Angeles?
- Yeah.

08:23.313 --> 08:24.415
No. What?

08:26.450 --> 08:29.018
Morning. His schedule.

08:29.052 --> 08:30.153
How was your weekend?

08:30.521 --> 08:32.087
Amazing. Yours?

08:32.523 --> 08:33.457
I was here.

08:34.525 --> 08:36.259
Oh, right.
Thanks for that.

08:38.529 --> 08:41.130
Wait, what? Tomorrow?
We had it on the calendar for Friday.

08:43.833 --> 08:46.269
Office of...
One moment, please.

08:46.302 --> 08:48.506
- Office of the chairman.
- I have Tony on one.

08:48.539 --> 08:51.341
- Let me see if I have...
- Office of...

08:51.374 --> 08:53.811
I don't have him right now, but I'll
have him return as soon as possible.

08:53.844 --> 08:55.245
I'm sorry,
I don't have him right now.

08:55.278 --> 08:57.146
- Thank you.
- Is he in yet?

08:57.180 --> 08:59.048
- No, not till 10:00.
- Look, we're all set

08:59.082 --> 09:01.585
for Friday and... Okay. Okay.

09:03.286 --> 09:05.355
He can leave tonight.
We'll clear his schedule.

09:05.389 --> 09:07.525
I'll get her
into the travel now.

09:07.558 --> 09:08.492
Okay, thanks.

09:13.497 --> 09:16.132
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Gary. Hi. Just need a confirmation.

09:16.165 --> 09:18.167
<i>Yep. It's right here in front of me.</i>

09:18.201 --> 09:20.437
Uh, yes, out of Teterboro
tonight at 11:00 p.m.

09:20.471 --> 09:23.172
And what time does that
get him into Los Angeles?

09:23.574 --> 09:25.409
<i>Wheels down at 2:15.</i>

09:25.442 --> 09:27.478
Okay, great.
And as of right now,

09:27.511 --> 09:29.312
there are
two additional passengers.

09:29.345 --> 09:31.247
- <i>All set.</i>
- Okay, great. Thank you.

09:31.281 --> 09:32.282
<i>Thank you.</i>

09:40.290 --> 09:43.293
Bill, hi. I'll need the suite ready
for tonight, plus two additional rooms.

09:44.595 --> 09:46.296
- John, hi.
- <i>Hey.</i>

09:46.329 --> 09:47.565
1:30 a.m., Van Nuys.

09:47.598 --> 09:50.166
<i>I'm not sure I can...</i>

09:50.199 --> 09:53.437
I'm sorry. I didn't catch that?

09:53.470 --> 09:55.706
Oh, okay, uh...

09:55.739 --> 09:57.541
Well, how are you feeling now?

09:57.575 --> 10:00.444
<i>I'm really not sure
I can tonight.</i>

10:00.477 --> 10:03.112
Okay, I understand.
Don't worry. I'll sort it out.

10:03.146 --> 10:05.315
<i>I'm just a little dizzy
and my stomach is...</i>

10:05.348 --> 10:07.183
Okay, you look after yourself.

10:07.216 --> 10:08.652
<i>Yeah, I'm definitely gonna
stay in bed.</i>

10:08.686 --> 10:10.286
Okay. Take care.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.622
I got your e-mail.

10:13.457 --> 10:15.459
Well, what about the manuscript?

10:15.492 --> 10:18.161
We know you have
the manuscript, right?

10:18.194 --> 10:19.663
Hi, Javier.
John had to call in sick

10:19.697 --> 10:21.498
and we need a car
at Van Nuys at 1:30 a.m.

10:21.532 --> 10:23.400
Oh. Okay.
Well, is it watermarked?

10:23.434 --> 10:24.602
<i>No. My daughter,
it's her quincea√±era.</i>

10:26.369 --> 10:29.372
- Jesus.
- Where are those new pages?

10:29.406 --> 10:31.274
I want those new pages
before I get on the plane.

10:31.307 --> 10:32.676
He promised them first thing.

10:32.710 --> 10:35.379
Is there any way for you
to rearrange that?

10:35.412 --> 10:37.280
Apparently HBO
didn't pick up her pilot.

10:37.313 --> 10:39.248
- Where are we at?
- 200K and two points.

10:39.282 --> 10:41.217
- We can get them down.
- That's bullshit.

10:45.389 --> 10:48.425
- Sorry, what?
- <i>My brother can help. I'll be there.</i>

10:48.459 --> 10:51.260
Okay. Great.
Thank you so much.

10:51.294 --> 10:54.498
<i>Hang on. Let me get this down.
1:30 at Van Nuys.</i>

10:54.531 --> 10:57.300
- <i>Then straight to the hotel?</i>
- Yes, straight to the hotel.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.402
The Peninsula.

10:59.302 --> 11:00.269
Okay, thanks.

11:15.284 --> 11:17.688
"Boom. Gunshot.

11:17.721 --> 11:20.356
Bonnie has been shot through the back.
Her body lurches forward."

11:41.779 --> 11:44.247
That script change
you wanted in the first act?

11:44.280 --> 11:47.316
It has ripple effects
all the way down the line.

11:47.350 --> 11:49.687
- Even Nick is saying it makes no sense.
- Hey.

11:54.858 --> 11:56.192
The new draft.

11:59.697 --> 12:03.332
She's gotta get out of here if
we're gonna get her to that screening.

12:13.610 --> 12:15.244
What?

12:15.278 --> 12:16.513
He wants you
on the Los Angeles trip.

12:17.581 --> 12:18.716
When?

12:18.749 --> 12:19.817
Tonight.

12:20.517 --> 12:21.452
Fuck.

12:22.786 --> 12:24.220
Have fun.

12:26.355 --> 12:29.225
The car leaves at 9:00.
Wheels up at Teterboro at 11:00.

12:36.767 --> 12:38.602
Does 6:00 p.m. work then?

12:42.473 --> 12:44.742
Okay, great. Perfect.

12:44.775 --> 12:47.778
And I'll shoot you an e-mail
with everything and the details.

12:47.811 --> 12:49.680
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- Okay, thank you.

13:02.358 --> 13:04.728
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi, we spoke earlier.

13:04.762 --> 13:08.465
Listen, his schedule has shifted
and he no longer has the afternoon.

13:08.499 --> 13:10.299
- <i>Oh.</i>
- Does 7:00 p.m. work?

13:11.101 --> 13:12.736
<i>Yeah, I can do 7:00 p.m.</i>

13:12.770 --> 13:13.871
Great.

13:14.905 --> 13:16.774
Perfect.

13:16.807 --> 13:19.510
- <i>Still at the hotel, or...</i>
- Yes.

13:19.543 --> 13:21.545
- The Peninsula. Beverly Hills.
- <i>Okay.</i>

13:22.546 --> 13:24.648
<i>Will I be able
to find him easily?</i>

13:24.681 --> 13:28.385
Yes, yes. There is a
restaurant inside the hotel.

13:28.418 --> 13:30.420
<i>Cool. Um, where do I park?</i>

13:47.137 --> 13:48.572
Ow.

15:39.549 --> 15:41.752
- What?
- Can you deal with this?

15:41.785 --> 15:43.854
- Wh... What is it?
- The wife.

15:44.788 --> 15:45.722
Why me?

15:48.692 --> 15:49.660
Fine.

15:53.764 --> 15:56.700
- Hello?
- <i>He blocked the cards again.</i>

15:56.733 --> 15:59.002
- Sorry?
- <i>The credit cards. They're blocked.</i>

15:59.036 --> 16:00.704
- <i>All of them.</i>
- They're blocked?

16:00.737 --> 16:01.972
<i>He must have canceled them.</i>

16:03.206 --> 16:07.477
I'm... Surely not.
Let me get in touch with the bank. It's...

16:07.511 --> 16:09.880
<i>It's not the bank. It's him.
He's doing this.</i>

16:11.848 --> 16:14.851
I mean, you have
your personal cards, right?

16:14.885 --> 16:17.054
<i>That's not the point.
You're not listening to me.</i>

16:17.087 --> 16:19.990
I... I really think
that this is a misunderstanding.

16:20.023 --> 16:22.793
<i>Are you listening to me?
You're not listening to what I'm saying.</i>

16:22.826 --> 16:24.962
No, I am. I'm just...
I'm trying to help.

16:24.995 --> 16:27.531
<i>Why is he doing this to me? Why?</i>

16:28.298 --> 16:30.834
I really don't... Uh...

16:30.867 --> 16:33.670
<i>Why is he doing this to me?</i>

16:33.704 --> 16:35.672
- Uh...
- <i>He can't treat me like this.</i>

16:38.008 --> 16:39.643
Are you... Are you still there?

17:17.347 --> 17:19.883
<i>Now what did you say to her?</i>

17:19.915 --> 17:22.685
<i>What did you say...
What the fuck did you say to her?</i>

17:22.719 --> 17:25.888
<i>Filling her head with this
bullshit is not your job.</i>

17:25.922 --> 17:29.026
<i>I thought the last girl was bad,
but you have somehow</i>

17:29.059 --> 17:30.794
- <i>lowered the bar even further.</i>
- Hey, how'd it go?

17:30.827 --> 17:32.896
<i>They told me you were smart.</i>

17:32.929 --> 17:36.900
- <i>Act like it.</i>
- No way! Oh! That is awesome.

17:36.933 --> 17:39.102
<i>Go back to the one thing you're good at.
Ordering salads.</i>

17:39.136 --> 17:40.771
Yeah.

17:40.804 --> 17:43.173
- <i>Focus on that.</i>
- I'm sorry.

17:43.206 --> 17:44.741
<i>Don't waste my time.</i>

18:26.850 --> 18:29.820
You should add, "I appreciate the
opportunity to work for this company

18:29.853 --> 18:31.588
and will not
let you down again."

18:32.989 --> 18:34.691
- You okay?
- Yeah, of course.

18:58.215 --> 19:01.885
They're begging us for
three more weeks, but I don't see...

19:01.918 --> 19:05.655
...soft money out of the fund
over there.

19:05.689 --> 19:08.158
We've got all that money
sitting in Cologne... like, two million.

19:08.191 --> 19:11.128
I don't think we can push more than
a week. Can you get into it with them?

19:11.161 --> 19:13.063
I can try. But who knows?

19:27.777 --> 19:30.881
- Mom?
- <i>What? I can't hear you.</i>

19:30.914 --> 19:33.283
Mom. Can you...
Can you hear me now?

19:33.316 --> 19:36.052
<i>Well, where are you?
Shouldn't you be at work?</i>

19:36.086 --> 19:38.822
- I'm at work.
- <i>In the office?</i>

19:38.855 --> 19:41.158
Yeah, of course.
Of course I'm at the office.

19:41.191 --> 19:44.661
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- Well, I don't... Nothing.

19:47.330 --> 19:48.665
<i>Are you okay?</i>

19:49.866 --> 19:51.735
Yeah, I'm fine.

19:51.768 --> 19:53.069
<i>It was your father's birthday
yesterday.</i>

19:55.805 --> 19:58.975
<i>He knows you're busy. Maybe call him
tonight though, if you get the chance.</i>

20:00.243 --> 20:02.846
I... I will.

20:02.879 --> 20:05.215
I don't know, for some reason
I thought it was tomorrow.

20:06.082 --> 20:07.918
<i>He knows you're busy, sweetie.</i>

20:51.562 --> 20:52.729
Excuse me.

21:15.018 --> 21:16.953
Possibly.
What was this regarding?

21:18.888 --> 21:20.156
Okay, one moment. I'll check.

21:38.275 --> 21:39.342
Sorry. Which carrier?

21:40.910 --> 21:42.145
I'm sorry. Can you spell that?

21:43.313 --> 21:44.814
He'll be just a moment.

21:44.848 --> 21:47.083
- What?
- Uh, just a moment.

21:47.117 --> 21:49.886
- What?
- Uh, Tony is on the line.

21:49.919 --> 21:53.023
He wants to discuss this week's theater
expansion. Should I put him through?

21:53.056 --> 21:55.292
I don't need the details.
Just have him e-mail me.

21:55.325 --> 21:56.359
- Okay.
- We're done.

22:05.935 --> 22:07.003
Send her in.

22:08.371 --> 22:09.806
Okay, you can come through.

22:24.087 --> 22:26.156
- Uh, this way. Yeah.
- Oh.

22:39.002 --> 22:41.071
Do you think you could
make that work on your side?

22:41.104 --> 22:42.440
If so,
I'll make it work on ours.

22:44.442 --> 22:47.411
Yeah.

22:47.445 --> 22:49.279
Yes, get back to me. Thank you.

23:05.028 --> 23:05.995
Thank you.

23:17.006 --> 23:18.007
Hey.

23:19.075 --> 23:20.310
He... He just stepped out.

23:22.145 --> 23:23.913
Uh, he's in the screening room.

23:25.949 --> 23:28.184
I'm not sure.

23:28.218 --> 23:32.989
Listen, drop by at 3:00.
He may have a window from 3:00 to 4:00.

23:33.022 --> 23:36.226
I mean, I can't promise
anything, but I'll try and get you in.

23:38.261 --> 23:41.297
Great. Thanks, man.
Catch you later.

23:59.383 --> 24:01.017
This is turkey. I said chicken.

24:02.352 --> 24:03.421
Forget it.

24:24.140 --> 24:27.177
- Office of the...
- <i>Does he have a moment?</i>

24:27.210 --> 24:31.181
Yes, certainly. I can put you
straight through. One moment.

24:31.214 --> 24:32.516
Hey.

24:32.550 --> 24:35.051
Oh, no. Not again.

24:37.153 --> 24:40.056
You're on.

24:40.089 --> 24:42.493
Oh, wow.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.396
- Who is it?
- Shh, shh.

24:51.034 --> 24:52.001
Oh, my God.

24:53.136 --> 24:54.103
Oh, wow.

24:57.106 --> 24:59.075
Oh! Huh.

25:07.317 --> 25:09.386
Brutal. Brutal.

25:11.655 --> 25:14.257
No.

25:35.546 --> 25:38.147
How do I get out of unscripted?

25:38.181 --> 25:39.450
I'm serious.

25:40.618 --> 25:43.052
- Have you spoken to Jonathan?
- In production?

25:43.086 --> 25:44.488
Yeah.

25:44.522 --> 25:45.656
I heard
he wants to leave.

25:45.689 --> 25:48.124
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

25:48.157 --> 25:50.193
Maybe he can put in
a good word for you.

25:50.226 --> 25:51.294
You never know.

25:53.296 --> 25:56.199
No, he'll hire externally.
There's no way he's going to move me over.

26:21.324 --> 26:23.192
Uh...

26:30.401 --> 26:33.437
What's happened? Where'd he go?

26:33.470 --> 26:35.271
Huh?

26:45.683 --> 26:47.083
<i>S√≠.</i> Yeah.

26:56.594 --> 26:57.628
Uh...

26:59.630 --> 27:03.199
No, no, no. It's... It's not...
It's not your fault. It's...

27:03.232 --> 27:06.470
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- It's not your fault. Um, I'll fix it.

27:06.503 --> 27:09.440
Uh...

27:14.177 --> 27:16.380
I'm sorry.
Who are you looking for?

27:16.413 --> 27:19.248
No, I don't think
she works here anymore.

27:19.282 --> 27:21.351
Um, hang on one second.
Please hold.

27:31.662 --> 27:32.763
Hi.

27:32.796 --> 27:35.699
Uh, hi.
It's... This is yours.

27:39.235 --> 27:40.471
Um, it's... Um...

27:43.440 --> 27:44.408
Thanks.

27:53.651 --> 27:55.519
Yes. Okay.

28:05.596 --> 28:07.698
Yes, he wanted to make
sure Brian got the invitation.

28:10.333 --> 28:14.170
Of course, any donation will be
appreciated, but the seats are comped.

28:18.274 --> 28:19.275
Thanks.

29:03.352 --> 29:05.321
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hi, it's me again.

29:05.354 --> 29:07.725
Yes. The last two checks
don't have a name or anything,

29:07.758 --> 29:09.693
just the dollar amount.

29:09.727 --> 29:11.528
<i>Uh, ignore it.</i>

29:11.562 --> 29:13.530
Okay. And will he know
what it's for?

29:13.564 --> 29:14.565
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:16.433 --> 29:17.501
Okay.

29:18.367 --> 29:19.570
<i>He'll know.</i>

29:19.603 --> 29:20.704
Okay, sure. Thank you.

29:44.661 --> 29:45.662
Let's go.

29:48.799 --> 29:50.701
Can you watch him
for a second?

29:50.734 --> 29:51.735
Yep.

29:54.370 --> 29:56.607
Hey.

29:59.777 --> 30:01.344
- What's that?
- Your s... suit.

30:01.378 --> 30:03.380
I don't need this suit.

30:03.413 --> 30:06.416
They misplaced the DCP.

30:06.450 --> 30:09.419
- Wait. What?
- It hasn't arrived yet.

30:09.453 --> 30:12.355
- Well, isn't there a tracking number?
- I'll get them on the phone.

30:12.389 --> 30:13.624
He's gonna freak.

30:16.593 --> 30:19.863
Hey.
You do not bring the kids here.

30:25.435 --> 30:26.703
Jesus Christ.

31:01.772 --> 31:02.739
Now you do it.

31:10.547 --> 31:11.481
Louder!

31:35.639 --> 31:36.673
Hey.

31:37.207 --> 31:38.508
Hi.

33:57.714 --> 33:59.750
No, he threw that one
on Weekend Read.

34:01.785 --> 34:03.587
Um, Friday.

34:08.358 --> 34:10.027
Mm. I don't know. Let me check.

34:18.768 --> 34:21.004
Well, get back to me. Yeah?

34:21.838 --> 34:22.839
Thanks.

34:44.194 --> 34:45.929
But when was it
supposed to arrive?

34:51.201 --> 34:53.136
- Hi.
- <i>The new assistant is here.</i>

34:55.672 --> 34:58.809
- What address do you have?
- Okay, uh, hang on.

34:58.842 --> 35:01.578
Right. I'm not sure
what happened there. Um...

35:03.847 --> 35:06.149
- Sorry, who?
- Okay. Let me check on that. I'll get back to you.

35:06.183 --> 35:08.386
<i>A girl.
She says she starts today.</i>

35:08.419 --> 35:11.721
Uh, hey.
There's a girl waiting at reception.

35:11.755 --> 35:14.157
She says that she's supposed
to start here today.

35:14.191 --> 35:16.026
Working here? With us?
Where's she from?

35:17.928 --> 35:18.995
Where's she from?

35:19.830 --> 35:20.864
<i>Idaho.</i>

35:21.865 --> 35:23.633
- Idaho.
- Idaho?

35:25.068 --> 35:26.937
Is that the one he met
in Sun Valley?

35:30.040 --> 35:33.910
Oh, her. She's been here before.
A few times. Uh, send her in.

35:44.154 --> 35:45.088
Send her in.

35:56.900 --> 35:58.168
- Can I?
- Yeah, take one.

35:58.902 --> 36:00.003
Cool.

36:07.244 --> 36:09.179
Thanks. Okay.

36:10.180 --> 36:12.782
So, here and here.

36:13.183 --> 36:15.152
And this one here.

36:18.922 --> 36:21.992
Here and here. Initial here.
Sign there.

36:23.927 --> 36:24.928
Thanks.

36:27.097 --> 36:29.032
Do I need a...

36:29.065 --> 36:30.734
Do I need a lawyer
or something?

36:31.735 --> 36:32.802
Do you have a lawyer?

36:46.049 --> 36:47.083
Is it nice?

36:49.953 --> 36:50.954
Sorry?

36:52.155 --> 36:53.890
The hotel.

36:53.924 --> 36:55.025
Oh. Yeah.

36:55.959 --> 36:56.993
Cool.

36:58.962 --> 37:00.830
- It's really nice. Yeah.
- Oh.

37:01.932 --> 37:03.733
Is this where they put
you when you started?

37:04.935 --> 37:06.102
- No.
- Oh.

37:07.037 --> 37:08.305
Where'd they put you?

37:10.240 --> 37:11.875
Um, they didn't.

37:15.078 --> 37:16.112
Oh.

37:21.851 --> 37:23.787
So, you're from Idaho,
right?

37:24.321 --> 37:27.157
Yeah. Um, Boise.

37:28.191 --> 37:29.125
You been?

37:29.993 --> 37:31.795
Mm-mmm. No.

37:31.828 --> 37:32.862
There's not much to see.

37:35.198 --> 37:38.868
So, did you...
did you come straight from there, or...

37:38.902 --> 37:43.974
Yeah. I mean, there was this whole
conference thing a while back.

37:44.007 --> 37:46.142
- I was working there.
- Oh, okay.

37:46.176 --> 37:49.012
Yeah. Just waitressing.
But I've worked in film before.

37:50.880 --> 37:52.148
- Oh.
- Yeah.

37:52.182 --> 37:54.150
I did some work
on this movie

37:54.184 --> 37:55.852
that shot in
Salt Lake City, so...

37:56.886 --> 37:58.021
I know a bit.

38:02.993 --> 38:04.227
My uncle
is in craft services.

38:15.606 --> 38:17.974
Yeah, but the sub log says
it came in to her.

38:20.210 --> 38:22.178
It didn't?
I'm looking at it right now.

38:23.913 --> 38:24.981
It's right in front of me.

38:26.916 --> 38:28.084
No, he hasn't seen it yet.

38:31.221 --> 38:34.824
Well, then you should change the sub
log, because if he sees that...

38:37.260 --> 38:38.895
Yep.

38:40.696 --> 38:42.759
Goldman hasn‚Äôt sent the revised deck.

38:43.135 --> 38:45.971
They said he wants to add four more films.
And talk about the library

38:46.554 --> 38:49.599
I haven‚Äôt had a chance
to revise the report.

38:50.100 --> 38:53.353
But he can add ten more films,
the problem is...

38:53.603 --> 38:56.023
the domestic marketing. And of course,
the overhead fee.

38:56.314 --> 38:57.930
The talent pool.

38:58.013 --> 38:59.266
He still insists on a gross fee

38:59.349 --> 39:01.117
for the executive producer fees.

39:01.403 --> 39:02.905
But we will be executive producers, no?

39:03.071 --> 39:05.824
But not included in the pool,
according to‚Ä¶

39:12.372 --> 39:13.916
And what happened
to the release requirement?

39:13.999 --> 39:15.542
Still holding at 100 screens.

39:15.625 --> 39:18.503
- We told them we need a thousand.
- I know.

39:40.458 --> 39:41.425
Hi.

39:43.026 --> 39:44.060
Hi.

39:46.697 --> 39:49.065
Um, his three o'clock is here.

39:54.438 --> 39:55.473
Where is he?

39:56.407 --> 39:57.941
Uh, he's in a personal.

40:29.305 --> 40:31.374
Understand Mr. Li had
agreed to remain this extra day

40:31.409 --> 40:34.043
in the hopes that we could come
to some general agreement.

40:34.077 --> 40:37.347
- Again, I sincerely apologize.
- We will need to address all these issues another time.

40:37.381 --> 40:40.150
Absolutely. Again,
I apologize for the miscommunication.

40:40.183 --> 40:42.486
I will have the office reach
out to you as soon as possible.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.187
I can't thank you enough for...

40:55.533 --> 40:56.933
What?

40:59.102 --> 41:00.236
She wants you.

41:02.305 --> 41:04.007
Just say he's in
an important meeting.

41:04.040 --> 41:05.141
He'll get back to her
as soon as he can.

41:05.175 --> 41:07.076
No, say he's in a screening.

41:07.110 --> 41:08.446
Something that isn't
so easy to interrupt.

41:09.413 --> 41:11.047
I'm not gonna lie to her.

41:16.420 --> 41:18.422
- Hi.
- <i>Where is he?</i>

41:20.056 --> 41:21.759
I'm sorry,
but I don't have him right now.

41:21.792 --> 41:24.528
<i>Oh, right. Where is he?</i>

41:24.562 --> 41:28.298
Uh, I... I'm not sure.
I don't have him right now.

41:28.331 --> 41:31.134
- <i>Who is he with?</i>
- I... I can get...

41:31.167 --> 41:34.103
<i>Just tell me where he is
and who he is with.</i>

41:34.137 --> 41:35.473
- I... I... I'm not...
- <i>Just where and who.</i>

41:35.506 --> 41:37.273
I really don't know.
I don't have him.

41:37.307 --> 41:38.576
- I'm so...
- <i>Fine.</i>

42:57.488 --> 42:59.490
Well, I promise
to give you a 15-minute warning

42:59.523 --> 43:00.658
before he walks
into your office.

43:02.393 --> 43:03.460
That's the best I can do.

43:05.563 --> 43:07.531
Okay. Catch you later.

43:09.165 --> 43:10.501
I don't know about
that final scene.

43:10.534 --> 43:12.570
Let's just see
what he has to say.

43:12.603 --> 43:14.170
- Has he got the latest draft?
- Yeah.

43:14.203 --> 43:15.472
I thought
there was comp coverage.

43:15.506 --> 43:17.441
It's just
the last two scenes.

43:17.474 --> 43:19.309
And the flashback?

43:19.342 --> 43:20.511
Gone. Right?

43:20.544 --> 43:21.879
I wouldn't sit there.

43:21.912 --> 43:23.714
Never sit on the couch.

43:26.684 --> 43:28.351
Hello! Where is he?

43:32.389 --> 43:34.190
Uh, where'd you take her?

43:34.223 --> 43:36.560
- What?
- The girl. Where'd you take her?

43:37.226 --> 43:38.294
The Mark.

43:39.262 --> 43:40.229
The Mark.

43:45.669 --> 43:48.171
- It's like that time in Cannes.
- That was in London, dude.

43:48.204 --> 43:49.673
I would remember where it was.
It was Cannes.

43:49.707 --> 43:51.675
Seriously,
you would not remember,

43:51.709 --> 43:54.411
given how late to the du Cap
you and what's-his-name were.

43:54.445 --> 43:57.448
- Who is... Who is this?
- It was Cannes! Jeffrey was there, remember?

43:58.515 --> 44:00.149
I'm sure we can add her.

44:02.251 --> 44:03.487
And for the auction, yeah.

44:06.523 --> 44:09.426
Uh, yes, a lunch
and a script consultation.

44:11.562 --> 44:12.596
Yes, in New York.

44:15.633 --> 44:19.369
Uh, okay. Let me ask him and I
will get back to you. Okay. Thanks.

44:44.595 --> 44:48.399
He won't make it to the theater
in time. Should we just cancel or...

44:48.432 --> 44:51.367
- It starts at 7:30.
- Okay, he's not going to be happy.

44:52.670 --> 44:54.738
We could push for an earlier
wheels-up, but we'd have to...

44:54.772 --> 44:56.507
Shoot him an e-mail,
see if you get a response.

45:47.491 --> 45:49.292
Can I help you?

45:49.325 --> 45:50.828
Uh, no, I just work
in the other building.

46:16.086 --> 46:19.556
Hi. I was wondering
if someone's free.

46:19.590 --> 46:23.627
- I remember you. I did your onboarding.
- Oh, yeah.

46:23.660 --> 46:25.562
I don't see anything on
the books with you, though.

46:26.797 --> 46:28.297
Uh, no.

46:29.700 --> 46:32.402
Okay. Have a seat.
There's a chair over there.

46:33.403 --> 46:34.404
Thank you.

46:43.781 --> 46:45.348
He's in there. Just go in.

46:48.852 --> 46:50.654
Here it is.
There isn't much there.

47:01.832 --> 47:03.600
- If Don calls, let me know.
- Of course.

47:14.878 --> 47:16.547
- He can see you now.
- Oh. Thank you.

47:46.944 --> 47:48.612
- Welcome. Have a seat.
- Hi.

47:58.789 --> 48:00.390
Did you want to
take your coat off?

48:01.625 --> 48:02.793
Uh...

48:03.560 --> 48:05.429
Uh, no. No, it's okay.

48:08.498 --> 48:09.833
Actually, maybe just my scarf.

48:13.871 --> 48:15.772
Yeah.
Looks more comfortable.

48:20.777 --> 48:21.812
Um...

48:23.513 --> 48:25.482
I... I didn't know
who to come to.

48:25.515 --> 48:28.452
In that case,
you came to the right place. So...

48:32.823 --> 48:35.759
- I mean, it's just. It's just...
- Hey.

48:35.792 --> 48:38.528
Whatever's going on, you can tell me.
That's what I'm here for.

48:43.767 --> 48:46.703
Um, there's this girl
who arrived today.

48:48.672 --> 48:49.840
She...

48:51.475 --> 48:52.576
She's from Boise.

48:53.076 --> 48:54.912
Mm-hmm. Okay.

48:54.945 --> 48:57.648
And she's very pretty.

48:58.682 --> 49:00.951
- And she's young.
- Okay.

49:00.984 --> 49:05.555
She was waitressing in Sun
Valley when she met him.

49:06.757 --> 49:08.725
And he just liked her,
apparently,

49:08.759 --> 49:10.928
and just gave her
an assistant job.

49:12.496 --> 49:13.597
And?

49:15.732 --> 49:20.237
Well, she doesn't have any
experience, or not much experience,

49:20.270 --> 49:22.973
and he just flew her over from Boise
and is putting her up at a hotel?

49:32.749 --> 49:34.685
She's very young.

49:34.718 --> 49:36.820
Is she too young
to be an assistant?

49:36.853 --> 49:39.690
No. No, no. Uh...

49:41.792 --> 49:43.593
Well, okay, um...

49:46.029 --> 49:52.636
And this girl, has she done
something to make you... uh...

49:52.669 --> 49:54.972
Do you suspect that she's done
something to harm the company?

49:55.005 --> 49:59.810
No. No, no, no. I mean, I don't...
I don't think so.

49:59.843 --> 50:03.914
I dropped her off at The Mark,
the hotel.

50:03.947 --> 50:07.884
- Uh-huh.
- We had a reservation for her and I left her there.

50:07.918 --> 50:10.554
- Yes.
- And when I came back to the office...

50:11.588 --> 50:12.789
he was... he was gone.

50:15.959 --> 50:17.694
And he was gone
for quite a while.

50:17.728 --> 50:19.963
And you were
looking for him?

50:19.997 --> 50:23.967
No, he was just...
he was gone and she was gone

50:24.001 --> 50:26.103
and they were both
at The Mark apparently.

50:26.136 --> 50:27.537
Apparently?

50:29.573 --> 50:31.708
I mean,
that's what everyone said.

50:31.742 --> 50:33.310
Who said?

50:33.343 --> 50:37.781
Um, the...
the production executives...

50:38.815 --> 50:40.050
and all the assistants.

50:41.985 --> 50:44.621
- I mean, they were just laughing about it.
- They were laughing?

50:45.922 --> 50:47.024
Yeah.

50:50.794 --> 50:52.896
Okay, maybe let's back up here a bit.
What did she say to you?

50:53.797 --> 50:54.931
- Who?
- The girl.

50:56.066 --> 50:57.701
The girl?

50:57.734 --> 50:59.636
Uh... Nothing.

50:59.669 --> 51:01.838
Nothing?
Have you spoken to her?

51:01.872 --> 51:05.942
No. I mean, just in the cab
on our way to The Mark.

51:05.976 --> 51:08.578
But I haven't
talked to her since.

51:08.612 --> 51:11.048
- Since when?
- I haven't seen her since.

51:11.081 --> 51:13.150
When I found out,
I came straight here.

51:13.183 --> 51:15.052
Sorry. What did you...
what did you find out?

51:22.159 --> 51:23.693
What... What can we do?

51:26.096 --> 51:27.097
Do about what?

51:32.235 --> 51:33.670
About the girl.

51:34.905 --> 51:36.073
Okay, let's...

51:38.141 --> 51:42.846
Bear with me here. So,
a new assistant arrives from out of town,

51:42.879 --> 51:45.082
- and she's being put up at The Mark...
- Mm-hmm.

51:45.115 --> 51:47.017
...and your boss at some point
left the office.

51:47.050 --> 51:49.052
To meet her at The Mark, yes.

51:49.086 --> 51:50.987
Yes, according, apparently,
to the jokes at the office.

51:54.024 --> 51:55.926
- Yeah, I guess, yeah.
- Okay.

51:56.793 --> 51:58.829
Okay, so that's...
that's it?

52:01.031 --> 52:02.032
That's why you came in?

52:08.839 --> 52:12.109
And... And I found...
an earring.

52:12.142 --> 52:13.844
- In the office today.
- An earring?

52:15.145 --> 52:16.179
By his couch.

52:17.848 --> 52:20.717
- And a hair tie on the floor last week.
- Ah.

52:22.018 --> 52:26.223
Forgive me, but are you often,
um, cleaning things off his floor?

52:26.256 --> 52:28.158
I mean, we have a janitorial
crew, right?

52:28.925 --> 52:30.093
I'm supposed to tidy up.

52:32.896 --> 52:35.632
And... And a girl came
and... and...

52:37.000 --> 52:39.002
she picked the earring up.

52:39.035 --> 52:41.171
I've never seen her before,
and it was hers.

52:43.039 --> 52:44.040
Okay.

52:45.041 --> 52:47.978
Sorry.

52:49.913 --> 52:50.981
Just a sec.

52:52.483 --> 52:55.085
Hey.

52:55.118 --> 52:57.821
No. No need.
We're fine, really.

52:59.956 --> 53:00.957
What?

53:05.762 --> 53:07.898
You think I give a shit
about the Rangers?

53:11.768 --> 53:12.736
Yeah.

53:14.104 --> 53:15.672
All right,
we'll pick this up later.

53:17.274 --> 53:18.909
Okay.

53:23.213 --> 53:25.015
Sorry about that. Uh...

53:28.285 --> 53:29.252
Where were we?

53:33.023 --> 53:33.990
The earring.

53:39.796 --> 53:42.199
Okay, listen,
you're relatively new to the company.

53:42.232 --> 53:44.502
I mean, I've been working
here for nearly two months.

53:44.535 --> 53:46.203
Five weeks.

53:46.236 --> 53:48.338
- Well, yeah.
- And you're under a lot of stress.

53:48.371 --> 53:50.974
Entry-level jobs in this
industry are tough, right?

53:51.007 --> 53:52.876
Long hours?

53:52.909 --> 53:56.079
- Yeah...
- First one in. Last one out.

53:56.112 --> 53:58.114
- Well, yeah.
- I bet you haven't seen your friends in a while.

54:00.283 --> 54:03.954
Um, I... I missed
my dad's birthday.

54:03.987 --> 54:04.988
That's tough.

54:08.392 --> 54:10.327
- Yeah, but that's...
- Where'd you go to college?

54:11.328 --> 54:14.297
- Uh, Northwestern.
- It's a great school.

54:14.331 --> 54:16.166
It's a great school.
You're smart.

54:16.199 --> 54:17.934
You have to be smart
to get into Northwestern.

54:17.968 --> 54:19.769
Plus a 3.8 GPA.

54:21.104 --> 54:25.208
And you're on a fast track in this
business, working here. You are.

54:25.242 --> 54:27.043
So, what's your plan?

54:28.912 --> 54:31.781
- Sorry?
- Where do you want to be in five to ten years?

54:31.815 --> 54:35.118
Oh. Uh, I want to produce.
I want to be a producer.

54:35.151 --> 54:36.953
- You do?
- Yeah.

54:36.987 --> 54:39.256
Okay, that's excellent.

54:39.289 --> 54:42.859
We could use more women producers.
It's a tough job.

54:44.595 --> 54:46.296
But I can see
that you've got what it takes.

54:48.965 --> 54:49.899
Thanks.

54:53.604 --> 54:56.840
So why are you in here trying to
throw it all away over this bullshit?

55:01.111 --> 55:02.312
- Sorry?
- This.

55:04.881 --> 55:05.982
Whatever it is.

55:07.418 --> 55:09.219
Let's make it official.
Call it a complaint.

55:09.252 --> 55:11.054
Let's assume I were to
do you the disservice

55:11.087 --> 55:12.889
of writing it up for you.

55:12.922 --> 55:15.158
So, your complaint
is as follows.

55:15.191 --> 55:18.194
The company hires
a new assistant.

55:18.228 --> 55:20.964
She's young and, in your
opinion, she's very pretty.

55:20.997 --> 55:23.401
- And she's maybe a little inexperienced.
- She's a waitress.

55:23.434 --> 55:26.836
Exactly. And they possibly
offered her a job just like that

55:26.870 --> 55:29.205
and they're putting her up
in a fancy hotel.

55:29.239 --> 55:30.974
And you live...
Where do you live?

55:33.009 --> 55:33.977
Astoria.

55:34.911 --> 55:35.945
Astoria?

55:38.014 --> 55:40.283
Okay. I understand.

55:40.317 --> 55:41.985
- That's not the point.
- And by the way,

55:42.018 --> 55:44.054
how experienced were you
when you got hired?

55:44.087 --> 55:46.424
Couple of internships?
Am I right?

55:46.457 --> 55:50.126
- The last one paid me.
- Do you know how many people work at this company?

55:50.160 --> 55:52.128
I have to make sure all
of them are taken care of.

55:52.162 --> 55:53.997
And do you know how many
people want to work here?

55:54.030 --> 55:58.335
I've got 400 r√©sum√©s teed up
for your position alone.

55:58.368 --> 56:02.005
Ivy League grads,
4.0 GPAs.

56:02.038 --> 56:04.307
And here you are sitting in my
office, stressed out,

56:04.341 --> 56:09.145
jealous of some new assistant who's
getting more attention than you.

56:09.179 --> 56:11.181
I'm not... I'm not jealous.

56:11.214 --> 56:14.317
I was just...
I was worried for this girl.

56:14.351 --> 56:17.320
She's a woman.
She's a grown woman.

56:17.354 --> 56:20.890
- Sorry, yes.
- You think a grown woman can't make her own choices?

56:20.924 --> 56:22.959
- I never said that.
- Because she's a waitress?

56:22.992 --> 56:25.396
- Nope, I didn't say that.
- What then? What then?

56:25.429 --> 56:26.930
Listen, honestly...

56:28.399 --> 56:30.300
what do you want from me?

56:36.072 --> 56:39.142
- I just...
- Tell me what you want me to do here.

56:42.345 --> 56:44.382
Do you want to
keep working here?

56:44.415 --> 56:46.015
I do. I...

56:54.124 --> 56:57.994
Look, frankly,
it's your call.

56:58.027 --> 57:00.230
I could file a complaint for
you if that's what you want.

57:01.499 --> 57:03.967
But I think you know
how it would come off.

57:12.142 --> 57:13.176
Should I file this?

57:24.422 --> 57:25.389
No, don't.

57:27.190 --> 57:28.291
Okay.

57:35.399 --> 57:36.500
Okay.

57:38.569 --> 57:39.969
Okay. Thank you.

57:42.038 --> 57:43.139
Don't forget your scarf.

57:44.340 --> 57:45.409
Thank you.

57:48.412 --> 57:51.181
I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

57:52.015 --> 57:52.982
Hmm?

57:55.118 --> 57:56.286
You're not his type.

59:15.198 --> 59:17.233
Yeah, that's an IT thing.
I don't know.

59:26.142 --> 59:27.611
You know you can always come to
us, right?

59:31.582 --> 59:33.049
Come to us first, okay?

59:48.131 --> 59:50.199
It's for you.

59:53.504 --> 59:55.071
You better get it.

59:59.410 --> 01:00:02.546
<i>I'm not gonna yell at you.
Am I yelling? No.</i>

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:05.416
<i>Because you're not someone
even worthy of that.</i>

01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:10.320
<i>Because you didn't even have the
fucking courtesy to talk to me</i>

01:00:10.353 --> 01:00:13.189
<i>about whatever the fuck fantasy
you decided to spew all over me.</i>

01:00:13.222 --> 01:00:16.560
<i>So, let me ask,
do you want to keep this job?</i>

01:00:19.396 --> 01:00:20.397
Yeah.

01:00:21.164 --> 01:00:22.131
<i>Okay.</i>

01:00:23.199 --> 01:00:26.169
<i>Then send me a fucking apology.</i>

01:01:14.551 --> 01:01:15.619
I overreacted.

01:01:18.689 --> 01:01:21.659
It was not my place
to question your decisions.

01:01:21.692 --> 01:01:23.192
Yeah, good.
That's good.

01:01:30.266 --> 01:01:32.636
I appreciate
the continued opportunity

01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:35.204
- to work with you...
- ...continued opportunity to work with you...

01:01:35.238 --> 01:01:36.573
...and will not
let you down again.

01:01:38.542 --> 01:01:39.543
...again.

01:04:18.702 --> 01:04:19.636
Hi.

01:04:22.172 --> 01:04:23.372
Hi.

01:04:27.878 --> 01:04:29.446
You, um...

01:04:29.479 --> 01:04:31.915
They, um, gave me this desk.

01:04:31.949 --> 01:04:33.617
They said
you'd teach me the phones.

01:04:41.558 --> 01:04:42.559
Okay, sure.

01:04:44.628 --> 01:04:45.996
Are you okay?

01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:47.764
I can't figure out
how to dial out.

01:04:48.999 --> 01:04:50.601
Oh. Nine-one to dial out.

01:05:01.645 --> 01:05:03.881
So, the extensions
are marked here.

01:05:03.914 --> 01:05:07.484
One is his cell.
Two is his home in the Village.

01:05:07.517 --> 01:05:10.721
Three is his home in Connecticut.
He's there most weekends.

01:05:10.754 --> 01:05:12.990
Four is Amagansett,
the Hamptons,

01:05:13.023 --> 01:05:15.192
but you'll only need that
for the summer.

01:05:15.225 --> 01:05:17.794
And then five is his wife.

01:05:18.862 --> 01:05:21.698
Six is his wife's assistant.

01:05:21.732 --> 01:05:24.868
Seven is Amir, his driver.

01:05:24.902 --> 01:05:26.904
And then
president of distribution,

01:05:26.937 --> 01:05:30.540
president of marketing
and president of production.

01:05:31.475 --> 01:05:32.542
Okay.

01:05:34.645 --> 01:05:37.681
And here is the LA office.

01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:40.717
And here's the London office.

01:06:02.706 --> 01:06:03.774
- Amir?
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:06:05.742 --> 01:06:07.844
- You're outside, right?
- <i>Yes. Out front. I'm waiting.</i>

01:06:08.779 --> 01:06:10.614
He's in a meeting.

01:06:10.647 --> 01:06:12.549
<i>The traffic is no good.
I told them that.</i>

01:06:12.582 --> 01:06:14.885
- <i>When will he be done?</i>
- I have no idea.

01:06:14.918 --> 01:06:17.020
<i>There's construction in the
tunnel so we need to hurry it up.</i>

01:06:17.054 --> 01:06:20.691
I don't... I don't care.
I don't care.

01:06:20.724 --> 01:06:23.493
Just... You're ready to go
when he is, right?

01:06:23.527 --> 01:06:24.861
<i>Yes. Of course.</i>

01:06:24.895 --> 01:06:26.663
Okay.
So that's all I need to know.

01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:43.513
Sorry. I didn't...
I didn't mean that.

01:06:43.547 --> 01:06:45.482
It's... It's been a long day.

01:06:48.685 --> 01:06:51.788
<i>You work hard.
He respects you for that.</i>

01:06:54.024 --> 01:06:55.993
- He said that?
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:06:56.026 --> 01:06:58.962
<i>He told me you're smart.
Very smart.</i>

01:07:04.034 --> 01:07:05.602
Thanks, but...

01:07:07.938 --> 01:07:09.573
But, uh... Thanks.

01:07:11.775 --> 01:07:12.909
<i>Okay, I'll be waiting.</i>

01:07:14.011 --> 01:07:14.978
Thank you.

01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:34.731
You can go if you want.

01:07:37.067 --> 01:07:39.636
Oh. Thanks.

01:07:51.148 --> 01:07:54.584
- I, uh... Should I leave these?
- Oh, yeah. You can just leave them.

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.089
- See you tomorrow?
- Yeah.

01:08:18.108 --> 01:08:19.142
Where to?

01:08:19.776 --> 01:08:20.877
Willy's?

01:08:20.911 --> 01:08:22.813
Dahlia's? I need to eat.

01:08:22.845 --> 01:08:24.714
- I need to drink.
- I hear that.

01:08:25.682 --> 01:08:26.750
Come through this way.

01:08:29.953 --> 01:08:31.921
I brought this along.

01:08:31.955 --> 01:08:33.857
Sure.

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:35.959
I just threw it together myself.
It's pretty lo-fi.

01:08:35.992 --> 01:08:37.160
Great.
Pack it for the trip.

01:08:39.129 --> 01:08:41.832
We currently have 30 projects
in development,

01:08:41.865 --> 01:08:43.667
some of which
will go in the next year.

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:45.202
Hi.

01:08:48.805 --> 01:08:50.740
- Did you get a car?
- Yep, downstairs.

01:08:51.707 --> 01:08:53.109
Hey. Dahlia's?

01:08:57.448 --> 01:08:59.149
I'm not
waiting around for that.

01:09:22.171 --> 01:09:24.908
- You've been to France?
- Uh, no, I haven't.

01:09:32.782 --> 01:09:33.783
Is this for LA?

01:09:34.751 --> 01:09:35.752
Yes.

01:09:41.057 --> 01:09:42.091
Who was that?

01:09:43.894 --> 01:09:44.928
Oh, that?

01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:47.930
A waste of my time.

01:10:55.566 --> 01:10:57.267
<i>Okay.</i>

01:10:59.869 --> 01:11:02.973
<i>That woman before
asked me what your name was.</i>

01:11:03.006 --> 01:11:04.908
<i>And I didn't know
what to tell her.</i>

01:11:05.576 --> 01:11:08.078
<i>I didn't know whether to say...</i>

01:11:09.413 --> 01:11:11.314
<i>"It's David."</i>

01:11:11.348 --> 01:11:14.050
<i>Whether to say your name like
that straightaway, because...</i>

01:11:16.119 --> 01:11:18.788
<i>I don't know. It might've seemed
like you were too familiar.</i>

01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:25.128
<i>And I didn't know
if she was asking</i>

01:11:25.161 --> 01:11:31.001
<i>in that way, or if she was
asking in that other way.</i>

01:11:31.034 --> 01:11:34.137
<i>The way that I imagine that
people whisper to one another</i>

01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:37.974
<i>when they see you
walking down a hallway,</i>

01:11:38.008 --> 01:11:40.143
<i>or checking your e-mail
at a traffic light.</i>

01:11:43.614 --> 01:11:46.349
<i>"Is that that professor?"</i>

01:11:52.289 --> 01:11:54.357
<i>Mm.</i>

01:11:56.394 --> 01:11:58.928
<i>What did you say?</i>

01:11:58.962 --> 01:12:00.997
<i>I told her I didn't know
what your name was.</i>

01:12:04.402 --> 01:12:06.303
<i>I told her
I didn't really know you.</i>

01:12:20.384 --> 01:12:21.985
That's for Los Angeles.

01:12:22.018 --> 01:12:23.153
Okay, sure.

01:12:24.921 --> 01:12:25.889
Schedule?

01:12:49.079 --> 01:12:52.949
You forgot the power cord
for the DVD player.

01:13:48.037 --> 01:13:50.206
- Yeah?
- <i>I don't need you. You can go...</i>

01:13:53.209 --> 01:13:54.177
I can go?

01:14:00.283 --> 01:14:01.485
Hello?

01:14:29.179 --> 01:14:30.280
Has he left yet?

01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:33.451
No.

01:16:06.877 --> 01:16:08.612
Don't worry.

01:16:08.646 --> 01:16:10.581
She'll get more out
of it than he will.

01:16:11.482 --> 01:16:12.583
Trust me.

01:16:18.656 --> 01:16:19.623
Good night.

01:16:20.457 --> 01:16:21.425
Good night.

01:18:34.391 --> 01:18:35.426
<i>Hello?</i>

01:18:35.459 --> 01:18:36.560
Happy birthday, Daddy.

01:18:36.593 --> 01:18:38.562
<i>Hey! Well, thank you.</i>

01:18:38.595 --> 01:18:42.298
<i>It was a good day.
Quiet, but good.</i>

01:18:42.331 --> 01:18:45.769
I'm... I'm so sorry
I didn't call you.

01:18:45.803 --> 01:18:49.006
I just... I've...
I... It's been busy.

01:18:49.039 --> 01:18:51.542
<i>Of course. I understand.</i>

01:18:51.575 --> 01:18:53.477
<i>It's a great opportunity
you have there.</i>

01:18:54.878 --> 01:18:56.345
<i>We're excited for you.</i>

01:18:57.481 --> 01:18:58.415
Thank you.

01:18:59.450 --> 01:19:01.785
<i>So, well, how's it going?</i>

01:19:03.554 --> 01:19:05.756
<i>Your mom and I
want to know everything.</i>

01:19:06.623 --> 01:19:08.324
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

01:19:08.357 --> 01:19:12.261
Um... It's okay. It's, uh...

01:19:12.295 --> 01:19:15.231
You know, it's just, like,
long hours and...

01:19:16.767 --> 01:19:19.536
- It's just stressful, you know?
- <i>Oh.</i>

01:19:19.570 --> 01:19:21.605
<i>It's always a little
stressful in the beginning.</i>

01:19:21.638 --> 01:19:23.607
<i>It gets easier.</i>

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.374
<i>You can handle it, honey,
I know you can.</i>

01:19:25.409 --> 01:19:27.377
Yeah.

01:19:27.411 --> 01:19:30.047
<i>Well, give us a call
on the weekend, okay?</i>

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.615
<i>We want to hear all about it.</i>

01:19:31.648 --> 01:19:34.685
- I promise I will.
- <i>Okay.</i>

01:19:34.718 --> 01:19:37.320
<i>Now it's getting late and
I've got to take this dog out.</i>

01:19:37.353 --> 01:19:39.857
- <i>But we'll be waiting for your call, okay?</i>
- Okay.

01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:41.759
<i>And get
a good night's sleep, okay?</i>

01:19:42.726 --> 01:19:45.062
- Okay.
- <i>Good night.</i>

01:19:45.095 --> 01:19:46.563
Bye. I'll talk to you later.
