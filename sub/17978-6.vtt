THE APPLICATIONS.

12:52.633 --> 12:53.733
YOU WHAT?

12:53.767 --> 12:55.067
WE DECIDED WE WERE
GOING TO APPLY

12:55.067 --> 12:56.200
TO FIRST PRES, WALDORF,

12:56.233 --> 12:57.567
THE CENTER FOR EARLY EDUCATION,

12:57.600 --> 12:58.967
THEN I ADDED CHADWICK
AND CHILDREN'S INSTITUTE

12:59.067 --> 13:00.833
BECAUSE THEY HAD EARLY ARTS
AND MUSIC PROGRAMS.

13:00.867 --> 13:01.933
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

13:20.967 --> 13:22.600
VERY CLOSE
TO MY HOUSE--

13:22.633 --> 13:23.833
THAT IS NOT A FACTOR.

13:23.867 --> 13:25.467
SO YOU'RE GOING TO
MAKE ANGELICA TAKE

A TWO-AND-A-HALF-HOUR CAR RIDE
EVERY SINGLE DAY

13:27.667 --> 13:30.167
