00:57.760 --> 01:00.843
In this corner, Roberto Durán.

01:07.360 --> 01:10.648
And in this corner, Benny Huertas.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.802
Ring sense is an art.

01:33.200 --> 01:38.611
A gift from God that flows out of a fighter
like a painting flows out of an artist.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.920
You're either blessed with it
from the day you're born...

02:01.920 --> 02:06.290
...or you're cursed
without it till you die.

02:11.880 --> 02:15.930
In 66 seconds,
Roberto Durán changed my life.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.128
This is his

02:39.240 --> 02:43.962
22nd knockout in 25 fights.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.923
You can make him a champ.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.930
I know it.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.441
Well, I don't think you need me, Carlos.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.971
I... the kid's got it all.

02:53.080 --> 02:55.560
But he's wild.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.330
Undisciplined.

02:57.440 --> 03:01.048
You know, he can't make this road towards
a world championship by himself.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.929
He grew up in the streets.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.530
Fought everything, everybody.

03:04.640 --> 03:07.605
Hates everything,
including the United States of America.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.688
Including the United States?

03:11.200 --> 03:14.886
His father was an American
who abandoned his mother.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.647
You can help him, Ray.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.802
Listen, I want to train the kid, I just...

03:21.920 --> 03:24.651
I-I don't want... you know...

03:24.760 --> 03:25.921
It's not easy.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.849
I don't want to stir things up.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.769
What, that thing with the wiseguys?

03:29.880 --> 03:31.245
That was 17 years ago.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.362
- Well, you think they still care?
- Yeah, yeah.

03:33.520 --> 03:36.251
I can pay you under the table.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.970
Ah, they know all the tricks.

03:38.080 --> 03:41.448
The only thing I can think of is...

03:41.560 --> 03:43.130
I'd have to train him for free.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.322
That's not a bad idea.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.481
Cholo.

03:50.600 --> 03:51.567
Hey.

03:51.880 --> 03:55.043
Thirty-one flavors and I got them all!

03:55.600 --> 03:59.364
I got somebody very, very important
that I want you to meet.

03:59.480 --> 04:04.202
The best trainer in the history of boxing.

04:05.560 --> 04:06.721
Ray Arcel.

04:06.840 --> 04:11.089
He has trained more world champs
than anyone else in boxing history.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.244
Relax. Don't look at me like that.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.044
Where are you?

04:15.160 --> 04:16.969
I told you I would bring you
to the Madison Square Garden.

04:17.079 --> 04:18.889
Have I ever said anything
that didn't happen?

04:19.000 --> 04:22.482
This man can make you world champ.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.011
I don't need nobody from America.

04:25.480 --> 04:26.481
I know.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.489
I got to go.

04:32.520 --> 04:33.885
Hey, Ray, Ray, Ray, Ray.

04:34.040 --> 04:37.124
It's good to see you,
Carlos, after all these years.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.368
We'll talk soon.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.050
Thanks, Ray.

04:41.160 --> 04:42.605
Okay.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.127
Hey.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.010
What's wrong with you guys?

04:49.720 --> 04:51.404
That's Ray Arcel

04:51.560 --> 04:54.564
Ray Arcel... 18 championships

04:54.680 --> 04:55.886
of the world.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.650
Plomo Quiñones...

04:57.760 --> 05:01.401
cero.

05:01.520 --> 05:05.366
Now you got two trainers.
You got Panama. Our Panama.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.209
And you got the man who knows...

05:07.320 --> 05:09.209
You really have balls, Eleta.

05:09.320 --> 05:12.688
I'm trying to make you world champ.
You don't wanna be world champ?

05:12.800 --> 05:14.165
You gonna eat all that shit?

05:14.280 --> 05:16.362
Of course! I bought it!

05:51.320 --> 05:54.606
Since 1903, the Canal Zone
was a U.S.-controlled territory

05:54.720 --> 05:56.051
right in the heart of Panama.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.969
And the rockets' red glare...

05:58.080 --> 06:01.289
By 1964, tension was at an all-time high

06:01.400 --> 06:04.370
as Panamanian students clashed
with the U.S. military over

06:04.480 --> 06:06.528
the right to fly their flag
in their own land.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.130
Viva Panama!

06:08.240 --> 06:11.005
Panama!

06:11.120 --> 06:13.043
Panama! Panama!

06:24.800 --> 06:26.211
USA! USA!

07:22.160 --> 07:23.889
Run! Run!

07:24.920 --> 07:26.410
Get out there and swim!

07:29.360 --> 07:30.407
Swim for your life!

08:01.720 --> 08:03.848
The conflict would last for three days,

08:04.000 --> 08:08.282
and when it was done, 22 Panamanians
and four U.S. citizens were dead.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.010
Mom, got food!

08:11.120 --> 08:14.090
Gun shots, Roberto, hide down here!

08:17.320 --> 08:20.722
What are you doing down there, you crazy?

08:21.720 --> 08:24.121
Mangoes!

08:32.400 --> 08:34.129
Wait!

08:34.280 --> 08:35.804
Did you steal that?

08:35.919 --> 08:39.241
Mom, you know me, I don't need to steal.

08:43.799 --> 08:46.041
Where did you find that?

08:46.160 --> 08:47.491
I got paid for my work.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.289
Thanks, son.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.880
Durán had several teachers in his life.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.162
One of the most important was Chaflan.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.486
He was like the Pied Piper
of the neighborhood

09:01.640 --> 09:03.165
who taught the kids how to survive.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.130
Mangoes for everyone!

09:13.160 --> 09:15.481
Now everyone say thanks for the mangoes.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.284
Thanks for the mangoes.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.687
If it's mine it's yours.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.371
And if it's ours it's yours.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.209
Thank you.

09:24.320 --> 09:27.767
Left, Left, Left, Right, Left.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.410
Numero dos!

09:29.520 --> 09:30.851
Numero tres!

09:30.960 --> 09:33.566
Numero cuatro!

09:33.680 --> 09:36.763
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!

09:37.080 --> 09:38.730
Run! We are late!

10:23.960 --> 10:29.603
Use your jab. Don't lower your guard.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.761
Sir.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.090
What's up, kid?

10:41.680 --> 10:42.966
Would you train me?

10:43.120 --> 10:45.327
Go to school. We are working here.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.124
You gonna pay for school?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.209
Just go, kid.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.206
All good.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.806
Shut up and box.

11:01.920 --> 11:06.369
Boxing is fighting,
all you do is dance like my sisters.

11:19.760 --> 11:20.568
Yeah!

11:20.680 --> 11:23.160
Stand up you coward!

11:27.160 --> 11:29.640
We are rich!

11:30.560 --> 11:32.324
I didn't know you liked to fight!

11:32.440 --> 11:34.920
You see? I'm gonna be world champ!

11:35.040 --> 11:37.202
Then you gotta take me to NY.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.641
Let's go eat!

11:42.480 --> 11:44.050
Hide the money!

11:45.240 --> 11:46.605
Give me that money, kid.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.200
Give me the money.

11:49.320 --> 11:50.685
I got no money.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.810
He's just a kid!

12:05.000 --> 12:07.367
- Wassup, kid?
- Wassup.

12:07.480 --> 12:09.209
- All good?
- Yes.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.371
Clearly, all is great.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.164
I can get you out.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.130
But let me be clear...

12:20.240 --> 12:22.720
If you are caught fighting or stealing...

12:24.720 --> 12:26.848
I'll bring you back myself
and leave you here.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.204
So you are gonna train me?

12:47.240 --> 12:48.969
They're not all gonna be this easy.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.645
Sometimes...

12:50.760 --> 12:53.366
You need to get points.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.491
There's technique...

12:57.600 --> 12:58.487
Rules.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.409
Cheats.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.481
Movement.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.804
You learning everything I tell you?

13:07.920 --> 13:09.251
I learn anything you want...

13:09.360 --> 13:12.204
as long as you get me an ice cream...

13:12.320 --> 13:14.527
every time I kill one of those fuckers.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.801
Stand up you coward!

14:01.680 --> 14:03.842
Hey.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.611
Baby.

14:06.720 --> 14:07.801
Turn around.

14:08.360 --> 14:09.885
Hey, psst.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.525
Blondie.

14:11.640 --> 14:12.880
What's your name?

14:16.600 --> 14:18.125
Did the mice eat your tongue?

14:20.400 --> 14:21.890
You're not going to give me your name?

14:22.120 --> 14:23.246
Huh?

14:23.360 --> 14:24.850
You speak English?

14:24.960 --> 14:26.121
You speak Spanish?

14:26.240 --> 14:27.605
Happiness

14:29.760 --> 14:34.209
You are kidding me, right?
Your name is happiness?

14:34.320 --> 14:37.847
Let me guess. It's what you've
been looking for all your life?

14:38.640 --> 14:40.449
The poor are born happy.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.928
Only the rich know sadness.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.806
And you still leave?

14:50.480 --> 14:51.527
Come here!

14:51.640 --> 14:53.688
Where are you taking me?

14:54.480 --> 14:56.050
It's okay, I don't bite.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.889
You are nuts.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.690
Marry me!

14:59.800 --> 15:01.040
I don't even know you!

15:01.160 --> 15:02.047
Exactly!

15:02.160 --> 15:04.686
We'll get the rest
of our lives to know each other.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.325
You are really crazy.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.805
Crazy for you.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.165
I can't change who I am.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.044
Then you need to forget about me.

15:13.160 --> 15:14.810
You're going to leave me here?

15:15.640 --> 15:17.244
You're the one who won't forget me!

15:18.160 --> 15:20.970
You'll be drawing hearts in your notebook.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.731
You are done, you turned...

15:24.280 --> 15:26.248
And you fell in love.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.529
You're crazy!

15:29.680 --> 15:32.286
What's up? What's that spaceship?

15:36.360 --> 15:38.169
Jeez. he's intense!

15:38.800 --> 15:41.610
This is Carlos Eleta,
the richest man in Panama.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.848
I've been looking for you for an hour!

15:44.000 --> 15:45.923
Stop screaming in front of everyone.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.844
I wanted to meet you.

15:49.960 --> 15:52.486
I hear you are unbeatable.

15:53.480 --> 15:56.927
When you fight clowns it's easy to win.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.931
You wanna be world champ? I can help you.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.082
Yes

16:03.200 --> 16:04.326
You speak English?

16:04.480 --> 16:05.925
He's looking.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.367
Yes, I speak English.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.528
Gonna take you to Madison Square Garden.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.130
Let's go right away.

16:13.720 --> 16:15.370
This is your plane?

16:15.480 --> 16:16.447
- Vamos, vamos, vamos.
- Robert, Robert, Robert,

16:16.560 --> 16:18.449
Robert, Robert, Robert.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.369
Don't look, don't look.

16:31.760 --> 16:36.648
In the early '50s, I wanted to
take boxing to every town in America,

16:36.760 --> 16:40.726
but the New York City wiseguys
were not happy about that.

16:40.840 --> 16:44.286
Boxing is a New York City sport,
and that it's gonna remain.

16:44.440 --> 16:48.444
But this national television tour of yours
is taking the spotlight off of the Garden.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.564
And that we can't afford.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.648
Well, I...

16:53.760 --> 16:56.240
I think it'll help you
in the long run... Frank.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.409
If you can trust what I'm saying.

16:59.520 --> 17:03.445
TV will turn boxing
into a nationwide pastime

17:03.560 --> 17:04.800
and you'll have talent and fans

17:04.960 --> 17:07.531
from every part of the country coming
to see championships at the Garden.

17:07.640 --> 17:10.119
I don't give a shit about
every part of the country.

17:10.240 --> 17:11.605
New York is the heart of the cow.

17:11.720 --> 17:15.843
It's the prime meat. If any boxing fan wants
to see a fight in the flesh or in front

17:15.960 --> 17:18.361
of your little dirty tube,
better understand

17:18.480 --> 17:21.926
that all roads go through New York.

17:37.760 --> 17:41.490
When they heard I survived,
we made a deal.

17:41.600 --> 17:45.922
They would spare my life as long as I
never made another dollar from boxing.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.968
It's a familiar smell.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.367
Where were you?

17:54.480 --> 17:55.925
What, what are you talking about?

17:56.040 --> 17:57.166
Did you go there?

17:57.280 --> 17:58.520
Where?

17:58.680 --> 18:01.047
That's what I said... where?

18:01.160 --> 18:04.724
Please, you make it sound like
I've been with some woman or something.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.241
I would rather you were with some woman.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.328
Don't always be a district attorney.

18:09.480 --> 18:10.925
I was seeing an old friend.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.007
You know, it's fine.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.326
I'm blonde.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.680
I look great in black.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.768
I will be a very hot widow.

18:16.880 --> 18:17.881
Is that what you want?

18:19.400 --> 18:21.721
How many years do I have left?

18:23.400 --> 18:24.640
Ray.

18:24.760 --> 18:27.491
These people will kill you.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.489
Yeah, well.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.648
I might as well be dead already anyway.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.001
Oh, what a lovely thing
to say to your wife.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.600
I don't mean... you, honey. I mean...

18:39.120 --> 18:41.248
we are what we do.

18:41.360 --> 18:45.410
And if you just make money,
you become money.

18:45.560 --> 18:48.609
This thing that everybody wants

18:48.720 --> 18:51.326
that everybody craves, it's just symbolic.

18:51.480 --> 18:52.766
It has no real value.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.962
I have to do something
that I really care about.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.526
I'm not an idiot.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.085
I know you're miserable.

18:59.240 --> 19:03.325
I get it, but those animals
run everything.

19:04.640 --> 19:07.291
I'd rather live in fear.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.242
Pick it up a little, pick it up.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.045
You're gonna have to learn to breathe.

19:30.160 --> 19:34.165
And you're gonna learn to pace yourself.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.442
There's technique and there's strategy.

19:36.560 --> 19:39.769
Technique is your every move,
your every punch

19:39.880 --> 19:41.962
covers all your short-term decisions.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.401
Strategy is your plan for the whole fight.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.806
It's your long term.

19:45.920 --> 19:50.682
It defines how you apply the technique
to achieve your major goal.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.485
It's okay if your technique
fails for a beat

19:53.600 --> 19:56.331
as long as you're following the strategy.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.529
Buchanan knows you're gonna try
to knock him out in the first round.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.529
And then he'll wait for you
to get tired and try

20:01.640 --> 20:05.008
and catch you, and that's his strategy.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.087
¿Comprende?

20:06.200 --> 20:07.326
He expect...

20:07.440 --> 20:09.363
but if you slow down

20:09.480 --> 20:11.369
and go...

20:11.520 --> 20:15.081
slow, slow, slow, slow,
slow, slow, slow...

20:17.280 --> 20:19.408
Buchanan no comprende.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.366
Get off the fence.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.641
Excuse me?

20:23.760 --> 20:24.647
Get off the fence.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.091
Ah, shut up, schmuck.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.526
Who do you think you are, old man?

20:27.640 --> 20:29.085
I'm Ray Arcel from Harlem, USA.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.281
You know where that is?

20:30.400 --> 20:33.246
And this is the future world champion
you're talking to here.

20:33.360 --> 20:36.091
Fuck off.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.601
He's in a jail and he thinks
he's in charge.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.848
- We in jail.
- No, he-he's in jail.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.361
- They put jail here.
- No, no, he...

20:43.480 --> 20:45.801
He's... It's all in the head.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.730
Boxing is a mental sport, aquí.

20:48.840 --> 20:51.525
What you do with your body
is one-third of the job.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.246
You got to learn to be
the boss, which you are.

20:54.360 --> 20:55.850
Say it, "He's in jail."

20:55.960 --> 20:57.530
Say it. "He's in jail."

20:59.000 --> 21:01.367
- He's in jail.
- He's in jail.

21:01.480 --> 21:02.402
See? In jail.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.726
I thought I told you to fuck off.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.490
You in jail.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.408
You don't know when to stop, do you?

21:06.520 --> 21:08.329
You in jail.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.283
- Okay, okay.
- You, you in jail.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.880
Get the fuck out of here.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.690
- Is that the way you want this to go?
- You in jail.

21:14.800 --> 21:15.847
You are in jail.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.480
I'm champion. This is Panama.

21:18.600 --> 21:19.726
Nice.

21:19.880 --> 21:20.881
Hook after the right. Hook.

21:21.640 --> 21:22.641
Double up. Jab. Jab.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.723
That's it, that's it, there you go.

21:24.840 --> 21:25.727
There you go.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.448
That's it. That's it!

21:30.600 --> 21:32.728
Nice, nice.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.607
Ciao.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.010
Hey, you are the boxer.

22:06.360 --> 22:07.327
Yes.

22:07.440 --> 22:08.851
And you are?

22:09.560 --> 22:10.971
I heard you won.

22:11.720 --> 22:13.563
Yeah, that was easy.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.648
Now I'm going for the world championship.

22:16.920 --> 22:17.807
That's good.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.490
Can I walk with you?

22:19.600 --> 22:21.807
What school did you go to?

22:23.600 --> 22:27.400
I went to the Plomo Quiñones school.

22:28.400 --> 22:31.290
Now I'm in the Ray Arcel.

22:32.720 --> 22:33.323
Ray Arcel?

22:33.440 --> 22:34.566
Uh-huh.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.648
American school?

22:36.760 --> 22:40.207
Yes, American school.

22:40.320 --> 22:42.607
You didn't go to school, did you?

22:45.680 --> 22:48.650
But you can read, right?

22:48.800 --> 22:51.371
This is like a job interview.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.767
I thought I was walking you home.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.885
Yes.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.128
I can continue alone.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.924
Why?

23:17.160 --> 23:19.527
We come from different worlds.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.923
It's all in the head.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.888
What?

23:37.960 --> 23:39.246
It's all in the head.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.568
Turn the right hand over,
turn the right hand over.

23:53.680 --> 23:57.328
The first thing a future world champ
needs to be taught is to be lucky.

23:57.440 --> 23:59.807
And luck is a woman
you must learn to seduce.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.606
Be the host of the ring.

24:04.720 --> 24:07.371
This is your temple,
and everyone does as you wish.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.607
Be the master of time.

24:10.760 --> 24:13.843
You and only you
should decide when to strike.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.443
Come see.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.328
This is the kitchen.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.528
Aquí.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.162
My heavy bag.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.325
Some perfumes.

24:53.440 --> 24:54.521
Come see.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.130
I'm looking at it.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.803
You don't like it?

25:20.200 --> 25:22.806
I'm just used to...

26:28.880 --> 26:30.086
Hey, Ray.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.371
How you doing, huh?

26:40.800 --> 26:43.041
No worries.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.361
You look good.

26:44.480 --> 26:46.289
How's the wife?

26:46.400 --> 26:48.801
She's good, thanks.

26:50.200 --> 26:54.931
20 years since your heroic mission
to expand boxing to the nation.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.088
Boxing expanded. I wasn't wrong.

26:57.200 --> 27:02.164
Yes and no. But yes, the sport
makes for fantastic television.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.282
And now you're back.

27:05.480 --> 27:06.641
Sort of.

27:06.760 --> 27:08.125
I like you, Ray.

27:08.240 --> 27:11.244
I feel really bad
for what they did to you.

27:11.360 --> 27:14.566
I don't need to look a gift horse up
the ass to know there's shit in there.

27:14.680 --> 27:15.806
I thought we had a deal.

27:15.920 --> 27:17.445
We do.

27:17.560 --> 27:20.201
Maybe I'm confused about
what kind of deal we're talking about.

27:20.320 --> 27:23.046
You weren't meant to make money
from boxing again.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.406
I'm training him for free.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.522
You can check with Carlos Eleta.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.051
He's the fighter's manager.

27:28.160 --> 27:31.683
You're a classy guy, but you're not
going to teach me how to hide money.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.564
Buchanan's favored 14 to three
against Durán, right?

27:33.680 --> 27:34.806
That's right.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.246
Except Durán's going to win.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.442
Put all your money on Durán.

27:38.560 --> 27:41.291
Make a bundle.

27:41.400 --> 27:46.046
Leave me alone if he wins,
shoot me if he loses.

27:47.680 --> 27:50.047
You're a classy guy.

27:51.240 --> 27:55.404
Mr. Arcel, why come back from
retirement with an unproven fighter?

27:55.520 --> 27:57.329
I just turned 73.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.408
You know, seven decades and change.

28:00.440 --> 28:03.446
And myself and Freddy Brown here
have probably forgotten more

28:03.560 --> 28:05.324
than most trainers will ever learn.

28:05.440 --> 28:09.283
But I remember well,
from the '20s to the '50s

28:09.400 --> 28:11.607
we lived the golden age of boxing.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.449
Then television took over

28:13.560 --> 28:18.361
and we all became... ambitious.

28:18.480 --> 28:22.004
The sport turned into a spectacle,
show business with blood.

28:22.120 --> 28:26.325
And it was a good thing, because we reached
audiences nobody thought we could reach.

28:26.440 --> 28:30.283
The problem, inevitably,
is that the fighters started doing it

28:30.400 --> 28:34.371
for the fame, for greed,
for self-importance.

28:34.520 --> 28:37.205
Independent promoters
faded away and, with them,

28:37.360 --> 28:40.045
the true hungry fighters,
the lifeblood of this game.

28:40.160 --> 28:43.164
Tonight, however, you'll meet
the best lightweight

28:43.320 --> 28:45.049
New York has seen in 50 years.

28:45.200 --> 28:48.124
A true, true hungry fighter.

28:48.240 --> 28:49.366
Like in the old days.

28:49.480 --> 28:54.086
He's got the soul, the rage, the mental
energy and determination the sport needs,

28:54.200 --> 28:55.565
and that's why I'm here.

28:55.680 --> 28:58.526
Because a new golden era for boxing
begins with Roberto Durán.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.410
With 28 wins,
zero losses and 24 knockouts...

29:10.560 --> 29:13.962
from the slums of El Chorrillo, Panama...

29:14.080 --> 29:17.402
...Roberto Durán.

29:17.520 --> 29:21.927
The lightweight champion
of the world, Ken Buchanan.

29:25.880 --> 29:27.245
He's got a skirt?

29:28.080 --> 29:29.764
He is wearing a skirt, Roberto!

29:29.880 --> 29:31.370
A fuckin' skirt!

29:37.160 --> 29:38.286
Take him to the movies.

29:38.400 --> 29:39.686
Charm him. Let him open up.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.962
Then go to work on him.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.525
Remember what we worked on. Strategy.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.445
Excuse me.

29:53.920 --> 29:55.843
Are they fighting yet?

29:55.960 --> 30:01.000
It's about to start.

30:05.880 --> 30:11.011
Durán is certainly trying to improve
on his nine one-round knockouts here.

30:11.160 --> 30:12.844
He's throwing everything.

30:16.560 --> 30:18.005
Johnny scores it as a knockdown.

30:25.080 --> 30:26.923
Find that body!

30:27.040 --> 30:29.327
The challenger is a little over-anxious.

30:29.440 --> 30:30.965
It was almost Buchanan
scoring the knockdown.

30:32.720 --> 30:34.484
Kill him, cholo!

30:36.320 --> 30:38.004
Durán may punch himself out.

30:38.120 --> 30:39.326
Don't rush in. You got him.
Just keep on him.

30:39.480 --> 30:41.801
Remember the strategy.
He wants you to get tired.

30:41.920 --> 30:42.921
I don't care about the strategy.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.121
- I'll kill him.
- Listen to me.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.924
If you don't go in with a feint and a jab,

30:46.040 --> 30:47.769
he's going to nail you
on the way in. He's tall.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.609
He's-he's too tall for you.

30:49.720 --> 30:51.609
Strategy. Stick with the strategy.

30:51.720 --> 30:53.563
- Fuck off.
- No, don't tell me that.

30:53.680 --> 30:55.125
Don't say those things to me.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.810
Fuck off. Yeah, yeah, he's tall
and he's gonna nail me.

30:56.920 --> 30:58.331
What, you work for him or what?

30:58.440 --> 31:00.010
- Are you out of your mind?
- Yeah, he's taller than me...

31:00.120 --> 31:01.565
What am I doing here? I don't need this.

31:01.680 --> 31:02.727
Yeah, because he's gringo.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.325
- Listen, you stupid little schmuck.
- Right?

31:04.440 --> 31:05.601
You want me to leave here?

31:05.720 --> 31:07.051
I can leave you in the corner by yourself.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.730
Now behave yourself, act like a grown-up,

31:08.840 --> 31:10.763
- and stop being a baby.
- I'm fucking with you.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.120
- I'm nervous, okay?
- I know you are, I know you're nervous,

31:12.240 --> 31:13.969
- but look at him.
- Don't make me worse, okay?

31:14.080 --> 31:15.730
I'm... You're making yourself worse.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.808
- Okay, relax now.
- You're mak... no, you relax.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.127
You get out there and
you show me what you can do.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.321
You pace yourself.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.606
You be the boss.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.124
Keep the pressure on him behind the jabs.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.810
Start working on the body.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.645
Keep the pressure on...
that's... keep the pressure on him.

31:36.200 --> 31:38.362
What's going on?

31:42.640 --> 31:44.927
Durán's going for that knockout.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.042
That's a white bitch, Cholo!

31:48.080 --> 31:50.242
Eso una perra blanca, Cholo!

31:54.640 --> 31:55.766
Oh!

31:55.880 --> 31:57.450
He really hurt him that time.

31:59.040 --> 32:00.804
Buchanan's in trouble...

32:00.920 --> 32:02.888
Make him shit his pants!

32:07.320 --> 32:09.209
Buchanan's mouthpiece goes out!

32:10.920 --> 32:13.844
Remember, Buchanan came
from a broken home.

32:15.480 --> 32:18.563
Get him up against the ropes!

32:58.520 --> 32:59.851
Cholo!

32:59.960 --> 33:01.644
Johnny. Johnny.

33:01.760 --> 33:03.000
That was a clean shot.

33:03.120 --> 33:04.565
You gotta know that.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.728
We're in New York City,
don't forget, don't forget.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.728
- I didn't hit him in the, in the balls.
- No, no.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.882
- I hit him in the gut.
- No, believe me, I know.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.241
Durán! Durán!

33:21.200 --> 33:22.645
He's good.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.683
- He's good.
- I can hear you.

33:24.800 --> 33:25.961
I can hear you, I'm okay.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.491
- I'm okay.
- He's good.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.644
Hey!

33:41.640 --> 33:45.440
Durán, Durán, Durán, Durán, Durán!

33:45.560 --> 33:46.971
Hey!

33:47.080 --> 33:48.127
We love you, Panama!

33:48.240 --> 33:50.322
Durán, Durán, Durán...

33:50.440 --> 33:56.209
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh...

34:01.040 --> 34:03.088
Hey, Ray! Cheers.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.521
- I got a question for you.
- Yeah.

34:05.640 --> 34:10.201
Why you always brushed my hair
when we were in the corners?

34:10.320 --> 34:13.165
Fighter punches you, feels proud.

34:13.320 --> 34:16.686
Bell sounds, next round starts,
you come out looking all fresh,

34:16.800 --> 34:18.245
like you just came out of the shower.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.203
Drives him nuts.
He thinks he can't hurt you.

34:20.320 --> 34:21.650
All psychological.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.206
Oh...

34:24.320 --> 34:26.163
- Strategy.
- Strategy.

34:26.280 --> 34:27.725
- Aha.
- Strategy.

34:27.840 --> 34:29.364
Aha, you schmuck.

34:29.480 --> 34:30.606
- Huh?
- Now you're speaking Yiddish.

34:30.719 --> 34:32.005
- Yeah.
- Yes.

34:32.120 --> 34:33.246
"Schmlendeck."

34:33.360 --> 34:35.408
Schmendrick. Putz.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.728
Yeah, son of a putz.

34:38.639 --> 34:40.688
- Hey, watch my hair gel.
- No, no, I just...

34:40.800 --> 34:42.040
I just...

34:42.159 --> 34:43.127
Yeah.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.082
Open my belly!

35:33.640 --> 35:34.641
Don't open her belly!

35:34.760 --> 35:35.966
Empuja.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.644
How do we call him?

35:38.760 --> 35:40.568
Roberto Duran.

35:44.920 --> 35:45.887
It's a girl!

35:48.400 --> 35:49.561
Another girl

35:53.040 --> 35:54.121
Roberto Durán.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.282
You can't name them all Roberto.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.289
Let's name him Robin, then, like Robin Hood.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.129
We fight the rich to give the poor.

36:01.840 --> 36:06.004
Another boy and his name is Roberto Durán.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.884
And I don't wanna hear it.

36:23.360 --> 36:27.888
How are the girls? Did you eat?

36:28.000 --> 36:28.922
Yes!

36:29.080 --> 36:31.811
Get some sodas.

36:36.080 --> 36:37.570
What's wrong?

36:37.680 --> 36:39.364
Papi, we've given away 100 grand already.

36:39.480 --> 36:40.845
What's the problem?

36:40.960 --> 36:43.406
We got money. And it's good to give.

36:43.520 --> 36:46.171
Look how happy everyone is.

36:49.560 --> 36:52.086
Thanks for the food, Durán.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.408
Jump! Jump!

37:04.920 --> 37:06.684
We are here to participate in

37:06.800 --> 37:11.090
the signing of treaties which will assure
a peaceful and prosperous...

37:11.200 --> 37:15.246
...of the United States
to the belief that fairness

37:15.360 --> 37:16.725
and not force

37:16.840 --> 37:19.967
should lie at the heart of our dealings
with the nations of the world.

37:20.360 --> 37:23.045
Dear Mr. President Carter.

37:23.160 --> 37:26.448
In the name of the truth of logic,
I would like to say,

37:26.560 --> 37:29.086
that we will sign this treaty.

37:29.200 --> 37:33.888
He's signing the treaty!

37:34.000 --> 37:38.688
The treaty is signed! The Canal is ours!

37:38.800 --> 37:42.122
Blondie!

37:42.280 --> 37:45.170
They're gonna give us the canal!

37:45.320 --> 37:48.051
General Torrijos signed the treaty!

37:48.200 --> 37:51.568
See to believe the word of a Yankee.

37:53.080 --> 37:54.366
Come see what I got you.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.131
But wait... this is important.

37:57.240 --> 38:00.449
- Torrijos is good with the people.
- You wanna see the real Panama canal?

38:00.560 --> 38:04.451
I've seen that tiny canal a million times.

38:04.560 --> 38:07.928
You say that because
all you have is a sail boat.

38:08.040 --> 38:12.728
A sail boat? I got the Titanic here.

38:12.840 --> 38:14.649
Sink it then.

38:14.760 --> 38:19.329
All Panama is celebrating in the streets
and you are not even happy?

38:19.480 --> 38:21.960
Happy about what?

38:22.080 --> 38:23.650
About what?

38:23.760 --> 38:27.162
You've obviously never
been chased by a Marine.

38:27.320 --> 38:28.685
Excuse me?

38:28.800 --> 38:30.768
Rich girl.

38:30.880 --> 38:31.722
Get off of me.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.604
Now you gonna get mad?

38:33.720 --> 38:36.087
Yes. You're talking shit.

38:36.200 --> 38:37.565
Eh?

38:38.120 --> 38:41.602
They offer to return
your own territory in 1999.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.165
In twenty years!

38:44.240 --> 38:47.164
For fuck's sake, it's ours!

38:47.280 --> 38:49.089
And it has nothing to do
with being rich or poor.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.282
It's common sense.

38:53.440 --> 38:57.286
Now this is fucked.
I'm celebrating and you are pissed.

38:59.280 --> 39:02.523
If you wanna make your people proud,

39:02.640 --> 39:05.928
this is the guy to beat.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.283
What does it say?

39:12.000 --> 39:13.968
When are you gonna learn to read?

39:14.120 --> 39:15.121
What does it say?

39:15.240 --> 39:17.208
It says "Fighter of the year".

39:17.320 --> 39:19.721
Fighter of the year? This clown?

39:19.840 --> 39:22.969
He hasn't fought a man in his life.

39:23.080 --> 39:25.367
He is the symbol of American sports.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.130
My balls.

39:33.200 --> 39:35.089
He's the symbol of American Sports.

39:37.680 --> 39:41.048
If you want your Torrijos-Carter treaty...

39:41.160 --> 39:43.845
to mean anything for this country...

39:43.960 --> 39:47.009
before 1999...

39:49.480 --> 39:53.644
destroy their idol
and make them respect Panama.

39:53.760 --> 39:56.764
That idol goes down in one round.

39:57.360 --> 39:58.566
Let me see it.

39:58.680 --> 40:01.445
For you I got 15 rounds or more.

40:26.800 --> 40:27.926
Wow.

40:28.040 --> 40:29.166
He's lightning fast, this guy.

40:29.320 --> 40:31.846
He's imitating Ali.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.450
Punches like a girl.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.050
Yeah, but he could run
away from you all night

40:35.200 --> 40:37.202
and score dozens of points
with these punches.

40:37.320 --> 40:38.446
He's jumping all over
the place. Look at him.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.886
I mean, it's like, uh,
he's a different kind of animal.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.201
You gotta work on your speed.

40:42.320 --> 40:45.410
Man, if you love him so much,
why don't you go train him?

40:45.520 --> 40:47.568
I don't love him, I respect him.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.489
And you should do yourself
a favor and respect him, too.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.489
- Look at him.
- No, but go, Ray,

40:51.600 --> 40:52.965
go and massage the shoulders
you love so much.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.923
- Oh, come on, stop it, come on.
- Huh? So now am I slow?

40:55.040 --> 40:56.690
- I don't know, whatever, stop it.
- Now am I slow?

40:56.800 --> 40:58.450
- No, go and massage his shoulders.
- I... you're...

40:58.600 --> 41:00.648
- Go with your gringo, Ray.
- Oh...

41:01.960 --> 41:03.644
Maybe you've been training him already.

41:03.760 --> 41:05.285
I don't know where you go at night.

41:05.440 --> 41:07.841
You, you've gotta be kidding me. Roberto!

41:07.960 --> 41:09.962
- Huh? No?
- Come on, stop it. Shut up. Grow up.

41:10.080 --> 41:11.445
Not everything revolves around you.

41:11.560 --> 41:13.961
I have responsibilities.
Come on, look at this...

41:14.080 --> 41:16.048
They must know that-that-that
I won't be able to beat...

41:16.200 --> 41:17.326
to-to-to-to beat him.

41:17.440 --> 41:18.771
I will beat him, you know?

41:18.880 --> 41:20.370
I will beat him because I'm a good boxer.

41:20.480 --> 41:21.720
- And you know what?
- Strategize right now and sit down.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.330
I will make him fight like a man.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.010
- Sit down so we can discuss everything.
- I'm done looking.

41:25.120 --> 41:26.007
No go.

41:26.120 --> 41:27.929
I will beat him. With my strategy.

41:28.040 --> 41:30.168
If you leave,
I'm packing my bags. I'm going.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.645
- Leave.
- You leave, I'll leave.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.165
- Be my guest.
- Ah...

41:35.120 --> 41:36.406
Goddamn schmendrick.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.841
Goddamn you, fucking schmendrick.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.089
And you tell your father, root for me, okay?

41:46.440 --> 41:47.805
Too cute.

41:49.360 --> 41:51.488
Isn't that Durán?

41:51.600 --> 41:54.570
Uh... yeah.

41:54.680 --> 41:56.728
You know he was here?

41:56.840 --> 41:59.525
Manos de Piedra!

41:59.640 --> 42:01.608
Look at the rich kid.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.529
He's a real fighter?

42:03.640 --> 42:05.085
- Or a clown?
- Hey.

42:05.760 --> 42:06.841
Respect, Durán. He's with his wife.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.490
What, this son of a bitch here?

42:08.600 --> 42:10.648
- Or are you talking about the whore?
- Hey, hey.

42:10.760 --> 42:12.000
Hey, hey, you show some respect, man.

42:12.120 --> 42:13.406
You talking to me, you piece of shit?

42:13.520 --> 42:14.851
You know what you are?

42:14.960 --> 42:16.086
Take that machismo bullshit out of here.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.850
All I see is a golden spoon child

42:17.960 --> 42:19.086
who thinks he can fight a man.
You can fight a man?

42:19.200 --> 42:20.406
- Hey, shut up.
- You can fight a man?

42:20.520 --> 42:21.885
Let's get out of here, Ray.

42:22.000 --> 42:22.887
- Come on.
- You're a pussy, man.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.241
You're a clown. All you do
is dance and jump around.

42:25.360 --> 42:26.964
Jump around and sell soda.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.730
He's gonna whip your ass.

42:28.840 --> 42:30.410
- You shut up, too, bitch.
- Oh, fuck you!

42:30.520 --> 42:34.130
I'm gonna fuck your husband in the ring
and when I'm done with him, I'm gonna go

42:34.280 --> 42:35.406
- and fuck you all night, baby.
- Oh, you...!

42:35.520 --> 42:36.851
Gonna fuck them here, huh?

42:36.960 --> 42:38.610
What is wrong with you?

42:42.480 --> 42:43.720
You wash your mouth
before you talk to a woman!

42:43.840 --> 42:45.524
Right now, right now, motherfucker.

42:51.440 --> 42:54.728
I come all the way, all the way
from Panama to fight a man.

42:54.880 --> 42:57.611
And all they give me is a pretty boy.
What the fuck?

42:59.760 --> 43:02.926
And you see, and you see his,
um, his diet cola commercial?

43:03.040 --> 43:05.361
And he calls himself "Sugar"

43:05.480 --> 43:07.608
and he's selling you sugar-free shit.

43:10.920 --> 43:14.891
Or-or maybe, maybe that's what
we're gonna have.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.128
A sugar-free fight.

43:25.760 --> 43:27.250
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah!

43:27.360 --> 43:28.566
I'm sorry, okay?

43:28.680 --> 43:30.205
Sorry's not good enough.

43:31.800 --> 43:34.007
How could you do that?
Insult a woman like that?

43:35.640 --> 43:38.086
What's the matter with you?

43:38.200 --> 43:40.362
Well, my country felt insulted by yours.

43:40.480 --> 43:42.050
And not only women.

43:42.160 --> 43:44.766
Children.

43:44.880 --> 43:47.481
What does your country have to do
with the way you talked to that woman?

43:47.640 --> 43:49.085
The way you behaved?

43:49.200 --> 43:52.727
You know how... you know how
it is to be hungry?

43:52.840 --> 43:54.763
And I don't say, "hungry" hungry.

43:54.880 --> 43:57.008
To be hungry that you have to go to...

43:57.120 --> 43:58.610
to-to the garbage for food?

43:58.720 --> 44:00.085
While the American army
is exploiting your country?

44:00.240 --> 44:01.651
You know how it feels?

44:01.760 --> 44:04.969
What does that have to do
with what you just did?

44:05.120 --> 44:06.724
What are you... what are you doing?

44:06.840 --> 44:08.968
- Well, it has to do...
- You know, you want to be,

44:09.120 --> 44:10.884
you want to be, you want to be a warrior,

44:11.040 --> 44:13.168
you want to avenge your people,
fine by me.

44:13.280 --> 44:15.009
Avenge your people. Be a warrior.

44:15.120 --> 44:18.010
But real warriors do not do what you did.

44:18.120 --> 44:20.691
They don't mess with women
the way you just did.

44:20.840 --> 44:24.922
And if you want me in your corner,
you cannot do that again.

44:32.840 --> 44:34.763
Well, well, okay,
okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44:34.880 --> 44:37.406
But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry to him.

44:37.520 --> 44:41.287
I say I'm sorry to you,
but I'm not gonna say I'm sorry to him.

44:41.400 --> 44:43.084
Let's forget it.

44:43.240 --> 44:44.685
What's done is done.

44:46.960 --> 44:48.564
Are you mad?

44:48.680 --> 44:50.842
And let's just...

44:50.960 --> 44:52.564
focus on the fight.

44:54.200 --> 44:56.248
This anger you feel, I understand that.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.966
You don't want to become
a victim of your own mind game.

44:59.080 --> 45:01.401
It's all in the head.

45:12.640 --> 45:13.846
Robert.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.689
Why are you here?

45:19.160 --> 45:19.683
Huh?

45:19.800 --> 45:22.485
If Ray finds out you are dead.

45:22.600 --> 45:23.681
I can't sleep.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.964
What's wrong?

45:29.000 --> 45:31.321
I don't want to disappoint tomorrow.

45:31.440 --> 45:32.885
Dad!

45:33.040 --> 45:34.246
Hey!

45:34.600 --> 45:37.206
My babies! Good morning!

45:37.320 --> 45:40.403
Kisses for Daddy.

45:40.520 --> 45:42.807
Can't wait to see you kill that coward!

45:42.920 --> 45:44.251
Don't say that!

45:44.360 --> 45:47.011
But Dad said it on TV.

45:47.120 --> 45:49.964
It's my job to say those things.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.082
So you're not gonna kill him?

45:52.200 --> 45:54.885
Of course,
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.129
It's all a show.
He says that so the fight is more fun.

45:58.240 --> 45:59.287
Come get dressed.

46:08.680 --> 46:10.045
Durán has turned
into the audience favorite

46:10.200 --> 46:11.486
after a menacing training process in town.

46:11.600 --> 46:14.126
He has been so aggressive.

46:14.240 --> 46:19.087
The referee tonight is Carlos
Padilla, who gloriously oversaw

46:19.200 --> 46:22.682
the Thrilla in Manila
between Frazier and Ali.

46:22.840 --> 46:24.171
You have to let them fight,
otherwise you're gonna see

46:24.280 --> 46:25.406
two guys running all night.

46:25.520 --> 46:27.568
To your corner. To your corner.

46:27.720 --> 46:29.722
Biggest ring I ever saw.

46:29.840 --> 46:32.764
Sugar Ray Leonard!

46:32.880 --> 46:36.363
- The crowd is booing the champ...
- Booing?

46:36.520 --> 46:38.443
...in what must be startling for Leonard,

46:38.560 --> 46:42.005
who, in this very stadium surprised
the planet by winning Olympic gold.

46:42.120 --> 46:43.485
It's a wonderful day.

46:46.560 --> 46:48.881
That's okay, baby!

46:49.000 --> 46:50.809
It's your night tonight!

46:55.320 --> 46:58.005
You're dead meat, Durán!

46:58.120 --> 46:59.087
- That's right.
- You're nothing.

46:59.200 --> 47:00.690
Fuckin' Cholo!

47:00.800 --> 47:01.767
Yeah.

47:04.160 --> 47:05.924
Keep him close to your body.
Don't chase the lady.

47:06.040 --> 47:07.280
Let her come to you. Don't let her run.

47:07.400 --> 47:09.129
Rather lose than run.

47:09.240 --> 47:10.446
Look at him.

47:10.560 --> 47:12.688
...15 rounds of boxing...

47:15.000 --> 47:16.684
Strategy.

47:18.480 --> 47:21.051
Presented by the promoter...

47:27.160 --> 47:31.361
This Canadian crowd has embraced
the underdog Roberto Durán.

47:31.480 --> 47:33.130
Speculation has been rampant

47:33.240 --> 47:35.811
over whether Leonard will turn
this into a street fight

47:35.920 --> 47:40.202
or go back to the boxing
which brought him here.

47:40.320 --> 47:42.607
Leonard and Durán!

47:47.680 --> 47:50.968
Durán getting inside the jab of Leonard.

47:55.080 --> 47:57.287
At him! Keep him on the ropes! At him!

47:57.400 --> 48:00.802
Two fighters at the top of their game.

48:02.760 --> 48:04.569
Jab! Jab! Jab!

48:04.680 --> 48:06.250
Stay on him! Stay on him!

48:06.400 --> 48:07.481
Get out of there, get out of there!

48:11.320 --> 48:12.560
- Break it up.
- That's not Leonard.

48:12.680 --> 48:15.286
Leonard is short punches, not wide ones.

48:15.400 --> 48:16.162
Break it up.

48:18.080 --> 48:21.891
The normally elusive Leonard
is staying flat-footed.

48:22.040 --> 48:25.489
He wants to trade with Durán
and not back down.

48:25.600 --> 48:27.329
He wants to prove he's a man.

48:27.440 --> 48:29.169
Let him feel he's resisting.

48:29.280 --> 48:31.851
Keep him hoping until he's
inspired and then kill him.

48:31.960 --> 48:33.291
Look at me!

48:33.400 --> 48:34.925
Who the fuck are you today? Huh?

48:36.480 --> 48:37.891
This is honor I'm fighting for.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.331
Fuck that shit!

48:43.320 --> 48:45.049
Make him fight.

48:45.160 --> 48:46.082
Go get him, champ!

48:46.200 --> 48:47.247
Run him around!

48:50.840 --> 48:53.286
Durán! Durán! Durán!

48:53.400 --> 48:54.561
Durán! Durán!

49:06.920 --> 49:10.289
Durán lands a left hook
to the neck that wobbles Leonard!

49:10.400 --> 49:11.970
Ankles! Ankles!

49:13.640 --> 49:14.926
Dale Chucha tu Madre!

49:15.040 --> 49:18.610
This is not the Leonard
we're used to seeing.

49:18.720 --> 49:22.284
Can you believe he's trying
to match macho with macho?

49:22.400 --> 49:23.731
Durán pushes back.

49:23.840 --> 49:25.524
Leonard has some room now.

49:25.640 --> 49:26.971
Good right hand by Leonard.

49:27.080 --> 49:29.811
Break. Open. Open.

49:35.880 --> 49:38.201
The key to Leonard is his left jab.

49:38.320 --> 49:40.448
But it's also working in tandem
with those legs.

49:40.560 --> 49:45.569
Right now, seems like he's flat-footed,
just trying to tee off on Durán.

49:45.680 --> 49:47.330
Go! Beat him!

50:01.480 --> 50:04.165
Now, Sugar Ray is fighting
an inspired fight.

50:13.360 --> 50:14.930
You gotta try to knock him out, Cholo.

50:15.040 --> 50:16.246
You never know with these darn judges.

50:16.360 --> 50:18.601
They can take the fight away from us.

50:18.720 --> 50:20.848
This has been your best fight.

50:20.960 --> 50:22.803
But you're still human.

50:22.920 --> 50:24.285
You could still lose.

50:26.600 --> 50:27.840
I want you to focus.

50:31.240 --> 50:33.083
Are we gonna be champions?

50:34.560 --> 50:37.450
Tu eres mi campeón.

50:51.240 --> 50:52.571
Against the ropes.

50:53.840 --> 50:55.888
Last round, champ!

50:56.000 --> 50:57.331
Now or never!

50:57.440 --> 50:58.407
Round 15!

50:58.520 --> 51:00.363
Not many thought it would come to this.

51:00.480 --> 51:01.970
The crowd is on their feet.

51:02.120 --> 51:04.248
And at the battle here in Montreal.

51:04.360 --> 51:07.728
- We are in the waning moments of this fight.
- Go, go!

51:07.840 --> 51:10.047
I cannot believe what I'm seeing.

51:10.160 --> 51:12.891
I cannot believe what is taking place.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.960
To the very end,
these two warriors going at it.

51:17.080 --> 51:20.243
Like they don't know
that a bell is going to ring.

51:20.360 --> 51:23.443
This is what we are here for.

51:23.600 --> 51:25.125
We are witnessing history.

51:25.240 --> 51:26.924
Cholo, knock him out!

51:27.040 --> 51:28.804
Who wants it more?

51:28.920 --> 51:30.001
Let's go, Cholo!

51:34.000 --> 51:35.525
An amazing battle!

51:35.640 --> 51:38.166
And we're in the 15th round.

51:40.120 --> 51:42.043
This fight is gonna go all the way!

51:42.200 --> 51:43.361
We are counting down.

51:43.480 --> 51:47.209
Six, five, four, three...

51:47.320 --> 51:49.687
And the bell is going to ring!

51:49.800 --> 51:51.564
Here they are!

51:51.680 --> 51:53.045
Look at these two warriors!

52:01.760 --> 52:03.000
Behave, behave, behave!

52:03.120 --> 52:04.565
- We could get penalized, behave.
- You shit!

52:04.720 --> 52:07.963
We've seen this before,
when a fight is close.

52:08.080 --> 52:10.686
The decision usually goes to the champion.

52:10.800 --> 52:13.201
Who's the cunt now?
Who's the cunt now, motherfucker?

52:13.320 --> 52:15.163
- Maricón!
- Fuck you!

52:15.280 --> 52:17.487
You are my bitch!

52:17.600 --> 52:20.410
Robbie!

52:25.880 --> 52:26.961
You won, my love!

52:27.120 --> 52:30.806
Three judges score the fight as follows:

52:30.920 --> 52:32.763
Judge Angelo Poletti

52:32.880 --> 52:37.727
calls the match 147 to 147.

52:37.880 --> 52:39.644
It is a draw.

52:46.720 --> 52:48.006
Be calm, my love.

52:48.120 --> 52:49.770
Judge Harry Gibbs calls the match

52:50.640 --> 52:53.644
- 145 to 144.
- You've proven yourself.

52:53.760 --> 52:55.046
for Roberto Durán.

53:03.880 --> 53:07.327
Attention. Attention.

53:07.440 --> 53:09.602
Judge Raymond Baldeyrou

53:09.720 --> 53:14.044
calls the match 146 to 144.

53:16.920 --> 53:18.684
- The new welterweight...
- Yeah!

53:18.840 --> 53:21.684
...champion of the world, Roberto Durán!

53:59.120 --> 54:00.610
Hello.

54:00.720 --> 54:02.370
I'm calling from the Coney Island Hospital

54:02.480 --> 54:04.608
in regards to a patient
with a heroin overdose.

54:04.760 --> 54:06.967
- Yes?
- Patient's records

54:07.080 --> 54:10.163
indicate she's the daughter of Ray Arcel.

54:10.280 --> 54:13.523
No, th-this is the wife of Ray Arcel,

54:13.640 --> 54:16.166
and my husband does not have a daughter.

54:16.280 --> 54:17.805
You must have the wrong number.

54:17.920 --> 54:20.002
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Nope, no worries. Good night.

54:20.120 --> 54:21.963
What happened?

54:22.080 --> 54:24.162
Nothing. It was just a wrong number.

54:24.320 --> 54:25.731
What'd they say?

54:25.840 --> 54:28.764
They said there's another guy
named Ray Arcel

54:28.880 --> 54:30.450
and his daughter is in the hospital.

54:30.560 --> 54:32.130
What hospital? What-what happened?

54:32.240 --> 54:35.530
I don't know, but I know I'm not gonna
be able to go back to sleep now.

54:35.640 --> 54:37.244
What are you doing?

54:38.800 --> 54:40.370
Aw, Jesus.

54:43.880 --> 54:45.086
Thank you.

54:52.680 --> 54:54.284
I understand
you're related to the patient.

54:54.400 --> 54:57.370
Yes, I'm her father and, uh,

54:57.520 --> 54:59.329
I'll, uh, be responsible
for anything that...

55:00.960 --> 55:02.564
Why are you here?

55:07.360 --> 55:08.725
All these years... you come now?

55:08.840 --> 55:10.330
Why?

55:10.440 --> 55:12.442
You have no fighters to-to nurture?

55:18.520 --> 55:20.488
What are you doing here?

55:24.680 --> 55:26.648
I don't want to be seen like this.

55:31.600 --> 55:33.011
I'm not one of your fighters.

55:33.120 --> 55:35.600
Hazel and I couldn't have kids.

55:35.720 --> 55:38.326
And we... wanted to adopt.

55:38.480 --> 55:42.251
We adopted Adele and when Adele
was four, Hazel passed away.

55:42.400 --> 55:44.607
I didn't know what to do. I had no money.

55:44.720 --> 55:48.042
I couldn't take care of her. I...

55:48.160 --> 55:50.970
I-I thought she'd be better off
with my in-laws. I...

55:55.200 --> 55:57.043
I was, uh...

55:57.160 --> 55:59.561
- I know I should have told you, I was...
- Told me?

55:59.680 --> 56:02.126
What about her?

56:02.240 --> 56:06.806
What about the girl hanging on to
her life by a thread in a hospital bed?

56:20.280 --> 56:22.089
Sure. Leonard.

56:22.200 --> 56:23.850
You are my friend now.

56:30.320 --> 56:32.243
Baby, I want to show...
I want to show you something.

56:32.360 --> 56:33.566
Yeah?

56:35.520 --> 56:37.170
What do you want to show me?

56:39.360 --> 56:41.362
- Uh...
- Want to go in there?

56:41.480 --> 56:43.050
Yeah, we will.

56:43.160 --> 56:46.130
But I-I want to show you
something before we do, okay?

56:46.240 --> 56:47.765
Just... just let me...

56:47.920 --> 56:49.126
let me...

56:51.080 --> 56:54.289
...have respect for Sugar Ray Leonard?

56:54.400 --> 56:56.767
Sure.

56:56.880 --> 56:59.724
Sure. Leonard.

56:59.840 --> 57:02.081
You are my friend now.

57:06.720 --> 57:08.085
Look at this.

57:08.200 --> 57:09.964
Leonard.

57:10.080 --> 57:12.128
You are my friend now.

57:12.280 --> 57:16.410
All along, he's been
doing this on purpose.

57:16.520 --> 57:18.648
He hurt you to drive me crazy.

57:18.760 --> 57:21.286
To get me to be

57:21.400 --> 57:23.528
in his macho tough guy war.

57:23.640 --> 57:25.085
Ray, you're obsessed.

57:25.200 --> 57:26.804
I'm telling you, it's a strategy.

57:26.960 --> 57:28.200
It's been a strategy...

57:28.320 --> 57:30.004
I'm gonna fuck your husband in the ring

57:30.120 --> 57:32.970
and when I'm done with him,
I'm gonna go and fuck you all night, baby.

57:33.080 --> 57:37.082
From the moment he insulted you,
he knew that he could get in my head

57:37.200 --> 57:41.046
and cause me to stand toe-to-toe with him.

57:41.160 --> 57:42.446
I've never lost.

57:42.600 --> 57:45.251
I don't lose.

57:46.200 --> 57:47.440
Angelo.

57:47.560 --> 57:49.722
Talk to Don King.

57:49.840 --> 57:53.208
Durán should fight no one but me.

57:53.360 --> 57:55.567
Set the rematch immediately.

57:55.680 --> 57:58.001
Tell you what I'm gonna do, Carlos.

57:58.160 --> 58:01.650
I'm gonna add a two to that eight
and bring it up to ten.

58:01.760 --> 58:03.569
$10 million, Carlos.

58:03.680 --> 58:06.047
You're gonna have the highest
paid fighter in history.

58:06.160 --> 58:08.401
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, boy.

58:08.520 --> 58:11.330
I know you like the sound of that, Carlos.

58:11.440 --> 58:13.010
I know you like the sound of that.

58:27.040 --> 58:28.166
Eva.

58:28.280 --> 58:29.884
Hey, Cholo.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.126
Cholo.

58:31.240 --> 58:32.446
I'm exhausted.

58:32.560 --> 58:33.163
Hey.

58:33.320 --> 58:35.322
I've been calling you for a week.

58:35.440 --> 58:37.920
What's up, Eleta?

58:38.040 --> 58:41.442
- I have great news, Cholo.
- ¿Que pasó?

58:41.560 --> 58:43.164
They want a rematch.

58:43.280 --> 58:44.645
Who?

58:44.760 --> 58:47.001
What do you mean who? Leonard!

58:47.120 --> 58:50.010
Leonard? What is he a masochist?

58:50.120 --> 58:52.407
I got you the most money ever

58:52.520 --> 58:54.090
- for a welterweight.
- How much? How much?

58:54.200 --> 58:56.202
$8 million.

58:58.840 --> 59:00.046
Hey, Boba.

59:00.160 --> 59:02.242
$8 million for a rematch with me.

59:02.360 --> 59:02.849
He must be desperate.

59:02.960 --> 59:05.611
No, the... no, the man needs the money.

59:07.160 --> 59:08.321
- Cholo. Cholo.
- What?

59:08.480 --> 59:09.606
Look at me.

59:12.400 --> 59:13.083
Pay attention.

59:13.200 --> 59:14.690
Okay, okay.

59:14.800 --> 59:16.529
I have to respond to these people tonight.

59:16.640 --> 59:20.328
In front of witnesses, do you accept
a rematch with-with Leonard?

59:22.040 --> 59:25.688
I'd fight him, but I'm not
gonna fucking marry a guy.

59:25.800 --> 59:27.564
You're drinking. You're getting fat.

59:27.680 --> 59:30.331
You come to my house and you call me fat?

59:30.440 --> 59:31.726
You have mirrors in your house?

59:31.840 --> 59:33.444
You're the one who's getting fat.

59:33.560 --> 59:36.251
You're getting fat from all
the food that you're eating

59:36.360 --> 59:38.442
because of the money
that I'm making for you.

59:38.560 --> 59:40.210
So what the fuck?

59:40.320 --> 59:42.243
Parasite.

59:44.160 --> 59:46.970
That's what you are,
you're a fucking parasite.

59:47.080 --> 59:49.970
You call me fat, I call you parasite.

59:50.080 --> 59:51.445
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, Eleta.

59:52.240 --> 59:53.571
Now you are mad?

59:55.040 --> 59:57.964
Hey!

59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.289
What the hell are you doing?

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.448
Can't you see you got us all wet?

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.642
You are a fuckin' parasite too!

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:09.731
I'm telling you to get out you idiot!

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.490
Rob, what are you doing?

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.489
He got me soaked.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.204
Get out I said!

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.403
This is my fuckin' house, you moron.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.889
Get out or I'll get in and break you.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.650
It's Chaflan, Rob!

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:29.846
Stop it, it's Chaflan.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.044
Chivo, where's the Cholo?

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.611
Cholo!

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:18.608
That's the man, talk to him.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.331
How are you?

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.966
I saw you on TV.

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:39.926
I was in town and, uh...

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.601
said to myself, "Why not?"

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.364
Hey, listen. Uh...

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.882
I'm not proud of what I did.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.241
But look:

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.966
you're the world champ.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.526
She was 14.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.449
No money.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:01:59.925
Your son.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.730
I was in the army.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.805
And, uh, when they say you gotta leave,

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.490
there's no ifs or buts.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.806
What do you want?

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.370
Nothing.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.165
Just, uh, just thought I'd say hi.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.805
Hi.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.646
I thought you were American.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.889
I am American.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.330
You look Mexican to me.

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:36.205
Well, Mexican heritage.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.800
You thought I was, uh, blond,

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.331
- blue eyes, eh?
- Yes.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.169
I can't take back what I did.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.324
All I can say is, uh,

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.885
I'm sorry.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.286
And I'm...

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:56.562
I'm proud that you're my son.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.241
Ladies and gentlemen,
I bring you this show from Las Vegas.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:14.208
Don't miss this international show
for all Panamanians.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:21.130
Let's play a game.
Everyone look at the ball...

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.407
Hold it right there!

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.409
I'm hungry, man.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.760
Catch him!

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.169
A bit salty...

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.248
but thank you.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.008
Revolting!

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:45.646
Fuck you!

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:48.327
While you were at your party...

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.728
What?

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.849
Chaflan was killed.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.767
Who told you?

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.727
You can't discipline him by
forcing him to do something.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.645
You have to let him live
his life in a certain way.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.921
Stunned!

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.280
I was stunned!

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:15.205
And he will be stunned
when he hears what you did.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:16.970
And I have to explain it to him.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.605
Yeah, explain to him
that I got him $8 million,

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.449
- which is the most money...
- He doesn't care.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.523
- ...that anyone has ever made.
- But he doesn't even know that.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.290
He doesn't know that even for himself.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:27.046
That the money is
the least important thing.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:29.891
He's a professional fighter.
He can lose that weight.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.490
Three months to lose almost 40 pounds.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.761
You know what that does to a fighter?

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.291
I want what's best for him.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.682
- I want us to do what is best for him.
- That's not best for him.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.087
That's best for you but not for him.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.167
Well, that's your opinion.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.725
Let me tell you this...

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.205
That's not my opinion. That's a fact.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.084
If he doesn't take this fight,
you know what's

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.964
going to end up happening? He's
going to go fight some nobody.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.844
He's going to lose and he
will never, in a million years,

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.008
get close to making the money
he's making right now.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:58.169
He's Durán. He can't lose.

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:01.363
He's Durán. When he is focused,
he doesn't lose to a nobody.

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:02.641
You know that.

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.046
He won.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.764
Let him enjoy it. Let him party.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.006
So what if he's partying?

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.406
So what if he's eating?

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:09.885
Let him eat. Let him have a good time.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.764
He never had anything.
He never ate anything.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.882
And now he's finally earned something.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.490
He's earned it himself.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.967
Nobody gave it to him.
And you just take it away.

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.242
I've been dealing with that
animal for the last ten years.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.249
He's a, he's a, he's a, he's a good kid...

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.885
He needs to be disciplined!

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.361
He will be disciplined! That's my job.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:30.371
If he loses, then we can sign
another rematch and...

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.721
You're a sick paskudnyak
wanting your fighter to lose.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:34.291
No, what I said was, "if"...

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.526
- Carlos, you have the money.
- Ray.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:36.971
- Family has the money.
- Ray.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.570
He didn't have it. He doesn't care.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.290
The most important thing
for him is to win.

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.482
The most important thing for me is to win.

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.608
To have the respect of winning.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.881
Right. What I said was,
if he loses, he can have a rematch...

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.570
I'm done.

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.681
I met my father.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.882
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.804
What was he like?

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.002
He's Mexican.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.485
I thought you said he was American.

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.726
Um, he's American.

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.370
I mean, he was born in America.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:16.370
And I thought that he would
look like Paul Newman.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.562
But he looks more like Pancho Villa.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.563
Think you look like Paul Newman?

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.291
No, but Charles Bronson, maybe.

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:28.924
There's someone else you're going
to have to learn to forgive.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.849
Carlos.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.406
Why?

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:35.010
He agreed to the rematch.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.645
For when?

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.001
- Three months from now.
- Well, that's impossible.

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.600
We have to make it possible.
He already signed.

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:43.131
He can't sign without my permission.

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.730
He said you gave him your permission.

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.888
At your house, at a party.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.565
In front of a lot of people.

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:49.886
Witnesses, he said.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.484
Hi!

01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.886
Hi. They're insured.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.810
So you can destroy them if you want.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:05.366
No matter what,
you're going to do the fight.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.881
- You want me to call the police?
- Yeah, call the police!

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.048
They put me in jail and you
lose... you lose your fucking

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.003
$8 million!

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.122
Well, now, Cholo,
now you understand it's a business.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.685
- I'm not a hooker!
- A hooker is cheaper

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.689
and it doesn't create this much problems.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.131
You should be training right now.

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:22.044
I've been training all my fucking life!

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.282
Go home, Roberto.

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:27.563
If you lose the fight,
we can have a rematch.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.365
I don't lose!

01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:32.608
In Panama, a nationalist demonstration...

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.121
We got 75 days to lose 35 pounds.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:36.844
You've got to keep working, Cholo.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:39.406
I don't want to do this,
man, I want to rest.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.487
- You want to rest?
- I'm tired, man.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.886
- You want to rest?
- Yes.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.127
To rest is to rust. And you know that.

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.526
You're the kind of fighter
that's gotta stay on your toes

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.166
and if you don't stay on your toes,
then you're gone, that's it.

01:08:48.279 --> 01:08:49.725
And you can do this.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.729
But you're going to have
to decide to do this.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.251
Nobody can do it for you.

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:54.885
There's no such thing as a reluctant hero.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.240
You're going to have to do it on your own.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:58.767
I work all my life, man.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.370
I work all my life.

01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:02.050
I didn't have any food when I was a kid.

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:05.209
I'm hungry, man, I'm hungry.

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:07.049
I don't want to be hungry anymore.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.247
I want to enjoy what I have, Ray.

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:11.647
The rioting that followed was unexpected.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:15.609
The Zone police used tear gas and fire
hoses to drive off the demonstrators.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.290
I understand that.

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:21.404
I can try to convince Don King
to delay the fight.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.126
But we got to be ready to fight
in case you have to.

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.924
Okay.

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:29.245
You still mad?

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:31.362
Don't know what to tell you.

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:34.361
Forgive me?

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.130
Okay.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.370
I need you.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.524
I don't want to fight.

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.846
Focus on your training.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:49.281
Why don't you come with the kids?

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:51.805
I wanna see you.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:56.482
You need to rest, Robert. Go to sleep.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:57.965
Love you.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.284
I love you.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.088
Me too.

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.806
Do you realize I'm black?

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:14.691
Do you realize that I am
the only black promoter

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:16.689
in the business and that if you pull out,

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.280
- they will fry me?
- We're not pulling out.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.805
He can't make the weight.

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.729
It's impossible for him
to make the weight.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.366
We got CBS. We got the stadium.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.767
We got the sponsors. We got the tickets.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.405
You can't go to them and ask them?

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.170
Yeah, I can go to them and ask them.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:34.363
I'll say, "Excuse me, Mr. CBS,
I need another month."

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.484
They'll say, "Black nigger, no."

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.931
That's what's going to happen.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:44.045
Your boy either has to make his weight
or he will be disqualified, period.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.844
Yeah, but you're making it about yourself.

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.371
You're making it about Bob Arum.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:48.606
You're saying that "I'm gonna look bad.

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.330
I'm the only black promoter."

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.522
With all due respect,
that doesn't mean anything.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.523
You have a responsibility to boxing.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.051
Boxing?

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:59.004
Boxing has been run
by gangsters and criminals

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.566
and scoundrels since the day it was born.

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.365
Come on, now. Don't you put this on me.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.130
- Don't you dare put this on me.
- It's a sloppy production

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:09.329
to start so soon when he's not ready.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:14.082
I happen to think that Roberto Durán,
the man with the hands of stone,

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.328
if you challenge him, he will be ready.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:20.001
He has got the spirit
of Panama in his heart.

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.406
You don't have to tell me what he has.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.646
I know him better than anybody here.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.921
All right, I'm sorry.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.565
If we continue down this road, Ray,

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:27.967
I'm gonna have to sue you
for breach of contract.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:31.004
This is some mess you got us into.

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:43.248
Oh. Gosh, Ray, you scared me.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.526
What are you doing here?

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.846
How did you even get in?

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.761
Hey. What...

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.211
Hey...

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.051
Ray, we can't do this.

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.243
Babe, baby, okay, come on.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.203
Ray, look, it's against the rules.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.446
The fight's just around the corner.

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:01.686
Come on, come on, babe.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.086
No, no, no, no, no.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.884
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.002
It's my rules this time.

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.326
Okay?

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.003
You want to beat Durán,

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.248
you're going to have to humiliate him.

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:39.849
You're going to have to shame him,
right there, in front of everyone.

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.851
It's not going to work.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.883
Sorry.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.048
Sorry, you have to defend the title.

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.686
Or what they'll do is
they'll just take it away.

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.201
- What?
- They will take away the belt.

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.685
But I won the fight.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.689
Everybody saw it.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.609
They can just take away my belt?

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:22.041
They-they... that's what they can do.

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:25.642
They will take it away
if you don't defend it.

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.923
Roberto Durán had brought us
a new golden era for boxing.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.850
Yet here we were, reminding him
that he didn't matter.

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:38.088
That decisions were made in the back room

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.806
and he was only a circus animal
we needed for ticket sales.

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.046
Approved.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.529
You're going to see blood in this fight.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.529
I don't like clowns.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:56.682
When you come into the ring,
you come to fight, not to dance or to clown.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.450
He's imitating Ali all the time,
that's what he does.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.686
He doesn't have any style.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:02.924
I'm going to knock you out,
'cause imitators are losers.

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.605
And I don't like you.

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:10.284
Well, I think Durán is a lovable guy.

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.368
And I want my son to be just like him.

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:16.129
Listen.

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.605
I think Durán is a tough,

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.481
impressive, intelligent fighter.

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:25.406
And we are in for a serious fight.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:41.967
You're gonna feel bad.

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.406
Stop it.

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:45.488
- Hand me that.
- You can't eat like this.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.284
Pass me that yellow thing.

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.966
Why didn't I get wings when I asked?

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.002
You have plenty.

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.010
And why were you looking at Leonard?

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.281
Don't start with that.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.845
You think I didn't see you?

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:02.247
Don't fool me.

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:04.761
- You think I'm stupid?
- Insane is what you are.

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.929
I saw him winking at you.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.168
And you were all smiles.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.561
The former champion of the world,

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.490
Sugar Ray Leonard!

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.843
...will be the rematch of the century.

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:30.285
Here comes Leonard with his
entourage led by Angelo Dundee.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:35.004
And here he is, the challenger
tonight, Sugar Ray Leonard.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.043
Looks very composed.

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.889
He looks very relaxed.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.411
...world!

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:43.763
Roberto...

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:45.848
Durán!

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.167
The man with the hands of stone,

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:51.170
from Panama, has to be regarded

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:54.966
as one of the greatest
fighters of all time.

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:59.080
And now Ray Charles, in honor of whom

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:03.165
Sugar Ray Charles Leonard was baptized,

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:06.523
will sing "America the Beautiful."

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:11.685
O beautiful

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:16.727
For purple mountain...

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.202
America

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.689
Sweet America

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:27.804
He done shed His grace

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.410
And you oughta love Him for it

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:32.450
'Cause He...

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:34.050
From sea to...

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:36.686
Get out there and swim!

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:44.207
Shining sea...

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.561
Thank you, Ray.

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.170
Kick his ass, son.

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.248
- Oh, I will.
- Do it for me.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.404
The action begins.

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.727
Leonard fighting for pride tonight,

01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:00.327
while Durán defends his place
in immortality.

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.208
Durán! Durán! Durán!

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.368
Durán! Durán!

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.845
There's Leonard.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.167
That's what he wants to do in this fight.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:15.404
He says he did not work his jab
efficiently in the first fight.

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.646
Stop following him!

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:17.886
Go after him!

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.446
Get him! Get him! After him!

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.085
We have 20 seconds left in the round.

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.446
Suffocate him.

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.608
Up against the ropes! No mercy!

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:27.131
Up against the ropes!

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.208
Cut him off. Get him up against the ropes.

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.606
Against the ropes!

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.121
This is a much more confident Leonard

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:36.323
we are seeing here tonight.

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.763
You gotta be the host.
You're acting like a guest.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:44.967
You gotta pressure him,
you gotta put him on the ropes.

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:46.445
You gotta bang to the body.

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.722
It's your house.
Nobody else's. It's your house.

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:50.251
- You understand that, Cholo?
- I don't feel good.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.691
You're letting this guy run all over you.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.687
He's running in circles around you.

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:55.361
- You know that he does, that's his defense.
- I don't feel good.

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.487
You don't feel good? You ate too much.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.648
Focus. Don't let this guy run on you.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.650
Don't let him run, don't let him run on you.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.650
- Durán is falling more and more, on his part...
- Keep him there, keep him there!

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:06.524
...into the pattern of the first fight.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.247
- Durán got in a good shot.
- Yeah!

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.442
- This is what Durán can do.
- That's it, that's it, Cholo.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.451
Hey!

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:19.121
Durán is struggling to contain Leonard.

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.642
You can see his anger and frustration.

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.006
Cut him off!

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:28.404
Leonard is a moving target.

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.682
- And Durán is going...
- You get him!

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:34.209
Get control of yourself.
Look at me! Look at me!

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.287
- Box, motherfucker!
- Listen.

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:37.004
- You gotta box him.
- Don't.

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.326
- You're letting him do that.
- I'm very fucking pissed.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:44.169
Durán cannot get him up against
the ropes like he did in the first fight.

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:45.481
Have you seen the size of the ring?

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.487
They built the ring on purpose
so he can escape from me.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.486
The sneer is off his face.

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.284
Yes! Yes, Ray!

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.528
No, no, I'm a boxer.
I'm not a fucking ballerina...

01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.483
I don't come here to dance with a man.

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.610
And he's got Durán. Openly.

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.166
Not just furious but puzzled.

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.760
Durán troubled by the movement.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:17.080
Dundee would be well advised,
I think, to tell Leonard to stop that.

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:19.282
Leonard flaunting his skills.

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:23.206
- And it is a vastly different human being...
- Stop following him around!

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.283
...that Durán is tonight.

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.684
That's right, baby!

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.484
Yeah!

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.841
Work on the body and then up to the head.

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.166
- Everybody is laughing at me.
- No.

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:36.647
Get out of your head.

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.682
- I'm not a fucking clown in the, on the ring.
- Get, get out of your...

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:47.571
And he caught him with the left!

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:48.841
Yes.

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.363
Calm down.

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:54.527
- You're let...
- I'm chasing the motherfucker.

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:55.966
You're let... L-Look at me.

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:57.320
You don't need to do that, all right?

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.322
You're about to be welterweight
champion of the world.

01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:00.527
Get out of your head!

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.766
You're not doing what you should be doing.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.882
You know how to do it, get out there.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.922
I want to be proud of you. I want you
to get out there and I want you to...

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:07.883
Look at me! You're Roberto Durán.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.286
Get in there and act like him.

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:13.089
Go to the body! Cut him off!

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:56.280
Hey.

01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:00.241
Cholo, what are you doing?

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:02.886
What are you doing?

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:11.728
He... he quit!

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:15.447
Durán quit! He said, "no más."

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.688
No, no, no, no, no, no. Cholo.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.768
Roberto Durán has quit.

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:23.806
What are you doing?
You're going... you can't.

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:25.126
The heck are you doing?

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:27.049
- You got to fight him.
- No. Fuck him.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:30.004
- You've gotta fight him!
- No, no, he's a loser...

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.849
You can't. You've got to...

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.371
- Are you... What are you doing, Cholo?
- I'm not going to fight.

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:36.051
I didn't come here to fight a clown.

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.804
- You gotta go fight.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:39.081
They fuck me over.

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.326
- I've had enough.
- No, no!

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.851
I'm not a clown.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.365
Listen, you have to go in there and fight.

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:44.970
You can't do this.

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.570
- Why are you doing this?
- It's fucking bullshit.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.330
Roberto. Roberto, what happened?

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:50.283
I'm retiring from boxing.

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:53.006
He, he said he's retiring from boxing.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.287
Suddenly, inexplicably,

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.562
the fight has ended.

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:05.048
Don't do it, Robbie!

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.650
Fight!

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.205
You have to fight!

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.247
Bullshit.

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.600
This is for America.

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.362
We did it! We did it!

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.448
Go.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:01.209
I don't care how much ability
you've got as a fighter.

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:08.644
If you can't think, you're
just another bum in the park.

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:10.967
Boxing is brain over brawn.

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:44.323
Thousands of people in the Super Dome

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:47.450
and millions more in the closed
circuit theaters across the country

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:50.725
have been cheated out of a fight
that they paid to see.

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:54.650
The commission and the public
deserve an explanation.

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:01.365
When a fighter loses a fight in the ring,
it oftentimes is the fighter's fault.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:03.847
But when a fighter
loses a fight in his head,

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:06.008
it always is the trainer's fault.

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:07.201
The cameras. The flashes.

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:09.243
The microphones.

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:13.331
The... hero worshipers.

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.922
Television can make anyone
think of himself as a god.

01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:20.281
And I...

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.801
I probably failed at, uh,

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:25.287
keeping my fighter grounded.

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:31.081
But I can tell you this:

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:33.771
Roberto Durán is no coward.

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.526
He did not leave the ring
out of fear of an opponent.

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.166
He left it out of pride.

01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:41.851
There is talk of suspending Durán.

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:43.325
What would you say about that?

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.044
I-I don't know what happened.

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.764
And if I don't, then you don't.

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.370
But what I do know is

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:51.729
how Roberto Durán began in life.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:55.447
I know what he willed himself to become.

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.767
I know the honor
he has brought this business,

01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.769
which sometimes doesn't deserve it.

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:03.290
And I know you cannot suspend him.

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:04.925
He deserves better.

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:08.809
And if you don't understand that
and you do this to him,

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:11.969
you will wake up tomorrow
and you will feel ashamed.

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.805
Faster, faster!

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.089
Get in there kids!

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.891
What's wrong with you?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.721
Fuck you all!

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.440
We have no more right or reason

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:08.969
for giving away the Panama Canal Zone
than we would to now give away Alaska.

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:12.050
And I think that our
foreign policy should be one

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:15.530
and we, the people who own the Canal,
should say to our government,

01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:19.247
look, tell Mr. Torrijos
that we built that thing.

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:21.243
We bought the place. We paid for it.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:24.131
And we intend to keep it from here on out.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.411
Come up here.

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:44.840
Get up.

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:47.847
Come.

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:55.768
Let's get out of here.

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:57.450
This is not life.

01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.881
It's real life.

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.324
Your husband got fucked.

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:05.961
And everyone calls him a loser.

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.286
Show them wrong.

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:08.811
Why?

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.888
For money?

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.162
For the glory of Panama?

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:20.407
To hell with this nation of hypocrites.

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:21.726
Huh?

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:28.043
If life is such shit, why don't we stop it
like you stopped the fight?

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:30.931
No! No!

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:35.649
Cholo! No! No!

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.682
I'm done.

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.924
Go find another woman.

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:48.520
I can have thousands of women.

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:49.971
I'm taking the kids.

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:51.445
Go to hell, but the kids stay here.

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.961
I'm leaving with my kids!

01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:57.363
The kids are mine.

01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:04.321
What?

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:10.046
Speak for God's sake!

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.400
President Torrijos was killed.

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:47.451
Cholo!

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.244
Get in the ring and I'll kill you.

01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:57.004
Come have lunch with us, kid.

01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:59.049
I don't need your food.

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.361
I earn my meals fighting.

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:02.528
You'll soon be begging for my autograph.

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.126
Well said, champ.

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:05.162
Who says well said?

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:08.363
You are not from El Chorrillo anymore.
"No Mas: sshit from you.

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:13.688
I'll send you to the morgue
and make you quit again!

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:15.848
Ungrateful kid.

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:17.724
It's never enough!

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:21.287
Without Torrijos' leadership
this country will go to shit.

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.683
Let's go home, Robert.

01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:54.686
They are right.

01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:59.801
The hope of El Chorrillo walked away.

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:06.082
I walked away from the fight.

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:10.082
I walked away just like my father.

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:22.969
Yeah!

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:30.890
I let them down.

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:36.607
I let them down and I let you down.

01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:44.607
I don't need to be the champion,
but I need to fight.

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:51.571
I'm going to fight.

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:05.081
I need you to train me, Dad.
Please don't say no.

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.771
I'm sorry. I'm retired.

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:09.086
I can't.

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:10.565
You're my father, man.

01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:12.603
You're the only one I have.

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:14.609
Listen. I-I can't.

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:16.449
I-I'm done with it.

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.289
And it has nothing to do with you.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:20.323
We're talking about me now.
I'm old. I'm tired.

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:21.851
You don't need me.

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.530
You never really did.

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.530
You're a naturally great fighter.

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:29.291
You have great fighter's instincts.

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:30.640
I was just there to support you.

01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:32.091
That's not true.

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:33.645
I need you in my corner, Ray.

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.444
Not anymore, you don't.
You're an adult now.

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:37.050
You have children of your own.

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:38.730
You don't need a father.

01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:41.127
You need somebody to bring
the street back into you.

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:42.651
- Talk to Plomo.
- Plomo?

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:44.125
He knows you better than anybody.

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.810
He's been with you from the beginning.

01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:47.604
I'll help you get a fight.

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:49.290
I'll be watching you all the time.

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.851
But get Plomo to bring you back.

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:52.769
That's who you need.

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:56.089
- Okay.
- And please, always remember.

01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:58.282
The American you're talking to now?

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:00.721
He gave you the best years of his life.

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:14.527
Schmuck.

01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:17.928
You have no reason to feel guilty here.

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:20.042
Well, he's my fighter, so...

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:21.969
Yeah, well...

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:25.482
You need to do what you think
is best for everyone.

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.926
What do you think is best?

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:32.168
It depends.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:35.484
You think that he's the one
that needs you the most right now?

01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:55.448
To prepare him for his comeback,
the first thing Plomo did was take Durán

01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:57.403
to the spiritual heart of Panama...

01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:16.045
...the procession of
the Black Christ of Portobelo.

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:40.680
Plomo had promised Durán when he was a kid

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:44.367
that if he went off track,
he'd take him back to jail.

01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:45.720
So he did.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.961
I made a lot of money on that fight.

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.321
Whatever you need,
the answer's already yes.

01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:09.442
- Roberto Durán.
- Fuck no.

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.842
He's bad news, Ray.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.764
You can do better than that bum.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.286
He needs a comeback.

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:27.050
He quit.

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.844
Understand? You can't do that.

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:30.803
Unless we tell you to.

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.006
No más.

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.168
No más, my ass.

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:38.964
Nobody's gonna pay to see that spick.

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:40.927
How about Davey Moore?

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:42.246
Davey Moore?

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.731
I mean, he's a 24-year-old monster.

01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:45.171
You'll get Durán killed.

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:47.926
Isn't that what everybody wants to see

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:50.202
- after what he did in New Orleans?
- Maybe.

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.926
I certainly would pay
to see Durán get a beating.

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.640
- I'll think about it.
- Okay.

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.000
I'm gonna think about it.

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:35.326
You were the best fighter in the world.

01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:37.488
And I want to see that back in the ring.

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:40.601
You're just happy it will be another
black guy getting punched tonight.

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:42.324
No shit.

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:48.440
Thank you.

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:49.721
Yeah, man.

01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:53.049
And tell your wife...

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:54.924
I'm sorry.

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:01.971
I will.

01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:16.844
Well, tonight happens to be

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:18.724
Roberto Durán's 32nd birthday,
and he's promised to turn

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:23.166
Madison Square Garden's fight
into a party for he and his friends.

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:28.321
- Did Ray come?
- Why are you thinking about Ray?

01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:31.407
I am Sugar Ray Leonard reporting
to you on behalf of CBS Sports.

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.722
Ray, I know you respect your former rival,

01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:40.888
but let's see if he even
finishes this one.

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.444
But Durán's experience is sure to play

01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:51.891
a great deal in the fight tonight.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.845
He started out as a lightweight, and now
he's fighting as a light middleweight.

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.849
Now, that's a tremendous jump
for any fighter.

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:15.166
Okay, I gave both of you
instructions in the dressing room.

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:16.930
I want to remind you.

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.724
Obey my commands at all times.

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:21.534
He is younger, stronger,
with a far longer reach,

01:37:21.635 --> 01:37:24.091
but I can tell you from first,
right and left hand experience

01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:27.010
why they call Manos de Piedra
Hands of Stone.

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:57.127
Moore has power in that right,
and Durán felt it.

01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:18.008
Moore wants to get Durán out of here!

01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:45.800
Can Durán withstand
the punishment he's taking?

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:50.884
We could be seeing the end
of Roberto Durán.

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:03.681
Durán is on the attack.
He is going all in.

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:07.441
How big a risk is this
against the younger Moore?

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:27.127
How are you feeling?

01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:29.681
I wanna take these gloves off and kill him!

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.410
That's the way to do it.

01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:32.362
No mercy.

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.323
Focus on him.

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.442
He's yours. He's already dead.

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.886
Breathe...

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.522
That's it. Let's go.

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:42.602
I love you.

01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:43.682
You know how much.

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:44.921
You are my son.

01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:46.167
You are my hero.

01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:52.087
Durán! Durán! Durán! Durán!

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:16.965
Durán has found
a home for that right hand!

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.366
He's landing it now.

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:40.169
And there's the towel!

01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:48.206
Roberto Durán is the new

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:50.607
super welterweight champion of the world!

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:52.051
And it's his birthday.

01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:12.401
You're back, my love.

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:20.604
Ray!

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:38.811
Happy birthday, Papa!
Happy birthday, Papa!

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:45.000
Happy birthday!

01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:47.322
Yeah! Thank you!
