WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.471
NARRATOR: Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.504 --> 00:05.539
You did work out
in Smith's Cove.

00:05.573 --> 00:07.708
DAN B.: That was put in
by the original people.

00:07.741 --> 00:09.510
RICK: There are pictures,
there are measurements,

00:09.543 --> 00:11.345
but no one has been able
to solve the mystery.

00:11.379 --> 00:12.613
-Yeah.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.248
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-It's right there.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.450
-RICK: That's old. -MARTY:
That has a "45" cut in it.

00:16.484 --> 00:17.685
MARTY:
This is a structure.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.220
There's no doubt about that.

00:19.253 --> 00:21.122
What the heck is this?
Look at that.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.391
-That's a beauty. -Oh, wow.
Look at that! -MARTY: Wow.

00:23.424 --> 00:24.758
GARY:
That is a bobby-dazzler.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.560
MARTY:
That's a fantastic gemstone.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.729
-RICK: This is treasure.
-Congratulations, guys.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.402
NARRATOR: There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:34.435 --> 00:38.139
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.172 --> 00:40.708
for more than 200 years.

00:40.741 --> 00:44.545
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.578 --> 00:47.548
with strange symbols
carved into it,

00:47.581 --> 00:50.218
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.251 --> 00:53.854
and a lead cross whose origin
may stretch back

00:53.887 --> 00:56.590
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:56.624 --> 00:59.460
To date, six men have died

00:59.493 --> 01:02.196
trying to solve the mystery.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.198
And, according to legend,

01:04.232 --> 01:07.368
one more will have to die

01:07.401 --> 01:10.738
before the treasure
can be found.

01:22.583 --> 01:27.355
NARRATOR:
It is a new day on Oak Island.

01:27.388 --> 01:31.492
One of the last before brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina

01:31.525 --> 01:34.828
and members of their team must
suspend operations before

01:34.862 --> 01:37.898
another long,
harsh winter sets in.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.401
So, guys, you know,
we've discussed

01:40.434 --> 01:43.204
our options in this new hole.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.173
TERRY MATHESON:
Ooh!

01:47.741 --> 01:49.377
NARRATOR:
So far this year,

01:49.410 --> 01:51.645
although they have made
a number

01:51.679 --> 01:54.748
of significant discoveries
at both the Money Pit site...

01:54.782 --> 01:56.884
To me, it looks like wood.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.719
-DR. XIANG YANG: It's bone.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.255
It's bone.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.157
-NARRATOR: ...and at
Smith's Cove... -Whoa! Whoa!

02:03.191 --> 02:06.527
-Holy...
-Holy schmoly, all right.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.696
It's a cross.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.232
NARRATOR:
...the team remains frustrated

02:11.265 --> 02:13.301
that efforts to locate
and retrieve

02:13.334 --> 02:14.868
the so-called "Chappell Vault"

02:14.902 --> 02:18.272
have been, so far,
unsuccessful.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.341
Everybody's been close.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.842
You can't help
but be close out there.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.911
There were 44 shafts gone down.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.646
If we actually find
the Chappell Vault

02:25.679 --> 02:27.481
and there's something in it,
it's got to be one

02:27.515 --> 02:29.250
of the greatest stories
ever written,

02:29.283 --> 02:31.585
that all these people,
including us, missed.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.222
So, close doesn't matter.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.489
Close doesn't matter.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.928
NARRATOR: Two weeks ago,
while drilling another

02:40.961 --> 02:43.831
massive 60-inch-wide hole
at the Money Pit site,

02:43.864 --> 02:47.801
the team from Irving Equipment,
Limited encountered

02:47.835 --> 02:53.441
a large metal obstruction
at a depth of 77 feet.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.809
Look at the state of that.
That's been chewed up.

02:55.843 --> 02:59.380
11 out of 36, we ain't gonna
have no... teeth on it.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.881
-We're gonna put the camera in.
-I'm on it!

03:00.914 --> 03:03.617
Let's see what this thing is.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.653
NARRATOR: After attempting
to drain the shaft,

03:05.686 --> 03:07.488
water poured back in.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.323
RICK:
Whoa!

03:09.357 --> 03:11.692
-We're filling full of water!
-Pull it up!

03:11.725 --> 03:12.960
NARRATOR:
...forcing the team

03:12.993 --> 03:14.328
to call in
an experienced diver.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.763
-That ain't good.
-Nope.

03:18.299 --> 03:21.269
What is the can hung up on?

03:21.302 --> 03:23.604
A steel plate?
A cast iron plate?

03:23.637 --> 03:26.240
What's the problem?
Why can't we advance?

03:26.274 --> 03:29.243
We've now rallied
to this consensus

03:29.277 --> 03:31.412
that the best way
to come to an understanding

03:31.445 --> 03:34.448
of what this obstruction is,
is to dive the can.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.950
I think we've rounded
to the fact that

03:36.984 --> 03:39.320
diving is the safest approach
at this point.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.522
So, why don't we call
Mike Huntley,

03:41.555 --> 03:43.257
-Sounds good to me. -All right.

03:43.291 --> 03:47.861
Hopefully, he's ready,
willing and able.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.264
-MIKE: Hello.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.699
-Morning, Mike. -Morning, Mike.
-Hey, Mike.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.501
-Morning, Mike. -GARY: Hi, Mike.
-Hey, Mike.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.735
MIKE:
Hey, guys, how's it going?

03:54.768 --> 03:55.969
-Good. -Good.
-Good, Mike.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.774
NARRATOR:
During the last two years...

04:03.043 --> 04:05.313
...Mike Huntley has been
instrumental in helping

04:05.346 --> 04:07.748
the team in their search
efforts in the Money Pit area.

04:07.781 --> 04:10.451
Three seconds to chair. Over.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.920
Go to chair.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.991
He can leave that sample bag
down there.

04:18.025 --> 04:21.261
Leave the bag there. Get
yourself in the chair. Over.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.937
So, imagine this.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.740
We're on Oak Island,
and we have a problem,

04:32.773 --> 04:34.642
-which you can help us with.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.813
-RICK:
We have undertaken another,

04:39.847 --> 04:42.683
um, hole, with the oscillator.

04:42.716 --> 04:47.287
So, from surface, it would be
77 feet to bottom hole location.

04:49.523 --> 04:50.958
But, here's the...
here's the problem.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.594
Here's what we need you...
need you to assess.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.729
We tried oscillating
the can down.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.766
We hit
a significant obstruction.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.735
And they deduced from that that
they were on significant metals.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.372
They felt it was plate steel.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.974
They could not get through it,
and the chisel--

05:07.007 --> 05:11.044
it's an 8,300-pound
hardened alloy steel chisel--

05:11.078 --> 05:14.548
that actually broke
in several places.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.851
Uh, Charles,
there's nothing down there

05:17.885 --> 05:20.688
-that's indicated by the
archival record? -MIKE: Okay.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.956
No, Mike, this is
what's so strange about it.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.426
There shouldn't be metal
at that level.

05:25.459 --> 05:28.729
I've never read anything,
anywhere

05:28.762 --> 05:30.664
that says there was metal
at this depth.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.834
Certainly, of this thickness
that they can't

05:33.867 --> 05:35.403
get through with the oscillator.

05:37.505 --> 05:40.808
So, we were wondering
if you would be interested

05:40.841 --> 05:44.478
in conducting this dive
to determine

05:44.512 --> 05:48.649
the extent of the obstruction,
and also, is it plate steel?

05:55.856 --> 05:57.425
-RICK: Appreciate it.
-CHARLES: Yeah.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.560
Um, is there anything
we would need,

05:59.593 --> 06:02.430
on our end, to provide to you?

06:08.936 --> 06:10.103
60 inches.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.646
And so, go down,
you'd investigate it,

06:18.679 --> 06:21.649
determine the width
and breadth of it,

06:21.682 --> 06:24.752
uh, perhaps get an understanding
of how thick it is,

06:24.785 --> 06:28.789
uh, is there a concavity to it?
Um...

06:28.822 --> 06:32.560
Basically, determine
its physical dimensions.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.564
So, we all want answers.
This is...

06:36.597 --> 06:39.032
this is
a very strange situation.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.870
RICK:
Mike's been here before.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.105
He's invested in the process.
I mean,

06:45.138 --> 06:47.508
he wants answers
just like the rest of us.

06:47.541 --> 06:50.077
He's enthusiastic
about getting down in that can

06:50.110 --> 06:54.147
and giving us a proper
explanation of what we're on.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.149
-As always, we appreciate it.
-Yeah.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.918
-ALEX: Thanks, Mike.
-Thanks, Mike.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.820
Thanks, Mike.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.722
We'll be in touch.

07:01.755 --> 07:02.856
Yup.

07:08.862 --> 07:13.033
NARRATOR: While the team
from Irving Equipment Limited

07:13.066 --> 07:16.069
disassembles the massive
drilling equipment

07:16.103 --> 07:18.205
in preparation for the upcoming
dive operation

07:18.238 --> 07:20.007
in the D.M.T. shaft...

07:21.709 --> 07:23.577
...Rick and Marty Lagina,

07:23.611 --> 07:26.814
along with Dave Blankenship,
Charles Barkhouse

07:26.847 --> 07:29.149
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton,

07:29.182 --> 07:31.552
are preparing for a new

07:31.585 --> 07:33.654
and more extensive
search for clues

07:33.687 --> 07:36.857
at Smith's Cove.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.059
I'm in my element here.
So, what's going on?

07:39.092 --> 07:41.695
We're going... we're going
to come out here.

07:41.729 --> 07:44.164
NARRATOR: It was here that
just four weeks ago...

07:44.197 --> 07:47.000
GARY:
Holy schmoly, all right!

07:47.034 --> 07:48.769
NARRATOR: ...Rick and Gary
made what could be

07:48.802 --> 07:51.071
the most important discovery

07:51.104 --> 07:52.640
in the history of Oak Island:

07:52.673 --> 07:55.709
a small lead cross.

07:55.743 --> 07:58.846
A cross that is
almost an exact match

07:58.879 --> 08:02.550
for one carved into the wall
of a 14th century prison

08:02.583 --> 08:06.219
in Domme, France by members
of the Knights Templar.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.988
MARTY:
I was ready to put an "X"

08:08.021 --> 08:10.023
through Smith's Cove last year,

08:10.057 --> 08:12.960
but bottom line, a lead cross
came out of that area.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.295
And it could be
very ancient indeed.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.231
RICK:
The search continues to evolve.

08:18.265 --> 08:21.001
Who knows how many more crosses

08:21.034 --> 08:23.937
or items of interest,
uh, may surface?

08:23.971 --> 08:25.939
I'd say we set up right here.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.141
-Right here.
-Okay.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.578
NARRATOR:
Now it is the team's hope

08:30.611 --> 08:32.546
that by expanding their search

08:32.580 --> 08:34.548
in the area where
the cross was found,

08:34.582 --> 08:36.650
they may unearth more clues--

08:36.684 --> 08:38.719
and possibly treasure--

08:38.752 --> 08:41.254
connected to this
incredible artifact.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.090
We're under a time crunch here.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.725
You don't want to be out here

08:44.758 --> 08:45.759
-when the tide comes back.
-No, I don't.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.795
All right, well, let's do it.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.766
NARRATOR:
While the tide remains low,

08:52.800 --> 08:55.068
the team will be able
to conduct their excavation

08:55.102 --> 08:58.772
without the assistance
of any kind of dam.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.207
But they will have to act fast,

09:00.240 --> 09:02.342
as it won't be long before

09:02.375 --> 09:06.747
the water rises
and covers the entire area.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.015
It's gonna get real tricky,

09:08.048 --> 09:09.082
-real fast.
-RICK: I know.

09:12.085 --> 09:15.322
NARRATOR: While Marty uses
the excavator to dig,

09:15.355 --> 09:18.191
Gary scans the spoils

09:18.225 --> 09:21.228
for any potential
metal clues...

09:21.261 --> 09:24.564
and perhaps
more valuable artifacts.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.969
-RICK: Stop!
-CHARLES: Whoa.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.345
Come up.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.648
NARRATOR: ...brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina-- along with

09:40.681 --> 09:43.183
members of their team--
have just encountered

09:43.216 --> 09:45.185
an unusual object.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.389
Uh! I got it.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.158
Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:53.293 --> 09:55.028
Come up.
It's right there.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.164
Something there, he tagged
something right there.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.709
Want a shovel?

10:10.678 --> 10:12.412
RICK:
That's old.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.948
That is old.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.223
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:28.461 --> 10:30.864
CHARLES: There's wood
all through there, Rick.

10:30.898 --> 10:32.065
RICK:
Yup.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.166
MARTY:
This is a structure.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.668
There's no doubt about that.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.704
NARRATOR:
A wooden structure?

10:36.737 --> 10:40.107
Buried beneath the rocks
at Smith's Cove?

10:40.140 --> 10:43.276
Last year, while working
with archeologist

10:43.310 --> 10:46.980
Laird Niven to uncover evidence
of possible box drains

10:47.014 --> 10:48.782
at Smith's Cove,

10:48.816 --> 10:51.752
the Oak Island team unearthed
a French drain:

10:51.785 --> 10:53.987
an ancient kind of
rock formation used

10:54.021 --> 10:56.423
to control the flow of water.

10:56.456 --> 10:59.059
Laird, I'm going to put you
on the spot, now.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.962
Man

11:01.995 --> 11:03.130
-I believe so, yeah.
-Wow.

11:05.265 --> 11:08.201
NARRATOR:
Could this piece of wood

11:08.235 --> 11:10.904
be part of the original
flood tunnel system

11:10.938 --> 11:13.340
that many believe was
constructed centuries ago

11:13.373 --> 11:17.811
to hide something of
incredible value on Oak Island?

11:17.845 --> 11:19.980
CHARLES:
Anything, Gary?

11:20.013 --> 11:22.249
Just some modern stuff.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.051
CHARLES:
Tide's rising, boys!

11:24.084 --> 11:26.286
RICK: Look, we don't have
a lot of time right now.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.188
-It's 5:00.
-It's 5:00...

11:28.221 --> 11:29.723
-and that is low tide right now.
-It's gonna start...

11:29.757 --> 11:30.858
it's gonna start coming in.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.193
So, we could try digging.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.428
At least they could get a look
at this piece of timber.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.230
Try it real quick,
but you're right,

11:37.264 --> 11:38.832
-we don't have much time.
-RICK: I know. Do it.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.300
NARRATOR:
Because the tide

11:40.333 --> 11:42.269
has started to rise,

11:42.302 --> 11:44.104
every second counts

11:44.137 --> 11:46.774
if the team is going to make
what could be

11:46.807 --> 11:48.842
another important discovery.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.112
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:54.281 --> 11:55.983
There's a post right there.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.084
There's something
right there.

12:08.796 --> 12:11.331
That has a "45" cut in it,
so it's not driftwood, right?

12:11.364 --> 12:12.766
RICK:
No.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.237
Rick, do you think that piece,
that did come out

12:17.270 --> 12:18.438
is part of
the U

12:18.471 --> 12:19.506
It almost has to be, right?

12:19.539 --> 12:21.809
Could be.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.477
NARRATOR:
A "U

12:24.511 --> 12:27.147
In the early 1970s,

12:27.180 --> 12:31.051
while searching for the remains
of the flood tunnel system,

12:31.084 --> 12:34.321
Dan Blankenship and
his partner, David Tobias,

12:34.354 --> 12:36.289
constructed a large cofferdam

12:36.323 --> 12:39.159
made of earth
and small boulders,

12:39.192 --> 12:41.428
completely surrounding
Smith's Cove.

12:41.461 --> 12:45.332
After pumping the water out of
the cove, Dan and his team

12:45.365 --> 12:47.935
of workers began excavating.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.871
Although they were unsuccessful

12:50.904 --> 12:53.373
in locating evidence
of the stone box drains,

12:53.406 --> 12:55.809
they did discover
a nearly 65-foot-long

12:55.843 --> 12:58.278
U-shaped wooden structure

12:58.311 --> 13:01.448
near the westernmost
point of the cove.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.317
Upon closer examination,

13:04.351 --> 13:07.420
they found curious notches
every four feet

13:07.454 --> 13:09.990
with Roman numerals
carved next to them--

13:10.023 --> 13:12.559
a numbering system
widely used by Europeans

13:12.592 --> 13:15.462
from the time of
the Ancient Roman Empire

13:15.495 --> 13:20.000
all the way up through
the Middle Ages to 1500 AD.

13:20.033 --> 13:23.436
Unfortunately, before
Dan Blankenship and his team

13:23.470 --> 13:27.040
could complete their
investigation of Smith's Cove,

13:27.074 --> 13:30.077
a severe storm
destroyed the cofferdam

13:30.110 --> 13:34.047
and flooded the cove, leaving
the "U-shaped structure"

13:34.081 --> 13:37.250
a mystery that has remained
to this day.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.455
RICK:
Is that axe

13:42.489 --> 13:43.623
CHARLES:
Yeah.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.893
Water's coming up.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.165
We're not going
to be able to do this.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.369
Not on this scale.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.371
Yeah, I'm getting
a little concerned here.

13:58.405 --> 14:01.008
NARRATOR:
Although the rising tide

14:01.041 --> 14:03.376
has forced the team to suspend

14:03.410 --> 14:05.178
their operations
at Smith's Cove,

14:05.212 --> 14:07.014
they are excited to have found

14:07.047 --> 14:08.882
what could be physical evidence

14:08.916 --> 14:11.885
of the mysterious
"U-shaped structure."

14:11.919 --> 14:13.954
RICK:
If it is original,

14:13.987 --> 14:16.223
by its design, by its use,

14:16.256 --> 14:20.327
the type of construction,
perhaps a carbon date...

14:20.360 --> 14:23.964
I was hoping that that would be

14:23.997 --> 14:27.100
the one thing, the one piece
of irrefutable evidence

14:27.134 --> 14:29.169
that men were here

14:29.202 --> 14:32.339
undertaking a large-scale
project long, long ago.

14:36.609 --> 14:41.048
We have the piece that has
a clear "45" cut on it, right?

14:41.081 --> 14:42.349
So, we got
our carbon dating piece.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.951
Yeah, it's definitely axe-cut.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.485
Look, if it comes back 1400
or something...

14:45.518 --> 14:47.554
-Well, then we're laughing.
-No, then we're...

14:47.587 --> 14:49.456
Then it's worth maybe
coming out here

14:49.489 --> 14:52.659
-and doing a sheet-piling deal,
find out what we got. -Yeah.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.661
We've now acquired
a proper sample.

14:54.694 --> 14:58.331
If that structure comes back
1400, 1500, 1600,

14:58.365 --> 15:01.634
I think then
we set ourselves a new task,

15:01.668 --> 15:05.138
and that is
to properly expose the structure

15:05.172 --> 15:06.940
and determine its use.

15:06.974 --> 15:09.209
I'm getting out of here
before I have to swim out.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.677
DAVE:
I'm going with you, Marty.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.179
MARTY:
Okay, David.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.984
NARRATOR:
Later that same day...

15:17.017 --> 15:19.052
-DAN B.: Come on in.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.989
NARRATOR: ...Rick Lagina
and Charles Barkhouse decide

15:22.022 --> 15:24.024
to follow up on their discovery
at Smith's Cove

15:24.057 --> 15:26.259
with a visit to the home

15:26.293 --> 15:28.495
of veteran Oak Island treasure
hunter Dan Blankenship.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.698
-Sit down.
-RICK: Thank you.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.067
NARRATOR: At 94 years old,
Dan has spent more

15:34.101 --> 15:38.638
than half a century working to
solve the 223-year-old mystery.

15:38.671 --> 15:42.409
His extensive experience
and discoveries

15:42.442 --> 15:45.312
on the island
make him an invaluable resource

15:45.345 --> 15:50.183
and senior advisor to Rick,
Marty and the Oak Island team.

15:50.217 --> 15:54.021
You did work out in Smith's
Cove, and you did a lot of work.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.456
-Yeah, we did quite
a bit of work there. -Right.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.059
It's always been a curiosity
of mine.

15:59.092 --> 16:02.462
-And Charles, you can speak
to it more than I. -Yeah.

16:02.495 --> 16:05.198
CHARLES: I've always been
very curious about

16:05.232 --> 16:07.634
the so-called "U-shaped
structure" that you found, Dan.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.703
-Yeah. That was in '71.
-Yeah.

16:10.737 --> 16:14.207
Dan, do you remember this?

16:14.241 --> 16:16.209
I believe that's you, Dan,
right there.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.445
DAN B.: And that's the U-shaped
structure that we found there.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.480
RICK:
Right.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.749
It was a pretty big structure,
wasn't it? A massive structure.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.118
-Oh, yes.
-Yeah, I mean, look at the size.

16:25.152 --> 16:28.255
-Yeah. -You can gain perspective
by looking at yourself.

16:28.288 --> 16:31.024
Look at how big that timber is.
It's massive.

16:31.058 --> 16:33.126
DAN B.:
Huge logs

16:33.160 --> 16:36.396
that must have been better
than 24 inches in diameter.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.664
CHARLES:
Wow.

16:37.697 --> 16:41.134
DAN B.:
In my opinion, that log would

16:41.168 --> 16:43.070
definitely still be there.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.805
-We didn't try and remove it.
-RICK: So,

16:45.838 --> 16:48.775
it wasn't a beam on top
of a beam on top of a beam?

16:48.808 --> 16:52.279
It wasn't a wall.
That was just one log structure?

16:52.312 --> 16:55.582
-Yeah. -What exactly
did you think it was?

16:55.615 --> 17:00.053
I don't know. I never did come
up with a definitive answer.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.089
At the time we dug it up,

17:02.122 --> 17:05.258
I always felt that was put in
by the original people.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.062
There are pictures,
there are photographs,

17:09.096 --> 17:10.463
there are measurements,

17:10.497 --> 17:12.699
but no one has been able
to articulate

17:12.732 --> 17:15.568
what that structure's
purpose was.

17:15.602 --> 17:19.506
So, the hope is that
we may be able to do that.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.508
Well, I do know this.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.677
I have interest in trying to
come to some sort of certainty

17:24.711 --> 17:27.747
as to its purpose
and who might have done it.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.250
It'd be good to confirm

17:30.283 --> 17:34.087
-that was original.
-Yes.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.589
NARRATOR:
If the section of wooden beam

17:36.623 --> 17:38.725
that was found earlier today
at Smith's Cove

17:38.758 --> 17:43.630
can be carbon-dated
to some time before 1750,

17:43.663 --> 17:47.500
then it might very likely be
part of a structure believed

17:47.534 --> 17:49.469
to have been built
on Oak Island

17:49.502 --> 17:51.838
by the original depositors.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.174
But what was it they deposited?

17:54.207 --> 17:56.209
Gold?

17:56.243 --> 17:58.611
Jewels?

17:58.645 --> 18:01.581
Pirate treasure?

18:01.614 --> 18:05.485
Or was it something
of even greater value?

18:05.518 --> 18:08.555
Something that required an
elaborate system of booby traps

18:08.588 --> 18:11.324
and flood tunnels
in order to prevent it

18:11.358 --> 18:14.327
from ever being discovered.

18:14.361 --> 18:18.465
Well, one way or another,
we'll get to the bottom of that.

18:18.498 --> 18:21.668
-I'll try to make it happen.
-Yeah, okay. I like that.

18:21.701 --> 18:27.407
Good luck.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.277
NARRATOR: While awaiting
the carbon dating results

18:30.310 --> 18:33.380
from the sample taken
from the U-shaped structure,

18:33.413 --> 18:36.416
Rick Lagina,
Dave Blankenship

18:36.449 --> 18:39.919
and Charles Barkhouse
travel more than 50 miles north

18:39.952 --> 18:43.190
to the town
of Wolfville, Nova Scotia.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.625
DAVE: I think we're going
right there.

18:45.658 --> 18:46.926
CHARLES: There we go.
We're-we're right here.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.561
It's a nice house.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.863
NARRATOR:
They have arranged

18:50.897 --> 18:53.366
to meet with the descendants
of one of the men

18:53.400 --> 18:54.867
who worked with Oak Island
treasure hunter

18:54.901 --> 18:58.871
Robert Dunfield
more than 50 years ago.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.541
Let me introduce you
to the rest of the family.

19:01.574 --> 19:04.911
RICK: Harold Bishop's grandson
called Charles and indicated

19:04.944 --> 19:07.514
to Charles that he had
an artifact from the island.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.848
He felt it was
of sufficient interest

19:08.881 --> 19:11.451
that we should come and visit.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.754
So, we called you about the
piece that my grandfather found

19:14.787 --> 19:17.324
when he was working
on the island.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.826
-Okay. -He was the crane
operator or bucket operator.

19:19.859 --> 19:23.196
-Okay, that definitely would be
Dunfield then. Yes. -TROY: Yeah.

19:23.230 --> 19:26.533
NARRATOR:
In 1965,

19:26.566 --> 19:29.402
California geologist
turned treasure hunter,

19:29.436 --> 19:32.305
Robert Dunfield,
came to Oak Island,

19:32.339 --> 19:36.609
determined to recover the
Chappell Vault first reported

19:36.643 --> 19:40.747
by William Chappell
and Frederick Blair in 1897.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.783
In what is still to this day

19:43.816 --> 19:47.420
the largest excavation of
the Money Pit ever attempted,

19:47.454 --> 19:49.822
Dunfield and members
of his team--

19:49.856 --> 19:52.559
which included
crane operator Harold Bishop--

19:52.592 --> 19:58.565
dug a massive 100-foot wide
and 143-foot deep hole.

19:58.598 --> 20:03.002
Unfortunately, Dunfield's
operation was no match

20:03.035 --> 20:05.438
for the believed
booby-trapped flood tunnels.

20:05.472 --> 20:08.841
The hole caved in
just a few feet

20:08.875 --> 20:11.511
from the Chappell Vault's
reported depth,

20:11.544 --> 20:14.714
and Dunfield and his team left
empty-handed.

20:14.747 --> 20:17.917
Or so everyone thought.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.886
Our family connection really

20:19.919 --> 20:22.021
intrigues us
to want to know more

20:22.054 --> 20:23.790
of the story
and want to see what happens

20:23.823 --> 20:27.327
and how things evolve
on the island.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.729
Yeah, and thought maybe you
might be interested in seeing,

20:29.762 --> 20:31.931
-you know, what he brought home.
-CHARLES: Well, yeah.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.767
We'd love to see it.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.238
Here it is.

20:46.513 --> 20:49.649
CHARLES: It's a pretty thick
piece of wood.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.720
RICK:
It's certainly very interesting.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.489
CHARLES: So, this actually came
out of the Money Pit area?

20:56.523 --> 20:58.725
I believe
that's where it's from.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.393
-CHARLES: From the excavation
that he was working with. -Yes.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.594
-Yes.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.029
-Wow.
-TROY: I believe

21:03.062 --> 21:05.432
-he put the plaque on himself.

21:05.465 --> 21:06.999
Oh, wow.
: Yeah.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.571
-CHARLES:
Look how tight those grains are.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.706
RICK:
Did he ever speculate

21:13.740 --> 21:15.308
about what type of wood
this was?

21:15.342 --> 21:16.543
LYNN:
I don't remember him saying,

21:16.576 --> 21:18.044
but he seemed to think

21:18.077 --> 21:20.613
that perhaps it might have been
part of a ship.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.915
NARRATOR:
Wood

21:22.949 --> 21:26.319
Found deep within
the Oak Island Money Pit?

21:26.353 --> 21:29.055
Could it have come
from the same ship

21:29.088 --> 21:32.992
that treasure hunter Fred Nolan
believed was deliberately sunk

21:33.025 --> 21:36.929
and then buried in what is now
the Oak Island swamp?

21:36.963 --> 21:40.700
If so, how did a portion
of that ship

21:40.733 --> 21:43.670
happen to be buried deep
in the Oak Island Money Pit?

21:43.703 --> 21:45.338
What I'm thinking, though,

21:45.372 --> 21:47.039
it could be part of the rudder.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.709
-For the slots in here

21:49.742 --> 21:51.844
for moving back and forth, Rick.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.880
'Cause it'd be thick enough.

21:53.913 --> 21:57.016
'Cause they're fairly
substantial.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.951
See the... that would be the...

21:58.985 --> 22:00.853
Oh, there's a dowel.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.689
LYNN:
A dowel or a nail.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.624
-A nail. No, it's a nail.
It's a nail.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.527
-Right there. And there was one
right here, too. -LYNN: Yeah.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.496
RICK: To me, it looks...
it definitely looks

22:09.529 --> 22:11.931
-like a square nail. -Yep.
No. It is.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.601
It's square.
That nail is interesting

22:14.634 --> 22:17.937
-because if it's brass
or bronze... -Yes.

22:17.970 --> 22:21.908
...uh, early bronze nails
is what they used on ships.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.911
I found eight pages

22:24.944 --> 22:26.145
of what looks like a ship's log.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.847
NARRATOR:
A few weeks ago,

22:27.880 --> 22:30.149
Oak Island researcher
Doug Crowell

22:30.182 --> 22:31.684
presented the team

22:31.718 --> 22:33.820
with a translation
of a ship's log

22:33.853 --> 22:35.622
reported to have come

22:35.655 --> 22:39.091
from a failed
French naval expedition in 1746

22:39.125 --> 22:41.160
led by the duc d'Anville,

22:41.193 --> 22:42.829
a descendant of a family

22:42.862 --> 22:45.498
connected
to the Knights Templar.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.834
"It has been agreed
that a deep pit be dug

22:47.867 --> 22:49.769
and treasure securely buried."

22:49.802 --> 22:51.971
In my mind, they're pointing
right to Oak Island.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.906
Well, it's almost too perfect.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.643
NARRATOR: Could this
mysterious piece of wood

22:56.676 --> 22:59.045
be connected
to the duc d'Anville's mission

22:59.078 --> 23:02.181
to bury a priceless treasure
in a pit

23:02.214 --> 23:05.117
dug deep beneath the surface
of Oak Island?

23:05.151 --> 23:08.154
RICK: The wood in and of itself
was interesting.

23:08.187 --> 23:10.590
It was very thick-- probably
over three inches thick.

23:10.623 --> 23:13.125
It had routered grooves in it

23:13.159 --> 23:15.462
that could have been done
by hand

23:15.495 --> 23:17.163
with a chisel and a hammer.

23:17.196 --> 23:19.599
But to me,
the most interesting thing

23:19.632 --> 23:22.835
was they had square-cut nails
in the corners

23:22.869 --> 23:25.738
right outside
these mitered grooves.

23:25.772 --> 23:27.173
So, there's a lot of information

23:27.206 --> 23:30.443
on a little 12x12 piece of wood.

23:30.477 --> 23:32.479
I guess it begs the question--
at least in my mind.

23:32.512 --> 23:35.214
And, you know,
are you interested at all

23:35.247 --> 23:38.618
in perhaps aging it?

23:38.651 --> 23:41.187
Species identification
of the wood?

23:41.220 --> 23:44.223
Uh, we could do
scanning electron microscope

23:44.256 --> 23:46.793
-on the metals.
-On the nails. Yeah.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.896
I think Dad would...
would really want that.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.531
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.232
To know more about it?

23:53.265 --> 23:55.668
I think he would have loved
to have known more about it.

23:55.702 --> 23:57.103
RICK:
The excitement is there

23:57.136 --> 23:58.805
in that piece of wood.
We can analyze it.

23:58.838 --> 24:01.240
We can have someone
render opinion about it.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.875
But the disturbing aspect

24:02.909 --> 24:04.744
of being presented these items

24:04.777 --> 24:06.946
is how much more is out there?

24:06.979 --> 24:09.682
Are there artifacts that we are
currently unaware of?

24:09.716 --> 24:12.118
And that's really
what draws my attention

24:12.151 --> 24:13.920
to these items.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.154
-We want to say thank you.
-TROY: Thank you.

24:15.187 --> 24:16.756
Thank you for reaching out.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.224
Thank you for the stories.

24:18.257 --> 24:19.526
Thank you for the interest.

24:25.565 --> 24:28.067
RICK:
So, John, welcome back.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.002
NARRATOR:
Three days after obtaining

24:30.036 --> 24:32.038
a piece of the so-called
"U-shaped structure"

24:32.071 --> 24:33.940
buried at Smith's Cove,

24:33.973 --> 24:36.108
Rick Lagina
and members of the team

24:36.142 --> 24:39.045
gather in the war room
to hear the results

24:39.078 --> 24:42.682
of the scientific testing
conducted on the sample.

24:42.715 --> 24:45.284
We did retrieve samples
from that structure

24:45.317 --> 24:47.119
that's on the-the map.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.655
I think you'll find

24:48.688 --> 24:50.557
what we're about to do
interesting.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.124
NARRATOR:
The team has also invited

24:52.158 --> 24:54.794
geophysical engineer
John Wonnacott

24:54.827 --> 24:56.596
to take part in the meeting.

24:56.629 --> 24:59.766
John had conducted
a previous investigation

24:59.799 --> 25:02.769
into the possible origin
of the U-shaped structure

25:02.802 --> 25:06.005
more than 30 years ago
for Dan Blankenship,

25:06.038 --> 25:08.908
although the results
were not definitive.

25:08.941 --> 25:11.811
RICK: John has actually
retrieved a piece

25:11.844 --> 25:13.880
of the U-shaped structure
in the past.

25:13.913 --> 25:16.749
He obtained a piece
of the left arm,

25:16.783 --> 25:18.751
if you will.

25:18.785 --> 25:22.088
And aside from John
and Daniel Blankenship,

25:22.121 --> 25:23.556
those are the only two people

25:23.590 --> 25:25.091
who have ever seen
this structure.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.959
Craig has the reports

25:26.993 --> 25:29.929
on a piece we believe came
from the U-shaped structure.

25:29.962 --> 25:32.865
I think we'll get them up here
on the line,

25:32.899 --> 25:34.300
and see what Craig has to say.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.268
This suld be interesting.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.271
Hi, guys.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.140
-Hey, guys.

25:41.173 --> 25:43.275
NARRATOR: Joining the team
via videoconference,

25:43.309 --> 25:45.244
from their offices
in Traverse City, Michigan,

25:45.277 --> 25:47.580
are Rick's brother Marty,

25:47.614 --> 25:50.817
and their friend and business
partner Craig Tester.

25:50.850 --> 25:53.720
You guys have the reports
about the U-shaped structure.

25:53.753 --> 25:54.887
We do.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.923
And that's why John is invited.

25:56.956 --> 26:00.359
He has a fascination with
that structure, as does Charles.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.729
And also of particular interest,

26:02.762 --> 26:05.698
the results of the wood
that Harold Bishop had found

26:05.732 --> 26:07.166
in the Dunfield excavation.

26:07.199 --> 26:11.103
Okay. So, the wood
that had the wormholes in it

26:11.137 --> 26:15.675
ranges from 1684 to 1732.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.614
So the-the second one,

26:21.648 --> 26:26.986
the Dunfield wood,
is from 1646 to 1690.

26:29.956 --> 26:32.058
So, you know, we found
a lot of things, it seems like,

26:32.091 --> 26:34.694
this year,
that fit in that time period.

26:34.727 --> 26:39.999
I think that the-- at least
the one probability curve

26:40.032 --> 26:42.101
for the U-shaped structure

26:42.134 --> 26:45.371
is very similar to the dates
we got from the human bones.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.674
-CRAIG: Yeah, I sure do.

26:47.707 --> 26:53.179
The Middle Eastern bone
is 1682 to 1736, so...

26:53.212 --> 26:55.014
-That's virtually the same.
-Yeah.

26:57.984 --> 27:00.753
NARRATOR:
The wood from Smith's Cove,

27:00.787 --> 27:02.889
and the human bones found
earlier this year

27:02.922 --> 27:04.390
at the Money Pit,

27:04.423 --> 27:07.760
all dating
from before the mid

27:07.794 --> 27:11.163
Could the Laginas and their
partners have finally found

27:11.197 --> 27:14.066
physical evidence of human
activity on Oak Island

27:14.100 --> 27:16.769
that proves that the legends

27:16.803 --> 27:19.305
about an elaborate engineering
project being conducted

27:19.338 --> 27:22.408
before 1750 are true?

27:22.441 --> 27:27.346
And, if so, does that mean
they are closer than ever

27:27.379 --> 27:30.416
to solving
the Oak Island mystery?

27:30.449 --> 27:33.686
So what we're left with
is a big mystery.

27:33.720 --> 27:37.156
I would have to say,
if we have the budget,

27:37.189 --> 27:39.826
we should have another go
at that U-shaped structure

27:39.859 --> 27:41.293
and actually unearth it.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.995
I don't think
we've figured it out.

27:43.029 --> 27:45.698
There's enough interest,
I think,

27:45.732 --> 27:47.800
to expose it once and for all.

27:47.834 --> 27:50.369
Oh, yeah. Part of the U-shaped
structure that you dug

27:50.402 --> 27:52.772
had to be part of the south arm.

27:52.805 --> 27:55.141
-Yes, it was.
-And that's smaller diameter.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.910
I think it's really, very
interesting and very valuable,

27:57.944 --> 28:01.413
in my opinion,
to get the base log exposed.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.950
-Mm-hmm. -If we get a match
for the base log,

28:03.983 --> 28:06.252
then we'll get a year.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.220
And that would tell the tale.

28:08.254 --> 28:11.057
RICK: With the proper permits
and the proper controls,

28:11.090 --> 28:13.993
that will totally encompass
and allow us to excavate

28:14.026 --> 28:16.963
and expose
the U-shaped structure.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.898
It's gonna take
a new cofferdam to do it.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.332
Um...

28:20.366 --> 28:22.034
-And a bigger one.
-And a bigger one.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.302
It just means
that we're probably

28:23.335 --> 28:25.104
not going to do it this year,

28:25.137 --> 28:27.006
because we have to recamp
and rethink about it.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.942
Okay, guys, look, you know,

28:29.976 --> 28:33.212
U-shaped structure, not busted.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.114
-Not analyzed, either.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.482
We need to do
a little more work.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.751
Well, we definitely need
a battle plan

28:38.785 --> 28:40.352
if we're gonna go after it.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.154
-All right. Good job, guys.
-See you.

28:42.188 --> 28:43.222
-RICK: See you.
-DAVE: Take care.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.438
RICK:
Okay.

28:59.471 --> 29:01.407
NARRATOR:
With three days remaining

29:01.440 --> 29:04.510
until the team's dive operation
at the Money Pit...

29:04.543 --> 29:07.013
RICK:
Give me my tools.

29:07.046 --> 29:11.350
...Rick Lagina and metal
detection expert Gary Drayton

29:11.383 --> 29:13.986
have decided to investigate
an area on the island

29:14.020 --> 29:19.225
that they believe might offer
some important clues: Lot 8.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.493
We've come to realize

29:21.527 --> 29:23.562
how important
metal detecting is,

29:23.595 --> 29:25.531
in terms of furthering
the search.

29:25.564 --> 29:28.034
And with the end of the year
fast approaching,

29:28.067 --> 29:29.568
weather closing in,

29:29.601 --> 29:31.370
the idea is to get out there
with Gary

29:31.403 --> 29:33.439
and see what else
we can come up with.

29:33.472 --> 29:36.342
RICK: I'd like to go in here
and do some metal detecting.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.410
GARY: Yeah, that's good.
I'll turn it on.

29:43.282 --> 29:46.285
NARRATOR: It was here,
just one week ago,

29:46.318 --> 29:49.355
that the team unearthed
a remarkable find.

29:49.388 --> 29:51.157
GARY:
Look at that.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.059
-It's a little ornate...
-MARTY: Oh, my goodness.

29:53.092 --> 29:54.560
GARY:
...lock plate?

29:54.593 --> 29:57.429
NARRATOR:
A mysterious key plate,

29:57.463 --> 29:59.498
one they believe
could be connected

29:59.531 --> 30:01.868
to the 18th century
Oak Island landowner

30:01.901 --> 30:06.005
and privateer
Captain James Anderson.

30:09.008 --> 30:11.110
RICK:
Pretty thick in there.

30:11.143 --> 30:14.146
This place looks
like virgin ground.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.381
RICK:
If you find something in here,

30:15.414 --> 30:17.183
it's not going to be a pull tab.

30:17.216 --> 30:19.986
GARY: Yeah, I know,
I have a feeling it isn't.

30:20.019 --> 30:23.489
This is the quietest area
I've seen.

30:23.522 --> 30:26.058
All it takes is one good signal.

30:29.561 --> 30:31.097
That sounds good.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.598
GARY:
Yeah, it does.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.434
This is a bit bouncy.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.036
I normally wouldn't
dig this, but...

30:38.604 --> 30:41.607
...as I've got
a good digger with me.

30:45.077 --> 30:48.280
See? That disappeared,
and then came back.

30:48.314 --> 30:50.182
RICK:
Is that good or bad?

30:50.216 --> 30:51.918
GARY:
I don't know.

30:59.291 --> 31:00.526
GARY:
Oh.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.494
Oh, there it is.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.396
Something round.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.365
Could it be a coin?

31:06.398 --> 31:10.569
If it's a coin, it'd be
a good one, being that small.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.506
Dab-nabbit.
I can feel a little...

31:14.540 --> 31:17.209
-Yeah, a little tab on the back.

31:17.243 --> 31:19.178
-RICK: That's what I thought.
-Yeah, it's a button.

31:19.211 --> 31:22.681
Still in good condition
for a little cuff button.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.417
Yeah, it's definitely...
looks like it's military.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.685
RICK:
Oh, yeah.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.921
-That's hard to date.

31:28.955 --> 31:32.458
I'd say 1780 to 1820.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.326
Straddles the beginning
of the search era.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.295
Yeah.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.630
NARRATOR: If the button
can be dated to sometime

31:38.664 --> 31:42.668
between the late 1700s
to the early 1800s,

31:42.701 --> 31:46.672
it was most likely left behind
by a former landowner

31:46.705 --> 31:51.443
or perhaps one of the first
treasure hunters on Oak Island.

31:51.477 --> 31:55.414
But if it is determined
to be from an earlier period,

31:55.447 --> 31:57.616
could it have once belonged
to one of the men

31:57.649 --> 31:59.986
who buried treasure here?

32:00.019 --> 32:02.354
If you can find buttons,
you can find coins.

32:02.388 --> 32:04.223
That's how it normally goes.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.292
I'll dig up whatever you find.

32:06.325 --> 32:09.461
All right, mate. So,
I was going this way, I think.

32:09.495 --> 32:11.563
-Yeah.

32:17.669 --> 32:20.072
See, there's some iron
around there.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.307
That nearly tricked me.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.511
I was going slow enough

32:25.544 --> 32:29.081
to detect the good target
next to the iron.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.722
RICK:
That sounds good.

32:36.755 --> 32:39.358
-Oh, that's good,
that it's deeper.

32:39.391 --> 32:40.659
RICK:
Mm-hmm.

32:46.032 --> 32:48.267
What the heck is this?

32:50.769 --> 32:54.206
Oh, I know what that would've
been. That would've been, like,

32:54.240 --> 32:57.543
-a cameo brooch-type thing.
Yeah.  Yeah.

32:57.576 --> 33:00.479
-This could be really old.
-Mm-hmm.

33:00.512 --> 33:03.449
NARRATOR: An ornate brooch
found in the area

33:03.482 --> 33:05.284
where the team
recently discovered part

33:05.317 --> 33:08.120
of a possible treasure chest?

33:08.154 --> 33:10.589
So, a little bit of jewelry.

33:10.622 --> 33:13.192
-I wonder if it's
in there still. -Yeah.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.394
-I want to check the hole.
-Yeah.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.432
-Yeah, I think so.

33:20.466 --> 33:23.369
Okay.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.404
You don't think there's
something that--

33:25.437 --> 33:28.507
-Uh, could be anywhere.

33:28.540 --> 33:31.710
The only way to know is
if we was to come back

33:31.743 --> 33:34.546
with, like, a little sieve
and just a sifter.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.383
-Yeah, and just dig it out.

33:37.416 --> 33:39.618
-I'd leave the hole open,

33:39.651 --> 33:42.054
so we know where it is.

33:42.088 --> 33:44.790
All right,
I'll continue, will I?

33:51.230 --> 33:53.432
That was weird. Look.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.534
Look at this, Rick.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.703
-We've got it. We've got it.

33:57.736 --> 34:00.339
There was a bit of metal
in, uh, the thingy.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.840
-Oh, wow! Look at that.
-Look at that. That's a beauty!

34:01.873 --> 34:03.509
That is beautiful.

34:03.542 --> 34:04.843
That bloody well is, isn't it?

34:04.876 --> 34:06.778
Wow.

34:06.812 --> 34:08.780
Look at how many facets on that.

34:08.814 --> 34:11.650
GARY:
That is a bobby-dazzler.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.685
That's gorgeous.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.522
Now we know why we always
recheck the hole, don't we?

34:16.555 --> 34:19.391
-Look at that.
-Oh, man.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.429
It's cut. Look. It's cut.

34:23.462 --> 34:25.464
The facets on it?
Yeah, look at that.

34:25.497 --> 34:27.466
Yeah, it is!

34:27.499 --> 34:29.535
Rick, we've just found a jewel.

34:39.545 --> 34:41.480
-RICK: Wow.
-GARY: That's a beauty.

34:41.513 --> 34:43.382
Look at how many facets on that.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.717
NARRATOR:
While metal detecting on Lot 8,

34:45.751 --> 34:48.854
Rick Lagina and Gary Drayton
have just made

34:48.887 --> 34:52.224
what could be
a major historic discovery,

34:52.258 --> 34:56.562
an object that looks to be
some sort of gemstone or jewel.

34:56.595 --> 34:59.331
Wow, it is beautiful.
Look at the color on that.

34:59.365 --> 35:00.866
Isn't that pretty?

35:00.899 --> 35:03.602
That is fantastic.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.771
That's gorgeous.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.506
-GARY: This is exciting.
-Mm-hmm.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.508
That is a beautiful thing.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.610
Look at the colors in that.

35:11.643 --> 35:14.513
Nice, rich, dark red.

35:14.546 --> 35:17.216
Do you think that's a ruby?

35:17.249 --> 35:19.185
NARRATOR:
A ruby?

35:19.218 --> 35:21.320
Could Rick and Gary
have just found

35:21.353 --> 35:23.722
a genuine piece
of antique jewelry?

35:23.755 --> 35:26.458
But, if so, how old is it?

35:26.492 --> 35:30.462
And how did it come
to Oak Island?

35:30.496 --> 35:33.499
RICK:
A brooch with a ruby set in it?

35:33.532 --> 35:35.534
We're both aghast.

35:35.567 --> 35:39.705
I mean, could this be the first
sign of real treasure?

35:39.738 --> 35:41.607
This, truly--

35:41.640 --> 35:43.942
well and truly--
is a significant find.

35:43.975 --> 35:47.646
There must be...

35:47.679 --> 35:51.417
one, two, three, four, five,

35:51.450 --> 35:55.254
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

35:55.287 --> 35:58.490
11, 12, maybe.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.359
12 facets.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.861
GARY:
Yeah, that's old. That's 1700s.

36:02.894 --> 36:05.197
And remember, Rick,
back in the day,

36:05.231 --> 36:06.798
you know,
they did things properly.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.767
This is...

36:08.800 --> 36:12.338
I mean, who would've worn that?

36:12.371 --> 36:16.275
NARRATOR: If the deep red stone
is determined to be authentic,

36:16.308 --> 36:18.844
it is likely one
of the first genuine pieces

36:18.877 --> 36:22.581
of antique jewelry
to be found on Oak Island.

36:22.614 --> 36:26.318
But was it brought here
as part of a pirate's treasure,

36:26.352 --> 36:29.721
perhaps once belonging
to the 18th century privateer,

36:29.755 --> 36:32.691
Captain James Anderson?

36:32.724 --> 36:37.463
Or could it be of even greater
monetary or historical value?

36:38.664 --> 36:41.367
In 1792,

36:41.400 --> 36:43.835
as the French Revolution
reached its most violent

36:43.869 --> 36:45.737
and bloody phase,

36:45.771 --> 36:49.341
Queen Marie Antoinette
was facing a gruesome death

36:49.375 --> 36:51.743
under the blade
of a guillotine.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.581
Hoping to escape,

36:55.614 --> 36:57.549
she employed one
of her servants

36:57.583 --> 37:00.018
to smuggle her jewels out
of the castle,

37:00.051 --> 37:03.622
in hopes they could be used
to purchase the queen's safety,

37:03.655 --> 37:06.792
along with that of her family.

37:06.825 --> 37:10.362
Unfortunately,
the plan didn't work.

37:10.396 --> 37:13.031
Both Marie Antoinette
and her husband,

37:13.064 --> 37:16.302
King Louis XVI, were executed.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.739
Strangely, however,

37:20.772 --> 37:23.742
the queen's jewels
were never found.

37:23.775 --> 37:25.911
For years, rumors abounded

37:25.944 --> 37:28.714
that the queen's servant
had secured passage on a ship

37:28.747 --> 37:31.283
headed for North America

37:31.317 --> 37:32.918
and that the queen's jewels

37:32.951 --> 37:36.322
were buried somewhere
on Oak Island.

37:36.355 --> 37:39.057
It was this theory
that attracted the attention

37:39.090 --> 37:41.059
of a 27-year-old
treasure hunter

37:41.092 --> 37:43.462
from Hyde Park, New York,

37:43.495 --> 37:46.898
the future 32nd president
of the United States,

37:46.932 --> 37:49.635
Franklin D. Roosevelt.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.838
You know,
I've-I've long wondered

37:52.871 --> 37:55.674
what compelled FDR
to become involved.

37:55.707 --> 37:59.378
He was interested in the
Marie Antoinette connection,

37:59.411 --> 38:02.481
the disappearance
of the French Crown Jewels.

38:02.514 --> 38:07.853
We found one brooch
with a stone in it.

38:07.886 --> 38:10.889
My mind went to the FDR belief,

38:10.922 --> 38:13.759
but we never really
substantiated it.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.762
Perhaps there's more information
to be gleaned.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.564
You know, Gary, it's such
a remarkable find,

38:18.597 --> 38:21.400
I think I should call
my brother, everyone up there.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.934
Everybody should come down
and take a look at this.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.704
I-It's just absolutely stunning
and beautiful.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.580
Hey, Gary and I found something

38:34.613 --> 38:37.048
and, uh, I think you guys will
be interested in seeing it.

38:37.082 --> 38:39.685
Why don't you come down
and take a look?

38:39.718 --> 38:41.687
Okay.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.122
If it's a ruby, even if
it's a semiprecious stone,

38:44.155 --> 38:46.825
this is treasure, as defined
by the treasure trove license.

38:46.858 --> 38:50.596
So, you know, I guess
pat on the back to all of us.

38:50.629 --> 38:51.897
You know, we found treasure.

38:55.634 --> 38:58.370
Might it be part of some sort
of original deposition?

38:58.404 --> 39:01.807
It's possible. Again, we need
experts to weigh in.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.108
MARTY:
All right, all right.

39:03.141 --> 39:04.876
He's grinning
like a Cheshire cat.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.014
Uh, well, we'll start off
with a few finds.

39:09.047 --> 39:10.949
Yeah, all top pocket finds.

39:10.982 --> 39:13.752
We was kind of, like,
disappointed when we found it.

39:13.785 --> 39:15.554
It looks like a brooch.

39:15.587 --> 39:16.822
GARY:
Yeah, it's like a brooch.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.391
Beautiful brooch.

39:19.425 --> 39:21.660
-RICK: And then...
-GARY: And then,

39:21.693 --> 39:24.796
we checked the hole
and we found the jewel.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.898
-MARTY: Wow.
-JACK: Oh, man.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.600
RICK:
12 facets.

39:28.634 --> 39:30.168
-GARY: I think so.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.903
-Wow.
-RICK: We hope so.

39:31.937 --> 39:34.105
If that's a ruby, that's
a fantastic ruby, isn't it?

39:34.139 --> 39:37.142
Yeah. It's about a three-karat
ruby if it's a ruby.

39:37.175 --> 39:39.511
I'm hoping that it tells a story
because...

39:39.545 --> 39:41.880
Don't chip at the mount
because the mount will tell,

39:41.913 --> 39:44.683
-perhaps, some story.
-GARY: The design.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.184
CHARLES:
Way to go, Gary.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.819
-That's a nice find.
-Not every day you find

39:47.853 --> 39:50.088
a jewel on Oak Island.

39:50.121 --> 39:52.390
CHARLES:
Absolutely.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.795
Beautiful color.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.597
Well, beautiful piece
of jewelry.

39:58.630 --> 40:00.666
CHARLES:
Yeah.

40:00.699 --> 40:02.634
-No, you can't do the gold
dance, can you? -GARY: No.

40:02.668 --> 40:03.969
Let's see the ruby dance.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.840
MARTY: It's a gemstone
set in a brooch.

40:08.874 --> 40:11.209
And Gary's convinced
that it's ancient.

40:11.242 --> 40:14.546
And he's good.
He's not often wrong.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.548
-He's better than good.
-Yeah.

40:16.582 --> 40:18.484
I'm not talking
about metal detecting.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.852
He's good at determining
what things are.

40:20.886 --> 40:23.622
And a gemstone,
a significant--

40:23.655 --> 40:25.524
he thought
three-karat gemstone--

40:25.557 --> 40:29.027
might open all kinds
of doors up.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.463
Well, this needs
to get to a jeweler, ASAP.

40:31.497 --> 40:33.164
I don't know what to say, Gary.

40:33.198 --> 40:35.534
Well done, for sure,
very well done.

40:35.567 --> 40:37.235
-Yeah.
-Pretty cool.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.704
-Very cool.
-So we've got another

40:38.737 --> 40:40.539
hot little area here now.

40:40.572 --> 40:42.107
Yeah. So I take it you're gonna
work that area again?

40:42.140 --> 40:45.210
-Oh, we're gonna hammer it.

40:45.243 --> 40:48.013
Congratulations, guys.

40:48.046 --> 40:50.949
MARTY:
Good job, guys. Excellent job.

40:50.982 --> 40:53.652
NARRATOR:
After a week which began

40:53.685 --> 40:56.755
with frustrating setbacks
at the Money Pit,

40:56.788 --> 40:58.924
the discovery of what could be

40:58.957 --> 41:01.593
an actual piece
of the Oak Island treasure

41:01.627 --> 41:04.796
has convinced the team that the
answers they've been seeking

41:04.830 --> 41:07.533
might be closer
than they believed.

41:07.566 --> 41:10.769
But now that they appear
to be on the brink

41:10.802 --> 41:13.939
of an incredible breakthrough,
will they find the object

41:13.972 --> 41:16.107
that generations
of treasure hunters

41:16.141 --> 41:19.945
have been looking for
for more than two centuries?

41:19.978 --> 41:24.516
Or will it lead them
to an even greater discovery,

41:24.550 --> 41:28.554
one they could never
have imagined?

41:28.587 --> 41:31.056
Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:31.089 --> 41:33.058
a special season finale.

41:33.091 --> 41:36.294
I took the gem to a gemologist.

41:36.327 --> 41:40.198
It's a 500-year-old stone.

41:40.231 --> 41:41.700
MAX:
Get him in the water.

41:41.733 --> 41:43.735
-Eyes and boots.
-Yes!

41:43.769 --> 41:47.305
RICK: What is down there
and can we get it out?

41:47.338 --> 41:48.707
They found something, Rick.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.842
Oak Island is for real.

41:50.876 --> 41:52.844
-A lot of this looks spendable,
David. -Yes.

41:52.878 --> 41:54.780
-I say we celebrate.

41:54.813 --> 41:56.948
-There's treasure on Oak Island.
-JACK: Yeah!
