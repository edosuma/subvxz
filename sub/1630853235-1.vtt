WEBVTT

01:36.098 --> 01:37.138
- Damn.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.706
What the hell?

01:53.989 --> 01:55.750
- You patch that hol?

01:56.791 --> 01:57.752
- I'm working on it.

02:00.291 --> 02:02.892
- Oh yeah, that always does it.

02:02.994 --> 02:03.792
- Why's that?

02:04.895 --> 02:07.333
- I've worked this unit every
year, and it's like clockwork.

02:07.435 --> 02:10.501
Tenants never stay long, and
that hole is always there.

02:15.074 --> 02:16.408
- We can smoke in here?

02:17.947 --> 02:19.908
- No, Chad, I can smoke in.

02:20.010 --> 02:20.841
- Man.

02:22.046 --> 02:22.876
- Now listen.

02:24.017 --> 02:25.681
I did hear this story.

02:26.921 --> 02:27.914
That cavity in the wal?

02:30.153 --> 02:31.225
It's alive.

02:33.156 --> 02:34.426
It's waiting.

02:37.127 --> 02:37.957
It's hungry.

02:39.596 --> 02:41.928
And if you stare at
that long enough,

02:43.971 --> 02:45.837
it becomes a glory hol.

02:48.041 --> 02:49.839
- Man, stop playing with me.

02:49.941 --> 02:51.311
- Listen.

02:51.413 --> 02:54.980
Sun's down, scrape out the
damp, cover it with wallpaper,

02:55.083 --> 02:57.246
and I'm not paying overtim.

02:57.348 --> 02:58.246
- I need at least another hour.

02:58.348 --> 03:00.286
- No, we'll do it tomorrow.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.216
We need to drag this ot
a few more days anyway.

03:02.318 --> 03:03.983
So just go home.

03:05.156 --> 03:05.990
You need a ride?

03:06.092 --> 03:06.890
- My girl's meeting me.

03:06.992 --> 03:08.194
- All right.

03:08.296 --> 03:09.058
Well, lock up before
you leave, all right?

03:09.160 --> 03:10.363
- You got it, boss.

03:22.373 --> 03:25.279
Man, this is fucking bullshit.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.757
What the fuck?

04:37.115 --> 04:38.352
- Hey, Mister.

04:39.415 --> 04:40.954
Sorry I'm late.

04:41.056 --> 04:42.521
- Look who finally showed up.

04:43.585 --> 04:44.924
- And look what I brought.

04:45.026 --> 04:46.525
- Is that a four-pack?

04:48.859 --> 04:51.159
- Two might've disappeared
on the way over here.

04:51.261 --> 04:52.564
- Yeah, sure.

04:53.867 --> 04:54.698
Thanks.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.338
- Oh, wow.

04:59.073 --> 05:00.099
- That's cool, right?

05:02.403 --> 05:03.443
- Hmm.

05:06.781 --> 05:07.612
- Okay.

05:10.247 --> 05:11.077
Wait, wait.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.048
I got something for it.

05:22.261 --> 05:23.762
- You got that for me?

05:23.864 --> 05:24.963
- Yeah.

05:25.065 --> 05:25.960
Here, turn around.

05:31.939 --> 05:33.904
Let me see.

05:34.006 --> 05:35.269
- Hmm.

05:35.371 --> 05:36.575
Do you like?

05:41.211 --> 05:42.042
- I love.

05:47.385 --> 05:49.753
And you need another beer.

06:07.138 --> 06:08.167
- Lena?

06:10.539 --> 06:11.577
Baby, you okay?

06:15.245 --> 06:16.076
Lena!

06:17.214 --> 06:18.718
Lena!

06:18.820 --> 06:20.019
Oh, fuck.

06:20.121 --> 06:20.987
Stay with me, stay with me.

06:21.089 --> 06:21.955
Look at me, look at me.

06:22.057 --> 06:23.252
Lena, baby, no, no, no, no.

06:23.354 --> 06:24.788
Help, somebody!

06:25.455 --> 06:26.727
Look at me, Lena.

06:26.829 --> 06:28.024
Please help!

06:28.126 --> 06:29.561
Oh, fuck!

06:29.663 --> 06:33.492
Okay, I'm gonna get help,
okay, I'm gonna get help.

07:29.290 --> 07:31.151
- You're making a huge mistake.

07:39.498 --> 07:41.502
- She's a bad influence on you.

08:33.919 --> 08:37.958
You step out that door,
don't come back to us

08:38.060 --> 08:38.922
asking for help.

08:53.568 --> 08:54.608
- Kim!

08:56.307 --> 08:57.336
- Hey.

08:58.411 --> 09:00.179
- This place is lit, right?

09:00.281 --> 09:01.879
- So cool, I love the floor.

09:05.451 --> 09:07.016
- Where's your mom and dad?

09:08.554 --> 09:10.753
Still not a fan of mine, huh.

09:10.855 --> 09:12.890
- Not a fan of either
of us right now.

09:13.792 --> 09:15.088
I'm just happy
you're here with me.

09:15.191 --> 09:16.991
- I'm just happy to
ride out your coattails

09:17.093 --> 09:19.426
when you become like,
a famous journalist.

09:20.196 --> 09:22.128
Or if I make it before
then, I'm gonna give yu

09:22.230 --> 09:25.467
an exclusive article
on how fabulous I am.

09:41.682 --> 09:42.722
- Hi.

09:43.489 --> 09:44.856
- I like your hat, man.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.189
- I'm Ronan, the landlord.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.559
You're moving into
room 203, right?

09:51.661 --> 09:52.765
- That's us, yeah.

10:04.578 --> 10:06.647
This is the same
building, right?

10:07.647 --> 10:09.309
- This was an old
commerce building.

10:10.386 --> 10:12.014
The bank was on the first,

10:12.116 --> 10:13.813
the other floors were
converted to apartments

10:13.915 --> 10:15.216
during the Depression.

10:16.153 --> 10:20.526
We take first, last,
plus damages, cash onl,

10:20.628 --> 10:23.059
for tenants like
you with no credit.

10:23.859 --> 10:25.094
That's how it's done.

10:28.831 --> 10:31.032
There's no parking included.

10:31.134 --> 10:34.902
No smoking, no loud
noise after nine p.m.,

10:35.004 --> 10:38.508
no cats, no dogs,
and the basement

10:38.610 --> 10:40.879
is off limits to residents.

10:42.917 --> 10:45.881
This is the last floor to be
renovated in the building.

10:45.983 --> 10:47.520
The other units on
this floor are empty,

10:47.622 --> 10:49.750
so it's just yours
here that's available

10:49.852 --> 10:51.285
and mine back over there.

11:11.106 --> 11:14.143
All original
pre-war furnishings.

11:15.045 --> 11:17.542
Utilities are included
in the monthly.

11:18.612 --> 11:22.184
All furnishings are required
to remain in the apartment.

11:25.522 --> 11:26.760
- Wow.

11:27.392 --> 11:28.421
Oh my...

11:29.624 --> 11:30.423
Yes!

11:31.628 --> 11:33.030
This'll do.

11:33.962 --> 11:35.698
This will do just fine.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.534
- It's better than the photos.

11:37.636 --> 11:39.237
Definitely vintage vibes.

11:39.339 --> 11:40.040
You concur?

11:40.142 --> 11:41.137
- I concur.

11:52.153 --> 11:53.483
Whoa.

11:53.585 --> 11:55.151
This is beyond.

11:56.251 --> 11:57.554
- It reminds me of
that messed up play

11:57.656 --> 11:59.155
that you did freshman year.

12:00.054 --> 12:01.795
- "Murder at the Cathedral."

12:06.631 --> 12:07.801
- Don't touch that!

12:09.432 --> 12:13.206
This is an historic building,
and under no circumstances

12:13.308 --> 12:14.434
can that be damaged.

12:16.542 --> 12:17.371
- Got it, dude.

12:19.512 --> 12:20.473
- Are we good here?

12:47.571 --> 12:48.809
- Yay.

14:40.717 --> 14:41.955
- Hey.

14:43.456 --> 14:44.287
- Hey.

14:46.827 --> 14:48.219
She said this was
the only picture

14:48.321 --> 14:49.655
where her hair looked nice.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.336
- Her hair always looked good.

15:02.541 --> 15:03.372
- Yeah.

15:11.850 --> 15:13.483
- I call wheelbarrow.

15:13.585 --> 15:14.245
- No.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.787
- That was your mom's rules.

15:15.889 --> 15:17.716
Sad girl goes in
the wheelbarrow.

15:22.727 --> 15:23.759
Wheelbarrow.

15:28.567 --> 15:29.094
Let's go!

15:33.704 --> 15:34.733
Whoa!

15:36.039 --> 15:37.806
- Blood surging to my head.

15:41.349 --> 15:42.180
- Sorry.

15:42.977 --> 15:44.017
Dang.

15:47.049 --> 15:48.820
Fuck, I'm dizzy.

15:48.922 --> 15:50.718
Oh, you know what
I just remembered?

15:50.820 --> 15:51.651
- What?

15:52.726 --> 15:54.153
- It's a margarita Thursday.

15:54.255 --> 15:56.394
- That's not a thing.

15:56.496 --> 15:57.123
- Why?

15:57.225 --> 15:58.498
I just made it a thing.

15:58.600 --> 15:59.859
It's margarita Thursda.

15:59.961 --> 16:01.231
- I can't.

16:01.333 --> 16:03.663
I have orientation day
the day after tomorrow.

17:36.895 --> 17:38.196
- Hey, it's me.

17:38.298 --> 17:39.831
I just want to let you know
that we got all moved in

17:39.933 --> 17:41.695
and the place is really good.

17:44.198 --> 17:45.303
And I'm happy.

17:47.374 --> 17:50.805
Okay, I'm gonna try again
tomorrow after my first day.

17:50.907 --> 17:51.738
Love you.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.448
- Hi.
- Good morning.

18:01.717 --> 18:05.521
- I think I dreamt I peed
on the roof last right.

18:11.629 --> 18:14.530
- Wait, no, I think you did
pee on the roof last night.

18:15.836 --> 18:17.632
- Round two tonight, baby.

18:21.006 --> 18:22.636
That's not what I'm saying.

18:22.738 --> 18:25.306
What I'm saying is that
99% of college students

18:25.408 --> 18:27.847
go to orientation
with a hangover.

18:27.949 --> 18:29.775
I think it's like
a rite of passage.

18:29.877 --> 18:32.784
- If I even look at tequila
tonight I'm gonna vomit.

18:32.886 --> 18:35.188
- Dude, just drink win.

18:35.885 --> 18:37.289
Ew!

18:37.391 --> 18:39.219
- I know, I tried to hang
the mirror there last night,

18:39.321 --> 18:40.685
but the nail didn't hold.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.756
Found it on the
floor this morning.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.229
Ew, it's fine.

18:48.331 --> 18:50.101
We'll just ask Ronan to fix it.

18:50.203 --> 18:53.734
- I think I see something.

18:54.870 --> 18:56.872
- Izzy, don't, you know
you're just gonna mess it up.

18:56.974 --> 18:58.211
- No, hold on.

18:59.013 --> 19:00.642
- Don't.
- Oh no, it's fine.

19:04.618 --> 19:05.915
- Izzy!

19:13.728 --> 19:14.253
- You're kidding!

19:14.355 --> 19:15.428
You're...

19:15.530 --> 19:16.490
Asshole.

19:16.592 --> 19:19.693
- I told you I was
gonna be a superstar.

19:19.795 --> 19:22.895
My pictures everywhere and
everyone knows my name.

19:24.368 --> 19:26.136
- Was that in the wall?
- Yeah.

19:26.238 --> 19:28.566
- Let me see it.
- Finders keepers.

19:28.669 --> 19:30.637
- Well, I don't want to ke.

19:30.739 --> 19:32.040
There's probably mold
on it or something.

19:32.142 --> 19:33.410
- Oh, whatever.

19:33.512 --> 19:35.476
This is vintage, and Im
the queen of vintage.

19:35.578 --> 19:38.215
- Mm-hmm, more like
queen of tetanus.

19:38.317 --> 19:40.381
- That's a good one, actually.
- Thank you.

19:40.483 --> 19:42.050
- Get ready, we're
going out tonight.

19:58.735 --> 20:00.534
- Okay, so, your mom ad
dad, wouldn't let you

20:00.636 --> 20:01.873
hang in high school,
and then what?

20:01.975 --> 20:02.841
They disown you now, o?

20:02.943 --> 20:04.238
- They don't disown me.

20:04.340 --> 20:06.879
They're just really strict.

20:06.981 --> 20:09.207
- It's 'cause I went to rehab.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.715
- Oh.

20:10.817 --> 20:12.148
Damn, well...

20:12.250 --> 20:14.347
- Not for alcohol, you jackass.

20:14.449 --> 20:16.322
- Well, then for what?

20:17.620 --> 20:19.824
- None of your
business, stranger.

20:19.926 --> 20:22.191
- My name is Steve.

20:22.293 --> 20:24.028
- Oh, well good for you, Steve.

20:24.130 --> 20:25.591
- Anyway, we're roommates now,

20:25.693 --> 20:27.963
and I start at the
college tomorrow.

20:28.065 --> 20:29.300
- Okay, cool.

20:29.403 --> 20:30.933
All right, so you guys
are going to college.

20:31.035 --> 20:32.030
That's cool.

20:32.904 --> 20:33.735
- Not me.

20:35.506 --> 20:38.242
- Well, what are
you gonna do, then?

20:38.344 --> 20:39.911
- Oh, you know, just
probably thinking

20:40.013 --> 20:41.406
I'm gonna drink a lot here.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.814
- She's an actress.

20:43.916 --> 20:44.746
- Thanks babe.

20:48.755 --> 20:49.553
- Man.

20:51.123 --> 20:52.622
You're so fucking so hot.

20:53.386 --> 20:55.022
- Don't.

20:55.124 --> 20:55.922
- What?

20:57.162 --> 20:58.695
- Dude, what are you doing?

20:59.764 --> 21:03.402
- Calm down, we're all just,
we're hanging out here, right?

21:06.905 --> 21:07.703
Bitch.

21:11.305 --> 21:12.205
- Shit.

21:48.048 --> 21:49.448
I'm sorry, we'll be quieter.

22:04.397 --> 22:06.591
- You know, I didn't
tell you how much

22:06.693 --> 22:08.060
that punch turned me o.

22:09.767 --> 22:12.497
- You know, we could
try something like that

22:12.599 --> 22:14.104
if you want, huh?

22:14.206 --> 22:15.870
You can slap me or...

22:18.578 --> 22:21.381
Look, we don't have to
if you don't want, but...

22:29.052 --> 22:29.884
Hey.

22:39.197 --> 22:40.466
Man, what the fuck?

23:20.533 --> 23:21.639
Holy shit.

24:05.579 --> 24:06.948
What the fuck?

27:13.471 --> 27:15.337
- Morning, sunshine.

27:18.411 --> 27:19.575
It's orientation day.

27:19.677 --> 27:21.681
I told you I wouldn't fail you.

27:29.216 --> 27:31.389
- I heard some weird
noises last night.

27:31.491 --> 27:33.357
- Oh dude, I didn't hear shit.

27:33.459 --> 27:35.024
And that guy must've left.

27:36.296 --> 27:37.961
What's his name?

27:40.397 --> 27:41.296
- Tony?

27:41.398 --> 27:42.234
- Tony!

27:42.336 --> 27:44.167
Dude, I totally forgot.

27:44.269 --> 27:45.100
But yeah.

27:47.505 --> 27:48.571
- How's your hand?

27:48.673 --> 27:52.440
- Oh, you know, it's all good.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.411
- What time is it?
- It's only 11.

27:57.513 --> 27:58.379
- Shit!

27:58.481 --> 27:59.719
- What?

28:00.747 --> 28:01.787
- God.

28:02.488 --> 28:04.086
Orientation already started.

28:26.178 --> 28:27.010
No!

28:29.479 --> 28:30.877
Excuse me?

28:30.979 --> 28:33.117
I'm here for the orientation.

28:33.219 --> 28:34.050
Please?

28:35.783 --> 28:36.822
- You're late.

28:38.592 --> 28:40.452
Orientation ended
15 minutes ago.

28:44.524 --> 28:48.129
I was giving the orientation
tour, so in exchange

28:48.231 --> 28:51.901
for an extra hot non-fat
sugar-free vanilla latte,

28:52.003 --> 28:55.467
I'll give you the
exclusive Ian tour for one.

28:57.540 --> 28:58.276
- Really?

28:58.378 --> 28:59.207
That's your drink?

29:00.180 --> 29:01.011
- Yeah.

29:01.974 --> 29:02.742
- I'm kidding.

29:02.844 --> 29:03.882
You got a deal.

29:04.847 --> 29:06.181
- Need your name first.

29:07.154 --> 29:08.152
- Kim.

29:08.254 --> 29:09.553
- Ian.

29:09.656 --> 29:11.890
- I got that from the tour.

29:13.286 --> 29:14.826
- It's all about the web p.

29:14.928 --> 29:18.495
You'll access the live
lectures, round tables there.

29:18.597 --> 29:19.964
Has its own social network.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.536
I'm not really giving
you any gold here.

29:24.638 --> 29:26.432
You don't have to
write it all down.

29:27.300 --> 29:28.740
What are you
majoring in, anyway?

29:28.843 --> 29:31.373
- Journalism, but I
want to minor in psych.

29:31.475 --> 29:32.374
- Nice.

29:32.476 --> 29:33.278
Yeah.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.372
I'm a junior now.

29:34.474 --> 29:36.710
I'm doing journalism
too, but I'm focusing

29:36.812 --> 29:37.744
on video journalism.

29:37.846 --> 29:39.450
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:39.552 --> 29:40.545
Just it's the future.

29:41.482 --> 29:44.054
Information's become
democratized on the we.

29:44.686 --> 29:45.922
- Yeah.

29:46.024 --> 29:48.452
I think that's part of
the problem, though.

29:48.555 --> 29:50.289
I mean, any idiot with
an internet connection

29:50.392 --> 29:53.195
can take a video of
themselves and call it news.

29:54.300 --> 29:55.300
- Touche.

29:55.402 --> 29:56.868
What about you?

29:56.970 --> 30:00.472
- Call me romantic, but
I think there's something

30:00.574 --> 30:02.567
special about the written word.

30:04.475 --> 30:06.343
Like I...

30:06.445 --> 30:07.538
I don't know.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.011
I think there's something
special about the process

30:09.113 --> 30:11.578
of real journalism,
and it helps people.

30:12.347 --> 30:13.952
- I hate to break it
to you, but that means

30:14.054 --> 30:17.453
you're gonna be taking a couple
courses with Dr. Phillips.

30:17.555 --> 30:18.918
- Is that bad?

30:19.020 --> 30:21.025
- Dude is a complete ass.

30:22.189 --> 30:24.558
- He was must've given you a C.

30:24.660 --> 30:25.461
- C minus.

30:26.998 --> 30:29.030
So you came here
for spring semester,

30:29.132 --> 30:31.165
and your friend came
to pursue acting?

30:31.267 --> 30:36.071
- Yeah, but we just
wanted to get away.

30:36.173 --> 30:38.636
I was being suffocated
by my mom and dad.

30:39.577 --> 30:40.407
But Izzy...

30:41.982 --> 30:44.883
She was struggling aftr
her mom passed away.

30:44.985 --> 30:49.317
So I wanted to help her,
and it kinda helps me too.

30:50.524 --> 30:51.924
She's like family, so.

30:53.456 --> 30:56.289
- There's a story for Dr.
Phillips' class right there.

30:56.392 --> 30:58.023
You could write about
how you help a friend

30:58.125 --> 30:59.525
cope with loss, you know?

31:00.628 --> 31:03.399
Anyway, you're lucky to have
a friend that's like family.

31:03.501 --> 31:04.601
- Yeah.

31:04.703 --> 31:06.605
It's cool.

31:06.707 --> 31:08.807
And we found this
amazing apartment.

31:08.909 --> 31:12.406
I mean, it's amazing
and creepy, kind of.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.112
But we can afford it, so.

31:16.280 --> 31:19.615
- I've actually got ths
little protest today

31:19.717 --> 31:20.920
I'm gonna cover.

31:25.724 --> 31:27.025
See you on the portal.

31:29.525 --> 31:32.932
- Thanks for the in-person
lesson on isolated education.

31:51.945 --> 31:52.945
- Hey.

31:53.047 --> 31:54.684
Just getting back.

31:54.786 --> 31:55.751
Haven't heard from you.

31:55.853 --> 31:57.088
Gonna go to bed soon.

32:15.804 --> 32:16.635
Izzy?

32:22.616 --> 32:24.676
Hey, what's with the smell?

32:26.848 --> 32:27.679
Izzy?

34:57.163 --> 34:58.866
Living...

34:58.968 --> 35:00.870
In the wake...

35:00.972 --> 35:03.241
Of an accidental overdose...

35:05.407 --> 35:07.212
Doesn't always feel like l.

35:20.959 --> 35:22.458
It's more like surviva.

35:24.726 --> 35:26.594
Like you've been kissed
by death and the shadow

35:26.696 --> 35:30.169
that looms in the aftermath is
a reminder that you're next.

35:33.702 --> 35:36.241
I watch helplessly as t
stalks my best friend.

35:39.042 --> 35:40.476
It has come close.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.578
The shadow gave her
a fistful of pills

35:47.680 --> 35:49.782
on a beautiful of
Fourth of July.

35:54.261 --> 35:56.695
But the subsequent fireworks
that burst inside her

35:56.797 --> 35:57.955
didn't finish the job.

36:01.466 --> 36:04.896
She refuses the call to
the other side, but...

36:10.910 --> 36:12.244
The shadow is patient.

37:01.860 --> 37:03.020
What the fuck?

38:41.794 --> 38:42.354
Izzy.

38:42.456 --> 38:43.256
What are you doing?

38:49.066 --> 38:51.568
Izzy!

38:57.008 --> 38:58.008
Hey, wake up.

38:58.110 --> 38:59.807
Wake up, Izzy, please?

39:01.143 --> 39:02.108
I'm here.

39:02.210 --> 39:03.041
It's okay.

39:05.315 --> 39:07.144
- She's still with us.

39:13.124 --> 39:14.558
I can feel her.

39:18.325 --> 39:19.156
- Shh.

40:31.030 --> 40:34.132
Well, I had two
visitors last night.

40:36.439 --> 40:39.808
An imaginary bird, then you.

40:41.080 --> 40:42.074
- Was the bird cute?

40:45.952 --> 40:46.914
Was I cute?

40:51.123 --> 40:52.315
I'm sorry, Kim.

40:52.417 --> 40:54.856
I put the two and two together
when I woke up in your bed.

40:55.558 --> 40:57.991
But I don't remember anything.

41:00.197 --> 41:01.232
- Izzy, last-

41:01.334 --> 41:02.699
- You liked your
smoothie, right?

41:04.863 --> 41:07.405
- I like my sleep more.

41:07.507 --> 41:09.841
- I used to sleep
walk when I was a kid.

41:09.943 --> 41:10.773
It'll stop.

41:12.643 --> 41:15.013
And if it doesn't,
you won't even know,

41:15.115 --> 41:16.548
'cause I installed a lock.

41:35.401 --> 41:37.195
- So what were you
up to last night?

41:38.533 --> 41:40.002
- I've met someone.

41:40.104 --> 41:41.137
- Hmm.

41:41.239 --> 41:42.269
What's his name?

41:42.371 --> 41:43.201
- Her name.

41:45.309 --> 41:46.910
- Congratulations?

41:47.012 --> 41:48.140
- Sandy.

41:48.242 --> 41:51.977
Her name is Sandy, and I met
her last night at the bar.

41:52.079 --> 41:55.052
She is a casting
assistant to this lady.

41:55.154 --> 41:55.950
And guess what?

41:57.788 --> 41:59.958
She's getting me an
audition for this TV show

42:00.060 --> 42:01.017
that she's doing.

42:01.119 --> 42:03.255
- Congratulations!

42:03.357 --> 42:07.196
- When I get the part, taking
you to your first strip club.

42:07.298 --> 42:09.132
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.

42:14.068 --> 42:16.801
- I was gonna tell you
about it last night,

42:16.903 --> 42:20.612
but I met someone too, a guy.

42:22.882 --> 42:23.714
Ian.

42:25.052 --> 42:26.077
And I like him.

42:26.180 --> 42:29.315
I think I'm gonna let
him take me on a date.

42:29.417 --> 42:30.714
- What?!

42:30.816 --> 42:32.624
- Oh, are you okay?

42:33.389 --> 42:34.824
- Yeah, sorry.

42:36.222 --> 42:39.061
My cramps are really
kicking my ass today.

42:39.163 --> 42:40.224
- Okay.

42:40.326 --> 42:41.958
There's aspirin in the
cabinet over the stove.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.295
Drink more water, less tequila.

42:45.401 --> 42:46.231
- Whatever.

42:47.971 --> 42:51.005
- The SPJ code of ethics
is a great place to start.

42:51.107 --> 42:54.073
You should always run through
the checklist to ensure that

42:54.175 --> 42:57.011
you are delivering your
content in a way that

42:57.113 --> 43:00.485
you're both proud of and that
will stand up to scrutiny.

43:00.587 --> 43:03.153
My office hours are
available as usual.

43:03.255 --> 43:04.782
Thank you, everyone.

43:04.884 --> 43:06.658
- Excuse me, Dr. Phillips?

43:08.093 --> 43:08.891
- Yes.

43:10.163 --> 43:11.955
- Yeah, I just...

43:12.058 --> 43:13.022
I wanted to ask a questiont

43:13.125 --> 43:14.831
my personal experiences ar,

43:14.933 --> 43:18.065
because what I'm writing about
isn't technically about me,

43:19.299 --> 43:24.709
it's about my friend and
her personal experiences,

43:25.944 --> 43:28.142
some difficult situations and
how I've seen it affect her.

43:28.244 --> 43:33.652
And I think it'd be important
for me too, just be cathartic.

43:34.719 --> 43:36.012
I'm not gonna say
her name or anything,

43:36.115 --> 43:37.750
but I was wondering if youk

43:37.852 --> 43:39.724
I need to get her permission.

43:40.890 --> 43:42.725
- You should act
independently here.

43:42.828 --> 43:44.690
As long as you aren't
putting her in any danger

43:44.792 --> 43:46.390
or betraying her trust.

43:47.534 --> 43:48.764
- Yeah, I just feel
it's important.

43:48.866 --> 43:50.862
I don't think she'd
understand right now

43:50.964 --> 43:52.671
what I'm trying to do with it.

43:54.607 --> 43:56.174
- As long as you
leave her anonymous,

43:56.276 --> 43:57.568
I think you'll be fine.

43:57.670 --> 43:58.710
Good luck.

44:01.973 --> 44:03.048
- Thank you, Doctor.

44:04.344 --> 44:06.044
I was just getting some
help from the professo.

44:06.146 --> 44:08.079
- So the audition's
today, and then

44:08.181 --> 44:10.253
Sandy's taking me
out for drinks after.

44:10.355 --> 44:11.890
- Casting couch.

44:11.992 --> 44:13.353
Nice.

44:13.455 --> 44:14.324
- Please.

44:14.426 --> 44:16.155
You should go see that boy.

44:16.257 --> 44:19.492
Give your mom and dad a big
fuck you by fucking him.

44:25.197 --> 44:27.337
- All right, I'll see you .

44:27.439 --> 44:29.073
- Good luck, love you.

44:29.175 --> 44:30.071
- Love you!

45:08.741 --> 45:09.748
- Stay.

45:31.398 --> 45:34.866
So then she punched this
guy in the face.

45:34.968 --> 45:36.841
I think he was knocked out.

45:37.808 --> 45:39.206
- Remind me not
to piss Izzy off.

45:39.308 --> 45:42.443
She sounds cool, I just don't
want to go down like that.

45:44.945 --> 45:46.411
How'd her mom pass awa?

45:48.247 --> 45:50.521
Sorry, I shouldn't
have asked that.

45:50.623 --> 45:51.587
Sorry, it's the
journalism thing,

45:51.690 --> 45:53.356
it's ruined my social etiq.

45:53.458 --> 45:54.518
- No, no, it's fine.

45:55.690 --> 45:57.125
She just...

45:58.859 --> 46:00.161
It was an overdose.

46:01.130 --> 46:02.697
And the thing about
it was I think she was

46:02.800 --> 46:04.294
the happiest person that I.

46:04.396 --> 46:07.970
I mean, I loved
Leanna, and I had just

46:08.072 --> 46:10.601
no idea that that's wht
she was going through.

46:11.370 --> 46:14.076
And I think she was
going through that

46:15.045 --> 46:16.274
and she was just this
light in our lives,

46:16.377 --> 46:18.676
then what does that
mean for the rest of u?

46:18.778 --> 46:19.811
- Sorry.

46:19.913 --> 46:21.083
Just can't imagine.

46:22.014 --> 46:23.184
- It crushed Izzy.

46:24.383 --> 46:26.423
The worst part about
it is that I let

46:26.525 --> 46:28.187
my parents run my life.

46:28.289 --> 46:31.158
They wouldn't let me
over there to see her.

46:31.260 --> 46:35.966
They thought I'd overdose
by osmosis or something.

46:37.670 --> 46:39.464
So I couldn't go to the fu.

46:41.400 --> 46:44.808
When she needed me
most, she called me

46:44.910 --> 46:48.847
and asked me to be
there, I didn't show u.

46:52.312 --> 46:54.616
And then the next
thing that I heard,

46:54.718 --> 46:56.316
she was in the hospita.

46:57.819 --> 46:59.220
She tried to...

47:02.594 --> 47:03.895
She took a bunch of pills.

47:04.889 --> 47:05.930
So.

47:08.134 --> 47:11.969
I just promised myself that I
would always be there for her.

47:13.272 --> 47:14.305
Sorry.

47:14.407 --> 47:15.907
- Don't apologize.

47:22.314 --> 47:23.145
Come on.

47:25.617 --> 47:26.885
I'll take you for a ride.

47:27.718 --> 47:29.320
- You don't have a car.

47:29.422 --> 47:30.647
- Yeah, I know.

47:32.993 --> 47:36.590
When's the last time you
rode on a pair of handlebars?

47:45.804 --> 47:48.165
This is better
than a car, right?

47:48.268 --> 47:50.601
- It's kinda scary!
- I know.

47:51.709 --> 47:52.407
- How fast are we goin?

47:52.509 --> 47:53.069
- Fast!

47:53.171 --> 47:54.377
Five miles per hour.

48:01.685 --> 48:04.582
- Woohoo!

48:12.495 --> 48:13.294
Woo!

48:15.667 --> 48:17.468
- You almost got me killed.

48:17.570 --> 48:19.971
- You almost got you killed.

48:20.073 --> 48:24.202
- I'd invite myself up, but
actually really sweaty now.

48:24.304 --> 48:26.540
- Good, 'cause I
would've said no.

48:26.642 --> 48:27.506
Go shower.

48:29.109 --> 48:30.410
- Can I see you again?

48:32.683 --> 48:37.956
- Uh-huh.

49:31.573 --> 49:34.505
- Hello, you've
reached Samuel and Anne White,

49:34.607 --> 49:36.744
please leave us a
message after the tone.

49:37.715 --> 49:39.444
- Hi, it's me again.

49:39.547 --> 49:43.421
I just want to tell you
how it's going here.

49:43.523 --> 49:45.390
I like my classes.

49:45.492 --> 49:46.651
We're doing good.

49:47.520 --> 49:50.824
I guess call me back
if you have time,

49:50.926 --> 49:51.957
or want to talk,

49:54.697 --> 49:55.431
Shit!

49:55.533 --> 49:56.364
Oh...

50:30.762 --> 50:32.803
- I had a really good
time with you today.

50:32.905 --> 50:35.634
I really wanna kiss yo.
- Yeah?

50:36.808 --> 50:39.077
Well why don't you do it?

51:41.232 --> 51:42.272
- Izzy?

51:58.887 --> 51:59.883
Izzy?

52:02.120 --> 52:02.919
Hey.

52:03.926 --> 52:04.822
Are you okay?

52:08.227 --> 52:09.332
Are you awake?

52:14.806 --> 52:16.471
It's me, Kimmy.

52:18.610 --> 52:19.170
Izzy?

52:20.878 --> 52:22.106
Hey, are you...

52:25.112 --> 52:27.650
Izzy, wait.

52:34.858 --> 52:39.263
Fuck.

53:03.083 --> 53:03.881
Izzy?

53:07.792 --> 53:08.822
Izzy, please?

53:08.924 --> 53:09.722
It's me.

53:36.887 --> 53:38.014
Izzy, please.

53:39.287 --> 53:40.819
Please, where are you?

54:11.756 --> 54:12.521
Izzy?

54:43.249 --> 54:44.080
Izzy?

54:50.996 --> 54:53.364
Izzy, where are you going?

54:54.462 --> 54:57.800
Izzy, wait!

55:39.810 --> 55:40.940
Hey.

55:41.042 --> 55:42.305
Hey.

55:42.407 --> 55:43.447
Izzy.

55:48.820 --> 55:49.986
It's okay.

55:50.088 --> 55:52.285
It's all right, Izzy.

55:52.387 --> 55:54.150
You're gonna be safe.

55:57.158 --> 55:57.989
Okay.

55:59.163 --> 56:01.763
You're gonna be all right.

56:01.865 --> 56:02.697
Shh.

56:13.504 --> 56:14.544
I'm here.

56:17.915 --> 56:18.746
I'm here.

56:35.430 --> 56:37.193
- I don't understand.

56:39.300 --> 56:40.504
- It's okay.

56:41.703 --> 56:44.269
I think you just
need to stay in bed.

56:44.371 --> 56:45.674
You need rest.

56:46.606 --> 56:48.039
And please don't drink.

56:49.879 --> 56:53.247
I don't know what that was
last night, but it scared me.

56:53.349 --> 56:55.953
- I'm not gonna drink.

56:56.055 --> 56:58.085
I have a call back today.

56:58.187 --> 56:59.215
- Drink this.

57:07.429 --> 57:09.731
- My head really hurts.

57:11.303 --> 57:13.163
- I think it might
just be stress.

57:15.338 --> 57:17.337
Can you see a doctor?

57:17.439 --> 57:18.905
- I don't have insurance.

57:19.875 --> 57:22.078
And like, I don't know,
but they're not gonna

57:22.180 --> 57:23.609
let me take sleeping pills.

57:23.711 --> 57:25.113
- No, that's not
what I was saying.

57:25.215 --> 57:26.176
I don't want that.

57:34.186 --> 57:38.160
- Do you ever feel like
you're watching your dreams,

57:38.262 --> 57:39.893
but you're not part of them?

57:43.429 --> 57:44.260
- No.

57:48.505 --> 57:50.233
- Well, that's
what it felt like.

58:00.518 --> 58:02.448
- I feel like
I'm talking crazy.

58:02.550 --> 58:04.283
- No, no, you're not.

58:04.385 --> 58:05.751
This is real.

58:05.853 --> 58:08.119
You weren't sleepwalking,
you were awake.

58:09.161 --> 58:10.687
- Well, what do I do?

58:10.789 --> 58:12.222
I need to do something.

58:14.559 --> 58:15.599
- Dig.

58:16.462 --> 58:17.834
- What?

58:17.936 --> 58:18.761
- Dig.

58:18.863 --> 58:20.030
Research, investigate.

58:20.132 --> 58:22.197
That's what we're
supposed to do, right?

58:22.300 --> 58:25.171
There's always an answer,
you just have to dig.

58:25.273 --> 58:26.238
- Right.

58:26.340 --> 58:27.375
Yeah.

58:27.478 --> 58:29.780
- Just can't judge what we.

58:29.882 --> 58:31.008
- We?

58:31.110 --> 58:33.584
- You'll need like a
research assistant.

58:38.788 --> 58:41.016
- Will you come to
the apartment with me?

58:41.118 --> 58:42.956
- Finally, you're
inviting me up.

58:46.126 --> 58:48.090
- Just don't talk to hr
about it though, pleas.

58:48.192 --> 58:49.932
I just want you to
see the place first.

58:50.034 --> 58:52.701
Maybe there's like
radon poisoning
happening or something.

58:52.803 --> 58:54.203
- I don't think radon makes
you sleepwalk yourself

58:54.305 --> 58:55.203
down to the basement.

58:55.305 --> 58:56.974
- What the hell?

59:18.228 --> 59:19.964
- Is she gone?

59:20.066 --> 59:24.364
- I don't know.

59:27.370 --> 59:28.270
- Can I help you?

59:28.372 --> 59:29.304
- Do you know this guy?

59:29.406 --> 59:30.641
- He's my landlord.

59:32.772 --> 59:34.304
- I came to treat the glass.

59:36.081 --> 59:37.141
- Oh, okay.

59:37.243 --> 59:39.215
Can you let me know in
advance when you're gonna be

59:39.317 --> 59:40.778
coming into the apartment?

59:40.881 --> 59:42.686
- You went down to the bas.

59:44.557 --> 59:47.284
The basement is off
limits to residents.

59:48.787 --> 59:50.287
Don't go down there.

1:00:02.166 --> 1:00:05.241
- Your landlord's
kind of a dick.

1:00:05.343 --> 1:00:08.409
- Yeah.

1:00:08.511 --> 1:00:10.747
- This thing is horrifying.

1:00:12.210 --> 1:00:14.316
You ever seen stained
glass like this?

1:00:14.418 --> 1:00:15.752
- No.
- Me neither.

1:00:36.103 --> 1:00:37.601
- Last night Izzy was
just staring at it.

1:00:37.703 --> 1:00:38.938
It was weird.

1:00:39.041 --> 1:00:41.244
It was like she was
hypnotized or somethin.

1:00:41.346 --> 1:00:42.910
- That symbol is weird.

1:00:43.012 --> 1:00:46.948
It looks like kinda Irish
or Celtic or something.

1:00:49.285 --> 1:00:50.083
- Hmm.

1:00:52.421 --> 1:00:53.387
- What else?

1:00:53.489 --> 1:00:54.854
- What else what?

1:00:54.956 --> 1:00:56.726
- You said she was
holding a music box?

1:00:56.828 --> 1:00:59.696
- Yeah, I found it in that
little cabinet over there.

1:00:59.798 --> 1:01:01.793
All the stuff is just
like stuff left behind.

1:01:01.895 --> 1:01:03.297
- From other renters or what?

1:01:03.399 --> 1:01:04.397
- I think so.

1:01:04.499 --> 1:01:05.333
I don't know.

1:01:05.435 --> 1:01:07.705
One second.

1:01:14.445 --> 1:01:16.472
- Look at these.

1:01:18.416 --> 1:01:19.717
This is the music box?

1:01:21.218 --> 1:01:22.485
- Yeah.

1:01:22.587 --> 1:01:24.616
- It's not making
any music sounds.

1:01:24.718 --> 1:01:26.053
- It was last night.

1:01:27.492 --> 1:01:29.419
I'm not crazy, it was, I swear.

1:01:31.290 --> 1:01:35.997
- To my dearest Karen,
always yours, L.M..

1:01:46.443 --> 1:01:47.503
- Hey, I'm Ian.

1:01:48.476 --> 1:01:49.505
- Hey.

1:01:51.075 --> 1:01:52.409
- How's your call back?

1:01:54.379 --> 1:01:56.947
- Sandy didn't even
show up, so I guess

1:01:57.049 --> 1:01:58.448
it kinda just went like that.

1:01:59.687 --> 1:02:00.483
- I'm sorry, hon.

1:02:01.519 --> 1:02:03.460
I'm sure it went better
than you think it did.

1:02:03.562 --> 1:02:05.691
And there's always
gonna be more.

1:02:05.793 --> 1:02:07.126
- There is gonna be more.

1:02:07.228 --> 1:02:10.197
I get another chance to
get rejected tomorrow.

1:02:10.299 --> 1:02:11.334
So.

1:02:11.436 --> 1:02:12.736
- My sister's an actress.

1:02:12.838 --> 1:02:15.432
They made her be the spoon
in "Beauty and the Beast."

1:02:16.471 --> 1:02:17.302
- Spoon.

1:02:18.441 --> 1:02:19.469
That's great.

1:02:23.214 --> 1:02:24.045
- Sorry.

1:02:31.115 --> 1:02:32.748
Why don't you cover that up?

1:02:32.850 --> 1:02:33.890
- I tried.

1:02:35.526 --> 1:02:36.521
- Smells kinda weird.

1:02:36.623 --> 1:02:37.959
- I know.

1:02:38.061 --> 1:02:41.392
And the necklace that
Izzy found was in ther.

1:02:42.563 --> 1:02:43.565
- What?

1:02:43.667 --> 1:02:45.803
Out of the hole?
- Yeah.

1:02:47.070 --> 1:02:49.499
She just reached her hand
in there and found it.

1:02:51.542 --> 1:02:53.775
- Okay, but that's gross.

1:02:53.877 --> 1:02:56.011
Does Izzy eat gum
off the sidewalk too?

1:02:57.314 --> 1:02:58.145
- Shut up.

1:02:59.080 --> 1:03:01.549
No, no, really,
that's fucking crazy.

1:03:01.651 --> 1:03:03.419
Why would that be in there?

1:03:03.521 --> 1:03:04.580
Why would you wear it?

1:03:06.686 --> 1:03:07.552
Okay.

1:03:07.654 --> 1:03:08.454
Moving on.

1:03:08.556 --> 1:03:09.991
All right.

1:03:10.093 --> 1:03:12.725
I'll look into anything
I can find on the window.

1:03:12.827 --> 1:03:14.659
You look into the apartment.

1:03:33.752 --> 1:03:35.517
Okay, this is definitey
a Celtic mark,

1:03:35.619 --> 1:03:36.552
it's called a triskele.

1:03:36.654 --> 1:03:38.856
It's like a druid pagan symbol.

1:03:39.917 --> 1:03:40.957
- Hmm.

1:03:51.798 --> 1:03:53.101
Liam McNally.

1:03:55.571 --> 1:03:56.401
Look at this.

1:03:58.805 --> 1:03:59.906
It's Karen.

1:04:00.008 --> 1:04:02.244
It's the name from
the music box.

1:04:02.346 --> 1:04:03.177
- L.M..

1:04:03.876 --> 1:04:04.943
That's crazy.

1:04:05.045 --> 1:04:06.811
That's their music box, right?

1:04:06.913 --> 1:04:07.951
- It has to be.

1:04:15.293 --> 1:04:16.124
- Damn.

1:04:17.329 --> 1:04:18.159
Look at this.

1:04:21.064 --> 1:04:23.593
- "Bank manager
murders pregnant wife."

1:04:25.402 --> 1:04:26.365
Jesus.

1:04:30.067 --> 1:04:31.436
Milton Briggs.

1:04:47.058 --> 1:04:51.027
"He was last known to
be in his apartment..."

1:04:51.790 --> 1:04:52.622
203.

1:04:58.803 --> 1:05:00.664
They all lived in
this apartment?

1:05:01.567 --> 1:05:04.337
- I don't know, some of
the articles don't say.

1:07:21.976 --> 1:07:23.677
- What happened?

1:07:23.779 --> 1:07:25.312
Are you okay?

1:07:25.414 --> 1:07:27.077
- There was this bird,
there was a fucking bid

1:07:27.179 --> 1:07:28.550
and it flew at me.

1:07:33.187 --> 1:07:35.457
- It's just a dream, all right?

1:07:35.559 --> 1:07:36.390
It's okay.

1:07:59.148 --> 1:08:00.150
- Can I help you with some?

1:08:01.520 --> 1:08:02.449
- Excuse me.

1:08:04.755 --> 1:08:06.123
Are you Kim White?

1:08:07.857 --> 1:08:08.755
- I'm her roommate.

1:08:08.857 --> 1:08:09.687
- Okay, great.

1:08:10.388 --> 1:08:11.788
Here.
- Thank you.

1:08:19.866 --> 1:08:20.896
Kim?

1:08:23.709 --> 1:08:25.373
Kim, I got your paper.

1:08:31.780 --> 1:08:32.611
Oh, fuck.

1:09:19.592 --> 1:09:21.792
- I'm just here in
St. Mark's Cathedral.

1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:25.464
As a lifelong atheist, I
don't have much experience

1:09:25.566 --> 1:09:28.697
with stained glass
windows, so I wanted to see

1:09:28.799 --> 1:09:31.337
these in person,
make some comparisons

1:09:31.439 --> 1:09:32.669
between the windows
in the church

1:09:32.772 --> 1:09:34.304
and the stained glass
window in Kim's apartment

1:09:34.406 --> 1:09:35.839
at the commerce building.

1:09:37.744 --> 1:09:41.284
So far, what I'm seeing
here are depictions

1:09:41.386 --> 1:09:45.585
of religious events, you know,
probably biblical symbolism.

1:09:47.354 --> 1:09:49.051
Or they're totally decorative.

1:09:49.854 --> 1:09:52.723
Either way, the tone
is about reverence.

1:09:52.825 --> 1:09:56.497
They're generally uplifting,
and generally pretty.

1:09:58.334 --> 1:10:00.598
In contrast to the
window in room 203,

1:10:00.700 --> 1:10:04.906
I don't see any maker's
marks or symbols

1:10:05.008 --> 1:10:06.606
that appear to be Celtic.

1:11:51.177 --> 1:11:51.913
- Hi.

1:11:52.015 --> 1:11:53.011
Can I help you?

1:11:53.113 --> 1:11:53.982
- Hi.

1:11:54.084 --> 1:11:55.745
Are, are you Milton Briggs?

1:11:55.847 --> 1:11:59.783
- When I can remember
my own name I am.

1:11:59.885 --> 1:12:02.551
Did I forget to pay
a bill or something?

1:12:02.653 --> 1:12:04.658
- No, no, nothing like that.

1:12:05.660 --> 1:12:07.859
I go to college here
and I'm actually doing

1:12:07.961 --> 1:12:10.595
some research for an article,
and I was just wondering

1:12:10.697 --> 1:12:12.094
if I could talk to
you for five minutes

1:12:12.196 --> 1:12:17.033
about Liam and Karen McNally
and the night that they died.

1:12:18.443 --> 1:12:20.509
- Why would you want to
write an article about that?

1:12:21.645 --> 1:12:24.773
They've already wrote everything
there is to say already.

1:12:24.875 --> 1:12:28.077
- I just wanted to
hear it from you.

1:12:30.720 --> 1:12:34.487
- I haven't had to talk
about that in about 50 years.

1:12:34.589 --> 1:12:36.087
I don't want to
dredge up the past.

1:12:36.189 --> 1:12:37.826
- Please.

1:12:37.928 --> 1:12:38.989
Five minutes.

1:12:40.092 --> 1:12:45.099
I live in that same apartment,
and I just need to know.

1:12:45.201 --> 1:12:46.601
- You live in room 203.

1:12:49.202 --> 1:12:50.033
- Yes.

1:12:52.938 --> 1:12:55.170
- That night I was
working the graveyard,

1:12:56.113 --> 1:12:58.008
and I heard some footsteps.

1:13:00.682 --> 1:13:03.880
I figured it was Larry,
the other janitor,

1:13:03.983 --> 1:13:07.356
had come back 'cause
he had forgot his keys,

1:13:07.459 --> 1:13:11.789
but then I heard more
footsteps, and crying.

1:13:11.892 --> 1:13:14.728
So I stepped out to
see what was happening.

1:13:15.693 --> 1:13:17.192
And that's when I saw him.

1:13:19.337 --> 1:13:21.504
Chasing his wife
into the boiler room.

1:13:23.137 --> 1:13:24.166
- Who?

1:13:26.603 --> 1:13:28.272
- Mr. McNally.

1:13:30.147 --> 1:13:31.514
He was after his wife.

1:13:33.480 --> 1:13:34.914
And she was screaming.

1:13:35.917 --> 1:13:40.815
So I ran after them and chased
them into the boiler room,

1:13:40.951 --> 1:13:43.724
and that's when I saw the .

1:13:45.623 --> 1:13:46.661
- Blood on who?

1:13:51.431 --> 1:13:52.699
- Mrs. McNally.

1:13:52.801 --> 1:13:57.507
She was clutching her
stomach and crying out.

1:13:59.637 --> 1:14:01.005
It was everywhere.

1:14:02.344 --> 1:14:04.140
And then the crying stopped.

1:14:08.118 --> 1:14:09.178
And I just froze.

1:14:10.588 --> 1:14:14.018
I've never been so ashamed
of anything in my life.

1:14:18.824 --> 1:14:22.230
I stood there, and
when he got up,

1:14:22.332 --> 1:14:25.194
he just walked right past me.

1:14:26.835 --> 1:14:29.902
He had a look in his eyes
I'd never seen in a man.

1:14:34.510 --> 1:14:37.272
It was like I wasn't even .

1:14:38.280 --> 1:14:39.912
Like I was a ghost.

1:14:40.814 --> 1:14:43.813
I felt like I
floated Mrs. McNally.

1:14:43.915 --> 1:14:45.815
I just wanted to
stop the bleeding.

1:14:45.917 --> 1:14:48.217
All of a sudden,
I heard a gunshot.

1:14:49.324 --> 1:14:50.219
- He shot himself?

1:14:52.556 --> 1:14:53.728
- I guess.

1:14:54.761 --> 1:14:56.995
I couldn't think
of what that was.

1:14:58.469 --> 1:15:01.031
My mind just wasn't
ready for it yet.

1:15:01.133 --> 1:15:04.574
At that point, all I could
hear was the baby crying.

1:15:05.338 --> 1:15:06.239
- What?

1:15:06.341 --> 1:15:07.643
The baby survived?

1:15:09.342 --> 1:15:10.173
- He did.

1:15:11.180 --> 1:15:12.109
A little boy.

1:15:13.316 --> 1:15:14.683
- What happened to him?

1:15:17.352 --> 1:15:18.313
- Nobody told me.

1:15:20.388 --> 1:15:21.657
I went into shock.

1:15:25.729 --> 1:15:29.566
And I've never stepped foot
in that building again.

1:15:55.223 --> 1:15:56.054
- Hey.

1:16:01.263 --> 1:16:02.324
- Hey Kimmy.

1:16:04.334 --> 1:16:05.635
- Where are you going?

1:16:06.597 --> 1:16:07.637
- Out.

1:16:08.837 --> 1:16:09.798
- Can you stay for a
few minutes, please?

1:16:09.900 --> 1:16:11.201
I need to talk to you.

1:16:12.342 --> 1:16:13.335
- I've got plans, kid.

1:16:14.473 --> 1:16:15.304
- Izzy...

1:16:18.414 --> 1:16:19.847
- Wanna talk about thi?

1:16:28.459 --> 1:16:31.023
This whole fucking
thing is about me.

1:16:34.999 --> 1:16:36.061
My life.

1:16:38.500 --> 1:16:39.767
- Izzy, I'm sorry, oka?

1:16:39.869 --> 1:16:42.270
I didn't say your name
and I kept it anonymou.

1:16:42.372 --> 1:16:43.599
I was just trying to help.

1:16:43.701 --> 1:16:45.204
- Help who?

1:16:45.306 --> 1:16:46.041
Yourself.

1:16:46.143 --> 1:16:47.105
- No, no...

1:16:48.212 --> 1:16:49.345
I was trying to-

1:16:49.447 --> 1:16:51.241
- You didn't have
to say my name.

1:16:52.814 --> 1:16:54.915
It's obvious who
you're talking about.

1:16:58.516 --> 1:17:02.989
You took my tragedy, ripped it
open, and put it on the page.

1:17:04.426 --> 1:17:05.858
Congratulations.

1:17:05.961 --> 1:17:07.327
You made me your guinea
pig just so you can

1:17:07.429 --> 1:17:08.862
get a fuckin' A?

1:17:08.964 --> 1:17:12.631
- No, please, Izzy, don't,
it wasn't like that, okay?

1:17:12.733 --> 1:17:13.929
I need you to listen to me now

1:17:14.031 --> 1:17:15.170
because it's really important.

1:17:15.272 --> 1:17:17.102
- Like I needed you.

1:17:21.674 --> 1:17:23.740
I buried my mom.

1:17:23.842 --> 1:17:25.407
Where the fuck were yo?

1:17:29.418 --> 1:17:30.384
- Izzy, I'm sorry.

1:17:30.486 --> 1:17:32.650
- No.
- No, I am sorry!

1:17:32.752 --> 1:17:35.021
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

1:17:37.287 --> 1:17:38.956
If you were there,
you wouldn't have had

1:17:39.058 --> 1:17:41.395
to write this fucking
paper just to make

1:17:41.497 --> 1:17:43.260
yourself feel better.

1:17:45.261 --> 1:17:46.764
I mean, did you
even ask yourself

1:17:46.866 --> 1:17:49.200
why I was so fucked up after?

1:17:50.937 --> 1:17:53.108
Bro, you were the
only family left.

1:17:53.210 --> 1:17:54.436
And you left.

1:17:55.807 --> 1:17:57.842
- Izzy, I'm sorry.

1:17:57.944 --> 1:18:00.043
I am, I'm sorry,
Izzy, please stay.

1:18:00.145 --> 1:18:02.719
- I just wanted you
to fight for me.

1:18:03.815 --> 1:18:05.615
- Izzy, please.

1:18:27.775 --> 1:18:30.178
- Druids worshiped Pagan gods.

1:18:37.918 --> 1:18:41.516
"Goddess of revenge, war, .

1:18:42.590 --> 1:18:44.156
Known as 'fury.'"

1:18:48.565 --> 1:18:50.393
Often takes the form of a crow.

1:19:08.419 --> 1:19:10.248
The mark of the Morrig.

1:20:03.635 --> 1:20:04.906
Kim.

1:20:05.008 --> 1:20:06.236
Okay, just the facts,
and the facts are weir.

1:20:06.339 --> 1:20:07.639
I found something on
the stained glass windw

1:20:07.741 --> 1:20:08.607
in your apartment.

1:20:08.709 --> 1:20:09.575
I was researching...

1:20:09.677 --> 1:20:11.012
Anyway, whatever.

1:20:11.114 --> 1:20:12.913
I just need to tell you
about it as soon as possible.

1:20:13.016 --> 1:20:14.547
And maybe you shouldn't
be there right now.

1:20:14.649 --> 1:20:15.513
If you are there.

1:20:15.615 --> 1:20:16.718
Okay.

1:20:16.820 --> 1:20:17.946
Call me back as soon
as you get this.

1:20:18.048 --> 1:20:18.782
I'm coming over.

1:20:57.995 --> 1:21:02.162
- That was the last picture
taken of my parents.

1:21:09.738 --> 1:21:11.006
Do you recognize anything?

1:21:19.847 --> 1:21:21.445
My mother's necklace.

1:21:24.755 --> 1:21:27.385
Morrigu chooses
who wears it next.

1:21:32.661 --> 1:21:33.996
She's with her now.

1:21:37.029 --> 1:21:38.894
And she needs to feed.

1:21:42.407 --> 1:21:43.698
feed her children.

1:21:49.406 --> 1:21:52.443
If I don't satisfy
the crows soon,

1:21:54.146 --> 1:21:56.678
she's going to come after me.

1:21:59.054 --> 1:22:02.189
Like she did my
mother and my father.

1:22:10.427 --> 1:22:14.399
Normally, it would
be done by now.

1:22:18.676 --> 1:22:21.043
But your friend is fighting it.

1:22:22.778 --> 1:22:24.211
The others were quicke.

1:22:27.750 --> 1:22:29.986
I'm telling you this...

1:22:34.289 --> 1:22:36.986
Because you're about to
join them in the walls.

1:23:07.985 --> 1:23:08.783
- Hello?

1:23:14.859 --> 1:23:15.691
Kim?

1:23:19.535 --> 1:23:20.269
Shit!

1:23:20.371 --> 1:23:21.202
Oh, shit.

1:23:46.893 --> 1:23:48.328
Izzy, Jesus.

1:23:52.195 --> 1:23:53.465
- Ian, right?

1:23:55.637 --> 1:23:56.468
- Yeah.

1:23:57.200 --> 1:23:58.035
Is Kim here?

1:23:58.137 --> 1:23:59.405
Do you know where she is?

1:24:00.171 --> 1:24:01.242
- She'll be back.

1:24:02.746 --> 1:24:04.839
For now you can sit here...

1:24:07.077 --> 1:24:08.117
And wait.

1:24:09.618 --> 1:24:10.946
- Kim's...

1:24:11.048 --> 1:24:11.751
- Shh.

1:24:30.741 --> 1:24:31.837
- I don't have a choic!

1:24:33.408 --> 1:24:36.612
Morrigu has been trapped
in the glass for centuries.

1:24:36.714 --> 1:24:38.543
She's a part of my family.

1:24:44.920 --> 1:24:47.453
I found my father's journal.

1:24:54.062 --> 1:24:56.830
He taught me about the curse.

1:24:56.932 --> 1:24:59.462
He taught me how she feeds.

1:24:59.564 --> 1:25:02.567
How the souls she
takes leave a totem

1:25:03.469 --> 1:25:06.505
and allow her to
cross into our realm.

1:25:08.474 --> 1:25:11.375
My parents thought
they could ignore it,

1:25:11.477 --> 1:25:13.875
and she found a
way to get to them.

1:25:16.115 --> 1:25:17.648
She won't get to me.

1:25:40.711 --> 1:25:42.776
Take this offering.

1:25:46.750 --> 1:25:48.316
Feed on her soul.

1:26:06.968 --> 1:26:08.230
You little bitch!

1:26:16.943 --> 1:26:17.712
- Izzy?

1:26:17.814 --> 1:26:18.947
Izzy, where are you?

1:26:19.049 --> 1:26:21.778
We need to leave,
we need to go now!

1:26:57.921 --> 1:26:59.849
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:27:07.158 --> 1:27:07.989
I'm sorry.

1:28:39.822 --> 1:28:40.653
- Kim.

1:28:45.124 --> 1:28:46.728
Kimmy?

1:28:54.070 --> 1:28:56.372
You can't save her now.

1:30:34.068 --> 1:30:34.899
- Izzy?

1:30:42.505 --> 1:30:43.545
It's me.

1:30:48.984 --> 1:30:50.246
Please.

1:30:50.348 --> 1:30:51.179
It's Kim.

1:31:19.916 --> 1:31:20.576
Please.

1:31:20.678 --> 1:31:21.984
Just let me save her, okay?

1:31:22.086 --> 1:31:23.519
Just let me save Izzy.

1:31:30.324 --> 1:31:31.219
I'll go with you.

1:31:37.001 --> 1:31:37.524
Just please, okay?

1:31:37.626 --> 1:31:38.666
I saw him.

1:31:39.433 --> 1:31:41.735
I saw your father's face.

1:31:44.438 --> 1:31:46.674
- That means she's her.

1:31:49.440 --> 1:31:50.271
It's time.

1:31:53.246 --> 1:31:54.077
- Don't.

1:31:55.811 --> 1:31:58.018
Don't do it, just...

1:31:58.120 --> 1:31:58.917
Don't do it.

1:32:00.157 --> 1:32:01.920
- It's my responsibility.

1:33:24.535 --> 1:33:25.366
- Izzy?

1:33:30.244 --> 1:33:31.075
Izzy?

1:33:36.448 --> 1:33:37.279
Izzy?

1:33:49.628 --> 1:33:50.897
- Help me, Kim.

1:33:52.597 --> 1:33:53.735
I need you.

1:33:55.338 --> 1:33:56.430
- That's why I'm here.

1:33:58.473 --> 1:33:59.939
I'm gonna help you, okay?

1:34:03.142 --> 1:34:05.879
I just need you to take
off the necklace, okay?

1:34:13.422 --> 1:34:14.822
Take the necklace off, Izzy.

1:34:22.530 --> 1:34:23.897
- Can you get me home?

1:34:26.135 --> 1:34:26.966
Please.

1:34:28.931 --> 1:34:30.101
- I love you, Izzy.

1:34:33.476 --> 1:34:34.602
I won't let her have you, okay?

1:34:34.704 --> 1:34:36.308
I won't.

1:34:48.589 --> 1:34:50.957
- Help me, please help me.

1:34:59.069 --> 1:34:59.900
Help me.

1:35:07.242 --> 1:35:08.073
Kimmy.

1:35:10.180 --> 1:35:11.109
I need you.

1:35:17.684 --> 1:35:19.986
- Take the necklace of.

1:36:04.467 --> 1:36:05.760
Izzy, I won't let you go.

1:36:05.862 --> 1:36:07.165
- She's mine.

1:36:07.899 --> 1:36:09.433
- Izzy, don't leave me.

1:36:09.535 --> 1:36:10.564
Izzy.

1:36:23.880 --> 1:36:25.084
Don't leave.

1:36:25.818 --> 1:36:27.882
I love you, Izzy, okay?

1:36:28.985 --> 1:36:30.524
Please, I love you.

1:36:30.626 --> 1:36:32.190
- Are you okay?
- Fuck.

1:36:33.594 --> 1:36:35.428
It's okay, I'm okay.

1:36:35.530 --> 1:36:37.828
I'm okay.

1:36:37.931 --> 1:36:39.628
- Let's get the fuck outta.

1:36:39.730 --> 1:36:41.069
- No.

1:36:41.171 --> 1:36:42.002
Not yet.

1:36:43.004 --> 1:36:45.907
Not until we destroy
that fucking window.

1:38:19.736 --> 1:38:22.132
Fuck, Kimmy, just
do it and leave!

1:38:22.234 --> 1:38:25.636
Come on, Kimmy, just
do it and leave!

1:38:25.738 --> 1:38:27.001
Kimmy, please.

1:38:38.354 --> 1:38:39.682
It's okay.

1:38:39.784 --> 1:38:40.717
Come on.

1:38:40.819 --> 1:38:42.323
We gotta go.

1:39:15.586 --> 1:39:18.257
- When you're one
of those left behind,

1:39:19.491 --> 1:39:21.997
you understand that the
shadow will always exist.

1:39:25.465 --> 1:39:28.630
There's no doomsday clock
ticking away your countdown.

1:39:31.108 --> 1:39:34.207
It's more of an appreciation
for every single morning.

1:39:36.277 --> 1:39:38.673
That's why I'm grateful
to be here with her.

1:39:39.575 --> 1:39:42.347
She appreciates me
simply for existing.

1:39:44.614 --> 1:39:47.517
She loves me because
I fight alongside her.

1:39:49.190 --> 1:39:51.521
If the shadow wants
to knock on this door,

1:39:54.026 --> 1:39:55.558
it'll have to take us both.
