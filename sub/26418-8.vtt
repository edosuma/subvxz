WEBVTT

00:01.044 --> 00:03.090
Previously on Van Helsing...

00:03.133 --> 00:06.354
Ever since the elder bit me,
I'm craving it.

00:08.356 --> 00:13.230
If I start to turn, you know
what you have to do, right?

00:13.274 --> 00:14.710
The family book.

00:14.753 --> 00:18.714
The answers are in there,
I just couldn't find them.

00:18.757 --> 00:20.759
I read every word.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.022
I'll miss you.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.414
Bring her back in one piece.

00:23.458 --> 00:25.764
Yeah, not a scratch.

00:25.808 --> 00:28.724
Each elder has something,
a totem,

00:28.767 --> 00:30.726
that leads to the dark one.

00:30.769 --> 00:33.163
We kill the elders,
take their totems,

00:33.207 --> 00:35.557
and resurrect the dark one
ourselves.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.907
We end this once and for all.

00:47.917 --> 00:50.441
[owl hooting]

00:54.793 --> 00:57.622
What's that line thing?

00:57.666 --> 01:01.670
I don't know, it looks like
a maze or something.

01:01.713 --> 01:04.934
What're we even looking for?

01:04.977 --> 01:06.196
I don't know.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.806
It's not in the words, right?

01:07.850 --> 01:10.592
We're supposed to be looking
for hidden clues or something?

01:10.635 --> 01:12.942
Yeah, that's what she said,
right?

01:37.880 --> 01:39.316
Anything?

01:40.056 --> 01:41.449
No.

01:42.667 --> 01:45.453
Don't worry,
we'll figure it out.

01:45.496 --> 01:49.979
Yeah, I just hope in time enough
to make a difference.

01:54.549 --> 01:55.463
[snap]

01:55.506 --> 01:57.073
Head down, now!

01:59.554 --> 02:07.562
[fighting grunts]

02:17.746 --> 02:19.313
[gun shot]

02:38.854 --> 02:40.377
Holy shit.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.029
Hey!

03:27.207 --> 03:28.425
Hey!

03:28.991 --> 03:31.385
Hey! That's my boat!

03:31.428 --> 03:32.951
[gun shot]

03:32.995 --> 03:33.778
[gun shot]

03:33.822 --> 03:36.216
[groans]

03:36.259 --> 03:37.782
You ok?

03:37.826 --> 03:39.567
Yeah, I'm great.

03:39.610 --> 03:43.266
I just got shot in the back
with a shotgun.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.106
Good thing we walked
all over those mountains

04:41.150 --> 04:44.414
instead of just taking
the boat here.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.156
According to the map
we should be close.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.985
Yeah, assuming that we've
been following the right map.

04:50.028 --> 04:52.161
What're we even looking for?

04:54.685 --> 04:57.166
Ugh.

04:57.209 --> 04:59.211
That, maybe.

05:38.599 --> 05:41.906
[flies buzzing]

05:47.347 --> 05:48.652
Anything else in there?

05:48.696 --> 05:51.263
You mean, besides a dead guy
without a face

05:51.307 --> 05:53.570
'cause he blew it off?

05:53.614 --> 05:55.833
I'm assuming it's not the elder.

05:55.877 --> 05:59.663
No, he looks human.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.970
Looks like it's this guy
right here.

06:02.013 --> 06:04.451
Chuck Tanner.

06:04.494 --> 06:07.802
I think he was the keeper here
when all this started so...

06:07.845 --> 06:09.412
If I was on this island
for two weeks

06:09.456 --> 06:11.458
I'd probably do the same thing.

06:13.677 --> 06:17.072
Man, there's a lot
of good shit in here.

06:17.115 --> 06:20.118
I feel like this place hasn't
been touched since the rising.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.207
Yeah, it does seem that way.

06:26.777 --> 06:28.126
Woah.

06:31.478 --> 06:35.264
Hey, I'm starving.

06:35.307 --> 06:36.874
Let's eat.

06:38.223 --> 06:39.660
Somewhere else?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.098
Yeah.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.451
When you were alone with mom
did she say anything else

06:48.495 --> 06:50.801
about being a Van Helsing?

06:50.845 --> 06:52.803
Our childhoods?

06:52.847 --> 06:54.631
Why the hell we're stuck
doing this?

06:54.675 --> 06:57.155
Only what you already know.

06:57.199 --> 07:00.158
About being willing to make
sacrifices and stuff

07:00.202 --> 07:02.422
about our destiny.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.249
And the necklace, I guess,
with blood in it.

07:04.293 --> 07:06.164
Anything about what we're
supposed to do with it?

07:06.208 --> 07:07.905
No.

07:07.949 --> 07:09.516
That's why I gave a bit
of it to Doc,

07:09.559 --> 07:12.693
see if she could make
some use of it.

07:12.736 --> 07:16.305
Sorry, I wish I had better
answers.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.791
Maybe we got it wrong.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.401
Maybe we're on the wrong island.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.316
Maybe.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.189
Or not.

07:32.408 --> 07:33.627
I've seen this.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.324
Inside there.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.938
What the hell is that?

07:40.982 --> 07:43.375
Old. That's what it is.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.814
Give me a hand.

07:48.293 --> 07:49.120
Put it on the back table?

07:49.164 --> 07:50.470
Yeah.

07:52.297 --> 07:53.516
Got it.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.300
Woah, careful.

08:01.219 --> 08:02.699
Right here.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.320
It's cool.

08:15.364 --> 08:17.061
I have no idea what
to do with this.

08:17.105 --> 08:18.802
I'll get the book.

08:28.464 --> 08:29.421
There's a wick.

08:29.465 --> 08:32.120
Still some kerosene left.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.425
What does it say in there?

08:33.469 --> 08:35.645
I don't know, I can't understand
the language.

08:35.689 --> 08:37.821
Oh, my god, why is everything
in riddles?

08:37.865 --> 08:40.868
Just once can we have something
in plain English?

08:40.911 --> 08:42.391
What fun would that be?

08:42.434 --> 08:44.828
A lot, actually.

08:46.830 --> 08:49.616
It's like a- a light
of some kind, you know?

08:49.659 --> 08:51.226
A lantern or...

08:55.491 --> 08:56.971
Bingo.

08:58.799 --> 09:01.018
Let's see if we can light it up.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.846
Find some matches?

09:03.673 --> 09:05.545
Uh...

09:07.808 --> 09:09.940
Ah. Great.

09:26.174 --> 09:29.133
See if there's, like, slides
around here or something.

09:35.270 --> 09:36.967
Wait.

09:37.011 --> 09:40.318
I thought I saw something
in here.

09:40.362 --> 09:41.755
There's nothing back here.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.583
Nothing over here, either.

09:49.763 --> 09:57.553
There's a bunch of old maps, but
I don't know how that's helpful.

09:57.597 --> 10:01.426
This is a map of the island
as it is today.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.037
It wouldn't go with
this machine.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.299
Mmmhmm.

10:04.342 --> 10:06.606
We need to use this map.

10:20.837 --> 10:24.188
It's almost as if we need
to project this.

10:27.191 --> 10:28.366
I mean, is there any way
that we-

10:28.410 --> 10:29.193
Vanessa.

10:29.237 --> 10:30.325
Yeah?

10:32.893 --> 10:34.285
Exactly.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.390
Ok.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.263
See that?

11:03.401 --> 11:04.576
See this line?

11:04.620 --> 11:05.882
Mmmhmm.

11:05.926 --> 11:07.971
It's only on this map.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.712
It matches up with this one.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.192
Does it intersect on the island?

11:11.235 --> 11:12.323
Sure does.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.195
This is the lighthouse.

11:14.238 --> 11:15.979
It's... it's like a beach away.

11:16.023 --> 11:18.068
Let's go check it out.

11:19.853 --> 11:21.637
Hey, woah, woah, woah.
Hold up.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.900
Come here. Give me the totems.

11:23.944 --> 11:25.467
What? Why?

11:25.510 --> 11:28.035
If we do run into an elder
we don't wanna have the totems

11:28.078 --> 11:31.255
and then it opens up
a passageway to hell
or something-

11:31.299 --> 11:32.953
Yeah, no, it's a good idea.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.433
Let's leave them here.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.663
Alright, let's go.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.122
Ok.

12:12.166 --> 12:15.560
Well, it looks like the map
wasn't wrong.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.562
It's something.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.043
Oh, shit.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.392
What?

12:21.436 --> 12:23.481
I've seen these before,

12:23.525 --> 12:27.485
in the cavern
with the first elder.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.661
This is gonna suck.

12:31.011 --> 12:32.621
Here.

12:33.404 --> 12:34.841
Whew!

12:40.672 --> 12:41.848
[groans]

12:44.894 --> 12:46.156
What the hell was that?

12:46.200 --> 12:48.332
Our only way in.

12:48.376 --> 12:49.377
You ok?

12:49.420 --> 12:51.901
Yep.

12:51.945 --> 12:54.077
Go ahead.

13:09.179 --> 13:10.485
Ugh.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.009
Shit.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.103
What the hell is that?

13:22.671 --> 13:29.199
So, the time has arrived.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.810
Come.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.857
Come. Don't be silent,
my dears.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.860
What would this world be
if we cannot speak freely

13:37.904 --> 13:40.036
to one another?

13:40.080 --> 13:41.777
No one's stopping you.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.387
Just keep speaking.

13:43.431 --> 13:47.914
Surely you are Van Helsings,
too.

13:47.957 --> 13:50.177
You must be.

13:50.220 --> 13:55.835
I can practically smell it
on you.

13:55.878 --> 13:58.968
And your likeness.

13:59.012 --> 14:04.234
This was not a coincidence.

14:04.278 --> 14:09.239
I knew this day was coming.

14:09.283 --> 14:11.024
You're a Van Helsing?

14:11.067 --> 14:13.765
Indeed.

14:13.809 --> 14:20.381
Jacob Van Helsing,
brother of the greatest of all,

14:20.424 --> 14:22.818
Abraham.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.516
But you're an elder.

14:25.560 --> 14:31.566
Oh, this is also true.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.742
Well, if that's the case then
you know why we're here.

14:33.785 --> 14:36.745
To kill me, I imagine.

14:36.788 --> 14:39.574
Yeah, that's a really
great guess.

14:39.617 --> 14:42.707
But that, my darling,
would be-

14:42.751 --> 14:47.669
[groans]

14:51.586 --> 14:55.807
What are your names,
if I may ask?

14:55.851 --> 14:57.244
Scarlett.

14:57.287 --> 14:58.288
Scarlett.

14:58.332 --> 14:59.768
That's Vanessa.

14:59.811 --> 15:01.813
Vanessa.

15:01.857 --> 15:09.038
Of course, the same as your
great-great-great-grandmother.

15:09.082 --> 15:13.390
Vanessa...

15:13.434 --> 15:18.091
It would be a grave mistake to
be done with me this quickly.

15:18.134 --> 15:22.225
There is much for you to learn
from the likes of me.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.358
We're just here to get
the totem.

15:24.401 --> 15:25.968
The rest is up to you.

15:26.012 --> 15:29.667
Oh, you mean life or death
is up to me to choose?

15:29.711 --> 15:31.234
No.

15:31.278 --> 15:36.022
More like how you die and what
you decide to tell us

15:36.065 --> 15:38.154
before that happens.

15:39.677 --> 15:41.244
So what happened to you?

15:41.288 --> 15:42.898
You were turned by someone?

15:42.942 --> 15:45.118
Of course.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.947
The darkness itself.

15:47.990 --> 15:51.037
Abraham and I chased the son
of the jackal across Europe

15:51.080 --> 15:57.826
to England and then finally here
to the new world.

15:57.869 --> 16:01.264
I was wounded during the final
battle with that wretched soul

16:01.308 --> 16:04.659
outside the labyrinth
while it and Abraham tumbled

16:04.702 --> 16:07.183
through the portal
and beyond,

16:07.227 --> 16:12.232
which I am sure they still
remain in 'til this day.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.495
What labyrinth?

16:14.538 --> 16:15.496
Where?

16:15.539 --> 16:17.367
Oh, you know.

16:17.411 --> 16:22.764
Below the madness.

16:22.807 --> 16:26.768
Protected by the consumers
of light.

16:26.811 --> 16:29.901
What about the fourth elder?

16:29.945 --> 16:32.295
Did you ever face it?

16:32.339 --> 16:35.037
Just once.

16:35.081 --> 16:37.909
And the portal, you know
where it is, exactly?

16:37.953 --> 16:39.433
Of course.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.522
So do you.

16:41.565 --> 16:45.221
But now it is your journey
to take.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.136
Yes.

16:52.141 --> 16:54.361
Or yours.

16:55.492 --> 16:58.452
Ok, so you were bitten,
and then what?

16:58.495 --> 17:00.106
How did you become an elder?

17:00.149 --> 17:05.328
I was chosen to be the next.

17:05.372 --> 17:14.424
It seduced me
like a young maiden.

17:14.468 --> 17:18.037
I was happily resting
in the house of Renfield

17:18.080 --> 17:21.170
in my own mind.

17:21.214 --> 17:24.086
The pull was too strong.

17:24.130 --> 17:27.872
The seduction,

17:27.916 --> 17:29.265
the chance for eternity.

17:29.309 --> 17:31.833
I am so weak.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.052
I need blood.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.010
Do you have blood?

17:35.054 --> 17:37.273
I need...

17:37.317 --> 17:41.886
I'll give you blood,
but first you're gonna help us.

17:41.930 --> 17:42.583
Ok?

17:42.626 --> 17:43.758
Yes.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.064
Good.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.283
Where's the totem?

17:47.327 --> 17:48.676
First the totem, then blood.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.591
Very near.

17:50.634 --> 17:53.550
Uh, more specific than that?

17:53.594 --> 17:57.337
Very, very near.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.600
But know this.

17:59.643 --> 18:04.866
Only one of you will continue
to the end.

18:04.909 --> 18:05.823
One.

18:05.867 --> 18:06.998
Never both.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.783
No.

18:08.826 --> 18:13.353
And when the time is right
both of you will know

18:13.396 --> 18:19.924
what must happen, what your
destinies are intended to be.

18:22.971 --> 18:25.582
So where is it?

18:25.626 --> 18:28.194
Where is what?

18:28.237 --> 18:31.153
Don't play games.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.460
The totem.

18:33.503 --> 18:36.550
Ah.

18:36.593 --> 18:37.812
I told you.

18:37.855 --> 18:38.813
It's very near.

18:38.856 --> 18:39.727
Oh my god.

18:39.770 --> 18:41.294
Play time's over.

18:43.383 --> 18:44.732
Where is it?

18:44.775 --> 18:48.083
You already have it.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.867
There.

18:49.911 --> 18:51.521
Around your neck.

18:51.565 --> 18:57.048
That is my totem that was taken
from me when I was entombed.

18:57.092 --> 18:58.659
Mine.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.625
No, no, no.

19:08.669 --> 19:10.453
Wait, wait, wait.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.291
Yes.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.555
Oh, the sun.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.557
Nothing like the sun.

19:27.601 --> 19:33.302
It feels so long ago that
I felt its... its glow,

19:33.346 --> 19:35.217
its warmth, its...

19:35.261 --> 19:36.871
I can't tolerate this
my whole life

19:36.914 --> 19:40.440
but it does feel wonderful.

19:42.703 --> 19:45.358
Now, who'd have thought,
you and you,

19:45.401 --> 19:48.012
two twins would
join together to, what,

19:48.056 --> 19:50.406
save the world?

19:50.450 --> 19:52.843
[laughs]

19:52.887 --> 19:55.455
After the apocalypse
finally came

19:55.498 --> 19:58.980
as Abraham always predicted
it would be,

19:59.023 --> 20:02.505
the fate of this world

20:02.549 --> 20:09.033
rests on Van Helsing's shoulders
once again.

20:09.077 --> 20:11.558
Yes.

20:11.601 --> 20:16.084
And things are finally the way
they should be.

20:16.127 --> 20:18.217
Wouldn't you say?

20:18.260 --> 20:19.348
You.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.045
Yeah, enough about us.

20:21.089 --> 20:24.266
Look, I just want you to know
the stakes

20:24.310 --> 20:25.615
of what we're dealing with here

20:25.659 --> 20:29.097
and why it's so important
for you to help us.

20:29.140 --> 20:30.664
I do.

20:30.707 --> 20:32.622
I do, because I am you.

20:32.666 --> 20:33.971
I was you.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.321
I understand.

20:35.364 --> 20:36.800
Good.

20:36.844 --> 20:41.849
Then help us, and we'll-
we'll make this-

20:41.892 --> 20:43.590
You'll what?

20:43.633 --> 20:48.769
You will what, leave me here
alone on this island?

20:48.812 --> 20:51.598
You will put me back in
that cell in that chair?

20:51.641 --> 20:53.643
No.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.036
Uh-uh.

20:55.079 --> 20:57.386
No, I was gonna say make it
quick and painless.

20:58.822 --> 21:00.868
Look, Jacob, we can't
leave you here.

21:00.911 --> 21:03.914
And I'm sorry about that, but...

21:03.958 --> 21:06.352
the less elders the world
has to face the better.

21:06.395 --> 21:07.744
No, no, no, no.

21:07.788 --> 21:09.006
Listen to me.

21:09.050 --> 21:10.834
I can control it.

21:10.878 --> 21:14.229
The sickness, I can control it,
even if I don't want to I can-

21:14.273 --> 21:17.885
I learned how.

21:17.928 --> 21:20.279
Trust me.

21:22.063 --> 21:23.673
Sorry.

21:25.675 --> 21:28.591
Then change me back.

21:28.635 --> 21:31.202
Turn me back to a human.

21:31.246 --> 21:34.380
If what you're saying about
yourselves is true then why not?

21:34.423 --> 21:36.773
Why not turn me back?

21:36.817 --> 21:39.994
Make me a human again,
yes?

21:40.037 --> 21:41.169
Yes.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.344
Or at least try.

21:42.388 --> 21:45.216
I mean, I may turn to dust,

21:45.260 --> 21:47.349
and that will be as
our god above

21:47.393 --> 21:52.572
wishes it to be
but please just try,

21:52.615 --> 21:57.707
as a Van Helsing you must.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.627
Please.

22:09.023 --> 22:12.592
Do that, or feed me. Huh?

22:12.635 --> 22:14.985
At least feed me.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.857
Just feed me before I die.

22:16.900 --> 22:20.774
I must taste blood one more time
before I pass.

22:20.817 --> 22:21.862
Just one more time.

22:21.905 --> 22:23.559
Just one more time, please?

22:23.603 --> 22:25.692
I need to taste blood
one more time.

22:25.735 --> 22:28.390
You made me a promise,
remember?

22:28.434 --> 22:29.826
Vanessa.

22:32.916 --> 22:39.183
Look, I- I get that he's an
elder but he's also our family.

22:39.227 --> 22:42.361
Maybe we should try.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.537
That elder that bit me
at Black Tech,

22:44.580 --> 22:46.408
he didn't turn.

22:46.452 --> 22:47.975
I don't think it's gonna make
a difference.

22:48.018 --> 22:52.762
Ok, well, it might not change
him but at least we tried.

22:52.806 --> 22:54.503
What's the worst
that could happen?

22:54.547 --> 22:57.767
I know you haven't done it
very many times.

22:57.811 --> 23:02.076
Every time that I do it

23:02.119 --> 23:08.474
something inside, regardless of
the outcome, there's a cost.

23:08.517 --> 23:11.085
And I don't know
what that means.

23:12.565 --> 23:14.175
I'll try.

23:14.218 --> 23:14.915
No.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.133
Wait, you just said

23:16.177 --> 23:17.439
that I haven't really done
this very much.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.267
It may not hurt me.

23:19.310 --> 23:20.311
I don't know.

23:20.355 --> 23:22.313
It could make a difference
for him.

23:27.406 --> 23:31.148
No, we can't bite him.

23:31.192 --> 23:32.541
But we can feed him.

23:32.585 --> 23:34.413
Alright.

23:35.283 --> 23:36.284
You want blood?

23:36.327 --> 23:37.720
Yes, yes, I do.

23:37.764 --> 23:40.462
Come on.

23:51.952 --> 23:58.088
[sniffing]

24:04.660 --> 24:07.010
He can sense the totems.

24:07.054 --> 24:09.665
Hide them somewhere else.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.406
Meanwhile, I'll give him
some blood,

24:11.450 --> 24:13.582
buy us some time.

24:15.758 --> 24:18.892
So is this it then?

24:18.935 --> 24:21.721
The moment of truth.

24:21.764 --> 24:22.852
Who is going to be the one?

24:22.896 --> 24:24.114
You?

24:24.158 --> 24:26.377
Or you?

24:26.421 --> 24:28.510
Which one of you beautiful girls
is gonna be the angel

24:28.554 --> 24:29.859
of my death?

24:29.903 --> 24:30.512
Neither of us.

24:30.556 --> 24:31.339
No?

24:31.382 --> 24:32.688
We're not gonna bite you.

24:32.732 --> 24:36.779
But I will do as I promised you.

24:36.823 --> 24:37.867
I'm gonna give you blood.

24:37.911 --> 24:39.347
What?

24:39.390 --> 24:41.305
You?

24:41.349 --> 24:43.525
You can have some
and see what happens.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.658
Ok.

24:49.096 --> 24:53.927
Have you been nourishing
your need by your own means?

24:53.970 --> 24:56.146
I was.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.366
Before my turn.

25:01.195 --> 25:04.503
What do you know about that?

25:04.546 --> 25:07.201
Nothing.

25:07.244 --> 25:11.597
I am the same as you are now.

25:11.640 --> 25:18.560
Before I became an elder...
yes.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.606
You're getting closer,
my dear.

25:20.649 --> 25:22.521
Yes.

25:22.564 --> 25:26.437
Oh, ever close.

25:26.481 --> 25:28.483
Closer to what?

25:31.094 --> 25:32.748
The other side.

25:33.749 --> 25:34.576
Please.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.143
Shut up and drink.

25:36.186 --> 25:38.101
Yes.

26:02.691 --> 26:08.001
So sweet.

26:08.044 --> 26:12.745
So pure.

26:12.788 --> 26:17.576
But there's something else
that I feel as well.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.405
[inhales]

26:23.669 --> 26:25.845
Oh.

26:29.805 --> 26:36.943
There's the power of another
in your blood.

26:43.166 --> 26:46.039
You don't seem to be changing.

26:50.478 --> 26:52.741
What did you mean when you said
that only one of us will survive

26:52.785 --> 26:55.744
to the end?

26:55.788 --> 27:00.053
It was the same for Abraham
and me.

27:00.096 --> 27:03.578
It's the same for you
and your sister.

27:30.910 --> 27:36.089
You need this as much as I do.

27:40.136 --> 27:43.705
You don't know shit about me.

27:43.749 --> 27:46.708
If you're a Van Helsing
then this is your chance.

27:52.540 --> 27:54.150
Make a choice.

28:15.955 --> 28:16.825
Scarlett.

28:17.696 --> 28:18.958
Scarlett!

28:19.480 --> 28:20.655
I just turned around
and he's gone.

28:20.699 --> 28:21.395
What're you talking about?

28:21.438 --> 28:22.004
He's gone.

28:22.048 --> 28:23.310
Where...

28:26.530 --> 28:27.749
Shit.

28:27.793 --> 28:31.318
He could have gone anywhere.

28:31.361 --> 28:32.449
Alright, the quickest way
to hide

28:32.493 --> 28:33.363
is to go through those woods.

28:33.407 --> 28:34.234
We should go that way.

28:34.277 --> 28:35.365
I think we should split up.

28:35.409 --> 28:36.410
No, we need to stay together.

28:36.453 --> 28:37.716
We're a lot stronger that way.

28:37.759 --> 28:40.370
Yeah, but we'd cover more ground
if we split up.

28:40.414 --> 28:41.850
You go to the woods,

28:41.894 --> 28:43.460
I'll check down there real quick
and meet up with you.

28:43.504 --> 28:44.113
I think we're better off-

28:44.157 --> 28:45.898
Just trust me.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.379
Alright.

29:41.997 --> 29:43.390
Hey.

29:43.433 --> 29:44.783
Did you find him?

29:44.826 --> 29:47.873
No, I checked down there
but there was nothing.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.005
Alright.

29:50.049 --> 29:52.834
Well, we'll just keep looking
I guess.

29:55.097 --> 29:57.012
No, no, no, no, Scarlett.

29:57.056 --> 29:58.840
I'm not the one to fear.

29:58.884 --> 29:59.885
Where's Vanessa?

29:59.928 --> 30:02.148
Vanessa?

30:02.191 --> 30:05.716
Oh, you think she's
the stronger one.

30:05.760 --> 30:10.243
But I sense a far greater
strength in you.

30:10.286 --> 30:11.548
What are you talking about?

30:11.592 --> 30:15.857
History repeating itself
over and over again

30:15.901 --> 30:18.599
like it did for me
and my brother.

30:18.642 --> 30:23.778
Like it will for others
of our kind after us.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.215
One stronger than the other.

30:26.259 --> 30:27.477
I guess we know which one
you are,

30:27.521 --> 30:29.610
since you were seduced
by the darkness.

30:29.653 --> 30:31.351
Is that what you believe?

30:31.394 --> 30:33.048
That's what you told us
in the cell.

30:33.092 --> 30:36.660
I would have told you anything
to get out of that cell.

30:36.704 --> 30:38.837
The pull was so strong,

30:38.880 --> 30:42.318
I was seduced,
oh, I was so weak.

30:42.362 --> 30:43.842
Look what you've become.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.278
What have I become?

30:45.321 --> 30:46.888
You know nothing.

30:46.932 --> 30:51.893
You think because you see me
like this you know the truth.

30:51.937 --> 30:56.289
You are so naive.

30:56.332 --> 30:58.857
Then set me straight.

31:04.645 --> 31:07.343
Like you and your sister,

31:07.387 --> 31:11.130
me and my brother
were of one mind.

31:11.173 --> 31:14.960
End the tyranny of the vampire.

31:15.003 --> 31:19.094
Destroy the dark one, yes?

31:19.138 --> 31:22.097
If only it was that simple.

31:22.141 --> 31:25.927
Our destiny lead us down a path
very much like the one

31:25.971 --> 31:30.105
you and your sister now walk.

31:30.149 --> 31:34.893
You see, my dear,
I was not seduced.

31:34.936 --> 31:38.200
I did what I needed to do.

31:38.244 --> 31:46.687
I came to believe who I was,
what I was,

31:46.730 --> 31:50.821
and what my fate was,
and this is my fate.

31:50.865 --> 31:53.737
And your fate will surely
present itself soon

31:53.781 --> 31:56.044
when you are ready.

31:56.088 --> 32:01.484
Only one can make it
to the end.

32:01.528 --> 32:04.661
If you think I'm gonna hurt
my sister you're crazy.

32:04.705 --> 32:08.665
And I make my own fate.

32:09.623 --> 32:11.538
You're not ready.

32:47.095 --> 32:49.141
Son of a bitch.

33:06.549 --> 33:08.987
Nothing down by the lighthouse.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.601
What're you doing?

33:14.644 --> 33:16.037
He came this way.

33:16.081 --> 33:17.778
He kicked the shit out of me.

33:17.821 --> 33:19.258
One shot.

33:19.301 --> 33:20.563
The blood you gave him,
it didn't turn him,

33:20.607 --> 33:21.608
it energized him.

33:21.651 --> 33:23.523
So now what?

33:23.566 --> 33:25.568
If you were him
what would you do?

33:25.612 --> 33:27.048
Fight or flight.

33:27.092 --> 33:28.615
If I was stuck on this island
over 100 years

33:28.658 --> 33:30.834
I'd wanna get the hell
out of here.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.488
The boat.

33:45.110 --> 33:45.893
We beat him!

33:45.936 --> 33:47.460
The boat's still there!

33:48.374 --> 33:50.245
Something's not right.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.380
Scarlett I feel something.

33:56.686 --> 33:57.687
Hey!

33:57.731 --> 33:58.427
Get off of her!

33:58.471 --> 34:00.690
Stay back!

34:00.734 --> 34:04.390
You do not understand.

34:10.222 --> 34:12.659
Your blood is unlike anything

34:12.702 --> 34:16.750
I've ever tasted
in all these years.

34:16.793 --> 34:19.405
I need more.

34:19.448 --> 34:23.583
Oh, so much more.

34:27.456 --> 34:30.198
Then turn me so I can face you.

34:43.951 --> 34:49.783
[groaning]

35:48.015 --> 35:50.583
Uh... are you ok?

35:50.626 --> 35:53.499
He made his choice.

36:14.998 --> 36:16.826
We should get out of here.

36:18.741 --> 36:24.312
Yeah, um, are we gonna
talk about what just happened?

36:24.356 --> 36:25.966
What's there to talk about?

36:26.009 --> 36:28.708
What just happened is exactly
what we wanted to happen.

36:28.751 --> 36:30.579
We killed an elder
before it killed us.

36:30.623 --> 36:35.062
Right, but you just acted
like an animal.

36:35.105 --> 36:36.498
Sometimes that's what it takes.

36:36.542 --> 36:37.412
You really believe that?

36:37.456 --> 36:39.109
Absolutely.

36:39.153 --> 36:41.329
Vanessa, that's exactly
what I'm worried about.

36:41.373 --> 36:42.678
I'm fine, you're fine.

36:42.722 --> 36:43.636
He's dead.

36:43.679 --> 36:45.464
Actually, I'm not fine.

36:45.507 --> 36:48.902
And I don't think
you're fine, either.

36:48.945 --> 36:51.121
I mean, say what you want
but I was there both times

36:51.165 --> 36:54.951
that he had your blood
and something was happening.

36:54.995 --> 36:59.347
It was like he was...
seducing you.

36:59.391 --> 37:00.740
Please.

37:03.482 --> 37:04.787
Scarlett, I was tricking him.

37:04.831 --> 37:05.745
Bullshit.

37:05.788 --> 37:06.920
Why do you think
I turned around?

37:06.963 --> 37:08.791
What did he say to you?

37:08.835 --> 37:11.011
What did he say in your ear?

37:11.054 --> 37:12.404
Don't worry about it.

37:12.447 --> 37:13.796
-Don't worry about it?
-It was nothing.

37:13.840 --> 37:14.928
Clearly I am.

37:14.971 --> 37:17.713
Nothing? If it's nothing
then tell me.

37:17.757 --> 37:20.281
He said "rule with us".

37:20.325 --> 37:23.241
"Return to Renfield house
and rule with us".

37:23.284 --> 37:25.199
You think that's nothing?

37:25.243 --> 37:27.810
This guy, this thing, that
we find who turns out to be

37:27.854 --> 37:32.467
a relative of ours, he's there
for over 100 years

37:32.511 --> 37:34.339
and he finally has the chance
to have his freedom,

37:34.382 --> 37:37.690
he gets away from us
and he chooses to come back

37:37.733 --> 37:41.433
so that he can taste your blood
one more time,

37:41.476 --> 37:43.957
and then he says that he wants
to be with you

37:44.000 --> 37:46.481
and offers you to rule with him?

37:46.525 --> 37:47.526
[laughs]

37:47.569 --> 37:48.701
You don't think
that's a big deal?

37:48.744 --> 37:53.314
No. I think it's ridiculous.

37:53.358 --> 37:54.794
Come on, we gotta go.

37:54.837 --> 37:58.493
Let's get the totems
and let's go get our stu-

38:02.802 --> 38:04.282
I don't feel good.

38:06.327 --> 38:07.415
What's wrong?

38:07.459 --> 38:09.809
I don't feel so good.

38:12.464 --> 38:14.161
What's happening?

38:15.162 --> 38:17.251
It's alright, I'm just
a little dizzy. It's ok.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.949
Ok, look. Sit here
and just rest.

38:19.993 --> 38:21.168
I'll go get the totems.

38:21.211 --> 38:24.084
I'll be back in 15 minutes.
Stay there.

38:26.913 --> 38:28.523
Scarlett?

38:40.753 --> 38:42.407
Thank you.

38:45.671 --> 38:48.587
I know it hasn't always
been easy,

38:48.630 --> 38:52.242
but it's been really nice
to have you here.

38:52.286 --> 38:53.853
I needed you.

38:53.896 --> 38:55.942
Thank you.

38:55.985 --> 38:58.553
Of course.

38:58.597 --> 39:00.512
We're in this together.

39:02.688 --> 39:03.776
Go rest.

39:03.819 --> 39:05.734
I'll be back in a bit.

39:40.595 --> 39:42.641
I think we should split up.

39:44.033 --> 39:45.470
You go to the woods,

39:45.513 --> 39:47.210
I'll check down there real quick
and meet up with you.

39:47.254 --> 39:48.081
I think we're better off-

39:48.124 --> 39:49.387
Just trust me.

39:52.999 --> 39:55.001
If I start to turn...

39:55.044 --> 39:57.569
[groaning]

40:04.140 --> 40:06.360
You know what you have
to do, right?

40:06.404 --> 40:08.841
No, no, no, no, no.

40:12.714 --> 40:14.281
Vanessa!

40:15.413 --> 40:16.370
Vanessa!

40:16.414 --> 40:17.719
What're you doing?

40:17.763 --> 40:19.504
Come back!

40:19.547 --> 40:22.550
The elder said only one of us
will survive!

40:22.594 --> 40:25.161
I have to make sure that's you,
Scarlett!

40:25.205 --> 40:26.685
No, you don't, actually!

40:26.728 --> 40:28.121
We're a team!

40:28.164 --> 40:29.557
Please, come back!

40:29.601 --> 40:31.472
Don't leave me here!

40:31.516 --> 40:33.561
I need to make sure you live!

40:33.605 --> 40:34.736
What?!

40:34.780 --> 40:36.608
I need you to live!

40:36.651 --> 40:38.697
You're my sister!
I love you!

40:38.740 --> 40:41.395
If you love me then come back!

40:41.439 --> 40:43.528
Please, don't do this!

40:43.571 --> 40:46.095
You need to stay alive.

40:46.139 --> 40:48.315
I promised Axel I would
protect you.

40:48.358 --> 40:49.621
You don't get to decide that!

40:49.664 --> 40:51.884
That's not up to you!

40:51.927 --> 40:53.276
Come on, please, Vanessa!

40:53.320 --> 40:54.843
Come back!

40:54.887 --> 40:57.629
I'm sorry!

40:57.672 --> 41:00.327
I have to do this on my own!

41:00.370 --> 41:02.764
Vanessa, you don't!

41:02.808 --> 41:04.418
Please!

41:04.462 --> 41:05.463
Vanessa!

41:07.029 --> 41:08.901
Vanessa!

41:10.380 --> 41:14.254
Stop!

41:14.297 --> 41:15.995
Vanessa, please!

41:18.345 --> 41:20.565
Vanessa!

41:22.262 --> 41:25.613
You are not in control.

41:26.875 --> 41:28.616
Shit.

41:39.105 --> 41:42.108
[owl hooting]

42:10.223 --> 42:11.311
[Man] Hey!

42:11.354 --> 42:15.924
[screaming]

42:15.968 --> 42:17.970
[gun shot]
