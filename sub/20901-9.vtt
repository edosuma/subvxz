WEBVTT

09:15.180 --> 09:16.215
Are we ready?

09:16.347 --> 09:17.382
We are.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.139
It would be best if you stay.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.348
Don ’t mess with me.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.765
I didn’t hide when Dante ruled
this place. I won 't do it now.

09:24.898 --> 09:28.061
Dante was the devil
to your angel, Lola.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.524
But now...

09:29.652 --> 09:31.062
But now you are Dante.

09:31.738 --> 09:32.898
Excuse me ?

09:33.031 --> 09:36.819
You are the leader to follow.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.866
Or despise.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.194
That is what he means.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.037
It is dangerous out there.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.031
And I must face that danger...

09:45.710 --> 09:46.916
...with our people.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.202
Ready?

09:50.965 --> 09:52.000
Let's go!

11:24.809 --> 11:26.390
Keep storing empties.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.352
Next week, we will see
if we can fill one of the cisterns.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.349
Thank you.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.734
You don 't know
how much you have helped us.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.430
Hey! Hurry up, everyone!
They are coming!

12:06.559 --> 12:09.096
Eight down lndependencia,
a dozen up More/0s! Let's go!

12:10.230 --> 12:11.265
Infected!

28:45.390 --> 28:46.800
l\/lore infected got in.

28:49.269 --> 28:51.385
Leave them.
We will get them out tomorrow.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.559
You should sleep, Daniel.

28:55.692 --> 28:57.648
My mind is restless.

28:58.445 --> 28:59.480
I know.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.020
You are searching still. I saw you.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.360
I saw you look for her.

29:06.203 --> 29:07.568
It is a lot of faces.

29:10.374 --> 29:11.534
Sometimes I think...

29:13.543 --> 29:16.501
...she will be next in line.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.664
Hope is a hard thing to kill.

29:22.219 --> 29:24.676
Look, it is not my place
to say this to you.

29:25.138 --> 29:25.968
But...

29:31.144 --> 29:34.477
The North is overrun,
the beaches infested.

29:35.691 --> 29:38.307
East is the desert,
and south nothing but the hills.

29:40.028 --> 29:43.065
Hope is one thing,
but waiting is quite another.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.441
You also made me a promise.

29:48.996 --> 29:50.202
And I need you.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.739
I tell you as a friend.

29:54.543 --> 29:56.499
The search will break you.

29:58.714 --> 30:00.375
Nothing breaks me, Lola.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.506
I am immortal.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.337
Remember?

34:21.476 --> 34:23.683
-Next.
-P/ease, give me two more.

34:23.812 --> 34:25.348
My family is locked in at home.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.892
Hold on, brother.
We have got a lot of people here.

34:28.525 --> 34:29.560
One more, please!

34:30.193 --> 34:31.569
Give me more!

34:32.070 --> 34:33.401
Return the water!

34:34.948 --> 34:36.063
Filthy rats!

34:36.533 --> 34:37.693
Thieves!

34:38.785 --> 34:39.820
Give up the water!

34:39.953 --> 34:41.944
These ﬁlthy rats took over the dam.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.492
They killed the workers and kept it!

34:45.208 --> 34:47.540
Yes! Leave us the truck,
you sons of bitches!

34:47.669 --> 34:48.784
The time is now!

34:49.879 --> 34:51.415
Leave the truck, sons of bitches!

34:55.719 --> 34:56.925
Get out of the way!

34:57.887 --> 34:59.263
Give back the water!

34:59.389 --> 35:00.845
What happened to you?

35:00.974 --> 35:02.259
Get out of the way! Move!

35:02.392 --> 35:03.222
Move!

35:04.269 --> 35:05.258
Let's go! Let's go!

35:05.854 --> 35:06.684
Get the hose!

35:07.230 --> 35:08.219
Help her up!
