WEBVTT

00:01.042 --> 00:03.044
<i>Previously on</i> Billions.

00:04.045 --> 00:05.463
I buy a half hour

00:05.463 --> 00:08.008
on every major network,
live speech.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.468
Solicit honest feedback
from your employees.

00:10.468 --> 00:13.221
Use it as fuel for the speech.

00:13.221 --> 00:15.724
He goes into the speech
confident, he comes out sailing.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.475
I've been told
I needed to see you.

00:17.475 --> 00:19.894
When Wendy wants something,
she's very persuasive.

00:19.894 --> 00:21.813
And that's why I called her.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.148
With Bradford running point,

00:23.148 --> 00:24.524
the feedback's
gonna be jet fuel.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.067
So you want us to go back around

00:26.067 --> 00:27.736
and troll for negative feedback?

00:27.736 --> 00:29.654
This could implode MPC,

00:29.654 --> 00:32.323
as well as the campaign
and all of our places in it.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.409
I would consider it
a personal favor.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.412
We are gonna do something

00:37.412 --> 00:39.706
extremely hard.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.708
When did I become
Lex Luthor?

00:41.708 --> 00:44.669
Someone's quitting
isn't capitulation.

00:45.754 --> 00:46.963
So I shouldn't worry

00:46.963 --> 00:48.631
about seeking real love.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.717
I'm saying the way to get it
is to be a winner.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.218
Thank you...

00:52.218 --> 00:54.054
for not keeping me safe.

00:54.054 --> 00:57.057
The destiny is in me.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.976
I put him back together

00:59.976 --> 01:02.729
after you kicked the pieces
across the floor.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.397
I'm Mike Prince.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.399
Mike is trending
on every platform.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.234
It's done.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.819
I saw.

01:09.819 --> 01:12.655
Someday, and that day
will definitely come,

01:12.655 --> 01:15.992
I will call upon you
to repay this debt.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.233
This is totally amazing.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.903
That's how I do. I aim to amaze.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.280
You've done it. I thought it was
only a theoretical model.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.616
It was, back when you were
a Stanford Cardinal.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.368
It's viable now.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.286
What compressive strength
have you managed to achieve?

02:00.286 --> 02:04.082
As you know, the standard crap
ranges from 3,000 to 5,000 psi.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.792
My little baby
gets close to 6,000.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.877
- Damn.
- Plus, when the cracks form,

02:07.877 --> 02:09.963
the bacteria creates
a self-healing effect.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.549
It's an organic, high-tech mimic
of the lime clasts

02:12.549 --> 02:15.385
and volcanic ash
from Ancient Roman concrete

02:15.385 --> 02:17.595
that's had those buildings
standing for thousands of years.

02:17.595 --> 02:18.972
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.557
It's almost ready
to go to market

02:20.557 --> 02:22.475
and present
to the Cement Masons unions.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.644
That's why I moved the lab
here a little while back.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.396
Before you do,

02:26.396 --> 02:28.148
you gotta let me walk you
in to my guy.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.261
Okay, so you are gonna want

02:58.261 --> 03:01.264
to practice your starts,
your stops, your signals,

03:01.264 --> 03:04.017
and your merges
before your next road test

03:04.017 --> 03:05.852
so you don't have to do
this whole Phi Slama Jama

03:05.852 --> 03:07.270
a third time.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.814
So I definitely failed?

03:09.814 --> 03:11.691
Flatter than a pancake.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.694
And when you're ready
to give it another go,

03:14.694 --> 03:17.530
you just head to the website
and book another test.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.950
Well, since-- since we
know he'll pass the next one,

03:20.950 --> 03:24.454
how's about we save everyone
the trouble.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.122
He was so close this time.

03:26.122 --> 03:30.168
There must be a way
to shave a point or add one?

03:30.168 --> 03:32.879
Close? No.
Not a word I'd use.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.672
The bus was close, though.

03:34.672 --> 03:36.382
Which bus?

03:36.382 --> 03:38.760
The bus that your young charge
almost sideswiped,

03:38.760 --> 03:41.512
like Rick Mahorn did Wilkins
that time.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.891
Phi Slama Jama.
Rick Mahorn.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.935
You're a sports fan.

03:46.935 --> 03:50.063
And unlike the boy, sir,
you are a quick study.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.440
That I am.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.900
What's your name, sir?

03:53.900 --> 03:56.611
Quinn. Ern Quinn. Mr. Quinn.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.030
Well, Ern,
I think the thing to do

03:59.030 --> 04:01.991
is for you to get some tickets
to see a game,

04:01.991 --> 04:03.493
which is expensive, I know.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.161
So, what I'm thinking is,

04:05.161 --> 04:06.579
we make that happen...

04:09.749 --> 04:12.752
and then you make
the driver's license happen.

04:17.465 --> 04:19.842
This is ridiculous.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.137
I was social friends
with Robert Moses!

04:24.889 --> 04:27.267
Don't say your daddy's name.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.601
I'll tell them
to call Mom.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.687
No. She'll flay me.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.397
I should have made one of them
come with me.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.274
These DMVs--

04:34.274 --> 04:37.652
Stands for Dumb Motherfucking
Varmints, by the way!--

04:39.279 --> 04:41.614
just want to charge
a higher price.

04:44.325 --> 04:47.787
I got this.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.086
To build.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.046
That's man's impulse.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.007
Well, mine, anyway.

04:59.007 --> 05:02.218
But the best-made structures,
how long do they last?

05:02.218 --> 05:05.054
Not long enough that future
civilizations won't use

05:05.054 --> 05:07.515
the rubble of ours
as a mere foundation.

05:07.515 --> 05:08.891
Until now.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.853
Bio-inspired
vascular concrete.

05:11.853 --> 05:14.772
It recognizes the weaknesses
within the concrete system

05:14.772 --> 05:18.484
and is able to enzymatically
repair itself.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.069
This will revolutionize

05:20.069 --> 05:21.571
the country's crumbling infrastructure.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.323
This material
rebuilds the past,

05:23.323 --> 05:25.992
fortifies the present,
secures the future.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.618
This is magnificent.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.162
It really is.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.497
This is a game changer.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.751
But the path
from innovation to market

05:34.751 --> 05:36.336
is fraught with danger.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.087
It's Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots
out there.

05:38.087 --> 05:40.465
This can't be one of those
that doesn't make it.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.008
Uh...

05:42.008 --> 05:44.969
What danger, exactly?

05:44.969 --> 05:49.015
Deep-pocketed competitors, copycats,

05:49.015 --> 05:50.725
foreign governments
willing to steal it.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.352
As you know,
all those things and more

05:52.352 --> 05:54.562
can destroy
a young company.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.523
But I can protect it.
And you.

06:09.243 --> 06:12.747
You see, man's impulse
is also to buy.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.792
I want to get behind this
in a big way.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.044
I can take care of knocking out
the competitors,

06:18.044 --> 06:20.922
as well as all
the execution stuff,

06:20.922 --> 06:22.340
the blocking and tackling

06:22.340 --> 06:23.841
you don't need
to get bogged down with.

06:23.841 --> 06:26.469
This is something
that will help the world,

06:26.469 --> 06:28.221
and we'll all get rich doing it.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.891
I'm having in-house counsel join

06:31.891 --> 06:34.685
so we can move quickly
and aggressively.

06:34.685 --> 06:38.147
I'm prepared to purchase
your entire company

06:38.147 --> 06:39.649
and back a more robust timetable,

06:39.649 --> 06:41.901
rolling this out
in the next 14 months.

06:41.901 --> 06:45.113
No, no, I'm not
handing you the reins.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.742
This is my life's work.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.702
Which you'll lose no matter what

06:51.702 --> 06:53.454
now that you've stuck
your head out.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.541
But we can prevent that.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.917
We will prevent it.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.210
This way, your vision
is protected

06:59.210 --> 07:00.753
and you get paid fairly.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.630
You don't buy me out.

07:02.630 --> 07:05.174
I made my bones when you were
going out with cheerleaders.

07:05.174 --> 07:07.718
So, a Moe Greene no.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.597
What ended up happening
to old Moe after that?

07:18.896 --> 07:20.606
Thank you all
for your time.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.316
And the fucking scones.

07:25.194 --> 07:26.487
I'm not selling.

07:42.253 --> 07:45.423
Look, he put his whole
professional life into this.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.925
I just think he didn't see
the blitzkrieg coming.

07:47.925 --> 07:49.635
I didn't either.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.263
Maybe you can go
and talk to him.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.265
I can. I'll try.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.225
But he is stubborn.

07:56.225 --> 07:57.894
I mean, real stubborn.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.687
Yeah, okay, you do that.

07:59.687 --> 08:02.273
Talk some reason into him.
This is the way he wins.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.025
Because if I can't have
his company this way,

08:04.025 --> 08:05.276
I want his tech.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.652
And I'll get it.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.198
Legally. Aboveboard.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.825
Fins up, you know
what I'm saying, Kate?

08:17.371 --> 08:19.415
We'll make a dang fortune,
and this is the kind of idea

08:19.415 --> 08:22.251
custom-made to campaign on.

08:22.251 --> 08:25.796
A new foundation
for America.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.673
I'm on it.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.025
Hello, son.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.861
Dad, I'm fine.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.030
Kev, that's code
for "not fine."

08:51.030 --> 08:53.824
I fucked up
and said your name.

08:53.824 --> 08:55.535
<i>To whom?</i>

08:55.535 --> 08:58.746
I found the one sorry
son of a bitch at the DMV

08:58.746 --> 09:02.458
that doesn't know the difference
between a gratuity and a bribe.

09:03.417 --> 09:04.877
Don't say another word,

09:04.877 --> 09:06.379
<i>either of you.</i>

09:10.174 --> 09:11.676
I'm planning
on telling Mike

09:11.676 --> 09:13.094
he should punt
on the performance reviews.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.929
Oh, you're planning.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.682
Well, I mean,
if you want to,

09:17.682 --> 09:19.225
I'll of course
step back and--

09:19.225 --> 09:20.810
I thought that's why
you said it that way,

09:20.810 --> 09:22.061
so I would do it for you.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.688
For Mike. For the firm.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.440
It's not something
that can be punted.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.735
After those truth-telling
sessions, folks are queasy.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.612
I think the staff knows
that Mike would never use

09:31.612 --> 09:34.282
performance reviews
as a way to exact vengeance

09:34.282 --> 09:36.701
on people who merely spoke
the truth about what they felt.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.619
Yeah, well, the mere fact

09:38.619 --> 09:40.955
that you just referred
to them as "staff"

09:40.955 --> 09:43.040
says a lot about how
they'll feel being judged.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.584
Well, I guess your finger
is just lodged

09:44.584 --> 09:45.876
right on the carotid of--

09:45.876 --> 09:47.503
No guesswork.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.505
That's all anybody talked
about at movie night.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.757
Movie night? Is that
a colloquialism for something?

09:51.757 --> 09:53.259
Popcorn. Big screen.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.011
I'm surprised
you decided to skip.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.597
Oh, shit.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.432
Didn't know
this was a thing.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.225
Wasn't invited.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.935
I should have
double-checked their list.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.895
- I just assumed they'd--
- What'd you watch?

10:04.895 --> 10:06.439
Double feature.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.773
<i>Glengarry and Wolf of Wall Street.</i>

10:07.773 --> 10:09.358
Of course.

10:09.358 --> 10:11.235
Do they even know what Wolf
is really saying?

10:11.235 --> 10:12.445
Victor does.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.364
Sacker, obv. Rian.

10:15.364 --> 10:17.283
The rest,
they think they should know

10:17.283 --> 10:19.243
how to sell a pen better.

10:19.243 --> 10:21.120
- You'll come next time.
- Oh, no.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.456
You're the man of the people.
I'll remain where I belong.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.583
Slightly above the staff.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.251
Your words, not mine.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.258
Scooter just texted me.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.968
I understand the concern
about the performance reviews.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.803
- When the fuck did you--?
- You don't get here

10:37.803 --> 10:39.472
without being able
to multitask.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.432
Like how you can do
a double shot of Michter's

10:41.432 --> 10:44.143
while re-enacting your favorite
Nikki Dial-Rocco Siffredi scene.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.645
Who are those people?

10:45.645 --> 10:46.979
Better you don't know.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.522
Okay.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.900
I'll recuse myself
from the review process.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.902
I was planning
on doing it anyway.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.655
I can't be seen as rewarding or
punishing anyone on the team...

10:55.655 --> 10:57.448
Team. Not staff.
There you go.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.492
...just because they said
bad or good things about me.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.118
Still, we have to do it.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.162
Can't go forward
without a thorough look back

11:03.162 --> 11:07.166
and a real evaluation of trading
tendencies, habits, all of it.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.168
How does that work
without you in the middle of it?

11:09.168 --> 11:10.836
You two will run the thing.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.755
I'm glad to leave it
in your able hands.

11:21.555 --> 11:23.516
I need in there. Thank you.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.354
Dad. Kevin. What?

11:28.354 --> 11:31.065
It's just
a bureaucratic squabble.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.734
This aged man's attempt
at bribing me

11:33.734 --> 11:37.822
failed as badly as this young
man failed his driving test.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.990
- He called the cops.
- You called the cops?

11:39.990 --> 11:41.367
I called the cops.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.703
If money changed hands,

11:43.703 --> 11:45.871
we're going to have
to arrest and charge.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.125
Don't make me
ask the question.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.211
What question is that?

11:52.211 --> 11:54.130
Please.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.133
Yes, I know who you are.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.801
But it's a tight spot here.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.429
Can we have a moment
with my father?

12:10.271 --> 12:12.481
Charles, why are you
even here,

12:12.481 --> 12:14.316
and what did you think
you were doing?

12:14.316 --> 12:15.818
Making sure it went well.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.571
That peon had it in for Kevin

12:18.571 --> 12:19.864
the moment he saw the Jag.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.240
It intimidated him.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.578
And like I said,
he didn't know the difference

12:25.578 --> 12:27.163
between a bribe and a tip.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.581
I heard that.

12:29.623 --> 12:31.417
You're going to jail.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.586
And Rhoades, Kevin,
will be prohibited

12:33.586 --> 12:36.255
from holding a license to drive
in New York state.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.090
Jesus!

12:41.844 --> 12:44.138
I am aware
that attempted bribery--

12:44.138 --> 12:46.724
if that is in fact what can be
proved to have happened here

12:46.724 --> 12:48.434
is a serious offense.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.770
I can guarantee his appearance
at arraignment,

12:50.770 --> 12:52.480
but if you will do me
the courtesy

12:52.480 --> 12:54.440
of releasing him
and referring this

12:54.440 --> 12:56.275
to the DA's office
for investigation,

12:56.275 --> 12:57.860
it would be appreciated.

12:57.860 --> 13:01.280
I'd have to check
with my superiors.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.117
Well, check with the commish.

13:05.117 --> 13:08.454
I have Raul Gomez
in my favorites.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.872
Thank you.

13:11.582 --> 13:14.376
The Department of Motor Vehicles
is not a playground

13:14.376 --> 13:16.045
for the well-connected
to do as they will.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.296
Ha!

13:17.296 --> 13:20.132
That is a clerk's mentality...

13:22.510 --> 13:26.472
and a clerk you will always
fucking be.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.390
Dad! Not helping.

13:28.390 --> 13:29.975
Uh...

13:29.975 --> 13:31.477
You know,
the sad fact is

13:31.477 --> 13:33.896
that some senility
awaits us all

13:33.896 --> 13:35.815
in the golden years.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.650
Oh, bullshit.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.069
Oh, are you saying he's...?

13:41.987 --> 13:44.615
There are over
100 types of dementia.

13:48.202 --> 13:52.122
So, it can be tough to pinpoint
which we're talking about,

13:52.122 --> 13:53.958
but I think it's clear
that something...

13:53.958 --> 13:55.960
My last med workup
says I'm sharp

13:55.960 --> 13:57.920
as a goddamn titanium tack.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.339
Can you say the same?

14:02.550 --> 14:04.260
The commissioner
is granting your request.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.511
You're free to go.

14:05.511 --> 14:06.762
But he is indeed
referring it

14:06.762 --> 14:08.013
to the DA's office.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.265
Great. Swell. Perfect.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.558
Wouldn't have it
any other way.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.851
Thank you, officer.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.435
And thank you, sir,

14:13.435 --> 14:16.146
for your fealty
to the auto safety corridor.

14:16.146 --> 14:19.483
I note the sarcasm,
for the record.

14:23.571 --> 14:27.032
Bowing and scraping
like that?

14:27.032 --> 14:29.451
I thought you had juice!

14:29.451 --> 14:31.787
Can we just get out of here, please?

14:38.085 --> 14:41.130
Well, this should be more fun
than movie night.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.840
No one thought
you would want to come.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.049
And right they were.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.593
Okay, on the screens

14:45.593 --> 14:47.094
in front of each of us
are dossiers

14:47.094 --> 14:48.846
covering the P&Ls, activities,

14:48.846 --> 14:52.057
results and tendencies
of each person who works at MPC.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.727
We will conduct interviews
and do the feedback sessions

14:54.727 --> 14:56.729
after we--

14:56.729 --> 14:58.272
We aren't at
the feedback stage yet.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.940
- You'll be called in.
- Yeah, no, we won't.

14:59.940 --> 15:03.402
My man speaketh the truth.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.946
I'm not sure why I just used
that biblical version of speak,

15:05.946 --> 15:07.698
but I did, so...

15:07.698 --> 15:10.618
Because what we are saying
is as monumental

15:10.618 --> 15:13.037
as that language implies.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.747
Yes. Yeah.
We were elected to tell you

15:14.747 --> 15:17.416
that we all reject
the framework of this panel

15:17.416 --> 15:18.792
judging us and our work.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.878
The employees can't reject--

15:20.878 --> 15:22.254
- Team members.
- Absolutely.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.923
The team members
can't reject the idea

15:23.923 --> 15:25.424
that their performance
is being evaluated.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.676
Well, we are rejecting you,
all of you,

15:27.676 --> 15:29.261
as the ones evaluating.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.847
You don't get to pick
how management decides.

15:31.847 --> 15:35.225
Management does.
That's how business works.

15:35.225 --> 15:37.394
Upon a time it did.
Not now.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.604
It's true, Wags.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.522
We are in an un-brave new world.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.110
I mean, no offense, Scooter,

15:45.110 --> 15:47.363
but you're not in touch
with the rank and file.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.948
You don't even come
to movie night.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.741
- I wasn't inv--
- 'Cause we knew you wouldn't

15:50.741 --> 15:53.661
want to and didn't want
to put you in the position.

15:53.661 --> 15:57.039
As I said.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.500
Look, the only one with
the right to decide our fate

15:59.500 --> 16:01.460
is the actual decider.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.088
But you all said that once you
gave your evaluation of Prince,

16:04.088 --> 16:07.049
you weren't comfortable
with him conducting this review.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.885
That is right and true.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.804
Yeah, well, he decided
to change everything,

16:11.804 --> 16:14.807
so we all reject
the whole of it.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.310
You roll it all
for a least a year.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.354
No performance reviews
until then.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.898
Or you can do it without
any performers to review.

16:22.898 --> 16:25.275
You do know that comp
is directly tied

16:25.275 --> 16:26.819
to performance review?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.737
Not this year,
it isn't.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.164
Well, fuck.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.500
Indeed.

16:45.546 --> 16:48.424
Well, you really brought out
the all-star team

16:48.424 --> 16:52.428
for this vital matter of state
security involving my father.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.682
As have you, Chuck,

16:56.682 --> 17:01.687
with the great and powerful
Freddie Eisen in your corner.

17:03.063 --> 17:05.816
He always brings a gun
to a knife fight.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.360
Yeah, it's just like
the government to lard it on.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.821
You're always looking for
a chance to squander resources.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.199
Uh, no offense, Chuck.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.492
Yeah, sure, Eisen.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.870
Look, I think we all know

17:17.870 --> 17:19.121
the bright light
of attention

17:19.121 --> 17:21.206
is on this matter
because of me.

17:21.206 --> 17:23.125
You're trying
to bleed me here.

17:23.125 --> 17:26.170
Bleed you? For what?

17:26.170 --> 17:28.756
A notch in your hatchet.
Uh, making a quota.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.425
Some time in the limelight.
Who knows?

17:31.425 --> 17:35.471
Rubbish. We have kept
the press out of it so far,

17:35.471 --> 17:37.222
and that's proof
that you're off base.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.641
But this is
a chargeable offense.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.185
Ah. This is where I come in.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.729
- Mm.
- Uh, rubbish.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.148
You're gonna have an impossible
time proving anything

17:46.148 --> 17:48.859
beyond giving
an unlawful gratuity,

17:48.859 --> 17:50.235
which is a class "A"
misdemeanor.

17:50.235 --> 17:53.072
So, no jail time,

17:53.072 --> 17:55.157
a fine,

17:55.157 --> 17:58.869
and a course... maybe.

17:58.869 --> 18:02.581
There is no driving course
on how not to be an asshole.

18:04.958 --> 18:08.378
But in this case,
maybe we invent one.

18:11.381 --> 18:12.800
Okay.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.052
But we expect
the maximum on the fine,

18:15.052 --> 18:19.139
and even that may not placate
the DMV folks.

18:20.766 --> 18:21.975
Agreed.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.019
You got a good deal here.

18:24.019 --> 18:25.938
A real sweetheart.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.775
Better than you deserve.

18:30.984 --> 18:32.444
If my client will take it.

18:34.071 --> 18:35.405
I'll let you know.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.123
Well, if the bank
wants to call that loan,

18:44.123 --> 18:45.916
you tell them you'll move
the corpus of the trust

18:45.916 --> 18:47.709
to another institution.

18:47.709 --> 18:50.379
Dad, don't conduct your
so-called business from here.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.922
We have to resolve
this situation--

18:51.922 --> 18:53.465
Some birds are chirping
in the background.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.716
I can't hear a thing.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.010
Get back to me with good news.

18:59.930 --> 19:03.809
There is nothing to resolve with
the DMV as far as I'm concerned.

19:05.060 --> 19:07.187
Well, as counsel,
I have to disagree.

19:07.187 --> 19:09.982
At least present you
with the deal we were able to--

19:09.982 --> 19:12.693
Well, no matter how good a deal
you think you struck

19:12.693 --> 19:14.570
with your colleagues,

19:14.570 --> 19:16.530
I won't sign it.

19:17.739 --> 19:19.324
They should apologize to me.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.535
And Kevin.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.829
Thank you for your efforts, Freddie.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.003
You picked the wrong guy
to try to charm, Pop.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.504
So now you have to--

19:32.504 --> 19:36.008
That examiner
was a power-mad little man

19:36.008 --> 19:38.510
who should have passed Kevin
on principle alone.

19:41.471 --> 19:42.723
Uh...

19:42.723 --> 19:45.100
what principle is that?

19:45.100 --> 19:47.853
That the Rhoades family
has contributed more

19:47.853 --> 19:49.688
to this city and state than--

19:49.688 --> 19:51.857
Tell that to the bus driver.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.108
No, no.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.526
You see, close call or not,

19:54.526 --> 19:57.112
Kevin avoided that bus.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.655
- Ah.
- And that's all that matters.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.365
That's real life.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.951
Near collisions. Near disaster.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.620
That's when the mettle shows.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.663
Our boy has it.

20:06.663 --> 20:08.540
Shows he's got the skills.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.045
That still doesn't speak
to the attempted bribe.

20:14.087 --> 20:18.884
Boyo, if I take the fall
for unlawful gratuity,

20:18.884 --> 20:22.888
that DMV apparatchik
should go down for accepting it.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.391
He didn't accept it.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.061
He allowed you to complete
the criminal act to bust you.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.854
Don't be such an asshole.

20:30.854 --> 20:33.357
Ah.

20:33.357 --> 20:34.900
If you saw the look
on Kevin's face

20:34.900 --> 20:37.110
when he heard
that he had failed...

20:39.154 --> 20:40.530
you'd have done the same.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.408
That's called love.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.331
Yeah, but I didn't see it...

20:51.667 --> 20:53.001
because I wasn't there.

20:56.380 --> 20:59.174
That is true.

20:59.174 --> 21:01.927
He asked you to take him.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.179
Not Wendy or me.

21:07.474 --> 21:10.352
I had been so overtaken
with the idea

21:10.352 --> 21:12.437
that you insinuated yourself

21:12.437 --> 21:14.940
into the situation
with the examiner,

21:14.940 --> 21:16.358
I hadn't stopped to think--

21:16.358 --> 21:19.319
Well, it's high time you did.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.948
He reached out
to a paternal figure

21:22.948 --> 21:25.117
who was not, in fact...

21:27.077 --> 21:28.453
his father.

21:30.163 --> 21:33.041
Maybe he knew I'd risk
life and liberty on his behalf.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.962
Maybe he counted on that.

21:36.962 --> 21:41.550
Maybe he knew
I was the only one.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.224
Who's the asshole now?

21:54.563 --> 21:58.358
Who's the asshole...

21:58.358 --> 22:00.277
now?

22:21.340 --> 22:23.342
What the hell
did you do to me?

22:24.551 --> 22:25.969
To you, or for you?

22:25.969 --> 22:28.013
I went over his proposal,
and there's a ton

22:28.013 --> 22:29.806
of upside there.
And what he was saying

22:29.806 --> 22:31.516
about the pitfalls facing
a young company--

22:31.516 --> 22:33.852
You don't think I know
about the pitfalls?

22:33.852 --> 22:35.687
I told you and your
lab mates about them

22:35.687 --> 22:38.523
chapter and goddamn verse
back in the day, if you recall.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.818
This is different.

22:41.818 --> 22:45.238
This is a robber baron making
a move on a proprietary process.

22:45.238 --> 22:47.532
I'm telling you, Mike Prince
is one of the good guys.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.910
- Oh, jeez!
- Does he have sharp elbows?

22:49.910 --> 22:51.411
Of course he does.
He has to.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.413
And you want him to.
It's what you need.

22:53.413 --> 22:57.626
But he's got the company's
best interests at heart.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.753
Is that why
he's started an attack?

23:01.213 --> 23:04.966
Your "good guy" Prince

23:04.966 --> 23:08.178
has begun buying up
rival patents.

23:08.178 --> 23:12.057
Even ones vaguely related
to what my process does.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.893
Which gives him standing
to sue me for infringement.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.020
Which will block my work
due to injunction,

23:17.020 --> 23:19.398
potentially for years.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.234
It's called patent sharking.

23:22.234 --> 23:25.404
And it's not
what good guys do.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.742
"Fins up." Fuck!

23:31.785 --> 23:33.745
Yeah-- Shit, look,

23:33.745 --> 23:37.666
it may not be exactly what you
wanted, but similar terms,

23:37.666 --> 23:39.918
some compromises
were always gonna be a reality.

23:41.128 --> 23:42.963
Selling to Prince
without a fight

23:42.963 --> 23:44.464
is the best move now.

23:44.464 --> 23:45.924
If you do,
Prince will relent

23:45.924 --> 23:47.592
and the company
will be spared all this.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.052
You hope.

23:50.762 --> 23:52.556
You will be credited
for creating

23:52.556 --> 23:54.558
this self-healing concrete.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.560
The Nobel Prize doesn't go
to the hedge fund dude

23:56.560 --> 23:58.770
who financed the thing.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.939
Let me lay out a look
at a slightly different future:

24:02.149 --> 24:03.483
yours.

24:06.027 --> 24:07.779
You, Philip...

24:09.781 --> 24:11.825
have been slowly,
or not so slowly,

24:11.825 --> 24:13.827
selling your soul.

24:13.827 --> 24:17.289
And soon,
there'll be none left.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.292
You'll never be happy
at Michael Prince Capital,

24:20.292 --> 24:22.127
because the longer you stay,

24:22.127 --> 24:24.296
the more you'll learn
about Michael Prince...

24:25.589 --> 24:27.466
and the more
you'll hate yourself.

24:33.180 --> 24:36.224
I've been
a scientist-businessman

24:36.224 --> 24:38.935
and a businessman-scientist.

24:38.935 --> 24:42.063
And when one serves
the other, it can work.

24:43.607 --> 24:47.319
The other way
is just a slow death

24:47.319 --> 24:49.321
of everything
you ever hoped to be.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.864
Marc, come on,
you still have a chance

24:50.864 --> 24:52.324
to win big on this
right now.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.951
You just got to show
some flexibility.

24:56.828 --> 25:00.207
It's a wonder I ever achieved
tenure without your counsel.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.367
In Will Guidara's book
<i>Unreasonable Hospitality,</i>

25:35.367 --> 25:37.118
he tells a story about how,

25:37.118 --> 25:39.788
when someone misses
a few meetings or is late,

25:39.788 --> 25:41.790
the instinct is
to get right in their face

25:41.790 --> 25:44.376
and give them
massive guff about it.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.336
Instead, Will says
the thing to do

25:46.336 --> 25:48.463
is check in
about their welfare first.

25:48.463 --> 25:50.382
I'm hunky-dory. Peachy keen.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.883
Look, I had stuff
to take care of.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.176
Business stuff, and--

25:53.176 --> 25:55.345
No. Or, yes, but...

25:55.345 --> 25:57.806
whatever's getting in your head,
distracting you from your work,

25:57.806 --> 25:59.391
because you did miss
two meetings,

25:59.391 --> 26:01.226
in which I covered,
of course, but--

26:01.226 --> 26:03.353
No, really, it's a business
thing I was seeing to.

26:03.353 --> 26:04.896
The Ruloff thing.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.275
You need to talk to Wendy.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.694
Your breathing, your cadence,
the pitch of your voice

26:10.694 --> 26:12.070
tell me there's plenty
of emotion

26:12.070 --> 26:13.738
mixed in there
with the business.

26:13.738 --> 26:17.033
I've been there with
an innovator I cared about,

26:17.033 --> 26:19.160
thinking there was a balance
to be struck.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.620
And was there?

26:20.620 --> 26:22.205
No.

26:22.205 --> 26:23.957
I should have focused
only on the business.

26:23.957 --> 26:25.834
Because the corrosive,
controlling part

26:25.834 --> 26:29.004
was already in the inventor,
as it is with your Dr. Ruloff.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.089
That's why he doesn't want
to partner, he wants it all.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.091
I think you got him wrong.

26:33.091 --> 26:35.260
Wendy'll help you
figure that out.

26:52.193 --> 26:53.445
I fucked up.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.280
Huge mistake.

26:56.906 --> 26:59.200
How much is it gonna cost
Prince, the firm?

26:59.200 --> 27:00.577
No.

27:00.577 --> 27:02.370
The opposite, I think.

27:02.370 --> 27:06.207
But despite that,
if something isn't done,

27:06.207 --> 27:08.501
if I don't do something to
change what's about to happen,

27:08.501 --> 27:10.378
I don't know how the hell
I'm gonna be able

27:10.378 --> 27:11.963
to live with myself.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.675
Well, then
you'd better have a seat.

27:15.675 --> 27:17.135
Start at the beginning.

27:29.856 --> 27:32.859
I've likely extricated you
from legal trouble.

27:32.859 --> 27:35.487
Your friend down at the DMV's
gonna get promoted.

27:35.487 --> 27:38.156
And his boss has a kid

27:38.156 --> 27:40.075
who's gonna get
an internship at Justice.

27:40.075 --> 27:44.329
So they'll quietly accept
the misdemeanor.

27:45.538 --> 27:49.084
But what we have to discuss now

27:49.084 --> 27:53.171
is the line of succession
around here.

27:53.171 --> 27:56.508
I just want it to remain clear
that I am a viable alternative

27:56.508 --> 28:00.345
if the two of you are unable
to fulfill your parental duties.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.430
That's all very
well and good, Charles,

28:02.430 --> 28:03.848
but Kevin,

28:03.848 --> 28:05.266
you need to know--

28:05.266 --> 28:08.728
Your mother and I
are your first calls

28:08.728 --> 28:10.188
and your last.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.023
But I did.

28:15.568 --> 28:18.029
"Mom, my driving test
is Monday morning.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.948
Can you take me?"

28:19.948 --> 28:23.535
"I have a meeting that morning.
Have you asked your father?"

28:25.620 --> 28:27.414
"Dad, Monday morning, DMV?"

28:27.414 --> 28:30.959
Uh-huh.
"Is it possible to reschedule?"

28:30.959 --> 28:33.044
It wasn't possible.

28:34.754 --> 28:37.632
Kev, if you'd answered "no,"
I'd have found the time.

28:37.632 --> 28:39.008
As would I have,
if I'd known

28:39.008 --> 28:41.386
your father responded
he couldn't.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.139
This is about you communicating
your needs more directly.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.725
I did. I called Grandpa.

28:46.725 --> 28:50.145
And I stepped forward,
once more into the breech.

28:50.145 --> 28:53.648
I believe Kevin has
what the kids call receipts.

28:56.776 --> 28:59.195
None of us behaved
perfectly here.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.656
Ah, shit, Kev,

29:01.656 --> 29:04.033
the immediate answer
should have been yes.

29:04.033 --> 29:05.660
I know that.

29:05.660 --> 29:07.537
I get caught up.

29:07.537 --> 29:09.247
We both do.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.083
This is...

29:13.626 --> 29:15.044
I'm just glad
this is the extent

29:15.044 --> 29:16.337
of the price we're paying,

29:16.337 --> 29:17.714
and that it was your grandfather

29:17.714 --> 29:20.216
and not you
with the bribery.

29:21.760 --> 29:26.639
I will go say good night
to my granddaughter.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.851
And for the record,

29:29.851 --> 29:33.271
Kevin drove the hell
out of that Jag under my watch.

29:33.271 --> 29:34.773
Hmm.

29:34.773 --> 29:39.444
My boy, there was a time
when a Benjamin Franklin

29:39.444 --> 29:41.571
was the key to the city.

29:41.571 --> 29:46.075
My mistake was not accounting
for inflation.

29:50.538 --> 29:52.582
Oh, God.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.584
Just when I thought
maybe we weren't too bad

29:54.584 --> 29:56.044
at this parenting thing.

29:56.044 --> 30:00.256
Yeah. Evidence to the contrary.

30:00.256 --> 30:03.301
You and I need to communicate
every day about them.

30:03.301 --> 30:05.053
That's where we fucked up.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.888
Because if we'd been talking
directly, one of us...

30:06.888 --> 30:08.473
- No doubt. No doubt.
- ...would have--

30:11.100 --> 30:12.977
As far as working together better...

30:14.437 --> 30:15.814
I pledge to do my part.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.150
As do I.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.660
I had a strange convo
at work today.

30:33.081 --> 30:36.125
I have to imagine
that's, uh, the norm there.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.961
Kind of your job.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.921
Yeah, but this...

30:41.548 --> 30:43.716
I'll share,
since it wasn't a formal,

30:43.716 --> 30:45.385
privileged conversation.

30:45.385 --> 30:48.221
I sat him on the couch
instead of the chairs.

30:48.221 --> 30:49.764
Uh-huh.

30:51.391 --> 30:52.892
One of the heads of the firm.

30:52.892 --> 30:55.186
Young guy named Philip Charyn.

30:55.186 --> 30:58.439
There's a real
bare-knuckle business thing

30:58.439 --> 31:00.024
that an outside figure,
young Philip,

31:00.024 --> 31:02.235
finds himself
on the opposite side of Prince.

31:03.319 --> 31:04.821
Emotionally, though.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.364
That's not a position
he can take publicly

31:06.364 --> 31:07.574
within the firm.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.286
Sounds Byzantine.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.540
It seemed to me
that he was asking me

31:15.540 --> 31:18.543
to bring you in
on the situation,

31:18.543 --> 31:20.545
to pursue the issue
on his behalf.

31:20.545 --> 31:22.338
Huh.

31:22.338 --> 31:25.383
And what did you indicate back?

31:25.383 --> 31:28.845
Oh, I talked to him
about the blood-brain barrier.

31:28.845 --> 31:32.223
How it keeps bacteria,
viruses, fungus,

31:32.223 --> 31:34.893
parasites in the bloodstream
out of the brain.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.937
Parallel health achieved
by no cross-contamination.

31:37.937 --> 31:40.690
Well, sounds about right.

31:40.690 --> 31:43.651
And, uh, we should
keep it that way.

31:45.570 --> 31:49.949
For the health of the family
and, uh, our individual sanity.

31:50.950 --> 31:53.244
That's exactly what I said.

31:56.247 --> 31:58.333
Wow.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.918
In this arena,

31:59.918 --> 32:02.629
communication has never
been an issue.

32:02.629 --> 32:05.173
We each know exactly
what the other means,

32:05.173 --> 32:07.216
no matter what the other says.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.803
It's somehow reassuring...

32:12.138 --> 32:14.098
and horrifying
at the same time.

32:14.098 --> 32:15.600
Quite so.

32:26.986 --> 32:28.279
Do I need to call a lawyer?

32:29.322 --> 32:30.657
You sent for me.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.910
You didn't tape an X
to a telephone pole,

32:33.910 --> 32:36.037
but you asked for a meet
just the same.

32:36.996 --> 32:38.289
I don't want to talk to you.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.625
Of course you don't.

32:43.836 --> 32:45.171
Your mouth is dry.

32:45.171 --> 32:46.798
You look like you put in
some hard miles.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.591
You need to hydrate.

32:53.221 --> 32:56.307
Marc Ruloff is a good man,
a great man.

32:56.307 --> 32:57.850
And I put him
in Mike Prince's crosshairs.

32:57.850 --> 32:59.560
That's on me.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.854
What if you could
unwind it?

33:01.854 --> 33:04.315
Find a way to save Ruloff's
company from Prince?

33:05.733 --> 33:07.986
Well, I can't. I've tried.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.696
Maybe I can.

33:12.448 --> 33:14.826
Can you give me
an illegality I can pursue?

33:14.826 --> 33:16.411
That's why we're here.

33:16.411 --> 33:19.163
There aren't any.
That's the problem.

33:24.377 --> 33:26.004
What about you?

33:26.004 --> 33:27.672
You're the guy that likes
a big idea,

33:27.672 --> 33:29.674
that likes the grand gesture, right?

33:29.674 --> 33:31.676
Mm-hmm.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.845
So put a stop
to patent sharking.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.431
And these sharks
troll published patents

33:36.431 --> 33:38.141
and buy everything
that could credibly allege

33:38.141 --> 33:40.018
the invention
infringes on it.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.520
So they can sue.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.480
Did you know there is
a plasma substitute

33:44.480 --> 33:47.316
that could save soldiers' lives
wounded in theater?

33:47.316 --> 33:48.568
But the inventor
can't roll it out

33:48.568 --> 33:50.361
because she's surrounded
by sharks.

33:52.572 --> 33:55.241
That is a great injustice,

33:55.241 --> 33:58.036
but I can't change it.

34:00.288 --> 34:03.541
Nor can I change the fundamental
nature of the enterprise

34:03.541 --> 34:05.501
that is Michael Prince.

34:05.501 --> 34:07.128
Because your Dr. Ruloff,

34:07.128 --> 34:09.297
great man that you say he is,

34:09.297 --> 34:13.342
is actually just a harbor seal.

34:16.387 --> 34:18.514
And sharks will shark.

34:18.514 --> 34:21.559
Harbor seals
will harbor seal.

34:23.686 --> 34:26.439
That is the way of the ocean.

34:32.236 --> 34:35.490
Gather around,
you malingerers.

34:35.490 --> 34:37.366
First, we heard you.

34:37.366 --> 34:39.827
After this year,
with all the changes and drama,

34:39.827 --> 34:43.081
we will not proceed with
the planned performance review.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.875
It is more important that
instead of judging each other,

34:45.875 --> 34:47.752
we come together. So...

34:47.752 --> 34:49.670
we are going to have
the inaugural

34:49.670 --> 34:53.925
Michael Prince Capital
Casino Night at Gotham Hall.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.052
Everyone will be there.

34:58.679 --> 35:00.723
Because you have to be...

35:02.683 --> 35:04.602
and because
you fucking want to be.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.646
This group will
come together as a--

35:06.646 --> 35:08.189
Don't say "family."

35:08.189 --> 35:10.024
That whole
"work unit as family" thing

35:10.024 --> 35:12.068
really stamps you
as a Boomer.

35:12.068 --> 35:13.236
- Gen X.
- We're not Boomers.

35:13.236 --> 35:14.695
Not even close.

35:14.695 --> 35:15.988
We read Doug Coupland
in hardback.

35:15.988 --> 35:17.573
You did.
I'm much younger.

35:17.573 --> 35:20.201
The point is,
we will come together as a--

35:20.201 --> 35:22.829
Goddamned family,
or die trying.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.956
Wags, Scooter. Need you.

35:38.010 --> 35:39.929
Kate has an angle
on the Ruloff thing.

35:39.929 --> 35:41.264
I wanted you to hear it.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.640
We just set it in motion
an hour ago.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.475
Enzy-Novo, biotech firm.

35:44.475 --> 35:47.895
They create the bacterial enzyme
that Ruloff's process uses.

35:47.895 --> 35:50.815
And that, the enzyme,
it's proprietary, I imagine.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.484
As patented as Carla Fracci's
<i>Giselle.</i>

35:56.529 --> 35:59.031
As Jordan's turnaround fadeaway.

35:59.031 --> 36:00.491
- Ah.
- Yes, of course. Yeah.

36:00.491 --> 36:01.951
By buying
into this company

36:01.951 --> 36:03.661
and the underlying patent,

36:03.661 --> 36:05.538
Ruloff will be neutralized.

36:05.538 --> 36:08.374
Without Enzy-Novo, Ruloff is
just making everyday cement.

36:08.374 --> 36:11.085
It'll take him years to replace
or create his own bacteria.

36:11.085 --> 36:13.588
Mm, I'd love to see
Ruloff's face when he finds out

36:13.588 --> 36:16.048
he can't have the starter
for his concrete sourdough.

36:16.048 --> 36:17.800
So, that second,
when he's gut-punched,

36:17.800 --> 36:20.970
is when we go back to him
with our last and best offer?

36:20.970 --> 36:22.680
He'll sell whether
he wants to or not.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.515
He'll have to, because he'll
have no other choice.

36:24.515 --> 36:25.892
He'll end up grateful, Mike,

36:25.892 --> 36:27.351
when he sees what you do
with his idea.

36:27.351 --> 36:28.603
How you blow it out.

36:28.603 --> 36:29.979
And, knowing you,

36:29.979 --> 36:31.439
you'll be sure
to credit him, too.

36:31.439 --> 36:32.773
You know I will.

36:32.773 --> 36:34.150
But all those hugs
will have to wait

36:34.150 --> 36:35.318
for the other side
of the war.

36:40.907 --> 36:43.367
I have to sign off.
Who can become the host?

36:46.829 --> 36:48.539
Uh, he's in a meeting.

36:48.539 --> 36:50.708
I'll tell you and your
lawyer at the same time.

36:50.708 --> 36:53.544
Your attempted purchase
of Enzy-Novo has hit a snag,

36:53.544 --> 36:56.547
and that snag is named
this guy right here.

36:56.547 --> 36:59.508
I wouldn't dignify this,
I were you, Mike.

36:59.508 --> 37:01.886
I didn't hear some rumor
needs confirming.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.515
I'm in an exclusive negotiation
period with them,

37:06.515 --> 37:08.768
so they had to tell me as soon
as your offer floated in.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.353
Well, when your period ends,

37:10.353 --> 37:12.271
I'll be there
with a wheelbarrow full of cash.

37:12.271 --> 37:14.482
You won't outbid me.
I need it more.

37:14.482 --> 37:15.816
That's not something you admit
to a guy

37:15.816 --> 37:17.485
with unlimited resources.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.528
That's why you should do
the magnifying glass/slide stuff

37:19.528 --> 37:21.906
and leave the transactions
and wire transfers to me.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.325
I'll focus on the science
of kicking your ass.

37:24.325 --> 37:26.244
You want to get
into a buying war with me?

37:26.244 --> 37:28.120
You're firing a pea shooter
at a tank.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.623
Maybe I have
a tank of my own.

37:30.623 --> 37:34.210
You can go around
buying adjacent stuff.

37:34.210 --> 37:35.753
Meanwhile,
I'll publish my work.

37:35.753 --> 37:38.923
Acclaim, prizes,
media attention will follow.

37:38.923 --> 37:44.053
I'll be the man credited with
rebuilding the world, not you.

37:52.436 --> 37:53.938
Philip...

37:57.149 --> 37:59.193
if this guy has
a vulnerability, a weakness,

37:59.193 --> 38:02.280
a quirk of character
that we can use against him,

38:02.280 --> 38:03.864
now would be
the time to share it.

38:04.991 --> 38:06.534
I'd love to help,

38:06.534 --> 38:08.244
but I've got nothing
to help with.

38:08.244 --> 38:09.912
I was an admiring student.

38:09.912 --> 38:12.331
I've never seen that contentious
side of him before.

38:12.331 --> 38:14.500
I've known him as nice. Conscientious.

38:14.500 --> 38:17.295
I don't know how to get inside
his head and turn him around.

38:23.509 --> 38:26.095
He's a process guy.

38:26.095 --> 38:29.515
He had a 1966 emerald-green
Karmann Ghia 1300.

38:29.515 --> 38:30.933
He loved that car.

38:30.933 --> 38:32.935
Talked about
how the Karmann Ghia 1300

38:32.935 --> 38:35.187
was made for the road.

38:35.187 --> 38:36.981
They weren't durable cars,

38:36.981 --> 38:39.692
so sometimes
you'd see them in garages.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.193
That really bothers him,

38:41.193 --> 38:43.070
the thought that it might
happen to his.

38:43.070 --> 38:45.114
So he bought an entirely
different Karmann Ghia

38:45.114 --> 38:47.366
and stripped it for parts
to save the green one.

38:47.366 --> 38:48.993
Had someone
in the engineering school

38:48.993 --> 38:50.244
match the paint perfectly.

38:50.244 --> 38:52.121
So he's an obsessive.

38:52.121 --> 38:54.582
I'd put it slightly differently.

38:55.958 --> 38:58.085
He's a man
who follows his passion.

38:58.085 --> 39:00.880
Who builds something
and then takes care of it.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.631
That's where
this is coming from.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.800
I mean, he used to take that car
out to these rallies

39:04.800 --> 39:07.511
with whales from
the Stanford Board of Trustees.

39:07.511 --> 39:08.971
They used to try
and buy it off him,

39:08.971 --> 39:10.723
but he wouldn't sell.

39:10.723 --> 39:13.893
The smile on his face
when he would drive off in it...

39:13.893 --> 39:16.645
pure joy of someone who loved
something enough

39:16.645 --> 39:19.648
to take care of it in a way
that it served him perfectly.

39:19.648 --> 39:21.150
Good. Good. Yeah.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.902
That's just the story
I needed to hear.

39:22.902 --> 39:25.321
Kate, I'm betting
Ruloff cozied up

39:25.321 --> 39:27.573
to some billie board member
of the university

39:27.573 --> 39:29.283
to back his war against me.

39:29.283 --> 39:30.534
We still need to outbid him.

39:30.534 --> 39:32.078
Well, what if we can't?

39:32.078 --> 39:34.246
Yes, if he did get himself
a bigger tank,

39:34.246 --> 39:35.956
that might be the case.

39:35.956 --> 39:37.917
So we sue for injunctive relief

39:37.917 --> 39:39.543
on behalf of one
of our other patents.

39:39.543 --> 39:41.921
We won't win that,
which you obviously know.

39:41.921 --> 39:43.172
Winning won't matter.

39:43.172 --> 39:45.049
As Philip's story tells us,

39:45.049 --> 39:47.510
Ruloff will sacrifice everything
but the central project,

39:47.510 --> 39:49.095
the central idea.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.431
He'd cannibalize
perfectly good cars

39:52.431 --> 39:54.266
just to keep his on the road.

39:54.266 --> 39:56.894
It was the getting it on the
road that was everything to him.

39:56.894 --> 39:58.479
Still is.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.147
If we can keep him in court,

40:00.147 --> 40:02.149
and his prize Karmann Ghia
in the garage,

40:02.149 --> 40:05.319
it'll drive him crazy enough to
share the Karmann Ghia with us,

40:05.319 --> 40:07.571
as long as it gets it moving.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.242
That tracks.

40:14.578 --> 40:15.913
I know what to do.

40:35.099 --> 40:39.437
A hearty welcome to all of you
gamesters, sports, speculators,

40:39.437 --> 40:41.272
pikers, and punters.

40:41.272 --> 40:43.732
Tonight, we offer you the chance
to test your luck

40:43.732 --> 40:47.069
and skill at roulette,
blackjack, craps,

40:47.069 --> 40:49.780
baccarat and Texas Hold 'Em.

40:49.780 --> 40:53.451
Drinks are free, and everyone
starts with 5,000 in chips,

40:53.451 --> 40:56.245
with unlimited rebuys
at your own expense.

40:56.245 --> 40:57.913
Proceeds go to charity,
of course,

40:57.913 --> 41:00.416
but the chip leader
at the end of the night

41:00.416 --> 41:03.294
wins a special prize.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.963
And what a prize it is.

41:05.963 --> 41:08.966
Private air travel and
all expenses paid to Ireland,

41:08.966 --> 41:10.468
to coincide with the Open.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.888
And VIP rounds
with this year's champion

41:13.888 --> 41:18.642
at Royal County Down, Portrush,
Sligo, and Ballybunion.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.311
Release the hounds!

41:32.323 --> 41:34.158
Odd numbers only.

41:34.158 --> 41:37.161
7, 17, 23, 24.

41:37.161 --> 41:39.038
Let's go.

41:39.038 --> 41:40.831
<i>I know where you're going</i>

41:40.831 --> 41:42.958
<i>I don't think
That's acting right</i>

41:42.958 --> 41:46.337
<i>You don't think
It's showing</i>

42:03.062 --> 42:04.647
Split 'em.

42:11.403 --> 42:13.030
Split.

42:13.030 --> 42:16.617
<i>Falling down
Don't misunderstand me</i>

42:16.617 --> 42:19.161
<i>You don't think
I know your plan?</i>

42:19.161 --> 42:21.080
Again?

42:43.269 --> 42:44.562
Gonna raise.

42:52.236 --> 42:53.904
Point is 9.

42:53.904 --> 42:56.156
I'm backing up mine.

42:57.324 --> 42:59.577
And give me
all the hard ways.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.620
Backing up mine.

43:01.620 --> 43:04.206
You're wrong-way betting me.

43:04.206 --> 43:06.417
Your future
is in your hand.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.377
Damn right it is.

43:10.671 --> 43:11.880
Rebuy.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.215
Already?

43:13.215 --> 43:15.759
Don't worry.
I have a system.

43:19.805 --> 43:21.348
Do you take Venmo?

43:23.225 --> 43:24.685
There we go!

43:27.563 --> 43:29.523
All right,
let's bet some columns.

43:36.822 --> 43:39.241
- Seven.
- Oh!

43:39.241 --> 43:42.244
Ah-ha. Mama's got
a brand-new bag.

43:42.244 --> 43:43.412
Fuck!

43:43.412 --> 43:45.039
You gooched me.

43:45.039 --> 43:46.749
Well, sometimes
that's what mamas have to do

43:46.749 --> 43:48.417
to get the brand-new bag.

43:49.960 --> 43:52.296
That is the sound
of success.

43:52.296 --> 43:54.882
Tonight's a hit.
A palpable hit.

43:56.967 --> 43:59.511
While you do your thing,
I am going to visit the tables.

43:59.511 --> 44:01.221
- Baccarat?
- I know it's house odds,

44:01.221 --> 44:02.765
but I've been a sucker for it

44:02.765 --> 44:04.850
ever since the original
<i>Casino Royale.</i>

44:11.231 --> 44:13.859
Mm! Grey Goose martini. Shaken.

44:13.859 --> 44:16.612
Or stirred.
I don't really give a shit.

44:16.612 --> 44:19.531
Ah, yes, <i>chemin de fer.</i>

44:19.531 --> 44:22.701
Or as you vulgarians
like to call it, baccarat.

44:22.701 --> 44:25.120
I usually play with tiles,
but this will have to do.

44:27.456 --> 44:29.333
<i>Mm!</i>

44:29.333 --> 44:31.085
<i>Banco!</i>

44:31.085 --> 44:33.170
Vanessa.

44:33.170 --> 44:35.172
- What do we got?
- Oh, we've got it all.

44:41.178 --> 44:42.930
So, most of these folks,

44:42.930 --> 44:45.683
the abstraction of having
chips instead of cards,

44:45.683 --> 44:48.435
it's throwing their sense
of value off instantly.

44:48.435 --> 44:50.020
Break it down for me.

44:50.020 --> 44:52.272
Okay.

44:52.272 --> 44:55.609
This guy Victor, he's over there
rolling it up at roulette.

44:55.609 --> 44:57.861
Aggressive, but smart.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.739
On the other hand,

45:00.739 --> 45:02.950
Tuk Lal's already made his
third visit to the rebuy cage.

45:02.950 --> 45:05.828
He seems to think he has some
sort of system at blackjack.

45:05.828 --> 45:07.204
I don't know.

45:08.288 --> 45:09.665
His buddy Ben Kim over there...

45:11.250 --> 45:13.085
he's squeezing
his original 5K in chips

45:13.085 --> 45:15.212
hard enough to turn them
into diamonds.

45:15.212 --> 45:17.506
But scared money's
not gonna win tonight.

45:18.757 --> 45:20.259
Taylor Mason,

45:20.259 --> 45:23.262
clearly a high-level
thinking poker player,

45:23.262 --> 45:26.515
is crushing everybody
at Texas Hold 'Em.

45:26.515 --> 45:28.976
And over here, the one
they're calling Dollar Bill,

45:28.976 --> 45:31.729
he's a total nihilist
at the craps table.

45:33.105 --> 45:35.607
Keep going. Deep dive.

45:38.569 --> 45:42.698
Tell me how their behavior here
transfers to the workplace.

45:42.698 --> 45:45.367
So, Ruloff,

45:45.367 --> 45:46.910
far from letting himself
be sharked,

45:46.910 --> 45:49.413
got a killer whale
to protect him,

45:49.413 --> 45:50.748
but it ain't working.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.249
Or it was working so well

45:52.249 --> 45:53.834
that Prince had to come at him
another way

45:53.834 --> 45:55.377
to strike the fatal blow.

45:55.377 --> 45:57.087
Uh-huh. What was the move?

45:57.087 --> 45:59.465
Filed suit to block
Ruloff's purchase of Enzy-Novo.

45:59.465 --> 46:02.176
In California. It's gonna end up
in the 9th Circuit.

46:02.176 --> 46:03.802
Where it'll be years
before it's settled out.

46:03.802 --> 46:05.262
These two are gonna be like

46:05.262 --> 46:07.264
the Lazarus A and Lazarus B
on <i>Trek.</i>

46:07.264 --> 46:08.724
Fighting into eternity.

46:08.724 --> 46:11.059
I don't like it.

46:11.059 --> 46:13.645
Neither one of these guys
should be spending their time

46:13.645 --> 46:16.523
trying to win at all costs.

46:16.523 --> 46:18.901
If this thing is as good for
the world as it promises to be,

46:18.901 --> 46:21.153
they should only be focused
on bringing it out.

46:21.153 --> 46:22.863
And worry about the money,

46:22.863 --> 46:25.657
of which there will be plenty, later.

46:25.657 --> 46:27.201
I mean, think about it.

46:27.201 --> 46:29.036
Louis Pasteur's
first order of business

46:29.036 --> 46:30.454
was doing the good thing,

46:30.454 --> 46:32.206
not cashing in
on his breakthroughs

46:32.206 --> 46:34.917
like these two brigands.

46:34.917 --> 46:38.504
No single person should control
something like this.

46:39.505 --> 46:40.964
There's got to be a way

46:40.964 --> 46:42.633
to take them both
out of the equation.

46:43.926 --> 46:46.053
Unless the whole thing
is a setup.

46:47.846 --> 46:50.641
Wendy comes to you,
you go to the kid,

46:50.641 --> 46:52.601
he gets you
to swallow the poison,

46:52.601 --> 46:53.936
thinking it's just wine.

46:53.936 --> 46:55.938
Oh, Wendy and I aren't
out there

46:55.938 --> 46:59.149
in that particular bad place,
in that particular way.

46:59.149 --> 47:02.152
And, I mean, if we are,
give me the poison now.

47:02.152 --> 47:03.445
Get it over with.

47:03.445 --> 47:04.696
Or just be careful.

47:04.696 --> 47:06.073
How come he didn't make a move

47:06.073 --> 47:07.324
to stop things on his own?

47:07.324 --> 47:08.784
His move was reaching me.

47:08.784 --> 47:10.619
What else could he do
on the inside?

47:10.619 --> 47:12.955
Well, just play it out.

47:12.955 --> 47:15.123
Don't drink whatever goblet's
put in front of you.

47:15.123 --> 47:17.334
And then it doesn't matter
what's inside it.

47:17.334 --> 47:19.044
Fine. Yes.

47:19.044 --> 47:21.004
We proceed without allowing
any kind of opening,

47:21.004 --> 47:22.256
as we always do.

47:22.256 --> 47:24.550
But proceed we must.

47:24.550 --> 47:26.301
How do we get it done?

47:27.553 --> 47:29.221
The only word
that comes to mind:

47:30.764 --> 47:32.474
Spielbergian.

47:35.310 --> 47:36.728
Is that a word?

47:36.728 --> 47:38.230
It ought to be.

47:43.193 --> 47:45.362
I just got a nasty text
from Marc Ruloff.

47:45.362 --> 47:46.780
That's 'cause it's over.

47:46.780 --> 47:48.031
You blocked him
and beat him?

47:48.031 --> 47:49.283
Nope.

47:49.283 --> 47:51.285
But it's over all the same.

47:51.285 --> 47:53.745
The Department of Defense
did a march-in.

47:55.664 --> 47:57.791
<i>The entire project
was declared classified</i>

47:57.791 --> 47:59.042
<i>by the federal government.</i>

48:01.086 --> 48:02.754
Your patent,
everything in this office,

48:02.754 --> 48:04.423
and everything
associated with this work

48:04.423 --> 48:06.216
will now be controlled
by the federal government.

48:06.216 --> 48:08.760
You have rights,
and there is a process

48:08.760 --> 48:11.680
which will now be overseen
by the Department of Defense.

48:13.181 --> 48:15.017
You dropped the dime
to the government?

48:15.017 --> 48:17.227
Could he have
tipped them off himself?

48:17.227 --> 48:18.812
Killed it instead
of letting you have it?

48:18.812 --> 48:21.189
Don't think so.
Doesn't matter now.

48:21.189 --> 48:23.066
The government
will sit on this discovery

48:23.066 --> 48:25.694
like the Ark of the Covenant
in that endless warehouse.

48:25.694 --> 48:27.237
Why won't they get it
into the market?

48:27.237 --> 48:28.947
Well, first of all,
they're inept.

48:28.947 --> 48:30.741
Then, you know,
think of the special interests.

48:30.741 --> 48:32.117
The unions.
The conflicts.

48:32.117 --> 48:34.494
Yeah. They'll use
potential unknown

48:34.494 --> 48:36.163
health or structural liabilities

48:36.163 --> 48:37.873
to get the government
to keep testing it.

48:37.873 --> 48:39.625
Yeah, so, no.
It's not coming to market.

48:39.625 --> 48:40.876
Not now.

48:40.876 --> 48:42.461
So no one gets the benefit.

48:44.004 --> 48:45.464
It's like everyone
just literally said,

48:45.464 --> 48:47.507
"Fine,
kill the damned infant."

48:47.507 --> 48:50.010
Well, the upside is that
when I take the oath of office

48:50.010 --> 48:53.263
and I do declassify it
and release it,

48:53.263 --> 48:56.391
it'll start us off very,
very nicely.

48:56.391 --> 48:59.269
you hold
until right after

48:59.269 --> 49:01.355
you announce
for a second term.

49:01.355 --> 49:04.066
Eight years in office
for President Prince locked up.

49:04.066 --> 49:05.901
Ooh, I like that a lot.

49:05.901 --> 49:09.112
Hold it, then splash.

49:12.908 --> 49:15.702
Maybe Ruloff did me a favor
by trying to stop me.

49:37.307 --> 49:40.227
Let me go over your debt, find
you some corridors out of this.

49:40.227 --> 49:42.229
I think...

49:42.229 --> 49:45.023
No. You've done enough.

49:46.233 --> 49:48.485
More than enough.

49:48.485 --> 49:51.279
Our engagement ends
when you walk out that door.

49:51.279 --> 49:54.658
Before I do, I just want you
to know that my intentions--

49:54.658 --> 49:56.618
I misspoke.

49:56.618 --> 49:58.495
Our engagement ends now.

50:19.224 --> 50:21.518
We're here to set the terms
for the performance reviews.

50:21.518 --> 50:24.187
Should we wait until Philip
is here before we start?

50:24.187 --> 50:25.689
He's not coming.

50:25.689 --> 50:27.190
Oh, well,

50:27.190 --> 50:30.986
there is a new harmonious spirit
on the floor.

50:30.986 --> 50:32.362
We think there's
a road to compromise

50:32.362 --> 50:34.156
that you'll find productive.

50:34.156 --> 50:35.741
It's irrelevant at this point.
We have what we need.

50:35.741 --> 50:37.367
How's that?

50:37.367 --> 50:40.203
You all said nothing
but told us everything.

50:40.203 --> 50:43.040
I've taken Vanessa Selbst's
raw research

50:43.040 --> 50:45.208
and put it into language
that discloses

50:45.208 --> 50:48.712
what the usual comp process
does, and much more.

50:48.712 --> 50:51.214
Using prospect theory,

50:51.214 --> 50:53.258
as based on
Kahneman and Tversky's

50:53.258 --> 50:55.844
Nobel Prize-winning research
recognizing loss aversion

50:55.844 --> 50:59.056
that veers directly
into sunk cost fallacy...

51:01.308 --> 51:03.977
along with many other
related pathologies

51:03.977 --> 51:05.562
that were revealed
the other night...

51:07.773 --> 51:09.483
the participation
of the employees

51:09.483 --> 51:10.817
is no longer required.

51:10.817 --> 51:12.694
Shit.

51:12.694 --> 51:16.656
Casino Night wasn't
some team-building exercise.

51:16.656 --> 51:19.159
It was an observation chamber.

51:20.452 --> 51:22.412
Yes, we already know
what we need to know

51:22.412 --> 51:24.247
in order to gauge the employees'
risk assessment,

51:24.247 --> 51:25.832
strategic approach,
expected outcome,

51:25.832 --> 51:27.084
performance in general.

51:27.084 --> 51:28.335
Thanks for your time.

51:28.335 --> 51:30.045
Son of a bitch.

51:30.045 --> 51:32.214
What's next,
the Milgram experiment?

51:32.214 --> 51:35.801
You want to see if we'll
join in shocking each other?

51:38.470 --> 51:41.473
Oh, who was the winner
of the big prize?

51:41.473 --> 51:43.141
Peach took it down.

51:43.141 --> 51:44.601
Fuck me.

51:44.601 --> 51:46.728
- Wow, wow, wow.
- Does she even golf?

51:46.728 --> 51:48.897
I hear she's about to flip it
to a PM at another firm

51:48.897 --> 51:50.565
for 300 grand.

51:54.653 --> 51:56.279
Shame they're so upset.

51:56.279 --> 51:58.573
Victor and Rian had
some of the best approaches.

51:58.573 --> 52:00.408
Unlike the bulk of those losers.

52:01.409 --> 52:03.286
Including you, Wags.

52:03.286 --> 52:05.288
You were in on the gag,
and yet you bled off

52:05.288 --> 52:07.457
$4,900 in chips at baccarat.

52:07.457 --> 52:09.042
Me?

52:09.042 --> 52:11.294
I thought I was on the inside,
that I'm exempt.

52:12.337 --> 52:13.964
Oh, no.

52:13.964 --> 52:15.757
No one's exempt.

52:15.757 --> 52:17.884
Goddamn it.

52:17.884 --> 52:20.137
Scooter, you're definitely
not getting invited

52:20.137 --> 52:21.638
to mini golf next week.

52:22.681 --> 52:24.057
None of you are.

52:28.478 --> 52:30.814
Everything I did
went to shit.

52:30.814 --> 52:32.649
I tried to run
a performance review,

52:32.649 --> 52:35.443
and it turned into
a psychological study.

52:35.443 --> 52:37.404
I tried to help the firm
and ended up with nothing.

52:37.404 --> 52:40.574
I tried to help my old teacher,
he lost everything.

52:42.033 --> 52:43.994
I hoped to change the world,
it went nowhere.

52:43.994 --> 52:46.079
You're giving yourself
a lot of credit

52:46.079 --> 52:48.331
for how much
you supposedly control.

52:53.545 --> 52:55.088
No, you're right.

52:56.047 --> 52:57.382
I should give you some.

52:59.843 --> 53:01.803
Because when I went to you
and your ex-husband,

53:01.803 --> 53:04.181
that's when the crap
really started flowing downhill.

53:06.516 --> 53:09.394
Instead of handing out
the kudos and the blame,

53:09.394 --> 53:13.356
why don't we talk about
turning this mess into action.

53:15.400 --> 53:16.735
Because I saw you
in his office,

53:16.735 --> 53:18.361
and I know how you feel.

53:18.361 --> 53:20.572
Whatever plan you're
considering, leave me out.

53:20.572 --> 53:22.532
Whatever you, and Taylor,
and I don't know who else

53:22.532 --> 53:23.867
are thinking about doing...

53:27.829 --> 53:29.539
I can't.

53:29.539 --> 53:31.708
Won't. I don't even want to.

53:31.708 --> 53:34.461
I need, and I will have,
complete deniability.

53:34.461 --> 53:36.713
As-is, right now, there is
nothing I could tell anyone,

53:36.713 --> 53:38.506
nothing I should tell anyone.

53:38.506 --> 53:39.966
I aim to keep it that way.

53:42.594 --> 53:44.596
Then you do that.

54:01.071 --> 54:03.114
You have an old friend
at Defense, don't you?

54:04.407 --> 54:06.076
Did you talk to him lately?

54:06.076 --> 54:10.997
Maybe ask him to, well,
classify something

54:10.997 --> 54:13.250
that could really help
the country,

54:13.250 --> 54:15.377
just to screw over a rival?

54:17.671 --> 54:21.049
If my actions hurt the man,
that is the way it is.

54:22.300 --> 54:24.386
I presume he intends
to declassify it,

54:24.386 --> 54:26.721
if and when
he gets into office.

54:26.721 --> 54:30.308
But I can keep
the wolf at bay for now.

54:31.643 --> 54:33.603
See how that works out.

54:35.063 --> 54:37.107
Right.

54:38.400 --> 54:40.110
A lot of ways
this could have gone

54:40.110 --> 54:42.696
once you connected me
with that fella Philip Charyn.

54:42.696 --> 54:45.448
But then you knew that.

54:48.326 --> 54:50.620
Yep. I suppose I did.

54:58.003 --> 54:59.921
Well, some things
turn out just fine.

54:59.921 --> 55:01.589
Yes, they do.
A lot of things.

55:03.008 --> 55:04.926
<i>Smack, crack, bushwhacked</i>

55:04.926 --> 55:06.761
<i>- Tie another one
- Congratulations.</i>

55:06.761 --> 55:09.347
<i>To your racks, baby</i>

55:09.347 --> 55:11.433
- So proud of you.
- Thank you.

55:12.475 --> 55:14.102
Nice. Good job.

55:15.353 --> 55:18.857
<i>Hey, kids, rock and roll</i>

55:18.857 --> 55:23.695
<i>Nobody tells you
Where to go, baby</i>

55:28.950 --> 55:32.329
<i>What if I ride?
What if you walk?</i>

55:32.329 --> 55:35.832
<i>What if you rock
Around the clock?</i>

55:35.832 --> 55:38.251
<i>Tick-tock</i>

55:39.294 --> 55:42.589
<i>Tick-tock</i>

55:42.589 --> 55:45.925
<i>What if you did?
What if you walk?</i>

55:45.925 --> 55:50.680
<i>What if you tried
To get off, baby?</i>

55:51.681 --> 55:53.516
<i>Oh</i>
