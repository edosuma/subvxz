This is Seven David Five,

01:04.964 --> 01:08.331
responding to a 10-11,
149th and Cordova.

01:08.435 --> 01:10.767
Copy that, Seven David Five.

01:25.185 --> 01:27.278
Open up, police!.

01:28.888 --> 01:31.015
Let's go!. Open up!.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.065
Ma'am, we've had some complaints
about the noise.

01:39.165 --> 01:41.133
We want no trouble.

01:41.234 --> 01:43.668
Then you don't mind
if we come in?

01:43.770 --> 01:45.169
No.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.070
You folks want to tell me
what's going on?

01:51.978 --> 01:56.415
We have trouble early tonight,
but no trouble now.

01:59.152 --> 02:01.518
Please... You go.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.685
We have no trouble.

02:06.226 --> 02:07.386
It's okay.

02:08.862 --> 02:12.354
Ma'am, I'm going to enter this room.
Please, step aside.

02:13.967 --> 02:14.956
Please...

02:16.269 --> 02:18.328
Relax, it'll be fine.

02:21.407 --> 02:23.875
Russo!. We need backup!.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.138
Seven David Five,
requesting backup on that 10-11.

02:26.246 --> 02:27.907
Copy that, Seven David Five.

02:30.884 --> 02:33.512
Seven David Five EMT, stat.

02:51.871 --> 02:53.031
It's a kid.

02:54.407 --> 02:56.272
Hey, kid, you okay?

02:59.312 --> 03:02.804
It's okay. I'm just going
to come over to you real slow,

03:02.916 --> 03:05.476
and I'm going to reach out
and grab my hand, okay?

03:05.585 --> 03:11.490
No, come on, it's okay. You're okay.
Just reach out. Come on.

03:11.591 --> 03:15.322
No, come on. It's okay. Come on,
I need you to just take my hand.

03:16.496 --> 03:17.394
I said come here!.

03:38.585 --> 03:41.179
Oh, God...

03:44.891 --> 03:47.883
- Um, excuse me?
- Hey, is everything good?

03:47.994 --> 03:52.226
Well, yeah, it's great.
It's delicious, but, um...

03:52.332 --> 03:54.027
Is it the chef's night off?

03:54.133 --> 03:56.829
Uh, actually, yeah.

03:56.936 --> 03:58.335
Is something wrong?

03:58.438 --> 04:04.240
No, no, it's just that the balsamic
drizzle is counter-clockwise

04:04.344 --> 04:06.039
instead of clockwise.

04:06.145 --> 04:06.804
Oh.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.875
Not that it matters.
It's just that, uh... Hold on.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.093
May I?

04:30.970 --> 04:33.700
Damn.

04:33.806 --> 04:34.465
Thanks.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.643
- It's part of the job.
- He's here.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.945
You're too late, Zimmerman.

04:46.052 --> 04:47.952
Yeah, I was at dinner.

04:48.054 --> 04:51.387
- Well, we got our guy.
- No kidding?

04:51.491 --> 04:53.550
Wow, that's great.
Really great.

04:53.660 --> 04:56.185
Two of our own, huh?

04:56.296 --> 04:58.958
- Do their families know?
- It's covered.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.601
As long as I'm here, you mind
if I take a look around?

05:04.971 --> 05:06.802
Sure, whatever.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.818
A lot of people
living in one apartment.

05:26.726 --> 05:27.784
Five?

05:27.894 --> 05:31.261
Four, including the third DB.
An old man.

05:36.736 --> 05:38.567
Religious people.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.838
Ukrainian or Russian?

05:46.212 --> 05:47.736
Russian.

05:49.549 --> 05:52.211
- And just the one kid?
- No, no kids.

05:57.256 --> 05:59.690
Hyperactive.

05:59.792 --> 06:01.225
Fidgety.

06:02.829 --> 06:04.922
These scratches are pretty fresh.

06:05.031 --> 06:05.929
What the hell's he talking about?

06:06.032 --> 06:07.795
Yeah, we got the shooter,
Zimmerman.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.925
He's at the hospital with one
of our eyewitnesses.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.298
Huh...

06:38.431 --> 06:41.696
Guy's a forensic shrink.
Thinks he's Sherlock Holmes.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.666
I heard the agency
gave him the boot.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.762
Yeah, now he's all ours.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.966
Better go keep an eye on him.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.720
Night sweats.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.295
A lot of fear in the air.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.963
Borscht, too, but...
Mainly fear.

07:17.069 --> 07:21.165
Gee, maybe it has something to do
with the triple homicide.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.742
No, I mean before that.

07:25.278 --> 07:29.374
Deadbolt on the bedroom door.

07:29.482 --> 07:31.575
It locks from the outside.

07:31.684 --> 07:33.879
And these shades are never up,

07:33.986 --> 07:36.284
but they're not trying to hide
their heritage.

07:36.389 --> 07:40.052
- They're not illegals, right?
- That's right.

07:40.159 --> 07:42.024
So what are they hiding?

07:42.128 --> 07:44.562
What part of "we got the shooter"
don't you understand?

07:46.265 --> 07:47.698
I'm thinking there was no shooting.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.860
I don't need ballistics
to recognize the damage

07:50.970 --> 07:54.872
of close-range small caliber,
and we got eyewitnesses.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.908
Or weren't you listening
to that part?

07:57.009 --> 08:02.037
Couple things don't jibe.
Multidirectional cast-off on the walls.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.345
It's from
a blunt implement, maybe.

08:05.451 --> 08:06.748
Five people
in one small apartment.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.946
Space is precious,
but one drawer's empty?

08:09.055 --> 08:10.352
I told you, four people.

08:10.456 --> 08:12.924
Another drawer's got a comic
book hidden under the clothes.

08:13.025 --> 08:16.984
- So what?
- Well, it's not as if it's porn.

08:18.798 --> 08:22.495
Then there's, why were all four adults
sleeping in the living room?

08:24.670 --> 08:28.538
No, something else is going on here
that we haven't accounted for.

08:30.576 --> 08:32.168
And what the hell's that
supposed to mean?

08:34.914 --> 08:36.541
I don't know.

09:26.365 --> 09:26.956
Hey!.

09:30.970 --> 09:33.029
Hey, wait a second!

09:38.778 --> 09:40.507
Whoa, hey!

09:52.491 --> 09:54.584
This is getting weird.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.276
Not the way I'd hoped we'd meet.

10:17.550 --> 10:20.917
Will?
Stay where you are...

10:22.922 --> 10:23.980
Mommy!

10:24.991 --> 10:26.253
Mommy!

10:47.480 --> 10:50.449
You okay, Sherlock?
We found you out cold.

10:50.549 --> 10:54.280
- Yeah. A little bit sore.
- Let me guess.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.947
You got decked
by a hyperactive kid.

10:58.257 --> 11:02.489
No, somebody coming down the alley
clipped me and kept going.

11:03.896 --> 11:05.295
Well, soon as you're up to it,

11:05.398 --> 11:06.490
Cavanaugh wants
to see you upstairs.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.123
Witness I.D.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.277
I'll be a couple of hours.

11:36.662 --> 11:39.130
Yeah, we got our
eyewitness right here at the hospital.

11:39.231 --> 11:42.962
Yeah, a Mrs. Lutrova,
daughter of vic number one.

11:43.069 --> 11:46.800
Absolutely. By the book.
I'm looking at our guy right now.

11:46.906 --> 11:50.899
Yes, sir. As soon as we get
a positive ID, I'll let you know.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.979
Not a word to the press
without your say so, I understand.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.741
Okay, bye.

11:55.848 --> 11:58.578
WILL: Joe.

11:58.684 --> 12:00.879
What the hell happened to you?

12:00.986 --> 12:02.954
Car versus idiot.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.250
- I was the, uh...
- Right, yeah.

12:05.357 --> 12:08.053
Well, bad night all around,
I guess, huh?

12:08.160 --> 12:10.890
Who's your man?

12:10.996 --> 12:11.963
Vern Kovacs.

12:12.765 --> 12:14.960
Apartment two floors
below our crime scene.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.762
He's got a whole list
of priors there.

12:16.869 --> 12:21.363
Just got paroled after doing a dime
for armed robbery, rape, and assault.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.443
You'd think
he'd eliminate the witnesses.

12:26.545 --> 12:29.309
I mean, after three,
what's the downside?

12:29.415 --> 12:32.213
Come on. Chances are he wasn't
doing a lot of thinking.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.149
- Do you have a motive?
- Yes, I do.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.483
I'm trying to solve this case.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.580
Mrs. Lutrova? Come in.

12:39.391 --> 12:40.756
Now, this is Dr. Zimmerman.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.590
He is a forensic psychiatrist
attached to homicide.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.128
I'm very sorry for your loss.

12:48.134 --> 12:52.867
Now, ma'am, do you see the man
who murdered your father

12:52.972 --> 12:55.600
and those police officers tonight?

13:02.181 --> 13:02.909
Now, take your time,

13:03.015 --> 13:06.007
because we need you to be sure
about this, alright?

13:22.735 --> 13:25.363
He is the one.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.904
He killed them.

13:27.773 --> 13:29.468
You're certain?

13:29.575 --> 13:32.009
His face I could never forget.

13:32.111 --> 13:33.976
Okay, alright.
Well, that's good for now.

13:34.079 --> 13:38.709
Um, again, ma'am, my condolences
for your loss tonight.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.217
Ma'am.

13:42.087 --> 13:43.384
- Thank you, God.
- Joe, listen to me -

13:43.489 --> 13:44.820
No, just give me a second here.

13:44.924 --> 13:47.620
Tracy, yeah, I need to talk
to the D.A.'s office right away.

13:47.726 --> 13:48.852
Hey.

14:02.074 --> 14:04.008
Hey, Fets.

14:04.109 --> 14:06.077
I need five minutes with her.

14:06.178 --> 14:09.079
- Later, Doc, I'm taking her home.
- No, no, now.

14:10.049 --> 14:12.711
Mrs. Lutrova, I realize that you've
been through a lot tonight,

14:12.818 --> 14:15.787
but you and I both know
that you just lied in there.

14:15.888 --> 14:18.448
Body language. Averting your gaze.
Hands to your face.

14:18.557 --> 14:20.218
Rising vocal pitch.

14:20.326 --> 14:23.261
You'd never seen that man before
in your life, had you?

14:23.362 --> 14:24.761
I don't know what you say.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.162
And you felt no guilt about it.

14:29.735 --> 14:33.466
I do what's right.
You leave me alone now.

14:33.572 --> 14:36.803
I was at your building tonight
when everything happened.

14:36.909 --> 14:39.605
I saw a kid coming from your
apartment. Maybe 10 years old.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.146
There is no boy. No.

14:42.248 --> 14:43.715
I never said it was a boy.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.876
Enough bad thing happen tonight.
You leave me alone now.

14:46.986 --> 14:50.683
- Mrs. Lutrova, please -
- You stop. I go home.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.691
- Fresh meat coming through!
- Subtle.

15:04.803 --> 15:09.137
Russo, Albert and Birch, Lawrence.
Two cops. Bit it tonight uptown.

15:09.241 --> 15:12.108
Yeah, we've been expecting them.
Put them in holding.

15:12.211 --> 15:15.442
Got one more coming later.
EMS says it was a real butcher shop.

15:15.547 --> 15:17.606
Aren't they all these days?

15:19.919 --> 15:21.181
- Helen?
- Eleanor.

15:21.287 --> 15:22.879
- They're in the cold room.
- Thank you.

15:22.988 --> 15:24.421
- Lunch next week?
- Love to.

15:24.523 --> 15:25.353
I'll call.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.713
20 bucks?
I ain't giving it away, pal.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.978
Ain't you a drink of water?

16:53.078 --> 16:56.809
And I'm kind of thirsty.

16:56.915 --> 16:59.383
Is that so?

16:59.485 --> 17:02.886
I'm guessing you're looking
for a little action yourself.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.848
In fact,
I am looking for something.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.426
Perhaps you can help me.

17:10.996 --> 17:13.191
English, right?

17:13.298 --> 17:16.028
I've got a thing for the Brits.

17:16.135 --> 17:17.693
So polite and all.

17:18.670 --> 17:22.935
Well, this place,
it's rather strange.

17:23.041 --> 17:30.073
A sanctuary, and it takes in
only the most unusual guests.

17:32.484 --> 17:39.048
There's a big old place down
by the water, Grayson Street, I think.

17:39.158 --> 17:43.424
I've heard all kinds of stories,
but I never put much stock in them.

17:43.529 --> 17:47.932
I'll take you there, if you like,
but it'll cost you extra.

17:49.401 --> 17:52.928
How very kind of you.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.367
But I think I can find it
on my own.

18:52.164 --> 18:54.826
WILL:
The woman is lying. I'm sure of it.

18:54.933 --> 18:56.958
I don't know why we bother
interviewing eyewitnesses.

18:57.069 --> 19:00.232
I mean, you could just come in
and you could work that voodoo crap

19:00.339 --> 19:02.273
you've been working for the last
six months. It'd be great, right?

19:02.374 --> 19:04.808
That's what you think
of behavioral science?

19:04.910 --> 19:07.674
Two cops died tonight.

19:07.779 --> 19:10.043
Now, we owe it to these guys
to do right by them.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.743
Okay, okay, so what happens
when forensics comes back

19:12.851 --> 19:15.376
and says those weren't
bullet holes in their foreheads?

19:15.487 --> 19:16.681
Then Kovacs used something
else as a weapon.

19:16.788 --> 19:20.952
It doesn't change anything.

19:21.059 --> 19:24.051
So unless you've got something else,
something different...

19:28.867 --> 19:31.427
I saw something tonight.

19:31.537 --> 19:34.267
In the alley. It was a boy,
maybe 10 years old.

19:34.373 --> 19:37.342
It looked like he was running from
the crime scene, so I followed him,

19:37.442 --> 19:39.637
and I think the person who knocked
me down was following him, too.

19:39.745 --> 19:42.737
Well, none of the witnesses
mentioned a boy.

19:44.116 --> 19:47.347
I don't know. Something about him...
It was like...

19:47.452 --> 19:50.182
He wasn't just scared. It was like
he was in the grip of something.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.986
Right.

19:54.092 --> 19:58.586
So we have eyewitnesses,
a suspect with priors,

19:58.697 --> 20:00.927
but you, you like a 10-year-old kid
as the shooter?

20:01.033 --> 20:01.624
- No.
- Is that right?

20:01.733 --> 20:03.963
I'm just saying,
if you find the kid,

20:04.069 --> 20:06.299
then you'll know how
those three men died tonight.

20:06.405 --> 20:08.430
- Go home.
- Why don't you want to hear this?

20:08.540 --> 20:10.371
Because this is...

20:10.475 --> 20:12.500
Because this is exactly
the same kind of B.S.

20:12.611 --> 20:14.579
that got you bounced
from the agency.

20:14.680 --> 20:19.140
Now, I were you, I would just
back the hell off.

20:38.637 --> 20:41.333
The detective is right,
by the way.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.600
Excuse me?

20:42.708 --> 20:45.176
He can't use
anything you gave him.

20:45.277 --> 20:47.211
- Do I know you?
- How's your head?

20:49.414 --> 20:51.041
Wait...

20:51.149 --> 20:54.414
- You ran me over.
- You got in the way.

20:54.519 --> 20:57.317
- Of what?
- My pursuit of the boy.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.754
The police have the wrong man.

20:59.858 --> 21:00.916
The evidence will bear it out

21:01.026 --> 21:03.221
if they don't suppress it
for a quick conviction.

21:03.328 --> 21:06.786
But the boy is indeed real,
and he needs our help.

21:08.333 --> 21:09.197
Who are you?

21:09.301 --> 21:11.360
Let's just say I'm someone
who's chosen to embrace

21:11.470 --> 21:14.871
the full spectrum of our reality.

21:14.973 --> 21:17.942
There are things in this city -
in this world -

21:18.043 --> 21:20.341
that no one wants
to admit are real.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.811
Okay, you're creeping me out now.

21:22.914 --> 21:24.711
Dr. Zimmerman,

21:24.816 --> 21:30.982
have you ever asked yourself why
you lost your job at the agency?

21:31.089 --> 21:32.556
That's impressive.

21:32.658 --> 21:36.219
- What did you do, Google me?
- Your theories were controversial.

21:36.328 --> 21:37.352
You were headstrong.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.692
Your so-called failures
were really theirs.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.629
They failed to keep up
with your insights -

21:41.733 --> 21:44.702
Lady, I'm getting soaked here.
What do you want?

21:44.803 --> 21:47.738
You, Dr. Zimmerman.

21:47.839 --> 21:49.670
As I see it,
you have two choices.

21:49.775 --> 21:51.174
You can go back to a life

21:51.276 --> 21:55.576
where you're unheard
and unappreciated, or...

21:55.681 --> 21:57.308
...you can squarely face the truth

21:57.416 --> 21:59.884
you've been seeking
since you were a child.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.512
We both know you caught
a glimpse of that truth tonight.

22:04.122 --> 22:06.022
Don't turn away.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.154
Who are you?

22:17.436 --> 22:18.733
I have a proposal.

22:18.837 --> 22:22.603
All I ask is for a little
of your time.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.004
Thanks, but...

22:26.912 --> 22:29.380
If you're looking for resumes,
why don't you try monster. com?

22:31.016 --> 22:32.881
I already have a job.

22:38.523 --> 22:39.820
Hmm...

23:50.262 --> 23:53.823
- God, don't do that.
- You know I still have a key.

23:53.932 --> 23:57.527
Yeah, and you know how I love
these surprise visits.

23:58.837 --> 24:00.236
What are you doing here, Meg?

24:00.338 --> 24:03.330
I heard a couple cops got killed
at the precinct tonight.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.340
You okay?

24:05.444 --> 24:07.844
The usual.
Eating badly, sleeping worse.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.377
You?

24:11.616 --> 24:16.849
Just, you know...
Wanted to see if you were alright.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.759
And get the rest of my stuff.

24:35.674 --> 24:37.869
Is that everything?

24:37.976 --> 24:41.207
If you find my hair straightener,
you can bring it by the ICU.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.747
Hair straightener. Got it.

24:43.849 --> 24:47.649
It's kind of like returning
a high school ring or something.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.183
And the last two years of our lives
come down to a punch line.

24:51.289 --> 24:54.520
That wasn't...
Look, let's not do this, okay?

24:54.626 --> 24:58.084
I can't go 10 rounds tonight.
I just don't have it in me.

24:58.196 --> 25:00.494
They still riding you at work?

25:01.533 --> 25:02.795
Nothing I can't handle.

25:02.901 --> 25:05.768
Don't take this the wrong way, Will,
but you invite the ridicule.

25:05.871 --> 25:08.738
- Did you get the same invitation?
- That's not fair.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.900
Come on, Meg, you always
thought I was a wackjob, too.

25:12.010 --> 25:16.344
Look, whatever it is that finally
helps you sleep at night...

25:17.649 --> 25:18.843
...I hope you find it.

25:24.055 --> 25:26.546
- Goodbye, Will.
- Meg...

26:12.437 --> 26:13.870
Good evening.

26:13.972 --> 26:15.234
Hi.

26:19.844 --> 26:22.312
So what made you
decide to call?

26:22.414 --> 26:24.746
You said
you were pursuing the boy.

26:24.849 --> 26:27.283
- Indeed.
- Why?

26:27.385 --> 26:30.377
I suspect you know why.

26:31.656 --> 26:34.887
Uh, no. Honestly, I don't.

26:34.993 --> 26:37.052
Ah!

26:37.162 --> 26:40.757
Well, then, this will be a very
illuminating evening.

27:45.897 --> 27:47.592
Would you like a cup
of tea, Dr. Zimmerman?

27:47.699 --> 27:49.860
Or perhaps something stronger?

27:49.968 --> 27:52.994
Uh, no. No, thanks. I'm good.

27:53.104 --> 27:56.005
You no doubt have
questions about this place.

27:56.107 --> 27:59.372
Just one. How come there's
no organ music?

27:59.477 --> 28:02.674
I'm glad to see you maintain
a healthy sense of humor.

28:02.781 --> 28:05.249
Yeah, well, it's
invaluable in police work.

28:05.350 --> 28:08.319
Nothing brightens up a murder
scene like the right Zinger.

28:08.420 --> 28:12.584
Levity helps keep
far more insidious things at bay.

28:13.558 --> 28:14.547
The boy you saw.

28:14.659 --> 28:16.854
He's very special,
or so I was led to believe

28:16.961 --> 28:19.828
by people I've come to rely on
for such information.

28:19.931 --> 28:22.900
- Did he kill those men?
- Yes and no.

28:23.001 --> 28:25.834
Not the boy, per se.

28:27.405 --> 28:28.633
If the boy did do it,

28:28.740 --> 28:31.607
and you have knowledge
either way, I need to know.

28:31.710 --> 28:35.202
And if the answers I provide
pose even greater questions?

28:35.313 --> 28:38.510
- I'm willing to take that chance.
- Are you certain about that?

28:38.616 --> 28:40.311
You know what?

28:40.418 --> 28:42.249
Next time that you just
want some company,

28:42.353 --> 28:45.686
don't give your card out
to strangers on the street.

28:45.790 --> 28:49.282
By the time the night is out, I expect
to have the boy in my custody.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.884
Until then,
I hope you'll understand,

28:50.995 --> 28:53.623
but I'm reluctant to speculate
on his guilt or innocence.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.290
But you're saying
that you can find him?

28:55.400 --> 29:00.531
I believe so, and when I do,
I could use your help.

29:00.638 --> 29:02.572
Really?

29:02.674 --> 29:04.039
For what?

29:04.976 --> 29:07.706
You call this place a sanctuary.
For whom?

29:08.580 --> 29:10.207
Or "what. "

29:13.718 --> 29:16.653
Ah, you know what?
This was a really bad idea.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.450
I'm very sorry
to have wasted your time,

29:18.556 --> 29:21.389
and I'm even sorrier
that you've wasted mine.

29:23.161 --> 29:26.619
Your instincts told you that the boy
was anything but normal.

29:26.731 --> 29:28.665
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

29:30.068 --> 29:32.127
Inside these walls are beings

29:32.237 --> 29:34.603
that make his qualities
pale by comparison.

29:37.776 --> 29:41.507
"Sanctuary for all. "
It's not an empty motto.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.384
Damn sector gives me
the willies, man.

29:48.486 --> 29:52.752
No one likes working
under Old City. Place is toxic.

29:52.857 --> 29:55.325
Rent's cheap, though.

29:55.426 --> 29:56.825
Hold it.

30:00.265 --> 30:01.789
What the hell
you doing down here, kid?

30:04.903 --> 30:07.633
Look, wherever you ran from,
this place is worse, okay?

30:08.506 --> 30:09.939
So let's go.

30:10.708 --> 30:13.643
- Wasn't a request, kid.
- Wouldn't do that if I were you.

30:33.298 --> 30:34.856
Peachy.

30:40.738 --> 30:43.764
WILL: So you're a doctor
of what, exactly?

30:43.875 --> 30:47.538
The specific discipline
depends entirely on the patient.

30:47.645 --> 30:50.170
Do you have anything
for chronic insomnia?

30:50.982 --> 30:53.177
Fair warning, Dr. Zimmerman.

30:53.284 --> 30:56.048
You're about to leave
the world you know behind.

30:57.622 --> 30:59.249
I'll take that as a no.

31:03.428 --> 31:05.020
This way.

31:11.469 --> 31:14.700
I specialize mainly in cryptozoology
and xenobiology.

31:14.806 --> 31:17.240
Teratology, too,
when the need arises.

31:17.342 --> 31:20.607
"Teratology"?
What the hell is that?

31:26.551 --> 31:28.416
Welcome to the Sanctuary.

32:08.026 --> 32:09.493
Please.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.365
A mermaid?

32:15.466 --> 32:17.661
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Teratology.

32:17.769 --> 32:21.899
From the Greek "teratos," meaning
"deformity". "Hideous creature. "

32:22.006 --> 32:23.940
"Unknown being. "

32:24.909 --> 32:26.342
How is this even possible?

32:44.495 --> 32:46.395
He's a little frightened
of strangers.

32:46.497 --> 32:49.898
He's frightened?
What the hell is that?

32:50.001 --> 32:51.525
His classification
is of less importance

32:51.636 --> 32:54.503
than the simple reality
of his existence.

32:54.605 --> 32:56.903
I discovered him after his natural
habitat was destroyed

32:57.008 --> 32:59.909
by a South American
mining operation.

33:00.011 --> 33:02.445
Sadly, he may be
the last of his species.

33:02.547 --> 33:04.777
Oh, my God!

33:19.464 --> 33:20.829
Whoa!

33:24.068 --> 33:26.229
Come, now, don't be shy.

33:27.905 --> 33:30.465
Elemental powers
can be very difficult to control,

33:30.575 --> 33:32.805
but we have been
making progress.

33:38.416 --> 33:40.111
The purpose of the Sanctuary
is to find and help

33:40.218 --> 33:42.584
the unfortunate creatures
of this world.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.951
Some need saving.

33:45.056 --> 33:48.719
Others can't be allowed
to roam free. Case in point.

33:49.660 --> 33:51.924
New guy! New guy!

33:54.365 --> 33:56.230
Welcome!

33:56.334 --> 33:58.359
Watch your back!

33:58.469 --> 34:01.336
Stop it, both of you!

34:01.439 --> 34:04.374
I apologize.
They're incorrigible.

34:06.577 --> 34:09.637
Nature is nothing if not diverse.

34:16.020 --> 34:17.748
The patients on this level
are kept in cells

34:17.855 --> 34:19.755
mainly for their own well-being.

34:19.857 --> 34:22.849
For others,
it's a refuge of last resort.

34:23.694 --> 34:27.687
What, you mean some come here,
what, voluntarily?

34:27.799 --> 34:32.259
- Does that mean that others are...?
- Running free? Absolutely.

34:34.105 --> 34:36.402
This isn't a Zoo
and it's certainly not a prison.

34:36.507 --> 34:39.601
Yeah, but some of these things,
they look dangerous as hell.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.768
We have a dual obligation.

34:41.879 --> 34:45.781
To study the miraculous
and to protect against the perilous.

34:45.882 --> 34:47.475
Yeah, but...

34:47.585 --> 34:48.643
The dangerous ones.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.482
What's the point
of even keeping them?

34:50.588 --> 34:53.022
Every creature
expands our knowledge.

34:53.123 --> 34:56.616
We learn from the deadly
as well as the benign.

34:56.726 --> 34:58.524
How many more are there?

34:58.629 --> 34:59.960
Hmm...

35:00.064 --> 35:01.429
Many.

35:04.435 --> 35:07.996
So I'm guessing few people
have seen what I've just seen.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.199
Very few.

35:10.308 --> 35:12.776
How do you keep
a secret this big?

35:12.877 --> 35:14.310
Very carefully.

35:14.412 --> 35:17.347
The survival of my patients
depends on it.

35:17.448 --> 35:18.779
Please.

35:22.353 --> 35:23.342
Whoa!

35:23.454 --> 35:24.614
It's alright. It's alright.

35:26.824 --> 35:28.416
He's just as unnerved by you.

35:38.469 --> 35:41.802
He's been relatively isolated
since I first treated him.

35:44.942 --> 35:46.307
Thank you.

35:48.179 --> 35:51.114
I, uh... No.

36:10.201 --> 36:12.669
That thing is your patient?

36:12.770 --> 36:15.204
Former patient, actually.

36:15.306 --> 36:17.570
After I removed more
than a few bullets from him,

36:17.675 --> 36:19.108
he refused to leave.

36:19.210 --> 36:21.872
So I gave him a position
on my staff.

36:21.979 --> 36:25.176
I'm not sure he'd appreciate
you calling him a "thing. "

36:30.955 --> 36:32.354
Why me?

36:32.456 --> 36:34.151
Because, Dr. Zimmerman,

36:34.258 --> 36:38.251
I believe there's a vital role
for you to play here.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.592
By helping you
capture monsters?

36:40.698 --> 36:42.859
We prefer to call them
"abnormals. "

36:44.268 --> 36:45.496
The most important thing

36:45.603 --> 36:48.766
is that my patients have a place
where they can feel safe.

36:48.873 --> 36:51.034
Where we can help them,
learn from them.

36:51.142 --> 36:53.337
My head's kind of doing
the backstroke.

36:53.444 --> 36:55.639
Are you offering me a job here?

36:55.746 --> 36:58.579
I'm offering you a chance to explore
a world that you've been trying

36:58.683 --> 37:01.914
to understand on your own,
with very little success.

37:03.955 --> 37:05.923
You find my offer amusing?

37:06.023 --> 37:10.255
- No, it's not that. It's just -
- You're afraid.

37:10.361 --> 37:12.420
You work with monsters.

37:12.530 --> 37:16.296
I work with sentient beings,
each worthy of the same respect

37:16.400 --> 37:19.301
that humans, even animals,
receive automatically.

37:20.104 --> 37:22.664
These creatures are the key
to the evolution of our race,

37:22.773 --> 37:28.473
past and future, and yet
we revile them, destroy them.

37:28.579 --> 37:31.446
And worst of all,
pretend they don't even exist.

37:32.917 --> 37:35.385
But they are out there,
Dr. Zimmerman.

37:35.486 --> 37:38.387
Lost, like the child
you saw tonight.

37:39.290 --> 37:45.286
Misunderstood, hunted.
And they need our help. Your help.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.735
I still don't understand
why you would come to me.

37:51.836 --> 37:54.805
Because I need someone
who can see beyond the surface,

37:54.905 --> 37:56.930
see the world as it really is.

37:58.509 --> 38:01.535
I profile criminals, not monsters.

38:02.847 --> 38:06.078
You can't see the irony
in that statement?

38:06.183 --> 38:07.343
You know what I mean.

38:07.451 --> 38:09.919
You're a student
of the human animal.

38:10.021 --> 38:14.082
You see things, you read things
in behavior, that I believe

38:14.191 --> 38:17.319
cut across the variations
of outward form.

38:17.428 --> 38:23.230
Where others see stubbornness
and failure, I see great potential.

38:23.334 --> 38:25.598
Good doctors come and go,

38:25.703 --> 38:27.398
but the great ones
have always seen

38:27.505 --> 38:31.134
beyond the boundaries of science,
beyond the known.

38:32.276 --> 38:37.475
The great ones dare to believe
in the unbelievable.

38:57.134 --> 38:57.964
We've found our boy.

39:07.978 --> 39:11.846
What happened to those guys?
The boy again?

39:11.949 --> 39:16.147
Seeing as they're alive,
I doubt it. I have my theories.

39:25.296 --> 39:27.457
What I still don't understand is,

39:27.565 --> 39:29.533
who tipped you off
that the boy was down here?

39:29.633 --> 39:31.567
I did.

39:31.669 --> 39:34.160
I've been tracking
the little dweeb all night.

39:34.271 --> 39:36.000
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

39:36.107 --> 39:39.099
- You said you had him.
- I did, until the circus arrived.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.770
Still, roughing up two policemen.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.676
They were going to get
themselves killed.

39:43.781 --> 39:45.373
Uh, guys?

40:00.097 --> 40:01.724
It's okay.

40:12.643 --> 40:14.804
Don't! We need him alive!

40:19.316 --> 40:23.252
We want to help you.
Do you understand me?

40:24.422 --> 40:27.414
We're not going to hurt you,
I promise.

40:31.595 --> 40:33.222
That's it.

40:37.301 --> 40:40.429
Hey, hey, hey! Over here.

40:41.071 --> 40:45.940
Over here. Yeah, that's it.
That's it. Nice and easy.

40:48.479 --> 40:50.037
Any time.

40:59.256 --> 41:01.451
You okay?

41:01.559 --> 41:02.526
Yeah, I'm fine.

41:03.828 --> 41:05.955
This chaos was
completely avoidable.

41:06.897 --> 41:08.592
These tunnels reek
and I need a bath.

41:08.699 --> 41:12.135
- I don't need a lecture.
- Seriously, who are you?

41:14.138 --> 41:18.074
Dr. Zimmerman, this is Ashley.

41:18.175 --> 41:19.938
My daughter.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.778
I get it, alright?

41:29.954 --> 41:31.888
Ow! Mom, take it easy.

41:31.989 --> 41:34.719
All I'm saying is that we could have
better coordinated our efforts.

41:34.825 --> 41:38.022
Again, we got the ghoul, okay?
Take a pill.

41:38.128 --> 41:41.620
I apologize for Ashley's
unruly behavior, Dr. Zimmerman.

41:41.732 --> 41:42.994
What she lacks in refinement,

41:43.100 --> 41:46.467
I assure you she makes up for
in her field skills.

41:46.570 --> 41:49.562
- Really?
- Somebody saved your life tonight.

41:49.673 --> 41:53.905
- Oh, wait! That was me.
- Hold still.

41:54.011 --> 41:56.707
So I take it you guys, uh,
do this a lot?

41:56.814 --> 41:58.873
Oh, this is nothing.

41:58.983 --> 42:01.076
Hey, Mom, do you remember
the summer I turned 18?

42:01.185 --> 42:03.551
We do an entire den
of werewolves.

42:04.488 --> 42:06.649
You know,
as in bag and capture?

42:07.591 --> 42:09.525
Sedate and catalogue?

42:09.627 --> 42:10.889
It wasn't just me.
Mom was there, too.

42:10.995 --> 42:12.223
And a few nervous locals.

42:12.329 --> 42:15.526
One who seriously looked
like Adrien Brody.

42:15.633 --> 42:16.657
Ashley...

42:16.767 --> 42:18.928
Mom, you thought
he was hot, too.

42:19.036 --> 42:20.128
Dr. Zimmerman is our guest.

42:20.237 --> 42:21.966
Please bear that in mind
as you blather away.

42:22.072 --> 42:25.769
Anyway, we were low on silver tips,
full moon's on the rise -

42:25.876 --> 42:27.844
You're making this up.

42:29.346 --> 42:32.804
- You got the tour, right?
- Yeah, but...

42:32.917 --> 42:35.977
There we are, darling.
Good as new.

42:36.086 --> 42:37.314
Thank you.

42:37.421 --> 42:40.754
Hate to bleed and run,
but I got to be on the Eastside in 20.

42:40.858 --> 42:41.950
For what reason?

42:42.059 --> 42:44.755
Sylvio has some fabulous
new product for me.

42:44.862 --> 42:49.526
Top of the Line Kevlar, prototype
hollow-points, digital fuses...

42:49.633 --> 42:51.760
Actually, I'd prefer it
if you stayed in this evening.

42:52.636 --> 42:53.694
What do you mean? Why?

42:54.672 --> 42:57.539
There's been some fluctuations
in the EM shield.

42:57.641 --> 42:59.700
I'm sure it's nothing,
but just to be on the safe side.

42:59.810 --> 43:02.142
But this won't take an hour.

43:02.246 --> 43:04.407
And I promise I'll
grind him down on the price.

43:04.515 --> 43:06.107
We buy in bulk, we save a ton.

43:06.216 --> 43:07.740
We're Sylvio's best customers.

43:07.851 --> 43:10.615
His amazing deals aren't
going anywhere, believe me.

43:11.855 --> 43:13.789
It's been a long night, Ashley.
Please.

43:13.891 --> 43:16.086
Mom, come on, I'm just -

43:17.227 --> 43:19.923
Okay, Facebook it is.

43:20.030 --> 43:23.727
Nice to meet you.
Uh, keep the ice going.

43:28.739 --> 43:30.900
So she's your daughter?

43:31.008 --> 43:32.942
What, did you have her
when you were, like, 12?

43:33.611 --> 43:35.044
Very flattering.

43:35.145 --> 43:36.806
Adopted?

43:36.914 --> 43:39.109
The details are unimportant.

43:39.216 --> 43:43.016
Ashley is my flesh and blood
and she plays a vital role in my work.

43:43.854 --> 43:45.981
She bags them, you tag them.

43:46.090 --> 43:49.992
Something like that, but I find
it's what happens afterwards

43:50.094 --> 43:51.959
that matters the most.

43:58.402 --> 43:59.596
WILL: What is that?

43:59.703 --> 44:04.003
Massive genetic mutation,
creating a symbiotic appendage.

44:04.808 --> 44:05.706
Well, whatever it is,

44:05.809 --> 44:08.903
it helped him clear 20 feet
across an alley earlier tonight.

44:09.013 --> 44:11.914
Probably its most benign use.

44:12.016 --> 44:14.280
Such imperfect children
are often adopted

44:14.385 --> 44:16.751
by well-meaning
immigrant families.

44:16.854 --> 44:20.085
Some are blind. Others have
deformities, mental illness.

44:20.190 --> 44:22.283
I'm sure he seemed perfectly normal
in his photograph,

44:22.393 --> 44:24.293
if they even saw one.

44:25.295 --> 44:27.388
What do you intend
to do with him?

44:27.498 --> 44:30.228
I'll determine
his physiological treatment.

44:31.201 --> 44:33.999
But we have no hope of truly helping
him until we gain his trust.

44:40.411 --> 44:41.036
Wait...

44:42.980 --> 44:44.811
Is this why...?

44:49.386 --> 44:51.581
No.

44:51.689 --> 44:52.951
There's nothing in my training

44:53.057 --> 44:55.491
that even begins to apply
to a patient like this.

44:55.592 --> 44:58.755
Your training can't help you here
as much as your intuition can.

44:58.862 --> 45:02.559
This is insane.
I can't do this.

45:02.666 --> 45:05.931
What's more terrifying
to you, Dr. Zimmerman?

45:06.036 --> 45:09.494
That frightened,
confused boy down there,

45:09.606 --> 45:13.007
or the possibility that you lack
the courage to help him?

45:14.111 --> 45:17.046
Tell me, what do you see
when you look at him?

45:31.962 --> 45:34.430
Body language is...

45:34.531 --> 45:36.192
...agitated.

45:36.300 --> 45:38.928
Though he's given us no trouble
since he woke up.

45:39.036 --> 45:43.132
In fact, the only hostile thing
in that room is that...

45:43.240 --> 45:44.070
...thing.

45:44.174 --> 45:48.167
Then see beyond it.
See the boy.

45:48.278 --> 45:51.475
If you can do that,
then you can help him.

45:51.582 --> 45:55.018
If not, then so be it.

45:55.119 --> 45:57.087
I'll simply admit
that I was wrong about you.

46:07.131 --> 46:08.894
I'll leave it to you.
