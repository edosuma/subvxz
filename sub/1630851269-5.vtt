to the end of their shift

21:25.360 --> 21:27.080
without major incident.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.440
With any luck,

21:31.480 --> 21:33.720
they won't be picked
to do it again any time soon.

21:37.840 --> 21:41.360
It's been an exhausting day
for Swift too.

21:49.840 --> 21:53.000
But even after a hard day
out in the bush,

21:53.040 --> 21:56.680
mum still has to summon
the energy to feed the kids.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.960
The hungry pups
aren't the only ones

22:00.000 --> 22:02.480

from their mother...

22:05.600 --> 22:08.880
Laker's babysitting
baptism of fire

22:08.920 --> 22:12.440
has left her in need of
a reassuring snuggle.

22:14.400 --> 22:18.040
...which is fine by Swift,
as long as she can do it all...

22:24.800 --> 22:27.400
Every day brings
its own challenges.

22:29.280 --> 22:32.320
But being able to unwind
with family

22:32.360 --> 22:34.720
can ease the stresses of life.

22:43.480 --> 22:47.120
Outside the warm embrace
of your nearest and dearest...

22:47.160 --> 22:49.400
it's a very different story.

22:52.040 --> 22:58.680
Having had his roving fun,
Shandy makes his exit...

22:58.720 --> 23:02.520
Leaving two Ubuntu sisters
and their cousin,

23:02.560 --> 23:05.440
wondering what might have been.

23:08.080 --> 23:13.080
Sencha faces her first night
alone in the freezing desert.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.720
She's about to learn
the hard way

23:18.760 --> 23:22.920
what it means to be without
family.

It's a big move for small pups,
