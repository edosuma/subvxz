00:32.792 --> 00:34.417
<i>Moments...</i>

00:34.792 --> 00:36.417
<i>This is one.</i>

00:36.583 --> 00:40.458
<i>This right here, right now,
is definitely a moment.</i>

00:40.542 --> 00:42.083
Tessa?

00:43.083 --> 00:44.917
<i>Anything could happen next.</i>

00:45.000 --> 00:46.583
- Tessa?
- What?

00:46.625 --> 00:48.042
You're not listening to me.

00:48.167 --> 00:49.625
I am listening to you.

00:49.667 --> 00:51.333
What did I just say?

00:51.458 --> 00:53.167
I wasn't listening to you.

00:53.250 --> 00:54.667
I'm saying this is
a big night for you.

00:55.125 --> 00:56.625
Number one on the list.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.250
There is no list.

00:58.292 --> 00:59.583
You were gonna make a list.

00:59.833 --> 01:01.125
I haven't started.

01:01.833 --> 01:04.417
Then start now. Go on.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.583
Right. So, which one do you want?
Because I really don't mind.

01:11.625 --> 01:12.750
The blond one.

01:12.792 --> 01:14.500
The blond one? You're sure?

01:14.625 --> 01:16.875
You want him? Like I said,
I don't mind. Just...

01:17.042 --> 01:18.458
You can have the blond one.

01:18.583 --> 01:20.000
Only if you're sure.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.250
Zo...
What, babe?

01:25.542 --> 01:30.292
If I do this with someone I don't
know, does that make me a slag?

01:32.042 --> 01:33.833
It makes you alive.

01:50.667 --> 01:53.750
So, that club, are you
guys regulars there?

01:53.833 --> 01:56.417
No. You?

01:56.500 --> 01:57.833
Sometimes, you know.

01:58.458 --> 01:59.833
Right.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.625
Is there anywhere
else we can go?

02:13.083 --> 02:14.917
Do you want a cup of tea?
Or coffee?

02:16.167 --> 02:18.458
Sure, yeah. Either.

02:20.208 --> 02:21.667
We haven't
actually got any coffee.

02:22.458 --> 02:23.917
Okay.

02:25.750 --> 02:26.833
I can't find the tea.

02:27.167 --> 02:28.417
Water's fine.

02:43.875 --> 02:46.583
So, what's your favorite...

02:47.292 --> 02:48.750
Do you want to kiss me?

02:49.542 --> 02:51.000
God, yeah.

03:08.875 --> 03:11.292
Jesus Christ!
It's okay.

03:11.375 --> 03:13.000
Jesus bloody Christ!
It's fine.

03:13.542 --> 03:14.542
What happened?

03:14.583 --> 03:16.125
This girl's head... Her
head came off in my hand!

03:18.917 --> 03:20.750
What are you laughing at?
It's not funny.

03:21.458 --> 03:23.958
Scared the piss out of me.
Whoo!

03:39.792 --> 03:42.417
So, do you often
go out in disguise?

03:42.708 --> 03:44.583
The hair hat and all.

03:46.292 --> 03:49.958
I got given it. I was ill.

03:50.542 --> 03:52.083
Are you better now?

03:53.250 --> 03:54.792
All better.

04:14.542 --> 04:15.542
Oh.

04:19.750 --> 04:22.417
Aren't we supposed to do
that for a bit longer?

04:22.750 --> 04:24.250
I'm ready now.

04:24.417 --> 04:26.875
Wait, wait. Can you just
look at me for one second?

04:29.167 --> 04:30.417
This is my first time.

04:31.583 --> 04:32.917
Wow. That's amazing.

04:33.417 --> 04:34.625
Obviously it's not yours.

04:34.750 --> 04:36.000
Stop talking now.

04:38.292 --> 04:39.708
Yeah, not like this.

04:40.833 --> 04:41.875
What?

04:41.917 --> 04:44.750
Sorry. Not gonna happen.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.583
You're shitting me.
You come this far, and...

04:48.667 --> 04:50.833
I'm sorry. Really.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.250
Whatever.

04:59.375 --> 05:00.875
Okay.

05:03.583 --> 05:04.958
Okay.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.750
Thanks.
Thank you.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.750
I don't understand it.
I just don't get it.

07:32.792 --> 07:34.292
You always tell me everything.

07:34.417 --> 07:35.958
I never tell you anything.

07:36.292 --> 07:39.083
Why don't you start now? What
were you doing last night?

07:39.125 --> 07:41.750
Keep asking, Dad.
The 15th time is the charm.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.208
Hi, I'm Caroline, Richard's producer.
We spoke on the phone.

07:47.250 --> 07:48.458
Hi. Good to
meet you in person.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.208
And this must be Tessa.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.083
That's me!

07:52.833 --> 07:55.667
The lift's not working.
Can she manage the stairs?

07:56.083 --> 07:57.375
Yeah, she'll be fine.

07:57.542 --> 07:58.542
Okay.

08:01.042 --> 08:02.917
Tessa Scott and her father.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.250
- Hi, guys. Take a seat.
- Hello.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.042
Really pleased to be here.

08:08.167 --> 08:09.417
Yeah, we're big fans.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.292
Great. We'll just
have a little chat.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.417
Be as natural as you can and
I'll help you through. Okay?

08:14.708 --> 08:15.917
So, what's your
angle going to be?

08:15.958 --> 08:17.167
Is it the whole
dying girl thing,

08:17.250 --> 08:18.750
or do you have
something original planned?

08:18.833 --> 08:20.083
Sorry?

08:20.375 --> 08:21.542
Tessa.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.292
I know it's heavy stuff, but let's
try to keep it upbeat. Yeah?

08:26.292 --> 08:29.750
And now I'm delighted to have
as my guest in the studio

08:29.792 --> 08:33.625
a very brave young
lady indeed, Tessa Scott.

08:33.957 --> 08:36.750
Tessa's been living with leukemia
for the past four years,

08:36.792 --> 08:39.125
and she's here with
her dad to talk about it.

08:39.457 --> 08:42.207
Tell us, when did you realize
that Tessa was first ill?

08:42.250 --> 08:43.832
Four years ago.

08:43.917 --> 08:45.917
She had, well,
we thought it was the flu,

08:45.958 --> 08:47.250
Tessa's mum and I.

08:47.333 --> 08:49.917
But the flu just
wouldn't clear up.

08:50.625 --> 08:52.625
The blood test
confirmed our worst fears.

08:52.708 --> 08:54.292
The doctors told
us they couldn't

08:54.417 --> 08:56.000
hold out any hope
for her survival,

08:56.083 --> 08:57.542
which brought us
to the point where

08:57.667 --> 08:59.125
Tessa felt like
she had no choice

08:59.208 --> 09:01.417
but to end her
chemotherapy entirely.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.917
Tessa, you chose to
give up the treatment.

09:03.958 --> 09:05.750
That's a big
decision for a 17-year-old.

09:06.125 --> 09:07.917
If I may...

09:08.000 --> 09:09.083
The more aggressive treatments,

09:09.125 --> 09:10.125
they would have only slightly

09:10.208 --> 09:11.875
prolonged Tessa's life.

09:12.042 --> 09:14.125
There are other ways
to maintain her health.

09:14.208 --> 09:15.917
Dad... For example,
studies have shown

09:15.958 --> 09:18.750
that good nutrition can
rebalance a system entirely.

09:18.833 --> 09:21.250
That's why we're here really,
to raise awareness, and...

09:21.292 --> 09:22.333
Dad...
What?

09:24.708 --> 09:26.167
He's gonna have
to stop sometime.

09:27.208 --> 09:28.958
Stop what, Tessa?

09:29.375 --> 09:30.875
He knows it's gonna happen.

09:30.917 --> 09:32.750
But he can't stop
hoping that it won't.

09:37.375 --> 09:38.917
It's true that if
I kept going with the chemo,

09:39.000 --> 09:40.333
I'd probably live a bit longer.

09:41.375 --> 09:42.667
But it made me feel so bad.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.792
And there are things
I want to do before I die.

09:46.917 --> 09:48.083
Things?

09:49.167 --> 09:51.792
Yeah. I've got a list.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.500
Oh. Your dad
didn't mention that.

09:54.583 --> 09:56.333
That's 'cause
he doesn't know about it.

09:56.583 --> 09:57.792
Most of what's
on it is illegal.

09:58.375 --> 09:59.750
I'm almost scared to ask.

09:59.958 --> 10:01.333
Well, I nearly
had sex last night,

10:01.875 --> 10:03.708
which isn't actually technically
against the law of course,

10:03.792 --> 10:05.875
but it was so crap the guy
should be arrested anyway.

10:05.958 --> 10:08.083
Okay, I think that's
all we've got time for.

10:08.250 --> 10:09.417
Next I'm planning
to take drugs.

10:09.458 --> 10:10.667
Do you have
any advice which ones?

10:10.708 --> 10:11.750
That's enough, Tessa.

10:11.833 --> 10:13.250
Very amusing.

10:13.292 --> 10:15.083
Sex and drugs
and rock 'n' roll.

10:15.208 --> 10:17.125
Ladies and gents,
I think you'll agree

10:17.333 --> 10:20.250
there is a young lady
taking life by the horns.

10:20.292 --> 10:22.125
Thank you very much,
Tessa and her dad.

10:22.417 --> 10:24.042
Thank you.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.083
And now the weather.
Squally this morning,

10:27.167 --> 10:29.042
rounding up this afternoon
and clearing

10:29.083 --> 10:30.667
for the rest of the week.

10:38.208 --> 10:39.542
She's out.
No.

10:39.625 --> 10:40.792
Dad...

10:41.125 --> 10:42.250
Wait.

10:45.625 --> 10:46.833
Bad night?

10:46.958 --> 10:48.208
There's no such thing.

10:48.458 --> 10:49.792
Hello, darlings. Come on in.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.250
Hi, Mum.

10:52.125 --> 10:53.250
You look stressed.

10:53.792 --> 10:55.958
Blame her. Back at 4:00.

11:02.875 --> 11:05.583
It's a new trick, Mum.
I can make a coin disappear.

11:05.875 --> 11:06.958
Do you want to see it?

11:07.042 --> 11:08.333
No, darling.
Not before coffee.

11:09.292 --> 11:12.375
Nothing before the coffee.
Show your sister.

11:12.458 --> 11:15.000
She's never interested.
She doesn't care.

11:15.333 --> 11:16.792
I'm sure she does.

11:16.875 --> 11:18.625
I really don't.

11:18.833 --> 11:20.792
Why don't you go and watch
CBeebies or something?

11:21.417 --> 11:23.000
Because I'm nine.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.917
I heard you on the radio.

11:29.542 --> 11:30.708
You met a boy.

11:32.167 --> 11:33.708
Tessa, promise me
you'll always use a condom.

11:36.042 --> 11:37.542
I know the smell of
rubber can be off-putting,

11:37.583 --> 11:38.625
but, then, so is gonorrhea.

11:38.708 --> 11:42.375
Please stop. My panic attack
is having a panic attack.

11:44.042 --> 11:45.625
And don't have casual sex.

11:47.333 --> 11:48.333
Really?

11:48.542 --> 11:49.542
No, darling.

11:50.208 --> 11:52.292
You must always, always
try as hard as you can.

11:58.125 --> 11:59.417
I've got to get a tattoo.

11:59.542 --> 12:00.875
And I want one and all.

12:00.958 --> 12:02.750
Over my whole body, of myself.

12:02.833 --> 12:05.375
And taller, with bigger tits.

12:07.208 --> 12:08.375
What's up?

12:08.500 --> 12:09.667
He's such a bloody liar.

12:09.750 --> 12:11.250
Who?
Scott.

12:11.875 --> 12:13.375
Said he had a stall here.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.042
Is that why we came?

12:15.125 --> 12:16.417
I can't believe
he'd blow me off.

12:16.542 --> 12:17.875
I gave him
the ride of his life.

12:17.958 --> 12:19.125
Zo...
Wanker.

12:19.208 --> 12:20.250
Zo...
What?

12:20.333 --> 12:22.083
He's right there.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.458
Hey, handsome.

12:26.542 --> 12:27.542
What's up?

12:27.875 --> 12:30.625
I don't know. You tell me.

12:30.708 --> 12:31.958
Or better yet, show me.

12:32.375 --> 12:34.250
Hey.

12:36.708 --> 12:37.875
Hey.

12:38.875 --> 12:40.083
How are you?

12:40.833 --> 12:42.083
I'm fine.

12:42.542 --> 12:44.417
I know I left you hanging the
other night and I just wanted...

12:44.500 --> 12:45.583
No, it was my fault.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.208
What?

12:48.250 --> 12:50.833
I just...
I could've been a bit more...

12:50.875 --> 12:52.083
She told you.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.625
What?

12:54.792 --> 12:57.792
You did, didn't you?
You told him about me.

12:58.458 --> 13:00.167
Shouldn't have done that.

13:00.583 --> 13:02.083
Tessa, wait!

13:02.917 --> 13:04.375
Tessa!

13:27.000 --> 13:29.083
Hey. You missed lunch.

13:29.917 --> 13:31.625
You eat it.

13:38.875 --> 13:40.250
What are you
doing with all this?

13:40.333 --> 13:42.292
There's a bonfire in
the garden next door.

13:44.583 --> 13:47.542
Don't do that.
Please don't do that.

13:47.667 --> 13:50.375
If you don't want
these things, I do.

13:50.667 --> 13:52.708
That's Spain.
You were in remission.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.917
A boy whistled at me,
and you took that.

13:58.167 --> 14:00.000
Said I'd never want to
forget my first whistle.

14:01.167 --> 14:02.458
Yeah.

14:03.583 --> 14:04.750
But I do.

14:51.250 --> 14:52.500
What are you doing?

14:55.333 --> 14:56.792
Do you mind?

14:58.208 --> 14:59.792
Feel very free.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.375
I'm Adam.

15:04.708 --> 15:06.000
And you're Tessa.

15:07.583 --> 15:08.917
I've seen you around,
since we moved here.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.750
I meant to
introduce myself, but...

15:12.000 --> 15:14.083
They're not love letters.

15:14.292 --> 15:15.583
It's none of my business.

15:15.917 --> 15:17.583
I'm just saying. I didn't
get dumped or anything.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.333
I wouldn't have thought so.

15:23.542 --> 15:26.208
Anyway,
I've got more stuff to burn.

15:26.292 --> 15:27.667
Cool, whack it on.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.833
This is going.

15:35.208 --> 15:38.708
Probably best.
That's a dangerous dress.

15:43.917 --> 15:45.333
Are you okay?

15:56.375 --> 15:57.750
Tessa?

16:00.042 --> 16:03.458
All right, don't move. Don't
move. I think you fainted.

16:03.792 --> 16:05.292
Are you diabetic?

16:05.625 --> 16:07.417
Do you need sugar?

16:08.083 --> 16:09.875
Have some of this.

16:13.583 --> 16:14.833
It's flat.

16:14.958 --> 16:16.208
You're tough to please.

16:16.292 --> 16:18.875
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

16:20.167 --> 16:23.000
Okay, excellent. Not embarrassed,
not embarrassed at all.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.958
No, it's cool, all right?

16:25.375 --> 16:27.458
I mean, I've never had that
effect on someone before.

16:27.542 --> 16:29.292
I kind of like it.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.792
This is a nice garden.

16:33.708 --> 16:37.250
Thanks. It's kind of my thing.
It keeps my mum happy.

16:37.333 --> 16:38.542
How about your dad?

16:38.583 --> 16:40.083
It's just the two of us.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.500
I should get home.
All right. You need help?

16:45.250 --> 16:47.167
It's not exactly far.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.958
So, anytime you've got
something to burn...

16:51.250 --> 16:53.708
Or I just want to pass out
in front of someone...

16:54.833 --> 16:56.292
You know where to come.

16:57.042 --> 16:58.333
Yes, I do.

17:08.791 --> 17:10.750
When Tessa dies,
can we go on holiday?

17:12.708 --> 17:14.250
Cal, that's an awful
thing to say.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.000
I don't even
remember going to Spain.

17:16.333 --> 17:18.541
It was so long ago,
it might not even be true.

17:18.666 --> 17:20.166
Cal, that's enough.
Go to your room.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.625
Dad...
What's wrong?

17:21.708 --> 17:22.958
Get out!

17:23.041 --> 17:24.416
What did I say that was wrong?

17:28.541 --> 17:29.750
It's all very confusing.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.667
No, it's not.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.167
This is your day.

17:33.583 --> 17:34.958
And what does that mean?

17:35.583 --> 17:37.375
That I'll do whatever you want.

17:37.833 --> 17:39.042
Buy more things?

17:39.167 --> 17:40.375
Sure.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.000
Where does the money come from?

17:42.542 --> 17:43.708
A credit card.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.542
Buy now, pay later.

17:45.625 --> 17:47.375
Or you know, not.

17:48.542 --> 17:51.042
Watch where you're flying. You
almost poked the guy's eye out.

17:51.125 --> 17:52.375
I wish I could fly for real.

17:53.042 --> 17:54.083
Yeah?

18:06.792 --> 18:08.708
Amazing!

18:11.750 --> 18:14.042
That was better than
the best thing ever!

18:14.125 --> 18:15.500
Can I go again?

18:15.625 --> 18:17.000
I think it's your sister's go.

18:17.542 --> 18:18.792
I'm good, I'm just watching.

18:18.875 --> 18:20.250
Are you sure?
Yeah.

18:20.875 --> 18:22.917
She's sick. She can't
do this kind of thing.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.542
All right, mate, well, let's
get you hooked up again.

18:25.625 --> 18:28.708
Actually, you know what?

18:30.542 --> 18:32.375
I will have a crack.

18:33.458 --> 18:35.208
Ready?
Ready.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.917
Tessa, I don't know
if this is a good idea.

19:05.292 --> 19:06.333
Is she okay?

19:06.375 --> 19:07.458
She's fine.

19:07.542 --> 19:09.750
She just doesn't
want it to end.

19:19.542 --> 19:21.417
It wasn't your money.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.125
She's late.

19:23.208 --> 19:25.000
Do you hear what I'm saying?

19:25.042 --> 19:26.250
She promised she'd come.

19:26.625 --> 19:27.875
Tessa...

19:28.458 --> 19:30.292
Do you want Cal to
return everything?

19:30.375 --> 19:32.500
Why should he be punished?

19:32.708 --> 19:34.458
What are you doing?

19:34.542 --> 19:35.625
Is this to do with your list?

19:35.708 --> 19:36.708
I don't have a list.

19:36.833 --> 19:38.542
You told that
radio guy you had a list.

19:38.625 --> 19:39.917
He was a knob.

19:40.042 --> 19:41.417
Yeah, he was a knob.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.750
You were still more honest
with him than you are with me.

19:44.833 --> 19:46.125
How do you think
that makes me feel?

19:46.250 --> 19:47.583
I don't give
a crap how you feel.

19:47.667 --> 19:50.083
She's not coming.
Let's do this.

19:57.167 --> 19:59.208
Tessa, there'll be
a slight pinch and burn,

19:59.542 --> 20:02.625
then the anesthetic
will kick in. All right?

20:03.708 --> 20:04.917
Good.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.292
Now, I wiggle up and down

20:07.375 --> 20:10.375
to break the tissue
around the insertion point.

20:10.458 --> 20:12.583
She may feel a slight tugging
across the chest,

20:12.958 --> 20:14.625
but once the line
detaches from the cuff,

20:14.708 --> 20:16.208
it will simply slide away.

20:17.542 --> 20:20.042
Now, of course I can
reinsert the catheter

20:20.167 --> 20:22.167
should you wish to
recommence your treatment.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.292
I'm saying you can
change your mind.

20:24.375 --> 20:26.167
I won't change my mind.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.292
Dad?

20:28.958 --> 20:30.542
She won't change her mind.

20:31.375 --> 20:32.875
All right then.

20:41.375 --> 20:43.250
Hold that for me.

20:43.792 --> 20:44.875
Good girl.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.333
Do you want to slap my rump?

20:48.333 --> 20:50.042
What? No.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.583
Then don't talk to me
like I'm a horse.

20:53.542 --> 20:55.375
Yes.

20:56.208 --> 20:57.458
Sorry.

21:01.625 --> 21:04.458
Hey, it's done now. It's done.

21:08.375 --> 21:10.000
You know what to look out for?

21:10.042 --> 21:13.792
Yeah. Chill, fever,
stiff neck or headache.

21:14.167 --> 21:16.583
Drainage, bleeding,
loss of strength.

21:16.625 --> 21:18.375
You're good.

21:19.125 --> 21:21.208
Thanks for all your help.

21:23.125 --> 21:24.417
She likes you.

21:24.542 --> 21:25.833
I doubt that.

21:25.875 --> 21:28.000
I mean it.
You're bang in there.

21:28.042 --> 21:30.500
You should definitely
ask her out or something.

21:30.542 --> 21:34.500
Tessa! Tessa, wait, I'm here.
I'm coming. Stay there.

21:40.875 --> 21:43.500
Oh, God, did I miss it?
I left on time.

21:43.542 --> 21:45.875
But there was
this insane traffic.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.333
I definitely left on time.
I just...

21:48.458 --> 21:50.083
Sure, whatever.

21:50.167 --> 21:51.333
Tessa...

21:51.458 --> 21:52.667
I don't care.

21:52.708 --> 21:54.167
Oh, don't be like that.

21:54.208 --> 21:56.500
How do you expect her to be?

21:56.542 --> 21:58.417
I'm sorry, this has
what to do with you?

21:58.500 --> 22:00.167
Is that a serious question?
Yes, it's a serious...

22:00.208 --> 22:01.708
Enough.

22:02.458 --> 22:04.375
You both suck.

22:04.417 --> 22:06.417
One of you is this
cancer obsessive,

22:06.458 --> 22:07.708
and the other
can't even face showing up

22:07.750 --> 22:08.958
at the hospital, which is fine,

22:09.542 --> 22:11.250
I get it.

22:11.292 --> 22:13.292
But neither of you
are what I need.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.417
You're just wasting my time.

22:22.708 --> 22:25.125
All I'm saying... This is
not gonna be all you say.

22:25.375 --> 22:27.625
All I'm saying is...
There'll be another thing.

22:27.875 --> 22:30.625
All I'm saying is, you don't
have to stay in on my account.

22:30.708 --> 22:32.583
You could go out and see
your friends more often.

22:32.625 --> 22:35.083
And that's all I'm saying.
Okay. Okay.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.250
I've just taken drugs.

22:44.042 --> 22:46.542
Excellent.
Have you met my mum?

22:49.708 --> 22:50.750
Hi.

22:50.875 --> 22:51.875
Hi.

22:53.250 --> 22:55.375
Mushrooms is all I did,
which are natural.

22:55.750 --> 22:58.292
If not strictly legal.

22:58.750 --> 22:59.958
My friend did
buy some ketamine,

23:00.042 --> 23:01.417
but she thought
the dealer was a bit skanky,

23:01.542 --> 23:04.875
so we've gone with
the shrooms instead.

23:08.583 --> 23:10.208
See you inside.

23:13.917 --> 23:14.958
That went well.

23:15.042 --> 23:16.042
I thought so.

23:17.708 --> 23:18.917
How much did you take?

23:19.042 --> 23:20.250
Not much.

23:20.625 --> 23:22.417
I don't know, I'm not really
that clued up on the stuff.

23:22.458 --> 23:23.583
Yeah, me neither.

23:24.042 --> 23:25.958
Look, I'll drive you somewhere.
Keep you out of trouble.

23:26.375 --> 23:27.917
I'm not sure how long
it takes to kick in.

23:35.458 --> 23:36.958
About that long.

23:39.333 --> 23:45.292
<i>♪ Seven shooting stars

What?

24:46.708 --> 24:48.417
What did you say?

24:58.542 --> 24:59.917
All right,
we could hang out here.

24:59.958 --> 25:02.583
There's no one around,
so you guys can go crazy.

25:02.708 --> 25:04.458
I don't want to go crazy.

25:04.542 --> 25:06.917
I don't have to
go crazy at all.

25:07.042 --> 25:09.125
I'll just be up here.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.792
What are you doing?

25:10.875 --> 25:13.208
All right. Get down.

25:13.250 --> 25:14.708
Come on, get down, off the roof.
No.

25:14.750 --> 25:16.917
Come on, get down. Please.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.083
Why? Are you gonna make me?

25:19.375 --> 25:20.917
No, I'm just gonna tell you.
Get down.

25:23.083 --> 25:25.292
Fine. All right?
Thank you.

25:26.625 --> 25:28.375
Harshing my buzz.

25:28.917 --> 25:30.250
Where's Tessa?

25:30.375 --> 25:31.750
What?

26:00.208 --> 26:01.708
<i>We gotta go after her.</i>

26:02.083 --> 26:03.917
We didn't see
which way she went.

26:03.958 --> 26:05.292
We need to find her. Now.

26:05.375 --> 26:07.458
She'll come back.
I mean, it's no big thing.

26:07.542 --> 26:09.125
We're just out here.
There's no danger.

26:09.208 --> 26:10.917
Yes, there is.

26:11.583 --> 26:14.208
Why? Zoey...

26:14.958 --> 26:16.917
This time I'm really
not supposed to tell you.

26:17.792 --> 26:20.083
Not supposed to tell me what?

26:20.875 --> 26:22.625
Tessa!

26:24.875 --> 26:26.417
Tessa!

26:31.083 --> 26:32.583
Tessa!

26:40.417 --> 26:41.750
Tessa!

26:42.375 --> 26:45.042
I've discovered something.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.375
Are you okay?
Can you get down?

26:53.875 --> 26:55.583
I don't want to.

26:58.042 --> 27:00.042
All right, just wait.

27:00.125 --> 27:02.292
Just hold on, I'm coming.

27:17.083 --> 27:18.583
Just hold on.

27:34.583 --> 27:35.917
Tessa...

27:36.292 --> 27:37.792
You need to come
down now, please.

27:38.375 --> 27:40.208
You need to let me
help you climb down.

27:41.042 --> 27:43.417
I'm going to
tell you something.

27:44.542 --> 27:47.417
But you have to promise
not to tell anyone, okay?

27:52.042 --> 27:53.750
I'm not sick here.

27:54.875 --> 27:56.750
I'm not sick anymore.

27:58.542 --> 28:01.292
I just need to stay
here in this wood.

28:02.542 --> 28:06.542
I need to keep away from the
modern world and all its gadgets

28:07.292 --> 28:09.417
and then I won't be sick.

28:10.875 --> 28:13.375
You can stay
with me if you want.

28:14.083 --> 28:15.583
I'd like it if you did.

28:17.250 --> 28:20.083
We'll build things,
shelters and tracks.

28:20.542 --> 28:22.458
We'll grow vegetables.

28:23.292 --> 28:24.917
We'll be safe.

28:28.042 --> 28:29.458
Tessa...
No.

28:30.375 --> 28:34.125
Please. Don't say anything.

28:51.542 --> 28:52.708
Tessa?

28:53.333 --> 28:54.500
What?

28:55.042 --> 28:56.917
Will I still be
a brother when you're dead?

29:00.000 --> 29:01.333
I'll still be around.

29:02.542 --> 29:04.417
Are you going to haunt me?

29:04.750 --> 29:06.625
Not if you don't want me to.

29:07.417 --> 29:09.250
Just I might be a bit scared.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.958
The nurse is here. Dad says
come down when you're ready.

29:24.708 --> 29:26.000
Enjoying your cake?

29:26.125 --> 29:27.417
Mmm.

29:27.458 --> 29:29.833
It's lovely.
Thank you, Tessa.

29:30.250 --> 29:32.500
I'm Philippa.

29:35.583 --> 29:37.292
You don't look like
you're feeling too good.

29:37.667 --> 29:39.167
Would you be?

29:40.500 --> 29:43.917
Take nothing personally. She was
rude to last week's nurse, too.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.958
Sian, I think she was called.

29:47.042 --> 29:48.917
Don't pretend you've forgotten
her name, Dad.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.167
You asked her to stay
for supper. She said no.

29:54.333 --> 29:56.083
I'll be next door.

29:59.292 --> 30:01.417
He does everything wrong.

30:01.833 --> 30:03.250
How does that make you feel?

30:03.375 --> 30:04.792
It makes me laugh.

30:06.667 --> 30:09.250
You know,
there are support groups.

30:10.500 --> 30:13.917
Places you can meet people
in the same position as you.

30:13.958 --> 30:15.333
I went to one of those.

30:15.833 --> 30:18.000
Met a cool girl called Angela.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.083
So why not talk
to her about all this?

30:20.292 --> 30:21.500
Because she died.

30:23.042 --> 30:24.333
Last time I make that mistake.

30:24.833 --> 30:25.917
Are we done?

30:38.167 --> 30:39.292
Hey.

30:41.083 --> 30:42.250
Hey.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.458
You don't have to
look at me like that.

30:45.542 --> 30:48.167
I'm just dying.
It's not contagious.

30:49.917 --> 30:51.250
How are you feeling today?

30:51.375 --> 30:52.750
Can I come for a ride?

30:53.625 --> 30:55.417
Do you always answer a question
with another question?

30:55.667 --> 30:56.833
Does that annoy you?

30:58.167 --> 30:59.917
Bit tricky to ride
this at the minute.

30:59.958 --> 31:01.667
I thought I'd strip the
engine down, give it a clean.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.833
And now you can't
put it back together.

31:04.167 --> 31:05.917
What do you mean?
I can, no trouble.

31:06.833 --> 31:09.792
Just so long as this
bit wasn't important.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.458
Where did you say
we were going again?

31:20.417 --> 31:21.792
I didn't.

31:24.167 --> 31:25.333
What?

31:40.167 --> 31:43.583
A good long cross-country hike.
Excellent.

31:43.625 --> 31:45.958
Because my big problem
is too much energy to burn.

31:47.500 --> 31:48.917
Nearly there.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.292
It's worth it, yeah?

32:04.375 --> 32:05.583
Yes.

32:14.250 --> 32:17.250
So, what's the story
with you and your mum?

32:18.125 --> 32:19.792
My dad died last year.
He was hit by a car.

32:22.833 --> 32:26.083
I had a place at college,
but I had to defer it.

32:29.167 --> 32:31.000
You should still go.

32:31.125 --> 32:33.250
I don't know. I kind of...

32:34.292 --> 32:37.083
I'm not sure I was
ready for it anyway.

32:41.417 --> 32:43.000
Are you afraid?

32:48.125 --> 32:49.917
It comes and goes.

32:52.042 --> 32:53.250
Most people think
that when you're sick

32:53.333 --> 32:56.500
you become fearless and brave,

32:56.542 --> 32:58.083
but you don't.

33:01.167 --> 33:04.958
Most of the time it's like
being stalked by a psycho,

33:05.042 --> 33:07.583
like I might get
shot any second.

33:09.167 --> 33:11.583
Sometimes I forget
about it for hours.

33:12.333 --> 33:13.875
What makes you forget?

33:15.792 --> 33:18.250
When I was with you
in the wood,

33:19.292 --> 33:22.458
I didn't think about it
for the whole afternoon.

33:25.958 --> 33:27.417
Look at me.

33:31.667 --> 33:34.000
I'm not thinking about it now.

34:34.125 --> 34:35.542
So, why don't you want to go?

34:35.667 --> 34:37.083
I shouldn't have said anything.

34:37.125 --> 34:39.083
Genie's out of the bottle now.

34:39.125 --> 34:40.333
Whose party is it?

34:40.458 --> 34:41.667
I'm not sure.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.042
You didn't get invited?

34:43.083 --> 34:44.708
That's not really how it works.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.917
But all your mates are going?

34:47.042 --> 34:48.542
I guess, yeah.

34:49.583 --> 34:51.458
I just haven't done
this stuff in a while.

34:52.500 --> 34:53.708
Makes two of us.

35:09.958 --> 35:11.250
Hey, so, do you just
want to hang out here?

35:11.292 --> 35:12.417
I'll get us something to drink.

35:12.500 --> 35:13.542
Yeah.

35:23.750 --> 35:25.292
Or come with me?

35:25.875 --> 35:26.917
I'll come with you.

35:37.792 --> 35:38.917
Hey, there he is!

35:39.042 --> 35:40.125
Hi, guys...

35:40.208 --> 35:41.583
Sorry to bother you,

35:41.625 --> 35:42.917
it's just
we used to know someone

35:43.000 --> 35:44.250
who looked just
like your friend here.

35:44.833 --> 35:46.500
I'm Tessa.
It's nice to meet you.

35:46.542 --> 35:48.042
If you're the one that got
him out of the house,

35:48.125 --> 35:49.250
it's good to meet you, too.

35:49.292 --> 35:50.625
How's college?

35:50.875 --> 35:52.250
You don't even have to
pretend to learn anything.

35:52.333 --> 35:54.250
You should try it.
Yeah, I will, sometime.

35:58.875 --> 35:59.875
Are you drinking this?

35:59.958 --> 36:00.958
Yeah, actually...

36:06.542 --> 36:08.583
Yeah, it's good, I think, just
to pop in to parties like that.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.708
Don't want to outstay
a welcome, do you?

36:10.792 --> 36:14.083
You got a pretty big one there.
You should get out more.

36:14.167 --> 36:17.958
Well, then they wouldn't care
when I walked in, would they?

36:18.042 --> 36:19.500
Did that girl hurt you?

36:19.625 --> 36:21.083
Other way round.

36:21.167 --> 36:22.833
I caught her fist
a good one with my chin,

36:22.917 --> 36:26.167
then whacked her right in
the knee with my nose.

36:27.083 --> 36:28.417
You need to be careful.

36:28.542 --> 36:29.833
No, I don't.

36:30.750 --> 36:32.458
That's the thing.

36:34.542 --> 36:35.750
Here you go then.

36:35.875 --> 36:37.125
How do you mean?

36:37.667 --> 36:39.208
This is you.
No, bollocks, no way.

36:39.292 --> 36:40.458
I'll walk you to your door.

36:40.542 --> 36:41.917
Are you sure?
Yeah, of course, no trouble.

36:44.625 --> 36:45.708
See?

36:48.833 --> 36:50.292
Thank you.

37:48.750 --> 37:49.875
Hey.

37:51.708 --> 37:52.833
Hello.

37:53.667 --> 37:55.125
You dropped a fiver.

37:55.208 --> 37:56.208
What?

37:56.333 --> 37:58.625
That fiver. You dropped it.

37:59.458 --> 38:01.125
That's not mine.

38:01.208 --> 38:02.667
I saw it come
out of your pocket.

38:03.833 --> 38:05.792
Really?
Yeah.

38:06.750 --> 38:08.542
'Cause I was looking.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.750
Okay, well, thanks.

38:25.083 --> 38:26.708
That was so cool.
It totally was.

38:26.792 --> 38:29.250
We rock as criminals. That
flirty eye thing you were doing.

38:29.333 --> 38:31.917
What about you nipping in there
with the perfect timing?

38:32.000 --> 38:33.042
So now what?

38:33.083 --> 38:34.542
Now we get some
cash out and party.

38:34.583 --> 38:35.958
With the card?
Right.

38:36.042 --> 38:37.250
Okay. What's the number?

38:37.375 --> 38:38.625
What do you mean?

38:39.708 --> 38:41.000
Didn't you see the number?

38:41.083 --> 38:42.625
No, I was doing
the flirty eye thing.

38:42.708 --> 38:43.917
I was nipping in there.

38:44.458 --> 38:45.958
We suck as criminals.

38:46.667 --> 38:49.083
Probably best.
The guy seemed all right.

38:49.167 --> 38:50.458
Maybe we should try
and give his card back.

38:50.542 --> 38:51.542
And how are we
going to do that?

38:51.583 --> 38:53.167
Not interrupting anything,
am I? Get...

39:16.042 --> 39:17.833
Tessa...
What?

39:17.917 --> 39:19.583
The card.
What about it?

39:19.667 --> 39:21.250
Give it back to him!

39:32.083 --> 39:34.458
Scott plays it cool.
I know he's crazy about me.

39:34.542 --> 39:35.875
How'd you know?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.333
Because he's a guy.

39:37.417 --> 39:38.792
I'll take your word for it.

39:38.875 --> 39:40.625
So, why didn't he
call me last night?

39:40.708 --> 39:42.292
Zo, there's something
I need to tell you.

39:42.417 --> 39:43.958
Let's get this done first.

39:44.042 --> 39:45.958
Remember, shoplifting's
all about confidence.

39:46.042 --> 39:48.375
Walk tall, pick and pocket.

39:48.458 --> 39:50.875
In there, we go in separate.

39:51.375 --> 39:52.375
Why not together?

39:52.458 --> 39:53.667
More suspicious. Go on.

39:56.417 --> 39:57.958
Right.

40:31.875 --> 40:34.125
Tessa? Tessa Scott?

40:34.375 --> 40:35.833
No. Sorry.

40:35.875 --> 40:37.375
It is you.

40:37.542 --> 40:40.125
Don't you remember us?
From school.

40:42.792 --> 40:43.958
Oh, yeah.

40:44.250 --> 40:45.667
You left in Year 11,
didn't you?

40:46.208 --> 40:47.333
Ten.

40:48.542 --> 40:52.708
So how's it going? Are you still
having all that treatment?

40:54.625 --> 40:55.792
Not anymore.

40:56.083 --> 40:57.167
So you're better?

40:57.708 --> 40:58.750
No.

41:02.917 --> 41:04.250
What do you two want?

41:04.500 --> 41:06.458
Hi, Zoey.
You helping her shop?

41:08.417 --> 41:09.792
Are you ready to go?
Yeah.

41:09.875 --> 41:11.708
Is it true you've been
seeing Scott Redmond?

41:15.125 --> 41:16.750
What's it to you?
Do you know him?

41:16.833 --> 41:17.833
All right, let's go.

41:17.875 --> 41:18.958
Everybody knows him.

41:19.042 --> 41:21.917
He went out with my sister
for about half an hour.

41:22.750 --> 41:24.292
Is that right?

41:24.667 --> 41:26.625
I have to go collect
the invites for my funeral.

41:27.083 --> 41:28.708
Really?
Yeah.

41:28.792 --> 41:30.000
I also need to
sort out the readings.

41:30.083 --> 41:32.458
Make sure it's not that bloody poem.
It's been done to death.

41:32.750 --> 41:33.833
Let go of me.

41:33.917 --> 41:36.375
They're idiots, Zo.
They don't know anything.

41:36.458 --> 41:37.750
I know.

41:38.667 --> 41:39.708
I have to go find him.

41:40.292 --> 41:41.375
NOW?

41:41.833 --> 41:44.208
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I need to go.

41:48.708 --> 41:49.958
Hey!

42:07.833 --> 42:09.458
Another one!
Stop her too!

42:15.500 --> 42:16.875
Gotcha.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.417
Sit down.

42:26.208 --> 42:28.000
Empty your pockets.

42:34.583 --> 42:37.583
Well, I'd call that evidence,
wouldn't you?

42:38.417 --> 42:40.917
Name. Address.
Parents' phone numbers.

42:41.333 --> 42:42.667
Don't call my dad.

42:42.792 --> 42:44.167
We have a choice.

42:44.750 --> 42:46.958
We can call him,
or we can call the police.

42:47.083 --> 42:49.458
The police, every time.

42:50.167 --> 42:53.292
Now, I told that guy out there
I'd handle it, and if you...

42:53.375 --> 42:54.708
Listen...

43:00.917 --> 43:02.583
This is a portacath.

43:04.708 --> 43:07.000
It's an access disk
for medical treatments.

43:07.417 --> 43:09.833
I have acute
lymphoblastic leukemia.

43:10.375 --> 43:12.208
Please put your shirt back on.

43:12.667 --> 43:14.917
Do you know what acute
lymphoblastic leukemia is?

43:15.083 --> 43:16.792
No, I'm afraid I don't.

43:17.167 --> 43:18.333
It's cancer.

43:25.875 --> 43:28.208
I still have to call your dad.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.167
And you, what's your excuse?

43:34.125 --> 43:35.875
What did she take?

43:36.625 --> 43:39.208
One Clearblue
Home Pregnancy Test.

43:54.833 --> 43:58.208
Was this on the list?
Shoplifting?

44:05.125 --> 44:06.875
What are you doing, Tessa?

44:07.083 --> 44:08.083
What are you doing?

44:08.167 --> 44:09.500
As much as I can.
As fast as I can.

44:10.417 --> 44:11.917
I wish you'd stop.

44:12.292 --> 44:13.750
You'd prefer I spend
the rest of my life

44:13.792 --> 44:15.208
huddled in
a blanket on the sofa,

44:15.250 --> 44:16.750
with my head on your shoulder.

44:18.583 --> 44:20.625
Yeah, I would.
Can you blame me?

44:22.958 --> 44:24.458
Yes, I would.

44:28.750 --> 44:32.542
My point is... Well, my point
is, I like a strong woman.

44:32.625 --> 44:33.917
You've always wanted
to be carried to bed.

44:34.083 --> 44:36.042
I have always wanted
to be carried to bed.

44:36.125 --> 44:38.292
What I don't do,
is bring to a mate's party

44:38.375 --> 44:41.375
an, admittedly perfectly
formed, young pixie warlock.

44:41.625 --> 44:42.875
Yeah, she's isn't a warlock.

44:42.958 --> 44:44.167
I mean you can't just go around

44:44.208 --> 44:45.708
starting fights every which way

44:45.792 --> 44:47.083
and shaking
things up like that.

44:52.125 --> 44:53.958
Apparently you can.

45:05.417 --> 45:06.875
What are you doing here?

45:07.667 --> 45:09.333
I've been stalking you all day.

45:09.542 --> 45:12.417
I only just now plucked up
the courage to reveal myself.

45:12.500 --> 45:13.583
Really?

45:14.375 --> 45:15.500
No.

45:18.208 --> 45:20.708
My dad's in the health food store.
He could drive past.

45:24.542 --> 45:25.875
It's nice to see
your mates again.

45:28.625 --> 45:31.208
Yeah. Always a pleasure.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.208
Well,
I'll see you around, maybe.

45:42.333 --> 45:43.750
Sure, yeah.

45:48.833 --> 45:50.500
I know you're looking.

45:51.292 --> 45:52.583
I'm not looking.

45:53.583 --> 45:54.792
Liar.

46:02.708 --> 46:05.417
Perhaps you should think
about going back to school.

46:05.542 --> 46:07.583
A bit of
normality in your life.

46:07.667 --> 46:09.833
I'm not going back to school.

46:09.917 --> 46:12.208
There's got to be some perks
to terminal illness.

46:15.833 --> 46:17.292
I'm killing you, right?

46:18.583 --> 46:19.833
Every day.

46:23.750 --> 46:25.125
Watch out, mate.

46:26.042 --> 46:27.625
Bloody idiot.

46:30.208 --> 46:31.875
What's this guy up to?

46:46.667 --> 46:49.292
Tessa, where are you going?
Tessa?

46:52.917 --> 46:54.583
Tessa!

47:35.167 --> 47:36.708
That was good.

47:37.208 --> 47:39.125
A ride on a motorbike.

47:39.708 --> 47:41.667
Should have been on my list.

47:41.750 --> 47:43.542
What is? Name one.

47:44.708 --> 47:45.875
Fame.

47:47.958 --> 47:49.417
How famous do you want to be?

47:50.917 --> 47:54.625
Enough for the whole world
to stop what it's doing

47:54.708 --> 47:57.083
and personally come and say
goodbye to me when I die.

47:58.375 --> 47:59.958
I think it's good you're not
asking too much there.

48:02.750 --> 48:05.125
I just want to have my name
out there somewhere, you know.

48:07.542 --> 48:09.292
You don't have to worry
about being forgotten, Tess.

48:13.583 --> 48:14.792
Anything else?

48:22.375 --> 48:23.542
Yeah.

48:27.042 --> 48:28.833
What are you doing?

48:29.292 --> 48:30.583
I just thought of another.

48:32.667 --> 48:34.208
You're not gonna swim naked.

48:34.375 --> 48:36.917
No way. You think I'm crazy?

48:37.875 --> 48:39.083
Not naked.

48:40.833 --> 48:42.667
Tess! Tess!

48:55.875 --> 48:57.250
Okay, count of three, yeah?

48:57.792 --> 48:58.792
What?

48:58.875 --> 49:02.083
Just got to commit.
We just run in, full whack.

49:02.958 --> 49:04.500
Deal.
Right.

49:05.292 --> 49:07.208
Bollocks.
Here we go.

49:07.750 --> 49:10.083
One, two, three!

49:22.500 --> 49:24.292
You're evil! You are so evil!

49:24.792 --> 49:26.167
How is it?

49:26.417 --> 49:28.375
Yeah, actually really
gorgeous and lovely.

49:28.542 --> 49:29.542
Really?

49:29.625 --> 49:31.958
No. But go for it anyway.

49:32.667 --> 49:33.667
Come on,
what are you scared of?

49:34.417 --> 49:35.500
Nothing.

49:54.375 --> 49:56.083
Okay, okay.

50:03.667 --> 50:05.000
See, the great thing is,

50:05.042 --> 50:06.500
I have actually always wondered

50:06.583 --> 50:09.167
if it was possible to
dry yourself with a sock.

50:11.708 --> 50:13.042
Thanks for doing that with me.

50:14.125 --> 50:15.708
I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

50:21.250 --> 50:23.000
The stars are out.

50:24.875 --> 50:26.042
Yeah.

50:26.542 --> 50:28.083
See that group
of five up there?

50:28.167 --> 50:29.292
The kind of curved shape.

50:29.375 --> 50:30.833
See them? See them?

50:30.875 --> 50:31.875
Yeah.

50:32.958 --> 50:34.458
I've got no idea
what they're called.

50:45.833 --> 50:47.042
Goon.

50:49.917 --> 50:51.000
No.

50:54.542 --> 50:55.792
What?

50:57.792 --> 50:59.167
I'm sorry.

51:00.292 --> 51:02.042
Don't you like me?

51:04.292 --> 51:05.875
It's not that.

51:09.208 --> 51:10.625
I don't think I can handle it.

51:14.083 --> 51:15.167
I'll see you around.

51:15.458 --> 51:17.375
Tess... Tess, wait. Come on.

51:17.750 --> 51:18.792
Tessa, come on.

51:18.875 --> 51:19.958
No, I've made a mistake.

51:22.250 --> 51:24.292
What? What mistake?

51:27.417 --> 51:29.250
You can't save me.

52:29.875 --> 52:31.750
When you were a baby,

52:32.625 --> 52:35.708
me and your mum used to lie awake
at night watching you breathe.

52:39.625 --> 52:41.833
We were convinced
that if we stopped looking,

52:41.917 --> 52:44.042
you'd forget how to do it.

52:47.917 --> 52:50.375
As your kids get older, it's
a different kind of worry.

52:52.750 --> 52:54.583
It never ever goes.

52:57.375 --> 52:59.417
Please think about that.

53:03.542 --> 53:07.000
You know, I kind of prefer it
when you give me shit.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.125
Tessa?

53:21.042 --> 53:22.292
Tessa?

53:39.292 --> 53:40.458
Nurse!

53:40.542 --> 53:42.125
Here, darling.

53:45.833 --> 53:47.500
Okay, okay.

53:47.583 --> 53:49.792
We'll soon have
that cleared up.

53:49.875 --> 53:53.417
I'm sorry. Sorry.

53:53.667 --> 53:54.958
It's okay, darling.

53:56.750 --> 53:58.875
Hello, Tessa. How are you?

53:59.042 --> 54:00.208
Good.

54:00.708 --> 54:02.875
I think dignity's
overrated anyway.

54:05.333 --> 54:07.958
We performed some
tests last night.

54:08.208 --> 54:11.333
I'm afraid the cancer has
spread to your spinal fluid.

54:11.417 --> 54:13.708
Things are progressing more
quickly than we first thought.

54:14.042 --> 54:15.708
You've moved
further down the line.

54:17.875 --> 54:19.292
How much further?

54:22.542 --> 54:25.125
I would encourage you to
do the things you want to do.

54:30.167 --> 54:31.583
I'm trying.

54:35.458 --> 54:37.167
Enchanted Garden!

54:40.958 --> 54:42.583
Whoo!

54:44.375 --> 54:45.750
That was lovely.

54:45.958 --> 54:47.750
Boring. Do another.

54:48.292 --> 54:49.917
What do you want to do?
Should I do a rocket?

54:50.125 --> 54:51.167
Yes! Do a rocket!

54:51.375 --> 54:52.375
Okay.

54:53.500 --> 54:55.958
Remind me again
why you're here.

54:57.250 --> 55:00.042
Your father said he'd chop my
legs off if I didn't show up.

55:00.125 --> 55:01.333
Ready, everybody?

55:01.375 --> 55:03.000
Cover your ears,
this is gonna be aloud one.

55:04.458 --> 55:05.458
Oh!

55:10.667 --> 55:12.000
Okay.

55:13.167 --> 55:14.500
Okay?

55:14.958 --> 55:16.208
Okay.

55:20.083 --> 55:21.750
Not bad.
What else you got in there?

55:21.833 --> 55:23.958
Should I go for
a 21-shot Cascade?

55:24.042 --> 55:26.500
Yes, do the Cascade!
I'll count.

55:27.250 --> 55:29.583
Ready? Right, here we go.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.292
One, two, three...

55:36.375 --> 55:38.083
Three...

55:39.458 --> 55:43.083
- Four...
- Four, five...

55:45.292 --> 55:51.208
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

56:33.875 --> 56:35.083
Tessa...

56:36.875 --> 56:38.625
What's the worst
that can happen?

56:40.583 --> 56:42.000
It'll hurt.

56:43.625 --> 56:45.083
It already hurts.

57:03.042 --> 57:05.917
Zoey was right. I'm alive.

57:09.125 --> 57:10.708
I'm alive.

57:33.208 --> 57:35.458
Morning, Dad. Sleep well?

57:36.417 --> 57:38.500
Who are you? What have you
done with my daughter?

57:38.667 --> 57:39.958
Sit.

57:41.208 --> 57:43.250
Eat. Drink coffee.

57:57.708 --> 57:58.917
Dad, I want to
introduce someone.

57:59.208 --> 58:00.583
Oh, God.

58:00.667 --> 58:02.500
This is Adam. Adam, Dad.

58:02.583 --> 58:04.083
It's good to meet you, sir.

58:04.208 --> 58:05.708
You don't have to call him sir.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.583
Sir will be fine.

58:08.375 --> 58:09.875
Excellent. Who wants toast?

58:10.167 --> 58:11.625
You can go.

58:11.917 --> 58:13.208
And miss all the fun?

58:13.542 --> 58:14.833
It's all right, Tess.

58:22.542 --> 58:24.500
Sit down.
Yeah.

58:32.958 --> 58:34.333
It's a terrible day
in an man's life

58:34.375 --> 58:36.625
when his daughter
brings a boy home.

58:37.792 --> 58:41.042
I always thought if I killed the
first one, word would get around.

58:44.833 --> 58:45.833
Do you go to college?

58:45.875 --> 58:46.917
Yeah, I had a place.

58:47.083 --> 58:48.542
Then some stuff happened,
you know.

58:49.542 --> 58:52.250
I know what happened.
I'm sorry for your loss.

58:52.333 --> 58:53.750
Yeah.

58:54.042 --> 58:55.292
How is your mum doing?

58:55.375 --> 58:57.083
Some days she seems okay.
Yeah.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.542
I used to think
that about Tessa.

59:00.750 --> 59:01.875
You're aware of her condition?

59:01.958 --> 59:03.542
Yeah, she's told me everything.

59:04.167 --> 59:05.792
No, she hasn't.

59:06.833 --> 59:08.208
If she wants you to
find her attractive,

59:08.292 --> 59:12.125
then one thing she won't have
done is told you everything.

59:13.542 --> 59:14.542
How old are you?

59:15.250 --> 59:16.250
Why?

59:17.458 --> 59:19.375
Because at your age, you shouldn't
have to be nursing someone.

59:19.833 --> 59:20.875
Tessa doesn't need nursing.

59:20.917 --> 59:22.375
Yes, she does.

59:23.083 --> 59:25.250
And she will more and more.

59:25.833 --> 59:29.708
And you, my young friend, you're
simply not up to the task.

59:30.458 --> 59:31.792
So, why don't you
do us all a favor,

59:31.875 --> 59:33.292
and piss off out of
what's left of her life.

59:53.292 --> 59:55.000
So, how'd you get your dad
to lend you the car?

59:55.375 --> 59:58.125
I thought you weren't
speaking to him.

59:58.667 --> 01:00:01.583
I knew there was
a reason I forgot to ask.

01:00:04.125 --> 01:00:06.417
Well, thanks for bringing me.

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:08.417
I thought it
would be full of girls

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.000
holding tissues
and looking gutted.

01:00:11.625 --> 01:00:14.083
At least Scott
paid for privacy.

01:00:16.083 --> 01:00:17.833
He'll get over it.

01:00:18.583 --> 01:00:20.500
No, never.

01:00:21.708 --> 01:00:23.083
He never will. He hates me.

01:00:26.542 --> 01:00:27.792
Do you?

01:00:31.333 --> 01:00:32.750
I'm just talking to them today.

01:00:33.208 --> 01:00:34.292
About making
another appointment?

01:00:35.458 --> 01:00:39.750
Yes. Yeah,
I want it gone, all right?

01:00:40.708 --> 01:00:43.417
Zoey Walker?
We're ready for you now.

01:00:44.458 --> 01:00:45.750
I just want it gone.

01:00:57.875 --> 01:00:59.833
You hit that curb.

01:00:59.917 --> 01:01:02.292
Wasn't my fault. The
road should have been straight.

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:06.958
There you go.

01:01:08.667 --> 01:01:10.417
Tess, you know
I've got no choice.

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.167
You don't even know
what those words mean.

01:01:18.292 --> 01:01:20.583
Why did you come if you were
just going to disapprove?

01:01:21.167 --> 01:01:22.708
'Cause that's why you asked me.

01:01:47.458 --> 01:01:48.542
Hey.

01:01:50.542 --> 01:01:53.667
Evening.
That was my first drive.

01:01:54.042 --> 01:01:55.208
First ever?

01:01:56.542 --> 01:01:57.917
Well, then you did fantastic.

01:01:58.042 --> 01:01:59.458
You think?

01:01:59.708 --> 01:02:03.292
Yeah. Yeah, that's just how
changing gear is meant to sound.

01:02:03.375 --> 01:02:05.750
It's my dad's car.
Deserves what it gets.

01:02:06.417 --> 01:02:08.500
He's just trying
to keep you safe.

01:02:08.583 --> 01:02:10.833
I think that ship
has sailed, don't you?

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.750
Would you like to
go on a date with me?

01:02:19.792 --> 01:02:21.000
Just it occurred
to me we've never

01:02:21.083 --> 01:02:22.708
actually been on a date,
like a proper one,

01:02:22.792 --> 01:02:25.083
and I thought
that maybe we should.

01:02:25.125 --> 01:02:26.750
You know, it doesn't have
to be right tonight, like now,

01:02:26.833 --> 01:02:28.458
but, you know, the offer's
there, for anytime.

01:02:28.542 --> 01:02:30.417
You just let me
know when suits.

01:02:34.708 --> 01:02:35.792
Now is good.

01:02:45.792 --> 01:02:48.167
Christ, Tessa.
You could have called.

01:02:48.792 --> 01:02:49.958
What are you doing here?

01:02:50.042 --> 01:02:51.917
Dad and Cal are looking for you.
Where have you been?

01:02:52.667 --> 01:02:54.583
We'll have to talk
about it some other time.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:56.625
Why?

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.417
'Cause I've got a date.

01:03:04.833 --> 01:03:06.125
Yeah. She's here.

01:03:25.458 --> 01:03:27.958
Not tonight.
Please, not tonight.

01:03:28.042 --> 01:03:31.083
Okay, I've called your father. I've
told him not to worry. He's going...

01:03:32.292 --> 01:03:34.250
Oh, my God.
It's just a nosebleed.

01:03:34.708 --> 01:03:37.125
No, it's pumping out of you.
Tessa, I...

01:03:37.583 --> 01:03:39.500
What should I do?
I don't know...

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:41.333
Here, take a towel.

01:03:41.833 --> 01:03:44.500
Sit down.
Pinch your nose or something.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.958
Oh, you need to go to hospital.

01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:51.250
It'll stop in a minute.
I'm calling your father.

01:03:51.333 --> 01:03:53.583
Should I call your father?
I don't know what to do.

01:03:53.667 --> 01:03:55.417
Tell me what to do!
Just get me some ice.

01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:57.500
What?
Ice!

01:03:57.583 --> 01:03:59.917
A bag of frozen peas would
be best.

01:04:01.083 --> 01:04:02.958
Right. Frozen peas.

01:04:10.542 --> 01:04:13.750
There's sweet corn.
Is sweet corn okay?

01:04:14.792 --> 01:04:15.917
Oh, Jesus.

01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:17.458
You have to take me
to hospital.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.333
I can't, Tessa. I think
your father should do this.

01:04:20.417 --> 01:04:21.458
There isn't time.

01:04:21.542 --> 01:04:22.542
Okay.

01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:25.083
Yes. Ambulance, please.
Quickly. Quickly!

01:04:28.042 --> 01:04:29.417
Who is it?
No.

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.000
Who is it?
He can't...

01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:32.583
I need help.
Don't let him in.

01:04:32.625 --> 01:04:33.667
No, I need help.

01:04:33.708 --> 01:04:34.875
He can't see me like this!

01:04:34.917 --> 01:04:37.625
Tess, I can't do this
on my own. I need help.

01:04:59.083 --> 01:05:00.125
Coming.

01:05:00.208 --> 01:05:02.417
Help me get her downstairs.

01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:07.375
Come on. Are you gonna help?

01:05:07.542 --> 01:05:09.167
Get him out! Please.

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:11.250
All right, just go.
We can manage. Go.

01:05:19.417 --> 01:05:20.667
Would you hold that?

01:05:21.792 --> 01:05:23.250
Thank you.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.625
Adam.

01:05:33.292 --> 01:05:35.292
She must be thirsty.
She's lost so much blood.

01:05:35.375 --> 01:05:36.917
Should she have some water?
Should she?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.167
Let's see what the doctor
says, all right.

01:05:40.625 --> 01:05:42.417
Good. Here you are.

01:05:44.792 --> 01:05:48.167
Right. Any signs of
thrombocytopenia before today?

01:05:49.125 --> 01:05:51.042
Mum? Mum?

01:05:51.167 --> 01:05:53.083
Sorry, me?

01:05:53.125 --> 01:05:54.708
Has she complained
of a headache?

01:05:54.792 --> 01:05:56.583
Have you noticed
any pinprick bruising?

01:05:56.667 --> 01:05:58.125
I didn't look, to be honest.

01:05:58.208 --> 01:06:00.292
When was the last
platelet transfusion?

01:06:00.375 --> 01:06:02.458
I'm not sure. I can try...
I can try and find out.

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:05.250
Has she used any aspirin
products recently?

01:06:05.333 --> 01:06:06.583
I don't know. I don't...

01:06:06.667 --> 01:06:08.917
I'm sorry. I don't know the answers
to any of these questions.

01:06:08.958 --> 01:06:11.500
My last platelet transfusion
was May 18th.

01:06:11.583 --> 01:06:13.708
Okay, thank you. Don't talk.

01:06:13.792 --> 01:06:17.750
Mum, get yourself round here,
and hold your daughter's hand.

01:06:17.917 --> 01:06:21.667
Okay. Squeeze your mum's hand
once for yes, twice for no.

01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:23.792
Understand? Don't talk.

01:06:24.167 --> 01:06:25.292
Yes.

01:06:25.375 --> 01:06:28.667
Any signs of thrombocytopenia?
Headaches? Bruising?

01:06:29.292 --> 01:06:30.375
No.

01:06:30.458 --> 01:06:33.750
Aspirin products? Bonjela? Teejel?
Anti-inflammatories?

01:06:33.792 --> 01:06:34.917
No, none of those. No.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.083
Good.

01:06:36.375 --> 01:06:38.375
Now I'm afraid we're going to
need to cauterize your nose.

01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:40.958
Have you been cauterized before?
Yes, she has.

01:06:41.042 --> 01:06:42.792
Okay.
We'll check your platelets,

01:06:42.875 --> 01:06:45.750
and then you're going to need
at least a couple of units.

01:06:45.833 --> 01:06:48.583
A rough night, but you'll be
back home tomorrow.

01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:51.958
We got there in the end.

01:07:13.917 --> 01:07:17.792
They said it was a posterior nosebleed, the...
You know, the bad kind.

01:07:20.708 --> 01:07:24.625
They had to pack
her nose with vaso...

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:26.792
Vasoconstrictive.

01:07:26.875 --> 01:07:29.042
Yeah, vasoconstrictive agents.

01:07:29.083 --> 01:07:32.417
And before they transfused in two
units, they did a platelet count.

01:07:33.542 --> 01:07:34.667
And?

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:36.542
Stable.

01:07:46.625 --> 01:07:48.125
You did well.

01:07:52.708 --> 01:07:54.625
I'm here,
you can go now if you want.

01:07:57.875 --> 01:07:58.958
Can I stay?

01:08:03.833 --> 01:08:05.083
Yeah.

01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:51.582
How are you feeling?

01:08:52.542 --> 01:08:53.917
Sleepy...

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:55.917
Thank you for being there.

01:08:58.125 --> 01:09:01.500
It was a bit of a shock.
For your boy, too.

01:09:02.832 --> 01:09:04.292
It was understandable.

01:09:10.582 --> 01:09:12.207
He's a hot buttered biscuit,
that one.

01:09:14.792 --> 01:09:17.250
Yeah, that's exactly
how I'd describe him.

01:09:17.542 --> 01:09:19.332
What would you say?

01:09:21.707 --> 01:09:24.582
When he's not with me,
I think I've made him up.

01:09:27.125 --> 01:09:29.167
He didn't call or come
after us, or anything?

01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:32.332
No.

01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:36.125
Maybe I did make him up.

01:09:40.207 --> 01:09:41.500
Good God.

01:09:42.832 --> 01:09:43.875
What?

01:09:44.082 --> 01:09:46.000
There, on the bridge.

01:09:53.125 --> 01:09:54.583
That's odd.

01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:03.417
You're everywhere, Tessa!

01:10:22.167 --> 01:10:23.583
He's done it.

01:10:26.125 --> 01:10:28.083
He's put my name in the world.

01:10:39.292 --> 01:10:41.417
Juggling clubs!
You brought me juggling clubs!

01:10:42.083 --> 01:10:43.292
Happy birthday.

01:10:43.375 --> 01:10:44.458
Can you do these?

01:10:44.833 --> 01:10:46.167
Yeah. A bit, yeah.

01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:47.917
I'll help you
practice later if you want.

01:10:48.333 --> 01:10:50.042
Dad, can Adam stay for dinner?

01:10:50.208 --> 01:10:51.250
No.

01:10:51.958 --> 01:10:53.042
Mum...

01:10:53.125 --> 01:10:54.292
I don't live here, do I?

01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:56.250
Thank you.

01:10:56.333 --> 01:10:57.458
But let him stay.

01:10:57.958 --> 01:10:59.417
It's a conspiracy.

01:11:01.292 --> 01:11:03.458
All right,
on with the magic show.

01:11:03.542 --> 01:11:04.625
Pick a card.

01:11:07.208 --> 01:11:08.250
Five of hearts.

01:11:08.542 --> 01:11:09.583
No.

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:12.125
One day I'll get the right one,

01:11:12.250 --> 01:11:13.625
and you'll all crap yourselves.

01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:16.375
Oh, nice. He's allowed
to say that, is he?

01:11:16.458 --> 01:11:18.208
It's only "crap."

01:11:42.917 --> 01:11:44.875
Well, that's another
one to cross off the list.

01:11:49.542 --> 01:11:51.250
How's the list going?

01:11:52.042 --> 01:11:55.750
Things I thought mattered
don't matter so much anymore.

01:11:57.375 --> 01:12:00.125
How about you? Got anything
you wanna put up there?

01:12:01.542 --> 01:12:02.917
I'm fine.

01:12:04.875 --> 01:12:07.583
I mean, there are
things I've kind of,

01:12:07.667 --> 01:12:10.708
you know, opted out of I guess.

01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:16.792
No, I'm not like you like that.

01:12:16.875 --> 01:12:18.875
I don't...

01:12:19.542 --> 01:12:20.583
Adam?

01:12:20.708 --> 01:12:21.792
Yeah.

01:12:23.375 --> 01:12:25.708
You've got to get in the game.

01:12:28.875 --> 01:12:30.875
So have a think.

01:12:31.875 --> 01:12:36.042
What are your hopes,
your dreams?

01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:40.917
Right now?

01:12:41.625 --> 01:12:42.792
Yeah.

01:12:52.083 --> 01:12:54.208
Let go of my hand.
Let go of my hand.

01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:55.750
I'll wipe out.

01:12:55.833 --> 01:12:57.375
Yeah, but I'll be miles away.

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:01.375
Go on, all the way across.
Just lean forward and run.

01:13:01.417 --> 01:13:03.042
You can do it.

01:13:03.708 --> 01:13:05.292
Lean and run, got it.

01:13:08.042 --> 01:13:10.792
Get in!
Tessa Scott is in the house!

01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:15.958
Cal, how do you stop?

01:13:16.042 --> 01:13:17.042
Use the wall.

01:13:17.125 --> 01:13:18.917
Cal!
Use the wall!

01:13:21.708 --> 01:13:22.875
Hi, babe.

01:13:23.542 --> 01:13:24.792
Hey.

01:13:28.292 --> 01:13:29.875
You looked good out there.

01:13:30.375 --> 01:13:33.458
I kept falling down.
My bum hurts.

01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:36.583
You should put some ice on it.

01:13:42.708 --> 01:13:44.083
I'm keeping the baby.

01:13:48.875 --> 01:13:50.083
Really?

01:13:51.708 --> 01:13:54.208
Yeah. Yes.

01:13:56.375 --> 01:13:59.750
It's a girl.
I'm having a girl.

01:14:02.208 --> 01:14:04.583
And I'm gonna call her Lauren.

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:07.208
That's what I'm gonna do.

01:14:08.375 --> 01:14:10.208
I want to be there.

01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:13.000
If you don't want me
in the birth,

01:14:13.042 --> 01:14:14.792
then I can sit outside
and come in afterwards.

01:14:18.583 --> 01:14:19.958
I want to be one
of the first people

01:14:20.042 --> 01:14:22.042
in the world to
ever hold your baby.

01:14:26.375 --> 01:14:28.250
It's five months away.

01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:31.625
Then it's something to aim for.

01:15:02.875 --> 01:15:05.583
You see, some people would
find this beautiful.

01:15:05.708 --> 01:15:08.042
But all I can think is, it's
killing my poor vegetables.

01:15:11.375 --> 01:15:13.250
Hey, what's up, Tess?

01:15:14.708 --> 01:15:17.917
It's not enough. Us. This.

01:15:18.917 --> 01:15:20.458
How do you mean?

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:24.083
Stay with me. Stay the nights.

01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:29.125
What do you want from me, Tess?

01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:35.917
Nighttime. Sleeping together.
Waking up together. Breakfast.

01:15:38.125 --> 01:15:40.208
What do you really want?

01:15:44.875 --> 01:15:46.625
I want you to be
with me in the dark.

01:15:49.042 --> 01:15:50.542
To hold me.

01:15:52.083 --> 01:15:53.875
To keep loving me.

01:15:57.458 --> 01:15:59.750
To help me when I get scared.

01:16:02.792 --> 01:16:05.917
To come right to the edge
and see what's there.

01:16:11.583 --> 01:16:13.583
What if I get it wrong?

01:16:14.917 --> 01:16:17.250
It's impossible to get wrong.

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.417
For you.

01:16:40.542 --> 01:16:42.292
It's a snow angel.

01:16:50.708 --> 01:16:53.083
<i>No. No, no and no.</i>

01:16:53.292 --> 01:16:55.083
Dad...
Is this on the list?

01:16:55.208 --> 01:16:58.208
A boy staying over?
Forget it. No.

01:16:58.750 --> 01:17:00.292
You know, this is
not easy for me to ask.

01:17:00.542 --> 01:17:02.375
Well, it's very easy
for me to answer.

01:17:03.375 --> 01:17:05.125
I thought you wanted to talk.
Not about this.

01:17:05.375 --> 01:17:07.208
I won't permit it.
End of discussion.

01:17:07.917 --> 01:17:09.042
Don't pull rank on me.

01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:11.583
I have rank. I'm your father.

01:17:13.375 --> 01:17:15.208
Not for much longer.

01:17:23.958 --> 01:17:25.542
Are you ready?

01:17:25.583 --> 01:17:27.625
It's too far.

01:17:27.708 --> 01:17:28.708
Just jump.

01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:30.417
It's too bloody far.

01:17:31.042 --> 01:17:32.208
Good night then.

01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:33.958
Wait.

01:17:35.583 --> 01:17:36.625
What are you doing?

01:17:36.875 --> 01:17:37.875
Psyching myself up.

01:17:37.917 --> 01:17:39.083
Oh, is that gonna take a while,

01:17:39.208 --> 01:17:40.375
'cause I quite
fancy a cup of tea.

01:17:41.708 --> 01:17:42.958
Oh, my God.

01:17:45.042 --> 01:17:46.625
Are you all right?
No.

01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:48.083
I've broken my arm.

01:17:48.625 --> 01:17:49.625
Both arms.

01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:52.083
I've broken everything.

01:17:54.708 --> 01:17:56.625
Hi.
Hi.

01:17:57.833 --> 01:17:58.833
Ow.

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:01.583
But you're here.

01:18:37.417 --> 01:18:38.917
He's in there, isn't he?

01:18:44.208 --> 01:18:45.375
Yes.

01:18:46.875 --> 01:18:49.042
I told you I didn't want that.

01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:51.917
I know.

01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:54.208
You know why?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.167
I think so.

01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:59.250
He's a good kid, Tessa.

01:18:59.708 --> 01:19:02.542
But a kid is all he is.
You can't rely on him.

01:19:02.583 --> 01:19:03.917
He might let you down.

01:19:05.417 --> 01:19:06.542
He won't.

01:19:07.875 --> 01:19:09.583
What if he does?

01:19:12.042 --> 01:19:16.542
Then I'll still have you.
Like always.

01:19:37.583 --> 01:19:39.583
These are insanely good.

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:41.458
I think they fry
the onions in hair oil.

01:19:42.708 --> 01:19:44.708
Because we're worth it.

01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:56.917
I wish I could do that.

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:58.125
You can't?

01:19:58.708 --> 01:19:59.792
No.

01:19:59.875 --> 01:20:02.208
I can do like two
and then they just die.

01:20:02.250 --> 01:20:03.875
I'll teach you.

01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:06.417
I'll put it on my new list.

01:20:07.042 --> 01:20:08.625
Along with what?

01:20:10.708 --> 01:20:11.958
Too many things.

01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:18.625
Spring. Daffodils and tulips.

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:22.417
A long train journey.

01:20:23.875 --> 01:20:25.250
A peacock.

01:20:25.917 --> 01:20:27.750
Bed and breakfast.

01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:29.792
A joint bank account.

01:20:30.375 --> 01:20:32.708
Listening to you
snore for years and years.

01:20:33.083 --> 01:20:34.500
I don't snore. Do I snore?

01:20:34.875 --> 01:20:35.958
You will when you get old.

01:20:37.542 --> 01:20:40.792
To go to a parents' evening,
and our child's a genius.

01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:43.083
Actually,
all three of our kids.

01:20:43.208 --> 01:20:44.292
We're having three?

01:20:44.375 --> 01:20:45.917
Chester, Merlin and Daisy.

01:20:47.292 --> 01:20:48.875
God help them.

01:20:50.083 --> 01:20:52.958
Being with you.
Being with you.

01:20:54.042 --> 01:20:55.750
Being with you.

01:20:57.208 --> 01:20:59.250
Just being with you.

01:21:02.708 --> 01:21:05.042
So, is the love cure
still working its magic?

01:21:05.083 --> 01:21:06.208
You tell me.

01:21:06.958 --> 01:21:08.542
I should recommend it
to all my patients.

01:21:08.583 --> 01:21:10.208
Yes! I got a text.

01:21:10.917 --> 01:21:12.333
Cal's got a mobile phone.

01:21:12.458 --> 01:21:13.917
He's growing up.

01:21:13.958 --> 01:21:15.042
Year Five won!

01:21:15.083 --> 01:21:16.292
There was a water
fight in the park

01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:18.208
against Year Seven, and we won!

01:21:18.958 --> 01:21:20.792
Cal, tell Philippa what
you've been doing recently.

01:21:21.625 --> 01:21:23.625
Oh, yeah. I'm doing "keep
death away" spells.

01:21:23.958 --> 01:21:25.917
I've put garlic
above all the doors

01:21:26.042 --> 01:21:28.042
and at the four
corners of Tessa's bed.

01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:31.208
Which is pretty bloody gross,
but I figure...

01:21:33.125 --> 01:21:34.250
What?

01:21:35.875 --> 01:21:37.083
What is it?

01:21:42.542 --> 01:21:43.708
Tessa?

01:21:46.542 --> 01:21:47.708
Where's your father?

01:21:48.958 --> 01:21:52.792
Telling my mum something.
What's he telling her?

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:57.417
Let's wait for them
to join us, shall we?

01:21:57.875 --> 01:22:01.042
It's me that's sick, not them.

01:22:03.958 --> 01:22:05.708
How sick, please?

01:22:10.042 --> 01:22:12.583
Your latest
blood counts are very low.

01:22:14.583 --> 01:22:17.125
Your immune system
is in collapse.

01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:22.083
The cancer is now everywhere.

01:22:25.625 --> 01:22:27.750
How much longer do I have?

01:22:29.125 --> 01:22:31.417
I don't want to be
drawn into time scales.

01:22:33.375 --> 01:22:35.375
I won't sue you
if you're wrong.

01:22:39.375 --> 01:22:41.750
My best friend's due in April.

01:22:43.708 --> 01:22:45.583
Will I get to meet her baby?

01:22:51.375 --> 01:22:52.417
No.

01:23:30.417 --> 01:23:31.833
Adam?

01:23:47.917 --> 01:23:49.042
Is Adam here?

01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:52.000
Oh, no, I'm sorry, darling. He
won't be back till this evening.

01:23:52.708 --> 01:23:54.875
That's too late.
Where's he gone?

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.667
He's on the train.
For the Open Day.

01:23:59.875 --> 01:24:02.417
Open Day?
Yeah, at the university.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.542
I was so thrilled
when he said he was

01:24:04.708 --> 01:24:06.250
taking up his
place in September.

01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:08.417
There were times when I thought

01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:09.917
we'd be waiting
another 12 months.

01:24:10.667 --> 01:24:14.333
No one wants to be the oldest
kid in the class, do they?

01:24:15.542 --> 01:24:19.208
No. No one wants that.

01:25:28.083 --> 01:25:29.417
Tessa?

01:25:31.167 --> 01:25:33.042
Tessa, are you here?

01:25:37.542 --> 01:25:38.917
Darling?

01:25:46.333 --> 01:25:47.500
No.

01:25:49.917 --> 01:25:51.208
You monster.

01:25:54.375 --> 01:25:56.750
Do you want to
leave me with nothing?

01:26:03.208 --> 01:26:06.750
Is this it? The list.

01:26:10.042 --> 01:26:11.333
It was here all along.

01:26:15.208 --> 01:26:17.250
Why didn't you show me?

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.375
You should've shown me.

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:23.667
Some of these,
I could've helped you.

01:26:24.375 --> 01:26:26.542
I just wanted to help you.

01:26:27.375 --> 01:26:28.875
I couldn't help you.

01:26:30.083 --> 01:26:31.417
I can't help you.

01:26:33.208 --> 01:26:36.042
I don't want you to go.

01:26:37.042 --> 01:26:39.250
I don't want you to go.

01:26:39.375 --> 01:26:40.917
I can't bear it.

01:26:41.417 --> 01:26:43.208
Take me with you.

01:26:43.875 --> 01:26:45.417
Oh, please...

01:26:46.042 --> 01:26:49.042
I don't want you to go.

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:52.042
I don't want you to go.

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:54.833
Oh, baby...

01:26:56.167 --> 01:26:58.042
Oh, you're my baby...

01:27:27.708 --> 01:27:30.583
Jesus, Tess,
I've been looking all over.

01:27:30.917 --> 01:27:32.333
How long have you been up here?

01:27:33.417 --> 01:27:35.250
Why didn't you tell me?

01:27:39.250 --> 01:27:40.375
You can't be making
that walk, right?

01:27:40.458 --> 01:27:41.542
Just come back with me, please.

01:27:41.833 --> 01:27:43.833
Why didn't you tell me?

01:27:46.208 --> 01:27:48.000
Because it's gonna be me!

01:27:48.042 --> 01:27:50.042
It's gonna be me that's
left behind on my own.

01:27:50.083 --> 01:27:51.583
Don't you dare feel
sorry for yourself

01:27:51.708 --> 01:27:53.208
because you get to stay behind.

01:27:53.250 --> 01:27:54.583
Don't you fucking dare!

01:27:54.708 --> 01:27:56.000
This is what you wanted.

01:27:56.833 --> 01:27:58.708
Come on, I know it.
This is what you wanted.

01:27:58.750 --> 01:28:00.083
For me to go on and...

01:28:00.875 --> 01:28:03.208
Oh, please,
you've got to know that

01:28:03.375 --> 01:28:04.958
if it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be able

01:28:05.042 --> 01:28:07.833
to go anywhere or do anything.

01:28:07.875 --> 01:28:10.542
Except, I don't know,
fucking garden.

01:28:31.542 --> 01:28:33.042
It's going to happen.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.208
I know.

01:28:38.542 --> 01:28:39.708
Soon.

01:28:43.417 --> 01:28:44.917
All right?

01:28:53.667 --> 01:28:55.417
So what was it like there?

01:28:58.708 --> 01:29:01.667
Big, lots of buildings.
I got a bit lost.

01:29:03.042 --> 01:29:04.917
We'll figure it out.

01:29:06.583 --> 01:29:08.417
We will?
Yeah.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.542
I'm coming back
as somebody else.

01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:15.583
I'll be the wild-haired girl
that walks up to you on day one,

01:29:15.708 --> 01:29:18.042
and ask what you're studying.

01:29:19.875 --> 01:29:23.042
And I'll fall in love
with you at first sight.

01:29:23.667 --> 01:29:24.875
Again.

01:31:00.542 --> 01:31:02.542
Tell me how it will be.

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.375
You won't want to
eat much from now on.

01:31:11.875 --> 01:31:13.708
You'll be thirsty.

01:31:14.542 --> 01:31:16.833
And sometimes feverish.

01:31:19.917 --> 01:31:22.208
<i>You'll want to sleep a lot.</i>

01:31:22.708 --> 01:31:25.500
<i>You'll have
little or no energy.</i>

01:31:27.042 --> 01:31:28.417
<i>Will it hurt?</i>

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:33.250
No. The morphine will make
sure you're not in any pain.

01:31:35.083 --> 01:31:36.917
It will give you
some beautiful dreams.

01:31:41.708 --> 01:31:43.083
Hi, there.

01:31:44.542 --> 01:31:46.417
I keep thinking
I've met your baby.

01:31:51.083 --> 01:31:52.417
How is she?

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.208
Gorgeous.

01:31:58.667 --> 01:32:00.083
You'll love her.

01:32:07.375 --> 01:32:08.625
Is this happening?

01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:10.083
Yeah.

01:32:13.542 --> 01:32:15.208
I don't know what's real.

01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:17.667
I am.

01:32:21.708 --> 01:32:24.083
<i>Do you think I'll be scared?</i>

01:32:26.208 --> 01:32:28.917
<i>I think you've had
the worst luck in the world,</i>

01:32:29.042 --> 01:32:32.208
<i>and if I was in your shoes,
I would be scared.</i>

01:32:37.667 --> 01:32:41.500
But I also believe that however
you handle these last few days

01:32:41.542 --> 01:32:44.417
will be exactly as
it should be done.

01:32:45.167 --> 01:32:47.083
I hate it when you say days.

01:32:54.083 --> 01:32:58.083
<i>Quite soon you'll start to drift
in and out of consciousness.</i>

01:33:00.708 --> 01:33:02.542
<i>Sometimes you won't
be able to respond,</i>

01:33:02.583 --> 01:33:06.333
<i>but you'll know people are
there, you'll hear them talk.</i>

01:33:06.375 --> 01:33:08.750
Thank you for staying with her.

01:33:10.375 --> 01:33:11.833
I love her.

01:33:14.875 --> 01:33:18.750
And eventually,
Tess, you'll just drift away.

01:33:21.417 --> 01:33:22.917
Do you have any
other questions?

01:33:27.333 --> 01:33:29.083
No. No.

01:33:41.042 --> 01:33:42.542
You're awake.

01:33:42.875 --> 01:33:45.042
Just getting an ice lolly.

01:33:45.083 --> 01:33:47.250
Why didn't you ring the bell?

01:33:47.708 --> 01:33:49.375
Still looking for a cure?

01:33:51.708 --> 01:33:53.208
Pain relief.

01:33:57.708 --> 01:33:59.208
Can I use
the computer for a sec?

01:34:00.042 --> 01:34:01.667
Yeah. Of course.

01:34:01.708 --> 01:34:03.375
No, you're good.

01:34:12.042 --> 01:34:14.208
Your hair's growing back.

01:34:15.042 --> 01:34:16.792
Not quick enough.

01:34:19.167 --> 01:34:21.458
What are you showing me here?

01:34:22.708 --> 01:34:24.125
A better site for you.

01:34:24.792 --> 01:34:26.042
Jobs.

01:34:26.125 --> 01:34:27.625
You've got to start thinking.

01:34:30.167 --> 01:34:31.458
Not yet.

01:34:34.208 --> 01:34:36.625
You're gonna have a life again.

01:34:37.125 --> 01:34:39.583
I never had a life.

01:34:39.625 --> 01:34:41.292
I was an accountant.

01:34:43.708 --> 01:34:45.958
And now you can do anything.

01:34:47.875 --> 01:34:49.375
I'm telling Tessa and Dad,

01:34:49.458 --> 01:34:50.667
and then everyone else I know.

01:34:50.792 --> 01:34:52.500
Because I don't.
Mum fancies Mr. Wilmot.

01:34:52.542 --> 01:34:53.792
I do not. I never said that.

01:34:53.917 --> 01:34:55.250
You did, you did.

01:34:55.292 --> 01:34:57.083
Mum fancies Mr. Wilmot.

01:34:57.167 --> 01:34:59.500
All the mums fancy Mr. Wilmot.

01:34:59.792 --> 01:35:01.708
And a few of the dads.

01:35:03.167 --> 01:35:04.625
Hey. How are you feeling?

01:35:05.125 --> 01:35:06.625
Where have you been?

01:35:06.708 --> 01:35:09.833
I have been to
a parent-teacher meeting.

01:35:10.333 --> 01:35:11.542
You went to that?

01:35:12.042 --> 01:35:13.500
She did.
Yeah.

01:35:13.542 --> 01:35:15.208
And it bored the hole off me.

01:35:15.375 --> 01:35:17.042
Except for Mr. Wilmot?

01:35:17.708 --> 01:35:19.875
He said I was doing
great, so Mum got me this.

01:35:20.625 --> 01:35:22.542
You spin it round
and it kind of sings.

01:35:22.625 --> 01:35:24.500
Yeah,
but not in the house, right?

01:35:25.708 --> 01:35:27.125
How come you're up?

01:35:27.958 --> 01:35:29.292
Are you sweating?

01:35:31.542 --> 01:35:32.750
I'll change your
sheets for you.

01:35:32.875 --> 01:35:34.125
I'll do it.

01:35:34.208 --> 01:35:35.375
I can make a bed.

01:35:35.458 --> 01:35:37.667
You wouldn't know a hospital
corner if it bit you on the arse.

01:35:37.708 --> 01:35:39.208
That is not true.

01:35:39.292 --> 01:35:40.792
Fine, I'll do it outside.

01:35:40.875 --> 01:35:43.000
Come and have a listen, Tess.
It kind of sings.

01:35:56.208 --> 01:36:00.042
I'm coming.
Be there in a second.

01:36:27.458 --> 01:36:29.500
It's gonna be all right.

01:36:54.167 --> 01:36:55.333
Adam!

01:36:55.375 --> 01:36:56.542
Yes, beautiful.

01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:59.458
Don't let me fall.
I've got you.

01:37:00.708 --> 01:37:01.750
I'm falling.

01:37:01.833 --> 01:37:03.583
You're not falling.
You're not falling.

01:37:14.542 --> 01:37:16.333
<i>Moments...</i>

01:37:20.542 --> 01:37:23.042
<i>Our life is
a series of moments.</i>
