00:01.335 --> 00:03.337
NARRATOR: Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island.

00:03.371 --> 00:05.406
This is my brother,
Rick Restall.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.308
-MARTY: He's coming back
to the island. -Welcome back.

00:07.341 --> 00:10.144
RICK: The Restalls said
there was a spiral staircase.

00:10.178 --> 00:12.080
Oh, there's something!

00:12.113 --> 00:14.448
-What is it?
-It's the end of a gun.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.784
-TERRY: He's in a void.
-Could be the spiral tunnel.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.319
MARTY: We're closing in.
We're close.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.620
RICK:
And now we're at the cusp

00:19.653 --> 00:21.189
of proving this story.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.557
-(explosion)
-Holy (bleep)!

00:23.591 --> 00:25.193
-RICK: Somebody got hurt.
-You get close,

00:25.226 --> 00:26.727
then all of a sudden
something happens.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.196
Oak Island strikes back.

00:30.464 --> 00:34.668
NARRATOR: There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:34.702 --> 00:37.805
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:37.838 --> 00:40.741
for more than 200 years.

00:40.774 --> 00:44.745
So far, they have found
bits of gold chain,

00:44.778 --> 00:49.183
a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it...

00:49.217 --> 00:52.286
even a 17th century
Spanish coin.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.123
To date, six men have died

00:55.156 --> 00:57.725
trying to solve the mystery.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.294
And, according to legend,

01:00.328 --> 01:03.331
one more will have to die

01:03.364 --> 01:06.267
before the treasure
can be found.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.536
*

01:20.914 --> 01:23.684
After a week
that saw the Oak Island team

01:23.717 --> 01:26.720
overcome a number
of frustrating obstacles...

01:38.432 --> 01:40.868
"Metal detecting is acceptable

01:40.901 --> 01:44.505
"as long as we are very clear
this does not include excavation

01:44.538 --> 01:45.739
or removal of objects."

01:45.773 --> 01:47.375
This is really bad.

01:47.408 --> 01:48.876
This is shutting down

01:48.909 --> 01:50.711
-the whole island.
-The whole island.

01:50.744 --> 01:53.681
...the business
of trying to solve

01:53.714 --> 01:59.420
a 222-year-old treasure mystery
has finally returned to normal.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.222
Where are we?
Where are we, though?

02:01.255 --> 02:02.656
Oh, right here.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.726
Supposedly in the middle
of the Chappell Shaft.

02:05.759 --> 02:09.697
Today, Rick Lagina,
along with Dave Blankenship

02:09.730 --> 02:12.333
and island historian
Charles Barkhouse,

02:12.366 --> 02:14.668
are overseeing
the team's progress

02:14.702 --> 02:19.473
on their extensive search
to find the original Money Pit.

02:19.507 --> 02:22.443
We go at it systematically like
we're doing, we can't miss it.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.313
But I think
we stay the course and...

02:25.346 --> 02:27.548
and work that area there.

02:27.581 --> 02:32.586
To date, 16 of some 40
six-inch-wide boreholes

02:32.620 --> 02:36.424
have been drilled using what is
known as the Geotech method.

02:36.457 --> 02:39.260
It is hoped that by drilling
a large number

02:39.293 --> 02:41.429
of these
strategically placed holes

02:41.462 --> 02:44.598
down to depths
of as much as 200 feet,

02:44.632 --> 02:47.801
the team will-- after carefully
sifting through the spoils

02:47.835 --> 02:50.404
and then metal-detecting
the holes--

02:50.438 --> 02:55.376
be able to find evidence of the
original Oak Island Money Pit.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.578
We went through a section of...

02:57.611 --> 02:59.247
the Chappell Shaft,

02:59.280 --> 03:01.515
with the wood cribbing
on the side,

03:01.549 --> 03:03.951
probably the south side,
I would guess.

03:06.454 --> 03:09.823
Today the team is drilling down
to what they believe

03:09.857 --> 03:13.794
is the site of what is known
as the Chappell Shaft,

03:13.827 --> 03:16.764
a searcher shaft
dug in the 1930s

03:16.797 --> 03:18.566
by M.R. Chappell,

03:18.599 --> 03:21.235
the son of famed
Oak Island treasure hunter

03:21.269 --> 03:23.237
William Chappell.

03:23.271 --> 03:26.840
By drilling into and then past
the Chappell Shaft,

03:26.874 --> 03:30.010
the team believes they will
be able to find the location

03:30.043 --> 03:32.380
of the so-called
"Chappell Vault,"

03:32.413 --> 03:35.449
the mysterious
seven-foot-tall wooden box

03:35.483 --> 03:40.754
that William Chappell
first discovered in 1897.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.956
A target object
that might contain anything

03:42.990 --> 03:44.792
from pirate treasure

03:44.825 --> 03:48.396
to priceless religious
and cultural artifacts.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.364
RICK:
We find the original Money Pit,

03:50.398 --> 03:51.932
and at that point,

03:51.965 --> 03:54.468
we can unleash the hounds,
if you will--

03:54.502 --> 03:59.873
expose the actual works of
a 222-year-old treasure hunt.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.910
The Money Pit is nothing
but an educated guess.

04:02.943 --> 04:06.614
-So we hit bedrock.
-Where are we at?

04:06.647 --> 04:09.383
We're at 168.

04:09.417 --> 04:12.353
Well, I don't know
if Terry wants information

04:12.386 --> 04:15.556
down at bedrock--
let me just check.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.025
-Terry? They're at bedrock.
-168, Terry.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.294
-Yeah.
-168.

04:20.328 --> 04:22.596
-Do you want to case down
to 210? -That's pretty deep.

04:22.630 --> 04:26.567
So that's well below
our 150 to 155.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.904
-Then you're advocating for...
to stop. -Stop.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.307
It's a consensus
of opinion here.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.609
Let me give Craig a call
and tell him.

04:35.643 --> 04:40.548
NARRATOR: Because the drill bit
has struck bedrock at 168 feet,

04:40.581 --> 04:42.850
15 feet deeper
than the last known location

04:42.883 --> 04:45.052
of the Chappell Vault,

04:45.085 --> 04:48.889
further drilling in this hole
now seems pointless.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.958
RICK:
We're fine, we're done.

04:50.991 --> 04:54.828
But because the hole
had held such high promise,

04:54.862 --> 04:57.665
I decided I'd call Craig
and get his confirmation

04:57.698 --> 05:00.834
that we should, uh...
cease operations.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.536
-Hello?
-Yeah, Craig,

05:02.570 --> 05:06.840
we're in the second hole
in the Chappell Shaft.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.609
-We hit...
-Uh-huh.

05:08.642 --> 05:12.680
...we hit bedrock
at right around 168 feet.

05:12.713 --> 05:16.884
Terry's advocating maybe
we should cease on that hole.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.738
Terry.

05:37.771 --> 05:41.509
Ivan just warned me
that he hit a void.

05:41.542 --> 05:44.077
-He's hit a void, for sure?
-For sure, yeah.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.046
That would have to be me,

05:46.079 --> 05:47.548
'cause I'm known to her.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.116
-You know, she may...
-Okay.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.051
-she may be disinclined,
then, at some point... -Rick.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.820
Hang on. Terry's here.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.789
Rick, we, uh,
Ivan says he went into a void.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.459
At 166, he went into some rock,

05:58.492 --> 06:03.931
and then at 160, about 69,
he dropped into a void.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.699
Yeah. That changes things.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.100
It changes things quite a bit.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.069
I just think we keep going here
on this one.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.505
-Let's get him going, then.
-Yeah. Okay?

06:11.539 --> 06:13.173
So, we'll, uh,
we'll leave it at that.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.042
We'll just roll on that, okay?
See you later, Craig.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.810
RICK:
Ivan tells Terry

06:16.844 --> 06:19.747
that we've broken through
into a void.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.416
And, of course... then game on.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.818
NARRATOR: Encountering a void
below the bedrock

06:24.852 --> 06:26.687
offers a significant
development

06:26.720 --> 06:28.822
for the Oak Island team.

06:28.856 --> 06:32.726
It could indicate the existence
of an underground cave,

06:32.760 --> 06:35.629
possibly one that is man-made.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.155
We've been in an open void
since, uh...

07:02.189 --> 07:06.860
we had a minor void,
uh, 166 to 169.

07:06.894 --> 07:10.631
And then we went
into a second void of 179

07:10.664 --> 07:14.668
-down to depth right now,
which is 215. -Wow.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.837
How high is that void?

07:16.870 --> 07:20.541
It's at least about 30 feet.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.510
NARRATOR:
A second void...

07:22.543 --> 07:24.645
some 30 feet tall

07:24.678 --> 07:28.916
and more than 180 feet
below ground?

07:28.949 --> 07:31.051
Could the Oak Island team

07:31.084 --> 07:33.787
really be dealing
with a natural formation,

07:33.821 --> 07:37.224
or something quite different?

07:37.257 --> 07:39.259
What is it?

07:39.292 --> 07:42.896
Could it be that spiral tunnel
the Restalls believed was there?

07:42.930 --> 07:44.498
Could we be hitting that?

07:44.532 --> 07:46.834
-What else can it be?
-I don't know.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.202
There's no other shaft
goes that deep.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.204
No searcher shaft
that we know of.

07:51.238 --> 07:54.274
Something's down there.

07:54.307 --> 07:59.012
In 1959, Robert Restall
and his wife Mildred,

07:59.046 --> 08:01.749
a couple who had gained
international notoriety

08:01.782 --> 08:03.917
as motorcycle daredevils,

08:03.951 --> 08:06.687
decided to move
with their two young sons

08:06.720 --> 08:10.023
to Oak Island, and there,
pursue Robert's dream

08:10.057 --> 08:13.026
of finding
an enormous treasure.

08:13.060 --> 08:16.997
I feel that the treasure is here
and that we can get it,

08:17.030 --> 08:20.000
and we're going to stay here
until we do.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.136
But the Oak Island of the 1950s

08:23.170 --> 08:25.973
was not the same one
seen today.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.742
It was desolate and primitive.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.844
There were no permanent
structures or homes

08:30.878 --> 08:32.212
on the island.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.047
There was no electricity.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.784
No running water.

08:36.817 --> 08:39.052
There was also no causeway

08:39.086 --> 08:41.955
connecting the island
to the mainland.

08:41.989 --> 08:45.192
All comings and goings
had to be by boat.

08:45.225 --> 08:48.829
The wife has had
a little rough... time here.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.164
Well, I don't think
it's been too rough, really.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.234
It's been hard
to adjust to at first.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.336
NARRATOR:
For six years,

08:56.369 --> 08:59.707
the Restalls braved
these harsh conditions,

08:59.740 --> 09:03.944
all the while doing extensive
investigations at Smith's Cove,

09:03.977 --> 09:05.813
in the swamp,

09:05.846 --> 09:08.181
and at the site
of the Money Pit,

09:08.215 --> 09:11.752
where, in 1963,
Robert Restall reported

09:11.785 --> 09:14.187
drilling through a series
of mysterious voids

09:14.221 --> 09:17.725
separated by layers of bedrock.

09:17.758 --> 09:21.061
This discovery led him
to the astonishing conclusion

09:21.094 --> 09:24.164
that he was not drilling
through a natural formation,

09:24.197 --> 09:27.100
but through a man-made,
spiral-shaped tunnel.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.804
They got into a part of it.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.305
They would drill, they'd go in,

09:32.339 --> 09:34.675
they'd go out of it,
in and out of it.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.977
That's why they believed
that there was a spiral one

09:37.010 --> 09:40.047
that led down
into an offset treasure chamber.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.617
That-that was their belief.

09:43.651 --> 09:47.120
Unfortunately, Robert Restall
would never live long enough

09:47.154 --> 09:50.791
to complete his investigation.

09:50.824 --> 09:54.928
On August 17, 1965,

09:54.962 --> 09:58.165
while exploring a flooded,
27-foot-deep searcher shaft

09:58.198 --> 10:00.834
at Smith's Cove,
Robert Restall,

10:00.868 --> 10:02.803
along with his son, Bobby Jr.,

10:02.836 --> 10:04.938
and two other men,

10:04.972 --> 10:09.910
died tragically after being
overcome by deadly H2S gas.

10:11.979 --> 10:16.116
The event sent shockwaves
throughout Nova Scotia

10:16.149 --> 10:19.887
and fueled rumors
of a deadly curse.

10:23.056 --> 10:26.860
Not surprisingly,
Robert Restall's wife, Mildred,

10:26.894 --> 10:29.129
and the couple's
youngest son, Richard,

10:29.162 --> 10:33.033
quickly left the island,
and rarely looked back.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.870
CHARLES:
A piece of wood right there.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.445
That's that cut again. Look.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.215
Got that same beveled cut.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.917
Do you think it's an ax?

10:49.950 --> 10:52.252
I mean, it kind of looks
like a low-angle ax.

10:52.285 --> 10:55.155
I mean, it's got
a nice cross-grain cut.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.190
NARRATOR:
Ax-cut wood?

10:57.224 --> 11:01.128
Found buried
nearly 200 feet underground?

11:11.271 --> 11:12.272
-Let's find this.
-Yeah.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.056
How's it going?

11:30.423 --> 11:32.960
-Whoa.
-Holy (bleep).

11:32.993 --> 11:37.497
RICK:
Somebody got hurt.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.900
NARRATOR: It is a tense
and harrowing moment

11:39.933 --> 11:41.935
at the Oak Island Money Pit

11:41.969 --> 11:45.806
as Rick Lagina and members
of the Brewster Drilling team

11:45.839 --> 11:47.941
rush to help
injured crewmember

11:47.975 --> 11:50.277
Max Williamson
after an explosion

11:50.310 --> 11:52.112
at the drill rig.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.214
-Okay, now, just stay
right there. -You okay?

11:54.247 --> 11:56.016
-Geez, (bleep). -Lay down.
-Ah, just stay right there.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.117
Just stay right there.

11:57.150 --> 12:00.087
(groans)
My leg might be (bleep).

12:00.120 --> 12:01.989
Calm down for a second.
We're gonna get you checked out.

12:02.022 --> 12:05.525
-Yeah, you're really...
-Oh, my (bleep).

12:05.558 --> 12:07.861
Just-just stay right here
for now.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.329
Don't put any weight on that.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.731
-Get 911 out here.
-That's what we're doing.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.003
-Oh! -Hold on, hold on.
-Can you bend it, or...?

12:16.036 --> 12:17.771
RICK:
Running over there,

12:17.805 --> 12:19.472
he's laying
in a prone position.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.241
(groans)

12:21.274 --> 12:23.410
His arm appears
to be at an awkward angle.

12:23.443 --> 12:26.513
His pants are ripped.

12:26.546 --> 12:29.783
Your first thought is, you know,
how badly is he injured?

12:29.817 --> 12:32.953
KYLE:
He's got a broken wrist.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.255
Bad contusion on his leg.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.190
(groans)

12:37.224 --> 12:40.027
TERRY:
Safety glasses saved your eyes.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.167
(exhales)

12:55.876 --> 12:57.811
(both laugh)

13:00.413 --> 13:03.183
That's not the positive way
to look at it.

13:05.352 --> 13:08.055
Man down.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.091
DAVE:
There it is now.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.996
CHARLES:
Oh, here it is. Yeah.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.098
NARRATOR:
Fortunately, it is not long

13:18.131 --> 13:20.133
before paramedics
arrive on site

13:20.167 --> 13:22.870
to determine the extent
of Max's injuries.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.045
Yeah?

13:38.018 --> 13:39.052
Yeah.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.626
Oh.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.161
You're good. Whoa.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.963
-You okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.598
NARRATOR:
Although it is their assessment

13:51.631 --> 13:53.901
that his life
is not under threat,

13:53.934 --> 13:56.203
the paramedics
will transport Max

13:56.236 --> 13:59.006
to a nearby hospital
for further examination

13:59.039 --> 14:01.074
and to monitor his condition.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.214
The extreme nature

14:07.247 --> 14:09.883
of both the incident
and Max's injuries

14:09.917 --> 14:12.519
has prompted Rick
to call his brother, Marty,

14:12.552 --> 14:14.387
who is away on business
in Michigan.

14:16.089 --> 14:19.026
Uh, we had an accident
here on site.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.929
Max got hurt.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.863
Hose blew out,
blew off the coupling.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.633
And, uh, hit him,

14:26.666 --> 14:28.235
knocked him backwards.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.170
He's got a large contusion
on his knee,

14:30.203 --> 14:32.940
but he's somewhat mobile,
I believe.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.909
But he may have
a fractured wrist, I think.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.444
-So we called the ambulance.
-All right.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.678
They came, got him.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.647
Uh, we're certainly shut down

14:40.680 --> 14:42.582
until we figure out
the mechanics

14:42.615 --> 14:44.151
of what-what happened.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.663
Right.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.105
Right.

15:05.138 --> 15:08.275
And that's why we need
to stay off the-the work area.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.610
When you're going around it,

15:10.643 --> 15:12.112
you walk around, not over them.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.513
I mean, I can't tell you
how many times

15:13.546 --> 15:15.648
all of us have stepped over
that same hose.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.121
Yep. Okay.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.322
Just wanted to let you know.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.458
All right. See you.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.462
RICK:
The seriousness of it

15:29.496 --> 15:31.364
and what it might have been

15:31.398 --> 15:35.002
has certainly made us
much more aware of the...

15:35.035 --> 15:38.338
of the safety issues
involving this-this process.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.473
It sobered us up, if you will.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.310
The real lesson
is how do we deal

15:43.343 --> 15:44.644
with that in the future?

15:44.677 --> 15:47.180
Have to deal with it,
absolutely.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.949
You know, maybe it was
an absolute worst-case scenario.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.387
When she blew, she blew.

15:54.421 --> 15:57.124
RICK: It was a violent,
violent scene.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.391
You know, he went over there,

15:58.425 --> 16:00.994
he probably bent down to-to...

16:01.028 --> 16:04.131
pull the hose away, and boom.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.299
Yeah, I can see a few changes

16:06.333 --> 16:09.102
I want to make...
make here for sure

16:09.136 --> 16:11.704
before we... before we
do anything else right now.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.373
'Cause we don't want this
to happen again.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.475
TERRY:
Absolutely.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.211
(wind whistling)

16:18.245 --> 16:19.546
That's how it...

16:19.579 --> 16:22.049
that's how it ended up,
right there.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.217
RICK:
We're now currently shut down,

16:24.251 --> 16:27.120
and then we have the issue
of making sure

16:27.154 --> 16:29.222
that this doesn't happen again.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.558
May take several hours.
May take several days.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.993
It doesn't matter.
It will get done.

16:38.565 --> 16:41.201
NARRATOR:
The next day, while Rick Lagina

16:41.234 --> 16:43.170
and the team
from Brewster Drilling

16:43.203 --> 16:45.805
work to determine
the cause of the accident...

16:45.838 --> 16:49.176
All right, let's just dig
some decent signals.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.111
...Jack Begley,

16:51.144 --> 16:53.713
along with Rick and Marty's
nephew Peter Fornetti

16:53.746 --> 16:56.449
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton,

16:56.483 --> 16:58.685
are continuing their search
of the area

16:58.718 --> 17:00.587
on the eastern tip
of Oak Island

17:00.620 --> 17:02.822
known as Isaac's Point.

17:02.855 --> 17:06.159
Still a bit dead.

17:06.193 --> 17:09.429
NARRATOR: It is the same area
where just one week ago

17:09.462 --> 17:13.333
the team found a curiously cut
17th century Spanish coin.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.202
(metal detector beeps)

17:15.235 --> 17:18.037
That's a little,
small piece of iron.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.707
If it was good iron,

17:20.740 --> 17:24.311
-it would be, you know,
a stronger signal. -Yep.

17:24.344 --> 17:27.280
Right. So, hopefully
this is a hot little area.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.826
(metal detector beeping)

17:39.859 --> 17:41.728
Oh, there's something.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.697
Unfortunately,
it's not very deep.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.168
(long, continuous beep)

17:55.608 --> 17:57.544
-Do you want me to see
if you got it out? -Yeah.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.146
-I didn't.
-(metal detector beeping)

17:59.179 --> 18:01.348
Okay. (chuckles)

18:09.156 --> 18:11.358
-What is it?
-It's the end of a gun.

18:22.902 --> 18:25.738
It's the end of a gun.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.707
But, like, a play gun.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.276
(chuckles)

18:29.309 --> 18:31.878
Yeah, you're right.
It's a toy gun.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.880
It's the end of a toy gun.
You're exactly right.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.282
Well, that's a first.

18:35.315 --> 18:38.218
All right, let me just check it.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.719
-(metal detector beeping)
-JACK: There's more?

18:39.752 --> 18:41.454
-Yeah.
-PETER: The rest of it.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.556
Could have the, uh, the handle.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.426
(metal detector beeping)

18:46.459 --> 18:48.395
-(laughs)
-It is.

18:48.428 --> 18:51.598
-We found a gun, lads.
-(all laugh)

18:51.631 --> 18:53.866
We found the handle of the gun,

18:53.900 --> 18:55.802
and I put the barrel up to it

18:55.835 --> 18:58.438
and went, "Hey, look,
here's the whole thing."

18:58.471 --> 19:01.541
-What make is it?
-Sure-Shot.

19:01.574 --> 19:04.511
NARRATOR: Coveted in the heyday
of TV westerns

19:04.544 --> 19:06.279
like Hopalong Cassidy,

19:06.313 --> 19:08.615
Roy Rogers and Wyatt Earp,

19:08.648 --> 19:12.385
Hubley Sure-Shot c guns
were hugely popular

19:12.419 --> 19:16.223
among kids growing up
in the 1950s and early 1960s.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.793
But as there were
virtually no children

19:20.827 --> 19:23.263
living on Oak Island
during this period,

19:23.296 --> 19:26.466
how did a toy gun manage
to find its way

19:26.499 --> 19:28.268
to this remote spot?

19:28.301 --> 19:29.969
JACK:
This should go in the museum.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.505
GARY: I wonder who lost it.
Some kiddie lost it.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.841
You can imagine
probably Dave or Dan

19:34.874 --> 19:37.277
running around
playing cowboys and Indians.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.246
-Probably.
-That goes in my good pocket.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.448
-I think it's... Yeah, I think
it's a good find. -(all laugh)

19:45.985 --> 19:49.456
NARRATOR: Across the island,
in the War Room,

19:49.489 --> 19:52.559
Rick Lagina and Charles
Barkhouse take advantage

19:52.592 --> 19:55.362
of the break in drilling
operations to revisit

19:55.395 --> 19:57.797
their Geotech grid strategy.

19:57.830 --> 20:00.833
There's a little bit
of good news here.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.403
I think we've got, certainly,
some stand-down time.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.004
I think we laid it out,

20:05.037 --> 20:06.839
but it was months ago
when we had laid that out.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.242
And now we have some more
information,

20:09.276 --> 20:12.379
we have a greater understanding
of the areas of interest.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.847
NARRATOR:
Although decades of exploratory

20:14.881 --> 20:16.683
drilling and excavation

20:16.716 --> 20:19.386
had given the team
a pretty good understanding

20:19.419 --> 20:22.622
of which searcher tunnels and
shafts exist belowground,

20:22.655 --> 20:25.892
only the Geotech method
can help them pinpoint

20:25.925 --> 20:29.596
their exact locations
and orientations.

20:29.629 --> 20:33.866
So far, the spoils retrieved
from the Geotech boreholes

20:33.900 --> 20:37.670
have suggested that a new
drilling strategy is in order,

20:37.704 --> 20:39.906
as well as an increase
in the total number of holes

20:39.939 --> 20:43.976
from 38 targets
to more than 40.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.978
Nevertheless,
there are limits,

20:46.012 --> 20:50.383
both in time and,
of course, money.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.853
Given the fact that based upon
some of the information

20:53.886 --> 20:58.358
from the one-third of the grid
we've currently completed,

20:58.391 --> 21:01.361
we have significant interest
in certain areas.

21:01.394 --> 21:04.397
We can't just keep expanding
the grid exponentially.

21:04.431 --> 21:07.934
As you can see, Hedden Shaft,
outlined here,

21:07.967 --> 21:10.036
Chappell Shaft outlined here,

21:10.069 --> 21:13.373
and we've got the 1897 drill
platform outlined here.

21:13.406 --> 21:16.976
And yet this area, we have
very few holes designated there.

21:17.009 --> 21:20.980
-Mm-hmm. -This area, I'd say,
from the G-line over...

21:21.013 --> 21:23.716
-Right.
-down to GAL right here,

21:23.750 --> 21:26.018
-Mm-hmm.
-and then over and across,

21:26.052 --> 21:29.756
probably within
that 20-foot grid...

21:29.789 --> 21:32.959
we have nothing.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.794
And I intend to see...

21:34.827 --> 21:37.630
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Jack. -Hey, Jack.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.399
-RICK: How you doing?
-Good, good.

21:39.432 --> 21:42.001
So, I was out on Isaac's Point
with Gary and Peter,

21:42.034 --> 21:45.438
and we found something, um...

21:45.472 --> 21:48.708
it's odd, but kind of cool.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.977
A toy pistol.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.615
RICK:
A toy gun.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.884
-That's... different.
-Gary believes

21:57.917 --> 22:01.821
it's from probably
the 1950s or '60s,

22:01.854 --> 22:04.791
somewhere in that range,
based upon the make of the gun.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.093
You can see
the brand name on there.

22:07.126 --> 22:09.562
You know, when you mention
the age, the period,

22:09.596 --> 22:11.631
I mean, uh...

22:11.664 --> 22:15.802
how can you not suspect that
this might be Ricky Restall's?

22:18.405 --> 22:21.708
NARRATOR: The youngest son of
treasure hunter Robert Restall,

22:21.741 --> 22:24.811
Richard Restall--
known at the time as Ricky--

22:24.844 --> 22:27.013
was only nine years old

22:27.046 --> 22:30.950
when his family moved
to Oak Island in 1959.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.919
Because he was too young

22:32.952 --> 22:35.888
to assist his father
and older brother, Bobby Jr.,

22:35.922 --> 22:39.091
in their search for treasure,
he spent much of his childhood

22:39.125 --> 22:41.027
with his mother, Mildred,

22:41.060 --> 22:45.498
helping with household chores
and playing by himself.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.567
My thought immediately was:

22:47.600 --> 22:50.603
I'll bet that had to do
with the Restalls.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.705
RICK:
The youngest Restall, Ricky,

22:52.739 --> 22:54.774
was a young boy at the time.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.676
I can imagine him
playing out in the fields,

22:56.709 --> 22:58.711
and he loses that pistol.

22:58.745 --> 23:01.013
"Sure-Shot," it says.
Right there.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.815
Mm-hmm.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.517
Got a little star on it.

23:04.551 --> 23:07.454
-It certainly would be amazing
if that was his. -Mm-hmm.

23:07.487 --> 23:10.490
It's remarkable. Little piece
of history sitting there.

23:10.523 --> 23:13.025
And you know how I feel
about the history of this place.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.562
-Yeah. -Me, too.
-And here's the other thing.

23:15.595 --> 23:18.765
I got a call from Lee Lamb
the other day.

23:18.798 --> 23:21.501
She has expressed interest
in coming back to the island

23:21.534 --> 23:23.803
to see the finished
Visitors' Center.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.772
Oh, wow.
Be nice to see her again.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.106
RICK:
Absolutely.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.208
NARRATOR:
During the nearly six years

23:29.241 --> 23:32.078
her parents and two brothers
spent living and working

23:32.111 --> 23:34.080
on Oak Island,

23:34.113 --> 23:37.684
Lee Lamb, the eldest of
the Restall's three children,

23:37.717 --> 23:41.721
was already married and raising
a family of her own.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.723
Although she was not present

23:43.756 --> 23:46.192
on the day
her father and brother died,

23:46.225 --> 23:49.962
her life has been
forever shaped by the tragedy.

23:49.996 --> 23:53.533
In 2012,
she wrote a book entitled

23:53.566 --> 23:57.637
Oak Island Family: The Restall
Hunt for Buried Treasure.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.506
Thank you.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.174
She has also made regular trips
to Oak Island

24:02.208 --> 24:04.243
to provide
important information

24:04.276 --> 24:06.879
about her father
and brother's progress,

24:06.913 --> 24:09.649
and to share
her father's stated belief

24:09.682 --> 24:12.852
that he was on the verge
of a major breakthrough

24:12.885 --> 24:15.955
just days before the accident
that claimed his life

24:15.988 --> 24:18.558
and that of her brother
and two coworkers.

24:18.591 --> 24:20.226
These are Bobby's journals.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.063
Lee is the custodian,
if you will,

24:24.096 --> 24:26.533
of all
of the Restall information

24:26.566 --> 24:28.968
garnered over the years--
the maps, the photographs,

24:29.001 --> 24:31.671
all of the information
that they gathered.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.172
Maybe she'll remember
whether or not

24:33.205 --> 24:34.941
-Ricky had that.
-Exactly. Absolutely.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.509
-Thanks, Jack.
-Great find, man.

24:36.543 --> 24:37.610
-Yeah, really.
-Great find.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.985
NARRATOR: Two days
after the sudden explosion

24:46.018 --> 24:48.821
at the Geotech drill site,

24:48.855 --> 24:52.224
Rick and Marty Lagina, along
with their friend and partner

24:52.258 --> 24:55.161
Craig Tester,
are heading to the Money Pit

24:55.194 --> 24:58.565
to meet with the team
from Brewster Drilling.

24:58.598 --> 24:59.832
MARTY:
Well, it just underscores...

24:59.866 --> 25:01.133
I mean, really,
it brings to mind

25:01.167 --> 25:03.269
that Oak Island
is a dangerous place.

25:03.302 --> 25:06.839
I mean, what we're doing
involves heavy equipment,

25:06.873 --> 25:09.742
high pressures, cavities,
unknowns...

25:09.776 --> 25:11.711
It's inherently dangerous.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.179
NARRATOR:
They are eager to learn

25:13.212 --> 25:15.615
what caused
the near-fatal accident...

25:15.648 --> 25:17.817
Whoa!

25:17.850 --> 25:19.552
...and to find out
about the condition

25:19.586 --> 25:21.554
of driller Max Williamson.

25:21.588 --> 25:23.656
(groans)

25:23.690 --> 25:27.193
Marty and I were gone when the
accident happened at the rig.

25:27.226 --> 25:28.460
So we're eager
to get out there,

25:28.494 --> 25:32.632
find out how Max is doing
and then what went wrong

25:32.665 --> 25:36.603
and lastly, what do we do
to correct that problem?

25:36.636 --> 25:37.937
MARTY:
We need to kind of take

25:37.970 --> 25:39.939
a deep breath and say,
"What does this teach us

25:39.972 --> 25:41.874
about how we go forward," right?

25:41.908 --> 25:44.243
-Absolutely.
-All right, well,

25:44.276 --> 25:46.012
I hope Max is fine.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.014
We'll find out right now.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.949
I've been involved
in a lot of heavy industries

25:49.982 --> 25:51.784
my whole career.

25:51.818 --> 25:55.321
There's always the chance, when
you got people and materials

25:55.354 --> 25:57.023
and heavy equipment,
for an injury.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.825
So all these things
are going through my mind

25:58.858 --> 25:59.959
when I come out here
to the island.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.227
Not thinking
about anything else, really.

26:01.260 --> 26:02.862
Not thinking about treasure,

26:02.895 --> 26:04.797
not thinking about progress
on these holes.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.166
Just thinking about getting
this safety issue behind us.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.101
Nice to see you, Kyle.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.737
-I want to know about Max first.
-Yeah.

26:10.770 --> 26:13.339
How's he doing?

26:13.372 --> 26:17.176
Well, they discharged him from
hospital 9:00 Friday night.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.812
Radiologist called back
the next day,

26:19.846 --> 26:20.847
said that there was
actually a small fracture

26:20.880 --> 26:22.381
in his right wrist.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.885
But none of the things that you
worry about, neck, head...

26:25.918 --> 26:27.920
-No.
-What about his knee?

26:27.954 --> 26:29.789
I mean, that was a huge
contusion on the knee.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.924
KYLE: Yeah, he's
a little tender there.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.392
Swelling came down on that,
though.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.895
You know, when something goes
wrong, it goes wrong badly.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.329
-(laughs) So....
-And quickly.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.265
-And quickly.
-Exactly.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.067
You know, it's Oak Island, too.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.969
I mean, we-we were talking
about that on the way over here.

26:43.002 --> 26:45.071
You know, what we're doing
here is, it's dangerous stuff.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.739
Yeah.

26:46.773 --> 26:49.942
So I'm relieved that no one
was killed.

26:49.976 --> 26:52.411
No one was hurt
in a permanent sense.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.815
I think there are things we can
do to prevent it in the future.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.750
A whole bunch of things
occurred at once

26:57.784 --> 27:00.019
to cause that line to fail.

27:00.052 --> 27:03.656
And if it fails, it's going
to fail pretty dramatically.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.926
NARRATOR: As each borehole
is drilled, high-pressure air

27:06.959 --> 27:09.762
circulates what is known
as mixing mud:

27:09.796 --> 27:14.133
a combination of water
and mud-making dry chemicals.

27:14.166 --> 27:17.003
This stabilizes the pressure
in the drill rig

27:17.036 --> 27:20.039
to force the cuttings,
or spoils it produces,

27:20.072 --> 27:24.310
up to the surface where it is
separated out by hand.

27:24.343 --> 27:29.849
However, if debris from these
spoils, such as wood or clay,

27:29.882 --> 27:33.119
build up in the rig's
high-pressure hose,

27:33.152 --> 27:37.323
it can explode
with bone-crushing force.

27:37.356 --> 27:40.092
KYLE:
This plugged, that plugged.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.393
It's a combination of things
that really led

27:41.427 --> 27:42.929
to failing one
of the hoses, so...

27:42.962 --> 27:45.064
Right.

27:45.097 --> 27:46.298
RICK: When the hose separated
from the coupling,

27:46.332 --> 27:48.735
that allowed this
to snake off the hose.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.102
Yeah, this is a,
this is a safety, right?

27:50.136 --> 27:51.470
-Yeah.
-The coupling, the coupling.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.039
This is designed...
if the coupling releases,

27:53.072 --> 27:54.741
this-this holds
the two couplings together?

27:54.774 --> 27:56.108
-Right.
-Yeah, exactly.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.044
But even without the coupling,
it should choke it.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.112
Yeah, that-that should,
that should, you know,

28:00.146 --> 28:02.048
if there's enough energy
in that hose and it lets go,

28:02.081 --> 28:04.316
that should, that should snug up
against the hose.

28:04.350 --> 28:07.186
And I mean in this, in this
scenario, it didn't.

28:07.219 --> 28:08.988
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.990
MARTY: So, what are you going
to do different?

28:11.023 --> 28:12.224
KYLE: Yeah, we're gonna,
we're gonna change over

28:12.258 --> 28:14.193
to a different style
of-of restraint.

28:14.226 --> 28:16.228
So that'll be a-a whip sock.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.230
-So that-that's going
to act more like a... -Yeah.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.099
Yeah, 'cause like you put that
there and just pull on that.

28:20.132 --> 28:21.500
-Like a finger trap. -MARTY:
Just get, just gets tighter.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.135
Just tighter and tighter.

28:23.169 --> 28:26.072
You can't... the hose,
the hose has nowhere to go.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.074
NARRATOR:
By using a stronger cable

28:28.107 --> 28:30.409
to secure the connection
between hoses,

28:30.442 --> 28:33.079
the Brewster Drilling team
will be able

28:33.112 --> 28:35.948
to safely resume
Geotech operations.

28:35.982 --> 28:38.184
In the funny way
the world works, then,

28:38.217 --> 28:41.320
-we can count our blessings
on this. -Yeah.

28:41.353 --> 28:43.956
And I'm really glad Max is, you
know, sounds like he'll be fine.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.224
Yeah.

28:45.257 --> 28:48.494
I think we move forward
more intelligently.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.930
Our main priority and the
biggest part of our discussion

28:50.963 --> 28:53.365
was about safety,
but once we got that behind us,

28:53.399 --> 28:56.368
and new protocols in place,
and the paperwork filled out,

28:56.402 --> 28:58.304
it's time to go to work.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.239
So, how long
to make your changes,

29:00.272 --> 29:02.241
Kyle, you know, to get this
to where you're happy with it

29:02.274 --> 29:04.043
and we get back to drilling?

29:04.076 --> 29:05.477
What are we looking at?

29:05.511 --> 29:07.079
-I think a week, I would say.
-Oh, great.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.514
KYLE: We'll be ready
to hit the ground running.

29:08.547 --> 29:10.016
It's just... want to make sure
everything is in place

29:10.049 --> 29:11.483
before we get started.

29:11.517 --> 29:12.919
Okay, good. That was good.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.054
-Thanks, guys.
-All right.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.156
NARRATOR: As the drilling team
outfits their rig

29:17.189 --> 29:21.160
with the new safety equipment,
Rick and Marty Lagina,

29:21.193 --> 29:23.963
along with members
of the Oak Island team,

29:23.996 --> 29:26.365
have gathered
to greet Lee Lamb,

29:26.398 --> 29:29.301
the oldest child of legendary
Oak Island treasure hunters

29:29.335 --> 29:31.303
Robert and Mildred Restall.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.205
-Charles!
-Gentlemen.

29:33.239 --> 29:35.507
NARRATOR:
But Lee is not alone.

29:35.541 --> 29:37.409
Today, she has
brought with her

29:37.443 --> 29:41.180
someone who has not been to the
island in more than 20 years...

29:41.213 --> 29:42.214
MARTY:
Hello, Lee. Hello.

29:42.248 --> 29:43.983
Hi, how are you?

29:44.016 --> 29:46.052
NARRATOR: ...someone
Rick and Marty Lagina

29:46.085 --> 29:47.319
have been eager to meet.

29:47.353 --> 29:49.021
I brought you a present.

29:49.055 --> 29:50.389
Wow.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.058
This is my brother,
Rick Restall.

29:52.091 --> 29:53.425
CRAIG:
Oh. (laughs)

29:59.631 --> 30:03.269
NARRATOR: This is a huge moment
in the history of Oak Island,

30:03.302 --> 30:06.072
as brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina

30:06.105 --> 30:07.874
and members of their team

30:07.907 --> 30:10.242
meet face-to-face
with Richard Restall,

30:10.276 --> 30:12.478
one of the only
living witnesses

30:12.511 --> 30:15.948
to that fateful day in 1965

30:15.982 --> 30:19.585
that saw the tragic deaths
of both his father and brother

30:19.618 --> 30:23.622
and two of the men
who tried to rescue them.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.357
I'm Marty Lagina.
Nice to meet you.

30:25.391 --> 30:26.592
Yes, sir. Rick's brother?

30:26.625 --> 30:28.627
I've, uh, seen you
in some of the pictures.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.897
MARTY: It was real interesting
to meet Ricky,

30:30.930 --> 30:33.232
that's what we know him as,
Ricky Restall,

30:33.265 --> 30:35.868
because in our minds' eye,
he's an, he's an eight-year old,

30:35.902 --> 30:37.937
running around this island.

30:37.970 --> 30:40.139
That's how we know him
from the literature.

30:40.172 --> 30:43.342
So here comes a guy who's
actually a contemporary of ours.

30:43.375 --> 30:46.979
And he is the real
Rick Restall, grown up.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.514
Hi, Lee.

30:48.547 --> 30:49.515
Hi, how are you?

30:49.548 --> 30:51.517
Good. Nice to see you again.

30:51.550 --> 30:54.954
NARRATOR: Although in recent
years Lee Lamb has become

30:54.987 --> 30:57.489
a relatively regular visitor
to the island,

30:57.523 --> 31:01.627
Richard Restall has returned
to Oak Island only once before,

31:01.660 --> 31:03.963
during a memorial ceremony held

31:03.996 --> 31:07.033
on the 30th anniversary
of the tragedy.

31:07.066 --> 31:10.402
It's amazing
to have Ricky with me.

31:10.436 --> 31:15.241
After the accident, he wouldn't
talk about Oak Island,

31:15.274 --> 31:20.612
and so I respected that
and didn't press him for it.

31:20.646 --> 31:24.416
And it's just nice
that he's got to the point

31:24.450 --> 31:25.584
where he's ready to do this,

31:25.617 --> 31:28.220
ready to be here.

31:28.254 --> 31:32.391
I thought it might be time
to deal with, uh,

31:32.424 --> 31:36.195
what-what came up when
my father and my brother died,

31:36.228 --> 31:38.430
and we left the island.

31:38.464 --> 31:42.101
Uh, it was kind of a sudden
and unplanned departure,

31:42.134 --> 31:45.938
so in some ways, uh,
I've never left the island.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.709
Well, welcome back.

31:50.742 --> 31:53.679
-Thank you.
-Yeah, you're welcome.

31:53.712 --> 31:56.315
So, what we'd like to show you
is the museum.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.217
Great. Wonderful.
I was hoping.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.419
RICK:
We've got what we think is

32:00.452 --> 32:03.689
a wonderful display
of the 222 years of search, and

32:03.722 --> 32:06.525
you know, the Restall era,
of course, we have paid

32:06.558 --> 32:09.128
significant
and particular attention to.

32:09.161 --> 32:12.164
And, uh, we're trying
to pay respect to the people

32:12.198 --> 32:13.665
that have come before us.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.567
The Restall family played

32:15.601 --> 32:18.537
a very prominent role
in the history of the search.

32:18.570 --> 32:21.207
And to welcome Lee
and her brother Ricky back...

32:21.240 --> 32:23.475
They have
an intimate connection here.

32:23.509 --> 32:26.645
-Why don't we go in and take a
look? -Let's have a look. -Yeah.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.514
RICK:
No one suffered more.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.416
-Uh...
-Sacrificed more.

32:30.449 --> 32:34.753
Yeah, had put more of themselves
into this search.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.622
Plus, whenever they come back,
we usually learn something.

32:36.655 --> 32:38.190
Mm-hmm.

32:38.224 --> 32:40.492
LEE:
Thank you.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.263
Wow.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.265
-Here you go.
-Some place.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.300
Great.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.169
NARRATOR:
Built by the Laginas

32:50.202 --> 32:52.538
and their partners
two years ago,

32:52.571 --> 32:54.740
The Oak Island
Interpretation Center

32:54.773 --> 32:57.376
houses an ever-expanding
collection of artifacts

32:57.409 --> 33:00.412
and evidence of treasure

33:00.446 --> 33:02.148
discovered
by the Oak Island team

33:02.181 --> 33:03.749
and their predecessors

33:03.782 --> 33:06.618
throughout the centuries-long
treasure hunt.

33:06.652 --> 33:10.489
It is a place where thousands
of visitors each year

33:10.522 --> 33:14.693
can experience firsthand
the 222-year-old mystery

33:14.726 --> 33:18.097
and the history
it has inspired.

33:18.130 --> 33:20.666
RICK:
So, Lee and Rick,

33:20.699 --> 33:23.435
there's one more area
in the museum that

33:23.469 --> 33:26.238
we have singularly dedicated
to telling the Restall story,

33:26.272 --> 33:27.606
-and that's right over here.
-Mm.

33:27.639 --> 33:28.707
MARTY:
Let's go have a look.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.242
LEE:
Great.

33:32.544 --> 33:33.779
MARTY: This whole corner,
as you'll see,

33:33.812 --> 33:35.747
-is the Restall corner.
-Yeah.

33:35.781 --> 33:38.350
MARTY: It's a key part
of the museum, and your family's

33:38.384 --> 33:40.519
-a key part
of the history. -Right.

33:42.721 --> 33:46.058
LEE:
That's Bobby.

33:46.092 --> 33:49.295
And there's a picture
of your mother holding

33:49.328 --> 33:51.063
the 1704 stone, Lee.

33:51.097 --> 33:52.731
LEE:
Yes, definitely. Well, and

33:52.764 --> 33:55.267
-Ricky found it, so...
-Oh, you found that stone?

33:55.301 --> 33:57.803
I was with my mother
when, uh... when the stone

33:57.836 --> 34:01.107
-turned up in a pile
of washings. -MARTY: Oh, okay.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.774
NARRATOR:
Although rarely involved

34:02.808 --> 34:05.677
in his family's
treasure-hunting activities,

34:05.711 --> 34:09.115
Richard Restall is credited,
along with his mother,

34:09.148 --> 34:12.684
with making one of his family's
most significant discoveries--

34:12.718 --> 34:16.288
a rounded stone found
at Smith's Cove,

34:16.322 --> 34:18.724
on which the numbers
one, seven,

34:18.757 --> 34:21.327
zero and four are carved,

34:21.360 --> 34:25.497
indicating either a date,
or possibly a code.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.668
This is Ricky

34:29.701 --> 34:32.538
in your red shirt
and your bug gear.

34:34.773 --> 34:37.443
-And that's Mom.
-RICKY: Yeah. Yeah.

34:37.476 --> 34:40.346
You really picked
the right things, all of it.

34:40.379 --> 34:42.714
That's fantastic.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.484
I just want to say
that I'm really pleased that

34:45.517 --> 34:48.587
-my brother's original maps
are on the walls here. -Yeah.

34:48.620 --> 34:51.223
They'll be preserved here.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.625
This will always be a part
of the Oak Island story, so...

34:53.659 --> 34:55.294
LEE:
I'm amazed.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.729
Fantastic job
you've done, really.

34:57.763 --> 35:01.867
When we got to look around
in the museum,

35:01.900 --> 35:05.804
and Rick pointed out
the Restall corner, I was just

35:05.837 --> 35:08.740
thrilled to death that
my brother had hard evidence

35:08.774 --> 35:11.710
in front of his eyes
of the respect that's being paid

35:11.743 --> 35:16.315
to the Restall,
uh, work on the island.

35:16.348 --> 35:20.219
Here's another little treasure
that we found.

35:20.252 --> 35:23.689
We found this out
on Isaac's Point.

35:23.722 --> 35:29.661
And the thought was, because you
were a young lad at the time,

35:29.695 --> 35:33.465
everyone said, "Well, you know,
this might be Ricky's."

35:36.435 --> 35:38.270
Might that mean anything to you?

35:46.212 --> 35:49.881
-Wow.
-Yeah.

35:49.915 --> 35:52.251
RICK: We found this out
on Isaac's Point.

35:56.222 --> 35:58.490
Wow.

36:03.929 --> 36:06.398
(sniffles)

36:06.432 --> 36:09.868
Hmm.

36:16.742 --> 36:19.645
It looks, uh...

36:19.678 --> 36:21.280
Yup.

36:21.313 --> 36:23.749
My friend.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.217
(laughs)

36:25.251 --> 36:26.985
My gosh, this...

36:27.018 --> 36:29.321
This must be my gun.

36:29.355 --> 36:31.357
I know I lost it, and...

36:31.390 --> 36:35.594
Well, looks like it's here again

36:35.627 --> 36:38.230
after 50-odd years.

36:38.264 --> 36:39.665
NARRATOR: While joining
his sister, Lee Lamb,

36:39.698 --> 36:41.700
on what has been a rare

36:41.733 --> 36:45.637
and momentous visit
to Oak Island, Richard Restall,

36:45.671 --> 36:48.407
the youngest son of famed
Oak Island treasure hunters

36:48.440 --> 36:50.242
Robert and Mildred Restall,

36:50.276 --> 36:52.978
has just been presented
with an artifact

36:53.011 --> 36:54.813
of great personal significance.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.882
MARTY:
It's got to be a neat thing

36:56.915 --> 36:59.751
that the last time you handled
that you were, what, ten?

36:59.785 --> 37:02.954
-At the most, ten.
-Yeah, yeah.

37:02.988 --> 37:05.891
And how much smaller my hands
must have been then.

37:05.924 --> 37:08.994
-(laughter) -RICK: To me
it was interesting when

37:09.027 --> 37:11.530
we showed Ricky
the-the... the cap gun.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.533
I think in that moment,
certainly,

37:14.566 --> 37:16.302
it brought him back
to his youth,

37:16.335 --> 37:19.271
and my hope in that moment
was that it--

37:19.305 --> 37:20.639
they were good memories.

37:20.672 --> 37:22.708
That that moment would be

37:22.741 --> 37:24.443
a bit transformative,
if you will, for him.

37:24.476 --> 37:25.777
That he could,

37:25.811 --> 37:28.947
perhaps, let go of the past.

37:28.980 --> 37:32.351
I remember arriving on the
island with all the stuff

37:32.384 --> 37:33.919
that a city kid would have.

37:33.952 --> 37:35.687
-Like a cowboy outfit...
-There you go.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.823
...the hat, the holster,
the gun.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.791
And by the end of that summer,

37:39.825 --> 37:41.393
I think most of that stuff

37:41.427 --> 37:44.896
was somewhere else
on the island.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.499
(laughter)

37:47.533 --> 37:50.669
Actually seeing a gun
from that era was a reminder

37:50.702 --> 37:53.405
of what a carefree childhood
would be.

37:53.439 --> 37:55.607
And it was a reminder
of my time...

37:55.641 --> 37:57.676
My first summer on the island,
in other words,

37:57.709 --> 38:00.779
was fun and childish games,

38:00.812 --> 38:02.848
and mostly imagination.

38:02.881 --> 38:05.884
It was like a paradise
in those days.

38:05.917 --> 38:08.954
That's neat.

38:08.987 --> 38:13.559
This trip was momentous for me

38:13.592 --> 38:18.497
because it draws my brother
into his rightful place.

38:20.566 --> 38:23.969
He's got a deep connection
with the island.

38:24.002 --> 38:28.073
This was Ricky's moment.

38:29.708 --> 38:30.742
Okay, well, listen,
we thank you

38:30.776 --> 38:32.544
for your part of the story,

38:32.578 --> 38:34.513
we thank you for cooperating
with us, we thank you

38:34.546 --> 38:35.914
for all the information
you've given us,

38:35.947 --> 38:37.749
and we thank you today
for this visit.

38:37.783 --> 38:39.418
And it was just an absolute
pleasure meeting you, sir.

38:39.451 --> 38:42.554
And, of course, this young lady,
always a pleasure.

38:42.588 --> 38:43.822
Thank you very much.

38:51.129 --> 38:55.066
NARRATOR: One week following
Lee Lamb and Richard Restall's

38:55.100 --> 38:57.503
emotional return
to Oak Island,

38:57.536 --> 39:00.506
Marty, Rick and the team

39:00.539 --> 39:02.941
resume their Geo-Tech
drilling operation

39:02.974 --> 39:04.643
at the Money Pit site.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.378
You guys ready to make hole?

39:06.412 --> 39:08.013
Ready to find the treasure.

39:08.046 --> 39:09.515
I like that.

39:09.548 --> 39:11.617
-I think we're ready.
-Drill.

39:19.758 --> 39:22.961
NARRATOR:
Today also marks the return

39:22.994 --> 39:25.864
of driller Max Williamson,

39:25.897 --> 39:28.066
who has spent the past several
days recovering

39:28.099 --> 39:29.835
from the worst of his injuries.

39:29.868 --> 39:34.072
Yeah, I think that'll do.
That'll do.

39:34.105 --> 39:35.941
So far, the score is
Money Pit 16,

39:35.974 --> 39:39.878
us... us?

39:39.911 --> 39:41.447
-I'm giving us one...
-Zero!

39:41.480 --> 39:43.682
-Zero.
-I'm giving us one.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.685
NARRATOR: For Rick, Marty
and their partners,

39:46.718 --> 39:49.555
the events of the past
two weeks have served

39:49.588 --> 39:50.889
as a potent reminder

39:50.922 --> 39:53.892
of just how dangerous
and deadly

39:53.925 --> 39:56.662
the search for answers can be.

39:56.695 --> 39:59.831
It also reminds them
that the bond they share

39:59.865 --> 40:01.066
is a powerful one.

40:01.099 --> 40:03.635
Not only with each other,

40:03.669 --> 40:06.472
but with the hundreds
of Oak Island treasure hunters

40:06.505 --> 40:08.206
who have come before them,

40:08.239 --> 40:10.909
and whose lives have been
irrevocably changed

40:10.942 --> 40:12.878
by the search.

40:12.911 --> 40:16.114
Although the story of Robert
and Mildred Restall

40:16.147 --> 40:18.617
is only one
in a growing number

40:18.650 --> 40:20.652
involving Oak Island's
families,

40:20.686 --> 40:24.723
the hardships they endured,
both physical and emotional,

40:24.756 --> 40:28.627
have ensured them a special
place in the minds and hearts

40:28.660 --> 40:32.664
of all who seek to join
on their incredible quest--

40:32.698 --> 40:36.768
the quest to solve
a 222-year-old mystery

40:36.802 --> 40:40.071
that has, so far,
claimed six lives.

40:40.105 --> 40:44.242
And one whose legend insists
will claim one more

40:44.275 --> 40:47.178
before all will be revealed.

40:51.983 --> 40:54.920
NARRATOR: Next time
on The Curse of Oak Island...

40:54.953 --> 40:57.222
They believed the Money Pit
was over here.

40:57.255 --> 40:59.625
What we haven't got is what
direction they were drilling.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.827
-We have to do more research.
-This is quite a document.

41:01.860 --> 41:04.129
-Have you seen that before?
-No, I haven't.

41:04.162 --> 41:06.698
Wow. I didn't expect there to be
"X" marks the spot.

41:06.732 --> 41:09.034
He's in some sort of void,
but he hit something.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.702
Hopefully, it's what
we're looking for.

41:10.736 --> 41:12.738
-Okay, that's interesting.
-Wow.

41:12.771 --> 41:14.540
We're getting pottery
at 190 feet.

41:14.573 --> 41:17.809
We have one more piece.
What is that?

41:17.843 --> 41:19.611
My immediate reaction is
it's bone.
