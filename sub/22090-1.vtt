03:39.085 --> 03:40.752
Are you Kelly?

03:40.754 --> 03:41.987
Yes.

03:41.989 --> 03:42.989
Come in.

03:50.596 --> 03:51.863
Thanks for coming.

03:51.865 --> 03:54.800
That's my ah, my grandson, Evan.

03:55.635 --> 04:01.039
Well, the sightings have been
happening in his bedroom.

04:04.510 --> 04:05.844
Okay.

04:30.002 --> 04:33.071
Here, let me get you some light.

04:45.685 --> 04:46.918
There you go.

05:09.876 --> 05:12.644
Evan, do you always
see the ghosts at night?

05:12.646 --> 05:14.579
Evan, Evan!

05:14.581 --> 05:16.648
Evan, come on back, come on.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.749
Come on.

05:17.751 --> 05:21.019
You know, he hasn't been the
same since his mother died.

05:21.021 --> 05:24.122
He, ah started having
these sightings.

05:25.725 --> 05:28.527
Our family has lived
in this house for,

05:28.529 --> 05:30.796
oh, 150 years or more.

05:31.431 --> 05:35.100
My great great
grandparents built it.

05:35.102 --> 05:39.137
I never heard any talk
about any ghosts or nothing.

05:40.706 --> 05:41.573
Do you mind?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.208
No, no, go ahead.

06:20.246 --> 06:21.680
Bingo.

06:29.922 --> 06:31.756
Is there an airport near here?

06:31.758 --> 06:35.927
Ah, no, not nearby, no,
couple of hundred miles,

06:35.929 --> 06:36.995
where you came in.

06:36.997 --> 06:40.899
Anything smaller, like
a helicopter landing pad?

06:40.901 --> 06:43.535
Ah, no, not that I know of.

06:45.104 --> 06:47.205
And this is mostly
farmland, right?

06:47.207 --> 06:48.207
Yeah.

06:48.774 --> 06:50.775
What do your neighbors farm?

06:50.777 --> 06:54.012
Wheat, few other
grains, mostly wheat.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.082
Have your neighbors
recently started dusting

06:57.084 --> 07:00.085
their crops at night
instead of during the day?

07:00.087 --> 07:03.955
Yes, they have but
what's that got to do with?

07:12.298 --> 07:15.200
There is no such
thing as ghosts.

08:16.862 --> 08:17.862
Breakfast?

08:18.364 --> 08:19.664
Oh hey.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.066
I'll eat in a little bit.

09:24.096 --> 09:25.096
Babe.

09:25.965 --> 09:27.232
I have to go.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.067
It's a lead on a story.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.235
What?

09:30.670 --> 09:31.403
Where?

09:31.405 --> 09:34.973
Toronto, I
have to go to Toronto.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.374
Well when will you be home?

09:37.443 --> 09:39.844
I'll be back in time
for the party tonight,

09:39.846 --> 09:40.846
I promise.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.448
Jesus, Kel, take
a day off already.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.684
Soon, I'll do that soon.

09:56.962 --> 09:58.730
Lower bay station, please.

09:59.732 --> 09:59.731
Don't you mean upper bay?

09:59.733 --> 09:59.731
There's no lower bay
anymore, you know?

09:59.733 --> 10:04.703
I know, I just need you to
get me to the station entrance,

10:04.705 --> 10:05.804
that's the closest.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.205
Okay.

10:25.991 --> 10:27.058
Hi mom.

10:27.060 --> 10:31.129
So, how are
you doing today, honey?

10:32.398 --> 10:34.065
I'm fine.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.934
Are you sure?

10:35.936 --> 10:40.105
No, I've been fine
on this day every year

10:40.107 --> 10:42.774
for the past 30 years, really.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.008
I'm okay.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.076
Okay.

10:45.778 --> 10:47.011
Is that it, 'cause I really,

10:47.013 --> 10:48.179
I need to go.

10:49.915 --> 10:50.982
Sure. Um,

10:51.951 --> 10:53.351
if you need me.

10:53.853 --> 10:55.153
Yeah, I know.

11:01.794 --> 11:02.794
Bye.

11:15.808 --> 11:17.909
So what brings you to Canada?

11:17.911 --> 11:21.813
I'm doing a story on the
abandoned subway station.

11:21.815 --> 11:22.881
Really?

11:24.016 --> 11:25.083
What about it?

11:25.085 --> 11:27.986
Well, the fact that
people say it's haunted.

11:27.988 --> 11:31.956
Yeah, that's why
they call it the ghost station.

11:31.958 --> 11:34.058
Have you been down there?

11:35.427 --> 11:36.494
Actually yeah,

11:36.496 --> 11:38.229
but it was a long time ago.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.431
Just a few years after that
lady was killed down there

11:40.433 --> 11:42.100
on the tracks, right.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.868
It was like 1969.

11:44.136 --> 11:46.805
Do you know anything
about that woman?

11:46.807 --> 11:46.805
The one who died.

11:46.807 --> 11:51.910
You know, some people said
she was at Lakeshore asylum,

11:51.912 --> 11:53.444
which connects two
of the stations

11:53.446 --> 11:56.147
through these
underground tunnels.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.016
But I don't know any of
the facts, like I say,

11:58.018 --> 11:59.417
I just know what I heard.

12:00.352 --> 12:01.352
Anything else?

12:01.554 --> 12:03.822
Some say she was pregnant.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.858
She had twins, one was
stillborn and the father,

12:06.860 --> 12:08.092
he never came to visit.

12:08.094 --> 12:10.862
I think one day
she just snapped.

12:12.498 --> 12:15.433
Something happen when
you went down there?

12:15.435 --> 12:18.136
My friends and I snuck in and.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.138
And?

14:36.075 --> 14:37.642
What are you doing down here?

14:40.179 --> 14:42.113
I could ask you the same thing.

15:05.738 --> 15:09.040
Do you ever feel
anything down here?

15:09.042 --> 15:10.408
Like what?

15:12.411 --> 15:15.580
Like a vibration or
a pain in your ears?

15:17.383 --> 15:19.550
Do you ever see anything?

15:21.487 --> 15:22.620
Like a ghost?

15:30.129 --> 15:31.462
Like the lady in red?

15:31.464 --> 15:32.397
Who?

15:32.399 --> 15:34.032
That's what they call her,

15:34.666 --> 15:36.267
the lady that jumped.

15:37.302 --> 15:40.071
She was covered in blood
when they found her.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.073
Oh.

15:42.141 --> 15:44.275
But we never go that far

15:44.277 --> 15:47.111
down to, where she died.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.613
Where is it?

15:50.682 --> 15:52.617
We have to go that way.

15:54.686 --> 15:56.421
But it's pretty far.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.190
Are you going?

16:00.292 --> 16:02.360
Yeah, I'll see you later.

16:06.398 --> 16:08.332
Not if she sees you first.

16:11.537 --> 16:14.072
Didn't your parents tell you?

16:14.074 --> 16:16.474
There's no such
things as ghosts.

23:40.719 --> 23:41.719
Hello?

23:42.521 --> 23:43.921
Is someone here?

23:57.702 --> 23:58.702
Come on.

24:19.090 --> 24:20.090
Come on.

24:42.948 --> 24:44.615
Uh, hello?

24:44.617 --> 24:46.350
You the lady that
reported the dead body?

24:47.118 --> 24:48.152
Yes.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.597
What's your name, miss?

25:00.932 --> 25:02.299
Kelly Johansen.

25:14.779 --> 25:15.779
Address?

25:16.815 --> 25:17.881
Traveling.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.154
Okay, why don't you
just lead the way?

25:24.156 --> 25:26.256
Got a call about a body?

25:26.258 --> 25:27.925
I was just about
to check it out.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.026
Yeah.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.001
Detective Richards.

25:37.003 --> 25:39.269
This who called it in?

25:39.271 --> 25:40.337
Yeah.

25:40.339 --> 25:43.807
Well I'll take it from here.

25:43.809 --> 25:45.009
You can go.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.276
All yours.

25:46.278 --> 25:47.278
Let's go.

25:52.851 --> 25:53.917
After you.

26:07.699 --> 26:11.035
So what exactly has you
hanging around down here?

26:11.037 --> 26:12.436
Didn't you see the signs?

26:13.705 --> 26:13.704
Yeah, I saw the signs.

26:13.706 --> 26:17.041
You're just not
big on following the rules.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.175
Look, I'm just

26:18.177 --> 26:20.077
down here backpacking.

26:21.179 --> 26:22.179
This is it.

26:36.227 --> 26:37.928
He was here.

26:38.797 --> 26:40.931
Are you sure you
got the right place?

26:40.933 --> 26:42.766
I'm sure I know

26:42.768 --> 26:43.934
what I saw.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.170
Well we're seeing otherwise.

26:52.143 --> 26:54.445
Why don't you tell me again
why you're really down here?

26:57.982 --> 27:00.384
Okay fine, you're not
buying the backpacking thing.

27:01.319 --> 27:02.920
For one thing you
don't have a backpack,

27:02.922 --> 27:03.987
you have a duffle.

27:04.989 --> 27:06.890
Which looks pretty big and bulky

27:06.892 --> 27:07.958
with a creepy doll inside.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.261
Wanna tell me what else
you got inside there?

27:11.263 --> 27:12.730
Does it matter?

27:12.732 --> 27:15.132
There was a dead body
there now there's not.

27:18.002 --> 27:20.137
Fine, I study sound waves.

27:22.006 --> 27:24.141
Paranormal activity,
that's what I do.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.442
I write books, I blog.

27:25.444 --> 27:27.211
Alright, now we're
getting somewhere.

27:31.282 --> 27:33.050
Well, if you're the expert,

27:34.185 --> 27:35.786
how do you think the
body disappeared?

27:44.096 --> 27:45.529
All right, you buy
yourself one night down here

27:45.531 --> 27:47.297
to prove or disprove
whatever you like.

27:47.299 --> 27:49.433
Or what, you're gonna
throw the book at me?

27:49.435 --> 27:51.034
Yeah, something like that.

27:52.270 --> 27:52.269
Be careful down here.

27:52.271 --> 27:55.539
Those danger signs are
up there for a reason.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.187
Oh!

34:23.460 --> 34:27.664
Well, I didn't
mean to scare you.

34:28.366 --> 34:28.364
It's okay.

34:28.367 --> 34:32.902
I didn't know anyone
was down here.

34:33.771 --> 34:39.309
Oh, I just set down
here every once in a while

34:39.311 --> 34:40.744
to change bulbs.

34:44.815 --> 34:48.451
They all usually burn
out at the same time.

34:52.956 --> 34:59.396
Seems like a waste, since nobody's
supposed to be down here.

35:01.432 --> 35:06.670
But I just do as I'm told.

35:11.976 --> 35:14.744
I'm Clinton Jones.

35:17.215 --> 35:18.481
Kelly Johansen.

35:25.957 --> 35:31.661
I better get on to the next one.

35:31.929 --> 35:36.333
Have you ever seen
anything down here?

35:39.804 --> 35:41.871
What kind of anything?

35:49.814 --> 35:52.349
What are you doing down here?

35:56.687 --> 35:59.356
Trying to catch
yourself a ghost?

36:01.892 --> 36:03.727
Something like that.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Come on.

36:12.270 --> 36:14.304
Let me show you something.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.596
This is where the cemetery ends.

36:41.399 --> 36:43.500
This is a graveyard?

36:43.502 --> 36:44.502
Oh.

36:46.370 --> 36:47.771
I thought you knew.

36:50.408 --> 36:52.909
Lots of people
come down here now.

36:54.545 --> 36:55.979
Looking for ghosts.

36:58.849 --> 37:04.020
Since news came out
that the station

37:04.022 --> 37:06.423
was built on Potter's field.

37:07.858 --> 37:10.627
Potter's field was a graveyard?

37:12.596 --> 37:15.999
No, it was a cemetery
for the faithless.

37:17.902 --> 37:18.902
The poor.

37:20.538 --> 37:21.805
And friendless.

37:24.742 --> 37:27.777
So they just
built right over it?

37:31.549 --> 37:32.949
Something like that.

37:33.918 --> 37:39.489
Some people call it the
stranger's graveyard.

37:40.758 --> 37:45.795
Cemetery officially
closed in 1855.

37:47.765 --> 37:50.934
The next of kin was
given the option

37:50.936 --> 37:57.907
of either claiming the
body or having it moved.

37:58.642 --> 38:00.810
So the bodies were moved?

38:02.480 --> 38:07.517
Those that were
claimed were moved.

38:07.519 --> 38:10.420
And the strangers
were left behind?

38:11.555 --> 38:12.789
That's the rumor.

38:13.958 --> 38:19.162
About 5,000 or so unclaimed.

38:25.403 --> 38:27.971
What exactly brought
you down here?

38:31.609 --> 38:32.609
Honestly?

38:37.481 --> 38:40.417
I thought I knew, but
now I'm not so sure.

38:41.585 --> 38:43.653
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

38:46.457 --> 38:49.859
I better get on.

38:53.197 --> 38:56.166
Maybe I'll see you again.

38:58.035 --> 38:59.035
Okay.

39:11.615 --> 39:12.615
Kel?

39:15.152 --> 39:16.152
Kelly?

40:09.006 --> 40:10.006
Help me.

41:57.014 --> 42:01.217
Will you help me?

42:01.219 --> 42:03.119
Help me.

42:33.952 --> 42:35.251
If you know who this is,

42:35.253 --> 42:37.086
then you know what to do.

42:37.088 --> 42:39.155
Damnit, Kell, come on.

42:43.260 --> 42:44.827
You're not real.

43:05.883 --> 43:08.117
Help me.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.952
- Help me.
- Emily?

43:18.195 --> 43:20.129
Help me.

43:20.131 --> 43:21.131
Help me.

43:22.900 --> 43:23.900
No.

44:35.072 --> 44:36.072
What?

44:49.521 --> 44:51.053
How can I help you?

44:51.055 --> 44:53.122
Yes, I'd like a flight
from Detroit to Toronto.

46:23.447 --> 46:24.647
Miss Johansen?

46:27.484 --> 46:28.551
Miss Johansen?

46:29.353 --> 46:31.420
Are you still down here?

46:48.505 --> 46:49.572
Miss Johansen?

46:55.112 --> 46:56.112
It's me.

46:56.980 --> 46:58.180
Detective Richards.

46:58.182 --> 47:00.583
We met earlier.

47:15.032 --> 47:16.299
So what happened?

47:19.236 --> 47:20.336
I don't know.

47:23.173 --> 47:24.407
I saw a woman.

47:27.945 --> 47:29.512
What'd she look like?

47:34.351 --> 47:42.351
Just an image, like
smoke with no eyes.

47:47.431 --> 47:49.632
Did you see anything else?

47:55.672 --> 47:57.340
No, nothing else.

48:06.450 --> 48:08.050
What about your research?

48:09.052 --> 48:10.252
What'd you find?

48:14.725 --> 48:17.426
Something I've
never seen before.

48:30.340 --> 48:33.409
It's below any infrasonic
sound I've ever recorded.

48:35.445 --> 48:37.046
What does that mean?

48:37.114 --> 48:40.583
It's a type of sound,
sound that's below

48:40.585 --> 48:45.121
the threshold of human
hearing, can't really be heard,

48:45.123 --> 48:46.689
but it can be felt.

48:48.191 --> 48:49.592
There are researchers,
people like me,

48:49.594 --> 48:53.629
believe that this
type of tactile sound

48:53.631 --> 48:55.731
is what causes ghost
sightings, which are really

48:55.733 --> 48:59.468
just hallucinations.

49:01.238 --> 49:03.305
How would that be?

49:03.307 --> 49:05.608
Well, the sound
causes vibrations.

49:05.610 --> 49:09.311
Vibrations that cause
subtle eye movement,

49:09.313 --> 49:11.247
movement in the
matter around you.

49:12.215 --> 49:14.750
If this type of sound
is strong enough,

49:14.752 --> 49:17.486
it can bend metal,
it could crush a car.

49:18.588 --> 49:20.823
Here's a different
school of thought.

49:20.825 --> 49:24.160
People that think the sound
is caused by the spirits.

49:24.162 --> 49:26.695
That the frequency opens
up some sort of portal

49:26.697 --> 49:28.531
to the other side,
which is, of course,

49:28.533 --> 49:30.433
completely ridiculous.

49:34.071 --> 49:36.138
So you don't believe
that ghosts are real?

49:38.508 --> 49:41.277
I've spent my entire
career proving they're not.

49:45.482 --> 49:47.716
Why would this place
have that kind of sound?

49:48.618 --> 49:50.319
This station, because it's under

49:50.321 --> 49:53.789
other functioning stations
serves as a sort of vessel

49:53.791 --> 49:55.357
for this tactile sound.

49:55.359 --> 49:56.826
So how would you
prove that these waves

49:56.828 --> 49:59.128
of what these people
are seeing down here?

49:59.130 --> 50:00.696
I've been looking over
the map of the tunnels

50:00.698 --> 50:04.166
and there's an area,
it's at the farthest end

50:04.168 --> 50:06.869
of the station, I think the
waves, I think they should be

50:06.871 --> 50:09.138
the strongest there.

50:09.140 --> 50:12.408
The location of that room's where
all three tunnels converge.

50:12.410 --> 50:15.811
I think they'll be so
potent we may be able

50:15.813 --> 50:18.114
to record the hallucinations.

50:20.117 --> 50:21.750
I'm game if you are.

52:01.351 --> 52:05.688
Hey, I let you sleep for awhile.

52:06.456 --> 52:08.390
Thought you could use it.

52:09.226 --> 52:10.226
Yeah.

52:11.294 --> 52:12.861
You sure you're up for this?

52:14.397 --> 52:15.664
Yes I'm sure.

52:18.835 --> 52:19.835
You sure?

52:20.503 --> 52:22.271
You could be home in a warm bed.

52:22.273 --> 52:25.507
No, I'm an insomniac.

52:30.847 --> 52:32.748
- Let's do this.
- Alright.

52:42.525 --> 52:43.993
So what are we looking for here?

52:43.995 --> 52:46.262
Zep, here.

52:46.529 --> 52:48.631
It's at the end of the station.

52:48.633 --> 52:49.698
That room there.

52:49.700 --> 52:53.302
Alright, I see it.

52:54.304 --> 52:56.538
And then what?

52:56.540 --> 53:01.577
Then we hope to
record infrasonic waves

53:01.579 --> 53:05.481
to prove to the paranormally
curious, once again,

53:05.483 --> 53:09.752
that there is no
such thing as ghosts

53:09.754 --> 53:12.554
and that this thing they
call the ghost station

53:12.556 --> 53:15.457
is really just a
rat infested pit

53:15.459 --> 53:17.926
with some interesting graffiti.

53:19.729 --> 53:22.498
Then I suppose people won't
come down here no more, right?

53:23.733 --> 53:26.835
Sure, unless I
can't prove it's fake.

53:29.572 --> 53:31.640
But that's not a
possibility, is it?

53:34.577 --> 53:35.911
So what are you?

53:35.913 --> 53:37.479
A believer or non?

53:40.083 --> 53:41.850
I really haven't
given it much thought.

53:47.590 --> 53:48.824
So annoying.

53:48.826 --> 53:51.827
I get perfect Internet
from the upper bay,

53:51.829 --> 53:54.596
but down here, my
phone signal drops out.

54:06.943 --> 54:08.544
What are you doing?

54:08.611 --> 54:11.780
I'm documenting my activity.

54:11.782 --> 54:16.085
I like to put pictures
with my stories.

54:16.087 --> 54:18.354
And what does graffiti
have to do with your story?

54:21.391 --> 54:23.559
This isn't just any graffiti.

54:23.561 --> 54:27.563
This is the infamous
lady in red.

54:27.565 --> 54:28.964
And how do you know that?

54:30.033 --> 54:34.636
I saw some photos online.

54:35.805 --> 54:36.872
Some photos?

54:37.073 --> 54:40.109
No, there's no photos.

54:43.079 --> 54:45.781
And how would you
know that, detective?

54:47.484 --> 54:50.052
I thought you weren't
interested in ghost stories.

54:59.896 --> 55:01.497
What happened?

55:01.698 --> 55:03.098
That just looks
like a light fell.

55:05.168 --> 55:08.771
Oh, old fingers.

55:17.180 --> 55:19.448
The light's still
out in the back.

55:20.417 --> 55:22.418
Oh, I'm working on it.

55:25.922 --> 55:28.857
I'm sure there's
no rush to fix them.

55:28.859 --> 55:30.926
Since no one's supposed
to be down here.

55:33.630 --> 55:34.930
I'll get on it.

55:54.717 --> 55:55.984
Come on, let's go.

56:07.864 --> 56:09.798
Take me to the
lower bay station.

56:20.577 --> 56:22.144
Guess you don't need the map.

56:26.115 --> 56:27.115
Who are you?

56:31.856 --> 56:33.255
It doesn't matter who I am.

56:34.090 --> 56:35.023
All right?

56:35.025 --> 56:38.760
The only thing that
matters is that you and me

56:38.762 --> 56:40.162
want the same thing.

56:41.865 --> 56:42.865
Ok?

56:43.600 --> 56:44.666
What do you want?

56:45.802 --> 56:48.837
And why did you lie to me?

56:48.839 --> 56:50.572
Why did you act like
you didn't know anything

56:50.574 --> 56:50.572
about this place?

56:50.574 --> 56:53.842
Look, there's only one
thing I'm interested in.

56:55.211 --> 56:56.778
And that one thing

56:58.681 --> 57:00.148
is for you to prove

57:00.150 --> 57:02.951
that there's no
ghosts down here.

57:04.053 --> 57:05.053
Simple.

57:06.723 --> 57:08.090
What if I can't?

57:09.158 --> 57:10.759
And why couldn't you?

57:11.661 --> 57:14.062
I mean, that is what you do,

57:15.164 --> 57:16.164
is it not?

57:19.736 --> 57:21.570
Unless you changed your mind and

57:21.572 --> 57:23.272
you believe in ghosts.

57:25.241 --> 57:26.241
Do you?

57:29.245 --> 57:30.245
No.

57:30.747 --> 57:31.813
I don't believe in ghosts.

57:32.916 --> 57:33.916
Ok.

57:35.585 --> 57:37.119
Then you can do this.

57:38.955 --> 57:41.924
- Why do you care so much?
- It's none of your business.

57:41.926 --> 57:43.292
I just need you
to prove this, Ok?

57:43.294 --> 57:45.093
And I don't need any
pictures of that graffiti

57:45.095 --> 57:46.995
or videos leaking out.

57:53.603 --> 57:54.670
Oh my god.

57:57.974 --> 57:59.141
You're the one.

58:01.611 --> 58:03.178
It was you.

58:03.180 --> 58:05.147
That sent me the
photos, you that

58:05.149 --> 58:07.149
contacted me, it was
you that messaged me.

58:07.151 --> 58:08.684
How do you even know?

58:12.322 --> 58:14.590
It wasn't that hard to find out.

58:17.260 --> 58:18.260
Now.

58:18.795 --> 58:20.028
I understand.

58:22.098 --> 58:24.166
It must have been scary
for an eight year old.

58:25.835 --> 58:28.070
I mean, they never did
close that case, did they?

58:30.306 --> 58:34.009
And that is why you ended up
in the institution.

58:40.149 --> 58:44.686
Look, just follow the plan,

58:44.688 --> 58:46.088
and you'll walk away from this.

58:47.857 --> 58:50.859
Why are you doing this?

58:50.861 --> 58:52.194
You know why I'm doing this,

58:52.196 --> 58:54.196
I want you to do what
you came here to do.

58:54.198 --> 58:55.198
Debunk.

58:56.265 --> 58:57.966
You tell all those
people that it's those

58:57.968 --> 59:00.669
sound waves and all that
crap that you write about.

59:00.671 --> 59:01.671
Move.

59:04.674 --> 59:05.674
Come on.

59:27.363 --> 59:29.331
I don't want to hurt you.

59:30.967 --> 59:31.967
But I will.

59:33.836 --> 59:36.772
So just stick with the
plan, and we'll both

59:36.774 --> 59:38.106
walk away from here.

59:39.709 --> 59:40.709
Ok?

59:42.245 --> 59:43.245
Get up.

59:47.216 --> 59:48.216
Move.

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:36.932
What?

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:38.867
This is it.

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:42.170
How do you know?

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:46.174
I can feel it.

01:00:52.448 --> 01:00:53.515
So what now?

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:56.051
You read the sound, right?

01:00:58.254 --> 01:01:02.424
Right, well, fortunately,
one of us has to stay out

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:06.261
here to measure waves while
the other goes inside.

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:17.005
What's going on?

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.509
I don't know, there must
be some kind of accident.

01:01:28.951 --> 01:01:30.018
You ready?

01:01:32.822 --> 01:01:34.189
Yeah, I'm ready.

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:17.299
Detective, get out of there.

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:18.867
Huh?

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:21.203
Detective.

01:02:21.205 --> 01:02:22.604
Come on, let me go.

01:02:23.372 --> 01:02:24.372
Please.

01:02:24.374 --> 01:02:26.541
Come on.
Detective, detective.

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:28.877
Detective, get out of there.

01:02:28.879 --> 01:02:30.312
Get out of there.

01:02:54.136 --> 01:02:55.303
Help me.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.441
Jesus, Kel, I've
been worried sick.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:49.778
There's something
going on down here.

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.246
I need help.

01:05:51.248 --> 01:05:54.482
All right, all right.

01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:56.551
Just try and stay calm, Ok?

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.620
Can you get out?

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:01.256
I don't know.

01:06:03.092 --> 01:06:04.492
I need you.

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:07.062
I'm coming for you,
Ok, just hang on.

01:06:07.064 --> 01:06:10.432
I want you to focus on
finding a way out, Ok?

01:06:14.437 --> 01:06:15.437
Kel?

01:06:15.738 --> 01:06:16.738
Kel?

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:19.808
Damn.

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:25.847
Which way do I go?

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:27.382
On foot, are you crazy?

01:06:27.384 --> 01:06:28.616
You're like four miles out.

01:06:28.618 --> 01:06:30.285
Just humor me.

01:06:30.287 --> 01:06:31.286
See those buildings?

01:06:31.288 --> 01:06:32.520
Head for them.

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:36.918
Claudette Irving.

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:47.462
Ophelia Larue.

01:08:05.814 --> 01:08:07.415
Colin Jones.

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:26.868
They're not real.

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:06.608
- 911 emergency.
- My fiance is

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:08.943
in the lower bay train station.

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:11.613
- I think she's stuck.
- Is she locked in, sir?

01:09:11.615 --> 01:09:13.648
- I don't know.
- Is your fiance's name

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.416
Kelly Johansson?

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.618
- Yes, yes, it is.
- Apparently she called in

01:09:17.621 --> 01:09:19.654
a false lead earlier.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:21.956
Sir, need I remind you
that misleading an officer

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:25.326
of the law is a crime?
What?

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:26.661
- Hello...
- Fuck.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.662
- Sir, are you there?
- Fuck.

01:09:52.654 --> 01:09:53.688
Who's there?

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:11.572
Are you afraid, Kelly?

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:23.051
You don't need to be.

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:29.424
We are here to help each other.

01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:49.504
Mythology moths
represent a spirit not

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:52.874
at rest, a lost soul.

01:12:25.707 --> 01:12:26.774
Kelly!

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:33.114
Kel!

01:13:19.127 --> 01:13:20.127
Kelly!

01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:32.300
Kelly!

01:15:09.271 --> 01:15:10.638
Oh, thank god.

01:15:12.275 --> 01:15:13.708
Are you okay?

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:16.644
I'm supposed to help her.

01:15:16.646 --> 01:15:19.313
I'm supposed to help them all.

01:15:19.315 --> 01:15:22.216
I think that's why
I was brought here.

01:15:22.218 --> 01:15:23.951
Help who?

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:24.986
The spirits.

01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:28.389
Kell, honey, you're
not thinking straight.

01:15:29.324 --> 01:15:30.791
Just wait 'til I
get there, okay?

01:15:30.793 --> 01:15:32.293
I'm close.

01:15:32.295 --> 01:15:34.028
I'm inside the tunnels.

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:36.330
It has to be done.

01:15:36.332 --> 01:15:38.199
I'm running out of time.

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:44.739
Is it somehow
connected to Emily?

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:48.809
Kell?

01:15:48.811 --> 01:15:50.845
Yeah, I'm here.

01:15:50.847 --> 01:15:51.679
I don't know.

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:52.313
Maybe.

01:15:52.315 --> 01:15:53.347
I think so.

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:56.917
I didn't realize what day it is.

01:15:57.819 --> 01:15:58.819
I'm sorry.

01:16:01.156 --> 01:16:03.224
Do you think I'm imagining this?

01:16:04.693 --> 01:16:05.860
I'll be there soon.

01:16:05.862 --> 01:16:07.895
Just wait 'til I get there.

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:10.765
Just tell me how to find you.

01:16:10.767 --> 01:16:12.767
There's an exit sign.

01:16:14.302 --> 01:16:15.369
It's lit up.

01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:20.107
I saw it when I came down here.

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:22.710
Find that door.

01:16:22.712 --> 01:16:23.712
Okay.

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:26.213
I'll meet you there.

01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:15.896
Somebody there?

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:54.168
Emily?

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:57.338
Is that you?

01:18:01.543 --> 01:18:02.543
Cam?

01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:09.243
Ethan, she's down here.

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:10.911
Who's down there?

01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:12.546
Emily.

01:19:12.548 --> 01:19:14.481
I have to do it now.

01:19:14.483 --> 01:19:15.583
Kell, please.

01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:18.252
No, look, there's a room.

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:20.955
She led me there.

01:19:22.324 --> 01:19:23.924
She led you there how?

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.027
I followed her.

01:19:27.029 --> 01:19:29.396
Kell, please.

01:19:29.398 --> 01:19:32.299
No, look, I need
you to believe me.

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:34.935
Okay.

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:36.937
Okay.

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:39.106
As long as it's not dangerous.

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:41.976
I'll be there soon
and I'll find you.

01:19:41.978 --> 01:19:44.044
The sound is the
strongest in there.

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.214
Kell, no.

01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:50.651
Damn.

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:54.455
Kelly?

01:20:19.515 --> 01:20:20.515
Ah!

01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:52.740
Take thee to the place
where the highest

01:21:52.742 --> 01:21:56.276
has appointed thee
and take your leave.

01:21:56.278 --> 01:21:58.145
Take thee to the place
where the highest

01:21:58.147 --> 01:22:01.315
has appointed thee
and take your leave.

01:22:13.661 --> 01:22:16.063
Oh, now, take thee to the
place where the highest

01:22:16.065 --> 01:22:18.132
has appointed thee.

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:28.609
Kelly?

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:38.752
Kelly?

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:45.479
I got you.

01:24:45.481 --> 01:24:46.580
I have to go.

01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:47.881
I have to save Emily.

01:24:49.218 --> 01:24:50.717
No, no, no.

01:24:50.719 --> 01:24:52.719
Kell, stop, it's over.

01:24:52.721 --> 01:24:55.222
It's not over, she's
gonna die in there.

01:24:55.224 --> 01:24:56.757
Oh, Jewel, please.

01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:58.759
Emily's gone.

01:25:01.396 --> 01:25:03.297
Don't make me do this.

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:08.268
Listen to me.

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:12.406
Emily didn't die.

01:25:23.918 --> 01:25:25.519
There was no Emily.

01:25:51.312 --> 01:25:52.279
Kelly?

01:25:52.281 --> 01:25:52.913
Kelly?

01:25:52.915 --> 01:25:54.014
Kelly!

01:25:54.016 --> 01:25:55.482
Oh, no!

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:56.484
Oh, my god!

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:10.397
She saved me.

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:13.667
Yes, she did.

01:26:15.503 --> 01:26:16.737
She saved you.

01:26:54.342 --> 01:26:55.342
Hey.

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:37.551
The reality
is that there are ghosts.

01:27:37.553 --> 01:27:39.619
They are all around us.

01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:41.755
Some are there to help guide us.

01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:44.558
They help us get
to the other side.

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:47.761
And we help them get there, too.

01:27:47.763 --> 01:27:51.598
Their sound makes us see
whatever we need to see.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.967
What is inside our minds.

01:27:53.969 --> 01:27:58.105
Sometimes life's too much,
so we go into something else.

01:27:58.107 --> 01:27:59.639
Somewhere else.

01:27:59.641 --> 01:28:02.709
But that other
place is very real,

01:28:02.711 --> 01:28:04.778
and there are others
there with us,

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:06.646
helping us to let go.

01:28:07.715 --> 01:28:10.517
Signing off for the last time,

01:28:10.519 --> 01:28:11.818
Kelly Johansen.

01:28:16.091 --> 01:28:17.157
So, now what?

01:28:20.094 --> 01:28:21.862
So, now I look for a new job.

01:28:23.097 --> 01:28:25.165
Hang on, I gotta
think about this.

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:30.570
I didn't sign on to
marry an unemployed girl.

01:28:30.572 --> 01:28:32.939
So, now you want me to work?

01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:39.146
Well, what would Kelly
Johansen do without her work?

01:28:39.148 --> 01:28:41.081
Sad, but true.
