WEBVTT

00:07.013 --> 00:08.770
<i>Previously, on "Damnation"...</i>

00:08.817 --> 00:11.025
Turns out, this is what the Duvalls do.

00:11.050 --> 00:13.540
<i>They hire muscle to clear
whatever land they want.</i>

00:13.565 --> 00:15.890
We'd like the Black Legion
to stop this farmer's strike.

00:16.110 --> 00:18.205
<i>Why was our Pinkerton
shooting at your men?</i>

00:18.299 --> 00:20.808
Because that Pinkerton and
the preacher are in cahoots.

00:20.875 --> 00:22.732
Amelia told me about her first husband.

00:22.757 --> 00:24.243
I certainly hope
you were able to mete out

00:24.277 --> 00:26.240
some retribution on that strikebreaker.

00:26.301 --> 00:27.710
I never got the chance.

00:27.735 --> 00:28.876
You mean you didn't kill him?

00:28.960 --> 00:31.086
The Black Legion...
They taking over this town.

00:31.111 --> 00:33.694
Looks like we just caught
ourselves a couple of agitators.

00:33.910 --> 00:35.590
<i>We best get prepared
to defend ourselves.</i>

00:43.121 --> 00:44.181
DL...

00:44.508 --> 00:45.523
What's it say?

00:45.548 --> 00:46.708
They've got Amelia.

00:46.732 --> 00:50.067
If I don't hand myself over,
they say she's next.

01:13.779 --> 01:16.046
Oh, dear child.

01:18.217 --> 01:20.366
Let's get you back inside.

02:16.788 --> 02:19.055
If you've come to take my son,

02:19.311 --> 02:21.255
you'll have to get through me to do it.

02:21.306 --> 02:23.406
I'm not here for young Sam, Martha.

02:23.588 --> 02:26.022
It may be hard to believe,

02:26.184 --> 02:28.251
but I'm here to serve this county.

02:29.975 --> 02:33.587
Now, tell me
what the hell happened here?

02:33.859 --> 02:37.106
Well... there were at least
a hundred of them.

02:37.235 --> 02:39.369
- Mm-hmm.
- We seen torches

02:39.418 --> 02:41.318
coming over that ridge.
Over that ridge.

02:44.557 --> 02:46.023
Hey.

02:46.084 --> 02:47.142
Hey.

02:47.212 --> 02:48.612
How'd you sleep last night?

02:51.066 --> 02:52.632
Like a log, you?

02:52.694 --> 02:54.457
Oh, you know,

02:55.290 --> 02:57.057
likewise.

02:59.174 --> 03:01.658
I had the strangest dreams though.

03:08.215 --> 03:10.657
Does that chapel look familiar to you?

03:11.626 --> 03:13.862
It's Colton Creek.

03:14.636 --> 03:16.286
I don't think this is the
first time you've been involved

03:16.311 --> 03:18.378
in the Duvall family's dirty work.

03:30.513 --> 03:32.946
Hey, hey, what're you
gonna hand yourself over now?

03:32.982 --> 03:35.349
I'm not gonna let
the past repeat itself.

03:35.384 --> 03:38.519
Okay, well, maybe
it ain't up to you, hm?

03:38.554 --> 03:39.786
Go on, tell him.

03:40.169 --> 03:42.870
The name Paideuma Oil
sound familiar to you?

03:42.944 --> 03:45.511
That's the company
that hired our family to...

03:46.001 --> 03:47.200
clear land for them.

03:47.237 --> 03:49.326
If you dig deep enough,
you'll find Paideuma Oil's

03:49.351 --> 03:51.584
owned by the Duvall family.

03:51.781 --> 03:52.847
See?

03:52.922 --> 03:54.482
The bastards who're behind
Melvin Stubbs

03:54.577 --> 03:56.455
and the Black Legion are
the same people who paid Pa

03:56.480 --> 03:57.886
to clear all that land.

03:58.054 --> 04:00.755
Kill Cynthia, Preacher Rainey.

04:02.105 --> 04:04.584
Everything we've been through, Seth,

04:05.393 --> 04:06.821
it's 'cause of them.

04:06.856 --> 04:08.756
And now they've got Amelia.

04:08.859 --> 04:12.328
I can't risk losing her.
I'm handing myself over.

04:13.396 --> 04:14.912
And then what?

04:15.064 --> 04:16.869
I'm gonna stall,

04:18.108 --> 04:20.575
and hope somebody
figures something out.

04:36.386 --> 04:38.486
- Stop! Hands up.
- Hold it right there.

04:42.405 --> 04:44.371
I'm unarmed.

04:56.672 --> 04:59.667
Stock's gone. So's the market.

04:59.854 --> 05:02.989
I don't even know if we
even have any livestock left.

05:03.318 --> 05:04.857
For all we know,
they're still controlling

05:04.893 --> 05:06.113
the roads and the blockades.

05:06.173 --> 05:09.262
Yeah, well, I'm going back into town

05:09.523 --> 05:11.764
and try to find out
where they took the preacher

05:11.800 --> 05:12.999
and stashed his missus.

05:13.235 --> 05:14.915
We're going with you.

05:15.009 --> 05:18.477
Preston won't make it
unless we get him to a doctor.

05:37.692 --> 05:39.625
Good afternoon.

05:39.661 --> 05:42.944
We have someone in
urgent need of medical care.

05:43.038 --> 05:44.479
As we presume no doctors

05:44.504 --> 05:46.064
would be willing to travel these roads,

05:46.089 --> 05:47.939
we're taking him into town ourselves.

05:48.404 --> 05:51.446
I would now like to appeal
to your common decency,

05:51.700 --> 05:53.639
and petition you to let us through.

05:59.755 --> 06:02.122
All y'all boys are armed, huh?

06:02.294 --> 06:04.291
Damn right we are.

06:04.523 --> 06:06.035
Show 'em.

06:14.936 --> 06:18.638
Ma'am, I believe you just
shot three men without a miss.

06:18.887 --> 06:20.540
It appears you shot

06:20.575 --> 06:22.693
three out of four targets.

06:22.944 --> 06:24.569
A laudable percentage.

06:24.594 --> 06:26.480
So tell me, Sheriff,
are you gonna be arresting us

06:26.505 --> 06:28.004
for firing on these here fellas?

06:28.283 --> 06:29.753
No,

06:29.778 --> 06:32.079
I imagine once these fellas
aimed their weapons,

06:32.104 --> 06:35.806
it was a clear-cut case
of self-defense.

06:36.024 --> 06:38.311
Off with your costumes!

06:38.860 --> 06:40.794
Each of you is a clear accomplice

06:40.819 --> 06:43.962
to your hooded brethren's
attempted deadly assault.

06:44.132 --> 06:45.492
But as some of you may have heard,

06:45.516 --> 06:47.934
I'm capable of the
occasional compromise.

06:48.047 --> 06:50.493
So, if all of you get
your worthless asses

06:50.518 --> 06:52.051
out of this county,

06:52.174 --> 06:54.607
we won't shoot you down like dogs!

06:54.643 --> 06:56.142
Unless you return.

06:56.402 --> 06:57.827
Now, git!

06:57.852 --> 07:00.019
Go! Go! Come on, get moving!

07:02.432 --> 07:06.119
It should now be a clear path
into town for you ladies.

07:06.355 --> 07:08.341
Thank you very much, Sheriff.

07:10.352 --> 07:12.752
Well, my distinct pleasure.

07:26.367 --> 07:28.954
I reckon you got the
cuddly feelings, Sheriff.

07:29.001 --> 07:30.774
Oh, I haven't felt this warm inside

07:30.799 --> 07:33.285
since I saw you do your
little jingle-jangle dance

07:33.305 --> 07:34.938
in that warehouse.

07:36.855 --> 07:39.076
Drive me to town.

07:55.594 --> 07:58.420
For an unredeemable racist,

07:58.645 --> 08:02.902
I have to admit Melvin has
solid political instincts.

08:03.869 --> 08:05.668
If Melvin wins,

08:05.932 --> 08:08.862
he'll get his hands on young Sam again.

08:09.469 --> 08:12.136
Well, you are
the one that arrested him.

08:12.348 --> 08:13.754
Yeah.

08:13.852 --> 08:15.919
Evidence suggests either

08:16.275 --> 08:18.173
Sam pulled the trigger
that killed Pete,

08:18.198 --> 08:21.003
or someone did a fancy job
of framing him.

08:24.617 --> 08:26.088
Time of day'd you say that, uh,

08:26.113 --> 08:27.827
poor Pete Collingsworth was killed?

08:28.080 --> 08:29.346
Morning.

08:29.382 --> 08:31.689
Oh, well, see, I was tracking
the little Riley shit

08:31.724 --> 08:33.490
the entire morning.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.743
Oh yeah, he was all the way across town

08:35.768 --> 08:37.467
rousing up commies.

08:38.664 --> 08:40.630
So, Sam Jr. was nowhere near

08:40.686 --> 08:42.932
the Collingsworth farm that day?

08:44.683 --> 08:45.973
No.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.975
It appears I've arrested the wrong man.

08:56.015 --> 08:58.016
Where you off to, cowboy?

08:58.530 --> 09:00.602
I'm gonna go talk to this,
uh, new banker.

09:00.696 --> 09:01.886
Why?

09:01.921 --> 09:03.628
Well, he's on Duvall's payroll.

09:03.653 --> 09:05.383
He might be the only one
who could talk down

09:05.408 --> 09:08.634
Melvin Stubbs and his attack goons.

09:53.382 --> 09:55.364
Ma thought you might like
some clean clothes

09:55.389 --> 09:57.595
and a home-cooked meal.

09:58.935 --> 10:00.336
It's gonna take more than fresh laundry

10:00.361 --> 10:03.596
and a casserole to get you
back in my good graces.

10:07.300 --> 10:09.000
So, should I turn over my badge?

10:09.035 --> 10:10.398
Not yet.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.511
I need all the men I can get.

10:13.567 --> 10:15.934
In fact...

10:18.678 --> 10:22.313
I need you to deputize every farmer,

10:22.349 --> 10:25.408
moonshiner, fornicator,
and degenerate gambler

10:25.433 --> 10:29.535
who's willing to help us take
down these Legion bastards.

10:29.856 --> 10:31.503
Sure thing, Uncle Sheriff Don.

10:31.624 --> 10:34.425
Starting at the Riley farm.

10:37.163 --> 10:39.163
That banker gonna call off Melvin?

10:39.280 --> 10:40.598
That banker's dead,

10:40.881 --> 10:43.857
so we're gonna have
to figure something else out.

10:44.704 --> 10:46.838
I think I have an idea
where Melvin might be.

10:47.329 --> 10:50.074
<i>Till the polls close and the
fate of your county is sealed.</i>

10:50.110 --> 10:52.599
<i>So, it's high time you
fulfilled your patriotic duty</i>

10:52.624 --> 10:54.557
<i>and cast your vote.</i>

10:54.915 --> 10:56.787
<i>As sheriff of Holden County,</i>

10:56.927 --> 11:00.639
<i>I'll hold every lawbreaker
accountable for his crimes.</i>

11:01.053 --> 11:04.032
<i>You deserve a sheriff who
puts Holden County's interests</i>

11:04.057 --> 11:05.275
<i>above his own.</i>

11:05.300 --> 11:06.892
<i>I'll defend our way of life</i>

11:06.917 --> 11:09.851
<i>with every ounce of my American blood.</i>

11:21.186 --> 11:22.352
Where is she?

11:22.409 --> 11:24.475
Out of my hands.

11:36.790 --> 11:40.718
Greetings, my name is
Martin Eggers Hyde, PhD.

11:41.054 --> 11:42.720
You're the doctor?

11:42.790 --> 11:44.666
Indeed I am, Mr. Davenport,

11:44.691 --> 11:49.094
or should I say, Mr. Turner?

11:49.369 --> 11:52.426
Yes, I know your actual identity.

11:52.525 --> 11:54.558
And in fact,

11:54.708 --> 11:57.179
an ambitious young banker
even shared with me

11:57.236 --> 11:59.706
this touching photograph of

11:59.812 --> 12:03.414
yourself and your brother
back in simpler times.

12:03.630 --> 12:04.796
Fear not,

12:05.168 --> 12:08.680
that banker took that secret
with him to the grave.

12:08.867 --> 12:10.934
If you hurt Amelia,

12:11.157 --> 12:14.692
I will split you open
from asshole to throat.

12:14.832 --> 12:18.085
That is a brute,
yet effective turn of phrase.

12:18.138 --> 12:22.061
Perhaps you should bring
your linguistic verve

12:22.168 --> 12:23.601
to the airwaves,

12:23.863 --> 12:25.960
broadcast your message
directly to the people.

12:25.985 --> 12:27.919
Here, I've even prepared some remarks

12:27.974 --> 12:30.974
to help you do just that.

12:36.682 --> 12:38.615
You expect me to go on air

12:38.651 --> 12:41.118
and denounce everything I stand for?

12:41.180 --> 12:45.282
Well, I certainly hope
you'll consider it.

12:52.966 --> 12:54.832
What's it going to be,

12:54.925 --> 12:56.234
Preacher Davenport?

12:56.392 --> 12:58.262
Your cause

12:58.351 --> 13:00.651
or your wife?

13:00.970 --> 13:03.408
Now, if you go on the air,

13:03.443 --> 13:05.646
and denounce your divisive behavior...

13:05.745 --> 13:09.851
And the outright lies you and
your wife have been spreading...

13:10.243 --> 13:12.990
We'll let her leave town and live.

13:13.920 --> 13:18.740
I cannot, however, extend the
same promise to you, of course.

13:23.530 --> 13:27.165
I need to talk to her first.

13:29.955 --> 13:32.889
This button lets you talk to her.

13:33.006 --> 13:36.189
This button puts you live on air.

13:36.655 --> 13:39.055
Proceed carefully.

13:51.952 --> 13:54.252
<i>Have they hurt you?</i>

13:55.488 --> 13:57.216
No.

13:58.290 --> 14:00.146
He wants me to denounce the strike,

14:00.187 --> 14:03.268
the Labor Bulletin, and to
tell the farmers to give up.

14:03.336 --> 14:04.980
<i>Don't do it.</i>

14:05.265 --> 14:08.199
He says they'll kill you if I don't.

14:08.474 --> 14:10.153
It's not an empty threat.

14:10.202 --> 14:12.903
After what they did to DL...

14:17.117 --> 14:18.737
They killed him.

14:19.078 --> 14:21.045
DL's dead.

14:30.897 --> 14:33.705
<i>I'm gonna read the sermon
the doctor's written.</i>

14:33.819 --> 14:35.860
<i>Then I presume they'll kill me.</i>

14:41.541 --> 14:43.074
<i>Don't do it.</i>

14:43.109 --> 14:45.143
<i>They're going to kill us both anyway.</i>

14:58.336 --> 15:01.238
<i>Whatever happens, I need you to know</i>

15:01.400 --> 15:04.585
<i>Cynthia's blood is on my hands
just as much as Creeley's.</i>

15:05.720 --> 15:07.944
I never told her who I really was,

15:08.290 --> 15:11.581
or that I was putting her life
in danger by being with her.

15:12.126 --> 15:13.506
<i>I never told her who I was</i>

15:13.531 --> 15:15.526
<i>because I was ashamed of it.</i>

15:17.466 --> 15:20.520
<i>I used to do the same work
that Creeley does.</i>

15:21.617 --> 15:23.730
<i>Same work as the man who killed Sal</i>

15:23.755 --> 15:26.022
<i>and all those workers in Arkansas.</i>

15:26.101 --> 15:28.682
<i>Amelia, I was a thug, a strikebreaker,</i>

15:28.707 --> 15:30.302
<i>a killer for hire.</i>

15:32.213 --> 15:34.280
I killed innocent people

15:34.322 --> 15:36.289
so the Duvall family
could steal their land,

15:36.331 --> 15:38.579
their homes, their farms.

15:39.401 --> 15:41.750
<i>And there's no forgiving me for that.</i>

15:42.243 --> 15:46.378
<i>Ah, it's a moving
confessional, Preacher.</i>

15:46.528 --> 15:49.020
But your wider audience is waiting.

15:49.897 --> 15:51.758
Go ahead. I'm ready.

15:52.147 --> 15:54.480
In three, two...

16:01.248 --> 16:04.796
My name is Preacher
Seth Davenport of Holden, Iowa.

16:05.046 --> 16:07.200
<i>You don't likely know who I am.</i>

16:07.409 --> 16:09.132
<i>But if you've seen revolutionary</i>

16:09.157 --> 16:12.374
<i>religious pamphlets
or communist newspapers</i>

16:12.399 --> 16:14.366
<i>spreading lies about the Duvall family</i>

16:14.422 --> 16:17.490
<i>and other industrialists,
you've seen my work.</i>

16:18.119 --> 16:20.753
After much prayer

16:20.896 --> 16:23.029
and deliberation,

16:23.551 --> 16:25.117
I'd like to make
an important announcement

16:25.142 --> 16:27.109
to the rural masses.

16:33.308 --> 16:35.731
I hereby command
all farmers and workers

16:35.756 --> 16:38.734
and would-be striking men
and women of this state

16:38.759 --> 16:42.065
to see the error of their ways
and immediately stand down.

16:42.231 --> 16:46.032
<i>This un-American war
we are fighting cannot be won,</i>

16:46.587 --> 16:49.588
and it should not be fought.

16:51.965 --> 16:53.563
<i>Despite the lies I've had planted</i>

16:53.588 --> 16:56.340
<i>in the Iowa Labor Bulletin,
the truth is,</i>

16:57.535 --> 16:59.968
our real savior is progress.

17:02.244 --> 17:04.407
For who needs...

17:11.933 --> 17:15.602
For who needs Jesus Christ
when you've got Henry Ford?

17:37.806 --> 17:39.272
<i>We are experiencing a temporary</i>

17:39.307 --> 17:42.225
<i>technical difficulty,
but we will return shortly</i>

17:42.270 --> 17:44.770
<i>with the rest of
Preacher Davenport's sermon.</i>

17:44.813 --> 17:46.079
<i>For now,</i>

17:46.280 --> 17:48.723
<i>please do enjoy the dulcet tones of...</i>

17:48.889 --> 17:50.689
<i>Some hillbilly.</i>

17:51.586 --> 17:53.386
Who the hell is that?

17:53.622 --> 17:55.405
The man who owns me.

18:10.818 --> 18:13.085
Fall back.

18:13.829 --> 18:14.928
Keep firing.

18:27.942 --> 18:29.725
- George!
- Get the hell out of here.

18:29.911 --> 18:31.144
Let's go!

18:32.727 --> 18:34.794
Ah!

18:37.828 --> 18:38.994
I imagine you're staring up

18:39.029 --> 18:40.975
at your worst nightmare, ain't you?

18:41.532 --> 18:43.504
Take off your hood!

18:47.471 --> 18:50.290
You better kill me now
before I get my hands on your...

19:04.455 --> 19:06.161
Run. Go on!

19:07.391 --> 19:08.841
Go! Go!

19:38.696 --> 19:40.629
She okay?

19:42.793 --> 19:44.626
No.

19:45.816 --> 19:47.515
She's not.

19:49.346 --> 19:51.046
Help.

19:51.201 --> 19:53.528
Please, help.

20:14.157 --> 20:16.424
The hell was that?

20:17.776 --> 20:19.736
I told her what I used to do

20:21.505 --> 20:23.412
and what I did to Cynthia.

20:24.668 --> 20:26.401
If we make it out of this alive,

20:26.509 --> 20:28.509
I'll confess.

20:30.107 --> 20:32.192
You can't keep doing this...

20:33.550 --> 20:35.780
and I can't keep running from my past.

20:39.048 --> 20:41.748
Let's just focus on
the alive part, huh?

20:41.947 --> 20:43.644
Was there anyone else in here?

20:43.740 --> 20:45.512
I don't think so.

20:52.376 --> 20:55.344
Two of those hooded bastards got away.

20:59.943 --> 21:03.077
One of them must be Eggers Hyde.

21:17.708 --> 21:19.107
How is Preston?

21:19.132 --> 21:22.100
He's not out of the woods yet.

21:22.320 --> 21:25.437
His commitment to his
family is admirable.

21:25.799 --> 21:27.672
I do hope he pulls through.

21:27.805 --> 21:30.393
I know you're all scared
and troubled by recent events,

21:30.520 --> 21:31.791
and though it's unfortunate

21:31.825 --> 21:33.974
the Black Legion's blockades
have kept the farmers

21:33.999 --> 21:35.387
from coming in and placing their votes,

21:35.412 --> 21:38.464
I'd like to personally commend
each one of you townsfolk

21:38.572 --> 21:41.740
for voting in the face of such
lawlessness and disorder.

21:46.847 --> 21:49.127
Holy mother of God.

21:56.857 --> 21:59.224
I think y'all are gonna stand down,

21:59.366 --> 22:00.830
or else me and my cohorts here...

22:00.855 --> 22:02.737
We're gonna take our turns with you

22:02.856 --> 22:05.507
and give what's left over
to the preacher's wife.

22:07.609 --> 22:08.977
What's this about, Don?

22:09.002 --> 22:11.101
Melvin Stubbs, you are under arrest

22:11.126 --> 22:13.701
for the kidnapping of Amelia Davenport,

22:14.280 --> 22:16.704
the murder of DL Sullivan,

22:16.809 --> 22:20.578
and for leading the Black
Legion's attack on this county.

22:21.247 --> 22:23.653
Knew this campaign was making progress,

22:23.710 --> 22:26.944
but I had no idea we were doing so well

22:26.980 --> 22:30.047
that you'd make up wild stories
so you could arrest me.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.151
All theatrics, people.

22:36.256 --> 22:38.182
Amelia!

22:44.271 --> 22:46.384
Thank goodness you're okay.

22:46.472 --> 22:49.206
We thought you might be dead.

22:50.156 --> 22:53.317
Melvin Stubbs is lucky
the sheriff got to him first.

22:54.318 --> 22:57.070
I'd like nothing more than
to watch that man burn.

22:59.356 --> 23:00.969
What do you mean, watch that man burn?

23:00.994 --> 23:02.260
It's a common turn of phrase.

23:02.285 --> 23:03.685
Certainly you wouldn't be capable

23:03.710 --> 23:04.810
of such a thing as murder.

23:04.835 --> 23:06.381
Yeah, tell that to the strikebreaker

23:06.406 --> 23:08.572
who killed my first husband.

23:09.072 --> 23:10.222
Yes,

23:10.287 --> 23:12.468
in Marion County, Arkansas.

23:13.403 --> 23:15.369
Did you watch that man burn?

23:20.203 --> 23:22.456
I tied that son of a bitch to his car,

23:22.872 --> 23:25.164
doused him with gasoline...

23:26.749 --> 23:28.603
and then...

23:38.541 --> 23:40.086
Martha...

23:41.384 --> 23:43.601
if something were to happen to me...

23:45.035 --> 23:47.559
would you be willing
to take care of Brittany?

23:47.904 --> 23:49.383
Of course.

23:50.340 --> 23:52.612
But why would you ask that?

23:56.085 --> 23:58.152
Idle curiosity.

24:01.218 --> 24:02.577
<i>I've been told that the Black Legion</i>

24:02.602 --> 24:04.065
have abandoned their blockades.

24:04.221 --> 24:05.972
The phone lines are back up.

24:06.156 --> 24:07.697
Call every farmer
you know and tell them

24:07.722 --> 24:09.021
to drive into town and vote.

24:09.226 --> 24:10.712
Polls close in 30 minutes.

24:10.737 --> 24:11.858
Preacher Seth,

24:11.928 --> 24:14.231
half our farms have been ruined.

24:14.478 --> 24:16.489
Most of the food we have
stored up is been destroyed.

24:16.514 --> 24:18.683
I mean, thanks to
your church's benefactor,

24:18.708 --> 24:20.196
we have enough money
to make it through winter but...

24:20.221 --> 24:22.233
But then it's just gonna
start all over again.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.488
I heard you on the radio...
You're right, we can't win.

24:24.513 --> 24:25.564
Those weren't my words.

24:25.589 --> 24:26.991
I was forced to give that sermon.

24:27.016 --> 24:28.546
That doesn't make it any less true.

24:28.571 --> 24:30.555
Look around, nothing's changed.

24:30.891 --> 24:33.251
If we keep putting up a fight,
they'll keep coming after us.

24:34.656 --> 24:37.024
They're gonna come after us anyways.

24:37.770 --> 24:40.497
Might as well be for
something that we believe in.

24:41.725 --> 24:43.692
And I don't know about the rest of you,

24:44.006 --> 24:47.808
but I'm not just fighting
for fair food prices anymore.

24:48.878 --> 24:51.118
Now I'm fighting for you, Victor...

24:51.678 --> 24:54.989
To be able to work your farm
and raise your family in peace.

24:57.794 --> 24:59.184
And Horace,

24:59.743 --> 25:01.175
I'm fighting for you...

25:01.348 --> 25:03.034
To be able to rebuild
your farm into something

25:03.059 --> 25:05.826
that you'll be proud
to hand down to your girls.

25:07.704 --> 25:09.934
We have to have each other's backs,

25:10.745 --> 25:13.369
and last night that meant
taking up our guns.

25:13.562 --> 25:16.388
Well, right now, that means
filling out a ballot.

25:17.027 --> 25:19.350
But as long as we haven't given up,

25:20.697 --> 25:22.609
they haven't won.

25:26.970 --> 25:28.720
Well, you heard the man.

25:29.039 --> 25:30.338
Let's cast those votes.

25:42.233 --> 25:43.333
Thanks, Reg.

25:43.855 --> 25:45.508
Yeah, say hello to the missus.

25:45.995 --> 25:47.416
All right.

25:48.518 --> 25:50.284
So, the state police'll

25:50.393 --> 25:52.827
be transporting you boys
to Fort Madison

25:52.852 --> 25:54.151
for your own protection.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.817
I'll be handing you over
as soon as they arrive.

25:56.894 --> 25:58.961
And what about those farmers?

25:59.022 --> 26:01.192
And that strikebreaker,
and that preacher

26:01.231 --> 26:03.432
that helped Sam Jr. Escape punishment?

26:03.460 --> 26:04.892
Well, it turns out

26:05.139 --> 26:07.465
Sam Jr. has an airtight alibi,

26:07.958 --> 26:10.892
so murder charges have been dropped.

26:16.606 --> 26:18.140
What's wrong?

26:18.268 --> 26:20.668
They just finished
counting up the votes.

26:20.844 --> 26:23.292
Melvin Stubbs is the new
sheriff of Holden County.

26:26.557 --> 26:29.765
Murdering son of a bitch
won by seven votes.

26:38.307 --> 26:39.874
Where we gonna go?

26:39.997 --> 26:41.897
Mm-mm-mm, Tahiti?

26:42.018 --> 26:43.451
Toledo?

26:43.502 --> 26:44.953
Tucumcari?

26:44.996 --> 26:46.536
Doesn't matter,
we just gotta get out of here

26:46.561 --> 26:47.660
as fast as possible.

27:07.183 --> 27:09.317
Creeley Turner.

27:11.141 --> 27:13.007
May I please come in?

27:14.584 --> 27:16.871
Mr. Duvall, what are you doing here?

27:16.994 --> 27:19.060
Please, call me Tennyson.

27:19.148 --> 27:20.988
Oh, my Turner.

27:21.831 --> 27:25.555
I wouldn't make yourself
too familiar, Mr. Turner.

27:25.814 --> 27:27.990
Lovely abode.

27:28.598 --> 27:29.890
Why are you packing up?

27:29.973 --> 27:32.512
Oh, well, my guess is

27:32.816 --> 27:35.433
Mr. Turner assumes
he's on to the next assignment

27:35.458 --> 27:39.260
after a job well done here in Holden.

27:40.796 --> 27:44.331
What would your name be, young miss?

27:46.230 --> 27:47.816
Aw, she's just a dumb whore

27:47.851 --> 27:49.959
trying to milk a dollar
out of me before I go.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.014
Go on, get out of here.

27:58.362 --> 28:01.095
I said, git, whore!

28:01.672 --> 28:04.550
Don't need your type around here.

28:05.682 --> 28:08.243
Pardon her.

28:08.504 --> 28:10.704
You know how these hussies can get.

28:10.828 --> 28:13.178
So, Martin called to tell me

28:13.203 --> 28:15.478
of your great success here in Holden.

28:16.813 --> 28:17.973
He has?

28:18.027 --> 28:21.128
I admit I was concerned
when I saw the razed farms

28:21.153 --> 28:23.082
and Sheriff's bullet-ridden car

28:23.109 --> 28:24.185
in the middle of Main Street.

28:24.221 --> 28:26.402
But then I explained to Mr. Duvall

28:26.427 --> 28:28.994
how this preacher, Seth Davenport,

28:29.019 --> 28:31.716
had recruited not just the farmers

28:31.775 --> 28:34.062
but also the vile Black Legion

28:34.124 --> 28:35.977
and the corrupt sheriff's department

28:36.002 --> 28:38.169
to oppose our progressive efforts

28:38.641 --> 28:40.898
and how you had managed to get both

28:40.923 --> 28:43.690
our preferred candidate
Melvin Stubbs elected

28:43.720 --> 28:45.687
and bust the strike...

28:45.722 --> 28:47.933
All without a disturbed
word making it into

28:47.958 --> 28:49.857
any of the legitimate newspapers.

28:49.946 --> 28:51.909
It's a commendable
achievement, Creeley,

28:52.061 --> 28:53.591
But you should know

28:53.744 --> 28:56.253
you won't be leaving town anytime soon.

29:15.799 --> 29:17.394
Thank you.

29:19.023 --> 29:20.584
For what?

29:20.804 --> 29:22.510
For saving my life.

29:33.930 --> 29:35.881
This is what I wanted.

29:36.006 --> 29:37.885
To know the truth.

29:44.053 --> 29:47.721
DL was just a kid with his
entire life ahead of him.

29:47.909 --> 29:50.820
And I bat my eyes,
yank him into our cause,

29:50.845 --> 29:53.034
and now he's dead.

29:53.648 --> 29:56.549
Melvin Stubbs is going
to be sheriff now,

29:57.606 --> 29:59.606
and the Duvall family and my father

29:59.631 --> 30:02.696
are going to do God
knows what to this town.

30:04.525 --> 30:07.489
The preacher act,
our so-called marriage...

30:07.862 --> 30:09.795
It's only a story we told ourselves

30:09.820 --> 30:13.386
so we could believe
we were actually decent people.

30:14.209 --> 30:15.565
It's real to me.

30:15.650 --> 30:17.225
Which part?

30:18.306 --> 30:20.059
All of it...

30:20.375 --> 30:22.068
Our marriage,

30:22.253 --> 30:24.314
our relationship with God.

30:25.246 --> 30:27.619
You mean your relationship with God,

30:27.802 --> 30:30.711
because if you open your eyes
and take a look around,

30:30.758 --> 30:33.859
it's pretty goddamn clear
we're on our own.

30:35.957 --> 30:38.172
I'd really prefer if you

30:38.233 --> 30:41.500
didn't take our Lord's name in vain.

30:41.963 --> 30:44.110
And I would really prefer

30:45.066 --> 30:48.171
if I didn't suddenly see
Sal's charred remains

30:48.196 --> 30:50.643
every time I look at your face now.

31:15.640 --> 31:16.640
Hello?

31:16.794 --> 31:18.542
I'm DL's landlady.

31:18.673 --> 31:21.541
I know he would want
Amelia to have this.

31:21.655 --> 31:23.588
Thank you.

31:28.276 --> 31:30.409
What did she want?

31:31.399 --> 31:34.434
She said DL would
want you to have this.

32:14.489 --> 32:17.660
I must admit transferring
powers is a bit tricky

32:17.685 --> 32:20.053
when the newly-elected
sheriff is behind bars.

32:20.348 --> 32:23.758
Uncle Don?

32:23.830 --> 32:26.297
Yeah, well, Melvin beat
me at my own game, Raymond.

32:26.501 --> 32:28.397
Once he takes control of this station,

32:28.435 --> 32:31.569
I don't imagine
his charges are gonna stick.

32:31.919 --> 32:33.399
Glad to see you're dealing with this

32:33.424 --> 32:35.471
like an adult, Don.

32:37.392 --> 32:40.980
Well, one adult to another,
I was wondering

32:42.016 --> 32:44.303
what will be your policy going forward

32:44.328 --> 32:48.464
concerning Holden's
minority population?

32:53.060 --> 32:54.744
Deputy Tanner Phillips,

32:54.769 --> 32:56.531
do you have a policy statement?

32:56.664 --> 32:58.999
If you're talking about that nosy whore

32:59.079 --> 33:01.212
or the uppity dairy farmer,

33:01.322 --> 33:04.102
then our policy is to find a tall tree

33:04.432 --> 33:06.104
and a short rope.

33:08.910 --> 33:10.687
Well, I suppose that's what

33:10.712 --> 33:12.857
people are looking for these days...

33:15.216 --> 33:19.040
Men with the courage
of their own convictions.

33:31.094 --> 33:33.508
Lord, Don, what are you doing this for?

33:33.541 --> 33:36.459
Because that nosy whore is my daughter,

33:37.458 --> 33:40.899
and it's high time I started
being a father to that girl.

33:53.728 --> 33:55.480
Raymond,
when the state police get here,

33:55.505 --> 33:58.267
tell them I'm over at my place,
drinking a fine scotch

33:58.292 --> 34:00.866
and listening to
the celestial sounds of...

34:04.685 --> 34:06.351
Of Memphis Pearl.

34:26.411 --> 34:28.351
What are we doing here, Mr. Duvall?

34:28.635 --> 34:30.572
Breaking ground.

34:32.553 --> 34:36.221
Go ahead and grab that shovel,
Mr. Turner.

34:38.888 --> 34:40.828
Some of the farmers have already begun

34:40.853 --> 34:42.572
selling off their land.

34:42.730 --> 34:46.297
Mr. Duvall will be bringing the
modern world to Holden County.

34:52.406 --> 34:54.947
My family and a few
select business partners

34:54.972 --> 34:57.406
have been looking for somewhere we can

34:57.431 --> 34:59.464
research and develop
the next generation

34:59.513 --> 35:02.614
of technological, chemical,
and scientific innovations...

35:02.783 --> 35:04.651
Without troublesome meddling,
of course.

35:04.745 --> 35:09.154
Just imagine if we could not
only evolve chemical weaponry

35:09.190 --> 35:10.715
to unleash on our foreign enemies,

35:10.740 --> 35:14.433
but also design uniforms for
our soldiers to protect them

35:14.614 --> 35:16.841
from that selfsame weaponry.

35:17.098 --> 35:19.913
The great America century
will be built through science,

35:20.013 --> 35:23.725
Mr. Turner, not cornbread and biscuits.

35:23.957 --> 35:26.991
Creeley...

35:27.134 --> 35:30.268
It truly is stunning
what you've accomplished here.

35:30.577 --> 35:32.845
However did you manage it?

35:33.030 --> 35:34.656
Uh, it's, uh,

35:34.743 --> 35:37.623
it's a complicated situation,
Mr. Duvall,

35:37.670 --> 35:39.173
and, uh,

35:39.539 --> 35:41.596
I'm not exactly sure how to explain it.

35:41.621 --> 35:44.160
Ah, let's not be falsely modest.

35:44.698 --> 35:48.166
I've already told Mr. Duvall
what splendid work you've done.

35:52.544 --> 35:54.466
You shot me?

35:56.137 --> 35:57.703
Oh, my God.

35:57.978 --> 35:59.438
Oh, my God, I'm bleeding.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.768
Did you really think
I was gonna buy all this?

36:02.510 --> 36:04.676
Well, yes.

36:05.156 --> 36:06.250
Obviously.

36:06.303 --> 36:08.147
That's always been
your worst trait, Martin.

36:08.182 --> 36:10.382
You mistake cleverness for wisdom

36:10.417 --> 36:11.995
and underestimate the intelligence

36:12.020 --> 36:14.354
of your fellow man.

36:14.642 --> 36:18.457
That's why I was grooming
John Dyson to replace you.

36:18.545 --> 36:20.311
You were?

36:20.386 --> 36:23.421
Dyson was reporting to me
ever since he arrived here.

36:23.556 --> 36:27.758
So, after he called to inform
you that you'd somehow assigned

36:27.808 --> 36:31.443
the Preacher Seth Davenport's
long lost brother to stop him,

36:31.892 --> 36:33.800
he informed me as well.

36:33.953 --> 36:36.987
So, I know you killed poor
John Dyson to cover that up.

36:37.328 --> 36:39.311
And I know that you ordered Dyson

36:39.346 --> 36:41.236
to enlist the Black Legion
here in Holden,

36:41.261 --> 36:43.345
and thereby risked
my family's good name.

36:43.423 --> 36:46.524
We're a family of
philanthropists, art lovers,

36:46.549 --> 36:48.938
and progressive entrepreneurs, Martin.

36:49.529 --> 36:51.498
Not killers and thugs.

37:00.566 --> 37:03.018
Creeley, I've got
good news and bad news.

37:03.698 --> 37:05.600
Which would you like to hear first?

37:08.394 --> 37:09.860
The good news.

37:10.039 --> 37:12.845
An important position
in my family's organization

37:13.095 --> 37:14.957
has just opened up.

37:22.058 --> 37:24.366
I'd like to offer you that position.

37:25.392 --> 37:27.593
You want me to take the place of him?

37:27.691 --> 37:29.477
I'd be disappointed if you didn't.

37:29.630 --> 37:31.170
Offer accepted.

37:32.566 --> 37:34.169
And the, uh,

37:34.281 --> 37:35.781
the bad news?

37:36.003 --> 37:37.644
Your brother remains

37:37.784 --> 37:39.250
an obstacle.

37:50.449 --> 37:53.617
Sorry to interrupt
your evening's music.

37:55.189 --> 37:58.951
My name is Preacher
Seth Davenport of Holden, Iowa,

37:59.970 --> 38:01.627
and earlier today,
you may have heard me

38:01.662 --> 38:03.285
tell the farmers and workers

38:03.310 --> 38:05.610
and would-be strikers to stand down,

38:06.666 --> 38:08.946
<i>that our fight could not be won.</i>

38:09.003 --> 38:11.580
<i>But I was interrupted
before I could finish,</i>

38:11.805 --> 38:14.046
<i>which is important because
what I was gonna say next</i>

38:14.121 --> 38:16.856
<i>was that those are the very
words the rich and powerful</i>

38:16.910 --> 38:19.177
<i>in this country want me to say to you.</i>

38:19.542 --> 38:22.481
But the truth is
something else entirely.

38:22.848 --> 38:26.171
<i>It may sound strange to hear
a man of God say this,</i>

38:26.196 --> 38:28.290
<i>but... the truth is,</i>

38:28.315 --> 38:31.617
<i>America is a land
of outlaws and outcasts,</i>

38:31.892 --> 38:33.687
bitches and sons of bitches,

38:33.712 --> 38:35.235
wanderers and scoundrels,

38:35.260 --> 38:37.622
bastards and sinners and frauds.

38:37.997 --> 38:40.397
Always has been.

38:40.816 --> 38:43.322
<i>And I believe we're
all the better for it.</i>

38:44.069 --> 38:46.194
<i>But there are powerful
interests out there</i>

38:46.219 --> 38:49.885
<i>who are banking on you
being well-behaved, quiet,</i>

38:49.910 --> 38:51.767
<i>and easily ruled.</i>

38:52.012 --> 38:55.280
In fact, they're betting
their entire fortunes on it.

38:55.503 --> 38:57.564
I know because

38:57.952 --> 39:00.019
I used to be on their side.

39:00.580 --> 39:02.460
I was a strikebreaker,

39:02.936 --> 39:04.938
a gun for hire.

39:05.112 --> 39:07.479
<i>So, I have no right</i>

39:07.561 --> 39:10.829
<i>to tell you what to do with your lives.</i>

39:11.031 --> 39:13.031
<i>But since I've been on the other side,</i>

39:13.067 --> 39:16.732
<i>I can tell you that no one
is coming to save you.</i>

39:17.071 --> 39:19.127
<i>The government's
not coming to save you,</i>

39:19.152 --> 39:21.819
<i>and you've probably
figured that out by now.</i>

39:21.908 --> 39:24.175
Science and technology
aren't gonna save you.

39:24.200 --> 39:27.334
Celebrities and businessmen
won't save you.

39:28.698 --> 39:31.083
Not even religion will save you.

39:32.909 --> 39:34.829
So, it's up to us,

39:35.522 --> 39:37.038
and God.

39:37.189 --> 39:39.380
It's up to us to come together

39:39.409 --> 39:41.927
as God's body here on Earth.

39:42.135 --> 39:44.669
<i>Bitch or bastard, scoundrel or fraud,</i>

39:44.694 --> 39:47.276
<i>I'm asking for your help.</i>

39:47.528 --> 39:49.071
<i>If you can hear me,</i>

39:49.185 --> 39:52.170
<i>I want you to grab
your nearest firearm,</i>

39:52.278 --> 39:53.932
<i>walk out your front door,</i>

39:53.974 --> 39:57.231
<i>and fire a warning shot into the air,</i>

39:57.430 --> 39:59.797
<i>because I want every crooked politician</i>

39:59.892 --> 40:02.745
<i>and big shot industrialist
and would-be tyrant</i>

40:02.788 --> 40:05.422
<i>in this land to know
that you're out there.</i>

40:05.775 --> 40:09.334
I want them to know
you will not be tamed.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.629
You will not be ripped off.

40:11.792 --> 40:14.211
You will not be broken.

40:14.795 --> 40:16.588
We're fighting

40:17.097 --> 40:19.611
for the soul of this country,

40:20.438 --> 40:23.915
and we can't win
without you on our side.

41:27.233 --> 41:29.566
Good Lord, DL.

41:30.137 --> 41:32.806
I'm actually jealous.

41:44.650 --> 41:45.910
Connie?

41:46.773 --> 41:48.201
Is something wrong?

41:48.488 --> 41:50.670
I very much need us to talk,

41:51.325 --> 41:53.527
one widow to another.

43:18.245 --> 43:20.866
Amelia, have you been
listening to the radio?

43:22.321 --> 43:23.501
This is how we're gonna do it.

43:23.526 --> 43:25.580
This is how we're gonna
bring people together.

43:25.645 --> 43:28.346
I bet even God Himself can hear it.

43:32.105 --> 43:33.244
Amelia?
