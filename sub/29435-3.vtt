WEBVTT

00:10.706 --> 00:12.055
Hey, top of the
mornin', Officer.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.709
Long time, Lenny.
What do you got?

00:13.752 --> 00:14.840
Machine parts.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.364
Picked them up in Norfolk.

00:16.407 --> 00:17.539
Proudly serving our Navy

00:17.582 --> 00:18.844
before I've even had
my breakfast.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.543
Most important meal of the day.[laughs]

00:21.586 --> 00:22.892
All right, let me get
a quick look here.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.372
You bet.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.727
So how you been?

00:31.770 --> 00:33.859
Oh, you know,
living the dream.

00:33.903 --> 00:34.860
You?
[laughs]

00:34.904 --> 00:36.210
Eh, same.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.429
Busy month. Deliveries up
and down the coast.

00:38.473 --> 00:40.083
As the Man In Black
used to say,

00:40.127 --> 00:42.433
[mimics Johnny Cash]:
I've been everywhere.

00:42.477 --> 00:43.739
Everywhere but a car wash.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.698
You don't smell that?

00:46.742 --> 00:48.178
[sniffs]
Is that my truck?

00:48.222 --> 00:49.788
[scoffs] It's not our gate.

00:49.832 --> 00:51.616
You move any meat
or fish lately?

00:51.660 --> 00:54.532
LENNY:
Uh, frozen shrimp down
in Raleigh last week.

00:54.576 --> 00:56.186
Maybe a crate broke.
[sniffs]

00:56.230 --> 00:58.754
I'll hose her down as soon
as we're done here.

01:00.799 --> 01:04.064
I don't think a
hose will do it.

01:07.023 --> 01:09.069
â™ª

01:40.839 --> 01:42.102
[elevator bell dings]

01:45.148 --> 01:46.149
After you.

01:46.193 --> 01:47.150
No, please.

01:47.194 --> 01:48.238
Ladies first.

01:48.282 --> 01:49.848
You gotta be kidding me.

01:52.721 --> 01:53.983
Ah, there you are.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.811
The world's greatest
crimefighters.

01:55.854 --> 01:57.291
Yeah, that's us.

01:57.334 --> 01:58.596
BISHOP:
Morning, Jack.

01:59.597 --> 02:00.903
Morning.

02:00.946 --> 02:02.383
Okay, so...

02:02.426 --> 02:04.167
what's going on here?

02:04.211 --> 02:06.952
Uh, nothing. Why?

02:06.996 --> 02:08.606
With that greeting?

02:08.650 --> 02:11.783
Well, feeling a little,
uh, burned out, I guess.

02:11.827 --> 02:14.830
Doesn't feel like burned out.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.658
I am sensing

02:16.701 --> 02:18.138
a real serious vibe
off you guys.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.269
You feel that?

02:19.313 --> 02:21.445
Oh, here it comes.

02:21.489 --> 02:22.707
What kind of vibe?

02:22.751 --> 02:25.928
Like an unfinished business
kind of vibe.

02:25.971 --> 02:27.495
Like maybe Vance was right.

02:27.538 --> 02:28.800
Right about what?

02:28.844 --> 02:30.759
He's concerned about
agent morale,

02:30.802 --> 02:33.153
and wants me
to evaluate things.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.024
What's wrong with our morale?

02:35.067 --> 02:37.113
In one word, Ziva.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.462
Oh, my God, seriously?

02:38.506 --> 02:41.639
He just wants to be sure
that her sudden arrival

02:41.683 --> 02:44.338
and departure hasn't upset
the team chemistry.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.253
So if any of you would like

02:46.296 --> 02:48.429
to talk about things,
my door is wide open.

02:48.472 --> 02:50.431
Okay. [laughs]

02:50.474 --> 02:51.606
Okay, I know what this is.

02:51.649 --> 02:53.042
This is punishment

02:53.085 --> 02:55.349
for you two lying
to his face.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.177
Wha...?Are we still stuck on that?

02:57.220 --> 02:58.830
It wasn't a lie.It was a lie.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.441
It was a necessary lie,
and we were all there.

03:00.484 --> 03:02.486
Whoa, whoa, whoa, see?

03:02.530 --> 03:04.009
This is the vibe

03:04.053 --> 03:05.446
that I was
talking about.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.143
And, Nick, I'm sorry
if you feel

03:07.187 --> 03:09.319
a talk with me is
some form of punishment.

03:09.363 --> 03:11.147
Jack, that's not what I meant.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.236
Depends.
What are we talking about?

03:13.280 --> 03:15.673
We are talking about
psych evals, boss,

03:15.717 --> 03:17.109
in the wake of
Hurricane Ziva.

03:17.153 --> 03:19.242
It's not a mandatory
evaluation.

03:19.286 --> 03:22.071
Vance just strongly
recommends that each of you

03:22.114 --> 03:25.030
stop by my office
if you need to talk.

03:26.641 --> 03:27.990
No need for me, I'm cool.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.687
Me, too.Me three.

03:29.731 --> 03:32.603
Gear up, then.
We got a body.

03:32.647 --> 03:34.736
Uh, door's always open
to you, too, Gibbs.

03:34.779 --> 03:36.477
I'll be happy to listen
if you want to--

03:36.520 --> 03:39.175
Yeah, no. Of course.McGEE: Where to, boss?

03:39.219 --> 03:41.090
It's close. Let's go.

03:41.133 --> 03:44.746
[sighs sharply]
That went well.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.270
What do you got there, Palmer?

03:47.314 --> 03:51.579
We have an unidentified male,
mid-30s,

03:51.622 --> 03:52.884
stuffed in the undercarriage.

03:54.756 --> 03:55.800
Pretty torn up.

03:55.844 --> 03:58.673
JIMMY:
Yeah, by the road, mostly.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.370
That gravel must hit
like shrapnel.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.590
Tore the plastic
right off his face.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.768
I hope after he was dead.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.900
DUCKY:
Uh, let's hope so, Nicholas.

04:08.944 --> 04:12.904
Most of those external wounds
would have happened postmortem.

04:12.948 --> 04:15.385
It's your first crime scene
in a... in a while, Ducky.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.257
Yes, well, it's

04:17.300 --> 04:18.910
thanks to the
convenience of

04:18.954 --> 04:21.261
having a victim
close to my parking spot.

04:21.304 --> 04:23.654
You need any assistance,
Dr. Palmer?

04:23.698 --> 04:26.266
Oh, thank you, Doctor, no.
I'm good.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.964
[chuckles]
Yes, indeed you are.

04:30.095 --> 04:32.097
Hey, Nick, get the driver.

04:32.141 --> 04:34.274
Copy.

04:34.317 --> 04:36.406
Hey, so, how'd he
get under there?

04:36.450 --> 04:37.755
Well, it wasn't by accident.

04:37.799 --> 04:39.366
I mean, someone wrapped him up
in this plastic

04:39.409 --> 04:41.933
and then wedged him above
these metal crossbeams.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.108
How long ago?

04:43.152 --> 04:44.588
Uh, based on decomp,

04:44.632 --> 04:47.287
I'd say two, three days, maybe.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.810
Uh, here's Lenny.

04:48.853 --> 04:51.595
I-I swear I don't know how
that guy got up under there.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.336
Where you been
this last week?

04:53.380 --> 04:56.121
Oh, man, uh, yesterday
I was in Burke

04:56.165 --> 04:57.949
delivering
plumbing supplies.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.864
Day before, I moved
a mobile home

04:59.908 --> 05:01.431
from Sterling to Rockville.

05:01.475 --> 05:04.129
Friday I-I hauled a load
of apples from this orchard

05:04.173 --> 05:05.392
over in Fairfax.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.089
I got a printout
in the truck.
We need...

05:07.132 --> 05:09.047
every pick-up, every drop-off,

05:09.091 --> 05:10.962
every rest stop in between.

05:11.006 --> 05:12.834
Yes, sir.

05:12.877 --> 05:14.792
Well, orchard sounds right
to me.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.533
Based on what?

05:16.577 --> 05:19.797
Based on these clumps of grass,

05:19.841 --> 05:21.799
dirt stuffed in
with the body.

05:21.843 --> 05:23.497
What is this sliver?

05:23.540 --> 05:26.326
Looks like glass. Maybe ceramic.

05:26.369 --> 05:28.023
Any more in there?

05:28.066 --> 05:31.331
Oh, yeah, there's more.
There's lots more. [grunts]

05:31.374 --> 05:35.247
All sizes, shapes, colors.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.466
Possible murder weapon?

05:36.510 --> 05:39.861
Well, maybe a heavy vase
or a sculpture.

05:39.904 --> 05:41.558
Wouldn't be the first time.

05:41.602 --> 05:44.169
No, this is definitely a first.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.823
First of what?

05:45.867 --> 05:47.303
You don't recognize it?

05:48.391 --> 05:50.219
Looks like a little hat.

05:50.262 --> 05:53.396
Maybe worn by...
a little man?

05:53.440 --> 05:54.745
No way.

05:54.789 --> 05:56.530
No way what?

05:58.401 --> 05:59.359
What is it?

06:03.450 --> 06:04.886
Death by garden gnome.

06:14.504 --> 06:17.594
I mean, who knew that there
were so many varieties?

06:17.638 --> 06:20.380
Do you mind?
I'm still traumatized.

06:20.423 --> 06:21.511
Well, at least now you'll have

06:21.555 --> 06:22.512
something to talk
to Sloane about.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.166
Okay, I'm not that traumatized.

06:24.209 --> 06:26.429
Actually, this may have
a worse effect on agent morale

06:26.473 --> 06:28.300
than anything having
to do with Ziva.

06:28.344 --> 06:29.693
We still talking about her?

06:29.737 --> 06:32.130
No, boss. Fingerprints
ID our victim

06:32.174 --> 06:33.828
as Elijah Buck.

06:33.871 --> 06:37.179
34. Current address
listed in Annandale.

06:37.222 --> 06:40.312
Divorced, no kids, works as
a grocery store manager.

06:40.356 --> 06:42.097
Only one next of kin.
A brother.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.186
Peter. Lives in Reston.

06:44.229 --> 06:46.362
And the trailer park where the
driver picked up the mobile home

06:46.406 --> 06:48.016
is located right between them.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.931
[cell phone ringing]Okay, trailer park it is.

06:49.974 --> 06:53.325
Make contact.
Notify the brother.

06:53.369 --> 06:56.503
Yes, Palmer,
I'm on my way down.

06:56.546 --> 06:59.984
I'm sorry, but there are
way too many creepy critters

07:00.028 --> 07:01.464
living in the woods
without having to

07:01.508 --> 07:05.555
worry about gnomes
and leprechauns and elves.

07:05.599 --> 07:07.992
None of which actually exist.

07:08.036 --> 07:10.647
Tell that to six-year-old me
walking in on her cousins

07:10.691 --> 07:12.519
watching some evil
leprechaun movie.

07:12.562 --> 07:14.912
Trust me,
they are alive

07:14.956 --> 07:17.524
and well and residing
right up here.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.569
Talk to me, Palmer.

07:19.613 --> 07:22.703
Well, Kasie's afraid
of leprechauns.

07:22.746 --> 07:23.747
It's more of a healthy distrust.

07:23.791 --> 07:26.446
Yeah? Me, too.

07:28.056 --> 07:30.014
What do you got?You so get me.

07:30.058 --> 07:31.451
Our killer

07:31.494 --> 07:32.452
is about a foot and a half tall,

07:32.495 --> 07:35.019
composed of thick ceramic clay,

07:35.063 --> 07:38.370
waterproof enamel,
and a ton of hidden evidence

07:38.414 --> 07:40.024
just waiting for me to find it.

07:40.068 --> 07:41.765
Are you sure this is
the murder weapon?

07:41.809 --> 07:44.420
It's the gnome's hat
for sure.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.118
Perfectly matches
this impact injury

07:47.162 --> 07:48.729
Landed like a--
a heavy spear

07:48.772 --> 07:50.774
against the squamosal suture.

07:50.818 --> 07:54.561
That's the soft spot
right above the temple.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.084
Leprechauns?

07:56.127 --> 07:59.435
Million-to-one shot.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.176
The old gnome to the dome.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.309
[clicks tongue]

08:06.486 --> 08:09.358
McGee, is that you?

08:09.401 --> 08:10.359
Oh, hey, Jack.

08:10.402 --> 08:12.927
Hey. What brings you here?

08:12.970 --> 08:14.363
Oh, I'm not here.

08:14.406 --> 08:15.407
Huh?

08:15.451 --> 08:16.931
I mean, I, you know,

08:16.974 --> 08:18.410
I am here right now.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.674
It's only 'cause our printer
ran out of ink,

08:20.717 --> 08:21.979
and the supply closet's
that way,

08:22.023 --> 08:23.677
and, you know,
your door's open, so...

08:23.720 --> 08:26.244
As I said it would be.

08:26.288 --> 08:27.942
You know what,
as long as I'm here...

08:27.985 --> 08:29.770
Please, have a seat.

08:29.813 --> 08:31.423
Uh, that's okay, I'm not gonna.

08:31.467 --> 08:32.816
Um, won't take long.

08:32.860 --> 08:35.340
Besides, it's not about me.

08:35.384 --> 08:36.951
I mean, sure,
Ziva could have said good-bye.

08:36.994 --> 08:38.256
That would have been
nice to hear,

08:38.300 --> 08:40.563
but it's okay;
again, not about me.

08:41.825 --> 08:42.913
Bishop.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.915
What's wrong with Bishop?

08:44.959 --> 08:48.440
Well, nothing serious,

08:48.484 --> 08:51.400
but... it's like everything's
a little different

08:51.443 --> 08:53.184
since... you know.

08:53.228 --> 08:54.664
Since meeting Ziva.

08:54.708 --> 08:58.059
Yes. I mean,
this is a woman who, you know,

08:58.102 --> 09:02.019
she's heard about for years,
who occupied her desk,

09:02.063 --> 09:03.543
was in her exact same space.

09:03.586 --> 09:06.458
I mean, you gotta wonder,
after all these years,

09:06.502 --> 09:07.982
seeing all the hell
that Ziva's been through,

09:08.025 --> 09:09.766
that's got to leave
a pretty nasty mark.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.812
A mark that has Bishop
wondering if

09:11.855 --> 09:13.596
the same future awaits her.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.425
Yes. Yes.
That could totally be it.

09:16.468 --> 09:17.774
You are so good at this.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.820
Thank you. I try.

09:19.863 --> 09:21.604
Okay, but let's keep
going there.

09:21.648 --> 09:24.520
Why do you think
that she would--

09:24.564 --> 09:26.653
McGee.

09:26.696 --> 09:27.654
Hey.

09:27.697 --> 09:30.308
Hey, I was just, um...

09:30.352 --> 09:31.483
What's happening here?

09:31.527 --> 09:34.574
Well, actually...Nothing. Um...

09:36.706 --> 09:37.968
What's, uh, going on?

09:38.012 --> 09:41.189
Uh, well, we notified
our victim's brother.

09:41.232 --> 09:42.669
He's meeting us
at the trailer park.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.192
Great. Let's go.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.194
Hmm. Okay.

09:46.237 --> 09:47.804
To be continued.

09:49.850 --> 09:50.894
Hey...

09:52.417 --> 09:54.332
I had a feeling.

09:54.376 --> 09:55.682
What feeling?

09:55.725 --> 09:57.640
That you did
need to talk.

09:57.684 --> 09:58.989
What, that? No.
That was just...

09:59.033 --> 10:00.556
I just hope you're still
not mad at me.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.210
For what?

10:02.253 --> 10:04.386
For not saying anything
when Ziva reached out to me

10:04.429 --> 10:06.040
and not you.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.782
Bishop, that's not at all
what we talked about. Okay?

10:08.825 --> 10:10.392
I just had something else
I needed to clear up with Jack.

10:10.435 --> 10:13.003
Mm-hmm.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.526
BUCK: This can't
be happening.

10:14.570 --> 10:17.225
BISHOP: Again, Mr. Buck,
we're very sorry.

10:17.268 --> 10:18.661
When did you last
see your brother?

10:18.705 --> 10:20.881
A couple days ago.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.709
I thought he was headed
to the shore for some R&R.

10:22.752 --> 10:24.580
Otherwise I'd have
been worried.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.974
We talked most every day
since we bought this place.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.715
You own a mobile home here?

10:28.758 --> 10:30.542
Worse than that.

10:30.586 --> 10:31.979
We own the whole damn park.

10:32.022 --> 10:33.676
Who'd you buy it from?

10:33.720 --> 10:36.331
Nice old couple.
They retired to Florida

10:36.374 --> 10:37.724
a few months ago.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.682
Their place was right here.
We didn't want

10:39.726 --> 10:41.597
to live in it, so we

10:41.641 --> 10:43.817
found a buyer in Maryland and
shipped it out the other day.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.296
Why not live in it?

10:45.340 --> 10:47.864
Place I have is closer to
my job at the gas station.

10:47.908 --> 10:50.040
Eli should've moved in.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.173
It was his bright
idea to pool

10:52.216 --> 10:54.741
our life savings for
this great investment.

10:54.784 --> 10:57.091
Excuse me, gentlemen,
I...

10:57.134 --> 10:59.267
I couldn't help but hear
from my window.

10:59.310 --> 11:01.704
Did something happen
to Pete's brother?

11:01.748 --> 11:03.445
I'm afraid so.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.708
You-- You mean he's...?

11:05.752 --> 11:07.623
W-- Well, how?

11:07.667 --> 11:11.932
He was so young and seemed so
healthy the last time I saw him.

11:11.975 --> 11:14.369
And when was that?Ooh, it was just
the other day.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.545
[exhales] Oh.

11:16.588 --> 11:18.112
I swear...

11:18.155 --> 11:19.940
all this ugliness.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.463
There was no need
for it to happen.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.160
I'm sorry,
what ugliness?

11:23.204 --> 11:24.640
VINCE:
Yo, Pete!

11:24.684 --> 11:27.121
You and that brother
gonna jack up the rent,

11:27.164 --> 11:28.862
least you can do is hire
some damn security!

11:28.905 --> 11:30.646
[inhaling]

11:30.690 --> 11:31.952
It's bad enough

11:31.995 --> 11:33.780
I can't get a tomato
to grow this season.

11:33.823 --> 11:34.824
But somebody stole

11:34.868 --> 11:36.043
one of my gnomes!

11:37.218 --> 11:38.480
That's got to be
our crime scene.

11:38.523 --> 11:39.960
Hey, you're telling me.

11:40.003 --> 11:41.309
These little guys
have been

11:41.352 --> 11:43.877
guarding my crops
for so long.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.879
Man, what kind of
animal would do this?

11:45.922 --> 11:46.967
Hey, when did it
go missing?

11:47.010 --> 11:48.882
Its name is Felix.

11:48.925 --> 11:52.059
And Felix was stolen
about three days ago.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.408
You hear anything that night?

11:53.451 --> 11:54.844
Ah, not a peep.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.977
Between the Ambien and my
C-PAP, I don't hear much.

11:57.020 --> 12:00.328
This is definitely the spot.
Killer missed some pieces.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.851
Killer?

12:01.895 --> 12:05.507
Are you saying that...
that Eli's been murdered?

12:05.550 --> 12:07.335
That's what they're saying,
Esther.

12:07.378 --> 12:08.858
Eli your brother?

12:08.902 --> 12:10.207
ESTHER:
And-and you mean

12:10.251 --> 12:11.382
it happened here?

12:11.426 --> 12:13.036
Well, it's starting
to look that way.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.255
Got some drag
marks over here.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.041
TORRES:
Mm.

12:18.085 --> 12:20.609
So our guy got whacked
by Felix over there...

12:22.785 --> 12:25.222
Killer dragged his body to
the mobile home truck...

12:25.266 --> 12:26.789
How long was it
sitting there?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.008
Overnight.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.313
We loaded it Friday,

12:29.357 --> 12:30.532
driver took it Saturday morning.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.664
That's enough time
to stash a body.

12:32.708 --> 12:33.796
And you think someone
here did it?

12:33.840 --> 12:35.189
Can you think of
anyone else?

12:35.232 --> 12:37.234
No. People love Eli.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.932
Not your tenants.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.368
Only because of the rent.

12:40.411 --> 12:41.804
Yeah, what's that about?

12:41.848 --> 12:43.023
I thought these people
owned their homes.

12:43.066 --> 12:45.634
Yes, but not
the ground underneath.

12:45.677 --> 12:46.809
That, they rent from us.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.245
So how much you raise it?

12:48.289 --> 12:49.681
I okayed a minor bump,

12:49.725 --> 12:51.683
just to help spruce up
the place, but...

12:51.727 --> 12:54.295
then Eli got greedy
and nearly doubled it.

12:54.338 --> 12:56.427
Double?
Turned a bunch of

12:56.471 --> 12:59.604
happy neighbors into
an angry mob in no time.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.128
Listen: angry
mob or not,

13:01.171 --> 13:03.434
I can't imagine anyone here
would be capable

13:03.478 --> 13:05.132
of killing anyone.MAN: Hey, Vince.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.263
You out here?

13:06.307 --> 13:07.395
VINCE:
Check it out, Lou.

13:07.438 --> 13:08.570
You're not gonna
believe what happened.

13:11.268 --> 13:12.269
Or maybe you already know.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.373
NCIS!Stop!

13:29.417 --> 13:31.245
[grunts]

13:31.288 --> 13:33.290
Damn, why you chasing me, bro?

13:33.334 --> 13:36.206
Why you running, bro?[panting]

13:36.250 --> 13:37.817
I know why.

13:45.955 --> 13:49.480
Yep. [exhales]
That would be why.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.228
LOU: I just started
selling them last week.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.143
My job down at

14:00.187 --> 14:02.537
Big Box Emporium wasn't exactly
covering the rent.

14:02.580 --> 14:06.410
So you choose to sell
death machines instead.

14:06.454 --> 14:09.674
Eight AKs,
five rocket launchers,

14:09.718 --> 14:11.111
and whatever else.

14:11.154 --> 14:13.896
Supply meets demand, man.So when your

14:13.940 --> 14:16.333
new landlord finds out about

14:16.377 --> 14:18.335
your, uh,
little side business,

14:18.379 --> 14:19.902
you take him out?

14:19.946 --> 14:22.862
No way, man.
He never caught on.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.907
I mean, not that
I'd kill anybody anyway.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.953
I mean, you can check out
every single one of those guns.

14:26.996 --> 14:28.737
Not one of them's been fired.

14:28.780 --> 14:32.219
Apparently, he thinks
our victim was shot.

14:32.262 --> 14:35.352
That, or he wants us to think
he's thinking that. Apparently.

14:35.396 --> 14:36.919
LOU:
Look...

14:36.963 --> 14:39.922
everything was fine
till the old landlords left,

14:39.966 --> 14:42.055
and that slimy mobile home guru

14:42.098 --> 14:44.535
brought those brothers in
to buy the place.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.407
What guru?

14:46.450 --> 14:48.931
Goes by the name Mike Midas.

14:48.975 --> 14:51.238
Mike Midas.I'll take Torres.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.591
Another gold mine
you want to explore

14:56.634 --> 14:59.246
is something I call
Pervert Parks.

14:59.289 --> 15:01.335
These are
mobile home parks aimed

15:01.378 --> 15:02.945
exclusively at

15:02.989 --> 15:04.816
the registered
sex offender market.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.253
There's a market?

15:06.296 --> 15:08.342
Since no one else
wants them,

15:08.385 --> 15:09.952
these outcasts are a captive
revenue stream.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.955
Even more stuck than
your average mobile home owner.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.044
You can split one home
three ways

15:15.088 --> 15:16.698
and charge three separate rents,

15:16.741 --> 15:18.091
and they can never move out!

15:18.134 --> 15:19.440
[laughs]

15:19.483 --> 15:20.528
It's a thing of beauty!

15:20.571 --> 15:23.226
[chuckles]
It's so...

15:23.270 --> 15:26.621
just like the occasional break.
Let's take ten, people.

15:28.318 --> 15:30.799
Man. That's terrible.

15:30.842 --> 15:33.236
Eli and his brother
were prize pupils.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.108
They still own that
property in Sterling?

15:35.151 --> 15:37.197
That property
you advised them to buy.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.415
Oh, it was a
great opportunity.

15:38.459 --> 15:39.808
Play their cards right,

15:39.851 --> 15:41.984
place like that?
They'd be set for life.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.551
No perverts necessary?

15:43.594 --> 15:45.292
No, no, that would
just be greedy.

15:45.335 --> 15:47.424
Well, speaking of
jacked up rents,

15:47.468 --> 15:49.644
Would you consider them
doubling it to be,

15:49.687 --> 15:50.906
uh, playing their cards right?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.386
They doubled it?

15:52.429 --> 15:53.996
[chuckling] Well,
that's just crazy.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.043
You got to find the sweet spot
to keep your tenants paying

15:57.086 --> 15:58.827
and not able
to move out or sell.

15:58.870 --> 16:01.047
You shoot too high,
you end up with

16:01.090 --> 16:03.832
a lot full of empty,
worthless trailers.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.573
Or a bunch of
very angry tenants.

16:05.616 --> 16:09.011
Yeah. An increase like that
just doesn't make sense.

16:09.055 --> 16:12.014
Unless, of course...
you wantto fail!

16:12.058 --> 16:13.755
I cover that
this afternoon:

16:13.798 --> 16:16.018
"Bankruptcy Can Always Be
Your Friend."

16:16.062 --> 16:17.150
[chuckles]

16:17.193 --> 16:18.368
You guys want to come in?

16:20.196 --> 16:22.329
Oh, hey, Bishop.

16:22.372 --> 16:24.505
I hear we've
got a suspect.

16:24.548 --> 16:27.551
Uh, yeah, I mean, not
thesuspect just yet.

16:27.595 --> 16:28.944
So you're still busy?

16:28.988 --> 16:31.381
Uh, no. No more
than usual. Why?

16:31.425 --> 16:33.340
I guess I was hoping
you'd stop by.

16:33.383 --> 16:34.732
Are you sure you're doing okay?

16:34.776 --> 16:37.518
Why?
Did McGee say something?

16:37.561 --> 16:38.867
No. Not at all.

16:38.910 --> 16:41.348
It's just my own observation.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.437
Uh, maybe I'm
projecting,

16:43.480 --> 16:46.527
but your predecessor seemed
to cast a pretty tall shadow.

16:46.570 --> 16:50.966
Yeah. I mean, she still does,
Jack, but... so what?

16:51.010 --> 16:52.576
So nothing.

16:52.620 --> 16:55.710
I just want to be sure
that seeing where Ziva is today

16:55.753 --> 16:56.928
doesn't leave you
feeling like...

16:56.972 --> 16:58.756
I feel fine.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.410
I mean, sure,

17:00.454 --> 17:02.543
it was a little weird,

17:02.586 --> 17:05.894
and I'm still
processing, but no.

17:05.937 --> 17:09.028
Ziva and I, we're cool. Really.

17:09.071 --> 17:11.943
Well, good. That's good.
I'm glad.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.902
But...

17:13.945 --> 17:17.862
if you want to know
who's notcool...

17:17.906 --> 17:19.299
I think it's Nick.

17:19.342 --> 17:22.041
Huh. What-What's going on
with him?

17:22.084 --> 17:25.000
Well, Ziva beat him
in a fight,

17:25.044 --> 17:27.350
and it was a fake fight

17:27.394 --> 17:29.265
used as a distraction,
but I saw it up close,

17:29.309 --> 17:31.224
and it got real.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.313
I can't imagine
he took that well.

17:33.356 --> 17:36.185
Nick, losing?
No. I mean,

17:36.229 --> 17:37.926
he hasn't really
been the same since.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.884
He's been, like, distracted,

17:39.928 --> 17:42.583
irritated,
and when we do talk,

17:42.626 --> 17:44.454
he won't look me in the eye.

17:44.498 --> 17:45.629
[phone ringing]

17:45.673 --> 17:46.761
Oh. It's Gibbs.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.415
Hey. Gibbs, what's up?

17:48.458 --> 17:49.633
GIBBS:
Where are you?

17:49.677 --> 17:52.114
I'm just... here.
Talking to Jack.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.595
You should try it
sometime, Gibbs.

17:55.509 --> 17:57.032
Or not.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.338
Uh, what's up?

17:58.381 --> 18:00.209
Meet me in the conference room.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.428
You heard him.

18:01.471 --> 18:04.126
To be continued.You know, that is what

18:04.170 --> 18:07.347
you said to McGee, but I'm just
telling you, it's Nick.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.088
He's the one.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.745
PETE:
Agent Gibbs?
I got to know.

18:14.789 --> 18:17.139
Did Lou kill my brother?

18:17.183 --> 18:18.488
We haven't ruled it out.

18:18.532 --> 18:20.142
We're charging him with
illegal firearms

18:20.186 --> 18:21.274
just the same.

18:21.317 --> 18:22.449
GIBBS:
Your tenants...

18:22.492 --> 18:23.972
any reason you and Eli

18:24.015 --> 18:25.626
wantedthem to move out?

18:25.669 --> 18:28.237
You mean on purpose? Why?

18:28.281 --> 18:29.760
Bankruptcy.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.284
What? N--

18:31.327 --> 18:32.633
No.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.635
What would even
give you that idea?
Midas.

18:34.678 --> 18:37.464
[chuckles]
You talked to that parasite?

18:37.507 --> 18:39.466
Selling us on easy money
while neglecting

18:39.509 --> 18:40.684
to mention
all the pissed-off tenants

18:40.728 --> 18:42.121
who'd be wanting to kill us?

18:42.164 --> 18:43.818
We've interviewed
every tenant, Pete.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.994
We still have no leads.No leads?

18:46.037 --> 18:49.824
You want leads?
I got a lead for you right here.

18:49.867 --> 18:52.000
Just found that
on my windshield.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.698
And you think that's
from one of your tenants?It's got to be.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.439
After you took Lou
away, they all

18:56.483 --> 18:58.833
huddled up
in their ringleader's trailer.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.487
Whose trailer?

19:00.530 --> 19:02.228
What ringleader?

19:03.229 --> 19:05.056
GIBBS: So you know
nothing about it?

19:05.100 --> 19:06.884
I don't write notes

19:06.928 --> 19:08.451
or make threats.

19:08.495 --> 19:09.887
I say what I'm thinking.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.846
Yes, ma'am.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.500
And as for any
tenants' meeting,

19:13.543 --> 19:15.284
so what?

19:15.328 --> 19:17.678
Good neighbors come together

19:17.721 --> 19:20.202
in troubling times.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.986
[chuckles]

19:22.030 --> 19:24.815
I've known
most of these folks forever.

19:24.859 --> 19:25.816
GIBBS:
How long's that?

19:25.860 --> 19:27.470
It's going on 20 years.

19:27.514 --> 19:31.648
It was right after, uh,
my Walter died.

19:31.692 --> 19:32.867
His pension

19:32.910 --> 19:35.304
paid for this
place, covered

19:35.348 --> 19:36.827
all 40,000.

19:36.871 --> 19:40.744
Course, it ain't worth
a dime now.

19:40.788 --> 19:42.746
Why?
It's a nice place.

19:42.790 --> 19:44.357
Yeah, like a nice

19:44.400 --> 19:47.795
used car with, uh,
too many miles on it. [chuckles]

19:47.838 --> 19:48.926
I can't sell it.

19:48.970 --> 19:50.450
Can't move it.

19:50.493 --> 19:53.844
Most of us here,
we all live on

19:53.888 --> 19:55.759
a fixed income.

19:55.803 --> 19:56.934
So, yeah.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.763
We got together and we talked

19:59.807 --> 20:02.070
about making Pete

20:02.113 --> 20:03.811
a counteroffer.

20:03.854 --> 20:05.378
You don't waste time.

20:05.421 --> 20:08.816
Well, there's no time to waste.

20:08.859 --> 20:10.339
Or I'm on the street.

20:10.383 --> 20:12.907
All I've got left
is, uh,

20:12.950 --> 20:15.126
this home.

20:15.170 --> 20:17.085
And my paintings, hmm?

20:17.128 --> 20:19.696
Well, my plan is to
sell them all at the

20:19.740 --> 20:22.438
County Arts Fair, leave
the money to my grandkids

20:22.482 --> 20:23.700
when I die.

20:23.744 --> 20:27.617
I don't know.
If it were me...

20:27.661 --> 20:30.272
I'd rather have a painting.Well, that's very

20:30.316 --> 20:32.231
sweet of you to say,

20:32.274 --> 20:34.233
but, uh, I'd feel better knowing

20:34.276 --> 20:37.975
that I helped pay
for something useful,

20:38.019 --> 20:40.456
so that they never end up
like this.

20:46.375 --> 20:49.291
Hey, Nick.
Just the man I wanted to see.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.206
Wow. This is what it's come to?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.208
No one comes by
to talk,

20:53.252 --> 20:55.166
so you have to resort
to stalking us in the hallway?

20:55.210 --> 20:58.344
I'll have you know that
you're my last holdout,

20:58.387 --> 20:59.693
thank you very much.

20:59.736 --> 21:01.260
And Gibbs, of course,

21:01.303 --> 21:03.131
but, uh, we all know
that's a long shot, so...

21:03.174 --> 21:05.873
So McGee and Bishop,
they're pretty messed up, huh?

21:05.916 --> 21:07.353
Yeah.

21:07.396 --> 21:09.355
They had a bigger connection
to Ziva than I did.

21:13.184 --> 21:16.318
But... is that
still true?

21:18.668 --> 21:21.280
What?
You and Ziva.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.804
I-I know you didn't have
a connection before,

21:23.847 --> 21:27.111
but I heard that might have
changed a little bit,

21:27.155 --> 21:28.330
you know what I mean?

21:28.374 --> 21:31.159
Wow. Bishop told you?

21:31.202 --> 21:33.814
She didn't have to.
Word gets around.

21:33.857 --> 21:35.468
And I know how
you hate to lose,

21:35.511 --> 21:37.905
so that must've been
a bitter pill, Nick.

21:37.948 --> 21:40.951
[scoffs] All right.

21:40.995 --> 21:43.998
Jack.

21:44.041 --> 21:47.001
I didn't lose. I let Ziva win.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.568
Okay.

21:48.611 --> 21:50.657
Don't get me wrong,
she's a tough girl,

21:50.700 --> 21:52.485
but I had her right
where I wanted her

21:52.528 --> 21:54.356
until she distracted me.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.836
How'd she do that?

21:55.879 --> 21:58.969
She knew what to say
just to throw me off my game.

21:59.013 --> 22:00.580
Really? What?

22:00.623 --> 22:03.278
She said, um...

22:03.322 --> 22:06.194
Okay. [chuckles]

22:06.237 --> 22:07.587
It was personal.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.023
I'm not talking
about it.

22:09.066 --> 22:10.851
Oh, come on, Nick.

22:10.894 --> 22:13.549
Okay, why are you even wasting
your time with me, or any of us?

22:13.593 --> 22:16.247
I mean, we all know who's more
messed up about the Ziva thing.

22:16.291 --> 22:17.510
Who?

22:17.553 --> 22:20.034
Who? Oh, you know who.

22:20.077 --> 22:22.515
You know even better
than anybody,

22:22.558 --> 22:26.040
since, uh, Gibbs and you
are so, uh, tight.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.129
What? Me and Gibbs?

22:28.172 --> 22:30.610
Hey, don't get shy.
Don't get shy.

22:30.653 --> 22:32.307
It's okay. We all know
you have a thing.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.048
What thing?

22:34.091 --> 22:35.528
Hey, it's cool.

22:35.571 --> 22:38.269
Whatever happens off duty
is your business.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.315
Oh...
No, wait, wait,
wait, back up.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.925
Sorry.
Back up.

22:41.969 --> 22:44.406
Gibbs.

22:44.450 --> 22:47.235
Yup. Be right there.

22:47.278 --> 22:49.411
Duty calls.

22:49.455 --> 22:51.805
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Not yet.

22:51.848 --> 22:54.155
Not yet.

22:54.198 --> 22:57.158
Why does everybody have the idea

22:57.201 --> 22:59.465
that Gibbs and I have a thing?

22:59.508 --> 23:01.902
Christmas.

23:01.945 --> 23:03.730
Jack, last Christmas?

23:03.773 --> 23:06.297
When we went to drop off
the baby to his new parents?

23:08.038 --> 23:09.823
It sure looked like
you were more than friends.

23:09.866 --> 23:12.303
But Christmas was so long ago.

23:23.663 --> 23:25.578
[groans]

23:28.189 --> 23:30.626
[indistinct shouting]

23:30.670 --> 23:32.454
Hey.

23:32.498 --> 23:35.239
Gibbs and McGee are in traffic.
They're right behind us.

23:35.283 --> 23:36.719
I let Ziva win.

23:38.373 --> 23:39.330
What?

23:39.374 --> 23:41.768
You heard what I said.

23:41.811 --> 23:44.553
Uh, okay.

23:44.597 --> 23:45.815
Whoa.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.079
What the...?

23:49.123 --> 23:51.342
PETE: I got out
just in time.

23:51.386 --> 23:52.692
[coughing]

24:04.530 --> 24:06.270
KASIE: The good news is
that charcoal pencil

24:06.314 --> 24:07.576
you took from
that old woman

24:07.620 --> 24:09.404
does not match the pencil

24:09.448 --> 24:11.145
that was used on
the death threat note.

24:11.188 --> 24:12.189
What about the bomb?

24:12.233 --> 24:13.495
That's the weird news.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.018
Based on what's left
of Pete's car,

24:15.062 --> 24:17.064
I can tell you
it wasn't a bomb at all.

24:17.107 --> 24:19.066
Not the classic
turn the key and then...

24:19.109 --> 24:20.850
[imitates explosion]
...kind of bomb, at least.

24:20.894 --> 24:23.636
What was it?Uh, more a

24:23.679 --> 24:26.073
"throw the Molotov
and then run" type deal.

24:26.116 --> 24:28.336
Broken bottle
plus gasoline

24:28.379 --> 24:30.686
means someone likely
tossed it under his car.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.471
Amateur hour.
Maybe,

24:32.514 --> 24:36.257
but sometimes low budget can be
even scarier, like Leprechaun 2.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.346
Anything else, Kase?

24:38.389 --> 24:40.043
Uh, still waiting on Mass Spec

24:40.087 --> 24:41.523
to digest all those
gnome pieces.

24:41.567 --> 24:42.829
I should know something soon.

24:42.872 --> 24:44.700
Later, guys.See you.

24:44.744 --> 24:45.788
Yeah.TORRES: Later.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.272
What do you need, Jack?

24:51.315 --> 24:54.449
Uh, nothing.
Just seeing if I can help

24:54.493 --> 24:57.583
with the... case, anything.

24:57.626 --> 24:59.236
Oh, I'd say
you've done enough.

25:00.237 --> 25:02.283
Then again, so have you, McGee.

25:02.326 --> 25:03.719
I didn't say anything.

25:03.763 --> 25:05.199
You're one to talk, Ellie.

25:05.242 --> 25:07.070
Wh... Excuse me?

25:07.114 --> 25:09.203
Stop.
I let Ziva win.

25:09.246 --> 25:10.900
Will you stop!?

25:10.944 --> 25:13.294
Did you not
hear Kasie?

25:13.337 --> 25:16.819
Molotov car bombs. Keep digging.

25:16.863 --> 25:18.908
Go. Go.

25:20.170 --> 25:23.217
Duck?
Jethro. Yes. Uh,

25:23.260 --> 25:25.045
I, too,
have been digging,

25:25.088 --> 25:26.829
running the names
of the tenants

25:26.873 --> 25:29.615
through databases
from several agencies.

25:29.658 --> 25:31.268
You found something.

25:31.312 --> 25:34.663
Yeah, a sealed record
from the FBI.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.926
What name is it?

25:36.970 --> 25:40.887
So Vincent Pierman
of Sterling, Virginia

25:40.930 --> 25:43.150
is actually Vicenzo Palumbo
of Yonkers, New York.

25:43.193 --> 25:46.719
I haven't been
back there in years.

25:46.762 --> 25:49.678
Yeah, not since 2005,
when you turned state's evidence

25:49.722 --> 25:52.899
against fellow members
of the Pittorino crime family.

25:52.942 --> 25:56.424
Man's got to do, you know?

25:58.687 --> 26:00.341
What about your code?

26:00.384 --> 26:01.951
Don't guys like you have a thing

26:01.995 --> 26:03.431
about never ratting
your friends out?

26:03.474 --> 26:04.737
It's only
in the movies.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.347
There's also
a fine line

26:06.390 --> 26:08.392
between ratting out your friends

26:08.436 --> 26:09.785
and merely wanting to help them.

26:09.829 --> 26:11.961
Yeah, maybe they
don't need your help.

26:14.311 --> 26:15.922
You two want to be alone?

26:15.965 --> 26:17.140
All right, Vince,

26:17.184 --> 26:18.489
let's talk about Eli.

26:18.533 --> 26:20.622
First, you should know

26:20.666 --> 26:23.146
I really do love my gnomes.

26:23.190 --> 26:25.496
So Felix is
the last thing

26:25.540 --> 26:27.977
I'd be cracking any
melons with, believe me.

26:28.021 --> 26:31.154
I was always more
of a knife guy anyway.

26:31.198 --> 26:34.810
But surely you wanted to crack
Eli's melon at some point.

26:34.854 --> 26:38.640
In my younger days,
I would have.

26:38.684 --> 26:41.991
But look at me now.
I can't hardly breathe,

26:42.035 --> 26:45.647
I can't grow a tomato,
and I live in a fancy box.

26:45.691 --> 26:48.781
After all this time
in the witness protection,

26:48.824 --> 26:51.348
never in a million years

26:51.392 --> 26:53.612
would I want to draw
that kind of attention.

26:53.655 --> 26:56.658
He does makes a rather
compelling argument.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.007
VINCE:
Last thing I need

26:58.051 --> 27:00.140
is any of my old crowd
finding me.

27:01.184 --> 27:05.145
By the way,
I couldn't help noticing

27:05.188 --> 27:07.321
a palpable tension
between you

27:07.364 --> 27:08.844
and Agent Sloane.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.585
Yeah, so?

27:10.629 --> 27:12.631
Well, I was wondering
if it had anything to do

27:12.674 --> 27:15.024
with the visit
she paid me earlier.

27:15.068 --> 27:16.939
She got to you, too?
The Ziva talk?

27:16.983 --> 27:19.638
No, actually,
it was more about you.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.204
Me?

27:21.248 --> 27:24.120
Inquiring about
your mental state.

27:24.164 --> 27:25.948
Why not ask me
directly?

27:25.992 --> 27:28.037
Well, that's p-precisely
what I told her,

27:28.081 --> 27:31.867
with a warning not to expect
much of an answer,

27:31.911 --> 27:33.564
if any.

27:33.608 --> 27:37.438
Sure, I hate those brothers,

27:37.481 --> 27:39.570
but I can't afford
to move.

27:39.614 --> 27:42.269
[wheezing]

27:45.098 --> 27:47.448
You need some water? Hey.

27:55.630 --> 27:57.066
How long have you had
the asthma?

27:57.110 --> 28:00.156
It's never been
this bad.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.115
Last few months,
it's gotten way worse.

28:02.158 --> 28:04.595
Just like your tomato crop.

28:04.639 --> 28:07.642
Oh. Come to think of it, yeah.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.905
I mean, I used to grow them
like bowling balls,

28:09.949 --> 28:11.690
and now I barely get weeds.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.779
Even the bugs don't even
bother coming around.

28:13.822 --> 28:15.911
JIMMY:
I know that look.

28:15.955 --> 28:17.130
What look?

28:17.173 --> 28:18.697
Not you.
You just keep breathing.

28:20.307 --> 28:22.048
So what're you thinking?

28:22.091 --> 28:24.137
Right. You're thinking,
"What am I thinking?"

28:24.180 --> 28:26.095
I was just telling Sloane,

28:26.139 --> 28:28.707
if you ever want to know
what's on Gibbs' mind...Sloane was here?

28:28.750 --> 28:30.360
Yeah, right before
you came down.

28:36.976 --> 28:39.761
Hey.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.502
What are you up to, exactly?

28:41.545 --> 28:43.069
Excuse me?

28:43.112 --> 28:45.375
Vance wants you to make sure
that the team is okay.

28:45.419 --> 28:48.074
Yeah, okay. Good. I got that.

28:48.117 --> 28:50.598
Yeah, so what don't you get?

28:50.641 --> 28:53.166
Why are you asking about me?

28:53.209 --> 28:57.779
Hey, listen, when I can't
get you to speak for yourself,

28:57.823 --> 29:01.435
yeah, sometimes I'm forced
to ask others.

29:01.478 --> 29:04.960
Talking is part
of my job, Gibbs.

29:05.004 --> 29:07.615
Hmm.
And I...

29:07.658 --> 29:10.313
I like to talk, and

29:10.357 --> 29:12.446
I'd actually like to talk more

29:12.489 --> 29:15.492
with you.

29:15.536 --> 29:16.929
About what?

29:16.972 --> 29:19.322
You know damn well.No, I don't.

29:19.366 --> 29:21.455
I really don't.

29:21.498 --> 29:24.327
God, it's-it's the elephant
in the room.

29:24.371 --> 29:25.807
What elephant?

29:27.548 --> 29:29.376
That?
That an elephant now?

29:29.419 --> 29:31.160
I thought that
was a moth.

29:31.204 --> 29:33.554
It is what you want it to be.Well,

29:33.597 --> 29:35.817
what I want it
to be is gone.

29:35.861 --> 29:37.297
It's been here
since you got here.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.168
Don't change the subject.

29:39.212 --> 29:42.128
I am talking about

29:42.171 --> 29:44.870
you and...

29:46.393 --> 29:49.962
...Ziva. You and Ziva.

29:50.005 --> 29:52.747
What about it?
There's nothing to say.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.619
We both know that's not true.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.667
Come on.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.147
Jack, what did she expect?

30:01.190 --> 30:03.671
I mean, she let us all think
that she was dead, okay?

30:03.714 --> 30:07.066
Yes. Right.

30:08.458 --> 30:11.070
And that
must've hurt.

30:11.113 --> 30:14.029
I mean, she was
like a daughter to you.

30:14.073 --> 30:18.207
And, my God, then having her
come back from the dead.

30:18.251 --> 30:20.166
I can't imagine
what that did to you.

30:20.209 --> 30:23.386
And then she leaves again.

30:28.783 --> 30:32.395
Yeah. Okay.

30:32.439 --> 30:35.877
It bothered me,
but I get it.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.836
Uh...

30:39.925 --> 30:41.578
I should've looked for her.

30:41.622 --> 30:43.885
So why didn't you?

30:43.929 --> 30:45.887
Because she was dead.

30:45.931 --> 30:47.889
Done deal.

30:50.065 --> 30:52.807
I still should've looked
to make sure.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.417
Trust but verify.

30:54.461 --> 30:56.115
Well, yeah, and
I didn't do that, so...

30:58.944 --> 31:01.076
...made a mistake.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.818
Like we all do.

31:03.862 --> 31:07.430
But what does she want
from me, Jack?

31:07.474 --> 31:09.824
She's gone again.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.870
Does that mean I'm supposed to
be out there looking for her?

31:11.913 --> 31:13.741
I mean, what does she
expect from me?

31:13.784 --> 31:17.092
Uh, I don't know.
That's every parent's conundrum:

31:17.136 --> 31:18.789
What if they need me?

31:18.833 --> 31:20.661
Yeah, well, what if
she does need me?

31:20.704 --> 31:23.838
What if she needs me now?
What do I do?

31:23.882 --> 31:26.536
Well...
Jack.

31:26.580 --> 31:29.452
What would you do? Tell me.

31:29.496 --> 31:32.064
Professionally speaking,

31:32.107 --> 31:34.414
it's not about what I would do,

31:34.457 --> 31:37.417
but as a friend,

31:37.460 --> 31:41.508
a friend who knows a thing or
two about letting a daughter go,

31:41.551 --> 31:45.425
I'd say you've done
all you could,

31:45.468 --> 31:49.168
and now you need
to let her go, again.

31:50.212 --> 31:52.606
[cell phone ringing]

31:55.174 --> 31:57.741
Hey, Kasie, I'm on my way.

31:57.785 --> 31:59.961
Uh, but then you'll
come back?

32:00.005 --> 32:01.832
No. No, I'm done.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.399
Uh, you sure?

32:03.443 --> 32:04.705
Yeah, I'm sure.

32:04.748 --> 32:07.534
Uh... thanks.

32:07.577 --> 32:08.970
It helped.

32:10.276 --> 32:13.192
Unless there's something else.

32:14.628 --> 32:16.978
Really.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.850
Is there anything
you need, Jack?

32:19.894 --> 32:22.027
Uh...

32:24.725 --> 32:26.553
Anything you want
to talk about?

32:29.904 --> 32:31.645
Uh, later, maybe.

32:31.688 --> 32:33.995
We can talk later.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.128
Okay.

32:41.916 --> 32:43.483
Or not.

32:45.137 --> 32:47.095
Kase, I could use
some good news.

32:47.139 --> 32:50.707
Well, I can't
call it good exactly,

32:50.751 --> 32:52.013
unless you like surprises.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.101
Try me.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.712
Results from
the gnome pieces

32:55.756 --> 32:57.801
and soil samples.
They test positive

32:57.845 --> 33:00.195
for several
toxic carcinogens.

33:00.239 --> 33:02.023
Chemicals.

33:02.067 --> 33:04.025
You may recall,
back in the 1970s,

33:04.069 --> 33:06.723
a place near Niagara Falls
called Love Canal?

33:06.767 --> 33:09.030
Yeah, built on a chemical dump.

33:09.074 --> 33:11.598
On a cocktail of toxicity
leeched though their soil

33:11.641 --> 33:13.556
from a chemical
company nearby,

33:13.600 --> 33:16.907
which caused leukemia
and other horrible things.

33:16.951 --> 33:17.952
It's as bad as that?

33:17.996 --> 33:20.389
That bad and getting worse.

33:20.433 --> 33:23.305
Happy Trails Mobile Home Park
is a death trap.

33:23.349 --> 33:25.220
Any chance our victim knew it?

33:25.264 --> 33:27.222
If he did, there's
an even better chance

33:27.266 --> 33:28.658
it's what got him killed.

33:37.406 --> 33:38.581
Toxic chemicals.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.366
We got anything?

33:40.409 --> 33:41.541
Uh, ugly stuff.
I mean, one of these

33:41.584 --> 33:43.456
was outright banned
until recently,

33:43.499 --> 33:45.893
causing increased birth defects,
respiratory problems.

33:45.936 --> 33:48.200
We know how it got
in the soil?Uh, not yet.

33:48.243 --> 33:51.594
Actually, boss, I traced 'em all
to a Zullow Chemical.

33:51.638 --> 33:53.901
A company that specializes
in pesticides.

33:53.944 --> 33:57.252
Headquarters is about 12 miles
away from our trailer park.

33:57.296 --> 33:59.298
And you're only
telling us this now?

33:59.341 --> 34:00.995
Why I didn't tell you before,

34:01.039 --> 34:02.388
because you're still not
talking to me.

34:02.431 --> 34:03.650
TORRES: I am talking
to you, McGee.

34:03.693 --> 34:05.217
I'm just not talking to her.

34:05.260 --> 34:06.783
Focus.

34:06.827 --> 34:08.002
12 miles.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.438
Long way for chemicals
to travel.

34:09.482 --> 34:11.136
Mm, not really.

34:11.179 --> 34:14.139
Groundwater can carry them
a lot further than that.

34:14.182 --> 34:15.792
Zullow. Zullow.

34:15.836 --> 34:17.838
Why-why does that
ring a bell?

34:17.881 --> 34:19.448
Something about a fire.

34:22.538 --> 34:24.671
"Zullow Industries."What industry are they in?

34:24.714 --> 34:26.803
It doesn't say, but they have
a warehouse in Sterling.

34:26.847 --> 34:28.675
Same town as our
trailer park bust.

34:28.718 --> 34:31.286
TORRES: According to this, they
had a major accident last year.

34:31.330 --> 34:33.593
The whole place
caught on fire.

34:33.636 --> 34:35.334
I wonder what
they were warehousing.

34:35.377 --> 34:37.205
Well, let's find out.

34:37.249 --> 34:38.902
Gibbs, I'm not sure
it's gonna be that simple.

34:38.946 --> 34:41.166
McGEE:
Uh, yeah, boss.

34:41.209 --> 34:42.428
These companies don't really
just offer this information

34:42.471 --> 34:43.994
'cause we ask.

34:44.038 --> 34:46.171
Yeah, and science isn't exactly
in our wheelhouse.

34:49.870 --> 34:52.046
I do like a good charade.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.526
It's not much
of a charade, Duck.

34:53.569 --> 34:54.788
Just putting 'em
at ease.

34:56.355 --> 34:58.052
Just a reminder,
gentlemen,

34:58.096 --> 34:59.227
Mr. Rama's made
this time available

34:59.271 --> 35:00.620
as a courtesy, so...

35:00.663 --> 35:02.448
Oh, Sara, no need
to rush our guests.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.841
Lance Rama, Senior V.P.

35:04.885 --> 35:06.800
Uh, Donald Mallard.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.236
And this is Agent Gibbs.Hey.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.629
I'm just the guy
driving the car.

35:09.672 --> 35:12.327
He's here to say
all the big words.[Rama laughs]

35:12.371 --> 35:14.416
That's pretty much our
in-house attorney's job, too.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.505
Oh, yeah? Let them
duke it out.

35:16.549 --> 35:18.507
You and me, we'll
go have a beer.

35:18.551 --> 35:19.682
Now you're talking.

35:19.726 --> 35:22.642
What are we
"duking out," exactly?

35:22.685 --> 35:24.992
No duking necessary.

35:25.035 --> 35:27.690
Just a few questions
about your warehouse

35:27.734 --> 35:31.172
in Sterling, which was
the apparent scene

35:31.216 --> 35:32.652
of a fire last year.

35:32.695 --> 35:36.873
If you could just confirm

35:36.917 --> 35:39.049
the chemicals
that you stored there.

35:39.093 --> 35:42.836
That's hardly information we're
obligated to divulge without...

35:42.879 --> 35:45.491
DUCKY: Specifically,
three fumigants.

35:45.534 --> 35:47.623
Hydrogen cyanide,

35:47.667 --> 35:49.973
naphthalene,
and chlorpyrifos.

35:50.017 --> 35:51.366
GIBBS:
You see?

35:51.410 --> 35:53.499
Better him than me.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.979
[chuckles]
Can you confirm?

35:56.023 --> 35:59.809
Uh, yes. Uh...

35:59.853 --> 36:01.071
those are ingredients
in one of our

36:01.115 --> 36:02.812
most popular insecticides.

36:02.856 --> 36:06.338
And approximately
what quantity leaked

36:06.381 --> 36:08.035
from the warehouse?

36:08.078 --> 36:10.298
ATTORNEY: Well, if you check
the record, you'll see

36:10.342 --> 36:12.866
that fire damage was kept
to a minimum, so...

36:12.909 --> 36:15.260
Not what he asked.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.048
Look, gentlemen, I'm not sure
where this is going, but...

36:21.091 --> 36:22.441
It's going to a trailer park

36:22.484 --> 36:24.443
and the soil that you poisoned.

36:26.009 --> 36:28.925
Now, you gonna tell the tenants,

36:28.969 --> 36:30.753
or you want us to do that?

36:30.797 --> 36:32.233
Or the EPA.

36:32.277 --> 36:35.323
Uh... [chuckles]
There's no need for that.

36:35.367 --> 36:38.544
We're aware of the issue,
and I assure you

36:38.587 --> 36:40.415
that it's being handled
internally.

36:40.459 --> 36:43.201
By Eli and Pete Buck.

36:43.244 --> 36:44.550
GIBBS: How much
you have to pay them

36:44.593 --> 36:47.030
to handle your issues
internally?

36:48.075 --> 36:49.337
What do you mean?

36:49.381 --> 36:53.515
We mean that perhaps
you financed the brothers

36:53.559 --> 36:55.909
to buy the trailer park
on your behalf,

36:55.952 --> 36:58.041
and get rid of the tenants

36:58.085 --> 36:59.521
before they caught on.

36:59.565 --> 37:00.870
And then they raise the rents,

37:00.914 --> 37:02.220
and the tenants move out
on their own.

37:02.263 --> 37:04.396
Keeping your hands clean
and you free

37:04.439 --> 37:06.920
from potential lawsuits.No.

37:06.963 --> 37:08.748
Lance, I would
strongly advise...

37:08.791 --> 37:10.750
I can't let them
paint it this way.

37:10.793 --> 37:12.317
Paint it what way?

37:12.360 --> 37:15.494
[sighs] We would never
force people out.

37:15.537 --> 37:19.585
Yes, we contracted the brothers
to buy the park, but...

37:19.628 --> 37:23.763
to also dole out some very
generous incentive packages

37:23.806 --> 37:25.852
to cover the tenants'
inconvenience.

37:25.895 --> 37:28.420
Incentive packages?

37:30.160 --> 37:32.598
The tenants never got 'em.

37:32.641 --> 37:35.383
What's this about?
You have another suspect?

37:35.427 --> 37:38.778
We do.
Zullow Chemical.

37:38.821 --> 37:41.433
McGEE: They gave you and Eli
half a million dollars

37:41.476 --> 37:44.349
to buy the trailer park
and pay the tenants to leave.

37:44.392 --> 37:47.308
BISHOP: But, as you said before,
Eli was greedy,

37:47.352 --> 37:50.398
came up with a better plan
to keep all the money and just

37:50.442 --> 37:52.574
raise the rent
to force them out.

37:52.618 --> 37:56.317
And maybe you got cold feet.

37:59.407 --> 38:03.150
No. That's not it.

38:03.193 --> 38:05.326
Then what?

38:05.370 --> 38:07.633
[shudders]

38:07.676 --> 38:09.112
You got it backward.

38:10.723 --> 38:14.466
It was me.

38:14.509 --> 38:15.902
All of it.

38:15.945 --> 38:19.471
I'm the one who pushed him
into the Zullow deal.

38:19.514 --> 38:22.604
You put Eli under that truck?

38:24.432 --> 38:28.828
After we loaded it,
his conscience kicked in.

38:28.871 --> 38:31.221
He wanted to kill the deal.

38:33.223 --> 38:36.401
Tell the tenants,
blow the whistle. [sniffles]

38:36.444 --> 38:38.881
And you couldn't
let him do that.

38:38.925 --> 38:41.362
It was just a fight.

38:41.406 --> 38:44.409
Words, shoves...

38:44.452 --> 38:46.585
[sighs]

38:46.628 --> 38:49.675
Until he fell...

38:49.718 --> 38:52.678
right on that stupid
garden thing.

38:52.721 --> 38:55.245
Most people would call 911.

38:56.943 --> 38:59.685
I started to.

38:59.728 --> 39:02.905
But I'm still
pumping gas at 35.

39:02.949 --> 39:07.388
Did I have to lose a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?

39:07.432 --> 39:10.783
So your car.
That was you, too?

39:10.826 --> 39:13.960
You started clearing suspects.

39:14.003 --> 39:17.398
I had to do something.

39:17.442 --> 39:20.009
So I wrote the note and...

39:20.053 --> 39:23.143
s-set the fire.

39:25.406 --> 39:26.929
[crying]

39:26.973 --> 39:28.017
Oh...

39:28.061 --> 39:31.325
Eli, I'm sorry.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.676
[sobbing]
What did I do?

39:34.720 --> 39:38.245
That's so sad.
It's simply tragic.

39:38.288 --> 39:40.813
At least you know it wasn't
one of your neighbors.

39:40.856 --> 39:42.423
Well, that I was sure of.

39:42.467 --> 39:45.165
Oh, God,
what does it matter?

39:45.208 --> 39:49.387
We're living on toxic land.

39:49.430 --> 39:51.867
And what do we do now?
[grunts]

39:51.911 --> 39:54.304
Give this number a call.

39:54.348 --> 39:56.742
A lawyer friend of ours.
Good people.

39:56.785 --> 39:59.484
I gave her the details.
She's expecting your call.

39:59.527 --> 40:01.921
My call about what?

40:01.964 --> 40:04.402
Esther, you're the ringleader.

40:04.445 --> 40:07.883
Tell the others they have
one hell of a settlement

40:07.927 --> 40:10.059
waiting for them.

40:10.103 --> 40:12.322
Something you can leave
your grandkids.

40:12.366 --> 40:14.368
[crying]

40:16.152 --> 40:19.939
I wish there was some way
I could thank you.

40:19.982 --> 40:20.983
It's okay.

40:22.332 --> 40:24.944
Thank you, thank you.[laughs] Okay.

40:24.987 --> 40:26.598
[laughs]

40:29.601 --> 40:31.385
Hey.

40:32.342 --> 40:34.519
Nice work, you
very special agents.

40:34.562 --> 40:36.303
And she's back.

40:36.346 --> 40:39.785
You got, uh, some more
evaluating to do?

40:39.828 --> 40:41.526
Yeah, Jack,
our morale is just fine.

40:41.569 --> 40:45.094
Hey, enough already, okay?

40:45.138 --> 40:46.879
Vance gave me
a job to do,

40:46.922 --> 40:48.446
and if it rattled
your cages,

40:48.489 --> 40:50.752
I'm sorry,
but it sure as hell seems like

40:50.796 --> 40:51.971
they needed some rattling.

40:53.233 --> 40:54.756
Am I wrong?

40:54.800 --> 40:57.237
No, you are not wrong.

40:57.280 --> 41:00.501
Okay, maybe our chemistry
was a little off.

41:00.545 --> 41:02.764
Yeah. Maybe.

41:02.808 --> 41:05.767
Okay. So, what next?

41:05.811 --> 41:08.988
Who would like to hop on
the apology train? Anyone?

41:09.031 --> 41:10.206
[sighs]

41:12.426 --> 41:14.210
Ellie, I'm sorry
I said anything.

41:14.254 --> 41:16.691
I was-- I was
just trying to help.

41:16.735 --> 41:19.477
I know. Thanks for trying.

41:20.565 --> 41:21.827
Same here, Nick.

41:21.870 --> 41:25.178
I was only trying to help.

41:25.221 --> 41:27.223
I should have come to you.

41:27.267 --> 41:29.704
Okay. But I let Ziva win.

41:29.748 --> 41:33.360
Which is very clear
to me now.

41:33.403 --> 41:35.536
Uh, and what about Gibbs?

41:35.580 --> 41:36.711
Where is he?

41:38.583 --> 41:41.499
Oh, come on, you must know.

41:41.542 --> 41:44.023
I think he's still
at the trailer park.

41:44.066 --> 41:47.156
Great. In that case...
[clears throat]

41:47.200 --> 41:50.856
...let me take this opportunity
to make something very clear.

41:50.899 --> 41:55.121
Gibbs and I are not
having a thing.

41:56.688 --> 41:58.037
Okay, but...

41:58.080 --> 42:00.256
Who said that you were?

42:00.300 --> 42:02.694
TORRES:
Oh, okay, um...

42:02.737 --> 42:04.434
I guess it was only me.

42:07.263 --> 42:08.308
Okay.

42:08.351 --> 42:09.527
Good night.

42:09.570 --> 42:11.529
Good night.
Night.
Later.

42:14.357 --> 42:16.098
Way to throw me under
the bus there, guys.

42:16.142 --> 42:18.318
I mean, who is she kidding?

42:18.361 --> 42:19.928
They are so having a thing.

42:19.972 --> 42:20.973
[laughs]

42:41.733 --> 42:43.604
[laughs]

42:47.347 --> 42:48.914
