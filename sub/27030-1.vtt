01:33.126 --> 01:38.087
That's how life is,
the same thing every day.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.631
That's what the cards teach us, gentlemen.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.471
Your bet may change, but the cards...

01:45.239 --> 01:46.900
the cards, they stay the same.

01:46.974 --> 01:48.942
The first card means nothing,

01:49.443 --> 01:51.138
the second card always loses,

01:51.645 --> 01:54.114
and the third card always wins.

01:54.181 --> 01:57.242
That's faro, my friends, the rules...

02:00.087 --> 02:01.418
they never change.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.892
Your cut, sir.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.756
What do you say, boys?

02:45.232 --> 02:46.427
Another round?

02:48.202 --> 02:51.536
Now, what's a man gotta do
to get a shake around here?

03:17.731 --> 03:19.130
You best not be a lunger.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.071
I seem to have offended you.

03:26.139 --> 03:28.130
That's what the cards tell us.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.404
Nothing... changes.

03:30.477 --> 03:31.876
Hobble your goddamn lip!

03:33.447 --> 03:34.812
Answer the question.

03:35.249 --> 03:37.217
Now, Mr. Anderson,

03:38.118 --> 03:39.882
I think that cough was more about

03:39.953 --> 03:42.945
the poor quality
of this man's taste in cigars.

03:45.692 --> 03:47.683
I do tend to like the cheap weed.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.861
Just got a little ambitious
on the first puff there, my friend.

03:54.735 --> 03:55.759
Mr. Anderson...

03:57.204 --> 03:59.332
why don't you take this back
to your table,

03:59.406 --> 04:01.704
and I'll see about getting you some food.

04:05.345 --> 04:06.608
That's more like it.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.276
I don't wanna hear another cough.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.127
He's all beer and skittles.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.730
I reckon so.

04:32.573 --> 04:33.938
Apple Jack?

04:34.007 --> 04:35.304
Jack or whiskey.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.254
On the dead.

04:48.655 --> 04:49.918
Oh, I can pay, ma'am.

04:49.990 --> 04:53.119
You wouldn't deny a little ol' lady
this simple pleasure, would ya?

04:53.827 --> 04:54.726
Flattered.

04:55.128 --> 04:55.890
Hungry?

04:56.930 --> 04:58.056
Like a thoroughbred.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.192
End of Chisholm here,
meat doesn't get any fresher.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.169
You the left-handed wife?

05:03.237 --> 05:05.729
Owner, madam, and bar wench

05:05.806 --> 05:07.865
when the situation so dictates.

05:08.675 --> 05:11.940
Well, anybody call you a wench
lacks the understanding of the meaning.

05:14.681 --> 05:15.807
He play for real?

05:19.553 --> 05:21.021
He's mostly bluster.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.411
Mostly.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.686
- He shouldn't be here.
- Just hold your mug.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.242
He's Texas high bred,
but a lowly creature.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.013
I wouldn't turn my back.

06:20.814 --> 06:21.804
High bred?

06:23.383 --> 06:26.842
Well, that would explain
the Pinkerton muscle flanking him.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.617
Pinkertons? How can you tell?

06:29.690 --> 06:31.124
Mmm.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.690
'Cause they always have
a difficulted expression on their face

06:34.761 --> 06:36.422
like they're taking a perplexin' shit.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.121
Makes sense.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.771
I know he doesn't look like much...

06:53.914 --> 06:56.508
but he was one of the only survivors
at Hyde Park.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.616
Hyde Park?

06:59.386 --> 07:01.286
You heard about what happened there?

07:01.889 --> 07:03.357
Yes, ma'am, I have.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.754
I don't mean to be brash,

07:12.332 --> 07:13.857
but have we met before?

07:14.301 --> 07:16.998
I believe I'd remember
if I met a beauty like you.

07:20.407 --> 07:21.465
Were you in Hyde Park?

07:22.476 --> 07:23.807
Lived there a few years back.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.637
So did that old gump back there.

07:27.181 --> 07:29.047
I've heard a lot about it.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.775
Tough to tell what's legend
and what's real.

07:32.186 --> 07:34.917
Guess that all depends
on who you heard it from.

07:35.355 --> 07:37.881
Well, you know how men can be
with their stories.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.722
Unlike most cowboys,

07:39.793 --> 07:42.228
we ladies don't embellish
the size of things.

07:42.296 --> 07:45.891
I'd love to hear your telling of it.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.298
It's along story, sugar.

07:48.368 --> 07:51.963
Well, you wouldn't deny an ol' stranger
a simple pleasure now, would ya?

07:53.273 --> 07:54.297
Aren't you a charmer.

08:10.390 --> 08:11.619
Well, stranger...

08:15.229 --> 08:17.095
some men are born in fire.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.394
Some men are born in shadows...

09:06.013 --> 09:07.071
In about a month,

09:07.514 --> 09:10.506
we will vote to decide
who should be running things around here.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.081
- Should it be the money men?
- No.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.179
Should those who live
on the other side of the tracks

09:16.256 --> 09:17.451
decide for the rest of us?

09:17.524 --> 09:18.582
- No!
- Hell, no.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.753
Now, we all know Clarence Potts,

09:20.828 --> 09:24.594
whose duties include county commissioner
as well as county judge now,

09:24.665 --> 09:26.064
is in their pockets.

09:27.201 --> 09:28.032
But I say

09:28.101 --> 09:29.694
we build those tracks.

09:30.204 --> 09:31.569
They're not a divider.

09:32.172 --> 09:35.073
We build those tracks!
We drive those cattle!

09:35.142 --> 09:36.439
- Yeah!
- That's right!

09:36.510 --> 09:39.571
Now, I know a lot of you have been hurt
by these land invalidations.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.671
They stole my granddad's farm.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.773
My mama, she lost her stock.

09:43.851 --> 09:46.081
I got my homestead
after I fought in the war.

09:46.153 --> 09:46.915
They got no right!

09:47.321 --> 09:49.187
And I hear each and every one of you.

09:49.690 --> 09:50.782
Elect me,

09:51.325 --> 09:53.851
and I'll make it my first priority
to restore order

09:53.927 --> 09:55.656
to these title disagreements.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.663
- Yeah!
- But, men,

09:58.298 --> 09:59.288
we gotta vote!

10:00.601 --> 10:02.626
Don't let the charlatans intimidate you.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.833
Your future's worth more than a nickel.

10:05.906 --> 10:06.771
Yeah.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.899
Money should not buy justice.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.611
The future should not be for sale.

10:12.679 --> 10:13.510
No!

10:14.081 --> 10:16.209
So vote Tim Johnston
for county commissioner

10:16.283 --> 10:18.149
and let's restore order to Newton.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.344
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

10:19.887 --> 10:22.720
Thank for your time,
and God bless America!

10:22.790 --> 10:24.986
Thank you.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.323
Excuse me, gentlemen.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.570
I hope Mr. Johnston
can forgive my intrusion.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.063
By all means, Rosie,

10:39.139 --> 10:41.801
give these fine gentlemen
a pretty face to look at instead of mine.

10:44.411 --> 10:47.210
Well, boys,
I don't know much about politics

10:47.281 --> 10:48.749
and land claims and the like,

10:48.816 --> 10:51.808
as these are not triers
a lady troubles her mind with.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.786
But I have known a few men in my day.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.254
Yeah.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.792
And you can pick out the good ones
'cause they are a rare lot.

11:01.462 --> 11:03.226
Tim Johnston is a good man.

11:04.298 --> 11:06.699
And to show our support here
at The Red Front,

11:06.767 --> 11:09.964
a vote for Tim Johnston
gets you a free tug from one of our girls.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.347
What the hell, boys.

11:25.619 --> 11:26.848
On your word...

11:26.920 --> 11:28.012
Yeah.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.853
...you boys promise
you'll vote for Tim Johnston?

11:30.924 --> 11:32.414
- Yeah!
- Promise.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.558
Then booze is half price
for the next 30 minutes.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.938
That's what the cards show us about life,
my friends.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.338
A man can be down to his last penny

11:48.408 --> 11:49.842
and still find his fortune.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.107
Thank you, sir.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.443
Now, gentlemen, always keep in mind
that in the game of faro,

11:54.515 --> 11:56.176
the first card always means nothing.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.218
The second card will always lose.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.344
And the second card is a six,
gentlemen, a six.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.354
And nobody has bet on the six.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.891
I told you! I told you six was no good.

12:05.793 --> 12:06.783
And you are correct, sir.

12:06.860 --> 12:09.557
We can find some right in life
even when we're feeling down on our luck.

12:10.364 --> 12:13.095
Always keep in mind, gentlemen,
that the third card may always win.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.532
And the third card is a ten.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.696
Winner to the ten!

12:17.771 --> 12:21.674
All it takes is to get it right once
and things can turn around.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.506
That's what the cards teach us, gentlemen.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.545
That is what the cards teach us.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.545
Break's over, back to work.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.294
Nice that you deign
to join us, darling.

12:43.730 --> 12:44.720
Is he here?

12:45.599 --> 12:46.896
Asked for you by name.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.561
Please, just tell him that I'm sick.

12:50.637 --> 12:52.731
Sweetheart, he's a big spender.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.192
Well, get in here, boy.

13:58.672 --> 13:59.730
Get a wiggle on.

14:02.776 --> 14:04.369
You been rattin' again?

14:09.082 --> 14:10.277
Boy, pop your corn.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.245
Gotta eat, ma'am.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.758
How many times you need to hear it?

14:19.560 --> 14:20.823
You can eat here.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.863
Fine.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.424
I can use a sweep boy.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.666
Well, you can't work hungry.

14:36.476 --> 14:37.443
Bit of food,

14:38.078 --> 14:39.239
then right as rain.

14:41.348 --> 14:42.509
Cherie, you back there?

14:44.284 --> 14:46.048
Ain't no place I'd rather be.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.388
Make our boy here some dinner.

14:49.957 --> 14:52.187
And find him something cleaner to wear.

15:05.239 --> 15:06.536
No!

15:08.075 --> 15:09.406
No...

15:12.312 --> 15:13.711
What's all the ruckus about?

15:14.348 --> 15:16.248
I'll tell you
what the ruckus is about.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.920
That dog don't fucking hunt!

15:20.988 --> 15:23.252
It wasn't my fault, I was trying.

15:23.323 --> 15:26.020
Whiskey dick.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.154
You think you're better than me?

15:33.700 --> 15:35.828
I could buy this whole goddamn town.

15:59.993 --> 16:03.054
Now surely, dear,
there's just been an unintentional slight.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.655
She's a witch-whore.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.724
She's just a scared child.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.230
I'll give you fair value for her...

16:11.305 --> 16:12.431
but in Texas...

16:13.974 --> 16:15.237
Whoo-whoo!

16:16.810 --> 16:18.505
we carve up our bitch-whore.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.113
Get back!

16:23.350 --> 16:25.409
Last I checked, this wasn't Texas.

16:32.926 --> 16:36.260
I have faith that we can get through this
without any more blood.

16:36.330 --> 16:38.128
You make one more move for your gun,

16:38.665 --> 16:40.497
and I will cut this twofer's throat.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.969
Now, I don't much care
for fair fights.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.263
- I'll cut her.
- No!

16:48.709 --> 16:50.643
I'd prefer to keep things
level headed.

16:51.879 --> 16:54.814
But if you ever
hurt that poor girl again...

16:57.718 --> 16:58.776
No.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.550
No!

17:23.109 --> 17:24.578
I'll be back for you, whore.

17:28.916 --> 17:29.906
Oh, damn.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.314
Not quite bloodless.

17:35.823 --> 17:36.813
Mike.

17:37.591 --> 17:38.581
Red.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.453
I appreciate your cooperation.

18:42.156 --> 18:43.180
Hey, Joe.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.626
Now, I'm not supposed to tell you
to go to The Red Front Saloon tonight.

18:48.762 --> 18:50.787
And I'm not supposed to tell you
to see Rosie,

18:50.864 --> 18:54.664
'cause she will never give you
a couple of free shooters.

18:55.636 --> 18:56.228
Deal?

19:01.175 --> 19:02.108
There we go.

19:02.676 --> 19:03.643
There we go.

19:28.569 --> 19:29.593
What the hell was that?

19:31.038 --> 19:33.006
The man fancies himself a Heyoke.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.939
Does everything backwards.

19:35.676 --> 19:36.575
Why?

19:37.244 --> 19:38.541
I try not to ask.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.511
Now, I'm gonna need your name.

19:54.695 --> 19:56.493
Wants to know my name.

19:58.999 --> 20:01.093
Hugh Anderson Jr.?

20:01.735 --> 20:03.897
As in the Anderson Ranch.

20:07.808 --> 20:09.276
I feel responsible.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.937
I knew he was taking a shine to her,

20:13.013 --> 20:14.981
<i>and she tried to tell me
he was being rough.</i>

20:16.150 --> 20:17.140
<i>How is she?</i>

20:19.019 --> 20:20.384
<i>He done her up real good.</i>

20:22.990 --> 20:24.321
<i>I'll need her at the courthouse.</i>

20:24.391 --> 20:25.381
<i>She'll be there.</i>

20:27.761 --> 20:29.627
<i>The boy should be okay, too.</i>

20:32.499 --> 20:34.399
- You and your strays.
- Mike.

20:34.468 --> 20:35.833
Please.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.963
How many times do I got to say no?

20:40.074 --> 20:41.906
That boy deserves something.

20:42.976 --> 20:44.205
He's got a good heart.

20:48.115 --> 20:49.776
And you could use...

20:52.319 --> 20:53.309
help.

20:54.922 --> 20:55.946
I don't need help.

20:59.860 --> 21:00.850
Mike.

21:01.862 --> 21:05.298
You know how slow death by consumption is.

21:08.402 --> 21:09.927
You don't know nothing about him,

21:10.904 --> 21:12.269
where he's come from, nothing.

21:13.006 --> 21:15.304
A lot of people once said
the same thing about you.

21:22.149 --> 21:23.583
Court's in a couple hours.

21:24.218 --> 21:25.208
Cluskie.

21:25.986 --> 21:27.078
Yeah, I'll think on it.

21:35.162 --> 21:36.652
Baby Hughie Anderson?

21:38.765 --> 21:41.291
Daddy owns the biggest cattle ranch
in Texas,

21:42.035 --> 21:44.129
most of the land
between here and Abilene now.

21:44.538 --> 21:45.528
Damn, Rosie!

21:46.673 --> 21:49.165
This is a fine steak.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.511
Why, thank you, darling.

21:52.146 --> 21:55.081
Not quite as good
as that nigger cooking you had, but

21:55.716 --> 21:57.184
hot damn, it's good.

21:58.051 --> 21:59.485
What was that nigger's name again?

21:59.953 --> 22:01.182
Boy, she could cook.

22:01.255 --> 22:03.622
I believe you mean Cherie.

22:03.690 --> 22:04.680
Yeah! That's it.

22:05.125 --> 22:06.786
Best nigger cooking I ever had.

22:11.832 --> 22:12.663
All done?

22:12.733 --> 22:15.361
I believe, somehow,
I just lost my appetite.

22:15.436 --> 22:18.337
Oh, no, darling,
that's the wrong way to look at this.

22:19.573 --> 22:22.133
Some small men need to feel big sometimes.

22:22.209 --> 22:23.574
I want to go home.

22:25.279 --> 22:26.371
If you're sure.

22:26.747 --> 22:28.442
I'll total you out.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.317
I'm just sorry you'll be missing out.

22:31.351 --> 22:32.546
Good news, darling.

22:32.619 --> 22:35.714
Turns out,
she will be available later, after all.

22:37.224 --> 22:40.524
Well, that... that is indeed glorious news.

22:40.961 --> 22:42.690
Thank you, friend.
I thought for a second there,

22:42.763 --> 22:44.026
I might be missing out.

22:45.866 --> 22:47.095
What's he talking about?

22:47.167 --> 22:48.293
Oh, Mr. Anderson,

22:48.368 --> 22:50.564
I'm sure you wouldn't be interested.

22:51.872 --> 22:52.964
Well, now, let's hear it.

22:53.040 --> 22:56.135
I'm sure a big,
important man like yourself

22:56.210 --> 22:58.975
has more important things
to be doing today.

22:59.446 --> 23:00.641
Out with it, woman.

23:01.682 --> 23:02.410
Well,

23:03.050 --> 23:06.987
I'm sure you're keenly aware
of the skill level of the French ladies

23:07.054 --> 23:08.544
who ply my trade.

23:09.623 --> 23:10.784
Is that so?

23:10.858 --> 23:12.155
Indeed it is.

23:12.659 --> 23:15.560
I sent our new girl, Lyla,
to the <i>Le Chabanais</i>

23:15.629 --> 23:17.290
to learn some of the new tricks.

23:19.166 --> 23:20.725
What kinda tricks?

23:22.469 --> 23:26.633
I'm told the ones
that make your toes curl so hard,

23:27.274 --> 23:28.742
your boots won't fit.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.741
Strong guarantee?

23:34.148 --> 23:35.343
I'll tell you what.

23:35.416 --> 23:36.440
Go on.

23:36.950 --> 23:39.009
Lyla'll be back presently.

23:39.820 --> 23:41.811
Why don't you let me
set you and your friends up

23:41.889 --> 23:44.654
with our finest rye while you wait?

23:46.393 --> 23:47.383
Then,

23:48.062 --> 23:49.928
if after Lyla's finished,

23:50.664 --> 23:52.655
you find my words to be false...

23:53.801 --> 23:56.065
I'll see to your satisfaction

23:56.870 --> 23:57.962
personally.

24:05.145 --> 24:06.135
Sorry, stranger.

24:07.581 --> 24:09.276
I guess you're gonna have to wait,
after all.

24:15.989 --> 24:18.287
Hope you'll accept this drink
as recompense.

24:19.059 --> 24:20.049
That's on me.

24:21.028 --> 24:22.189
That's mighty kind of you.

24:22.262 --> 24:24.230
Well.

24:27.334 --> 24:29.132
I just...

24:31.605 --> 24:32.663
We're gonna stay.

24:38.045 --> 24:39.911
Lowly creature, indeed.

24:41.115 --> 24:43.482
What kind of man
would raise a snake like that?

24:59.433 --> 25:00.832
Excuse me. Mr. Anderson.

25:00.901 --> 25:02.164
Mr. Anderson, sir.

25:02.670 --> 25:04.570
You're the new boy
they hired for the drive?

25:04.638 --> 25:06.037
Yes, sir. Mr. Bailey sent me ahead.

25:06.840 --> 25:07.807
- Did he?
- Yes, sir.

25:07.875 --> 25:09.639
He wanted me to make sure Mr. Anderson...

25:10.077 --> 25:12.341
the other Mr. Anderson knew
that Mr. Anderson was coming.

25:12.412 --> 25:13.880
Meaning you, Mr. Anderson.

25:13.947 --> 25:15.642
Call me Big Hugh.

25:15.716 --> 25:17.582
I came to find the other Mr. Anderson.

25:18.952 --> 25:21.046
Don't keep the pot boilin', boy.

25:21.121 --> 25:22.555
Hughie Jr.'s in jail, sir.

25:22.623 --> 25:24.318
He's goin' in front of the judge
this morning.

25:24.391 --> 25:26.155
He's only been here a couple of days.

25:26.860 --> 25:27.850
I don't know.

25:28.929 --> 25:32.524
All right, you go into town,
you find Judge Clarence Potts.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.533
You tell him Big Hugh insists.

25:35.035 --> 25:36.867
Then you get your ass
back on out to the ranch

25:36.937 --> 25:38.530
so you'll be there when Billy gets there.

25:39.273 --> 25:40.536
Billy, sir?

25:41.041 --> 25:42.133
Mr. Bailey.

25:42.509 --> 25:43.499
Yes, sir.

25:44.712 --> 25:45.702
Yes, sir.

26:19.880 --> 26:22.440
Sorry for my lateness. Sit. Sit.

26:24.585 --> 26:26.519
Well, Sheriff McCluskie, what's first?

26:26.587 --> 26:28.316
Judge Potts, we had an incident...

26:28.389 --> 26:31.051
This that thing
from The Red Front Saloon last night?

26:31.492 --> 26:34.223
- It is.
- And this is the girl in question?

26:34.294 --> 26:35.090
It is.

26:36.063 --> 26:37.690
Did you see it happen, Sheriff?

26:38.265 --> 26:40.199
- No, I did not.
- Well, then I'm certainly not

26:40.267 --> 26:42.929
convicting this man
on the word of a whore.

26:43.003 --> 26:44.437
Dismissed.

26:45.572 --> 26:48.405
Mr. Anderson is free to go.
Kindly unshackle him, Sheriff.

26:48.475 --> 26:50.773
- Judge Potts, I don't think you...
- Now!

26:50.844 --> 26:53.245
Sheriff McCluskie. Now!

26:53.313 --> 26:54.280
Please.

26:59.419 --> 27:00.147
Is there anything else?

27:00.854 --> 27:02.015
No!

27:02.089 --> 27:04.786
I'm not hearing any land claims today.

27:05.192 --> 27:06.387
I'm sorry.

27:07.394 --> 27:10.056
All right. We're done here for today.

27:10.130 --> 27:11.928
- Adjourned!
- Judge Potts...

27:14.301 --> 27:15.564
Judge Potts!

27:15.636 --> 27:17.536
Clarence, please don't make me chase you.

27:18.205 --> 27:19.195
What was that?

27:19.807 --> 27:22.572
People already say we need to build our
own courthouse on this side of the tracks.

27:22.643 --> 27:23.769
Maybe you should.

27:24.812 --> 27:27.907
Clarence, we've known each other
a long time, and this isn't you.

27:27.981 --> 27:29.278
You think I don't know

27:29.349 --> 27:32.410
that your friends
are actively campaigning against me?

27:33.687 --> 27:35.052
That's what this is about?

27:35.456 --> 27:37.948
There's a reason why women can't vote.

27:39.927 --> 27:41.417
You saw what he did to her.

27:43.530 --> 27:45.794
Christ, Clarence,
this is only an election.

27:46.500 --> 27:47.695
People just want a little change.

27:48.268 --> 27:50.737
Elections are an ugly business, Mike.

27:51.839 --> 27:55.639
Maybe that red-headed friend of yours
should've just stayed out of it.

28:00.981 --> 28:02.745
I don't mean to be brash, ma'am, but...

28:04.318 --> 28:05.979
did Mike know you were in love with him?

28:07.354 --> 28:09.584
Couple of years or so
after his son died...

28:11.391 --> 28:12.950
his wife got the cough.

28:15.229 --> 28:17.493
<i>He started hitting the bottle, hard.</i>

28:18.565 --> 28:19.862
<i>We all noticed it.</i>

28:22.302 --> 28:23.633
<i>Last time I saw her...</i>

28:25.339 --> 28:27.307
<i>she was barely upright,</i>

28:28.108 --> 28:29.166
<i>barely breathing.</i>

28:31.578 --> 28:33.046
<i>When she looked at me...</i>

28:35.415 --> 28:37.611
<i>I knew she knew.</i>

28:40.287 --> 28:42.722
<i>People said it was her lungs
that finally took her...</i>

28:44.892 --> 28:47.589
<i>but the lungs don't work
when the heart is broken.</i>

28:49.496 --> 28:52.522
<i>I guess it was only the two of us
who ever really understood him.</i>

28:57.171 --> 28:59.230
I tried to talk to him
the night she passed.

28:59.973 --> 29:01.338
But his eyes changed.

29:05.312 --> 29:06.746
<i>He went somewhere else.</i>

29:08.449 --> 29:11.419
<i>Couple of drinks in,
one of my gins screamed from upstairs.</i>

29:12.019 --> 29:13.509
<i>Some miner busted her up.</i>

29:14.822 --> 29:15.948
<i>He put down his glass...</i>

29:17.224 --> 29:19.022
<i>walked upstairs, real calm.</i>

29:19.927 --> 29:21.053
<i>Let himself in.</i>

29:25.432 --> 29:27.730
<i>Some men are born for violence.</i>

29:32.673 --> 29:33.663
Rough town...

29:34.942 --> 29:36.239
needed a rough sheriff.

30:50.818 --> 30:51.876
A day early?

30:52.286 --> 30:53.048
Good weather.

30:53.887 --> 30:54.979
How many we lose?

30:55.055 --> 30:56.819
Count's currently seven short.

30:57.724 --> 30:58.520
Seven?

30:59.293 --> 31:00.954
- That what you boys got?
- Yes, sir.

31:01.028 --> 31:02.518
Yep, yep.

31:03.097 --> 31:04.030
How about you?

31:05.799 --> 31:07.130
I was supposed to count?

31:15.309 --> 31:16.470
Seven's not too bad.

31:16.543 --> 31:18.534
No. No, sir, it ain't.

31:19.146 --> 31:22.548
Funny thing,
we lost four of 'em two nights ago.

31:23.150 --> 31:24.743
So, I did a little scoutin'

31:25.185 --> 31:28.883
and I found 'em hunkered down in that bed
a few miles north of the butte.

31:28.956 --> 31:31.152
Right where somebody left 'em.

32:19.606 --> 32:21.370
So, the count is three?

32:21.442 --> 32:22.432
Three.

32:24.511 --> 32:25.637
Brand him,

32:25.712 --> 32:27.703
string him up on the fence line.

32:28.148 --> 32:29.741
Let him same as a warning.

32:30.784 --> 32:32.183
Don't fuck with a Texan.

32:39.660 --> 32:40.752
A new sheriff?

32:41.628 --> 32:43.392
Potts can appoint anyone he wants.

32:43.464 --> 32:45.228
He's commissioner and judge now.

32:45.599 --> 32:47.067
How would that even work?

32:47.501 --> 32:51.267
Please don't tell the girl
that this was not a grave injustice.

32:52.239 --> 32:55.334
And as always,
damn life is completely fair.

32:56.844 --> 32:57.834
Thank you.

32:58.278 --> 33:01.441
Justice, justice, justice for all!

33:01.515 --> 33:04.177
Justice, justice, justice for all!

33:09.323 --> 33:10.586
His name's Billy Bailey.

33:11.892 --> 33:13.656
First, they take all our farms.

33:14.294 --> 33:15.659
And now a new sheriff?

33:16.897 --> 33:18.092
If nothing else, Red...

33:19.333 --> 33:21.358
you're finally gonna get what you want.

33:29.777 --> 33:31.836
People just want a fair shake at it.

33:33.080 --> 33:36.175
They want to keep what their fathers
and grandfathers were given.

33:36.250 --> 33:39.117
I stood next to you in the war,

33:39.586 --> 33:41.816
and I want you to know
that I stand with you now,

33:42.222 --> 33:43.883
- beholden to no man...
- Whoa, whoa.

33:43.957 --> 33:45.322
Hey, hey, Faro Fred.

33:45.392 --> 33:46.382
Sheriff?

33:46.894 --> 33:48.623
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

33:49.430 --> 33:50.829
I think it's time for you to go home.

33:50.898 --> 33:54.357
I think it's time for you
to mind your own damn business.

33:54.935 --> 33:56.266
Go sleep it off, Fred.

33:56.336 --> 33:57.997
I'm going to the saloon.

33:58.071 --> 33:59.937
And try to stay away
from the tables tonight.

34:14.254 --> 34:15.244
Hey, boy.

34:18.257 --> 34:19.487
What's your name?

34:29.636 --> 34:30.626
James.

34:32.105 --> 34:33.094
No.

34:34.842 --> 34:35.831
It's Shadow.

34:37.710 --> 34:39.907
'Cause you're gonna stick to me
and stay silent,

34:40.547 --> 34:42.036
just like my shadow.

34:43.884 --> 34:44.942
Am I in trouble?

34:47.054 --> 34:48.043
Follow me.

34:52.960 --> 34:53.984
Did I stutter?

34:54.728 --> 34:56.092
Get your things.

35:28.562 --> 35:31.759
Clarence, I really appreciate you
seeing him all the way home.

35:31.832 --> 35:33.891
It's the least I could do, Mr. Anderson.

35:33.967 --> 35:35.298
Ah, I appreciate that.

35:35.369 --> 35:38.100
Hey, Tex, will you tell Billy
to come up to the house, please?

35:38.672 --> 35:39.696
Yep, yep.

35:40.808 --> 35:43.573
Clarence, could you wait
while I have a moment with my son?

35:43.644 --> 35:44.509
Well, of course.

35:44.578 --> 35:45.841
Thank you.

35:46.413 --> 35:48.438
Come on with me. Over here.

35:52.820 --> 35:54.049
Look at me.

35:54.121 --> 35:55.316
How long you been in town?

35:55.389 --> 35:56.857
It was that damn sheriff, Daddy.

35:57.424 --> 35:58.482
Did I ask you that?

35:59.359 --> 36:01.088
What I'm asking you is, who is that?

36:01.762 --> 36:04.493
- Daddy...
- Is that the boy you hired for the drive?

36:05.733 --> 36:07.462
If Billy hadn't been there,

36:07.534 --> 36:09.298
he would've gotten away
with four head of my cattle.

36:10.804 --> 36:13.933
You said you needed an extra hand,
and it was short notice.

36:14.007 --> 36:16.704
So you hired a man you didn't trust
to herd my cattle?

36:16.777 --> 36:17.608
No.

36:17.678 --> 36:20.045
Take him out there
to the front fence line,

36:20.114 --> 36:21.343
and hang that body up.

36:22.016 --> 36:23.711
Can't Billy do that?

36:23.784 --> 36:26.014
Billy is done
cleaning up your shit.

36:26.420 --> 36:28.787
I want you to do it,
and I mean, do it on foot.

36:29.156 --> 36:30.646
If I see you on horseback,

36:31.058 --> 36:33.083
I will whip your ass. Now go on.

36:33.694 --> 36:35.162
- Go on.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

36:38.065 --> 36:39.328
- Judge Potts.
- Yeah.

36:40.033 --> 36:42.092
Let's have a drink, huh? On me.

36:42.169 --> 36:44.968
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate that. I really do.

37:01.588 --> 37:04.683
Rosie's been on me for as long
as I can remember to get a deputy.

37:10.965 --> 37:12.228
You know how to use it?

37:15.369 --> 37:16.700
Well, we'll work on that.

37:18.906 --> 37:21.807
Sleep there.
And use the bath hall once a week.

37:24.278 --> 37:25.473
But I'm a lunger.

37:27.314 --> 37:30.750
Well, if I can sleep over Joe's snoring,
I can sleep over your coughing.

37:32.286 --> 37:33.776
I can't take your bed.

37:34.855 --> 37:35.845
I'll make do.

37:39.026 --> 37:40.494
Rosie said you ran right at him.

37:42.496 --> 37:43.486
Who?

37:44.631 --> 37:45.621
Anderson.

37:48.268 --> 37:49.497
Didn't do so good.

37:55.042 --> 37:57.238
Yeah,
this election has everything shaken up.

37:57.311 --> 37:58.437
People are anxious.

37:59.113 --> 38:01.673
So, from now, keep your mouth shut,

38:01.749 --> 38:03.615
pay attention to everything I do.

38:17.331 --> 38:18.856
Yeah, we'll work on that too.

38:22.669 --> 38:24.000
He wants what?

38:24.071 --> 38:24.833
Well,

38:25.339 --> 38:28.604
he wants to have a meetin'
in the dance hall

38:29.376 --> 38:34.109
to establish parameters
with the new county sheriff.

38:36.984 --> 38:38.782
"Establish parameters"?

38:38.852 --> 38:41.082
- He really said it?
- Yes, sir.

38:43.824 --> 38:46.316
What's it gonna cost us
to tin up this hero?

38:48.028 --> 38:51.054
Mike McCluskie doesn't work that way.

38:52.066 --> 38:54.501
There wouldn't be
any parameters to establish

38:54.568 --> 38:57.037
if he just understood
who the law's working for.

39:00.574 --> 39:02.042
You see any harm in it?

39:03.210 --> 39:05.474
Oh, I'd kinda like to meet
this Sheriff McCluskie.

39:07.881 --> 39:10.873
You better, uh, deputize Otis and Tex.

39:12.286 --> 39:14.812
You know what, put a badge on Hughie, too.

39:14.888 --> 39:18.654
Let's see what he does.
My boy, the lawman, huh?

39:26.266 --> 39:29.031
There's a war coming to Hyde Park,
Clarence.

39:30.304 --> 39:31.396
We all feel it.

39:32.973 --> 39:35.135
It's this Tim Johnston fella.

39:35.809 --> 39:37.072
Union sergeant.

39:37.745 --> 39:41.079
He worked both the railroad
and the cow towns.

39:41.148 --> 39:43.082
People seem to like him.

39:44.017 --> 39:46.577
Let me tend to Tim Johnston.

39:47.821 --> 39:49.846
You just focus on those land claims.

39:50.657 --> 39:52.125
Let me ask you something.

39:52.726 --> 39:56.185
Do you enjoy being judge and commissioner,
Clarence?

39:56.263 --> 39:57.492
Yes, of course.

39:57.564 --> 39:59.430
How would you feel about
being governor someday?

40:00.734 --> 40:01.826
Governor?

40:01.902 --> 40:03.301
I think I'd like that.

40:05.472 --> 40:07.201
You know, when I had this place built,

40:07.875 --> 40:11.607
I had a vision of looking out
and seeing the land, my land,

40:11.678 --> 40:13.339
reaching out for the horizon.

40:14.481 --> 40:17.849
Now the law is telling me that

40:17.918 --> 40:20.683
it ain't really all my land yet,
is it, Clarence?

40:21.155 --> 40:26.218
Well, a lot of these land claims
can be invalidated on

40:26.693 --> 40:28.127
legal error,

40:28.195 --> 40:31.893
but the ones that have been held
through third and fourth generation

40:31.965 --> 40:33.933
might be a bit harder.

40:34.001 --> 40:34.991
Well,

40:35.669 --> 40:38.331
I guess we'd just better make sure
you win that election.

40:38.806 --> 40:42.367
Well, we can't just
buy the votes this time.

40:43.777 --> 40:45.973
There's more than one way to geld a horse.

40:49.249 --> 40:50.444
Yeah, all right.

42:27.247 --> 42:28.339
Damn, boy.

42:29.383 --> 42:30.373
Perk up.

42:31.218 --> 42:34.552
Your daddy went and made me
Harvey County Sheriff.

42:34.621 --> 42:36.851
He made you a deputy.

42:46.967 --> 42:49.993
Rosie know you're an unfaithful cad?

42:50.070 --> 42:53.597
The dance hall closes at ten,
and then Ideal for Rosie.

42:53.674 --> 42:54.869
Bets, gentlemen. Bets.

42:55.476 --> 42:57.035
Sounds like the best of both worlds.

42:57.111 --> 42:58.078
Like the cards tell us.

42:58.479 --> 43:00.504
The best of both worlds can be

43:00.581 --> 43:01.980
a push.

43:02.049 --> 43:03.244
Push, gentlemen.

43:03.317 --> 43:05.843
No bets lost and no bets paid.

43:17.364 --> 43:19.025
Dance on the inside, dumb shit.

43:19.533 --> 43:22.833
Indeed, which is why I dance outside.

43:25.072 --> 43:26.062
What's wrong with you?

43:26.774 --> 43:27.935
"What's wrong with you?"

43:34.982 --> 43:36.211
He's full as a tick.

44:42.850 --> 44:44.284
You ain't look like much.

44:48.489 --> 44:49.547
These your deputies?

44:52.192 --> 44:53.125
I'll take mine.

44:58.699 --> 45:00.531
Quit breathing my air, lunger.

45:03.370 --> 45:05.998
You smell like shit,
and I live in an alley.

45:06.073 --> 45:07.939
All right, all right.

45:10.310 --> 45:12.540
I just wanted to make sure
we understood each other before...

45:12.613 --> 45:13.944
Nothing to understand.

45:15.049 --> 45:16.539
You worry about yours,

45:16.984 --> 45:18.247
and we'll worry about ours.

45:20.754 --> 45:21.915
What does that even mean?

45:21.989 --> 45:23.286
Keep your filth

45:23.791 --> 45:26.158
and whores on their side of the tracks.

45:26.560 --> 45:27.550
'Bout sums it up.

45:27.961 --> 45:29.360
Yep, yep.

45:33.600 --> 45:35.659
The dance hall's on the Newton side.

45:36.303 --> 45:38.237
Well, ain't that just a pickled okra?

45:40.040 --> 45:42.134
Even the "filth" get gussied up
to come here.

45:43.744 --> 45:45.109
Can we call it neutral ground?

45:47.748 --> 45:48.840
Fine.

45:49.249 --> 45:51.081
But only the dance hall.

45:55.089 --> 45:58.059
Everybody feel like they got
their understandings all figured?

46:01.061 --> 46:02.187
Good.

46:03.464 --> 46:05.125
Time to go to work, boys.

46:27.821 --> 46:29.380
You need
to get back on that train.

46:30.057 --> 46:31.957
You ain't welcome
on this side of the tracks.

46:32.026 --> 46:33.653
Hotter than a whorehouse
in there.

46:34.228 --> 46:37.493
We always come out from both sides.
It'd take forever if we didn't.

46:38.732 --> 46:39.858
Hey!

46:56.383 --> 46:58.147
Get off me. Get off.

47:07.461 --> 47:08.451
That's enough.

47:09.663 --> 47:10.653
Don't.

47:11.865 --> 47:13.697
I said, don't.

47:16.103 --> 47:17.093
Get up.

47:22.609 --> 47:24.839
Now your rules will be respected, Sheriff.

47:26.580 --> 47:27.706
You're a new sheriff.

47:29.450 --> 47:30.508
This is a new rule.

47:31.552 --> 47:34.283
So how 'bout you let these men
have a couple of days to learn it?

47:39.893 --> 47:40.883
Fine.

47:41.996 --> 47:43.555
But you all hear this.

47:43.630 --> 47:45.155
There ain't no couple of days shit.

47:46.066 --> 47:48.091
You spread the word tonight.

47:48.836 --> 47:50.463
Stay on your side of the tracks.

47:55.075 --> 47:56.065
Thank you.

47:57.745 --> 47:58.837
Get him to the infirmary.

48:16.730 --> 48:17.720
This ain't over.

48:24.471 --> 48:25.461
Soon.

48:39.787 --> 48:40.777
You all right?

48:41.989 --> 48:42.979
Yeah.

48:47.828 --> 48:48.818
Come on.

49:01.775 --> 49:02.901
So that's it then?

49:04.111 --> 49:06.011
They're just going to sit out there
all day and night

49:06.080 --> 49:08.242
and shoot anyone who comes across?

49:09.383 --> 49:11.078
So we're like cattle, then?

49:12.386 --> 49:13.649
Hell, we're worse than cattle.

49:13.721 --> 49:15.780
Cattle don't get shot when they stray.

49:16.457 --> 49:17.925
I know you're mad.

49:19.560 --> 49:20.550
I'm mad, too.

49:21.195 --> 49:23.960
Which is exactly why we all need
to ease up on the reins.

49:24.031 --> 49:26.159
And Potts can just appoint
another sheriff?

49:26.233 --> 49:27.462
No.

49:27.534 --> 49:28.797
By law...

49:29.870 --> 49:30.598
yes.

49:31.672 --> 49:33.003
Well, I don't know about you,

49:33.073 --> 49:34.905
but I am sick of living by their laws.

49:34.975 --> 49:37.637
We all just need to hold out a couple more
days to get through this election.

49:40.781 --> 49:41.771
They'll learn...

49:43.050 --> 49:44.074
won't they, Tex?

49:46.787 --> 49:48.380
You don't mess with a Texan.

49:48.889 --> 49:50.084
Yep, yep.

49:50.157 --> 49:51.522
Texas.

49:51.592 --> 49:54.584
So much land and yet such a small place.

49:57.664 --> 50:00.361
Lay down, boy.
It's that ol' coot playing with you.

50:02.169 --> 50:04.137
Well, I'm sick of people thinking
I'm someone to play with.

50:04.204 --> 50:05.672
Play is for children...

50:06.673 --> 50:08.937
but some men act like children.

50:16.850 --> 50:19.080
I'm loaded for bears. It ain't funny.

50:19.586 --> 50:20.576
Yep, yep.

50:23.090 --> 50:24.785
I'm not the one hiding in the dark.

50:27.861 --> 50:29.056
Come out so we can see you.

50:30.297 --> 50:31.287
Hiding?

50:32.633 --> 50:35.398
The darkness is where we are truly seen.

50:38.038 --> 50:39.836
He got you there, boy.

50:58.459 --> 50:59.449
Yep, yep.

51:06.066 --> 51:09.366
I am done... with this backwards shit.

51:11.972 --> 51:13.064
You get back over there.

51:15.042 --> 51:17.374
Living backwards can be exhausting.

51:19.246 --> 51:20.611
You must be very tired.

51:22.282 --> 51:23.272
What's that again?

51:24.384 --> 51:27.046
From constantly pretending
you're not a coward.

51:46.106 --> 51:47.096
Can I buy you a drink?

51:49.276 --> 51:50.710
Thank you, but no.

51:55.616 --> 51:56.742
Still sober?

51:57.918 --> 51:59.886
Well, some days are easier than others.

52:04.892 --> 52:05.882
Can I ask you something?

52:07.194 --> 52:08.184
It depends.

52:11.665 --> 52:13.827
Why didn't you leave when May passed?

52:15.703 --> 52:17.637
I guess I never had anywhere else to go.

52:20.641 --> 52:22.302
I want you to stop punishing yourself.

52:22.376 --> 52:23.172
Tim, please.

52:23.244 --> 52:25.269
You don't owe this town
a goddamn thing, Mike.

52:26.313 --> 52:28.304
Get a little ranch and start over.

52:30.250 --> 52:31.843
Can you really see me farming?

52:34.955 --> 52:36.855
Shit, you can barely ride a horse.

52:40.761 --> 52:41.489
Cherie?

52:42.596 --> 52:43.586
Are you all right?

52:45.499 --> 52:46.523
Cherie?

52:52.239 --> 52:53.172
They shot Joe.

52:54.642 --> 52:55.438
What?

52:55.509 --> 52:56.533
Heyoke Joe.

52:58.946 --> 53:00.072
Down by the tracks.

53:01.181 --> 53:02.012
They shot him.

53:04.385 --> 53:06.376
Folks are saying he's dead.

53:07.454 --> 53:08.216
Who shot him?

53:08.622 --> 53:11.319
- You know damn well who.
- Tim, let me handle this.

53:11.692 --> 53:13.524
How much more, Mike, huh?

53:13.594 --> 53:16.222
How much more "law"
are we gonna have to stomach?

53:16.296 --> 53:18.560
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I, for one, am sick of their law.

53:19.299 --> 53:22.166
It lets them take our land,
let them shoot us down in the street?

53:22.236 --> 53:23.203
No.

53:23.270 --> 53:25.034
They can have their law.

53:25.105 --> 53:27.199
I say it's time for some justice!

53:27.274 --> 53:28.867
Come on. Let's get 'em.

53:32.980 --> 53:34.345
Put some meat into it.

53:37.551 --> 53:38.609
Looks like they're coming.

53:39.119 --> 53:39.950
Tex?

53:40.020 --> 53:41.146
Yep, yep.

53:44.658 --> 53:45.682
Let's get those guys.

53:47.261 --> 53:48.888
Justice for Joe!

53:48.962 --> 53:49.952
Come on!

53:51.232 --> 53:52.529
Took you long enough.

53:53.534 --> 53:55.127
Which one of you cowards killed Joe?

53:58.972 --> 54:00.997
I shot him.

54:01.775 --> 54:03.106
I told him not to come over here.

54:03.177 --> 54:04.372
Then it's you we want.

54:04.445 --> 54:05.503
Yeah!

54:06.614 --> 54:09.413
The other two men can step aside,
if you so choose.

54:09.483 --> 54:10.780
We do not so choose.

54:11.385 --> 54:12.375
Wait! Wait!

54:13.153 --> 54:14.245
This is exactly what he wants.

54:14.321 --> 54:16.050
Good! 'Cause he's gonna get it.

54:16.123 --> 54:17.113
Tim, listen.

54:17.558 --> 54:18.992
He's looking for an excuse to kill you.

54:19.059 --> 54:20.356
He's just gonna have to kill me, then.

54:20.427 --> 54:21.292
I'm not hard to find.

54:21.362 --> 54:22.693
Look at these people!

54:23.664 --> 54:26.395
If he kills you in a fight
or for breaking the new sheriff's law,

54:26.467 --> 54:28.697
then even if it's bullshit,
it's still legal.

54:30.704 --> 54:32.035
And that's Anderson's son.

54:32.940 --> 54:36.035
If you kill him, there'll be an army
of Pinkertons here within the week.

54:36.443 --> 54:38.969
And either way, you end up dead.
So do most of these men.

54:43.717 --> 54:44.946
Tim...

54:46.386 --> 54:47.114
please.

54:55.129 --> 54:56.358
I'll tend to the body.

55:01.168 --> 55:02.158
All right.

55:19.119 --> 55:20.109
Only three of you?

55:23.057 --> 55:25.116
Number four somewhere
out there with that Henry?

55:25.860 --> 55:27.089
The night is young.

55:28.128 --> 55:29.289
We may yet find out.

55:35.936 --> 55:37.631
I put some honey under your cot.

55:38.439 --> 55:39.429
Eat a little.

55:59.460 --> 56:00.291
Thanks.

56:02.529 --> 56:03.894
My boy had the same cough.

56:05.699 --> 56:07.497
My wife said the honey helped him sleep.

56:09.937 --> 56:10.927
What was his name?

56:13.908 --> 56:14.898
Paul.

56:18.045 --> 56:20.036
Sounds like he would've made
a good sheriff too.

56:43.937 --> 56:44.927
Nah, just...

56:46.273 --> 56:47.263
Joe...

56:48.375 --> 56:49.900
and that whole Heyoke thing.

56:54.948 --> 56:56.541
I can't believe they shot him.

57:10.197 --> 57:13.132
These are gonna heal up
real nicely, I think.

57:16.303 --> 57:17.702
Please don't put me out.

57:18.438 --> 57:19.200
What?

57:19.673 --> 57:20.868
I'll do other things.

57:21.875 --> 57:22.865
I'll clean.

57:23.410 --> 57:24.400
I'll learn to cook.

57:24.478 --> 57:25.968
I'm not gonna put you out.

57:26.046 --> 57:27.912
Why would you think such thoughts?

57:29.216 --> 57:30.411
I ain't worth nothin'.

57:32.086 --> 57:33.281
I ain't pretty no more.

57:36.757 --> 57:38.486
Our young friend would disagree.

57:44.565 --> 57:45.794
What happened here?

57:49.670 --> 57:50.933
I'm serious now.

57:52.773 --> 57:53.968
What happened?

57:55.209 --> 57:57.507
It's like somebody died in here.

57:58.345 --> 57:59.403
Run.

58:00.414 --> 58:01.575
Of all the nerve.

58:14.194 --> 58:16.094
I'm here for the witch-whore.

58:19.967 --> 58:22.129
And this...

58:23.003 --> 58:23.993
says I can have her.

58:25.172 --> 58:27.573
You are not welcome here.

58:31.145 --> 58:32.704
No shotgun this time.

58:33.514 --> 58:35.039
Well, that's good.

58:35.115 --> 58:37.049
Because it occurred to me...

58:38.218 --> 58:39.583
that the witch-whore

58:39.653 --> 58:42.645
might be... you.

58:53.601 --> 58:55.399
That's enough, James.

58:56.737 --> 58:57.499
Watch my back.

59:05.112 --> 59:06.204
No, no, no.

59:07.581 --> 59:09.777
I think this belongs to her now.

59:10.417 --> 59:12.181
My daddy gave me that knife. So...

59:13.353 --> 59:15.685
You're gonna stay right there
for the time being.

59:18.592 --> 59:19.582
Get a rope.

59:20.761 --> 59:22.855
Nobody's gonna do any such thing.

59:23.363 --> 59:24.660
He killed Joe.

59:24.732 --> 59:26.860
So he'll go in front of the judge for it.

59:28.068 --> 59:29.058
Potts?

59:30.404 --> 59:32.498
You know he won't do
a damn thing about it.

59:33.240 --> 59:35.402
Well, then we'll make him do it
in a public court

59:36.110 --> 59:37.475
right before election day.

59:42.649 --> 59:43.844
Now...

59:44.385 --> 59:48.549
I'm beginning to think that
Big Hugh wants us to kill you, boy.

59:48.622 --> 59:51.057
You don't know a goddamn thing
about my daddy.

59:51.124 --> 59:53.593
Well, I know his grown son
still calls him Daddy.

59:55.395 --> 59:57.363
- Get up, come on.
- Turn loose of him!

01:00:01.135 --> 01:00:02.125
Draw slow.

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:03.960
Just get your gun out.

01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:10.600
Well...

01:00:11.812 --> 01:00:13.211
There's that Henry.

01:00:13.781 --> 01:00:15.215
I said turn him loose.

01:00:16.617 --> 01:00:17.948
Now.

01:00:19.286 --> 01:00:20.048
No.

01:00:24.625 --> 01:00:25.854
So this is it, then?

01:00:27.394 --> 01:00:28.452
I want a challenge.

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:30.495
A what?

01:00:31.698 --> 01:00:33.063
Thought you were a Texan.

01:00:34.067 --> 01:00:35.831
I want the lawman's challenge.

01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:38.395
I never heard of the lawman's challenge.

01:00:39.206 --> 01:00:40.435
Well,

01:00:40.507 --> 01:00:43.204
when two lawmen
have an unresolvable dispute...

01:00:47.181 --> 01:00:48.205
they face off.

01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:51.177
Oh, sure,

01:00:51.251 --> 01:00:54.118
you sucker me out into the street
to draw against you.

01:00:54.188 --> 01:00:56.486
You think I'm that dumb?

01:00:56.557 --> 01:00:57.547
No.

01:00:58.159 --> 01:00:59.991
That's not how real lawmen do it.

01:01:02.796 --> 01:01:03.786
No weapons.

01:01:05.265 --> 01:01:06.960
I win,

01:01:07.034 --> 01:01:08.433
I keep him

01:01:09.336 --> 01:01:11.703
and you and your men go
and don't come back.

01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:14.931
And when I win?

01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:18.073
You never see me.

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:21.179
Or my deputy again.

01:01:32.393 --> 01:01:33.554
Come on, big man.

01:01:35.062 --> 01:01:36.996
You're the one that said
I don't look like much.

01:01:45.205 --> 01:01:46.673
All right, Sheriff.

01:01:47.808 --> 01:01:48.798
I'll dance.

01:01:49.943 --> 01:01:50.967
Keep an eye on them.

01:01:55.282 --> 01:01:57.649
You couldn't just shoot the idiot kid,
could you?

01:02:33.721 --> 01:02:35.018
You son of a bitch.

01:02:54.775 --> 01:02:56.265
Hey, hey.

01:02:57.211 --> 01:02:58.269
Come on back now.

01:03:00.514 --> 01:03:01.504
We're done.

01:03:08.455 --> 01:03:09.980
Sheriff, I gotta tell you something.

01:03:30.644 --> 01:03:32.908
Take your provisions and make haste.
Head north.

01:03:33.413 --> 01:03:34.403
I ain't running.

01:03:36.717 --> 01:03:37.741
I'll meet 'em tonight.

01:03:38.519 --> 01:03:41.079
The dance hall is neutral ground.
Hopefully they'll honor that.

01:03:42.189 --> 01:03:43.179
And if not?

01:03:43.824 --> 01:03:46.816
Well, if not, whatever comes,
Violet'll be in the middle of it.

01:03:46.894 --> 01:03:47.861
What about Rosie?

01:03:49.096 --> 01:03:51.565
I want you to deliver this
to the name I've written on the back.

01:03:51.632 --> 01:03:53.498
- I don't understand.
- Promise me you'll do it.

01:03:54.101 --> 01:03:55.364
I told you, I ain't runnin'.

01:03:55.435 --> 01:03:56.630
I said, promise me.

01:04:02.643 --> 01:04:05.112
You told me to stick to you
like your shadow, right?

01:04:05.179 --> 01:04:06.112
Yep, it's what I said.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:09.172
Well, I ain't never heard of a man
sending his shadow away before.

01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:10.240
Have you?

01:04:10.651 --> 01:04:11.641
It's not safe.

01:04:14.355 --> 01:04:15.345
Please.

01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:17.280
Let me help.

01:04:22.663 --> 01:04:23.653
All right. Here.

01:04:25.132 --> 01:04:26.497
I want you to cross draw.

01:04:31.538 --> 01:04:32.528
No, no.

01:04:32.973 --> 01:04:33.963
Take your time.

01:04:38.479 --> 01:04:39.469
Again.

01:04:44.218 --> 01:04:46.653
Now, don't let the head rush
what the hand can't.

01:04:48.088 --> 01:04:49.078
Be in the moment.

01:04:50.557 --> 01:04:51.547
Slow down.

01:04:53.694 --> 01:04:54.684
Breathe.

01:04:58.399 --> 01:05:00.231
And pull.

01:05:15.816 --> 01:05:17.181
Son of a bitch.

01:05:18.519 --> 01:05:19.645
You dumb fuck.

01:05:20.254 --> 01:05:21.244
Please, stop.

01:05:21.922 --> 01:05:23.447
I always thought it would be you.

01:05:24.291 --> 01:05:25.884
I thought they'd kill you!

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:28.121
And then I could be like the governor,

01:05:28.195 --> 01:05:31.165
and maybe be like an avenging angel
and come here and take whatever I wanted.

01:05:31.232 --> 01:05:32.495
But no, not you!

01:05:33.834 --> 01:05:36.360
And you turn around and get Billy killed!

01:05:36.737 --> 01:05:37.727
Billy!

01:05:38.272 --> 01:05:39.262
You son of a...

01:05:40.574 --> 01:05:43.271
Daddy, stop. Please.

01:05:44.411 --> 01:05:46.903
Don't you look at me!
Daddy! Daddy!

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:48.243
Don't you...

01:05:55.956 --> 01:05:57.321
Don't you cry!

01:05:57.391 --> 01:05:58.654
Son of a bitch!

01:06:01.729 --> 01:06:03.060
You'll make up for it.

01:06:03.597 --> 01:06:04.826
He killed a Texan!

01:06:05.666 --> 01:06:06.997
You kill him!

01:06:07.701 --> 01:06:09.726
Or I never want to see you again.

01:06:09.803 --> 01:06:11.237
If I do,

01:06:11.305 --> 01:06:13.137
I'll kill you.

01:06:18.345 --> 01:06:21.440
There's no such thing
as a lawman's challenge, is there?

01:06:24.618 --> 01:06:26.484
Always like to play to the gallery.

01:06:33.761 --> 01:06:34.751
How's he doing?

01:06:36.797 --> 01:06:38.196
Well, it's just like you said.

01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:40.600
He runs right toward danger.

01:06:46.006 --> 01:06:47.064
That's not what I meant.

01:06:50.644 --> 01:06:52.043
Yeah, I'd say, less than a year.

01:07:00.354 --> 01:07:02.584
I'm thinking of keeping
Joe's chair empty tonight.

01:07:04.658 --> 01:07:06.626
I could put a glass in front to honor him.

01:07:09.830 --> 01:07:12.162
Or maybe I just need to let
someone sleep there.

01:07:15.703 --> 01:07:17.034
And Joe was Union cavalry.

01:07:18.439 --> 01:07:21.374
He told me once a person learns to sleep
sitting on a horse,

01:07:21.442 --> 01:07:22.910
he can sleep anywhere.

01:07:24.044 --> 01:07:26.376
Cavalry? I never knew.

01:07:28.516 --> 01:07:29.574
Well, he was.

01:07:31.552 --> 01:07:32.917
And he found a Lakota wife.

01:07:34.555 --> 01:07:36.080
Tribal family, two boys.

01:07:37.591 --> 01:07:39.423
Said they loved to trap rabbits.

01:07:43.063 --> 01:07:46.158
And he was out hunting one day
and the cavalry came by.

01:07:49.236 --> 01:07:50.726
All they saw were two boys.

01:07:52.239 --> 01:07:53.502
Two little Indian boys.

01:07:54.508 --> 01:07:55.236
No.

01:07:56.944 --> 01:08:00.505
And when he came home,
the boys were burned and strung up.

01:08:01.248 --> 01:08:02.443
And what was left of her...

01:08:08.088 --> 01:08:10.113
Well, they called it Manifest Destiny.

01:08:13.594 --> 01:08:14.584
Oh, my God.

01:08:19.033 --> 01:08:21.058
I never understood
that whole Heyoke thing.

01:08:23.036 --> 01:08:24.504
Hell, I don't think Joe did either.

01:08:26.173 --> 01:08:28.971
He said it was some Indian clown
that did everything backwards.

01:08:34.148 --> 01:08:35.912
These men like Anderson, they...

01:08:38.419 --> 01:08:40.716
they take what they want
and good people suffer.

01:08:43.791 --> 01:08:45.725
Maybe we're the ones
doing things backwards.

01:11:10.471 --> 01:11:11.461
James...

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.230
be safe.

01:12:06.026 --> 01:12:07.016
Where's the witch-whore?

01:12:07.695 --> 01:12:08.685
Sheriff?

01:12:09.396 --> 01:12:10.830
Yeah, count me in, Happy Jim.

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:27.170
Hey, Jim...

01:12:28.182 --> 01:12:29.445
if they move, you let me know.

01:12:44.565 --> 01:12:47.535
All right.
Let's get this game started, Happy Jim.

01:12:47.601 --> 01:12:50.298
There's money to be made right there.

01:12:51.138 --> 01:12:53.402
Oh, shit, sorry, Sheriff,

01:12:53.474 --> 01:12:55.203
- I got you all wet.
- It's fine.

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.278
It's fine. I said it's fine.

01:13:01.348 --> 01:13:03.407
All right,
don't get your testes in an uproar.

01:13:04.785 --> 01:13:05.581
Just deal.

01:13:06.287 --> 01:13:07.686
Cut, sir.

01:14:00.341 --> 01:14:01.706
No.

01:14:30.738 --> 01:14:32.172
The dance hall!

01:14:40.014 --> 01:14:42.176
You never know what the cards will show,
gentlemen.

01:14:42.249 --> 01:14:44.650
But they'll always have
something to teach us.

01:14:48.422 --> 01:14:50.151
Whoo!

01:15:17.051 --> 01:15:18.519
Get to Mike...

01:15:20.554 --> 01:15:21.544
now!

01:15:55.556 --> 01:15:56.990
Oh, my God. No!

01:16:03.197 --> 01:16:05.029
You're a cowardly son of a bitch.

01:16:08.903 --> 01:16:10.496
I'm gonna blow the top of your head off.

01:16:28.689 --> 01:16:30.748
Got him!

01:16:35.095 --> 01:16:36.028
I got him!

01:17:10.364 --> 01:17:11.354
Tex?

01:17:29.083 --> 01:17:30.073
Tex?

01:17:30.684 --> 01:17:32.083
- Yep, yep.
- You get him?

01:17:44.932 --> 01:17:45.922
Tex?

01:17:50.704 --> 01:17:51.694
Tex?

01:18:10.758 --> 01:18:11.748
Tex?

01:18:24.472 --> 01:18:25.462
Tex?

01:19:58.132 --> 01:19:59.725
And after all the smoke cleared...

01:20:01.301 --> 01:20:04.498
the shadow just... disappeared.

01:20:08.209 --> 01:20:11.804
Gut shot
and still alive two years later?

01:20:12.613 --> 01:20:14.103
<i>It's hard to kill a snake.</i>

01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:18.014
<i>His daddy snuck him back to Texas,</i>

01:20:18.085 --> 01:20:19.519
<i>as soon as he was healthy enough.</i>

01:20:20.154 --> 01:20:21.280
<i>Which didn't seem to matter.</i>

01:20:23.157 --> 01:20:24.921
<i>Not long after, Tim Johnston</i>

01:20:24.992 --> 01:20:27.791
<i>just happened to get killed
in a train accident.</i>

01:20:29.663 --> 01:20:33.099
<i>And then Clarence invalidated
the rest of the land claims.</i>

01:20:46.213 --> 01:20:49.114
Uh-oh.

01:20:52.987 --> 01:20:55.957
My date.

01:21:03.497 --> 01:21:04.623
Mr. Anderson...

01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:12.095
you seem to have worked up
quite an appetite.

01:21:13.007 --> 01:21:14.475
How 'bout another steak on me?

01:21:14.541 --> 01:21:15.872
Mm-mmm.

01:21:15.943 --> 01:21:17.206
My date's here.

01:21:19.513 --> 01:21:20.503
So...

01:21:24.318 --> 01:21:27.379
You must always watch the cards,
my lady friend.

01:21:28.622 --> 01:21:30.147
No matter how much you're winning,

01:21:30.224 --> 01:21:31.919
the cards will always get even...

01:21:32.993 --> 01:21:33.960
if you let them.

01:21:39.967 --> 01:21:41.025
It's time for you

01:21:41.535 --> 01:21:43.003
to stop breathing my air.

01:21:46.006 --> 01:21:46.871
James.

01:21:47.575 --> 01:21:48.565
Red.

01:22:01.755 --> 01:22:03.086
Guns or knives?

01:22:05.626 --> 01:22:06.889
What's that?

01:22:10.397 --> 01:22:11.455
Guns...

01:22:13.634 --> 01:22:14.999
or knives?

01:22:16.937 --> 01:22:17.870
Hmm.

01:22:27.548 --> 01:22:28.743
Why not a bit of both?

01:22:33.254 --> 01:22:34.653
Flinch, I dare you.

01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:38.821
I think you boys are gonna stay
right here.

01:22:39.793 --> 01:22:41.192
I'll keep an eye on 'em.

01:22:42.897 --> 01:22:43.887
Thank you, stranger.

01:22:53.307 --> 01:22:54.502
Go ahead and sit down.

01:26:14.108 --> 01:26:16.133
I suppose you boys can leave now.

01:26:18.479 --> 01:26:21.744
I know you didn't just ignore that lady
in her own place.

01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:55.711
I never did catch your name, stranger.

01:26:57.685 --> 01:26:59.517
My friends call me Mack...

01:27:00.821 --> 01:27:02.482
but my name's Arthur.

01:27:03.257 --> 01:27:04.486
Arthur McCluskie.

01:27:06.694 --> 01:27:07.684
McCluskie?

01:27:21.675 --> 01:27:23.666
I can damn sure see what he saw in you.

01:27:25.346 --> 01:27:26.336
Who?

01:27:28.015 --> 01:27:29.005
My brother.

01:27:32.653 --> 01:27:34.621
I guess I knew only partial.

01:27:36.757 --> 01:27:37.781
Fact is...

01:27:39.059 --> 01:27:40.493
I hadn't seen him for years.

01:27:42.796 --> 01:27:45.629
Pockets would float back to me
from time to time, but...

01:27:47.935 --> 01:27:50.267
You know, Mike,
he was just always so damn...

01:27:51.772 --> 01:27:52.762
distant.

01:27:56.811 --> 01:27:59.280
But if you can find solace in this...

01:28:00.781 --> 01:28:01.976
I can tell you one thing.

01:28:08.022 --> 01:28:10.081
He damn sure liked him a redhead.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.390
Well, Mack...

01:28:22.436 --> 01:28:26.339
I do believe the next story
is definitely yours.
