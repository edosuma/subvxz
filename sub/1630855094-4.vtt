00:10.314 --> 00:11.359
<i>Previously on</i> From...

00:11.489 --> 00:12.403
I hear their voices.

00:12.534 --> 00:15.015
Sara, just tell me
what you did.

00:15.145 --> 00:17.539
I left the door open.

00:17.669 --> 00:19.976
I have Sara tied up in
the basement of the church.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.282
Tell me you're joking.

00:21.412 --> 00:23.501
That girl may be the key to
unlocking all this.

00:23.632 --> 00:26.765
That girl may be
the way we all go home.

00:26.896 --> 00:28.680
Let's take a walk.

00:28.811 --> 00:29.681
We have to turn around!

00:29.812 --> 00:31.509
We can't be here!
Stop the bus!

00:31.640 --> 00:33.076
Everyone lease return
to your seats!

00:33.207 --> 00:34.643
Bad things are gonna
happen if--

00:36.775 --> 00:37.689
Stop the goddamn bus!

00:37.820 --> 00:39.517
Everyone on, right now.

00:39.648 --> 00:41.519
You're gonna get people killed,
you realize that?

00:41.650 --> 00:42.390
<i>Hello?</i>

00:42.520 --> 00:44.000
Where are you?

00:44.131 --> 00:46.263
<i>Is this Jim?</i>

00:46.394 --> 00:48.483
<i>Your wife shouldn't be
digging that hole, Jim.</i>

00:54.184 --> 00:57.405
You ever wonder
if Abby was right?

00:57.535 --> 00:59.363
What if it's all
just a dream?

01:00.582 --> 01:01.452
Aah!

01:03.498 --> 01:05.717
My blood is your blood now.

01:05.848 --> 01:07.197
Who was in my room?

01:07.328 --> 01:08.633
- Sorry?
- Someone was in my room,

01:08.764 --> 01:10.113
and they took something.

01:10.244 --> 01:11.375
Uh, I think I saw Jade

01:11.506 --> 01:12.724
and the Matthews boy
up here last night.

01:12.855 --> 01:13.682
You are not
listening to me.

01:13.812 --> 01:14.726
No, I am listening,

01:14.857 --> 01:16.250
and I'm telling you
to fuck off.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.643
Residents don't carry guns.
That's the rule.

01:18.774 --> 01:22.256
Well, uh, rules change.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.301
The wires aren't
connected to anything.

01:24.432 --> 01:26.390
They were just dangling
from the ceiling.

01:26.521 --> 01:29.350
Tabitha, we have
so much to talk about.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.308
I saw something
that wasn't there.

01:31.439 --> 01:32.222
What?

01:32.353 --> 01:33.745
I saw two children

01:33.876 --> 01:36.835
standing in the middle
of the road staring at me.

01:38.707 --> 01:40.709
Hello? Someone down here?

01:45.235 --> 01:46.541
Hi, Kenny.

01:51.894 --> 01:54.723
And right through here
we have the common area.

01:55.724 --> 01:59.249
And downstairs you'll have
a nice big room all to yourself.

01:59.380 --> 02:00.424
Come on in.

02:03.427 --> 02:04.689
No.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.388
I don't like it here.

02:07.518 --> 02:08.650
It's too sunny.

02:08.780 --> 02:11.218
I-I want to go home.

02:11.348 --> 02:12.915
No, no, Dad.
It's okay, look.

02:13.045 --> 02:14.743
Um, this place
is really nice.

02:14.873 --> 02:17.267
And, look, there's
a perfect little spot here

02:17.398 --> 02:19.226
for us to play chess.

02:19.356 --> 02:21.924
We stay here together?

02:24.361 --> 02:27.277
I'll give you folks
a few minutes, okay?

02:27.408 --> 02:28.713
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

02:38.593 --> 02:40.334
Look, Dad.

02:40.464 --> 02:43.206
Mom and I are gonna
be right down the street.

02:43.337 --> 02:47.297
You know? And we'll
come here every single day.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.560
But it's really, really
important for you

02:49.691 --> 02:52.433
to be somewhere where you
can't open the door at night.

02:55.784 --> 02:56.959
Dad, what happened last night...

02:58.700 --> 03:00.397
It's safer this way.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.575
No.

03:04.706 --> 03:05.707
I go home now.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.645
Uh, I'll go get
the rest of the stuff.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.752
Kenny.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.580
Sheriff Boyd, hey.

03:52.710 --> 03:53.842
Everything all right?

03:55.931 --> 03:59.239
Yeah, we were just, uh,
we're getting my dad settled in.

03:59.369 --> 04:00.762
I heard you had
a scare last night.

04:03.547 --> 04:05.288
Those things were knocking
on the door, they're--

04:06.898 --> 04:09.727
He was convinced that, uh,

04:09.858 --> 04:11.381
that his brothers
were outside.

04:11.512 --> 04:12.817
Right.

04:12.948 --> 04:15.994
My mom tried to stop him
but, uh, he-- he pushed her.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.997
It was, uh...

04:19.128 --> 04:20.695
Yeah, man, it's--

04:22.523 --> 04:23.437
It's hard.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.875
First time seeing
your parents struggle, huh?

04:29.356 --> 04:30.531
Yeah.

04:31.662 --> 04:32.707
You know, this place...

04:34.535 --> 04:36.406
...there's not a lot
holding it together.

04:37.146 --> 04:39.757
You know,
everyone is scared and confused,

04:39.888 --> 04:42.499
but a thing
I learned in the army,

04:42.630 --> 04:44.806
it always helps to
have people to look to--

04:44.936 --> 04:48.026
people who seem like they know
what the hell they're doing.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.724
That's really all
I'm trying to do here.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.856
Seems like you're doing
a really good job.

04:54.468 --> 04:56.774
I could use some help.

04:56.905 --> 04:59.081
Wouldn't mind having
a deputy watching my six.

05:02.127 --> 05:03.433
What do you say?

05:05.043 --> 05:06.480
You think?

05:07.872 --> 05:09.570
I think, right?

05:09.700 --> 05:11.006
Uh, yeah.

05:11.136 --> 05:12.094
I mean--

05:16.664 --> 05:17.621
Sheriff Boyd!

05:19.971 --> 05:20.972
I have to show you something.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.409
Can it wait?
I gotta--

05:22.539 --> 05:23.975
No, no, no.

05:24.106 --> 05:27.065
Um, I have--
I have to show you now.

Hey, I was gonna
make some tea.

07:38.675 --> 07:39.633
You want some?

07:41.983 --> 07:42.897
Are you okay?

07:43.027 --> 07:43.941
Hey.

07:45.682 --> 07:48.119
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:48.250 --> 07:51.122
It happened again, didn't it?

07:51.253 --> 07:52.254
You saw something.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.562
I need you to watch
Ethan for a minute.

07:55.692 --> 07:56.998
I need to talk to your father.

07:58.260 --> 08:01.045
Mom, you can tell me.

08:03.744 --> 08:06.050
I know. I know.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.794
Yes, it happened again.

08:10.925 --> 08:13.884
I saw something,
but, listen, I'm fine.

08:14.015 --> 08:16.626
And you're fine, right?

08:16.757 --> 08:17.845
- We're good.
- Yeah.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.587
I just need to talk to Daddy.

08:23.111 --> 08:24.155
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.511
I'll be right back.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.954
Where's Mom going?

08:40.084 --> 08:41.085
Uh, she--

08:41.216 --> 08:43.174
Oh, Christ!

08:43.305 --> 08:44.611
Are you people
living here now?

08:44.741 --> 08:46.917
Our house collapsed.

08:47.048 --> 08:49.006
Well...
at least you had one.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.181
It's not my fault you broke it.

08:50.312 --> 08:51.792
Hey, take it easy.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.707
We finally get rid of
those three smelly hippies

08:53.837 --> 08:55.622
from Colony House
and now we got you people!

09:00.322 --> 09:01.584
Still wanna go see Victor?

09:01.715 --> 09:03.281
Yeah.

09:09.331 --> 09:10.724
When I came down earlier...

09:13.814 --> 09:14.902
...she was here.

09:32.354 --> 09:34.138
Give us a minute, okay?

09:36.401 --> 09:37.577
What?

09:37.707 --> 09:38.752
I need to talk to her.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.017
In private.
Wait for me upstairs.

09:44.192 --> 09:46.107
Please, Kenny.

09:46.237 --> 09:47.282
I got this.

09:52.026 --> 09:52.983
All right.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.248
All right.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.740
I'm glad you're okay.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.350
Yeah, that's debatable.

10:12.481 --> 10:16.180
I got about a thousand
questions for you.

10:16.311 --> 10:17.834
What happened to you?

10:17.965 --> 10:20.097
After you pushed me
in that tree?

10:20.228 --> 10:21.795
Where'd you go?

10:21.925 --> 10:23.753
I followed right behind you.

10:23.884 --> 10:25.233
And?

10:25.363 --> 10:27.148
And then I was here.

10:28.323 --> 10:29.759
So you--

10:30.412 --> 10:31.935
You been here since
the other night?

10:32.066 --> 10:34.634
I didn't know what else to do.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.070
Where did you go
when you went through?

10:36.200 --> 10:37.419
That's a...

10:39.900 --> 10:40.988
How did you know?

10:41.118 --> 10:43.164
How'd you know
what that tree was?

10:45.296 --> 10:46.907
A little boy told me.

10:47.037 --> 10:49.779
He was standing up on the ridge,
wearing all white.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.085
He said that Nathan was right,

10:51.215 --> 10:53.000
that we made
this place angry,

10:53.130 --> 10:55.437
but we'd be safe
in the tree.

10:56.264 --> 10:58.396
So, this little boy, that's one
of the voices you hear.

10:58.527 --> 11:01.051
No.

11:01.182 --> 11:02.313
No, this was different.

11:02.444 --> 11:03.967
- I think--
- Jesus.

11:04.098 --> 11:05.882
I think he's trapped here
like us,

11:06.013 --> 11:08.406
that he wants to help,
but he's not sure how.

11:08.537 --> 11:09.756
No shit.

11:10.931 --> 11:15.239
Look, I am glad
you're back.

11:15.370 --> 11:18.199
I am. I am.

11:18.329 --> 11:20.680
But you being here,

11:20.810 --> 11:22.290
that's a shitstorm
waitin' to happen.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.379
We need to figure out
how to handle this.

11:24.509 --> 11:27.121
You know
what you have to do.

11:28.470 --> 11:29.863
We're not talkin'
about this.

11:29.993 --> 11:33.475
Boyd, it was always
going to end like this.

11:33.605 --> 11:35.390
You knew that when
you brought me out there.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.741
There's no way I can
ever live here again.

11:38.872 --> 11:40.395
Hey.

11:40.525 --> 11:42.745
Just sit tight, okay?

11:42.876 --> 11:44.834
I gotta talk
to Kenny.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.401
Just sit tight.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.059
Boyd?

11:54.583 --> 11:57.455
You didn't tell Kenny,

11:57.586 --> 11:59.806
'bout what happened
that night at the clinic.

12:02.896 --> 12:03.810
No.

12:18.259 --> 12:20.348
What is going on?

12:20.478 --> 12:22.872
Look.

12:23.003 --> 12:25.440
Now, I'm just gonna say
this as plainly as I can.

12:25.570 --> 12:29.487
Okay, Sara is uniquely

12:29.618 --> 12:31.489
connected to this place.

12:31.620 --> 12:34.057
Something here has
communicated with her.

12:34.188 --> 12:35.232
Communicated how?

12:35.363 --> 12:36.799
She hears voices.

12:36.930 --> 12:39.933
Ye-- I know,
I know how it sounds.

12:40.063 --> 12:41.761
Believe me.
When Father Khatri came to me--

12:41.891 --> 12:43.066
Father Khatri knew?

12:43.980 --> 12:46.853
Father Khatri
locked her up in the basement.

12:46.983 --> 12:48.245
Apparently Nathan had come
to him

12:48.376 --> 12:49.943
earlier in the day,
he was worried.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.075
Thought she might do
something to hurt someone.

12:52.206 --> 12:54.208
So, Father Khatri
questioned her,

12:54.338 --> 12:56.253
and what he found proof of

12:56.384 --> 12:58.255
is that something here
is talking to her.

12:59.430 --> 13:02.042
Using her like-- like--

13:02.172 --> 13:03.130
A pawn.

13:05.262 --> 13:08.962
He figured if something
here is using her,

13:09.092 --> 13:10.920
if she really is
connected to this place,

13:11.051 --> 13:13.923
then we can
use that to understand

13:14.054 --> 13:16.056
what this place actually is.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.975
Okay, I don't-- So, what?

13:22.105 --> 13:24.194
She's just been downstairs
since Father Khatri died?

13:25.543 --> 13:26.588
No.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.243
I took her with me
into the forest.

13:31.027 --> 13:31.941
Jesus, I--

13:33.160 --> 13:34.552
Look, hey,
when push came to shove,

13:34.683 --> 13:36.293
she's the reason I made it back.

13:36.424 --> 13:38.600
That girl downstairs
saved my life,

13:38.730 --> 13:41.255
and I know,
I know she did bad things.

13:41.385 --> 13:42.996
Horrible things!

13:43.126 --> 13:45.259
But this place, Kenny,

13:45.389 --> 13:48.436
it can make you think you're
doing them for good reasons.

13:48.566 --> 13:51.308
She killed her own brother!

13:51.439 --> 13:53.310
She tried to kill
a 9-year-old kid!

13:53.441 --> 13:54.398
Yes, I know!

13:54.529 --> 13:56.096
Do you? Because you lied.

13:56.226 --> 13:57.314
You lied to everyone!

13:57.445 --> 13:58.576
You lied to me!

13:58.707 --> 14:00.317
Yeah, okay, okay.

14:00.448 --> 14:02.102
Okay, you're right.

14:02.232 --> 14:04.974
And I know that what
she did is unforgivable,

14:05.105 --> 14:06.541
but, listen, when she
killed those people--

14:06.671 --> 14:08.935
People?

14:09.065 --> 14:10.066
It was just Nathan.

14:10.197 --> 14:12.286
No, I mean, yeah.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.592
She almost with the--
with Ethan--

14:14.723 --> 14:17.117
You know what
I'm talking about, right?

14:17.247 --> 14:18.292
Kenny!

14:21.948 --> 14:23.340
Boyd.

14:23.471 --> 14:26.169
What's gonna happen
when everyone finds out?

14:26.300 --> 14:27.605
When Jim and Tabitha

14:27.736 --> 14:29.259
and Ethan's
whole family finds out?

14:29.390 --> 14:30.870
Yeah, okay. Well...

14:33.089 --> 14:34.264
- We'll handle it.
- She's dangerous.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.179
Boyd, she belongs in the Box.

14:36.310 --> 14:39.139
Okay, well,
she's not dangerous.

14:39.269 --> 14:40.357
Not anymore.

14:40.488 --> 14:42.142
Okay, would you
still be saying this

14:42.272 --> 14:43.883
if it was Ellis that
she almost killed?

14:44.013 --> 14:45.058
She's not goin' in the Box.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.668
If we really wanna
figure this out--

14:46.798 --> 14:49.105
Hey, she's not going
in the goddamn Box, okay!?

14:49.236 --> 14:53.240
No one else is going
in-- into the fucking Box!

14:53.370 --> 14:57.200
Oh, okay.

14:57.331 --> 15:00.943
I, uh... I-I-I need some air.

15:01.074 --> 15:01.988
I gotta...

15:02.118 --> 15:02.989
Boyd!

15:16.176 --> 15:17.090
Boyd.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.094
I can't--

15:21.224 --> 15:23.574
Boyd! Boyd! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey!

15:23.705 --> 15:26.316
Hey! You okay?

15:26.447 --> 15:27.361
Guys, come on!

15:27.491 --> 15:29.493
Jeez!

15:33.541 --> 15:34.542
Hey.

15:34.672 --> 15:35.717
Hey, slow down.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.294
Not too long, okay?

15:47.424 --> 15:48.425
Okay.

15:52.690 --> 15:54.083
Hey, you.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.391
Guess it's laundry day?

15:57.521 --> 16:00.176
I'm just trying to get things
back to some sense of normal.

16:02.439 --> 16:05.138
I never got to congratulate
you on the engagement.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.314
- Oh.
- I'm really happy for you guys.

16:07.444 --> 16:10.621
Well, in that case,
maybe you'd consider

16:10.752 --> 16:12.667
being one of
my bridesmaids.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.103
What?

16:14.234 --> 16:15.539
Ellis doesn't wanna wait.

16:15.670 --> 16:16.627
We're gonna--

16:18.586 --> 16:20.501
We're getting
married here.

16:20.631 --> 16:23.112
Oh my God. Seriously?

16:23.243 --> 16:24.461
Right?

16:24.592 --> 16:26.028
But I mean, it's--

16:27.595 --> 16:31.468
Well, I would be honored
to be one of your bridesmaids.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.383
Why, thank you kindly.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.256
I saw the new guy outside.

16:36.386 --> 16:39.650
Elgin, yeah, he's, uh--

16:39.781 --> 16:41.217
I think he's having
a rough time.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.394
Maybe I could talk to him?

16:45.830 --> 16:46.701
Really?

16:46.831 --> 16:48.790
Yeah.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.618
It was nice having
people do it for me.

17:07.504 --> 17:08.549
Hi.

17:10.116 --> 17:11.291
What do you want?

17:12.640 --> 17:14.468
I was worried
about you.

17:14.598 --> 17:15.991
I'm glad you're okay.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.819
Well, I'm not very
happy with you.

17:19.299 --> 17:21.170
Can I come in?

17:21.301 --> 17:22.345
I don't know.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.565
Are you gonna
steal anything else?

17:24.695 --> 17:25.696
I told him not to.

17:25.827 --> 17:27.133
I said you wouldn't like it.

17:27.263 --> 17:29.831
Well, you should've
said it louder.

17:38.883 --> 17:40.494
My mom said
you helped her.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.322
Out in the forest.

17:43.497 --> 17:44.846
She's a nice lady.

17:44.976 --> 17:47.327
You're lucky to
have a mom like that.

17:49.503 --> 17:50.678
What are you drawing?

17:50.808 --> 17:52.245
New stuff.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.463
What kind of new stuff?

17:53.594 --> 17:54.682
Things we saw.

17:56.292 --> 17:57.337
You and my mom?

17:57.467 --> 17:58.686
Yeah. Yeah.

18:00.514 --> 18:01.732
Where did you guys go?

18:01.863 --> 18:03.647
You should go now,

18:03.778 --> 18:05.780
'cause I'm pretty busy.

18:07.303 --> 18:08.435
Well...

18:08.565 --> 18:10.654
Please just go!

18:14.571 --> 18:17.226
I found these in
the storage closet.

18:17.357 --> 18:18.488
I thought you might like them.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.547
I'm sorry I made you mad.

18:37.464 --> 18:38.552
Okay.

18:41.337 --> 18:42.382
Bye.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.087
Hey.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.480
You're Elgin, right?

18:55.395 --> 18:56.570
Yeah. Julie?

18:56.700 --> 18:57.701
Yeah.

18:59.573 --> 19:00.617
How's your dad?

19:02.532 --> 19:03.751
Uh, he's pretty beat up.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.668
Kristi, the doctor,
she's trying to get him

19:07.798 --> 19:09.626
to take it easy for a bit.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.676
You been here a while?

19:15.806 --> 19:18.287
Uh, not that long.

19:18.418 --> 19:19.854
Kinda feels
like a lifetime.

19:25.642 --> 19:28.210
Look, I know you probably have

19:28.341 --> 19:30.908
tons of people telling you
they're here if you wanna talk,

19:31.039 --> 19:35.304
but I'm around
if you wanna talk.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.437
Believe it or not,
it actually helps.

19:38.742 --> 19:39.787
I appreciate that.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.226
Hey, what's going on?
I thought you--

19:44.357 --> 19:45.227
I wanna go home.

19:45.358 --> 19:47.273
Okay, well, ca--

19:52.321 --> 19:53.409
I think that's my cue.

19:54.541 --> 19:55.933
It was nice meeting you.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.239
Likewise.

19:58.893 --> 19:59.937
Hey!

20:01.330 --> 20:02.375
Ethan, wait up.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.204
Good.

20:05.334 --> 20:06.901
And then we'll
do the other hand.

20:07.031 --> 20:08.468
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

20:08.598 --> 20:10.948
I'm just tired, that's all.

20:11.079 --> 20:12.689
Oh, given your
vast medical training

20:12.820 --> 20:14.822
I guess there's nothing
to worry about, then.

20:18.478 --> 20:20.349
Now press up as hard as you can.

20:21.524 --> 20:23.222
Good.

20:23.352 --> 20:24.788
What about spider bites?

20:24.919 --> 20:27.835
I got spiders on me
when I was out in the forest.

20:27.965 --> 20:29.880
Uh, yeah.
Let me take a look.

20:31.491 --> 20:32.666
Let's see.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.885
- There's one here.
- Okay.

20:35.016 --> 20:36.887
And then there's...

20:37.801 --> 20:41.457
They don't look swollen
or inflamed, which is good.

20:41.588 --> 20:44.373
Uh, but do you wanna
tell me about this?

20:44.504 --> 20:46.375
What? It's nothing. I just--

20:46.506 --> 20:47.550
Boyd!

20:47.681 --> 20:49.813
I just scratched it
on a tree branch.

20:53.426 --> 20:55.384
It's, um...
it's not infected,

20:55.515 --> 20:56.907
but keep it clean, okay?

20:57.038 --> 20:58.039
Yes, ma'am.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.393
Those tremors,
have they gotten any worse?

21:04.524 --> 21:05.916
They come and go.
I'm dealing with it.

21:06.047 --> 21:08.615
Have you noticed any
symptoms other than the shaking?

21:08.745 --> 21:09.920
Such as?

21:10.051 --> 21:12.271
Visual impairment,
muscle stiffness--

21:12.401 --> 21:13.402
- Nope.
- Depression?

21:14.882 --> 21:16.710
Kristi, everybody here
is depressed.

21:20.061 --> 21:22.890
You know, I remember my--
my dad, he got--

21:23.673 --> 21:26.328
It started to mess
with his mind at the end.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.025
Yeah, I don't think that's
anything that you need

21:28.156 --> 21:29.766
to be worrying about right now.

21:29.897 --> 21:31.638
Cognitive impairment
with Parkinson's

21:31.768 --> 21:34.815
doesn't happen until way
down the line, if at all.

21:34.945 --> 21:37.426
Why? Is there something?

21:37.557 --> 21:38.906
No. Just-- Just curious.

21:39.036 --> 21:41.430
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

21:41.561 --> 21:42.475
Fine.

21:43.737 --> 21:45.478
Okay, but you need
to rest, okay?

21:45.608 --> 21:47.088
In your condition,
you can't afford to be

21:47.218 --> 21:48.872
putting any extra stress
on your body right now.

21:56.880 --> 21:57.968
Boyd, what's going on?

21:58.099 --> 21:59.927
Nothing! I'm sorry.

22:01.189 --> 22:04.323
The idea that
anybody here could avoid

22:04.453 --> 22:06.629
putting extra stress
on anything is just--

22:06.760 --> 22:10.851
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

22:14.071 --> 22:15.334
This is great.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.727
Uh, not a good idea. Okay.

22:17.858 --> 22:19.990
- Just sit, okay?
- Come on!

23:33.934 --> 23:36.066
For fuck's sake,
there's literally nowhere

23:36.197 --> 23:37.503
in this town I can be alone.

23:39.069 --> 23:41.594
Wait a second.
You're the bus driver, right?

23:43.857 --> 23:45.772
I'm sorry.
It's been a long day.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.077
Stay as long
as you want, all right?

23:47.208 --> 23:48.427
I'm just gonna...

23:54.302 --> 23:55.608
That boy.

23:58.175 --> 24:00.526
He said to me,
"Turn around."

24:02.702 --> 24:03.659
He begged me.

24:05.182 --> 24:06.227
I didn't listen.

24:12.059 --> 24:13.495
When?

24:15.845 --> 24:16.890
What?

24:19.675 --> 24:20.807
When did he ask you
to turn the bus around?

24:22.243 --> 24:24.158
Was it before
or after you saw the tree?

24:25.768 --> 24:26.726
After.

24:28.249 --> 24:31.078
Oh, well, then
you were already screwed.

24:32.862 --> 24:34.473
Apparently,
it's once you see the tree,

24:34.603 --> 24:36.213
that's when everything,
you know.

24:38.085 --> 24:39.826
Yeah, I wouldn't
spend too much time

24:39.956 --> 24:41.480
kicking yourself
for that part.

24:42.959 --> 24:45.048
Those people.

24:45.179 --> 24:47.703
They got on my bus.

24:47.834 --> 24:49.792
It was my job to get them
where they were going.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.098
All right,
tell me something.

24:51.228 --> 24:54.710
Does your pity party
come with music? Hm?

24:54.841 --> 24:57.234
Will you be serving
finger sandwiches?

24:57.365 --> 24:59.106
Look, it's not
your fault!

24:59.236 --> 25:00.281
Okay?

25:01.848 --> 25:03.676
I mean, if you wanna
feel like shit, fine,

25:03.806 --> 25:08.594
but feel like shit
'cause <i>your</i> life is fucked.

25:08.724 --> 25:10.160
Don't carry around
a bunch of guilt thinking

25:10.291 --> 25:11.640
that you ruined
anybody else's.

25:11.771 --> 25:14.513
Besides, no offense...

25:15.775 --> 25:16.950
...they were riding a bus.

25:18.778 --> 25:20.606
Their lives couldn't have been
that great to begin with.

25:23.696 --> 25:25.045
It was a bad joke. Sorry.

25:34.968 --> 25:37.318
You know I wasn't even
supposed to be driving that day?

25:39.668 --> 25:41.931
I took that job
to pay for my degree.

25:44.194 --> 25:46.327
Last month I finally
paid off my tuition.

25:48.329 --> 25:51.506
I was all set to hand in
my notice and I thought,

25:51.637 --> 25:54.074
why not stay a few extra weeks?

25:54.204 --> 25:56.946
Put aside something extra
so I can treat myself.

25:58.339 --> 26:00.994
Take a little trip
and celebrate.

26:02.430 --> 26:05.651
I deserve
a little reward, right?

26:08.654 --> 26:10.090
Is this what I deserve?

26:16.749 --> 26:18.620
I sold my company
right before I got here.

26:21.231 --> 26:23.756
Finally achieved the one thing
I worked my whole life for.

26:27.890 --> 26:29.196
To getting what
we deserve.

26:36.116 --> 26:37.857
Mm.

26:39.336 --> 26:41.034
Ah, it doesn't get easier.

26:41.164 --> 26:42.122
Yeah.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.084
Jim?

27:08.452 --> 27:10.237
Hi.

27:10.367 --> 27:11.804
Hey.

27:11.934 --> 27:13.414
I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you come in.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.678
Who are you?

27:16.809 --> 27:18.680
I'm Marielle.
I was on the bus.

27:18.811 --> 27:21.291
Oh.

27:21.422 --> 27:22.815
Don't worry, I'm a nurse.

27:22.945 --> 27:26.079
I was just helping
Kristi inventory the supplies.

27:27.515 --> 27:29.212
Um, I'm looking for my husband?

27:29.343 --> 27:31.127
Jim?

27:31.258 --> 27:33.042
He left a little while ago.

27:34.870 --> 27:35.915
Thank you.

27:40.223 --> 27:41.268
This go other storage.

27:41.398 --> 27:42.443
Okay.

27:45.141 --> 27:46.752
Jim.

27:46.882 --> 27:48.754
What are you doing, honey?
You should be resting.

27:50.103 --> 27:51.887
We need to talk.

27:52.018 --> 27:53.106
Okay.

27:53.236 --> 27:54.760
Over here.

27:54.890 --> 27:57.763
Take, take more.
Take more. Yeah.

27:59.025 --> 28:00.156
Jesus.

28:04.813 --> 28:07.729
I laid down there all night
thinking I was gonna die,

28:07.860 --> 28:09.992
and I just kept
asking myself "why?"

28:11.864 --> 28:13.735
Why did that road
lead us here?

28:13.866 --> 28:16.433
What the fuck is
the point of all of this?

28:16.564 --> 28:19.045
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you can't just take this stuff!

28:19.175 --> 28:20.307
It doesn't belong to you!

28:20.437 --> 28:22.135
Hey! You go! Now!

28:23.440 --> 28:24.354
Fucking people.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.359
Fucking vultures.

28:29.490 --> 28:31.971
Did you know Kristi's
fiancée was on that bus?

28:33.059 --> 28:33.929
What?

28:34.060 --> 28:36.018
Yeah.

28:36.149 --> 28:38.717
And what you said about
the wires not being connected?

28:38.847 --> 28:39.805
That's not possible.

28:39.935 --> 28:41.110
No, no,
I'm telling you--

28:41.241 --> 28:44.026
Oh, no, it's not that.
I know, I believe you.

28:45.549 --> 28:49.162
It's just that there
is no way that...

28:51.425 --> 28:54.515
When we build
a new rollercoaster,

28:54.645 --> 28:57.692
we design it to do things
that seem impossible,

28:57.823 --> 28:59.346
because the more
impossible it seems,

28:59.476 --> 29:02.175
the stronger the reaction you
get from the people riding it.

29:03.959 --> 29:06.048
I know how this sounds,
but what if...

29:07.006 --> 29:11.532
...what if all this was designed
just to see how we react?

29:12.533 --> 29:16.319
I mean, what if this is all some
kind of fucked-up experiment?

29:20.106 --> 29:21.411
The radio worked.

29:24.501 --> 29:25.459
No.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.417
We made contact with someone.

29:27.548 --> 29:29.245
So, then why is
everybody just standing--

29:29.376 --> 29:30.420
'Cause they don't know.

29:33.075 --> 29:34.424
Right as the storm
was coming in,

29:34.555 --> 29:36.165
just as we were about
to wrap things up,

29:36.296 --> 29:38.820
I heard a voice. A man.

29:38.951 --> 29:41.257
That's why I came
running back here.

29:41.388 --> 29:43.085
He-he warned me, Tabitha.

29:43.216 --> 29:46.349
Or threatened me.
I don't know which,

29:46.480 --> 29:48.351
but he knew my name,

29:48.482 --> 29:50.092
and he said
you shouldn't be digging,

29:50.223 --> 29:52.573
and then just like that,
our house collapsed.

29:54.575 --> 29:56.969
You think someone's
watching us?

29:57.099 --> 29:57.970
All I know is--

29:58.100 --> 29:59.580
Honey.

30:02.148 --> 30:04.411
All I know is

30:04.541 --> 30:06.282
someone got on
the other end of that radio

30:06.413 --> 30:07.501
and they talked to me.

30:08.981 --> 30:09.895
Over there.

30:11.592 --> 30:13.246
Did anyone else hear it?

30:14.900 --> 30:16.379
The voice on the radio?

30:34.528 --> 30:35.964
It's your move, Boyd...

30:37.966 --> 30:39.402
but I gotta say...

30:41.274 --> 30:42.884
your options
don't look great.

30:45.321 --> 30:46.322
This ain't real.

30:48.672 --> 30:50.196
You're not here.

30:51.197 --> 30:53.329
You wanna talk about
what can and can't be real?

30:53.460 --> 30:55.070
That's the part
you wanna focus on?

30:57.551 --> 30:59.553
Yeah, I don't know.

30:59.683 --> 31:01.598
I got a little mystery boy

31:01.729 --> 31:04.558
sending people through
magic trees in the forest,

31:04.688 --> 31:06.255
my hand's
not shaking anymore,

31:06.386 --> 31:08.518
but now I got fucking worms
underneath my skin.

31:08.649 --> 31:11.652
So, yeah, yeah, maybe that's
the part we should talk about!

31:14.698 --> 31:18.224
Or... how 'bout we talk about
what's really on your mind?

31:21.009 --> 31:24.447
How exactly are you gonna tell
Kenny that Sara killed his dad?

31:24.578 --> 31:26.536
She didn't kill him.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.887
She opened the door.
Potato, pot-ah-to.

31:29.017 --> 31:30.366
You think Kenny's gonna
be interested

31:30.497 --> 31:31.977
in the minutiae of exactly
what happened?

31:37.025 --> 31:38.070
Let me ask you something.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.075
What benefit is there
in Kenny knowing?

31:45.033 --> 31:46.948
That you lied to him.
You betrayed him.

31:47.079 --> 31:48.471
- I didn't--
- You found out the truth

31:48.602 --> 31:50.691
about how his father died.
You not only spared the life

31:50.821 --> 31:52.911
of the person responsible,
you gave her your trust,

31:53.041 --> 31:54.042
your friendship.

31:54.173 --> 31:55.914
All this was
your fuckin' idea!

31:56.044 --> 31:59.395
Oh, come on, Boyd. Really?

31:59.526 --> 32:01.484
It's poor form
to blame the dead.

32:03.269 --> 32:05.053
He'll understand.

32:05.184 --> 32:06.402
I did what I had to do.

32:06.533 --> 32:07.577
She was valuable!

32:07.708 --> 32:09.579
She--
She may still be valuable!

32:09.710 --> 32:14.106
Oh, yeah,
she may very well be of value.

32:14.236 --> 32:17.936
Which is why you need to
keep your fucking mouth shut.

32:18.066 --> 32:20.634
I mean, of what value is
the truth to Kenny right now?

32:20.764 --> 32:23.071
What, you think he's gonna be
better off once he finds out?

32:23.202 --> 32:26.118
Or will you simply be relieving
the burden of your own guilt?

32:28.163 --> 32:30.513
Oh, man.

32:30.644 --> 32:33.516
Somehow you being dead
made you more of an asshole.

32:33.647 --> 32:36.432
Leaders sometimes have to
make tough decisions, Boyd.

32:36.563 --> 32:38.217
You of all people know this.

32:38.347 --> 32:39.740
What, you wanna be
everyone's friend?

32:39.870 --> 32:42.221
Go be the new bartender.
Apparently there's a vacancy.

32:42.351 --> 32:44.440
But if you wanna
lead these people home,

32:44.571 --> 32:47.443
sometimes you have to
make a shitty decision.

32:48.270 --> 32:50.577
I tried telling you this before,
you didn't listen.

32:50.707 --> 32:52.231
Listen to me now.

32:55.408 --> 32:56.670
I'm not gonna lie to him.

32:59.412 --> 33:01.283
What was that thing Ellis said?

33:03.807 --> 33:06.419
'Bout that thing
that everyone holds onto?

33:10.771 --> 33:12.164
That's what you are
to Kenny now.

33:14.427 --> 33:18.083
You're the father
Kenny no longer has.

33:19.606 --> 33:21.738
What do you think happens
when you take that away?

33:24.263 --> 33:26.613
Broken people don't
survive here, Boyd.

33:28.615 --> 33:29.964
It's not a good time, Jim.

33:30.095 --> 33:31.270
You know why I'm here.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.489
To thank me for
looking after your kids

33:33.620 --> 33:36.057
when you ran off
like an asshole?

33:36.188 --> 33:38.277
We need to talk about
how we're gonna handle this.

33:38.407 --> 33:40.148
Handle what?

33:40.279 --> 33:41.976
You heard the voice
on the radio.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.499
I know you did.

33:48.896 --> 33:50.158
Get the fuck in here.

34:03.824 --> 34:06.696
I'm gonna put this
as delicately as possible.

34:06.827 --> 34:09.743
How fucking stupid are you?

34:11.136 --> 34:12.267
What?

34:12.398 --> 34:14.139
You wanna know if
I heard something?

34:14.269 --> 34:15.531
Yeah, I heard it.

34:15.662 --> 34:17.751
I heard
some spooky motherfucker

34:17.881 --> 34:19.187
warn you about your wife

34:19.318 --> 34:22.451
20 minutes before
your house collapsed.

34:22.582 --> 34:27.413
That means that there are
people out there who can see us.

34:27.543 --> 34:31.721
And what part of you
thinks that that's a good sign?

34:32.679 --> 34:35.508
Do you realize what happened
here after you ran off?

34:35.638 --> 34:38.250
The fucking lights exploded.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.600
One of my people
almost went blind.

34:40.730 --> 34:42.819
If there really
are people watching us,

34:42.950 --> 34:45.257
they sure as shit
aren't helping us.

34:45.387 --> 34:46.780
What do you think
they'll do if they find out

34:46.910 --> 34:49.174
we know about them? Huh?

34:49.304 --> 34:52.090
And that's assuming
it was actually a person

34:52.220 --> 34:53.656
on the other end
of the line.

34:55.832 --> 34:58.705
There are things
around here that walk

34:58.835 --> 35:00.794
and talk just like us,

35:00.924 --> 35:04.537
until they walk up to you
and rip your fucking guts out.

35:06.452 --> 35:07.888
How do you know
it wasn't one of them?

35:09.542 --> 35:12.545
- I--
- I am not saying ignore it.

35:14.721 --> 35:16.462
But you already
got people's hopes up

35:16.592 --> 35:17.724
with your goddamn tower.

35:17.854 --> 35:19.595
All the more reason--

35:19.726 --> 35:21.597
To keep our fucking
mouths shut.

35:22.685 --> 35:24.339
Until we know more.

35:27.777 --> 35:29.301
Where's the radio?

35:30.998 --> 35:32.652
What?

35:32.782 --> 35:34.175
What happened to the radio?

35:38.397 --> 35:40.486
It's in the back.

35:40.616 --> 35:42.836
It got a little
busted up during the storm.

35:42.966 --> 35:44.794
All right.

35:44.925 --> 35:47.667
Do me a favor and don't do
anything until I tell you--

35:47.797 --> 35:49.756
Hey!
What the fuck are you doing?

35:49.886 --> 35:51.236
Oh, fuck.

35:51.366 --> 35:52.498
- Hey, calm down.
- Fuck!

35:52.628 --> 35:54.239
Don't tell me to
fucking calm down!

35:57.764 --> 35:59.113
You don't touch my shit!

35:59.244 --> 36:00.549
Understand me?

36:00.680 --> 36:02.203
Hey.
What's going on?

36:03.465 --> 36:05.859
He went through my bag.

36:05.989 --> 36:08.775
Are you fucking kidding me?

36:08.905 --> 36:12.170
Okay, look, if this is
gonna work, you're gonna--

36:12.300 --> 36:14.911
Enough! All right? Enough!

36:15.042 --> 36:18.654
Now, this only works if
he stays out of my shit. Period.

36:18.785 --> 36:19.916
We have a way
of doing things here.

36:20.047 --> 36:21.266
That's good for you.

36:21.396 --> 36:22.484
I got a way of
doing things, too.

36:22.615 --> 36:23.790
You touch my stuff,

36:23.920 --> 36:25.661
I will smack
the fucking shit outta you.

36:26.749 --> 36:27.750
We clear?

36:32.364 --> 36:33.365
Good.

36:42.025 --> 36:43.288
Boyd said you saved his life.

36:48.728 --> 36:50.947
It-- it wasn't me,
it was, um...

36:56.605 --> 36:57.867
It's hard to explain.

36:59.956 --> 37:02.002
He said you hear voices.

37:05.832 --> 37:09.662
He said that that's why
you tried to kill Ethan,

37:09.792 --> 37:12.273
and how you
ended up killing Nathan.

37:14.841 --> 37:18.888
How does a voice
inside your head

37:19.019 --> 37:20.890
convince you to do
something like that?

37:21.021 --> 37:22.936
I mean, wouldn't your first
thought be

37:23.066 --> 37:24.633
that you're losing
your mind

37:24.764 --> 37:26.505
or that maybe
it was a bad idea?

37:27.984 --> 37:29.638
You don't understand.

37:29.769 --> 37:32.815
So help me understand.

37:32.946 --> 37:37.733
Because I really
wanna believe

37:37.864 --> 37:39.474
that Boyd is right
about you.

37:39.605 --> 37:42.695
I wanna back him up,

37:42.825 --> 37:44.871
but people are gonna freak out
when they find out about you.

37:46.873 --> 37:49.441
And that doesn't just hurt you.
That hurts Boyd.

37:49.571 --> 37:51.530
You understand?

37:51.660 --> 37:54.402
And I cannot
let that happen.

37:54.533 --> 37:55.751
So, help me.

37:57.536 --> 37:58.450
Please.

38:03.803 --> 38:07.067
Sara, I always thought
of you as a friend.

38:09.591 --> 38:12.681
And my mom...
my mom adores you.

38:12.812 --> 38:15.031
My mom always
thought of you as, like,

38:15.162 --> 38:16.816
the daughter that she never had.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.474
Convince me that you don't
deserve to go in the Box.

38:22.604 --> 38:23.562
I can't.

38:25.564 --> 38:27.479
Do you think
I want this?

38:32.048 --> 38:35.051
Boyd gave me a chance...

38:35.182 --> 38:37.097
that I didn't deserve.

38:38.925 --> 38:41.623
I'm grateful
to him for that.

38:41.754 --> 38:43.321
I'm glad
I got to help.

38:44.757 --> 38:45.888
But now I'm back.

38:47.194 --> 38:51.807
And I have done things
I can't undo.

38:51.938 --> 38:54.070
We can help!

38:54.201 --> 38:55.942
We can help make
people understand.

38:56.072 --> 38:58.640
You know,
we can do that.

38:58.771 --> 39:01.861
Sara, this town is
so hard on everyone,

39:01.991 --> 39:05.952
and I know you thought
that you found a way to...

39:09.651 --> 39:11.305
I know that it was horrible,

39:11.436 --> 39:12.959
I know that
it was unforgivable,

39:13.089 --> 39:16.005
but if we can
make people understand

39:16.136 --> 39:17.659
why you did
the things that you did,

39:17.790 --> 39:19.008
- maybe we could, you know--
- Kenny!

39:20.227 --> 39:21.402
Stop.

39:24.579 --> 39:26.538
There's something
I need to tell you.

39:34.763 --> 39:35.808
You okay?

39:40.116 --> 39:41.161
I heard about
the fight.

39:42.510 --> 39:43.990
He'll come around.
They always do.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.600
Not this one.

39:45.731 --> 39:48.429
I know his type.

39:48.560 --> 39:51.171
Everything's a personal attack,
a goddamn battle.

39:54.870 --> 39:55.871
Well, maybe...

39:58.526 --> 40:00.702
Maybe we change
the rules a little bit.

40:00.833 --> 40:03.052
Just ease up on
the communal sharing. Maybe we--

40:03.183 --> 40:06.578
Maybe we just give him a whole
wing of the goddamn house!

40:08.188 --> 40:09.494
That's not what I mean.

40:10.756 --> 40:11.670
I mean, it doesn't help--

40:11.800 --> 40:12.845
Oh, fuck this!

40:15.500 --> 40:17.415
Whoa, what are you doing?

40:17.545 --> 40:19.025
I'm gonna have a chat
with our little friend.

40:19.155 --> 40:20.418
Donna!

40:22.289 --> 40:24.030
Get up.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.074
What?

40:25.205 --> 40:26.989
Get your shit.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.818
You don't like the rules here,
you can live somewhere else.

40:32.081 --> 40:33.648
Get the fuck out of here.

40:34.736 --> 40:35.737
Jesus!

40:35.868 --> 40:37.043
Get the fuck up!

40:37.173 --> 40:38.131
Okay.

40:40.786 --> 40:42.048
Okay.

40:44.050 --> 40:45.486
You wanna tell me
where we're going?

40:45.617 --> 40:46.705
You'll see.

40:54.887 --> 40:55.931
Come on.

40:57.977 --> 40:59.065
- Come on!
- I'm coming.

41:05.158 --> 41:06.072
Well, I don't want
people staring at it

41:06.202 --> 41:07.116
when they're eatin'.

41:07.247 --> 41:08.944
Can't say I blame you.

41:15.211 --> 41:16.648
Welcome to your new home.

41:18.084 --> 41:18.954
What?

41:19.085 --> 41:20.782
Hop on up.

41:45.241 --> 41:48.070
Now, this here is the talisman
from the Matthews house.

41:48.201 --> 41:50.986
They won't be
needing it anymore.

41:51.117 --> 41:54.642
What you're gonna wanna do
is hang it on the window.

41:54.773 --> 41:57.558
And you wanna make
damn sure it stays there,

41:57.689 --> 41:59.778
because if it falls down at
any point during the night

41:59.908 --> 42:01.693
and one of those
things gets inside,

42:01.823 --> 42:04.826
it won't matter if
you have a dozen of those.

42:04.957 --> 42:08.656
If they're on the floor at
that point, they're just rocks.

42:12.660 --> 42:14.009
You done swinging
your dick around?

42:16.185 --> 42:16.969
You made your point.

42:17.099 --> 42:19.014
No.

42:19.145 --> 42:21.016
No, see,
I don't think I have.

42:23.018 --> 42:25.760
You don't want anyone
looking through your shit, fine,

42:25.891 --> 42:27.632
but I'll be motherfucked
if I let you hurt

42:27.762 --> 42:29.329
any more of my people.
You understand that?

42:32.724 --> 42:36.249
You really don't
get what's happening here.

42:37.859 --> 42:39.774
Even after
everything you've seen,

42:39.905 --> 42:43.822
you still can't process the fact
that this is actually real.

42:45.737 --> 42:47.216
Now, seeing as you
don't strike me as

42:47.347 --> 42:49.871
the brightest
of fucking bulbs,

42:50.002 --> 42:52.744
I'm gonna bet that it
takes you longer than most.

42:52.874 --> 42:55.137
So now you get to live here.

42:55.268 --> 42:56.704
No shades on the window.

42:56.835 --> 42:59.533
You get to see
everything that's happening.

42:59.664 --> 43:02.188
Every night those things come.

43:03.450 --> 43:05.800
There really is no way out.

43:11.371 --> 43:13.199
Best of luck.

43:36.396 --> 43:37.919
Excuse me?

43:39.704 --> 43:41.619
Sheriff Boyd, right?

43:41.749 --> 43:43.185
Yeah, sorry, I don't, uh--

43:43.316 --> 43:44.143
Tillie.

43:44.273 --> 43:45.710
Tillie. Hi.

43:45.840 --> 43:46.711
- Hi, yeah.
- Hi.

43:46.841 --> 43:47.973
I was on the bus.

43:48.103 --> 43:49.627
Yeah.

43:49.757 --> 43:52.107
This, uh, wasn't exactly
my preferred destination.

43:54.153 --> 43:57.896
I understand you yourself
had a bit of an adventure.

43:58.026 --> 44:00.942
Yeah, I did. I'm sorry.
You'll have to excuse me.

44:01.073 --> 44:02.770
I need to go
speak with my deputy.

44:02.901 --> 44:04.990
You won't find him in there.

44:05.120 --> 44:07.253
I just saw him heading
towards that medical building.

44:25.837 --> 44:26.751
I, uh...

44:28.840 --> 44:30.276
...went to look for
you at the church.

44:35.237 --> 44:36.456
You know,
before we came here...

44:39.894 --> 44:42.941
...I don't think I ever once
remember seeing my mom cry.

44:46.118 --> 44:48.381
I'd see her mad.
I'd see her stubborn.

44:48.511 --> 44:49.774
I'd see her frustrated.

44:51.471 --> 44:55.475
And now every
single night...

44:57.477 --> 45:00.436
...I hear her sobbing
in her room,

45:00.567 --> 45:03.265
because she's convinced
that it was her fault...

45:04.963 --> 45:06.921
that if she had
been here with my dad...

45:08.836 --> 45:11.143
that he wouldn't have
gotten out of the basement...

45:16.017 --> 45:18.324
...and he wouldn't have opened
the door to let those things in.

45:23.329 --> 45:24.852
But he didn't
open the door, did he?

45:28.334 --> 45:29.335
No.

45:32.468 --> 45:33.513
You knew.

45:36.342 --> 45:37.865
I found out
the night before I left.

45:39.301 --> 45:40.433
Kenny--

45:40.563 --> 45:43.871
Don't.
Don't fucking touch me!

45:44.002 --> 45:45.525
I was going to tell you.

45:45.655 --> 45:47.222
When exactly were you
planning on telling me?

45:52.924 --> 45:54.273
She's going in the Box.

45:56.014 --> 45:57.015
No.

45:57.145 --> 45:58.494
She's going in the fucking Box!

45:58.625 --> 45:59.713
Kenny--

45:59.844 --> 46:01.236
She killed my dad!

46:01.367 --> 46:04.762
They tore him to pieces
and you knew!

46:04.892 --> 46:06.459
You fucking knew!

46:06.589 --> 46:08.417
Kenny, please, Kenny.

46:09.592 --> 46:11.072
Li--

46:15.642 --> 46:17.339
You watch your own fucking six.
