- Sounds mysterious.
- No, no, it's not, really.

17:39.813 --> 17:42.482
My daughter calls us bourgeois.

[TIRES SQUEALING]

17:56.496 --> 17:58.123
Thank you so much.

17:58.331 --> 18:02.544
- No problem. It was nice to meet you.
- You too.

18:04.129 --> 18:06.590
- Nice house.
- Thank you.

18:17.601 --> 18:21.104
I tell you, the thing I like
about Moltisanti?

18:21.271 --> 18:25.025
He'll even tell Tony Soprano
to go fuck himself.

18:25.233 --> 18:26.943
The guy's fearless.

18:27.402 --> 18:28.486
Who's fearless?

18:28.653 --> 18:31.489
Chris Moltisanti.
Where's my mother?

18:31.865 --> 18:33.909
She's an early riser.

18:35.660 --> 18:37.120
What about Moltisanti?

18:37.329 --> 18:41.082
We were saying he's young
to be made. That kind of shit.

18:41.291 --> 18:45.211
He wanted it
so he stepped up and took it.

18:45.921 --> 18:50.300
Like your dad and Tony Soprano.
Know how they made their names?

18:50.508 --> 18:53.178
- How?
- We got any marshmallows?

18:53.345 --> 18:55.805
Come on, what about my father?

19:01.019 --> 19:04.272
When we was kids,
we had our own little crew.

19:04.439 --> 19:09.069
Me, your dad, buon 'anima,
Tony, Silvio Dante.

19:09.235 --> 19:14.032
We'd do Mickey Mouse scores,
you know, moving pot...

19:15.700 --> 19:17.494
...swag. Bullshit stuff.

19:17.661 --> 19:21.665
We thought we were
like the sixth family.

19:21.831 --> 19:24.292
But who knew we was even alive?

19:24.751 --> 19:27.045
Till one fucking night.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.923
And I gotta give your father credit.

19:30.131 --> 19:35.011
He had balls as big
as an Irish broad's ass.

19:35.970 --> 19:38.014
There was this old...

19:38.181 --> 19:40.308
...old mustache named...

19:41.768 --> 19:43.561
...Feech Lamanna.

19:44.354 --> 19:47.607
What Feech meant,
who the fuck knows?

19:47.816 --> 19:52.028
But he was made on the other side,
so he was an original.

19:52.237 --> 19:54.114
He was an O.G.

19:55.365 --> 19:56.741
Whatever.

19:57.659 --> 20:01.079
He had this Saturday night
card game...

20:01.287 --> 20:05.208
...and your father sees a chance
to rise to the A-league.

20:05.417 --> 20:11.005
Connected or not, him,
me and Tony were gonna rob him.

20:11.881 --> 20:14.342
We thought your father lost a marble.

20:14.509 --> 20:17.053
- But he said, "Fuck it."
- Balls.

20:17.220 --> 20:18.763
What happened?

20:18.972 --> 20:22.308
They took it down and
walked away with 20 large.

20:22.517 --> 20:23.685
Jesus Christ.

20:23.852 --> 20:26.855
What do you mean, "they"?
You didn't go?

20:28.064 --> 20:30.817
I'm still sick over it.

20:30.984 --> 20:34.737
I caught the clap from some
hippie broad I was fucking.

20:34.946 --> 20:38.450
My dick was dripping
like a busted pipe.

20:38.700 --> 20:41.369
Anyways, the rest is history.

20:41.536 --> 20:46.583
Your father and Tony was on the
fast track to being made, and I...

20:46.791 --> 20:50.378
...was still a little shit here,
like the two of you.

20:50.545 --> 20:55.008
And of course I, whatever...
But that was a few years later.

20:55.216 --> 20:58.219
- They get away with it?
RALPH: What could Feech do?

20:58.386 --> 21:00.013
There was a sit-down.

21:00.180 --> 21:04.642
And the right people
got some of their money back...

21:04.851 --> 21:06.811
...but the point was made.

21:07.061 --> 21:10.982
Your father and Tony were rising stars
to be respected.

21:13.443 --> 21:14.777
Cocksuckers.

21:16.487 --> 21:20.074
All right, kiddies.
That's enough for tonight.

21:21.993 --> 21:23.786
Oh, Jackie.

21:23.953 --> 21:28.833
Rinse those plates before you put
them in the dishwasher. It clogs.

21:35.715 --> 21:40.345
MAN OVER TV: We can 't help but be
amazed at the instincts they possess.

21:40.762 --> 21:46.517
To protect all manner of livestock.
To be protective of us.

21:50.355 --> 21:53.191
What can we do to protect them?

21:53.399 --> 21:55.610
Nurture their defenses...

21:55.818 --> 21:59.405
...using the natural body
defense system in Pedigree.

21:59.572 --> 22:01.783
What is wrong with me?

22:01.991 --> 22:03.326
Pedigree.

22:10.291 --> 22:11.834
Are you drunk?

22:17.340 --> 22:21.636
- How about right here?
- You would, wouldn't you? Huh?

22:22.762 --> 22:25.264
GLORIA:
Does my car look slanted?

22:26.766 --> 22:28.643
Oh, shit.

22:29.686 --> 22:31.729
I have a flat.

22:33.356 --> 22:35.066
Oh, my God.

22:36.192 --> 22:37.902
Jesus Christ.

22:40.113 --> 22:41.823
So creepy.

22:42.073 --> 22:43.366
Why?

22:43.616 --> 22:45.243
I don't know.

22:47.912 --> 22:49.288
What?

22:49.497 --> 22:50.873
What?

22:52.583 --> 22:55.586
- You know who did this, don't you?
- What?

22:55.753 --> 22:59.006
I saw that look.
At least don't lie to me.

22:59.340 --> 23:02.760
- What do I know about your tires?
- Fine.

23:03.010 --> 23:04.971
Thanks for your help.

23:05.304 --> 23:06.931
One time.

23:07.890 --> 23:13.479
My ex-girlfriend, she got a little
jealous and she slashed my tires.

23:13.688 --> 23:16.607
That thought went through
my mind just then.

23:17.066 --> 23:20.653
- It couldn't have been her.
- The cunt that called?

23:20.820 --> 23:23.489
- My car's fucked!
- You work for a dealer.

23:23.656 --> 23:27.243
- You think I get free tires?
- So I'll pay for it!

23:27.410 --> 23:30.997
Why offer if you didn't
have a guilty conscience?

23:31.289 --> 23:32.832
About what?

23:33.458 --> 23:35.084
I don't know. Tell me.

23:35.293 --> 23:38.045
This is fucking bullshit.
I'm going home.

23:38.212 --> 23:40.590
- Who else would do it?
- Kids, maybe.

23:40.756 --> 23:43.843
- Ruin a great evening over this!
- Kids!

23:44.010 --> 23:46.053
Maybe your brother-in-law.

23:46.220 --> 23:50.516
Maybe Mr. Globe, since you're
America's sweetheart this week.

23:50.683 --> 23:53.060
Where the fuck do you get off?

23:53.311 --> 23:57.273
This immigrant, alcoholic,
probably HIV-laden slut...

23:57.482 --> 23:59.192
Whoa with that!

23:59.358 --> 24:03.821
...slashes my tires and you
call my life into question?

24:04.030 --> 24:07.366
She wouldn't do it!
I slapped the piss out of her.

24:07.533 --> 24:10.203
Oh. Did you?

24:12.205 --> 24:14.332
Did you really hit her?

24:19.462 --> 24:21.088
I don't know.

24:22.006 --> 24:26.135
She's a poor, confused kid
from an underdeveloped country.

24:26.302 --> 24:28.596
Even if she did do this.

24:28.763 --> 24:32.600
I'll make some calls.
I'll have new Michelins in an hour.

24:32.767 --> 24:37.897
What are these? 85-R16's? What?

24:39.190 --> 24:41.567
Jesus Christ.

24:42.777 --> 24:44.403
All right, 17's!

24:47.823 --> 24:51.953
Gene Pontecorvo's got a card game.
We could take it down now.

24:52.161 --> 24:54.538
Are you crazy? He's with Ralph.

24:54.705 --> 24:57.250
Essentially, that's Ralph's game.

24:57.458 --> 25:01.045
Even better. Fuck him
and his rinse-your-dishes shit.

25:01.254 --> 25:03.714
Know what?
I think he's a secret fag.

25:04.340 --> 25:05.508
I don't know.

25:05.716 --> 25:09.470
Maybe take Carlo. He's got a shotgun.
We wear masks.

25:09.637 --> 25:12.723
We go in.
We're out in like two minutes.

25:12.890 --> 25:16.227
- What if they find out it's us?
- We want them to.

25:16.394 --> 25:18.771
Not right away,
but like Ralph said.

25:18.980 --> 25:22.149
When they do, you know
it's gonna get squashed.

25:22.316 --> 25:24.193
My old man
was Jackie Aprile.

25:24.402 --> 25:27.571
The worse that'll happen,
we give some back.

25:27.989 --> 25:29.615
We pull this off...

25:29.782 --> 25:35.037
...we're like free agents.
We dictate the terms, not them.

25:35.246 --> 25:37.999
Because we show balls.

25:38.165 --> 25:40.292
Come on, call Carlo.

25:47.383 --> 25:49.969
Fuck. There's no signal.

25:50.177 --> 25:54.223
I'd have to be pretty stupid
to write a book about killing...

25:54.390 --> 25:56.100
Use that phone.

25:57.685 --> 25:59.311
Oh, yeah, this one.

25:59.520 --> 26:02.690
Come on, hurry up, call Carlo.

26:03.315 --> 26:07.236
- They show my favorite part yet?
- I think it's coming up.

26:07.445 --> 26:08.988
The answer's no.

26:13.159 --> 26:17.788
- Dude, move over. Give me some room.
- Fuck you, it's my house.

26:19.165 --> 26:20.624
Here it comes.

26:20.833 --> 26:22.543
Yeah.

26:23.961 --> 26:25.755
WOMAN:
Like a cigarette, Nick?

26:33.137 --> 26:36.140
MAN 1: You two know each other?
MAN 2: No.

26:38.851 --> 26:44.857
I saw a psychiatrist. That's why
Father Intintola said we should talk.

26:45.024 --> 26:48.778
He said you were getting
a doctorate in psychiatry.

26:48.986 --> 26:49.987
Psychology.

26:50.196 --> 26:55.326
The psychiatrist told me my
whole life is a lie, and he's right.

26:56.452 --> 26:59.288
And now I think I'm sick.

27:00.706 --> 27:04.126
And if I die, I will never
be with God in eternity.

27:04.335 --> 27:08.088
- You're ill?
- I think I have ovarian cancer.

27:08.297 --> 27:12.426
- What does the doctor say?
- I haven't seen one.

27:13.636 --> 27:14.887
I'm afraid.

27:15.095 --> 27:20.392
- Why do you think you are ill?
- I'm spotting. Lower back pain.

27:20.559 --> 27:26.148
My hormones are all over the place.
My cousin Kathy died from it.

27:26.315 --> 27:30.361
God doesn't punish people
for mistakes that they've made.

27:30.528 --> 27:33.447
He loves you more than you know.

27:34.949 --> 27:39.161
Have you thought, with your symptoms,
you might be with child?

27:39.328 --> 27:41.455
I know, that's another...

27:42.414 --> 27:47.211
Would you be more comfortable
if we set this sacrament aside...

27:47.419 --> 27:50.256
...and stepped into my office?

28:05.354 --> 28:08.941
The psychiatrist said
I should leave my husband.

28:10.234 --> 28:12.945
When he said that, it seemed so right.

28:13.112 --> 28:17.825
You made a sacred vow.
Divorce is out of the question.

28:18.033 --> 28:22.246
Unless...
Is he abusive, your husband?

28:22.454 --> 28:24.832
Not to me. But he is unfaithful.

28:25.332 --> 28:28.335
He's a good man basically, but...

28:29.503 --> 28:33.257
I talked to Father Intintola
years ago, and here I am.

28:33.465 --> 28:36.385
- Do you love your husband?
- I do.

28:36.552 --> 28:40.472
I love my husband.
And I love God.

28:41.557 --> 28:44.143
But my life is financed by crime.

28:45.602 --> 28:47.146
His crime.

28:48.689 --> 28:52.526
Fifty thousand dollars
to my daughter's college.

28:52.985 --> 28:56.321
The psychiatrist says
it's all blood money.

28:56.572 --> 28:59.658
Now, to maybe bring another child
into this?

28:59.825 --> 29:05.164
God understands that we all live
in the middle of tensions.

29:05.789 --> 29:09.043
You say your husband has good in him.

29:09.293 --> 29:14.173
What you have to do is learn to live
on what the good part earns.

29:14.423 --> 29:16.133
The what?

29:19.595 --> 29:22.514
There is a point inside yourself.

29:22.723 --> 29:27.770
An inner boundary beyond which
you feel culpable.

29:27.978 --> 29:31.815
You've got to come to an awareness
of where that line is.

29:31.982 --> 29:35.569
And forego those things
which lay without it.

29:35.736 --> 29:40.532
- The Church has changed so much.
- It's a complex world.

29:42.034 --> 29:47.790
Learn to live on the good part. Forego
those things that lay without it.

29:51.418 --> 29:54.129
I think I can do that, Father.

29:54.922 --> 29:56.381
I'll try.

29:56.590 --> 29:59.843
And go see an ob-gyn.

30:05.724 --> 30:07.684
This mad-cow disease.

30:07.851 --> 30:11.897
It's terrible the English government
didn't tell people.

30:12.105 --> 30:15.025
Maybe they didn't wanna
create a stampede.

30:17.611 --> 30:19.571
Oh, by the way...

30:19.738 --> 30:24.701
...guess which former medical student
no longer dates the Queen of Mean.

30:24.868 --> 30:26.495
You're kidding.

30:27.412 --> 30:32.042
- Jackie Jr. and Meadow are finished?
- Frankly, I am delighted.

30:33.043 --> 30:37.589
Kevin told Angie Bonpensiero
that Jackie was smoking marijuana.

30:37.756 --> 30:41.885
- And was caught cheating at Rutgers.
- Gee, that bad?

30:42.052 --> 30:44.513
That black kid would've been better.

30:44.763 --> 30:48.976
He's got a 4.0 and he's moving
to India for the U.N.

30:49.184 --> 30:51.311
- I told you.
- That's my fault.

30:51.937 --> 30:54.773
She wasted three months
with Jackie Jr.

30:54.982 --> 30:56.149
[PHONE RINGS]

30:56.400 --> 30:58.944
- Hello.
- Mrs. Soprano!

30:59.152 --> 31:02.406
- Gloria Trillo, Globe Motors.
- Hi, how are you?

31:02.614 --> 31:06.285
I hope this is a good time.
The new E-320 just came in.

31:06.493 --> 31:08.370
You might wanna take a look.

31:08.579 --> 31:12.958
No, I don't think so.
I still have another year on my lease.

31:13.125 --> 31:15.502
Maybe your husband will treat you.

31:15.711 --> 31:18.171
Maybe I will.
Thank you for calling.

31:18.380 --> 31:20.757
Okay, bye. Hope to see you!

31:21.091 --> 31:22.301
Bye-bye.

31:25.137 --> 31:27.264
Well, what a nice woman.

31:27.431 --> 31:28.598
Who?

31:28.807 --> 31:32.144
Just some saleswoman
from Globe Motors.

31:35.731 --> 31:36.982
What?

31:38.317 --> 31:43.447
She wants me to try the new wagon.
I'm not interested, but she was nice.

31:43.655 --> 31:46.825
She took me home
while they serviced the wagon.

31:46.992 --> 31:50.746
I should hold onto it another year,
don't you think?

31:51.788 --> 31:53.415
Another year.

31:54.333 --> 31:55.584
Yeah.

32:05.594 --> 32:09.014
MAN: I was just wondering
if we could switch days off.

32:09.389 --> 32:11.850
- Give me a minute.
- We could switch...

32:12.017 --> 32:14.936
I got a customer coming in, all right?
Tony.

32:21.568 --> 32:25.155
Are you out of your fucking mind,
talking to my wife?

32:25.322 --> 32:30.994
I was upset about your ex-girlfriend.
I thought you should see my version.

32:33.789 --> 32:35.415
I'm sorry, all right?

32:35.874 --> 32:38.335
You drove her home. What the fuck?

32:38.502 --> 32:42.089
Then you look right into my eyes
and don't tell me?

32:44.424 --> 32:49.304
It's normal to be curious about
someone you love's significant others.

32:49.513 --> 32:52.599
- It's not. It's fucking twisted.
- It is not.

32:52.808 --> 32:55.018

49:49.114 --> 49:52.200
You schooled him as best you could.

49:53.159 --> 49:54.536
Didn't you?

50:00.792 --> 50:02.752
Jack spoiled him.

50:03.920 --> 50:06.131
I think this is yours.

50:07.090 --> 50:11.720
The stupid kid was carrying it around
during the holidays.

50:48.965 --> 50:51.801
She wanted me to fucking kill her.

50:52.010 --> 50:54.053
Like suicide by cop.

50:54.846 --> 50:56.890
So she set me up?

50:57.807 --> 51:00.268
She saw me as only a fucking hammer?

51:00.477 --> 51:02.187
She loved you.

51:04.189 --> 51:07.859
She looked so good too,
that day in your office.

51:09.819 --> 51:13.072
Just another Irina
with a college degree.

51:13.364 --> 51:14.741
Ask yourself.

51:14.949 --> 51:20.955
How did you recognize in Gloria,
under her layers of sophistication...

51:21.164 --> 51:26.503
...this deeply wounded, angry being
that would let you replicate...

51:26.753 --> 51:29.422
...your relationship
with your mother?

51:29.589 --> 51:33.718
I don't wanna fuck my mother.
You're never gonna convince me.

51:33.927 --> 51:35.470
Not fuck.

51:35.845 --> 51:37.889
Try to please her.

51:38.097 --> 51:39.891
Try to win her love.

51:40.058 --> 51:42.185
Forty fucking years old.

51:42.393 --> 51:46.606
We need to repeat what's familiar,
even if it's bad for us.

51:46.773 --> 51:49.859
Gloria's need for drama.

51:50.276 --> 51:54.322
The selfishness.
The incessant self-regard.

51:55.490 --> 51:56.866
At one time...

51:57.075 --> 52:00.578
...in your mother's hands,
it passed for love.

52:02.038 --> 52:05.542
All right, look. You're her doctor.
You tell me.

52:05.750 --> 52:08.044
Do I gotta worry about this broad?

52:08.253 --> 52:11.089
She says she's gonna
tell Carmela about us.

52:11.297 --> 52:13.841
I honestly can't predict.

52:15.885 --> 52:17.595
We should deal with...

52:17.804 --> 52:21.641
...why are you so attracted
to dangerous relationships?

52:21.808 --> 52:24.811
Why do you put your marriage
in such danger?

52:25.979 --> 52:30.024
- Maybe I'm looking for a way out.
- Anthony.

52:30.608 --> 52:34.654
- You'll never leave your wife.
- Bullshit. There's a limit.

52:34.862 --> 52:38.116
She might leave you,
but you'll never leave her.

52:40.243 --> 52:42.620
Despite your mothering...

52:42.787 --> 52:47.583
...you made one good decision
in your life vis-à-vis women.

52:47.750 --> 52:49.794
You won't throw that over.

52:50.003 --> 52:53.923
Your own selfishness is too strong
to let that happen.

52:54.090 --> 52:55.967
All right. All right.

52:56.592 --> 53:01.931
Actually, in spite of everything
you're a very conventional man.

53:02.140 --> 53:03.766
I said all right.

53:04.517 --> 53:06.811
We have to stop now.

53:20.158 --> 53:24.620
- Got pep, I'll give it that.
- Zero to 60 in under seven seconds.

53:35.381 --> 53:38.051
What's the matter, you don't like me?

53:41.929 --> 53:46.476
I'm not back, they call the cops,
standard operating procedure.

53:46.851 --> 53:51.647
Here's standard operating procedure.
Stay away from Tony Soprano.

53:51.814 --> 53:55.943
Shut the fuck up and listen.
It's over, capisce?

53:56.736 --> 53:58.362
Over and done.

53:58.571 --> 54:02.950
You call or go anywhere near him
or his family...

54:03.159 --> 54:07.538
...and they'll be scraping your
nipples off these leather seats.

54:07.705 --> 54:10.166
And here's the point to remember.

54:10.333 --> 54:15.129
My face is the last one you'll see.
Not Tony's.

54:16.005 --> 54:18.132
We understand each other?

54:18.966 --> 54:21.427
It won't be cinematic.

54:34.482 --> 54:36.275
[DOOR OPENS]

54:43.074 --> 54:45.368
Any word, anything?

54:46.160 --> 54:48.829
He probably went down to Florida.

54:49.830 --> 54:52.208
Ro, I'm sure he's fine.

54:52.875 --> 54:54.585
Ro, come on.

55:08.474 --> 55:09.725
Look.

55:11.227 --> 55:14.730
- This will be hard for you to hear.
- Jesus Christ!

55:14.897 --> 55:18.317
No, it's okay. It's okay, it's just...

55:20.403 --> 55:23.239
...he has a very serious drug problem.

55:23.406 --> 55:24.657
What?

55:26.367 --> 55:30.288
It's coke.
He may owe some money to dealers.

55:30.621 --> 55:32.582
[ROSALIE SOBS]

55:32.832 --> 55:35.501
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't wanna tell you.

55:35.960 --> 55:38.879
Look, we're doing everything we can.

55:43.926 --> 55:45.636
We're gonna find him.

55:45.845 --> 55:47.888
We'll get him help.

55:48.306 --> 55:50.516
We'll get him to rehab.

55:53.853 --> 55:57.023
Let's just hope he's not too far gone.

56:21.422 --> 56:23.632
Something smells good.

56:24.800 --> 56:28.637
Lemon snaps for the
bake sale at church.

56:38.689 --> 56:39.982
You look good.

56:41.025 --> 56:43.486
I went to step today.

56:44.862 --> 56:49.992
Is that why you don't have these
looney-tune moods when you exercise?

56:52.703 --> 56:54.580
Where's your ring?

56:58.084 --> 57:01.170
I had to get it sized.
It's a little big.

57:06.717 --> 57:09.470
[OVEN TIMER BUZZES]

57:24.401 --> 57:28.864
Hi, it's me. I'll be home
in about twenty minutes.

57:30.157 --> 57:32.910
Yeah, I picked up the stuffed shells.

57:33.118 --> 57:36.622
No, the Celantano's,
you just gotta heat them up.
