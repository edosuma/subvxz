to get in there and get the Artifact.

19:14.458 --> 19:17.458
[screaming]

19:23.166 --> 19:24.583
Isn't that your horse?

19:24.666 --> 19:26.083
That is no one's horse.

19:26.791 --> 19:30.083
Look, I have to go back in. The General
is only gonna go on the offensive

19:30.166 --> 19:34.291
if I stop the Nowhere King
from making any more of those things.

19:34.375 --> 19:36.166
I can find another way around.

19:36.666 --> 19:38.541
No. It's too risky.

19:38.625 --> 19:41.666
If I let you go back in there
and something happens to you…

19:42.625 --> 19:44.958
You're what she's fighting for.

19:45.041 --> 19:46.666
Horse loses you to the Nowhere King

19:46.750 --> 19:50.166
when there was another way
to bring the General's army to the fight?

19:50.250 --> 19:53.416
Well,
that's not gonna be good for anybody,

19:53.500 --> 19:56.500
especially the shaman
who didn't step in to stop it.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.208
So, what then?

19:59.833 --> 20:03.208
You didn't get the Artifact,
but you got something even better.

20:03.291 --> 20:04.125
Me.

20:07.541 --> 20:08.375
Finally.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.375
Are you kidding me?

20:14.208 --> 20:15.250
You're back.

20:15.333 --> 20:17.750
So… So glad you're alive.

20:17.833 --> 20:21.333
I thought if the minotaurs didn't get ya,
she would.

20:22.083 --> 20:24.000
How many did she kill?

20:24.083 --> 20:25.916
I… I couldn't say.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.333
I really couldn't say.

20:27.416 --> 20:29.958
We'll mark her down for six.

20:30.041 --> 20:34.208
But we know it's more,
don't we, Becky Apples?

20:34.291 --> 20:35.250
Yes, we do.

20:37.250 --> 20:41.125
I thought I was pretty clear
when I told you you shouldn't go in there.

21:03.791 --> 21:05.041
That's a centaur.

21:05.125 --> 21:06.041
Bingo.

21:07.875 --> 21:11.375
I hear you're thinking of taking
a defensive position in this war.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.041
But that would be very offensive to me.

21:15.833 --> 21:19.291
And you don't wanna offend Waterbaby,
do you?

21:19.833 --> 21:23.916
It's my job to protect my people.
We've lost so many.

21:26.083 --> 21:27.666
The strategy is this.

21:28.416 --> 21:32.291
First, we're gonna gather the centaurs
and bring them right here to the Rift.

21:32.375 --> 21:36.916
Then you'll gather your soldiers
and we'll form one army, together.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.916
With the magic of the centaurs
and the might of your troops…

21:40.000 --> 21:41.083
[grunts]

21:41.916 --> 21:45.083
…the Nowhere King
won't stand a chance against us!

21:45.166 --> 21:47.583
-Oh yeah! War!
-Yeah!

21:49.083 --> 21:51.541
