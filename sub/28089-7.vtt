00:19.910 --> 00:24.910
[Cliff] <i>Previously
on</i> Doom Patrol...

00:25.150 --> 00:27.110
[Jane] <i>How often
does he come see them?</i>

00:27.150 --> 00:29.820
[Josh] <i>Niles? Not very.</i>

00:29.850 --> 00:31.480
[Jane]
<i>So he just abandoned them?</i>

00:31.490 --> 00:32.590
<i>Like broken toys?</i>

00:32.619 --> 00:34.020
<i>Why would he send me here?</i>

00:34.060 --> 00:35.960
<i>Why would he wanna
abandon me too?</i>

00:35.990 --> 00:39.090
'Cause I think that's what Mr. Nobody
really wants, is for you to give up.

00:39.130 --> 00:40.530
That's why he sent you here.

00:40.560 --> 00:42.930
<i>See what happens to those
who cross him.</i>

00:42.960 --> 00:47.130
[Mr. Nobody] <i>Cyborg didn't even realize
he'd left his arm cannon charging.</i>

00:47.170 --> 00:50.470
Goodbye, Victor Stone.

00:53.570 --> 00:55.010
<i>...enabled your privacy mode.</i>

00:55.040 --> 00:56.540
I won't be
listening in anymore.

00:56.580 --> 00:59.180
[Rita] <i>For the last 60 years,
I decided that Rita Farr</i>

00:59.210 --> 01:01.680
was someone who deserved
to be punished.

01:01.710 --> 01:05.420
<i>Rita Farr is empty and ugly.</i>

01:05.450 --> 01:07.620
<i>I don't wanna be
those things anymore.</i>

01:07.650 --> 01:11.430
[Larry] <i>I see everyone
I've ever loved. Burning.</i>

01:11.460 --> 01:14.160
Have you ever tried communicating
this to the spirit?

01:14.200 --> 01:15.930
Perhaps you should
give it a try.

01:15.960 --> 01:19.730
I just thought that you should have the
chance to get to know your daughter.

01:19.770 --> 01:20.970
Come on!

02:35.880 --> 02:38.130
[clock ticking]

02:54.230 --> 02:57.730
[Cliff] Look, we all wanna
find the Chief.

02:57.760 --> 03:01.370
To find the Chief
we gotta go through Mr. Nobody.

03:01.400 --> 03:05.240
And I think we can all agree
if we don't get our shit together

03:05.270 --> 03:06.770
right here, right now,

03:06.810 --> 03:09.410
Mr. Nobody is gonna fuck us.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.280
He's gonna fuck us
in our brains,

03:11.310 --> 03:13.150
he's gonna fuck us
in our hearts,

03:13.180 --> 03:14.620
he's gonna fuck us
in our souls.

03:14.650 --> 03:17.620
Now I don't know what kind of
freaky shit your souls are into,

03:17.650 --> 03:19.290
and I'm not one to judge,

03:19.320 --> 03:24.190
but I wanna keep
my soul un-fucked.

03:24.230 --> 03:28.060
No? None of you
have any issues?

03:28.100 --> 03:31.300
Nothing it wouldn't help
to get off your chest?

03:31.330 --> 03:34.330
Well, this is fucking awkward.

03:34.370 --> 03:38.370
It's right around here.
Okay. Are you excited?

03:38.410 --> 03:40.770
[whispers]
Oh, please be quiet.

03:40.810 --> 03:45.550
Be quiet. Okay.

03:45.580 --> 03:48.010
Damn it, Frankie,
I said no visitors

03:48.050 --> 03:50.250
until we're done shooting
this endless coverage.

03:50.280 --> 03:52.990
Yes, Ms. Singer,
it's just, um,

03:53.020 --> 03:58.020
this is the Cooke County
pageant winner.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.060
[clears throat]

04:01.100 --> 04:06.100
[whispers]
Meeting you is the prize.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.200
Nice to meet you.

04:11.240 --> 04:13.470
Please call me Ethel.

04:13.510 --> 04:16.279
We're so grateful.
We're such big fans.

04:16.310 --> 04:19.079
Oh, yes, especially her.
You're her idol.

04:19.110 --> 04:21.750
- Oh.
- She's a little star in the making.

04:21.779 --> 04:22.920
Is that so?

04:22.950 --> 04:25.620
It's been dance classes, voice
lessons, acting workshops

04:25.650 --> 04:27.320
ever since she was
old enough to coo.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.360
Oh, well,
that's a start.

04:29.390 --> 04:31.490
And what about school?

04:31.530 --> 04:34.190
[Father] No, no other
children to distract her.

04:34.230 --> 04:35.700
She's got pictures
in her future.

04:35.730 --> 04:38.000
[Ethel] Mmm.

04:38.030 --> 04:39.570
- [whispers] Come.
- Oh, yeah.

04:39.600 --> 04:43.170
[Ethel] Hmm.

04:43.200 --> 04:48.200
With a face like that
she just might.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.380
What's your name, little one?

04:50.410 --> 04:51.980
- My name is...
- Uh-uh.

04:52.010 --> 04:55.760
Your stage name, darling.

04:58.650 --> 05:00.090
I'm Rita Farr.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.690
[knocking on door]

05:01.720 --> 05:04.360
[Vic] Good morning, Rita.
Team meeting in 15.

05:04.390 --> 05:05.860
The hunt for
the Chief continues.

05:05.890 --> 05:07.160
[Rita sighs]

05:07.190 --> 05:08.960
- [Rita] I'll be there.
- [bubbling]

05:09.000 --> 05:12.270
The person who is
breathing is me.

05:12.300 --> 05:15.140
The person who is
breathing is me.

05:15.170 --> 05:18.210
- [slurping noises]
- Shit.

05:18.420 --> 05:23.959
I just have to pull myself together
is all.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.190
[sighs]

05:26.230 --> 05:31.230
The person who is
breathing is Rita Farr.

05:32.430 --> 05:37.430
The person who is
breathing is Rita Farr.

05:46.750 --> 05:48.100
[exhales]

05:54.490 --> 05:56.440
Close enough.

06:02.260 --> 06:03.660
Good morning, Hammerhead.

06:03.700 --> 06:08.700
Ugh. What the fuck
is wrong with your neck?

06:15.280 --> 06:20.010
[bubbling]

06:20.050 --> 06:23.500
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

06:28.320 --> 06:31.260
[panting]

06:31.290 --> 06:35.260
[Rita] Shit!

06:35.290 --> 06:37.300
[Rita] Help!

06:37.330 --> 06:39.270
Help.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.130
Anyone?

06:41.170 --> 06:43.840
Can anyone hear me?

06:43.870 --> 06:45.770
God damn it!

06:45.810 --> 06:48.810
How many humiliations
must I be made to suffer?

06:48.840 --> 06:53.680
Squirming through ducts
like some kind of rat.

06:53.710 --> 06:57.420
Please, no rats. No rats.

06:57.450 --> 07:00.900
[metal clanking loudly]

07:03.920 --> 07:07.160
The person who is
breathing is me.

07:07.190 --> 07:11.100
The person with an arm

07:11.130 --> 07:13.070
is me.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.640
Ah!

07:16.670 --> 07:21.320
The person with
two arms is me.

07:22.410 --> 07:23.410
Ha!

07:52.570 --> 07:54.339
[baby crying]

07:54.340 --> 07:59.370
The person who is sick of having creepy
baby imagery shoved in her face is me.

08:01.480 --> 08:05.590
The person who is
sick of being judged is me!

08:05.620 --> 08:08.550
[Rita sighs]

08:08.590 --> 08:13.590
The person who
deserves this is me.

08:16.600 --> 08:21.400
Maybe I am just
a ball of slime.

08:22.870 --> 08:27.870
Maybe I always was
a ball of slime.

08:31.350 --> 08:33.450
Maybe

08:33.480 --> 08:36.980
the real trick
is being the best

08:37.020 --> 08:41.020
goddamn ball of slime
I can be.

08:41.049 --> 08:42.820
Think I'm disgusting?

08:42.860 --> 08:45.530
I'll show you disgusting!

08:45.560 --> 08:48.590
You think some stairs
are going to stop me?

08:48.630 --> 08:53.130
Swallow the whole
damn town if I wanted to!

08:53.170 --> 08:55.120
[Rita groans]

08:59.310 --> 09:03.110
Ha!

09:03.140 --> 09:04.779
[Cliff yelling] You think
that's gonna hurt me?

09:04.780 --> 09:08.980
[energy charging, explosion]

09:10.450 --> 09:12.650
Hmm...

09:12.690 --> 09:16.160
[slime bubbling]

09:16.190 --> 09:17.190
No!

09:36.840 --> 09:38.786
[Debbie Trainor] Lord help us.
What are we going to do?

09:38.810 --> 09:41.426
[Gerald Trainor] Quit your hysterics.
There's nothing wrong with our boy.

09:41.450 --> 09:44.120
That principal's had it out
for Larry since day one.

09:44.150 --> 09:47.120
[Debbie] Gerald, he was caught
playing doctor

09:47.150 --> 09:50.960
with Benjamin Quincy
behind the swing sets.

09:50.990 --> 09:53.630
I swear, if that woman accuses
my son of being a queer...

09:53.660 --> 09:56.630
Oh, please,
you know it's true!

09:56.660 --> 09:59.070
[sobs]
The signs are everywhere.

09:59.100 --> 10:03.939
And now your son is going to
cost us our standing at school,

10:03.940 --> 10:05.740
at church.

10:05.770 --> 10:09.740
Lord, Gerald,
we could lose everything.

10:09.780 --> 10:11.650
[banging on door]

10:11.680 --> 10:16.680
[Vic] Yo, Larry,
team meeting in 15.

11:11.740 --> 11:12.790
[sighs]

11:21.280 --> 11:25.550
What do you say
we take the day off, buddy?

11:25.590 --> 11:26.940
Sleep in.

11:32.390 --> 11:34.960
Don't get me wrong,

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
I'm not asking for horrific,
face-melting hell dreams.

11:42.170 --> 11:46.670
So maybe you need
a rest, too.

11:51.880 --> 11:55.180
Is that a yes or a no?

11:58.150 --> 12:00.690
I still have no idea what
you're trying to tell me.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.620
[electricity surges]

12:02.660 --> 12:05.660
[slow music playing]

12:11.360 --> 12:13.760
Oh, this is new.

12:16.640 --> 12:19.340
I remember this day.

12:19.370 --> 12:21.470
It was before the accident.

12:21.510 --> 12:24.910
One of our meet-ups.

12:24.940 --> 12:27.150
All right, fella,

12:27.180 --> 12:28.680
this might not
look like torture,

12:28.720 --> 12:33.490
but re-living one of my biggest
regrets is hell all the same.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.560
What are we doing here?

12:36.590 --> 12:38.930
Maybe it can be
different this time.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.390
What's the point of this thing?

12:40.430 --> 12:43.230
This isn't real.
It isn't even accurate.

12:43.260 --> 12:44.770
- Accurate?
- Yeah.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.130
You think you're so smart?

12:46.170 --> 12:51.170
How come all the details
are wrong?

12:51.910 --> 12:54.510
This pickup was blue,
not green.

12:54.540 --> 12:59.540
Hank Williams was on the radio
not whatever this is.

13:00.010 --> 13:05.010
John and I timed our rendezvous
to the 6:12 to Tulsa.

13:05.490 --> 13:08.520
Not a train in sight.

13:08.550 --> 13:10.060
Larry.

13:10.090 --> 13:14.460
Maybe you should try
just being here.

13:14.490 --> 13:17.700
It's fake.
It's all fake.

13:17.730 --> 13:20.030
What's this
supposed to be, huh?

13:20.070 --> 13:22.070
Is this the edge
of my memory?

13:22.100 --> 13:25.110
I guess you're not
all-seeing, are you?

13:25.140 --> 13:26.190
[gasps]

13:31.210 --> 13:33.410
What are you
trying to tell me?

13:33.450 --> 13:36.450
[electricity surges]

13:38.580 --> 13:40.620
[Hank Williams song playing]

13:40.650 --> 13:42.750
[bell dinging]

13:47.830 --> 13:50.730
Larry?

13:50.760 --> 13:52.970
Uh-huh.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.570
Maybe you should
just be here.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.970
Seems I don't have a choice.

14:00.010 --> 14:02.110
You say you love me,

14:02.140 --> 14:04.680
so spend time with me
right here,

14:04.710 --> 14:07.280
away from the world.

14:07.310 --> 14:11.720
All right, this can be
our stolen moment.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.390
[chuckles]

14:14.420 --> 14:19.420
Nice try, pal. Too bad you
missed the whole point.

14:20.030 --> 14:22.800
In what alt history
does John Bowers advocate

14:22.830 --> 14:24.930
for keeping
our relationship a secret?

14:24.970 --> 14:28.740
And memories shouldn't change just
because I want a happier ending.

14:28.770 --> 14:30.700
History doesn't change.

14:30.740 --> 14:31.940
I don't change.

14:31.970 --> 14:34.640
I'm still the gaslighting,
insecure hypocrite

14:34.680 --> 14:38.540
who ruined other peoples' lives
instead of owning my own shit.

14:38.580 --> 14:40.880
[panting]

14:40.910 --> 14:45.550
Holy brown shit.

14:45.580 --> 14:48.760
Don't interrupt me.

14:48.790 --> 14:50.890
If we're stuck
with each other,

14:50.920 --> 14:55.920
the least you can do
is understand me.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.100
Okay.

14:58.130 --> 15:00.430
We may share memories,

15:00.470 --> 15:04.940
but you have no idea how
hard it was living this way.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.910
The lies,

15:06.940 --> 15:09.010
the fear.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.440
The threat of
losing everything

15:10.480 --> 15:14.010
if anyone so much as
questioned my sexuality.

15:14.050 --> 15:19.050
You wanna fill in the margins
of this nightmare?

15:19.890 --> 15:21.720
Add the flight crew
locker room,

15:21.760 --> 15:24.390
the gay jokes
echoing off the walls.

15:24.420 --> 15:28.400
Add the two boys found dead and
hogtied outside Pendleton.

15:28.430 --> 15:31.060
You wanna know why
I couldn't be with John?

15:31.100 --> 15:34.300
You wanna know what's
missing from this fantasy?

15:34.330 --> 15:36.730
Fucking context!

15:41.340 --> 15:42.990
[John] Wow.

15:49.780 --> 15:54.780
You have no idea how long I
waited to hear those words.

15:55.090 --> 15:59.760
I'm preaching to the choir.

15:59.790 --> 16:03.830
No.

16:03.860 --> 16:08.860
I wanted you
to admit it to yourself.

16:18.610 --> 16:22.360
There's just one problem.

16:24.650 --> 16:28.550
You're missing the sunset.

16:44.540 --> 16:46.746
- [Cliff yelling] You think that's gonna hurt me.
- [energy charging]

16:46.770 --> 16:51.570
- [explosion]
- [glass shattering]

16:54.180 --> 16:57.320
All right, pal.

16:57.350 --> 17:01.850
You wanna be a hero,
go ahead.

17:03.590 --> 17:06.790
I wanna see the sunset.

17:06.829 --> 17:09.829
[electricity surges]

17:13.569 --> 17:16.640
Wiggle for me.

17:16.670 --> 17:18.640
Okay. No broken bones.

17:18.670 --> 17:20.410
It's just dislocated.

17:20.440 --> 17:24.040
I still remember the first
time I popped my shoulder.

17:24.079 --> 17:26.480
My old man had me
count to ten, and...

17:26.510 --> 17:28.720
- [Vic cries out in pain]
- [doctor] Oh!

17:28.750 --> 17:31.120
Oh. All done.

17:31.150 --> 17:34.620
Victor, my man.
You took that like a champ.

17:34.650 --> 17:35.960
He's gonna be fine.

17:35.990 --> 17:37.320
I'll go write up a script.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.160
Uh, no horseplay
until it's healed.

Okay. Thank you, Doctor.

17:41.630 --> 17:44.000
Of course.

Oh, poor baby.
Does it still hurt?

17:47.970 --> 17:51.040
Hey, there's no shame
in crying.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.810
It doesn't hurt.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.940
I'm scared.

17:56.980 --> 17:58.410
Of what, honey?

17:58.450 --> 18:02.280
Dad. He told me
not to climb the trees.

18:02.320 --> 18:07.320
So you understand
why he was worried now?

18:07.890 --> 18:09.620
Well, then,

18:09.660 --> 18:14.230
you know, we don't have to
tell your father everything.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.930

How's that sound?

18:16.960 --> 18:17.960
Okay?

<i>Cazh is a modern
swipe-based dating app.</i>

20:00.500 --> 20:03.800

And you can have it back.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.780
I re-programmed Grid.
I'm a closed system now.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.580
You should be proud of me, Dad.
I'm a self-taught hacker.

20:46.610 --> 20:49.950
You still haven't answered me. What gave
you the right to cut me off my own life?

20:49.980 --> 20:53.750
Three weeks after the accident,

Where's my daughter?

32:35.560 --> 32:38.190
Okay, you're Cliff.
You're Cliff. I get it.

32:38.230 --> 32:39.890
What the hell
are you doing in a robot?

32:39.930 --> 32:43.160
[Cliff] What the hell are you doing
calling yourself Clara's dad?

32:43.200 --> 32:44.630
How'd you brainwash her?

32:44.660 --> 32:46.070
Well, shit, you were dead!

32:46.100 --> 32:47.540
[Cliff] So you took my place?

32:47.570 --> 32:50.770
Of all the low life
back-stabbing shit...

32:50.800 --> 32:53.140
Hey, now.
You died, man.

32:53.170 --> 32:54.570
And you took Kate with you.

32:54.610 --> 32:56.780
That little girl
had nothing and no one.

32:56.810 --> 33:01.810
Besides, it ain't like I wanted
some brat dumped in my lap.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.180
[Cliff] Brat?

33:03.220 --> 33:05.820
That little snot-nose
killed my bachelor game, man.

33:05.850 --> 33:06.900
[spits]

33:10.920 --> 33:12.060
And you,

33:12.090 --> 33:13.890
you were alive
this whole time, huh?

33:13.930 --> 33:17.630
Yeah, probably neck deep
in robot pussy, you lucky bastard.

33:17.660 --> 33:21.000
But meanwhile, Bump Weathers is
stuck taking your kid to a shrink!

33:21.040 --> 33:22.840
So she can whine
about her dead mommy.

33:22.870 --> 33:26.110
- [groans]
- [Cliff] You son of a bitch, you stole my life!

33:26.140 --> 33:27.410
You ruined Clara!

33:27.440 --> 33:30.640
The least you can do
is be grateful for it.

33:30.680 --> 33:31.880
[cocks gun]

33:31.910 --> 33:34.510
You think that's
gonna hurt me?

33:34.550 --> 33:35.900
[screams]

33:47.190 --> 33:49.730
[Bump] You come into my house
and run up on me?

33:49.760 --> 33:52.270
[Cliff] What's a redneck
like you doing with all of these?

33:52.300 --> 33:53.900
Pretentious bastard!

33:53.930 --> 33:55.640
Suddenly you
become a father,

33:55.670 --> 33:58.140
and you start reading
<i>Canterbury Tales?</i>

33:58.170 --> 33:59.770
Illiterate shit heel!

33:59.810 --> 34:02.580
You're not fooling anyone!

34:02.610 --> 34:04.680
Careful, he's going nuts.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.450
Cliff!

34:06.480 --> 34:08.920
Cliff, what is wrong with you?

34:08.949 --> 34:12.020
[panting] Clara?

34:12.050 --> 34:15.320
Son of a... Illiterate...

34:15.350 --> 34:16.620
[groans]

34:16.659 --> 34:18.560
Where's Clara?

34:18.590 --> 34:19.989
[groans in confusion]

34:20.030 --> 34:24.969
Bump! Come here,
you little...

34:25.000 --> 34:26.300
[grunting]

34:26.330 --> 34:28.739
[Cliff] Where'd Bump go?
Where'd he go?

34:28.770 --> 34:32.070
Cliff! Snap out of it!

34:34.710 --> 34:38.010
[Cliff grunts] Wait...

34:40.780 --> 34:42.429
Wait, what?

34:49.690 --> 34:52.090
What is wrong with me?

34:52.130 --> 34:53.929
All I want to do is cry.

34:53.960 --> 34:56.929
My brain is screaming
for release.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.230
I'm so angry!

34:59.270 --> 35:01.030
Can't live like this!

35:01.070 --> 35:05.610
[screaming]

35:05.640 --> 35:08.180
Why do I want to beat the
shit out of Bump so bad?

35:08.210 --> 35:13.210
Irony is Bump Weathers was probably a
better dad to Clara than I would've been.

35:13.750 --> 35:15.920
Shit.

35:15.950 --> 35:18.450
I was already
turning into my old man.

35:18.490 --> 35:19.690
Oh!

35:19.720 --> 35:21.690
[groans in anguish]

35:21.720 --> 35:23.390
Shit's the same.

35:23.420 --> 35:27.090
Same fights,
same apologies over and over.

35:27.130 --> 35:29.530
A vicious cycle!

35:29.560 --> 35:32.130
Maybe Clara's lucky.
She got out.

35:32.170 --> 35:34.270
Maybe that's why
I can't call Clara.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.600
'Cause the second thing
I'm gonna have to explain

35:36.640 --> 35:39.610
after "How the fuck
am I alive"

35:39.640 --> 35:41.280
is why it's me.

35:41.310 --> 35:43.080
Why is it me,

35:43.110 --> 35:46.280
not her mom, who came back?

35:46.310 --> 35:48.880
It should've been Kate.

35:48.910 --> 35:53.720
Oh, God,
it should've been Kate!

35:55.020 --> 35:57.560
What in the hell
is going on?

35:57.590 --> 35:59.560
Cliff's having
a psychotic break.

35:59.590 --> 36:01.830
Look, maybe we should
just leave him alone.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.500
[Cliff] No!

36:03.530 --> 36:06.400
Please, I don't want to be alone
with my thoughts again. I...

36:06.430 --> 36:10.870
I can't be the only one
who needs to talk.

36:10.900 --> 36:13.269
Talking!
That's what we need.

36:13.270 --> 36:15.580
You're all just as
messed as I am, right?

36:15.610 --> 36:18.640
We need to talk
as a group!

36:18.680 --> 36:22.820
Like therapy?

36:22.850 --> 36:24.250
No, hard pass.

36:24.280 --> 36:27.590
[Cliff] It's what Niles
would do.

36:27.620 --> 36:31.790
Niles used to talk to us, right?
Like, well...

36:31.830 --> 36:33.390
Really, just listen.

36:33.430 --> 36:36.560
Come on, we have no idea
what's going on with each other.

36:36.600 --> 36:41.170
Look at Rita. Rita, what the
heck is going on with your legs?

36:41.200 --> 36:45.010
You can tell me,
you can tell us.

36:45.040 --> 36:49.610
I was stuck in a furnace, and
nobody could hear my screams.

36:49.640 --> 36:53.980
[Cliff] See? A powerful metaphor
for what we're all feeling.

36:54.010 --> 36:56.220
It was a literal furnace.

36:56.250 --> 36:59.450
[Cliff] Even better!
Literal furnaces!

36:59.490 --> 37:01.660
We need to talk
about this stuff.

37:01.690 --> 37:05.630
For God's sake, Cliff is
deranged, but he's right.

37:05.660 --> 37:10.360
This is exactly what doomed those
poor bastards in the Doom Patrol.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.730
Mr. Nobody turned them
against each other,

37:12.770 --> 37:15.900
using their secrets,
their lies,

37:15.940 --> 37:20.110
their anxieties,
and he's already doing it to us.

37:20.140 --> 37:22.640
He's doing it to me.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.180
If we have any chance
of making it through this,

37:25.210 --> 37:27.750
we need to start
talking to each other.

37:27.780 --> 37:29.780
[Cliff] Therapy.

37:29.820 --> 37:33.190
And I would rather eat hot coals
than talk about my problems.

37:33.220 --> 37:35.320
[Cliff] Therapy!

37:35.360 --> 37:37.860
And damn it, Cliff,
get a grip.

37:37.890 --> 37:40.290
[Cliff] Therapy!

37:49.500 --> 37:51.540
Well, this is fucking awkward.

37:51.570 --> 37:54.640
I just spilt my guts out.
Someone else talk.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.510
[Larry]
About what exactly?

37:56.540 --> 37:58.310
[Cliff] Stuff! Feelings.

37:58.350 --> 38:00.780
Let's go deep, get to the root
of our issues.

38:00.810 --> 38:03.420
Don't you wanna know
how your parents messed you up?

38:03.450 --> 38:06.750
I wanna know how
your parents messed you up.

38:06.790 --> 38:08.850
Fine, I'll go first.

38:08.890 --> 38:11.890
[Cliff] Second.

38:11.930 --> 38:13.060
[sighs]

38:13.090 --> 38:15.430
[clears throat]

38:15.460 --> 38:17.400
Ever since Niles was abducted

38:17.430 --> 38:21.030
and we went into
that donkey place,

38:21.070 --> 38:25.540
Mr. Nobody has been dangling
something terrible over me.

38:25.570 --> 38:29.310
A thing I did
a long time ago,

38:29.340 --> 38:32.310
great source of shame.

38:32.350 --> 38:35.420
And if we keep
looking for Niles,

38:35.450 --> 38:39.620
that thing is...

38:39.650 --> 38:41.820
Is going to come out.
And I don't know...

38:41.860 --> 38:43.659
[Cliff] Why don't you
just say it now?

38:43.660 --> 38:44.620
Excuse me?

38:44.621 --> 38:46.789
[Cliff] Rob it of its power
or whatever.

38:46.790 --> 38:47.790
I'm not ready.

38:47.791 --> 38:49.430
- [Cliff] Lame.
- Hey, let her talk.

38:49.460 --> 38:51.930
Come on, man,
this was your idea.

38:51.970 --> 38:53.370
[Cliff] I'm just saying.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.600
I'm sorry, okay, go ahead.
Rita, you were... Go ahead. Sorry. Sorry.

38:56.640 --> 39:01.340
All I know is that Rita
Farr was not a good person.

39:01.370 --> 39:03.509
In fact,

39:03.510 --> 39:05.810
she was never
a person at all.

39:05.850 --> 39:08.250
Rita was

39:08.280 --> 39:10.320
an illusion,

39:10.350 --> 39:13.019
made of light and celluloid

39:13.020 --> 39:16.360
and the best hair and
wardrobe in the business.

39:16.390 --> 39:21.390
And now, I have to
confront the truth.

39:25.630 --> 39:30.340
If there is no Rita Farr,

39:30.370 --> 39:35.240
then there's
nothing else there.

39:35.280 --> 39:37.480
I don't know what I am.

39:37.510 --> 39:39.280
I don't even know who I am.

39:39.310 --> 39:40.780
[bubbling]

39:40.810 --> 39:45.810
[Cliff] Holy shit. You just
talked your legs into being legs.

39:46.220 --> 39:48.260
[Rita gasps]

39:48.290 --> 39:50.260
Mmm.

39:50.290 --> 39:52.330
[Jane using posh accent]
Go, Rita.

39:52.360 --> 39:53.930
Hell of a performance, darling.

39:53.960 --> 39:57.530
Really your best work.
[chuckles wryly]

39:57.560 --> 40:00.330
You know what, Jane,
you can be a real bitch sometimes.

40:00.370 --> 40:02.140
[Cliff] Good, good, good.
This is all good.

40:02.170 --> 40:03.540
Dirty laundry,
airing it out.

40:03.570 --> 40:05.810
- Fuck off!
- [Cliff] Sunshine's the best disinfectant.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.410
[Jane and Rita]
Shut up, Cliff!

40:07.440 --> 40:11.190
[Cliff] Whoa. Group mind!

40:14.380 --> 40:15.719
[Larry] All right, this is
a waste of time.

40:15.720 --> 40:17.250
[Vic] You got somewhere
better to be?

40:17.280 --> 40:18.890
[Larry] Yes, actually, I do.

40:18.920 --> 40:21.690
[Cliff] What, your room? You have a
lover's quarrel with your flowers?

40:21.720 --> 40:24.160
Gotta go have make-up sex?

40:24.190 --> 40:25.489
[Jane chuckles]

40:25.490 --> 40:27.329
[Cliff] We can all hear you
yelling at yourself, pal.

40:27.330 --> 40:28.579
[Larry] At the spirit.

40:28.580 --> 40:34.230
[Cliff] So then maybe the two of you have
something you wanna get off your chest.

40:39.870 --> 40:43.880
[Larry] Okay.

40:43.910 --> 40:46.180
Well, I'm...

40:46.210 --> 40:48.650
- [Cliff] Gay!
- Whoa, whoa, settle down, buddy.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.580
[Cliff] What? Come on!
No judgment here.

40:50.620 --> 40:52.550
I just thought Larry
was about to come out,

40:52.590 --> 40:57.590
and it would've been
so healing for him.

40:58.790 --> 41:03.790
I think all I wanted
to say was...

41:05.500 --> 41:07.640
It gets lonely

41:07.670 --> 41:11.140
not touching anyone
for 60 years.

41:11.170 --> 41:14.740
The last person I ever
touched was John Bowers.

41:14.770 --> 41:16.140
I...

41:16.180 --> 41:17.610
I loved him.

41:17.640 --> 41:20.910
And I drove him away.

41:20.950 --> 41:24.050
[Cliff] I knew it.

41:24.080 --> 41:26.750
I just want you to know that
you're loved and accepted.

41:26.790 --> 41:27.850
[Larry] I'm not done.

41:27.890 --> 41:30.330
[Cliff] Oh, okay. All right.

41:30.360 --> 41:35.290
I'm only sharing this because it's the
thing Mr. Nobody shoved in my face.

41:35.330 --> 41:38.780
What's left of my face.

41:40.400 --> 41:43.670
[sighs]
That was a joke.

41:43.700 --> 41:47.040
These bandages are
the death of all nuance.

41:47.070 --> 41:51.710
Look, if Mr. Nobody's goal
is to torture me, well,

41:51.740 --> 41:53.110
I've been doing
his work for him.

41:53.150 --> 41:56.580
Whipping myself
in a prison of my own making.

41:56.620 --> 41:59.920
What if I'd trusted John?
What if I'd been more brave?

41:59.950 --> 42:02.520
And guess what?
I'm sick of it.

42:02.560 --> 42:06.760
I'm not just hurting myself,
I'm hurting this thing inside me,

42:06.790 --> 42:08.500
and it's hurting me back,
endlessly,

42:08.530 --> 42:13.530
until there's so much self-loathing
I can barely breathe.

42:32.620 --> 42:35.790
I killed my mom.

42:35.820 --> 42:40.820
[Cliff] Whoa. Winner winner,
chicken dinner. Here we go.

42:46.030 --> 42:49.170
My dad and I
don't talk about this.

42:49.200 --> 42:52.440
I was having an argument
with my mom about school.

42:52.470 --> 42:55.310
It seemed like
everything at the time,

42:55.340 --> 42:57.780
but it's so small now.

42:57.810 --> 43:02.310
Anyway, I got pissed and
lashed out about some BS.

43:02.350 --> 43:05.320
We were in my mom's home lab,

43:05.350 --> 43:10.350
chemicals,
a bunch of them. And...

43:13.960 --> 43:17.030
Boom.

43:17.060 --> 43:21.740
But to save me,
my dad, uh...

43:21.770 --> 43:26.470
He turned me into this.

43:26.510 --> 43:28.740
Thing is, that story,

43:28.780 --> 43:33.480
- my guilt, it used to be the well of my strength.
- [Cliff's knee shaking]

43:33.510 --> 43:36.480
It took me so long
to accept what happened

43:36.520 --> 43:38.020
and who I became.

43:38.050 --> 43:42.320
But, man, I thought Cyborg was a
way to make it all right again.

43:42.360 --> 43:43.860
Something's changed.

43:43.890 --> 43:46.790
Mr. Nobody, he put this
bug in my ear.

43:46.830 --> 43:48.260
Will you stop it?

43:48.290 --> 43:49.430
[Cliff] Sorry.

43:49.460 --> 43:52.230
If my brain and my operating
system are seamless,

43:52.270 --> 43:54.430
then how do I know
if my memories are real?

43:54.470 --> 43:56.400
[Cliff] Come on,
let's hit the gas!

43:56.440 --> 43:57.770
Get to the good stuff!

43:57.810 --> 43:59.510
Go deep, Vic. Deep!

43:59.540 --> 44:02.910
The thing
I can't shake is...

44:02.940 --> 44:05.580
What the hell could be worse
than me killing my own mother?

44:05.610 --> 44:10.080
And there is this tiny voice in my head
that believes Mr. Nobody when he says that

44:10.120 --> 44:13.520
my memories aren't real. Is that
the human part or is that my

44:13.550 --> 44:16.190
logic board
running game on my brain?

44:16.220 --> 44:18.790
As far as I can remember, I've
never really trusted my father.

44:18.830 --> 44:20.130
So that's not new,

44:20.160 --> 44:23.930
but suddenly,
I'm starting to question

44:23.960 --> 44:26.530
- why doesn't he trust me?
- [Jane whooshes]

44:26.570 --> 44:29.840
He shouldn't.
[chuckles coyly]

44:29.870 --> 44:32.420
My turn to share.

44:38.780 --> 44:41.310
[Vic] Hey, what is this?

44:41.350 --> 44:43.980
It's what Mr. Nobody
showed me in the donkey.

44:44.020 --> 44:45.719
- Why did you keep this hidden?
- [Cliff] Holy shit!

44:45.720 --> 44:47.220
Come now,
it's just a painting.

44:47.260 --> 44:49.689
What? You wanted secrets out in
the air, well, here's a big one.

44:49.690 --> 44:50.690
Don't be so vindictive.

44:50.720 --> 44:51.830
You made this up.

44:51.860 --> 44:53.530
The Hangman's Daughter
doesn't lie.

44:53.560 --> 44:56.430
[Larry] Well, this has
been productive.

44:56.460 --> 44:58.600
[chuckles] Oh, wow.

44:58.630 --> 45:01.570
You all need more therapy than
I do, and I'm the crazy one.

45:01.600 --> 45:03.600
[Cliff] Jane, get back here!

45:03.640 --> 45:05.970
Group isn't over
until you share.

45:06.010 --> 45:07.510
Who are you all of a sudden?

45:07.540 --> 45:11.080
[Cliff] You don't get to throw a
grenade into our therapy session

45:11.110 --> 45:12.710
and pretend that's helping.

45:12.750 --> 45:14.310
This isn't therapy!

45:14.350 --> 45:17.250
[Cliff] Maybe it's okay
if it's just talking.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.890
You of all people
need someone to talk to.

45:19.920 --> 45:21.060
I've seen your tapes.

45:21.090 --> 45:23.220
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

45:23.260 --> 45:24.260
[Cliff] You know.

45:24.290 --> 45:27.130
[scoffs] Man,
I can't take you seriously

45:27.160 --> 45:28.930
with all this tough love
paternal shit.

45:28.960 --> 45:31.759
[Cliff] Is there someone nicer in there
who can come out and explain to us

45:31.760 --> 45:33.570
how not to piss you off
all the time?

45:33.600 --> 45:35.740
Why?
You wouldn't listen anyway.

45:35.770 --> 45:38.070
[Cliff] Not sharing is a form
of self-isolation.

45:38.100 --> 45:39.310
You're not even listening now.

45:39.340 --> 45:41.809
[Cliff] Your mind
is a beautiful, strange place

45:41.810 --> 45:43.280
full of mystery.

45:43.310 --> 45:44.950
You don't wanna know
what I'm thinking.

45:44.980 --> 45:49.120
[Cliff] Come on, just say it!
It's a safe space!

45:49.150 --> 45:54.150
You'll never be a father
because you aren't even a man.

45:57.460 --> 46:00.490
[Cliff] I'm the only one here
who can stand you,

46:00.530 --> 46:05.330
and I only like
one 64th of you.

46:07.170 --> 46:10.570
Well, thank you
for your honesty.

46:10.600 --> 46:13.010
Jane. Jane, come back.

46:13.040 --> 46:16.379
[Larry] Jesus, Cliff.

46:16.380 --> 46:17.910
Ever heard of de-escalation?

46:17.950 --> 46:22.950
[Cliff] I didn't mean that.
Did I?

46:25.020 --> 46:26.650
Jane, don't leave.

46:26.690 --> 46:28.490
There's nowhere to go
from here but up.

46:28.520 --> 46:30.390
[Cliff] Jane, I'm sorry.

46:30.420 --> 46:32.060
I didn't mean to say that.

46:32.090 --> 46:34.760
I didn't even think
I was thinking that.

46:34.790 --> 46:37.600
What the... No!

46:37.630 --> 46:39.160
How did...

46:39.200 --> 46:41.030
Clara? Clara?

46:41.070 --> 46:43.170
[groans loudly] This is nuts.

46:43.200 --> 46:44.669
This is nuts!

46:44.670 --> 46:46.109
[Larry] Cliff's gone
off the deep end.

46:46.110 --> 46:47.540
[Vic] What if he's
having a stroke?

46:47.570 --> 46:49.610
[Cliff muttering]

46:49.640 --> 46:51.410
Would you have some sympathy?

46:51.450 --> 46:53.810
Nice going there, Beeboo.

46:53.850 --> 46:58.350
Cliff's the one goddamn reason we're
actually talking to each other.

46:58.390 --> 47:02.320
Yeah, way to screw the pooch with
your lady friend there, tug-a-nug.

47:02.360 --> 47:05.360
Maybe his crazy
is all our crazy.

47:05.390 --> 47:08.840
[babbling indistinctly]

47:11.700 --> 47:16.000
[laughing]

47:16.040 --> 47:19.170
I'll bump that face
off your punch!

47:19.200 --> 47:20.850
[screaming]

47:24.810 --> 47:27.580
Hold him down!

47:27.610 --> 47:28.980
There's something
wrong with him.

47:29.020 --> 47:31.550
No, he's just grieving.

47:31.580 --> 47:34.450
[whirring noises]

47:34.490 --> 47:36.440
[powers down]

47:43.400 --> 47:46.730
Oh... Ugh.

47:46.770 --> 47:49.170
[rat chittering]

47:53.670 --> 47:56.520
[groans in disgust]

48:00.480 --> 48:02.420
- [Jane] Honk, honk.
- [Larry] Is that my bus?

48:02.450 --> 48:04.650
[Rita] What on Earth
are you doing?

48:04.680 --> 48:06.150
[Jane] What are we doing?

48:06.190 --> 48:07.390
We're going into town.

48:07.420 --> 48:12.420
- [Cliff] I'm in.
- [rat chittering]

48:19.300 --> 48:24.170
[screaming]

48:24.200 --> 48:25.910
MAN: <i>Oh, little one.</i>

48:25.940 --> 48:28.510
<i>Such heartbreak,
such sorrow.</i>

48:28.540 --> 48:30.910
<i>Luckily, you don't
have to go it alone.</i>

48:30.940 --> 48:33.880
<i>You have me.</i>

48:33.910 --> 48:35.820
<i>Up here, the narrator.</i>

48:35.850 --> 48:37.420
[rat chittering]

48:37.450 --> 48:41.090
<i>Ugh. Look, let's just focus
on the sorrow.</i>

48:41.120 --> 48:43.860
<i>Okay? Let it well up
inside of you,</i>

48:43.890 --> 48:48.890
<i>nurture it, feel it harden into that
icy cold blade called vengeance.</i>

48:49.560 --> 48:52.570
[rat chittering]

48:52.600 --> 48:55.070
[narrator] <i>My God,
who told you that?</i>

48:55.100 --> 48:58.470
<i>Your dead country-mouse
mom over there?</i>

48:58.510 --> 49:01.870
<i>Enough with home-spun
cornpone bullshit.</i>

49:01.910 --> 49:03.880
<i>A wrong has been committed,</i>

49:03.910 --> 49:06.210
<i>and there's only one way
to set it right.</i>

49:06.250 --> 49:08.450
<i>You need to find
the thoughtless cretin</i>

49:08.480 --> 49:11.080
<i>responsible for
your mother's annihilation,</i>

49:11.120 --> 49:14.850
<i>and then you need to fuck
his mind, fuck his heart,</i>

49:14.890 --> 49:18.090
<i>and fuck his soul.</i>

49:18.120 --> 49:20.690
<i>Think you can do that,
little fella?</i>

49:20.730 --> 49:21.930
[chuckles]

49:21.960 --> 49:24.810
[groans in disgust]

49:29.600 --> 49:32.000
[rat chittering]

49:46.450 --> 49:48.850
[rat chittering]

49:58.030 --> 49:59.200
[knocking on door]

49:59.230 --> 50:01.430
[Vic] Good morning, Rita.
Team meeting in 15.
