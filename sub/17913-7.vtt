00:14.120 --> 00:17.680
So you invited me
all the way across town...

00:17.760 --> 00:19.720
to tell me that you have
a venereal disease?

00:21.360 --> 00:23.480
Yep. Pretty much.

00:23.560 --> 00:26.080
Cool that you feel
that you can share that with me.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.160
How's it been?

00:27.240 --> 00:30.560
Is it an itchy one
or a scary one or... what?

00:30.640 --> 00:35.000
Yeah. Thing is, erm, you might want
to get tested for it too, Jonesy.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.240
- What with...
- With what?

00:37.320 --> 00:38.440
You know. [Chuckles]

00:38.520 --> 00:40.000
Not sure that I do know...

00:40.080 --> 00:42.200
What with us having sex. [Chuckles]

00:45.880 --> 00:49.360
Um, Dylan, we've never had sex.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.000
[door opens]

01:17.080 --> 01:18.400
Angus is here. I'm making waffles.

01:20.840 --> 01:21.960
Waffles, Dylan.

01:24.320 --> 01:25.440
That ain't your waffle face.

01:25.520 --> 01:26.960
How do I do this?

01:27.040 --> 01:29.840
I... I can't get her out of my head
and now there's this.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.160
[sighs] All right.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.080
Waffles might be a start.

01:36.160 --> 01:38.280
Maybe not a long-term solution, but...

01:42.600 --> 01:43.760
[Angus] Morning!

01:43.840 --> 01:45.680
I was just telling Luke about my sperm.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.440
- How are the little fellas doing?
- Not good.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.760
There's plenty of them
and they're good at swimming,

01:50.840 --> 01:52.360
but they're terrible with directions.

01:52.440 --> 01:55.960
None of them can find the egg.
They keep going round in circles.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.800
It's incredibly depressing...
for them and me.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.480
[exhales] Parlez-vous.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.640
Let's go out.
We all need a night out.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.200
- Definitely. Pub?
- No. No. I need a change of scene.

02:07.280 --> 02:10.080
Something that isn't listening
to noise records in my room

02:10.160 --> 02:11.240
or moping over a pint.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.400
I want to go out like
a premiership footballer does.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.360
- Or... or a pirate.
- [gasps]

02:16.440 --> 02:19.160
I don't want to think about it.
I need to have a massively good time.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.000
A lads' night out...

02:21.080 --> 02:22.320
with raucousness.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.400
- Are you allowed?
- Well, nothing else has worked.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.000
Maybe my sperms are stressed.

02:26.080 --> 02:29.600
Maybe a few drinks could loosen them up
and get them thinking about Helen's eggs.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.200
Are you with me?

02:31.280 --> 02:32.280
Do you need to ask?

02:32.360 --> 02:33.680
No, but it's polite.

02:33.760 --> 02:36.280
Well, thank you. I gratefully accept.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.440
[laughing]

02:42.080 --> 02:46.320
So... what is the secret
to a long and happy marriage?

02:46.400 --> 02:48.000
[Fiona] Ooh, my goodness.

02:48.080 --> 02:51.640
Well, the key thing is listening
to each other.

02:52.320 --> 02:53.560
And swinging.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.040
[Mal] Oh, God.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.680
[laughing] He's joking.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.320
[laughing] Oh, no, right.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.720
Richard wouldn't last five minutes
at a sex party.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.560
He'd be thrown out
for discussing the rugby.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.640
[both laugh]

03:04.960 --> 03:08.360
- Now, I'd just like to take a moment to...
- [whispers] He's actually standing up.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.000
raise a glass to the happy couple.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.440
[sighs]

03:19.640 --> 03:22.760
Er, I've completely lost
my train of thought.

03:23.480 --> 03:27.240
But the general thrust was,
here's to the pair of you.

03:27.320 --> 03:28.680
- [Fiona laughs]
- [Evie chuckles]

03:28.760 --> 03:30.280
To Malcolm and Evie.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.400
Evie.

03:31.480 --> 03:32.960
- [Richard laughs]
- [Fiona] Cheers.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.480
- Well done, darling.
- Oh, yes.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.280
It was very moving.

03:40.440 --> 03:44.560
Now, before we go, have you made contact
with the village church yet?

03:44.640 --> 03:46.480
The reverend's expecting you.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.760
Oh, erm, well, we're actually
getting married in the city.

03:55.600 --> 03:56.800
[Mal] Er, well...

03:56.880 --> 03:59.800
Erm... Mum and Dad suggested
we do it at theirs.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.240
- Marquee in the garden.
- Er...

04:03.600 --> 04:05.920
Er, that sounds very nice,

04:06.000 --> 04:08.920
but it's also the exact opposite
of what we've already agreed.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.240
Well, nothing's booked.
It's not a big deal.

04:11.320 --> 04:14.240
Well, the marquee is
at least partly booked.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.040
We had to put a deposit down for it.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.920
And for the brass band.
Tell me you've discussed the brass band.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.640
- Trumpets and tubas and stuff?
- Erm...

04:21.720 --> 04:23.880
Oh, yes, well, so you have discussed it.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.040
A brass band?

04:25.120 --> 04:26.920
Something for the older generation.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.680
- I wish you'd let me brush your hair.
- My hair's fine.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.760
- Would have taken me two minutes, mate.
- Oh, it's like a temple of fun!

04:56.840 --> 04:59.640
There's booze. There's people
in their finery. There's gambling.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.600
Oh, it's like a James Bond film
without the sex and violence.

05:02.680 --> 05:05.040
Okay. Saddle up, gentlemen.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.560
We're about to take down
the king of games, roulette.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.640
So named because it'll rue the day...

05:11.720 --> 05:14.200
it let me spin its shiny, shiny wheel.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.120
Go big or go home.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.640
Whoa! Put the boys to bed.
It's man hour.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.320
That's fucking great game chat, Angus.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.400
I'm proud of you, man.
Well done. Well done, baby.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.200
No more bets.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.440
Yes.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.760
[croupier] Seventeen black.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.120
- Was that going big?
- Yes. I went big.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.360
That was my entire stack.

05:44.440 --> 05:45.920
Now that you've gone big,
are you gonna go home?

05:47.440 --> 05:49.400
You need to listen to Angus
about game chat, okay?

05:49.480 --> 05:51.520
This guy's putting
his heart and soul into it.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.600
- Shape up, Dylan.
- Sorry.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.680
We're on a lads' night out.

05:53.760 --> 05:54.840
- Shape up. Understand?
- Yep.

05:56.320 --> 05:57.560
Sorry.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.840
[Evie] Getting married in the city is
the one thing that we agreed.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.960
[Mal] Well, not agreed. Discussed.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.720
And it's a really good marquee.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.280
So you've already seen pictures?

06:09.360 --> 06:11.200
[scoffs] Wow.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.520
Well, I can forward you the e-mail...
Or not.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.120
Look, it's just an option.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.600
And who wants that option?
Apart from your mum and dad.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.280
So you're leaning towards a city wedding?

06:19.360 --> 06:22.520
I'm leaning towards
feeling extremely frustrated with you.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.920
Maybe the feeling's mutual.

06:31.480 --> 06:32.600
[Dylan] Hmm.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.640
And I'll hold.

06:36.720 --> 06:39.520
- Who holds on a 12?
- It felt risky.

06:40.360 --> 06:41.400
[exclaims]

06:41.480 --> 06:43.640
You promised you'd go big.
How was that going big?

06:43.720 --> 06:45.760
I was under a lot of pressure!
I made a call!

06:45.840 --> 06:49.560
[sighs] What's happened to us?
How did we forget how to do this?

06:49.640 --> 06:52.160
Angus is drinking rosé.
You're holding on a 12.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.800
I also have ordered a glass of rosé.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.240
We're supposed to be partying
like pirates.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.280
Dylan? Luke?

06:57.360 --> 06:59.240
- Ah!
- Jonesy?

06:59.320 --> 07:00.680
- [Jonesy laughing]
- What are you doing here?

07:01.720 --> 07:04.440
I'm playing Lady Luck
to some fella that I'm dating.

07:04.520 --> 07:06.120
I say dating. It's more like seeing.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.240
- [Dylan] Hmm.
- Seeing sometimes.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.400
- Are you stalking him?
- Yeah. Yeah.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.760
Stand there while
I peek over your shoulder.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.680
- [both laugh]
- Oh, it's brilliant to see you guys!

07:15.760 --> 07:17.960
- How long has it been?
- Since uni maybe?

07:18.040 --> 07:20.760
Pretty sure last time I saw you,
you were wrapped in a Spanish flag

07:20.840 --> 07:22.080
- catching olives in your mouth.
- [laughs]

07:22.160 --> 07:23.600
Yeah, hardly narrows it down.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.240
- Oh, classic Jonesy.
- So what are you doing these days?

07:26.320 --> 07:29.760
- I am drinking tequila with you guys.
- Now we're talking!

07:29.840 --> 07:31.520
- Come on!
- Do you wanna bring your date?

07:31.600 --> 07:33.160
- I don't!
- Okay.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.760
- I'll just tell Angus.
- [all cheering]

07:35.840 --> 07:38.000
Eh... I'll catch you guys up.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.920
I keep rolling the dice
and shouting numbers

07:48.000 --> 07:50.120
and everyone thinks
I'm doing a good job of it.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.440
I have no idea how the game works.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.920
- Are those all yours?
- Erm, oh, I think so.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.520
Unless I'm looking after them
for everyone.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.960
- [huffs]
- Do you know the rules?

07:58.040 --> 08:00.440
Everyone seems to be worried
about something called "snake eyes."

08:00.520 --> 08:02.840
Forget the rules, dude.
You're on a fucking streak!

08:02.920 --> 08:06.440
You ride those dice
all the way home to mamacita!

08:06.520 --> 08:09.080
- [blows]
- [dice clatter]

08:09.160 --> 08:11.040
- [both] Yeah!
- [all cheering]

08:14.840 --> 08:16.400
We... we could compromise.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.440
What is the compromise
between a city wedding

08:18.520 --> 08:20.280
and a marquee in the countryside?

08:20.360 --> 08:22.480
- A garage in the suburbs?
- They've paid the deposit.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.720
How about we keep the marquee
but you choose the music?

08:24.800 --> 08:27.360
[laughs] Is that a joke?

08:27.440 --> 08:29.240
Nothing's been finalized.
No firm decisions.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.720
Thanks for keeping me in the loop. [Sighs]

08:32.960 --> 08:35.799
Do you know what? I'm out of here.
There's a firm decision for you.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.000
Don't be childish.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.240
Me, childish?

08:39.320 --> 08:43.039
You're a policeman in his 30s
that can't say no to his parents.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.720
[chuckles] I'm not going to eat you.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.600
This is the only place
where there aren't any cameras.

08:56.680 --> 08:59.240
If I paid bar prices
every time I went out...

09:00.320 --> 09:01.440
I'd have to sell a kidney.

09:01.520 --> 09:03.280
I don't think they'd accept
one of yours, Jonesy.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.360
[laughs sarcastically]

09:05.080 --> 09:07.440
Mmm. Thanks.
This is helping.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.080
- Helping what?
- I'm trying to move on from someone.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.800
Ooh, who?

09:11.880 --> 09:12.840
Evie.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.760
Evie? [Inhales sharply]

09:15.840 --> 09:18.200
- Oh, that's brutal.
- [chuckles]

09:18.280 --> 09:20.720
- Good luck.
- Thanks. Mmm.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.560
This feels like movement.

09:22.640 --> 09:26.040
So... give me a kiss.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.880
Just doing my bit for the cause.
Keeping you... moving.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.360
[people cheering]

09:51.720 --> 09:53.560
Go all in for a big finish.

09:56.920 --> 09:57.960
Uh...

09:58.040 --> 09:59.280
All of it?

09:59.360 --> 10:00.760
[Luke] Do it, dude.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.720
Double it or kiss it goodbye.
It doesn't get any bigger than this.

10:03.800 --> 10:04.800
It's what lads do, isn't it?

10:05.760 --> 10:07.680
It's what fucking pirates would do!

10:07.760 --> 10:08.960
Yes.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.120
I'm doing it.

10:11.680 --> 10:17.240
All of it.
Everything on the next roll!

10:17.320 --> 10:19.040
Ah! [Panting]

10:20.560 --> 10:21.560
Yeah?

10:22.320 --> 10:23.320
[blows]

10:23.400 --> 10:24.400
[grunts softly]

10:26.080 --> 10:27.200
[whispering] Come on.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.720
[exhales sharply]

10:47.680 --> 10:48.800
Did I get snake face?

10:49.800 --> 10:50.920
Dude.

10:52.440 --> 10:53.520
You won.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.120
- Yeah!
- [all cheering]

11:02.480 --> 11:03.880
[upbeat music playing]

11:03.960 --> 11:06.720
£2,500 in cash. [Chuckles]

11:06.800 --> 11:09.000
I can't put it in my bank account.
Helen would notice.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.720
Well, she doesn't know I'm here.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.920
I told her there was
a database crisis at work.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.880
"Database Crisis" sounds like
a band Dylan would like.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.520
[laughs]

11:17.600 --> 11:19.200
[Angus] What shall I do with the money?

11:19.280 --> 11:22.440
You could dig a lot of wells in places
that don't have enough wells.

11:22.520 --> 11:25.120
Or you could invest it.
I know a couple of great tech start-ups

11:25.200 --> 11:26.360
that are crowdfunding.

11:27.240 --> 11:30.400
- You guys are the worst lads ever!
- Why?

11:30.480 --> 11:31.840
I mean, yes, but what's your take?

11:31.920 --> 11:34.920
One day, you're gonna be old,
looking back on your lives,

11:35.000 --> 11:36.960
and this night is gonna be
yet another night

11:37.040 --> 11:40.880
where you went for the solid, safe,
reliable, kill-me-now option.

11:40.960 --> 11:44.520
So, no, you are not going to invest it
or give it to charity,

11:44.600 --> 11:47.480
or bank it or spend
one more minute looking at it.

11:47.560 --> 11:51.280
You are going to blow that
on cocaine and hookers!

11:55.440 --> 11:57.640
- Strippers and champagne?
- [inhales sharply]

11:57.720 --> 11:58.720
Ooh.

11:58.800 --> 12:02.800
Jonesy, you are like
the patron saint of partying.

12:02.880 --> 12:06.880
One night...
Two and a half grand to burn!

12:06.960 --> 12:08.280
[Jonesy grunting]

12:08.360 --> 12:09.760
Devastation!

12:09.840 --> 12:11.560
- [Dylan] Whoo!
- All right, you!

12:11.640 --> 12:14.760
We want your most expensive
bottle of tequila,

12:14.840 --> 12:19.840
every lemon you possess
and a bucket in case I throw up.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.360
[all] Yeah!
[Luke] Fuck yeah!

12:26.760 --> 12:28.040
[doorbell rings]

12:35.760 --> 12:36.920
[cell phone ringing]

12:40.760 --> 12:41.760
[indistinct]

12:41.840 --> 12:43.000
I'll be back in a sec.

12:44.520 --> 12:45.760
How's it going with the parents?

12:45.840 --> 12:47.440
They having second thoughts about you?

12:47.520 --> 12:49.400
Where are you guys?
I want to come out.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.560
Uh... we're not really doing anything fun.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.280
Ah, this is brilliant.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.080
- Sounds like it's brilliant.
- Yeah, er...

12:57.160 --> 12:58.960
It's really just a lads' night out.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.960
- Where are you?
- We're going to a strip club.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.600
- It'll be disgusting and disappointing.
- Which one?

13:03.680 --> 13:06.000
My phone battery's about to run out,
so write this down quickly.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.120
In about 15 minutes
we're leaving to go to...

13:08.200 --> 13:10.280
Lu... Luke? Luke?

13:10.360 --> 13:12.080
[Luke grunts] Top me up.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.480
- Who was that?
- Er, wrong number.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.400
- You were talking to them for a long time.
- They were very persistent.

13:17.480 --> 13:18.480
- [Angus chuckling]
- [cell phone ringing]

13:18.560 --> 13:20.280
[Dylan] Ooh. Hold on.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.720
Yeah, I'm confiscating that.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.600
Real lads don't take phone calls.

13:23.680 --> 13:24.800
Jonesy!

13:24.880 --> 13:26.920
- Lead us to our doom!
- [all whooping]

13:27.000 --> 13:28.360
Come on!

13:32.120 --> 13:33.400
[hip-hop music playing]

13:33.480 --> 13:36.520
Overpriced champagne
and you get to throw money at people.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.200
This is the place
to burn a couple of grand.

13:39.280 --> 13:42.040
You had me at champagne.
Let's get this party started!

13:42.120 --> 13:43.280
[all] Whoo!

13:43.360 --> 13:44.520
Oh. Hello.

13:44.600 --> 13:48.040
So do we buy our drugs off you
or is there another system here?

13:48.120 --> 13:49.520
I think you've had your fun
for the night.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.800
Hey, Curly.
Show the man some love.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.560
- With a hug?
- With some of that sweet bankroll.

13:55.840 --> 13:56.920
Do you take bribes?

14:00.640 --> 14:01.840
All right. Enjoy your evening.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.720
- How much did you give him there?
- £240.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.520
Ooh, the girls are gonna love you.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.000
- Who wants flaming sambucas?
- [Dylan] Light me up!

14:10.080 --> 14:13.040
Okay, for me, that was too big.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.080
- Smaller bribes from now on?
- I think so, yeah.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.600
Yeah, just... just take 'em down
a notch or two, Angus.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.320
- All right, mate?
- Okay.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.720
[hip-hop music playing]

14:26.920 --> 14:29.640
So, what have you been doing
the last few years?

14:29.720 --> 14:30.840
This.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.040
[laughing]

14:35.800 --> 14:39.320
Do you know there's a ridiculous amount
of free money behind the bar?

14:39.400 --> 14:41.520
[Jonesy] Yeah, I do it on principle.
[Angus] This is amazing.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.280
It's like a bar where all the girls
have taken their clothes off.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.920
Excuse me, could we have, uh,
burritos for everyone, please?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.960
Thank you very much.
Now that shit's rock and roll. [Laughs]

14:50.040 --> 14:53.080
Excuse me. [Stammers] What's the quickest
way to waste money here?

14:53.160 --> 14:55.360
I don't actually know.
It's my first week here.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.120
- Oh, well done.
- Oh, thanks.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.760
Erm, but I guess champagne
and a lot of private dances?

14:59.840 --> 15:02.760
Okay, well, we will have
four bottles of champagne

15:02.840 --> 15:04.240
and four straws.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.760
Oh, how much is a dance?

15:05.840 --> 15:08.040
£50. Do you want one?

15:09.160 --> 15:11.920
- I'd like to dance.
- I can give you one.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.080
Erm... you have to sit still, though.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.520
[chuckles] Okay.

15:16.560 --> 15:20.320
That's not... You're not actually gonna...
There's no way you're going...

15:20.400 --> 15:22.080
Does he know what...

15:25.440 --> 15:27.400
[hip-hop music continues playing]

15:30.400 --> 15:31.400
Ah...

15:31.480 --> 15:34.320
Yes, this place does nothing for me,
if I'm honest.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.680
It's not...

15:36.960 --> 15:39.520
I'm just saying, this...
this place does nothing for me.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.000
Really, it's not even...

15:41.080 --> 15:43.920
- ["Funky Cold Medina" playing]
- The tunes are good though.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.880
Yeah, it'd be rude not to, wouldn't it?

15:48.960 --> 15:51.200
["Funky Cold Medina" continues playing]

16:23.600 --> 16:27.200
- Is that Jonesy with Dylan? What...
- Irrelevant. What are you doing here?

16:27.280 --> 16:29.520
I had to look in two other strip clubs
to find you.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.880
One gave me an application form.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.280
- Good to know I have options.
- [chuckles]

16:32.360 --> 16:34.640
Well, I told you you'd hate it.
Probably best go home, eh?

16:34.720 --> 16:36.000
Stop trying to get rid of me.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.120
- Fine. Dance with me.
- Can we talk?

16:38.200 --> 16:41.320
- I would rather talk.
- We'll talk while we jive.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.640
We could go back to my place.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.000
No, I don't want to do
the whole waking up thing.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.600
Um, I'll make you eggs.

16:46.680 --> 16:48.880
- Are you in love with me?
- I don't think so.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.680
So shut up about eggs.

16:50.760 --> 16:54.280
What do you really,
actually want to do right now?

16:54.360 --> 16:56.240
I'm happy to go with your suggestion.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.480
Step into my office.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.560
[slow R&B music playing]

17:14.359 --> 17:15.560
[chuckles]

17:16.200 --> 17:18.040
- I'm Holly.
- Angus.

17:18.119 --> 17:21.520
Oh.
Can you tell me if I'm doing this right?

17:22.319 --> 17:25.000
Oh, I... I can't.
I've got nothing to benchmark it against.

17:25.079 --> 17:26.880
They don't exactly give you
any training. [Chuckles]

17:26.960 --> 17:29.320
- [stammering] How did you get the job?
- It turned up.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.360
Oh, well,
I think you're doing brilliantly.

17:31.440 --> 17:34.480
Thanks. They did say by two minutes in
I should be naked.

17:34.560 --> 17:37.080
- Are you timing us?
- No.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.800
- Would you like me to?
- Do you mind?

17:39.880 --> 17:42.720
Oh, I can put the countdown timer
on my phone. It will buzz.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.360
[both breathing heavily]

18:01.360 --> 18:02.680
Are you still thinking about Evie?

18:05.080 --> 18:06.320
Well, I am now.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.840
[clicks tongue]

18:07.920 --> 18:09.520
I didn't think that one through.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.320
[clicks tongue] Oh...

18:14.640 --> 18:16.800
No, let's do this.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.560
- I... What?
- [scoffs]

18:18.640 --> 18:22.560
My friend Jason, who's like...
my alcohol sensei...

18:23.160 --> 18:25.200
He said that you should drink
until you can't

18:25.280 --> 18:27.520
- remember the night you've just had.
- Mmm.

18:27.600 --> 18:31.080
But not drink if you're trying to forget
the day ahead of you.

18:31.960 --> 18:35.600
Look, Evie is getting married
and that is a big deal.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.440
You only do that two or three times.

18:37.520 --> 18:42.120
You, my friend... You're gonna have
to start pointing yourself forward.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.520
Life's too short to just keep
going round in circles.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.800
[softly] Yeah.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.080
You're right.

18:48.800 --> 18:52.240
You're completely, completely right.
[slurring] You just... It makes sense.

18:52.320 --> 18:56.640
I just have to go
to sleep now for a little...

18:56.720 --> 18:59.680
little bit, but it makes sense.
I am...

18:59.760 --> 19:01.520
Can you e-mail me
everything you just said?

19:01.600 --> 19:03.920
I just don't want to forget about...

19:04.000 --> 19:05.600
Hmm...

19:05.680 --> 19:07.920
- Can I draw on your face?
- [snorts]

19:09.160 --> 19:10.960
I think that's a yes.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.520
I mean, he's just doing it
because his parents are telling him to.

19:14.600 --> 19:15.760
If he's struggling to say no,

19:15.840 --> 19:17.640
it's not necessarily
because he wants to annoy you.

19:17.720 --> 19:19.280
Maybe he wants a country wedding.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.640
Maybe it's you
he's struggling to say no to.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.200
Thanks, chief. Put that on the tab.

19:23.280 --> 19:24.960
You've spent it.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.360
- All of it?
- [mouths] All of it.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.680
[huffs] Amazing.

19:28.760 --> 19:32.880
[inhales sharply] Uh, Eves...
I am a little bit maxed out at the moment,

19:32.960 --> 19:35.440
how would you feel
about popping that on the old plastic?

19:41.200 --> 19:42.400
[sighs]

19:42.480 --> 19:43.800
Thank you.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.080
One more burrito, please, mate.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.320
What?

19:49.400 --> 19:51.400
[slow R&B music playing]

19:53.320 --> 19:56.040
So... Taking off the bra in a second.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.120
Ooh, it's a big moment.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.640
Yeah, I've only brought people drinks.
It's a big step onwards.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.760
Oh, well, you don't have to.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.600
- I think it's expected.
- You could tell them I asked you not to.

20:05.680 --> 20:08.080
I just need to build
a bit of momentum up, you know.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.680
Erm, would you mind some chitchat?

20:10.520 --> 20:11.800
Okay. Um...

20:12.720 --> 20:15.400
- How was your day?
- Good. Yeah.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.040
Uni was interesting.

20:17.120 --> 20:20.640
- Oh, what are you studying?
- Computational mathematics.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.720
Comp ems?

20:22.480 --> 20:24.960
- Do you know the subject?
- Know it? I lived it.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.280
For three years.
Loved every second of it. [Gasps]

20:28.280 --> 20:29.680
That was unexpected.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.560
I thought it might be better
as a surprise.

20:31.640 --> 20:34.000
You know, like, if I jumped out at you
from behind a bush.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.800
It worked. [Chuckles]

20:39.240 --> 20:41.200
- This is really sexy.
- [both chuckle]

20:41.280 --> 20:44.360
Oh. [Gasps]
Am I allowed to have an erection?

20:44.960 --> 20:46.920
I'm sorry if it's not allowed.
It just happened.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.640
It's because you're gorgeous
and you love maths.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.960
You have really amazing eyes.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.040
My heart's beating really fast.

20:57.280 --> 20:58.800
Yeah, mine, too.

21:06.320 --> 21:07.400
[chuckles]

21:08.600 --> 21:10.360
[Luke] Ah, this looks promising.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.920
- Where's Jonesy?
- I've moved on from Evie, Luke.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.120
It's all going to be fine.
Ask Jonesy.

21:15.200 --> 21:18.040
Uh, hold that thought,
because Evie is here.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.440
Don't... Don't panic.

21:19.520 --> 21:22.640
On the upside, we're being thrown out.
Angus had sex with a stripper.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.360
[laughs]

21:24.440 --> 21:26.080
We weren't having sex,
we were making love.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.840
- Out you go.
- I thought we were bribery friends.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.200
- I want my money back.
- You are not allowed to touch the girls.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.840
- They're not whores.
- How dare you call her that!

21:31.920 --> 21:34.000
[Evie] Angus!
Stop it! Let's just go!

21:34.080 --> 21:35.880
Can someone give Holly my number?

21:35.960 --> 21:37.960
It's 079-77...

21:38.040 --> 21:39.920
Why isn't anyone writing this down?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.160
079-77...

21:42.160 --> 21:44.120
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.480
Don't come any closer.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
[crowd exclaims]

21:51.920 --> 21:53.160
[stuttering]

21:56.280 --> 21:58.320
Helen's bound to find out, isn't she?

21:58.400 --> 22:01.120
I'm going to end up with a conviction
for criminal damage!

22:01.200 --> 22:03.200
We went pretty big, didn't we?

22:03.280 --> 22:04.680
Oh, we took it to the biggest.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.320
In the moment, though...

22:06.400 --> 22:08.280
I swear it felt like love.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.240
Does it matter that it's wrong?

22:11.160 --> 22:12.920
[stutters] I should care.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.800
Well, I don't! It was fantastic!

22:15.880 --> 22:16.920
[Angus chuckles]

22:17.000 --> 22:19.720
What's that say about me?
Does that matter?

22:23.480 --> 22:24.920
[sighs]

22:25.000 --> 22:26.320
How're you doing, Dyl?

22:27.680 --> 22:29.320
I'm gonna be fine.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.360
[Pete] It's a full house,
so we put them in the corridor.

22:47.440 --> 22:50.360
- Thanks for writing that off, Pete.
- Aye, no problems, mate.

22:51.720 --> 22:53.200
[cell door unlocking]

23:03.400 --> 23:05.120
[Evie] I shouldn't have run off like that.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.840
It's... an old habit.
Probably not a good one.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.200
I just want us both to be happy.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.240
You make it sound easy.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.840
It's not though, is it?
It's work.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.440
Are you still up for that?

23:24.560 --> 23:25.680
Yeah.

23:37.640 --> 23:39.160
So where did you end up that night?

23:39.240 --> 23:42.320
Well, technically, I was still on a date,

23:42.400 --> 23:44.720
so I went back to the casino
to find him.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.440
- [laughs]
- He hadn't even noticed I was gone.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.560
Yeah. He was a real keeper.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.040
You seem a lot happier.

23:52.120 --> 23:53.800
Yeah. Getting there.

23:53.880 --> 23:56.440
I'm just sorry I forgot all your advice.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.640
Oh, shit, yeah,
I was meant to e-mail you...

23:59.720 --> 24:01.760
But then, well, you know.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.280
- Life.
- I know.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.760
This is a welcome reminder.
Timely... you know?

24:07.840 --> 24:09.720
And did you meet someone else?

24:11.200 --> 24:12.240
Yeah.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.920
Yeah, I did, I met...
I met someone really great.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.760
Well, when that goes tits up,
you know where to find me.

24:19.840 --> 24:22.840
- Around and about, and usually out.
- [both laugh]

24:25.320 --> 24:26.840
Classic Jonesy.

24:32.800 --> 24:36.520
- The world beyond Luke and Angus.
- Not that they're not enough for anyone.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.000
Absolutely.
They are high-quality people.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.560
- You'll like Evie.
- What if I don't?

24:42.800 --> 24:43.960
Can I send her back?

24:44.800 --> 24:46.000
I think you will.

24:47.680 --> 24:50.200
All this cheerfulness is
making me nervous.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.240
I'm just...
I'm happy to be here with you.

24:52.320 --> 24:56.040
Erm, you know, they'll like you
and you'll have a good time.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.240
What if I panic and I get too drunk,

24:58.320 --> 25:01.240
and I say terrible things
and throw up on people?

25:01.320 --> 25:03.680
- Then you'll fit right in.
- [laughs]

25:04.360 --> 25:06.200
It's Angus' divorce party.

25:06.280 --> 25:09.800
Why are you so cheerful?
It's like you know something.

25:09.880 --> 25:12.880
I'm... I'm just...
I'm honestly just happy.

25:12.960 --> 25:16.600
There's literally nothing on my mind.
No big questions.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.240
It's really quite a pleasant feeling,
actually.

25:19.320 --> 25:21.080
It's quite unnerving.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.440
I could get used to it.
