WEBVTT

00:44.244 --> 00:47.080
Lindsay, thank you so much
for coming.

00:47.113 --> 00:48.314
You want me to wait here?

00:48.782 --> 00:49.683
No.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.624
Well, so much
for "a better life

00:57.658 --> 00:59.560
awaits me
in California," huh?

01:00.360 --> 01:01.628
I don't know
if I can help you, Dennis.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.429
You're the only person
I could think of.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.298
As I told you over the phone,
there's probably not...

01:05.331 --> 01:06.600
I know what you said
over the phone...

01:06.633 --> 01:08.401
that your lawyers
haven't already tried.
Like the other lawyers,

01:08.434 --> 01:10.804
but I didn't do it.

01:13.273 --> 01:14.575
Okay.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.276
And my lawyer
is now telling me

01:16.309 --> 01:18.779
to consider pleading out
to murder two.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.414
I admit I don't know
that much about your case,

01:21.447 --> 01:24.818
but they found her body
in your car.

01:24.851 --> 01:28.154
I was framed, Lindsay.
I didn't even know that woman.

01:28.188 --> 01:30.256
I'm also told they have
letters from you to her.

01:30.290 --> 01:33.259
E-mails. We were
in the same chat room,

01:33.293 --> 01:35.629
but I never met her
in person.

01:35.662 --> 01:40.534
Well... a week
before the trial, I...

01:41.902 --> 01:44.437
I really don't think
I can help you.

01:45.872 --> 01:47.373
But you came.

01:47.874 --> 01:48.875
Excuse me?

01:48.909 --> 01:50.611
You came cross country.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.478
Why would you do that if you
don't think you can help?

01:52.513 --> 01:55.649
I've been asking myself
the same question.

01:55.949 --> 02:00.521
I guess...because
you sounded desperate.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.790
I-I realize that we don't
know each other very well.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.527
I don't even know
if you're any good.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.228
Are you?

02:08.794 --> 02:10.196
Yes.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.667
For whatever reason,

02:13.700 --> 02:15.702
I trust you.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.874
But could you just
look at the file,

02:20.907 --> 02:22.576
talk to my lawyer?

02:22.609 --> 02:24.845
I did not kill that woman.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.781
I never met that woman.
I am an innocent man.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.416
And if I lose the trial,

02:30.450 --> 02:33.386
I am looking
at the death penalty.

02:37.558 --> 02:40.794
(music playing)

03:26.607 --> 03:28.709
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.844
She flies halfway
across the world?

03:30.877 --> 03:32.779
She says she doesn't
even know him that good.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.315
They took an art class
together last year.
And on this...

03:35.348 --> 03:37.250
What can I say?
She felt compelled to go.

03:37.283 --> 03:39.385
I said the same things to her
that you're saying to me.

03:39.419 --> 03:40.754
Is she going
to try the case?

03:40.787 --> 03:42.355
She's just meeting
with his lawyer.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.323
She flies halfway --

03:43.356 --> 03:44.324
Jimmy.

03:44.357 --> 03:46.860
Hey, there's not like
an old boyfriend out there

03:46.893 --> 03:47.828
or something, is there?

03:49.395 --> 03:51.632
Look, I get paid
to ask the hard questions.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.399
She's just meeting
with his lawyer.

03:53.433 --> 03:54.367
When she gets back,

03:54.400 --> 03:57.403
you can all grill her
like you're grilling me.

03:58.438 --> 04:00.273
(sighs)

04:11.351 --> 04:12.819
Is he hiring you?

04:12.853 --> 04:15.321
I'm not looking to take over.
I'm just helping out a friend.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.858
Well, it's not good.

04:17.891 --> 04:20.694
They found the body
in the back of his car,

04:20.726 --> 04:23.664
the murder weapon buried
in some rags in his garage,

04:23.697 --> 04:25.599
evidence
of e-mail correspondence.

04:25.632 --> 04:27.067
He's claiming he was framed.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.168
Yeah, well,
all I can tell you is

04:28.201 --> 04:31.271
if he was framed, it was done
with meticulous detail.

04:32.005 --> 04:32.806
I should hire whoever

04:32.839 --> 04:34.975
did it to organize
things around here.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.743
You think he's guilty.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.545
I learned a long time ago

04:38.579 --> 04:40.981
to leave my personal opinions
out of the mix.

04:41.014 --> 04:44.017
I would say the evidence
leads me to believe he's guilty,

04:44.718 --> 04:45.886
but I do agree.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.521
It's difficult
to reconcile the facts

04:47.554 --> 04:48.755
with my sense of the man.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.058
Are these the files
on the case?

04:52.092 --> 04:54.561
No, that's
an antitrust matter.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.862
As boring as they come.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.532
Here's Dennis' file here.

05:02.603 --> 05:05.038
I'm actually on my way
into court this afternoon.

05:05.071 --> 05:07.574
I'm going to try
and buy a little more time.

05:09.075 --> 05:10.777
He really went to town
on her.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.481
She was pretty.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.317
Very.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.754
Who's this?

05:20.787 --> 05:22.355
That's Dennis' wife.

05:22.789 --> 05:24.324
What's her take?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.793
I don't know.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.530
Do I believe
he could murder somebody?

05:29.563 --> 05:32.365
No, but if you were
to ask me

05:32.398 --> 05:34.367
could I believe my husband
would have an affair,

05:34.400 --> 05:37.003
I would have said no
to that as well.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.339
I guess my take would be...

05:42.408 --> 05:45.612
I'm still in a state
of total confusion.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.048
Well, from what
I understand,

05:48.081 --> 05:51.585
your husband claims it was
just an e-mail affair.

05:51.618 --> 05:52.819
There was no physical...

05:52.853 --> 05:53.854
that's what
he told me, too,

05:53.887 --> 05:56.923
but they can prove he was
at her house, Ms. Dole.

05:57.558 --> 05:58.759
I beg your pardon?

05:58.792 --> 06:02.028
His prints were found
in the house.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.768
No, I was never there.
Never.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.069
Then how did
your fingerprints --

06:09.102 --> 06:10.504
I don't know!

06:11.505 --> 06:13.674
Don't scream at me,
Dennis.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.979
They found my fingerprints
on objects,

06:19.012 --> 06:21.114
things that can be moved.

06:21.147 --> 06:22.849
Her eyeglasses,
things personal to her,

06:22.883 --> 06:23.984
things you had to
have handled.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.086
Listen to me.
No, you listen.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.487
Don't be snapping at me

06:27.521 --> 06:29.422
like my questions are
some kind of betrayal.

06:29.455 --> 06:30.924
We don't really
know each other, Dennis.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.727
We took a class together.
We talked to each other

06:33.760 --> 06:35.896
2 nights a week
over a 3-month period.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.898
I don't really
know you at all,

06:39.132 --> 06:40.567
so I'll ask my questions,

06:40.601 --> 06:42.969
or I'll get right back
on that plane.

06:44.671 --> 06:48.208
I was never
in that woman's house.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.878
I did not kill her.

07:06.059 --> 07:09.062
Exactly why
did you call me?

07:10.597 --> 07:14.167
You said that your
greatest strength as a lawyer

07:14.200 --> 07:15.836
was that you can read people

07:15.869 --> 07:18.739
in depositions,
on witness chairs.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.173
You said that you could

07:20.206 --> 07:25.011
look into them and see
if they were truthful.

07:25.045 --> 07:28.014
Well, look into me,
Lindsay.

07:29.249 --> 07:32.753
Look, I know that my lawyer
doesn't believe me,

07:32.786 --> 07:35.522
and maybe even my wife
has doubts...

07:38.525 --> 07:39.793
look, I...

07:40.260 --> 07:44.464
I called you because
I need somebody who...

07:47.968 --> 07:51.471
look into me, Lindsay.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.025
I'm a little shocked,
actually.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.960
I really won't take up
much of your time.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.929
Less of it
than you'd hope, Ms. Dole.

08:16.563 --> 08:18.298
You really expect me
to cooperate with someone

08:18.331 --> 08:20.300
trying to help the man
who murdered my wife?

08:20.333 --> 08:23.203
I don't believe Dennis Mills
committed the crime.

08:24.204 --> 08:28.642
You don't. And so is this
an altruistic visit,

08:28.675 --> 08:30.176
or did he perhaps hire you?

08:30.210 --> 08:31.311
He hired me.
I won't lie, but --

08:31.344 --> 08:32.813
very nice
to have met you.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.815
Mr. Kingman --
Just for my own
education,

08:34.847 --> 08:37.183
how is it people like you
manage to sleep at night?

08:37.217 --> 08:39.219
If I --
You accept money
from murderers for

08:39.251 --> 08:42.722
the purpose of manufacturing
reasonable doubt.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.192
What happens
when you succeed?

08:46.226 --> 08:47.928
Do you then go out
and celebrate

08:47.961 --> 08:50.063
with your client,
encouraging him

08:50.096 --> 08:51.665
to recommend you
to his friends,

08:51.698 --> 08:53.667
so should they go out
and kill,

08:53.700 --> 08:56.837
you stand ready and able
with your services?

08:57.270 --> 08:59.239
You don't know me,
Mr. Kingman.

08:59.272 --> 09:03.209
You are soliciting
the widower of the victim.

09:04.010 --> 09:06.346
I know enough.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.549
Now please get out.

09:16.322 --> 09:18.725
Your honor, this is
just another delay.

09:18.759 --> 09:19.893
The people are prepared --

09:19.926 --> 09:22.128
Forgive me for not wanting to
rush through a capital case.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.797
Let me remind the court

09:23.830 --> 09:26.266
the people are seeking
a death penalty here.

09:26.299 --> 09:29.169
They might want to execute
my client on schedule,

09:29.202 --> 09:31.705
but before that, let's at least
pause to be thorough.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.974
I doubt it would insult
the process, your honor.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.309
Mr. Jacobs, step up here.

09:40.346 --> 09:42.949
You have come
into my courtroom six times

09:42.983 --> 09:45.619
for the exclusive purpose
of seeking a continuance,

09:45.652 --> 09:47.754
every motion brought
for the same reason --

09:47.788 --> 09:49.389
you not being ready.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.224
Not that there are
new developments,

09:51.257 --> 09:53.026
not that the witnesses
are unavailable,

09:53.059 --> 09:54.394
not that you're
in ailing health,

09:54.427 --> 09:56.196
only that you're not ready.

09:56.229 --> 09:59.299
The last time, what did
I tell you, Mr. Jacobs?

10:02.035 --> 10:03.003
If you don't remember,

10:03.036 --> 10:04.237
check the notice
from the court

10:04.270 --> 10:06.272
which memorialized
the proceeding.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.676
I ordered
no further continuances.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.945
Was I too subtle,
Mr. Jacobs?

10:11.978 --> 10:15.248
No, your honor, but given
the severity of the charges,

10:15.281 --> 10:16.416
I beg the court's
indulgence.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.051
Given the severity
of the charges,

10:18.084 --> 10:21.287
you should have walked in here
prepared, like you should have

10:21.321 --> 10:23.323
done the time before last
and the time before that.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.759
Your honor --
The court is through
with indulging you, counsel.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.061
Motion for continuance
denied.

10:28.094 --> 10:30.731
This trial begins
on Thursday.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.667
If you so much as look at me
with an expression

10:33.700 --> 10:35.301
that says "Gee, I wish I had
more time",

10:35.335 --> 10:38.338
I will hold you in contempt.
Got it?

10:39.339 --> 10:41.207
Yes, your honor.

10:47.714 --> 10:49.215
Six continuances?

10:49.249 --> 10:52.152
Look, you don't just show up
and wing a murder case.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.821
I understand, but not
to be critical, Mr. Jacobs,

10:54.855 --> 10:55.722
but from what I saw,

10:55.756 --> 10:57.423
the file doesn't look
terribly developed.

10:57.457 --> 11:01.294
Please. I just got my ass
chewed off by a rabid judge.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.029
I don't need it
nibbled on by you.

11:03.063 --> 11:03.930
I'm only asking whether --

11:03.964 --> 11:05.999
If you would like
to take this case over,

11:06.032 --> 11:06.900
be my guest.

11:06.933 --> 11:09.335
As you just heard,
I don't have much time,

11:09.369 --> 11:11.471
and I don't think it's
in Dennis Mills' best interest

11:11.505 --> 11:13.774
for you to be
slowing me down.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.244
May I ask
just one more question?

11:19.946 --> 11:22.716
Is your antitrust case
coming up for trial?

11:23.116 --> 11:25.118
(sighs)

11:28.522 --> 11:29.923
How long have you
known this guy?

11:29.956 --> 11:32.225
Forever. He's been
a friend of the family,

11:32.258 --> 11:34.728
and he has a reputation
for being a great litigator.

11:34.761 --> 11:37.063
Yes, well, he has
a multimillion-dollar

11:37.097 --> 11:39.465
software antitrust trial
slated for February,

11:39.499 --> 11:42.035
and something tells me that's
where all of his focus is.

11:42.068 --> 11:43.770
He's looking at your case
as simple --

11:43.804 --> 11:44.638
simple that you did it.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.807
That's why he's pushing
for murder two.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.242
In my opinion,
you need to switch attorneys.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.044
Well, can you do it?

11:52.345 --> 11:54.848
One week? There's no way
I could get up to speed,

11:54.881 --> 11:56.249
but I'm sure that
there are others that w--

11:56.282 --> 11:59.419
I want you.
There are plenty of criminal
defense attorneys out here --

11:59.452 --> 12:01.755
You believe I'm innocent.
I want you.

12:01.788 --> 12:02.956
You don't know
what I believe, so --

12:02.989 --> 12:05.325
I can read people, too,
Lindsay.

12:05.358 --> 12:08.061
You know I didn't do this.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.334
There is no way I can
be ready to do this

12:14.367 --> 12:15.969
in a week.

12:17.538 --> 12:19.205
I'm sorry.

12:20.440 --> 12:24.410
Well, couldn't you maybe
get somebody to help you?

12:35.188 --> 12:37.123
LUCY: I have so wanted
to go to California.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.792
Yes, Lucy,
you've been saying that

12:38.825 --> 12:39.860
for the last five hours.

12:39.893 --> 12:40.927
This isn't
a vacation.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.428
Can this guy
afford all of us?

12:42.462 --> 12:44.430
Not that it's my worry.
I'm not a partner.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.233
You are my hero. I've always
wanted to come here.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.302
BOBBY: Lucy...
I've got three
adjoining rooms.

12:49.335 --> 12:51.271
I've already turned it into
kind of a command center.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.472
Oh, this is nuts.
I know.

12:52.506 --> 12:54.908
Wait. Three rooms?
Where do I sleep?

12:54.941 --> 12:56.476
Well, I guess she figured
you'd meet somebody.

12:56.510 --> 12:58.845
Funny.
Come on.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.383
She was hit
a total of 6 times.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.519
The fatal blow being the one
on the temporal lobe.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.121
(slide changes)

13:08.154 --> 13:10.323
That's how she used to look.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.958
(slide changes)

13:12.559 --> 13:14.227
Victim's sister.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.862
There's always a nun.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.197
Lucy.
Quiet.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.332
How is she relevant?
She isn't, really,

13:19.365 --> 13:21.134
except to swear
that there's no way her sister

13:21.167 --> 13:22.936
would ever hook up
with anybody she met online,

13:22.969 --> 13:24.605
and that's potentially
exculpatory.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.272
How'd they find the body?

13:26.306 --> 13:28.374
Dennis' wife discovered it
and called the police.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.877
So we can forget
any motion to suppress.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.413
There's our judge.

13:33.446 --> 13:34.347
Pete Wilson appointee.

13:34.380 --> 13:35.215
Very right wing.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.583
Do not expect him
to like any lawyer

13:36.617 --> 13:37.551
coming in from out of state.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.954
Also, do not do not do not
interrupt him.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.523
Supposedly he's got
a major peeve on that.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.559
That's Dennis.

13:45.592 --> 13:46.993
Guilty.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.328
Lucy.
Quiet.

13:49.062 --> 13:51.497
He says he never
even met the victim.

13:51.532 --> 13:53.499
But he doesn't deny
e-mailing her?

13:53.534 --> 13:55.268
My theory is
somebody else online

13:55.301 --> 13:57.337
intercepted the correspondence,
stole Dennis' I. D.,

13:57.370 --> 13:58.471
then planned the meet.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.007
After the murder,
he sticks the body
in Dennis' trunk,

14:01.041 --> 14:03.043
knowing that the Internet trail
would lead to Dennis.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.378
How do you explain
Dennis' prints at the scene?

14:05.411 --> 14:07.548
(sighs) I can't yet.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.984
Okay, first thing, we got
to try for a continuance.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.186
That'll be tough.
New counsel.
I should get it.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.621
Meanwhile, let's talk
to the victim's sister,

14:14.655 --> 14:16.189
the nun.
Ellenor, go see her.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.659
Lucy, we got to find out
who else the woman e-mailed.

14:18.692 --> 14:21.027
I should meet
with the client.

14:21.327 --> 14:23.530
Henry Doaks.
Lead homicide detective.

14:23.564 --> 14:25.165
Veteran. Good cop. Drinker.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.633
Jimmy, try to talk to him.
We should also see

14:26.667 --> 14:29.135
if there's any dirt --
gambling problem,

14:29.169 --> 14:30.937
maybe a little hooker habit
on the side, whatever --

14:30.971 --> 14:32.438
anything I can use.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.406
What do we have
for our case?

14:33.439 --> 14:36.276
Just Dennis. Home alone
at the time of death.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.410
Where was his wife?

14:37.443 --> 14:39.112
Giving a seminar
in Mar Vista.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.915
She's a teacher.
Is she with us on this?

14:41.948 --> 14:44.585
Yes, but the affair
left her a little shaky.

14:44.618 --> 14:47.187
Okay, talk to her again.
Make sure we can count on her.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.221
Any character witnesses?

14:48.254 --> 14:49.389
I'm running that down.

14:50.624 --> 14:52.192
Okay, I guess we all
have jobs to do.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.326
Can I talk to you
for a sec?

14:53.359 --> 14:55.261
Mm-hmm.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.664
how well do you know
this guy?

14:57.698 --> 14:58.765
I told you -- art class.

14:58.799 --> 15:02.168
What'd you paint -- nudes?
Were you the model or what?

15:02.202 --> 15:04.505
What?
What's he have on you?

15:04.538 --> 15:06.039
What do you mean
what's he have on me?

15:06.072 --> 15:08.274
We flew four lawyers plus
an assistant cross-country

15:08.308 --> 15:09.976
based on your conviction
that the wrong guy

15:10.010 --> 15:11.612
is being railroaded
for murder?

15:11.645 --> 15:13.647
That's right.
Where's your evidence?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.582
You say yourself
you don't know him that well.

15:15.616 --> 15:18.218
What's making you so sure
he's not a murderer?

15:18.251 --> 15:19.185
What am I missing?

15:19.219 --> 15:21.722
Sometimes when you
meet people, you get a feel.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.223
A feel?

15:23.256 --> 15:24.525
Yes, a feel.

15:24.558 --> 15:26.326
I mean, maybe I can't
explain how I know,

15:26.359 --> 15:28.128
but I just do.

15:29.295 --> 15:31.497
Bobby, sometimes you just
know things about people.

15:31.532 --> 15:34.668
Dennis Mills is not capable
of killing anybody.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.337
We've got an innocent man.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.711
(church bell rings)

15:48.014 --> 15:50.383
It is absolutely impossible.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.418
I have told the police this.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.722
Stacey would never, never
meet up with a person

15:55.756 --> 15:57.323
she met in some
Internet chat room.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.526
Sister, she did write
those e-mails.

15:59.560 --> 16:03.329
Yes, she had a wild side
on the Internet.

16:03.363 --> 16:06.466
I realize this,
but there is a big difference

16:06.499 --> 16:08.468
between writing
anonymous correspondence

16:08.502 --> 16:11.505
and meeting up
with a stranger in person.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.775
My sister was not that big
of a risk taker.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.643
Which leads you
to believe...

16:17.544 --> 16:20.213
she was killed
by a stranger

16:20.246 --> 16:22.282
or she was introduced
to this Mr. Mills

16:22.315 --> 16:23.449
in some other fashion.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.318
Would you testify to that?

16:27.187 --> 16:28.522
I suppose.

16:28.555 --> 16:29.489
You really don't think,

16:29.523 --> 16:31.224
after a long correspondence,

16:31.257 --> 16:33.059
she would agree
to meet in person?

16:35.261 --> 16:36.196
If she did,

16:36.229 --> 16:39.132
well, maybe she deserves
to burn in hell, then,

16:39.733 --> 16:42.435
in eternal flame.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.479
(softly)
Well, that's a lovely thought.

17:05.090 --> 17:07.460
I don't deny
writing the e-mails.

17:07.492 --> 17:08.595
What's the issue?

17:08.628 --> 17:12.298
The issue is this isn't just
evidence of correspondence.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.835
This is dark. It's sexual.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.803
(sighs)

17:16.837 --> 17:19.372
You get online,
and you can assume

17:19.405 --> 17:22.442
a different personality,
a different persona.

17:22.474 --> 17:25.846
It's like playacting,
but I'm not that person.

17:25.878 --> 17:26.813
That was just a game.

17:26.847 --> 17:29.249
I have never, ever
hurt anybody.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.552
And you never
even met her?
No.

17:40.761 --> 17:42.529
All right, I want you
to listen to me

17:42.563 --> 17:44.831
very carefully.

17:44.865 --> 17:46.466
Can you do that, Dennis?

17:46.499 --> 17:48.401
Please don't talk to me
like I'm an idiot.

17:48.434 --> 17:49.402
I'm not an idiot.

17:49.435 --> 17:51.505
Maybe not, but if you're
innocent, then someone's

17:51.538 --> 17:53.874
playing you very successfully
for a fool.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.743
I don't like him.
I don't want him to be --
You asked me to help you.

17:56.777 --> 17:58.111
I brought him in from Boston.

17:58.144 --> 18:01.247
I don't care!
Fine.
Then we'll all leave.

18:04.150 --> 18:07.120
I brought him in because
he is your best last chance.

18:07.153 --> 18:09.856
You are looking
at the death penalty.
You said it yourself.

18:09.890 --> 18:11.124
If he can help you,

18:11.157 --> 18:12.526
I'd put up
with what he has to say,

18:12.559 --> 18:15.328
even if he makes you feel
like an idiot.

18:28.809 --> 18:30.210
Go ahead.

18:30.811 --> 18:32.646
For us to have any chance,

18:32.679 --> 18:34.715
you will need
to take the stand.

18:34.748 --> 18:36.517
For me to be able
to put you on the stand,

18:36.550 --> 18:40.621
I have to believe that you
will give truthful testimony.

18:40.654 --> 18:43.223
So if I did kill her,
keep it to myself,

18:43.256 --> 18:44.257
is that what you're saying?

18:45.759 --> 18:47.694
On everything else,
I have to know.

18:47.728 --> 18:51.331
I cannot be surprised.
Do you hear me, Dennis?

18:51.364 --> 18:53.834
That means if you did
ever meet her,

18:53.867 --> 18:55.502
if you did have an affair,

18:55.536 --> 18:57.470
if you did ever go
to her house,

18:57.504 --> 19:00.240
I need to know.

19:00.273 --> 19:03.610
Were you having a relationship
with that woman?

19:12.786 --> 19:15.722
This was the relationship.

19:15.756 --> 19:19.826
I have never, ever met her
in person.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.938
All I'm saying is he's got
some serious rage going on.

19:31.972 --> 19:34.474
If somebody framed you
for murder, you'd be upset.

19:34.508 --> 19:37.243
I'm telling you it's the sister.
That "burn in hell" crack?

19:37.277 --> 19:39.445
Oh, come on, Ellenor.
That's a George Vogelman thing.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.582
A what?
You look at nuns now
and see killers.

19:41.615 --> 19:44.284
You're a nun bigot.
That doesn't make any sense.
All right, don't start.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.719
You're the one
who got attacked, not me.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.788
But I don't look at anybody
in a habit and go, "murderer."

19:47.821 --> 19:49.823
I don't do that.
All right.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.257
I'm telling you,
the sister was weird, okay?

19:51.291 --> 19:53.293
I was there, you weren't.
I said, "All right."

19:54.795 --> 19:56.396
Did she say anything
to help us?

19:56.429 --> 19:57.998
As a matter of fact, yes.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.332
She said she didn't think
Stacey would meet up

19:59.365 --> 20:01.334
with somebody who she met
in a chat room.

20:02.002 --> 20:05.238
That it?
Well, it's something.
What'd you get?

20:05.271 --> 20:07.407
I'm not criticizing,
I'm just analyzing...

20:07.440 --> 20:08.809
No, I mean, you just said,
"Is that it?" Like I failed.

20:08.842 --> 20:10.611
All right.
Oh, and now you're
going, "All right."

20:10.644 --> 20:11.778
All right.

20:14.681 --> 20:15.882
New evidence?

20:15.916 --> 20:17.784
What do you mean
new evidence?

20:17.818 --> 20:19.653
Anything you didn't
already give the D. A.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.654
I don't care.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.657
Look, I'm just trying
to justify a fee.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.358
If I can go back
to my client with anything,

20:25.391 --> 20:26.693
it'll make it easier
to collect.

20:26.727 --> 20:27.961
You get what I'm saying.

20:27.994 --> 20:30.764
Any other suspect
you ran down.

20:30.797 --> 20:33.033
If I dig up a red herring,
even a bogus one,

20:33.066 --> 20:34.835
I'll get to bank
my retainer.

20:35.769 --> 20:37.437
What do I look like,
some rookie?

20:37.804 --> 20:39.840
Trying to justify a fee?

20:39.873 --> 20:41.542
You're in here trying
to glean anything you can

20:41.575 --> 20:44.310
to put that bastard back
on the streets.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.713
I'm not going to give you
anything, Mr. Berluti,

20:46.747 --> 20:47.548
and I don't give a rat's ass

20:47.581 --> 20:49.382
whether you get
to bank your retainer.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.051
We don't have to get
aggressive here.

20:51.084 --> 20:54.054
Oh, right, we're buddies.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.757
I don't like your little
camaraderie come-on.

20:56.790 --> 20:59.492
I'm a police officer.
You're a defense lawyer.

20:59.526 --> 21:00.894
We don't lump in well.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.597
What, you want to make it
like a big fight?

21:03.630 --> 21:04.531
Yeah, counsel.

21:04.565 --> 21:06.800
You're in the business
of freeing murderers.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.636
I'd be happy to make it
into a big fight.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.911
And pursuant
to my client's right
to a fair trial,

21:17.944 --> 21:19.813
the interests of justice
certainly demand

21:19.846 --> 21:21.515
that his new lawyers
be afforded time

21:21.548 --> 21:24.585
to properly get up to speed
and prepare for trial.

21:24.618 --> 21:26.319
We wouldn't be looking
for a big delay, your honor.

21:26.352 --> 21:28.622
I think we could be ready
in three weeks even.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.557
Three weeks?
Yes.

21:31.357 --> 21:32.392
Mr. Donnell,
I don't know how

21:32.425 --> 21:33.960
you do things
in Massachusetts.

21:33.994 --> 21:35.361
In Massachusetts,

21:35.395 --> 21:36.563
the courts
may not have a problem

21:36.597 --> 21:38.832
continuing a case
in perpetuity,

21:38.865 --> 21:41.568
but we're a little different
in California, counsel,

21:41.602 --> 21:42.603
and when a case is already --

21:42.636 --> 21:44.304
Your honor, I...

21:49.510 --> 21:52.345
In Massachusetts,
maybe a defendant,

21:52.378 --> 21:53.714
if he wants
to keep delaying trial,

21:53.747 --> 21:54.748
he can just fire counsel

21:54.781 --> 21:56.817
and have his new new lawyers
beg the judge

21:56.850 --> 21:58.719
for time to get up to speed.

21:59.452 --> 22:02.589
But it was a long flight,
wasn't it, Mr. Donnell?

22:03.757 --> 22:05.458
I just asked you a question,
Mr. Donnell.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.093
Was it not
a very long flight?

22:08.028 --> 22:10.363
Yes, your honor, it was.

22:10.396 --> 22:12.733
Yes, and when you
got off that plane,

22:12.766 --> 22:14.467
you might perhaps
have looked around,

22:14.500 --> 22:15.736
saw a palm tree or two,

22:15.769 --> 22:17.938
the Pacific Ocean,
freeway gridlock.

22:17.971 --> 22:18.739
You should have known
right then

22:18.772 --> 22:21.875
you were no longer
in Massachusetts.

22:23.143 --> 22:25.478
This case is set for trial
on Thursday.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.013
I will be here,
Mr. Fox will be here,

22:27.047 --> 22:28.682
your client, Mr. Mills,
will be here,

22:28.715 --> 22:29.783
and we will begin.

22:29.816 --> 22:31.952
Either you can join us,

22:31.985 --> 22:34.921
or you can go back
to Massachusetts.

22:34.955 --> 22:35.922
Adjourned.

22:35.956 --> 22:37.691
(bangs gavel)

22:40.961 --> 22:43.363
Hold on.
Hold on just a second.

22:44.765 --> 22:45.666
Uh-oh.

22:49.002 --> 22:49.970
Come on, Bobby.

22:50.003 --> 22:52.739
Are we not done, counsel?

22:56.743 --> 22:58.044
Yes, your honor...

22:59.112 --> 23:00.480
done.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.121
What the hell was that?

23:08.154 --> 23:09.723
We're in L. A.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.793
Hey, your instincts
on the nun might be right.

23:12.826 --> 23:14.494
She has an assault
and drug record.

23:14.528 --> 23:15.662
You've got to be kidding.

23:15.696 --> 23:16.863
As a teenager.

23:18.198 --> 23:19.432
It's something.

23:19.465 --> 23:21.434
Yes, it is.

23:25.205 --> 23:26.607
Why'd you move out here?

23:26.640 --> 23:28.074
People frame people
for murders,

23:28.108 --> 23:29.676
then they get judges
like this.

23:29.710 --> 23:31.612
It's a horrible,
horrible state.

23:31.645 --> 23:33.614
My wife couldn't take
the winters back East.

23:34.681 --> 23:36.583
Speaking of which,

23:37.117 --> 23:38.552
is she going
to support you here?

23:38.585 --> 23:39.986
Yes. Why?

23:40.854 --> 23:41.822
Well, she describes herself

23:41.855 --> 23:44.791
as being in a state
of confusion over all this,

23:44.825 --> 23:47.594
and that's not exactly
a ringing endorsement.

23:47.628 --> 23:49.996
Karen knows I didn't do this.
She'll say that.

23:50.030 --> 23:52.999
Well, we don't have much time
for her to get clearheaded.

23:53.033 --> 23:55.001
I'm off to meet with her now.

23:55.035 --> 23:56.903
Bobby, Jimmy, and Ellenor
are running down

23:56.937 --> 23:59.139
everybody else they can locate
who was in that chat room.

23:59.706 --> 24:01.474
I think my other lawyer already
did that.

24:01.508 --> 24:02.909
I think he didn't.

24:04.711 --> 24:09.550
Listen, if we could get it
to voluntary manslaughter --

24:10.083 --> 24:11.952
that's not an indication
that I think you're guilty.

24:11.985 --> 24:12.886
Then what is it?

24:12.919 --> 24:15.722
As assessment of our case.

24:15.756 --> 24:17.591
With the realization
in defeat,

24:17.624 --> 24:20.026
we are looking
at a lethal injection.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.770
If I am put to death,
then I am put to death,

24:29.803 --> 24:31.838
but I certainly will not say
that I committed a murder

24:31.872 --> 24:32.806
when I didn't.

24:33.607 --> 24:35.742
My kids may not get
to grow up

24:35.776 --> 24:36.977
with their father, Lindsay,

24:37.010 --> 24:37.911
but they will get
to grow up

24:37.944 --> 24:40.747
with at least the chance
of believing in him.

24:42.182 --> 24:44.585
I won't take that away
from them.

24:52.626 --> 24:53.927
We gotta get out of this.

24:53.960 --> 24:54.928
I promised him.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.062
You tried to help,
I know,

24:56.096 --> 24:57.731
and the best way
we can help

24:57.764 --> 24:59.165
is to drop him.

24:59.199 --> 25:01.234
With no lawyer, this thing
can't start on Thursday.

25:01.267 --> 25:02.703
The judge won't go for that.

25:02.736 --> 25:03.770
What's he going to do,

25:03.804 --> 25:05.572
force the guy to stand trial
without representation?

25:05.606 --> 25:06.907
Well, this judge just might.

25:06.940 --> 25:08.742
In which case,
he'd guarantee a new trial.

25:08.775 --> 25:09.743
We came out here --

25:09.776 --> 25:11.311
I know you want
to help him,

25:11.344 --> 25:12.979
but we have to face it.

25:13.013 --> 25:15.816
We've got nothing
to mount a defense with.

25:16.149 --> 25:18.118
Add to that this judge
isn't going to cut any favors

25:18.151 --> 25:20.286
for out-of-state lawyers,
the best thing we can do

25:20.320 --> 25:22.589
is to get back on that plane.

25:22.623 --> 25:23.423
We're fighters.

25:23.456 --> 25:24.958
We don't give up like this.
We fight.

25:24.991 --> 25:29.896
Yes, we do,
but this is Dennis' fight.

25:31.197 --> 25:34.601
He's got a better chance
with somebody else.

25:35.736 --> 25:37.070
Is this about money?

25:38.905 --> 25:41.041
You know it isn't.

25:51.384 --> 25:53.086
Anybody disagree?

25:58.391 --> 25:59.359
Then let's pack up,

25:59.392 --> 26:01.795
we'll bring a motion
to withdraw in the morning,

26:01.828 --> 26:04.264
and then go home.

26:17.711 --> 26:18.845
Who do you think
you're kidding?

26:18.879 --> 26:20.681
On what basis
do you seek to withdraw?

26:20.714 --> 26:23.116
Your honor, before a trial,
I'm not sure we need grounds.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.952
Four days before you do.
I'm waiting.

26:25.986 --> 26:28.254
We have fundamental differences
with the defendant.

26:28.288 --> 26:29.890
What differences?

26:29.923 --> 26:32.893
That remains
within work product.

26:32.926 --> 26:34.360
You will stay on
as counsel.

26:34.394 --> 26:36.296
You can't force us
to remain here.

26:36.329 --> 26:37.898
I can absolutely force you,
Mr. Donnell,

26:37.931 --> 26:38.665
and that's what I'm doing.

26:38.699 --> 26:40.200
This is another
dilatory attempt,

26:40.233 --> 26:41.635
and my patience
is wearing thin.

26:41.668 --> 26:43.236
I'm not seeking
a continuance.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.772
Mr. Mills can get
another attorney.

26:45.806 --> 26:47.107
The effect of which
would compel me

26:47.140 --> 26:49.876
to postpone trial.
You have an offer

26:49.910 --> 26:51.845
of second degree
on the table, Mr. Donnell.

26:51.878 --> 26:54.915
The court suggests you give
serious regard to it.

26:54.948 --> 26:57.884
Is the court trying
to coerce a plea?

26:57.918 --> 26:59.419
The court is trying
to convey to counsel

26:59.452 --> 27:01.855
it will not be manipulated
by tactics.

27:01.888 --> 27:03.790
I'm not doing that.

27:05.025 --> 27:08.294
I've familiarized myself
with you.

27:08.328 --> 27:09.062
Do you know
what your brethren

27:09.095 --> 27:11.397
think about you
in Massachusetts?

27:11.431 --> 27:13.333
They say if you were
to go out to feed the pigs,

27:13.366 --> 27:15.335
you'd have to get
somebody else to call them.

27:16.136 --> 27:18.004
I don't believe
you're withdrawing

27:18.038 --> 27:20.206
for any other reason
than to buy time,

27:20.240 --> 27:22.743
which you may believe
is in your client's interest.

27:22.776 --> 27:25.178
Motion to withdraw
as counsel denied.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.780
Now go about your work.

27:39.860 --> 27:40.827
It was a chat room.

27:40.861 --> 27:43.096
I never met anybody from it
in person, I swear.

27:43.129 --> 27:45.165
Did you ever correspond
with Mrs. Kingman?

27:45.198 --> 27:47.100
Mr. Donnell, what's going
on here? I swear --

27:47.133 --> 27:48.702
I'm just trying
to get a sense --

27:48.735 --> 27:50.971
Look, if it ever gets out
that I was in that chat room,

27:51.004 --> 27:53.239
my job could be in jeopardy.

27:53.273 --> 27:57.043
It was one of those
erotic things.

27:57.077 --> 27:57.844
I understand.

27:57.878 --> 27:59.946
I swear I never met
a single person.

27:59.980 --> 28:01.347
Everybody used Pseudonyms.

28:01.381 --> 28:04.084
Mr. Letterman,
take a breath.

28:04.117 --> 28:06.219
And the police
never talked to you?

28:06.252 --> 28:09.055
No. Why should they?

28:09.089 --> 28:10.891
Can you tell me
where you were

28:10.924 --> 28:12.726
on the night of May 12th?

28:14.294 --> 28:15.896
Oh, my God.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.298
You're talking to me
like I'm a suspect.

28:19.432 --> 28:20.266
Oh, my God.

28:20.300 --> 28:21.267
Mr. Letterman --

28:21.301 --> 28:23.203
my life is over.

28:23.236 --> 28:25.238
Mr. Letterman,
your life isn't over.

28:25.271 --> 28:27.307
Oh, my God.

28:27.340 --> 28:29.242
Oh, my God.

28:33.246 --> 28:35.015
I understand
you have reservations,

28:35.048 --> 28:36.817
but, Mrs. Mills,

28:36.850 --> 28:38.184
do you think
your husband is capable

28:38.218 --> 28:39.419
of committing this crime?

28:42.455 --> 28:43.724
No.

28:44.157 --> 28:45.892
Well, if I ask you that
on the stand,

28:45.926 --> 28:47.427
you can't take that beat
before answering.

28:47.460 --> 28:49.395
You need to respond quickly
and emphatically,

28:49.429 --> 28:50.864
otherwise I can't
even put you up there.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.866
But won't they ask me
about his affair?

28:52.899 --> 28:54.334
He claims there was none.

28:54.367 --> 28:55.501
You don't believe him
on that?

28:55.536 --> 28:57.771
Not necessarily, no.

28:57.804 --> 29:00.473
Look, you read those letters.
What do you think?

29:00.507 --> 29:02.408
I haven't known him
for 15 years.

29:02.442 --> 29:03.276
Oh, I suddenly wonder

29:03.309 --> 29:05.779
maybe I haven't really
known him, either.

29:05.812 --> 29:08.048
Those kinds of answers,
we don't call you.

29:08.081 --> 29:10.383
Oh, look, please do not
tell me what to say.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.318
I'm not telling you
what to say.

29:12.352 --> 29:14.888
I just need to know
what you will say.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.523
I feel like
I'm being pressured.

29:16.557 --> 29:18.825
I'm the one under pressure,
Mrs. Mills.

29:18.859 --> 29:20.026
We just got this case.

29:20.060 --> 29:22.028
We have to be prepared
to try in three days.

29:22.062 --> 29:24.330
We are under
enormous pressure,

29:24.364 --> 29:25.165
and if you don't
take that stand

29:25.198 --> 29:27.300
and categorically deny
the possibility

29:27.333 --> 29:29.002
that your husband
could have done this,

29:29.035 --> 29:31.104
then you're no good to him.

29:32.038 --> 29:34.040
Can you say that or not?

29:37.243 --> 29:38.411
How dare you?

29:38.444 --> 29:40.313
It's just
a simple question, ma'am.

29:40.346 --> 29:41.314
A simple question --

29:41.347 --> 29:43.183
where was I on the night
my sister was murdered?

29:43.216 --> 29:44.918
Well, here's
a simple response --

29:44.951 --> 29:46.019
Go to hell!

29:46.052 --> 29:47.420
Nice talk for a nun.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.289
One of the reasons
I joined the convent

29:49.322 --> 29:51.558
was because I was
a troubled teenager, yes.

29:51.592 --> 29:54.027
If that makes me a murder
suspect in your mind --

29:54.060 --> 29:55.295
I didn't accuse you
of murder.

29:55.328 --> 29:56.963
Why were you asking
my whereabouts?

29:56.997 --> 29:59.332
I'm just collecting
information. That's all.

29:59.365 --> 30:00.601
Well, you're not
very good at it.

30:00.634 --> 30:02.503
I'm done talking to you.

30:21.421 --> 30:23.289
I feel like Mannix.

30:23.323 --> 30:24.157
Who?

30:24.190 --> 30:25.325
Mannix.

30:25.358 --> 30:27.127
Didn't you ever watch that?

30:27.160 --> 30:28.929
He was a private eye.

30:28.962 --> 30:31.164
I had this crush on Peggy.

30:33.534 --> 30:35.135
(doorbell rings)

30:35.168 --> 30:37.437
Came on before
"Mission: Impossible."

30:37.470 --> 30:40.240
You probably liked
"Man from U. N. C. L. E."

30:42.075 --> 30:42.943
I didn't order nobody.

30:42.976 --> 30:44.645
We just want to talk
to you, Mr. Brickman.

30:44.678 --> 30:45.979
No.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.614
I have a gun.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.452
That was a Mannix move.

30:57.090 --> 30:58.191
Nice place.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.292
What do you guys want?

30:59.325 --> 31:00.627
I didn't do nothing.

31:00.661 --> 31:02.395
We came to talk to you
about Stacey Kingman.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.531
I didn't kill her.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.669
That's kind of
a funny response.

31:08.702 --> 31:10.504
We didn't ask you
if you killed her.

31:10.537 --> 31:13.173
The police did.
I told them.

31:13.206 --> 31:15.275
The police talked to you?

31:15.308 --> 31:17.010
Yeah.
Why?

31:17.043 --> 31:18.579
Because of the e-mail crap,

31:18.612 --> 31:21.682
but it's just letters,
you know?

31:21.715 --> 31:23.216
I told them
I just send this stuff.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.586
It means nothing.
It's a hobby.

31:25.619 --> 31:27.120
What do you write
in your e-mails?

31:27.153 --> 31:29.890
That I was going
to kill her and stuff,

31:30.456 --> 31:33.193
but, I mean, I write that
to lots of girls.

31:33.226 --> 31:35.461
That you're going
to kill them?

31:35.495 --> 31:36.162
Yeah.

31:36.196 --> 31:39.299
But they're all living,
happy.

31:39.332 --> 31:41.234
I'm friends with some.

31:43.704 --> 31:45.572
There's nothing
about this man in the file,

31:45.606 --> 31:47.107
absolutely nothing.

31:47.140 --> 31:48.374
We didn't know about him.

31:48.408 --> 31:49.309
The police
interviewed the guy.

31:49.342 --> 31:50.511
Well, they never brought him
to the attention

31:50.544 --> 31:51.978
of the district
attorney's office.

31:52.012 --> 31:53.079
I'm sure you never
heard of him.

31:53.113 --> 31:54.080
I don't like
your accusation.

31:54.114 --> 31:55.181
Your honor,
this is obviously new

31:55.215 --> 31:58.084
and exculpatory evidence.
We need time to explore it.

31:58.118 --> 31:59.019
Denied.

31:59.052 --> 32:00.253
The man e-mailed the victim

32:00.286 --> 32:01.354
threatening to kill her.

32:01.387 --> 32:04.057
And as I understand it,
he e-mailed hundreds of women.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.192
But this woman
ended up dead.

32:06.226 --> 32:08.294
Look, I see an army of lawyers
at your table.

32:08.328 --> 32:09.362
You can chase
all this down --

32:09.395 --> 32:10.463
That's crazy!

32:15.135 --> 32:18.204
Your honor,
we need more time.

32:18.238 --> 32:20.473
There's been
no unfair surprise here.

32:20.507 --> 32:22.242
The trial doesn't begin
until Thursday.

32:22.275 --> 32:23.476
To me, that's enough time.

32:23.510 --> 32:26.112
Motion
for a continuance denied.

32:26.146 --> 32:28.949
We'll start voir dire
after lunch.

32:34.788 --> 32:35.656
Bobby.

32:37.791 --> 32:39.092
Does counsel
have a thought

32:39.125 --> 32:41.194
he'd like to share
with the court?

32:43.630 --> 32:46.099
Is this typical
of a California judge?

32:46.132 --> 32:47.133
Let's look
at the bright side --

32:47.167 --> 32:48.635
at least
we got something now.

32:48.669 --> 32:49.435
What did you find?

32:49.469 --> 32:51.204
A guy who threatened
to kill her.

32:51.237 --> 32:52.072
Excuse me?

32:52.105 --> 32:54.007
Mr. Kingman, hello.

32:54.675 --> 32:56.543
He shut me down.
You talked to him?

32:56.577 --> 32:57.744
Ellenor.

33:00.380 --> 33:02.282
Mr. Kingman, my name
is Ellenor Frutt.

33:02.315 --> 33:04.484
I'm one of the attorneys
representing Dennis Mills.

33:04.518 --> 33:06.319
Yes. You flew in
from Boston.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.188
Mr. Kingman,
did you know your wife

33:08.221 --> 33:10.123
was corresponding
with Anthony Brickman?

33:11.525 --> 33:14.160
Did you know the content
of the e-mail?

33:14.761 --> 33:15.696
No.

33:15.729 --> 33:17.230
Could it be possible --

33:17.263 --> 33:19.032
what's going on here?

33:19.065 --> 33:21.301
We're just discussing
the lovely California weather.

33:21.334 --> 33:22.736
What's it to you?

33:22.769 --> 33:25.371
I don't want you harassing
government witnesses.

33:25.405 --> 33:26.573
Mr. Kingman, please.

33:26.607 --> 33:28.675
Hold on, are you instructing
this witness not to speak to me?

33:28.709 --> 33:29.610
What's going on?

33:29.643 --> 33:31.444
He's instructing witnesses
not to cooperate.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.413
I am shielding a witness
from harassment.

33:33.446 --> 33:35.782
You have no idea
what I was saying to him.

33:35.816 --> 33:37.684
I know you weren't discussing
the weather, counsel.

33:37.718 --> 33:40.420
You can't tell a witness
not to talk to us, Mr. Fox.

33:40.453 --> 33:41.254
I can tell a witness

33:41.287 --> 33:43.590
to speak at his own peril,
Mr. Donnell.

33:43.624 --> 33:45.425
You think I didn't
check you people out?

33:46.092 --> 33:48.228
Plan "b" --
think that secret

33:48.261 --> 33:49.596
was going to stay back
in Boston?

33:49.630 --> 33:51.331
I know all about
the disgusting strategies

33:51.364 --> 33:52.465
you people employ.

33:52.498 --> 33:54.701
Hey.
You're the one
concealing evidence.

33:54.735 --> 33:56.202
I didn't know
about that man.

33:56.236 --> 33:57.604
Yeah, right.

33:59.272 --> 34:01.708
Mr. Donnell, let me
give you a piece of advice

34:01.742 --> 34:03.710
from a co-member
of the bar.

34:04.344 --> 34:05.779
You pull the crap
in this court

34:05.812 --> 34:07.614
that you regularly pull
in Boston,

34:07.648 --> 34:09.683
and you will be doing
more time than Mr. Mills.

34:09.716 --> 34:11.717
Let me give you a tip --

34:11.752 --> 34:14.721
neither you nor that fat-ass
orange county alumnus

34:14.755 --> 34:16.556
wearing the robe scare me.

34:16.590 --> 34:18.625
LINDSAY: Okay, Bobby.
ELLENOR: Don't even bother.

34:19.259 --> 34:21.194
It's not worth it.

34:22.795 --> 34:24.731
All right, Lindsay, Ellenor,
you take voir dire.

34:24.764 --> 34:27.367
Jimmy, you and I should go back
to see Brickman.

34:28.268 --> 34:29.735
I love L. A.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.447
Suspended twice,

34:41.481 --> 34:44.685
once in 1992
and again in '96.

34:44.717 --> 34:45.451
Both were drinking?

34:45.485 --> 34:47.453
Who are you
talking about?
Yeah.

34:47.487 --> 34:49.822
Doaks, the detective in charge
of the investigation.

34:49.856 --> 34:51.491
You smell anything on his
breath when you met him?

34:51.525 --> 34:52.759
Just venom.

34:52.793 --> 34:55.128
Divorced in '95 --

34:55.161 --> 34:56.563
probably related
to his drinking.

34:56.597 --> 34:58.699
Jimmy, ask a few questions
down at the courthouse.

34:58.732 --> 35:00.466
The clerks know everything.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.536
Oh, I'm sure
they'll cooperate.

35:02.569 --> 35:04.304
Everyone out here
is so helpful.

35:04.337 --> 35:05.271
Just ask around.

35:05.305 --> 35:07.608
Lead detective --
anything we can get on him.

35:07.641 --> 35:09.676
Lucy, why are you wearing
a bathing suit?

35:09.710 --> 35:12.579
Oh, I was going to catch
a little pool time.

35:12.613 --> 35:13.614
Forget it.

35:14.681 --> 35:16.282
Bobby, I did not come
to California

35:16.316 --> 35:17.217
to be cooped up
in this room.

35:17.250 --> 35:18.384
Lucy, I told you

35:18.418 --> 35:19.352
this is not a vacation.
I've indexed all the witnesses,

35:19.385 --> 35:20.253
we're going to trial.
The exhibits are ready.

35:20.286 --> 35:21.254
We're not out here for you
and if I'm done,

35:21.287 --> 35:22.856
I'm here to work on my tan.
To work on your tan.

35:24.290 --> 35:25.692
Keep checking
on the detective

35:25.726 --> 35:27.127
and the nun.

35:31.765 --> 35:34.535
Have you read about this case
at all, Mrs. Reynolds?

35:34.568 --> 35:37.671
Maybe a little, not much.

35:37.704 --> 35:39.740
Can you tell me
what you know about it?

35:39.773 --> 35:41.374
Just that this Mills fellow

35:41.407 --> 35:43.409
is accused
of killing the woman.

35:43.443 --> 35:44.911
Do you think
you can be impartial?

35:44.945 --> 35:47.180
All things considered?

35:47.213 --> 35:49.282
What do you mean, "All things
considered"?

35:49.315 --> 35:51.952
Well, when a man
bludgeons somebody to death

35:51.985 --> 35:53.954
and sticks her
in a car trunk,

35:53.987 --> 35:55.556
all things considered,

35:55.589 --> 35:58.792
I can be as neutral
as the next person.

36:01.494 --> 36:02.763
Remove for cause.

36:02.796 --> 36:04.197
Denied.

36:04.931 --> 36:06.199
She basically just said

36:06.232 --> 36:07.568
she's prejudged
Dennis Mills guilty.

36:07.601 --> 36:08.468
No, she didn't.

36:08.501 --> 36:10.604
She said if a man
bludgeoned and stuffed.

36:10.637 --> 36:12.238
She didn't say
she necessarily believed

36:12.272 --> 36:13.339
it was your client.

36:14.340 --> 36:15.576
You want to use one
of your preemptories, fine,

36:15.609 --> 36:17.878
but the court
has no problem with her.

36:20.881 --> 36:23.617
Defense excuses
juror number four.

36:28.321 --> 36:28.989
That went well.

36:29.022 --> 36:29.823
How far did you get?

36:29.856 --> 36:31.825
Seven. The judge
isn't making it easy.

36:31.858 --> 36:32.726
What a surprise.

36:32.759 --> 36:33.827
Doaks: Counsel...

36:36.362 --> 36:38.464
I understand
you have some questions.

36:38.498 --> 36:39.800
I'm just doing
a little background

36:39.833 --> 36:41.668
on all
the state witnesses.

36:41.702 --> 36:42.703
Well, maybe I could do

36:42.736 --> 36:44.605
some background checks
of my own.

36:44.638 --> 36:45.839
Is that a threat,
detective?

36:45.872 --> 36:47.641
If you did your homework,
you'd know I'm in A. A.

36:47.674 --> 36:48.742
And I have been
for six months,

36:48.775 --> 36:50.243
you bottom-feeding grime.

36:50.276 --> 36:51.912
That's what you people are.

36:51.945 --> 36:53.680
Hey, you declared this
a fight.

36:53.714 --> 36:54.681
Get out of my face, pal!

36:54.715 --> 36:57.618
No, now I am officially
in your face, detective.

36:57.651 --> 36:59.686
You want it nasty?
Let's make it nasty.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.688
You want to investigate me?

37:01.722 --> 37:03.924
I have got a whole department
to investigate you.

37:03.957 --> 37:04.825
You do that,

37:04.858 --> 37:06.827
but you don't have
any power in that room.

37:06.860 --> 37:08.762
I do, and I can't wait

37:08.795 --> 37:10.463
to be calling you
to the stand.

37:10.496 --> 37:11.665
Do I look scared?

37:11.698 --> 37:13.934
You're too stupid
to be scared.

37:13.967 --> 37:16.970
All right, we're done here.

37:23.043 --> 37:24.678
Everybody's
just so nice here.

37:24.711 --> 37:25.946
Hey, what's going on?

37:25.979 --> 37:27.447
Oh, we were just mingling

37:27.480 --> 37:29.616
with another friendly member
of your sunshine state.

37:29.650 --> 37:31.752
Look, I'm adding
a witness to our list --

37:31.785 --> 37:33.887
Warren Rydell,
photographer.

37:33.920 --> 37:34.888
Who's he?

37:34.921 --> 37:36.890
He will introduce
and authenticate this picture.

37:36.923 --> 37:39.025
I'll probably be
calling him up first.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.461
What?
ELLENOR: Oh, gee.

37:41.494 --> 37:43.429
Just a picture of our client
standing with the victim,

37:43.463 --> 37:45.465
the woman he never met
in person.

37:56.610 --> 37:58.411
It's some kind of trick.

37:58.444 --> 37:59.345
That picture is real.

37:59.379 --> 38:01.447
It's not a trick,
and it's evidence that --

38:01.481 --> 38:02.949
No!

38:02.983 --> 38:05.686
Look, this is a museum
or something.

38:05.719 --> 38:07.554
Now, maybe I was there
when she was there,

38:07.588 --> 38:08.622
but we never met.

38:08.655 --> 38:11.357
She just happened to be there
standing 2 feet away?

38:11.391 --> 38:12.859
Somebody's...

38:15.829 --> 38:17.497
Oh, God.

38:17.531 --> 38:18.331
What?

38:18.364 --> 38:21.467
I told her I was going
to this opening.

38:21.501 --> 38:22.669
Stacey Kingman?

38:22.703 --> 38:23.804
Yes.

38:23.837 --> 38:25.471
Now, maybe she --

38:25.506 --> 38:27.674
she must have gone there
to see what I looked like.

38:27.708 --> 38:28.975
You never talked to her?

38:29.009 --> 38:29.910
No.

38:29.943 --> 38:31.878
Because, Dennis, if you did,

38:31.912 --> 38:34.347
maybe you held her glasses
for a second.

38:34.380 --> 38:35.916
That's how your prints
got into her house.

38:35.949 --> 38:37.551
Think about it.

38:37.584 --> 38:39.352
Maybe you did talk to her.

38:39.385 --> 38:42.488
I didn't, and you no longer
think I'm innocent.

38:42.523 --> 38:43.189
I do.

38:43.223 --> 38:44.490
Then why did you
ask me to lie?

38:44.525 --> 38:46.092
I am not asking you to lie.

38:46.126 --> 38:47.994
Stop raising your voice!
You spoon-fed me!

38:48.028 --> 38:48.929
You stop!

38:48.962 --> 38:51.431
Aah! Guard! Guard!

38:54.935 --> 38:55.769
I'm leaving.

38:55.802 --> 38:56.903
Please, don't.

38:56.937 --> 38:59.806
Please. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

39:03.577 --> 39:05.111
I'm sorry. I...

39:10.684 --> 39:12.385
Give me a minute.

39:29.102 --> 39:32.639
I have been here
for six months,

39:32.673 --> 39:34.975
and every time
they bring me food,

39:35.008 --> 39:36.910
every time
a person walks by,

39:36.943 --> 39:39.179
they look in here,

39:39.212 --> 39:42.448
and they just assume me
to be a killer.

39:46.587 --> 39:48.989
Even when my wife visits,

39:49.022 --> 39:51.091
I can see the doubt
in her eyes.

39:54.561 --> 39:57.030
I can't take it anymore.

39:57.063 --> 40:00.433
I just --
I'm starting to make...

40:03.637 --> 40:04.971
Stacey...

40:06.540 --> 40:09.976
Stacey must have wanted
to come check me out

40:10.010 --> 40:11.444
at the museum,

40:11.477 --> 40:15.015
but we never met.
We never spoke.

40:19.219 --> 40:21.021
It doesn't look good.

40:23.657 --> 40:27.694
I'm going to ask you
to consider the plea

40:27.728 --> 40:29.162
one more time.

40:41.207 --> 40:42.709
Okay.

40:45.111 --> 40:48.949
I didn't trust Jacobs,
but I do you.

40:49.683 --> 40:52.218
You tell me
to take manslaughter,

40:52.252 --> 40:53.987
I'll take it.

40:54.855 --> 40:58.491
Tell me,
whatever you say.

41:12.806 --> 41:14.575
Don't take it.

41:16.977 --> 41:18.712
We try the case?

41:19.079 --> 41:22.749
Death penalty on the line,
try the case?

41:24.551 --> 41:26.587
Try the case.

41:35.662 --> 41:37.030
How the hell
could you say that?

41:37.063 --> 41:39.032
It's all circumstantial.
We can make reasonable --

41:39.065 --> 41:40.867
Lindsay, he said he never
met the victim.

41:40.901 --> 41:43.670
Now they have a photograph
of the two of them together.

41:43.704 --> 41:45.271
That was a coincidence.
They were both attending --

41:45.305 --> 41:46.573
A coincidence?

41:46.607 --> 41:47.941
Or she went
to check him out,

41:47.974 --> 41:48.975
but they never met.

41:49.009 --> 41:51.111
Come on Lindsay, this guy is
dead in the water.

41:51.144 --> 41:53.046
He was open
to taking manslaughter.

41:53.079 --> 41:54.915
He was browbeaten into
considering manslaughter.

41:54.948 --> 41:55.949
I don't care.

41:55.982 --> 41:57.784
Any way he gets there,
he should be jumping at it.

41:57.818 --> 42:00.120
Don't be jumping on me!
It's practically malpractice --

42:00.153 --> 42:01.121
I said don't
be jumping on me!

42:01.154 --> 42:02.623
All right, all right

42:02.656 --> 42:03.824
Would everybody
just calm down?

42:03.857 --> 42:05.759
72 hours -- that's how
much time we have left.

42:05.792 --> 42:08.795
If we lose, he gets death,
death by lethal injection.

42:08.829 --> 42:09.896
They do that here.

42:09.930 --> 42:12.165
Tell me what the hell
we have to convince the jury

42:12.198 --> 42:13.133
of reasonable doubt?

42:13.166 --> 42:15.969
That isn't enough!
He didn't do it.
I know --

42:16.002 --> 42:17.270
Yes, it is.
We get people off.

42:17.303 --> 42:18.572
With evidence, not --

42:18.605 --> 42:20.541
He is innocent!

42:25.946 --> 42:28.114
He's innocent.

42:39.292 --> 42:41.962
All right, look.

42:43.196 --> 42:45.666
We all got on the plane
and came out here.

42:45.699 --> 42:48.301
It wasn't to get pushed around
by some judge,

42:48.334 --> 42:50.837
it wasn't to get spat on
by a cocky detective,

42:50.871 --> 42:52.238
and it wasn't to quit.

42:52.839 --> 42:55.776
Lindsay's right --
we're fighters.

42:55.809 --> 42:58.945
We flew across country
to fight for Dennis Mills,

42:59.312 --> 43:01.648
so that's what we do.

43:01.682 --> 43:02.783
72 hours from now,

43:02.816 --> 43:06.319
the gloves come off
and we do what we do.

43:06.352 --> 43:09.122
That judge, that D. A.,

43:09.155 --> 43:12.893
time for them
to get a taste of us.

43:31.344 --> 43:32.312
EUGENE YOUNG:
Next on "The Practice"...

43:32.345 --> 43:33.747
The dead body of someone

43:33.780 --> 43:36.316
you talked
about being lifeless

43:36.349 --> 43:37.818
ended up in your trunk.

43:37.851 --> 43:38.552
And I am telling you

43:38.585 --> 43:40.854
that somebody else
put her there.

43:41.187 --> 43:42.989
I've been sitting
in that chair for 20 years.

43:43.023 --> 43:45.391
I've bested F. Lee Bailey,
Johnnie Cochran.

43:45.425 --> 43:47.661
I think I can handle
Jimmy the grunt.

43:49.295 --> 43:51.097
Let's go.
We're walking out.

43:51.131 --> 43:53.066
Just do it. Let's go.
What?

43:53.099 --> 43:54.434
If you leave this room,

43:54.467 --> 43:57.137
I will hold all four of you
in contempt.

43:57.170 --> 43:58.672
If we're going to stay
in this room,

43:58.705 --> 44:00.240
then you will deal with us.

44:28.301 --> 44:29.335
You stinker!
