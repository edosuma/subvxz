- When?
- A few days?

00:04.648 --> 00:06.559
I came here on official bank business.

00:06.560 --> 00:08.408
And I also wanted to say good-bye.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.460

Hmm.

Oh, stop it. We needed one.

Why did you feel like we needed
a new television all of a sudden?

02:05.155 --> 02:06.757
I don't know. Maybe I was lonely.

All right, well, um...

11:39.403 --> 11:42.155
Uh, insurance is... it's
really expensive, Norman.

And I-I know the motel
hasn't been doing well and...

11:43.658 --> 11:46.155
There's other places to work
besides the motel, Sheriff.

11:46.156 --> 11:50.155
And other things that I can
be doing besides managing.

11:50.156 --> 11:52.155

confused and so vulnerable.

about how far you want
to push this, Norman.

12:32.156 --> 12:34.155
I'll let you know when
I have my own insurance

12:34.156 --> 12:37.155

paperwork for the divorce,

anything. What'd he say?

everything I've done for him.

You might as well tell me what's wrong.

I know you're angry.

It's not like I can pretend you're not

- You're ruining everything.
- Fine!

24:38.529 --> 24:40.529
I cannot believe that
you went behind my back

24:40.530 --> 24:43.356
to tell Alex that he and
I should get a divorce.

24:43.357 --> 24:44.528
Mother?

24:44.529 --> 24:46.528
You don't have to lie to me.

24:46.529 --> 24:49.528
I know you've been sleeping with him.

24:49.529 --> 24:51.528
That you had to do it
to get insurance for me.

24:51.529 --> 24:53.528
But that sort of thing is horrible,

24:53.529 --> 24:54.863

to live life like that.

24:54.864 --> 24:56.289
No one should.

But if I have learned
one thing at Pineview,

it is that sometimes you
have to let other people help

in order to alleviate your burdens.

25:05.057 --> 25:07.133

No. He's still upset.

38:49.563 --> 38:51.562
We are not in a sinking ship.

38:51.563 --> 38:53.562
We are in a big beautiful warm house,

38:53.563 --> 38:55.563
and we're all fine.

38:57.563 --> 38:59.467
You are such a hypocrite, Mother.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.897
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

39:02.898 --> 39:06.562
My whole life, you have
kept me so close to you

39:06.563 --> 39:08.562
that I couldn't breathe without you.

39:08.563 --> 39:11.064
You never wanted me to have a girlfriend

39:11.065 --> 39:12.562
or even a good time.

39:12.563 --> 39:14.897
I-I gave up everything.
Everything for you, Mother.

39:14.898 --> 39:16.562
And I did it gladly,

39:16.563 --> 39:18.897
because I understand
the bond between us...

39:18.898 --> 39:20.562
the cord.

39:20.563 --> 39:23.562
I understand that it is
huge and sacred and unique.

39:23.563 --> 39:25.562
And now you want to tell
me that doesn't matter.

39:25.563 --> 39:28.562
Now, all of a sudden, there's
room for someone else.

39:28.563 --> 39:29.897
Well, there isn't, a-and you know it.

39:29.898 --> 39:32.562
This is our world. Our world, Mother!

39:32.563 --> 39:34.897
And that's what love is. Real love.

39:34.898 --> 39:36.562
Not this pale corpse

39:36.563 --> 39:37.562
you're trying to put in its place,

39:37.563 --> 39:39.272
and you never will be able to.

39:39.273 --> 39:40.562
You are setting yourself up,

39:40.563 --> 39:43.562
and he is making you
think that it's possible!

39:43.563 --> 39:44.562
Get this through your head!

39:44.563 --> 39:46.562
No one is making me do anything!

39:46.563 --> 39:49.439
I am a grown woman.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.562
I love him. He loves me.

39:51.563 --> 39:53.064
And that is it.

39:53.065 --> 39:55.563
And you have to deal with it.

40:00.563 --> 40:03.562
<i>[exciting music]</i>

40:03.563 --> 40:04.897
[door slams]

40:11.065 --> 40:14.272
Let me talk to him.

40:19.262 --> 40:20.562
[door slams]

40:20.563 --> 40:23.562
<i>[tense music]</i>

40:34.898 --> 40:36.563
Norman.

40:38.563 --> 40:41.562
Norman.

40:41.563 --> 40:43.562
Now, put that thing down
and talk to me, Norman.

40:43.563 --> 40:45.064
What?

40:45.065 --> 40:46.563
Put it down.

40:48.563 --> 40:50.562
Put it down!

40:50.563 --> 40:52.562
What?

40:52.563 --> 40:53.897
You need to grow up a little right now,

40:53.898 --> 40:55.562
and you need to think of your mother.

40:55.563 --> 40:56.562
Don't patronize me.

40:56.563 --> 40:58.562
I have spent every
waking moment of my life

40:58.563 --> 41:00.562
thinking of my mother.

41:00.563 --> 41:03.439
Well, then you need to think of
her as a human being, Norman.

41:03.440 --> 41:04.562
She's always gonna be your mother.

41:04.563 --> 41:07.562
Nothing's ever gonna change that.

41:07.563 --> 41:08.897
But don't you think she
wants to be with someone?

41:08.898 --> 41:10.563
W-w-with a partner?

41:10.564 --> 41:12.562
A friend? A lover?

41:12.563 --> 41:13.562
Someone she can share her life with?

41:13.563 --> 41:15.562
I mean, why is that
such a terrible thing?

41:15.563 --> 41:18.272
Don't you think she deserves
to have a man in her life?

41:18.273 --> 41:21.272
<i>[dramatic music building]</i>

41:26.563 --> 41:28.562
Put that down.

41:28.563 --> 41:30.562
Oh, back up. Back up.

41:37.065 --> 41:38.562
Back up.

41:41.262 --> 41:42.562
Aah!

41:42.563 --> 41:45.562
I hate you!

41:45.563 --> 41:47.562
I hate you!

41:47.563 --> 41:50.562
I hate you so much!

41:51.564 --> 41:53.563
Ah...

42:04.563 --> 42:06.562
Norman?

42:10.563 --> 42:12.562
What happened?

42:12.563 --> 42:13.562
I'm moving back in.

42:13.563 --> 42:15.562
I'll go home and get my stuff tomorrow.

42:15.563 --> 42:17.897
But I'm not leaving this house tonight.
