WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:03.168
Wow!

00:04.839 --> 00:07.606
Oh, football!
Can I watch too?

00:07.608 --> 00:10.109
Oh, ALF, last time we
watched football together

00:10.111 --> 00:12.511
you belched all through
the whole game.

00:12.513 --> 00:16.215
Hey! That's how
we applaud on Melmac.

00:16.217 --> 00:18.017
Hey, good catch.

00:18.019 --> 00:19.551
[burps]

00:21.188 --> 00:23.689
No more applause please.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.091
Alright, I'll just clap.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.595
No.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.464
Hey, dad, want to play football?

00:32.466 --> 00:36.535
Oh! Yeah. Sure. Why not?
It's almost half-time anyway.

00:36.537 --> 00:37.669
Can I play too?

00:37.671 --> 00:40.039
Oh, sure. Come on.
Kate, we'll all play.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.306
I'll pass.

00:41.308 --> 00:43.475
No, I wanna pass.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.578
I mean I don't wanna play.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.481
Why, 'cause I won't
let you pass?

00:51.085 --> 00:53.118
Come on, ALF.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.788
[burps]

00:57.858 --> 00:59.758
I said no applause.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.328
That wasn't applause,
that was root beer.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.599
[theme music]

01:37.431 --> 01:40.632
[music continues]

02:07.228 --> 02:10.395
[instrumental music]

02:12.266 --> 02:14.766
That was quick. What happened
to your football game?

02:14.768 --> 02:17.669
The game was called
on account of ALF.

02:17.671 --> 02:20.672
Yeah, first, he sat
on the sidelines

02:20.674 --> 02:22.808
spat into his helmet.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.344
Then he said
we weren't playing right.

02:25.346 --> 02:28.614
Yeah, he sent Brian off on
a very complicated pass pattern

02:28.616 --> 02:31.750
and he told him
to slant left, button hook.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.653
Hop up and down,
put on a disguise

02:34.655 --> 02:36.488
- Dig a hole.
- Dig a hole, right.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.191
Stay in it until
Groundhog's Day.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.793
Then do the hokey pokey
and turn myself around.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.663
Yeah, turn yourself around,
uh-huh.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.366
That would fake out
the other team.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.269
So we're going to watch
the game on TV.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.971
Think we'll get
a better workout that way.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.673
(ALF)
'Post pattern, Willie.'

02:54.675 --> 02:57.242
- No, no. No!
- 'Heads up!'

02:59.446 --> 03:03.182
Ahem. What happened?
Did we score?

03:03.184 --> 03:07.152
No, it was intercepted
by my dinnerware.

03:07.154 --> 03:10.622
What do you expect, when you
leave plates in the end zone?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.693
Keep this outside!

03:14.695 --> 03:19.331
Hey, hey, watch it!
You'll break the grass.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.667
[instrumental music]

03:25.539 --> 03:28.207
Mmm. Great meal, mom,
what's for dessert?

03:28.209 --> 03:29.541
You can't have dessert

03:29.543 --> 03:31.677
till all the other
food's been served.

03:31.679 --> 03:34.513
All the other food
has been served.

03:34.515 --> 03:37.416
That's it? One measly ham?

03:37.418 --> 03:40.519
Why did I work up an appetite
playing football?

03:40.521 --> 03:42.054
Who were you playing
football with?

03:42.056 --> 03:44.890
- He played by himself.
- And I won.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.392
In overtime.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.329
You didn't trample
my flower garden, did you?

03:50.331 --> 03:54.566
Don't worry, I tip-toed
through your tulips.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.001
- Let's see your feet.
- Hmm?

03:56.003 --> 03:57.502
Feet!

04:00.241 --> 04:04.710
You tip-toed through my tulips,
but you demolished my daisies.

04:04.712 --> 04:09.047
Well, don't worry. I high-tailed
it past your hyacinths.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.515
Your turn.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.050
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

04:12.052 --> 04:15.754
- Thank you, Lynn.
- Now, where were we, ALF?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.789
Well, If I remember correctly

04:17.791 --> 04:20.692
you were about to give
me a foot massage.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.097
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Ochmonek.
- Hello, Lynn.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.099
I would like speak with
your mother and father.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.501
Sure. Mom, dad.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.770
Oh, is that our football?

04:31.772 --> 04:34.139
Well, it's definitely
not mine.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.407
Hi, Raquel.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.909
Raquel, is something
the matter?

04:37.911 --> 04:40.946
Do you know how this football,
got into our backyard?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.447
Uh, not exactly.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.450
Uh, Brian was playing with it.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.452
He probably kicked
it over the fence.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.788
- Well, it broke our window.
- Oh!

04:49.790 --> 04:53.725
I'm so sorry, I'll..
I'll pay for it, of course--

04:53.727 --> 04:57.062
Our very<i> large</i> picture window.

04:59.233 --> 05:00.799
I'll get your checkbook.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.802
Oh, no, that's alright.
Raquel, just send us the bill.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.304
Fine, but please
speak to Brian.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.906
Criminal behavior should
be nipped in the bud.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.308
Criminal behavior?

05:09.310 --> 05:13.078
Breaking windows today could
lead to robbing banks tomorrow.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.647
Brian, a bank robber?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.316
Al Capone was a good boy

05:17.318 --> 05:19.651
until he broke
my grandfather's window.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.154
Of course he pushed
my grandfather through it.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.556
But the result was the same.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.495
[sighs]

05:30.497 --> 05:33.598
- ALF!
- 'Yes!'

05:33.600 --> 05:37.669
- Come here.
- 'No problem.'

05:40.774 --> 05:44.109
Kate, I'm sorry
about your flowers.

05:44.111 --> 05:47.846
Please accept these
along with my apologies.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.017
They smell like feet.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.419
I washed them in Desenex.

05:56.223 --> 05:59.958
ALF, where is our football?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.460
Behind your back.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.797
Raquel said
it broke her window.

06:05.799 --> 06:09.701
Well, that's ridiculous!
Footballs don't break windows.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.337
- People do.
- What about aliens?

06:12.339 --> 06:15.040
Me? I broke nothing I swear.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.209
You broke those plates
when you threw the football

06:17.211 --> 06:18.744
through my kitchen window.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.113
Oh, like that's relevant.

06:22.916 --> 06:28.186
ALF, how did this football get
into the Ochmoneks' backyard?

06:28.188 --> 06:30.489
Well, I have a theory.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.157
<i> Please</i> share it.

06:32.159 --> 06:35.827
Alright. See, I was
standing near the fence.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.830
I kicked the football,
it went up

06:38.832 --> 06:41.666
but it never came back down.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.368
So what's your theory?

06:43.370 --> 06:46.071
Well, isn't it obvious?
Gravity failure.

06:47.374 --> 06:51.543
The football came down
in the Ochmoneks' backyard

06:51.545 --> 06:53.779
and then it broke their window.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.881
Well, I find that
hard to believe.

06:55.883 --> 06:59.584
See, if there's one sound I
recognize, it's glass breaking.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.086
Also China breaking

07:01.088 --> 07:04.222
ceramics breaking,
appliances breaking.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.724
I think my point is made.

07:05.726 --> 07:08.460
Dad, we can't really be sure
that ALF broke the window.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.629
Thank you, Lynn.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.264
Maybe Lynn broke it.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.467
I didn't, but there could
be other explanations.

07:15.469 --> 07:18.537
Well, yeah. There could be
lots of explanations.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.938
Like what?

07:19.940 --> 07:21.306
Explanation one.

07:21.308 --> 07:24.776
The Ochmoneks invited
Ella Fitzgerald over for tea.

07:24.778 --> 07:28.980
Ella hits a high C,
whammo, there goes the window!

07:28.982 --> 07:31.950
Explanation two,
Dough Henning comes over.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.286
He accidentally levitates
Trevor through--

07:34.288 --> 07:36.655
Stop this, stop this!

07:36.657 --> 07:38.757
But I have 18 more.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.793
Although the last few
are a little far-fetched.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.162
Explanation three,
what happened--

07:44.164 --> 07:46.898
- What did ALF do this time?
- Nothing.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.900
Somebody broke
the Ochmoneks' window

07:48.902 --> 07:50.802
and we're trying to
figure out who it was.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.337
Say, it wasn't you,
was it Brian?

07:52.339 --> 07:53.638
No.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.974
Brian dear, this
is very important--

07:55.976 --> 07:58.944
Hey, if the kid said he didn't
do it, he didn't do it.

07:58.946 --> 08:01.346
- Stop with the third degree.
- Fine.

08:01.348 --> 08:04.082
If he didn't do it, that makes
you the prime suspect.

08:05.619 --> 08:08.153
Brian dear,
this is very important.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.590
- Did you break the window?
- No.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.359
Huh! Who could it have been?

08:14.361 --> 08:16.328
It could have been..

08:16.330 --> 08:17.829
...you.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.500
Or Ella, don't count her out.

08:21.502 --> 08:25.670
Alright, that's it. You're not
watching TV for one month.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.672
Why, what did I do?

08:27.674 --> 08:30.008
You can't punish me
without a just cause.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.844
- I demand a trial.
- There's no need for a trial.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.346
Forget the trial.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.848
So you<i> do</i> think I'm guilty.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.851
You're punishing
an innocent alien.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.186
Dad, maybe ALF
should get a trial.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.388
I mean, we don't know
for sure that he did it.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.723
Yeah, dad, my teacher said

08:44.725 --> 08:48.493
everyone's innocent
until proven guilty.

08:48.495 --> 08:50.195
And he does look sincere.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.733
He looks like he's
trying for an Oscar.

08:56.370 --> 09:01.406
Okay, fine. ALF gets
his trial. I'll be the judge.

09:01.408 --> 09:05.243
Oh, no offense, Willie,
but I prefer a fair trial.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.947
What you trust mom
to be the judge?

09:12.152 --> 09:13.652
Without hesitation.

09:15.222 --> 09:18.523
I'm not gonna be the judge, and
there's not gonna be a trial.

09:18.525 --> 09:23.061
Look, I know my rights. I want
my day in court and that's that!

09:23.063 --> 09:27.265
If I'm found guilty,
I'll take the month with no TV.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.568
Okay.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.937
Okay, fine. Present your case.

09:31.939 --> 09:35.240
<i> Now?</i> I need time to prepare.

09:35.242 --> 09:39.044
Listen, mister, you are
the one who asked for a trial.

09:39.046 --> 09:43.081
But I need subpoenas,
and affidavits, and a secretary

09:43.083 --> 09:45.917
who could spell those things.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.686
Okay, we'll have a trial

09:47.688 --> 09:50.589
tomorrow morning
after breakfast.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.924
Fine, whatever you say,
Your Honor.

09:52.926 --> 09:56.094
I respect your judgment
and I'm not just saying that.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.763
- Stop kissing up.
- I'm not kissing up.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.967
I'm innocent.
Why should I have to kiss up?

10:01.969 --> 10:05.937
By the way, I love what
you've done with your hair.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.973
- Stop it.
- I'm stopped.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.774
It's stopped. You're right.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.543
You're brilliant.
She's brilliant.

10:11.545 --> 10:13.278
She's really is.
She's brilliant.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.114
No more kissing up. Not if she
doesn't want me to kiss up.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.050
I wouldn't kiss up
to the judge. Nuh-uh. No, no.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.988
[instrumental music]

10:24.224 --> 10:28.093
Hear ye, hear ye!
Court is now in session.

10:28.095 --> 10:31.062
Honorable Judge Mom presiding.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.899
Thank you, Brian,
that was very good.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.470
- Where's ALF?
- Here he comes.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.639
F. Lee Shumway.

10:40.641 --> 10:43.274
In my best suit.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.510
Hey, you're gonna
lose more than your suit

10:45.512 --> 10:47.946
when this case is over.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.681
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor.

10:49.683 --> 10:52.784
My client had to
visit the bathroom.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.319
Did you have to go now?

10:54.321 --> 10:56.187
Yes, or I would have
done something

10:56.189 --> 10:59.090
to make the court
hold me in contempt.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.161
- Could we start now, honey?
- Objection!

11:03.163 --> 11:06.297
There can be no justice
if I call you Your Honor

11:06.299 --> 11:09.000
but the prosecution
calls you honey.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.836
It doesn't matter, ALF.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.838
Perhaps a compromise.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.074
We'll call you Your Honey.

11:17.310 --> 11:20.178
Uh, let me add that
your dress is a perfect choice.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.681
Authoritative, yet feminine.

11:22.683 --> 11:25.283
It's<i> ridiculous!</i>

11:25.285 --> 11:28.353
Let the record show that
Willie hates your dress.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.289
Willie gave me this dress.

11:32.626 --> 11:34.459
Oh, bribing the judge, huh?

11:36.196 --> 11:39.397
Willie, uh, I guess you have,
what, an opening statement?

11:39.399 --> 11:40.965
[clears throat]
That won't take long.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.301
Simply put,
ALF broke the window.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.504
Oh, great speech, counselor.
I'm a goner.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.573
Ha, ha, ha!

11:48.575 --> 11:51.543
ALF, I presume that you
have an opening statement.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.745
A brief comment.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.548
Since the dawn of time,
the innocent

11:56.550 --> 11:58.683
have been unjustly accused.

11:58.685 --> 12:01.386
Adam and Eve were evicted
from the Garden of Eden

12:01.388 --> 12:04.489
on a trumped-up charge
of eating an apple.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.257
But Adam and Eve were guilty.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.827
- Says who?
- Says God.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.996
Moving on.

12:11.998 --> 12:15.567
We come to the case
of Cain versus Abel.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.236
Is this gonna be a trip
through recorded history?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.772
Your Honor, the importance
of this case demands

12:20.774 --> 12:22.407
that every President
be made of--

12:22.409 --> 12:26.177
Because if so, we're gonna
have to forget about lunch.

12:26.179 --> 12:29.781
Then to sum it up,
ALF did not break the window.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.182
Let's eat.

12:32.586 --> 12:35.487
I think we'd better finish
with the trial first.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.057
Willie, present your evidence.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.192
The case is simple, Your Honor

12:41.194 --> 12:43.628
what we have here
is a broken window

12:43.630 --> 12:47.732
and we have a defendant
with a long,<i> long</i> history

12:47.734 --> 12:49.267
of reckless behavior.

12:49.269 --> 12:53.972
Starting with the day he crashed
his spaceship into our garage.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.607
Name 12 more.

12:56.610 --> 12:59.444
To name,<i> just</i> 12 more..

12:59.446 --> 13:03.314
He set a fire in the camper,
he chopped up our Christmas tree

13:03.316 --> 13:05.784
he wrecked the toaster,
he ripped that painting

13:05.786 --> 13:07.919
'he dug up the backyard,
he stole a car'

13:07.921 --> 13:09.420
he buried my piano.

13:09.422 --> 13:12.490
I think that's the thing
that hurt me the most.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.793
He got me arrested,
he used our credit cards

13:14.795 --> 13:18.730
excessively and illegally, he
short-circuited the television

13:18.732 --> 13:22.634
he terrorized the cat,
and he blew up the kitchen.

13:22.636 --> 13:26.304
So it's not hard to imagine
that such a person would, could

13:26.306 --> 13:31.309
and in fact did kick a football
through the Ochmoneks' window.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.577
Brilliant!

13:36.750 --> 13:38.983
Did I do all that?

13:38.985 --> 13:42.287
I'm afraid so. We went over
the list last night.

13:42.289 --> 13:43.755
Where?

13:43.757 --> 13:45.123
In bed.

13:45.125 --> 13:48.459
Objection! I'm up all night
with law books

13:48.461 --> 13:53.031
while you're in bed
with that ambulance chaser.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.501
You are out of order.

13:56.503 --> 14:00.271
I withdraw the slur
on my profession.

14:00.273 --> 14:05.176
I'd like to ask the defendant
a couple of questions, if I may.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.646
My client has nothing to hide.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.181
(Willie)
Thank you.

14:10.183 --> 14:14.085
As regards this broken window,
do you have an alibi?

14:14.855 --> 14:16.020
No.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.555
By your own admission,
you kicked

14:17.557 --> 14:20.525
that football into
the Ochmoneks' backyard?

14:20.527 --> 14:24.896
By my own admission,
I never heard anything break.

14:24.898 --> 14:30.068
If a window breaks in the woods,
and there's no one to hear it..

14:30.070 --> 14:33.037
...is it really broken?

14:33.039 --> 14:35.640
If you were in
the woods, uh, yeah.

14:38.712 --> 14:44.048
Do you still claim that Ella
Fitzgerald broke that window?

14:44.050 --> 14:45.383
That's entirely possible.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.585
- It is not possible.
- It is possible!

14:47.587 --> 14:50.555
It is not possible
because Ella Fitzgerald

14:50.557 --> 14:52.891
on the day in question
was out of town

14:52.893 --> 14:54.225
I've checked that out.

14:54.227 --> 14:58.730
Yeah? Would you know
where Beverly Sills was?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.465
I have no further questions.

15:01.501 --> 15:05.036
That's it?
That's your whole case?

15:05.038 --> 15:07.005
You're a disgrace
to the legal profession.

15:07.007 --> 15:10.608
Yeah, well, you don't know
your habeas from your corpus.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.977
Don't drag this into the gutter.

15:15.849 --> 15:18.116
I call to the stand..

15:20.921 --> 15:22.186
What's wrong?

15:23.123 --> 15:25.089
You ruined my dramatic pause.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.926
I was about to name
a surprise witness.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.227
Sorry.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.596
I call to the stand..

15:31.598 --> 15:33.865
...Lynn Tanner.

15:33.867 --> 15:36.200
- Me?
- Surprise!

15:43.276 --> 15:44.976
How long have you
known the defendant?

15:44.978 --> 15:46.411
I have known you..

15:46.413 --> 15:49.314
I mean the defendant
about a year.

15:49.316 --> 15:55.053
Would you say that the defendant
has any<i> saintly</i> qualities?

15:55.055 --> 15:58.122
Well, he resembles
a Saint Bernard.

16:02.996 --> 16:05.063
Quiet, shyster.

16:07.767 --> 16:11.269
Do you think that the
defendant broke the window?

16:11.271 --> 16:14.138
- I guess not.
- Thanks, you're out of here.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.507
Next witness,
I'd like to call..

16:16.509 --> 16:18.576
But let me check
something first.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.311
Brian, come here.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.016
Do you think
I broke the window?

16:25.018 --> 16:26.551
I don't know.

16:28.021 --> 16:30.154
Well, think about it.

16:30.156 --> 16:33.124
I call Brian Tanner
to the stand.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.960
He gave him a bribe!

16:35.962 --> 16:38.963
I prefer to think of it
as an early birthday present.

16:38.965 --> 16:40.198
Thanks, ALF.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.835
Are there any other witnesses?

16:43.837 --> 16:45.169
Yes, Your Honor.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.305
I'd like to call
myself to the stand.

16:47.307 --> 16:50.274
- Oh, brother!
- No, no, no. It's alright.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.610
- ALF, go ahead.
- Thank you.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.351
Did you break the window?

17:01.388 --> 17:02.887
No.

17:02.889 --> 17:06.357
But you don't even know what
window we're talking about.

17:06.359 --> 17:09.827
Well, I assume that you, you
meant the Ochmoneks' window.

17:09.829 --> 17:13.398
Oh, just like we're supposed
to assume your innocence!

17:13.400 --> 17:16.401
- Well, I--
- What are you doing?

17:16.403 --> 17:19.303
I'm just trying to spice
up the proceedings.

17:20.306 --> 17:21.973
I don't wanna hear anymore.

17:21.975 --> 17:23.875
Case dismissed then.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.510
- Objection.
- Sustained.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.713
Figures. I want this case
thrown out of court.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.314
Why?

17:30.316 --> 17:31.816
Because I'm losing.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.919
Summaries?

17:34.921 --> 17:37.288
- ALF did it.
- No, I didn't.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.559
Okay, I'll decide on my verdict.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.227
Take your time,
Your Honor.

17:43.229 --> 17:46.097
Assess and reassess
the evidence before you.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.066
I don't care if it takes days

17:48.068 --> 17:50.601
weeks, months,
to reach a verdict.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.905
Just as long as
justice is served

17:53.907 --> 17:56.140
and I'm found not guilty.

17:57.677 --> 17:58.910
I'm done.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.912
Already?

18:00.914 --> 18:04.015
Well, is it a good verdict
or a bad verdict?

18:04.017 --> 18:05.283
Bad.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.086
Bad for me
or bad for him?

18:08.088 --> 18:09.620
Bad for you.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.125
Then don't tell me what it is.

18:14.127 --> 18:16.527
And please, I'd like
you to accept this

18:16.529 --> 18:19.864
lovely expensive
parting gift.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.335
No, thank you.

18:25.939 --> 18:30.675
As agreed, I sentence you
to 30 days with no TV.

18:32.145 --> 18:35.980
Alright, alright.
I've changed my mind.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.615
I don't want a trial.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.854
[instrumental music]

18:45.792 --> 18:50.795
Well, 9 o'clock.
Time for "Golden Girls."

18:50.797 --> 18:54.632
So, Blanche, who are you
gonna sleep with tonight?

18:54.634 --> 18:55.766
Everybody.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.469
Ha, ha, ha!

18:59.906 --> 19:01.239
What are you doing?

19:01.241 --> 19:04.575
Watching "Golden Girls."
What does it look like?

19:06.146 --> 19:07.778
Say, hello, Sophia.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.248
Not now. I have to
go to the bathroom

19:10.250 --> 19:13.317
before I lose my seat. Ha, ha!

19:13.319 --> 19:15.153
- ALF.
- You're right.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.488
They do the same jokes
every week.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.357
Hit the music, will ya?

19:19.359 --> 19:21.559
I'm gonna watch "Dance Fever."

19:23.496 --> 19:25.696
[instrumental music on stereo]

19:26.833 --> 19:29.700
Yeah! Go, Feverettes!

19:32.038 --> 19:34.772
ALF, I think you're losing it.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.175
Then stick me
in a state hospital.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.443
One with a big screen TV.

19:39.445 --> 19:42.947
I'm sorry. But you're
the one who wanted a trial.

19:42.949 --> 19:46.150
Yeah, I also thought
justice would triumph.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.818
But I was wrong.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.888
I'm being punished for
a crime I didn't commit.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.524
You really didn't
do it, did you?

19:53.526 --> 19:55.493
No.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.695
You believe me, don't you, Lynn?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.363
Of course I do.

19:59.365 --> 20:03.167
Thanks. I just wish
I had a better lawyer.

20:03.169 --> 20:07.338
Oh, ALF, I think, you did fine.
You handled yourself very well.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.373
Would you let me represent you?

20:11.044 --> 20:12.577
Without hesitation.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.613
[doorbell dings]

20:20.753 --> 20:23.387
- Oh, hi, Trevor.
- How ya doin', Willie?

20:23.389 --> 20:25.389
What can we do for you?

20:25.391 --> 20:28.392
Well, actually,
I came to see Brian.

20:28.394 --> 20:32.330
You came to see me?
What about?

20:32.332 --> 20:33.831
About the window.

20:35.902 --> 20:39.036
I'm sorry you got blamed
for something I did.

20:39.038 --> 20:41.205
You broke the window?

20:41.207 --> 20:42.740
Yeah.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.509
You see, I found
your football in my backyard

20:45.511 --> 20:48.746
and I started to relive
my glory days as a quarterback.

20:49.916 --> 20:53.117
I played for seven
years in high school.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.086
You must have been very good.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.555
- Uh, at sports.
- Oh, yeah.

20:57.557 --> 21:00.391
Anyway, I tried to
complete a pass

21:00.393 --> 21:03.094
between the birdbath
and the sundial.

21:03.096 --> 21:06.864
But it bounced off the porcelain
gnome and broke the window.

21:06.866 --> 21:10.434
Well, why didn't you
just tell Raquel?

21:10.436 --> 21:13.704
I wanted to protect
her image of me.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.574
She still thinks of me
as her football hero.

21:16.576 --> 21:19.710
- So you told her Brian did it?
- Oh, no.

21:19.712 --> 21:23.080
I didn't find out till this
morning she blamed him.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.216
And then when I saw
"I'm innocent" spray painted

21:25.218 --> 21:28.853
on your bathroom window
I figured I'd better fess up.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.289
I'm sorry, little guy.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.758
It's okay, big guy.

21:33.760 --> 21:38.729
Oh, by the way, Brian, there's
only one 'S' in innocent.

21:38.731 --> 21:39.864
Thanks.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.233
Well..

21:42.235 --> 21:44.302
...case dismissed.

21:44.304 --> 21:47.638
- What?
- Uh..

21:47.640 --> 21:49.840
Nothing.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.676
I hope I didn't cause
too much trouble.

21:51.678 --> 21:54.111
Oh, that's okay,
Trevor, it's over now.

21:54.113 --> 21:56.480
Actually, it's kind of sweet
that you still care so much

21:56.482 --> 21:57.782
what Raquel thinks.

21:57.784 --> 22:00.618
And I guess we're just
a couple of romantics.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.687
Sometimes I put on
my old letter sweater

22:02.689 --> 22:05.990
Raquel wears her cheerleader
outfit, and we tap a keg.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.325
Just like the old days.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.660
Raquel was a cheerleader?

22:09.662 --> 22:12.263
Still has the same figure
she had in high school.

22:12.265 --> 22:14.098
No kidding.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.167
Of course she works at it.

22:16.169 --> 22:17.835
- Bye, I'll see you, Willie.
- Well, thanks.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.437
Trevor, thanks for
clearing all that up.

22:19.439 --> 22:20.971
Oh, I had to.

22:20.973 --> 22:24.308
Once I found that Raquel
wanted you to pay this bill.

22:24.310 --> 22:26.510
The least I could do
is go halfsies.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.047
Eh, it's on me.

22:34.620 --> 22:38.556
Well, Willie, as my last
official act as judge

22:38.558 --> 22:40.524
I suggest we apologize to ALF.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.727
Yeah, I better.
I'd better do it.

22:42.729 --> 22:45.963
After all, I was the prosecutor.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.365
[chuckles]

22:47.367 --> 22:50.601
[glass shattering]

22:53.906 --> 22:57.708
Hear ye, hear ye,
court is now in session.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.250
[laughing]

23:06.252 --> 23:08.586
Yeah, yeah!

23:08.588 --> 23:12.390
Oh, don't be fool.
You're not the father.

23:12.392 --> 23:14.024
Buy a vowel.

23:14.026 --> 23:17.261
- What are you doing?
- I'm watching TVs.

23:17.263 --> 23:20.664
Turn two of those off.
You're wasting electricity.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.868
Hey, Willie, you owe me.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.437
You made me feel like
a common criminal.

23:26.439 --> 23:28.839
You've scarred me for life

23:28.841 --> 23:32.543
and now you want to
take away my TVs?

23:32.545 --> 23:36.013
At long last,
"Will-De-Beast."

23:36.015 --> 23:38.916
Have you no sense
of decency?

23:38.918 --> 23:43.921
ALF, how long are you gonna
push this guilt trip on me?

23:43.923 --> 23:46.157
I was thinking till
after Christmas.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.859
Think again.

23:50.696 --> 23:52.596
Hey, Willie,
while you're in there

23:52.598 --> 23:55.666
could you check on
my three TV dinners?

24:00.440 --> 24:03.707
Ha, ha, ha! Oh, yeah!

24:04.277 --> 24:07.511
[theme music]
