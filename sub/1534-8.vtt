<i>Previously on Once Upon A Time...</i>

00:04.518 --> 00:07.933
Soon I will have what I
want. A family that loves me.

00:07.933 --> 00:10.835
Sometimes, ordinary objects

00:10.870 --> 00:13.371
can come to possess their
own special kind of magic.

00:13.405 --> 00:16.207
I'm ready to make that
deal. I want my ribbons back.

00:16.241 --> 00:18.292
I'm no longer convinced
you have anything I want.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.378
You want what all villains want.

00:20.412 --> 00:21.579
Everything.

00:21.614 --> 00:23.481
The apprentice: Every dark one tries.

00:23.516 --> 00:25.517
Every one fails.

00:25.551 --> 00:28.234
You will never collect enough
power to do what you want.

00:28.234 --> 00:32.023
Oh, I will. But, alas, you
won't be there to see it.

00:32.057 --> 00:34.358
If you truly want to save Marian...

00:34.393 --> 00:36.927
You're gonna have to forget about me.

00:36.961 --> 00:40.097
You were planning to use
this to strip away her magic.

00:40.132 --> 00:41.532
No, that's not why I had it.

00:41.566 --> 00:43.367
The family that you think you have...

00:43.402 --> 00:44.439
They may love you...

00:44.439 --> 00:46.269
Keep your distance.
I don't want to hurt anyone.

00:46.270 --> 00:47.838
- But they also fear you.
- Let me go!

00:48.973 --> 00:50.407
Emma!

00:50.441 --> 00:51.442
Did you find her?

00:51.442 --> 00:53.376
David: No. We looked everywhere.

00:53.411 --> 00:55.345
She doesn't want to be found.

01:57.706 --> 01:59.707
[Birds chirping]

02:20.495 --> 02:23.130
I know who you are.

02:23.164 --> 02:24.964
And I can be of no help to you.

02:24.999 --> 02:26.466
No, of course not.

02:26.501 --> 02:28.602
You're an errand boy long past his prime.

02:28.636 --> 02:32.172
I wish to speak to the one you work for.

02:32.206 --> 02:35.808
There are many who desire an
audience with the sorcerer,

02:35.843 --> 02:39.446
but he speaks only through his apprentice.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.281
Then tell him, apprentice,

02:42.315 --> 02:44.517
I wish to make a deal.

02:44.551 --> 02:46.686
The sorcerer does not make petty deals,

02:46.720 --> 02:49.856
especially with those who have
succumbed to the darkness...

02:49.890 --> 02:51.524
Like you.

02:51.558 --> 02:54.326
I think in this case, he
might make a small exception.

02:54.361 --> 02:55.895
We'll see.

02:55.929 --> 02:57.796
I have his hat.

02:59.566 --> 03:02.535
You have no idea

03:02.569 --> 03:05.737
the forces you are dealing with.

03:11.911 --> 03:14.046
Hmm.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.882
Tell me where it is.

03:16.916 --> 03:20.385
Oh. No.

03:20.419 --> 03:22.688
Did you think that I was foolish enough

03:22.722 --> 03:24.189
to bring it with me?

03:24.223 --> 03:28.359
The hat is hidden far away.

03:28.394 --> 03:32.029
And unless he gives me what I want,

03:32.064 --> 03:35.900
the sorcerer will never see his hat again.

03:39.871 --> 03:44.175
And what is it that you so desire?

03:44.210 --> 03:45.610
Happiness.

03:45.644 --> 03:50.948
The kind I haven't
known in a long time...

03:50.982 --> 03:54.118
since I was a little girl,

03:54.152 --> 03:57.188
running in a field with my sisters,

03:57.222 --> 03:59.690
chasing a kite.

03:59.725 --> 04:02.059
Our love made us strong.

04:02.094 --> 04:03.960
Until it didn't.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.263
My sisters could never accept who I was

04:06.297 --> 04:10.767
because they were... ordinary.

04:10.801 --> 04:16.607
I want two new sisters,
born with magic, like me.

04:16.641 --> 04:19.274
My niece, Elsa, will be joining me.

04:19.309 --> 04:21.945
We need a third magical sister...

04:21.978 --> 04:23.747
a perfect match.

04:23.781 --> 04:25.749
A match like that

04:25.783 --> 04:29.418
will be extremely hard to come by.

04:29.453 --> 04:31.755
It could take time.

04:31.789 --> 04:36.425
Tell the sorcerer I am
a very patient woman.

04:36.460 --> 04:39.094
I am willing to wait as long as it takes

04:39.129 --> 04:43.799
to find a perfect sister.

Henry: Mom?

05:05.655 --> 05:07.622
Henry, what are you doing here?

05:07.657 --> 05:09.457
I've been out all night looking for you.

05:09.492 --> 05:11.793
- Everyone has.
- I told them all to stay away.

05:11.827 --> 05:13.795
I can't control my powers right now.

05:13.829 --> 05:15.363
Listen, don't worry about me.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.198
I'm gonna find a way to fix this,

05:17.232 --> 05:19.033
but until I do...

05:19.067 --> 05:21.594
- You got to go.
- No.

05:21.594 --> 05:23.638
You always think that
pulling away from people

05:23.673 --> 05:26.874
will fix your problems, but it never does.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.542
I can help you.

05:28.576 --> 05:30.778
Henry, just wait. I...

05:32.080 --> 05:34.315
Henry!

05:34.349 --> 05:36.450
[Groans]

05:36.484 --> 05:38.452
Henry, are you okay?

05:40.022 --> 05:43.324
You okay?

05:43.358 --> 05:44.792
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

05:44.826 --> 05:46.993
Is that a cut? Henry, what did I do?

05:49.331 --> 05:51.231
I-it's fine. I'm okay.

05:51.265 --> 05:52.999
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

05:53.034 --> 05:54.392
Mom.

05:54.392 --> 05:56.203
Stop! Please, don't come any closer.

05:56.237 --> 05:59.172
I love you, kid, but you got to go.

05:59.207 --> 06:00.874
Just go!

06:12.786 --> 06:15.388
[Breathing heavily]

06:15.422 --> 06:19.392
I know exactly how you feel...

06:19.426 --> 06:21.126
Seeing the fear in his eyes.

06:23.930 --> 06:25.498
[Breathing heavily]

06:25.532 --> 06:27.867
You are out of control.

06:27.901 --> 06:30.403
<i>But, Emma, you're not going to hurt me.</i>

06:30.437 --> 06:35.274
Nor should you. I'm on your side.

06:35.308 --> 06:38.277
Just leave me the hell alone.

06:38.311 --> 06:43.115
You can run, but it won't help.

06:43.149 --> 06:46.451
The only way this ends

06:46.486 --> 06:50.021
is you embracing who you are.

06:50.055 --> 06:52.524
If it means hurting people I love,

06:52.558 --> 06:54.959
no, thanks.

07:35.610 --> 07:36.961
Mm, good morning.

07:38.618 --> 07:41.586
Well, look who's finally woken up.

07:41.621 --> 07:44.589
I apologize, but, uh,

07:44.624 --> 07:45.886
that was the best...

07:46.557 --> 07:50.860
Sleep I've had in a very long time.

07:50.895 --> 07:54.196
How would you like to
come back to my camp...

07:54.231 --> 07:55.865
And let me cook you breakfast?

07:55.900 --> 07:58.767
Ohh, that sounds lovely,

07:58.802 --> 08:01.437
but we both know we can't do that.

08:01.471 --> 08:03.772
Yeah, you're probably right.

08:03.807 --> 08:06.275
Little John is a bit of a gossip.

08:06.310 --> 08:08.277
[Both chuckle]

08:08.312 --> 08:10.279
There it is.

08:10.314 --> 08:13.048
There's that elusive but satisfying smile

08:13.082 --> 08:15.851
I think about every time I close my eyes.

08:22.959 --> 08:25.761
This makes me wonder why

08:25.795 --> 08:27.729
we didn't do this a few decades ago.

08:27.764 --> 08:29.730
[Sighs]

08:29.765 --> 08:32.600
I think you were suffering
from a bit of heartbreak

08:32.634 --> 08:34.436
and a touch of self-loathing.

08:34.470 --> 08:39.073
And I was just some drunk
in a bar with a tattoo.

08:39.107 --> 08:44.446
Who tinker bell said I
was destined to be with.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.782
I should have listened
to that stupid fairy.

08:47.816 --> 08:49.784
Things might have turned out differently

08:49.818 --> 08:52.954
had I chosen you over...

08:52.988 --> 08:55.790
well, instead of...

08:55.824 --> 08:57.992
- Evil.
- Hmm.

08:58.026 --> 09:00.160
You made mistakes.

09:00.195 --> 09:02.562
And now you're making up for them.

09:04.599 --> 09:07.767
Or digging myself in deeper.

09:09.537 --> 09:11.838
You're married.

09:11.873 --> 09:13.340
I know.

09:13.375 --> 09:15.842
[Sighs]

09:15.877 --> 09:18.345
Even if there wasn't
a Marian [Chuckles]

09:18.380 --> 09:20.814
I'm certain this would end badly.

09:20.848 --> 09:24.150
Are you really that
much of a pessimist?

09:24.184 --> 09:28.655
Well, you would be, too, if
you knew everything I did.

09:28.689 --> 09:30.857
[Sighs]

09:36.030 --> 09:38.331
Have you seen this before?

09:38.365 --> 09:39.732
No.

09:39.766 --> 09:42.868
It's a magical storybook,
which we're all written into.

09:42.903 --> 09:45.505
And there's me,

09:45.539 --> 09:48.508
walking away from you at the bar.

09:48.542 --> 09:51.511
Where did this come from?

09:51.545 --> 09:53.512
I don't know.

09:53.547 --> 09:57.282
It just appeared when Henry needed it most,

09:57.316 --> 10:01.620
full of stories about
heroes and villains.

10:01.655 --> 10:04.690
Guess which column I'm in.

10:04.724 --> 10:08.027
This book is about the past.

10:08.061 --> 10:11.029
Like you said, you're not
the evil queen anymore.

10:11.064 --> 10:13.031
[Scoffs, chuckles]

10:13.066 --> 10:14.499
Tell that to the author

10:14.534 --> 10:17.669
because he seems to have made it a rule

10:17.703 --> 10:19.337
that villains don't get happy endings,

10:19.372 --> 10:23.308
even if they change,
even if they try to be good.

10:23.342 --> 10:24.642
Point him to me.

10:24.677 --> 10:27.045
I'll be happy to have
more than a conversation.

10:27.079 --> 10:28.546
[Scoffs]

10:28.581 --> 10:31.049
I wish it were that simple,

10:31.083 --> 10:35.186
but I don't know where he is or who he is

10:35.220 --> 10:39.323
or if it's a he or a she or an it.

10:39.357 --> 10:42.826
I've searched everywhere,
and I've been failing.

10:42.860 --> 10:44.995
Regina, let me help.

10:45.029 --> 10:46.997
[Sighs]

10:47.031 --> 10:48.699
You can't.

10:50.969 --> 10:52.936
And this...

10:52.971 --> 10:55.772
Cannot happen a second time.

10:55.807 --> 10:57.608
You understand?

10:57.642 --> 11:02.145
I know.

11:04.482 --> 11:06.449
But...

11:06.484 --> 11:09.285
If we don't leave this room,

11:09.320 --> 11:12.623
then I think that this still...

11:12.657 --> 11:15.825
this counts as the first time, doesn't it?

11:23.334 --> 11:24.834
[Laughs]

11:27.204 --> 11:29.372
[Sighs]

11:31.808 --> 11:34.276
You'd think a big
yellow driving machine

11:34.310 --> 11:36.278
would be easier to find.

11:36.312 --> 11:38.614
Perhaps she doesn't want to be found,

11:38.649 --> 11:40.670
since, you know, that's
what she bloody told us.

11:40.771 --> 11:41.808
Well, the good news is

11:41.808 --> 11:44.147
thanks to the ice wall,
Emma can't leave town.

11:44.147 --> 11:46.756
The longer she isolates
herself, the worse it'll get.

11:46.790 --> 11:49.424
Her magic will just keep spiraling.

11:49.459 --> 11:52.350
Elsa's right. This was a
bad idea coming home.

11:52.350 --> 11:53.828
We should still be out there searching.

11:53.863 --> 11:55.597
Hey, this isn't your fault.

11:55.632 --> 11:56.787
It isn't.

11:56.787 --> 11:59.119
We'll find Emma, but we've
been searching all night.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.002
Everyone's exhausted, yourself included.

12:01.037 --> 12:03.172
So we refuel, we regroup.

12:03.206 --> 12:06.340
And we go out, and we
find our daughter, okay?

12:06.375 --> 12:08.176
Okay.

12:08.210 --> 12:09.410
[Door opens]

12:09.444 --> 12:11.746
Henry: You don't have to look anymore.

12:11.781 --> 12:14.015
Henry. We thought you were asleep upstairs.

12:14.050 --> 12:16.184
We told you to stay here. What happened?

12:16.218 --> 12:18.953
I snuck out, okay?
I'm sorry, but I found her.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.822
How is she? Is she okay? Is she hurt?

12:21.856 --> 12:22.823
She's out in the woods.

12:22.857 --> 12:24.358
I thought I could help calm her down,

12:24.393 --> 12:26.194
but when I showed up, it
just made things worse.

12:26.228 --> 12:29.697
Come with me. I'll clean
you up in the bathroom.

12:29.731 --> 12:31.265
This is bad news.

12:31.300 --> 12:34.635
If anyone can calm her down, it's Henry.

12:36.738 --> 12:38.205
When your powers are out of control,

12:38.239 --> 12:39.873
everything's upside down.

12:39.908 --> 12:42.375
You don't want to be anywhere
near the people you care about.

12:42.410 --> 12:44.712
Wonderful. Well, shall we
send Sneezy after her, then?

12:44.746 --> 12:47.547
Or happy? Which is
the dwarf she despises?

12:47.582 --> 12:50.217
I was so scared that I would hurt Ana

12:50.251 --> 12:52.886
until I finally realized you can't run away

12:52.921 --> 12:55.388
from the people who love
you because, in the end,

12:55.423 --> 12:58.124
they're the only ones who can help you.

12:58.158 --> 13:01.794
Hurry, I want everything
ready before Ana arrives.

13:01.829 --> 13:03.796
Uh, chocolate fondue goes there.

13:03.831 --> 13:06.633
Chocolate toast, chocolate julekake.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.535
And chocolate ice cream.

13:08.569 --> 13:11.403
Or is ice cream too obvious? Should
we lose the ice cream? [Door opens]

13:11.438 --> 13:13.372
Oh, Ana, don't come in yet. I
haven't got everything ready.

13:13.406 --> 13:16.709
I'm afraid Ana won't be at dinner tonight.

13:16.744 --> 13:18.377
Something quite terrible has happened.

13:18.411 --> 13:19.645
Could you leave please?

13:19.679 --> 13:23.315
It's all right. We'll finish later.

13:23.350 --> 13:25.084
What is it?

13:25.119 --> 13:26.752
This will be hard to understand, but Ana,

13:26.786 --> 13:28.387
she hasn't been entirely honest with you.

13:28.421 --> 13:31.089
She didn't come back from
Misthaven empty-handed.

13:31.124 --> 13:33.825
She found the thing your
parents were looking for.

13:33.860 --> 13:35.160
Which was...?

13:35.194 --> 13:37.496
A magical hat to take away your powers,

13:37.530 --> 13:40.031
to cure you of the very
thing that makes you special.

13:40.066 --> 13:44.535
So that's why they left on that boat.

13:44.570 --> 13:47.372
But why would Ana hide that from me?

13:47.406 --> 13:50.208
Because your dear sister was
planning to use it on you.

13:50.243 --> 13:53.211
No, she would never.
She tried it on me first.

13:53.246 --> 13:55.881
Fortunately, I stopped her.

13:55.915 --> 13:58.549
She's in the dungeon,
awaiting your royal judgment.

13:58.584 --> 14:02.052
Oh, there must be some misunderstanding.
She called me a monster.

14:02.087 --> 14:04.722
I'm afraid she was very clear

14:04.757 --> 14:06.624
on her feelings about our powers.

14:06.659 --> 14:09.960
She's my sister.

14:09.995 --> 14:12.129
She's always supported me.

14:12.164 --> 14:16.100
I felt that way about my sister,

14:16.134 --> 14:17.268
your mother,

14:17.302 --> 14:19.403
before she dropped me in that urn.

14:19.437 --> 14:22.673
My mother put you in there?

14:25.010 --> 14:26.310
Why have you never told me this?

14:26.344 --> 14:28.813
You had such beautiful memories.

14:28.847 --> 14:30.815
I didn't want to destroy them.

14:30.849 --> 14:33.883
And I was hoping that
Ana would be different.

14:33.918 --> 14:37.287
But she is exactly like your mother.

14:37.322 --> 14:39.222
She will never accept who you are.

14:44.261 --> 14:46.563
I'm so sorry.

14:46.597 --> 14:50.733
I-I felt that you deserved the truth.

14:50.767 --> 14:52.735
Are you okay?

14:52.769 --> 14:56.072
I'd actually like to be
left alone, if that's okay.

14:56.106 --> 14:58.407
Of course.

14:58.442 --> 15:02.378
I'll be near, if you need me.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.301
If you're trying to hide from me, Ms. Swan,

16:00.335 --> 16:02.136
you're doing a poor job.

16:02.170 --> 16:05.773
I'm not hiding from you. I'm
hiding from everyone else.

16:08.076 --> 16:09.710
Ah.

16:09.744 --> 16:11.545
So Belle tells me.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.881
She was watching Neal all night.

16:13.915 --> 16:16.216
While my family was
searching for me, I know.

16:16.250 --> 16:18.685
My magic is hurting people,
gold... people I love.

16:18.720 --> 16:20.421
I need you to help me control it.

16:20.455 --> 16:22.890
What makes you think I'm your best option?

16:22.924 --> 16:25.726
Because I...

16:25.760 --> 16:27.469
Hurt Henry.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.004
What?

16:31.010 --> 16:32.695
I... he's okay, but it was just luck.

16:32.695 --> 16:33.986
You're probably the only person

16:33.986 --> 16:35.356
who's safe around me right now.

16:35.356 --> 16:37.404
I need you to help
before I hurt anybody else.

16:37.438 --> 16:42.442
There's only one way to
help with this affliction.

16:42.476 --> 16:43.635
Well, just fine. Do it.

16:43.635 --> 16:45.945
- You haven't heard what I have to say.
- I don't care.

16:45.979 --> 16:48.314
My son is in pain because
of me. Just fix it.

16:50.417 --> 16:53.719
This...

16:53.754 --> 16:56.556
This is an ancient spell.

16:56.590 --> 16:58.691
It's designed to take away light magic

16:58.725 --> 17:01.293
from those who choose to part with it,

17:01.328 --> 17:03.762
but the effect would be permanent.

17:03.796 --> 17:07.266
- So I'd lose all my magic. I'd be...
- Ordinary.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.601
But...

17:09.635 --> 17:12.972
Your magic would no longer
hurt the ones you love,

17:13.006 --> 17:15.540
and you would be able
to embrace your son.

17:15.575 --> 17:17.376
[Gasps]

17:17.410 --> 17:19.978
Do it.

17:20.012 --> 17:23.982
Well, unfortunately, savior
magic doesn't go quietly.

17:24.016 --> 17:27.151
Though the spell won't
hurt you, it will destroy

17:27.185 --> 17:29.387
almost everything else within a city block.

17:29.421 --> 17:31.890
That would make for quite
a macabre sight at grannies,

17:31.924 --> 17:33.057
don't you think?

17:33.092 --> 17:34.993
So let's find somewhere
else out in the woods.

17:35.027 --> 17:37.328
As you wish.

17:37.363 --> 17:39.998
I think I know...

17:40.032 --> 17:41.866
Just the spot.

17:44.336 --> 17:46.971
Here...

17:47.006 --> 17:48.806
Is an abandoned manor.

17:48.840 --> 17:50.808
Right here.

17:50.842 --> 17:52.342
You meet me here at sundown.

17:52.377 --> 17:54.478
And I'll have everything prepared.

17:54.513 --> 17:55.813
Thanks, gold.

17:55.847 --> 17:57.748
Please don't tell anyone I was here.

17:57.782 --> 18:01.752
Don't worry about me, dearie.

18:01.786 --> 18:03.854
It'll be our little secret.

18:03.889 --> 18:07.057
[Sighs]

[Door bell jingles]

18:10.228 --> 18:13.163
[Door closes]

18:38.802 --> 18:40.930
I need to see my sister, Ana, immediately.

18:46.576 --> 18:48.043
Elsa!

18:48.078 --> 18:50.512
I thought you'd never find me.

18:50.546 --> 18:53.849
Our aunt Ingrid...
she locked me in here.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.085
Because you tried to attack her.

18:56.119 --> 18:58.753
No, Elsa, you can't
believe anything she says.

18:58.788 --> 18:59.847
She lied about her past.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.157
- She's lying about me.
- Is she?

19:02.158 --> 19:04.926
Did you learn what our parents
were after and then hide it?

19:04.961 --> 19:06.595
I was waiting for the right moment.

19:06.629 --> 19:10.198
So you lied and kept this magical object,

19:10.232 --> 19:12.734
this hat, which could
strip me of all my powers.

19:12.768 --> 19:14.736
Yes, but I would never hurt you.

19:14.770 --> 19:16.204
Enough!

19:16.238 --> 19:19.040
Leave me alone to speak with my sister...

19:19.074 --> 19:20.574
Now.

19:23.112 --> 19:25.079
Please.

19:25.114 --> 19:27.215
You have to believe me.

19:30.486 --> 19:32.786
- [Door closes]
- Of course I believe you.

19:32.821 --> 19:34.455
I'm so sorry about all that, Ana.

19:34.490 --> 19:37.525
Wait. This was all a ruse?

19:39.127 --> 19:40.594
It was a ruse!

19:48.136 --> 19:49.436
Ohh.

19:49.470 --> 19:51.438
I needed the guards to
think I sided with Ingrid.

19:51.472 --> 19:53.440
I'm so sorry. Don't apologize.

19:53.474 --> 19:55.108
- You were fantastic.
- [Chuckles]

19:55.143 --> 19:57.444
I believed every word.
I was absolutely crushed.

19:59.813 --> 20:03.116
Here. I got this back from the jailer.

20:03.151 --> 20:04.984
Thank you.

20:07.888 --> 20:10.523
When they took this, it...

20:10.558 --> 20:12.959
it was like they were taking you.

20:12.993 --> 20:16.696
I'm never going to take this off again.

20:16.730 --> 20:18.898
Well, hopefully, you'll
never end up in prison again.

20:18.933 --> 20:19.999
Oh, speaking of which,

20:20.034 --> 20:21.634
I'm really worried about Ingrid right now.

20:21.669 --> 20:26.205
She's scary and powerful
and smart and scary.

20:26.239 --> 20:27.506
You already said scary.

20:27.541 --> 20:29.108
So I'm really hoping you have a plan.

20:29.142 --> 20:30.842
I have a plan...
well, half a plan.

20:30.877 --> 20:32.611
We're going to sneak you out of here

20:32.645 --> 20:34.613
and then steal back the urn...

20:34.647 --> 20:36.115
And then trap her inside it.

20:36.149 --> 20:39.185
That sounds like a whole plan.

20:39.219 --> 20:41.853
However, I don't know
where she hides the urn,

20:41.888 --> 20:44.355
and we live in a very, very large castle.

20:44.390 --> 20:45.523
Don't worry about that part.

20:45.558 --> 20:46.992
I grew up running around this castle.

20:47.026 --> 20:49.661
I know every nook and cranny.

21:00.106 --> 21:02.039
How is he?

21:02.074 --> 21:04.809
I gave him enough ice for the week.

21:04.843 --> 21:07.412
It should help with the swelling.

21:07.446 --> 21:09.247
No. How is he?

21:09.281 --> 21:11.483
Upset.

21:11.517 --> 21:14.319
I just wanted him to understand

21:14.353 --> 21:17.854
Emma's magic is tied to
her emotions, like mine.

21:17.888 --> 21:19.188
The reason she hurt him is

21:19.223 --> 21:22.025
because she was trying
so hard not to hurt him.

21:22.059 --> 21:24.861
It sounds very convoluted
when I try to explain it now.

21:24.895 --> 21:26.896
No, no. Um...

21:26.931 --> 21:28.665
It makes perfect sense.

21:28.699 --> 21:31.200
Where's Henry? Is he okay?

21:31.235 --> 21:33.536
He's fine. He's upstairs. We've
been trying to call you all night.

21:33.570 --> 21:36.539
Well, I'm sorry if I don't
respond to your every summons!

21:36.573 --> 21:39.609
Though I did bring that
locator potion you wanted.

21:39.643 --> 21:42.612
Maybe next time, try
leading with, "thank you."

21:42.646 --> 21:45.348
Now, may I see my son, please?

21:45.382 --> 21:47.583
You might want to finish
buttoning your shirt first.

21:47.618 --> 21:51.453
Oh. Well, I was in a rush to get here.

21:51.487 --> 21:55.024
A locator potion. How
does this work, exactly?

21:55.058 --> 21:56.525
We just pour it over anything

21:56.559 --> 21:58.894
that belonged to Emma... something...

22:00.396 --> 22:03.365
Something like this.

22:03.399 --> 22:04.967
[Cellphone ringing]

22:05.001 --> 22:06.535
[Gasps] It's her.

22:07.270 --> 22:10.572
Hey, mom. It's me. Did Henry come home?

22:10.606 --> 22:13.708
Oh, yes, yes. No, he's fine.

22:13.742 --> 22:16.144
Emma, I am so sorry about
what happened yesterday.

22:16.179 --> 22:19.548
I don't want you to ever think
that we are afraid of you.

22:19.582 --> 22:21.616
Don't worry. It doesn't matter.

22:21.651 --> 22:22.784
No, of course it matters.

22:22.818 --> 22:24.318
This is all gonna be over soon.

22:24.352 --> 22:25.987
I just needed to tell you that I'm okay.

22:26.021 --> 22:28.289
I-I have a way to fix everything.

22:33.796 --> 22:36.263
Emma, no, wait.

22:36.298 --> 22:38.432
[Beep]

22:38.466 --> 22:40.901
What did she say?

22:40.935 --> 22:43.737
She said she's going to
get rid of her magic...

22:43.771 --> 22:44.871
Forever.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.475
How is that even possible?

22:48.510 --> 22:49.743
She said it will all be over soon,

22:49.777 --> 22:52.446
and she can't wait to be home
for a cocoa with cinnamon.

22:52.480 --> 22:55.282
Hook: Did she say
anything about the method?

22:55.317 --> 22:59.686
If it was a spell or... a
magic object of some kind?

22:59.721 --> 23:01.521
Who cares how she's doing it?
That's not what matters here.

23:01.555 --> 23:04.858
No, you're absolutely right.

23:04.892 --> 23:07.293
I wonder if she tried to call me.

23:07.328 --> 23:08.628
Bloody hell.

23:08.662 --> 23:11.798
I left my talking phone
in the back of your truck.

23:11.833 --> 23:13.366
It's just called a phone.

23:13.400 --> 23:17.837
What an impractical name.
I'll be back in two shakes.

23:17.871 --> 23:19.472
[Door closes]

23:23.677 --> 23:26.646
[Beep]

23:26.680 --> 23:27.947
Emma, it's Killian.

23:27.981 --> 23:30.783
Call me right away, or
you may never make it home

23:30.817 --> 23:34.453
for cinnamon and cocoa... Ever.

23:34.487 --> 23:37.123
[Beep] Damn it, Swan.

23:37.157 --> 23:38.758
Don't tell me you trusted The Crocodile.

23:46.088 --> 23:47.473
[Kristoff coughing]

23:47.880 --> 23:49.514
It's dusty in here.

23:49.548 --> 23:51.516
I'm surprised it bothers you.

23:51.550 --> 23:53.551
Hey, I may have slept in a barn,

23:53.585 --> 23:55.153
but it was a spotless barn.

23:55.187 --> 23:57.155
[Chuckles]

23:57.189 --> 23:59.024
I've never been in this part of the palace.

24:00.888 --> 24:02.871
What makes you think
Ingrid hid the urn here?

24:03.903 --> 24:07.038
Mother and father told me
not to go in the east wing

24:07.073 --> 24:09.708
because it was crumbling and dangerous.

24:09.742 --> 24:11.510
So, of course, I had to.

24:11.544 --> 24:13.212
Naturally.

24:13.246 --> 24:14.787
But it didn't seem dangerous to me.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.082
Just... forgotten.

24:19.343 --> 24:21.476
Mother probably wanted to forget

24:21.511 --> 24:23.979
the painful memories of her sister.

24:24.014 --> 24:26.314
You royals sure go to exhaustive lengths

24:26.349 --> 24:28.117
to ignore your issues.

24:28.151 --> 24:29.351
You're still here?

24:29.385 --> 24:31.754
You're supposed to be
outside keeping watch.

24:31.788 --> 24:33.588
And, remember, if you see
Ingrid, use the secret signal.

24:33.623 --> 24:35.824
Wait, do we have a secret signal?

24:35.859 --> 24:38.826
Uh, I think "run" will work just fine.

24:38.861 --> 24:42.130
- [Sighs]
- [Door closes]

24:51.740 --> 24:54.876
What is it, Elsa? Is everything all right?

24:54.910 --> 24:58.046
Yeah, I was just thinking about
what it must have been like

24:58.080 --> 25:00.048
when mother and Ingrid were younger.

25:00.082 --> 25:01.515
I wonder what happened

25:01.550 --> 25:04.152
that made them turn against each other.

25:04.186 --> 25:07.689
Knowing Ingrid, I'm not
surprised things got ugly.

25:09.224 --> 25:11.525
You don't need to worry.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.527
It's in the past.

25:13.562 --> 25:16.730
And you and I both know
that can never happen to us.

25:16.764 --> 25:20.734
Now... We need to get searching.

25:20.768 --> 25:22.536
[Sighs]

25:27.274 --> 25:28.975
We need to find that urn.

25:29.010 --> 25:31.011
[Gasps] Hans!

25:31.045 --> 25:33.847
Look, he's... he's...

25:33.881 --> 25:36.016
He's frozen.

25:36.050 --> 25:37.984
I guess I forgot to tell you

25:38.019 --> 25:41.154
everything that happened
since you were away.

25:41.189 --> 25:43.155
Ingrid did this?

25:43.190 --> 25:44.490
To be fair, it's the one good thing

25:44.525 --> 25:47.159
she's done since
getting out of that urn.

25:47.194 --> 25:50.697
And look, there it is.

25:57.338 --> 26:00.472
It's smaller than I imagined.

26:00.506 --> 26:03.475
It must not have been very comfortable.

26:03.509 --> 26:06.145
Well, she's going to have to make do

26:06.179 --> 26:09.481
because she's going right back inside it.

26:19.425 --> 26:21.893
Did you come here for a reason?

26:21.927 --> 26:25.897
As I recall, I already
told you what you need to do

26:25.931 --> 26:28.400
to free yourself from your dagger.

26:28.434 --> 26:29.868
Hmm.

26:29.902 --> 26:33.704
I have nothing more to give you...

26:33.739 --> 26:36.074
Unless...

26:38.410 --> 26:41.079
you simply like watching me.

26:43.382 --> 26:46.684
I never do anything without a good reason.

26:46.718 --> 26:51.355
And watching your twisted
mind at work does not qualify.

26:51.390 --> 26:53.357
Twisted?

26:53.392 --> 26:56.694
Says the man who betrayed
everyone in Storybrooke.

26:56.728 --> 26:59.363
I haven't betrayed a single person.

26:59.398 --> 27:01.332
Not yet, anyway.

27:01.366 --> 27:05.102
Did you forget that you gave me those?

27:05.136 --> 27:06.970
Did you forget what they can do?

27:07.005 --> 27:08.772
I don't forget much, dearie.

27:08.807 --> 27:12.609
But if you plan to put
that ribbon on Emma Swan,

27:12.643 --> 27:15.478
you're about to be disappointed.

27:15.513 --> 27:18.148
With her powers out of control,

27:18.183 --> 27:21.984
I've now found my own use for her.

27:22.019 --> 27:24.788
You think you can take
her away from me now?

27:24.822 --> 27:26.456
[Whoosh]

27:26.490 --> 27:29.158
[Gasping]

27:31.061 --> 27:32.261
What did you do?

27:32.296 --> 27:33.330
Look down.

27:39.469 --> 27:42.538
Remember the urn
your sister placed you in?

27:42.572 --> 27:45.541
It had the power to limit your magic.

27:45.575 --> 27:48.344
Elsa destroyed that urn.

27:48.378 --> 27:49.846
Well, funny thing about magic...

27:49.880 --> 27:52.181
it can never be destroyed completely.

27:52.216 --> 27:55.517
It simply lives on in other forms.

27:55.552 --> 27:59.120
Magic survives.

27:59.155 --> 28:02.458
I visited the barn where
the urn was destroyed,

28:02.492 --> 28:06.328
collected its remnants
grain by grain...

28:06.363 --> 28:08.897
painstaking process.

28:08.931 --> 28:13.201
And I must say... the effort paid off.

28:16.839 --> 28:20.207
When I escape,

28:20.242 --> 28:23.878
there will be a terrible price to pay.

28:23.912 --> 28:25.712
Don't worry.

28:25.747 --> 28:28.382
The dust won't last long,

28:28.416 --> 28:31.051
just long enough to get what I want.

28:31.086 --> 28:32.719
And, uh, you see,

28:32.754 --> 28:36.089
I don't have to betray
everyone in Storybrooke.

28:36.123 --> 28:38.358
Just you.

28:38.393 --> 28:41.528
And, I'm afraid...

28:41.562 --> 28:44.163
Emma Swan.

29:33.731 --> 29:35.500
Hands off. That's me lunch and dinner.

29:35.937 --> 29:38.738
Sorry, friend, but I
need to pick your brain.

29:38.773 --> 29:39.873
And I need you sober

29:39.907 --> 29:42.076
as friar Tuck on a Sunday when I do it.

29:42.110 --> 29:45.112
I'm not sure Sunday's ever made
any difference for that man.

29:45.146 --> 29:47.081
What's happening?

29:47.115 --> 29:49.115
Regina needs our help.

29:55.590 --> 29:57.491
- This book.
- Funny.

29:57.525 --> 29:59.593
You were never much
the reading sort, Robin.

29:59.627 --> 30:01.928
It's not mine. I stole it.

30:01.963 --> 30:04.097
Ah, well, that sounds more like you.

30:04.131 --> 30:06.399
So, what's so important about a book?

30:06.433 --> 30:10.069
Whoever wrote this imbued
it with magical powers...

30:10.104 --> 30:12.571
powers that could change
Regina's future for the better.

30:12.606 --> 30:15.641
We need to figure out who did this.

30:15.675 --> 30:20.646
Information about the
writer of a magical book.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.648
[Sucks lips]

30:22.682 --> 30:24.416
I might just have an idea.

30:24.450 --> 30:26.685
Excellent.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.587
But I'm gonna need me
lunch and dinner back.

30:31.825 --> 30:34.459
See, you ain't been in
this town as long as I have.

30:34.494 --> 30:37.129
There wasn't always
magic, but when it came,

30:37.163 --> 30:40.765
it started at one place...
the Clock Tower.

30:40.799 --> 30:43.835
See, for 28 years, them hands didn't move.

30:43.869 --> 30:46.171
Time stood still.

30:46.205 --> 30:48.840
Then one day, tick-tock, it bloody did.

30:48.874 --> 30:50.175
I'm afraid you've lost me, will.

30:50.209 --> 30:51.976
I understand the significance
of the magical clock,

30:52.011 --> 30:53.978
but what's that got to do
with this book or its author?

30:54.013 --> 30:55.813
Do you know what's under
that magical clock tower?

30:55.848 --> 30:57.682
No.

30:57.716 --> 30:58.850
A library.

31:13.598 --> 31:15.599
[David sighs]

31:19.938 --> 31:21.572
Hmm.

31:21.606 --> 31:24.075
I've always liked that picture.

31:24.109 --> 31:25.876
Emma has your eyes.

31:25.910 --> 31:27.243
She has your smile.

31:27.278 --> 31:29.646
Do you remember when you
took it? How could I forget?

31:29.681 --> 31:30.981
That was the party we had at granny's

31:31.015 --> 31:32.849
after Emma helped us go up against...

31:32.884 --> 31:34.484
Pan or Anton the giant?

31:34.518 --> 31:37.854
- Try Cora.
- Oh.

31:37.889 --> 31:39.489
We invited happy to that?

31:39.523 --> 31:41.191
I guess it's easy to lose track.

31:41.225 --> 31:43.526
She has saved Storybrooke a lot.

31:43.561 --> 31:44.694
Mm-hmm.

31:44.728 --> 31:48.398
I'm worried about her, too,

31:48.432 --> 31:50.166
but Emma is tough.

31:50.201 --> 31:52.835
She'll be fine.

31:52.869 --> 31:56.172
What if she's making a mistake?

31:56.207 --> 31:59.008
Because of us...
shouldn't we be out there

31:59.042 --> 32:01.510
<i>trying to convince her
not to give up her magic?</i>

32:01.544 --> 32:04.179
Well, it's her choice, not ours.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.115
She knows we support her, no matter what,

32:06.149 --> 32:08.084
and if losing her magic is what she wants,

32:08.118 --> 32:11.921
well... maybe it's not such a bad thing.

32:11.955 --> 32:15.390
But it's part of who
she is... a savior.

32:15.425 --> 32:17.159
I mean, she was born
this way... a hero.

32:17.193 --> 32:18.960
So isn't embracing that the right thing?

32:18.995 --> 32:21.296
Well, if the Snow Queen is doing all this

32:21.331 --> 32:24.633
because of Emma's power, maybe...

32:24.667 --> 32:27.969
Getting rid of it is the heroic thing.

32:28.004 --> 32:31.640
Do you remember the night Emma was born?

32:31.674 --> 32:34.142
Before we put her in the wardrobe,

32:34.176 --> 32:36.410
you said we had to
give her her best chance.

32:36.445 --> 32:41.783
Maybe now her best
chance is for her to be...

32:43.953 --> 32:47.689
Normal.

32:57.266 --> 32:58.566
Anna: We can't let anyone see us.

32:58.600 --> 33:01.302
Ingrid could have eyes
and ears everywhere.

33:01.336 --> 33:04.772
Of course, not literally.
That would be gross.

33:04.806 --> 33:07.307
- [Chuckles] And unhygienic.
- [Floorboard creaks]

33:09.310 --> 33:11.311
Though she does have
skeletons in her closet.

33:11.345 --> 33:13.313
Because we did just
find Hans in her closet.

33:13.347 --> 33:15.049
And his body does contain a skeleton.

33:15.083 --> 33:17.084
- [Scoffs]
- [Door opens]

33:18.687 --> 33:21.121
[Indistinct conversation]

33:24.392 --> 33:26.059
Aah.

33:35.185 --> 33:36.215
[Door closes]

33:36.215 --> 33:38.915
Okay, that was a close one. Let's go.

33:42.776 --> 33:45.578
You're not going.

33:45.612 --> 33:46.946
Elsa.

33:48.882 --> 33:50.850
Is what Ingrid said true?

33:50.884 --> 33:52.585
That our parents went to Misthaven

33:52.619 --> 33:54.587
to find something to take away my magic?

33:58.925 --> 34:00.392
It is.

34:00.427 --> 34:02.994
Sorry, Elsa, I should have told you

34:03.029 --> 34:04.496
the second I got back home.

34:04.531 --> 34:08.300
I just... I didn't know how.

34:09.869 --> 34:11.503
I don't blame them.

34:11.538 --> 34:13.670
When people look at this painting,

34:13.706 --> 34:17.342
they see a king and a queen.

34:17.376 --> 34:20.812
But the only thing I see is mama and papa.

34:20.847 --> 34:23.614
They were only human. They made mistakes.

34:26.085 --> 34:27.552
If they could see you today,

34:27.585 --> 34:30.588
I bet they would never ask you
to give up a part of yourself.

34:33.058 --> 34:35.859
But they're not here.

34:35.893 --> 34:38.495
And we'll never know.

34:38.529 --> 34:40.163
What matters

34:40.197 --> 34:44.333
is that your powers make you special.

34:44.369 --> 34:47.137
And I wouldn't want you any other way.

35:09.717 --> 35:11.684
Will: I've tried this one before.

35:12.723 --> 35:14.906
Probably easier when I'm not
drunk and getting punched.

35:17.662 --> 35:19.977
It's a pin tumbler with six pins.

35:20.186 --> 35:21.219
Not the easiest.

35:22.092 --> 35:25.894
With a bit of luck and a light touch,

35:25.928 --> 35:27.896
the old will Scarlet...

35:31.867 --> 35:34.896
"Opening hours till 10:00."

35:35.303 --> 35:36.436
Very generous.

35:36.470 --> 35:37.804
Indeed.

35:43.110 --> 35:46.445
[Sighs]

35:48.481 --> 35:50.283
I can keep sitting here

35:50.317 --> 35:51.951
pretending to read about Wolverine,

35:51.985 --> 35:55.987
or you can talk about
what happened with Emma.

35:56.022 --> 35:57.556
Nothing to talk about.

36:00.627 --> 36:03.094
Can I at least look at the wound?

36:03.129 --> 36:06.932
Not that I don't trust
the ice doctor's diagnosis.

36:06.966 --> 36:09.134
Okay, fine.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.541
- [Grunts]
- [Gasps]

36:16.575 --> 36:18.210
Does that hurt?

36:18.244 --> 36:20.445
A little.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.985
Not anymore.

36:27.019 --> 36:29.987
All better.

36:33.892 --> 36:37.862
It must be nice to have
magic and be useful.

36:37.896 --> 36:40.498
What's that supposed to mean?

36:40.532 --> 36:43.000
I went out there to help her,

36:43.034 --> 36:46.503
but I couldn't do anything
because I'm just...

36:46.537 --> 36:47.738
Ordinary.

36:47.772 --> 36:50.707
Henry.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.843
[Sighs]

36:54.379 --> 36:57.681
We are each given our own gifts.

36:57.715 --> 37:01.018
You have the heart of the truest believer.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.552
You brought us all together.

37:02.587 --> 37:05.054
Never think you're ordinary

37:05.089 --> 37:06.857
just because you don't have magic...

37:06.891 --> 37:10.360
Or claws or...

37:10.395 --> 37:11.695
[Chuckles]

37:11.729 --> 37:15.031
Ripped purple shorts.

37:16.967 --> 37:19.602
Now, don't worry about Emma.

37:19.636 --> 37:23.940
She's a hero, and, as we both know...

37:23.974 --> 37:26.242
Both: Heroes always win.

37:31.148 --> 37:33.917
Crocodile?!

37:33.951 --> 37:36.285
- Where are you?!
- [Door bell jingles]

37:39.122 --> 37:42.792
Emma. No.

37:42.826 --> 37:45.461
No, no, no.

37:45.495 --> 37:48.196
[Cellphone dialing]

37:48.231 --> 37:50.533
Swan, it's Killian again.

37:50.567 --> 37:52.534
You have to listen to me.

37:52.568 --> 37:54.202
I know that you've been to see gold.

37:54.237 --> 37:55.870
I saw what you did.

37:55.905 --> 37:58.873
And if he's promised to
get rid of your powers,

37:58.908 --> 38:00.042
don't listen to him.

38:00.076 --> 38:01.243
He doesn't want to help you.

38:01.277 --> 38:02.911
He wants... he wants
to collect your powers

38:02.946 --> 38:03.979
in a bloody magic hat.

38:04.013 --> 38:06.148
And when he does, you'll be sucked in, too.

38:06.182 --> 38:07.816
I-I don't know what he's planning,

38:07.850 --> 38:09.984
but I know that he's been lying to Belle.

38:10.018 --> 38:13.488
The dagger he gave her is a fake.

38:13.522 --> 38:15.723
I only know all this because...

38:18.427 --> 38:21.395
because I'm afraid I've
been lying to you, too.

38:21.430 --> 38:23.731
Gold blackmailed me into helping him.

38:23.766 --> 38:26.233
He knew.

38:26.268 --> 38:29.736
He knew I'd do whatever
it takes to be with you,

38:29.771 --> 38:31.839
and he used it against me.

38:31.873 --> 38:35.176
I just wanted to be

38:35.210 --> 38:38.179
a better man for you, Swan.

38:38.213 --> 38:40.848
But I failed.

38:40.882 --> 38:45.018
And now because of it, I might lose you.

38:45.052 --> 38:48.221
I'm sorry.

38:49.724 --> 38:52.025
But I hope you never
forgive me because that means

38:52.059 --> 38:54.728
that you'll get this in
time to save yourself.

38:56.898 --> 38:58.698

40:55.445 --> 40:56.545
Smart.

40:56.580 --> 41:00.516
Now, are you sure you're
gonna be okay down here?

41:00.550 --> 41:02.719
Yes, it's not as bad as it looks,

41:02.753 --> 41:04.654
except for the dankness and
the darkness and the mice...

41:04.688 --> 41:06.990
Who are cute, when they're
not scurrying over your toes.

41:07.024 --> 41:08.992
But I have shoes.

41:09.026 --> 41:10.359
I promise, I'll be fine.

41:10.393 --> 41:11.994
And I promise I won't be long.

41:12.028 --> 41:13.795
As soon as I return to the palace,

41:13.830 --> 41:15.763
I'll tell Ingrid you're to be banished

41:15.797 --> 41:18.299
and that she's to see to
your punishment personally.

41:18.334 --> 41:20.801
Then when she comes down here,
I'll surprise her with the urn.

41:20.836 --> 41:22.803
Not like a party... "surprise!"

41:22.838 --> 41:27.242
Something more dour to match
the occasion, like, "surprise."

41:27.276 --> 41:29.577
What if something goes wrong?

41:29.612 --> 41:31.479
I should come down here, too, just in case.

41:31.514 --> 41:33.313
No, you need to be as far away as possible.

41:33.348 --> 41:36.583
We don't want you getting
trapped in the urn by mistake.

41:36.618 --> 41:37.918
Please don't worry.

41:37.953 --> 41:40.921
I promise... everything
is going to be fine.

41:40.956 --> 41:42.623
[Exhales sharply]

41:53.901 --> 41:56.002
[Lock clicks]

42:17.457 --> 42:19.926
[Whoosh]

42:19.960 --> 42:21.427
[Gasps]

42:21.461 --> 42:23.862
[Breathing heavily]

42:33.440 --> 42:35.608
Surprise! [Chuckles]

42:35.642 --> 42:37.376
How was that?

42:37.411 --> 42:39.001
I'd have done it different.

42:39.208 --> 42:40.955
Well, I'm afraid you
won't get the chance.

42:40.955 --> 42:42.065
You see, I was hoping

42:42.065 --> 42:43.749
that Elsa would believe
the lies I told her,

42:43.783 --> 42:46.585
but I knew I had to be
ready in case she didn't.

42:46.619 --> 42:47.652
It doesn't matter.

42:47.687 --> 42:49.888
You'll never turn us against each other.

42:49.923 --> 42:54.626
"Never." That's a strong word.

42:58.664 --> 43:01.666
[Wind howling]

43:08.708 --> 43:10.575
- Snow Queen: Emma.
- [Gasps]

43:10.610 --> 43:11.776
Stay back.

43:11.810 --> 43:14.612
Wherever you're headed,
turn around and go home.

43:14.646 --> 43:16.447
You are in great danger.

43:16.481 --> 43:18.750
Gonna listen to you about
danger? Get out of my way.

43:18.784 --> 43:22.053
My sweet girl, I am not the
one that you should fear.

43:22.087 --> 43:23.354
Rumplestiltskin is.

43:23.388 --> 43:25.422
Whatever he's promised you, it's a lie.

43:25.457 --> 43:27.625
How do you know he promised me anything?

43:27.659 --> 43:29.793
So I was right.

43:29.827 --> 43:33.297
You mustn't trust him, Emma.

43:33.331 --> 43:35.466
He doesn't do anything
unless it benefits him.

43:35.500 --> 43:36.567
He doesn't care about you.

43:36.601 --> 43:37.968
He would kill you to get what he desires.

43:38.002 --> 43:39.803
You know what I think?

43:39.837 --> 43:41.972
The fact that you don't
want me to go means something.

43:42.006 --> 43:43.474
It means I'm going.

43:43.508 --> 43:46.143
I won't let you.

43:46.177 --> 43:49.312
You're not gonna hurt me. You need me.

43:49.346 --> 43:51.181
Don't do this.

43:51.215 --> 43:52.482
What the...?

43:53.550 --> 43:54.751
You're not here.

43:56.387 --> 43:58.989
If I could be, I would.

43:59.023 --> 44:02.224
I'm trying to protect
you, and that is the truth.

44:02.259 --> 44:03.993
I don't care what you
say. That's the truth.

44:33.177 --> 44:35.382
- How's Henry?
- [Sighs]

44:35.382 --> 44:37.349
Reading comic books. Refusing to sleep.

44:37.384 --> 44:39.184
So, I think okay.

44:40.391 --> 44:43.014
Or at least his version of a brave face.

44:44.847 --> 44:47.782
Thank you, by the way, for earlier.

44:47.816 --> 44:49.884
He has enough problems

44:49.918 --> 44:52.887
without bringing my
mess of a life into it.

44:52.921 --> 44:57.224
By "mess," do you mean Robin Hood?

44:57.259 --> 44:58.825
Did you guys, uh...

44:58.860 --> 45:00.227
[Scoffs]

45:00.262 --> 45:04.131
Oh, come on, Regina. You
don't need to be ashamed.

45:04.165 --> 45:09.135
Well, I know I don't
have to be, but... I am.

45:09.169 --> 45:11.070
Is everything okay?

45:11.105 --> 45:12.338
What are you doing here?

45:12.373 --> 45:15.241
Well, shouldn't someone
be out looking for Emma?

45:15.276 --> 45:17.744
Didn't Mary Margaret tell you? She called.

45:17.779 --> 45:19.913
She figured out a way
to get rid of her magic.

45:19.947 --> 45:23.010
Get rid of it? And you're okay with that?

45:23.010 --> 45:25.411
We support our daughter.

45:25.446 --> 45:29.014
We're not talking about an
old pair of Jimmy Choos here.

45:29.049 --> 45:31.817
Tell me you're joking.

45:31.852 --> 45:34.287
It may seem drastic, but it's the only way

45:34.321 --> 45:36.822
Emma can be sure never
to hurt anyone again.

45:36.857 --> 45:38.951
This could be the worst
idea you've ever had,

45:39.311 --> 45:42.294
and you hired the wicked
witch as your nanny.

45:42.328 --> 45:44.096
Well, we actually think
it'll be good for her.

45:44.131 --> 45:46.365
- We... she could be normal.
- [Sighs]

45:46.399 --> 45:50.202
Let me ask you something.

45:50.237 --> 45:52.805
Do you know what I regret most?

45:52.839 --> 45:54.339
Countless innocent lives you destroyed?

45:57.077 --> 46:01.713
That I didn't support Henry
when he realized he was special.

46:01.748 --> 46:04.716
You of all people should remember.

46:04.751 --> 46:06.117
'Cause you started it all

46:06.152 --> 46:08.253
when you gave him that storybook.

46:08.288 --> 46:10.522
It opened up a whole world for him.

46:12.694 --> 46:16.194
But I was so scared of losing him...

46:16.228 --> 46:19.030
[Sighs]

46:19.064 --> 46:21.465
That I tried convincing
him he was crazy...

46:23.269 --> 46:26.104
and that being normal
would make things better.

46:28.207 --> 46:31.709
Thankfully, he had the
good sense not to listen to me.

46:31.743 --> 46:33.644
Regina's right.

46:35.113 --> 46:38.749
David, we've been
rationalizing, and you know it.

46:38.784 --> 46:41.018
We cannot let her take away
what's special about her.

46:41.052 --> 46:43.020
I know.

46:43.054 --> 46:44.955
Well, then let's go get her.

46:49.627 --> 46:51.195
Regina, your locator potion...

46:53.898 --> 46:55.199
it's gone.

46:55.233 --> 46:58.202
Where's Elsa?

46:58.236 --> 47:00.537
[Tinkling]

47:07.611 --> 47:09.679
- [Grunting]
- I'm sorry.

47:09.714 --> 47:11.280
Elsa won't save you.

47:11.315 --> 47:14.116
You don't know her. You don't know me.

47:14.151 --> 47:17.119
But I do. We're a lot alike.

47:17.154 --> 47:18.788
We had families,

47:18.823 --> 47:25.127
but we both grew up in this
palace, isolated and alone.

47:25.162 --> 47:30.967
I liked to go to the library
and bury myself in a good book.

47:31.001 --> 47:35.604
My favorite was an ancient norse
legend... The Trolden Glass.

47:35.638 --> 47:37.272
Perhaps you read it.

47:37.306 --> 47:39.541
Of course I did. I read
everything in there.

47:39.576 --> 47:41.977
Tell me what you remember.

47:42.011 --> 47:45.447
Giving a book report would be
a lot easier if you'd let me go.

47:45.482 --> 47:46.715
The other option is I kill you.

47:46.750 --> 47:48.884
It's about a norse king

47:48.918 --> 47:51.453
who had a beautiful
daughter he loved dearly.

47:51.488 --> 47:54.155
- Go on.
- He wanted his daughter

47:54.190 --> 47:56.391
to be able to see the
beauty he saw in her,

47:56.425 --> 47:58.559
so he had a mirror made for her birthday.

47:58.594 --> 48:00.728
But the day before it, she died,

48:00.763 --> 48:03.398
so instead of reflecting her beauty,

48:03.432 --> 48:05.901
it reflected the ugliness
of his pain and sorrow.

48:05.935 --> 48:09.670
Very good. What happened then?

48:09.705 --> 48:13.140
- It's been awhile, okay?
- I don't remember every detail.

48:13.174 --> 48:14.776
Well, I do.

48:14.810 --> 48:18.946
He was so devastated,

48:18.980 --> 48:22.283
he decided his kingdom
should share his pain.

48:22.317 --> 48:25.787
So he spent years harnessing dark magic,

48:25.821 --> 48:27.121
used it on the mirror,

48:27.155 --> 48:29.589
and cast a spell over his entire kingdom.

48:29.624 --> 48:31.591
It made his subjects

48:31.626 --> 48:35.695
see only the worst in the ones they loved.

48:35.730 --> 48:38.865
And they turned on each
other, destroying themselves.

48:38.900 --> 48:41.368
What does that story
have to do with anything?

48:41.403 --> 48:47.674
You were in my room. I'm
sure you saw the mirror.

48:47.708 --> 48:50.710
This is just a small piece of it.

48:50.745 --> 48:53.980
I spent years gazing into that mirror,

48:54.014 --> 48:58.318
but all I saw reflected
back at me was pain,

48:58.352 --> 48:59.819
just like the nordic king.

48:59.853 --> 49:03.823
You're going to cast that spell.

49:03.857 --> 49:07.493
The spell of shattered sight.

49:07.527 --> 49:09.329
[Chuckles]

49:09.363 --> 49:13.333
It would take an entire lifetime
to cultivate enough power

49:13.367 --> 49:17.169
to cast a spell over an entire kingdom.

49:17.203 --> 49:21.273
Luckily [Exhales sharply] I
only need to cast it over you.

49:23.076 --> 49:25.611
- [Gasps]
- [Blows]

49:39.525 --> 49:41.326
[Crickets chirping]

49:41.361 --> 49:45.163
[Brakes squeal]

49:45.198 --> 49:46.365
[Engine shuts off]

50:11.356 --> 50:13.290
[Beeping]

50:16.871 --> 50:18.364
You're sure these are from her bug?

50:18.364 --> 50:20.978
Oh, yeah, she definitely
spun out here, and then...

50:22.560 --> 50:24.360
She got out of the car and got back in.

50:24.394 --> 50:26.195
Anyone else out here?

50:26.229 --> 50:30.433
No. It's just her footprints. Come on.

50:30.467 --> 50:31.667
These are so fresh, we
can carry on on foot.

50:31.701 --> 50:33.702
She can't have gone far.

50:41.445 --> 50:44.080
So, before we were interrupted,

50:44.114 --> 50:47.916
you were telling me about Robin Hood.

50:47.951 --> 50:51.620
Oh, there's not much to
tell. It's not gonna work out.

50:51.654 --> 50:53.689
It's the story of my life.

50:53.723 --> 50:56.525
Whatever's working against my happiness

50:56.559 --> 50:58.627
is more powerful than I am.

50:58.661 --> 51:02.630
<i>Why does it have to work against you?</i>

51:02.664 --> 51:04.499
Look at me and David.

51:04.533 --> 51:06.167
We have faced impossible
odds numerous times...

51:06.202 --> 51:08.769
often because of you... [scoffs]

51:08.804 --> 51:10.938
And yet we've always worked out.

51:10.973 --> 51:13.608
You know why? Because we have hope.

51:13.642 --> 51:14.709
[Chuckles]

51:14.743 --> 51:16.344
You get a quarter from
the hope commission

51:16.379 --> 51:17.545
every time you say that word.

51:17.579 --> 51:18.646
Admit it.

51:18.680 --> 51:20.014
I'm serious.

51:20.048 --> 51:23.684
Well, it's easy for you
to say... you're a hero.

51:23.719 --> 51:24.919
Whenever you need help,

51:24.953 --> 51:26.988
it just magically shows
up, like Henry's book.

51:27.022 --> 51:29.156
Yeah, I think that when you do good,

51:29.190 --> 51:30.992
the universe takes care of
you. That's why it showed up.

51:31.026 --> 51:34.661
Well, it doesn't really matter why.

51:34.695 --> 51:37.331
<i>Your wishes are rewarded. Mine are crushed.</i>

51:37.365 --> 51:39.033
Well, I refuse to believe

51:39.067 --> 51:41.902
that happiness is impossible
for you to achieve.

51:41.936 --> 51:44.071
You've come too far.

51:44.105 --> 51:47.408
And, yes, you may be
sleeping with a married man,

51:47.442 --> 51:49.143
but guess what... so have I.

51:49.177 --> 51:52.646
Well, I've done far worse than that.

51:52.680 --> 51:55.815
Which doesn't mean that
you can't earn forgiveness,

51:55.850 --> 51:57.183
a chance at Grace.

51:57.217 --> 51:58.852
I have to believe that.

51:58.886 --> 52:01.021
If you do good hoping to be redeemed,

52:01.055 --> 52:03.523
is that... really good?

52:05.960 --> 52:08.428
<i>Maybe evil is born...</i>

52:08.462 --> 52:11.664
And that's just who I am.

52:11.698 --> 52:15.501
Regina... you saw me grow up.

52:15.536 --> 52:19.405
You know how selfish and
shallow I could be as a child.

52:19.440 --> 52:21.574
You know what I've done since.

52:21.608 --> 52:24.409
You have literally seen my heart.

52:24.444 --> 52:27.580
You know it's not untouched.

52:27.614 --> 52:30.749
You are not all evil, and I'm not all good.

52:30.784 --> 52:32.184
Things are not that simple.

52:32.218 --> 52:35.921
Well, whoever's guiding all
this seems to think it is.

52:35.956 --> 52:42.094
You're the hero, and I'm the villain.

52:42.128 --> 52:45.430
Free will be damned.

52:45.465 --> 52:47.932
It's all in the book.

52:47.967 --> 52:49.367
And we both know how it plays out.

52:49.402 --> 52:51.236
Mm, maybe, but maybe not.

52:51.270 --> 52:54.372
Your stories went poorly
because you made bad choices.

52:54.407 --> 52:57.374
But now you're making good ones.

52:57.409 --> 53:00.845
It may not happen as
quickly as you want, but...

53:00.879 --> 53:04.381
If you stay the course,
your happiness will come.

53:04.416 --> 53:06.484
You honestly believe that?

53:06.518 --> 53:09.186
It doesn't matter what I believe.

53:09.221 --> 53:11.623
What matters is that you do.

53:18.296 --> 53:21.398
Will: She's really something, all right.

53:21.433 --> 53:24.768
If evil queens are your type, which I get.

53:27.038 --> 53:29.173
You're still together, then.

53:29.207 --> 53:31.609
That is not relevant.

53:31.609 --> 53:33.510
Hey, no judgments here, mate.

53:33.544 --> 53:36.579
I was the one who told
you to follow your heart.

53:36.614 --> 53:39.386
I just want her to be happy,

53:39.386 --> 53:41.118
even if she thinks that's impossib...

53:41.152 --> 53:42.786
wait!

53:42.820 --> 53:44.187
Ah.

53:44.221 --> 53:46.156
Whoa!

53:46.190 --> 53:50.627
"1988 Mercedes-Benz 560SL repair manual."

53:50.661 --> 53:52.495
All due respect, I'm beginning to think

53:52.530 --> 53:55.498
your magic-library
theory might be a tad off.

53:55.533 --> 53:58.768
Any book we want is hardly
gonna be stacked beside...

53:58.802 --> 54:02.338
"The cat in the hat."

54:02.373 --> 54:04.674
Why would a cat want a hat?

54:04.708 --> 54:06.208
I've seen stranger.

54:06.242 --> 54:07.743
[Sighs]

54:10.346 --> 54:12.815
Wait.

54:12.849 --> 54:14.516
This wasn't here before.

54:14.551 --> 54:15.818
What wasn't here?

54:15.852 --> 54:17.953
I'm not sure.

54:20.723 --> 54:23.892
Incredible.

54:23.926 --> 54:25.460
What is it?

54:25.495 --> 54:27.896
I need to reach Regina.

54:27.930 --> 54:29.498
[Cellphone rings]

54:29.532 --> 54:32.634
Hello. Who is this? Regina, it's Robin.

54:32.669 --> 54:36.504
I've just found something
that you have to see right now.

54:36.538 --> 54:38.673
Right now? I'm... I'm sorry,
but I'm in the middle...

54:38.708 --> 54:40.842
Go. We've got this.

54:40.876 --> 54:43.178
He found something.

54:43.212 --> 54:45.513
Maybe hope worked.

54:45.547 --> 54:48.850
Well, if it did, I owe you a quarter.

54:48.884 --> 54:52.687
I'll be right there.

55:06.235 --> 55:09.870
Hello? Gold? You here?

55:09.904 --> 55:11.905
[Whooshing]

55:13.975 --> 55:16.143
- Gold?
- [Electricity crackles]

55:20.882 --> 55:23.884
Gold?

55:23.918 --> 55:26.253
[Crackling continues]

55:58.518 --> 56:02.053
Gold, you in there?!

56:02.088 --> 56:03.722
[Energy humming]

56:03.757 --> 56:05.357
[Electricity crackles]

56:06.826 --> 56:09.795
There's no need to shout.

56:09.829 --> 56:11.163
I'm right here.

56:11.197 --> 56:13.666
You'll forgive me if I keep my distance.

56:13.700 --> 56:14.900
It would appear your powers

56:14.934 --> 56:16.601
are growing increasingly out of control.

56:16.635 --> 56:18.937
Yeah, it was a rough night.

56:18.971 --> 56:21.239
So, what do I need to do?

56:21.274 --> 56:24.442
I've already cast the
spell inside that room.

56:24.476 --> 56:26.178
All you have to do is...

56:26.212 --> 56:28.980
Step through the door.

56:29.015 --> 56:31.816
Is something wrong?

56:31.850 --> 56:32.917
Just...

56:34.766 --> 56:36.253
I ran into the Snow Queen.

56:37.455 --> 56:38.356
Did you?

56:38.390 --> 56:39.691
Well, sort of.

56:39.725 --> 56:41.292
It was a projection or a hologram,

56:41.327 --> 56:42.727
or I don't know what it was.

56:46.132 --> 56:48.933
She said I shouldn't do this,
that you were trying to hurt me.

56:48.967 --> 56:51.268
All right, so now we know

56:51.303 --> 56:54.471
who doesn't want you to
do this... the villain.

56:54.505 --> 56:57.507
Sounds like an argument for
it, but maybe that's just me.

56:57.542 --> 56:59.877
That's what I said.

56:59.911 --> 57:01.111
But you still have doubts.

57:01.146 --> 57:02.379
Do you blame me?

57:02.413 --> 57:04.781
No.

57:04.816 --> 57:08.952
Is it safe? Will I be okay?

57:08.986 --> 57:11.855
No magic is without risk,

57:11.889 --> 57:14.791
even magic used to take away magic.

57:14.826 --> 57:18.395
Look, this is very much your choice.

57:18.429 --> 57:20.797
And, of course, it was also your idea.

57:20.832 --> 57:23.967
But it's gonna stop me from hurting people.

57:24.001 --> 57:25.969
That much I can promise, yes.

57:36.914 --> 57:38.881
What would you do?

57:38.915 --> 57:41.851
I wouldn't go in there for anything.

57:41.885 --> 57:44.186
What? Why?

57:44.220 --> 57:46.422
Because, Emma, I'm not like you.

57:46.456 --> 57:52.561
I'm a man who makes wrong
decisions, selfish decisions.

57:52.596 --> 57:55.330
But you spent all that
time looking for Neal.

57:55.365 --> 57:57.866
You sacrificed yourself to save the town.

57:57.901 --> 57:59.167
You married Belle.

57:59.202 --> 58:02.404
And each time, I meticulously
undid all the good.

58:02.438 --> 58:06.909
Neal is still gone, the
town is still in danger,

58:06.943 --> 58:10.978
and Belle, for better or
worse, she knows who I am,

58:11.013 --> 58:14.549
and that's the man who
always chooses power.

58:14.583 --> 58:16.751
She believes you can change.

58:16.786 --> 58:19.421
And I love her for that.

58:19.455 --> 58:22.089
But I fear she's quite likely wrong.

58:22.124 --> 58:26.294
But you, Emma?

58:26.328 --> 58:29.797
You don't need to change.

58:29.831 --> 58:32.967
Because you do the right thing.

58:33.001 --> 58:34.168
Always.

58:44.979 --> 58:46.847
Gold...

58:51.519 --> 58:53.587
Thank you.

58:54.773 --> 58:55.863
Of course.

58:57.459 --> 58:58.631
We have no choice.

59:24.765 --> 59:25.932
Hook: Swan!

59:25.966 --> 59:27.200
Watch your step, captain.

59:27.234 --> 59:29.102
The terrain's a little rough around here.

59:29.136 --> 59:31.237
Get out of my way, Crocodile.

59:31.271 --> 59:32.671
I'll die fighting

59:32.706 --> 59:34.406
before I let you use
that bloody hat on Emma.

59:34.441 --> 59:36.809
[Groans]

59:36.844 --> 59:40.446
[Grunting]

59:43.316 --> 59:45.851
Death can wait.

59:45.885 --> 59:47.486
How about before you depart,

59:47.520 --> 59:49.921
I'll treat you to a front-row seat

59:49.956 --> 59:53.091
and we can watch her
use that hat on herself?

59:53.126 --> 59:54.192
No.

59:54.227 --> 59:57.162
Oh, and, uh... In case
you were counting on

59:57.196 --> 59:58.830
Emma getting your message...

59:58.865 --> 59:59.998
Don't.

01:00:00.032 --> 01:00:02.000
[Grunting] No.

01:00:02.034 --> 01:00:03.635
I'm not one for loose ends.

01:00:03.669 --> 01:00:05.871
Don't worry.

01:00:05.905 --> 01:00:08.539
You'll get over her...

01:00:08.574 --> 01:00:10.642
Just like you got over Milah.

01:00:10.676 --> 01:00:13.645
How many centuries did that take?

01:00:13.679 --> 01:00:15.513
Oh, it matters not.

01:00:15.547 --> 01:00:18.383
This might even add
a little fuel to your fire.

01:00:18.417 --> 01:00:21.719
Don't tell me you haven't
missed the taste of vengeance.

01:00:21.754 --> 01:00:23.888
She's mother to your grandson, gold!

01:00:23.922 --> 01:00:25.456
Don't do this.

01:00:25.491 --> 01:00:27.659
I wish I didn't have to.

01:00:27.693 --> 01:00:30.295
But I need miss Swan.

01:00:30.329 --> 01:00:33.497
Surely you understand that.

01:00:35.767 --> 01:00:38.169
Elsa: Emma!

01:00:38.203 --> 01:00:39.870
Emma!

01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:56.520
[Ice crackling]

01:00:56.554 --> 01:00:57.887
[Lock clicks]

01:01:04.028 --> 01:01:06.662
Oh, thank goodness you're safe.

01:01:06.697 --> 01:01:08.264
At first, I couldn't find Ingrid.

01:01:08.299 --> 01:01:09.498
And ever since, I've been worried sick.

01:01:09.533 --> 01:01:13.002
I suppose I should be grateful.

01:01:13.037 --> 01:01:15.271
Did everything go all right?

01:01:15.306 --> 01:01:17.440
You seem upset.

01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:20.109
<i>What's all this?</i>

01:01:20.144 --> 01:01:22.378
Oh, I wanted to surprise
you with something special.

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:23.879
It's all chocolate.

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:26.248
I'm afraid the ice cream's long melted now,

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:28.417
but I can make you more if you'd like.

01:01:28.452 --> 01:01:31.186
That's just like you...

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:32.855
Thinking some food and fancy jewelry

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:35.057
can make up for everything
you did to me.

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:36.859
Everything I did to you?

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:38.531
Anna, what are you talking about?

01:01:38.704 --> 01:01:39.921
It all came back to me

01:01:39.921 --> 01:01:41.796
when we were in the
east wing of the palace,

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:44.799
how you ignored me for all those years,

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:46.902
left me to wander this place like a ghost.

01:01:46.936 --> 01:01:50.155
Is this a joke? Because of my ruse?

01:01:50.155 --> 01:01:51.708
Because if you're
trying to get back at me,

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:53.075
Anna, it isn't funny.

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:55.410
Do you want to know the worst part?

01:01:55.444 --> 01:01:57.078
You let me believe it was all my fault,

01:01:57.112 --> 01:02:00.382
that I had done something wrong.

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:02.049
How can you say these things?

01:02:02.084 --> 01:02:05.052
We promised we'd never be like this.

01:02:05.087 --> 01:02:06.888
What's happened?

01:02:06.922 --> 01:02:09.491
I've come to my senses.

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:12.126
Anna, no!

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.400
Oh, this isn't you.

01:02:13.574 --> 01:02:15.496
- It can't be.
- Snow Queen: I'm afraid it is.

01:02:16.904 --> 01:02:19.666
Ingrid, you're not...
in an urn. No.

01:02:19.701 --> 01:02:21.835
Fortunately, I have a chance to show you

01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:24.671
that I am the only one who
will ever understand you.

01:02:24.706 --> 01:02:27.408
Anna never will.

01:02:27.442 --> 01:02:29.910
Elsa: This is because of you.

01:02:29.944 --> 01:02:34.314
You used your magic to cast a spell on her.

01:02:34.348 --> 01:02:39.286
Yes, but a spell that
reveals her true feelings,

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:42.689
even if she wasn't able
to admit them before...

01:02:42.724 --> 01:02:47.794
Her deepest, darkest emotions
now brought into the light.

01:02:47.828 --> 01:02:50.630
You wouldn't even talk to me.

01:02:50.664 --> 01:02:53.934
"Go away, Anna. Go away, Anna."

01:02:53.968 --> 01:02:56.636
You were supposed to be my sister!

01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:57.971
I am your sister.

01:02:58.005 --> 01:03:01.307
Anna, please, put the down the urn.

01:03:01.341 --> 01:03:02.775
She won't listen to you, Elsa,

01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:05.010
just like your mother
wouldn't listen to me.

01:03:05.045 --> 01:03:08.414
The only way to stop her
is accept who you truly are.

01:03:08.449 --> 01:03:09.949
Use your powers on her.

01:03:09.983 --> 01:03:12.184
No. I won't give up on my sister.

01:03:12.218 --> 01:03:15.220
Do it, Elsa! Freeze her! No, I won't.

01:03:15.255 --> 01:03:17.489
I won't hurt my sister.

01:03:17.523 --> 01:03:19.825
Do it!

01:03:19.859 --> 01:03:21.060
Do what you will,

01:03:21.094 --> 01:03:24.430
but know that no matter
what, Anna, I love you.

01:03:31.404 --> 01:03:34.639
[Gasps] Wait. What?

01:03:34.674 --> 01:03:35.707
No!

01:03:35.741 --> 01:03:37.208
Elsa?!

01:03:37.242 --> 01:03:40.679
What did you make me do?

01:03:40.713 --> 01:03:42.180
You foolish girl.

01:03:42.214 --> 01:03:44.716
[Gasps] This is all your fault!

01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:46.885
Kristoff: Stay away from her!

01:03:46.919 --> 01:03:50.888
Oh. Here comes the noble hero.

01:03:50.922 --> 01:03:55.926
I know that look in your
eyes... in both of your eyes.

01:03:55.961 --> 01:03:57.061
Just let her go.

01:03:57.096 --> 01:04:01.499
Eventually, everyone sees me as a monster.

01:04:02.734 --> 01:04:07.037
Maybe it's time to embrace that...

01:04:07.071 --> 01:04:09.406
And be one.

01:04:10.742 --> 01:04:12.042
[Ice crackling]

01:04:37.401 --> 01:04:41.537
Elsa...

01:04:41.571 --> 01:04:46.042
You will accept who you are one day, too.

01:04:46.076 --> 01:04:49.211
And we will find our third sister,

01:04:49.246 --> 01:04:53.449
no matter how long it takes.

01:04:53.483 --> 01:04:55.817
[Energy crackling]

01:05:05.628 --> 01:05:08.463
Emma, stop!

01:05:08.497 --> 01:05:09.965
Elsa, what the hell are you doing here?

01:05:09.999 --> 01:05:11.132
You have to leave now.

01:05:13.502 --> 01:05:16.404
I'm sorry. I won't let you do this.

01:05:16.439 --> 01:05:20.308
My powers are out of
control. There's no other way.

01:05:20.342 --> 01:05:22.177
- Please, go, now.
- No.

01:05:22.211 --> 01:05:23.778
You didn't give up on me

01:05:23.812 --> 01:05:26.614
even when you nearly froze
to death in that ice cave,

01:05:26.648 --> 01:05:28.283
so I'm not giving up on you now.

01:05:28.317 --> 01:05:32.954
I know how scary it is,
hurting someone you love.

01:05:32.988 --> 01:05:36.857
I've lived in fear of that my entire life.

01:05:36.892 --> 01:05:40.160
But giving up your magic is not the answer.

01:05:40.195 --> 01:05:41.996
There is another way.

01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:43.664
Yeah, you told me all about
how Anna's love saved you,

01:05:43.699 --> 01:05:47.634
and that's great, but guess what.

01:05:47.668 --> 01:05:52.473
My version of that with Henry didn't work.

01:05:52.507 --> 01:05:54.508
This is all I have left.

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:03.283
[Electricity crackles]

01:06:03.318 --> 01:06:05.785
I was wrong.

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:10.724
It wasn't just Anna's love that saved me.

01:06:10.758 --> 01:06:12.391
What are you talking about?

01:06:12.426 --> 01:06:14.393
When I landed in this strange town,

01:06:14.428 --> 01:06:17.063
I was certain that
without Anna, I was doomed.

01:06:17.098 --> 01:06:20.333
But I got control over my
powers again without her.

01:06:20.367 --> 01:06:23.202
How?

01:06:23.237 --> 01:06:24.803
I didn't really know until today,

01:06:24.838 --> 01:06:26.539
until the same thing happened to you,

01:06:26.573 --> 01:06:27.906
and then it finally hit me.

01:06:27.941 --> 01:06:34.313
It's not only Anna's love
or Henry's that can save us.

01:06:34.348 --> 01:06:37.650
They accept us for who we
are, and that's important.

01:06:37.684 --> 01:06:43.656
But it's not enough. It's on us, too.

01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:48.861
You have to love yourself,
Emma, the good and the bad.

01:06:48.895 --> 01:06:52.531
The only way to ever truly
be in control of your powers

01:06:52.565 --> 01:06:53.898
is to embrace them.

01:06:53.932 --> 01:06:56.568
Because this...

01:06:56.602 --> 01:07:00.138
This is who you are.

01:07:06.579 --> 01:07:08.246
What are you doing?

01:07:09.549 --> 01:07:11.549
It's time to stop being afraid.

01:07:11.583 --> 01:07:13.551
But this could kill you.

01:07:13.585 --> 01:07:17.488
I'll take that risk if you will.

01:07:23.762 --> 01:07:26.530
[Electricity crackles]

01:07:35.607 --> 01:07:38.442
[Sighs]

01:07:40.011 --> 01:07:42.012
[Chuckling]

01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:47.617
[Sighs]

01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:54.821
[Energy warbling]

01:07:56.991 --> 01:07:58.724
[Exhales sharply]

01:07:58.759 --> 01:08:02.495
[Warbling stops]

01:08:02.529 --> 01:08:05.564
No.

01:08:05.599 --> 01:08:07.710
[Chuckles]

01:08:07.934 --> 01:08:09.735
Well, I'm guessing she
didn't go through with it.

01:08:11.128 --> 01:08:12.334
So sorry.

01:08:14.532 --> 01:08:17.167
Oh, but I do love the
look of loss on your face.

01:08:17.201 --> 01:08:19.669
[Laughs]

01:08:19.703 --> 01:08:21.804
I may not have the savior, pirate.

01:08:21.839 --> 01:08:28.245
But I assure you, today
won't be a complete loss.

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:31.581
I need to fill that hat with power, yes,

01:08:31.616 --> 01:08:34.551
but that was only part of the equation.

01:08:36.754 --> 01:08:40.990
Because I need something
else, a secret ingredient,

01:08:41.024 --> 01:08:44.827
one I didn't know about...

01:08:44.862 --> 01:08:47.496
Until an associate clued me in.

01:08:47.531 --> 01:08:49.666
A heart.

01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:50.966
Well, if you need my help procuring it,

01:08:51.001 --> 01:08:54.770
know the only help I give
you is with your demise.

01:08:54.804 --> 01:08:56.037
Oh, you're gonna help me, all right.

01:08:56.072 --> 01:08:57.038
Ah.

01:08:57.073 --> 01:08:59.006
You see, this spell

01:08:59.042 --> 01:09:02.144
is gonna finally separate
me from the dagger

01:09:02.179 --> 01:09:04.779
so it no longer holds power over me.

01:09:04.814 --> 01:09:06.848
But to cast it...

01:09:06.883 --> 01:09:09.685
I need the heart of someone special,

01:09:09.719 --> 01:09:13.188
someone who knew me before the dagger...

01:09:13.221 --> 01:09:15.356
Before I was the dark one.

01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:21.029
Unfortunately, everyone
who fits that description

01:09:21.064 --> 01:09:24.532
is already dead, but one still lives.

01:09:24.567 --> 01:09:26.634
No.

01:09:26.669 --> 01:09:28.969
No!
Yes.

01:09:29.004 --> 01:09:33.441
As luck would have it, dearie,
you're my oldest friend.

01:09:33.475 --> 01:09:36.277
- [Thud]
- [Screams]

01:09:36.312 --> 01:09:37.745
[Heart beating]

01:09:37.779 --> 01:09:40.481
Get on with it, then.

01:09:40.515 --> 01:09:42.649
Just do it.

01:09:42.684 --> 01:09:48.823
Oh, no. I promised you
we'd have some fun first.

01:09:48.857 --> 01:09:52.626
You're gonna do everything I say

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.762
because you're my puppet now.

01:09:54.796 --> 01:09:56.831
You're gonna find another way

01:09:56.865 --> 01:09:59.333
to fill that hat with the power it needs.

01:09:59.367 --> 01:10:04.438
And then? Then I'll kill you.

01:10:04.472 --> 01:10:10.777
I see someone's been practicing
their rock-troll memory magic.

01:10:10.811 --> 01:10:14.114
Quite impressive, dearie.

01:10:14.148 --> 01:10:17.516
You know, I-I prefer
her better this way.

01:10:17.551 --> 01:10:22.355
More cooperative. Less mouthy.

01:10:22.389 --> 01:10:24.023
Ooh.

01:10:24.058 --> 01:10:25.825
But this?

01:10:29.163 --> 01:10:31.631
This was much lovelier
when it was around her neck.

01:10:31.665 --> 01:10:35.301
You know... when she was breathing.

01:10:35.335 --> 01:10:37.536
What do you want, Rumplestiltskin?

01:10:37.571 --> 01:10:42.141
Just an old trinket your frozen
niece stole from me... a hat.

01:10:42.175 --> 01:10:43.743
I haven't seen it.

01:10:43.777 --> 01:10:44.877
[Giggles]

01:10:44.911 --> 01:10:49.447
Ooh, lying is so un-queenly, Ingrid.

01:10:53.252 --> 01:10:54.536
Where is she? Give her back...

01:10:54.536 --> 01:10:56.287
Careful, dearie.

01:10:56.321 --> 01:10:57.388
You're not the only one

01:10:57.422 --> 01:10:59.390
who knows
How to hide something of value.

01:10:59.424 --> 01:11:03.527
We wouldn't want it
lost forever, now would we?

01:11:03.561 --> 01:11:07.198
Though I'm curious why you took
memories from that poor girl.

01:11:07.232 --> 01:11:09.366
I mean, you would have thought

01:11:09.401 --> 01:11:12.303
being trapped inside a bread
bin was punishment enough.

01:11:12.337 --> 01:11:14.738
She learned more than she was meant to.

01:11:14.773 --> 01:11:16.907
I wanted us to have a fresh start.

01:11:16.941 --> 01:11:20.177
Don't we all, dearie? Don't we all?

01:11:20.211 --> 01:11:25.048
You know, uh... I'm
gonna make you a deal...

01:11:25.082 --> 01:11:30.253
an urn for a hat, as simple as that.

01:11:30.288 --> 01:11:31.587
And just to make it easy for you,

01:11:31.622 --> 01:11:34.590
when you "find" the object of my desire,

01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:37.694
just say my name three times,
and I shall come to you.

01:11:37.728 --> 01:11:40.263
See you soon!

01:11:40.298 --> 01:11:41.664
[Giggles]

01:11:46.903 --> 01:11:51.507
Swan! Are you all right?

01:11:51.542 --> 01:11:54.910
She didn't do it. She
didn't take away her magic.

01:11:54.945 --> 01:11:56.078
Wow, I've never seen people so happy

01:11:56.112 --> 01:11:57.847
<i>about me not doing something.</i>

01:11:57.881 --> 01:12:01.516
We'll find another way to defeat
the Snow Queen... together.

01:12:01.551 --> 01:12:02.918
Mm.

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:06.688
Mm. Easy, tiger, we've got company.

01:12:06.723 --> 01:12:09.291
I didn't know you were
such a fan of my magic.

01:12:09.326 --> 01:12:11.493
Why would you say that, Swan?

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:13.795
I'm a fan of every part of you.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.430
Are you all right?

01:12:15.465 --> 01:12:17.733
Of course, love. Why?

01:12:17.767 --> 01:12:19.067
If you look at me any harder,

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:21.703
you're gonna drill a hole in my head.

01:12:21.738 --> 01:12:24.539
I'm just relieved.

01:12:24.574 --> 01:12:26.475
You should go outside.

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:28.810
I have a feeling there
are a lot of worried people

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:30.679
who will be glad to see you.

01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:30.261
I got here as fast as I could.

01:13:30.295 --> 01:13:31.704
What's so important you
couldn't say over the phone?

01:13:31.704 --> 01:13:32.700
I'll show you in a second.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:35.133
But first, you remember this?

01:13:35.167 --> 01:13:38.003
Uh, the book you
apparently stole from me?

01:13:38.037 --> 01:13:40.204
Yes, I remember it quite well.

01:13:40.239 --> 01:13:41.405
You knew I was a thief when you met me.

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:43.807
All right, so, tonight,
I came here looking,

01:13:43.842 --> 01:13:46.644
trying to find a clue
towards that author...

01:13:46.678 --> 01:13:47.878
towards your happy ending.

01:13:47.912 --> 01:13:49.180
In the public library?

01:13:49.214 --> 01:13:52.383
Robin, my happy ending is not
a Stephen King book-on-tape.

01:13:52.417 --> 01:13:54.952
Hang on. But then the
strangest thing happened.

01:13:54.986 --> 01:13:56.720
I found something.

01:14:06.464 --> 01:14:07.931
[Gasps]

01:14:07.966 --> 01:14:10.267
Is this... Us?

01:14:10.301 --> 01:14:12.469
Yes.

01:14:12.503 --> 01:14:14.971
Inside the pub.

01:14:15.005 --> 01:14:17.740
I don't understand.
This isn't what happened.

01:14:17.775 --> 01:14:19.909
Is this from the book?

01:14:19.943 --> 01:14:21.978
23...Page 23.

01:14:22.012 --> 01:14:23.413
Is it missing from the book?

01:14:23.447 --> 01:14:25.782
No. No, it's already there,
and it's you leaving me.

01:14:25.816 --> 01:14:28.785
This goes in the same place.

01:14:28.819 --> 01:14:31.888
This is the meeting that we never had.

01:14:34.224 --> 01:14:37.093
What does it mean?

01:14:37.127 --> 01:14:40.429
It means that your fate could
have gone many different ways.

01:14:40.463 --> 01:14:42.364
It means you're not doomed to suffer.

01:14:42.399 --> 01:14:46.368
There's a bright future
for you around every turn,

01:14:46.403 --> 01:14:48.304
even if you miss one.

01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:53.141
Well, where did you find it?

01:14:53.176 --> 01:14:55.811
Is there another book? What shelf?

01:14:55.845 --> 01:14:58.480
No, it was in my satchel.

01:14:58.515 --> 01:14:59.615
What?

01:14:59.649 --> 01:15:01.950
Not at first. It wasn't
there when I left.

01:15:01.984 --> 01:15:03.785
It... appeared.

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:07.288
[Sighs] Like magic.

01:15:07.323 --> 01:15:08.556
It's a sign.

01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:11.727
And you can take it
however you want, but to me,

01:15:11.761 --> 01:15:15.831
it's showing you possibility... hope.

01:15:15.865 --> 01:15:20.368
That's not something that would
ever happen to a villain, is it?

01:15:23.972 --> 01:15:25.640
What is it?

01:15:28.009 --> 01:15:30.177
I owe someone a quarter.

01:16:53.459 --> 01:16:55.093
[Inhales sharply]

01:16:55.128 --> 01:16:57.595
Rumplestiltskin.

01:16:57.630 --> 01:16:59.097
Rumplestiltskin.

01:16:59.132 --> 01:17:01.633
- Rumplest...
- Apprentice: Stop!

01:17:01.667 --> 01:17:05.469
I have traveled far to find you.

01:17:05.503 --> 01:17:07.137
Why are you conjuring the dark one

01:17:07.171 --> 01:17:09.606
when you have a deal with the sorcerer?

01:17:09.641 --> 01:17:13.644
Do you doubt he can
find the sister you seek?

01:17:13.678 --> 01:17:16.814
No. But I lost the one that I already had.

01:17:16.848 --> 01:17:19.483
You told me you were a patient woman.

01:17:19.517 --> 01:17:24.321
Happy endings can take
a long time, but they do happen.

01:17:24.355 --> 01:17:27.858
Does that mean you found a match?

01:17:27.892 --> 01:17:30.293
The sorcerer did locate a
third magical sister, yes,

01:17:30.328 --> 01:17:34.430
and she... will be a perfect match.

01:17:34.465 --> 01:17:38.101
What do you mean, "will be"?

01:17:38.135 --> 01:17:41.103
Therein lies the catch.
She is not born yet.

01:17:41.137 --> 01:17:43.439
How does the sorcerer know something

01:17:43.474 --> 01:17:45.441
that hasn't happened yet?

01:17:45.476 --> 01:17:48.444
He knows many things.

01:17:48.479 --> 01:17:54.216
For example, he knows
that if you deliver that hat...

01:17:54.251 --> 01:17:59.654
To the dark one, you will
never find your happy ending.

01:17:59.689 --> 01:18:03.492
But if I give it to you...

01:18:03.526 --> 01:18:05.227
I will?

01:18:05.262 --> 01:18:09.064
You will find this third sister

01:18:09.099 --> 01:18:13.268
and be reunited with
the one you've just lost.

01:18:21.944 --> 01:18:26.147
This door will lead you to a new land...

01:18:26.181 --> 01:18:28.182
Where your happy ending awaits.

01:18:28.217 --> 01:18:34.022
Just hand over the box,
and I will open it for you.

01:18:34.056 --> 01:18:39.027
You said that the sorcerer
doesn't make deals...

01:18:39.061 --> 01:18:41.362
Especially with people like me.

01:18:41.397 --> 01:18:44.532
Why is he doing this now?

01:18:44.566 --> 01:18:48.201
The hat is important to him.

01:18:48.236 --> 01:18:51.572
And sometimes, people surprise you.

01:19:03.284 --> 01:19:05.285
[Breathing heavily]

01:19:08.423 --> 01:19:10.723
Now take this.

01:19:10.758 --> 01:19:16.063
When the time comes...

01:19:16.097 --> 01:19:19.599
It will lead you to your third sister.

01:19:43.190 --> 01:19:45.324
[Horn blares]

01:19:45.359 --> 01:19:47.360
[Indistinct conversations]

01:19:52.699 --> 01:19:55.767
[Horn honks]

01:19:59.873 --> 01:20:03.653
<i>Man: Hey, yo! Hold up!</i>

01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:07.379
[Siren wails]

01:20:12.118 --> 01:20:15.253
Emma! Did you do it?

01:20:15.287 --> 01:20:17.088
- Oh.
- I didn't, thanks to Elsa.

01:20:17.123 --> 01:20:18.144
[Chuckles]

01:20:18.144 --> 01:20:22.293
I'm so, so glad. Just...
Please don't change.

01:20:22.328 --> 01:20:23.361
I don't want to.

01:20:23.396 --> 01:20:24.461
David: We love you, no matter what.

01:20:24.496 --> 01:20:25.763
I know.

01:20:25.797 --> 01:20:28.132
Hey, kid. How are you?

01:20:28.166 --> 01:20:29.667
Just glad you're okay.

01:20:30.551 --> 01:20:34.258
So, your magic... are
you in control of it again?

01:20:34.641 --> 01:20:37.166
Absolutely.

01:20:57.359 --> 01:20:58.893
[Fireworks popping]

01:21:04.432 --> 01:21:06.567
[Chuckles]

01:21:19.664 --> 01:21:20.815
Cool.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:26.441
Mom, when did you get that?

01:21:26.476 --> 01:21:30.111
I don't know.

01:21:30.145 --> 01:21:32.813
Emma, what's happening?

01:21:34.583 --> 01:21:36.050
[Grunts] It won't come off.

01:21:36.085 --> 01:21:37.118
Mine won't, either.

01:21:42.358 --> 01:21:44.425
- Aah.
- I feel it, too.

01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:48.128
It's like it's funneling all
my magic away, like it's...

01:21:48.162 --> 01:21:49.797
Harnessing it somehow.

01:21:49.831 --> 01:21:51.799
Any idea what this is?

01:21:51.833 --> 01:21:53.438
No.

01:21:55.334 --> 01:21:57.379
But I have a pretty good
idea where it came from.

01:22:07.846 --> 01:22:09.814
You look disappointed.

01:22:09.848 --> 01:22:13.651
Miss Swan did not behave as I had hoped.

01:22:13.686 --> 01:22:15.086
Did you have a hand in it?

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:17.055
Of course not.

01:22:17.089 --> 01:22:19.590
My hands were trapped here the entire time.

01:22:19.624 --> 01:22:22.759
Although, as you said,

01:22:22.794 --> 01:22:25.429
the urn dust didn't last long at all.

01:22:25.464 --> 01:22:27.098
I'd keep my distance if I were you.

01:22:27.132 --> 01:22:30.434
You really don't understand
what's happening, do you?

01:22:30.469 --> 01:22:32.836
I wasn't the one who saved Emma.

01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:34.271
Elsa was.

01:22:34.306 --> 01:22:38.942
They really are quite wonderful
together... like sisters.

01:22:38.977 --> 01:22:41.612
Your strange fixation really
holds no interest for me.

01:22:41.646 --> 01:22:43.213
[Chuckling] Oh, but it should.

01:22:43.247 --> 01:22:44.380
And it will.

01:22:44.415 --> 01:22:48.685
You see, these ribbons were of no use to me

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.854
until this moment.

01:22:50.888 --> 01:22:53.022
They can bond
Three magical sisters together,

01:22:53.056 --> 01:22:57.227
but only if all of us are a perfect match.

01:22:57.261 --> 01:22:59.795
And what makes for this perfect match?

01:22:59.830 --> 01:23:01.797
When all three have
embraced their powers,

01:23:01.832 --> 01:23:05.335
which we now have, thanks to you.

01:23:09.006 --> 01:23:10.640
[Chuckles]

01:23:10.674 --> 01:23:13.809
Now I wield the magic of my three sisters.

01:23:13.844 --> 01:23:16.478
Now my mirror is complete.

01:23:16.513 --> 01:23:18.313
And with this power,

01:23:18.348 --> 01:23:22.752
I can finally cast a spell
over all of Storybrooke.

01:23:22.786 --> 01:23:25.787
I could probably even defeat you

01:23:25.821 --> 01:23:29.391
and decorate this place with your bones.

01:23:29.425 --> 01:23:30.626
Shall I try?

01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:35.997
Dearie, I warn you... do
not overestimate your power.

01:23:40.936 --> 01:23:45.940
And I warn you... don't underestimate it.
