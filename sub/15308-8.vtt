00:16.699 --> 00:18.960
Aren't you worried someone's gonna walk in?

00:19.022 --> 00:20.870
People are just getting to school,

00:21.648 --> 00:25.361
which leaves us plenty of time
for extracurricular activities.

00:25.444 --> 00:27.279
- Yes, sir, Mr. President.

It's nothing. [chuckles]

Now, where were we?

00:39.208 --> 00:41.502
Uh, you know, on, um, second thought,

00:41.585 --> 00:44.380
I am actually worried
someone's gonna walk in.

00:44.463 --> 00:46.965
- Really?
- Very worried. Um...

00:48.592 --> 00:51.132
- And I have, uh... uh, stuff to do.
- _

00:51.156 --> 00:53.138

we'll pick up where we left off.

and you're making jokes?

We'll start with speeches and
then, Maya, you'll play your song.

but you didn't get it from me.

not used to you always hurting me.

medical tests recently.

never gave you anything.

you were way happier
when you were with him.

You're right.

Miles to be done counseling.

We were talking about...

ladies to all of... that.

09:13.889 --> 09:15.724
Uh, later.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.521

09:20.604 --> 09:23.314
- I couldn't tell.
- [sighs]

Con, I ruined everything.

09:26.067 --> 09:27.360
Again.

09:31.490 --> 09:34.576
Well, first off, it's great that
you saved all these harassing posts.

09:34.660 --> 09:37.704
See, right there, where
the rape threats begin?

09:39.080 --> 09:41.166
This must be just awful for you.

09:42.375 --> 09:45.211
Do you have any idea who
has been harassing you?

09:45.295 --> 09:47.338
No, that's... that's the point.

09:47.422 --> 09:49.841
That's why you need to find
these jerks and arrest them.

09:49.925 --> 09:53.762
To be realistic, none of these posts
have any identifying information.

09:53.845 --> 09:56.347
If they blocked their IPs using a VPN,

09:56.431 --> 09:58.183
we're not exactly equipped
to track them down.

09:58.266 --> 09:59.392
But you're not gonna give up, right?

09:59.475 --> 10:00.852
We'll do everything that we can.

10:00.936 --> 10:02.228
We're hoping you might
be able to post an officer

10:02.312 --> 10:03.647
- to guard our house.
- Yeah, like, tonight.

10:03.730 --> 10:06.107
If we're to post an officer
at the home of every woman

10:06.191 --> 10:07.818
that gets threatening messages online,

10:07.901 --> 10:10.111
we'd have no one left
to patrol the streets.

10:10.195 --> 10:11.196
[Mrs. Matlin scoffs]

10:12.405 --> 10:13.657
Look, the truth is

10:13.740 --> 10:16.868
that in cases of harassment like this,
actual violence is extremely rare.

10:16.952 --> 10:18.662
But it has happened.

10:20.706 --> 10:22.207
Have you considered shutting
down your online accounts?

10:22.290 --> 10:23.625
[Mrs. Matlin scoffs]

10:23.709 --> 10:25.752
I... It's just, I live online.

10:25.836 --> 10:27.671
All my music stuff is online.

10:27.754 --> 10:30.674
Well, my advice is to
keep saving posts like this

10:30.757 --> 10:32.843
so that we can build a case
if they ever do something.

10:32.926 --> 10:33.927
Something like what?

10:34.010 --> 10:36.512
In the meantime, just try to
go about your day-to-day life.

10:36.597 --> 10:37.889
Okay, I'm gonna look into this,

10:37.973 --> 10:39.683
but I'm afraid that's all I can do for now.

10:39.766 --> 10:41.893
Come on, honey. Let's just go home.

10:43.604 --> 10:45.146
[Mrs. Matlin sighs]

10:52.195 --> 10:54.906
[Tristan] Okay, then there
was Vijay, and then Luke.

10:54.990 --> 10:57.408
- Uh-huh.
- Then other Luke.

10:57.492 --> 10:59.494
And then there was that guy with the abs

10:59.578 --> 11:02.038
who I want to say was on the swim team.

11:02.122 --> 11:04.332
Tris, that's five guys this term.

11:04.415 --> 11:05.500
Hell of a body count.

11:05.584 --> 11:08.003
Hello? This office is a safe
space. Are you shaming me?

11:08.086 --> 11:09.337
I'm not not shaming you.

11:09.420 --> 11:12.048
What if I never find the
dirtbag that chlamydiated me?

11:12.132 --> 11:13.341
That's the thing, though.

11:13.424 --> 11:15.426
This isn't just a list of suspects.

11:15.510 --> 11:17.595
This is also a list of potential victims.

11:17.679 --> 11:20.056
So you're saying that, depending
on when I acquired this gift,

11:20.140 --> 11:22.058
I could've given it to any of these guys?

11:22.142 --> 11:24.310
And until you tell them,
it could spread further.

11:24.394 --> 11:26.772
Excuse? Are you seriously
suggesting five different,

11:26.855 --> 11:29.482
"Hi, I might have given you
chlamydia" conversations?

11:29.565 --> 11:30.817
Hard pass.

11:30.901 --> 11:33.361
Look, maybe being president
got the better of you.

11:33.444 --> 11:35.238
But the presidential
thing to do is be honest.

11:35.321 --> 11:36.948
And let it get out to the school?

11:37.032 --> 11:39.367
[scoffs] It'll be a political sex scandal.

11:39.450 --> 11:40.535
I'll be impeached.

11:40.618 --> 11:41.745
Oh, no...

11:41.828 --> 11:42.954
I'm a Clinton.

11:43.038 --> 11:46.624
See, this is why life's better when
you never hook up with anyone, ever.

11:46.708 --> 11:48.543
This is so unfair.

11:48.626 --> 11:50.336
I mean, I just figured
out how to talk to guys,

11:50.420 --> 11:52.297
like, five minutes ago,
and it's all ruined.

11:52.380 --> 11:55.508
Unless I just... don't tell anyone.

11:55.591 --> 11:57.886
How's that working out, keeping
your horrible secret from Maya?

11:57.969 --> 11:59.429
Is it eating you up inside?

12:00.596 --> 12:01.932
The stress will kill me, won't it? [sighs]

12:03.308 --> 12:05.060
Maybe there's a plan B.

12:13.651 --> 12:15.821
[Tristan] "Notifyyourpartners.com"?

12:15.904 --> 12:19.282
It's a website that sends anonymous
"you might have an STI" email

12:19.365 --> 12:21.284
to past partners.

12:22.869 --> 12:25.038
Perfect. [chuckles softly]

12:25.121 --> 12:28.208
For once, anonymous mass
emails to the rescue.

12:28.291 --> 12:29.542
- [chuckles]
- Thank you.

12:30.668 --> 12:32.462
Thank you. Thank you.

12:35.090 --> 12:37.801
Um, well, if we're looking
at this right triangle,

12:37.884 --> 12:40.929
we can create an equation
to solve for the area,

12:41.012 --> 12:45.058
- which would be A=Â½(ah)
- [cell phone vibrates]

12:45.141 --> 12:47.602
...and then, because this doesn't
really give us much information,

12:47.685 --> 12:49.687
we can take a look at the diagram again,

12:49.771 --> 12:51.439
and using the second right triangle,

12:51.522 --> 12:54.650
- we can use sine C...

13:18.383 --> 13:19.384
What?

13:19.467 --> 13:22.178
Um, I... I said, "Solving for sine."

13:22.262 --> 13:24.264
Are you okay, Maya?

13:25.598 --> 13:27.642
- [sighs]
- [Goldi] As I was saying, um...

13:27.725 --> 13:29.227
- [cell phone vibrates]
- ...we're solving for sine,

13:29.310 --> 13:30.937
so we're gonna have to do

13:31.021 --> 13:33.481
B sine C...

13:54.085 --> 13:55.170
Hey.

13:55.253 --> 13:57.547
Sorry for kicking you
out so abruptly yesterday.

13:57.630 --> 14:00.591
No big. I was just there
to hang with Miles, anyways.

14:02.135 --> 14:04.262
[chuckling] Okay, then, uh, later.

14:05.513 --> 14:09.434
Though it is always nice to
know that I'm a good kisser.

14:09.517 --> 14:11.477
[sighs] Lola.

14:12.938 --> 14:15.273
And to be honest, I've been
kinda making a list of my own.

14:15.356 --> 14:16.357
Oh?

14:18.234 --> 14:19.235
Oh.

14:20.153 --> 14:22.072
Then it only seems fair
I should get to see it.

14:22.155 --> 14:23.531
Yeah? Okay.

14:26.409 --> 14:28.954
"Frankie has beautiful hair.

14:29.037 --> 14:30.746
Frankie's always super nice.

14:30.831 --> 14:32.207
Frankie's always so cheerful."

14:35.210 --> 14:37.503
- Winston...
- You don't have to say anything.

14:38.922 --> 14:40.298
I feel the same way.

14:44.928 --> 14:46.554
Well, I'll see you later.

14:49.265 --> 14:50.641
[sighs]

14:50.725 --> 14:54.312
Okay, um, next order of
business, the feminist assembly.

14:54.395 --> 14:55.856
Is everything good on your end, Goldi?

14:55.939 --> 14:58.316
Uh, yes. Um, it's being handled.

14:58.399 --> 14:59.567
Okay, great. Um...

14:59.650 --> 15:02.653
What STI did you give me, Tristan?

15:02.737 --> 15:04.030
How could you do this to me?

15:04.114 --> 15:05.240
What are you talking about?

15:05.323 --> 15:07.826
This anonymous email you sent me.

15:07.909 --> 15:08.910
[student scoffs]

15:08.994 --> 15:12.080
[chuckles] How do you even
know that message came from me?

15:12.163 --> 15:16.751
Tristan... you're the only
guy I ever did anything with.

15:16.835 --> 15:19.337
Please, just tell me how bad it is.

15:19.420 --> 15:22.132
- Am I gonna die?
- Okay, Vijay, just...

15:22.215 --> 15:23.591
calm down.

15:23.674 --> 15:25.135
It's just chlamydia.

15:25.218 --> 15:26.636
[students snickering]

15:34.853 --> 15:37.063
You didn't have to ditch
school just because I did.

15:37.147 --> 15:39.900
Hey... of course I did.

15:41.985 --> 15:43.528
You know I'd do anything for you, right?

15:43.806 --> 15:45.850
This is just so unfair, Zig.

15:46.990 --> 15:48.324
I know.

15:48.408 --> 15:51.702
I mean, I know that the
threats are probably fake,

15:51.786 --> 15:53.246
but there's just so many.

15:54.247 --> 15:55.874
And nowhere feels safe anymore.

15:56.749 --> 15:59.585
I write one song to stand up for myself

15:59.669 --> 16:01.880
and now I just feel so... wrecked.

16:02.964 --> 16:04.715
And then I get mad at myself
for how wrecked I feel.

16:04.799 --> 16:07.468
I wish I could just get my
hands on one of these losers.

16:07.552 --> 16:10.221
I mean, is it my fault? Did
I ignore it for too long,

16:10.305 --> 16:13.016
- or get too angry?
- Hey.

16:13.099 --> 16:14.434
You didn't do anything wrong.

16:14.517 --> 16:15.726
I know.

16:16.769 --> 16:18.396
I'm just so upset I have
to miss the assembly.

16:18.479 --> 16:21.274
I mean, Goldi and I put
a lot of work into it.

16:21.357 --> 16:22.650
Well, maybe you don't have to.

16:22.733 --> 16:24.027
Do you have Goldi's number?

16:24.110 --> 16:25.153
Yeah, sure, but why?

16:25.236 --> 16:29.199
Well... if she signs
out some AV equipment...

16:29.282 --> 16:30.533
maybe we can livestream you from here.

16:30.616 --> 16:33.369
And then I could speak at the
assembly without having to leave home.

16:33.453 --> 16:34.745
What if it makes it worse?

16:34.829 --> 16:38.333
Well, it's not a perfect
solution... and it's still not fair.

16:38.416 --> 16:40.876
But it's definitely not staying quiet.

16:40.961 --> 16:43.338
You don't even know how
much you're the best.

16:45.673 --> 16:46.925
[sighs]

16:47.883 --> 16:49.427
Awesome.

16:49.510 --> 16:51.554
- Let's get to work.
- Okay.

16:54.265 --> 16:55.850
He had a whole list of his own.

16:55.934 --> 16:58.311
So he wants to get back together.

16:58.394 --> 17:00.271
What's wrong? Was his list weird?

17:00.355 --> 17:01.856
No. It was just stuff like,

17:01.940 --> 17:03.649
"She's nice and she has nice hair."

17:03.733 --> 17:04.733
He said you have nice hair?

17:04.817 --> 17:06.361
That's, like, the best
compliment someone could get.

17:06.444 --> 17:07.988
Yeah, I'm confused.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.739
You didn't, like, kiss him?

17:09.821 --> 17:11.491
It's like...

17:11.574 --> 17:12.992
the last time Winston and I kissed,

17:13.076 --> 17:14.953
he tasted like peanut butter.

17:16.829 --> 17:18.914
Okay, I know I've never kissed a boy,

17:18.999 --> 17:20.665
but am I missing something?

17:20.750 --> 17:23.002
No, it's that, ever since then,

17:23.086 --> 17:24.462
every time I taste peanut butter,

17:24.545 --> 17:26.422
I remember the last time
Winston and I kissed.

17:26.506 --> 17:29.384
When I kiss Tiny, he sometimes
tastes like breath mints.

17:29.467 --> 17:31.219
It's hot. [chuckles]

17:31.302 --> 17:33.888
Anyway... "Something,
something, peanut butter"?

17:33.972 --> 17:35.598
So I remember the last time we kissed,

17:35.681 --> 17:38.101
and then I remember how badly things ended.

17:38.184 --> 17:40.186
And now I just keep thinking...

17:40.270 --> 17:41.771
do I even like peanut butter?

17:42.772 --> 17:44.274
[Goldi] Good afternoon.

17:44.357 --> 17:47.443
Welcome nines and tens, to
today's Feminist Club assembly.

17:47.527 --> 17:51.114
Great, time to be bored for the next hour.

17:51.197 --> 17:52.907
And don't worry.

17:52.991 --> 17:54.117
Peanut butter makes everything better.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.786
Unless you go into anaphylactic shock.

17:56.869 --> 17:58.538
[Goldi] Later on, we're
going to be speaking

17:58.621 --> 18:01.332
to the co-president of the
Feminist Club, Maya Matlin,

18:01.416 --> 18:03.626
live via webcam from her home.

18:03.709 --> 18:06.837
Also, she will be playing a
song, which should be cool.

18:14.679 --> 18:16.722

18:25.315 --> 18:27.442
I have last period free,
and you are the only thing

18:27.525 --> 18:29.110
standing between me and home. Be gone.

18:29.194 --> 18:30.903
Have you seen the doctor yet?

18:30.986 --> 18:33.073
Because I'm basically a leper now?

18:33.156 --> 18:34.990
Very droll. Excuse me.

18:35.075 --> 18:36.701
I'm genuinely asking.

18:37.785 --> 18:40.163
You shouldn't let these
things slide for too long.

18:40.246 --> 18:41.372
You're being nice to me?

18:41.456 --> 18:43.333
I just...

18:43.416 --> 18:45.293
I understand what it's like to mess up.

18:46.294 --> 18:48.713
Like, big time understand.

18:50.090 --> 18:52.467
I went to the doctor at lunch.

18:52.550 --> 18:53.759
And... [inhales]

18:53.843 --> 18:55.345
I have zero chlamydia

18:55.428 --> 18:58.264
and one urinary tract infection.

18:59.890 --> 19:01.892
[stammers] I'm sorry.

19:01.976 --> 19:04.270
- [chuckles]
- So for now, I'm thinking

19:04.354 --> 19:05.771
way more protection

19:05.855 --> 19:08.274
and way less online diagnosis.

19:08.358 --> 19:11.611
I have a... free period, too.

You wanna, uh, grab a drink?

20:16.967 --> 20:19.512
the harassment I've gotten lately...

20:19.595 --> 20:21.431
it all comes from the same thing.

20:21.514 --> 20:22.682
It's people saying,

20:22.765 --> 20:26.311
"I'm allowed to do this to
her because she's just a girl."

20:27.603 --> 20:29.147
[Maya sighs]

20:29.230 --> 20:33.484
<i>Words like "slut" and "rape..."</i>

20:33.568 --> 20:35.236
<i>they matter.</i>

20:35.320 --> 20:38.781
<i>They make us feel
devalued and threatened.</i>

20:38.864 --> 20:41.201
<i>They choose words that inflict pain,</i>

20:41.284 --> 20:44.620
<i>and then they tell us it's our
fault for getting upset about it.</i>

20:44.704 --> 20:46.872
<i>These words are meant
to silence us but...</i>

20:46.956 --> 20:48.499
- [banging on door]
- [man] Maya Matlin?

20:48.583 --> 20:49.667
[Maya] Yes?

20:49.750 --> 20:52.337
Down on the ground! Face down!
Do it now! Face on the ground!

20:52.420 --> 20:53.629
- Do it now!
- [officer 1] Hey, get down!

20:53.713 --> 20:54.880
[officer 2] Put your
hands behind your back!

20:54.964 --> 20:57.300
- Why are you doing this?
- [officer 2] Hands on your back!

20:57.383 --> 20:58.884
<i>- Hands on your back!</i>
- [indistinct chattering]

20:58.968 --> 21:00.970
[officer 3] <i>Bedroom's
clear.</i> <i>Face down!</i>

21:02.180 --> 21:05.099
- [officer 5] <i>Clear!</i>
- [officer 6] <i>Clear! Clear!</i>

21:09.187 --> 21:10.938
- [siren wailing]
- [police radio static]

21:11.021 --> 21:13.733
[woman on radio] <i>This is dispatch.</i>
<i>Stand down. It's a prank call.</i>

21:13.816 --> 21:16.194
Copy that. Dispatch says it's
nothing but a stupid prank.

21:16.277 --> 21:17.528
Weapons down.

21:17.612 --> 21:19.864
- [officer 7] Let's go.
- I got you. I got you.

21:21.031 --> 21:22.242
Are you two okay?

21:22.325 --> 21:23.618
What the hell was that?

21:23.701 --> 21:26.496
911 received a call from someone
claiming to be Maya Matlin.

21:26.579 --> 21:29.081
What? I don't understand.

21:29.164 --> 21:31.459
Caller claimed they had shot someone
and they were holding hostages,

21:31.542 --> 21:33.794
- which is why my team was dispatched.
- [Zig] I've heard about this.

21:33.878 --> 21:35.380
They... they call it "swatting."

21:35.463 --> 21:36.964
Yeah, some prank.

21:37.047 --> 21:39.717
Not only is it wasteful,
but it's extremely dangerous.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.886
This must've been terrifying
for you two. I'm really sorry.

21:41.969 --> 21:45.014
I'll post a patrol car outside
for your safety tonight.

21:45.097 --> 21:47.975
You have my word, we'll
find out who did this.

21:48.058 --> 21:51.562
Whatever. Just so happy
they're far, far away from here.

21:51.646 --> 21:52.980
[Zig exhales deeply]

21:53.063 --> 21:56.484
Yeah, some jerks way out in
Wisconsin or wherever, right?

21:57.652 --> 21:59.320
- Actually...
- [Maya] What?

22:00.530 --> 22:01.947
Dispatch traced the call.

22:02.031 --> 22:05.660
It came from a disposable
phone here in Toronto.

22:17.338 --> 22:19.089
- Eight months. Yeah.
- [boy] Yeah.

22:21.050 --> 22:22.593
[sighs]

22:22.677 --> 22:25.305
- [boy] Yeah.
- [Winston] Yeah. Love those.

22:25.388 --> 22:28.391
Funny. No matter where I go, there you are.

22:28.474 --> 22:30.393
Oh, great.

22:31.477 --> 22:33.145
Do you just, like, stalk me
so you can dispense elderly

22:33.228 --> 22:34.229
"I got held back a grade" wisdom?

22:34.314 --> 22:36.106
Do you kiss your trust
fund with that mouth?

22:36.190 --> 22:38.776
The last thing I need right now
is some super-predictable lecture

22:38.859 --> 22:40.486
about how I'm not being
honest with myself or whatever.

22:40.570 --> 22:42.572
Hmm. You're right, you should
probably go talk to your besties.

22:42.655 --> 22:44.156
I'm sure they give much better advice.
