16:54.100 --> 16:56.500
Alright, Black Wolf.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.166
Put me down, Wahush!

17:31.733 --> 17:35.666
You shouldn't smile so much, Sokanon.

17:36.666 --> 17:40.466
It ruins your scowl.

29:35.566 --> 29:42.033
If we take their furs,
the HBC will be desperate for more.

29:42.033 --> 29:47.066
You can trade for a better price,
do more for your people.

29:47.466 --> 29:52.766
I see how he's changed you.

29:54.233 --> 29:56.100
Michael has strength.

29:56.100 --> 29:58.700
He believes in himself as few do.

30:08.166 --> 30:12.033
I came here for your help.

30:16.500 --> 30:19.233
You're here for me.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.600
This was a mistake.

33:28.633 --> 33:29.733
...after dinner?
