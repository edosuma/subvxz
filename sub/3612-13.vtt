00:06.215 --> 00:07.250
Mr. Locke?

00:09.468 --> 00:10.674
Mr. Locke?

00:13.264 --> 00:14.720
Mr. Locke, can you hear me?

00:19.812 --> 00:20.801
Welcome back.

00:22.398 --> 00:23.604
I know you.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.857
We were on the same flight
back from Sydney.

00:26.944 --> 00:30.186
I met you in the Baggage Claim office.
You had lost your knives.

00:32.909 --> 00:34.115
I'm Jack Shephard.

00:36.996 --> 00:38.486
What happened?

00:39.415 --> 00:42.657
You were run down by a car.
You just came out of surgery.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.076
Am I...

00:48.257 --> 00:50.794
- Am | all right?
- Your dura| sac ruptured.

00:51.802 --> 00:54.544
But I think I got everything
back were it belongs.

00:58.309 --> 01:01.517
Mr. Locke, while operating, I got a look
at the initial injury to your spine,

01:01.604 --> 01:03.515
the one that put you
in the wheelchair.

01:03.606 --> 01:06.143
And l was hoping you could
tell me how that happened.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.265
Why?

01:09.654 --> 01:11.394
Because I think you're a candidate.

01:15.159 --> 01:16.990
A candidate for what?

01:17.078 --> 01:20.696
A new procedure,
a surgery we're developing, and...

01:22.041 --> 01:24.407
...if it works, it could restore
feeling to your legs.

01:24.502 --> 01:26.584
In fact, you may even walk again.

01:27.630 --> 01:32.590
If you'll give me a shot, Mr. Locke,
I think that I could fix you.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.925
No, thank you.

01:41.227 --> 01:44.094
Well, now there's minimal risk,
and the benefit could...

01:44.188 --> 01:45.644
I said no, Doctor.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.598
John?

01:51.028 --> 01:52.017
John.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.691
It's the first time they let me see you.

01:56.409 --> 01:59.116
-Are you OK?
- I'm fine. Hi.

02:00.371 --> 02:03.363
- Are you his doctor?
- Yes, I am. Dr. Shephard.

02:04.542 --> 02:05.622
Thank you.

02:06.085 --> 02:08.747
Thank you. Thank you for saving him.

02:10.256 --> 02:11.371
Thank you.

02:28.274 --> 02:29.935
Welcome to Hydra island.

02:35.406 --> 02:36.942
At least you didn't have to paddle.

02:57.345 --> 02:58.630
Get in.

03:00.264 --> 03:02.255
Ain't no way I'm gettin'
back in those cages.

03:02.350 --> 03:06.593
- Well, I've got the gun, so you...
- Not anymore, Doughboy.

03:07.438 --> 03:08.848
Drop the gun!

03:08.939 --> 03:11.021
Put the gun down or I'll kill her!

03:12.151 --> 03:15.314
You ain't gonna kill anybody. OthenNise,
you wouldn't be throwing us in a cage.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.110
l have a list of names.

03:17.198 --> 03:20.531
Ford, you're on it,
as are Reyes and the Kwons.

03:21.911 --> 03:23.902
Kate Austen? She's not.

03:23.996 --> 03:26.703
It doesn't matter to me
whether she lives or dies.

03:26.791 --> 03:28.577
Don't listen to him.

03:48.312 --> 03:51.679
You may not believe it,
but I'm doing this for your own good.

03:52.525 --> 03:55.312
You're right. I don't believe it.

03:57.530 --> 03:59.441
- Is the fence live yet?
- They're saying about an hour.

03:59.532 --> 04:02.239
We haven't got an hour.
Tell them to work faster.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.655
He's coming.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.349
Hello?

04:37.903 --> 04:39.768
Excuse me? Hello?

04:41.907 --> 04:45.741
I'm sorry. There was no one out front,
and I heard the drill.

04:45.828 --> 04:47.284
Do you know where I can find Dr. Nadler?

04:47.371 --> 04:48.781
Well, you can find him right here.

04:49.540 --> 04:52.782
And if you're not a patient,
you can call me Bernard.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.868
Hi. Jack Shephard.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.297
I'm a surgeon over at St. Sebastian,

05:00.384 --> 05:03.592
and l was hoping to get a look
at one of your patient files.

05:03.679 --> 05:06.512
- And which patient would that be?
- His name's John Locke,

05:06.599 --> 05:11.309
and our records said that you had done
some emergency oral surgery on him

05:11.395 --> 05:13.932
- about three years back.
- What are you looking for?

05:14.023 --> 05:15.763
I wanna know how he was hurt.

05:16.692 --> 05:20.401
Do you mind if I ask you why you're
so interested in Mr. Locke, Jack?

05:25.117 --> 05:28.905
He and I met about a week ago. We were
on the same flight back from Australia.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.736
Oceanic 815.

05:34.293 --> 05:35.908
| sat across the aisle from you.

05:38.130 --> 05:41.839
Memory serves, you were flirting with my
wife, Rose, when l was in the bathroom.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.087
It's pretty weird.

05:45.888 --> 05:46.923
Yeah.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.766
Well... maybe you're
on to something here.

05:55.773 --> 05:58.435
Now I can't break
patient confidentiality

05:58.526 --> 06:00.016
and tell you something I shouldn't,

06:00.110 --> 06:03.352
but I can tell you
that when I treated Mr. Locke,

06:03.447 --> 06:05.938
there was another man
in the same accident with him.

06:06.033 --> 06:09.150
Wait, that was... three years ago.
You just... remember that?

06:10.287 --> 06:11.743
Of course I do, Jack.

06:16.377 --> 06:17.457
Anthony Cooper.

06:18.546 --> 06:19.786
Good luck, Doc.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.126
I hope you find what you're looking for.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.301
What happened?

06:34.562 --> 06:36.473
There was a mortar attack.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.680
Widmore's people fired on us.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.523
Locke saved you.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.277
What about the rest of your group?
What happened to them?

06:49.368 --> 06:52.030
The ones who weren't killed
scattered into the jungle.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.703
It's just the three of us now.

06:55.833 --> 06:56.868
Why did he bring me here?

06:57.376 --> 06:59.958
Because your friends
got themselves captured.

07:00.045 --> 07:03.833
And now... we're gonna
have to rescue them.

07:04.842 --> 07:05.957
Rescue them from what?

07:06.051 --> 07:07.632
Widmore has them in a cage

07:07.720 --> 07:10.211
- about a half a mile inland.
- Why would he...?

07:10.306 --> 07:14.470
I would ask him, except I don't think
he's gonna give me a straight answer.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.851
But I can't imagine
that his intentions are good.

07:18.856 --> 07:22.940
If we move right now, we can break
your people out, run for the plane

07:23.027 --> 07:25.939
and be off this island before
Widmore knows what hit him.

07:28.532 --> 07:29.897
They're not my people.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.866
And I'm not leaving the island.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.742
Jack, I'm hoping you
still change your mind about that.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.749
But your friends do want to leave.

07:41.337 --> 07:44.704
And since they just ran away
from me on my own boat,

07:46.050 --> 07:48.632
I'm gonna need your help
convincing them they can trust me.

07:50.429 --> 07:51.714
Why should I trust you?

07:54.433 --> 07:58.802
Because I could kill you, Jack,
right here, right now.

07:58.896 --> 08:01.512
And I could kill every
single one of your friends,

08:01.607 --> 08:03.768
and there's not a thing
you could do to stop me.

08:05.110 --> 08:09.274
But instead of killing you, I saved your
life. And now I wanna save them, too.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.199
So will you help me?

08:32.262 --> 08:34.218
You feel like we're runnin' in circles?

08:34.973 --> 08:36.429
Back in these cages...

08:39.019 --> 08:41.601
Except last time,
the gun was to my head.

08:42.773 --> 08:44.434
He wouldn't have killed me, James.

08:49.405 --> 08:52.989
That cave I told you about,
where all the names are written?

08:54.785 --> 08:57.618
Your name was there, too,

08:57.705 --> 08:59.491
but it was crossed out.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.199
He doesn't need you, Kate.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.467
So she's with your mother?

09:14.888 --> 09:18.130
Yes. You saw her pictures? How?

09:18.976 --> 09:21.217
Widmore's people found
your camera on the plane.

09:22.521 --> 09:23.931
He showed me the pictures.

09:25.149 --> 09:29.142
Our daughter, she's so beautiful.

09:34.825 --> 09:36.110
l have your ring.

10:02.686 --> 10:03.926
What happened?

10:07.816 --> 10:09.192
Somebody shut us down?
What's going on?

10:11.320 --> 10:14.062
- Somebody killed the power.
- Get a team to that generator now!

10:23.832 --> 10:25.038
And we're dead.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.066
I think I can reach the keys.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.325
Hurry. When that thing's done
with them, he's coming for us.

11:02.412 --> 11:03.618
Well, I ain't waitin'.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.155
Damn it!

11:19.596 --> 11:20.927
What are you doing here?

11:23.725 --> 11:26.467
I'm with him. Come on.

11:41.451 --> 11:44.864
- How much further to the plane?
- About a quarter-mile, over that ridge.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.240
You're coming with us now?

11:47.457 --> 11:49.869
I'm gonna take you to the plane,
but I'm not getting on it.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.879
I'm sorry, Kate. l'm...

11:54.339 --> 11:55.590
I'm not meant to go.

11:58.969 --> 12:01.506
Thanks for coming back for us, Doc.
Appreciate it.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.138
No, it's OK.

12:11.023 --> 12:13.514
Sayid's with us. He was the one
who turned off the generators.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.690
Great. The more the merrier.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.563
We need to go. Locke's waiting.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.744
Are you a relative of Mr. Cooper's?

12:29.625 --> 12:30.740
No, I'm not.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.916
- But...
- May | ask the nature of the visit?

12:33.337 --> 12:34.827
Dr. Shephard?

12:35.505 --> 12:36.836
Hey.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.505
What are you doing here?

12:39.718 --> 12:41.583
I'm here to see Anthony Cooper.

12:41.678 --> 12:44.010
Do you know him?
Is that why you're here, too?

12:45.182 --> 12:46.513
What do you want with Anthony?

12:47.184 --> 12:50.722
I wanna talk to him about the accident
that he was in with Mr. Locke.

12:52.356 --> 12:55.189
Dr. Shephard... just go.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.400
Look, all I wanna do is help him.

12:58.487 --> 13:01.775
I know. John told me
about the operation.

13:01.865 --> 13:04.356
- He doesn't want it.
- Why doesn't he want it?

13:04.451 --> 13:07.614
Please, Dr. Shephard,
just leave this alone.

13:08.914 --> 13:11.951
You saved John's life.
Why can't that be enough?

13:14.544 --> 13:15.704
Because it's not.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.588
Housekeeping, dial 23.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.046
Housekeeping, extension 23.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.398
Hi.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.590
This is Anthony Cooper.

14:08.890 --> 14:10.346
He's John's father.

14:20.610 --> 14:21.941
Hey! Stop!

14:23.030 --> 14:24.019
Stop right there!

15:46.988 --> 15:50.822
Well, all righty. Let's see what
it'll take to get this baby to fly.

16:00.252 --> 16:01.992
Son of a bitch.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.673
- His neck's been broken.
- That's because I broke it.

16:18.603 --> 16:21.720
If it's any consolation, Widmore knew
that I would kill these men.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.100
What are you talking about?

16:23.191 --> 16:25.056
They were only
guarding the plane for show.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.317
lf Charles had wanted to keep me
from getting onboard,

16:28.405 --> 16:30.942
he wouldn't have moved
his little fences.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.649
Well, wait. Now he wants us
to leave the island?

16:33.743 --> 16:37.577
No, Hugo. He wants to get us all
in the same place at the same time.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.246
A nice, confined space we have
no hope of getting out of.

16:41.543 --> 16:42.999
And then he wants to kill us.

16:44.754 --> 16:47.006
- Kill us with what?
- With this.

16:51.136 --> 16:52.876
Four bricks of C4.

16:54.806 --> 16:56.467
I found 'em in one
of the overhead compartments,

16:56.558 --> 16:58.674
wired to the electrical system
of the plane.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.926
If we would've turned it on...

17:07.194 --> 17:08.183
So what now?

17:08.278 --> 17:10.735
We can't be sure he didn't put
more explosives on the plane.

17:10.822 --> 17:12.528
It's not safe.

17:12.616 --> 17:16.450
If we're gonna leave the island,
I think we have to take the submarine.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.449
That's what I've been sayin' all along.

17:20.540 --> 17:24.283
Dude, wait. He's not
supposed to leave the island.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.828
- I mean, Alpert said...
- Screw Alpert. He ain't here.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.044
That's twice you've saved our asses.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.963
Guess I was wrong about you.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.420
Thank you, James.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.591
That submarine is gonna be
heavily defended.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.425
We're gonna need everyone.

17:44.940 --> 17:47.977
I'll help you, but like I said,
I'm not going with you.

17:49.903 --> 17:50.938
Fair enough.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.239
Let's go.

18:00.538 --> 18:01.618
Hey.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.744
- I'm sorry that l...
- That's all right, Claire.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.665
I understand why you went with them.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.414
Hey, Doc, listen up.

18:12.509 --> 18:15.296
You don't wanna leave this island,
that's your own business.

18:15.387 --> 18:17.378
But I'm gonna ask you
for one last favor.

18:18.056 --> 18:21.514
I don't trust that thing one bit,
so here's what I need you to do.

18:21.601 --> 18:25.059
Once we get to the dock,
you make sure it doesn't get on the sub.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.848
How am I supposed to do that?
You saw what it did back there.

18:29.526 --> 18:32.017
Just get it in the water.
I'll take care of the rest.

18:39.494 --> 18:43.032
CT test to trauma 3.
CT test to trauma 3.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.621
Mr. Locke, are you awake?

18:47.877 --> 18:49.378
Push the button.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.205
Mr. Locke, can you hear me?

18:53.300 --> 18:55.291
| wish you had believed me.

18:59.556 --> 19:00.716
Excuse me?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.312
Miss Littleton.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.062
Dr. Shephard. l was
just looking for you.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.231
The lawyer told me you work here.

19:13.903 --> 19:16.394
- Can we talk?
- Yes. Yes.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.037
No. I'm OK.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.499
I'm sorry I had to run out
of the will reading the other day,

19:29.586 --> 19:32.043
- but I did have an emergency and...
- No worries.

19:35.967 --> 19:39.551
I know this is as awkward
for you as it is for me.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.298
I never even met this man.

19:43.266 --> 19:45.177
Anyway, the lawyer gave me this.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.680
She said there'd be more stuff to come,

19:47.771 --> 19:51.730
but that my father especially
wanted me to have this.

19:52.442 --> 19:55.605
You know why
or what it's supposed to mean?

19:56.821 --> 19:58.231
l have no idea.

19:58.323 --> 20:01.941
But then...
I didn't know about you, either.

20:05.747 --> 20:06.987
Our father...

20:08.166 --> 20:10.122
You mind if I ask how he died?

20:13.129 --> 20:15.962
He was found in an alley
outside a bar in Sydney.

20:17.175 --> 20:18.711
He drank himself to death.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.798
I flew down to bring his body back,
but then...

20:24.140 --> 20:26.005
...the airline lost it.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.301
| just flew in from Sydney few days ago.

20:30.105 --> 20:32.642
- When?
- Last Wednesday.

20:34.025 --> 20:37.643
- Oceanic flight 815?
- Yeah.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.821
Do you mind if I have a look at that?

20:45.912 --> 20:47.618
Sure. Go ahead.

21:06.850 --> 21:08.260
Yeah. Me, too.

21:10.854 --> 21:13.687
Well, it was nice seeing you again.

21:16.818 --> 21:18.308
Thanks for trying to help.

21:20.530 --> 21:23.943
- Where are you staying?
- Just down the road, a motel.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.323
Why don't you come stay with me?

21:28.204 --> 21:29.364
Stay with you?

21:30.874 --> 21:33.411
I mean, we're strangers.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.332
No, we're not strangers. We're...

21:36.463 --> 21:37.703
We're family.

22:02.155 --> 22:05.272
Just 'cause there ain't any goons on the
dock doesn't mean they ain't on the sub.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.781
We're going in hard. Got it?

22:07.869 --> 22:09.780
Lapidus, Hugo, Jin, Sun.
You're with me.

22:09.871 --> 22:13.034
The rest of you wait 30 seconds,
head down the dock behind us.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.699
You think you two can get our backs?

22:20.882 --> 22:21.997
Absolutely.

22:25.386 --> 22:26.717
All right.

22:27.597 --> 22:28.757
Let's go home.

23:07.136 --> 23:09.673
Aft to engine room, power the bilges.

23:09.764 --> 23:11.800
Aft to engine room,
power the bilges, please.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.310
Where's the damn captain?

23:31.619 --> 23:32.995
Put your damn hands up.

23:34.872 --> 23:35.907
Nothin' personal.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.077
OK, hoss, how about you
get ready to fire this thing up?

23:39.836 --> 23:41.246
I got it.

23:45.466 --> 23:46.967
Come on.

24:06.070 --> 24:08.447
You sure you won't reconsider, Jack?

24:09.407 --> 24:11.773
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Whoever told you you needed to stay

24:11.868 --> 24:14.530
had no idea what
they were talking about.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.995
John Locke told me I needed to stay.

24:22.295 --> 24:23.751
What happened?

24:24.922 --> 24:25.911
Kate?!

24:42.899 --> 24:44.890
Claire! Let's go now!

25:17.350 --> 25:19.136
What's going on up there?

25:19.227 --> 25:22.094
- What happened?
- Widmore's people shot her.

25:27.110 --> 25:29.146
Hurley, I need a first aid kit.

25:29.237 --> 25:31.102
- Who else is up there?
- Claire.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.413
Claire!

25:40.039 --> 25:41.495
James!

25:54.387 --> 25:57.424
Lapidus, if you can hear me, dive! Dive!

25:57.515 --> 25:58.504
Let's go!

26:07.483 --> 26:09.644
- Hey! Wait! Wait!
- Claire! Claire, wait!

26:09.736 --> 26:11.397
- Claire! Claire.
- Wait!

26:12.572 --> 26:16.156
- What the hell are you doing?
- What we came here to do... leaving.

26:18.202 --> 26:20.238
- It's all right. It's all right.
- No!

26:20.329 --> 26:22.706
- They're leaving us!
- No, trust me.

26:23.332 --> 26:24.913
You don't want to be on that sub.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.511
Kate.

26:44.437 --> 26:45.677
Claire? Where's Claire?

26:45.772 --> 26:48.263
- She's still up there.
- No, we can't leave without her.

26:48.357 --> 26:50.143
- Kate.
- Is she gonna be OK?

26:50.234 --> 26:52.099
I can't find the first aid kit, dude.

26:53.529 --> 26:57.021
Jin, my pack. There might be a shirt
in there I can use for pressure.

26:57.116 --> 27:00.279
It's OK. Just relax.
Everything's gonna be all right.

27:00.369 --> 27:02.496
Here. Can you help her?

27:02.580 --> 27:04.445
I think the bullet
went straight through.

27:06.751 --> 27:08.116
What?

27:24.644 --> 27:26.054
Dude, where'd that come from?

27:27.104 --> 27:28.264
Locke.

27:30.733 --> 27:32.519
We did exactly what he wanted.

27:41.577 --> 27:44.364
- We have to get to the surface.
- What the hell?

27:44.455 --> 27:45.911
We have to get to the surface now!

27:47.834 --> 27:48.823
Lapidus, take us up.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.577
- We're divin'!
- Just do it!

27:56.217 --> 27:57.798
You heard him. Up!

28:02.723 --> 28:05.339
- Dude, how'd that get on the sub?
- Locke put it in my pack.

28:05.434 --> 28:07.390
Why would he do that?
He wanted to come with us.

28:07.478 --> 28:09.343
Damn right.
That's why I shut his ass out.

28:09.438 --> 28:11.690
He wanted you to shut him out.

28:11.774 --> 28:14.060
Any idea how that thing works?
Can we turn it off?

28:14.151 --> 28:15.812
This watch is jury-rigged
to the battery.

28:15.903 --> 28:20.272
- The battery detonates the explosives.
- How much time till we're up, Frank?

28:21.284 --> 28:22.319
At least five minutes.

28:23.286 --> 28:25.777
We ain't got five minutes.
What's it gonna be, Sayid?

28:25.872 --> 28:29.330
These wires, leads from the watch.
If we disconnect them from the battery,

28:29.417 --> 28:32.124
- technically, the bomb should be inert.
- "Technically"?

28:32.211 --> 28:34.702
You need to pull them out
simultaneously, I'm not sure...

28:34.797 --> 28:36.207
Step aside.

28:36.299 --> 28:38.790
- No, wait. Wait.
- What the hell are you doing, Doc?

28:40.136 --> 28:41.797
Nothing's gonna happen.

28:41.888 --> 28:42.877
What?

28:42.972 --> 28:45.679
Don't pull those wires out.
We're OK. Nothing's gonna happen.

28:45.766 --> 28:48.143
lfl don't pull these wires,
Locke's gonna blow us...

28:48.227 --> 28:51.310
No, he's not! Locke can't kill us.

28:53.858 --> 28:55.644
- What?
- This is what he wanted.

28:55.735 --> 28:58.397
This is what he's been waiting for.
Everything he has done

28:58.487 --> 29:00.068
has been to get us here.

29:00.156 --> 29:02.397
He wanted to get us all
in the same place at the same time.

29:02.491 --> 29:05.449
A nice enclosed space where we
had no hopes of getting out of.

29:05.536 --> 29:06.821
I don't understand.

29:06.913 --> 29:08.995
Locke said he can't leave
the island without us.

29:10.291 --> 29:12.907
I think he can't leave the island
unless we're all dead.

29:14.045 --> 29:16.832
He told me that he could kill
any one of us whenever he wanted,

29:16.923 --> 29:20.507
so what if he hasn't because he's...
he's not allowed to?

29:22.803 --> 29:25.010
What if he's trying to get us
to kill each other?

29:26.098 --> 29:27.429
Stay out of my way, Doc.

29:27.516 --> 29:29.928
If he wanted that to blow up,
why put a timer in it?

29:30.019 --> 29:31.850
- Why not throw it inside?
- I don't care.

29:31.938 --> 29:34.179
- Nothing is gonna happen.
- It's not your decision.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.605
- He can't kill us!
- I'm not gonna stand and do nothing!

29:36.692 --> 29:38.068
James...

29:40.613 --> 29:42.319
We are going to be OK.

29:43.991 --> 29:45.572
You just have to trust me.

29:50.498 --> 29:51.988
Sorry, Doc, I don't.

30:14.021 --> 30:16.103
Listen carefully.
There's a well on the main island

30:16.190 --> 30:18.602
a half mile south
from the camp we just left.

30:18.693 --> 30:21.526
Desmond's inside it.
Locke wants him dead,

30:21.612 --> 30:23.773
which means you're going to need him.
Do you understand me?

30:23.864 --> 30:27.573
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because it's going to be you, Jack.

30:30.204 --> 30:31.193
Sayid!

31:03.446 --> 31:04.811
Hell.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.627
- Are you OK?
- What happened? Did Sayid just...

31:30.306 --> 31:31.671
Help!

31:31.766 --> 31:33.973
- Sun! Wait!
- Help!

31:39.106 --> 31:41.062
Hold on. I'll get you out.

31:42.526 --> 31:45.188
- Sawyer! I need help!
- Jin!

31:46.822 --> 31:47.982
Hurley!

31:49.158 --> 31:51.570
Hurley! You gotta take Kate outta here.

31:51.660 --> 31:54.242
- What about everybody else?
- I'll take care of them!

31:57.500 --> 31:59.741
- l have to go after Sayid!
- There is no Sayid!

32:02.463 --> 32:03.828
Listen to me. Take this tank

32:03.923 --> 32:06.881
and buddy-breathe and swim out
where the blast hole is, OK?

32:06.967 --> 32:10.050
Hurley, you can do this, OK?

32:11.680 --> 32:13.341
- OK.
- Go.

32:19.355 --> 32:20.390
Doc!

32:39.458 --> 32:42.370
On three. One... two... three.

32:55.224 --> 32:57.590
Sawyer! Jack!

33:01.313 --> 33:03.690
Sawyer! Sawyer!

33:12.741 --> 33:14.606
Jin... go.

33:15.411 --> 33:17.276
- No.
- Save yourself.

33:17.371 --> 33:18.736
I'm going to get you out of here.

33:22.543 --> 33:25.034
Go. Go. I'll get her free.

33:25.129 --> 33:26.790
No. We can do this!

33:26.881 --> 33:28.587
Just go! Save Sawyer.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.806
Jin!

33:40.603 --> 33:42.309
Take this. I can get him out without it.

33:42.938 --> 33:44.599
No, you can't, Jack.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.152
Just go.

33:52.948 --> 33:54.063
Go.

34:55.302 --> 34:56.382
Jin.

34:58.597 --> 34:59.928
You have to go.

35:00.015 --> 35:02.222
No, I can do this.

35:02.309 --> 35:04.470
No. No, you can't.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.139
Please go.

35:08.232 --> 35:09.642
I won't leave you.

35:28.752 --> 35:30.288
I'm gonna get you out of here.

35:30.838 --> 35:32.044
No.

35:34.633 --> 35:35.713
Go.

35:36.552 --> 35:39.339
Go. Please.

35:39.430 --> 35:40.795
Go!

35:58.240 --> 35:59.480
I love you, Sun.

37:10.104 --> 37:11.890
ls somebody meeting you, Mr. Locke?

37:11.980 --> 37:13.766
Yes, my fiancee Helen.

37:14.733 --> 37:19.147
She's... probably stuck in traffic.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.487
Hey, I'll take it from here.
I'm pretty good at this.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.983
- Well, best of luck to you, sir.
- Thank you. See ya.

37:26.912 --> 37:28.152
Mr. Locke.

37:29.373 --> 37:33.036
I'm glad I caught ya. I haven't
had a chance to say goodbye yet.

37:33.627 --> 37:34.912
Well, goodbye.

37:35.963 --> 37:37.919
And thanks again, Dr. Shephard.

37:45.806 --> 37:47.342
I went to see your father.

37:50.853 --> 37:52.935
- What?
- When you didn't want the surgery,

37:53.021 --> 37:55.728
I felt like I had to understand why,
and, you know,

37:55.816 --> 37:58.432
I thought that ifl could find out
why you're in this chair,

37:58.527 --> 38:00.313
- that maybe...
- l was in a plane crash.

38:04.950 --> 38:09.535
I had had my private pilot's license
for a week,

38:09.621 --> 38:15.366
and I begged my father
to be my first official passenger.

38:16.545 --> 38:18.376
He was terrified of flying.

38:19.381 --> 38:22.999
But I looked him right in the eye
and I told him he could trust me.

38:25.262 --> 38:27.378
And we barely got off the ground.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.213
I still don't re...

38:31.894 --> 38:36.263
I don't remember what I did wrong,
but it was my fault.

38:36.356 --> 38:39.484
It was my fault that this man,
who I loved more than anything,

38:39.568 --> 38:43.026
will never walk or... talk or...

38:50.454 --> 38:55.073
You know, the first time you and I met,
back at the airport,

38:57.085 --> 38:59.121
you told me that my father was gone,

38:59.880 --> 39:03.748
and it hurt to hear that,
but I knew you were right.

39:07.221 --> 39:08.802
Your father's gone, too, Mr. Locke.

39:08.889 --> 39:11.255
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

39:11.350 --> 39:14.683
Punish yourself as much as you want,
that's never gonna bring him back.

39:17.272 --> 39:20.230
What happened, happened, and...

39:22.236 --> 39:23.225
...you can let it go.

39:25.447 --> 39:27.529
What makes you think
letting go is so easy?

39:28.492 --> 39:29.948
It's not.

39:30.327 --> 39:33.865
In fact, I don't really know
how to do it myself.

39:37.668 --> 39:39.579
And that's why I was hoping that...

39:40.796 --> 39:42.377
...maybe you could go first.

39:52.808 --> 39:54.139
Goodbye, Dr. Shephard.

40:02.651 --> 40:03.811
I can help you, John.

40:06.196 --> 40:07.697
| wish you believed me.

40:45.402 --> 40:46.608
Jack.

40:50.866 --> 40:54.199
I couldn't find you.
I couldn't find you.

40:56.705 --> 40:57.694
Is he OK?

40:58.206 --> 41:00.868
He got hit in the head pretty hard,
but he's breathing.

41:03.253 --> 41:04.584
What about Jin and Sun?

42:00.268 --> 42:01.599
lt sunk.

42:02.896 --> 42:04.352
What, the submarine?

42:06.233 --> 42:09.100
But... they were all on it. Everyone.

42:10.237 --> 42:14.150
- What, they're all dead?
- Not all of them.

42:20.414 --> 42:21.824
Wait. Where you going?

42:21.915 --> 42:23.621
To finish what I started.
