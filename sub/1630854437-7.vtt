00:12.751 --> 00:15.276
I don't need your permission
to assemble.

00:15.363 --> 00:16.973
This isn't for assembling.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.845
This is greeting the President
of the United States.

00:19.932 --> 00:21.978
He's going to endorse Martin.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.636
And don't you ever
call this work!

00:27.723 --> 00:30.160
Governor of Montana
on the side of a mountain,

00:30.247 --> 00:31.553
sleeping with his boots on.

00:34.251 --> 00:36.558
Couldn't have dreamed up
a better death if you paid me.

00:36.645 --> 00:38.995
I can't have Emmett's wife
watch the herd ride in

00:39.082 --> 00:40.562
without him, and no answers.

00:44.522 --> 00:45.784
How?

00:45.871 --> 00:48.091
Like a cowboy should.

00:50.354 --> 00:52.704
Just trying figure out,
what you're doing here?

00:52.791 --> 00:54.880
Here's my ulterior motive.
Do you wanna hear it?

00:54.967 --> 00:57.622
Get you elected governor
and save this state.

00:58.797 --> 01:00.016
One for the road?

01:00.103 --> 01:01.017
Are you stupid enough
to ask me for that

01:01.104 --> 01:02.671
in front of my father?

01:02.758 --> 01:04.368
Be careful.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.066
Careful don't factor
too much into this.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.850
See you when you get back.

01:11.897 --> 01:13.290
You know, I've done some
stupid shit in my life,

01:13.377 --> 01:14.074
but this tops it.

01:16.293 --> 01:17.816
I mean, how the hell are we
supposed to keep wolves

01:17.903 --> 01:20.428
from coming after
5,000 calves?

01:20.515 --> 01:21.994
You ain't gonna stop nothing
sitting by that fire.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.652
I'm gonna ride through 'em.

01:27.739 --> 01:30.699
Yeah, great.
Go save the day, cowboy.

01:34.703 --> 01:37.184
You know, I could be holding
that girl's ass

01:37.271 --> 01:39.534
in each hand,

01:39.621 --> 01:41.536
but no...

01:41.623 --> 01:43.668
I'm sitting here in
a sage brush with you.

01:47.324 --> 01:49.239
What girl?

01:49.326 --> 01:51.067
What do you mean, what girl?

01:55.767 --> 01:57.726
The one you couldn't keep.

02:03.819 --> 02:04.950
What are you gonna do,
half pint?

02:30.324 --> 02:31.716
You never mention her name.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.109
You don't touch her.

02:33.196 --> 02:34.197
You don't fucking talk
to her, you understand?

02:56.045 --> 02:57.525
Try to stab me,
you fucking coward?

03:18.372 --> 03:20.330
Try it again and I will shoot
you where you stand.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.675
Here.

04:05.375 --> 04:06.463
You should drink some water.

04:09.423 --> 04:13.470
It hurts...
Head's spinning.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.907
Maybe next time you won't
pull a knife in a fist fight.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.439
Here, try to drink something.

04:42.107 --> 04:43.457
I'm hurt bad.

04:46.024 --> 04:46.982
You need to go
to the hospital?

04:49.376 --> 04:50.420
I think so.

04:51.682 --> 04:53.728
- Can you ride?
- Yeah.

05:01.997 --> 05:03.172
I'll go get help.

05:06.741 --> 05:09.570
Tell 'em I fell off my horse

05:09.657 --> 05:10.527
and he trampled me.

05:13.748 --> 05:14.792
Or you'll get in
a lot of trouble.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.223
Rowdy's hurt.
Hurt bad.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.181
Where is he?

05:56.268 --> 05:57.357
With the cattle.

05:57.444 --> 05:58.923
Hurt too bad to ride he says.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.142
He get bucked off?

06:03.275 --> 06:04.538
Rip, did he get bucked off?

06:06.757 --> 06:10.805
No sir, he talked
about your daughter

06:10.892 --> 06:14.112
in a way he shouldn't
and we fought about it.

06:14.199 --> 06:17.551
He pulled his knife and I hit
him in the head with a rock.

06:17.638 --> 06:18.639
Too hard, I guess...

06:22.469 --> 06:23.426
You wait here.

06:38.789 --> 06:39.964
Here, give it to me.

06:43.272 --> 06:44.273
Here you go.

06:47.276 --> 06:49.496
- He's dead.
- He's dead?

06:53.543 --> 06:55.284
That ain't gonna help.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.373
Get down off that horse.

07:04.902 --> 07:06.730
Why didn't you just tell me
he fell off his horse?

07:06.817 --> 07:09.733
That's what Rowdy said.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.648
You said never lie to you

07:11.735 --> 07:13.128
so, I didn't.

07:16.784 --> 07:19.482
Well, you're
gonna have to lie now.

07:19.569 --> 07:20.570
Or you're going to prison, son.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.880
Rowdy ain't got no family.
He's just a drifter.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.795
We could drop him off
at the train station.

07:27.882 --> 07:30.014
That's putting a lot
of trust in this boy.

07:30.101 --> 07:31.799
Boy's putting a
fair amount in us, too.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.066
Quit fucking crying.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.459
The time to worry
about consequences

07:39.546 --> 07:40.547
was before the fight.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.073
There's a thing I could do,

07:45.160 --> 07:48.555
but if I do it, you don't
ever leave this place.

07:48.642 --> 07:51.427
You'll be part of this ranch
until the day you die,

07:51.514 --> 07:54.299
and you will do for
this ranch what I say do.

07:56.127 --> 07:59.130
No matter what that is...

07:59.217 --> 07:59.957
you understand me?

08:03.787 --> 08:06.877
This ranch is
the only family I've got.

08:06.964 --> 08:09.489
Ain't ever leaving it
no matter what you do.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.063
All right.

08:21.239 --> 08:22.589
Come help me.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.498
This was not what
I was supposed to be.

09:48.849 --> 09:51.591
I was... I was...

09:53.680 --> 09:55.072
I was raised to be a cowboy.

09:57.727 --> 10:01.601
To... to run a ranch. To...

10:01.688 --> 10:04.212
To know the nuances
of being a cattle producer.

10:07.476 --> 10:10.610
To... You know,
from, from...

10:10.697 --> 10:12.437
from understanding
the grass cycles,

10:12.524 --> 10:15.136
to... to timing
the calving season

10:15.223 --> 10:18.139
to maximize the grass cycles.

10:18.226 --> 10:20.358
Understanding bull genetics
and diseases.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.711
It was...

10:24.798 --> 10:27.148
I never wanted to be
a fucking lawyer.

10:27.235 --> 10:30.238
This is what he wanted
me to be.

10:30.325 --> 10:32.153
What he thought he needed.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.634
"The future of warfare
is fought with a pen.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.810
Learn to fight with a pen."

10:36.897 --> 10:38.463
All right.
So, I did.

10:39.943 --> 10:41.684
And I did.

10:41.771 --> 10:45.079
And then I get this acceptance
letter from Harvard

10:45.166 --> 10:47.908
Hell, I never even applied.

10:47.995 --> 10:51.041
He applied for me.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.784
There's no telling who
wrote the fucking essay.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.438
Your sister, I would think.

10:58.962 --> 11:01.965
Never thought of that.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.837
God, why didn't
I think of that?

11:03.924 --> 11:06.230
Because you're
too close to it.

11:06.317 --> 11:09.843
My father hates me.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.627
Hates me.

11:11.714 --> 11:14.761
He hates me for
becoming the very thing

11:14.848 --> 11:16.414
he asked me to become.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.939
No, forced me to be.

11:19.026 --> 11:21.115
Do you care
that he hates you?

11:21.202 --> 11:23.421
Is his love something
you feel you really need?

11:23.508 --> 11:26.686
Evidently not. I've lived
without it my whole life.

11:26.773 --> 11:32.039
But I would like
his approval.

11:32.126 --> 11:35.651
I want his appreciation
for that fucking sacrifice.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.566
He can't give you that.

11:37.653 --> 11:41.048
He resents the tool
that he relies on the most,

11:41.135 --> 11:43.833
because he can't
be that tool.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.314
He's jealous of you, Jamie.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.185
And he's scared of you.

11:48.272 --> 11:50.622
He's scared because
the future of that ranch

11:50.710 --> 11:52.929
depends on its evolution.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.844
If it doesn't evolve
with society

11:54.931 --> 11:57.325
it will be devoured
by society

11:57.412 --> 12:00.807
I know, I know.
I've said that for years.

12:00.894 --> 12:03.070
Decades.

12:03.157 --> 12:05.202
And he's still running
cow-calf pairs

12:05.289 --> 12:07.814
like it's the 1950s, when
cow-calf pairs in the 1950s

12:07.901 --> 12:09.424
didn't even make
any money.

12:09.511 --> 12:10.904
Cattle.

12:10.991 --> 12:13.994
Let me tell you the future
of the cattle industry.

12:14.081 --> 12:17.258
Right now, the biggest
meat processor

12:17.345 --> 12:21.741
in the United States
is a Brazilian Corporation.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.786
10,000 acres of rainforest
cleared every day.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.483
For what?
To raise cattle.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.224
Is that a coincidence?

12:27.311 --> 12:29.444
The future of the beef industry
in the United States

12:29.531 --> 12:31.402
is no future.
- Mm-mm

12:31.489 --> 12:35.667
In twenty years Brazil
will be to American beef

12:35.755 --> 12:37.844
what China is to
American manufacturing.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.802
There will be no
more cattle in America.

12:39.889 --> 12:41.021
That's why
the airport development

12:41.108 --> 12:43.284
was vital to the ranch's future.

12:43.371 --> 12:44.633
You don't have
to tell me that.

12:44.720 --> 12:48.158
Mm-mm.

12:48.245 --> 12:52.075
But you do have to tell
the rest of Montana.

12:52.162 --> 12:55.078
Tourism is Montana's
only resource.

12:55.165 --> 12:57.602
What else do you
have, timber?

12:57.689 --> 13:00.344
Cutting down something it
takes 200 years to replace?

13:00.431 --> 13:05.132
That is not a business.
That is self mutilation.

13:05.219 --> 13:07.569
No. Tourism.
That is all you have.

13:07.656 --> 13:11.791
And you can seize it
or you can witness it.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.575
Those are your options.

13:15.359 --> 13:16.404
I know.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.234
You love that ranch.

13:22.192 --> 13:25.369
It's the only thing
I've ever loved.

13:25.456 --> 13:28.329
Let me help you save it.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.418
I can help you save it
if you want me to.

13:30.505 --> 13:31.506
I do.

13:32.942 --> 13:34.596
Ask me, then.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.992
Ask me to help you
save it.

13:41.777 --> 13:42.996
Will you help me?

13:48.523 --> 13:49.263
Help me.

13:53.093 --> 13:54.572
I will help you, baby.

13:56.618 --> 13:57.227

this is my favorite.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.174
Well, I prefer
when it's done.

18:08.261 --> 18:10.001
And everything went smooth.

18:12.656 --> 18:14.441

- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.311
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.836

19:01.923 --> 19:03.316
You're sitting here, too.

19:03.403 --> 19:04.665
I doubt you just wandered down

19:04.752 --> 19:06.188
from the house
to take in the view.

19:06.275 --> 19:08.277
Yeah, well,
I'm a married woman.

19:08.364 --> 19:10.497
But you tramps...
- Ah, yes.

19:10.584 --> 19:12.760
That arcane ritual
where you stand

19:12.847 --> 19:17.460
before family and friends
and swear before God deity

19:17.547 --> 19:19.767
that you will surrender
your independence

19:19.854 --> 19:23.074
and obey the man you are
betrothed to.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.686
Betrothed?

19:25.773 --> 19:28.210
See, what Summer's
is attempting to do here

19:28.297 --> 19:31.170
is make out that marriage
is designed to somehow

19:31.257 --> 19:33.084
oppress and control a woman.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.217
You know, if you married to
a piece of shit, it can be,

19:35.304 --> 19:38.089
but if you married the love
of your life,

19:38.177 --> 19:40.701
the mirror to your soul,
it's pretty fucking great.

19:42.659 --> 19:44.095
I thought we agreed
to get along.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.706
We did. I didn't agree
to placate

19:45.793 --> 19:48.491
some of your hippie bullshit
where every institution

19:48.578 --> 19:50.798
and every custom
is designed to oppress.

19:50.885 --> 19:52.016
They are.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.629
They are what you make
em, babe.

19:55.716 --> 19:57.587
I'm going
to get a shower.

19:57.674 --> 20:00.938
You could probably use one.

20:01.025 --> 20:02.766
- Are there showers here?
- Yeah, in the bunkhouse.

20:02.853 --> 20:03.724
I'll show you.

20:09.164 --> 20:10.383
What?

20:10.470 --> 20:12.472
Just waiting
for another zinger.

20:12.559 --> 20:14.256
I'm all zinged out for now.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.309
Why are you so mean?

20:24.962 --> 20:26.486
No reason.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.837
It's fun.

20:29.924 --> 20:31.621
That's fun for you?

20:31.708 --> 20:34.363
What, to point out the very
thing that everyone's thinking

20:34.450 --> 20:36.844
but they don't have the spine
to own it and say?

20:36.931 --> 20:39.542
"Yeah, damn right I romped
in the tent all night.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.979
You should try it."
Which I did.

20:42.066 --> 20:43.372
Most of the night.

20:43.459 --> 20:46.723
Yes, I find that amusing.

20:46.810 --> 20:47.855
Well, I think it's cruel.

20:49.770 --> 20:50.945
Well, that's why I don't
do it to you.

20:52.860 --> 20:56.603
Those cowgirls, they give
as good as they get

20:56.690 --> 21:01.521
and that patchouli-scented
know it all, well, she needs it.

21:01.608 --> 21:02.435
You don't need it.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.222
Well, I don't need to
be treated differently

21:07.309 --> 21:09.137
just because I lost a child.

21:11.661 --> 21:12.445
Yeah, you do.

21:18.581 --> 21:19.930
I'm gonna tell you something...

21:25.371 --> 21:27.808
I haven't told anybody so,
let's keep this between us.

21:30.419 --> 21:31.420
Okay.

21:38.122 --> 21:40.342
I know how you feel
because I've felt it.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.303
And I feel it every day.

21:47.175 --> 21:49.308
So when I say that
I am sorry, Monica...

21:52.659 --> 21:53.399
I really mean it.

22:02.538 --> 22:03.670
Thank you.

22:13.070 --> 22:14.245
That's why you're mean.

22:15.290 --> 22:17.640
Because nobody knows.

22:17.727 --> 22:19.555
Because you keep
that inside yourself.

22:21.078 --> 22:24.255
I keep it inside
because of...

22:24.343 --> 22:26.475
all the people knowing it
would hurt.

22:32.742 --> 22:35.615
Anyway, that's not
why I'm mean.

22:35.702 --> 22:37.530
I was a real fucking bitch
before it happened, so...

22:40.576 --> 22:43.013
Well...
You're very good at it.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.667
I try.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.687
Chairman Rainwater,
right this way.

23:10.084 --> 23:12.303
Chairman Rainwater is here.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.740
Thanks.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.394
- Tom.
- Senator.

23:15.481 --> 23:16.525
Thanks for coming.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.397
Please, sit.

23:18.484 --> 23:19.659
Either of you like coffee?

23:19.746 --> 23:21.530
Well, I'm too curious
for coffee.

23:21.617 --> 23:22.836
Well, I'll get
right to it, then.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.968
The Department of Interior
has approved

23:25.055 --> 23:28.102
two pipelines
in central Montana.

23:28.189 --> 23:31.845
One is a natural gas, and
the other is captured carbon

23:31.932 --> 23:34.500
and the proposed pathway
is through the reservation.

23:38.721 --> 23:40.506
The Secretary of the Interior
was here

23:40.593 --> 23:42.725
with the President
two days ago.

23:42.812 --> 23:44.553
They mentioned nothing.

23:44.640 --> 23:48.122
As I'm learning,
Federal politics is, well,

23:48.209 --> 23:51.865
they never take the gloves off
because they never put them on.

23:51.952 --> 23:53.519
Is there a map
of this pathway?

24:02.005 --> 24:03.833
The pipeline runs
beneath our reservoir.

24:03.920 --> 24:04.921
Yes.

24:07.315 --> 24:09.099
Our drinking water.

24:09.186 --> 24:10.492
Yes.

24:10.579 --> 24:11.885
How is the path chosen?

24:11.972 --> 24:13.364
Well, it's the
shortest distance between

24:13.452 --> 24:16.890
two points and the path
of least legal resistance.

24:16.977 --> 24:20.328
To go to the west of you enters
into State land forest service,

24:20.415 --> 24:23.505
east of you is private ranches,
which have the funds to fight,

24:23.592 --> 24:25.507
and likely the support
of our new governor.

24:25.594 --> 24:26.813
They don't think
we'll put up a fight?

24:26.900 --> 24:28.728
We can't put up a fight.

24:28.815 --> 24:30.686
Federal Government doesn't
need our permission.

24:30.773 --> 24:33.689
So that my position is clear,
I do not support this.

24:33.776 --> 24:36.083
And I will declare
my opposition,

24:36.170 --> 24:39.478
how much weight that holds
in this instance... I...

24:39.565 --> 24:41.044
If there's nothing
you can do

24:41.131 --> 24:43.699
and there's nothing I can do,
why are you telling me?

24:43.786 --> 24:46.180
Because I know who's
coming after your office

24:46.267 --> 24:47.877
and they'll use
this against you.

24:47.964 --> 24:51.359
At least now, make a statement,
get out in front of it.

24:51.446 --> 24:53.404
Make enough noise that
the Department of Interior

24:53.492 --> 24:55.450
looks somewhere else.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.017
North Dakota, let's say.

24:57.104 --> 24:59.541
That just ruins the land
in North Dakota.

24:59.628 --> 25:02.762
I'm not the Senator
of North Dakota.

25:02.849 --> 25:04.241
So that's
North Dakota's problem.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.116
I guess you don't
put gloves on either.

25:13.599 --> 25:16.036
When will you publicly
declare your opposition?

25:16.123 --> 25:17.428
As soon as the pipeline
is made public,

25:17.516 --> 25:20.127
which I assume is when
you'll call a press conference.

25:20.214 --> 25:21.781
You set the press conference.

25:21.868 --> 25:23.783
Stand with the people
this affects.

25:23.870 --> 25:25.611
Standing beside you
in solidarity

25:25.698 --> 25:27.656
is declaring
my support for you

25:27.743 --> 25:29.832
as much as it is
opposing a pipeline.

25:29.919 --> 25:31.442
We'll kill two birds
with one stone.

25:36.404 --> 25:37.448
Deal.

25:39.538 --> 25:43.150
I'll set it for tomorrow.

25:43.237 --> 25:44.891
Be good to have
the governor there.

25:44.978 --> 25:46.327
Well, the governor's
playing hooky.

25:46.414 --> 25:47.633
Branding cattle.

25:49.373 --> 25:51.114
That's not what
he was elected to do.

25:51.201 --> 25:52.855
Oh, he did what
he was elected to do.

25:52.942 --> 25:53.900
That's the way John
sees it, anyway.

25:55.728 --> 25:57.817
He's our governor, too.

25:57.904 --> 25:59.862
Perhaps you could remind
him of that.

26:13.354 --> 26:14.834
Hup, hup.

26:18.446 --> 26:19.795
Sh-sh-sh-sh...

26:27.281 --> 26:28.064
Damn, Lloyd.

26:28.151 --> 26:29.588
What?

26:29.675 --> 26:31.285
That's the third one
I've seen.

26:31.372 --> 26:33.766
- One what?
- Stillborn buffalo calf.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.943
- Where?
- Just right back there.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.753
Aw, shit, this ain't
gonna be good.

27:09.715 --> 27:12.065
Buffalo from the park
been in this pasture.

27:12.152 --> 27:16.069
Found two dead bison calves
there, stillborn.

27:16.156 --> 27:18.332
Walker said he's
seen two more of 'em.

27:21.944 --> 27:24.730
Let me guess,
you found a stillborn bison.

27:24.817 --> 27:27.080
Two.

27:27.167 --> 27:29.386
Why would that happen?

27:29.473 --> 27:31.258
Brucellosis, Clara.

27:33.564 --> 27:35.131
Found something
you're going to want to see.

27:35.218 --> 27:37.917
We found it, too.

27:38.004 --> 27:40.659
Can cattle get it?

27:40.746 --> 27:41.790
Yes, cattle can get it.

27:41.877 --> 27:43.487
Well, how can you tell?

27:43.574 --> 27:45.228
Well, we'll test
them for it.

27:45.315 --> 27:49.624
And if one cow has it, the state
destroys the whole herd.

27:52.018 --> 27:54.324
All our cows have calves.

27:54.411 --> 27:56.370
We're not going to solve
this on the side of the hill.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.285
Let's get em to headquarters.

watching, but I can't stop.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.350
It's riveting.

30:32.265 --> 30:34.223

30:57.116 --> 30:58.160
You ever seen
one with blackleg?

30:58.247 --> 30:59.118
- No.
- That's traumatizing.

30:59.205 --> 31:00.684
You are doing
the calf a big favor.

31:00.771 --> 31:01.685
And if you could do
that favor a little faster.

31:01.772 --> 31:03.774

- Okay, set?
- Yep.

31:22.576 --> 31:26.623
If the state kills the herd,
do they pay you back?

31:26.710 --> 31:28.756
Not what it's worth.

31:28.843 --> 31:32.542
The herd's insured but...
I don't know.

31:32.629 --> 31:35.110
I don't know how we rebuild
a hundred years of genetics.

31:35.197 --> 31:37.373
Look, if one of
them tests positive,

31:37.460 --> 31:40.246
there's nothing we can do.
Start over, I guess.

31:40.333 --> 31:44.424
But if they don't,
we got a bigger problem.

31:44.511 --> 31:47.035
We can't use that south pasture.

31:47.122 --> 31:48.428
There's fifty miles
of fence to check,

31:48.515 --> 31:50.909
that lower valley's too dry,
they got nothing to eat.

31:50.996 --> 31:53.563
We wean early, send the calves
to a back grounding yard

31:53.650 --> 31:54.738
in Nebraska, or--

31:54.825 --> 31:56.088
The trucking will
kill us, Kayce,

31:56.175 --> 31:57.828
and we're already paying
a gain on top of it.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.352
What about hayin' 'em?

31:59.439 --> 32:01.571
Yeah, and feed em
with what in the winter?

32:03.704 --> 32:05.140
Son of a bitch.

32:07.577 --> 32:10.885
Look, I'll, um...
I'll start making some calls.

32:10.972 --> 32:12.582
Find us some lease ground.

32:15.629 --> 32:20.764
To make this pencil out
half the herd needs to go

32:20.851 --> 32:23.158
and it needs to stay
a year or more.

32:23.245 --> 32:24.507
Lease ground where?

32:24.594 --> 32:25.900
Somewhere with a mild winter.

32:31.340 --> 32:32.907
If half the herd goes,
who watches 'em?

32:32.994 --> 32:34.822
Who do you think, Kayce?

32:52.622 --> 32:53.406
Lloyd.

33:01.153 --> 33:05.113
Well, what's the plan?

33:05.200 --> 33:07.028
Mister Dutton
wants to lease land down south

33:07.115 --> 33:08.160
and get the herd out.

33:10.727 --> 33:12.033
I'll go with the herd.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.209
Who else you gonna take?

33:14.296 --> 33:16.777
I don't know.
Who you want to stay here?

33:16.864 --> 33:19.606
Hell, you're the one living
out of a teepee in new country,

33:19.693 --> 33:21.173
you take who you want.

33:21.260 --> 33:22.783
All right.

33:22.870 --> 33:25.525
I'll go with Jake,

33:25.612 --> 33:28.963
Teeter, Ryan...

33:29.050 --> 33:30.965
and hell, I'll take Walker.

33:31.052 --> 33:32.314
You ain't gonna
kill him

33:32.401 --> 33:34.577
out there on the plains
somewhere, are you?

33:34.664 --> 33:36.840
We're probably going
to his old stomping ground,

33:36.927 --> 33:39.365
I might need someone that
knows some folks down there.

33:39.452 --> 33:40.931
By the way,
I'm more fucking worried

33:41.019 --> 33:42.542
about you killing his ass.

33:42.629 --> 33:44.326
My memory's not as
mean as yours.

33:45.632 --> 33:47.851
You're gonna be a long
way from home.

33:47.938 --> 33:49.853
Long way from your wife.

33:49.940 --> 33:53.031
I ain't got nobody,
you oughta send me.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.250
I'm ranch manager, Lloyd.

33:55.337 --> 33:58.036
It's my responsibility.
I appreciate it, though.

33:58.123 --> 33:59.341
Well, when you
are you leaving?

33:59.428 --> 34:01.213
Soon as Mr. Dutton
signs the lease

34:01.300 --> 34:02.649
and I get the trucks lined up.

34:02.736 --> 34:05.086
- You're gonna need Gator.
- Go tell him, will ya?

34:10.135 --> 34:13.225
Jake. Walker.

34:13.312 --> 34:14.965
Ryan. Teeter.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.054
Get over here.

34:18.230 --> 34:19.535
All right, listen up.

34:19.622 --> 34:21.102
After we brand these cattle,

34:21.189 --> 34:22.712
we're going to hold them here,

34:22.799 --> 34:23.887
then we're gonna
put them on trucks,

34:23.974 --> 34:25.933
we're going to take them
to lease ground.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.153
You four are
coming with me.

34:28.240 --> 34:29.980
We're gonna get some day workers
when we get down there.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.722
- Where?
- I don't know.

34:32.809 --> 34:35.377
Somewhere where it doesn't
snow in the winter.

34:35.464 --> 34:36.770
Go and pack up
everything you got.

34:36.857 --> 34:39.251
Your teepees, all of it.

34:39.338 --> 34:40.339
We'll be gone for a while.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.430
What are you smiling about?

34:44.517 --> 34:46.519
Gonna go do some
cowboy shit now.

34:46.606 --> 34:49.261
You keep that bunkhouse
and cable TV.

34:49.348 --> 34:50.392
Thanks for picking us, boss.

34:50.479 --> 34:51.219
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

34:51.306 --> 34:52.351
You got it.

34:58.270 --> 35:00.446
Ryan.

35:00.533 --> 35:01.316
I want you to tell
me right now

35:01.403 --> 35:03.449
if this is going
to be a problem.

35:03.536 --> 35:06.365
I don't want to hear about it
in some canyon in New Mexico.

35:06.452 --> 35:08.584
There's nothin' I'd rather do.

35:08.671 --> 35:10.717
Sir, thank you for the chance.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.327
You got it.

35:12.414 --> 35:14.416
Ryan, Ryan,
hold on a second.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.855
Why don't you take
the bunkhouse to the fair.

35:18.942 --> 35:21.510
You go have some fun.

35:21.597 --> 35:22.946
You ain't gonna see
a town in a long while.

35:23.904 --> 35:24.948
Thank you.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.227
That's Swarovski crystal, Dad.

35:42.314 --> 35:43.967
Swarovski makes optics, honey.

35:44.054 --> 35:46.013
With the glass from their
crystal factory.

35:46.100 --> 35:47.101
Yeah, well, I need
to break something.

35:47.188 --> 35:48.276
That is a hundred years old

35:48.363 --> 35:49.059
and belonged
to your grandfather.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.800
Break something else.

36:04.162 --> 36:07.034
Need to move our herd
down south.

36:07.121 --> 36:08.905
Buffalo herd left the park.

36:08.992 --> 36:10.472
Spent spring on our ranch.

36:10.559 --> 36:12.561
Herd has brucellosis now.

36:12.648 --> 36:15.564
That sounds ominous.

36:15.651 --> 36:17.349
It is.

36:17.436 --> 36:19.960
How far south?

36:20.047 --> 36:21.309
Far enough that
it doesn't snow,

36:21.396 --> 36:22.963
so we don't have
to feed them all winter.

36:23.050 --> 36:26.271
Okay, so do you
have to lease the land?

36:26.358 --> 36:29.317
- Yeah.
- And how much will that cost?

36:29.404 --> 36:35.018
Dry as it is? I don't know.
12, 14 dollars an acre.

36:35.105 --> 36:36.933
Okay, how many acres?

36:37.020 --> 36:40.807
Depends on the land.

36:40.894 --> 36:43.070
Hundred thousand at least.

36:43.157 --> 36:46.813
So that's
1.4 million dollars a year.

36:46.900 --> 36:50.382
No, Beth.

36:50.469 --> 36:53.472
1.4 a month.

36:58.172 --> 37:00.000
Dad, we don't...

37:00.087 --> 37:01.741
We don't have that.

37:01.828 --> 37:05.701
I know.
I'll take a loan.

37:05.788 --> 37:09.662
Why don't you
just sell them all now?

37:09.749 --> 37:11.707
If we sell 'em all now,
we have no income next year.

37:11.794 --> 37:14.319
We don't have any
income this year.

37:14.406 --> 37:15.842
We have no profit this year.

37:15.929 --> 37:17.409
We have no profit <i>any</i> year.

37:22.196 --> 37:23.328
Now I want to break shit.

37:31.118 --> 37:34.164
If we sell the heifers and
the steers, what is that worth?

37:34.252 --> 37:38.473
If I can get them to weigh
750, worth about 1100 dollars.

37:38.560 --> 37:43.957
Okay, so that's
a $1.50 a pound, Dad.

37:44.044 --> 37:47.003
Yep.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.223
A good steak is worth
thirty bucks a pound,

37:49.310 --> 37:51.443
shitty ground beef
is worth five.

37:51.530 --> 37:55.055
We don't sell beef,
we sell cattle.

37:55.142 --> 37:57.187
Exactly. We're in the wrong
fucking business.

37:59.973 --> 38:01.931
You know, I really, uh...

38:02.018 --> 38:06.849
I really thought
the airport would be
the end of us, Dad, but...

38:06.936 --> 38:09.199
Your business model,
is gonna be the end of us.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.419
Business model's
worked for a hundred years--

38:11.506 --> 38:14.117
No, Dad, it hasn't worked.

38:14.204 --> 38:16.424
If it worked, this fucking
valley wouldn't be filled

38:16.511 --> 38:19.732
with hobby farms
and vacation houses.

38:19.819 --> 38:21.516
It would be filled with ranches.

38:26.826 --> 38:29.307
People don't sell businesses
that make money, right?

38:29.394 --> 38:31.352
They sell the losers.

38:55.855 --> 38:58.814
Randy, John Dutton.
How are ya?

38:58.901 --> 39:00.033
You all stocked up?

39:02.688 --> 39:03.689
Yeah, I need some ground.

39:05.952 --> 39:07.823
Five thousand
if I can find the grass.

39:12.785 --> 39:13.873
Yeah, I know him.

39:16.136 --> 39:18.007
Who else if that doesn't work?

39:29.715 --> 39:32.370
Oh, um, Ellis Steele is in
your office with Miss Atwood.

39:33.893 --> 39:36.548
Sarah?

39:36.635 --> 39:38.332
That's weird.

39:38.419 --> 39:39.464
Can I say something, that's...

39:40.813 --> 39:43.946
That I don't have
a right to say?

39:44.033 --> 39:45.078
Sure?

39:45.165 --> 39:47.907
Women know women.

39:47.994 --> 39:51.040
Men know what a woman
wants them to know.

39:51.127 --> 39:52.651
I worry about
you being with her.

39:54.435 --> 39:57.220
Oh, I'm not--

39:57.307 --> 39:58.874
Who told you I was with her?

40:00.223 --> 40:01.224
You're with her.

40:06.708 --> 40:08.057
Thank you for
saying something.

40:08.144 --> 40:09.537
I'll keep it in mind.

40:18.024 --> 40:20.330
This is...

40:20.418 --> 40:22.768
Unexpected.

40:22.855 --> 40:25.684
Um...

40:25.771 --> 40:27.860
What's on your mind,
Mr. Steele?

40:27.947 --> 40:28.687
This.

40:31.820 --> 40:34.388
Your father put his ranch
in the Land Trust.

40:35.998 --> 40:39.524
He put the land in a
conservation easement, Jamie.

40:39.611 --> 40:41.961
How could you
let him do that?

40:42.048 --> 40:43.963
Well, I...

40:45.791 --> 40:47.488
I...

40:47.575 --> 40:49.882
I didn't know.

40:49.969 --> 40:51.449
Do you have the authority
to override that?

40:53.668 --> 40:55.714
Theoretically, yes,

40:57.063 --> 40:58.717
But...

40:58.804 --> 40:59.848
You're not battling
a man, anymore,

40:59.935 --> 41:02.285
you're battling the legal
defense funds

41:02.372 --> 41:05.419
of environmental groups,

41:05.506 --> 41:09.684
which had no basis to sue you,

41:09.771 --> 41:12.600
but now they are
the stewards of the--

41:12.687 --> 41:14.994
fuck!

41:15.081 --> 41:16.561
God damn it!

41:21.827 --> 41:23.437
Thank you for coming.

41:23.524 --> 41:24.699
I'm going to need some time
to process this information.

41:43.892 --> 41:45.546
Market Equity will
sue the state

41:45.633 --> 41:48.462
for a bad faith negotiation.

41:48.549 --> 41:50.551
They will file it in
federal court in New York,

41:50.638 --> 41:51.944
where they incurred the damages,

41:52.031 --> 41:55.034
and those attorneys will
wipe the floor with you.

41:55.121 --> 41:56.601
Your state will be on
the hook

41:56.688 --> 42:00.039
for around 4 billion dollars
in compensatory damages.

42:00.126 --> 42:02.694
That's ten percent
of Montana's GDP.

42:02.781 --> 42:04.565
The state's gonna go bankrupt.

42:21.582 --> 42:23.584
Sounds like an
impeachable offense to me.

42:28.328 --> 42:29.503
Yes, it does.

42:31.810 --> 42:34.682
What's the procedure
in Montana

42:34.769 --> 42:36.902
when a Governor resigns
or steps down?

42:42.211 --> 42:44.083
You have a special election.

42:52.395 --> 42:56.312
We're fully committed
to your election.

42:56.399 --> 42:57.662
Our PAC will fund it.

43:00.490 --> 43:02.623
Go before the Assembly.

43:05.844 --> 43:07.585
This is your chance
to become governor...

43:12.546 --> 43:14.200
and get our fucking land back.

43:37.397 --> 43:38.703
<i>Supply House.</i>

43:38.790 --> 43:40.052
Is this the number
to order beef?

43:40.139 --> 43:43.055
<i>Yes, ma'am,
or you can do it online.</i>

43:43.142 --> 43:44.622
Can I be nosey?

43:44.709 --> 43:48.190
<i>Umm, sure.</i>

43:48.277 --> 43:52.630
Is this your beef, that you
raise and sell online?

43:52.717 --> 43:54.196
<i>Yes, ma'am. Some comes
from neighboring ranchers</i>

43:54.283 --> 43:55.633
<i>'cause we sell out of all ours,</i>

43:55.720 --> 43:57.243
<i>but they follow
the same program.</i>

43:57.330 --> 43:58.810
You sell out?

43:58.897 --> 44:00.115
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

44:02.988 --> 44:04.990
How many pounds
of beef do you raise?

44:05.077 --> 44:07.035
<i>This year, a little
over 8 million.</i>

44:13.259 --> 44:14.347
What's the catch?

44:14.434 --> 44:16.001
<i>Ma'am?</i>

44:16.088 --> 44:17.480
There's always a catch.

44:17.567 --> 44:19.265
<i>No catch.</i>

44:19.352 --> 44:20.788
<i>You just gotta have enough
money to feed your herd</i>

44:20.875 --> 44:22.398
<i>for two years before
you make any money.</i>

44:22.485 --> 44:24.183
<i>Or get a big loan.</i>

44:24.270 --> 44:25.967
<i>And have a lot
of backbone, ma'am.</i>

44:26.054 --> 44:29.362
Backbone we got, thank you.

44:43.245 --> 44:44.856
Joe, I can't
thank you enough.

44:46.945 --> 44:48.773
Once I get the trucks lined up
I'll start sending 'em your way.

44:52.124 --> 44:53.603
This is what you
get your loan for.

44:56.041 --> 44:57.695
The cash flow
is impossible, honey,

44:57.782 --> 44:59.740
and nobody can figure
out the packer.

44:59.827 --> 45:01.655
They figured out the packer.

45:01.742 --> 45:03.439
Do you know this ranch?

45:03.526 --> 45:06.312
Yeah, I was just on
the phone with this ranch.

45:06.399 --> 45:08.488
So was I.

45:08.575 --> 45:12.318
They sold 8 million
pounds of beef.

45:12.405 --> 45:14.363
On a website.

45:14.450 --> 45:15.669
I don't know what their
arrangement is honey,

45:15.756 --> 45:18.237
but one thing I do know is...

45:18.324 --> 45:23.372
nobody has ever been able
to figure out the re-packer.

45:23.459 --> 45:27.289
That is because you are not
a businessman, Daddy.

45:27.376 --> 45:28.638
You are a rancher.

45:28.726 --> 45:31.163
I am a businessman.

45:31.250 --> 45:34.079
And I have spent my
career making

45:34.166 --> 45:36.734
fifty, hundred million
dollar deals for others.

45:38.431 --> 45:40.085
Now I'm gonna make one for you.

45:44.437 --> 45:46.352
Sir?

45:46.439 --> 45:47.614
Line up the trucks.

45:47.701 --> 45:49.007
They're lined up.

45:49.094 --> 45:50.922
We just need to know
where they're headed.

45:51.009 --> 45:53.881
Ground in Eastern Colorado and
north of Panhandle in Texas.

45:53.968 --> 45:57.667
Okay. Sweetheart...

45:57.755 --> 46:00.018
Don't bite my head off
for asking this question.

46:00.105 --> 46:01.541
I don't like the way
this is starting.

46:01.628 --> 46:03.369
Me either...

46:03.456 --> 46:07.373
Um... Would you like to come
to the fair with me?

46:07.460 --> 46:10.071
Sure, when?

No, no. It's the fair.
It's the county fair.

46:23.432 --> 46:28.786
It's been happening
for the last 92 years, sir.

46:28.873 --> 46:29.917

I'm really enjoying it.

58:30.507 --> 58:32.813
I didn't...

58:32.900 --> 58:37.252
I did not kidnap you--I commuted
your sentence to house arrest.

58:37.339 --> 58:39.124
At your house.

58:40.691 --> 58:44.085
I guess in the narrowest
of legal interpretations

58:44.172 --> 58:46.348
maybe...

58:46.435 --> 58:47.175
you're right.

The actions of Governor Dutton
have not only robbed Montanans

1:00:06.472 --> 1:00:10.302
of six thousand jobs and
annual revenue in the billions,

1:00:10.389 --> 1:00:12.913
his actions have exposed
Montana to litigation

1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:15.524
that will cost
the state billions more,

1:00:15.612 --> 1:00:17.309
likely bankrupting the state.

1:00:17.396 --> 1:00:19.746
Which robs your
children of school funding,

1:00:19.833 --> 1:00:22.357
robs our towns
of emergency services,

1:00:22.444 --> 1:00:25.622
places our roads and
infrastructure in disrepair.

1:00:25.709 --> 1:00:29.800
It threatens the quality
of life for all Montanans.
