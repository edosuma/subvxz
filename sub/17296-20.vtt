00:46.307 --> 00:47.786
It is getting away.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.798
It's too fast.

01:02.627 --> 01:05.108
This is the third time
this week it's gotten away.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.806
I made it! I made it!

01:07.850 --> 01:09.634
Oh, my side.

01:10.244 --> 01:12.028
Ouch!

01:12.072 --> 01:14.552
Let's get back to the Tower
and start tracking that ship.

01:16.772 --> 01:20.689
Odd. It seems to just disappear
once it gets over Jump City.

01:20.732 --> 01:23.344
Check it! Isn't she amazing?

01:23.387 --> 01:25.389
I thinks I'm in love.

01:25.433 --> 01:28.175
You are aware this "She"
you feel the affection for

01:28.218 --> 01:29.741
is merely a land vehicle?

01:29.785 --> 01:33.397
Um, this is no ordinary
land vehicle, Starfire.

01:33.441 --> 01:36.357
You's looking at
the Takayama 3000.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.228
The sweetest moped ever built!

01:38.272 --> 01:40.796
Mmm, Takayama!

01:40.839 --> 01:42.972
You know, if I had
one of these babies,

01:43.015 --> 01:44.278
I would be super-fast!

01:44.321 --> 01:46.628
Catching all kinds of
UFOs up in this piece.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.847
Beast Boy,
you don't need a moped.

01:48.891 --> 01:50.153
Yeah, dude, you can fly.

01:50.197 --> 01:51.763
Yeah, but my arms gets tired.

01:51.807 --> 01:53.896
Then turn yourself into
a cheetah and run.

01:53.939 --> 01:56.159
Yeah, but then my legs
be getting tired.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.334
Ah! Look!

01:57.378 --> 01:58.944
I needs me this moped.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.337
Think you can
build me one, brah?

02:00.381 --> 02:02.034
Sorry, BB, no can do.

02:02.078 --> 02:03.210
Got to fix up the sci-cow.

02:05.429 --> 02:08.171
Think I can borrow a few dollars so
I can buy this sweet moped, Mama?

02:08.215 --> 02:09.520
No.

02:09.564 --> 02:11.174
No.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.176
The no.

02:13.220 --> 02:16.484
Oh. How am I supposed to get a moped
if everyone keeps shutting me down?

02:16.527 --> 02:20.052
Well, you could always just
get a job and buy one.

02:20.096 --> 02:22.533
Oh... Oh, yeah!

02:22.577 --> 02:25.623
I'm gonna be getting me a job!

02:32.195 --> 02:33.240
Hey, there, Jimmy!

02:33.283 --> 02:35.198
I see you found our sign.

02:35.242 --> 02:38.288
You like meat? It's meatastic!

02:38.332 --> 02:40.203
Uh, it's Beast Boy.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.509
Actually, and... Um...

02:41.552 --> 02:43.424
I'm a vegetarian, so...

02:43.467 --> 02:45.252
I really couldn't work here.

02:45.295 --> 02:46.905
That's super, rookie!

02:46.949 --> 02:49.691
Say, do you like mopeds?

02:49.734 --> 02:52.694
Because we're giving away
a shiny Takayama 3000 moped

02:52.737 --> 02:54.783
to the employee person
of the month!

02:54.826 --> 02:56.959
When do I start?

02:57.002 --> 03:00.223
Welcome to the Mega
Meaty Meat family, Philip.

03:00.267 --> 03:01.790
I'll be in the back.

03:01.833 --> 03:04.619
Hey, wait! Aren't you supposed
to train me or something?

03:04.662 --> 03:07.622
Um, can I, uh, take your order?

03:07.665 --> 03:09.014
Give me the Number One.

03:09.058 --> 03:11.365
Right. Uh, Number One,
coming up!

03:12.757 --> 03:14.846
Uh, does this look like
a Number One?

03:14.890 --> 03:17.240
I don't care. I'm just hungry.

03:17.284 --> 03:18.546
What up, Beasty?

03:18.589 --> 03:20.243
Welcome to Mega Meaty Meats.

03:20.287 --> 03:23.594
If it ain't Mega, then it
ain't Meaty Meats that's Mega.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.117
How can I help you?

03:25.161 --> 03:26.336
Let's see. I'll have...

03:26.380 --> 03:28.208
Eight, Number Threes,
five Number Twos,

03:28.251 --> 03:29.296
two Number Ones, and...

03:29.339 --> 03:30.340
A diet soda.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.212
Actually, we don't have soda.

03:32.255 --> 03:34.257
- Only meat.
- Okay, then make it a cup of meat juice.

03:34.301 --> 03:37.913
Specifically, what variety of
the meat is it that you serve?

03:37.956 --> 03:40.611
Um, Meaty says
that's a trade secret.

03:40.655 --> 03:44.093
I'm glad you found a place to make
some extra money, Beast Boy, but,

03:44.136 --> 03:47.009
don't you think this
place seems a little weird?

03:47.052 --> 03:50.230
Dude, they have fries
made out of meat!

03:50.273 --> 03:51.318
This whole place is weird!

03:51.361 --> 03:53.015
And I hate it!

03:53.058 --> 03:56.105
But I'm not leaving
until I earn that moped.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.977
Trouble! The UFO is back.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.196
Titans, go!

04:01.328 --> 04:03.112
Beast Boy, you coming?

04:03.155 --> 04:04.331
Mmm, I can't.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.507
I'll get fired.
And if I gets fired

04:06.550 --> 04:08.465
then I won't gets
that sweet moped.

04:08.509 --> 04:10.467
Let's go, baby!
We'll handle it!

04:19.998 --> 04:22.523
Okay, Titans,
just like we planned.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.411
Okay, whatever you are...

04:41.455 --> 04:43.370
Come out with your hands
or tentacles up!

04:47.635 --> 04:50.290
So, we're being invaded by cows?

04:50.333 --> 04:51.726
Use caution, please.

04:51.769 --> 04:55.643
The cow people of Garlon Prime
are most formidable.

04:55.686 --> 04:58.559
No! This is just
a plain old Earth cow.

04:58.602 --> 04:59.603
And it's not the pilot.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.562
It's the power supply?

05:01.605 --> 05:03.215
Oh, that's less strange.

05:03.259 --> 05:06.480
But if the cow's not
controlling the ship, who is?

05:07.916 --> 05:10.179
I guess we're gonna
find out the hard way.

05:17.969 --> 05:20.145
Okay, uh, that's five
Number One's, a Number Two

05:20.189 --> 05:21.451
three meat pies,
a large meat-shake,

05:21.495 --> 05:23.323
and a jumbo meat fry, right?

05:23.366 --> 05:26.413
Uh, Meaty, any chance you
wanna help me out here, bro?

05:26.456 --> 05:28.328
You're doing great, Melly.

05:28.371 --> 05:29.546
I'll just be in the back here.

05:29.590 --> 05:31.113
Wait, no!

05:31.156 --> 05:34.421
Why didn't I just
go with the Titans?

05:34.464 --> 05:37.772
I want my Mega Meaty Meat!

05:37.815 --> 05:39.991
I'll be right back.

05:42.516 --> 05:43.517
Meaty?

05:46.781 --> 05:47.651
Huh?

05:55.355 --> 05:56.834
What is this place?

05:56.878 --> 05:59.881
It is the mother ship,
green human worker.

05:59.924 --> 06:02.449
So this is where all the
UFOs are coming from.

06:02.492 --> 06:06.148
Why are you here, and what
are you doing to all these cows?

06:06.191 --> 06:09.456
In exchange for providing us
power for our technology,

06:09.499 --> 06:11.849
we have replaced them
in your food chain

06:11.893 --> 06:14.765
with a nutritious
meat-free substitute.

06:14.809 --> 06:18.116
Wait. You mean Meaty Meat
is actually tofu?

06:18.160 --> 06:20.205
Not tofu. Nofu.

06:20.249 --> 06:22.817
Tofu comes from
your planet's soybeans.

06:22.860 --> 06:25.559
Nofu comes from me.

06:27.430 --> 06:29.954
Oh, gross, dude.

06:29.998 --> 06:31.173
Who are you?

06:45.230 --> 06:47.711
I am The Source!

06:49.452 --> 06:51.367
Tiny.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.892
You know, Francis, it's a
shame it has to end this way.

06:54.936 --> 06:57.547
Your magnificent cows are mine.

06:57.591 --> 07:01.246
My collector ships are dealing
with your friends as we speak.

07:01.290 --> 07:04.467
This ship is fueled,
and once we leave orbit...

07:04.511 --> 07:06.295
Kaboom! Shapow!

07:06.338 --> 07:07.209
Swagabaggabang!

07:21.702 --> 07:23.530
You won't get away with this!

07:26.663 --> 07:28.535
What are you doing?

07:28.578 --> 07:30.798
You's coming with me, son!

07:33.975 --> 07:37.413
Ludicrous human!
There is no escape.

07:39.241 --> 07:40.329
Huh?

07:40.372 --> 07:42.331
Ooh, Takayama.

07:44.638 --> 07:46.161
Yeah, boy!

07:48.293 --> 07:49.860
This is so cool!

07:51.732 --> 07:53.298
Help!

07:54.561 --> 07:55.649
Help! The help!

07:55.692 --> 07:56.780
UFOs with tentacles!

07:56.824 --> 07:58.739
Those are always the worst!

08:01.568 --> 08:02.699
Insolent human!

08:02.743 --> 08:05.267
Your futile charge
will end in defeat.

08:05.310 --> 08:10.272
Oh, yeah? You forget
we're riding a Takayama 3000!

08:11.491 --> 08:14.102
And it has turbo!

08:22.284 --> 08:23.328
Yes!

08:51.487 --> 08:52.662
Time to save Earth!

09:21.125 --> 09:22.997
Beast Boy, you just
saved the whole world

09:23.040 --> 09:25.739
from cow-kidnapping UFOs?

09:25.782 --> 09:27.697
Yeah, I'm not really sure
what just happened.

09:27.741 --> 09:30.526
Yes, today was the very weird

09:30.570 --> 09:33.050
and confusing and mystifying,

09:33.094 --> 09:34.748
and somewhat uncomfortable,

09:34.791 --> 09:37.707
and yet, strangely familiar.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.404
Dude, you're telling me.

09:39.448 --> 09:43.060
So, it turns out that Meaty
Meat is really space tofu

09:43.104 --> 09:46.237
that came here to steal cows
and destroy Earth!

09:46.281 --> 09:48.631
But I punched Meaty
in his meaty face,

09:48.675 --> 09:52.026
kidnapped the alien leader,
and destroyed the mother ship.

09:52.069 --> 09:55.812
And I did it all thanks to my
awesome new moped!

09:55.856 --> 09:58.467
So, what happened
to the alien leader?

09:58.510 --> 10:00.034
Oh, he's right over there.

10:06.736 --> 10:10.000
What?
