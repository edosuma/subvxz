WEBVTT

00:00.083 --> 00:02.169
- Why didn't you say you love me back?

00:02.252 --> 00:05.255
- Uh... I don't know.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.466
We're j-- we're just kind of
getting to know each other,

00:07.549 --> 00:08.675
and...

00:17.017 --> 00:19.686
- Any last words
before I blow your brains out?

00:21.021 --> 00:23.190
- Don't shoot me, okay?

00:23.273 --> 00:24.525
You ain't got to do this.

00:25.984 --> 00:28.946
You ain't got to do this, man.

00:32.699 --> 00:34.034
Yeah.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.744
Just let me...

00:37.538 --> 00:38.789
- Why are you doing that?

00:40.165 --> 00:42.084
Cut it out!

00:42.167 --> 00:43.460
Stop it!

00:43.544 --> 00:44.628
You look at me when I kill you.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.630
Look at me!

00:46.713 --> 00:48.632
I know that there's nothing up there.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.834
- Ah! Shit.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.502
Ah!

01:26.503 --> 01:28.589
Ah... Ah!

01:28.672 --> 01:30.007
- Go home.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.800
I'm sure there's
a real hero somewhere

01:31.884 --> 01:33.135
in need of a goofy sidekick.

01:34.469 --> 01:35.971
Well, you're not alone...

01:36.054 --> 01:37.806
anymore.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.813
I've got you, I promise.

01:44.897 --> 01:47.191
Kevin!

01:47.274 --> 01:48.692
Focus.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.041
- I owe you one.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.677
It's a simple jump.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.432
Three, two, one.

02:26.563 --> 02:27.564
Yes.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.359
Hey.

02:30.442 --> 02:33.320
Hey, come on. Jordan, no.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.615
Come on, get up, get up. Jordan, no.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.242
Look at me, look at me.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.869
No. Don't you die, don't you die.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.371
I'm not gonna let you die.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.415
Come on, Jordan, you c...

02:45.499 --> 02:47.543
you can't, you can't die, not...

02:47.626 --> 02:49.878
Come on, Jordan, get up.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.713
Don't d...

02:51.797 --> 02:54.132
Jordan! Jordan!

02:54.216 --> 02:57.135
I jumped. I got over here.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.428
Jordan?

02:58.512 --> 03:01.014
I fucking jumped.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.601
I fucking jumped.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.064
I fucking...

03:09.147 --> 03:11.149
Breathe.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.488
Bravo. It's a wrap, everybody.

03:16.572 --> 03:19.283
Bravo.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.370
- The fuck...?

03:24.913 --> 03:26.039
A wrap?

03:26.123 --> 03:27.749
- Agent Hart!

03:27.833 --> 03:28.876
- Coach Ron?

03:28.959 --> 03:30.544
- Yeah!

03:32.212 --> 03:34.047
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.841
- The fuck is happening?

03:37.384 --> 03:39.761
- Hey, man, it was good working with you.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.805
No hard feelings, man. Sorry.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.897
- Hi.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.024
- Oh, no. Come on, Jordan.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.026
This was a part of it, too?

03:54.109 --> 03:55.652
- Yeah. Sorry, Kevin.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.279
- Jordan.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.573
But I really thought that I lost you.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.284
- Oh, Kevin.
- No...

04:02.367 --> 04:04.661
- Well, I guess I'm glad
that you're alive.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.915
- Well, movie magic.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.792
- Very good.
- Movie magic.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.044
- Very good.

04:15.339 --> 04:16.673
- Jordan, no.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.842
Come on, get up, get up.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.928
Jordan, you can't do this. Don't die.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.763
Come on, Jordan, get up.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.766
Don't d... Jordan!

04:25.849 --> 04:27.976
Jordan!

04:28.060 --> 04:31.563
I did it, I jumped. I got over here.

04:31.647 --> 04:34.775
Jordan? I fucking jumped.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.488
I fucking jumped.

04:55.254 --> 04:58.006
- Well?

05:02.970 --> 05:06.473
- That may be the strangest movie
I've ever seen.

05:09.142 --> 05:14.022
So bizarre and-and... violent.

05:16.942 --> 05:20.487
And yet...

05:20.571 --> 05:23.073
authentic.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.785
You can't teach acting like that.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.161
- So you liked it?
- Like it?

05:28.245 --> 05:29.788
I like kidney-shaped swimming pools.

05:29.872 --> 05:32.207
I like reduced-fat eggnog.

05:32.291 --> 05:35.586
This movie, I loved.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.130
- He loves it.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.715
- How does it feel to be a leading man

05:39.798 --> 05:41.258
in your own action movie?

05:41.341 --> 05:43.385
- Wow.
- Kevin.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.263
Please.
- Oh, the center stage.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.723
Uh...

05:47.806 --> 05:50.517
No, stop, stop. Guys.

05:50.601 --> 05:53.395
Well, I learned two things.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.397
The first thing is that it's dangerous.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.400
It's dangerous as hell.
I mean, I was set on fire,

05:58.483 --> 06:00.027
I was hit in the head with a bat...

06:00.110 --> 06:01.361
punched, kicked.

06:01.445 --> 06:03.322
I'm really gonna be scarred.
- That was f...

06:03.405 --> 06:04.698
- No, I'm serious-- I don't know

06:04.781 --> 06:06.700
why you're laughing.
I'm being very serious.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.994
I'm gonna have real issues
because of this guy right here.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.787
- Fuck yeah!
- It's-- no...

06:10.871 --> 06:14.041
It's not a "fuck yeah."
It's-it's a serious thing.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.129
The second thing
that I learned is that, uh...

06:21.131 --> 06:23.759
...there's no such thing as a leading man.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.679
Because you're nothing
without your costars.

06:31.016 --> 06:34.478
And I had that in-in you guys,
so thank you-- Come on.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.313
Get up here. Seriously.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.523
Get up here.
- Buddy.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.358
- Take this in. Take it in with me.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.777
Wait, wait. Do I get top billing?

06:41.860 --> 06:43.153
- Yeah. You have top billing.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.239
- Nice. I didn't-- I forgot to ask.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.282
- Well, I think it's time to celebrate.
- Yes!

06:47.366 --> 06:48.825
- Looks like we've got a hit on our hands.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.119
- Claude. Congratulations.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.205
Hey. Congratulations, everybody.

06:53.288 --> 06:56.667
- Ladies and gentlemen,

06:56.750 --> 06:58.252
we have a real treat for you today.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.045
- Okay-- wait, wait, wait, wait,
easy with the spoilers.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.713
This requires a little dramatic buildup.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.340
- Okay. Here it is.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.175
Now you know that I'm not a big fan

07:05.259 --> 07:07.761
of these high-budget action films.

07:07.845 --> 07:11.014
- Here she goes again,
with her love of fancy foreign films.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.016
- I have discerning taste.
This is my buildup.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.977
This is what you requested.
- Continue.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.187
- This movie
by Claude Van De Velde moved me.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.439
I got to say.
- It's an incredible film.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.316
- And...
- I've seen it 27 times.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.776
Team Van De Velde right here.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.486
- The hero of this movie

07:24.570 --> 07:26.488
is not the action star
that you would expect.

07:26.572 --> 07:29.741
The one that really saves the day.

07:29.825 --> 07:31.451
Well, we have him here today.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.579
Ladies and gentlemen...

07:33.662 --> 07:35.789
Sassy the Squirrel.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.207
- Aw, Sassy...

07:37.291 --> 07:38.917
- Oh, you're a lot bigger in person.

07:39.001 --> 07:40.961
- Oh, hell no.
