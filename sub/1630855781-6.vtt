- Can you feel that? Keep pulling.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.000

00:42.320 --> 00:44.160

Oh!

- Whoo!

00:48.239 --> 00:50.239
Oh! Wha...

00:50.239 --> 00:53.040
- Hello, beautiful.
- I don't think that's a river fish.

00:53.040 --> 00:56.040
I think you should
probably throw that back, no?

00:56.040 --> 00:57.040
Ah-ah!

00:57.599 --> 01:00.440
- Don't touch my fish.
- It needs to go back.

01:00.440 --> 01:01.839
I said don't.

01:09.119 --> 01:10.040
Oh my...

01:10.560 --> 01:11.399
God?

01:13.040 --> 01:16.560
Please don't tell me
you were expecting an old white guy.

01:16.560 --> 01:17.560
Hmm?

01:18.080 --> 01:19.880
Now, we need to have a little talk.

01:21.399 --> 01:22.399
Am I in trouble?

01:22.399 --> 01:25.119
Why are you turning your back
on your church?

01:25.119 --> 01:27.600
Look, I... I don't want to, but I...

01:28.200 --> 01:30.479
I don't think I can be baptized.

01:30.479 --> 01:32.479
- It's too hard.
- Life is hard!

01:32.479 --> 01:34.800
And sacrifices must be made.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.240
But your church needs you.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.280
I need you.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.199
I sin all the time.

01:40.199 --> 01:41.560
I had a wank this morning.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.960
And you know I wear my pants
two days in a row.

01:43.960 --> 01:45.280
And I--

01:46.839 --> 01:49.800
Eric Effiong! You are my precious child.

01:49.800 --> 01:53.679
You are brave and bold
and absolutely "effervocious."

01:54.880 --> 01:58.280
- I don't think that's a word.
- Are you arguing with God?

01:58.280 --> 02:01.160
No, I... I just...
Maybe you're trying to say effervescent?

02:01.160 --> 02:03.399
- Which is very kind of you--
- Sh, sh, sh.

02:04.199 --> 02:06.479
Stop and listen.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.400
- Cal?

Good mornin', sunshine.

03:38.959 --> 03:41.560
- Uh... Uh, no. No, excuse me.
- Oh!

03:41.560 --> 03:43.920
What... what are you doing in my house?

03:43.920 --> 03:47.320
I, uh... popped by to see your mum.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.679
- Okay.
- I've got a free period, so...

03:50.239 --> 03:54.239
Oh, um... you've... you've just got
a few crumbs in your neck brace.

03:54.239 --> 03:56.440
- What happened, by the way?
- None of your business.

03:56.440 --> 03:59.600
Look, Otis,
you don't have to be like that.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.760
I know that things got a little bit tense
at the debate,

04:02.760 --> 04:04.679
but it's a competition.

04:04.679 --> 04:08.359
Tense? You lied about me
in front of the entire college.

04:08.359 --> 04:11.519
I didn't lie. And you outed me
in front of the entire college.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.920
Dr. Milburn!

04:14.440 --> 04:17.039
Hi. Um,
I hope you don't mind me poppin' by.

04:17.039 --> 04:20.120
I just wanted to run through a few things
before our show tonight.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.240
Yeah, sure.

04:21.240 --> 04:24.120
- Do you wanna pop into my office?
- I'll leave you guys to it.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.560
I'll be there in just a minute. Otis!

04:28.400 --> 04:29.240
Darling.

04:29.800 --> 04:33.880
- I didn't know she was coming.
- Whatever. Mum, I've gotta go.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.479
Wait, wait.

04:35.479 --> 04:40.160
Look, I know Maeve is going through
a vulnerable time right now.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.640
I just... I think that maybe
you should pay attention

04:43.640 --> 04:45.240
to your own instincts on things.

04:45.240 --> 04:50.120
Mum, it was both of us the other night.
Okay? Maeve didn't make me do anything.

04:50.120 --> 04:53.680
Okay. Just it's my job to worry about you.

04:53.680 --> 04:56.160
You weren't worried about me
when you hired my nemesis

04:56.160 --> 04:57.599
to be your cohost, were you?

04:58.360 --> 04:59.800
Enjoy your prep meeting.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.479
Oh, hi. Please, take a wee seat.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.080
This is a safe space.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.479
Wow.

05:31.640 --> 05:32.599
O?

05:33.520 --> 05:35.120
Hi, hi. Hello.

05:35.720 --> 05:36.760
Hi.

05:37.359 --> 05:39.320
Ruby! Hey.

05:40.039 --> 05:41.479
Ooh.

05:41.479 --> 05:43.599
What are you doing here? What is that?

05:44.200 --> 05:47.320
Oh, uh... it's nothing. Um... A crick.

05:47.320 --> 05:50.720
I wanted to speak with you about

05:50.720 --> 05:53.080
the whole next steps
for the election thing.

05:53.080 --> 05:56.080
Otis, people think you're a meninist
who outs people.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.000
No, I know, but I'm not.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.599
And, well, you're so good at PR.

06:00.599 --> 06:05.280
I think you can get the truth out there
and counteract this whole spin from O.

06:09.840 --> 06:12.320
Yes, okay. I'll get onto that today.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.280
- Thanks.
- Where are you going?

06:14.280 --> 06:18.720
Ah, well, it's Maeve's mum's... funeral.

06:18.720 --> 06:19.880
- Oh.
- Yeah.

06:20.560 --> 06:23.799
Which, uh... reminds me, actually. Um...

06:24.560 --> 06:27.919
I wanna say, like, if... if you bump
into Maeve for whatever reason,

06:27.919 --> 06:31.880
and she asks you about that night,
you know, when I stayed over,

06:33.359 --> 06:35.320
I told her we were
working on the campaign,

06:35.320 --> 06:37.680
and we accidentally fell asleep.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.440
That is what happened.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.680
No, I know.
But, like, you know, that wasn't great.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.760
And I just don't want her to think
that we're more than friends.

06:46.760 --> 06:49.840
That's why you came here.
To do damage control on your relationship?

06:49.840 --> 06:50.880
No.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.479
I mean, a little bit, but no.

06:53.479 --> 06:56.400
I wanted to speak with you
about the campaign.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.039
Maeve doesn't need to worry.
We're not more than friends.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.560
- We're not friends at all.
- Ruby.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.039
- It isn't very you.
- Hmm.

07:13.680 --> 07:17.440
Yeah, but it is a proper funeral dress,
which means Mum would have loved it.

07:18.000 --> 07:18.880
Okay.

07:21.640 --> 07:22.520
God.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.560
- Does my eye look really bad?
- No.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.320
What happened?

07:28.919 --> 07:31.880
Otis and I tried to have sex.
It was a disaster.

07:31.880 --> 07:32.960
Ooh.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.719
Yeah, we're not really speaking.

07:34.719 --> 07:37.960
It's a bit of a long story.
I was gonna text you about it, but...

07:39.280 --> 07:40.760
Yeah.

07:41.640 --> 07:44.880
Well, I know we're not
in a very good place right now. I get it.

07:49.400 --> 07:52.080
Aimes, I think the Isaac thing
makes me uncomfortable.

07:53.840 --> 07:57.599
- D-do you reckon you two could be friends?
- Yes. Absolutely.

07:58.239 --> 08:00.880
I should never have brought it up,
seriously. I mean...

08:01.520 --> 08:05.000
Nothin' happened,
and nothin' ever will happen. I promise.

08:13.400 --> 08:16.640
And I cannot believe you're going
to a funeral with a sex injury.

08:18.960 --> 08:19.840
She'd be proud.

08:19.840 --> 08:21.120
Stop. Stop.

08:21.120 --> 08:23.799
Maeve, there's someone
from Wallace on the phone.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.359
Uh... What did they say?

08:26.359 --> 08:29.880
They're asking if you're going back
to finish the course.

08:30.799 --> 08:33.120
Well, tell them I'm busy.
I'll call them back.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.720
Cremating my mother today.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.360
- Hello?
- <i>Jackson Marchetti?</i>

08:45.360 --> 08:47.760
- Yeah.
<i>- Your test results have come in.</i>

08:47.760 --> 08:50.400
<i>The doctor would like to see you
at four p.m. today.</i>

08:50.400 --> 08:52.520
Uh, okay, I'll... I'll see you then.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.280
<i>See you later on.</i>

09:15.920 --> 09:16.839
What the fuck?

09:30.199 --> 09:35.120
As you know, I am passionate about
debunking sex myths on my video channel.

09:35.120 --> 09:39.320
So I was wonderin', is there a sex myth
that you would like to debunk?

09:41.440 --> 09:44.680
Uh... let's see. Off the top of my head...

09:44.680 --> 09:46.120
Um...

09:47.800 --> 09:54.120
I guess there's an enduring myth about
women who engage in a lot of sex

09:54.120 --> 09:55.920
having loose vulvas.

09:55.920 --> 09:59.360
Right, um... Okay, so... Ahem.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.000
Maybe we try it again,
just a little pithier.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.160
So I ask about the sex myth,

10:04.160 --> 10:06.680
and then you come straight in
with saggy vaginas.

10:07.520 --> 10:11.400
So, has Celia asked you
to help me with my delivery?

10:11.400 --> 10:12.839
No, no, no. Um...

10:12.839 --> 10:16.000
I think she just wants the show
to have a bit more of a pace.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.120
Right.

10:17.760 --> 10:18.600
God.

10:20.079 --> 10:24.079
This is so humiliating.
I'm being trained by a 17-year-old.

10:24.079 --> 10:26.880
Shit. Sorry, I... I don't mean
to tread on your toes.

10:26.880 --> 10:30.160
No. That's all right. It's not your fault.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.199
Well...

10:32.959 --> 10:35.680
I mean,
being live on air is very different

10:35.680 --> 10:39.240
than sitting face-to-face
to someone in private.

10:40.360 --> 10:42.320
So, maybe you're feelin'
a wee bit exposed?

10:42.320 --> 10:43.640
Yeah.

10:44.320 --> 10:47.680
In truth, I, um...
came back to work too soon.

10:47.680 --> 10:52.040
- And... Well, anyway, it doesn't matter.
- No, no, no. It... it does. It does matter.

10:54.560 --> 10:57.400
If you would like to share,
I'd like to listen.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.800
You know, there's still a feeling that

11:02.800 --> 11:05.719
if a woman gets off
the career roller coaster,

11:05.719 --> 11:07.719
that she won't be let back on again.

11:08.680 --> 11:12.680
And it took me quite a while
to get on in the first place, so...

11:12.680 --> 11:16.440
Really? I kind of just assumed
that you'd been doing this forever.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.079
Well, sure. Um...

11:18.959 --> 11:22.959
When I was still married,
my career was on track, and...

11:24.280 --> 11:26.680
And then, when my husband left, it...

11:27.920 --> 11:30.199
all just got very difficult.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.600
<i>There was the grief.</i>

11:32.600 --> 11:38.160
<i>And getting used to being
a single parent was... really hard.</i>

11:38.160 --> 11:39.440
Mum?

11:39.440 --> 11:42.120
Anyway, I eventually got stronger.

11:43.959 --> 11:48.839
And I knew that the most important thing
was that I was there for Otis.

11:48.839 --> 11:52.800
And so I decided that, well,
running my clinic would be enough.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.560
But I've always wanted more.

11:55.560 --> 11:58.760
And so when this... radio job came up,

11:58.760 --> 12:01.560
I didn't... I didn't want it to pass me by.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.440
Yeah. That all makes perfect sense.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.560
But it also sounds quite overwhelming.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.560
Gosh. How did you get me
to talk about all of that?

12:18.719 --> 12:22.719
I think that tonight is gonna go great.
I think you just need to trust yourself.

12:36.040 --> 12:40.199
Hi, team. I'm Samantha, your celebrant.

12:40.199 --> 12:41.199
- Wow.
- Ooh.

12:41.199 --> 12:43.000
- Hostess with the mostest.
- Hi.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.560
I will be guiding you
through your goodbyes.

12:46.079 --> 12:47.560
Ooh. What's happened to your eye?

12:47.560 --> 12:49.480
- She had a se--
- Oh, little accident.

12:49.480 --> 12:50.560
Mmm.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.880
Oh. What a lovely picture of Elaine.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.880
Er... Erin.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.040
My mum was called Erin.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.120
Yeah. Apologies.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.760
Okay, quick checklist.

13:02.760 --> 13:04.199
Photo, tick.

13:05.440 --> 13:09.079
- Do you have your own floral tributes?
- Yes, my brother's sorting that out.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.040
Tick.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.880
- Order of service?
- Oh, that was my job.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.240
Tick.

13:17.920 --> 13:18.760
Hmm.

13:19.520 --> 13:22.760
Do you have a track you'd like playing
for Erin's entrance?

13:23.360 --> 13:24.680
Yeah. I do.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.959
Tick.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.320
Oof, I like saying tick.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.199
Tick.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.520
What a great word.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.599
Trippingly on the tongue.
Tickety tick. Tick.

13:36.599 --> 13:37.920
Ai... Aimes.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.160
Sorry.

13:39.959 --> 13:41.240
Shall I proceed?

13:41.839 --> 13:43.280
Yeah.

13:49.199 --> 13:50.440
Oh.

13:50.440 --> 13:51.520
Nice suit.

13:52.800 --> 13:53.680
Thanks.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.199
- Thanks for lettin' me leave early.
- It's fine.

13:58.440 --> 14:02.680
Hey, you're doing really well in classes.
The kids are really listening to you.

14:03.280 --> 14:06.440
Maybe you could, uh...
teach a class on your own?

14:07.880 --> 14:10.079
Okay, yeah. Sure.

14:10.079 --> 14:13.480
Oh, um... can I just... Your tie's all...

14:13.480 --> 14:15.719
- Oh.
- Sorry. Mm...

14:18.160 --> 14:23.000
I mean, I... I couldn't do it.
My hands... shake when I'm nervous.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.360
Well, why are you nervous?

14:25.120 --> 14:27.199
Uh... might... might see my ex today.

14:28.319 --> 14:30.199
She your... your first love?

14:31.640 --> 14:33.120
Sh... Yeah.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.199
- Somethin'... somethin' like that.
- Oh.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.959
It's been a while, but it still hurts.

14:39.959 --> 14:44.800
Well, I don't think it ever gets easier,
but you look great, so...

14:44.800 --> 14:46.400
She's missing out.

14:51.360 --> 14:55.040
- Oh, my... me dad's here. Better go.
- Oh, all right. Cool. See you.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.760
- Adam. Adam!
- Yeah?

14:59.760 --> 15:00.800
You can drive.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Okay.

15:10.640 --> 15:14.599
Um... we don't normally allow food
during the service.

15:15.199 --> 15:16.079
Oh.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.719
I mean, they look delicious.

15:20.839 --> 15:22.319
- May I?
- Mmm!

15:26.680 --> 15:27.520
So good.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.439
Mm!

15:29.439 --> 15:31.839
Mmm! Oh, that's so good.

15:31.839 --> 15:33.280
Fuck's sake.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.800
- Sean's not picking up.
- I can go get some flowers.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.959
No. I don't really care about the flowers.

15:37.959 --> 15:39.560
- Oh.
- Honestly no need for all this.

15:39.560 --> 15:41.520
No one's coming. I told you.

15:47.760 --> 15:50.280
- How's the neck?
- Better, I think.

15:50.800 --> 15:54.079
- And how's the old penis?
- I don't know what's wrong with it.

15:54.079 --> 15:57.160
I was... I was feeling guilty
about staying at Ruby's house,

15:57.160 --> 15:59.959
and couldn't stop thinkin' about it.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.839
Do you think you were
trying to make Maeve a little jealous?

16:03.400 --> 16:06.040
- No.
- No? Not even a little bit?

16:07.079 --> 16:10.120
I wouldn't have had to stay there if
you didn't dump me for your new friends.

16:10.120 --> 16:13.000
Ah! Wh... Hang on. Are you blaming me?

16:13.000 --> 16:15.439
Otis, you literally said
you were fine with it!

16:15.959 --> 16:17.479
It's Maeve. Wait.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.479
Hey.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.000
Sean was to be here at 12:00.
He's not picking up his phone.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.319
- I'm sure he'll be there soon.
- What is it?

16:26.319 --> 16:28.000
I really need him to be here, Otis.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.040
Uh... we'll find him. Don't worry.
Uh, where's he staying?

16:32.040 --> 16:33.079
<i>His mate's.</i>

16:33.079 --> 16:34.359
Dodgy Mo.

16:35.199 --> 16:36.479
Text me the address?

16:36.479 --> 16:37.760
<i>I'll send it now.</i>

16:37.760 --> 16:39.760
Okay, yeah. Don't worry.

16:39.760 --> 16:40.680
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Bye-bye.

16:40.680 --> 16:41.800
<i>Bye.</i>

16:42.839 --> 16:44.920
Where are <i>we</i> going?

16:44.920 --> 16:48.079
To find someone called Dodgy Mo.

16:52.920 --> 16:54.880
Oh my God, Turtle!

16:54.880 --> 16:58.880
She just smiled.
Not a gassy one. Like, an actual smile.

17:00.680 --> 17:03.839
- Has she ever done that before?
- No. Hello.

17:03.839 --> 17:07.240
Go on, smile for Mummy. Smile for Mummy.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.440
Oh fuck. Sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.800
- It's okay.
- Come on, darling. Smile for Mummy.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.760
- I think she's hungry.
- Oh, okay.

17:13.760 --> 17:17.359
It's okay. I just, um...
I've got such a bad headache.

17:17.359 --> 17:20.640
They said this would happen
when I started taking the antidepressants.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.280
Do you have any pain meds, Jo?

17:22.280 --> 17:23.640
No, I don't.

17:24.480 --> 17:25.399
Sorry.

17:26.040 --> 17:30.399
Yes. I've been thinking about
this childcare.

17:30.399 --> 17:34.399
I mean, maybe I could open a nursery.

17:34.399 --> 17:37.880
You know, like... like
one of those fancy ones with baby yoga.

17:37.880 --> 17:38.840
Yeah.

17:38.840 --> 17:42.320
Would you do that
before or after you cleared your debt?

17:43.280 --> 17:47.159
Yeah, I, um... I wanted to, uh,
talk to you about that, actually, um...

17:47.159 --> 17:51.320
About you maybe loaning me the money.
I mean, I... I would pay it all back.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.320
- Obviously.
- Um...

17:53.840 --> 17:54.960
That's a lot of money.

17:54.960 --> 17:57.440
But can we talk about this another time?

17:57.440 --> 18:01.280
I mean, I promise I'll think about it.
I just... I have to go to the pharmacy.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.280
Shit. Can you...
can you grab me a Mooncup?

18:03.919 --> 18:07.760
And also, some of those fiber powder
things. I haven't pooed for days.

18:08.280 --> 18:12.120
- Actually, I'll just come with you.
- Great. Okay...

18:23.320 --> 18:25.120
Why are you being so quiet?

18:25.120 --> 18:28.240
It's hypocritical of you
to take the queer night so personally.

18:28.240 --> 18:31.040
- You dump me for Maeve all the time.
- Look, Eric!

18:31.040 --> 18:33.520
- Her mum--
- It's not the first time, is it?

18:36.360 --> 18:38.760
No. I hardly ever see you anymore, Eric.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.159
You're always with Abbi and those guys.

18:41.159 --> 18:42.320
Oh!

18:46.440 --> 18:47.320
Hello.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.840
Oh, uh... hi. Hi!
Uh, we are looking for Dodgy Mo.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.320
- Not his actual name.
- It's his street name.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.800
Dodgy Mo. Yeah, yeah, that's me.

19:02.399 --> 19:04.280
Is Sean staying here?

19:04.280 --> 19:06.640
No. Sean didn't come back last night.

19:08.200 --> 19:11.640
Well, if you see him, could you ask him
to call his sister Maeve?

19:11.640 --> 19:13.480
- It's urgent.
- Yes.

19:15.360 --> 19:16.399
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

19:16.960 --> 19:19.280
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Dodgy Mo.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.480
Hang on a sec.

19:21.480 --> 19:22.919
Uh... Yeah...

19:26.760 --> 19:28.600
These got delivered for Sean.

19:28.600 --> 19:29.800
- Uh...
- Sorry.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.080
I can't have them in the house
'cause of me allergies, so...

19:32.080 --> 19:33.240
- Oh.
- If you take 'em?

19:33.240 --> 19:35.080
You'll probably see him before me, so...

19:35.080 --> 19:36.800
- Of course. Mm-hmm.
- Of course.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.560
- Thanks.
- Mmm. Uh... Yeah.

19:41.640 --> 19:42.720
Um...

19:47.760 --> 19:49.399
So, I don't get it.

19:49.399 --> 19:51.520
- You don't want me to have other friends?
- No!

19:51.520 --> 19:52.640
- Or what?
- I dunno.

19:52.640 --> 19:56.280
I just sometimes feel like
you'd rather hang out with the cool kids.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.480
I'm getting left behind.

19:57.480 --> 20:00.760
I wouldn't rather hang out
with those other guys, Oatcake.

20:00.760 --> 20:04.240
But sometimes we have more in common.

20:04.240 --> 20:06.919
Can you tell me one thing
that's been goin' on in my life?

20:06.919 --> 20:09.240
Uh... You going back to church?

20:09.240 --> 20:11.840
No, I'm not, actually!

20:11.840 --> 20:15.080
I'm having an existential crisis about it,
but you wouldn't know that.

20:15.080 --> 20:18.480
- You don't care if it's not about you.
- What?

20:18.480 --> 20:21.560
That's... Uh... No! That's... that is so unfair.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.919
How is it unfair?

20:22.919 --> 20:23.880
- Go on.
- Uh...

20:23.880 --> 20:25.399
- Whoa. Wow. Wow!
- Whoa!

20:25.399 --> 20:27.080
- Oh my gosh!
- Whoa!

20:27.080 --> 20:29.560
I can't stop. I can't stop! Eric, help!

20:29.560 --> 20:31.800
Oatcake! Oh my gosh!

20:31.800 --> 20:34.040
- Ah!
- Ow!

20:34.040 --> 20:37.040
- Ow! Oh... Ow!
- Oatcake!

20:37.040 --> 20:39.000
- Oh my gosh. Are you okay?
- Aah! I'll just--

20:39.000 --> 20:40.760
- Give me your hand.
- There's pine in my eye.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.200
- Give me your hand!
- Oh, yeah...

20:42.200 --> 20:43.919
Here!

20:43.919 --> 20:45.880
- Oh my gosh.
- Ow! There's something in my eye.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.520
- Are you okay? Let me see your eye. Let--
- I'm fine.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.720
Fucking neck brace!

20:57.240 --> 20:58.480
The flowers! Oh!

20:58.480 --> 21:00.600
- They're gonna be okay.
- What are we gonna do?

21:00.600 --> 21:03.320
- It's going to be okay. Yes.
- Eric, put them back in the holes.

21:03.320 --> 21:04.760
No. No, Oatcake.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.520
Carnations on the outside.
Roses on the inside.

21:07.520 --> 21:09.040
Follow the color code.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.399
We have stuff in common as well, right?

21:16.679 --> 21:18.120
Of course we do.

21:18.720 --> 21:21.880
I'm just trying to say that there's...
there's parts of my life

21:21.880 --> 21:24.919
- that you don't really understand.
- Like what?

21:24.919 --> 21:28.159
Well, like the fact that I'm a Christian.

21:28.159 --> 21:31.560
Or the fact that my family doesn't have
as much money as yours.

21:31.560 --> 21:34.600
Or we don't talk about race, for example.

21:35.600 --> 21:40.040
Look, I'm just... I guess I'm just trying
to say that we're very different,

21:40.040 --> 21:41.520
and we don't talk about it.

21:41.520 --> 21:45.159
- Okay. Why are you blaming me for that?
- I'm not blaming you.

21:45.159 --> 21:47.720
I'm just trying to say how I feel.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.480
Okay. Well, um... we're gonna be late.

21:56.480 --> 22:00.120
We should just get this sorted and...

22:04.000 --> 22:04.919
Great.

22:08.800 --> 22:09.800
Constable.

22:09.800 --> 22:12.760
Famous for his landscapes,
mainly of the Suffolk countryside,

22:12.760 --> 22:14.399
which sounds boring, but in his hands,

22:14.399 --> 22:17.280
these luscious landscapes
pulsate with drama.

22:17.800 --> 22:21.360
Festering riverbanks,
crumbling brickwork, slimy bridges,

22:21.360 --> 22:23.720
living, breathing, moving trees.

22:25.280 --> 22:26.439
He loved willows.

22:26.439 --> 22:28.439
He was drawn to their sloping frames,

22:28.439 --> 22:31.159
their branches plunging
deep into undulating water.

22:31.159 --> 22:33.679
- You feel the moist air of the mornings.
- Yeah.

22:33.679 --> 22:36.120
He painted another form for feeling.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.040
Yes?

22:37.040 --> 22:38.480
May I use the bathroom?

22:38.480 --> 22:41.120
Yes. Sorry. Of course you can.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.320
Where was I? Oh, yes.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.360
Constable's unrecognized genius.

22:45.360 --> 22:48.600
This visceral living, moving...

23:00.919 --> 23:02.120
Can I touch you?

23:26.679 --> 23:27.919
Ooh...

23:38.360 --> 23:42.200
I'm sorry. I'm on T,
so I thought I wouldn't get my period.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.280
Don't worry. I don't mind.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.040
Are you all right?

23:50.880 --> 23:51.760
Yeah.

23:52.320 --> 23:53.280
Um...

23:54.000 --> 23:56.439
I think I just, uh...
I think I need a second.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.560
Pick up. Pick up the phone, you dick.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.880
Fuck's sake.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.520
- Oh my God.
- Hey.

24:26.520 --> 24:27.560
Hi.

24:30.040 --> 24:31.919
- Oh--
- We couldn't find him.

24:31.919 --> 24:35.520
The flowers, they sort of broke
in the middle a little bit. Sorry.

24:43.760 --> 24:44.960
Are you okay?

24:47.080 --> 24:49.679
Yeah. Just wish
Sean would pick up the fucking phone.

24:53.240 --> 24:55.080
It's almost time to start.

24:56.520 --> 24:59.600
Are you waiting on... some people?

24:59.600 --> 25:01.520
Uh, no, this is... this is everyone.

25:02.360 --> 25:04.960
Shall we just get it over with?

25:04.960 --> 25:06.919
- Yeah.
- Well, actually...

25:08.480 --> 25:10.760
Wait. Wait, wait. A flower.

25:15.080 --> 25:16.960
What... what are they doing here?

25:16.960 --> 25:19.560
You worried about
your mum being alone, so I invited them.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.280
I hope I didn't do the wrong thing.

25:22.960 --> 25:25.640
It's a really nice thing to do.
Thanks, Aimes.

25:26.159 --> 25:29.720
Oh, good. I wondered
who was gonna carry the coffin.

25:30.520 --> 25:31.520
Come on.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.760
Oh, yeah.

25:35.080 --> 25:36.040
Come on.

25:36.040 --> 25:37.720
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.

25:58.560 --> 25:59.399
Hi.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.560
It was my mum's favorite.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.480
I love this song.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.679
Okay, uh... to me.

26:26.679 --> 26:28.560
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.
- Pivot. Pivot.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.080
Okay. Okay.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.720
Please be upstanding, for those who can.

26:36.320 --> 26:37.679
That means you.

26:40.520 --> 26:44.840
<i>♪ See the stone set in your eyes ♪</i>

26:44.840 --> 26:48.000
<i>♪ See the thorn twist in your side... ♪</i>

26:48.000 --> 26:51.159
<i>♪ I... for... ♪</i>

26:51.159 --> 26:52.640
Oh.

26:54.439 --> 26:57.040
Sorry, the... the Wi-Fi is...

26:57.040 --> 26:58.520
Shall... shall we go back?

26:59.520 --> 27:01.560
- Shall we... shall we start again?
- No, keep going.

27:02.159 --> 27:03.600
- Uh, back it up a bit?
- Adam.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.399
- Otis, keep going.
- Adam, wh...

27:05.399 --> 27:06.960
- Ah!
- Sorry.

27:06.960 --> 27:07.919
- Sh.
- Come...

27:07.919 --> 27:09.800
- Just go. Just go.
- My toe.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.000
Come on.

27:23.679 --> 27:25.000
- Whoa!
- Oh!

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
- Jesus. Jackson!
- Oh my gosh.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.880
- Shit. Sorry, sorry.
- Steady. Steady.

27:30.159 --> 27:31.320
Okay, slowly.

27:31.320 --> 27:34.159
- Just squeeze round...
- Going round, are we? Okay. Right.

27:34.159 --> 27:37.360
- Easy. Straighten her up.
- Guys, it's wonky. Straighten.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.679
- Fingers. Hold on.
- There.

28:04.600 --> 28:09.120
Welcome, everyone, and apologies
for that little musical hiccup,

28:09.120 --> 28:14.159
but I'm sure Erin's
singing her favorite song wherever she is.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.439
Hopefully.

28:17.199 --> 28:18.399
My name is Samantha.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.840
I'm your celebrant today.

28:20.840 --> 28:25.320
And we are gathered here
so that Erin Willy can continue--

28:25.320 --> 28:27.399
Wiley. Erin... Erin Wiley.

28:28.320 --> 28:29.800
- Wiley?
- Yep.

28:32.360 --> 28:33.919
It reads like Willy on the page.

28:33.919 --> 28:36.000
It quite clearly reads like Wiley.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.159
Mm-mm.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.640
...so that Erin Wiley

28:43.240 --> 28:46.600
can continue to live on in our memories.

28:47.159 --> 28:48.959
Erin was born in Moordale,

28:48.959 --> 28:51.720
and she is survived by two children.

28:51.720 --> 28:52.720
Three.

28:53.560 --> 28:54.480
Three children.

28:55.399 --> 28:59.159
Maeve, Sean, and Elsie...

28:59.840 --> 29:02.360
...who were
the light of her life.

29:03.959 --> 29:07.040
Being a single mum had its challenges.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.320
But she was the kind of woman

29:09.320 --> 29:12.840
who rose to the occasion
with energy and enthusiasm.

29:12.840 --> 29:14.360
What are you doing?

29:14.360 --> 29:15.480
Sorry I'm late.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Welcome.

29:19.040 --> 29:21.560
Ahem. Erin had a vibrant spirit...

29:21.560 --> 29:24.000
- Who are these people?
- I've been calling you for hours.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.280
She enjoyed listening to music,
talking to friends.

29:27.280 --> 29:28.600
And, you know,

29:29.240 --> 29:31.520
I think we can all take comfort

29:31.520 --> 29:36.199
in the idea
that there is a particularly bright

29:36.720 --> 29:40.280
new star in the sky tonight.

29:45.159 --> 29:46.240
This is great.

29:46.240 --> 29:49.879
This is... fab. It really...

29:49.879 --> 29:52.240
- I mean... I mean, it's complete crap.
- Shut up.

29:53.360 --> 29:56.240
But it is beautifully...
beautifully crafted.

29:56.840 --> 29:58.480
- Thank you.
- Stop it.

29:58.480 --> 30:01.560
- I actually think I might add to it.
- No. No, no, no. Sean.

30:01.560 --> 30:05.720
If you don't mind if I say a few words...

30:05.720 --> 30:07.040
- Thank you.
- Please don't.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.040
- About my mother.
- Sean.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.320
My darling mummy

30:14.480 --> 30:17.959
died doing what she loved.

30:21.560 --> 30:22.399
Drugs.

30:23.720 --> 30:27.679
Oh, come on. We weren't all buying that
"she's a bright star in the sky" stuff.

30:27.679 --> 30:29.159
Were we?

30:29.760 --> 30:32.159
No, I think it would actually be
much more appropriate

30:32.679 --> 30:34.360
if I, as her son,

30:34.360 --> 30:37.679
shared a few stories of Erin
from our childhood.

30:38.879 --> 30:41.360
Should I tell them about the games
we used to play?

30:42.879 --> 30:46.520
Shall I? Number one.
Ahem. Football in the dark.

30:46.520 --> 30:49.760
This was a good one, where Mum would
kick us out of our caravan

30:49.760 --> 30:51.199
in the middle of the night,

30:51.199 --> 30:55.600
so that she could get high
and then screw some guy called Greg.

30:55.600 --> 31:00.120
Then, there was, of course,
"ciggie hunting" or "hunt the cigarette,"

31:00.120 --> 31:02.480
which is when we used to go to the park

31:02.480 --> 31:06.439
and had to get on our hands and knees
and search in the mud for cigarette butts

31:06.439 --> 31:10.240
that were just long enough for Mum
to smoke 'cause we had run out of money.

31:11.720 --> 31:14.159
And then... I've got loads of these.
I can keep going.

31:14.159 --> 31:16.720
- There was my favorite--
- Stop it, Sean. That's enough.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.600
You're humiliating yourself.

31:24.320 --> 31:25.959
Come off it, sis.

31:28.639 --> 31:32.120
As if a fancy dress and a nice photo
is gonna convince anyone in this room

31:32.120 --> 31:34.800
that our mum was nothing
but a dirty junkie.

31:39.840 --> 31:40.760
Get out.

31:41.720 --> 31:42.800
Get out!

31:44.240 --> 31:46.600
Fine. With pleasure.

31:51.719 --> 31:52.560
Bye, Mum.

32:01.639 --> 32:05.120
I think we shall just take a little break.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.240
Sean.

32:11.639 --> 32:13.439
Sean, stop running away from me.

32:14.600 --> 32:18.040
- Why do you have to be so selfish?
- Because I can't be fake like you.

32:19.159 --> 32:22.280
- I'm trying to give her a nice send-off.
- It's not fair.

32:22.879 --> 32:25.560
- What's not fair?
- You're gonna get out of this place.

32:26.080 --> 32:28.879
But I'm gonna die alone, just like Mum.

32:29.959 --> 32:31.719
You can get yourself clean, Sean.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.240
Well, it doesn't really matter anyway

32:37.800 --> 32:41.040
because you're gonna go back
to your fancy little life in America

32:41.040 --> 32:42.560
and forget I exist.

32:43.320 --> 32:44.320
I'm leaving.

32:45.520 --> 32:47.800
Sean, don't do this.
We're saying goodbye to Mum.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.800
She didn't care about
saying goodbye to us, did she?

33:05.159 --> 33:06.199
Oh...

33:17.760 --> 33:21.840
<i>Customer announcement.
All tropical fish now half price.</i>

33:26.520 --> 33:29.120
This koala thing is so great.

33:29.120 --> 33:31.240
Look, she's already asleep.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.959
Hmm.

33:33.959 --> 33:34.959
Oh shit.

33:36.120 --> 33:38.520
- What are you doing?
- I'm hiding.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.320
- From who?
- From him.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.080
Oh my God, that's Dan! Shit.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.879
He must've really
had a motorbike accident.

33:44.879 --> 33:46.560
- How do you know Dan?
- What are you doing?

33:46.560 --> 33:47.840
How do you know Dan?

33:48.439 --> 33:50.399
That's the guy that I've been seeing.

33:51.919 --> 33:53.240
Fuck! Agh!

33:53.840 --> 33:54.959
Fucking hell.

33:56.959 --> 33:58.760
What?

33:59.719 --> 34:01.159
That's Joy's dad.

34:03.040 --> 34:06.879
- What, so you and Dan?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

34:08.719 --> 34:11.639
Well, how sure are you
about the whole dad thing?

34:11.639 --> 34:14.960
- Well, 95% sure.
- For fuck's sake!

34:14.960 --> 34:17.000
- You haven't slept with him, have you?
- No.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.040
I actually really quite like him.

34:21.679 --> 34:23.799
You know you can't see him anymore, right?

34:23.799 --> 34:26.040
Yes. Course.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.440
- Shit.
- Fucking typical.

34:51.679 --> 34:53.560
Oh. You're home early.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.159
You okay?

34:58.920 --> 35:00.880
I don't really wanna
talk about it right now.

35:02.360 --> 35:03.360
If that's all right.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.040
Okay.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Mmm.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.160
Can we have some cake?

35:31.160 --> 35:33.160
- Do you think she's okay?
- Hope so.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.799
- Hey, kids.
- Hi.

35:39.799 --> 35:41.760
Um, just so you know,

35:41.760 --> 35:44.760
um, I have another funeral this afternoon.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.200
So...

35:47.200 --> 35:48.480
Um...

35:50.200 --> 35:51.799
- Okay.
- Yeah.

35:51.799 --> 35:52.839
Mm-hmm.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.680
- I'm gonna look for her.
- Okay.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.600
It's all right.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.360
- How have you been?
- Good.

36:16.360 --> 36:17.400
Good.

36:19.200 --> 36:20.040
Hmm.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.040
I'm...

36:29.040 --> 36:30.280
working with horses now.

36:31.440 --> 36:32.319
Are you?

36:33.000 --> 36:35.520
Mmm.

36:38.560 --> 36:39.480
Did you, um...

36:41.440 --> 36:43.640
did you ever tell your parents?

36:46.280 --> 36:48.960
Yeah, uh... I have.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.560
They were pretty good about it.

36:55.080 --> 36:58.359
That's amazing, Adam.
That's... that's huge.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.640
I'm so proud of you, genuinely.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.359
I'm still findin' it really hard...

37:05.359 --> 37:07.280
- Mmm?
- Uh... to be...

37:07.280 --> 37:09.560
- To be fully out.
- Mmm.

37:10.160 --> 37:13.080
When did you stop feeling ashamed?

37:14.319 --> 37:18.200
Oh... it's a... it's a long road.

37:19.480 --> 37:20.560
Hmm.

37:20.560 --> 37:24.760
But, Adam, you... you have to believe
that you deserve good things.

37:25.280 --> 37:29.000
And, Adam, you <i>have</i> to love yourself.

37:29.799 --> 37:30.720
Mm-hmm.

37:37.880 --> 37:41.680
I know that we weren't... right together.

37:44.319 --> 37:45.600
But I do really miss you.

37:49.839 --> 37:52.920
You're completely... "effercrescent."

37:56.880 --> 37:59.520
Uh... Did you...
Sorry, um... do you mean effervescent?

38:00.480 --> 38:02.200
- Uh... yes, I did.
- Yeah.

38:03.839 --> 38:04.680
Yes, I did.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.000
Colin... Colin, no.

38:13.839 --> 38:15.120
What?

38:19.000 --> 38:20.040
I can't find her.

38:20.040 --> 38:22.560
What should we do?
Should we tell everyone to go home?

38:24.319 --> 38:26.280
No. She'll be back. I think.

38:26.280 --> 38:27.319
Okay.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.319
She keeps tappin' her watch at me.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.120
Found you.

39:04.720 --> 39:07.760
Do you think if I die of embarrassment,
I might get a discount?

39:08.640 --> 39:10.920
I can check the brochure, but I doubt it.

39:12.080 --> 39:14.040
I didn't need an audience in there.

39:14.839 --> 39:16.920
Aimee was just trying to help, you know.

39:29.839 --> 39:31.000
Your brother's in pain.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.480
She wasn't all bad.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.920
Of course she wasn't. No one's all bad.

39:39.440 --> 39:41.760
Look, this is fucking awful.

39:41.760 --> 39:46.440
And most people here won't understand
this dysfunctional family shit.

39:46.440 --> 39:49.240
But even though it's hard,
you wanted to honor Erin,

39:49.760 --> 39:52.080
and that's something
to be incredibly proud of.

39:55.400 --> 39:57.960
So get back in there
and tell them about your mum.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.280
Okay.

40:12.359 --> 40:13.640
- All right?
- Yeah.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.520
Um... Okay, folks, the break's over.

40:17.120 --> 40:22.640
We now have the eulogy, which is going
to be read by Erin's daughter, Maeve.

40:34.240 --> 40:35.240
Okay.

40:47.440 --> 40:48.839
Sorry.

40:53.280 --> 40:55.319
All that stuff my brother said is true.

40:56.240 --> 40:57.520
My mum was an addict.

40:59.520 --> 41:02.600
She also helped set up my first business
when I was eight years old,

41:02.600 --> 41:04.120
washing people's cars.

41:05.160 --> 41:07.480
She taught me how
to pick out returning customers

41:07.480 --> 41:08.760
and how to make good tips.

41:09.680 --> 41:12.600
She loved to sing,
even though she sang terribly

41:12.600 --> 41:14.400
and could never get the lyrics right.

41:15.359 --> 41:17.280
And...

41:18.200 --> 41:19.480
we never went hungry,

41:20.560 --> 41:22.359
which was no mean feat.

41:22.359 --> 41:25.560
Even when she was high,
she would make these, um...

41:25.560 --> 41:27.200
stupid pancakes for us,

41:27.200 --> 41:29.319
with chocolate smiley faces.

41:29.319 --> 41:30.359
Pretty good.

41:31.400 --> 41:34.160
And, yeah, I think...

41:34.680 --> 41:36.200
Sorry.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Yeah.

41:51.240 --> 41:55.319
Uh...
I think what I'm trying to say is that

41:55.319 --> 41:57.799
a mother can be
a pretty shit parent sometimes,

41:57.799 --> 42:01.960
and you can still love them
and want them to get better.

42:01.960 --> 42:06.440
And someone can be an addict
and still be generous and kind.

42:07.720 --> 42:11.200
Mmm, I really hate her
for everything she put me through, but...

42:13.200 --> 42:16.799
I also miss her...
with every cell of my being.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.200
Okay.

42:26.920 --> 42:30.319
So as our ceremony
comes to a close,

42:31.080 --> 42:33.359
and we all go back to our daily lives,

42:35.200 --> 42:37.680
I hope you've gained some comfort

42:38.680 --> 42:40.760
from us all being together today.

42:44.200 --> 42:45.480
Thank you.

42:54.319 --> 42:55.319
Do you know it?

42:57.080 --> 42:57.920
Yeah.

42:58.480 --> 42:59.720
Do you think... you...

43:00.240 --> 43:01.799
- I think.
- Mmm.

43:03.520 --> 43:04.600

46:04.560 --> 46:05.440
Hey.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.080
What's going on?

46:12.720 --> 46:13.839
I just had--

46:14.920 --> 46:17.120
Just wanted to check
everything was all right.

46:17.120 --> 46:18.319
Yeah, everything's fine.

46:20.520 --> 46:23.440
Um... I'll be there in a minute. Thank you.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.200
Yeah. Sure.

46:32.480 --> 46:34.080
What?

46:35.720 --> 46:36.920
I don't know, man.

46:37.440 --> 46:40.000
- I just think he's a bit weird.
- What, Beau?

46:42.520 --> 46:43.600
What are you sayin'?

46:44.120 --> 46:46.040
He's super intense, no?

46:48.640 --> 46:51.520
- Why you gettin' jealous?
- I'm not being jealous.

46:51.520 --> 46:54.160
I'm just worried that it's movin' so fast.

46:54.160 --> 46:56.560
- Okay. Well, Jackson, he's my boyfriend.
- Yeah.

46:56.560 --> 47:01.080
And I know you're going through
a tough time at the moment, but I'm happy.

47:05.120 --> 47:06.640
- All right. If you're sure.
- We good?

47:06.640 --> 47:08.640
- Yeah.
- Right, see you in there.

47:17.520 --> 47:19.839
- It was good to see you, man.
- You too.

47:21.359 --> 47:22.560
Take care, yeah?

47:26.799 --> 47:28.120
I'll have one after, yeah.

47:28.120 --> 47:29.640
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:29.640 --> 47:31.040
Aww.

47:36.040 --> 47:37.080
You all right, mate?

47:38.000 --> 47:39.359
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

47:39.359 --> 47:42.440
Was just, um...
just getting Viv's stuff for her.

47:42.440 --> 47:43.520
Hmm.

47:44.160 --> 47:45.000
'Scuse me.

47:53.280 --> 47:55.240
Hi, Jeffrey. Thanks for coming.

47:55.839 --> 47:57.560
Cynthia's sorry she's not here.

47:58.319 --> 48:00.359
Funerals remind her of Jonathan.

48:00.359 --> 48:02.720
Ah. Oh, of course, yeah.

48:03.879 --> 48:08.400
Your mum could be a bit of an arse,
but it's sad she died.

48:09.680 --> 48:12.120
And what you said up there was...

48:13.520 --> 48:14.680
was... was lovely.

48:18.400 --> 48:19.240
Thanks, Jeffrey.

48:21.760 --> 48:22.640
Hey.

48:22.640 --> 48:25.160
Hi. Thanks for coming.

48:25.160 --> 48:27.120
Maeve, I'm so sorry.

48:28.160 --> 48:29.280
How are you both?

48:29.280 --> 48:30.760
- Yeah, good. Um...
- Good, yeah.

48:30.760 --> 48:34.240
I'm still teaching,
and Emily's gone back to university.

48:34.240 --> 48:35.640
- Wow.
- Yeah,

48:35.640 --> 48:39.080
I... I'm doing, um...
a master's in literature.

48:39.680 --> 48:42.160
Yeah. Uh... You actually inspired me.

48:42.760 --> 48:44.960
- Really?
- Getting to study at Wallace.

48:44.960 --> 48:47.240
- It must be amazing.
- Yeah, hotshot.

48:47.240 --> 48:49.000
- Yeah.
- It's pretty incredible.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.920
I bet you're doing so well.
Top of your class in everything?

48:55.080 --> 48:56.080
Anyway, uh...

48:57.920 --> 49:02.240
I am just so unbelievably proud of you.

49:02.240 --> 49:04.560
Teaching you and watching you thrive

49:04.560 --> 49:06.600
when you've had
so much working against you

49:06.600 --> 49:11.160
has been one of
the greatest privileges of my career.

49:13.600 --> 49:14.680
Oh...

49:19.680 --> 49:20.520
Thank you.

49:21.560 --> 49:22.600
Thank you.

49:23.960 --> 49:26.600
- Get home safe. Enjoy the cupcakes.
- Yeah. Oh, we will.

49:26.600 --> 49:28.359
- Sorry he took two.
- Aimee Gibbs special.

49:34.120 --> 49:35.280
Okay.

49:38.760 --> 49:39.600
Bye, Maeve.

49:41.600 --> 49:43.200
I'm so sorry for your loss.

49:44.640 --> 49:46.760
Thanks. Enjoy the cupcakes.

49:49.480 --> 49:51.200
Thank you. Thanks for coming.

49:51.799 --> 49:52.640
Hey.

49:54.480 --> 49:55.680
Are we okay?

49:56.319 --> 49:59.839
Because I don't feel like
we need to fight. Can we just move on?

50:00.440 --> 50:02.080
Yeah, I don't know.

50:03.839 --> 50:05.040
I don't know.

50:06.640 --> 50:12.520
I just... I don't feel like
you really heard what I've said.

50:13.799 --> 50:16.520
Well, I... I don't feel like
you've heard what I've said.

50:22.319 --> 50:24.120
Okay. Uh...

50:28.799 --> 50:31.680
Maybe we need
some time apart from each other.

50:36.399 --> 50:37.240
Yeah.

50:38.520 --> 50:39.640
Yeah, maybe.

50:43.480 --> 50:45.120
Cool. Cool.

50:45.120 --> 50:47.040
I'll... see you around.

51:04.879 --> 51:05.760
How are you doing?

51:10.440 --> 51:11.359
Yeah.

51:14.760 --> 51:16.160
I know I fucked up.

51:16.160 --> 51:19.120
Okay, I'm... I am really sorry.

51:20.600 --> 51:24.080
I think I was just missing you a lot,
and I wanted to feel important,

51:24.080 --> 51:25.319
which is pathetic,

51:26.760 --> 51:31.359
and I'd hate for this to be the reason
that things didn't work out with us, so...

51:37.879 --> 51:38.760
Nothing happened?

51:40.120 --> 51:40.960
No.

51:42.000 --> 51:42.839
Promise?

51:43.879 --> 51:44.879
I promise.

51:47.960 --> 51:49.839
Do you wanna walk me home?

51:52.640 --> 51:53.520
Sure.

- Hey, Dad.

53:37.960 --> 53:41.879
That funeral made me feel... a bit weird,

53:41.879 --> 53:43.319
and I was thinking that

53:44.760 --> 53:46.200
maybe we could hang out.

53:46.200 --> 53:47.760
Ye... yeah, sure.

53:48.359 --> 53:49.399
Mm-hmm.

53:49.920 --> 53:51.879

53:52.680 --> 53:54.280
- Um
- Oh. Oh.

53:54.280 --> 53:57.960
Are... are you with that lady?
Sorry. Leave you to it.

54:03.319 --> 54:04.480
What's Mum's coat doin' here?

54:08.720 --> 54:10.000
Mum? Mum?

54:10.600 --> 54:12.359
- Mum, are you in there?
- No, no, she's not.

54:15.200 --> 54:17.920
Adam. Um... I... I was just...

54:18.720 --> 54:22.760
- I... I just dropped by to get... something.
- Uh... Yeah.

54:28.280 --> 54:30.799
Adam. Adam. Please, Adam...

54:38.440 --> 54:40.680
<i>How can we help you today, Nicky?</i>

54:40.680 --> 54:43.839
<i>My, um...
my teenager is non-binary,</i>

54:43.839 --> 54:46.120
<i>and, uh, when they turned 18,</i>

54:46.120 --> 54:50.200
<i>they went to a private doctor and...
and started taking testosterone.</i>

54:50.200 --> 54:53.040
<i>And... and now,
I think they want top surgery.</i>

54:53.040 --> 54:55.920
<i>And I want to understand,
so I can support them,</i>

54:55.920 --> 54:58.080
<i>but they just won't talk to me.</i>

54:58.080 --> 55:01.200
Have you had an open dialogue
with your child in the past?

55:02.720 --> 55:06.120
Yeah, I... I didn't react so well
when they first came out.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.399
<i>- I felt out of control.</i>
- Ah.

55:09.080 --> 55:12.520
Well, it sounds like there's been
a breakdown in the trust between you.

55:12.520 --> 55:15.200
<i>And that can take time to rebuild.</i>

55:15.200 --> 55:17.920
As a parent, I know it can be hard

55:17.920 --> 55:20.879
to feel like you're being shut out.

55:21.839 --> 55:26.000
But if you educate yourself
about what's going on for your child,

55:26.000 --> 55:27.760
then that could be hugely helpful.

55:27.760 --> 55:31.080
<i>I think you need to show
that you're serious</i>

55:31.080 --> 55:33.480
<i>about going on this journey with them</i>

55:33.480 --> 55:37.839
<i>and that they don't need
to keep explaining themselves to you.</i>

55:39.480 --> 55:41.040
<i>It's really important.</i>

55:41.040 --> 55:45.520
Letting them know
that you love them for who they are.

55:46.920 --> 55:51.319
And look, teenagers are always gonna have
stuff that they don't tell their parents.

55:51.319 --> 55:53.520
<i>But it's important
to create an environment</i>

55:53.520 --> 55:56.720
<i>where they feel safe enough
to bring things to you if they need to.</i>

55:56.720 --> 56:01.399
If you just try and stay open
and curious and compassionate,

56:01.399 --> 56:03.319
then I don't think you can go far wrong.

56:04.359 --> 56:06.600
<i>Thanks. That... that helps a lot.</i>

56:14.480 --> 56:17.640
Your results are just loading.

56:32.480 --> 56:34.359
The tests are clear, Mr. Marchetti.

56:35.240 --> 56:36.600
Your lump is not cancerous.

56:36.600 --> 56:38.000
- Ah!
- Oh!

56:38.000 --> 56:39.560
Thank fuck for that!

56:39.560 --> 56:41.879
- Mum!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

56:41.879 --> 56:44.720
I'm just very... very happy. Sorry.

56:47.440 --> 56:48.359
- Oh!
- Thank you.

56:48.359 --> 56:49.280

is Ruby.

57:40.240 --> 57:42.680
Hello, Ruby. What can we do for you today?

57:42.680 --> 57:44.680
<i>I have a question for O.</i>

57:44.680 --> 57:47.200
I just wanted to know what it feels like

57:47.200 --> 57:52.520
to pretend to be so nice and kind
and compassionate and helpful

57:52.520 --> 57:54.680
when really you're just a bully.

57:56.319 --> 57:57.560
I am so sorry, Ruby.

57:57.560 --> 58:00.600
I have absolutely no idea
what you're referring to.

58:00.600 --> 58:01.560
<i>Yes, you do.</i>

58:02.080 --> 58:06.399
And so will everyone else after they see
the video I've just tagged you in.

58:07.839 --> 58:10.520
No. No. Next... next... next caller.

58:10.520 --> 58:12.799
Uh, sorry about that, everyone.

58:12.799 --> 58:16.359
<i>So, we've got, um... Right. Okay.</i>

58:16.359 --> 58:21.319
Um, next call is from Rob.
Hello, Rob. What can I do to you... for you?

58:21.839 --> 58:23.279
<i>Bed wetter!</i>

59:39.399 --> 59:40.399
Who was that?

59:41.759 --> 59:42.640
Ellen.

59:43.520 --> 59:45.120
She's asking when I'm back.

59:48.680 --> 59:50.200
When are you going back?

59:53.520 --> 59:54.440
I don't know.

59:55.480 --> 59:57.359
I actually think I might stay here.

01:00:03.359 --> 01:00:04.520
What about your course?

01:00:07.279 --> 01:00:09.080
I just think I need some stability.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.919
- You said you loved being at Wallace.
- Yeah, but I missed you.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.160
I missed you too.

01:00:24.839 --> 01:00:27.480
You might not get
another chance like that.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.480
I wanna make sure
you're doing the right thing.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:32.279
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.
I just wanna be here with you.

01:00:56.919 --> 01:00:58.160
Shall we try again?

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:32.640
Mum?

01:01:35.839 --> 01:01:37.399
Mum, are you okay?

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:40.919
<i>I made you some toast.</i>

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.000
<i>Otis. Otis. Otis?</i>

01:01:45.879 --> 01:01:47.160
Otis, are you okay?

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.600
- Otis.
- Okay, stop.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.279
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

01:01:53.799 --> 01:01:55.560
I keep thinking about my mum.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.759
- You keep thinking about your mum?
- Yeah... No.

01:01:57.759 --> 01:02:00.960
I mean, not...
not in a sort of weird, creepy sexy way.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.640
- Why are you thinking about your mum?
- I don't know.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:07.359
I... I used to have
these problems with sex, and...

01:02:08.359 --> 01:02:11.720
I thought I... was over them and...

01:02:14.319 --> 01:02:17.720
Now I'm just really embarrassed,
and I wanna die, and...

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.600
I don't wanna die. Your mum just died.
I keep talking about mums.

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:25.000
Okay. Okay. Shush, please. It's fine.

01:02:26.319 --> 01:02:27.799
We don't have to do anything.

01:02:27.799 --> 01:02:29.480
Just lie down. Come on.

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.680
It's been a weird day.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.640
Yeah.

01:02:47.359 --> 01:02:48.399
Weird day.
