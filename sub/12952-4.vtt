01:11.570 --> 01:13.690
- There...you see that?
- No

01:15.740 --> 01:17.530
What do you mean? L...look there...

01:17.660 --> 01:20.330
he's saying...he's saying “Jule...or Julie...”

01:20.370 --> 01:21.950
He could be saying any number of things.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.830
I have already subjected this video

01:24.000 --> 01:26.960
to the most intense technological scrutiny available to the CIA.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.380
- Maybe Julia... 
- If you want me to do a reanalysis,

01:29.500 --> 01:32.380
fine, but you have to stop punishing yourself.

01:32.670 --> 01:34.670
There's gotta be something in there that can lead us to...

01:35.630 --> 01:37.720
Sydney, no good will come from doing this.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.510
I committed a murder I have no memory of;

01:39.550 --> 01:40.720
this isn't about punishment!

01:40.760 --> 01:42.720
I understand this haunts you, but you have to stop...

01:42.850 --> 01:45.770
Yes, it haunts me! I lost two years!

01:45.980 --> 01:49.230
I do not have one memory of that time; all I have is this.

01:49.350 --> 01:54.650
I killed a man...I killed a defenceless man in cold blood.

01:55.530 --> 01:57.860
What was I thinking? Did I know it was Sark's father?

01:57.990 --> 02:00.200
What would compel me to do something like this!?

02:00.320 --> 02:03.080
Did someone condition me?

02:03.080 --> 02:05.330
If they did... what else did they have me do?

02:05.910 --> 02:08.750
I've been living with these same questions of over a year.

02:09.789 --> 02:11.210
We have no answers yet.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.340
When you compelled the NSC to release me from prison,

02:14.460 --> 02:16.760
you told me you'd done so because...

02:17.300 --> 02:20.180
you needed your father; that you needed my strength.

02:21.050 --> 02:24.060
Twelve months in solitary would have an effect on anyone;

02:24.180 --> 02:30.150
something that allowed me to stay focused was your...strength.

02:31.650 --> 02:33.690
Don't lose it now...

02:39.200 --> 02:41.910
Hello?...Yeah.

02:42.780 --> 02:43.870
I'll be right there.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.620
That was Lauren...

02:49.710 --> 02:51.290
Twenty hours ago in Cannes...

02:51.380 --> 02:54.250
A four man team broke into an epidemiology lab.

02:54.420 --> 02:57.380
The place did cutting edge vaccine research into viruses

02:57.460 --> 02:59.760
like West Nile, HIV, and Ebola.

02:59.840 --> 03:00.510
What were they after?

03:00.590 --> 03:02.890
They took four vials containing strains of Ebola.

03:02.930 --> 03:05.930
The 5th was damaged during the heist, infecting one of the team members...

03:05.970 --> 03:06.770
The one we're questioning?

03:06.890 --> 03:08.930
Laszlo Bogdan, a Hungarian national.

03:09.020 --> 03:12.060
He's an expert at cracking high-end security systems.

03:12.190 --> 03:14.270
He's in isolation at the Stafford Naval Hospital.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.150
And the French just handed him over to us?

03:16.230 --> 03:18.990
Apparently they share our desire to learn more about the Covenant.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.320
Why did the NSC want me in on this?

03:21.410 --> 03:22.910
I wanted you...

03:23.320 --> 03:24.950
...Michael said you were the best.

03:45.010 --> 03:48.220
Mr. Bogdan, can you hear me?

03:50.980 --> 03:54.650
My name is Lauren Reed; I work for the United States Government.

03:56.110 --> 03:59.440
I've been sent here to find out whom you were working for.

03:59.940 --> 04:04.240
Who is responsible for putting you in the condition you're in now?

04:04.570 --> 04:05.820
Leave!

04:25.180 --> 04:33.140
Mr. Bogdan, I don't know what your beliefs are...if you have a faith...

04:34.350 --> 04:37.860
if you expect that something follows this life...

04:38.940 --> 04:40.690
You might have none.

04:42.740 --> 04:47.030
But if there is a chance that there is something else...

04:47.490 --> 04:54.290
that we face the consequences of our actions in this lifetime,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Mr. Bogdan

05:00.630 --> 05:05.340
This is your last chance...to do what's right.

05:07.050 --> 05:10.180
There's no one left to be afraid of...

05:10.680 --> 05:16.270
...no one to be loyal to. There's only yourself.

05:19.730 --> 05:26.820
Whoever it was who stole this virus that's eating through your body needs to be stopped.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.710
Please...

05:41.300 --> 05:45.420
I never met...the man who hired us...

05:51.470 --> 05:56.810
I...cannot help you stop...the second job...

06:03.780 --> 06:07.700
Agent Bristow got Bogdan to admit there is a second heist in the works.

06:07.780 --> 06:10.740
While we believe the stolen samples have already been delivered to the Covenant,

06:10.820 --> 06:13.790
Bogdan says they will not be used until after this second job.

06:13.870 --> 06:16.870
- He said they were planning to modify the virus.
- Why is that?

06:17.040 --> 06:21.460
We can assume what they've stolen is merely a precursor agent requiring further synthesis.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.670
Okay, does...everyone here speak Science?

06:24.760 --> 06:26.760
- Yeah...
- No...Marshall... they don't...

06:26.840 --> 06:28.840
Oh...sorry...I could...help...explain...

06:28.840 --> 06:30.300
That'd be great...

06:30.180 --> 06:34.640
Okay...  Okay, well, um...what they nabbed, we'll call that...

06:34.970 --> 06:38.890
um, peanut butter...you know... yummy, nutty, creamy deliciousness

06:39.020 --> 06:43.650
...on its own, but you, um, mix something else in equally tasty...oh!

06:43.690 --> 06:45.110
Perhaps chocolat...

06:46.610 --> 06:52.370
Sorry...they're most likely going after the means to mutate the virus to make it even more infectious...

06:52.530 --> 06:56.290
Ebola is a level 4 pathogen; that's the highest classification...

06:56.330 --> 06:57.700
How could it be any worse!?

06:57.700 --> 07:01.210
They could...make it...airborne...

07:02.210 --> 07:05.000
And we have no idea what the Covenant's endgame is.

07:05.090 --> 07:09.170
No. But we do know who the team is they hired for these jobs...

07:10.090 --> 07:14.430
Simon Walker...point man on the Damascus armory job in 99...

07:14.560 --> 07:16.640
and the 2002 break-in at Vector.

07:16.770 --> 07:20.270
Cold-blooded contract guy;only uses other freelancers.

07:20.350 --> 07:26.610
This time his team included Javier Perez, former Lieutenant in Cuban Special Forces;

07:26.900 --> 07:30.200
munitions expert and tactical advisor to the group.

07:30.280 --> 07:34.200
Avery Russet, acquisitions...vehicles, equipment, weapons.

07:34.280 --> 07:40.710
Finally, Laszlo Bogdan, security... deceased as of twenty minutes ago...

07:41.960 --> 07:43.880
We know there's another heist in the works;

07:44.040 --> 07:46.300
Mr. Walker will need a replacement.

07:48.170 --> 07:51.380
You want me to take Bogdan's place on their team.

07:51.550 --> 07:53.720
Walker's already been picked up on Echelon.

07:53.800 --> 07:54.890
We know he's in the market...

07:54.930 --> 08:00.060
It's deep cover. The risks are obvious...but this is an opportunity.

08:00.230 --> 08:03.440
The Covenant will take possession of whatever the team steals.

08:03.560 --> 08:08.980
If you can place a tracking device on that, we believe it will lead us to their center of operations.

08:09.070 --> 08:12.950
Walker's in Sevilla; you'll go in as a freelance security expert.

08:13.030 --> 08:14.450
Vaughn and Weiss, you're on backup.

08:14.570 --> 08:18.490
Lauren, I want you to go see Sloane; have him use his contacts...

08:18.580 --> 08:22.410
find out what they're after. You leave in two hours.

08:31.170 --> 08:32.929
I'll come by after op-tech.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.760
Oh, hey, real quick.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.559
The report you wrote on the infiltration of the COG bunker?

08:38.600 --> 08:41.309
You didn't give any details on the weapons that Sark was using...

08:42.230 --> 08:44.900
Uh, no I didn't...but that's not really the point of the report.

08:45.270 --> 08:45.940
Well...

08:46.060 --> 08:47.020
That's the point of the report!?

08:47.110 --> 08:49.270
Well, it's not the point...but it's important...

08:49.650 --> 08:52.150
How is it important? We broke into the bunker and destroyed the facility...

08:52.240 --> 08:54.200
Honey, you know how much I depend on the details...

08:54.280 --> 08:55.410
its how I form my questions I need to...

08:55.450 --> 08:57.070
- Who cares about the weapons!?
- I care!

08:57.120 --> 08:59.910
- I've been doing this for a long time!
- All I'm asking is that you be more specific...

08:59.950 --> 09:01.370
I've never gotten notes on my reports before...

09:01.450 --> 09:03.910
The better you do your job; the better I'll do mine...

09:10.960 --> 09:13.720
It was a CZ 100 9 millimeter.

09:30.150 --> 09:32.860
We can't risk them picking up any stray radio transmissions,

09:32.940 --> 09:34.860
so I'll be monitoring you with a laser mic;

09:34.990 --> 09:37.820
I'll be able to hear you, but you won't be able to communicate with me.

09:38.870 --> 09:39.320
What's this?

09:39.410 --> 09:42.830
That's the tracking device. Marshall put a transmitter chip there on the back.

09:42.830 --> 09:43.620
There's an adhesive.

09:43.660 --> 09:45.500
Now, assuming Simon accepts you into the group,

09:45.580 --> 09:49.330
you'll use that to tag whatever it is you're gonna be stealing, and we'll track it back to the Covenant.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.300
You know, peach isn't really in this season.

09:57.050 --> 09:58.720
I heard peach was the new green.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.050
I thought beige was the new green...

10:00.180 --> 10:01.930
No, beige is the new peach.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.900
You've got a lot of reading to do...

11:15.630 --> 11:17.920
You can't go up. Private party.

11:18.670 --> 11:20.220
Let me make it worth your while.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.590
No, the gentlemen inside already have.

11:22.590 --> 11:25.430
- I'm losing the signal!
- I'm aiming the mic right at her...

11:25.470 --> 11:26.770
I should have worn the ring...

11:26.850 --> 11:28.930
Get over yourself, okay? No one aims the mic like I do...

11:29.020 --> 11:30.560
Please, walk away for your own good...

11:30.640 --> 11:31.940
...or I'll have to accompany you.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.280
Excuse me, ma'am.

11:40.780 --> 11:43.280
Mr Walker would like to speak to you

11:44.580 --> 11:45.780
Gracias.

12:05.220 --> 12:06.890
Good to see you, Julia.

12:09.180 --> 12:11.100
Good to see you, too.

12:42.670 --> 12:45.090
It's not an alias she's ever used with us before...

12:45.090 --> 12:47.010
There's no mention of a Julia in her SD-6 files...

12:47.010 --> 12:50.720
Right. Which means, last two years, when she was supposedly being held by the Covenant...

12:50.850 --> 12:52.480
What... You think she was operational!?

12:52.600 --> 12:54.350
I think this guy just called her Julia...

12:54.730 --> 12:56.400
Where in the bloody hell have you been?

12:57.400 --> 12:59.440
Isn't that the question of the day?

13:00.110 --> 13:02.860
Oh, come on, I know you can do better than that...

13:02.950 --> 13:04.820
A girl's gotta have some secrets...

13:05.860 --> 13:09.490
All right, look, all right, at least tell me what's with the new look...

13:11.700 --> 13:14.250
I barely recognized you...

13:14.580 --> 13:16.210
I hope you weren't disappointed...

13:17.210 --> 13:22.010
No. No...but I've missed you...Julia...

13:23.050 --> 13:26.010
Uh, you know...I've missed working with you...

13:28.220 --> 13:30.100
Why do you think I came back?

13:32.520 --> 13:35.730
You're a right nutter, you are...

13:37.150 --> 13:38.230
I heard about Bogdan...

13:39.400 --> 13:45.780
Yeah....that was too bad. Now, you never met Bogdan?

13:47.200 --> 13:49.160
Yeah, you'd have liked him.

13:53.580 --> 13:55.250
I wanna take his place.

13:56.420 --> 14:01.420
Well, as it happens, we do have a job coming up...but Bogdan was security...

14:02.050 --> 14:03.010
I know.

14:06.590 --> 14:08.970
What? No future in murder?

14:10.140 --> 14:14.310
I am...a girl with many talents...

14:16.690 --> 14:18.400
And I'm your man.

14:23.610 --> 14:25.490
Tell us what you know about Simon Walker.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.570
We know he's on a job for the Covenant, but we don't know what he's after.

14:29.200 --> 14:33.200
This details the first of what we believe to be two related heists.

14:33.290 --> 14:36.120
We think that whatever the Covenant has hired Mr. Walker

14:36.160 --> 14:40.290
to obtain will in some way augment the virus they stole earlier this week.

14:42.380 --> 14:48.800
I must admit, I was concerned for you when Sydney resurfaced...

14:49.890 --> 14:51.970
I remembered seeing her with Vaughn...

14:52.100 --> 14:55.350
their relationship reminded me my own with my late wife...

14:55.850 --> 15:00.850
It was the kind of...bond...that even death cannot sever.

15:02.060 --> 15:05.320
Hmmm. Well, apparently I misjudged.

15:06.360 --> 15:10.410
Whatever information you can uncover will be greatly appreciated...

15:10.530 --> 15:13.080
Ah, Ms. Reed...you shouldn't doubt yourself.

15:13.240 --> 15:19.330
You're very good at what you do...despite how you got the job...

15:23.000 --> 15:25.050
What does that mean?

15:29.220 --> 15:32.140
I'll see what I can do, hmm?

15:39.980 --> 15:44.690
Meet the fellas...Avery, Javier...this is Julia.

15:46.280 --> 15:49.320
I can see why you wanted her along...

15:49.490 --> 15:51.450
There's no time for small talk.

15:52.280 --> 15:55.700
Oh, I know...  Are you ready?

15:56.740 --> 15:57.910
For what?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.830
Look, you used to say you were ready for anything...

16:15.010 --> 16:16.220
Let's go.

16:23.770 --> 16:26.730
Princess Demetria is in town on holiday...

16:27.230 --> 16:28.570
How nice for her...

16:29.110 --> 16:32.570
The Spanish royal family is throwing a party in her honor tomorrow night...

16:32.700 --> 16:34.950
...and in typical Demetria fashion,

16:35.070 --> 16:39.410
she plans on sporting a hundred and fifty carat diamond necklace...

16:40.500 --> 16:45.580
Pity really, because it's up in the penthouse with her right now, gathering dust in a safe...

16:45.670 --> 16:46.960
You want me to steal it...

16:47.090 --> 16:48.920
Well, consider it your interview...

16:49.300 --> 16:52.590
I'd like to see you wearing that necklace...

16:52.760 --> 16:54.220
Just the necklace, right?

17:03.770 --> 17:06.359
You want me to steal the necklace with this!?

17:06.440 --> 17:08.109
We have...something else for you...

17:08.319 --> 17:09.940
Get me the police.

17:11.609 --> 17:13.450
Well, look...they don't trust you yet...

17:13.490 --> 17:15.700
and I'm not sure I do, either...

17:15.700 --> 17:18.990
There's a robbery in progress at the Hotel Sevilla.

17:19.119 --> 17:21.950
The police will be here...in about 7 minutes...

17:49.190 --> 17:51.280
You really think she's that good?

17:52.360 --> 17:54.820
Oh yes...well, she used to be...

18:02.660 --> 18:04.330
Turn-down service?

18:04.750 --> 18:05.620
No.

18:11.170 --> 18:12.420
We should call ‘em off!

18:12.420 --> 18:15.220
We do that, they'll know Syd's got a tail... there's nothing we can do.

18:34.820 --> 18:35.690
Una problema?

18:35.690 --> 18:37.990
We received a call that you're being robbed.

18:38.110 --> 18:40.120
Please have a look around.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.870
We're going to investigate.

20:32.980 --> 20:35.150
Whatever she just did, man...

20:35.230 --> 20:37.690
She's good...she is really good...

20:42.070 --> 20:44.360
I had time for a swim...

20:50.620 --> 20:54.330
Right...I've got a meeting in Paris tomorrow night;

20:54.370 --> 20:57.340
we'll meet at the safehouse on Thursday to spec out the mission...

20:59.510 --> 21:01.840
Here's the tech you'll need...

21:02.550 --> 21:04.090
Well, welcome to the team...

21:10.270 --> 21:13.140
I need to learn how to crack an S305 safe...

21:13.230 --> 21:15.190
Weiss is on with Marshall, approving the specs for you...

21:23.240 --> 21:27.280
Okay, I know you think this op is too dangerous for me to continue...

21:27.370 --> 21:31.040
Yes, I do...  ...but that's not what I was gonna say.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.290
So...What?

21:33.790 --> 21:36.880
I've never worked with anyone who can improvise better than you can...

21:37.580 --> 21:40.050
but when Simon called you Julia...

21:40.130 --> 21:42.210
your reaction...you didn't seem surprised.

21:42.590 --> 21:44.680
No...tell me what's going on.

21:47.850 --> 21:50.680
Look, I know we're not where we were...

21:50.760 --> 21:53.560
but even before then, professionally, we never kept secrets from each other.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.060
I'm still on your side...

21:56.400 --> 21:59.270
You're right...we're not where we were.

22:01.900 --> 22:05.110
And trust me when I tell you, I am doing you a favor by keeping you out of it.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.700
No, that is not gonna work with me...

22:06.950 --> 22:08.410
It's gonna have to...

22:08.780 --> 22:12.200
I can't afford to make a distinction between professional and personal;not in my life.

22:12.290 --> 22:15.460
I mean, this job took two years from me. Everything is personal.

22:18.250 --> 22:20.500
As much as I wish I could trust you...

22:23.090 --> 22:26.590
the responsibilities you have now require me not to.

22:26.720 --> 22:30.050
Responsibilities!? What the hell does that mean!? What...Lauren!?

22:31.220 --> 22:33.140
What, because she's NSC, or because she's my wife!?

22:33.270 --> 22:34.930
Or is that distinction irrelevant!?

22:38.810 --> 22:44.820
I'm not punishing you... You think I am...I'm not.

22:52.530 --> 22:55.290
What? Somebody die?

22:59.920 --> 23:01.790
He pumped my contact...

23:02.710 --> 23:06.010
apparently by disabling the power, we're going to alert off-site security.

23:06.840 --> 23:08.220
We have a bigger problem...

23:08.970 --> 23:10.970
What's that?

23:11.300 --> 23:12.350
Julia...

23:21.860 --> 23:24.270
Vaughn's been quizzing me about Julia.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.940
I tried shutting down his inquiry, but apparently...

23:27.240 --> 23:29.450
something you said has made that impossible.

23:29.530 --> 23:31.450
All I said was that I couldn't talk about it.

23:31.570 --> 23:33.740
Which, of course, has only peaked his interest.

23:33.830 --> 23:38.910
What peaked his interest was hearing Simon Walker call me Julia and then kiss me like his prom date!

23:39.580 --> 23:41.500
I can't compel Vaughn to stop being curious.

23:41.580 --> 23:46.960
I don't need to remind you of the consequence if Lauren and the NSC connect you to the assassination of Lazarey.

23:47.170 --> 23:53.800
They will subject you to detailed, invasive and painful procedures in the name of extracting your lost memory.

23:53.850 --> 23:56.970
Yes, all of that could happen...And you know, at this point,

23:57.020 --> 23:59.850
I'm starting to think that might be a good thing...

24:01.770 --> 24:04.650
I'm thinking maybe I should have let them hook me up when I first got back...

24:04.730 --> 24:11.360
find out what they could...because, however painful that would be...

24:11.660 --> 24:13.910
it couldn't be as painful as not knowing.

24:14.450 --> 24:16.580
Yes, it can.

24:18.250 --> 24:20.040
Okay, now I figured out how to crack that safe...

24:20.080 --> 24:21.370
that you have to crack.

24:21.460 --> 24:25.040
I got this idea during Carrie's last ultrasound... Check this out.

24:25.590 --> 24:26.670
You ready? Okay, now, um...

24:26.750 --> 24:33.220
now while the software manipulates the voltage to crack the encryption algorithm...

24:33.680 --> 24:37.640
...this monitors the locking mechanism by using imaging and audio it hears...

24:37.720 --> 24:39.600
It's like an x-ray and stethoscope in one.

24:39.730 --> 24:43.150
So once I rewire the keypad and attach the probe, the software will do the rest.

24:43.230 --> 24:44.770
Yeah, it shouldn't take longer than a couple of minutes.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.320
Now, I know what you're wondering...boy or girl?

24:47.400 --> 24:49.230
Well, she won't tell me...

24:49.360 --> 24:51.570
- Marshall, I don't know!
- She knows.

24:51.860 --> 24:54.240
That's okay, though, because I've come up with a solution...

24:54.360 --> 24:57.370
to solve...this predicament... Unisex names.

24:57.450 --> 25:01.250
Jody, Sam, Alex, Andy, Francis, Frank...

25:01.330 --> 25:04.920
that could be with a “ph”  Randy, Terry, Jan, Don...

25:05.080 --> 25:09.420
Ms. Bristow?  Director would like to see you in his office.

25:12.840 --> 25:13.630
Excuse me.

25:15.010 --> 25:17.930
You know...I could find out right now...

25:18.060 --> 25:19.930
Touch me with that thing and you die!

25:20.680 --> 25:22.020
Do you know what this is about?

25:22.100 --> 25:22.430
No.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.730
Your father showed me your videotape.

25:29.780 --> 25:30.480
What videotape?

25:31.150 --> 25:37.120
The videotape that clearly identifies Sydney as the murderer of a Russian diplomat, Adrian Lazarey.

25:38.950 --> 25:41.290
Your father has also informed me that since you returned,

25:41.450 --> 25:49.000
you've conspired to keep this information from both this CIA and the NSC because you were afraid you'd be pulled off active duty.

25:51.630 --> 25:54.680
Agent Vaughn, you weren't aware of any of this?

25:54.680 --> 25:55.680
No, sir.

25:57.760 --> 26:02.600
I agree with Jack that your complicity in Lazarey's murder may not have been voluntary.

26:02.680 --> 26:07.480
And seeing as you have no memory of the incident, it's premature to pass judgment.

26:07.560 --> 26:12.320
Sydney, Jack...if I find out you've concealed any more information from me,

26:12.400 --> 26:15.530
you will feel the full weight of this office bearing down on you.

26:16.030 --> 26:19.320
That said, we in too deep with the current operation.

26:19.410 --> 26:23.870
We can't allow the Covenant to get their hands on bio-weapons.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.790
So, you're going back in as scheduled.

26:25.830 --> 26:26.920
Yes, sir.

26:27.080 --> 26:31.170
Given my discretion to compartmentalize information during an ongoing operation,

26:31.170 --> 26:34.300
I'm withholding this information from the NSC.

26:34.800 --> 26:40.260
That means, Agent Vaughn, that you are prohibited from discussing any of this with your wife.

26:41.010 --> 26:42.510
Is that understood?

26:43.520 --> 26:44.770
Yeah.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.020
You wanna tell me what that was about!?

26:50.150 --> 26:51.820
I thought you said we need to keep this secret!

26:51.900 --> 26:54.230
Yes, from the NSC...which is what we've done.

26:54.530 --> 26:57.530
You knew Dixon would order Vaughn to keep this from Lauren...

26:57.570 --> 26:59.490
If the NSC found out, I'd be pulled.

26:59.530 --> 27:01.490
In time, you would have come to the same conclusion.

27:01.530 --> 27:03.910
Maybe, yes, but I wouldn't have acted on it.

27:04.040 --> 27:08.040
The last thing I want is to be responsible for driving a wedge between Vaughn and Lauren.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.210
That is a concern I do not share.

27:23.060 --> 27:24.680
- How was Sloane?
- It was okay...

27:24.720 --> 27:25.720
You're off?

27:25.850 --> 27:28.980
Me, too.  Aren't we the jet set couple?

27:32.690 --> 27:34.690
You were right about before; those details do matter;

27:34.690 --> 27:36.740
- I shouldn't leave them out...
- It's okay...

27:38.530 --> 27:40.070
I miss you.

27:49.210 --> 27:51.830
I knew she couldn't be trusted...

27:52.000 --> 27:56.050
She never went to Milan...She was with him...

28:23.780 --> 28:25.120
Vaughn?

28:27.620 --> 28:29.450
What my dad did...

28:30.040 --> 28:33.880
I never wanted you to have to keep secrets from Lauren.

28:39.800 --> 28:44.850
Well, now I do...  And for the record, I still think this is insane...

28:44.850 --> 28:46.180
I know...

28:46.310 --> 28:48.720
...that you're going back to a man who...knows you as a different person!

28:48.810 --> 28:51.850
If this was just about finding the Covenant, I might agree with you.

28:52.020 --> 28:54.060
But Vaughn, I have to know...

28:54.480 --> 28:57.770
Where I was...and who Julia is...

28:59.490 --> 29:01.820
What I did...

29:06.530 --> 29:09.160
Laser mic's in place. We're good to go.

29:15.670 --> 29:18.050
I'll talk to you when this is over.

29:34.230 --> 29:36.230
Well...how was Milan?

29:36.310 --> 29:41.900
We're good. I got everything we need.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.200
Just you and me?

29:52.450 --> 29:54.000
Sit down.

29:56.210 --> 29:59.460
So, tell me Julia...and don't be coy...

30:00.170 --> 30:03.590
before...when you disappeared...where the hell'd you go?

30:03.670 --> 30:05.930
Why....did you miss me?

30:08.510 --> 30:10.060
I did.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.820
What did you miss?

30:34.500 --> 30:38.830
...you had certain...specific qualities...

30:46.720 --> 30:54.930
Like what? The first time you saw me...what did you think?

30:59.690 --> 31:02.570
What...you mean in Algeria?

31:08.660 --> 31:09.950
Oh, do you remember?

31:10.120 --> 31:12.620
We almost died in that godforsaken place...

31:14.290 --> 31:17.460
We...couldn't keep our hands off each other...

31:30.090 --> 31:36.600
...I thought to myself...now there is a very beautiful woman...

31:40.400 --> 31:42.940
who knows how to deceive!

31:44.900 --> 31:46.940
You never went to Milan!

31:47.150 --> 31:48.450
No, man...you can't go!

31:48.490 --> 31:50.200
- I'm not going to just let her die!
- Give her a chance!

31:50.280 --> 31:52.870
...to tell me, who the hell you're working for!

31:53.160 --> 31:55.540
I'm working for myself, you son of a bitch!

31:57.200 --> 31:58.910
Who's this!?

32:01.670 --> 32:03.210
It's my supplier.

32:03.210 --> 32:05.920
Your supplier? What's his name?

32:06.630 --> 32:08.880
You lie to me again and I will kill you...

32:11.510 --> 32:14.680
- That's Michael Vaughn...He's my supplier...
-Oh my God, that's a picture of me...

32:14.680 --> 32:16.390
Come on, Simon! What the hell!?

32:16.850 --> 32:17.930
What, you don't believe me!?

32:18.020 --> 32:20.100
No! No, sweetheart, I don't!

32:23.900 --> 32:24.820
Flinkman residence...

32:24.860 --> 32:27.070
Marshall, this is Vaughn. Listen to me very carefully.

32:27.190 --> 32:30.530
I need you to upload to Interpol database immediately a criminal record

32:30.570 --> 32:34.660
with my name and photograph with at least 20 charges, all of them security based.

32:34.740 --> 32:36.620
Got it, got it, got it... Security stocks or security alarm systems?

32:36.790 --> 32:37.700
Alarm systems...

32:37.870 --> 32:39.080
Why did you head to the States!?

32:39.200 --> 32:43.040
Because the alarm system you're asking me to disable is from Chicago...

32:43.170 --> 32:45.960
That's Illinois...That's the United States!

32:46.040 --> 32:48.010
Milan wasn't gonna help us, you freak!

32:50.050 --> 32:51.590
That's your supplier?

32:52.550 --> 32:56.390
Check his records. Security is all he does...

32:56.680 --> 32:59.770
Do a search for a criminal profile with someone with security-related felons!

32:59.810 --> 33:00.980
Please would be nice...

33:00.980 --> 33:02.600
Uh, sorry... Please? My love?

33:07.320 --> 33:08.940
Is Marshall gonna be able to do this in time?

33:09.070 --> 33:11.240
- We gonna be able to do this in time?
- We're doing the best we can...

33:11.280 --> 33:12.740
Got it. Transferring now.

33:14.570 --> 33:17.990
That's good...change that...

33:27.710 --> 33:29.550
Okay...almost there...

33:29.550 --> 33:30.840
one second, one second...

33:30.840 --> 33:31.880
- Stop bouncing!
- Sorry.

33:31.880 --> 33:34.930
Hang on, uploading. Okay, done!

33:42.310 --> 33:44.020
Um...babe...

33:46.060 --> 33:47.860
Now I remember why I left...

34:02.370 --> 34:03.870
She's good.

34:05.210 --> 34:06.000
Okay.

34:08.250 --> 34:14.260
We're hitting a storage facility 35 miles outside of Saragosa run by the Disease Control Ministry.

34:14.340 --> 34:18.469
Now, to get in, we have to cut the power, which is gonna trigger an off-site security response.

34:18.550 --> 34:21.310
This gives us five minutes to get in, get the package and get out.

34:21.429 --> 34:23.639
Our target's a biological agent.

34:26.730 --> 34:33.150
Hello? Good...yeah, come in.  Take over...

34:34.739 --> 34:39.159
Inside the box is a small canister the size of a fist, which we'll be transferring to portable cooler.

34:39.489 --> 34:41.989
Now, keep in mind, once you've opened the safe,

34:42.120 --> 34:45.330
you only have one minute to remove the canister before it self-destructs,

34:45.580 --> 34:48.420
which means the transfer should be smooth...and instantaneous.

34:48.540 --> 34:49.880
The shift rotation's been changed.

34:50.920 --> 34:52.750
We'll have to adjust our timetables accordingly.

34:53.710 --> 34:55.510
But that shouldn't change any of our plans.

34:56.760 --> 34:59.430
Is your team aware of the fragile nature of the item?

34:59.850 --> 35:00.850
Yeah.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.850
By my calculations, we'll have to move everything up three hours...

35:02.850 --> 35:06.600
- Can I study these?
- I know you're hiding something...

35:07.190 --> 35:11.480
When you recover the item, contact me, and we'll exchange it for the remainder of your fee.

35:12.150 --> 35:13.360
Now that's sporting...

35:14.030 --> 35:15.030
Good luck.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.370
I think I have the information you asked for.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.160
Good.

35:23.080 --> 35:27.580
The second job...what the Covenant was trying to acquire.

35:27.750 --> 35:30.500
It's an artificial pathogen.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.590
If they combine this with the virus they stole last week,

35:33.710 --> 35:39.680
they will be able to genetically tailor a biological weapon for specific targets.

35:40.340 --> 35:44.220
A designer bomb that would be effective against only the targets they chose...

35:44.260 --> 35:45.100
Precisely.

35:47.730 --> 35:52.440
I suppose I should come clean with you...that thing I said the other day;

35:52.520 --> 35:56.280
that comment I made about...how you got the job...

35:57.490 --> 36:01.570
I was referring to the Senator...your father.

36:02.620 --> 36:04.240
What about my father?

36:04.580 --> 36:07.660
Well, he knew how badly you wanted to become field rated,

36:07.750 --> 36:12.040
and he thought it was too dangerous, so he made sure it didn't happen.

36:16.550 --> 36:19.380
But you knew that...didn't you?

36:20.760 --> 36:25.890
I know what you're doing...the way you manipulate people...

36:27.100 --> 36:29.850
...don't do it to me.

36:41.950 --> 36:43.450
You're not on the list.

36:46.030 --> 36:48.160
What are the inventory numbers?

36:52.790 --> 36:55.380
It'll take me a minute to hack into central security...

36:55.460 --> 36:58.550
Shutting the power off...We have access to building three.

36:58.710 --> 37:00.630
We've got five minutes before their guards show up.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.860
Julia, you're up.

37:56.150 --> 37:57.520
Babe, what's the problem?

37:57.860 --> 38:01.030
Standard Algorithm Decryption should have worked, I'll need to map their security.

38:00.730 --> 38:02.360
- How long will that take?
- I don't know.

38:02.400 --> 38:03.990
You only have thirty seconds left...

38:12.000 --> 38:13.580
I knew we couldn't rely on her...

38:13.660 --> 38:15.830
Keep your mouth shut and maybe we'll walk out of here...

38:19.420 --> 38:21.340
Julia...three seconds...

38:30.390 --> 38:33.560
They customized the hardware...not exactly factory condition.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.190
Nothing I couldn't handle...

38:56.210 --> 38:59.210
Security will be here in two minutes...let's go.

39:17.810 --> 39:19.100
What's this?

39:19.310 --> 39:21.570
Switching vehicles...in case we've been followed...

39:46.300 --> 39:48.430
We've a little surprise for ya...

40:01.650 --> 40:03.190
- Vaughn's missing!
- What happened?

40:03.230 --> 40:05.650
I was doing an overlook, I planted a mic...I got back and he's gone!

40:05.730 --> 40:07.320
You're scheduled to meet Sydney at the extraction point.

40:07.400 --> 40:08.820
No, I am not leaving my partner!

40:08.900 --> 40:11.700
A tac unit based out of Barcelona has already been deployed;

40:11.820 --> 40:13.830
you will meet Sydney at the extraction point!

40:14.700 --> 40:17.160
This is what I meant! He's got CIA issue equipment!

40:17.290 --> 40:19.960
Simon, I swear to you this man is my supplier!

40:20.040 --> 40:22.000
Not anymore...  Come here...

40:23.710 --> 40:25.300
You've got to get rid of them both!

40:25.340 --> 40:27.840
That's enough out of you! Julia's with us.

40:27.880 --> 40:29.720
It's this one who's the problem, not her...

40:31.260 --> 40:33.350
Wait!...Wait...

40:34.680 --> 40:39.180
If he's been lying to me all this time...he's put me in danger!

40:39.850 --> 40:44.190
I wanna do it.  I wanna do it!

41:02.370 --> 41:04.920
You never should have betrayed me...

41:35.120 --> 41:37.120
Julia...let's move.

41:38.305 --> 41:44.319
