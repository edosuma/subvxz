00:03.004 --> 00:05.290
(walkers snarling )

00:23.107 --> 00:25.814
(snarling )

00:46.464 --> 00:48.921
Do not fire
that weapon.

00:52.053 --> 00:54.886
( chuckles )
Shit.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.297
Look at what we got here.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.232
Oh, honey, look at you.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.654
You're a damn mess.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.446
Damn it.

01:14.617 --> 01:16.403
Shit.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.416
Can I borrow
that a sec?

01:25.586 --> 01:26.996
Thanks.

01:29.465 --> 01:31.626
Oh, I'm not leaving
you out.

01:34.929 --> 01:37.090
There's some rags
in the back.

01:43.062 --> 01:44.848
What?

01:46.023 --> 01:48.685
- What?
- Never seen that before.

01:52.947 --> 01:55.654
I've seen you
do the same thing.

01:55.825 --> 01:57.406
You smiled.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.828
You were smiling.

02:03.124 --> 02:05.285
Well, I'm the...

02:06.627 --> 02:08.618
luckiest guy in the world.

02:10.423 --> 02:13.290
How about you help me
with one of these cars?

02:13.467 --> 02:15.549
We got some miles to go.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.130
(theme music playing )

02:59.513 --> 03:01.970
( laughs)

03:06.020 --> 03:09.183
Do you have something to say
about my extremely comfortable

03:09.357 --> 03:11.518
and attractive shirt?

03:11.692 --> 03:14.775
No, no, no.
It looks great.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.442
Oh, you missed a...

03:27.041 --> 03:29.157
| wish we had
some soy milk.

03:29.335 --> 03:30.620
Seriously?

03:30.795 --> 03:32.706
Yes, seriously.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.120
Have you ever tried it?

03:34.298 --> 03:36.334
My best friend
in third grade,

03:36.509 --> 03:38.545
- he was allergic to dairy.
- Uh-huh.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.802
And every day he would bring
this soy stuff to lunch.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.508
- I tried it.
- And?

03:43.682 --> 03:45.968
- I threw up.
- Oh, yeah, right.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.350
All right, all right.
I almost threw up.

03:48.521 --> 03:51.103
But I was like, ugh.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.400
- ( laughs )
- It was so gross.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.684
I mean, literally,
I would rather have powdered milk

03:56.862 --> 03:58.727
than to have to drink
that stuff again.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.192
I would rather have
Judith's formula--

04:06.914 --> 04:08.870
I'm gonna go
finish my book.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.202
l have a couple
chapters left.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.092
Thank you.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.437
I heard him
laughing in there.

04:35.484 --> 04:38.100
Almost forgot
what that sounded like.

04:41.574 --> 04:44.190
I can't be his father
and his best friend.

04:45.870 --> 04:47.451
He needs you.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.362
I know that's a lot
to throw at you.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.281
So if you're ever feeling
like you need a break...

04:52.460 --> 04:54.621
I'm done taking breaks.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.631
So what's the plan?

05:03.846 --> 05:05.837
This place,

05:06.015 --> 05:08.051
is it home

05:08.225 --> 05:10.341
orjust a stop
along the way?

05:13.856 --> 05:16.017
Well, let's--

05:16.192 --> 05:19.776
let's just stay here
while we figure it out.

05:28.287 --> 05:29.743
Well, we'll need
more supplies.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.279
I'll go with Carl
and get some.

05:31.457 --> 05:33.539
I'll come, too.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.665
You were unconscious
yesterday.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.999
- I'm awake today.
- We need you strong.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.711
Just rest.

05:43.886 --> 05:45.877
Just one more day.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.941
How long you think
you1lbe?

06:05.115 --> 06:08.198
Fill a couple bags,
shouldn't be too long.

06:09.453 --> 06:11.364
It's 8:15 now.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.370
We'll be back
by noon.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.532
All right,
you follow her lead.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.870
You understand?

06:21.131 --> 06:22.667
Hey.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.877
Everything okay?

06:26.220 --> 06:28.085
Yeah, I'm just...

06:28.264 --> 06:30.129
hungry.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.056
All right.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.218
I'll see you
in a couple hours.

07:10.264 --> 07:12.596
(grunts)

07:34.496 --> 07:37.033
(ticking )

08:00.981 --> 08:02.482
Find anything good?

08:02.650 --> 08:05.312
Candy bars?

08:06.945 --> 08:08.936
Comic books?

08:12.159 --> 08:14.150
Crazy Cheese?

08:14.328 --> 08:15.818
Huh?

08:15.996 --> 08:19.409
Bam, Crazy Cheese.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.539
Found it still sealed
and everything.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.666
Now I'll be nice
and let you have the first pull.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.702
No, thanks.

08:25.881 --> 08:27.792
Are you sure?

08:27.966 --> 08:30.002
I'm fine.

08:32.471 --> 08:34.211
You don't seem fine.

08:38.435 --> 08:40.426
I'm just tired.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.469
Okay?

08:52.700 --> 08:55.692
(squirting)

08:58.789 --> 09:01.371
( hisses )

09:14.680 --> 09:17.137
I'm sorry.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.470
I'm not very good
at making boys your age laugh.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.561
- ( knocks)
- l was laughing.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.602
lnside.

09:27.776 --> 09:30.233
( knocks )

09:30.404 --> 09:32.816
Toddlers
find me funny.

09:32.990 --> 09:35.447
Two, three-year-olds.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.573
( knocking )

09:37.745 --> 09:41.237
What do you mean
toddlers?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.662
I had
a three-year-old son

09:45.836 --> 09:48.452
and he happened to find me
extremely funny.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.375
( door opens)

10:11.278 --> 10:15.271
We need food, batteries, water,
in that order.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.610
Why didn't you ever
tell me you had a kid?

10:19.787 --> 10:21.448
What was his name?

10:22.831 --> 10:25.072
Did you have
any others?

10:25.250 --> 10:26.911
Were you married?

10:28.337 --> 10:30.999
Okay.

10:31.173 --> 10:35.416
I'll answer
one question at a time,

10:35.594 --> 10:38.085
one room at a time,

10:38.263 --> 10:40.254
and only after
we've cleared it.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.060
- ( man grunts)
- Man #2: You're a coward.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.476
- Man: No, I'm sorry.
- Man #2: You're a lying coward.

10:53.654 --> 10:56.316
- That's all you'll ever be.
- Man: No, please, I'm sorry.

10:56.490 --> 10:59.072
- Don't do this, please.
- Man #2: What the hell'd you say to me?

10:59.243 --> 11:02.326
- Man: I said don't do this.
- Man #2: This ain't your business.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.236
- Man: I'm sorry, man.
- Man #2: Aw, shut up.

11:04.414 --> 11:07.121
- Man: I'm so sorry. No, don't.
- Man #2: It's gonna happen.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.577
Man: We can work this out.
Please, don't do this.

11:08.752 --> 11:09.958
Man #2: It's gonna happen.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.868
Man: No, no, no, please.
Please don't. Please!

11:12.047 --> 11:13.833
- ( blow lands)
- ( man screams )

11:14.007 --> 11:16.999
(men laughing)

11:21.682 --> 11:23.343
( man screaming )
Oh, God!

11:23.517 --> 11:25.678
Man #3: You plan on
finishing the job?

11:25.853 --> 11:27.844
- Man #2: Yeah.
- Man #4: I'm getting an earache

11:28.021 --> 11:29.886
and I know he'sjust gonna
let his ass squeal.

11:30.065 --> 11:32.397
Man #2: After what he did,
the man deserves to bleed.

11:32.568 --> 11:33.774
( footsteps approaching )

11:33.944 --> 11:36.310
Man #4: Y'all stay down
there if you want.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.900
( footsteps approaching )

11:43.954 --> 11:47.242
( indistinct chatter)

12:01.930 --> 12:04.091
( door opens)

12:08.145 --> 12:11.683
- ( footsteps approach )
- ( chattering continues )

12:46.266 --> 12:48.928
(watch ticking )

12:57.736 --> 12:58.942
(ticking stops)

12:59.112 --> 13:01.398
( floorboards creak )

13:06.203 --> 13:09.912
(banging)

13:19.925 --> 13:22.132
-( bed squeaks )
- ( man sighs )

13:23.971 --> 13:27.304
Man: This will be our
abode for the evening.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.886
Clean up your mess,
Harley.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.813
What was your son's name?

13:43.991 --> 13:46.653
I said after.

13:46.827 --> 13:50.615
Well, these are actually
two separate rooms

13:50.789 --> 13:53.531
and we already cleared
that one, so...

13:57.879 --> 13:59.835
Andre.

14:01.883 --> 14:04.260
His name was
Andre Anthony.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.882
Make sure there isn't
box of cookies hiding in there.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.553
Did you have
any other kids?

14:16.732 --> 14:19.189
Rules of the game,
my friend.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.693
So?

14:26.867 --> 14:28.357
Did you?

14:28.535 --> 14:31.948
( scoffs )
You know, you could be a spy.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.987
Or a cop.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.586
(sighs)

14:38.754 --> 14:40.460
No.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.337
One was enough for me.

14:43.508 --> 14:46.045
And Andre was a handful,
like you.

14:48.430 --> 14:50.421
Does this hallway
count as a room?

14:50.599 --> 14:53.090
If you can find
something we can use.

15:11.828 --> 15:14.570
This is the only thing
I could find.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.579
Does it count?

15:16.750 --> 15:18.911
Technically, yes.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.506
So?

15:26.802 --> 15:28.838
How long has it been?

15:32.182 --> 15:35.424
It happened after--

15:36.478 --> 15:38.844
you know, after
everything happened.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.599
Does my dad know?

15:43.777 --> 15:45.938
Never told him.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.484
Never told anyone

15:50.659 --> 15:53.446
till just now.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.284
Your secret
is safe with me.

16:04.589 --> 16:07.171
It's not really a secret.

16:09.553 --> 16:11.635
It's still safe with me.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.357
(sighs)

19:01.099 --> 19:03.465
( breathing heavily )

19:11.276 --> 19:12.732
Michonne?

19:17.073 --> 19:18.984
Everything okay?

19:19.159 --> 19:21.150
Yeah, it's fine.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.703
There's a baby in there.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.675
My dad let me name her.

19:53.485 --> 19:55.521
Maybe--

19:57.238 --> 20:01.527
maybe her and Andre
are together somewhere.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.577
Come on.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.712
It's almost noon.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.216
Your dad will wonder
where we are if we're late.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.050
(man snoring )

20:30.939 --> 20:34.306
- ( indistinct chatter)
- ( footsteps approaching )

20:38.738 --> 20:41.775
- ( snoring continues)
- Yo.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.906
( knocking )

20:44.077 --> 20:46.693
Comfy?

20:46.871 --> 20:50.238
You waking me up
to see if I'm comfortable?

20:50.417 --> 20:51.702
I want to lie down.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.912
Two other bedrooms
up here to choose.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.920
Them's kids' beds.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.206
I want this one.

20:59.384 --> 21:02.421
- lt's claimed.
- I didn't hear it.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.086
You gonna have to lay
claim somewhere else.

21:07.559 --> 21:10.551
( both grunting )

21:10.728 --> 21:13.515
( punches landing )

21:13.690 --> 21:16.181
( groans )

21:23.825 --> 21:26.612
( groans, coughs)

21:26.786 --> 21:29.493
Len!
Len, stop!

21:34.294 --> 21:36.159
Stop, Len!

21:36.337 --> 21:38.168
- Stop!
- Hell, no.

21:38.339 --> 21:39.920
Stop!

21:41.801 --> 21:43.792
( Len panting )

21:53.021 --> 21:56.104
My bed now, jackoff.

21:56.274 --> 21:58.390
( bed creaks )

22:03.114 --> 22:04.820
( groans )

22:05.825 --> 22:08.066
(sighs)

22:44.864 --> 22:47.321
Hey, don't move.

22:47.492 --> 22:49.528
Here's some water.

22:51.621 --> 22:53.577
Where are we?

22:53.748 --> 22:55.113
I don't know.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.373
We were fighting biters
and you passed out

22:57.544 --> 22:59.751
right after we left the prison.
I didn't know what to do.

22:59.921 --> 23:02.412
The back of the truck seemed safer
than the side of the road.

23:02.590 --> 23:05.172
Hey, hey.
Hey.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.589
Did we pass a bus?

23:08.763 --> 23:11.345
On the road,
did we pass a bus?

23:11.516 --> 23:13.723
Yeah.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.804
What did you see?

23:19.107 --> 23:21.769
What did you see?

23:23.111 --> 23:24.726
They were all dead.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.315
How long since
we passed it?

23:30.493 --> 23:32.905
Three hours.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.080
- Hey.
- ( tapping )

23:38.251 --> 23:40.458
Hey, stop the truck.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.997
Hey, numbnuts,
stop the truck.

23:47.510 --> 23:49.717
Stop the truck!

23:51.598 --> 23:53.304
Stop the truck!

24:11.159 --> 24:12.695
Where the hell
are you going?

24:12.869 --> 24:14.609
Where the hell
is he going?

24:14.787 --> 24:16.618
I don't know what your
lady friend's told you

24:16.789 --> 24:18.245
about the special nature
of the mission we're on,

24:18.416 --> 24:19.747
but this shit
is time-sensitive

24:19.917 --> 24:21.498
and we're already
way behind schedule.

24:21.669 --> 24:24.331
So I need you to turn your ass around
and get back in the truck.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.876
- I gotta go.
- It seems like neither one of you's

24:28.051 --> 24:29.166
been paying
close enough attention

24:29.344 --> 24:31.209
to the hell on
earth we've been living in.

24:31.387 --> 24:32.376
So let me tell you how
to best avoid

24:32.555 --> 24:34.466
winding up just another
dead-alive prick.

24:36.059 --> 24:38.266
You find some strong,
like-minded comrades

24:38.436 --> 24:41.018
and you stay stuck together
like wet on water.

24:41.189 --> 24:43.646
We need people.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.683
The more the better.
We need each other, partner.

24:46.861 --> 24:49.193
Even with all that gear on your
shoulder, you won't last a night.

24:49.364 --> 24:51.446
Not by yourself.

24:51.616 --> 24:53.652
I'll take my chances.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.782
I'm gonna have to insist

24:55.953 --> 24:58.160
that you hold the hell up.

24:58.331 --> 24:59.946
All right,
believe it or not,

25:00.124 --> 25:02.376
the fate of the entire
damn human race

25:02.543 --> 25:04.875
might depend on it.

25:08.174 --> 25:10.335
What the hell
are you talking about?

25:11.511 --> 25:13.593
Who is this guy?

25:13.763 --> 25:15.219
l'm Sergeant Abraham Ford.

25:15.390 --> 25:17.802
And these are my companions
Rosita Espinosa

25:17.975 --> 25:20.057
and Dr. Eugene Porter.

25:20.228 --> 25:23.186
We're on a mission to get
Eugene to Washington, DC.

25:23.356 --> 25:25.847
Eugene's a scientist

25:26.025 --> 25:29.017
and he knows exactly
what caused this mess.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.371
All right.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.533
So what happened?

25:45.878 --> 25:47.379
lt's classified.

25:49.632 --> 25:51.168
He'd been talking
to the muckety-mucks in Washington

25:51.342 --> 25:53.458
on his satellite phone.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.718
The past couple weeks,

25:55.888 --> 25:58.300
nobody's been picking up
on the other end.

25:58.474 --> 26:01.216
We saw how you handled
those corpses back there.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.765
We could use your help.

26:12.405 --> 26:14.612
Sorry.

26:21.456 --> 26:23.572
I had to get us
off that road.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.957
You were passed out,
we were out of bullets.

26:26.127 --> 26:28.368
I know how to get
back to that bus.

26:28.546 --> 26:30.958
I wrote down
every turn.

26:31.132 --> 26:34.841
I will get you back
if I can, okay?

26:35.011 --> 26:36.797
That's where
she'd go to find me.

26:36.971 --> 26:39.428
- That's where I'm gonna go.
- It's a waste of time.

26:39.599 --> 26:42.181
Tara told us
what went down.

26:42.351 --> 26:45.093
There is zero chance
you will ever find your wife again.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.102
Alive or dead.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.514
Mainly because,
sorry to tell you,

26:49.692 --> 26:51.648
she's gone.

26:54.989 --> 26:57.071
No need for you
to die, too.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.491
Now, come on.

27:00.661 --> 27:03.073
Get back in the truck.
Do something with your life.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.793
( pack drops)

27:12.590 --> 27:16.583
When the people
we love kick...

27:20.181 --> 27:22.263
well, they disappear.

27:25.102 --> 27:27.514
Doesn't mean you've got
to go out that way, too.

27:33.569 --> 27:35.025
(grunts)

27:37.657 --> 27:40.945
She's alive
and I'm gonna find her.

27:41.118 --> 27:43.154
You son of a bitch!

27:43.329 --> 27:44.535
- ( shouts)
- ( grunts)

27:44.705 --> 27:46.832
- Tara: Hey, hey, hey!
- Rosita: Abraham!

27:46.999 --> 27:48.830
Hey, get off him.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.912
Come on.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.169
You don't want this,
Abraham.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.002
Glenn:
Let me go!

27:58.678 --> 28:00.634
- Rosita: Abraham!
- Tara: Stop!

28:00.805 --> 28:03.512
(snarling )

28:04.517 --> 28:07.509
Hey. Hey!

28:07.687 --> 28:09.678
- Hey!
- Rosita: Abraham!

28:12.984 --> 28:15.691
- Hey, get--
- ( Glenn shouts)

28:18.614 --> 28:20.866
- ( snarling )
- ( fighting continues)

28:23.286 --> 28:24.526
Hey, hey, hey!
Come here!

28:24.704 --> 28:27.411
(growling)

28:38.885 --> 28:41.046
Tara: Stop!

28:41.220 --> 28:43.836
(gunfire)

28:47.435 --> 28:50.222
Eugene!
Stop firing, damn it!

28:50.396 --> 28:52.887
Stop firing!
We need to get our weapons.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.522
(gunfire continues)

28:55.693 --> 28:56.899
Rosita:
Leave 'em!

28:57.069 --> 28:59.151
Glenn:
Hey, give me a gun.

28:59.322 --> 29:01.233
Give me a gun.

29:17.173 --> 29:19.789
(gas spilling)

29:31.479 --> 29:33.765
Son of a dick.

29:35.274 --> 29:38.732
-( ball bouncing)
- ( man snoring )

29:46.410 --> 29:49.402
( men chatting )

29:57.004 --> 29:58.995
( gasps )

30:41.841 --> 30:44.878
Man: Tony, Len, get your
asses down here.

30:48.472 --> 30:51.009
(ball bouncing)

30:51.183 --> 30:52.923
Yo, you hear me?

31:06.824 --> 31:10.533
( clattering )

31:48.574 --> 31:49.984
Man:
Claim, claim, claim!

31:50.159 --> 31:53.401
Len: Shut the hell up.
I'm trying to sleep.

31:53.579 --> 31:55.240
Man #2: There's a woman
shacking up in here.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.746
- Len: Say what?
- Man #3: Come on down.

31:57.917 --> 31:59.407
Len: She hot?

31:59.585 --> 32:00.825
Man #4: Don't grab
your peckerjust yet.

32:01.003 --> 32:02.709
She ain't here.

32:05.174 --> 32:06.755
Len: What the hell
you hollering about?

32:06.926 --> 32:08.416
Man #2:
Found her shirt.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.960
Must have washed it
this morning.

32:11.138 --> 32:13.424
- Man #3: Smells good.
- Oh, you found a shirt?

32:13.599 --> 32:15.385
She could be miles
away by now.

32:15.559 --> 32:17.595
Man #2: Why'd she go
to all the trouble of washing a shirt

32:17.770 --> 32:19.431
if she's just
gonna ditch it?

32:19.605 --> 32:21.516
- She'll be back.
- Len: I call first when she gets here.

32:21.690 --> 32:23.396
Man #5: Who knows who else
she got with her.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.148
We need to be ready
for anything.

32:25.319 --> 32:28.277
- Len, take the side room.
- Hold on, let me get a gun.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.280
I'll watch the front den,
you've got the other side room.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.283
- I thought Tony got that.
- Where the hell is Tony?

32:34.453 --> 32:36.694
Tony!

32:36.872 --> 32:38.578
Get him the hell up.

32:38.749 --> 32:40.740
(grunts)

33:05.067 --> 33:07.399
( choking )

33:12.575 --> 33:15.066
( panting )

33:34.054 --> 33:36.045
( men chatting )

35:31.255 --> 35:34.088
( door opens)

35:38.721 --> 35:42.305
(ball bouncing)

35:46.937 --> 35:49.770
Abraham: We were running
a convoy in one of these.

35:49.940 --> 35:51.680
Coming up a dune,
there's this camel,

35:51.859 --> 35:53.520
looks like
it's about to puke.

35:53.694 --> 35:56.310
Probably because
shitbird's packed

35:56.488 --> 35:59.150
about four pounds
of C-4 up its ass.

35:59.325 --> 36:01.111
We were within 20 feet
of that blast

36:01.285 --> 36:04.152
that sent that animal's hump
half a klick into the desert.

36:04.330 --> 36:07.163
And we drove home.

36:07.333 --> 36:10.621
So you tell me
how in the holy hell

36:10.794 --> 36:13.171
did you possibly
kill this truck?

36:15.007 --> 36:16.338
A fully amped-up state

36:16.508 --> 36:18.999
and an ignorance
of rapid-firing weapons.

36:23.557 --> 36:25.593
Is this yours?

36:34.109 --> 36:36.691
Sorry about your ride.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.194
Hope you guys
make it to Washington.

36:48.457 --> 36:50.448
Wait for me.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.536
(sighs)

36:57.049 --> 36:59.335
What the hell else
are we gonna do?

36:59.510 --> 37:01.466
Go to Washington.

37:03.138 --> 37:05.720
Fix the whole
damn world!

37:08.644 --> 37:11.431
That way's clear.
Who knows what's north.

37:11.605 --> 37:14.438
We'll find another vehicle.
We'll go with them until we do.

37:15.818 --> 37:18.400
Trust me.
I'm smarter than you.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.228
(ball bouncing)

38:21.383 --> 38:24.216
(spits)

38:33.437 --> 38:35.553
( whistles )

38:42.905 --> 38:44.736
Come on.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.170
- ( walker snarls )
- ( man screaming )

39:06.345 --> 39:09.212
- Man #2: Stop her!
- Son of bitch.

39:09.389 --> 39:11.596
- Man #3: Kill her! Kill her!
- ( gunshots)

39:11.767 --> 39:14.634
( men shouting )

39:16.146 --> 39:17.761
Go! Go!

39:17.940 --> 39:20.852
(shouting and gunfire
conﬁnue)

39:33.497 --> 39:35.704
Abraham:
Got to hand it to him.

39:35.874 --> 39:38.536
He's a persistent
son of a bitch.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.710
| get why you're
following him.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.667
You're loyal.

39:44.841 --> 39:47.048
You're a good person.

39:47.219 --> 39:49.210
I like it.

39:50.430 --> 39:51.966
But what we're doing--

39:54.768 --> 39:57.555
I don't know
how else to say it--

39:57.729 --> 40:00.892
saving the world
is just--

40:01.066 --> 40:03.648
( chuckles )
is just more important.

40:06.947 --> 40:09.734
I mean, even if he does
find his wife,

40:09.908 --> 40:12.320
so what?

40:12.494 --> 40:14.906
How long do you think
they'll live happily ever after

40:15.080 --> 40:17.412
if we don't get Eugene
up to Washington?

40:17.583 --> 40:19.164
You think because
I'm following Glenn,

40:19.334 --> 40:20.915
that makes me a good person?

40:21.086 --> 40:22.826
I'm not.

40:23.005 --> 40:25.166
( laughs)

40:25.340 --> 40:27.171
You're good.

40:27.342 --> 40:29.674
You don't know
anything about me.

40:29.845 --> 40:32.461
Just like I don't know anything
about why you're going to Washington.

40:32.639 --> 40:35.176
| get why
Eugene's going.

40:35.350 --> 40:36.601
He's the only one that
knows how to end this.

40:36.768 --> 40:40.727
And Rosita, she loves you.
She'd follow you anywhere.

40:40.897 --> 40:43.809
But why the hell you agreed to drive him
halfway across the country...

40:43.984 --> 40:46.441
It's that hard to believe,
I want to save the world?

40:46.612 --> 40:48.603
Because you're
a good person?

40:50.657 --> 40:52.522
You don't have
to tell me why.

40:52.701 --> 40:54.737
Just don't lie to me.

41:12.304 --> 41:14.511
Crazy Cheese?

41:38.830 --> 41:40.946
What do you think?

41:45.420 --> 41:47.502
Let's go.

41:51.635 --> 41:53.500
Let's go.

42:19.079 --> 42:21.616
(theme music playing )
