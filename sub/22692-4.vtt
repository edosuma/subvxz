WEBVTT

01:02.440 --> 01:04.440
Thank you!

01:04.480 --> 01:06.240
Hello! Hello!

01:09.360 --> 01:11.360
-Thank you.
-Hello!

01:11.400 --> 01:14.040
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

01:14.080 --> 01:16.800
Thanks, everybody,
and welcome!

01:16.840 --> 01:19.200
And in today's show...

01:19.240 --> 01:22.120
Richard chooses
his favourite waterfall.

01:22.160 --> 01:25.000
I like that big one.

01:25.040 --> 01:28.960
...James waters
a stranger's barbecue...

01:29.000 --> 01:31.800
...and I put
some dust on a girl.

01:35.920 --> 01:39.680
All that is to come,
but we start with McLaren.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.880
They have replaced the 650
with a new car

01:41.920 --> 01:46.160
which is fast around
the corners and faster
in a straight line.

01:46.200 --> 01:50.680
Plainly, then, the only one
of us three qualified
to drive such a thing

01:50.720 --> 01:54.480
is Richard "Whoops,
I've Done It Again" Hammond.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.480
RICHARD:
While the outgoing car
may have been great to drive,

02:04.520 --> 02:09.200
it was never what you'd call
beautiful, or even
very exciting to look at,

02:09.240 --> 02:12.920
but its replacement, well
that's a different matter.

02:15.600 --> 02:19.040
It's called the 720S,
and from any angle

02:19.080 --> 02:22.640
and in every detail,
it's simply sensational.

02:26.320 --> 02:31.160
Right down to the engine bay
that glows red when you
unlock the doors.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.600
Yup, on the head-turn-o-meter

02:37.640 --> 02:41.280
this thing definitely matches
the Ferrari 488

02:41.320 --> 02:43.240
and the Lamborghini Huracán.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.800
And then when we move onto
the business of speed
and power,

02:46.840 --> 02:48.760
it actually beats them.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.720
Nought to 60
takes just 2.8 seconds.

03:01.680 --> 03:05.080
Top speed
is 212 miles an hour.

03:07.080 --> 03:11.080
Both those numbers walloping
the efforts of the Italians.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.840
Everything is bigger
in this car.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.600
Even the price, £208,000.

03:16.640 --> 03:21.800
Oh, wait, that's not a good
point, is it? No, that's a...
Never mind. Whatever.

03:21.840 --> 03:25.320
The horsepower is...
Well, it's ridiculous
is what it is.

03:25.360 --> 03:32.000
This four-litre V8
with its twin-turbos
produces 710 of them.

03:32.040 --> 03:35.640
To put that into context,
the actual mechanical engine
in a McLaren P1

03:35.680 --> 03:38.080
without all the hybrid
battery boost

03:38.120 --> 03:40.360
produces
just 17 horsepower more.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.680
The net result of that is...

03:47.000 --> 03:48.760
...staggering!

03:52.480 --> 03:54.240
Ooh, that is fast.

03:58.440 --> 04:02.680
However, although they've
gone nuts with the styling
and the engine,

04:02.720 --> 04:05.960
the 720
is still very much a McLaren.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.400
By that,
I mean it's been made

04:09.440 --> 04:11.600
by the ultimate tech nerds
from the Kingdom of Geeks.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.080
Let me put it this way.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.120
This is, like I say,
the replacement

04:17.160 --> 04:19.160
for the McLaren 650S.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.880
If you ask a McLaren
technician, so how much
of this car is new then,

04:21.920 --> 04:25.160
they will tell you 91%.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.200
Not, "nearly all of it,
mate,"

04:27.240 --> 04:29.240
or "about 90%".

04:29.280 --> 04:30.920
91%.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.760
James May applied for a job
at McLaren

04:34.800 --> 04:36.880
but they turned him down
for being too slapdash.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.280
And this incredible geekery
has paid dividends.

04:44.760 --> 04:48.600
For example, one of
the reasons the 720
looks so pretty

04:48.640 --> 04:51.200
is because it's the only
mid-engine super car

04:51.240 --> 04:55.480
without massive gaping
intakes behind the doors.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.760
Instead, McLaren created
subtle channels

04:58.800 --> 05:04.400
along the bodywork to feed
air into the engine bay.

05:04.440 --> 05:09.960
More nerd stuff. The old car,
the 650, had a carbon fibre
tub that came up to here.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.440
On the 720, all of this,
all of that down the centre,
everything, is carbon fibre.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.640
That means these
carbon windscreen pillars
can be very thin,

05:18.680 --> 05:21.760
which makes it easier
to see out, and it's light.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.120
Overall, they've lost
about 18 kilograms up here.

05:24.160 --> 05:27.440
That means the centre
of gravity is lower,
which is good.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.120
Then there's the
computer-controlled
suspension,

05:33.160 --> 05:38.040
which is even more advanced
than the system on the P1.

05:38.080 --> 05:42.360
It makes the ride on this
700-horsepower hardcore
supercar

05:42.400 --> 05:46.480
as comfortable
as a nice sit down.

05:46.520 --> 05:50.760
The question is, what does
all that comfortableness mean
for the handling?

05:53.320 --> 05:57.080
Here we go. Track mode...
active.

05:58.680 --> 06:02.920
Haw! I like that.
I do like that.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.480
Right! Um, well, carry on!

06:13.360 --> 06:14.760
Oh, my God!

06:18.440 --> 06:21.080
This is breath-taking!

06:21.120 --> 06:23.320
The new chassis control
system on this,

06:23.360 --> 06:28.000
based on the work of proper
pointy-heads in Cambridge,

06:28.040 --> 06:31.480
it's all about maintaining
the biggest possible
contact patch

06:31.520 --> 06:33.440
between the tyres
and the tarmac.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.320
God! It's the grip!
It's staggering!

06:39.080 --> 06:40.560
It feels like
a four-wheel drive.

06:46.400 --> 06:49.560
But if you do want things
to get a little more lairy,

06:49.600 --> 06:53.120
simply dive into the
computers and activate

06:53.160 --> 06:57.320
Variable Drift Control. It
lets you select the angle of
dangle through your drift

06:57.360 --> 06:59.480
by varying the amount
of traction control.

06:59.520 --> 07:03.720
I think we'll go for all of
it, lots of drift available.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.640
Yeah, maybe less than that,
I think.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.760
I think I'm gonna have 38%.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.000
38.5.
This is a McLaren. Accuracy.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.960
And that seemed
to do the trick.

07:27.800 --> 07:28.960
Yes!

07:30.320 --> 07:33.200
Yes! Working! That's it!

07:35.240 --> 07:38.360
I know my setting
on a McLaren's
Variable Drift Control.

07:42.160 --> 07:43.920
Unleash the beast!

07:47.640 --> 07:49.680
And when you've finished
your slide fest...

07:53.360 --> 07:55.960
...you can switch back
to comfort mode,

07:56.000 --> 08:00.640
and settle down
for a relaxing cruise.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.080
That's the thing that
stands out about this car,

08:03.120 --> 08:06.560
it's everything in one. You
want speed, you get speed.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.280
You want comfort,
you get comfort.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.760
You wanna lose tyre rubber,
help yourself.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.640
You want boot space,
there's plenty.

08:13.680 --> 08:17.120
But the thing I keep coming
back to is those looks.

08:17.160 --> 08:20.680
Because at last, McLaren's
technical perfection

08:20.720 --> 08:23.320
has been clothed in a way
that does justice

08:23.360 --> 08:25.200
to the fizzing brilliance
underneath.

08:27.920 --> 08:32.320
God, I'm falling in love
a bit here.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.000
Actually, no,
I'll go further, I'm in love.
This is utterly brilliant.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.840
No, you're wrong.
Well, no, I drove that car,

08:51.880 --> 08:56.640
not that one, but I drove a
720 a couple of weeks ago
and I didn't love it.

08:56.680 --> 08:59.200
Are you just being obtuse
because I did?

08:59.240 --> 09:01.360
No, no, honestly. I didn't
like the brake pedal.

09:04.560 --> 09:07.160
-No.
Was it the handbrake?

09:07.200 --> 09:09.280
-No.
-Was it round
and in front of you?

09:09.320 --> 09:13.280
No! Listen! The problem was -
imagine a volume knob
on a stereo

09:13.320 --> 09:17.040
where the volume doesn't
start till you get to six.

09:17.080 --> 09:19.040
So you push
and then it all happens.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.040
You wouldn't have
noticed it on the track,

09:21.080 --> 09:23.360
but on the road it was almost
impossible to drive smoothly.

09:23.400 --> 09:26.240
It drove me mad. Nearly
as mad as the seat controls.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.120
What was wrong with those,
then?

09:28.160 --> 09:29.960
They were really complicated.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.640
I should explain, by the way,
that this is a man

09:32.680 --> 09:35.880
who a couple of days ago
summoned a woman from
the other side of London

09:35.920 --> 09:37.720
to help him send a tweet.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.760
-Yeah, he did!
-No.

09:39.800 --> 09:42.120
-It was a complicated tweet.
-No, it wasn't complicated.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.960
-Did you try
the seat control?
-Can I say, actually, yes.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.600
And I agree with you,
there's no sense to it.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.880
There's no sense to all this.
You can't recline.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.880
You can't make them
do what you want.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.760
Anyway, let's forget the seat
controls and let's forget
the brake pedal

09:53.800 --> 09:58.640
and let's find out how fast
the 720 goes round
the Eboladrome.

09:58.680 --> 10:01.040
-With someone
who can adjust the seat.
-Yes.

10:02.280 --> 10:04.400
Right, let's do this.

10:04.440 --> 10:09.680
JEREMY: And she's off.
Short-shifting away from the
line to manage the traction

10:09.720 --> 10:11.760
and immediately
onto the Isn't.

10:11.800 --> 10:15.120
Total focus there.

10:15.160 --> 10:18.840
A deliberately wide line
round the first corner,

10:18.880 --> 10:23.480
working the tyres hard
on this cold, tricky track.

10:23.520 --> 10:25.640
Flying down
to Your Name Here.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.360
-God, that thing
sounds good.

10:28.400 --> 10:32.040
-Ooh, getting
a bit of tyre squeal there.

10:32.080 --> 10:35.200
And then hammer down up the
hill and back onto the Isn't.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.800
This is so quick.

10:39.840 --> 10:44.160
A dab of brakes. Down the box
to keep the fire lit.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.520
Now up to the slow and
technical Old Lady's House.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.200
Avoiding any understeer
there.

10:49.240 --> 10:53.440
Interesting, she's got the
car in track mode but the
dash is in full screen.

10:53.480 --> 10:57.640
Clearly that's what
proper drivers prefer.

10:57.680 --> 11:01.360
Even with the air brake up,
clearly needs some managing
under braking.

11:01.400 --> 11:04.120
Just the last corner
to go now.

11:04.160 --> 11:07.440
Slices through there
and across the line!

11:10.400 --> 11:13.040
It looked good.
It looks fast.

11:13.080 --> 11:16.480
Right, let's see where it
goes on the leader board.

11:16.520 --> 11:19.800
Here we go, up it goes.
Quicker than the GTR.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.040
Ooh! Now, that's
quite interesting, isn't it,

11:23.080 --> 11:26.920
because what we've
deduced from that
is the car you loved

11:26.960 --> 11:31.040
is no faster
than the car it has replaced.

11:31.080 --> 11:34.240
Yeah, yeah. That is a bit
weird. The only thing
I can think of

11:34.280 --> 11:37.400
is the 650 was on Super
Trofeo tyres which are
super sticky, wasn't it?

11:37.440 --> 11:41.160
And that 720 was
on normal road tyres.
It makes a difference.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.000
-That is actually
quite a good explanation.
-Thank you.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.440
Well it's either that
or it's no better.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.840
Anyway, shut up,
because now it's time for us

11:49.880 --> 11:54.160
to plant a sapling of chat
on Conversation Street.

12:01.680 --> 12:05.040
And it is an unusual
Conversation Street
this week.

12:05.080 --> 12:09.400
Because it's the end of the
year we're doing our awards,
OK,

12:09.440 --> 12:11.200
or as we call them,
the Nigels.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.440
We start actually with, well,
we're calling it

12:15.480 --> 12:20.920
the Nissan Juke Award for
the Worst Car of the Year.

12:20.960 --> 12:24.840
Nominations are, the
Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.880
Why is that on the list?

12:26.920 --> 12:29.320
Well, many, many reasons,
actually, chief among which

12:29.360 --> 12:32.040
is the way it beeps as you're
driving along for no reason.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.720
You just go along
and it goes "beep".

12:33.760 --> 12:36.440
-Ah.
-Nothing's happened,
it's just beeping.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.840
-Maybe it's just bored.
-I'd be bored if I was
a PHEV, but anyway.

12:39.880 --> 12:43.360
Other nominations include
the Mini Countryman

12:43.400 --> 12:45.160
and the Renault Kadjar.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.600
And the winner is...

12:50.600 --> 12:52.360
It's the Nissan Juke!

12:52.400 --> 12:54.160
There you go!

12:56.600 --> 12:59.720
-A deserved award.
-Oh, yeah, it is.

12:59.760 --> 13:05.720
The judges were
particularly impressed with
its consistent awfulness.

13:05.760 --> 13:09.240
It was awful when it was
first launched seven years
ago

13:09.280 --> 13:12.440
and it continues to be awful
to this day. Well done,
the Nissan Juke.

13:12.480 --> 13:15.440
Do you know what that car is?
It's a wacky vicar.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.880
It's more like the sort
of vicar that will go,

13:17.920 --> 13:22.400
"I've just been on My Face,
and do you know who else was
there? Jesus!"

13:22.440 --> 13:24.320
-Yeah.
-That's what it is.

13:24.360 --> 13:28.240
Next it is
the Hard Ass To Follow Nigel.

13:28.280 --> 13:32.400
This is given to the car with
the worst-looking rear end.

13:32.440 --> 13:36.320
The nominations are
the Honda Civic Type R.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.360
-Oh, I like that.
-No, you're wrong.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.520
That is well wrong. It's just
a car they wouldn't stop
designing.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.200
Look how many spoilers
they put there.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.560
"We'll have one here and one
here and one there and there,

13:45.600 --> 13:47.560
and we'll have the one
exhaust, two exhausts,
three..."

13:47.600 --> 13:50.800
It's a bit like your jacket.
They just didn't know
when to stop adding bits,

13:50.840 --> 13:54.600
unnecessary, pointless,
stupid things to it.

13:54.640 --> 13:56.440
I might be in with a shout.

13:56.480 --> 13:59.760
The next nomination
is the Toyota C-HR.

13:59.800 --> 14:05.000
A car styled by nine people
who'd fallen out
at a wedding.

14:05.040 --> 14:09.440
But the winner of the Hard
Ass To Follow Nigel is...

14:09.480 --> 14:12.640
Ooh! It's
the Land Rover Discovery!

14:12.680 --> 14:14.680
Look at that!

14:16.760 --> 14:18.720
I think the problem is the
designer Gerry McGovern...

14:18.760 --> 14:20.520
Can we get
a picture of him here?

14:22.840 --> 14:25.520
And this is his dog.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.720
-This is where he lives.
-It all makes sense.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.760
So it's only natural his car
should look like that.

14:31.800 --> 14:35.600
It's just all hunched up.
Now we have a special award.

14:35.640 --> 14:39.760
It goes to a car that
you like but you know
you shouldn't

14:39.800 --> 14:42.080
cos it would be
a bit embarrassing.

14:42.120 --> 14:45.920
We're calling it the "You
Would But You Know
You Shouldn't" Award.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.760
Sarah Palin.

14:50.360 --> 14:51.640
Oh, yeah!

14:51.680 --> 14:56.760
It is the new - next year's
one, actually - Corvette ZR1.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.560
RICHARD: That is...

15:01.840 --> 15:04.280
That fits the bill perfectly.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.400
That is exactly right,
because you would buy one
cos, "Wow!"

15:07.440 --> 15:11.800
And then the next morning
you'd wake up and think,
"What have I done?"

15:11.840 --> 15:14.680
We're moving on now to the
Lack of Continuity Award.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.720
Nobody's gonna beat me
on that.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.960
You were nominated for
your mid-season haircut,
that's true,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.360
but you were
beaten by Richard Hammond!

15:21.400 --> 15:23.520
Hold on.
Why was he beaten by me?

15:23.560 --> 15:25.560
Well...

15:25.600 --> 15:28.320
I would invite you all now to
pay careful attention to...

15:28.360 --> 15:33.640
well, actually a clip from
the McLaren film
that you saw earlier.

15:33.680 --> 15:37.200
This was an early edit, OK.
See if you can spot
something wrong here.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.800
On the head-turn-o-meter this
thing definitely matches

15:40.840 --> 15:44.040
the Ferrari 488 and the
Lamborghini Huracán.

15:44.080 --> 15:49.760
And then when we move onto
the subject of power and
speed it actually beats them.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.840
-A deserving winner.
-You switched to
a completely different car.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.000
Yeah.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.640
Which brings us
on to the next award...

16:00.680 --> 16:02.960
-Oh, no.
-Yes, you'll like this.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.320
It's for Accidentally Filling
Up the Petrol Tank of a
Supercar With Water Award.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.360
Oh, God.

16:11.400 --> 16:16.520
How in the name of all
that's holy did you do that?

16:16.560 --> 16:19.880
-Well, it's interesting...

16:19.920 --> 16:22.080
It was running low on fuel
at the track,

16:22.120 --> 16:25.200
and rather than take it off
to a petrol station which is
miles away,

16:25.240 --> 16:27.360
I filled it
from one of the jerry cans.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.200
-Yes.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.080
-No.

16:32.120 --> 16:35.400
-When the tea started tasting
funny, I suppose?

16:37.160 --> 16:38.720
It's, it's...

16:38.760 --> 16:41.560
It was when
the engine sort of let go.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.840
How many supercars have you
destroyed this year, Hammond?

16:44.880 --> 16:46.440
Two.

16:46.480 --> 16:49.000
Two?
How many have you driven?

16:49.040 --> 16:51.040
Two.

16:51.080 --> 16:57.320
Well, anyway, I'd like to
present you with your Nigel
for Appalling Continuity.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.360
-There you are.
-Thank you.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.360
-Richard Hammond.
-Thank you very much.

17:05.200 --> 17:09.520
That concludes the awards and
that concludes Conversation
Street for this week.

17:09.560 --> 17:14.160
Moving on. After every single
film we ever show
on The Grand Tour

17:14.200 --> 17:16.920
we always get a load of
messages from people
on social media...

17:16.960 --> 17:18.760
I say "people", I mean
teenagers,

17:18.800 --> 17:21.040
saying that
they didn't like the film

17:21.080 --> 17:24.600
cos it was too scripted,
too faked and too set-up.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.480
Yeah. I've got
one of them here.

17:26.520 --> 17:29.800
It's from Monaro Boy 4541

17:29.840 --> 17:33.320
who says, "I hated that thing
you did in Morocco

17:33.360 --> 17:37.680
because it was too scripted.
Why can't you do stuff like
you did in Portugal?

17:37.720 --> 17:41.120
Which I also hated
because it was too set-up."

17:41.160 --> 17:44.720
Yes, so we decided to make
a completely unplanned film.

17:44.760 --> 17:47.840
No scouts going ahead
to find locations,

17:47.880 --> 17:50.280
no pre-scripted exchanges
between us,

17:50.320 --> 17:52.680
no set-up explosions.

17:52.720 --> 17:57.280
No. All we agreed on was that
we should do whatever it was
we were going to do...

17:57.320 --> 17:59.080
in Croatia.

18:02.600 --> 18:06.240
We chose to meet
in the town of Zadar,

18:06.280 --> 18:08.680
next to its famous sea organ.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.960
Not realising that this
wave-powered machine

18:14.000 --> 18:17.320
makes
a terribly annoying noise.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.920
But I ploughed on regardless.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.960
This is an Audi TT RS.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.440
Four-wheel drive,
five-cylinder, turbo-charged,

18:28.480 --> 18:30.080
two-and-a-half-litre engine,

18:30.120 --> 18:32.520
nought to 60,
three and a half seconds.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.600
Really you can think of it
as a Nissan GTR

18:35.640 --> 18:38.200
in a Bauhaus baby-gro suit...

18:38.240 --> 18:40.480
No, that doesn't work,
hang on.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.560
Sorry, I normally think...

18:43.600 --> 18:46.440
I normally think of this
before I get here.
Hang on. It's a...

18:46.480 --> 18:49.200
It's a GTR...

18:49.240 --> 18:52.120
with a well-groomed
scrotum? No, that's...

18:54.880 --> 18:59.040
Before I'd had chance to come
up with the right words...

18:59.080 --> 19:03.000
...Richard Hammond arrived
in an Ariel Nomad.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.840
This is an Ariel Nomad.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.640
I know, I've already said
that in voice-over.

19:06.680 --> 19:09.480
Why didn't you bring
a Porsche?

19:09.520 --> 19:11.200
You could have brought
that Porsche...

19:11.240 --> 19:13.240
What is it

19:13.280 --> 19:15.960
No, the one that was
the Cockster that is now
the 97 one?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.440
-Yes, that.
Why didn't you bring that?

19:18.480 --> 19:20.480
Because I brought this.

19:20.520 --> 19:23.160
Nobody's gonna say,
"Shall I buy an Audi
or some scaffolding?"

19:23.200 --> 19:25.880
I grant you, it's...
No, because they're both...

19:27.960 --> 19:30.960
Are they the same price?
No. Do they have
the same performance? No.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Are they for the same thing?
No.

19:33.040 --> 19:38.280
As we argued about
our mismatched cars,
James arrived...

19:38.320 --> 19:41.880
...in an even more
mismatched Lada Riva.

19:41.920 --> 19:44.600
Well, that's not gonna
work, is it? I mean...

19:45.880 --> 19:48.760
This is...a Lada Riva.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.800
We know. We've already said.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.800
-I'm talking to the viewers.
-Yeah, but they already know,
don't they?

19:53.840 --> 19:56.440
-I said it in voice-over.
-You haven't said
voice-over yet.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.120
Yeah, he's done voice-over.
He said mine in voice-over
as well.

19:59.160 --> 20:03.400
This is whatever Jeremy said
it was. And I paid just £800,

20:03.440 --> 20:07.000
which leaves me £1,200
for the all-important
modifications.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.040
-And that is plenty.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.240
What modifications?

20:11.280 --> 20:12.600
The modifications to turn
them into fire engines.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.000
We're gonna turn
them into fire engines.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.240
Who said anything
about turning...

20:16.280 --> 20:18.040
Turn your car into a fire
engine using the money you
haven't spent

20:18.080 --> 20:19.520
out of the budget on the car.
I've spent £800.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.560
Well, I just borrowed that
from Audi.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.440
I made a phone call.
"Can I borrow a Nomad?"

20:23.480 --> 20:26.920
If you don't turn it
into a fire engine, you
won't win the competition.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.880
-I'm not in the competition.
-You are in the competition!

20:29.920 --> 20:32.520
James, we have tried time
and again to think of a way

20:32.560 --> 20:35.120
to turn something into
an amusing fire engine.
It can't be done.

20:35.160 --> 20:37.160
The fire engine already
exists. It's brilliant.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.680
It's already more compact
than you'd expect,

20:39.720 --> 20:43.240
faster than you'd expect,
you can fit the firemen
in it, and the water.

20:43.280 --> 20:45.720
-And they work very well.
-Exactly. That's
the challenge.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.960
You're only saying
you're not gonna turn
that into a fire engine

20:48.000 --> 20:50.520
-because it's
an air hostess car.
-It is not.

20:50.560 --> 20:51.560
Have you checked the boot
to make sure the luggage

20:51.600 --> 20:53.080
hasn't moved
during the journey?

20:53.120 --> 20:57.480
JEREMY: Then
our unscripted film
got even more unscripted.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.200
MAN: Can I have a selfie?

20:59.240 --> 21:01.240
-Um, well...
-OK.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.720
That's really up to you
if it's a selfie! I mean...

21:03.760 --> 21:06.880
If I do it, I'll get us
all in. I'm better at this.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.920
-I can get everybody in.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.880
-There you go.
-Brill.

21:12.920 --> 21:16.000
Come on, let's do whatever
we're doing. Doors to manual.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.800
-Cross check.
-OK.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.720
No air hostess jokes.

21:22.720 --> 21:26.480
Well, let's just go.
This is the point
at which we set off.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.440
We always do that.
Chat, chat...

21:28.480 --> 21:31.640
There'll be a line
of voice-over. I'll put some
voice-over in that says...

21:31.680 --> 21:33.360
Hang on. It'll say,

21:33.400 --> 21:36.360
"Since we weren't able
to decide what we were doing,

21:36.400 --> 21:39.480
-we all went
in different directions."
-OK.

21:39.520 --> 21:43.200
Since we weren't able
to decide what we were doing,

21:43.240 --> 21:45.000
we all went
in different directions.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.760
If he'd thought about it
in advance,

21:51.800 --> 21:56.560
Richard would have found a
quarry in which he could test
his action-lifestyle Nomad.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.200
But he hadn't. So...

22:03.000 --> 22:06.680
Yeah, we've...

22:06.720 --> 22:09.840
I don't feel I'm exploring
the outer reaches
of this car's potential

22:09.880 --> 22:11.880
in this traffic.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.320
JEREMY: Because I had satnav,
I fared better.

22:19.720 --> 22:21.760
And found the perfect road

22:21.800 --> 22:26.200
to open the taps
in this brilliant little TT.

22:32.760 --> 22:33.800
Oh!

22:35.800 --> 22:41.240
The engine in this car
is an absolute masterpiece.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.760
You've got as near as makes
no difference

22:50.800 --> 22:52.640
400 horsepower.

22:56.640 --> 23:01.960
And then there's that sort of
deep bass drum of torque
all the time.

23:04.360 --> 23:07.760
And listen to the noise
it makes. It sounds like...

23:09.680 --> 23:12.080
It sounds like...

23:12.120 --> 23:18.120
um...what does it sound...
It sounds like...

23:18.160 --> 23:22.520
It's like... It sounds like
a bear that's trodden
on a plug?

23:24.320 --> 23:26.080
No, a bear would go "ow",
wouldn't it?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.440
Soon I'd got it worked out.

23:32.480 --> 23:35.000
Oh! Listen to that.

23:37.120 --> 23:39.120
It sounds like
a happy hippopotamus.

23:45.320 --> 23:47.600
Now you would imagine
that putting

23:47.640 --> 23:50.400
this much power and this much
torque in an Audi...

23:50.440 --> 23:53.120
RICHARD: Hey, Jeremy,
do you have to put your phone
in flight mode

23:53.160 --> 23:55.160
when you drive one of those?

23:55.200 --> 23:58.560
Bob the Builder appears to be
here in his scaffolding.
Anyway, as I was...

23:58.600 --> 24:03.280
Would you mind checking round
your feet to make sure
there's nothing on the floor?

24:03.320 --> 24:05.640
As I was saying,
you would imagine...

24:05.680 --> 24:08.560
Have you folded
your tray table away
ready for when you stop?

24:08.600 --> 24:13.960
You would imagine that
putting this much power
and this much torque in a TT

24:14.000 --> 24:17.520
would make it wayward
and out of control, but no...

24:17.560 --> 24:21.080
Have you pointed out
the lavatories?

24:21.120 --> 24:25.120
There's nothing for it,
I'm gonna have to lose him,
get out of radio range.

24:25.160 --> 24:30.200
Right, Hammond, goodbye,
I'm losing you now.

24:30.240 --> 24:33.160
He probably thinks this is
just a dune buggy
with a number plate

24:33.200 --> 24:36.080
that's no good on the road.

24:36.120 --> 24:38.200
I shall now prove
that he's wrong.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.520
Charge!

24:44.120 --> 24:47.880
Well, it looks like
we've got ourselves
an unscripted race here.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.880
Ha-ha-ha. Oh. Oh.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.680
Hang on a minute, wait.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.560
Oh...

24:55.600 --> 24:57.800
What?

24:57.840 --> 24:59.600
Where's the road gone?

25:08.920 --> 25:12.200
If we'd sent scouts out
last week to check it out
like we usually do,

25:12.240 --> 25:14.440
we'd have known about this
and we wouldn't have done it.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.280
-But we didn't.
-No.

25:16.320 --> 25:18.320
-So we didn't.
-No.

25:18.360 --> 25:22.240
But the fact is, I really
want to show you
how fast this is.

25:22.280 --> 25:25.120
I-I'd like to see it
in my mirror,

25:25.160 --> 25:26.800
but there's just one other
thing before we do that.

25:26.840 --> 25:29.480
-I'd really like a jumper.

25:29.520 --> 25:32.840
So, the situation is,
we're gonna have a race

25:32.880 --> 25:35.920
after we've bought him
a jumper.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.800
-Yeah. Ideally...
-And while we're doing that,

25:37.840 --> 25:41.440
I should imagine in the edit
they'll cut back to James in
his stupid Lada.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.800
Yeah.

25:43.840 --> 25:47.640
JAMES: While those two
were bumbling about,
I'd found a workshop...

25:52.000 --> 25:55.240
Good.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.560
...and some health
and safety-obsessed locals...

26:00.200 --> 26:04.960
...so I could convert my Lada
into a fire engine. Oh, yes!

26:06.720 --> 26:09.360
JEREMY: Meanwhile,
back in the 21st century,

26:09.400 --> 26:10.920
Hammond
had bought his jumper

26:10.960 --> 26:14.520
and we were looking for
somewhere
to have our drag race.

26:14.560 --> 26:16.560
It's a dual carriageway.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.640
No, it's got buses on it.

26:18.680 --> 26:21.160
We can't race
where there's buses.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.640
And there was
another problem as well.

26:23.680 --> 26:26.000
It was obviously
a slow news week in Croatia,

26:26.040 --> 26:31.800
so we were being followed
everywhere by the paparazzi,
and TV crews.

26:33.800 --> 26:37.840
JEREMY: We can't do it here.
Everybody is filming us.

26:37.880 --> 26:42.400
RICHARD: This is impossible.
How are you supposed to have
a bloody race?

26:42.440 --> 26:45.200
Hammond, just pull over here.
Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

26:45.240 --> 26:48.320
Three, two, one, go.

26:52.160 --> 26:55.960
Stop, stop. Abort, abort.
He's paparazzi.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.440
We can't do it here.
It will be in the Daily Mail.

26:59.480 --> 27:03.960
Luckily though, Hammond
then had a sudden burst
of intelligence.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
RICHARD: Look,
there's an airport sign.

27:06.040 --> 27:09.320
Oh, yes.
Well spotted, Mr Hammond.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.800
Well, that's where we always
have drag races, isn't it?

27:11.840 --> 27:14.120
Business as usual.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:15.920 --> 27:17.320
However...

27:17.360 --> 27:20.680
RICHARD: There's a man
with a... This is like
a news crew here.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.800
-Hello.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.960
-We're just having a drive.
-Don't tell them we're doing
a drag race.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.360
You just said that
on the radio!

27:28.400 --> 27:31.040
-Hello.
-Hello. Are you having
a nice time?

27:31.080 --> 27:33.960
Very nice, thank you.
Look. So you can't be
cross with me.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.600
-Absolutely, yes.

27:35.640 --> 27:37.640
So, we're...we're just having
a drive around.

27:37.680 --> 27:39.680
Thanks.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.480
Yeah.

27:44.520 --> 27:47.280
Right, runway's there.
Jeremy's gone in
to ask permission.

27:47.320 --> 27:49.560
Drag race, humiliation,
end of, move on.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.800
RICHARD: Ah, nobody in?

27:54.840 --> 27:56.720
JEREMY: No. He says
it's a commercial airport,

27:56.760 --> 27:59.680
they're not gonna suspend
flight operations for us
to do a drag race.

27:59.720 --> 28:02.600
-I mean he has got a point.
-Yeah, I suppose so, but...

28:02.640 --> 28:04.240
Well...

28:04.280 --> 28:06.760
He also said if we had rung
a couple of weeks ago,

28:06.800 --> 28:08.760
he might have been able
to sort something out.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.800
-There's a reason
why we do that.
-Exactly!

28:13.840 --> 28:16.720
Here's how I'd sum up
unscripted television.

28:16.760 --> 28:22.120
You could sit and film
a waste disposal unit all day
long and every day long

28:22.160 --> 28:25.800
and transmit the pictures,
hoping that one day
a cat will fall into it,

28:25.840 --> 28:29.040
or you could actually push
a cat into it
and get it over with.

28:34.320 --> 28:39.680
Whilst James continued
with his stupid fire engine
conversion,

28:39.720 --> 28:42.280
Richard and I drove about
until eventually...

28:44.040 --> 28:47.200
...we found
an abandoned runway.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.920
-Right, ready!
-Do the tension thing
before the race.

28:49.960 --> 28:51.640
Oh, OK.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.440
Rev the engine.

28:56.840 --> 29:00.440
RICHARD: Yeah, he's got
400 brake horsepower
but his car is heavy.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.280
This only has
290 brake horsepower

29:02.320 --> 29:05.320
but it only weighs 670 kilos.

29:05.360 --> 29:09.600
So in actual fact this has
400 brake horsepower per ton.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.400
That doesn't.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.320
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
Hang on, Hammond?

29:17.360 --> 29:19.400
How are we going to start it?

29:19.440 --> 29:23.680
Normally we have a production
member with a chequered flag.
We haven't got that.

29:23.720 --> 29:27.560
We'll start it on the radio.
That's what we'll do,
we'll start it on the radio.

29:27.600 --> 29:31.320
I'll do it, OK?
No, wait a minute, hang on.

29:31.360 --> 29:34.120
No, I can't do it,
I've got launch control,
I need both hands.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.760
I can't do it,
I have to put the radio away

29:36.800 --> 29:39.040
before I set off.
I've got nowhere to put it.

29:41.320 --> 29:43.280
Shall we...why don't
we just get a local person?

29:43.320 --> 29:46.000
Yeah, that's not difficult,
for somebody just
to wave a flag. Yes.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.800
Right,
we'll cut back to James

29:47.840 --> 29:51.520
and then when we get back
we'll have a local person.

29:51.560 --> 29:53.440
JAMES: With Hammond
and Clarkson's camera crew

29:53.480 --> 29:56.520
looking for a local person
to start
their pointless race,

29:56.560 --> 29:59.280
I was finally in business.

30:02.960 --> 30:08.360
So, here we are. Just
a few hours and exactly
£1,200 later, my fire engine.

30:09.960 --> 30:12.120
My colleagues have been
very quick to point out

30:12.160 --> 30:15.080
that the fire engine
as a concept
is very well established,

30:15.120 --> 30:18.600
but this is something
different. You don't call
the fire brigade.

30:18.640 --> 30:24.360
I patrol in your area and you
summon me if you need
a fire putting out.

30:24.400 --> 30:28.520
Like an ice-cream van. And
to that end I have a siren.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.560
♪ Pop Goes The Weasel

30:30.600 --> 30:34.040
There is a large range of
fire-fighting accoutrements
on board.

30:34.080 --> 30:39.800
There are various hoses.
We've got CO2 for electrical
fires, fire blankets, sand.

30:39.840 --> 30:43.800
There's a water cannon here.
See, if I just turn on
that pump,

30:43.840 --> 30:48.720
steer with my knees, and
put on the windscreen wipers,

30:48.760 --> 30:51.400
and extinguish the fire.
There you go.

30:51.440 --> 30:54.920
And a lot of it comes through
the window and it... Jeez.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.760
Yeah, it's quite...
I may have made it

30:56.800 --> 30:58.760
a bit more complicated
than it needs to be.

30:58.800 --> 31:01.840
All I needed now
was a fire to put out.

31:01.880 --> 31:05.760
And since this was
an unscripted film,
it had to be a real one.

31:05.800 --> 31:11.400
I'm going to put my light on,
and my siren, just in case
anybody needs me.

31:11.440 --> 31:13.280
♪ Pop Goes The Weasel

31:16.040 --> 31:18.560
JEREMY: As Mr Softee
continued to drive round

31:18.600 --> 31:20.520
looking for
an unscripted fire,

31:20.560 --> 31:25.520
our camera crew had found
a typical Croatian
to start our race.

31:42.480 --> 31:44.480
It didn't work,
we didn't go anywhere.

31:44.520 --> 31:46.720
Um, oh, yeah.

31:46.760 --> 31:50.600
I-I dunno where I was.
My mind was elsewhere.

31:50.640 --> 31:54.800
I've had another idea.
Why don't we use her
as the finish line

31:54.840 --> 31:58.520
and then get, I don't know,
a sound recordist
to do the start?

31:58.560 --> 32:00.840
RICHARD: Yeah. That works.

32:00.880 --> 32:04.120
OK, problem sorted.
We have our starter.

32:04.160 --> 32:07.240
We've lost the distraction,
in quite a big way, actually.

32:14.720 --> 32:17.680
Three, two, one, go!

32:25.000 --> 32:26.960
I just cooked my clutch.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.680
Ah.

32:31.400 --> 32:35.680
That is
one hell of a finishing line.

32:35.720 --> 32:39.000
Back at the start line,
the news was bleak.

32:39.040 --> 32:42.040
I think I've broken
that drive shaft end.

32:42.080 --> 32:44.600
As spare parts
had to be sourced,

32:44.640 --> 32:49.160
I decided to take the
finishing line for a spin,
in my functioning Audi.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.320
-Woo-hoo!

32:52.800 --> 32:55.080
I need to go to feed my pet.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.120
She's got to go
and feed her cat.

32:57.160 --> 33:00.600
Right. You go off with the
old man, I'll fix the car.

33:04.560 --> 33:07.920
JAMES:
Fire service is now available
in your area.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.000
JEREMY:
Back in town, Fireman May

33:10.040 --> 33:12.760
still hadn't found
anything to put out.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.800
A kiosk, not on fire.

33:14.840 --> 33:19.360
Ice-cream shop, not on fire.
People with shopping,
not on fire.

33:20.720 --> 33:24.080
Are you having a fire?
Your last chance to summon

33:24.120 --> 33:28.440
the local fire brigade if
your mobile phone is ablaze.

33:28.480 --> 33:31.880
JEREMY: James
eventually realised that
in an unscripted world

33:31.920 --> 33:36.480
he wasn't going to find
a fire. So he deployed
his acting.

33:36.520 --> 33:42.120
Wait! Smoke! It looks as if
somebody's bin's caught fire.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.920
Not to worry,
I can deal with that.

33:59.800 --> 34:03.480
RICHARD: Several hours later,
with my car fixed,

34:03.520 --> 34:06.480
we were finally ready
for our showdown.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.800
-Let's do it, then.
-OK, let's do this.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.600
Let's sort this out.

34:19.760 --> 34:21.680
Three, two, one!

34:26.400 --> 34:28.120
Come on, baby, come on!

34:29.320 --> 34:31.080
Oh-ho-ho!

34:35.560 --> 34:38.160
No! Where's he come from?
Oh, no!

34:53.560 --> 34:56.520
What's that?

34:56.560 --> 35:00.240
Since when did a finishing
line have an opinion
on a result?

35:00.280 --> 35:02.440
I'm better than him.

35:06.040 --> 35:09.000
I don't know why you're
applauding, I really don't,

35:09.040 --> 35:12.600
because there you are,
Monaro Boy,

35:12.640 --> 35:15.800
that is what unscripted
television looks like.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.840
You've got
17 minutes of film there.

35:17.880 --> 35:21.040
All we did was buy a jumper -
which was actually
a sweatshirt -

35:21.080 --> 35:25.080
-It was.
-and have a ten-second
drag race. That's all we did.

35:25.120 --> 35:27.280
Hang on a minute.
I built a fire engine.

35:27.320 --> 35:29.120
Yeah, but it wasn't
a very good fire engine.

35:29.160 --> 35:31.360
-Yes, it was.
-I'm sorry, James,

35:31.400 --> 35:34.640
but your water cannon
would only be any use

35:34.680 --> 35:37.440
at putting out a fire
if the fire were on
your windscreen wipers.

35:37.480 --> 35:39.600
Anything further away than
that would be hopeless.

35:39.640 --> 35:42.760
-I put out that bin fire.
-Yeah, the bin fire
that you started.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.440
I did not start it.

35:44.480 --> 35:47.000
-Yes, you did.
-I might have done a bit.

35:47.040 --> 35:50.640
You did a lot. Anyway,
listen, we'll pick that up
later on.

35:50.680 --> 35:53.160
Now, though, it's time
for Celebrity Face Off.

36:04.400 --> 36:08.440
And once again we're asking
an important question.

36:08.480 --> 36:11.240
Who is the fastest classical
singer in the world

36:11.280 --> 36:14.720
who has an interesting
connection to the British
motor industry?

36:14.760 --> 36:17.680
Many, many people we could
have gone to for this one,

36:17.720 --> 36:19.880
but in the end
we selected two.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.320
And they are, and would you
please welcome them now,

36:22.360 --> 36:24.400
Michael Ball and Alfie Boe!

36:29.000 --> 36:31.520
Gentry men.

36:31.560 --> 36:33.560
Thank you very much.

36:33.600 --> 36:37.880
How are you? Have a seat.
You can go in either way.

36:37.920 --> 36:40.720
Both British this week.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.840
Welcome gentlemen,
welcome, welcome.

36:42.880 --> 36:44.840
Now, I've just described you
as classical singers

36:44.880 --> 36:47.200
but actually that's not
strictly true, is it?
You're not...

36:47.240 --> 36:49.760
-Well, it is for me. He's...
-I'm not.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.720
But classical music,
how was it described
in that movie In The Loop?

36:52.760 --> 36:56.080
It was all vowels? Which it
is, "aa-ee-aa-uu-uu".
Nobody likes classical music.

36:59.080 --> 37:01.400
Do you wanna come on tour?

37:01.440 --> 37:04.480
Whatever your music is,
however, it is unbelievably
popular.

37:04.520 --> 37:07.400
Last Christmas
you were number one,
with your joint album,

37:07.440 --> 37:12.600
and that kept The Stones
and Little Mix, whoever
the hell they are,

37:12.640 --> 37:14.560
off the number one,
and then this year,

37:14.600 --> 37:17.200
your album's keeping,
who is it, the Stereophonics?

37:17.240 --> 37:19.240
Yeah, we went
to number one again.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.800
And it's still...
it's doing all right.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.840
Cos I was looking...
I was thinking,
so what sort of music is it?

37:24.880 --> 37:27.400
And I was looking on YouTube,
at clips of you two singing.

37:27.440 --> 37:31.120
The audience is quite...old.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.200
Those are Michael's fans.

37:33.240 --> 37:36.560
Are they Michael's fans?
They're the ones that...
Do they smell of urine?

37:38.320 --> 37:39.920
-No!

37:39.960 --> 37:41.800
OK, we were just waiting,
they were...

37:41.840 --> 37:44.680
One of your audience
said that

37:44.720 --> 37:47.560
they'd bought our album,
so there is someone here
who has our album.

37:49.480 --> 37:50.960
Well, "she",
there's a surprise.

37:52.880 --> 37:55.320
-She's now denying it.

37:55.360 --> 37:59.800
Yeah, she's denying it.
She's surrounded by
a load of bikers, that's why!

37:59.840 --> 38:02.640
We've got to get onto
these connections with
the motor industry

38:02.680 --> 38:04.280
cos that's what people
are interested in here,

38:04.320 --> 38:07.240
which is a genuinely
fascinating thing that we've
managed to find with you two.

38:07.280 --> 38:09.760
-We'll start with you
if we may.
-Sure.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.880
Michael, your dad
was world sales chief
for British Leyland.

38:11.920 --> 38:16.160
That's where he ended.
He started off as an Austin
apprentice back in the '50s

38:16.200 --> 38:18.560
and eventually ended up
as world sales chief at BL

38:18.600 --> 38:22.280
under Michael Edwardes and
the whole Red Robbo scenario,

38:22.320 --> 38:25.160
and when they actually
went bust. So...

38:26.880 --> 38:29.360
So you grew up in
a British Leyland household?

38:29.400 --> 38:31.480
-Totally, yeah.
-So how did you ever
get to school?

38:34.600 --> 38:37.400
We did have some dogs.
We even had some...

38:37.440 --> 38:39.400
Well, did they make anything
that wasn't a dog?

38:39.440 --> 38:40.600
No.

38:42.280 --> 38:45.360
My favourite one
had to be the Allegro Equipe.

38:45.400 --> 38:48.880
The ugliest car,
with the "Go Faster" stripe.

38:48.920 --> 38:51.520
Yellow and brown
"Go Faster' stripe".

38:51.560 --> 38:53.200
And matching nylon interior.

38:53.240 --> 38:56.120
Didn't your dad progress up
to things like E-Types
and what have you?

38:56.160 --> 38:59.160
Yeah, yeah. I remember him
crashing the E-Type.

38:59.200 --> 39:02.440
Taking me to school, funnily
enough. Third day he had it

39:02.480 --> 39:04.320
and someone
into the back of him,

39:04.360 --> 39:07.040
he went into the back of,
well, underneath a lorry.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.440
There's a lot of nose
to go under a lorry,
let's be honest, with an E.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.440
The fascinating thing is
he launched the Mini.

39:11.480 --> 39:14.800
He was the guy, he was given
a 500-quid budget.

39:14.840 --> 39:17.400
He was taken in by Issigonis
and all of them, they said,

39:17.440 --> 39:21.040
"This is the car, we want
to make some headlines.
Do a thing with it."

39:21.080 --> 39:24.720
And he came up with
this concept of "It's Magic"

39:24.760 --> 39:28.160
and put on one of the
first-ever car launches.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.680
didn't he do the thing
about how many things
can you get in a Mini?

39:30.720 --> 39:32.760
That's right.
That's absolutely right.

39:32.800 --> 39:35.400
Which became a huge thing,
for those of us old enough
to remember,

39:35.440 --> 39:37.120
they were always seeing what
they could get in a Mini.

39:37.160 --> 39:38.640
800 Boy Scouts.

39:41.120 --> 39:44.400
I'm gonna move it on,
if I may, to, not your dad,
but you...

39:44.440 --> 39:47.760
actually worked
on the shop floor at TVR?

39:47.800 --> 39:51.000
I did. I started off...
I was there
for about two or three years.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.440
There are some questions I've
got about TVR, because I...

39:53.480 --> 39:56.120
As I understand it, people
who worked on the shop floor

39:56.160 --> 39:58.280
would often,
before the cars were painted,

39:58.320 --> 40:01.520
or underneath the carpets
on the boot floor,
leave rude messages.

40:01.560 --> 40:04.000
-Yeah.

40:04.040 --> 40:06.440
Absolutely! There's a guy
driving around
in a TVR Griffith

40:06.480 --> 40:09.000
with, on the bonnet,
with a big penis shape on it.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.400
-Underneath.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.800
Yeah. And there's a car door
somewhere with
"Alfie is a twat".

40:16.360 --> 40:19.000
I think I've got that one!

40:19.040 --> 40:22.240
They basically got some
things right about TVR, so...

40:22.280 --> 40:25.080
You always think,
they couldn't possibly
have done this?

40:25.120 --> 40:27.880
If you've got a TVR
and you lift up the carpet
in the boot...

40:27.920 --> 40:30.040
There'll be a message
somewhere, yeah.

40:30.080 --> 40:32.360
Wasn't it a way of passing
messages onto one another
down...

40:32.400 --> 40:34.160
Well, there wasn't really
a production line, but...

40:34.200 --> 40:37.240
Yeah, that was the, you know,
the flatting shop would pass

40:37.280 --> 40:42.760
a message down to the paint
shop, and, yeah, usually rude
and annoying, but, yeah.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.840
Didn't they used to spray
the backs of your heads?

40:44.880 --> 40:48.800
Yeah, they'd come up to you
and just straight across
the back of your neck.

40:48.840 --> 40:51.320
With the paint? Which was
cyanide? Yeah, it was.

40:51.360 --> 40:54.280
Cyanide-based paint, yeah!
Yes!

40:54.320 --> 40:57.040
I came out in a bit of a
rash, but I'm all right now!

40:57.080 --> 40:59.160
Why did they use
cyanide paint?

40:59.200 --> 41:02.520
Just cos it was the metallic
feel that they'd get from it.
That real...

41:02.560 --> 41:04.560
-Yeah.

41:04.600 --> 41:07.240
So that must have hurt? Well,
being sprayed in cyanide?

41:07.280 --> 41:10.800
It did a little bit.
It stung for a while.

41:10.840 --> 41:14.400
The worst thing was being
shoved through the powder
coating room. That was...

41:16.720 --> 41:18.720
That really...that really
got under your skin.

41:18.760 --> 41:20.960
That itched like crazy,
that did. That was rough.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.080
It's a wonder TVR went out
of business, isn't it?

41:23.120 --> 41:25.800
It makes you wonder,
"How did that happen?"

41:25.840 --> 41:28.480
Cos they had the engine,
presumably your dad's
engines, weren't they?

41:28.520 --> 41:31.080
Cos they were using
the V8s from...Rover V8s?

41:31.120 --> 41:34.960
Yeah. They built this engine
bay and they mounted this
engine on a plinth

41:35.000 --> 41:37.680
and then stuck the exhaust
into this metal box,

41:37.720 --> 41:42.480
bricked around the metal box,
fired it up on the first test
of one of the engines,

41:42.520 --> 41:46.880
and they didn't turn
the extractor fan on.

41:46.920 --> 41:48.600
Oh, God!

41:48.640 --> 41:52.680
So this metal box
was turning into
this huge bomb, basically.

41:52.720 --> 41:56.120
It backfired,
lit up everything,
bricks flying everywhere.

41:56.160 --> 41:59.800
All the paintwork, cars
were smashed to pieces
with bricks,

41:59.840 --> 42:03.200
and the metalworking, the
foreman came up and said,
"What the  wrong?"

42:03.240 --> 42:06.960
He said, "Just get on with
it. Come on, clean up, we're
all right." And that was it.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Was anyone ever killed there?

42:09.040 --> 42:11.200
Not as I...
Oh, there was a guy, yeah.

42:17.040 --> 42:19.040
Yeah, he...

42:19.080 --> 42:22.160
I think...

42:22.200 --> 42:24.200
-We're laughing.
-Yeah, I know, it was crazy.

42:24.240 --> 42:27.480
Yeah. He did, he went
in the spray booth
without his mask on

42:27.520 --> 42:30.000
and just started spraying and
keeled over and that was it.

42:30.040 --> 42:32.040
So he disposed of himself
with cyanide?

42:32.080 --> 42:34.520
Yeah. It was crazy.
Well, the paint job was good.

42:34.560 --> 42:36.920
He said, "Ooh, I've done it."

42:38.520 --> 42:40.320
So how did you get from there
to singing?

42:40.360 --> 42:44.080
Well, I was working
in the factory
and working on a Griffith

42:44.120 --> 42:47.000
and I was polishing it away

42:47.040 --> 42:50.800
and this guy was overhearing
me singing along
to the radio,

42:50.840 --> 42:52.800
and he said, you know,

42:52.840 --> 42:56.120
"You've got a good voice,
you should try out for this
company in London."

42:56.160 --> 43:00.560
And I took the day off work,
went down to London and...

43:00.600 --> 43:02.600
sang for this company
and got taken on.

43:02.640 --> 43:07.280
Came back to TVR, handed in
my notice, and my foreman
went crazy.

43:07.320 --> 43:10.440
He said, "What do you wanna
go and do that for"

43:10.480 --> 43:14.240
He said, "Why do you wanna
leave this job?
You're on 60 quid a week."

43:14.280 --> 43:16.200
Well, there we are, then.

43:16.240 --> 43:20.080
Didn't you try to get Michael
to give you a leg up
in the music business?

43:20.120 --> 43:23.280
When I was at college,
I stayed in the same area
of London

43:23.320 --> 43:26.240
that he was living at the
time, I was renting a room,

43:26.280 --> 43:30.840
and I posted a note through
his door to see if he'd give
us a bit of advice and...

43:30.880 --> 43:32.680
never heard a  thing.

43:35.480 --> 43:38.040
-See, you look nice.
-Oh, I know.

43:38.080 --> 43:41.200
You have that nice-looking
face, but actually there
beats a cold heart.

43:41.240 --> 43:43.080
Oh, I'm a cold bastard.

43:43.120 --> 43:45.760
Absolutely. I mean, no, I
still haven't given him any.

43:45.800 --> 43:48.280
Could you remember it? You
don't remember the postcard?

43:48.320 --> 43:50.440
-No!

43:50.480 --> 43:52.920
-Yeah, it did.

43:52.960 --> 43:57.360
Probably! When I didn't hear
anything from him, you know.
It's the only way forward.

43:57.400 --> 44:00.960
So, anyway, you're here,
in the depths of the English
countryside,

44:01.000 --> 44:03.640
and how did it go
on the track?

44:03.680 --> 44:05.480
I'm dreading this.
I'm so nervous.

44:05.520 --> 44:07.000
Are you?
I loved every second.

44:07.040 --> 44:10.120
I was told there is quite
a bit of needle between
who is the fastest today?

44:10.160 --> 44:12.520
BOTH: Yeah.

44:12.560 --> 44:14.760
And there's a big dinner
riding on this.

44:14.800 --> 44:17.000
-A really major dinner.
-Who shall we go
with first?

44:17.040 --> 44:19.160
Let's have a look at...

44:19.200 --> 44:21.400
-Michael's lap.
-OK.

44:21.440 --> 44:26.200
JEREMY: Here we are.
And it's a smooth start.
Up into second.

44:26.240 --> 44:29.400
-Pedal to the metal.
-Well, pedal to the carpet.

44:29.440 --> 44:32.440
Now, I like to brake
half way through this one.

44:32.480 --> 44:34.240
And you do as well.

44:34.280 --> 44:37.560
I think it makes sense cos
then you've got more speed
going onto the tricky bit,

44:37.600 --> 44:39.280
which is coming up now,

44:39.320 --> 44:42.120
cos we've run out of money
and there it is, the gravel.

44:42.160 --> 44:46.480
Really, keeping it quite tidy
through there,

44:46.520 --> 44:48.160
and tidy through there
as well.

44:48.200 --> 44:51.680
Who the hell
puts gravel on a race track?

44:51.720 --> 44:53.720
I told you,
we haven't got the money.

44:53.760 --> 44:56.360
Right, now, this is the...
I can't remember what it's
called.

44:56.400 --> 44:58.360
Gravelsel, that's what it is,

44:58.400 --> 45:01.680
Named after the Carousel
of the Nürburgring.
Onto difficult bit two.

45:01.720 --> 45:03.480
Is that any good?

45:03.520 --> 45:04.880
-That's pretty good
-It's quite slow.

45:04.920 --> 45:06.600
Cos sometimes
if you keep it tidy

45:06.640 --> 45:08.920
and it looks slow,
it's actually fast.

45:08.960 --> 45:11.960
That's a hard corner. Cos it
always is more slippery than
you think.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.480
Right, now, smoothly onto
the main stra...

45:15.520 --> 45:18.520
Well, not smoothly,
virtually stopping.

45:18.560 --> 45:20.480
I'm loving this!

45:20.520 --> 45:23.360
Good. Now this is
supposed to be flat
but it's quite greasy today,

45:23.400 --> 45:27.920
so you probably wouldn't be.
You definitely aren't.

45:27.960 --> 45:30.600
Right,
final corner coming up now...

45:30.640 --> 45:35.640
Ooh, more understeer, not as
bad as last week. But there
we are, across the line!

45:37.880 --> 45:39.880
-I mean...

45:39.920 --> 45:44.200
-I didn't crash.
-You definitely didn't crash.

45:44.240 --> 45:46.280
Slow and steady
wins the race.

45:46.320 --> 45:48.320
Or gets around. What's that?

45:48.360 --> 45:52.480
These are the times. But
we're not gonna reveal them
until we've had a look at

45:52.520 --> 45:56.400
Alfino, as we liked to call
you all week, when you were
coming off.

45:56.440 --> 45:58.880
Right, let's have a look at
Alfie's lap.

45:58.920 --> 46:02.360
-Oh, fog's come down.
MICHAEL:
He gets special effects.

46:02.400 --> 46:04.360
Right, and he's disappeared.

46:04.400 --> 46:07.440
All right, Bally,
I'm coming after you.

46:07.480 --> 46:10.160
God, that
really is a pea souper.
Could you see all right?

46:10.200 --> 46:12.200
-No, it was...
-Ooh, there's an excuse,
Alfie.

46:12.240 --> 46:15.440
-You should say,
"Yes, easily".
-It was easy. I was fine.

46:15.480 --> 46:19.920
That's nice and smooth
through there. Now, are you
exuberant on the gravel?

46:19.960 --> 46:22.480
Let's have a look,
as we come up here.

46:22.520 --> 46:24.800
Ooh, that's wide!

46:27.840 --> 46:31.720
This gravel turn is as wide
as Michael's vibrato.

46:35.480 --> 46:38.680
JEREMY: That traction control
is really letting you have
some angle there

46:38.720 --> 46:40.920
as we come now
to Difficult Bit Two.

46:40.960 --> 46:44.680
Cutting that corner nicely,
sliding wide on that one.

46:44.720 --> 46:47.800
Very different styles
you two have got here.

46:47.840 --> 46:52.760
God, that really is
fishtailing down there.
Onto the tarmac once again.

46:53.920 --> 46:55.920
We'll ignore that.

46:55.960 --> 46:57.960
MICHAEL: That's illegal!

46:58.000 --> 47:00.160
You almost stopped as well.
Now, here we go.

47:00.200 --> 47:03.160
Yay!

47:03.200 --> 47:06.080
JEREMY: I never would have
had you as a swearist.
Right, now...

47:06.120 --> 47:08.120
That seems fast but wide.

47:08.160 --> 47:10.560
Ooh, he's off, he's off!

47:10.600 --> 47:14.200
No, he's back on.
And stopping. Why? No, not...

47:14.240 --> 47:16.360
Virtually stopping.

47:16.400 --> 47:19.080
And then across the line.

47:21.720 --> 47:23.520
I actually
don't like this bit,

47:23.560 --> 47:26.160
having to reveal the times
to two people
when it really matters.

47:26.200 --> 47:28.480
-Really matters.
-It does.

47:28.520 --> 47:30.120
Anyway,
I've got the times here.

47:30.160 --> 47:32.160
Are you nervous?
I'm really nervous.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.400
I've shat myself.

47:35.920 --> 47:38.880
It smells like
one of your audiences.

47:43.160 --> 47:45.600
-I've gone again!
-Right.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.600
-Michael Ball.
-Yes.

47:50.640 --> 47:54.920
You did it in one minute...
23.3.

47:57.160 --> 47:59.160
My heart is pounding.

47:59.200 --> 48:01.480
Alfie Boe. One minute...

48:01.520 --> 48:03.120
twenty...

48:04.560 --> 48:06.560
...four point four.

48:06.600 --> 48:09.080
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

48:18.840 --> 48:20.840
Too exuberant.

48:20.880 --> 48:22.880
I think, too exu...

48:22.920 --> 48:24.920
-You probably had more fun.
-Yeah.

48:24.960 --> 48:29.000
But you were faster.
By actually 1.1 seconds.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.760
1.1 seconds?

48:30.800 --> 48:33.600
-Yeah. Do you want me
to say it again?

48:33.640 --> 48:36.240
It's not the winning,
it's the taking part!

48:40.400 --> 48:42.440
So there we are,
ladies and gentlemen,

48:42.480 --> 48:45.400
Alfie Boe and the fastest
classical singer

48:45.440 --> 48:47.760
with a connection
to the British
motor industry,

48:47.800 --> 48:49.360
-Michael Ball!
-Thank you!

48:58.240 --> 49:01.840
Now, this week
we are in Croatia,

49:01.880 --> 49:04.960
making a totally unplanned
and unscripted film

49:05.000 --> 49:07.880
in which we attempt to turn
cars into fire engines.

49:07.920 --> 49:09.920
No, James, we are not.

49:09.960 --> 49:12.800
Well, I am.
Yes, but to be quite clear,

49:12.840 --> 49:16.000
Jeremy and I
are doing something
completely different.

49:24.760 --> 49:26.720
JEREMY:
Having proved that my Audi

49:26.760 --> 49:30.800
was faster in a straight line
than Richard's
Honda-powered Nomad,

49:30.840 --> 49:36.040
I was now determined
to show him it was also
faster at rallying.

49:36.080 --> 49:38.680
I'm confident
for several reasons.

49:38.720 --> 49:42.560
It's got four-wheel drive,
it's got a differential that
moves the power

49:42.600 --> 49:46.600
to whichever wheel
is best able to handle it
at any given moment,

49:46.640 --> 49:48.760
and it has
a fabulous gearbox.

49:48.800 --> 49:53.360
But most of all I'm confident
because this is the
first Audi I've ever driven

49:53.400 --> 49:56.280
that has a front on it.

49:56.320 --> 50:00.680
What I mean by that
is it has a front end that
goes where you point it.

50:00.720 --> 50:03.880
You flick the wheel and it
goes in the direction
you selected.

50:03.920 --> 50:07.320
There's no understeer.
You then have to sort out
the back end, obviously,

50:07.360 --> 50:12.320
but that's OK,
that's what all top drivers,
such as myself, want.

50:15.200 --> 50:20.040
Does that mad old ape
really believe
his air hostess chariot

50:20.080 --> 50:28.000
will stand a chance off-road
against this custom-built
off

50:28.040 --> 50:34.840
Has he got £3,000 worth
of Fox off-road long-travel
coil

50:34.880 --> 50:36.880
No, he hasn't.

50:36.920 --> 50:41.000
Can he glance out the side
and see exactly how his
wheels are positioned?

50:41.040 --> 50:44.440
No, he can't. Does he have
a hydraulic handbrake?

50:44.480 --> 50:48.080
No. Does it weigh
just 670 kilograms?

50:48.120 --> 50:51.000
No, he weighs more than that.

50:51.040 --> 50:58.160
JEREMY: All we needed to sort
this out was a loose-surface
gravel track of some kind.

50:58.200 --> 51:04.360
Obviously nothing planned,
we just drive round
until we find somewhere.

51:04.400 --> 51:08.800
Can't do it there,
too many trees. That's just
a little bit of gravel.

51:08.840 --> 51:10.920
Can't go there,
that's an orchard.

51:10.960 --> 51:15.360
Somebody will be cross.
There must be somewhere!

51:15.400 --> 51:19.040
Meanwhile, after his success
with the staged bin fire,

51:19.080 --> 51:22.000
James was now
getting carried away.

51:22.040 --> 51:23.800
Ah, looks like a job for me.

51:35.400 --> 51:37.400
-My pleasure.
-Ah...

51:43.320 --> 51:44.760
JEREMY:
Back out in the countryside,

51:44.800 --> 51:49.280
Richard and I had stopped by
some nice lakes.

51:49.320 --> 51:54.360
But, because this was
an unscripted film, we didn't
have much to say about them.

51:59.240 --> 52:01.240
I like the waterfalls.

52:01.280 --> 52:03.040
Yeah,
the waterfalls are nice.

52:06.040 --> 52:07.760
What's your favourite
of the waterfalls?

52:09.720 --> 52:11.720
-I like that one.
-I like that big one.

52:13.600 --> 52:15.600
-Yep.
-Oh.

52:15.640 --> 52:17.640
Hold that a minute.

52:17.680 --> 52:22.360
Right, I've done
a quick chart of how
we're performing so far.

52:22.400 --> 52:24.440
We aren't...?

52:24.480 --> 52:26.800
RICHARD: I'm not performing.
-Right, Economy.

52:26.840 --> 52:28.840
Three points for me,
most economical obviously,

52:28.880 --> 52:30.280
followed by Hammond, two,
you, one.

52:30.320 --> 52:33.720
Top Speed. It's the other
way round. You're the
fastest, three points,

52:33.760 --> 52:36.840
two for you and one for me,
the slowest. Now, Value.

52:36.880 --> 52:41.680
You get a point for
every pound you save
under the £2,000 budget,

52:41.720 --> 52:44.840
but you lose a point for
every pound you go over it,
OK?

52:44.880 --> 52:48.080
So I am winning that.
My car car was £800.

52:48.120 --> 52:51.720
I score 1,200. You...

52:51.760 --> 52:55.840
Minus 65,000...

52:55.880 --> 52:57.880
-I think there's something
wrong with him.

52:57.920 --> 52:59.680
645.

52:59.720 --> 53:01.720
I can't write on
a vertical surface.

53:01.760 --> 53:04.800
Let's have a writing
competition. You lose!

53:04.840 --> 53:07.160
Hang on, your car,
you lose...

53:07.200 --> 53:08.880
Minus 48,000.

53:08.920 --> 53:11.800
-I can't be minus anything.
-Hang on, hang on,

53:11.840 --> 53:13.840
have you included
his optional windscreen?

53:13.880 --> 53:15.880
-Don't encourage him!

53:15.920 --> 53:17.920
-It's an optional windscreen.

53:17.960 --> 53:19.560
1,500 quid.

53:19.600 --> 53:22.360
Minus 1,500.
That's interesting.

53:22.400 --> 53:24.560
Minus minus is a plus,
which is a minus.

53:24.600 --> 53:26.800
James, this is very riveting,
but it's irrelevant.

53:26.840 --> 53:28.880
It's not irrelevant.

53:28.920 --> 53:32.240
It's like saying, "Jeremy,
you lost to Manchester United
yesterday."

53:32.280 --> 53:34.440
I wasn't there,
and I wasn't taking part.

53:34.480 --> 53:36.480
-You are taking part in this.
-I'm not.

53:36.520 --> 53:40.520
Yes, you are. Just because
you can't be bothered
and you've done it wrong.

53:40.560 --> 53:44.160
You're losing. Catch up here.
You've got
Fires Extinguished,

53:44.200 --> 53:47.600
Water Capacity. You can still
claw it back for the total.

53:47.640 --> 53:50.560
But at the moment, mate,
you're losing.

53:50.600 --> 53:53.640
Fires Extinguished.
So far I've done two...

53:55.280 --> 53:59.080
Having thrown James's chart
in the lake,

53:59.120 --> 54:03.080
Hammond and I resumed
our search for a rally stage.

54:03.120 --> 54:05.880
And soon, we found one.

54:08.680 --> 54:12.560
This would be perfect
for our timed shoot-out.

54:15.160 --> 54:18.200
Hammond elected to go first.

54:18.240 --> 54:21.560
Right, this bush
is the start/finish line, OK?

54:21.600 --> 54:23.600
-OK. Yes.
-Good.

54:23.640 --> 54:25.640
No, hang on.
I don't trust you to time me.

54:25.680 --> 54:27.680
I'm not. Sylvia is.

54:27.720 --> 54:29.520
Oh, great,
the human finish line.

54:29.560 --> 54:30.600
Yes!

54:31.760 --> 54:33.320
SYLVIA: Tri...

54:34.920 --> 54:36.680
Go!

54:39.520 --> 54:41.280
This is it.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.080
A little touch of the brakes.

54:46.120 --> 54:49.320
Don't wanna drift too wide.

54:49.360 --> 54:52.760
Two-wheel drive means I've
gotta take advantage of every
bit of grip I can find.

55:02.600 --> 55:04.360
A lot of rocks!
A lot of rocks!

55:07.960 --> 55:10.920
Come on. Get your
concentration on, Richard!

55:24.960 --> 55:27.600
Now, floor it!
Everything we got!

55:41.000 --> 55:45.600
-Two minutes,
five point seven.

55:45.640 --> 55:48.240
Well, that's...
that's probably brilliant.

55:48.280 --> 55:50.280
Two minutes,
five point seven. Right,

55:50.320 --> 55:52.680
-My turn.
-OK.

55:52.720 --> 55:54.120
Watch and learn.

56:00.080 --> 56:02.040
Go!

56:04.200 --> 56:09.440
Right, I have the whole car
set up in its dynamic mode.

56:09.480 --> 56:12.960
So, the throttle response,
the gearbox, the suspension,

56:13.000 --> 56:16.800
they're all now sharper
than an architect's pencil.

56:19.160 --> 56:21.040
Jesus! God's truth.

56:24.200 --> 56:28.880
I am not the world's best
loose-surfaces expert.

56:28.920 --> 56:30.960
I'm not even
in the top 20 million.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.800
But, in a car like this,
you feel like you have
all the control you need.

56:43.800 --> 56:46.000
Absolutely unbelievable.
And flick it in.

56:48.880 --> 56:51.760
That front end on this
is just phenomenal.

56:57.760 --> 56:59.520
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

57:13.600 --> 57:17.400
Yes! Go, go! Go, Jeremy!

57:18.800 --> 57:20.560
Oh, yeah, totally unbiased.

57:23.600 --> 57:26.960
-The finish line looks happy.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.840
SYLVIA: Perfect time. Two
minutes, three point seven.

57:30.880 --> 57:33.320
Oh, come on!

57:33.360 --> 57:35.360
That's just because...

57:35.400 --> 57:37.080
She can't mess with time.

57:37.120 --> 57:40.680
Time is just an entity
on its own. You can't
mess around with it.

57:40.720 --> 57:42.880
-Jeremy!

57:42.920 --> 57:44.920
-No.

57:44.960 --> 57:46.960
Hammond.

57:47.000 --> 57:50.600
May. What, now

57:50.640 --> 57:52.640
OK. No, yes.

57:52.680 --> 57:55.440
Yes, yes, yes,
I've got satnav.
I'll find it. All right, bye.

57:55.480 --> 57:57.360
He says he's organised
a demonstration

57:57.400 --> 57:59.800
and he wants us two
to come and watch it.

57:59.840 --> 58:01.520
-Yeah.

58:01.560 --> 58:03.960
I'd personally prefer to do
another race of some sort.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
-No, there's no point.

58:07.040 --> 58:09.280
-The finish line is biased.
Why don't we...

58:09.320 --> 58:11.160
No. Let's go. I'd rather go
and see James

58:11.200 --> 58:13.200
than be humiliated by another
biased...

58:13.240 --> 58:14.960
-Why don't we have
a race in a sauna?
-No.

58:18.800 --> 58:24.920
As James was a fair few miles
away, we had time to sum up

58:24.960 --> 58:26.720
what we'd learned
about our cars.

58:28.200 --> 58:31.600
I know the Audi TT
has an image problem.

58:31.640 --> 58:34.480
I know people think
it's an air hostess's car.

58:36.760 --> 58:39.400
But the RS
genuinely is different.

58:39.440 --> 58:41.520
The RS is like...

58:41.560 --> 58:43.480
Oh, not again. Um...

58:45.720 --> 58:49.160
It's like...

58:49.200 --> 58:53.760
It's difficult to think of
anyone who really needs
a supercharged Ariel Nomad.

58:53.800 --> 58:57.280
Even an emergency off-road
vet would have nowhere

58:57.320 --> 59:01.880
to put their tools to do
anything when they got there,
so it's useless.

59:01.920 --> 59:05.200
It's also draughty,
expensive, noisy...

59:06.440 --> 59:08.840
...and brilliant!

59:08.880 --> 59:11.320
I adore it!

59:11.360 --> 59:18.360
It's the best toy in the
world, and what finer praise
could you have for any car?

59:18.400 --> 59:25.200
Eventually we met up with our
colleague, who was eager to
explain what he had in mind.

59:25.240 --> 59:28.440
I'm making
a simulated bush fire,

59:28.480 --> 59:30.440
the start of a bush fire
to demonstrate

59:30.480 --> 59:32.680
how quickly my roving fire
engine could just put it out

59:32.720 --> 59:35.440
before it develops into
something like
a massive conflagration.

59:35.480 --> 59:40.240
This bush fire, OK,
is going to start
right next to a road.

59:40.280 --> 59:42.960
Which happens to be next
to where you've parked
your fire engine?

59:43.000 --> 59:45.200
I'm not... I'm gonna drive in
and put it out.

59:45.240 --> 59:47.920
But you know where it is!
You've just started it.

59:47.960 --> 59:49.760
I know! It's a demonstration,
you morons!

59:49.800 --> 59:51.960
It's two and a half feet
from a road!

59:52.000 --> 59:53.960
Bush fires happen miles out
in the middle of...

59:54.000 --> 59:57.120
All right, go and build one
out there. It doesn't make
any difference.

59:57.160 --> 59:59.360
Why don't we go
and start a fire for him?

59:59.400 --> 1:00:01.200
That's more realistic.
You travel to the fire,

1:00:01.240 --> 1:00:03.000
wherever we've started it,
and put it out.

1:00:03.040 --> 1:00:06.520
Off you go.

1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:09.040
RICHARD: Having travelled
a realistic distance
from the road,

1:00:09.080 --> 1:00:12.040
we soon had
a bush fire on the go.

1:00:12.080 --> 1:00:14.360
JEREMY:
Ooh, hello. Hello! Hello!

1:00:15.560 --> 1:00:17.560
Yes!

1:00:17.600 --> 1:00:19.600
That is speeding things up,
isn't it?

1:00:19.640 --> 1:00:21.640
Isn't it? There you go.

1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:25.880
What it's doing is catching
on. The wind moves it along
and it gets bigger.

1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:29.200
It's quite good.
Another bit there, look.

1:00:29.240 --> 1:00:32.280
Then we told James
to come and do his stuff.

1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:46.320
Relax, I am coming
to put out the fire.

1:00:46.360 --> 1:00:49.240
RICHARD: However, because
of his leisurely pace,

1:00:49.280 --> 1:00:52.760
the fire had grown a bit
by the time he got there.

1:00:52.800 --> 1:00:54.320
Jeez.

1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:00.800
Pressure.

1:01:04.520 --> 1:01:06.520
It's too big!

1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:08.320
I've run out of water!

1:01:15.800 --> 1:01:17.800
This isn't gonna work.

1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:19.840
I think what we've
established here

1:01:19.880 --> 1:01:23.880
is that he's only capable
of putting out fires
that he's started himself.

1:01:23.920 --> 1:01:26.920
Yeah, that are nearby
and contained.

1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:30.880
I haven't got anything left!

1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:35.240
JEREMY: Luckily,
at this point, the real
fire brigade arrive.

1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:11.000
Thank you.

1:02:20.680 --> 1:02:22.600
It's a six-tonne
lump of water...

1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:24.640
Hold on. Hold on, hold on.

1:02:24.680 --> 1:02:28.400
Let's have a look
at the final scores on my
water-damaged scoreboard.

1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:29.800
No, James.
No, there's no point.

1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:32.000
You get minus a million
cos that was the cost

1:02:32.040 --> 1:02:34.000
of the real fire brigade
that had to come,

1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:36.200
and I get plus a million
for winning everything.

1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:39.520
No, hang on, the only reason
your doors-to-manual Audi

1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:44.160
beat the magnificent Nomad
is that you fed
the finishing line's cat.

1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:46.600
And because it was faster.
And better in every way.

1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:50.440
It is a superb car, that TT,
but you can't have one.

1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:52.200
Because of
the air hostess thing?

1:02:52.240 --> 1:02:53.720
No, because
I've driven three examples

1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:55.360
and every single one
has had squeaky brakes.

1:02:55.400 --> 1:02:57.720
You can hear it in the film,
and it drives you mad.

1:02:57.760 --> 1:03:00.040
Yeah, that's unforgivable.

1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:02.600
And on that terrible
disappointment,
and that total waste of time,

1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:05.040
it's time to end. Thank you
very much for watching.

1:03:05.080 --> 1:03:06.800
Have a very happy New Year.

1:03:06.840 --> 1:03:08.960
Unless you're watching this
in April, in which case,
whatever. Goodbye.
