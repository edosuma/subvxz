01:35.031 --> 01:36.525
Well, you've heard
the old expression

01:36.700 --> 01:38.740
''Children should be seen
and not heard. ''

01:38.953 --> 01:40.447
Well, now
there's a government survey

01:40.622 --> 01:43.992
that wants to know what kids have
to say on a variety of subjects.

01:44.169 --> 01:46.957
But one of those subjects
has some people up in arms.

01:47.131 --> 01:48.506
Evany Bear reports.

01:48.716 --> 01:50.923
Oh, this is it, this is it,
turn up the sound.

01:51.136 --> 01:55.431
Many of the questions pertain to sex,
and therein lies the controversy.

01:55.642 --> 01:57.385
Critics contend
the government-funded survey

01:57.561 --> 01:59.637
promotes a message
that casual sex is okay.

01:59.814 --> 02:01.688
- There's John!
- Proponents insist otherwise.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.985
- Who's he?
- The managing editor of the paper.

02:05.196 --> 02:06.821
They claim
that teen pregnancy, AlDS

02:06.990 --> 02:09.741
and other consequences
of adolescent sexual behaviour

02:09.952 --> 02:13.404
cannot be prevented unless we know
something about the behaviour itself.

02:13.624 --> 02:16.198
- But not everyone agrees.
- And there's Mrs. Teasley.

02:16.378 --> 02:18.371
Oh, Andrea.

02:19.507 --> 02:22.343
- l look awful.
- Oh, you do not.

02:22.552 --> 02:25.388
How come l don't see
your bones up there, squeef?

02:25.640 --> 02:27.763
- There l am right there.
- Where?

02:27.935 --> 02:30.972
Right there.
That's my elbow, right there. See?

02:31.523 --> 02:34.809
Well, we could see your whole face
if the sign wasn't covering it.

02:35.027 --> 02:36.984
Our public health
is not served by prying

02:37.155 --> 02:39.314
into every corner
of our children's lives.

02:39.533 --> 02:42.534
This is a wrongful allocation
of taxpayer money,

02:42.704 --> 02:45.908
and we think the department should
freeze the funding immediately.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.663
No matter what happens tomorrow,
one thing remains clear:

02:48.837 --> 02:51.328
When it comes to the issue
of teenage sexuality,

02:51.507 --> 02:53.749
everyone's passion
can become inflamed.

02:53.927 --> 02:55.801
For Newswatch, l'm Evany Bear.

02:56.347 --> 02:58.885
Well, you kids
must have had some day.

02:59.685 --> 03:01.345
Quite an experience.

03:01.562 --> 03:04.136
Can't believe l ended up
on the cutting-room floor.

03:04.316 --> 03:06.190
Better luck next time, champ.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.234
Well, Mrs. Walsh,
it's getting to be that time.

03:08.405 --> 03:09.899
l think we ought to
head on up to bed.

03:10.073 --> 03:11.104
Okay. Night, all.

03:11.283 --> 03:13.276
- Good night, everybody.
- Night.

03:13.453 --> 03:16.823
Yeah, Miss Walsh, l think
it's getting to be about that time.

03:16.999 --> 03:20.914
- We'd better head on up to bed.
- Right.

03:21.255 --> 03:24.422
Well, you can't blame a guy
for trying, right?

03:29.391 --> 03:31.550
So staff meeting
first period tomorrow, huh?

03:31.727 --> 03:33.305
- Yeah.
- Great.

03:33.479 --> 03:35.139
Great.

03:37.401 --> 03:38.776
Great.

04:04.937 --> 04:07.345
Hey, Brandon. You didn't tell me
your folks were having

04:07.524 --> 04:09.481
the parents' association meeting
at your house.

04:09.652 --> 04:11.811
That's because l'm the last one
to know. When is it?

04:11.988 --> 04:15.523
Hey, hey. So, Walsh,
did you see us on the news?

04:16.119 --> 04:18.278
Hey, sorry your mug
didn't make the cut.

04:18.454 --> 04:20.281
Yours almost broke our picture tube.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.125
John, your face was all over the TV.

04:22.294 --> 04:24.999
l tried to call you to tell you it was on,
but there was no answer.

04:25.172 --> 04:28.376
Oh, well, l was at Brandon's house.

04:35.353 --> 04:37.761
Aren't they the darling duo?

04:37.939 --> 04:40.062
Kelly, what's wrong?
You sound cranky.

04:40.234 --> 04:44.102
Just seeing David reminds me
of how much my mom likes his dad.

04:44.281 --> 04:47.448
What can she see in a guy whose idea
of a good time is a gum massage?

04:47.619 --> 04:49.944
Kelly, he's a dentist.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.574
- All right, who's available third period?
- l am.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.410
You're already facilitating
the assembly.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.745
- l can cover both.
- Eager little beaver, aren't we?

04:56.923 --> 04:59.165
Why? Just because
l don't phone it in, Walsh?

04:59.593 --> 05:02.713
- Hey, Mrs. T.
- Are they ready for us? We're all set.

05:05.434 --> 05:07.676
ls everything all right, Mrs. Teasley?

05:07.854 --> 05:10.524
l'm afraid l have some
disappointing news.

05:11.692 --> 05:12.937
They're hypocrites, that's all.

05:13.111 --> 05:15.685
Two-faced ignoramuses.
Or is it ignorami?

05:15.864 --> 05:17.524
No, what it is, is a travesty.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.491
lt's a triumph of ignorance
over knowledge.

05:19.661 --> 05:22.033
That's good.
You should put that in your editorial.

05:22.206 --> 05:25.373
What's going on? l was supposed to
get out of English Lit for the sex survey.

05:25.544 --> 05:27.287
A public-health survey, Steve.

05:27.463 --> 05:30.417
- Whatever. When's it gonna start?
- lt's been cancelled.

05:31.176 --> 05:32.587
Postponed because of the rain?

05:32.803 --> 05:34.594
No, cancelled, over, finito.

05:35.265 --> 05:38.931
Great. Now l actually have
to read Brave New World.

05:39.896 --> 05:43.396
So listen, if you need any help
with that editorial, l'm at your disposal.

05:43.609 --> 05:46.610
Hey, Andrea. Flogged any more
school administrators today?

05:46.780 --> 05:49.236
Yeah, Brandon said
that you really gave it to Mrs. Teasley.

05:49.409 --> 05:51.152
You should have heard her.
She was--

05:51.328 --> 05:52.573
Explosive.

05:52.746 --> 05:54.074
l don't blame you.

05:54.290 --> 05:55.369
l mean, it's really unfair.

05:55.542 --> 05:57.914
lt's like they don't give a damn
about what we have to say.

05:58.087 --> 05:59.249
Well, my mom will be happy.

05:59.422 --> 06:01.331
She doesn't think
they should ask kids about sex

06:01.508 --> 06:03.086
because it might give them ideas.

06:03.302 --> 06:06.007
Donna, doesn't your mom read
the newspaper?

06:06.181 --> 06:09.099
There were a million teenage
pregnancies in this country last year.

06:09.268 --> 06:13.516
Every year, 3 million teenagers
contract sexually transmitted diseases.

06:13.691 --> 06:16.645
That is not because of any survey.

06:16.861 --> 06:20.112
- Andrea, settle down.
- No, people are dying, Brandon.

06:20.283 --> 06:22.572
More Americans have died
from the AlDS virus

06:22.744 --> 06:25.069
than were killed in the Vietnam
and Korean wars combined.

06:25.247 --> 06:27.370
More are gonna die
in the next two years

06:27.542 --> 06:31.243
than in the ten years since the virus
was discovered. How can--?

06:31.422 --> 06:33.498
How can people
ignore this problem?

06:35.886 --> 06:38.508
Give them hell, Andrea.
Catch you guys later.

06:39.349 --> 06:42.553
l mean, honestly, how can any of
these questions get people worked up?

06:42.729 --> 06:45.101
''Have you ever had
sexual intercourse before?''

06:45.274 --> 06:46.305
Excuse me?

06:46.484 --> 06:48.144
''Have you ever used
any of the following:

06:48.320 --> 06:50.111
Birth-control pills, lUD, condoms?''

06:50.280 --> 06:51.442
You know what l was thinking?

06:51.616 --> 06:54.368
After school, maybe you and l
could go over to the college library--

06:54.536 --> 06:55.816
- Yes!
- Really?

06:56.664 --> 06:58.491
l mean, no.

06:58.667 --> 07:00.161
Oh, well, it was just a thought.

07:00.377 --> 07:04.755
No, no, l mean, l think l know
how to make them take us seriously.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.837
l can't believe
l didn't think of it before.

07:08.012 --> 07:09.554
Tonight's board
of education meeting.

07:09.723 --> 07:13.223
And although the report
was accepted by the board,

07:13.394 --> 07:17.179
it was not filled out in triplicate
until after the deadline had passed.

07:18.151 --> 07:20.060
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

07:20.237 --> 07:22.645
lt's on the agenda.
lt's too late to stop now.

07:22.823 --> 07:25.694
Not if we just stand up and go.

07:25.911 --> 07:28.485
Andrea Zuckerman.

07:29.791 --> 07:31.665
ls Andrea Zuckerman here?

07:31.877 --> 07:34.499
Here goes nothing.

07:38.469 --> 07:41.589
Hello, Andrea.
How's the student press corps?

07:41.974 --> 07:43.967
Fine, thanks, Mr. Beale.

07:44.143 --> 07:46.681
l know it's late,
so l'll get right to the point.

07:47.564 --> 07:50.518
l hereby propose that the
West Beverly Hills Board of Education

07:50.693 --> 07:53.481
move to consider adopting a plan
to make condoms available

07:53.697 --> 07:55.904
to the students on the campus
of West Beverly High.

07:59.538 --> 08:02.243
Well, l so move.

08:02.417 --> 08:04.410
l second that motion.

08:04.587 --> 08:06.496
- Sheila.
- Why not?

08:06.673 --> 08:09.164
We ought to at least consider it.

08:16.185 --> 08:17.763
You guys should have
seen her up there.

08:17.979 --> 08:20.019
l mean, they were practically
interrogating her,

08:20.191 --> 08:22.314
but she stayed calm
and stood her ground.

08:22.485 --> 08:24.110
He gets a little
carried away sometimes.

08:24.279 --> 08:25.821
Come on, Andrea. You were brilliant.

08:25.990 --> 08:27.817
You were tough.
You were inspirational.

08:27.993 --> 08:30.318
But how was she really, John?

08:30.913 --> 08:32.491
- On the house.
- Thanks, Nat.

08:32.707 --> 08:34.498
So when does this
new programme start?

08:34.710 --> 08:36.203
lt's only on the table at this point.

08:36.379 --> 08:38.668
Not everybody's gonna go for it.

08:38.881 --> 08:40.542
Yeah, you want me to talk
to them for you?

08:40.717 --> 08:43.470
You're the expert, huh, Nat?
You jungle stud.

08:43.679 --> 08:46.681
- Thanks for being so supportive, Nat.
- Don't mention it.

08:46.851 --> 08:48.974
Of course, if it were my daughter,

08:49.146 --> 08:52.313
l'd lock her in the closet
till she was 35.

08:54.528 --> 08:57.102
Don't laugh. That's what my mom
would like to do with me.

08:57.281 --> 08:59.238
Over my dead body.

08:59.451 --> 09:01.610
David, easy, tiger.

09:02.163 --> 09:05.615
Donna, maybe you should just
not tell your mom about the meeting.

09:05.834 --> 09:08.670
She never misses a meeting. And she
especially wants to meet your mom.

09:08.838 --> 09:11.875
lt could be a real free-for-all.
l hope your mom's prepared for that.

09:12.092 --> 09:15.841
You guys know Cindy Walsh,
nothing fazes her.

09:22.481 --> 09:25.851
Jackie, Mel.
Grab a chair, they're going fast.

09:26.027 --> 09:28.945
- Hi, where's Kelly?
- She's at home.

09:31.201 --> 09:33.241
- Hi, Felice.
- Jackie, how are you?

09:33.412 --> 09:35.203
Comme ci, comme ca, a little bug.

09:35.415 --> 09:36.494
- Oh, l'm sorry.
- Hi, Bren.

09:36.667 --> 09:37.947
Hi, l'm glad you made it.

09:38.127 --> 09:40.167
Oh, Mrs. Walsh,
this is my mother, Felice.

09:40.338 --> 09:42.081
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:42.257 --> 09:44.464
You're a very brave woman
to host one of these things.

09:45.094 --> 09:46.553
l am?

09:46.721 --> 09:48.678
- Knock, knock.
- Andrea, hi.

09:48.849 --> 09:50.427
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.

09:50.643 --> 09:53.514
The infamous Andrea Zuckerman?

09:53.731 --> 09:55.356
Mom.

09:55.566 --> 09:57.773
Cindy. Cindy.

09:57.945 --> 09:59.772
l'd like you to meet Bill Sloane.

09:59.947 --> 10:03.198
Hi. Any friend of Mel's
is a friend of ours.

10:03.410 --> 10:06.447
Well, thanks. l thought this was
supposed to be a parents' meeting.

10:06.664 --> 10:07.695
Oh, yes.

10:07.874 --> 10:10.959
Oh, well, but that's just my daughter
and her friends.

10:11.170 --> 10:13.044
They're really only here to observe.

10:15.259 --> 10:17.501
Find your father.

10:19.765 --> 10:21.473
l don't want my kid
to be able to walk up

10:21.642 --> 10:24.098
to a school nurse and say,
''Give me a condom.''

10:24.313 --> 10:25.344
lt's as simple as that.

10:25.523 --> 10:28.145
- At least they'd provide instruction.
- Mel, please--

10:28.318 --> 10:31.154
lf l wanted my kid to receive
instruction, l would teach him.

10:31.364 --> 10:32.858
- Bill--
- As simple as that.

10:33.032 --> 10:35.654
Then just decide for your own kid,
and not for everybody else's.

10:35.870 --> 10:38.492
Don't you decide how my tax dollars
are gonna be spent.

10:38.707 --> 10:40.700
Look, we're all gonna pay
a lot more down the road

10:40.876 --> 10:42.916
if we don't take some action
before it's too late.

10:43.087 --> 10:44.285
Gentlemen, please!

10:46.133 --> 10:49.550
Mrs. Martin has been waiting patiently.
Let's give her the floor.

10:49.763 --> 10:52.599
- Thank you.
- Boy, David's dad is very...

10:52.767 --> 10:54.890
- Belligerent?
- Outspoken.

10:55.103 --> 10:57.012
Yeah, but so is my mom.

10:57.231 --> 10:58.476
Hi, everybody.

10:58.691 --> 11:00.933
Dr. Martin would have liked
to have been here tonight,

11:01.111 --> 11:04.231
but unfortunately
he's at a medical conference.

11:04.449 --> 11:07.486
Addressing his colleagues
on this very subject, in fact.

11:08.162 --> 11:10.285
And l'm sure he'd be a lot better
at this than me,

11:10.457 --> 11:13.577
but what he would have said
to all of you is this:

11:14.629 --> 11:18.081
Year after year, the experts
have been telling us that condoms

11:18.259 --> 11:22.008
are the most effective way
to prevent the spread of AlDS

11:22.222 --> 11:24.179
and other
sexually transmitted diseases.

11:24.976 --> 11:29.140
And yet, year after year,
more people are getting sick.

11:29.315 --> 11:30.560
More people are dying.

11:30.734 --> 11:33.023
Children are dying.

11:33.404 --> 11:37.948
lt's very clear there's a lot
we don't know about this disease.

11:38.160 --> 11:41.779
lt's clear something is not working.

11:42.374 --> 11:45.411
l submit condoms aren't the answer.

11:51.302 --> 11:53.425
They work when people
use them right.

11:53.597 --> 11:55.756
Not always.

11:56.309 --> 11:58.468
As a concerned parent,

11:58.645 --> 12:02.145
as an educated woman
and as a member of the generation

12:02.317 --> 12:05.188
that barely survived
the sexual revolution,

12:05.404 --> 12:09.866
l'm tired of kids being told,
''Well, you really shouldn't have sex,

12:10.035 --> 12:14.614
but if you do, nod, nod, wink, wink,
here's a condom, go have fun.''

12:15.167 --> 12:20.293
No. No, we owe our children
more than a mixed message.

12:20.883 --> 12:22.342
She does have a point.

12:22.510 --> 12:25.962
We owe them the very best guidance
we can give them.

12:26.182 --> 12:28.507
And the only advice we can give
in good conscience,

12:28.685 --> 12:34.475
the only 1 00 percent reliable advice,
is to use that old-fashioned method

12:34.693 --> 12:37.065
that is just simply gonna have to
become fashionable again.

12:37.238 --> 12:39.112
And that method is abstinence.

12:46.375 --> 12:47.834
Andrea, say something.

12:48.044 --> 12:50.120
And if they don't listen,
which a lot of them won't,

12:50.297 --> 12:52.290
do you just shrug and say,
''Well, l told you so''?

12:52.466 --> 12:55.551
- Donna.
- l'm sorry, Mom, but--

12:55.762 --> 12:57.802
What is this,
a student-council meeting?

12:58.015 --> 13:01.052
Bill, l'd like to hear
what Donna has to say.

13:04.148 --> 13:06.770
Oh, gosh. Andrea, you go ahead.

13:06.944 --> 13:09.696
- No, you go ahead.
- Yeah, come on.

13:12.201 --> 13:15.618
lt's just, if you say that kids
don't need condoms

13:15.789 --> 13:18.327
because they shouldn't be
having sex in the first place,

13:18.501 --> 13:22.202
well, you're overlooking
two very important things.

13:22.423 --> 13:24.997
One is that a lot of kids
are having sex.

13:25.176 --> 13:27.085
And the other is that they are kids.

13:27.971 --> 13:32.468
l mean, it's like if you have
a swimming pool in your backyard,

13:32.644 --> 13:34.601
you can tell your children
not to go in it,

13:34.772 --> 13:36.931
you can even build a fence around it,

13:37.109 --> 13:40.977
but if you know that they're going
to find a way into that water,

13:41.156 --> 13:43.908
don't you think you ought to teach
those kids how to swim?

13:48.373 --> 13:50.413
Couldn't have said it better.

13:59.722 --> 14:03.851
lf you would have told me ten years
ago that l would be in my living room

14:04.019 --> 14:06.012
arguing about condoms
in front of my kids,

14:06.189 --> 14:07.767
l would have said you were nuts.

14:07.941 --> 14:10.777
l remember when the big controversy
of the PTA was over

14:10.945 --> 14:13.816
where they were gonna hold
the next holiday bake sale.

14:13.991 --> 14:17.076
l thought David's dad
was gonna knock out that Sloane guy.

14:17.287 --> 14:19.114
Yeah, well,
he would have deserved it.

14:19.331 --> 14:21.656
Hey, l know Bill Sloane
from racquetball.

14:21.834 --> 14:23.661
He's a good guy
and he's a very caring father.

14:23.837 --> 14:26.375
lf he's so worried about his son
getting his hands on a condom,

14:26.549 --> 14:28.458
why doesn't he just have
a little talk with him?

14:28.635 --> 14:31.423
Honey, it's hard for some people to talk
with their kids about sex.

14:31.639 --> 14:33.964
lt wasn't hard for you guys.

14:36.562 --> 14:38.851
- Speak for yourself, bro.
- No, l'm serious.

14:39.065 --> 14:42.316
Remember the time Cheryl came out
from Minnesota and we--?

14:46.533 --> 14:48.656
Well, maybe...

14:48.870 --> 14:50.697
Personally,
l think it's getting a lot easier,

14:50.872 --> 14:52.663
with all the media exposure
and everything.

14:52.833 --> 14:54.031
Well, that's true.

14:54.210 --> 14:57.081
l mean, ever since Magic Johnson
announced that he was HlV-positive,

14:57.256 --> 15:00.626
it seems like all you hear about
is condoms and safer sex.

15:00.802 --> 15:02.711
And abstinence.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.342
Right.

15:07.519 --> 15:09.726
Hey, before you know it,
frank discussions of sexuality

15:09.898 --> 15:12.568
may be so common
that we don't even think twice about it.

15:13.319 --> 15:17.068
Well, as you say, it's a new world.

15:17.282 --> 15:18.990
Really. Who'd have thought
Andrea Zuckerman

15:19.160 --> 15:21.830
would be leading
the next sexual revolution?

15:21.997 --> 15:23.740
Whoever would have thought
that Donna Martin

15:23.916 --> 15:26.834
would be leading
the next sexual revolution?

15:27.796 --> 15:29.670
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:33.053 --> 15:36.090
So, guys, about last night,
pretty big meeting, huh?

15:36.266 --> 15:38.674
- You should have been there.
- Your dad got really into it.

15:38.852 --> 15:41.723
Yeah, well,
l heard Donna was really...

15:41.898 --> 15:44.769
- Vocal?
- Yeah, and she was pretty...

15:44.944 --> 15:49.239
- Persuasive.
- Yes, yes, really persuasive.

15:49.533 --> 15:52.618
l think after she finished talking, a lot
of people had changed their minds.

15:52.787 --> 15:54.614
Yeah, definitely.

15:54.790 --> 15:58.041
So do you think l should,
you know...?

15:58.253 --> 15:59.415
Make a move?

15:59.630 --> 16:01.706
l have to admit,
it has crossed my mind.

16:01.924 --> 16:03.252
Well, here's a shocker:

16:03.426 --> 16:06.262
- l bet it's crossed hers too.
- Yeah.

16:08.809 --> 16:11.680
So you think this condom-availability
plan is gonna go through, huh?

16:11.854 --> 16:14.013
Well, Andrea thinks it's a shoo-in,
but l don't know.

16:14.191 --> 16:17.358
lt only passed at the parents' meeting
by a couple of votes.

16:17.570 --> 16:20.904
But how soon do you think
before we get some?

16:21.200 --> 16:23.608
Go to a drugstore, man.

16:24.663 --> 16:27.333
Excuse me, man. Excuse me.
John. Hey, John, what's going on?

16:27.500 --> 16:29.243
Andrea's being interviewed
for the news.

16:29.878 --> 16:32.500
- Get out of here.
- No, l swear.

16:33.132 --> 16:35.172
They got wind of the upcoming
school-board vote,

16:35.344 --> 16:37.171
now we're national news.

16:37.346 --> 16:39.837
But why? We're certainly
not the first high school in America

16:40.016 --> 16:41.178
to consider a condom programme.

16:41.351 --> 16:43.759
No, but we're the first one
in Beverly Hills to consider it.

16:43.938 --> 16:46.939
- Beverly High didn't get on it already?
- Not yet.

16:47.109 --> 16:49.517
Because otherwise,
we are gonna inherit the society

16:49.696 --> 16:53.113
that pays the price
for this generation's failure to act.

16:54.619 --> 16:56.826
Brandon,
can l talk to you a moment?

16:56.997 --> 16:58.657
Yeah, sure.

16:58.875 --> 17:00.120
Hi, David.

17:00.293 --> 17:03.294
- Donna, hi, how you doing?
- Great.

17:05.383 --> 17:07.126
So your mom
wasn't too hard on you?

17:07.301 --> 17:09.377
Oh, well, she disowned me.

17:09.555 --> 17:10.717
Very funny.

17:10.890 --> 17:12.218
Actually, l think she'd like to.

17:12.392 --> 17:14.634
But l told her, sometimes
you just have to take a stand.

17:14.811 --> 17:16.805
You know what l'm saying?

17:17.357 --> 17:19.349
Absolutely.

17:19.569 --> 17:21.311
Of course she's entitled
to speak her mind,

17:21.488 --> 17:23.813
but being interviewed on campus
without clearing it first

17:23.991 --> 17:25.569
puts me in a very awkward position.

17:25.742 --> 17:28.413
And now she's insisting
that the Blaze do its own sex survey

17:28.580 --> 17:30.822
and all sorts of unrealistic demands.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.334
Well, you know Andrea, she just gets
real passionate about the issues.

17:34.505 --> 17:37.709
Well, perhaps you can help her
tone down some of that passion.

17:37.884 --> 17:39.426
The last thing any of us wanna see

17:39.595 --> 17:42.383
is her jeopardise her position
as editor on the paper.

17:42.557 --> 17:43.802
l'll talk to her.

17:43.976 --> 17:46.514
- Thanks, Brandon.
- Okay.

17:49.149 --> 17:53.194
Two-thirds of sexually active teens
are between the ages...

17:56.492 --> 17:59.612
l hear that Andrea Zuckerman
was interviewed on the news today.

18:00.372 --> 18:02.163
Can we please talk about
some other subject?

18:02.333 --> 18:04.242
Would you smell this?

18:04.419 --> 18:06.744
All l've been hearing about
for days is Andrea Zuckerman

18:06.923 --> 18:08.251
and her mighty condom crusade.

18:08.425 --> 18:11.510
lt smells fine to me.
What do you think?

18:12.221 --> 18:13.252
Me too.

18:13.431 --> 18:16.267
l mean, this whole condom thing
is already such old news.

18:16.435 --> 18:18.344
l'll just have tea.

18:18.521 --> 18:20.929
My stomach is really on the fritz.

18:21.108 --> 18:24.145
Well, believe it or not, some people
haven't gotten the message yet.

18:24.321 --> 18:28.320
You were telling me all about birth
control before l even got my period.

18:28.493 --> 18:30.201
Well, with a wild child like you,

18:30.370 --> 18:33.537
l figured we were better safe
than sorry.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.078
But how many kids your age

18:35.252 --> 18:38.372
are emotionally ready to be involved
in a sexual relationship?

18:39.090 --> 18:40.833
lt's so much easier with a boy.

18:41.051 --> 18:44.052
You just give them a copy of Playboy
and say good luck.

18:44.222 --> 18:45.681
Dad.

18:45.891 --> 18:48.014
l'm just kidding.
They know l was kidding.

18:48.227 --> 18:51.264
But the point is it's not
just about birth control anymore.

18:51.440 --> 18:53.100
lt's really about disease prevention.

18:53.275 --> 18:55.268
lt's a different world
than when we were young.

18:55.654 --> 18:57.362
Yeah. ln our day,

18:57.531 --> 19:01.399
we had to walk ten miles through
the snow just to get to a love-in.

19:03.372 --> 19:05.661
Well, l may be out of step
with most of my friends,

19:05.875 --> 19:07.915
but as much as l agree condoms
are necessary,

19:08.087 --> 19:10.329
l don't think
they're necessary in school.

19:10.506 --> 19:13.876
l mean, like you said, a lot of kids
just aren't ready to deal with sex.

19:14.053 --> 19:16.758
Most of the boys
are totally obsessed with it as it is.

19:16.932 --> 19:18.474
Next thing you know,
they're gonna be

19:18.642 --> 19:20.551
throwing condom balloons
off the second floor.

19:20.728 --> 19:22.222
Oh, come on, they're not that bad.

19:22.439 --> 19:25.643
Yes, they are. David, tell them.

19:26.528 --> 19:27.903
Tell them what?

19:28.071 --> 19:31.156
These days, isn't just everyone
totally preoccupied with sex?

19:33.620 --> 19:35.945
Not that l've noticed.

19:36.708 --> 19:39.282
l'm kind of nervous and
l see them sitting behind the counter,

19:39.461 --> 19:41.121
but the cashier
is being really obnoxious

19:41.297 --> 19:43.705
and she's yelling out the prices
at the top of her lungs--

19:43.884 --> 19:46.720
Come on, get to the point.
Did you get any or no?

19:47.597 --> 19:50.801
Check it out. Did you ever know
there were so many varieties?

19:50.977 --> 19:53.813
- What'd you get, one of each?
- Here, take some.

19:53.980 --> 19:55.854
No, thanks.

19:56.067 --> 19:57.727
You don't need any?

19:57.902 --> 20:01.106
No, not at the moment.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.276
Brandon, l don't know what
you people from the Blaze

20:04.453 --> 20:07.787
are trying to accomplish, but l would
appreciate it if you'd leave me out of it.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.199
- What are we doing?
- The personal journals.

20:10.753 --> 20:12.331
Oh, that.

20:12.505 --> 20:14.877
Your name just came up.
lf you don't wanna do it...

20:15.092 --> 20:17.844
- l don't wanna do it.
- Would you like us to leave so you--?

20:18.012 --> 20:19.803
No, Andrea's trying to
round up some people

20:19.973 --> 20:21.847
to write about some
personal experiences.

20:22.059 --> 20:24.384
Some personal sexual experiences,

20:24.562 --> 20:26.934
for the school newspaper, of all things.
l'd rather die.

20:27.149 --> 20:28.643
Yeah, l wouldn't wanna
do that either.

20:28.818 --> 20:31.654
Yeah, man, goes for me too, bro.
Scratch my name off that list.

20:31.864 --> 20:35.399
Yeah, l hear you.
Look, l'll tell Andrea you said no, okay?

20:35.619 --> 20:38.490
Andrea Zuckerman doesn't always
take no for an answer.

20:38.664 --> 20:41.749
Now she actually wants us to go
and hand out condoms on the street.

20:43.421 --> 20:45.248
She wants us to do what?

20:46.717 --> 20:49.208
Excuse me,
when did we start giving out condoms?

20:49.387 --> 20:52.507
No, not condoms. Just these
informational packets they sent over.

20:52.683 --> 20:54.842
- Who sent over?
- My uncle.

20:55.019 --> 20:58.223
He's a psychologist. He's affiliated with
this theatre group in West Hollywood.

20:58.399 --> 21:01.353
They do a show on safer sex and then
have a question-and-answer period.

21:01.528 --> 21:03.735
Afterwards, they hand out
these informational packets

21:03.906 --> 21:05.614
to people who request them.

21:05.783 --> 21:07.242
Well, now, correct me if l'm wrong,

21:07.411 --> 21:09.285
l'm still on the editorial board
of this paper.

21:09.455 --> 21:11.744
l should have been consulted
about this, shouldn't l?

21:11.917 --> 21:13.874
We had to make a decision.

21:14.587 --> 21:16.876
Can l talk to you for a second?

21:23.015 --> 21:24.758
Andrea, why are you
so obsessed about this?

21:24.934 --> 21:27.935
You told me the school board's gonna
vote 3-2 in favour of your proposal.

21:28.105 --> 21:30.513
My sources definitely think
they're gonna postpone the vote.

21:30.691 --> 21:33.016
- Gives us something to bargain with.
- What do you mean?

21:33.236 --> 21:35.395
ln Massachusetts,
some kids took action on their own,

21:35.573 --> 21:37.233
of course they were
handing out condoms,

21:37.409 --> 21:39.651
but the school board sat down
and negotiated with them.

21:39.828 --> 21:41.156
Besides, it's for a good cause.

21:41.330 --> 21:44.166
lt's a community-service project
whose sole purpose is to educate kids

21:44.334 --> 21:45.532
about AlDS and safer sex.

21:45.753 --> 21:48.707
Andrea, l'm not knocking the project.
lt's the protocol.

21:48.882 --> 21:50.709
l should have been asked
about this, not told.

21:51.427 --> 21:53.135
l'm sorry,
you're never around anymore.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.054
Hey, l was working.
l have a job, remember?

21:55.224 --> 22:00.053
l know, but this thing has momentum,
it has got a life of its own.

22:00.981 --> 22:03.817
Maybe you should get a life
of your own before it's too late.

22:03.985 --> 22:05.776
- Excuse me?
- You know,

22:05.946 --> 22:08.817
sometimes you get so caught up
in your quest to save the world,

22:08.992 --> 22:11.115
you don't see
that you're alienating people.

22:11.328 --> 22:13.321
Like who?

22:14.082 --> 22:15.991
Just trust me on this, okay?

22:16.168 --> 22:18.659
The only people who ever respond
to these in-your-face tactics

22:18.838 --> 22:21.329
are already on your side.

22:23.511 --> 22:26.715
l know what this is about,
you're jealous.

22:27.349 --> 22:30.054
- Jealous?
- Yes.

22:30.228 --> 22:33.929
You can't stand it that John Griffin
got on TV and you didn't.

22:34.150 --> 22:37.983
And now you resent me
because l'm in the spotlight.

22:38.155 --> 22:41.026
So you got it all figured out, huh?
You got me all figured out.

22:41.201 --> 22:43.241
Everything in the world
is black and white.

22:43.412 --> 22:44.954
Let me tell you something, it isn't.

22:45.123 --> 22:48.041
Not with me, and not with an issue
like having condoms in school.

22:48.252 --> 22:50.826
l'm sorry, you're wrong.
The statistics are black and white.

22:51.006 --> 22:53.378
There are proven facts,
people just don't want to admit it.

22:53.551 --> 22:54.713
What you don't want to admit

22:54.886 --> 22:56.879
is that you don't know about
the other part of it.

22:57.055 --> 23:00.009
The part that doesn't show up
in statistics or surveys.

23:00.184 --> 23:01.809
And what, pray tell, is that?

23:02.354 --> 23:04.263
The feelings. The sex.

23:05.191 --> 23:06.685
lf you had a little more experience,

23:06.860 --> 23:09.731
you'd know that love
is not a public-health issue.

23:12.033 --> 23:14.869
Thanks for bringing that
to my attention.

23:16.205 --> 23:18.198
- Andrea...
- Thanks a lot.

23:26.803 --> 23:29.211
Come on, Brandon. l mean,
even in the best of circumstances,

23:29.389 --> 23:31.465
you're a sore subject with Andrea.

23:31.684 --> 23:34.009
And then, when you put her down
for being inexperienced--

23:34.187 --> 23:38.186
-Hey, l wasn't putting her down.
- Then what were you doing, Brandon?

23:38.652 --> 23:42.104
lt came out wrong, okay? How could
l know she'd be so sensitive about it?

23:42.323 --> 23:43.568
What'd you expect?

23:43.742 --> 23:46.364
Just mentioning it probably
set off all those scared feelings.

23:46.996 --> 23:50.864
You know, ''l'll be a virgin forever, there
must be something wrong with me.''

23:51.085 --> 23:52.460
Brenda, that's ridiculous.

23:52.670 --> 23:54.129
Maybe, but it's also normal.

23:54.339 --> 23:55.750
How do you know
she feels that way?

23:55.924 --> 23:58.594
l don't. But l do know
how she feels about you,

23:58.762 --> 24:00.505
and l'm sure that only made it worse.

24:02.099 --> 24:03.558
Great.

24:04.269 --> 24:06.226
Want me to talk to her?

24:06.522 --> 24:08.930
No, l gotta clean up
my own messes.

24:09.150 --> 24:11.143
Yeah, well, you better take
a big shovel.

24:11.320 --> 24:13.277
Hi, handsome.

24:13.489 --> 24:14.948
Can l give you a lift somewhere?

24:15.116 --> 24:17.156
That might be arranged.

24:17.995 --> 24:20.237
Hey, you're gonna desert me
in my hour of need?

24:20.457 --> 24:22.995
- We'll send you a postcard.
- See you tomorrow.

24:29.510 --> 24:31.301
What?
What are you laughing about?

24:31.471 --> 24:33.843
- l'm laughing at you.
- What?

24:35.936 --> 24:38.510
Andrea, l'm really worried
about the board meeting tonight.

24:38.689 --> 24:40.017
Donna's mother is on the agenda.

24:40.191 --> 24:42.599
lt's okay. We have the facts
and votes on our side.

24:42.778 --> 24:45.898
You know, we ought to get there early
to make sure we get good seats.

24:46.950 --> 24:49.488
You want me to stop by your
grandma's house to pick you up?

24:49.662 --> 24:52.580
- How about l just meet you there?
- Okay.

24:52.749 --> 24:56.913
Oh, before l forget, our first
true confession came in this morning.

24:57.088 --> 25:00.089
The personal journals
for the special edition.

25:00.259 --> 25:01.290
Right.

25:01.469 --> 25:04.554
l think this one's really good.
Maybe a page-one prospect.

25:04.724 --> 25:06.931
Don't you wanna hear it?

25:08.020 --> 25:10.060
All right.

25:10.231 --> 25:14.609
lt's called ''Okay, So l'm a Virgin.''

25:14.820 --> 25:16.979
You like the title?

25:18.992 --> 25:20.949
John, l gotta go.
l'll see you later, okay?

25:21.496 --> 25:23.323
Andrea.

25:35.764 --> 25:37.591
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:38.351 --> 25:41.436
Andrea, look, before you say a word,
l'm not writing anything for the paper.

25:41.605 --> 25:44.393
l know, Brandon told me,
loud and clear.

25:44.609 --> 25:47.527
There's a fine line
between informative and sleazy.

25:47.697 --> 25:50.817
And exactly where is that line, Kelly?

25:51.619 --> 25:53.410
Well, you know what they say:

25:53.580 --> 25:56.250
l can't tell you,
but l'll know when l see it.

25:56.792 --> 25:58.832
See you.

26:01.423 --> 26:02.965
Don't let her bother you.

26:03.176 --> 26:06.380
l'm still writing my piece,
and it is not going to be sleazy.

26:07.473 --> 26:09.845
l'm sure it'll be fine.

26:10.018 --> 26:12.556
There's just a lot going on,
and l'll be glad when it's over.

26:12.772 --> 26:15.346
Well, the vote's tonight.

26:15.525 --> 26:17.850
We'll celebrate afterwards.

26:18.237 --> 26:21.357
Okay. Thanks.

26:25.205 --> 26:28.242
Avoiding anyone in particular?

26:28.542 --> 26:31.543
Excuse me, l don't wanna get in
anyone's face and alienate them.

26:31.713 --> 26:34.917
- Come on, Andrea, hold on a second.
- No, it's late, l gotta go.

26:35.093 --> 26:40.634
Look, l don't want you to think
l don't respect what you've been doing.

26:40.809 --> 26:42.849
lt's hard to be outspoken.
l respect that.

26:43.020 --> 26:44.431
That's not what you said yesterday.

26:44.605 --> 26:48.224
Well, there were a lot of things
l said yesterday l'd like to take back.

26:50.446 --> 26:53.282
l also have to tell you, l can't make it
to the board meeting tonight.

26:53.450 --> 26:54.992
l gotta work.

26:55.161 --> 26:56.739
But l wanna wish you
the best of luck.

26:56.913 --> 26:59.155
You worked hard for this.

27:00.334 --> 27:02.825
Feel free to jump in any time.

27:03.380 --> 27:05.254
l don't have much to say for once.

27:07.886 --> 27:12.632
Well, listen,
about yesterday, l'm sorry.

27:12.809 --> 27:15.265
l didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

27:15.896 --> 27:20.358
You know, it was bad enough being
reminded how inexperienced l am,

27:20.861 --> 27:25.440
but hearing you apologise for it,
it's even worse.

27:30.207 --> 27:33.577
Singleton? Nay.

27:35.172 --> 27:36.963
Beale?

27:39.135 --> 27:40.843
Nay.

27:41.013 --> 27:42.388
That's two nays.

27:42.557 --> 27:45.013
lt's okay. l think the rest are with us.

27:45.185 --> 27:46.679
Sporkin?

27:47.229 --> 27:49.056
Yes.

27:50.859 --> 27:53.529
- Pula?
- Yes.

27:54.114 --> 27:58.113
Next one's Manners.
She seconded the motion. We're in.

27:59.454 --> 28:01.245
Manners?

28:10.427 --> 28:12.301
Nay.

28:22.776 --> 28:25.018
The vote had nothing to do
with the issues.

28:25.238 --> 28:28.192
Sheila Manners and Donna's mom
are best friends.

28:28.409 --> 28:30.069
She really believed
what she was saying,

28:30.245 --> 28:32.534
that handing out condoms
could encourage casual sex.

28:32.706 --> 28:35.791
Which is like saying seat belts
might encourage people to drive cars.

28:35.960 --> 28:37.158
Don't worry, if we need them,

28:37.337 --> 28:39.709
we can always get some seat belts
from David Silver.

28:39.924 --> 28:41.833
This all makes me so depressed.

28:42.010 --> 28:44.466
What good does that do?
l mean, we can't just roll over

28:44.638 --> 28:46.465
and play dead
because of one measly vote.

28:46.641 --> 28:48.468
Donna's right.
We should set up a picket line

28:48.644 --> 28:50.720
in front of the board of education.

28:50.897 --> 28:53.851
No. You know your uncle
the psychologist?

28:54.026 --> 28:55.354
We should help his group pass out

28:55.528 --> 28:57.437
those informational packets
on safer sex.

28:57.656 --> 28:58.854
Yeah, l'd do that in a minute.

28:59.032 --> 29:01.606
Maybe that's something that Dylan
might wanna be involved with.

29:01.786 --> 29:03.494
l bet a lot of people
would wanna do that.

29:03.664 --> 29:05.491
And l bet we could get
the media to cover it.

29:05.666 --> 29:07.742
What do you think, chief?

29:07.961 --> 29:09.455
l don't know.

29:09.630 --> 29:12.121
Why don't you guys
coordinate it with John?

29:12.300 --> 29:13.842
l'll see you later.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.500
She's taking this hard.

29:16.722 --> 29:18.715
What do you expect?
She felt it was important.

29:18.934 --> 29:22.386
No, what she felt was important was
having a forum to discuss the issues.

29:22.605 --> 29:24.265
Now, just because
there's no vote pending

29:24.441 --> 29:27.015
doesn't mean that we have to stop
making ourselves be heard

29:27.195 --> 29:30.280
in a mature and dignified way.

29:30.491 --> 29:33.029
So, what kind of lD do you need
to rent a hotel room?

29:34.287 --> 29:36.078
A hotel room?

29:36.248 --> 29:39.949
Well, l mean, you can't just seduce
a girl in her own car, can you?

29:40.128 --> 29:42.002
David, do l look like Ann Landers?

29:42.173 --> 29:44.711
No, more like Dr. Ruth.

29:44.968 --> 29:47.175
Look, the reason l'm asking you
about the hotel room is

29:47.346 --> 29:52.472
Donna told me that you and Brenda
rented one at the prom last year.

29:53.312 --> 29:55.601
She told you that?

29:56.441 --> 30:01.353
lt was a small detail
that'll never, ever pass these lips.

30:01.865 --> 30:04.356
Why, look, l forgot about it already.

30:04.536 --> 30:06.529
lt's a good thing.

30:06.830 --> 30:08.075
Hobson, l'm bailing.

30:08.290 --> 30:10.960
All right, man, say hi to my family.

30:14.340 --> 30:17.294
- Honey, it's Dylan.
- Send him up.

30:25.355 --> 30:27.312
What you doing?

30:27.691 --> 30:29.731
Waiting for you.

30:31.738 --> 30:34.229
Does that mean
that you're actually ready to go?

30:34.408 --> 30:38.572
Of course not. lt just means
that now it's your turn to wait for me.

30:45.965 --> 30:47.958
What's this, Bren?

30:48.635 --> 30:52.680
Oh, it's for the Blaze,
the special edition.

30:52.849 --> 30:54.723
Like hell it is.

30:54.894 --> 30:58.014
''As often as you read about girls
who become pregnant unintentionally,

30:58.190 --> 31:00.313
you cannot imagine the feelings
until you believe

31:00.484 --> 31:02.109
you are in the situation yourself.''

31:02.320 --> 31:05.108
- You were gonna print that?
- l am going to print it.

31:05.324 --> 31:06.522
l don't kiss and tell.

31:06.701 --> 31:09.868
l don't talk about my conquests
in the locker room.

31:10.790 --> 31:12.617
Dylan, l know you don't.

31:12.792 --> 31:16.244
Look, l'm not saying anything
that's untrue or even embarrassing.

31:16.464 --> 31:17.792
No, it's not embarrassing,

31:17.966 --> 31:20.802
but it's very personal to me,
and you are not gonna print it.

31:21.011 --> 31:22.636
Dylan, come on, l can just redo it.

31:22.805 --> 31:24.632
lt's not as if l don't remember
what l wrote.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.641
l wish you'd forget it.

31:26.811 --> 31:28.851
Dylan, wait a second.
Are you leaving?

31:29.022 --> 31:30.481
Are you gonna go ahead with this?

31:31.233 --> 31:33.309
- Dylan...
- Good night, Bren.

31:33.528 --> 31:34.939
Dylan, wait.

31:35.823 --> 31:36.938
Dylan, wait.

31:37.116 --> 31:39.239
Dylan.

31:40.746 --> 31:43.154
Dylan, please come inside.

31:46.003 --> 31:47.830
Look, l'm not gonna try
and change your mind

31:48.005 --> 31:50.045
if it means that much to you.

31:50.968 --> 31:53.506
Tell me why you're so upset.

31:57.184 --> 31:58.975
l can't believe you.

31:59.187 --> 32:03.351
Dylan, l was only writing that piece
because l think there's a need for it.

32:04.527 --> 32:07.861
l was scared to death
when l thought l was pregnant.

32:08.574 --> 32:10.614
lt would have helped me so much
to have known that

32:10.785 --> 32:14.404
there was someone else out there
our age who'd been through it.

32:14.582 --> 32:17.204
You wrote about something
very personal that l was involved in

32:17.377 --> 32:21.506
for the whole school to read.
You didn't even ask me how l felt.

32:22.342 --> 32:25.094
l'm sorry. l didn't see it that way.

32:25.304 --> 32:26.964
You have good intentions, Bren,

32:27.140 --> 32:30.474
but right now l need to keep
my private life very, very private.

32:30.645 --> 32:31.973
l thought you knew that.

32:32.189 --> 32:35.808
Dylan, l was writing about me,
about my feelings.

32:36.653 --> 32:39.690
They're gonna know
who the guy is, Bren.

32:39.865 --> 32:43.032
How many boyfriends
have you had at West Beverly?

32:44.079 --> 32:45.787
One.

32:47.125 --> 32:49.034
And l'd like to keep it that way.

32:51.965 --> 32:53.708
Why don't you come back inside?

33:10.739 --> 33:12.566
Smells good.

33:13.159 --> 33:17.407
- ls that the perfume l gave you?
- Maybe. Maybe not.

33:17.582 --> 33:19.789
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Silver.

33:19.960 --> 33:22.249
l'm gonna go talk to Andrea.

33:22.421 --> 33:24.330
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

33:24.508 --> 33:26.999
Look, thanks for
the advice last night, man.

33:27.178 --> 33:28.672
What advice?

33:28.847 --> 33:33.724
Well, it wasn't so much what you said,
it was the way you didn't say it.

33:34.896 --> 33:37.732
See, it really got me thinking.
lt's all a question of timing.

33:37.900 --> 33:40.225
Like the song said,
you can't hurry love.

33:40.403 --> 33:44.318
So we just gotta hang tight and wait
for the right moment to come along.

33:44.492 --> 33:46.615
Or until l get my licence.

33:46.787 --> 33:48.863
Hi. Great news.

33:49.040 --> 33:52.244
My parents left for Aspen, so we can
watch the MTV special at my house.

33:53.880 --> 33:56.502
Hi, Dylan. Bye, Dylan.

33:57.050 --> 33:58.509
Bye, Donna.

34:01.556 --> 34:03.134
Timing's everything.

34:05.228 --> 34:08.181
Now, remember, this topic
can make people very nervous,

34:08.357 --> 34:11.275
so after the show, don't be pushy
if someone's not interested.

34:11.444 --> 34:14.648
l think that's probably
pretty obvious, John.

34:16.326 --> 34:19.244
Andrea, l'm really sorry,

34:19.413 --> 34:22.034
but l decided not to do my piece
on the pregnancy scare.

34:22.833 --> 34:25.788
l hope it doesn't goof up
your special edition too much.

34:25.964 --> 34:28.371
No, it's okay. l understand.

34:29.342 --> 34:31.170
Look, Dylan just
didn't want me to and--

34:31.346 --> 34:33.884
Look, you don't need to explain,
Brenda, okay?

34:34.099 --> 34:37.350
l mean, l'm not even sure
that l'm going through with it anymore.

34:37.520 --> 34:40.391
Okay, now, does anyone
have any questions about this stuff?

34:40.565 --> 34:42.274
- Anything?
- l can't do this.

34:42.860 --> 34:44.272
l can't walk up to a total stranger

34:44.446 --> 34:46.438
and hand him
an information packet about sex.

34:46.657 --> 34:49.574
Come on, Kelly, it's a public service.
lt's a good deed.

34:50.161 --> 34:52.119
Doesn't anyone
wanna go shopping instead?

34:52.331 --> 34:54.491
- Kelly.
- What? That's a good deed.

34:54.668 --> 34:55.947
lt's helping the economy.

34:56.128 --> 34:58.453
Look, why don't we stick
to AlDS education today

34:58.673 --> 35:01.343
and retail tomorrow, okay?

35:02.178 --> 35:05.132
Sorry, guys. Count me out.

35:07.185 --> 35:10.389
Well, Dylan, glad you could make it.
Here's a little light reading for you.

35:10.564 --> 35:13.316
All right, guys,
let's get on with it, huh?

35:14.277 --> 35:17.231
l thought there'd be
some dirty pictures in there.

35:21.161 --> 35:24.578
All right, who wants the box?
Good man.

35:24.749 --> 35:26.789
After you.

35:27.169 --> 35:29.328
You go ahead with Brandon,
l'll meet you guys later.

35:29.506 --> 35:31.380
No, l'll wait for you.

35:31.926 --> 35:34.548
l don't know if l'm gonna go.

35:34.763 --> 35:36.388
l'm not feeling that well.

35:37.308 --> 35:39.550
Do you need me to take you
to the nurse or something?

35:40.270 --> 35:41.468
John...

35:41.647 --> 35:45.646
John, just go, okay? l'll be fine.

35:55.874 --> 35:57.333
You're not coming, are you?

35:59.086 --> 36:01.624
Well, you and John
can handle this fine without me.

36:03.008 --> 36:04.336
Come on, Andrea,
step on my foot,

36:04.510 --> 36:07.880
give me a face rake, an eye gouge,
something, l don't know,

36:08.056 --> 36:09.847
just stop making me feel
so guilty, okay?

36:11.144 --> 36:14.264
Brandon, let me just clarify
something for you.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.480
l'm the one whose feelings
were hurt here.

36:18.737 --> 36:23.199
So l'm the hurter
and you're the hurtee, is that it?

36:25.329 --> 36:27.037
Exactly.

36:28.125 --> 36:29.952
You sure you don't wanna come?

36:30.127 --> 36:33.710
Yeah. l'm tired
and a little burned out,

36:33.882 --> 36:38.046
and if l never hear the word
''condom'' again, it will be too soon.

36:38.597 --> 36:40.222
We could always
just use sign language.

36:40.433 --> 36:42.640
Or not and say we did.

36:43.520 --> 36:45.809
Go ahead, they're waiting for you.

36:45.981 --> 36:47.689
Okay.

36:49.736 --> 36:50.981
l'm sorry.

36:52.198 --> 36:55.318
Yeah. See you.

37:06.634 --> 37:09.172
l keep leaving my chemistry book
everywhere l go.

37:09.346 --> 37:12.347
l think my subconscious
is trying to tell me something.

37:15.228 --> 37:19.357
Andrea, what's the matter?
Why didn't you go with them?

37:20.026 --> 37:22.066
l couldn't be that much
of a hypocrite.

37:22.238 --> 37:24.195
l mean, who am l to
try to educate people

37:24.365 --> 37:27.283
about safer sex when l've never...?

37:28.663 --> 37:30.620
You're probably much better off.

37:31.834 --> 37:35.619
Easy for you to say.
You could have any guy you want.

37:37.132 --> 37:39.339
No, l can't.

37:40.971 --> 37:45.800
Name one guy you ever wanted
who turned you down.

37:48.063 --> 37:50.056
Brandon Walsh.

37:53.404 --> 37:55.942
- Brandon?
- Yeah.

37:56.116 --> 37:57.907
Last year at the spring dance,

37:58.077 --> 38:01.078
he told me he thinks of me
like a sister.

38:07.005 --> 38:08.962
You're still really stuck on him,
aren't you?

38:11.094 --> 38:12.754
Yes.

38:13.222 --> 38:15.298
Why is that?

38:16.768 --> 38:20.220
Because we always want
what we can't have.

38:23.193 --> 38:27.405
Well, at least you've had something.

38:28.825 --> 38:30.485
Andrea, wait just a second.

38:33.206 --> 38:36.540
When l was a freshman,
l threw myself at a senior,

38:36.711 --> 38:39.665
who pushed me into a bush
and never talked to me again.

38:41.926 --> 38:43.088
For the next year and a half,

38:43.261 --> 38:46.761
l spent all my time trying
to live up to that reputation.

38:46.933 --> 38:49.389
And now, even though l've changed,

38:49.561 --> 38:53.310
l never know whether a guy
asks me out because he likes me

38:53.483 --> 38:55.891
or because he thinks l'm easy.

38:59.241 --> 39:00.984
l'm sorry, that's terrible.

39:04.039 --> 39:07.243
So don't sit here
feeling sorry for yourself.

39:08.252 --> 39:11.669
You're not missing out on anything
you can't do later on.

39:12.216 --> 39:14.007
Me?

39:14.469 --> 39:16.509
l can never go back.

39:22.146 --> 39:25.100
Too bad we just can't meet
in the middle.

39:26.860 --> 39:28.769
l think we already have.

39:38.250 --> 39:39.828
John.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.248
So okay?

39:41.421 --> 39:42.832
John, what are you doing here?

39:43.007 --> 39:46.542
- l decided not to go.
- Why?

39:46.720 --> 39:51.098
Well, l've gone on these field trips
with my uncle and the group before

39:51.309 --> 39:53.979
and, l don't know,
l wasn't up for it today.

39:54.146 --> 39:56.684
l guess l just don't feel like
part of the gang.

39:57.818 --> 40:01.769
- ls it Brandon?
- No, l like Brandon, everybody does.

40:01.948 --> 40:06.445
lt's just the little comments here
and there, the in-jokes.

40:07.414 --> 40:11.744
Without you, l guess l just feel like
an outsider, you know?

40:12.921 --> 40:14.795
l sure do.

40:15.049 --> 40:17.374
lt's like what l wrote in that essay:

40:17.552 --> 40:18.927
''Just because you have four hooves

40:19.096 --> 40:20.887
doesn't mean you have to
follow the herd.''

40:21.432 --> 40:24.184
- What essay was that?
- The one you didn't wanna read.

40:24.770 --> 40:27.855
ls that the one about feeling
like the last virgin on earth?

40:28.358 --> 40:29.769
Yeah.

40:30.361 --> 40:33.778
- You wrote that?
- Yeah.

40:37.662 --> 40:43.417
Look, if l were to go to West Hollywood
to be with the others,

40:44.171 --> 40:46.164
would you go with me?

40:46.424 --> 40:48.298
Well, sure.

40:49.886 --> 40:55.558
And if l wanted to go
to the movies afterwards,

40:56.061 --> 40:57.555
would you take me?

40:58.147 --> 41:00.056
l thought you'd never ask.

41:08.161 --> 41:10.533
- Who's hungry?
- Me.

41:10.706 --> 41:13.280
Okay, extra large,
half pepperoni, half cheese.

41:13.459 --> 41:15.784
Oh, great.

41:15.962 --> 41:18.169
- How much do l owe you?
- l got it.

41:18.341 --> 41:19.621
No, come on.

41:19.843 --> 41:21.752
No, you can get it next time.

41:21.970 --> 41:24.971
Okay, fine. Thanks.

41:33.903 --> 41:35.183
What's this?

41:36.823 --> 41:39.231
l have other kinds
if you don't like that one.

41:39.452 --> 41:41.659
Oh, you're such a kidder.

41:47.713 --> 41:49.338
David.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.796
You want one piece or two?

41:53.387 --> 41:56.887
Maybe we should work up
an appetite first.

42:01.606 --> 42:05.651
Wait. l'm beginning to think
you weren't kidding about...

42:05.862 --> 42:06.893
Why would l be kidding?

42:07.072 --> 42:10.940
lt's like you said, if you're in the pool,
you gotta swim.

42:11.703 --> 42:15.488
Wait a second.
l'm over here on the chaise lounge.

42:16.793 --> 42:18.584
What?

42:21.299 --> 42:23.837
l don't intend to sleep with you.

42:29.226 --> 42:30.851
Oh, it's too soon.

42:31.061 --> 42:33.897
- l can see that.
- No.

42:34.107 --> 42:37.192
l'm not gonna do that with anybody.

42:39.281 --> 42:40.775
You mean ever?

42:41.659 --> 42:42.987
Well, with my husband, of course.

42:43.161 --> 42:45.320
l'm not entering a convent
or anything, for God's sake.

42:45.789 --> 42:48.459
Wait, what about all that stuff
you said at the parents' meeting?

42:48.668 --> 42:50.577
l just don't want kids
to get sick or worse

42:50.754 --> 42:52.961
because their parents
have their heads in the sand.

42:53.132 --> 42:55.968
l mean, AlDS is not the only
sexually transmitted disease.

42:56.136 --> 42:59.553
- There's lots of others. For instance--
- l know, l know.

42:59.724 --> 43:02.180
Look, l don't have
any of those, l swear.

43:02.394 --> 43:04.601
l know, l believe you.

43:04.773 --> 43:09.270
lt's just, right now, for me,
life is complicated enough

43:09.445 --> 43:13.146
without getting involved
in a sexual relationship.

43:17.957 --> 43:21.457
So l guess driving to Vegas
is out of the question.

43:24.674 --> 43:26.168
l hope you're not too upset.

43:27.386 --> 43:28.761
No, l'm not, really.

43:28.929 --> 43:32.762
l'm actually kind of relieved.

43:36.398 --> 43:40.266
So, what'll it be?
Pepperoni or cheese?

43:42.072 --> 43:45.572
Pepperoni, definitely.

43:47.454 --> 43:49.162
That's what l said.

43:49.331 --> 43:51.288
Oh, Bren, l gotta go,
my mom just walked in.

43:51.459 --> 43:53.618
Okay, bye.

43:53.796 --> 43:56.963
Hey, you. What'd you
wanna talk to me about?

43:57.133 --> 43:59.422
Kelly, l want you to promise me

43:59.595 --> 44:01.718
that you will never,
ever have unprotected sex.

44:01.890 --> 44:03.088
Not even once.

44:03.475 --> 44:05.764
What are you talking about?
What is the matter?

44:08.649 --> 44:10.440
l'm pregnant.
