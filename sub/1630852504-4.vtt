into business together, and then

09:17.457 --> 09:20.191
He tells me that I don't have
a head for numbers?!

09:20.327 --> 09:23.361
Haha! Oh! And he also gave me
herpes one time. Can you arrest

09:23.496 --> 09:25.597
Him for that?
- I have no idea.

09:25.599 --> 09:29.333
I'm gonna look into that though.
So you have no idea where he is?
- No.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.736
- Ok, what about his brothers?
Stef bowen? Any of his friends?

09:31.738 --> 09:34.271
- Loser only has one friend,
the rest of those guys are
just minions.

09:34.308 --> 09:36.307
- Ok, who's the one friend?
- Hmm...

09:36.310 --> 09:40.144
Mateo something.
I don't know his last name.
He's a tow-truck driver.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.313
- Ok.
- He and randy always
have each other's backs.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.883
You know, bro code,
all that stuff.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.885
- Uh... Ok, this is great.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.552
I'm gonna look into that.
Thank you so much!

09:48.589 --> 09:50.088
- Ok, great!
- Ok, great!

09:50.157 --> 09:51.623
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.224
- Ana? Sorry. I just...

09:54.695 --> 09:57.562
Uh, here. Um... I just feel
like I need to tell you:

09:57.697 --> 09:59.564
You can't get the herpes virus
just like one time.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.300
- Oh, well, what can I say?
I did.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.735
- Yeah, but if you get it
one time, you're more
than likely to...

10:06.006 --> 10:08.306
Thank you so much
for coming in.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.841
- Ok.
- Ok.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.846
Ok. Mateo dominguez

10:14.915 --> 10:16.847
Manages t&r towing
over on brookline.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.917
Right beside
that awesome feather factory.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.986
- What are you talking about?
- Uh, they sell duvets for $49;

10:22.055 --> 10:23.788
That's like
the best deal in town.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.191
Also, mateo doesn't have
a record, which is probably why

10:26.193 --> 10:28.593
He wasn't on our radar.
- And this is interesting
because?

10:28.728 --> 10:31.329
- Because according to randy's
ex, mateo's tight with randy.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.398
He owns a bentley, a boat,
a big house in the bluffs.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.533
What? All on a tow-truck
driver's salary?

10:35.569 --> 10:37.868
- So you're thinking mateo's
dealing for randy at the
tow-truck office?

10:37.904 --> 10:39.937
- Yes, I am. I mean, the fact
that he has eluded us

10:39.973 --> 10:42.006
This far means
he is super smart.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.675
Big catch, possibly
like a big fish,

10:43.744 --> 10:45.543
Like a sunfish or a sturgeon,
maybe the whales.

10:45.545 --> 10:48.146
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
The fact that mateo doesn't have

10:48.215 --> 10:49.814
A record makes him
vulnerable to us.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.616
We hit him with a decent charge,
he will be desperate to turn on

10:52.653 --> 10:54.618
Randy. He's gonna tell us where
he's hiding and make us a deal.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.955
- So what charges do you plan
on getting him on?

10:56.957 --> 10:59.023
- This is where
you could help me out.

10:59.059 --> 11:02.027
If you just arranged for him
to sell you, like, 8 to 9 kilos,

11:02.162 --> 11:03.695
We could get him
for trafficking.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.830
That, my friend,
is like 10 to life.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.565
- Oh, ok. Just like that?

11:07.634 --> 11:09.768
- Mm-hmm.
- Hate to break it
to you, wazowski,

11:09.770 --> 11:11.702
But it doesn't work that way.
You just can't moonwalk in

11:11.738 --> 11:13.371
And expect to make
that kind of buy.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.206
- Yeah, you know what?
You're right.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.042
We need a shortcut in, someone
to make the introductions,

11:17.177 --> 11:20.178
Someone connected to the bowens
and someone who mateo trusts.

Pulled a few strings

road trip, so I don't mind.

As we would love to banter
with you, we don't have time.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.128
We need you to set up a buy.
- Why would I do that?

11:37.164 --> 11:39.630
- To be an outstanding citizen
and make your mother
proud for once.

11:39.666 --> 11:42.267
- Ok. I never really
cared what mom thought
if you want the truth.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.934

- What do you want?

11:43.970 --> 11:46.471
What do you want?

11:46.473 --> 11:50.608
Well, I'm not loving jail.
Me and my friend here,

11:50.744 --> 11:52.477
We could use
some conjugal visits, you know.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.712
- Yeah, right.
- Your "friend"?

11:54.847 --> 11:56.747
Ok, fine... Fine.

- Hey. You hear from
your brothers lately?

12:10.163 --> 12:12.997
'cause randy and stef don't seem
too concerned about you

12:12.999 --> 12:15.934
Rotting away in the clink.

I'm not giving him a cut

backup, you're taking naz.

one, like, bit of minutiae

14:37.477 --> 14:38.976
Nimble. Of course,
all that stuff.

14:39.045 --> 14:42.180
But if you were gonna plan
what you were gonna say,

14:42.315 --> 14:44.249
I was just wondering,
what would it sound like?

14:46.052 --> 14:47.818
- Why did you
invite him there?

14:47.888 --> 14:49.187
- [because, lay, I need him
to trust me.]

14:49.322 --> 14:51.956
Stef bowen can't trust me
if I don't trust him.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.591
- [yeah, but you don't
trust him]

14:53.660 --> 14:55.727
Because everyone who knows him
says he's crazy. Even randy.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.428
- [hang on.]
(knocking)

14:57.497 --> 14:59.663
Wait, baby,
don't get that. Ugh!

14:59.699 --> 15:03.134
The guy's early,
who does that?

15:03.203 --> 15:06.004
- Rick's little boy!
Getting big, huh?

15:06.006 --> 15:07.739
You want to fight?
- Not really.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.773
- Stef, you are early.

How much are you planning
on swindling out of me

15:38.605 --> 15:41.372
For some fake tip
about my brother?
- I don't want your money.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.374
I want to get
into business with you.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.810
(chuckling)
it's not that funny.

15:45.879 --> 15:48.947
Rick already connected me
to bill misiano in buffalo,

15:49.082 --> 15:51.449
And I'll be bringing the drugs
across the border myself.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.651
I'd like you to keep
distribution going here.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.120
Status quo.
You can cut randy out

15:56.122 --> 15:57.521
Or loop him in; I don't care,
that's your business.

15:57.557 --> 16:01.526
- Sorry. My mind
wandered for a minute.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.594
Did you say that
rick connected you with misiano?

16:05.065 --> 16:07.598
- I did.
- And where's my brother?

16:07.600 --> 16:09.333
- We have him,

16:09.402 --> 16:12.804
Ready to hand him over.
You just need to say the word.

16:15.175 --> 16:18.743
- You know, people bug me.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.344
Probably more than they should.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.614
I mean, I'm a person,
you'd think I'd like people,

16:23.750 --> 16:25.616
At least some,
at least a little, but I don't.

16:25.618 --> 16:29.486
So I tell you what,
we can do business

16:29.522 --> 16:31.322
If you take care
of one of those people for me.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.591
- What do you mean?
- Take my brother out,

16:33.726 --> 16:35.693
Get rid of him.
He ripped me off,

16:35.762 --> 16:37.428
He pissed me off,
and now I gotta come up

16:37.464 --> 16:40.698
With a few hundred thousand
dollars that he lost.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.433
Oops! 'cause he's an idiot!

16:42.469 --> 16:44.302
But he's my brother,

16:44.304 --> 16:46.370
So if I see him,
I'll forgive him.

16:48.108 --> 16:51.042
So if you want to work with me,
take out randy.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.378
If you got the stones
for that, we'll talk.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.913
If you don't, we won't.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.951
What's the matter?

16:59.953 --> 17:01.919
Oh, look at you.

17:01.921 --> 17:04.321
Poor single mommy wanted to play
with the big boys,

17:04.357 --> 17:06.924
And now you gotta
kill somebody.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.993
Get somebody else to do it.
I don't care, just get it done.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.871

Hello, hot tip.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.873
Hell hath no fury

17:22.008 --> 17:23.407

that again.

17:23.443 --> 17:26.144
(man clearing his throat)
listen. Speaking of which,

17:26.279 --> 17:29.747
I think you and I should have
a talk about the ds promotion.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.416
Now, in all sincerity,
I want you to know

17:32.452 --> 17:34.485
That nothing's gonna change
when I'm your boss.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.620
- Ok, great. I want you to know
that everything will change

17:36.656 --> 17:39.824
When I'm your boss.
(man laughing)

17:39.826 --> 17:41.625
You actually think
you have a chance.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.294
- You know what I do have?
More commendations

17:43.363 --> 17:46.096
And a high-profile arrest
under my belt. Now, you may

17:46.132 --> 17:48.132
Remember the saints.
- Oh, I do remember the saints,

17:48.201 --> 17:49.901
Yeah. Um, you might
want to remember

17:50.036 --> 17:52.904
That I have testicles.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.771
Still a man's world, sammy.

17:54.808 --> 17:57.641
- Yeah. Why don't you tell that
to our female commander, hammy.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.710
- Ooh, hammy.
- You know what?

17:59.846 --> 18:01.245
I'm gonna remember
your sexist attitude

18:01.380 --> 18:03.481

his middle name?

I know rafi.

This is his deal, and
you are the middle man.
And I don't like you.

You either give me
stef bowen's phone number

28:31.510 --> 28:33.510
Or you're going away
for the next 10 years.

28:35.013 --> 28:37.114
- Are you serious?
- Like a heart attack.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.752
- I gotta say...

28:41.754 --> 28:43.554
I'm kind of relieved!

28:43.689 --> 28:45.889
Did you know
they have farms

28:46.024 --> 28:49.092
In prisons? You can raise
little ducks. Little ones!

28:49.161 --> 28:51.361
I was in way too deep

28:51.397 --> 28:53.297
With those guys,
and I started thinking

28:53.432 --> 28:55.365
About my mom having to go
to my funeral.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.834
- Listen.
- There's little ones.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.772
- Did your mom know that
you're in the game?
- Are you kidding?

29:01.774 --> 29:04.108
No.
- No?
(both chuckling)

29:04.243 --> 29:07.177
So how do you think she's gonna
feel when she finds out

29:07.213 --> 29:10.314
That not only are you in
the game, but you didn't
cooperate with police,

29:10.449 --> 29:13.383
And now she has
to drive three hours

29:13.385 --> 29:16.253
Every second weekend to come
visit you and your ducks?

29:16.255 --> 29:18.589
How do you think
that's gonna make her feel?

29:18.591 --> 29:20.456
Hmm?

29:20.493 --> 29:23.993
We can knock down the charges.
We can protect you from stef.

29:26.031 --> 29:29.365
All we need
is stef bowen's number.

29:34.774 --> 29:38.107
He's in my phone
as... Linda.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.745
Don't ask me,
it's a long story.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.348
- Thank you.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.092
(stef sighing)

29:59.899 --> 30:03.300
(whistling a short tune)

30:05.370 --> 30:06.570
(knuckles cracking)

30:10.742 --> 30:12.242
- Ah! Ugh!

30:15.114 --> 30:18.047
Ugh! Ugh!

30:19.118 --> 30:19.983
- Aah!

30:21.220 --> 30:23.053
What now, turd stain?

30:23.122 --> 30:25.955
(screaming and grunting)

30:35.134 --> 30:36.066
Come on!

30:36.201 --> 30:40.103
(grunting)

30:40.239 --> 30:42.372
Aaaaah!

30:43.475 --> 30:45.509
(grunting)

30:45.511 --> 30:48.879
(duff coughing)
- now, who's the turd stain?!

30:48.881 --> 30:52.349
(panting)
- would you believe
it's still you?

30:52.351 --> 30:55.018
You wanna mess up
a perfectly good deal

30:55.153 --> 30:56.753
By what? Robbing me?!

30:56.822 --> 31:00.290
This is serious amateur hour.
- You know what's amateur hour?

31:00.292 --> 31:03.293
It's coming into my territory
and making

31:03.362 --> 31:06.430
Deals behind my back!
- Ah!

31:06.565 --> 31:11.234
- Oops!
- So we didn't include you,
and you felt a little left out?

31:11.237 --> 31:15.038
- 49 guys wanna come here,
they gotta go through me.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.374
I am the gatekeeper
of stockwood,

31:17.376 --> 31:19.776
And all who trespass here
must pay

31:19.845 --> 31:21.644
A toll!
- What?

31:21.680 --> 31:23.914
What kind of gandalf nonsense
are you talking about, huh?

31:23.916 --> 31:26.749
I mean, do you even know
how gates and tolls work?!

31:27.920 --> 31:30.320
(duff panting)

31:30.455 --> 31:33.123
- Oh, I'm glad you never shut
that pretty mouth of yours.

31:33.258 --> 31:35.525
That way when you go back,
you can tell them everything

31:35.527 --> 31:39.996
I did to you exactly. What?
(duff crying)

31:43.068 --> 31:45.002
- I'm sorry, so sorry.

31:45.137 --> 31:48.872
(duff crying)
- come on. What... What is this?

31:48.874 --> 31:50.941
- I didn't work
with anyone from montreal!

31:51.010 --> 31:52.943
I'm sorry.
I've been lying.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.112
I've been lying
to your brother.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.347
And now I'm lying
to you!

31:57.349 --> 31:59.216
I'm not even from here!

32:00.819 --> 32:02.285
I'm from detroit.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.821
I sold my mom's house, so I can
get this money together.

32:04.823 --> 32:08.391
So stupid! I don't know what
I was thinking! I'm so sorry!

32:10.095 --> 32:11.495
See, my brother
just got out of prison,

32:11.630 --> 32:14.364
Right? And... And dealing's
the only thing he knows

32:14.499 --> 32:16.233
How to do now,
so I said I'd help him.

32:16.368 --> 32:19.836
I got six of us, man, and
my mom's living on my couch!

32:19.905 --> 32:23.840
(duff crying)
(stef laughing)

32:23.909 --> 32:27.110
I'm so sorry.
- Oh, women, god love you.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.845
- Right.

32:28.914 --> 32:31.181
Listen, we're just gonna go
over the plan again.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.915
It's really simple.

32:32.952 --> 32:34.584
You're gonna
get stef on the phone.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.720
You're going to tell him
that you scored the cash,

32:36.855 --> 32:38.655
And that you're ready--
- ready to meet him

32:38.790 --> 32:40.857
Where he is.
Yes, I got it, ok?

32:40.926 --> 32:43.393
Stop harping at me, woman!

32:43.429 --> 32:46.262
- Get him talking,
keep him talking

32:46.298 --> 32:48.999
Until he gives you
an address.

32:49.134 --> 32:51.134
Come on.
You can do this.

32:59.277 --> 33:01.411
Yeah, you need to dial, mateo.
- Oh-oh.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.213
- Where did you meet
my brother?

33:03.348 --> 33:05.549
- I met him at a prince concert.

33:05.684 --> 33:08.418
- Sounds realistic.
(cell phone ringing)

33:08.454 --> 33:11.154
Oh... That's nice.

33:11.156 --> 33:14.724
Ugh!
(groaning in pain)

33:16.295 --> 33:18.228
(cell phone ringing)

33:18.363 --> 33:20.430
- Hello!
- [hello?]

33:20.466 --> 33:22.399
Hello?
- [who's this?]

33:22.534 --> 33:24.835
- Oh, my god, it's kelly!
- Can I please speak to stef?

33:24.837 --> 33:27.304
- Give me the phone!
Give me the goddamn phone!

33:27.306 --> 33:29.839
- Ow!
- Duff! Duff, it's me, sam.

33:29.875 --> 33:32.576
[where are you?]
- um, I'm inside
the towing lot headed south.

33:32.711 --> 33:35.512
Just... Stef's a psycho,
I need to get out of here.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.713
- Listen, you need to stay calm.
You keep heading south.

33:37.750 --> 33:39.983
There is a feather factory,
it is on your right.

33:39.985 --> 33:42.452
No security systems, so you can
just kick in the side door

33:42.587 --> 33:44.654
And then find a place to hide.
We'll be right there.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.589
- We got the warrant; we're
tracking his phone right now.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.191
- Kelly, we're tracking your
phone. You need to leave
that phone on.

33:48.193 --> 33:50.860
[do you understand me?
Leave that phone on.]

33:50.896 --> 33:53.396
[stay calm.]
- I'm not feeling super calm

33:53.399 --> 33:55.665
Right now.
- [I got you.]

33:55.667 --> 33:57.333
I promise.
- He's heading
west on brookline.

33:57.403 --> 33:59.235
Looks like he's on foot.
You two, come with me!

34:00.739 --> 34:02.605
- ♪ tell me

34:02.641 --> 34:05.408

That wasn't very polite.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.043
Was it?

34:40.112 --> 34:42.745
You hurt my feelings.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.825
(cell phone ringing)
- ouch! No, no, no. No.

34:55.894 --> 34:58.862
(cell phone still ringing)

35:00.899 --> 35:03.400
- Ah... Shhh...
(cell phone stops ringing)

35:03.402 --> 35:06.235
- Like leaving breadcrumbs
to the gingerbread house.

35:07.372 --> 35:09.405
(three gunshots)

35:11.977 --> 35:14.277
- What if I said I was a cop?!

35:14.279 --> 35:16.146
- I would say I'm sick
of your stories.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.582
- What if I said,
trust me, I'm a cop?!

35:18.584 --> 35:20.116
(three gunshots)

35:20.251 --> 35:21.818
- I don't trust my own mother.

35:21.820 --> 35:25.555
(sirens wailing)

35:25.690 --> 35:27.423
Ok, now I trust you.
- Police!

35:27.493 --> 35:30.960
- Hands in the air!
- Put the gun down now!

35:31.029 --> 35:32.962
- Put your weapon down!
- Let's see those hands!

35:32.998 --> 35:36.566
- Put your hands in the air!
- Oh, my god!

35:36.635 --> 35:39.836
- Ooh! Easy, big boy.
- Kelly?

35:41.573 --> 35:43.339
(indistinct police radio)
duff?

35:45.944 --> 35:47.843
You ok?

35:49.915 --> 35:50.980
- Never been better.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.119
Thank you. Thank you.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.864
- Good night.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.066
- You know
it's almost 10 o'clock?

36:10.202 --> 36:12.402
- It's business,
I won't be late.
- You better not be

36:12.537 --> 36:15.071
Or I'm gonna pack 'em up,
and I'm gonna move 'em
over to my place.

36:15.073 --> 36:17.073
- You're not taking my boys.
- Listen, I've been saying
that we need

36:17.075 --> 36:18.741
To get that boy
out of this neighbourhood.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.410
Cops coming in here

36:20.479 --> 36:22.479
Arresting innocent people--
- oh yeah,

36:22.481 --> 36:24.614
Like your son?
- If rick made a mistake,

36:24.683 --> 36:26.749
It was not getting
out of stockwood sooner.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.918
- Ok.
- I heard stef bowen

36:28.921 --> 36:32.188
Got picked up tonight.
- Stef bowen got arrested?

36:32.323 --> 36:34.491
- Mm-hmm. Couple of hours ago
according to his mama.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.359
But it don't
change nothing.

36:36.428 --> 36:38.962
It's only a matter of time
before someone else starts...

36:38.964 --> 36:40.896
- Good night, maureen.
- ...Bringing the drugs
back in here!

36:40.933 --> 36:43.366
<i> - I should have stuck</i>
<i> to my plan. I mean,</i>

36:43.402 --> 36:45.635
I should have pulled you out of
there as soon as stef walked in.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.903
- Shoulda, coulda, woulda.
I told you

36:47.940 --> 36:49.506
I want to play it loose.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.440
It's not on you.
- I just like to

36:51.476 --> 36:53.209
Think that I'm better at taking
care of my team, you know.

36:53.344 --> 36:56.146
- Could, woulda, shoulda,
wazowski, alright? Stop it.

36:56.281 --> 36:58.248
- I'm just saying I'm sorry.

36:58.250 --> 37:00.183
(duff sighing)

37:00.318 --> 37:03.452
- The reason I keep roasting you
about that promotion...

37:05.791 --> 37:09.192
...Is because I don't want you
to get that promotion.

37:09.327 --> 37:11.160
You belong on a street team.

37:13.165 --> 37:14.930
You're always
thinking ahead,

37:14.967 --> 37:16.832
Planning, pivoting.

37:20.038 --> 37:21.471
- Haha!

37:21.606 --> 37:23.205
(duff sighing)

37:25.677 --> 37:28.478
- I was out there
in that towing lot...

37:31.016 --> 37:33.550
...Not sure how I was
gonna make it out alive,

37:33.552 --> 37:35.217
And then you called
with this lame-ass plan.

37:36.355 --> 37:39.221
And I'm like,
"you know what?

37:42.160 --> 37:44.694
I'm gonna trust her.
She's got my back."

37:48.367 --> 37:50.033
I don't want you
at a desk.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.772
But I'm sure
if you get there,

37:55.841 --> 37:59.042
You'll rock that too.
- Are you sure

37:59.044 --> 38:00.577
You're ok?

38:00.579 --> 38:02.112
- Yeah.

38:02.247 --> 38:04.514
- You wouldn't tell me
if you weren't.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.516
- Nope.

38:08.253 --> 38:10.520
(rock music playing)
- what's the occasion?

38:10.522 --> 38:11.988
- Nothing.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.324
Just that you could use a drink.
It's Friday, right?

38:16.928 --> 38:17.860
- Sure.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.801
(song<i> mountain</i> by crown lands)
you wanna touch her?

38:27.439 --> 38:28.838
You do.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.940
Here.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.475
- Ah!

38:35.480 --> 38:38.614
Wow! Thought she'd be
slimy or something?

38:38.616 --> 38:41.217
Does she have teeth?
- Yeah, she got teeth.

38:41.219 --> 38:43.019
She don't bite.

38:43.088 --> 38:46.389
This baby girl here
swallows everything whole.

38:47.893 --> 38:48.824
Tig!

38:48.860 --> 38:50.760
What-what's the point of this?

38:50.796 --> 38:54.164
- I was gonna kill you on behalf
of your charming brother stef.

38:54.299 --> 38:56.766
Lucky you, now I don't have to.

38:56.901 --> 39:00.569
- What are you talking about?
- Stef just got pinched.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.707
He kidnapped a cop,
if you can believe it.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.208
He wanted me to kill you.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.577
- What an asshole.

39:07.646 --> 39:10.046
- Whatever he felt about you,
he was still the only brother

39:10.115 --> 39:13.382
You had left out there.
Now, you really got nothing.

39:13.418 --> 39:15.318
- Oh, don't you worry
about me, tig.

39:15.453 --> 39:18.121
- Cops find you, you're done.
You don't have

39:18.123 --> 39:20.656
Any money or drugs, buffalo guys
won't work with you.

39:20.658 --> 39:24.059
But me, they will
work with me.

39:24.096 --> 39:26.996
I got my trucks,
I got product,

39:26.998 --> 39:29.198
And I got money, so...

39:30.869 --> 39:32.535
...I pretty much run
stockwood now, don't I?

39:34.039 --> 39:36.472
There's one more thing I got.

39:36.508 --> 39:39.275
- Oh yeah, what's that?
- Your balls in a sling.

39:39.277 --> 39:42.344
So, you're gonna be
my muscle or what?

39:42.381 --> 39:45.215
- ♪ fire and brimstone burning ♪

39:45.350 --> 39:47.450
♪ mountain will shine again ♪

39:47.452 --> 39:49.719
