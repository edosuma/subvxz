Here's what happened last week.

00:04.088 --> 00:05.963
Rachel and the Glee Club
know that Quinn's pregnant,

00:06.048 --> 00:08.633
but they all think
Finn's the father,
when really, it's Puck. Yikes.

00:08.717 --> 00:13.429
And Terri's only fake pregnant
and wants Quinn to give her
her baby so Will won't find out.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.139
How come you haven't had
any morning sickness?

00:15.224 --> 00:17.350

but she's really got eyes
for Mr. Schue.

You're sleep-walking

00:32.032 --> 00:33.908
Gimme some energy.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.327
We've got sectionals in two-
Please. Sectionals
is gonna be a breeze.

Maybe so—
- [Yawns]

00:39.331 --> 00:43.084

sectionals, we're gonna get
killed at regionals.

No, no, no, no.
Great news, guys.

Just got the competition
bracket for sectionals,
and we are in really good shape.

01:39.725 --> 01:42.727
There's only two other teams.
If we beat them,
we make it to regionals.

- Who are the other teams?

Drumroll, please, Finn.

That's a halfway house...

I don't know. They think
they've got it in the bag,

02:07.711 --> 02:09.629
so they've simply
stopped trying.

02:09.713 --> 02:12.590
I've got to figure out
some way to motivate them.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.675
Okay, well, you, um-

02:14.760 --> 02:16.677
You could-
Well, what about
a sticker board?

02:16.762 --> 02:19.597
That's how my parents
got me to do chores
when I was a kid.

02:19.681 --> 02:22.850
All right, so I do a chore,
and then I get a star,
and then-

in my mouth.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.032
I will hold my tongue
no further.

You know what this is?
This is a list
of my Cheerios.

someone at random,

we do things a little bit
differently.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.544
Oh, yeah, Will?
How's that workin' out
for you?

02:49.628 --> 02:51.754
You have to
remember something.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.840
We're dealing with children.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.133
They need to be terrified.

02:56.218 --> 02:58.135
It's like mother's milk
to them.

02:58.220 --> 03:02.181
Without it, their bones
won't grow properly.

03:02.266 --> 03:04.183
So if you want results
with a kid,

03:04.268 --> 03:08.521
you find that
competitive animal within,
and unleash it.

Okay.
Ellen, that blouse
is just insane.

Every one of these people
or elements was a champion
in their own right,

competing with each other

complacent.

at the invitational,

- What's a mash-up?
- A mash-up is when
you take two songs...

04:26.433 --> 04:30.728
and mash 'em together to make
an even richer explosion
of musical expression.

that we do for sectionals.

to make a smoothie
out of beef bones,
breaking my juicer.

at Cheerios practice, disaster.

It was like spotting the first
spark on the Hindenburg.

05:47.305 --> 05:51.100

will lose us nationals,

05:51.184 --> 05:54.228

both pack up and move
out of the district.

a defibrillator.
- Huh.

the fly route downfield...

as the play develops, okay?

11:09.586 --> 11:11.712
if you’re not into boobs.

11:11.796 --> 11:15.674
My body's a mess.
I found a hair on my ear
the other day,

11:15.759 --> 11:18.552
and I have to rub
Biofreeze on my shins
a couple times a day.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.637
Growing pains.

11:20.722 --> 11:23.140
It smells pretty bad,
but I mask it with
Drakkar Noir.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.686
Being a guy my age
is tough.

11:27.771 --> 11:30.189
Between Glee and football
and school and being popular,

11:30.273 --> 11:32.191
I'm just kind of overwhelmed.

11:32.275 --> 11:35.277
Everyone wants something
from me, and I don't have
the energy to do it all.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.279
I don't know how
important people
like presidents...

11:37.364 --> 11:40.157
or newscasters
or mob bosses do it.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.159
My mom says I'm
stretched too thin,

11:42.243 --> 11:44.328
so I gave up homework,
but that didn't help.

11:44.412 --> 11:47.122
All I know is,
last night I got vaporized
on level two.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.834
Level two!
And I didn't even have
the energy to care.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.713
[Kurt]
He's drooling.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.799
[Puck]
Dude, wake up.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.967
Sure, yeah.
That sounds good.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.970
- I said, we can't
let those girls beat us.
- Sorry.

12:02.055 --> 12:05.557
Sometimes when
I'm thinking real hard,
it helps to close my eyes.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.185
We're doing a mash-up
of "It's My Life"
and Usher's "Confessions."

12:08.269 --> 12:11.772
We should get some
trash can lids and stomp
the yard up in this piece.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.608
Puck, with respect,
you're more helpful when
you don't contribute.

12:14.692 --> 12:18.362
Dude, what's wrong with you?
Go see the nurse.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.115
Every day I say
I have a headache.
I sleep for three hours.

12:21.199 --> 12:24.660
I haven't attended
a math class in two years.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.830
[Inhales]
Oh. Thanks, guys.

12:27.914 --> 12:31.041

Keep up the good work.

12:31.126 --> 12:33.043
[School Bell Rings]

12:37.924 --> 12:39.883
Uh, okay, girls.
We need to get started.

12:39.968 --> 12:43.387
- We're getting warmed up.
- Where's Quinn?

12:43.471 --> 12:46.765
Probably down at the mall
looking for elastic-waist pants.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.851
[Snickering]

12:50.728 --> 12:53.480
Mr. Schuester's
right, you guys.
We can't get complacent.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.274
Chill out.
I already picked
the songs.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.484
We're gonna do
a mash-up of "Halo"
and "Walking on Sunshine."

12:57.569 --> 13:00.487
- Yeah, that was my idea.
- Whatever.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.948
Come on.
We can do this
in our sleep.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.367
You think those six dudes
are gonna give us
any competition?

13:05.493 --> 13:08.829
I say we just wing it.
We can't just wing it.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.457
All those in favor
of winging it?

13:11.541 --> 13:14.376
All those opposed?

13:15.712 --> 13:18.380
Looks like the ayes have it.

13:25.096 --> 13:27.264
Hi. How can I help you?

13:27.390 --> 13:29.475
Hey, Mrs. Schuester.
Uh-huh.

13:29.601 --> 13:32.769
I'm Finn Hudson.
I'm in Glee with your husband.
Well, hi, Finn.

13:32.854 --> 13:36.064
Oh, wait a minute.
Are you the one who's
dating Quinn Fabray?

13:36.191 --> 13:39.610
Yeah. Why?
Oh, you have
really good bone structure.

13:39.694 --> 13:43.113
Yeah. Um, I've been
really tired lately,

13:43.198 --> 13:45.991
and I was wondering
if I could lie down
in here for a while.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.994
Why don't you have a seat.

13:49.078 --> 13:52.206
Why don't you tell me
a little bit about
your sleep habits.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.833
What time
do you go to bed?
Um, I don't know.

13:54.918 --> 13:58.420
Usually after "Skinemax"
starts playing
regular movies again.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.923
And I'm normally tired,
but lately...

14:01.007 --> 14:04.468
I can’t just fall asleep.
It's like my brain
won't shut up.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.721
Well, what are you
thinking about?

14:07.805 --> 14:09.848
Oh, you can be
honest with me.

14:09.933 --> 14:12.643
There's a code of silence
in my office.

14:12.769 --> 14:17.314
Okay, uh, football plays—
Uh-huh.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.234
um, girls, dance steps,

14:21.486 --> 14:23.362

Girls?

14:23.488 --> 14:26.907
But you're dating
Quinn Fabray.
Yeah, but—

14:30.078 --> 14:33.747
Do you think a guy
can be into two girls at once?
No.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.749
And remember,
flirting is cheating.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.919
And the revenge
of the jilted woman
is usually pretty messy.

14:39.045 --> 14:42.464
So can I take my nap now?
Do you want to sleep
through your life, Finn?

14:42.549 --> 14:46.593
No, but I read once
that teenagers need
more sleep than infants.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.388
When I was in
high school, I captained
the cheerleading squad,

14:49.472 --> 14:52.432
I kept a perfect 4.0 G.P.A.,
I cultivated my popularity...

14:52.517 --> 14:54.935
and I maintained
a loving relationship...

14:55.019 --> 14:57.312
with the boy who would
become my husband.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.731
Wow.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.776
I don't even know
how I did that.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.778
Wait a minute.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.364
Yes, I do.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.366
Pseudoephedrine.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.868
It's the stuff they put
in decongestants to make
them non-drowsy.

15:11.953 --> 15:14.496
It's kind of like a—
Well, like a vitamin.

15:14.581 --> 15:18.083
I would pop two
of these blue meanies
every morning,

15:18.167 --> 15:21.086
and then I would be
a firecracker for
the rest of the day.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.838
Are they safe?

15:22.922 --> 15:25.632
They're over-the-counter.
They stock them
next to the candy bars.

15:25.717 --> 15:28.093
Sweetie,
I'm the school nurse.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.679
I know what I'm doing.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.561
Hey, guys, how's it goin'?

I'm ready and excited.

Come on. Let's get
this joint jumping.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.988
Has your soul been taken over
by caffeinated space aliens?

15:48.072 --> 15:49.990
No, just visited
the school nurse.

15:50.074 --> 15:53.619
Got this great vitamin.
I feel fantastic. I can't
wait to do the number.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.954
Let's do the number,
and then afterwards
we can build a house...

15:56.039 --> 15:57.914
for Habitat for Humanity.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.958
What kind of vitamin?
Vitamin C?

16:00.043 --> 16:02.753
Vogue magazine says
it boosts energy levels
and brightens the complexion.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.881
Vitamin D.

34:41.580 --> 34:44.665
I mean, I-I didn't
have it this bad
when I was your age.

34:44.750 --> 34:48.335
I mean, there weren't as many
TV channels either though.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.379
Is Finn okay with this?
'Cause, you know,

34:50.464 --> 34:53.299
I don't want
any baby-daddy drama
when you hand it over to me.

34:53.383 --> 34:56.761
He's the reason
I'm doing this.

34:56.845 --> 35:01.098
He's such a good guy.
And he internalizes
all this pressure.

35:01.183 --> 35:04.018
He's gonna have
a heart attack.

35:04.102 --> 35:09.732
I never want Mr. Schuester
to find out about this though.
I don't wanna hurt him either.

35:09.816 --> 35:12.359
Oh, your secret's safe with me.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.361
I have a lot more to lose.

35:14.446 --> 35:17.573
One more thing.

35:17.657 --> 35:20.910
You know how you gave me
those vitamins for the baby?
Mm-hmm.

35:20.994 --> 35:23.287
I really appreciated that,

35:23.371 --> 35:26.373
um, but I'm gonna have
all these doctors' bills,

35:26.458 --> 35:28.334
and I'm gonna need
some new maternity clothes.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.962
You want money from me?
It's gonna be your baby.

35:32.047 --> 35:36.091
Which means I'm gonna be paying
the bills for 18 years. I think
you can handle nine months.

35:36.176 --> 35:40.805
Look, you're making
the right call here, Quinn.
It's what's best for everybody.

35:49.314 --> 35:51.232
[Sighs]

35:55.862 --> 35:57.571
Hi.

36:01.618 --> 36:03.577
Hi.

36:04.788 --> 36:06.789
Um, I can't—
I can't stay long
in this room...

36:06.873 --> 36:09.959
because of the germs, you know,
and because of the odor.

36:11.795 --> 36:15.089
But I have a question.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.132
Anything for you, Emma.

36:19.553 --> 36:22.096
So what would, um-

36:22.180 --> 36:25.766
what would getting married
mean... exactly?

36:26.852 --> 36:30.145
Because I would wanna
keep my last name,

36:30.230 --> 36:34.191
and I'd wanna continue living
in different parts of town.

36:34.276 --> 36:38.237
And, um, I think
it would be best if we didn't
see each other after school.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.281
Sure.

36:40.365 --> 36:45.494
And I wouldn't want
a big ceremony, you know, like
in a church or with... people.

36:45.579 --> 36:48.080
We wouldn't have
to invite anybody, you know,
or tell anybody actually.

36:48.164 --> 36:50.833
It could be more
like a secret, you know-
like a secret marriage.

36:50.917 --> 36:54.128
That's actually
a better deal
than I expected.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.965
You're a really good man, Ken.

37:00.760 --> 37:04.972
And I don't want to spend
the rest of my life alone,

37:05.056 --> 37:07.766
and I know
that you don't either.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.063
So,

37:14.274 --> 37:16.191
is that a yes?

37:21.907 --> 37:23.782
What's up, A-Rach?

37:23.867 --> 37:26.619
Hey, sweet mash-up.
You guys were so... energetic.

37:26.703 --> 37:29.538
We were just taking a lesson
from Major League Baseball.

37:29.623 --> 37:32.207
I-I-It's not cheating
if everyone's doing it.

37:32.334 --> 37:35.544
We were just leveling out
the playing field.
You really believe that?

37:37.964 --> 37:41.050
No. Okay?
I-I feel terrible.

37:41.134 --> 37:43.385
Even if we win,
it's not gonna be satisfying.

37:43.470 --> 37:47.181
I know. I don't even
remember performing.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.934
What do you think
we should do?

37:50.018 --> 37:54.104
I think... the only way
to make things right is to just
withdraw from the competition-

37:54.189 --> 37:58.317
You know, admit that we were
wrong and disqualify our
respective teams immediately.

37:58.443 --> 38:02.029
No one gets to win.
Cool.

38:04.032 --> 38:09.912
I'm sorry about what I said
the other day, about calling you
contemptible and deplorable.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.957
Ah, that's all right.
I didn't even know
what those words meant.

38:13.041 --> 38:16.377
W-What I meant to say
is that...

38:16.461 --> 38:19.505
I guess I get caught up
in the competitive hysteria too.

38:19.589 --> 38:21.507
My goals are too selfish.

38:21.591 --> 38:24.927
You know, it's time
for me to stop competing
against everyone...

38:25.011 --> 38:28.722
and start competing
alongside them.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.481
What the hell
were you thinking?

38:37.607 --> 38:40.609
You gave drugs
to my students?
I'll say it again.

38:40.694 --> 38:44.238
They are over-the-counter,
F.D.A. approved, and if
I didn't give it to them,

38:44.322 --> 38:46.699
I'm sure the kids would just
find a way to get it
for themselves.

38:46.825 --> 38:50.577
No. No, they wouldn't.
These are good kids.
Nothing bad happened.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.538
Howard Bamboo got arrested.

38:55.542 --> 38:58.377
Well, that.
Wait. What?

38:58.461 --> 39:03.424
Pseudoephedrine is an ingredient
in the manufacturing
of methamphetamines.

39:03.508 --> 39:06.176
Howard got picked up by the feds
on suspicion of running
a crystal meth lab.

39:06.261 --> 39:08.721
I never told Howard
to get them all in one place.

39:08.805 --> 39:10.723
Okay, enough, Terri.

39:10.807 --> 39:12.808
How are we supposed
to raise a baby...

39:12.892 --> 39:16.353
when I can't trust you
to look after a group
of teenagers?

39:16.438 --> 39:18.313
You are oblivious
to consequences.

39:18.440 --> 39:21.984
I was only trying
to help you, Will.
Don't.

39:22.068 --> 39:25.821
Every time I light
a fire in my life,

39:25.905 --> 39:29.283
you find a way to make sure
it burns the forest down.

39:32.787 --> 39:35.789
I have serious concerns
about your judgment,
Mrs. Schuester.

39:35.874 --> 39:38.459
I must ask you to resign
as school nurse.

39:39.794 --> 39:43.464
Fine. I was working
too hard anyway.

39:45.425 --> 39:50.012
Hold on to your horses, Schue.
I have to question your judgment
in the matter as well.

39:50.096 --> 39:52.473
What? I had no idea
this was even going on.

39:52.557 --> 39:56.101
Exactly.
The children rely on you
to create the culture,

39:56.186 --> 40:00.981
and you, with your obsession
with winning and competition,

40:01.066 --> 40:04.068
has fostered
an unsafe environment.

40:04.152 --> 40:07.279

and excellence.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.872

Mr. Schue.

We didn't mean
to get you into trouble.

40:20.585 --> 40:23.837
I'm really disappointed
in you guys.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.839
Glee is supposed to be about
what's inside your heart,

40:25.924 --> 40:27.800
not what's coursing
through your veins.

40:27.884 --> 40:30.427
We know, and I think
I speak for everyone
when I say...

40:30.512 --> 40:33.514
that we'd be happy
to move forward and put
this episode behind us.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.849
Well, it's not that simple.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.851
Because of this debacle,

40:37.936 --> 40:40.729
it's been decided
that I'm no longer fit
to run Glee Club myself.

40:41.856 --> 40:44.483
We've been assigned
a codirector.

You know Ken, um,
asked me to marry him.
