♪♪

00:07.608 --> 00:08.809
Good morning, Josh.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.611
Hey! Hi! You're here.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.883
So, uh, you know,
after we broke up in therapy,

00:12.883 --> 00:15.516
I wasn't quite sure how
things were gonna be between us.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.618
Was it gonna be awkward?
Were you gonna poison my...

00:17.618 --> 00:19.050
breakfast?
You didn't, did you?

00:20.491 --> 00:21.992
Josh, I'm fine.

00:21.992 --> 00:24.925
Sofia gave me a pep talk
and a tiny little pill,

00:24.925 --> 00:26.457
and things are good.

00:27.658 --> 00:30.161
Well, things are
gonna get even better.

00:30.161 --> 00:33.334
Gabi, I've decided to continue
therapy on my own.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.306
I already had a phone session
with Dr. Rounds this morning.

00:35.306 --> 00:36.537
That's great.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.669
First thing she recommended I do
to tackle my commitment issues,

00:38.669 --> 00:41.342
is contact all the women
I've hurt from my past
and make amends with them.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.174
That's insane!

00:44.845 --> 00:45.876
Excuse me?

00:45.876 --> 00:49.049
Well, speaking as your
most recent hurtee,

00:49.049 --> 00:50.821
uh, here's a little something
I've learned.

00:50.821 --> 00:52.683
Nobody wants to relive it.

00:54.225 --> 00:56.087
I get it, and I hear ya.

00:57.828 --> 00:59.560
Your sarcasm
and your judgment,

00:59.560 --> 01:01.892
they're coming from a place
of hurt and and rejection.

01:01.892 --> 01:03.734
No!

01:03.734 --> 01:05.966
It's coming from a place
of how could you not kiss me

01:05.966 --> 01:08.139
and then take me to therapy
and break up with me?

01:08.139 --> 01:10.070
You broke up with you!

01:10.070 --> 01:11.071
You agreed!

01:12.573 --> 01:15.276
Oh my-- I knew our
friendly little exchange
was too good to be true.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.348
Will you tell me something?
Is it gonna be like this
every day?

01:17.348 --> 01:19.810
Just every day I'm here.

01:21.452 --> 01:23.083
Well, then, maybe
you shouldn't be.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.755
(gasp)

01:24.755 --> 01:26.317
Are you firing me?

01:26.317 --> 01:28.189
No, I'm not firing you.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.820
I'm just saying
maybe a little space.

01:29.820 --> 01:32.393
I would never fire you. I know
how hard it would be for you
to find another job.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.565
Oh, trust me, I could
find another job

01:34.565 --> 01:35.666
if I wanted to, okay?

01:35.666 --> 01:37.668
You know what you can't do?
Live without me.

01:37.668 --> 01:39.570
What? You?

01:39.570 --> 01:41.202
(laughs) What?

01:42.403 --> 01:44.074
Let me tell you
something, Josh.

01:44.074 --> 01:45.736
If you hadn't been into me
for the last year,

01:45.736 --> 01:47.578
you would have been
with thousands of girls,

01:47.578 --> 01:49.640
probably divorced
four times by now.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.743
Our unstable relationship
has kept you stable.

01:52.743 --> 01:55.085
(laughs) Oh, has it?

01:55.085 --> 01:57.248
'Cause, uh...

01:57.248 --> 01:59.820
I was doing pretty good
before you came along.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.392
Oh, really?

02:01.392 --> 02:03.924
Well, then, uh, maybe we should
take some time apart.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.526
How does two weeks sound?

02:05.526 --> 02:06.697
Lovely.

02:06.697 --> 02:08.429
Beautiful.

02:08.429 --> 02:11.332
Have fun with your amends,
or should I say, "a mess."

02:11.332 --> 02:13.404
'Cause that's what you'll be
with me not here. Goodbye.

02:13.404 --> 02:15.005
-Good luck!
-I won't need it!

02:16.307 --> 02:18.008
But I will need you to pay me
for those two weeks.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.012
(theme music playing)

02:25.476 --> 02:27.318
♪ She in the spotlight ♪

02:27.318 --> 02:29.580
♪ And she turned my head ♪

02:29.580 --> 02:31.382
♪ She run a red light ♪

02:31.382 --> 02:33.153
♪ 'Cause she bad like that ♪

02:33.153 --> 02:36.126
♪ I like that
ooh, baby, ooh, baby ♪

02:36.126 --> 02:37.288
♪ Baby ♪

02:37.288 --> 02:40.090
♪ I like that
ooh, baby, ooh, baby ♪

02:40.090 --> 02:42.763
And then he says to me,
"Of course I wouldn't fire you.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.236
"You can't get another job."

02:45.236 --> 02:47.137
Gabi, I would sympathize,

02:47.137 --> 02:49.069
but we're out of butter,
and I'm kind of panicking.

02:50.201 --> 02:51.472
I know!

02:51.472 --> 02:53.444
I think we used it frying
all those grilled cheeses.

02:53.444 --> 02:54.675
Ugh, Gabi,

02:54.675 --> 02:56.877
these breakups are gonna
put 300 pounds on us.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.380
(sigh) God, I hate
those Kaminskis.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.212
Oh, I hate those
Kaminskis more.

03:01.212 --> 03:02.413
(gasp) S'mores.

03:02.413 --> 03:03.884
How good do those sound?

03:05.155 --> 03:06.787
Not as good as
cookie dough ice cream.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.759
Do you have that
on the food truck?

03:08.759 --> 03:10.190
No. We don't sell
that kind of stuff.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.263
Well, you should. You should
keep an emergency stash

03:12.263 --> 03:13.464
for people who
just got dumped.

03:13.464 --> 03:15.025
Screw that. There should be
a whole truck

03:15.025 --> 03:16.297
for people who
just got dumped.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.368
(both gasp)

03:17.368 --> 03:18.399
Both:
Oh my God.

03:19.670 --> 03:21.632
A truck that caters to girls
who just got dumped.

03:21.632 --> 03:23.033
The Dump Truck.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.636
That's genius!

03:25.636 --> 03:27.207
Jake gave me his half
of the truck,

03:27.207 --> 03:28.439
so I can do
what I want with it.

03:28.439 --> 03:29.940
We should rename it
The Dump Truck

03:29.940 --> 03:31.312
and run it together
and split the profit.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.814
-I'm in!
-(both squeal)

03:33.814 --> 03:35.045
Okay, what's the first step?

03:35.045 --> 03:36.747
We put on pants.

03:39.890 --> 03:41.151
Josh,

03:41.151 --> 03:43.454
that girl you're making
amends to is on her way up.

03:43.454 --> 03:45.256
Oh, okay, uh,

03:45.256 --> 03:47.598
everyone look busy, and--
and stay close to me

03:47.598 --> 03:49.029
in case she gets mad
and tries to attack me.

03:49.029 --> 03:51.362
I was horrible to this girl
in high school.

03:51.362 --> 03:52.633
What did you do?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.665
Tell her the auditions for Cats
were at the pep rally

03:54.665 --> 03:56.407
and have her show up as
Mr. Mistoffelees?

03:58.269 --> 04:00.641
Ella was my girlfriend
senior year,

04:00.641 --> 04:02.273
and we were supposed
to go to prom together.

04:02.273 --> 04:04.845
but at the last minute,
I ditched her and went with
somebody I barely knew.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.777
I couldn't ditch my prom date.

04:06.777 --> 04:08.949
He would've failed me in math.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.022
(knocking)

04:13.584 --> 04:14.985
Josh!

04:18.258 --> 04:19.490
I'm Josh.

04:20.431 --> 04:21.492
Josh!

04:21.492 --> 04:22.533
Hey!

04:22.533 --> 04:25.095
Ella, wow,
you look amazing!

04:25.095 --> 04:26.397
Thanks!

04:26.397 --> 04:28.639
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.
It's just been so long.

04:28.639 --> 04:30.641
I couldn't put
a face to a name.

04:30.641 --> 04:33.203
You're kidding right?
We dated.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.577
We met in chemistry lab.
We became partners.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.178
We kissed,
and your hair was all, whoof,

04:38.178 --> 04:39.610
caught on fire.
How do you forget that?

04:39.610 --> 04:42.012
Maybe 'cause
it never happened.

04:44.515 --> 04:45.856
Ella,

04:45.856 --> 04:48.218
Ella, Ella, Ella.

04:48.218 --> 04:50.591
It's obvious that
you're blocking out
a very difficult time.

04:50.591 --> 04:53.424
That's what she's doing.
She's blocking out
a difficult time.

04:53.424 --> 04:55.726
Which is why I invited you
over here in person.

04:55.726 --> 04:56.797
So I could make amends.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.229
Look,
I know I hurt you.

04:59.229 --> 05:00.771
Hurt me?

05:00.771 --> 05:02.473
What are you talking about?

05:02.473 --> 05:04.505
You know...

05:04.505 --> 05:05.806
prom.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.077
(gasp)

05:07.077 --> 05:08.178
I just remembered.

05:08.178 --> 05:09.580
She just remembered.

05:09.580 --> 05:12.583
Didn't you have a hot
younger brother named Jake?

05:13.884 --> 05:16.587
Yes, he does.

05:16.587 --> 05:18.288
Maybe that's who hurt her.

05:18.288 --> 05:19.750
That makes a lot more sense.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.151
I hurt her! It was me!

05:21.151 --> 05:23.394
Now, you two, go away.

05:23.394 --> 05:25.155
Fine. We don't
have to be here.

05:25.155 --> 05:26.497
(chuckles)

05:26.497 --> 05:28.298
We can hear everything
from the bathroom.

05:29.259 --> 05:30.761
So, anyway,

05:30.761 --> 05:32.933
Ella, I just want to say
that I'm really sorry
for what happened.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.805
It had absolutely
nothing to do with you.

05:34.805 --> 05:36.006
I was young and an idiot.

05:36.006 --> 05:37.838
Okay, well...

05:37.838 --> 05:39.039
apology accepted.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.811
Wh-- uh...

05:40.811 --> 05:43.644
Wait, I mean, let's, uh,
let's at least have a drink.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.345
You know, I really wanna
make this up to you.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.017
Sure, if that
makes you feel better.

05:48.078 --> 05:50.080
It does. It really does.

05:51.622 --> 05:52.953
To new friends!

05:52.953 --> 05:54.324
Old friends.
We're old friends.

05:54.324 --> 05:56.627
We've known each other
since high school!

06:00.891 --> 06:02.132
Oh my God.

06:02.132 --> 06:04.234
Sofia, dumped girls.

06:04.234 --> 06:06.667
Dumped girls everywhere!

06:06.667 --> 06:10.240
We are about to turn
so much pain into profit!

06:10.240 --> 06:11.371
Yes!

06:11.371 --> 06:14.475
Um, hi, can I help you?

06:14.475 --> 06:17.377
Uh, our special today is
"He Can Quiche My Ass."

06:17.377 --> 06:19.249
I'll take that,

06:19.249 --> 06:22.352
and a "Good Thing I Only
Let Him Put In
The Tri-tip Sandwich."

06:24.855 --> 06:29.189
My ex slept with my roommate,
and I miss him so much!

06:29.189 --> 06:31.221
You know what I'm throwing in
on the house?

06:31.221 --> 06:33.464
A cup of "Miso Angry Soup."

06:33.464 --> 06:34.725
Thank you.

06:34.725 --> 06:37.428
Oh, no, thank you,
and stay strong, sister.

06:37.428 --> 06:38.699
(sobbing)

06:38.699 --> 06:41.572
Wow. You know, if business
keeps up like this,

06:41.572 --> 06:44.575
not only will I not have to go
back to Josh's in two weeks...

06:44.575 --> 06:47.407
Gabi may not have to come
to work ever again.

06:48.779 --> 06:50.410
Look at what I've done.

06:51.482 --> 06:54.014
Walked two blocks
without collapsing?

06:54.014 --> 06:57.918
Do you think that Gabi's
measly 67 Twitter followers

06:57.918 --> 06:59.590
would get her
this kind of attention?

06:59.590 --> 07:00.891
Please.

07:00.891 --> 07:02.593
I'm a publicist.

07:02.593 --> 07:05.355
I have a network of people
at my fingertips.

07:05.355 --> 07:08.459
I am a social media god.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.262
You helping Gabi? I never
thought I'd see the day.

07:12.262 --> 07:15.636
Think about it. If Gabi's truck
is a huge success,

07:15.636 --> 07:18.639
she won't have time
to work for Josh.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.812
I'm turning two weeks
into forever!

07:21.812 --> 07:23.544
(phone beeps)

07:23.544 --> 07:25.045
Oh my God.
It's happening.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.017
I contacted
every media outlet

07:27.017 --> 07:29.079
and now they want her
on Rachel Ray!

07:30.150 --> 07:32.152
Really? Cake? Do you want
to be alone forever?

07:36.456 --> 07:38.128
Gabi! Great news!

07:38.128 --> 07:41.632
As you know, I have
your best interest at heart...

07:41.632 --> 07:43.263
Trap. It's a trap.

07:44.294 --> 07:45.736
Who's your favorite chef ever?

07:45.736 --> 07:47.097
Julia Child?

07:47.097 --> 07:48.799
One that's not dead.

07:48.799 --> 07:50.470
Rachel Ray?

07:50.470 --> 07:53.904
Guess who's going on Rachel Ray
to talk about her food truck?

07:53.904 --> 07:54.975
(gasp)

07:54.975 --> 07:56.807
If it's not me,
you're really mean!

07:56.807 --> 07:57.848
It is you!

07:57.848 --> 07:59.650
-(screams)
-Oh my God!

07:59.650 --> 08:02.312
Both: Rachel Ray!
Rachel Ray! Rachel Ray!

08:10.490 --> 08:12.763
Morning, sweetie.

08:12.763 --> 08:15.125
You're in my bed.
Why are you in my bed?

08:16.126 --> 08:18.128
'Cause you were
amazing last night.

08:18.128 --> 08:20.200
Amazing at what?
What was I amazing at?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.402
Honey, you changed my life!

08:22.402 --> 08:24.204
Well, our lives.

08:25.235 --> 08:26.336
Aah!

08:26.336 --> 08:28.078
Wh-- Wh--

08:28.078 --> 08:29.509
What is this?

08:29.509 --> 08:30.941
A ring.

08:30.941 --> 08:32.442
I know.

08:32.442 --> 08:35.145
But what's it doing
on my married finger?

08:35.145 --> 08:38.048
Well, we got married,
silly willy.

08:38.048 --> 08:40.320
Married. Wait, wait, wait.
We can't be married.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.952
We didn't go to Vegas.
Wait, did we go to Vegas?

08:41.952 --> 08:44.094
We didn't have to.
You're rich.

08:44.094 --> 08:46.026
I mean, we're rich,

08:46.026 --> 08:50.260
and we paid a lot of money
and made it happen! Yay!

08:50.260 --> 08:51.531
No clapping!

08:51.531 --> 08:53.133
This is not a clapping matter.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.905
We can't be married.
We don't know each other.

08:54.905 --> 08:56.867
I mean, you said last night,
you didn't remember me.

08:56.867 --> 08:59.339
I didn't until we spent
the whole night

08:59.339 --> 09:01.972
looking at our old yearbooks
and started reminiscing.

09:01.972 --> 09:03.844
All the feelings
came flooding back.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.275
Oh, really? How about
the bad feelings

09:05.275 --> 09:06.847
from when you hated me
for what I did to you?

09:06.847 --> 09:09.319
Did those come back?
Where are the bad feelings?
Where are the bad feelings?

09:09.319 --> 09:13.924
They're gone because you made
the greatest amends of all.

09:13.924 --> 09:17.588
You vowed
to never hurt me again.

09:17.588 --> 09:19.590
I did?

09:19.590 --> 09:21.091
Yes, you did.

09:21.091 --> 09:24.234
Now, I am going to take
a soak in...

09:24.234 --> 09:26.767
our tub, and when I'm done,

09:26.767 --> 09:28.669
we'll call our parents
and tell them the good news.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.741
(chuckling)
All right, see ya!

09:30.741 --> 09:32.142
Oh, (bleep).

09:37.577 --> 09:39.349
(gasp) Elliot,

09:39.349 --> 09:40.611
my greatest supporter,

09:40.611 --> 09:43.213
my favorite publicist
in the entire universe,

09:43.213 --> 09:45.786
-my dearest friend--
-Hug me, and I'll cut you.

09:47.618 --> 09:51.421
Hey, Yolanda. I just came
to pick up my knives

09:51.421 --> 09:53.363
(loudly) for Rachel Ray.

09:53.363 --> 09:55.265
I came early
so I wouldn't run into Josh.

09:55.265 --> 09:57.267
You know, the last thing
I wanna do is upset him

09:57.267 --> 09:59.770
(loudly) by telling him
I'm gonna be on Rachel Ray.

09:59.770 --> 10:01.401
So, um, where is he?

10:01.401 --> 10:04.034
Uh, I think
he's still in bed.

10:04.034 --> 10:05.936
Oh, well, I guess
it's for the best, then.

10:05.936 --> 10:07.938
I'll just...
(loudly) grab my knives

10:07.938 --> 10:10.080
and be on my way!

10:11.141 --> 10:12.312
Okay, I got them!

10:15.846 --> 10:17.217
Time...

10:18.789 --> 10:20.150
to...

10:22.052 --> 10:24.154
go...

10:24.154 --> 10:26.396
-Josh: Yolanda! Elliot!
-Aw, rats.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.229
Guys--

10:29.229 --> 10:30.861
Hey.

10:30.861 --> 10:32.062
Gabi.

10:32.062 --> 10:33.764
Gabi's here. I didn't think
you were gonna be here.

10:33.764 --> 10:35.936
Why are you here? You know,
I didn't think you were gonna
be here,

10:35.936 --> 10:37.307
'cause you said,
"I'm not gonna be here."

10:37.307 --> 10:40.440
Oh, well, I just came to get
my knives, 'cause I'm...

10:40.440 --> 10:42.442
going to New York
in a couple-- (gasp)

10:42.442 --> 10:44.344
Oh, well, I might as well
just come out and say it.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.276
Um...

10:46.276 --> 10:48.618
My food truck
is doing so well

10:48.618 --> 10:50.480
that Rachel Ray
found out about it,

10:50.480 --> 10:51.982
and she wants me
to be on her TV show.

10:51.982 --> 10:53.553
Rachel Ray? Wow-wee!

10:53.553 --> 10:54.725
Good for you!
Have fun!

10:56.026 --> 10:57.527
Um...

10:57.527 --> 10:59.389
So, uh,
how's your week going?

10:59.389 --> 11:01.261
Is it, uh,
(sing-songy) as good as mine?

11:01.261 --> 11:03.593
Oh it has been. You know,
just, amending my ass off.

11:03.593 --> 11:04.795
Hashtag, no regrets.

11:04.795 --> 11:06.566
But hey, you, you know what?

11:06.566 --> 11:08.338
You go and
break a leg out there.

11:08.338 --> 11:09.740
Good luck. Bye!

11:09.740 --> 11:12.142
Guys, last night, I...

11:14.174 --> 11:15.345
got married.

11:15.345 --> 11:16.476
What now?

11:16.476 --> 11:18.508
Oh, yeah.
I'm married to Ella.

11:18.508 --> 11:20.350
What the hella?

11:20.350 --> 11:21.681
I got so caught up
in making amends,

11:21.681 --> 11:23.213
I just kept drinking
and drinking and drinking.

11:23.213 --> 11:24.715
I mean, Yolanda,
I don't know how you do it.

11:24.715 --> 11:26.286
What? I don't--

11:26.286 --> 11:27.918
Everyone, shut up!

11:30.791 --> 11:32.062
I got nothing.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.665
I got something.

11:35.665 --> 11:37.798
Get me 50 grand
in small bills.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.170
I know someone
who can make things happen.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.373
Wait, you mean
like a divorce?

11:43.373 --> 11:44.474
Sure.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.507
Let's call it that.

11:50.340 --> 11:52.212
Rachel Ray. Rachel Ray.
Rachel Ray.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.015
-Rachel Ray. Rachel Ray--
-Okay, you gotta stop bouncing.

11:55.015 --> 11:58.188
Sofia, she is my idol.

11:58.188 --> 12:00.690
It's like if you
were about to meet...

12:00.690 --> 12:02.422
the guy who invented...

12:02.422 --> 12:03.924
the filing cabinet.

12:05.195 --> 12:08.628
Edwin G. Seibels? I wish.

12:08.628 --> 12:10.901
You know what? How about
we get you some ice cream
to calm you down.

12:10.901 --> 12:12.532
Nope. I wanna
look good on camera.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.905
You know, all the food
in here is free.

12:14.905 --> 12:16.236
I will take five.

12:18.108 --> 12:20.570
(crowd cheering)

12:21.842 --> 12:24.244
Okay, I am really excited
about my next guest,

12:24.244 --> 12:25.816
but I wanna start
with a show of hands.

12:25.816 --> 12:28.078
How many people here
love food trucks?

12:29.820 --> 12:33.784
Okay, so please welcome
first-timers to our show,

12:33.784 --> 12:36.286
Gabi Diamond
and Sofia Rodriguez.

12:36.286 --> 12:37.928
(crowd cheering)

12:37.928 --> 12:39.729
Rachel:
Hey, girls. Welcome.

12:39.729 --> 12:40.991
Ladies, come on down.

12:40.991 --> 12:42.893
-Hello.
-Hi, how are you?

12:42.893 --> 12:45.665
Nice to-- oh, we're gonna do
a group hug. Oh, that's good.

12:45.665 --> 12:47.697
Oh, that's nice. Okay.

12:47.697 --> 12:49.069
Gabi, why don't you sit here.

12:49.069 --> 12:51.071
Sofia, why don't you
take the end there?

12:51.071 --> 12:53.904
Ladies, honestly,
this is brilliant,

12:53.904 --> 12:56.476
but which one of you
got dumped?

12:56.476 --> 12:57.707
Both: I did.

12:57.707 --> 12:59.749
(laughing)

12:59.749 --> 13:02.412
Actually, we both did.
We were dating brothers

13:02.412 --> 13:04.714
and they both dumped us
on the same day.

13:04.714 --> 13:07.357
Okay, so how do you go
from being, like, double dumped

13:07.357 --> 13:09.619
to selling food off a truck?

13:09.619 --> 13:10.790
And did it start
with just, like,

13:10.790 --> 13:12.262
okay, let's sell food
off our truck

13:12.262 --> 13:14.965
and serve everything
with a side of "He Is Toast"?

13:14.965 --> 13:17.727
(laughing) You're
so funny, Rachel Ray.

13:17.727 --> 13:21.201
But tell me, guys, what is--
what is actually your
best seller so far?

13:21.201 --> 13:23.133
Oh, well that--
that would be the burger.

13:23.133 --> 13:26.476
Um, it's made with arugula
and a honey truffle sauce,

13:26.476 --> 13:29.309
and it's named after my
ex-boyfriend, Josh Kaminski.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.843
It's called the
"I Can't Kaminski Burger."

13:32.843 --> 13:35.085
-Ah, I can't Kaminski.
That's very funny.
-Thank you.

13:35.085 --> 13:37.047
It's made with
a blend of three meats

13:37.047 --> 13:40.020
because, you know,
who can commit to just one?

13:40.020 --> 13:41.922
I love that!

13:41.922 --> 13:43.994
You know, you guys
are just so grounded,

13:43.994 --> 13:46.126
Gabi, especially you,
I just think you're taking this,

13:46.126 --> 13:47.858
this whole thing,
like, so well.

13:47.858 --> 13:48.929
What do you mean?

13:48.929 --> 13:52.762
Well, you know,
that Josh Kaminski got married.

13:52.762 --> 13:55.305
(laughing) What are you
talking about, Rachel Ray?

13:55.305 --> 13:57.067
What do you mean,
what am I talking about?

13:57.067 --> 14:00.310
I mean, it's literally
all over social media,
all over the Internet.

14:00.310 --> 14:03.543
No. (chuckles)
No. What?

14:03.543 --> 14:07.847
Wait, you seriously
did not know this?

14:07.847 --> 14:11.281
I... I... I...

14:11.281 --> 14:13.183
She did not.

14:13.183 --> 14:15.956
Okay, now I think would be
a really great time

14:15.956 --> 14:18.858
for a short break, and we'll
come back with the ladies,
like, right after this.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.030
(cheering)

14:21.691 --> 14:23.633
(cheering)

14:23.633 --> 14:25.996
Oh, my goodness.
Welcome back, guys.

14:25.996 --> 14:28.338
So, I'm back with
Gabi and Sofia,

14:28.338 --> 14:30.200
and so, Gabi,

14:30.200 --> 14:32.042
what are you going to be
cooking up for us today?

14:32.042 --> 14:34.104
This is... not... happening.

14:34.104 --> 14:37.207
Uh, you know what? Sofia,
why don't you get us started?

14:37.207 --> 14:39.749
Okay. Today,
we'll be demonstrating

14:39.749 --> 14:41.651
how to make our
best-selling dessert,

14:41.651 --> 14:43.253
"Kick Him in
the Bourbon Balls."

14:43.253 --> 14:44.784
(laughs)

14:44.784 --> 14:47.387
Um, uh,
the best part is...

14:47.387 --> 14:48.488
Gabi?

14:48.488 --> 14:51.761
I can't believe it.
He's, he's really... married.

14:51.761 --> 14:54.194
We let the customers
crush the nuts themselves.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.665
(laughs)

14:55.665 --> 14:57.167
Rachel, would you like
to do the honors?

14:57.167 --> 14:58.528
-Oh, I would--
-No, I will do it.

14:58.528 --> 15:00.630
Gabi, I don't think
that's a good idea.

15:00.630 --> 15:03.803
All you do is...
gently tap the nuts...

15:03.803 --> 15:05.635
over and over until...

15:05.635 --> 15:06.736
(shrieks)

15:06.736 --> 15:08.278
I don't understand,
you know?

15:08.278 --> 15:10.280
He... he couldn't commit.

15:10.280 --> 15:12.282
And I leave for...
five minutes,

15:12.282 --> 15:14.414
and now he's married...
to someone else?

15:14.414 --> 15:15.785
So he can commit,

15:15.785 --> 15:17.617
-just not to me! (crying)
-(yelps)

15:18.788 --> 15:20.620
I'm such a loser!

15:20.620 --> 15:22.622
Gabi...

15:22.622 --> 15:24.324
(chuckles nervously)

15:24.324 --> 15:26.326
You know,
you are not a loser.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.198
You had the idea
for the Dump Truck,

15:28.198 --> 15:30.400
and it's, it's brilliant.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.133
No, it's a truck for
loser girls who got dumped

15:33.133 --> 15:34.634
because they are losers!

15:34.634 --> 15:36.566
She doesn't mean that.
She doesn't mean that.

15:36.566 --> 15:37.867
-Yes, I do.
-You know, listen,

15:37.867 --> 15:41.111
you do not need a man
to be successful.

15:41.111 --> 15:43.343
(crying) Yes, I do.

15:43.343 --> 15:47.677
Josh bought me the truck,
and then his publicist
got me on your show,

15:47.677 --> 15:49.849
and the only reason
he kept me on as his chef

15:49.849 --> 15:52.222
is because we slept together
on the first date

15:52.222 --> 15:55.225
and he thought
that I would sue.

15:55.225 --> 15:57.657
Can we go to commercial,
Rachel Ray?

15:57.657 --> 16:00.090
God, I wish
we already had.

16:00.090 --> 16:02.492
Okay, so we'll be back
right after this.

16:02.492 --> 16:03.793
(cheering)

16:09.439 --> 16:11.141
How could he get married?

16:11.141 --> 16:13.503
Oh, Gabi,
it's gonna be okay.

16:13.503 --> 16:16.006
I thought up a whole plan
for you on the plane,

16:16.006 --> 16:17.177
but I didn't get to tell you.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.679
Because, unfortunately,
we didn't get to sit together.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.381
(mouths) Thank you, God.

16:22.382 --> 16:23.553
Okay.

16:23.553 --> 16:26.256
(clears throat) Tomorrow,
you're gonna go to Josh's,

16:26.256 --> 16:27.687
and you are going to quit.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.060
Because you cannot work
for him and his new wife.

16:30.060 --> 16:32.492
-(sobbing)
-No no no.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.494
And then, we're
going to sell the truck,

16:34.494 --> 16:36.326
and you're gonna use
that money to live off of

16:36.326 --> 16:37.797
until you figure things out.

16:41.831 --> 16:45.735
Won't we make more money
renting the truck
than selling it?

16:45.735 --> 16:48.208
Well, we would have until you
called every dumped girl

16:48.208 --> 16:49.739
a loser on national TV.

16:52.482 --> 16:54.584
All I wanted to do was show him
how great my life would be

16:54.584 --> 16:57.847
without him for two weeks,
and now I have to be
without him forever.

16:59.549 --> 17:02.252
This is the worst
two-week paid vacation

17:02.252 --> 17:03.653
of my entire life!

17:08.228 --> 17:10.230
How the hell am I going
to get out of this?

17:10.230 --> 17:12.402
My offer still stands.

17:15.004 --> 17:16.866
Spoke to Spike,

17:16.866 --> 17:18.408
he's down.

17:20.070 --> 17:22.742
I'm not just talking about
the marriage, Yolanda.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.874
I mean, the whole point of me
calling her was to make amends,

17:24.874 --> 17:27.077
not to hurt the girl worse,
and let's be real here,

17:27.077 --> 17:28.648
she's obviously
an unstable person.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.920
I mean, who instantly marries
someone they haven't seen
in 12 years?

17:30.920 --> 17:32.752
You.

17:34.984 --> 17:37.257
Hi, honey. I'm home.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.788
-I had a key made.
-She had a key made.

17:40.190 --> 17:43.733
Is my sexy new husband gonna
give his wifey a kiss?

17:43.733 --> 17:46.566
Mmmm. Why ask
if you're just gonna?

17:47.567 --> 17:49.239
I have a surprise
for you, hubby.

17:49.239 --> 17:52.102
Another surprise? I don't think
I could handle another surprise!

17:57.107 --> 17:58.578
Who's this?

17:58.578 --> 18:01.351
You remember my noni.
She lives with me,

18:01.351 --> 18:03.713
but now that we're married,
she's gonna live with us.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.016
(chuckles)
No, no, no, noni.

18:07.016 --> 18:09.189
(chuckles)

18:09.189 --> 18:11.321
Okay, Ella, look,

18:11.321 --> 18:13.123
I need to tell
you something.

18:13.123 --> 18:15.895
Ugh, this is hard.
This is so hard.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.967
Tell, me. What?
What's going on with you, honey?

18:17.967 --> 18:20.300
You look pale. You look like
you're about to faint.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.302
Okay, the thing is--

18:22.302 --> 18:24.103
Does your chest feel tight?

18:24.103 --> 18:25.605
Does your heart hurt?

18:25.605 --> 18:28.778
Do you feel a lump
in the pit of your stomach?

18:28.778 --> 18:31.110
Do you feel like every hope
and dream you ever had is dead?

18:31.110 --> 18:33.743
Yes, that's totally it.

18:33.743 --> 18:36.045
So it's kind of like
how I felt

18:36.045 --> 18:38.148
when I was crying
under the bleachers at prom.

18:42.822 --> 18:43.853
Hmm?

18:46.596 --> 18:48.798
Ha! I've been playing you!

18:48.798 --> 18:51.461
We're not married!
Suck it, Kaminski!

18:51.461 --> 18:52.732
Josh: Wait.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.934
What are you saying?

18:54.934 --> 18:57.667
I am saying
we're not really married.

18:57.667 --> 18:58.908
I slipped something
in your drink

18:58.908 --> 19:00.270
and then I slipped
a ring on your finger.

19:00.270 --> 19:02.172
You what?

19:02.172 --> 19:04.374
Let me tell you something.

19:04.374 --> 19:07.177
I will never forget the night
you ruined my life!

19:07.177 --> 19:09.719
I have been waiting
12 years for my revenge,

19:09.719 --> 19:11.551
and now, I have it.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.882
Come on, Zelda.

19:12.882 --> 19:14.724
Fatburger's on me.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.400
Gabi, you're, uh...

19:32.141 --> 19:33.673
You're here! I mean, uh...

19:35.074 --> 19:36.806
How much of that
did you hear?

19:36.806 --> 19:38.878
Oh, just enough
to know that

19:38.878 --> 19:40.680
you're totally
a mess without me.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.312
(sigh)

19:42.312 --> 19:44.584
I am.
I really am.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.658
Which is why I think we should
cut the two-week thing short,

19:48.658 --> 19:49.819
and you come back
to work tomorrow.

19:49.819 --> 19:52.161
Aw, Josh, I don't know. I--

19:52.161 --> 19:53.293
-Please!
-Okay.

19:55.094 --> 19:57.096
I need you to stop me
from making amends

19:57.096 --> 19:59.028
with all of my exes...

19:59.028 --> 20:00.230
except for one.

20:00.230 --> 20:01.501
Really? Have you
learned nothing?

20:01.501 --> 20:04.774
-It's to you.
-Oh, okay.

20:04.774 --> 20:08.077
I never apologized
for what happened.

20:08.077 --> 20:10.209
And I feel horrible
that we got so close,

20:10.209 --> 20:11.541
and then I screwed it up.

20:13.182 --> 20:14.714
Gabi, I'm really sorry.

20:17.647 --> 20:19.088
Apology accepted.

20:22.992 --> 20:24.654
-Grilled cheese?
-You know me so well.

20:29.259 --> 20:30.600
So, how was your week?

20:33.032 --> 20:35.965
Any chance you, uh,
saw me on Rachel Ray?

20:35.965 --> 20:38.868
Uh, no. I mean, with everything
that was happening, I missed it.
How did it go?

20:38.868 --> 20:40.069
Crushed it.

20:43.513 --> 20:45.545
Ah, I can't believe
you sold my truck,

20:45.545 --> 20:46.746
and I didn't get a penny.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.278
Gabi, we both agreed.

20:48.278 --> 20:50.620
Josh bought the truck.
He should get his money back.

20:50.620 --> 20:53.222
Ugh, damn us
and our moral fiber.

20:54.424 --> 20:55.725
Oh, hey, did you tell
the new owner

20:55.725 --> 20:57.026
-about the broken
parking brake?
-Shh.

20:57.026 --> 20:58.758
Hi!

20:58.758 --> 21:01.561
Gabi, this is the girl
I sold the food truck to.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.092
Gabi Diamond, meet
Gabi Moskowitz.

21:03.092 --> 21:05.665
-Hey, Gabi.
-Hi, Gabi.

21:05.665 --> 21:07.266
I really like what
you've done with the truck.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.799
-Thanks.
-Yeah, how'd you come up
with the name?

21:09.799 --> 21:12.101
Well, I have a blog called
Broke Ass Gourmet

21:12.101 --> 21:14.774
where I teach people how to
cook yummy food on the cheap,

21:14.774 --> 21:17.246
and now I'm taking it
to the streets.

21:17.246 --> 21:18.778
I'm hoping it'll lead
to big things,

21:18.778 --> 21:21.150
like, maybe even
inspire a TV show.

21:21.150 --> 21:23.182
-For sure.
-You go, girl.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.284
Like that'll ever happen.
