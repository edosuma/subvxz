WEBVTT

00:06.004 --> 00:07.284
I thought we were
all wearing our

00:07.309 --> 00:09.844
old catering uniforms together.

00:09.878 --> 00:10.945
Nobody said that, dude.

00:10.979 --> 00:12.613
You're supposed to
return it when you quit.

00:12.647 --> 00:15.182
Yeah, Ilana, we're not caterers
at Darcy's wedding,

00:15.217 --> 00:16.984
- we're guests.
- I know, Morgan, thanks.

00:17.018 --> 00:19.587
Abbi, can you believe that
Darcy's the first of the

00:19.621 --> 00:20.754
trifecta to get married?

00:20.789 --> 00:22.656
I can... she's been engaged
for like seven years.

00:22.691 --> 00:24.091
Oh, my God, Ilana,

00:24.126 --> 00:25.760
you have to take so many
pictures of us tonight.

00:25.786 --> 00:26.427
Yeah, it will be fun.

00:26.461 --> 00:29.997
I mean, sorry, not of us, of the
trifecta-me, Abbi, and Darcy.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.165
I worked with you guys, too.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.280
I thought we were the quad.

00:33.238 --> 00:34.878
Honestly, Morgan's
boner for you is so big

00:34.903 --> 00:36.270
you can see it from space.

00:36.304 --> 00:37.371
You should just let
her suck it already.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.606
So, now I have the boner?

00:38.640 --> 00:40.040
I thought that
Morgan had the boner.

00:40.041 --> 00:42.543
Oh, my God, Connecticut
is so classy.

00:42.577 --> 00:43.911
God, no it isn't.

00:43.945 --> 00:45.379
Why are we even going there?

00:45.413 --> 00:48.682
Don't be insane, Ilana, I mean
Darcy is marrying the heir to

00:48.717 --> 00:50.317
Jennifer friggin' Convertibles.

00:50.352 --> 00:51.352
It's gonna be so amazing.

00:51.386 --> 00:53.354
I brought all the
essentials-gum, Adderall,

00:53.388 --> 00:54.355
and poppers.

00:54.389 --> 00:55.750
We gotta bring our
A-game, bitches.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.791
There better be good boys there.

00:57.826 --> 01:00.761
I'm the first woman in my family
to be 25 and still single?

01:00.795 --> 01:03.697
This year I had to bring
myself up to minorities,

01:03.732 --> 01:05.299
and still nothing.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.767
Move our asses, bitches!

01:06.801 --> 01:07.768
Got some good momentum.

01:07.802 --> 01:08.443
Come on!

01:08.754 --> 01:11.408
It's so crazy that you're coming
with me to this wedding, right?

01:11.434 --> 01:12.072
No.

01:12.107 --> 01:13.474
It's only our second date.

01:13.508 --> 01:14.575
It's not crazy at all.

01:14.609 --> 01:17.144
Plus I get to see you in
this dress, maybe out of it.

01:17.179 --> 01:18.179
Will!

01:20.315 --> 01:21.282
Okay, chill.

01:21.316 --> 01:22.283
We've got time.

01:22.317 --> 01:23.284
I'm pumped.

01:23.318 --> 01:24.285
I love weddings.

01:24.319 --> 01:25.853
I crush at weddings.

01:25.887 --> 01:27.448
Wait till you see me on
the dance floor.

01:27.956 --> 01:30.658
Um, Ilana, what are we even
doing in Grand Central?

01:30.692 --> 01:31.926
Is there a garage
in here or something?

01:31.960 --> 01:33.120
Where's your mom's car parked?

01:33.128 --> 01:34.328
Uh, Long Island.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.597
Uh, Ilana, what the frick!

01:36.631 --> 01:39.133
You said that we could get
your mom's car for this trip.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.202
I e-mailed you every day for
like two months.

01:41.236 --> 01:42.336
I didn't get any e-mails.

01:42.370 --> 01:45.773
Is your e-mail address still
Ilanawaxler@vagina.com?

01:45.807 --> 01:48.342
No, it's mindmyvagina.com.

01:48.376 --> 01:49.410
That's why.

01:49.444 --> 01:50.778
Don't worry, dude, chill.

01:50.812 --> 01:51.946
I got us tickets.

01:51.980 --> 01:53.480
Oh, my God, we gotta go.

01:53.515 --> 01:54.915
Come on, we got
a couple minutes!

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:08.997 --> 02:12.800
Uh, Ilana, why is there no 2:10
train to Bridgeport anywhere?

02:12.834 --> 02:14.468
I don't know...
I'm not a conductor.

02:16.538 --> 02:18.839
Ilana, these are
Amtrak tickets, dude.

02:18.873 --> 02:20.808
It only runs outta Penn Station.

02:20.842 --> 02:21.875
Oh, gross.

02:21.910 --> 02:23.110
Alright, let's go, come on.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.412
I-I can't run.

02:25.447 --> 02:26.727
I'm gonna sweat
off my concealer.

02:29.551 --> 02:30.884
Holy (bleep)!

02:31.925 --> 02:33.721
This place really is majestic.

02:39.961 --> 02:40.928
Taxi!

02:40.962 --> 02:41.962
Taxi!

02:44.148 --> 02:45.308
It's been a whirlwind, right?

02:45.333 --> 02:46.367
I know.

02:46.401 --> 02:48.535
- Both been having fun.
- Yeah.

02:48.570 --> 02:51.038
- Talked about getting that dog.
- Uh-huh.

02:51.072 --> 02:54.949
But, um, Penn Station-I can't.

02:56.084 --> 02:57.136
It's disgusting.

02:57.912 --> 02:59.304
It's kind of a
deal-breaker for me.

03:00.782 --> 03:01.982
Okay, I'm confused.

03:02.017 --> 03:04.818
Maybe this is one of those
romantic New York City stories

03:04.853 --> 03:09.690
where you meet someone amazing,
and then... tragedy happens.

03:10.191 --> 03:13.027
And they're gone, and
you never see them again,

03:13.061 --> 03:15.061
and you wonder what they did
with their whole life.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.342
- Good luck, kid.
- Taxi's here. Come on!

03:21.702 --> 03:22.911
Okay, everybody in.

03:23.605 --> 03:24.634
Abbi, sit by me.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.740
I don't even know
what just happened.

03:27.533 --> 03:30.053
Okay you sit in the middle, but
I don't wanna sit next to Ilana.

03:30.078 --> 03:32.146
Sure, sit on Morgan's boner.

03:32.180 --> 03:34.089
Guys, I just got dumped.

03:34.402 --> 03:36.283
Abbi, wait!

03:36.318 --> 03:37.217
Wait!

03:38.420 --> 03:39.177
Wait!

03:41.356 --> 03:42.656
Oh, it's just not meant to be.

03:51.804 --> 03:54.244
Oh, my G, my God, you guys remer
Brian O., the head bartender?

03:54.269 --> 03:57.672
He stopped eating
carbs and got totally ripped.

03:57.806 --> 04:01.108
My brother did that-he
doesn't eat carbs-he's jacked.

04:03.645 --> 04:08.082
Anyway, he became a DJ in
Provincetown, then he OD'd.

04:08.183 --> 04:09.550
Dead!

04:09.685 --> 04:11.018
Wow, geez.

04:11.186 --> 04:13.554
Only the good die young, huh?

04:13.689 --> 04:16.457
You know, I'm not
over Amy Winehouse.

04:16.625 --> 04:19.694
It's like we
knew it would happen,

04:19.862 --> 04:22.430
but we didn't do anything
about it.

04:22.564 --> 04:26.467
I didn't "know her" know
her, but I still miss her.

04:28.704 --> 04:29.971
You guys remember Steff?

04:30.005 --> 04:32.565
Yes, the one who used to eat out
of the trash... Ew, right, okay.

04:32.574 --> 04:35.610
So, she worked that retirement
party, married some old dude and

04:35.744 --> 04:39.881
then OD'd a week later at Bryant
Park on the carousel.

04:40.015 --> 04:40.848
Dead!

04:40.983 --> 04:43.117
You remember Ray... (bleep)

04:43.252 --> 04:44.485
Are you okay?

04:44.620 --> 04:45.620
Oh, my gosh, are you all right?

04:45.721 --> 04:46.621
Everybody okay?

04:46.755 --> 04:48.705
Kevin, your nose is bleeding.

04:49.491 --> 04:52.693
Oh, no, this
isn't from the crash.

04:52.794 --> 04:54.462
It happens all the time.

04:54.563 --> 04:56.030
But I need to get outta
here before the cops come.

04:56.131 --> 04:56.995
Everybody out.

04:56.995 --> 04:58.048
Go, go, go!

05:22.658 --> 05:23.958
- Can you take this?
- Yeah.

05:23.992 --> 05:25.359
Whoo! I am hot, too.

05:25.394 --> 05:27.061
I have blotting
sheets if anybody needs.

05:27.095 --> 05:28.129
I could use one.

05:28.163 --> 05:29.130
You might need two, sweetheart.

05:29.164 --> 05:30.131
Oh, my God!

05:30.165 --> 05:31.365
It left us.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.700
It left without us!

05:32.734 --> 05:34.251
What?

05:35.370 --> 05:36.470
No!

05:36.505 --> 05:37.838
No, no.

05:37.873 --> 05:39.840
Oh, my God!

05:39.875 --> 05:42.777
All right, okay!

05:42.811 --> 05:44.011
We gotta go right now!

05:44.046 --> 05:45.146
Come on, let's move it!

05:45.180 --> 05:46.180
Move it!

05:46.214 --> 05:47.181
Move, move, move!

05:47.215 --> 05:48.016
Come on!

05:49.417 --> 05:50.384
No, no, no, no!

05:50.418 --> 05:51.952
Eighth Avenue.

05:51.986 --> 05:53.787
Ilana, come on, move it!

05:53.822 --> 05:54.788
Move it!

05:54.823 --> 05:56.056
Come on!

05:56.091 --> 05:57.224
Abbi, I'm behind you!

06:04.400 --> 06:06.502
So, it's $70
a day to rent a car.

06:06.536 --> 06:07.503
Totally doable.

06:07.537 --> 06:09.244
Do you wanna insure the driver?

06:09.244 --> 06:10.078
- Yes.
- Yes.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.663
Do you want to insure
against other cars?

06:11.663 --> 06:12.414
- Yes.
- Yes.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.157
Potholes?

06:13.157 --> 06:13.874
- Yes.
- Yes.

06:13.874 --> 06:14.291
Weather?

06:14.291 --> 06:14.743
- Yes.
- Yes.

06:14.778 --> 06:15.878
- Trees?
- Uh-huh.

06:15.912 --> 06:17.112
God?

06:17.147 --> 06:18.413
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:18.448 --> 06:21.617
Transition insurance for when I
pull the car around... make sure

06:21.651 --> 06:23.752
you get that last
one... I'm a terrible driver.

06:23.787 --> 06:25.087
- Okay.
- Sure.

06:25.121 --> 06:29.091
With all that, it comes to $125.

06:29.125 --> 06:30.626
Okay.

06:30.660 --> 06:32.394
License and credit card, please.

06:35.598 --> 06:36.771
Oh.

06:37.233 --> 06:38.867
You're under 25.

06:38.902 --> 06:40.269
That changes things.

06:51.714 --> 06:53.448
That'll be $1,100.

06:53.483 --> 06:56.285
Oh... we're gonna need
one moment, please.

06:56.319 --> 06:57.653
Thank you so much.

06:58.855 --> 07:00.255
All right, come 'ere, huddle up.

07:00.290 --> 07:04.526
Okay, so, we both know that I'm
25, but what Mary doesn't yet

07:04.561 --> 07:06.862
know is that my
license is expired.

07:06.896 --> 07:09.164
We're gonna need to come up with
a plan in the next 20 seconds

07:09.199 --> 07:12.000
inside this huddle, 'cause
when I created the huddle,

07:12.035 --> 07:13.969
I thought by this
time I'd have a plan.

07:14.003 --> 07:14.970
I don't.

07:15.004 --> 07:17.306
- I'm gonna keep...
- Here's my license and the AMEX

07:17.340 --> 07:18.371
should cover insurance.

07:19.876 --> 07:21.510
This isn't a sugar daddy thing.

07:21.544 --> 07:24.613
This is just an old, established
"guy paying for his younger

07:24.647 --> 07:26.782
friend he has sex
with" kind of thing,

07:27.467 --> 07:29.427
so just get that right out
of your mind, you know?

07:29.452 --> 07:30.419
Well, you're all set.

07:30.453 --> 07:31.887
There's only one vehicle left.

07:31.921 --> 07:35.390
It doesn't have AC,
but it's really spacious.

07:36.017 --> 07:36.892
We'll take it.

07:56.579 --> 07:58.780
Oh... okay.

07:58.815 --> 08:00.382
Gotta love that
transitions insurance.

08:05.455 --> 08:06.688
Man, it's hot in here.

08:06.723 --> 08:10.325
Gotta commend you, I got adult
braces two years ago, and it was

08:10.360 --> 08:11.894
the best decision I ever made.

08:11.928 --> 08:12.895
Check me out.

08:12.929 --> 08:14.763
- Oh, those are nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:14.797 --> 08:16.131
But these aren't braces.

08:16.165 --> 08:18.867
They're mouth scaffolding,
just to hold my teeth in.

08:18.902 --> 08:19.868
Mouth scaffolding?

08:19.903 --> 08:20.903
I've never heard of that.

08:20.904 --> 08:22.638
I'm a dentist, and
I haven't heard of that.

08:22.672 --> 08:24.139
I went to Nicaragua for 'em.

08:24.173 --> 08:26.275
They were so reasonable.

08:28.501 --> 08:30.421
Okay, you're dancing
against the truck right now.

08:30.446 --> 08:31.880
You gotta dance with it, girl.

08:34.517 --> 08:36.018
God, this is terrible.

08:36.052 --> 08:37.019
I don't know.

08:37.053 --> 08:38.754
It kinda feels good on my back.

08:38.788 --> 08:40.522
Yeah, I mean
it's actually kinda fun.

08:40.556 --> 08:41.756
Good save, Morgan.

08:41.791 --> 08:44.025
Abbi, do you remember that
holiday party that we thought

08:44.059 --> 08:46.361
that we ran out of cheeseballs,
and then it turned out we had

08:46.387 --> 08:47.979
more cheeseballs in the back?

08:49.370 --> 08:51.400
Yeah, the cheeseballs.

08:51.434 --> 08:52.434
Yeah.

08:57.573 --> 09:00.809
I'm not gettin' married until
everyone can get married.

09:04.147 --> 09:06.212
Why did you look at me
when you said "everyone"?

09:08.384 --> 09:09.818
What do you mean?

09:09.852 --> 09:11.134
What do you mean?

09:13.456 --> 09:14.423
You gay, man.

09:14.457 --> 09:15.424
Oh, yeah, I am.

09:15.458 --> 09:16.425
I'm totally gay.

09:16.459 --> 09:17.426
I got it now.

09:17.460 --> 09:18.493
I got what you mean.

09:24.217 --> 09:26.177
Abbi, do you remember
that time the chicken satays

09:26.202 --> 09:28.236
were way underdone?

09:28.371 --> 09:29.204
Do you remember?

09:29.372 --> 09:30.439
I still laugh about it.

09:33.710 --> 09:35.410
This bitch is unraveling.

09:35.445 --> 09:36.812
I am well aware.

09:45.083 --> 09:46.164
What are we laughing about?

09:46.189 --> 09:47.255
I don't know.

09:52.265 --> 09:54.305
God, I can't believe Will
didn't go to Penn Station.

09:54.330 --> 09:55.597
What a little bitch.

09:55.631 --> 09:57.499
It's the most vibrant
place in the city,

09:57.533 --> 09:59.034
and they have really good sushi.

09:59.068 --> 10:01.935
You know what,
I'm fine that he left.

10:02.638 --> 10:05.907
He had a really big penis.

10:05.942 --> 10:06.942
How big, how big, how big?

10:06.943 --> 10:08.410
Like, think
earth, like think earth.

10:08.444 --> 10:12.781
Coke can, plantain big.

10:12.815 --> 10:14.216
Oh, God!

10:17.153 --> 10:18.453
What are those?

10:18.488 --> 10:19.588
Poppers.

10:19.622 --> 10:20.589
What do they do?

10:20.623 --> 10:22.391
They loosen your butthole.

10:22.425 --> 10:23.959
Why you takin' it right now?

10:23.993 --> 10:25.560
'Cause we're going to a wedding.

10:25.595 --> 10:27.295
Hello?

10:27.330 --> 10:28.797
Abbi, this keeps
happening to you.

10:28.831 --> 10:31.133
You're like a magnet
for elephant dongs

10:31.167 --> 10:33.635
God, you know who had
the really big dick?

10:33.669 --> 10:34.836
My brother, Mitchell.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.283
Hold on, Morgan,
did you say something

10:39.308 --> 10:40.709
about your brother's dick?

10:40.743 --> 10:41.710
I didn't mean to say that.

10:41.744 --> 10:42.744
Just forget it.

10:42.779 --> 10:44.620
Delete, delete, delete,
delete, delete, delete.

10:55.091 --> 10:55.822
Everybody okay?

10:56.659 --> 10:59.027
Why would Jesus give
us a flat tire?

10:59.062 --> 11:00.262
Well, he did, Morgan.

11:00.296 --> 11:01.563
God, it is over!

11:01.597 --> 11:03.498
Guys, the Sei Wah bus
runs every half hour.

11:03.533 --> 11:04.499
Ew, disgusting, Ilana.

11:04.534 --> 11:05.534
You're disgusting.

11:05.568 --> 11:06.968
I think that's our only
option right now, so...

11:07.003 --> 11:08.270
Yeah, okay, Abbi,
you're totally right.

11:08.304 --> 11:09.271
I agree with you.

11:09.305 --> 11:10.639
You know, we could ride down.

11:10.673 --> 11:11.640
Ilana, we are in formalwear.

11:11.674 --> 11:12.707
We cannot bike down.

11:12.742 --> 11:14.294
It's 4:00 o'clock.

11:14.294 --> 11:15.800
We're not getting
a cab right now.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.634
This is our best bet.

11:16.634 --> 11:17.134
Totally.

11:17.146 --> 11:19.681
Okay, so to recap-Abbi and I
have decided that we're going to

11:19.715 --> 11:21.583
bike down to the
Sei Wah bus, okay?

11:21.617 --> 11:22.584
- Whoo-hoo!
- Great.

11:22.618 --> 11:23.585
All right, come on on, let's go.

11:23.619 --> 11:24.986
Come on, come on, come on!

11:25.021 --> 11:26.888
- Let's go!
- Abbi, I'm coming!

11:26.923 --> 11:28.023
Lincoln, come on.

11:28.057 --> 11:28.730
I can't.

11:29.055 --> 11:30.735
Someone has to stay
with the truck and call

11:30.760 --> 11:32.360
the rental car company.

11:32.395 --> 11:33.962
I can't leave
you here by yourself.

11:33.996 --> 11:37.199
You can't not go to
a wedding you RSVP'd to.

11:37.233 --> 11:41.534
You have to respect
the sanctity of the RSVP.

11:43.096 --> 11:45.460
I was uncomfortable at the fact
that you were my date

11:45.460 --> 11:47.042
to a wedding... that's
like so legit.

11:47.076 --> 11:48.910
But now that you're
not coming, I'm bummed.

11:48.945 --> 11:52.614
And that makes me uncomfortable
in a different way.

11:52.648 --> 11:55.016
Are you just sayin' that so
I'll do the rest of the dance?

11:55.051 --> 11:55.965
The what?

12:12.768 --> 12:14.102
What's painfully ironic about

12:14.137 --> 12:17.472
this is that I love
weddings the most.

12:19.842 --> 12:21.409
Pump it, pump it!

12:21.444 --> 12:22.644
You guys, if we don't
pick up the pace,

12:22.678 --> 12:24.379
we're gonna miss this 4:30.

12:24.413 --> 12:25.981
Harder, harder!

12:26.015 --> 12:28.083
You are warriors
of change right now.

12:28.117 --> 12:29.484
What are your passions?

12:29.519 --> 12:31.620
Who lights your fire?

12:31.654 --> 12:32.754
Gossip!

12:32.788 --> 12:34.222
Rihanna's instagram.

12:34.257 --> 12:35.857
My brother!

12:35.892 --> 12:36.858
Never mind!

12:36.893 --> 12:38.059
Delete, delete that!

12:38.094 --> 12:39.594
Hey, Kevin, what's up
with your bike, dude?

12:39.629 --> 12:41.463
We're all on city bikes.

12:41.497 --> 12:42.831
What?

12:42.865 --> 12:44.232
I thought we
were all stealing bikes.

12:44.267 --> 12:46.701
I-I-I can't go back to
prison, Ilana!

12:46.736 --> 12:47.736
I can't go...

12:49.405 --> 12:50.372
Whoo!

12:50.406 --> 12:51.673
High on life!

12:51.707 --> 12:53.408
Look at me now, solstice!

12:53.442 --> 12:54.876
Whoo!

12:54.911 --> 12:56.044
Yeah!

12:56.078 --> 12:58.079
Look at me now, New York City!

12:58.114 --> 12:59.881
Whoo!

13:07.673 --> 13:09.834
Okay, so, if we make this bus,
then we'll just miss the

13:09.859 --> 13:12.127
cocktail hour, but we'll
make it time for apps before

13:12.161 --> 13:13.195
the ceremony.

13:13.229 --> 13:15.197
This is the opposite of
the time the trifecta took

13:15.231 --> 13:17.232
the Jitney to the Hamptons.

13:17.266 --> 13:18.500
I never heard about that.

13:18.534 --> 13:19.701
It... it wasn't a big deal.

13:19.735 --> 13:21.336
We just went to the
Hamptons for the weekend.

13:21.370 --> 13:22.871
Darcy's parents
have a timeshare.

13:22.905 --> 13:24.839
That was a really crazy
weekend, huh, Abbi?

13:24.874 --> 13:26.541
I don't know if it's
really worth talking about.

13:26.576 --> 13:29.678
Okay, I think it's very
much worth talking about.

13:29.712 --> 13:32.180
Remember we went
to that club, The Elm?

13:32.215 --> 13:33.848
The Elm, that sounds cool.

13:33.883 --> 13:34.715
It wasn't.

13:35.451 --> 13:38.587
Oh, my God, she doesn't know?

13:38.621 --> 13:40.121
Know what?

13:40.156 --> 13:41.690
Oh, this is gonna be so rich.

13:41.724 --> 13:44.092
Okay, when we
went to the Hamptons,

13:44.126 --> 13:48.036
Darcy and Abbi made out.

13:51.735 --> 13:54.170
It was before I knew you.

14:04.114 --> 14:06.081
Ilana, it's not a big deal.

14:06.116 --> 14:07.483
It's a huge deal.

14:07.517 --> 14:09.084
You said that if you were
ever gonna do same-sex

14:09.119 --> 14:11.346
experimentation,
it was gonna be with me.

14:12.122 --> 14:14.056
I have never said that to you.

14:14.090 --> 14:15.791
It has been implied.

14:15.826 --> 14:16.826
By you.

14:20.063 --> 14:22.364
Well, implications get
responses,

14:22.399 --> 14:25.234
and it takes two to tango.

14:27.671 --> 14:29.805
Oh... okay.

14:32.309 --> 14:34.540
Oh, my God.

14:35.145 --> 14:36.245
Where are we even?

14:37.747 --> 14:39.548
♪ Confess to the nervousness ♪

14:39.683 --> 14:42.718
♪ As we stumble to the close of
the troubled chapter ♪

14:42.886 --> 14:44.487
♪ These notes have been torn ♪

14:44.571 --> 14:46.331

the truth burns through ♪

14:46.356 --> 14:48.057

14:53.997 --> 14:57.900

15:06.042 --> 15:07.643
Ilana, there'seats.

15:07.677 --> 15:10.279
I'm gonna sit with somebody
whose yet to shatter my world.

15:11.982 --> 15:12.982
Hello, new friend.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.165
Yeah.

15:17.854 --> 15:18.954
You okay?

15:18.989 --> 15:22.992
Yeah, I'm just-I'm listening
to this relaxation mix.

15:23.026 --> 15:24.260
Do you wanna?

15:24.294 --> 15:25.508
All right, sure.

15:26.663 --> 15:27.607
...too shall pass.

15:28.398 --> 15:34.336
You are beautiful, you are
strong, you are supple, Morgan.

15:34.371 --> 15:35.604
What is this?

15:35.639 --> 15:37.373
My brother made if for me.

15:37.407 --> 15:38.541
He's a yoga teacher.

15:38.575 --> 15:39.497
Isn't it helpful?

15:40.277 --> 15:41.277
He's good, right?

15:43.013 --> 15:45.714
Ilana, will you just come
on and sit back here?

15:45.749 --> 15:49.485
No, I will not just
"come on," and you know why.

15:49.519 --> 15:50.953
'Cause you made out with Darcy.

15:50.987 --> 15:51.987
You told him?

15:54.324 --> 15:55.591
Fine.

15:55.725 --> 15:57.459
You know what
else Darcy and I did?

15:57.627 --> 15:59.995
We touched boobs.

16:04.501 --> 16:07.469
We touched boobs,
We touched boobs!

16:07.537 --> 16:09.238
We touched boobs!

16:09.372 --> 16:11.206
We touched boobs!

16:11.341 --> 16:12.675
We touched boobs.

16:20.183 --> 16:21.150
Oh, my God.

16:21.184 --> 16:22.685
Oh, my God, what is this?

16:22.719 --> 16:24.286
It's a fish! Oh, my God!

16:24.321 --> 16:25.721
Get out!

16:25.755 --> 16:27.189
Move, move, move!

16:27.223 --> 16:28.190
I'm getting out!

16:28.224 --> 16:29.345
I'm getting off of this bus!

16:34.364 --> 16:35.331
I hate you all!

16:35.365 --> 16:36.565
It's going down my underwear.

16:42.606 --> 16:44.239
Oh, God!

16:44.274 --> 16:46.008
Ilana, F-you!

16:46.042 --> 16:48.143
You did this to
bring down the trifecta.

16:48.178 --> 16:50.512
Morgan, what are
you talking about?

16:50.547 --> 16:51.547
We don't even hang out anymore.

16:51.581 --> 16:52.881
There's no trifecta.

16:52.916 --> 16:55.184
It's more of like a duo now.

16:55.218 --> 16:56.485
So...

16:56.519 --> 16:57.519
Oh, my God, keep talking.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.520
- I'm legit gonna cry.
- Okay.

16:58.555 --> 17:00.623
- Oh my god.
- Well, fine!

17:00.657 --> 17:02.925
Have fun doing all
your drugs together,

17:02.959 --> 17:06.060
you druggie lesbian dudes!

17:06.096 --> 17:07.496
Go (bleep) your brother, dude.

17:12.801 --> 17:13.817
You smell.

17:14.704 --> 17:16.171
All right, give
me Lincoln's clothes.

17:16.205 --> 17:17.172
I'll change.

17:17.207 --> 17:19.375
Okay, I'll block you,
and I'm gonna peek.

17:19.409 --> 17:20.576
No, dude, you're not peeking.

17:20.609 --> 17:21.239
Come on.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.880
Fine, today you can peek.

17:24.914 --> 17:26.382
This one time.

17:29.252 --> 17:31.754
Well, you didn't
get flat tire insurance.

17:31.788 --> 17:33.355
What do you mean I didn't
get flat tire insurance?

17:33.390 --> 17:34.890
I bought every
insurance you offered.

17:34.924 --> 17:38.494
Before I rented you the car, I
went through an itemized list.

17:38.528 --> 17:41.563
If you wanted flat tires
covered, you should have asked

17:41.598 --> 17:43.098
for flat tires.

17:43.133 --> 17:44.733
I'm not a mind-reader.

17:44.768 --> 17:48.570
Listen, Mary, I've
had an awful day.

17:48.605 --> 17:51.573
I was on my way to a wedding, I
wasn't able to make the wedding.

17:51.608 --> 17:53.208
Imagine how disappointed I am.

17:53.243 --> 17:55.077
I shine at weddings.

17:55.111 --> 17:56.679
You can't look the other
way on this?

17:56.713 --> 17:57.680
Look the other way?

17:57.714 --> 17:58.914
Yeah?

17:58.948 --> 18:00.916
You think 'cause you come in
here in your little short-shorts

18:00.950 --> 18:03.652
looking all Idris
Elba that I'm supposed

18:03.687 --> 18:05.954
to like give everything up?

18:05.989 --> 18:07.656
Idris Elba?

18:07.691 --> 18:09.130
Don't act like you don't know.

18:10.427 --> 18:11.465
You look like him.

18:12.662 --> 18:15.831
All right, well,
Mary, where do I sign?

18:19.970 --> 18:21.905
Wait, are we talking
Luther or the Wire?

18:49.834 --> 18:51.634
Oh, I was supposed
to tell you something.

18:51.669 --> 18:52.757
Anything.

18:53.404 --> 18:54.370
Mom called.

18:54.405 --> 18:55.739
She needs your social.

18:55.773 --> 18:56.940
Did you write it down?

18:56.974 --> 18:58.441
No, that's why
I'm telling you now?

18:58.476 --> 19:00.236
Mitchell, what's the
point of telling me now?

19:00.244 --> 19:01.557
I'm just gonna forget it.

19:02.179 --> 19:03.580
Go, you're so much like dad.

19:07.017 --> 19:07.984
I don't know.

19:08.018 --> 19:09.285
I think I'd be Penn.

19:09.320 --> 19:11.321
- I get to be Teller?
- You wanna be Teller?

19:11.355 --> 19:15.325
I'll be whoever you
don't wanna be, you know?

19:16.336 --> 19:17.794
- Oh.
- That's what I mean.

19:17.828 --> 19:18.476
Whoa.

19:20.222 --> 19:20.864
I feel bad.

19:20.898 --> 19:23.600
- I have to tell Darcy we can't come.
- She's fine.

19:23.634 --> 19:26.269
She invited 300 other people.

19:28.539 --> 19:29.572
Great.

19:29.607 --> 19:31.040
They're not coming either.

19:31.075 --> 19:32.408
Let's just do this.

19:34.912 --> 19:35.879
Do you, Darcy...

19:35.913 --> 19:36.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:36.914 --> 19:39.261
I do, he does, whatever.

19:40.084 --> 19:41.084
You smell good now.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.354
Oh, you smell like Lincoln.

19:44.388 --> 19:46.352
Yeah, I smell
exactly like Lincoln.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.270
I'm gonna grab the N
train around the corner.

19:48.270 --> 19:48.792
Me, too.

19:48.826 --> 19:50.527
- I'm headed that way.
- Okay, cool.

19:52.930 --> 19:53.771
Huh.

19:54.431 --> 19:57.467
We are perfect gentlemen, dude.

19:57.501 --> 19:59.569
We're in tuxes.

19:59.603 --> 20:02.305
- Right, it's like...
- We have to.

20:03.953 --> 20:04.704
Right?
