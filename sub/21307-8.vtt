AGNES: Survival bag.

00:08.559 --> 00:09.792
TINMIAQ: You have enough
oil and spark plugs?

00:09.894 --> 00:11.460
-Yeah.

00:11.529 --> 00:14.163
Today, me and Tinmiaq are
going to be packing up and
taking the snow machine and

00:14.465 --> 00:15.731
sled to Kiwalik.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.467
We're going to be picking up
a freight sled down there.

00:18.536 --> 00:22.905
It has our tarps and teepees
that needs to come back
to town and get repaired so

00:22.973 --> 00:25.374
they'll be ready
for use next season.

00:27.111 --> 00:29.578

<i>But with Agnes's husband,</i>

00:38.422 --> 00:42.124

01:01.779 --> 01:05.514
AGNES: It's gonna be pretty much
six, seven hours of total
riding today at good speed.

01:06.717 --> 01:08.650
It's not gonna be
the best weather.

01:08.753 --> 01:10.753
It's gonna be cold, stormy.

01:10.821 --> 01:14.022
We're gonna hopefully
get to camp and come back
without getting lost.

01:15.192 --> 01:16.091
Ready then?

01:16.193 --> 01:17.960
-Yes, ma'am.

01:27.338 --> 01:31.240
AGNES: It's gonna take us
120 miles to get there
and 120 miles to get back.

01:31.509 --> 01:33.342
It's just gonna
take a lot of time.

01:35.246 --> 01:38.580
We're just gonna go all the
way to camp today and get our
freight sled and hopefully

01:38.682 --> 01:41.450
we'll come back safe.

01:45.589 --> 01:50.025
Whoa, what was that?

01:53.898 --> 02:00.169
(theme music plays)

02:14.084 --> 02:18.754
¶ ¶

02:18.823 --> 02:20.222
My snow machine's
not going anywhere.

02:20.324 --> 02:21.957
I just burned it up.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.659
Not going nowhere.

02:23.727 --> 02:26.862
Just cruising along the trail
and stuff, and just going,
and then all of a sudden,

02:26.964 --> 02:27.996
it just stopped.

02:28.098 --> 02:30.365
I think this cancels
our trip for now.

02:30.434 --> 02:34.736
We're not even one mile
away from town, and so,
this is kind of messed up.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.207
Just doesn't seem like
we're gonna be able
to go anywhere now.

02:38.442 --> 02:40.676
The only place this is going
is right back to the shop.

02:41.111 --> 02:43.378
I could almost cry.

02:44.448 --> 02:45.714
This ain't going anywhere.

02:45.816 --> 02:47.482
I just take the belt off and.

02:47.585 --> 02:48.617
-Ready to be dragged back?

02:48.686 --> 02:50.652
-Ready to be dragged
back to town.

02:50.721 --> 02:53.222
There's absolutely nothing we
can do for this snow machine.

02:54.959 --> 02:56.892
That's it.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.428
I guess it's better
off we break down right
here next to town,

02:59.630 --> 03:01.897
than in the middle of
the whole adventure.

03:03.067 --> 03:05.968
Or we get all the way to
camp and then break down.

03:06.136 --> 03:08.470
-(bleep),(bleep).

03:08.539 --> 03:11.106
-Look like we're not gonna
be going anywhere today,
except back to the house and

03:11.208 --> 03:12.908
work on the snow machine.

03:12.977 --> 03:15.244
And if the weather's
still good tomorrow,
we can just try again.

03:16.413 --> 03:18.680
At least we got our own trail.

03:25.489 --> 03:29.458
ANDY: It's the little everyday
things that you don't pay
attention to that come back to

03:29.560 --> 03:31.426
bite you oftentimes.

03:39.637 --> 03:41.370
Puppy, puppy, puppies!

03:41.472 --> 03:42.704
It's a new day today!

03:42.806 --> 03:44.940
You guys get to
be big dogs today!

03:45.843 --> 03:47.910
You guys get to
be big dogs today!

03:48.112 --> 03:50.479
No more feeding in the pen.

03:50.648 --> 03:54.483
<i>NARRATOR: For Andy Bassich,</i>
<i>using sled dogs along the</i>
<i>Yukon River is a way of life.</i>

03:55.552 --> 04:00.088
<i>The dogs allow him to</i>
<i>access winter resources and</i>
<i>haul heavy loads year-round.</i>

04:00.724 --> 04:03.558
<i>Maintaining a kennel</i>
<i>requires him to breed</i>
<i>and train new dogs,</i>

04:04.395 --> 04:07.462
<i>and today is the first</i>
<i>day of school for his</i>
<i>two newest puppies.</i>

04:08.632 --> 04:11.233
-Come on, let's go
out, let's go out!

04:11.335 --> 04:13.068
Let's go get chow-chow.

04:13.170 --> 04:16.705
What I'm trying to do right
now is transition the puppies
from living in the dog pen to

04:16.774 --> 04:19.174
big dogs in the kennel.

04:19.376 --> 04:23.946
And the first step
of this is to associate
food with being in the,

04:24.014 --> 04:26.748
the kennel with the big dogs.

04:28.385 --> 04:30.919
Come on Naty,
Naty, Naty, come!

04:31.822 --> 04:33.021
Where'd she go off to?

04:33.090 --> 04:34.323
Okay, you get your chow.

04:34.391 --> 04:35.557
Come on over here, G.

04:35.659 --> 04:37.359
Right here with the big dogs.

04:37.428 --> 04:40.195
There ya go, big guy.

04:40.431 --> 04:43.165
Oh boy, Naty, Naty, come on!

04:43.634 --> 04:44.733
Chow-chow.

04:44.835 --> 04:47.202
G is definitely ready to go.

04:47.438 --> 04:50.706
He's ready to be in the, in
the dog lot and transition.

04:50.808 --> 04:53.108
Naty's being a lot more aloof.

04:53.177 --> 04:56.545
She's obviously realizing
there's some, some
change in the routine.

04:57.348 --> 04:58.480
Come on, Naty.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.616
Let's go, let's go, come on.

05:01.785 --> 05:05.020
Oh, you're getting to be
too big a dog to carry, Nat!

05:05.122 --> 05:06.621
(laughs).

05:07.091 --> 05:08.457
Look at that girl.

05:08.559 --> 05:10.392
Let's go get chow-chow.

05:10.461 --> 05:12.861
Let's go get chow-chow.

05:12.930 --> 05:16.932
So I'm gonna have to take her
over and give her a positive
experience to get fed today.

05:17.568 --> 05:19.868
Here, you want some of that?

05:19.937 --> 05:22.270
Mm-hmm, that's
pretty good stuff.

05:22.339 --> 05:25.140
They're at an age now where
their head space is good.

05:25.209 --> 05:29.778
My goal right now is to get
'em into the team, and learn
all of the routines that go

05:30.047 --> 05:32.814
into being a sled dog.

05:34.585 --> 05:36.451
We're just gonna hook
up like, nine dogs.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.954
Take a run downriver
and hopefully the
puppies will follow.

05:39.690 --> 05:41.456
Good boy, G.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.160
Okay, let's go, hup, hup!

05:46.663 --> 05:51.133
In the course of my
30 years of mushing, I've
probably had 150, 200 dogs.

05:51.802 --> 05:55.804
It's all about
good-quality food, good
training, and consistency.

05:56.473 --> 05:58.573
Woo-hoo, all right.

06:01.078 --> 06:02.577
The puppies are doing good.

06:02.679 --> 06:06.815
If I can transition 'em
this spring into being an
active member in the team,

06:07.751 --> 06:11.653
then next fall when
I begin my training,
they're already into it.

06:12.056 --> 06:14.556
They know what to
do, and then they will
actually be a working,

06:14.658 --> 06:18.193
productive member of the team,
instead of just a tag-along.

06:18.562 --> 06:20.495
Up we go.

06:20.597 --> 06:22.464
Come on, Geo!

06:22.866 --> 06:25.400
Come on, G-man!

06:25.769 --> 06:29.004
Hey, all right, good boys!

06:29.940 --> 06:31.606
Good run!

06:31.675 --> 06:33.241
These dogs did great today.

06:33.343 --> 06:35.010
They had a lot of fun.

06:35.112 --> 06:39.714
Plenty strong enough, plenty
fast enough, and now they need
to be in the team and just

06:39.817 --> 06:42.951
keep doing this over
and over and over again.

06:43.053 --> 06:45.087
And pretty soon,
they'll be sled dogs.

06:50.861 --> 06:52.527
JESSIE: You only get a
certain amount of time in life.

06:52.596 --> 06:54.996
Why spend it sitting idle?

06:55.299 --> 06:57.666
You only get one shot.

07:06.543 --> 07:11.613
¶ ¶

07:11.815 --> 07:15.417
It's been snowing for
the past week really heavy.

07:15.486 --> 07:20.922
Wet snow around here, and
it's really accumulating deep
and more snow than we usually

07:20.991 --> 07:22.624
get around here.

07:22.693 --> 07:25.760
The last week, we've gotten
nearly two feet of snow.

07:26.763 --> 07:31.900
Gotta start digging
everything out and try to
get this snow out of my way,

07:32.569 --> 07:34.569
so I can actually
function around here.

07:36.173 --> 07:39.741
<i>NARRATOR: For Jessie Holmes,</i>
<i>recent storms have buried</i>
<i>his camp in deep snow.</i>

07:40.644 --> 07:44.312
<i>He must take advantage of a</i>
<i>break in the weather to clear</i>
<i>the snow so he can resume</i>

07:44.381 --> 07:48.049
<i>training his sled dogs</i>
<i>for races, his source</i>
<i>of income in the bush.</i>

07:50.687 --> 07:54.156
-Get cold again here soon,
and none of these jobs are
gonna be that easy to do

07:54.258 --> 07:56.057
in the cold.

07:56.160 --> 07:58.660
'Cause everything
will harden up.

07:58.829 --> 08:02.197
So I was trying to get
this all done before the
cold comes and makes it

08:02.299 --> 08:04.199
twice as difficult.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.903
Just getting my dog food
cooker dug out here.

08:08.605 --> 08:10.972
Dig some fish out of the snow.

08:11.041 --> 08:14.876
Get my dogs' food cooking
up, and then I'm gonna start
digging all the dog houses out

08:14.945 --> 08:18.680
of the snow, and it's coming
to where there's just too much
snow and it's coming right

08:18.749 --> 08:22.584
into the dogs' doors as
they go in with their chain,
the straw's getting wet.

08:23.220 --> 08:26.354
So I need to get these
dog houses all popped
out of the snow.

08:27.724 --> 08:31.059
Now what I gotta do is go
get some hot water, get it in
here, and get a fire going.

08:31.228 --> 08:33.962
While that's heating up
to boiling, I'm gonna
go dig out some fish,

08:34.164 --> 08:36.398
get some fish in there.

08:36.567 --> 08:39.334
I've only got a couple
months of winter left here,
and got a lot of fish that

08:39.436 --> 08:40.535
needs to be cooked up.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.470
The fish saves me
a lot of money.

08:42.539 --> 08:46.074
Maintaining this size of
dog kennel, you spend a
lot of money doing this,

08:46.143 --> 08:47.676
and a lot of
resources doing this.

08:47.744 --> 08:50.645
It's gotta pay back
for itself somehow.

08:52.015 --> 08:53.215
Water heating up.

08:53.317 --> 08:56.518
I'm gonna go get myself seven
to eight fish to put in there.

08:58.622 --> 09:02.624
Right now, I'm just gonna
get myself enough fish to
throw in the dog food cooker.

09:02.926 --> 09:07.062
But once I got the dogs'
houses all busted out, I gotta
come and excavate this whole

09:07.130 --> 09:10.465
pile of fish out, and get it
to where I can easily use it.

09:11.168 --> 09:13.468
'Cause it's not gonna be
efficient for me to come
over here and pop seven

09:13.537 --> 09:15.904
fish out every day.

09:16.106 --> 09:18.406
All right, looks like
my snow thawed out.

09:18.508 --> 09:20.208
My water's warm.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.044
All right, let
that do its magic.

09:23.780 --> 09:26.514
I'm gonna get to popping
these dog houses out.

09:27.618 --> 09:30.118
Right here is what the
problem is, is all this
snow's starting to spill

09:30.187 --> 09:33.355
right into his dog house,
getting way too high.

09:33.423 --> 09:36.424
I'll get your house
fixed for you, buddy.

09:36.593 --> 09:40.962
Running dogs is a lot
of fun, but what it boils
down to is a lot of work.

09:41.298 --> 09:44.966
I'm a little bit behind the
curve right now, but I'm gonna
dig myself out literally.

09:45.202 --> 09:48.603
Dig myself out from the
snowstorm and get things
jumping efficiently

09:49.106 --> 09:51.273
around here again.

09:54.111 --> 09:57.579
Time to get these guys
some dry straw and get 'em
comfortable for the night here,

09:57.681 --> 10:00.081
'cause the temperature
is starting to drop quick.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.616
Good boy, Flash.

10:01.685 --> 10:04.352
Tomorrow's gonna be
a whole 'nother day, it's
gonna be a lot colder out.

10:04.421 --> 10:06.755
It's probably gonna
be pretty hard popping
all those fish loose,

10:06.990 --> 10:11.293
so just get these guys fed,
get myself something in my
belly and rest up for another

10:11.395 --> 10:13.128
hard day out here.

10:14.665 --> 10:16.464
The job's never done.

10:17.167 --> 10:19.501
365 days a year.

10:21.972 --> 10:24.172
GLENN: I just take advantage
of the opportunity,
wherever it comes up.

10:24.241 --> 10:25.707
That's one great thing
about it out here.

10:25.776 --> 10:27.509
I never know what the
day's gonna bring.

10:31.648 --> 10:33.615
The breeze is picking up.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.950
This is just what
I've been waiting for.

10:36.019 --> 10:39.220
Because with this wind,
I'm gonna be able to try
out a new tool I've got.

10:40.490 --> 10:42.324
I'm gonna be able to
try out my paraglider.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.727
What I need to do is practice.

10:45.996 --> 10:48.263
The first step is to try it
out right here on the lake.

10:48.332 --> 10:51.900
I'm gonna take this wing
out on the lake and try
flying it right here first.

10:52.836 --> 10:55.437
Once I get that
mastered, then I'll
head up the mountains.

11:03.380 --> 11:07.248
This winter, I went down
outside Alaska for the
first time in seven years,

11:07.317 --> 11:09.484
in order to study
about paragliding.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.087
And I brought a
paraglider back with me.

11:12.322 --> 11:16.858
A paraglider is something like
a parachute, but it's designed
so that you can take off from

11:16.960 --> 11:18.827
a mountain just by running.

11:18.895 --> 11:22.797
If I can really get this
mastered and learn how to fly
this paraglider well enough,

11:22.866 --> 11:25.767
I'll be able to go
up on the tops of all
these mountains here.

11:25.836 --> 11:29.371
It's gonna open up all
kinds of possibilities.

11:29.439 --> 11:33.708
What might have taken me
two or three hours to walk,
I might be able to fly

11:33.810 --> 11:36.010
in ten minutes.

11:36.079 --> 11:37.579
Gotta make sure I
got this harness on right.

11:37.647 --> 11:39.147
I don't wanna fall out of it.

11:39.216 --> 11:43.017
I wanna get my wing out
and practice flying it
like a kite, right here.

11:43.320 --> 11:46.688
Once you get kiting really
mastered, then you're ready
to actually take to the air.

11:49.860 --> 11:52.193
Whoa, there it goes!

11:52.262 --> 11:54.028
That's a pretty strong gust.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.196
I gotta be careful.

11:55.265 --> 11:57.499
I don't wanna get dragged
all over the place out here.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.404
Whoa, whoa!

12:07.978 --> 12:09.059
Whoa!

12:10.046 --> 12:11.646
GLENN: Whoa!

12:13.383 --> 12:14.849
Whoa!

12:19.289 --> 12:21.122
Woo!

12:25.328 --> 12:28.396
Okay, it's a real challenge.

12:29.132 --> 12:30.732
The wind is strong.

12:30.801 --> 12:34.402
It's a big wind, and
it just dragged me.

12:36.473 --> 12:38.673
There's a lot
going on, though.

12:39.242 --> 12:41.209
Okay, I'm gonna try again.

12:42.579 --> 12:49.117
Whoa, whoa!

12:54.825 --> 12:58.927
(grunting)

12:59.029 --> 13:01.429
It's wild, I was
actually flying.

13:01.498 --> 13:04.532
I took right off the
snow, about a foot high.

13:05.769 --> 13:07.302
It's a lot of fun.

13:07.404 --> 13:08.937
I think I gotta
practice a little more.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.572
I think I'll get
the hang of it.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.607
I just gotta keep trying.

13:13.844 --> 13:15.810
Whoo!

13:15.912 --> 13:18.813
This is primal flight.

13:19.182 --> 13:21.382
Just me and a wing.

13:21.451 --> 13:22.784
Whoa!

13:22.886 --> 13:25.920
When I get this thing
up in the sky, man,
that's gonna be cool.

13:26.923 --> 13:29.057
I'm gonna fly like a bird.

13:29.259 --> 13:32.894
I've been bound right by the
mountains around this valley
for the last several years and

13:32.963 --> 13:34.963
look at all the country
I haven't explored yet.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.297
Whoa!

13:36.399 --> 13:37.465
I'm gonna be free.

13:37.567 --> 13:38.833
I'm gonna head
over the mountains.

13:38.902 --> 13:40.768
I'm gonna climb the peaks,
I'm gonna go explore.

13:40.871 --> 13:42.570
Whoa.

13:42.672 --> 13:45.640
I could shoot a caribou up
on a mountain, throw the meat
in my backpack, and fly home.

13:46.109 --> 13:47.942
Man, why didn't I get
one of these sooner?

13:48.011 --> 13:49.344
Look at this thing,
look at it go!

13:49.446 --> 13:51.446
Woo-hoo-hoo!

13:51.748 --> 13:55.550
Hey, it's up there!

13:55.619 --> 13:57.819
Woo-hoo-hoo, yes, I got it!

13:58.054 --> 14:00.455
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

14:01.224 --> 14:02.590
Whoa.

14:06.029 --> 14:09.063
A lot of fun, but I
think it's time to
pack this thing up.

14:09.232 --> 14:11.032
And I got some good
practice in today.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.534
When the conditions
are right, I'm ready to
head up the mountain.

14:17.707 --> 14:19.340
JESSIE: Death is
nothing to fear.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.009
Not living is
something to fear.

14:21.077 --> 14:24.012
If I were to die tomorrow,
I'm pretty satisfied with
the effort that I've put in.

14:32.422 --> 14:36.257
Yesterday, I got my
dogs' houses all removed,
and next on my project list

14:36.359 --> 14:38.660
is start chipping
all these fish out.

14:38.762 --> 14:40.728
It's never an easy job.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.564
Now, the temperatures
have dropped, we've got a
few more inches of snow,

14:43.667 --> 14:45.833
and then it got cold out, so.

14:45.902 --> 14:49.304
My goal right now is to
get enough of these fish
popped out and stacked up

14:49.372 --> 14:52.540
by my cooker, so I can
easily cook my dog food
over the next month,

14:53.209 --> 14:55.843
so I can save some
time, just focus on
training the dogs.

14:56.913 --> 15:00.581
<i>NARRATOR: Along the Nenana</i>

<i>the fall and summer months</i>

15:00.684 --> 15:02.450
<i>is essential to</i>
<i>Jessie's lifestyle.</i>

15:03.720 --> 15:06.955
<i>The bounty allows him</i>
<i>to feed himself and his</i>
<i>sled dogs year-round.</i>

15:07.357 --> 15:11.326
<i>Exhuming the fish from</i>
<i>the aftermath of recent</i>
<i>storms is a priority.</i>

15:12.262 --> 15:16.230
-If I don't do this, I just
gotta do it every day, you
know, seven fish at a time,

15:16.299 --> 15:18.166
and that efficiency has
not been working for me.

15:18.635 --> 15:21.469
I know I've used close
to a couple thousand
already this year,

15:21.538 --> 15:24.405
so there should be
at least 1,000 here.

15:26.109 --> 15:28.910
You're best off
to just enjoy whatever
task you have at hand,

15:30.981 --> 15:34.682
and look at it as fun and
a challenge instead of,
"Oh God, I gotta do this."

15:37.454 --> 15:40.688
Keeping a positive
attitude has been what's
led me to success in living

15:40.757 --> 15:42.290
the way I'm living.

15:42.392 --> 15:46.327
That's just the life I love
living, and I enjoy the
cold, and I enjoy all the

15:46.429 --> 15:49.230
difficulties that come
along living up here.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.367
This gives me something
that engages me every day.

15:52.602 --> 15:54.068
There's always
work to be done.

15:54.137 --> 15:56.170
Out here, I'm working for
myself, not for somebody else.

15:56.639 --> 16:00.174
I'm working towards my
own goals, not making
somebody else money.

16:01.945 --> 16:03.878
Got myself a nice pile here.

16:03.947 --> 16:06.647
Next step for me is getting
it over by my dog food cooker.

16:09.519 --> 16:10.852
All right, ready?

16:10.954 --> 16:12.020
Let's go, hike!

16:12.122 --> 16:14.389
All right, hike!

16:23.433 --> 16:24.966
All right, tighten up.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.934
All right, straight.

16:27.003 --> 16:28.736
Stay.

16:31.041 --> 16:34.308
Some people wake up
and think they wanna be
on a beach in Hawaii.

16:34.377 --> 16:38.079
Well, if I was on a beach
in Hawaii, I'd wake up and
think, I wanna be in Alaska,

16:38.181 --> 16:39.313
running dogs.

16:39.382 --> 16:40.448
All right, ready?

16:40.517 --> 16:42.417
Hike, straight up, hike, good.

16:44.054 --> 16:47.021
First time I was ever
out in the wilderness on a
dog team, I knew right away

16:47.090 --> 16:49.657
that that's what
I wanted in life.

16:49.726 --> 16:52.727
I wanted it to be something
that was my lifestyle,
not just something to do.

16:53.029 --> 16:54.095
You know?

16:54.197 --> 16:55.596
Not a hobby.

16:55.698 --> 16:58.332
To where I can be out
here doing what I want
and working for myself.

16:59.002 --> 17:02.170
We work hard for what we
love, to do what we wanna do.

17:02.238 --> 17:05.873
This hard work equals
me running dogs, so
it's no problem to me.

17:07.243 --> 17:10.044
It just depends on if you're
doing what you love or not.

17:10.246 --> 17:11.746
I put in a good,
honest effort here.

17:11.815 --> 17:14.215
Got a lot of fish, got
more than I planned on.

17:14.250 --> 17:18.553
This is gonna last my dogs for
at least six weeks, you know,
and that's the main priority

17:18.788 --> 17:20.154
around here, is the dogs.

17:20.256 --> 17:24.158
Everything I do goes
around full-circle and
comes back to the dogs.

17:27.263 --> 17:28.963
ANDY: I love
experiencing life.

17:29.065 --> 17:30.531
I love experiencing
new things.

17:30.633 --> 17:31.966
I love experimenting.

17:32.068 --> 17:34.335
And if I can do that,
I'm a happy person.

17:41.177 --> 17:42.276
It's fish time!

17:42.345 --> 17:44.145
You guys ready for your fish?

17:44.214 --> 17:47.682
<i>NARRATOR: In Eagle, Andy</i>
<i>is training his two puppies</i>
<i>to become working members</i>

17:47.784 --> 17:49.584
<i>of his sled team.</i>

17:49.652 --> 17:53.488
<i>Getting the dogs adapted</i>
<i>to their new surroundings</i>
<i>is essential, and tonight,</i>

17:53.590 --> 17:55.723
<i>they face their</i>
<i>biggest challenge yet.</i>

17:58.828 --> 18:01.662
-So I got a big night
for the puppies tonight.

18:01.731 --> 18:05.032
It's gonna be their
first night getting
a collar put on 'em.

18:06.002 --> 18:10.138
And their first night,
hopefully, spending a
night over in the dog lot

18:10.240 --> 18:12.840
in their own house.

18:13.176 --> 18:16.744
And what they need
to learn now is they need to
learn what it means to have a

18:16.846 --> 18:18.412
collar on them.

18:18.515 --> 18:21.716
They've never had a collar
on, pulling on their neck.

18:21.751 --> 18:24.886
And that's a hard thing
for a puppy that's been free
their whole life to deal with.

18:26.422 --> 18:27.855
All right, puppy,
puppy, puppy.

18:27.924 --> 18:29.524
Ready for your fish?

18:29.592 --> 18:31.659
We're gonna get a fish-fish!

18:31.761 --> 18:32.560
Yes, we are.

18:32.629 --> 18:33.961
We're gonna get a fish-fish.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.229
Ready for your collar?

18:35.331 --> 18:37.365
Let's see how you
do with a collar on.

18:37.467 --> 18:38.499
Look at you, Geo.

18:38.568 --> 18:40.334
You're like a real dog now!

18:40.403 --> 18:43.471
Naty says, "Me too, me too,
put a collar on me too."

18:43.940 --> 18:45.907
Okay, you got a collar too!

18:46.009 --> 18:48.476
Good girl, let's
go get a fish-fish.

18:49.445 --> 18:53.080
Geo says, I know what to do.

18:53.183 --> 18:56.250
All right, come on, come on!

18:57.420 --> 19:00.221
That'a girl, yeah.

19:00.423 --> 19:01.522
You're a good girl.

19:01.591 --> 19:03.324
Oh, you're handling
this pretty good.

19:03.393 --> 19:04.859
I thought you'd
fight this more.

19:04.928 --> 19:06.327
You're doing a good job.

19:06.396 --> 19:07.662
Come here, G!

19:07.730 --> 19:08.863
Come on, big buy!

19:08.965 --> 19:12.133
Come on, yay, look at you.

19:13.169 --> 19:15.303
You got swagger butt.

19:15.371 --> 19:16.871
Good boy.

19:16.940 --> 19:18.406
Let's put this chain on.

19:18.474 --> 19:22.043
Yay, let's get you a fish!

19:23.613 --> 19:24.979
So far they're
doing pretty good.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.180
I can see Naty...

19:26.249 --> 19:28.082
she's kind of at the
end of her chain there.

19:28.151 --> 19:30.985
And it takes 'em
a while to figure out how
to manipulate the chain

19:31.054 --> 19:32.820
around the, the post.

19:32.889 --> 19:35.456
And just how
to step over it and not
get tangled up in it.

19:36.459 --> 19:38.159
But that just takes time.

19:38.261 --> 19:39.360
Come here, Naty.

19:39.462 --> 19:40.695
Fish-fish?

19:40.797 --> 19:42.563
Oh, look at that.

19:42.665 --> 19:44.165
You got fish-fish.

19:44.467 --> 19:46.033
Can you sit, Naty?

19:46.102 --> 19:49.537
Sit, good girl, good girl!

19:49.639 --> 19:50.738
There's a fish.

19:50.807 --> 19:52.373
Good girl.

19:52.475 --> 19:53.307
Hey, G-man.

19:53.409 --> 19:54.642
You ready for your fish?

19:54.744 --> 19:56.677
Yeah, can you sit?

19:58.581 --> 20:00.581
Okay, Good job!

20:00.683 --> 20:03.117
There's a fish, yay!

20:03.186 --> 20:05.453
Be a sled dog and eat a
fish with the big boys.

20:06.322 --> 20:09.156
I'm really surprised
that they're not fighting
that chain harder.

20:09.492 --> 20:13.894
I've had dogs that
fought the chain for 12
hours, just freaking out,

20:14.197 --> 20:15.763
not liking it at all.

20:15.865 --> 20:19.400
And these guys are
handling it really well, so I
think the timing's pretty good

20:19.602 --> 20:23.004
right now for, for them to
become a part of this kennel.

20:24.607 --> 20:27.775
So that makes me feel good,
'cause I want it to be a good
experience for them, too.

20:28.878 --> 20:31.512
And I'm real excited
because this is my future.

20:38.221 --> 20:40.988
AGNES: It's a healthy
living and we also enjoy it.

20:48.564 --> 20:51.098
So, this is the snow machine
that broke down earlier.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.634
You can tell it's
not going no place.

20:54.037 --> 20:55.770
You can't even
pull or nothing.

20:55.872 --> 20:57.705
It's totally seized.

20:57.807 --> 20:59.807
There's no moving it.

21:00.043 --> 21:04.879
Ting and I broke down a mile
out of town and we walked back
to town and got on the VHF and

21:04.947 --> 21:09.984
asked on the VHF if anybody
was willing to go haul
our sled and bring our snow

21:10.253 --> 21:14.522
machine back, so one of the
neighbors did and now we have
the snow machine in the yard.

21:15.825 --> 21:19.460
<i>NARRATOR: With winter</i>
<i>nearing its end, the Hailstones</i>
<i>must prepare for spring</i>

21:19.529 --> 21:21.295
<i>and summer hunts.</i>

21:21.364 --> 21:25.966
<i>They will travel 120 miles to</i>
<i>Kiwalik, and retrieve their</i>
<i>teepee for needed repairs.</i>

21:26.969 --> 21:30.071
<i>But a broken snow</i>
<i>machine has forced Agnes</i>
<i>to come up with an alternative</i>

21:30.173 --> 21:32.073
<i>plan for the journey.</i>

21:32.175 --> 21:33.307
-Froze.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.109
It's not going anywhere.

21:35.178 --> 21:38.279
I'm not even gonna
take the time to repair
this snow machine.

21:38.981 --> 21:41.349
I'm just gonna take Chip's
snow machine and use that.

21:43.986 --> 21:46.287
I don't really know what
the condition Chip left
his snow machine in.

21:46.823 --> 21:49.290
Hopefully, nothing's
really wrong with it.

21:49.692 --> 21:53.461
I haven't touched it, the
girls haven't touched it since
he left, and so hopefully,

21:53.529 --> 21:55.896
it'll start right up.

21:56.566 --> 21:58.933
Spark plugs are
on, so that's good.

22:02.205 --> 22:06.307
You can see there's no
belt on the snow machine.

22:06.476 --> 22:09.643
He probably purposefully
took the belt off, just so
it wouldn't go anywhere.

22:10.947 --> 22:14.782
I'm gonna just take the spare
belt off the snow machine that
broke down and get this snow

22:14.851 --> 22:17.818
machine started and
continue on with my trip.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.224
Getting kind of dark here.

22:23.326 --> 22:26.594
Usually, Chip's the
one who goes out and repairs
all this stuff and tows

22:26.696 --> 22:29.196
whatever needs towing.

22:29.632 --> 22:33.367
I have at least an idea
how to put a belt on,
or change a spark plug,

22:33.970 --> 22:39.173
or make sure you have all your
details on your snow machine
up to par and there we go.

22:40.042 --> 22:43.377
Once you have all
the little details, it
usually runs pretty good.

22:44.147 --> 22:49.016
So all I pretty much gotta
do is start pulling on it,
and it's fairly warm out.

22:50.820 --> 22:52.987
Hopefully it should
start right up.

22:54.924 --> 22:57.691
Okay, here's the
moment of truth.

22:59.862 --> 23:01.162
Ah, come on.

23:01.264 --> 23:05.399
(engine stalling)

23:05.868 --> 23:07.635
Yay!

23:07.737 --> 23:10.404
Yee, yee, yee!

23:11.040 --> 23:13.340
Looks like we're
going on a trip.

23:23.453 --> 23:25.519
¶ ¶

23:25.621 --> 23:26.887
Beautiful day.

23:26.956 --> 23:29.957
Oh, my goodness.

23:38.134 --> 23:40.501
There should be no problems
with this snow machine.

23:40.570 --> 23:42.903
I haven't used it all winter,
but it should be running good.

23:45.875 --> 23:49.477
We really need to get down
to Kiwalik and pick up the
sled with the teepee in it.

23:49.979 --> 23:53.848
I definitely need to do
some repairs to the teepee
before this next summer.

24:02.458 --> 24:06.293
¶ ¶

24:06.362 --> 24:10.064
I like to stop before
I get into the ocean and look
around and see what's going on

24:10.166 --> 24:12.666
in the area.

24:13.336 --> 24:15.769
Oh, no.

24:17.039 --> 24:19.607
You could see a pressure
ridge out there.

24:21.911 --> 24:26.680
It's pretty much just ice
going up and back, when the
ocean tide comes up and down.

24:27.116 --> 24:29.717
Even though it's frozen,
there's still water
moving under there,

24:29.952 --> 24:32.453
and it's still breathing,
what we call it.

24:32.755 --> 24:35.189
-We'll have to walk on,
walk, walk it both sides?

24:35.458 --> 24:38.125
-Yeah, we'll just walk
up to it and check, make
sure there's no water,

24:38.194 --> 24:41.428
and then if there's water,
we'll just have to find
a place to go around it.

24:45.201 --> 24:48.269
It's pretty dangerous
when you try to go
over pressure ridges.

24:48.337 --> 24:51.005
You have to keep
your eyes open.

24:53.509 --> 24:57.411
There's people who died out
there, people who's crashed
and hurt and bumped a pressure

24:57.480 --> 25:01.048
ridge trying to fly from
one side to the other without
really looking how far it is.

25:01.784 --> 25:04.618
All kinds of stuff
happen out here.

25:10.159 --> 25:11.559
So all these pressure ridges.

25:17.700 --> 25:19.082
Oh, my God.

25:23.173 --> 25:24.939
AGNES: Oh, my God.

25:29.279 --> 25:31.045
Go look.

25:37.187 --> 25:39.921
Crack there, but we
can go right over it.

25:40.423 --> 25:42.390
Right there.

25:42.458 --> 25:46.394
What you're looking for is
if it's too far wide apart,
that your snow machine

25:46.496 --> 25:48.095
will just fall right in.

25:48.164 --> 25:50.431
Or if there's
water or overflow.

25:50.934 --> 25:52.066
There's no water.

25:52.168 --> 25:53.701
The crack is not as big.

25:53.803 --> 25:57.471
So it's safe to cross,
so we're just gonna go get
back on our snow machine and

25:57.574 --> 26:00.007
just cross right here,
and carry on.

26:01.344 --> 26:03.144
Carry on.

26:07.150 --> 26:09.350
Hold on!

26:12.722 --> 26:14.555
Yee.

26:24.734 --> 26:30.304
¶ ¶

26:31.040 --> 26:34.108
Good, we made it!

26:38.581 --> 26:40.815
It's good to see that
the sled is still here.

26:40.884 --> 26:44.385
And inside the sled,
there's the teepee and the
stuff that we need to get

26:44.454 --> 26:47.121
repaired in Noorvik.

26:49.192 --> 26:52.727
So we're just gonna
take the basket sled off,
put this freight sled on

26:52.795 --> 26:55.096
because it's gonna be
a bigger, heavier load.

26:55.198 --> 26:56.163
Ready, Ting?

26:56.232 --> 26:58.699
You'll just push.

27:03.239 --> 27:05.539
-Now we just gotta
tie this one down.

27:05.875 --> 27:07.008
-That should work.

27:07.110 --> 27:09.677
-Hopefully it'll last
the 120 miles back home.

27:09.746 --> 27:11.078
-Yeah, we gotta start going.

27:11.147 --> 27:13.047
It's starting to
get windy and dark.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.086
Ready then?

27:19.188 --> 27:22.857
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay, no stopping.

27:38.408 --> 27:39.974
ANDY: Experience is knowledge.

27:40.076 --> 27:41.375
Knowledge is confidence.

27:41.444 --> 27:44.912
Confidence is success and they
all go together in that order.

27:53.623 --> 27:57.725
¶ ¶

27:57.794 --> 28:01.395
Today, I'm gonna take
a small team of dogs
out, just three adults.

28:01.464 --> 28:03.397
Puppies are gonna
be running behind.

28:03.466 --> 28:08.602
I want to hook my puppies in
to the actual team, and see
what they're gonna do pulling

28:08.705 --> 28:10.304
the sled, running.

28:10.406 --> 28:13.874
See if they balk at all,
if they fight the neckline.

28:14.043 --> 28:17.011
<i>NARRATOR: Andy's puppies are</i>
<i>entering the most critical</i>
<i>phase of their training,</i>

28:17.113 --> 28:19.380
<i>running in line as</i>
<i>part of the sled team.</i>

28:20.350 --> 28:25.286
<i>But the safety of the dogs is</i>
<i>vital, and for now, Andy must</i>
<i>take precautions to ensure the</i>

28:25.388 --> 28:28.389
<i>young dogs can handle the</i>
<i>raw power of the team.</i>

28:29.959 --> 28:31.258
ANDY: It's a big day.

28:31.327 --> 28:34.195
First day ever for
them to actually be
in front of a sled,

28:34.263 --> 28:36.497
pulling a sled
with the big dogs.

28:36.799 --> 28:40.968
They took to getting on
the chain and being in
the dog lot really well,

28:41.137 --> 28:42.803
much better than I expected.

28:42.872 --> 28:45.706
That's an indicator that
they're ready, maybe,
to go into the team.

28:46.142 --> 28:48.242
So today's the big test.

28:49.345 --> 28:51.112
Are you guys ready
to go for a run?

28:51.214 --> 28:52.613
Look at this!

28:52.682 --> 28:53.547
Oh, boy.

28:53.649 --> 28:54.648
Here comes a harness.

28:54.751 --> 28:56.017
We're going for a run!

28:56.085 --> 28:57.218
All right!

28:57.320 --> 28:59.420
Naty's ready to go for a run.

28:59.489 --> 29:01.422
I don't have to really
teach him too much.

29:01.491 --> 29:05.059
I just have to get him into
the team next to some dogs
that are gonna teach him.

29:05.862 --> 29:08.129
I'm gonna be a sled dog today!

29:08.231 --> 29:10.364
Because I like pulling sleds!

29:10.466 --> 29:12.133
I think I'll take
Iceberg loose today.

29:12.201 --> 29:15.202
I'll cut him loose, and
if he wants to follow us
and have some fun with us,

29:15.304 --> 29:17.271
he can do that today, too.

29:17.373 --> 29:18.406
Okay, let's go.

29:18.508 --> 29:19.407
Hup, hup.

29:19.475 --> 29:21.409
Come on Iceberg,
come on, buddy.

29:21.611 --> 29:23.911
I think Iceberg is to
the point where he's
gonna get retired now.

29:24.614 --> 29:27.415
It's time to go out with the
old, and bring in the new.

29:28.785 --> 29:30.551
Yeah, all right, let's go!

29:34.223 --> 29:35.256
All right, Krugy.

29:35.358 --> 29:36.457
We're gonna go haw.

29:36.559 --> 29:37.792
Haw, haw.

29:37.860 --> 29:39.427
They have to
learn to trust me.

29:39.529 --> 29:43.297
And I have to be very,
very careful that I don't try
and make them do something

29:43.399 --> 29:44.965
they're not ready for.

29:45.068 --> 29:48.836
And if I can do that,
and they can do their part,
then it's a team and I'm the

29:48.938 --> 29:51.105
leader of the pack.

29:53.009 --> 29:54.008
All right, Krugy.

29:54.077 --> 29:55.142
Let's go over to the edge.

29:55.244 --> 29:56.544
There you go, buddy.

29:56.646 --> 29:57.878
Good boy!

29:57.980 --> 29:59.113
That was good, Krug.

29:59.182 --> 30:01.115
Come on, Bergy.

30:01.184 --> 30:02.683
Puppers are doing a good job!

30:02.752 --> 30:04.018
Good boy, Foge.

30:04.087 --> 30:05.553
Everybody, come!

30:05.655 --> 30:06.720
Everybody, come!

30:06.823 --> 30:08.856
Come on, Naty.

30:08.958 --> 30:11.192
You're pretty independent
little crapper, aren't ya?

30:11.527 --> 30:13.727
Come on Naty, come on
Geo, come on, Berg.

30:13.963 --> 30:16.697
Iceberg come, Iceberg, come.

30:16.899 --> 30:18.032
I'm gonna take off.

30:18.134 --> 30:19.900
They'll follow us.

30:20.103 --> 30:22.203
Everybody, let's go!

30:24.841 --> 30:26.340
That'a boys!

30:26.409 --> 30:29.210
I've just gotta be smarter
than the damn puppies.

30:29.378 --> 30:31.946
Yay Naty, yay Geo!

30:32.148 --> 30:33.948
Come on, boys, let's
go over to the edge.

30:34.050 --> 30:35.082
There you go, buddy.

30:35.184 --> 30:38.752
Good boy, all right!

30:39.555 --> 30:42.656
Yay, puppers, yay
Naty, yay Naty!

30:43.759 --> 30:46.060
Good girl, yay, Naty!

30:46.462 --> 30:48.729
You're gonna be with this
big old guy right here.

30:48.831 --> 30:51.665
Big old Shilling's
gonna teach you how to
be a sled dog now, Naty.

30:52.135 --> 30:53.968
You guys gonna be sled dogs?

30:54.036 --> 30:58.873
Okay well, the puppies are
in the team, and we're gonna
see if they're gonna do

30:58.975 --> 31:00.474
this or not right now.

31:00.576 --> 31:03.077
And uh, so this is a
big moment for them.

31:03.179 --> 31:04.812
Big moment for me.

31:05.148 --> 31:06.113
Let's do it!

31:06.182 --> 31:07.414
Hup, hup, that'a boys.

31:07.483 --> 31:09.917
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
good girl, Naty!

31:09.986 --> 31:13.254
Good girl Naty, good girl
Naty, good girl Naty!

31:14.290 --> 31:17.725
Yay, Geo, good boys!

31:19.862 --> 31:23.564
Okay Naty, good boy, Geo.

31:23.666 --> 31:25.833
All right, good puppers.

31:25.902 --> 31:28.469
I'm really excited about
how well they're doing.

31:28.538 --> 31:31.338
They're doing exceptionally
well for their first time out.

31:31.440 --> 31:34.542
All right, whoa, good boy!

31:35.378 --> 31:38.679
You're a good boy,
you're a sled dog, Geo!

31:38.881 --> 31:40.848
G probably handled
everything the best.

31:40.917 --> 31:44.285
I notice with his personality,
he's very happy-go-lucky.

31:44.353 --> 31:45.953
He's very trusting.

31:46.022 --> 31:47.254
He's a very loyal dog.

31:47.323 --> 31:49.423
Naty's a very intelligent dog.

31:49.492 --> 31:53.661
She's constantly looking
and analyzing at everything
that goes on around her.

31:53.763 --> 31:55.262
I'm feeling really
good about this.

31:55.364 --> 31:56.530
They're having fun.

31:56.632 --> 31:58.632
And that's what
it's all about.

31:58.701 --> 32:01.535
You know, it's been
a long time since I've
had some young puppies,

32:01.604 --> 32:05.773
and I forgot how much fun it
was to have young puppies,
and have them in my life.

32:06.108 --> 32:10.044
Most importantly, what
I really missed was being able
to take a young puppy and mold

32:10.146 --> 32:12.513
'em into what I want them
to be for a sled dog.

32:12.615 --> 32:14.949
Oh, boy!

32:21.224 --> 32:24.858
GLENN: When you're using
your knowledge and your
skills to get a job done,

32:25.127 --> 32:26.961
it's satisfying.

32:33.436 --> 32:35.436
This could be the day.

32:35.538 --> 32:37.805
The wind's calm right now.

32:37.873 --> 32:40.641
I think this could be the day
that I go fly this paraglider.

32:41.377 --> 32:43.043
I'm gonna head right up
the mountain right here.

32:43.112 --> 32:46.447
Hopefully when I get
to the top of the ridge,
conditions will be good.

32:46.515 --> 32:50.251
And I should be able to fly
right back down to my camp,
in just five or ten minutes.

32:50.753 --> 32:52.386
I'll be back on the ground.

32:52.488 --> 32:56.323
<i>NARRATOR: Glenn has recently</i>
<i>acquired a paraglider,</i>
<i>a device that if mastered,</i>

32:57.159 --> 32:59.560
<i>will increase his mobility</i>
<i>in the Brooks Range.</i>

33:00.196 --> 33:04.198
<i>After testing the wing</i>
<i>on the lake, Glenn will now</i>
<i>attempt his first flight from</i>

33:04.267 --> 33:07.835
<i>a nearby ridge, over</i>
<i>3,700 feet above sea level.</i>

33:11.140 --> 33:12.072
-Right there!

33:12.174 --> 33:13.474
That's the ridge top.

33:13.576 --> 33:15.809
That's where I wanna
fly off of, right up
on top of that ridge.

33:16.779 --> 33:17.745
It's pretty cold.

33:17.847 --> 33:19.446
32 below zero.

33:19.515 --> 33:20.981
But the conditions are good.

33:21.050 --> 33:25.352
If it's like this, nice
and calm when I get up on
top, I'll be able to fly.

33:30.526 --> 33:34.128
I've spent years and years
and years walking this country,
walking these mountains,

33:34.697 --> 33:37.131
paddling these lakes,
paddling these rivers.

33:37.233 --> 33:39.700
I wanna fly this sky.

33:42.672 --> 33:46.240
The main thing I'm
thinking about on my way down,
I've got to make sure I get

33:46.342 --> 33:47.941
over all these trees.

33:48.044 --> 33:49.677
I wanna land out
there on the lake.

33:49.745 --> 33:52.946
If I land in the trees,
it'd be a big problem.

33:54.116 --> 33:56.784
I'm almost at the top.

34:02.425 --> 34:05.025
Yeah, I'm a long ways up.

34:05.828 --> 34:10.597
I've probably stood
at this spot 100 times, but
it never felt quite like

34:10.866 --> 34:13.067
it does right now.

34:15.604 --> 34:18.405
Definitely want everything
right before I take off.

34:18.607 --> 34:20.974
I just got to get all
my ducks in a row.

34:21.043 --> 34:23.444
I got to make sure that
my lines aren't tangled up,

34:23.546 --> 34:25.512
make sure the wing's
in the right position.

34:25.581 --> 34:28.949
Got to make sure everything's
clipped in right.

34:30.686 --> 34:34.321
Okay, I'm gonna try and
get this wing in the air.

34:35.391 --> 34:37.758
Whoo!

34:37.827 --> 34:40.160
This is gonna be
incredible if it works.

34:40.262 --> 34:42.029
I'm a little bit nervous.

34:42.131 --> 34:43.964
It's a long way
back down to camp.

34:44.033 --> 34:47.101
You got to take a
chance sometimes.

34:50.272 --> 34:51.771
GLENN: Whoo!

34:51.840 --> 34:53.573
I'm gonna try and get
this wing in the air.

34:53.675 --> 34:55.942
This is gonna be
incredible if it works.

34:56.011 --> 34:57.577
I'm a little bit nervous.

34:57.646 --> 34:59.346
It's a long way
back down to camp.

34:59.448 --> 35:01.781
You got to take a
chance sometimes.

35:05.687 --> 35:07.187
Woo-hoo-hoo!

35:07.289 --> 35:09.055
I'm flying!

35:09.157 --> 35:11.591
Woo-hoo!

35:11.693 --> 35:13.360
Look at that, I'm flying!

35:13.428 --> 35:16.129
Woo-hoo-hoo!

35:16.198 --> 35:17.697
Wooo!

35:17.766 --> 35:19.065
Paragliding, it's
something new.

35:19.134 --> 35:20.767
I love it.

35:20.869 --> 35:22.802
It's very important to try
new techniques and activities,
because it's a question of

35:22.905 --> 35:23.970
mental health.

35:24.039 --> 35:27.007
If you don't do something
new, you're gonna stagnate.

35:27.109 --> 35:29.910
Look at the view.

35:30.112 --> 35:32.512
The sun's setting over there.

35:32.581 --> 35:35.382
And the moon's
right behind me.

35:35.450 --> 35:37.284
I've been dreaming
about this for so long.

35:38.420 --> 35:41.988
This is incredible.

35:42.090 --> 35:44.057
I'm not putting
limitations on myself.

35:44.126 --> 35:47.093
I'm giving
myself possibilities to
explore things done in

35:47.162 --> 35:48.428
a different way.

35:48.497 --> 35:51.364
I wanna experience
something different.

35:55.037 --> 35:57.971
I just don't wanna
end up in these trees.

36:01.944 --> 36:03.810
Okay.

36:09.151 --> 36:10.617
Whoo!

36:10.686 --> 36:13.153
There, just made
it over that.

36:18.727 --> 36:21.027
Woo-hoo-hoo, awesome!

36:21.863 --> 36:23.129
I made it right to my camp.

36:23.231 --> 36:25.098
That was incredible.

36:25.167 --> 36:27.534
That was a fast trip
down the mountain!

36:27.636 --> 36:30.070
All the way down here
in less than 10 minutes.

36:30.172 --> 36:31.705
Amazing.

36:31.807 --> 36:33.907
Kind of afraid for
a minute there.

36:33.976 --> 36:36.643
I had to do some turns down
here, and I got a little low.

36:36.712 --> 36:38.645
And then I was a little
worried I got too low.

36:38.714 --> 36:40.246
I came in over
the trees there.

36:40.349 --> 36:43.183
Luckily, I still had enough
altitude, and landed right
here in my front yard.

36:44.219 --> 36:45.618
Flying's the way to go.

36:45.687 --> 36:47.721
No motor, no gas, no
complicated maintenance.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.390
Just a fabric wing and
you can fly like an eagle.

36:53.061 --> 36:54.361
That was amazing.

36:54.463 --> 36:57.063
But the real highlights
of this year, I
got a beautiful moose,

36:57.132 --> 36:59.199
called it right in close
to me during the rut.

36:59.301 --> 37:00.800
(gunshot)

37:00.902 --> 37:02.602
That was exciting.

37:02.704 --> 37:04.037
I got a bunch of ice.

37:04.139 --> 37:05.805
Argh, I got it!

37:05.874 --> 37:06.940
Yeah!

37:07.075 --> 37:10.477
And packed in to that
refrigerator hole real tight.

37:10.746 --> 37:12.979
I saw a super moon one night.

37:13.081 --> 37:15.415
Closer to the earth
than it normally is,
it was incredible.

37:17.019 --> 37:20.820
I survived a night at
44 below zero.

37:21.089 --> 37:23.757
Still got all my fingers,
still got all my toes.

37:24.793 --> 37:28.361
And this winter, for the
first time ever in my
life, I built an igloo.

37:30.032 --> 37:33.433
To top it all off,
the best part, I learned
to fly a paraglider.

37:34.236 --> 37:38.304
And I'll tell you, when
I get this thing mastered,
the sky's gonna be the limit.

37:43.478 --> 37:45.779
JESSIE: There's never an
easy day in the dog yard.

37:45.881 --> 37:46.913
It's all work.

37:46.982 --> 37:49.349
But it's a rewarding life.

37:58.026 --> 37:59.993
This roof is old,
this cabin's old.

38:00.062 --> 38:02.729
I can't afford to have my
roof just collapse on me.

38:03.565 --> 38:08.134
I just got to be preventative
and get the snow off the
roof, and prevent a lot of ice

38:08.236 --> 38:10.804
build-up, and problems
in the future.

38:20.682 --> 38:25.251
¶ ¶

38:25.320 --> 38:27.687
This has been the best
winter of my life so far.

38:27.756 --> 38:31.491
I've been up here doing
this for many years, and
I'm getting better at it,

38:31.560 --> 38:36.563
so I was way more ahead
on proficiently catching
plenty of fish for my dogs.

38:38.500 --> 38:42.001
I got a new sawmill
set up now, that I can
mill up my own lumber.

38:42.871 --> 38:46.806
Went out on some amazing
camping trips in the Alaska
Range, saw some new country.

38:47.843 --> 38:51.978
I've been able to get
really good training on
the dogs early this year,

38:52.080 --> 38:53.780
and figured a lot
of things out.

38:53.882 --> 38:58.118
I come out on my first race
of the season, and I won it
with an incredibly fast time.

39:02.424 --> 39:06.893
All right, I did what I
got to do up here, get a,
I probably got, you know,

39:06.962 --> 39:10.730
couple thousand pounds
of weight off of my roof
that my roof probably wasn't

39:10.832 --> 39:12.532
gonna be able to sustain.

39:12.601 --> 39:16.002
Now, I'm gonna get on
to get the dogs hooked up
and get out on the trail,

39:16.204 --> 39:18.271
and get some running in.

39:21.643 --> 39:23.042
We're about to go
have a good time!

39:23.145 --> 39:24.844
All right, boys.

39:26.148 --> 39:27.847
This has been an
awesome winter for me.

39:27.916 --> 39:31.351
I've accomplished a lot, and
I'm just looking forward to
getting better in the future.

39:31.753 --> 39:34.420
Right now, I am on
to the next goals.

39:34.856 --> 39:40.160
I've accomplished a lot, but
that just gives me motivation
and drive to continue on and

39:40.228 --> 39:42.495
to keep setting higher
goals, and higher standards.

39:43.431 --> 39:45.165
The future's wide open for me.

39:45.233 --> 39:49.602
I've proven that my hard work
will pay off, and if I just
keep being humble and working

39:49.671 --> 39:53.940
hard, and staying true to
who I am, I'm just gonna
keep gaining ground.

39:55.210 --> 39:57.143
Straight ahead.

40:01.116 --> 40:03.316
ANDY: If you
wanna be independent, you
got to be independent in all

40:03.418 --> 40:04.918
aspects of life.

40:04.986 --> 40:07.453
You got to suck it up and
do what you got to do.

40:17.265 --> 40:21.167
I'm taking my puppies out
on their first camping trip.

40:21.903 --> 40:25.605
I'm expecting temperatures
to be pretty cold, but
that's the way it goes.

40:26.675 --> 40:29.542
<i>NARRATOR: After days</i>
<i>of practice with the</i>
<i>veteran sled dogs,</i>

40:29.611 --> 40:33.880
<i>Andy's puppies are ready for</i>
<i>their final test, an overnight</i>
<i>journey into the wilderness.</i>

40:34.549 --> 40:37.917
<i>If they perform well, they</i>
<i>will complete their training</i>
<i>and become full-fledged</i>

40:37.986 --> 40:40.486
<i>members of Andy's dog team.</i>

40:40.722 --> 40:44.824
-I really don't wanna hook
up the puppies to an 11-dog
team leaving the yard.

40:44.993 --> 40:48.494
It's way too fast, way
too much power, really
scary for the puppies,

40:49.130 --> 40:53.433
so I'm just leaving 'em
loose until the big team
of dogs settles down,

40:53.668 --> 40:57.704
and then I clip
those puppies in when things
settle down and they can be

40:57.806 --> 41:00.173
a part of the team.

41:03.345 --> 41:04.444
Hup!

41:04.546 --> 41:06.613
Let's go!

41:06.681 --> 41:10.250
I work really hard to try
and have good discipline
with my dog team.

41:10.318 --> 41:14.053
I work really hard to
make it to where it's
easy to deal with them.

41:14.623 --> 41:15.655
Straight ahead, on by.

41:15.757 --> 41:17.757
Hup, hup, whoa.

41:17.826 --> 41:22.662
Oh, I'm gonna clip these
puppies in now, and head up
through a woods trail

41:23.064 --> 41:24.497
for a while.

41:24.599 --> 41:27.066
We'll adjust the speed of
the team to the puppies,
not the other way around.

41:28.203 --> 41:32.272
I'm trying to
put the puppies next to
mature, easy to handle,

41:32.340 --> 41:36.276
well-behaved adult
dogs so that they learn that
behavior directly from them.

41:39.214 --> 41:40.513
That'a boys, hup, hup, hup!

41:40.615 --> 41:42.849
Let's go, hup, hup, on by.

41:43.151 --> 41:47.220
I don't wanna put 'em next to
screaming psycho dogs because
I don't want them to think

41:47.289 --> 41:49.889
that that's what
they're supposed to do.

41:50.659 --> 41:54.560
I have noticed that sled dogs
love to go on adventures,
and they like camping out,

41:55.196 --> 41:56.863
and they like
going new places.

41:56.931 --> 42:00.366
So it's a nice valley,
it's a comfortable
place for me to camp,

42:00.435 --> 42:03.036
it'll be a fun place
for the dogs to camp.

42:03.104 --> 42:05.605
It's just gonna be
a great place for them to
have their first experience

42:05.674 --> 42:07.440
going out camping.

42:08.443 --> 42:10.877
That'a boys!

42:13.181 --> 42:15.581
Haw, whoa!

42:16.851 --> 42:19.319
Yay Geo, yay G-man!

42:21.423 --> 42:22.922
Puppies did great.

42:23.024 --> 42:25.591
Once I clicked 'em into
the team here, they were
keeping up pretty good and,

42:25.694 --> 42:27.093
and having fun.

42:27.162 --> 42:29.996
It's a good night for a first
camping trip for the dogs.

42:36.338 --> 42:40.406
This last period time, getting
the puppies all introduced
into the, the dog lot,

42:40.842 --> 42:44.077
introducing them to
their collars and
within a day or so,

42:44.145 --> 42:49.248
putting a harness on and
having 'em follow, what really
surprised me today was running

42:49.317 --> 42:53.986
'em in a, in a 11-dog team
like this, that's extremely
rare for puppies this young,

42:55.256 --> 42:56.756
to be able to handle that.

42:56.825 --> 43:00.660
Transition from being a
puppy to being a sled dog
has gone extremely well.

43:02.430 --> 43:04.530
This is what being a
sled dog's all about.

43:04.599 --> 43:08.534
Busting trail, exploring
the country, camping out.

43:11.072 --> 43:15.408
Dogs are meant to live in the
wild, and some people are too.

43:17.112 --> 43:18.811
All in all, it's
been a good year.

43:18.880 --> 43:22.148
Freedom and independence is
probably the two things that
are most important in my life,

43:22.684 --> 43:27.320
and I feel like I have that,
not only through my food, but
also through my power and in

43:27.422 --> 43:29.422
my transportation now.

43:33.027 --> 43:36.262
With new batteries,
I'm back to being gas
and diesel-free again.

43:38.400 --> 43:41.334
I really love getting
out on Ford Lake and
getting some muskrat,

43:41.703 --> 43:44.070
which is a highly
renewable resource.

43:45.807 --> 43:49.742
I had one of the more
serious accidents that
I've ever had out here.

43:49.944 --> 43:52.478
I just dealt with it myself.

43:52.547 --> 43:53.846
On three, one two...

43:55.216 --> 43:58.317
Not too many people can
say that they can live
90% free of the rest of

43:58.386 --> 44:00.620
the world like I do.

44:04.292 --> 44:07.360
AGNES: I enjoy traveling
around the many
camps around the area.

44:07.429 --> 44:09.996
And I love doing it
with my daughters.

44:18.907 --> 44:21.073
-The next
time we go out hunting, we
could use the teepee after

44:21.176 --> 44:22.708
we repair it, huh?

44:22.811 --> 44:24.477
-Yup.

44:24.546 --> 44:27.079
-I'm glad we still got out
there and got the tent, even
though we broke down with the

44:27.182 --> 44:28.848
first snow machine.

44:28.917 --> 44:33.486
-I almost thought maybe we
should wait until next time,
but then since your dad's snow

44:33.555 --> 44:36.522
machine was sitting out
there and the weather
was good and everything,

44:36.758 --> 44:38.157
I thought we should go get it.

44:38.226 --> 44:40.126
-That way we could
repair it before.

44:40.228 --> 44:42.462
-Next season or next
time we go out, yup.

44:42.530 --> 44:45.765
Hopefully your dad
will notice the repairs
we do to the tent, huh?

44:46.067 --> 44:47.700
-It's been a hard
year without dad, huh?

44:47.802 --> 44:49.235
-Yep.

44:49.304 --> 44:51.237
-First time he ever
leave us that long.

44:51.306 --> 44:54.273
-Even though we go through
a lot of challenges
with your dad being gone,

44:54.342 --> 44:56.108
we successfully
did our hunts, huh?

44:56.211 --> 44:57.777
-Yeah.

44:58.012 --> 44:59.045
-This is it, girls!

44:59.147 --> 45:00.480
This is it.

45:00.582 --> 45:04.650
We went to Kookoochiaq
and did some fishing
with the net and all.

45:04.752 --> 45:05.852
Whitefish.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.386
We had to get our own wood.

45:07.489 --> 45:09.489
Whoa!

45:10.191 --> 45:11.824
QUTAN HAILSTONE: Timber!

45:13.061 --> 45:15.895
-It's been pretty much
challenging for us, it's...

45:15.964 --> 45:18.831
-Now we're preparing
for when he comes back.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.069
-I can't wait until
he gets back and joins
us, but most the time,

45:23.137 --> 45:26.472
I try not to think about
him gone so I don't start
to miss him and dwell on

45:26.541 --> 45:28.674
the (bleep) and
the sadness and stuff.

45:28.910 --> 45:32.345
And I just look forward for
tomorrow, and I tell myself
every day's a new day.

45:32.614 --> 45:36.048
We're getting ready for the
next adventures and the next
hunt, and stuff like that.

45:36.618 --> 45:41.087
So we can continue to feed
ourselves, clothe ourselves,
be warm in the extreme

45:41.189 --> 45:42.755
Arctic and stuff like that.

45:42.857 --> 45:45.992
Yeah, it's the hardest
thing, but yet, I'm trying
to live and have a good time,

45:46.094 --> 45:49.428
so whatever comes our way,
us girls will handle it.

45:50.798 --> 45:52.765
Let's go (bleep)
do something awesome.
