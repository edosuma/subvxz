00:28.689 --> 00:29.990
Good morning.

00:29.990 --> 00:31.225
Good morning.
Good morning.

00:31.225 --> 00:32.927
Good morning.
Good morning.

00:32.927 --> 00:36.463
For the record,
Daniel Michael Gallagher,

00:36.463 --> 00:39.099
convicted of murder
in the second degree,

00:39.099 --> 00:41.769
given a sentence
of 15 years to life.

00:42.469 --> 00:44.071
This is your first appearance

00:44.071 --> 00:45.940
before the board?
Yes, ma'am.

00:45.940 --> 00:47.975
You managed to keep
a clean disciplinary record.

00:47.975 --> 00:51.679
You were involved in the
exoneration of David Rangel?

00:51.679 --> 00:53.113
You seem
to have made it a point

00:53.113 --> 00:54.882
to provide that
kind of assistance.

00:54.882 --> 00:57.818
I agree with whoever it was that
said that the greatest threat

00:57.818 --> 01:00.621
to our system of justice
is an innocent man.

01:00.621 --> 01:02.957
And we understand you do have
a statement you've prepared.

01:02.957 --> 01:04.658
Yes, ma'am.

01:07.828 --> 01:11.866
I only wanted
to say that...

01:13.067 --> 01:14.535
...that I...

01:20.741 --> 01:23.577
That every day
that I have been in here,

01:23.577 --> 01:27.514
I have thought about
Alexandra Forrest.

01:27.514 --> 01:31.986
Because I need to make myself
understand what I did,

01:31.986 --> 01:33.754
how she died...

01:35.256 --> 01:38.125
...that I killed her...

01:38.125 --> 01:39.827
and why.

01:46.934 --> 01:50.771
My position,

01:50.771 --> 01:52.940
my accomplishments,

01:52.940 --> 01:55.943
everything that I had...

01:58.345 --> 02:01.815
...and everything
that I wanted...

02:01.815 --> 02:04.018
next to that, she meant nothing.

02:07.087 --> 02:10.891
That she tried to jeopardize it,

02:10.891 --> 02:13.594
in my mind...

02:13.594 --> 02:16.630
meant that I was justified
in whatever I chose to do.

02:17.798 --> 02:19.733
And I chose rage.

02:22.136 --> 02:24.271
I chose to lose control.

02:31.679 --> 02:33.747
I chose to take her life.

02:35.249 --> 02:37.685
And the man that I had always
believed myself to be

02:37.685 --> 02:39.653
could not have done that.

02:39.653 --> 02:41.255
But I did.

02:43.390 --> 02:46.126
So I have tried to take
every single day

02:46.126 --> 02:48.162
that I have been in here...

02:50.931 --> 02:53.867
...to come...

02:53.867 --> 02:55.035
to a better understanding

02:55.035 --> 02:57.738
of who I really am...

02:57.738 --> 02:59.239
and to atone.

03:05.346 --> 03:08.248
Um, that's all I have to say.

03:08.248 --> 03:12.786
If you were to be paroled, what
plans do you have for yourself?

03:18.892 --> 03:20.327
The first...

03:24.999 --> 03:26.667
The first thing
that I would like to do

03:26.667 --> 03:29.803
is to be reconnected
with my family.

03:29.803 --> 03:31.338
Do you have
any more questions?

03:31.338 --> 03:32.840
No.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.208
Thank you, Mr. Gallagher.

03:34.208 --> 03:36.076
We'll take all of this
under advisement

03:36.076 --> 03:38.078
and notify you
of our decision.

03:38.078 --> 03:40.180
Thank you all
very much.

03:43.183 --> 03:45.285
Come on.
Let's go.

04:16.083 --> 04:18.318
Uh, that's not mine.

04:18.318 --> 04:19.920
That's not my phone.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.188
Name?

04:21.188 --> 04:22.823
Ellen Gallagher.

04:24.925 --> 04:26.927
<i>...on vacation in
Switzerland, and, one morning,</i>

04:26.927 --> 04:29.897
<i>his wife came back from a hike
and described climbing a hill</i>

04:29.897 --> 04:31.899
<i>to find an old wooden house
at the top,</i>

04:31.899 --> 04:35.069
<i>with a beautiful
handcarved door.</i>

04:35.069 --> 04:37.337
<i>Did I not tell this story
in junior honors seminar?</i>

04:37.337 --> 04:39.339
<i>No? Okay.</i>

04:39.339 --> 04:41.075
<i>Well, so, after lunch,</i>

04:41.075 --> 04:43.110
<i>she wanted him to see
the house with the door,</i>

04:43.110 --> 04:44.778
<i>so they climbed the hill</i>

04:44.778 --> 04:46.814
<i>and then all
the surrounding hills,</i>

04:46.814 --> 04:48.782
<i>but they never found it.</i>

04:48.782 --> 04:52.252
<i>Carl Jung described his wife
as calm and rational,</i>

04:52.252 --> 04:54.154
<i>logical, impossible to fool.</i>

04:54.154 --> 04:56.790
<i>But so here was something
she swore had happened,</i>

04:56.790 --> 05:01.195
<i>that he absolutely
could not explain.</i>

05:01.195 --> 05:04.731
I mean,
four other classes, yeah,

05:04.731 --> 05:06.200
and then the reading,
as well.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.103
So it's-- it's a lot,
but, uh, I think I just find

05:09.103 --> 05:12.739
that, with, like, listening
and even taking notes,

05:12.739 --> 05:15.075
everything is just sort of gone
as soon as it's over.

05:15.075 --> 05:18.212
So doing that transcription
just really helps,

05:18.212 --> 05:20.447
like, set it in stone for me,
I guess.

05:20.447 --> 05:22.316
So it's worth
all the extra time.

05:22.316 --> 05:25.786
Plus, you'll have a hard copy of
every lecture to refer back to.

05:25.786 --> 05:27.221
Yeah.

05:29.223 --> 05:30.357
Still, though,
why are other people

05:30.357 --> 05:32.926
just, like, so good at it?
At what?

05:32.926 --> 05:35.262
Remembering
what they hear?

05:35.262 --> 05:36.530
Yeah.

05:36.530 --> 05:38.198
Trust me, they're not.

05:45.439 --> 05:46.940
So, do you--

05:46.940 --> 05:52.846
My father might be, um...

05:52.846 --> 05:54.548
up for parole.

05:58.852 --> 06:00.354
He's up for parole.

06:01.989 --> 06:05.292
That must have been so hard
for you to be holding on to.

06:05.292 --> 06:09.530
All this time, you've had to
carry his being in prison,

06:09.530 --> 06:12.799
when you had told me
he was dead.

06:15.936 --> 06:19.306
Well, he's never
e-mailed me before.

06:19.306 --> 06:20.974
Ever.

06:20.974 --> 06:23.243
And then he asked me
to come to his hearing,

06:23.243 --> 06:26.813
and I didn't e-mail back,

06:26.813 --> 06:28.582
but I went.

06:30.517 --> 06:32.052
I'm sorry that I lied.

06:35.422 --> 06:38.058
People tell me what
they're ready to tell me.

06:55.609 --> 06:57.377
Let me run something
by you, okay?

06:57.377 --> 06:59.146
Work-related?

06:59.146 --> 07:02.082
Speaking of birthdays,
it was Marlena's birthday.

07:02.082 --> 07:04.151
And she's been sending me
these screenshots

07:04.151 --> 07:06.220
of some shit
called a tennis bracelet.

07:06.220 --> 07:08.088
Like I got that kind
of scratch laying around.

07:08.088 --> 07:09.890
So I had to get creative.

07:09.890 --> 07:11.425
Oh, boy.

07:11.425 --> 07:12.993
What?
It's nothing.

07:12.993 --> 07:14.294
I just don't want to have
anything in my mouth

07:14.294 --> 07:15.529
when you tell me
what you did.

07:15.529 --> 07:17.130
So I thought to myself,

07:17.130 --> 07:18.932
"How much jewelry have I got
Winnie over the years?"

07:18.932 --> 07:21.168
And then I've never seen
most of it, like, ever again.

07:21.168 --> 07:23.403
So I looked,
and I found this one thing

07:23.403 --> 07:25.539
that pretty much solved
my problem exactly.

07:25.539 --> 07:27.174
So I repurposed it.

07:27.174 --> 07:30.277
Oh. Marlena loves it.
She went fucking crazy.

07:30.277 --> 07:32.579
I'm sure she did. You both
clearly have great taste.

07:32.579 --> 07:34.414
Fuck you, dude.
I need some advice here.

07:34.414 --> 07:36.984
Why? You already did the thing
I would have told you not to do.

07:36.984 --> 07:40.087
Because I could have sworn
that Winnie would not remember

07:40.087 --> 07:42.055
this fuckin' thing
that she's never worn once,

07:42.055 --> 07:44.224
but now she says
that she can't find it

07:44.224 --> 07:45.592
and that she thinks
someone stole it.

07:45.592 --> 07:47.294
And she wants me
to claim it on insurance.

07:47.294 --> 07:49.296
Which I have not done yet.
Because that's fraud.

07:49.296 --> 07:50.964
So I explained to her,
I was like, "Babe, look.

07:50.964 --> 07:53.300
It doesn't make sense that
a thief would just sneak in here

07:53.300 --> 07:55.235
and steal this one thing.
It probably just slipped

07:55.235 --> 07:57.271
through the cracks
in the drawer or whatever."

07:57.271 --> 07:59.673
Which, yeah, I think I might
just double down on that.

07:59.673 --> 08:01.241
Yeah, that's a good idea.

08:01.241 --> 08:03.510
Or you could blame it
on one of the kids.

08:04.645 --> 08:08.248
Frank, honestly, stop talking
to me, your direct supervisor,

08:08.248 --> 08:10.550
about your criminal
fucking enterprise.

08:10.550 --> 08:13.353
And if you come to my party with
anybody other than your wife,

08:13.353 --> 08:15.155
I will crap thunder on you.

08:15.155 --> 08:18.225
Like Marlena would want to come
to a geezer's party. She's 23.

08:19.059 --> 08:20.394
Oh, there it is, the face.

08:20.394 --> 08:23.330
You know, no wonder
they're gonna make you judge.

08:32.272 --> 08:35.275
- Well, happy birthday, Danny.
- Thank you, Terry.

08:35.275 --> 08:37.411
Also, tell me again
on Thursday.

08:42.249 --> 08:43.483
Morning.

08:43.483 --> 08:44.951
Good morning.

08:44.951 --> 08:46.253
You see the hearing's
been pushed?

08:46.253 --> 08:48.388
I did, yes, thank you.
How are you today?

08:48.388 --> 08:50.991
Okay.

08:50.991 --> 08:52.259
I had a dream last night

08:52.259 --> 08:54.494
this giant snake
bit me on the face.

08:54.494 --> 08:56.663
Well, that's disturbing.

08:58.598 --> 08:59.700
Beatrice.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.101
Oh.
Here for Koestner?

09:01.101 --> 09:02.602
Yep, it's been
a while

09:02.602 --> 09:05.172
since I've been up against
one of Norman's juries.

09:05.172 --> 09:08.141
You should be fine, so long as
you haven't missed anything.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.644
You haven't missed anything,
have you?

09:10.644 --> 09:12.412
Shut up.

09:12.412 --> 09:15.215
Ooh! Heard your 40th birthday's
coming up.

09:15.215 --> 09:17.517
That's young for a judge.

09:17.517 --> 09:19.453
Just not young
for a <i>person.</i>

09:19.453 --> 09:21.388
Damn!
Beatrice, that hurts.

09:35.268 --> 09:37.070
Hey, hey, boss. Hey.

09:37.070 --> 09:39.206
Hey.
Can I get a sign-off?

09:39.206 --> 09:42.409
Vehicular manslaughter.
I was thinking probation.

09:44.311 --> 09:46.713
Defendant blew a 1.8.
That's pretty drunk, Phil.

09:46.713 --> 09:48.248
Right, but it's
a first offense.

09:48.248 --> 09:50.117
Plus, the vic died
of a heart attack.

09:50.117 --> 09:52.319
No. No deal.
Save your empathy for somebody

09:52.319 --> 09:54.521
who doesn't get behind
the wheel shit-faced.

09:54.521 --> 09:56.189
Bad decisions lead
to bad outcomes.

09:56.189 --> 09:58.258
You play stupid games,
you win stupid prizes.

09:58.258 --> 10:00.060
How you doing, Your Honor?

10:00.060 --> 10:02.095
Don't jinx me, Gabriel.

10:10.504 --> 10:11.638
I'm home!

10:25.452 --> 10:27.320
Those are
pretty pictures.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.222
Nana got it for me.
Oh, really?

10:29.222 --> 10:30.690
At the Taschen store.

10:30.690 --> 10:32.559
It was sealed in plastic,
so it might have been

10:32.559 --> 10:35.362
the illustrated Scandinavian
Kama Sutra, for all she knew.

10:35.362 --> 10:37.531
But she liked the cover,
so here we are.

10:37.531 --> 10:40.267
But it's not, right?
Right?

10:40.267 --> 10:41.802
It's fairy tales.

10:41.802 --> 10:44.337
Fairy tales. Okay.
Fairy tales are good.

10:44.337 --> 10:46.640
We like fairy tales.
Mm-hmm.

10:59.252 --> 11:01.288
I'm sorry.

11:01.288 --> 11:02.823
Go on.

11:06.326 --> 11:10.464
I was
a complete shithead.

11:10.464 --> 11:12.332
And I'm sorry.

11:12.332 --> 11:14.301
The best was how
you literally had just said

11:14.301 --> 11:15.702
you didn't care
what we watched.

11:15.702 --> 11:17.571
It was extremely...
bag-of-dicks.

11:21.374 --> 11:25.679
You're right, I'm wrong,
I'm sorry...

11:25.679 --> 11:29.416
and I think maybe
just all the moving stuff

11:29.416 --> 11:30.851
was getting in my pocket.

11:30.851 --> 11:33.453
Wait. That was about moving?
Do you not want to move?

11:33.453 --> 11:36.122
Honey, I'm really just
trying to say I'm sorry.

11:37.390 --> 11:41.428
'Cause, you know, we can just
still flip that house instead.

11:41.428 --> 11:43.330
Just sayin'.
And while we're saying stuff,

11:43.330 --> 11:45.732
you don't have to be a judge
either if you don't want.

11:45.732 --> 11:47.734
"The hours are easier,
the schedule's more reliable,

11:47.734 --> 11:51.438
it's such an honor"--
that you can still refuse.

11:52.405 --> 11:54.574
It'd be a baller move, right?

11:54.574 --> 11:57.744
They offer it to me, and I'm
just like, "Tsk, eh, I'm good."

12:00.380 --> 12:03.149
I bet you didn't know that
judges get to go to conferences.

12:03.149 --> 12:04.784
In fancy places, no less.

12:04.784 --> 12:06.520
What kind and where?

12:06.520 --> 12:07.888
Mostly the law kind.

12:07.888 --> 12:10.390
And how about Aruba?

12:10.390 --> 12:11.758
Aruba means Milwaukee.

12:11.758 --> 12:13.660
Milwaukee means
San Bernardino.

12:13.660 --> 12:15.529
Hey, kiddo.

12:17.397 --> 12:19.165
Where do the sun
and the moon come into it?

12:19.165 --> 12:20.734
Well,
the stepmother's castle

12:20.734 --> 12:23.336
is east of the sun
and west of the moon.

12:23.336 --> 12:25.171
Ohh...

12:25.171 --> 12:26.640
Doesn't have to
have a stepmother,

12:26.640 --> 12:29.209
but when it does, man,
you know it's good, right?

12:35.348 --> 12:37.183
Hey, what's the problem
with Suarez's case?

12:37.183 --> 12:38.652
He says you're not
gonna charge it.

12:38.652 --> 12:40.453
I asked him to get
one of the four guys

12:40.453 --> 12:42.222
to flip on the other ones.
It's not a problem for me.

12:42.222 --> 12:43.723
Yeah, well,
he's already got a witness,

12:43.723 --> 12:47.394
who's a working man,
a father, community pillar.

12:47.394 --> 12:49.329
Why does he need to negotiate
with a murderer?

12:49.329 --> 12:51.565
Can you tell me where
this perfect witness
is gonna be in six months?

12:51.565 --> 12:53.867
Eating M&M's outside of
Courtroom 12 while waiting
to be called to the stand.

12:53.867 --> 12:56.202
And can you absolutely
promise me you can find
him and bring him in?

12:56.202 --> 12:58.238
Can I? Yes. You gonna
charge the case or not?

12:58.238 --> 12:59.806
I'm gonna
prosecutorial-discretion it.

12:59.806 --> 13:01.341
Aw!
Suarez has four guys.

13:01.341 --> 13:02.809
I'm just asking for one.

13:02.809 --> 13:04.511
Maybe <i>you</i> guys should
have gone to law school.

13:04.511 --> 13:06.212
No, I wanted to work
for a living.

13:06.212 --> 13:07.380
And here we are.

13:07.380 --> 13:09.482
Thank you.

13:09.482 --> 13:11.651
You still coming
to my party?

13:11.651 --> 13:13.253
I don't know.
You gonna be there?

13:13.253 --> 13:14.654
A full bar
is gonna be there.

13:14.654 --> 13:17.591
Plus, specialty cocktails
with themes.

13:17.591 --> 13:19.926
Ooh! At least
that's fuckin' stupid.

13:37.277 --> 13:38.578
Excuse me, sir. Hmm.

13:38.578 --> 13:40.280
There's no eating
in the courtroom.

13:40.280 --> 13:43.383
No, there's no <i>you</i> eating
in the courtroom. Just me.

13:43.383 --> 13:44.651
You're not me.

13:44.651 --> 13:46.920
Sad but true.
Where's Conchita?

13:46.920 --> 13:49.456
Double-booked,
but she sent her.

13:49.456 --> 13:51.725
Alice.
Okay.

13:51.725 --> 13:53.660
Or Alex.

13:53.660 --> 13:54.861
Well, which is it?

13:54.861 --> 13:56.696
Hmm.

13:56.696 --> 13:58.365
Someone should ask.

14:10.410 --> 14:13.546
Conchita got stuck upstairs,
said she's really sorry.

14:13.546 --> 14:15.715
I'm Alex Forrest.

14:15.715 --> 14:18.852
Alex. That's alright.
Dan Gallagher.

14:18.852 --> 14:20.920
Yeah, she loves you. Conchita.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.756
Yeah, she lowers
my blood pressure.

14:24.024 --> 14:26.626
So... you up to speed
on everything yet?

14:26.626 --> 14:28.862
Yeah, Conchita's definitely
their point person,

14:28.862 --> 14:31.297
but they know me,
so we're good.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.301
They're nervous.

14:35.301 --> 14:36.836
Well, let's go
talk to them.

14:44.711 --> 14:46.079
How you guys
holding up?

14:46.079 --> 14:48.415
Okay.

14:48.415 --> 14:50.050
Big day.

14:50.050 --> 14:51.851
All the times
I had to remind you

14:51.851 --> 14:54.087
to control
your facial expressions,

14:54.087 --> 14:56.656
hide your anger,
hide your pain,

14:56.656 --> 14:59.759
don't do anything to make
the jury feel bad,

14:59.759 --> 15:02.996
feel sorry for the man
who killed Yalina.

15:04.798 --> 15:07.467
But today this is...

15:16.076 --> 15:18.845
This is the sentencing phase.

15:18.845 --> 15:21.915
This is for the judge.

15:21.915 --> 15:23.683
He needs to know what you lost.

15:23.683 --> 15:26.986
So show him.

15:26.986 --> 15:29.856
If you feel angry, be angry.

15:29.856 --> 15:32.726
If you feel like
you want to cry, you cry.

15:32.726 --> 15:35.395
Today is the day
for all the emotions.

15:35.395 --> 15:37.597
And this is the place.

15:37.597 --> 15:39.733
Okay?
Yeah.

15:39.733 --> 15:41.000
Okay?
Yes.

15:42.569 --> 15:44.504
Thank you.
You're welcome.

15:44.504 --> 15:46.439
Thank you. Thanks.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.066
So, are you doing anything
for the big birthday?

16:07.066 --> 16:08.734
Wife's throwing me
a party.

16:08.734 --> 16:10.002
Nice. My mom wanted to do that
for my dad's 40th,

16:10.002 --> 16:11.837
but he didn't want her
to spend the money.

16:11.837 --> 16:13.405
If I was a wiser man,
I'd probably be saying
the same thing.

16:13.405 --> 16:14.907
Yeah, but then he had
a stroke the next year,

16:14.907 --> 16:18.644
so shouldn't have asked him;
should've just done it.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.846
Hi-de-ho, degenerates.

16:20.846 --> 16:22.648
Nice pocket square, E.B.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.083
Oh, you like that?

16:24.083 --> 16:26.619
Oh, what could possibly
go wrong with that?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.160
Victim services.
She works with Conchita.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.095
Conchita, man.
Conchita's the best.

16:36.095 --> 16:37.763
What's her name?

16:39.565 --> 16:41.133
Alice, I think?

16:41.133 --> 16:43.435
Hmm.
Is Alice my big toe?

16:43.435 --> 16:46.038
'Cause I want to bang her on
every piece of furniture I own.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.442
She wants
full overlay now.
Wait. What?

16:50.442 --> 16:52.545
Yeah, her friend Sharon
just had wood inserts put on

16:52.545 --> 16:54.713
all <i>her</i> appliances so they'll
blend with her cabinetry.

16:54.713 --> 16:57.049
Well, speaking of
new appliances,

16:57.049 --> 16:59.819
she wants a cheese
refrigerator now, too.
No, no.

16:59.819 --> 17:02.588
People are feeling a way
about cheese these days, Danny.

17:02.588 --> 17:03.756
Is that way constipated?

17:03.756 --> 17:04.990
It will be.

17:04.990 --> 17:07.193
Oh, hold.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.461
Hi. No, not yet.

17:09.461 --> 17:12.598
Uh, I'm--
I'm coming right now.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.467
Nope.
I forgot. Sorry.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.837
Here. You ask her.
For you.

17:17.837 --> 17:20.139
Let me clean this shit up.
Hey, pal.

17:20.139 --> 17:21.807
Well, I have these boots

17:21.807 --> 17:23.576
I'm trying to build
an outfit around,

17:23.576 --> 17:25.177
but now I'm thinking
I should just get over myself.

17:25.177 --> 17:26.612
So you excited about
going to that

17:26.612 --> 17:28.080
white-truffle
asshole place?

17:28.080 --> 17:29.682
Why can I never remember
the name of it?

17:29.682 --> 17:31.750
I don't know. Is that
even happening anymore?

17:31.750 --> 17:33.919
Send me a picture. Text it.
Okay. I will.

17:33.919 --> 17:36.555
She knows.
I will.

17:36.555 --> 17:40.659
Hey. Either you want me
to come home or you don't.

17:40.659 --> 17:42.494
What? How do we have
no bananas?

17:42.494 --> 17:44.096
I'll see you
tomorrow night, Dan.

17:44.096 --> 17:46.131
Bye, Beth. Well, if I'm going
to the store,

17:46.131 --> 17:47.633
do we need anything else?

17:47.633 --> 17:49.168
Well, <i>think,</i> woman.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.174
Isn't this thing
starting at 6:00?

17:55.174 --> 17:56.575
Are you
getting ready or...?

17:56.575 --> 17:58.811
Uh, sorry.
Dad pushed it to 7:30.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.750
So you didn't need me to
come home early from work then?

18:06.051 --> 18:07.753
No. I still
wanted you home.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.625
Oh, really? Why?

18:13.859 --> 18:15.694
Make you do stuff
for me.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.204
Pick it up.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.648
You goddamn...

18:35.648 --> 18:38.284
sexy lunatic.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.886
Aah!

18:43.889 --> 18:46.325
I didn't ask for
anything to be substituted.

18:46.325 --> 18:48.928
I simply asked, could they
not put it on the plate.

18:48.928 --> 18:52.064
Kind of an expensive restaurant
to make such a mistake, Bethie.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.832
So just don't
eat it then.

18:53.832 --> 18:56.869
It's not like they gave you
a grenade with the pin pulled.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.071
I just think it's funny.
That's all.

18:59.071 --> 19:00.739
They've got a hundred people
running around in here...

19:00.739 --> 19:02.107
Shh.

19:02.107 --> 19:03.876
...creating an unparalleled
dining experience.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.145
I will go ask them
to replate it.

19:06.145 --> 19:10.349
No one has to <i>do</i> anything.
I just said it was funny.

19:10.349 --> 19:13.285
I didn't want to substitute.
I didn't want it at all.

19:13.285 --> 19:16.322
And not only do I get it anyway,
but it's cold.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.691
Ironic polenta.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.726
Hm!

19:20.726 --> 19:22.094
Oh, boy.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.198
How we doing over here,
Eleanor?

19:26.198 --> 19:27.766
- Ellen.
- Lennon?

19:27.766 --> 19:28.934
Ellen.

19:28.934 --> 19:30.202
Ah. Lemon.

19:30.202 --> 19:31.904
Ellen.
Sluggo?

19:31.904 --> 19:34.273
Ellen.
Gordon Shumway.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.342
Hey, you want a slice of
my pork, Gordon Shumway?

19:36.342 --> 19:37.743
I think I'm good.

19:37.743 --> 19:38.911
You sure?
It's really good.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.312
I love you.
I love you, too.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.117
Yeah?
Clerk #1:
<i>Sorry to bother you, boss.</i>

19:45.117 --> 19:47.353
<i>Got a homicide in Lancaster.
No I.D. yet.</i>

19:47.353 --> 19:49.722
Okay. Call Frank,
tell him to go to the scene,

19:49.722 --> 19:51.123
have him give me a call when
he figures out what's going on.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.759
<i>Gotcha.</i>
Alright.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.260
No rest for the wicked.

19:56.795 --> 19:59.198
So it'll be
official soon, huh?

19:59.198 --> 20:02.067
Do they get you
the, uh-- the thing?

20:02.067 --> 20:03.635
Or do you get your own?

20:03.635 --> 20:04.937
The robe. Huh.

20:04.937 --> 20:08.340
You get your own.
Out of pocket, actually.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.275
You don't even have to,
funnily enough.

20:10.275 --> 20:12.745
There's no rule that says
a judge has to wear one.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.347
It's more of a tradition
at this point,

20:15.347 --> 20:17.249
a symbolic practice.

20:17.249 --> 20:20.686
How much more are you going to
be pulling down a year?

20:20.686 --> 20:22.955
20 K?

20:22.955 --> 20:25.190
It won't pay
for private school.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.426
Symbolism. Tradition.

20:27.426 --> 20:29.962
The fabric of society.

20:29.962 --> 20:32.197
Seven years at Stanford
to empty your pockets

20:32.197 --> 20:34.867
for a metal detector
in the morning?

20:34.867 --> 20:37.302
You're not doing that
for your family, Dan.

20:37.302 --> 20:39.238
Or for your credit rating.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.973
The end of the day,
it's all just

20:40.973 --> 20:44.243
a cool guy's
cops-and-robbers game.

20:50.749 --> 20:55.087
But, still, people will
have to call you Judge.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.156
I'm sure
you'll hate that.

21:22.514 --> 21:24.016
Look who it is!

21:24.016 --> 21:26.485

$400 bottles of wine,

3:30.

22:37.489 --> 22:39.791
Oh, shit.
Well, there goes the day then.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.493
12th floor called.

22:44.229 --> 22:45.497
She's looking for you.

23:07.119 --> 23:09.588
Okay. Not fair to keep you
in any more suspense.

23:09.588 --> 23:12.257
So, the appointment--
it's not happening.

23:12.257 --> 23:13.992
What? What are you
talking about?

23:13.992 --> 23:17.329
The governor's going
with Gus Howlett.

23:17.329 --> 23:18.897
Gus Howlett? Since when?

23:18.897 --> 23:20.432
He's not even
a fucking prosecutor.

23:20.432 --> 23:24.369
Yeah, I know. And the whole
thing is pretty embarrassing.

23:24.369 --> 23:26.071
Oh, I'm sure it is.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.906
I thought this was
<i>your</i> slot to fill.

23:27.906 --> 23:30.008
"It's a lock." I'm pretty sure
that's what you said.

23:30.008 --> 23:32.945
Okay. Howlett's father-in-law's
big money in the tech sector.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.513
He's got a whole lot of
king-shit weight

23:34.513 --> 23:36.615
to throw around, and when
that whole thing happened--

23:36.615 --> 23:38.917
I get it. Your corrupt buddy
is gonna let this asshole

23:38.917 --> 23:41.420
buy a fucking judgeship
for his son-in-law, Gus,

23:41.420 --> 23:43.055
that he doesn't even want,
right?!

23:43.055 --> 23:45.290
Okay. Watch it.

23:51.563 --> 23:53.265
Okay.

23:57.202 --> 23:59.238
We'll go back in
next round.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.073
Four years will be gone
before you know it.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.475
You're just gonna have to
have a little faith.

24:03.475 --> 24:05.510
You know, your father
wasn't appointed...

24:05.510 --> 24:07.946
Oh, fuck him.
...his first
go-around, either.

24:07.946 --> 24:10.482
Okay.

24:44.621 --> 24:46.089
This shit is just
how this shit is.

24:46.089 --> 24:47.424
It's like getting mad
at the wind for blowing.

24:47.424 --> 24:48.992
Look, they just rejected
whoever doesn't serve

24:48.992 --> 24:50.460
whatever agenda it is
they're pushing this cycle.

24:50.460 --> 24:52.963
It's not you.
I know, Mike.

24:52.963 --> 24:54.931
You know what else
no one gives a shit about?

24:54.931 --> 24:56.366
What age your dad
got on the bench

24:56.366 --> 24:59.136
and how you're not gonna
be younger than him.

24:59.136 --> 25:02.172
He would have.
He would've what?

25:02.172 --> 25:03.674
Given a shit.

25:03.674 --> 25:05.976
Well, yeah, that's just 'cause
that's the kind of grinding,

25:05.976 --> 25:07.978
petty needledick he was.

25:07.978 --> 25:11.548
But he's dead.

25:11.548 --> 25:13.583
So no one's even thinking
about that shit but you.

25:13.583 --> 25:16.420
Yeah, 'cause you're doing a
<i>great</i> job shutting up about it.

25:16.420 --> 25:18.188
You know, you should
maybe concentrate more

25:18.188 --> 25:20.457
on how you're gonna handle all
the sympathy you're gonna get,

25:20.457 --> 25:22.559
not to mention all the people
that want to see your balloon

25:22.559 --> 25:24.628
get popped a little.

25:24.628 --> 25:26.596
Look. What do you say
we pack it in

25:26.596 --> 25:28.465
and take this day
to Andolini's?

25:28.465 --> 25:31.535
I'm going at 3:30 for Dennis
Ortega's retirement thing.

25:31.535 --> 25:33.236
How'd you get out of that,
by the way?

25:33.236 --> 25:35.672
I probably said
it went to spam.

25:35.672 --> 25:37.541
Hey, maybe you should think

25:37.541 --> 25:40.077
about skipping it, too,
Dan, seriously.

25:40.077 --> 25:42.346
Well, like you said,

25:42.346 --> 25:43.747
got to start sometime.

25:43.747 --> 25:45.649
So might as well be today.

25:51.555 --> 25:54.324
Hey. Hey, guys.
How's it goin'?

25:56.727 --> 25:58.595
Good to see you.
How you guys doin'?

25:58.595 --> 26:01.298
It's a compliment and an honor,
but honestly,

26:01.298 --> 26:03.400
at the end of the day,
it's kind of a demotion.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.635
And, anyway, everybody knows
the court officers

26:05.635 --> 26:08.205
actually run the court,
not the judge. Who wants <i>that?</i>

26:08.205 --> 26:11.007
I want to <i>give</i>
three-hour summations,
not listen to them, right?

26:11.007 --> 26:13.477
You sit there long enough, your
brain goes straight to your ass.

26:13.477 --> 26:15.512
Why would I want you guys
telling me what to do?

26:15.512 --> 26:17.748
When to show up, when to eat
lunch, when to take a shit.

26:17.748 --> 26:19.616
I'm a D.A. I shit when <i>I</i> want.

26:39.569 --> 26:42.639
So what's the play here?
What are you thinking?

26:44.274 --> 26:47.144
Not sure yet. You?

26:47.144 --> 26:50.213
I don't know what
a lot of these are.

26:50.213 --> 26:52.416
Well... just take a bite
out of the mystery one,

26:52.416 --> 26:54.684
and if you don't like it,
throw it on the floor.

26:54.684 --> 26:56.820
Oh-- And they're cool
with that? The owners?

26:56.820 --> 26:58.722
Oh. Yeah, yeah.
They <i>want</i> you to do it.

26:58.722 --> 27:01.525
Yeah? Okay.

27:01.525 --> 27:03.493
Pecan fingers,
rainbow cookies

27:03.493 --> 27:05.328
which are actually cake
for some reason,

27:05.328 --> 27:06.730
amaretti and anise.

27:06.730 --> 27:09.599
These are ciminos.
That's sesame and orange. Fig.

27:09.599 --> 27:12.302
And last but not least,
Italian wedding butter cookies

27:12.302 --> 27:13.703
with chocolate
and pecan.

27:13.703 --> 27:15.472
Holy shit.

27:15.472 --> 27:18.108
Yeah, a lot of the <i>many</i> times
that I have been here,

27:18.108 --> 27:19.409
there have been cookies.

27:19.409 --> 27:21.344
Sure, but, I mean,
that's kind of a lot.

27:21.344 --> 27:22.779
Is Conchita here
with you?

27:22.779 --> 27:24.748
She brought me with her,
actually, but she's--

27:24.748 --> 27:26.249
she's already gone back.

27:26.249 --> 27:28.452
How has she never
brought you here before?

27:28.452 --> 27:31.087
How can a person work
in the Criminal Courts building

27:31.087 --> 27:32.556
and never come
to Andolini's?

27:32.556 --> 27:36.393
I just moved here
last September, so...

27:36.393 --> 27:38.462
Why? Because you had to
explain the cookies?

27:38.462 --> 27:43.366
Maybe I just-- I like having
desserts described to me.

27:43.366 --> 27:45.469
September.
That's eight months.

27:45.469 --> 27:48.605
Let's say 240-ish days.

27:48.605 --> 27:51.708
I'm here minimum
three times a week.

27:51.708 --> 27:53.510
Which means
that since you moved,

27:53.510 --> 27:56.246
I have been here
90 times.

27:56.246 --> 27:59.115
Must be the place to be,
I guess.

27:59.115 --> 28:01.651
Or just the place
I always am.

28:09.726 --> 28:11.628
Are you okay?

28:11.628 --> 28:14.898
I-I'm not asking for
any specifics. Obviously.

28:14.898 --> 28:17.634
I mean, I'm aware that
I don't actually know you.

28:17.634 --> 28:20.337
But... I don't know.

28:20.337 --> 28:22.606
You seem...

28:22.606 --> 28:24.407
something right now.

28:24.407 --> 28:26.510
Yeah, I probably do.

28:27.944 --> 28:30.547
Yeah, I probably do, too.

28:30.547 --> 28:34.618
Things are just...
a lot sometimes.

28:34.618 --> 28:35.886
Right?
Hm.

28:35.886 --> 28:37.487
And they just
keep happening.

28:38.688 --> 28:41.758
But don't worry.
It'll be okay.

28:43.293 --> 28:44.761
Or it won't.

28:47.464 --> 28:49.199
I'm gonna take these
on the road.

28:49.199 --> 28:52.869
I'm particularly excited
about the sesame.

28:52.869 --> 28:55.305
Very nice talking to you.

28:55.305 --> 28:56.940
Congratulations.

30:24.327 --> 30:25.662
Did you <i>just</i> get back?

30:25.662 --> 30:27.931
What? Me? No.

30:27.931 --> 30:29.366
Are you lying?

30:30.667 --> 30:31.901
I can smell it,
you know.

30:31.901 --> 30:33.403
You can smell lying?

30:33.403 --> 30:35.305
No, I can smell
the alcohol.

30:35.305 --> 30:38.375
Oh. That.
Well, <i>anybody</i> can do that.

30:41.645 --> 30:44.614
Have you ever pushed
that red button?

30:44.614 --> 30:46.282
I think you pull it.

30:47.384 --> 30:49.953
It says "pull."
But no. You?

30:49.953 --> 30:51.921
It's just
one of those things.

30:51.921 --> 30:54.557
You know, like every time I see
a ladder up against something,

30:54.557 --> 30:56.426
I feel the need
to climb it.

30:56.426 --> 30:58.395
So what do you think
would happen?

30:59.529 --> 31:01.831
Well... it says "stop,"

31:01.831 --> 31:04.434
so I think we'd stop.

31:04.434 --> 31:08.672
And then I think
a very loud bell would ring.

31:08.672 --> 31:11.374
And then eventually

31:11.374 --> 31:13.677
some court officer
in the basement would hear it,

31:13.677 --> 31:17.747
and eventually they would call
the fire department, maybe.

31:17.747 --> 31:21.017
But what if all the court
officers were at Andolini's?

31:23.386 --> 31:25.922
Like tonight,
for instance. Hm.

31:25.922 --> 31:29.059
Yes, that's
a very good point.

31:29.059 --> 31:31.327
And so what
would happen, then?

31:31.327 --> 31:33.563
Just... nothing?

31:33.563 --> 31:35.899
Or something?

31:38.501 --> 31:40.370
Would anybody come?

32:02.392 --> 32:03.793
The numbskull.

32:03.793 --> 32:06.029
Oh-ho! Danny!
Fellas.

32:06.029 --> 32:08.064
You old bag of glue.
What's up?

32:08.064 --> 32:09.933
Not much. What are you
still doing here?

32:09.933 --> 32:11.568
Working overnights.

32:11.568 --> 32:13.069
Want to grab a quick pop
or three at Andolini's?

32:13.069 --> 32:14.604
No, I'm done.
Just got back.

32:14.604 --> 32:15.972
It's all elbows and knees
over there right now.

32:15.972 --> 32:18.675
Ah, shit. Right.
The racket for Dennis.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.009
Yeah.
The racket.

32:20.009 --> 32:21.778
That guy never worked
a day in his life.

32:21.778 --> 32:23.713

34:13.690 --> 34:16.492
<i>Yeah?</i>
I crashed
the fucking car, Mike.

34:16.492 --> 34:19.262
<i>What the fuck?</i>
Car, Mikey. I crashed
the fucking car.

34:19.262 --> 34:21.231
<i>Where are you?</i>

34:21.231 --> 34:24.968
Uh, I'm under the 5
at Hollenbeck Park.

34:24.968 --> 34:26.603
<i>Are you hurt?
Is anybody hurt?</i>

34:26.603 --> 34:29.639
No, no, it's just the car.
The car is fucked.

34:29.639 --> 34:31.541
<i>Can you walk?</i>
Yeah. Yeah.

34:31.541 --> 34:33.943
<i>Okay. Okay.
Just start walking north.</i>

34:33.943 --> 34:35.278
<i>I will pick you up.</i>

34:35.278 --> 34:36.813
<i>Do it now.</i>

34:36.813 --> 34:39.215
Mike...
<i>I'll see you in 15, 20 max.</i>

34:39.215 --> 34:40.884
<i>And unless you want
to get breathalyzed,</i>

34:40.884 --> 34:42.551
<i>don't let anyone else
see you.</i>

34:47.815 --> 34:50.218
Where were you? Your last text
was like 2 hours ago.

34:50.218 --> 34:52.687
Sorry. I'm sorry.

34:55.122 --> 34:56.891
I got into an accident.
What?

34:56.891 --> 34:59.527
N-Nobody's hurt, but Mike
had to come and pick me up.

34:59.527 --> 35:01.596
My God.
What happened?

35:03.497 --> 35:06.067
I had a few too many pops
with Dennis and the boys.

35:06.067 --> 35:08.269
So you were drunk?

35:08.269 --> 35:10.771
Yeah, yeah, I probably
technically still am,

35:10.771 --> 35:13.674
but I feel pretty fucking sober
right now.

35:15.810 --> 35:18.012
You like Dennis and the guys
that much that you'd be willing

35:18.012 --> 35:20.848
to, like, risk killing
someone or yourself?

35:20.848 --> 35:22.817
Because why?

35:27.154 --> 35:28.756
I didn't get it.

35:30.658 --> 35:32.927
The appointment.

35:32.927 --> 35:35.096
It's not me.

35:35.096 --> 35:38.532
The-- Wait.
How do you know?

35:39.667 --> 35:40.968
Marcella told me
this morning.

35:40.968 --> 35:43.070
Why didn't you
just come home?

35:52.346 --> 35:54.115
Yeah.
Clerk #2:
<i>Sorry to bother you, boss.</i>

35:54.115 --> 35:56.851
<i>Baker's asking or another
adjournment on the Carew case.</i>

35:56.851 --> 35:58.853
<i>Says his mother-in-law's
in the hospital.</i>

35:58.853 --> 36:01.289
Really?
He must have forgot

36:01.289 --> 36:03.557
that he told us she died
two years ago.

36:03.557 --> 36:05.993
<i>Fuck me.
I'll let the judge know.</i>

36:11.098 --> 36:13.100
Oh, Christ.

36:16.637 --> 36:19.307
So what happens now
with your job?

36:22.243 --> 36:23.744
Nothing.

36:23.744 --> 36:25.913
You crashed
a company car drunk.

36:25.913 --> 36:28.883
We know that.
And Mike knows that.

36:28.883 --> 36:31.285
But they don't know that.

36:31.285 --> 36:34.288
And they won't if they
don't have a Breathalyzer.

36:36.891 --> 36:41.595
So I'll just get lectured
for crashing a company car

36:41.595 --> 36:44.765
that they searched and seized
and didn't pay for anyway.

36:49.870 --> 36:52.606
Are you hurt anywhere?

36:52.606 --> 36:54.342
No. No, I'm okay.

36:58.212 --> 37:00.314
Fuck them.

37:00.314 --> 37:03.617
For not knowing your value.
Fuck their whole asses.

37:03.617 --> 37:06.687
Maybe when they come
crawling back in four years,
you won't be around.

37:06.687 --> 37:08.656
You could have an equity
partnership right now

37:08.656 --> 37:11.993
if you wanted one,
and Marcella knows it.

37:11.993 --> 37:14.395
I bet you some of those firms
would even get you a driver

37:14.395 --> 37:16.163
if you asked.

37:21.736 --> 37:25.039
Want to watch
something?

37:25.039 --> 37:29.043
Just space out and laugh
at people trying to ice-fish?

37:30.811 --> 37:33.247
Yeah, you do. Come on.

38:25.433 --> 38:27.735
Yeah.

38:30.204 --> 38:32.406
Good morning, sunshine!

38:32.406 --> 38:34.842
Got my guy at traffic control
out of bed last night.

38:34.842 --> 38:36.977
We towed your car
back here.
What did he say?

38:36.977 --> 38:40.448
Uh, fuck me for waking him up.
What's he supposed to say?

38:40.448 --> 38:43.084
It's not his job to give a shit
about what you all get up to.

38:43.084 --> 38:45.486
So that's it?

38:45.486 --> 38:47.922
You don't <i>want</i> that
to be it?

38:49.490 --> 38:51.392
Here's your new ride.

38:51.392 --> 38:53.294
Well, new to you,
at least.

38:53.294 --> 38:56.230
I'm not totally sure it's not
a minivan, but fingers crossed!

39:52.353 --> 39:54.054
Hey.

39:55.556 --> 39:57.291
God damn it, Conchita.

39:57.291 --> 39:58.926
You know Phillipe's
is my favorite.

39:58.926 --> 40:00.861
Why are you like this?

40:00.861 --> 40:02.329
Would you like
the other half?

40:02.329 --> 40:04.064
What do <i>you</i> think?

40:05.466 --> 40:07.168
I think you can't have it
because I'm having it later

40:07.168 --> 40:09.170
is what I'm telling myself.

40:09.170 --> 40:12.840
Hey, um, on the Badillo case,
the hearing's next week.

40:12.840 --> 40:14.475
Can you have someone call
and just make sure

40:14.475 --> 40:17.011
that the uncle
stays in town?

40:17.011 --> 40:19.046
I got a feeling I'm gonna
need him after all.

40:19.046 --> 40:21.482
Uh, yeah. I'll talk to Drea
when she's back.

40:21.482 --> 40:25.119
Great. And next time, buy me
a French dip, too, would ya?

40:25.119 --> 40:26.987
For the love of God.
I will definitely

40:26.987 --> 40:30.024
probably think about reminding
myself to remember to do that.

40:36.096 --> 40:39.400
A halfway house
in Altadena.

40:41.969 --> 40:43.938
Wow. That...

40:45.906 --> 40:47.474
It seems fast. Yeah.

40:47.474 --> 40:49.910
He said, um,
like, once they grant it,

40:49.910 --> 40:52.980
it can go fast
because of overcrowding.

40:52.980 --> 40:57.351
Like, the state being motivated
to reduce overcrowding.

40:57.351 --> 40:59.486
So what happens now?

41:00.688 --> 41:02.957
He wants to see me.

41:04.692 --> 41:08.295
And he left it up to me when.

41:08.295 --> 41:10.064
Or if.

41:13.067 --> 41:15.002
Do you want me
to see him?

41:22.710 --> 41:25.012
But that shouldn't be
why you don't.

41:29.350 --> 41:31.518
Hey, yeah, I see you.
I see you. Yes, yes.

41:31.518 --> 41:34.388
You know what?
Don't say anything yet.
I'll tell him later.

41:34.388 --> 41:36.890
I just don't want him to hear it
and to have to figure out

41:36.890 --> 41:39.360
how to be about it
in front of you.

41:41.929 --> 41:44.031
Hi!

41:44.031 --> 41:46.166
Hi, Dad!

41:46.166 --> 41:47.968
<i>At one point,
Jung had a young woman</i>

41:47.968 --> 41:50.971
<i>as a patient who believed
she lived on the moon.</i>

41:50.971 --> 41:53.007
<i>To Jung, this story
she kept telling</i>

41:53.007 --> 41:56.243
<i>about where and how she lived
was the crux of her condition.</i>

41:56.243 --> 41:59.179
<i>So he made it clear
he accepted it completely.</i>

41:59.179 --> 42:02.116
<i>And after months of analysis,</i>

42:02.116 --> 42:03.984
<i>one day, she handed him
a heavy little bag,</i>

42:03.984 --> 42:07.121
<i>and inside,
there was a loaded gun.</i>

42:07.121 --> 42:10.090
<i>"What is this?"
Jung asked the young woman.</i>

42:10.090 --> 42:13.060
<i>She told him she'd had it
with her every time they met,</i>

42:13.060 --> 42:16.430
<i>and if he ever let her down
or said he didn't believe her,</i>

42:16.430 --> 42:19.099
<i>she would have
killed him with it.</i>

42:30.511 --> 42:32.046
Hi.

42:37.351 --> 42:40.187
Did the defendant
understand the nature

42:40.187 --> 42:42.256
and the quality of his act?

42:42.256 --> 42:44.625
And at the time
that he committed it,

42:44.625 --> 42:48.529
could he distinguish
between right and wrong?

42:48.529 --> 42:50.664
Mr. Symanchuk has claimed

42:50.664 --> 42:52.633
that he couldn't,
that he didn't.

42:52.633 --> 42:54.401
He was delusional.

42:54.401 --> 42:57.604
He was under the influence
of an irresistible impulse.

42:57.604 --> 43:01.141
The legal definition of which
would mean that he was unable

43:01.141 --> 43:03.644
to conform to the requirements
of the law.

43:05.412 --> 43:07.314
Hey. I thought
you were already here.

43:07.314 --> 43:09.049
<i>I was,
but I just left.</i>

43:09.049 --> 43:12.019
<i>They found Sylvie Rubidoh's
Audi in Pacoima.</i>

43:12.019 --> 43:15.589
Holy shit. Okay.
Fingers crossed.

43:15.589 --> 43:17.424
<i>Still have a drink, though.</i>

43:17.424 --> 43:19.560
<i>I already told them
to put it on my tab.</i>

43:19.560 --> 43:22.363
<i>Remember, you're pretty fucking
good just the way you are.</i>

43:22.363 --> 43:24.031
<i>Later, tater.</i>

43:25.299 --> 43:30.571
I'm a course assistant.
It's like a T.A.

43:30.571 --> 43:32.573
I bet you're really
great at that.

43:32.573 --> 43:34.041
Why?

43:34.041 --> 43:36.143
You always had
amazing focus.

43:41.215 --> 43:43.784
Um, what's it, uh--
What's it like? The house.

43:43.784 --> 43:45.319
Crowded.

43:45.319 --> 43:48.355
But I got priority placement,
so I'm lucky.

43:48.355 --> 43:52.092
I guess just given that
I didn't have a plan.

43:57.030 --> 43:58.632
That's not true.

44:01.368 --> 44:03.437
I <i>did</i> have a plan.

44:03.437 --> 44:07.174
I just couldn't act like it was
going to happen until it did.

44:07.174 --> 44:10.577
So many years
I've missed.

44:10.577 --> 44:14.381
Which is what
I asked for.

44:14.381 --> 44:16.049
How I wanted it.

44:18.585 --> 44:21.789
Now that I'm sitting here,
I'm...

44:21.789 --> 44:24.758
I just wish I could have
all that time back.

44:26.693 --> 44:28.729
Which I know
is not reasonable.

44:31.465 --> 44:34.635
And you should know
it's okay to say no.

44:36.737 --> 44:38.205
To what?

44:41.175 --> 44:42.709
I don't know yet.

44:49.450 --> 44:52.386
But first I have to
tell you something.

44:57.257 --> 44:59.092
Hey, Dan.

45:00.594 --> 45:04.131
I thought you said you came here
a minimum three times a week.

45:04.131 --> 45:06.600
I think I said "on average,"
didn't I?

45:09.770 --> 45:11.672
I was supposed to be
meeting someone here,

45:11.672 --> 45:14.641
but he had to take off
before I arrived.

45:14.641 --> 45:17.678
He's working on a case.
He's in Investigation Bureau.

45:17.678 --> 45:20.514
So, this woman disappears
about a month ago,

45:20.514 --> 45:22.549
hasn't used her phone,
credit cards,

45:22.549 --> 45:24.218
left her passport.

45:24.218 --> 45:26.453
Her car was missing until today,
but we finally found it.

45:26.453 --> 45:27.855
And I'm not saying
I want her to be,

45:27.855 --> 45:30.390
but I hope she's in the trunk.
Right, Scanlon?

45:30.390 --> 45:31.892
I'm innocent.

45:33.560 --> 45:35.195
Meatballs
are good here.

45:35.195 --> 45:37.331
Even if they were bad,
they'd still be pretty good.

45:37.331 --> 45:39.166
That's how I feel
about meatballs.

45:39.166 --> 45:43.170
So, what if she's not?
In the trunk?

45:44.938 --> 45:47.307
Well, I've been waiting
to find the wife so I can
charge the husband,

45:47.307 --> 45:49.142
and I've been trying to find the
car so I could find the wife.

45:49.142 --> 45:50.777
So you <i>need</i> her
to be in there.

45:50.777 --> 45:53.614
Right, because your worst fear
in a case without a body is that

45:53.614 --> 45:56.483
there you are standing up
in court, middle of the trial,

45:56.483 --> 45:58.685
and then the doors fly open
and your victim walks in.

45:58.685 --> 46:00.153
<i>Are</i> you worried
about that?

46:00.153 --> 46:01.922
Are you not sure
about the husband?

46:01.922 --> 46:05.926
Does some part of you think that
the wife is gonna walk in?

46:05.926 --> 46:07.728
No. I know she isn't.

46:08.962 --> 46:10.764
I need to say this
to your face,

46:10.764 --> 46:12.799
even if you don't
believe me.

46:12.799 --> 46:14.868
I did not kill that woman.

46:17.571 --> 46:19.373
Alex Forrest. I--

46:19.373 --> 46:20.741
Yes, you did.

46:20.741 --> 46:24.244
No, Ellen. No.
No, no, no. You--

46:24.244 --> 46:26.446
<i>You</i> said that you did.
What?

46:26.446 --> 46:29.783
You lost control,
in a rage,

46:29.783 --> 46:33.887
and she didn't matter,
so then you took her life.

46:33.887 --> 46:35.722
You were there?
You asked me to come.

46:35.722 --> 46:38.792
Ellen, I didn't--
You should have tol--

46:38.792 --> 46:41.194
I didn't know that you
were going to be there.

46:41.194 --> 46:43.196
So then what would you have said
if you knew that I was?

46:43.196 --> 46:44.865
Because what I heard was
that you killed her.
That's what I heard.

46:44.865 --> 46:48.969
Ellen, I had to say that.
It's what they want to hear.

46:48.969 --> 46:50.904
If you don't say that,
then nothing else matters.

46:50.904 --> 46:52.606
Okay, so then you <i>don't</i>
think about her.

46:52.606 --> 46:54.741
I am never <i>not</i>
thinking about her

46:54.741 --> 46:57.511
unless I'm thinking
about you.

46:57.511 --> 46:59.746
And I know how all this
must sound.

47:00.914 --> 47:02.683
I did not kill her.

47:04.651 --> 47:06.253
To be free,

47:06.253 --> 47:08.622
I had to say that I did.

47:12.059 --> 47:14.461
To be here.

47:14.461 --> 47:16.897
But I am now.

47:16.897 --> 47:18.765
And I'm going to prove it.

47:20.067 --> 47:22.536
Irresistible impulses
do not lend themselves

47:22.536 --> 47:25.372
to planning, over time,
without urgency.

47:25.372 --> 47:27.874
They are not defined by having
the opportunity to act

47:27.874 --> 47:29.977
and then not doing so.

47:29.977 --> 47:33.480
Irresistible impulses
are irresistible.

49:07.526 --> 49:09.128
<i>Irresistible impulses
do not lend themselves</i>

49:09.128 --> 49:11.930
to planning over time
without urgency.

49:12.331 --> 49:14.433
The thing that's most exciting
about this show is--

49:14.433 --> 49:15.410
it's in the title.
You know what happens.
