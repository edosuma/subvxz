If we sell this house,
do you want to split
the commission?

00:11.083 --> 00:13.792
Sure, sure.
I could use some cash.

00:13.875 --> 00:15.875
Seems like we make
a pretty good team.

00:17.041 --> 00:18.834
I could get a business
off the ground.

00:18.917 --> 00:21.333
- A business?
- A cupcake business.

00:21.417 --> 00:23.417
I'm Nicole. I'm a widow.

00:23.500 --> 00:26.667
My friends,
they keep trying
to make me feel better.

00:26.750 --> 00:29.291
- They don't
understand. I...
- They don't.

00:30.583 --> 00:32.500
- Want a lap dance?
- Yes, please.

00:32.583 --> 00:36.208
- My real name. It's Heather.
- I'm sure Heather
is a great girl.

00:36.291 --> 00:38.458
Going to throw away
everything you've worked for?

00:38.542 --> 00:40.250

got married.

To each other?

01:23.333 --> 01:25.417
Oh, God.

01:28.625 --> 01:31.125
- I don't do this.
- What do you do?

01:31.208 --> 01:35.750
I follow plans.
I make blueprints
and I follow the plan.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.625
That's what I do. I...

Well, I think last night
you followed some part
of your gorgeous anatomy.

01:43.041 --> 01:44.417
Yes, this is true.

- [both giggling]
- [knocking on door]

We have.
We've been flouting

01:59.792 --> 02:01.625
Wow.

02:01.709 --> 02:06.083
- Complimentary
honeymoon breakfast!
- Yes, but we didn't...

02:06.166 --> 02:07.583
You hung the order
on the door.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.834
Something you should
know about me.

02:09.917 --> 02:13.125
- Anything that's free,
I get it.
- Ah! Great.

02:13.208 --> 02:16.917
- So, uh, what did we order?
- For Mrs. Hillman...

02:19.250 --> 02:22.834
- That's my mother's name.
- You're not taking his name?

02:22.917 --> 02:24.375
- I...
- Yeah, are you...

02:24.458 --> 02:26.875
- Are you going to take my name?
- You want me to?

02:26.959 --> 02:28.917
I don't know.
What's your last name now?

02:29.000 --> 02:33.166
- OK, then. For Mr. Hillman...
- I hope you like eggs.

02:33.250 --> 02:35.333
As long as they're
not poached.

02:35.417 --> 02:37.959
That's... That's...
That's OK.

02:38.041 --> 02:42.792

I feel like I like them now.

- Thank you.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.125
So do you want

02:46.208 --> 02:47.834

- In the bed?

02:47.917 --> 02:50.959
We obviously know
each other so well.

02:51.041 --> 02:54.375
Yes, yes. But we are
in sync about one thing.

02:54.458 --> 02:56.250
- Skip breakfast.
- Skip breakfast.

02:56.333 --> 02:58.917
- Yes. All right. I love it.

[Adam playfully moaning]

03:05.375 --> 03:08.125
What are you doing?
No one cares about hedges.

03:08.208 --> 03:09.875
- Mrs. Elizaldé does.
- So what?

03:09.959 --> 03:11.750
She's selling,
not buying.

03:11.834 --> 03:15.417
The gardener?
He's been slacking off.
She asked me to look at them.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.166
- Always do what
anyone asks you to do?
- Nope.

03:18.250 --> 03:20.542
Sure you do.

03:20.625 --> 03:24.667
That's good. I need you to
start the caravan tomorrow.
I'm going to be late.

03:24.750 --> 03:27.500
Well, I thought you said
you don't do open houses.

03:27.583 --> 03:31.417
Caravan isn't the same
as an open house.
Open houses are for groupies.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.208
Caravans are for agents
and serious clients.

03:34.291 --> 03:37.500
- It's the first step
to a big sale.
- Why'd you move the sign?

03:37.583 --> 03:40.041
If there's not one,
people'll think we already

03:40.125 --> 03:43.125
have an offer.
We'll be in multiples
by the end of the week.

03:43.208 --> 03:47.083
Look at you, getting
all excited. Selling houses
really turns you on.

03:47.166 --> 03:49.875
- I don't get excited.
- Sure you do.
You're flushed.

03:49.959 --> 03:52.417
Like the other night,
upstairs in the bedroom.

03:52.500 --> 03:56.375
Most women don't fall
for pick-up lines from
guys holding garden shears.

03:56.458 --> 03:58.458
You can't stop
thinking about it.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.834
Look, I am flattered
by the attention.

04:00.917 --> 04:03.417
But I told you, I don't
want a relationship.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.542
I don't want to date.
I just want to focus
on my career.

04:06.625 --> 04:11.083
You can do both, you know.
Have a career and
a social life. I do.

04:11.166 --> 04:14.458
That's why I'm going
to find a buyer
for this house before you.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.792
See you tomorrow.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.875
[door closes]

04:35.959 --> 04:39.542

are you home?
- Yeah. I'm here.

04:41.250 --> 04:42.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:45.417 --> 04:49.375
- So what did you do today?
- I did the cupcake thing.

04:49.458 --> 04:52.875
Yeah. What did you do?
Did you get out?

04:52.959 --> 04:55.125
Well, you know,
I don't get out much

04:55.208 --> 04:57.875
now that the doctors
made me stop working.

04:58.959 --> 05:00.959
You're lucky.
It's a jungle out there.

05:01.041 --> 05:04.041
I went to different
coffee-houses
with my cupcakes,

05:04.125 --> 05:07.291
- but they all have suppliers.
- What? You went in there cold?

05:07.375 --> 05:10.125
That's not how you do it.
You get that first order.

05:10.208 --> 05:12.667
That order
leads to the next,
and so on and so on.

05:12.750 --> 05:16.250
That's the point.
How do I get my first order?

05:16.333 --> 05:19.458
Your friends. Hello?
You... You network.

05:19.542 --> 05:21.834
You cajole, you don't
take no for an answer.

05:21.917 --> 05:24.333
We have to know somebody
who needs cupcakes.

05:25.917 --> 05:27.208
You get them to hire you,

05:27.291 --> 05:28.959
then you put out
those cute little

05:29.041 --> 05:32.834
business cards.
We could do
a really cool logo.

05:32.917 --> 05:35.333
Oh, my God.
I'm having ideas.

05:35.417 --> 05:40.166
I don't think
I've had a single idea
since Angelo died.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.667
Can't start a business
unless you're selling.

05:42.750 --> 05:44.792
- Know what you're selling?
- Cupcakes?

05:44.875 --> 05:46.083
No. Yourself.

05:48.083 --> 05:51.291
It's not funny.
How many orders
do you have so far?

05:51.375 --> 05:54.250
- Zero.
- That's my point.

05:54.333 --> 05:58.959
I guarantee you I will
have your first order
by the end of the night.

05:59.667 --> 06:01.625

over everything.

Deena wants me
to watch the kids
while she tries to get

06:12.875 --> 06:15.166
an order for cupcakes,
never gonna happen.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.834
- She already got it.
- You ordered the cupcakes?

06:17.917 --> 06:20.542
I needed something homey
and sweet for the caravan.

06:20.625 --> 06:22.792
Caravan? What are you,
Lawrence of Arabia?

06:22.875 --> 06:26.500
Nic called and asked me
to order them as a favor,

06:26.583 --> 06:29.041
- to get Deena's
company rolling.
- Fantastic.

06:29.125 --> 06:30.875
You do what anyone
asks you to do?

06:30.959 --> 06:33.875
- No, I do not.
- Hey. Are you still
coming tomorrow?

06:35.542 --> 06:37.792
Oh, please tell me
she didn't get you
to do this.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.709

to everything anybody asks.

were handpicked by me.

so I had to get
Brian and Jimmy.

07:03.542 --> 07:05.083
Why didn't you ask me?

07:05.166 --> 07:09.000
Because I thought,
maybe, you'd still be
a little damaged.

07:09.083 --> 07:12.417
- From Deena and the separation.
- Great. Yeah, terrific.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.750

the guys'd be available.

This is a terrible idea.

No, this is a great idea,
Jim. And you should
totally bring Bridget.

set her up with guys?
- Nineteen other jerks.

look great.

- There you go.
- What do I do?

11:12.417 --> 11:15.375
Put it in the vintage oven
at 350 for 30 minutes.

11:15.458 --> 11:18.667
- It'll make
the house smell good.
- OK. It's a good idea.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.250
- Hello.
- Hi.

11:22.333 --> 11:26.542
I'm early, but I can't
stand my realtor so I want
to do a run through before

11:26.625 --> 11:30.083
she gets here.
Not that I have anything
against realtors.

11:30.166 --> 11:31.834
I'm not a realtor.

11:31.917 --> 11:34.417
- Thank God, that
would've been awkward.
- Yeah.

11:34.500 --> 11:38.041
- Want a cupcake?
- Absolutely.

11:39.083 --> 11:40.792
Let's see here.
It looks good.

11:43.625 --> 11:45.917
- That's a damn
good cupcake.
- Thanks.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.542
- I'm T.K. T.K.
- T.K.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.542
- My name's T.K.
- Deena.

11:50.625 --> 11:53.500
How you doing?
I'm Brian Davis.
Are you a realtor?

11:53.583 --> 11:54.709
- No.
- No.

11:54.792 --> 11:57.959
I mean, not that we have
anything against realtors.

11:59.291 --> 12:01.500
- I'm going to go.
- Thanks again, Deena.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.125
Yeah.

12:03.208 --> 12:07.583
So, um, how about we
check out the kitchen first?
There's a vintage...

12:13.500 --> 12:15.375
Don't you have to be
at work already?

12:15.458 --> 12:17.291
I have a deposition
in Pasadena.

12:17.375 --> 12:20.959
I'm going to go
straight there.

12:23.917 --> 12:26.709
Do you need anything?
Food? TV? Crackers?

12:26.792 --> 12:29.208
No, I'm fine. Crackers?

12:29.291 --> 12:30.750
Yeah. I don't know.

12:30.834 --> 12:34.041
I don't know why I keep acting
like you've never been here.

12:34.125 --> 12:35.625
What's that?

12:35.709 --> 12:40.166
Uh, our marriage
certificate.

12:40.250 --> 12:43.917
Amazing how little
you need to know about
someone to get married.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.291
Name, address,
social security number,

12:46.375 --> 12:49.125
photo ID. That's it.

12:49.208 --> 12:51.208
It's harder to get
cable installed.

12:51.291 --> 12:54.250
Well, why don't
we start by giving you

12:54.333 --> 12:57.625
my office number just in case
you need to reach me?

12:57.709 --> 12:59.709
Yeah.

12:59.792 --> 13:02.083
You know what I was
just thinking about?

13:02.166 --> 13:05.083
What if I get hit
by a bus this afternoon
and end up in a coma?

13:05.166 --> 13:07.500
OK, well, that's morbid.

13:07.583 --> 13:10.333
You'd be the one
who'd have to make
all the decisions

13:10.417 --> 13:11.917
about
what to do with me.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.125
Pull the plug,
put me on life-support,

13:14.208 --> 13:15.458
give me a feeding tube.

13:15.542 --> 13:17.375
How weird is that?

13:17.458 --> 13:21.250
Not as weird as you
thinking about all this
the day after we got married.

13:21.333 --> 13:24.333
OK, so I'm going to
see you tonight, right?

13:24.417 --> 13:26.709
Unless, of course,
one of us gets hit by a bus.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.500
There you go.

13:31.583 --> 13:34.583
Uh, actually,
I don't get off work
until three tonight.

13:34.667 --> 13:36.792
But I'll be here
when you wake up.

13:36.875 --> 13:40.458
Right. Great.

13:44.041 --> 13:46.792
So cupcakes? Hi.
That was your big plan?

13:46.875 --> 13:49.750
Told me to make it smell good.
I got three potentials.

13:49.834 --> 13:52.000
- How are you doing?
- Think those people

13:52.083 --> 13:55.792
are interested because
you were their friend?
Nice angle.

13:55.875 --> 13:58.000
- What's yours?
- I know how to target.

13:58.083 --> 14:00.458
I know who's interested
and who's not. Hi.

14:00.542 --> 14:02.834
- Hi.
- I don't need cupcakes.

14:02.917 --> 14:05.667
You probably
don't even know
how to bake cupcakes.

14:07.291 --> 14:09.000
Apparently,
neither do you.

14:15.291 --> 14:20.000
Are you trying to make it
so that neither one of us
can sell this house?

14:20.083 --> 14:23.458
- It's really not that bad.
- We can't show
the house like this.

14:23.542 --> 14:24.917
Look, why not? Hey, hey.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.333
Give people a wet cloth

14:26.417 --> 14:28.875
to place over their face
and stay low to the ground,

14:28.959 --> 14:31.959
where air is cool.
It'll be just like
Towering Inferno.

14:33.917 --> 14:35.959
I saw that.
You almost laughed.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.750
No, actually I was really
just coughing on the smoke.

14:39.834 --> 14:43.417
- Can I tell you about yourself?
- Is there any way
I can stop you?

14:43.500 --> 14:45.250
You take things
too seriously.

14:48.083 --> 14:51.834
Listen, I'm going
to this thing tonight
for a friend.

14:51.917 --> 14:54.875
She owns a bar
and she's having
speed-dating tonight.

14:54.959 --> 14:57.875
- You should come with me.
- Why? I told you
I'm not dating.

14:57.959 --> 14:59.375
How about for fun?

14:59.458 --> 15:02.333
Maybe you've heard of it.
Seen pictures.

15:02.417 --> 15:06.291
If you're worried
I'll get more dates, it's
perfectly understandable.

15:06.375 --> 15:09.291
That is not going
to work on me. We're not
in middle school.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.125
Fine, don't go.

15:11.208 --> 15:14.166
I'll get more dates than you
and meet more clients.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.083
Technically? Unemployed.

15:19.166 --> 15:21.750
I do a lot of
freelance work, though.

15:21.834 --> 15:25.542
Really? Is there
a big market for
freelance urologists?

15:34.208 --> 15:36.959
- [air horn blares]
- Rotate!

15:40.458 --> 15:43.583
Kids bring joy to your life.
I'm not saying that they don't.

15:43.667 --> 15:47.125
I wish that they could
drive themselves to school.
Know what I mean?

15:47.208 --> 15:50.542
I don't know about you,
but I think
it's kind of stupid.

15:50.625 --> 15:53.041
I totally understand
the concept behind this,

15:53.125 --> 15:55.583
but what can you learn
in three minutes?

15:55.667 --> 15:58.291
I like to eat my own hair.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.250
[air horn blares]

16:00.333 --> 16:03.333
Maybe if I had
took off my ring
that would've helped.

16:03.417 --> 16:06.417
Well, no offense, Dave,
but I'm not sure
losing the ring

16:06.500 --> 16:09.458
would've made
much of a difference.

16:09.542 --> 16:12.208
Not talking about your wife
might be a good start.

16:12.291 --> 16:15.750
- Brian said you could
be a real bitch.
- [air horn blares]

16:15.834 --> 16:16.875
Rotate!

16:16.959 --> 16:18.834
Please tell me
you're normal.

16:19.917 --> 16:21.917
OK, I'm really close
with my family.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.625
I mean, my brother and I
have a real special
relationship, you know,

16:25.709 --> 16:28.333
which some people think is
weird. Know what I mean?

16:28.417 --> 16:32.125
You probably have
the same thing with your
sister or mom or something.

16:32.208 --> 16:35.500
Wow, my mouth
is getting really dry.
Am I talking too much?

16:35.583 --> 16:38.083
- [air horn blares]
- [clears throat]

16:39.709 --> 16:43.000
- Hey.
- Well, hey. How you doing?

16:43.083 --> 16:44.583
[air horn blares]

16:44.667 --> 16:46.875
Did that feel like
three minutes to you?

16:46.959 --> 16:48.750
[air horn blares]

16:49.750 --> 16:51.583
Got to go.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.250
What's this?

16:53.333 --> 16:55.917
Just a little research
I pulled together today.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.959
"Market analysis
for the specialty catering
and baking goods industry?"

17:00.041 --> 17:01.875
I'm sorry it's not
more organized,

17:01.959 --> 17:04.458
but there's so much data
to be mined out there.

17:04.542 --> 17:07.500
- Nic, you're out of control.
- Just read it.

17:07.583 --> 17:10.709
Honey, I don't want
to take over the world
with my cupcakes!

17:10.792 --> 17:13.417
You're never going to get
another order this way.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.500
It's just not going
to fall in your lap.

17:15.583 --> 17:17.500
- [phone rings]
- [clears throat]

17:19.208 --> 17:20.625
Hello?

17:21.917 --> 17:24.875
Yes, of course
I remember.

17:26.250 --> 17:28.000
Are you serious?

17:28.083 --> 17:32.208
Oh, no. Um, not a problem.
I can do it.

17:33.834 --> 17:36.166
OK, thank you. Bye.

17:37.583 --> 17:40.250
- Wow.
- What? Who was that?

17:40.333 --> 17:44.542
Another order
just falling into my lap.

17:44.625 --> 17:48.625
- What?
- This guy I met
at the open house.

17:48.709 --> 17:52.375
He's throwing an anniversary
party for his parents
at his yacht club

17:52.458 --> 17:55.583
and he wants 200 cupcakes
by the day after tomorrow.

17:55.667 --> 17:58.959
- Can we even do that?
- Oh, my God. What am I
going to wear?

17:59.041 --> 18:03.709
Wear? What? An apron
and a doughboy hat.

18:05.625 --> 18:07.333
What are you
talking about?

18:07.417 --> 18:11.625
Well, this guy, T.K.,
he's kind of...
There's a little chemistry.

18:11.709 --> 18:14.166
- No. We are
starting a business.
- But...

18:14.250 --> 18:16.625
- We don't boff the clients.
- We?

18:16.709 --> 18:19.041
You could do a lot worse
for a partner. Trust me.

18:19.125 --> 18:22.625
- I don't need a partner.
- Two hundred cupcakes
in two days?

18:22.709 --> 18:25.875
- Tell me you don't
need my help.
- I better go preheat the oven.

18:28.583 --> 18:31.333
- Having fun on our date?
- This is so not a date.

18:31.417 --> 18:33.875
- Kind of is.
- Tell me your mind's
not addled enough

18:33.959 --> 18:37.834
to believe that by getting
me here I'd realize what
a great a guy you were?

18:39.583 --> 18:42.875
You know, why won't you
just give me a chance?
Am I that bad?

18:42.959 --> 18:45.083
- You really want to know?
- Yes.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.166
Even if it hurts?

18:47.709 --> 18:51.125
- OK.
- OK. I have a feeling,

18:51.208 --> 18:54.709
and correct me if
I'm wrong, but I have
a feeling that you're

18:54.792 --> 18:56.208
one of those lost souls.

18:56.291 --> 19:00.000
One of those guys constantly
on a quest to find himself.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.792
And, normally, I would
find that romantic,

19:02.875 --> 19:05.333
if I thought you had
a chance of succeeding.

19:05.417 --> 19:07.041
But I don't.

19:09.083 --> 19:10.709
And why is that?

19:10.792 --> 19:14.166
Because you can't stand
to let anyone down.
You can't say no.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.166
That's why
everyone likes you.

19:16.250 --> 19:19.875
That's why you'll
probably get more dates
than I do tonight.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.792
You're never
going to find yourself

19:21.875 --> 19:25.000
unless you do what you
want to and not care
what anyone thinks.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.291
So you don't care
if anyone likes you?

19:29.792 --> 19:32.000
I try not to.

19:32.083 --> 19:36.083
Maybe you're afraid
if you care about someone
you might get hurt if you do.

19:37.417 --> 19:40.625
Maybe.
But that conversation

19:40.709 --> 19:42.709
would take longer
than three minutes.

19:44.500 --> 19:47.333
So give me more
than three minutes.
Can you do that?

19:47.417 --> 19:49.834
It's all I'm asking.

19:51.959 --> 19:54.291
[air horn blares]

19:54.375 --> 19:56.750
Saved by the horn.

20:01.250 --> 20:03.792
- Are you sleeping?
- No.

20:05.583 --> 20:06.583
Can we talk?

20:14.291 --> 20:17.709
You didn't say anything
earlier, but I know
your friends hate me.

20:17.792 --> 20:20.750
Are you kidding?
They love you.

20:20.834 --> 20:23.333
- They are totally on board.
- Adam.

20:23.417 --> 20:26.458
Everyone needs
a little time to adjust
to the idea, OK?

20:26.542 --> 20:29.542
I mean,
it was kind of sudden.

20:29.625 --> 20:32.000
- And what about us?
- What about us?

20:33.834 --> 20:36.625
Before I say anything else,
I want you to kiss me, OK?

20:36.709 --> 20:39.000
So you know this is
coming from a good place.

20:39.083 --> 20:43.291
- OK, you're freaking me out.
- Just kiss me, OK?

20:49.875 --> 20:52.542
I think getting married
may have been a mistake.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.500
I'm so glad you said that.

20:57.583 --> 20:58.709
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:58.792 --> 21:00.208
I thought it was just me.

21:00.291 --> 21:03.458
I feel like we ruined
this relationship
by getting married.

21:03.542 --> 21:08.000
Me too. It's like, all
of a sudden, we're acting
like total strangers.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.750
I feel like we've done
this whole thing backwards.

21:10.834 --> 21:14.166
So maybe we should
actually go backwards.

21:15.542 --> 21:16.834
What do you mean?

21:19.166 --> 21:21.166
I think we should
get an annulment.

21:28.375 --> 21:31.333
- We can say we were drunk.
- I wasn't drunk. Were you?

21:31.417 --> 21:33.792
I don't really drink.
Gives me indigestion.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.208
Well, then I can't say
that we were drunk.

21:36.291 --> 21:39.458
I'm an officer of the court.
I can't lie in front
of Jocelyn.

21:39.542 --> 21:42.083
- Jocelyn?
- Yeah, she's the judge.

21:42.166 --> 21:44.500
That's how I got us in
quickly. She loves me.

21:44.583 --> 21:46.458
Hmm. Nice.

21:48.208 --> 21:50.959
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

21:51.041 --> 21:55.542
I thought this whole
annulment thing would
take more time. What else?

21:55.625 --> 21:59.333
Well, if you were 14,
they'd annul
the marriage immediately.

21:59.417 --> 22:02.083
- They'd throw you in jail.
- Tell me you're not 14.

22:02.166 --> 22:03.458
I'm not.

22:03.542 --> 22:05.417
I have been
through every argument

22:05.500 --> 22:08.583
and the only thing
I can come up with
is one possible claim.

22:08.667 --> 22:10.291
What's that?

22:10.375 --> 22:13.250
Well, that I was
of unsound mind
when I married you.

22:13.333 --> 22:16.166
Won't affect your career?
Pleading insanity to a judge

22:16.250 --> 22:18.834
- you try cases in front of?
- Temporary insanity.

22:18.917 --> 22:20.709
Relating
to a specific time.

22:20.792 --> 22:23.917
I experienced a deeply
traumatic event being
left at the altar.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.709
I was shell-shocked,
I reacted rashly,

22:26.792 --> 22:29.250
and married a girl
I hardly knew
on the rebound.

22:29.333 --> 22:31.542
A stripper, on top
of everything else.

22:31.625 --> 22:35.125
I mean, tell me,
how unsound is that?

22:36.083 --> 22:38.333
- Is that true?
- Is what true?

22:38.417 --> 22:40.583
All of it.
Do you really believe that?

22:40.667 --> 22:42.083
Heather.

22:42.166 --> 22:43.625
When you asked me out,

22:43.709 --> 22:47.166
you didn't know what you
were doing then either?
You were crazy?

22:47.250 --> 22:50.542
- Out of your unsound mind?
- Why are you taking
this personally?

22:50.625 --> 22:52.834
Thought we were trying
to figure this out.

22:52.917 --> 22:54.917
You've obviously
got it figured out.

22:59.542 --> 23:02.667
Oh, uh, honey, that's not
really the right stroke.

23:02.750 --> 23:06.667
It's more like a fluff.
You know, like a twist
and a fluff.

23:06.750 --> 23:09.041
Oh, well, anyway.
I have to go.

23:09.125 --> 23:10.959
What? Why?
Where are you going?

23:11.041 --> 23:13.083
- I've got grief group.
- Grief group.

23:13.166 --> 23:15.333
Maria can help you get
this into the car.

23:15.417 --> 23:19.667
Oh, God. This is a bad idea.
I never should have
agreed to do this.

23:19.750 --> 23:22.625
Going to be OK.
Remember when you
get there, be creative.

23:22.709 --> 23:24.750
- OK.
- No, I'm serious.

23:24.834 --> 23:27.709
Can't throw cupcakes
on a table and
call it a dessert.

23:27.792 --> 23:29.917
You have to stand out.
Be professional.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.375
- OK, enough.
- If we're going
to be partners,

23:32.458 --> 23:34.542
I want to make sure
we're on the same page.

23:34.625 --> 23:38.125
But I don't want a partner.
I mean, I never asked for one.

23:38.208 --> 23:41.583
I just wanted to make
some cupcakes for
my friends, you know?

23:41.667 --> 23:44.917
- Make a few bucks on the side.
- That's not a business plan.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.834
OK, but I don't care
because this is my business.

23:47.917 --> 23:51.750
It's not yours.
And I don't want you bossing
me around all the time.

23:51.834 --> 23:54.417
Honey, I mean,
can't you just get
your own thing,

23:54.500 --> 23:56.500
you know,
and let me do mine?

23:56.583 --> 24:00.291
Wait. Honey. I'm sorry,
Nic. Don't go. I...

24:00.375 --> 24:04.625
- Oh. Hi, Maria.
- Mrs. Deena. I'm so sorry.

24:04.709 --> 24:06.834
I have a big problem.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.417
Gerald Anderson.

24:12.500 --> 24:16.000
He's taking me to dinner
tonight at 6:30. Sushi Haniwa.

24:16.083 --> 24:19.333
- I thought you don't do dating.
- You kind of changed my mind.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.834
I have been a little
career-obsessed lately,

24:21.917 --> 24:24.375
and maybe a fun night
on the town is what I need.

24:24.458 --> 24:26.959
I guess Gerald
doesn't know
how to say no either.

24:27.041 --> 24:28.625
Well,
apparently not to me.

24:28.709 --> 24:33.125
Well, a lot of girls
said yes to me. Nineteen
out of 20 as opposed to one.

24:33.208 --> 24:37.291
Well, I got twenty
out of twenty.
Including you.

24:37.375 --> 24:39.542
- What?
- Yeah. A full house.

24:39.625 --> 24:42.875
You know,
I knew I should have
left you off.

24:42.959 --> 24:45.959
- This is technically a tie.
- Why are you so competitive?

24:46.041 --> 24:47.959
I'm happy for you.
Was Gerald the one

24:48.041 --> 24:51.291
who tied his sweater
around his neck?
That should be a lot of fun.

24:51.375 --> 24:53.166
Which one are you
going out with?

24:53.250 --> 24:55.375
Which one am I not
going out with?

24:55.458 --> 24:57.375
- OK.
- Let me start at the top.

24:57.458 --> 25:00.000
Linda Adams.
She was pretty hot.

25:00.083 --> 25:03.542
Well, isn't she the lucky one.
I'll tell Gerald you say hi.

25:03.625 --> 25:07.291
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a house to sell.

25:08.750 --> 25:11.709
- Hi there! How are you?
- Hello.

25:14.250 --> 25:16.667
Who the hell
is Linda Adams?

25:23.834 --> 25:26.500
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Daddy.

25:26.583 --> 25:28.458
Honey. Hi Daddy?
What the heck?

25:28.542 --> 25:30.792
Don't you ever pick up
your phone anymore?

25:30.875 --> 25:33.709
- No, I was on
a conference call.
- I'm sorry.

25:33.792 --> 25:36.500
I will never
do this to you again,
I promise.

25:36.583 --> 25:40.709
I mean, I will take care
of the girls every weekend
for the next 50 years

25:40.792 --> 25:42.834
if you will
do this for me. Please!

25:42.917 --> 25:44.875
Honey, I'm at work.

25:44.959 --> 25:48.542
Maria had an emergency
at home and she can't
sit with the girls,

25:48.625 --> 25:51.375
and I have to be
at the yacht club by 5:00.

25:51.458 --> 25:53.500
T.K. is counting on me,
so I have to go.

25:53.583 --> 25:56.583
- What's a T.K.?
- No, it's a who.
It's my client.

25:56.667 --> 26:01.417
Yeah, I'm the dessert
for 150 people, and I have
to come up with a concept,

26:01.500 --> 26:04.625
and I have to get
everything ready
before I leave the house.

26:04.709 --> 26:08.041
- I can't do it
because I got a meeting.
- Honey, please? Please?

26:08.125 --> 26:10.291
- No.
- Honey, please! Come on!

26:10.375 --> 26:12.291
I can't count
on anybody but you.

26:12.375 --> 26:15.709
I never could count
on anybody but you,

26:15.792 --> 26:19.166
and I don't know what
I'm going to do if you
don't take the babies.

26:19.250 --> 26:21.709
OK. Stop for a second.
No more crying. Don't cry.

26:21.792 --> 26:25.166
Not with the... [mimics sobs]
Just give me the girls.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.083
- Really? Oh, God, thank you.
- Yes. Give me the girls.

26:28.166 --> 26:30.417
Thank you. Thank you.
Give me a kiss.

26:30.500 --> 26:32.959
OK, I have to go,
so be good.

26:33.041 --> 26:34.291
Wish me luck, OK?

26:34.375 --> 26:36.125
- Good luck!
- I love you guys! Be good!

26:37.583 --> 26:41.083
- You have a teeny office.
- And it doesn't have a door.

26:42.291 --> 26:43.417
[sighs]

26:46.208 --> 26:48.208
Get it out!

26:48.291 --> 26:50.917
Get the staple remover
out of your sister's hair
now, please.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.125
Please, I'm just asking
you... OK. Just take it
out of her hair.

26:54.208 --> 26:55.917
- But she has knots.
- Ow!

26:56.000 --> 26:59.583
Don't forget. We've got
a Berrytown focus group
meeting in five minutes.

26:59.667 --> 27:03.583
Does it look like I'm going
to be ready for a focus
group in five minutes?

27:03.667 --> 27:07.583
- Can you get somebody else?
- It's a focus group
for Berrytown.

27:07.667 --> 27:10.458
- Bring the kids.
- OK. I'll be there.

27:14.417 --> 27:18.000
- Unsound mind?
- Yes, Your Honor.

27:18.083 --> 27:22.000
- You agree with this opinion?
- He's absolutely certifiable.

27:22.083 --> 27:25.875
I've got to say I'm
predisposed to grant your
request for annulment.

27:25.959 --> 27:27.834
I just have
a few questions.

27:27.917 --> 27:30.709
For starters,
how long have you two
known one another?

27:30.792 --> 27:34.000
- Only two weeks, Your Honor.
- Is that all it's been?

27:34.083 --> 27:37.000
- If you don't
include the, uh...
- Right. The lap dance.

27:37.083 --> 27:40.291
Even still, it feels
like I've known her
much longer.

27:40.375 --> 27:42.542
- I know.
It's weird, actually.
- Yeah.

27:44.208 --> 27:46.458
Have you consummated
the marriage?

27:46.542 --> 27:50.667
- Yes. Yes, it was great.
- Great.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.417
- It was, wasn't it?
- When you twisted
your ankle?

27:53.500 --> 27:57.500
- Right. Going over
the threshold.
- No, during, you know...

27:57.583 --> 28:00.417
Oh, yeah. Right. Yes.

28:02.625 --> 28:05.500
So what's the problem?

28:06.500 --> 28:08.583
The problem is...

28:14.500 --> 28:17.667
The problem
is ending a marriage
shouldn't be this easy.

28:17.750 --> 28:20.709
- What?
- I mean, we can
sit here all day

28:20.792 --> 28:23.917
and try to come up
with reasons why
we shouldn't be married.

28:25.583 --> 28:30.125
But the truth is,
something got us
to that altar, you know?

28:30.208 --> 28:35.083
And when I was
standing there with you,
it felt right.

28:36.291 --> 28:38.291
It did to me, too.

28:42.458 --> 28:46.709
This is sweet. You do know
better than to waste my time
like this, don't you?

28:46.792 --> 28:47.959
Yes, Your Honor.

28:48.041 --> 28:50.125
Please take your wife
and get the hell out.

28:53.125 --> 28:54.917
Thank you.

28:56.959 --> 28:58.709
- Is that game fun?
- [knock on door]

28:58.792 --> 29:02.041
Hi. Hi. You got room
for two more?

29:02.125 --> 29:05.250
- Absolutely.
The more the berrier.
- The more the berrier.

29:05.333 --> 29:07.041
That's funny.
Give me a kiss.

29:07.125 --> 29:09.542
Bye-bye. Have fun.
I'll be behind the mirror.

29:09.625 --> 29:13.750
Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.
Sorry about that.

29:16.917 --> 29:20.083
What we're looking
for today is honesty.

29:20.166 --> 29:22.458
Don't tell me what
you think I want to hear.

29:22.542 --> 29:24.834
Just tell me
how you feel. OK?

29:24.917 --> 29:26.959
So who wants to go first?

29:27.041 --> 29:32.041
- And what's your name?
- Geneva Greco,
552 Breeze Lane.

29:32.125 --> 29:33.875
That's my girl.

29:33.959 --> 29:37.583
My mommy and daddy
are getting a divorce.
They fight a lot.

29:37.667 --> 29:39.125
OK.

29:39.208 --> 29:42.875
Well, Geneva, why don't
you tell me what you think
of Berrytown?

29:42.959 --> 29:45.208
My dad says
Berrytown sucks.

29:46.834 --> 29:49.417
That quote
was taken completely
out of context.

29:49.500 --> 29:54.166
Daddy? Daddy,
are you in there? Hello.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.750
I like
your old job better.

29:59.875 --> 30:02.792
Then we got into
this ridiculous fight
about cupcakes.

30:02.875 --> 30:04.500
And I have no idea why.

30:04.583 --> 30:08.458
I mean, yes,
she's been going through
a terrible time too.

30:08.542 --> 30:11.917
She's separated and
if anyone has a reason
to jump into a big bowl

30:12.000 --> 30:14.875
of chocolate frosting,
it's her.
And never come out.

30:14.959 --> 30:19.041
But, you know, she's
out there, doing it and
I was just trying to help.

30:19.125 --> 30:21.917
I even got her
her first order.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.166
- It was...
- Enough already
with the cupcakes!

30:25.250 --> 30:27.458
This is a grief group,
not a baking circle!

30:27.542 --> 30:29.750
We have serious issues
to discuss here.

30:29.834 --> 30:33.917
Like grief. And mourning.
A cupcake is not
a serious thing.

30:34.041 --> 30:35.834
It's a novelty act.

30:35.917 --> 30:41.500
It's a ridiculous,
frivolous little...
just wannabe cake.

30:43.875 --> 30:47.000
- You're not talking
about grief.
- I'm not?

30:47.083 --> 30:50.417
- No.
- Oh, my God.

30:52.125 --> 30:56.125
Oh, my God.
I haven't thought
about Angelo for...

30:58.917 --> 31:00.625
...two and a half hours.

31:00.709 --> 31:02.250
I haven't thought
about him.

31:03.500 --> 31:06.667
- I'm sorry, honey.
- You know what, guys?

31:06.750 --> 31:11.709
The truth is, that
sometimes, distraction
can be a good thing.

31:11.792 --> 31:14.000
If I don't think
about him, who will?

31:14.083 --> 31:17.083
If he doesn't live
in my mind...

31:19.792 --> 31:23.542
...then he really is dead.

31:23.625 --> 31:27.458
Nicole, he wouldn't want you
to waste your life away
thinking about him.

31:27.542 --> 31:30.583
So does this mean
we still have to talk
about cupcakes?

31:36.125 --> 31:39.125
It's a cupcake
anniversary cake.
What do you think?

31:40.500 --> 31:42.041
I...
It's a great concept.

31:42.125 --> 31:43.709
- Yeah?
- I love it. I really do.

31:43.792 --> 31:45.041
Just a couple more.

31:45.125 --> 31:48.041
- Let me help you.
- No. I got it.

31:48.125 --> 31:51.041
You know, I...
I notice that you...

31:51.125 --> 31:54.583
Thank you.
You wear a wedding ring.

31:54.667 --> 31:58.500
Uh... I'm separated.
Well, I'm newly
separated.

31:59.667 --> 32:02.041
Thank God I asked or
I never would have known.

32:02.125 --> 32:04.500
So what does the T.K.
stand for?

32:04.583 --> 32:07.375
I ask because
my friend and I
were trying to guess.

32:07.458 --> 32:09.625
You talked about me
with your friend?

32:09.709 --> 32:11.917
No. I mean, yes.
But, not like...

32:12.000 --> 32:14.583
I don't think I know you
well enough to tell you.

32:14.667 --> 32:17.083
You'll have to hire me
to cater another party.

32:17.166 --> 32:20.834
Yes, or, maybe, uh,
sometime you and I
could go out?

32:22.333 --> 32:24.750
[clears throat]

32:24.834 --> 32:28.458
You got to do Daddy
a favor, OK? Everybody
needs to play nice.

32:28.542 --> 32:31.750
Sit right here and
give Daddy a little bit
of quiet time, OK?

32:31.834 --> 32:33.583
Little quiet time
for Daddy.

32:33.667 --> 32:35.667
- [girls] Quiet time!
- Very funny, girls.

32:35.750 --> 32:37.917
Daddy's glad you have
his sense of humor,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.834
but right now Daddy needs you
to just go find a really

32:40.917 --> 32:43.917
long movie, and sit there
and watch it in silence, OK?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.458
- Daddy! Daddy! Look!
- No, no.

32:46.542 --> 32:51.166
- Quiet, please. No talking.
- But Daddy, Carrie's walking!

32:51.834 --> 32:53.500
What?

32:57.333 --> 33:00.667
Oh, my God. Carrie!
Carrie! Come here!
Come here!

33:00.750 --> 33:03.667
Come to me!
Come here! Come here!
Walk over to Daddy!

33:03.750 --> 33:06.458
Come here! Come to me!
Come here! Come here!

33:06.542 --> 33:09.500
Walk over to Daddy!
Come on! Come on!

33:09.583 --> 33:11.750
Come on! Come to Dad.
Come to Dad.

33:11.834 --> 33:14.709
Come on!
Come to Daddy, Carrie.

33:14.792 --> 33:18.458
Come to Daddy.
Oh, my goodness.

33:18.542 --> 33:21.333
Oh, you did
such a great job.

33:21.417 --> 33:23.250
All right, come on.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.250
[bell jingles]

33:29.291 --> 33:30.917
[knocking]

33:31.709 --> 33:34.750
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:38.792 --> 33:40.834
The party went
really well, I think.

33:40.917 --> 33:43.750
I mean, I came up
with a great concept.

33:45.458 --> 33:49.917
- You were right about that.
- Good. I'm glad.

33:55.250 --> 33:57.792
I'm so sorry, Nic.

33:57.875 --> 34:01.500
Can we just forget
what I said?

34:01.583 --> 34:04.959
I need you. I can't
do this by myself.

34:06.667 --> 34:08.125
I don't even want to.

34:08.208 --> 34:10.583
I'm sorry too.
I was being so bossy.

34:10.667 --> 34:13.333
Well, it's kind of
my thing.

34:14.667 --> 34:16.917
I realized something
being your partner.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.291
It's helping me
keep my mind off things.
